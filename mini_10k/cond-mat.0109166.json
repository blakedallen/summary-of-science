The study\nof such systems not only provides invaluable insight into\nthe non-trivial global behavior of a population of competing agents, but also has potential application in economics, biology and finance. Moreover, we can study\ncomplex adaptive systems from the perspective of statistical physics.\nThe El Farol bar problem [1], which was proposed by\nW. B. Arthur in 1994, has greatly influenced and stimulated the study of complex adaptive systems in the last\nfew years. It describes a system of N agents deciding independently in each week whether to go to a bar or not on\na certain night. As space is limited, the bar is enjoyable\nonly if it is not too crowded. Agents are not allowed to\ncommunicate directly with each other and their choices\nare not affected by previous decisions. The only public\ninformation available to agents is how many agents came\nin last week. To enjoy an uncrowded bar, each agent has\nto employ some hypotheses or mental models to guess\nwhether one should go or not. With bounded rationality,\nall agents use inductive reasoning rather than perfect, deductive reasoning since the system is ill-defined. In other\nwords, agents act upon their currently most credible hypothesis based on the past performance of their hypotheses. Consequently, agents can interact indirectly with\neach other through their hypotheses in use. The emerging system is thus both evolutionary and complex adaptive in the presence of those inductive reasoning agents.\nInspired by the El Farol bar problem, Challet and\nZhang put forward the Minority Game (MG) [2, 3]. It is\na toy model of N inductive reasoning players who have to\nchoose one out of two alternatives independently at each\ntime step. Those who end up in the minority side (that\nis, the choice with the least number of players) win. The\nonly public information available to all players in the MG\nis the winning alternatives of the last M passes, known\nas the history. Players have to employ some strategies\nbased on the history to guess the winning choice. In fact,\nthey may employ more than one strategy throughout the\n\ngame. More precisely, every player picks once and for\nall S randomly drawn strategies from a suitably chosen\nstrategy space before playing the game. The performance\nof each strategy will be recorded during the game. Then\nplayers make decision according to their current best performing strategy at every time step.\nIn spite of its simplicity, MG displays a remarkably\nrich emergent collective behavior. Numerical simulations\nshowed that there is a second order phase transition\nbetween a symmetric phase and an asymmetric phase\n[4, 5, 6]. There is no predictive information about the\nnext minority group available to agent's strategies in the\nsymmetric phase, whereas there is predictive information\navailable to agent's strategies in the asymmetric phase.\nMG addresses the interaction between agents and public\ninformation, that is, how agents react to public information and how the feedback modify the public information itself. Later works revealed that the dynamics of\nthe system in fact minimizes a global function related to\nmarket predictability [7, 8]. Therefore, the MG can be\ndescribed as a disordered spin system [7, 8]. Hart and\nhis coworkers found that the fluctuations arising in the\nMG is controlled by the interplay between crowds of likeminded agents and their anti-correlated partners [9, 10].\nSince MG is a prototype to study detailed pattern of fluctuations, it plays a dominant role in economic activities\nlike the market mechanism. In order to learn more on\nMG-like systems, much effort was put on the extension\nof the MG model, such as the introduction of evolution\n[11] and the modification of MG for modelling the real\nmarket [12, 13].\nIn the real world, however, an agent usually has more\nthan two options. For example, people decide where to\ndine or which share to buy from a stock market. Consequently, it is worthwhile to investigate the situation\nwhere players have more than two choices especially when\nthe number of choices is large. Indeed, D'Hulst and\nRodgers [14] has written a paper on the three-choice minority game. In their paper, a symmetric and an asymmetric three-sided models are introduced. Their symmetric model is only a model which mimics the cyclic\ntrading between three players using the same strategy\n\n\f2\nformalism as MG and thus cannot be extended to realistic cases with a large number of choices. Furthermore,\ntheir asymmetric model is nothing but the original minority game with the possibility allowing players not to\nparticipate in a turn. Hence, the player's choice is not\nsymmetric.\nRecently, Ein-Dor et al. proposed a multichoice minority game based on neural network [15]. Their model\ngeneralizes the El Farol bar problem to the case of multiple choice. Nevertheless, it differs quite significantly from\nthe MG of Challet and Zhang as each player has only one\nstrategy to use and that strategy evolves according to its\nperformance. Besides, no phase transition of any kind\nis observed in Ein-Dor et al.'s model. Chau and Chow\nalso proposed another multichoice minority game model\nbased on MG [16]. In this model, players choosing their\nstrategies from a reduced strategy space consists of anticorrelated and uncorrelated strategies only.\nIn this paper, we propose a new model called the multiple choices minority game (MCMG) with a neural network flavor. It is a variation of the MG where all heterogeneous, inductive thinking players have more than two\nchoices. Just like the original MG, strategies in MCMG\nare not evolving and they are picked in each turn according to their current performance. In Section II, the\nMCMG model are explained in detail. Results of numerical simulation of our model are presented and discussed\nin Section III. We also compare our results with those of\nthe original MG as well. In the Section IV, we deliver a\nbrief summary and an outlook of our work.\nII.\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nLet us consider a repeated game of a population of N\nplayers. At each time step, every players has to choose\none of Nc rooms/choices independently. Here, we assume\nthat Nc is a prime power and we identify the Nc rooms\nwith elements in the finite field GF (Nc ). We represent\nthe choice of the ith player at time t by \u03c7i (t) which only\n\"takes on\" the Nc different rooms. Those players in the\nroom with the least number of players, that is, in the\nminority side, win. The winning room at time t is the\npublicly known output of the game \u03a9(t). The players of\nthe winning room will gain one unit of wealth while all\nthe others lose one. So the wealth of the ith player, wi (t),\nis updated by\nwi (t + 1) = wi (t) + 2\u03b4(\u03c7i (t) \u2212 \u03a9(t)) \u2212 1,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b4(0) = 1 and \u03b4(x) = 0 whenever x 6= 0. Note\nthat the output of the last M steps, \u03bc(t) \u2261 (\u03a9(t \u2212 M +\n1), . . . , \u03a9(t \u2212 1)), is the only public information available\nto all players. Therefore, players can only interact indirectly with each other through the history \u03bc(t) which can\ntake on NcM different values.\nAimed at maximizing one's own wealth, each player\nhas to employ some strategies to predict the trend of the\noutput of the game. But how to define a strategy? For\n\na minority game with more than two choices, it is not\neffective to formulate the strategy as in MG. Recall that\nin MG, a strategy is defined as a number of set of choices\ncorresponding to different histories. In other words, a\nstrategy is a map sending each \u03bc(t) to the choice 0/1.\nM\nTherefore, there are 22 different strategies in the full\nstrategy space for MG.\nSimilar numerical results of the fluctuation arising in\nthe MG are obtained if strategies are drawn from the reduced strategy space instead of the full strategy space\n[2, 4]. Hence, the reduced strategy space plays a fundamental role in the properties of the fluctuation arising in the MG. The reduced stratgey space is formed\nby strategies which are significantly different from each\nother. Given a strategy s, only its uncorrelated and anticorrelated strategies are significantly different from it.\nIndeed, the reduced strategy space is composed of two\nensembles of mutually uncorrelated strategies where the\nanti-correlated strategy of any strategy in one ensemble\nalways exists in the other ensemble. For MG, there are\n2M+1 different strategies in the reduced strategy space\n[2, 4].\nFor a minority game with Nc rooms using the form\nNM\nof strategy in MG, there are Nc c different strategies in\nthe full strategy space while there are NcM+1 different\nstrategies in the reduced strategy space provided that\nNc is a prime power. Because the strategy space size\nincreases rapidly as Nc increases, strategies will quickly\nget out of control for large Nc . Consequently, we would\nlike to define the strategy in a different way.\nIn our game, we do not restrict players to have only\n\"good strategies\" since each player (who thinks inductively) does not know whether a strategy is good or not\nbefore commences the game. \"Good strategy\" is time\ndependent. In fact, players will adapt with each other\nin order to use those \"good strategies\". Therefore, all\nstrategies must be uniform in the following sense:\n1) any input \u03bc(t) can produce any output \u03c7i (t),\n2) there are same probability for any output produced\nby any input.\nIndeed, it is not completely clear that whether those\nstrategies used in the Ein-Dor et al.'s model are uniform in the above sense. With the above consideration, a\ns\nstrategy s consists of weights (\u03c91s , . . . , \u03c9M\n) \u2208 GF (Nc )M\nand a uniform random variable called bias \u03c1s \u2208 GF (Nc )\nsatisfying the following condition:\nM\nX\n\n\u03c9js = \u03b7\n\n(2)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere \u03b7 is a fixed constant in GF (Nc ). Note that all\nthe arithemetic used to generate a strategy and the corresponding choice (including Eq. (2) above and Eq. (3)\nbelow) are performed in the finite field GF (Nc ). The\nchoice is defined to be the sum of the weighted sum of\nthe last M output plus the bias. Namely, the choice of\n\n\f3\nthe ith player using the strategy s with history \u03bc(t) is\ngiven by:\n\u03bc(t)\n\n\u03c7i,si (t) = \u03c1s +\n\nM\nX\n\n\u03c9js \u03a9(t \u2212 j)\n\nsimply by tossing an unbiased coin. It is easy to check\nthat the probability for the attendance Aj (t) equal to x\nin the coin-toss case is given by\n\n(3)\n\nN\n\np(Aj (t) = x) = PN\n\nj=1\n\nPhysically, the weight \u03c9js represents the importance of\nthe output of the game of jth pass before on the choice.\nIt is obvious that the strategies of MCMG all fulfil the\nuniform criteria which was mentioned before.\nSince the weights of a strategy are M independent\nvariable in GF (Nc ) which satisfy a single constraint,\nnamely Eq. (2), there are NcM\u22121 different combinations\nof weights \u03c9js . Moreover, it can be shown that strategies\nwith the same set of weights are anti-correlated with each\nother while the others are uncorrelated with each other\n(see Ref. [16]). Hence, it follows that both the full and\nreduced strategy space size in MCMG is equal to NcM .\nThus, the strategy space size of MCMG is much smaller\nthan that of MG.\nIn our model, every player picks and sticks to S randomly drawn strategies before commences the game. We\n(i)\n(i)\ndenote the strategies of the ith player by (s1 , . . . , sS ).\nBut how does a player decide which strategy is the best?\nPlayers use the virtual score, which is just the hypothetical profit for using a single strategy in the game, to estimate the performance of a strategy. In each pass, the\nvirtual score of a strategy s of the ith player, Usi (t), is\nupdated by\n\u03bc(t)\n\nUsi (t) = Usi (t \u2212 1) + 2\u03b4(\u03c7i,s \u2212 \u03a9(t)) \u2212 1\n\n(4)\n\n\u03bc(t)\n\nwhere \u03c7i,s is the choice of the ith player under history\n\u03bc(t) using the strategy s. Each player uses one's own\nstrategy with the highest virtual score. Although our\nMCMG model is quite similar to the MG model, there are\ntwo main differences, namely, in the number of choices of\nplayers and in the formalism of strategies.\nIn our game, the aim of each player is to maximize\none's own wealth which can be in turn achieved by the\nmaximization of the global profit. So the quantity of\ninterest is\n\u03c3j2 = h(Aj (t))2 i \u2212 hAj (t)i2\n\u2261 h(Aj (t) \u2212 N/Nc )2 i,\n\n(5)\n\nnamely, the variance of the attendance of room j, where\nthe attendance of a room is just the number of people\nchosen that room. Indeed, the maximum global profit\nwill be achieved if and only if the largest possible minority\nsize \u230aN/Nc \u230b is attained. So the expected attendance of\nall rooms should be equal to N/Nc for players to gain\nas much as possible. Accordingly, the variance of the\nattendance of a room represents the loss of players in the\ngame.\nIn order to investigate the significance of the strategies,\nwe would like to compare the variance with the coin-toss\ncase value in which all the players make their decision\n\nCx (Nc \u2212 1)N \u2212x\n\nx=1\n\nNC (N\nx\nc\n\n\u2212 1)N \u2212x\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere NCx = N !/[x!(N \u2212 x)!].

In each run, we took the average values on 15,000 steps after running 10,000 steps for\nequilibrium starting from initialization.\n\nA.\n\nComparison of two-room MCMG with MG\n\nWe first want to investigate if the performance of players are different in MG and the two-room MCMG. We\napplied the two models to study the properties of the\nmean attendance as a function of the control parameter\n\u03b1 as shown in figure 1. The control parameter \u03b1 measures the ratio of the reduced strategy space size to the\nnumber of strategies at play. Specifically, \u03b1 = 2M+1 /N S\nfor the MG and \u03b1 = NcM /N S for the MCMG. We have\nonly studied the properties of the attendance of one of\nthe rooms as the attendance of the two rooms have the\nsame behavior due to symmetry [1].\nIn both MG and the two room MCMG, the mean attendance always fluctuates around the expected value\nN/2 no matter how large is the control parameter (see figure 1). Therefore, we believe that players have the same\nperformance in both MG and the two room MCMG if we\nonly consider the mean attendance. To further investigate the difference of the performance of players in MG\nand the two-room MCMG, we studied the variance of the\nattendance as a function of the control parameter which\nwas shown in figure 2.\nBefore making comparsion with that in the MCMG,\nlet us first take a brief review on the properties of the\nvariance in MG as shown in figure 2 [4, 5, 6]. In MG,\nthere is a great variance \u03c3 2 when the control parameter \u03b1\nis small. It is because players use very similar strategies\nwhen the reduced strategy space size (= 2M+1 ) is much\nsmaller than the number of strategies at play (= N S).\n\n\f4\n60\n\n10\n\nS\nS\nS\n\n58\n56\n\n= 3\n\nN\n\n= 4\n1\n\n= 3\n= 4\n\n/\n\n52\n\n= 2\n\n2\n\n<A>\n\n54\n\nS\nS\nS\n\n= 2\n\n50\n48\n46\n\nMG\n\n0.1\n\nMG\n\n44\n42\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n= 2\n\nM\n\n+1\n\n10\n\n/\n\nNS\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n= 2\n\nM\n\n10\n\n+1\n\n/\n\nNS\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n10\n60\n\n56\n\n= 3\n1\n\n= 3\n= 4\n\n/\n\n= 4\n\n= 2\n\n52\n\n2\n\n<A>\n\n54\n\nS\nS\nS\n\n= 2\n\nN\n\nS\nS\nS\n\n58\n\n50\n48\n\nMCMG\n\nNc\n\n46\n44\n\nMCMG\n\nNc\n\n0.1\n\n= 2\n\n42\n\n0.01\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n=\n\nN NS\n\n100\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n1000\n\n=\n\nM\nc /\n\nFIG. 1: The mean attendance hAi versus the control parameter \u03b1 in MG and MCMG with Nc = 2 where N = 101.\n\nSuch overcrowding of strategies will lead to small minority size and also great fluctuation of the attendance.\nWhen the reduced strategy space size increases, the variance decreases rapidly since players are able to cooperate more with less overcrowding effect. Subsequently, the\nvariance attains a minimum when the number of strategies at play is approximately equal to the reduced strategy space size. In fact, maximum cooperation is attained\nwhen all the strategies in the reduced strategy space are\nused by players. As the slope of the variance changes\ndiscontinuously at the minimum point, it strongly suggests that there is a second order phase transition. The\nphase transition was also confirmed by analytical method\n[7, 17]. After the minimum point, the variance increases\nand gradually tends to the coin-toss case value when the\ncontrol parameter \u03b1 increases further. It is due to more\nand more insufficient sampling of the reduced strategy\nspace when the reduced strategy space size become much\nand much larger than the number of strategies at play.\nConsequently, there is less and less difference between\nchoosing by random or using strategies. In addition, the\nproperties of the variance are found to be similar for different number of strategies S.\nFor the MCMG, the variance of the attendance of a\nroom, \u03c3 2 , exhibits similar behavior as a function of the\ncontrol parameter \u03b1 (= NcM /N S for MCMG) to that in\n\nNcM NS\n\n= 2\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n/\n\nFIG. 2: The variance \u03c3 2 versus the control parameter \u03b1 in\nMG and MCMG with Nc = 2 where N = 101.\n\nMG no matter what the number of strategies S is. For\nexample, the variance tends to the coin-toss case value\nfor sufficiently large control parameter. Moreover, there\nis again an indication of a second order phase transition.\nTo check if the phase transition is second order or not,\nwe calculate the order parameter [7, 16]\n(\n\u00152 )\n\u0014\n1 X X\n1\n\u03b8= M\nhp(\u03a9|\u03bc)i \u2212\nNc \u03bc\nNc\n\n(9)\n\n\u03a9\n\nwhere hp(\u03a9|\u03bc)i denotes the conditional time average of\nthe probability for \u03a9(t) = \u03a9 given that \u03bc(t) = \u03bc. In\nfact, the order parameter measures the bias of player's\ndecision to any choice for individual history.\nFigure 3 shows that the order parameter vanishes when\nthe control parameter is smaller than its value corresponding to minimum variance. As a result, we confirm\nthat the phase transition is a second order one. Although\nour two-room MCMG model does not exactly coincide\nwith the MG model, the variance has almost the same\nproperties as a function of the control parameter in both\nmodels. However, the behaviour of the variance as a\nfunction of the memory size M are different in MG and\nMCMG because the reduced strategy space size are different in the two models.\n\n\f5\nMCMG. Figures 4 and 5 show the mean attendance and\nthe variance of the attendance of different rooms versus\nthe control parameter \u03b1.\nWe found that the behavior of the attendance of different rooms are almost the same in MCMG with Nc \u2265 2\nbecause there is same probability for any choice to be the\nminority side. As we only want to focus on the study of\nthe attendance of a room, not on their high order correlation, so we will stick to one of them from now on.\n\n0.025\n\n0.020\n\nNc\n\n= 2\n\n/\n\nN\n\n0.015\n\nMCMG\n\n0.010\n\n0.005\n\n0.1\n\n=\n\n1\n\nNcM NS\n/\n\nFIG. 3: The order parameter \u03b8 versus the control parameter\n\u03b1 in MCMG with Nc = 2 where M = 6.\n\nB.\n\nThe attendance in MCMG with different Nc\n\nC.\n\n0.000\n\nThe attendance of different rooms in MCMG\n\n35.5\n\nNow, we investigate the properties of the attendance\nfor MCMG with different number of rooms Nc . Figure 6\ndepicts the dependence of the mean attendance on the\ncontrol parameter \u03b1 for MCMG with Nc = 3 to 7. In\nMCMG with different Nc , the mean attendance fluctuates around N/Nc irrespective of the control parameter\n\u03b1.

In this figure, we\nhave divided the variance by N/Nc (\u2248 largest possible\nminority size) in order to have an objective comparison\nof the variance for different Nc .\nNo matter what is the value of Nc , there is always\na cusp of the variance which strongly suggests the occurence of a second order phase transition (see figure 7). We calculate the order parameter \u03b8 (introduced\nin Eq.(10)) to identify the order of the phase transition\nas shown in figure 8. In MCMG with different Nc , the\norder parameter vanishes when the control parameter is\nsmaller than its value at the cusp. Therefore, we conclude\nthat there is a second order phase transition in MCMG\nwith different Nc .\nMoreover, the variance tends to a constant value when\nthe control parameter \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e.

In other words, the variance does tend to the\ncoin-toss case value as \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e in MCMG with different\nNc . As a result, we conclude that the variance in MCMG,\nno matter what Nc is, has very similar properties with\nrespect to the control parameter as in MG.\nSince the variance shows a second order phase transition, it is instructive to investigate if \u03b1o , the value of\n\u03b1 corresponding to minimum \u03c3 2 , depends on Nc or not.\n\nNc\n\nFIG. 9: Estimated values of \u03b1o and \u03c3 2 o in MCMG with different Nc where S = 2.\n\nWe found that in MCMG, \u03b1o decreases as Nc increases.\nWe may explain this phenomenon as follows: For MCMG\nwith more number of rooms, more strategies at play are\nrequired such that players can use all the strategies in the\n\n\f7\nComparison of player's wealth for different Nc\n\nWe proceed to study the properties of player's wealth\nin the MCMG.

Figures 10 and 11 display the results for Nc = 3. The two\nfigures indicate that the behavior of the attendance as a\nfunction of the control parameter \u03b1 for different number\nof strategies S are similar, just like the case of MG and\nMCMG with Nc = 2. In conclusion, the attendance in\nMCMG has very similar properties with respect to the\ncontrol parameter as in MG no matter how many choices\nand strategies players have.\n\nD.\n\nmean player's wealth/10\n\nreduced strategy space. Since maximum cooperation is\nattained when all the strategies in the reduced strategy\nspace are used by players, so the value of \u03b1o is larger for\nMCMG with more number of rooms. We also found that\nthe scaled variance \u03c3o2 /(N/Nc ) increases as Nc increases.\nIt is due to the increase of difficulty for players to cooperate with each other when there are more choices for\nthem.\n\n-12\n\n-14\n\n-16\n\n-18\n\n-20\n\n-22\n\n36.5\n36.0\n\nS\nS\nS\n\n35.5\n35.0\n\n<A>\n\n34.5\n\n0.1\n\n= 2\n\n= 4\n\n34.0\n\nNcM NS\n\n1\n\n=\n\n= 3\n\n10\n\n/\n\nFIG. 12: Comparison of the mean player's wealth versus the\ncontrol parameter \u03b1 in MCMG with different Nc where S = 2.\n\n33.5\n33.0\n\nMCMG\n\n32.5\n\nNc\n\n32.0\n31.5\n\n= 3\n\n-8\n\n-10\n\n31.0\n1\n\n10\n\n=\n\nN NS\nM\nc /\n\n100\n\n1000\n3\n\n0.1\n\nFIG. 10: The mean attendance hAi versus the control parameter \u03b1 in MCMG with Nc = 3 where N = 101.\n\nS\nS\nS\n\n= 3\n\n-12\n\n-14\n\n-16\n\n-18\n\n-20\n\n-22\n\n-24\n\n-26\n\n= 4\n0.1\n\nN\n\n1\n\n= 2\n\nmax. player's wealth/10\n\n0.01\n\n/\n\n2\n\nMCMG\n\nNc\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n=\n\nN NS\nM\nc /\n\nNcM NS\n\n1\n\n=\n\n10\n\n/\n\nFIG. 13: Comparison of the maximum player's wealth versus\nthe control parameter \u03b1 in MCMG with different Nc where\nS = 2.\n\n= 3\n\n100\n\n1000\n\nFIG. 11: The variance \u03c3 2 versus the control parameter \u03b1 in\nMCMG with Nc = 3 where N = 101.\n\nFrom figures 12 and 13, we notice that player's wealth\ndisplays similar behavior for MCMG with different number of rooms Nc . When the reduced strategy space size\nis much smaller than the number of strategies at play,\nthe mean player's wealth remains almost constant as the\ncontrol parameter \u03b1 increases. When \u03b1 is small, the system is in the overcrowding phase where all the rooms\n\n\f8\nhave the same chance to \"win\". Therefore, all the players, on average, always win the same number of times\nand make the same amount of profit for small \u03b1. Then\nthe mean player's wealth attains a maximum value near\nthe point of minimum variance when the reduced strategy space size is approximately equal to the number of\nstrategies at play. If the control parameter \u03b1 increases\nfurther, the number of players N is comparable to the\nnumber of rooms Nc . Thus, finite size effect is important. In this case, some of the rooms will have a higher\nchance to \"win\". Then some of the players will always\nlose while some of them will always win in the game. As\na result, the mean player's wealth decreases rapidly when\nthe control parameter \u03b1 increases further.\nThe properties of the maximum player's wealth is similar to the mean player's wealth except there is a significant peak correponding to maximum cooperation of\nplayers. Although players on average always perform\nthe same for small \u03b1, but the smart players can perform much better when the small control parameter \u03b1 increases. Therefore, those smart players is wealthier when\nthe control parameter \u03b1 \u2192 1+ .\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nAlthough the MCMG and MG models are not exactly\nthe same, our work shows that the attendance of a room\nin MCMG has similar behavior to that in MG as a function of the control parameter.
