This concept arises in a very natural\nway in connection with the pseudo-Hermiticity property, in the sense that for\nany \u03b7-pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian H, U = eiH is trivially \u03b7-unitary.\nIn this context, we intend to extend the definition of generalized parity,\ncharge-conjugation and generalized time-reversal operators to the class of nondiagonalizable pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians, which can sometimes occur in\nphysics (for instance, they can be obtained from the diagonalizable ones for\nsome critical parameter values).\nAt the same time, these generalized operators will be also used in order to\ndescribe the full set of symmetries of a pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian (according to a fourfold classification), proving so that a very deep connection exists\nbetween the two topics above.\nIn order to achieve this twofold goal, we premise in Sec. 2 a proposition which\nprovides a necessary and sufficient condition for a non Hermitian operator with\ndiscrete spectrum to admit a linear, involutory symmetry. Next, we define in\nSec. 3 two families of generalized parity and charge-conjugation operators {P\u03c3 }\nand {C\u03c3 } respectively, and a (antilinear) generalized time-reversal operator T\nassociated with a nondiagonalizable pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian H, showing\nthat H is P\u03c3 -pseudo-Hermitian, and that C\u03c3 , T P\u03c3 and C\u03c3 T P\u03c3\u2032 are involutory\nsymmetries of H.\nIn Sec. 4 we begin the study of the indefinite inner product spaces (actually,\nKrein spaces) that can be obtained by considering a new (possibly indefinite)\ninner product in our Hilbert space. In Sec. 5 we firstly recall a previous,\nexhaustive classification of the symmetries S of Krein spaces [9], which brings\ninto consideration the P -pseudounitary, P -antiunitary and P -pseudoantiunitary\noperators, besides the P -unitary ones. In particular we consider the subset SH\nof the elements of S which commute with H, and we show that the P -antiunitary\nsymmetries, both in S and in SH , can be generated by some of the generalized\noperators previously introduced, namely T P and CT P . Moreover, a necessary\nand sufficient condition is provided for a (possibly) nondiagonalizable pseudoHermitian Hamiltonian H to admit a P -reflecting symmetry which generates\nthe P -pseudounitary and P -pseudoantiunitary symmetries in SH , and a possible\nphysical meaning of such operator is suggested.\nFinally, in Sec. 6 a physical model is considered which allows us to illustrate\nall the above results (and some hints on the P -unitary evolution of a physical\nsystem are also given), whereas Sec. 7 contains some concluding remarks.\n2\n\n\f2\n\nNon Hermitian operators and linear involutory symmetries\n\nFollowing [10] and [11], we consider here only linear operators H acting in a\nseparable Hilbert space H and having discrete spectrum. Moreover, throughout\nthis paper we shall assume that all the eigenvalues En of H have finite algebraic\nmultiplicity gn and that there is a basis of H in which H is block-diagonal\nwith finite-dimensional diagonal blocks. Then, a complete biorthonormal basis\nE = {|\u03c8 n , a, ii , |\u03c6n , a, ii} exists such that the operator H can be written in the\nfollowing form [10]:\nH=\n\ndn\nXX\n\npn,a \u22121\n\npn,a\n\n(En\n\nn a=1\n\nX\ni=1\n\n|\u03c8 n , a, ii h\u03c6n , a, i| +\n\nX\n\n|\u03c8 n , a, ii h\u03c6n , a, i + 1|)\n\ni=1\n\n(3)\n\nwhere dn denotes the geometric multiplicity (i.e., the degree of degeneracy) of\nEn , a is a degeneracy label, pn,a represents the dimension of the simple Jordan\nP n\nblock Ja (En ) associated with the labels n and a (hence, da=1\npn,a = gn ).\n|\u03c8 n , a, 1i (respectively, |\u03c6n , a, pn,a i) is an eigenvector of H (respectively, H \u2020 ):\nH |\u03c8 n , a, 1i = En \u03c8 n, a, 1 ,\n\nH \u2020 |\u03c6n , a, pn,a i = En\u2217 \u03c6n, a, pn,a ,\n\n(4)\n\nand the following relations hold:\nH |\u03c8 n , a, ii = En |\u03c8 n , a, ii + |\u03c8 n , a, i \u2212 1i , i 6= 1,\nH \u2020 |\u03c6n , a, ii = En\u2217 |\u03c6n , a, ii + |\u03c6n , a, i + 1i , i 6= pn,a .\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\nThe elements of the biorthonormal basis obey the usual relations:\n\npn,a\n\ndn X\nXX\nn a=1 i=1\n\nh\u03c8 m , a, i|\u03c6n , b, ji = \u03b4 mn \u03b4 ab \u03b4 ij ,\n\n(7)\n\npn,a\n\n|\u03c8 n , a, ii h\u03c6n , a, i| =\n\ndn X\nXX\nn a=1 i=1\n\n|\u03c6n , a, ii h\u03c8 n , a, i| = 1.\n\n(8)\n\nLet us now prove a necessary and sufficient condition for a non Hermitian\nHamiltonian to admit a linear involutory symmetry (we recall that a linear\noperator C is called involutory whenever C 2 = 1).\nProposition 1. Let H be a linear operator with discrete spectrum. Then\nan involutory (non trivial) linear operator C exists such that [H, C] = 0, if and\nonly if H admits at least two linearly independent eigenvectors.\nProof. Let us suppose that a non trivial involutory operator C exists such\nthat [H, C] = 0 and that H admits only one eigenvector, namely |1i:\nH |1i = E |1i .\n\n(9)\n\nThen, a basis {|ii} exists in which\nH |ii = E |ii + |i \u2212 1i ,\n3\n\ni 6= 1.\n\n(10)\n\n\fMultiplying on the left Eq.(9) by C, and recalling that [H, C] = 0 and C 2 = 1,\none easily obtains\nC |1i = \u01eb |1i ,\n\nwhere \u01eb = \u00b11. In the same manner, from Eq.(10) (with i = 2), it follows\nHC |2i = EC |2i + \u01eb |1i .\n\n(11)\n\nand, linearly combining Eqs. (11) and (10) (with i = 2 ),\nH(\u01ebC \u2212 1) |2i = E(\u01ebC \u2212 1) |2i ,\n\ni.e.., (\u01ebC \u2212 1) |2i is an eigenvector of H. Hence,\nOn the other hand,\n\n(\u01ebC \u2212 1) |2i = \u03b2 |1i\n\n(\u03b2 \u2208 C) .\n\n0 = (\u01ebC + 1)(\u01ebC \u2212 1) |2i = (\u01ebC + 1)\u03b2 |1i = 2\u03b2 |1i ,\n\nwhich implies C |2i = \u01eb |2i . Iterating the above procedure again and again, we\nconclude that C = \u01eb1.\nP\nIn order to prove the converse implication, let Eq.(3) hold, with n dn \u2265 2;\nthen the following involutory (non trivial) operator\nC\u03c3 =\n\nn,a\ndn p\nX\nXX\n\nn a=1 i=1\n\n\u03c3 an |\u03c8 n , a, ii h\u03c6n , a, i|\n\n(12)\n\n(where \u03c3 = {\u03c3 an } denotes an arbitrary sequence of signs \u03c3 an = \u00b1 which depend\nonly on the n and a indexes) commutes with H.\u0004\nFinally, the following useful property of involutory operators holds:\nProposition 2. Every linear, involutory operator C is similar to an Hermitian operator.\nProof. Let M be a linear (in general, non unitary) invertible transformation\nwhich reduces C in its Jordan canonical form J:\nM \u22121 CM = J = D + N,\nwhere D is a (real, involutory) diagonal matrix, N is a upper triangular matrix\nand [D, N ] = 0.\nThen,\nJ 2 = D2 + 2N D + N 2 = 1,\nhence\nN (2D + N ) = 0.\nNow, observe that 2D + N is invertible, since det(2D + N ) = det 2D 6= 0;\nthen, N = 0 and the thesis follows at once.\u0004\n4\n\n\f3\n\nThe generalized C, T P and CT P symmetries\n\nIn this section we will extend to the class of non diagonalizable pseudo-Hermitian\nHamiltonians the concepts of generalized parity P , charge-conjugation C and\ntime-reversal T operators that have already proven to be very fruitful in the\ndiagonalizable case.\nAt the moment we do not dwell upon the possible physical meaning of such\noperators, which however has been clearly discussed in literature (see in particular [12] where these concepts have been successfully applied to describe\nKlein-Gordon fields). Our main goal is to obtain, for any pseudo-Hermitian\nHamiltonian, a set of linear and antilinear symmetries, whose r\u00f4le will be enlightened in the next sections.\nWith reference to the same notation adopted above, let us use the subscript \"0 \" to denote the real eigenvalues of H, and the subscripts \"\u00b1 \" to denote\nthe complex eigenvalues with positive or negative imaginary parts, respectively.\nFurthermore, we recall that for a pseudo-Hermitian operator the geometric multiplicity and the Jordan dimensions of the complex conjugate eigenvalues coincide (i.e., dn+ = dn\u2212 and pn+ = pn\u2212 ) [10]. Then, H assumes the following\nform:\n\nH\n\n=\n\ndn0\nXX\n\npn0 ,a \u22121\n\npn0 ,a\n\n(En0\n\nn0 a=1\n\nX\n\n\u03c8 n0 , a, i\n\n\u03c6n0 , a, i +\n\n\u03c8 n0 , a, i\n\n\u03c6n0 , a, i + 1 ) +\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nd\n\nX\n\np\n\nn+\nn+ ,a\nED\nED\nX X\nX\n(En+ \u03c8 n+ , a, i \u03c6n+ , a, i + En\u2212 \u03c8 n\u2212 , a, i \u03c6n\u2212 , a, i ) +\n[\n\nn+ ,n\u2212 a=1 i=1\npn+ ,a \u22121\n\nX\n\n( \u03c8 n+ , a, i\n\ni=1\n\nED\n\n\u03c6n+ , a, i + 1 + \u03c8 n\u2212 , a, i\n\nED\n\n\u03c6n\u2212 , a, i + 1 )].\n\n(13)\n\nWe can associate with H a family {P\u03c3 } of operators defined as follows:\n\nP\u03c3\n\n: =\n\ndn0 pn0 ,a\nX\nXX\nn0 a=1 i=1\nd\n\n\u03c3 an0 |\u03c6n0 , a, pn0 ,a + 1 \u2212 ii \u03c6n0 , a, i +\n\np\n\nn+ n+ ,a\nX\nX X\n\nn+ ,n\u2212 a=1 i=1\n\n\u03c3 an+ ( \u03c6n+ , a, pn+ ,a + 1 \u2212 i\n\n\u03c6n\u2212 , a, pn+ ,a + 1 \u2212 i\n\nED\n\n\u03c6n+ , a, i ).\n\nED\n\n\u03c6n\u2212 , a, i +\n(14)\n\n(where \u03c3 = {\u03c3 an } denotes an arbitrary sequence of signs \u03c3 an = \u00b1 which depend\nonly on the n and a indexes).\nIt is easy to verify that any P\u03c3 is an Hermitian operator; furthermore H is\na P\u03c3 -pseudo-Hermitian operator, that is it satisfies the relation\n5\n\n\fP\u03c3 HP\u03c3\u22121 = H \u2020 .\nObserve that the generalized parity P\u03c3 operator given in Eq.(14) generalizes\nfrom various points of view those ones introduced in [5], [4] and [2]. Indeed, as\nwe said above, it is defined for a (possibly) nondiagonalizable pseudo-Hermitian\noperator H, and it reduces to the one introduced in [5] and to the inverse of [4]\nwhenever a diagonalizable Hamiltonian is taken into account.\nMoreover if the Hamiltonian H is Hermitian with non degenerate spectrum,\nthen the generalized parity operator P\u03c3 given in Eq.(14) satisfies the following\nproperties: (i) P\u03c3 is linear and Hermitian; (ii) P\u03c3 commutes with H; (iii) P\u03c32 = 1;\n(iv) the nth eigenstate of H is also an eigenstate of P\u03c3 with eigenvalue (\u22121)n .\nHence our generalized parity operator has the same formal properties as the\ngeneralized parity operator introduced in [2].\nAnalogously, we can associate with H a family of generalized charge-conjugation\noperators given by\n\n: =\n\nC\u03c3\n\ndn0 pn0 ,a\nXX\nX\nn0 a=1 i=1\nd\n\n\u03c3 an0 |\u03c8 n0 , a, ii \u03c6n0 , a, i +\n\np\n\nn+ n+ ,a\nX\nX X\n\n\u03c3 an+ ( \u03c8 n+ , a, i\n\nn+ ,n\u2212 a=1 i=1\n\n\u03c8 n\u2212 , a, i\n\nED\n\nED\n\n\u03c6n+ , a, i +\n\n\u03c6n\u2212 , a, i ),\n\n(15)\n\nand a time-reversal operator T :\n\nT\n\n:\n\n=\n\ndn0 pn0 ,a\nX\nXX\nn0 a=1 i=1\nd\n\np\n\nn+ n+ ,a\nX X\nX\n\nn+ ,n\u2212 a=1 i=1\n\n|\u03c8 n0 , a, iiK \u03c8 n0 , a, pn0 ,a + 1 \u2212 i +\nE D\n( \u03c8 n+ , a, i K \u03c8 n+ , a, pn+ ,a + 1 \u2212 i +\n\nE D\n\u03c8 n\u2212 , a, i K \u03c8 n\u2212 , a, pn\u2212 ,a + 1 \u2212 i ),\n\n(16)\n\nwhere K denotes the operation of the complex-conjugation of numbers.\nComparing Eqs. (12) and (15) one immediately sees that the latter is a\nparticular case of the former, hence C\u03c3 is an involutory symmetry of H .\nThe antilinear operator T satisfies the following remarkable conditions:\nT = T \u2020 and T H \u2020 T \u22121 = H.\nMoreover T generalizes the time-reversal operator introduced in [4]; indeed,\nwhenever H is diagonalizable with a non degenerate spectrum, the operator in\n6\n\n\fEq. (16) coincides with the inverse of the generalized time-reversal operator\nintroduced in [4] . Besides, whenever H is Hermitian, the generalized timereversal operator T defined in Eq.(16) satisfies the following properties: (i) T\nis antiunitary; (ii) T commutes with H; (iii) T 2 = 1; (iv) the T symmetry is\nnot spontaneously broken. Hence our generalized time-reversal operator has the\nsame formal properties as the generalized time-reversal operator introduced in\n[3].\nBy using P\u03c3 , T and C\u03c3 , two (families of) involutory antilinear symmetries\nT P\u03c3 and C\u03c3 T P\u03c3\u2032 of H can be constructed:\n\nT P\u03c3\n\n=\n\ndn0 pn0 ,a\nXX\nX\n\n\u03c3 an0 |\u03c8 n0 , a, iiK \u03c6n0 , a, i +\n\nn0 a=1 i=1\nd\n\np\n\nn+ n+ ,a\nX X\nX\n\nn+ ,n\u2212 a=1 i=1\n\nE D\n\u03c3 an+ ( \u03c8 n+ , a, i K \u03c6n\u2212 , a, i +\n\nE D\n\u03c8 n\u2212 , a, i K \u03c6n+ , a, i ),\n\n(17)\n\nand\n\nC\u03c3 T P\u03c3\u2032\n\n=\n\ndn0 pn0 ,a\nX\nXX\nn0 a=1 i=1\nd\n\na\n\u03c3 \u2032a\nn0 \u03c3 n0 |\u03c8 n0 , a, iiK \u03c6n0 , a, i +\n\np\n\nn+ n+ ,a\nX\nX X\n\nn+ ,n\u2212 a=1 i=1\n\nE D\na\n\u03c3 \u2032a\nn+ \u03c3 n+ ( \u03c8 n+ , a, i K \u03c6n\u2212 , a, i +\n\nE\n\u03c8 n\u2212 , a, i K \u03c6n+ , a, i ).\n\n(18)\n\nBy a direct inspection from Eqs.

Let H be an operator with discrete spectrum. Then, there\nexists a definite operator \u03b7 such that H is \u03b7-pseudo-Hermitian if and only if H\nis diagonalizable with real spectrum .\nAccording to such theorem, for any diagonalizable operator H with real\nspectrum, such a positive definite operator can be built up by means of the\nvectors of the biorthonormal basis associated with H. Now, it is worth while\nobserving that such operator coincides with the product P+ of a suitable couple\nof generalized parity and charge-conjugation operators:\nP+ = P\u03c3 C\u03c3 =\n\ndn0\nXX\n\nn0 a=1\n\n|\u03c6n0 , ai \u03c6n0 , a\n\n(23)\n\n(note that the same (arbitrary) sequence of signs must be chosen both in P\u03c3\nand in C\u03c3 ).\nLet us conclude this section by some further remarks about the connection between the pseudo-Hermiticity property and the time-reversal symmetry.\nIt was already known [13][14] that for any diagonalizable Hamiltonian H an\nantilinear (involutory) operator exists which commutes with H if and only if\nH is pseudo-Hermitian. This result has been recently generalized to the nondiagonalizable case [11], and the discussion above confirms it (see in particular\nEq. (21)). This allows one to conclude that any time-reversal invariant (not\nnecessarily diagonalizable) Hamiltonian must belong to the class of pseudoHermitian Hamiltonians.\nThe converse does not hold in general. Indeed, one can prove that an antilinear involutory symmetry is associated to any pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian,\nbut in general one cannot interpret it as the \"physical \" time-reversal operator\n\u0398; for instance, in the case of fermionic systems it is well known that\n\u03982 = \u22121,\nand the above results do not ensure the existence of such a symmetry. In order\nto go more deeply into the matter, we recall that the following theorem holds\n[11]:\nTheorem 2. Let H be a linear operator with a discrete spectrum. Then, the\nfollowing conditions are equivalent:\ni) an antilinear operator T exists such that [H, T] = 0 , with T2 = \u22121;\nii) H is pseudo-Hermitian and the Jordan blocks associated with any real\neigenvalue occur in pair.\nFrom this theorem it follows in particular that whenever a pseudo-Hermitian\noperator H admits an antilinear symmetry T with T2 = \u22121, both the geometric\nand the algebraic multiplicities of any real eigenvalue of H are even.\n.\n\n8\n\n\f4\n\nP -pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians and indefinite inner products\n\nA very intriguing feature of the pseudo-Hermiticity property is the chance of\nslightly generalizing the usual quantum-mechanical description of a physical\nsystem, by adopting a more general criterion for the representation of physical\nobservables.\nIndeed, as it is well known, when one considers a \u03b7-pseudo-Hermitian operator H a new (possibly, but not necessarily) indefinite inner product can be\ndefined in the Hilbert space H [15]:\nhh\u03c8, \u03c6ii\u03b7 := h\u03c8| \u03b7 |\u03c6i ,\n\n(24)\n\nwith respect to which H is self-adjoint, in the sense that H \u2021 := \u03b7 \u22121 H \u2020 \u03b7 = H ,\nhence hhH\u03c8, \u03c6ii\u03b7 = hh\u03c8, H\u03c6ii\u03b7 .\nLet us then consider the orthogonal projectors \u03a0(\u00b1) mapping H on the spans\nof the eigenvectors of \u03b7 associated with its positive, or respectively negative,\neigenvalues and observe that, being \u03b7 invertible, none of its eigenvalues vanishes.\nHence, trivially,\n\u03a0(+) + \u03a0(\u2212) = 1,\nand\n\nH = H(+) \u2295 H(\u2212) ,\n\nwhere H(\u00b1) \u2261 \u03a0(\u00b1) H . Moreover, it is easily seen that, for all vectors |\u03c7\u00b1 i \u2208\nH(\u00b1) , the real number \u00b1 hh\u03c7\u00b1 , \u03c7\u00b1 ii\u03b7 is positive, and that H(\u00b1) are Hilbert\n1\nspaces relative to the norms k\u03c7\u00b1 k = (\u00b1 hh\u03c7\u00b1 , \u03c7\u00b1 ii\u03b7 ) 2 , so that the space H,\nendowed with the metric hh*, *ii\u03b7 , is a Krein space [16] [17].\nThe Krein construction is particularly suitable in order to describe physical\nsystems associated with pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Indeed, if the Hamiltonian operator H, which determines the time dependence of the state vector\n|\u03c8i according to the Schrodinger equation\nd\n|\u03c8i = H |\u03c8i ,\ndt\nis \u03b7-pseudo-Hermitian, the conservation of the normalization of the state vectors\nwith time still holds in a Krein space, where the new inner product is used [15].\nMore generally, it must be emphasized that none of the requirements for\na proper quantum-mechanical interpretation are violated as long as pseudoHermitian Hamiltonians and, at the same time, a new positive definite inner\nproduct are employed [18] (see also the following Sec. 6 for some concrete examples).\nNow, if we perform a linear (not necessarily unitary) transformation of the\ncoordinate system in the Krein space H introduced above [19]:\nE\ne = S \u22121 |\u03c8i\n\u03c8\ni\n\n9\n\n\fwe have to put\ne\n\u03b7 = S \u2020 \u03b7S\n\n(25)\n\ne\u2021 = e\ne\u2020 e\nA\n\u03b7 \u22121 A\n\u03b7 = S \u22121 A\u2021 S\n\n(26)\n\nin order to keep the length of the vector in H constant; \u03b7\u0303 is said to be congruent\nto \u03b7. (In particular, note that whenever \u03b7 is a positive definite operator, for\ninstance \u03b7 \u2261 P+ (see Eq. (23)), a transformation exists such that P\u0303+ = 1.\nHence, if we restrict H to be diagonalizable with real spectrum, we can conclude\nthat pseudo-Hermiticity is equivalent to Hermiticity [20].)\nThe observables such as A and their adjoints are then transformed according\nto\ne = S \u22121 AS,\nA\n\nin order to make their expectation values invariant [19]:\nD\nE\ne e\ne \u03c8\ne .\nhAi\u03b7 = h\u03c8| \u03b7A |\u03c8i = \u03c8\n\u03b7A\n\nLet us consider now a P\u03c3 -pseudo-Hermitian operator H , where P\u03c3 is given\nin Eq.(14), and let us fix in H the (indefinite) inner product induced by P\u03c3 .\nGiven any complete orthonormal basis F = {|un , a, ii}(that we denote by\nthe same labels n, a, i used for the elements of E ), let us pose\n\nS=\n\nn,a\ndn p\nX\nXX\n\nn a=1 i=1\n\n|\u03c8 n , a, ii hun , a, i|\n\n( hence, S \u22121 =\n\nn,a\ndn p\nX\nXX\n\nn a=1 i=1\n\n|un , a, ii h\u03c6n , a, i|).\n(27)\n\nPerforming such a transformation one obtains, according to Eq.

It is easily verified that T rP\nple Jordan blocks Ja (En0 ) of odd dimension associated with the real eigenvalues\nappearing in the Jordan canonical form of H\u0303.

Henceforth\nwe will usually refer to such a \u03c3, and we will just denote the generalized parity\nand charge-conjugation operators by P and C for the sake of simplicity.\n\n5\n\nIndefinite inner product spaces and symmetries of H\n\nThe arguments in the preceding section led us in a natural way to discuss the\nproperties of indefinite inner product spaces. In this section we go on to the\nsymmetries of these spaces, where the scalar product is defined as in Eq. (24);\nmoreover, since Eq. (1) holds with any P\u03c3 in place of \u03b7, considering the peculiar properties of the generalized parity operators (see for instance Eqs. (21)\nand (22)), and remembering the remark at the end of preceding section, we will\nalways put P instead of \u03b7 in (24). Furthermore, we will investigate the connections between these symmetries and the previously obtained involutory C, T P\nand CT P symmetries of H .\nThe set S of the symmetries in indefinite metric spaces (that is the transformations preserving the modulus of the indefinite scalar product) was investigated in [9], where a generalized Wigner's Theorem was proven, and the\nfollowing fourfold classification was obtained:\n1) An operator U such that\nh\u03c8| U \u2020 P U |\u03c6i = h\u03c8| P |\u03c6i\n\n(33)\n\nis called a P -unitary operator in the indefinite metric space.\n2) An operator V such that\nh\u03c8| V \u2020 P V |\u03c6i = h\u03c6| P |\u03c8i\nis called a P -antiunitary operator in the indefinite metric space.\n12\n\n(34)\n\n\f3) An operator U such that\nh\u03c8| U \u2020 P U |\u03c6i = \u2212 h\u03c8| P |\u03c6i\n\n(35)\n\nis called a P -pseudounitary operator in the indefinite metric space.\n4) An operator V such that\nh\u03c8| V \u2020 P V |\u03c6i = \u2212 h\u03c6| P |\u03c8i\n\n(36)\n\nis called a P -pseudoantiunitary operator in the indefinite metric space.\nFurther, we recall that the spectral properties of P -unitary operators were\nalready investigated in [8].\nLet us then focus our attention on a relevant subset of SH \u2282 S, that is\nthe set of all the invertible P -unitary, P -antiunitary, P -pseudounitary and P pseudoantiunitary operators S which commute with H:\nSH = {X \u2208 S : [H, X] = 0} .\nFirst of all, with regard to the P -unitary symmetries U of SH , we observe\nthat all of them can be explicitly obtained by considering the linear operators X\nbelonging to the commutant of H [22] and then imposing the constraints (33).\nBy a simple calculation one easily recognizes that the operator C\u03c3 given in Eq.\n(15) is a P -unitary operator.\nLet us come now to the P -antiunitary, P -pseudounitary and P -pseudoantiunitary\nsymmetry operators. We have already seen that an involutory metric Pe can always be obtained by a suitable transformation S (see Eqs.(27) and (25)), and\nthis can be done without spoiling the assumptions of the generalized Wigner's\nTheorem [9]. Hence, all the (P -unitary,) P -antiunitary, P -pseudounitary and\nP -pseudoantiunitary symmetry operators (whenever they exist) are in a one-toone correspondence with the (P\u0303 -unitary,) Pe -antiunitary, Pe -pseudounitary and\nPe -pseudoantiunitary symmetries respectively.\nRecalling the peculiar properties of the antilinear operators T\u0303 P\u0303 and C\u0303 T\u0303 P\u0303\n(namely, they are Hermitian, involutory operators which commute with P\u0303 ), and\ncoming back to the basis E, in virtue of the above correspondence, the following\nProposition easily follows, which paraphrases a similar statement in [9]:\nProposition 3. Any P -antiunitary symmetry operator V \u2208 S can be written as follows:\nV = (CT P )U = (T P )U \u2032\nwhere U and U \u2032 represent P -unitary symmetries of H and CT P and T P are\nthe involutory operators given in Eqs. (18) and (17), respectively.\nIn particular, taking into account Eqs. (21) and (22), one can prove immediately the following Corollary, which allows us to obtain all the P -antiunitary\nelements of SH if the P -unitary ones are known.\nCorollary. Any P -antiunitary symmetry operator V \u2208 SH can be written\nas follows:\n\n13\n\n\fV = (CT P )U = (T P )U \u2032\nwhere U and U \u2032 represent P -unitary symmetries of H and CT P and T P are\nthe involutory operators given in Eqs. (18) and (17), respectively.\nAs to Pe-pseudounitary and Pe-pseudoantiunitary operators, they may exist\nonly in indefinite metric spaces in which the eigenvalues +1 and -1 of the metric\noperator Pe have the same multiplicity [9] (i.e., T rPe = 0).\nHence, from now on we limit ourselves to consider even dimensional spaces\nand we choose in {P\u03c3 } a P which is congruent to a traceless, involutory operator P\u0303 (see the remark in Sec. 4). Then, it is not difficult to see that any\nP -pseudounitary operator can be obtained multiplying the P -unitary ones by\nan involutory operator R (also called P -reflecting operator ) which satisfies the\nfollowing condition:\nR\u2020 P R = \u2212P ,\nand a similar statement holds for P -pseudoantiunitary operators.\nIn this connection, the following proposition provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a P -pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian H to admit P -pseudounitary\nand P -pseudoantiunitary symmetries.\nProposition 4. Let H be a P -pseudo-Hermitian operator with a discrete\nspectrum, where P is congruent to a traceless, involutory operator. Then the\nfollowing conditions are equivalent:\ni) the Jordan blocks associated with any real eigenvalue of H occur in pairs;\nii) an involutory operator R exists such that [H, R] = 0 and R\u2020 P R = \u2212P ;\niii) an antilinear operator T exists such that [H, T] = 0 and T2 = \u22121.\nProof.

Then, we observe that, since\ne R]\ne = 0 , the matrix elements of R\u0303 between states belonging to two different\n[H,\nspaces En and En\u2032 are always zero[22], hence R\u0303 maps each En into itself.\nNow, let us consider a vector space En0 associated with a real eigenvalue\nEn0 , and let us pick out in it the subspace spanned by the set {|un0 , a, ii , i =\ne |un0 , a, 1i is again\n1, ...pn0 ,a }, with a fixed a. One immediately realizes that R\ne\nan eigenvector of H, corresponding to the same eigenvalue; furthermore, the\nvectors {R\u0303 |un0 , a, ii , i = 1, ...pn0 ,a } belong to En0 and they are easily seen to\nbe linearly independent.

It is worth while stressing that in the case under consideration the\neigenvalues of U (t) are ei\u03b1 and ei\u03b2 (see (41)), hence, they are unimodular .

Indeed, we considered\nin Sec. 4 all the symmetries of the Krein space that one can associate with a P pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian H. They include P -antiunitary and (possibly)\nP -pseudounitary and P -pseudoantiunitary symmetries, besides the P -unitary\nones which have been already introduced [7], [8]. Then, in this connection, we\nhave proven that any P -pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian H admits P -antiunitary\nsymmetries and the generators T P and CT P of such symmetries are explicitly\nshown in Eqs. (17) and (18) respectively. Moreover, T P and CT P also generates\nall the P -antiunitary symmetries of the space H.\n20\n\n\fFurthermore, if a P -reflecting operator R which commutes with H exists\nin the Krein space, RT P generates all the P -pseudoantiunitary symmetries of\nthe Hamiltonian. In particular, Proposition 4 provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of P -pseudounitary and P -pseudoantiunitary\nsymmetries of H, and their generators R and RT P are given in Eqs. (37) and\n(40) respectively. We stress here that RT P coincides with the antilinear operator T which has the same properties as the time-reversal operator of fermionic\nsystems (see the discussion at the end of Sec. 3), so that Proposition 4 links\nin a perhaps unexpected way the existence of a time-reversal symmetry of H\nand of a P -reflecting symmetry of the Krein space. We remark however that\nProposition 4 does not apply whenever a positive definite operator (e.g., P+ ) is\nchosen to define the new inner product (24).\nFinally, some hints arose when these concepts have been applied to the\nstudy of a physical system (the Mashhoon-Papini Hamiltonian), in particular\nregarding the non unitary evolution of such system.\nWe recall that Krein spaces have been already introduced in connection with\npseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians, in the attempt of enlarging the framework of\nQuantum Mechanics, and several interpretation of the vectors in H(\u2212) have been\nproposed [1] [25]. We believe that this paper fits very well in this attempt, in\nthat it allows one to extend the description above to the nondiagonalizable case,\nand to deeper understand the symmetry properties of such spaces.\n\nReferences\n[1] C.
