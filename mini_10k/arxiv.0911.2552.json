We will present the\nfindings of these studies and discuss the connection to the formation and evolution of NGC 5128.\nKeywords: galaxies: elliptical and lenticular, cD - galaxies: evolution - galaxies: individual (NGC\n5128) galaxies: star clusters - globular clusters: general\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\ntain numerous GC spectra in a homogeneous manner,\nproviding large sample sizes.\n\nGlobular clusters (GCs) survive for a Hubble time and\nundergo dissipationless dynamical evolution. They have\nbeen shown to form during major episodes of star formation (Holtzman et al., 1992; Schweizer & Seitzer, 1993;\nWhitmore et al., 1993; Whitmore & Schweizer, 1995;\nZepf et al., 1995; Schweizer et al., 1996; Miller et al.,\n1997; Carlson et al., 1998; Schweizer & Seitzer, 1998;\nWhitmore et al., 1999; Zepf et al., 1999; Chien et al.,\n2007; Goudfrooij et al., 2007; Trancho et al., 2007, among\nothers). This enables the use of GCs as probes of the\nformation history in their host galaxy which can tell\nus important information on the galaxy's assembly history and the physical conditions in which the GCs were\nformed. We can use their ages and metallicities to\nreconstruct the star formation history of their galaxy\n(West et al., 2004) as well as use the GCs as kinematic\nand dynamic tracers (Bridges et al., 2006).\nThere are many advantages in using GCs as probes\nof star formation and galaxy assembly. GCs are coeval\nand form with a single age and a single metallicity to\nfirst approximation. We also find large GC systems in\nearly-type galaxies, providing a large basis for study.\nGC systems have been shown to exhibit two colour\nmodes, both blue and red (Peng et al., 2006), indicating there could have been at least two episodes of star\nformation within these galaxies. Since the large majority of the colour change of the GC light that we\nsee happens within the first few Gyr (Worthey et al.,\n1994), any subsequent colour difference is due to a difference in metallicity, so we refer to blue as metalpoor and red as metal-rich GCs. The advancements\nof multi-object spectrographs have allowed us to ob-\n\n1\n\n1.1\n\nThe Globular Cluster System of\nNGC 5128\n\nNGC 5128 is the nearest available giant elliptical for\nstudy at 3.8 \u00b1 0.1 Mpc (G.L.H Harris, 2009, private\ncommunication). Its close proximity provides the opportunity to perform a detailed study of its GC system\nat a level of detail that is not possible in other giant\nellipticals at present. We will use the GCs as representations of the bulk stellar population to probe its\nformation history.\nIn NGC 5128, there are an estimated 1500 GCs\nwithin 25 arcmin (Harris et al., 2006). We currently\nknow of 70 GCs within NGC 5128 that have been identified as resolved GCs from Hubble Space Telescope images (Harris et al., 2006). There are 564 GCs also confirmed by radial velocity measurement (van den Bergh et al.,\n1981; Hesser et al., 1984, 1986; Harris et al., 1992; Peng et al.,\n2004b; Woodley et al., 2005; Rejkuba et al., 2007; Beasley et al.,\n2008), including 190 new GCs our group has recently\nidentified (Woodley et al., 2009a,b). The sample now\nincludes 605 GCs which is one of the largest samples\nof GCs in the literature. Of the total GC system with\nknown photometry, we have identified 268 metal-poor\nand 271 metal-rich GCs, with a clear bimodal distribution in colour. Figure 1 shows the projected spatial\ndistribution of the GC system which extends out to\n45 arcmin in galactocentric radius, distributed mainly\nalong the isophotal major axis of the galaxy and heavily concentrated within 15 arcmin. Our sample is thus\nspatially biased, caused primarily by the chosen field\n\n\f2\n\nPublications of the Astronomical Society of Australia\n\nlocations of previous studies.\n\nstellar population model grids of Thomas et al. (2003)\nand Thomas et al. (2004) to obtain ages, metallicities,\nand alpha-to-iron abundance ratios,[\u03b1/Fe], of the GCs.\nWe have performed the same analysis with integrated\nlight spectra of 40 Milky Way GCs from Schiavon et al.\n(2005) and 1 Milky Way GC from Puzia et al. (2002).\nWe calibrated the Milky Way GC to the Lick system\nvia 11 GCs in common with Puzia et al. (2002), who\nhave calibrated their data to the Lick index system\nwith standard stars. The uncertainties in our measured indices are determined using GONZO by adding\nPoisson noise to each input GC spectra via 100 Montecarlo simulations. The uncertainty on each index is\nthe 1\u03c3 standard deviation of the index measurement.\nThe list of indices with uncertainties, as well as the\nvarious calibration plots are shown in Woodley et al.\n(2009a).\n\n2.2\n\nFigure 1: The galactocentric radial distribution of\nGCs in NGC 5128 as function of azimuthal position, measured in degrees E of N. The squares\nand the triangles are the metal-poor and metalrich GCs with a measured velocity, respectively,\nand the solid circles are GCs that either have measured velocities but no colour information, or GCs\nwith no measured radial velocities.\n\n2\n\n2.1\n\nSpectroscopic Results and Discussion\n\nWe show an example of one diagnostic plot in Figure 2. Here we have shown the GC indices for both\n\nThe Ages, Metallicities, and\nAlpha-Enhancement of the\nGlobular Clusters\nIndex Measurement\n\nTo obtain ages and metallicities of the GCs in NGC\n5128, we need to obtain high signal-to-noise (S/N)\nspectroscopy to measure the strength of particular absorption features. In NGC 5128, we have obtained integrated light spectra of GCs with Gemini-S/GMOS.\nOur field placements are centrally concentrated within\n15 arcmin, but distributed azimuthally. We obtained\nspectra for 72 GCs with S/N> 30/\u00c5 covering the wavelength regime of 3800 \u2212 5500\u00c5. The measured indices\ninclude the Balmer lines, as well as Mg, CN, and many\nFe lines. The data reduction details are described in\nWoodley et al. (2009a).\nWe measured the indices using GONZO (Puzia et al.,\n2002) and calibrated the data to the Lick index system (described in Burstein et al., 1984; Worthey et al.,\n1994; Worthey & Ottaviani, 1997; Trager et al., 1998),\na standardized index system. We had between 9\u201316\nGCs in common with Beasley et al. (2008) who had\ndirectly calibrated their data to the Lick index system\nvia standard stars. With Lick indices in hand, we iterated between our measured indices and the simple\n\nFigure 2: The measured indices for 72 GCs in NGC\n5128 (red circles) and 41 GCs in the Milky Way\n(blue squares) shown for H\u03b4F and [MgFe]\u2032.

To\nobtain age, metallicity, and [\u03b1/Fe] for the GCs, we use\n1 [MgFe]\u2032\n\np\n\nMgb \u00d7 (0.72 \u00d7 Fe5270 + 0.28 \u00d7 Fe5335)\n=\n(Thomas et al., 2003)\n\n\f3\n\nwww.publish.csiro.au/journals/pasa\n\nan iteration technique incorporating a number of diagnostic plots, including the Balmer lines, Mg2 , Mgb ,\nFe5270, and Fe5335 with varying [\u03b1/Fe] (described in\nfull in Puzia et al., 2002). Our results are presented in\nFigure 3. The histrograms have been fit with Gaussian\ndistributions using the statistical code RMIX 2 .\nWe clearly see a difference in the age distribution\nfunctions between the GCs in NGC 5128 and those\nin the Milky Way. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical\ncomparison test indicates these two distributions are\ndifferent at greater than a 99% confidence level. There\nappears to be multiple epochs for the formation history\nin NGC 5128. An important test of our technique\nis the ability to reproduce the known old ages of the\nMilky Way GCs. We have obtained a mean age of\n11.3 \u00b1 0.1 Gyr for the Milky Way GCs, in excellent\nagreement with the known old ages of the Milky Way\nGCs. We have confidence therefore in our own results\nfor the GCs in NGC 5128. We find, in NGC 5128, 68%\nof our GC sample have old ages greater than 8 Gyr,\n14% have intermediate ages between 5-8 Gyr, and 18%\nhave young ages less than 5 Gyr.\n\nBeasley et al., 2008). We are also more likely to target younger objects, which are brighter than their older\ncounterparts, to achieve the require S/N. We also have\na bias towards a larger range of ages than perhaps the\nouter halo, due to accreted material sinking towards\nthe central regions. Our proportion of young, metalrich GCs is therefore, likely inflated. We find that\nthat 92% (23/25) of metal-poor GCs and 56% (26/47)\nof metal-rich GCs that we have sampled in NGC 5128\nhave ages > 8 Gyr, consistent with the old ages of the\nMilky Way GCs. We do however find all younger GCs\nare metal-rich, with the exception of 2 metal-poor GC\nwith an intermediate age.\nLastly, we obtain the abundance of \u03b1-to-Fe type\nelements. This ratio can indicate the timescale of GC\nformation. Supernovae type II events occur over a\ntimescale of \u223c 100 Myr and enrich the interstellar\nmedium with primarily \u03b1-type elements. The onset of\nsupernova type Ia events, which enriches the interstellar medium with a larger fraction of Fe-type elements\nafter 1 Gyr, will reduce the value of [\u03b1/Fe]. In NGC\n5128, we find a spread in [\u03b1/Fe] at every given metallicity and a wider spread among the older GCs. The\nmean [\u03b1/Fe] for the GCs in NGC 5128 is 0.14\u00b10.04 dex\nwhich indicates a fast formation timescale, likely forming in a rapid cloud collapse, as opposed to a merger\nevent, which would enrich the GCs to solar [\u03b1/Fe].\n\n3\n\nThe Kinematics of the Globular Cluster System\n\nThe bimodality of the GC system suggests there may\nbe multiple epochs of star formation. This could also\nlead to different kinematic signatures between the metalrich and metal-poor GCs. We explore the kinematics\nsignature of the 564 GCs with radial velocity measurements by fitting the standard sine curve fit to the data,\nvp (\u0398) = vsys + \u03a9Rsin(\u0398 \u2212 \u0398o )\n\nFigure 3: The age (top), metallicity (middle), and\n[\u03b1/Fe] (bottom) distributions for the GCs in NGC\n5128 (left) and the Milky Way (right). The best\nfit Gaussians are plotted. This figure has been\nmodified from Woodley et al. (2009a).\nThe metallicity distribution, determined using spectroscopic indices with the simple stellar population\nmodels, provides a distribution that is not clearly bimodal, as seen in the Milky Way. Our sample size is\nquite small and is heavily biased towards metal-rich as\nwell as younger GCs because we are specifically targetting the central region of NGC 5128. In this region, the\nmetal-rich population is more strongly concentrated\nthan the metal-poor (see Woodley et al., 2005, 2007;\n2 The complete code, available for a variety of platforms,\nis publicly available from Peter MacDonald's Web site at\nhttp://www.math.mcmaster.ca/peter/mix/mix.html.\n\n(1)\n\ndescribed in C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al. (2001). Our input values are\nthe measured radial velocity, vp , and the angular position of each GC measured on the projected sky in degrees East of North, \u0398. The radial velocities and associated uncertainties used in this study are the weighted\naverages of all previous measurements in the literature.\nWe extract the systemic velocity, vsys , the rotation amplitude, \u03a9R, and the projected rotation axis, \u0398o , also\nmeasured in degrees East of North in the projected\nsky, with a weighted least squares non-linear fit.\nWe bin the data in two ways. The first binning\nmethod is by radial position in the galaxy so the bins\nare independent and plotted at the mean radial value\nof all GCs in that bin. The second binning method is\nan exponentially weighted binning technique described\nin Bergond et al. (2006).\n\n3.1\n\nKinematic Results\n\nWhile we present only selected results here, the full results can be found in Woodley et al. (2009b). Table 1\nlists the vsys , \u03a9R, \u0398o , and the velocity dispersion, \u03c3vp ,\n\n\f4\n\nPublications of the Astronomical Society of Australia\n\nfor the metal-rich and metal-poor GC samples determined with Equation 1.\n\nrotation axis of the metal-rich GCs does rotate around\nan axis near the isophotal major axis, at least within\nthe inner 10 arcmin of the galaxy. We also examine\nthe kinematics for the age subsamples determined in\nSection 2, and are summarized in Table 2. We note\nthe rotation axis of the metal-rich GCs with ages < 5\nGyr, do not rotate around a similar axis as the bulk\nof old, metal-rich GCs. The uncertainties are quite\nlarge because of the small number of young GCs in our\nsample (N=13), but it could indicate the kinematics\namong the youngest GCs are different than the bulk\nof the GC system. A larger sample of GC ages are\nneeded to examine this more closely.\n\nTable 1: Kinematics of the GC System\nMetal-Rich Metal-Poor\nvsys (km s\u22121 )\n\u03a9R(km s\u22121 )\n\u0398o (deg E of N)\n\u03c3vp (km s\u22121 )\n\n527 \u00b1 10\n41 \u00b1 15\n191 \u00b1 18\n150 \u00b1 3\n\n504 \u00b1 10\n17 \u00b1 14\n154 \u00b1 47\n149 \u00b1 3\n\nWe clearly see, as a whole, the GC system is not\nstrongly rotating and is thus supported by random\nmotion. The metal-rich GCs appear to have mild rotation around an axis similar to the isophotal major\naxis of the galaxy, located at 35 and 215 deg E of N\n(Dufour et al., 1979) in the inner 15 arcmin. However, the metal-poor GCs with very mild rotation, do\nnot appear to rotate around either the major or minor isophotal axis. The velocity dispersion is also determined for both the metal-rich and metal-poor GC\nsubpopulations, and are identical within uncertainties.\nThis is also seen in the GC system of the elliptical NGC\n4636 (Schuberth et al., 2006).\nWe examine the metal-rich GC population rotation\naxis more closely by binning the data in independent\ngalactocentric bins as well as by an exponential fitting,\nshown in Figure 4. For the metal-rich GCs, the bin\nwidths are 0-5, 5-10, 10-15, and 15-45 arcmin.

In this plot, the radial bins are 0-5, 5-10, 1015, 15-20, and 20-45 arcmin for the entire GC system.\nThe velocity dispersion appears flat within the inner\n15 arcmin, after which it shows an increase. Although\nnot shown in Figure 5, we note a similar velocity dispersion profile for both the metal-rich GC and metalpoor GC subpopulations separately (Woodley et al.,\n2009b). This is also the onset of the spatial biases\nwithin the GC system and needs to be examined more\nclosely with a larger, more azimuthally symmetric sample of GCs. With this caveat aside, an increasing velocity dispersion in the outer regions could be interpreted as the galaxy containing a large amount of dark\nmatter or the GCs moving on anisotropic orbits. In\nNGC 5128 it is difficult to analyze the orbital motion\nof the GCs without modelling and/or without an external mass estimate extending to these outer regions.\nSimilar findings have been noted in M87 (C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al.,\n2001), as well as hints for an increase in the velocity\ndispersion of the GCs in the elliptical galaxies NGC\n3379 (Pierce et al., 2006) and M49 (C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 2003).\n\n3.2\n\nFigure 4: The rotation axis as a function of galactocentric radius for the metal-rich GCs binned radially (circles) and exponentially (curve), and for\nthe PNe (triangles).

There is\na sample of 780 PNe in NGC 5128 (Hui et al., 1995;\nPeng et al., 2004a) extending out to \u223c 80 arcmin from\nthe centre of the galaxy, strongly concentrated along\nthe well search isophotal major axis. We determine\nthe rotation axis of the PNe and show its profile distribution binned radially in Figure 4. Similar to the\nmetal-rich GCs, it rotates around an axis near the\nisophotal major axis. We compare the PNe velocity\n\n\f5\n\nwww.publish.csiro.au/journals/pasa\n\n3.3\n\nMass and Mass-to-Light of NGC\n5128\n\nGCs can also be used to trace the mass of its host\ngalaxy. Using our sample of 564 GCs with radial velocity measurements, we use GCs as tracer particles to\ndetermine a total mass of the galaxy. The total mass is\ncomprised of rotationally supported mass added to the\npressure supported mass. We determine the rotational\ncomponent of the mass with the spherical Jeans equation and the pressure supported mass with the Tracer\nMass Estimator (Evans et al., 2003).\nUsing the GCs that reside in the least spatially\nbiased regime (between 5\u201320 arcmin), we estimate a\nmass of NGC 5128 of 5.5 \u00b1 1.9 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 and a massto-light ratio of 15.35 M\u2299 /LB\u2299 (assuming B=7.84 for\nNGC 5128 Karachentsev et al., 2002) out to 20 arcmin.\nThis mass estimate agrees quite well with other recent\nwork (Schiminovish et al., 1994; Peng et al., 2004b; Woodley et al.,\n2007).\n\nFigure 5: The velocity dispersion as a function\nof galactocentric radius for the entire GC system\nbinned radially (circles) and exponentially (curve),\nand for the PNe (triangles). We also show the\nresults for the entire GC system (circle with x).\n\ndispersion to that of the GC system in Figure 5 and\nsee a difference between the two systems. The bin\nsizes for the PNe data are 0-5, 5-10, 10-15, 15-20, 2025, and 25-80 arcmin. The PNe profile appears to\ndecrease, then flatten near 10\u201315 arcmin, and then decrease out to beyond 30 arcmin, where the GC velocity\ndispersion appears to increase. The decrease in velocity dispersion of the planetary nebuale could indicate\nthat the PNe are on anisotropic orbits. This behaviour\nhas been seen in simulations of merging galaxies (for\ne.g. Dekel et al., 2005) where the PNe get thrown off\ntheir orbits from the disks of their progenitor galaxies into the halo of the merger remnant. We also note\nthat the metal-rich GCs and the PNe have very similar surface density profiles, with slopes of 3.56 \u00b1 0.21\nand 3.47 \u00b1 0.12 respectively, analyzed between 5\u201320\narcmin, where we are most spatially secure with both\nsample populations. Further comparison with metallicity distribution of the stellar halo population generated from Hubble Space Telescope data (Rejkuba et al.,\n2005, and references therein), shows a similar enrichment to the metal-rich GCs. This is shown graphically in Woodley et al. (2009a). Rejkuba et al. (2005)\nalso estimate an age for the stellar halo population of\n\u223c 8+3\n\u22123.5 Gyr, indicating the stellar population, along\nwith the results shown here for the metal-rich GCs, are\nold. These increasing similarities between the metalrich GCs and the stellar halo population could indicate that they formed contemporaneously. However,\nwe cautiously note the velocity dispersion profiles appear to differ between the metal-rich GCs and the PNe.\n\n3.4\n\nKinematic Discussion\n\nFor the large GC kinematic analysis presented in the\nliterature, there is a wide range of results. There are\nno clear patterns among the giant ellipticals in the\nVirgo cluster of galaxies, M60 (Bridges et al., 2006;\nHwang et al., 2008), M87 (C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 2001), M49 (C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al.,\n2003), and NGC 4636 (Schuberth et al., 2006), as well\nas no clear patterns between the giant elliptical galaxies near the dynamical centres of their cluster of galaxies, M87 (C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 2001) and NGC 1399 (Richtler et al.,\n2004), or the brightest ellipticals in their host cluster of galaxies M49 (C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 2003) and NGC 1399\n(Richtler et al., 2004).\nBekki et al. (2005) have numerically simulated the\nkinematic signatures of preexisting metal-rich and metalpoor GCs from the merging of galaxies like our Milky\nWay. While their simulations were dissipationless, we\nare interested in comparing their kinematic predictions to our findings, since the bulk of the GC population in NGC 5128 is old. In their simulations, they\nfound increasing rotational signatures with increasing\ngalactocentric radius from the merger, due to transfer to angular momentum into the outer regions of the\nremnant. We have analyzed the rotation amplitude\nof NGC 5128 for both the metal-rich and metal-poor\nGCs separately, and do not see a strong indication for\nincreasing rotation with radius. The simulations of\nBekki et al. (2005) also show the velocity dispersion\nfor the GCs remained flat or decrease with radius. We\nsee evidence for a flat dispersion out to 15 arcmin from\nthe centre. This comparison indicates that NGC 5128\nmay not be consistent with having formed as the result of the merger of two fully formed disks galaxies,\nalthough this is not ruled out.\nAn important implication from the study of Bekki et al.\n(2005) suggests that the initial kinematic signatures of\nGCs in the progenitor galaxies undergo orbital mixing.\nIt may not be possible to trace the original kinematics of the GCs (Hwang et al., 2008), but only the GC\nkinematics from the most recent major interaction. If\nthis were the case, it would be very difficult to use the\n\n\f6\n\nPublications of the Astronomical Society of Australia\n\ncurrent kinematics of the GCs to trace their orbital\nhistory (Kissler-Patig et al., 1998).\n\nrich (when [Fe/H]\u2265 \u22121.0). When neither C, T1 , U,\nor V information were available, we assigned a GC as\nmetal-rich if (B \u2212 I) \u2265 2.072 and as metal-poor if\n(B \u2212 I) < 2.072 following Peng et al. (2004b).\nFor the purpose of this study, we are interested\nin looking at the sizes of the most representative GCs,\nand so we have removed the GCs that deviate from the\nrest of the population in both ellipticity and half-light\nradii. There are 472 GCs that satisfy the requirements\nof having both ellipticity < 0.4 and rh < 8pc. We\ndisplay the measured rh in Figure 6 as a function of\ngalactocentric radius. The GCs are binned with effec-\n\n4\n\nStructural Parameters of the\nGlobular Clusters\n\nThe structural parameters of GCs can provide insight\ninto how GCs form as well as their environment of\nformation. In particular, we are interested in their\nhalf-light radii, rh . This parameter has been shown to\nremain relatively constant throughout the lifetime of a\nGC (Spitzer & Thuan, 1972; Aarseth et al., 1998). Interestingly, over the last decade, many studies have\nshown that the red GCs are smaller than the blue\nGCs by 17\u201330% in both spiral and elliptical galaxies\n(Kundu & Whitmore, 1998; Kundu et al., 1999; Puzia et al.,\n1999; Larsen et al., 2001a,b; Kundu & Whitmore, 2001;\nBarmby et al., 2002; Jord\u00e1n et al., 2005; Harris, 2009).\nAlmost all of these studies were performed with the\nsmall field of view of the Hubble Space Telescope, mainly\ncentred on the inner regions of their respective galaxies. Spitler et al. (2006) examined the sizes of the GCs\nin the Sombrero galaxy (NGC 4594), using the Hubble\nSpace Telescope, but extending to a few effective radii\nof the galaxy, Ref f . They showed that the red GCs\nwere smaller than blue within the first 2 Ref f . Beyond\nthis distance their mean sizes did not appear to differ.\nOur group has Magellan/IMACS images taken in\n0.45 arcsec seeing that extend out to 40 arcmin in\ngalactocentric radius. With this stunning image, we\ncan measure all GCs with half-light diameters greater\nthan 4 pc (0.22 arcsec). In the Milky Way, this only\nmisses 15% of the GCs.

If the size\ndifference in the inner regions fo the galaxy is real, then\nthis could suggest that metal-rich and metal-poor GCs\nin some extragalactic systems, did not form under the\nsame conditions.\nWe require more homogeneous and large samples\nof GCs in a variety of galaxies in order to better understand what processes in GC formation or formation\nenvironment has on the formation sizes of GCs. Interestingly, the size differences of GCs may have a direct\nrelation to the environment in which they form, allowing the possibility of GCs to probe formation history of\ntheir host galaxy in yet another way. We suggest that\nit is likely the combination of the environment that the\nGCs have formed with a projection effect that may be\nresponsible for the size differences in the inner regions\nof the GCs within NGC 5128.\n\nFigure 7: The distributions of the half-light radii\nfor the blue (right) and red (left) GCs, as a function\nof effective radii in the galaxy. The mean halflight radius in each bin is plotted with uncertainty\n(circles).\n\nthe red GCs appear to be smaller in the inner regions of\ngalaxies. There are a number of possible explanations\nfor this.\nOne explanation suggests it could be caused by\na projection effect (Larsen & Brodie, 2003). In the\nMilky Way, it has been found that the GCs follow a size\n- distance relation, such that the size of a GC is smaller\ntowards the centre of the galaxy (van den Bergh et al.,\n1991). If GC systems in other galaxies follow this same\ntrend, then they suggest that since the MR GCs are\nmore centrally concentrated in most extralactic systems, they would appear in the inner regions to be\nsmaller than the blue GCs. The more centrally concentrated red GCs would lie at smaller galactocentric distances in projection, thus have smaller radii. At larger\ndistances, the projection would have less effect and\nthe trend should dissappear. However, recent work by\nHarris (2009) who studied a large combined sample of\nGCs from massive galaxies out to a few effective radii\nin each galaxy, found the size difference between the\nred and blue GCs persisted at large distances.\nThe different sizes of GCs could be the combined\neffect of mass segregation and metallicity dependent\nstellar lifetimes (Jord\u00e1n et al., 2005). This would yield\na smaller rh for metal-rich GCs, however, you would\nexpect this to be the case at any galactocentric radius.\nThe differences in sizes of blue and red GCs could\nbe caused by the different tidal effects experienced during their formation (Harris, 2009). In the centre of the\ngalaxy, the potential well would be deeper than the\nouter regions, and the GCs may have been forced to\nform smaller in order to survive. This has been supported by recent work of Georgiev et al. (2008, 2009)\nwho measured sizes for the GCs in the Large Mag-\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have studied the GC system in NGC 5128 and\npresented their ages and metallicities, their kinematics, their structural parameters, and we have also used\nthem as tracers to estimate the mass of NGC 5128.\nWe find, using a sample of 72 GCs, that the majority of metal-rich and metal-poor GCs are old with\n68% having ages > 8 Gyr. We do find a small fraction\nwith young ages < 5 Gyr, all of which are metal-rich.\nThese results suggest there could have been a number\nof formation epochs within NGC 5128, which resulted\nin the formation of a small portion of its stellar population.\nUsing over 560 GCs in NGC 5128, we performed a\nkinematic analysis, and find the metal-rich GCs have\na mild rotation of 41 \u00b1 15 km s\u22121 and rotate around\n191 \u00b1 18 deg E of N, similar to the isophotal major\naxis of the galaxy. The metal-rich GCs have very mild\nrotation and do not appear to rotate around either\nisophotal major or minor axis. The velocity dispersion\nprofile of the GCs is generally flat in the inner regions\nof the galaxy. Compared to the stellar halo population,\nwe see a number of similarities to the metal-rich GCs,\nincluding the rotation axis and surface density profile\nof the PNe population, as well as approximate ages and\nmetal enrichment of the stellar halo (Rejkuba et al.,\n2005). We also use the radial velocity measurements\nof the GCs to estimate a mass of NGC 5128 to be\n5.5 \u00b1 1.9 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 and a mass-to-light ratio of 15.35\nM\u2299 /LB\u2299 out to 20 arcmin.\nWe examine the structural parameters of a representative sample of normal GCs in NGC 5128 using\nsuperb IMACS images. We examine their half-light\nradii, and find within 1\u20132 effective radii of the galaxy,\nthe blue GCs are \u223c 30% larger than the red GCs. Beyond this distance, however, the size difference seems\nto disappear. We suggest this may be the result of their\nenvironment of formation, combined with the projection effect.\nThe old ages and kinematics of the GCs within\nNGC 5128 suggests that the majority of GCs, and\npresumably stars, formed early on in a rapid, or per-\n\n\f8\n\nPublications of the Astronomical Society of Australia\n\nhaps multiple, collapse(s). This is supported by the\nold ages of the GCs and high [\u03b1/Fe] for both metalrich and metal-poor GCs. There is evidence for a\nlarge spread in metal-rich ages, indicating either minor\nmerging or accretion of small neighbouring satellites in\nmore recent times. However the fraction of young objects is heavily biased by our selection of targets. The\nyoungest GCs that we find in our sample are a few\nGyrs old.\n\nDufour, R. J., Harvel, C. A., Martins, D.
