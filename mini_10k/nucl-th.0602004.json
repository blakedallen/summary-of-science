But without accurate calculations of the nuclear matrix elements quantitative conclusions about the\nabsolute neutrino masses and mass hierarchies can barely be reached. Despite years\nof effort there is at present a lack of consensus among nuclear theorists how to correctly calculate the nuclear matrix elements, and how to estimate their uncertainty\n(see e.g. [4, 6]). Since an overwhelming majority of published calculations is based\non the Quasiparticle Random Phase Approximation (QRPA) and its modifications,\nit is worthwhile to try to see what causes the sizable spread of the calculated M 0\u03bd\nvalues. Does it reflect some fundamental uncertainty, or is it mostly related to different choices of various adjustable parameters? If the latter is true (and we believe it\nis) can one find and justify an optimal choice that largely removes such unphysical\ndependence?\nIn our recent papers [7, 8] we have shown that by adjusting the most important\nparameter, the strength of the particle-particle force so that the known rate of the\n2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2-decay is correctly reproduced, the dependence of the calculated 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 nuclear\n\u2217 ) On leave of absence from Department of Nuclear Physics, Comenius University, Mlynsk\u00e1\ndolina F1, SK\u2013842 15 Bratislava, Slovakia\n\nCzechoslovak Journal of Physics, Vol. 51 (2001), No. 0\n\nA\n\n1\n\n\fet al.\n\nmatrix elements M 0\u03bd on the things which are not a priori fixed, in particular, the\nnumber of included single particle states, the different realistic representations of\nthe nucleon G-matrix, the axial vector quenching factor etc., is essentially removed.\nThe method has systematically been applied to calculate the nuclear matrix elements M 0\u03bd for most of the nuclei with known experimental 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2-decay rates and\narguments in favor of the chosen calculation method have been given.\nIn this contribution to the MEDEX'05 we briefly review the ideas and the results\nof [7, 8].\n2\n\nDetails of the calculation of 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay matrix elements\n\nProvided that a virtual light Majorana neutrino with the effective mass hm\u03b2\u03b2 i,\nhm\u03b2\u03b2 i =\n\nN\nX\n\n|Uei |2 ei\u03b1i mi , (all mi \u2265 0) ,\n\n(1)\n\ni\n\nis exchanged between the nucleons the half-life of the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay is given by\n1\n0\u03bd\n= G0\u03bd (E0 , Z)|M \u2032 |2 |hm\u03b2\u03b2 i|2 ,\nT1/2\n\n(2)\n0\u03bd\n\nwhere G0\u03bd (E0 , Z) is an accurately calculable phase-space factor, and M \u2032 is the\n0\u03bd\ncorresponding nuclear matrix element. Thus, obviously, any uncertainty in M \u2032\nmakes the value of hm\u03b2\u03b2 i equally uncertain.\nThe elements of the mixing matrix |Uei |2 and the mass-squared differences \u2206m2\ncan be determined in oscillation experiments. If the existence of the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay\nis proved and the value of T1/2 is found, combining the knowledge of |Uei |2 and\n\u2206m2 , a relatively narrow range of absolute neutrino mass scale can be determined,\nin most situations independently of the Majorana phases \u03b1i [3].\nThe nuclear matrix element M \u2032 0\u03bd is defined as\nM\u2032\n\n0\u03bd\n\n=\n\n\u0010 g \u00112\nM 0\u03bd\nA\n0\u03bd\nhf | \u2212 2F + MGT\n+ MT0\u03bd |ii\n1.25\ngA\n\n(3)\n\nwhere |ii, (|f i) are the wave functions of the ground states of the initial (final)\n0\u03bd\nnuclei. The explicit forms of the operators MF0\u03bd , MGT\nand MT0\u03bd are given in Ref. [8,\n0\u03bd\n9]. We note that for gA = 1.25 nuclear matrix element M \u2032 coincides with M 0\u03bd\nof our previous work [7]. This parameterization is chosen so that we could later\nmodify the value of gA and still use the same phase space factor G0\u03bd (E0 , Z) that\n4\ncontains gA\n= (1.25)4 , tabulated e.g. in Ref. [9].\nIn [7, 8] the quasiparticle random phase approximation (QRPA) and its modification, the renormalized QRPA (RQRPA), are used to describe the structure\nof the intermediate nuclear states virtually excited in the double beta decay. We\nstress that in the QRPA and RQRPA one can include essentially unlimited set of\nsingle-particle (s.p.) states, but only a limited subset of configurations (iterations of\n2\n\nA\n\nCzech. J. Phys. 51 (2001)\n\n\f...\n\nthe particle-hole, respectively two-quasiparticle configurations), in contrast to the\nnuclear shell model. On the other hand, within the QRPA it is not obvious how\nmany single particle states one should include. Hence, various authors choose this\ncrucial number basically for reasons of convenience.\nIt is well known that the residual interaction is an effective interaction depending on the size of the s.p. basis. Hence, when the basis is changed, the interaction\nshould be modified as well. For each nucleus in question three single-particle bases\nare chosen in Refs. [7, 8] with the smallest set corresponding to 1h\u0304\u03c9 particle-hole excitations, and the largest to about 4h\u0304\u03c9 excitations. The s.p. energies are calculated\nwith the Coulomb corrected Woods-Saxon potential. The in Ref. [8] calculations\nhave been performed using G-matrix based only on the Bonn-CD nucleon-nucleon\npotential because as it was shown in Ref. [7] a particular choice of the realistic\nresidual two-body interaction potential has almost no impact on the finally calcu0\u03bd\nlated mean value and variance \u03c3 of M \u2032 , with the overwhelming contribution to\n\u03c3 coming from the choice of the single-particle basis size.\nIn QRPA and RQRPA there are three important global parameters renormalizing the bare residual interaction. First, the pairing part of the interaction is multiplied by a factor gpair whose magnitude is adjusted, for both protons and neutrons\nseparately, such that the pairing gaps for the initial and final nuclei are correctly\nreproduced. This is a standard procedure and it is well-known that within the BCS\nmethod the strength of the pairing interaction depends on the size of the s.p. basis.\nSecond, the particle-hole interaction block is renormalized by an overall strength\nparameter gph which is typically adjusted by requiring that the energy of the giant\nGT resonance is correctly reproduced. We find that the calculated energy of the\ngiant GT state is almost independent of the size of the s.p. basis and is well reproduced with gph \u2248 1. Accordingly, we use gph = 1 throughout, without adjustment.\nThird, an very important strength parameter gpp renormalizes the particleparticle interaction (the importance of the particle-particle interaction for the \u03b2\u03b2\ndecay was recognized first in [10]). The decay rate for both modes of \u03b2\u03b2 decay\nis well known to depend sensitively on the value of gpp (in J \u03c0 = 1+ channel the\nsensitivity originates as a pronounced effect of variation of the degree of the SU(4)symmetry violation by the particle-particle interaction [10, 11]). This property has\nbeen used in [7, 8] to fix the value of gpp for each of the s.p. bases so that the known\nhalf-lives of the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay are correctly reproduced. Such an adjustment of gpp ,\nwhen applied to all multipoles J \u03c0 , has been shown in [7, 8] to remove much of the\nsensitivity to the number of s.p. states, to the N N potential employed, and even\nto whether RQRPA or just simple QRPA methods are used. This is in contrast to\n0\u03bd\ntypical conclusion made in the recent past (see, e.g., [12, 4]) that the values of M \u2032\nvary substantially depending on all of these things.\nWe believe that the 2\u03bd decay rate is especially suitable for such an adjustment,\nin particular because it involves the same initial and final states as the 0\u03bd decay.\nMoreover, the QRPA is a method designed to describe collective states as well as\nto obey various sum rules. Both double-beta decay amplitudes, 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 and 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2,\nreceive contributions from many intermediate states and using one of them for\nfixing parameters of QRPA seems preferable.\nCzech.

To see the dependence on the chosen gA value, both values\n0\u03bd\nof gA have been used (for all multipoles). The matrix elements M \u2032 calculated for\nthe three s.p. bases and a fixed gA are relatively close to each other.\n0\u03bd\nFor each nucleus the corresponding average hM \u2032 i matrix elements (averaged\nover the three choices of the s.p. space) is evaluated, as well as its variance \u03c3. The\n0\u03bd\n2\u03bd\nerrors induced in hM \u2032 i by the experimental uncertainties in Mexp\nare added to\nthe theoretical ones.\nThe calculated 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 matrix elements are presented in Fig. 1. There the averaged\nnuclear matrix elements for both methods and both choices of gA are shown along\nwith their full uncertainties (theoretical plus experimental). One can see that not\nonly is the variance substantially less than the average value, but the results of\nQRPA are quite close to the RQRPA values. Furthermore, the ratio of the matrix\nelements calculated with different gA is closer to unity (in most cases they differ\nonly by \u223c20%) than the ratio of the respective gA squared (1.6 in our case). Again,\nsuch a partial compensation of the gA -dependence has its origin in the adopted way\n2\u03bd\nof fixing gpp to reproduce Mexp\nbecause one needs smaller gpp for smaller gA .\n4\n\nA\n\nCzech. J. Phys. 51 (2001)\n\n\f...\n0\u03bd\n\nOne can qualitatively understand why our chosen procedure stabilizes the M \u2032\nmatrix elements as follows: M 2\u03bd matrix elements involve only the 1+ states in the\nintermediate odd-odd nucleus. The contributions of the 1+ multipole for both modes\nof the \u03b2\u03b2 decay depend very sensitively on gpp due to a proximity to the point of\nthe phase-transition in the 1+ channel (corresponding to the collapse of the QRPA\nequations of motion). On the other hand, virtual excitations of many states of\ndifferent multipolarities in the intermediate odd-odd nucleus contribute to the M \u2032 0\u03bd\nmatrix element, due to the presence of the neutrino propagator. The multipoles,\nother than 1+ , correspond to small amplitudes of the collective motion; there is no\ninstability for realistic values of gpp \u223c 1.0. Hence, they are much less sensitive to\nthe value of gpp . By making sure that the contribution of the 1+ multipole is fixed,\n0\u03bd\nwe therefore stabilize the M \u2032 value. The fact that RQRPA essentially removes\nthe instability becomes then almost irrelevant thanks to the chosen adjustment of\ngpp .\nOne can see in Fig. 2 of [8] that all multipoles J \u03c0 , with the exception of the\n+\n1 and various very small entries, contribute with the same sign and show the\nessential stability of the partial contributions against variation of the basis size. This\nsuggests that uncertainties in one or few of them will have relatively minor effect.\nIt is instructive to see separately the effect of the sometimes neglected short-range\nrepulsive nucleon-nucleon repulsion and of the induced weak nucleon currents. One\ncan see in Fig. 6 of [8] that the conclusion of the relative role of different multipoles\nis affected by these terms. For example, in 100 Mo the 1\u2212 multipole is the strongest\none when all effects are included, while the 2\u2212 becomes dominant when they are\nneglected.\n3\n\nUncertainties of the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay matrix elements\n\nIdeally, the chosen nuclear structure method should describe all, or at least\nvery many, experimental data and do that without adjustments. That is not the\ncase of the QRPA or the RQRPA. The interaction used is an effective interaction,\nand various parameters are adjusted. One of our goals in [8] was to show that a\nmajority of differences among various QRPA-like calculations can be understood\nand possible convergence of the QRPA results can be discussed.\nA detailed list of 13 main reasons leading to a spread of the published QRPA and\nRQRPA results is given in [8]. Some nuclei, like 100 Mo, exhibit more sensitivity to\nthese effects than others, such as 76 Ge or 82 Se. That is confirmed by our numerical\nstudies. The two very important reasons are:\n1) The choice of gpp (usually fixed to reproduce the experimental half-lives either\nof \u03b2-decays or of 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2-decay)\n2) Whether the two-nucleon short-range correlations (s.r.c.) are taken into account\n(for realistic gpp values neglecting s.r.c. would lead to a twofold increase in M 0\u03bd ).\nA moderate spread (which can be as much as tens of %) can originate from\nthe difference choices of the mean field, many-body approximations (RQRPA, SCQRPA etc.), the size of the model space, the residual nucleon-nucleon interaction\nCzech. J. Phys. 51 (2001)\n\nA\n\n5\n\n\fet al.\n\n(schematic zero-range or realistic interactions based on the G-matrix), renormalization of the axial-vector coupling constant gA = 1.0 \u00f7 1.25 and the higher order\nterms (h.o.t.) of the nucleon current (induced pseudoscalar and weak magnetism,\nabout 30% reduction in M 0\u03bd ).\nThe differences between many calculations are understandable just from the\nway gpp was fixed, the considered size of the model space, the inclusion of the s.r.c.\nand other minor effects.\nBased on our analysis, we suggest that it is not appropriate to treat all calculated\n0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2-decay matrix elements at the same level, as it is commonly done (see e.g.,\n[6, 12]), and to estimate their uncertainty based on their spread. Clearly, when\nsome authors do not include effects that should be included (e.g. the s.r.c. or the\nh.o.t. in the nucleon current) their results should be either corrected or neglected.\nSome effects are correlated, like the size of the model space and the renormalization\nof the particle-particle interaction. Again, if those correlations are not taken into\naccount, erroneous conclusion might be drawn. In our works [7, 8] we have shown\nthat our way of fixing the model parameters removes, or at least greatly reduces,\nthe dependence of the final result on most of the effects described above.\nEven after all relevant parameters have been carefully fixed, the QRPA is not\nable always to describe well all relevant weak transitions. In particular, it is sometimes impossible to describe simultaneously the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay rate as well as the \u03b2 \u2212\nand \u03b2 + /EC matrix elements connecting the 1+ ground states of the intermediate\nnucleus with the ground states of the final and initial nuclei (100 Mo is a well known\nexample of this problem, see e.g. [19]). That is an obvious drawback of the QRPA\nmethod; it is never meant to describe in detail properties of non-collective states.\nBut that is less relevant for the description of integral quantities that depend on\nsums over many states.\nThe calculations of the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2-decay matrix elements by Civitarese and Suhonen\n[12] deserve more comments. The authors performed them within the approach\nsuggested in [14] which employs the nucleon current derived from the quark wave\nfunctions. It is very important to note that in this approach the two\nnucleon s.r.c. are not taken into account. The h.o.t. of nucleon current were\nstudied [14] with the conclusion of their minor role (in contrast to our one).\nThe extension of the work [14] for the case when gpp is adjusted to reproduce\nthe single \u03b2-decay amplitudes was presented in [16]. In [12] the nuclear matrix\nelements are calculated in the same way as in [16], however, the obtained results\ndiffer significantly (see Table II of [8]) from each other. For some nuclei the difference\nis as large as a factor of two. There is no discussion of this there or in the later\nRefs. [12, 17]. It is noteworthy that the largest matrix element in [12] is found\nfor the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2-decay of 136 Xe that disagrees with the results of other authors. The\nreduction of the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2-decay of the 136 Xe is explained by the closed neutron shell\nfor this nucleus: a sharper Fermi surface leads to a reduction of this transition.\nAltogether, the matrix elements of [16, 12] are noticeably larger than the present\nones. Most of that difference can be attributed to the neglect of the s.r.c. and of\nthe h.o.t. of the nucleon weak current in these papers.\nIn summary of this section we list the main arguments why we believe that\n6\n\nA\n\nCzech. J. Phys. 51 (2001)\n\n\f...\n\nthe procedure of adjustment used in our works [7, 8] (gpp from the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2-decay)\nis preferable to the procedure advocated in [17] (gpp from the single \u03b2-decay) by\nSuhonen and in [18] by Suhonen and Civitarese:\ni) The QRPA is never meant to describe in detail properties of non-collective states\nlike the single beta decay of the ground state of a nucleus. Thus, it is more\nrelevant to fix the QRPA parameters using an integral quantity like the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2decay half-life and not the beta decay of a single state.\nii) We have showed in [8] that the first 1+ state of the intermediate nucleus is not the\nonly one contributing to the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2-decay amplitude. For instance, in A=76 system many excited intermediate 1+ states give comparable contributions (Fig. 8\nof [8]). Thus, to give preference to the lowest state is not well-justified, the entire\nsum is actually what matters.\niii) The contribution of the 1+ multipole to the M 0\u03bd and the corresponding M 2\u03bd are\ncorrelated (Fig. 8 of [8]). Making sure that the M 2\u03bd agrees with its experimental\nvalue constrains the 1+ part of the M 0\u03bd as well. The sensitivity of 1+ multipole\ncomponent of the M 0\u03bd to gpp far exceeds sensitivity of the other multipoles.\nHence, making sure that the whole 1+ multipole is correct is crucial.\niv) The approach of fixing gpp to reproduce the \u03b2 \u2212 decay of the first 1+ state of\nthe intermediate nucleus is limited only for nuclei with A=100, 116 and 128,\nwhere the ground state of the corresponding odd-odd nucleus has 1+ . At the\nsame time, the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2-decay half-life is known now practically for all nuclei of\nexperimental interest, i.e., one can use it to fix gpp .\nv) The running sum contributions to the M 0\u03bd in 76 Ge and 100 Mo (Figs. 8,9 of [8]),\nfor the different multipoles as well as for the total matrix element do not reveal\na single state dominance. Thus, it is not obvious that it is best to choose any\nparticular state or transition for the adjustment.\nvi) Finally, adjusting gpp to reproduce the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2-decay half-life essentially removes\nthe dependence on other parameters. While we have demonstrated that for all\n9 nuclear systems, a similar proof was not given in [17].\nIt clearly follows from the above analysis that the Table 3 of [17] does not reflect\nreal physical situation and therefore should be disregarded.\nIn the very recent publications of Civitarese and Suhonen [18] serious shortcomings are claimed in the procedure of fixing gpp adopted by us. Their criticism\nis based on the consideration of negative values of the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2-decay matrix elements\ncompatible with the data. But they have overlooked that if gpp is fixed to reproduce\nthe single \u03b2-decay data, the problem of negative values of the corresponding matrix\nelements is present as well. In [8] this criticism of [18] has been refuted by physical arguments which explain why solutions corresponding to the negative values of\n2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2-decay should not be considered.\nIt is also worth to mention that in [18] the calculations have been performed in\nthe QRPA without consideration of the effect of two-nucleon short-range correlations. The higher multipolarities are strongly suppressed by the s.r.c. and h.o.t. in\nthe nucleon current. Thus there is no more a clear dominance of the 2\u2212 multipolarity found in [18]. Of course, the inclusion of the s.r.c. and the induced pseudoscalar\nCzech. J. Phys. 51 (2001)\n\nA\n\n7\n\n\fet al.\n\ncoupling of nucleon current in the calculation of the M 0\u03bd is a question of physics\nand not just a matter of taste.\nIn addition, a new factor (me R)\u22122 introduced without any justification by Civitarese and Suhonen [18] into the definition of the M 0\u03bd will definitely contribute to\nthe confusion among the experimentalists working in the field.\n4\n\nSummary and conclusions\n\nWe have shown that the procedure suggested in our recent works, Refs. [7, 8],\nis applicable to essentially all nuclei with known 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay lifetimes. Adjusting\nthe strength of the particle-particle neutron-proton force gpp in such a way that\nthe experimental 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay rate is correctly reproduced removes much of the dependence on the size of the single-particle basis and whether QRPA or RQRPA\nis used. We have also shown that the quenching of the axial current matrix elements, parameterized by the reduction of the coupling constant gA , also leaves the\nresulting 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 matrix elements almost unchanged; they become insensitive to the\nvariations of parameters describing the short-range nucleon-nucleon correlations as\nwell. Thus, the resulting 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 matrix elements acquire well defined values, free of\nessentially arbitrary choices. We also present arguments while we believe that the\nchosen procedure of adjusting the interaction is preferable to other proposed ways\nof adjustment.\nThe differences in most, albeit not all, published QRPA and RQRPA results\ncan be understood. Comparison between the results of different QRPA/RQRPA\ncalculations would be facilitated if authors of future publications specify in detail\nwhat choices of explicit and implicit adjustable parameters they made, and discuss\nthe dependence of their result on their particular choice. By following these suggestions a consensus among the practitioners of QRPA/RQRPA could be reached\nand most of the spread between the calculated nuclear matrix elements, that causes\nmuch confusion in the wider physics community, would be shown to be essentially\nirrelevant. To reach a convergence of the results obtained using QRPA/RQRPA\nis clearly just an important step on the way to reliable and correct 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay\nnuclear matrix elements.\nThe work of F. \u0160. and V.
