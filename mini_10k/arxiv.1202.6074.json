We present a systematic derivation of a model based on the central moment\nlattice Boltzmann equation that rigorously maintains Galilean invariance of forces to\nsimulate inertial frame independent flow fields. In this regard, the central moments,\ni.e. moments shifted by the local fluid velocity, of the discrete source terms of the lattice\nBoltzmann equation are obtained by matching those of the continuous full Boltzmann\nequation of various orders. This results in an exact hierarchical identity between the\ncentral moments of the source terms of a given order and the components of the central\nmoments of the distribution functions and sources of lower orders. The corresponding\nsource terms in velocity space are then obtained from an exact inverse transformation\ndue to a suitable choice of orthogonal basis for moments. Furthermore, such a central moment based kinetic model is further extended by incorporating reduced compressibility effects to represent incompressible flow.

Originally developed as an improved variant of the lattice gas automata [1] to eliminate statistical noise [2], the lattice\n\u2217 Corresponding author.\n\nEmail addresses: knandhap@uwyo.edu (K.N.Premnath)\n\nhttp://www.global-sci.com/\n\nGlobal Science Preprint\n\n\f2\n\nBoltzmann method (LBM) has undergone a series of major refinements, in terms of its\nunderlying physical models as well as numerical solution schemes for various applications over the last two decades [3\u20136]. In particular, its rigorous connection to the kinetic\ntheory [7\u20139] has resulted in a number of recent developments, including models that\nare more physically consistent for multiphase [10, 11] and multicomponent flows [12],\nmodels for non-equilibrium phenomena beyond the Navier-Stokes-Fourier representation [13] and an asymptotic analysis approach to establish consistency of the LBM from a\nnumerical point of view [14].\nThe stream-and-collide procedure of the LBM can be considered as a dramatically\nsimplified discrete representation of the continuous Boltzmann equation. Here, the streaming step represents the advection of the distribution of particle populations along discrete\ndirections, which are designed from symmetry considerations, between successive collisions. Much of the physical effects being modeled are represented in terms of the collision\nstep, which also significantly influences the numerical stability of the LBM. Most of the\nmajor developments until recently were associated with the single-relaxation-time (SRT)\nmodel [15, 16] based on the BGK approximation [17], and enjoys its popularity owing,\nmainly, to its simplicity. However, it is prone to numerical instability. Moreover, it is\ninadequate in its representation of certain physical aspects, such as independently adjustable transport properties of thermal transport and viscoelastic phenomena.\nThese limitations have been significantly addressed in the multiple-relaxation-time\n(MRT) collision model [18]. This, in a sense, represents a simplified form of the relaxation\nLBM proposed earlier [19, 20], with an important characteristic difference in that the collision process is carried out in moment space [21] instead of in the usual velocity space.\nBy separating the relaxation time scales of different moments, obtained by using a linear\nFourier stability analysis, its numerical stability can be significantly improved [22, 23].\nFurthermore, it has resulted in significant advantages over the SRT-LBM for computation of various classes of fluid flow problems, including multiphase systems [24\u201326], turbulent flows [27, 28] and magnetohydrodynamics [29]. It may be noted that recently a\ndifferent form of MRT model based on the orthogonal Hermite polynomial projections\nof the distribution functions, which is independent of any underlying lattice structure,\nallowing representation of higher order non-equilibrium effects has been proposed [30].\nThe stabilization of the LBM using a single relaxation time has been addressed from a\ndifferent perspective by enforcing the H-theorem locally in the collision step [31\u201334]. By\nusing the attractors of the distribution function based on the minimization of a Lyapunovtype functional, non-linear stability of the LBM is achieved in this Entropic LBM. This approach has recently been significantly extended to incorporate multiple relaxation times\nwith efficient implementation strategies [35, 36]. Furthermore, systematic procedures for\ndifferent types of higher-order LBM have been developed [37\u201339]. An important element\nis the construction of higher-order lattices based on symmetry considerations which have\nbeen analyzed using group theory [40, 41]. Further progress, from a numerical aspect, is\nthat based on the consistency analysis [14] and a notion of structural stability [42, 43]\n(shown related to the Onsager-like relation in non-equilibrium thermodynamics [44]),\n\n\f3\n\nconvergence of the LBM to the Navier-Stokes equations has rigorously been shown [45].\nOn the other hand, it is important to clearly understand in what sense the lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE), which is generally considered as a mesoscopic approach, inherits\nor maintains the various physical invariance properties of the continuous full Boltzmann\nequation (which it represents as a much simplified model) and the Navier-Stokes equations (which it represents numerically). Careful considerations of these aspects play an\nimportant role in ensuring the general applicability of the approach for various, especially challenging, problems. In this regard, and to put the present work in perspective,\nit should be noted that the continuum mechanics description as well as the microscopic\nstatistical (continuous Boltzmann) description of fluid motion generally satisfy a larger\ninvariance group, with inertial frame invariance being just an important special case.\nThe most general form among these is the so-called the principal of material frame indifference, also known as the objectivity principle [46]. According to this, the constitutive\nequations should have the same forms in all frames of reference, whether inertial or not.\nWhile this is considered as an important axiom based on which the continuum mechanics\nis formulated [46], its role from continuous kinetic theory point of view was the subject\nof considerable analysis for sometime [47\u201352].\nThe following are the main outcomes of these studies: the continuous full Boltzmann\nequation (i) is material frame indifferent in a strong approximate sense, when there is a large\nscale separation between the collision times and the macroscopic flow times [49, 51, 52]\n(thus providing a strong support to the axiomatic principle generally used in the continuum description), (ii) satisfies both the inertial frame or Galilean invariance as well as\nthe extended Galilean invariance (i.e. invariance under arbitrary translational accelerations of the reference frame) exactly [52]. Furthermore, it was shown that the standard\nprocedures (e.g. Chapman-Enskog expansion, Maxwellian iteration) lead to frame dependent higher order contributions for the constitutive equations in non-inertial frames\nin the continuum limit, while the continuous kinetic theory itself can be frame independent [49]. Careful considerations of these principles could guide in the development of\nmore generally applicable models and numerical schemes for complex problems. For example, material frame indifference (point (i)) is generally used as an important constraint\nfor the constitutive equations for complex fluids (e.g. beyond Newtonian constitutive\ndescription such as polymeric fluids) and in the development of turbulence models in\ncontinuum mechanics. As mentioned above, this property is satisfied in a strong approximate sense by the continuous Boltzmann equation, but not necessarily by the tools\nthat relate the microscopic and macroscopic descriptions(point iii). This aspects are pertinent in the construction of complex models from the continuous Boltzmann equation\n(e.g. [53, 54]). In this work, however, we limit our discussion to an association of the\nproperties mentioned in a part of the point (ii) for the LBE, i.e. for the exact invariance\ngroup \u2013 the Galilean or inertial frame invariance.\nIn this regard, as a discrete approximation to the continuous full Boltzmann equation,\nthe development of the LBE consists of simplifications at different levels. Thus, its various elements should be analyzed carefully to ascertain and quantify as to how well it sat-\n\n\f4\n\nisfies Galilean invariance. First, in contrast to continuous kinetic theory, due to the choice\nof finite lattice velocity sets and associated symmetries, it introduces linear dependencies\nof higher order moments with those of lower order moments that are supported by the\nlattice set [40]. Such degeneracies can in turn lead to negative dependence of viscosity on\nfluid velocity. It generally causes the Galilean invariance to be broken by the presence of\nterms that are cubic in velocity for the standard lattice configurations (with symmetries of\nsquare in 2D and cube in 3D) and also leads to numerical instability, especially at higher\nMach numbers. This issue can be alleviated by the use of extended lattice velocity sets,\nwhich then relegates the degeneracies among moments to even higher orders. Second,\nthe collision step including the forcing terms of the LBE should be carefully constructed\nin such a way that they recover correct physics which is inertial frame independent, i.e.\nthe Navier-Stokes equations. Here, the use of independent set of central moments for a\nchosen lattice provides a natural approach to maintain Galilean invariance that can be\nconstructed by invoking elements directly from kinetic theory. This is the main goal of\nthe present work (see below). A rational means to more efficiently account for both the\nabove aspects is discussed in the last section of this paper. And, third, the streaming step\nof the LBE is generally constructed as a discrete Lagrangian process. In the standard implementation, this couples the particle velocity and configurations spaces, which in turn,\nconstrains the numerical accuracy of the LBE in the representation of the Navier-Stokes\nequations. As a result, the Galilean invariance of the LBE is limited by its overall numerical accuracy. However, it is known that such coupling between physical and lattice\nsymmetries is not necessary in the discretization of the streaming operator. In fact, it can\nbe discretized using classical schemes such as finite-difference or finite-element methods\nthat alleviate this issue [55\u201357]. Specifically, exploiting higher order discretization and\ntime integration schemes (e.g. [58]) for the streaming operator could further improve the\norder of accuracy (and hence the Galilean invariance) of the LBE. Furthermore, the use of\nimplicit schemes could enhance the computational efficiency in this regard.\nFocusing on the second aspect mentioned above, a different type of collision operator and forcing can be devised that can maintain Galilean invariance for a chosen lattice\nvelocity set and a discretization scheme for the streaming step. Specifically, central moments are relaxed in a moving frame of reference during collision step [59], originally\nproposed to improve numerical stability, but emphasized here for its better physical coherence. The use of central moments, which are obtained by shifting the particle velocity\nwith the local fluid velocity [60], rigorously enforces Galilean invariance. In particular,\nwhile other previous approaches are generally Galilean invariant for up to second-order\nmoments, the central moment based approach provides a higher order frame invariance\nas permitted by the discrete lattice velocity set. This approach was examined based on\nthe concept of generalized local equilibrium [61]. In addition, to further improve physical coherence, the attractors for the higher order central moments were constructed as\nproducts of the lower order central moments, leading to the factorized central moment\nmethod [62]. Recently, a new approach to incorporate source terms using central moments in the LBM that are Galilean invariant by construction, which are important for\n\n\f5\n\ncomputation of various physical problems, was developed [63]. The consistency of this\ntechnique to the Navier-Stokes equations was shown by means of the Chapman-Enskog\nanalysis [64] and its numerical accuracy was established. Furthermore, the method was\nalso extended in three-dimensions for various lattice velocity sets and validated for a\nclass of canonical problems [65]. As clarified in [63, 65], numerical stability of the central\nmoment approach can be enhanced, when it is executed in a multiple relaxation time\nformulation, similar to the standard or raw moment based approaches. Interestingly, it\nhas been shown recently that when some classical schemes for flow simulation are made\nto satisfy Galilean invariance more rigorously, they led to more robust implementations\n(e.g. [66, 67]).\nTurbulence remains as among the most challenging classes of flows for which considerable effort has been focused on the development of theory and applications using\nthe LBM. Since its roots can be traced to kinetic theory, the LBM has been analyzed\nfor the development of turbulence models from a fundamental point of view [68\u201370].\nIt has been employed for computation of Reynolds-averaged description of turbulent\nflows [71, 72]. Furthermore, it has found applications for large eddy simulation (LES)\nusing LBM formulations with SRT [73], and MRT [74] with multiblock approach for efficient implementation [27]. Recently, dynamic subgrid scale (SGS) models for LES were\nincorporated into the LBM framework that resulted in reduced empiricism for description at such scales [28]. Moreover, an improved inertial-range consistent SGS model was\nalso proposed [75]. A theoretical formulation for a SGS model based on an approximate\ndeconvolution method [78] that does not rely on the common eddy-viscosity concept for\napplication with the LBM was also devised recently [76]. Lastly, the closure modeling\nissues of kinetic and continuum turbulence effects were reconciled in a unified statistical/filtered description using a modified kinetic equation [77]. Effectively, this allows the\nuse of macroscopic turbulence models involving divergence of the Reynolds stress in the\nforcing term of the kinetic equation.\nAn important physical consideration for any description of turbulent flow is that it\nshould be invariant for all inertial frames of reference. In other words, for general applicability, representation of turbulence for all or any subset of its scales should be Galilean\ninvariant. Thus, in particular, all SGS models, and associated numerical schemes for\nturbulence computation, should be frame invariant. An insightful analysis of various\nturbulence models was carried out from this viewpoint in [79]. A method to achieve\nGalilean invariance by means of certain redefinition of turbulent stresses was discussed\nin [80]. A recent review on this subject is reported in [81]. Furthermore, it should be noted\nthat concepts based on central moments have played an important role in the development of theoretical foundation of turbulence physics \u2013 such as for statistical turbulence\ntheory [82] and turbulence modeling [83].\nThus, in this paper, we develop a lattice Boltzmann equation based on central moments for Galilean invariant representation of turbulent flows. Specifically, it allows\nframe-independent incorporation of general models for turbulent Reynolds stresses in\na statistical/filter averaged formulation using LBM for turbulence simulation. Further-\n\n\f6\n\nmore, in a general setting, it maintains the forces and stresses to be independent of any\ninertial frame of reference and could also improve numerical stability in computations.\nIn [63], we developed a forcing scheme based on a particular ansatz involving the local\nMaxwell distribution. Here, we develop a general forcing based on central moments by\na direct examination of the continuous full Boltzmann equation itself, which unlike [63]\ncould also self-consistently account for non-equilibrium effects in higher order terms.\nIn this regard, the central moments of the resulting source terms of the continuous and\ndiscrete counterparts are matched successively at different orders leading to a cascaded\nstructure. In essence, this approach can be considered as a Galilean invariant minimal\ndiscrete model for the full Boltzmann equation including forcing terms. The attractors\nfor higher order central moments in the collision step of this computational model is\nbased on the factorization in terms of those at lower orders by including such general\nforcing terms. In addition, we further develop this approach with reduced compressibility effects for improved representation of turbulent flow physics in the incompressible\nlimit. The forcing formulation developed here for incorporating turbulence models in a\nstatistical/filtered formulation can be extended to other problems, such as, for example,\nGalilean invariant representation of forces or stresses in complex fluids.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly discusses the choice of the moment basis employed in this paper and Sec. 3 the continuous Boltzmann equation. In\nSecs. 4 and 5, continuous forms of the central moments for the distribution functions\nand its local equilibrium, and sources due to force fields, respectively, are introduced.\nThe LBE based on central moments with the general forcing terms is presented in Sec. 6.\nVarious discrete central moments are presented in Sec. 7 that also specifies a matching\nprinciple to maintain Galilean invariance and the relationships among such moments are\nprovided in Sec. 8. Section 9 describes various discrete raw moments and the derivation\nof the source terms in terms of the discrete particle velocity space. In Sec. 10,we present\nthe construction of the collision operator of the central moment based LBM. The computational procedure of this approach is provided in Sec. 11. The derivation is extended by\nconsidering reduced compressibility effects in Sec. 12. Furthermore, Sec. 13 discusses the\nuse of attractors of the higher order central moments based on the concept of their factorization in term of those at lower orders. A natural consequence of this overall approach\nis that turbulence models can be represented for Galilean invariant filtered turbulence\nsimulation using the LBM, which is described in Sec. 14. Finally, the summary and conclusions of this work are discussed in Sec. 15.\n\n2 Selection of Moment Basis\nAn important element in the development of the central moment based LBM is the specification of a suitable basis for moments. In this work, to elucidate our approach, the\ntwo-dimensional, nine velocity (D2Q9) lattice model (see Fig. 1) is considered, for which\nthe moment basis used in [63] is adopted. It should, however, be noted that the procedure\n\n\f7\n\ne2\n\ne6\n\ne5\n\ne0\n\ne3\n\ne1\n\ny\ne7\n\ne4\n\ne8\n\nx\n\nFigure 1: Two-dimensional, nine-velocity (D2Q9) Lattice.\n\ndescribed henceforth is of general nature, and can be extended for other lattice models\n\u2192\nand in three dimensions.

It represents the evolution of the continuous density distribution function f = f ( x,y,\u03be x ,\u03be y ) in\n\u2212\n\u2192\ncontinuous phase space ( x,y,\u03be x ,\u03be y ) subjected to a local force field F = ( Fx ,Fy ), whose\norigin could be internal or external to the system. By definition, the averaged effects of f ,\nweighted by various powers of the continuous particle velocity (\u03be x ,\u03be y ), i.e. its moments,\n\n\f9\n\nare considered to characterize the various physical processes inherent in the motion of\nathermal fluids. In particular, the evolution of the slow hydrodynamical processes are\n\u2192\ndescribed by the local macroscopic fluid density \u03c1 and fluid velocity \u2212\nu = (u x ,uy ). The\ncontinuous Boltzmann equation may be written as [64, 84]\n\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2192 \u2212\n\u2192\n\u2192\nF \u2212\n\u2202f \u2212\n\u2192\n\u2192 f = \u03a9 ( f , f ),\nf\n+\n+ \u03be * \u2207\u2212\n* \u2207\u2212\nx\n\u03be\n\u2202t\n\u03c1\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere\n\u03c1 =\n\n\u2192\n\u03c1\u2212\nu =\n\nZ \u221eZ \u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e \u2212\u221e\nZ \u221eZ \u221e\n\u2212\u221e \u2212\u221e\n\nf d\u03be x d\u03be y ,\n\n(3.2)\n\n\u2212\n\u2192\nf \u03be d\u03be x d\u03be y .\n\n(3.3)\n\nHere, \u03a9( f , f ) is the collision term, which represents the cumulative effect of binary collision of particles. The force fields modify the distribution function exactly by the term\n\u2212\n\u2192 \u2212\n\u2192\n\u2192 f , which is obtained by moving the last term on the left hand side of Eq. (3.1)\n\u2212 F\u03c1 * \u2207 \u2212\n\u03be\nto its right to serve as a source term. It was shown by Grad (1949) [21] that that solution of Eq. (3.1) can be approximated by the evolution equations for a hierarchical set of\nmoments. Here, we seek to obtain a dramatically discretized version of this continuous\nBoltzmann equation by means of a hierarchy of central moments, focusing, in particular,\non the forcing term, to obtain Galilean invariant representation of the dynamics of fluid\nmotion.\n\n4 Continuous Central Moments: Distribution Function and its\nLocal Attractor\nWe now consider the integral properties of the distribution function f given in terms of\nits central moments, i.e. those shifted by the macroscopic fluid velocity. In particular, we\ndefine continuous central moment of f of order (m + n) as\nb x m yn =\n\u03a0\n\nZ \u221eZ \u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e \u2212\u221e\n\nf (\u03be x \u2212 u x )m (\u03be y \u2212 uy )n d\u03be x d\u03be y .\n\n(4.1)\n\nHere, and in the rest of this paper, the use of \"hat\" over a symbol represents quantities\nin the space of moments. The distribution function for an athermal fluid has a local\nequilibrium state in the continuous particle velocity space (\u03be x ,\u03be y ), which is given by the\nMaxwellian as [84]\n\uf8ee \u0010\n\u00112 \uf8f9\n\u2212\n\u2192 \u2212\n\u2192\n\u03be \u2212u \uf8fa\n\u03c1\n\uf8ef\n\u2192\nexp\n\u2212\n(4.2)\nf M \u2261 f M (\u03c1, \u2212\nu ,\u03be x ,\u03be y ) =\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fb,\n2\u03c0c2s\n2c2s\n\n\f10\n\nwhere c2s = 1/3. Analogously, we can define the corresponding central moment of the\nMaxwell distribution of order (m + n) as\nbM\n\u03a0\nx m yn =\n\nZ \u221eZ \u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e \u2212\u221e\n\nf M (\u03be x \u2212 u x )m (\u03be y \u2212 uy )n d\u03be x d\u03be y .\n\n(4.3)\n\nbM\nBy virtue of the fact that f M being an even function, \u03a0\nx m yn 6 = 0 when m and n are even and\nM\nb\n\u03a0 x m yn =0 when m or n odd. Here and henceforth, the subscripts xm yn mean xxx *** m-times\nand yyy *** n-times.

The explicit expressions for S\u03b1 and b\ng will be determined later in Secs. 9 and 10,\nrespectively. Since the main focus of this work is on improving the collision (including\nforcing) step with features independent of inertial frames, we have only considered the\nstandard discretization for the streaming operator.

The basic procedure can be stated as follows. Beginning\n\n\f23\n\nfrom the lowest order central moments that are non-collisional invariants (i.e. b\n\u03ba xx and\nhigher), they are successively set equal to their local attractors based on the transformed\nMaxwellians (Eq. (8.2)). This step provides tentative expressions for gb\u03b1 based on the\nequilibrium assumption. We then modify them to allow for relaxation during collision\nby multiplying them with corresponding relaxation parameters [59]. In this step, given\nthe cascaded nature of the collision (i.e. gb\u03b1 \u2261 gb\u03b1 (f, gb\u03b2 ),\u03b2 = 0,1,2,...,\u03b1 \u2212 1, or the dependence\nof higher order terms on those that are lower orders), care needs to be exercised to multiply the relaxation parameters only with those terms that are not yet in post-collision\nstates (i.e. terms not involving gb\u03b2 ,\u03b2 = 0,1,2,...,\u03b1 \u2212 1 for gb\u03b1 ). Various details involved in\nthis procedure are given in [63].

(9.6)-(9.14). Similarly, the raw moments of\n\u2032\nsources of various orders, i.e. b\n\u03c3x m yn needed in the above are given in Eqs. (9.15)-(9.23)\n(see Sec. 9). Here, \u03c9 \u03b2 , where \u03b2 = 3,4,5,...,8, are the relaxation parameters, satisfying\n0 < \u03c9 \u03b2 < 2. When a multiscale Chapman-Enskog expansion [64] is applied to this central moment LBM based on central moments, it recovers the Navier-Stokes equation with\n\u03bd\nthe relaxation parameters \u03c93 = \u03c9 \u03c7 and\n\u0001 \u03c94 = \u03c95 = \u03c9 controlling bulk and shear viscosi1\n1\n2\nties, respectively (e.g., \u03bd = cs \u03c9 \u03bd \u2212 2 ) [63]. The rest of the parameters can be adjusted to\nimprove numerical stability.\n\n\f24\n\n11 Cascaded Central Moment Lattice Boltzmann Equation\nThe collision step with the addition of forcing terms (see Eq. (6.2) and Eq. (9.50)) in the\nstream-and-collide procedure of the LBM, obtained by matching those of the continuous\nBoltzmann equation as discussed in the previous sections, is expanded element-wise and\ncan be summarized as follows:\nef =\n0\nef =\n1\nef =\n2\n\nef =\n3\nef =\n4\nef =\n5\n\nef =\n6\nef =\n7\nef =\n8\n\nf 0 +[ gb0 \u2212 4( gb3 \u2212 gb8 )]+ S0 ,\n\nf 1 +[ gb0 + gb1 \u2212 gb3 + gb4 + 2( gb7 \u2212 gb8 )]+ S1 ,\nf 2 +[ gb0 + gb2 \u2212 gb3 \u2212 gb4 + 2( gb6 \u2212 gb8 )]+ S2 ,\nf 3 +[ gb0 \u2212 gb1 \u2212 gb3 + gb4 \u2212 2( gb7 + gb8 )]+ S3 ,\nf 4 +[ gb0 \u2212 gb2 \u2212 gb3 \u2212 gb4 \u2212 2( gb6 + gb8 )]+ S4 ,\n\n(11.1)\n\nf 5 +[ gb0 + gb1 + gb2 + 2b\ng3 + gb5 \u2212 gb6 \u2212 gb7 + gb8 ]+ S5 ,\nf 6 +[ gb0 \u2212 gb1 + gb2 + 2b\ng3 \u2212 gb5 \u2212 gb6 + gb7 + gb8 ]+ S6 ,\nf 7 +[ gb0 \u2212 gb1 \u2212 gb2 + 2b\ng3 + gb5 + gb6 + gb7 + gb8 ]+ S7 ,\nf 8 +[ gb0 + gb1 \u2212 gb2 + 2b\ng3 \u2212 gb5 + gb6 \u2212 gb7 + gb8 ]+ S8 .\n\nThe collision kernel gb\u03b2 needed here can be computed from the expressions given in the\nprevious section (see Sec. 10). The source terms in the velocity space can be obtained\nfrom Eqs. (9.39)-(9.47) (see Sec. 9). The remaining streaming step is carried out as usual\nby using the post collision values ef obtained from above. Once the local distribution\n\u03b1\n\nfunction is known, macroscopic fluid density and velocity fields satisfying the Galilean\ninvariant Navier-Stokes equations in the presence of force fields can be obtained from\nEqs. (9.52) and (9.53), respectively.\n\n12 Cascaded Collision Operator with Reduced Compressibility\nEffects\nWhile a main goal of this work is the introduction of a self-consistent approach based on\nthe continuous Boltzmann equation to incorporate non-equilibrium effects into the central moment approach for general applicability, it is also useful to consider its limiting\ncases. For example, the incompressible limit of fluid flow corresponds to considering\nvery small deviations from the local equilibrium, a special case with various applications. In particular, this would allow simple representation of incompressible turbulence\nconsidered later in this work.\nBeing a kinetic approach, the lattice Boltzmann method is inherently compressible in\nnature. On the other hand, when it is desired to reproduce the \"incompressible\" Navier-\n\n\f25\n\nStokes equations as mentioned above, it is important to reduce such compressibility effects. An approach in this regard was introduced earlier in [87]. Here, we will extend\nit further in the context of the central moment LBM in the presence of forcing. It may\nbe noted that the fundamental expressions for the continuous central moments for the\nlocal equilibrium as well as the forcing given in Secs. 4 and 5, respectively, from which\ntheir discrete counterparts are derived, remains unchanged for this case. However, the\nkey element to incorporate a systematic reduction of compressibility effects lies in the\nfollowing careful definition of the raw moments of the hydrodynamic fields:\n\n\u03c1 =\n\n\u2192\n\u03c10 \u2212\nu =\n\n8\n\n8\n\n\u03b1 =0\n8\n\n\u03b1 =0\n\n\u2211 f\u03b1 = \u2211 f \u03b1 ,\n8\n\n(12.1)\n\n\u2192\n1\u2212\n\n\u2192\n\u2192\ne \u03b1 = \u2211 f \u03b1\u2212\ne \u03b1+ F .\n\u2211 f\u03b1 \u2212\n2\n\n\u03b1 =0\n\n(12.2)\n\n\u03b1 =0\n\nwhere \u03c1 = \u03c10 + \u03b4\u03c1. Here \u03c10 and \u03b4\u03c1 are the constant reference value and fluctuations of\ndensity, respectively.

It can thus allow for a better comparison with \"incompressible\" macroscopic fluid dynamic equations, particularly for turbulent flows as discussed\nlater.\n\n13 Factorized Central Moment Model for Collision\nIn this section, we will derive an alternative form of the central moment LBE with forcing\nterms based on a different choice of the local attractor in the collision step for improved\nphysical coherence. Continuous kinetic theory, as originally initiated by Maxwell [88],\nfeatures two important properties for the local equilibrium or the Maxwell distribution\n\u2013 Galilean invariance and factorization in Cartesian components of the particle velocity.\nAs discussed recently [39,62], it could prove useful to inherent these properties at the discrete particle velocity level. The use of central moments maintains Galilean invariance\nby construction. Factorization property of the distribution function implies that particle\nvelocities are random variables. An extension of the factorization idea beyond equilibrium as a model for describing the relaxation process during collision was proposed to\nconstruct local attractors [62]. Specifically, the basic postulate behind this model is that\nthe Cartesian products of the post-collision values of the orthogonal central moments of\n\n\f27\n\nlower orders that are not in equilibrium forms as the basis for the attractors of the higher\norder moments. Here, we further extend this to include source terms so that the model\ncan incorporate force fields. Thus, the attractors for central moments of different orders\nare given as\nb\n\u03babxat = e\n\u03ba x = 0,\nat\nb\n\u03bab\n= e\n\u03ba y = 0,\ny\n\nat\n\u03babxy\n\nat\nb\n\u03ba xxy\n\nb\n= e\n\u03ba xe\n\u03baby = 0,\nb\nb\n= e\n\u03ba xx e\n\u03ba y = 0,\n\n(13.1)\n(13.2)\n(13.3)\n(13.4)\n\nat\n\u03babxyy\n= e\n\u03babx e\n\u03babyy = 0,\n\n(13.5)\n\ne\n\u03babxx = \u03babxx +(6b\ng3 + 2b\ng4 ),\ne\nb\n\u03ba yy = \u03babyy +(6b\ng3 \u2212 2b\ng4 ).\n\n(13.7)\n\nat\nb\nb\n\u03ba xxyy\n= e\n\u03babxx e\n\u03ba yy ,\n\n(13.6)\n\nwhile the second-order longitudinal central moments are obtained from Maxwellian as\nat = b\nat = \u03c1c2 .

The starting point in the statistical continuum description of turbulence is the Reynolds decomposition of the velocity\nfield of the fluid into 'resolved' and 'unresolved' parts. The resolved part is obtained\nby applying either some averaging in space or time (in the Reynolds Averaged NavierStokes (RANS) context) or by applying a filter (in the LES). Application of this decomposition to the Navier-Stokes (NS) equation leads to additional unknown terms involving\nproducts of the unresolved fields, which are Reynolds stresses (in RANS) or the subgrid\nstresses (in LES). This closure problem then becomes the main focus of turbulence modeling. Due to the scale invariance property of the NS equations [83], the averaged and the\nfiltered equations, as well as the additional stress-like closure terms have similar forms.\nThus, a unified statistical approach may be adopted for turbulence modeling. It is interesting to note that ideas based on kinetic theory provided the original inspiration for the\nReynolds decomposition [89] as well as early works on developing turbulence models.\nThe underlying motivation here is to develop a unified statistical averaged description (for RANS) or formal spatial filtered representation (for LES) of inertial frame invariant turbulence in a kinetic approach based on the LBM derived in earlier sections. This\nwould also allow reconciliation of continuum and non-continuum effects on turbulence\nas discussed recently [77]. The following notation for Reynolds decomposition is adopted\n\n\f29\n\n\u2192\nhere. For any scalar \u03c6, vector \u2212\nv and tensor Tij , we have\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03c6 = \u03c6 + \u03c6 , with \u03c6 = 0,\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\nv = \u2212\nv +\u2212\nv , with \u2212\nv = 0,\n\u2032\n\nTij = Tij + Tij ,\n\nwith\n\n\u2032\n\nTij = 0,\n\nwhere (*) is an operator representing either some form of statistical average or filter to\nobtain the resolved part and the symbols with primes denote the unresolved parts of the\nfield. As discussed in [77], application of the above decomposition directly to the continuous Boltzmann equation (Eq. (3.1)) leads to certain difficulties. In particular, using\n\u2032\nf = f + f for the distribution function in Eq. (3.1), which leads to a statistically averaged kinetic equation, does not provide a clear interpretation of turbulence physics. The\nlocal collision term needs to model all essential physics, including the non-linear and\nnon-local momentum transfer effects of turbulence. Moreover, the use of the averaged\nattractor based on the Maxwellian f M within the collision term \u03a9( f , f ) leads to model\u0014 \u2212\n\u0014 \u2212\n\u0015\n\u0015\n\u2192 \u2192 2\n\u2192 \u2192 2\n( \u03be \u2212\u2212\nu)\n( \u03be \u2212\u2212\nu)\n6= exp \u2212 2c2\ning difficulties since exp \u2212 2c2\n. Thus, an alternative approach is\ns\n\ns\n\nneeded to coherently represent continuum/kinetic effects on turbulence.\nTo circumvent these issues, a transformation for the velocities was recently suggested [77],\nwhich is adopted here to provide Galilean invariant turbulence representation. The key\nelement is to clearly separate the advective turbulence effects due to unresolved veloc\u2032\n\u2192\nity field \u2212\nu from the dissipative collision that represent microscopic effects. This is accomplished by an inspection of the local Maxwellian given in terms of the microscopic\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2192\nparticle velocity \u03be and the macroscopic fluid velocity \u2212\nu . That is, it consists of the term\ninvolving the peculiar velocity\n\u2212\n\u2192 \u2212\n\u03be \u2212\u2192\nu\nas its argument which should be made independent of the unresolved part of the macro\u2032\n\u2192\nscopic fluid velocity \u2212\nu , when the averaging operator is applied. That is,\n\n\u2212\n\u2192 \u2192\u2032 \u2212\n\u2212\n\u2192 \u2212\n\u2032\n\u2192\nu ) = ( \u03be \u2212\u2212\nu )\u2212 \u2192\nu\n\u03be \u2212( \u2192\nu +\u2212\nshould be transformed appropriately, which can be accomplished by defining a new vari\u2192\nable \u2212\n\u03b7 as\n\u2212\n\u2192 \u2192\u2032\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u03b7 = \u03be \u2212\u2212\nu .\n(14.1)\n\u2212\n\u2192 \u2212\n\u2192\nNow, the Maxwellian in the transformed peculiar\nvelocity\ni \u03b7 \u2212 hu commutes\ni with the\nh \u2212\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n2\n(\u2212\n\u03b7 \u2212\u2212\nu )2\n(\u03b7\u2212u)\n= exp \u2212 2c2\n.

(14.6), can\nbe further simplified by considering the following simple microscopic closure [77]\n\n\u2192\nh\u2212\nu\n\u2032\n\u2212\n\u2192\nha\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2192\n\u2248 h\u2212\nu = 0,\n\u2212\n\u2192 \u2192\u2032 \u2212\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2248 h a = h \u2207 x *(\u2212\nu \u2192\nu )\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n(14.7)\n(14.8)\n\n\u2032\n\nThat is, h is uncorrelated with both ui and ai , which reproduces the averaged momentum\n\u2032 \u2032\nequations with additional Reynolds stress terms ui u j that can be closed by means of any\nconventional macroscopic turbulence models. Thus, Eq. (14.6) can now be rewritten as\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192 \u2192\u2032 \u2212\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2032\n\u2192\n\u2202t h + \u2212\n\u03b7 * \u2207 x h = \u03a9(h,h)+ \u2207 x *(\u2212\nu \u2192\n(14.9)\nu )* \u2207 \u03b7 h,\n\n\f31\n\nwhich represents the evolution of the statistical averaged/filtered turbulence field by\nmeans of the Reynolds stresses that appear as a forcing term in a kinetic framework.\nLet us now develop a Galilean invariant lattice kinetic equation, i.e. which provides\ninertial frame invariant representation with respect to the resolved velocity field obtained\nby statistical averaging/filtering. For brevity and to avoid the use of additional new\nnotations, let us rewrite Eq. (14.9) by replacing h by f (and \u03b7 and \u03be) to make use of the\ndevelopments of the previous sections. That is,\n\n\u2212\n\u2192 \u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192 \u2192\u2032 \u2212\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2032\n\u2202t f + \u03be * \u2207 x f = \u03a9( f , f )+ \u2207 x *(\u2212\nu \u2192\nu )* \u2207 \u03be f .\n\n(14.10)\n\nfrom which the resolved hydrodynamic fields can be defined as follows:\n\u03c1=\n\nZ\n\n\u2212\n\u2192\nfd \u03be ,\n\n\u2192\n\u03c1\u2212\nu =\n\nZ\n\n\u2212\n\u2192 \u2212\n\u2192\nf \u03bed\u03be.\n\n(14.11)\n\nNow, we define operator averaged continuous central moments as\nb x m yn =\n\u03a0\n\nZ \u221eZ \u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e \u2212\u221e\n\nf (\u03be x \u2212 u x )m (\u03be y \u2212 uy )n d\u03be x d\u03be y\n\n(14.12)\n\nbM\nand similarly for the continuous central moments of the Maxwellian \u03a0\nx m yn based on re\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\nM\nM\nplacing h and \u03b7 by f and \u03be , respectively. The Cartesian components of the unre-\n\nsolved turbulent Reynolds stresses may be written as\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nax = \u2212\u2202x (u x u x )\u2212 \u2202y (u x uy ),\nay = \u2212\u2202x (u x uy )\u2212 \u2202y (uy uy ),\n\n(14.13)\n(14.14)\n\n\u2192\nwhere \u2212\na = ( ax ,ay ), from which we analogously define a source/sink continuous central\nmoment as\nZ \u221eZ \u221e\n\u2032\na\nb\n\u0393 x m yn =\n(14.15)\n\u03b4 f a (\u03be x \u2212 u x )m (\u03be y \u2212 uy )n d\u03be x d\u03be y .\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2212\u221e \u2212\u221e\n\n\u2192\na\n\u2032 \u2212\n\u2192\nHere, \u03b4 f a = \u2212\u2212\na * \u2207 \u03be f . It readily follows from Eq. (5.4) that b\n\u0393x m yn also satisfies the\na\n\u2032\nb x m\u22121 yn + na\u2032y \u03a0\nb x m yn\u22121 . That is, the statistical averfollowing exact identity b\n\u0393 x m yn = max \u03a0\naged/filtered central moment of sources/sinks due to unresolved fields of a given order\nis dependent on the product of the Cartesian components of the gradients of turbulent\nstresses with the lower order central moments of the averaged/filtered distribution function. The corresponding discrete central moment LBM can be devised by considering the\nfollowing averaged representation of discrete vectors supported by the particle velocity\ng = |b\ng ,b\ng ,b\ng ,...,b\ng ) T , S = |S\u03b1 i = (S0 ,S1 ,S2 ,...,S8 ) T ,\ng i = (b\nset: f = | f \u03b1 i = ( f , f , f ,..., f ) T , b\n0 1 2\n8\n\u03b1\n0 1 2\n8\nand \u03a9c \u2261 \u03a9c (f,b\ng)=(K* b\ng)=(\u03a90c ,\u03a91c ,\u03a92c ,...,\u03a98c ) T , and invoking Galilean invariance matching principle, i.e. matching the continuous and discrete central moments of various quantities at successively higher orders as discussed in earlier sections. In particular, the statistical averaged/filtered discrete collision operator \u03a9c can be obtained by considering\n\u2032\n\n\f32\n\nreduced compressibility effects and factorized attractors as in Sec. 13. Furthermore, the\ncorresponding source terms in velocity space S can be constructed using the procedure\noutlined in Sec. 9. The operator averaged LBE, in terms of the transformed distribution\nfunction f for improved accuracy, can be finally written as\n\u03b1\n\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\nf (\u2212\n+ S\u03b1(\u2212\nx +\u2212\ne \u03b1 ,t + 1) = f (\u2212\nx ,t)+ \u03a9c\u03b1(\u2212\n\u2192\nx ,t) ,\nx ,t)\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\n(14.16)\n\nwhere f = f \u2212 21 S\u03b1 . Here, as before, we have adopted the standard discretization for the\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nstreaming step (see the comment following Eq. (6.5)). The resolved hydrodynamic fields\nin the reduced compressibility formulation can then be obtained as\n8\n\n\u03c1 =\n\n\u2211 f \u03b1 = h f \u03b1 |\u03c1 i ,\n\n\u03b1 =0\n8\n\n\u03c10 u i =\n\n1\n\n\u2032\n\n(14.17)\n1\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2211 f \u03b1 e\u03b1i + 2 \u03c1 ai = h f \u03b1 |e\u03b1i i+ 2 \u03c1 ai .\n\ni \u2208 x,y\n\n(14.18)\n\n\u03b1 =0\n\nThis provides a minimal lattice kinetic equation for incorporating turbulence models,\nwhere the unresolved turbulent motion are inertial frame invariant with respect to the\nresolved fluid motion. Here, we clarify the meaning of this statement as follows. Unlike\nother areas in fluid mechanics, where models have been developed starting from continuous kinetic theory, its role for fluid turbulence has been more limited. This is mainly\ndue to the fact that kinetic theory generally considers distinct scale separation of physical\nprocesses. On the other hand, turbulence is a flow phenomenon intrinsically containing\na continuous spectrum of scales with no scale separation. As such, therefore, turbulence modeling developments have to rely much on phenomenology whose mathematical forms are then constrained by invariance principles (e.g. material frame indifference\nand inertial frame invariance mentioned earlier in the introduction) and realizability considerations [81, 90]. Thus, except for some early models such as those based on mixing\nlength concepts and derivation of some recent phenomenological models (e.g. [54]) based\non kinetic theory, turbulence modeling developments are generally based on macroscopic\nmodels. The ultimate goal of our central moment approach for the filtered kinetic equation discussed above, is, then, to simulate resolved turbulent fields which are inertial\nframe independent, when an appropriate macroscopic turbulence model for the unresolve field is used in the forcing term.\n\n15 Summary and Conclusions\nA discrete lattice kinetic model for the continuous Boltzmann equation, including forcing, based on central moments is derived. The collision operator as well as the source\nterm of this lattice Boltzmann equation is constructed by matching the corresponding\ncontinuous and discrete central moments successively at various orders. The local attractor of the collision operator is constructed to satisfy the factorization property of the\n\n\f33\n\nMaxwellian during relaxation process. An exact hierarchical identity of the central moment of sources, that incorporates non-equilibrium effects, is maintained at the discrete\nlevel. The resulting approach provides Galilean invariant hydrodynamic fields in the\npresence of any external or self-consistent internal forces in a discrete kinetic framework.\nIt is further extended to incorporate reduced compressibility effects for better representation of incompressible flow, a limiting case. An important physical characteristic of\nturbulent flows is that it is inertial frame independent for all or any subset of scales. In\nconsequence, for general applicability, all turbulence models and their simulation approaches, should satisfy this requirement. A statistical averaged/filtered lattice kinetic\nequation based on central moments that maintains Galilean invariant representation of\nunresolved fluid motion with respect to the resolved fields of turbulent flow is thus constructed. The formalism presented here can extended to other lattice velocity sets and in\nthree-dimensions as well as to other physical problems such as complex fluids.\nIn this regard, we make the following remark on the development of more efficient\nschemes for the former aspect. Symmetry and finiteness of the standard lattice sets lead\nto degeneracies of higher order moments in terms those at lower orders that can result\nin frame dependent contributions to viscous stresses. This necessitates considerations of\nextended lattice sets. In this case, it is proposed that the central moments relaxation (as\nwell as forcing) be considered only up to those higher order moments that have bearing\non the physics of hydrodynamics, such as stress tensors and heat flux vectors. In turn, this\nwould impose Galilean invariance of the macroscopic description of the fluid motion.\nThe relaxation of the rest of the higher moments (including forcing) related to the fast\nkinetic or ghost modes can be considered in terms of the standard or raw moments. Here,\nthe form of the hierarchical identity for the sources derived in this paper for those higher\n(kinetic) moments would be the same with the simple replacement of the central moment\nterms by the corresponding raw moments. It is envisaged that such mixed central/raw\nmoment approach would exhibit interesting mathematical structures for the resulting\ncollision operator and the sources, as well as being computationally more effective. This\nstrategy is currently under investigation.\n\nReferences\n[1] U. Frisch, B. Hasslacher and Y. Pomeau, Lattice-Gas Automata for the Navier-Stokes Equation, Phys. Rev.
