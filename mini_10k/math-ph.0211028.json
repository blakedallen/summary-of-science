It is based in the classical\ntechnique of generating functions adapted to the special features of nonholonomic systems. The\ntheoretical methodology and the integrators obtained are different from the obtained in [12].\nIn the case of mechanical systems with linear constraints a family of geometric integrators\npreserving the nonholonomic constraints is given.\nAMS classification scheme numbers: 37J60, 58F05, 37M15\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.1\n\nIntroduction to nonholonomic mechanics\n\nThe theory of systems with nonholonomic constrains goes back to the XIX century. D'Alembert's\nor Lagrange-D'Alembert's principle of virtual work and Gauss principle of least constraint can be\nconsidered to be the first solutions to the analysis of systems with constraints, holonomic or not.\nAfter a period of decay, recently many authors show a new interest in that theory and also in its\nrelation to the new developments in control theory, subriemannian geometry, robotics, etc (see, for\ninstance,[44]). The main characteristic of this period was that Geometry was used in a systematic\nway (see L.D. Fadeev and A.M. Vershik [48] as an advanced and fundamental reference and, also,\n[3, 4, 7, 10, 13, 23, 24, 27, 28, 29, 37])\nAs is well known, in most problems of particle mechanics, the motion of the particles is constrained\nin some way; this is the term used to denote the condition that some motions or configurations are\nnot allowed. First, we will start with a configuration space Q, which is a n-dimensional differentiable\nmanifold, with local coordinates q i . General two-side or equality constraints are functions of the\nform \u03c6a (q i , q\u0307 i ) = 0, 1 \u2264 a \u2264 m, depending, in general, on configuration coordinates and their\nvelocities. The various kinds of constraints we are concerned with will roughly come in two types:\nInstituto de Matem\u00e1ticas y F\u0131\u0301sica Fundamental, CSIC, Serrano 123,\nmdeleon@imaff.cfmac.csic.es, d.martin@imaff.cfmac.csic.es, aitors@imaff.cfmac.csic.es\n\u2217\n\n1\n\n28006\n\nMadrid,\n\nSpain,\n\n\fholonomic and nonholonomic, depending whether the constraint is derived from a constraint in the\nconfiguration space or not. Therefore, the dimension of the space of configurations is reduced by\nholonomic constraints but not by nonholonomic constraints. Thus, holonomic constraints permit\na reduction in the number of coordinates of the configuration space needed to formulate a given\nproblem (see [44]).\nWe will restrict ourselves to the case of nonholonomic constraints, since the case of holonomic\nconstraints, and, in particular, the construction of holonomic integrators, is well established in the\nexisting literature. Geometrically, nonholonomic constraints are globally described by a submanifold M\u0303 of the velocity phase space T Q, the tangent bundle of the configuration space Q. In case\nM\u0303 is a vector subbundle of T Q, we are dealing with linear constraints. We will usually refer to\nM\u0303 as D and, in such case, the constraints are alternatively defined by a distribution D on the\nconfiguration space Q. If this distribution is integrable, we are precisely in the case of holonomic\nconstraints. In case M\u0303 is an affine subbundle modeled on a vector bundle D, we are in the case of\naffine constraints. In the sequel, we will denote by D the constraint submanifold on the velocity\nphase space, no matter if they are determined by linear or nonlinear constraints.\nGiven the constraints, we need to specify the dynamical evolution of the system. The central\nconcepts permitting the extension of mechanics from the Newtonian point of view to the Lagrangian\none are the notions of virtual displacements and virtual work; these concepts were formulated\nin the developments of mechanics, in their application to statics. In nonholonomic dynamics,\nthe procedure is given by Lagrange-D'Alembert's principle. We usually consider nonholonomic\nconstraints of linear type, which are the constraints that we will regard as natural in a mechanical\nsense (although the extension for general nonholonomic constraint will be straightforward). We now\ncome to the description of the constraint forces; for constraints of that type, Lagrange-D'Alembert's\nprinciple allows us to determine the set of possible values of the constraint forces only from the\nset of admissible kinematic states, that is, from the constraint manifold D determined by the\nvanishing of the nonholonomic constraints. Therefore, assuming that the dynamical properties of\nthe system are mathematically described by a configuration space Q, by a Lagrangian function\nL and by a distribution determining the linear constraints D, the equations of motion, following\nLagrange-D'Alembert's principle, are\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\nd \u2202L\n\u2202L\n\u2212 i \u03b4q i = 0 ,\n(1)\ndt \u2202 q\u0307 i\n\u2202q\nwhere \u03b4q i denotes the virtual displacements verifying\n\u03bcai \u03b4q i = 0\n\n(2)\n\nand D o = span {\u03bca = \u03bcai dq i } (for the sake of simplicity, we will assume that the system is not\nsubject to non-conservative forces). By using the Lagrange multiplier rule we obtain that\n\u0013\n\u0012\nd \u2202L\n\u2202L\n(3)\n\u2212 i = \u03bb\u0304a \u03bcai .\ni\ndt \u2202 q\u0307\n\u2202q\n2\n\n\fThe term on the right represents the constraint force or reaction force induced by the constraints.\nThe functions \u03bb\u0304a are Lagrange multipliers to be determined in order to obtain a set of second order\ndifferential equations. These Lagrangian multipliers are computed using the constraint equations.\nAn interesting remark, that will be used in the sequel, is that whenever the Lagrange multipliers \u03bb\u0304a = \u03bb\u0304a (q i , q\u0307 i ) have been determined, then the system of equations (3) can be considered a\nLagrangian system subject to external conservative forces given by the right-hand side term, taking, obviously, an initial condition on the constraint submanifold D. Automatically, the choice of\nthe Lagrange multipliers \u03bb\u0304a implies that the solution integral curves also verifies the constraint\nequations.\n\n1.2\n\nIntroduction to Geometric Integration and Discrete Mechanics\n\nStandard methods for simulating the motion of a dynamical system, generically called numerical\nintegrators, usually take an initial condition and move it in the direction specified by the equation\nof motion or an appropriate discretization. But these standard methods ignore all the geometric\nfeatures of many dynamical systems, as for instance, for Hamiltonian systems we have preservation\nof the symplectic form, energy (in the autonomous case) and symmetries, if any. However, new\nmethods have been recently developed, called geometric integrators, which are concerned with some\nof the extra features of geometric nature of the dynamical systems. Usually, these integrators, in\nsimulations, can run for long times with lower spurious effects (for instance, bad energy behavior\nfor conservative systems) than the traditional ones. As is well known, the typical test example\nis the simulation of the solar system. Therefore, there is presently a great interest in geometric\nintegration of differential equations as, for instance, symplectic integrators of Hamiltonian systems\n[16, 47].\nDiscrete variational integrators appear as a special kind of geometric integrators. These integrators\nhave their roots in the optimal control literature in the 1960's and 1970's (Jordan and Polack [19],\nCadzow [8], Maeda [35, 36]) and in 1980's by Lee [25, 26], Veselov [43, 49]. In these papers, there\nappear the discrete action sum, discrete Euler-Lagrange equations, discrete Noether theorem...\nAlthough this kind of symplectic integrators have been considered for conservative systems [17, 20,\n38, 42, 50, 51], it has been recently shown how discrete variational mechanics can include forced\nor dissipative systems [21, 42], holonomic constraints [15, 42], time-dependent systems [30, 42],\nfrictional contact [46] and nonholonomic constraints (see [10, 12]). Moreover, it has been also\ndiscussed reduction theory [5, 6, 40, 41], extension to field theories [18, 39] and quantum mechanics\n[45]. All these integrators have demonstrated exceptionally good longtime behavior and the research\nof this topic is interesting for numerical and geometric considerations.\nNow, we will describe the discrete variational calculus, following the approach in [50] (see also\n[2, 14]). A discrete Lagrangian is a map Ld : Q \u00d7 Q \u2192 R (this discrete Lagrangian may be\nconsidered as an approximation of the continuous Lagrangian L : T Q \u2192 R). Define the action sum\n\n3\n\n\fSd : QN +1 \u2192 R corresponding to the Lagrangian Ld by\nSd =\n\nN\nX\n\nLd (qk\u22121 , qk ) ,\n\nk=1\n\n\u2217\nwhere qk \u2208 Q for 0 \u2264 k \u2264 N . For any covector \u03b1 \u2208 T(x\n(Q \u00d7 Q), we have a decomposition\n1 ,x2 )\n\u2217\n\u03b1 = \u03b11 + \u03b12 where \u03b1i \u2208 Txi Q. Therefore,\n\ndLd (q0 , q1 ) = D1 Ld (q0 , q1 ) + D2 Ld (q0 , q1 ) .\nThe discrete variational principle or Cadzow's principle states that the solutions of the discrete\nsystem determined by Ld must extremize the action sum given fixed points q0 and qN . Extremizing\nSd over qk , 1 \u2264 k \u2264 N \u2212 1, we obtain the following system of difference equations\nD1 Ld (qk , qk+1 ) + D2 Ld (qk\u22121 , qk ) = 0 .\nThese equations are usually called the discrete Euler-Lagrange equations. Under some regularity\nhypothesis (the matrix (D12 Ld (qk , qk+1 )) is regular) this implicit system of difference equations\ndefines a discrete flow \u03a5 : Q \u00d7 Q \u2212\u2192 Q \u00d7 Q, by \u03a5(qk\u22121 , qk ) = (qk , qk+1 ).\nThe geometrical properties corresponding to this numerical method are obtained defining the discrete Legendre transformation associated to Ld by\nF Ld :\n\nQ \u00d7 Q \u2212\u2192 T \u2217 Q\n(q0 , q1 ) 7\u2212\u2192 (q0 , \u2212D1 Ld (q0 , q1 )) ,\n\nand the 2-form \u03c9d = F L\u2217d \u03c9Q , where \u03c9Q is the canonical symplectic form on T \u2217 Q. The discrete\nalgorithm determined by \u03a5 preserves the symplectic form \u03c9d , i.e., \u03a5\u2217 \u03c9d = \u03c9d . Moreover, if the\ndiscrete Lagrangian is invariant under the diagonal action of a Lie group G, then the discrete\nmomentum map Jd : Q \u00d7 Q \u2192 g\u2217 defined by hJd (qk , qk+1 ), \u03bei = hD2 Ld (qk , qk+1 ), \u03beQ (qk+1 )i is\npreserved by the discrete flow. Therefore, these integrators are symplectic-momentum preserving\nintegrators. Here, \u03beQ is the fundamental vector field determined by \u03be \u2208 g.\nAnother alternative approach to discrete variational calculus comes from the classical theory of\ngenerating functions (see, for instance, [1]). Since (T \u2217 Q, \u03c9Q ) is an exact symplectic manifold, where\n\u03c9Q is the canonical symplectic form of T \u2217 Q and \u03c9Q = \u2212d\u03b8Q , the symplectic flow Fh : T \u2217 Q \u2192 T \u2217 Q of\na Hamiltonian vector field XH is a canonical transformation, and then Graph(Fh ), the graph of Fh ,\nis a Lagrangian submanifold of the symplectic manifold (T \u2217 Q \u00d7 T \u2217 Q, \u03a9) where \u03a9 = \u03c02\u2217 \u03c9Q \u2212 \u03c01\u2217 \u03c9Q .\nHere, we denote by \u03c0i : T \u2217 Q \u00d7 T \u2217 Q \u2192 T \u2217 Q, i = 1, 2 the canonical projections. Therefore, denoting\n\u0398 = \u03c02\u2217 \u03b8Q \u2212 \u03c01\u2217 \u03b8Q we have that\ni\u2217Fh \u03a9 = \u2212di\u2217Fh \u0398 = 0 ,\nwhere iFh : Graph(Fh ) 7\u2192 T \u2217 Q \u00d7 T \u2217 Q is the canonical inclusion. Then, at least locally, there exists\na function S h : Graph(Fh ) \u2192 R such that i\u2217Fh \u0398 = dS h . Taking (q i , pi ) as natural coordinates in\n\n4\n\n\fGraph(Fh ) and (q i , pi , qi , pi ) the coordinates in T \u2217 Q \u00d7 T \u2217 Q, then, locally S h is a function of (q, p)\ncoordinates. Hence, along Graph(Fh ), we have qi = qi (q, p) and pi = pi (q, p) and moreover\npi dqi \u2212 pi dq i = dS h (q, p) .\nAssume that in a neighborhood of some point x \u2208 Graph(Fh ), we can change this system of\ncoordinates by new independent coordinates (q i , qi ) (the local condition is that det (\u2202q/\u2202p) 6= 0).\nIn such a case, the function S h can be locally expressed as S h = S h (q, p) = S h (q, q). The function\nS h (q, q) will be called a generating function of the first kind of the canonical transformation Fh .\nMoreover,\n\uf8f1\n\u2202S h\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\np\n=\n\u2212\n,\n\uf8f4\ni\n\uf8f4\n\u2202q i\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nh\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 pi = \u2202S .\n\u2202qi\n\nA nice and useful interpretation of the discrete Euler-Lagrange equations is the following theorem\n[22, 32].\nTheorem 1.1 Let the function S N h be defined by\nS\n\nNh\n\n(q0 , qN ) =\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\nS h (qk , qk+1 ) ,\n\nk=0\n\nwhere qk , 1 \u2264 k \u2264 N \u2212 1, are stationary points of the right-hand side, that is\n0 = D2 S h (qk\u22121 , qk ) + D1 S h (qk , qk+1 ) ,\n\n1\u2264k \u2264N \u22121,\n\n(4)\n\nthen S N h is a generating function of first class for FN h : T \u2217 Q \u2192 T \u2217 Q, for h sufficiently small and\nwhere FN h denotes the flow of XH over time N h.\nMoreover, if we start with a regular Lagrangian function L : T Q \u2192 R, and H : T \u2217 Q \u2192 R is the\nlocally associated Hamiltonian, then we also have the following result (for example, see [32])\nProposition 1.2 A generating function of the first kind for Fh is given by\nZ h\nh\nS (q0 , q1 ) =\nL(q(t), q\u0307(t)) dt ,\n0\n\nwhere q(t) is a solution of the Euler-Lagrange equations such that q(0) = q0 and q(h) = q1 .\nThe conclusion is that the discrete variational calculus consists in taking an approximation of\nthe generating function S h . From this approximation we obtain a new Lagrangian submanifold of\nT \u2217 Q\u00d7T \u2217 Q and the relation between subsequent steps is given by (4) for the new generating function,\nwhich are precisely the discrete Euler-Lagrange equations. The symplecticity and preservation of\nmomentum are now direct consequences of this description.\n5\n\n\f1.3\n\nIntroduction to nonholonomic integrators\n\nIn a recent paper, J. Cort\u00e9s and S. Mart\u0131\u0301nez [12] have proposed a construction of nonholonomic\nintegrators which is useful for numerical considerations. Their construction is based on the discrete\nLagrange-D'Alembert's principle. Assuming that the constraints are given by a distribution D, this\nprinciple states that\n(D1 Ld (qk , qk+1 ) + D2 Ld (qk\u22121 , qk ))i \u03b4qki = 0,\n\n1\u2264i\u2264N \u22121,\n\nwhere \u03b4qk \u2208 Dqk and, in addition (qk , qk+1 ) \u2208 Dd . Here Dd denotes a discrete constraint space\nDd \u2282 Q \u00d7 Q. This integrator has a good performance and naturally inherits some geometric\nproperties of the continuous problem. Observe that the method is based on the discretization of\nthe Lagrangian and a coherent discretization of the constraints, and both determine the discrete\nconstraint forces.\nAlternatively, we propose a nonholonomic integrator also based on the discretization of the Lagrangian function (in a more precise sense, we discretize the action function) but now we take\na coherent discretization of the constraint forces and both determine the discrete constraint submanifold. This method gives us, in general, different integrators from those in [12]. The last\nconsiderations of the previous section will be our starting point to study nonholonomic integrators,\nand our equations will be conceptually equivalent to the proposed for systems with external forces\n(see [42]). In the particular case of mechanical systems with linear constraint in the velocities, we\nstudy a subclass of our family of nonholonomic integrators with the property of preservation of the\noriginal nonholonomic constraints.\n\n2\n\nGeometrical formulation of nonholonomic systems\n\nLet Q be a n-dimensional differentiable manifold, with local coordinates (q i ). The tangent bundle\nT Q, with induced coordinates (q i , q\u0307 i ), is equipped with two fundamental geometrical objects [33]:\nthe Liouville vector field \u2206 and the vertical endomorphism S. In natural bundle coordinates we\nhave\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2206 = q\u0307 i i , S = dq i \u2297 i .\n\u2202 q\u0307\n\u2202 q\u0307\nConsider a Lagrangian system, with Lagrangian L : T Q \u2192 R, subject to nonholonomic constraints,\ndefined by a submanifold D of the velocity phase space T Q. We will assume that dim D = 2n \u2212 m\nand that D is locally described by the vanishing of m independent functions \u03c6a (the \"constraint\nfunctions\").\nIn geometrical terms, D'Alembert's principle (or Chetaev's principle for nonlinear constraints)\nimplies that the constraint forces, regarded as 1-forms on T Q along D, take their values in the\nsubbundle S \u2217 (T D o ) of T \u2217 T Q, where T D o denotes the annihilator of T D in T \u2217 T Q. In an intrinsic\n\n6\n\n\fway, the equations of motion can be written as (see [27, 29])\n(iX \u03c9L \u2212 dEL )|D \u2208 S \u2217 (T D o ) ,\nX|D \u2208 T D ,\nwhere \u03c9L is the Poincar\u00e9-Cartan 2-form defined by \u03c9L = \u2212d(S \u2217 (dL)) and EL = \u2206(L) \u2212 L is the\nenergy function.\nIn the sequel we will also assume that the following admissibility condition holds\ndim T D o = dim S \u2217 (T D o ) .\nThis essentially means that the matrix (\u2202\u03c6a /\u2202 q\u0307 i ) has rank m everywhere.\nWe now turn to the Hamiltonian description of the nonholonomic system on the cotangent bundle\nT \u2217 Q of Q [3, 24, 37]. The canonical coordinates on T \u2217 Q are denoted by (q i , pi ), and the cotangent\nbundle projection will be \u03c0Q : T \u2217 Q \u2192 Q. Assuming the regularity of the Lagrangian, we have that\nthe Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations are locally equivalent. If we suppose, in addition, that\nthe Lagrangian L is hyperregular, then the Legendre transformation Leg : T Q \u2192 T \u2217 Q, (q i , q\u0307 i ) 7\u2192\n(q i , pi = \u2202L/\u2202 q\u0307 i ), is a global diffeomorphism. The constraint functions on T \u2217 Q become \u03a8a =\n\u03c6a \u25e6 Leg\u22121 , i.e.\n\u2202H\n\u03a8a (q i , pi ) = \u03c6a (q i ,\n),\n\u2202pi\nwhere the Hamiltonian H : T \u2217 Q \u2192 R is defined by H = EL \u25e6 Leg\u22121 . Since locally Leg\u22121 (q i , pi ) =\n\u2202H\n), then\n(q i ,\n\u2202pi\nH = pi q\u0307 i \u2212 L(q i , q\u0307 i ) ,\nwhere q\u0307 i is expressed in terms of q i and pi using Leg\u22121 .\nThe equations of motion for the nonholonomic system on T \u2217 Q can now be written as follows\n\uf8f1\n\u2202H\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 q\u0307 i =\n\u2202pi\n(5)\n\u2202\u03a8a\n\u2202H\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u1e57i = \u2212\n\u2212\n\u03bb\nH\n,\na\nji\n\u2202q i\n\u2202pj\n\ntogether with the constraint equations \u03a8a (q, p) = 0, where Hij are the components of the inverse\nof the matrix (Hij ) = (\u2202 2 H/\u2202pi \u2202pj ). Note that\n(\n\n\u2202\u03c6a\n\u2202\u03a8a\nHji )(q, p) = ( i \u25e6 Leg\u22121 )(q, p).\n\u2202pj\n\u2202 q\u0307\n\nThe symplectic 2-form \u03c9L is related, via the Legendre map, with the canonical symplectic form \u03c9Q\non T \u2217 Q. Let M denote the image of the constraint submanifold D under the Legendre transformation, and let F be the distribution on T \u2217 Q along M , whose annihilator is given by\nF o = Leg\u2217 (S \u2217 (T D o )) .\n7\n\n\fObserve that F o is locally generated by the m independent 1-forms\n\u03bca =\n\n\u2202\u03a8a\nHij dq j , 1 \u2264 a \u2264 m .\n\u2202pi\n\nThe \"Hamilton equations\" for the nonholonomic system can be then rewritten in intrinsic form as\n(iX \u03c9Q \u2212 dH)|M\nX|M\n\n\u2208 Fo\n\u2208 TM .\n\n(6)\n\nSuppose in addition that the following compatibility condition F \u22a5 \u2229 T M = {0} holds, where \" \u22a5 \"\ndenotes the symplectic orthogonal with respect to \u03c9Q . Observe that, locally, this condition means\nthat the matrix\n\u0013\n\u0012 a\n\u2202\u03a8b\n\u2202\u03a8\nab\nHij\n(7)\n(C ) =\n\u2202pi\n\u2202pj\n\nis regular.

The compatibility condition is\n\u2202 q\u0307 i \u2202 q\u0307 j 1\u2264i,j\u2264n\nnot too restrictive, since, taking into account the admissibility assumption, it is trivially verified by\nthe usual systems of mechanical type (i.e. with a Lagrangian of the form kinetic minus potential\nenergy), where the Hij represent the components of a positive definite Riemannian metric. The\ncompatibility condition guarantees in particular the existence of a unique solution of the constrained\nequations of motion (6) which, henceforth, will be denoted by XH,M on the Hamiltonian side and\n\u03beL,D on the Lagrangian side.\nMoreover, if we denote by XH the Hamiltonian vector field of H, i.e., iXH \u03c9Q = dH then, using the\nconstraint functions, we may explicitely determine the Lagrange multipliers \u03bba as\n\u03bba = \u2212Cab XH (\u03a8b ) .\nNext, writing the 1-form\n\u039b = \u2212Cab XH (\u03a8b )\n\n\u2202\u03a8a\nHji dq i ,\n\u2202pj\n\nthe nonholonomic equations are equivalently rewritten as\n\uf8f1\n\u2202H\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 q\u0307 i =\n,\n\u2202pi\n\u2202H\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u1e57i = \u2212\n\u2212 \u039bi ,\n\u2202q i\n\n(9)\n\nfor initial conditions (q0 , p0 ) \u2208 M and \u039b = \u039bi dq i . We also denote by \u039b\u0303 = Leg \u2217 (\u039b) the 1-form on\nT Q wich represents the constraint force once the Lagrange multipliers have been determined.\nNow, consider the flow Ft : M \u2192 M , t \u2208 I \u2286 R of the vector field XH,M , solution of the\nnonholonomic problem.\n8\n\n\fSince (9) is geometrically rewritten as\niXH,M \u03c9Q = dH + \u039b ,\n(i\u03beL,D \u03c9L = dEL + \u039b\u0303, with \u039b\u0303 = Leg\u2217 \u039b, on the Lagrangian side) then\nLXH,M \u03b8Q = d(iXH,M \u03b8Q \u2212 H) \u2212 \u039b ,\nor, equivalently,\nLXH,M \u03b8Q = d(L \u25e6 Leg\u22121 ) \u2212 \u039b .\nNow, from the dynamical definition of the Lie derivative, we have\n\u0001\nd\nFt\u2217 LXH,M \u03b8Q =\n(F \u2217 \u03b8Q ) ,\ndt t\n\nand integrating, we obtain the following expression, with some abuse of notation,\nFh\u2217 \u03b8Q\n\n\u2212 \u03b8Q = d\n\n\u0012Z\n\n\u0013\n\nh\n\nL \u25e6 F\u0303t dt \u2212\n\n0\n\nZ\n\nh\n\n0\n\nFt\u2217 \u039b ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere F\u0303t is the flow of the vector field \u03beL,D . In next sections, we will study geometric integrators\nwhich verify a discrete version of equation (10).\n\n3\n\n\"Generating functions\" and nonholonomic mechanics\n\nNext, we will follow similar arguments for the construction of generating functions for symplectic\nor canonical maps [1]. However, because of equation (10), we have that the nonholonomic flow is\nnot a canonical transformation; i.e.,\n\u0013\n\u0012Z h\n\u2217\n\u2217\nFt \u039b .\n(11)\nFh \u03c9Q \u2212 \u03c9Q = d\n0\n\nThis description will allow us to construct a new family of nonholonomic integrators for equations\n(3).

This algorithm is\nbased in the underlying geometry of nonholonomic systems. For mechanical systems with linear\nconstraints, a geometric integrator preserving constraints is proposed.\nIn future work, we will explore reduction schemes for discrete systems using the approach of generating functions. It is also interesting to use generating functions of different kinds; in a recent\nwork [31], we have shown that generating functions of second class generate algorithms which are\nsymplectic (in some sense) for discrete optimal control theory (see also [32]). Moreover, we may\neasily extend the generating function technique in order to consider variable time stepping and also\nthe time-dependent case and it would be possible to use this formalism for classical field theories.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work has been supported by grant BFM2001-2272.
