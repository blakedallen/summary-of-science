No imaginary quantity\nappears and the entropy reveals good behavior. The anomalous pressure of tachyons vanishes but this concept may play very important\nrole in the thermodynamics of other forms of exotic matter.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe concept of tachyon fields plays significant role in the modern research,\nwhere they often appear in the field theory, cosmology, theory of branes and\nstrings with various applications [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Tachyons, are commonly\n\n1\n\n\fknown as field instabilities whose energy spectrum is\n\u221a\n\u03b5k = k 2 \u2212 m2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere m is the tachyon mass and we use the system of standard relativistic\nunits clight = h\u0304 = kB = 1. Of course, it highly desirable to consider such substances as an ideal gas of particles with a given energy spectrum because this\nmodel allows to calculate all thermodynamical parameters of exotic matter.\nA system of many tachyons can be studied in the frames of statistical\nmechanics [6, 7], and thermodynamical functions of ideal tachyon Fermi and\nBose gases are calculated [8, 9]. The properties of cold tachyon Fermi gas\n[10], its low-temperature behavior [11], tachyonic thermal excitations [12]\nand the hot tachyon gas [13] are also investigated.\nMost peculiar behavior of tachyon gas concerns that fact that the system\nof tachyons may exist as a stable continuous medium when it satisfies the\ncausality condition\ncs \u2264 1\n(2)\nThe tachyon energy spectrum (1) is defined at k \u2265 m, so we have taken\nlimits of integration in the range m \u2264 k < \u221e for all thermodynamical\nquantities [10]. The latter fact may result in contradiction to the third law\nof thermodynamics, and we check it in the present paper. If so, an anomalous\npressure term will be necessary to avoid this trouble. However, appearance\nof the anomalous pressure implies that our previous analysis of cold tachyon\nFermi gas [10] is incorrect. Either the anomalous pressure term is really\npresent, or it is necessary to reformulate the theory and find right definitions\nfor the energy spectrum and distribution function of tachyon gas.\n\n2\n\nThermodynamical functions\n\nConsider an ideal Fermi gas of N free particles enclosed in volume V .

However, we need to check whether\nthis concept is working at finite temperature. Otherwise, we need to look for\nthe right approach to the statistical mechanics of tachyons.\n\n4\n\nTachyon pressure at finite temperature\n\nConsider the tachyon anomalous pressure (32) at finite temperature.

It is clear that S\u0304|T =0 6= 0.\nThe chemical potential of tachyon Fermi at low temperature acquires a\nquadratic dependence on temperature [11]\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c0 2 kF2 + \u03b52F 2\nT\n(41)\n\u03bc = \u03b5F 1 \u2212\n6 kF2 \u03b52F\nS\u0304 =\n\nand the energy density and pressure are expanded in a power series of T :\n\u0001\n\u0001\nE = E|T =0 + O T 2\nP\u0304 = P\u0304 |T =0 + O T 2\n(42)\nIt results in a linear dependence of the entropy density on temperature\nS\u0304 =\n\n\u03b3V\n\u03b5F k F T\n6\n\n(43)\n\nAppearance of anomalous pressure P\u0303 results in additional contribution\nto the entropy (39). Substituting (41) in (36), we find a low temperature\nexpansion of the anomalous pressure\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u03b3m3 \u03b5F kF2 + \u03b52F\n1\n\u2212\u03b5F\nP\u0303 = P\u03030 +\nT \u2212 2 exp\n(44)\n6\n6 kF2 \u03b52F\n\u03c0\nT\nThus, substituting (43) and (44) in (39) we find the proper entropy\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\nkF\n1 kF2 + \u03b52F\n\u03b3m3 V\n\u2212\u03b5F\n2\n\u03c0\n+\nS=\n\u03b5F T \u2212 exp\n6\u03c0 2\nm3 6 kF2 \u03b52F\nT\n\n(45)\n\nConsider function\nT\ng (T ) = \u03bb \u2212 exp\n\u03b5F\n8\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2212\u03b5F\nT\n\n\u0013\n(46)\n\n\fwhere\n\nkF\n1 kF2 + \u03b52F\n\u03bb=\u03c0\n+\nm3 6 kF2 \u03b52F\nThis function is negative g (T ) < 0 when\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b5F\n\u2212\u03b5F\n\u03bb<\nexp\nT\nT\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03b52F\n\n(47)\n\n(48)\n\nwhere \u03bb \u001c 1 because T \u001c \u03b5F . The dependence of critical ratio T /\u03b5F vs. \u03bb\nis given in Fig. 1. Inequality (48) is realized when \u03bb < 1/e. Parameter \u03bb\n(47) can be arbitrary small when kF \u2192 m and \u03b5F \u2192 0. Hence, function g\n(46) and the entropy S (45) will become negative at finite temperature when\nkF \u2192 m, although S = g (T ) = 0 when T \u2192 0.\nNow the definition of the entropy (45) contradicts to the laws of thermodynamics and it implies that the concept of anomalous pressure term (32) is\nnot working here. The problem is hidden in our definition of the distribution\nfunction (4) and the limits of integration (27).\n\n5\n\nDiscussion: right thermodynamical functions of tachyons\n\nWhen we calculate the thermodynamical functions of a cold Fermi gas with\nthe tachyon energy spectrum (1), the energy density (21) and pressure (22)\nmay include imaginary parts. Imaginary terms does not appear if we change\nlimits of integration (27), while an anomalous real term (32) will be added\nto pressure. This term is absolutely necessary here because the third law of\nthermodynamics must be satisfied (the entropy S = 0 at zero temperature\nT = 0). However, this term results in negative entropy of tachyon Fermi gas\nat finite temperature (45).\nThe only possible way to satisfy the third law of thermodynamics and\nto avoid imaginary quantities, is to perform integration within regular limits\nk \u2208 (0, \u221e), however, taking the tachyonic energy spectrum in the form\n\u001a \u221a\nk 2 \u2212 m2\nk\u2265m\n(49)\n\u03b5k =\n0\nk<m\nand the distribution function in the form\n\u001a\n1/ {exp [(\u03b5k \u2212 \u03bc) /T ] \u00b1 1}\nf\u03b5 =\n1\n9\n\nk\u2265m\nk<m\n\n(50)\n\n\frather than\n\u001a\nf\u03b5 =\n\n1/ {exp [(\u03b5k \u2212 \u03bc) /T ] \u00b1 1}\n0\n\nk\u2265m\nk<m\n\n(51)\n\nThus, substituting (53) in (7), we have\n\u03b3\nn= 2\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\u221e\n\nf\u03b5 k 2 dk +\n\n\u03b3 3\nm\n6\u03c0 2\n\n(52)\n\nm\n\nThe distribution function (50) of a Fermi gas at zero temperature is reduced to\n\u001a\n\u0398 (\u03b5F \u2212 \u03b5k )\nk\u2265m\nf\u03b5 =\n(53)\n1\nk<m\nSubstituting (49) and (53) in (8), (13) and (14), we find obtain the same\nenergy density (28) and pressure (29), while the anomalous term (14) vanishes\nat all.\nAccording to (52), the particle number density is determined by formula\n(20) rather than (30). As a result the entropy (9) vanishes because E +\nP \u2212 \u03b5F n = 0, and, contrary to the previous statement [6], the third law of\nthermodynamics is not violated.\nFormula (20) implies that the Fermi momentum should be defined as\nkF =\nrather than\nkF =\n\n\u0010 \u03b3n \u00111/3\n6\u03c0 2\n\n\u0010 \u03b3n\n\n\u2265m\n\n\u00111/3\n+m\n\u2265m\n\n6\u03c0 2\nand that the lowest possible particle number density is\nnmin =\n\n\u03b3 3\nm\n6\u03c0 2\n\n(54)\n\n(55)\n\n(56)\n\nrather than nmin = 0. However, these changes concern the very link between\nthe Fermi momentum kF and the particle number density n, while it is not\nreflected in the energy density and pressure, which depend only on kF without\nregard of how kF is defined. Indeed, the sound speed is determined by the\nsame formula (24), and the causality (2) is satisfied under the same condition\n10\n\n\fp\nkF \u2265 3/2m (25). The ratio P/E can exceed the unit, and all peculiar\nbehavior of cold tachyon Fermi gas [10] remains valid.\nThe only consequence of formula (52) may concern the low-temperature\nexpansion of the Fermi level [11]. Let us define dimensionless variables\nx=\n\n\u03b5k\nT\n\n\u03bc\nT\n\n\u03bb=\n\n\u03b2=\n\nm\nT\n\n(57)\n\nand write formula (52) for a Fermi-Dirac distribution function at finite temperature:\nZ\u221e p 2\nx + \u03b2 2 xdx\n\u03b3T 3\n\u03b3\nn=\n+ 2 m3\n(58)\n2\n2\u03c0\nexp (x \u2212 \u03bb) + 1 6\u03c0\n0\n\nAn arbitrary integral\nZ\u221e\nJ (\u03bb) =\n\ng (x) dx\nexp (x \u2212 \u03bb) + 1\n\n(59)\n\n0\n\nis expanded at low temperature (\u03bb \u001d 1) in the following series [11, 16]\nJ (\u03bb) = G (\u03bb) \u2212 G (0) + g 0 (\u03bb)\n\n\u03c02\n7\u03c0 4\n+ g 000 (\u03bb)\n+ ...\n6\n360\n\nSo we immediately calculate\nZ\u221e p 2\nq\nx + \u03b2 2 xdx\n1\n1\n\u03c0 2 2\u03bb2 + \u03b2 2\np\n=\n(\u03bb2 + \u03b2 2 )3 \u2212 \u03b2 3 +\nexp (x \u2212 \u03bb) + 1\n3\n3\n6 \u03bb2 + \u03b2 2\n\n(60)\n\n(61)\n\n0\n\nand, substituting (61) in (58), we obtain\nn=\n\n\u03b3 3\n\u03b3 2q 2 \u2212 m2 2\nq\n+\nT\n6\u03c0 2\n12\nq\n\nwhere\np\nq = \u03bc2 + m2\n\n\u03bc \u2212\u2192\nT \u21920\n\nq\n\n\u03b52F + m2 = kF\n\n(62)\n\n(63)\n\nTaking in to account that fact that the number of particles is conserved and\nthat the particle number density at zero temperature is defined by formula\n(20), we find\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c0 2 kF2 + \u03b52F 2\nq = kF 1 \u2212\nT\n(64)\n6\nkF4\n11\n\n\f\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c0 2 kF2 + \u03b52F 2\n\u03bc = \u03b5F 1 \u2212\n(65)\nT\n6 kF2 \u03b52F\nIt should be noted that the same expressions (64)-(65) are derived if we\nredefine the particle number density by formula (30) because the terms with\nm3 are mutually annihilated in expansion (61)-(62) . Formula (30) was used\nin our analysis of low-temperature expansion for the Fermi level of tachyon\n[11]. Thus, all previous results are valid, and the entropy and specific heat\nof tachyon Fermi gas are determined by formula [11]\n\u03b3V\n\u03b5F kF T\n(66)\n6\nThe energy density, pressure, entropy and specific heat of tachyonic excitations [12] do remain right defined.
