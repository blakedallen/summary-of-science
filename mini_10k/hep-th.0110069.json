Cederwall, B.E.W.Nilsson and D. Tsimpis: \"Spinorial cohomology...\"\n\n1. Introduction\nThe purpose of this paper is to investigate an interesting structure of supersymmetric field\ntheories, recently found when deriving conditions on interactions in maximally supersymmetric Yang\u2013Mills theory [\uf731,\uf732,\uf733]. It was observed that component fields and gauge transformations, as well as physically distinguishable deformations of the model, are represented as\nelements in cohomology classes under a certain fermionic exterior derivative. Since the model\nunder consideration, super-Yang\u2013Mills theory in D = 10, is a maximally supersymmetric\nmodel, known to possess no manifestly supersymmetric off-shell formulation, the deformations are represented (at least at the linearised level) as a current supermultiplet. In addition\nto promoting a better understanding of the mechanisms at hand for such theories, the concept turned out to be quite efficient in understanding field redefinitions relating physically\nequivalent deformations.\nThe structure we are dealing with is a sequence of representations of the global symmetry, which is the Lorentz group L (together with the R-symmetry group R if there is\none-most of the cases we deal with in the present paper have trivial R-symmetry). The\nexamples we will treat are 10-dimensional super-Yang\u2013Mills theory [\uf734], the N = (2, 0)\ntensor multiplet in D = 6 and 11-dimensional supergravity [\uf735,\uf736], the latter one both from\nthe perspective of the vielbein and from that of the three-form tensor. The treatment of\ndimensional reductions of these theories will follow from dimensional reduction of the complexes. Another case, which we expect to show similar properties, is type IIB supergravity\nin D = 10, which we will not treat in this paper. N = (1, 0) super-Yang\u2013Mills in D = 6 will\nalso be analysed, as a contrasting example of a theory possessing a supersymmetric off-shell\nformulation.\nThe basic idea is that the theories we consider are gauge theories, and that, in a superspace formulation, where all potentials and field strengths are forms on superspace, all\ncomponents except the purely spinorial ones are redundant. Since all physical fields are contained in the objects carrying spinorial form indices only, it is interesting to examine the\nstructure arising from these. Our complexes are of the form\n\u2206n\n\u22062\n\u22061\n\u22060\nn\u22121\n... ,\nrn \u2212\u2192\n. . . \u2206\u2212\u2192\nr2 \u2212\u2192\nr1 \u2212\u2192\nr0 \u2212\u2192\n\n(\uf731.\uf731)\n\nwhere rp , for some p \u2265 0, is the representation carried by a gauge transformation, rp+1 that\nof a potential and rp+2 that of a field strength. We will refer to the representations rn as\nn-forms, a notation not to be confused with that of a tensor antisymmetric in vector indices.\nThe exact definitions are given, both for gauge theory and supergravity, in the following\nsections, where it will also be clear why \u2206 is a nilpotent operator. The r\u00f4le of rp+3 is as a\nBianchi identity.\n\n\fM. Cederwall, B.E.W.Nilsson and D. Tsimpis: \"Spinorial cohomology...\"\n\n................ \uf733\n\nA supersymmetric gauge theory or a supergravity theory, when formulated on superspace, has to fulfill a number of Bianchi identities. These are of course trivial as long as field\nstrengths are defined from potentials, but become non-trivial when conventional constraints\nare imposed on the field strengths. Then one can use the Bianchi identities as integrability\nconditions and work only at the level of field strengths. For the maximally supersymmetric\ntheories we are dealing with, this procedure enforces equations of motion for the component fields, which however depend on the choice of the fermionic components of the field\nstrengths, which in a certain sense, explained in the following, play the r\u00f4les of current multiplet superfields. Since the structure we are presenting only deals with the totally fermionic\nforms, we ignore all Bianchi identities except the spinorial one. We are thus not performing\na complete analysis of the theories, for which the reader should consult other references\n[\uf731,\uf732,\uf737,\uf738,\uf739,\uf731\uf730]. The analysis of this paper demonstrates, among other things, the possibility\nof deforming the theories in a non-trivial manner by turning on field strengths. That such a\nprocedure is consistent follows from a full analysis of the Bianchi identities, which will also\nyield the exact form of the deformations. This has been done for D = 10 super-Yang\u2013Mills\n[\uf731,\uf732], while for D = 11 supergravity a partial analysis has been performed [\uf738] and a more\ncomplete one is envisaged [\uf739].\n\n2. Spinorial complexes and cohomology\nThe structure of the complex is\n\u2206n\n\u22062\n\u22061\n\u22060\nn\u22121\n...\nrn \u2212\u2192\n. . . \u2206\u2212\u2192\nr2 \u2212\u2192\nr1 \u2212\u2192\nr0 \u2212\u2192\n\n(\uf732.\uf731)\n\nwhere the representations rn at each n denotes a superfield in the representation rn of the\nLorentz group. When we describe a gauge theory, rn consists of totally symmetric and \u0393traceless tensors in n spinor indices. The fermionic exterior derivative is a projection on the\nrepresentations rn of a (symmetrised) spinorial covariant derivative. The general interpretation is that r0 contains gauge transformations, r1 contains fields and r2 deformations of\nthe theory. For a theory of a rank-(p + 1) tensor potential, such as the three-form in D = 11\nsupergravity, rp contains gauge transformations, rp+1 fields and rp+2 deformations. The representations in a complex associated with the vielbein of a supergravity theory are slightly\ndifferent. Then r0 is a vector, corresponding to reparametrisation gauge transformations, r1\nis a vector-spinor, and so on.\nIt is convenient to decompose the representations in component fields sitting at levels\nl, i.e., multiplying \u03b8l in the superfields. We write those as rnl \u2261 \u2227l S \u2297 rn , where S is the\nrepresentation of the spinorial derivative (i.e., the conjugate representation to that of \u03b8).\n\n\f\uf734 .................\n\nM.

The gauge potentials are A\u03b1 and Aa . However, the spinor potential\nalready contains a vector (of correct dimension) at the \u03b8 level, and this is the reason why a\nconventional constraint is needed in order to have one vector potential. This constraint is\n\u0393\u03b1\u03b2\na F\u03b1\u03b2 = 0 ,\n\n(\uf732.\uf736)\n\n1\nAa = \u2212 16\n(D\u0393a A \u2212 A\u0393a A) .\n\n(\uf732.\uf737)\n\nwhich implies that\n\nThe rest of F\u03b1\u03b2 ,\nF\u03b1\u03b2 =\n\n1 a1 ...a5\nJa1 ...a5\n5! \u0393\u03b1\u03b2\n\n,\n\n(\uf732.\uf738)\n\nwhich lies in (00020), does not contain Aa . We also note [\uf731\uf732,\uf731\uf733,\uf731] that part of the dimension- 23\nBianchi identity states the vanishing of the (00030) component of D\u03b1 F\u03b2\u03b3 . These observations\nmake it natural to consider, not the sequence of completely symmetric representations in\nspinor indices, but a restriction of it, namely the sequence of Spin(1,9) representations in\neq. (\uf732.\uf732). The representation rn \u2261 (000n0) is the part of the totally symmetric product\nof n chiral spinors that has vanishing \"\u0393-trace\", and may be represented tensorially as\nC\u03b11 ...\u03b1n = C(\u03b11 ...\u03b1n ) , \u0393a \u03b11 \u03b12 C\u03b11 \u03b12 \u03b13 ...\u03b1n = 0. For n = 2, C is an anti-selfdual five-form, for\nn = 3 a \u0393-traceless anti-selfdual five-form spinor, etc.\nThe operator \u2206n : rn \u2212\u2192 rn+1 can schematically be written as \u2206n Cn = \u03a0(rn+1 )DCn ,\nwhere D is the exterior covariant derivative D = d\u03b8\u03b1 D\u03b1 and \u03a0(rn ) is the algebraic projection\nfrom \u2297ns (00010) to (000n0). It is straightforward to write an explicit tensorial form for \u2206\nby subtracting \u0393-traces from DC, but it will not be used here. It is also straightforward\nto show that, for an abelian gauge group and standard flat superspace, the sequence (\uf732.\uf732)\nforms a complex, i.e., that \u22062 = 0. This follows simply from the fact that while {D\u03b1 , D\u03b2 } =\n\u2212T\u03b1\u03b2 c Dc , the torsion only has a component 2\u0393\u03b1\u03b2 c which is projected out by \u03a0(rn ). The\nanticommutator of two covariant spinor derivatives is in general\n{D\u03b1 , D\u03b2 } = \u2212T\u03b1\u03b2 c Dc \u2212 T\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b3 D\u03b3 + F\u03b1\u03b2 * +R\u03b1\u03b2* ,\n\n(\uf732.\uf739)\n\nand \u2206 will not be nilpotent in arbitrary curved backgrounds or non-abelian theories. In these\ncases, we must consider the complex for an undeformed super-Yang\u2013Mills or supergravity\n\n\f\uf736 .................\n\nM. Cederwall, B.E.W.Nilsson and D. Tsimpis: \"Spinorial cohomology...\"\n\ntheory, and consider infinitesimal deformations as elements of the cohomologies. That eq.\n(\uf732.\uf739) in the undeformed theories yield \u22062 = 0 is seen as follows. For the Yang\u2013Mills case,\nF\u03b1\u03b2 = 0 in the undeformed theory. For D = 11 supergravity the argument for \u22062 = 0 in the\nundeformed theory is slightly more complicated. One has to remember that Ta\u03b2 \u03b3 is non-zero\n(it contains the \uf734-form tensor field strength H). The torsion Bianchi identities at dimension\n1 give\nR(\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) \u03b4 = 6\u0393(\u03b1\u03b2 e T|e|\u03b3) \u03b4 ,\n(\uf732.\uf731\uf730)\nR\u03b1\u03b2c d = \u22124Tc(\u03b1\u03b3 \u0393\u03b2)\u03b3 d .\nLetting two consecutive spinorial derivatives act on an element C\u03b31 ...\u03b3n in the sequence (\uf732.\uf734)\nor C\u03b31 ...\u03b3n c in (\uf732.\uf735) gives additional curvature terms according to eq. (\uf732.\uf739). Inserting the\nexpressions for the dimension-1 curvature of eq. (\uf732.\uf731\uf730) implies that the resulting expressions\ncan be written as\nD(\u03b1 D\u03b2 C\u03b31 ...\u03b3n ) = \u0393(\u03b1\u03b2 d \u03c6|d|\u03b31 ...\u03b3n ) ,\nD(\u03b1 D\u03b2 C\u03b31 ...\u03b3n ) c = \u0393(\u03b1\u03b2 d \u03c8|d|\u03b31 ...\u03b3n ) c + \u0393c (\u03b1 \u03b4 \u03c7|\u03b4|\u03b2\u03b31 ...\u03b3n ) .\n\n(\uf732.\uf731\uf731)\n\nEach of these terms vanish under the projection on the irreducible representations constituting the complexes-while the representations rn are \"\u0393-traceless\", they contain pure\n\u0393-traces only.\nWe would now like to calculate the cohomology of the complex associated with D =\n10 super-Yang\u2013Mills. This can be done by considering the decomposition into irreducible\nrepresentations of the representation sitting at level l in rn , rnl \u2261 \u2227l S \u2297 rn . This is easily\ndone, e.g. with the help of the program LiE [\uf731\uf734]. One then follows each of the irreducible\nrepresentations at a given dimension through the subcomplex\n1\nr0l \u2192 r1l\u22121 \u2192 r2l\u22122 \u2192 . . . \u2192 rl\u22121\n\u2192 rl .\n\n(\uf732.\uf731\uf732)\n\nLet us illustrate the calculation by examining the field content. We then look into the\nspinor potential of dimension 12 , which contains all fields in the vector multiplet, so we\nshould examine the first cohomology. The vector (dimension 1) sits at l = 21 and the spinor\n(dimension 32 ) at l = 1. The subcomplexes under consideration are r02 \u2192 r11 \u2192 r2 and\nr03 \u2192 r12 \u2192 r21 \u2192 r3 . Checking the multiplicities of the relevant representations, (10000)\nand (00001), in these, we obtain the sequences 0 \u2192 1 \u2192 0 and 0 \u2192 1 \u2192 0 \u2192 0. The\ncomponents of the cohomology in these representations and dimensions clearly contain the\nphysical fields. This can be understood in a traditional framework as removing degrees\nof freedom in a superfield gauge transformation (removing the image from the left) and\nimposing the vanishing of the field strength F\u03b1\u03b2 (removing the complement of the kernel\n\n\fM. Cederwall, B.E.W.Nilsson and D. Tsimpis: \"Spinorial cohomology...\"\n\n................ \uf737\n\nfrom the right). Analogous considerations tell us that the second cohomology contains a\nspinor of dimension 52 and a vector of dimension 3. These are interpreted as belonging to a\ncurrent supermultiplet, i.e., fields entering the right hand sides of the equations of motion.\nThis goes well together with the observation that modifications of the theory are introduced\nby deforming the constraint F\u03b1\u03b2 = 0 [\uf731\uf732,\uf731\uf735,\uf731\uf736,\uf731,\uf732]. The relevance of the cohomology is\nexplained by the facts that deformations introduced by relaxing F\u03b1\u03b2 = 0 have to fulfill the\nBianchi identity (removing the complement of the kernel from the right), and that relevant\ndeformations are counted modulo field redefinitions (removing the image from the left). See\nalso the following section for a fuller discussion.\nA complete calculation of the cohomology requires that one considers all irreducible representations occurring at arbitrary levels. This quickly becomes untractable to do by hand.\nUnfortunately, there is also another complication, that makes it impossible to derive the\ncohomologies unambiguously from multiplicities only without making further assumptions.\nThis can be exemplified by looking at some other representation; let us take the \uf733-form at\ndimension 3. The subcomplex r06 \u2192 r15 \u2192 r24 \u2192 r33 \u2192 r42 \u2192 r51 \u2192 r6 yields the multiplicities\n0 \u2192 0 \u2192 1 \u2192 1 \u2192 0 \u2192 0 \u2192 0. We do not expect any non-zero cohomology, since there is\nno equation of motion in this representation. Yet, the sequence of multiplicities offers two\npossibilities: either there is one \uf733-form in the first cohomology and one in the second, or\nthere is none at all. Using tensorial methods, it is easy to show that the \uf733-form in r24 has an\nimage in r33 , so the cohomology vanishes. In the present paper, we will make the assumption\nof \"maximal propagation\" of irreducible representations through the subcomplexes, meaning\nthat representations have images or belong to images under \u2206 if possible. This assumption\nis enough to determine the super-Yang\u2013Mills cohomology completely, at least for n \u2264 5. The\nresult, derived already in ref. [\uf731], is presented in table \uf731. We expect higher cohomologies to\nvanish. The method for calculating cohomologies, under the assumption of maximal propagation, is by using the code of appendix A with the program LiE [\uf731\uf734]. As we will see, there\nare cases in D = 11 where even the assumptions made so far leave an ambiguity. The reason\nthat we choose to make educated guesses rather than turn to tensor calculations is that the\nnumber of irreducible representations is so large that such a treatment becomes virtually\nimpossible.\nWe now turn to the cohomology of the complex (\uf732.\uf735) associated with the super-vielbein\nof D = 11 supergravity. All fields in the supergravity multiplet are contained in the dimension-(\u2212 21 ) vielbein E\u03b1 a (actually in the \u0393-traceless part (10001)), which plays an analogous\nr\u00f4le to that of A\u03b1 in super-Yang\u2013Mills theory. All other components should be related to\nthis one by conventional constraints. When one considers the corresponding field strength,\nthe dimension-0 torsion component T\u03b1\u03b2 a , it is known [\uf731\uf737,\uf731\uf738,\uf731\uf739,\uf738] that the only components\nsurviving after imposing conventional constraints are the usual constant \u0393-matrix term, and\n\n\f\uf738 .................\n\nM.

(\uf732.\uf739), there are higher order torsion terms that should be added to this\nequation, which do not contribute to the relevant representations for infinitesimal deformations). We are naturally led to consider the sequence of representations already stated in eq.\n(\uf732.\uf735).\nThe cohomology is given in table \uf733, but we would like to illustrate part of the calculation.\nThe representations in the zeroth and first cohomologies are calculated the same way as\nfor super-Yang\u2013Mills. When we come to the second cohomology, representing the current\nsupermultiplet contained in the torsion components (11000) and (10002) at dimension 0\n[\uf738], there is a complication illustrated by the following example. Take the spinor (00001) at\ndimension 32 . It will occur in the equation of motion for the gravitino, if it is contained in\nthe n = 2 cohomology (that this is the case, and that it does not affect the Weyl curvature\nat dimension 23 , was actually shown in ref. [\uf738]). We now only write the multiplicity of the\nrepresentation in each rnl , and get the sequence 1 \u2192 3 \u2192 3 \u2192 0 \u2192 0 \u2192 0. This sequence\noffers two distinct possibilities even under the assumption of maximal propagation: either\nthe representation in r0 has an image among the three in r1 , in which case there is a\ncohomology in r2 , or all three representations in r2 have images in r3 , in which case there\nis a cohomology in r0 . In this specific case, tensorial methods have already been used [\uf738]\nthat show that the first of these possibilities is true, so that the second cohomology contains\na spinor in the equations of motion. The r\u00f4le of the code given in appendix A is that it\nmakes use of the assumption of maximal propagation, and in cases like the one just related,\ngives candidate cohomologies in all possible cases. For the cohomologies associated with\nthe D = 11 super-vielbein and super-\uf733-form, such ambiguities exist when one goes higher\nin dimension than those of the fields, and the results of tables \uf733 and \uf734 consist partially\nof educated guesses concerning which alternatives are the correct ones. We are led in part\nby expectations concerning the content of the current supermultiplet and in part by the\nresulting symmetry of the tables-all three cohomologies in 10 and 11 dimensions seem to\nhave an inherent symmetry under reflection in one point (in the D = 10 case accompanied\nby a Z2 automorphism exchanging the spinor representations of Spin(1,9)).\n\n\fM.

The meaning of the cohomologies\nThe maximally supersymmetric theories we are considering have the property that imposing\nthe vanishing of certain lowest-dimensional field strengths, (J and the X tensors) implies the\nequations of motion. This is related to the non-vanishing second cohomology. The second\ncohomology contains a current supermultiplet, that enters the field equations implied by the\nwhole set of Bianchi identities (that we do not consider in this paper). If the constraints for\nthe field strengths are changed, the equations of motion change.\nTo understand this, suppose for a moment that those cohomologies vanished. Then,\nwhatever constraint was put upon the field strengths (consistent with the Bianchi identities)\ncould be expressed as the image of an exterior derivative acting on a \uf731-form (a potential).\nSuch a field strength could be removed by a field redefinition, and the system would be\nequivalent to one where those field strength components were set to zero. One might ask\nwhether it is not inconsistent to treat the field strength as belonging to the cohomology, since\nit is supposed to be derived from a potential, and in that sense cohomologically trivial. In\nfact, what the remaining Bianchi identities do is to resolve the cohomology in the sense that\nthe field strength indeed comes from a potential. This is achieved by the equations of motion.\nTake e.g. the equation of motion for the spinor \u03bb in super-Yang\u2013Mills. In the undeformed\ncase it reads D\n/ \u03bb = 0. When deformations are turned on, it will read D\n/ \u03bb = \u03bc, and if \u03bc is\nderived from a cohomologically trivial J, \u03bc will be of the form \u03bc = D\n/ \u03bd. Then the equation of\nmotion for \u03bb is modified in a trivial way, removable by \u03bb\u2212\u03bd \u2192 \u03bb. Only if J is cohomologically\nnon-trivial do the equations of motion receive significant modifications. Once the equations\nof motion are taken into account, they state exactly the integrability of the field strength to\na potential (in the example that \u03bc is D\n/ on something). So, the cohomology is resolved by\nthe field equations, but if it was trivial from the beginning, nothing would have changed.\nIt is instructive to compare with a non-maximally supersymmetric gauge theory known\nto possess an off-shell superfield formulation. Take the N = (1, 0) super-Yang\u2013Mills theory\nin D = 6 [\uf732\uf730]. This theory has an off-shell formulation in terms of the vector, the spinor and\na triplet of auxiliary scalars of dimension 2.

The second cohomology is trivial, which also is\nexpected-setting F\u03b1\u03b2 to zero does not put the theory on-shell, and the value of F\u03b1\u03b2 does\nnot contain any information about interactions-it can be set to zero by a field redefinition.\nIt should be noted that even if this picture is quite clear for both D = 10 super-Yang\u2013\nMills and D = 11 supergravity, no explicit such understanding has been achieved for a\nformulation of D = 11 supergravity based on the super-\uf733-form. We comment more on this\nbelow.\nThere is a striking resemblance [\uf732\uf731] between spinorial cohomology as it is constructed\nin this paper and the BRST cohomology in Berkovits' covariant formulation of superstrings\nusing pure spinors [\uf732\uf732]. It seems as the choice of representations building our complexes\namounts to the same information encoded in the contraction of the spinor derivative into\na pure spinor. Further investigation of this similarity, as well as the relation to the pure\nspinors of ref. [\uf731\uf733] should be pursued.\nReading the tables of cohomologies, a number of observations can be made. Starting\nwith the super-Yang\u2013Mills case, table \uf731, the interpretation is clear. The gauge transformations (zeroth cohomology) and fields (first cohomology) are the usual ones, and the second\ncohomology in the field strength contains exactly the representations fitting into the right\nhand sides of equations of motion for the spinor and vector. This case has been worked\nout in full detail [\uf731]. The only element of the cohomology that has not yet been explained\nis the scalar of dimension \uf734 in the third cohomology. It has the correct dimension for a\nlagrangian density, and we suspect that it might be related to an action principle containing\nthe deformation of the theory (not the ordinary kinetic terms).\nIn table \uf732, the picture is similar. The first cohomology contains the gauge transformations, the second one the five scalars, the antisymmetric tensor and the two spinors, while\nthe third cohomology carries the representations of the currents: an (anti-)selfdual tensor\ngiving the selfduality of the \uf733-form field strength, spinors of the opposite chirality and five\nscalars, all at appropriate dimensions.\nTurning to table \uf733, and the D = 11 supergravity, the zeroth cohomology clearly represents the bosonic and fermionic reparametrisations. In the first cohomology, we find the\nfields: at dimension 0 the (linearised) metric, at dimension 21 the gravitino in (10001) and\nat dimension 1 the \uf734-form field strength. In addition, there is a spinor at dimension 21 and\na vector at dimension 1. The experience from solving superspace Bianchi identities for this\nsystem [\uf737,\uf738,\uf732\uf733] tells us that these should be identified with the spinor and vector components\nof the Weyl connection \uf731-form\u2217 . The second cohomology contains the representations for the\n\u2217\n\nAlthough we use a superspace that does not have Weyl scalings as part of its structure group, we refer\nto these as Weyl connections, since they appear in the torsion in exactly the places where they could\nbe absorbed in a Weyl connection by a conventional constraint.\n\n\fM.

Since the latter one, due to gauge invariance,\nappears in the geometry only through its field strength, one also finds its Bianchi identity\nin (00002) here. In addition there are the representations (01000) \u2295 (10000) at dimension\n2. One of the controversies over the possible deformations of the eleven-dimensional supergravity theory concerns the r\u00f4le of the Weyl connections. It has been conjectured that the\ncorresponding curvatures vanish, so that the they are integrable to a scalar field, the Weyl\ncompensator, that can be removed by a conventional constraint [\uf737,\uf738], but also that they\nshould play a significant r\u00f4le in a deformed theory [\uf732\uf733]. In ref. [\uf738], we found evidence for\nthe first of these alternatives in the fact that the spinor at dimension 23 affects only the\ngravitino equation of motion, not the Weyl curvature\u2020 . This of course does not follow from\nthe present listing of representations, but requires exact solution of the Bianchi identities. It\nwas also found that the dimension-1 part of the Weyl curvature, G\u03b1\u03b2 , vanished, which looks\nnatural in the absence of any such cohomology. In the undeformed theory, all components\nof the Weyl curvature vanish, but this has not been completely shown in a theory with\ndeformation by the X-tensors. We see that there a priori is room in the second cohomology\nfor a modification to the dimension-2 Weyl curvature Gab in (01000), but a treatment of the\nfull set of Bianchi identities [\uf739] has to be awaited to determine whether it is actually there.\nFrom the present analysis, it is also not ruled out that there might be corrections to the\nBianchi identity for the \uf734-form field strength. Concerning the vector at dimension 2 we do\nnot have any natural interpretation, and find it plausible that it goes away when the full set\nof Bianchi identities is considered.\nTable \uf734, containing the cohomologies for an antisymmetric tensor in D = 11 (the\ndimensions are adapted to a \uf733-form potential), gives some new information. We are used to\nthe fact that the tensor field arises in a superspace formulation from super-geometry only,\nso that the \uf734-form field strength sits inside the torsion at dimension 1, and that the closed\nsuper-\uf734-form is constructed out of geometrical data. The present analysis indicates that it is\npossible to turn this around, and see the geometry as arising from the dynamics of a super\uf733-form potential. It was observed in ref. [\uf738] that the super-\uf734-form, once the deformations are\nturned on, is forced to have non-vanishing components at negative dimensions. Here we will\nargue that these actually can encode the deformations, and that this implies integrability\nconditions on the X-tensors, not readily visible from the geometrical analysis but presumably\nhidden therein.\nThe appearance of components at negative dimension immediately gives rise to questions concerning propagation of branes and BPS conditions in deformed backgrounds. Components of negative dimension in the brane Wess\u2013Zumino terms have no counterpart in the\nkinetic term, which complicates the issue of \u03ba-symmetry [\uf732\uf734]. Our opinion is that the nature\n\u2020\n\nIn that analysis, only the X -tensor in (10002), not the one in (11000), was included for simplicity.\n\n\f\uf731\uf736 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nM. Cederwall, B.E.W.Nilsson and D. Tsimpis: \"Spinorial cohomology...\"\n\nof \u03ba-symmetry has to be changed in a deformed theory, so that the local transformation\nparameter \u03ba, seen as a vector field on superspace, will have a non-vanishing Lorentz vector\npart. In the embedding formalism [\uf731\uf738], this would manifest itself as a deformation of the\nembedding constraint.\nIn the second cohomology, representing gauge transformations with parameter \u039b\u03b1\u03b2 in\n(01000) \u2295 (00002), we find the \uf732-form gauge transformation for the tensor field as well as\nbosonic and fermionic reparametrisations. In the third cohomology, all the supergravity\nfields are contained in the potential C\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 in (01001) \u2295 (00003): at dimension 0 the \uf733-form\npotential and the graviton, and at dimension 21 the gravitino. In addition, there is a scalar at\ndimension 0 and a spinor at dimension 12 . A tentative interpretation is that they represent\nthe Weyl compensator and the spinorial Weyl connection. The fourth cohomology, sitting\nin the superfield H\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 in (02000) \u2295 (01002) \u2295 (00004), contains equations of motion for\nthe gravitino, for the metric and for the \uf733-form, and no extra representations. Since now\nthe \uf733-form appears directly, and not via its field strength, there is no need for its Bianchi\nidentity in the fourth cohomology. We observe that there is room neither for the vectorial\nWeyl connection not for its field strength. There is still a possibility for an equation of\nmotion for the spinor to mix in with the spinor part of the gravitino equation of motion, but\nin the light of what the geometrical analysis shows (see the previous paragraph) this seems\nvery unlikely.\nIt would be very interesting to analyse the D = 11 supergravity from the point of view\nof the \uf733-form instead of the super-geometry. How this is done at a linearised level is obvious,\nbut how a full treatment should be performed without invoking geometry is completely\nunclear, although the present analysis indicates that it might be possible. Such an approach\nmight offer new perspectives on M-theory, and we hope to be able to investigate it in the\nfuture. One question that can be addressed in a traditional treatment is whether or not the\nrequirement that there exist a closed superspace \uf734-form puts stronger restrictions on the\nsystem than does a purely geometric analysis. We are primarily aiming at the controversy\nabout the fields connected to Weyl scalings. Our guess is that the two approaches should be\nequivalent, and that the Bianchi identities of higher dimensions not considered in this paper\nenforce triviality of the Weyl bundle, as shown in ref. [\uf737] for the undeformed theory and\nconjectured in ref. [\uf738] for the deformed theory. If this statement is true, the \uf733-form approach\nmay actually offer some advantages over the geometric picture, since it encodes the twostep integrability of the X-tensors to the three irreducible representations in H\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 (this\nintegrability goes in another direction than the complex for the super-vielbein), something\nthat may be very useful when one wants to express these in terms of physical fields in\nthe supergravity multiplet to get explicit \u03b1\u2032 -corrections from supersymmetry. We believe\nthat although the attempts made so far [\uf738] have only been partially successful, due to the\ntechnical complexity of the calculations, a heavier use of computer techniques [\uf731\uf734,\uf732\uf735] will\nrender the investigations [\uf739] tractable.\n\nAcknowledgements: MC wants to thank Itzhak Bars, Eric Bergshoeff, Loriano Bonora and\nKellogg Stelle for discussions and comments.
