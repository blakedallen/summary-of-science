A poorly determined original position resulted in no\ncertain identification of the remnant (Duerbeck 1987), which\nwas designated IM Nor. A second eruption in January 2002\n(Liller 2002) showed that IM Nor is in fact a recurrent nova\nand the improved accuracy of position enabled the pre-nova\nto be identified as a star with variations in brightness around\nV \u223c 18 (Kato et al. 2002). The eruption light curve derived\nby Kato et al. led them to conclude that although it is indeed like T Pyx, a better comparison may be made with CI\nAql, which is another recurrent nova. The spectra obtained\nduring outburst show that all of these stars resemble each\nother in having strong Fe II emission and late appearance\nof forbidden lines (Kato et al. 2002; Duerbeck et al. 2003).\nKato et al. proposed that CI Aql and IM Nor form a distinct\nsubclass with massive ejecta and long recurrence intervals.\nAt maximum light IM Nor reached V \u223c 7.8 and decayed\nas a fast nova with t2 \u223c 20 d. The eruption amplitude of \u223c\n10 mag agrees with that expected for a fast nova of low orbital inclination (see Fig. 5.4 of Warner 1995). However, CI\nAql also showed such an initial steep fall, but this was succeeded by a long-lived phase of slow decline (Matsumoto et\nal. 2001), uncharacteristic of a fast nova. IM Nor is behaving\nsimilarly, so in neither case can the usual Amplitude/Rate\nof Decline/Inclination relationship be trusted. CI Aql is an\neclipsing system with a period of 14.8 h (Mennickent & Honeycutt 1995).\nIM Nor is currently at V \u223c 16.5 and is thus still far\nfrom its quiescent magnitude. We have observed it photo-\n\n\u22c6 E-mail: pwoudt@circinus.ast.uct.ac.za\n\u2020 E-mail: warner@physci.uct.ac.za\nc 0000 RAS\n\nmetrically with good time resolution in order to look for any\norbital modulation.\n\n2\n\nPHOTOMETRIC OBSERVATIONS\n\nOur observations were made in white light using the UCT\nCCD Photometer (O'Donoghue 1995) attached to the 40-in\nreflector at the Sutherland site of the South African Astronomical Observatory. The observing log is given in Table 1\nand the reduced light curves are shown in Figure 1.\nIM Nor has a clear periodic brightness modulation with\na range of \u223c 0.3. The mean brightness of the system varies\nby at least 0.1 mag from night to night, and can vary by\nthat amount over a few hours. The dominant feature is an\neclipse-like recurrent dip, with a depth of 0.2 mag, from\nwhich a period of 2.462 h is derived. The ephemeris for this\ndip is\nHJDmin = 245 2696.526 + 0.1026(\u00b11) E.\n\n(1)\n\nInterpreted as an orbital period, the modulation at\n2.462 h places IM Nor towards the low end of the range\nof orbital periods for novae and squarely in the centre of\nthe 'period gap' that exists for dwarf novae (but probably\nnot for novae: Warner (2002)). Of the nine known recurrent\nnovae only T Pyx (Porb = 1.83 h) and IM Nor have orbital\nperiods at the lower end.\nIn the Fourier transforms of individual nights, and the\nwhole data set, no periods other than the 2.462 h modulation\nand its harmonics were found.\n\n3\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe width of the main brightness dip is too large for it to\nbe the eclipse of an accretion disc (or of the primary, even\nthough possibly bloated by the effects of the recent eruption). To assist in interpretation we examine the light curve\n\n\f2\n\nPatrick A. Woudt and Brian Warner\n\nTable 1.

The whole of this feature cannot of\ncourse be an eclipse \u2013 it is impossibly wide. We suggest that\nthe light curve is that resulting from a moderate reflection\neffect from the secondary \u2013 irradiated by the very hot primary left after eruption. This produces a single hump per\norbital period, and the minimum of the reflection effect may\nbe pulled even lower by partial eclipse of the accretion disc\nby the secondary at that phase.\n\nFigure 2.

But in IM Nor there is the additional occurrence of a\ndip between maxima, with its minimum close to phase 0.5,\nwhich creates the rise of brightness seen before the onset\nof the major dip. This asymmetric feature may be a secondary eclipse caused by partial obscuration of the brightly\nlit hemisphere of the secondary by the optically thick accretion disc and the accretion stream. We have previously\ndrawn attention to the possibility of such an effect in systems with strongly irradiated secondaries, and that such an\neffect might be weakly present in the nova remnant DD Cir\n(Woudt & Warner 2003).\nThe short orbital period for IM Nor requires another\nmodel to be explored. At this period, and with the high\nrate of mass transfer expected for a recent nova, which is\nirradiating its secondary, the accretion disc may be excited\ninto an elliptical shape and the observed recurrent humps\ncould be due to superhumps (Warner 1995). The observed\namplitude of 0.3 mag is compatible with a superhump, but at\nthat amplitude superhumps seen in dwarf nova outbursts are\nusually triangular in profile. The superhumps seen in other\nrecent novae of short period, namely V1794 Cyg (Retter,\nLeibowitz & Ofek 1997), DD Cir (Woudt & Warner 2003),\nV4633 Sgr (Lipkin et al. 2001), have much lower amplitudes\n(\u223c 0.05 mag). IM Nor has at least 1.5 mag of decaying nova\nluminosity added to its quiescent brightness, which should\nresult in dilution of any superhump modulation. We note\nthat the basic profile of the modulation remains roughly\nsymmetrical about minimum light: i.e., there is no sign of a\nsuperhump drifting relative to an orbital eclipse as seen in\nsome nova remnants (e.g. RR Cha: Woudt & Warner 2002).\nWe conclude that the modulation seen in IM Nor is unlikely\nto be due to superhumps.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nPAW is supported by funds made available from the National Research Foundation and by strategic funds made\navailable to BW from the University of Cape Town.
