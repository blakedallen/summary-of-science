P \u03be is known as \"infinite Bernoulli convolution\". Measures of this form have been studied since 1930's from the pure\nprobabilistic point of view as well as for their applications in harmonic analysis, dynamical systems and fractal analysis. We will not describe in details\nthe history of the investigation of these measures, paper [13] contains a comprehensive survey on Bernoulli convolutions, corresponding historical notes\nand brief discussion of some applications, generalizations and problems.\nLet S\u22a5 be the set of those \u03bb \u2208 [ 12 ; 1) for which the random variable \u03be\nhas singular distribution, and let S\u226a be the set of those \u03bb \u2208 ( 21 ; 1) for which\nthe measure P \u03be is absolutely continuous (with respect to Lebesgue measure\nL). In 1939 P. Erd\u00f6s [5] proved that \u03bb \u2208 S\u22a5 whenever \u03bb is the reciprocal of\na Pisot number in (1; 2). Up to now we do not know any other examples\nof \u03bb belonging to S\u22a5 . In 1940 P. Erd\u00f6s proved the existence a number a\nindependent of \u03bb such that almost all \u03bb from (a; 1) belong to S\u226a . In 1962\nA. Garsia [6] found the largest explicitly described subset of S\u226a known up\nto now. Garsia formulated the following conjecture: almost all \u03bb \u2208 [ 12 ; 1)\nbelong to S\u226a . This conjecture was proved by B.Solomyak[19] in 1995, a\nsimpler proof was found by Y. Peres and B.Solomyak in [14]. In [15] a more\ngeneral nonsymmetric model was considered by Y. Peres and B.Solomyak:\nif the \u03bek in (1) take values \u22121 and +1 with probabilities 1 \u2212 p and p (p \u2208\n[ 31 ; 32 ])correspondingly, then almost all \u03bb from [pp (1 \u2212p)(1\u2212p) ; 1) belong to S\u226a .\nThe main goal of this paper is to investigate the distributions of the\nfollowing random variables which are generalizations of the Benoulli convolutions:\n\u221e\nP\n1) \u03c8 =\n\u03c8k \u03bbk ,where \u03bb \u2208 (0; 1), and \u03c8k are independent not necessarily\nk=1\n\nindentically distributed random variables taking the values 0 resp.1 with\nprobabilities p0k resp. p1k , i.e., schematicall\u1e8f:\n\u03c8k 0\n1\n,\np0k p1k\n2\n\n\fwith pik \u2265 0, p0k + p1k = 1.\n\u221e\nP\n2)\u03c6 =\n\u03c6k ak ,where \u03c6k are independent random variables with the folk=1\n\nlowing distributions\n\n\u03c6k 0\n1\n,\np0k p1k\n\npik \u2265 0, p0k + p1k = 1, and ak \u2265 0 are terms of a convergence series\n\n\u221e\nP\n\nak .\n\nk=1\n\nThe main method we use is the method of image measures which are\nnonlinear projections of infinite product measures. In section 2 we consider\nan infinite product measure spaces and the problem of absolute continuity,\nsingularity and discreteness of the product measures. Section 3 is devoted to\nmeasure preserving mappings f acting from a probability space (\u03a9, F, \u03bc)into\na probability space (\u03a9\u2217 , F \u2217 , \u03bc\u2217) , where \u03bc\u2217 = \u03bc(f \u22121). Conditions on f , under which f preserves the relations \"to be singular\" and \"to be absolutely\ncontinuous\" between measures defined on (\u03a9, F ) and corresponding image\nmeasures, are investigated.\nIn section 4, by using the results of sections 2 and 3, we prove a slightly\nsharpened versions of the results of B.Solomyak[19] ,and Y.Peres and B.\nSolomyak [15]. We also consider an counterexample concerning a problem\nwhich was formulated in section 3.\nSection 5 is devoted to the study of metric, fractal and topological properties of the distribution of the above mentioned random variable \u03c6. We prove\ncriteria for singularity and absolutely continuity of the distribution of the\n\u221e\nP\nr.v. \u03c6 in the case, when ak \u2265\nai .\ni=k+1\n\n2\n\nInfinite product measure spaces and absolutely continuity of product measures.\n\nLet us consider an independent sequence of probability spaces {(\u03a9k , Ak , \u03bck )}.\nWe will denote by (\u03a9, A, \u03bc) the infinite product of the probability spaces\n(\u03a9k , Ak , \u03bck ) :\n\u221e\nY\n(\u03a9, A, \u03bc) =\n(\u03a9k , Ak , \u03bck ) .\nk=1\n\n3\n\n\fFor any element \u03c9 = (\u03c91 , \u03c92 , ..., \u03c9k , ...) \u2208 \u03a9 we have\n\u03bc(\u03c9) =\n\n\u221e\nY\n\n\u03bck (\u03c9k ), \u03c9k \u2208 \u03a9k .\n\nk=1\n\nTheorem 1. \u03bc is pure discrete if and only if\n\u221e\nY\n\nk=1\n\nProof. If\n\u221e\nQ\n\n\u221e\nQ\n\nmax \u03bck (\u03c9k ) > 0.\n\n(2)\n\n\u03c9k \u2208\u03a9k\n\nmax \u03bck (\u03c9k ) = 0, then for any point \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 we have \u03bc(\u03c9) \u2264\n\nk=1 \u03c9k \u2208\u03a9k\n\nmax pik = 0. Therefore, condition 2 is necessary for discreteness of the\nmeasure \u03bc.\nTo prove the sufficiency we consider a subset A+ \u2282 \u03a9 :\n)\n(\n\u221e\nY\n\u03bck (\u03c9k ) > 0 .\nA+ = \u03c9 : \u03bck (\u03c9k ) > 0 and\nk=1 i\u2208\u03a9k\n\nk=1\n\nThe set A+ consists of the points \u03c9 = (\u03c91 , \u03c92 , ..., \u03c9k , ...) such that \u03bck (\u03c9k ) >\n0 and condition \u03bck (\u03c9k ) 6= max \u03bck (\u03c9k ) holds only for finite numbers of values\n\u03c9k \u2208\u03a9k\n\nk. It easy to see that the set A+ is at most countable and the event \"\u03c9 \u2208 A+ \"\ndoes not depend on any finite coordinates of \u03c9. Therefore, by using the \"0\nand 1\" theorem of Kolmogorov, we conclude that \u03bc(A+ ) = 0 or \u03bc(A+ ) = 1.\nSince the set A+ contains the point \u03c9 \u2217 such that \u03bck (\u03c9k\u2217) = max \u03bck (\u03c9k ), we\n\u03c9k \u2208\u03a9k\n\nhave \u03bc(A+ ) \u2265 \u03bc(\u03c9 \u2217) > 0. Thus, \u03bc(A+ ) = 1, which proves the discreteness of\nthe measure \u03bc. \u0003\n\u221e\nQ\nLet (\u03a9, A, \u03bd) =\n(\u03a9k , Ak , \u03bdk ) such that the measure \u03bdk is absolutely\nk=1\n\ncontinuous with respect to the measure \u03bck (for short \u03bdk \u226a \u03bck ) for all k \u2208 N.\nBy using completely analog arguments as in [9], one can prove the following\nsharper variant of the Kakutani theorem.\nTheorem 2 Let \u03bdk be absolutely continuous with respect to the measure\n\u03bck .

If f is a bijective mapping, then A = f \u22121 [f (A)] and \u03b7(A) =\n\u03b7 \u2217 (f (A)). Using the same arguments, we have \u03c4 (A) = \u03c4 \u2217 (f (A)) for all measurable subsets A \u2282 \u03a9.\nTo prove the first statement of the theorem it is sufficient to prove that\nthe condition \u03b7 \u2217 \u226a \u03c4 \u2217 implies the condition \u03b7 \u226a \u03c4.

If there exists a measurable subset \u03a90 \u2282 \u03a9 such that \u03b7(\u03a90 ) =\n\u03c4 (\u03a90 ) = 0 and the mapping f : (\u03a9\\\u03a90 ) \u2192 \u03a9\u2217 is a bijection, then\n\u03b7 \u226a \u03c4 if and only if \u03b7 \u2217 \u226a \u03c4 \u2217 ,\n\u03b7 \u22a5 \u03c4 if and only if \u03b7 \u2217 \u22a5 \u03c4 \u2217 .\nProof.

Since\nf : (\u03a9\\\u03a90 ) \u2192 [0; 1] is a bijective mapping, we conclude that f \u22121 [f (A)] =\nA \u222a A0 , where A0 \u2282 \u03a90 . Therefore,\nand\n\n\u03b7(A) = \u03b7(A \u222a A0 ) = \u03b7(f \u22121 [f (A)]) = \u03b7 \u2217 (f (A)),\n\u03c4 (A) = \u03c4 \u2217 (f (A)).\n\nWe complete the proof by arguments which are completely similar to\nthose used in the proof of the previous theorem. \u0003\n\n4\n\nGeneralized Bernoulli convolutions I\n\nLet us consider a random variables\n\u03c8=\n\n\u221e\nX\nk=1\n\n6\n\n\u03c8k \u03bbk ,\n\n\fwhere \u03bb \u2208 (0; 1), and \u03c8k are independent not necessarily indentically distributed random variables with the following distributions\n\u03c8k 0\n1\n,\np0k p1k\nwith pik \u2265 0, p0k + p1k = 1.\nTheorem 7.

To obtain a contradiction we suppose that the condition\n\u03b4k > 1 holds for infinitely many number of k, but there exist an closed interval\n[\u03b1\u2217 ; \u03b2 \u2217 ] such that [\u03b1\u2217 ; \u03b2 \u2217 ] \u2282 S \u03c6 .

Let us prove that \u03b1 6= 0. If we\nsuppose that \u03b1 = 0 , then we should conclude that [0; \u03b2] \u2282 S \u03c6 . We can choose\n10\n\n\fa number k1 such that ak1 < \u03b2 and ak1 > rk1 .

In a similar way we prove that \u03b2 6= 1. Since S \u03c6 is a perfect set,\nfrom the construction of the set [\u03b1; \u03b2] there follows the existence of a positive\nnumber \u03b50 such that both of the intervals (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b50 ; \u03b1) and (\u03b2; \u03b2 + \u03b50 ) do not\ncontain any points from the support S \u03c6 .

By using theorem 2, we conclude that the measure \u03bd is\n2 0k\n2 1k\nabsolute continuous with respect to measure \u03bc if and only if\n!\nr\nr\n\u221e\nY\n1\n1\np0k +\np1k < \u221e.\n(14)\n2\n2\nk=1\n\n12\n\n\fIt is easy to check that the product (14) converges if and only if condition\n(13) holds.\nLet us consider a mapping g : \u03a9 \u2192 [0; 1] defined as follows: for any\n\u03c9 = (\u03c91 \u03c92 . . . \u03c9k . . .) \u2208 \u03a9,\ng(\u03c9) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03c9k ak .\n\n(15)\n\nk=1\n\nIt is easy to see that g is a measurable mapping. Moreover, g is bijective,\nsince \u03b4k > 1 holds for all k \u2208 N. The image measure \u03bc\u2217 = \u03bc(g \u22121) is a\nprobability measure which is uniformly distributed on the support S \u03c6 of\npositive Lebesgue measure L(S \u03c6 ) > 0, i.e., for all Borel subset E \u2282 [0; 1] we\nhave\nL(E \u2229 S \u03c6 )\n\u03bc\u2217 (E) =\n.\nL(S \u03c6 )\nThe image measure \u03bd \u2217 = \u03bd(g \u22121 ) is the distribution of the random variable\n\u03c6. Since g is a bijective mapping, the measure \u03bd \u2217 is absolutely continuous\nwith respect to the measure \u03bc\u2217 if and only if the measure \u03bd is absolutely\ncontinuous with respect to the measure \u03bc. Since \u03bc\u2217 \u226a L, we conclude that\nthe measure \u03bd \u2217 is absolute continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure if\nand only if both (12) and (13) hold.\nThe criterium for discreteness follows from the Levi theorem [10] or can\nbe deduced as a corollary from theorem 1 and the bijectivity of g.\nAssertion 3) follows from the purity of the distribution of the r.v. \u03c6. \u0003\nAcknowledgment\nThis work was partly supported by DFG 436 UKR 113/53, INTAS 00257, SFB-611 projects and by DAAD.
