Like Brownian motion, it is a simple random\nobject of widespread application and great intrinsic beauty. It plays an important role in statistical physics and the theory of random surfaces, particularly in the case d = 2. It is also a starting point for many constructions in\nquantum field theory [FFS92, GK83, GJ87].\nThe main purpose of this paper is to provide a mostly self-contained mathematical introduction to the GFF for readers familiar with basic probability\n(Gaussian variables, \u03c3-algebras, Brownian motion, etc.), but not necessarily\nversed in the language of quantum field theory or conformal field theory. We\nwill review the classical continuum constructions (Dirichlet quadratic forms,\nabstract Wiener spaces, Gaussian Hilbert spaces, Schwinger functions, chaos\ndecomposition, etc.) and assemble basic facts about discrete Gaussian free\nfields.\nSeveral results from this paper are cited in a recent work by the author and\nSchramm, which studies contour lines of the discrete Gaussian free field and\nshows that their scaling limits are forms of the Schramm-Loewner evolution\nSLE4 [SS]. We also expect these facts to be cited in forthcoming work relating\nSLE\u03ba to the GFF for other values of \u03ba.\nAlthough [SS] is a long and technical work, it contains an elementary\ntwenty-page introduction with many additional references to the history of\nthe contour line problem and many other pointers to the physics literature.\nTo avoid duplicating this effort, we will not discuss SLE at any length here.\nWe also will not discuss the Virasoro algebra or the use of the GFF in the\nCoulomb gas theory (topics discussed at length in several reference texts,\nincluding [Car90, DFMS97, Hen99]), and we generally make no attempt to\nsurvey the physics literature here. Although this work is primarily a survey,\nwe will also present without references several simple results (including the\n3\n\n\fnatural coupling of harmonic crystals with the GFF via finite elements and\nthe coupling of the GFF and Brownian motion via \"field exploration\") that\nwe have not found articulated in the literature.\nRemark 1.1. In the physics literature, what we call the GFF is often called the\nmassless free field or the Euclidean bosonic massless free field - or else introduced without a title as something like \"the field whose action is the Dirichlet\nenergy\" or \"the Gaussian field with point covariances given by Green's function.\"\n\n2\n2.1\n\nGaussian free fields\nStandard Gaussians\n\nConsider the space Hs (D) of smooth, real-valued functions on Rd that are\nsupported on a compact subset of a domain D \u2282 Rd (so that, in particular,\n2\ntheir first derivatives are\nR in L (D)). This space has a Dirichlet inner product\ndefined by (f1 , f2 )\u2207 = D (\u2207f1 * \u2207f2 ) dx. Denote by H(D) the Hilbert space\ncompletion of Hs (D). (The space H(D) is in fact a Sobolev space, sometimes written H10 (D) or W01,2 (D) [Ada75].) The quantity (f, f )\u2207 is called the\nDirichlet energy of f .\nLet g be a bijective map from D to another domain D \u2032 . If g is a translation\nor an orthogonal rotation, then it is not hard to see that\nZ\nZ\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u2207(f1 \u25e6 g ) * \u2207(f2 \u25e6 g ) dx = (\u2207f1 * \u2207f2 ) dx.\nD\u2032\n\nD\n\nIf g(x) = cx for a constant c, then\nZ\nZ\n\u22121\n\u22121\nd\u22122\n(\u2207f1 * \u2207f2 ) dx.\n\u2207(f1 \u25e6 g ) * \u2207(f2 \u25e6 g ) dx = c\nD\u2032\n\nD\n\nIn the special case d = 2, the equality holds without the cd\u22122 term. In\nfact, an elementary change of variables calculation implies that this equality\nholds for any conformal map g and any f1 , f2 \u2208 H(D). (It is enough to\nverify this for f1 , f2 \u2208 Hs (D).) In other words, the Dirichlet inner product is\ninvariant under conformal transformations when d = 2. (This is one reason\nthat the GFF is a useful tool in the study of conformally invariant random\ntwo dimensional fractals like SLE [SS].)\n4\n\n\fWhen D is a geometric manifold without boundary (e.g., the unit torus\nR /Zd ), we define Hs (D) to be the set of all zero mean smooth functions on\nD, and again we take H(D) to be its completion to a Hilbert space with the\nDirichlet inner product.\nNote that by integration by parts, (f1 , f2 )\u2207 = (f1 , \u2212\u2206f2 ), where \u2206 is\nthe Dirichlet Laplacian operator and (*, *) is the standard inner product for\nRfunctions on D. Throughout this\nR paper, we use the notation (f1 , f2 )\u2207 :=\n(\u2207f\n*\n\u2207f\n)\ndx\nand\n(f\n,\nf\n)\n:=\n(f f ) dx when the integrals clearly make\n1\n2\n1 2\nD\nD 1 2\nsense (even if f1 and f2 do not necessarily belong to H(D) and L2 (D), re1/2\nspectively). We also write kf k = (f, f )1/2 and kf k\u2207 = (f, f )\u2207 .\nGiven any finite-dimensional real vector space V with (positive definite)\ninner product (*, *), denote by \u03bcV the probability measure e\u2212(v,v)/2 Z \u22121 dv,\nwhere dv is Lebesgue measure on V and Z is a normalizing constant. The\nfollowing is well known (and easy to prove) [Jan97]:\nd\n\nProposition 2.1. Let v be a Lebesgue measurable random variable on V =\nRd with inner product (*, *) as above. Then the following are equivalent:\n1. v has law \u03bcV .\nP\n2. v has the same law as dj=1 \u03b1j vj where v1 , . . . , vd are a deterministic\northonormal basis for V and the \u03b1j are i.i.d. Gaussian random variables\nwith mean zero and variance one.\n3. The characteristic function of v is given by\n1\nE exp (i(v, t)) = exp(\u2212 ktk2 )\n2\nfor all t \u2208 Rd .\n4. For each fixed w \u2208 V , the inner product (v, w) is a zero mean Gaussian\nrandom variable with variance (w, w).\nA random variable satisfying one of the equivalent items in Proposition 2.1\nis called a standard Gaussian random variable on V . Roughly speaking,\nthe GFF is a standard Gaussian random variable h on H(D). Because H(D)\nis infinite dimensional, some care is required to make this precise. One might\nnaively try to define h as a random element of H(D) whose projections\nonto finite dimensional subspaces of H(D) are standard Gaussian random\nvariables on those subspaces. However, it is easy see that this is impossible.\n5\n\n\f(Expanded in terms of an orthonormal basis, the individual components of h\nwould have to be i.i.d. Gaussians - and hence a.s. the sum of their squares\nwould be infinite, implying h 6\u2208 H(D).)\nWe will now review two commonly used (and closely related) ways to\ndefine standard Gaussian random variables on infinite dimensional Hilbert\nspaces: the abstract Wiener space approach and the Gaussian Hilbert space\napproach.\n\n2.2\n\nAbstract Wiener spaces\n\nOne way to construct a standard Gaussian random variable h on an infinite\ndimensional Hilbert space H, proposed by Gross in 1967, is to define h as\na random element not of H but of a larger Banach space B containing H\nas a subspace [Gro67]. To this end, [Gro67] defines a norm | * | on H to be\nmeasurable if for each \u01eb > 0, there is a finite-dimensional subspace E\u01eb of H\nfor which\nE \u22a5 E\u01eb =\u21d2 \u03bcE ({x \u2208 E : |x| > \u01eb}) < \u01eb,\nwhere \u03bcE is the standard Gaussian measure on E. In particular, we may cite\nthe following proposition [Gro67]. (Throughout this subsection, (*, *) and k*k\ndenote the inner product and norm of H.)\nProposition 2.2. If T is a Hilbert Schmidt operator on H (i.e.,\nX\nkT fj k2 < \u221e\nfor some orthonormal basis {fj } of H), then the norm kT * k is measurable.\nWrite B for the Banach space completion of H under the norm | * |, B \u2032\nfor the space of continuous linear functionals on B, and B for the smallest\n\u03c3-algebra in which the functionals in B \u2032 are measurable. Since each element\nof B \u2032 is a continuous linear functional on H, we may view B \u2032 as a subset\nof H. Thus B \u2032 \u2282 H \u2282 B. When b \u2208 B and f \u2208 B \u2032 , we use the inner\nproduct notation (f, b) to denote the value of the functional f at b. (When\nf \u2208 H, this is equal to the inner product of f and b in H.) Given any\nfinite dimensional subspace E of B \u2032 with\nP H-orthonormal basis v1 , . . . , vk , the\nmap \u03c6E : B \u2192 E given by \u03c6E (b) = (vj , b)vj is an extension to B of the\northogonal projection map from H to E. Let \u03bcE be the standard Gaussian\nmeasure on E. Gross proved the following:\n6\n\n\fTheorem 2.3. If |*| is measurable, then there is a unique probability measure\nP on (B, B) for which P (\u03c6\u22121\nE S) = \u03bcE (S) for each finite dimensional subspace\nE of B \u2032 and each Lebesgue measurable S \u2282 E.\nBy Proposition 2.1, we can restate this as follows:\nTheorem 2.4. If |*| is measurable, then there is a unique probability measure\nP such that if h is a random variable with probability measure P then for\nany f \u2208 B \u2032 , the random variable (h, f ) is a one-dimensional Gaussian of\nzero mean and variance (f, f )2 .\nThe triple (H, B, P ) is called an abstract Wiener space. The example\nthat motivated Gross's construction is the standard Wiener space, in which\nH = H ((0, 1)), endowed with the Dirichlet inner product, |*| is the supremum\nnorm, and B is the set of continuous functions on [0, 1] that vanish on {0, 1}.\nUsing the Hilbert space H(D) (with Dirichlet inner product) we can now\ngive a definition:\nDefinition 2.5. Given a measurable norm | * | on H(D) and B \u2032 , B, B as\nabove, the Gaussian free field determined by norm | * | is the unique\nB-valued, B-measurable random variable h with the property that for every\nfixed f \u2208 B \u2032 , the P\nrandom variable (h, f )\u2207 is a Gaussian of variance kf k\u2207 .\nEquivalently, h = \u03b1j fj , where \u03b1j are i.i.d. Gaussians of unit variance and\nzero mean and the fj are elements of B which form an orthonormal basis for\nH(D) - and the sumP\nis defined within the space B. (It is not hard to see\nthat the partial sums m\nj=1 \u03b1j fj converge almost surely in B [Gro67].)\n\nRemark 2.6. We can analogously define the complex Gaussian free field determined by norm | * | by replacing H, B \u2032 , and B with their complex analogs\nand writing h = h1 + ih2 , where the h1 and h2 are independent real Gaussian\nfree fields.\n\n2.3\n\nChoosing a measurable norm\n\nWe now construct one natural family of measurable norms on H(D) using\nthe eigenvalues of the Laplacian. Suppose that {ej } are eigenvectors of the\nDirichlet Laplacian on D which form an orthonormal basis of L2 (D) endowed\nwith the usual inner product and have negative eigenvalues {\u03bbj } (ordered to\nbe non-increasing in j). Then an orthonormal basis for H(D) is given by\nfj = (\u2212\u03bbj )\u22121/2 ej , since integration by parts implies (ej , ek )\u2207 = (ej , \u2212\u2206ek ) =\n7\n\n\f0 whenever j 6= k and (fj , fj )\u2207 = ((\u2212\u03bbj )\u22121/2 ej , (\u2212\u03bbj )1/2 ej )\u2207 = 1. (This\nchoice of the fj is not invariant under conformal transformations of D when\nd = 2.)\nThe reader may recall that by Weyl's formula, if D \u2282 Rd is bounded,\nthen j 2/d /(\u2212\u03bbj ) tends to a constant as j \u2192 \u221e. (References and much more\nprecise estimates on the growth of \u03bbj are given in [NS05].) We define powers\nof the negative Dirichlet Laplacian by writing, for each a \u2208 R,\nX\nX\n(\u2212\u2206)a\n\u03b2j ej :=\n(\u2212\u03bbj )a \u03b2j ej ,\na definition which makes sense even when a is not an integer. We then\nformally\ndefine LaP\n(D) := (\u2212\u2206)a L2 (D) to be the set of sums of the\nP\nPform\n\u2212a\n2\n\u03b2j ej for which\n\u03b2j (\u2212\u03bbj ) ej \u2208 L (D). (When a < 0, this sum\n\u03b2j ej\nmay not converge in L2 (D), but since (\u2212\u03bbj )\u2212a is polynomial in j, it always\nconverges in the space of distributions on D; see Remark 2.8 below.)\nSince integration by parts gives\n\u0001\n(f, g)\u2207 = (f, (\u2212\u2206)g) = (\u2212\u2206)1/2 f, (\u2212\u2206)1/2 g ,\nthe map (\u2212\u2206)\u22121/2 gives a Hilbert space isomorphism from L2 (D) (with the\nL2 inner product) to H(D) (with the Dirichlet inner product). Thus we may\nwrite H(D) = L\u22121/2 (D).\nSimilarly, for any a \u2208 R, we may view La (D) as a Hilbert space whose\ninner product (*, *)a is the pullback of the L2 inner product, i.e., (f, g)a =\n((\u2212\u2206)\u2212a f, (\u2212\u2206)\u2212a g). We abbreviate kf ka := ((\u2212\u2206)\u2212a f, (\u2212\u2206)\u2212a f )1/2 for the\ncorresponding norm. An equivalent way to define La (D) is as the Hilbert\nspace closure of Hs (D) under this norm.\nProposition 2.7. Suppose D is a bounded domain in Rd . Then we have the\nfollowing:\nP\n1. In the space of formal sums\n\u03b2j ej (or the space of distributions) we\nhave La (D) \u2282 Lb (D) whenever a < b.\n2. k*kb is a measurable norm on La (D) (where the latter has inner product\n(*, *)a) whenever a < b \u2212 d/4.\n3. When f \u2208 L\u2212a (D), the functional g \u2192 (f, g) is continuous on La (D).\n\n8\n\n\fP\nProof.\nThe first item is immediate since\n(\u2212\u03bbj )\u22122a |\u03b2j |2 < \u221e implies\nP\n\u22122b\n2\n(\u2212\u03bbj ) |\u03b2j | < \u221e. To prove the second, we first write kf kb = kTb\u2212a f ka\nwhere Tc := (\u2212\u2206)\u2212c . Let {gj } be an orthonormal basis for Lb under the\ninner product (*, *)b . Then kf kb is a Hilbert Schmidt\noperator\nP\nP (and hence\nmeasurable by Proposition 2.2) provided that\nkTa gj k2b P\n= (\u2212\u03bbj )2a\u22122b <\n\u221e. Weyl's formula implies that this holds provided that\nj 2(2a\u22122b)/d < \u221e,\nwhich in turn holds whenever 2(2a \u2212 2b)/d < \u22121, i.e., a < b \u2212 d/4. The final\nstatement in the proposition is trivial since\n(f, g) = ((\u2212\u2206)a f, (\u2212\u2206)a g)a = (f, (\u2212\u2206)2a g)a ,\nand (\u2212\u2206)2a g \u2208 La .\nProposition 2.7 implies that, although we cannot construct the GFF h\nas a random element of H(D), we can construct h as a random element of\nB = Lb (D), provided b > d\u22122\n, using the abstract Wiener space definition\n4\ngiven in Section 2.2.\nIn particular, when d = 1, we may take b = 0 and define h as a random\nelement of L2 (D). When d = 2, we cannot define h as a random element\nof L2 (D) (indeed, from the power series expansion, we expect the L2 norm\nof h to be almost surely infinite), but we can define h as a random element\nof B = Lb (D) for any b > 0. In this case, we may view (h, *) as a random\ncontinuous linear functional on L\u2212b (D) \u2282 L2 (D) for any b > 0. In general,\n\u03c1 \u2192 (h, \u03c1) is a random continuous linear functional on L\u2212b (D) whenever\n.\nb > d\u22122\n4\nRemark 2.8. Sometimes it is convenient to restrict attention to smooth, compactly supported test functions \u03c1. Following the usual definition, we say that\nh is a distribution if (h, *) is well defined as a functional on the space Hs (D)\nof smooth compactly supported functions and this functional is continuous\nwith respect to the topology of uniform convergence of all derivatives. If\n\u03c1 \u2208 Hs (D), then (\u2212\u2206)a \u03c1 \u2208 Hs (D) \u2282 L2 (D) for each positive integer a, and\nit follows that \u03c1 \u2208 La (D) for all a. If h \u2208 Lb (D) for some b, then (h, *)\nis a continuous functional on Lc (D) for any negative integer c < \u2212b. This\nimplies that the restriction of (h, *) to Hs (D) is continuous in the topology\nof uniform convergence of all derivatives (since uniform convergence of all\nderivatives in particular implies convergence in Lc (D)), so h is also a distribution. Many texts (e.g., [GJ87]) simply define the GFF to be the random\ndistribution determined in this way. Since Hs (D) is dense in each of the\nlarger spaces Lb (D), we don't lose any information by restricting (h, *) to\n9\n\n\fsmooth functions, since there is a unique way to extend (h, *) to a continuous\nfunction on the larger space.\nRemark 2.9. Let \u03c6 be rotationally symmetric smooth positive bump function\non Rd whose integral is 1 and which vanishes outside of the unit ball in Rd .\nLet fr,z (x) = r \u2212d \u03c6((x \u2212 z)/r). This function is the density of a probability\nmeasure on the ball Br (z) of radius r > 0 centered at z \u2208 Rd . Let Dr be the\nset of pairs (r, z) for which r > 0 and Br (z) \u2282 D. Then the map (r, z) \u2192 fr,z\nis continuous from Dr to Lb (D) for any b \u2208 R. Hence if h is an instance of the\nGFF defined by one of the norms discussed above, then \u03c8((r, z)) = (h, fr,z )\nis a random continuous function from Dr to R. Similar arguments show that\nall the derivatives of \u03c8 are continuous almost surely. Since the span of the\nfr,z is dense, h is almost surely determined by the random smooth function\n\u03c8.\n\n2.4\n\nGaussian Hilbert spaces\n\nThe definition of the GFF in terms of abstract Wiener spaces has an aesthetic\nand practical drawback in that the choice of measurable norm is somewhat\narbitrary, and it does not yield a description of the random variable (h, f )\u2207\nfor general f \u2208 H(D). In this section we give a way to make (h, *)\u2207 well\ndefined as a random variable for each f \u2208 H(D)-accepting, of course, the\nfact that f \u2192 (h, f )\u2207 cannot be defined as a continuous functional.\nConsider the probability space (\u03a9, F , \u03bc) where \u03a9 is the set of real sequences \u03b1 = {\u03b1j }, j \u2265 1, F is the smallest \u03c3-algebra in which the coordinate\nprojections \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b1j are measurable, and \u03bc is the probability measure in\nwhich the \u03b1j are i.i.d. Gaussian variables of unit variance and zero mean.\nIn the previous section,\nwe defined the Gaussian free field (GFF) to be\nP\nthe formal sum h = \u221e\n\u03b1\nj=1 j fj (which converges in a larger space B), where\nthe fj are an ordered orthonormal basis P\nfor H(D) and the \u03b1j are i.i.d. Gaussians. Now, for any fixed f \u2208 H(D) =\n\u03b2j fj , the inner product (h, f )\u2207 is\na random variable\nthat\ncan\nbe\nalmost\nsurely\nwell defined as the limit of the\nPk\npartial sums j=1 \u03b2j \u03b1j . (It is important here that we fix the order of summation in advance, since the sequence \u03b2j \u03b1j is not necessarily a.s. absolutely\nsummable.)\nNow we have a formal definition:\nDefinition 2.10. The Gaussian free field derived from the ordered\northonormal basis {fj } is the indexed collection G(D) of random variables\n10\n\n\f(h, f )\u2207 described above.\nA more abstract definition, which does not specifically reference a basis\nor an ordering, is as follows. First, we take the following definition from\n[Jan97]:\nDefinition 2.11. A Gaussian linear space is a real linear space of random\nvariables, defined on an arbitrary probability space (\u03a9, F , \u03bc), such that each\nvariable in the space is a centered (i.e., mean zero) Gaussian. A Gaussian\nHilbert space is a Gaussian linear space which is complete, i.e., a closed\nsubspace of L2R (\u03a9, F , \u03bc), consisting of centered GaussianR variables, which\ninherits the standard L2R (\u03a9, F , \u03bc) inner product: (X, Y ) = XY d\u03bc. We also\nassume that F is the smallest \u03c3-algebra in which these random variables are\nmeasurable.\nNote that if X1 , . . . , Xn are any real random variables with the property\nthat all linear combinations of the Xj are centered Gaussians, then the joint\nlaw of the Xj is completely determined by the covariances Cov[Xj , Xk ] =\nE(Xj Xk ), and it is a linear transformation of the standard normal distribution. A similar statement holds for infinite collections of random variables\n[Jan97]. Then we have:\nDefinition 2.12. A Gaussian free field is any Gaussian Hilbert space G(D)\nof random variables denoted by \"(h, f )\u2207 \"-one variable for each f \u2208 H(D)-\nthat inherits the Dirichlet inner product structure of H(D), i.e.,\nE[(h, a)\u2207 (h, b)\u2207 ] = (a, b)\u2207 .\nIn other words, the map from f to the random variable (h, f )\u2207 is an inner\nproduct preserving map from H(D) to G(D).\n\nBy the identity (a, b) = 21 [(a + b, a + b) \u2212 (a, a) \u2212 (b, b)], this map is inner\nproduct preserving if and only if it is norm-preserving - i.e., the variance\nof (h, f )\u2207 is (f, f )\u2207 for each f \u2208 H(D) - and linear. Thus we have the\nfollowing:\n\nProposition 2.13. An H(D)-indexed linear space of random variables denoted (h, f )\u2207 is a Gaussian free field if and only if the map from f \u2208 H(D) to\nthe random variable (h, f )\u2207 is linear and each (h, f )\u2207 is a centered Gaussian\nwith variance (f, f )\u2207 .\nThroughout the remainder of this text, we will adopt the Gaussian Hilbert\nspace approach and view the variables (h, f )\u2207 as being well defined for all\n11\n\n\ff \u2208 H(D). Equivalently, we view (h, \u03c1) as being well defined for all \u03c1 \u2208\n(\u2212\u2206)H(D) = L1/2 .\nRemark 2.14. When \u03c11 and \u03c12 are in Hs (D), the covariance of (h, \u03c11 ) and\n(h, \u03c12 ) can be written as (\u2212\u2206\u22121 \u03c11 , \u2212\u2206\u22121 \u03c12 )\u2207 = (\u2212\u2206\u22121 \u03c11 , \u03c12 ). Since \u2212\u2206\u22121 \u03c1\ncan be written using the Green's function kernel as\nZ\n\u22121\n[\u2212\u2206 \u03c1](x) =\nG(x, y)\u03c1(y)dy,\nD\n\nwe may also write:\nCov[(h, \u03c11 ), (h, \u03c12 )] =\n\nZ\n\n\u03c11 (x)\u03c12 (y)G(x, y)dxdy\n\nD\u00d7D\n\nWhen \u03c11 = \u03c12 = \u03c1, the above expression has an interpretation in electrostatics as the energy of assembly of an electric charge density \u03c1 (grounded\nat \u2202D), and \u2206\u22121 \u03c1 is the electrostatic potential of that density. The energy\nof assembly of a density of charge is the amount of energy required to move\ncharge into that configuration starting from a zero-energy configuration (in\nwhich the potential is everywhere zero). Thus the Laplacian p = (\u2212\u2206)h is,\nat least intuitively, a random electrostatic charge distribution in which the\nprobability of p is proportional to\nexp(\u2212energy of assembly of p).\n(See [SS] for more references relevant to this interpretation.)\n\n2.5\n\nSimple examples\n\nLet D be the unit torus Rd /Zd . As before Hs (D) is the set of smooth functions on D with zero mean and H(D) is the Hilbert space closure of Hs (D)\nusing the Dirichlet inner product. An orthonormal basis for the complex\nversion of H(D) is given by eigenvectors of the Laplacian, which have the\n1\nform fk (x) = 2\u03c0|k|\ne2\u03c0ix*k , for k \u2208 Zd \\{0}. Thus, the complex GFF on D\nis a random distribution whose Fourier transform consists of i.i.d. complex\nGaussians times (2\u03c0|k|)\u22121.\nIf d \u2265 2, then\nany fixed x \u2208 D and any fixed ordering of the k's, the\nPfor\nk\npartial sums of j=1 \u03b1j fj (x) diverge almost surely, since the variance of the\nP\npartial sums are given by (2\u03c0)\u22122 |k|\u22122 , and this sum diverges when d \u2265 2.\n12\n\n\fWhen d = 1, the limit h can be defined a.s. at any given x and is a\ncomplex Gaussian. Since the above sum converges to (2\u03c0)\u22122 2\u03b6(2) = 1/12,\nthe real and imaginary components of h(x) each have variance 1/12. In\nfact, it is not hard to see that the difference h(x) \u2212 h(0) can be written as\n(h, f x )\u2207 = (h, \u03b4x \u2212 \u03b40 ) where f x = \u2212\u2206\u22121 (\u03b4x \u2212 \u03b40 ) is continuous and linear on\n(0, x) and (x, 1). By computing dot products of (f x , f y )\u2207 , the reader may\nverify that h has the same law as a multiple of the Brownian bridge on the\ncircle, normalized by adding a constant so that it has zero mean. A similar\nargument shows that the one-dimensional GFF on an interval is a multiple of\nthe Brownian bridge on that interval, and an even simpler argument shows\nthat the one-dimensional GFF on (0, \u221e) is a Brownian motion. In the latter\ncase, we may take [\u2212\u2206\u22121 \u03b4x ](y) = min{x, y} and G(x, y) = min{x, y}. The\nvariance of h(x) = (h, \u03b4x ) is G(x, x) = x.\nRemark 2.15. The definition of the Dirichlet inner product, and hence the\nGaussian free field, has an obvious analog any manifold on which the Dirichlet energy can be defined. In particular, since the Dirichlet inner product\nis conformally invariant when d = 2, the Dirichlet energy has a canonical\ndefinition for Riemann surfaces. There is also a \"free boundary\" version in\nwhich we replace Hs (D) by the set of all smooth, mean zero functions on D\nwith first derivatives in L2 (D).\nRemark 2.16. The GFF has a natural dynamic analog in which each (ht , f )\u2207\nis the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with zero mean whose stationary distribution has variance kf k2\u2207 . Thus, instead of taking (h, fj )\u2207 to be an i.i.d.\nsequence of random variables, we take (ht , fj )\u2207 to be an i.i.d. sequence of\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck processes parameterized by t.\n\n2.6\n\nField averages and the Markov property\n\nIf \u2212\u2206a = \u03c1 is constant on an open subset D \u2032 \u2282 D and equal to zero outside\nof D \u2032 (i.e., a is harmonic outside of D \u2032 ), then we can think of (h, a)\u2207 = (h, \u03c1)\nas describing (up to a constant multiple) the mean value of h on D \u2032 . We will\nretain that interpretation when h is chosen from the Gaussian free field-\ni.e., we think of h as fluctuating so rapidly that it is not necessarily even\nwell-defined as a function, but the \"average value of h on D \u2032 \" is well-defined.\nSince Hilbert spaces\nare self dual, if \u03c1 is any probability measure on D for\nR\nwhich f \u2192 \u03c1f := f P\nd\u03c1 is a continuous linear functional on H(D) (which is\nthe case if and only if [\u03c1fj ]2 < \u221e), then there is an f for which \u03c1g = (f, g)\u2207\n13\n\n\ffor all g \u2208 H(D), and we have \u03c1 = \u2212\u2206f \u2208 \u2206H(D).\nFor example, if d = 2 and \u03c1 is the uniform measure on a line segment\nL in the interior of D, then \u03c1h is well-defined. In this case,\nmay\nP the reader\n2\ncheck that f \u2192 \u03c1f is continuous on Hs (D). (The sums [\u03c1fj ] < \u221e can\nbe computed explicitly when D is a rectangle; continuity then follows for\ndomains that are subsets of that rectangle.)\nAnother important observation is that if H1 and H2 are any closed orthogonal subspaces of H(D), then (h, *)\u2207 restricted to these two subspaces is\nindependent. To be precise, denote by FHj the smallest \u03c3-algebra in which\nh \u2192 (h, f )\u2207 is a measurable function for each f \u2208 Hj . Then it is clear that\nFH1 and FH2 together generate F , and moreover, \u03bc is independent on these\ntwo subalgebras.\nFor example, given an open subset U of D, we can write HU (D) for the\nclosure of the set of smooth functions that are supported in a compact subset\nof U. If a \u2208 HU (D) and b is harmonic in U, then integration by parts implies\n(a, b)\u2207 = (a, \u2212\u2206b) = 0. Thus HU (D) is orthogonal to the closed subspace\nHU\u22a5 (D) of functions that are harmonic on U.\nTheorem 2.17. The spaces HU (D) and HU\u22a5 (D) span H(D).\nProof. To see this it is enough to show that if f \u2208 Hs (D), then f can\nbe written as a + b, with a \u2208 HU (D), b \u2208 HU\u22a5 (D). Roughly speaking, we\nwould like to set b to be the unique continuous function which is equal to f\noutside of U and harmonic inside of U, and then write a = f \u2212 b. But in\nsome cases-e.g., if U is the complement of a discrete set of points-there is\nno b with this property. We will give a slightly modified definition of b and\nshow b \u2208 HU (D) and f \u2212 b \u2208 HU\u22a5 (D).\nLet b\u03b4 (x) be the expected value of f at the point at which a Brownian\nmotion started at x first exits the set U\u03b4 of points of distance more than\n\u03b4 from the complement of U. Then a\u03b4 (x) = f \u2212 b\u03b4 (x) is supported on a\ncompact subset of U and is clearly in HU (D). Since HU (D) is the closure of\nthe union of the HU\u03b4 , the a\u03b4 's-which are projections onto the increasing (as\n\u03b4 \u2192 0) subspaces HU\u03b4 -converge to some function a \u2208 HU (D). The b\u03b4 thus\nmust converge to some b, and b \u2208 HU\u22a5 (since the limit of harmonic functions\nis harmonic), and f = a + b.\nFor short, we will write FU = FHU and FU\u22a5 = FHU\u22a5 . The \u03c3-algebra FU\u22a5 is\none in which random variables of the form (h, f )\u2207 = (h, \u2212\u2206f ) are measurable\nwhenever \u2206f vanishes on U. Intuitively, it allows us to measure the \"values\"\n14\n\n\fof h outside of U. On the other hand, FU allows us to measure the \"values\"\nof h inside of U modulo the harmonic functions on U. The independence of\nthe GFF on FU and FU\u22a5 can be interpreted as saying that given the values\nof h outside of U, the distribution of the values of h in U is a harmonic\nextension of the values of h on the boundary of U plus an independent GFF\non U. This property of the GFF is called a Markov property. It holds, in\nparticular, if d = 2 and the complement of U is a simple path in D; in this\ncase, the FU\u22a5 -measurable functions measure the values of h along that path\n(or at least the average values of h along subintervals of that path).\nIf U is closed and x \u2208 D\\U, then it is not hard to see that the projection fx,U of \u2212\u2206\u22121 \u03b4x onto HU has finite Dirichlet energy and that its Laplacian is supported on the boundary of D\\U. Although h(x) = (h, \u03b4x ) =\n(h, \u2212\u2206\u22121 \u03b4x )\u2207 is not a well-defined random variable, we may still intuitively\ninterpret (h, fx,U )\u2207 as the \"expected\" value of h(x) given the values of h\nin U. The reader may check that the function (h, fx,U )\u2207 is almost surely\nharmonic in D\\U. (More precisely, since the event \"(h, fx,U )\u2207 is harmonic\"\nis not in our \u03c3-algebra, one shows that the function (h, fx,U )\u2207 defined on\ndyadic rational points of D\\U almost surely extends continuously to a harmonic function in all of D\\U; this is the same way one proves continuity of\nBrownian motion in, e.g., Chapter 7 of [Dur96].) We interpret this function\nas the harmonic extension to D\\U of the \"values\" of h on the boundary of\nU.\n\n2.7\n\nField exploration: Brownian motion and the GFF\n\nIn this subsection, we describe a simple way of using a space-filling curve\nto give a linear correspondence between the GFF and Brownian motion.\nRoughly speaking, we \"explore\" the field h along a space-filling curve, and\nthe Brownian motion goes up or down depending on whether the values we\nencounter are greater than or less than what we expect. Then each of the\nrandom variables (h, f )\u2207 can be viewed as an appropriate stochastic integral\nof this Brownian motion. Although analogous constructions hold in higher\ndimensions, we will assume for simplicity that d = 2 and D is a simply\nconnected bounded domain.\nFirst, choose f0 so that \u2206f0 is a negative constant on D. Then let \u03b3 :\n[0, 1] \u2192 D be a continuous space-filling curve. For each t, denote by \u03b3t the\n\u22a5\ncompact set \u03b3([0, t]), and let Pt be the projection onto the subspace HD\\\u03b3\nof\nt\nfunctions harmonic in D\\\u03b3t. We also require that \u03b3 remains continuous when\n15\n\n\fit is parameterized in such a way that kPt (f0 )k2\u2207 = t for all t \u2208 [0, kf0 k2\u2207 ].\n(This will be the case provided that \u03b3s is a proper subset of \u03b3t whenever\ns < t. In other words, although \u03b3 may intersect itself, it cannot spend an\nentire positive-length interval of time retracing points that have already been\nseen.)\nBy decomposing f0 into its projection onto the complementary subspaces\n\u22a5\nFD\\\u03b3t and FD\\\u03b3t , we easily observe the following:\n\u22a5\n) = (h, Pt (f0 ))\u2207 .\nW (t) := E((h, f0 )\u2207 |FD\\\u03b3\nt\n\nClearly, W is a martingale, and each W (t) \u2212 W (s) is Gaussian with variance\n|s \u2212 t|. Hence, W has the same law as a Brownian motion (in the smallest\n\u03c3-algebra where each W (t) is measurable).\nNow, the reader may easily verify that the linear span of the functions\nPt (f0 ), with t \u2208 [0, 1], is dense in H(D). Thus, given the Brownian motion\nW (t), it should be possible, almost surely, to determine (h, fj )\u2207 for each j.\nTo this end, observe that for any other f , the value\n\u22a5\n) = (h, Pt (f ))\u2207\nWf (t) := E((h, f )\u2207 |FD\\\u03b3\nt\n\nis also a martingale, and is Brownian motion when time is parameterized by\n2\nkPt (f )||y\u2207\n. The question is, how are Wf and W related?\nThe answer would be obvious if we had f = aPs (f0 ) for some fixed constants a and 0 < s < 1. In this case, Wf (t) = aW (min{s, t}). A similar\nresult holds if f is any finite sum of such functions. We have now defined\nWf (t) for a dense linear space of functions f \u2208 H(D), and we may choose an\northonormal\nbasis {fj } for H(D) from among that space. Given an arbitrary\nP\nf = \u03b1P\nj fj and any fixed t, we can take Wf (t) to be the limit of the partial\nsums of\n\u03b1j Wfj (t).\nThe above discussion gives a linear correspondence between the GFF and\na Brownian motion. That correspondences of this sort should exist is not\nsurprising, given that a Brownian motion can be interpreted as a Gaussian\nfree field on the interval I = (0, kf0 k2\u2207 ) that is only required to vanish at\nthe left endpoint (i.e., H(I) is the Dirichlet inner product Hilbert space\ncompletion of the set of smooth functions on I that vanish at zero). The\nmap that sends the function g s (t) = min{s, t} in H(I) to Ps (f0 ) \u2208 H(D)\nextends to a Hilbert space isomorphism between H(D) and H(I) and the\ncorrespondence between the GFF and Brownian motion is induced by this\nisomorphism.\n16\n\n\f2.8\n\nCircle averages and thick points\n\nFix a domain D \u2282 R2 on which the GFF is defined. For x \u2208 D and t \u2208 R,\nwrite Bx (t) for the mean value of the GFF on the circle of radius e\u2212t centered\nat x (provided t is large enough that the disc enclosed by this circle lies in\nD). The reader may verify that for each x \u2208 D, the law of Bx (t) is that of\na multiple of a Brownian motion. If x 6= y, then the GFF Markov property\nimplies that the Brownian motions Bx (t) and By (t) grow independently of\none another once t is large enough so that 2e\u2212t < |x \u2212 y|. Let\nR\u221e\nZ \u221e\nBx (s)e\u2212s ds\ns=t\nR\u221e\nAx (t) =\n=\nBx (s)et\u2212s ds\n\u2212s ds\ne\ns=t\ns=t\n\nbe the mean value of the GFF on the disc of radius e\u2212t .\nOne can generate various fractal subsets of D by considering the set of\npoints x for which Bx (t) or Ax (t) are in some sense highly atypical. For\nexample, one might consider the set of x for which lim sup |Bx (t)| \u2264 C for a\nconstant C, or more generally the set of x for which lim sup |Bx (t)\u2212f (t)| \u2264 C\nfor a some function f .\nIn [HP] the authors fix a constant 0 \u2264\n\u221a a \u2264 2 and define a thick point as\na point x \u2208 D for which lim Ax (t)/t = a. They prove that the Hausdorff\ndimension of the set of thick points of a GFF is almost surely equal to 2 \u2212 a.\n\n3\n\nGeneral results for Gaussian Hilbert spaces\n\nBy replacing the Dirichlet inner product with a different bilinear form, it\nis possible to construct different types of Gaussian Hilbert spaces, some of\nwhich play important roles in constructive quantum field theory [GJ87]. Most\nof the results in the previous section depended heavily on the choice of inner\nproduct. In this section, we will back up and make some statements about\nthe Gaussian free field that are largely independent of this choice.\n\n3.1\n\nMoments and Schwinger functions\n\nThe moments of the variables (h, \u03c1) may be computed explicitly. Suppose\nthat \u03c1j = \u2212\u2206fj for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k. First, we know that E [(h, \u03c1)\u2207 ] = 0 and\nE [(h, \u03c11 )(h, \u03c12 )] = (f1 , f2 )\u2207 . We can now cite the following from the first\nchapter of [Jan97]:\n17\n\n\fTheorem 3.1. We have\nk/2\nXY\n(fMj,1 , fMj,2 )\u2207\nE[(h, \u03c11 ) * * * (h, \u03c1k )] =\nM j=1\n\nwhere M ranges over the set of all partitions M = {(Mj,1 , Mj,2 )} of {1, . . . , k}\ninto k/2 disjoint pairs. In particular, this value is zero whenever k is odd.\nIf each (fj , fk )\u2207 is positive (which will be the case, e.g., if each \u03c1j is a\npositive probability density function), we can interpret the above value as\nthe partition function for a process that chooses a random perfect matching\nM of the complete graph on 1, . . . , k with probability proportional to\nk/2\nY\n(\u2212\u2206\u22121 \u03c1Mj,1 , \u03c1Mj,2 )\nj=1\n\ni.e., each edge (i, j) is weighted by (fi , fj )\u2207 . (This is a useful mnemonic, if\nnothing else.) These perfect matchings are simple examples of Feynman\ndiagrams (see [Jan97] or [GJ87]). The moment computations above apply\nto general Gaussian Hilbert spaces when (*, *)\u2207 is replaced by the appropriate\ncovariance inner product.\nNow, for any x1 , . . . , xk \u2208QD, one would also like to define the point\nmoments Sk (x1 , . . . , xk ) := E kj=1 h(xj ). In the case of the GFF when d \u2265\n2, these h(xj ) are not defined as random variables. If they were defined\nas randomR variables, then, writing \u03c1 = \u2212\u2206f , we would also expect that\nE(h, \u03c1) = D S1 (x)\u03c1(x)dx and more generally\nE\n\nk\nY\nj=1\n\n(h, \u03c1j ) =\n\nZ\n\nSk (x1 , . . . , xk )\n\nDk\n\nY\n\n\u03c1j (xj )dx.\n\nIt turns out that for a broad class of Gaussian and non-Gaussian random\nfields that includes the GFF, there do exist functions (or at least distributions) Sk : D k \u2192 R, called Schwinger functions, for which the latter statement holds, at least when the \u03c1j are smooth (Proposition 6.1.4 of [GJ87]).\nIn the case of the GFF, the reader may verify that Sk is identically zero\nwhen k is odd and S2 (x1 , x2 ) = G(x1 , x2 ). For even k > 2, Sk can be\ncomputed from S2 using the expansion given in Theorem 3.1.\n18\n\n\f3.2\n\nWiener decompositions and Wick products\n\nFrom Chapter 2 of [Jan97], we cite the following:\nTheorem 3.2. The set of polynomials in the (h, fj )\u2207 is a dense subspace of\nL2 (\u03a9, F , \u03bc).\nThe space L2 (\u03a9, F , \u03bc), endowed with the inner product (X, Y ) = E(XY ),\ncan be viewed as the closure of the direct sum of Hilbert spaces H :n:, each\nof which is the closure of the set of degree n polynomials in (h, fj )\u2207 that are\northogonal to all degree n \u2212 1 polynomials (in particular, H :1: = H(D)). The\ndecomposition of an element of L2 (\u03a9, F , \u03bc) into these spaces is sometimes\ncalled the Wiener chaos decomposition (Wiener 1938, It\u00f4 1951, Segal\n1956; see Chapter 2 of [Jan97]). See Chapters 2 and 3 of [Jan97] for the\nexplicit form of the projection operators onto each H :n: , as well as a natural\northonormal basis for each H :n:-defined in terms of an orthonormal basis of\nH(D).\nThe above implies in particular that if we use the two-dimensional Gaussian free field to define conformally invariant random sets or random loop ensembles (e.g., via SLE constructions), then any L2 function of these random\nobjects (e.g., the number of loops encircling a given disc) can be expanded\nin terms of this orthonormal basis (although in practice this may be difficult\nto do explicitly).\nNow, given any \u03b71 \u2208 H :m: and \u03b72 \u2208 H :n: , the Wick product of \u03b71 and \u03b72\nis the projection of \u03b71 \u03b72 onto H :m+n: . Explicit formulae for the Wick product\nare given in [Jan97].\n\n3.3\n\nOther fields\n\nThe \"massive\" free fields (see Chapter 6 of [GJ87]) may be defined as a\ncollection of Gaussian random variables (h, \u03c1) with covariances given by\nCov[(h, \u03c11 ), (h, \u03c12 )] = ((\u2212\u2206 + m2 )\u22121 \u03c11 , \u03c12 ),\nwhere m is a real number called the mass. Here, we can either require the\ntest functions \u03c1 to be smooth (the random distribution interpretation) or\nlet them belong to the Hilbert space completion of the smooth functions\nunder the inner product ((\u2212\u2206 + m2 )\u22121 \u03c11 , \u03c12 ) (the Gaussian Hilbert space\ninterpretation).\n19\n\n\fEquivalently, we may consider random variables (h, f )m\n\u2207 := (h, f )\u2207 +\n2 \u22121\nm (h, f ) where f = (\u2212\u2206 + m ) \u03c1. We then have\n2\n\nm\nm\nCov[(h, f1 )m\n\u2207 , (h, f2 )\u2207 ] = (f1 , f2 )\u2207 .\n\nThe GFF is the case m = 0. Most of the results in this paper have straightforward analogs in the case m 6= 0.\nAmong the other fields discussed in quantum field theory (see, e.g., Chapters 8, 10, and 11 of [GJ87]) are probability measures that are absolutely continuous with respect to the massive or massless free fields and have RadonNikodym derivatives given by e\u2212V Z \u22121 , where V is a \"potential\" function on\n\u03a9 and Z is an appropriate normalizing constant.\nIn the more interesting \"interacting particle\" settings, however, this V is\nundefined or infinite for \u03bc-almost\nR all points in \u03a9. This happens, for example,\nif d \u2265 2 and we write V (h) = D P (h) where P is an even polynomial. In\nthis case, we can define approximations Vn to V by writing Vn (h) = V (hn )\nwherePthe hn is a natural approximation to h (e.g., hn could be the partial\nsum nj=1 \u03b1j fj , or it could be one of the discrete lattice approximations in\nthe subsequent section). We then seek to define a field which is the limit, in\nsome sense, of (appropriately normalized versions of) the probability measures e\u2212Vn Zn\u22121 \u03bc. When it exists, the limiting measure is in general not absolutely continuous with respect to \u03bc. See [GJ87] for a mathematically rigorous\napproach to constructing fields, including the so-called P (\u03c6) fields (in particular, the celebrated \u03c64 fields), in a way that uses the Gaussian fields as a\nstarting point.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nHarmonic crystals and discrete approximations of the GFF\nHarmonic crystals and random walks\n\nLet \u039b be a finite graph with a positive weight function w on its edges. If \u03c61\nand \u03c62 are functions on \u039b, we denote their Dirichlet inner product by\nX\n(\u03c61 , \u03c62 )\u2207 =\nw(e)(\u03c61(y) \u2212 \u03c61 (x))(\u03c62 (y) \u2212 \u03c62 (x))\ne=(x,y)\n\nwhere the sum is over all edges e = (x, y) of \u039b. Now, fix a \"boundary\" \u2202\u039b,\nwhich, for now, we can take to be any non-empty subset of the vertices of\n20\n\n\f\u039b. Then the set H(\u039b) of real-valued functions on \u039b whose values are fixed\nto be zero (or some other pre-determined set of boundary values) on \u2202\u039b is a\n|\u039b| \u2212 |\u2202\u039b| dimensional Hilbert space under the Dirichlet inner product. This\nis also a finite dimensional Gaussian Hilbert space, where the probability\n2\ndensity at \u03c6 is proportional to e\u2212k\u03c6k\u2207 /2 .\nWhen \u039b is a large subset of a d-dimensional lattice graph L, and \u2202\u039b\nis the set of vertices that border points of L\\\u039b, the resulting \"discretized\nrandom surface\" model is commonly called the discrete Gaussian free\nfield (DGFF), the discrete massless free field, or the harmonic crystal.\nNext, consider a random walk in which each edge e = (x, y) is activated\nby an independent exponential clock with intensity w(e), at which point if\nthe position is x, it switches to y, and vice versa.\nGiven \u03c6 and x \u2208 \u039b\\\u2202\u039b, write Y for the expected value of \u03c6(x) at the\nfirst neighbor x of y hit by a random walk starting at y, i.e.,\nP\ne=(x,y) w(e)\u03c6(x)\nY = P\n.\ne=(x,y) w(e)\nWhen the weight function w is constant, Y is simply the average value of \u03c6\non the neighbors of x; when w is not constant, Y is an appropriate weighted\naverage of these values.\nThe reader may verify the following one-point discrete Markov property:\nthe random variable \u03c6(y) \u2212 Y is independent of the values\nPof \u03c6(x) for x 6= y\nand this random variable has mean zero and variance 1/ e=(x,y) w(e).\nThis property implies that if we fix the values of \u03c6 on \u2202\u039b (where these\nvalues are not necessarily equal to zero), then the expected value of any \u03c6(x),\nfor x \u2208 \u039b, will be the expected value of \u03c6(xh ), where xh is the first vertex on\n\u2202\u039b that is hit by a random walk beginning at x.\nWe claim that it also implies that Cov[\u03c6(x), \u03c6(y)] is equal to the expected\namount of time that a particle started at x will spend at y before hitting the\nboundary. (This function in x and y is also called the discrete Green's\nfunction on \u039b.) To see this, first observe that when y is fixed, both sides\nare discrete harmonic (with respect to the random walk) in \u039b\\{y}. It is\nthen enough to compute the discrete Laplacian (with\nP respect to the random\nwalk) at y itself and observe that it is equal to 1/ e\u220by w(e) for both sides:\nfor the right hand side (the random walk interpretation), this follows from\nwell-known properties of exponential clocks. For the left hand side, since Y\n\n21\n\n\fand \u03c6(y) \u2212 Y are independent and E(\u03c6(y) \u2212 Y )2 = 1/\n\nP\n\ne=(x,y) w(e),\n\nE\u03c6(y)(\u03c6(y) \u2212 Y ) = E(\u03c6(y) \u2212 Y )2 + EY (\u03c6(y) \u2212 Y ) = 1/\n\nX\n\nwe have\n\nw(e).\n\ne=(x,y)\n\nAs an example, if \u039b is [\u2212n, n]d \u2282 Zd and w = 1, then it is not hard to\nsee (from well-known properties of random walks) that the variance of \u03c6(0)\nis asymptotically proportional to n if d = 1, log(n) if d = 2, and a constant\nif d \u2265 3 (since the random walk is transient in the latter case).\nSee [BDG01, BDZ00, BI97, Gia00] and the references therein for these\nand many more results about harmonic crystals and various generalizations\nof the harmonic crystal. For an analog of the Green's function interpretation of variance that applies in the continuum case (known as the Dynkin\nisomorphism theorem), see [Dyn83, Dyn84a, Dyn84b].\n\n4.2\n\nDiscrete approximations: triangular lattice\n\nSuppose d = 2, and let L be the standard triangular lattice (the dual of the\nhoneycomb lattice). Now, suppose we restrict the GFF on D to the \u03c3-algebra\nFHn where Hn (D) is the set of continuous functions that are affine on the\neach of triangles of n1 L and that vanish on the boundary of D. Since Hn (D)\nis a finite dimensional Hilbert space, it is self-dual, and hence a sample from\nthe GFF determines an element hn of Hn (D), with probability proportional\nto exp[\u2212khn k2\u2207 ]. Observe also that hn is determined by its \u221avalues on the\nP\nvertices of the triangular mesh, and that khn k2\u2207 is equal to 63 |hn (j) \u2212\nhn (i)|2 + |hn (k) \u2212 hn (i)|2 + |hn (k) \u2212 hn (j)|2 where the\n\u221a sum 2is over all triangles\n(i, j, k) in the mesh. (The area of each triangle is 3/(4n ) and the gradient\nsquared is 23 n2 [|hn (j) \u2212 hn (i)|2 + |hn (k) \u2212 hn (i)|2 + |hn (k) \u2212 hn (j)|2 ].) Since\neach interior\nedge of D is contained in two triangles, this is also equal to\nP\n\u22121/2\n3\n|hn (j) \u2212 hn (i)|2 , where the sum is taken over nearest neighbor pairs\n(i, j).\nIn other words, hn is distributed like 31/4 times the harmonic crystal (with\nunit weights) on the set of vertices of n1 L \u2229 D, where the boundary vertices\nare precisely those that lie on a triangle which is not completely contained\nin D.\nIt is not hard to see that the union of the spaces Hn (D) is dense in H(D),\nand that for any function f \u2208 H(D), f minus its projection onto Hn (D) will\ntend to zero in n. Thus, the hn are approximations of h in the sense that\n22\n\n\ffor any fixed f \u2208 H(D), we have (hn , f )\u2207 \u2192 (h, f )\u2207 almost surely. For any\nfixed n, it easy to define contour lines of the continuous function hn .\n\n4.3\n\nDiscrete approximations: other lattices\n\nNow, again, suppose that d = 2 but that we replace the standard lattice with\nany doubly periodic triangular lattice L\u2032 (i.e., a doubly periodic planar graph\nin which all faces are triangles). Once again, we can restrict the GFF to the\nfunctions that are linear on the triangles of n1 L\u2032 . In this case, the heights\nat the corners turn out to have the same law as a harmonic crystal on this\ntriangular lattice graph in which the weight w(e) corresponding to a given\nedge e is given by w(e) = [cot(\u03b81 ) + cot(\u03b82 )]/2, where \u03b81 and \u03b82 are the angles\nopposite e in the two triangles that are incident to e. (Note, of course, that\nthe weights are unchanged by constant rescaling.)\nThat is (as the reader may verify), the discrete Dirichlet energy\nX\n(hn , hn )\u2207 =\nw((x, y))[hn (y) \u2212 hn (x)]2 ,\nwhere hn is viewed as a function on the graph, is the same as the continuous\nDirichlet energy (hn , hn )\u2207 , where hn is extended piecewise linearly to all of\nD.\nIn particular, we can get the discrete GFF on a square grid by dividing each square into a pair of triangles (either direction). In this case, the\ndiagonal edges have w(e) = 0, since both \u03b81 and \u03b82 are right angles. The\nvertical and horizontal edges have w(e) = 1, since \u03b81 and \u03b82 are equal to 45\ndegrees in this case. (Note that w(e) can be negative if one or both of the \u03b8i\nexceeds 90 degrees. Earlier, we assumed that w was positive; however, since\nthe quadratic form corresponding to such a w is still positive definite, the\ndefinition of the harmonic crystal still makes sense in this setting.)\nSimilar results hold when d > 2 if we replace triangles with d-dimensional\nsimplices.\n\n4.4\n\nComputer simulations of harmonic crystals\n\nOne fortunate feature of the discrete Gaussian free fields is the ease with\nwhich they can be simulated on computers. Consider first the special case\nthat \u039b is an m \u00d7 n torus grid graph. In this case, the discrete exponential\nfunctions form an orthogonal basis of the set of complex, mean-zero functions\n23\n\n\fon \u039b, so the elements in a discrete Fourier transform of a discrete GFF on \u039b\nare independently distributed Gaussians with easily computed variances. For\nexample, the Mathematica code shown below generates and plots an instance\nof the discrete GFF on an m \u00d7 n torus.\nListPlot3D[ Re[Fourier[Table[\n(InverseErf[2 Random[]-1]+I InverseErf[2 Random[]-1]) *\nIf[j+k==2,0,1/Sqrt[(Sin[(j-1)*Pi/m]^2+ Sin[(k-1)* Pi/n]^2)]],\n{j,m}, {k,n}]]]]\nThe code generates a complex GFF and then plots its real part. To parse\nthe code, note that the second line simply produces a complex Gaussian\nrandom variable in Mathematica. For each 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n, the third\nline gives one over the gradient norm of the discrete exponential (x, y) \u2192\n\u03b7 (j\u22121)x \u03b6 (k\u22121)y (where \u03b7 and \u03b6 are mth and nth roots of unity, respectively)\non the m \u00d7 n torus (unless j = k = 1, in which case it gives zero). The\nFourier transform of the corresponding matrix is the Gaussian free field on\nthe torus. Now suppose \u039b is a simply connected induced subgraph of the\ntorus with values h0 assigned to its boundary; to sample a GFF on \u039b with\nthese boundary values, one may first sample an instance h of the GFF on\nthe torus and then replace h with h + h\u0303 where h\u0303 is the discrete harmonic\ninterpolation of the function h0 \u2212 h (defined on \u2202\u039b) to all of \u039b. The most\ntime-consuming part of this algorithm is computing the discrete harmonic\ninterpolation (but it is not hard to compute an approximate interpolation).\n\n4.5\n\nCentral limit theorems for random surfaces\n\nKenyon in [Ken01] proved that random domino tiling height functions (in\nregions with certain kinds of boundary conditions) converge to the GFF as\nthe mesh size gets finer. (To be precise, [Ken01] studies random discrete\nheight functions h\u01eb -for which the lattice spacing is \u01eb-and shows that for\nsmooth density functions \u03c1, (h\u01eb , \u03c1) converges in law to (h, \u03c1) = (h, \u2212\u2206\u22121 \u03c1)\u2207 .)\nAlso, [NS97, GOS01] give a similar Gaussian free field convergence result for\na class of discretized random surfaces known as Ginzburg-Landau \u2207\u03c6\nrandom surfaces or anharmonic crystals and [GOS01] shows further\n24\n\n\f2\n20\n0\n15\n\n-2\n10\n\n5\n10\n5\n15\n20\n\nFigure 4.1: Discrete Gaussian free field on 20 by 20 grid with zero boundary\nconditions.\nthat certain time-varying versions of these processes converge to the dynamic\nGFF.\nSee [She05] for more references on random surface models (assuming both\ndiscrete and continuous height values) with convex nearest neighbor potential\nfunctions and discussion of the division of the so-called gradient Gibbs\nmeasures into smooth phases (in which the variance of the height difference\nbetween two points is bounded, independently of the distance between those\npoints) and rough phases (in which the variance of these height differences\ntends to infinity as the points get further apart). An important open question\nis whether every two-dimensional rough phase has a scaling limit given by a\nlinear transformation of the GFF.\n\nReferences\n[Ada75]\n\nRobert A. Adams. Sobolev spaces.
