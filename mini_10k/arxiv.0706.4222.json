Indeed, one can extract (see, for example, [2, 3]) in such a\ncontext the quark structure function of the pion and test the process independence of the\nnucleon structure function measured in deeply inelastic scattering.\nOn the other hand, for large Q2 and large longitudinal momentum (carried by a pion's\nquark constituent) the hadronic differential cross section for the production of a massive\nlepton pair via the annihilation of an antiquark and a quark in the colliding hadrons-\npion and nucleon, respectively-involves the pion distribution amplitude (DA) in order to\ndescribe the pion bound state. Tuning the DY reaction to the kinematic edge of the phase\nspace, where the antiquark \u016b from the pion is far off-shell, i.e., x\u016b \u2192 1, it is sufficient to\ntreat the quark u, originating from the nucleon, as being nearly free and on-mass-shell, so\nthat the bound-state details of the nucleon become irrelevant [4]. In those circumstances\nthe process MB \u2192 l+ l\u2212 X reduces to \u03c0 \u2212 u \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 X and the corresponding amplitude\nbecomes calculable within perturbative QCD. The binding effects of the pion state are taken\ninto account by means of the pion DA (which is the pion wave function integrated over\ntransverse momenta), making this type of process suitable to test the details of proposed\nnonperturbative models for the pion DA.\nMoreover, the angular distribution of the produced lepton pair (actually the \u03bc+ ), relative\nto the pion direction, depends in a sensitive way on the pion DA. Hence, measuring the\nangular distribution parameters \u03bb, \u03bc, \u03bd (for an unpolarized target) and \u03bc\u0304, \u03bd\u0304 (for longitudinally\npolarized protons), one can extract useful information on the shape of the pion DA [5, 6].\nThis is particularly important with regard to a proposed experiment by the COMPASS\ncollaboration to collect high-precision data from the scattering of a pion beam off a polarized\ntarget [7].\nIn the present work we will consider (i) the inclusive production of dimuons from the\nhard scattering of pions on an unpolarized nuclear target and (ii) an analogous process with\nlongitudinally polarized protons. The appearance of a single transverse-spin asymmetry in\nthe latter case is related to an imaginary part, which, may even dominate the dimuon angular\ndistribution [6]. Because this contribution is very sensitive to the pion DA, the single-spin\nasymmetry can be used in conjunction with the experimental data in order to select the\nmost preferable pion DA. Our attention is focused in both cases on the role played by the\npion bound state in terms of the pion DA.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we present the theoretical background of the DY model in \u03c0N collisions, taking into account the valence-quark bound state\nof the pion, which we model with the aid of nonlocal QCD sum rules [8] in comparison with\nthe Chernyak\u2013Zhitnitsky [9] model and the asymptotic pion DA [10, 11, 12]. Section III\ncontains the presentation of our results for the angular distribution parameters \u03bb, \u03bc, \u03bd, and\ncomparison with the data from the E615 experiment at Fermilab [3]. In this section, we also\nmake predictions for the angular parameters \u03bc\u0304 and \u03bd\u0304, using the aforementioned pion DAs.\nParticular attention is devoted to the endpoint behavior of different pion DAs by considering\nan azimuthal moment of the pion DA, discussed before in [6]. Finally, our conclusions are\nprovided in Sec. IV.\n\n2\n\n\fII.\n\nDRELL\u2013YAN PROCESS OF DIMUON PRODUCTION\n\nThis section describes the theoretical method used to calculate the angular distribution\nof the \u03bc+ in the DY process in a \u03c0N collision in terms of the parameters \u03bb, \u03bc, \u03bd (unpolarized\ntarget) and \u03bc\u0304, \u03bd\u0304 (longitudinally polarized protons).\n\n\u03c0 \u2212(p)\n\nd(x\u0304\u016bp \u2212 qT )\n\nd(\u0233p)\n\ng((x\u016b \u2212 y)p + qT )\n\u016b(x\u016bp + qT )\n\n\u016b(yp)\nu(xuP )\nN (P )\n\n\u03b3 \u2217(q)\n\n\u03bc+\n\n\u03bc\u2212\n\nFIG. 1: Graphical representation of the Drell\u2013Yan process \u03c0 \u2212 N \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 X. Symbols p = p\u03c0 ,\nP = pN and q = \u2212xu P + x\u016b p + qT , where x\u016b = x\u03c0 , and xu = xN (see for details Sec. II A), mean\nfour-momenta. Here, and below, solid lines denote leptons and also the quarks emerging from the\n\u03c0N collision, double lines indicate bound states (with their corresponding wave functions being\nillustrated by shaded blobs), whereas the (red) curly line stands for the exchanged hard gluon and\nthe (blue) weavy line represents the highly virtual photon.\n\nThe DY process is the dominant mechanism to produce lepton pairs with a large invariant\nmass Q2 in hadronic collisions, like \u03c0 \u00b1 N scattering. In the context of this model a massive\nlepton (muon) pair is created through the electromagnetic annihilation of an antiquark from\nthe beam pion and a quark from the nucleon target, as depicted in Fig. 1. Moreover, in\nthe kinematic region of large x\u03c0 = x\u016b \u2192 1 (or xL \u2192 1, see next section), the antiquark in\nthe pion is subject to bound-state effects encoded in the valence-quark pion DA, while the\nquark from the nucleon is nearly on shell. Then, the pion bound state can be resolved via\nhard-gluon exchange between the annihilating antiquark and the spectator in convolution\nwith the pion DA [5], displayed diagrammatically in Fig. 2. This provides a means to test the\nvalidity of proposed models for the pion DA, derived from nonperturbative QCD calculations,\nbecause the angular distribution of the produced muon pair depends in a sensitive way on the\nshape of the pion DA. Contributions from higher-order hard-gluon exchange are suppressed\nby powers of \u03b1s and will be ignored; those due to evolution will be taken into account in\nleading order (LO). Alternatively, ignoring chromodynamic binding effects, one may extract\nin the context of the DY model, the structure functions of the pion and the nucleon [3, 4]\nor focus on quark density functions [4, 13]. These issues are outside the scope of the present\ninvestigation.\nTo continue with our quantitative analysis, we first present some explanations on the\nkinematics of the DY process together with the definitions of the dynamical parameters\nwhich describe the angular distribution in the hadronic differential cross section.\n\n3\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\n\u03c0\u2212\n\nd\n\n\u03c0\u2212\n\nd\n\n\u03bc+\n\ng\n\ng\n\u016b\n\n\u03bc+\n\n\u016b\n\n\u03b3\u2217\n\u03bc\u2212\n\n\u03b3\n\n\u2217\n\nu\n\nu\n\n\u03bc\u2212\n\nFIG. 2: Leading (perturbative) contributions to the QCD-amplitude describing the Drell\u2013Yan\nprocess \u03c0 \u2212 N \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 X at large Q2 and xL , the latter defined in Eq.

As\nx\u016b \u2192 1 (i.e., \u016b far off-shell), p2\u016b becomes large and far spacelike.\n\u2022 x\u016b : Longitudinal momentum fraction (light-cone variable) of the annihilating \u016b from\nthe meson. In the kinematical regime, we are considering, x\u016b = x\u03c0 .\n\u2022 < k2T >: Average of the square of the transverse momentum of the annihilating \u016b from\nthe meson (k2T \u226a Q2 ).\n\u2022 pu : Momentum of the annihilating quark u emerging from the nucleon, pu = xu P .\nBecause x\u016b \u2192 1, it is sufficient to consider the u-quark to be nearly free and on-shell:\nxu = xN (quark masses and transverse momenta neglected).\n\u2022 Q \u2261 m\u03bc\u03bc : Invariant mass of the massive lepton (muon) pair, or, equivalently, momentum of the virtual photon created by the annihilated quarks (Q2 = q 2 ). In this analysis\nwe consider values in the range Q2 = (4 \u2212 81) GeV2 .\n\u2022 s: Squared invariant mass of the initial hadrons, i.e., s = (p + P )2 . In our numerical\nanalysis we use s = 100 \u2212 400 GeV2 , which covers the 252 GeV \u03c0 \u2212 beam of the E615\nCollaboration at Fermilab [3].\nMasses\n\u2022 m\u03c0 : Pion mass. Because s \u226b m2\u03c0 , we set m\u03c0 = 0.\n4\n\n\f\u2022 m: Bare quark mass.

Then, in order to separate both terms unambiguously, one has to demand\nthat qT should not contain any part of the pion momentum p, cf. Eq. (2.6).\n\u221a\n\u2022 xL = 2QL / s < 1: Longitudinal momentum fraction (Feynman x) of the lepton pair\n(associated with the virtual photon) in the hadron c.m.f. (Q2L = qL2 ). QL and QT are\nthe photon-momentum components parallel and perpendicular, respectively, to the\nincident pion momentum in the hadron c.m.f.\n\u2022 xF = x\u03c0 \u2212 xN and x\u03c0 xN = \u03c4 . Neglecting the quark transverse momentum and\nmass (as s becomes very large), the quantities x\u03c0 and xN can be identified with\nx\nCombining the two equations above, one finds [3] x\u03c0,N =\nh \u016b and xu , respectively.\ni\n\u00b1xF + (x2F + 4\u03c4 )\n\n1/2\n\n/2.\n\nAngular distribution parameters\n\u2022 \u03b8: Polar angle measuring the \u03bc+ direction with respect to the t-channel (or Gottfried\u2013\nJackson system of axes), i.e., cos \u03b8 = p\u0302\u03bc * p\u0302\u03c0 . The definitions of other choices of axes\n(frames) can be found, e.g., in [3].\n\u2022 \u03c6: Azimuthal angle between the massive lepton-pair plane and the plane of the incident\nhadrons in the lepton rest frame.\n\u2022 \u03bb, \u03bc, \u03bd: Angle-independent coefficients, depending on Q2 and xL . These three parameters control the dilepton angular distribution and are sensitive to the shape of the\npion DA.\n\u2022 \u03bc\u0304, \u03bd\u0304: Angle-independent coefficients, depending on Q2 and xL , induced by the imaginary part to the DY amplitude in the polarized case. They are sensitive to the shape\nof the pion DA.\nIn our analysis we consider values of s much larger than the nucleon mass, s \u2265 100 m2N ,\nso that this be neglected, though we derive the exact result with m2N 6= 0 and proceed then\nwith the approximate expression with mN = 0, where it is applicable. The momenta p and\nP are on the light-cone and, hence, we have\np2 = 0 ,\n\nP 2 = m2N \u2248 0 ,\n\n2(p * P ) = s \u2212 m2N \u2261 s\u0303 \u2248 s .\n\n(2.1)\n\nFor the cross-section calculation, one can appeal to the optical theorem and set the upper\nright line in Fig. 1, denoting the d-quark, on mass shell.

We also see that a non-zero nucleon\nmass is important only at very small x\u016b \u2243 m2N /s. At this value of x\u016b the value of xu is close\nto 1, so that, neglecting mN , one finds 1/ [1 + (m2N /Q2 )/(1 + \u03c12 )]. Hence, the difference can\nbe sizable and, especially at Q2 \u223c 2m2N and \u03c1 \u223c 1, it can reach as much as 20%.\nIn the following considerations (and, in particular, in the analysis of the polarized DY\nprocess), we will use the longitudinal-momentum fraction of the photon, xL . To this end,\nrecall that in the hadron c.m.f. one has\n\u221a\n\u221a\ns\ns\np=\n(1, 0, 0, +1) , P =\n(1, 0, 0, \u22121) , q\u22a5 = (0, q\u22a51 , q\u22a52 , 0)\n(2.5)\n2\n2\nand, using Eq.

The second\nwork focused on the possibility of longitudinally polarized protons as a target and discussed\nadditional angular parameters that vanish for an unpolarized target. It was argued that\nfuture polarized experimental data on these processes may be able to distinguish among\nvarious pion DAs because of the high sensitivity of these parameters to the particular shape\nof the pion DA. Though there is still no such data available, meanwhile important knowledge\nhas been collected that is rather unfavorable for the endpoint-dominated type of two-humped\npion DAs, like the CZ one. For instance, new high-precision lattice simulations [14, 15, 16]\ngive a new level of detail for the second Gegenbauer coefficient a2 , yielding values around\n0.2 to 0.24 at a momentum scale of 2 GeV, well within the range suggested by the nonlocal\nQCD sum-rule estimates [8]-hereafter referred to as BMS-and supported by the analysis\nin [17, 18, 19] of the CLEO data [20] on the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 transition form factor using light-cone\nQCD sum rules. This a2 value is about two times smaller than its counterpart of the CZ pion\nDA and cast serious doubts about the consistency of this model with experiment. Moreover,\nthe aforementioned BMS CLEO-data analysis has confirmed the earlier Schmedding and\nYakovlev [21] findings which excluded the CZ pion DA at least at the 2\u03c3 level. On the\nother hand, the asymptotic pion DA seems to be also excluded, given that its Gegenbauer\ncoefficient a2 is identically zero and the CLEO-data analysis relegates this DA outside the 2\u03c3\nerror ellipse (for the most recent rigorous analysis, see [19]), while being also incompatible\nwith the lattice results [14, 15, 16]. Further theoretical arguments and details can be found\nin [22]. See also [23] for a recent development of the nonlocal QCD sum-rule approach and\nthe extraction of the pion DA.\nTherefore, it would seem reasonable and timely to upgrade the calculation of the DY\nangular parameters of the \u03c0 \u2212 N hard-scattering process by taking into account the recent\ndevelopments quoted above. To continue, we first recall the definition of the pion DA,\n\u03c6\u03c0 (y, \u03bc20), which specifies the fractional longitudinal momentum y of the valence-quark constituents in the pion at the normalization scale \u03bc20 . At the (leading) twist-two level it is\ndefined by the following matrix element\nZ 1\n\u0001\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n \u0304\n= iP f\u03c0\nh0 | d(z)\u03b3\n\u03b35 C(z, 0)u(0) | \u03c0(P )i\ndy eiy(zP ) \u03c6\u03c0 y, \u03bc20 ,\n(2.11)\nz 2 =0\n0\nZ 1\n\u03c6\u03c0 (y, \u03bc20) dy = 1 ,\n(2.12)\n0\n\nwhere f\u03c0 = 130.7 \u00b1 0.4 MeV [24] is the pion decay constant defined by\n+\n \u0304\nh0|d(0)\u03b3\n\u03bc \u03b35 u(0)|\u03c0 (P )i = ip\u03bc f\u03c0 .\n\n(2.13)\n\nAbove,\npath-ordered\nFock\u2013Schwinger connector [25] (Wilson line) C(0, z) =\n\u0002 a straight\n\u0003\nRz\nP exp \u2212igs 0 ta Aa\u03bc (y)dy \u03bc has been inserted to preserve gauge invariance of the operator\nproduct. In the following, we use the light-cone gauge which reduces the contribution of the\nWilson line to unity. The normalization scale, \u03bc20 , of the pion DA is related to the ultraviolet\n(UV) regularization of the quark-field operators on the light cone in (2.12), whose product\nbecomes singular for z 2 = 0.\n7\n\n\fThe pion DA cannot be derived from first principles, but has to be inferred from nonperturbative QCD models (or from experiment). This not withstanding, its evolution is\ngoverned by perturbative QCD [10, 11, 12] and can be expressed in the form\nZ 1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u03c6\u03c0 (y, \u03bc ) = U(y, s; \u03bc , \u03bc0 ) \u2297 \u03c6\u03c0 (s, \u03bc0) ,\n\u2297\u2261\nds ,\n(2.14)\ns\n\ns\n\n0\n\nwhere \u03c6\u03c0 (s, \u03bc20 ) is a nonperturbative input determined at some low-energy normalization\npoint \u03bc20 \u223c 1 GeV2 , where the local operators in Eq. (2.11) are renormalized, while\nU(y, s; \u03bc2, \u03bc20 ) is the evolution operator from that scale to the observation scale \u03bc, calculable in QCD perturbation theory. In the asymptotic limit, the shape of the pion DA is\ncompletely fixed by pQCD to be \u03c6asy\n\u03c0 (y) = 6y(1 \u2212 y) [10, 11, 12], with the nonperturbative\ninformation being solely contained in the pion-decay constant f\u03c0 .\nIn the leading-twist approximation of the pion DA, in which we are working, \u03c6\u03c0 (y, \u03bc20)\ncan be expressed in terms of the Gegenbauer polynomials, which form an orthonormal set\nof eigenfunctions. Then,\nh\ni\n3/2\n3/2\n2\n2\n2\n\u03c6\u03c0 (y, \u03bc0) = 6y(1 \u2212 y) 1 + a2 (\u03bc0 ) C2 (2y \u2212 1) + a4 (\u03bc0 ) C4 (2y \u2212 1) + . . . , (2.15)\nwith all nonperturbative information being encapsulated in the expansion coefficients an .\nDepending on the nonperturbative approach applied, these coefficients can be calculated via\nQCD sum rules [9], QCD sum rules with nonlocal condensates [8], or lattice simulations\n[14, 15, 16, 26]. More details can be found in the original papers already cited, while we here\nrestrict ourselves to the obtained results, which we quote in Table I. The shapes of these\nDAs are displayed in the left panel of Fig. 3, whereas the evolution effect is illustrated in\nthe right panel of this figure in terms of the BMS pion DA. Note that the underlying quark\nvirtuality employed, is \u03bb2q = 0.4 GeV2 [17] corresponding to a correlation length of the scalar\nquark nonlocal condensate of about 0.31 fm. As one anticipates from this figure, the key\ncharacteristic of the BMS-type pion DAs is that the endpoint region x \u2192 0, 1 is strongly\nsuppressed-not only relative to the CZ pion DA, but even with respect to the asymptotic\none (for mathematical details, see [22]). In contrast, the double-humped shape-reminiscent\nof the CZ pion DA-turns out to be of minor importance [27].\nTABLE I: Pion DA models used in the analysis.\n\u03c0\u2013DAs|\u03bc2 =1\na2\na4\nhigher\n\nGeV2\n\nasymptotic\n\nBMS [8]\n\n0\n0\n0\n\n0.20\n\u22120.14\nnegligible\n\nBMS \"bunch\" [8, 18]\n[0.13, 0.25]\n[\u22120.04, \u22120.22]\nnegligible\n\nCZ [9]\n0.56\n0\n0\n\nLet us now make some remarks on the evolution of the pion DA in LO of perturbative\nQCD.

The green solid line inside the \"bunch\" represents the BMS model [8].

We will have more\nto say about the choice of the evolution scale in the next subsection. Note also that the\ndenominators in Eqs. (2.24) and (2.25) originate from the gluon and quark propagators in\nthe subprocesses shown in Fig. 2, respectively. Before presenting results for these angular\ncoefficients, let us first discuss what changes are induced when the nuclear target is polarized.\nD.\n\nDY reaction with longitudinally polarized protons\n\nIn the polarized DY process the angular distribution of the \u03bc+ contains two additional\nparameters \u03bc\u0304 and \u03bd\u0304, entering additively Eq.

Note that\nall momenta refer to the hadronic c.m.f. The polarized parton distributions used in our\n10\n\n\fanalysis are taken from [28], whereas for the unpolarized structure functions we use the\nparameterization of Ref. [29]. To evolve these distributions from their normalization scale\n\u03bc20 = 4 GeV2 to the scale \u03bc2 = Q2 = 16 GeV2 , we employed the Fortran codes supplied by\nthe authors of these papers on the Durham web site.1\nLacking radiative corrections to the process under study, we cannot fix the evolution scale\nunambiguously. In an effort to get a measure for the entailed uncertainty, we have analyzed\nthe dependence of our results on the choice of the evolution scale by varying \u03bc2 in the range\n\u03bc2 = Q2 /2 and \u03bc2 = 2Q2 . We found that, depending on the model pion DA used, the\nvariance of the calculated \u03bc\u0304 parameter lies between 2% and 17%, with moderate sensitivity\nto the adopted \u03c1 value. Details are given in Table II for the (large) xL interval, in which\nthe one-gluon exchange is still a good approximation and only the pion bound-state is of\nimportance. Recall in this context that the only evolution effect in the case of the asymptotic\npion DA stems exclusively from the DGLAP evolution of the nucleon parton distributions.\nOn the other hand, in the case of the BMS and the CZ pion DAs, the total evolution effect\nis the result of the combination of the ERBL evolution of the pion DA and the DGLAP\nevolution of the nucleon parton distributions (unpolarized and polarized) in \u03bcnucl (cf.

We also include predictions for the parameter \u03bc\u0304 (versus xL ), which is nonzero only\nin the polarized DY process, and the SSA A.\nAll results were obtained using different models for the pion DA, already mentioned, and\nthey are shown at different values of QT , i.e., at different values of the scaling parameter \u03c1.\nTo be specific, we compare in Fig. 5 our theoretical predictions for \u03bb, \u03bc, \u03bd with experimental data from E615 [3] in that x\u03c0 region reported by this collaboration using a 252 GeV\n\u03c0 \u2212 beam interacting in an unpolarized tungsten target.\nWe used for convenience the Gottfried\u2013Jackson frame and included in our analysis the\ndata sample listed in their Table VIII. Because the range of the probed transverse photon\nmomentum, QT , is in our opinion too large for averaging, we followed another strategy\nthan the authors in Ref. [5]. Notably, we adopted some value of the scaling parameter\n\u03c1 = QT /Q and required the momenta QT and Q to be within the reported window of the\nmeasurement in [3]. We evaluated this way the angular parameters shown in the figures,\nobtained with different pion DAs, including one-loop ERBL evolution with Q2 = m2\u03bc\u03bc , and\nfor three different values of \u03c1 = 0.06, 0.3, 0.5, whereas s = 500 GeV2 in accordance with [3].\nStrictly speaking, the results at too low values of \u03c1 . 0.06 are, actually, not compatible with\nfactorization because then QT becomes of the order of \u039bQCD . They are shown here merely\nfor illustration purposes.\nOne important observation from Fig. 5 is that the parameter \u03bc increases proportionally\nwith \u03c1, as it is qualitatively expected from Eq. (2.20) (though there is an additional term\nproportional to \u03c13 , absent in the parton DY model). This increase turns out to be small for\nthe asymptotic DA [10, 11, 12], whereas it becomes rather too strong for the CZ model [9],\nwhile for the BMS strip [8] this enhancement with \u03c1 is moderate and provides best agree13\n\n\f0.8\n\n1\n\n\u03bc\u0304\n\n\u03bc\u0304\n\n2\n\n\u03bc\u0304\n\n0.8\n1.5\n0.6\n0.6\n1\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.55\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.2\n\n0.6\n\n0.65\n\n0.7\n\n0.75\n\nxL0.8\n\n\u03bc\u0304\n\n0.55\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.65\n\n0.7\n\n0.75\n\nxL0.8\n\n0.55\n\n1\n\n\u03bc\u0304\n\n0.6\n\n0.65\n\n0.7\n\n0.75\n\nxL0.8\n\n\u03bc\u0304\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n0.3\n0.3\n\n0.6\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\nxL\n\n0.9\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\nxL\n\n0.9\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\nxL\n\n0.9\n\nFIG. 7: Evolution effect on the angular parameter \u03bc\u0304(xL , \u03c1) vs. xL in several steps of the scaling\nparameter \u03c1.

Figure 6 shows the predictions for the angular\nparameter \u03bc\u0304 as a function of xL for three different values of \u03c1 = 0.06, 0.3, 0.5 and two centerof-mass-energies s = 100 GeV2 (upper row) and s = 400 GeV2 in the range expected to be\ncovered in the COMPASS experiment. As before, the results shown were obtained for the\nasymptotic, BMS, and CZ pion DAs.

Eq. (2.29)) and display the results in Fig. 8. As mentioned in the\nprevious section, this quantity was proposed in [6] as a sensitive measure for the angular\nmodulation of the pion DA at large xL . One sees from this figure that this seems indeed to\nbe the case, especially for not too small \u03c1 values and, once experimental data will become\navailable, it could potentially serve to discriminate among different pion DAs.\nTo complete the analysis, we include 3D-plots of the parameter \u03bc\u0304 as a function of xL and \u03c1\n\n0.4\n\n\u03c1\n\n0.4\n\n\u03c1\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n\u03c1\n0.2\n2\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n1.5\n\n0.6\n\n\u03bc\u0304\n\n0.4\n\n\u03bc\u0304\n0.2\n\n0.6\n\nxL\n\n0.4\n\nxL\n\n0.2\n0\n\n0.4\n\n0\n0.8\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n0\n\n0\n0.8\nPSfrag replacements\n\n0.6\n\n\u03c1\n\n\u03bc\u0304\n\n0.5\n\n0.2\n\n0\n0.8\nPSfrag replacements\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n1\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n0\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\nxL\n\n\u03c1\n\n0.4\n\n\u03c1\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.6\n0.3\n\n\u03bc\u0304\n\n0.2\n\n\u03bc\u0304\n\n0.4\n\n\u03bc\u0304\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n0.1\n\n0\nPSfrag replacements\n\n0.6\n\nxL\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n0\n\n0 replacements\nPSfrag\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\nxL\n\n0.2\n0\n\n0.2\n0\n\nxL\n\nFIG. 9: 3D-plots of the angular parameter \u03bc\u0304(xL , \u03c1) for three different choices of the pion DA:\nAsymptotic [10, 11, 12] (left), BMS model [8] (center), and CZ model [9] (right).

All assignments are as in Fig. 9.\n\n(Fig. 9) and analogously 3D plots of the angular asymmetry A(\u03c6, xL , \u03c1) versus xl and \u03c6 (Fig.\n10), the latter for \u03c1 = 0.3. Note that both quantities have been evaluated for two different\nvalues of the center-of-the-mass energy s = 100 GeV2 (upper rows) and s = 400 GeV2 (lower\nrows), as expected for the COMPASS experiment [7].\nThe observed increase of A with xL suggests that the single-spin asymmetry of the muonpair angular distribution is associated with the valence Fock-state contributions in the pion\nDA. This behavior is valid for all considered pion DAs and does not significantly depend\non the value of the scaling parameters \u03c1 and \u03c4 , though its size decreases with increasing s.\nWe have verified that the results do not change significantly for larger \u03c1 values. If future\nexperimental data would confirm such a single-spin asymmetry, this would point to a new\nmechanism for generating a new nontrivial phase in QCD factorization leading to T-odd spin\nasymmetries that mimics the effect of a true T violation.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nOur objective in this work was (i) to update previous results on the unpolarized\n\u03c0 N \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 X DY process and (ii) to make detailed predictions for the angular distribution parameters for the hard-scattering of pions on longitudinally polarized protons. The\nsingle-spin asymmetry, predicted here for various pion distribution amplitudes, may soon\nbecome amenable to experimental check at COMPASS. To this end, we have presented an\nupdated analysis of the DY process with the inclusion of the pion's DA, the latter based on\nthe theoretical appraisal of the theoretical situation obtained within the context of nonlocal\nQCD sum rules and supported by recent high-precision lattice calculations and other experimental data from the pion-photon transition. Though the existing data on the unpolarized\n\u2212\n\n16\n\n\fDY \u03c0 \u2212 N \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 process cannot single out one particular pion DA with little ambiguity,\nthe \"bunch\" of the BMS DAs, derived from nonlocal QCD sum rules, seems to comply most\nfavorably with the E615 data. Given the distinctive behavior of all considered pion DAs\nwith respect to the longitudinal momentum fraction, carried by the annihilating quark from\nthe pion in the polarized DY process, one may hope that measuring the angular moment\nin the planned COMPASS experiment may lend quantitative support for one or the other\nproposed pion DA.\nOn the other hand, it is also important to consider another (and actually the most common) mechanism of the \u03c0 + N Drell\u2013Yan process, treating the pion structure in terms of\nparton distributions rather then the pion DA. This mechanism is the dominant one at moderate values of xL . There are also related contributions to the SSA due to the imaginary phases\nemerging in the short-distance subprocesses [32, 33]. These contributions have recently been\nstudied for the kinematics of RHIC and J-PARC [34]. The investigation of the relevance of\nthis mechanism in the case of the COMPASS kinematics requires further investigation.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank A. V. Efremov and S. V.
