Studies of maser emission toward star formation regions offer several advantages.\nThe high intensity and small spatial scales of maser spots allow star formation regions to\n14\nbe probed on scales >\n\u223c 10 cm, providing an effective method of studying the kinematics\nof gas associated with forming stars. Furthermore, Zeeman splitting of maser lines provides\ninformation about the magnetic field structure of molecular gas surrounding young massive\nstars, offering the possibility to clarify the role of magnetic fields in the collimation of bipolar\noutflows of massive stars.\nIn many of the regions for which hydroxyl (hereafter OH) masers have been studied\nin detail, their velocity structure and distribution suggests that they trace a dense disk or\nmolecular torus (Hutawarakorn & Cohen 1999; Hutawarakorn et al. 2002; Hutawarakorn &\nCohen 2003, 2005). The magnetic field structure in these regions typically shows a toroidal\ncomponent reversing directions on either side of the disk which appears to support the model\nin which magnetic field lines are twisted by the rotating disk (Uchida & Shibata 1985).\nA case where the main-line OH masers are predicted to instead trace the bipolar outflow\nis toward the massive star formation region G5.89-0.39 (GAL 005.886-00.393 in SIMBAD\nand hereafter referred to as G5.89). G5.89 is a shell-like UC HII region, powered by a young\nmassive star of spectral type O6 or O7 (Wood & Churchwell 1989). A dense (nH2 \u223c104 cm\u22123 ),\nhot (T\u223c90 K), and massive (M\u223c30 M\u2299 ) envelope of dust and molecular gas surrounds the\nionized gas (Gomez et al. 1991; Harvey et al. 1994) and appears to be participating in a\npowerful bipolar molecular outflow (Harvey & Forveille 1988; Cesaroni et al. 1991; Zijlstra\net al. 1990; Acord et al. 1997; Sollins et al. 2004; Watson 2004). Proper motion observations\nof the expansion velocity of G5.89 suggest a distance of \u22432 kpc (Acord et al. 1998). More\nrecently, the distance to G5.89 has been estimated kinematically by Fish et al. (2003) using\nHI absorption features to resolve the near/far kinematic ambiguity. The inferred distance of\n\u22433.8 kpc is consistent with the Acord et al. (1998) estimate within the quoted error bars.\nNevertheless, we adopt the Acord et al. (1998) distance estimate because the kinematic\ndistance method has large uncertainties for sources located near a galactic longitude of\n\u22430\u25e6 . Observations of radio recombination lines suggest an LSR velocity of \u2243 10 km s\u22121\n(Reifenstein et al. 1970; Wood & Churchwell 1989) which we assume to be the systemic\nvelocity of G5.89.\nOH maser emission was detected toward G5.89 with the Very Large Array (VLA) by\nZijlstra et al. (1990) at 1612 MHz, 1665 MHz, and 1667 MHz. Main-line OH maser spectra\nin other sources typically show many components spanning a range of \u223c10 km s\u22121 in radial\nvelocity; toward G5.89, OH maser emission spans a range \u224350 km s\u22121 . The 1667 MHz\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nmaser features extend primarily N-S, perpendicular to a disk-like structure inferred from the\nmorphology of the 6 cm continuum emission. The radial velocities of the masers increase\nwith distance away from the disk-like structure. (Zijlstra et al. 1990) suggest that the\nmain-line OH masers observed toward G5.89 trace an accelerating component of the bipolar\nmolecular outflow. If this interpretation is valid, identification of Zeeman pairs could yield\nthe magnetic field structure along the outflow, allowing valuable constraints to be placed on\nhydromagnetic models for bipolar outflows (Shu et al. 1994).\nRecent observations indicate that such an interpretation may require closer scrutiny.\nThe outflow position angle differs considerably depending on the tracer, ranging from NESW in SiO(5-4) (Sollins et al. 2004), to N-S as traced by C34 S (Cesaroni et al. 1991) to E-W\n(and primarily along the line-of-sight) as traced by CO(1-0) and HCO+ (Watson 2004). The\nsource of the outflow has also been debated. Feldt et al. (2003) detect an O5 star slightly\noffset from the center of the UC HII region and suggest that this object may be the ionizing\nsource of G5.89. Sollins et al. (2004) argue that the outflow is likely not powered by the O5\nstar since the star is not equidistant from the outflow lobes, but rather originates from the\n1.3 mm continuum source detected in their work. However, they cannot distinguish whether\nthe 1.3 mm continuum emission is associated with the UC HII region. Studying the maser\nemission with the spatial resolution offered by very long baseline interferometry could help\nclarify these uncertainties.\nSince the work of Zijlstra et al. (1990), there have been several new studies of main-line\nOH maser emission toward G5.89. Wood (1993) and Argon et al. (2000) observed 1665\nMHz and 1667 MHz OH masers with the VLA in left circular polarization (LCP) and right\ncircular polarization (RCP). The angular resolution of the Wood (1993) and Argon et al.\n(2000) observations was \u22432\u2032\u2032 compared to the 6\u2032\u2032 resolution achieved by Zijlstra et al. (1990);\nhowever, even with 2\u2032\u2032 resolution, it is not possible to reliably identify Zeeman pairs. Fish\net al. (2005) identify Zeeman pairs toward G5.89 using 1665 MHz and 1667 MHz OH masers\nwith the VLBA, but their observations only cover a fraction of the velocity-range in which\nOH masers are known to reside.\nIn an attempt to 1) explore the velocity structure of the gas traced by the OH masers and\n2) characterize the magnetic field of molecular gas surrounding G5.89, we have observed the\n1667 MHz and 1612 MHz OH maser lines toward G5.89 with the Very Long Baseline Array\n(VLBA) of the NRAO1 . The angular resolution (\u223c10 milliarcsecs) and spectral resolution\n(\u22430.2 km s\u22121 at 1612 and 1667 MHz) are sufficient to identify the location of OH maser\n1\n\nThe National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) is a facility of the National Science Foundation\noperated under cooperative agreement by Associated Universities, Inc.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nclumps and identify Zeeman pairs. The observations and reduction techniques are presented\nin \u00a72. In \u00a73 and \u00a74, we present and discuss the results of our OH maser observations toward\nG5.89. Finally, in \u00a75, the results are summarized.\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nThe 1667.35903 MHz (hereafter 1667 MHz) and 1612.23101 MHz (hereafter 1612 MHz)\ntransitions were observed toward G5.89 with the VLBA on 2003 May 13-14. Left and right\ncircular polarizations were observed simultaneously in 1024 spectral channels covering a total\nbandwidth of 1.0 MHz resulting in a channel width of 0.176 km s\u22121 at 1667 MHz and 0.182\nkm s\u22121 at 1612 MHz. At 1667 MHz, only those channels with emission (500-700) were\nimaged. The resulting velocity resolution (1.2 times the channel separation) was 0.218 km\ns\u22121 at 1667 MHz and 0.211 km s\u22121 at 1612 MHz.\nCalibrations and imaging were performed with the NRAO AIPS2 software package.\nAmplitudes were calibrated using on-line system noise temperature and gain curves. Delay\nand bandpass response solutions were found via three scans of the compact continuum source\n3C 345. The maser observations were phase referenced to J1751-2524 (offset 1.3 degrees from\nG5.89) using a cycle time of 6 minutes (3 minutes on G5.89, 3 minutes on J1751-2524). This\nsource has a flux density of 0.67 Jy in the S-band and a positional error of 2.5 mas. The\nuncertainty in the absolute position of bright (\u22431 Jy) maser spots is thus \u223c3 mas.\nA single bright maser spot in each maser transition and polarization was selected for\nself-calibration in each maser transition and polarization. Interstellar scatter broadening\ncauses the self-calibration sources to become resolved on the longer baselines of the VLBA,\nsignificantly reducing the signal to noise and causing the calibration to fail on these baselines. The maser used for self-calibration at 1612 MHz was brighter than that at 1667 MHz\nallowing three more antennas to be calibrated at 1612 MHz. The long baselines available\nfrom the three extra antennas result in a significantly smaller synthesized beam at 1612\nMHz. The resulting synthesized beams of the 1612 MHz and 1667 MHz images are 20 \u00d7 7\nmas at a position angle of 7\u25e6 and 45 \u00d7 15 mas with a 27\u25e6 position angle, respectively. At the\ndistance of G5.89, this corresponds to \u224330 AU at 1612 MHz and \u224350 AU at 1667 MHz. The\nrms noise of the cleaned image is 129 mJy beam\u22121 at 1612 MHz and 49 mJy beam\u22121 at 1667\nMHz.

Details of the observations and instrumental characteristics are presented in Table 1.\n2\n\nThe Astronomical Image Processing System (AIPS) is documented at http ://www.nrao.edu/aips\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nUsing the task JMFIT in AIPS, two-dimensional Gaussians were fit to all peaks detected\nin adjacent channels with significance above 5\u03c3 to identify and calculate the flux density of\neach maser spot. Line profiles were fit using IDL software routines. Maser positions, flux\ndensities, and velocities are listed in Table 2 (1667 MHZ LCP), Table 3 (1667 MHZ RCP),\nand Table 4 (1612 MHz).

The offset between the masers and radio\ncontinuum emission is only known at the level of \u22430.\u2032\u2032 3 (Argon et al. 2000), however the\nabsolute positions of the masers are known at the level of a few mas since they are phase\nreferenced. For ease of discussion, we subdivide the OH maser features into three groups\nprojected on 1) the S-edge of the UC HII (hereafter, G5.89 South) and 2) the E-edge of the\nUC HII region (G5.89 East) and 3) the center of the UC HII region (G5.89 Center). We zoom\nin on the distribution of masers in the center of G5.89 in Figure 3 and in the south of G5.89\nin Figure 4. In Figures 5, 6, and 7 we plot spectra of 1667 MHz averaged over G5.89 South,\nG5.89 East, and G5.89 Center, respectively. The velocities of maser features on the edges of\nthe UC HII region are positive and close to the systemic velocity of 10 km s\u22121 , whereas the\nvelocities of masers projected on the center of the UC HII region are blueshifted by up to\n40 km s\u22121 with respect to the systemic velocity. In \u00a7 4, we will explain this observation as\nan optical depth effect.\nAt 1612 MHz, we observed three masers in both LCP and RCP. The positions of 1612\nMHz OH masers are presented in Table 4, Figure 8 (LCP), and Figure 9 (RCP). The masers\nare projected on the central region of the UC HII region and their line-of-sight velocities\nare \u2243 \u221220 km s\u22121 . Zijlstra et al. (1990) identify 1612 MHz OH masers with roughly the\nsame projected position and line-of-sight velocity. They also identify several weaker masers\nat \u224310 km s\u22121 projected on the southern region of the UC HII region which are outside our\nvelocity coverage and hence not detected in our observations. The \u221220 km s\u22121 component\nwas first observed by Turner (1969). As with Zijlstra et al. (1990), we find that this line\nis divided in several components. While the ratio of flux densities between the different\ncomponents appears to have varied in the fifteen years between the Zijlstra et al. (1990)\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nVLA observations from 1988 and the 2003 VLBA observations that make up this work,\nquantifying the variability is complicated by the different resolutions of the VLA and VLBA.\nThe median deconvolved major axis of the 1667 MHz masers is 16 mas in LCP and\n17 mas in RCP; both values are roughly consistent with the previous measurement of 20\nmas in Fish & Reid (2006). At 1612 MHz, the median deconvolved major axis is 20 mas in\nLCP and 21 mas in RCP. This suggests that many of the 1667 MHz and 1612 MHZ masers\nmay be partially resolved. However, we note that the deconvolved spot parameters may\noverestimate the true spot size (Fish & Reid 2006), in part due to scatter broadening.\nThe OH maser observations presented in this paper were conducted two years after the\nobservations of Fish et al. (2005). Given the large radial velocities of the masers relative\nto the assumed systemic velocity of the system, it is worthwhile to examine whether there\nis a positional displacement between the maser spots observed at 1667 MHz by Fish et al.\n(2005) and those presented in this paper. The data presented in Fish et al. (2005) were\nnot phase referenced so the absolute positions of the masers are unknown. However, the\nrelative positions are known to very high precision, allowing the relative proper motions of\nmasers to be studied. Since Fish et al. (2005) only observe positive velocity features, we are\nlimited to a subset of the masers presented in this paper. We identified twelve LCP and\neleven RCP masers in common between the two datasets. The relative proper motions are\nderived by comparing the relative displacement between these maser features in Fish et al.\n(2005) to those in this paper; if the masers tangential velocities are large, then we would\nexpect the relative displacements to differ between the two epochs. The relative angular\ndisplacement between masers in G5.89-E and G5.89-S increases by 5-6 mas between the two\nepochs. At the distance of G5.89, this proper motion corresponds to 20-30 km s\u22121 . There\nis also significant relative proper motions (>\n\u223c4 mas) between the individual masers in G5.89\n\u22121\nS indicating that these masers may be moving at speeds of >\n\u223c20 km s with respect to one\nanother.\n\n3.2.\n\nMagnetic Field Structure\n\nA catalog of Zeeman pairs was created by identifying all LCP and RCP lines that are\nseparated on the sky by less than \u224390 AU, comparable to the size of our synthesized beam at\nthe distance of G5.89. Observations of W3(OH) (Reid et al. 1980) suggest that this distance\nrequirement is sufficiently rigorous to reliably derive the magnetic field. We only classify\nmasers as Zeeman pairs if the velocity centroiding error of the pair is less than twice the\nvelocity offset between polarizations, where we have taken the velocity centroiding error to\nbe the quadrature sum of the fitted half-width half maximum divided by twice the signal to\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nnoise ratio of the lines. The magnetic field strength is directly related to the velocity offset\nbetween the LCP and RCP components: B = (\u2206v/0.354 km s\u22121 ) mG at 1667 MHz and B\n= (\u2206v/0.120 km s\u22121 ) mG at 1612 MHz. A positive line-of-sight magnetic field (i.e. oriented\naway from the Earth) is assigned to those Zeeman pairs with vRCP > vLCP , and a negative\nmagnetic field is assigned to those with vLCP > vRCP .\nFollowing the method of Hutawarakorn & Cohen (2003), we estimate a <\n\u223c 1.4, 2.0, 6.2\n% probability that any of the Zeeman pairs identified in G5.89 East, Center, and South are\ndue to random spatial overlap of components of opposite polarization. The probability is\nfound by dividing the number of possible pairs in a given region (using the same selection\ncriteria as described above) by the total area of that region and then multiplying by the\nmaximum area of separation over which two masers of opposite polarization are identified\nas Zeeman pairs (the synthesized beam area). The reasonably low probability suggests that\nthe Zeeman pairs in this sample are not likely to be false detections.\nWe find 23 Zeeman pairs in our sample of 1667 MHz masers. Properties of the pairs are\nsummarized in Table 5. All maser velocities quoted in the text and figures of this section\nare corrected for the Zeeman effect. Spectra of two Zeeman pairs from our observations are\ndisplayed in Figure 10. The velocity offset between the LCP and RCP spectra is clearly\nvisible in both spectra. In the bottom panel, the flux density of the LCP component is lower\nthan that in RCP. This effect is commonly observed in other massive star formation regions\n(Moran et al. 1978) and perhaps is a result of velocity or magnetic field gradients causing\ndifferential gain for masers of opposite polarizations (Cook 1968). In a more extreme case,\nthe differential amplification between polarizations may result in a maser line being above\nthe detection threshold in only one polarization, perhaps explaining why just over half of\nthe masers in our survey have identifiable Zeeman pairs.\nIn Figure 11, we overlay the positions of the Zeeman pairs on the 8.5 GHz continuum\nimage. Negative line-of-sight magnetic field strengths are denoted with circles while positive\nline-of-sight magnetic field strenghs are denoted with crosses. Magnetic field strengths vary\nfrom \u22121.97 mG to +1.94 mG across the field of G5.89.\nThe polarity of the field is positive for all three pairs detected in the E group. Two\nof the pairs are part of a clump of negative velocity features (\u221214.96 and \u221216.43 km s \u22121 )\nwith projected separation of only 75 mas, implying typical linear separations of \u223c150 AU.\nThe corresponding line-of-sight magnetic field strengths are 0.52 mG and 1.34 mG. The third\nZeeman pair in the east group is offset 770 mas E of the other pairs. The line-of-sight velocity\nof the pair, 10.03 km s\u22121 is significantly offset from velocities of the other two pairs in the\nregion, while the line-of-sight magnetic field strength, 1.41 mG, is comparable in strength\nand sign to the other pairs.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nEleven Zeeman pairs are found projected on the central region with velocities ranging\nbetween \u221231.32 km s\u22121 and \u221218.74 km s\u22121 . The radial velocities of most of the pairs in\nthis region are centered closely around the median velocity of \u221225.45 km s\u22121 . The magnetic\nfield polarity is positive for all but two of the Zeeman pairs, with amplitudes ranging from\n0.28 mG to 1.49 mG.\nThe field structure derived from the eleven Zeeman pairs in the S group is more complex\nthan the two previously discussed regions. The two southernmost Zeeman pairs have radial\nvelocities ranging from 13.01 km s\u22121 to 13.91 km s\u22121 and line-of-sight magnetic fields of\nnegative polarity. Also in the S group is a collection of nine Zeeman pairs which display an\nordered reversal in magnetic field polarity over 300 mas, roughly \u223c600 AU at the distance\nof G5.89. Such field reversals may arise if OH masers trace a rotating molecular torus\n(Hutawarakorn & Cohen 1999; Hutawarakorn et al. 2002; Hutawarakorn & Cohen 2003,\n2005). In this scenario, the field lines are thought to become entrained in the torus producing\nthe observed toroidal component. This does not appear to be the case toward G5.89 because\nthe the velocity structure does not vary in an ordered fashion across the gas traced by\nthe Zeeman pairs (Figure 12). Pairs with negative field polarity have velocities ranging from\n\u221229.04 to \u221218.04 km s\u22121 while those with positive field polarity have velocities ranging from\n\u221222.08 to \u221218.74 km s\u22121 . Not only do the velocities of the pairs not vary systematically\nwith position, but they also trace gas that is moving at \u224330 km s\u22121 with respect to LSR\nvelocity of G5.89. Hence, we find no indication of rotation in this clump of maser emission.\nWe find good agreement between the magnetic field structure we present in Figure 11\nwith that presented in Fish et al. (2005). In the E-group, Fish et al. (2005) identify 4 pairs\nat 1667 MHz; similar to our observations, all pairs have positive magnetic field polarity with\na median field strength of 1.5 mG. In G5.89-S, Fish et al. (2005) identify 3 pairs that appear\nto be part of the same clump of masers we observe in the south of the region. The field\ndirection is negative for all pairs in this region, with a median field strength of \u22121.5 mG;\nboth measurements are consistent with the observations presented in this paper. Fish et al.\n(2005) only observe masers with positive radial velocities and hence do not detect the masers\nwe identify toward the central region of the UC HII region or those that trace the reversal\nin magnetic field polarity in G5.89-S.\nEach of the 1612 MHz masers is seen in both RCP and LCP. Following the same procedure described for the 1667 MHz masers, we find that the velocity splitting between the\ndifferent polarizations is greater than the velocity centroiding error for only one of the\nmasers (feature number 3). The velocity splitting is 0.13 km s\u22121 , which is only \u224315% of the\nlinewidth. The B-field suggested by the pair is \u22121.05 mG; however, we note that the Zeeman splitting theory changes significantly when the velocity splitting between polarizations\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nis much less than a linewidth, so this value should be considered very uncertain.\n\n3.3.\n\nComparison with Methanol and Water Masers\n\nMethanol (Kurtz et al. 2004) and water (Hofner & Churchwell 1996) masers have also\nbeen detected toward G5.89. The methanol masers do not appear to be associated with\nthe main-line OH masers. While the 1667 MHz and 1612 MHz OH masers are nearly all\nprojected toward the UC HII region, the methanol masers are offset \u223c10 arcseconds N of the\ncenter of the UC HII region, with radial velocities ranging between 2.88 km s\u22121 and 15.48\nkm s\u22121 . The distribution of water masers is primarily elongated NE-SW. Two H2 O features\nare located along the E edge of the UC HII region with similar radial velocities as the 1667\nMHz OH masers in the same region, suggesting a possible association.\n\n4.\n\nDiscussion\n\nPrevious authors have suggested that the main-line OH masers trace a rapidly expanding\nbipolar outflow (Zijlstra et al. 1990; Wood 1993). If they do trace an outflow, we would\nexpect the spatial distribution and velocity structure of the masers to resemble that of the\noutflowing gas.\nThe 1667 MHz OH masers in G5.89 S and G5.89 Center are elongated primarily along\na NE-SW axis (PA=82\u25e6 ) similar to the SiO outflow (Sollins et al. 2004), but are confined to\nan area \u22433 times smaller than that covered by SiO emission. We do not find a continuous\nvelocity gradient along this axis, in contrast to the observations of Zijlstra et al. (1990).\nFurther, the outflow structure suggested by Zijlstra et al. (1990) (northern outflow cone\npointed toward Earth and southern cone pointing away) is of opposite orientation to the SiO\noutflow, where the peak in the red-shifted lobe is located NE of the blue-shifted emission.\nThe factors listed above do not rule out the possibility that the OH masers trace a\nbipolar outflow. The confinement of OH masers to the face of the UC HII region can be\nexplained if the excitation conditions for OH masers only exist very close to the base of the\noutflow, as suggested by Zijlstra et al. (1990), while differences between the SiO(5-4) outflow\nand the outflowing gas traced by the OH masers could simply be due to the molecules tracing\ndifferent components of the gas. However, we suggest that a simpler explanation may be\nthat the OH masers are confined to the postshock region at the interface of the ionized gas\nshell and the ambient molecular material, similar to the models discussed in Elitzur & de\nJong (1978).\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nThe ionized gas appears to be expanding supersonically into the surrounding medium\nwith an expansion velocity of 35 km s\u22121 (Acord et al. 1998). In the idealized case of expansion\nof a neutral shell, we would expect all features projected on the ionized shell to be blueshifted\nwith respect to the systemic velocity of the UC HII region. Redshifted features would not\nappear projected near the central regions because the UC HII region is optically thick at 18\ncm. Those features located at or close to the edge of the UC HII region should have radial\nvelocities comparable to the systemic velocity of the central source.\nBoth of the above predicted characteristics are observed toward G5.89. All masers\nprojected in the central region of G5.89 are blueshifted by 30-42 km s\u22121 with respect to the\nassumed systemic velocity of 10 km s\u22121 , consistent with the expansion velocity of the UC\nHII region, while maser emission projected on the edges of the UC HII region exhibits radial\nvelocities close to the systemic velocity.\nIf the masers do trace an expanding UC HII region, we would expect to observe large\nproper motions between masers located along the edges of the UC HII region and very small\nproper motions for masers in the center of the UC HII region. At present, we only have\nrelative proper motion measurements for masers along the edges of G5.89-E and G5.89-S.\nThe relative motions of these features do suggest that the masers are moving away from each\nother at high speeds (20-30 km s\u22121 ); however, such high expansion speeds are also consistent\nwith a scenario in which the masers trace an outflow. A more definitive test awaits the\ndetermination of the tangential velocities of masers projected on the center of G5.89.\nThe observed magnetic field structure may also be naturally explained in the context of\na neutral shell shocked by the expanding HII region. The ambient molecular gas surrounding\nG5.89 has a density of \u22431.2\u00d7105 cm\u22123 (Cesaroni et al. 1991). The resulting Alfven speed,\nvA \u2243 2 km s\u22121 , is significantly less than the expansion speed of the UC HII region (35\nkm s\u22121 ), indicating that there is significantly more energy in expansion than in the B-field.\nHence, the magnetic field will be swept up and expand along with the ionized gas shell. An\nexpanding shell carrying a magnetic field will have polarity changes on the scale of the shell\ndue to its curvature. For example, a magnetic field that is initially directed N in the plane\nof the sky with no component along the line of sight will develop a positive line-of-sight\ncomponent above the center of expansion and a negative line-of-sight component below the\nexpansion center after being swept up in the expanding ionized shell. This effect may explain\nthe change in polarity observed between the southernmost masers in G5.89 South and those\nlocated several arcseconds N in G5.89 East and G5.89 Center. An illustration of the effect is\npresented in Bourke et al. (2001). The small-scale magnetic field reversal observed in G5.89\nSouth (Figure 10) may arise if the expanding shell crosses the path of a clump of gas in the\nambient medium. In this case a field reversal would occur on the clump size-scale. This\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nhypothesis is supported by the presence of a foreground molecular cloud to the southwest\nof the UC HII region traced in 1.3 mm continuum by Feldt et al. (1999) and in 350 \u03bcm\ncontinuum by Mueller et al. (2002).\n\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe large number (>50) and velocity range (\u224350 km s\u22121 ) of 1667 MHz OH masers\ntoward G5.89 distinguishes this region from other massive star formation regions with OH\nmasers. While it has been previously suggested that the OH masers trace a rapidly expanding\nbipolar outflow, we suggest that the maser emission may alternatively arise in the dense\npostshock region at the interface of the supersonically expanding UC HII region and the\nambient molecular cloud.\nWe identify 23 Zeeman pairs which indicate the presence of <\n\u223c 2 mG magnetic fields.\nAn ordered reversal in magnetic field direction is present in the S region of G5.89. While the\ngeometry hints at a toroidal pattern indicative of a dense disk-like structure, the distribution\nand velocity field of the OH masers suggests that this configuration is likely not the case.\nThe field reversal could alternatively be explained if the expanding shell of ionized gas sweeps\nup the magnetic field lines and crosses the path of a neutral clump, thereby imprinting a\nfield reversal on the clump size-scale.\nWe thank the referee for helpful comments that improved the quality of the paper.\nD.P.S. thanks Debra Shepherd and Christer Watson for useful discussions.
