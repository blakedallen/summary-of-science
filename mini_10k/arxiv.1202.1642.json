Introduction\nThe nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation is used to model a variety of phenomena in different physical\nsystems, see e.g., [LRS, MCL] and references therein. It comes in two versions: the focusing and the\ndefocusing cases. These correspond respectively to the sign of \u03bb in front of the nonlinear term in the\nHamiltonian H of the (isolated) system,\nZ\nZ\n2\u03bb\n2\n2\n(|\u2207u| + m|u| )dx +\nH := H(u, \u016b) =\n|u|p dx,\n(1.1)\np Td\nTd\nwhere p is a positive even integer and m \u2265 0. Here u is a complex valued field (function) on the d-torus:\nTd := [0, 2\u03c0]d after identifying the end points. The time evolution of u satisfies the equation:\ni\n\n\u2202u\n\u2202H\n=\u2212\n\u2202t\n\u2202 \u016b\n= \u2212\u2206u + mu + \u03bb|u|p\u22122 u.\n\n(1.2)\n\n(Note that (1.1) differs from the H in [LRS, MCL] by a factor of 2.)\nIn the defocusing case, \u03bb is positive, H is bounded from below and one then has global existence and\nuniqueness of smooth solutions in d \u2264 4 for appropriate p; more precisely, for p \u2264 4 in d = 4, p \u2264 6 in\nd = 3 and all p in d \u2264 2. This is the case of interest in constructive quantum field theory [GJ].\nThe situation is very different for the focusing case, \u03bb < 0. In this case H is not bounded from\nbelow and there exists a critical pc , pc = 2 + 4/d, such that for p < pc , there are unique global smooth\nsolutions; for p = pc there are unique global smooth solutions with small L2 norm. For p > pc but\np \u2264 2d/(d \u2212 2), one needs to have small H 1 data to have unique global solutions, cf. e.g., [Bo3].\nThis dichotomy carries over to the possible existence of a (non-truncated) Gibbs measure with density\nZ\n2\u03bb\n\u03bc = Z \u22121 exp [\u2212\u03b2\n: |u(x)|p : dx],\n(1.3)\nTd p\nwith respect to the free field Gaussian measure, where \u03b2 > 0 and : : indicates Wick ordering, which is\nneeded for d \u2265 2 and Z \u22121 is a normalization factor.\nThese measures exist for the defocusing case, \u03bb > 0 for all p in d = 1 (without Wick ordering) and for\np \u2264 6 in d = 2, and p \u2264 4 in d = 3 [GJ]. Furthermore, despite the fact that this measure is supported\non rough functions, Bourgain showed that it is invariant under the dynamics given by (1.2) for d \u2264 2\n[Bo1, 2]. This means that the dynamics can be defined (after Wick ordering modification in d = 2) on\na set of full measure with respect to \u03bc.\nThe focusing case is more delicate. Since H is unbounded from below, it is obvious that the measure\n\u03bc cannot exist without some restrictions on its domain. It was shown by Lebowitz, Rose and Speer in\n[LRS] that in d = 1, the Gibbs measure exists for p = 4 when restricted to L2 balls and that it exists for\np = 6 with the additional condition of small |\u03bb|, cf. also [McKV, Z]. In d = 2, Jaffe [J] showed that the\nmeasure exists for p = 3 for real u when restricted to L2 balls and after Wick ordering; while Brydges\nand Slade [BS] showed that this does not work when p = 4.\nIn this paper, we shall deal with both the focusing and defocusing cases when the system is in contact\nwith a heat reservoir of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type at reciprocal temperature \u03b2. This problem was\nstudied in [MCL], whose formulation we shall follow here, cf. also [LRS]. The time evolution is then\ndescribed by the stochastic nonlinear Langevin equation:\ndu + (\u03bd + i)(\u2212\u2206 + m + \u03bb|u|p\u22122 )u dt =\n2\n\np\n2\u03b2 \u22121 \u03bddW,\n\n(1.4)\n\n\fwhere \u03bd \u2265 0 is the friction and W is a complex Wiener process, i.e., white noise in space and time. We\nnote that for the moment, equation (1.4) is formal as it involves a very rough L1 force on the right side.\nTo give a meaning to (1.4), we work in Fourier space and restrict the number of Fourier modes n to\nbe finite and constrain the Hamiltonian so that it remains bounded from below and is locally convex.\nWe enforce this bound on the evolution by imposing appropriate Neumann boundary conditions in\nFourier space. The problem then reduces to a finite dimensional Markov process on a compact space,\nwhose stationary measure is given by a truncated Gibbs measure \u03bcN . This is formulated in sect. 2. We\nnote that for fixed N , exponential approach to \u03bcN without any lower bound on the rate, follows from\ngeneral probabilistic considerations, see [MCL].\nThe main new result of this paper is that the approach to \u03bcN is exponential with an exponent given\nby the size of the spectral gap for the non self-adjoint Fokker-Planck operator, which is uniform in the\ntruncation N . This is proven in sects. 3-5. The proof is made possible by identifying the Fokker-Planck\noperator with a non self-adjoint Witten-Hodge Laplacian and a spectral analysis.\nWe mention that a related Witten-Hodge Laplacian in the self-adjoint setting was introduced by\nSj\u00f6strand [S1] to study correlation functions in equilibrium statistical mechanics and used by Wang [W]\nto study the parabolic Anderson model.\nThe question of what happens to the truncated measure \u03bcN and the dynamics in the limit as N \u2192 \u221e\nis discussed briefly in sect. 6. It appears that in d = 1, the limit will coincide with the \u03bc given in (1.3),\nwhenever the latter exists. The situation in d \u2265 2 is less clear since Wick ordering takes away convexity.\nAcknowledgement. W.-M.W. thanks J. Sj\u00f6strand for several useful conversations. J.L. and W.-M.W.\nthank D.

We now restrict to u such that\nan = 0 for |n| > N and make estimates uniform in N , cf. the remark above (5.1) in sect. 5. Since all\nestimates are uniform, we will generally omit N as a subscript, except in the statements of the Theorem\nand its Corollary. For notational simplicity, we set \u03b2 = 2 and rescale time by (2\u03c0)d .\nWe have the following equation for a:\n\u0227n = \u2212i\n\n\u221a\n\u2202\u03a6\n\u2202\u03a6\n\u2212\u03bd\n+ \u03bd\u0393n ,\n\u2202\u0101n\n\u2202\u0101n\n3\n\n|n| \u2264 N,\n\n(2.2)\n\n\fwhere the \u0393n are independent centered complex Gaussian white noises with\nh\u0393n (t)\u0393\u0304n (t\u2032 )i = 2\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ).\n\n(2.3)\n\nThe Fokker - Planck equation describes the time evolution of the probability density P\u0303 (a, t) with\ninitial distribution P\u0303 (a, 0) for a process given by a stochastic PDE. Conjugating by e\u00b1\u03a6 and setting\nP = e\u03a6 P\u0303 , the Fokker - Planck equation for (2.2) has the form:\n\u2202t P (a, t) + LP (a, t) = 0,\nwhere\nL = \u2212\u03bd\nHere\n\nand\n\nX\nn\n\n\u22022\n+ \u03bdk\u2207\u03a6k2 \u2212 \u03bd\u2206\u03a6 + H\u03a6 ,\n\u2202\u0101n \u2202an\n\n(2.4)\n\u03bd > 0.\n\n(2.5)\n\n\u2207\u03a6 is the vector {\u2202\u0101n \u03a6, \u2202an \u03a6},\nX \u22022\n\u2206\u03a6 =\n\u03a6,\n\u2202\u0101n \u2202an\nn\n\n(2.6)\n\nX\n(\u2202an \u03a6\u2202\u0101n \u2212 \u2202\u0101n \u03a6\u2202an )\n\n(2.8)\n\nH\u03a6 = 2\n\n(2.7)\n\nn\n\nis the Hamiltonian vector field for the (finite dimensional) Hamiltonian \u03a6 and is anti self-adjoint. (All\nindices above are restricted to |n| \u2264 N ). Thus the Fokker - Planck operator L is non self-adjoint. This\nis a distinguishing feature of the present construction.\nIn order for the Gibbs measure \u03bcN \u223c e\u22122\u03a6N (a) to be stationary for the Fokker-Planck equation (2.4)\nin the focusing case, we need to restrict to appropriate\ndomains in a. Toward that end, we define the\n\u221a\nH s balls and the Hamiltonian H-ball of radius B to be the set of a such that, respectively\nX\n(n2s + 1)|an |2 < B, B > 0\n(2.9)\nn\u2208Zd\n\nand\nwhere \u03a6(a) is defined in (2.1).\n\n|\u03a6(a)|/(2\u03c0)d < B,\n\nB > 0,\n\n(2.10)\n\nSince we are considering u such that an = 0 for |n| > N , the sums in (2.9, 2.10) are restricted to\n|n| \u2264 N . We take as our domain the Hamiltonian H-balls and impose adapted Neumann boundary\nconditions on \u2202H \u2013 the energy surface:\n\u03b7 * (\u2212\u03bd\u2207\u03a6 \u2212 \u03bd\u2207 + h\u03a6 )P |\u2202H = 0,\n\n(2.11)\n\nwhere \u03b7 is the normal direction, assuming that it is well-defined and\nh\u03a6 = {2\u2202an \u03a6, \u22122\u2202\u0101n \u03a6}\nis a vector, displayed using the same convention as in (2.6). On occasions, we will also call h\u03a6 the\nHamiltonian vector field. It is important to remark that since h\u03a6 is tangential, the above boundary\ncondition is equivalent to\n\u03b7 * (\u2212\u03bd\u2207\u03a6 \u2212 \u03bd\u2207)P |\u2202H = 0,\n(2.12)\nwhich plays a pivotal role in establishing a spectral gap uniform in N .\n\nIn the focusing case, the H-ball is not necessarily a connected set. The theorem below addresses the\ncomponent that contains the origin. We call it the H0 -ball. In the defocusing case, H0 coincides with\nH.\nOur main results are :\n4\n\n\fTheorem. For d = 1, 2, p \u2208 2N arbitrary, d = 3, p = 4, 6 and d = 4, p = 4, there exist C, c > 0 such\nthat uniformly in N , the Fokker-Planck semi-group satisfies\nke\u2212tLN \u2212 \u03a00 kL(L2 (H0 ),L2 (H0 )) \u2264 Ce\u2212ct ,\n\nt\u22650\n\nfor sufficiently small |\u03bb|, in a given Hamiltonian H0 -balls with the Neumann boundary condition (2.11)\non the Hamiltonian surface \u2202H0 , where \u03a00 is the projection onto the unique ground state of LN :\n\u03c8N = CN e\u2212\u03a6N ,\n2\nand CN is such that the truncated Gibbs measure \u03bcN := \u03c8N\nis normalized:\n\nZ\n\nH0\n\n2\n\u03c8N\n\nY\n\ndan d\u0101n = 1,\n\n|n|\u2264N\n\nand we have indicated explicitly the truncation N on the \u03a6(a) defined in (2.1).\nCorollary. In the defocusing case, the Theorem holds for all \u03bb \u2265 0 under the same conditions on d\nand p.\nWe note that in the 1d focusing case, for p = 4 and 6, the Theorem remains valid with the Hamiltonian\nH0 -ball replaced by an L2 -ball, cf. sect. 6. This is because the Hamiltonian vector field h\u03a6 is also\ntangential to the L2 -sphere and (2.12) remains valid on the sphere. Without dissipation and forcing,\nthis Hamiltonian geometry leads to the conservation of mass, i.e., the L2 norm and energy, essential\nfor the global existence and uniqueness of solutions for subcritical (or critical) dispersive NLS. With\ndissipation and forcing, the conservation laws are no longer there, but it is important to recognize that\nthe geometry remains and is precisely what enables the present construction. The 1d focusing case has\nparticular interest as the limiting measure \u03bc is known to exist [LRS], cf. sect. 6.\nPrevious related results on stochastic NLS, e.g. [EH, KuS, O] pertain either to the focusing L2 subcritical case, namely p \u2264 4, the 1d focusing case, where there are no blow-up solutions, or to the\ndefocusing case. The forces there are smooth in the spatial variable x. So one works directly with\nthe (non-truncated) SNLS. Generally speaking, this approach does not yield the explicit form of the\ninvariant measure. For results in the purely dissipative case, cf. [DD].\nEquation (1.3) balances dissipation with a rough force. The main novelty of the present construction\nis to work directly in the phase - space (the cotangent bundle) using the Fokker - Planck operator\nand impose boundary conditions there. This enables us to smooth the rough force by convexity of the\nHamiltonian and treat the critical cases.\n3. Sobolev embedding and convex Hamiltonian\nWe establish convexity of \u03a6 uniformly in N and prove\nProposition. Under the same conditions on d and p as in the Theorem, the Hessian of the truncated\n\u03a6 satisfies\ncI < Hess \u03a6 := \u03a6\u2032\u2032 < CI,\n(3.1)\nin the H 1 ball defined in (2.9), where c, C > 0 are constants which do not depend on N , if |\u03bb| is\nsufficiently small. Here Hess \u03a6 is considered as an operator on l2 ([\u2212N, N ]d ) \u00d7 l2 ([\u2212N, N ]d ). If \u03a6 is\ndefocusing, then \u03bb can be taken to be 1 and C = C(B).\n5\n\n\fProof.

The Witten-Hodge Laplacian and spectral gap\nWe now prove that the Fokker-Planck operator L in (2.5) restricted to Hamiltonian H-balls defined\nin (2.9) has a spectral gap uniform in N when the Hamiltonian is convex. We use the Witten-Hodge\nLaplacian formulation introduced in a related context in [S1]. We summarize some of the basic notions\nin the Appendix using the self-adjoint setting.

This is occasionally dubbed the supersymmetric approach, cf. e.g. [TT-NK] for the physics\nliterature.\nLet the Hamiltonian H-ball be as defined in (2.10) and as before, H0 -ball the connected component\ncontaining the origin. The following basic spectral characterization of the Fokker -Planck operator\nfollows readily from (4.2).\n7\n\n\fLemma 1. Assume H0 is a convex set. The spectrum of L in this ball with the Neumann boundary\ncondition (2.11) is contained in the sector\n{\u03ba \u2208 C|Re\u03ba \u2265 \u03bd|Im\u03ba|},\n\n(4.4)\n\nand 0 is a simple eigenvalue.\nProof. The spectrum of L, \u03c3(L) is contained in the numerical range of L:\n{(u, Lu) \u2208 C|u in the domain of L}.\nFrom (4.2) for all u in the domain of L satisfying the Neumann boundary condition (2.11),\nZ\nZ\n(0)\n2\n(d\u03a6 u)2 dad\u0101,\n|d\u03a6 u| dad\u0101 + i Im\n(u, Lu) = (u, \u2212\u2206\u03a6,A u) = \u03bd\n\n(4.5)\n\nH0\n\nH0\n\nwhere (d\u03a6 u)2 denotes the sum of the square of components, with each component defined as in (4.1).\nEquation (4.5) implies (4.4), since (4.5) equals zero if and only if d\u03a6 u = 0, this means u is a multiple\nof e\u2212\u03a6 , which concludes the proof.\n\u0003\nUsing the Witten-Hodge Laplacian (4.3) on 1-forms, we have, moreover, the following spectral gap\nlemma, essential for the proof of the Theorem.\nLemma 2. Assume that in the H0 -ball, \u03a6\u2032\u2032 satisfies cI < \u03a6\u2032\u2032 < CI for some c, C > 0.

Operating on equation (4.6) using d\u03a6 and taking the scalar product\nwith d\u03a6 u , we have\n(d\u03a6 u, [d\u03a6 d\u2217,A\n\u03a6 ]d\u03a6 u) = \u03ba(d\u03a6 u, d\u03a6 u).\nWriting v for d\u03a6 u, we have equivalently\n(1)\n\n(0)\n\n(v, \u2212\u2206\u03a6,A v) = (v, [\u2212\u2206\u03a6,A \u2297 I + 2\u03a6\u2032\u2032 \u25e6 At ]v) = \u03ba(v, v),\nwhere we used (4.2).\nTaking the real part of (4.6), we obtain\n(0)\n\nRe \u03bakvk2 = (v, [\u2212\u2206\u03a6 \u2297 I]v) + 2\u03bd(v, \u03a6\u2032\u2032 v),\n(0)\n\nwhere \u2212\u2206\u03a6 = d\u2217\u03a6 d\u03a6 is the self-adjoint Laplacian on 0-forms.\n8\n\n(4.7)\n\n\fUsing the convexity of \u03a6, we then obtain (i) with c0 = 2c\u03bd > 0 uniformly in N .

Since L is non self-adjoint, it is no longer true that the resolvent at z is bounded above by the\ninverse of the distance of z to the spectrum. This is because of the non-commutativity of the self-adjoint\nand anti self-adjoint components and hence the necessity of the type of arguments in (4.8).\n5. Exponential approach to equilibrium\nProof of the Theorem. We only need to verify the conditions in Lemmas 1 and 2, namely convexity of\nthe Hamiltonian in H0 . The rest will follow by applying these two lemmas and contour integration.\nRecall that the H s and the Hamiltonian H-balls are as defined in (2.9, 2.10) and we restrict to functions\nu such that its Fourier coefficients an = 0 for |n| > N . So the sums below are to be understood as:\nX\nX\nX\n;\n=\n:=\nn\u2208Zd\n\n|n|\u2264N\n\nin other words, the B below is fixed independent of N . Therefore the radius of the various \"balls\" are\nfixed. It is only the dimension of the balls that varies with N .\nRemark. For most of the applications, u = \u03c0\u0169, where \u03c0 is the projection onto the first \"N \" Fourier\nmodes while \u0169 has full Fourier support and is in at least one of the \"balls\".\nDefine the Hamiltonian H-ball as before:\nX\n2\u03bb\n|\u03a6(a)/(2\u03c0)d | =|\n(n2 + 1)|an |2 +\np j\n\nX\n\n1 \u2212j2 ...+jp\u22121 \u2212jp =0\n\n< B.\n\naj1 \u0101j2 ...ajp\u22121 \u0101jp |\n\n(5.1)\n\nUsing the results of sect. 3, we have that if a is in the above H-ball, then for the defocusing case, \u03bb > 0,\n\u03a6 is convex and (v, \u03a6\u2032\u2032 v) < C. So H is a convex set with the well-defined boundary\n\u2202H = {a| \u03a6(a)/(2\u03c0)d = B},\n9\n\n\fand\n\nX\n\nfor a in H.\n\n(n2 + 1)|an |2 < B\n\nFor the focusing case, \u03bb < 0, assume we look at the connected component containing the origin,\nnamely H0 \u220b 0. Let A be the set\nX\nA = {a|\n(n2 + 1)|an |2 < 5B},\n(5.2)\n\nand\n\nHA := H0 \u2229 A.\n\nThe Proposition then gives that \u03a6 is convex in A and moreover \u03a6(*) is equivalent to the H 1 norm:\ns\n1\n\u03a6(f )\np\n(5.3)\n< (1 + C|\u03bb|B p )kf kH1 < 2kf kH1 ,\nkf kH1 < (1 \u2212 C|\u03bb|B )kf kH1 <\n2\n(2\u03c0)d\nfor |\u03bb| \u226a 1 and where f is the function with Fourier coefficients a \u2208 A.\n\nEquation (5.3) together with (5.2) give that H0 is strictly contained in A:\nHA \u2261 H0 .\n\nSo H0 is a convex set with the well-defined boundary\n\u2202H0 = {a| \u03a6(a)/(2\u03c0)d = B} \u2282 A.\nWe now evaluate the semi-group e\u2212tL using the contour \u0393 = \u03931 + \u03932 , where \u03931 is compact enclosing\n0 and Re \u03931 \u2264 c\u2032 < c0 , the c0 in Lemma 2; and \u03932 is defined by\n2\n\n{z| |Im z| = |Re z|2 + D, if Re z > c\u2032 and |Im z| \u2264 c\u2032 + D if Re z = c\u2032 for some D > 0},\nso that\n\nI\n1\ne\u2212tz (z \u2212 L)\u22121 dz\n2\u03c0i \u0393\nI\nI\n1\n1\n=\ne\u2212tz (z \u2212 L)\u22121 dz +\ne\u2212tz (z \u2212 L)\u22121 dz.\n2\u03c0i \u03931\n2\u03c0i \u03932\n\ne\u2212tL =\n\nIt follows from Lemmas 1 and 2 that the above contours lie in the resolvent set and the integrals are\nwell-defined. (i, ii) of Lemma 2 proceed to give that the first term is \u03a00 and (iii) gives the exponential\nestimate for the second term, uniformly in N and concludes the proof.\n\u0003\nProof\nof Corollary. This follows from global convexity of \u03a6, which is moreover uniform in the radius\n\u221a\nB of the H-ball, since H 1 ball is equivalent to H-ball in the defocusing case. Since\nX \u2202\u03a6\ndbn ,\nd\u03a6 =\n\u2202bn\nn\nwhere bn = an and \u0101n , let u be the function with Fourier coefficients {an }, we have that\nX \u2202\u03a6\n2\n|2 \u2264 4\u03c0 2d (kukH 2 + |\u03bb|kukp\u22121\n0<\n|\nL2p\u22122 )\n\u2202an\n2\n< 4\u03c0 2d (kukH 2 + |\u03bb|Cd,p kukp\u22121\nH 2 ) < \u221e,\n\nwhere we used convexity for the lower bound, (3.10) and the restrictions on d and p. So the energy\nsurfaces \u2202H is well-defined if u \u2208 H 1 \u2229 H 2 . Using the density of H 2 in H 1 , we reach the conclusion of\nthe Corollary.\n\u0003\n10\n\n\f6. The limit N \u2192 \u221e\nAs discussed in the introduction, the existence of a Gibbs measure \u03bc \u223c exp[\u2212\u03b2H] for the H in (2.1)\nis a problem which has been studied extensively. It corresponds in d = 1 to the problem of the behavior\nof the limit N \u2192 \u221e of the measure \u03bcN \u223c exp[\u2212\u03b2\u03a6N ]. These measures exist for all p in the defocusing\ncase and for p \u2264 6 for the focusing case under some restrictions. In d \u2265 2, even the defocusing case\nrequires Wick ordering, see (1.3), and it does not exist for the focusing case.\nIn d = 2, the Hamiltonian dynamics corresponding to \u03bd = 0, have been modified by Bourgain to\ninclude Wick ordering and shown, as mentioned earlier, to be well defined for the defocusing case when\np = 4. Whether one can make a similar modification to the Langevin dynamics, \u03bd > 0, is an open and\nintriguing question. We note however that the Wick ordered nonlinear term : up : is not convex. So\nthe argument in this paper leading to the existence of a spectral gap would not hold for the modified\ndynamics. Of course the result might still be true. But this is another question.\nThe question of what happens to the dynamics generated by (2.2) or the Fokker - Planck equation\n(2.4) in the limit N \u2192 \u221e is therefore of relevance here primarily in the case d = 1. We consider the\ndefocusing and the focusing cases below.\nThe defocusing SNLS\n\n\u221a\nIn this case the estimates in the Corollary are not only uniform in N , but also in the radius B of\nthe Hamiltonian ball, which is equivalent to the H 1 norm. For d = 1, letting B \u2192 \u221e and subsequently\nN \u2192 \u221e, should therefore lead to the limiting measure with density:\nZ\n\u03b2\u03bb\n|u(x)|p dx],\n\u03bc = Z \u22121 exp [\u2212\np T\nwith respect to the free field Gaussian measure. A full proof is under investigation.\nThe 1d focusing SNLS\nIn the 1d focusing case, the limiting measures when p = 4 and for small |\u03bb| also p = 6 are known\nto exist [LRS] and are invariant [Bo1] under the corresponding dispersive NLS dynamics, i.e., (1.3)\nwhen \u03bd = 0. When \u03bd > 0, the Theorem indicates a spectral gap uniform in N , albeit restricted to a\nHamiltonian ball in which it is convex.\nFor fixed N , this restriction to a Hamiltonian ball can be replaced by a restriction to an L2 ball with\nNeumann boundary conditions, as mentioned after the Theorem in sect. 2, since the Hamiltonian vector\nfield is also tangential to the L2 sphere. We then have that for both p = 4 and 6, the Hamiltonian is\nconvex (uniformly in N ) for small |\u03bb| depending on the radius of the L2 ball using Sobolev embedding\nand interpolation. In the focusing case, the Hessian of the Hamiltonian is bounded above by a constant\n(which only depends on N ). So using the same arguments as in sects. 4 and 5, the Fokker-Planck\noperator has a spectral gap uniform in N .\nThis L2 Neumann restriction is a priori compatible with the ensuing N \u2192 \u221e limit as the Brownian\n\u2212\nmotion in d = 1 is supported in H 1/2 \u2282 L2 and should lead to the limiting measure constructed in\n[LRS]. The question would then concern its invariance with respect to the SNLS dynamics in (1.3).\nThe general procedure could be akin to that in [Bo1] on the corresponding Hamiltonian dynamics.\nAlternatively one could try to consider the limit N \u2192 \u221e of the equation (2.4). See [H] for some results\nin a related but finite N setting.\n7. Appendix: The Witten-Hodge complex\nBelow we make a short introduction to the Witten-Hodge complex (originally introduced in [Wi])\nusing the self-adjoint setting. This is because the structure remains the same and the notations are a\nbit simpler, cf. Chap. 11, in particular Chap. 11.4 in [CFKS].\n11\n\n\fToward that purpose, let \u03c6 \u2208 C \u221e (RN ; R). Let d be the usual exterior differentiation:\nd=\n\nN\nX\n\n\u2202xj dx\u2227\nj\n\nj=1\n\nand\nd\u03c6 = e\u2212\u03c6 de\u03c6 = d + d\u03c6\u2227 =\n\nX\n\nzj dx\u2227\nj,\n\n(7.1)\n\nj\u2208\u039b\n\nwhere\nzj =\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c6\n+\n.\n\u2202xj\n\u2202xj\n\n(7.2)\n\n(For the calculus of differential forms, see for example [Sp].)\nIf f is a form of degree m, then d\u03c6 f is a form of degree m + 1. For example, if f is a 0-form, i.e., a\nscalar function in C \u221e (RN ; R), then\nN\nX\n(zj f )dxj\nd\u03c6 f =\nj=1\n\nis a 1-form, which we may identify with a vector valued function F with the components:\nFj (x) = (zj f )(x),\nN\ni.e., a function in C \u221e (RN ; RP\n). (We note that when \u03c6 = 0, d\u03c6 f = df , which is just the usual differential\nof f .) If f is a 1-form, f = j fj dxj then\n\nd\u03c6 f =\n\nX\ni<j\n\n(zi fj )dxi \u2227 dxj\n\nis a 2-form, which we may identify with an N \u00d7 N antisymmetric matrix function M with the entries:\nMij (x) = \u2212Mji (x) = (zi fj )(x),\ni.e., a function in C \u221e (RN ; RN \u2227 RN ). The operator zj can be seen as an annihilation operator in view\nof its action on e\u2212\u03c6 , namely\nzj e\u2212\u03c6 = 0, for j = 1, 2, ..., N.\nOn the space of m-forms, one may define an L2 scalar product for two m-forms \u03c9 and v: (\u03c9, v).\nSpecializing to v = d\u03c6 f , where f is an (m \u2212 1)- form, we define the adjoint operator d\u2217\u03c6 of d\u03c6 so that:\n(\u03c9, d\u03c6 f ) = (d\u2217\u03c6 \u03c9, f ).\nThis gives the formal adjoint to be\nd\u2217\u03c6 = e\u03c6 d\u2217 e\u2212\u03c6 =\n\nN\nX\n\n\u230b\n\nzj\u2217 dxj ,\n\n(7.3)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere\nzj\u2217 = \u2212\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c6\n+\n\u2202xj\n\u2202xj\n\nand \u230b is the usual contraction which lowers the degree of the forms.\n12\n\n(7.4)\n\n\fIf f is a form of degree m, then d\u2217\u03c6 f is a form of degree m \u2212 1. For example, if\nf=\n\nN\nX\n\nfj dxj\n\nj=1\n\nis a 1-form, then\nd\u2217\u03c6 f =\n\nN\nX\n\nzj\u2217 fj\n\nj=1\n\n\u221e\n\nN\n\nis a 0-form, i.e., a scalar function in C (R ; R). (We note that when \u03c6 = 0, d\u2217\u03c6 f = d\u2217 f is just the\nusual divergence of f .) If f is a 0-form, then d\u2217\u03c6 f = 0.\nThe operator zj\u2217 can be viewed as a creation operator. For example, when N = 1 and \u03c6 = x2 ,\nz := zj\u2217 generates the first Hermite polynomial. We have the commutation relation:\n\u2217\n\n[zj , zk\u2217 ] = 2\u2202j \u2202k \u03c6,\n\n(7.5)\n\nwhich plays an important role. We check easily that indeed\nd\u03c6 d\u03c6 = d\u2217\u03c6 d\u2217\u03c6 = 0.\n\n(7.6)\n\nUsing d\u03c6 , d\u2217\u03c6 , we define the Witten Laplacian,\n\u2212\u2206\u03c6 = d\u2217\u03c6 d\u03c6 + d\u03c6 d\u2217\u03c6 ,\n\n(7.7)\n\non C \u221e (RN ; \u2227l RN ) (1 \u2264 l \u2264 N ), where \u2227l RN denotes the lth anti-symmetric tensor product of RN with\n\u2227RN := RN , \u22272 RN := RN \u2227 RN etc. For example, if l = 2, then an element of C \u221e (RN ; RN \u2227 RN ) is an\nN \u00d7 N anti-symmetric matrix valued function mentioned earlier and when l = N , it is the determinant.\nNotice that\nd\u03c6 \u2206\u03c6 = \u2206\u03c6 d\u03c6 , d\u2217\u03c6 \u2206\u03c6 = \u2206\u03c6 d\u2217\u03c6\n\n(7.8)\n\n(l)\n\nby using (7.6). If we let \u2206\u03c6 be the restriction of \u2206\u03c6 to forms of degree l, we obtain more precisely:\n(l)\n\n(l+1)\n\nd\u03c6 \u2206\u03c6 = \u2206\u03c6\n\n(l+1)\n\nd\u03c6 , d\u2217\u03c6 \u2206\u03c6\n\n(l)\n\n= \u2206\u03c6 d\u2217\u03c6 .\n\n(7.9)\n\nWe remark that the above construction is similar to that of Hodge Laplacian which corresponds\nto taking \u03c6 = 0. (For a quick overview of the analytical aspects of Hodge theory, see Chap 11.3 in\n[CFKS]. ) We have explicitly\n(0)\n\n\u2212\u2206\u03c6 = d\u2217\u03c6 d\u03c6 =\n\nN\nX\nj=1\n\nzj\u2217 zj = \u2212\n\nN\nX\n\u22022\n2\n2 + kd\u03c6k \u2212 Tr Hess \u03c6.\n\u2202x\nj\nj=1\n(0)\n\n(7.10)\n\nFor example, if \u03c6 is a non-degenerate quadratic form, then \u2212\u2206\u03c6 is an N -dimensional harmonic oscillator. zj and zj\u2217 are just the annihilation and creation operators for the harmonic oscillator. More\ngenerally, we have\nXX\nXX\n\u230b\n\u230b\n\u2212\u2206\u03c6 =\nzj zk\u2217 dx\u2227\nzk\u2217 zj dxk dx\u2227\nj dxk +\nj\nXX\n\u230b\n\u230b\n\u230b\n\u2217\n\u2227\n\u2227\n\u2217\n=\nzk zj (dxj dxk + dxk dxj ) + [zj , zk ]dx\u2227\nj dxk\n(7.11)\nX\nXX\n\u230b\n=\nzj\u2217 zj + 2\n(\u2202xj \u2202xk \u03c6)dx\u2227\nj dxk\nXX\n(0)\n\u230b\n= \u2212\u2206\u03c6 \u2297 I + 2\n(\u2202xj \u2202xk \u03c6)dx\u2227\nj dxk ,\n13\n\n\fwhere to obtain the third line from the second, we used (7.5). In particular, with the identification of\n1-forms with RN valued functions, we obtain\n(1)\n\n(0)\n\n\u2212\u2206\u03c6 = \u2212\u2206\u03c6 \u2297 I + 2\u03c6\u2032\u2032 .\n\n(7.12)\n\n(l)\n\n(l)\n\nSince formally (\u2212\u2206\u03c6 u, u) \u2265 0, under appropriate conditions on \u03c6 at infinity, we can define \u2212\u2206\u03c6\n(l)\n\n(l)\n\nas a self-adjoint operator and that \u2212\u2206\u03c6 has compact resolvent, cf. [S1]. Moreover \u2212\u2206\u03c6 has discrete\n(0)\n\nspectrum contained in [0, \u221e). The lowest eigenvalue of \u2212\u2206\u03c6 is zero and a corresponding eigenfuction is\ne\u2212\u03c6 , since this function is annihilated by d\u03c6 . This eigenvalue is simple, for if u is another eigenfunction\n(0)\nassociated to the same eigenvalue, then 0 = (\u2212\u2206\u03c6 u, u) = kd\u03c6 uk2 and hence d\u03c6 u = 0, which means\n\u2212\u03c6\nprecisely that u is a multiple of e .\nUsing (7.8), we obtain the following intertwining property of the spectra:\n(0)\n\n(1)\n\n\u03c3(\u2212\u2206\u03c6 )\\{0} \u2282 \u03c3(\u2212\u2206\u03c6 ).\n\n(7.13)\n\n(0)\n\nThis is because if f is an eigenfunction of \u2212\u2206\u03c6 :\n(0)\n\n\u2212\u2206\u03c6 f = \u03baf\n\n(7.14)\n\nwith \u03ba > 0, then operating on (7.14) with d\u03c6 , we obtain\n(0)\n\n(1)\n\n\u2212d\u03c6 \u2206\u03c6 f = \u2212(d\u03c6 d\u2217\u03c6 )d\u03c6 f = \u2212\u2206\u03c6 (d\u03c6 f ) = \u03bad\u03c6 f.\n(1)\n\nSo if \u03ba 6= 0, then d\u03c6 f 6= 0 is an eigenform for \u2212\u2206\u03c6 , which is the statement in (7.13).\n(1)\n\n(0)\n\nThis is in fact the main reason that we introduced \u2212\u2206\u03c6 . Using (7.12), we then obtain that \u03c3(\u2212\u2206\u03c6 )\nhas a spectral gap if \u03c6 is strictly convex. We end this self-adjoint introduction by remarking that if e\u2212\u03c6\nis the eigenfunction of the Schr\u00f6dinger operator\n\u2212\n\nX \u22022\n+V\n\u2202x2j\n\nfor the lowest eigenvalue \u03ba, then\n\u2212\n\nX \u22022\n(0)\n+ V \u2212 \u03ba = \u2212\u2206\u03c6 .\n\u2202x2j\n\nFrom this point of view, the Witten-Hodge Laplacian can be seen as a natural generalization of harmonic\noscillators when \u03c6 is quadratic.\nReferences\n[Bi]\n\nJ.-M.
