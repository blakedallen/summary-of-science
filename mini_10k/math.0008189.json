JOHNSON AND J\u00c1NOS KOLL\u00c1R\n\nA Fano variety is a projective variety whose anticanonical class is\nample. A 2\u2013dimensional Fano variety is called a Del Pezzo surface.\nIn higher dimensions, attention originally centered on smooth Fano\n3\u2013folds, but singular Fano varieties are also of considerable interest\nin connection with the minimal model program. The existence of\nK\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein metrics on Fano varieties has also been explored, see\n[Bourguignon97] for a summary of the main results. Here again the\nsmooth case is of primary interest, but Fano varieties with quotient\nsingularities and their orbifold metrics have also been studied.\nIn any given dimension there are only finitely many families of smooth\nFano varieties [Campana91, Nadel91, KoMiMo92], but very little is\nknown about them in dimensions 4 and up. By allowing singularities,\ninfinitely many families appear and their distribution is very poorly\nunderstood.\nA natural experimental testing ground is given by hypersurfaces and\ncomplete intersections in weighted projective spaces. These can be\nwritten down rather explicitly, but they still provide many more examples than ordinary projective spaces. Experimental lists of certain\n3\u2013dimensional complete intersections were compiled by [Fletcher89]. In\nconnection with K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein metrics, the 2\u2013dimensional cases were\nfirst investigated in [Demailly-Koll\u00e1r99] and later in [Johnson-Koll\u00e1r00].\nIt is also of interest to study Calabi\u2013Yau hypersurfaces and hypersurfaces of general type in weighted projective spaces. [Fletcher89]\ncontains some lists with terminal singularities.\nThe aim of this paper is threefold.\nFirst, we determine the complete list of anticanonically embedded\nquasi smooth Fano hypersurfaces in weighted projective 4-spaces. There\nare 48 infinite series and 4442 sporadic examples (7). As a consequence we obtain that the Reid\u2013Fletcher list (cf. [Fletcher89, II.6.6])\nof 95 types of anticanonically embedded quasi smooth terminal Fano\nthreefolds in weighted projective 4-spaces is complete (11).\nSecond, we prove that many of these Fano hypersurfaces admit a\nK\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein metric (15). We also study the nonexistence of tigers\non these Fano 3\u2013folds (in the colorful terminology of [Keel-McKernan99]).\n1\n\n\f2\n\nJENNIFER M. JOHNSON AND J\u00c1NOS KOLL\u00c1R\n\nThird, we prove that there are only finitely many families of quasi\nsmooth Calabi\u2013Yau hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces of any\ngiven dimension (16). This implies finiteness for various families of\ngeneral type hypersurfaces (18).\nDefinition 1. For positive integers ai let P(a0 , . . . , an ) denote the weighted\nprojective n-space with weights a0 , . . . , an . (See [Dolgachev82] or [Fletcher89]\nfor the basic definitions and results on weighted projective spaces.) We\nalways assume that any n of the ai are relatively prime. We frequently\nwrite P to denote a weighted projective n-space if the weights are irrelevant or clear from the context. We use x0 , . . . , xn to denote the\ncorresponding weighted projective coordinates. Pi \u2208 P(a0 , . . . , an ) denotes the point (xj = 0 \u2200j 6= i). These are sometimes called the\nvertices of the weighted projective space. (The vertices are uniquely\ndetermined if none of the ai divides another.) The affine chart where\nxi 6= 0 can be written as\nCn (y0 , . . . , y\u02c6i , . . . , yn )/Zai (a0 , . . . , \u00e2i , . . . , an ).\n\n(1.1)\n\n(Here and later \u02c6 denotes an omitted coordinate.) This shorthand\ndenotes the quotient of Cn by the action\n(y0 , . . . , \u0177i , . . . , yn ) 7\u2192 (\u01eba0 y0 , . . . , \u0177i , . . . , \u01eban yn ),\nwhere \u01eb is a primitive ai th root of unity. The identification is given by\na\nyjai = xaj i /xi j . (1.1) are called the orbifold charts on P(a0 , . . . , an ).\nFor any i, P(a0 , . . . , an ) has an index ai quotient singularity at Pi .\nFor any i < j, if gcd(a0 , . . . , \u00e2i , . . . , a\u02c6j , . . . , an ) > 1, then P(a0 , . . . , an )\nhas a quotient singularity along (xi = xj = 0). These give all the\ncodimension 2 singular subsets of P(a0 , . . . , an ).\nFor every m \u2208 Z there is a rank 1 sheaf OP (m) which is locally free\nonly if ai |m for every i. A basis of the space of sections of OP (m) is\ngiven by all monomials in x0 , . . . , xn with weighted degree m. Thus\nOP (m) may have no sections for some m > 0.\n2 (Anticanonically embedded quasi smooth Fano hypersurfaces).\nLet X \u2208 |OP (m)| be a hypersurface of degree m. The adjunction\nformula\nKX \u223c\n= OP (KP + X)|X \u223c\n= OP (m \u2212 (a0 + * * * + an ))|X\nholds if X does not contain any of the codimension 2 singular subsets.\nIf this condition is satisfied then X is a Fano variety iff m < a0 +* * *+an .\nFrequently the most interesting cases are when m is as large as possible.\nThus we consider the case Xd \u2208 |OP (d)| for d = a0 + * * * + an \u2212 1. Such\nan X is called anticanonically embedded.\n\n\fFANO HYPERSURFACES IN WEIGHTED PROJECTIVE 4-SPACES\n\n3\n\nIn most cases, all hypersurfaces of a given degree d are singular and\npass through some of the vertices Pi . In these cases the best one can\nhope is that a general hypersurface Xd is smooth in the orbifold sense,\ncalled quasi smooth. At the vertex Pi this means that the preimage of\nXd in the orbifold chart Cn (y0 , . . . , \u0177i , . . . , yn ) is smooth. In terms of\nthe monomials of degree d this is equivalent to saying that\ni\nFor every i there is a j and a monomial xm\ni xj of degree d.\n\n(2.1)\n\nj = i is allowed, corresponding to the case when the general Xd does\nnot pass through Pi . The condition that Xd does not contain any of\nthe singular codimension 2 subsets is equivalent to\nIf gcd(a0 , . . . , \u00e2i , . . . , a\u02c6j , . . . , an ) > 1 then there is a\nmonomial of degree d not involving xi , xj .\n\n(2.2)\n\nFor n \u2265 3, these are the two most important special cases of the general\nquasi smoothness condition:\nFor every I \u2282 {0, . . . , n} there is an injection\ne : IQ\n\u0592\u2192 {0, . . . , n} and monomials\nm\nxe(i) j\u2208I xj ij of degree d for every i \u2208 I.\n\n(2.3)\n\nRemark 3. The quasi-smoothness condition in [Fletcher89, I.5.1] says\nthat\nFor every I \u2282 {0, . . . , n} either (2.3) holds,\nQ\n(2.3\u2032 )\nb\nor there is a monomial j\u2208I xjj of degree d.\nThe two versions are, however, equivalent. We prove this by induction\nQ\nb\non |I|. Indeed, assume that there is a monomial j\u2208I xjj of degree\nd and let I \u2032 \u2282 I be all the indices which are involved in at least one\nsuch monomial. By induction (2.3) holds for I \\ I \u2032 , giving monomials\nQ\nb\nxe(i) j\u2208I\\I \u2032 xjij for i \u2208 I \\ I \u2032 . By assumption these e(i) are not in I,\nso we can choose I \u2032 \u222a e(I \\ I \u2032 ) as the image of e : I \u2192 {0, . . . , n}. (A\nsuitable reordering of the values of e may be necessary.)\nThe computer searches done in connection with [Fletcher89] and\n[Demailly-Koll\u00e1r99] looked at values of ai in a certain range to find\nthe ai satisfying the constraints (2.1-3). This approach starts with the\nai and views (2.1-3) as linear equations in the unknown nonnegative\nintegers mi , mij .\nIn the cases studied in [Fletcher89] and [Demailly-Koll\u00e1r99] these\nsearches seemed exhaustive. Aside from one series of examples, the\ncomputers produced solutions for low values of the ai and then did not\nfind any more as the range of the allowable values was extended. This\nof course does not ever lead to a proof that the lists were complete.\n\n\f4\n\nJENNIFER M. JOHNSON AND J\u00c1NOS KOLL\u00c1R\n\nA similar search for log Fano hypersurfaces in weighted projective\n4\u2013spaces seems much harder. With some reasonably large bounds, say\nai \u2264 100, the programs run very slowly and they produce examples\nwhere the ai are near 100. It is quite unlikely that any systematic\nsearch of this kind could have discovered the example with the largest\na0 :\n(407, 547, 5311, 12528, 18792) with monomials\n7\n91\nx24 , x33 , x59\n1 x2 , x0 x2 , x0 x1 ,\n\nor the beautiful pair of sporadic examples with largest a4 :\n(223, 9101, 46837, 112320, 168480) with monomials\n1301\nx24 , x33 , x1 x72 , x0 x37\nx2 ,\n1 , x0\n\nand\n\n(253, 7807, 48101, 112320, 168480) with monomials\n7\n1301\nx24 , x33 , x37\nx1 .\n1 x2 , x0 x2 , x0\n\nThe biggest values of a0 are of some interest in connection with the\nconjectures of [Shokurov97, 1.3].\nNext we describe the computer programs that led to the list of anticanonically embedded quasi smooth Fano hypersurfaces in weighted\nprojective 4-spaces. The programs, written in C, are available at\nwww.math.princeton.edu/~jmjohnso\n4 (Preliminary steps).\nIn order to find all solutions, we change the point of view. We consider (2.1) to be the main constraint with coefficients mi and unknowns\nai . The corresponding equations can then be written as a linear system\n(M + J + U)(a0 a1 a2 a3 a4 )t = ( \u22121 \u2212 1 \u2212 1 \u2212 1 \u2212 1)t\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere M = diag(m0 , m1 , m2 , m3 , m4 ) is a diagonal matrix, J is a matrix\nwith all entries \u22121 and U is a matrix where each row has 4 entries = 0\nand one entry = 1. The main advantage is that some of the mi can be\nbounded a priori. Assume for simplicity that a0 \u2264 a1 \u2264 * * * \u2264 a4 .\nConsider for instance m4 . The relevant equation is\nm4 a4 + ae(4) = a0 + a1 + a2 + a3 + a4 \u2212 1.\nSince a4 is the biggest, we get right away that 1 \u2264 m3 \u2264 3. Arguing\ninductively with some case analysis we obtain that\n3 \u2264 m2 \u2264 16, 2 \u2264 m3 \u2264 6, 1 \u2264 m4 \u2264 3\n\n(4.2)\n\n\fFANO HYPERSURFACES IN WEIGHTED PROJECTIVE 4-SPACES\n\n5\n\nThus we have only finitely many possibilities for the matrix U and\nthe numbers m2 , m3 , m4 . Fixing these values, we obtain a linear system\n(M + J + U)(a0 a1 a2 a3 a4 )t = ( \u22121 \u2212 1 \u2212 1 \u2212 1 \u2212 1)t ,\nwhere the only variable coefficients are m0 , m1 in the upper left corner\nof M. Solving these formally we obtain that\na0 =\n\n\u03b10 m1 + \u03b20\n\u03b11 m0 + \u03b21\n, a1 =\n.\n\u03b32 m0 m1 + \u03b30 m0 + \u03b31 m1 + \u03b4\n\u03b32 m0 m1 + \u03b30 m0 + \u03b31 m1 + \u03b4\n\nwhere the \u03b1i , \u03b2i , \u03b3i , \u03b4 depend only on U and m2 , m3 , m4 .\nWe distinguish 3 cases. The first one is the main source of examples.\nCases 2 and 3 are anomalies from the point of view of our method.\nIn both cases we ended up experimentally finding strong restrictions\non the ai . Even with hindsight we do not know how to prove these a\npriori.\nCase 1 (\u03b32 6= 0). In this case the absolute value of\n\u03b10 m1 + \u03b20\n\u03b32 m0 m1 + \u03b30 m0 + \u03b31 m1 + \u03b4\ngoes to zero as m0 , m1 go to infinity. It is not hard to write down the\nprecise condition and a computer check shows that\n\u03b10 m1 + \u03b20\n\u22651\n\u03b32 m0 m1 + \u03b30 m0 + \u03b31 m1 + \u03b4\n\n\u21d2\n\nmin{m0 , m1 } \u2264 83.\n\nCase 2 (\u03b32 = 0, \u03b30 \u03b31 6= 0 ). It turns out that if this holds then \u03b30 \u03b31 > 0\nand a0 , a1 are bounded by 8 for min{m0 , m1 } \u2265 36. Moreover, the 3\nlinear forms\n\u03b10 m1 + \u03b20 , \u03b11 m0 + \u03b21 , \u03b30 m0 + \u03b31 m1 + \u03b4\nare dependent. This implies that\n\u03b11 \u03b31 a0 + \u03b10 \u03b30 a1 = \u03b10 \u03b11 .\nA computer search shows that this is possible only if a0 = a1 = 1.\nCase 3 (\u03b32 = 0, \u03b30 \u03b31 = 0). It turns out that one of \u03b10 m1 +\u03b20 , \u03b11 m0 +\u03b21\nequals \u03b30 m0 + \u03b31 m1 + \u03b4. Thus a0 = 1 or a1 = 1. Moreover, we also see\nby explicit computation that one of the following holds:\na2 = a3 = a4 ,\n\na2 = a3 = a4 /2 or a2 = a3 /2 = a4 /3.\n\n\f6\n\nJENNIFER M. JOHNSON AND J\u00c1NOS KOLL\u00c1R\n\n5 (Main Computer Search).\nHere we discuss the main case when, in addition to the inequalities\n(4.2) we also assume that 3 \u2264 m1 \u2264 83. In this case the system (4.1)\nreduces to a single unknown m0 . This is very similar to the 4\u2013variable\ncase discussed in [Johnson-Koll\u00e1r00].\nWe solve formally for a0 to get\n\u03b30\na0 =\nm0 \u03b1 + \u03b2\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b30 depend only on U and m1 , m2 , m3 , m4 . If \u03b1 6= 0 then we\nget a bound on m0 too, and we are down to finitely many possibilities\nall together. There are 403455 cases of this. The resulting solutions\nneed considerable cleaning up. Many of them occur multiply and we\nalso have to check the other conditions (2.2-3). Discarding repetitions,\nwe get 15757 cases, out of which 4594 are quasi smooth.\nIf \u03b1 = 0 then we get a series solution where the ai are linear functions of a variable m0 . There are 550122 cases of this. Here the main\ndifficulty is that the program does not produce the series in a neat\nform. Usually one series is put together out of many pieces according\nto some congruence condition.\n6 (Additional Cases).\nAssume first that we are in Case 2 of (4). Since a0 = a1 = 1, the\nnumbers a1 , a2 , a3 , a4 and d = a1 + a2 + a3 + a4 satisfy the numerical\nconditions (2.3). This leads to a lower dimensional problem which is\neasy to solve.\nCase 2 of (4) is even easier. We get solutions of the form\n(1, a, b, b, b),\n\n(1, a, b, b, 2b) or (1, a, b, 2b, 3b).\n\nApplying (2.3) to I = {2, 3, 4} gives that b|a. Thus b divides all but\none of the weights, so b = 1. This implies that a \u2264 6. At any case, all\nthese appear also under Case 2 of (4).\nAt the end we obtain our first main result:\nTheorem 7. The following is a complete list of anticanonically embedded quasi smooth Fano hypersurfaces in weighted projective 4-spaces:\n1. 48 infinite series of the form\nX2k(b1 +b2 +b3 ) \u2282 P(2, kb1 , kb2 , kb3 , k(b1 +b2 +b3 )\u22121)\n\nfor k = 1, 3, 5, . . .\n\nThe occurring 3-tuples b1 , b2 , b3 are described in (9).\n2. 4442 sporadic examples whose list is available at\nwww.math.princeton.edu/~jmjohnso\n\n\fFANO HYPERSURFACES IN WEIGHTED PROJECTIVE 4-SPACES\n\n7\n\n8 (An error check).\nWe wrote a program that looked at all 5-tuples satisfying\na0 \u2264 100, a1 \u2264 200, a2 \u2264 200, a3 \u2264 400, a4 \u2264 600.\nThe program ran for 4 days and produced 3610 quasi smooth examples.\nThese were in complete agreement with the correspondingly truncated\nlist of 4442 sporadic examples.\nRemark 9. It turns out that a 3-tuple b1 , b2 , b3 appears in (7.1) iff\n| \u2212 2K| of P(b1 , b2 , b3 ) has a quasi smooth member. The list of these is\nimplicit in Reid's list of 95 families of singular K3 surfaces in weighted\nprojective 3-spaces. In [Fletcher89, II.3.3] they correspond to those\nquadruplets (b1 , b2 , b3 , b4 ) for which b4 = b1 + b2 + b3 . Our 48 3-tuples\noccured explicitly in [Yonemura90, Tomari00] in connection with the\nstudy of simple K3 singularities of multiplicity 2.\nOne direction of this observation is easy to establish in all dimensions.\nLemma 10. Assume that | \u2212 2K| of P(b1 , . . . , bn ) has a quasi smooth\nmember. Then the general anticanonically embedded Fano hypersurface\nin\nP(2, kb1 , . . . , kbn , k(b1 + * * * + bn ) \u2212 1)\nis quasi smooth for k = 1, 3, 5, . . .\nWe conjecture that conversely, every infinite series is of this form. It\nis interesting that every quasi smooth hypersurface in P(2, kb1 , . . . , kbn , k(b1 +\n* * * + bn ) \u2212 1) has a codimension 2 singular set. Thus the above conjecture would imply that for every n \u2265 4 there are only finitely many\nanticanonically embedded quasi smooth Fano hypersurfaces with isolated singularities in weighted projective n-spaces.\nIt is not hard to check which of the above Fano threefolds have\nterminal singularities. The families in (7.1) always have nonisolated\nsingularities, and for the remaining cases the conditions of [Fletcher89,\nII.4.1] work. As a consequence, we obtain the following:\nCorollary 11. The Reid\u2013Fletcher list (cf. [Fletcher89, II.6.6]) of 95\nfamilies of anticanonically embedded quasi smooth terminal Fano threefolds in weighted projective 4-spaces is complete.\nNext we study the existence of K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein metrics and the\nnonexistence of tigers on our Fano hypersurfaces. After some definitions we recall the criterion established in [Johnson-Koll\u00e1r00]. In the\ncase of K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein metrics this in turn relies on earlier work of\n[Nadel90, Demailly-Koll\u00e1r99].\n\n\f8\n\nJENNIFER M. JOHNSON AND J\u00c1NOS KOLL\u00c1R\n\nDefinition 12. Let X be a normal variety and D a Q-divisor on X.\nAssume for simplicity that KX and D are both Q-Cartier. Let g :\nY \u2192 X be any proper birational\nmorphism, Y smooth. Then there is\nP\na unique Q-divisor DY = ei Ei on Y such that\nKY + DY \u2261 g \u2217 (KX + D) and g\u2217 DY = D.\nWe say that (X, D) is klt (resp. log canonical) if ei > \u22121 (resp. ei \u2265 \u22121)\nfor every g and for every i. See, for instance, [Koll\u00e1r-Mori98, 2.3] for a\ndetailed introduction.\nDefinition 13. [Keel-McKernan99] Let X be a normal variety. A tiger\non X is an effective Q-divisor D such that D \u2261 \u2212KX and (X, D) is not\nklt. As illustrated in [Keel-McKernan99], the tigers carry important\ninformation about birational transformations of log del Pezzo surfaces.\nThey are expected to play a similar role in higher dimensions.\nProposition 14. [Johnson-Koll\u00e1r00] Let Xd \u2282 P(a0 , . . . , an ) be a quasi\nsmooth hypersurface of degree d = a0 + * * * + an \u2212 1.\n1. X does not have a tiger if d \u2264 a0 a1 .\nn\n2. X admits a K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein metric if d < n\u22121\na0 a1 .\nCorollary 15. Of the sporadic series of quasi smooth Fano hypersurfaces given in (7.2), there are 1605 types where none of the members\nhave a tiger and 1936 types where every member admits a K\u00e4hler\u2013\nEinstein metric. This information is contained in the list given in\n(7.2).\nFinally we study the case of Calabi\u2013Yau hypersurfaces and hypersurfaces of general type in weighted projective spaces. For these cases\nthere are finiteness results in all dimensions. The key part is the case\nof Calabi\u2013Yau hypersurfaces.\nTheorem 16. For any n there are only finitely many types of quasi\nsmooth hypersurfaces with trivial canonical class in weighted projective\nspaces P(a0 , . . . , an ).\nProof. As in the Fano case, first we look at those hypersurfaces\nwhich are quasi smooth at the vertices of P(a0 , . . . , an ). This condition\nis equivalent to a linear system of equations\n(M + J + U)(a0 , . . . , an )t = (0, . . . , 0)t\n\n(16.1)\n\nwhere M = diag(m0 , . . . , mn ) is a diagonal matrix, J is a matrix with\nall entries \u22121 and U is a matrix where each row has n entries = 0\nand one entry = 1. In the geometric setting the mi and the ai are\n\n\fFANO HYPERSURFACES IN WEIGHTED PROJECTIVE 4-SPACES\n\n9\n\npositive integers, but it will be convenient to allow the ai to be positive\nreal\nP numbers. By the homogenity of the system we may assume that\nai = 1.\nAssume now that we have an infinite sequence of solutions (a0 (t), . . . , an (t))\nwhere a priori M(t), J(t), U(t) also vary with t. By passing to a subsequence we may assume that J(t), U(t) are constant and each ai (t)\nconverges to a value\nP Ai . Thus wePcan write ai (t) = Ai + ci (t) where\nlimt\u2192\u221e ci (t) = 0, i Ai = 1 and i ci (t) = 0. By passing to a subsequence and rearranging, we can also assume that I := {i : ci (t) < 0} is\nindependent of t and that A0 /(\u2212c0 (t)) is the smallest positive number\namong {Ai /(\u2212ci (t)) : i \u2208 I}. The quasi smoothness condition at the\nvertex P0 translates into m0 (t)a0 (t) + aj (t) = 1. limt\u2192\u221e a0 (t) = A0 > 0\nsince c0 (t) < 0, hence m0 (t) is bounded from above. Thus we may\nassume that m0 (t) = m0 is constant and limt\u2192\u221e m0 c0 (t) + cj (t) = 0.\nm0 a0 (t) + aj (t) = 1 is equivalent to\n[m0 A0 + Aj ] + [m0 c0 (t) + cj (t)] = 1.\n\n(16.2)\n\nBy the above considerations, (16.2) splits into 2 equations\nm0 A0 + Aj = 1 and m0 c0 (t) + cj (t) = 0.\nUsing\n\nP\n\n(16.3)\n\ni ci (t)\n\n= 0 and the second equation in (16.3) we obtain that\nX\nX\nci (t) \u2264 \u2212cj (t) = m0 c0 (t).\n(16.4)\nci (t) = \u2212\ni\u2208I\n\ni6\u2208I\n\nMultiplying by A0 /c0 (t) and using the special choice of A0 /c0 (t) we get\nthat\nX\nX\nA0\nm0 A0 \u2264\nci (t)\n\u2264\nAi .\n(16.5)\nc0 (t)\ni\u2208I\ni\u2208I\nCombining with the first equation of (16.3) we get that\nn\nX\nX\n1 = m0 A0 + Aj \u2264 Aj +\nAi \u2264\nAi = 1.\ni\u2208I\n\n(16.6)\n\ni=0\n\nThis implies that all inequalities in (16.4\u20136) are equalities. Hence\nAk , ck (t) are zero for k 6\u2208 I \u222a {j}. By assumption the ak (t) are positive,\nso I \u222a {j} = {0, . . . , n}. Moreover, the ratios Ai /ci (t) are all the same\nfor i \u2208 I.\nThese imply that, up to rearranging the indices, the ai (t) are of the\nform\nPn\u22121\n(A0 (1 \u2212 c(t)), . . . , An\u22121 (1 \u2212 c(t)), An + c(t) i=0\nAi ).\nConsider next the equation\nmn (An + c(t)\n\nPn\u22121\ni=0\n\nAi ) + Aj (1 \u2212 c(t)) = 1,\n\n\f10\n\nJENNIFER M. JOHNSON AND J\u00c1NOS KOLL\u00c1R\n\nwhere for notational simplicity\nPn\u22121 we allow j = \u22121 with A\u22121 = 0. For\nlarge t this implies that i=0 Ai = Aj , which is not possible for n \u2265 2.\nThus An = 0 and the solutions become\nPn\u22121\n(A0 (1 \u2212 c(t)), . . . , An\u22121 (1 \u2212 c(t)), c(t)) where\ni=0 Ai = 1. (16.7)\nTo get\nPquasi smoothness, we need to understand all monomials\nP of degree ai , which amounts to finding all integer solutions of bi ai = 1.\nIn our case, for large t there are no solutions\nwith bn = 0 which\nP\nmeans that every hypersurface of degree\nai contains the hyperplane\n(xn = 0), hence they are all reducible. Thus the solutions (16.7) do\nnot correspond to quasi smooth hypersurfaces.\nRemark 17. The solutions (16.7) do correspond to interesting series\nPn\u22121 1\n= 1 they\nof singularities. Namely, for every integer solution of i=0\nmi\ngive an infinite series of singularities\nm\n\nn\u22121\nk\nn+1\n0\n(xm\n0 + * * * + xn\u22121 + xn )xn = 0 \u2282 A\n\nfor k = 1, 2, . . . .\n\nThese singularities are weighted homogeneous and semi log canonical\n(see [Koll\u00e1r et al.92, 16.2.1] for the definition) but not isolated. By\nadding a general higher degree term, we get isolated log canonical singularities.\nCorollary 18. For any n and k > 0 there are only finitely many\nfamilies of quasi smooth hypersurfaces X \u2282 P(a0 , . . . , an ) such that\n\u03c9X \u223c\n= OX (k).\nProof. Assume that\nX = (F (x0 , . . . , xn ) = 0) \u2282 P(a0 , . . . , an )\nis quasi smooth of degree d and \u03c9X \u223c\n= OX (k). Then\nk\u2212times\n\nz }| {\nX \u2217 := (F (x0 , . . . , xn ) + xdn+1 + * * * + xdn+k = 0) \u2282 P(a0 , . . . , an , 1, . . . , 1)\nis also quasi smooth of degree d and \u03c9X \u223c\n= OX . Thus we are done by\n(16).\nRemark 19. The finiteness result (18) is in accordance with the conjectures [Koll\u00e1r et al.92, 18.16]. On the other hand, (16) seems to be\na more special finiteness assertion.\nAcknowledgments . We thank J. McKernan for helpful comments\nand references.
