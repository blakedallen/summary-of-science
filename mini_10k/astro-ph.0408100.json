This was a straightforward conclusion when a search for the fueling mechanism using highestresolution optical observations of a sample of Seyfert nuclei\nwith the Hubble Space Telescope returned nuclear spirals in\n6 out of 12 galaxies. Nuclear spirals turned out to be much\nmore frequent in Seyfert galaxies than gas inflow related to\nnuclear bars, the commonly proposed feeding mechanism.\nObservations of a larger sample that followed (Martini &\nPogge 1999) found nuclear spirals in 20 out of 24 Seyfert 2\ngalaxies, and in a later sample of 46 Seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies\n(Pogge & Martini 2002) almost all were classified as having nuclear spirals. The authors of these latter surveys also\nshowed that nuclear spirals are not self-gravitating, and that\nthey are likely to be shocks in nuclear gas discs. The most\nrecent study (Martini et al. 2003a,b) involves a sample of\n64 Seyfert galaxies, as well as a control sample, which together are big enough so that trends can be noticed. In particular, the authors of this study point out that all granddesign nuclear spirals occur in barred galaxies, but not all\nbarred galaxies develop nuclear spirals - some of them have\nnuclear rings. Tightly-wound nuclear spirals tend to avoid\nbarred galaxies instead.\nWhy do some barred galaxies develop nuclear spirals,\nwhile other develop nuclear rings? Why do tightly wound\nnuclear spirals prefer galaxies that do not have a bar? Can\nc 0000 RAS\n\nany type of nuclear spirals generate inflow sufficient to feed\nlocal Seyfert nuclei? Seyfert galaxies require mass accretion\nrates of \u223c 0.01 M\u2299 /yr (e.g. Peterson 1997). Here I attempt\nto answer these questions under an assumption that nuclear spirals are density waves generated in gas by a rotating\npotential, as described in the accompanying Paper I (Maciejewski 2004). Implications of the linear theory (originally\nproposed by Goldreich & Tremaine 1979) derived in Paper I\nwill serve here as a guideline, but by themselves they cannot\nprovide answers to the questions above, since the amplitude\nof strong bars very much exceeds the linear theory.\nIn the linear approximation the arm/interarm density\nratio is a scalable value, as long as the perturbation is small.\nTo estimate how big this ratio is for a given asymmetry in\nthe potential, one can search for nonlinear solutions (e.g.\nYuan & Cheng 1989, 1991) or directly involve hydrodynamical modeling. The second approach has the advantage that\na whole range of non-axisymmetries, from small ones to ones\nof the order of the axisymmetric component, can be studied\nwith the same tool. I take this approach, and I construct in\nthis paper hydrodynamical models of gas flow in the nuclear\nregions of weakly and strongly non-axisymmetric potentials.\nTo study structures in gaseous nuclear discs of galaxies with the help of hydrodynamical models exceptionally\nhigh resolution is required, which has been achieved only recently. Athanassoula's models of gas flow in barred galaxies\n(1992b) show curling of the inner parts of the straight principal shock, but the resolution of these models prevents us\nfrom following this feature further inwards.

The latter work interpreted these features in terms of spiral density waves, weak\nenough so that the linear theory is applicable. On the other\nhand, Maciejewski, Teuben, Sparke & Stone (2002, hereafter\nMTSS02) point out that nuclear spirals in their models take\nthe form of a shock, which is beyond the scope of the linear\ntreatment.\nIn this paper I construct hydrodynamical models of nuclear spirals for realistic gravitational potentials represented\nby rotation curves characterized in Paper I. In particular, I\nam interested in how the gas flow in the nucleus is modified\nby the presence of a central massive black hole (MBH) or a\ndensity cusp. As pointed out in Paper I, the central MBH\nsignificantly changes the nuclear gravitational potential, and\ntherefore it should be able to regulate gas flow around itself.\nHere, I investigate how its presence modifies gas inflow onto\nthe centre. In Section 2, I list the models to be analyzed in\nthis paper, and I describe the code with which they were\nbuilt. In order to link the models with the linear theory, in\nSection 3 I analyze models of gas flow in a weak oval, where\nthey should not depart significantly from the linear prediction. In Section 4, I apply the same analysis to gas flow\nin strong bars. Preliminary results about nuclear spirals in\ndouble bars are listed in Section 5.\n\n2\n\nTHE CODE AND SETUP OF THE MODELS\n\nThe models were calculated using the CMHOG hydrodynamical code (Piner et al. 1995, MTSS02), which solves the\nsingle-fluid equations in their Eulerian form on a fixed polar\ngrid. The gas is isothermal with the sound speed c = 20\nkm/s (hereafter termed hot gas), the value suitable for centres of galaxies (Englmaier & Gerhard 1997), but runs with\nc = 5 km/s (hereafter termed cold gas) have also been done\nfor comparison. The gas is not self-gravitating. All models\nare built on the grid covering half of the plane, and point\nsymmetry is assumed. The grid has 174 cells spaced logarithmically in the radial direction, and 80 cells covering a\n180\u25e6 angle.\nIn order to discuss the physical processes operating in\nrelation to nuclear spirals, I chose 10 hydrodynamical models\n\nkpc\nkpc\nkpc\nkpc\nkpc\nkpc\nkpc\nkpc\nkpc\nkpc\n\nshowing typical features for a given gravitational potential\nand gas characteristics. The models, with their parameters,\nare listed in Table 1. Models starting with '0' are built for\nthe potential characterized by rotation curve A from Paper\nI (linear inner rise), and models starting with '8' are for the\npotential characterized by rotation curve B (a 108 M\u2299 MBH\nadded in the centre). The potential in all models includes an\nn = 2 Ferrers bar. The bar is either identical to the primary\nbar in models of MTSS02 (termed 'strong bar' in Table 1,\nmodel names with 'S'), or its quadrupole moment is 10 times\nsmaller than in MTSS02 models, and the axial ratio of the\nbar is decreased to 1.5 from the original 2.5 for strong bar\n(hereafter I call it 'weak oval', model names with 'W'). The\npotential with a double bar is identical to that in MTSS02.\nIn the linear approach, the potentials of both the strong\nbar and the weak oval have the outer Inner Lindblad Resonance (ILR) at 2.3 kpc, and, in the absence of a central\nMBH (models starting with '0'), they also have an inner\nILR (iILR) at 0.13 kpc. Models with a central MBH (models starting with '8') have no iILR.\nFor each model, the initial gas density is constant\nthroughout the grid (10 M\u2299 pc\u22122 ), and the initial kinematics is gas motion on circular orbits with rotation velocity derived from the axisymmetrized potential, where the\nbar mass was incorporated into the bulge component. Then,\nthrough the first 0.1 Gyr of each run, the bar or oval is\nextracted continuously from the bulge, and its strength remains unchanged afterwards till the end of the simulation.\nThe method to introduce the secondary bar is discussed in\nSection 5 devoted to models of nested bars.\nPolar grid has singularity at r = 0, and models built on\nit cannot include the galactic centre, but they stop at a certain minimal radius: the inner grid boundary. The calculated\ngas flow in the innermost parts of the galaxy may depend on\nthe boundary conditions adopted there. Usually outflow conditions are imposed with no inflow onto the grid allowed (e.g.\nPiner et al. 1995, Englmaier & Shlosman 2000, MTSS02).\nHowever, this boundary condition effectively means creation\nof a sink for gas, which may generate unphysical inflow, and\nunclear rules for wave reflection or absorption. Therefore in\nthis paper I introduced also a reflection condition at the inner grid boundary. The benefit of this boundary condition\nis that the sink term is removed from the problem, because\nno gas leaves the grid. Consequently, more conservative estimates for gas inflow can be given (Section 3.4). With this\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fNuclear spirals. II. Hydrodynamical models\n.\n\n3\n\ncondition, waves in gas are fully reflected at the inner boundary. In Section 3.3 I show that the reflected wave is unlikely\nto play important role in gas dynamics.\n\n3\n\nGAS FLOW IN A WEAK OVAL\n\nModels 1\u20136 are built for the potential with a weak oval,\nwhose departure from axisymmetry is much smaller than\nthat for a strong bar studied by MTSS02. The QT parameter, defined as the maximum ratio of tangential to radial\nforce (Combes & Sanders 1981), is 0.21 for models with a\nstrong bar, but only 0.01 for models with a weak oval. In\na real galaxy, such asymmetry will most likely remain undetected, leading to unbarred classification even in the recent detailed infrared studies (e.g. Laurikainen, Salo & Buta\n2004).\n3.1\n\nGlobal morphology and kinematics of a\nnuclear spiral in hot gas\n\nA snapshot of gas density, representative for a nuclear spiral\ngenerated by a weak oval in hot gaseous disc is shown in\nFig.1. It was taken from Model 8W20, 0.4 Gyr into the run,\nonce the flow has stabilized. Model 0W20 shows the same\nmorphology, except for its innermost parts, because gravitational potentials in these two models are almost identical\nat radii above a few hundred parsecs. The nuclear spiral is\nclearly visible in the top panel of Fig.1, although the straight\nprincipal shocks disappeared completely once the bar was replaced by a weak oval. The density contrast between the arm\nand the inter-arm region is about 2 (Fig.1, middle panel),\ntherefore the spiral should be clearly visible in the color\nmaps. On the other hand, this contrast is small enough, so\nthat the perturbation of the velocity field is small. Therefore\nthere are no shocks forming in the gas, and gas flow in discs\nwith this type of the nuclear spiral is almost circular.\nUnlike nuclear spirals in strong bars, which unwind outwards rapidly in order to match the principal shock in the\nbar, nuclear spirals in weak ovals follow the linear mode\nlonger, and wind up to 3 times around the centre (6\u03c0 angle). After the flow gets stabilized, the bisymmetric nuclear\nspiral seen in Fig.1 remains unchanged in the frame rotating with the bar: it does not rotate, neither it winds up or\nunwinds around the centre. Between the inner grid boundary, and the outer ILR (oILR) it winds around the centre\nby about a 5\u03c0 angle.\n3.2\n\nThe m = 4 spiral outside the oILR\n\nIn the linear approximation, the nuclear spiral should not extend outwards beyond the outer ILR (Paper I, Section 3.1).\nIn fact, from the top panel of Fig.1 one can see that a clear\ndouble-arm spiral does not extend out beyond the oILR at\n2.3 kpc (dashed circle). However, there is spiral structure\ndetectable in gas morphology out to about 3.5 kpc. The\ndensity contrast is much weaker there, and a closer inspection indicates that a four-arm spiral is present outside the\ntwo-arm one. Linear theory (see Paper I, Section 3) predicts\nthat such a spiral can be generated by an m = 4 mode in\nthe potential, and that it should extend from the galactic\ncentre out to the radius where \u03a9 \u2212 \u03ba/4 = \u03a9B .

For our potential it is located at 3.9 kpc\n(dotted circle in the top panel of Fig.1), which is consistent\nwith the observed extent of the four-arm spiral. Ferrers' bar\ncan be decomposed into even-m components, among them\nm = 4, and this component is responsible for a four-arm\nspiral outside the proper nuclear spiral. Note that two arms\nof this four-arm spiral are just continuations of the two-arm\nnuclear spiral from smaller galactic radii, albeit with much\nlower density contrast. In addition, two other arms start at\nthe oILR, at position angles \u223c 90\u25e6 and \u223c 270\u25e6 , and extend\noutwards. The transition from a two-arm spiral inside the\noILR to a four-arm one outside it is illustrated in the bottom\npanel of Fig.1, which shows the density profiles as a function\nof angle along the rim of two circles: one of radius 1.5 kpc,\nwhich is located inside the oILR, and the other one of radius 3 kpc, placed between the oILR and the 4:1 resonance.\nAlong the first circle, there is only one clear density maximum per \u03c0 angle, which indicates a two-arm spiral. The\ndensity ratio is about 1.8. Along the second circle, two weak\nbut still clear density maxima are seen in a \u03c0 angle. This\nis characteristic for a four-arm spiral. The density ratio between maxima and minima along this circle ranges between\n1.1 and 1.2, depending on which maximum/minimum values are taken. Thus one may expect weak four-arm spiral\nstructures outside grand-design two-arm nuclear spirals.\nThe smooth transition from the nuclear spiral to the\nfour-arm spiral in the hydrodynamical models can be also\nseen in the radial changes of the pitch angle (Fig.2b, open\ncircles). It closely follows the linear prediction for a twoarm spiral inside the oILR (Fig.2b, solid line), but its value\nremains almost unchanged also at larger radii, where the\n\nnuclear spiral should unwind and disappear. There, spiral\narms of the nuclear spiral continue outwards, assuming outside the oILR pitch angle predicted by the linear theory for\na four-arm spiral (dotted line in Fig.2b). Thus continuation\nof the nuclear spiral to larger radii may hide the presence of\nthe oILR in the galaxy.\n3.3\n\nMorphology of the innermost regions\n\nThe linear theory says that if inside the oILR another ILR\nis present, the nuclear spiral should not propagate inwards\nof this ILR (the iILR). Here I follow the hydrodynamical\nrealization of this rule, using models of gas flow in gravitational potentials with the iILR (models 0W20), and without\nit (models 8W20). Note that the inclusion of a 108 M\u2299 MBH,\nwhich is the sole difference between the gravitational potentials in these models, is sufficient to remove the iILR in a\ngalaxy with a constant-density core.\nIn models 0W20 (rotation curve A), the nuclear spiral\nunwinds rapidly when it approaches the iILR from the outside, with its pitch angle well following the linear prediction\n(Fig.2b), and it disappears just outside the iILR. It remains\nstrong all the way until reaching the iILR, which may be the\nreason why the leading spiral predicted by linear theory to\nform at the iILR (Paper I) is absent. On the other hand, the\n8W20 models (rotation curve B) have only one ILR, and a\nclear nuclear spiral extends there all the way to the inner\nboundary (Fig.2c).\nIn the model 8W20r, the wave generating this nuclear\nspiral reflects from the inner boundary and interferes with\nthe incoming wave, which may perturb the solution. However, the original wave moving inwards is focused towards\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fNuclear spirals. II. Hydrodynamical models\n.\n\n5\n\n.\n\nFigure 3. Density distribution in the innermost parts of models\n8W20c (left), and 8W20o (right) at the end of the run at 0.9 Gyr.\nFigure 4. Mass accumulated within various radii (indicated in\nthe plot) as a function of time for model 8W20r.\n\nthe centre, while the reflected wave diverges away from the\ncentre, and it is quickly overcome by the incoming wave.\nThus the perturbation caused by reflection does not propagate beyond the innermost 10-20 cells, which on the standard grid corresponds to the range of radii 30 \u2013 45 pc. Moreover, this boundary condition has parallels to the actual\nphysical situation, when the wave propagating inwards encounters the accretion disc of the MBH with density likely\nhigher, which causes reflection, and any inflow in the spiral\naccumulates in the accretion disc.\nNevertheless the steady-state solution for model 8W20r\ndoes not reflect the winding of the spiral in the innermost\nregions predicted by the linear theory (compare the centralbottom panel of Fig.2 in Paper I to Fig.2c here). This is\nclearly seen as a discrepancy between the value of the pitch\nangle predicted by the linear theory, and measured in the\nmodel (Fig.2d, open circles) at radii below 200 pc. After the\nflow stabilizes, the maximal pitch angle (36\u25e6 ) is clearly larger\nthan the linear prediction (23\u25e6 ), and the maximum occurs\nat a smaller radius. However, when the model is examined\nbefore the flow settles down (here at 0.25 Gyr), the measured\npitch angle is much closer to the linear prediction (Fig.2d,\ntriangles).\nTo investigate whether this effect is numerical (vicinity of the inner grid boundary), I built two more versions of\nmodel 8W20: one with the outflow inner boundary condition\n(8W20o), and one still with the reflective inner boundary,\nbut extending four times further towards the galaxy centre,\ndown to the radius of 5 pc (8W20c). In this last version, a\nnuclear spiral winding up towards the centre develops during the early stages of the simulation. Its shape (Fig.2e) is\nsimilar to that in the central-bottom panel of Fig.2 in Paper\nI, and its pitch angle closely follows the linear theory (Fig.2f,\ntriangles). However, when the flow stabilizes, the innermost\npart of the nuclear spiral unwinds, with its pitch angle growing and reaching the same values as in model 8W20r (Fig.2f,\nopen circles). This result remains unchanged when outflow\nthrough the inner boundary is allowed (model 8W20o). In\nfact, once the flow stabilizes, the morphology of the nuclear\nspiral in all 3 versions of model 8W20 gets identical, and it\nremains so till the end of each run at 0.9 Gyr (Fig.3). Regardless of whether gas accumulates in the innermost cells\nof the grid in models with reflective inner boundary condition (8W20c, 8W20r) or whether it is removed from the grid\nwhen outflow is allowed (8W20o), the nuclear spiral reaches\nthe same steady state. Thus I conclude that the unwinding\nof the innermost part of the nuclear spiral is not an effect\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nof proximity of the inner grid boundary, but rather has hydrodynamical origin. However, it is unlikely to be an effect\nof wave reflection in the galaxy centre, since it also appears\nin the model version with the outflow boundary condition.\n\n3.4\n\nGas inflow triggered by a nuclear spiral in a\nweak oval\n\nThe rate of inflow can be deduced from how the mass contained within various radii changes with time. For model\n8W20r, Fig.4 shows gas mass within a number of radii as a\nfunction of time. Only mass enclosed in the innermost circle of the radius of 40 pc changes significantly. Throughout\nthe run it increases from 0.37\u00d7105 M\u2299 to 2.14\u00d7105 M\u2299 , but\nmost of the inflow occurs between 0.25 Gyr and 0.4 Gyr,\nwhen over 1.5\u00d7105 M\u2299 is dumped into radii below 40 pc.\nThus average inflow during this period of 150 Myr is about\n10\u22123 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . This inflow occurs exactly when the transition from a tightly wound spiral (Fig.2e) to the steady-state\nsolution (Fig.2c) occurs. Thus the formation of a nuclear\nspiral results in a single event of gas inflow into innermost\nparsecs of the galaxy, which dumps there about 105 M\u2299 of\ngas. After this single dump, the mass inflow is negligible,\nconsistent with zero. Such a one-time dump happens only\nin the models with the nuclear MBH (8W20). In models\nwithout it (0W20) the mass accumulated in the innermost\nregions does not change significantly with time.\nNuclear spirals may be generated not only by weak\novals, but also by transient phenomena like a passing globular cluster or a giant molecular cloud. Such nuclear spirals\nwould then also be transient and reoccurent. Model 8W20r\nindicates that every time the spiral reappears, it dumps\nsome 105 M\u2299 of gas onto the innermost parsecs of the galaxy,\nwhich may provide a way to sustain a weak nuclear activity.\nHowever, for such reoccurent dumping to take place, material has to be replenished into the inner 100pc, because\nformation of the spiral leads to mass increase within this\nradius of a few percent only, while 60% of gas within 100\npc radius ends up within 40 pc radius after formation of the\nspiral.\nNote that by imposing the reflection condition on the\ninner boundary of the polar grid used in these simulations\nI get the lower limit for the inflow. If free outflow through\nthe inner boundary is imposed instead, (model 8W20o, as\nin Piner et al. 1995), a flux of about 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 M\u2299 yr\u22121 is\n\n\f6\n\nWitold Maciejewski\n.\n\nis expectedly larger. There, the arm-interarm density ratio\napproaches 3. This amplitude gets damped quickly inwards,\nalthough the spiral can be traced down to the radius below\n1 kpc, where it winds almost by a 6\u03c0 angle.\nAs in the hot-gas case, a four-arm spiral is seen outside the oILR. According to the linear theory (Paper I), a\nleading nuclear spiral should develop in the vicinity of the\niILR in model 0W05o. In cold gas its propagation should\nnot be affected by the interference with the trailing spiral\noriginating at the oILR, as it happens in hot-gas models.\nInterestingly, such a leading spiral does not form \u2013 I discuss\nreasons for it in Section 6.3. Gas inflow in cold-gas models is negligibly small: in both 0W05 and 8W05 it never\nexceeds 10\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 even when outflow from the grid is allowed through the inner boundary.\n\n4\nFigure 5. Snapshot of gas density in model 8W05o, in the same\ngalactic potential as in model 8W20r presented in Fig.1, and at\nat the same evolutionary time. The only difference is the assumed\nsound speed in the isothermal gas, which is 5 km s\u22121 here (cold\ngas). Reference lines and the scale are the same as in the top\npanel of Fig.1.\n\ncrossing this boundary continuously after the flow stabilizes.\nAlthough this can be interpreted as an inflow, it is likely\ncaused by the assumption here that gas can leave, but not\nre-enter the grid, which creates a sink term in the problem.\nThe mass enclosed within larger radii does not change\nsignificantly under the action of the nuclear spiral. There\nis some inflow at radii between 0.5 and 1 kpc, since the\nmass enclosed within these radii increases during the 0.9Gyr run by 56% and 42% of its initial value, respectively.\nThe mass accumulated there increases gradually throughout\nthe run, which translates into an average inflow up to 0.01\nM\u2299 yr\u22121 . However, this mass does not get much further inwards than 500 pc from the galaxy centre, since the mass\naccumulated within the radius of 250 pc actually slightly\ndecreases throughout the run. Thus no mass transport from\nkpc- to pc-scale is expected by nuclear spirals of this kind.\n\n3.5\n\nNuclear spirals in cold gas\n\nThe linear theory predicts that the pitch angle i of the spiral\n(see eq.24 in Paper I) is proportional to the speed of sound\nin the isothermal gas in which the density wave propagates.\nThus the spiral in models 0W05 and 8W05, that involve\ncold gas with sound speed of 5 km s\u22121 , is much more tightly\nwound. Only model 8W05 is shown (Fig.5), since the other\none looks almost identical. From the linear theory, the pitch\nangle in cold-gas models is expected to be four times smaller\nthan in the hot-gas models. For a tightly-wound spiral, at\nany radius R, the radial distance dR between the adjacent\ndensity maxima is \u03c0R tan i. In cold-gas models considered\nhere it can be be as small as 0.13R. This corresponds to the\nradial separation of only 4 cells on our grid, which is insufficient to resolve the waves and results in numerical damping.\nSuch an effect is seen in Fig.5, where stronger spiral is only\npresent close to the oILR at 2.3 kpc, where its pitch angle\n\nNUCLEAR GAS FLOW GENERATED BY A\nSTRONG BAR\n\nThe perturbation in the stellar gravitational potential coming from a typical galactic bar is too strong to be described in\nlinear terms. Thus gas flows generated by such perturbation\ncannot be well described by the linear wave theory. One can\nget a better insight from the orbital theory of bars (Athanassoula 1992a, see also reviews by Sellwood & Wilkinson 1993\nand by Maciejewski 2003). Hydrodynamical models indicate\nthat in the main body of the bar, two symmetric shocks (the\nprincipal shocks) form on the leading sides of the bar. If the\nbar is strong and if it extends to its own corotation, these\nshocks are straight. Otherwise the shocks curl and start resembling a trailing spiral (Athanassoula 1992b). If there is\nan ILR in the galaxy, the principal shocks do not point at the\ngalactic centre, but they are offset from it. Gas and dust get\ncompressed in the principal shocks, which are seen as dust\nlanes in the optical images of barred galaxies (see e.g. NGC\n1097, NGC 1300, NGC 4303, and NGC 6951 in the Hubble\nAtlas of Galaxies, Sandage 1961). Inside the inner ends of\nthe dust lanes, there are nuclear rings (e.g. NGC 4314, Benedict et al. 2002) or nuclear spirals (e.g. NGC 1530, Regan,\nVogel & Teuben 1997, Pogge & Martini 2002).\nUntil recently, limited computing resources prevented\nus from studying these nuclear structures inside the principal dust lanes, because the resolution of the models was\nnot high enough. In the models by Athanassoula (1992b),\nthe straight principal shocks curl inwards in their innermost\nparts, but they cannot be followed to much smaller radii\nbecause of the limited resolution. Piner et al. (1995) employed polar grid in their hydrodynamical code (CMHOG,\nused also to build models presented in this paper). Resolution of this grid increases inwards, which allowed them\nto clearly resolve nuclear rings. They explained formation\nof these rings in terms of the orbital structure in the bars.\nThis explanation is summarized in Section 4.1 below, where\nI compare the mechanisms leading to the formation of nuclear rings and spirals. The CMHOG code allowed also to\nresolve for the first time nuclear spirals inside the straight\nprincipal shocks in the bar (Maciejewski 1998, 2000). Similar\nnuclear spirals were seen by Englmaier & Shlosman (2000)\nin their models with a different code, but also on the polar\ngrid. In this section I analyze in detail gas flow in the central\nregions of a strongly barred galaxy.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\f.\n\nNuclear spirals. II.

Right: Same for gas flow\nin model 0S05r (cold gas). Note how the shock propagating inwards in radius is damped by the density enhancement. Units on axes are\nin kpc.\n\n4.1\n\nHow to generate nuclear ring, and how\nnuclear spiral\n\nIt has been commonly accepted that the nuclear ring in\nbarred galaxies forms when the shocked gas leaves the x1\norbits and settles on the lower-energy x2 ones (Athanassoula\n1992a,b, Piner et al. 1995). The x2 orbits are almost round,\nand they do not intersect one another, making therefore a\nperfect location for gas to accumulate.\nHowever, strong bar, like any asymmetry in the nuclear\npotential, should also generate nuclear spirals inside its ILR.\nIn the orbital theory, the ILR is defined as the outer limit\nto which the x2 orbits can extend. Thus the nuclear spiral\nshould be cospatial with the nuclear ring. Yet some barred\ngalaxies show clear nuclear rings, while other display nuclear\nspirals without rings. Still some show nuclear spirals inside\nnuclear rings. What is the reason for this variety?\nFormation of the nuclear ring is explained by the orbital\ntheory, and the shapes of orbits that underlie this ring solely\ndepend on the properties of the gravitational potential. On\nthe other hand, the nuclear spiral has a wave-like nature,\nand its properties are determined by the dispersion relation\n(eq. 16 in Paper I). This relation depends not only on the\ngravitational potential, but also on the gas characteristics.\nIf gas is assumed to be isothermal, it depends on the sound\nspeed in gas.\nThus two mechanisms: orbital and wave-like, compete in\nshaping the dynamics of gas flow in central parts of galaxies.\nUsing two models of gas flow in a strongly barred galaxy, I\nexamine the outcome of this competition when the gas is\nhot (model 0S20r), and when it is cold (model 0S05r). Aside\nfor two different sound speeds in gas, all other parameters\nin these models are identical.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nOn the early stages of evolution, right after the bar has\nreached its full strength, the shocked gas tends to settle on\nthe x2 orbits marked in Fig.6 with dashed lines. At the same\ntime, the inner parts of the principal shock in the bar curl\ninwards, and tend to follow the linear dispersion relation\ninside the ILR. Thus in general, the shocked gas tends to\nfollow a path different from the direction in which the shock\npropagates, because the pitch angle of the the shock is different from the pitch angle of the orbit at a given location\n(Fig.6, inserts). Moreover, the linear formula for the pitch\nangle of the spiral wave (eq. 24 in Paper I) indicates that\nthis angle is larger for larger sound speeds.\nIn the hot gas (model 0S20r, Fig.6, left panel), the sound\nspeed is high, thus the pitch angle of the spiral is large. As\nshown in the insert, this pitch angle is always larger than\nthe pitch angle of the x2 orbits which the shock crosses. The\nshock propagates inwards crossing each x2 orbit only once,\nand then moving to smaller orbits. Thus the post-shock gas,\nwhich tends to settle on these orbits, always moves away\nfrom the shock front. In other words, the spiral shock propagates out of the post-shock gas condensation, into regions\nwhere the density of gas is much lower. This is clearly seen in\nthe left panel of Fig.6, after the shock crosses the second outermost x2 orbit. Propagation of shock from a high-density\nto low-density medium triggers a shoe-lace effect: the shock\ngets strengthened. In model 0S20r it gains strength high\nenough that it continues to propagate all the way to the\ngalactic centre. On the other hand, the post-shock gas tends\nto settle on the x2 orbits, as the gas condensation between\nthe two outermost x2 orbits indicates.\nIn the cold gas (model 0S05r, Fig.6, right panel), the\nsound speed is low, thus the pitch angle of the spiral is small.\nIt can become smaller than the pitch angle of the x2 or-\n\n\f8\n\nWitold Maciejewski\n\n.\n\nbits at their intersection with the shock (Fig.6, insert of the\nright panel). When it happens, the shock, still propagating\ninwards, crosses the x2 orbits from inside out. This means\nthat the dispersion relation forces the shock to propagate\nback into the post-shock gas, which tends to settle on these\nx2 orbits. In this gas condensation the shock gets damped.\nThis happens before the shock reaches the major axis of the\nbar in the right panel of Fig.6. Once the spiral shock weakens\nand disappears inwards, the gas settles on closed trajectories originating from the x2 orbits. However, they are not\nexactly the x2 orbits, since the shock constantly penetrates\nthe gas lane from inside, forcing the steady-state solution to\nbe rounder than the x2 orbits in the same area. This mechanism is confirmed by detailed hydrodynamical simulations\nof nuclear rings, where they appear almost circular, while\nthe underlying x2 orbits are significantly flattened (Piner et\nal. 1995, MTSS02).\nIn short, the nuclear spiral shock, being a continuation\nof the straight principal shock in the bar, can propagate\ntowards the galactic centre when it is able to escape the gas\ncondensation emerging from this principal shock. It can do\nit when the pitch angle of the spiral is large enough. If this\npitch angle is too small, the spiral shock gets damped in this\ngas condensation, and a nuclear ring forms.\n4.2\n\nProperties of the nuclear spiral\n\nI analyze properties of nuclear spirals in the central regions\nof a strongly barred galaxy using 2 hot-gas models: 0S20r\nand 8S20r. The early evolution of both models shows that\nas the time passes, the nuclear spiral starts at the inner ends\nof the principal shocks and propagates inwards (Fig.7, top\npanel). However, the density enhancement related to it is\nvery small (below 40%), and the spiral is only seen as large\ndiv 2 v, for negative divv, which indicates the shock. Thus\non the early stages of evolution, the principal shock in the\nbar gets extended inwards as a nuclear spiral shock. It has a\nnumber of properties that make it different from the density\nwave predicted by the linear theory:\n\u2022 the strength of the shock does not drop significantly\nwhen its shape converts from straight to spiral; to the contrary, as can be seen in the middle panel of Fig.7, the\nstrength of the spiral shock (measured by div 2 v) at the radius of 400 pc, where it winds by 5\u03c0/4 angle, is larger than\nthat of the principal straight shock (at 1.5 kpc at this position angle);\n\u2022 the nuclear spiral in model 0S20r, having the iILR, does\nnot stop at this resonance, but crosses it, and is propagating\ninwards, while in the linear theory the wave does not extend\nbeyond the resonance;\n\u2022 throughout the extent of the spiral shock, its pitch angle differs significantly from the linear prediction for both\nmodels 0S20r and 8S20r (bottom panel of Fig.7), although\nmodel 0S05r indicates that it still increases with the sound\nspeed in gas, as in the linear theory.\nIn both models 0S20r and 8S20r, at the simulation time\nabout 130 Myr, the spiral shock reaches the inner boundary\nof the polar grid located at the radius of 20 pc. All plots\nin Fig.7 show characteristics of the models at this moment.\nDue to the imposed reflective inner boundary condition, the\nwave making the nuclear spiral reflects at this boundary\n\nFigure 7.

However the\nreflected wave geometrically diverges, and it perturbs the\nincoming wave, which converges on the centre, only at the\ninnermost radii (see also Section 3.3). Note that the wave\nreflecting at the inner boundary may initially be weak, and\nnot a shock, since div 2 v along the spiral decreases in the innermost parts of the galaxy at these early stages of evolution\n(Fig.7, top panel). This is consistent with the nuclear spiral\nin model 8S20r following the linear prediction for the pitch\nangle at the innermost radii below \u223c 50 pc (Fig.7, bottom\npanel).\nAfter the reflection of the spiral wave from the inner\nboundary, its morphology quickly reaches a steady state, and\nit remains unchanged till the end of the runs at 0.5 Gyr. In\nmodel 0S20r, the spiral shock recedes from the centre after\nthe reflection, and in the steady state it is confined to the\noutside of the iILR. Characteristics of the flow in model\n8S20r at the time when its appearance has stabilized are\npresented in Fig.8. Several interesting features of the flow\ncan be observed:\n\u2022 as can be seen in the middle panel of Fig.8, the strength\nof the shock is roughly the same at 1.1 kpc, 0.3 kpc, and 0.05\nkpc - the first location is at the principal straight shock,\nwhile the two last locations are at the nuclear spiral shock;\ncomparing middle panels of Fig.8 and Fig.7 one can see that\nthe strength of the spiral shock at 0.3 \u2212 0.4 kpc has not\nchanged throughout the run (models 0S20r and 8S20r do\nnot differ much at radii that large);\n\u2022 variations in the profile of the tangential velocity (Fig.8,\nmiddle panel), which are much larger than in the model\n8W20r with a weak oval (Fig.1, middle panel), also indicate\nthat the departures from the circular rotation are nonlinear\nhere, and indicative of a shock;\n\u2022 the structure of the shock is best resolved in the cut\nthrough the spiral at 0.3 kpc (Fig.8, middle panel): regions\nof enhanced density (dotted line) occur directly outside of\nthe regions of large velocity convergence, which indicates the\nshock (dashed line), with the contact between the two zones\nat 0.33 kpc; for the trailing spiral it means that the density\nenhancement occurs downstream from the shock;\n\u2022 contrary to the early stages of evolution (Fig.7, top\npanel), when largest density concentration occurs around\nthe principal shock, at later stages (Fig.8, top panel) it is\nlocated in the nuclear spiral; middle panels of Figs. 7 and 8\n(drawn to scale) show that the peak density increased between the early and late stage by a factor of about 2 in the\nprincipal shock at 1.1 \u2212 1.9 kpc, but in the nuclear spiral at\n0.3 \u2212 0.4 kpc the rise is by a factor of more than 20;\n\u2022 the pitch angle of the nuclear spiral (Fig.8, bottom\npanel) still differs from the linear prediction (it is persistently larger), although it shows similar trends: the linear\nwave theory proposed by Englmaier & Shlosman (2000) to\nexplain the nuclear spirals in bars points out these trends,\nbut the flow is nonlinear and literal application of the linear\ntheory is not adequate here.\n\n4.3\n\nInflow in the spiral shock\n\nThe inflow in the spiral shock has been determined analogously to that in the weak nuclear spiral presented in section 3.4 (Fig.4).

Bottom: Mass inflow averaged over 20Myr intervals as a function of time in model 8S20r. The inflow is\nfollowed through circles of various radii indicated in the plot. Note\nthe small, but not negligible inflow triggered at the innermost\nradii in model 8S20r after the arrival of the spiral shock there (at\nabout 130 Myr).\n\nfore inflow through this circle should be small. In fact, the\nmass accumulated within this radius oscillates in both models 0S20r and 8S20r between 7.2 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 and 8.9 \u00d7 108 M\u2299\nthroughout the run.\nThe principal shock in the bar cuts through the circles\nof radii 2 kpc and 1 kpc (see Fig.8, top panel), and largest\ninflow is expected here. In fact, in the period between the\nstabilizing of the the morphology of the large-scale flow at\n200 Myr, and the end of the run at 500 Myr, about 2.2 \u00d7\n108 M\u2299 of gas crosses inwards through each circle, which\ncorresponds to the average inflow of 0.7 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (see also\nbottom panels of Fig.9). Thus by the end of the simulation,\nthe mass included in each of these circles increases several\ntimes compared to its initial value.\nThe circles of radius 500 pc and smaller are located in\nthe region of the nuclear spiral shock. The mass accumulated\nwithin radii of 500 and 250 pc evolves identically in models\n0S20r and 8S20r, therefore inflow at such radii most likely is\nnot influenced by the presence of a MBH in the galaxy centre. Nevertheless, this inflow is considerable. It is so because\nthe nuclear spiral hosts a shock, whose nature is dissipative.\nThis spiral shock, like the principal shock in the bar, takes\naway angular momentum from gas. However, the velocity\n\njump in the spiral shock is much smaller than that in the\nprincipal shock, and the extraction of angular momentum\nis less efficient. The timescale of inflow in the nuclear spiral\nis much longer than in the principal shock, and gas accumulates in the spiral, as is seen when comparing top panels\nof Figs. 7 and 8. This results in extreme over-densities in\nthe nuclear spiral (Fig.8, middle panel): over hundred times\nlarger than the initial density.\nNote that the mechanism extracting angular momentum from gas in the the nuclear spiral continues to work\nat the same efficiency per density unit. The increasing density means increasing inflow. Thus gas from the inflow in the\nprincipal shock gets collected on the nuclear spiral, and when\nits highest condensation moves inwards along this spiral towards a certain radius, the inflow at this radius increases. In\nthe models it can be seen on the example of the 500 and 250\npc radii. Top panel of Fig.8 indicates that the maximum\ndensity in the spiral has already passed the radius of 500\npc, and keeps propagating inwards along the spiral. This is\nconsistent with the inflow through this radius plotted in the\nbottom panels of Fig.9: it was constantly increasing between\n100 and 400 Myr, when the density peak in the spiral was\npropagating inwards to reach the radius of 500 pc. When it\nreached this radius, the amplitude of inflow stabilized. However, the inflow does not decay after that time, because the\nprincipal shock keeps the gas supply open. Note that at the\nend of the run, the inflow in the nuclear spiral at 500 pc is\nthe same as that in the principal shock at 1 kpc, which indicates that some kind of equilibrium has been established.\nOn the other hand, the density peak in the spiral does\nnot reach the radius of 250 pc within the simulation time\n(Fig.8, top panel), and inflow through this circle keeps increasing (Fig.9, middle panel). At the end of the run it\nreaches the value of 0.2M\u2299 yr\u22121 , 3.5 times smaller than that\nin the principal shock, and in the nuclear spiral at 500 pc.\nHowever, the evolution of the models suggests that when\nthe density peak reaches also this radius, the inflow will stabilize at the value equal to that at the larger radii, and it\nwill be the same for each smaller radius, so that eventually a\nsteady-state develops throughout the spiral, with the inflow\nin the spiral equal to that in the principal shock. However,\nit takes some 0.5 Gyr to establish such inflow at 500 pc, and\nlikely over 2 Gyr to establish it at 250 pc. Thus although\nin principle nuclear spirals can cause strong inflow of about\n1M\u2299 yr\u22121 at arbitrarily small radii, it is uncertain whether\nsuch spirals exist for periods long enough, so that the inflow\nhas time to reach these small radii.\nHowever, another mechanism of inflow in nuclear spirals\ngenerated by a strong bar takes place at the innermost radii.\nIn Section 3.4, I noticed a period of inflow in the weak spiral related to the change in its innermost morphology. It is\nbest seen in Fig.4 as a change of mass accumulated within\nthe radius of 40 pc. Similar increase within this radius is\nseen in model 8S20r after the spiral shock reaches the inner\ngrid boundary at about 130 Myr (Fig.9, top panel). Between\nthat time and 200 Myr, the mass within the radius of 40 pc\nincreases from 0.37 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 to about 6 \u00d7 105 . However,\ncontrary to the weak spiral in model 8W20r, inflow in the\nspiral shock never ceases (Fig.9, bottom panel), but it rather\nincreases with time, reaching the value of about 0.03 M\u2299 /yr\nat the end of the run. Similar rate of inflow is present at the\nradius of 100 pc, and both rates similarly evolve in time.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fNuclear spirals. II. Hydrodynamical models\n.\n\nThe inflow of \u223c 0.03 M\u2299 yr\u22121 takes place only in the\nmodel with the MBH in the centre (8S20r). The top panel\nof Fig.9 indicates that the evolution of mass accumulated\nin the inner 40 and 100 pc is significantly different in model\n0S20r without the MBH. In this model, after the spiral shock\nreaches the inner grid boundary, the mass enclosed within 40\npc increases initially by some 70%, but later it decreases, and\noscillates around lower values. A quasi-monotonical mass\nincrease occurs after 300 Myr, but it is likely related to the\nfirst mechanism of inflow described above, which propagates\ninwards from larger radii. In any case, the mass enclosed\nwithin radius of 40 pc at the end of the run in model 0S20r\nis 3.2 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 , which corresponds to the average inflow of\n0.0015 M\u2299 yr\u22121 in the period between 300 and 500 Myr. This\ninflow is 20 times smaller than in model 8S20r with a MBH.\n\n5\n\n11\n\n.\n\nFigure 10. Snapshots of gas density in model 0D20o of hot gas\nin the gravitational potential of a doubly barred galaxy identical\nto that used in MTSS02, taken at 145 Myr (left), and 200 Myr\n(right). The outer bar is vertical, position of the inner bar can\nbe deduced from oval density enhancements. Units on axes are in\nkpc.\n\nNUCLEAR SPIRALS IN DOUBLE BARS\n\nHydrodynamical models of gas flow in dynamically possible double bars (each bar supported by orbits calculated\nin this potential) were built by MTSS02. Already the orbital analysis (Maciejewski & Sparke 2000) indicated that\nstraight principal shocks cannot form in the inner bar in\nsuch systems, but gas should rather settle in rings elongated\nwith the inner bar. Hydrodynamical models of MTSS02 confirmed these predictions, and evolutionary stars+gas models\nof Rautiainen et al. (2002) showed that gas settles on orbits\ncalculated by Maciejewski & Sparke (2000). However, these\nmodels have been constructed for cold gas only.\nWhen the outer bar is identical to that in the models\nanalyzed in the previous section, it should by itself generate a nuclear spiral in the hot gas (see model 8S20r, Fig.8,\ntop panel). On the other hand, the orbital structure of the\ninner bar supports formation of gaseous rings, like the ring\nin model D05 in MTSS02, which is elongated with that bar.\nAgain, the ring and the spiral should occur at the same location since the inner bar is confined within the ILR of the\nouter one. Thus also in the case of double bar, there is a competition between the orbital structure and the propagating\nwave.\nIn order to see what comes out of this competition, I\nbuilt a model of gas flow in the potential of a doubly barred\ngalaxy identical to that in the models of MTSS02, but this\ntime for the hot gas. In this model, labeled 0D20o, the sound\nspeed in gas is 20 km s\u22121 , and both bars are being introduced\nsimultaneously in the first 100 Myr of the run.\nIn the linear approximation outlined in Paper I, the\nsolution is additive, and each independently rotating perturbation in the potential generates its own spiral mode in\ngas, which propagates with a specific dispersion relation.\nNote however that in the model considered here, the inner\nbar rotates with pattern speed 110 km s\u22121 kpc\u22121 , therefore\nit has no ILR (see the top-left panel of Fig.2 in Paper I).\nThus this inner bar does not generate a nuclear spiral on\nits own. Only the outer bar, which has a wide ILR, generates a nuclear spiral in the inner kiloparsec, as model 0S20r\nindicates.\nFig.10 shows two snapshots of gas density in model\n0D20o for hot gas in a doubly barred galaxy. Since the pitch\nangle of the spiral shock in such gas is high, the spiral shock\nusually propagates out of the density enhancement emergc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\ning from the straight principal shock. Therefore the nuclear\nspiral propagates inwards in this doubly barred galaxy despite the action of the inner bar. It reaches the inner grid\nboundary at about 145 Myr (Fig.10, left panel). Although\naccording to the linear theory the curvature of the spiral\ndoes not change with time at any point in the frame rotating with the outer bar, the curvature of the trajectories on\nwhich gas parcels move changes at a given point in this frame\nwith the rotation of the inner bar. The pitch angle of these\ntrajectories may become larger than the pitch angle of the\nspiral, causing discontinuities in the spiral shock propagating inwards. On later evolutionary stages, when the spiral\nshock traps considerable amounts of gas around itself, its\nshape is more influenced by the motion of the inner bar. At\ntimes, it may resemble straight principal shocks in the inner\nbar (Fig.10, right panel) although such shapes are transient.\nNote that this structure is still caused by the outer bar, even\nif it resembles the principal shock in the inner bar, to which\nit may be wrongly ascribed. Also with time a broad ring\nforms around the inner bar, but with moderate over-density.\nBecause of the complexity of this problem, detailed investigation of gas dynamics in nested bars requires further\nwork, but this brief analysis already returned some important information: nuclear spirals generated by the outer bar\nin doubly barred systems can propagate inside the inner bar.\nThus the presence of nuclear spirals in galaxies does not exclude a cospatial coexistence of inner bars in the same galaxies. Moreover, nuclear spirals can hide the presence of inner\nbars, as there is not much difference in the gas kinematics\nbetween the systems displayed in the left panel of Fig.10 and\nin the top panel of Fig.7.\n\n6\n6.1\n\nDISCUSSION\nMorphology of nuclear spirals\n\nThe number of galaxies with color- or structure maps of their\ncentral regions has recently become large enough, so that\nfirst attempts of morphological classification have been made\n(Malkan et al. 1998, Martini et al. 2003a,b). This second attempt seems to better reflect the characteristic structures\nobserved in galactic nuclei. There nuclear spirals are segregated into one of four classes: grand design, tightly wound,\n\n\f12\n\nWitold Maciejewski\n\nloosely wound and chaotic. Here I attempt to link this classification to the morphology observed in the models built in\nthis paper.\nHydrodynamical models of gas flow in rotating potentials presented here show that nuclear spirals are triggered\neven by small asymmetries in the potential. There they propagate as weak density waves, and they are not bracketed by\nstraight principal shocks, as it is the case in strong asymmetries induced by galactic bars. This should be expected,\nbecause the x1 orbits supporting a weak oval asymmetry\nare round, with no cusps, and thus do not induce shocks in\ngas. Since there are no straight shocks to join, the spirals\ncan continue winding around the centre, closely following\npredictions of the linear theory. Thus tightly-wound nuclear\nspirals, which can propagate freely in weak asymmetries of\nthe potentials, may be observationally associated with galaxies where the bar is too weak to be detected. However, if the\npotential or conditions in gas imply large pitch angle of the\nspiral wave in a given galaxy, then a loosely wound spiral\nwill appear in a galaxy classified as unbarred.\nOn the other hand, in strong bars nuclear spirals rapidly\nunwind outwards to match the shape of the straight principal shock in the bar. Thus regardless of the underlying potential or velocity dispersion in gas, nuclear spirals in strong\nbars are not likely to appear observationally as tightlywound spirals. This is consistent with the statistics of Martini et al. (2003 a,b): tightly wound spirals avoid barred\ngalaxies.\nGrand-design nuclear spirals require a strong driver\nwhich acts continuously over long time periods. In the statistics of Martini et al., they appear only in galaxies classified\nas barred. This implies that the galactic bar can serve as\nsuch a driver, and that there may be no other driver that\nfulfills the criterion above. Tightly or loosely wound spirals\nin the classification of Martini et al. can be generated by a\nweak oval, or when they show clear discontinuities, by a passing perturbation in the potential (globular cluster or giant\nmolecular cloud). With growing discontinuities, one moves\nto the class of chaotic spirals, whose generation mechanism\nis likely different (acoustic noise, see Elmegreen et al. 1998).\n6.2\n\nGas kinematics. Feeding of the AGN.\n\nRecent observational statistics of the central morphology in\na sample of active galaxies accompanied by a control sample (Martini et al. 2003 a,b) indicates that nuclear spirals\noccur with comparable frequency in active and non-active\ngalaxies. On the other hand, models presented in this paper\nshow that nuclear spirals generated by a strong bar take the\nform of shocks in gas and trigger moderate gas inflow onto\nthe central MBH, while nuclear spirals generated by a weak\noval do not cause the inflow. I propose that what determines\nthe inflow is not the driver, but the nature of the spiral. If\nit is a shock, then it is likely to trigger inflow. If it is not,\ninflow will not occur. Note that the morphology of the spiral shock departs from the linear prediction (Fig.8, bottom\npanel) in the sense that the pitch angle of the spiral is larger\nthan in the linear theory. Thus spiral shocks that do not appear as grand-design spirals, are likely to be observationally\nclassified as loosely wound spirals.\nIn the full sample of Martini et al. (2003a), grand-design\nand loosely wound spirals occur in 60% of active galaxies,\n\nand only in 23% of inactive ones. This difference is statistically significant, and it may indicate that although not\nall nuclear spirals are fueling the AGN, some spirals most\nlikely do it. However, morphological considerations are not\nsufficient to verify this hypothesis, and observations of gas\nkinematics in the spirals is needed. Clear departures from\ncircular motion are expected in spiral shocks (Fig.8), but\nnot in weak density waves that do not trigger inflow (Fig.1).\nIt became recently generally accepted that all galaxies may host a MBH at their centres (see e.g. Kormendy\n& Gebhardt 2001 for a recent review), and there are attempts to measure the mass of this MBH from the gas kinematics around it (e.g. Macchetto et al. 1997, Bower et al.\n1998, Maciejewski & Binney 2001). This method can be\nderailed by non-circular gas motions in the nuclear discs,\nespecially when they exhibit spiral structure. Spiral shocks\ncan strongly perturb the velocity field (Fig.8). However, if\ntightly wound nuclear spirals in fact correspond to models\nwhere the spiral is a weak density wave, then gas flow in\nsuch a spiral is almost circular (Fig.1), and methods based\non gas kinematics should yield a reliable MBH mass here.\n6.3\n\nLeading spirals, nuclear rings\n\nAccording to the linear theory outlined in Paper I, nuclear\nspirals generated at the OLR and at the oILR are trailing,\nand hydrodynamical models built in this paper well reproduce the trailing spirals related to the oILR. These spirals\npropagate inwards, as expected. However, the linear theory\nalso predicts formation of a leading spiral at the iILR that\npropagates outwards. Such combinations of a leading spiral\ninside a trailing one are very unusual in galaxies, with the\nonly familiar example being NGC 6902 (Grosb\u00f8l 2003). In\nthe models presented here leading spirals do not form, even\nwhen the iILR is present. One reason for it may be the extent of the trailing spiral generated at the oILR, which propagates inwards to the vicinity of the iILR in model 0W20,\nand even past it in model 0S20 of a spiral shock. This may\nsuppress formation of the leading spiral. However, in model\n0W05, where the trailing spiral gets damped not far inwards\nfrom the oILR, leading spiral does not form either. Some explanation here may come from the applications of the nonlinear theory of density waves developed by Yuan & Kuo\n(1997). It allows to investigate the effect of viscosity on the\nnuclear spirals. In the results presented by Yuan, Lin & Chen\n(2003) it can be seen that the leading spiral forms only for\nhigh viscosity. Viscosity in the hydrodynamical code used to\nbuild models in this paper is very low, and this may be the\nreason for the absence of the leading spiral. On the other\nhand, its absence in the observed nuclei of galaxies may indicate low effective viscosity in the ISM, much lower than\nwhat the quality of the code often imposes on the available\nhydrodynamical models.\nAnother feature promoted by numerical models and definitely under-abundant in the observed galaxies are nuclear\nrings. Only 2 nuclear rings are found in the sample of 43\nSeyfert galaxies observed by Pogge & Martini (2002), and an\neye-examination of the larger sample of 123 galaxies (Martini 2003a) picks up a dozen of nuclear rings. In Section 4.1\nI showed that nuclear rings form as an effect of interaction\nbetween the wave-nature of the principal shock in bar, and\nthe orbital structure there. This interaction creates condic 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fNuclear spirals. II. Hydrodynamical models\ntions favourable to the formation of nuclear rings when the\nvelocity dispersion in gas is low. In fact, low velocity dispersion in gas is assumed in models that form nuclear rings\n(e.g. Piner et al. 1995, Regan & Teuben 2003). However,\nvelocity dispersion in the inner discs of spiral galaxies is\nlikely to be higher (Englmaier & Gerhard 1997, Elmegreen\net al. 1998), which is consistent with the observed frequency\nof nuclear spirals that is higher than that of nuclear rings.\nThus studies of nuclear rings may only partially reflect gas\ndynamics in centres of galaxies. In particular, stagnation of\ngas inflow in the bar caused by these rings is not a general\nevidence against the possibility that bar-related inflow can\noccur at radii typical for rings. Nuclear rings make only one\ntype of nuclear gas flow, and another type, nuclear spirals,\nmay extend bar-related inflow to the innermost regions of\ngalaxies.\n\n7\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper I analyzed high-resolution hydrodynamical\nmodels of gas flow in nuclear spirals generated in the gaseous\ndisc by a rotating potential. Nuclear spirals form naturally\neven if the asymmetry in the potential is very small, with the\nmaximal ratio of radial to tangential force (the QT parameter, Combes & Sanders 1981) about 0.01. Thus asymmetries\nin galaxies often to weak to be detected observationally, like\na weak triaxiality of the bulge, may be sufficient to generate\nnuclear spirals. Models with weak asymmetry in the potential well conform to the linear prediction, while the nature of\nnuclear spirals in strong bars considerably differs from what\nis predicted by the linear density-wave theory.\nModels of galaxies with weak ovals indicate that nuclear spirals form even if the asymmetry in the potential is\ntoo weak to generate straight shocks along its major axis.\nIn such potentials, nuclear spirals are not forced to unwind\nrapidly outwards to match the straight shocks: they can follow predictions of the linear density-wave theory for longer,\nand wind more tightly than in the presence of a strong bar.\nThis is consistent with the recent statistical analysis by Martini et al. (2003a,b) which finds that tightly wound nuclear\nspirals rather avoid galaxies that are barred. The smooth\ncontinuation of the nuclear spiral into a four-arm spiral seen\nin the models with weak ovals indicates that the extent of\nsuch tightly-wound spirals may not be a good indicator of\nthe location of the ILR in galaxies without a clear bar. Nuclear spirals in weak ovals are not efficient in transporting\ngas from kiloparsec- to parsec- scale, but some inflow in\nthe innermost parsecs of the galaxy occurs during formation\nof such a spiral in models without an iILR (with a central\nMBH). Since these nuclear spirals can naturally re-appear\nas a response to the driver, gas dumped each time onto the\nMBH can maintain a weak nuclear activity.\nIn strong bar the nuclear spiral has the nature of a shock\nin gas. The spiral shock is less tightly wound than what the\nlinear theory predicts (compare Fig.1 to Fig.8). This may\nsuggest correspondence between spiral shocks and loosely\nwound spirals in the classification of Martini et al. (2003a).\nHydrodynamical models built in this paper show that such\nspiral shocks trigger gas inflow, although of different nature\nthan that in the straight principal shock in the bar. In the\nouter regions of the nuclear spiral, the inflow timescale is\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n13\n\nlonger than in the principal shock bracketing it from outside.\nTherefore gas initially accumulates there, but with time it\nis transported inwards along the spiral. The inflow rate at\ndensity peaks along the spiral equals that in the principal\nshock. Another inflow mechanism is present in the innermost\ntens of parsecs of the nuclear spiral in the presence of a\ncentral MBH: after the initial dumping of matter onto the\ncentre, common with the models for weak ovals, the mass\ninflow does not stop, but continues at a steady rate of up to\n0.03 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . Local Seyfert galaxies require mass accretion\nrates of \u223c 0.01 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (e.g. Peterson 1997), therefore the\ninflow rate in the models presented here is sufficient to feed\nluminous local Active Galactic Nuclei, and the feeding can\ncontinue over long timescales. An observational support for\nthis mechanism comes from the fact that when one groups\ntogether grand-design nuclear spirals (explicitly linked to the\nbars) and loosely wound spirals, they appear considerably\nmore often in active than in non-active galaxies (Martini et\nal. 2003a,b).\nNuclear spirals are more common in galaxies than nuclear rings. Which of these two will be triggered by a barred\npotential depends on the interplay between the post-shock\ngas condensations, which tend to follow the lowest-energy\norbits, and the shock, whose inner shape adheres to the\nrules for wave-propagation. In the ISM with low velocity\ndispersion, the shock is damped in gas condensation, and\na nuclear ring forms. When velocity dispersion in the ISM\nis high, the shock propagates away from gas condensation,\ngets strengthened, and continues inwards as a nuclear spiral.\nHigher frequency of nuclear spirals than of nuclear rings in\ngalaxies favours ISM with high velocity dispersion in centres\nof disc galaxies.\nSecondary inner bars in barred galaxies do not halt the\npropagation of nuclear spirals inwards. Thus nuclear spirals\ncan co-exist with inner bars in galaxies. Moreover, they can\nmask the presence of inner bars in galactic nuclei.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe CMHOG hydrodynamical code was written by James\nStone, and I am grateful to him for the right to use it.
