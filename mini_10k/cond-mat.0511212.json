It is shown that in one dimensional\narrays of resistively shunted Josephson junctions, the superconducting-normal charge relaxation\nwithin the grains plays an important role. At zero temperature, two superconducting phases can\nexist, depending primarily on the strength of the dissipation. In the fully superconducting phase\n(FSC), each grain acts superconducting, and the coupling to the dissipative conduction is important. In the SC\u22c6 phase, the dissipation is irrelevant at long wavelengths. The transition between\nthese two phases is driven by quantum phase slip dipoles, and is primarily local, with continuously\nvarying critical exponents. In contrast, the transition from the SC\u22c6 phase to the normal metallic\nphase is a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition with global character (i.e., determined by the field behavior\nat large wavelengths). Most interesting, is the transition from the FSC phase directly to the normal\nphase: this transition, which has mixed local and global characteristics, can be one of three distinct\ntypes. The corresponding segments of the phase boundary come together at bicritical points. These\nbehaviors are inferred from both weak and strong coupling renormalization group analyses. At intermediate temperatures, near either superconductor-to-normal phase transition, there are regimes\nof super-metallic behavior, in which the resistivity first decreases gradually with decreasing temperature before eventually increasing as temperature is lowered further. The results on chains of\nJosephson junctions are extended to continuous superconducting nanowires and the subtle issue of\nwhether these can exhibit an FSC phase is considered. Potential relevance to superconductor-metal\ntransitions in other systems is also discussed.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nA.\n\nMotivation\n\nQuantum mechanical systems that are coupled to dissipative \"environments\" arise in many areas of physics,\nincluding spin dynamics in nuclear magnetic resonance\n[1, 2], damping in atomic clocks and optical interferometers [3], dephasing and decoherence in mesoscopic systems [4] and quantum computing [5, 6]. Also in more\nconventional condensed matter contexts, dissipation has\nbeen argued to play crucial roles. In particular: near to\nquantum magnetic phase transitions; [7\u20139] in quantum\nHall systems; [10] and in various aspects of superconductivity, including Josephson junctions, and thin superconducting films and wires [11\u201324]. The last of these is the\nprimary focus of the present paper.\nFor theoretical studies of dissipative effects in macroscopic - and some mesoscopic - quantum systems, the\ndegrees of freedom that cause the dissipation are often\nmodeled as a heat bath following Caldeira and Leggett.\n[25\u201327] The best studied example is a single resistivelyshunted Josephson junction (RSJJ) [28\u201334]. Recent experiments by Pentill\u00e4 et al. [35, 36] have shown good\nagreement with the theoretical predictions. Extensions\nto arrays of RSJJs have been analyzed by several groups\nfocusing on the existence and location of phase boundaries between superconducting and insulating regimes of\n\nthe set of junctions. [11, 37\u201346] Experimental studies of\none and two dimensional arrays of large superconducting\ngrains coupled by dissipative Josephson junctions, agree\nqualitatively with results of the theoretical analyses [46\u2013\n57].\nThe understanding developed from studying the destruction of superconductivity by quantum fluctuations\nin arrays of Josephson junctions has became a useful\nparadigm for more general considerations of quantum\nphase transitions in dissipative environments. In general,\ndissipation suppresses certain types of quantum fluctuations and thus can favor states with spontaneously broken\nsymmetries, such as superconductivity. Considerable interest in further theoretical analysis of RSJJ arrays thus\nstems not only from direct experimental relevance in the\ncontext of superconductivity, but also from expectations\nthat the concepts and approaches will be useful far more\ngenerally, especially for understanding universal aspects\nof quantum phase transitions that can occur at zerotemperature in the presence of dissipation. But to do\nthis, it is crucial to take into account the small size of\nthe components involved, whether they are small grains\nor individual atoms in a crystal.\nBecause the models on which they are based were initially introduced to understand macroscopic quantum\nphenomena, [25\u201327] most theoretical analyses of RSJJ\narrays have assumed that the effective charges associated with the superconducting and normal currents\n\n\f2\nare perfectly mixed within the superconducting grains\nwhile passing separately between grains via the Josephson junctions and normal \"shunts\", respectively,. Such\nan approximation is reasonable for macroscopic superconductors but will break down in mesoscopic or microscopic systems [58]. As we showed in Ref. [58], a consequence of the breakdown of the macroscopic paradigm\nis that the superconducting and normal fluids can effectively decouple at low energies. For the simple case of\ntwo junctions in series through a mesoscopic grain, we\nshowed that this leads to changes in both the nature and\nlocation of the superconductor-normal transition that occurs. In the present paper, this analysis is extended to\nshow that decoupling of the two fluids has equally important consequences for chains of mesoscopic grains and for\nsuperconducting nanowires.\nThe goal of this paper is to provide a detailed analysis of superconductor-to-normal transitions in one dimensional mesoscopic systems for which dissipation plays\na role. The main emphasis is on chains of mesoscopic\ngrains that are connected both by Josephson junctions\nand some form of shunt resistance, although we also consider continuous superconducting nanowires. We will not\ndiscuss the possible origins of the assumed Ohmic dissipation in such systems, but rather assume that it is\npresent and study its consequences. Furthermore, because we are primarily interested in dissipative effects\nthat arise simply only if the diameters of the grains or\nwires are substantially larger than atomic sizes, we will\nalso ignore the limits in which the discreteness of the\nelectrons or Cooper pairs becomes most essential, such\nas in Giamarchi and Schulz's treatment of superfluid-tonormal transitions in Luttinger liquids, [59] and phenomena associated with localization by randomness. Within\na simple but relatively general mesoscopic model, we analyze the nature of the phases that can exist and the\nlocations and character of the several types of quantum\nphase transitions that occur. In particular, we study the\nuniversal scaling behavior of the resistivity in the vicinity of the superconductor-to-normal transition(s). To do\nso, we develop both strong- and weak-coupling renormalization group approaches which are tailored to deal with\nboth the local resistive and the long-wavelength superconducting degrees of freedom.\n\nscribes an infinite chain of mesoscopic two-fluid grains\nas shown in Fig. 1. Sec. II A discusses the various\npossible regimes and Sec. II B gives an analysis of the\nlinear electrodynamics of the model which provides intuition for the location and nature of the various transitions.\n\u2022 In Sec. III we discuss the strong coupling limit of\nthe chain, first deriving the quantum phase-slip representation of the chain (Sec. III A), from which we\nconstruct a sine-Gordon action (Sec. III B). Using\nthe sine-Gordon action for the chain, we discuss the\npossible phases of the system (Sec. III C). Finally,\nin Sec. III D we derive the strong coupling RG flow\nequations for the system. These are constructed by an\nanisotropic scaling procedure, suited to the dissipative\nenvironment.\n\u2022 In Sec. IV we use the RG flow equations to determine the phase diagram of the system. Although the\nsystem exhibits three phases, the transitions between\nthem have a variety of types. Each transition is discussed separately in Secs. IV A-IV F. Special aspects\nof the phase diagram, such as bicritical and multicritical points are discussed in Secs. IV G-IV I.\n\u2022 Sec. V analyzes the weak-Josephson coupling limit.\nFirst, we cast the action in terms of pair-tunnel events\n(Sec. V A). Then we construct the RG flow equations\n(Sec. V B), from which we obtain the weak coupling\nflow diagram (Sec. V C).\n\u2022 Sec. VI considers superconducting nanowires by considering them as the continuum limit of the JJ chains.\n\u2022 Sec. VII presents scaling forms for the resistivity of\nthe chain and discusses various interesting parameter\nregimes.\n\u2022 We conclude in Sec. VIII by reviewing the implications of our results for various experimental systems\nand raising open questions.\nSome technical details are relegated to the Appendix.\nC.\n\nB.\n\nOutline\n\nThis paper is organized as follows.\n\u2022 Sec. I provides a general introduction. Sec. I C introduces the two-fluid approach to mesoscopic superconducting grains, as first given in Ref. 58. Sec.

Following Refs. 11, 39, 40 we describe this system as a chain of\nresistively shunted Josephson junctions (Fig. 1(b)).

The grains are coupled by flows of both superconducting Cooper-pairs and normal electrons. (b) We model the system in (a) by a chain of superconducting grains connected\nby Josephson junctions and shunt resistors. (c) Two fluid model: each mesoscopic grain is represented as a combination of a\nsuperconducting and a normal parts, depicted here as separate grains. Charge relaxation between the S and N grains is via a\nconversion resistance r.\n\nthe superconducting grains comprise the superfluid, and\nelectrons that can flow in the shunting resistors the normal fluid. The presence of both fluids suggests considering each grain as consisting of two (physically overlapping) parts - a superconducting grain (S) and a normal\ngrain (N)- as shown in Fig. 1(c).\nChanges in the super or normal charge on a grain will\ninduce changes in the corresponding electrochemical potentials with the coefficients depending on both the capacitance of the grain and the compressibilities of the normal and superfluid components. A difference between the\nnormal and the superfluid electrochemical potentials will\nlead to charge relaxation between them; we model this as\na conversion current, IN S , through a phenomenological\nOhmic conversion resistance, r.\nThis classical model of a chain of grains can be made\ninto a quantum model straightforwardly by analogy with\nprevious work, e.g., ref. [58]. The length scale is set\nby the spacing, a, between the grain centers, and various time scales by the normal\u2013superfluid relaxation rate\nwithin a grain, the plasma frequency of the Josephson\njunctions, and the high frequency cutoffs of the superconducting degrees of freedom (typically of order the energy\ngap) and of the dissipative processes.\n\nWe will show that the behavior of the quantum chain\ndepends crucially on the normal-superfluid conversion resistance, r. In the limit r \u2192 0 the relaxation between the\nS and N fluids is infinitely fast, and our model reduces to\nthat of an RSJJ chain composed of macroscopic superconducting grains each with a single electrochemical potential . This is the limit studied previously [42, 43, 45].\nThe opposite limit, r \u2192 \u221e, describes a system with\npurely capacitative couplings between the S and the N\nfluids. This case has been discussed in Refs. 60, 61 and a\ntwo dimensional version realized experimentally. [52, 62]\nThe intermediate case of finite r involves new behavior,\nwhich, to our knowledge, has not been analyzed previously: it should be relevant for experiments on arrays of\nmesoscopic grains. The new physics associated with the\ninterplay between the S and N fluids dominates below\na temperature T \u2217 , roughly proportional to the electronenergy-level spacing within a grain. [58]\n\nNanowires\n\nThe two fluid model can be readily generalized to a\ncontinuous wire that is thin enough to ignore depen-\n\n\f4\ndences on the transverse coordinates. Classically, the corresponding two-fluid model is defined by the generalized\nJosephson equation for the superfluid current, Ohm's law\nfor the normal current, and a constitutive equation for\nthe conversion current,\n\u2202IS\n\u2202t\n\n= \u2212\u03a5\u2207VS ,\n\nIN = \u2212\u03c3\u2207VN\nIN S = \u03b3(VN \u2212 VS )\n\n(1)\n\nwith VS and VN the electrochemical potentials for the\nsuperfluid and normal electrons respectively. Note that\nfor a wire, the conversion current INS is a current per\nunit length, so \u03b3 has dimensions conductance per unit\nlength. \u03b3, the conductivity between the normal and superfluid parts, reflects the relaxation rate for a population imbalance between the two fluids, as investigated,\ne.g., by Clarke et al. [63]. The current equations must\nbe supplemented, as for the chain of grains, by current\nconservation laws and constitutive relations between the\nexcess normal and superfluid charge densities and the\nelectrochemical potentials; again these will involve compressibilities and capacitances.\nThe continuum two fluid equations, Eqs. (1), can be\nmade into a quantum model by defining the superfluid\nvelocity as the gradient of the superconducting phase,\nimposing phase-charge conjugation, and introducing appropriate degrees of freedom to mimic the dissipation\nassociated with the resistive processes. But, in addition, the superconducting phase should be allowed to\nundergo quantum phase-slips (QPS); these are implicit in\nthe chain of grains but not included in the linear continuum model (for a discussion of phase-slips see Sec. III).\nTo introduce phase slips, a short distance cutoff must be\nimposed. as, in contrast to the chain, there is no intrinsic\nlength scale. Care must be exercised,however, when imposing a cut-off on this nanowire model. For example, a\nsimple lattice regularization implicitly assumes that the\nsize of quantum phase slips is also the shortest possible distance between them. In reality the core size of a\nQPS is non-zero, but, if two phase slips occur at different\ntimes, their centers can be arbitrarily close to one other.\nWe discuss this important subtlety in detail in Sec. VI.\nD.\n\nOverview of Results\n\nBefore formulating the quantum model of a chain of\ngrains and analyzing it in detail, we give a brief overview\nof the results obtained in this paper.\nPhases\n\nThe JJ chain has two superfluid phases, which we call\nfully superconducting (FSC) and SC\u22c6 , plus a normal\n\nmetallic phase (NOR). [The two types of superconducting phases were discussed earlier in Refs. 42, 43, 45 and\nreferred to as SC-2 and SC-1. ] In the FSC phase, which\noccurs when dissipation is strong, quantum fluctuations\nare suppressed enough that conventional superconducting tunneling into a grain is possible, and the Josephson\njunctions behaves completely classically at zero temperature. Nevertheless the superconducting correlations are\nnot truly long range, but decay algebraically with distance. In the opposite limit, the normal phase, phase\nfluctuations are large, and number fluctuations are small,\nso that the charge of a grain is well defined and superconducting correlations decay exponentially.\nIn between the FSC and NOR phases is the SC\u22c6 phase,\nin which both the phases and the charges of individual\ngrains exhibit large fluctuations. Phase differences between grains, however, do exhibit quasi-long range order. In this remarkable phase, tunneling into a grain\nwill result in singular low energy behavior, and will be\nsuppressed, which is an indication of the strong fluctuation of the phase variables on each grain in this state.\nNevertheless a uniform supercurrent can flow through the\nchain unimpeded at low energies. The SC\u22c6 phase tends\nto occur when the dissipation is weak: at low energies\nin the SC\u22c6 phase, the dissipation is irrelevant with the\nquantitative values of the shunting, R, and conversion,\nr, resistances playing little role, in the determination of\nglobal transport properties.\nThe three phase structure is somewhat analogous to\nthe behavior of two-dimensional solids describable by\ndisclinations: at intermediate temperatures the disclinations bind into pairs forming dislocations - the hexatic\nphase with quasi-long range orientational order - and\nat lower temperatures, these dislocations bind into pairs\n- disclination quadrupoles - forming the solid phase\nwhich has true orientational long range order.\n\nTransitions\n\nThree types of quantum phase transitions occur between the three phases. We denote the critical values of\nparameters for these transitions, G, L and M for global,\nlocal and mixed respectively.\nSeparating the SC\u22c6 phase and the normal phase, is\na transition of Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) type driven by\nunbinding of pairs of quantum phase slips. It is thus controlled by an effective space-time phase \"stiffness\" parameter that we denote K, proportional to the square\nroot of the ratio of the Josephson and capacitative energies: the former favors superconductivity, while the latter\nfavors localization of charge, and hence normal behavior.\nWe refer to the SC\u22c6 -NOR transition, as it is intrinsically controlled by long-wavelength physics, we refer to\nas global (G). Interestingly, in this transition, the resistive shunts play almost no role: they are screened by the\n\n\f5\n\u2212\n\na.\n\nb.\nK 6\n\nK\n\nr/RQ =0\n\nSC *\n\n5\n\n(L)\n\n5\n\n(G)\n\n4\n\nFSC\n\n4\n\n(M)\n\n3\n\nr/RQ =0.3\n\n6\nSC *\n\n(L)\n\n(G)\n\nFSC\n\n3\n(M)\n\n2\n\n2\nNOR\n\n1\n\n1\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\nNOR\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nR Q /R\n\nc.\n\nK\n\n2\n\n2.5\nR Q /R\n\nr/RQ >1\n\n6\n\nSC *\n\n5\n\n(G)\n\n4\n3\n2\n\nNOR\n1\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\nR Q /R\n\u2212\n\nFIG. 2: Schematic phase diagram of the quantum\nq two fluid model of Fig. 1(c) as a function of the shunt resistance, R, and\nthe quantum superconducting stiffness, K = 2\u03c0\n\nEJ\nEC\n\n, for various values of the conversion resistance, r. The phase boundaries\n\n\u22c6\n\nbetween the FSC, SC , and NOR phases are of different nature: (G) indicates global (solid line), (L) local (dashed-dotted\nline), and (M) mixed (dashed lines). These come together at a multicritical point (black dot). The FSC-NOR phase boundary\nhas sections with three different characters, separated by bicritical points (gray dots) Most of the phase boundaries are derived\nfrom the strong Josephson limit (Sec. IV), but their positions will depend on the fugacity, \u03b6, of quantum phase slips, which\nshould be another axis. For small K, the weak coupling expansion (Sec. V) is needed: that portion of the FSC-NOR boundary\nis inferred from it.\n\nfluctuations of phase slip dipoles, i.e., a pair of phase-slip\nand anti-phase-slip occurring simultaneously on neighboring junctions. The dynamical exponent, z, that relates time or inverse-energy scales to length scales, is, for\nthis transition, equal to unity: zG = 1. Deviations from\ncriticality are only marginally relevant, in the RG sense,\nand give rise to characteristic energy scales going to zero\nat the critical point with the exponential form typical of\nKT transitions.\nBetween the two superconducting phases, the transition is driven by dissipation. It is essentially local (L),\nbeing related to the superconducting-normal transition of\na single Josephson junction. The important excitations\nthat control this local transition are phase slips between\none grain and the rest of the chain. In terms of individual\nquantum phase slips of the chain, these are equivalent to\nquantum phase slip dipoles, which, as mentioned above,\nconsist of a pair of opposite sign phase slips, one on each\nside of the grain. Associated with the locality of this\nphysics, there is no simple diverging length scale and the\n\ndynamical exponent is thus zL = \u221e. How the characteristic energy scale goes to zero at this transition depends\non values of resistances: the corresponding critical exponents vary continuously.\nPerhaps the most interesting transition is that which\ncan occur from the FSC phase directly to the normal\nphase: this is driven by changes in the dissipation, yet\nbecause it also involves destruction of superconductivity,\nit has mixed (M) character with both local and global aspects and involves the interplay between individual quantum phase slips, and phase slip dipoles. Related to this\nmore complicated mechanism, there is more than one\ntype of critical behavior - probably three types - for\nthe mixed transition.\nPhase diagram\n\nA schematic zero-temperature phase diagram for the\nchain is shown in Fig. 2. It is convenient to show this as\na function of the shunt resistance, RQ /R, and the stiff-\n\n\f6\nness superconducting stiffness, K, at various values of\nthe conversion resistance, r. [Although a fourth parameter, related to QPS fugacities, is really needed as well to\nexhibit the range of possible behaviors.] Here RQ is the\nquantum resistance for Cooper pairs:\nRQ =\n\nh\n\u2248 6.5k\u03a9.\n4e2\n\n(2)\n\nFor large r, r > RQ , the phase fluctuations on each grain\nare large, and only the normal and SC\u22c6 phases can exist. In this regime, the phase diagram is simple (Fig.\n2) with the global transition between these phases at\nK = KG \u2248 4. This transition is driven by proliferation of quantum phase slips, is analogous to the classical Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in two dimensions, and\nhas characteristic energy scale going to zero exponentially\nrapidly as the transition is approached, and a correlation\nlength that diverges with the inverse of this energy scale.\nFor intermediate r, RQ > r > rc \u2248 21 RQ , all three\nphases exist, but the mixed transition between the FSC\nand normal phases is always driven by dipoles. The critical R, RM , varies with r and weakly with K: it is close\nto when a particular combination of R and r is RQ . The\nenergy scale goes to zero as a power of |R \u2212 RM | with an\nexponent, \u03bc that varies continuously with r. The characteristic length scale on the normal side - associated with\nproliferation of individual dipoles - diverges as a power\nof R \u2212 RM with a continuously variable exponent that\nis not simply related to the that of the inverse energy\nscale. The FSC-SC\u22c6 local transition is similarly driven\nby dipoles, and occurs when the same combination of R\nand r, is close to RQ . The energy scale similarly goes to\nzero with a continuously variable exponent.\nFor r < rc \u2248 21 RQ , the phase diagram is far richer (Fig.\n2), and qualitatively similar to the previously studied\nr = 0 case of infinitely fast relaxation between the normal and superconducting electrons. The SC\u22c6 -normal\nand FSC-SC\u22c6 transitions are similar to the intermediate\nr regime discussed above. But the mixed-character phase\ntransition between the FSC and normal phases is more\ncomplicated. For large-intermediate Josephson coupling,\nKB < K < 4 with KB \u2264 2 depending on r and R, the\nmixed transition is similar to that in the intermediate r\nregime (above). In the limit of weak Josephson coupling\n- small K - its character is different. In this regime,\nthe mixed transition is most easily thought of as being\ndriven - from the normal phase - by Cooper-pair tunneling. It occurs when R = RM \u2248 RQ \u2212 2r with RM\ndecreasing to this value as K \u2192 0. There is power law\nscaling of energy in the vicinity of this transition, with\ncontinuously variable exponents.\nIn some regime of parameters, the small coupling and\nlarge-intermediate coupling phase boundaries may join\ntogether: if they do so, it will be in an intermediate coupling regime that is far from all three phases and thus for\nwhich we have no controlled methods to study. At this\n\npoint, it is not clear whether or not these two regimes can\njoin continuously. Naively , their character, particularly\nthe behavior of length scales, seems rather different. But\nit is possible that they are related and then could join\ncontinuously.\nIn the regime in which we can understand the behavior in terms of quantum phase slips, there is a section\nof the FSC-normal phase boundary which has different\ncharacter than those discussed above. For K < KB but\nnot too small - small-intermediate \u2013 direct proliferation\nof individual QPS (rather than their proliferation caused\nby dipole proliferation) drives the transition of the the\nFSC phase. Although the behavior is more subtle and\nthere are complicated crossovers, the asymptotic critical\nbehavior is similar to the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition\nbetween the SC\u22c6 and NOR phases with exponentially\nvanishing energy scale and length scale diverging as the\ninverse of this: i.e. isotropic behavior. Surprisingly, the\nlocation of the transition is determined by a combination\nof the low energy properties of the superconducting and\nnormal - i.e. dissipative - degrees of freedom. But how\nthis changes measurable asymptotic properties we have\nnot worked out.\nIn the low range of r in which the mixed transition can\nhave more than one character, the different sections of the\nphase diagram join together at two bicritical points. The\nweak-coupling power-law regime joins up to the smallintermediate coupling KT-like regime at a point that is\nneither near the K = 0 nor the large K regime and thus\nnot amenable to study by the methods we use. But the\nother bicritical point at which the dipole driven and individual QPS driven segments of the phase boundary come\ntogether can be analyzed: we discuss it briefly in Sec.\nIV G.\nThe three phases come together at a multicritical point\nas shown in the figures. The behavior near this point involves crossover from the FSC to either the SC\u22c6 or normal\nphase to the left of the nearly-vertical phase boundary.\nThe asymptotic critical behavior, however, is probably\ncontrolled by the SC\u22c6 phase. We have not investigated\nthis in detail.\n\nRenormalization group analysis\n\nThe primary methods we use are renormalizationgroup (RG) analyses of the effective low energy action\nfor the quantum two-fluid JJ chain model; both Coulomb\ngas and sine-Gordon representations of this action are\nderived and used in the various regimes. The zerotemperature phase diagram in various limits, and the\nnature of the quantum phase transitions more generally,\nare derived from these. The RG method naturally leads\nto detailed understanding of both the qualitative and the\nquantitative roles of various aspects of the model, for example, that the dissipation is irrelevant in the SC\u22c6 phase\n\n\f7\nand near the \"global\" normal-to-SC\u22c6 phase transition.\nFor the normal-to-FSC transition, on the other hand,\ndissipation plays a key role by suppressing local fluctuations of the phase, and the characteristic length scale is\nthe relaxation length between the superconducting and\nthe normal fluids; as r varies from zero and infinity, this\nlength-scale changes from the inter-grain spacing, a, to\ninfinity, although the low energy properties of the transition from the FSC to the SC\u22c6 phase remains \"local\".\nThe RG flow equations can also be used to obtain the\ntemperature dependence of various quantities, notably\nthe resistivity close to the superconductor-to-normal\ntransitions. In the vicinity of the global normal to\nSC\u22c6 transition the dissipation plays little role and the\ntemperature dependence of the measured total resistivity near this quantum KT transition has been analyzed\nby other authors [64, 65]. But in the vicinity of the mixed\nnormal to FSC transition, the behavior is strikingly different.\nThe RG analysis also gives information about\ncrossovers and regimes of validity of the asymptotic\nbehaviors. It is important to emphasize that over\nmuch of the parameter ranges, the superconductor-tonormal transitions are likely to be characterized by wide\ncrossover regions (see Fig. 2) in which, for example,\nthe resistivity can be almost temperature independent\nover extended temperature ranges. This may correspond to the \"supermetallic\" behavior in the vicinity of\nsuperconductor-to-normal transitions, that has been observed in several experiments in one dimensional [51, 66\u2013\n69] and two dimensional systems [47, 62].\nThe RG can also be used to study finite size properties and effects of boundary conditions. For example,\nwe show that when the RSJJ chain is connected to superconducting electrodes, at asymptotically low temperatures in the SC\u22c6 regime, the appropriate measure of the\ndissipation that controls the location of the macroscopic\nsuperconductor-to-normal transition is the total shunting resistance, in contrast to the traditional picture that\nthe local inter-grain shunting resistance will control the\nmacroscopic behavior (see also discussion, Sec. VIII).\n[70]\n\nNanowires\n\nLate in the paper we go briefly from the realm of discrete grains and Josephson junctions to that of continuous superconducting wires. For these there is a subtle\nquestion about whether the FSC phase exists. The approximate model we use, leads to the conclusion that it\ndoes not. If this is correct, then at sufficiently low temperatures, the wires will always approach the SC\u22c6 or the\nnormal phase, but there can be wide regimes of crossover\nin which FSC-like behavior may be observable. But aspects that have been left out of the model, in particular\n\naspects of charge discreteness and interference between\nquantum phase slips, may invalidate this conclusion. Preliminary indications are that these can stabilize the FSC\nphase. Its existence is thus left as an open question.\nII.\n\nMESOSCOPIC MODEL OF CHAIN OF\nGRAINS\n\nThe system we study consists of identical mesoscopic\nsuperconducting grains that are connected by weak links\nwhich allow the flow of both Cooper pairs and normal\nelectrons (Fig. 1(a)). The flow of Cooper pairs is via\nJosephson coupling between the grains and the flow of\nnormal electrons via shunting resistors. As discussed\nabove, it is convenient to describe this system in terms\nof a two fluid model. The superfluid is transported by\nCooper pairs tunneling between superconducting grains,\nand the normal fluid is transported by electrons through\nthe shunting resistors. Each grain is thus considered as\na double grain with superconducting and normal parts\nas shown in Fig. 1(c). The S (superconducting) and N\n(normal) parts of each grain experience the same electrostatic potential, \u03c6, but they will generally have different chemical potentials. [An analogous decoupling of the\nchemical potentials for the S and the N fluids near phaseslip centers in superconducting wires in the presence of a\ntransport current was discussed in Refs. 71\u201373.]\nThe possibility of having different chemical potentials\nfor the normal and superfluid components is a consequence of the mesoscopic size of the grains. The conversion resistance between the two fluids within a grain\nis proportional to some power of the size of a grain, and\ntherefore it will provide significant dissipation only for\nsmall grain sizes (see discussion in Appendix A and Ref.\n[58]). The dependence of r on the size of a grain should be\nobtained from an appropriate microscopic model, which\nis beyond the scope of this paper. The sum of the\nelectrostatic potential, \u03c6i and the chemical potentials,\n\u03bcN i , \u03bcS i , of the i'th grain yield the total normal and superfluid electrochemical potentials, VN i and VS i , which\nwill drive the currents.\nChanges in the total charge on a grain modify its electrostatic potential via the capacitance, C, while changes\nin the normal or superfluid charges on a grain correspondingly modify the chemical potentials with the coefficients\nthe inverse compressibilities DN or DS of the N and S\nfluids on an individual grain; these compressibilities thus\nhave the character of \"quantum capacitances\" [74].\nWhen the electrochemical potentials of the N and S\nfluids on a grain differ, relaxation processes will occur to\nequilibrate the two components. The simplest form for\nsuch relaxation is an Ohmic conversion current, IN S i :\n[58]\nIN S i =\n\nVN i \u2212 VS i\n,\nr\n\n(3)\n\n\f8\nwhere r is the conversion resistance within a grain. We\nassume that r remains finite even in the limit of zero\ntemperature.\nThe charge relaxation time between superconducting\nand normal fluids on a grain is set by the RC time of the\neffective circuit,\n\u03c4N S = r(DS + DN )\u22121 .\n\n(4)\n\nTherefore our assumption of an Ohmic conversion resistance is equivalent to assuming a form for the relaxation\nrate between the normal fluid and the superfluid.\nThe effective low-energy model of the system shown\nin Fig. 1(c) should include the charging energy for the\ngrains, the Josephson coupling energy, and appropriate\nheat bath Hamiltonians for the shunting and conversion\nresistors. We now construct the appropriate Hamiltonian\nand thence obtain the corresponding quantum action.\nWe start with the charging energies. The electrochemical potentials for the superconducting and the normal\nfluids include contributions from both electrostatic and\nelectrochemical \"capacitances\" (see Fig. 1(c))\nVS i = \u03c6i + DS QS i ,\nVN i = \u03c6i + DN QN i\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03c6i is the electric potential of grain i, and QS i , QN i\nare the superconducting and the normal parts of the\ncharge on grain i; and DS and DN are the inverses of\nthe compressibilities of the S and N grains respectively.\nIn this paper we consider a simplified model in which\nonly the self-capacitance of each grain, C, is included.\nWe can then write the electric potential as\n\u03c6i =\n\n1\n(QS i + QN i ) .\nC\n\n(6)\n\nWe expect that including mutual capacitances between\nthe grains [75, 76] will not change the qualitative conclusions, although it may modify the energy scales involved.\nBy integrating the electrochemical potentials in (5)\nwith respect to the charge, we obtain the charging part\nof the Hamiltonian. The resulting term is\nP\nHQ = 12 (C \u22121 + DS ) Q2S i +\ni P\nP\n(7)\n1\n\u22121\n+ DN ) Q2N i + C \u22121 QS i QN i .\n2 (C\ni\n\n[QN i , \u03c7j ] = \u2212ie\u03b4ij\n\n[QSi , \u03c6i ] = \u22122ie\u03b4ij\n\n[QN i , \u03c6j ] = 0\n\n[QSi , \u03c7j ] = 0.\n\n(8)\n\nThe physical interpretation of \u03c7i follows from the observation that its time derivative gives the electro-chemical\npotential of the normal fluid, by analogy with the Josephson relation for the superfluid [34, 37, 77].\nThe Hamiltonian term arising from the Josephson tunneling between grains can be readily written in terms of\n\u03c6i :\nHJ = \u2212EJ\n\nX\nhiji\n\ncos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j ),\n\n(9)\n\nwhere the summation is over nearest-neighbor grains, i\nand j. EJ is the Josephson coupling energy of the Josephh\u0304\nIJ in terms of IJ , the\nson junctions, given by EJ = 2e\ncritical current of the junctions.\nThe dissipative parts of the system can be described by\nheat bath Hamiltonians with appropriately chosen spectral functions. These are written as follows,\nHdis =\n\nX\nhiji\n\nHbath (R, 2\u03c7i \u2212 2\u03c7j ) +\n\nX\ni\n\nHbath (r, \u03c6i \u2212 2\u03c7i )\n\n(10)\nWe do not give the explicit form of Hbath here, but below\nprovide the corresponding effective actions obtained after\nintegrating out the heat-bath degrees of freedom. The\ncrucial requirement for Ohmic heat baths is that their\ndensity of states is linear at low frequencies. Note that\nthis is the case for particle-hole excitations of a Fermi liquid, one likely source of dissipation in dirty gapless superconductors especially near transitions to normal metallic\nbehavior.\nCombining Eqs.(7) - (10) we construct the imaginary\ntime action and partition function for the RSJJ array of\nFig. 1(c):\n\ni\n\nZ=\n\ni\nS = \u2212 2e\n\nIn order to write down the action for the dissipative\nand Josephson terms, we define phase-angles conjugate\nto the charges QS and QN .

From Eq.(23), one finds that T \u2217 is\nproportional to the escape time of normal electrons from\nthe grain, i.e., to the Thouless time of the grain. It is thus\nvery large for macroscopic grains, but its existence is an\nessential property of the mesoscopic physical content of\nour model.\nAt temperatures higher than T \u2217 , the dissipation across\nseparate junctions is effectively decoupled. In contrast,\nfor T \u226a T \u2217 , the interactions between dissipation across\ndifferent junctions and within different grains are important. These interactions are crucial for the quantum dynamics. At low energies, the existence of the compressibilities thus matters crucially. although the values of the\nD's do not.\nBefore proceeding with more sophisticated analyses, it\nis instructive to consider the linearized dynamics in the\npresence of dissipation. As all the terms in the model action except the Josephson coupling are quadratic, we can\nintegrate out all but the superconducting phase, \u03c6, and\nexpand the Josephson coupling energy about zero phase\ndifference. This results in a rather messy form of the\naction that is given in Appendix A. In the limit of low\nfrequencies and long wavelengths the dissipative effects\nare negligible and all that matters are the conventional\nsuperconducting parts of the action including the suppression of imaginary-time changes of the phase by the\ninverse of the total effective charging energy. These give\nrise to the simple phase modes discussed above. Nevertheless, the fact that the short wavelength fluctuations\nare controlled by the dissipation, makes the terms that\nappear negligible at long wavelengths also important for\nthe quantum dynamics and thence the phase diagram.\nIn the absence of dissipative effects, the mean square\nfluctuations of the phase difference between neighboring\ngrains would be inversely proportional to the quantum\nstiffness, K. But these fluctuations are dominated by\nwavelengths of order the inter-grain spacing, and frequencies of order the Josephson junction plasma frequency\n(proportional to c/a). Thus, in actuality, the modes that\ndominate the phase fluctuations will be affected by much\nof the details of the high frequency dynamics, including\nthe dissipation and the cutoff frequencies of both the dissipative and the superconducting degrees of freedom. We\nwill often crudely approximate these by a high-frequency\ncutoff \u03a90 . The short wavelength processes also control\nthe action of a quantum phase slip via properties of its\ncore, including its space-time size and \"shape\"; in particular, the \"fugacity\" of phase slips will be exponentially\nsmall when their core action is large.\n\nR\n\nR\n\nr\n\nR\n\nr\n\nC\n\nR\n\nr\n\nC\n\nR\n\nr\n\nC\n\nC\n\nPhase\u2212Slip\n\nFIG. 3: A phase slip creates a potential drop across the junction, which propagates currents in the rest of the chain.\n\nBecause of the importance of the high energy physics,\nit is not obvious what the significant dimensionless parameters are, beyond the obvious one discussed above,\nnor what role these might play at low energies. In practice, whether a chain of grains is in a \"strong\" or a \"weak\"\nJosephson coupling regime will be determined by many\nproperties. Thus we will use these terms loosely to describe various regimes in which the behavior simplifies:\nsmall QPS \"fugacity\", \u03b6 for strong coupling, and small\nCooper pair tunneling rates for weak coupling. Care must\nthus be exercised in considering phase diagrams of more\nexplicit models as changing one parameter can result in,\nfor example, changing both the low frequency dissipation,\nand the fugacity of quantum phase slips.\nTo simplify discussions of phase boundaries and the\nbehavior near them, we will generally consider tuning\nthe shunt resistance R and the strength of the Josephson\ncoupling, either EJ itself or the QPS fugacity as a proxy\nfor this. The phase diagrams in general need to be considered as functions of both r and parameters related to\nother high energy processes as well.\n\nB.\n\nCircuit analysis\n\nIn the analysis of the two junction problem in Ref. 58\nwe showed that electrical circuit properties determined\nthe (lowest order) RG flows in various limits. Before\nproceeding further, we analyze the linearized electrodynamics of the chain model to gain insight into its behavior.\nThe basis of the circuit approach is the following simple interpretation of the dissipation-driven transition in\na single resistively shunted Josephson junction [34, 37].\nWhen the junction is in the insulating state, the Cooper\npairs are localized on the electrodes, and the phase difference across the junction is uncertain due to proliferation\nof quantum phase slips (QPS). In the opposite limit when\nthe junction is superconducting, the phase difference between the grains is well defined and, phase slips will not\noccur on long time scales. A phase slip across the junction causes a voltage burst with the Josephson relation\n\n\f11\ngiving\n\nCooper pair tunneling\n\nZ\n\ndtV (t) =\n\n2\u03c0h\u0304\nh\n=\n2e\n2e\n\n(25)\n\nwhich leads to a current flow in the shunting resistor,\nRS . It turns out that the superconducting state of the\njunction is stable only when a single QPS would cause a\ncharge flow, \u2206Q, which is more than a Cooper pair charge\n2e. From Ohm's law we then obtain \u2206Q/2e = RQ /RS ,\nso superconductivity will be observed when RS < RQ .\nA related analysis from the insulating state in terms of\nCooper pair tunneling events can be used to argue for\nthe same condition: RS > RQ stabilizes the insulating\nstate.\n\n\u2206\u03c6 =\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c6\ndt\n=\ndt\n\nZ\n\ndt\n\n2eV (t)\n2eV (\u03c9 = 0)\n2eI(\u03c9 = 0)Z(\u03c9 = 0)\n2e\u2206QZS\nZS\n=\n=\n=\n= 2\u03c0\nh\u0304\nh\u0304\nh\u0304\nh\u0304\nRQ\n\nwith I the current, \u2206Q = 2e the charge transfered, and\nZ the impedance. Thus we see that the phase difference\nbetween the grains will change by more than or less than\n2\u03c0 according to whether the shunting impedance, ZS =\nR+2r, is more or less than RQ . Since the transition from\nthe normal phase to the FSC phase in which each grain\nhas a well-defined SC phase is via this local process, it is\nnot surprising that the condition for this to occur involves\n\nSpt = h\u0304\n\nZ\n\nQ\nd\u03c6 =\n2e\n\nZ\n\ndtQ(t)V (t) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0h\u0304(R + 2r)\n.\nRQ\n\n(28)\n\nIn imaginary time, the 1/(\u2212i\u03c9+0) becomes 1/|\u03c9| and the\nintegral over frequencies diverges logarithmically at low\nfrequencies or low temperatures. It is exactly the competition between this logarithmic action and the quantum\n\"entropy\" - log of the range of imaginary time h\u0304/T -\nin which the event can occur - that determines whether\nthe junction is superconducting, as we shall see. In real\n\n(26)\n\nthis combination. As we shall see, the behavior is in fact\nmore subtle due to the effects of multiple Cooper pair\ntunnels on each other.\nIt is also instructive to consider the classical action\nassociated with the tunneling of a Cooper pair. Since\nthe phase and the Cooper pair number are canonically\nconjugate, the action will be given by\n\nd\u03c9\nQ(\u03c9)V (\u2212\u03c9) =\n2\u03c0\n\nnote the integral of the potential energy appearing. Since\nin the limit of zero frequency the impedance is purely real\nand I(\u03c9) \u2192 2e, the zero frequency part of this integral\ngives \u03c0h\u0304ZS /RQ . The finite frequency parts will be negligible if the transfer is slow; otherwise they will decrease\nthe action so that\nSpt \u2264\n\nIn the normal phase the grains are only coupled resistively, although they can exhibit superconducting correlations within each grain. Thus we can consider a putative Cooper pair tunneling from one grain to the next.\nThis is very similar to the single junction case, except\nthat now the total shunt resistance is R + 2r because\nof the contributions of the conversion resistances in each\ngrain (see Fig. 3). We are interested in the effect of this\ntunneling on the SC phase difference, \u03c6 \u2261 \u03c6i+1 \u2212\u03c6i across\nthe junction. By the Josephson relation, the change in \u03c6\nis given by\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c9 I(\u03c9)\nV (\u2212\u03c9) =\n2\u03c0 \u2212i\u03c9 + 0\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c9 Z(\u03c9)|I(\u03c9)|2\n;\n2\u03c0 (\u2212i\u03c9 + 0)\n\n(27)\n\ntime, the significance of Eq. (28) is not clear, in particular, whether exp(iS/h\u0304) = exp(i\u03c0) is significant as far\nas whether or not Cooper pair tunnels can destructively\ninterfere, and if they can, thereby suppressing superconductivity for large shunt resistance.\nEffective shunting resistance in the strong Josephson\ncoupling limit\n\nWe now turn to the superconducting phase in which\nthe Josephson junctions are all superconducting. Consider a phase slip across one junction in the chain. By\nanalogy with the single junction case, one would guess\nthat the relevant quantity is the low frequency limit of the\nimpedance, Z(\u03c9), of the circuit parallel to it. This parallel circuit involves all the other superconducting junc-\n\n\f12\nR\n\nR\n\nR\n\nr\n\nR\n\nr\n\nR\n\nr\n\nr\n\nR\n\nR\n1\n0\n1\n0\n\nR0\n\nR0\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\n=\n\nR0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\nr\n\nR0\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\nFIG. 4: The resistor network parallel to a single phase slip.\nThe shunting resistance can be calculated using the \"infinite\nresistor chain\" trick.\n\ntions and the resistors. The total dissipation now comes\nfrom both the network of the Ohmic resistors and the\nJosephson junction chain itself.\nThe parallel shunting impedance of a junction in the\nchain splits into two contributions: the resistance of the\nnetwork of resistors r and R, and the impedance of the\n\"telegraph line\" of the chain. The first part is self exs\nplanatory; let us denote it as Ref\nf . The second piece\nrequires an explanation. When the Josephson coupling\nis strong we can assume that Josephson junctions are superconducting except for the times in which they exhibit\na phase slip. A superconducting Josephson junction has\nthe impedance of a solenoid with the (\"kinetic\") inductance L = h\u0304/(2e)2 EJ\u22121 . Therefore the line of junctions\nand capacitors resembles a line of solenoids and capacitors, a simple model of a telegraph line. When a phase\nslip occurs, it creates a short-lived voltage drop on the\njunction (see Fig. 3). This pulse has two effects; the first\nis a DC current that flows through the shunt and conversion resistors, R and r and the second effect is sending\nplasma waves through the line of junctions and capacitors. The latter also behaves like a resistance as it corresponds to energy being carried away by plasmons. Let\nus denote the effective resistance describing this mechP\nanism of dissipation as Ref\nf . The two mechanisms of\ndissipation separate at low frequencies, since the resistive contribution comes from local currents which decay\nrapidly, whereas the plasmon contributions arises from\nwaves propagating at speed c. Hence, the two mechanisms are totally out of phase with each other at low\nfrequencies.\nThe effective resistance a phase slip feels due to the\nplasmons is\nr\n1 p\nL\n2\nP\n= 2RQ *\n(29)\nEC /EJ = RQ\nReff = 2\nC\n2\u03c0\nK\n(see, for instance, Appendix 5D of Ref. 80). Note that\nP\nReff\ninclude contributions from the telegraph lines on\nboth sides of the given junction.\n\ns\nThe resistance Ref\nf can be found easily using the construction in Fig. 4. In the figure it is shown that the\nshunting resistance can be broken into three resistors in\nseries, where the semi-infinite ladder of resistors\u221ar and R\n2 +4rR\nis replaced by an effective resistor, R0 = \u2212R+ R\n.\n2\nWe thus have an effective shunting resistance of the network of Ohmic resistors\np\nRQ\ns\n.\n(30)\nRef\nR2 + 4rR =\nf = 2R0 + R =\n\u03b1\n\nThe total impedance, ZS = Z(\u03c9 = 0), shunting a junction in the fully superconducting phase (FSC) is thus\ngiven by the two contributions in parallel:\nRQ\n1\n= K +\u03b1 :\nZS\n2\n\n(31)\n\nas we shall see, this combination controls the action of\nQPS in the FSC phase. From analogy with the single\nRSJJ case, we would expect that the FSC phase would\nbecome unstable to QPS when the effective inverse shunting resistance equals RQ . As above for Cooper pair tunneling, we can see that the charge transfered associated\nwith the quantum phase slip of 2\u03c0 is V (\u03c9 = 0)/ZS =\n2eRQ /ZS . Again by analogy with the Cooper pair tunneling, we can consider the action associated with the\nphase slip, finding that this is \u2264 \u03c0h\u0304RQ /ZS . Thus we\nwould guess that the condition for suppression of QPS\ntunneling is when\nK\nRQ\n=\n+ \u03b1 \u2265 1.\nZS\n2\n\n(32)\n\nHowever, this analogy reflects only the local physics of\nphase slips and leads to the wrong condition: nevertheless, as we shall see, the correct condition involves the\nsame combination.\nIn Sec. VII we discuss a region of parameter space in\nthe NOR phase which we call a quasi-metallic regime. In\nthis region the measured resistance of the JJ chain first\nslowly drops as the temperature is lowered. But then,\nwhen a crossover temperature is reached, the resistance\ntakes a sharp upturn (see Fig. 12). This effect occurs\nin the region of the NOR phase where the (wrong) local\ncondition for the stability of the FSC phase to single\nphase slips (Eq. 32) is fulfilled, but the FSC is unstable\nagainst dipoles.\nTo fully understand the effects of QPS, we also need to\nconsider phase slip dipoles in which a phase slip occurs\non one junction simultaneously with a phase slip of the\nopposite sign on another junction - say s grains away.\nIn the simplest case, s = 1, this has the effect of slipping\nthe phase of one grain relative to the rest of the system\nto which it is coupled. More generally, s-dipoles slip the\nphase of s consecutive grains relative to the rest of the\nchain. Because the effects of the two opposing phase slips\ncancel at long length scales, there will be no contribution\n\n\f13\nR\n\nr\n\nR\n\nR0\n\nr\n\nR\n\nR\n\nR\n\nR0\n\nR0\n\nR0\n\nR\n\nr\n\nI dipoles\n\nR\n\nr\n\nI dipoles\n\nC\n\nR\n\nr\n\nI dipoles\n\nC\n\nC\nEffective Capacitance\nDue to dipoles\n\nFIG. 5: Effective circuit for a phase-slip dipole with s = 1.\nR0 is the effective resistance of a semi-infinite resistor ladder\nas given above Eq.

Considering all but the two\njunctions across which the slips occur, to be superconducting and thus short circuits at low frequencies, the\neffective shunt conductance between a row of s grains\nand the rest of the chain is found to be Fig. 5,\nRQ\n= 2\u03b1(1 \u2212 ws ),\nS\nRdipole\n\n(33)\n\nwhere\n\u221a\nR\u2212 4rR+R2\n2r\n\nr\n\nC\n\nPhase\u2212Slip Dipole\n\nw =1+\n\nR\n\n<1 \u03b1=\n\n\u221a 1\n.\nR2 +4rR\n\n(34)\n\nOf particular importance is the resistance between one\ngrain and the rest of the chain that shunts \u221a\nthe two (parallel) Josephson junctions.

But in the SC\u22c6 phase the superconducting phases\nof the individual grains fluctuate strongly enough to decouple the superconductivity from the resistive shunts.\nIn this case the energy of phase slips is primarily dissipated by the plasmons and the relevant impedance beP\ncomes just the Ref\nf = 2RQ /K with K the dimensionless\nsuperconducting quantum stiffness.\nA well known result is that a Josephson junction in its\ninsulating state seems like a capacitor (see, for instance,\nAppendix 5E of Ref. 80). For dipole proliferation, the\nrelevant junction is the combined junction from one grain\nto the rest of the system. To show this we first note that\nthe effective capacitance of a Josephson junction when\nphase slips proliferate describes the electrical response of\nthe \"plasma\" of phase slips. This effective capacitor is\ncharged whenever current tries to cross the junction itself.\n\nFIG. 6: Phase-slip dipoles create an effective capacitance\nwhich inhibits current from leaving the line of Josephson junctions. This capacitance screens the normal-to-superconductor\nconversion resistance, r. But it only renormalizes the plasmawave dissipation via the change of the total effective capacitance of each grain.\n\nFor a dipole, the relevant current is the current that tries\nto leave the horizontal Josephson-junction line in Fig. 6.\nThe current leaving the junction-line into the vertically\ndrawn wire is the only current that interacts with phase\nslip dipoles, hence the effective capacitor that appears\nwhen dipoles proliferate can get charged only by the current associated with Idipoles as in the Figure (6). This\neffective capacitance thus occurs between the superconducting and normal parts of a junction, and it is in series\nto the finite conversion resistance which is important at\nlow frequencies - \u03c9 \u226a T \u2217 /h\u0304. When dipoles proliferate, they effectively block the low-frequency conversion,\nas the effective capacitance of the dipoles dominates.\nThe induced capacitance due to dipoles blocks the N-S\nconversion in each grain, and thus screens the dissipative\ninteraction between phase slips: at low frequencies, this\nis essentially equivalent to setting r \u2192 \u221e. But the plasmon interaction is a dynamic effect. As can be seen from\nFig. 6, the dipole-induced capacitance renormalizes the\nself capacitance C of each grain. Thus the plasmon interaction survives the proliferation of dipoles, albeit with\na renormalized plasma speed. These results are formally\nderived in Sec. IV B from the effective action of the chain.\nSince dipoles disconnect the N-S conversion, in the\nSC\u22c6 phase, the effective shunting resistance that is felt\nby a phase slip in the JJ chain is just that from the renormalized plasmon impedance. Therefore,\nRQ\nK\n= .\ns\nRtotal\n2\n\n(35)\n\ns\nRtotal\nis the effective local dissipation in the SC\u22c6 phase.\nOne would expect, in analogy to the single junction that\nwhen\ns\nRQ /Rtotal\n<1\n\n(36)\n\nthe SC\u22c6 phase would be unstable to QPS proliferation.\nAs we shall see, the relationship between this shunting\nimpedance and the stability of the SC\u22c6 phase to QPS,\nis different than that for a single junction, essentially\ndue to the \"entropy\" of the translational freedom of the\n\n\f14\nQPS. Nevertheless, as in the case of the FSC-NOR QPSdriven transition, the local condition in Eq. (36) demarcates the regime with non-monotonic temperature dependence of the resistivity. In the region of the NOR phase\nwhere condition (36) applies, there will be a low-energy\ncrossover between a decreasing resistance as temperature\ndecreases, to insulating behavior (see Sec. VII).\n\nCoulomb Gas Representation\n\nTo analyze the effects of QPS in the partition function,\nit is convenient to use a Villain transformation. As usual\nfirst writing\n\bR\nexp\nd\u03c4 EJ [cos (\u03c6i+1 (\u03c4 ) \u2212 \u03c6i (\u03c4 )) \u2212 1]\no\nn R\nP\n2\n\u2248\nexp \u2212 d\u03c4 E2J [\u03c6i+1 (\u03c4 ) \u2212 \u03c6i (\u03c4 ) + 2\u03c0\u03bci (\u03c4 )]\n{\u03bci (\u03c4 )}\n\nIII.\n\nSTRONG JOSEPHSON COUPLING LIMIT\n\nWe now turn to the analysis of the low energy properties of the chain, going well beyond the linear electrodynamics discussed in the previous section. We first derive\nthe quantum-phase-slip Coulomb-gas representation of\nthe action (Sec.III A and transform it into a sine-Gordon\nrepresentation (Sec. III B). This enables analysis of the\nphases of the JJ chain (Sec. III C), and an RG approach\nfor the phase diagram (Sec. III D).\n\nA.\n\nQuantum Phase Slips and Representations of\nthe Partition Function\n\nIn the limit of strong Josephson coupling, the phase differences between neighboring grains will predominantly\nbe localized in the vicinity of the minima of the Josephson\npotential which occur at \u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j = 2\u03c0nij , with nij an integer. Occasionally, however, the phases will depart from\ntheir classical superconducting form, and tunnel between\nneighboring minima with different nij : these events are\nquantum phase slips (QPS). Note that as discussed in\nthe section on parameters, strong coupling will in practice be defined by the rareness of QPS which depends\non the high energy physics as well as the dimensionless\nJosephson coupling, K 2 \u221d EJ /EC .\nPhysically, QPS at zero temperature are caused by\nthe charging energy (in Eq. 12) not commuting with\nthe Josephson potential. Quantum phase slips correspond to vortex-like phase configurations in the space-\u03c4\n(imaginary-time) plane, while in real time they involve\nthe launching of one dimensional plasma-waves (plasmons) through the chain.\nAt low temperatures, quantum phase slips may destroy\nsuperconducting coherence in the JJ array, and their potential role in this way makes them the basic excitations in terms of which the low energy physics can most\nreadily be described when the local superconductivity is\n\"strong\". We can thus try to expand in the QPS fugacity\nin this strong Josephson coupling limit. As we shall see,\none also has to consider phase slip dipoles: bound pairs\nof QPS of opposite signs.\n\n(37)\nThe Villain transformation breaks the cosine function of\nphase differences down to a sum over its troughs with\n\u03bci (\u03c4 ) an integer valued function labeling the troughs in\nthe Josephson potential of the junction between the i +\n1'th and the i'th grains. A phase slip on the j'th junction\ncorresponds to a sudden change of \u03bcj by \u00b11, thus we can\nwrite it in terms of a density of discrete QPS:\n\u03c1QP S (j, \u03c4 ) =\n\n\u2202\u03bcj (\u03c4 ) X\n=\npm \u03b4j,jm \u03b4(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4m ),\n\u2202\u03c4\nm\n\n(38)\n\nwith the m'th QPS with \"charge\" pm = \u00b11 occurring at\nimaginary time \u03c4m and on junction jm . Periodic boundary conditions on the original phases, \u03c6i (\u03c4 = 0) = \u03c6i (\u03c4 =\n\u03b2) imply an integrated neutrality condition for each junction:\nZ \u03b2\n\u03c1QP S (j, \u03c4 )d\u03c4 = 0\n\u2200j .\n(39)\n0\n\nUsing Eq. (37) in the partition function, Eq. (12),\nmakes the action quadratic in \u03c6i as well as in the other\nfields, all of which can be integrated out to obtain the\npartition function solely in terms of the QPS configurations. The action of a set of N QPS with integer charges\n{pm } at space time locations {(xm = ajm , \u03c4m )} , with\n(integer) jm labeling junctions, has the form:\nSN ({pm }) =\n\nN\n1 X\npm pn G(xm \u2212 xn , \u03c4m \u2212 \u03c4n ),\n2\n\n(40)\n\nm6=n\n\nwhere G(x, \u03c4 ) is the interaction between phase slips. The\nQPS partition function is then:\nZQP S =\n\nX\u0303\n\n\u03b6 N exp [\u2212SN ({pm })] ,\n\n(41)\n\n{pm }\n\nwith \u03b6 the fugacity of QPS; \u03b6 has units of frequency: in\nthe absence of interactions between them, it would be\nthe rate at which phase slips of each sign occur across a\nsingle junction. Its bare value is obtained by considering\nthe action of the instanton which describes the short time\nmotion of the phase variables following a phase slip in \u03bci .\nThe sum in Eq. (41) is over distinguishable QPS configurations with the restriction that for each junction the\ntotal QPS charge is zero - a neutrality condition. Note\n\n\f15\nthat strictly speaking, because of this local neutrality,\nwith m and n on different junctions G(xm \u2212 xn , \u03c4m \u2212 \u03c4n )\nis only the finite part of the interaction: the infinite parts\nthat would arise if the local neutrality condition were not\nsatisfied have been subtracted out.\nThe full form of the interaction between the QPS is\nvery complicated and has several different regimes. As\ndiscussed in the introduction, the temperature (energy)\nscale that arises from the dissipation and the finite size\nof the grains, T \u2217 , plays an important role. At temperatures higher than T \u2217 dissipation on separate junctions is\neffectively decoupled. By contrast, at low temperatures,\nT < T \u2217 , there is considerable interaction between QPS\non neighboring junctions: we focus here and henceforth\non this low temperature regime.\nLow Temperature Limit\n\nIn the low temperature limit, T \u226a T \u2217 , the effective\ninteractions between QPS is given by\n\u03c40\n\u03c40\n, (42)\nG(x, \u03c4 ) \u2248 K log p\n+ \u03b1e\u2212|x|/\u03bbQ log\n2\n2\n2\n|\u03c4\n|\nx /c + \u03c4\np\nwhere the quantum stiffness K = 2\u03c0 EJ /EC , (assuming\nDN, SC C \u226a 1), the Mooij-Sch\u00f6n velocity c =\n\u221a\nEJ EC\na h\u0304 , and the strength of the dissipative interactions,\nRQ\n\u03b1= \u221a\n,\n2\nR + 4rR\n\nGlocal (x, \u03c4 ) = a\u03b4(x)\n(43)\n\nwere all introduced earlier, and the characteristic length\nscale is\n\u03bbQ =\n\na\nlog(1/w)\n\np \u0001\n\u03b1 \u03c02 arctan \u03c0 Rr : this is close to Eq.(43) over the whole\nrange but does not correctly correspond to the shunt resistance. Similarly, in the continuum approximation,\n\u03bbQ\np\nwould always have its asymptotic form, a r/R.]\nThe cutoff for\n\u221a the plasma interaction is given by\n\u03c40 \u223c a/c = h\u0304/ EJ EC . The cutoff for the dissipative\ninteraction in the strong coupling limit,\n\u221a on the other\nhand, is \u03c40 \u223c min{h\u0304RQ /(R + 2r)EJ , h\u0304/ EJ EC }. When\nR + 2r \u226b RQ the cutoff time for the local interaction is\nlower than that for the isotropic plasmon-related interaction. This may give rise to additional\n\u221a crossovers in the\ntemperature range REJ /RQ > T > EJ EC . However,\nwe will only analyze the Coulomb-gas action,\nEq. (42),\np\nfor energy scales and temperatures \u03a9 < EJ /EC .\nThe two logarithmic interactions between QPS in Eq.\n(42) have very different physical origins. The first part,\nwhich is isotropic in space-time, is present for 1+1 dimensional X-Y models even in the absence of dissipation; it\ngives rise to a quantum Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, as\noriginally discussed by Bradley and Doniach [75] (see also\nRef. [81]). The second term in Eq. (42) originates from\nthe Ohmic dissipation. It is logarithmic in the time separation of phase-slips. Only the limit r = 0 (\u03bbQ = 0) has,\nto our knowledge, been analyzed previously [42, 43, 45].\nIn this limiting case the dissipative interaction of Eq.\n(42) takes the form:\n\n(44)\n\nwith\n\u221a\n4rR + R2\nw =1+\n(45)\n2r\np\nwhich is approximately 1 \u2212 R/r when R \u226a r. The\norigin of \u03bbQ is the decay length of currents in the resistive\nnetwork shown in Fig. 4, and can also be inferred from\nthe continuum equations (1).\nThe discreteness of the chain is important even at large\nlength scales, particularly when \u03bbQ is comparable to a.\nThe strength of the dissipative interaction arises from\nZ\ndk\nRQ a\n.\n(46)\n\u03b1=\n2\u03c0 r(2 \u2212 2 cos ka) + R\n\n\u03c40\n1\nlog\n.\nR\n|\u03c4 |\n\n(47)\n\nMore generally, for non-zero r, the length scale, \u03bbQ , is the\nrange of normal currents that are induced when a phase\nslip occurs and thus, effectively, the dissipative size of\na QPS: \u03bbQ , controls the exponential fall-off with spatial\nseparation of the dissipative interactions between QPS's.\nNot surprisingly, \u03bbQ plays a particularly important role\nin the physics of finite length chains [70].\n\nR\u2212\n\n|k|<km\n\nThis yields simply the inverse of the shunt resistance for\na single junction, as found in Sec. II B. [In the continuum approximation with a sharp momentum space\ncutoff at \u03c0/a the QPS interaction would yield \u03b1 =\n\nB.\n\nSine-Gordon Representation\n\nFrom the Coulomb gas partition function, Eq. (40),\nwe derive the sine-Gordon representation of the strong\nJosephson coupling limit. The Coulomb gas representation provides an expression for the probabilities of specific\nconfigurations of phase slips, whereas the sine-Gordon\nrepresentation is more amenable to a renormalization\ngroup analysis. We introduce two separate HubbardStratonovich fields, \u03b8j and \u03c8j located on the junctions\nbetween the grains (j, j + 1), in order to decouple the\ntwo contributions to the interactions between QPS of Eq.\n(42) (for details see Appendix 5A.2 of Ref. 80): in terms\nof the physical variables, \u03c8 decouples the normal degrees\nof freedom, and \u03b8 + \u03c8 the superconducting degrees of\nfreedom. This transformation yields the dual action of\n\n\f16\nthe model of Eqs.

Otherwise, this term is completely analogous to\nthe cosine term in Eq. (48). Note that the dipole term resembles the Josephson term in the original action for the\nJJ array, Eq. (12), but it is written in the dual variables.\nThe similarity is explained by the following description\nof the effect of the two terms: cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j ) removes a\nCooper-pair at site j, and creates a Cooper pair at site i.\nSimilarly, cos [(\u03b8i (\u03c4 ) + \u03c8i (\u03c4 )) \u2212 (\u03b8j (\u03c4 ) + \u03c8j (\u03c4 ))], creates\na phase-slip on bond i, and an anti-phase-slip on bond j.\nInitially, there are no phase slip dipoles, and \u03b7s = 0 for\nall s. However, upon coarse-graining in time, dipoles will\nform and have to be analyzed as independent entities, on\nthe same footing as single phase slips.\n\nand\n\nPhase-slip Dipoles\n\nIn our recent work on pairs of shunted Josephson junctions [82], we demonstrated the important role of QPS\ndipoles: these are instantons consisting of two opposite\nsign QPS that occur almost simultaneously on nearby\njunctions. The simplest phase-slip dipole, on neighboring\njunctions, is thus an event in which the phase of a single\ngrain slips by 2\u03c0 relative to the chain. In non-dissipative\nXY models such dipoles disappear when short wavelength\nfluctuations are integrated out isotropically in space and\ntime, and the closely-spaced dipoles act only to renormalize the stiffness \u03ba and thereby the interaction between\nother QPS.\nFor granular systems with dissipation, the physics on\nthe scale of the grains plays an essential role, and a better approach is to perform the RG procedure in time\nonly. This means that dipoles remain as independent\ndegrees of freedom and should be considered explicitly\nalong with individual QPS. [Although it is clumsy to do\nso, we will show later that the results for the isotropic\nKosterlitz Thouless transition can be recovered from this\nanisotropic RG. ] Dipoles can be included in the sineGordon representation by adding the following term to\nthe action\n\u221e\nP\n\ns=1\n\nSdipole =\n\u03b7s\n\nPR\ni\n\n=\n\nd\u03c4 cos [(\u03b8i (\u03c4 ) + \u03c8i (\u03c4 )) \u2212 (\u03b8i+s (\u03c4 ) + \u03c8i+s (\u03c4 ))]\nPPR\ni\n\nd\u03c4 \u03b7s cos [Ds \u03b8i (\u03c4 ) + Ds \u03c8i (\u03c4 )]\n\ns\n\n(51)\nwith \u03b7s the dipole fugacity for a dipole with separation sa\nbetween its positive and negative QPS; we will refer to s,\nloosely, as the moment of the dipole; Ds is the difference\noperator of distance s: Ds \u03b8i \u2261 \u03b8i+s \u2212 \u03b8i .\nThe argument of the cosine function in Eq. (51) places\ntwo phase slips of opposite signs on junctions a distance\n\nC.\n\nPhases of the JJ Array\n\nThe three phases of the JJ array can be described in\nterms of phase slips. The simplest is the normal phase\n(NOR), in which phase slips proliferate, and phase coherence is lost. In the SC \u22c6 phase, phase-slips and antiphase-slips bind into (neutral) dipoles and the chain becomes globally superconducting although the phase fluctuations on each grain are large enough that the local\nphase is no longer well defined and the dipoles still proliferate. The phase fluctuations are strong enough that\nthere is no quasi long-range order of the phase. Nevertheless uniform supercurrent can flow unimpeded in the\nchain.\nIn the fully superconducting phase (FSC), the phase\nslip dipoles bind into quadrupoles and annihilate at low\nenergy scales: the phase differences on each junctions are\nthen well defined, there is quasi long-range order, and\nthe chain is locally, as well as globally, superconducting.\nWe first study these phases and the phase transitions\nbetween them via a renormalization group analysis of\nthe sine-Gordon representation of the QPS action.\nThe two superconducting phases were discussed before, and were dubbed respectively [42, 43, 45, 46]. The\nphase diagram of the RSJJ chain for r = 0 was discussed\nby Chakravarty et al. [28] using the self-consistent harmonic approximation to treat the model of Eq. (12).\nWhile this analysis is appealing due to its simplicity, it\nmisses an important distinction between the two distinct\nsuperconducting phases. A contemporary publication by\nKorshunov [42, 43], analyzed the Dyson equation of the\nsine-Gordon representation Eq.(48) and found the two\nsuperconducting phases, dubbing them SC-1 and SC-2\n. Unfortunately, this approach was not very transparent and does not give a simple physical picture of the\nsuperconductor-to-normal transition. Fazio et al. [46]\nobtained a similar phase diagram to Korshunov via numerical calculations. In all these papers only the r = 0\ncase was considered. In this paper we analyze the model\nof Eq. (12) for general r and provide further insight into\nthe nature of the superconductor-to-normal transitions.\n\n\f17\nFor the case r = 0, we reproduce a phase diagram derived\nby Korshunov in Refs. 42, 43. We should emphasize that\nour RG analysis is the first to allow an investigation of\nboth phase boundaries and critical phenomena in the entire phase diagram (with the exception of intermediate\nJosephson strength, where, to date, no analytical method\napplies). Having the RG framework allows, for the first\ntime, to discuss both finite size and finite temperature\neffects of the dissipative JJ chain.\nD.\n\nRenormalization Group Flows for Strong\nJosephson Coupling\n\nAs we showed above, in the limit of strong Josephson\ncoupling the RSJJ chain of Fig. 1(c) can be described by\na spatially discrete sine-Gordon model\nZ\nZ = D[\u03b8]D[\u03c8]e\u2212Sdual [\u03b8,\u03c8]\u2212Sdipole [\u03b8,\u03c8] .\n(52)\n\nWe now derive and analyze the RG flow equations in\nthis strong Josephson coupling limit, treating the QPS\nfugacities as small, but at the same time allowing any\nvalues of the shunt and conversion resistances.\nThe flows of the anisotropic RG we use, are produced in\nthe sine-Gordon representation by integrating over high\nfrequency modes, \u03b8> and \u03c8 > , in a frequency shell, \u03a9 \u2212\nd\u03a9 < |\u03c9| < \u03a9, of \u03b8i (\u03c4 ) and \u03c8\u0001i (\u03c4 ), and then rescaling the\ntime as \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 \u2032 = 1 \u2212 d\u03a9\n\u03a9 \u03c4 so that \u03a9 returns to its\noriginal value, and the differential flow parameter is\n\nd\u03a9\n.\n(53)\n\u03a9\nBut, crucially, lengths are not rescaled and the spatial\ndiscreteness is kept. In doing this, however, there appears a characteristic length scale, \u039b(\u03a9), that plays an\nimportant role because of the anisotropic RG procedure:\nin terms of the (renormalized) phase velocity, c, which\ngrows under renormalization because of the rescaling of\ntime this is\nc\n.\n(54)\n\u039b=\na\u03a9\nAppendix 5.B of Ref. 80 describes in detail the derivation of the RG-flow equations perturbatively in powers\nof the fugacities; we will need these up to second order.\nIntegrating out the fast modes, effectively increases the\nshort time cut-off scale from \u03c40 to \u03c40 +d\u03c40 = \u03c40 (1+d\u03a9/\u03a9)\nso that part of the phase slip action is absorbed into\nits core yielding a linear suppression of the phase-slip\nfugacities, But there is also an increase in the fugacities\nfrom rescaling time as they represent the rate of phase\nslips. Combining these two effects we get:\n\u0010\nh\n\u0011i\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 12 K \u2212 \u03b1 ,\n\u03b6 \u2192 \u03b6 1 + d\u03a9\n\u03a9\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\b\ns\n\u2212sa/\u039b\n)\n\u03b7s \u2192 \u03b7s 1 + d\u03a9\n\u03a9 1 \u2212 2\u03b1(1 \u2212 w ) \u2212 K(1 \u2212 e\n(55)\n\u221a\nwhere K = \u03baJ.\ndl \u2261\n\nThe effective dissipation for the s-dipoles is\n2\u03b1(1 \u2212 ws ) ,\n\n(56)\n\nwhich can be seen to be the inverse of the shunt resistance\nfor the pair of (here parallel) Josephson junctions that\ncouple a row of s grains to the rest of the chain, as derived\nin Sec. II B. As it is necessary to treat the smallest\ndipoles, s = 1, specially, we define\n\u03b2 \u2261 2\u03b1(1 \u2212 w) .\n\n(57)\n\nThe K dependent term in the renormalization of \u03b7s requires some explanation. For dipoles with large s, the two\nconstituent QPS will be separately renormalized by the\nphase fluctuations that have been integrated out: thus\nthe factor proportional to K in this limit. In terms of\nthe circuit analysis, this dissipation can be thought of as\narising from the frequency \u03a9 plasmons that propagate\nfrom the two opposite phase slips before annihilating far\naway. In contrast, dipoles with small s will couple only\nweakly to the low energy phase modes and thus K has little effect on their renormalization. The energy-dependent\nlength scale \u039b separates these two regimes.\nIn principle, there should also be energy-scale dependence of the renormalization of \u03b6, but this can be ignored\nas long as \u039b is substantially larger than a. We will assume this henceforth at the cost of ignoring only initial\ntransient renormalizations (which will in any case only be\npart of the other relatively high energy scale processes we\nhave ignored).\nNonlinear contributions to the renormalization of \u03b6\nand the {\u03b7s } come from second order processes. One\nsuch process is the combining of two phase-slips of opposite signs into a dipole. The two phase-slips have to occur\non at almost the same time (within \u03c40 of each-other) on\nJosephson-junctions separated by s grains. This process\ngives a renormalization of \u03b7s\n\u0011\nd\u03a9 \u0010\n(58)\n\u03b7s \u2192 \u03b7s + \u03b6 2\n\u03c40 2\u03b1ws + Ke\u2212sa/\u039b ;\n\u03a9\nagain note the s dependence of the K term: the dipoles\nare only formed with appreciable amplitude when the\nspacing between them is less than \u039b; for convenience we\ndefine the factor\nu(l) \u2261 e\u2212a/\u039b\n\n(59)\n\nby analogy with w.\nA dipole can combine with a phase-slip on one of the\njunctions of the dipole to form a phase slip on the other\njunction. This adds second order contributions to \u03b6, for\neach s:\n\u03b6 \u2192 \u03b6 + \u03b6\u03b7s\n\nd\u03a9\n\u03c40 [2\u03b1(1 \u2212 ws ) + K(1 \u2212 us )] .\n\u03a9\n\n(60)\n\nTwo overlapping dipoles can combine to make a single\ndipole with moment the sum of the constituent moments.\nThis yields\n\n\f18\n\n\u03b7s \u2192 \u03b7s +\n\nh\ni\nd\u03a9 1 X\n\u03b7|\u03c3| \u03b7|s\u2212\u03c3| 2\u03b1(1 + ws \u2212 w|\u03c3| \u2212 w|s\u2212\u03c3| ) + K(1 + us \u2212 u|\u03c3| \u2212 u|s\u2212\u03c3| ) ,\n\u03a9 2 \u03c3\n\nwhere the sum runs over all \u03c3 to take into the account\nboth relative orientations of the dipoles.\nAnother important contribution comes from combining two phase-slips of opposite signs on the same pair\nof Josephson junctions with a small delay between them\n[1/\u2206\u03c4 > \u03a9(1 \u2212 d\u03a9/\u03a9)]. Their polarization gives rise to a\nrenormalization of the parameter J, which is related to\nthe superconducting stiffness of the Josephson junctions.\nThis yields a contribution to the quadratic action:\n1 2 2\n\u03c4 \u03b6\n4 0\n\nXZ\ni\n\nd\u03c4\n\nd\u03a9 2 \u221a\n\u03c4 J\u03ba\n\u03a9 0\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202\u03b8i ( \u03c4 )\n\u2202\u03c4\n\n\u00132\n\n.\n\ndJ\ndl\n\n(62)\n\n(61)\n\nIn addition, the rescaling of imaginary time - but not\nspace - leads to a rescaling of the parameters, \u03ba \u2192\n\u03ba (1 \u2212 d\u03a9/\u03a9), and J \u2192 J (1 + d\u03a9/\u03a9) which is reflected\nin the renormalization of the velocity c\u221aand hence \u039b \u221d c;\nat linear order in the fugacities, K = \u03baJ is not renormalized.\n\nThe differential RG flow equations for J, \u03b6, and {\u03b7s }\ncan now be obtained by combining the terms from Eqs.\n(55, 58, 60, 61, 62)\n\n= J \u2212 \u03c02 J 5/2 \u03ba1/2 \u03b6 2 \u03c402 ,\nd\u03ba\ndl\n\nd\u03b6\ndl\nd\u03b7s\ndl\n\n= \u2212\u03ba,\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u221a\nP\n= \u03b6 1 \u2212 12 \u03baJ \u2212 \u03b1 + 2\u03b6\n\u03b7s \u03c40 \u03b1(1 \u2212 ws ),\ns>0\n\nh\n\u221a i\n= \u03b7s [1 \u2212 2\u03b1(1 \u2212 ws )] + \u03b6 2 \u03c40 2\u03b1ws + \u03baJ +\n\nvalid in the limit of small fugacities \u03b6 and \u03b7s and for low\nenergy scales.

PHASE DIAGRAM AND PHASE\nTRANSITIONS FOR STRONG JOSEPHSON\nCOUPLING\n\nEquation (48), the action for phase slips, allows a complete description of the phase diagram in the strong coupling limit and controlled expansions in the vicinity of\nthe phase transitions for some ranges of parameters.\nWhen the fugacity of individual QPS, \u03b6, is relevant,\nthe superconductivity should break down completely and\nthe chain exhibit normal behavior. As \u03b6 grows, it will\nalso induce phase slip dipoles. If \u03b6 is irrelevant, on the\n\n1\n2\n\nP\n|\u03c3|\n\n(63)\n\n\u03b7\u03c3 \u03b7|s\u2212\u03c3| 2\u03b1(1 + ws \u2212 w|\u03c3| \u2212 w|s\u2212\u03c3| ),\n\nother hand, the chain should - at least naively - be superconducting, but which superconducting phase obtains\ndepends on the behavior of the dipoles.\nThe simplest phase in the strong coupling limit is the\nfully superconducting phase (FSC). In this phase, the\nfugacities {\u03b7s } and \u03b6 are all irrelevant about the Gaussian fixed line of the sine-Gordon model, Eq. (48), which\nthus controls the low energy behavior of the FSC phase.\nNot only will phase-slips occur only in tightly bound\npairs that will not be apparent at low energy scales, but\nphase slip dipoles will bind into quadrupoles, and isolated\ndipoles will not be evident at low energies.\nWhen both \u03b6 and the \u03b71 - the smallest dipoles that\nare least costly - are relevant, they will grow, inducing\nthe other {\u03b7s } to grow as well, until the small fugacity\nexpansion breaks down. Below this scale, there will be\nfree QPS's and no superconductivity: the resulting normal phase is best studied from the weak coupling limit\nas we do in the next section, Sec.

The three phase boundaries between the\nFSC, SC\u22c6 , and NOR can be local, global or mixed. They are marked as following: (G) marks global (solid line), (L) - local\n(dashed-dotted line), and (M) marks mixed (dashed lines). The FSC-NOR transition is partially local (ML) and global (MG)\nas marked in the figure. The meeting point where the FSC-NOR boundary changes its nature is a bi-critical point marked by\nthe gray dot. The open dot Marks the meeting of the three phase boundaries, and is a multi-critical point. Black dots mark\nwhere superconductivity breaks down in the limit of K \u2192 0. Note that the phase diagram in the vicinity of the sharp corners\n(bicritical points) may not be exactly correct due to large renormalizations of K which we otherwise neglect. These regions may\ngive rise to quite complicated multi-critical behavior. The critical behavior in the vicinity of the bicritical and multi-critical\npoints is richer than near the other phase boundaries, and is characterized by very long crossovers.\n\n\f20\nobtains. In this phase we can ignore the ohmic dissipation and therefore also the dipoles as separate objects: the proliferated dipoles essentially render the conversion resistance r infinite. Once dipoles proliferate,\nthe SC\u22c6 phase may still be unstable to single QPS. An\ninstability to \u03b6 once dipoles are proliferated drives the\nSC\u22c6 phase to the NOR phase, but this stability must be\nconsidered differently.\nThe qualitative discussion above gives rise to the main\nfeatures of the phase diagram of Fig. 7: the exception\nbeing the weak-coupling section of the mixed transition\nthat occurs for small K and small R; this we discuss in\nthe next section, Sec. V.\nThe relevance of \u03b6 or \u03b71 about the FSC limit triggers\nthe phase transitions from this phase to the normal and\nSC\u22c6 phases as well as controlling the bicritical point at\nwhich the mixed phase transition changes character. In\nthe limit of very strong coupling, the locations of the\nphase boundaries are given by the vanishing of the linear\neigenvalues of \u03b6 and \u03b71 .\nThe SC\u22c6 -normal phase boundary can be understood\nstraightforwardly from the SC\u22c6 phase (in which dipoles\nhave proliferated) purely in terms of individual QPS.\nThis transition is triggered by relevance of \u03b6. Its location, however, cannot be precisely obtained in terms of\nthe original parameters, even in the limit of strong coupling, because of the effects of the proliferation of dipoles.\nA.\n\n\u22c6\n\nFSC- SC phase transition [line (L)]\n\nIn both the FSC and SC\u22c6 phases single phase slips\nare irrelevant. Therefore, to determine the transition between the FSC and the SC\u22c6 phase we need to know when\n\u03b71 (the least costly dipole) changes from irrelevant to relevant about the Gaussian fixed line. The primary role of\nthe non-linear RG flows for these purposes, is the generation of {\u03b7s } from \u03b6 2 in Eq. (63) so that these will\nappear and must be considered even when they are absent initially. [Note, however, that the scale at which\n\u03b71 becomes important is determined by the \u03b6 2 term so\nthese second order terms can be crucial for understanding\nfinite-temperature and other crossovers.]\nThe first order terms of Eq. (63) for the flow of \u03b71 :\nd\u03b71\n\u2248 \u03b71 (1 \u2212 \u03b2)\ndl\n\n(64)\n\ncontrol the behavior near this transition. In the limit of\ninfinite coupling they yield a boundary line between the\nFSC and the SC\u22c6 phases:\n\u03b2L\u221e = 2\u03b1 (1 \u2212 w) = 1,\n\n(65)\n\nwhich is thus a condition on the critical resistances, e.g.\n\u221e\nRL\n(r) for this local transition. The quantitative superfluid properties drop out as is the case for individual junc-\n\ntions. As we shall see, for strong but finite coupling, the\nsituation with a chain of junctions is more complicated.\nWhen \u03b71 is irrelevant about the Gaussian fixed manifold, one must investigate whether there is a critical value\nof the fugacities above which \u03b71 grows. For \u03b2 close to\nunity, an expansion in the fugacities is still possible. The\ncrucial terms are the creation of \u03b72 by \u03b71 and the feedback of \u03b72 on \u03b71 . The structure is\nd\u03b71\n\u2248 \u03b71 (1 \u2212 \u03b2) + C112 \u03b71 \u03b72\ndl\n\n(66)\n\n\u0001\nd\u03b72\n\u2248 \u03b72 1 \u2212 2\u03b1[1 \u2212 w2 ] + C211 \u03b712\n(67)\ndl\nwith the Cs coefficients. Since the (linear) eigenvalue of\n\u03b72 is negative, there is a critical fixed point for \u03b2 > 1 at\np\n\u03b71\u2217 \u223c \u03b2 \u2212 1 and \u03b72\u2217 \u223c \u03b2 \u2212 1 .\n(68)\n\nIt can be seen that the higher moment dipoles have corresponding fixed point values\n\u03b7s\u2217 \u223c (\u03b2 \u2212 1)s/2\n\n(69)\n\nand can thus be neglected to leading order in \u03b2 \u22121. Since\n\u03b71 will be of order the bare \u03b6 2 after the brief initial tran\u221e\nsients, we see that for RL\n\u2212 R small but positive, there\nwill be a critical value of \u03b6 for the local transition\n1\n\n\u221e\n\u03b6L \u223c (RL\n\u2212 R) 4\n\n(70)\n\nusing, for convenience, R as the control parameter; with\nr varying instead, the behavior is similar only with a\ndifferent coefficient.\nJust above the critical fugacity, the crossover energy\nscale below which the chain will no longer appear critical\ngoes to zero near the critical point as\nE\u00d7 \u223c |\u03b6 \u2212 \u03b6L |\u03bc .\n\n(71)\n\nThe critical exponent \u03bc varies continuously with the resistive parameters. For \u03b2 \u2212 1 small,\n\u03bc\u2248\n\n1\n.\n2(\u03b2 \u2212 1)\n\n(72)\n\nBecause this transition is essentially local - with dynamic scaling exponent z = \u221e - the diverging length\nscales can be subtle. But there should be some crossover\nin the spatial correlations at a length scale\n\u03be \u223c c/E\u00d7\n\n(73)\n\nbeyond which the superconducting correlations behave\nsomewhat differently.\nFor this discussion, we have not been careful about\nwhere the RG flows go when the dipoles proliferate. If\nthey go to the SC\u22c6 phase, the above obtains. But it is\nalso possible that they go near the SC\u22c6 regime only to\nflow away at lower energies if \u03b6 is relevant. In this latter\ncase, the transition will be from the FSC directly to the\nnormal phase, as we discuss below. But we first consider\nthe effects of dipole proliferation.\n\n\f21\nB.\n\nSC\u22c6 phase and screening of dissipative\ninteractions\n\nIn the region of parameter space where \u03b71 is relevant,\nthe simple perturbative RG flow, Eqs. (63), breaks down,\nand phase-slip dipoles proliferate. But this is not in itself\nsufficient to destroy superconductivity; the lead-to-lead\ncoherence can persist as long as the quantum phase slips\nremain bound in pairs. [58, 83] Dipoles do, however, allow the phase of a single grain to jump by 2\u03c0 relative\nto its neighbors. This is the SC\u22c6 in which each grain no\nlonger has a well defined phase. But the global superconductivity survives as long as \u03b6 is irrelevant about the\nfixed line that controls the SC\u22c6 phase.\nIn the SC\u22c6 phase, the dissipation no longer plays an\nessential role. This can be most easily seen by comparing\nthe dipole term with the quadratic parts of the action for\nthe \u03c8 field in the Sine-Gordon action. At low energies,\nthe fluctuations of the field \u03b8 are small enough that one\ncan ignore the \u03b8j+1 \u2212 \u03b8j in the dipole term and approxi-\n\nmate it by\n\u03b71 cos[\u03c8j+1 \u2212 \u03c8j ] .\n\n(74)\n\nWhen \u03b71 becomes of order \u03a9, the highest remaining frequency, the dipole term is comparable to the R|\u03c9||\u03c8j (\u03c9)|2\nand the r|\u03c9||\u03c8j+1 (\u03c9) \u2212 \u03c8j (\u03c9)|2 term at frequencies of order \u03a9. [If r \u226a R the comparison is somewhat more\nsubtle.]\nBelow this crossover frequency, the dipole term\nstrongly suppresses fluctuations of neighboring \u03c8j at low\nfrequencies: together with the R|\u03c9||\u03c8j (\u03c9)|2 term, it cuts\noff the divergent fluctuations of \u03c8 while \u03b8 continues to\nfluctuate similarly to in the absence of the dipoles. At\nthis point, we can take the continuum limit without\nworry, replace the lattice with a high-momentum cutoff\nand expand out the dipole terms (analogous to treating\nscreening in a metal as if by continuous charges - the\nDebye-H\u00fcckel approximation) as\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0012\n\u0013\u00132\n\u0012 \u0014\n\u03b7\n\u2202\u03c8(x, \u03c4 ) \u2202\u03b8(x, \u03c4 )\n\u2202\u03c8(x, \u03c4 ) \u2202\u03b8(x, \u03c4 )\n\u22121 \u2248\u2212\na\n.\n+\n+\n\u03b7 cos a\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n2\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\u0012\n\nAn approximate action for the SC\u22c6 phase is then\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0001\nR dk n\u0010 2 1\nR\n\u03c92\nk 2\u03c0\u03ba + a2 \u03b7 + 2\u03c0J\n\u03b82 + a2 \u03b7k 2 +\nS = d\u03c9\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\nPR\nd\u03c4 \u03b6 cos (\u03b8i (\u03c4 ) + \u03c8i (\u03c4 ))\n\u2212\n\n\u03bbQ\n2\u03c0\u03b1 |\u03c9|\n\n\u0010\nk2 +\n\n1\n\u03bb2Q\n\n\u0011\u0011\n\n\u03c82\n\no\n\n(75)\n\n(76)\n\ni\n\nWhere we have neglected \u03b8 \u2212 \u03c8 cross-terms proportional\nto k 2 . These do not contribute to or alter the singular interaction between phase slips in this regime. Note\nthat the plasmon part of the interaction (the \u03b82 part)\nhas been renormalized by the phase-slip dipoles, but it\nis not screened, i.e., it still vanishes at \u03c9 = k = 0.\nThe dissipative part, however, does get screened reducing the dissipative interaction between phase slips to\n\u03bbQ\nSdiss (x, \u03c4 ) \u221d 1/\u03c4 2 when |\u03c4 | \u226b 4\u03c0\u03b1\u03b7a\n. This should be\ncompared with Eq. (42). Because of the finite screening\ntime of the dissipative interaction between phase slips,\nthis does not play a role for the asymptotic behavior of\neither the SC\u22c6 phase, or the SC\u22c6 to normal transition.\nThe screening of the dissipative interaction by dipoles\ncan be understood simply by circuit methods (Sec. II B)\nor by considering the phase-slips as a Coulomb gas. It\nplays a crucial role for finite JJ chains for which the effects of dissipation are not completely eliminated. This\nwill be discussed in a future publication [70].\nIf the system flows to the SC\u22c6 fixed line when the dipole\nfugacity grows, then the critical behavior of the FSC-\n\nSC\u22c6 transition is that found in the previous subsection.\nBefore returning to the trickier question of what happens\nwhen the flows eventually go away from the SC\u22c6 regime,\nwe briefly discuss the direct SC\u22c6 -NOR transition.\nC.\n\nSC\u22c6 - Normal transition [line (G)]\n\nOnce dissipation has been eliminated, we are left with\na simple low-energy effective action for the SC\u22c6 phase:\nthe standard chain of grains with self capacitance and\nconnected by Josephson junctions.

(77) is most naturally studied by an\nisotropic RG rescaling both x and \u03c4 , and integrating out\n\n\f22\nthe modes of \u03b8 that have large \u03c9 or large k. By carrying\nout the RG flow in p\nx and \u03c4 directions, the usual K-T RG\nequations for K = \u03ba\u0303J \u0303 and \u03b6 obtain [84]:\ndK\ndl\nd\u03b6\ndl\n\n= \u2212 \u03c02 K 2 \u03c402 \u03b6 2\n\u0001\n=\u03b6 2\u2212 K\n2 .\n\n(78)\n\nThe SC\u22c6 -normal phase boundary - a global transition\n- thus occurs for \u03b6 \u226a 1 at\nKG = 4 + O(\u03b6).\n\n(79)\n\nWhen the initial \u03b6 is not small, the critical value of K will\nbe increased both by the direct effects of \u03b6 and also via its\ngeneration of dipoles ({\u03b7s }) and their later modification\nof \u03ba at intermediate scales as in Eq. (76).\nIn the normal phase near this global transition, the\ncharacteristic time\u221aand length scales both diverge exponentially as exp[1/ KG \u2212 K] - and similarly in R \u2212 RG\nwhen dissipation plays a role at intermediate scales and\ncan control the transition. This contrasts with the power\nlaw divergences near the FSC-SC\u22c6 local transition.\nAlthough we have here used the conventional isotropic\nRG to study the SC\u22c6 - normal transition, it is important\nto understand whether the anisotropic RG we use in the\nrest of this paper can reproduce the KT results in the\nappropriate regime. We address this issue below in Sec.\nIV H.\n\nD.\n\nFSC - Normal transition [line (M)]\n\nWe now turn to the most subtle transition: the mixedcharacter transition from the FSC to the normal phase.\nAs the phase slip fugacity is increased, the superconducting stiffness, K, is reduced, or the resistances increased,\na quantum phase transition between the FSC phase and\nthe normal phase of the chain can occur directly without\nan intermediate SC\u22c6 phase. This mixed transition can\nbe driven by two distinct mechanisms even in the strong\ncoupling limit in which the Sine-Gordon description is\nuseful. If single QPS's become relevant when dipoles are\nstill irrelevant about the FSC fixed line, they will drive\nthe transition inducing proliferation of both dipoles and\nisolated QPS as the fugacity \u03b6 grows.\nBut if small dipoles become relevant when single QPS\nare still irrelevant about the FSC fixed manifold, it is\nnevertheless still possible for the dipole-driven transition\nto be between the FSC and normal phases. This occurs\nif the flow towards the SC\u22c6 phase from the proliferating\ndipoles is interrupted by the relevance of individual QPS\nabout the SC\u22c6 fixed line. We first discuss the latter case.\n\nE.\n\nDipole driven mixed transition [line (ML)]\n\nThe RG flows for this dipole driven transition are\nsomewhat complicated. As shown earlier, if the QPS\nfugacity is irrelevant about the FSC fixed manifold when\nthe dipole fugacities start growing - such as when the\nbare fugacity, \u03b6, is above a critical value - \u03b6 will continue to decrease until the effects of the dipoles are strong\nenough to change its flow. Crudely, this will happen when\nthe \u03b7s \u03b6 terms in Eq. (63) become large enough to dominate over the ( 12 K + \u03b1 \u2212 1)\u03b6 term. As this will happen\nwhen some of the {\u03b7s } are of order the energy scale \u03a9, say\nat energy scale E\u00d7 , the system will soon after approach\nthe SC\u22c6 fixed line as discussed in Sec. IV A (other operators neglected perturbatively will also become important\non these scales). But by this point, if the system is close\nenough to critical, \u03b6 will have become extremely small.\nThus even when it is relevant about the SC\u22c6 fixed line\nand hence will turn around are grow on scales smaller\nthan E\u00d7 , \u03b6 will not become large enough to make individual QPS proliferate, until a much lower energy scale,\nEN < E\u00d7 .\nPhysical properties should exhibit both of the energy\nscales just beyond the FSC-normal transition: At high\nenergies, the system will appear critical - FSC-SC\u22c6 critical - at intermediate energies, EN \u226a E \u226a E\u00d7 , it will\nappear to be in the SC\u22c6 phase - albeit with a phase stiffness that is too low to sustain superconductivity at long\nscales - and at asymptotically low energies, E \u226a EN ,\nnormal behavior will obtain. This behavior is characteristic of a dangerously irrelevant operator - in this case\n\u03b6 - about the critical fixed point. The energy scale EN\nwill go to zero as a power of the distance from criticality,\nbut its exponent will be larger than that of E\u00d7 by an\namount controlled by both the flow of \u03b6 towards the FSC\nfixed manifold, and its flow away from the SC\u22c6 fixed line,\nas well as the flow of \u03b71 away from the critical fixed point.\nThe behavior of the length scales will be similarly complicated and the dynamic critical exponent relating EN\nto the superconducting correlation length, will be larger\nthan unity.\n\nF.\n\nQPS driven mixed transition [line (MG)]\n\nIn the regime in which the FSC-normal transition is\ndriven by QPS - the fundamental topological excitations - the phase boundary and nature of the transition\ncan be studied from Eqs. (63) for the flow of \u03b6. For this\ntransition, the dipoles play only a secondary role.\nIn the region near the FSC fixed manifold, the perturbative RG equations (63) are valid and, in the regime of\ninterest, the {\u03b7s } are renormalized to zero and can be\nignored. We thus need only the first two RG flow Eqs.\n(63). Working in units of the cutoff energy scale \u03a9 and\n\n\f23\nlength scale a, we have:\ndJ\ndl\n\nd\u03b6\ndl\n\n5\n\n1\n\n\u2248 J \u2212 \u03c02 J 2 \u03ba 2 \u03c402 \u03b6 2 ,\n\nd\u03ba\ndl \u2248 \u2212\u03ba,\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u221a\n\u2248 \u03b6 1 \u2212 12 \u03baJ \u2212 \u03b1 ,\n\n(80)\n\nEquations (80) are similar to the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) flow equations, except for the anisotropic scaling of \u03ba\nand J. We first proceed naively and transform to variables in which the flows appear more isotropic, defining:\n\u03ba = \u03bael ,\nJ = Je\u2212l ,\n\n(81)\n\n1\n2l\n\n\u03b6 = \u03b6e .\nwhereby Eqs.

In the FSC phase\nz flows to zero whereas in the normal phase z diverges\nand K flows to zero. The critical line separating the two\nphases is thus\nxM \u2248 \u2212z,\n\n(85)\n\nWhen \u03b6 \u226a 1 the FSC-normal phase boundary in Eq.\n(85), x \u2248 0, translates to\nKM = 3 \u2212 2\u03b1.\n\n(86)\n\nAlthough the phase boundary of Eq. (86) is correct for\nthe renormalized K, for non-zero initial QPS fugacity\n\u03b6, the critical value of K will be slightly larger - by\nO(\u03b6 2 ) when the bare fugacity is small - because of the\nrenormalizations of Eqs. (82).\nOn the normal side of the transition, the behavior is\nsubtle. The subtlety arises because the transformation\nbetween \u03b6 and \u03b6 (Eq. 83 and 82 ) involves the scale of\nthe RG explicitly: \u03b6 \u221d e\u2212l/2 \u03b6 \u221d e\u2212l/2 z, so that \u03b6 may\n\ndecrease even though z is formally relevant. But as z\ngrows to the order unity, it will substantially decrease x,\nconcomitantly, J, and hence the further growth rate of \u03b6\nfrom Eq. (81). The growth rate of \u03b6 will then become\nrapid enough to overcome the e\u2212l/2 factor and make \u03b6\ngrow as well. Thus after initially decreasing because of\nthe factor e\u2212l/2 , \u03b6 eventually turns around and then becomes large (at not much lower energies) at which point\nthe behavior will be characteristic of the normal phase.\nThe dipole fugacities, {\u03b7s }, will be small as long as \u03b6\nis, but when \u03b6 becomes large, they will grow (for large s\nas well as small). This implies that Josephson junctions\nare no longer independent of each other, and phase slips\nbecome spread-out over several junctions. In principle, at\nthis stage we could switch to carrying out the RG isotropically, but by then other higher order processes will also\ncome in and expansions in powers of the fugacities break\ndown.\nThe critical behavior near this QPS driven mixed transition will be similar to near a conventional KosterlitzThouless transition, with, for example, energy scale, E\u00d7 ,\nvanishing exponentially in the inverse square root of the\ndistance from criticality. The corresponding exponent\nis \u03bc = \u221e in contrast to the finite but variable \u03bc that\ncharacterizes the dipole driven mixed transition. Associated with the E\u00d7 will be one or more diverging length\nscales. There should be a scale that grows as 1/E\u00d7 corresponding to dynamical exponent z = 1, but there may\nbe a second scale associated with the onset of substantial\nscreening of \u03ba and spatially (rather than temporally) separated QPS that will occur only after the dipoles come\ninto play. We will not explore this issue further here.\nTo make the above analysis solid, It is essential to\nshow that the perturbative RG equations on which it\nis based are valid out to scales at which K(l) starts\nto decrease significantly from the screening by pairs of\nQPS. The rescaling from \u03b6 to \u03b6 was chosen to make these\nrenormalizations, as in Eq. (82), small if and only if \u03b6\nremains small. This could better (but equivalently to\nthe needed\norder) have been done by defining instead\n\u221a\n\u03b6\u0303 = J\u03b6 thereby making\u221ad log J/dl depend only on the\ncombinations\np \u03b6\u0303 and K = J\u03ba: the latter (in contrast to,\ne.g. c = J/\u03ba) is of order unity in the regime of interest near the transition. With this choice, it means that\nthe dipole fugacities, {\u03b7s }, are induced by (\u03b6\u0303)2 /J which\ndecreases rapidly after the initial transients that create\nsmall dipoles. Thus the {\u03b7s } should not be problematic\nas they will be decreasing and only give rise to relative\nchanges: terms of order \u03b6\u03b7s .\nThe primary potential problems are additional renormalizations of J (or \u03ba) that are not small when \u03b6\u0303 is small.\nThese can arise, for example, by the combination of a\ntripole - a QPS \"dressed\" by a nearby small dipole -\nand an opposite sign QPS. Such terms are equivalent to\nterms of order \u03b6\u0303 4 in other RG schemes, but these, and\nother terms higher order than quadratic, do not occur\n\n\f24\ndirectly with the RG scheme we use: they are generated\nfrom other operators as in this case. This has the advantage of making a cataloging of all operators and how\nthey renormalize each other linearly and quadratically,\nequivalent to \"all orders\" arguments in other perturbative RGs. One can readily show that the generation of\ntripoles from a dipole and a QPS, and the subsequent\nrenormalization of the tripole fugacities by dissipation\nplus the stiffness K, will result in effects of the tripoles\nback to \u03b6\u0303 and to J that decay with energy scale while \u03b6\u0303\n(and equivalently z) is decreasing. Further analysis along\nthese lines shows that indeed, the result for the critical\nKM , Eq. (86) is correct. What is rather surprising, is\nthat this arises from a basic (power-counting-like) renormalization of \u03b6 that is midway between the '1' for purely\ntemporal rescaling, and the '2' for space-time rescaling.\nBy showing that the RG remains controlled out to\nthis stage, we have verified that the FSC-normal phase\nboundary is in one regime indeed given by Eq. (86) in the\nlimit of small fugacities; more generally the location of\nthe transition will be exactly K = 3 \u2212 2\u03b1 if the renormalized - and hence measurable - low energy parameters,\nK and \u03b1, are used.\nNevertheless, near the phase boundary on the normal\nside, the fact that \u03b6 first flows toward zero and only at a\nlater stage becomes large, gives rise to a crossover in the\nresistance vs. temperature. From the last of Eqs. (80)\nwe see that this will occur as long as\nK > 2 \u2212 2\u03b1.\nThus the crossover occurs in the range of parameters\n2 \u2212 2\u03b1 < K < 3 \u2212 2\u03b1 ;\n\n(87)\n\nthe physical consequences and origin of this region is discussed in Secs. VII and II B.\n\nG.\n\nFSC-Normal bicritical point\n\nAs shown above in Secs. IV E and IV F, the FSCnormal transition can have one of two distinct characters: either a dipole driven transition with power-law\nsingularities [line (ML) in Fig. 7], continuously variable\nexponents, and non-trivial relations between length and\ntime scales, or driven by single QPS, with exponentiallyrapidly decreasing energy scales and at least some space\nand time scales scaling similarly [line (MG)]. In the limit\nof small (bare) fugacities, the transition occurs where\nin the K, \u03b1, \u03b2 space the system is at intermediate energy scales. The two critical surfaces in this space meet\nalong a bicritical line, across which the critical behavior changes, although the phases on both sides are the\nsame. At non-zero fugacity, \u03b6, the behavior is similar\nwith the critical surfaces (actually now hypersurfaces)\n\nand location of the bicritical line (actually now a twodimensional manifold) changed. When the critical fugacity is small, as occurs when \u03b2 \u2212 1 (see Eq. 64) is small\n(and positive), the behavior near the bicritical line can\nbe treated perturbatively. If the multicritical manifold is\napproached along the dipole-driven critical manifold, the\nformer can be found by considering the eigenvalue of \u03b6\nat the point on the critical fixed manifold, parametrized\nperturbatively by \u03b71\u2217 . This eigenvalue will be increased\nby O(\u03b71\u2217 )2 from its value at the corresponding point on\nthe FSC fixed manifold (all {\u03b7s } zero). When the critical eigenvalue, rather than 1 \u2212 12 \u03ba \u2212 \u03b1 passes through\n\u2212 21 , the critical fixed manifold will become unstable to\nindividual QPS at low energies. This condition thus characterizes the multicritical manifold. For \u03b71 just below the\nbicritical manifold the flow will be to the FSC phase, but\nbecause of the initial effects of \u03b71 on \u03b6, will end up closer\nto critical than it would have been. Associated with the\nmulticriticality will be complicated crossover behaviors\nthat we will not explore.\n\nH.\n\nSC\u22c6 - Normal transition revisited\n\nIn the standard treatment of isotropic 2d, or 1+1, X-Y\nmodels, we use isotropic RG to obtain the K-T transition.\nThis is also the way in which we analyzed the Global (G)\nNOR-SC\u22c6 transition in Sec. IV C once dipoles are proliferated. As mentioned earlier, for consistency, we should\nbe able to analyze this global SC\u22c6 -normal transition by\nthe anisotropic RG we use in the rest of this paper. This\nalso serves to make a more convincing case for the peculiar behavior of the QPS driven FSC-normal transition.\nAnalyzing the global transition by the anisotropic RG is\npossible but clumsy; we only outline the basics here.\nIt is useful to first consider what modification there\nwould be to the small-fugacity flow equations if oppositesign QPS on different junctions could annihilate each\nother under renormalization rather than combining into\ndipoles. Because of factors of us = exp[\u2212a/\u039b] - similar to those in the generation of \u03b7s by \u03b6 2 in Eq. (63)\n- onlyp\nQPS pairs separated by less than or of order\n\u039b(l) = J/\u03ba/\u03a9 will be renormalized away. But this is\na factor of \u039b/a more combinations than were included\nfrom QPS pairs on the same junction: the renormalization of J of order \u03b6 2 will thus be larger by a similar factor.\nWe now recombine parameters similarly to what was in\nthe mixed case: to make the renormalizations of J small\nwhen \u03b6\u0303 is small and K\u221aof order unity. This now requires\n\u03b6\u0303 = J\u03b6 (contrast with J\u03b6 in the mixed case) which will\nchange the eigenvalue of \u03b6\u0303 to 2 \u2212 12 K \u2212 \u03b1 while keeping K\nmarginal. In the absence of dissipation, this would yield\na KT transition with critical value KG = 4 as obtained\nfrom the isotropic RG of Sec. IV C. What is not immediately clear, is at what point the flows have crossed over\ninto the normal regime and \u03b6 cos \u03b8j can be well approxi-\n\n\f25\nmated by \u03b6(1 \u2212 12 \u03b8j2 ) and the\n\nP\n\napproximated by\n\nj\n\n1\na\n\nR\n\ndx.\n\nThis can be checked by estimating the mean-square fluctuations of \u03b8j using the resulting quadratic continuum\nform. As at low energy scales 1/\u03ba is large and 1/J small,\nthis will be dominated by wave-vectors of order 1/\u039b or\nsmaller.\nThe remaining frequency integral will be cut off\n\u221a\nat \u03b6J and thus dominated by frequencies of order \u03a9\nwhen \u03b6\u0303 = \u03b6J/\u03a9 is of order unity as would be naively\nguessed from the rescaling that gave the KT flows.\nBut this is not the whole story. In addition to the\nrenormalizations of J, there should be similar (asymptotically) renormalizations of \u03ba which controls the spatial gradients of \u03b8. In the anisotropic RG, these arise\nfrom replacing the dipole operators in the absence of \u03c8,\ncos(\u03b8j+s \u2212 \u03b8j ), by 1 \u2212 2(\u03b8j+s \u2212 \u03b8j )2 \u2248 1 \u2212 2s2 a2 (\u2202x \u03b8)2 .\nThis is justified if \u03b8 is sufficiently slowly varying in space.\nWith the anisotropic cutoff, this is justified for s < \u039b\nas, because of the low frequency cutoff relative to the\nwave-vector dependence, h(\u03b8j+s \u2212 \u03b8j )2 i \u2248 2K|s|/\u039b in\nthis regime. Thus the renormalizations of 1/\u03ba to order\n\u03b6 2 are of the correct form. By summing over the appropriate range of s, their amplitude can be found to be of\norder \u03b6\u0303 2 \u039b which have the additional \u039b factor that compensates exactly for the linear growth of 1/\u03ba with the\ninverse of the energy scale in the anisotropic RG. Similarly, the argument in the previous paragraph for how\nJ is renormalized, can be justified by the replacement of\n(\u2202\u03c4 [\u03b8s+j + \u03b8j ])2 cos(\u03b8j+s \u2212 \u03b8j ) by 4(\u2202\u03c4 \u03b8 21 s+j )2 renormalizing 1/J.\nFor the SC\u22c6 - normal transition when the fugacities\nare small, the analysis above can only be done once the\ndipoles have been induced and proliferated enough to\nsuppress the fluctuations of \u03c8 and enable it to be neglected as in Sec. IV C . Again, the intermediate regime\nof the flows, where the {\u03b7s } are of order unity, cannot be\nhandled in a controlled manner. But this occurs over a\nsmall range of energy scales and thus will only result in\nfactors of order unity.\n\nV.\n\nWEAK JOSEPHSON COUPLING LIMIT\n\nIn this section we analyze the JJ chain when the\nJosephson interaction is weak: EJ \u226a EC . In this limit\nthe starting point is to assume there is no phase coherence\nbetween grains so that the currents between grains are\npredominantly normal. We can then consider Cooperpair-tunneling events perturbatively. In this limit the\nJosephson coupling is sufficiently weak that superconductivity can only be established if the dissipation is sufficiently strong to drive the system into the FSC phase:\nthe\np\nSC\u22c6 phase cannot occur as its stiffness K = 2\u03c0 EJ /EC\nis too small. We thus can explore only the dissipationdominated transition directly from the normal to the\nFSC phase: as both local and global superconducting\ncoherence are established by this transition, it has mixed\ncharacter. As discussed in Ref. 85, pair tunneling events\nare dual to quantum phase slips. Nevertheless, the treatment is substantially simpler than that of the mixed transition in the strong coupling limit analyzed in the previous section.\nA.\n\nPair-tunnel events\n\nThe basic objects that need to be considered are\nCooper pair-tunneling events between grains. Their action can be formulated in the Coulomb-gas representation. This allows the RG flows when pair-tunneling is\nrare to be worked out perturbatively.\nConsider first the Hamiltonian of a single capacitively\nshunted Josephson junction:\nHJJ =\n\n1 2\nQ\u0302 \u2212 EJ cos \u03c6.\n2C\n\nIn the weak coupling limit, the charge fluctuations will\nbe small relative to the phase fluctuations, and the junction can be described in terms of charge states with wave\nfunctions:\nq\n\n\u03a8(\u03c6) = ei 2e \u03c6 ,\n\nI.\n\nMulticritical point\n\nThe three phase boundaries, FSC-SC\u22c6 , SC\u22c6 -\nnormal, and FSC-normal come together at a multicritical point as shown in the schematic phase diagram, Fig.\n7. The behavior near this multicritical point involves an\ninterplay between the SC\u22c6 -like behavior when dipoles\nproliferate, and the FSC-like behavior when the dipole\nfugacities are small. How these come together at the\nmulticritical point is likely to involve flows in the intermediate coupling regime in which controlled calculations\nare beyond the scope of the methods of this paper.\n\n(88)\n\n(89)\n\nwhere q is the charge imbalance across the junction. The\ncosine term in the Hamiltonian thus induces hopping\nof Cooper-pairs, since ei\u03c6 is a translation operator that\nchanges the charge imbalance by 2e. We can describe\nthe normal-to-superconductor phase transition of a resistively shunted Josephson junction in term of pair-tunnel\nevents: when these are suppressed at low energies, the\njunction is well described by the charge state, Eq. (89),\nand is in the normal state. But when pair-tunnels proliferate, superconductivity is established and the phase\nbecomes the good quantum number. In this dual description, in opposition to that in terms of QPS, the\nquantum fluctuations are responsible for the superconductivity rather than destroying it.\n\n\f26\nR\n\na.\n\nR\n\nR\n\nr\n\nr\n\n2e\nb.\n\nR\n\nR\n\nR\n\n2e\n\nR\n\nR\n\nr\n\nr\n\nc.\n\n\u2212\n\nr\n\n\u2212\n\nR\n\n2e\n\n\u2212\n\nR\n\nR\n\nr\n\nr\n\nr\n\n2e\n\n\u2212\n\nFIG. 8: (a) Cooper pair tunneling event, between two neighboring grains (solid line): the basic process for weak Josephson\ncoupling. Charge relaxation is via the resistance 2r + R (dotted line). (b) Two nearly simultaneous pair-tunnels involving\na common grain: the current through the conversion resistance r of that grain cancels giving rise to an effective interaction\nbetween the two pair-tunnels. These two pair tunnels can renormalize into a pair-tunnel over two junctions (c).\n\nTo explore the pair-tunnel physics, we can start with\nthe action in terms of the superconducting phases, {\u03c6j },\nof the grains in the chain. This is given by Eq. (12).\nSince we are interested in the low energy dynamics on\n\nZ=\n\nZ\n\n\"\n\n1\nD[\u03c6i (\u03c4 )]exp \u2212\n2\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c9\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nsmall length scales, we take the limit of small \u03c9 of the\nquadratic parts of the action, keeping the spatial discreteness but dropping the O(\u03c9 2 \u03c62 ) charging energy. The partition function in this limit can be written in the form:\n\nX\n|\u03c9|RQ\ndk\n|\u2206(k, \u03c9)|2 +\nika\n\u2212ika\n2\u03c0 2\u03c0a (R + r (2 \u2212 e \u2212 e\n))\ni\n\nZ\n\n#\n\nd\u03c4 EJ cos (\u2206i (\u03c4 ))\n\n(90)\n\nor equivalently with a local part on each grain, and an exponentially decaying - with ws - interaction of opposite\nsign between phases on grains s apart that exactly cancels for the total interaction (i.e., vanishes at k = 0). This is\nbecause it is the phase differences across the junctions,\n\u2206i (\u03c4 ) = \u03c6i+1 (\u03c4 ) \u2212 \u03c6i (\u03c4 ).\n\n(91)\n\nthat enter here. Note that in the normal phase - the starting point here \u2013 it would be more proper to write the\nresistive part of the action in terms of d\u2206j /d\u03c4 which is proportional to the electrochemical potential differences across\nthe junctions as the phase variables are not defined modulo 2\u03c0. The absence of superconducting aspects other than\nthe cosine terms is because the quadratic action explicitly does not include the Josephson coupling. At low energies\nand when the capacitative interactions dominate, the densities of states parameters, DN and DS , drop out. Note that\nif there were no normal conduction across the junctions, i.e. R = 0, the quadratic action would separate into a sum\nover non-interacting grains.\nThe role of pair-tunneling events, and hence the superconducting behavior of the JJ chain, can be seen by carrying\nout an expansion of Eq. (90) in powers of EJ . The n'th order term corresponds to the probability weight of n\n\n\f27\npair-tunnels occurring in space-time. If the weight of the partition function (90) is concentrated in the term of 0'th\norder in EJ , it means that no superconductivity is taking place at T = 0, since pair-tunnel events are suppressed. On\nthe other hand, if the weight is concentrated on high order terms, pair-tunnel events proliferate - i.e., they happen\nfrequently - and the chain is superconducting.\nThe expansion in EJ leads to a Coulomb gas representation of the action of pair-tunnel events and the partition\nfunction:\n\"\n#\nN X\nN\nX\nX \u0012 EJ \u0013N X\u0303\nexp \u22121/2\n\u03c3m \u03c3n G(xm \u2212 xn , \u03c4m \u2212 \u03c4n ) ,\n(92)\nZ=\n\u03a9\nm=1 n=1\nN\n\n{\u03c3, x, \u03c4 }\n\nwhere {\u03c3 = \u00b11} are\nP the \"charges\" - i.e. signs - of the tunnels, the sum is over all distinguishable neutral\nconfigurations with\n\u03c3n = 0, and the interaction between tunnel events is\nn\n\nG(x, \u03c4 ) = \u22122q1 q2 log\n\n\u0012\n\n|\u03c4 |\n\u03c40\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\n\u0013\nr\nR + 2r\n\u03b4x, 0 \u2212\n(\u03b4x, a + \u03b4x, \u2212a ) ,\nRQ\nRQ\n\nwith \u03b4x1 , x2 the Kronecker \u03b4. The short time cutoff, \u03c40 \u223c\n(R + 2r)C/h\u0304 is now the time duration of a phase slip,\nessentially the RC relaxation time of a charge imbalance\nbetween two neighboring grains. This and other cutoffs\nfrom the high energy physics, we approximate by a UV\ncutoff \u03a90 = 1/\u03c40 . The tunneling fugacity we denote\n\u03be1 \u221d EJ ,\n\n(94)\n\nand it has units of frequency.\nThe distance dependence of the interaction Eq. (93)\nis easy to understand. If two pair-tunnel events happen through the same Josephson junction, the strength\nof the logarithmic interaction between them is 2 R+2r\nRQ the\ntotal resistance that the Cooper-pair has to go through\nin order to relax back to an equilibrium charge distribution (Fig. 8(a)) as found for a single shunted Josephson\njunction (see e.g. Ref. 58). If two pair-tunnels happen\non neighboring junctions, the Cooper-pair relaxation current overlaps on the common grain and thus involves the\nnormal-to-superfluid resistance within the grain, r (Fig.\n8(b)). This reduces the logarithmic interaction strength\nof 2 RrQ between neighboring tunnel-events. Events separated by more than one junction have independent relaxations and hence no interaction as in Eq. (93).\n\nZ=\n\nZ\n\n\"\n\n1\nD[\u03c6(\u03c4 )]exp \u2212\n2\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c9\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nn=0\n\nIf two tunneling events that involve a common grain\noccur close together in time, the charge changes of the\ncommon grain can cancel and the combination is equivalent to a single pair-tunneling between further separated\ngrains (see Fig. 8(c)). We denote by \u03ben the fugacity of\na pair-tunnel between grains separated by sa. Although\nin the original partition function, Eq. (92), \u03ben = 0 for\nn \u2265 2, the long range pair tunnels will be produced during the RG flow.\nThe strength of the mutual and self interaction of pairtunnel events will determine whether they proliferate and\ninduce superconductivity in the chain, or whether pairtunnels form bound pairs and annihilate each other, keeping the chain normal. For weak-Josephson-coupling, this\ncan be analyzed via a perturbative RG analysis in powers\nof the {\u03bes }.\n\nB.\n\nRG Flow of the pair-tunnel fugacities\n\nTo study the RG flows, it is easiest to go back to the\ninitial action in terms of the superconducting phase differences, \u2206j , between the junctions:\n\nX\n|\u03c9|aRQ\ndk\n2\n|\u2206(k, \u03c9n )| +\nika\n\u2212ika\n2\u03c0 2\u03c0 (R + r (2 \u2212 e \u2212 e\n))\ni\n\nAs explained in the previous section, this is equivalent to\na Coulomb gas of pair-tunnel events because\n!\ns\u22121\nX\n\u03bes exp\n(96)\n\u2206j = \u03bes exp(\u03c6j+s \u2212 \u03c6j )\n\n(93)\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c4\n\nX\ns\n\n\u03bes cos\n\ns\u22121\nX\n\nn=0\n\n\u2206i+n (\u03c4 )\n\n!#\n\n.\n\n(95)\n\nincreases the charge on grain j + s by 2e, and reduces\nthe charge on grain j by 2e at rate \u03bes . We have explicitly included longer range tunneling as this will, in any\n\n\f28\ncase, be produced under renormalization from the basic\nnearest neighbor tunneling which has rate \u03be1 = EJ . The\ndissipative interaction between a pair-tunnel of range s\nand a tunnel in the reverse direction a time \u03c4 later, is\n2r + sR\nlog(\u03c4 /\u03c40 )\nRQ\n\n(97)\n\nproportional to the total resistance through which normal\nrelaxation must occur to compensate for a Cooper-pair\ntunneling between grains separated by s.\nThe RG flows in powers of the fugacities of pair-tunnels\nare obtained similarly to those in the strong coupling\nregime in terms of QPS (see Sec. VIIB of Chapter 5 of\nRef. 80): indeed they have a similar structure to the RG\nfor the various QPS dipoles in the absence of individual\nQPS (Sec. IV H).\nIncluding the combining of pair tunnel pairs - such\nas one from j \u2212 s to j together with one from j to j + m\ninto a single one across m + s junctions - the RG flows\nare\n\u0010\n\u0011\nd\u03bes\n2r+sR\ndl = \u03bes 1 \u2212 RQ\nP 2r+mR+|s\u2212m|R\u2212sR\n(98)\n+\u03c40 12\n\u03bem \u03be|s\u2212m| .\nRQ\nm6=s\n\nNote that we have neglected the renormalization of two\noverlapping pair-tunnel events which do not share any\ngrains. Such events renormalize into a complicated noncontiguous compound four-tunnel events, and are more\nstrongly suppressed.\n\nC.\n\nPhase diagram and Normal-FSC transition for\nweak coupling\n\nThe trivial fixed point of the RG equations for the pairtunnel fugacities is the gaussian line with no pair-tunnel\nevents:\n\u03bes = 0\n\n\u2200s :\n\n(99)\n\nthis controls the low energy behavior of the normal phase\nof the chain. The normal fixed point is stable as long as\nall the {\u03bes } are irrelevant: since \u03be1 is the least irrelevant,\n> 1 , so that with R as the\nthis obtains when: 2r+R\nRQ\ntuning parameter, the critical point in the limit of zero\ncoupling is given by\n0\nRM\n= RQ \u2212 2r .\n\n(100)\n\n0\nWhen R < RM\n, the normal fixed point becomes unstable:\nCooper pair tunneling events proliferate and give rise to\nthe superconducting phase. Since all the non-linear terms\nin the RG flows of the {\u03b7s } are positive, these can only\n0\naccelerate this flow so that the condition R < RM\nis\ncertainly sufficient for superconductivity Formally, the\n\nflow is then toward large \u03be and eventually to the FSC\nfixed manifold where the QPS fugacity, \u03b6 is zero.\nBecause the non-linear contributions to the flows are\npositive, superconductivity can still occur when R + 2r >\nRQ and the {\u03bes } are irrelevant about the Gaussian fixed\npoint. If\n\u03b4\u2261\n\nR + 2r\n\u22121\nRQ\n\n(101)\n\nis small and positive, \u03be1 will be weakly irrelevant while\nthe other {\u03bes } are still strongly irrelevant. Nevertheless\n(as in Sec. IV H) the feedback of these to \u03be1 important.\nFor small \u03be1 this is dominated by the creation of \u03be2 at\norder \u03be12 , and the feedback of this into d\u03be1 /dl via the \u03be1 \u03be2\nterm. There is thus a critical fixed point with\n\u221a\n\u03be1\u2217 \u223c \u03b4\n(102)\nand \u03be2 \u223c \u03b4 \u226a \u03be1 . It can be seen that the longer range\n{\u03bes } attain fixed point values \u03bes\u2217 \u223c \u03b4 s/2 . [Indeed, with the\nsimple structure of the flows to quadratic order, an exact\ns\nfixed point can be found: \u03be s \u221d (B)\n\u221a with B an r and R\ndependent factor that is of order \u03b4 for small \u03b4. But this\nis not a controlled expansion for the fixed point except\nwhen \u03b4 is in any case small, or perhaps in some special\npart of parameter space.] Equation (102) corresponds\nto a critical fixed line that controls the critical surface\nof the mixed character normal-FSC transition. For \u03b4\nsmall, the critical EJc \u223c \u03be1c \u2248 \u03be1\u2217 (R, r): when EJ < EJc\nthe chain is in the NOR phase, while when EJ > EJc\nthe chain is superconducting. Note that equivalently, one\ncould pass from normal to superconducting phase at fixed\nJosephson coupling by decreasing R through its critical\nvalue RM , which, in the weak coupling limit is\nRM \u2248 RQ \u2212 2r + O(EJ2 ) .\n\n(103)\n\nThus the Josephson coupling decreases the amount of dissipation that is needed to cause superconductivity. This\nis the same underlying physics as that that makes the\ncontrol parameter in the strong coupling limit 21 K + \u03b1\nwhich is the sum of a\u221a Josephson part, and a dissipative part since \u03b1 \u221d 1/ R2 + 2rR. But, not surprisingly\ngiven the basic electrical properties of the chain discussed\nin Sec. II B, the combination of parameters that enter\nin the strong and weak coupling limits are quite different. In terms\np of the superconducting stiffness parameter,\nK = 2\u03c0 EJ /EC , the critical value of K for the mixed\ntransition is\n1\n\nKM \u223c (R + 2r \u2212 RQ ) 4\n\n(104)\n\nwhen this is small.\nThe critical behavior near the FSC-NOR transition\nwill be characterized by the exponent \u03bc with the\ncrossover energy scale going to zero as E\u00d7 \u223c |EJ \u2212 EJc |\u03bc .\n\n\f29\n\nK\n\nr/RQ =0.1\n\n6\n\nK\n\nSC *\n\n5\n\nr/RQ =0.3\n\n6\n\nSC *\n\n5\n\nFSC\n\n4\n\nFSC\n\n4\n3\n\n3\n2\n\n2\n\nNOR\n\n1\n\nNOR\n\n1\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\nR Q /R\n\nr/RQ =0.4\n\n6\n5\n\nSC *\n\nK\n\n5\n\n4\n\nr/RQ =0.6\n\n6\n\nSC *\n\nK\n\nR Q /R\n\n4\n\nFSC\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\nFSC\n\n1\n\n1\n\nNOR\n\nNOR\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nR Q /R\n\nR Q /R\n-\n\nFIG. 9: Phase diagram with the weak Josephson coupling results. The solid lines represent the transition lines obtained with\nthe strong coupling phase-slip\napproach (Sec. IV). The dotted line is obtained from extending Eq. (102) by solving the flow\n\u221a\nequations (98): K \u223c \u221a1r \u03b4. The two approaches seem to cross into each other continuously. The meeting point of the weak\nand strong-coupling boundaries is likely to be a bi-critical point where the transition changes its nature, but our methods are\nlimited in that regime.\n\nThe critical exponent, \u03bc is a continuously varying function of the resistances. For small \u03b4, the above analysis\nyields\n\u03bc\u2248\n\n1\n.\n2\u03b4\n\n(105)\n\nThe rapid fall-off with distance, s, of the fixed point values, \u03bes\u2217 , of the pair tunneling amplitudes suggests that the\nfixed point does not have a long length scale associated\nwith it, at least coming from the normal side. Whether\nthere is a more subtle diverging length scale - e.g. that\ncharacterizes the decay with distance of the superconducting correlations, we leave for future investigation.\nThe important features of the weak-coupling phase diagram are shown in Fig. 9. When 2r + R > RQ , the normal phase can exist; otherwise the chain will be fully superconducting. But even for this high resistance regime,\nstrong enough Josephson coupling can cause superconductivity. Along the phase boundary - actually a critical hypersurface in the parameters of our model - the\ncritical behavior will vary continuously.\n\nThis analysis of the weak coupling regime thus almost\ncompletes the phase diagrams of Fig. 9. The one exception is the nature of the bicritical point at which the weak\ncoupling section of the mixed-transition phase boundary\nmeets the small-intermediate coupling KT section. As\nmentioned in the introduction, this does not appear to\nbe amenable to perturbative analysis. A related question\nis whether, for intermediate coupling in terms of the QPS\nfugacities and pair tunneling amplitudes as well as K, the\nweak coupling segment of the mixed transition boundary\ncan meet the large-intermediate coupling dipole driven\nsegment without an intervening KT section. And, if so,\ndo they come together smoothly or with another type\nof bicritical point. Again, this is not analyzable by our\nmethods.\n\nVI.\n\nNANOWIRES\n\nThe discussion so far has concentrated on the phase diagram of a discrete chain of shunted Josephson junctions.\n\n\f30\n\u03c6\n\n\u03be\n\n\u03be\n\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\nphase\u2212slips\n\n0\n\n...\n\n...\n\n\u2206\n\nFIG. 10: Schematic of a QPS in a continuous wire. The\nsize of the core of a QPS - in which the superconductivity\nis suppressed - is of order the superconducting coherence\nlength \u03be.

Their net effect is two\npartial phase slips of size \u2206, a distance \u03be apart.\n\nA.\n\nOne of the motivations for this work, however, came from\nthe observation of superconducting-normal transitions in\nnanowires reported in Refs. [23, 24, 86\u201388] (for earlier experiments see also [66\u201369]). In this section we will show\nhow one can describe the superconductor-to-normal transition in superconducting nanowires by carefully taking\nthe continuum limit a \u2192 0 of the discrete model discussed before. Thermally activated phase slips in superconducting wires have been considered by Langer and\nAmbegaokar [89] and by McCumber and Halperin [90].\nQuantum phase slips in superconducting wires have been\ndiscussed previously in Refs. 64\u201366, 91\u201394.\nThe fundamental difference between a continuous wire\nand a discrete JJ chain is the existence of the lattice constant in the chain. The interplay between the lattice constant, a, and the charge relaxation length, \u03bbQ , played an\nimportant role in JJ chains. In a wire, the characteristic\ndissipative length becomes\nr\np\nar\n\u221a\n\u03bbQ = a r/R =\n= 1/ \u03b3\u03c1\nR/a\n\n(106)\n\n1\nwhere \u03b3 = ra\nis the phenomenological parameter describing the conversion conductance-per-length from the\nnormal to superconducting fluids, and \u03c1 = R/a is the\nresistance-per-length of the wire. Nanowires are often\nmodeled as discrete chains of Josephson junctions with a\nlattice constant of the order of the superconducting coherence length, a = \u03be. [64] The motivation for this is\nthat a typical size of a QPS should be of the order of \u03be.\nBut from our discussion of JJ chains, it is clear that another important length is the smallest possible distance\nbetween QPS. In the case of JJ chains it is a, but for continuous wires it may be arbitrarily small. So the correct\ndescription of the wire can be obtained from JJ models\nonly by carrying out the a \u2192 0 limit with the coherence\nlength, \u03be, fixed (see Fig 10).\n\n\u2206\n\nDipoles in nanowires\n\nPhysically, the continuity of the wire and the limit\na \u2192 0 allows the formation of dipoles of phase slips that\nare arbitrarily close to each other - up to charge discreteness effects which are discussed below. The closer\ntogether the phase-slips are, the better is their screening\nfrom the dissipative interaction, which is the only low\nenergy effect that suppresses the proliferation of dipoles\nin a discrete JJ chain. This decreased dissipative interaction between them means that small dipoles in a wire\nwill always proliferate. At zero temperature, a wire will\nthus always be either in the SC\u22c6 phase or in the normal\nphase.\nThis point can be made clearer by specifying how the\ncontinuum limit of a wire is taken. One method of taking\nthis limit is spreading a phase slip over about \u03be/a \u226b 1\njunctions, since a phase slip in a thin (diameter less than\n\u03be) wire suppresses the superconducting order parameter\nover a length \u03be. This can be taken into account in the\nsine-Gordon action by changing the cosine term in Eq.\n(48):\ncos (\u03c8i (\u03c4 ) + \u03b8i (\u03c4 )) \u2192\n\u0015\nP\ncos a h(an) (\u03c8i+n (\u03c4 ) + \u03b8i+n (\u03c4 ))\n\u0014\n\n(107)\n\nn\n\nwhere h(x) is a weighting function concentrated in a region of length of order \u03be with the constraint\nZ\nX\ndxh(x) \u2248 a\nh(an) = 1\n(108)\nn\n\nThis constraint on h ensures that the total phase involved\ncorresponds to one phase slip: it is forced by the global\nsymmetry \u03b8 \u2192 \u03b8 + 2\u03c0. The UV cutoff will no longer be\nset by the shortest lengths, but be of order \u03a9 = c/\u03be or\nthe Ginzburg-Landau time, which is related to the gap\n(in a way that depends on whether the superconductivity\nis in the dirty or clean limit). Although the operator in\nEq. (107) breaks a phase slip into parts that are fractions\nof 2\u03c0, it does not lead to independent fractional phaseslips; because of the 2\u03c0 periodicity of the cosine, the\n\n\f31\nfractional phase slips always appear together as a part\nof a complete phase slip. The structure of a smeared\nphase slip is shown in Fig. 10. The smearing means\nthat the induced electrochemical potential drop caused\nby the phase slip is split into fractional potential drops\nthat occur over roughly \u03be/a junctions adding up to the\nquantized drop of a single phase slip. The continuum\nlimit a \u2192 0 can now be taken.\nBecause of the dissipation, an individual QPS in the\nwire will have action that diverges logarithmically at low\ntemperatures, as in the chain. The effective dissipation\nparameter is given by\nZ\nZ\nr\n1 \u03b3 \u2212|x\u2212y|/\u03bbQ\n\u03b1 = dx h(x) dy h(y)\n.\n(109)\ne\n2 \u03c1\nThere are now two limits of interest. If \u03bbQ \u226a \u03be (but still\n\u03bbQ \u226b a so that the discreteness does not matter) the\nparameter is\n\u03b1\u223c\n\nRQ\n\u03c1\u03be\n\n(110)\n\nwith the coefficient depending on the form of h(x) as\nshould be expected: there is no unique way of defining\nthe core size of a phase slip. This result involves the\nnormal resistance over a distance \u03be: thus in the wire \u03c1\u03be\n(rather than \u03c1a) plays the role of R in the JJ chain. But\nin general, \u03c1\u03be is not the relevant resistance, in contrast\nto what would have been guessed from this analogy.\nIf \u03bbQ \u226b \u03be, \u03be does not play a role in the dissipation\nand the behavior is similar to the JJ chain for \u03bbQ \u226b a\nso that\nr\n\u03b3\n1\n(111)\n\u03b1 \u2248 RQ\n2\n\u03c1\n\u221a\nanalogous to 1/2 rR for the chain. In this limit, \u03b1 will\nbe of order unity when the normal resistance of a length\n\u03be of the wire is still small.\nBy analogy with the JJ chain, one would expect that\nthe condition for breakdown of superconductivity would\nbe controlled by the coefficient of the total interaction\nbetween QPS at the same position but different times,\nK + 2\u03b1. From the arguments of Sec. IV F, one would\nexpect the critical value of this coefficient to be three. Indeed, there should be a change in the behavior near when\nthis condition is met, but it will not be a true transition\nbecause of the role of dipoles.\nA pair of opposite sign phase slips separated by a distance \u2206 - a dipole with moment \u2206 - will have infinite\naction at zero temperature because of the dissipation.\nBut the dissipative interactions between the QPS that\nextend out to \u2206 of order the greater of \u03bbQ and \u03be will\nreduce the coefficient, \u03b2(\u2206) of the logarithmic action of\nthe dipole.\nAs in the chain, a pair of equal and opposite dipoles\nwith the same location but separated in time will have\n\naction\n2\u03b2(\u2206) ln(\u03c4 /\u03c40 )\n\n(112)\n\nwith the dissipative parameter a function of the resistances and the dipole moment, \u2206, relative to \u03be and \u03bbQ .\nIn the limit that \u2206 \u226a min(\u03be, \u03bbQ ), for smooth weighting\nfunction h, the action can be expanded in powers of \u2206\nyielding\n\u03b2\u223c\n\n\u22062\nRQ\n.\n\u03c1\u03be [max(\u03bb, \u03be)]2\n\n(113)\n\nFor \u03be \u226a \u03bbQ , there will a change in behavior from\nquadratic to linear dependence on \u2206 for \u2206 \u223c \u03be: the\nlarger moment behavior then being like the JJ chain with\n\u03bbQ \u226a a so that \u03b2 saturates to \u2248 2\u03b1 at \u2206 \u223c \u03bbQ . For\n\u03be \u226b \u03bbQ , \u03b2 will crossover from quadratic to saturating at\n\u2206 \u223c \u03be.\nBecause \u03b2 decreases to zero as \u2206 \u2192 0, independent of\nthe dissipative parameters or of \u03be, for sufficiently small\n\u2206, \u03b2 will be less than unity and thus dipoles will proliferate - as long as very small dipoles can be modeled as\nwe have done here. The characteristic moment \u2206 below\nwhich dipole proliferation occurs is\nq\n(114)\n\u2206\u00d7 \u223c max(\u03bbQ , \u03be) \u03c1\u03be/RQ\n\nprovided this is less than \u03be, otherwise a different dependence obtains. Nevertheless, we see that independent of\nthe relative magnitudes of \u03be and \u03bbQp\n, dipoles of moment\n\u03be will not proliferate as long as 1/ \u03c1/\u03b3 < Ch RQ with\nCh an order-unity coefficient that depends on details of\nthe structure on scale \u03be.\nIf dipoles of size of order \u03be can proliferate, the behavior\nwill be similar to the JJ chain when s = 1 dipoles, the\nsmallest size, proliferate. The dipole proliferation will,\nat low energies, lead to screening of the dissipative interactions between individual QPS and thus to either the\nSC\u22c6 phase or the normal phase depending on whether\nthe renormalized K is greater than or less than four.\nBut if only dipoles of size \u2206 \u226a \u03be can proliferate on\ntheir own, the behavior will be quantitatively different.\nAlthough it is not clear what pairs of QPS whose separation is much less than \u03be represent, they should correspond to large amplitude localized fluctuations of the\nsuperconductivity that act to decouple the superconducting from the normal degrees of freedom. The effects of\nthese will be to renormalize the dissipative interactions\nbetween larger moment dipoles and individual QPS by\ndecreasing the rate of the processes, parametrized by \u03b3,\nthat relax imbalances between the superconducting and\nnormal voltages. Again, if the dipole moments can be\narbitrarily small, this will eventually lead to either the\nSC\u22c6 or the normal phase. But if the bare rate of the\nsmall-dipole-like processes, \u03b7(\u2206), is small, there should\nbe interesting crossovers as temperature is lowered associated with the growth at low energies of these dipole\n\n\f32\nfugacities before they fully screen the dissipative interactions.\nIn principle, even in a chain of grains linked by Josephson junctions QPSs need not take place only across the\njunctions but could happen inside a grain - albeit with\nmuch higher action and hence exponentially lower fugacity. But in the limit of extremely low temperatures, such\nprocesses need to be considered and the chain will be\nmore like a nanowire. In particular, the effects of QPS\ndipoles with very small size within one grain will, by\nthe arguments above, be relevant. Eventually, these will\nscreen the superconducting fluctuations from the dissipative interactions and drive the system into the SC\u22c6 or\nnormal phases: again, if arbitrarily small dipoles can occur, the FSC phase will not exist in the limit of asymptotically low temperatures.\nB.\n\nMinimum size QPS dipoles?\n\nIn all the above, we have assumed that arbitrarily small\nQPS dipoles can exist: in the continuum model we have\nused, even with short distance cutoffs, there seems to\nbe no reason these cannot occur. But as the QPS are\nquantum objects, we must be careful of the possibility of\ncomplex - rather than purely real - actions.\nIn a QPS dipole, the superconducting phase, \u03c6(x),\ninside the dipole winds by 2\u03c0 as \u03c4 goes from \u2212\u221e to\n+\u221e (see Sec. III B). As long as \u03c6(x, \u03c4 ) is periodic in\n\u03c4 \u2208 (0, \u03b2), a QPS dipole of the opposite sign is needed to\nsatisfy this condition. But in reality, the true condition\nis that \u03c6 is periodic in 0 to \u03b2 modulo 2\u03c0. In the limit\nof zero temperature, this will have no effect in the action\nwe have studied. But in general, there is an additional\nterm in the action, analogous to a Berry phase, of the\nform:\nZ\nZ \u03b2\n\u2202\u03c6\n,\n(115)\nSw = i dx\nd\u03c4 \u00f1S\n\u2202\u03c4\n0\n\nwith \u00f1S having units of number density. In a Galilean\ninvariant system, at zero temperature \u00f1S would be the\ndensity of Cooper pairs, equal to half the electron number\ndensity. But more generally, it can have any value, positive, negative, or zero: \u00f1S is some effective density for\nthe superfluid that has no known simple interpretation.\nIt will depend on particle-hole asymmetry and other factors that are not understood [95, 96]. For vortices in a 2d\nfilm, \u00f1S corresponds to a dual magnetic field, and it gives\nrise to a vortex hall effect [97]. [Note that in GinzburgLandau theory, only the combination nS /m\u2217 is physical:\nnS , in contrast to the phase stiffness, \u03a5 - often called\n\u03c1S - has no physical meaning. Quantum mechanically,\nthis is no longer true.]\nThe action of a dipole of moment \u2206 has an imaginary\npart of its action from the Berry phase term:\ndipole\nSw\n= 2\u03c0i\u00f1S \u2206 .\n\n(116)\n\nThis suggests that dipoles for which \u00f1S \u2206 is not an integer will undergo destructive interference implying that \u2206\nshould be quantized in units of 1/\u00f1S . The QPS dipoles\ncan be considered as a vortex which first crosses the wire\nin one dircetion, and then returns and cuts the wire in\nthe opposite direction at a distance \u2206 away from the first\ncrossing, before returning to its origin. Interpreting \u00f1S\nas Cooper pair density, the quantization of \u2206 means that\nthe vortex had to \"go around\" integer numbers of Cooper\npairs[98].\nIf there is indeed a minimum size QPS dipole with\n\u2206min =\n\n1\n,\n\u00f1S\n\n(117)\n\nand the low frequency coupling to the \"normal\" degrees\nof freedom is still effectively dissipative for such small\ndipoles, then it is possible that the dissipation could be\nsufficiently strong to suppress these smallest dipoles. [Although, the effective coupling, \u03b2(\u2206min ), would be determined by the shorter length scale physics which will not\nbe well parametrized by \u03b3 and \u03c1.] If the smallest dipoles\nare indeed suppressed, then an FSC phase - and a transition from it to an SC\u22c6 or a normal phase - would be\npossible in nanowires.\nIt is worth noting that effects of a small local disturbance can be long range in time and give rise to actions\nthat diverge logarithmically as temperature is lowered.\nAn example is an impurity in a metal that is moved by\na small amount: the divergent action is associated with\nthe \"orthogonality catastrophe\" caused by the changes\nin the electron wave-functions induced by the altered potential. [99] Better known, but closely related, is the\nX-ray edge singularity [100]. Thus it is not unreasonable\nto think that a local change in the superconducting degrees of freedom could result in a logarithmically infinite\naction associated with the response of the quasiparticles\nand other low energy degrees of freedom to the change.\nWhether or not the FSC phase can occur, even in principle, we leave as an intriguing open question.\n\nVII.\n\nRESISTIVITY\n\nIn the previous sections we concentrated on the zero\ntemperature phase diagram of the RSJJ chain shown in\nFig. 1(c). We now extend this analysis to discuss the\ntemperature dependence of the resistivity of the system\nusing the RG flow equations obtained in Section III D.\nOne of the most surprising results is that in the normal\nphase close to the superconductor-to-normal transition\nthe system exhibits a non-monotonic R(T ) dependence.\nIn this regime one finds that the resistivity first decreases\nwith decreasing temperature, then saturates and stays\nnearly constant at a value R(T ) \u226a R, i.e., much smaller\nthan the normal resistance of the chain, down to very\n\n\f33\n\u2212\n\nResistance of a single junction\n\n(118)\n\nThe voltage fluctuations caused by QPS are tricky to\nestimate because of the interactions between them. But\nif we renormalize until an energy scale at which the QPS\nare weakly interacting, T (l) \u223c \u03a9, then the fluctuations\ncan be estimated simply.\nThe phase-slip fugacity \u03b6l and the temperature of a\nsingle RSJJ obey the flow equations [85]:\n\u0010\n\u0011\nRQ\nd\u03b6l\n,\ndl = \u03b6l 1 \u2212 R\n(119)\ndTl\n=\nT\nl\ndl\nwith the high energy cutoff, \u03a90 , initially of order the\nplasma frequency of the circuit. When the RG flow\nreaches the stage in which Tl \u223c \u03a9, only one pair of\nphase slips (they must come in pairs because of the periodic boundary conditions in \u03c4 ) is likely in the rescaled\n\n* region\n\n2\n\n\u03a4/\u03a9\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.1\n\nK=3\n\n-2\n-4\n\nK=4.2\n\n-6\n\nb.\n\nThe RG analysis presented in this paper allows one\nto calculate the scaling behavior - including crossovers\n- of the temperature dependence of the resistance of a\nJJ chain. The simplest way to do this is to carry out\nthe RG flow until the UV cutoff becomes of order the\ntemperature. At lower energy scales the renormalized\nphase slips are only weakly interacting and their effects\nindependent.\nTo obtain physical quantities, we must distinguish between the \"bare\" parameters - those that appear in\nthe action with the initial high energy cutoff - and the\nrenormalized parameters. In situations in which there\nmight be confusion, we denote the renormalized parameters with subscripts, l, corresponding to energy scale\n\u03a9 = \u03a90 e\u2212l .\nWe first consider a single resistively shunted Josephson junction and estimate the (superconducting) voltage\nfluctuations across it at a low temperature, T . At low\nfrequencies, the resistance of the superconducting part\ncontrols the low frequency fluctuations via\nhV (\u03c9)V (\u03c9 \u2032 )i = RT * 2\u03c0\u03b4(\u03c9 + \u03c9 \u2032 ) .\n\nSC\n\nFSC region\n\nln \u03c1a/R Q\n\nA.\n\na.\nln \u03c1a/R Q\n\nlow temperatures, and only then finally starts to increase. During this long crossover, the Josephson junctions themselves form a resistive channel, parallel to the\nshunt resistors. Since experiments have a lower limit of\ntemperature, such behavior may appear to support the\nexistence of the \"metallic phase\" [14] separating the superconducting and insulating ones.\nWe start by showing how one can obtain the resistance\nvs. temperature curves from the RG flow for the QPS fugacity. We then proceed to discuss the finite temperature\nresistivity in the FSC and SC\u22c6 regions, and explain the\norigin of the quasi-metallic behavior in some of the NOR\nregion.\n\n\u039a+2\u03b1=2\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n\u03a4/\u03a9\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.1\n\n-2\n-4\n\n\u039a+2\u03b1=3.5\n\n-6\n\u2212\n\nFIG. 12: Semi-log plot of the resistance vs. temperature\nfor various values of K.

(122). But these corrections\nvanish in the limit of zero-temperature and zero-current.\n\nB.\n\nWe now turn to the JJ chain. In the FSC phase, each\njunction behaves similarly to a single junction in its superconducting phase and thus contributes roughly independently to the total resistance. Phase slip dipoles, with\nfugacities {\u03b7s }, are the explicit manifestation of interaction between phase slips on different junctions. Thus\nwhen all the {\u03b7s } are irrelevant about the FSC fixed line,\nthe phase slips in each junction will be almost independent - although their dissipation involves overlapping\nresistors. Thus each Josephson junction will act like the\na single junction with resistance given by Eq. (122), with\nthe appropriate \u03b6T - the renormalized fugacity at scale\nT \u223c \u03a9 - of individual QPS in the chain:\nRJJ\n\n(123)\n\nAt intermediate temperatures (what we mean by intermediate is discussed in Sec.

The origin of the factor of T can be seen from\nthe transformation that related the flow of \u03b6l to the flow\n3\nof the parameters z \u221d \u03b6l exp(\u2212l/2) and x = K\n2 +\u03b1\u2212 2\nwhich obey the Kosterlitz Thouless flows Eqs. (84).\nWhen \u03b6 is small, x = 0 - at which z is weakly scale\ndependent - marks the FSC-NOR transition. The scale\ndependence of the relationship between z and \u03b6l transT 2\nforms Eq. (123) to RJJ \u223c RQ \u03c402 \u03b6T2 \u223c RQ \u03a9\nzT giving rise\nto the factor of T in terms the \"natural\" variable z. As\nwe shall see, this really is natural for the KT-like global\ntransition from the SC\u22c6 phase to the normal phase.\nThe behavior of RJJ (T ) near the FSC-NOR transition\nis shown in Fig. 12(b). The results in Eqs. (80-82) lead\nto a regime of parameters in which a crossover between\nquasi-superconducting and normal behavior takes place:\nin particular, the resistance exhibits a minimum at a low\ntemperature. This behavior arises on the normal side of\nthe transition, but still close to it: when\n\u03c1M\nm \u223c\n\n3\nK\n+\u03b1< ,\n(127)\n2\n2\nso that \u03b6l initially decreases with scale even though z is\nincreasing. If the bare fugacity is small, this gives rise\nto an intermediate temperature regime with a power law\ndecreasing resistance with exponent 0 < \u0393 < 1. But at\nlow enough energies, the rapid increase of z will give rise\nto proliferation of dipoles and individual QPS and the \u03b6l\nwill start to grow. The junction then crosses over to insulating behavior as the temperature is lowered further.\nNear the transition to the FSC phase, the crossover temperature, Tmin , at which the resistive minimum occurs\nbecomes very low:\n\u0011\n\u0010\np\n(128)\nTmin \u223c \u03a90 exp \u2212b/ KM \u2212 K\n1<\n\nResistivity in the FSC region\n\nh 2 2\n\u03c4 \u03b6 .\n\u223c\n(2e)2 0 T\n\n\u0393 = K + 2\u03b1 \u2212 2 .\n\n(124)\n\nwith the (positive) exponent \u0393 depending on the normal\nresistances and the superconducting stiffness, K.\n\nwith b a coefficient proportional to the bare QPS fugacity,\n\u03b6, when this is small. Below the crossover temperature,\nthe measured resistivity, \u03c1m , of the chain will increase as\nthe temperature is lowered, until it reaches the resistance\nof the shunt resistors, R/a.\nC.\n\nResistivity in the SC\u22c6 region\n\nThe low temperature behavior in the SC\u22c6 phase can\nbe understood similarly. When the renormalized dipole\n\n\f35\nfugacities are large, dissipation will be screened and we\nneed only consider individual QPS and the interactions\nbetween them mediated by the superconducting degrees\nof freedom.\nIt is now simplest to use the isotropic RG and rescale\nspace and time. When the RG flow reaches the stage\nwhere T (l) = \u03a9, the spatial size of a QPS is \u03a90 /T times\nits original size. Therefore, when resistances per unit\nlength are found from renormalized quantities, a factor\nof the length rescaling is needed to obtain the physical\nresistivities. The resistivity of the Josephson junctions,\nwill thus be\n\u0012 \u0013\u0393\n\u03a90\nRQ\nT RQ\n(129)\n(\u03b6T /\u03a9)2 \u223c\n(\u03b6/\u03a9)2\n\u03c1JJ \u223c\n\u03a90 a\na\nT\nwith\n\u0393 = 1 + (K \u2212 4)\n\n(130)\n\nthe K \u2212 4 being minus twice the eigenvalue of \u03b6 in the\nisotropic RG. We have assumed that the basic length\nscale that enters is the grain spacing, a, and used the\nbare QPS fugacity \u03b6: more generally these will depend\non the higher energy processes as discussed below.\nThe resistivity as a function of temperature is plotted\nfor several values of K in Fig. 12(a) Since for K < KG =\n4 the chain will be normal at low temperatures and the\nresistivity increase to R/a, for the intermediate range\n3<K<4\n\n(131)\n\nthe resistivity will decrease with decreasing T and have\na minimum at a crossover temperature Tmin given by\nthe energy scale at which the QPS proliferate enough to\nscreen the longer-range interactions between them driving the junctions normal. This range is analogous to the\nintermediate regime of Eq. (127) near the FSC phase: In\nboth cases the resistivity seems to show signs of superconductivity before exhibiting insulating behavior. For\nK \u2248 3 the flat resistivity curves over a substantial temperature range could be confused for a quasi-metallic\nphase.\nD.\n\nRoles of dipoles\n\nIn the JJ chain, if the QPS fugacities are small and\nthe dissipative interactions substantial, the QPS fugacity can be irrelevant, but the dipoles may be relevant\nabout the FSC fixed line. In this case, the SC\u22c6 phase\nbehavior can obtain only at low enough energies below\nwhich the QPS dipoles proliferate: this makes the temperature dependence of the resistivity much richer than\nthat discussed so far. If the SC\u22c6 phase is not stable, the\nresistivity near the dipole driven FSC-NOR transition,\nwill involve a crossover from dipole to individual QPS\ndominated resistivity.\n\nThe temperature behavior of the resistivity in both\nthese cases splits into two regimes. Since the {\u03b7s } are\nzero initially, and get generated at order \u03b6 2 , at temperatures in the range TD < T < \u03a90 we expect the JJ chain\nto behave as though it were in the FSC region. The\ncrossover temperature TD , away from the FSC regime\nis the energy scale at which \u03b71 becomes of order \u03a9: at\nlower energies, the dissipative interactions get screened\n(see discussion above Eq. (75)). At energies higher than\nTD , the scaling is similar to that of individual junctions,\nwhile at lower temperatures, it will become isotropic as\nin the SC\u22c6 regime discussed above, and exhibit normal\nbehavior at sufficiently low energies if K is too small to\nstabilize the SC\u22c6 phase.\nWe now estimate TD , and discuss its consequences for\nthe low temperature behavior. The flows of \u03b71 when it\nis relevant can be well approximated by an initial rapid\nregime in which \u03b71 becomes of order \u03b6 2 /\u03a90 , followed by\na scaling regime in which it grows with exponent 1 \u2212 \u03b2\nwith \u03b2 = 2\u03b1(1 \u2212 w) as in Sec. IV H. Thus it will become\nof order \u03a9 at an energy scale\nT D \u223c \u03a90\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03a90\n\u03b6\n\n\u00132/(1\u2212\u03b2)\n\n(132)\n\nfor \u03b2 below its critical value of unity for either the FSCSC\u22c6 or the FSC-NOR dipole-driven transitions. This is\nvalid as long as \u03b6l2 grows less rapidly than \u03b71 : i.e. if\n2 \u2212 2\u03b1 \u2212 K < 1 \u2212 \u03b2. This is always the case if K > 1\nand sometimes also at smaller K if w is substantial. If\n\u03b6l2 grows more rapidly than exp[(1 \u2212 \u03b2)l], then \u03b71 follows\n\u03b6l2 and individual QPS will drive the crossover to normal\nbehavior.\nFor T > TD , the individual-junction controlled behavior found above for the resistivity in the FSC phase (and\nfor crossover away from FSC) will obtain:\nR \u223c T K+2\u03b1\u22122 .\n\n(133)\n\nBut below TD the temperature dependence of the resistivity will be like that in the SC\u22c6 phase (or the flow away\nfrom that) with \u03c1m \u223c T K\u22123 .\nAs before, if K < 4, at low enough temperatures the\nchain will crossover to normal behavior and the resistivity\nsaturate at R/a, while if K > 4 the resistivity will go to\nzero more rapidly than linearly.\nWe have seen in this section that the interplay between\nlocal and long-length scale physics gives rise to interesting behavior of the resistivities. Perhaps surprisingly,\nthe temperature dependence near the critical point of the\nQPS driven mixed transition, for which the critical value\nof the parameter 21 \u03ba + \u03b1 is 32 , midway between the values\nof 1 and 2 expected for local and global transitions, nevertheless is similar to that of the global transition with\n\u03c1m \u223c T , with the T arising from spatial rescaling.\nUnfortunately, the form of the various crossovers of\nthe resistivity as a function of temperature, which would\n\n\f36\n\nSuperconducting\ngrains\n\nInsulating\nlayer\n\n...\n111\n000\n00\n11\n00\n11\n000\n111\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00000000000000000000000000\n11111111111111111111111111\n000 11\n111\n00 11\n00\n00000000000000000000000000\n11111111111111111111111111\n\n...\n\n11111111111111111111111111\n00000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000\n11111111111111111111111111\n00000000000000000000000000\n11111111111111111111111111\nMetallic nanowire\n\nFIG. 13: Possible realization of a two-fluid JJ chain: mesoscopic superconducting grains deposited on top of a metallic\nnanowire and separated by a thin insulating layer, to produce\nan SIS junction.\n\nyield firmer testable predictions, are not readily accessible to our analysis since these involve analyzing a\nsine-Gordon model in the intermediate coupling-strength\nregime. In addition, we have been rather cavalier about\nwhich resistivity we are considering: in general, even in\nsimple scaling regimes, the resistivity at \u03c9 \u223c T and the\nDC resistivity can be quite different. The latter certainly\nrequires proper real-time analysis.\n\nVIII.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn this final section we discuss some implications of\nthe results presented in this paper, and issues associated\nwith these.\nChains of Mesoscopic Josephson Junctions. Several groups have recently reported experimental realizations of mesoscopic superconducting grains [102] and arrays of low-capacitance Josephson junctions [19, 35, 36,\n47\u201351]. The possibility of introducing ohmic dissipation\nusing shunt resistors has been demonstrated for a single\nquantum Josephson junction by Pentill\u00e4 et al. [36], and\nWatanabe and Haviland [19], and for arrays of Josephson\njunctions by Takahide et al. [53] and Miyazaki et al. [57].\nA potential realization of a chain of mesoscopic Josephson junctions with ohmic dissipation is shown in Fig. 13.\nIt consists of equally spaced small superconducting grains\non top of a metallic nanowire with thin insulating layers\nseparating the two materials. This system is a realization of the model that we presented in Sec. III, with\nthe possibility of controlling separately the parameters\nEJ , EC , R, and r by changing the width of the metallic wire, the size and separation of the superconducting\ngrains, and the strength of the tunnel barriers between\nthe grains and between the grains and normal wire. A\nschematic phase diagram of this system is presented in\nFigs. 7, and 9 (we did not consider odd-even effects in the\ngrains, which must be irrelevant if r < RQ , as discussed\nbelow). Both the phase diagram and the character of the\n\ntransitions are affected by the superconducting-normal\nrelaxation parametrized by r. [124].\nIf the metallic wire is highly resistive and/or the tunnel barrier between the S (superconducting) and N (normal) parts weak, the dissipation will not be important,\nthe FSC phase will not occur, and the superconductorto-normal transition will be determined primarily by the\ncompetition between Josephson coupling and Coulomb\ncharging energy of the grains. This will be a quantum Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, isotropic in space\nand time, with the energy scale decreasing exponentially\nas the transition is approached.\nIf the wire is less resistive and/or the SN tunnel junction stronger, the FSC phase can occur. The FSC to normal phase boundary and the FSC to SC\u22c6 phase boundary\nwill be dominated by dissipative effects. These change,\nin particular, the nature of the superconductor-to-normal\ntransition which will have a mixed character with both\nlocal and global physics involved. This mixed transition\ncan either be KT-like - although modified from the conventional KT transition - or have strongly anisotropic\npower law scaling with continuously variable exponents.\nThe renormalization group analysis presented in this\npaper allows us to obtain the scaling form of the chain's\nresistivity as a function of temperature in the vicinity\nof the various superconductor-to-normal transitions; the\nresults are presented in Fig. 12. Near the SC\u22c6 to normal\nphase boundary, our results agree with the results in Refs.\n[64, 65], but the analysis of R(T ) in the vicinity of the\nFSC-to-normal phase boundary is new. We find that in\nboth cases the system has extended crossover regions on\nthe normal side of the transition, in which superconducting tendencies give rise to a weakly temperature dependent resistivity that decreases as a small power of T over\na wide temperature range before turning up at the lowest\ntemperatures as it becomes asymptotically normal. Near\nthe superconductor-to-normal phase boundary this upturn in R(T ) occurs at temperatures that are are either\npower-law or exponentially small in the inverse of the deviation from the zero-temperature transition, depending\non the regime.\nOur RG approach to the problem is also new, and allowed us to expose a myriad of crossover effects occurring near phase boundaries. Particularly interesting is\nthe interplay between global and local mechanisms for\nthe breakdown of superconductivity. The mixed FSC normal transition, for example, can arise from the local\nresistive environment, or from a combination of the longwavelength plasmon dissipation and the local resistive\nparts. The phase boundaries for which these two mechanisms obtain meet at a bicritical point, which has a rich\ncrossover behavior yet to be analyzed in full. The SC\u22c6 normal transition is shown to be global, i.e., determined\nby the long-wavelength excitations, and thus, for an infinite chain, the low energy critical behavior is almost\nindependent of the resistive shunting or the two-fluid na-\n\n\f37\nSuperconducting\nnanowire\n\nInsulating\nlayer\n\n111111111111111111111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n1111111111111111111111111111\n0000000000000000000000000000\n000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n111111111111111111111111111111111111111111\nMetallic nanowire\nFIG. 14: Schematic of a type of superconducting nanowire\nwith dissipative degrees of freedom: a superconducting layer\nis deposited on top of a metallic nanowire with an insulating\nlayer in between.\n\nture of the grains, except for their effects in modifying\nthe effective capacitances and Josephson couplings.\nOther aspects of the phases and phase transitions could\nalso be investigated for a chain of grains. Of particular\ninterest would be tunneling into pairs of grains, studying\nthe behavior as a function of their separation and of temperature, and how these change near phase transitions.\nSuperconducting Nanowires. Various types of superconducting nanowires can have dissipation down to\nzero temperature. The simplest is perhaps a wire with\nregions that remain normal, so that it has a positive density of states at zero energy. Another possibility is a\nsandwich of superconducting and metallic nanowires separated by a thin insulating barrier (see Fig. 14). But even\nnanowires made of a conventional gapped superconductor may have low energy degrees of freedom that give rise\nto dissipation when they are close to a superconductorto-normal transition. The conventional BCS theory of\nsuperconductivity, which leads to an energy gap, is intrinsically based on a mean-field analysis and thus unlikely\nto be reliable in the vicinity of a quantum phase transition when virtual quantum phase slips occur. A roughly\nanalogous effect is seen in superfluid 4 He in a disordered\nporous medium (e.g. Vycor): an apparent normal fluid\ncomponent has been observed down to the lowest temperatures [103]. In general, one would expect dissipation of some sort - but not necessarily ohmic - near\nsuperconductor-to-normal quantum transitions as long as\nsome of the Cooper-pairs break apart near the transition. This may not occur if the Cooper pairs form tightly\nbound bosons that still exist in the non-superconducting\nphase, but more generally should occur. Furthermore,\nif the normal phase is a Bose or Fermi glass, there will\nbe a constant density of states of low energy excitations\nand concomitant dissipation arising from local two level\nsystems. That said, the approach we have taken in this\npaper is phenomenological: we assume that dissipation is\npresent in at least some superconducting nanowires and\nthen study its consequences.\nFor superconducting nanowires, our analysis of the\nsimplest model suggests that nanowires will always be either in the SC\u22c6 or the normal phase with the FSC phase\n\nunstable to small QPS dipoles. The superconductornormal transition would then generally be of global KT\ncharacter. But if the fugacity of phase slips is low,\nand the dissipative effects large, there will be interesting\ncrossovers in the temperature and length-scale dependent\nproperties in both the superconducting phase, and near\nthe transition.\nNevertheless, as discussed in the Sec. VI, these conclusions may not be correct. In particular, charge discreteness effects can lead to interference between QPS\ndipoles which would set a minimum size for dipoles in\nthe limit of zero temperature. If the dissipation is strong\nenough - a condition that will depend on short-length\nscale physics in addition to the mesoscopic resistive parameters - then it is possible that the FSC could be\nstabilized. These effects clearly need further exploration.\nFinite length wires. In the SC\u22c6 phase at zero temperature, the only low energy effects of dissipation in our\nnanowire model arise from the global k = 0 mode and\nthus depend solely on the total resistance of the wire. In\nfinite wires this would mean that at very low temperatures, when the wire acts like a single Josephson junction,\nits total resistance will determine whether it is superconducting or resistive. At higher temperatures, T > c/L,\nthe behavior of the wire could exhibit a K-T crossover\nwhich is tuned by the stiffness, or thickness, of the wire.\nWe note, however, that in finite wires the resistivity\nmay determine other parameters that are important for\nthe superconductor-to-normal transition, such as the fugacity of the QPS [24] and the strength of quantum fluctuations [93]. So the superconductor-to-normal transition in finite wires is determined by both the resistance\nand the resistivity. A more detailed discussion will be\ngiven elsewhere [70]. We should note that other effects\nmay also be important for the case of superconducting\nnanowires, such as the suppressed Tc due to Coulomb\ninteractions as in Refs. 104, 105.\nThe picture arising from our analysis conforms with\nand enhances that in Ref. 94. There it is assumed that a\nfinite nanowire is shunted externally by a resistor. This\nresistor gives rise to a zero-temperature SC-NOR transition, but the plasmon degrees of freedom in the wire\ngive rise to sharp crossovers. Our picture puts the picture of B\u00fcchler et al. [94] on firm microscopic footing by\nshowing that, quite generically, the resistivity of the wire\nneeds to be taken into account as a single resistor that\nshunts the entire length of the wire.\nExperiments on nanowires. The hypothesis that\ndissipation plays an important role in superconducting nanowires is supported by the recent experiments\nof Bezryadin et al.\n[23, 24, 86], in which the\nsuperconductor-to-normal transition was observed to depend on the normal state resistance of the wire. Later\nexperiments [24] on longer wires showed a transition that\ndepended on the resistivity of the wire, rather than its\ntotal resistance. Bollinger et al. [87] recently carried\n\n\f38\nan extensive study of shorter wires (\u223c 200nm), and\nobserved results consistent with both previous experiments. At this point it is still not clear whether the zerotemperature SC-metal transition in finite-length amorphous nanowires depends on their total resistance, or\nprimarily on the resistivity.\nCharge discreteness effects. Before turning to\nbroader implications, we briefly raise various issues. The\nmost serious caveat to our results arise from aspects of\ncharge discreteness that we have ignored. In the formalism we use, the charge discreteness not only gives the\nbasic periodicity of the superconducting phase, \u03c6, of the\nJosephson coupling, but also implies periodic boundary\nconditions modulo 2\u03c0 in the imaginary time path integral\non (0, \u03b2), e.g., in Eq. (12). We have ignored the effects of\nnon-trivial windings of the phase and thus the linear d\u03c6\nd\u03c4\nterm that only matters when \u03c6(\u03c4 + \u03b2) 6= \u03c6(\u03c4 ). These can\ncause Berry-phase-like interference effects among QPS\nthat we have ignored.\nFor single Josephson junctions, an approach to dissipation that respects charge quantization is to explicitly\nanalyze quasiparticle tunneling as carried out, for example, in Ref. 37. It is found that the quasiparticle tunneling has very similar effect to Ohmic dissipation when\nthe (continuum) electrostatic equilibrium corresponds to\nan integer number of Cooper pairs on each electrode.\nThe generalization of this to JJ chains in the absence\nof dissipation has been analyzed in Ref. 106 and others\n[107]: the simple model we use is only directly applicable when there is an integer number of Cooper pairs per\ngrain (or other commensurate filling for which the grains\ncan act in groups). At incommensurate filling factors\nthe Cooper pairs are always delocalized in the absence of\nrandomness. Hence, naively, one would expect that if the\nohmic shunt resistors are replaced by quasiparticle tunneling and motion of discrete electrons, and the conversion resistance by quasiparticle creation and annihilation\nprocesses caused by the dynamics of the superconducting\nphase, \u03c6, the conclusions of our paper would only be valid\nfor integer number of Cooper pairs per grain. This additional effect of charge discreteness, which would severely\nrestrict the applicability of our results, is most likely to\nbe problematic when the shunt and conversion resistances\nare high: this will increase phase fluctuations and result,\nin any case, in charging effects destroying the superconductivity as we have found. When the resistances are\nlow - the regime in which the FSC phase is predicted\n- it is less clear what the effects of charge discreteness\nare as the number of Cooper pairs on a grain is no longer\na good quantum number. We leave for future work this\nissue, as well as the question of whether near to, but on\nthe normal side of transitions, there is an intermediate\n- or fuller - temperature range over which our results\napply.\nThe case of effectively commensurate filling, corresponding to the coefficient of the \u2202/\u2202\u03c4 , \u00f1S = 0 is the\n\ncase in which a transition is possible even in the absence\nof dissipation.[106] From the superconducting side, this\nshould be driven by proliferation of individual QPS as\nthe absence of resistive interactions, dipoles have finite\naction, and thus will always occur as fluctuations.\nRandomness. For another issue, the effects of randomness, the above discussion is also relevant. Giamarchi\nand Schulz analyzed a strictly one-dimensional boson system with a random potential. [59] They discussed the\nimportant role of the random Berry's phase, which controls the equilibrium local density of bosons, and found a\ntransition between the superfluid and the insulating Bose\nglass phases that is driven by pinning of the density fluctuations of the superconducting phase by the random\npotential. How wires with spatially random properties\nwould behave in the presence of \"normal\" carriers and\ndissipation is unclear. A similar question arises for the\nKT-like transition predicted by Altman et al. [107] for\na commensurately filled chain of grain with random self\ncapacitance and nearest neighbor Josephson interactions.\nIn the strong randomness limit of a JJ chain with dissipation, the superconducting transition is effectively local as we have found here, but with subtle interactions\nbetween the local phase slips. With strong randomness,\nthe transition should thus be dominated by weak links on\nmany length and energy scales, and may be controlled by\nan infinite randomness quantum critical point as found\nin other random quantum systems. [108\u2013111]\nThe effects of randomness on normal carriers need also\nbe considered. Localization effects in a nanowire typically become important below the Thouless temperature\nwhich is roughly the spacing of energy levels in a segment of length such that its total resistance is of order\nRQ . Simple estimates of this for a JJ chain suggest this\ntemperature is of the same order as T \u2217 up to factors of\nR/RQ - which make the Thouless temperature much\nlower when this factor is small, i.e., strong dissipation.\nBut with a system like that of Fig. 13, the tunneling barriers between the grains and the normal nanowire both\nplay roles: in this situation, the conversion resistance, r\nwill be large, and the Thouless temperature is likely to be\nwell below T \u2217 . Near transitions to superconductivity, the\nsuperconducting fluctuations will affect the normal electron transport and any possible localization. As these\ndecrease the overall resistance, it is likely that they also\nlower the Thouless temperature - perhaps all the way\nto zero at the transition. This argument is supported\nby the results of Giamarchi and Schulz: the SC\u22c6 phase\nis stable to randomness if its stiffness parameter, K, is\nsufficiently large. These, and other issues, surely merit\nexploring: the interplay between superconductivity and\nrandomness is still largely an open field.\nHigher Dimensions. Finally, we briefly discuss the\nimplications of our results for thin films and bulk materials. The percolation picture of the superconducting to normal transition in two and three dimensional\n\n\f39\nsystems of grains, [10, 39] suggests that close to the\ntransition the conductivity will be determined primarily by quasi-one-dimensional percolation paths. This,\nand the local effects of dissipation on each junction, suggest that many of the effects that we study here for onedimensional systems should apply to transitions in granular systems more generally. These effects may lead to\nvarious interesting crossovers, including the possibility of\nnon-monotonic temperature dependence of the resistivity (see also Ref. [58]) and quasi-metallic behavior near\nto putative superconducting-insulator transitions as observed in a variety of systems. [14, 112, 113] One of the\nmost intriguing (and poorly understood) features of such\ntransitions in thin films is the existence of a \"supermetallic phase\" characterized by a small but apparently weakly\ntemperature resistivity down to very low temperatures -\nextrapolating, it appears, to zero-temperature. [62] This\nbehavior is in striking contrast with the theoretical picture of the superconductor to insulator transition in two\ndimensional systems presented in Refs. [81, 106, 114\u2013\n117]. In this, the resistivity in the limit of low temper-\n\natures should go to either zero or infinity. The origin of\nthe observed metallic behavior in thin films is still unclear, although several groups have recently addressed\nthis problem [16, 61, 118\u2013120]. A possible origin of such\na 'supermetallic phase' in thin films are the percolation\naspects of the transition combined with effects analogous\nto those that we have discussed in this paper. In particular, these should be significant when, near the transition,\nthere are many low energy excitations that give rise to\ndissipation.\nWe note that after this paper was complete, Ref. 121,\nwhich analyzes a similar problem with similar methods\nappeared online.\nAcknowledgments It is a pleasure to thank A.\nBezryadin, M.P.A.

Together with these two terms, the third, complicated looking,\nterm, with coefficient F (k, \u03c9), gives rise to the two fluid behavior. It is from the frequency dependence of F that the\nbasic energy scale\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\nh\u0304\n(A5)\n+\nT\u2217 =\nCN S r\nR\narises. The low energy regime of interest is \u03c9 \u226a T \u2217 . Note that because of the local nature of some of the important\nphysics, we must take the low frequency limit at fixed k; if the limit is taken in the opposite order, the results can be\nvery misleading.\nAt low energies, the action becomes\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\nZ\n1\na\n2 \u2212 2 cos(ka)\nd\u03c9\ndk\n2\n2\nSchain = SJ +\nC\u0303 |VSC (k, \u03c9)| +\n,\n(A6)\n|VSC (k, \u03c9)|\n2\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n|\u03c9| R + r[2 \u2212 2 cos(ka)]\nwhich, on approximating C\u0303 by C, is the form of the action we use in both the strong and weak coupling limits.\nIn the weak coupling limit, we drop the capacitative term as this is unimportant at low frequencies.\nIn the strong coupling limit, the capacitative term is important and the Villain approximation for the Josephson\ncoupling and ensuing transformations can be carried out straightforwardly as discussed in Sec. III A. In general, this\nis only appropriate for low energies, in particular for \u03c9 \u226a \u03a9LR , the inductive relaxation rate\n\u03a9LR =\n\n\u0012\n\n2e\nh\u0304\n\n\u00132\n\nEJ R,\n\n(A7)\n\n\u0001\nh\u0304 2 1\nsince EJ is inversely proportional to the \"kinetic inductance\", LJ = 2e\nEJ of the junction. Note that \u03a9LR is the\nsame order as the plasma frequency of the junctions, reduced from this by a factor of KR/RQ which is of order unity\nin most of the regimes of interest. Thus the Villain approximation is valid wherever we have used it.\nThe action in terms of phase slips, the interactions between them, and the equivalent sine-Gordon representation in\nterms of the dual fields \u03b8 and \u03c8 can be derived straightforwardly. Note that we could have gone more directly to the\nsine-Gordon representation by decoupling the inter-grain terms in Eq. (A1) with the fields \u03c8 and \u03b8, then integrating\nout VN and \u03c6. The periodicity of \u03c6 then gives rise to an integer constraint on (\u03b8 + \u03c8)/2\u03c0 which after integrating\nout the high energy fluctuations, becomes the cos(\u03b8 + \u03c8) in the sine-Gordon action. The appropriate low frequency\napproximations appear naturally in the intermediate representation. In particular, the quadratic coupling between \u03b8\nand \u03c8 that appears if this route is followed, is unimportant at low frequencies.\n\n[1] C. P.
