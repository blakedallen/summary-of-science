While they seem to have been originally introduced\nin the '50s and '60s [5], in the framework of Dirac operators and K \u2013theory [8],\nthe revival of interest in Spin c \u2013structures over the last decade is certainly due\nto symplectic geometry and Seiberg\u2013Witten invariants of 4\u2013manifolds. For a\ngeneral introduction to Spin c \u2013structures, the reader is referred to [8]. It was\nobserved somewhat more recently [16] that, in dimension 3, Spin c \u2013structures\nhave a simple and natural interpretation: any Spin c \u2013structure on a closed oriented 3\u2013manifold M can be represented by a nowhere vanishing vector field\non M . This enabled Turaev to reinterpret a topological invariant of Euler\nstructures on 3\u2013manifolds, which he had introduced earlier, as an invariant\nof Spin c \u2013structures. Since this invariant is a refinement of the Reidemeister\ntorsion, we call this invariant the Reidemeister\u2013Turaev torsion.\nWe will be interested in the restriction of this invariant to the class of rational\nhomology 3\u2013spheres. Our work is motivated by and based on two observations.\n- On the one hand, there is the following special feature of the Reidemeister\u2013\nTuraev torsion \u03c4M,\u03c3 of an oriented rational homology 3\u2013sphere M with\na Spin c \u2013structure \u03c3 : its reduction modulo 1 induces a quadratic function\nqM,\u03c3 over the linking pairing \u03bbM [19].\n- On the other hand, there is a canonical bijective correspondence, denoted\nby \u03c3 7\u2192 \u03c6M,\u03c3 , between Spin c \u2013structures on M and quadratic functions\nover the linking pairing \u03bbM [10, 4, 2]. The quadratic function \u03c6M,\u03c3 can be\ndefined, extrinsically, using the intersection pairing of a compact oriented\n4\u2013manifold with boundary M and first Betti number equal to zero.\nThus, the question naturally arises to compare the quadratic functions qM,\u03c3\nand \u03c6M,\u03c3 .\n\n1.2\n\nStatement of the result\n\nLet us begin by developing the above two observations and fixing some notations.\nThe Reidemeister\u2013Turaev torsion of a closed oriented 3\u2013manifold equipped with\na Spin c \u2013structure is a fundamental topological invariant. A concise and almost\nGeometry & Topology, Volume 7 (2003)\n\n\fReidemeister\u2013Turaev torsion modulo one\n\n775\n\nself-contained introduction is [14]. A broader introduction is [17], while the\nmonographs [11, 19] contain the most recent developments. We give here a\nsuccinct presentation sufficient for our purpose.\nLet M be a connected oriented 3\u2013manifold, compact without boundary. All\nhomology and cohomology groups will be with integral coefficients unless explicity stated otherwise. We set H = H1 (M ), the first homology group, written\nmultiplicatively. Let Q(H) denote the classical ring of fractions of the group\nring Z[H]. The maximal Abelian Reidemeister torsion \u03c4 (M ) of M is an element in Q(H) defined up to multiplication by an element of \u00b1H \u2282 Q(H). This\ninvariant, defined in [13], can be thought of as a generalization of the Alexander\npolynomial. Next, its indeterminacy in \u00b1H can be disposed of by specifying\ntwo extra structures: a homology orientation of M and an Euler structure of\nM (see [15]). On the one hand, using the intersection pairing, the choosen orientation of M induces a canonical homology orientation. On the other hand,\nthe Euler structures on M , defined as punctured homotopy classes of nowhere\nvanishing vector fields on M , are in canonical bijective correspondence with\nthe Spin c \u2013structures on M [16]. Therefore, if (M, \u03c3) is a connected closed\nSpin c \u2013manifold of dimension 3, one can define its Reidemeister\u2013Turaev torsion\n\u03c4 (M, \u03c3) \u2208 Q(H).\nIt has the following equivariance property:\n\u2200h \u2208 H,\n\nh * \u03c4 (M, \u03c3) = \u03c4 (M, h * \u03c3) \u2208 Q(H).\n\n(1.1)\n\nHere, the left hand side involves a multiplication in Q(H) while, in the right\nhand side, h * \u03c3 involves the free and transitive action of H 2 (M ) (or H1 (M )\nvia Poincar\u00e9 duality) on the set Spin c(M ): see, eg, [8].\nNow and throughout the paper, we assume that M is an oriented rational\nhomology 3\u2013sphere, ie, we suppose that\n\u0001\nH\u2217 (M ; Q) = H\u2217 S3 ; Q .\n\nThen H is finite and Q(H) = Q[H]. Hence \u03c4 (M, \u03c3) determines a function\n\u03c4\u03c3 : H \u2192 Q such that\nX\n\u03c4 (M, \u03c3) =\n\u03c4\u03c3 (h) * h \u2208 Q[H].\nh\u2208H\n\nIt has been proved in [16, Theorem 4.3.1] that the modulo 1 reduction of the\nfunction \u03c4\u03c3 satisfies the property that\n\u2200h1 , h2 \u2208 H,\n\n\u03c4\u03c3 (h1 h2 )\u2212 \u03c4\u03c3 (h1 )\u2212 \u03c4\u03c3 (h2 )+ \u03c4\u03c3 (1) = \u2212\u03bbM (h1 , h2 ) mod 1. (1.2)\n\nGeometry & Topology, Volume 7 (2003)\n\n\fFlorian Deloup and Gw\u00e9na\u00ebl Massuyeau\n\n776\n\nHere, \u03bbM : H \u00d7H \u2192 Q/Z denotes the linking pairing of M : this is a symmetric\nnondegenerate bilinear pairing, which gives partial information on the way knots\nare linked in the manifold M [12]. It immediately follows from (1.2) that\n\u0001\n\u2200h \u2208 H, \u03c4\u03c3 (h) = \u03c4\u03c3 (1) \u2212 qM,\u03c3 h\u22121 mod 1,\n\nwhere qM,\u03c3 is a quadratic function over the linking pairing \u03bbM , in the sense\nthat it satisfies the following property:\n\u2200h, k \u2208 H, qM,\u03c3 (hk) \u2212 qM,\u03c3 (h) \u2212 qM,\u03c3 (k) = \u03bbM (h, k).\n\nIt is also easily seen from (1.1) and (1.2) that\n\u2200h \u2208 H,\n\nqM,h*\u03c3 = qM,\u03c3 + \u03bbM (h, \u2212) .\n\n(1.3)\n\nThis equation suggests to define the following free transitive action of the group\nH on the set Quad(\u03bbM ) of quadratic functions over \u03bbM :\nH \u00d7 Quad(\u03bbM ) \u2192 Quad(\u03bbM ), (h, q) 7\u2192 h * q\nwhere\n\u2200x \u2208 H, (h * q)(x) = q(x) + \u03bbM (h, x) .\nOn the other hand, it is known [10, 4, 2] (see [3] for arbitrary closed oriented\n3\u2013manifolds) how to define another bijective H \u2013equivariant correspondence\nSpinc (M ) \u2192 Quad(\u03bbM ), \u03c3 7\u2192 \u03c6M,\u03c3 .\nThis map is defined combinatorially, starting from a surgery presentation of the\nmanifold M and using its linking matrix. (The detailed construction will be\nrecalled in subsection 2.4.)\nTheorem For any oriented rational homology 3\u2013sphere M equipped with a\nSpin c \u2013structure \u03c3 , the quadratic functions qM,\u03c3 and \u03c6M,\u03c3 are equal.\nIn his monograph [11], Nicolaescu has proved the same result, with an analytic\nproof based on the connection between the Reidemeister\u2013Turaev torsion and the\nSeiberg\u2013Witten invariant. Our proof is combinatorial and purely topological.\nA surgery presentation of M provides two combinatorial descriptions of Spin c \u2013\nstructures on M . One description (called charges) is defined by Turaev in [18]\nin terms of the complement in S3 of the framed surgery link, and is used there\nto compute \u03c4 (M, \u03c3). Another description (called Chern vectors) relies on the\n4\u2013manifold with boundary M associated to the surgery presentation, and is\nwell suited for the computation of \u03c6M,\u03c3 . Our main contribution consists in\ncomparing those two descriptions of Spin c \u2013structures.\nBefore going into the proof of the Theorem, let us discuss the following immediate consequence.\nGeometry & Topology, Volume 7 (2003)\n\n\fReidemeister\u2013Turaev torsion modulo one\n\nCorollary\n\n777\n\nThe quadratic function \u03c6M,\u03c3 is determined by \u03c4 (M, \u03c3) mod 1.\n\nWe claim that the converse of the Corollary does not hold. To justify this,\ndefine the \"constant\"\nc\u03c3 = \u03c4\u03c3 (1) mod 1.\nFrom (1.1), we obtain that\n\u2200h \u2208 H,\n\nch*\u03c3 = c\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c6M,\u03c3 (h) .\n\n(1.4)\n\nLet also d\u03c3 \u2208 R/Z be such that\nX\n1\nexp (2i\u03c0 d\u03c3 ) = p\n*\nexp (2i\u03c0 \u03c6M,\u03c3 (x)) \u2208 C.\n|H| x\u2208H\n\nSince \u03c6M,\u03c3 is nondegenerate, the Gauss sum on the right hand side is wellknown to be a complex number of modulus 1. It can also be proved that\nd\u03c3 \u2208 Q/Z . Observe that\ndh*\u03c3 = d\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c6M,\u03c3 (h) .\n\n(1.5)\n\nAs an immediate consequence of (1.4) and (1.5), we obtain the following\nProposition The number c(M ) = c\u03c3 \u2212 d\u03c3 \u2208 Q/Z is a topological invariant\nof the oriented rational homology 3\u2013sphere M .\nExplicit computations can be performed on the lens spaces. For instance, we\nfind that 8c (L(7, 1)) = 3/7 6= 2/7 = 8c (L(7, 2)); since L(7, 1) and L(7, 2) have\nisomorphic linking pairings, we deduce that c(M ) can not be computed from\n\u03c6M,\u03c3 .\nIt is not difficult to verify that c(M ) is additive under connected sums, vanishes\nif M is an integer homology 3\u2013sphere and changes sign when the orientation\nof M is reversed.

The heart of this section is devoted to the presentation of two equivalent,\nbut distinct, combinatorial descriptions of complex spin structures on M . The\nproof of this equivalence will be given in Section 3. Even though we shall not\nneed it, note that subsections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 are valid for any closed oriented\nconnected 3\u2013manifold (ie, with arbitrary first Betti number).\nAs a convention, boundaries of oriented manifolds will be always given orientation by the \"outward normal vector first\" rule.\n\n2.1\n\nSurgery presentation\n\nIn this paragraph and throughout Section 2, we fix an ordered oriented framed\nn\u2013component link L in S3 , such that the oriented 3\u2013manifold VL obtained\nfrom S3 by surgery along L is diffeomorphic to our oriented rational homology\n3\u2013sphere M .\nLet bij = lkS3 (Li , Lj ) for all 1 \u2264 i 6= j \u2264 n, and let bii be the framing number\nof Li for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. We denote by BL = (bij )i,j=1,...,n the linking matrix of\nL in S3 . We also denote by WL the trace of the surgery.

Also, H 2 (WL ) will be identified with\nHom(H2 (WL ), Z) by Kronecker evaluation, and will be given the dual basis.\nNote that the matrix of the intersection pairing \u2022 : H2 (WL ) \u00d7 H2 (WL ) \u2192 Z\nrelatively to the preferred basis of H2 (WL ) is BL .\nGeometry & Topology, Volume 7 (2003)\n\n\fReidemeister\u2013Turaev torsion modulo one\n\n779\nD2 \u00d7 0\n\nLi\n\n\u0001\n\ni\n\nLi\n\u2212\u03a3i\n\nFigure 2.1: The preferred basis of H2 (WL )\n\n2.2\n\nChern vectors\n\nWe define the set of Chern vectors (associated to the link L) to be\n\u1e7cL = {s = (si )ni=1 \u2208 Zn : \u2200i = 1, . . . , n, si \u2261 bii mod 2} .\n\u1e7cL\n.

A solid torus Z is said\nto be directed when its core is oriented. We direct the solid torus Zj in the\nfollowing way: we denote by mj \u2282 E the meridian of Lj which is oriented so\nthat lkS3 (mj , Lj ) = +1, and we require the oriented core of Zj to be isotopic\nin VL to mj .\nIn general, let N be a compact oriented 3\u2013manifold with boundary \u2202N endowed, this time, with a Spin\u2013structure \u03c3 . There is a well-defined set of\nSpin c \u2013structures on N relative to \u03c3 , denoted by Spinc (N, \u03c3). The Abelian\ngroup H 2 (N, \u2202N ) acts freely and transitively on Spinc (N, \u03c3). Also, there is a\nChern class map\nc : Spinc (N, \u03c3) \u2192 H 2 (N, \u2202N )\nwhich is affine over the square map (where H 2 (N, \u2202N ) is written multiplicatively). For details about relative Spin c \u2013structures and their gluings, see [3].\nThe torus S1 \u00d7 S1 has a canonical Spin\u2013structure \u03c3 0 , which is induced by its\nLie group structure. Hence \u2202E can be endowed with a distinguished Spin\u2013\nstructure, which is denoted by \u222ani=1 \u03c3 0 . A directed solid torus Z has a distinguished Spin c \u2013structure relative to the canonical Spin\u2013structure \u03c3 0 on \u2202Z :\nthis is the one whose Chern class is Poincar\u00e9 dual to the opposite of the oriented\ncore of Z . Hence by gluing any Spin c \u2013structure on E relative to \u222ani=1 \u03c3 0 to\nthe distinguished relative Spin c \u2013structures on the directed solid tori Zj 's, we\ndefine a map\n\u0001\ng : Spinc E, \u222ani=1 \u03c3 0 \u2192 Spinc (VL ).\nThis map g is affine, via the Poincar\u00e9 duality isomorphisms P : H1 (E) \u2192\nH 2 (E, \u2202E) and P : H1 (VL ) \u2192 H 2 (VL ), over the natural inclusion homomorphism H1 (E) \u2192 H1 (VL ). In particular, g is onto.\n\nGeometry & Topology, Volume 7 (2003)\n\n\fReidemeister\u2013Turaev torsion modulo one\n\n781\n\nAnother useful general fact is that the Chern class c(\u03b1) of a Spin c \u2013structure\n\u03b1 relative to a Spin\u2013structure on the boundary has a nice explicit expression\nmodulo 2, which we briefly explain. Let S be a closed oriented surface. Denote\nby Quad(S) the set of quadratic functions over the mod 2 intersection pairing\nof S . Hence, an element q \u2208 Quad(S) is a map q : H1 (S; Z2 ) \u2192 Z2 such that\nq(x + y) \u2212 q(x) \u2212 q(y) = x \u2022 y for all x, y \u2208 H1 (S; Z2 ), where \u2022 denotes the mod\n2 intersection pairing. The Atiyah-Johnson correspondence [1, 6] is a bijective\nH1 (S, Z2 )\u2013equivariant map\nJ : Spin(S) \u2192 Quad(S), \u03c3 7\u2192 J\u03c3 .\nHere, the function J\u03c3 is defined, for any simple oriented closed curve \u03b3 , by\nJ\u03c3 ([\u03b3]) = 1 or 0 according to whether (\u03b3, \u03c3|\u03b3 ) is homotopic to S1 with the\nSpin\u2013structure induced from the Lie group structure or not [7, pages 35\u201336].\nLemma 2.1 (See [3]) Let N be a compact oriented 3\u2013manifold with boundary, \u03c3 \u2208 Spin(\u2202N ) and \u03b1 \u2208 Spinc (N, \u03c3). Then\n\u2200y \u2208 H2 (N, \u2202N ),\n\nhc(\u03b1), yi \u2261 J\u03c3 (\u2202\u2217 (y)) mod 2,\n\nwhere h*, *i denotes Kronecker evaluation, and where \u2202\u2217 : H2 (N, \u2202N ) \u2192 H1 (\u2202N )\nis the connecting homomorphism of the pair (N, \u2202N ).\n\u0001\nA canonical bijection between Spinc E, \u222ani=1\u0001\u03c3 0 and C \u0303L can be defined in the\nfollowing way: for any \u03b1 \u2208 Spinc E, \u222ani=1 \u03c3 0 , calculate P \u22121 c(\u03b1) \u2208 H1 (E) and\nidentify H1 (E) with Zn taking the meridians ([m1 ], . . . , [mn ]) as a basis; it is a\nconsequence of Lemma 2.1 that the multi-integer we obtain is actually a charge\non L. Thus, since g is surjective and since Ker (H1 (E) \u2192 H1 (VL )) is generated\nby the n characteristic curves of the surgery, it follows that the map g induces\na bijection\nC \u0303L\n\u2192 Spinc (VL )\n2 * Im BL\nas claimed.\n\n2.4\n\nThe quadratic function \u03c6M,\u03c3\n\nIn this paragraph, we recall how to compute the quadratic function \u03c6M,\u03c3\n[10, 4, 2] from the surgery presentation L for M and a Chern vector s \u2208 Zn\nrepresenting \u03c3 \u2208 Spinc (M ).

In the previous section, we computed\n\u03c6M,\u03c3 from a surgery presentation of M and a Chern vector representing \u03c3 .\nThus, the proof consists in two steps: 1. compare charges to Chern vectors\n(there must be a bijective correspondence between them); 2. compare qM,\u03c3 to\n\u03c6M,\u03c3 using surgery presentations.\nWe shall use the notations of the previous section. In particular, we have fixed\nan ordered oriented framed n\u2013component link L in S3 , such that the oriented\n3\u2013manifold VL obtained by surgery along L is diffeomorphic to our oriented\nrational homology 3\u2013sphere M .\nThe comparison of the two combinatorial descriptions of Spin c (VL ) is contained\nin the following\nClaim 3.1 If \u03c3 \u2208 Spinc (VL ) corresponds to [k] \u2208 CL , then \u03c3 corresponds to\n[s] \u2208 VL , where\n\u2200j \u2208 {1, . . . , n},\n\nsj = 1 \u2212 kj +\n\nn\nX\n\nbij .\n\n(3.1)\n\ni=1\n\nRemark 3.2 Claim 3.1 is true for any closed oriented connected 3\u2013manifold\n(ie, with arbitrary first Betti number).\n\nGeometry & Topology, Volume 7 (2003)\n\n\fReidemeister\u2013Turaev torsion modulo one\n\n783\n\nj \u2013th handle\n\ni\u2013th handle\n\nDj\n\nS3\nS3\n\u03bbj\nAj\n\n(lj )\u03b5\n\n\u2212\u03a3cut\nj\n\n\u0001\n\n\u03b5\n\n\u0001\n\n\u03b5\n\none of the (\u2212Rjl )\u03b5 's\n\nFigure 3.1: A decomposition of the surface Sj\nc\nProof of the Claim\n\u0011 by \u03c32 the distinguished relative Spin \u2013\n\u0010 3.1 We denote\nc\nc\nn\n0\nn\nn\n0\nstructure in Spin \u222aj=1 Zj , \u222aj=1 \u03c3 .

Set\n\u03c3 \u2032 = \u03c3#\u03c31 # * * * #\u03c3r \u2208 Spinc (M \u2032 ) where \u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3r denote arbitrary Spin c \u2013\nstructures on the lens spaces. Then, we have qM \u2032 ,\u03c3\u2032 = \u03c6M \u2032 ,\u03c3\u2032 . By definition of\n#, there is a small 3\u2013ball B \u2282 M such that M \\B \u2282 M \u2032 . This inclusion induces\na (injective) homomorphism i\u2217 : H1 (M ) \u2192 H1 (M \u2032 ). Since we can compute\n\u03c6M \u2032 ,\u03c3\u2032 from a split surgery presentation of M \u2032 using the surgery formula (2.4),\nwe have that \u03c6M,\u03c3 = \u03c6M \u2032 ,\u03c3\u2032 \u25e6 i\u2217 . It follows from [19, Chapter XII, Section 1.2]\n(which describes the behaviour of the Reidemeister\u2013Turaev torsion under #)\nthat, similarly, qM,\u03c3 = qM \u2032 ,\u03c3\u2032 \u25e6 i\u2217 . We deduce that qM,\u03c3 = \u03c6M,\u03c3 and we are\ndone.\n\nReferences\n[1] M F Atiyah, Riemann surfaces and spin structures, Ann. Sci. Ec. Norm.
