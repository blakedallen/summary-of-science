INTRODUCTION\nTraditionally two apparently separate approaches have been used to model a continuous medium.\nThe first is the continuum theory, in the form of partial differential equations describing the conservation laws and constitutive relations. This approach has been impressively successful in a number\nof areas such as solid and fluid mechanics. It is very efficient, simple and often involves very few material parameters. But it becomes inaccurate for problems in which the detailed atomistic processes\naffect the macroscopic behavior of the medium, or when the scale of the medium is small enough\nthat the continuum approximation becomes questionable. Such situations are often found in studies\nof properties and defects of micro- or nano- systems and devices. The second approach is atomistic,\naiming at finding the detailed behavior of each individual atom using molecular dynamics or quantum\nmechanics. This approach can in principle accurately model the underlying physical processes. But\nit is often times prohibitively expensive.\nRecently an alternative approach has been explored that couples the atomistic and continuum\napproaches [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The main idea is to use atomistic modeling at places where the\ndisplacement field varies on an atomic scale, and the continuum approach elsewhere. The most\nsuccessful and best-known implementation is the quasi-continuum method [1, 2] which combines the\nadaptive finite element procedure with an atomistic evaluation of the potential energy of the system.\nThis method has been applied to a number of examples [8, 9, 10], and interesting details were learned\nabout the structure of crystal defects.\nExtension of the quasi-continuum method to dynamic problems has not been straightforward\n[5, 6, 7]. The main difficulty lies in the proper matching between the atomistic and continuum regions.\nSince the details of lattice vibrations, the phonons, which are an intrinsic part of the atomistic model,\ncannot be represented at the continuum level, conditions must be met that the phonons are not\nreflected at the atomistic-continuum interface. Since the atomistic region is expected to be a very\nsmall part of the computational domain, violation of this condition quickly leads to local heating of\nthe atomistic region and destroys the simulation. In addition, the matching between the atomistic-\n\n3\n\n\fcontinuum interface has to be such that large scale information is accurately transmitted in both\ndirections.\nThe main purpose of the present paper is to introduce a new class of matching conditions between\natomistic and continuum regions. These matching conditions have the property that they allow\naccurate passage of large scale (scales that are represented by the continuum model) information\nbetween the atomistic and continuum regions and no reflection of phonon energy to the atomistic\nregion. These conditions can also be used in pure molecular dynamics simulations as the border\nconditions to ensure no reflection of phonons at the boundary of the simulation. As applications,\nwe use our method to study the dynamics of dislocations in the Frenkel-Kontorova model, friction\nbetween crystal surfaces and crack propagation.\n\n2. CONTINUUM APPROXIMATION OF ATOMISTIC MODELS\nAs a first step toward constructing a coupled atomistic-continuum method, we discuss briefly how\ncontinuum equations are obtained from atomistic models.\n\n2.1.\n\n1D Frenkel-Kontorova Model - the Klein-Gordan Equation\n\nWe first consider a simple problem, the Frenkel-Kontorova Model. This is a one-dimensional chain\nof particles in a periodic potential, coupled by springs. We will take the potential to be:\nU (x) =\n\n1\nK(x \u2212 a int(x/a))2\n2\n\n(2.1)\n\nHere a is the equilibrium distance between neighboring particles, int(x/a) is the integer part of x/a.\nDenote by xn the position of the n\u2212th particle, the dynamic equation for the particles is given by\nm\u1e8dn = k[xn+1 \u2212 xn \u2212 a] + k[xn\u22121 \u2212 xn + a] \u2212 U \u2032 (xn ) + f.\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere f is the applied force.\nOne interesting aspect of the Frenkel-Kontorova model is the possibility of having dislocations\nin the system, which corresponds to vacant or doubly occupied potential wells. In the absence of\ndislocations, the equilibrium positions of the particles are given by xj = ja. In general, we let\n4\n\n\fxj = a(j + uj ) and fe = f /a. u is then the displacement field. A dislocation corresponds to a kink in\n\nu. Far from the dislocations, we can assume |uj \u2212 [uj ]| \u226a 1 where [u] is the integer part of u. Then\nwe get, assuming [uj ] = 0,\nm\u00fcj = k[uj+1 \u2212 2uj + uj\u22121 ] \u2212 Kuj + fe.\n\np\nLet \u03c4 = t m/(ka2 ), K\u0304 = K/(ka2 ), and f \u0304 = fe/(ka2 ), we obtain:\n\n\u2202 2 uj\n= uj+1 \u2212 2uj + uj\u22121 \u2212 K\u0304uj + f \u0304.\n\u2202\u03c4 2\n\n(2.3)\n\n(2.4)\n\nTaking the limit as a \u2192 0, we obtain the continuum limit equation for the displacement field u,\n\u22022u\n\u2202 2u\n=\n\u2212 K\u0304u + f \u0304.\n\u2202\u03c4 2\n\u2202x2\n\n(2.5)\n\nThis is simply the Klein-Gordan equation.\n\n2.2.\n\n2D Triangular Lattice - Isotropic Elasticity\n\nNow we consider the triangular lattice model. We assume that nearest neighbor atoms interact\nvia central forces whose potential is given by \u03a6(r2 ) where r is the distance between the atoms (see\nFigure 1). From Newton's law, we have\nmr\u03080 = \u2212\n\nX\nj\n\n\u2207r0,j \u03a6(|r0,j |2 ),\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhere m is the mass of the atoms, rj is the position of the j-th atom (j = (j1 , j2 )), r0,j = r0 \u2212 rj .\nLet {Rj } be the equilibrium positions of the atoms.

In the 1D\ncase, one can view it as a model for the atoms lying along a crack surface. Nearest neighbors are\nconnected by elastic springs, with spring constant k, and the atoms are tied to the other side of the\ncrack surface by similar springs, which however snap when extended past some breaking point. The\nlines of atoms are being pulled apart by weak springs of spring constant k/N . These weak springs\nare meant schematically to represent N vertical rows of atoms pulling in series. Let {uj,+ , uj,\u2212 } be\nthe displacement of atoms on the top and bottom crack surfaces respectively. The equation which\n\n6\n\n\fdescribes the upper line of mass points in this model is\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nk(uj+1,+ \u2212 2uj,+ + uj\u22121,+ )\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 + k (UN \u2212 uj,+ )\nN\nm\u00fcj,+ =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n+k(uj,\u2212 \u2212 uj,+ )\u03b8(2uf \u2212 |uj,\u2212 \u2212 uj,+ |)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u2212bu\u0307j,+\n\n(2.11)\n\nHere, the first term at the right hand side is elastic coupling to neighbors, the second term is the\ndriving force by displacing edges of the strip, the third term is the bonding to atoms at the opposite\nside of the crack surface, the last term is the dissipation, \u03b8 is a step function, and the term containing\n\nit describes bonds which snap when their total extension reaches a distance 2uf , where uf is a fracture\ndistance. Assume the lattice constant is a. In the region far away from the fracture, we have\nm\u00fcj,+ = k(uj+1,+ \u2212 2uj,+ + uj\u22121,+ ) +\n\nk\n(UN \u2212 uj,+ ) + k(uj,\u2212 \u2212 uj,+ ) \u2212 bu\u0307j,+\nN\n\n(2.12)\n\nDividing by a2 and taking the limit as a \u2192 0, we obtain\n\nwith \u03c4 = t\n\np\nm/(ka2 ), eb = b/(ka).\n\n\u2202 2 u e \u2202u\n\u22022u\n=\n\u2212b\n\u2202\u03c4 2\n\u2202x2\n\u2202\u03c4\n\n(2.13)\n\nNow we consider a simple 2D model (see Figure 2). A crack moves in a lattice strip composed of\n2N rows of mass points. Assume that all the atoms are located at square lattice points if there is no\nexterior force on them. All of the bonds between lattice points are brittle-elastic, behaving as perfect\nlinear springs until the instant they snap, from which point they exert no force. The displacement\nof each mass point is described by a single spatial coordinate ui,j , which can be interpreted as the\nheight of mass point (i, j) into or out of the page. The index i takes integer values, while j =\n1/2 \u2212 N, * * * , \u22121/2, 1/2, * * * , N \u2212 1/2. The model is described by the equation\nm\u00fci,j = \u2212bu\u0307i,j +\n\nX\n\nF (ui\u2032 ,j \u2032 \u2212 ui,j ),\n\n(2.14)\n\nnearest\nneighbors (i\u2032 , j \u2032 )\nwith\nF (r) = kr\u03b8(2uf \u2212 |r|)\n7\n\n(2.15)\n\n\frepresenting the brittle nature of the springs, \u03b8 the step function, and b the coefficient of a small\ndissipative term. The boundary condition which drives the motion of the crack is\nui,\u00b1(N \u22121/2) = \u00b1UN .\n\n(2.16)\n\nSimilarly, we can get the continuum limit of (2.14):\n\u22022u\n\u2202u\n= \u25b3u \u2212 eb .\n\u2202\u03c4 2\n\u2202\u03c4\n\n(2.17)\n\n3. PHONONS\nAmong the most essential differences between the atomistic and continuum behavior is the presence\nof phonons, the lattice vibrations, at the atomistic scale. In this section we will briefly review the\nspectrum of the phonons. Let us first consider the simplest model: 1D discrete wave equation (2.3)\nwith k = 1, K = 0 and f = 0. After discretization in time, we have\nun+1\n\u2212 2unj + ujn\u22121\nj\n= unj+1 \u2212 2unj + unj\u22121 .\n\u2206t2\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere unj is the displacement of the j-th particle at time t = n\u2206t.\nThe phonon spectrum for (3.1) is obtained by looking for solutions of the type unj = ei(n\u03c9\u2206t+j\u03be) .\nThis gives us the dispersion relation\n\u03c9\u2206t\n\u03be\n1\nsin\n= sin .\n\u2206t\n2\n2\n\n(3.2)\n\nFor the case when \u2206t = 0.01, this dispersion relation is depicted in Figure 3.

Let us look for the solutions of the type\nunj = ei(\u03be*rj \u2212n\u03c9\u2206t) U with \u03be = (\u03be1 , \u03be2 )T .

OPTIMAL LOCAL MATCHING CONDITIONS\nWe now come to the interface between the atomistic and continuum regions. As we mentioned\nearlier, designing proper matching conditions at this interface is a major challenge in such a coupled\natomistic/continuum approach. The basic requirements for the matching conditions are the following:\n(1). Reflection of phonons to the atomistic region should be minimal. This is particularly crucial\nsince the atomistic regions are typically very small for the purpose of computational efficiency, reflection of phonon energy back to the atomistic region will trigger local heating and melt the crystalline\nstructure.\n(2). Accurate exchange of large scale information between the atomistic and continuum regions.\nThe first requirement is reminiscent of the absorbing boundary conditions required for the computation of waves [12, 13]. Indeed our work draws much inspiration from that literature. There are some\ncrucial differences between the phonon problem considered here and the ones studied in the literature on absorbing boundary conditions. The most obvious one is the fact that the electromagnetic or\nacoustic waves are continuum objects modeled by partial differential equations, and the associated absorbing boundary conditions often use small wavenumber and/or frequency approximations, whereas\nthe phonons are intrinsically discrete with substantial energy distributed at high wavenumbers.\nIn the following we will give an example of a simple discrete wave equation for which exact reflectionless boundary conditions can be found. Such exact boundary conditions are highly nonlocal and\n9\n\n\ftherefore not practical. But they give us guidelines on how approximate boundary conditions should\nbe constructed. We then present a method that constructs optimal local matching conditions, given\na predetermined stencil.\n\n4.1.\n\nExact Boundary Conditions for 1D Discrete Wave Equation\n\nConsider equation (3.1). It is supposed to be solved for all integer values of j. Now let us assume\nthat we will truncate the computational domain and only compute unj for j \u2265 0. Assuming there are\nno sources of waves coming from j < 0, we still want to obtain the same solution as if the computation\nis done for all j. At j = 0, we will impose a new boundary condition to make sure that the phonons\narriving from j > 0 are not reflected back at j = 0.\nAt j = 0, we replace (3.1) by\nun0 =\n\nX\n\nak,j ujn\u2212k ,\n\na0,0 = 0.\n\n(4.1)\n\nk,j\u22650\n\nWe would like to determine the coefficients {ak,j }. For the simple problem at hand, it is possible to\nobtain analytical formulas of {ak,j } such that the imposition of (4.1) together with the solution of\n(3.1) for j > 0 reproduces exactly the solution of (3.1) if it was solved for all integer values of j, i.e.\nan exact reflectionless boundary condition can be found.\nFirst, let us consider the case of K = 0 and f = 0.

In order to do this, let us look for solutions of the type\nunj = ei(n\u03c9\u2206t+j\u03be) + R(\u03be)ei(n\u03c9\u2206t\u2212j\u03be)\n\n(4.18)\n\nwhere \u03c9 is given by (3.2). R(\u03be) is the reflection coefficient at wavenumber \u03be. Inserting (4.18) into\n(4.1), we obtain\nP\nak,j ei(j\u03be\u2212k\u03c9\u2206t) \u2212 1\nR(\u03be) = \u2212 P\nak,j e\u2212i(j\u03be+k\u03c9\u2206t) \u2212 1\n\n(4.19)\n\nThe optimal coefficients {ak,j } are obtained by\nmin\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0\n\nW (\u03be)|R(\u03be)|2 d\u03be\n\n(4.20)\n\n0\n\nsubject to the constraint\nR(0) = 0, R\u2032 (0) = 0, etc.\n\n(4.21)\n\nHere W (\u03be) is a weight function, which is chosen to be W (\u03be) = 1 in the examples below.\nCondition (4.21) guarantees that large scale information is transmitted accurately, whereas (4.20)\nguarantees that the total amount of reflection is minimized. This procedure offers a lot of flexibility.\n\n13\n\n\fFor example, instead of\n\nR\u03c0\n0\n\n|R(\u03be)|2 d\u03be, we can minimize the total reflection over certain carefully selected\n\ninterval. Another possibility is to choose the weight function to be the (empirically computed) energy\nspectrum. The coefficients {ak,j } may then change in time to reflect the change of the nature of the\nsmall scales. In practice, we found it preferable to use\nR\u03c0\n0\n\nR \u03c0\u2212\u03b4\n0\n\n|R(\u03be)|2 d\u03be with some small \u03b4, instead of\n\n|R(\u03be)|2 d\u03be, in order to minimize the influence of \u03be = \u03c0 for which we always have R(\u03c0) = 1.\nLet us look at a few examples. If in (4.1) we only keep the terms involving a1,0 and a1,1 , then\n\nimposing the condition R(0) = 0 gives\nun0 = (1 \u2212 \u2206t)u0n\u22121 + \u2206tu1n\u22121\n\n(4.22)\n\nIf instead we keep terms involving a0,1 , a1,0 and a1,1 , we can then impose both R(0) = 0 and R\u2032 (0) = 0.\nThis gives us\nun0 = u1n\u22121 +\n\n1 \u2212 \u2206t n\u22121\n(u\n\u2212 un1 )\n1 + \u2206t 0\n\n(4.23)\n\nConditions of the type (4.22) and (4.23) are intimately related to the absorbing boundary conditions\nproposed and analyzed in [12, 13] for the computation of waves. These conditions perform well for\nlow wavenumbers but are less satisfactory at high wavenumbers.\nTo improve the performance at high wavenumbers let us consider a case that include terms with\nk \u2264 2, j \u2264 3 and minimize\n\nR \u03c0\u2212\u03b4\n0\n\n|R(\u03be)|2 d\u03be (with \u03b4 = 0.125\u03c0) subject to the condition R(0) = 0, the\n\noptimal coefficients can be easily found numerically and are given by\n\uf8eb\n\n\u22122\n\n\uf8ec 1.95264 \u22127.4207 \u00d7 10\n\uf8ec\n(ak,j ) = \uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\u22120.95406 7.4904 \u00d7 10\u22122\n\n\u22121.4903 \u00d7 10\n\n1.5621 \u00d7 10\u22122\n\nIf instead we only include terms such that k \u2264 3, j \u2264 2, then\n\uf8eb\n\n\u22122\n\n1.5150 \u00d7 10\n\uf8ec 2.9524\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n(ak,j ) = \uf8ec \u22122.9065 \u22123.0741 \u00d7 10\u22122\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n0.95406 1.5624 \u00d7 10\u22122\nThe resulting reflection coefficients R are displayed in Figure 5.\n14\n\n\u22122\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(4.24)\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(4.25)\n\n\f4.3.\n\nOptimal Local Matching Conditions for Triangular Lattice\n\nThe above procedure can be easily generalized. Let us take the triangular lattice as an example,\nand the boundary to be the x-axis.

But in practice, we find it much\nmore convenient to restrict the integration over a few selected low symmetry atomic planes. In the\npresent context, it amounts to choosing special incidences where the phonons energy dominates.\nFirst, let us consider the case of normal incidence \u03b8 = 90\u25e6 . That means \u03be1 = 0.

ALGORITHMS AND IMPLEMENTATIONS\nThe basic framework of our coupled continuum/atomistic method is that of an adaptive mesh\nrefinement method [18]. The computational domain is covered by a grid that resolves the macroscopic\nfeatures of problems, such as applied forces and boundary conditions. Regions near atomistic defects such as dislocations, interfaces, cracks, impurities, etc are detected using some error estimators.\n18\n\n\fMolecular dynamics are used in these regions to compute the location and momentum of each atom,\ntogether with the averaged quantities at the macroscopic grid points. Continuum equations are used\nelsewhere. At the interface between the two regions, matching conditions discussed in the last section\nare used. Specifically, we decompose the velocity and displacement fields into a large scale part and\na small scale part. The large scale part is evolved using the values at the macroscopic grid points. In\nthe atomistic regions, these are the averaged quantities. The small scale part is computed using the\nreflectionless boundary conditions discussed above.\nOne important aspect of this method is the error estimators that are used to distinguish atomistic\nand continuum regions. The senstivity of the error estimators determines the balance between accuracy\nand efficiency. However, since there has already been a lot of work done on this specific problem\n[19, 20, 21], we will not pursue this question here further. We find it adequate in our work to use\na refinement indicator (rather than an error estimator) which is given either by an estimate of the\nstress, or a weighted average of the wavelet coefficients.\nFurther details of our method are explained through a series of examples.\n\n5.1.\n\nDislocation Dynamics in the Frenkel-Kontorova Model\n\nAs the simplest model that encompasses most of the issues in a coupled atomistic/continuum\nsimulation, we consider the Frenkel-Kontorova model\n\u1e8dj = xj+1 \u2212 2xj + xj\u22121 \u2212 U \u2032 (xj ) + f\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhere U is a periodic function with period 1, f is an external forcing. The continuum limit of this\nequation is simply the Klein-Gordan equation\nutt = uxx \u2212 Ku + f\n\n(5.2)\n\nwhere K = U \u2032\u2032 (0). We consider the case when there is a dislocation and study its dynamics under\na constant applied forcing. We use U (x) = (x \u2212 [x])2 where [x] is the integer part of x. In this\nexample we take (5.1) as our atomistic model, and (5.2) as our continuum model. For the coupled\natomistic-continuum method, we use a standard second order finite difference method for (5.2) in the\n19\n\n\fregion away from the dislocation, and we use (5.1) in the region around the dislocation. However, we\nalso place finite difference grid points in the atomistic region. At these points, the values are obtained\nthrough averaging the values from the atomistic model. At the interface between the atomistic and\ncontinuum regions, we decompose the displacement into a large scale and a small scale part. The large\nscale part is computed on the finite difference grid, using (4.25). The small scale part is computed\nusing the reflectionless boundary conditions described earlier. The interfacial position between the\nMD and continuum regions is moved adaptively according to an analysis of the wavelet coefficients\nor the local stress. The two strategies lead to similar results. Care has to be exercised in order to\nrestrict the size of the atomistic region. For example, when wavelet coefficients are used in the criteria\nto move the atomistic region, we found it more efficient to use the intermediate levels of the wavelet\ncoefficients rather than the finest level.\nWe first consider the case when a sharp transition is made between the atomistic and continuum\nregions with a 1:16 ratio for the size of the grids. Figure 7 is a comparison of the displacement and\nvelocity fields computed using the full atomistic model and the coupled atomistic/continuum model,\nwith f = 0.04. The atomistic region has 32 atoms. The full atomistic simulation has 103 . Dislocation\nappears as a kink in the displacement field. Notice that at the atomistic/continuum interface, there is\nstill substantial phonon energy which is then suppressed by the reflectionless boundary condition. No\nreflection of phonons back to the atomistic region is observed. In Figure 9, we compare the positions of\nthe dislocation as a function of time, computed using the coupled method and the detailed molecular\ndynamics. Extremely good agreement is observed.\nWe next consider a case with f = 0.02, which alone is too weak to move the dislocation, but to\nthe left of the dislocation, we add a sinusoidal wave to the initial data. The dislocation moves as a\nconsequence of the combined effect of the force and the interaction with the wave. Yet in this case\nthe same atomistic/continuum method predicts an incorrect position for the dislocation, as shown in\nFigure 8. The discrepancy seems to grow slowly in time (see Figure 10). Improving the matching\nconditions does not seem to lead to significant improvement.\nThe difference between this case and the case shown in Figure 7 is that there is substantially more\n20\n\n\fenergy at the intermediate scales. This is clearly shown in the energy spectrum that we computed\nfor the two cases but it can also be seen in Figure 8 where an appreciable amount of small scale\nwaves are present in front of the dislocation. Such intermediate scales are suppressed in a method\nthat uses a sharp transition between the atomistic and continuum regions, unless we substantially\nincrease the size of the atomistic region. We therefore consider the next alternative in which the\natomistic/continuum transition is made gradually in a 1:2 or 1:4 ratio between neighboring grids. The\nright column in Figure 8 shows the results of such a method that uses a gradual 1:2 transition. We\nsee that the correct dislocation position is now recovered.\n\n5.2.\n\nFriction between Flat and Rough Crystal Surfaces\n\nOur second example is the friction between crystal surfaces. To model this process atomistically,\nwe use standard molecular dynamics with the Lennard-Jones potential [14, 15]. First, we consider\nthe case in which the two crystals are separated by a horizontal atomically flat interface. The atoms\nin the bottom crystal are assumed to be much heavier (by a factor of 10) than the atoms on top. To\nmodel the lack of chemical bonding between the atoms in the top and bottom crystals, the interaction\nforces are reduced by a factor of 5 between atoms in the top and bottom crystals. A constant shear\nstress is applied near the top surface. We use the periodic boundary condition in the x-direction.\nFrom a physical viewpoint, one interesting issue here is how dissipation takes place. Physically\nthe kinetic energy of the small scales appears as phonons which then convert into heat and exit the\nsystem. A standard practice in modeling such a process is to add a friction term to the molecular\ndynamics in order to control the temperature of the system [14, 15]. In contrast, we ensure the proper\ndissipation of phonons to the environment by imposing the reflectionless boundary conditions for the\nphonons. The results presented below are computed using the last set of coefficient matrices presented\nat the end of Section 4.\nFrom Figure 11 we see that we indeed obtain a linear relation between the mean displacement of\nthe atoms in the top crystal as a function of time. The temperature of the system also saturates.\nAlso plotted in Figure 11 is the result of the mean displacement computed using the combined atom-\n\n21\n\n\fistic/continuum method. Here the continuum model is the linear elastic wave equation with Lame\ncoefficients computed from the Lennard-Jones potential. The agreement between the full atomistic\nand the atomistic/continuum simulation is quite satisfactory.\nNext, we study the friction between two rough crystal surfaces. The setup is the same as before,\nexcept that the initial interface between the crystals takes the form y = f (x). The numerical results\nobtained are displayed in Figure 12. In Figure 13, we plot the positions of the atoms in the top and\nbottom crystals. We see that gaps are created in the case of rough interfaces.\nIn Figure 14, we compare the force-velocity relations for both flat and rough interfaces. Again the\nagreement between the coupled method and the full atomistic method is quite good.\nIn the present problem, we used atomistic model in a narrow strip near the interface, and continuum\nmodel away from the interface. An interesting question is how wide the atomistic strip has to be.\nClearly for the purpose of computational efficiency, we want the atomistic strip to be as narrow as\npossible. On the other hand, it has to be wide enough to provide an accurate description inside\nthe boundary layer where important atomistic processes can be relaxed. There are two important\natomistic processes in the present problem. The first is the vibration of the atoms around their local\nequilibrium positions. The second is the process of moving from one local equilibrium to the next, i.e.\nsliding by one atomic distance. Clearly the second process works on longer time scale. This process\nhas to be resolved by the atomistic layer. In Figure 15, we compare the atomic positions of a column\nof atoms which were initially vertical, i.e. they had the same x-coordinates. From this picture one\ncan also estimate the strain rate. We can clearly see that if the atomistic layer does not resolve the\nphonons generated by the second process, we get inaccurate results.\n\n5.3.\n\nCrack Propagation\n\nOur third example is the Slepyan model of fracture dynamics (2.11). In our coupled atomistic/continuum method, we use full atomistic simulation (2.11) around the crack tip, and use (2.12)\nin the region far away from the crack tip. For the continuum equation, we use the displacement\nboundary condition u\u00b1 = \u00b1UN at the left boundary, and stress boundary condition\n22\n\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n\n= 0 at the\n\n\fright boundary. Figure 16 is a comparison of the fracture surface computed using the full atomistic\nmodel and the coupled atomistic/continuum method.\nNext we apply our method to the 2D Mode III fracture dynamics on a square lattice (2.14). Same\nboundary conditions as in the 1D case are used for the continuum model. For the matching conditions\nbetween the atomistic and continuum regions, we used a stencil that consists of seven points: the values\nof the three nearest grid points next to the boundary at the current and previous time steps, plus\nthe value at the boundary grid point at the previous time step. The optimization is carried out using\nangles \u03b8 = 45\u25e6 , 90\u25e6 , 135\u25e6. Figure 17 is a comparison of the fracture surface computed using the full\natomistic model and the coupled atomistic/continuum method. Comparisons of the positions of the\nfracture tip as a function of time is given in Figure 18. The results are quite satisfactory. Finally in\nFigure 19, we display the shear waves generated as a result of the crack propagation, No reflection is\nseen.\n\n6. CONCLUSION\nIn conclusion, we presented a new strategy for the matching conditions at the atomistic/continuum\ninterface in multiscale modeling of crystals. The main idea is to choose the boundary condition by\nminimizing the reflection of phonons along a few low symmetry atomic planes, subject to some accuracy constraints at low wavenumbers. These conditions are adaptive if we choose the weight functions\nin (4.20) and (4.31) to reflect the evolving nature of the small scales. They minimize the reflection\nof phonons and at the same time ensure accurate passage of large scale information. The coupled\natomistic/continuum method presented here is quite robust and works well at low temperature. At\nfinite temperature and when nonlinearity is important at large scales, a new method has to be worked\nout. This work is in progress.\nWe thank Tim Kaxiras for suggesting the problem of friction between rough interface.
