A special class of extremal solutions is indicated by asuming a\nsimple ansatz for the matrix vector W that reduces the equation of motion to the Laplace\nequation for a real scalar function.\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nAt low energies the heterotic string theory leads to an effective field theory of massless fields\nwhich describes supergravity coupled to some matter fields. In [1]\u2013[3] it was shown that when\nconsidering the toroidal compactification from D to 3 dimensions using a Kaluza\u2013Klein ansatz,\nthe resulting theory turns out to be a nonlinear \u03c3\u2013model with values in the symmetric coset\nspace SO(d + 1, d + n + 1)/S[O(d + 1) \u00d7 O(d + n + 1)]. It is well known that the theory\nof symmetric spaces provides a convenient framework for discussing and understanding the\ninternal symmetries of the \u03c3\u2013models. Later on, an alternative representation of this effective\nfield theory in terms of a couple of matrix Ernst potentials (MEP) was proposed in [4]. This\nformulation is, in fact, a matrix generalization of the nonlinear \u03c3\u2013model parametrization of the\nstationary Einstein\u2013Maxwell (EM) theory and enables us to extrapolate the results obtained\nin the EM theory to the heterotic string realm; we review this formalism in Section 2. Further\ndevelopment in this direction was achieved in [5]\u2013[6] by introducing a single rectangular matrix\npotential which transforms linearly under the action of the charging symmtery group. Several\nfamilies of solutions have been constructed making use of the analogy between both theories\n(see, for instance, [7]\u2013[10]), however, the full charge parametrized stationary axisymmetric black\nhole solution is still missing [11]. Most of the constructed solutions were obtained by making\nuse of solution generating techniques based on the symmetries of the effective theory and their\nequations of motion.\nIn the framework of this motivation we present in Section 3 a particularly symmetric formulation of the matter sector of the effective field theory of heterotic string in terms of a pair\nof matrix potentials that enter the effective action in a completely symmetric way. This fact allows us to construct new solutions for the hole theory starting from a solution for the truncated\ntheory in terms of one of the matrix potentials. We discuss as well the restrictions under which\nthis procedure can consistently take place. Subsequently we give an explicit O(d + 1, d + n + 1)\u2013\ninvariant formulation of the effective theory in terms of a matrix vector endowed with an\nO(d + 1, d + n + 1)\u2013invariant scalar product. This formulation linearizes the action of the\nO(d + 1, d + n + 1) symmetry group on the coset space O(d + 1, d + n + 1)/O[(d + 1) \u00d7 (d + n + 1)\nand open the possibility of applying a solution\u2013generating technique in order to construct new\nfamilies of solutions. We conclude this Section by choosing a simple ansatz for the matrix\nvector which reduces the equation of motion to the Laplace equation for a real scalar function\nand yields a family of extremal solutions. Finally, in Section 4 we present our conclusions and\ndiscuss on the further development and applications of this formalism.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nThe effective action and matrix Ernst potentials\n\nLet us consider the effective action of the heterotic string at tree level\nZ\n1\n1 (D)\n1 (D)I\n(D)\n(D)\nS (D) = d(D)x | G(D) | 2 e\u2212\u03c6 (R(D) +\u03c6;M \u03c6(D);M \u2212 HM N P H (D)M N P \u2212 FM N F (D)IM N ),\n(1)\n12\n4\nwhere\n1 (D)I (D)I\n(D)I\n(D)I\n(D)I\n(D)\n(D)\nFM N = \u2202M AN \u2212\u2202N AM , HM N P = \u2202M BN P \u2212 AM FN P +cycl. perms. of M, N, P.\n2\n(D)\n\n(D)\n\nHere GM N is the metric, BM N is the anti\u2013symmetric Kalb-Ramond field, \u03c6(D) is the dilaton\n(D)I\nand AM is a set of Abelian U(1) vector fields (I = 1, 2, ..., n). In the consistent critical case\nD = 10 and n = 16, but we shall leave these parameters arbitrary for the sake of generality since\nwhen d = 1 and n = 6 the matter content of the considered effective field theory corresponds\nto that of D = N = 4 supergravity, and when d = n = 1, to that of Einstein\u2013Maxwell Dilaton\u2013\nAxion theory; moreover, several cases have been considered in the literature using different\nvalues of d and n.\nIn [2]\u2013[3] it was shown that after the compactification of this model on a D \u2212 3 = d\u2013torus,\nthe resulting stationary theory possesses the SO(d + 1, d + 1 + n) symmetry group and describes\ngravity coupled to the following set of three\u2013dimensional fields:\na) scalar fields\n1\n(D)I\n(D)\n(D)\n(2)\nG \u2261 Gmn = Gm+3,n+3 , B \u2261 Bmn = Bm+3,n+3 , A \u2261 AIm = Am+3 , \u03c6 = \u03c6(D) \u2212 ln|det G|,\n2\nb)tensor fields\n\u0010\n\n(D)\n\n(D)\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n(D)\nn\nm m+d\nm+d\nmn\n, B\u03bc\u03bd = B\u03bc\u03bd\n\u22124Bmn Am\n\u2212Am\n, (3)\ng\u03bc\u03bd = e\u22122\u03c6 G(D)\n\u03bc\u03bd \u2212Gm+3,\u03bc Gn+3,\u03bd G\n\u03bc A\u03bd \u22122 A\u03bc A\u03bd\n\u03bd A\u03bc\n\n\u0010\n\nm+d\nc)vector fields A\u03bc(a) = (A1 )m\n, (A3 )2d+I\n\u03bc , (A2 )\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\n\u0011\n\n1 mn (D)\n1\n1 (D)\n1\n(A1 )m\nGn+3,\u03bc , (A3 )I+2d\n= \u2212 A\u03bc(D)I +AIn An\u03bc , (A2 )m+d\n= Bm+3,\u03bc\u2212Bmn An\u03bc + AIm AI+2d\n(4)\n\u03bc = G\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n2\n2\n2\n2\nwhere the subscripts m, n = 1, 2, ..., d; and a = 1, ..., 2d + n. Following [3], in this paper we set\nB\u03bc\u03bd = 0 in order to remove the effective cosmological constant from our consideration.\nIn three dimensions all vector fields can be dualized on\u2013shell as follows\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1 2\u03c6 \u22121\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2207u + (B + AAT )\u2207v + A\u2207s ,\n\u2207 \u00d7 A1 =\ne G\n2\n2\n1\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\ne2\u03c6 (\u2207s + AT \u2207v) + AT \u2207 \u00d7 A1 ,\n(5)\n\u2207 \u00d7 A3 =\n2\n1\n1 2\u03c6\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\ne G\u2207v \u2212 (B + AAT )\u2207 \u00d7 A1 + A\u2207 \u00d7 A3 .\n\u2207 \u00d7 A2 =\n2\n2\n3\n\n\fThus, the effective stationary theory describes gravity g\u03bc\u03bd coupled to the scalars G, B, A, \u03c6\nand pseudoscalars u, v, s. All matter fields can be arranged in the following pair of MEP\nX =\n\n\u2212e\u22122\u03c6 + v T Xv + v T As + 12 sT s v T X \u2212 uT\nXv + u + As\nX\n\n!\n\n,\n\n!\n\nsT + v T A\nA\n\nA=\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere X = G + B + 21 AAT . These matrices have dimensions (d + 1) \u00d7 (d + 1) and (d + 1) \u00d7 n,\nrespectively. Some words about the physical meaning of of the fields are in order. The relevant\ninformation of the gravitational field is encoded in X, whereas its rotational nature is hidden\nin u; \u03c6 is the dilaton field, v is related to multidimensional components of the Kalb\u2013Ramond\nfield, A and s stand for electric and magnetic potentials, respectively.\nIn terms of MEP, the effective three\u2013dimensional theory adopts the form\n3\n\nZ\n\n1\n\nS = d3 x | g | 2 {\u2212R+Tr[\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\u0010\n1\n\u2207X \u2212\u2207AAT G \u22121 \u2207X T \u2212A\u2207AT G \u22121 + \u2207AT G \u22121 \u2207A]},\n4\n2\n\nwhere X = G + B + 21 AAT , hence the matrices G =\nread\nG=\n\n\u2212e\u22122\u03c6 + v T Gv v T G\nGv\nG\n\n!\n\n,\n\nB=\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nX + X T \u2212 AAT and B =\n\n0\nv T B \u2212 uT\nBv + u\nB\n\n!\n\n.\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0010\n\n(7)\n\nX \u2212 XT\n\n\u0011\n\n(8)\n\nIn [4] it was shown that there exist a map between the stationary actions of the heterotic string\nand Einstein\u2013Maxwell theories\nX \u2190\u2192 E,\nmatrix transposition\n\nA \u2190\u2192 F,\n\n\u2190\u2192\n\ncomplex conjugation,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere E and F are the complex Ernst potentials of the Einstein\u2013Maxwell theory [12]. Thus,\nthe map (9) allows us to generalize the results obtained in the EM theory to the heterotic string\none using the MEP formulism. It is worth noticing that in the right hand side we have complex\nfunctions, whereas in the left hand side we have real matrices (hence the transposition instead\nthe complex conjugation) that obey the usual rules of matrix algebra.\n\n3\n\nSymmetric Formulations\n\nWe begin this Section by reformulating the matter sector of the three\u2013dimensional effective field\ntheory of the heterotic string (6). First we give a particularly symmetric representation of the\n4\n\n\feffective theory in terms of two potentials and then we rewrite it in an explicit O(d+1, d+n+1)\u2013\ninvariant form.\n\u221a\nThus, if we substitute X = 2(Z1 + \u03a3)\u22121 \u2212 \u03a3 and A = 2(Z1 + \u03a3)\u22121 Z2 , where Z1 and \u03a3 are\nmatrices of dimension d + 1, Z2 is a (d + 1) \u00d7 n\u2013matrix and \u03a3 = diag(\u22121, \u22121, 1, 1, ...1), the\nmatter sector of the action (7) takes the form\nSmatt =\n\nZ\n\n1\n\nh\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nd3 x | g | 2 T r \u2207Z1 \u03a3 + \u03a3Z1T \u0398\u22121 Z1 \u03a3 \u2207Z1T \u0398\u22121 + \u2207Z1 \u03a3Z1T \u0398\u22121 Z2 \u2207Z2T \u0398\u22121 +\n\u0010\n\ni\n\n\u0011\n\n\u2207Z2 Z2T \u0398\u22121 Z1 \u03a3\u2207Z1T \u0398\u22121 + \u2207Z2 In + Z2T \u0398\u22121 Z2 \u2207Z2T \u0398\u22121 ,\nor, equivalently,\nSmatt =\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\nd3 x | g | 2 T r \u0398\u22121 \u2207Zk Ykl \u2207ZlT ,\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\nwhere the symmetric block\u2013matrix reads\nYkl =\n\n\u03a3 + \u03a3Z1T \u0398\u22121 Z1 \u03a3\n\u03a3Z1T \u0398\u22121 Z2\nT \u22121\nZ2 \u0398 Z1 \u03a3\nIn + Z2T \u0398\u22121 Z2\n\n!\n\n,\n\n\u0398 = \u03a3\u2212Z1 \u03a3Z1T \u2212Z2 Z2T , In is the unit matrix of dimension n and k, l = 1, 2. The corresponding\nequations of motion for the matrix potentials Z1 and Z2 are\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u22072 Z1 + 2 \u2207Z1 \u03a3Z1T + \u2207Z2 Z2T \u0398\u22121 \u2207Z1 = 0\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n\u22072 Z2 + 2 \u2207Z1 \u03a3Z1T + \u2207Z2 Z2T \u0398\u22121 \u2207Z2 = 0\n\n(12)\n\nThis parametrization of the effective theory is a generalization of the K\u00e4hler \u03c3\u2013model representation of the stationary EM theory [13] in terms of a pair of real matrix potentials instead\nof complex functions. An important feature of this action is its evident invariance under the\ntransformation\nZ2 \u2192 Z1 \u03c4\n\n(13)\n\nif the rectangular matrix \u03c4 satisfies the following conditions\n\u03c4 \u03c4 T = \u03a3,\n\n\u03c4 T \u03a3\u03c4 = In .\n\n(14)\n\nThis symmetry mixes the gravitational and matter degrees of freedom of the theory. It\nrecalls the Bonnor transformation of the Einstein\u2013Maxwell theory [14]\u2013[15], but in the heterotic\nstring realm.\n5\n\n\fIn the particular case when \u03c4 is a square matrix, only the first restriction is sufficient to\nensure the map (13). This symmetry enables us to construct new classes of solutions for the\nwhole theory on the basis of solutions for Z1 or Z2 making use of a simple solution generating\nprocedure.\nIn principle, one can study the effective action under investigation formulated in terms of\nother dynamical variables in which the group O(d + 1, d + n + 1) acts linearly on the coset\nspace O(d + 1, d + n + 1)/O[(d + 1) \u00d7 (d + n + 1). In order to achieve this aim, let us introduce\nthe O(d + 1, d + n + 1)\u2013matrix vector W = (W1 , W2 , W3 ) 6= 0 with components defined by the\nrelations\nZ1 \u2261 (W2 )\u22121 W1 ,\n\nZ2 \u2261 (W2 )\u22121 W3 ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere W1 and W2 are (d + 1) \u00d7 (d + 1)\u2013matrices and the dimension of W3 is (d + 1) \u00d7 n. Let\nus define as well the O(d + 1, d + n + 1)\u2013invariant scalar product in the space of vectors W\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nW, WT \u2261 (W1 , W2 , W3 ) L\u0303 (W1 , W2 , W3 )T = \u2212W1 \u03a3W1 T + W2 \u03a3W2 T \u2212 W3 W3 T ,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere the matrix L\u0303 determines the indefinite signature L\u0303 = diag(\u2212\u03a3, \u03a3, \u2212In ) of the vector\nspace.\nIn terms of the introduced vector our action adopts the form\nS=\u2212\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n\u001a\n\n\u0010\n\nd3 x | g | 2 T r R + W, WT\n\u0010\n\n\u2207W, WT\n\n\u0011\u22121 \u0010\n\n\u0011\u0010\n\nW, WT\n\n\u0011\u22121 h\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u2207W, \u2207WT \u2212\n\nW, \u2207WT\n\n\u0011\u0015\u001b\n\n,\n\n(17)\n\nthe corresponding equations of motion are\nR\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212T r\n\n\u001a\u0010\n\nW, W\n\n\u0011\nT \u22121\n\n\u0014\u0010\n\n\u2207\u03bc W, \u2207\u03bd W\n\u0010\n\nT\n\n\u0011\n\n\u22072 W \u2212 2 W, \u2207WT\n\n\u0010\n\n\u2212 \u2207\u03bc W, W\n\n\u0011\u0010\n\nW, WT\n\nT\n\n\u0011\u22121\n\n\u0011\u0010\n\nW, W\n\n\u2207W = 0,\n\n\u0011\nT \u22121\n\n\u0010\n\nW, \u2207\u03bd W\n\nT\n\n\u0011\u0015\u001b\n\n,\n\n(18)\n\nwhich is nothing else that a matrix vector generalization of the Ernst equation for W.\nThis new dynamical system is related to the original one in the following sense: any solution\nof the field equations (18) can be translated into a solution of the equations of motion for\nthe original theory using the algebraic relations (15). This formulation of the theory and its\nequation of motion is explicitly O(d + 1, d + n + 1)\u2013invariant and is a direct generalization of\n6\n\n\fthe representation given in [13] and [16] in the framework of the stationary EM theory. The\nrealization of the linear action of the O(d + 1, d + n + 1) symmetry group on the coset space\nO(d + 1, d + n + 1)/O[(d + 1) \u00d7 (d + n + 1]) is reached by means of the matrix transformation\nW\u2032 = UW\n\n(19)\n\nwhere the matrix U satisfies the following condition\nU L\u0303U T = L\u0303,\n\n(20)\n\ni.e., U belongs to the O(d + 1, d + n + 1) symmetry group.\nIn the simplest case when the matrix vector W has the form\nW = \u03a8\u22121 K,\n\n(21)\n\nwhere the \u03a8 is a real scalar function and K is a constant matrix vector, the equation of motion\n(18) reduces to the Laplace equation for the function \u03a8\n\u22072 \u03a8 = 0.\n\n(22)\n\nThe general solution of this equation is well known and in the simplest case we can consider\nthe spherically symmetric solution\n\u03a8=1\u2212\n\n4\n\n2m\n.\nr\n\n(23)\n\nConclusion and discussion\n\nWe have presented a couple of symmetric formulations of the toroidally compactified stationary\nheterotic string theory. The first representation is written in terms of a pair of matrix potentials\nZ1 and Z2 that enter the effective action in a completely symmetric way, a fact that allows us\nto apply a simple solution\u2013generating procedure on the basis of either Z1 or Z2 . The second\nparametrization is expressed in terms of a matrix vector W which linearizes the action of the\nO(d + n+ 1) symmetry group on the coset space O(d + 1, d + n+ 1)/[O(d + 1) \u00d7O(d + n+ 1)] and\ncan be exploted for generating new solutions on the basis of known ones. Under the asumption\nof a simple ansatz for the matrix vector W, its equation of motion reduces to the Laplace\nequation for a real scalar function giving rise to a family of extremal solutions.\nAs a further development of this formalism we would like to address the application of\nsolution\u2013generating techniques in the framework of both formulations (Z1 , Z2 and W) in order\nto obtain and study more complicated field configurations. Another interesting issue is the\ninvestigation of the full symmetry group of the theory expressed in terms of the matrix vector\nW since it introduces one more matrix dynamical variable in the formalism.\n7\n\n\f5\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors thank Dr. O.
