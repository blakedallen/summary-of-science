The first reliable observations of\nintegrated circular polarization were made by Gilbert and Conway (1970) at 49 cm. Weiler and\nde Pater (1983) cataloged and reviewed integrated measurements of circular polarization in a\nlarge number of extra-galactic radio sources. They found no reliable measurements above 0.5%\nwith the majority of the observations . 0.1%. Jones (1988) used numerical simulations to model\nrelativistic jets in compact radio sources and found that the local fractional circular polarization\ncould be much higher than 0.5%.\nCircular polarization may be produced either as an intrinsic component of synchrotron\nradiation or by Faraday conversion of linear to circular polarization (e.g. Jones & O'Dell 1977).\nIntrinsic circular polarization is produced directly by the radiating particles and serves as a\nprobe of the magnetic field structure along the line of sight. Faraday conversion, however, is a\npropagation effect, dominated by the lower energy relativistic particles in the jet, and therefore\nserves as a probe of the low energy end of the relativistic particle distribution.\nWe present observations of parsec-scale circular polarization in four compact, extra-galactic\nradio sources. These observations were part of an ongoing program to monitor the structure and\npolarization of 12 rapidly variable compact radio sources, using the Very Long Baseline Array\n(VLBA) at \u03bb1.3 cm (22 GHz) and \u03bb2 cm (15 GHz). The circular polarization observations\npresented in this paper were made at 15 GHz. Observations were made at intervals of two months,\nand the consistency between images made at different epochs is an important check on our results.\nWe have detected circular polarization in 3C 84, PKS 0528+134, 3C 273, and 3C 279 at 15\nGHz. We find each of these sources to have local circular polarization at levels of 0.3% to 1%.\nThese observations are consistent across multiple epochs, and display changes linked with core\noutbursts in 3C 273 and 3C 279.\nTo make these observations we have devised three separate calibration and imaging techniques,\ndescribed in brief in section 3. Detailed discussion and analysis of these techniques and other issues\nimportant to the measurement of circular polarization is postponed to the appendix. The details\nof our experiments and a brief description of our calibration procedures are provided in section 2.\nSection 4 presents results on all the sources in our sample and images of four of them. We discuss\nthe reliability of our calibration in \u00a75 and the physical interpretation of our observations in \u00a76.\nOur conclusions are presented in section 7.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n2.\n\nObservational Details\n\nThe observations presented here were part of a project to monitor closely a sample of 13\nAGN at 15 and 22 GHz with the VLBA.3 The sources were observed at two month intervals\nfrom January 1996 to December 1996, for a total of 6 epochs. We present the 15 GHz circular\npolarization observations from the first 5 epochs. (Re-calibration for circular polarization of the 22\nGHz companion observations is currently in progress.) The overall data quality of the sixth epoch\nis much poorer than the previous five making reliable detection of circular polarization difficult.\nTable 1 lists the five epochs for which we present data in this paper. Table 2 is a list of the 13\nsources monitored with these observations.\nThe observations were scheduled to maximize coverage in the u-v plane. To accomplish this\ngoal, scan lengths were kept short (6.5 minutes per scan for the first two epochs and 5.5 minutes\nper scan for the remaining epochs) and frequencies were switched following every scan. In addition,\nscans of neighboring sources were heavily interleaved at the expense of some additional slew time.\nEach source received approximately 45 minutes per frequency of observation time at each epoch.\nThe data were recorded at each antenna using 1-bit sampling and were correlated at the\nVLBA correlator in Socorro, NM. The correlator output contained 2 second integrations for all\nfour cross-correlations (RR, RL, LR, LL), each with 4 IFs and 16 channels per IF. The data\nwere distributed on DAT tape to Brandeis University where they were loaded into NRAO's\nAstronomical Imaging Processing System (AIPS).\nFollowing a careful inspection of the data and supplied tables, the task UVFLG read in\nthe supplied flagging information and applied the initial edits. The parallactic angles were then\nremoved from the data with the task CLCOR. Prior to fringe fitting, the supplied pulse calibration\ninformation was applied with the task PCCOR.4 Global fringe fitting was performed with the\nAIPS task FRING, choosing a stable, central reference antenna such as Los Alamos (LA) or\nPie Town (PT). The AIPS procedure CROSSPOL then removed the multi-band delay difference\nbetween the right and left hand systems of the array. Initial amplitude calibration was from\nmeasured system temperatures and atmospheric opacity (using the tasks ANTAB and APCAL).\nA bandpass correction was then determined with the task BPASS before averaging across the\nchannels within each IF.\nFollowing a short time-scale point source5 phase calibration to increase coherence, the data\nwere averaged in time to 20 seconds and written out to the Caltech VLBI program, DIFMAP. The\n3\n\nThe National Radio Astronomy Observatory is operated by Associated Universities, Inc., under cooperative\nagreement with the National Science Foundation.\n4\n5\n\nThe only exception is epoch 1996.05, where a manual phase calibration was used to align the phases across IF.\n\nAfter epoch-A, the source model from a previous epoch was used in place of a point source model for the initial\nphase coherence calibration.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\ndata were then edited in a station based manner. At this point, a copy of the data was written\nout to disk; this data will be referred to as the edited, un-self-calibrated data. Within DIFMAP,\nstandard imaging and self-calibration techniques were applied to obtain the best possible total\nintensity model. This model was then written out to AIPS and used to self-calibrate the edited,\nun-self-calibrated data (using first a 20 second solution interval for phase calibration followed by a\n10 minute solution interval for amplitude calibration).\nFollowing additional phase self-calibration passes in AIPS, the effects of feed leakage (D-terms)\nwere removed from the parallel and cross hand data. This is crucial since the D-terms induce\nnon-closing errors in the RR and LL data that are not removed by self-calibration and could\nmimic a circularly polarized signal. On a single baseline scan these errors are of order D 2 for an\nunpolarized source and mL D for a polarized source, where mL is the fractional linear polarization.\n(See \u00a7A.1 for a detailed analysis.)\nThe antenna D-terms were determined from observations of the strong, compact source PKS\n0528+134, using the program LPCAL6 in AIPS (Lepp\u00e4nen, Zensus, & Diamond 1995). The\namplitudes of the D-terms ranged from approximately 1% to 5% with values close to 2% being\nmost typical. As described in \u00a7A.1, our D-term calibration is accurate enough to limit D-term\nrelated errors in our circular polarization images to less than 0.2% of the corresponding linear\npolarization.\nAfter D-term removal, a further amplitude self-calibration was applied using the initial\ntotal intensity model from DIFMAP. This is important to remove any amplitude gain errors\nmade by the amplitude self-calibration prior to removal of the D-terms. A final round of phase\nself-calibration was performed before imaging in all four Stokes parameters. These images were\nmade in the usual way and are presented in Section 4.\n\n3.\n\nCircular Polarization Calibration\n\nThe calibration steps described above are similar to those used for any VLBA observation\ndesigned to measure linear polarization (Cotton 1993; Roberts, Wardle, & Brown 1994). For\ncircular polarization, we must also carefully consider the relative calibration of the right (R)\nand left (L) complex antenna gains. Appendix A.2 explores this issue in depth; here we briefly\nsummarize our three separate techniques for calibrating the R and L complex antenna gains.\n\n6\n\nThe D-terms found by LPCAL are in the linear feed model. Versions of AIPS prior to the April 15, 1997 release\nrequire D-terms to be in the ellipticity-orientation model if they are to be applied to all four complex correlations. For\nthis reason, it was necessary to translate the D-terms to the ellipticity-orientation model prior to their application.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n3.1.\n\nGain Transfer\n\nIn this technique, we initially make no assumption about the presence or absence of circular\npolarization in our sources. All self-calibration rounds are performed with the rigorous assumption\n(RR + LL)/2 = I \u0303model . This assumption will calibrate only the average of R and L at a given\nantenna, leaving the relative R/L antenna gain ratio completely uncorrected.\nAt the end of the calibration only the R/L gain ratios remain to be calibrated before we\ncan make circular polarization images. If we know that some of our sources have no circular\npolarization, we can calibrate this ratio on these sources by doing a final self-calibration with the\nassumption: RR = I \u0303model and LL = I \u0303model .\nWe found these corrections (one per scan in amplitude and phase) on the subset of sources\nwhich appeared to have no circular polarization (see \u00a7A.2.2 for discussion of how these sources\nwere determined.). The corrections were then averaged and smoothed on a 4 hour time scale\nbefore application to all sources in the sample. The errors in this technique are dominated by\nthe short-term (scan-to-scan) R/L gain fluctuations. Analyzed in \u00a7A.2.2, these fluctuations can\nlimit the sensitivity of this technique to . 0.15% of the local total intensity. The errors listed in\nthe tables of results were derived using equation A20 and we believe they provide a conservative\nestimate of the 1\u03c3 uncertainty.\nCircular polarization images produced from data calibrated with this technique are referred to\nin the text as gain transfer images. Making images in this way depends critically on the stability\nof the antenna gains. It is a tribute to the outstanding performance of the VLBA that such images\nare now possible.\n\n3.2.\n\nZero-V Self-calibration\n\nAnother technique is to perform all self-calibration rounds with the assumption that there is\nno real circular polarization (Stokes V ) in the data. In this calibration scheme, separate complex\ngain corrections are found for the R and L hands at each antenna by assuming RR = I \u0303model\nand LL = I \u0303model . This assumption will try to reduce any circular polarization (real or spurious)\nas much as possible by adjusting the complex antenna gains. We will refer to this calibration\ntechnique as zero-V self-calibration.\nReal circular polarization is additive in the RR and LL correlations while the complex gains\nare multiplicative. Therefore, if a source has significant extended structure, zero-V self-cal will\nnot be able to completely remove real circular polarization from the source. In general, if the\nstrong core of a source has real circular polarization, this procedure will remove the circular\npolarization from the strong core and transfer it (with reverse sign but the same local fractional\nlevel) to the weaker extended structure. If the circular polarization is originally on the weaker\nextended structure (rather than the core), zero-V self-cal cannot modify it much without inducing\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nsignificant circular polarization on the core.\n\n3.3.\n\nPhase-Only Mapping\n\nThe previous two calibration techniques, gain transfer and zero-V self-cal, are subject to\nerrors in the antenna amplitude gains. The idea behind phase-only mapping is to demonstrate\nthat any circular polarization detected by these techniques is also present (in a consistent manner)\nin the phases of the data alone. If a source has real circular polarization, then the RR and LL\nclosure phases will be slightly different, and this difference is preserved throughout the calibration\nprocess. For simple sources, we can even use the phase-only image to predict the amplitudes of\ncircular polarization measured by the other techniques.\nTo construct a phase-only image, we set the amplitudes of the RR and LL correlations to\nunity and construct the V visibilities from the resulting \"phase-only\" correlations. Naturally, if\nthe source is a simple point source or has no real circular polarization, this technique will not\ndetect any circular polarization. For simple sources with extended structure and real circular\npolarization, phase-only mapping produces circular polarization images that are anti-symmetric\n(to first order) at the jet position around the location of the core.\nTo construct phase-only images that are not dominated by short-term phase noise fluctuations\n(\u223c 0.2\u25e6 ) between the R and L hands at each antenna, we found that the phases must be\nself-calibrated with the assumption RR = I \u0303model and LL = I \u0303model . However, as should be\nexpected, the phase-only images did not at all depend on how the amplitudes were corrected:\ncalibrating the amplitudes by assuming either (RR + LL)/2 = I \u0303model or RR = I \u0303model , LL = I \u0303model\nproduces identical results.\n\n4.\n\nThe Observations\n\nOf the 13 observed sources, we have reliable detections of circular polarization on four: 3C 84\n(J0319+41), PKS 0528+134 (J0530+13), 3C 273 (J1229+02), and 3C 279 (J1256-05). The 15 GHz\nobservations of these four sources are presented individually. The 15 GHz observations of the\nremaining 9 sources are presented as a group.\n\n4.1.\n\n3C 279 (J1256-05)\n\nImages for the 1996.05 epoch of 3C 279 in total intensity, linear polarization, and circular\npolarization are presented in Figure 1. The circular polarization image was produced with the\ngain transfer calibration technique (\u00a73.1). The images are very similar to those from the later\nepochs (see Wardle et al. (1998) for images from the 1996.57 epoch), although the core increases\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nin strength (as does the circular polarization) in the later epochs. The images display a strong,\ncompact core with a jet extending to the southwest at position angle -113 degrees. There is a\nbright knot in the jet at approximately 3 milli-arcseconds from the core.\nThe core has modest fractional linear polarization (mL = 4.1%). The observed integrated\ncircular polarization on the core is 36 mJy, corresponding to +0.3% local fractional circular\npolarization. While this measurement superficially constitutes a 30\u03c3 detection when compared\nto the RMS noise on the map, analysis of the gain transfer technique in \u00a7A.2.2 shows that such\nmeasurements are limited by short time-scale gain fluctuations. The associated errors in the gain\ntransfer circular polarization maps may be as large as 0.15% of the corresponding total intensity.\nValues obtained by the other calibration techniques (described below), however, increase our\nconfidence that our circular polarization measurement for epoch 1996.05 is accurate to a few\nmilliJanskys.\nDetailed, u-v plane model-fitting of the core region in total intensity and linear polarization\n(at both 15 and 22 GHz), reveals that the core consists of two closely spaced (\u223c 0.1 mas)\ncomponents. In Wardle et al. (1998) we argue that circular polarization is associated with the\nwestern core component (CW) in the 1996.57 epoch. Assuming this association holds for the other\nepochs, CW is +1.2% circularly polarized in epoch 1996.05. The core fluxes and polarizations for\nall five epochs are given in Table 3.\n3C 279 provides our most robust circular polarization observations. As a result of its\nrelatively simple, (unequal) point double morphology on milli-arcsecond scales, all three of our\ncalibration techniques give readily interpretable and consistent results. Figure 2 displays the\ncircular polarization images as produced by our three calibration techniques in epoch 1996.05.\nFigure 2a displays the image produced by our gain transfer calibration procedure. The\nimage is the same as in Figure 1 except that it has a different boundary for easy comparison to\nFigures 2b and 2c, produced by our other calibration procedures. In epoch 1996.05, the integrated\ncore circular polarization measured by the transfer of gains calibration is +36 (\u00b118) mJy.\nFigure 2b displays the image produced by the zero-V self-cal, calibration procedure. The\ncircular polarization signal detected by this technique is located on the bright knot in the jet at\nthe \u22120.3% level. As explained in \u00a7A.2.1, self-calibration assuming zero circular polarization will\ntransfer circular polarization from the strong core of an unequal point double (like 3C 279) to the\nweaker jet component at the same local fractional level but with reversed sign. Assuming the\ncircular polarization truly lies on the core (as revealed by the gain transfer calibration technique),\nwe can extrapolate the core circular polarization from the observed jet circular polarization by\nmodeling the source as a simple point double and using the relation, V1 \u2243 \u2212V2 (I1 /I2 ) (see \u00a7A.2.1).\nApplying this simple relation to epoch 1996.05, gives an integrated core circular polarization of\n+32 (+9,\u22123) mJy.\nFigure 2c displays the image produced by our phase-only method. The circular polarization\ndetected by this technique is anti-symmetric about the core with the jet knot location. The\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nintegrated intensities of \u2212228 \u03bcJy for the jet and +198 \u03bcJy for the anti-jet from the phase-only\ndata can be used to predict the core circular polarization, using equation A22 (\u00a7A.2.3) and\nassuming a simple point double model for 3C 279. Applying this relation to epoch 1996.05, gives\nan integrated core circular polarization of +27 (+7,\u22122) mJy.\nIt is important to note that the errors associated with the zero-V self-cal and phase-only\nmeasurements of circular polarization reflect not only random noise but also the possible systematic\nloss of signal, described in \u00a7A.2.1, associated with assuming no circular polarization at one or\nmore steps in the self-calibration process.\nThe gain transfer, zero-V self-cal, and phase-only maps from the later epochs are very similar\nto those displayed in Figure 2 for epoch 1996.05. Table 4 displays the raw measurements of\ncircular polarization from the zero-V self-cal and phase-only calibration techniques. Table 5\nsummarizes the results from applying a simple point double model to these raw measurements and\nextrapolating the circular polarization of the core. The extrapolations are compared to the more\ndirect gain transfer results. Figure 3 compares the results from the three calibration techniques.\n\n4.2.\n\n3C 84 (J0319+41)\n\nFigure 4 displays images for the 1996.74 epoch of 3C 84 in both total intensity and circular\npolarization structure. 3C 84 has a strong core which is elongated in the north-south direction.\nThe jet extends to the south forming a diffuse lobe-like region about 10 mas south of the core.\nTo the north we clearly detect the counter feature reported by Vermeulen, Readhead, and Backer\n(1994) and Walker, Romney, and Benson (1994). The total intensity structure of 3C 84 does\nnot appear to change significantly over the course of our observations. The linear polarization\nstructure (not shown) of 3C 84 is very weak. Only the \"lobe\" shows significant linear polarization\nin a couple isolated spots at the 1% local level.\nFigure 4b is produced by zero-V self-calibration and clearly shows the circular polarization\nstructure to lie in the south-eastern part of the elongated core at approximately the +1% (\u00b10.1%)\nlevel. A smaller, negative piece of circular polarization is located just north and west of the\npositive circular polarization. In \u00a7A.2.1, we show that zero-V self-cal does very little to modify the\ncircular polarization in a source if it is well separated from the main peak in total intensity. Here\nthe V peak is only one beam-width south of the I peak, and we believe the negative component is\nan artifact resulting from the zero-V self-calibration assumption. We were indeed able to produce\njust such a negative signal by zero-V self-cal in simulated data sets of 3C 84. The images produced\nby zero-V self-cal in the other epochs are essentially the same as figure 4b, each revealing about\n+1% (\u00b10.1%) local circular polarization in the same location.\nThe gain transfer and phase-only images are presented in Figure 5. They are both very\nconsistent with the zero-V self-cal result. The gain transfer image (Figure 5a) shows the positive\ncircular polarization to be stronger (28 versus 18 mJy/beam) than the zero-V self-cal image. The\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nsmaller, negative circular polarization is also shown by the gain transfer image, although it is\nmuch weaker and located more to the west rather than to the north-west as indicated by the\nzero-V self-cal image.\nThe other epochs show generally consistent gain transfer results, although the quality of the\ngain transfer results vary from epoch to epoch. The circular polarization signals measured by\ngain transfer are always in the same location (south and east of the map peak) and are usually\nwithin a couple of mJy of the zero-V self-cal result. The worst gain transfer result is the 1996.57\nepoch which has large pits and valleys in the circular polarization image, masking the circular\npolarization signal clearly detected by the other two techniques.\nFigure 5b is the phase-only circular polarization image of 3C 84 in the 1995.74 epoch. The\nresult is difficult to interpret directly due to the extreme complexity of the source. However it is\nclear that this image is consistent with the results produced by the other two techniques. The\nphase-only results from the other epochs are equally consistent.\n\n4.3.\n\nPKS 0528+134 (J0530+13)\n\nThe total intensity, linear polarization, and circular polarization images of PKS 0528+134\nfrom our 1996.57 epoch are presented in Figure 6. The total intensity and circular polarization\nobservations from the other epochs are very similar to those presented. The linear polarization,\nhowever, changes considerably over the course of our observations. PKS 0528+134 is a barely\nresolved point source with an extension to the NNE. In tapered images we observe extended flux\napproximately 3 milli-arcseconds to the NNE, suggesting that the parsec-scale jet extends in that\ndirection. The circular polarization (as revealed by the gain transfer calibration technique) lies\ndirectly on the core with an integrated intensity of +45 mJy \u00b110 mJy (mc = +0.6%). The circular\npolarization maps for the other epochs are very similar, each revealing strong positive circular\npolarization: +40 to +50 mJy in three of the other epochs and +100 mJy in one epoch.\nOur model-fitting of the total intensity data reveals the core to consist of two closely spaced\ncomponents, however the linear polarization structure is fit quite poorly by this model. We cannot\nassociate the circular polarization with either of these total intensity model components with any\nconfidence. As a result, we will treat the core as a single component with the associated linear\nand circular polarization. Table 6 contains the integrated measurements of total intensity, linear\npolarization, and circular polarization for the core of PKS 0528+134 for each of the five epochs\npresented in this paper.\nZero-V self-cal and phase-only imaging both revealed no detectable circular polarization\non PKS 0528+134. As explained in \u00a7A.2, neither of these techniques would detect circular\npolarization on what is essentially a point source. However, we are confident that the circular\npolarization revealed in the gain transfer images is real.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n4.4.\n\n3C 273 (J1229+02)\n\nFigure 7 displays the total intensity, linear polarization, and circular polarization images of\n3C 273 for the 1996.41 epoch. In these images 3C 273 has a strong core with a bright jet extending\nat a position angle of \u223c \u2212120\u25e6 . The core has weak linear polarization at the 0.3% level, and the\njet is more strongly polarized at the \u2243 10 \u2212 40% level. The observed circular polarization lies\ndirectly on the core with an integrated intensity of \u221274 mJy \u00b115 mJy (mc = \u22120.6%).\nThe total intensity and linear polarization structure of the jet are very similar in the other\nepochs. The integrated flux density of the core, however, increases in strength from epoch 1996.05,\nwhere it is 2.8 Jy, to epoch 1996.57, where it is 13.4 Jy. By epoch 1996.74, the core is clearly\ncomprised of two components (denoted CE and CW in Table 7). We report the results of u-v\nplane model-fitting of the core region for each epoch in Table 7.\nThe circular polarization structure of the core also changes over the course of the epochs in a\nmanner consistent with the total intensity and linear polarization changes. In epoch 1996.05, the\nintegrated circular polarization is \u221210 mJy \u00b110 mJy (mc \u223c \u22120.4% but consistent with zero) in a\nvery noisy gain transfer image. At epoch 1996.23, the total intensity of the core is much higher,\nbut we detect no circular polarization with a limit < 0.2%. In 1996.41 (Figure 7), the circular\npolarization is \u22120.6% and the core also shows the first signs of linear polarization. In 1996.57, the\ncircular polarization is \u22120.5% and the linear polarization has increased further. By 1996.74 the\ncore has split in total intensity and linear polarization; the circular polarization also splits and is\npredominately associated with the western core (CW) component. Figure 8 displays uniformly\nweighted total intensity, linear polarization, and circular polarization images from the 1996.74\nepoch.\nFigure 9 displays the circular polarization images produced by the gain transfer, zero-V\nself-cal, and phase-only calibration procedures for epoch 1996.41. Figure 9a is the gain transfer\nimage presented in Figure 7c, framed differently for ease of comparison to the other images.\nFigure 9b is the zero-V self-cal image. It is clear that the circular polarization from the core has\nbeen transfered (by self-calibration) to the jet with reversed sign and much reduced (absolute)\nlevel. Figure 9c is the phase-only image. As expected, the signal in the phase-only map is\nanti-symmetric about the core with respect to the jet location.\nDue to the complexity of 3C 273, it is difficult to use the zero-V self-cal and phase-only\ncalibration techniques to derive firm numbers for the true circular polarization of 3C 273. The\nbest numbers are derived from the gain transfer calibration procedure, but it is clear that the\nzero-V self-cal and phase-only images are consistent with the gain transfer results. The 1996.57\nand 1996.74 epochs also produce zero-V self-cal and phase-only images consistent with the results\nfrom gain transfer calibration.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n4.5.\n\nOther Sources\n\nCircular polarization observations (using gain transfer calibration) from our remaining nine\nsources are summarized in Table 8. In most cases, these sources show no circular polarization from\nany of our calibration techniques. The upper limits and errors reported in Table 8 are estimated\n\u221a\nto be roughly 2 times the noise peaks on the circular polarization images. It is interesting to\nnote that, in general, the upper limits estimated from noise peaks are consistent with the estimate\nof expected error of . 0.15% due to short term gain fluctuations (derived in \u00a7A.2.2).\nIn isolated epochs, a few of the sources (J0738+17, J1512-09, J1751+09, J1927+73, and\nJ2005+77) appear to exhibit some core circular polarization. In all of these sources, except\nJ1927+73, the detected core circular polarization is comparable to the peak noise in the image. In\nthe three epochs in which it is detected, the circular polarization signal for core of J1927+73 is\nsignificantly larger than the peak noise.\n\n5.\n\nReliability of Calibration and Detection\n\nIn appendix A, we analyze in detail the calibration for circular polarization. Here we provide\na more general discussion of the reliability of our calibration and claims of detection of circular\npolarization.\nChief among the sources of spurious circular polarization are antenna feed leakage (D-terms)\nand improper gain calibration. Our analysis in \u00a7A.1 demonstrates that the D-terms, even if\ncompletely uncorrected, cannot be the source of the circular polarization we observe. Our\ncorrection of the D-terms is accurate enough to limit feed leakage errors in of circular polarization\nimages to 0.2% of the linear polarization (which itself is typically only a few percent of the\ncorresponding total intensity). The antenna D-terms are not a factor in the reliability or quality\nof our results.\nIn \u00a7A.2, we describe the three gain calibration techniques we have used to detect and measure\ncircular polarization. Two of these techniques, gain transfer and zero-V self-cal, derive independent\nmeasures of the R versus L antenna gains. The third technique, phase-only imaging, is independent\nof the antenna amplitude gains and is used to demonstrate that a circular polarization signal is\nalso present in the phases of the data.\nThe zero-V self-cal technique can reduce or relocate existing circular polarization. This\ntechnique assumes that there is no true circular polarization on the source in question, i.e. that\nRR = I \u0303mod and LL = I \u0303mod . As a result, true circular polarization can be modeled in part or in\nwhole as a gain error and removed from the data. On a point source any true circular polarization\nwill be completely removed by this technique; however, the same is not true for more complicated\nsources. Because true circular polarization is additive in the RR and LL correlations, it cannot be\ncompletely \"corrected\" by multiplicative antenna gains.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nFor a typical source with a strong core and a much weaker jet, circular polarization from\nthe core of the source will be transfered by the derived antennas gains (which try to minimize\nthe overall circular polarization) to the weaker parts of the source, with reversed sign, and at\n(roughly) the same local fractional level. With the notable exception of 3C 279, most sources are\ntoo complicated to directly disentangle this effect and derive the true circular polarization of the\nsource. (Extended trial and error simulations could, in principle, reconstruct the original circular\npolarization distribution.) Also, if the true circular polarization is located in the weaker jet (as in\n3C 84), then zero-V self-cal does much less to modify it.\nThe gain transfer technique provides our most direct measurement of circular polarization.\nThe R/L gain ratios applied to 3C 84, J0530+13, 3C 273, and 3C 279 were derived from the\nremaining nine sources. As a result, no assumption was made about the presence of circular\npolarization on these four sources. However, in this procedure, the antenna gains applied to the\nother nine sources are not really source independent. To what extent can we trust the results of\nthe gain transfer on these sources?\nThe sources in our observation were highly interleaved to maximize u-v coverage. This fact,\ncoupled with our four hour averaging interval for the derived gain table, helps to make the gain\ntable largely independent of individual sources. As described in \u00a7A.2.2, we tested this assumption\nand found very nearly the same results when the sources which have circular polarization are\nallowed to contribute their gain corrections. We conclude that the results on these other sources,\nwhich were allowed to contribute to the gain table, can be trusted within the quoted errors.\nOne danger in the gain transfer technique is that the R/L antenna gains may not be stable\non time scales long enough to allow their transfer. Our results demonstrate that the gains are\nindeed stable enough to produce reliable results. The observed circular polarizations are consistent\nin terms of sign, location, and amplitude from epoch to epoch. (See Figure 10.) We would not\nexpect this consistency if the R/L antenna gains were not stable on time scales of at least several\nhours. It is important to note that the consistency is not perfect. This is partly due to source\nvariability, but may also reveal limits to the reliability of this technique. In fact, our main source\nof error in this technique is short time scale gain fluctuations which go uncorrected. Section A.2.2\nprovides an estimate of the errors from these fluctuations.\nAn important point is that the strong negative circular polarization observed on 3C 273\nincreases our confidence in the gain transfer calibration technique. 3C 273 and 3C 279 are neighbors\nin the sky and interleaved in our observation schedule. Due to the four hour averaging time, they\nwill receive essentially the same set of R/L antenna gains. Any bias in the antenna gains would\nbe expected to have the same effect on both sources; however, they have circular polarizations of\nopposite sign.\nThe consistency between all of our techniques is best evaluated with 3C 279 where we can\nuse a simple point double model to directly compare the results of all three approaches. As\ndemonstrated by our results in table 5 (graphically displayed in figure 3), these techniques always\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nagree that a signal was detected and on the sign of that signal. Furthermore, the techniques agree\nin amplitude to within a factor of two (and often much better than that).\n\n6.\n\nPhysical Interpretation\n\nCircular polarization may be produced as an intrinsic component of synchrotron radiation or\nby Faraday conversion of linear to circular polarization (e.g. Jones & O'Dell 1977). Determining\nwhich mechanism produces the circular polarization we observe is crucial to using the observations\nas a physical probe of parsec-scale radio jets. Intrinsic circular polarization demands a significant\nuni-directional component of magnetic field while Faraday conversion requires a significant\npopulation of low energy relativistic particles in the jet (Wardle et al. 1998).\nIn Wardle et al. (1998) we analyze the 1996.57 epoch of 3C 279 in detail and use limits on\nthe circular polarization present in the 22 GHz companion observations to show that Faraday\nconversion is the origin of the circular polarization observed in that source. Our results set an\nupper limit on the low energy cutoff to the relativistic particle distribution of \u03b3min \u2264 20 with likely\nvalues for \u03b3min on the order of a few. Using the results of Celotti and Fabian (1993), who showed\nthat jets comprised mainly of an electron-proton plasma must have \u03b3min \u2265 100 to avoid carrying\ntoo much kinetic energy, we suggested that 3C 279 has a primarily electron-positron plasma.\nWe cannot make similar arguments for the other sources until we have their circular\npolarization results at 22 GHz. However, we can make several observations about the presence of\ncircular polarization in the sources we observe.\nIn each of the sources where we have detected circular polarization, we find it either in or\nvery near the core. This is perhaps not too surprising given that the signals we detect are a very\nsmall fraction of the total intensity and the core is the brightest part of the jet in these sources.\nHowever, in 3C 84 we detect circular polarization not on the brightest part of the core, but rather\nat the base of the southern jet, which is locally a factor of 2-3 less bright than the map peak. In\n3C 273 we do not detect significant circular polarization until epoch 1996.41, although the core\nis already very strong by epoch 1996.23. By epoch 1996.74, the circular polarization of 3C 273\nis predominately associated with the emerging core component, rather than split evenly between\nboth core components. These results can be understood from the work of Jones and O'Dell (1977),\nwho find that circular polarization, however it is produced, is a strong function of opacity and is\nstrongest near the \u03c4 = 1 surface.\nThe circular polarization we observe is linked to other properties of the sources. The core\nof 3C 273 undergoes an outburst over the course of our observations in 1996. The May epoch\nobservations of 3C 273 are the first in which we see significant circular polarization in this source.\nMay is also the first epoch in which we observe linear polarization in the core of 3C 273. The\nsimultaneous appearance of linear and circular polarization in the core of 3C 273 most likely results\nfrom the changing opacity in the core region. Figure 11 shows the spectral index of the core of\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n3C 273 between 15 and 22 GHz as a function of epoch (Ojha 1998). This figure demonstrates that\nthe core begins to become significantly less opaque by the 1996.41 epoch when we first detect\nstrong circular polarization.\nThe core of 3C 279 also undergoes an outburst in 1996. We observe the western core\ncomponent, CW, to nearly triple in strength from January to September. The circularly polarized\nflux we observe in 3C 279 appears to track the rise in total flux of this component, although the\nuncertainty of the measurements in the 1996.23 and 1996.41 epochs makes detailed analysis of the\nevolution difficult.\nA second result is that the sign of the circular polarization is constant across epoch in all of\nour sources. 3C 84, PKS 0528+134, and 3C 279 all have positive circular polarization while 3C 273\nhas negative circular polarization. 3C 84 changes very little in total intensity or linear polarization\nover our observations, but the other three sources undergo significant changes in flux and/or linear\npolarization. For the sign of the circular polarization to remain constant, there must be a stable,\nuni-directional component of magnetic field in the jet.\nIn fact, both Faraday conversion and intrinsic circular polarization require the presence of\nsome excess uni-directional component of magnetic field. In the case of conversion, this field\nprovides the small amount of Faraday rotation necessary for conversion. (Conversion cannot\noperate on pure Stokes Q.) A tangled field geometry or differential abberation (Jones, personal\ncommunication) can remove the need for Faraday rotation, but such a geometry is unlikely to\nproduce the sign consistency we observe. It is also possible to produce some net uni-directional\nfield stochastically, but again, it would not be expected to remain constant (in sign) while a source\nis undergoing large internal changes.\nSingle dish circular polarization observations at 8 GHz by Hodge and Aller (1977) detected\nabout +0.1% integrated circular polarization on 3C 279, consistent in sign with our observations.\nThey detected about \u22120.1% integrated circular polarization on 3C 273, also consistent with our\nobservations. For 3C 84, they measured about \u22120.1% circular polarization which is opposite in\nsign to our observations. Future multi-frequency VLBI observations of 3C 84 will be important to\ndetermine if this sign difference is an opacity effect or reflects slow changes in the source. Their\nobservations of 3C 279 and 3C 273 suggest that the uni-directional component of magnetic field in\nthese sources may be stable on a time scale of decades in our frame of observation. It is possible\nthat this is directly related to the magnetic field at the central engine (e.g. Begelman, Blandford,\n& Rees 1984).\nIt is also interesting to examine the relation of circular polarization to linear polarization.\nIn the cores of 3C 84 and 3C 273 we observe equal or less linear polarization than circular\npolarization. The linear polarization observed, if taken as a direct measure of field order, is not\nenough to produce the observed circular polarization by Faraday conversion. Lack of observed\nlinear polarization also presents a problem if the circular polarization is produced by the intrinsic\nmechanism which requires a significant uniform field. The most likely explanation is that external\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nFaraday depolarization in the nuclear region of the AGN has significantly reduced the degree of\nlinear polarization without affecting the circular polarization. This seems to be the case for 3C 84\n(Wardle 1971), and we note that Taylor (1998) reports a large rotation measure of -1900 rad/m2\nfor the core of 3C 273.\n\n7.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have observed parsec-scale circular polarization in the radio jets of 3C 84, PKS 0528+134,\n3C 273, and 3C 279 with the VLBA at 15 GHz. For each source our detections are at the level of\n\u223c 0.3 \u2212 1% local fractional circular polarization. Each individual detection has a significance in the\nrange of 3 to 10 \u03c3. The circular polarizations we observe are consistent across epoch with changes\nin structure clearly linked to physical changes within the sources. To confirm our detections, we\nhave devised three calibration techniques to help mitigate our sensitivity to gain errors. We find\nthat all three techniques give consistent and reproducible results.\nOur observations of circular polarization are closely tied to the physical conditions within\nthe radio jets. We always detect circular polarization near the region of unit optical depth.\nIn two sources, 3C 273 and 3C 279, we observe core outbursts during 1996 and find that the\ncircular polarization is closely tied to these events. In 3C 273 we first observe significant circular\npolarization in the core as the outburst is reaching its maximum, simultaneous with our first\nobservations of linear polarization from the same region. When a new component emerges from\nthe core of 3C 273, the circular polarization is predominately associated with it.\nCircular polarization may be produced as an intrinsic component of synchrotron radiation or\nby the Faraday conversion of linear to circular polarization. Our observations, at a single frequency,\ndo not distinguish between these possible mechanisms, but independent of the mechanism, the\nremarkable consistency across epoch of the sign of the observed circular polarization suggests\nthe existence of a long term, stable, uni-directional component of the magnetic field. Single dish\nobservations of 3C 273 and 3C 279 at 8 GHz by Hodge and Aller (1977) suggest that this stability\nin these sources may span decades in our frame of observation.\nDirect imaging of circular polarization with the VLBA provides an entirely new probe\nof the magnetic field structure and particle spectrum of the parsec-scale radio jets of AGN.\nMulti-frequency observations of circular polarization will be able to distinguish between the\nintrinsic and Faraday conversion mechanisms for producing circular polarization. By imaging all\nfour Stokes parameters at multiple frequencies, we can construct detailed models of the entire\nradiative emission and transfer through the source and begin to determine the composition and\nenergy spectrum of the relativistic plasma within the jet.\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\n8.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank R.

It is critical to\nunderstand and remove effects which may corrupt a circularly polarized signal or may produce\nspurious circular polarization. These effects include instrumental polarization, gain errors, beam\nsquint, and baseline based effects.\n\nA.1.\n\nInstrumental Polarization\n\nIn the leakage feed model (e.g. Roberts et al. 1994) the output antenna voltages for nominally\nright and left circularly polarized feeds are given by\nVR = GR (ER e\u2212i\u03c6 + DR EL e+i\u03c6 )\n\n(A3)\n\nVL = GL (EL e+i\u03c6 + DL ER e\u2212i\u03c6 )\n\n(A4)\n\nand\n\nwhere GR and GL are complex gains, DR and DL are the complex, fractional response of each\nfeed to the orthogonal polarization, and \u03c6 is the parallactic angle.\nThe time-averaged, parallel-hand complex correlations of these voltages detected at two\nantennas can be expressed (Roberts et al. 1994) in terms of the stokes parameters as:\n\u2217  \u0303\nRi Rj\u2217 = GiR G\u2217jR [(I \u0303ij + \u1e7cij )ei(\u2212\u03c6i +\u03c6j ) + DiR DjR\n(Iij \u2212 \u1e7cij )ei(\u03c6i \u2212\u03c6j )\n\u2217\n+DiR P\u0303ji\u2217 ei(\u03c6i +\u03c6j ) + DjR\nP\u0303ij e\u2212i(\u03c6i +\u03c6j ) ]\n\n(A5)\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nand\n\u2217  \u0303\nLi L\u2217j = GiL G\u2217jL [(I \u0303ij \u2212 \u1e7cij )ei(\u03c6i \u2212\u03c6j ) + DiL DjL\n(Iij + \u1e7cij )ei(\u2212\u03c6i +\u03c6j )\n\n(A6)\n\n\u2217\n+DiL P\u0303ij e\u2212i(\u03c6i +\u03c6j ) + DjL\nP\u0303ji\u2217 ei(\u03c6i +\u03c6j ) ]\n\nwhere P\u0303 is the linear polarization.\nTo detect circular polarization it is necessary to correct the parallel-hand correlations for the\nD-term leakage. This is particularly important for sources with high degrees of linear polarization.\nSuppose the measured D-terms are related to the true D-terms in the following way.\nD true = D measured + \u2206\n\n(A7)\n\nThe leakage of D-term errors into the circular polarization image can be approximated by\nq\nI\n(2\u2206D meas + 2(Na \u2212 1)mL \u2206 + \u22062 )\nVleak \u223c p\nNs Na (Na \u2212 1)\n\n(A8)\n\nwhere \u2206 and D meas are rms values, mL is the fractional linear polarization, Na is the number of\nantennas, and Ns is the number of scans which are separated in parallactic angle. A factor for the\nnumber of IFs is omitted because the D-terms are strongly correlated between IFs. In the worse\ncase scenario of no D-term correction\nq\nI\nVleak \u223c p\n( 2(Na \u2212 1)mL D + D 2 ).\nNs Na (Na \u2212 1)\n\n(A9)\n\nFigure 12 is a plot of VI versus fractional polarization, mL , for a point source with no intrinsic\ncircular polarization. The D-terms have an RMS of 2.5% and were added to an originally D-term\nfree point model created by the AIPS task UVMOD. The model was built on a 5 scan, 10 antenna\nobservation. The D-terms were added by 'applying' the D-term solutions found for a recent 15\nGHz VLBA observation. The ratio, VI , was measured at the location of the I peak in the cleaned\nimages. The slope and intercept of this plot agree well with the expected relationship.\nFor the observations presented in section 4, the measured D-terms are typically 1-5% with\n\u223c 2% being most common. We estimate their errors to be about 15% of the measured D-terms,\nso \u2206 \u223c 0.2 to 0.8%. These errors were estimated by comparing the D-term solutions from\nPKS 0528+134 (which were applied to all sources) to D-term solutions found independently on\nother sources in the same experiment. With the D-terms corrected to this level of accuracy,\nVleak /I < 0.002mL + 3 \u00d7 10\u22125 in our observations.\nA.2.\n\nGain Calibration\n\nCorrect gain calibration of the R and L complex gains at each antenna is critical to the\ndetection and measurement of circular polarization. In particular, it is the calibration of the gain\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\ndifference between the R and L feeds, best represented by the complex gain ratio, R/L, which\npresents the largest problem for circular polarization observations using circular antenna feeds.\nSelf-calibration attempts to correct the complex antenna gains by comparing the u-v data to\nthe transform of an idealized model of the source. These solutions are found in a least-square,\nantenna-based manner with all of the baselines to a particular antenna used to constrain the\nsolution. Ideally, the solutions for all antennas are found simultaneously.\nFor simplicity, assume that we have the correct total intensity model for a source, Imod . The\ncorresponding data may then be self-calibrated using Imod in one of two ways:\n\u2022 Assuming RR = I \u0303mod and LL = I \u0303mod . This method derives a separate correction for the\nRight and Left hand systems at each antenna.\n) = I \u0303mod and thus deriving a single correction to be applied to both the\n\u2022 Assuming ( RR+LL\n2\nRight and Left hand systems at each antenna.\n\nA.2.1.\n\nSelf-Calibration Assuming Zero Circular Polarization.\n\nThe first method derives a separate correction for the right and left hand systems at each\nantenna but assumes no circular polarization in the source. In principle this method can correct\nthe R/L complex antenna gain ratios in the absence of real circular polarization. In the presence\nof real circular polarization the complex correlations are\nRi Rj\u2217 = GiR G\u2217jR (I \u0303ij + \u1e7cij )\n\n(A10)\n\nLi L\u2217j = GiL G\u2217jL (I \u0303ij \u2212 \u1e7cij ).\n\n(A11)\n\nand\n\nThe measured gains that the second technique finds and removes from the data will be related\nto the true complex gains by\nmeas\nGtrue\n(A12)\niR = GiR giR\nwhere the g's are residual gains that satisfy the conditions\n\u2217  \u0303\ngiR gjR\n(Iij + \u1e7cij ) \u2248 I \u0303ij\n\n(A13)\n\n\u2217  \u0303\ngiL gjL\n(Iij \u2212 \u1e7cij ) \u2248 I \u0303ij\n\n(A14)\n\nand\nas well as possible across the array. Real circular polarization is additive in the RR and LL\ncorrelations, so the multiplicative gains applied by self-calibration cannot completely remove real\ncircular polarization except when the source is a simple point in total intensity. In fact, this kind\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nof gain calibration may reduce and relocate real circular polarization to weaker components but\ncannot create it.\nSelf-calibration with the assumption of zero circular polarization can seriously modify any\ncircularly polarized signal present in a data set. Circular polarization originating on weak\ncomponents seems to be largely unmodified, while circular polarization originating on strong\ncomponents is shifted (with reverse sign but the same fractional level) to the weaker components\nin the I image. Figure 13 shows a point double source with real circular polarization, before and\nafter self-calibration.\nFor point sources, such as PKS 0528+134, real circular polarization will look simply like\na difference in amplitude gain between RR and LL and will be completely removed by this\nprocedure.\nFor an unequal point double, such as 3C 279, there is an inherent ambiguity about the true\nlocation of any circular polarization detected with zero-V self-cal. Circular polarization may have\noriginated on either the weak or the strong component but will show up only at the location of the\nweak component in the zero-V self-cal image. Assuming the circular polarization originated on the\nstronger core component, it is possible to extrapolate the true circular polarization distribution.\nFor a strongly unequal point double:\nV1 \u2243 \u2212V2 (I1 /I2 )\n\n(A15)\n\nwhere V2 is the circular polarization on the weak component after self-calibration assuming zero\ncircular polarization and V1 is the extrapolated circular polarization of the core.\nThe fractional error in this extrapolated measurement of V1 is then the same as the fractional\nerror in V2 which is best determined by examination of the off-peak noise in the image. In addition\nto this noise, our creation of model sources similar to 3C 279 showed there is a systematic loss of\nsignal caused by the assumption of zero circular polarization on the order of 10-20%. As a result,\nequation A15 will extrapolate values for the core of 3C 279 that are typically 10-20% low.\nFor complicated sources, such as 3C 84 and 3C 273, it is much more difficult to predict the\neffects of assuming no circular polarization during self-calibration. In the case of 3C 84, we were\nfortunate because the real circular polarization appeared in the jet, off the peak in the image. As\na result, zero-V self-cal could not seriously reduce or relocate the circular polarization without\ninducing larger amounts of (opposite sign) circular polarization on the map peak. We verified this\nby carefully creating detailed models of 3C 84. In doing so, we found that only the small negative\ncomponent of circular polarization in the zero-V self-cal image is (in part or in whole) an artifact\nof assuming no circular polarization during self-calibration.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nA.2.2.\n\nA Hybrid Technique: R/L Gain Transfer\n\n \u0303 makes no assumption about\nThe second self-calibration assumption ((RR + LL)/2 = I)\ncircular polarization in the source and accurately calibrates the average of R and L at a\neach antenna; however, it cannot correct the R/L antenna gains crucial for detecting circular\n \u0303 LL = I)\n \u0303 can calibrate the R/L\npolarization. The first self-calibration assumption (RR = I,\nantenna gains but may reduce or relocate real circular polarization in the process.\nA natural compromise is to solve for the R/L antenna gains only on objects which are\nbelieved not to have circular polarization, using the assumption of zero circular polarization in\nself-calibration, and to transfer these measurements to the other sources in the observation.\nIn practice, this is accomplished by first doing the complete calibration7 of the experiment\nwith no assumption made about the presence or absence of circular polarization. That is, the\nrigorous assumption (RR + LL)/2 = I \u0303 is made for all self-calibration steps. At the end of this\ncalibration, only the R/L antenna gain ratio remains to be calibrated for each antenna. Selected\nsources (which are assumed to contain no circular polarization) may then be self-calibrated with\nthe assumption RR = I \u0303 and LL = I \u0303 to find the R/L antenna gain ratios that will be applied (in\nsome averaged, smoothed form) to the remaining sources.\nInitially, one does not know which sources have circular polarization and which do not. For\nexperiments with a large number of sources that have well interleaved observations, it is possible\nto initially assume that all sources have no circular polarization. Self-calibration on each source\nwill then produce a series of R/L gain corrections that are not directly applied to the sources but\nare merged, averaged, and smoothed on some time interval long enough to span several source\nchanges. The resulting composite correction table can then be applied directly to the data with\nlittle fear that real circular polarization on any individual sources has strongly corrupted the\nresults. At this point, all the sources may be imaged in circular polarization. If some sources\nappear to have significant circular polarization, we may go back a step and construct a new gain\ntable which omits the influence of those sources.\nThe technique described here was used to produce the gain-transfer images presented in\nsection 4. In the process of developing this technique we tried a range of averaging times for the\nR/L correction table from 4 hours to 24 hours. We found that, although the 4 hour averaging time\nproduced images with the least noise, our main results were essentially independent of averaging\ntime over this range. We also found (with this range of averaging times) that we obtained\nessentially the same results when the circularly polarized sources were allowed to contribute to the\ngain table, confirming that individual source effects do not strongly influence the R/L correction\ntable if the averaging time spans several source changes.\nFigure 14 shows the R/L amplitude gain ratios for IF 2 of the 1996.74 epoch. The raw and\n7\n\nIncluding removal of any feed leakage terms.\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\naveraged corrections are both presented. The R/L gain ratios have two time scales for variation.\nThe first is a long time scale offset from unity on the order of a couple of percent. This offset\nvaries slowly over the course of several hours up to 24 hours. The second time scale for variation\nis very short, on the order of a single scan. These short time scale variations typically have an\nrms deviation from the 24 hour mean of . 2%. Our procedure for calibrating the R/L gain ratios\ncorrects the long time scale offset but cannot correct the very short time scale fluctuations about\nthis offset.\nWe can estimate the effect of these short time scale variations by assuming that the longer time\nscale offset has been correctly removed. The R/L antenna gain ratios can then be parameterized\nby a small offset, \u03b4, from unity.\n(R/L)i = 1 + \u03b4i \u2243\n\n1 + \u03b4i /2\n.\n1 \u2212 \u03b4i /2\n\n(A16)\n\nSo the RR and LL correlations are\nRi Rj\u2217 \u2243 (1 + \u03b4i /2)(1 + \u03b4j /2)(I \u0303ij + \u1e7cij )\n\n(A17)\n\nLi L\u2217j \u2243 (1 \u2212 \u03b4i /2)(1 \u2212 \u03b4j /2)(I \u0303ij \u2212 \u1e7cij )\n\n(A18)\n\nand\nThen the measured V visibilities become\n\u1e7cmeas \u2243 \u1e7cij + (\u03b4i /2 + \u03b4j /2)I \u0303ij ,\n\n(A19)\n\nBecause the \u03b4 variations are essentially uncorrelated between antennas, scans, and IFs, we\ncan estimate the errors in our fractional circular polarization, mc , measurements:\n\u2206mc \u2243 \u221a\n\n\u03b4\nNa Ns NIF\n\n(A20)\n\nwhere Na is the number of antennas, Ns is the number of scans, and NIF is the number of IFs.\nFor our experiments \u03b4 \u2243 0.02, Na = 10, Ns = 6 to 10, and NIF = 4, so we expect errors . 0.15%\nof the local total intensity in our circular polarization measurements by gain transfer. This is\nconsistent with the limits we see on sources which do not appear to have circular polarization.\n\nA.2.3.\n\nPhase-Only Mapping.\n\nWardle and Roberts (1994) suggested mapping the closure phases of a VLBI data set to detect\na circularly polarized signal. A very analogous (but simpler to implement) idea is to map only the\nphases of the parallel hand correlations. Phase-only mapping involves setting all of the amplitudes\nof the parallel hand correlations to unity and using only the phase information to construct a\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\ncircular polarization map. This method is useful because errors in the antenna amplitude gains\ndominate the error in the other techniques for making circular polarization images. By ignoring\nthe amplitudes, we look for the signal directly in the phases of the data.\nFor simple sources, phase-only images will be anti-symmetric to first order and the true\nlocation of the circular polarization signal is ambiguous. For example, consider the case of a point\ndouble (like 3C 279) with the stronger peak, I1 , taken to be at the map center and the weaker\npeak, I2 , at position (x2 , y2 ). A small amount of circular polarization, V0 , is located on either of\nthe two peaks.\nIf V0 coincides with the position of I2 (the weaker component), the phase-only map is given\nby\nVP (x, y) \u2248\n\nV0\n[\u03b4(x \u2212 x2 , y \u2212 y2 ) \u2212 \u03b4(x + x2 , y + y2 )].\n2I1\n\n(A21)\n\nIf V0 coincides with the position of I1 (the stronger component), the phase-only map is given\nby\nVP (x, y) \u2248 \u2212\n\nV0 I 2\n[\u03b4(x \u2212 x2 , y \u2212 y2 ) \u2212 \u03b4(x + x2 , y + y2 )].\n2I12\n\n(A22)\n\nThese two phase-only maps differ only in the strength of the components. Without a-priori\nknowledge of the strength or true location of V0 , it is not possible to distinguish between them.\nHowever, if we do know the true location of V0 , its strength can be deduced using these expressions.\nIt is interesting to note that relative amplitude information is preserved in phase-only\nmapping, although the phase-only images are independent of the antenna amplitude gains. This\nseeming contradiction is due to the fact that while we have forced the RR and LL correlations\nto have unit amplitude (thus eliminating any dependence on antenna amplitude gains), it is the\ntotal amplitude of these correlations which have been set to unity. The amplitudes of individual I\nand V components which conspire to form RR and LL remain in the form of ratios if the source\nstructure is more complicated than a point.\n\nA.3.\n\nBeam Squint\n\nBeam squint is a problem for any antenna with off-axis feed elements. The left and right hand\nfeeds have slightly displaced primary beams. Any pointing error at the telescope will cause one\nfeed to receive a larger signal than the other, resulting in a small, artificial amplitude difference\nbetween the RCP and LCP signals at that antenna.\nFor the VLBA at 22 GHz, a 7\" pointing error (typical for the VLBA, Napier 1995) will result\nin a 1% amplitude difference between RCP and LCP signals at an antenna (Walker, personal\ncommunication). The observations presented in this paper are at 15 GHz where the problem is\n(1.5)2 smaller due to the larger primary beams of each feed. The placement of the 15 GHz feed\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\nin VLBA antennas is also better than the 22 GHz feed as it is not parallel to the azimuthal axis\nwhere the largest pointing errors occur (Walker, personal communication).\nFortunately beam squint will not be correlated between antennas and should vary with\nazimuthal antenna rotation during the observations. Any beam squint should be a pure amplitude\ngain error at each antenna and will be completely removed by the zero-V self-cal technique\ndiscussed in A.2.1. In the gain transfer technique, beam squint effects should show up as short\nterm R/L amplitude variations and, as such, are already included in our error estimates for those\nimages. Beam squint will not affect the phases of the data, and therefore images produced by\nphase-only mapping will be independent of beam squint effects.\n\nA.4.\n\nBaseline Based Errors\n\nReal circular polarization would be completely calibrated out of a data set by baseline based\nself-calibration which assumes RR = I \u0303mod and LL = I \u0303mod . This makes it difficult to remove any\nresidual baseline based errors from the data if we wish to detect circular polarization.\nHowever, there is excellent evidence that the baseline based errors on the VLBA are\nextraordinarily small. Imaging of the nearly unresolved point source, DA 193, at 5 GHz with a\ndynamic range of better than 100,000 to 1 indicates that the baseline based errors are no larger\nthan 0.1% at that frequency (Walker 1995). In our simulations we added baseline based errors\nmuch larger than this to our model data sets and found that while they increased the noise in the\nfinal circular polarization images they did not generate a spurious circularly polarized signal.\n\nA.5.\n\nAdditional Calibration Tests\n\nThe calibration checks described in this section were conducted early-on in our investigation.\nThe results increased our confidence in our ability to calibrate for circular polarization and served\nas a basis for the more systematic tests and investigations described in the previous sections. We\nbriefly present these initial tests and results here for completeness and to provide other observers\nwith suggestions for other \"common sense\" checks when calibrating for circular polarization.\nFor epoch 1996.57, we repeated the entire calibration procedure (post fringe-fit) on the source\n3C 84 for each IF channel separately, and then omitting each antenna in turn from the array. In\nno case did the apparent circularly polarized signal change significantly. It was present in every\nIF channel, and could not be attributed to the behavior of any one antenna.\nWe also checked the effect of incorrect subtraction of antenna feed leakage (D-terms) from\nthe parallel hand data for the 1996.57 epoch of 3C 279. This was done by simply omitting the\ncorrection altogether and also by applying a completely incorrect set of D-terms. Both procedures\nincreased the noise on the zero-V self-cal image enough that one might misinterpret the real\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\ncircular polarization of the source as noise. Correct application of the D-term solutions, however,\nrevealed a clean (real) circular polarization signal in the zero-V self-cal image.\nWe conducted a similar test on 3C 84. In this case, the zero-V self-cal image created from\ndata without the D-terms removed was nearly the same as the the zero-V self-cal image created\nfrom data where we performed the proper D-term corrections. This is exactly what we expected\nfor 3C 84 which has no linear polarization to leak into the circular polarization. The total intensity\ncan still leak into the circular polarization image, but it is a much smaller effect.\nFinally, we created three model sources, similar to 3C 279 in total intensity and linear\npolarization structure, with either no initial V , V on the core, or V on the jet component.\nThese models contained thermal noise, D-term leakage, time-dependent complex gains, and\nbaseline-based errors. We carried these models through our standard calibration procedures\nand found that we were able to detect a circularly polarized signal placed in the data. Equally\nimportant, we were unable to detect a circularly polarized signal when the model contained none.\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\nREFERENCES\nBegelman, M. C., Blandford, R. D., & Rees, M. J. 1984 Rev.

V = (RR\u2212LL)/2.\nBefore self-calibration, there is significant circular polarization on the strong I component. Selfcalibration assuming no V will force RR and LL to agree with I as closely as possible by adjusting\nthe antenna gains. Circular polarization, however, is not multiplicative but additive in the RR and\nLL correlations. Adjusting the antenna gains to remove the circular polarization on the strong\ncomponent will induce circular polarization with the opposite sign on the weak component. So,\nafter self-calibration, the weak component has negative circular polarization at roughly the same\nfractional level as the original positive circular polarization on the strong component.\n\n\f\u2013 39 \u2013\n\na\n1050\n1000\n950\n1050\n1000\n950\n1050\n1000\n950\n1050\n1000\n\nMilliRatio\n\n950\n1050\n1000\n950\n1050\n1000\n950\n1050\n1000\n950\n1050\n1000\n950\n1050\n1000\n950\n1050\n1000\n\n1 BR\n\n2 FD\n\n3 HN\n\n4 KP\n\n5 LA\n\n6 MK\n\n7 NL\n\n8 OV\n\n9 PT\n\n10 SC\n\n950\n05\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\nTIME (HOURS)\n\n1/01\n\n1/06\n\nb\n1050\n1000\n950\n1050\n1000\n950\n1050\n1000\n950\n1050\n1000\n950\n1050\n\nMilliRatio\n\n1000\n950\n1050\n1000\n950\n1050\n1000\n950\n1050\n1000\n950\n1050\n1000\n950\n1050\n1000\n\n1 BR\n\n2 FD\n\n3 HN\n\n4 KP\n\n5 LA\n\n6 MK\n\n7 NL\n\n8 OV\n\n9 PT\n\n10 SC\n\n950\n05\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\nTIME (HOURS)\n\n1/01\n\n1/06\n\nFig. 14.- R/L amplitude gain ratio corrections for IF 2 of the 1996.74 epoch.
