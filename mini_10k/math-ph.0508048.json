Here we develop the analysis for the Dirac equation\n(\n\n\u03c8\u0307(x, t) = [\u2212\u03b1 * \u2207 \u2212 i\u03b2m] \u03c8(x, t), x \u2208 IR3 ,\n\u03c8(x, 0) = \u03c80 (x),\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere \u2207 = (\u22021 , \u22022 , \u22023 ) , \u2202k = \u2202/\u2202xk , m > 0 , \u03b1 = (\u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b13 ) , \u03b1k and \u03b2 are 4 \u00d7 4 Dirac\nmatrices (see (2.12), (2.13)). The solution \u03c8(x, t) \u2208 C 4 for (x, t) \u2208 IR4 .\nIt is assumed that the initial data \u03c80 (x) are given by a random element of the function\n0\nspace H \u2261 Hloc\n(IR3 ) of states with finite local energy, see Definition 2.1 below. The distribution of \u03c80 is a zero-mean probability measure \u03bc0 satisfying some additional assumptions,\nsee Conditions S1-S3 below. Denote by \u03bct , t \u2208 IR , the measure on H giving the distribution of the random solution \u03c8(t) of problem (1.1). We identify the complex and real spaces\nC 4 \u2261 IR8 , and \u2297 stands for the tensor product of real vectors. The correlation functions of\nthe initial measure are supposed to be translation-invariant,\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nQ0 (x, y) := E \u03c80 (x) \u2297 \u03c80 (y) = q0 (x \u2212 y), x, y \u2208 IR3 .\n\n(1.2)\n\nWe also assume that the initial mean charge density is finite,\ne0 := E|\u03c80 (x)|2 = tr q0 (0) < \u221e, x \u2208 IR3 .\n\n(1.3)\n\nFinally, assume that the measure \u03bc0 satisfies a mixing condition of a Rosenblatt- or IbragimovLinnik type, which means that\n\u03c80 (x) and \u03c80 (y) are asymptotically independent as |x \u2212 y| \u2192 \u221e.\n\n(1.4)\n\nOur main result gives the (weak) convergence of \u03bct to a limit measure \u03bc\u221e ,\n\u03bct \u21c1 \u03bc\u221e , t \u2192 \u221e,\n\n(1.5)\n\nwhich is an equilibrium Gaussian measure on H . A similar convergence holds for t \u2192 \u2212\u221e\nbecause our system is time-reversible. Explicit formulas (2.17) for the correlation functions\nof \u03bc\u221e are given.\nTo prove the convergence (1.5) we follow the strategy of [1]-[5]. There are three steps.\nI. The family of measures \u03bct , t \u2265 0 , is weakly compact in an appropriate Fr\u00e9chet space.\nII. The correlation functions converge to a limit,\nQt (x, y) \u2261\n\nZ\n\n\u03c8(x) \u2297 \u03c8(y) \u03bct(\u03c8) \u2192 Q\u221e (x, y), t \u2192 \u221e.\n\n(1.6)\n\nIII.

Then the Prokhorov condition follows from the Sobolev embedding\ntheorem by Chebyshev's inequality. Property II is derived from an analysis of oscillatory\nintegrals arising in the Fourier transform. However, the Fourier transform by itself is insufficient to prove Property III. We derive it by using an explicit representation of the solution in\nthe coordinate space with the help of the Bernstein' \"room-corridor\" technique by a method\nof [1]-[5]. The method gives a representation of the solution as a sum of weakly dependent\nrandom variables. Then (1.5) follows from the Ibragimov-Linnik central limit theorem under\na Lindeberg-type condition. We sketch the proofs by using the technique of [1].\nThe paper is organized as follows. The main result is stated in Section 2. The compactness (Property I) is established in Section 3, the convergence (1.6) in Section 4, and the\nconvergence (1.7) in Sections 5.\n\n2\n\nMain results\n\nLet us describe our results more precisely.\n\n2.1\n\nNotation\n\nWe assume that the initial date \u03c80 in (1.1) is complex-valued vector function belonging to\nthe phase space H .\n0\n(IR3 , C 4 ) the Fr\u00e9chet space of complex-valued functions\nDefinition 2.1 Denote by H \u2261 Hloc\n\u03c8(x) , endowed with local energy seminorms\n\nk\u03c8k20,R \u2261\n\nZ\n\n|\u03c8(x)|2 dx < \u221e, \u2200R > 0.\n\n(2.1)\n\n|x|<R\n\nProposition 2.2 (i) For any \u03c80 \u2208 H there exists a unique solution \u03c8(*, t) \u2208 C(IR, H) to\nCauchy problem (1.1).\n(ii) For any t \u2208 IR , the operator U(t) : \u03c80 7\u2192 \u03c8(*, t) is continuous in H .\nProposition 2.2 follows from [10, Thms.

[9, Lemma 17.2.3]) that\n|q0ij (z)| \u2264 Ce0 \u03c61/2 (|z|),\n\nz \u2208 IR3 ,\n\ni, j = 1, . . . , 8.\n\n(4.8)\n\nThe mixing coefficient \u03c6 is bounded, and hence relations (4.8) and (2.11) imply (4.7),\nZ\n\nIR3\n\n|q0ij (z)|p\n\ndz \u2264\n\nCep0\n\nZ\n\n\u03c6\n\np/2\n\n(|z|) dz \u2264 C1\n\nZ\u221e\n\nr 2 \u03c61/2 (r) dr < \u221e.\n\n0\n\nIR3\n\nBy Bohner's theorem, q\u03020ij is a nonnegative matrix-valued measure on IR3 , and condition S2\nimplies that the total measure q\u03020 (IR3 ) is finite. On the other hand, relation (4.7) for p = 2\ngives q\u03020ij \u2208 L2 (IR3 ) . Hence, q\u03020ij \u2208 L1 (IR3 ) .\n\u2737\nLet us apply this lemma to the oscillatory integrals entering (4.6). The convergence (4.2)\nfollows from (4.6) by the Lebesgue-Riemann theorem. This completes the proof of Proposition 4.1.\n\u2737\nRelation (4.7) for p = 1 implies now that q\u03020 (k) is bounded. Hence, the explicit formula\n(2.17) implies the following assertion.\nij\n(k) , i, j = 1, . . . , 8 , are bounded.\nCorollary 4.3 All matrix elements q\u0302\u221e\n\n5\n\nConvergence of characteristic functionals\n\nTo prove Proposition 2.8 for the general case of a non-Gaussian measure \u03bc0 , we develop a\nversion of Bernstein's \"room - corridor\" method of [1]-[4]: (i) we use an integral representation for the solutions of (1.1), (ii) divide the region of the integration into \"rooms\" and\n\"corridors\" and (iii) evaluate their contribution. As the result, the value hU(t)\u03c80 , \u03c6i for\n\u03c6 \u2208 D is represented as the sum of weakly dependent random variables. Then we apply\nBernstein's \"rooms-corridor\" method and the Lindeberg central limit theorem.\n(i) We first evaluate the inner product hU(t)\u03c80 , \u03c6i in (2.19) by using duality arguments.\nFor t \u2208 IR , introduce a \"formal adjoint\" operators U \u2032 (t) from the space D to a suitable\nspace of distributions. For example,\nh\u03c8, U \u2032 (t)\u03c6i = hU(t)\u03c8, \u03c6i, \u03c6 \u2208 D, \u03c8 \u2208 H.\n\n(5.1)\n\nWrite \u03c6(*, t) = U \u2032 (t)\u03c6 . Then (5.1) can be represented as\nh\u03c8(t), \u03c6i = h\u03c80 , \u03c6(*, t)i, t \u2208 IR.\n\n(5.2)\n\nThe adjoint groups admit a convenient description (see Lemma 5.1 for the group U \u2032 (t) ).\nLemma 5.1 For \u03c6 \u2208 D , the function U \u2032 (t)\u03c6 = \u03c6(x, t) is the solution of\n\u03c6\u0307(x, t) = (\u03b1 * \u2207 + i\u03b2m)\u03c6(x, t),\n9\n\n\u03c6(x, 0) = \u03c6(x).\n\n(5.3)\n\n\fProof. Differentiating (5.1) with respect to t for \u03c8, \u03c6 \u2208 D , we obtain\nh\u03c8, U\u0307 \u2032 (t)\u03c6i = hU\u0307(t)\u03c8, \u03c6i.\n\n(5.4)\n\nThe group U(t) has the generator A = \u2212\u03b1 * \u2207 \u2212 i\u03b2m. Therefore, the generator of U \u2032 (t) is\nthe conjugate operator\nA\u2032 = \u03b1 * \u2207 + i\u03b2m.\n(5.5)\nHence, relation (5.3) holds indeed with \u03c6\u0307 = A\u2032\u03c6 .\n\n\u2737\n\nRemark 5.2 Comparing (5.3) and (1.1), we see that \u03c6(x, t) = U \u2032 (t)\u03c6 can be represented\nas a convolution (cf (3.3)), namely,\n\u03c6(*, t) = Rt \u2217 \u03c6,\n\nRt := (\u2202t + \u03b1 * \u2207 + im\u03b2)Et .\n\n(5.6)\n\n(ii) Introduce a \"room-corridor\" partition of IR3 . For a given t > 0 , choose dt \u2265 1 and\n\u03c1t > 0 such that \u03c1t \u223c t1\u2212\u03b4 with some \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 1) and dt \u223c t/ln t , as t \u2192 \u221e. Set ht = dt +\u03c1t\nand\naj = jht , bj = aj + dt , j \u2208 ZZ.\n(5.7)\nWe refer to the slabs Rtj = {x \u2208 IR3 : aj \u2264 x3 \u2264 bj } as \"rooms\" and to Ctj = {x \u2208\nIR3 : bj \u2264 x3 \u2264 aj+1 } as \"corridors\". Here x = (x1 , x2 , x3 ) , the symbol dt stands for the\nwidth of a room, and \u03c1t for that of a corridor.\nDenote by \u03c7r the indicator of the interval [0, dt ] and by \u03c7c that of [dt , ht ] , which means\nthat\nX\n(\u03c7r (s \u2212 jh) + \u03c7c (s \u2212 jh)) = 1 for (almost all) s \u2208 IR.\nj\u2208Z\nZ\n\nThe following decomposition holds:\nh\u03c80 , \u03c6(*, t)i =\n\nX\n\n(h\u03c80 , \u03c7jr \u03c6(*, t)i + h\u03c80 , \u03c7jc \u03c6(*, t)i),\n\n(5.8)\n\nj\u2208Z\nZ\n\nwhere \u03c7jr := \u03c7r (x3 \u2212 jh) and \u03c7jc := \u03c7c (x3 \u2212 jh) . Consider the random variables rtj and cjt\ngiven by\nrtj = h\u03c80 , \u03c7jr \u03c6(*, t)i, cjt = h\u03c80 , \u03c7jc \u03c6(*, t)i,\nj \u2208 ZZ.\n(5.9)\nThen (5.8) and (5.2) imply\nhU(t)\u03c80 , \u03c6i =\n\nX\n\n(rtj + cjt ).\n\n(5.10)\n\nj\u2208Z\nZ\n\nThe series in (5.10) is in fact a finite sum. Indeed, for the support of \u03c6 we have\nsupp \u03c6 \u2282 Br\n\nfor some r > 0.\n\nThen, by the convolution representation (5.6), the support of the function \u03c6(*, t) at t > 0\nis a subset of an \"inflated future cone\"\nsupp \u03c6 \u2282 {(x, t) \u2208 IR3 \u00d7 IR+ : |x| \u2264 t + r},\n\n(5.11)\n\nwhereas Rt (x) is supported by the 'future cone' |x| \u2264 t . The latter fact follows from (5.6)\nand from Remark 3.1. Finally, it follows from (5.9) that\nrtj = cjt = 0\n\nfor\n\njht + t < \u2212r\n10\n\nand for\n\njht \u2212 t > r.\n\n(5.12)\n\n\fTherefore, the series (5.10) becomes a sum,\nhU(t)\u03c80 , \u03c6i =\n\nNt\nX\n\n(rtj + cjt ), Nt \u223c\n\n\u2212Nt\n\nt\n.\nht\n\n(5.13)\n\nLemma 5.3 Let Conditions S0\u2013S3 hold. Then the following bounds hold for t > 1 :\nE|rtj |2 \u2264 C(\u03c6) dt /t, E|cjt |2 \u2264 C(\u03c6) \u03c1t /t, j \u2208 ZZ.\n\n(5.14)\n\nProof. We discuss the first bound in (5.14) only, because the other can be proved in a\nsimilar way. Rewrite the LHS of (5.14) as the integral of correlation functions. We obtain\nE|rtj |2 = h\u03c7jr (x3 )\u03c7jr (y3 )q0 (x \u2212 y), \u03c6(x, t) \u2297 \u03c6(y, t)i.\n\n(5.15)\n\nThe following uniform bound holds (cf. [11, Thm. XI.17 (b)]):\nsup |\u03c6(x, t)| = O(t\u22123/2 ), t \u2192 \u221e.\n\n(5.16)\n\nx\u2208IR3\n\nIn fact, (5.6) and (3.2) imply that the function \u03c6(x, t) can be represented written as the\nsum\nX Z \u2212i(kx\u00b1\u03c9t) \u00b1\ne\na (\u03c9)\u03c6\u0302(k) dk,\n(5.17)\n\u03c6(x, t) =\n\u00b1\n\nIR3\n\nwhere a\u00b1 (\u03c9) is a matrix whose entries are linear functions of \u03c9 or 1/\u03c9 . Let us prove the\nasymptotics (5.16) along each ray x = vt + x0 with |v| \u2264 1 . The asymptotic relation thus\nobtained must hold uniformly in x \u2208 IR3 by (5.11). By (5.17) we have\n\u03c6(vt + x0 , t) =\n\nXZ\n\u00b1\n\ne\u2212i(kv\u00b1\u03c9)t\u2212ikx0 a\u00b1 (\u03c9)\u03c6\u0302(k) dk.\n\n(5.18)\n\nIR3\n\nThis is a sum of oscillatory integrals with the phase functions \u03c6\u00b1 (k) = kv \u00b1 \u03c9(k) . Each\nfunction has two stationary points which are solutions of the equation v = \u2213\u2207\u03c9(k) if\n|v| < 1 , and has none if |v| \u2265 1 . The phase functions are nondegenerate, i.e.,\n\u2202 2 \u03c6\u00b1 (k)\ndet\n\u2202ki \u2202kj\n\n!3\n\nk \u2208 IR3 .\n\n6= 0,\n\n(5.19)\n\ni,j=1\n\nFinally, \u03c6\u0302(k) is smooth and rapidly decays at infinity. Therefore, \u03c6(vt + x0 , t) = O(t\u22123/2 )\naccording to the standard method of stationary phase, see [7].\nAccording to (5.11) and (5.16), it follows from (5.15) that\nE|rtj |2\n\n\u22123\n\n\u2264 Ct\n\nZ\n\n\u03c7jr (x3 )kq0 (x\n\nZ\n\n\u22123\n\n\u2212 y)k dxdy = Ct\n\n|x|\u2264t+r\n\n|x|\u2264t+r\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03c7jr (x3 )dx\n\nZ\n\nkq0 (z)kdz,\n\n(5.20)\n\nIR3\n\n\u0011\n\nwhere kq0 (z)k stands for the norm of the matrix q0ij (z) . Therefore, relation (5.14) follows\nfor kq0 (*)k \u2208 L1 (IR3 ) by (4.7).\n\u2737\nHence, the rest of the proof of Proposition 2.8 is the same as that in the case of the\nKlein-Gordon equation, [1, p.20-25]. The proof of Theorem A is complete.\n11\n\n\fReferences\n[1] T.V. Dudnikova, A.I. Komech, E.A. Kopylova, Yu.M. Suhov, On convergence to equilibrium distribution, I.
