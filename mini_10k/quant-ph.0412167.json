These states are recursively constructed by means of an auxiliary density matrix \u03c1 on\na matrix algebra B and a completely positive map E : A \u2297 B \u2192 B, where A is the spin 2 \u00d7 2\nmatrix algebra. General structural results for the infinite chain are therefore obtained by explicit calculations in (finite) matrix algebras. In particular, we study not only the entanglement\nshared by nearest-neighbours, but also, differently from previous works [3], the entanglement\nshared between connected regions of the spin-chain. This range of possible applications is illustrated and the maximal concurrence C = \u221a12 [4] for the entanglement of connected regions\ncan actually be reached.\n\nThe recent developments in quantum information and computation theory are witnessing\nan increasing interest in the entanglement properties of multi-qubit systems like quantum\nspin-chains, correlated electrons and interacting bosons. These systems had so far been studied in condensed matter physics especially in relations to their critical behaviour in phasetransitions [5]. With its emergence as a precious resource for quantum computation and\ncommunication tasks, entanglement is now investigated in condensed matter physics, too; on\none hand to detect, extract and manipulate it, on the other hand to understand its role in\nsolid state phenomena [6\u201313].\nThe entanglement properties of the class of states of quantum spin chains known as MatrixProduct States (MPS) [1], have been proved powerful tools in density matrix renormalization\ngroups techniques [14] and in universal quantum computation to show the equivalence of\nteleportation-based and one-way quantum computation [15]. They can be also achieved by\nsequential generation [16]. Actually, these states were originally introduced in [2] as Finitely\nCorrelated States (FCS) and their properties were there studied in great detail; in particular, it\nwas showed that FCS can be implemented as ground states of Hamiltonians with short range\ninteraction (see also [15]). This motivates the study of entanglement in FCS both from the\npoint of view of the large variety of scaling laws provided and from the point of view of the\npossible physical applications.\nc EDP Sciences\n\n\f2\n\nEUROPHYSICS LETTERS\n\nTwo main different approaches have emerged: one dealing with the scaling behaviour of\nentanglement-sharing between various subsets of localized spins [17, 18, 20, 21], the other one\nstudying how much entanglement can be localized on two distant spins by measuring the\nothers [19,22]. In this Letter we choose the first approach and study the entanglement of FCS\nby means of their recursive structure [2], that is by studying the specific completely positive\nmaps between finite dimensional algebras and finite dimensional density matrices on which\nit is based. This provides a rich phenomenology of total translation invariant states over\ninfinite spin chains whose entanglement properties are nevertheless determined by, and can\nconsequently be studied in a finite-dimensional setting. Thus, we are able to compare nearest\nneighbours with non-nearest neighbours entanglement or, more generally, to analytically study\nthe entanglement between different subsets of lattice points. In particular, we shall give a\ngeneral necessary condition for one spin being entangled with a subset of others and prove\nthat in some cases this condition is also sufficient. Finally, we show that entanglement sharing\ncan achieve its maximum in the sense of [4].\nConstruction of translation invariant FCS: We will denote by AZ an infinite spinchain, the spins at sites i \u2208 Z being described by the algebra (A)i = M2 of 2 \u00d7 2 complex\nmatrices. The infinite algebra AZ arises as a suitable limit of the local tensor-product algebras\nA[\u2212n,n] := \u2297nj=\u2212n (A)j . Any state \u03c9 over AZ is specified by density matrices \u03c1[1,n] defining\nthe action of \u03c9 as an expectation over local operators A[1,n] \u2208 A[1,n] :\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03c9(A[1,n] ) = Tr[1,n] \u03c1[1,n] A[1,n] .\n(1)\nThe \u03c1[1,n] 's must satisfy the compatibility conditions\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\nTrn+1 \u03c1[1,n+1] A[1,n] \u2297 1n+1 = Tr \u03c1[1,n] A[1,n] ,\nwhereas, translation-invariance requires\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\nTrn+1 \u03c1[1,n+1] 11 \u2297 A[2,n+1] = Tr \u03c1[1,n] A[1,n] .\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nThe class of translation-invariant FCS over AZ is defined by a triple (B, \u03c1, E) where B is a b \u00d7 b\nmatrix algebra B, \u03c1 \u2208 B a density matrix and E : A \u2297 B 7\u2192 B a completely positive unital\nmap, which in Kraus-Stinespring form reads\nX\nVj (A \u2297 B)Vj\u2020 , Vj : C2 \u2297 Cb 7\u2192 Cb ,\n(4)\nE(A \u2297 B) =\nj\n\nwith A \u2208 A and B \u2208 B.

The advantage of the abstract structure presented above emerges in that the\n\n\f4\n\nEUROPHYSICS LETTERS\n\ntotal state over the chain is determined by the triple (B, E, \u03c1), so that properties like the\nmaximal entanglement shared by nearest neighbours in a translation invariant chain, and,\nmore generally, the entanglement between different subsets of lattice points, can be studied\nby means of that triple only.\nDistribution of the entanglement along the chain: As a measure of the entanglement\nof a state \u03bd12 over the tensor product algebra N1 \u2297 N2 , we shall use the entanglement of\nformation [25]\n\u0011o\n\u0010\nnX\nj\n,\n(13)\n\u03bb\nS\n\u03bd\n|\n`\nN\ninf\nEN1 \u2297N2 (\u03bd12 ) =\nj\n1\n12\nP\n\u03bd12 =\n\nj\n\nj\n\u03bbj \u03bd12\n\nj\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\nj\nj\n|`N1 the von\nis a convex decomposition into pure states and S \u03bd12\nwhere \u03bd12 = j \u03bbj \u03bd12\nNeumann entropy of their restrictions to the subalgebra N1 , namely of the state obtained by\ntracing over the second factor, the density matrix representing the expectation functional \u03bd12 .\nIt turns out that\nP\n\nE(A)1 \u2297(A)p (\u03c9) \u2264 E(A)1 \u2297A[p,n] (\u03c9) \u2264 EA\u2297B (\u03c1A\u2297B ) .\n\n(14)\n\nThe proof of this fact follows from a slight generalization of an argument in [24]. Let N3\nbe another algebra, \u03bd13 a state over N1 \u2297 N3 and \u0393 : N2 7\u2192 N3 a unital (\u0393(1N2 ) = 1N3 )\ncompletely positive map. Then, \u03bd12 = \u03bd13 \u25e6 (idN1 \u2297 \u0393) is a state over N1 \u2297 N2 , where \u25e6\ndenotes the composition of the expectation functional \u03bd13 with the completely positive unital\nmap idN1 \u2297 \u0393. As the decompositions of \u03bd12 induced by those of \u03bd13 are not all possible ones,\nit follows that EN1 \u2297N2 (\u03bd12 ) is bounded from above by\n\u0011o\n\u0010\nnX\nj\n.\n(15)\n\u03bbj S \u03bd13\n\u25e6 (idN1 \u2297 \u0393) |`N1\ninf j\nP\n\u03bd13 =\n\nj\n\n\u03bbj \u03bd13\n\nj\n\nj\n\u03bd13\n\nFrom the unitality of \u0393, the states\n\u25e6 (idN1 \u2297 \u0393) restricted to N1 , that is evaluating mean\nj\nthemselves.\nvalues of operators of the form N1 \u2297 1N2 , coincide with the restrictions of \u03bd13\nThus, EN1 \u2297N2 (\u03bd12 ) \u2264 EN1 \u2297N3 (\u03bd13 ). The first inequality in the hierarchy (14) follows by\ntaking N1 = (A)1 , N2 = (A)p , N3 = A[p,n] and as \u0393 the natural embedding of (A)p into\nA[p,n] . The second one, by choosing N1 = (A)1 , N2 = A[p,n] , N3 = B and \u0393 = G : A[p,n] 7\u2192 B;\nin fact, \u03c9 |`(A)1 \u2297 A[p,n] = \u03c1A\u2297B \u25e6 idA \u2297 G, see also Eq. (12). Thus, the general necessary\ncondition follows that, for (A)1 to be entangled with A[p,n] , p > 1, the state \u03c1A\u2297B must\nbe entangled over A \u2297 B. Translation-invariance makes this necessary condition independent\nof rigid shifts of the two algebras; also, though the next examples go in the right direction,\nunfortunately, there is so far no general argument for its sufficiency namely that entanglement\nbetween A and B should imply entanglement between A and some A[p,n] .\nExamples: Because A = B = M2 , we study the concurrence [26] of which the entanglement\nof formation is a monotonically increasing function. The concurrence of \u03c1 is given by C(\u03c1) =\nmax{0, \u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bb3 \u2212 \u03bb4 }, where \u03bbj are the square roots of the eigenvalues in decreasing order\nof the matrix \u03c1e\n\u03c1 where \u03c1e = (\u03c3y \u2297 \u03c3y )\u03c1\u2217 (\u03c3y \u2297 \u03c3y ) and \u03c1\u2217 denotes complex conjugation in the\nstandard basis.

The same happens to the state of one site with the rest \u03c1A\u2297B , namely,\nif s2 \u2212 4c6 < 0, that is for 0 \u2264 \u03c6 < \u03c0/4, this state is surely not positive under partial\ntransposition.\nA finer picture can be obtained by looking at the concurrences: CA\u2297B := C(\u03c1A\u2297B ) =\n| sin 2\u03c6 cos(2\u03c6)| vanishes at \u03c6 = \u03c0/4, 5\u03c0/4, while C12 := C(\u03c112 ), though explicitly computable,\nis not as easily readable. Their behaviours as functions of \u03b1 = sin(2\u03c6) are reported in Figure\n1(a) which shows firstly that, in agreement with (16), CA\u2297B \u2265 C12 and secondly that \u03c1A\u2297B is\nentangled whenever \u03c112 is entangled, namely for all sin(2\u03c6) 6= 0, \u00b11.\nAnother finitely correlated state is given by choosing\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\np\nac as\n0 1\nv1 =\n, v2 = 1 \u2212 a2\n, 0\u2264a\u22641,\n(21)\n\u2212s c\n0 0\n\n\f6\n\nEUROPHYSICS LETTERS\n\nwith s = sin \u03c6 and c = cos \u03c6.

Namely, nearestneighbours are entangled if the state of one site with the rest \u03c1A\u2297B is entangled, but we do not\nknow if entanglement of one site with rest always implies nearest neighbours entanglement.\nWe believe this to be peculiar of our choice of B: since it is two dimensional both \u03c112 and\n\u03c1A\u2297B have rank 2 and separable density matrices of rank 2 have 0 measure.\nWhen three qubits share equal entanglement, then the maximum entanglement of one\nqubit with each of the two other qubits is the sum of the squares of the two concurrences\nwhich\n\u221a is less than or equal to one [4]. Thus nearest neighbour concurrence cannot exceed\n1/ 2, but it is an open problem whether this upper bound can be achieved by an entangled\nchain. In [3] an entangled chain is considered in a translational-invariant state with nearestneighbours states as in (23) but with \u03b1 = 0 and an upper bound for shared entanglement\ncorresponding to a greater concurrence C12 = 0.434467.\nThe translation invariant state over the system A[\u2212\u221e,\u22121] \u2297 A0 \u2297 A[1,\u221e] can be defined with\n\u1e20 \u2297 1 \u2297 G mapping the system into B \u2297 A \u2297 B. Now we have a effectively three qubit state\nsharing equal amount of entanglement and due to the considerations in [4] the upper limit for\nthe concurrence is given by \u221a12 .
