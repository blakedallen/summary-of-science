There a quantum algorithm is expressed in a form\nof a unitary matrix\n\"\n#\nZ\ni T\nUalg = T exp \u2212\nH(\u03b3(t))dt ,\n(1)\n~ 0\nwhere T stands for time-ordered product, \u03b3(t) denotes\ncollectively the control parameters of the Hamiltonian H\nat time t. This unitary matrix is often implemented in\nterms of so-called elementary gates, such as U(2) gates\nand CNOT gates [3, 4, 5]. It is possible, instead, to\ndirectly implement a given unitary matrix without decomposing it into these elementary gates. It is expected\nthat this will reduce the execution time required in general. One method for direct implementation is to employ\nnumerical optimization of the control parameters of the\nHamiltonian [6, 7, 8]. The other method is to use the\nCartan decomposition of the group SU(2n ), to which an\nn-qubit matrix representation of a quantum algorithm\nbelongs [9, 10]. The latter approach, which is adopted\nhere, is successfully demonstrated recently using an NMR\nquantum computer, whose pseudopure state is generated\nby cyclic permutations of state population [11]. It should\nbe noted that exact optimal implementation of a quantum algorithm has been achieved in holonomic quantum\ncomputation in an idealized case [12].\nA warp-drive is a fictitious gadget with which two remote points in space are connected [13]. It is the purpose\nof the present Letter to demonstrate, both theoretically\nand experimentally, that a similar technique may be employed to shorten the execution time of a quantum algorithm. A time optimal implementation of the quantum\n\nalgorithm is equivalent to navigating along the time optimal path from the identity operator to the point Ualg\nin SU(2n ) by tuning the parameters \u03b3(t) in the Hamiltonian. We show below that an additional permutation\nmatrix W of the basis vectors, when added after Ualg ,\nsends it to a point W Ualg near the identity matrix I\nso that it takes a shorter time to follow the time optimal path connecting I with W Ualg than I with Ualg , see\nFig. 1. Therefore we have \"warp-driven\" Ualg to W Ualg\nby adding W . Although it might seem counterintuitive\nthat the execution time is reduced by adding an extra\ngate, this is the case since the unitary group SU(2n ) is\ncompact. Let us consider navigating on a sphere S 2 ,\nwhich is also a compact space. Suppose we leave from\n\nI\nWUalg\n\nW\nUalg\nFIG. 1: Conceptual diagram showing the effect of a warpdrive gate W in a compact space SU(4). A matrix Ualg is\nsent to W Ualg which is reachable from the unit matrix I in a\nshorter execution time. The curves connecting these matrices\nrepresent time optimal paths.\n\n\f2\na point O on the equator toward west. Then we will\neventually arrive at the antipodal point. The distance\nbetween O and us will be shorter and shorter as we further circumnavigate the sphere. This is what happens\nwhen an extra gate is added.\nIn an NMR quantum computer, a one-qubit operation\nmay be carried out in a short time on the order 10 \u03bcs\nwhile a two-qubit entangling operation takes time typically \u223c 10 ms. Thus one-qubit operation time may be\nignored in estimating the overall execution time. Let us\nconsider a molecule with two heteronucleus spins for definiteness, whose Hamiltonian, in the rotating frame with\nrespective Larmor frequency, is\nH(\u03b3) = \u2212\u03c911 [cos \u03c61 (\u03c3x \u2297 I2 /2) + sin \u03c61 (\u03c3y \u2297 I2 /2)]\n\u2212\u03c912 [cos \u03c62 (I2 \u2297 \u03c3x /2) + sin \u03c62 (I2 \u2297 \u03c3y /2)]\n+2\u03c0J\u03c3z \u2297 \u03c3z /4,\n(2)\nwhere \u03c91i and \u03c6i are the control parameters denoting\nthe amplitude and the angle in the xy-plane of the external rf fields, respectively. Above J denotes the spin-spin\ncoupling constant. Typically we have \u03c91i \u226b J, which\njustifies the above assumption of negligible one-qubit operation time compared to two-qubit operation time. Neglecting one-qubit operation time in evaluating the execution time amounts to identifying the matrices U1 and\nU2 which differ by an element of K \u2261 SU(2) \u2297 SU(2).\nThus the relevant space for evaluating the time optimal path is the coset space SU(4)/SU(2) \u2297 SU(2). To\nfind the time optimal path connecting the unit matrix I\nand the matrix Ualg , therefore, amounts to finding the\ntime optimal path connecting cosets [I] and [Ualg ], where\n[U ] \u2261 {kU |k \u2208 K}. The Lie algebra su(4) of SU(4) is\ndecomposed as su(4) = k \u2295 p [14], where\nk = Span({iI \u2297 \u03c3j /2, i\u03c3j \u2297 I/2}), (j = x, y, z) (3)\n\np = k\u22a5 = Span({i\u03c3j \u2297 \u03c3k /4}), (j, k = x, y, z). (4)\nNote that they satisfy the commutation relations\n[k, k] \u2282 k,\n\n[p, k] \u2282 p,\n\n[p, p] \u2282 k.\n\n(5)\n\nThe decomposition of a Lie algebra g into k and p, satisfying the above commutation relation, is called the\nCartan decomposition. The Cartan subalgebra h =\nSpan({i\u03c3j \u2297 \u03c3j /4}) \u2282 p plays an important role in the\nfollowing construction. A general theorem of Lie algebras\nproves that any element Ualg \u2208 SU(4) has a KP decomposition Ualg = kp, k \u2208 K \u2261 exp k and p \u2208 P \u2261 exp p.\nMoreover, any matrix p \u2208 P is rewritten in the conjugate\nform p = k1\u2020 hk1 , where k1 \u2208 K and h is an element of\nthe Cartan subgroup H of SU(4),\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f2\nX \u03b1j\n\u03c3j \u2297 \u03c3j \uf8f8 \u03b1j \u2208 R .\nH \u2261 exp h = exp \uf8edi\n\uf8fe\n\uf8f3\n4\nj=x,y,z\n\n(6)\nTherefore we have a corresponding Cartan decomposition for a group element as Ualg = k2 hk1 , where ki \u2208 K\n\nand h \u2208 H. The implementation of a quantum algorithm based on a Cartan decomposition requires shorter\nexecution time in general [9, 10, 11].\nTo be more concrete, let us consider implementing twoqubit Grover's database search algorithm Uij with an\nNMR quantum computer. The data is encoded in one\nof the basis vectors |00i, |01i, |10i, |11i and the gate Uij\npicks out a particular binary basis vector |iji as a \"target\nfile\" [15, 16]. Here we restrict ourselves within U10 which\npicks out the file |10i with a single step. The unitary\nmatrix representing this algorithm takes the form\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0 1 0 0\n\uf8ec 0 0 0 \u22121 \uf8f7\n.\n(7)\nU10 = \uf8ed\n\u22121 0 0 0 \uf8f8\n0 0 \u22121 0\nThe Cartan decomposition of an arbitrary U \u2208 SU(4) is\ncarried out explicitly as follows. We first introduce the\nBell basis [17]\n\u221a\n|\u03a80 i = (1/\u221a 2)(|00i + |11i),\n|\u03a81 i = (i/ \u221a2)(|01i + |10i),\n(8)\n|\u03a82 i = (1/\u221a 2)(|01i \u2212 |10i),\n|\u03a83 i = (i/ 2)(|00i \u2212 |11i).\n\nThe transformation rule of a matrix U with respect to the\nstandard binary basis |00i, |01i, |10i, |11i into that with\nthe Bell basis |\u03a8i i is U \u2192 UB \u2261 Q\u2020 U Q, where\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n1 0 0 i\n1 \uf8ec0 i 1 0 \uf8f7\n(9)\nQ= \u221a \uf8ed\n\uf8f8.\n2 0 i \u22121 0\n1 0 0 \u2212i\n\nThe matrix Q defines an isomorphism between K =\nSU(2) \u2297 SU(2) and SO(4) and is used to classify twoqubit gates [17, 18]. Namely, it is easy to verify that\nQ\u2020 kQ \u2208 SO(4) for k \u2208 K. Moreover, Q diagonalizes the elements of the Cartan subgroup, viz Q\u2020 hQ =\ndiag(ei\u03b80 , ei\u03b81 , ei\u03b82 , ei\u03b83 ) for h \u2208 H. Therefore we find for\nU = k2 hk1 that\nUB = Q\u2020 U Q = Q\u2020 k2 Q * Q\u2020 hQ * Q\u2020 k2 Q = O2 hD O1 ,\nwhere Oi \u2261 Q\u2020 ki Q \u2208 SO(4) and hD \u2261 Q\u2020 hQ is a diagonal matrix. From UBT UB = O1T h2D O1 , we notice that\nUBT UB is diagonalized by O1 and its eigenvalues form\nthe diagonal elements of h2D . Finally O2 is found as\nO2 = UB (hD O1 )\u22121 .\nWe apply the above strategy to find the Cartan decomposition U10 = k2 hk1 . An example of the time optimal\ncontrol is\nk1 = I2 \u2297 I2 ,\nh = ei(\u03c0/4)(\u03c3x \u2297\u03c3x \u2212\u03c3y \u2297\u03c3y ) ,\nk2 = e\n\n\u2212i(\u03c0/4)\u03c3z\n\n\u2297e\n\n\u221a\ni(\u03c0/2 2)(\u03c3x +\u03c3y )\n\n(10)\n.\n\nTo implement this decomposition with an NMR quantum\ncomputer, such terms as ei(\u03c0/4)(\u03c3x \u2297\u03c3x ) must be rewritten\n\n\f3\nTABLE I: time optimal pulse sequences for Grover's algorithm U10 and the warp-driven algorithm, W4 U10 .

The number of pulses is reduced from\n10 to 4 and the execution time is halved by adding the extra gate W4 .\nGate\nPulse sequence\nExecution Time\nU10 1: X (1/2J) Xm\nY\n(1/2J) X\nYm\n1/J\n2: X (1/2J) Xm\nYm\n(1/2J) Y Pi(\u03c0/4)\nW4 U10 1:\nXm Pi(\u2212\u03c0/4) (1/2J) X\n1/2J\n2:\n(1/2J) Pi(\u03c0)\n\nin favor of the subset of generators of SU(4) in the Hamiltonian (1).

We call such gates warp-drive\ngates. Since a matrix Ualg is an element of a compact\ngroup U(2n ), there always exist such warp-drive gates\nwhich will reduce the execution time. In the present\nwork, we choose the permutation matrices of the binary\nbasis vectors as candidates for such gates. Since there\nare four basis vectors, there are 4! = 24 permutation matrices. Note that we are not required to examine all of 24\npermutations since 18 of them are obtained by applying\none-qubit rotations on the following six permutations:\n12\n21\n,\n, W2 = UCNOT\nW0 = I4 , W1 = UCNOT\n12\n21\nW3 = USWAP , W4 = Ucp \u2261 UCNOT UCNOT ,\n\n(12)\n\n2\n21\n12\nW5 = Ucp\n\u2261 UCNOT\nUCNOT\n,\n\nij\nis\nwhere USWAP represents the swap gate and UCNOT\nthe CNOT gate whose control bit is i while the target\n2\nbit is j. The matrices Ucp and Ucp\nhave been utilized\nto cyclically permute the state populations to generate\npseudopure states [19].\nWe have optimized the execution time of the matrices\nWi U10 (0 \u2264 i \u2264 5) by utilizing the Cartan decomposition\noutlined above and found that the execution time is 1/J\nfor i = 0, 1 and 2 while 1/2J for i = 3, 4 and 5. A time\noptimal control for the warp-driven gate W4 U10 = k2 hk1\nis\n\ncomputer. Table I shows the actual NMR pulse sequences derived from the Cartan decompositions of U10\nand W4 U10 . We call the hydrogen nucleus and the carbon nucleus as qubit 1 and qubit 2, respectively, in Table\nI and the rest of this Letter. In spite of the extra gate\nW4 , the latter requires less pulses and half of the execution time required for the former. The permutation W4\nmaps the binary basis vectors as W4 : |10i 7\u2192 |11i, and\naccordingly the output state of W4 U10 upon acting the\ninitial state |00i is |11i.\nIn our experiments, a 0.6 ml, 200 mM sample of\ncarbon-13 labeled chloroform (Cambridge Isotope) in d-6\nacetone has been employed as a two-qubit molecule and\ndata were taken at room temperature with a JEOL ECA500 NMR spectrometer, whose hydrogen Larmor frequency is approximately 500 MHz. The measured spinspin coupling constant is J = 215.5 Hz and the transverse\nrelaxation time is T2 \u223c 7.5 s for the hydrogen nucleus and\nT2 \u223c 0.30 s for the carbon nucleus. The longitudinal relaxation time is measured to be T1 \u223c 20 s for both nuclei.\nThe initial state |00i is prepared as a pseudopure state\ngenerated by the field gradient method [20].\nFigure 2 shows our experimental result. The spectra\nfor the 13 C nucleus (qubit 2) are shown in the panels. The\nspin states of both nuclei are inferred from these spectra.\nThe position of the peak depends on the state of the qubit\n\n\u221a\n\nk1 = ei(\u03c0/2 2)(\u03c3x \u2212\u03c3z ) \u2297 ei(\u03c0/4)\u03c3x ,\nh = ei(\u03c0/4)\u03c3y \u2297\u03c3y ,\nk2 = I \u2297 e\n\ni\u03c0\u03c3x /4\n\n(13)\n\n.\n\nTherefore the execution time T satisfies \u03c0JT /2 = \u03c0/4,\nyielding T = 1/2J. Since the decomposition (13) contains generators which do not exist in the Hamiltonian,\na trick similar to (11) must be employed. The one-qubit\ngates are realized using rf-pulses in an NMR quantum\n\nFIG. 2: NMR spectra obtained by applying a reading pulse to\nthe 13 C nucleus. The rear row shows the pseudopure initial\nstate |00i while the middle row indicates the state |10i obtained by executing U10 on |00i. Finally the front row shows\nthe spectrum obtained from warp-drive quantum computing\nW4 U10 , where the peak corresponds to |11i.\n\n\f4\n1: peaks at 77.49 ppm (part per million) and 79.20 ppm\nstand for the states |1i and |0i, respectively, of the qubit\n1. The positive (negative) amplitude indicates qubit 2\nbeing in the state |0i (|1i). Thus the peak in the rear row\nshows the initial pseudopure state is |00i while the peak\nin the middle row tells us that the execution of Grover's\nalgorithm U10 generates the state |10i. Finally the front\nrow shows the spectrum obtained after the execution of\nthe warp-driven gate W4 U10 . The peak shows that the\nresulting state is |11i, from which the output of U10 |00i is\neasily deduced as |10i. The spectrum obtained with the\nwarp-driven gate is sharper than that with the original\nU10 gate. The undesirable peak at |00i is also improved\nby the warp-drive. Smaller number of gates and reduced\nexecution time account for these improvements.\nWe have also examined the effect of the warp-drives\nfor Grover's algorithms other than U10 and found that\nthe execution times remain unchanged for W0,1,2 while\nthey are halved for W3,4,5 . It should not be expected,\nhowever, that the latter gates reduce the execution time\nof an arbitrary two-qubit gate: clearly, such a \"universal\nwarp-drive\" which reduces execution time of an arbitrary\nquantum algorithm does not exist. In view of the compactness of the unitary group, however, there exists a finite set of simple unitary transformations, such that the\nexecution time of any quantum algorithm is reduced by\n\nproperly chosen elements of the set. We expect that the\nset of permutation matrices, or certain subset thereof, is\nsuch a \"universal warp-drive set\".\n\n[1] M. A. Nielsen and I. L.

We took advantage of the compactness of the group SU(4) and found the\ntime optimal control parameters utilizing the Cartan decomposition for it. When applied to two-qubit Grover's\nalgorithm in the NMR experiment the execution time is\nfound to be halved along with a reduction in the number\nof the gate pulses from 10 to 4. As a result, application of\nwarp-drive quantum computing sharpens the NMR spectrum and reduces the spurious peak, implying reduction\nin decoherence and gate operation errors. How reductions in the execution time and the number of gate pulses\nscales with the number of qubits remains a challenging\nproblem.\nMN would like to thank partial supports of Grant-inAids for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan,\nGrant No. 13135215 and from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), Grant No. 14540346.
