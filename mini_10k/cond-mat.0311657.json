Its importance arises from the possibility to get analytical results\n(see e.g. [2]), but it is also an object of mathematical\ninterest [3]. Currently, the question is controversially debated, whether spin glasses are 'still complex' after some\ndecades of intensive studies ([4], [5], [6] and references\ntherein). Another problem concerns if the results of the\nSK model are valid also for more realistic short-range spin\nglasses [7]. In this context, the question of the finite-size\nscaling is widely discussed.\nThe problem of finding the exact ground state of most\nof the Ising spin-glass models belongs to the class of NPhard problems, i.e. no algorithm is known which finds the\noptimum in polynomial time [8]. Therefore, in the past,\ninvestigations of the size dependence of the ground states\noften were based on approximations. Very recently, attention has been paid to the problem of fluctuations of\nspin-glass ground-state energies [9], [10].\nIn this letter a numerical investigation of exact ground\nstates up to N = 90 spins is presented, which are obtained with the branch-and-bound algorithm of discrete\nnonlinear optimization [11], [12], see also [13].\nStarting from the Hamiltonian\n1\nH = \u2212\u221a\nN\n\nX\n\nJij Si Sj ,\n\n(1)\n\n1\u2264i<j\u2264N\n\nthe SK model is described using Jij = Gij , where the\nindependent identically distributed random numbers Gij\nare chosen from a Gaussian distribution with zero means\nand variance one. The chosen scaling in (1) secures\nthat the spin-glass ground-state energy is an extensive\nquantity. With Jij = |Gij | a fully connected ferromagnetic system with the ground-state energy per spin\n1/2\neid\nis obtained. Because eid\n0 = (N \u2212 1)/(2\u03c0N )\n0 scales\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: kobe@theory.phy.tu-dresden.de\n\nlike N 1/2 , the ferromagnetic model should be considered\nin the following as a limiting case of the SK model irrespective of its physical meaning.\nAnother limiting case is the fully connected antiferromagnetic (afm) system: Jij = \u2212|Gij |. A further interpolation of the described models can be obtained considering a distribution of Jij according\nP (Jij ) = x\u03b4(Jij + |Gij |) + (1 \u2212 x)\u03b4(Jij \u2212 |Gij |).\n\n(2)\n\nStarting from the SK model (x = 21 ) with (2) the behavior of the system can be investigated, when randomly\nselected ferromagnetic interactions are replaced by antiferromagnetic ones of the same strengths or vice versa.\nThe main feature of the ground state is frustration. It\nis shown in [14], [15], [16] that for Ising spin glasses a\nmisfit parameter \u03bc0 can be introduced as a measure for\nfrustration:\n\u03bc0 =\n\n\u0001\n1\n1 \u2212 e0 /eid\n0 .\n2\n\n(3)\n\nIt takes into account that starting from an 'ideal' unfrustrated system with the ground-state energy E0id each\nunsatisfied bond leads to an increase of the ground-state\nenergy double its strength [17]. Consequently, eid\n0 in (3)\nis identical to the value for the ferromagnet case (x = 0)\nfor all models (2).\nThe misfit parameter (3) describes the fraction of each\nbond of the system, which is on average not satisfied in\nthe ground state. For the antiferromagnetic triangular\nlattice, for example, the value is \u03bc0 = 31 , because one of\nthree bonds of equal strength cannot be satisfied. The\nsame parameter was used by Stein et al. [18] to characterize the ground-state energy of \u00b1J models in dependence on the concentration of antiferromagnetic bonds.\nIn a similar way, a related parameter 'ground-state energy per bond' is used by Vogel et al. [19].\nObviously, the maximum of \u03bc0 is 12 for highly frustrated systems (e.g. for high-dimensional hypercubic and\nfcc fully frustrated \u00b1J systems [20], [21], [16]).

The data points for N = 99 (120,000 samples) and 199\n(64,000 samples) (\u22c6) are estimated from Palassini's results\nobtained by a hybrid genetic algorithm [10].\n\nN \u2192 \u221e, it belongs also to the class of systems with\nmaximum occurring frustration (\u03bc0 = 21 ). (Erroneously,\nthe correct N dependence of eid\n0 was not taken into account in [16], so that the discussion about the misfit of\nthe SK model is wrong in that paper.)\nExact ground-state energy and misfit parameter were\ndetermined by using the branch-and-bound algorithm for\nthe SK model and the fully connected afm model, the\nsizes studied are N = 19 to 90 and 56, respectively. The\nnumbers of samples range from 210,000 (N = 19) to 34\n(N = 90, SK) and to 99 (N = 56, afm). The mean misfit\n(N )\nparameters h\u03bc0 i are plotted in Fig. 1 as a function\nof N \u22121/2 and fitted by (3). For this purpose eid\n0 in (3)\nis expanded in ascending powers of N \u22121/2 . Assuming\nthat the N dependence of the mean ground-state energy\n(N )\n\u2212\u03c9\nper spin follows he0 i = e\u221e\nwith \u03c9 = 23 , the\n0 + bN\n\u221e\nfit results in e0 = \u22120.7637 \u00b1 0.0004, which is close to\n= \u22120.76321 [22]). A fit with\nthe analytical result (eRSB\n0\n. This tendency\neven\ncloser\nto eRSB\n\u03c9 = 0.671 shifts e\u221e\n0\n0\nwas also found in [10]. A determination of the finite(N )\nsize scaling of the standard deviation \u03c3 = (h(e0 )2 i \u2212\n(N )\nhe0 i2 )1/2 is restricted by the small number of samples\nfor larger N .

It is\npointed out in [10] that the true values of \u03c1 is probably\nslightly larger than 43 .\nMuch less is known about the related afm systems,\nwhich are even higher frustrated already for smaller N .\n(N )\nPreliminary results for he0 i vs. N seem to exclude\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nx\nFIG. 2: Misfit parameter \u03bc0 as function of the concentration x of antiferromagnetic bonds for some systems with\nN = 49(+), 56(\u00d7), 81(\u22c6), 90(\u0003), 102(\u25b3). The N \u2192 \u221e behavior is suggested by the straight line (Equ. (4)).\n\nthe validity of the same \u03c9 value as it is proposed for\nthe SK model. Instead, \u03c9 = 2 is chosen leading to\ne\u221e\n0,afm = \u22120.474. The estimation of the N dependence\nof the standard deviation results in \u03c1afm = 0.74 \u00b1 0.03.\nThe misfit parameter depending on the fraction of\nantiferromagnetic bonds x of the model (2) is shown\nin Fig. 2 for some finite systems. For x \u226a 1 the\nground-state energy increases linearly with x according\nto e0 (x) = eid\n0 (1 \u2212 2x), i.e. \u03bc0 (x) = x, as long as the\nground state remains ferromagnetically ordered. Obviously, this behavior persists also with increasing x,\nwhereas \u03bc0 is stabilized for x > 0.5. (A relatively flat\nminimum for the finite systems can be understood keeping in mind that the basic element of the system is the\ntriangle configuration, which has the tendency to reduce\nthe frustration, when it is built of two antiferromagnetic\nand one ferromagnetic bonds. This situation arises relatively often at x = 32 .) Otherwise, it can be recognized\nfrom the results presented in Fig. 1 that \u03bc0 (x \u2265 12 ) = 21\nin the thermodynamic limit N \u2192 \u221e. So the numerical\nresults for system sizes up to N = 102 suggest\n\u001a\nx\n< 0.5\n\u03bc0 (x) =\nfor x\n(4)\n0.5\n\u2265 0.5\nand imply that starting from the SK model (x = 21 ) immediately a ferromagnetic ground state appears, when\nantiferromagnetic interactions partly are replaced by ferromagnetic ones.\nIn summary, exact numerical data for the ground-state\nenergy and its finite-size scaling are presented, which are\nin agreement with recent results of Palassini [10] obtained\nusing hybrid genetic algorithm. They also provide the\nT \u2192 0 limit of the energy equench of inherent structures,\n\n\f3\ni.e. the mean energy of the minima accessible from equilibrium configurations [23], [24]. Moreover, exact results\nare important to control the efficiency of approximated\nalgorithms, which can be applied for larger systems [25].\nThe SK model belongs to the class of maximally frustrated systems, which have a misfit parameter \u03bc0 = 21 . It\nis embedded as a special case into related models, which\nare introduced by varying the signs of the interactions\nJij . The ground state of the SK model switches over\nfrom a spin-glass state to a ferromagnetic one, when the\n\nfraction of the ferromagnetic interactions is larger than\nthe fraction of antiferromagnetic ones. The latter conjecture may also enlighten the controversy on the complexity of the SK model or its vanishing and is challenging\nfor further investigations.\nI benefit from discussions and correspondence with\nA.K.
