Most of the SR research3 was pursued on dynamic systems with a double well potential,\nsubject to both periodic and random forces, while only a few investigations of SR in extended or coupled systems\nhave yet been conducted.4\nThe Ising model with Glauber dynamics5 can be viewed as a set of coupled two-state oscillators, where the coherent\nsignal is provided by an external oscillating magnetic field and thermal fluctuations are the only source of random\nnoise. Each spin is assumed to be in interaction with a heat reservoir of some sort, which causes it to flip between\nthe values \u03c3 = +1 and \u03c3 = \u22121 randomly with time. In the presence of magnetic coupling between the spins, the\ntransition probability for one spin to flip is assumed to depend on the configuration of the neighboring spins. The\ntime evolution of the system is described by a master equation where the transition rates verify the detailed-balance\ncondition. Solving the master equation, the time dependence of the magnetization and of the spin correlation functions\ncan be obtained. For exchange interaction limited to nearest neighbor (nn) spins, the response of the Ising model with\nGlauber dynamics to an oscillating magnetic field was investigated in one (1D),5,6 two (2D),7 and three (3D)8,9 spatial\ndimensions. For the 1D nn Ising ferromagnet, Brey and Prados6 obtained an analytic expression, within the linear\nfield approximation, for the amplitude and the phase of the induced magnetization. The amplitude always presents\na maximum as a function of temperature, with a genuine resonant behavior only for low frequencies. The Glauber\ndynamics of the 1D Ising model with antiferromagnetic next-nearest neighbor (nnn) exchange interaction competing\nwith the nn one was investigated by Yang,10 who employed a decoupling approximation to solve the master equation\nand get an analytical expression for the time-dependent magnetization. He also found, by heuristic arguments, the\ndynamic critical exponent z, defined as 1/\u03c4 \u2248 (1/\u03be)z (where \u03c4 is the longest relaxation time and \u03be is the correlation\nlength of the chain)11 , to be z = 2, the same as that of the unfrustrated 1D nn Ising model.\nIn this paper, we study - at finite temperature T > 0 - the effect of antiferromagnetic (AF) exchange interactions on\nthe single spin-flip Glauber dynamics of two different one-dimensional Ising models. Our interest in kinetic 1D Ising\nmodels with AF interactions is motivated by recently sinthesized cobalt-based12,13 and rare-earth-based14,15 single\nchain magnets, showing slow relaxation of the magnetization at low temperature. The magnetic properties of the\n\n\f2\nformer chain compound, [Co(hfac)2 NITPhOMe], can be described in terms of a 1D Ising model with AF nn exchange\ncoupling.13,16 However, the resulting short range order is ferrimagnetic, owing to the alternation along the chain of two\ndifferent kinds of magnetic centers (a metal ion, Co2+ , and a nitronyl-nitroxide radical, PhOMe), both with S = 1/2\nbut with different gyromagnetic factors. In spite of further complications due to non-collinearity of the spins,16 this\nsystem was shown to be the first experimental realization of a 1D nn Ising model with Glauber dynamics.13 The single\nchain magnets belonging to the latter class of rare-earth-based compounds, of general formula [M(hfac)3 (NiTPhOPh)],\nwhere M=Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, or Yb, and PhOPh is a nitronyl-nitroxide radical, are characterized by strong Isingtype anisotropy and by the simultaneous presence of both nn and nnn exchange interactions between the magnetic\ncenters, with the last ones being antiferromagnetic in nature.14,15\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section II we investigate the Glauber dynamics in a collinear Ising chain,\nwith antiferromagnetic exchange interaction limited to nearest neighbors and different gyromagnetic factors on the\ntwo opposite sublattices, subject to an oscillating magnetic field. The system of master equations describing the\ntime evolution of sublattice magnetizations can easily be solved within a linear field approximation and a long time\nlimit. Resonant behavior of the magnetization as a function of temperature (stochastic resonance) is found, at\nlow frequency, only when spins on opposite sublattices are uncompensated owing to different gyromagnetic factors\n(i.e., in the presence of a ferrimagnetic short range order). In Section III we investigate the 1D axial next-nearest\nneighbor Ising (ANNNI) model, where an antiferromagnetic exchange between next-nearest neighbor spins is assumed\nto compete with a nearest-neighbor exchange interaction of either sign. The long time response of the model to a\nweak, oscillating magnetic field is investigated in the framework of a decoupling approximation (required in order to\nclose the system of master equations) for three-spin correlation functions, which in principle is more accurate than the\none reported in Ref. 10. As a consequence, our approximate calculation of the dynamic critical exponent z suggests\nthat the T = 0 single spin-flip Glauber dynamics of the ANNNI chain is in a different universality class than that of\nthe unfrustrated Ising chain. Finally, the conclusions are drawn in Section IV.\nII.\n\nGLAUBER DYNAMICS IN THE NEAREST-NEIGHBOR FERRIMAGNETIC ISING CHAIN\n\nWe consider a one-dimensional Ising model with a nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic exchange interaction, J < 0,\nin the presence of a time-dependent external field. The Hamiltonian of the system is\nH = \u2212J\n\nN\nX\nj=1\n\nN/2\nz\n\u03c3jz \u03c3j+1\n\n\u2212 \u03bc0 H(t)\n\nX\n\nz\nz\n(gA \u03c32j\u22121\n+ gB \u03c32j\n)\n\n(1)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere \u03bc0 is the Bohr magneton, and H(t) = H0 e\u2212i\u03c9t is an external magnetic field applied along the z direction and\noscillating in time with frequency \u03c9. Spins on opposite sublattices are allowed to take possibly different gyromagnetic\nfactors (gA 6= gB ), while we assume \u03c3jz = \u00b11 \u2200j. Hereafter, the z index will be dropped for ease of notation. In the\nabsence of a magnetic field, if gA 6= gB the ground state is ferrimagnetic, with opposite uncompensated magnetizations\non the two sublattices; if gA = gB the ground state is antiferromagnetic, with compensated sublattice magnetizations.\nWhen the system is endowed with single spin-flip Glauber dynamics,5 its time evolution is described by the master\nequation\ni\nXh\n\u2202\np(\u03c3, t) =\nWj (Rj \u03c3)p(Rj \u03c3, t) \u2212 Wj (\u03c3)p(\u03c3, t)\n\u2202t\nj\n\n(2)\n\nwhere p(\u03c3, t) is the probability for the system to assume the configuration \u03c3 = {\u03c31 , * * * , \u03c3j , * * * , \u03c3N } at time t, Rj \u03c3\nis the configuration obtained from \u03c3 by flipping spin j, and Wj (\u03c3), Wj (Rj \u03c3) are the transition rates between such\nconfigurations.\nFor a 1D Ising model of spins (\u03c3j = \u00b11) with ferromagnetic nn exchange interaction J > 0 and gyromagnetic factor\ng, Brey and Prados6 showed that, for low frequency, a stochastic resonance phenomenon occurs: i.e., the induced\nP\nmagnetization M (t) = g\u03bc0 N\nj=1 h\u03c3j ; ti oscillates at the same frequency as the magnetic field, and the amplitude of\nM (t) presents a sharp maximum as a function of temperature T . The resonance temperature, Tr , is determined by\nthe matching between the frequency, \u03c9, of the external field and the inverse of the statistical time scale, 1/\u03c4 (Tr ),\nassociated to the spontaneous (i.e., in zero field) decay of the magnetization. In zero field, the magnetization of the\n1D nn Ising ferromagnet\nwas found5,6 to relax to its equilibrium value, M = 0, with the asymptotic t \u2192 \u221e behavior\n\u221a\n4J\n\u2212t/\u03c4 (T )\nM (t) \u2248 e\n/ t. The relaxation time \u03c4 was found to be exponentially divergent for T \u2192 0, \u03c4 (T ) \u2248 e kT (where\nk denotes Boltzmann's constant), and to become of the order of the inverse of the transition rate of an isolated spin\nfor T \u2192 \u221e, \u03c4 \u2248 1/\u03b1.5,6\n\n\f3\nFor a 1D Ising model with antiferromagnetic nn exchange interaction (J < 0), the master equation (2) is still the\nstarting point for the study of the chain dynamics. In this case, if gA 6= gB , the transition rates in the presence of a\nfield are assumed to be different for even (A) and odd (B) lattice sites j\nih\ni\nh\ni 1 h\n1\n(0)\n(3)\nWj (\u03c3) = Wj (\u03c3) 1 \u2212 \u03c3j tanh(\u03b2A,B ) = \u03b1 1 \u2212 \u03b3\u03c3j (\u03c3j\u22121 + \u03c3j+1 ) 1 \u2212 \u03c3j tanh(\u03b2A,B )\n2\n2\n(0)\n\nwhere Wj (\u03c3) denote the transition rates in zero field. The transition rate of an isolated spin, 21 \u03b1, is considered as\ntemperature independent and sets the time scale.

(19) it is apparent that, for antiferromagnetic nn exchange (J < 0) and T \u2192 0, the first\nterm on the r.h.s. is associated with a fast relaxation, while the second term with an exponentially slow relaxation.\nThus, a resonant behavior, similar to the one observed in the ferromagnetic nn Ising chain endowed with single spinflip Glauber dynamics,6 is possible only when spins on opposite sublattices are uncompensated owing to different\ngyromagnetic factors (i.e., in the presence of ferrimagnetic short range order). See Fig. 1, where the temperature\ndependence of the amplitude of \u03c7(\u03c9, T ) is reported, for selected values of the frequency, both in the compensated\n(J < 0 and gA = gB ) and uncompensated (J < 0 and gA 6= gB ) case.\nThe resonant behavior shown by the ferrimagnetic chain at low frequency (see Fig. 1c) is a manifestation of the\nstochastic resonance phenomenon:3 i.e., the response of a set of coupled bistable systems to a periodic drive is\n\n\f5\n\nFIG. 1: (color online) Temperature dependence of the amplitude of the complex susceptibility |\u03c7(\u03c9, T )| for an Ising chain\nwith antiferromagnetic nearest neighbor interaction J = \u22121, subject to a weak external magnetic field oscillating at frequency\n\u03c9.

In Figs. (c,d) the thin (color) lines represent the\ncontributions to the amplitude of the two terms on the r.h.s. of Eq. (19), while the thick (black) line is their sum.

In the ferrimagnetic chain, the role of stochastic noise is played by\nthermal fluctuations and the resonance peak occurs when the deterministic time scale of the external magnetic field\nmatches with the statistical time scale associated to the spontaneous decay of the net magnetization Mtot (t). For low\nfrequency \u03c9 \u226a \u03b1 (i.e., low temperature), the resonance condition for the uncompensated case is\n\u03c9 \u22121 \u2248 \u03c42 (Tpeak ),\n\n(20)\n\nwhile for the compensated case only the mode with fast relaxation \u03c41 \u2248 O(\u03b1\u22121 ) contributes, providing a broad peak\nrather than a genuine resonance. For high frequency \u03c9 \u226b \u03b1 (i.e., high temperature) a broad peak is found, both for\nthe uncompensated and the compensated case, since the two relaxation times \u03c41 and \u03c42 become of the order of 1/\u03b1,\nso that the resonance condition cannot be fulfilled.6\nThe frequency dependence of the peak temperature Tpeak is reported in Fig. 2 both for the compensated (antiferromagnetic) and the uncompensated (ferrimagnetic) chain, and compared with the ferromagnetic counterpart.6\nIn the compensated case, the frequency dependence of the peak is very smooth, owing to the smooth temperature\ndependence of the relaxation time \u03c41 , ranging between 1/(2\u03b1) at low T and 1/\u03b1 at high T . In the uncompensated\ncase, a behavior very similar to the ferromagnetic one is observed for low frequency: the reason is that for low \u03c9 the\ndominant contribution to \u03c7(\u03c9) is provided by the second term on the r.h.s. of Eq. (19). At intermediate frequency,\na maximum is observed owing to the coming into play of the first term on the r.h.s. of Eq. (19).

(1) reduces to the well-known ANNNI (axial next-nearest-neighbor Ising)\nmodel.17 Depending on the competition ratio r = \u2212J2 /J1 , this model in zero field is known to admit a ferromagnetic\nground state for r < 1/2, and a (2, 2) antiphase structure (two spins up, two spins down), with zero magnetization,\nfor r > 1/2; for r = 1/2 the ground state is degenerate and disordered.18 At finite temperatures, the model cannot\nsupport long range order; however, a strong short range order is present in the paramagnetic phase. For zero applied\nfield, as far as the thermodynamic properties are concerned,19 the 1D ANNNI model can be mapped into an equivalent\n1D Ising model with only nearest neigbor interaction in an effective field, and analytic results (see Appendix A.2) can\nbe obtained for the partition function and the spin correlation functions.21,22 In the presence of a static magnetic field,\nthe ground state of the generalized ANNNI model, i.e. a chain of alternating spins with different quantum numbers\nand different nnn exchange interactions on the two sublattices, was thoroughly investigated,20 and the thermodynamic\nproperties were exactly calculated (though numerically) by the transfer matrix method.23,24\nHere we aim at investigating the long-time dynamic response of the ANNNI chain, Eq.

The\ntwo different regimes shall be investigated separately since they require different order parameters.\n\n\f8\nA.\n\nWeak nnn antiferromagnetism (competition ratio 0 < r < 12 )\n\nIn the range of the competition ratio r corresponding to the ferromagnetic ground state (0 < r < 12 ), owing to the\ndifferent gyromagnetic factors on odd (gA ) and even (gB ) lattice sites, it is necessary to consider the magnetizations\nover two sublattices, like in Eq. (8), as the order parameter. From the master equation, Eq. (28), one is thus led to\nconsider a system of two coupled equations of motion, which can be written just like Eq.

The relationships between the normal modes Mn (t) and the\nsublattice magnetizations Mn (t) (n = 1, 2) are the same as in Eqs. (13), (14). Also the expressions for the f -coefficients\nare the same, i.e. f1 = g2B (gB + gA ), f2 = g2B (gB \u2212 gA ). As before, the general solution for the normal modes takes\nthe form in Eq. (15), where the relaxation times are \u03c4n = \u03b1\u03bb1 n , with the eigenvalues now given by Eq. (31). Finally,\nin the case of weak nnn antiferromagnetic coupling, the complex susceptibility of the ANNNI chain turns out to be\ni\n\u03bc2 h\n1\n\u03c7(\u03c9, T ) = N 0 1 \u2212 \u03b31 \u03b71 \u2212 \u03b32 \u03b72 + \u03b31 \u03b32 (\u03b71 + \u03b73 )\n2\n#\n\" kT\n\u0010 g \u2212 g \u00112 1\n\u0010 g + g \u00112 1\n1\n1\nB\nA\nB\nA\n.\n+\n\u00d7\n2\n\u03bb1 1 \u2212 i\u03c9\u03c41\n2\n\u03bb2 1 \u2212 i\u03c9\u03c42\n\n(32)\n\nIn the limiting case r = 0, the well-known result for the nn Ising chain5,6 is correctly recovered. In the case\n0 < r < 21 , we show in Fig. 3 that the approximate static susceptibility, calculated from Eq. (32) for zero frequency,\nturns out to be in good agreement with the exact transfer matrix result,21,22 Eq. (A14), only at high temperatures\n(kT >\n\u223c J1 ). In contrast, an unphysical (negative) static susceptibility is obtained at low temperatures, as a consequence\nof the negative values assumed by the eigenvalue \u03bb1 for kT <\n\u223c J1 .\nThe low-temperature failure of Eq. (32) can be attributed to the decoupling (27) of three-spin correlation functions,\nwhich was made in order to close the set of master equations, Eq. (26): in fact, decoupling approximations have the\ndrawback to be uncontrollable, but in principle they are expected to be more accurate the higher the temperature.\nMoreover, at low temperatures one can guess another source of error to lie in the assumption that, for sufficiently long\ntimes, the spin-spin correlation functions take their static equilibrium values: h\u03c3j \u03c3j+n ; ti \u2192 \u03b7n for t \u2192 \u221e. In fact,\nfor competition ratio in the range 0 < r < 1, the 1D ANNNI model with Glauber dynamics is known to be lacking\nin ergodicity at T = 0: the ground state can not be reached by single spin-flip Glauber dynamics, after a sudden\ncooling of the system down to T = 0 starting from high temperature. The difference between the static (r = 1/2)18\nand the dynamic (r = 1)25 ground state phase boundary of the 1D ANNNI model was pointed out by Redner and\nKrapivsky25, who showed that for 0 < r < 1/2 the ferromagnetic ground state can not be reached because of the\nrepulsion between domain walls which forces them to be at least two lattice constants apart, while for 1/2 < r < 1\nthe (2, 2) antiphase ground state can not be reached owing to the persistence of isolated domains of length \u2265 3.25 In\ncontrast, both for r = 0 (1D nn Ising model)5,26 and r > 1 (1D ANNNI model with strong nnn AF coupling)25 the\nground state can asymptotically (t \u2192 \u221e) be reached at T = 0.\nThe low temperature failure of our approximate theory in the case 0 < r < 21 prevented us from calculating the\ntemperature dependence of the amplitude of the complex susceptibility. However, it is worth observing that, since for\nT \u2192 0 the zero-field static susceptibility diverges,21 a resonant behavior might be expected for low frequency provided\nthat the system admits also a diverging relaxation time for low temperature.\n\n\f9\n\nFIG. 3: (color online) Temperature dependence of the static susceptibility \u03c7(\u03c9 = 0, T ) of an ANNNI chain with J1 = 1,\nJ2 = \u22120.35 and gA = gB = 2, corresponding to a value r = 0.35 of the competition ratio (weak nnn antiferromagnetism).

However it is worth noticing that, for the 1D ANNNI model, the T \u2192 0 asymptotic behavior\nof the static two-spin correlation functions is very different depending on the value of r. For 0 < r < 12 both the\ninter- and the intra-sublattice spin-spin correlations are strong (\u03b71 \u2248 \u03b72 \u2248 \u03b73 \u2248 1, see Note 32 later). In contrast, for\nr > 12 the intersublattice correlations are strong (\u03b72 \u2248 \u22121, see Eq. (45) later), whereas the intrasublattice correlations\nare exponentially vanishing (\u03b71 \u2248 \u03b73 \u2248 0, see Eq. (45)). At intermediate temperatures intrasublattice correlations\nbecome significant, too, and the decoupling approximation becomes less satisfactory; at high temperatures, it works\nwell again, since all correlations (both intra- and inter-sublattice) decrease.\nIt should be remarked that the above considerations about the behavior of static correlation functions can not, on\ntheir own, account for the good agreement found, at low T , in the case 21 < r < 1. In fact, the use of equilibrium\nvalues for the spin correlations might be questionable, since the T = 0 Glauber dynamics does not lead to the ground\nstate of the 1D ANNNI model in the entire region 0 < r < 1.25 To this regard, first we observe that the physical\nmechanism which at T = 0 prevents the system from reaching the ground state is different, for 12 < r < 1, with\nrespect to the case 0 < r < 12 .25,27,28 Next, considering that at T = 0 a 1D model is simultaneously in the ordered\nphase and at its critical point, while our theory applies at T > 0, we believe that some insight into the problem might\n\n\f12\n\nFIG. 5: (color online) Temperature dependence of the amplitude of the complex susceptibility |\u03c7(\u03c9, T )| for an ANNNI chain\nwith J1 = 1, J2 = \u22121.25 (r = 1.25), subject to a weak external magnetic field oscillating at frequency \u03c9. Figures (a), (b) refer\nto the compensated case (gA = gB = 2), while Figures (c) and (d) to the uncompensated case (gA = 2, gB = 3), for selected\nvalues of the frequency (\u03c9/\u03b1 = 0.001 and 10). In Figs. (c,d) the thin (color) lines represent the contributions to the amplitude\nof the two terms on the r.h.s. of Eq. (41), while the thick (black) line is their sum. No resonant behavior is observed.\n\nbe provided by a careful study of the role of a small but non-zero temperature on the coarsening of the 1D ANNNI\nmodel.26,29\nIn Fig. 4b the approximate static susceptibility, calculated from Eq. (41) for zero frequency in the case r > 1, is\nreported. A nice overall agreement with the exact transfer matrix result21,22 is obtained. In this case our approximate\nresults are expected to be quite reliable since the long-time approximation is well founded (for r > 1, the static\nequilibrium state can asymptotically be reached even at T = 0,25 and thus the use of static spin-spin correlation\nfunctions is justified); moreover, the decoupling approximation is expected to be satisfactory both at high and low\ntemperatures. Finally it is worth mentioning that, in the limiting case 1/r = 0 (i.e., J1 = 0), the transfer matrix\nresult for the static susceptibility is exactly reproduced by Eq. (41) for \u03c9 = 0 (not shown).\nIn Fig. 5 the temperature dependence of the amplitude of the complex susceptibility |\u03c7(\u03c9, T )|, obtained from\nEq. (41), of an ANNNI chain with nnn antiferromagnetic coupling dominating over the nn ferromagnetic one (competition ratio r = 1.25) is reported - for selected values of the oscillation frequency \u03c9 of the external magnetic field\n- both in the compensated (gA = gB = 2) and uncompensated (gA 6= gB ) case. No resonant behavior was observed\neven in the uncompensated case since, in the T \u2192 0 limit, both the zero-field static susceptibility and the relaxation\ntimes (\u03c43 and \u03c44 in Eq. (41)) fail to diverge. Thus, for low frequency, a resonance condition - similar to the one in\nEq. (20) - can not be fulfilled. In the case 21 < r < 1 a qualitatively similar behavior for |\u03c7(\u03c9, T )| was found (not\nshown).\nC.\n\nCritical dynamics of the 1D ANNNI model for r > 1\n\nThe identification of r = 0, r = 1 and 1/r = 0 as dynamic critical transition points for the 1D ANNNI model\nwith single spin-flip Glauber dynamics was recently proposed in theoretical studies of T = 0 coarsening25 (i.e., the\nrelaxation of the system into the ground state after a quench from high temperature) and T = 0 persistence27 (i.e.,\nthe probability for a spin to remain in its original state after a quench from high temperature). In such T = 0 studies,\n\n\f13\nthe dynamic critical exponent z is customarily defined as the inverse of the growth exponent n of the domain size\n\u2032\n\nL(t) \u2243 tn \u2243 t1/z .\n\n(42)\n\nFor the 1D nn Ising model, analytical calculations26 provided z \u2032 = 2. For the 1D ANNNI model with r > 1 numerical\ncalculations27,30 predicted a somewhat higher dynamic exponent, z \u2032 \u2243 2.3. Finally, it is worth noting that Sen and\nDasgupta,27 in their study of t = 0 persistence in the ANNNI chain, found that the dynamic critical exponent z \u2032\nundergoes abrupt changes for r = 0 (when a slight amount of nnn interaction is added to the nn one), for 1/r = 0\n(when a slight amount of nn interaction is added to the nnn one), as well as for r = 1.27\nThe fair accuracy of our approximate theoretical approach in describing the low temperature static susceptibility\nof the ANNNI chain with r > 1, see Fig. 4b, encouraged us to tentatively estimate the dynamic critical exponent.\nHowever, since we work at finite temperature, rather than at T = 0, we use a different definition, namely11,31\n\u0010 1 \u0011z\n1\n(43)\n= \u03bb1 \u2248\n\u03b1\u03c41\n\u03be\nwhere \u03bb1 is the smallest eigenvalue of the dynamical matrix, see Eq.

Notice that, for the 1D Ising model with\nexchange limited to the nn (r = 0), the value z = 2, obtained using the definition in Eq. (43),31 coincides with the\nvalue z \u2032 = 2, obtained using the definition in Eq. (42).26 This appears not to be the case for the 1D ANNNI model\nwith 1 < r < +\u221e, where the values z = 1 (present work) and z \u2032 \u2243 2.3 (References 27,30) were found. In order to\nascertain the origin of this discrepancy, we believe that it would be useful to study the role of a small but non-zero\ntemperature (T > 0) on the coarsening dynamics of the 1D ANNNI model.29\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn conclusion, in this paper we have studied the effect of antiferromagnetic interactions on the single spin-flip Glauber\ndynamics of two different one-dimensional (1D) Ising models with spin \u00b11. For the first model, an Ising chain with\nantiferromagnetic exchange interaction limited to nearest neighbors and subject to an oscillating magnetic field, the\nsystem of master equations describing the time evolution of sublattice magnetizations can easily be solved within a\nlinear field approximation and a long time limit. Resonant behavior of the magnetization as a function of temperature\n(stochastic resonance) is found, at low frequency, only when spins on opposite sublattices are uncompensated owing\nto different gyromagnetic factors (i.e., in the presence of a ferrimagnetic short range order). For the second model,\n\n\f14\nthe axial next-nearest neighbor Ising (ANNNI) chain, where the nnn antiferromagnetic exchange coupling is assumed\nto compete with the nn ferromagnetic one, the long time response of the model to a weak, oscillating magnetic field\nis investigated in the framework of a decoupling approximation for three-spin correlation functions, which is required\nto close the system of master equations. Within such approximate theoretical scheme, the T = 0 dynamics of the\nIsing-Glauber chain with competing interactions is found to be in a different universality class than that of the Ising\nchain with antiferromagnetic exchange limited to nearest neighbors (r = 0) or limited to next-nearest neighbors\n(1/r = 0). In particular, we find an abrupt change in the T = 0 dynamic behavior of the model in the neighborhood\nof the dynamic critical point 1/r = 0 since, when a slight amount of ferromagnetic nn exchange is added to the\nantiferromagnetic nnn exchange, we find that the critical exponent z, defined by Eq. (43), changes abruptly from\nz = 2 to z = 1. Considering that z = 2 is also the value of the dynamic critical exponent for the unfrustrated nn Ising\nchain, one might expect similar abrupt changes in z to occur also in the neighborhood of the dynamic critical points\nr = 0 (i.e. when a slight amount of AF nnn exchange is added to the nn F exchange) and r = 1, as suggested by\nstudies of T = 0 coarsening dynamics25 and T = 0 persistence27 in the ANNNI chain. Unfortunately, the inaccuracy\nof our approximate theoretical scheme in reproducing the static susceptibility of the 1D ANNNI model with 0 < r \u2264 1\nfor low temperature prevented us from calculating the dynamic critical exponent in this range of the competition\nratio.\nAPPENDIX A: ANALYTIC TRANSFER MATRIX RESULTS FOR THE STATIC PROPERTIES OF 1D\nISING MODELS\n1.\n\nThe 1D nearest neighbor Ising model with alternating spins in a static field\n\nIn this subsection we calculate, within the transfer matrix formalism,33 the static properties of the 1D Ising model,\nEq.
