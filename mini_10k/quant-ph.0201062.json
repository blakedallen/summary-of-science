We find that the atomic collisions can be\ndescribed by an effective decay rate that limits storage and delay times. We calculate the\nmomentum and temperature dependence of the decay rate and find that it is necessary\nto excite atoms at a particular momentum depending on temperature and spacing of the\nenergy levels involved in order to minimize the decoherence effects of atomic collisions.\nPACS numbers: 03.75.Fi, 03.67.-a, 42.50.Gy\n\nElectromagnetically\ninduced\ntransparency\n(EIT) [1] allows a medium that is opaque to be\nmade transparent around its resonant frequency.\nRecent experiments using EIT of cold trapped\natomic gases have shown that one can delay light\npulses by reducing the group velocity to speeds as\nlow as 1 m/s [2,3]. Moreover it is possible to store\nthem for up to 1 ms before regenerating them [4]\n(for a recent review see [5]). There are two main\nfactors that affect the photon delay or storage time\nin EIT experiments [5,6]. Firstly, the delay time is\nlimited by the finite frequency width of this transparency window. We shall assume that the pulse\nduration is sufficiently long that its bandwidth fits\nwithin the transparency window. Secondly, the decay of the dark state arising from atomic collisions,\nas well as from possible couplings to states outside\nthe system, limits the delay and storage times in\nthese experiments. In this paper we discuss how\nthe decay of the dark state is related to the delay\nor storage times. We study the dependence of the\ndecay width introduced by collisional atomic interactions on temperature and on the momentum\ntransferred from the photons to the atoms.\nWe consider a homogeneous gas of atoms whose\ninternal structure may be described as a three-level\nsystem as shown in Figure 1. Homogeneity should\nbe a good approximation for the central region\nof the large alkali-metal condensates achieved in\npresent day experiments. The ground state |B, 0i,\nwhich describes a coherently populated, weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate with a mean\nnumber of N0 atoms, is resonantly coupled to the\nexcited state |Ai by a weak probe pulse. This\nprobe pulse is described by a single-mode quantized electromagnetic field with frequency \u03c9p . Its\ndipolar coupling strength to the atoms is g. For\nconvenience, we take the probe pulse to be initially in a number state |p; ni with n photons. The\nmetastable translational state |C, ki of atoms with\nc.m. momentum k in internal state |Ci is reso-\n\nnantly coupled to |Ai with a classical laser field\nwith frequency \u03c9c characterized by the Rabi frequency \u03a9. We describe the decay of the excited\nstate |Ai due to spontaneous emission with a rate\n\u03b3A .\n|A>\n|p>\n\ng\n\n\u03b3A\n\n\u03a9\n| C, k >\n\n| B, 0 >\n\n\u03b3 C (k)\n\n\u03b5CB\n\nFIG. 1. We consider 3-level atoms illuminated by\na single quantized (probe) mode with coupling g and a\nclassical laser field characterized by the Rabi frequency\n\u03a9. We assume the condensate atoms to be in a coherent state |B, 0i. The lasers transfer the atoms to the\ninternal level C, into the translational state |C, ki with\ndefined momentum k. \u03b3A and \u03b3C (k) characterize the\ndecay rates from |Ai and |C, ki, respectively.\n\nThe population of the state |C, ki decays predominantly due to 2-body elastic collisions with\nthe atoms in internal state |Bi which conserve the\ninternal atomic quantum number. This decay may\nbe described by a rate \u03b3C (k) depending on the momentum of the decaying mode if the modes with\nmomenta different from k as well as the condensate\nof atoms in internal level |Bi are close to thermal\nequilibrium. \u03b3C (k) may be calculated perturbatively using a linear response approach to the mode\noperator time evolution [7].\nThe dynamics of the system we consider is described by the following system of equations of motion for the atomic operators \u00c2, \u0108k and the probe\nphoton operator \u00e2:\np\n \u0307\n\u00c2 = \u2212i\u03a9 \u0108k \u2212 ig N0 \u00e2,\n \u0307\n\u0108k = \u2212i\u03a9 \u00c2 \u2212 (\u03b3C (k)/2) \u0108k \u2212 F\u0302C,k ,\np\n\u00e2 \u0307 = \u2212ig N0 \u00c2 \u2212 (\u03b3A /2) \u00e2 \u2212 F\u0302A .\n\n(1)\n\n\f\u00d7|C, k; mi|p; n \u2212 mi\n\n(2)\n\nwhere |C, k; mi is the number state where m atoms\nare in mode k in level C. If the mixing angle is defined through\n\u221a\ng N0\n,\n(3)\ntan \u03b8 =\n\u03a9\nand provided one neglects \u03b3C (k), the state (2) does\nnot change in time except for an overall phase. By\nadiabatically adjusting \u03a9 and thereby varying \u03b8\nfrom 0 to \u03c0/2, one can transfer the initial photon population into collective atomic excitations\nin |C, ki. The reverse can be achieved by adiabatically changing \u03b8 back to 0. In [9,6] this is described\nin terms of dark-state polaritons. In this idealized process the sum of photons in the probe beam\nstate and atoms in |C, ki, i.e. np (t) + nC,k (t) =\nh\u00e2\u2020 (t)\u00e2(t)i + h\u0108k\u2020 (t)\u0108k (t)i, remains constant and\nthe model describes the stopping and regenerating\nof a light pulse in an atomic medium.\nThis simple picture no longer fully holds once\ndecay is taken into account. We have studied\nthe effects of \u03b3C (k) by numerically calculating\nnp (t) + nC,k (t). To this end we use the Heisenberg equations of motion (1) with respect to an\ninitial dark state (2), assuming the corresponding energies to have small imaginary components\nas given in (1). Note that we have in principle to take into consideration the corresponding\nLangevin noise operators F\u0302C,k , F\u0302A when calculating the time evolution of the number operators.\n\nOne may show, however, that a quantum regression theorem holds for the correlation functions of\ntwo normal ordered operators [7]. Therefore (1)\nmay be used, neglecting the Langevin terms, for\nthe calculation of their time evolution.\nWe see in Figure 2 that np + nC,k decays faster\nthe closer \u03b8 is to \u03c0/2, or equivalently, \u03a9 is to zero.\nThis faster decay arises because more photons are\nconverted into atomic excitations. Apart from this,\nthe decay is dominated by \u03b3C (k) and\u221aas long as this\nis reasonably small (i.e. \u03b3C (k) < g N0 , which is\nwell satisfied in\n\u221a present experiments, e.g. \u03b3C (k) <\n(2\u03c0)10 kHz, g N0 \u2243 (2\u03c0)15 MHz in [4]), the populations np + nC,k , np and nC,k all decay at the\nsame rate.\nt=0\n\n1\n\n\u03b3Ct = 0.1\n\n0.8\n0.6\n\np\n\nC\n\n(n +n )/n\n\nHere we have chosen an interaction picture where\nthe fast evolution due to the energy splitting of the\nstates has been factored out of the operators, and\nthe resonance conditions \u01ebAB \u2212 \u01ebCB \u2212 \u01eb\u0303C\nk = h\u0304\u03c9c ,\n\u01ebAB = h\u0304\u03c9p have been taken into account. Here,\n2 2\n\u01eb\u0303C\nk = h\u0304 k /(2m) is the c.m. kinetic energy of an\natom in mode k and internal state |Ci. F\u0302C,k and\nF\u0302A are the Langevin noise operators corresponding to the decay of the operators \u0108k and \u00e2 respectively which provide for the mode operators\nto obey Bose commutation relations and the correlation functions of these operators to decay to\ntheir equilibrium values [8,7].\nThe recently achieved light propagation slowing\nand storage of light pulses in cold atomic gases\nrely on the possibility to create a dark state. A\ndark state |D(n, \u03b8)i which is consistent with our\nassumption of a probe beam being initially in a\nnumber state and a condensate in a coherent state\n|B, 0i has the form of a \"beam-splitter state\":\ns\nn\nX\nn!\nn\n(\u2212 tan \u03b8)m\n|D(n, \u03b8)i = (cos \u03b8)\nm!(n\n\u2212\nm)!\nm=0\n\n\u03b3Ct = 1.0\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n\u03b3 t = 10\nC\n\u03c0/4\n\u03b8\n\n\u03c0/2\n\nFIG. 2.\nNumber of photons in the weak probe\nbeam plus the number of atomic excitations in |C, ki,\nnp + nC,k , as a function of \u03b8 for different times using experimental parameters [2]: \u03a9 = (2\u03c0)5.61 MHz,\n\u221a\n\u03b3A = (2\u03c0)10 MHz. We also assume \u03b3C (k) < g N0 .\n(N0 \u2243 106 atoms, n \u2243 3 * 104 photons.)\n\nIn the light storage experiments, the system remains at \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 (i.e. \u03a9 = 0) for much longer\nthan it spends in transition. For example, in [4]\nthe delay time plus the time it took to turn on and\noff the coupling laser was on the order of microseconds whereas the maximum storage time was on\nthe order of milliseconds. Since the rate of decay is\nhighest when the photons are stored (\u03b8 = \u03c0/2) and\nthe storage time far exceeds the delay and turnon/off times, we approximate that all of the decay\nof np + nC,k occurs while the photons are stored as\natomic excitations. The maximum storage time \u03c4s\nis then given by \u03c4s <\n\u223c 1/\u03b3C (k).\nFor slow light experiments, the characteristic\ndecay time, \u03c4d , at which np + nC,k has decayed\nto a fraction 1/e of its initial value n, has to\nbe calculated numerically. Assuming that effects\nother than collisions are irrelevant [10], we estimate \u03c4d for coherent slow light propagation in a\nBose-condensed gas at T = 0 from the time evolu-\n\n\ftion of the dark state (2), for the experimental\n\u221a parameters from [2]: \u03a9 = (2\u03c0)5.61 MHz and g N0 \u2243\n(2\u03c0)10 MHz. We find that \u03c4d \u2248 1.2/\u03b3C (k). As can\nbe seen in Figure 2 \u03c4d is in general greater than\n1/\u03b3C (k).\nWe have seen that the decay caused by collisions and characterized by \u03b3C (k) limits the maximum time for the storage of light pulses in an\natomic condensate. We have calculated \u03b3C (k)\nfor the decay of a single excited mode of atoms\nin a different internal state than the condensate\natoms, using stationary perturbation theory in the\ninteractions beyond the quadratic Hartree-FockBogoliubov hamiltonian. The results of this calculation can also be derived using a time-dependent\nlinear response approach [7]. In the following we\nstudy the dependence of \u03b3C (k), and hence of \u03c4d and\n\u03c4s , on momentum k and temperature. We consider\na homogeneous dilute condensate of N0 particles\ndominated by two-body collisions. Their strength\nis determined by the s-wave scattering length a,\nwhich we assume to be the same for collisions either of atoms within level B or between atoms in\nB and C. An extension of our methods to the case\nof trapped condensates is straightforward. We assume the condensate is confined in a box of volume\nV and apply periodic boundary conditions. Collisions between atoms in |Bi change the free particle dispersion relation to the Bogoliubov quasiparticle dispersion relation\nq\n2 + yk2\n(4)\n\u01eb\u0303B\n=\n\u03bc\ny\nk\nk\n\nwhere \u03bc = (h\u0304k0 )2 /2m and yk = k/k0 . The inverse of the healing length, k0 = (8\u03c0n0 a)1/2 , separates the phonon-type from the free-particle type\nregion of the quasi-particle spectrum. To the leading order, only the spin-conserving collisions between atoms in |Bi and |Ci affect the excitations\nin |C, ki, causing a non-zero \u03b3C (k). Collisions involving atoms in |Ai can be ignored because of its\nnegligible population. Finally, collisions between\natoms in internal state |Ci can be neglected as\nthere is no macroscopically occupied c.m. mode.\nWe neglect the energy shift of the levels due to\ninteractions between excitations in |Ci and |Bi,\nwhich arises at the same order as \u03b3C (k) [7].\nThe collisional decay rate can be separated into\nthe Beliaev-like and Landau-like decay rates (hereafter referred to as Beliaev and Landau decay\nB\nL\nrates), i.e. \u03b3C (k) = \u03b3C\n(k) + \u03b3C\n(k). The Beliaev\ndecay rate, corresponding to a particle in |C, ki colliding with a condensate atom in |B, 0i, producing\none quasiparticle in |B, ii and one particle excitation in |C, ji, both of lower energy, zkC = ziC + zjB\nq\n(zjB = yj 2 + yj2 , zkC = yk2 ), is given by\n\na\u03bck0\nB\n\u03b3C\n(k) =\nh\u0304yk\n\nZ\n\nC\nzk\n\n0\n\n\uf8eb\n\n1\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8\ndzjB \uf8ed1 \u2212 q\n1 + (zjB )2\n\nB\n\u00d7 (1 + nC\ni + nj ).\n\n(5)\n\nB\n\u22121\nwith populations nB\nj = (exp[zj \u03bc/kB T ] \u2212 1)\nC\nB\n\u22121\n.\nand nC\ni = (exp[(zk + zCB \u2212 zj )\u03bc/kB T ] \u2212 1)\n(zCB = \u01ebCB /\u03bc). The Landau decay rate is caused\nby the reverse processes where a particle in |C, ki\ncollides with a quasiparticle in |B, ji to produce\na particle excitation in |C, ji with higher energy\nziC = zkC + zjB . It is given by\n\nL\n\u03b3C\n(k) =\n\na\u03bck0\nh\u0304yk\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n1\n\uf8f8\ndzjB \uf8ed1 \u2212 q\n1 + (zjB )2\n\nC\n\u00d7 (nB\nj \u2212 ni ),\n\n(6)\n\nC\nB\n\u22121\nwhere nC\n.\ni = (exp[(zk + zCB + zj )\u03bc/kB T ] \u2212 1)\nWhereas Beliaev processes are restricted to modes\nwhose energies are less than that of decaying particles, Landau processes can involve any mode with\nan appreciable population. This causes the Landau decay to dominate at higher temperatures. At\nT = 0 only the Beliaev rate survives giving\n!\np\nln(yk2 + 1 + yk4 )\n.\n\u03b3C (k)T =0 = a\u03c90 k0 yk 1 \u2212\nyk2\n\n(7)\nAt high momentum where k \u226b k0 , \u03b3C (k)T =0 \u2248\n\u03b3KT (k), where \u03b3KT (k) = n0 \u03c3v is the collision rate\nfrom classical kinetic theory, assuming the particles have speed v = h\u0304k/m and cross sectional area\n\u03c3 = 4\u03c0a2 . At low momentum k \u226a k0 , we obtain\n\u03b3C (k)T =0 \u2248 h\u0304k 5 /96m\u03c0n0. This low-momentum\nlimit of the decay rate has the same k 5 dependence as the T = 0 Beliaev decay rate for quasiparticle excitations in a single state condensate\n[11,12], from which it only differs by a constant\nnumerical factor.\nIn Figure 3 we plot \u03b3C (k) as a function of k/k0\nfor different temperatures using experimental parameters of [2]. As the temperature increases from\nT = 0, Landau processes start to dominate at\nlow k while Beliaev processes remain dominant at\nhigh k, creating a minimum decay rate at a finite\nk. Eventually the minimum disappears because\nat that point Landau processes dominate at all k.\nThe minimum of \u03b3C (k) at a finite k develops because of the separation \u01ebCB of the energy levels\n|B, 0i and |C, 0i. Note that for the condensate in\n[2] with a length of 230 \u03bcm the minimum yk = k/k0\nis of the order of 5 * 10\u22123, such that the description\n\n\fof the loss from |C, ki by a decay rate is expected\nto be justified.\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\nT/T = 0.5\nc\n\n2\n\nC\n\nT/T = 0.1\n\n0\n\n10\n\nc\n\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\nT/T = 0.01\nc\n\n0\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n0\n\nT=0\n\u22124\n\n10\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\u03b3B(k) (s\u22121)\n\n\u22121\n\n\u03b3C(k) [s ]\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n\u03b3L(k) (s\u22121)\n\n10\n\n\u03b3 (k) [s\u22121]\n\n4\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\nk/k\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n0\n\nFIG. 3.\nThe decay rate \u03b3C (k) due to atomic\ncollisions, as a function of normalized momentum\nk/k0 for different temperatures, using the experimental parameters [2]: 23 Na atoms, a = 2.8 nm,\nTc = 435 nK, n0 = 8 * 1013 cm\u22123 , \u03bc/h\u0304 = (2\u03c0) 1.21 kHz\nand \u01ebCB /h\u0304 = (2\u03c0)1.8 GHz.\n\nTo emphasize the importance of \u01ebCB , we plot\nB\nL\n\u03b3C\n(k), \u03b3C\n(k), and \u03b3C (k) as functions of k for different values of \u01ebCB in Figure 4. We see that, as \u01ebCB\nis increased, the Landau rate significantly increases\nC\nat low k because a large \u01ebCB causes (nB\nj \u2212 ni )\nB\nB\nC\nin eqn. (6) to approach nj while (nj \u2212 ni ) approaches zero as k \u2192 0 for \u01ebCB \u2192 0. Furthermore, the Beliaev rate decreases slightly as \u01ebCB\nincreases because nC\ni \u2248 0 in eqn. (5) at large \u01ebCB .\nWe can see that the minimum in \u03b3C develops for\nsufficiently large \u01ebCB at certain temperatures because the Landau rate dominates at low k while the\nBeliaev rate dominates at high k. As the temperature increases, the momentum transfer required to\nminimize \u03b3C (k) also increases. For example, using\nT /Tc = 0.5 and the experimental parameters used\nin Figure 3, we find \u03c4s = 0.5 ms at yk = 0.1 and\n\u03c4s = 4.1 ms at yk = 1.\nWe have shown in this paper that the storage\ntime for light pulses in atomic condensates using\ndark-state based EIT schemes is limited by loss\ncaused by collisions between particles and quasiparticles in the atomic ensemble. We found that\none can minimize this loss in a homogeneous BEC\nby adjusting the momentum k transferred to the\natoms. The optimum k depends on the characteristics of the three-level system and the temperature.\nIn this respect the collisional decay in a system\nwhere the atoms in the excited translational mode\nare in a different internal state than the condensate atoms shows an important property distinct\nfrom the case with only one internal state.\n\n1\n\nk/k0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nk/k0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nk/k0\n\n2\n\n3\n\n3\n\nFIG. 4.\nThe decay rate \u03b3C (k), as a function of\nk/k0 for different values of zCB = \u01ebCB /\u03bc, for the\nsame experimental parameters as used in Figure 3 and\nT /Tc = 0.1.
