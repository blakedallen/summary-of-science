H. SAXON\nFaculty of Physical Sciences,\nUniversity of Glasgow,\nGlasgow, G12 8QQ, Scotland\nE-mail: d.saxon@physics.gla.ac.uk\nRecent results from HERA are presented on a range of topics: charged multiplicities, production of non-strange mesons and strange particles, charm fragmentation,\nbaryons decaying to strange particles, antideuteron production, Bose-Einstein correlations, and new interpretations of results on prompt photon production in DIS.\n\nThis article reports on recent experimental results from H1 and ZEUS,\ntogether with new theoretical ideas in the case of prompt photon production. The topics covered are\n\u2022 Charged Multiplicities in DIS and diffractive DIS (DDIS).

Charged Particle Multiplicities in DIS and DDIS.\nHistorically, charged particle multiplicities have been measured in DIS in\nthe current region of the Breit frame - defined as the frame in which there is\n1\n\n\fSeptember 20, 2018\n\n22:34\n\nProceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\nsaxon\n\n2\n\n<nch>\n\nno energy transfer in the collision. In zeroth order perturbative QCD this\ncorresponds to a quark-parton jet with energy Q/2 and can be compared\nto a half-event in e+ e\u2212 annihilation. Early ZEUS results covered the range\n10 < Q2 < 4000 GeV2 with rather large errors at the high end. The results\nlie mostly on top of e+ e\u2212 annihilation but fall below those at Q2 < 50 GeV2 .\nNew analyses in the Breit frame using 2Ecurrent as the scale instead of Q/2\nfix this problem at low energy - see figure 1.\n\nZEUS\n30\nZEUS (prel.) 96-97 Current Region Breit Frame (x2) (2*Ecurrent)\nZEUS (prel.) 96-97 Photon Region \u03b3*P c.m.s.

Instead we can work in the \u03b3 \u2217 p centreof-mass frame using the hadronic energy W as the scale and access instead\na larger rapidity range of ln(W/m) (Recall W 2 \u2243 Q2 /x.) These results\nare also shown in figure 1 and show excellent agreement between DIS and\n\n\fSeptember 20, 2018\n\n22:34\n\nProceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\nsaxon\n\n3\n\ne+ e\u2212 , and with calculations using Lepto and Ariadne.\nZEUS have also looked at an alternative approach, which is to use only\nthe best part of the tracker (20\u25e6 < \u03b8 < 160\u25e6 ) where the tracking efficiencies\nare high and well-known and to plot the multiplicity (excluding the recoil\n2\nelectron) as a function of Meff\n= (\u03a3E)2 \u2212 (\u03a3p)2 . The results cover the\nrange 5 < Meff < 40 GeV and agree well with Ariadne. There is a weak\nBjorken-x dependence across the range 0.006 < x < 0.1.\nH1 have compared multiplicities in DIS and DDIS. The variable used\nto characterise the DDIS event is the mass of the diffractively produced\nhadronic system, Mx , giving a rapidity range of ln(Mx /m). Many comparison plots are made of mean multiplicity versus W or Q2 for different\nMx ranges. As Mx increases, the DDIS mean multiplicities, and their rapidity spectra, smoothly approach the DIS values from below. This is as\none might expect naively in a colour-string approach where what matters\nis the number of units of rapidity of colour-string available to fragment into\nhadrons.\n2. Non-strange inclusive meson photoproduction\nH1 have analysed the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass spectrum in photoproduction. Mass peaks\nfor \u03c10 , f0 and f2 are identified over a large and steeply falling background.\nThey plot (see figure 2) a universal curve of spin-weighted rate against\npT + m. Within the discrimination of a log-log plot, these mesons and\n\u03b7 and \u03c0 + lie on the same line and follow a power law over six orders of\nmagnitude.\n0\n\n3. K 0 , \u039b0 and \u039b production in DIS.\nZEUS present clean mass peaks for these strange particles and plot the\n0\n0\npT , \u03b7, Q2 and x distributions for Ks0 , \u039b0 + \u039b , and the ratios (\u039b0 + \u039b )/Ks0 ,\n0\n0\nand (\u039b0 \u2212 \u039b )/(\u039b0 + \u039b ) for Q2 > 25 GeV2 . The error bars, (see figure 3,)\nare small and there is mostly very pleasing agreement with the predictions\nof Ariadne. Ariadne tends to overestimate the K 0 production rate, suggesting that a lower value of s/u \u2243 0.22 may be appropriate. No signficant\n0\ndifference is found between \u039b0 and \u039b . The \u039b/K ratio is underestimated\nby Ariadne for x < 0.003, as shown in figure 3.\n0\n\u039b0 and \u039b polarisations are measured using the \u039b \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 p decay as\nanalyser. In the \u039b0 rest frame the decay angular distribution with respect\nto a chosen axis is proportional to (1 + \u03b1P cos\u03b8) with \u03b1 = 0.642.

There is good agreement on the fractions in all cases, though\nthere is a hint that ZEUS find a somewhat lower value for f (c \u2192 D\u2217+ )\nthan e+ e\u2212 annihilation.\n5. Baryons decaying to strange particles.\nThe search for pentaquarks has revived interest in baryons decaying to\nstrange particles. We do not cover pentaquark issues here but look at\nother particles whose production has now been observed, often small but\nsignificant signals on large backgrounds.

ZEUS demand that charged tracks emerge from the primary\nproduction vertex and identify Ks0 via a \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 secondary vertex, selecting pT (Ks0 ) > 0.3 GeV/c and \u22121.5 < \u03b7(Ks0 ) < 1.5 to use the best part\nof the tracker. Additional cuts exclude Dalitz pairs, \u03b3-conversions and \u039b0\ncandidates. Their (Ks0 p) mass resolution is 2.4 MeV.\nThree data samples are used: photoproduction, DIS for Q2 > 1 GeV2 ,\nand DIS for Q2 > 25 GeV2 . The particle multiplicities, and hence the backgrounds are highest in photoproduction and lowest in the high-Q2 sample.\nIn the Ks0 p(p) mass spectrum, as well as a pentaquark candidate, \u0398(1530),\nin DIS a clear \u039bc (2286) is seen in all three samples with a width of typically\n5.3 \u00b1 3.0 MeV (see figure 4.) The most prominent signal is (278 \u00b1 67) events\nin low-Q2 DIS. It is seen equally in Ks0 p and Ks0 p (162 \u00b1 36 and 116 \u00b1 38\nevents) and equally at forward and backward lab rapidity (131 \u00b1 40 and\n145 \u00b1 34 events.) This is consistent with expectations for \u03b3g \u2192 cc production.\nA clear \u039b(1520) signal is seen equally in both K \u2212 p and K + p mass\nspectra in all three data samples: in photoproduction they observe (13526\u00b1\n561) events giving S/B = 0.05 with errors of 0.4 MeV on both mass and\nwidth. Again the production is the same at forward and backward rapidity,\nagain consistent with photon-gluon fusion.\nIn the \u039b\u03c0 \u00b1 spectrum one searches for \u039e, \u03a3\u2217 and pentaquark production.\n\u039e(1320) and \u03a3\u2217 (1385) production are seen but there is no peak in the\n\u0398+ (1530) region. There is a 4.6 \u03c3 peak near 1600 MeV in the Q2 > 1GeV2\nsample, which might be \u03a3(1580) or \u03a3(1620) production.\nVery clean peaks of (1561 \u00b1 46) events in \u039e\u2212 \u2192 \u039b\u03c0 \u2212 and the same\n+\nnumber in \u039e decay are seen after cuts are made to ensure a clean \u039b decay\nvertex. These in turn lead to a clear narrow \u039e0 (1530) signal in the \u039e\u2212 \u03c0 +\n(and antiparticle) mass spectrum.\n\n6. Anti-deuteron production and heavy particle search.\nH1 have used their excellent dE/dx resolution to measure the photoproduction of K, p, d, t and antiparticles for hW (\u03b3p)i = 200 GeV, 0.2 <\npT /M < 0.7, \u22120.4 < ylab < 0.4, using 5.5 pb\u22121 of data. Clear peaks\nare observed for K + , p, d, t, K \u2212 and p with 7% mass resolution, and a clean\ncluster of 45 antideuterons is observed, corresponding to a cross section of\n(2.7 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b1 0.2 nb). There are no candidates for heavier negative particles.\nAntideuteron production is beyond standard fragmentation models.

Bose-Einstein correlations in Ks0 Ks0 and K \u00b1 K \u00b1 .\nZEUS have performed a Bose-Einstein analysis for charged and neutral\nkaons. The correlation function used for two particles is R(p1 , p2 ) =\n\u03c1(p1 , p2 )/\u03c1(p1 )\u03c1(p2 ) . We set Q12 = p1 \u2212 p2 and fit the data to the form\nR(Q12 ) = \u03b1(1 + \u03b4Q12 )(1 + \u03bb exp[\u2212r2 Q212 ])\nwhere the physics interest lies in the source radius, r, and the incoherence\nparameter, (0 < \u03bb < 1). R(Q12 ) is measured in the data by the double\nratio\nR = [P (data)/Pmix (data)]/[P (MC)/Pmix (MC)]\nall evaluated at the same Q12 , where the suffix mix implies that the two\nparticles are taken from different events. The Monte-Carlo has no BoseEinstein correlations.\nLooking at K \u00b1 K \u00b1 in DIS events (Q2 > 2 GeV2 ) ZEUS find r = (0.57 \u00b1\n0.09 + 0.15 \u2212 0.06) fm in good agreement with LEP and with charged pions.\nThe \u03bb value, (0.31 \u00b1 0.06 + 0.09 \u2212 0.06), is less than half that at LEP. The\nreason is unclear, though we note that the fragmentation may be different in\nthe proton region of the c.m. frame and that \u03c6(1020) decay may therefore\nplay a different role.\nIn Ks0 Ks0 ZEUS find a very similar value for r, in contrast with LEP\nresults where there is a hierarchy, r(\u03c0 \u00b1 ) > r(K \u00b1 ) > r(\u039b). (See figure 5.)\nZEUS find \u03bb \u2243 1.2, similar to OPAL but well above values from ALEPH\nand DELPHI who have removed f0 (980) \u2192 Ks0 Ks0 effects. Correction for\nthis may bring the results into agreement.\n8. Prompt photon emission.\nWe are looking here for hard photons emitted from the quark line in photoproduction or DIS. The experimental definition of photoproduction demands that the electron be lost down the beam pipe, so that a photon\n\n\fSeptember 20, 2018\n\n22:34\n\nProceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\nsaxon\n\nZEUS\n\n2.4\n\n0\n\n\u03bb\n\nRmix(Q12)\n\n9\n\n2 < Q < 15000 GeV\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n0\n\nKs Ks\n\n2.2\n\n2\n\n1.8\n\nZEUS (prel.) 96-00\nFit (Goldhaber parametrization)\n\n0\n\nKS KS\n+ -\n\nDIS (2 < Q2 < 15000 GeV2)\nZEUS (prel.) 96 - 00\n\ne e\n\nDELPHI\nALEPH\nOPAL\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\u03bb = 1.16 \u00b1 0.29 (stat.)\n1.6\n\nr = 0.61 \u00b1 0.08 (stat.)\n\n+ 0.28\n- 0.08 (syst.)\n+ 0.07\n- 0.08 (syst.)\n\n1.4\nfm\n\n1.4\n\n1.2\n1\n\n1.2\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\nQ12 (K0sK0s)\n\nFigure 5.\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n(GeV)\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\nr (fm)\n\nBose-Einstein correlations.\n\nobserved in the detector with pT > 5 GeV must be far from it. We demand\nthat the photon be isolated from all other outgoing particles by drawing a\ncone of radius 1 in (\u2206\u03b7, \u2206\u03c6) around it and demanding that the electromagnetic cluster identified with the photon contain at least 90% of the energy\nfound in the isolation cone. In DIS the photon is therefore far from both\nelectron and quark.\n\u03c0 0 and \u03b7 0 decay to photons provide major backgrounds to prompt photon signals. Both ZEUS and H1 have used transverse shower shape to\ndiscriminate these. In the ZEUS barrel calorimeter (\u22120.7 < \u03b7 < 0.9) the\nfine segmentation means that photons predominantly illuminate only 1 zstrip, \u03c0 0 decay mostly two strips amd \u03b7 decay fills one to many strips. A\nphoton signal is extracted statistically from fitting the shape distributions.\nPhotoproduction of prompt photons is rather well described by both\nPYTHIA (shape OK, normalisation a bit low) and by NLO QCD. H1 measurements of ET\u03b3 , \u03b7 \u03b3 and \u03b7 jet for accompanying jets are all described well.\nCorrections to NLO for multiple interactions (as estimated by PYTHIA)\nimprove the fit, but there are no surprises.\nDeep inelastic scattering turns out to be more of a challenge. ZEUS\nhave published measurements of inclusive prompt photon emission and of\nthe (photon+jet) final state, and they compared these to two Monte Carlo\ncalculations (PYTHIA v6.206 and HERWIG v6.1) and to NLO (that is\nO(\u03b13 \u03b1s ) calculations by Kramer and Spiesberger.

PYTHIA and HERWIG get the normalisation wrong, by factors\n(in the inclusive case) of 2.4 and 8.3 respectively, and HERWIG gets too\nlow a mean Q2 , while PYTHIA gets the slope of the rapidity spectrum\nwrong. A similar story holds in the case of prompt photon plus one jet.\n\n12\n\n2.0\ntheory: MRSTQED04\ndata: ZEUS (hep-ex/0402019)\n\n10\n1.5\n-1\n\n(pb GeV )\n\n6\n\n1.0\n\n\u03b3\n\nd\u03c3/dET\n\nd\u03c3/d\u03b7\n\n\u03b3\n\n(pb)\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0.5\n\n2\n\ntheory: MRSTQED04\ndata: ZEUS (hep-ex/0402019)\n0.0\n\n0\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\u03b3\n\n\u03b7\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\u03b3\n\nET\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n(GeV)\n\nFigure 6. Inclusive prompt photon production in DIS compared to MRST predictions\n(absolute normalisation).\n\nComparisons with NLO calculations, only available for the photon plus\njet case, are more encouraging. The normalisation and mean Q2 are good,\n(within 1.7 S.D. for cross-section) as are the photon rapidity and ETjet distribution. But the jet rapidity is predicted to be more forward peaked\nthan the data and the photon ET spectrum is more steeply falling than the\ndata. More statistics will obviously help to clarify whether these issues are\nsignificant or not.\nAfter these results were published, Martin, Roberts, Stirling and Thorne\nproduced a different approach, in which the outgoing hard photon is emitted\nby the electron, which in turn scatters off a photon which is a constituent\nof the proton, produced by QED/QCD evolution of the proton structure\nfunction. The high Q2 in the event (averaging 85 GeV2 ) in the data is\ncarried by the exchanged electron. MRST calculate the photon structure\nof the proton x\u03b3p (x, Q2 ) to be about 0.03 at x \u2243 0.005, (i.e. about 300 times\nlower that the gluon content. This in turn gives a cross-section prediction\nsimilar to the data (well within 1 S.D.) The predictions for inclusive photon\nproduction, (they do not calculate photon+jet,) are overlaid on the data in\n\n\fSeptember 20, 2018\n\n22:34\n\nProceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\nsaxon\n\n11\n\nfigure 6.\nThe upshot is in some sense intriguing. Both the NLO and the structure\napproach are presumably valid and naively should be added together. Yet\nboth explain to some extent the whole signal, in one case for inclusive\nphotons and in the other in the sub-domain of photon plus jet. It is not\nclear how to reconcile these, and we await further developments\nReferences\nMost\nof\nthe\nwork\ndescribed\nhere\ncan\nbe\nfound at http : //www \u2212 zeus.desy.de/physics/phch/conf/lp05 eps05/ and\nThe\nhttp : //www \u2212 h1.desy.de/h1/www/general/home/intra home.html.\nprompt photon results are found at H1 collab., Eur.Phys.J C38 (2005)\n437-445, ZEUS collab., Phys Lett B595 (2004) 86-100 and A D Martin et\nal., Eur.Phys.J C39 (2005) 155-161.\n\n\f"}
