Let G be a graph of order n and rank(G) be the\nrank of the adjacency matrix of G. In this paper we characterize all graphs with\nE(G) = rank(G). Among other results we show that apart from a few families of\ngraphs, E(G) \u2265 2 max(\u03c7(G), n \u2212 \u03c7(G)), where n is the number of vertices of G, G\n\nand \u03c7(G) are the complement and the chromatic number of G, respectively. Moreover\nsome new lower bounds for E(G) in terms of rank(G) are given.\n\nIntroduction\nLet G be a graph. Throughout this paper the order of G is the number of vertices\nof G. All the graphs that we consider in the paper are finite, undirected and simple. If\n{v1 , . . . , vn } is the set of vertices of G, then the adjacency matrix of G, A = [aij ], is an\n\nn \u00d7 n matrix, where aij = 1 if vi and vj are adjacent and aij = 0 otherwise. Thus A is\n\na symmetric matrix with zeros on the diagonal, and all eigenvalues of A are real. For a\ngraph G, let rank(G) denote the rank of the adjacency matrix of G. The spectrum of graph\n\nG, Spec(G), is the set of the eigenvalues of A, denoted by \u03bb1 (G) \u2265 \u03bb2 (G) \u2265 * * * \u2265 \u03bbn (G).\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nKey Words: Energy, rank, chromatic number.\nAMS (2000) Subject classification: 05C15, 05C50, 15A03.\n\n1\n\n\fWe denote the path and the complete graph of order n by Pn and Kn , respectively. The\ncomplete t-partite graph is a graph whose vertices can be partitioned into t parts so that\ntwo vertices are adjacent if and only if they belong to different subsets of the partition. We\ndenote the complete t-partite graph with parts of sizes r1 , . . . , rt by Kr1 ,...,rt . A matching\nof G is a set of mutually non-incident edges. A perfect matching of G is a matching which\ncovers all vertices of G. For a graph G, the chromatic number of G, \u03c7(G), is the minimum\nnumber of colors needed to color the vertices of G such that no two adjacent vertices have\nthe same color.\nThe H\u00fcckel molecular orbital, HMO theory, is nowadays one of the most important\nfields of theoretical chemistry where graph eigenvalues occur. HMO theory deals with\nunsaturated conjugated molecules. The vertices of the graph associated with a given\nmolecule are in one to one correspondence with the carbon atoms of the hydrocarbon\nsystem. H\u00fcckel theory in quantum chemistry insures that the total \u03c0-electron energy of a\nconjugated hydrocarbon is simply the energy of the corresponding molecular graph\nThe energy of a graph G is defined as the sum of the absolute values of all eigenvalues\nand denoted by E(G). If \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbs are all the positive eigenvalues of a graph G, then we\nhave E(G) = 2(\u03bb1 + * * * + \u03bbs ) = \u22122(\u03bbs+1 + * * * + \u03bbn ). Recently much work on graph energy\n\nappeared in [10, 12, 13, 15, 16].\n\nMain Results\nFirst we state the following lemma without proof.\nLemma 1. [5, p. 21] If for every eigenvalue \u03bb of a graph G, \u03bb \u2265 \u22121, then G is a union\n\nof complete graphs.\n\nIn [6], it is shown that for any graph G, E(G) \u2265 rank(G). Here we characterize all\n\ngraphs G for which E(G) = rank(G).\n\n2\n\n\fLemma 2. Let G be a graph of order n. Then E(G) \u2265 rank(G) and equality holds if and\n\nonly if G = 2r K2 \u222a (n \u2212 r)K1 for some even positive integer r.\n\nProof. Assume that \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbr are all non-zero eigenvalues of G. Let \u03bbn\u2212r (\u03bbr + a1 \u03bbr\u22121 +\n* * * + ar ) be the characteristic polynomial of G, where ar is a nonzero integer. Then the\n\narithmetic-geometric inequality implies that\np\n|\u03bb1 | + * * * + |\u03bbr | p\n\u2265 r |\u03bb1 | * * * |\u03bbr | = r |ar | \u2265 1.\nr\n\n(1)\n\nThus E(G) \u2265 rank(G). If G = 2r K2 \u222a (n \u2212 r)K1 , obviously E(G) = rank(G). Con-\n\nversely, suppose that E(G) = rank(G). So equality holds in (1), that is |\u03bb1 | = * * * = |\u03bbr | =\n\n1. Now, by Lemma 1, G = 2r K2 \u222a (n \u2212 r)K1 .\n\n\u0003\n\nIn [2], it is shown that the energy of a connected graph with at least two vertices is\ngreater than 1. In the following we improve this lower bound.\nTheorem 1. For any connected graph G apart from K1 and K1,i , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 3, E(G) \u2265 4.\nProof. We may assume that G has at least four vertices. Clearly, rank(G) \u2265 2. If\n\nrank(G) = 2, it is shown in [1] that G is a complete bipartite graph. So G is Kr,s , rs \u2265 4,\n\u221a\nand E(G) \u2265 2 rs \u2265 4. If rank(G) = 3, then G has three non-zero eigenvalues. Also\nG has exactly one positive eigenvalue otherwise the sum of the eigenvalues of G is not\n\nzero because \u03bb1 (G) has the greatest absolute value. Hence by Theorem 6.7 of [5, p. 163],\nG is a complete multipartite graph. Since the rank of a complete t-partite graph is t,\nG is a complete 3-partite graph. Therefore G has K3 as an induced subgraph. Thus by\nInterlacing Theorem (Theorem 0.10 of [5]) E(G) \u2265 E(K3 ) = 4. If rank(G) \u2265 4, then by\n\nLemma 2, E(G) \u2265 4.\n\n\u0003\n\nTheorem 2. If G is a connected bipartite graph of rank r, then E(G) \u2265\n\np\n\n(r + 1)2 \u2212 5.\n\nProof. Let \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbs be the positive eigenvalues of G, where s = r/2. Then\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n!2\ns\ns\nX\nX\nX\n\u03bbi\n= 4\uf8ed\n\u03bbi 2 +\nE 2 (G) = 2\n\u03bbi \u03bbj \uf8f8 = 4 (m + s(s \u2212 1)a) ,\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\ni6=j\n\n3\n\n\fwhere m is the number of edges in G and a is the arithmetic mean of {\u03bbi \u03bbj }i6=j . The\ngeometric mean of {\u03bbi \u03bbj }i6=j is\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\nY\ni6=j\n\n\uf8f6(s(s\u22121))\u22121\n\n\u03bbi \u03bbj \uf8f8\n\n= k1/s ,\n\nwhere k = \u03bb1 2 * * * \u03bbs 2 . Since G is connected, m \u2265 r \u2212 1. Note that k \u2265 1. So we have\nq\n\u221a\np\nr\nE(G) \u2265 4m + r(r \u2212 2) k2 \u2265 (r + 1)2 \u2212 5.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe proof of the following lemma is easy and we leave it to the reader.\nLemma 3. If T is a tree with no perfect matching and isolated vertex, then T has at least\ntwo maximum matchings.\nThe following lemma is an immediate consequence of Harary's Theorem, see [3, p. 44].\nLemma 4. The number of maximum matchings of a tree is equal to the product of its\nnon-zero eigenvalues.\nCorollary 1. If T is a tree with no perfect matching, then the product of its non-zero\neigenvalues is at least 2.\nTheorem 3. Let G be a bipartite graph with at least 4 vertices. If G is not full rank, then\nE(G) \u2265 1 + rank(G).\nProof. Without loss of generality, we may\nqassume that G\u221ais a connected graph. From\nr\nthe proof of Theorem 2, we have E(G) \u2265 4m + r(r \u2212 2) k2 , where r = rank(G) and\n\nk = \u03bb21 * * * \u03bb2s and \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbs are positive eigenvalues of G, s = r/2. If G is a tree, then\n4\n\n\fby Theorem 8.1qof [5], G has no perfect matching. Thus Corollary 1 implies that k \u2265 2.\n\u221a\nHence E(G) \u2265 4(n \u2212 1) + r(r \u2212 2) r 4. Note that G is not full rank. So we have E(G) \u2265\nq\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1\n4r + r(r \u2212 2) r 4. Note that if r \u2265 3, then r 4 > exp(1/r) > 1 + 1r \u2265 1 + r(r\u22122)\n. Thus\np\nif r \u2265 3, E(G) > 4r + r(r \u2212 2) + 1 = r + 1. If r = 2, then by Theorem 1 we are done.\nIf G is not a tree, then since G is not full rank, we find, m \u2265 n \u2265 r + 1 and the proof is\n\ncomplete.\n\n\u0003\n\nNow, we would like to obtain some lower bounds for E(G) in terms of the chromatic\nnumber of G and the chromatic number of G.\nTheorem A. (Theorem 2.30 of [7]) For any graph G, n \u2212 \u03c7(G) \u2264 \u03bb1 + * * * + \u03bb\u03c7(G) .\nBy Theorem A, we have the following result.\nTheorem 4. For every graph G, E(G) \u2265 2(n \u2212 \u03c7(G)).\nRemark 1. A well-known theorem of Nordhaus and Gaddum [11] states that for every\ngraph G of order n, \u03c7(G) + \u03c7(G) \u2264 n + 1. The graphs attaining equality in the NordhausGaddum Theorem were characterized by Finck [8], who proved that there are exactly two\ntypes of such graphs, the types (a) and (b) defined as follows.\n(i) A graph G is of type (a) if it has a vertex v such that V \\ {v} can be partitioned\n\ninto subsets K and S with the properties that K \u222a {v} induces a clique of G and S \u222a {v}\n\ninduces an independent set of G (adjacency between K and S is arbitrary). Note that if\n\nG is of type (a), then so does its complementary graph G.\n(ii) A graph G is of type (b) if it has a subset C of five vertices such that V \\ C can be\npartitioned into subsets K and S with the properties that K induces a clique, S induces\n\nan independent set, C induces a 5-cycle, and every vertex of C is adjacent to every vertex\nof K and to no vertex of S(adjacency between K and S is arbitrary). Note that if G is of\ntype (b), then so does its complementary graph.\n\n5\n\n\fIf we omit a perfect matching from the complete graph K2n , the resulting graph is called\ncocktail party and denoted by CP (n). For any graph G with vertices {v1 , . . . , vn }, and any\n\nnon-negative integers a1 , . . . , an , we construct the generalized line graph L(G; a1 , . . . , an )\n\nas follows:\nThe vertex set is the union of the vertex sets of L(G), CP (a1 ), . . . , CP (an ), and the\nedge set is the union of the edge sets, together with edges joining all vertices of CP (ai ) to\nevery vertex of L(G) corresponding to an edge of G containing vi , for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n.\nDenote by An,t for 1 \u2264 t \u2264 n \u2212 1 the graph obtained by joining a new vertex to t\n\nvertices of the complete graph Kn . If we add two pendant vertices to a common vertex\n\nof Kn , then the resulting graph has order n + 2 and we denote it by Bn . For the proof of\nthe next theorem we need the following interesting result due to Wilf, see [3, p. 55].\nLemma 5. For any graph G, \u03c7(G) \u2264 \u03bb1 (G) + 1, where \u03bb1 (G) denotes the largest eigen-\n\nvalue of G.\n\nTheorem 5. Let G be a graph. Then E(G) < 2\u03c7(G) if and only if G is a union of some\nisolated vertices and one of the following graphs:\n(i) the complete graph Kn ;\n(ii) the graph Bn ;\n(iii) the graph An,t for n \u2264 7, except when (n, t) = (7, 4), and for n \u2265 8 with t \u2208\n{1, 2, n \u2212 1};\n\n(iv) a triangle with two pendant vertices adjacent to different vertices (see the graph H5\nin Figure 2).\nProof. First we show that the graphs stated in the theorem satisfy E(G) < 2\u03c7(G). The\nassertion is clear for complete graphs. The characteristic polynomial of Bn (see [5, p.\n159]) is\n\u03bb(\u03bb + 1)n\u22122 [(\u03bb2 \u2212 2)(\u03bb \u2212 n + 2) + \u03bb(\u03bb \u2212 n + 1)(\u03bb + 1) + \u03bb2 (\u03bb \u2212 n + 2)].\nTherefore Bn has at least n \u2212 2 eigenvalues \u22121. By Lemma 1 we find \u03bbn+2 < \u22121,\n\nso by Theorem 6.7 of [5], Bn has exactly two positive eigenvalues. This implies that\n6\n\n\fE(Bn ) = \u22122(\u03bbn+2 \u2212 n + 2) since the sum of eigenvalues of any graph is zero. On the other\n\nhand the characteristic polynomial of Bn is \u03bb(\u03bb+1)n\u22122 f (\u03bb), where f (\u03bb) = \u03bb3 +(2\u2212n)\u03bb2 \u2212\n(1 + n)\u03bb + 2n \u2212 4. It is not hard to see that f (\u03bb) < f (\u22122) = \u22122 for any \u03bb < \u22122. Therefore\nall eigenvalues of Bn are more than \u22122. Thus E(Bn ) = \u22122(\u03bbn+2 \u2212 n + 2) < 2n = 2\u03c7(Bn ).\nA calculation shows that for n \u2264 7, E(An,t ) < 2n = 2\u03c7(An,t ) except E(A7,4 ) = 14.\n\nSo we may assume that n \u2265 8. The graph Kn has n \u2212 1 eigenvalues \u22121, therefore by\nInterlacing Theorem, the graph An,t has at least n \u2212 2 eigenvalues \u22121. On the other\nhand the graphs An,1 and An,2 are not complete multipartite graphs, so they have at least\n\ntwo positive eigenvalues. Then again Interlacing Theorem implies that these two graphs\nhave exactly two positive eigenvalues. The graphs An,1 and An,2 are line graphs, and\nAn,n\u22121 = L(K1,n\u22121 ; 1, 0, . . . , 0), where the vertex v1 in K1,n is the vertex with maximum\ndegree. Hence their eigenvalues are at least \u22122 and Theorem 1.6 of [4] shows that \u03bbn+1 >\n\n\u22122. Thus E(An,t ) = \u22122(\u03bbn+1 \u2212 n + 2) < 2n for t = 1, 2. The graph An,n\u22121 has a zero\neigenvalue, and in the same way we find that E(An,n\u22121 ) < 2n. Now, let 2 < t < n \u2212 1. We\n\nclaim that the graph An,t cannot be a generalized line graph. For any l \u2265 2, CP (l) has\n\nC4 as an induced subgraph and if An,t is a generalized line graph, then we conclude that\nAn,t = L(K1,n\u22121 ; 1). Clearly, An,t is not isomorphic to L(K1,n\u22121 ; 1). Thus by Exercise 14\nof [9, p. 278], \u03bbn+1 \u2264 \u22122. Hence E(An,t ) \u2265 2n. Finally for the graph H5 (see Figure 2)\nby an easy computation we see E(H5 ) < 2\u03c7(H5 ) (see [14]).\n\nNow, we show that apart from exceptional cases of the theorem, for any graph G,\nE(G) \u2265 2\u03c7(G). If G has two non-trivial components, then G has 2K2 as an induced\nsubgraph. Hence Interlacing Theorem (Theorem 0.10 of [5]) and Lemma 5 imply that\n\nE(G) \u2265 2(\u03bb1 + \u03bb2 ) \u2265 2(\u03bb1 + 1) \u2265 2\u03c7(G). Since isolated vertices do not contribute to the\n\nenergy and the chromatic number, we may assume that G is connected. By Remark 1, we\nhave \u03c7(G) + \u03c7(G) \u2264 n + 1. If \u03c7(G) + \u03c7(G) \u2264 n, then we are done by Theorem 4. So we let\n\n\u03c7(G) + \u03c7(G) = n + 1. In this case G is either of type (a) or of type (b). If G is of type (b),\n\nthen G has C5 as an induced subgraph. Therefore \u03bb2 (G) + \u03bb3 (G) \u2265 \u03bb2 (C5 ) + \u03bb3 (C5 ) > 1.\n\nNote that \u03bb3 (C5 ) > 0. Thus by Lemma 5 we have\n\nE(G) \u2265 2(\u03bb1 + \u03bb2 + \u03bb3 ) > 2(1 + \u03bb1 ) \u2265 2\u03c7(G).\n7\n\n\fThus one may assume that G is of type (a). For simplification let |K| = t, where K\n\nis a complete subgraph of G defined in Remark 1. It is easily seen that \u03c7(G) = t + 1.\nClearly, Kt+1 is an induced subgraph of G. We know that Kt+1 has one eigenvalue t and\nt eigenvalues \u22121. So by Interlacing Theorem, G has at least t eigenvalues which are at\n\nmost \u22121. If G has an induced subgraph with at least one eigenvalue \u03bb such that \u03bb \u2264 \u22122,\n\nthen the sum of all negative eigenvalues of G is less than \u2212(t \u2212 1) \u2212 2 = \u2212t \u2212 1. Thus\n\nE(G) \u2265 2t + 2 = 2\u03c7(G).\n\nTherefore we may assume that every eigenvalue of each induced subgraph of G is more\nthan \u22122. This implies that G has no K1,4 as an induced subgraph. Hence every vertex of\n\nK is adjacent to at most two vertices of S.\n\nFirst suppose that there is a vertex a \u2208 K which is adjacent to two vertices {x, y} \u2286 S.\n\nIf |S| \u2265 3, then there exists a vertex z \u2208 S\\{x, y} such that z is adjacent to a vertex b \u2208 K\n\nand b 6= a, v, where v is the vertex given in Remark 1. Thus G has either H1 , or H2 as an\n\ninduced subgraph (see Figure 1).\n\n\u2709\n\u2711\u2711\n\u2711\n\u2711\n\u2709\n\u2711 \u2709\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2709\n\u2745\u2709\n\n\u2709\n\u2711\u2711\n\u2711\n\u2711\n\u2711 \u2709\n\u2709\n\u25d7 \u2745\n\u25d7\n\u25d7\u2745\n\u25d7\u2745\n\u25d7\u2709\n\u2709\n\n\u2709\n\n\u2709\n\nFigure 1: The graphs H1 and H2\nWe have (see [14]) \u03bb6 (H1 ) < \u22121.8, \u03bb5 (H1 ) < \u22121.3, and \u03bb6 (H2 ) < \u22121.7, \u03bb5 (H2 ) < \u22121.6.\n\nSince G has at least t eigenvalues which are at most \u22121, the sum of all negative eigenvalues\n\nof G is less than \u2212(t \u2212 2) \u2212 3 = \u2212t \u2212 1. Thus E(G) \u2265 2t + 2 = 2\u03c7(G). If |S| = 2, there\n\nexist two cases: (1) G = Bn\u22122 ; (2) G has either K1,1,3 or H as an induced subgraph,\nwhere H is the graph obtained by removing one of the pendant vertices of H2 . If (1) is\nthe case, then E(G) < 2\u03c7(G). If (2) is the case, since \u03bb5 (K1,1,3 ) = \u22122, \u03bb5 (H) < \u22121.74,\n\nand \u03bb4 (H) < \u22121.27, as before we conclude that E(G) \u2265 2\u03c7(G).\n\nNow, suppose that every vertex in K is adjacent to at most one vertex of S. If |S| \u2265 2\n8\n\n\fand |K| \u2265 3, then G has an induced subgraph isomorphic to H3 or H4 .\nt\n\nt\n\nt\n\u275a\n\nt\u2714\n\n\u275a\n\n\u2714\n\u275a\u2714\n\u2714\u275a\n\u2714 \u275a\n\n\u2714\u2714\n\nt\nt\u2714\n\n\u275a\u275at\n\nt\n\u2714\u275a\n\u2714 \u275a\n\u2714\nt\u2714\n\n\u275a\u2714\n\u2714\u275a\n\n\u2714\n\u275a\n\nt\n\u2714\u2714\u275a\n\n\u275a\u275at\u2714\n\n\u275a\n\u2714\n\nt\n\nt\n\nt\n\nt\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745t\n\n\u275at\n\u2714\n\nFigure 2: The graphs H3 , H4 , and H5\nThe graph H3 has two eigenvalues one of which is less than \u22121.39 and the other one\n\nis less than \u22121.61. Also H4 has two eigenvalues one of which is less than \u22121.3 and the\n\nother one is less than \u22121.7, see [14]. Thus E(G) \u2265 2\u03c7(G). It remains to consider the case\n\n|S| \u2264 1 or |K| \u2264 2. If |S| = 0, then G = Kn . If |S| = 1, then G = An,t for some t. If\n\n|K| \u2264 2, then |S| \u2264 2. It can be easily checked that G is one of the graphs B1 = K1,2 ,\n\nA3,1 , A3,2 , H5 or Ki , i = 1, 2, 3.\n\n\u0003\n\nLet G be a connected graph of order n. The following corollary shows that either the\ngraph G, or G has energy at least n. Compare with Corollary 5.2 of [10] which states that\nif G has no zero eigenvalue, then E(G) \u2265 n.\nCorollary 2. Let G be a graph of order n \u2265 3. If G or G is neither a complete graph nor\none of the graphs Ak,k\u22121 , B1 , B2 , and A3,1 , then E(G) + E(G) \u2265 2n.\n\nProof. If G is not one of the graphs described in Theorem 5, then E(G) \u2265 2\u03c7(G) and\nthe corollary follows from Theorem 4. If G = H5 , then E(G) + E(G) > 10. If G is a\n\ncomplete graph, B1 , B2 , or A3,1 , it is easily seen that E(G) + E(G) < 2n. If G = Ak,k\u22121 ,\nthen G = K2 \u222a (k \u2212 1)K1 . Hence E(Ak,k\u22121 ) + E(Ak,k\u22121 ) < 2k + 2 = 2n. To complete\n\nthe proof, it is enough to show that the theorem holds for Bk , k \u2265 3 and Ak,t for k \u2265 4,\n\nand t = 1, 2. The graph Bk has k \u2212 2 eigenvalues \u22121, and \u03bbn (Bk ) \u2264 \u03bb6 (B4 ) < \u22121.8. So\n\nE(Bk ) > 2(k \u2212 0.2). On the other hand K1,1,2 is an induced subgraph of Bk . Therefore\n\nE(Bk ) \u2265 E(K1,1,2 ) > 5 and so E(Bk ) + E(Bk ) \u2265 2(k + 2).\n9\n\n\fThe graph Ak,t has k \u22121 eigenvalues \u22121 and \u03bbn (Ak,1 ) \u2264 \u03bb5 (A4,1 ) < \u22121.5, so E(Ak,1 ) >\n\n2k \u2212 1. Also \u03bbn (Ak,2 ) \u2264 \u03bb5 (A4,2 ) < \u22121.68, hence E(Ak,2 ) > 2k \u2212 0.64. Now, the facts\n\nE(Ak,1 ) \u2265 E(K1,3 ) > 3.4 and E(Ak,2 ) \u2265 E(K1,2 ) > 2.8 complete the proof.\n\n\u0003\n\nAcknowledgements.
