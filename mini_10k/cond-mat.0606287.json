We determine the range of hopping parameters where the system exhibits the two-channel Kondo effect\nand has non-Fermi-liquid properties in a wide temperature interval. As this interval is entered from above,\nthe conductance through the side dots increases to a half of the conductance quantum, while the conductance\nthrough the system remains small.

Measuring the differential conductance\nin a three terminal configuration provides an experimental probe into the NFL behavior.\nPACS numbers: 75.30.Hx, 71.10.Hf, 72.10.Fk, 72.15.Qm\n\nQuantum impurity models describe interaction between a\npoint-like impurity with internal degrees of freedom and a\ncontinuum. The Kondo model of a magnetic impurity accounts for the screening of the impurity spin with decreasing\ntemperature (the Kondo effect). Generalized Kondo models,\nsuch as the two-channel Kondo (2CK) model and the twoimpurity Kondo (2IK) model, display NFL physics and quantum criticality, which are the central paradigms used to interpret the unusual behavior found in some systems at low\ntemperatures. The 2CK model may explain unusual logarithmic temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility\nand linear vanishing of the quasiparticle decay rate in some\nCe and U compounds at low temperatures [1]. The 2IK model\nwas applied to study the competition between magnetic ordering and Kondo screening, which determines the ground state\nof the heavy-fermion compounds [2, 3].\nQuantum dots provide tunable mesoscopic realizations of\nquantum impurity models [4, 5], where the relevant model\nis usually the ordinary single-channel Kondo or Anderson\nmodel [6]. The magnetic moment is either fully screened for\na spin 1/2 impurity with Fermi-liquid (FL) ground state or\nunderscreened for a S > 1/2 impurity with a singular FL\nground state [7, 8]. Recently, several experimental realizations of the 2CK model using quantum dots have been proposed [9, 10, 11, 12]. In the system of three quantum dots \u2013\na small dot embedded between two larger dots \u2013 the channel\nasymmetry can be tuned to small values and NFL behavior\nwas predicted in a limited temperature range [13].\nWe consider two related systems of three Anderson impurities coupled in series between two conduction channels. We\nanalyze new behavior that results from the presence of two\nequivalent screening channels (as in the 2CK model) combined with either two-stage Kondo screening [4] or magnetic\nordering [5], which both lead to a single uncompensated spin\nat intermediate temperatures. If the impurities are coupled\nonly by exchange interaction, the system has a NFL ground\nstate of the 2CK type with a residual ln 2/2 zero-temperature\nentropy [1, 14]. In the experimentally relevant case where\nthe exchange interaction is generated by the superexchange\nmechanism due to electron hopping, the channel symmetry is\n\nbroken and the system is described by the asymmetric 2CK\nmodel. We analyze the parameter ranges where NFL behavior\nis exhibited and identify the regime where the experimental\nobservation is most likely.\nModels. \u2013 We study the three-impurity models described\nby the Hamiltonian H = Hb + Himp + Hc , where Hb =\nP\n\u2020\n\u03bd,k,\u03c3 \u01ebk c\u03bdk\u03c3 c\u03bdk\u03c3 describes the left and right conduction\nP\nlead (\u03bd = L, R) and Hc = k\u03c3 Vk (c\u2020Lk\u03c3 d1\u03c3 + c\u2020Rk\u03c3 d3\u03c3 +\nH.c.) describes the coupling of the bands to the left and right\nimpurity (numbered 1 and 3, while 2 is the impurity in the\nmiddle).

We set J to the superexchange value of J = 4t2 /U\nto relate the two models for t \u226a U . Both models are particlehole (p-h) symmetric. Replacing spin exchange interaction\nwith hopping enables charge transfer between the channels\nand induces channel asymmetry [13, 15] which drives the system to a Fermi-liquid ground state [1].\nIn model I three different regimes are expected as t is decreased [16]: molecular-orbital (MO) Kondo regime, antiferromagnetic spin-chain (AFM) Kondo regime and two-stage\nKondo (TSK) regime. In MO regime, two electrons occupy bonding molecular orbital, while the third electron in\nnon-bonding orbital develops local moment which is Kondo\nscreened. In AFM regime, three on-site local moments bind\nat T \u223c J = 4t2 /U into a rigid antiferromagnetic spin-chain\n\n\f2\n\nt2\n\n2\n\nTSK\n\n0\n-1/4\n-1/2\n-4\n\n10\n\nt/D=0.0001\n\nMO\n\nAFM\n\nS1.S3\nS1.S2\n\n1/4\nt/D=0.2\n\n0\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n10\n10\n1/2\nt/D or (JU) /2D\n\n10\n\n-10\n\n0\n\nFigure 1: (Color online) Charge fluctuations and spin-spin correlations of model I (lines without symbols) and model II (lines with\nsymbols) as a function of the inter-dot coupling t (for model I) or corresponding J = 4t2 /U (for model II). The molecular-orbital (MO)\nregime is characterized by large on-site charge fluctuations, the antiferromagnetic spin-chain regime (AFM) by negative spin correlations of neighboring spins 1-2 and positive correlation of spins 1-3,\nand the two-stage Kondo regime (TSK) by vanishing spin correlations.\n\nwith total spin 1/2; this is followed by the screening of the\ncollective spin. In TSK regime, the moments are quenched\nsuccessively: on left and right dot at the upper Kondo temper(1)\nature TK , while on middle dot at an exponentially reduced\n(2)\nlower Kondo temperature TK [16, 17, 18, 19]. All three\nregimes become qualitatively similar at sufficiently low temperature: the remaining degree of freedom is one spin 1/2\ncoupled to two Fermi liquids. The most general effective\nHamiltonian describing model I that is allowed by the symmetries is the 2CK model with broken channel symmetry. Between TSK and AFM regimes, we identify a wide crossover\nregion where NFL behavior is experimentally most accessible.\nModel II has AFM and TSK regimes separated by the\ncrossover regime. There is clearly no MO regime; instead,\nthe AFM regime extends to the region of high J, where the\ntwo models describe very different physical systems. Since\nthe left and right conduction channels are not communicating (in the sense that there are no L \u2194 R cotunneling processes), the channel symmetry is maintained and a stable 2CK\nNFL ground state is expected for all J. In both models (I\nand II) NFL behavior sets in at the highest temperature in the\ncrossover regime.\nResults. \u2013 We performed calculations using the numerical renormalization group (NRG) method (\u039b = 4) [20].

For model I, the smooth crossover from MO\u221ato AFM regime, predicted to occur on the scale\nof t1 \u223c U/2 2 \u2248 0.35D [16], is reflected in the decrease\nof charge fluctuations and the increase of spin-spin correlations. The cross-over from AFM to TSK regime occurs when\n(1)\nJ \u223c TK or t2 \u223c 1.7 10\u22123 D: as t decreases past t2 the spinspin correlations tend toward zero as the spins decouple. For\nmodel II, the results in the TSK regime match closely those of\nmodel I, while in the AFM regime near t \u223c t1 the differences\nbecome notable. Large values of J \u226b \u0393 suppress charge fluctuations on side-dots, (\u03b4n1 )2 \u2192 0, while local moments on\nimpurities tend to form a well developed AFM spin-chain (for\ncomparison, in isolated three-site spin chain hS 1 *S 2 i = \u22121/2\nand hS 1 * S 3 i = 1/4).\nIn Fig. 2 we plot the impurity contribution to susceptibility and entropy. The ground state of model I is nondegenerate, simp = 0, and the impurities are fully screened for all t.\nIn MO regime the system undergoes single-channel Kondo\nscreening with TK that increases with t and becomes constant for t \u226b U , see Fig. 3. In AFM regime, the binding\nof spins is most clearly discernible in the curves calculated\nat t/D = 0.05 which show a kink in simp at 3 ln 2 (local\n\n\f10\n\n10\n\nMO\nt1\n\n-4\n\nTscr (I)\nTscr (II)\nJ\n(1)\nTK\nT\u2206\n\n-6\n\n10\n10\n\nAFM\n\nNFL\n\n-8\n\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\nTK\n\nT\u2206\n\nt/D = 0.005\n\n(I, S)\n0, 1/2\n0, 3/2\n1/2, 0\n1/2, 1\n1, 1/2\n\n2\n\nE\n\nT/D, J/D\n\n10\n\nTSK cross-over\nt2\n\n(simp/kB)/ln2\n\n3\n\n-10\n\nU/D=1\n\u0393/U=0.045\n\n-12\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n10\n10\n1/2\nt/D or (JU) /2D\n\n1\n\nU/D=1\n\u0393/D=0.045\n\n10\n\n0\n\nFigure 3: (Color online) Cross-over scales of models I and II as functions of the inter-dot coupling. The magnetic screening temperature Tscr is defined by Tscr \u03c7(Tscr )/(g\u03bcB )2 = 0.07; it is equal to\nthe Kondo temperature when screening is due to the single-channel\nKondo effect. T\u2206 is here defined as simp (T\u2206 )/kB = ln 2/4.\n\nmoment formation), followed by an exponential decrease to\nsimp = ln 2 at T \u223c 4t2 /U . The Kondo screening in AFM\nregime is of single-channel type for t/D & 0.02. Between\nt/D = 0.02 and t2 there is a cross-over regime with NFL-like\nproperties. Here magnetic ordering competes with the singlechannel Kondo screening of left and right impurity. The magnetic moment is rapidly quenched at T \u223c Tscr \u223c J, yet the\nentropy does not go to zero but exhibits a ln 2/2 NFL plateau.\nAt still lower temperature T\u2206 , NFL fixed point is destabilized by the channel asymmetry and the system crosses over to\nthe FL ground state characteristic of the conventional Kondo\nmodel. Note that in this regime Tscr is high while T\u2206 is low\n(Fig. 3), making this range suitable for experimental study of\nNFL physics.\nIn TSK regime, the left and right impurity are screened\n(1)\nby the single-channel Kondo effect at temperature TK that\nis nearly the same for all t . t2 (Fig. 3). The cen(2)\ntral impurity is screened by the 2CK effect at TK , below\nwhich the system is near the NFL fixed point with ln 2/2\n(2)\nentropy. In the inset to Fig. 2 we show that TK scales as\n(2)\n(1)\n(1)\nTK \u221d TK exp(\u2212bTK /J), as expected for the TSK effect\n[17, 18, 19].\nModel II has a stable NFL ground state. For low J, it has\n(2)\na TSK regime where the the Kondo temperature TK , determined by J, is lower than that of the corresponding model\nI, set by max{J1 , J2 } = J1 > J (Fig. 3). In the crossover\nregime physical properties of model II for T > T\u2206 match\nclosely those of model I. In AFM regime, the Kondo temperature is a non-monotonous function of J. The energy required\nto break the doublet spin-chain state increases with J and the\neffective Kondo exchange constant JK \u221d \u0393/J decreases. TK\ntherefore decreases exponentially with increasing J.\nFixed points. \u2013 By comparing NRG eigenvalue flows, we\nhave verified that for any t 6= 0 the model I flows to the same\nstrong coupling FL fixed point. The spectrum is a combination\n\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30 40 50 60\n-N/2\nN (odd) or T\u223c\u039b\n\n70\n\n80\n\nFigure 4: (Color online) NRG eigenvalue flow of model I (\u039b = 2,\nz = 1) in the cross-over regime (below) and the corresponding impurity entropy (above). The states are classified according to the total\nisospin and total spin quantum numbers, (I, S). Black full strips\ncorrespond to FL spectrum. Gray (red online) hatched strips are at\nenergies (after rescaling by 1.296) 1/8, 1/2, 5/8, 1 [14].\n\nof two FL spectra: one for odd-length and one for even-length\nfree electron Wilson chain [20]. Odd channel gathers a \u03c0/2\nphase shift, while even channel has zero phase shift. Since the\nconductance is given by G = G0 sin2 (\u03b4o \u2212 \u03b4e ) with G0 =\n2e2 /h, the system is fully conducting in its low-temperature\nground state for any non-zero t. Weak perturbations of the\nform H \u2032 = V ni are marginal, therefore the triple quantum\ndot system has an extended region of high conductance as a\nfunction of the gate voltage [16]. The unstable intermediate\ntemperature fixed-point spectrum of model I is in agreement\nwith the conformal field theory predictions for the 2CK model\n[14] (Fig. 4). The same fixed point is obtained for all J in\nmodel II.\nRobustness of the NFL regime. \u2013 In model I, the channel\nsymmetry is broken intrinsically by the inter-impurity hopping, which contributes a left-right cotunneling term of the\nform JLR S * (sLR + sRL ) to the effective Hamiltonian (sLR is\nP\n\u2020\nthe left-right spin operator sLR =\nkk\u2032 \u03b1\u03b2 cLk\u03b1 \u03c3 \u03b1\u03b2 cRk\u2032 \u03b2 )\n[13]. The impurities then couple to a symmetric and antisymmetric combination of channels with exchange constants\nJS,A = Javg \u00b1 JLR . The asymmetry parameter A = \u2206/J 2\nwith \u2206 = \u03c10 (JS \u2212JA ) = 2\u03c10 JLR and J = \u03c10 (JS +JA )/2 =\n\u03c10 Javg determines the cross-over scale T\u2206 /TK \u2248 A2 [6]. Estimating JS and JA for t/D = 0.005 using the SchriefferWolff transformation we obtain A2 \u223c 10\u22126 , to be compared\nwith T\u2206 /Tscr \u223c 10\u22125 determined by the NRG calculation.\nThe discrepancy appears due to competing magnetic ordering and Kondo screening (and emerging two-stage Kondo\nphysics); simple scaling approach fails in this case.\nWe have performed a range of calculations for various perturbations for t/D = 0.005. The ln 2/2 NFL plateau per\u2032\nsists\nPeven for large deviations from the p-h symmetry (H =\nV i ni up to V /U \u2248 0.2), for broken left-right symmetry or\nparity (H \u2032 = V (n1 \u2212 n3 ) up to V /U \u2248 0.2), and for unequal\n\n\f4\n1/2\n2\n\n\u03c0\u0393A1(\u03c9)\n\nGside\n\nJ=4t /U\n*\n-4\nTK \u223cJ=10 D\n\n1/4\n*\n\n-6\n\nU/2\n\nt/D=0.005 TK =2 10 D\nt/D=0.05\n\n4[\u03c0\u0393A13(\u03c9)]\n\n2\n\n0\n*\n\n3/4\n\n-10\n\nT\u2206 =7 10 D\n\n-7\n\n7 10 D\n\n1/2\n1/4\n\nU/D=1\n\u0393/U=0.045\n\n0 -12\n10\n\n10\n\n-10\n\nGserial\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n-6\n\n10\n\u03c9/D\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n0\n\nFigure 5: (Color online) Dynamic properties of model I in the AFM\n(dashed lines) and in the cross-over regime (full lines).

The only \"dangerous\" perturbations are those that increase the channel asymmetry; these\ncan be compensated in experiments by tuning on-site energies\nand hybridization strengths.\nTransport properties. \u2013 The qualitative temperature dependence of the zero-bias conductance through the system can be\ninferred in a very rough approximation from the frequency dependence of the spectral functions. The conductance through\nthe system is given by Gserial /G0 \u2248 4(\u03c0\u0393A13 )2 [21] and the\nconductance through a side dot in three terminal configuration\nby Gside /G0 \u2248 \u03c0\u0393A1 [22]. The appropriately normalized\nspectral densities are shown in Fig. 5 for the cases of crossover regime with a NFL region and AFM regime with no discernible NFL behavior. In the NFL region (t/D = 0.005 and\nT\u2206 . T . Tscr ), the conductance Gside \u223c 1/2G0 , while\nGserial \u223c 0. The increase of the conductance through the\nsystem at T . T\u2206 is concomitant with the cross-over from\nNFL to FL fixed point, since charge transfer (or, equivalently,\nchannel asymmetry) destabilizes the NFL fixed point like in\nthe two-impurity case [15]. In the AFM regime with no NFL\nregion, both conductances increase below the same temperature scale, i.e. T . Tscr . Measuring Gside and Gserial could\ntherefore serve as an experimental probe for observation of\nNFL physics.\nIn A1 (\u03c9), the Hubbard peak at U/2 corresponds to adding\nan electron to the site, while the \"magnetic-excitation\" peak\nat J appears when, after adding an electron, the electron with\nthe opposite spin hops from the impurity into the band. This\nbreaks the AFM spin chain, increasing the energy by J. This\nmagnetic peak evolves into a \"molecular-orbital\" peak at the\nenergy of the non-bonding orbital (for t in MO regime) or into\nthe Kondo peak of the side dot (for t in TSK regime). Note\nalso the different approach to the \u03c9 = 0 limit in FL and NFL\ncases.\nConclusion. \u2013 In a wide interval around the p-h symmet-\n\nric point, the triple quantum dot system has a FL ground state\nwith high conductance at T = 0. The different regimes exhibit\ndifferent approaches to this fixed point. The most likely candidate for observing 2CK behavior is the cross-over regime with\ncompeting magnetic ordering and Kondo screening, J \u223c TK .\nIn this regime the NFL behavior occurs in a wide temperature\nrange and it is fairly robust against various perturbation that do\nnot additionally increase the channel asymmetry. The signature of the NFL behavior can be detected by measuring Gside\nand Gserial in a three terminal configuration. Properly choosing parameters of the triple quantum dot system to set it into\nthe crossover regime represents a road map for observation of\nNFL behavior.\nWe remark that all systems of quantum dots described as\nKondo or Anderson impurities that are coupled to two noninteracting leads belong to the same class of quantum impurity\nproblems with four (spin and channel) flavors of bulk fermions\n[3, 23]. The boundary conformal field theory approach allows\nfor systematic determination of all possible non-trivial (NFL)\nfixed points. It would be interesting to investigate the inverse problem of finding the microscopic Hamiltonians which\nrenormalize to these points. Since RG transformations are not\ninvertible, this appears as a formidable task that would involve\nconsiderable guesswork. Nevertheless, its resolution would\nprovide important insight into a variety of possible experimental realizations of mesoscopic NFL systems with purely\nlocal interactions.\nThe authors acknowledge useful discussions with A.\nRam\u0161ak and the financial support of the SRA under Grant No.\nP1-0044.\n\n[1] D.
