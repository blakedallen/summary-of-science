These include the statements, in\nthree space dimensions, that vortex lines are material lines and that the flux\nwithin any vortex tube is a Lagrangian invariant. Lord Kelvin (1869) gave\nan elegant alternative formulation of these laws in terms of the conservation\nof circulation, for any closed loop advected by an ideal fluid. This theorem\nis equally valid in any space dimension. However, it is only rigorously proved\nfor sufficiently smooth solutions. As was pointed out by Onsager (1949), the\nclassical conservation laws need not be valid for singular solutions of Euler\nequations. In particular, breakdown of the energy conservation law can account for the anomalous dissipation of energy observed in turbulent fluids at\nEmail address: eyink@ams.jhu.edu (Gregory L. Eyink).\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Science\n\n10 November 2018\n\n\fhigh Reynolds numbers. From a physical point of view, this breakdown of\nenergy conservation corresponds to the turbulent energy cascade and a flux\nof energy to arbitrarily small scales. See also Eyink (1994),Constantin et al.\n(1994), Duchon & Robert (2000).\nThese considerations make it very natural to inquire whether Kelvin's theorem\nwill remain valid for singular solutions of the Euler equations. This question\nasumes some importance since the conservation of circulations was argued by\nTaylor (1938) to play a key role in the enhanced production of dissipation in\nturbulent fluids, by the process of vortex line-stretching. Despite its plausibility, the validity of Taylor's argument is far from clear. It is not obvious a priori\nwhy there should not be anomalous dissipation of the circulation invariants,\ncorresponding to a turbulent \"flux of circulations\" from large to small scales.\nIn this paper, we examine these questions and establish a few relevant rigorous results. In section 2 we briefly review the classical Kelvin-Helmholtz\ntheorem and its role in turbulence dynamics. In section 3 we prove a theorem\non conservation of circulations for singular solutions of incompressible Euler\nequations, analogous to that of Onsager (1949) for conservation of energy. In\nsection 4 we discuss difficulties in formulating the Kelvin theorem for singular\nsolutions, due to the breakdown in uniqueness of Lagrangian trajectories, and\nconjecture a statistical version of circulation-conservation which may apply.\n\n2\n\nThe Classical Kelvin Theorem\n\nThe velocity field u(x, t) solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation\n\u2202t u + (u*\u2207)u = \u2212\u2207p + \u03bd \u25b3 u,\n\n\u2207*u = 0\n\n(1)\n\nwith x \u2208 \u039b \u2282 Rd , for any integer d \u2265 2, satisfies the Kelvin-Helmholtz\ntheorem in the following sense: For any closed, rectifiable loop C \u2282 \u039b at an\nH\ninitial time t0 , the circulation \u0393(C, t) = C(t) u(t)*dx satisfies\nI\nd\n\u0393(C, t) = \u03bd\n\u25b3u(t)*dx,\ndt\n\n(2)\n\nC(t)\n\nwhere C(t) is the loop advected by the fluid velocity, at time t. E.g., see\nSaffman (1992), section \u00a71.6, for the standard derivation. It is worth observing\nthat the Kelvin theorem for all loops C is formally equivalent to the NavierStokes equation (1). Indeed, if u(x, t) is a smooth spacetime velocity field,\n2\n\n\fdiverence-free at all times t, then equation (2) implies that\nI\n\n[Dt u(t) \u2212 \u03bd \u25b3 u(t)] *dx = 0\n\n(3)\n\nC\n\nfor all loops C at every time t. Here Dt u = \u2202t u + (u*\u2207)u is the Lagrangian\ntime-derivative and the equation (3) is derived by applying (2) to the preimage of the loop C at initial time t0 . By Stokes theorem, equation (3) can\nhold for all loops C \u2282 \u039b if and only if there exists a pressure-field p(x, t)\nsuch that the Navier-Stokes equation (1) holds locally and also globally, if the\ndomain \u039b is simply connected.\nIn the inviscid limit \u03bd \u2192 0, the circulation is formally conserved for any initial\nloop C. The fluid equations in this limit, the incompressible Euler equations,\nare the equations of motion of a classical Hamiltonian system. They can be\nderived by the Hamilton-Maupertuis principle from the action functional\ntf\n\nZ\n1Z\nS[x] =\ndt da |\u1e8b(a, t)|2\n2\nt0\n\n(4)\n\n\u039b\n\nwith the pressure field p(x, t) a Lagrange multiplier to enforce the incompressibility constraint. Here x(a, t) is the Lagrangian flow map which satisfies\n\u1e8b(a, t) = u(x(a, t), t) with initial condition x(a, t0 ) = a. See Salmon (1988)\nfor a review. This variational principle yields the fluid equations in a Lagrangian formulation, as \u1e8d(a, t) = \u2212\u2207p(x(a, t), t). The Eulerian formulation\n(1) (with \u03bd = 0) is obtained by performing variations in the inverse map\na(x, t), or \"back-to-labels map\", with fixed particle positions x. This Hamiltonian system has an infinite-dimensional gauge symmetry group consisting of\nall volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of \u039b, which corresponds to all smooth\nchoices of initial fluid particle labels. In this framework, the conservation of\nthe circulations for all closed loops C emerges as a consequence of Noether's\ntheorem for the particle-relabelling symmetry. See Salmon (1988), Section 4.\nThe Kelvin theorem has many profound consequences for the dynamics of\nincompressible fluids. We just note here a well-known deduction for threedimensional turbulence by G. I. Taylor (1938). It is reasonable to assume that\nvortex lines-or, for that matter, any material lines-will tend to elongate under chaotic advection by a turbulent velocity field. Incompressibility requires\nthat the cross-sectional area of a vortex tube formed by such lines will shrink\nwith time. But, in that case, the Kelvin-Helmholtz theorem implies that the\nvorticity magnitude of the tube must grow. Taylor (1938) observed that this\nprocess of vortex line-stretching providesR an intrinsic mechanism for amplification of the net viscous dissipation \u03bd \u039b dx|\u03c9|2 , where \u03c9 = \u2207\u00d7u. More\nrecently, regularizations of the Navier-Stokes equation have been proposed as\n3\n\n\fmodel equations for large-scale turbulence by Holm et al. (1998); Foias et al.\n(2001), motivated by requiring that a Kelvin circulation theorem be preserved.\n\n3\n\nA Generalized Theorem on Conservation of Circulation\n\nThis line of reasoning of Taylor (1938) is quite delicate. It assumes certain\nproperties (material advection of vortex lines and conservation of circulations)\nthat can hold strictly only in the \u03bd \u2192 0 limit. However, conclusions are drawn\nabout the limiting behavior of the energy dissipation rate, which directly involves the kinematic viscosity \u03bd! Furthermore, as noted by Onsager (1949), the\nsolutions of the Navier-Stokes equation are not expected to remain smooth in\nthe inviscid limit. Thus, the righthand side of equation (2) does not necessarily\nvanish as \u03bd \u2192 0. Physically, there may be a dissipative anomaly for the conservation of circulations. If so, then the validity of Taylor's vortex-stretching\nmechanism for turbulent energy dissipation is open to serious question.\nThe formulation of turbulent conservation of circulation by a zero-viscosity\nlimit is physically natural, but not the most convenient either for numerical\ntests or for rigorous mathematical analysis 1 . We shall instead consider directly\nthe singular (or distributional) solutions u \u2208 L2 ([0, T ], \u039b) of the incompressible\nEuler equations, with \u03bd = 0. Let ul = Gl \u2217 u denote the low-pass filtered\nvelocity at length-scale l, where Gl (r) = l\u2212d G(r/l) is a smooth filter kernel.\nThen ul satisfies the following equation (in the sense of distributions in time):\n\u2202t ul + (ul *\u2207)ul = \u2212\u2207pl + fl ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere pl is the filtered pressure and where fl = \u2212\u2207*\u03c4 l is the subgrid force,\ni.e. minus the divergence of the stress-tensor \u03c4 l = (u u)l \u2212 ul ul . Let us choose\na rectifiable closed loop C in space. We define C l (t) as the loop C advected by\nthe filtered velocity ul . This definition makes sense, since the filtered velocity\nul is Lipschitz in space, and corresponding flow maps exist and are unique\n(DiPerna & Lions (1989)). We define aH \"large-scale circulation\" with initial\nloop C as the line-integral \u0393l (C, t) = C l (t) ul (t) * dx. The same calculation\nthat establishes the Kelvin circulation theorem for smooth solutions of Euler\n1\n\nFor example, the Kelvin theorem in the form of equation (2) is not proved to be\nvalid for the global solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation (1) constructed by Leray\n(1934). The difficulty here is that the Leray regularization of (1) does not preserve\nthe Kelvin theorem, while alternative regularizations which do, such as that of\nFoias et al. (2001), in turn modify the energy balance. See Constantin (2003).\n\n4\n\n\fequations gives that\n\u0393l (C, t) \u2212 \u0393l (C, t0 ) =\n\nZt\n\nd\u03c4\n\nt0\n\nI\n\nfl (\u03c4 ) * dx.\n\n(6)\n\nC l (\u03c4 )\n\nThus, the line-integral of fl on the RHS represents a \"flux\" to subgrid modes\nat length-scales < l of circulation on the loop C l (\u03c4 ). This motivates the definition, for any loop C and filter length l,\nKl (C, t) = \u2212\n\nI\n\nfl (t) * dx\n\n(7)\n\nC(t)\n\nso that (in generalized sense) (d/dt)\u0393l (C, t) = \u2212Kl (C, t).\nWe now prove the following:\nTheorem: Let \u03b6p be the pth-order scaling exponent of the velocity, in the sense\nthat it is the maximal value such that\n1\n|\u039b|\n\nZ\n\ndd x|\u03b4u(r; x)|p = O(|r|\u03b6p ),\n\n\u039b\n\nfor all |r| \u2264 r0 , where \u03b4u(r; x) = u(x + r) \u2212 u(x). Then for any smooth loop\nC\u2282\u039b\nI\nKl (C) = \u2212 fl * dx\nC\n\nsatisfies liml\u21920 Kl (C) = 0 if \u03b6p > (d \u2212 1) + (p/2) for any p \u2265 2.\nThe special case of this result for p = \u221e states that the \"circulation flux\" will\ngo to zero as l \u2192 0 if the smallest velocity H\u00f6lder exponent hmin is > 1/2. This\nis an exact analogue of the result of Onsager (1949) for vanishing of energy flux\nwhen hmin > 1/3. One can see that it is even easier for circulation-conservation\nto be anomalous than for energy-conservation.\nProof: Our argument is close to that given by Constantin et al. (1994) for the\nOnsager theorem.

The condition on\nthe scaling exponent in the statement of the theorem can rephrased as the\n\u03c3p\ncondition that u belong to the Besov space Bp,\u221e\n(\u039b) with \u03c3p = \u03b6p /p. (More\nproperly, we should replace \u03c3p by \u03c3p \u2212 \u01eb for any small \u01eb > 0.) Standard\ntrace theorems then imply that the restriction of u to the submanifold C\n\u03c3p \u2212(d\u22121)/p\nof codimension d \u2212 1 must satisfy u|C \u2208 Bp,\u221e\n(C).

If this bound is substituted into estimate (8) for circulation2\n\nOnly the case p = \u221e rigorously follows from standard trace theorems. The problem is that the intrinsic Besov space norms on the submanifold C measure only\nthe increments between points both on C. However, existing trace theorems im\u03c3p\u2032\nply that every element f \u2208 Bp,\u221e\n(C), \u03c3p\u2032 = \u03c3p \u2212 (d \u2212 1)/p is the restriction to\n\u03c3\np\n(\u039b).

In that case, it suffices to take p > 2(d \u2212 1) in order to\nshow that the circulation is conserved (in the sense that the flux vanishes for\nl \u2192 0.) This result applies to the 2D enstrophy cascade, since it is expected\nthere that \u03b6p = p, with only logarithmic corrections, for all p \u2265 2. See Eyink\n(2000). Thus, we expect that the Kelvin theorem holds in a strong sense -\nfor individual realizations-in the 2D enstrophy cascade. However, in the 3D\nenergy cascade the conditions of the theorem are not expected to be satisfied.\n\n4\n\nThe Role of Kelvin's Theorem for Singular Solutions\n\nEven assuming that the assumptions of our theorem are met, there are additional difficulties in justifying constancy of the circulation invariants. Vanishing of the circulation flux for loops of finite length, as established in our theorem, is not sufficient. In the first place, the material loop C l (t) is not expected\nto remain rectifiable as l \u2192 0, but instead to become a fractal curve C(t) with\nHausdorff dimension > 1 for any positive time t (Sreenivasan & Meneveau\n(1986)). Thus, we cannot immediately infer that the RHS of equation (6)\nvanishes as l \u2192 0, nor even make sense of the contour integral in that\nlimit. A possible approach here is to transform the RHS to label-space, as\nH\nC fl (xl (\u03c4 ), \u03c4 ) * dxl (\u03c4 ) where the map satisfies \u1e8bl (a, \u03c4 ) = ul (xl (a, \u03c4 ), \u03c4 ). This\ncan make sense as a Stieltjes integral on the loop C in label-space for H\u00f6lder\ncontinuous maps (e.g. see Young (1936)),Z\u00e4hle (1998)).\nHowever, there is a much more serious problem in formulating Kelvin's theorem for singular Euler solutions: it is not clear that material loops exist!\nRecent work on an idealized turbulence problem-the Kraichnan model of\nrandom advection-has shown that Lagrangian particle trajectories x(t), x\u2032 (t)\ncan explosively separate even when x0 = x\u20320 initially, if the advecting velocity\nfield is only H\u00f6lder continuous and not Lipschitz. See Bernard et al. (1998).\nMathematically, this is a consequence of the non-uniqueness of solutions to the\ninitial-value problem, while, physically, it corresponds to the two-particle turbulent diffusion of Richardson (1926). Le Jan & Raimond (2002, 2004) have\n|||f |||\u03c3p\u2032 = sup|r|\u2264\u03c1\n\u03c3p\u2032\n\n1\n\u03c3\u2032\n|r| p\n\nhR\n\n \u0303 p\nC ds|\u03b4 f (r)|\n\ni1/p\n\nis equivalent to the standard Besov semi-\n\nnorm on Bp,\u221e (C). Here r ranges over a ball of radius \u03c1 inside \u039b\n\n7\n\n\frigorously proved that there is a random process of Lagrangian particle paths\nx(t) in the Kraichnan model for a fixed realization of the advecting velocity and a fixed initial particle position. This phenomenon has been termed\nspontaneous stochasticity (Chaves et al. (2003)). A similar notion of \"generalized flow\" was proposed by Brenier (1989) for the problem of minimizing\nthe action (4). In his formulation, the action is generalized to a functional\nR\nRt\nS[P ] = 21 P (dx) t0f dt |\u1e8b(t)|2 , where P is a probability measure on pathspace, and he showed that minimizers always exist in this framework. Unfortunately, this notion does not permit one to define the concept of material\nlines and surfaces for ideal flow. A more natural generalization of the classical\naction would be of the form\n1\nS[P ] =\n2\n\nZ\n\nP (dx)\n\nZtf\n\ndt\n\nt0\n\nZ\n\nda |\u1e8b(a, t)|2\n\n(10)\n\n\u039b\n\nwhere P is now a probability measure on time-histories of measure-preserving\nmaps 3 . For any realization of such a random process and for any initial curve\nC the advected object C(t) = x(C, t) is well-defined and remains a (random)\ncurve for all time t, if the maps are continuous in space.\nLet us assume for the moment that the (very nontrivial) problem can be solved\nto construct such a generalized flow x(a, t), or stochastic process in the space\nof volume-preserving maps, which is hopefully a.s. H\u00f6lder continuous in space\nso that material loops C(t) exist as random, fractal curves. We would like to\n3\n\nThe Kraichnan model might also benefit from a formulation in terms of maps.\nu can be defined on spaces\nFormally, a group of Markov transition operators St,t\n\u2032\nof functionals of maps, with a fixed realization of the velocity u, via a KrylovVeretennikov expansion:\n\nu\nSt,t\n\u2032\n\n=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn\n\n(\u22121)\n\nn=0\n(t\u2212t1 )L0\n\ne\n\n\u0012\n\nZt\nt\u2032\n\ndt1\n\nZ\n\n\u039b\n\nda1\n\nZt1\n\nt\u2032\n\ndt2\n\nZ\n\nda2 * * *\n\n\u039b\n\ntZ\nn\u22121\nt\u2032\n\ndtn\n\nZ\n\ndan\n\n\u039b\n\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\ne(t1 \u2212t2 )L0 u(x(a2 ), t2 )*\ne(t2 \u2212t3 )L0\nu(x(a1 ), t1 )*\n\u03b4x(a1 )\n\u03b4x(a\n)\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b4\n\u2032\n(tn\u22121 \u2212tn )L0\n***e\nu(x(an ), tn )*\ne(tn \u2212t )L0 .\n\u03b4x(an )\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nCf. Le Jan & Raimond (2002, 2004). Here the time-integrals should be defined in\nthe Ito sense with respect to the white-noise velocity field u(x, t) and L0 is formally\nthe infinitesimal\ngenerator of a diffusion process on the space of maps, given by\nR\nR\n\u03b42\nL0 = 21 \u039b da \u039b da\u2032 Dij (x(a) \u2212 x(a\u2032 )) \u03b4xi (a)\u03b4x\n\u2032 .

It would be very interesting to\ngive rigorous meaning to this expansion, especially for the case where the advecting\nvelocity is only H\u00f6lder continuous but not Lipschitz in space\n\n8\n\n\fpresent some plausibility arguments in favor of the conjecture that circulations\nshall be conserved in a statistical sense. More precisely, we expect that the\ncirculations \u0393(C, t) for any initial smooth loop C shall be martingales of the\ngeneralized flow:\nE [\u0393(C, t)|\u0393(C, \u03c4 ), \u03c4 < t\u2032 ] = \u0393(C, t\u2032), for t > t\u2032 .\n\n(11)\n\nHere E[*] denotes the expectation over the ensemble of random Lagrangian\npaths and we have conditioned on the past circulation history {\u0393(C, \u03c4 ), \u03c4 < t\u2032 }.\nHeuristically,\n(d/dt)E [\u0393(C, t)|\u0393(C, \u03c4 ), \u03c4 < t\u2032 ] = \u2212 lim E [Kl (C, t)|\u0393(C, \u03c4 ), \u03c4 < t\u2032 ] . (12)\nl\u21920\n\nNote that the conditioning event involves scales of the order of the radius of\ngyration of the loops C(\u03c4 ), \u03c4 < t\u2032 , while the circulation-flux involves velocityincrements over separation lengths l \u2192 0. Therefore, we expect that Kolmogorov's idea of small-scale homogeneity (and isotropy) will apply. Note,\nhowever, that the homogeneous average of the subgrid force fl is zero, because\nit is the divergence of the stress tensor. From another point of view, the subgrid force will become increasingly irregular for l \u226a R(t) (the radius of the\nloop C(t)) and the sign of the integrand fl (xl (s, t))*x\u2032l (s, t) will oscillate more\nrapidly as a function of the arclength s. Thus, cancellations will occur. For\nthese reasons, we expect that the limit on the RHS of (12) shall vanish, implying (11). Another formal argument can be given by applying the Noether\ntheorem to the generalized action (10) and using the fact that a global minimizer must also minimize the action for the time segment [t\u2032 , tf ]. On the other\nhand, based upon our earlier theorem, it is very unlikely that circulation-flux\nwill vanish as l \u2192 0 in every realization, without any averaging.\nIn this section we have clearly indulged in some speculative thinking, but we\nhopefully have also succeeded in outlining the various difficulties in properly\nformulating Kelvin's theorem for turbulent solutions of the Euler equations.\nOur own view is that the Taylor (1938) mechanism of vortex line-stretching is\nthe underlying cause of enhanced dissipation in three-dimensional turbulence\nasymptotically at high Reynolds numbers. However, much work remains to\nelucidate the details of the subtle dynamics involved.\n\nReferences\nHelmholtz H: 1858, \u00dcber Integrale der hydrodynamischen Gleichungen welche\nden Wirbelbewegungen entsprechen, Crelles Journal 55, 25\u201355\nKelvin L: 1869, On vortex motion, Trans.
