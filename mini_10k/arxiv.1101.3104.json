Based on our theory we predict the behavior of the surface Hall\nconductivity for a doped topological insulator with a top gate, which can be directly compared with\nexperiments.\n\nTopological insulators (TI) are states of matter with\na bulk energy gap and topologically protected gapless\nedge states. Their most striking properties are their\ntopological responses, such as the quantized Hall conductance of integer quantum Hall (QH) states [1]. Recently,\na wide class of time-reversal (TR) symmetry protected\ntopological insulators has been discovered [2\u20135]. The\nthree-dimensional ones are crystalline materials with a\nbulk energy gap and massless linearly dispersing Diraclike surface states [6\u20138]. The topological responses of 3D\nTI can be observed when the surface states are gapped\nby magnetism [1] or superconductivity [10]. When the\nsurface states are gapped by magnetism, the TI obtains\na topological electromagnetic\ndescribed by the\nR response\n\u03b8 \u03b1\neffective action S\u03b8 = 2\u03c0\nd3 xdtE * B with \u03b1 = e2 /~c\n2\u03c0\nthe fine structure constant, and \u03b8 = \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0 [1].\nThis is a topological magneto-electric effect and can be\nobserved as a surface QH effect with a half integral quan1 e2\n\u03b8 e2\ntized Hall conductivity \u03c3xy = 2\u03c0\nh = (n + 2 ) h , with n\nan integer. For non-interacting topological insulators \u03b8\ncan be calculated explicitly as the Chern-Simons invariant of the geometrical gauge field defined in momentum\nspace [1, 11]. The topological response theory of 3D TI\ncan be obtained by a dimensional reduction from the 4D\ngeneralization of the quantum Hall effect [12].\nWith the recent systematic understanding of topological insulators, a natural question is whether only insulators can be topological: are there topological phenomena in gapless systems such as a Fermi liquid? In this\npaper, we develop a theory to characterize the intrinsic\nresponse properties in a generic 3D Fermi liquid. Although in a metallic system the response properties such\nas Hall conductivity are not quantized, there can still be\nintrinsic \"topological\" contributions that are determined\nby the Berry phase gauge field in momentum space and\nare independent of non-topological details such as energy\ndispersion away from the Fermi surfaces and impurities.\nAn interesting example of a 3D Fermi liquid with nontrivial topological response is a doped TI\u2013a system with\nthe band structure of a TI but with a finite bulk car-\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic picture of a doped TI with a ferromagnetic\nlayer on the surface. The spheres indicate the Fermi surface\nsize which is position dependent. Near the surface, the Fermi\nlevel lies in the gap.\n\nrier density. Here, we study the surface Hall conductivity of a doped TI with TR breaking field applied at\nthe surface, as illustrated in Fig. 1. (Some other behavior of doped TI inherited from the nearby TI has\nbeen studied recently [13, 14]). Unlike a TI, the surface Hall conductivity of a doped TI is not quantized,\nand is in general dependent on surface conditions. However, in the smooth boundary limit, where the changes of\nthe Fermi level and the band structure near the boundary are smooth on the scale of the mean free path, we\nshow that the surface Hall conductivity is determined\nby a topological invariant-the Chern-Simons invariant\nof the geometrical gauge field integrated over the twodimensional Fermi surface and the real space direction\nperpendicular to the boundary. We obtain our result by\ngeneralizing the dimensional reduction approach in Ref.\n[1] to metallic systems. Our result can be understood\nas a higher dimensional, inhomogeneity-induced generalization of the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect [15\u201318]\nand its interpretation as a topological property of Fermi\nliquids[19]. Our results for doped TI are relevant to the\ncurrent experiments on TI materials since all the known\n3D TI materials, such as Bi1\u2212x Sbx alloy[20, 21], Bi2 Se3\nand Bi2 Te3 [22\u201324], have finite residual carrier density,\nwhich has become a major experimental challenge for\nthe observation of topological effects in TI. We also nu-\n\n\f2\nmerically studied the surface Hall conductivity of doped\nBi2 Se3 with a simple surface T-breaking field using the\nfour band effective model [22, 25]; our results can be verified by zero-field transverse conductance measurements\nof Bi2 Se3 with a magnetic layer deposited on the surface\nand voltage applied at a top gate.\nConsider a Hamiltonian H3D [A\u03bc , \u03b8(r)] for a 3+1D noninteracting fermion system that is coupled to the electromagnetic gauge field A and that depends on a spatially\nvarying parameter \u03b8(r). For example, in a doped TI with\na boundary, \u03b8(r) may describe both the spatial variation\nof the Fermi energy and the change of band structure\nacross the boundary. Without losing generality, we can\ndefine \u03b8 = 0 and \u03c0 to describe the vacuum and the bulk\nof the doped TI, respectively. To study the surface of a\ndoped TI, we take \u03b8(r) = \u03b8(z) to depend on one direction of space, with \u03b8(z \u2192 \u2212\u221e) = \u03c0 deep in the bulk,\nwhile \u03b8(0) = 0 at the surface. When \u03b8 varies smoothly,\nat each point in space the system without external magnetic P\nfield is locally described by a Bloch Hamiltonian\nH = k c\u2020k h[k, \u03b8(z)]ck , where k = (kx , ky , kz ). For N\nbands, ck is a N -dimensional vector and h[k, \u03b8(z)] is\na N \u00d7 N Hermitian matrix. In the physical system \u03b8\nis defined in the region [0, \u03c0]. It is convenient to extend the definition of h[k, \u03b8] to \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0] by setting\nh[k, \u03b8] = T \u2020 h[\u2212k, 2\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8]T for \u03c0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 2\u03c0. Here T is\nthe time-reversal operator, and h[k, \u03b8] is continuous in \u03b8\nsince it is TR invariant at \u03b8 = 0, \u03c0.\nNow we study the electromagnetic response of the system, which is determined by the effective action\neiSeff [A\u03bc ,\u03b8] =\n\nZ\n\nDc\u0304Dcei\n\nR\n\nP\ndt[ i c\u0304i i\u2202t ci \u2212H3D [A,\u03b8]]\n\n.\n\n(1)\n\nThe DC Hall conductivity is determined by the quadratic\nterm in the action:\nZ\n1\nHall\nd3 xdt\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c3\u03c4 \u03c3\u03bc [\u03b8]A\u03bd \u2202\u03c3 A\u03c4 .\n(2)\nSeff [A\u03bc , \u03b8] =\n2\nwith the Greek letters \u03bc, \u03bd... = 0, 1, 2, 3 labeling the\ntime and space coordinates. The spatial components\n\u03c3i , i = 1, 2, 3 of the four vector \u03c3\u03bc are the Hall conductivity in yz, zx and xy plane, respectively; that\nis, \u03c3i = \u01ebijk \u03c3jk , with \u03c3jk the conductivity tensor. In\ngeneral, \u03c3i = \u03c3i [\u03b8(r)] is a functional of the inhomogeneous \u03b8(r). For a smooth function \u03b8(r), one can expand\n\u03b8(r) = \u03b80 + r * \u2207\u03b8(r)|r=0 with \u03b80 = \u03b8(r = 0).

In the case of a band insulator with a\ngap Eg , there is a length scale \u03be = ~v/Eg where v is a\ntypical velocity scale contained in the coupling between\nconduction and valence bands. The approach above is\nvalid as long as the characteristic scale of variations of \u03b8\nis much longer than \u03be, i.e., |\u2207\u03b8| \u226a 1/\u03be. For a perfect\nmetal, the gap vanishes and the Green's function in (4)\nand (5) is singular. With impurities, the Green's function obtains a finite self-energy 1/\u03c4 , which corresponds\nto a length scale l = vF \u03c4 , which is the mean-free path.\nThe mean-free path plays the role of \u03be in the insulator\ncase, and the expansion above applies to the system with\n|\u2207\u03b8| \u226a 1/l. Physically, the expansion applies because\nthe conductivity at position r will be insensitive to small\nchanges in \u03b8 that occur at r \u2032 when |r \u2032 \u2212 r| >> l. In other\nwords, the intrinsic contribution to the Hall conductivity calculated above applies in the \"dirty limit\" where\nthe Hamiltonian is smoothly varying on the scale of the\nmean-free path, although the value of the intrinsic Hall\nconductivity is independent of the impurity strength in\nthis limit. In general, the anomalous Hall conductivity of\na metal also receives extrinsic contributions arising from\nimpurity scattering, which are termed the side-jump and\nskew-scattering contributions [18]. Here we focus on the\nintrinsic contributions, which depend only on the nature\nof the Bloch states and their associated Berry phases. In\nthe case of ferromagnetic metals, the intrinsic contribution can dominate the full anomalous Hall conductivity\nin certain intermediate regimes of disorder [18]; thus we\nexpect that the intrinsic contribution that we calculate\nhere for the surface of a doped TI may also be the dominant contribution in certain regimes of disorder.\nUnder the condition discussed above, the gradient expansion can be done locally around each point in space,\nleading to a local Hall conductivity. For simplicity, we\nconsider \u03b8(r) = \u03b8(z) only varying along the z direction. The Hall conductivity in the xy plane is given by\n3\n\u03c3z (z) = C1z [\u03b8(z)] + G\n2\u03c0 [\u03b8(z)]\u2202z \u03b8(z). As shown in Fig.\n1, we consider a single interface at z = 0 between the\nvacuum at z > 0 and a doped topological insulator at\nz < 0. One can always take \u03b8 = \u2212\u03c0 for the bulk doped\nTI and \u03b8 = 0 for the vacuum, both of which are TR\n\n\f3\ninvariant. In such a situation, the\nR total current in the\n\u03bc\nxy-plane will be given by j2D\n= dzj \u03bc , from which we\nmay obtain the two-dimensional Hall conductivity \u03c3z2D =\nR\n2D;(1)\n2D;(2)\n2D;(1)\n=\n+P\n\u03c3z R . The first term \u03c3z\nR dz\u03c3z (z) = \u03c3z\n1\n\u03b1\n(z)n\u03b1 (k, z) is the\ndzC1z [\u03b80 (z)] = 4\u03c02 \u03b1 d3 kdzFxy\nintrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity of a homogeneous\nsystem[15, 16], where \u03b1 labels the occupied bands |\u03b1ki,\n\u03b1\nand n\u03b1 and Fxy\nare the occupation number and Berry\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\ncurvature of band \u03b1.

By TR symmetry\nit can\nR\u03c0\nbe proved that G3 (\u03b8) = G3 (\u2212\u03b8), so that 0 d\u03b8G3 (\u03b8) =\nR\n1 2\u03c0\n2 0 d\u03b8G3 (\u03b8).\nTherefore, as long as the start and end points are described by time-reversal invariant Hamiltonians, we find\nthat the integrated current response receives a contribution from:\n2D;(2)\n\u03c3xy\n\u2261 \u03c3z2D;(2) =\n\ne2 1\nf,\nh 2\n\n(6)\n\nR 2\u03c0\nwhere f = 0 G3 (\u03b8)d\u03b8, and we have recovered the units\ne2 /h. From the definition of G3 in Eq. (5) one can see\nthat \u03b8 plays exactly the same role as momentum and frequency. The integrand in Eq. (5) has a symmetric form\nif we view \u03b8 as a momentum component in an \"extra dimension.\" In the case of an insulator, f is a topological\ninvariant which is equal to the second Chern number associated with the Bloch states of the 4+1D Hamiltonian\nH[k, \u03b8]. For a TI, f will be odd, so one obtains a halfintegral quantized transverse conductivity at the surface\nof a TI, when the surface is fully gapped [1].\nFor a doped TI, the Green's functions have poles on\nthe Fermi surface, so that f is in general not quantized.\nHowever, f is still invariant upon arbitrary smooth deformations of the Green's function G(k, \u03b8, \u03c9) as long as the\ndeformation vanishes at the Fermi surface. Making use\nof such topological invariance, we are able to integrate\nover frequency \u03c9 and obtain the following expression for\nf (see Supplementary Materials for the proof):\n1\nf =\n32\u03c0 2\n\nZ\n\nBZ\n\n3\n\nd k\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\nd\u03b8Tr (Fab Fcd ) \u01ebabcd .\n\n(7)\n\n0\n\nHere Fab is the Berry curvature associated with the bands\nthat are filled, with a, b = 1, 2, 3, 4 labeling kx , ky , kz , \u03b8.\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03b1\u03b2\nMore explicitly Fab\n= \u2202a A\u03b1\u03b2\n,\nb \u2212 \u2202b Aa + i[Aa , Ab ]\n\u03b1\u03b2\niAa = h\u03b1k\u03b8|\u2202a |\u03b2k\u03b8i with \u03b1, \u03b2 running over filled bands.\nFormally, (7) looks the same as the second Chern number\nof the Berry phase gauge field that appears in the TI case.\n\nBand Bending\n\nBulk Fermi level\n\nFIG. 2: Left: blue indicates schematically the band bending,\ndisplaying metallic bulk but gapped surface. Red indicates\n2D\nvariation of \u03b8 from 0 to \u03c0. Right: numerical results for \u03c3xy\nas a function of the top gate carrier density ng = CVg /e. The\npenetration depth of the T-breaking perturbation is chosen\nto be \u03be = 1 nm, the depletion length is zd = ng /nb , the\nbulk carrier density nb = 1016 cm\u22123 , and the Fermi level is\nchosen to be 18 meV from the conduction band bottom [26].\nStarting from the bottom, the different curves correspond to\nm0 = 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 meV, respectively. The gate\ncarrier densities ng \u223c 1011 cm\u22122 are within experimentally\naccessible values.\n\nHowever, for metallic systems there are different numbers\nof filled bands inside and outside each Fermi surface, so\nthat the definition of Fab depends on the position of the\nFermi surface and therefore f is not a second Chern number. For example,\nif there is a single\nFermi surface, then\nR\nR\n32\u03c0 2 f = F F S T rF (1) \u2227 F (1) + BZ\\F F S T rF (0) \u2227 F (0) ,\n\nwhere F F S denotes the filled Fermi sea, F (1) is the Berry\ncurvature associated with filled bands inside the Fermi\nsurface, and F (0) is the curvature associated with filled\nbands outside of the Fermi surface.\nSince the second Chern form is a total derivative, f\ncan be expressed, modulo an integer, in terms of integrals\nover the Fermi surfaces. We find that the fractional part\nof f is:\nZ\n1 X\nf mod 1 =\n(8)\nLCS (APi ),\n8\u03c0 2 i F Si\nwhere LCS (A) = \u01ebijk T r[Ai \u2202j Ak + 2i\n3 Ai Aj Ak ] is the\nChern-Simons form. The sum is over the different Fermi\nsurfaces, where F Si labels the ith three-dimensional\nphase-space Fermi surface, and APi is the Berry connection associated with the partially filled bands that\nare crossing the ith Fermi surface, i.e. that have zero\nenergy for (k, \u03b8) \u2208 F Si . Eq. 8 is a consequence of a\nhighly non-trivial cancellation of cross-terms associated\nwith the non-Abelian CS forms, which is why only the\npartially filled bands participate. The proof of Eq. (7)\nand (8) is given in the Supplementary Materials.\nEq. (8) is an integral over the Berry connection involving only states at the Fermi surface. This is in direct\nanalogy to Haldane's result [19] that the fractional part\nof the intrinsic contribution to the anomalous Hall effect\nis due to the adiabatic phase acquired by quasiparticles\n\n\f4\npropagating on the Fermi surface. We see that inhomogeneities can also induce Berry phase contributions to\nthe anomalous Hall effect, the fractional part of which\ndepends only on states at the Fermi surface.\nNote that in order for the above results to hold, we\nhave assumed that \u03b8 varies slowly on the scale set by\nthe mean free path. We must also assume that the Fermi\nsurface vanishes near the surface of the material (see Figs.\n1 and 2); otherwise, the surface will cause a sharp jump\nin the Fermi level and cannot be treated as a smooth\nchange. If the Fermi level already lies in a gap at the\nsurface, then the sharp jump in the chemical potential\nwill not have consequences for the low energy physics.\nLet us now apply our result to calculate the surface\nHall conductivity of a realistic doped TI-doped Bi2 Se3 .\nFrom the discrepancy between bulk transport measurements like Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and surface\nmeasurements like ARPES, it has been noticed that the\nenergy bands of Bi2 Se3 (and Bi2 Te3 ) can bend upwards\nnear the surface, so that the Fermi level lies in the energy gap near the surface but in the conduction band\nin the bulk of the material (see Fig. 2) [26]. Such a\nsituation can be further tuned using a top gate voltage.\nThis can be described by our current approach since the\ngap near the surface effectively avoids the abrupt change\nin the band structure at the surface. The bulk of the\nsystem is TR invariant and can be described by the fourP (0)\nband effective model [2, 22] H0 [k] = \u01eb(k)I+ a da (k)\u0393a\nwith \u0393a , a = 0, 1, 2, 3 the Dirac matrices and all the pa(0)\nrameters da (k) and \u01eb(k) given in Ref. [2] (see also the\nSupplementary Materials).\nWe consider a T-breaking term induced by, e.g., magnetic dopants deposited at the surface. Recently, angleresolved photon emission (ARPES) experiments have observed a gap in the surface states of Mn doped Bi2 Te3\n[28], with the surface Fermi level lying in the gap. This\nsystem may provide an experimental realization of the\nsurface TR symmetry breaking, although further verification of the nature of the surface gap is still needed.\nThis can be described by adding the following surface\nterm to the Hamiltonian:\nH1 = eV (z) + m0 sin[\u03b8(z)]\u03933 \u2212 M0 (1 + cos[\u03b8(z)])\u03935 ,\n(9)\neCV\n\nwhere eV (z) = \u2212 4\u01eb\u01eb0g zd (1\u2212 zzd )2 is the potential induced\nby the top gate voltage, C is the capacitance per unit area\nof the dielectric separating the top gate and the surface\nof the TI, nb is the bulk carrier density of the TI, Vg is\nthe voltage applied at the top gate, zd = CVg /enb is the\ndepeletion width induced by the top gate, and \u01eb is the\nrelative dielectric constant of the TI [29] (see Supplementary Materials). Note that charge neutrality requires zd\nto be determined by the gate voltage, which reduced the\nnumber of free parameters in our calculation, allowing us\nto determine the Hall conductivity from realistic material\n\nparameters.\nWe assume that the band bending near the surface is\nentirely induced by the top gate. \u03b8(z) = \u03c0(1 \u2212 e\u2212|z|/\u03be )\ndescribes the surface TR symmetry breaking which decays exponentially versus the perpendicular distance z.\nThe penetration depth \u03be is set by the thickness of the\nlayer of Mn dopants deposited at the surface; we take\n\u03be \u2248 1nm, assuming they penetrate several atomic layers into the surface. In a real system the T-breaking\nterm may vary depending on details of the system. Here\nwe take a simple T-breaking term. The Hamiltonian\nH = H0 + H1 can still be written P\nin the Dirac form\nH[\u03b8(z), k] = (\u01eb(k) \u2212 \u03bc + eV (z))I + a da (k, \u03b8)\u0393a . All\nthe z dependence can be absorbed into the parameter \u03b8 by defining z(\u03b8) = \u2212\u03be ln |1 \u2212 \u03b8/\u03c0|. da (k, \u03b8) =\n(0)\nda (k, \u03b8) + \u03b4a,3 m0 sin[\u03b8] \u2212 \u03b4a,5 M0 (1 + cos[\u03b8(z)]). For this\n2D;(1)\nmodel Hamiltonian, \u03c3xy\nvanishes. f in Eq. (7) can\nbe shown (see Supplementary Materials) to be given by\nZ\n3\nd3 kd\u03b8\u01ebtabcd d\u02c6t \u2202x d\u02c6a \u2202y d\u02c6b \u2202z d\u02c6c \u2202\u03b8 d\u02c6d , (10)\nf =\u2212 2\n8\u03c0 F F S\nwhere the integral is carried over the outside of electron\nFermi pocket, denoted by F F S and d\u02c6 = d/|d|. As discussed earlier, \u03b8 can be viewed as the fourth momentum,\nplaying the same role as the three-dimensional momenta\nkx,y,z , and the three-dimensional phase space Fermi surface can be defined in the k, \u03b8 space.\nNumerical results of the surface Hall conductivity are\nshown in Fig. 2 as a function of the surface gate carrier density, ng = CVg , for different strengths of the gap\ninduced by the magnetization, m0 . Note our theory is\nonly valid when the surface is gapped. The Hall conductivity saturates to the quantized value e2 /2h in the\nlimit that zd \u2248 ng /nb \u226b \u03be. Physically this is because\nthe T-breaking, and thus the nonzero Hall conductivity,\nonly occurs in the range of z . \u03be. For \u03be \u226a zd the system\nis insulating in the range of z . \u03be, so that the surface\nHall conductivity remains at the quantized value of TI\nsurface. As expected, in the limit of low carrier density the Hall conductivity also approaches e2 /2h, which\nis dramatically different from an ordinary semiconductor\nin which the intrinsic Hall conductivity always vanishes\nin the limit of zero carrier density.\nIf observed, such a gate tunability of Hall conductivity\nin a bulk crystal provides a unique signature of doped TI\ncompared to ordinary bulk semiconductors. We note that\nwhile disorder may add extrinsic contributions to the surface Hall conductance that we calculate here, these contributions vanish as the gate voltage is increased and the\nquantized e2 /2h value is recovered. Our work provides\nquantitative estimates for achieving the quantized value,\nand by comparing with measurements, can be used as a\nway to estimate the strength of extrinsic contributions\nto the surface Hall conductance. Following the approach\nof Ref. [1] for topological insulators, our results can also\n\n\f5\nbe extended to general dimensions. Such generalizations\nlead to a framework to study topological phenomena in\nFermi liquids in generic dimensions, which we investigate\nin future work.\nAcknowledgement.- We acknowledge S.C.

For a\nmetal, f is not quantized; despite appearances, it is not a second Chern number because the definition of the matrix\nF is such that its dimension changes at different points in momentum space, depending on the location of the Fermi\nsurface(s).\n\n\f6\nThe sections below are organized as follows. We begin by first manipulating the expression in terms of Green's\nfunctions into a more useful form. Next, we point out that even though f is not invariant under arbitrary deformations\nof the band structure, it is invariant under a certain class of deformations that we discuss. Following this, we prove\nsome mathematical identities that the Berry connections of the Bloch bands must generally satisfy. Finally, after\ndeveloping these ideas, we show how to use them to prove eqns. (11) and (12). We end with a discussion of the\ncalculation of f in the simpler case of the Dirac models (Eq.

The important point to note here is that x(k) and y(k)\ni\ndo not depend on the slope of the the dispersion, \u2202i \u03be\u03b1 , while z(k) does.\nNote that in the sum in z(k), all three bands \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 must have different energies. Consequently, for a special\nclass of models such as the Dirac-type models, which have only two bands with distinct energies (each of which\ngenerically has a degeneracy), z(k) must be zero. In these cases, it is easy to show that the integrand in the remaining\nterms are independent of the energy spectrum and are proportional to T rF \u2227 F . Thus a direct and explicit evaluation\nof x(k) + y(k) reveals eq. (F1).\n\nTopological invariance of f upon smooth deformations of G\n\nFor general band structures with three or more distinct energy levels, the proof of eq. (11) is more nontrivial and it\nis essential to exploit the topological invariance of f to deformations that preserve the band structure near the Fermi\nsurface. Under a smooth deformation of G to G + \u03b4G, the variation of f is given by\ni\u03c0 2 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3\u03c4\n\u01eb\n\u03b4f =\n15\n\nZ\n\nd4 kd\u03c9\n\u2202\u03bc T r[(G\u22121 \u03b4G)(\u2202\u03bd G\u22121 G)(\u2202\u03bd G\u22121 G)(\u2202\u03bd G\u22121 G)(\u2202\u03bd G\u22121 G)].\n(2\u03c0)5\n\n(21)\n\nNote that a deformation of the band structure that changes the location of the Fermi surface is not a smooth\ndeformation, because it can move the poles of G from the upper half plane to the lower half plane (or vice versa), and\nthese are not small changes. Therefore, a small deformation of the band structure corresponds to a small deformation\nof G provided that it is away from the Fermi surface. Thus we can only deform the band structure if we keep a small\nwindow near the Fermi surface unchanged. Observe that since the integrand in (21) is a total derivative, it will vanish\nif \u03b4G vanishes at the boundaries of the integral. Therefore, we can deform an arbitrary band structure (Fig. 3a) into\na flat band dispersion (Fig. 3b), where the band structure is unchanged in a small window near the Fermi surface.\nWe may take the limit that the size of the window goes to zero at the end of the calculation.\n\n\f8\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\nEf\n\nEf\n\nFIG. 3: (a) Cross-section of a generic band structure, with the Fermi level lying within a band.

F (M) is the curvature associated with M\nbands, including m bands below the Fermi surface labeled by \u03b3 and M \u2212 m bands crossing the Fermi surface labeled\nby P . Our proof will require us to be able to set \u03beP (k) > \u03be\u03b3 (k) for all k, so (22) is true only for those bands for which\nthis is possible.\nFirst we observe that for an insulator,\nZ\n1\nf=\nT rF \u2227 F ,\n(23)\n32\u03c0 2 BZ\nwhere F is the field strength of the Berry connection associated with the filled bands. This formula is easy to prove\nin the case that the bands are all flat, with the empty/filled bands having energy \u03beE or \u03beF , respectively [1]. For a\ngeneral band structure, it is argued that f is invariant under deformations of the band structure, and so its value is\ngiven by deforming the energy dispersions to the flat band model. This means that the terms in (20) that depend\non energy must vanish, imposing various constraints on the properties of the Berry connections. (22) is one of these\nconstraints; here we will derive it, along with some others as well.\nFirst we consider a band structure with flat energy dispersions \u03beE , \u03beP , and \u03beF , each of which may be multiply\ndegenerate.

When the bands are all flat, z(k) = 0, so f = \u2212 i\u03c03\ny).

The parameters are given in Ref. [2]; we list them in Table\nI for completeness.\nEFFECT OF TOP GATING AT THE SURFACE OF A DOPED TOPOLOGICAL INSULATOR\n\nHere we would like to develop a calculation of the effect of gating at the surface of a doped topological insulator.\nWe assume that the chemical potential is slightly above the bottom of the conduction band, and that the conduction\nband bends upward so that at the surface, the chemical potential lies in the bulk band gap. We also assume that a\ngap m has opened in the Dirac surface states and that the chemical potential is always inside of this gap.\nIn the simplest depletion length approximation, we assume that within a depletion length zd from the surface, there\nare no carriers; if the bulk doping charge density is \u2212enb , where nb is the bulk carrier density, this means that there\nis a constant positive charge density enb in the depletion region. In order to maintain overall charge neutrality, there\nmust be a compensating negative charge near the surface. Let us assume that all of this compensating negative charge\ncomes from the application of a top gate. In practice this is not entirely true, but it may be a good approximation.\nWith such an approximation, we have:\nVg C = enb zd ,\n\n(65)\n\n\f15\nwhere C is the capacitance per unit area of the region between the metallic top gate and the surface of the material.\nThis negative charge is accumulated in a metal gate a distance d from the surface of the material. Thus, the profile\nof the charge density is:\n\u03c1(z) = \u2212CVg \u03b4(z + d) + enb z,\n\nz \u2264 zd\n\n(66)\n\nNote that z = 0 is the surface of the material, and z = \u2212d is the position of the top gate. The potential V (z) is\ntherefore given by\nd2 V /dz 2 = \u2212\u03c1(z)/(\u01eb(z)\u01eb0 ),\n\n(67)\n\nwhere \u01eb(z) = \u01ebg for \u2212d < z < 0 is the dielectric constant of the dielectric that is in between the metal gate and the\nsurface of the material, and \u01eb(z) = \u01eb for z > 0 is the dielectric constant of the topological insulator.\nWe are interested in V (z) for z > 0. For simplicity, let us assume that d \u2248 0. The electric field in the region\n0 \u2264 z \u2264 zd is:\nE(z) = \u2212\n\nenb\nCVg\n+\nz.\n2\u01eb\u01eb0\n2\u01eb\u01eb0\n\n(68)\n\nThe potential is then\nV (z) = \u2212\n\nZ\n\nz\n\nzd\n\nE(z) = \u2212\n\nen2g\nCVg\nz\nznb 2\nzd (1 \u2212 )2 = \u2212\n(1 \u2212\n)\n4\u01eb\u01eb0\nzd\n4\u01eb\u01eb0 nb\nng\n\n(69)\n\nThe potential energy associated with this is eV (z). Note that zd = Vg C/enb = ng /nb , where ng is the number density\nof carriers on the top gate.\nThus, we would like to fix the penetration depth of the magnetization, \u03be, the gap of the Dirac surface states m\n(which is induced by the magnetization), and the bulk density nb , and then study the surface transverse conductance\nas a function of the gate voltage Vg . For Bi2 Se3 , we take \u01eb \u2248 100, so \u01eb\u01eb0 \u2248 8.8510\u221212F/cm.\n\n[2] C.-X. Liu, X.-L. Qi, H. Zhang, X. Dai, Z. Fang, and S.-C.\nZhang, Phys. Rev.
