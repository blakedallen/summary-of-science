For example, for every 0 \u2264 f \u2264 g, we find the dimension of the locus of\nhyperelliptic curves of genus g with p-rank at most f . We also produce families of\ncurves so that the p-torsion of the Jacobian of each fibre contains multiple copies\nof the group scheme \u03b1 p . The method is to study curves which admit an action by\n(Z/2)n so that the quotient is a projective line. As a result, some of these families\nintersect the hyperelliptic locus H g .\n\n1 Introduction\nWhen investigating abelian varieties defined over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p, it is natural to study the invariants related to their p-torsion such as their p-rank\nor a-number. Such invariants are well-understood and have been used to define stratifications of the moduli space A g of principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension g.\nThere is a deep interest in understanding whether the Torelli locus intersects such strata in\nA g . More generally, one can ask for the dimension of the intersection of these strata with\nthe image of the moduli spaces M g or H g under the Torelli map. In this paper, we show\nthat the Torelli locus intersects several of these strata by producing families of curves so\nthat the p-torsion of the Jacobian of each fibre contains certain group schemes.\nRecall that the group scheme \u03bc p = \u03bc p,k is the kernel of Frobenius on Gm and the group\nscheme \u03b1 p = \u03b1 p,k is the kernel of Frobenius on Ga . As schemes, \u03bc p \u2243 Spec(k[x]/(x\u22121) p)\nand \u03b1 p \u2243 Spec(k[x]/x p ) over k. If Jac(X ) is the Jacobian of a k-curve X , the p-rank of X\nis dimF p Hom(\u03bc p , Jac(X )) and the a-number of X is dimk Hom(\u03b1 p, Jac(X )).\nLet Vg, f denote the sublocus of M g consisting of curves of genus g with p-rank at\nmost f . For every g and every 0 \u2264 f \u2264 g, the locus Vg, f has codimension g \u2212 f in M g ,\n[1]. In Section 2, we use results from [1] to prove that there exist smooth hyperelliptic\ncurves of genus g with every possible p-rank f .\n\u2217 The\n\nauthors were partially supported by NSF VIGRE grant DMS-98-10750.\n\n1\n\n\fTheorem 2.3. For all g \u2265 1 and all 0 \u2264 f \u2264 g, the locus Vg, f \u2229 H g is non-empty of\ndimension g \u2212 1 + f . In particular, there exists a smooth hyperelliptic curve of genus g\nand p-rank f .\nLet Tg,a denote the sublocus of M g consisting of curves of genus g with a-number at\nleast a. In Section 5, we show that Tg,a is non-empty under certain conditions on g and a\nby producing curves X so that Jac(X )[p] contains multiple copies of \u03b1 p . Let H g,n be the\nsublocus of the moduli space M g consisting of smooth curves of genus g which admit an\naction by (Z/2)n so that the quotient is a projective line.\nCorollary 5.3. Suppose n \u2265 2 and p \u2265 2n + 1. Suppose g is such that H g,n is non-empty\nof dimension at least n + 1. Then the intersection H g,n \u2229 Tg,n has codimension at most n\nin H g,n . In particular, there exists a smooth curve of genus g with a-number at least n.\nThe dimension of the family in Corollary 5.3 is at least (g + 2n \u2212 1)/2n\u22122 \u2212 3 \u2212 n. The\nprecise numerical conditions for g can be found in Section 5. The main interest in this\nresult is not only that certain group schemes occur in the p-torsion of the Jacobians, but\nalso that the dimension of the families is large in comparison with the dimension of H g,n .\nFor small values of n, we further show that these families of curves intersect the hyperelliptic locus H g , resulting in the following corollaries.\nCorollary 5.4. Suppose g \u2265 2 and p \u2265 5. There exists a (g \u2212 2)-dimensional family of\nsmooth hyperelliptic curves of genus g whose fibres have a-number 2 and p-rank g \u2212 2.\nCorollary 5.5. Suppose g \u2265 5 is odd and p \u2265 7. There exists a (g \u2212 5)/2-dimensional\nfamily of smooth hyperelliptic curves of genus g whose fibres have a-number at least 3.\nIn Section 6, we consider the problem of constructing Jacobians whose p-torsion contains group schemes other than \u03bc p or \u03b1 p . We prove that for all g \u2265 2 there exists a smooth\nhyperelliptic curve of genus g whose p-torsion contains the group scheme corresponding\nto a supersingular non-superspecial abelian surface. We describe this group scheme and\nits covariant Dieudonn\u00e9 module in Section 6. It has a-number 1 and p-rank 0.\nOur method for these results is to analyze the curves in the locus H g,n in terms of\nfibre products of hyperelliptic curves. In Section 3, we extend results of Kani and Rosen\n[8] to compare the p-torsion of the Jacobian of a curve X in H g,n to the p-torsion of the\nJacobians of its Z/2Z-quotients up to isomorphism. We then use Yui's description of\nthe branch locus of a non-ordinary hyperelliptic curve, [17]. In some cases, this reduces\nthe study of the p-torsion of the Jacobian of X to the study of the intersection of some\nsubvarieties in the configuration space of branch points. We consider this in Section 4.\nThroughout, k is an algebraically closed field of characteristic p > 2. We assume g \u2265 1\nto avoid trivial cases. Without further comment, we will speak of a fibre of a relative curve\nwhen we mean a geometric fibre.\nThis paper led us to pose some open questions on this topic in [2]. We would like to\nthank E. Goren for suggesting the topic of this paper, E. Kani for help with Proposition\n3.6, and J. Achter, I. Bouw, F. Oort, and the referee for helpful comments.\n2\n\n\f2 Curves with prescribed p-rank\nWe begin by considering the p-rank of Jacobians of hyperelliptic curves. Recall that the\np-rank, dimF p Hom(\u03bc p, Jac(X )), of a k-curve X is an integer between 0 and its genus g.\nThe curve X is said to be ordinary if it has p-rank equal to g. In other words, X is ordinary\nif Jac(X )[p] \u223c\n= (Z/p \u2295 \u03bc p )g . Let Vg, f denote the sublocus of M g consisting of curves of\ngenus g with p-rank at most f .\nConsider the moduli space H g of smooth hyperelliptic curves of genus g and its closure\nH g in M g . It is known that H g is affine of dimension 2g \u2212 1. Both H g and H g are\nsmooth algebraic stacks over Z[1/2] (for example, see [16, Proposition 1]). Since k is an\nalgebraically closed field, this fact implies that if two subvarieties of H g intersect then\nthe codimension of their intersection is at most the sum of their codimensions.\nThe boundary H g \u2212 H g consists of components \u22060 and \u2206i for integers 1 \u2264 i \u2264 g/2.\nThe generic point of \u2206i corresponds to the isomorphism class of a singular curve with\ntwo irreducible components Xi and Xg\u2212i intersecting in a node which we denote Pi . Here\nXi (resp. Xg\u2212i ) is a hyperelliptic curve of genus i (resp. g \u2212 i) and the point Pi is fixed by\nthe hyperelliptic involution on Xi (resp. Xg\u2212i ). The generic point of \u22060 corresponds to the\nisomorphism class of an irreducible hyperelliptic curve X0\u2032 with a node. The normalization\nX0 of X0\u2032 is a hyperelliptic curve of genus g \u2212 1, and the inverse image of the node in X0\u2032\nconsists of two distinct points in X0 which are exchanged by the hyperelliptic involution.\nNote that Jac(X0\u2032 ) is a semi-abelian variety and the toric part of its p-torsion contains a\ncopy of the group scheme \u03bc p . So \u22060 \u2229Vg,0 is empty in M g .\nWe first show that each component of Vg,0 \u2229 H g has dimension g \u2212 1.\nProposition 2.1. The locus Vg,0 \u2229 H\n\ng\n\nis pure of codimension g in H g .\n\nProof. We work by induction on g. The statement is true in the case g = 1 since the locus\nof supersingular elliptic curves has dimension 0. Assume that the statement is true for\nall g\u2032 < g, and consider any component C0 of the intersection Vg,0 \u2229 H g . By the purity\nargument of [10, 1.6], the codimension of C0 in H g is at most g. Furthermore, C0 intersects the boundary of H g because H g is affine. Since C0 does not intersect \u22060 , it must\nintersect \u2206i for some 1 \u2264 i \u2264 g/2. We fix one such \u2206i and consider the dimension of the\nintersection.\nA curve corresponding to a point in the intersection of C0 and \u2206i is formed from two\nhyperelliptic curves Xi and Xg\u2212i which must both have p-rank 0. Thus Xi corresponds\nto a point of Vi,0 \u2229 H i and likewise Xg\u2212i corresponds to a point of Vg\u2212i,0 \u2229 H g\u2212i . By\nthe inductive hypothesis, there is at most an i \u2212 1 (resp. g \u2212 i \u2212 1) dimensional family of\nchoices for Xi (resp. Xg\u2212i ). Since Xi and Xg\u2212i intersect in a unique point Pi , this point must\nbe fixed under the hyperelliptic involutions of the two curves. Thus there are only finitely\nmany choices for the point Pi . It follows that dim(C0 \u2229 \u2206i ) \u2264 (i \u2212 1) + (g \u2212 i \u2212 1) + 0 =\ng \u2212 2 and the codimension of C0 \u2229 \u2206i in H g is at least g + 1.\n\n3\n\n\fWe can deduce that codim(C0 \u2229 \u2206i ) \u2264 codim(C0 ) + 1 in H g from the fact that \u2206i has\ncodimension 1 in H g . This implies that the codimension of C0 in H g is exactly g and\ntherefore that Vg,0 \u2229 H g is pure of codimension g in H g .\nNext we show that each component of Vg, f \u2229 H\nProposition 2.2. The locus Vg, f \u2229 H\n\ng\n\ng\n\nhas dimension g \u2212 1 + f (for g \u2265 1).\n\nis pure of codimension g \u2212 f in H g .\n\nProof. By Proposition 2.1, we can suppose f \u2265 1. Consider a component C0 of Vg, f \u2229 H g .\nBy [10, 1.6], C0 has codimension at most g\u2212 f in H g and thus dimension at least g\u22121+ f .\nBecause p > 2, a complete subvariety of H g \u2212 \u22060 has dimension at most g \u2212 1, by [1,\nLemma 2.6]. So C0 intersects \u22060 .\nA point of C0 \u2229 \u22060 corresponds to a curve X0\u2032 self-intersecting in a node P0 . The\nnormalization X0 of X0\u2032 is a hyperelliptic curve of genus g \u2212 1. Since the toric part of\nJac(X0\u2032 )[p] contains a copy of the group scheme \u03bc p , this implies that the p-rank of X0 is\nat most f \u2212 1. So X0 corresponds to a point of Vg\u22121, f \u22121 \u2229 H g . The choice of the nodal\npoint P0 is equivalent to a choice of two distinct points of X0 which are exchanged by the\nhyperelliptic involution. So dim(C0 \u2229 \u22060 ) = dim(Vg\u22121, f \u22121 \u2229 H g ) + 1.\nFurthermore, codim(C0 ) \u2265 codim(C0 \u2229 \u22060 ) \u2212 codim(\u22060 ) in H g . A calculation shows\nthat the codimension of C0 in H g is at least the codimension of Vg\u22121, f \u22121 \u2229 H g\u22121 in H g\u22121 .\nRepeating this calculation, we see that the codimension of C0 in H g is at least the codimension of Vg\u2212 f ,0 \u2229 H g\u2212 f in H g\u2212 f , which by Proposition 2.1 is g \u2212 f . It follows that\nVg, f \u2229 H g is pure of codimension g \u2212 f in H g .\nThis is the main result in the paper on the p-rank of hyperelliptic curves.\nTheorem 2.3. For all g \u2265 1 and all 0 \u2264 f \u2264 g, the locus Vg, f \u2229 H g is non-empty of dimension g \u2212 1 + f . In particular, there exists a smooth hyperelliptic curve of genus g and\np-rank f .\nProof. By [1, Proposition 2.7], there exists a smooth hyperelliptic curve X of genus g and\np-rank equal to zero for all g \u2265 1. For 0 \u2264 f \u2264 g, let C f be the component of Vg, f \u2229 H g\ncontaining X . By Proposition 2.2, C f has codimension g\u2212 f in H g . It follows that C f \u2229 H g\nhas dimension g \u2212 1 + f since C f is not contained in the boundary of H g . Now C f \u22121 has\ncodimension only g \u2212 f + 1 in H g . So the generic point of C f is a smooth hyperelliptic\ncurve with p-rank exactly f .\nWe now turn to the question of constructing Jacobians of curves with large a-number.\nTo do this, we first analyze the Jacobians of fibre products of hyperelliptic curves in\nSection 3 and then analyze the geometry of the branch points of non-ordinary hyperelliptic\ncurves in Section 4. Unless specified otherwise, the results in the next two sections are\nalso valid in characteristic 0 (but not in characteristic 2).\n4\n\n\f3 Fibre products of hyperelliptic curves\nLet G be an elementary abelian 2-group of order 2n . In this section, we describe G-Galois\ncovers \u03c6 : X \u2192 P1k where X is a smooth projective k-curve of genus g. For such a cover\n\u03c6, we show that the Jacobian of X decomposes into 2n \u2212 1 factors which are Jacobians as\nwell. We study some geometric properties of the Hurwitz space Hg,n which parametrizes\nisomorphism classes of such covers \u03c6.\n\n3.1 The moduli space Hg,n\nWe first recall a result about the coarse moduli space parametrizing isomorphism classes\nof G-Galois covers \u03c6 : X \u2192 P1k where X is a smooth projective k-curve of genus g. This\ndescription is related to the theory of Hurwitz schemes and gives a framework to describe\nthese covers. In particular, this framework allows one to consider families of such covers\nwith varying branch locus, to lift such a cover from characteristic p to characteristic 0, or\nto study the locus in M g of curves with a certain type of action by G.\nTo be precise, let Fg,n be the contravariant functor which associates to any k-scheme\n\u03a9 the set of isomorphism classes of (Z/2)n -Galois covers \u03c6\u03a9 : X\u03a9 \u2192 P1\u03a9 where X is a\nflat \u03a9-curve whose fibres are smooth projective curves of genus g and where the branch\nlocus B of \u03c6\u03a9 is a simple horizontal divisor. In other words, the branch locus consists\nof \u03a9-points of P1\u03a9 which do not intersect. Since each inertia group is a cyclic group of\norder 2, the Riemann-Hurwitz formula implies g = 2n\u22122 |B| \u2212 2n + 1. The following facts\nabout the Hurwitz scheme which coarsely represents this functor are well-known over the\ncomplex numbers.\nLemma 3.1. i) There exists a coarse moduli space Hg,n for the functor Fg,n which is of\nfinite type over Z[1/2].\nii) There is a natural morphism \u03c4 : Hg,n \u2192 M g whose fibres have dimension three.\niii) There is a natural morphism \u03b2 : Hg,n \u2192 P|B| which is proper and \u00e9tale over the image.\nProof. See [15, Chapter 10] for the construction of Hg,n and the morphisms \u03c4 and \u03b2 over\nC. The corresponding statements over Z[1/2] follow from [16, Theorem 4].\nWe recall some of the details about the morphisms \u03c4 and \u03b2. The morphism \u03c4 associates\nto any \u03a9-point of Hg,n the isomorphism class of X\u03a9 , where \u03c6\u03a9 : X\u03a9 \u2192 P1\u03a9 is the corresponding cover of \u03a9-curves. The fibres have dimension three since X\u03a9 is isotrivial if and\nonly if after an \u00e9tale base change from \u03a9 to \u03a9\u2032 there is a projective linear transformation\n\u03c1 such that \u03c1\u03c6\u03a9\u2032 is constant, [12, Lemma 2.1.2].\nThe morphism \u03b2 associates to any \u03a9-point of Hg,n the \u03a9-point of the configuration\nspace P|B| determined by the branch locus of the associated cover. More specifically, \u03b2\nassociates to any cover \u03c6\u03a9 : X\u03a9 \u2192 P1\u03a9 the \u03a9-point [a0 : . . . : a|B| ] of P|B| where ai are the\ncoefficients of the polynomial whose roots are the branch points of \u03c6\u03a9 . Note that the\nk-points of the image of \u03b2 correspond to polynomials with no multiple roots.\n5\n\n\fWe denote by H g,n the image \u03c4(Hg,n) in M g . Given a smooth connected k-curve X ,\nthen X corresponds to a point of H g,n if and only if there exists a subgroup G \u2282 Aut(X )\nwith quotient X /G \u2243 P1 . Note that H g,1 is simply the locus H g of hyperelliptic curves in\nM g.\nIt is often more useful to describe the branch locus of \u03c6\u03a9 directly as an \u03a9-point of\n1\n(P )|B| . This can be done by considering an ordering of the branch points of \u03c6\u03a9 . The\nbranch locus of a cover corresponding to a k-point of Hg,n can be any k-point of (P1 )|B| \u2212\u2206\nwhere \u2206 is the weak diagonal consisting of points having at least two equal coordinates. In\nparticular, for any \u03a9-point (b1 , . . ., b2g+2 ) of (P1 )2g+2 \u2212 \u2206 there is a unique hyperelliptic\ncover \u03c6\u03a9 : X\u03a9 \u2192 P1\u03a9 branched at {b1 , . . . , b2g+2 }. Also the curve X\u03a9 has genus g.\n\n3.2 The fibres of Hg,n\nWe now describe some properties of a G-Galois cover \u03c6 : X \u2192 P1 corresponding to a\npoint of Hg,n . In fact, the cover \u03c6 arises as the fibre product of n hyperelliptic covers\nwhich satisfy a strong disjointness condition on their branch loci.\nConsider an isomorphism \u03b9 : (Z/2)n \u2243 G. For i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}, this isomorphism determines a natural element si of order 2 in G. Let Hi \u2243 (Z/2)n\u22121 be the subgroup generated\nby all s j for j 6= i. Suppose for i \u2208 {1, . . ., n} that Bi is a non-empty finite subset of P1\nof even cardinality. For any non-empty S \u2282 {1, . . . , n}, denote by BS the set of all b \u2208 P1\nsuch that b \u2208 Bi for an odd number of i \u2208 S and denote by CS \u2192 P1 the hyperelliptic cover\nbranched at BS . Finally, let HS be the subgroup of G consisting of all elements \u2211ni=1 ai si\nsuch that \u2211i\u2208S ai is even. Note that each HS is non-canonically isomorphic to (Z/2)n\u22121 .\nFurthermore, when S = {i} we have BS = Bi and HS = Hi .\nLemma 3.2. Suppose \u03c6 : X \u2192 P1 is the normalized fibre product over P1 of n smooth\nhyperelliptic covers Ci \u2192 P1 with branch loci Bi . Then \u03c6 is a G-Galois cover and the\nquotient of X by HS is the hyperelliptic cover CS \u2192 P1 branched at BS .\nProof. The cover \u03c6 : X \u2192 P1 is a G-Galois cover of (possibly disconnected) smooth curves\nby the definition of the fibre product. Also by definition, Ci \u2192 P1 is the quotient of X by\nthe subgroup Hi .\nThe branch locus B of \u03c6 equals \u222ani=1 Bi . For b \u2208 B, the inertia group Ib of X \u2192 P1\nabove b must be cyclic; thus Ib \u2243 Z/2. In fact, the generator (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n ) of Ib satisfies\n\u03b1i = 1 if and only if b \u2208 Bi . To see this, note that if b \u2208 Bi , then Ci \u2192 P1 is branched at b\nand so Ib 6\u2282 Hi ; it follows that \u03b1i = 1 if b \u2208 Bi . On the other hand, if b 6\u2208 Bi , then Ci \u2192 P1\nis unramified at b and so Ib \u2282 Hi ; it follows that \u03b1i = 0 if b 6\u2208 Bi .\nSince HS \u2243 (Z/2)n\u22121 , the quotient X /HS \u2192 P1 is hyperelliptic; it remains to show\nthat the branch locus of this cover is BS . For b \u2208 B, the cover X /HS \u2192 P1 is branched\nat b if and only if Ib 6\u2282 HS , which is equivalent to (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n ) 6\u2208 HS . So X /HS \u2192 P1 is\nbranched at b if and only if \u03a3i\u2208S \u03b1i is odd. Now, \u03a3i\u2208S \u03b1i \u2261 #{i \u2208 S|b \u2208 Bi } mod 2, so this\nnumber is odd if and only if b \u2208 Bi for an odd number of i \u2208 S. Thus X /HS is branched at\nBS by definition.\n6\n\n\fIn Section 5, we construct covers \u03c6 : X \u2192 P1 corresponding to points of Hg,n for\nwhich X is also hyperelliptic. For example, when n = 2, suppose \u03c6 is the normalized fibre\nproduct of two hyperelliptic covers \u03c61 and \u03c62 . The curve X will also be hyperelliptic if\nits quotient C1,2 = X /H1,2 is isomorphic to P1 . This occurs when g1 = g2 and B1 and\nB2 overlap in all but one point; or when g2 = g1 + 1 and B1 \u2282 B2 . The other extreme\nis considered in [14] where Stepanov uses the fibre product of two hyperelliptic curves\nwhose branch loci intersect in a single point to construct Goppa codes.\nWe say that the collection {Bi }ni=1 is strongly disjoint if the following two conditions\nare satisfied: first, the sets BS are distinct for all non-empty S \u2282 {1, . . ., n}; second, B =\n\u222ani=1 Bi is a simple horizontal divisor. In other words, if b1 , b2 \u2208 B are two \u03a9-points of P1\u03a9\nfor some scheme \u03a9, then the second condition insures that either b1 = b2 or that b1 and\nb2 do not intersect in P1\u03a9 .\nLemma 3.3. A cover \u03c6 : X \u2192 P1 corresponds to a point of Hg,n if and only if X has\ngenus g and \u03c6 : X \u2192 P1 is isomorphic to the normalized fibre product over P1 of n smooth\nhyperelliptic covers Ci \u2192 P1 whose branch loci Bi form a strongly disjoint set.\nProof. If \u03c6 : X \u2192 P1 is the normalized fibre product of n hyperelliptic covers with branch\nloci Bi , then it is clear that \u03c6 is a G-Galois cover and X is projective. Furthermore, C j \u2192 P1\nis disjoint from the normalized fibre product of all Ci \u2192 P1 for i \u2264 j; otherwise, by Lemma\n3.2, C j \u2192 P1 would be isomorphic to CS \u2192 P1 for some { j} =\n6 S \u2282 {1, . . ., n}. This would\nimply BS = B j for some S 6= { j} which would contradict the fact that {Bi } form a strongly\ndisjoint set. Since these covers are disjoint over P1 , it follows that X is connected. Also X\nis a smooth relative curve since B = \u222ani=1 Bi is a simple horizontal divisor. By hypothesis,\nX has genus g and so \u03c6 corresponds to a point of Hg,n .\nConversely, if \u03c6 : X \u2192 P1 corresponds to a point of Hg,n , then X has genus g by\ndefinition. Consider the quotients Ci \u2192 P1k of \u03c6 by the subgroups Hi of G for i = 1, . . ., n.\nThese covers are clearly smooth and hyperelliptic. By the universal property of fibre\nproducts, there is a morphism from X to the normalized fibre product of the covers Ci \u2192\nP1 . This morphism must be an isomorphism since both X and the normalized fibre product\nhave degree 2n over P1 . Also, \u03c6 : X \u2192 P1 dominates the fibre product of any two of the\nquotients CS \u2192 P1 with branch locus BS , by Lemma 3.2. Since X is connected, these\nquotients CS \u2192 P1 must all be disjoint; in other words, the sets BS must all be distinct.\nAlso, \u222ani=1 Bi is the branch locus B of \u03c6; by definition, B is a simple horizontal divisor.\nThus {Bi } form a strongly disjoint set.\nCorollary 3.4. For n \u2265 2, the locus H g,n has dimension (g + 2n \u2212 1)/2n\u22122 \u2212 3 if g \u2261\n1 mod 2n\u22122 and is empty otherwise. In particular, the dimension of the locus H g,2 is g.\nProof. The dimension of Hg,n is equal to the dimension of (P1 )|B| , namely the number of\nbranch points |B| of the corresponding covers. By the Riemann-Hurwitz formula, |B| =\n(g + 2n \u2212 1)/2n\u22122 . By Lemma 3.1, the dimension of H g,n is three less than the dimension\nof Hg,n , which simplifies to g when n = 2.\n\n7\n\n\f3.3 Decomposition of the Jacobian\nWe will now describe the isogeny class of the Jacobian for any curve X for which there\nexists a cover \u03c6 : X \u2192 P1k corresponding to a k-point of Hg,n . For i \u2208 {1, . . ., n}, suppose\n\u03c6i : Ci \u2192 P1k is a smooth hyperelliptic cover with branch locus Bi . Suppose {Bi }ni=1 form\na strongly disjoint set and let B = \u222ani=1 Bi .\nProposition 3.5. Suppose \u03c6 : X \u2192 P1k is the normalization of the fibre product of \u03c6i for\ni = 1, . . . , n. Then Jac(X ) is isogenous to \u220f(Jac(CS )) where the product is taken over all\nnon-empty S \u2282 {1, . . ., n}.\nProof. Note that X /HS is the hyperelliptic curve CS by Lemma 3.2. Thus the result\nfollows directly from [8, Theorem C] if genus(X ) = \u03a3S genus(CS ). By the RiemannHurwitz formula, genus(CS ) = \u22121 + |BS |/2. Since B = \u222ani=1 Bi is the branch locus of\nX \u2192 P1k , it follows that genus(X ) = 2n\u22122 |B| \u2212 2n + 1. The proof follows by showing that\n\u03a3S |BS | = 2n\u22121 |B| by the inclusion-exclusion principle.\nThe isogeny between Jac(X ) and \u220f(Jac(CS )) is not sufficient to study the a-number\nof X since the a-number is not an isogeny invariant. For this reason, we now generalize\n1 (X ) also decomProposition 3.5 by showing that the de Rham cohomology group HdR\n1 (X )\nposes. Equivalently, one could work with the crystalline cohomology group Hcrys\nevaluated at k, [6, 1.3.6]. We thank Kani [7] for helping us with the proof of Proposition\n3.6. Let N = 2n \u2212 1.\n1 (X ) is isomorphic to \u2295 H 1 (C ) as\nProposition 3.6. Suppose char(k) 6= 2. Then HdR\nS dR S\nk[G]-modules, where the sum is taken over all non-empty S \u2282 {1, . . ., n}.\n\nProof. Since char(k) 6= 2, there exists an idempotent \u03b5S corresponding to the subgroup HS\nin the group ring k[G] for every nonempty subset S \u2282 {1, . . ., n}. Namely, \u03b5S = \u2211 h/2n\u22121 ,\nwhere the sum ranges over all h \u2208 HS . Let \u03b5G be the idempotent \u2211 h/2n, where the sum\n1 (C ) \u223c\nranges over all h \u2208 G. By Lemma 3.2, CS is the quotient of X by HS , so HdR\nS =\n1\nH\n1\n1\n1\n1\nG\n1\n\u223c\n\u223c\n\u223c\nS\n(HdR (X )) = \u03b5S HdR (X ). Furthermore, note that 0 = HdR (Pk ) = (HdR (X )) = \u03b5G HdR (X )\nand therefore that \u03b5G x = 0 for all x.\nIf S and T are distinct subsets then \u03b5S \u03b5T = 22\u22122n \u2211 hs ht where the sum ranges over all\nhs \u2208 HS and ht \u2208 HT . For each g \u2208 G, we see that gh\u22121\ns \u2208 HT for half of the values of\nhs \u2208 HS . So g appears 2n\u22122 times in \u2211 hs ht . Thus, 22n\u22122 \u03b5S \u03b5T = 2n\u22122 \u2211g\u2208G g and we obtain\nthat \u03b5S \u03b5T = \u03b5G . Similarly, one can show for all subsets S that \u03b5S \u03b5S = \u03b5S and \u03b5S \u03b5G = \u03b5G .\n1 (C ) to H 1 (X ):\nWe construct an explicit homomorphism \u03b3 from \u2295S HdR\nS\ndR\nN\n\n\u03b3(x1 , x2 , . . . , xN ) = \u2211 xi .\ni=1\n\n1 (X ) to \u2295 H 1 (C ) given by\nIf \u03c8 is the homomorphism from HdR\nS dR S\n\n\u03c8(y) = (\u03b51 y, \u03b52y, . . . , \u03b5N y)\n8\n\n\fthen one can check that \u03c8 \u25e6 \u03b3 = \u03b3 \u25e6 \u03c8 = Id. Thus \u03b3 is an isomorphism of k-vector spaces.\nIn fact, \u03b3 is a k[G]-module isomorphism since every g \u2208 G commutes with \u03b5S and thus\nwith \u03b3.\nThe following corollary will be used throughout the remainder of the paper.\nCorollary 3.7. Suppose char(k) > 2. There is an isomorphism between Jac(X )[p] and\n\u220fS (Jac(CS )[p]) as group schemes where the product is taken over all non-empty S \u2282\n{1, . . ., n}. In particular, Jac(X ) and \u220fS (Jac(CS )) have the same p-rank and a-number.\n1 (X )\nProof. By Proposition 3.6, there is an isomorphism of k-vector spaces between HdR\n1 (C ). By the functoriality of the Frobenius and Verschiebung morphisms, F\nand \u2295S HdR\nS\nand V commute with the action of g \u2208 G and thus with the idempotents \u03b5S . It follows\n1 (X ) and \u2295 H 1 (C ) are naturally isomorphic as k[V, F]-modules. Since X and\nthat HdR\nS dR S\n1 (Jac(X )) and \u2295 H 1 (Jac(C )) are isoCS are smooth curves, [5, 3.11.2] implies that HdR\nS dR\nS\n1 (Jac(X )) is canonically isomorphic to the\nmorphic as k[V, F]-modules. By [9, 5.11], HdR\n1 (Jac(C ))) is\ncontravariant Dieudonn\u00e9 module associated to Jac(X )[p]. Likewise, HdR\nS\ncanonically isomorphic to the contravariant Dieudonn\u00e9 module associated to Jac(CS )[p].\nSo the Dieudonn\u00e9 module of Jac(X )[p] is isomorphic to the direct sum of the Dieudonn\u00e9\nmodules of Jac(CS )[p]. It follows, from the equivalence of categories between finite commutative group schemes over k and their contravariant Dieudonn\u00e9 modules, that the group\nschemes Jac(X )[p] and \u220fS (Jac(CS )[p]) are isomorphic.\n\n4 Configurations of non-ordinary hyperelliptic curves\nThe results in this section will be used to find curves X having interesting p-power torsion,\nas measured in terms of invariants such as the p-rank and a-number. Corollary 3.7 shows\nthat when a cover \u03c6 : X \u2192 P1 corresponds to a point of Hg,n then such invariants for X can\nbe determined by the corresponding invariants of its Z/2-quotients. Since these quotients\nare all hyperelliptic, one can apply results of Yui [17]. The main difficulty is to control\nthe p-torsion of all of the curves CS in terms of the p-torsion of the curves Ci .\nLet C be a smooth hyperelliptic curve of genus g defined over an algebraically closed\nfield k of characteristic p > 2. Recall that C admits a Z/2-Galois cover \u03c61 : C \u2192 P1k with\n2g + 2 distinct branch points. Without loss of generality, we suppose \u03c61 is branched at \u221e\nand choose an equation for this cover of the form y2 = f (x), where f (x) is a polynomial\nof degree 2g + 1. We denote the roots of f (x) by {\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bb2g+1 }.\nDenote by cr the coefficient of xr in the expansion of f (x)(p\u22121)/2 . Then\n\u0013\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0012\n(p \u2212 1)/2 a1\n(p \u2212 1)/2\na2g+1\nr\u2212(p\u22121)/2\n\u03bb1 . . . \u03bb2g+1\n(1)\n...\ncr = (\u22121)\n\u2211\na2g+1\na1\nwhere the sum ranges over all 2g + 1-tuples (a1 , . . . , a2g+1 ) of integers such that 0 \u2264 ai \u2264\n(p \u2212 1)/2 for all i and \u2211 ai = (2g + 1)(p \u2212 1)/2 \u2212 r. Note that cr can be viewed as a\n9\n\n\fpolynomial in k[\u03bb1 , . . ., \u03bb2g+1 ] which is homogeneous of degree (2g + 1)(p \u2212 1)/2 \u2212 r\nand which is of degree (p \u2212 1)/2 in each variable.\nLet Ag be the g \u00d7 g matrix whose i jth entry is cip\u2212 j . The determinant of Ag defines\na polynomial in k[\u03bb1 , . . ., \u03bb2g+1 ] which we denote by Detg (\u03bb1 , . . ., \u03bb2g+1 ) = Detg (~\u03bb2g+1 ).\nThis polynomial is of degree at most g(p \u2212 1)/2 in each \u03bbi and is homogeneous of total\ndegree g2 (p \u2212 1)/2. It is invariant under the action of S2g+1 on the variables \u03bbi . We\ndenote by Dg \u2282 (A1k )2g+1 the hypersurface of points ~\u03bb2g+1 = (\u03bb1 , . . ., \u03bb2g+1 ) for which\nDetg (~\u03bb2g+1 ) = 0.\nIn [17], Yui gives the following characterization of non-ordinary hyperelliptic curves.\nRecall that \u2206 is the weak diagonal consisting of points with at least two equal coordinates.\nTheorem 4.1. (Yui [17]) Suppose C is a smooth hyperelliptic curve of genus g. Then C is\nnon-ordinary if and only if there is a Z/2-Galois cover \u03c6 : C \u2192 P1k branched at \u221e and at\n2g + 1 distinct points \u03bbi \u2208 A1k such that~\u03bb2g+1 \u2208 Dg .\nWe now find some results on the geometry of the hypersurface Dg which will be used\nin Sections 5 and 6 to construct curves in H g,n whose p-torsion has prescribed invariants. In Lemma 4.2 and Lemma 4.3, we show that Detg (~\u03bb2g+1 ) is generically a polynomial of degree d = g(p \u2212 1)/2 in the variable \u03bb2g+1 whose roots are not contained in\n{\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bb2g }. We expect for a generic choice of \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bb2g that this polynomial will have\nd distinct roots. Showing this seems to be related to the question of whether the hyperelliptic locus is transversal (in the strict geometric sense) to the locus Vg,g\u22121 of nonordinary\ncurves. So in Proposition 4.5, we instead prove the weaker statement that this polynomial\nhas at least (p \u2212 1)/2 distinct roots.\nLemma 4.2. The determinant Detg (~\u03bb2g+1 ) is a polynomial of degree d = g(p \u2212 1)/2 in\nthe variable \u03bb2g+1 .\nProof. As we observed above, the degree of Detg (~\u03bb2g+1 ) in \u03bb2g+1 is at most d. We claim\nthat the coefficient of \u03bbd2g+1 is a non-zero polynomial in k[\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bb2g ]. In particular, one\n2g\n\n(g\u2212\u2308i/2\u2309)(p\u22121)/2\n\nterm of this polynomial is (\u22121)g(p\u22121)/2 \u03bbd2g+1 \u220fi=1 \u03bbi\n.\nTo see this, we note first from Equation 1 that the total degree of cgp\u2212 j is (2g + 1)(p \u2212\n(p\u22121)/2\n1)/2 \u2212 (gp \u2212 j) = (p \u2212 1)/2 + ( j \u2212 g). So if j < g then \u03bb2g+1 cannot appear in cgp\u2212 j .\n(p\u22121)/2\n\nFurthermore, the coefficient of \u03bb2g+1\n\nin cgp\u2212g is exactly (\u22121)(p\u22121)/2 . Because the\ndegree of \u03bb2g+1 in cr is at most (p \u2212 1)/2 for all r, a monomial in Detg (~\u03bb2g+1 ) will be\ndivisible by \u03bbd2g+1 only if it is the product of matrix entries which are each divisible by\n(p\u22121)/2\n\n\u03bb2g+1\n\n. Thus cgp\u2212g is the only entry in the bottom row of Ag which contributes to the\nterms of Detg (~\u03bb2g+1 ) which are divisible by \u03bbd .\n2g+1\n\nSimilarly, in the penultimate row of Ag , the total degree of c(g\u22121)p\u2212 j will be 3(p \u2212\n1)/2 + ( j \u2212 (g \u2212 1)). Therefore, if j < g \u2212 1 then (\u03bb1 \u03bb2 \u03bb2g+1 )(p\u22121)/2 cannot divide\nc(g\u22121)p\u2212 j . Because the degree of \u03bb1 for all cr in Ag is at most (p \u2212 1)/2, only the last\n10\n\n\ftwo entries of the penultimate row contribute to the terms of Detg (~\u03bb2g+1 ) which are di(g\u22121)(p\u22121)/2\nvisible by \u03bb1\n. Also the coefficient of (\u03bb1 \u03bb2 \u03bb2g+1 )(p\u22121)/2 in c(g\u22121)p\u2212(g\u22121) is\n(\u22121)(p\u22121)/2 .\nContinuing, we see that only terms which are on or above the diagonal can contribute\nto the desired term of Detg (~\u03bb2g+1 ). It follows that the only term of Detg (~\u03bb2g+1 ) which\n2g (g\u2212\u2308i/2\u2309)(p\u22121)/2\ninvolves the monomial \u03bbd2g+1 \u220fi=1 \u03bbi\ncomes from the product of elements\nof the diagonal. The coefficient of this monomial is the product of g coefficients which\neach equal (\u22121)(p\u22121)/2 , so it is equal to (\u22121)g(p\u22121)/2 .\nLemma 4.3. The image of Detg (~\u03bb2g+1 ) in k[\u03bb1, . . . , \u03bb2g+1 ]/(\u03bb2g+1 \u2212 \u03bb1 ) is non-constant.\nProof. The proof is similar to that of Lemma 4.2. It is sufficient to show that at least one\nof the coefficients of Detg (\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bb2g , \u03bb1 ) is non-zero. The coefficient of the monomial\ng(p\u22121)/2 2g\n(g\u2212\u2308i/2\u2309)(p\u22121)/2\n\u03bb1\nis 2(\u22121)g(p\u22121)/2 as this monomial appears exactly twice\n\u220fi=1 \u03bbi\nas the product of terms in the diagonal of the Hasse-Witt matrix and does not appear again\nin the expansion of the determinant.\nSuppose exactly two branch points of a smooth hyperelliptic cover specialize together.\nThe resulting curve is singular and consists of a hyperelliptic curve C\u2032 of genus g \u2212 1 selfintersecting in a point. The geometric interpretation of the next lemma is that this singular\ncurve will be ordinary if and only if C\u2032 is ordinary.\nLemma 4.4. Detg (\u03bb1 , . . ., \u03bb2g\u22121 , 0, 0) = (\u2212\u03bb1 * * * \u03bb2g\u22121 )(p\u22121)/2 Detg\u22121 (\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bb2g\u22121 ).\nProof. Suppose \u03bb2g = \u03bb2g+1 = 0. Then the only nonzero terms in the sum defining cr\nare those where a2g = a2g+1 = 0. If r = p \u2212 1, then the only term in this sum that\ndoes not vanish is the one where ai = (p \u2212 1)/2 for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 2g \u2212 1. Thus c p\u22121 =\n(\u2212\u03bb1 * * * \u03bb2g\u22121 )(p\u22121)/2 . If r < p \u2212 1, then all of the terms in the sum are zero, and\nthus cr = 0. Suppose r > p \u2212 1 and r = ip \u2212 j. Then the term cr occuring in the ith\nrow and jth column of Ag equals the term cr\u2212(p\u22121) occuring in the (i \u2212 1)st row and\n( j \u2212 1)st column of Ag\u22121 . By expanding the determinant along the first row, we see that\nDetg (\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bb2g\u22121 , 0, 0) = c p\u22121 Det(Ag\u22121 ).\nFor fixed ~\u03bb2g = (\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bb2g ) \u2282 (A1k )2g , denote by L(~\u03bb2g ) the line consisting of points\n(\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bb2g , \u03bb2g+1 ) \u2282 (A1k )2g+1 (where only the last coordinate varies). Generically, the\nintersection of L(~\u03bb2g ) and Dg consists of d = g(p \u2212 1)/2 points when counted with\nmultiplicity. To see this, consider Det(~\u03bb2g+1 ) as a polynomial in R[\u03bb2g+1 ] where R =\nk[\u03bb1 , . . ., \u03bb2g ]. The coefficient of \u03bbd2g+1 in Det(~\u03bb2g+1 ) is non-zero in R by Lemma 4.2.\nSince k is an algebraically closed field, for any ~\u03bb2g = (\u03bb1, . . . , \u03bb2g ) not in the Zariski\nclosed set of (A1 )2g defined by this coefficient, Det(~\u03bb2g+1 ) has degree d and thus d roots\nk\n\nin k when counted with multiplicity. The next proposition gives a lower bound on the\nnumber of distinct roots.\n11\n\n\fProposition 4.5. Let Ug \u2282 (A1k )2g be the set of points (\u03bb1 , . . ., \u03bb2g ) for which L(~\u03bb2g ) intersects Dg in at least (p \u2212 1)/2 non-zero distinct points of (A1k )2g+1 \\\u2206. Then Ug is a\nnonempty Zariski open subset of (A1k )2g .\nProof. The proof is by induction on g. A result of Igusa [4] states that there are exactly (p \u2212 1)/2 distinct values \u03bb so that the elliptic curve branched at {0, 1, \u221e, \u03bb} is nonordinary. It follows that the result is true when g = 1.\nSuppose that Ug\u22121 is a nonempty Zariski open subset of (A1k )2g\u22122 . First we show\nthat for a generic choice of (\u03bb1 , . . ., \u03bb2g ) there are at least (p \u2212 1)/2 distinct choices of\n\u03bb2g+1 so that Detg (\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bb2g , \u03bb2g+1 ) = 0. It will suffice to construct a single choice of\n(\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bb2g ) for which this result holds, as the generic case will have at least as many\ndistinct roots as any specialized case. It follows from Lemma 4.4 that for non-zero\n\u03bb3 , . . . , \u03bb2g , the non-zero values of \u03bb2g+1 so that Detg (0, 0, \u03bb3, . . . , \u03bb2g , \u03bb2g+1 ) = 0 and\nDetg\u22121 (\u03bb3 , . . ., \u03bb2g+1 ) = 0 are the same. By the inductive hypothesis, for the generic\nchoice of (\u03bb3 , . . . , \u03bb2g ) there are at least (p \u2212 1)/2 non-zero distinct values of \u03bb2g+1 with\nthis property.\nNext we show that generically these (p \u2212 1)/2 intersection points of L(~\u03bb2g ) and Dg\nare not contained in \u2206. By Lemma 4.3 and by symmetry, for each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 2g, the value\n\u03bbi is a root of the polynomial Detg (\u03bb1 , . . ., \u03bb2g+1 ) \u2208 R[\u03bb2g+1 ] only when (\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bb2g ) is\nin a Zariski closed subset of (A1 )2g . So for the generic choice of (\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bb2g ), the root\n\u03bb2g+1 will not be contained in {\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bb2g }. It follows that for the generic choice of\n(\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bb2g ) the line L(~\u03bb2g ) intersects Dg in at least (p \u2212 1)/2 non-zero distinct points of\n(A1k )2g+1 \\\u2206. So Ug is a nonempty Zariski open subset of (A1k )2g .\nProposition 4.6. Let Ug \u2286 (A1k )2g be defined as in Proposition 4.5. Then we have that\nUg \u2229 (Dg\u22121 \u00d7 A1k ) has codimension 1 in (A1k )2g .\nProof. Since Dg\u22121 \u00d7 A1k has codimension 1 in (A1 )2g and Ug is open by Proposition 4.5,\nit is sufficient to show that no component V of Dg\u22121 \u00d7 A1k is contained in the complement\nWg of Ug. Note that the complement of Ug is a Zariski closed subset defined by equations\nwhich are each symmetric in the variables \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bb2g . On the other hand, any component\nV of Dg\u22121 \u00d7 A1k is defined by equations that do not involve \u03bb2g . Since the ideal of Wg is\nnot contained in the ideal of V , it follows that V is not contained in Wg .\n\n5 Curves with prescribed a-number\nWe now consider the a-number of Jacobians of curves with commuting involutions. Recall that the a-number, dimk Hom(\u03b1 p , Jac(X )), of a k-curve X is an integer between 0\nand g. Here \u03b1 p is the kernel of Frobenius on Ga . A generic curve is ordinary and thus\nhas a-number equal to zero. A supersingular elliptic curve E has a-number equal to one\nand in this case there is a non-split exact sequence 0 \u2192 \u03b1 p \u2192 E[p] \u2192 \u03b1 p \u2192 0. There\nis a unique isomorphism type of group scheme for the p-torsion of a supersingular elliptic curve, which we denote M. In this section we construct curves X so that Jac(X )[p]\ncontains multiple copies of the group scheme M and thus has large a-number.\n12\n\n\fLet Tg,a denote the sublocus of M g consisting of curves of genus g with a-number at\nleast a. The codimension of Tg,a in M g is at least a since Tg,a \u2282 Vg,g\u2212a . It is not known\nwhether (for all g and all 0 \u2264 a \u2264 g) there exists a curve of genus g with a-number equal\nto a. The results in this section give some evidence for a positive answer to this question.\nWe note that these results can be viewed as a generalization of [11, Section 5]. In\nthat paper, Oort considers curves X of genus g = 3 with a group action by G = (Z/2)2\nso that the three Z/2-quotients of X are all elliptic curves. He shows that there exist\n(nonhyperelliptic) curves of genus 3 with a-number 3 for all primes p \u2265 3 as well as\nhyperelliptic supersingular curves of genus 3 with a-number 3 for all p \u2261 3 mod 4.\nLemma 5.1. The generic geometric point of the hyperelliptic locus H g has a-number\nequal to 0. The non-ordinary locus has codimension one in H g and its generic geometric\npoint has a-number 1 and p-rank g \u2212 1.\nProof. This is immediate from Theorem 2.3 and the fact that a curve with p-rank g \u2212 1\nhas a-number 1.\nThe next theorem will lead immediately to Corollary 5.3 which is the main result in\nthis paper on the a-number of curves.\nTheorem 5.2. Suppose n \u2265 2 and p \u2265 2n + 1. Suppose g is such that g \u2261 1 mod 2n\u22122 and\ng \u2265 (n \u2212 1)2n\u22122 + 1. There exists a family of smooth curves X of genus g of dimension at\nleast (g + 2n \u2212 1)/2n\u22122 \u2212 3 \u2212 n so that Jac(X )[p] contains the group scheme M n .\nFor the proof of Theorem 5.2, we will construct a fibre product \u03c6 : X \u2192 P1 of n\nhyperelliptic covers \u03c6i so that the disjoint union of any two of the branch loci Bi will\nconsist of exactly two points. It follows that the curves Ci, j will have genus zero.\nProof. Write g = 1 + l2n\u22122 . If l 6\u2261 n mod 2, let g1 = (l + 3 \u2212 n)/2. Note that g1 \u2265 1. By\nProposition 4.5 and Lemma 5.1, as long as n \u2264 (p \u2212 1)/2, there is a Zariski open subset\nUg1 of (A1k )2g1 with the following property: there are at least n choices \u03b71 , . . ., \u03b7n for\n\u03bb2g1 +1 such that the corresponding hyperelliptic curve Ci is non-ordinary. By Theorem\n2.3, after replacing Ug1 with a smaller Zariski open subset of (A1k )2g1 , we can further\nsuppose that the curves C1 , . . . ,Cn will have p-rank g1 \u2212 1. Thus Jac(Ci )[p] contains M.\nLet \u03c6i : Ci \u2192 P1 for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n be the hyperelliptic Ug1 -curves corresponding to these\nchoices. Let \u03c6 : X \u2192 P1 be the normalization of the fibre product of the covers \u03c6i .\nNote that X is branched at B = {\u221e, \u03bb1 , . . ., \u03bb2g1 , \u03b71 , . . . , \u03b7n }. By Proposition 3.5, the\ngenus of X will be 2n\u22122 (2g1 + 1 + n) \u2212 2n + 1 = g. By Corollary 3.7, Jac(X )[p] contains \u2295ni=1 Jac(Ci )[p] which contains \u2295ni=1 M. The dimension of this family of curves is\n2g1 \u2212 2 = |B| \u2212 3 \u2212 n which equals (g + 2n \u2212 1)/2n\u22122 \u2212 3 \u2212 n. Note that the p-rank of X\nis at least n(g1 \u2212 1).\nAlternatively, if l \u2261 n mod 2, let g1 = (l + 2 \u2212 n)/2 and note g1 \u2265 1. By Proposition\n4.6, the locus Ug1 +1 \u2229 (Dg1 \u00d7 A1l ) has codimension 1 in (A1k )2g1 +2 . In other words, as long\nas n \u2264 1 + (p \u2212 1)/2, for any (\u03bb1, . . . , \u03bb2g1 +2 ) in a codimension 1 subset Z of (A1k )2g1 +2 ,\nit is true that (\u03bb1 , . . ., \u03bb2g1 +1 ) \u2208 Dg1 and there are at least n \u2212 1 choices \u03b7i of \u03bb2g1 +3\n13\n\n\fwith (\u03bb1 , . . ., \u03bb2g1 +3 ) \u2208 Dg1 +1 . Let \u03c6n : Cn \u2192 P1 be the hyperelliptic cover branched at\n(\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bb2g1 +1 ). For 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1, let \u03c6i : Ci \u2192 P1 be the hyperelliptic cover branched at\n(\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bb2g1 +2 , \u03b7i ). Then Cn has genus g1 and Ci has genus g1 + 1 for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1. By\nTheorem 2.3, after restricting to a Zariski open subset of Z, we can further suppose that\nCn (resp. Ci ) has p-rank g1 \u2212 1 (resp. g1 ). Thus Jac(Ci )[p] contains M for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n.\nLet \u03c6 : X \u2192 P1 be the normalization of the fibre product of \u03c6i for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. Note that\n\u03c6 is branched at B = {\u221e, \u03bb1 , . . ., \u03bb2g1 +2 , \u03b71 , . . . , \u03b7n\u22121 }. As above, X has genus 2n\u22122 (2g1 +\n2 + n) \u2212 2n + 1 = g and Jac(X )[p] contains M n . By Proposition 4.6, the locus Z has\ndimension 2g1 + 1. The corresponding family of curves has dimension 2g1 \u2212 1 = |B| \u2212\n3 \u2212 n which again equals (g + 2n \u2212 1)/2n\u22122 \u2212 3 \u2212 n. Note that the p-rank of X is at least\nng1 \u2212 1.\nCorollary 5.3. Suppose n \u2265 2 and p \u2265 2n + 1. Suppose g is such that H g,n is non-empty\nof dimension at least n + 1. Then the intersection H g,n \u2229 Tg,n has codimension at most n\nin H g,n . In particular, there exists a smooth curve of genus g with a-number at least n.\nProof. By Corollary 3.4, the condition that H g,n is non-empty is equivalent to g \u2261 1 mod\n2n\u22122 and the condition that H g,n has dimension at least n + 1 is equivalent to g \u2265 (n \u2212\n1)2n\u22122 + 1. The family constructed in Theorem 5.2 has dimension (g + 2n \u2212 1)/2n\u22122 \u2212\n3 \u2212 n and thus codimension n in H g,n . For any fibre X in this family, Jac(X )[p] contains\nM n and so X has a-number at least n. So this family is contained in H g,n \u2229 Tg,n .\nWhen n = 2 or n = 3, then the curves found in Theorem 5.2 are in fact hyperelliptic.\nCorollary 5.4. Suppose g \u2265 2 and p \u2265 5. There exists a (g \u2212 2)-dimensional family of\nsmooth hyperelliptic curves of genus g whose fibres have a-number 2 and p-rank g \u2212 2.\nThe family in Corollary 5.4 has codimension 2 in H g,2 .\nProof. This follows immediately from Theorem 5.3 once we show that the curve X is\nhyperelliptic when n = 2. If g is even, note that the branch loci of \u03c61 and \u03c62 differ in\nonly one point. The third quotient C1,2 of X by Z/2 is branched at only two points \u03b71 and\n\u03b72 . So the cover X \u2192 C1,2 is hyperelliptic. Likewise, if g is odd, then the third quotient\nC1,2 of X by Z/2 is branched at only two points \u03bb2g1 +2 and \u03b71 so the cover X \u2192 C1,2 is\nhyperelliptic. In both cases, Jac(X )[p] \u2243 Jac(C1 )[p] \u2295 Jac(C2 )[p] and so the fibres of X\nhave a-number 2 and p-rank g \u2212 2.\nCorollary 5.5. Suppose g \u2265 5 is odd and p \u2265 7. There exists a (g \u2212 5)/2-dimensional\nfamily of smooth hyperelliptic curves X of genus g so that Jac(X )[p] contains M 3 and thus\nhas a-number at least 3.\nThe family in Corollary 5.5 has codimension 3 in H g,3 .\nProof. It is sufficient to show that the fibres of the family constructed in Theorem 5.3 are\nhyperelliptic when n = 3. In both cases of the construction, if S = {1, 2}, {1, 3}, or {2, 3},\nthen the quotient CS \u2192 P1 of X by HS \u2243 (Z/2)2 is branched at only two points and so\n14\n\n\fCS has genus 0. Consider the quotient X \u2032 of X by the subgroup H \u2032 \u2243 Z/2 generated by\nh = (1, 1, 1). Note that X \u2032 dominates CS if S = {1, 2}, {1, 3}, or {2, 3}, since h \u2208 HS . It\nfollows that X \u2032 has genus zero since X \u2032 \u2192 P1 is a (Z/2)2 -cover having three Z/2-quotients\nof genus zero. It follows that X \u2192 X \u2032 is hyperelliptic.\nRemark 5.6. One would like to strengthen Corollary 5.5 by producing curves with anumber exactly 3. The difficulty is to determine the a-number of C{1,2,3} . For example,\nto construct a curve of genus g = 5 and a-number exactly 3 with this method, one would\nneed to guarantee that there are supersingular values \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 and \u03bb3 so that the hyperelliptic\ncurve of genus two branched at {0, 1, \u221e, \u03bb1, \u03bb2 , \u03bb3 } is ordinary.\nRemark 5.7. In the above results, some restriction on p is unavoidable. By Proposition\n3.1 of [13], there does not exist a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2 and a-number 2 when\np = 3 or of genus 3 and a-number 3 when p = 3 or 5. Also, there does not exist a\nhyperelliptic curve with a-number 4 when g = 4 and p = 3, 5 or when g = 5 and p = 3.\nWe now produce curves of every genus with a-number at least 4 using this method.\n(One can also produce curves of every genus with a-number at least 3 and count the\ndimension of these families). The curves constructed in this way will most likely not be\nhyperelliptic. This makes it difficult to produce a curve of every genus with every possible\na-number using induction and fibre products.\nCorollary 5.8. Suppose g \u2265 7 and p \u2265 5. There exists a curve of genus g with a-number\nat least 4.\nProof. If g is even, let g1 = g/2. Note that g1 \u2212 2 \u2265 2. From Corollary 5.4, there exists a\nhyperelliptic curve of genus g1 \u2212 2 and a-number 2. Consider the corresponding hyperelliptic cover \u03c61 branched at {\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bb2g1 \u22123 , \u221e}. Consider a hyperelliptic cover \u03c62 branched\nat {\u03b71 , . . ., \u03b75 , \u221e} which has a-number 2. After modifying \u03c62 by an affine linear transformation, one can suppose that {\u03b7i } \u2229 {\u03bbi } is empty. The cardinality of (B1 \u222a B2 )\\(B1 \u2229 B2 )\nis (2g1 \u2212 2) + 6 \u2212 2 = 2g1 + 2. It follows from Proposition 3.5 that the fiber product of \u03c61\nand \u03c62 yields a curve with genus (g1 \u2212 2) + g1 + 2 = g and a-number at least 4.\nIf g is odd, let g1 = (g\u22121)/2. Note that g1 \u22121 \u2265 2. By Corollary 5.4, there exists a hyperelliptic curve of genus g1 \u2212 1 and a-number 2. Consider the corresponding hyperelliptic cover \u03c61 branched at {\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bb2g1 \u22122 , 0, \u221e}. Consider a hyperelliptic cover \u03c62 branched\nat {\u03b71 , . . ., \u03b74 , 0, \u221e} which has a-number 2. After modifying \u03c62 by a scalar transformation, one can suppose that {\u03b7i } \u2229 {\u03bbi } is empty. The cardinality of (B1 \u222a B2 )\\(B1 \u2229 B2 ) is\n2g1 + 6 \u2212 4 = 2g1 + 2. It follows from Proposition 3.5 that the fiber product of \u03c61 and \u03c62\nyields a curve with genus (g1 \u2212 1) + g1 + 2 = g and a-number at least 4.\n\n6 Curves with prescribed p-torsion\nThe methods of the previous sections can also be used to construct Jacobians whose ptorsion contains group schemes other than \u03bc p or \u03b1 p . In this section, we illustrate this for\n15\n\n\ftwo particular isomorphism types of group scheme, namely the p-torsion of a supersingular abelian surface which is not superspecial and of a supersingular abelian variety of\ndimension 3 with a-number 1.\nSection 3 allows one to describe the p-torsion of the Jacobian of a curve X which\ncorresponds to a point of H g,n . Specifically, Proposition 3.6 states that Jac(X )[p] is the\ndirect sum of Jac(CS )[p] where CS is the quotient of X by HS and S ranges over the\n2n \u2212 1 nonempty subsets of {1, . . ., n}. With this method, it is only possible to construct\nJacobians so that Jac(X )[p] is decomposable into (at least two) group schemes each of\nwhich occurs as the p-torsion of a hyperelliptic curve.\nVia the p-rank, we have already considered the group scheme for the p-torsion of an\nordinary elliptic curve, namely Z/p \u2295 \u03bc p . Using the a-number, we have already studied\nthe group scheme M of the p-torsion of a supersingular elliptic curve.\nNot many other group schemes are known to occur as the p-torsion of a hyperelliptic\ncurve. There are four possibilities of group scheme which occur among curves of genus 2\n(which are automatically hyperelliptic). The first three (Z p \u2295 \u03bc p )2 , (Z/p \u2295 \u03bc p ) \u2295 M, and\nM 2 are decomposable. We will focus on the most interesting of the four, namely the group\nscheme N for the p-torsion of a supersingular abelian surface which is not superspecial.\nA curve X with Jac(X )[p] \u2243 N has genus 2 and is thus hyperelliptic.\nBy [3, Example A.3.15], there is a filtration H1 \u2282 H2 \u2282 N where H1 \u2243 \u03b1 p , H2 /H1 \u2243\n\u03b1 p \u2295 \u03b1 p and N/H2 \u2243 \u03b1 p . Moreover, the kernel G1 of Frobenius and the kernel G2 of\nVerschiebung are contained in H2 and there is an exact sequence 0 \u2192 H1 \u2192 G1 \u2295 G2 \u2192\nH2 \u2192 0.\nThe group scheme N is perhaps easier to describe in terms of its covariant Dieudonn\u00e9\nmodule. Consider the non-commutative ring E = W (k)[F,V ] with the Frobenius automorphism \u03c3 : W (k) \u2192 W (k) and the relations FV = V F = p and F\u03bb = \u03bb\u03c3F and \u03bbV = V \u03bb\u03c3\nfor all \u03bb \u2208 W (k). Recall that there is an equivalence of categories between finite commutative group schemes G over k (with order pr ) and finite left E-modules D(G) (having length r as a W (k)-module), see for example [3, A.5]. By [3, Example A.5.1-5.4],\nD(\u03bc p ) = k/k(V, 1 \u2212 F), D(\u03b1 p ) = k/k(F,V ), and D(N) = k/k(F 3 ,V 3 , F 2 \u2212V 2 ).\nThe p-rank of a curve X with Jac(X )[p] \u2243 N is zero. To see this, note that Hom(\u03bc p , N) =\n0 or that F and V are both nilpotent on D(N). The a-number of a curve X with Jac(X )[p] \u2243\nN is one. (It is at least one since the p-rank is 0 and at most one since the abelian surface\nis not superspecial.) This also follows from the structure of the group scheme or from the\nfact that N[F] \u2229 N[V ] = H1 \u2243 \u03b1 p .\nLemma 6.1. There is a one-dimensional family of smooth curves X of genus two with\nJac(X )[p] \u2243 N.\nProof. The dimension in A 2 of supersingular (resp. superspecial) abelian surfaces is one\n(resp. zero). It follows that the locus of abelian surfaces with p-torsion N is exactly one.\nThe generic point of this one-dimensional family must be in the image of the Torelli\nmorphism since M 2 and A 2 have the same dimension. So there is a one-dimensional\nfamily of curves of genus two with p-rank 0 and a-number 1. The fibres of this family\n16\n\n\fare all smooth since the family cannot intersect either of the boundary components \u22060 or\n\u22061 .\nLemma 6.2. There exists a one-dimensional family of smooth hyperelliptic curves X of\ngenus 3 with Jac(X )[p] \u2243 N \u2295 (Z/p \u2295 \u03bc p ).\nProof. By Lemma 6.1, there is a one-dimensional family of smooth curves X of genus\ntwo with Jac(X )[p] \u2243 N. This yields a family of hyperelliptic covers of P1 branched at\nsix points. For some subset of four of these points, the family of elliptic curves branched\nat these points must have varying j-invariant and so its fibres are generically ordinary.\nThe fibre product of these two families of covers yields a family of smooth hyperelliptic\ncurves of genus 3 with p-torsion N \u2295 (Z/p \u2295 \u03bc p ) by Corollary 3.7.\nThe following proposition will be used to generalize Lemma 6.2 for g \u2265 4.\nProposition 6.3. Suppose there exists an r-dimensional family of smooth hyperelliptic\ncurves C of genus g\u2032 with Jac(C)[p] \u2243 G for some group scheme G. Suppose s \u2265 1 and\ng = 2g\u2032 \u2212 1 + s. Then there exists an (r + s)-dimensional family of smooth curves X in\nH g,2 so that Jac(X )[p] contains G.\nProof. For each curve C in the original family with Jac(C)[p] \u2243 G and branch locus\nB0 = {\u03bb1 , . . ., \u03bb2g\u2032 +2 }, we will construct an s-dimensional family of smooth curves X so\nthat Jac(X )[p] contains G. By Proposition 3.5 and Lemma 3.7, it will suffice to construct\nhyperelliptic curves C1 and C2 whose branch loci B1 and B2 are of even cardinality with\n|B1 \u2229 B2 | = s and B0 = (B1 \u222a B2 )\\(B1 \u2229 B2 ).\nIf s = 2m is even, then B1 = B0 \u222a {\u03b71 , . . . , \u03b72m } and B2 = {\u03b71 , . . ., \u03b72m } satisfy these\nrestrictions and there are 2m = s choices for the points \u03b7i . Similarly, if s = 2m + 1 is odd,\nthen we can set B1 = {\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bb2g\u2032 +1 , \u03b71 , . . . , \u03b72m+1 } and B2 = {\u03bb2g\u2032 +2 , \u03b71 , . . . , \u03b72m+1 }\nsatisfy these restrictions. There are 2m + 1 = s choices for \u03b7i . The Jacobian of the normalized fibre product X of C1 and C2 contains Jac(C).\nThis is the main result of the section.\nCorollary 6.4. Let N be the p-torsion of a supersingular abelian surface which is not\nsuperspecial. For all g \u2265 2, there exists a smooth hyperelliptic curve X so that Jac(X )[p]\ncontains N.\nProof. The statement will follow from induction. Assume for all g\u2032 such that 2n \u2264 g\u2032 <\n2n+1 that there exists a smooth hyperelliptic curve Xg\u2032 so that Jac(Xg\u2032 )[p] contains N. This\nis true for n = 1 by Lemma 6.1 and Lemma 6.2. If 2n+1 \u2264 g < 2n+2 , then g = 2g\u2032 or\ng = 2g\u2032 + 1 for some g\u2032 such that 2n \u2264 g\u2032 < 2n+1 . Using Proposition 6.3 with s = 1 or\ns = 2 allows one to construct a curve Xg of genus g so that Jac(Xg)[p] contains N. If\ns = 1 or s = 2 in Proposition 6.3, then B2 consists of exactly two points so Xg is also\nhyperelliptic.\n\n17\n\n\fSimilarly, one can consider the group scheme Q of the p-torsion of a supersingular\nabelian variety of dimension three with a-number 1. A curve X with Jac(X )[p] = Q has\np-rank 0. Also, D(Q) = k[F,V ]/k(F 4 ,V 4 , F 3 \u2212 V 3 ). The restriction on g in the next\ncorollary could be removed if there exists a smooth hyperelliptic curve X of genus 4 so\nthat Jac(X )[p] contains Q.\nCorollary 6.5. Let Q be the p-torsion of a supersingular abelian variety of dimension\nthree with a-number 1. Suppose g \u2265 3 is not a power of two. Then there exists a smooth\nhyperelliptic curve X of genus g so that Jac(X )[p] contains Q.\nProof. The proof parallels that of Corollary 6.4. One starts with the supersingular hyperelliptic curve X of genus 3 and a-number 1 (and thus Jac(X )[p] \u2243 Q) from [11] and works\ninductively using Proposition 6.3.\nIt is natural to ask whether Corollary 6.4 could be strengthened to state that Jac(X )[p] \u2243\nN \u2295 (Z/p \u2295 \u03bc p )g\u22122 . This raises the following geometric question.\nQuestion 6.6. Given any choice of \u039b = {\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bb2r }, does there exist \u03bc \u2208 A1k \u2212 \u039b so that\nthe hyperelliptic curve branched at {\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bb2r , \u03bc, \u221e} is ordinary?\nFor a generic choice of \u039b, the answer to Question 6.6 is yes by Lemma 4.2. This\nquestion will have an affirmative answer if the hypersurface Dr does not contain any\ncoordinate line L(~\u03bb2r ). The question is equivalent to asking whether, given a hyperelliptic\ncover \u03c6 : X \u2192 P1k , it is always possible to deform X to an ordinary curve by moving only\none branch point.\nAn affirmative answer to Question 6.6 would allow one to strengthen Proposition\n\u2032\n6.3 to state that Jac(X )[p] \u2243 G \u2295 (Z/p \u2295 \u03bc p)g \u22121+s . This is because the curves C1 and\nC2 in the proof can be generically chosen to be ordinary. So an affirmative answer to\nQuestion 6.6 would imply that for all g \u2265 4 there exists a smooth hyperelliptic curve X\nwith Jac(X )[p] \u2243 N \u2295 (Z/p \u2295 \u03bc p )g\u22122 . If this is true, then Jac(X )[p] \u2243 N \u2295 (Z/p \u2295 \u03bc p )g\u22122\nwhen X is the generic geometric point of H g \u2229Vg,g\u22122 .\n\nReferences\n[1] C. Faber and G. van der Geer.
