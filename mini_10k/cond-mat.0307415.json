After equilibrium conditions are achieved, disrupted sp3 bonds may reconstruct as the more stable sp2 bonds. The passage of swift\nions through matter causes severe bond breakage, which\nis generally referred to as a \"thermal-spike\" that accompanies the stopping of the ion in matter. For the case\nof diamond, the local bond disruption of the sp3 bonds,\nand subsequent reconstruction upon equilibration, may\nresult in the formation of an sp2 rich region along the\nion-track. Indeed, the passage of MeV or GeV heavy ions\nthrough diamond-like (sp3 rich) layers has been shown\nby high resolution AFM and STM scans to result in local graphitization1 . This is evidenced by the formation\nof protrusions at the ion-impact points (swelling) and by\nthe formation of electrically conductive channels. Both\nthese factors indicate that the preferred sp2 bonding has\noccurred along the pathways of the ions, in the otherwise sp3 rich material2 . The width of the transformed\nmaterial, due to the impact of GeV Au ions, has been\ndeduced from the data an was found to be of the order\nof 85 nm. Fig. 1 illustrates the material transformation\n(density and electrical conductivity) measured by atomic\nforce and scanning tunneling microscopy.\nThe damage inflicted on diamond by sub-MeV ionimplantation is known to result in electrical conductive\nregions along the ion track and around the stopping\npoints of the ions3 . The nature of these conductive regions, which have been shown to give rise to hopping\nconductivity, is controversial. Prins postulates that they\nmainly contain a mixture of vacancies and interstitial C\natoms which eventually collapse to from vacancy clus-\n\nFIG. 1: Surface morphology (left) and local electrical conductivity (right) of the transformed diamond-like amorphous\ncarbon due to ion impact (taken from ref.2 ).\n\nters ('vacloids')4 . On the other hand, Prawer and Kalish\nhave concluded, based on measurements of the dependence of the conductivity of damaged diamond on iondamage-implantation dose that the ion-affected diamond\nis highly conductive due to the formation of graphite-like\nregions along the ion-tracks5.\nComputer simulations of the damage in diamond\ncaused by the energetic displacement of a few C atoms\nresulting in damage to a small volume in diamond6 (of\n1.4 nm3 ) show that the size and nature of these regions\ndepend on the initial recoil energy imparted to the C\natoms and on the sample temperature. In some cases\nthe formation of clusters of sp2 bonded C atoms forming\na six-fold rings has been observed in these simulations.\nIn the present study we simulate the passage of a swift\nion through a diamond or a diamond-like tetrahedrally\nbonded amorphous C layer (ta \u2212 C) by locally \"heating\"\na section of the sample up to very high temperatures\n(comparable to the temperatures expected to prevail in\nthe thermal spike). We compute the sp2 and sp3 fractions in the affected volume and follow their evolution\n\n\f2\nas a function of cooling rate and time. We find that,\nupon cooling, a region which contains both sp2 and sp3\nbonded C forms along the track. The nature of the material in this regrown region depends on the initial heating\nof the track and on its cooling rate. Under some conditions, complete regrowth back to perfect diamond is\nfound, whereas in other cases, a sp2 rich region remains\nalong the ion track. Similar results are found when a\nthermal spike is simulated in amorphous carbon which\nis then allowed to cool down under a range of different\nconditions. The relevance of these computational results,\nobviously limited to small samples and to relatively short\ncooling times, to the actual ion passage through C based\nmaterials is discussed.\nWe start below by briefly reviewing the physical processes involved in the formation of the thermal spike and\nthe typical parameters of such a spike initiated in diamond by the passage of a swift heavy ion; we then\ndescribe the computations performed, discuss their relevance to ion-implantation experiments; present and discuss our results.\n\nII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe \"thermal spike\" which accompanies the passage\nof an ion through matter can be viewed as a short-time\nlocal melting of the ion damaged region followed by a\nrapid cooling. Quenching from the liquid phase has been\nwidely used to create amorphous materials (including\namorphous carbon) in computer simulations, using empirical potentials7 , ab initio8\u201310 and tight-binding molecular dynamics11\u201313 . It has been shown that such a procedure produces an amorphous carbon similar to material\nproduced experimentally by the deposition of a carbon\nfilm either by evaporation in an electron beam, by carbon arc14\u201316 or by ion beam deposition with ion energies\nbetween several ten and several hundred eV17\u201319 .\nIn contrast to this large body of computer simulations\nof amorphous carbon, there have been only a few simulations of the material resulting from damaging diamond\nby ion-implantation. Specific simulations of damage in\nmaterial induced by ion implantation can be divided into\ntwo categories: (i) the commonly used TRIM code20,21\nand (ii) the Molecular Dynamics (MD) technique22 . The\nTRIM (TRansport of Ions in Matter) code is a Monte\nCarlo program that calculates the trajectories of the primary ion and of the recoiling host atoms involved in the\nirradiation event. The required input parameters are\nthe ion type and energy and the properties of the host\nmaterial i.e. its composition, density, and the displacement energy of the constituent atoms. TRIM provides\ngood estimates of the damage and of the implant distributions and it is widely used in planning the dopant\nprofile in ion-implantation experiments. However, TRIM\ncannot account for the structure of the material (amorphous vs. crystalline) nor model the dynamic annealing\nof the implantation affected material. In particular, it\n\ncannot predict the nature of the defects in diamond because of the variety of possible bonding configurations of\ncarbon that may induce the diamond to graphite transition. A modification of TRIM has recently been developed by Sha'anan21 which enables following the evolution, in space and time, of the damage cascade caused by\nthe passage of a single ion through matter. The results of\nthe application of this code to simulate the passage of an\n1MeV Xe ion through diamond show that extremely high\ntemperatures (of the order of many tens of thousand of\ndegrees) are induced during very short times (less than 1\nps) along the ion track. As we will discuss below, these\nresemble the time/temperature regime modeled in our\ncomputations of the damage inflicted on diamond and\nta \u2212 C by heavy ion irradiation.\nAn MD study of radiation damage caused by the passage of a single carbon atom through diamond was performed by Wu and Fahy23 , using the Tersoff potential.\nIn that study the computations were restricted to the investigation of the damage threshold energy necessary to\ndisplace a single C atom from its lattice site. Smith24\nsimulated the results of the bombardment of diamond\nusing a similar computational method but limiting the\nanalysis to the ejection mechanisms of C atoms from a\ndiamond surface (carbon self-sputtering). Marks et. al.25\nhave investigated the growth of a\u2212 C layers. By computing the mean square displacement of the atoms during the\ncooling of the melt and the time required for it to relax,\nthe life-time of the thermal spike in diamond was found\nto be less than 1 picosecond, for ion impacts below 400\neV. In these latter study ab initio MD techniques were\nused.\nSaada et al6 carried out MD simulations, using the\nTersoff potential, of a damage region embedded inside a\ndiamond matrix created by the energetic displacement of\ncarbon atoms with a kinetic energy of up to 416 eV (8\ntimes the displacement energy of carbon atoms in diamond) in the bulk of a diamond crystal. Such regions\nare likely to appear in diamond at the final stages of the\nimplantation-related damage cascade. The conclusion of\nthat study was that partial amorphization of a volume\nwith a radius of 1-2 nm occurs around the stopping point\nof the recoiling ion. With an increasing number of successively displaced atoms, the damage volume and the\nnumber of threefold coordinated atoms was found to increase. The structure of the damaged regions (i.e. the\nratio of sp2 and sp3 bonded C atoms) was found in ref.6\nto depend on the sample temperature.\nThese computer studies strengthen our understanding\nof the processes occurring inside or at the end of an 'ion\ntrack' in diamond. However, the transitions from sp3\nto sp2 bonds within thermal spike regions have not yet\nbeen investigated in detail. The purpose of the present\nstudy is to investigate transformations of diamond and\ndiamond-like amorphous carbon under the extreme conditions which prevail during and after the passage of a\nheavy fast ion through the materials.\n\n\f3\nIII.\n\nTIGHT-BINDING SIMULATION DETAILS\nA.\n\nGeneral description of the calculations\n\nWe present a simulations of the thermal spike which\noccurs during the passage of a heavy fast ion through either diamond or amorphous carbon by locally heating\na slab of the material to very high temperatures and\nallowing it to rapidly cool down. A large increase in\nvolume accompanies the sp3 - to sp2 bond conversion26,\nbut the volume of the damaged region in the center of\nthe diamond is restricted by the surrounding diamond\n(or amorphous carbon) lattice, therefore simulations are\ncarried out under constant volume conditions. In order\nto set the temperature, a randomly directed velocity is\nassigned to each atom. The value of the velocity is randomly selected in accordance with a Maxwell distribution for the desired temperature. The velocities can be\nrescaled to be related to the ambient temperatures. Periodic boundary conditions are applied to the samples in\nall three directions. In order to describe the interactions\nbetween carbon atoms we use a tight- binding model27 ,\nwhich has been shown to be transferable to successfully\nsimulate different carbon polytypes: diamond, graphite,\nfullerenes28 as well as disordered carbon structures such\nas liquid and amorphous carbon phases11,12 . The MD\nstep was 0.5 \u00d7 10\u221215 s.\nThe method used here to distinguish between sp3 and\nsp2 bonded atoms is based on determination of the coordination number of each atom. The radial distribution\nfunction (RDF) of all carbon samples exhibits a clear gap,\ncentered at about 0.19 nm, separating the first and the\nsecond peak corresponding to the first and second neighbor shells. All atoms within the sphere of radius 0.19 nm\nare thus assumed to comprise the nearest neighborhood\nof a given atom. Therefore, the number of neighbors\nof each atom within a distance of 0.19 nm determines\nthe coordination number. Atoms that have four nearest neighbors within this sphere are assumed to be sp3\nbonded, while atoms which have only three are assumed\nto be sp2 bonded.\nThe Atomic Visualization package (AViz)29 was used\nextensively in all stages of this project. A visualization of\nour carbon samples with color coding for different atomic\nbonding helped indentify clusters of either sp2 or sp3 coordinated atoms, rings, graphite-like planes. Color pictures of the results of the present study can be found on\nthe web site30 .\nB.\n\nFIG. 2: Initial configuration of the samples; grey (purple)\nballs represent the frozen atoms, white (yellow) balls represent\natoms that are free to move. (Purple and yellow are shown\nonline)\n\natoms), 2 \u00d7 2\u00d7 8 (256 atoms), 2 \u00d7 3\u00d7 6 (288 atoms)\nand 3 \u00d7 3\u00d7 6 (432 atoms) diamond unit cells.\nThe \"thermal spike\" was created by heating the central\nlayers up to \"temperatures\" of 1.2-2.6 eV (14000-30000\nK). The 32 upper and 32 lower atoms of each sample\n(the upper and lower layers of a height of 3.55 \u00c5) were\nfrozen, i.e. the motion of these atoms was forbidden.\nThe initial geometry of the samples is shown in Fig. 2.\nThe outermost frozen diamond layers had the effect on\ntheir neighboring hot atoms of forcing them to return\nto their initial positions i.e. to regrow epitaxially back\nto diamond. In this way a temperature gradient from\nthe edges to the center of the sample was created. Once\nthe liquid phase reached equilibrium (this process was\ncontrolled by monitoring the total energy of the system),\nthe central layers were cooled to room temperature at\na cooling rate of 10 K/fs. The height of the hot layers\nvaried between 4 and 6 diamond unit cells and the width\nof the hot layers varied from 2 to 3 diamond unit cells.\nThe full time of cooling was 1.5 ps (3000 MD steps).\nHowever, the central layers ceased to move after the 750\nfirst MD steps, so the lifetime of our \"thermal spike\" was\n0.3 ps. This value is similar to the estimates of Marks25\nand Saada6 , 0.2ps and 0.21ps, respectively.\n\nDetails of the sample preparation\n2.\n\n1.\n\nDamaged diamond sandwiched between two layers of\ndiamond\n\nSix different samples with a density of 3.5 g/cc, initially\narranged as a perfect diamond crystal, were prepared.\nTheir sizes were 2 \u00d7 2\u00d7 6 (192 atoms), 2 \u00d7 2\u00d7 7 (224\n\nDamaged amorphous C region sandwiched between two\nlayers of frozen ta \u2212 C\n\nFour initial samples of diamond-like amorphous carbon\nat density 3.5 g/cc were prepared by heating diamond up\nto 5000 K followed by cooling of the liquid phase to 300\nK during 5 ps with an exponential cooling profile. Each\n\n\f4\nta \u2212 C amorphous sample contained 192 atoms with a\ngeometry 7.1 \u00c5\u00d7 7.1 \u00c5\u00d7 21.3 \u00c5. The samples contained\n66\u00b14 % of sp3 coordinated atoms. In order to achieve\na larger percentage of sp3 coordinated atoms (above 70\n%), two additional samples were prepared using the the\nfollowing procedure: the amorphous structure was prepared with a density of 4.0 g/cc by quenching a liquid\nphase down from 10000 K to 700 K with a cooling rate\nof about 500 K/ps, then the density was reduced from 4\nto 3.5 g/cc by uniform expansion, after which the temperature of the system was raised to 2500 K, and thereafter the structure was recooled to room temperature12 .\nThe two structures obtained at a final density of 3.5 g/cc\nconsisted of 84 % and 77.5 % of sp3 bonded atoms respectively.\nTo simulate a \"thermal spike\" in the diamond-like\namorphous carbon samples, the central region of each\nsample was heated to \"temperatures\" of 1.2-2.60 eV per\natom (14000-30000 K). The upper and lower layers of\na height of 3.55 \u00c5 each, were kept frozen. For the six\namorphous carbon samples the height of the hot layers\nwas 14.2 \u00c5 (128 atoms in average). A representation of\na typical initial sample geometry is given by Figure 2.\nDark atom at top and bottom indicate the frozen layers,\nthe light central ones are free to move and when heated,\nthere is a temperature gradient from the edges to the\ncenter of the samples. Following the heating stage the\nstructures were cooled to room temperature at a cooling rate of 10 K/fs. The time of calculations and the\nlifetime of the \"thermal spike\" were the same those described above for the case of the damaged region between\ntwo layers of perfect diamond.\n\nC.\n\nSample equilibration\n\nWe checked carefully, by monitoring of the total energy of the system, that the heating time was sufficiently\nlong to enable the liquid structure to reach equilibrium\n(early attempts to prepare samples of amorphous carbon\nby quenching from a liquid carbon that was not in equilibrium led to inconclusive results).\n\nD.\n\nRelevance to experiment\n\nOur aim is to determine the nature of transitions between different carbon bonds as the result of the passage\nof fast ions in samples of different initial structures. To\ndo this, we need to examine the region of passage and its\nintermediate neighbourhood on an atomistic scale. However, this microscopic region is contained in a larger carbon matrix, and while the microscopic region corresponds\ndirectly to that in the experiment, the surrounding matrix may differ in scale. We address the issues of system\nsize and temperature in relation to the parameters of experimental samples.\n\nIn the simulations, on one hand, a maximum of 432\natoms can be contained in a single sample due to computational limitations. On the other hand, the periodic\nboundary conditions mean that the sample is in a sense\ninfinite, and, in particular, has no surfaces. Thus the\nsimulation samples are both smaller and larger than the\nlaboratory experiment. We are investigating the local region around the ion path (which has a linear extent of 7.2\n\u00c5 along the track directon prior to repetition). The geometry was chosen so that this region is well surrounded,\nin the direction perpendicular to the track, by diamond\nor amorphous carbon matrix, which is frozen in place. In\nparticular, there are 7.4 \u00c5 between replicas of the tracks,\na region that is sufficient to avoid interaction since the\nrange of the potential is only 3 \u00c5. In order to ensure that\nthe samples are of sufficient size to enable reliable interpretations, a series of different sizes were used for each\nsituation and the effect of the scaling of the system size\nwas carefully investigated. Although this is not exactly\nequivalent to the finite size scaling31 that is commonly\napplied to phase transitions and critical phenomena, and\nis closer to the scaling used by Rosenblum et al32 in a\nstudy of thermal stress at diamond interfaces. The excellent agreement of both of these scaling approaches with\nresults from laboratory experiments gives us confidence\nin the concept. The collapse, as a function of system size,\nand the smoothness of the scaling that will be demonstrated below confirms that the results can be reliably\nextrapolated even further if needed.\nTemperature is introduced into the simulations as kinetic energy. In the laboratory, the region around the ion\ntrack is extremely hot for a very short time. The high\nheating \"temperatures\" of the simulation are thus large\namounts of kinetic energy imported the heated atoms.\nHere, too, we have studied the scaling of \"temperature\"\nwith system size. Not surprisingly, the actual \"temperature\" needed to attain specific structures is a function of\nsystem size. Again, collapse of graphs to a single functional form will be demonstrated and provides validation\nof our approach.\n\nIV.\n\nA.\n\nRESULTS OF TIGHT-BINDING\nSIMULATIONS\n\nDamaged diamond sandwiched between two\nlayers of intact diamond\n1.\n\nInfluence of the heating \"temperature\"\n\nWhen the diamond lattice in the central hot layers was\nmelted, sp2 and sp bonded atoms appeared in the liquid\nlayers. Upon cooling some (or all) of these sp2 and sp\nbonded atoms transformed back to sp3 coordinated C\natoms. The final fraction of threefold and twofold coordinated atoms depends on the kinetic energy per atom\n(\"temperature\") in the heating process. The higher the\nheating \"temperature\" of the atoms the larger was the ra-\n\n\f5\nT (eV/atom) Fourfold(%) Threefold (%) Twofold (%)\n1.55 eV\n100\n0\n0\n1.72 eV\n95\u00b15\n5\u00b15\n0\n1.98 eV\n79\u00b15\n19\u00b15\n2\u00b12\n2.41 eV\n74\u00b15\n23\u00b15\n3\u00b12\n2.58 eV\n62\u00b15\n34\u00b15\n4\u00b13\nTABLE I: Fraction of the four-, three-, and twofold coordinated atoms in the heated layers after cooling in the sample\nwith 192 atoms.\n\nFIG. 4: The fraction of threefold coordinated atoms in the hot\nlayers, shown during the process of cooling from the initial\n\"temperature\" of 1.725 eV and 1.98 eV/atom.

Samples initially heated to a relatively low \"temperature\" returned\nto diamond, whereas for hotter samples some non diamond bonds remained after cooling.\nFor example, let us consider the 2 \u00d7 2\u00d7 6 sample\ncontaining 192 atoms, 128 of which were free to move\n(i.e. were heated and subsequently cooled). The percentages of four-, three-, and twofold coordinated atoms\nin the hot layers after cooling from different \"temperatures\" are presented in Table I. Whenever the heating\n\"temperature\" was lower than 1.72 eV per atom all sp2\nand sp bonds disappeared in the process of cooling, and\nthe final, cooled, structure returned to a perfect diamond\nlattice, as shown in Fig. 3 where the percentages of different hybridizations are graphed as a function of cooling\n\"temperature\".\nAt higher initial heating \"temperatures\" the heated\nlayers remained, after cooling, partially or entirely amorphous. The fraction of three- and two-fold coordinated\natoms in the structure are shown in Fig. 4 which shows\nthe percentages of sp2 bonded atoms during the cooling\nprocess from different initial heating \"temperatures\".\nThe volume of the region remaining amorphous after\ncooling was found to increase with the heating \"temper-\n\nature\". In Fig. 5 visualization of some samples cooled\nfrom different heating \"temperatures\"are presented. We\nsee that in the sample where the heating \"temperature\"\nwas high (1.98 eV/atom) almost an entire layer of atoms\nwhich were free to move has transformed to amorphous\ncarbon with 19 % of sp2 bonds, while in the sample initially heated to 1.38 eV/atom only a small central region\nis amorphous and the layers which are adjacent to the\nfrozen part of the sample return to their crystalline diamond structure. The reason for the dependence of the\nvolume that remains amorphous on heating \"temperature\" is that at lower \"temperatures\" the frozen outer\nlayers of diamond extend their influence to larger distances, therefore a larger volume of the damaged region\nreconstructs to the diamond structure after cooling. A\ntendency to segregation of the threefold and the fourfold\natoms was observed in the samples heated to high temperatures when the volume of the region that remained\namorphous was sufficiently large (almost all non-frozen\natoms).\nThe radial distribution function (RDF) of the C atoms\nin the hot layers is presented in Fig. 6. The second\npeak is visible in the figure due to the layers which have\nreconstructed to diamond structure after cooling. However, as was explained above, the higher the \"heating\ntemperature\" the larger the volume of the region remaining amorphous. Therefore all RDF peaks related to the\nhigher heating \"temperature\" (dashed line) are lower and\nbroader. For high heating \"temperatures\" the overlapping peaks are a superposition of two peaks that correspond to sp2 bonded and sp3 bonded atoms.\nThe angular distribution function of the hot layers\ndemonstrates similar behavior, see Fig. 7. The peaks\nare lower and broader when the heating \"temperature\"\nis higher, this corresponds to a higher fraction of three-\n\n\f6\n\nFIG. 5: Amorphous carbon located between two layers of\ndiamond.

The angular distribution\npeak related to T =1.98 eV is located at 112\u25e6 (closer to\nthe ideal 120\u25e6 for sp2 bonded C atoms), while the peak\nof the curve related to 1.72 eV is located at 109\u25e6 (typical\nfor sp3 bonded atoms).\n\nEffects of the size of the hot layers.\n\nThe heating \"temperature\" is not the only factor that\ninfluenced the structure of the damaged region. If the\nheight of the layer with atoms that were free to move\nwas increased from 4 to 6 unit cells without changing the\nwidth of samples, the percentage of three- and twofold\ncoordinated atoms in the damaged layers, when heated\nto the same temperature also increased (see Table II). As\nwas explained above, the frozen layers assist the intermediate layers in their vicinity to return to diamond lattice\nstructure. The central atoms in the samples with a large\nnumber of the hot layers feel the influence of the diamond frozen layers to a lower extent, and therefore the\nvolume of the region remaining amorphous after cooling was large, with a high percentage of sp2 coordinated\natoms. In the small samples the central layers needed to\nbe heated to very high \"temperatures\" to diminish the\ninfluence of the outer frozen layers. The highest \"temperature\" at which the sample reconstructed its diamond\nlattice after cooling also depended on the height of the\nhot layers. This temperature decreased as the height of\nthe hot layers increased (see Table III).\nGraphs of the dependence of the percentage of sp2\nbonded atoms on the heating \"temperature\" are plotted\n\n\f7\nNumber of layers\nT\u2217\n4\n1.63 \u00b10.04 eV\n5\n1.51 \u00b10.04 eV\n6\n1.38 \u00b10.04 eV\nTABLE III: The upper \"temperature\" of heating at which the\nsamples reconstruct their diamond structure (T \u2217 ).\n\nFIG. 9: The same curves shifted to T \u2217 .

A striking feature of these curves\nis that they have the same shape for the different heights\nof the hot layer. All the curves can be fitted to a unique\nfunction f (T \u2212 T \u2217 ), where T \u2217 is the upper temperature\nof heating, at which the sample can return to diamond\nafter cooling. In Fig. 9 the collapse of the curves to a\nsingle scaling function is shown.\nThe samples with different width (from 32 to 72 atoms\nin each layer) at the same height of the hot layers also\ndemonstrate finite size effects. The percentage of threeand twofold coordinated atoms in the central layers is\nlarger in the wider samples at the same heating \"temperature\", the \"temperature\" at which the sample returns\nto diamond, T \u2217 , is higher for the thinner samples (see\nTable IV).\nWidth\nT\u2217\n1.72 eV\n32 atoms 1.63 \u00b10.04 eV 5 \u00b15\n48 atoms 1.48 \u00b10.04 eV 19 \u00b15\n72 atoms 1.29 \u00b10.04 eV 22 \u00b15\n\n2.07 eV\n20 \u00b15\n32 \u00b15\n41 \u00b15\n\nTABLE IV: The upper \"temperature\" of heating at which the\nsample reconstructed its diamond structure (T \u2217 ) and percentage of sp2 coordinated atoms in the samples cooled from 1.72\nand 2.07 eV per atom.\n\nSimulation of molten and cooled amorphous\ncarbon located between two frozen layers of\namorphous carbon.\n\nNow let us consider structure of a central amorphous\ncarbon layer sandwiched between two layers of frozen\namorphous carbon. After cooling, the central damaged region remained amorphous, but the sp2 /sp3 ratio changed. The dependence of this generated structure\non the heating \"temperature\" was similar to that of the\nprevious stage of the simulation (amorphous carbon between two layers of diamond). Namely, if the central\natoms were heated to higher \"temperatures\", the fraction of the sp2 bonded atoms increased (correspondingly,\nthe fraction of the sp3 bonded atoms decreased). Some\nof these structures were highly inhomogeneous, in particular when the initial sample contained a large fraction\nof fourfold bonded atoms and was heated to a relatively\nhigh \"temperature\". In Fig. 10 the visualization of some\nof these amorphous carbon samples is presented. We can\nsee that the frozen layers of the sample with 77.5 % of\nsp3 bonded atoms initially, contained after heating and\nsubsequent cooling 75 % of sp3 bonded atoms, while the\ncentral layers after heating to 2.33 eV and subsequent\nquenching contained only 39 % of the fourfold atoms.\nThe radial (RDF) and the angle (ADF) distribution\nfunctions of the central layers of this amorphous carbon sample after cooling from the \"temperatures\" of 1.55\neV and 2.33 eV are plotted in Figs. 11 and 12 respectively. The peaks corresponding to the higher temperatures of heating were lower, broader, and slightly shifted\ntoward the shorter, graphitelike, bond length and larger,\ngraphitelike, bond angle relative to those at the lower\ntemperatures. This indicates a higher fraction of the sp2\nbonded atoms.\nIt is obvious that the percentage of differently coor-\n\n\f8\n\nFIG. 10: Samples of amorphous carbon located between two\nlayers of ta \u2212 C amorphous carbon: the initial sample (77.5 %\nof sp3 ) (left), and the samples after cooling from 2.07 eV (in\nthe center), and from 2.33 eV (right).

Boundaries between frozen layers and layers\nof atoms which are free to move are denoted by arrows.\n\ndinated atoms in the frozen layers has influence on the\nresults of the central region. The samples initially containing a larger fraction of the sp2 bonded atoms, contained a larger fraction of the sp2 bonded atoms after\ncooling (at the same temperature of heating). Fig. 13\nshows the final percentage of sp2 coordinated atoms as\na function of heating \"temperature\" plotted for samples\nwith different percentage of sp3 and sp2 bonded atoms\nbefore heating of the central layers. The data related to\nthe smaller initial fraction of sp2 atoms have a lower final\nfraction of the sp2 .\nC.\n\nFIG. 11: Radial distribution function g(r) of central layers\nof the sample containing 77.5 % of sp3 coordinated atoms\ninitially (79 % of sp3 in the central layers) cooled from two\ndifferent \"temperatures\": after cooling from 1.55 eV the central layers contained 78 % of sp3 coordinated atoms, while\nafter cooling from 2.33 eV the central layers contained 39 %\nof sp3 coordinated atoms.\n\nThe band gap\n\nDuring the calculations many samples of amorphous\ncarbon with different structures were generated. The\nwidth of the band gap was \"measured\" for most of them\nby computing of density of states (DOS) as function of\nenergy. For example, the graph of density of states for\ntwo samples of amorphous carbon, containing 86 % of sp3\nbonded atoms and 53 % of sp3 bonded atoms is plotted\nin Fig. 14. The bandgap of the sample with 86 % of sp3\nbonded atoms was estimated visually from the graph to\nbe 2.3 eV. The sample with 53 % of sp3 bonded atoms\ndoes not indicate the presence of any band gap, this sample is expected to be electrically conducting. The width\nof the band gap depends not only on the fraction of the\ndifferently coordinated atoms, but also on their individual configuration, i.e on the local clustering of sp2 bonded\natoms. Fig. 15 shows a plot of the width of the bandgap\nas a function of the fraction of sp2 coordinated atoms in\nvarious ta \u2212 C samples.\nThere is a noticeable scattering of the points between\n60 and 75 % of sp3 bonded atoms. We suspect that in\n\nFIG. 12: Angular distribution function of central layers of the\nsample containing 77.5 % of sp3 coordinated atoms initially\n(79 % of sp3 in the central layers) cooled from two different\n\"temperatures\".\n\nthis interval the fraction of sp2 bonded atoms increases\nsufficiently to begin to create clusters. If the fraction of\nthe sp2 atoms is smaller than 25 %, than only separated\nsp2 bonded atoms are embedded in the sp3 amorphous\nnetwork. If the fraction of the sp2 atoms is larger than 40\n%, the sp2 clusters begin to connect one with another.\nThe band gap disappears when the fraction of the sp2\nbonded atoms reaches 45 %.\n\n\f9\n\nFIG. 13: The final percentage of sp2 coordinated atoms as\na function of heating \"temperature\" plotted for samples with\ndifferent percentage of sp3 and sp2 bonded atoms before heating of the central layers.

The error bars represent\nan unaccuracy in visual determination of the band gap from\nDOS.\n\ndiamond or amorphous carbon along their paths causes\na rearragement of the carbon atoms and can lead to a\ntransformation of the insulating diamond or amorphous\ndiamond-like sp3 form of carbon into a conducting layer\nrich in sp2 bonded carbon atoms. In the simulations we\nmodeled the transformation of highly ordered diamond\nstructures into amorphous structures with the presence of\ngraphitic like sp2 -bonds. In the samples which were initially amorphous, rearragement of the amorphous structure and an increase of the fraction of sp2 bonded atoms\nhas occurred.\nThe experiments5,33 show that the resistivity, both in\ndiamond and in amorphous carbon networks, decreases\nwith ion dose. In diamond there exists a critical damage\ndensity Dc below which the diamond restores this pristine structure after annealing34 . At D = D2 a sharp drop\nin resistivity is observed and at higher doses graphitic\nconduction is measured in the irradiated volume. Kalish\net al35 investigated the possibility that the sharp drop\nin resistivity could be explained in terms of a percolation transition between conducting islands produced by\nthe impinging ion, but found that the R vs D dependence\nwas not sharp enough to be consistent with such a simple\npercolation theory. By contrast, Hoffman et al36 in their\nexperiment on 1keV Ar irradiated diamond proved that\nthe amorphization is a very sudden process and at D2\nthe diamond collapses to an amorphous but still highly\ninsulating form similar to amorphous diamond (ta \u2212 C).\nOnly at doses exceeding those required for amorphization, does the amorphous sp3 structure transform to an\namorphous sp2 structure which is electrically conducting. In our simulation at low \"heating \" temperatures\nthat corresponds to a slower or lighter ion impact, the\ndiamond also reconstructs this structure after cooling.\nAt higher heating \"temperatures\" the structure remains\n\n\f10\namorphous after cooling and the fraction of sp2 bonded\natoms in the damaged region increases with the heating\n\"temperatures\". The faster the ion the larger the damaged region. In our simulation increasing of the heated\nvolume leaded to increasing of sp2 fraction in this ion\ntrack and to increasing of conductivity.\nExperimental results33 show that in contrast to diamond , for ta \u2212 C where no crystalline template exists,\nthere is nothing to inhibit the sp3 to sp2 bond conversion, hence there is no reason to expect a critical dose\nat which a sharp increase in the electrical conductivity\nshould start. Moreover, the decrease of the electrical resistivity in ta \u2212 C occurs at much lower implantation\ndose than in diamond33 . The results of electron energyloss spectroscopy allows to estimate the fraction of sp2\nbonds, f , in ion implanted ta \u2212 C. At low ion doses the f\nincreases linearly with ion dose, at a dose 1014 ions/cm3\n,f becomes less sensitive and increases only slightly with\ndose. In our calculation ta \u2212 C becomes conductor at\nmuch lower heating \"temperatures\" than diamond, this\nmeans that in contrast to ta \u2212 C, diamond needs an additional energy to break its crystal lattice and lead to\namorphization upon cooling.\nThe conductivity in our amorphous carbon samples deduced from the shrinkage of the band gap increases with\npercentage of sp2 bonded atoms in the damaged region.\nThere are some slight discrepancies with experimental\nstudies of electronic structure of damaged region. For\nexample, McCulloch et al33 found a band gap of 2.5 eV\nat 85 % of sp3 bonded atoms, whereas we find that a\nvalue of 3.3 eV corresponds the fraction of 84 % of the\nsp3 atoms.\nVI.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe have simulated a damaged region occuring in diamond and in diamond-like amorphous carbon by local\nheating of a slab in the sample of thickness comparable\nto that created by the \"thermal spike\" due to the passage of an energetic ion followed by quenching back to\nroom temperature. The \"temperature\" of the heating\nvaried from 1.2 to 2.59 eV/atom (14000-30000 K). For\nthe case of diamond we found that at a heating \"temperature\" higher than a characteristic temperature T \u2217 a\nsmall region in the center of the sample remains amorphous. The size and the structure of the amorphous region depends on the heating \"temperature\"; the size and\nthe fraction of three- and two-coordinated atoms in the\n\n\u2217\n1\n\nElectronic address: anastasy@techunix.technion.ac.il;\nURL: http://phycomp.technion.ac.il/~anastasy/\nM.

When\nwe increased the number of the free-to-move layers, the\nfraction of three- and two-coordinated atoms in the central layers increased. The curves of the dependence of\nthe fraction of the sp2 bonded atoms in the central layers on the temperature of heating have similar shape for\ndifferent sizes of the hot layers.\nThe same procedure was applied to simulate a damaged region in amorphous carbon samples. The central\nlayers of each sample were melted at a very high temperatures (1.29-2.33 eV/atom) and then cooled by keeping the\nouter layers frozen. The percentage of three- and twofold\ncoordinated atoms in the obtained damaged region was\nfound to increase with heating \"temperature\" and with\nthe initial fraction of the threefold coordinated atoms in\nthe sample. Most of the structures of amorphous carbon generated in different stages of our simulation were\nhighly inhomogeneous and clustering of sp2 bonded C\natoms has been observed.\nThe band gap measured for all the amorphous carbon samples became narrower when the population of\nsp2 bonded atoms increased. It vanished when the fraction of sp2 bonded atoms reached a value of 45 %. Beyond this fraction the damage affected volume becomes\nconductive.\nThe results obtained in this study support the experimental conclusions that in the damaged region formed\nafter the passage of a heavy fast ion either through diamond or amorphous carbon, amorphization and sometimes conversion of sp3 bonds to sp2 bonds occurs. Another conclusion which follows from the simulations is\nthat after passing of a faster (or heavier) ion (that corresponds to higher temperature of the \"thermal spike\"),\nthe damaged region is larger and more sp3 bonds are\ntransformed to sp2 . Although the present simulations do\nnot exactly reproduce the conditions of the experimental \"thermal spike\", qualitatively our results are in good\nagreement with experiments.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe are grateful to Dr. G.
