It is argued that the small dimensions of these systems enable to make use\nof unique intra-molecular quantum coherences in order to pump electrons between two leads and\nto overcome relaxation processes which tend to suppress the pumping efficiency. In particular, we\ndemonstrate that a selective transient excitation of one chromophore in a bi-chromophoric donorbridge-acceptor molecular junction model yields currents which transfer charge (electron and holes)\nunevenly to the two leads in the absence of a bias potential. The utility of this mechanism for charge\npumping in steady state conditions is proposed.\n\nSingle molecule junctions were explored and studied\nextensively in recent years[1] primarily due to their potential for nano-electronics devices. Indeed, non trivial current-voltage characteristics were measured, reflecting the unique properties of organic molecules, associated with their detailed structure[2\u20134]. Less attention\nwas given to the possibility of using single molecule\njunction as energy conversion devices. However, the\nsuccessful implementation of organic molecules in solar\ncells[5], and the quest for energy conversion units on\nthe nanoscale, raise an intriguing challenge of designing particular molecular structures that can function as\nenergy conversion units in a junction architecture. In\nthis work bi-chromophoric molecules are suggested as\nappropriate candidates for this application. Asymmetric Donor-Bridge-Acceptor molecules in which two chromophores are separated by a molecular bridge were suggested in the past as effective molecular current rectifiers\n[6]. Below we study their function as electron pumps in\na single molecule junction. The small dimensions of the\nproposed systems enables to make use of their unique\nintra-molecular quantum coherences in order to pump\nelectrons between the leads and to over come relaxation\nprocesses which tend to suppress the pumping efficiency.\nCurrent generation by electron pumping is facilitated in\nthe absence of bias by a time-dependent excitation. The\npossibility of controlling electronic currents in molecular junctions by periodic external fields was discussed\nintensively[4, 7\u201310]. In particular, monochromatic, bichromatic[4, 10] or pulsed [11\u201313] electromagnetic radiation fields were proposed as means of controlling the\ncurrent intensity under steady state conditions. Given\nan appropriate asymmetry of the junction such external fields can induce net current generation even in the\nabsence of bias. This was anticipated, e.g, when the coupling to the electrodes differs in the ground and excited\nmolecular state[14]. Although pumps are usually discussed in the context of periodic driving [15\u201317], in order\nto pinpoint the underlying mechanism of the molecular\n\n\u2217\n\nuri@tx.technion.ac.il\n\nenergy converter, we consider below a single pumping cycle in which one of the chromophores (termed \"donor\")\nis subjected to a sudden excitation.\nThe DBA molecule is represented as three electronic\nsites corresponding to the donor(D), bridge(B) and acceptor(A) molecular groups (see Fig. 1). Invoking for\nsimplicity a non interacting spinless electrons picture, the\nmolecular model Hamiltonian reads,\n\u0124M =\n\n3\n3\n2 X\nX\nX\n(\u03b2m,l d\u2020m,l dm\u22121,l + h.c)]\n\u03b5m,l d\u2020m,l dm,l +\n[\nl=1 m=1\n\nm=2\n\n(1)\nd\u2020m,l (dm,l ) is a creation (annihilation) operator for an\nelectron at the l th single particle state (orbital) of the\nm th molecular site, \u03b5m,l is the corresponding orbital\nenergy, and {\u03b2m,l,l0 } are the inter-site coupling (hopping) integrals between the two manifolds of orbitals at\nthe m th and m-1 th neighboring sites. The indexes\nl = 1 and l = 2 point to the Highest Occupied Molecular\nOrbital(HOMO) and Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital(LUMO) at each site, and the indexes m = 1, 2, 3\nrepresent the D, B and A sites respectively. In view\nof the relatively large HOMO-LUMO energy gaps, the\ninter-site couplings were restricted to a diagonal form,\n\nFIG. 1. A scheme for DBA molecular junction at zero bias.\nNotice that the LUMO levels of the D and A sites are degenerate but the HOMO-LUMO energy gaps are different. An\ninitial D excitation (marked by the dashed arrow) is followed\nby transient electronic currents (thick arrows) from left to\nright.\n\n\f2\n\u03b2m,l,l0 = \u03b2m,l \u03b4l,l0 (off-diagonal terms yielded insignificant\nchanges to the results reported below), and all inter-site\ncouplings were given the same value, \u03b2m,l \u2261 \u03b2. The\nvalue of \u03b2 is strongly sensitive to the bridge length and\ncomposition, and determines the time scale for coherent\ntunneling between D and A. Since coherent tunneling\nplays an important role here, the value was taken larger\nthan KB T . Asymmetry of the bichromophoric molecule\nis reflected in different HOMO-LUMO gaps at the donor\nand acceptor sites, i.e., \u03b51,2 \u2212 \u03b51,1 > \u03b53,2 \u2212 \u03b53,1 , where\nthe effective electronic coupling between the D and A\nsites is mediated by the bridge HOMO-LUMO gap. Here\nwe focus on a particular system in which the D and A\nLUMO states are degenerate, i.e \u03b51,2 = \u03b53,2 . (a similar\neffect would be obtained if the degeneracy would apply\nto the HOMO states). A schematic representation of the\nmodel is given in Fig.1. In view of the differences between\nthe HOMO-LUMO gaps at the different molecular sites,\ndirect intra-molecular exciton energy transfer [18] is inefficient, and terms of the type (\u221d d\u2020m,l dm,l0 d\u2020m0 ,l0 dm0 ,l )\nwere excluded in Eq.1.\nThe terminal sites (D and A) are coupled to two (left\nand right, respectively) electrodes, so that the full Hamiltonian reads,\n\u0124 = \u0124M + \u0124e + \u0124e,M .\n\n(2)\n\nThe electrodes are modeled\nof non interP as reservoirs\nP\n\u2020\nacting electrons, \u0124e =\n\u03b5\nb\nJ=R,L\nk k,j k,j bk,j where\nb\u2020k,j (bk,j ) is a creation (annihilation) operator of an electron in the kth single particle state of the Jth electrode' conduction band. The molecule-electrodes coupling terms correspond to electron transfer (hopping)\nbetween the D and A sites and the respective electrode, i.e., \u0124e,M = V\u0302L \u2297 \u00dbL + V\u0302R \u2297 \u00dbR + h.c, with\nP2\nP2\nP\n\u2020\n\u2020\nV\u0302L \u2261\nl=1 d1,l , V\u0302R \u2261\nl=1 d3,l , \u00dbL \u2261\nk uk,L bk,L ,\nP\nand \u00dbR \u2261\nu\nb\n.\nFor\nsimplicity,\nelectron\nenk k,R k,R\nergy transfer from the molecular excitons to electronhole pairs creation at the leads [19] is not accounted for.\nThe values of {uk,J } reflect the spectral density function of the Jth electrode. Below, each electrode is modeled as a half-filled tight binding chain with a bandwidth\n|4\u03b3J | and an electrochemical potential, \u03bcJ .

As one can see,\nthere is a net charge transfer from the left electrode to\nthe right one, QL > 0, QR < 0, (see also the inset, for the\ntransient currents). The \"charge pumping\" efficiency, regarded here as the net amount of charge transferred from\nthe left electrode to the right one, increases and reaches a\nmaximum as the B level approaches resonance with the\nD and A levels. The charge transfer between the electrodes reflects intramolecular dynamics as presented in\nFig.2b. The apparent dominant processes following the\ninitial excitation at the donor are a decay of the hole\nat the donor HOMO (see D,1), and two decay processes\nof the electron from the donor LUMO: One is a direct\nrelaxation to the left electrode (see D,2) and the other\nis an indirect relaxation to the right electrode following\ncoherent tunneling from the D to the A LUMO level (see\nA,2). When the bridge LUMO is detuned from the D/A\nLUMOs (i.e., when |\u03b2| << |\u03b52,2 \u2212 \u03b51,2 |) the period of the\nDA tunneling oscillations can be approximated by the\n~|\u03b5 \u2212\u03b51,2 |\nMcConnell formula [23], \u03c4DA \u221d 2,2\n, and becomes\n|\u03b2|2\nshorter as the gap between the B and the D(A) orbital\nenergies decreases. As the period becomes sufficiently\nshort on the time scale of the electron relaxation to the\nleads, electron hopping to the right becomes as frequent\nas electron hopping to the left. Since the hole relaxes predominantly to the left lead, the balance of these processes\nis net transfer of negative charge from left to right.\nIt is emphasized that although the simple model\noutlined above is formulated in the language of non\ninteracting particles, it can guide a search for real\nbichromophoric systems where the proposed mechanism\n\nof coherent pumping following a local excitation of a\ndonor chromophore should be observed. Considering a\nbichromophoric molecule where the two different chromophores, are weakly coupled to each other and to the\nleads, the condition for near degeneracy of the two LUMOs in the non-interacting model corresponds to a generalized condition for a near degeneracy between the first\nexcited (many body) state of one of the chromophores the\n\"Donor\" and a charge transfer (many body) state of the\nbichromophoric system. In such a case, local excitation\nof the Donor would result in to intra-molecular dynamical charge oscillations, followed by the proposed charge\npumping.\nLet us now consider a possible effect of bridge vibrations on the pumping efficiency. For this purpose we extend the model to account for linear on-site coupling of\nthe bridge excited state to a harmonic mode. The model\nDBA Hamiltonian (Eq.(1)) is replaced by,\n\u03bb\n\u0124M,vib = \u0124M + \u221a (c\u2020 + c)d\u20202,2 d2,2 + ~\u03a9(c\u2020 c + 1/2) (6)\n2\nThe last term is the nuclear contribution, where c\u2020 (c) is\na creation (annihilation) operator of a vibration quantum, ~\u03a9, and the vibronic coupling strength is mea\u03bb2\n.\nsured by the bridge reorganization energy, \u2206 = 2~\u03a9\nIn Fig.3, the effect of \u2206 on the pumping efficiency is\ndemonstrated. The acceptor and bridge HOMO states,\nwhich remain occupied and hardly participate in the\ndynamics (See Fig.2), were excluded in this case (see\nTable I), and the initial electronic excitation was represented as \u03c1\u0302M,vib (0) = \u03c1\u0302M (0) \u2297 |0ih0|, where (|0i) is\nthe vibrational ground state. The left-to-right electron\npumping efficiency is shown to modulate as a function\nof the vibronic coupling strength, where efficiency peaks\n(\u2212QR = QL \u2248 0.5) are obtained near \u2206 \u2248 0.05, 0.11.\nAs above, the increased efficiency corresponds to resonances between the donor and acceptor LUMO orbitals\nand, in this case, vibronic eigenstates of the bridge, where\nthe peak efficiency corresponds to \u03b52,2 \u2212 \u2206 \u2248 0, ~\u03a9 respectively. Again, approaching the resonance condition\nguarantees that the frequency of tunneling oscillations\nbetween the D and A exceeds the rate of charge relaxation to the electrodes, and thus the charge pumping\n\n\f4\nefficiency increases. Notice that the efficiency peaks in\nFig.3 are characterized by a slow rise, followed by a fast\nfall as \u2206 increases. This reflects a characteristic FranckCondon blockade effect [3]. Focusing on the first resonance, one can approximate the tunneling frequency by\n\u2206\n2 \u2212 ~\u03a9\n\n2\u03b2 e\n, (for\na generalized McConnell formula [24], \u03bd = ~|\u03b5\n2,2 \u2212\u2206|\n\u03b51,2 = \u03b53,2 = 0). As \u2206 rises from zero, two effects are\ncompeting. The energy barrier for through-bridge tunneling (|\u03b52,2 \u2212 \u2206|) decreases, and the hopping frequency\nto the bridge, scaled by the Franck Condon (FC) overlap between the ground vibrational states of the empty\nand electronically charged bridge, decreases as well. For\nsufficiently small \u2206 the exponential drop in the FC factor is minor, and the decrease in the barrier energy leads\nto increasing tunneling frequency. Increasing \u2206 farther,\nbeyond the resonance point, the tunneling frequency decreases due to a rise in |\u03b52,2 \u2212 \u2206|, but the fall is much\nsharper than the rise since the donor-bridge hoping is\nadditionally blocked as the FC factor becomes exponentially small. A similar qualitative modulation is observed\nfor larger \u2206 values due to the first excited vibration state\nof the bridge.\nIn conclusion, the versatility of organic compounds\nand the ability to control their electronic structure by\nchemical substitutions should make the preparation of\nbi-chromophoric DBA molecules as discussed here a realistic task.

In particular, irradiation of one of the chromophores can be converted into charge pumping even in\nthe absence of a bias potential. The focus of the present\nwork was on a single pumping cycle. An extension of this\nstudy to account for the details of the excitation field\nwould enable to consider the operation of a multi-cycle\n(periodic) electron pump at steady state. According to\nthe above analysis, the pumping direction would reflect\nthe selection of either one of the two chromophores as\nthe \"donor\" by the excitation field. Moreover, the possibility for pumping at steady state against an opposing\nbias voltage suggests the utility of the proposed molecular\njunction for electric energy storage. The analysis of the\nappropriate field parameters that would induce the required functions given the particular molecular electronic\nstructure is a future challenge, as well as the inclusion\nof several effects that were left out for simplicity in the\npresent work, but are not expected to change its qualitative conclusions. These include the role of Coulomb\nrepulsion and electronic correlations at the molecule, the\nvibronic structure of the chromophores, and the effect of\nenergy transfer to the leads.
