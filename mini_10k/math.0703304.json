As a corollary, we prove that this is\nalways the case when G is a direct product of an Abelian group with a direct product (sometimes\nalso called a direct sum) of a family of countable groups. This is the widest class of groups known to\ndate where the answer to the 63 years old problem of Markov turns out to be positive. We also prove\nthat whether every unconditionally closed subset of G is algebraic or not is completely determined\nby countable subgroups of G.\n\nAccording to Markov [6], a subset S of a group G is called:\n(a) elementary algebraic if there exist an integer n > 0, a1 , . . . , an \u2208 G and \u03b51 , . . . , \u03b5n \u2208 {\u22121, 1} such\nthat S = {x \u2208 G : x\u03b51 a1 x\u03b52 a2 . . . an\u22121 x\u03b5n = an },\n(b) algebraic if S is an intersection of finite unions of elementary algebraic subsets of G,\n(c) unconditionally closed if S is closed in every Hausdorff group topology of G.\n\nSince the family of all finite unions of elementary algebraic subsets of G is closed under finite unions\nand contains all finite sets, it is a base of closed sets of some T1 topology ZG on G, called the Zariski\ntopology of G. (This topology is also known under the name verbal topology, see [1].) The family of all\nunconditionally closed subsets of G coincides with the family of closed subsets of a T1 topology MG on\nG, namely the infimum (taken in the lattice of all topologies on G) of all Hausdorff group topologies on\nG. We call MG the Markov topology of G. Note that (G, ZG ) and (G, MG ) are quasi-topological groups,\ni.e., the inversion and shifts are continuous.\nFact 1. ZG \u2286 MG for every group G.\n\nProof. An elementary algebraic subset of G must be closed in every Hausdorff group topology on G.\nIn 1944 Markov [6] asked if the equality ZG = MG holds for every group G. He himself obtained a\npositive answer in case G is countable:\nFact 2. (Markov's theorem [6]) ZG = MG for every countable group G.\nMoreover, in the same manuscript [6] Markov attributes to Perel'man the fact that ZG = MG for every\nAbelian group G. To the best of our knowledge the proof of this fact has never appeared in print until\n[2]. (We offer an alternative self-contained proof of this result in Corollary 4.4.) A consistent example of\na group G with ZG 6= MG was announced quite recently in [10].\n\u2217\n\nDipartimento di Matematica e Informatica, Unive rsit\u00e0 di Udine, Via delle Scienze 206, 33100 Udine, Italy; e-mail :\ndikranja@dimi.uniud.it\n\u2020\nGraduate School of Science and Engineering, Division of Mathematics, Physics and Earth Sciences, Ehime University,\nMatsuyama 790-8577, Japan; e-mail : dmitri@dpc.ehime-u.ac.jp\n\n\f1\n\nZariski and Markov embeddings\n\nIf H be a subgroup of a group G, then ZG \u21beH = {U \u2229 H : U \u2208 ZG } denotes the subspace topology on H\ngenerated by ZG , and MG \u21beH = {U \u2229 H : U \u2208 MG } denotes the subspace topology on H generated by\nMG . Note that one always have ZH \u2286 ZG \u21beH and MH \u2286 MG \u21beH . This motivates the following definition:\nDefinition 1.1. We say that a subgroup H of a group G is:\n(i) Zariski embedded in G provided that ZH = ZG \u21beH , i.e., the subspace topology induced on H by the\nZariski topology of G coincides with the Zariski topology of H,\n(ii) Markov embedded in G provided that MH = MG \u21beH , i.e., the Markov topology of H coincides with\nthe subspace topology induced on H by the Markov topology of G.\nWe shall see in the sequel that every subgroup H of an Abelian group G is both Zariski embedded\nand Markov embedded in G. For every infinite Abelian group H there exists a (necessarily non-Abelian)\ngroup G containing H as a subgroup such that H is not Markov embedded in G (see Remark 5.8(ii)).\nAn example of a subgroup H of a (necessarily non-Abelian) group G that is neither Zariski embedded\nnor Markov embedded in G can be found in Remark 6.3.\nDistinguishing Zariski and Markov embeddings is surprisingly difficult. Indeed, our next lemma indicates that the difference, if any, is closely related to Markov's problem.\nLemma 1.2. Let H be a subgroup of a group G.\n(a) if ZH = MH and H is Markov embedded in G, then H is also Zariski embedded in G.\n(b) if ZG = MG and H is Zariski embedded in G, then H is also Markov embedded in G.\nProof. (a) From Fact 1, we have ZG \u21beH \u2286 MG \u21beH . Since H is Markov embedded in G, we have ZH \u2286\nZG \u21beH \u2286 MG \u21beH = MH . Since ZH = MH , we get ZH = ZG \u21beH . This means that H is Zariski embedded in\nG.\n(b) From the assumptions of (b) we get ZH = ZG \u21beH = MG \u21beH . Since ZH \u2286 MH , this proves\nMG \u21beH \u2286 MH . Since the converse inclusion MH \u2286 MG \u21beH always holds, we obtain MH = MG \u21beH . This\nmeans that H is Markov embedded in G.\nRemark 1.3. A careful analysis of the above proof reveals that ZH = MH holds under the assumption\nof item (b) of Lemma 1.2.\nCorollary 1.4. Let H be a countable subgroup of a group G.\n(a) If H is Markov embedded in G, then H is also Zariski embedded in G.\n(b) If, in addition, also G is countable, then H is Markov embedded in G if and only if H is Zariski\nembedded in G.\nProof. Immediately follows from Lemma 1.2 and Fact 2.\nCorollary 1.5. Let H be a Markov embedded subgroup of a group G with MG = ZG . Then H is Zariski\nembedded in G if and only if MH = ZH .\nProof. Apply Remark 1.3 and Lemma 1.2.\n\n\f2\n\nHausdorff embeddings\n\nDefinition 2.1. [3] A subgroup H of a group G is called:\n(i) Hausdorff embedded in G provided that every Hausdorff group topology T on H is a restriction of\nsome Hausdorff group topology T \u2217 on G (and in this case we say that T \u2217 extends T ),\n(ii) super-normal (in G) provided that for every x \u2208 G there exists y \u2208 H such that x\u22121 hx = y \u22121 hy\nfor all h \u2208 H.\nObviously, super-normal subgroups are normal.\nLemma 2.2. A normal subgroup H of a group G is super-normal if and only if G = cG (H)H, where\ncG (H) is the centralizer of H in G.\nProof. Assume H is super-normal and pick an element x \u2208 G. Then there exists y \u2208 H such that\ny \u22121hy = x\u22121 hx for all h \u2208 H. Then xy \u22121 \u2208 cG (H), so x \u2208 cG (H)H.\nIf G = cG (H)H, then for x \u2208 G there exists y \u2208 H such that x \u2208 cG (H)y. This means that\nxy \u22121 \u2208 cG (H), and hence xy \u22121 h = hxy \u22121 for all h \u2208 H. This yields y \u22121hy = x\u22121 hx for every h \u2208 H.\nThe lemma gives the following immediate corollary.\nCorollary 2.3. Every direct summand, as well as every central subgroup, is super-normal. In particular,\nevery subgroup of an Abelian group is super-normal.\nThe next theorem characterizing Hausdorff embedded normal subgroups is taken from [3]. We give its\nproof here for the reader's convenience.\nTheorem 2.4. Let N be a normal subgroup of the group G. Then N is Hausdorff embedded in G iff the\nautomorphisms of N induced by conjugation by elements of G are continuous for any group topology on\nN.\nProof. The necessity is obvious since the conjugations are continuous in any topological group. Assume\nnow that all automorphisms of N induced by the conjugation by elements of G are T -continuous for\nany Hausdorff group topology T on N. Fix a Hausdorff group topology T on N. Take the filter of\nall neighbourhoods of 1 in (N, T ) as a base of neighbourhoods of 1 in a group topology \u03c3 of G. This\nworks since the only axiom to check is to find, for every x \u2208 G and every \u03c3-neighbourhood U of 1, a\n\u03c3-neighbourhood V of 1 such that V x := x\u22121 V x \u2286 U. Since we can choose U, V contained in N, this\nimmediately follows from our assumption of T -continuity of the restrictions to N of the conjugations in\nG.\nCorollary 2.5. Every normal cyclic subgroup is Hausdorff embedded.\nProof. Assume H is a normal cyclic subgroup of a group G. Then every automorphism of H is continuous\nin any group topology of H. Therefore, Theorem 2.4 applies.\nCorollary 2.6. If a subgroup H of a group G is super-normal in G, then H is Hausdorff embedded in\nG.\nProof. As H is super-normal, each conjugation by an element of G coincides with the conjugation by\nsome element of H, so each such conjugation is continuous in any group topology on H. Now Theorem\n2.4 applies.\nThe implication in the above corollary is not reversible: a normal Hausdorff embedded subgroup H of\na group G need not be super-normal in G [3].\nThe following lemma is obvious.\n\n\fLemma 2.7. Let H be a subgroup of a group G. If H is Hausdorff embedded in G, then H is also Markov\nembedded in G.\nIn [3], a normal subgroup of a countable group G is constructed such that H is Zariski embedded in\nG but not Hausdorff embedded in G. By Corollary 1.4(b), H is also Markov embedded in G. This shows\nthat the implication of Lemma 2.7 is not reversible, even for a normal subgroup H.\nRemark 2.8. If h : G \u2192 G1 is a group isomorphism and the subgroup H of G is Hausdorff embedded\n(Markov embedded, Zariski embedded) in G, then the subgroup f (H) of G1 is Hausdorff embedded\n(respectively, Markov embedded, Zariski embedded) in G1 .\nOur next result uncovers a curious fact: If a countable subgroup H of a group G fails to be Hausdorff\nembedded, then this failure can always be witnessed by some metric group topology on H.\nTheorem 2.9. Let H be a countable subgroup of a group G. If every metric group topology on H can be\nextended to a (not necessarily metric) group topology on G, then H is Hausdorff embedded in G.\nProof. Let T be a Hausdorff group topology on H. Then T has a countable network, and the main\nresult of [8] implies that T is the supremum of some family {Ti : i \u2208 I} of group topologies on H with a\ncountable base. Then each Ti is metric, and so by the assumption of our lemma, there exists a Hausdorff\ngroup topology Ti\u2217 on G extending Ti . Now the supremum of the family {Ti\u2217 : i \u2208 I} is the Hausdorff\ngroup topology on G that obviously induces T on H. Hence, H is Hausdorff embedded.\nLet M (Z, H) denote the class of group embeddings H \u0592\u2192 G such that H is Markov (resp., Zariski,\nHausdorff) embedded in G. Then one can easily verify that M, Z and H are stable under composition\nand left cancellation. More precisely:\nLemma 2.10. If H1 \u2264 H2 \u2264 G are groups and i1 : H1 \u0592\u2192 H2 , i2 : H2 \u0592\u2192 G and i2 \u25e6 i1 : H1 \u0592\u2192 G are the\nrespective inclusions, then:\n(a) i1 , i2 \u2208 M (i1 , i2 \u2208 Z, H) implies i2 \u25e6 i1 \u2208 M (respectively, i2 \u25e6 i1 \u2208 Z, i2 \u25e6 i1 \u2208 H);\n(b) if i2 \u25e6 i1 \u2208 M (i2 \u25e6 i1 \u2208 Z, H) , then also i1 \u2208 M (respectively, i1 \u2208 Z, i1 \u2208 H).\nLemma 2.11. Let H be a subgroup of the direct product G = G1 \u00d7 G2 . If the subgroup G1 \u2229 H of G1 is\nMarkov embedded in G1 , then G1 \u2229 H is Markov embedded in H as well.\nProof. Indeed, as a direct summand of G, G1 is super-normal in G. By Corollary 2.6 and Lemma 2.7,\nG1 is Markov embedded in G, so Lemma 2.10(a) allows us to conclude that G1 \u2229 H is Markov embedded\nin G. Applying now Lemma 2.10(b) we conclude that G1 \u2229 H is Markov embedded in H.\nBy Lemma 2.10, the classes M and H (of Markov embeddings and Hausdorff embeddings) are closed\nunder composition and left cancellation. Now we are going to show that these classes are not closed\nunder pullback. More precisely, if G1 \u0592\u2192 G is a Hausdorff embedding and H is a subgroup of G, then we\nshall see that the induced embedding G1 \u2229 H \u0592\u2192 H need not be even a Markov embedding. We take G\nof the special form G = G1 \u00d7 G2 , so that G1 \u0592\u2192 G, being the inclusion of a direct summand, is certainly\na Hausdorff embedding, hence a Markov embedding (Lemma 2.7). Then for an appropriate subgroup H\nof G = G1 \u00d7 G2 we show that G1 \u2229 H \u0592\u2192 H is not a even a Markov embedding. By Lemma 2.11, this\nwill show that also G1 \u2229 H \u0592\u2192 G1 fails to be a Markov embedding.\nLemma 2.12. Let N be a countable Abelian group that admits a decomposition N = N1 \u00d7 N2 into a\ndirect product of two infinite groups N1 and N2 . Then there exist a countable group G\u2032 , a subgroup H of\nthe direct product G = G1 \u00d7 G2 , where G1 = G2 = G\u2032 , and a metric group topology T \u2217 on G\u2217 = H \u2229 G1\nhaving the following properties:\n\n\f(i) G\u2217 is isomorphic to N and [H : G\u2217 ] = 2,\n(ii) G\u2217 is neither Markov nor Zariski embedded in H,\n(iii) T \u2217 cannot be extended to any Hausdorff group topology on H.\nProof. By [3, Lemma 3.9], there exists an involution f such that N is not Zariski embedded in the\ncountable semidirect product G\u2032 = N \u22ca hf i. (Here hf i denotes the two-element cyclic group generated\nby the involution f .) Since G\u2032 is countable, N is not Markov embedded in G\u2032 by Corollary 1.4. Define\nG1 = G2 = G\u2032 , and let H be the subgroup of G = G1 \u00d7 G2 generated by the element (f, f ) \u2208 G and the\nsubgroup N \u00d7 {1G2 } of G. Note that the projection p1 : G = G1 \u00d7 G2 \u2192 G1 onto the first coordinate\nsends H isomorphically onto G1 = G\u2032 and p1 (G\u2217 ) = N. This proves (i).\nSince N is neither Markov nor Zariski embedded in G\u2032 and p1 sends H isomorphically onto G\u2032 with\np1 (G\u2217 ) = N, it follows from Remark 2.8 that G\u2217 is neither Markov nor Zariski embedded in H. This\nproves (ii).\nTo prove (iii), note that G\u2217 is not Hausdorff embedded in H by item (ii) and Lemma 2.7. Since G\u2217 is\ncountable, by Theorem 2.9 there must exist a metric group topology T \u2217 on G\u2217 that cannot be extended\nto any Hausdorff group topology on H.\n\n3\n\nReflection principle for the Zariski closure operator\n\nIf X is a set, then [X]<\u03c9 and [X]\u2264\u03c9 denote the set of all finite subsets of X and all (at most) countable\nsubsets of X, respectively. N denotes the set of all natural numbers. We need some machinery from set\ntheory useful for carrying out closing off arguments.\nDefinition 3.1. Let C \u2286 [X]\u2264\u03c9 .\n\u2264\u03c9\n(i) C\nS is closed in [X] if, whenever {Cn : n \u2208 N} \u2286 C and C0 \u2286 C1 \u2286 * * * \u2286 Cn \u2286 Cn+1 \u2286 . . . , then\n{Cn : n \u2208 N} \u2208 C,\n\n(ii) C is unbounded in [X]\u2264\u03c9 provided that for every Y \u2208 [X]\u2264\u03c9 there exists C \u2208 C with Y \u2286 C,\n\n(iii) C is a club in [X]\u2264\u03c9 (a common abbreviation for \"closed and unbounded\") if C is both closed and\nunbounded in [X]\u2264\u03c9 .\nFor a group G we define S(G) = {H \u2208 [G]\u2264\u03c9 : H is a subgroup of G}. This is a typical example of a\nclub:\nLemma 3.2. If G is a group, then S(G) is a club in [G]\u2264\u03c9 .\nAs witnessed by (the proof of) the previous lemma, clubs appear naturally in various closing off\narguments, and a general scheme that greatly simplifies carrying out such arguments is given below.\nDefinition 3.3. Given a set X and a function \u03c6 : [X]<\u03c9 \u2192 [X]<\u03c9 , we say that a subset Y of X is\n\u03c6-invariant provided that \u03c6([Y ]<\u03c9 ) \u2286 [Y ]<\u03c9 .\nLemma 3.4. Given a set X and a function \u03c6 : [X]<\u03c9 \u2192 [X]<\u03c9 , the family I(\u03c6) = {Y \u2208 [X]\u2264\u03c9 : Y is\n\u03c6-invariant} is a club in [X]\u2264\u03c9 .\nProof. One can easily check that I(\u03c6) is closed in [X]\u2264\u03c9 . Let us show that I(\u03c6) is also unbounded in\n\u2264\u03c9\n[X]\u2264\u03c9 . Fix arbitrarily\n{Yn : n \u2208 N} \u2286 [X]\u2264\u03c9 by\nS Y \u2208 [X] . By<\u03c9induction on n \u2208 N define a sequence\nS\nY0 = Y and Yn+1 = {\u03c6(Z) : Z \u2208 [Yn ] } \u222a Yn . Finally, note that E = {Yn : n \u2208 N} is \u03c6-invariant and\nY \u2286 E.\n\n\fThe following well-known lemma reveals one of the main reasons why clubs are so useful. We briefly\noutline the proof for the reader's convenience.\nT\nLemma 3.5. If {Cn : n \u2208 N} is a sequence of clubs in [X]\u2264\u03c9 , then C = {Cn : n \u2208 N} is also a club in\n[X]\u2264\u03c9 .\nProof. Clearly, C is closed in [X]\u2264\u03c9 . Let us show that C is also unbounded in [X]\u2264\u03c9 . Fix arbitrarily\nY \u2208 [X]\u2264\u03c9 . Since each Cn is unbounded in [X]\u2264\u03c9 , there exists a function fn : [X]\u2264\u03c9 \u2192 Cn such that\nZ \u2286 fn (Z) for all Z \u2208 [X]\u2264\u03c9 . Fix an enumeration N \u00d7 N = {(kn , mn ) : n \u2208 N} of N \u00d7 N. By induction\non nS\u2208 N define a sequence {Yn : n \u2208 N} \u2286 [X]\u2264\u03c9 by Y0 = Y and Yn+1 = Yn \u222a fkn (Yn ). Then\nC = {Yn : n \u2208 N} \u2208 C and Y \u2286 C.\nLet G be a group.

Clearly, the family {UG (F ) : F \u2208 [FG ]<\u03c9 }\nforms a base of the Zariski topology ZG on G, and the closure\nClZG A = {z \u2208 G : \u2200 F \u2208 [FG ]<\u03c9 (z \u2208 UG (F ) \u2192 A \u2229 UG (F ) 6= \u2205)}\nof a set A \u2286 G in this topology is called the Zariski closure of A in G.\nThe main result of this section is the following general reflection principle for the Zariski closure.\nTheorem 3.6. Let G be a group and A a subset of G. Then the family\nZA = {H \u2208 S(G) : ClZH (H \u2229 A) = H \u2229 ClZG A}\ncontains a club in [G]\u2264\u03c9 .\nProof. For every F \u2208 [FG ]<\u03c9 , if A \u2229 UG (F ) 6= \u2205, pick some\nxF \u2208 A \u2229 UG (F ),\n\n(1)\n\nand define xF = e otherwise. (Here e denotes the identity element of G.)\nFor z \u2208 ClZG A define Fz = \u2205. For z \u2208 G \\ ClZG A, choose Fz \u2208 [FG ]<\u03c9 satisfying\nA \u2229 UG (Fz ) = \u2205 and z \u2208 UG (Fz ).\n\n(2)\n\nDefine functions \u03c6k : [G]<\u03c9 \u2192 [G]<\u03c9 (for every k \u2208 N) and \u03c8 : [G]<\u03c9 \u2192 [G]<\u03c9 by\n)\n(\n[\nn+1\nn+1\n{n} \u00d7 X\n\u00d7 {\u22121, 1}\nF \u2286\n\u03c6k (X) = xF\nn\u2264k\n\nS\nand \u03c8(X) = {S(Fz ) : z \u2208 X} for X \u2208 [G]<\u03c9 .\nT\nAccording to Lemmas 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5, the family H = S(G) \u2229 I(\u03c8) \u2229 k\u2208N I(\u03c6k ) is a club in [G]<\u03c9 .\nIt remains only to show that H \u2286 ZA .\nFix H \u2208 H. We have to check that ClZH (H \u2229 A) = H \u2229 ClZG A. To start with, note that\nUH (F ) = H \u2229 UG (F ) for every F \u2208 [FH ]<\u03c9 .\n\n(3)\n\n\fFirst, let us show that ClZH (H \u2229 A) \u2286 H \u2229 ClZG A. Pick arbitrarily z \u2208 H \\ ClZG A \u2286 G \\ ClZG A. By\nour choice of Fz , (2) holds. Note that S(Fz ) \u2286 \u03c8({z}) \u2208 [H]<\u03c9 because z \u2208 H and H \u2208 I(\u03c8). Therefore,\nS(Fz ) \u2208 [H]<\u03c9 , which in turn yields Fz \u2208 [FH ]<\u03c9 . From (3), (2) and z \u2208 H we get z \u2208 H \u2229 UG (Fz ) =\nUH (Fz ) and (H \u2229 A) \u2229 UH (Fz ) = (H \u2229 A) \u2229 H \u2229 UG (Fz ) \u2286 A \u2229 UG (Fz ) = \u2205. This yields z 6\u2208 ClZH (H \u2229 A).\nSecond, let us prove the inverse inclusion H \u2229 ClZG A \u2286 ClZH (H \u2229 A). Pick arbitrarily z \u2208 H \u2229 ClZG A.\nAssume that F \u2208 [FH ]<\u03c9 and z \u2208 UH (F ). We are going to show that (H \u2229 A) \u2229 UH (F ) 6= \u2205. From z \u2208 H\nand (3) it now follows that z \u2208 UG (F ). From F \u2208 [FH ]<\u03c9 \u2286 [FG ]<\u03c9 and z \u2208 ClZG A we must also have\nA \u2229 UG (F ) 6= \u2205, and thus (1) holds by our choice of xF .\nLet k = max{n \u2208 N : (n, a, \u03b5) \u2208 F }. Then xF \u2208 \u03c6k (S(F )). From F \u2208 [FH ]<\u03c9 , it follows that\nS(F ) \u2208 [H]<\u03c9 . Since H \u2208 I(\u03c6k ), H is \u03c6k -invariant, and thus \u03c6k (S(F )) \u2208 [H]<\u03c9 . We conclude that\nxF \u2208 H. Combining this with (1) and (3), we get\nxF \u2208 H \u2229 (A \u2229 UG (F )) = (H \u2229 A) \u2229 (H \u2229 UG (F )) = (H \u2229 A) \u2229 UH (F ) 6= \u2205.\n\nFrom Theorem 3.6 and Lemma 3.5, we obtain the following\nCorollary 3.7. Let G be a group and A a countable family of subsets of G. Then the family {H \u2208 S(G) :\nClZH (H \u2229 A) = H \u2229 ClZG A for all A \u2208 A} contains a club in [G]\u2264\u03c9 .\nCorollary 3.8. Let G be a group and A a countable family of ZG -closed subsets of G. Then the family\n{H \u2208 S(G) : H \u2229 A is ZH -closed for every A \u2208 A} contains a club in [G]\u2264\u03c9 .\nCorollary 3.9. Assume that G is a group, A a countable family of ZG -closed subsets of G and X is a\ncountable subset of G. Then there exists a countable subgroup H of G containing X such that H \u2229 A is\nZH -closed for each A \u2208 A.\nRemark 3.10. For a reader familiar with the notion of elementary submodels we note in passing that an\nalternative proof of Theorem 3.6 could be furnished using model-theoretic methods. Indeed, the family C\nconsisting of all intersections M \u2229 G, where M is a countable elementary submodel of (sufficiently large\nfragment) of the universe containing (G, *, \u22121) and A, forms a club in [G]\u2264\u03c9 satisfying C \u2286 ZA .\n\n4\n\nCharacterization of groups for which Markov and Zariski\ntopologies coincide\n\nIt turns out that the version of reflection for MG similar to the one for ZG obtained in Theorem 3.6\ncharacterizes groups G for which Markov and Zariski topologies coincide.\nTheorem 4.1. For a group G the following conditions are equivalent:\n(i) MG = ZG ;\n(ii) For every set A \u2286 G, the family\nMA = {H \u2208 S(G) : ClMH (H \u2229 A) = H \u2229 ClMG A}\ncontains a club in [G]\u2264\u03c9 ;\n(iii) For every MG -closed set A \u2286 G, the family EA = {H \u2208 S(G) : H \u2229 A is MH -closed} contains a\nclub in [G]\u2264\u03c9 .\n\n\fProof. (i)\u2192(ii). Let A be a subset of G. Applying Theorem 3.6, we conclude that the family ZA (as\ngiven by Theorem 3.6) contains some club in [G]\u2264\u03c9 . Therefore, it suffices to show that ZA \u2286 MA . Let\nH \u2208 ZA . From (i) and the definition of ZA , we get ClZH (H \u2229 A) = H \u2229 ClZG A = H \u2229 ClMG A. Since H is\ncountable, from Fact 2 it follows that ClMH (H \u2229 A) = ClZH (H \u2229 A) = H \u2229 ClMG A, which yields H \u2208 MA .\n(ii)\u2192(iii) is trivial.\n(iii)\u2192(i). We have to show that every MG -closed set is ZG -closed. Suppose that some MG -closed set A\nis not ZG -closed. Then there exists g \u2208 ClZG A \\ A. Let ZA be the family from the conclusion of Theorem\n3.6. By (ii), Theorem 3.6 and Lemma 3.5, EA \u2229 ZA contains some club C. Since C is unbounded, there\nexists H \u2208 C with g \u2208 H. From H \u2208 EA , it follows that H \u2229A is MH -closed. Since H is a countable group,\nH \u2229 A must also be ZH -closed by Fact 2. Since H \u2208 ZA , we have g \u2208 H \u2229 ClZG A = ClZH (H \u2229 A) = H \u2229 A,\nin contradiction with g 6\u2208 A.\nCorollary 4.2. The equality MG = ZG is completely determined by countable subgroups of G.\nAs an application of Theorem 4.1, we get a new class of groups G for which ZG = MG :\nCorollary 4.3. Let G be a group such that the family NG = {N \u2208 S(G) : N is Markov embedded in G}\ncontains some club in [G]\u2264\u03c9 . Then Markov and Zariski topologies on G coincide.\nProof. Indeed, given MG -closed set A \u2286 G, we have NG \u2286 MA , and the conclusion follows from the\nimplication (iii)\u2192(i) of Theorem 4.1.\nCorollary 4.4. [2] Markov and Zariski topologies coincide for Abelian groups.\nProof. Let H be a subgroup of an Abelian group G. By Corollary 2.3, H is super-normal in G. Hence,\nby Corollary 2.6 and Lemma 2.7, H is Markov embedded in G. We have proved that S(G) \u2286 NG . Now\nthe conclusion of our corollary follows from Lemma 3.2 and Corollary 4.3.\nMarkov [6] has attributed (the equivalent form of) Corollary 4.4 to Perel'man. To the best of our\nknowledge the proof has never appeared in print until [2]. (In the particular case when G is almost\ntorsion-free1 the equality ZG = MG was earlier proved in [12].) In fact, [2] also offers a much stronger\nversion of this result.\nOur next result is a counterpart of Corollary 1.4(a).\nCorollary 4.5. Let H be an Abelian subgroup of a group G. If H is Markov embedded in G, then H is\nalso Zariski embedded in G.\nProof. ZH = MH by Corollary 4.4. Now Lemma 1.2 (a) applies.\nL\nS\nLet {Gi : i \u2208 I} be a family of groups.

While this\nnotation and\ngroup theorists\nL terminology is common in commutative group theory, non-commutative Q\noften\nL call i\u2208I Gi the direct product of the family {Gi : i \u2208 I} and use product notation i\u2208I Gi instead\nof i\u2208I Gi . Since the former notation could easily lead to confusion with Cartesian\nproducts, especially\nL\nQ\namong topologists, we decided to use the \"commutative looking\" notation\nG\ni instead of\ni\u2208I\ni\u2208I Gi\ncommon in non-commutative group theory. However, for a finite family of groups G1 , G2 , . . . , Gn we will\nuse the product notation G1 \u00d7 G2 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Gn instead of G1 \u2295 G2 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Gn .\nOur next lemma exhibits a particular situation when the assumption of Corollary 4.3 holds:\n1\n\nAn Abelian group G is almost torsion-free if G[n] = {g \u2208 G : ng = 0} is finite for every n > 1.\n\n\f\u0001\nL\nLemma 4.6.

The Zariski topology ZG of a group G is discrete if and only if there exist elementary\nalgebraic sets E1 , . . . , En such that E1 \u222a . . . \u222a En = G \\ {eG }.\n\n\fThe problem to construct a (countable) non-topologizable group was raised by Markov and resolved\nconsistently in [9] (see more details in Remark 5.5 (iii)). In [7] Ol\u2032 shanskij used Lemma 5.2(ii) and 5.3\nto produce the first ZFC solution of Markov's problem on the existence of non-topologizable countable\ngroups (Ol\u2032 shanskij used an appropriate quotient of the (countable) Adian group A(n, m)).\nNow we give a sufficient condition (due to Shelah) that ensures that an uncountable group is nontopologizable.\nProposition 5.4. (Shelah) An uncountable group G is non-topologizable whenever the following two\nconditions hold:\n(a) there exists m \u2208 N such that Am = G for every subset A of G with |A| = |G|;\n(b) for every subgroup\nH of G with |H| < |G| there exist n \u2208 N and x1 , . . . , xn \u2208 G such that the\nTn \u22121\nintersection i=1 xi Hxi is finite.\n\nProof. Let T be a Hausdorff group topology on G. There exists a T -neighbourhood V of eG with V 6= G.\nChoose a T -neighbourhood W of eG with W m \u2286 V . Now\nTn V 6=\u22121G and (a) yield |W | < |G|. Let H = hW i.\nThen |H| = |W | * \u03c9 < |G|. By (b) the intersection O = i=1 xi Hxi is finite for some n \u2208 N and elements\nx1 , . . . , xn \u2208 G. Since each x\u22121\ni Hxi is a T -neighbourhood of eG , this proves that eG \u2208 O \u2208 T . Since T is\nHausdorff, it follows that {eG } is T -open, and therefore T is discrete.\nRemark 5.5. (i) Note that in item (b) the number n may depend of H, while in item (a) the number\nm is the same for all A \u2208 [G]|G| . (Indeed, one can easily see that in the circle group G = T,\nwritten additively, every neighbourhood A of 0 in the usual topology satisfies mA = G for some m\ndepending on A.)\n(ii) Even the weaker form of (a) (with m depending on A \u2208 [G]|G| ), yields that every proper subgroup of\nG has size < |G| (in the case |G| = \u03c91 , the groups with this property are known as Kurosh groups,\nthe first consistent example of a Kurosh group was given in [9]).\n(iii) The above criterion was used by Shelah [9] to produce the first consistent example of a nontopologizable group (he worked under the assumption of CH and produced a group G of size \u03c91\nsatisfying (a) with m = 10000 and (b) with n = 2).\nLemma 5.6. (a) If G is non-topologizable, then the Markov embedded subgroups of G are non-topologizable\nas well. In particular, no infinite Abelian subgroup of G is Markov embedded in G. More specifically,\nin a torsion-free non-topologizable group G all cyclic subgroups are not Markov embedded.\n(b) Every non-topologizable group H is Hausdorff embedded (and thus Markov embedded) in any ambient\ngroup G.\nProof. (a) MG is discrete by Lemma 5.2(i). If H is a Markov embedded subgroup of G, then MH = MG \u21beH\nmust be discrete as well. Applying Lemma 5.2(i) once again, we conclude that H is non-topologizable.\n(b) Let H be a non-topologizable subgroup of a group G. If T is a Hausdorff group topology on H,\nthen T must be discrete, and so we can trivially extend T by taking the discrete topology on G.\nLemma 5.7. For a group H the following conditions are equivalent:\n(i) H is Markov embedded in every group G that contains it as a subgroup,\n(ii) H is non-topologizable.\nProof. (i)\u2192(ii). According to [13], H admits an embedding into some non-topologizable group G. Since\nMG is discrete, from (i) we conclude that MH must also be discrete. Hence H is non-topologizable.\n(ii)\u2192(i) follows from Lemma 5.6(b) and Theorem 2.7.\n\n\fRemark 5.8. (i) Lemma 5.7 should be compared to Theorem 6.2. According to Lemma 2.7 for countable groups H Theorem 6.2 along with Corollary 4.5 provides many examples of countable Abelian\ngroups that are Markov embedded in every subgroup where they are embedded as a normal subgroup.\n(ii) According to Lemma 5.7 no infinite Abelian group H can be Markov embedded in every group\ncontaining H as a subgroup (as infinite Abelian groups are topologizable).\nAccording to [5] there exists a countable torsion-free non-topologizable group G. Hence for this group\nno cyclic subgroup C is Markov embedded into G by Lemma 5.6. The next proposition yields that none\nof them is a normal subgroup of G.\nProposition 5.9. If a group G has an infinite cyclic subgroup as a normal subgroup, then G is topologizable.\nProof. Assume H is an infinite normal cyclic subgroup of G. Then H is Hausdorff embedded in G by\nCorollary 2.5. So H is Markov embedded in G as well (Lemma 2.7). Since MH is non-discrete, it follows\nthat MG is non-discrete as well. Hence G is topologizable.\nLemma 5.10. Let G be a countable group for which the Zariski topology ZG is not discrete. Then G is\ntopologizable.\nProof. Since ZG = MG by Fact 2, from our assumption it follows that MG is not discrete. Now apply\nLemma 5.2(i).\nCorollary 5.11. Let G be an infinite countable group such that ZG is compact. Then G is topologizable.\nProof. An infinite compact space cannot be discrete, and the result follows from Lemma 5.10.\nRemark 5.12. (i) According to Remark 1.3, item (b) of Lemma 1.2 has the following stronger (but\nnon-symmetric) form: (b\u2217 ) If ZG = MG and H is Zariski embedded in G, then H is also Markov\nembedded in G and ZH = MH .\n(ii) According to [10] there exists a countable non-topologizable subgroup H of a non-topologizable\ngroup G with MG 6= ZG . Then MH is the discrete topology of H, thus H is Markov embedded in\nG by item (b) of Example 5.6. Since H is countable, ZH = MH (Fact 2), and so the topology ZH\nis discrete. Therefore, H is also Zariski embedded in G by item (a) of Lemma 1.4. We see that H\nis both Markov and Zariski embedded in G, and yet ZG 6= MG . Therefore, the stronger form (a\u2217 )\nof item (a) of Lemma 1.2 obtained by adding the condition ZG = MG to the conclusion of (a) may\nfail.\n(iii) Item (i) and Remark 1.3 explain why we preferred to announce Lemma 1.2 in its present form that\ngives a pleasing symmetry between items (a) and (b) of this lemma.\n\n6\n\nAbsolutely Hausdorff embeddings and a gap in [11]\n\nRecall that an Abelian group G is called indecomposable if for every direct product decomposition G =\nG\u2032 \u00d7 G\u2032\u2032 either G\u2032 = {0} or G\u2032\u2032 = {0}.\nDefinition 6.1. [3] A group G is called:\n(a) absolutely Hausdorff embedded provided that G is Hausdorff embedded in every group H containing\nG as a normal subgroup.\n\n\f(b) absolutely Zariski embedded provided that G is Zariski embedded in every group H containing G\nas a normal subgroup.\nBy Lemma 2.7 and Corollary 4.5 every absolutely Hausdorff embedded Abelian group is also absolutely\nZariski embedded. Even if the latter property may seem weaker, one can show that it imposes a very\nstrong restraint on the structure of an Abelian group.\nTheorem 6.2. [3] Every absolutely Zariski embedded (in particular, every absolutely Hausdorff embedded)\nAbelian group is indecomposable.\nRemark 6.3. Let H be a decomposable Abelian group. By Theorem 6.2, there exists a group G\ncontaining H as a (normal) subgroup such that H is not Zariski embedded in G. By Corollary 4.5, H is\nnot Markov embedded in G either.\nThe next characterization obtained in [3] shows, among other things, that divisible Abelian groups are\nnever absolutely Hausdorff embedded:\nTheorem 6.4. [3] An Abelian group G is absolutely Hausdorff embedded if and only if the identity map\nidG of G and minus the identity map \u2212idG of G are the only automorphisms of G.\nQ\nIn [11] the author takes a subgroup H of a direct product G = \u03b1\u2208I G\u03b1 of countable\nQ groups G\u03b1 , then\nfinds a countable set I \u2217 \u2286 I and considers the countable normal subgroup G\u2217 = H \u2229 \u03b1\u2208I G\u2217\u03b1 of H, where\nG\u2217\u03b1 = G\u03b1 for \u03b1 \u2208 I \u2217 and G\u2217\u03b1 = {1\u03b1 } for \u03b1 \u2208 I \\ I \u2217 . (Here 1\u03b1 denotes the identity element of G\u03b1 .) Then\na metric group topology T \u2217 on G\u2217 is constructed, and the author says: \"Since G\u2217 is a normal subgroup\nof H, the neighbourhoods of the identity in the topology T \u2217 form a neighbourhood base of the identity of\nsome group topology T on H.\" The author than employs this topology T on Q\nH to finish the proof of\nthe main result of [11]: MH = ZH for such\nan\nH.\n(Apparently,\nthe\nproduct\n\u03b1\u2208I G\u03b1 in the author's\nL\nterminology is what we call a direct sum \u03b1\u2208I G\u03b1 .)\nThe italicized statement above is an essential gap in the proof of the main result of [11], and so the\nresult itself should be considered an unsolved open problem (see our Question 7.1). Indeed, for this proof\nto work one has to extend a Hausdorff group topology T \u2217 on G\u2217 to some Hausdorff group topology T\non a bigger group H containing G\u2217 as a normal subgroup. Since a priori there is no control whatsoever\neither over the topology T \u2217 on G\u2217 or the ambient group H this appears impossible unless the group G\u2217\nin question is Hausdorff embedded in every group H containing G\u2217 as a normal subgroup. That is, G\u2217\napparently must be absolutely Hausdorff embedded. Indeed, our next lemma clearly demonstrates the\ninherent non-triviality of this extension problem.\nLemma 6.5. Let G\u2217 be a countable group that is not absolutely Hausdorff embedded. Then there exists a\ngroup H \u2217 containing G\u2217 as a normal subgroup of countable index and a metric group topology T \u2217 on G\u2217\nthat cannot be extended to any Hausdorff group topology on H \u2217 .\nProof. Indeed, by our assumption and a result from [3] there exists a group H \u2217 containing G\u2217 as a normal\nsubgroup of countable index such that G\u2217 is not Hausdorff embedded in H \u2217 . By Theorem 2.9, there must\nexist a metric group topology T \u2217 on G\u2217 that cannot be extended to any Hausdorff group topology on\nH \u2217.\nFrom this lemma we ought to conclude that the proof of the main result of [11] could possibly work\nonly in the case when G\u2217 is absolutely Hausdorff embedded. The class of (countable) absolutely Hausdorff\nembedded groups is extremely narrow. Indeed, according to Theorems 6.4 and 6.2, an Abelian absolutely\nHausdorff embedded group G\u2217 must be indecomposable and every automorphism of G\u2217 must be either\nthe identity map of G\u2217 or minus the identity map of G\u2217 .\nA persistent reader might still feel that there are yet additional circumstances in the setting of [11]\nthat are not accounted for in Lemma 6.5. Indeed, the group G\u2217 in question appears to be \"nicely\n\n\fembedded\" in the direct product. However, Lemma 2.12 demonstrates that this is a mere illusion. From\nthis lemma one has to conclude the following: Given a subgroup H of the square G\u2032 \u00d7 G\u2032 of a countable\ngroup G\u2032 , one cannot reasonably expect to be able to extend a metric group topology from the (normal)\nsubgroup G\u2217 = H \u2229 (G\u2032 \u00d7 {1G\u2032 }) of H to any Hausdorff group topology on H unless G\u2217 does not admit\na decomposition G\u2217 = G1 \u00d7 G2 such that both groups G1 and G2 are infinite. Moreover, if G\u2217 has such\na decomposition, then G\u2217 may even fail to be both Markov embedded in H and Zariski embedded in H.\n\n7\n\nFinal remarks and open questions\n\nLet MZ be the class of groups G for which Markov and Zariski topologies coincide: MG = ZG .\nIt might be tempting to generalize Corollary 4.8 even further:\nQuestion 7.1. Let G be a subgroup of a direct sum of countable groups. Does G belong to MZ?\nAn attempt of providing a positive answer to this question has been recently made in [11] but the\nproof contains essential errors that were pointed out in Section 6.\nSince every Abelian group is a subgroup of a direct sum of countable groups, a positive answer to\nQuestion 7.1 would yield that Corollaries 4.7 and 4.8 are equivalent. A rather limited partial positive\nanswer to Question 7.1 can be found in Lemma 4.9.\nQuestion 7.2.\n\n(i) Is MZ closed under finite direct sums?\n\n(ii) Is MZ closed under arbitrary direct sums?\nQuestion 7.3. Let H be an Abelian subgroup of G.\n(i) If index of H in G is finite, does G belong to MZ?\n(ii) If index of H in G is countable, does G belong to MZ?\nWhat is the answer to both items (i) and (ii) if one additionally assumes that H is a normal subgroup of\nG?\nAs witnessed by Lemma 1.2, the following question is ultimately related to the Markov's problem:\nQuestion 7.4. Let H be a (normal) subgroup of a group G.\n(i) If H is Markov embedded in G, must H also be Zariski embedded in G?\n(ii) If H is Zariski embedded in G, must it also be Markov embedded in G?\nOur next two questions should be compared with Lemma 5.7.\nQuestion 7.5. Describe the class of groups G such that G is Markov embedded in every group that\ncontains G as a normal subgroup.\nNote that an Abelian group G with the above property must be absolutely Zariski embedded by\nCorollary 4.5, hence G must be indecomposable by Theorem 6.2.\nQuestion 7.6. Let H be a group that is Zariski embedded in every group G containing H as a subgroup.\nMust H be non-topologizable?\nLet {Gi : i \u2208 I} be a family of groups,\nand for every i \u2208 I, let Hi be a Hausdorff embedded subgroup\nQ\nof\nproduct\nQ Gi . Then the Cartesian productL i\u2208I Hi is a Hausdorff embedded subgroup of the CartesianL\ni\u2208I Gi . Similarly, the direct sum\ni\u2208I Hi is a Hausdorff embedded subgroup of the direct sum\ni\u2208I Gi .\nIn other words, the class H of Hausdorff embeddings is closed under both Cartesian products and direct\nsums. We do not know whether the remaining two classes M of Markov embeddings and Z of Zariski\nembeddings are closed under taking Cartesian products and direct sums. In fact, even in the weakest\npossible form, this is an open question:\n\n\fQuestion 7.7. Assume H1 is Markov (Zariski) embedded in G1 . Is it true that for every group G2 the\nsubgroup H1 \u00d7 G2 of G = G1 \u00d7 G2 is Markov (Zariski) embedded in G?\nRemark 7.8. If Question 7.7 has a positive answer in the particular case when H1 is a Zariski embedded\nsubgroup of an Abelian group G1 , then the more general Corollary 4.7 would follow from the less general\nCorollary 4.8. Indeed, let D be any divisible Abelian group containing N (for example, the divisible hull\n\u0001\ne = D \u00d7 L Gi\nof N). Then D is a direct sum of countable groups [4]. Therefore, for the group G\ni\u2208I\none has MGe = ZGe by Corollary 4.8. Since D is Abelian, N is super-normal in D (Corollary 2.3), and\nthus N is Markov embedded in D by Corollary 2.6 and Lemma 2.7. By Corollary 4.5, N is also Zariski\nembedded in D. According to the presumed positive answer of Question 7.7 in this case, G now becomes\ne Since M e = Z e , Remark 1.3 would finally yield MG = ZG .\nZariski embedded in G.\nG\nG\n\nReferences\n\n[1] R.
