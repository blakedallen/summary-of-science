We\nhave compared our model results with the G-dwarf metallicity distribution, the amounts of gas, stars,\nstellar remnants, infall rate and SN rate in the solar vicinity, and with the radial abundance gradients\nand gas distribution in the disk. This comparison strongly suggests that the value of \u03a3(R\u2299 , tGal ) which\nbest fits the observational properties should lie in the range 50 \u2013 75 M\u2299 pc\u22122 , and that values of the\ntotal disk mass surface density outside this range should be ruled out.\nSubject headings: Galaxy: evolution - Galaxy: stellar content - Galaxy: structure - dark matter\ndynamical estimates of the local column density.\nFitting the Galaxy rotation curve (RC) with a mass\nmodel provides a further way of estimating the local column density of disk matter \u03a3V . In fact, such a fit indicates what is the fraction \u03b2 2 of the circular velocity due\nto the disk component (at the Sun's position). Then,\n\u03b2 V\u22992 is compared with the circular velocity of an expo2\n= G\u22121 \u03a3V RD f (R\u2299 /RD ), with f\nnential thin disk, Vdisk\na known function of the Galactocentric distance of the\nSun expressed in terms of disk length scales (see Freeman\n1970), to yield \u03a3V , providing that R\u2299 and RD are known.\nThe results are far from unique, and reflect the presence\nof uncertainties in the mass modelling, in the actual shape\nof the Galactic RC, and in the basic structural parameters. The values found range between \u03a3V \u223c 50 M\u2299 pc\u22122\nand \u223c 100 M\u2299 pc\u22122 (Olling & Merrifield 1998; Dehnen\n& Binney 1998), and moreover include any dark matter\ndistributed like the stellar disk. In external galaxies of luminosity similar to the Galaxy (LB \u223c 1011 L\u2299 ), values of\n\u03a3V as high as \u2243 90 M\u2299 pc\u22122 at R = 8 kpc cannot be\nruled out (Persic, Salucci, & Stel 1996).\nFinally, let us note that if the dark matter halo in the\nGalaxy follows the standard cold dark matter (CDM) universal density profile (Navarro, Frenk, & White 1997), and\ntherefore at the Sun position \u03c1SCDM \u221d R\u22122 , then the local disk column density is required to be towards the low\nend of the above-cited values (e.g. Courteau & Rix 1999).\nOn the other hand, low-\u03a9 CDM density profiles are not inconsistent with a baryon dominated region inside R\u2299 , and\nthen with much higher values for the local disk column\ndensity (Navarro 1998).\nSummarizing: all the above observations, often entangled with heavy theoretical assumptions, poorly constrain\nthe value of the column density of the baryonic matter in\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nDespite a number of estimates, obtained by means of\nseveral different methods, the value of the local column\ndensity of the Galactic disk in stars and gas, \u03a3b (R\u2299 \u2243\n8 kpc) = \u03a3stars + \u03a3gas , has been until recently very uncertain. Direct HST star counts imply a stellar column\ndensity of \u2243 27 M\u2299 pc\u22122 (Flynn, Gould, & Bahcall 1999),\nwhile the (H I + H2 ) column density amounts to 7 \u2013 13\nM\u2299 pc\u22122 (Dickey 1993; Flynn et al. 1999). Therefore,\nthe surface density of the directly seen baryonic matter\namounts to 35 \u2013 40 M\u2299 pc\u22122 . However, the actual column\ndensity of the \"luminous\" disk could be higher because the\nabove detection does not account for dead stars and brown\ndwarfs.\nThe total disk surface density \u03a3z (R\u2299 ), including also\nany eventual disk dark matter component, can be determined from the motion of stars in the solar neighborhood perpendicular to the Galactic plane (e.g. Binney\n& Tremaine 1987; Gilmore, Wyse, & Kuijken 1989). From\nthe kinematics of a sample of K-giants Bahcall, Flynn, &\n\u22122\nGould (1992) derived \u03a3z (R\u2299 ) = 84+30\n(at 1 \u03c3\n\u221225 M\u2299 pc\nlevel). Notice that such a measure is a complex one and it\nis strongly dependent on the underlying assumptions. By\nemploying different samples and/or analysis, lower values\nfor \u03a3z (R\u2299 ) have been claimed: \u03a3z (R\u2299 ) = 46 \u00b1 9 M\u2299\npc\u22122 (Kuijken & Gilmore 1989) - revised to 48 \u00b1 9 M\u2299\npc\u22122 (Kuijken & Gilmore 1991), \u03a3z (R\u2299 ) = 52 \u00b1 13 M\u2299\npc\u22122 (Flynn & Fuchs 1994). The local column density\nof stars and gas could be smaller, because these dynamical estimates may include some non-baryonic matter. Notice however that it is quite unlikely that there is nonbaryonic matter in the disk, because non-baryonic dark\nmatter is probably non dissipational. Any non-baryonic\nmatter present in the disk is likely to be part of the dark\nhalo, and this component is always subtracted from the\n1 Dipartimento\n2 It\n\ndi Astronomia, Universit\u00e0 di Trieste, via G.B. Tiepolo 11, I-34131 Trieste, Italy; matteucci@ts.astro.it\nshould be noted that the value for \u03b2 depends on the assumed profiles for the disk and the halo.\n\n1\n\n\f2\nthe local disk, that may lie between 35 and 100 M\u2299 pc\u22122 .\nHowever, very recently the results of the European\nSpace Agency's Hipparcos mission have allowed a drastical reduction of this permitted range, by making available\ndirect distances for the tracer stars. In particular, Cr\u00e9z\u00e9\net al. (1998) and Holmberg & Flynn (1998) have analyzed\nthe A and F stars in the Hipparcos data set (some 10,000\nstars) and derived greatly improved estimates of the total\ngravitating mass: the gravitating disk mass seems to be\nnow firmly established at 50 to 60 M\u2299 pc\u22122 .\nIn this paper we investigate how the gravitating mass of\nthe disk influences the Galactic chemical evolution. Successful models for the chemical evolution of the Galaxy,\nin fact, require a star formation law depending on the total mass surface density (Tosi 1988; Matteucci & Fran\u00e7ois\n1989; Chiappini, Matteucci, & Gratton 1997), and the star\nformation rate (SFR) is a fundamental parameter in the\nevolution of galaxies.\n2. THE CHEMICAL EVOLUTION MODEL\n\nWe adopt the two-infall chemical evolution model of\nChiappini et al. (1997), to which we refer for an exhaustive\nexplanation of the main assumptions and basic equations.\nHere we just review the features of the model most directly\nrelated to the aspects discussed in the present study.\nBriefly, the overall evolutionary scenario is the following: it is assumed that the Galaxy formed out of two main\ninfall episodes; during the first episode, the primordial gas\ncollapsed very quickly and formed the spheroidal components (halo and bulge); during the second episode, the\nthin disk formed almost independently of the previous infall episode, mainly out of material of primordial chemical\ncomposition. The disk formation process is assumed to\nbe slower with increasing Galactocentric distance (Larson\n1976; Matteucci & Fran\u00e7ois 1989); this \"inside-out\" formation of the Galactic disk is required to reproduce the abundance gradients and the gas distribution along the disk. A\nhiatus in the star formation between thick disk and thin\ndisk phases, as suggested by recent observations (Gratton et al. 1996; Bernkopf & Fuhrmann 1998; Fuhrmann\n1998; Carraro 2000), is naturally produced by the model\nunder the assumption that the star formation stops when\nthe gas surface density drops below a threshold of 7 M\u2299\npc\u22122 (Kennicutt 1989). Moreover, the presence of such a\nthreshold predicts a roughly constant gas density profile\nat the outer radii (between 8 and 14 kpc) in agreement\nwith observations (Dame 1993). We will focus on the thin\ndisk formation process.\nThe most relevant quantities in the present discussion\nare the infall rate and the SFR, since they involve the total\nmass surface density profile. The rate at which the thin\ndisk is formed out of external matter (although it has also\nsome initial contribution from the halo gas) is:\nd\u03a3I (R, t)\n= B(R) e\u2212(t\u2212tmax )/\u03c4D ,\ndt\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03a3I (R, t) is the gas surface density of the infalling\nmaterial, which has a primordial chemical composition;\ntmax is the time of maximum gas accretion onto the disk,\ncoincident with the end of the halo-thick disk phase which\nis set equal to 1 Gyr; \u03c4D is the timescale for mass accretion onto the thin disk component. We assume that \u03c4D\n\nincreases with increasing the Galactic radius:\n\u03c4D (R) = 1.033 \u00d7 R \u2212 1.267.\n\n(2)\n\nThis relation derives from the fact that in order to fit the\nG-dwarf metallicity distribution in the solar neighborhood\nit is necessary to assume \u03c4D = 7 Gyr, whereas to reproduce the metallicity distribution of the stars in the Galactic bulge (R = 2 kpc) a timescale \u03c4D = 0.8 Gyr is required\n(Matteucci, Romano, & Molaro 1999). It should be emphasized that this choice also guarantees a good fit to the\ngas density profile and to the Galactic abundance gradients. The quantity B(R) is derived from the condition of\nreproducing the current total mass surface density distribution along the disk:\nB(R) =\n\n\u03a3(R, tGal )\n\u0011.\n\u0010\n\u03c4D (R) 1 \u2212 e\u2212(tGal \u2212tmax )/\u03c4D (R)\n\n(3)\n\ntGal = 15 Gyr is the age of the Galaxy starting with the\nformation of the halo. From equation (3) it is clear the\nstrong dependence of the infall rate from the total mass\ndensity profile.\nObservations in our own and in other disk galaxies allow us to relate the SFR to intrinsic parameters of galaxies, in particular to the average surface gas density: SFR\n\u221d \u03a3kgas (Schmidt 1959), where the exponent is reasonably well known (e.g. k = 1.4 \u00b1 0.15 - Kennicutt 1998).\nMoreover, the correlation between metallicity and surface\nbrightness noted for late type spirals (McCall 1982; Edmunds & Pagel 1984; Dopita & Ryder 1994) is consistent\nwith theories of self-regulated star formation, in which the\nenergy produced by young stars and SNe feeds back into\nthe ISM and inhibits further star formation by producing\nan expansion of the region surrounding the new stars or the\nSN remnants, thus relating the SFR to the gravitational\npotential and therefore to the total mass surface density.\nIn addition, according to the most popular prescriptions,\none of the key conditions for star formation to occur is\ntcooling << tf f ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere tcooling is the cooling timescale and tf f is the freefall timescale (Katz 1992; Navarro & White 1993; Carraro,\nLia, & Chiosi 1998); tf f \u221d \u03c1\u22121/2 , where \u03c1 is the total mass\ndensity (Buonomo et al. 1999). Again, in some way the\nSFR is related to the potential well and therefore to the\ntotal mass surface density. The SFR adopted here is the\nsame as in Chiappini et al.

Note that the gas surface density exponent, k,\nequal to 1.5, was obtained from the best model of Chiappini et al. (1997) in order to ensure a good fit to the\nobservational constraints at the solar vicinity. This value\nis in good agreement with the recent observational results\nof Kennicutt (1998) and with N-body simulation results\nby Gerritsen & Icke (1997).\nAs far as our present model is concerned, we stress that\nthe SFR along the Galactic disk, and hence the evolutionary history of the Galactic disk itself, is fixed by the specific\nvalue of the local column density of disk matter that we\nadopt. In fact, the total disk mass surface density profile,\nan exponential with scale length RD , can be expressed as:\n\u03a3(R, tGal ) = \u03a3(R\u2299 , tGal ) * e\u2212(R\u2212R\u2299 )/RD ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhich relates the column density at a radius R to the column density at the Solar position. For the purpose of this\npaper, we let the local mass surface density value to vary\nfrom 35 to 100 M\u2299 pc\u22122 and we set R\u2299 = 8 kpc.\nFinally, the stellar nucleosynthesis prescriptions we\nadopt are from:\n- van den Hoek & Groenewegen (1997) for lowintermediate mass stars (0.8 \u2013 8 M\u2299 ) (their case with\nvariable \u03b7AGB );\n- Charbonnel & do Nascimento (1998) for 3 He production/destruction in low-mass stars (M < 2 M\u2299 );\n- Woosley & Weaver (1995) for Type II SNe (M > 10\nM\u2299 );\n- Thielemann, Nomoto, & Hashimoto (1993) for Type\nIa SNe (exploding white dwarfs in binary systems as\ndescribed in Matteucci & Greggio 1986);\n- Jos\u00e9 & Hernanz (1998) for classical novae.\nOur prescriptions differ from those of Chiappini et\nal. (1997) in: i) the range of low-intermediate masses (0.8 \u2013\n8 M\u2299 ), where they adopted the Renzini & Voli (1981)\n\nyields; ii) the fact that we are including the explosive nucleosynthesis from nova outbursts (Romano et al. 1999;\nRomano & Matteucci 2000); iii) using extra-mixing prescriptions for the 3 He nucleosynthesis (Chiappini & Matteucci 2000) and iv) the Sun position, now taken as 8 kpc\ninstead of 10 kpc.\nAs far as the composition of the infalling material is concerned, we set YP = 0.245 rather than 0.23 (where YP is\nthe primordial mass fraction in form of 4 He), according to\na recent estimate of the pristine 4 He abundance obtained\nas a weighted mean of the 4 He mass fractions from the two\nmost metal-deficient blue compact galaxies, corrected for\nthe stellar contribution (YP = 0.245 \u00b1 0.002 - Izotov et\nal. 19993). The primordial abundances by mass of deuterium and helium-3 are DP = 4.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 and 3 HeP = 4.0\n\u00d7 10\u22125 , respectively. The adopted IMF is that of Scalo\n(1986).\n\n3. MODEL PREDICTIONS\n\n3.1. The Solar Circle\nIn Tables 1 and 2 the model predictions together with\nthe corresponding observed quantities are shown. Different models have identical parameters apart from the value\nof \u03a3(R\u2299 ).\nFrom an inspection of Table 1, we see that there are not\nbig differences among the quantities predicted by the different models, with the exception of the surface densities\nof live stars and stellar remnants, which seem to exclude\nthe models with the highest total disk mass surface densities (80 \u2013 100 M\u2299 pc\u22122 ). The lowest density value (35 M\u2299\npc\u22122 ) predicts a stellar density which is only in marginal\nagreement with the observed one.\nThe predictions on the abundances of the interstellar\nmedium at the time of the Sun's formation are independent of the chosen total disk mass surface density but depend on all other model assumptions, in particular on the\nassumed stellar yields. Therefore, since we adopted a set\nof new yields relative to Chiappini et al. (1997), a comparison between our results for \u03a3 = 54 M\u2299 pc\u22122 and those\n\n3 Ionization corrections for low-metallicity H II regions suggest that this estimate should be reduced to Y\nP = 0.241 \u00b1 0.002 (Viegas,\nGruenwald, & Steigman 1999).\n\n\f4\nTable 2\nTheoretical solar abundances (mass fraction) are compared to the observed ones (Anders & Grevesse 1989).\nXi\nH\nD\n3\nHe\n4\nHe\n7\nLi\n12\nC\n13\nC\n14\nN\n16\nO\n20\nNe\n24\nMg\nSi\nS\nCa\nFe\nCu\nZn\nZ\n\nThis paper\n0.710\n3.231 \u00d7 10\u22125\n3.277 \u00d7 10\u22125\n0.273\n8.740 \u00d7 10\u22129\n3.920 \u00d7 10\u22123\n5.215 \u00d7 10\u22125\n1.670 \u00d7 10\u22123\n7.378 \u00d7 10\u22123\n9.729 \u00d7 10\u22124\n2.563 \u00d7 10\u22124\n7.348 \u00d7 10\u22124\n3.220 \u00d7 10\u22124\n4.145 \u00d7 10\u22125\n1.467 \u00d7 10\u22123\n8.920 \u00d7 10\u22127\n2.635 \u00d7 10\u22126\n1.700 \u00d7 10\u22122\n\nChiappini et al. 1997\n0.731\n4.630 \u00d7 10\u22125\n10.01 \u00d7 10\u22125\n0.255\n...\n1.827 \u00d7 10\u22123\n4.758 \u00d7 10\u22125\n1.386 \u00d7 10\u22123\n7.278 \u00d7 10\u22123\n9.42 \u00d7 10\u22124\n2.48 \u00d7 10\u22124\n7.03 \u00d7 10\u22124\n3.071 \u00d7 10\u22124\n3.95 \u00d7 10\u22125\n1.37 \u00d7 10\u22123\n8.18 \u00d7 10\u22127\n2.44 \u00d7 10\u22126\n1.433 \u00d7 10\u22122\n\nof Chiappini et al. (1997) is required. Table 2 shows that\nthe largest differences in the predicted solar abundances\narise for D, 3 He, 12 C, and 13 C. The improvement in the\npredicted solar abundance for 12 C and 13 C is due to the\nfact that we adopt the new nucleosynthetic yields from van\nden Hoek & Groenewegen (1997) for low and intermediate mass stars, whereas the improvement in the predicted\nsolar abundances for D and 3 He is due to the fact that we\ntake into account that 93% of evolved stars undergo the\nextra-mixing on the RGB and thus destroy, at least partly,\ntheir 3 He (Charbonnel & do Nascimento 1998).\nOne of the most severe observational constraints to\nchemical evolution models is the relative number of stars\nformed at a given time, i.e. at a given metallicity. In Fig.1\nwe compare the predicted and observed G-dwarf metallicity distributions; in particular, we show the results of\nmodels in which \u03a3(R\u2299 , tGal ) is taken to be 20, 54 and 100\nM\u2299 pc\u22122 , respectively. Models with \u03a3 = 35 and 80 M\u2299\npc\u22122 have also been computed. They produce theoretical\nG-dwarf distributions very similar to those obtained with\n\u03a3 = 54 or 100 M\u2299 pc\u22122 , so we do not show them here.\nFrom an inspection of Fig.1 we see that the case \u03a3 = 20\nM\u2299 pc\u22122 is in trouble in reproducing the high metallicity\ntail of the distribution while overestimating the number of\nlow metallicity stars, whereas all the cases with \u03a3 lying\nbetween 35 and 100 M\u2299 pc\u22122 lead to a better agreement\nwith the observations. We performed a \u03c72 test and obtained the following results: \u03c72 = 0.11 for the case \u03a3 =\n20 M\u2299 pc\u22122 , \u03c72 = 0.04 for the cases \u03a3 = 54 and 100 M\u2299\npc\u22122 . We conclude that the observed differential metallicity distribution is not a useful tool to distinguish among\nrealistic values for the total baryonic mass density in the\nlocal disk. This is not surprising since the G-dwarf metallicity distribution depends mostly on the assumed law for\nthe disk formation (i.e. on the assumed infall timescale).\nFig.2 illustrates the different temporal behaviour of\nthe SFR under different choices of \u03a3.

On the other hand, in the\ncase of a very high \u03a3 the star formation process is not\nable to consume enough gas to go below the threshold. This explains why the highest \u03a3 values produce\nthe high stellar and remnant densities listed in Table 1.\nIn a recent paper Rocha-Pinto et al.

The earliest episode of enhanced star formation should reflect\nthe beginning of the solar vicinity formation (and probably corresponds to our maximum infall time). The other\ntwo episodes could be related to cyclical mechanisms (for\ninstance, tidal interactions between the Galaxy and the\nMagellanic Clouds, or even induced star formation by spiral arms). As already explained, the theoretical G-dwarf\nmetallicity distribution is mainly dependent on the assumed timescale for the formation of the solar vicinity,\nhence it would not be too much affected by recent bursts\nof star formation.\nThe elemental abundance ratios as a function of metallicity are nearly independent of the adopted \u03a3 value, depending mostly on the nucleosynthetic yields and the initial mass function. Therefore we do not discuss them here.\n3.2. Radial Profiles\nHere we discuss the predicted radial properties, in order to investigate the model behaviour along the overall\nGalactic disk under different prescriptions on the value of\n\u03a3(R\u2299 ).\nWe assume that the radial surface density distribution of the disk is exponential (see Sect.2, equation (6)),\nand run models assuming different values for the exponential scale length, RD . Fig.3 shows the radial distribution of the present day surface gas density as predicted by models adopting RD = 2.5, 3.5, and 4.5 kpc\n(dashed, solid, and dotted lines, respectively), for different \u03a3 values. The model predictions are compared with\nthe observed gas distribution derived by Dame (1993).\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nFig. 3.- Radial distribution of the present day surface gas density as predicted by models with RD = 2.5 (upper panel ), RD =\n3.5 (middle panel ), and RD = 4.5 (lower panel ). From bottom to\ntop, for each of these panels: lines referring to \u03a3(R\u2299 , tGal ) = 35, 54,\n80, and 100 M\u2299 pc\u22122 (dotted, continuous, long-dashed, and shortdashed lines, respectively). The observed (H I + H2 ) distribution\nis taken from Dame (1993). The surface density distribution of the\ntotal gas \u03a3gas is obtained from the sum of the H I and H2 distributions, \u03a3HI + \u03a3H2 , accounting for the helium and heavy elements\nfractions (thick line).\n\nAll our models predict a flattening of the distribution at\nradii larger than 10 kpc, due to the presence of the threshold star formation density. Models with \u03a3 = 35 M\u2299 pc\u22122\ngive a flat gas distribution already at the smallest radii; on\nthe contrary, models with \u03a3 = 100 M\u2299 pc\u22122 produce very\nsteep distributions, hardly compatible with observations.\nAll models predict that the gas content increases toward\nthe Galactic center, whereas the observations clearly show\na decreasing trend below 5 kpc. This problem could be\nsolved by including the Galactic bar (e.g. Portinari &\nChiosi 2000), not present in the model. Taking into account these uncertainties we can conclude that the best\ngas distribution is obtained for local values of the total\nmass surface density in the range 50 \u2013 75 M\u2299 pc\u22122 .\nWe also notice how increasing the disk scale length from\n2.5 to 4.5 leads to a flattening in the predicted distribution.\nThis behaviour is also observed in the case of the predicted\nradial density distributions of stars4 , stellar remnants, and\nin the case of the predicted abundance gradients. In particular, higher total mass densities and larger scale lengths\ntend to flatten the gradients in the external regions of the\ndisk. The actual situation is still controversial, with observations partly supporting this flattening (V\u0131\u0301lchez & Esteban 1996; Maciel & Quireza 1999) and partly not (Afflerbach, Churchwell, & Werner 1997; Smartt & Rolleston\n1997; Rudolph et al. 1997). Therefore we can not draw\nany firm conclusion on this point.\n\n4 A scale length value of 3.5 kpc is the preferred one, being able to produce a final stellar density scale length in agreement with the observed\none (2.5 \u2013 3.0 kpc - Sackett 1997; Freudenreich 1998).\n\n\f6\n4. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe used a detailed model of galactic chemical evolution\napplied to our own galaxy in order to put constraints on\nthe total amount of disk baryonic matter. Observational\nestimates of this quantity in the local disk span a wide\nrange of values (from 35 to 100 M\u2299 pc\u22122 ), depending on\nthe underlying theoretical assumptions and on the adopted\nmethods. We show that by means of chemical evolution\nmodels it is possible to substantially restrict the observed\nrange of the total mass surface density.\nWe show that the value of \u03a3(R\u2299 ) should be restricted to\nthe range 50 \u2013 75 M\u2299 pc\u22122 , in order to guarantee the best\nfit to all the observational constraints available for the solar neighborhood and the overall Galactic disk. This is well\nconsistent with the mass range which Cr\u00e9z\u00e9 et al. (1998)\n\nand Holmberg & Flynn (1998) advocate from their analysis of A and F stars with parallaxes and proper motions\nfrom the Hipparcos satellite.\nWe would like to thank Dennis W.
