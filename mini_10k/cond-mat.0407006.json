In a magnetic wire with submicron-width, the magnetization\nis restricted to be parallel to the wire axis due to the magnetic shape\nanisotropy, and the magnetization reversal takes place by nucleation and\npropagation of a magnetic domain wall (DW). Therefore, the magnetic wire\nis a simple model system to investigate the propagation of a magnetic DW.\nSeveral attempts have been reported to control nucleation and propagation\nof a DW.1-5\nIn this letter, we present a study on the propagation of a magnetic\nDW in a submicron magnetic wire with asymmetric notches. The\npropagation\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nDW\n\nwas\n\ndetected\n\nby\n\nutilizing\n\nthe\n\ngiant\n\nmagnetoresistance effect2. We show that the depinning field of the DW\nfrom the asymmetric notch depends on the propagation direction of the DW.\nWe also show that the DW moves notch by notch by applying a pulsed\nlocal magnetic field.\nThe samples were fabricated onto thermally oxidized Si substrates\nby means of e-beam lithography and lift-off method. Figure 1 shows a\nschematic illustration of a top view of the whole sample. A magnetic wire\nhas\n\na\n\ntrilayered\n\nstructure\n\nconsisting\n\nof\n\nNi81Fe19(5\n\nnm)/Cu(20\n\nnm)/Ni81Fe19(20 nm). The main body of the magnetic wire has four notches\nwith asymmetric shape. The sample has four current-voltage probes made\nof nonmagnetic material, Cu. Further, it has two narrow Cu wires crossing\nthe ends of the magnetic wire and a wide Cu wire covering the notched part\n\n3\n\n\fof the magnetic wire. These Cu wires are electrically insulated from the\nmagnetic wire by SiO2 layers of 50 nm in thickness. A flow of a pulsed\nelectric current in each Cu wire can generate local magnetic fields, HL, HM\nor HR, which acts on the left end, the main part with notches, or the right\nend of the magnetic wire, respectively. HL (HR) can trigger the nucleation\nof a DW at the left (right) end of the magnetic wire. Thus, the propagation\ndirection of a DW can be controlled by HL (HR). The resistance was\nmeasured by using a four-point dc technique, and an external magnetic\nfield (Hext) was applied along the wire axis. All magnetoresistance (MR)\nmeasurements were performed at room temperature.\nFigure 2(a) shows a typical resistance change of the trilayerd\nmagnetic wire with asymmetric notches as a function of Hext. Before the\nmeasurement, Hext of -200 Oe was applied in order to align the\nmagnetizations of two NiFe layers of the trilayered wire in the same\ndirection. Then, MR measurement was performed while Hext was swept up\nto +200 Oe. When Hext was negative, the resistance showed the smallest\nvalue due to the parallel magnetization alignment of two NiFe layers. Then\nthe resistance suddenly increased and showed the largest value with Hext\nbetween 10 and 162 Oe. We have an evidence from a previous study on\nNiFe wires of various thickness that a thicker NiFe layer has a larger\ncoercive force than thinner one.6 Therefore, this resistance increase\ncorresponds to the magnetization reversal of the NiFe(5 nm) layer, and an\nantiparallel magnetization alignment was realized while the resistance\nshowed the largest value. At 162 Oe, the resistance abruptly decreased from\n\n4\n\n\fthe largest value to the smallest value, which corresponds to the overall\nmagnetization reversal of the NiFe(20 nm) layer. Thus, the magnetic DW\nwas not pinned by asymmetric notches during the magnetization reversals\nof NiFe(20 nm) layer because of its large nucleation field.\nIn order to nucleate of a DW in the NiFe(20 nm) layer at smaller\nHext and to pin the DW at the notch, we utilized the method generating a\npulsed local magnetic field at an end of the magnetic wire.5 Figure 2(b)\nshows the result of the DW injection into the NiFe(20 nm) layer of the\nmagnetic wire by HL. The measurement procedure is the same as that of the\nmeasurement shown in Fig. 2(a), except applying HL when Hext = 60 Oe.\nThe magnitude and the duration of the pulsed HL were 200 Oe and 100 ns,\nrespectively. The resistance abruptly decreased after the application of HL\nand stayed at a value between the largest and the smallest values. The value\nof the resistance indicates that a DW injected from the left by HL was\npinned at the first notch. By increasing Hext after the injection of the DW,\nthe resistance abruptly decreased to the smallest value at 98 Oe, which\nindicates that the DW propagated to the right end of the wire through the\nasymmetric notches. Thus, the depinning field for the rightward\npropagation of the DW can be determined to be 98 Oe. On the other hand,\nthe depinning field for the leftward propagation of the DW can be\ndetermined from the result shown in Fig. 2(c), which shows the MR\nmeasurement when the DW was injected from the right end of the wire by\nHR. In this case, the depinning field was 54 Oe. Thus, the depinning field\nfor the rightward propagation is much larger than that for the rightward\n\n5\n\n\fpropagation. This result indicates that the asymmetric notch in the magnetic\nwire works as an asymmetric pinning potential against the DW\npropagation.\nAs seen in Figs. 2(b) and 2(c), when Hext exceeds the pinning field\nof the first notch, the DW propagates to the end of the wire and cannot be\npinned at the successive notches. This indicates that all notches are\nidentical from the viewpoint of the pinning potential. Here, we demonstrate\nthat a combination of Hext and pulsed HM can move the DW from one notch\nto the neighboring one. This is shown in Fig. 3. The horizontal and the\nvertical axes show the elapsed time from the measurement start and the\nresistance of the sample, respectively. In the beginning of the measurement,\nHext of -200 Oe was applied, and then Hext was swept up to 30 Oe and kept\nat 30 Oe until the measurement finished. When Hext reached 30 Oe, the\nresistance showed the largest value and the magnetizations of two NiFe\nlayers became antiparallel. By the application of the pulsed HR, a DW was\ninjected into the NiFe(20 nm) layer and it was pinned at the first notch,\nwhich results in the first abrupt decrease in resistance. Then, a pulsed HM\nwas applied to the same direction as Hext. The magnitude and the duration\nof the pulsed HM were 20 Oe and 50 ns, respectively. Each HM triggered an\nabrupt decrease in resistance. The value of each resistance change\ncorresponded to the length between the notches. Thus, the DW moved\nnotch by notch by the pulsed HM. We also confirmed that the DW moved\nnotch by notch to the rightward direction by the pulsed HM with the\nopposite polarity.\n\n6\n\n\fThe interpretation why the depinning field depends on the\npropagation direction is the following. Since the DW energy is proportional\nto its area, the DW at wider position in the wire has larger energy. This\nchange in the DW energy along the wire axis produces the pinning\npotential for the DW. The force to move the DW against the potential is\ngiven by the derivative of the DW energy with respect to the DW position,\nwhich is proportional to the slope of the notch. In our magnetic wire shown\nin Fig. 1, the slope of the notch is steeper for the rightward propagation,\nresulting in the larger depinning field for the rightward propagation.\nIn conclusion, pinning and depinning of a magnetic DW in a\nsubmicron magnetic wire with asymmetric notches were investigated by\nutilizing the GMR effect. The DW was nucleated and injected from an end\nof the magnetic wire by a pulsed local magnetic field. The depinning field\nof the DW from the notch depends on the propagation direction of the DW.\nThis indicates that the asymmetric structures constructed into the magnetic\nwire work as asymmetric pinning potential against the DW propagation.\n\nThe present work was partly supported by the Ministry of\nEducation, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (MEXT)\nthrough the Grants-in-Aid for COE Research (10CE2004, 12CE2005) and\nMEXT Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science and Technology\n(Nanospintronics Design and Realization, NDR) and by the 21st Century\nCOE Program by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.\n\n7\n\n\fReferences\n1.
