INTRODUCTION\n\nMany computationally elaborate calculations of\njet-heated cooling flows have been proposed to explain why the hot gas in galaxy clusters cools much\nslower than the rate expected from the cluster Xray luminosity, \u1e40cf \u2248 (2\u03bcmp /5kTvir )Lx (e.g. Cavaliere et al. 2001; Reynolds, Heinz, & Begelman\n2001,2002; Bruggen & Kaiser 2002; McCarthy et\nal. 2003; Hoeft et al. 2003; Basson & Alexander 2003; Omma et al. 2004; dalla Vecchia et al.\n2004; Zanni et al. 2005). In principle the energy\ncreated by gas accreting at rates very much less\nthan \u1e40cf onto supermassive black holes in clustercentered galaxies can easily balance the radiative\nlosses Lx . Consequently, AGN jets have been regarded as a plausible means to distribute this energy throughout the cluster gas. Unfortunately, few\nif any jet-heated flow simulations closely resemble\nin projection the X-ray emission and radial temperature profiles observed in galaxy groups and clusters. Surprisingly often these calculations do not\ninclude radiative losses and therefore lack the essential physics to prove that cooling can be stopped\nby the jets. Nor do these calculations typically continue for many Gyrs. Multi-Gyr calculations are essential to determine if the proposed type of heating\ncan keep the group/cluster gas from cooling while\nalso preserving time-averaged temperature and en1 University of California Observatories/Lick Observatory,\nDepartment of Astronomy and Astrophysics, University of\nCalifornia, Santa Cruz, CA 95064\n2 Dipartimento di Astronomia, Universit\u00e0 di Bologna, via\nRanzani 1, Bologna 40127, Italy\n\ntropy profiles commonly observed, most of which are\nvery similar. In general, the long term effectiveness\nof powerful jet heating in stopping the cooling has\nnot been convincingly demonstrated. As a first step\ntoward a more successful solution, adopted here, jetheating scenarios are sought that are consistent with\nthe global observations of the hot cluster gas. Once\nthis problem is solved, the next step is to determine\nif real black holes can indeed supply energy in the\nform and amount required.\nWe consider here jet-dominated flows in which gas\nnear the cores of cluster-centered elliptical galaxies is accelerated in bipolar outflows when triggered\nby a supermassive black hole feedback mechanism.\nBoth mass and energy are transported out from the\ncenter. The feedback appears largely as an outward flow of mass rather than energy, although the\nenergetics of successful flows must be understood\na postiori. We find that these more massive jets\nhave many desirable long term attributes. We have\ndiscussed elsewhere how heated, buoyant gas can\nrise upstream in cooling flows, transporting mass\nand energy to distant cluster gas in a manner that\nsharply reduces the overall cooling rate and preserves the thermal profiles observed (Mathews, et\nal. 2003; Mathews, Brighenti & Boute 2004). We\nnow turn our attention to the possibility that massloaded subrelativistic jets can accomplish the same\ndesirable results.\nAnother inspiration for the calculations described\nhere are recent HI (Morganti et al. 2004; 2005), UV\n(e.g. Crenshaw et al. 1999; Kriss 2003) and X-ray\n(George et al. 1998; Risaliti et al. 2005) observa-\n\n\f2\ntions of AGNs showing blue-shifted absorption or\nemission lines along the line of sight. Neither the\noptical depth nor the covering factor of the outflowing gas can be accurately determined from these\nobservations, but the outflowing mass flux can be\ncomparable to the Eddington limit, implying that\nrelatively little gas is being directly accreted by the\ncentral black hole. The outflow velocity is typically\nseveral 100 km s\u22121 but increases to several 1000 km\ns\u22121 in a few more luminous objects (Kriss 2004). At\nleast half of all AGNs exhibit outflows so it is plausible that they exist in all objects and with substantial\ncovering factors. Winds from accretion disks are one\npossible explanation for the outflows (Narayan & Yi\n1994; Konigl & Kartje 1994; Blandford & Begelman\n1999; Proga 2000; Soker & Pizzolato 2005), particularly those with higher velocities.\nThe highly uncertain outflowing mass flux observed in low luminosity galaxies (\u1e40 \u223c 1 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ),\nis far less than the mass flux that arrives at the\ncentral galaxies in group and cluster cooling flows,\n\u1e40 \u223c 10 \u2212 300 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . However, outflowing\ngas in these more massive flows is likely to be too\nhot, too rarefied and too highly ionized to produce\nblueshifted UV or X-ray lines and would be difficult to observe. Indeed, currently available UV and\nX-ray absorption observations may naturally select\nthe densest, coldest and most slowly moving gas in\neach outflow. Many authors (e.g. Churazov et al.\n2002; 2005; Peterson & Fabian 2005) argue that the\nmechanical outflow luminosity Lmech from massive\nblack holes can greatly exceed their bolometric luminosity, and this may apply to all radiatively inefficient black holes (Hopkins et al. 2005).\nAs in the Blandford-Begelman accretion model,\nwe assume that the majority of gas accreted at the\nouter edges of the accretion disks ultimately flows\naway from the disk surface as a fast but nonrelativistic wind. Such disk flows are unlike the relativistic e\u00b1 radio-emitting jets driven from much smaller\nregions near the central hole (Blandford & Znajek\n1977), but the two types of outflow may coexist. In\ncontrast, winds driven by radiation pressure from\nthin disks, such as those described by Proga (2000)\nare confined by strong radial, polodial fields (e.g.\nBlandford & Payne 1982), and may be directed\nmostly along the equatorial plane. However, more\naxis-oriented outflows may be possible from thicker\ndisks or with different, more vertical field geometries (e.g. Everett, K\u00f6nigl & Kartje 2001). Nevertheless, fast wind-driven bipolar flows, such as we\nconsider, may at their origin fill cones of significant\nsolid angles. For example, Proga (2003) finds that\nmost of the mass flux in disk winds at high velocities\nv>\n\u223c 1000 km/s, which we require in our flows, lies\nwithin 20 or 30 degrees from the polar axes. Such\nbroad outflows are expected to entrain additional\nambient gas as they proceed out from the central\nregion. Therefore, for our exploratory calculations\nwe adopt a bipolar wind geometry similar to the\n\nprevailing geometry in models of jet-heated cooling\nflows cited above, but allow the jets to have larger\nangular sizes at their source. Most of the mass outflow in our jets arises not from the origin but by\nentrainment of ambient gas at larger radii \u2013 such\na model is supported by the recent observations of\nSun, Jerius & Jones (2005) discussed below. Omma\net al. (2004) considered the initial transient flow resulting from a bipolar outflow of this sort, but did\nnot address the important question whether or not\nsuch jets can shut down the cooling flow for many\nGyrs while preserving the observed thermal gradient in the hot gas. This is our objective here.\nIn the 2D gasdynamical models described here\nnonrelativistic outflows are generated by assigning\na fixed velocity to gas that flows into a biconical\nsource region (radius of a few kpc with half angle\n\u03b8j \u223c 5 \u2212 20\u25e6) at the cluster center. The acceleration\nof gas in the source bicone is activated by a feedback recipe triggered as gas flows into the innermost\nzones. The 2D biconical outflows, which may for example represent a disk wind, proceed along the axis\nof symmetry of the computational grid. Even when\nthe initial outflow has rather substantial opening\nangles (i.e. \u03b8j \u223c 20\u25e6 ), the flow rapidly concentrates\nwithin \u223c 30 kpc into a much narrower jet. This\ncompression occurs because the rapid pressure drop\nin the jet due to expansion causes the jet to be compressed and narrowed by the ambient gas pressure\nwhich decreases less rapidly with radius in the cluster gas. As the jet proceeds, it entrains additional\nambient gas and its mass flux increases. These solutions have two excellent attributes: after many Gyrs\nthe time-averaged gas temperature profile resembles\nthose observed, dT /dr > 0 in r <\n\u223c 0.1rvir , and very\nlittle gas cools below \u223c Tvir . The jet itself is difficult to observe. Finally, because of the intermittent\nnature of the feedback jet excitation, multiple generations of large X-ray cavities are created with 2 or\n4 visible at any time, very similar to Perseus (e.g.\nFabian et al. 2005).\n2. THE CLUSTER A1795\n\nWe compare our gasdynamical calculations with\nthe temperature and density profiles of the wellobserved cluster Abell 1795 (Tamura et al. 201;\nEttori et al. 2002) assumed to be at a distance 243\nMpc. Abell 1795 is a typical rich cluster with a\ncentral cD galaxy and a reasonably relaxed overall\nstructure (Boute & Tsai 1996). Abell 1795 has the\nusual attributes of normal cooling flows: strong central peak in X-ray surface brightness (e.g. Tamura\net al. 2001), a positive temperature gradient dT /dr\nin the central regions out to \u223c 500 kpc, a central\nradiative cooling time \u223c 3 \u00d7 108 yrs that is much\nless than the cluster age (e.g. Edge et al. 1992;\nFabian et al. 2001), optical line emission near the\ncentral cD (Cowie et al. 1983), an excess of blue and\nultraviolet light possibly from massive young stars\n(Johnstone, Fabian & Nulsen 1987; Cardiel, Gor-\n\n\f3\ngas & Aragon-Salamanca 1998; Mittaz et a. 2001)\nand a central radio source 4C 26.42 (McNamara et\nal. 1996a,b). Chandra images near the center of\nAbell 1795 reveal an X-ray emission feature aligned\nwith a remarkable optical filament (Fabian et al.\n2001). This filament and the central total mass profile, M \u221d r0.6 inside 40 kpc, which is somewhat flatter than NFW (Navarro, Frenk & White 1996), may\nsuggest a local deviation from hydrostatic equilibrium.\nWe approximate the total mass profile in A1795\nwith an NFW profile with virial mass Mvir =\n1015 M\u2299 and concentration c = 6.57, which also\nmatches the total mass found from X-ray observations, assuming hydrostatic equilibrium. The de\nVaucouleurs mass profile of the central cD galaxy,\ndefined by M\u2217 \u223c 6 \u00d7 1011 and Re = 8.5 kpc, has\nalso been included, but this mass has little effect on\nthe overall gas dynamics.\n3. COMPUTATIONAL PROCEDURE\n\nThe two-dimensional numerical calculations described here are solutions of the same flow equations described in our earlier paper on heated cooling flows (Brighenti & Mathews 2002). These equations explicitly include radiative cooling. The 2D\ncomputational grid is in spherical polar coordinates\nr and \u03b8. Unless stated otherwise, the grid is comprised of 200 logarithmically spaced radial zones extending to 3 Mpc and having a central zone of size\n0.75 kpc. There are 60 evenly spaced angular zones\nin the range 0 < \u03b8 < \u03c0. Some of our flows have been\ncomputed at higher resolution with 600 logarithmically spaced radial zones extending to 3 Mpc, with a\ncentral zone of size 0.6 kpc, and 120 evenly-spaced\nangular zones. We find that all important results\n(temperature and density profiles, cooling rate, etc.)\nare essentially unchanged when the resolution is improved.\nWhen gas in a computational zone begins to cool\nby radiative losses to low temperatures, usually near\nthe center of the flow, the density of cooling gas in\nthe zone increases to maintain pressure equilibrium\nwith gas in neighboring grid zones. This representation of the cooling process, discretized and averaged\non the grid scale, is unphysical since gas cooling in\npressure equilibrium should eventually occupy a volume much smaller than that of the grid zones. In\norder to approximately allow for this subgrid evolution, we remove cold gas as it forms, assuming that\nits volume becomes vanishingly small. Cooling gas\nis removed by adding a mass sink term to the equation of continuity, \u2212q(T )\u03c1/tcool, where tcool is the local radiative cooling time as described by Brighenti\n& Mathews (2002) and q = 2 exp(\u2212T /Tq )2 becomes\n5\nlarge when T <\n\u223c Tq = 5 \u00d7 10 K. This mass sink\nterm is used to remove the unphysical clutter of\nzones containing cold gas without affecting the flow\nof hotter gas, T \u226b Tq , throughout the rest of the\ncluster.\n\nIn some calculations unphysical cooling also occurs (generally at small radii) along the symmetry\naxis, \u03b8 = 0 or \u03c0, where we employ reflection boundary conditions. As gas approaches a reflecting axis,\nit is compressed and cools in a way that would not\noccur in a full 3D calculation where such reflections\ndo not occur. Nevertheless, this spurious, purely\nnumerical cooling near the symmetry axis is necessarily included in the computations described below. Consequently, our estimates of the cooling rate\n\u1e40 may be regarded as conservative upper limits.\nWhen the flow velocity is entirely radial, as in the\n(unheated) cooling flow described in the next section, this type of boundary cooling does not occur.\n4. NORMAL COOLING FLOW IN A1795\n\nWe begin with a simple evolutionary cooling flow\nfor A1795 in which the gas is allowed to evolve from\nan initial hydrostatic model in good agreement with\nthe observed density and temperature profiles. In\nthis traditional spherical cooling flow all the gas\ncools at the center of the flow and there is no dependence on polar angle \u03b8. For standard cosmological\nparameters (\u03a9 = 0.3; \u039b = 0.7; H = 70 km s\u22121\nMpc\u22121 ) large clusters like Abell 1795 formed relatively recently, so we consider the internal flow evolution for only 7 Gyrs. The dotted lines in Figure\n1 show the radial variation of the gas density and\nemission-weighted temperature in the cooling flow\nafter 7 Gyrs. The gas density follows the observations fairly well beyond about 50 kpc but is systematically too large closer to the center. This density\nexcess is typical for pure cooling flows, as discussed\nby Mathews & Brighenti (2003). The depression\nof the observed (azimuthally averaged) density relative to this flow within 50 kpc may be due in part\nto unresolved X-ray cavities.\nThe cooling rate \u1e40 (t) for this cooling flow, shown\nas a dotted line in Figure 2, increases with time,\napproaching \u223c 400 M\u2299 yr\u22121 after 7 Gyrs. This\ncooling rate is comparable to the cooling rate for\nA1795 estimated by Allen et al. (2000) from deprojected ROSAT images, \u1e40 \u223c 500 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . However, XMM RGS spectra show no evidence of gas\nwith temperatures less than \u223c 2 keV (Tamura et\nal. 2001), indicating a much smaller cooling rate,\n\u1e40 < 150 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . This upper limit is consistent\n\u22121\nwith \u1e40 <\n\u223c 100 M\u2299 yr estimated from Chandra\nobservations (Ettori et al. 2002).\n5. JET OUTFLOWS\n\nGas flows including the effects of jet momentum\nare solved in several stages. Each calculation begins\nwith a static cluster atmosphere based on the observed temperature and density profiles in A1795.\nDuring time 0 < t < 1 Gyr the configuration is\nallowed to evolve (without jets) toward a pure cooling flow, and later during 1 < t < 7 Gyrs the jet\nmomentum is activated according to a feedback criterion.\n\n\f4\nWe adopt a simple computational procedure to\ntrigger jet outflow in which all gas in a biconical\njet source region near the center of the flow is set\ninto outward motion at velocity uj as long as some\nfeedback criterion is satisfied. The geometrical parameters that define the jet source region are the\nradius rj and the half opening angle \u03b8j of the jet.\nWe consider three feedback criteria to activate the\njet:\nA: The gas velocity in the jet source region is set to uj only when the gas cooling rate \u1e40 is non-zero inside a radius of\n1 kpc.\nB: The gas velocity in the jet source region is set to uj only when the net mass\nflow across a sphere of radius 1 kpc is\nnegative (mass inflow).\nC: Continuous jet flow uj in the jet\nsource region at all times.\nDuring times when the jet outflow is not active, gas\nflows through the source region in accordance with\nthe usual gasdynamical equations. Each flow calculation is uniquely designated by mN (X, rj , \u03b8j , uj )\nwhere N is a number assigned to each computed\nflow, X = A, B or C is the feedback criterion, rj is\nthe jet radius in kpc at the source, \u03b8j is the source\njet half-angle in degrees and uj is the jet source velocity in units of 103 km s\u22121 . Flows at the higher\nspatial resolution are designated with upper case\nM N (X, rj , \u03b8j , uj ).\n5.1. A Representative Flow with Jet Momentum\n\nAmong the many models with satisfactory\nor excellent results, we select m1(A, 5, 10, 10)\nas representative and discuss it in more detail. The azimuthally averaged gas density and\nemission-weighted temperature profiles for the\nm1(A, 5, 10, 10) flow are shown at three times in\nFigure 1. The global cooling rate \u1e40 (t) for this\nflow, plotted in Figure 2, is small, indeed its timeaveraged value h\u1e40 (t)i \u2248 20 M\u2299 yr\u22121 is well below the constraints imposed by XMM and Chandra observations. Even more remarkable, both the\ndensity and temperature profiles shown in Figure\n1 retain their cooling flow appearance at time 7\nGyrs. Within about 50 kpc n(r) and T (r) for the\nm(A, 5, 10, 10) flow lie between the pure cooling flow\nand the observations.\nFigure 3 shows in more detail the 2D density\nstructure at several times for the high resolution version of this flow, M 1(A, 5, 10, 10). The four panels\nin Figure 3 show illustrate the growth of successive\ngenerations of buoyant X-ray cavities. Cavities are\nassociated with jet intermittancy. The evolution of\nthe buoyant cavities away from the (horizontal) jet\naxis may be an artifact of the 2D reflection boundary conditions along this axis, but it is comparable\n\nto a similar deviation found in the 3D models of\nBruggen et al. (2002). Nevertheless, the creation of\nmultiple pairs of bubble cavities, similar to those in\nPerseus (Fabian et al. 2003), is an encouraging feature of these jet flows. Finally, we stress that these\njets carry mass as well as energy to large distances\nfrom the central AGN and in this respect they differ\nfrom many previous calculations in which the jets\ncarried little or no mass.\n5.2. Additional Jet Momentum Flows\n\nTable 1 summarizes some of the jet-heated flows\nwe have calculated. For consistency, all results in\nTable 1 refer to flows computed at lower resolution,\nbut are not significantly changed when the grid resolution is refined. In addition to listing the parameters that define each flow, Table 1 gives several additional global results after 6 Gyrs of jet feedback:\nthe total energy Ekin supplied by the jet source,\nthe time-averaged mechanical luminosity generated\nin the jet source region Lmech , the total mass that\ncooled Mcool after t = 7 Gyrs and the average cooling rate h\u1e40 i, and the X-ray luminosity Lx at this\nsame time. For many jet parameter combinations,\nthe mean cooling rate h\u1e40 i is less than or comparable to the Chandra value \u1e40 \u2248 100 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . The\nmechanical energy for successful flows ranges from\n\u223c 0.02Lx to \u223c Lx . We stress that the condition\nLmech >\n\u223c Lx that is usually required to keep jetheated flows from cooling does not necessarily apply to our flows in which mass as well as energy is\ntransported outward. Consequently, successful jetadvecting flows are possible even when Lmech \u226a Lx .\nJet mass transfer appears to be an efficient and robust way to recirculate gas and energy outward with\nlittle radiative cooling while retaining the cooling\nflow appearance as observed in the density and temperature profiles.\nRegarding this latter important point, Figure 4\nshows the gas density and temperature at time t = 7\nGyrs for a sample of successful and unsuccessful\nflows listed in Table 1. The cooling rates for these\nflows (sampled each 0.5 Gyr) are shown in Figure\n5. In both Figures 1 and 4, the computed gas density within about 20-30 kpc from the center exceeds\nthat observed in A1795, but this region of A1795\ncontains a cool, transient optical filament about 60\nkpc in diameter and may be experiencing a local\ndeviation from hydrostatic equilibrium. For many\nof the unsuccessful models with h\u1e40 i >\n\u223c 100 M\u2299\nyr\u22121 , most of the cooling occurs during one or two\nepisodes. These flows would be regarded as successful in matching the X-ray data if they were computed for only \u223c 2\u22123 Gyrs when \u1e40 (t) is acceptably\nsmall, but star formation, which is likely to occur\nduring times of enhanced cooling, would be inconsistent with optical colors of cluster-centered galaxies\n(e.g. McNamara 1997). Enhanced blue light from\nyoung stars typically persists for 2 - 3 Gyrs after a\n\n\f5\nstarburst.\nThe mass Mcool in column (9) of Table 1 represents all the cooled gas that has been removed\nfrom the grid by the term \u2212q(T )\u03c1/tcool in the equation of continuity. Almost all of this gas cools in\nthe central regions. However, Mcool is not small\nand is often much larger than the mass of central\nblack holes (or stars) in cluster-centered galaxies.\nHowever, there are reasons to believe that we have\noverestimated the global cooling rate in our models. For example the sink term \u2212q(T )\u03c1/tcool in the\ncontinuity equation not only removes the cooled gas,\nbut may also encourage local pressure gradients that\nstimulate additional cooling. If gas in a particular\ngrid zone begins to cool while gas is being removed\nby the sink term, hot gas from adjacent zones, that\nwould not otherwise cool, may be stimulated to flow\ntoward the cooling zone, possibly raising the local\ncooling rate unrealistically. As discussed above, we\nalso expect the computed cooling rate to be spuriously enhanced by cooling near the symmetry axis\nwhere reflecting boundary conditions must be employed. Evidence for computational overcooling is\nprovided in the final two models listed in Table\n1, m13(B,5,10,10) and m14(B,5,10,5), in which the\nsink term is set to zero, q(T ) = 0. In flows with\nq = 0, Mcool in Table 1 represents the mass of cooled\ngas (T << Tq = 5 \u00d7 105 K) that remains in the\ngrid and goes into approximate free fall if it is not\nat the center. Values of Mcool for these flows are\nvery small, suggesting that nonzero q(T ) does indeed artificially increase the cooling rate. But real\ncooling at some level can and does occur. Significant centrally-located cold gas and star formation\nare observed in many massive clusters (e.g. Edge\n2001). Recent CO observations of A1795 by Salome\n& Combes (2004) have detected \u223c 1011 M\u2299 of cold\ngas which is entirely consistent with our flow calculations based on an approximate model for A1795.\nIn marked contrast to our earlier models in which\nwe explored a wide variety of heated cooling flows\n(Brighenti & Mathews 2002; 2003), very few of the\njet momentum flows described here have temperature and density profiles that strongly deviate from\nthe observations of A1795. The relative success of\neach jet momentum flow, expressed in column (11)\nof Table 1, is based largely on the magnitude of\nthe mean cooling rate h\u1e40 i. The results in Table 1 and Figures 2 and 5 imply limits on the jet\nsource parameters X, rj , \u03b8j , and uj corresponding\n\u22121\nto h\u1e40 i <\nas observed with Chan\u223c 100 M\u2299 yr\ndra. In particular, radiative cooling is effectively\nshut down for source regions with radii rj >\n\u223c 3 kpc,\no\n>\nhalf angles \u03b8j >\n10\nand\njet\nvelocities\nu\nj\n\u223c\n\u223c 5000 km\ns\u22121 .\n5.3. Nature of the Jet Flow\n\nThe simple jets we employ are based on the\nplausible notion that strong non-relativistic winds\nflow from accretion disks around supermassive black\n\nholes and that these winds return most of the mass\ninflow received from centrally cooling gas. We\nimplement this simple idea by insisting that the\noutflow velocity remains constant and rather large\nthroughout the biconical jet source region whenever a feedback criterion is satisfied. Although this\nmodel for the jet source is admittedly ad hoc, as\nthe jets move further out they appear to develop\nmore universal properties. In this section we briefly\nreview the evolution of jets far beyond the source\nregion.\nThe physical nature of our jets is most clearly\ndefined when the jet activity is continuous in\ntime (models C) such the high resolution model\nM 11(C, 5, 20, 10) in which the overall flow approaches a quasi-steady state. The global velocity\nfield and density contours for the M 11(C, 5, 20, 10)\nflow after 7 Gyrs are shown in Figure 6. The magnitude of the radial gas flow at time 7 Gyrs in\nthree angular directions are shown in Figure 7. It is\napparent from this Figure that the cooling inflow,\nwhich fills most of the cluster volume, flows toward\nthe jet, becomes entrained and is carried outward.\nThe continuous jet creates an extended two-sided\nchannel of low density gas. The difficulty of observing such a channel can be seen in the X-ray\nsurface brightness images of the (high resolution)\nM 1(A, 5, 10, 10) and M 11(C, 5, 20, 10) flows shown\nin Figure 8, viewed perpendicular to the jet. From\nthis viewing direction the jet cavitation in the continuous M 11(C, 5, 20, 10) flow produces at most a\n10% reduction in the X-ray surface brightness along\nthe jet axis. The jet cavitation produced by intermittent flows such as M 1(A, 5, 10, 10) is less pronounced and more difficult to detect. Although our\n2D jets are constrained to flow in a axisymmetric\nfashion along the \u03b8 = 0 and \u03c0 axes, in a full 3D\nsimulation the jets may not follow such a perfectly\nlinear pathway through the cluster gas.\nThe symmetric jet cavitations visible in Figure 8\nare remarkably similar to the Chandra observations\nof the double-jetted radio galaxy NGC 1265 by Sun,\nJerius & Jones (2005). The X-ray contours in their\nFigure 1a show symmetric indentations along the\nradio jet axis just as in our Figure 8, suggesting that\nambient hot gas in NGC 1265 is being entrained\nand swept along with the jet. This observation also\nsupports the biconical outflow geometry that we assume here rather than disk winds in the equatorial\nplane (e.g. Proga 2000).\nIt is apparent from Figure 8 that our jets are\npoorly resolved, often occupying only a few angular zones even at the higher grid resolution. This\npoor resolution restricts somewhat our analysis of\nthe transverse jet profiles. Nevertheless, the behavior of the gas outside of the small jet regions \u2013 which\ndetermines the overall X-ray properties of the cluster \u2013 does not appear to be strongly affected by the\nlevel of numerical resolution in the jets.\nTo understand better the details of the jet-\n\n\f6\natmosphere interaction, we have examined the high\nresolution jet in the M 11(C, 5, 20, 10) flow. One\nnatural attribute of the biconical jet source region\nis that the original gas within the source is expelled\nvery rapidly after the jet turns on. Consequently,\nduring most of the active phase of this region, most\nof the outgoing gas is supplied by recent advection\nnear the outer boundary of the bicone. As a result, most of the mass outflowing from the jet at rj\noccurs near \u03b8j so the initial jet density profile perpendicular to the jet axis is hollow with a strong\ncentral minimum. This type of hollow jet structure\nmay in fact be physically appropriate if entrainment\nof ambient gas occurs near the source region.\nAn important feature of these jet solutions is\nthe narrowing of the jets as they moves outward.\nAlthough the half angle of biconical jets \u03b8j can\nbe rather large, these initially conical jets become\nnearly cylindrical as they move outward. This jet\nfocusing occurs because the pressure in the jet is\nrapidly lowered by expansion and tends to decrease\nwith radius faster than the pressure in the ambient gas. As a result the jets are compressed and\ncollimated by the ambient gas pressure.\nA number of (poorly resolved) internal shocks appear in the jet flow that we do not describe in detail\nhere. The main effect of these shocks, even inside\nthe jet source region, is to raise the temperature\nand entropy within the central jet to rather high\nvalues. Gas in the jet source and just beyond flows\napproximately at the sound speed within the jet.\nAs the jet moves further out, the mass outflow in\nthe jet increases due to entrainment. The amount\nof entrainment is approximately independent of the\nspatial resolution. The top panel in Figure 9 shows\nthe variation of the (outward) mass flux transverse\nto the jet axis in the continuous M 11(C, 5, 20, 10)\njet at various cluster radii. The quantity plotted is\nd\u1e40 /d\u03b8 = \u03c1vr 2\u03c0r2 sin(\u03b8) M\u2299 yr\u22121 where vr (\u03b8) is\nthe local jet velocity. It is clear from Figure 9 the\nangular width of the jet narrows from its initial half\nangle \u03b8j = 20\u25e6 as it moves out and remains hollow\nto rather large distances in the cluster.\nOf particular interest is the radial increase of\nthe integrated mass flow in the jet, \u1e40 (\u03b8) =\nR\u03b8\n0 (d\u1e40 /d\u03b8)d\u03b8, plotted in the lower panel of Figure\n9. The total mass outflow in the jet and its approximate local angular width \u03b8max (r), can be estimated from the maximum \u1e40 = \u1e40 (\u03b8max ) in each\ncurve. The decline in \u1e40 (\u03b8) for \u03b8 > \u03b8max is due to\nthe negative contribution to the integrated flow beyond \u03b8max caused by slowly inflowing gas adjacent\nto the jet. The mass flux increases from 65 M\u2299 /yr\nat 5 kpc to 116 M\u2299 /yr at 20 kpc and reaches 170\nM\u2299 /yr at 200 kpc. This increase shows that mass\nentrainment is a key feature of the success of these\nsimulations. For model M 11(C, 5, 20, 10) in which\nthe jet is continuously active, \u1e40 (\u03b8 = 90\u25e6 ) becomes\nessentially zero, indicating that the jet is returning\n\nmass to large radii at the same rate that it arrives at\nthe center in the cooling inflow outside the jet. This\nmass conservation is approximately true for all the\nother flows, for example \u1e40 (90\u25e6 ) \u2248 \u221212 \u00b1 4 M\u2299 /yr\nfor the flows plotted in Figure 4.\nWe find that the decelerating jets penetrate to\nlarge distances in the cluster gas, well beyond several hundred kpc. However, the maximum distance\nto which the jet outflow continues is observed to\nincrease with the refinement of the computational\ngrid and this must be explored in future calculations. In fully 3D versions of the M 11(C, 5, 20, 10)\njet we expect that the lateral motions of jet due to\nshear instabilities may cause the jet to dissipate its\nenergy at a somewhat smaller radius.\n6. CONCLUSIONS\n\nSubrelativistic jet flows that entrain ambient gas\nmay be the essential key for solving the cluster cooling flow problem: Why the hot gas temperature and\ndensity profiles resemble cooling flows but show no\nspectral evidence for cooling below \u223c Tvir /3 at rates\nexpected from the luminosity Lx . Many scenarios\nhave been previously considered in which the gas is\nheated by a variety of mechanisms including jets. In\nmost previous jet calculations it has been assumed\nthat the jets are primarily sources of energy that\nreheat the cluster gas with no significant outward\nmass transport. Overall, these simulations have not\nbeen successful in reducing the cooling rate while\nmaintaining the observed temperature and density\nprofiles for many Gyrs. Because of the large number of cooling core clusters observed, cooling must\nbe sharply reduced or arrested for many Gyrs.\nThe mass-carrying jets considered here are a variant of the circulation flows we have discussed in\nwhich buoyant bubbles provide an outward mass\ntransport while most of the X-ray emission comes\nfrom a normal cooling interbubble inflow (Mathews,\net al. 2003; Mathews, Brighenti & Boute 2004).\nOur computational results for mass-carrying jets\nare robust in that we find satisfactory multi-Gyr\nsolutions for a significant range of parameters describing the initial central jet outflow. The important global features of our flows are also insensitive to computational resolution. The jet outflow\nis stimulated by cooling or inflowing gas near the\ncentral supermassive black hole, but the success of\nour longterm solutions is not strongly dependent on\nthe specifics of this feedback mechanism. The natural intermittancy of the feedback generates multiple generations of X-ray cavities similar to those\nobserved in the Perseus Cluster and elsewhere. Nevertheless, the physics at the source of outflow is\npoorly understood and observational support is limited. More detailed models of mass-carrying jets will\nbe necessary before they can be fully accepted.\nOne possible objection to the jet driven mass circulation described here is that SNIa-enriched gas\nthat enters the source cone (within the central E\n\n\f7\ngalaxy) is transported out only along the jet axis,\nunlike the observed iron abundance pattern which\nis spherically symmetric around the central galaxy\n(de Grandi et al. 2004). Either the radio jet precesses (Gower, et al. 1982) as in the cluster observed\nby Gitti et al. (2005) or the jet axis direction was\naltered by black hole mergers at early times when\n\nmost of the SNIa iron was produced.\nStudies of the evolution of hot gas in elliptical\ngalaxies at UC Santa Cruz are supported by NASA\ngrants NAG 5-8409 & ATP02-0122-0079 and NSF\ngrant AST-0098351 for which we are very grateful.\n\nREFERENCES\nAllen, S.
