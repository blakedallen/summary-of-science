Transport measurements in applied magnetic field further indicate that spin-wave scattering\nis a key transport mechanism at low temperatures.\nPACS numbers: 75.30.-m, 72.10.-d\n\nThe observation of colossal magnetoresistance CMR effect in manganite films [1] has produced a resurgence of\ninterest in these materials for both fundamental physics\nand their possible application in recording media and\nmagnetic switching devices. The microscopic transport\nmechanism in these materials has long been thought to\nbe double exchange DE [2, 3, 4]. However, it has been\nrealized [5] that the effective carrier-spin interaction in\nthe DE model is too weak to lead to a significant reduction of the electronic bandwidth, which would justify the\nobserved several orders of magnitude increase in conductivity just below the Curie temperature TC . Indeed, a\nlarge number of experiments have shown that the DE\nscenario alone cannot account for the properties of the\nmanganites and that CMR is not purely electronic in\norigin [6, 7].\nLow-temperature charge transport measurements of\nmanganites in the ferromagnetic metallic state are essential in clarifying the specific mechanisms responsible\nfor the CMR effect. At low temperatures, a dominant T 2\nterm in resistivity has generally been observed [8, 9, 10].\nAlthough the T 2 behavior is consistent with electronelectron interaction [11], the coefficient of the T 2 term\nis about 60 to 70 times larger than the one expected\nfor electron-electron scattering [12]. Moreover, a careful check of the low-temperature resistivity [13, 14] has\nshown substantial deviation from the T 2 \u2212like behavior in\nthe very low temperature region. Other power-law temperature dependences of the resistivity have also been\nreported [10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. At present, there is\nno agreement on the actual scattering mechanism below\nthe Curie temperature.\nHere, we address the low-temperature scattering mechanism in manganites through resistivity measurements\nof La0.8\u2212y Sr0.2 MnO3 (y = 0 and 0.128) films grown on\nSrTiO3 substrates, measured in zero field as well as applied magnetic fields up to 14 T. Our data indicate that\nspin-wave scattering, which gives a T 7/2 dependence in\nthe low-temperature resistivity, is a dominant dissipation\n\nmechanism in the ferromagnetic state of these manganites, besides scattering of small polarons by a soft optical\nphonon mode. Our analysis of the resistivity data in\nterms of small-polaron and spin-wave scattering mechanisms, and the spin fluctuation model also gives the observed difference in the metal-insulator transition temperature TMI of the three films studied.\nThin films of La0.8 Sr0.2 MnO3 and La0.672 Sr0.2 MnO3\nwere grown on (100) SrTiO3 single crystal substrates by\nusing pulsed laser deposition technique. The substrate\ntemperature was 7500C, and the oxygen partial pressure\nin the chamber was maintained at 0.2 mbar. The growth\nprocedure and its optimization is described elsewhere\n[20, 21]. The film thickness was deduced from deposition\ntime normalized to calibration runs. The DC resistivity of the films was measured in zero-field as well as in\napplied magnetic fields up to 14 T using the standard\nfour-probe technique. The electrical current was in the\nfilm plane, perpendicular to the applied magnetic field.\nA constant current of 100 \u03bcA provided by a Keithley\n2400 sourcemeter was used. The magnetization M was\nmeasured in a magnetic field parallel to the film plane\nusing a Quantum Design Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) magnetometer.\nFigure 1 shows zero-field resistivity data for the 200\n\u00c5 lanthanum deficient La0.672 Sr0.2 MnO3 film, and for\nthe 200 and 2000 \u00c5 La0.8 Sr0.2 MnO3 films. The 200 \u00c5\nlanthanum deficient film has a TMI of 364 K, which is\nclose to that of a La0.7 Sr0.3 MnO3 single crystal [8]. The\nobserved TMI of 280 K for the 200 \u00c5 La0.8 Sr0.2 MnO3\nis close to the values of 270 and 290 K, obtained for\nas-grown and annealed in N2 gas films, respectively,\nwith same composition [22]. The TMI of 188 K for the\n2000 \u00c5 La0.8 Sr0.2 MnO3 film is lower than that for single crystal specimens [8]. One possible explanation is\nthe nonstoichiometric oxygen content in this film. In\nfact, a significant effect of the oxygen content on TMI\nhas been observed in La1\u2212x Srx MnO3 single crystals [23].\nThus, the composition of this low-TMI film is probably\n\n\f2\n1 00\n\n12\n2000 \u00c5 La0.8Sr0.2MnO3\n\n\u03c1 (\u00d71 0- 4 \u03a9 cm)\n\n\u03c1 (\u03a9 cm)\n\n10\n\n1 0- 2\n200 \u00c5 La0.8Sr0.2MnO3\n\n1 0- 3\n\n200 \u00c5 La0.672S r0.2M n O3\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n8\n6\n\n(a)\n\n4\n\n200 \u00c5 La0.672Sr0.2MnO3\n\n2\n-4\n\n16\n\n10\n\n100\n\n200\nT (K)\n\n300\n\n400\n\nFIG. 1: Zero-field resistivity \u03c1 as a function of temperature\nT of the 200 \u00c5 La0.672 Sr0.2 MnO3 film, and the 200 and 2000\n\u00c5 La0.8 Sr0.2 MnO3 films, grown on (100) SrTiO3 substrates.\n\n14\n\u03c1 (\u00d71 0- 4 \u03a9 cm)\n\n0\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200 \u00c5 La0.8S r0.2M n O3\n\n12\n10\n8\n\n(b)\n\n6\n\nA\u03c9s\n+ BT 7/2 ,\n\u03c1(T ) = \u03c10 +\n2\nsinh (h\u0304\u03c9s /2kB T )\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c10 , the residual resistivity due to various\ntemperature-independent scattering mechanisms, is\ntaken as the resistivity at 10 K, and A, \u03c9s (average\nfrequency of the softest optical mode), and B are fitting coefficients. The excellent fit of the data with\nEq. (1) (solid curves in Fig. 2) suggests that the\nterms A\u03c9s / sinh2 (h\u0304\u03c9s /2kB T ) and BT 7/2 capture the basic physics responsible for charge carrier scattering in this\nlow-temperature region. The values of TMI , \u03c10 , and the\nfitting coefficients of these films are given in Table I.\nPrevious reports have shown that the resistivity of\nLa0.75 Sr0.25 MnO3 films grown on (100) LaAlO3 substrate\nfollows well a \u03c1(T ) dependence similar to Eq. (1) in which\nthe third term, however, has a T 9/2 power-law dependence, indicative of two-magnon scattering [17]. Nevertheless, the fit of our resistivity data with Eq. (1) for\nthe three films studied is better over a wider temperature range than a fit in which the third term in \u03c1(T ) is\nBT 9/2 .\nAccording to the theory of small-polaron conduction\nat low temperatures [24], the relaxation rate 1/\u03c4 for\nsmall polarons is proportional to 1/ sinh2 (h\u0304\u03c9s /2kB T )\n\n4\n0\n\n30\n\n60\n\n90\n\n120\n\n150\n\n30\n\u03c1 (\u00d71 0- 3 \u03a9 cm)\n\nLa0.8 Sr0.2 MnO3\u2212\u03b4 . The TC of each film, determined from\nmagnetization measurements (data not shown), coincides\nwith its TMI . The residual resistivity of these films increases with decreasing TMI , indicating that the films\nwith lower TMI are worse metals at low temperatures.\nTo elucidate the scattering mechanisms in the ferromagnetic metallic region, we plot in Fig. 2 the lowtemperature behavior of the zero-field resistivity for the\nfilms studied. The resistivities of the three films can be\nfitted well with\n\n200\n\n2000 \u00c5 La0.8S r0.2M n O3\n\n25\n20\n15\n\n(c)\n\n10\n5\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nT (K)\nFIG. 2:\nLow-temperature resistivity \u03c1(T ), measured in\nzero field, for (a) 200 \u00c5 La0.672 Sr0.2 MnO3 film, (b) 200 \u00c5\nLa0.8 Sr0.2 MnO3 film, and (c) 2000 \u00c5 La0.8 Sr0.2 MnO3 film,\ngrown on (100) SrTiO3 substrates. The solid lines are fits of\nthe data with Eq. (1).\n\n[13, 17]. Thus, the term A\u03c9s / sinh2 (h\u0304\u03c9s /2kB T ) in Eq.\n(1) is consistent with small polaron coherent motion involving relaxation due to a soft optical phonon mode\n[13]. The values of the fitting parameter h\u0304\u03c9s /2kB of\nthe La0.8\u2212y Sr0.2 MnO3 films are in the 15.1 to 71.9 K\nrange, in agreement with values determined from lowtemperature specific heat (h\u0304\u03c9s /2kB = 48 K) and other\nresistivity studies of La1\u2212x Cax MnO3 [13, 17]. In addition, inelastic neutron scattering [25] and reflectivity [26]\nmeasurements support the phononic character of charge\ncarriers for La0.8 Sr0.2 MnO3 .\nWe attribute the T 7/2 dependence of the lowtemperature resistivity in Eq.

The reason is the following. In the general theory of\nspin-wave interactions proposed by Dyson in early 1956,\nwhich gives a complete description of the thermodynamic\nproperties of a ferromagnet at low temperatures, the\nmean-free path l for spin-spin collisions is proportional\nto T \u22127/2 [27]. This gives a T 7/2 temperature dependence for the resistivity since \u03c1 = m\u2217 vF /(ne2 l), where\nm\u2217 is the effective mass of the charge carriers, n is the\ncarrier concentration, and vF is the Fermi velocity. In\nfact, when the spin orientation angle between neighboring sites is small enough, the DE Hamiltonian in the lowtemperature ferromagnetic state can be mapped into the\nHeisenberg Hamiltonian.\nThe temperature independent term \u03c10 in Eq. (1) is\nusually ascribed to scattering from impurities, defects,\ngrain boundaries, and domain walls. The values of \u03c10 for\nthe 200 \u00c5 La0.8\u2212y Sr0.2 MnO3 films are comparable with\nthe value for a La0.8 Sr0.2 MnO3 single crystal [8], indicating weak external scattering. In general, \u03c10 is proportional to m\u2217 /n\u03c40 , where \u03c40 is the zero-temperature\nrelaxation time. Assuming that \u03c40 does not change a\nlot among the present films, the smaller (larger) value\nof \u03c10 for the 200 \u00c5 La0.672 Sr0.2 MnO3 film (2000 \u00c5\n\n16\n\u03c1 (\u00d71 0- 3 \u03a9 cm)\n\n25\n\n\u03c1 (\u00d71 0- 4 \u03a9 cm)\n\n14\n12\n10\n\n20\n15\n10\n\nH=0 T\nH=3 T\nH=7 T\nH=10 T\nH=14 T\n\n5\n0\n\n0\n\n100 200 300 400\nT (K)\n\n8\n\nH=0 T\nH=3 T\nH=7 T\nH=10 T\nH=14 T\n\n6\n4\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n8 0 100 120 140 160\nT (K)\n\nFIG. 3: Low-temperature resistivity \u03c1(T ) of the 200 \u00c5\nLa0.8 Sr0.2 MnO3 film grown on a (100) SrTiO3 substrate, measured in various applied magnetic fields H.

As discussed above,\nn < 0.2 is probably a result of oxygen vacancies. These\nresults for n are consistent with the defect chemistry [28]\nand are included in Table I.\nNext we show that the observed difference in TMI or\nTC for the three films studied can be explained based\non the values of the above fitting parameters. The spin\nfluctuation model [29] gives TC \u2243 W n(1 \u2212 n)/20, where\nW is the electronic \"bare\" bandwidth. However, it has\nbeen shown that the huge isotope effect [6], the strong\nsensitivity to oxygen content [30], and the significant\nstrain effect [21] present in these manganites can be well\nexplained if W is replaced by an effective bandwidth\nWef f \u221d W exp(\u2212\u03b3Eb /h\u0304\u03c9), where Eb is the binding energy of the polarons, which can be estimated from the\nactivation energy EA as Eb \u2243 2EA , \u03c9 is the characteristic frequency of the optical phonon mode, which can\nbe taken as \u03c9 \u2243 \u03c9s , and \u03b3 is a positive constant. The\nexpression of TC , in which W is replaced by Wef f , shows\nthat TC increases as W , \u03c9, and n increase (for n \u2264 0.5)\nand EA decreases. Spin-wave scattering implies that the\n\u22127/2\n[14], where Ds \u221d W is\nfitting coefficient B \u221d Ds\nthe spin-wave stiffness coefficient [3, 4]. Hence, an increase in W is reflected as a decrease in B. We determined EA to be 1068 and 1546 K for the 200 and 2000\n\u00c5 La0.8 Sr0.2 MnO3 film, respectively, by fitting the resistivity data in the high-temperature paramagnetic region\nin terms of the adiabatic small-polaron model [31]. We\ntook EA for the 200 \u00c5 La0.672 Sr0.2 MnO3 film, for which\nthe available data in the paramagnetic region are over a\nnarrow temperature range due to its higher TMI , to be\nthe same as EA for the 200 \u00c5 La0.8 Sr0.2 MnO3 film [21].\nThese values of EA are also included in Table I. As predicted above, Table I shows that, indeed, the film with\nlarger \u03c9 and n and smaller B and EA has higher TMI .\nTherefore, the present results further provide strong support for the small phonon and magnon scatterings as lowtemperature dissipation mechanisms.\nWe now address the effect of the magnetic field on\nthe low-temperature conduction. Figure 3 is a plot of\n\u03c1 vs T data (T \u2264 120 K) of the 200 \u00c5 La0.8 Sr0.2 MnO3\nfilm measured at various magnetic fields, while its inset shows \u03c1(H, T ) over the whole measured temperature\nrange (2 \u2264 T \u2264 400 K).

(1), with A and B fitting parameters and \u03c9s\ntaken from zero-field fitting, give the solid curves. Notice the excellent agreement between the curves and the\ndata. Equally good fitting results were obtained for the\nother two films studied. This universality of charge dissipation at low temperatures with respect to thickness,\ncomposition, and magnetic field further indicates that\nthe proposed dissipation mechanisms are intrinsic.\nThe above fitting has shown that A is only weak\nfield dependent, while B has a stronger field dependence\n[B(H) is shown in Fig. 4]. Hence, the magnetoresistance observed in this low-temperature range is absorbed\nprimarily in the T 7/2 term. This is a reasonable result\nsince this term is the spin-wave contribution to scattering, hence, resistivity.\nFigure 4 shows the magnetic field dependence of both\nB and TMI of the 200 \u00c5 La0.8 Sr0.2 MnO3 film. The effect\nof an applied field is to open an energy gap in the magnon\nspectrum. As a result, the spin-wave scattering should\ndecrease with increasing H. This is, indeed, reflected by\nthe decrease of B with increasing H. Note also that TMI\nincreases with increasing H. This correlation between\nTMI and B further indicates that spin-wave scattering is\na key transport mechanism at low temperatures in these\nmanganites.\nIn conclusion, we presented resistivity measurements\nin fields up to 14 T on La0.8\u2212y Sr0.2 MnO3 films with different composition and/or thickness. Our results indicate\nthat the dissipation mechanisms in the low-temperature\nferromagnetic state are spin-wave and small-polaron scattering. The fitting parameters obtained by analyzing the\nresistivity data in terms of these dissipation mechanisms\nexplain the observed difference in TMI among the films\nstudied. Transport measurements in applied magnetic\nfields indicate that spin-wave scattering is an essential\n\n[1] S. Jin, T. H. Tiefel, M. McCormack, R. A. Fastnacht, R.\nRamesh, and L. H.
