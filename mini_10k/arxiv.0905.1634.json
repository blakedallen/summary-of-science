It has been used to study the phase separation in a polaron\nliquid by Emin [1,2]. We propose to extend the Van der Walls scheme to describe the complex\nphase separation in cuprates appearing for doping larger than 1/8 where a polaron striped metallic\nphase with doping larger than 1/8 co-exists with a high density phase [3-6]. This phase separation\nhas been shown to be driven by the co-existence of pseudo Jahn-Teller polarons (PJTP), associated\nwith the rombic distortion of the CuO4 square plane and its tilting in the vertical o horizontal\ndirection or antinodal directions.[7-10] These PJTP polarons are in the intermediate coupling range\nbetween large and small polarons, having an area of about 8 Cu sites. [11] These PJTP coexist with\nitinerant particles moving in the nodal direction. [12,13]\nThe PJTP get self organized below a critical temperature T* with the formation of electronic\npolaron striped phases at critical density close to 1/8 holes per Cu site, giving the so called\npseudogap phase. [14-21] The interaction between the PJTP is clearly anisotropic because of the\nassociated rombic distortion therefore they have the tendency to form linear polaron strings. [22,\n23] The polaronic electron-phonon interaction depends in these heterostructrures at the atomic limit\n[24-26] on the lattice misfit strain between the active CuO2 layers and the spacer layers. [27-31] that\nplays a key role also in diborides [32] and iron pnictides [33].\nThe phase diagram of cuprate superconductors shows that a PJTP polarons striped phase called also\na quasi 1D generalized Wigner polaron crystal is formed at critical values of the charge density (1/8\nholes per Cu site and a critical strength of the elastic field due to the misfit strain. The critical\ndensity for the formation of a electronic polaronic crystal depends on the effective volume occupied\nby the polaron carriers. The anisotropic interactions between the polarons produce the stripe phases.\nIn order to give account of the new emerging complex phase diagram, where phase separation is\ncontrolled by doping and misfit strain [27-33], we have extended the model of Poole et al. [34] for\nsupercooled water, as proposed by Campi et al. [35], to describe the 3D phase diagram including all\ndifferent HTcS families.\n\n2.\n\nThe model\n\nWe use a modified Van der Waals interaction model, analogously to the one introduced for the\nphase diagram of supercooled water [34,35]. In fact, supercooled water, a prototype of complex\nmatter, shows a phase separation driven by the tendency of water molecules to form quasi 1D arrays\nof hydrogen bonds. This tendency gives fluctuating clusters made of a low density liquid (LDL) that\ncoexists with the high density liquid water (HDL). In order to describe this anomalous phase\nseparation in water, the model of Poole et al. [35] implements the standard Van der Waals model by\nincluding a characteristic gain in energy \"\u03b3\" for the formation of clusters with directional hydrogen\nbonds at a particular preferential volume \"V\u03b3\". The introduction of this anisotropic interaction\nprovides a phase diagram with the coexistence of a high density liquid (HDL) and a low density\nliquid (LDL) when \u03b3 is larger than a threshold value.\nHere we have extended the Poole model in order to describe the phase separation in the polaron\nliquid in cuprates. The free energy of a complex system in which a phase separation is observed, is\nobtained by adding the term A\u03b3, to the Van der Waals free energy AVDW yielding a total free energy:\nA = AVDW + A\u03b3\n\n(1)\n\n\fwhere AVDW and A\u03b3 are given by:\nAVdW = \u2212RT{ln[(V \u2212 b) / \u039b3 ]+ 1}\u2212 a 2 /V\n\n(2)\n\n\uf8ee\n\uf8eb \u03b3 \uf8f6\uf8f9\nA\u03b3 = \u2212 RTf ln \uf8ef\u03a9 + exp\uf8ec \u2212\n\uf8f7\uf8fa \u2212 RT (1 \u2212 f )(\u03a9 + 1) (3)\n\uf8ed RT \uf8f8\uf8fb\n\uf8f0\nHere a and b are the standard Van der Waals constants. The Van der Waals constant a is associated\nwith the isotropic inter-particle attraction and the constant b is associated to the volume occupied by\nfluid particle. These parameter are used to define the critical values of thermodynamic variables Tc,\nPc and Vc and the standard parameter \u03b30 = a/b for the Van der Waals model. The value of the\nparameter \u03a9 is defined as \u03a9 = exp(-S\u03b3/R), where S\u03b3 is entropy of formation for a mole of\nanisotropic bonds. The intermediate phase is characterized by the anisotropic inter-particle\ninteraction \u03b3. In this approach there are \u03a9>>1 configurations all having \u03b3 = 0 and only a single\nconfiguration in which the formation of the anisotropic bonds with energy \u03b3 is allowed. The\nanisotropic interaction is most likely to occur when the bulk molar volume is consistent with the\npreferential volume V\u03b3. In fact, each particle has an optimal local volume for the formation of\nanisotropic bonds to its neighbors. Changing the particle density, when V \u2260 V\u03b3, the anisotropic\ninteractions are only a fraction f of the total, since V is no longer consistent with the possibility that\nall anisotropic interactions are saturated at the optimal volume. The remaining fraction of bonds, 1f, occurs in an unfavorable local volume and therefore, they cannot form the anisotropic bonds of\nthe phase. The term f is given by:\n\n\uf8ee \uf8eb V \u2212 V\u03b3\nf = \uf8ef\u2212 \uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ef\uf8f0 \uf8ed \u03c3\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n2\n\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\uf8fb\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c3 characterizes the width of the region of volume around V\u03b3 over which a significant fraction\nof anisotropic bonds can be described by Eq. (3).\nTo describe the phase diagram of xuprates where we observe two phase separations, we consider a\nPoole model with one anisotropic interaction \u03b3 giving rise to the intermediate phase with\npreferential volume V\u03b3. that simulate the striped polaron phase in cuprates at doping 1/8.\nThe inclusion in the model of the optimum volume V\u03b3 for the anisotropic bond introduces a new\nminimum in the free energy when V approaches V\u03b3. In Fig. 1 we have plotted the normalized free\nenergy A/\u03b30 as functions of the normalized volume V/Vc at the fixed normalized interaction energy\n\u03b3/\u03b3c = 1. We observe in the phase diagram that the new minimum occurs only for temperature lower\nthan the critical value T/Tc = 0.68.\nWe observe that the effect of the A\u03b3 term in Eq. (1), related with the strength of the anisotropic\ninteractions, is to \"split\" the normal Van der Waals spinodal curve by imposing thermodynamic\nstability in the region of states centered at the reduced density b/V = 0.5 where the intermediate\nphase is stable. As a result, two spinodal lines occur, each terminating at a critical point producing\ntwo phase separation regions. As the directional bond energy \u03b3 decrease respect with the Van der\nWaals interaction \u03b30, the phase separations generated by the strength of the directional bond\ndecrease and the stabilizing effect of A\u03b3 set in only at lower temperature. The critical points merge\nwith the high density spinodal of the main Van der Waals spinodal line that is formed when \u03b3 go to\nzero.\nIn the phase diagrams of panel a), b), c) of Fig. 2 we change the \u03b3 value in order to show the effects\nof the strength of the anisotropic interaction on the thermodynamic behavior of the system.\n\n\fIn panel a), we have used the value \u03b3/\u03b30 = 3.0, in fact for a value of \u03b3/\u03b30 > \u03b3c we observe that appear\na second phase separation that becomes more defined when we continue to increase \u03b3 interaction.\nWhen \u03b3 decreasing to the critical value (\u03b3=\u03b3c) \u03b3/\u03b30 = 1.48, the two spinodal lines, (1+2) and (2+3),\nare going to overlap in a point (panel b), and then, when \u03b3 becomes lower than the threshold \u03b30, a\nphase separation merges with the other in a greater region of phase coexistence and the intermediate\nphase (2) becomes an isolated pocket of stability completely enclosed within a spinodal line as\nshow in the panel c). If we continue to decrease the strength of the anisotropic interaction we obtain\na more isolated pocket with a lower critical temperature until when the anisotropic interaction\n\u03b3/\u03b30 go to zero we reach a quantum critical point where we obtain the standard Van der Waals phase\ndiagram.\n\n3. Interaction energy phase diagram\nHere present the phase diagram at constant low temperature as a function of the directional\ninteraction energy and the reduced density. We have used the previous phase diagrams to get the\nnew one, in fact we calculate the value of each interaction energy normalized \u03b3/\u03b3c at a certain\nreduced density b/V with the temperature fixed at a fixed value.\nAs we have normalized all the thermodynamic variables and energies respect with their critical\nvalues we obtain a universal phase diagram.\nWe obtain that three different phases occur, separated by three regions of phase coexistence. As the\ntemperature increases, the phase separations generated by the strength of the directional bond\ndecrease and the different phases are no longer well separated.\nIn the phase diagram of Fig. 3 we use value T/Tc = 0.4 and we observe the occurrence of three\ndifferent phases, well separated by three regions of phase coexistence.\n\n4.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn conclusion we have presented a model for an electronic complex system that simulate the phase\ndiagram of the polaron liquid in cuprates with coexistence of different electronic phases at critical\ndensities and coexistence of different liquids described by the modified Van der Waals model.\nWe discuss the critical values of the anisotropic interactions for the spinodal lines and we find that\nthis model is able to describe a generic complex system with a variable anisotropic energy\ninteraction.\nFinally we have shown a phase diagram for complex system where critical temperature depends on\nthe density and the energy of the anisotropic interaction.\nThis approach might be useful to study complex phased separations like that in high Tc\nsuperconductors\n\nAknowledgements: This work was supported by European project 517039 \"Controlling\nMesoscopic phase separation\" (COMEPHS) (2005).\n\n\fReferences\n1.\n2.\n3.\n\n4.\n5.\n\n6.\n\n7.\n\n8.\n9.\n\n10.\n\n11.\n\n12.\n13.\n\n14.\n\n15.\n\n16.\n\nD.

The normalized free energy as a function of reduced volume V/Vc at different\ntemperatures. In this way the novel minimum of the free energy occurs at a reduced density\ndifferent respect the minimum of the VdW model. This new minimum, indicates the occurrence of\nthe intermediate phase, become deeper when the temperature decreases, as shown in the plots for\nT/Tc = 0.40, 0.44, 0.48, 0.56, 0.60, 0.68 and 0.76.\nFigure 2. The phase diagrams obtained by computing the spinodal lines from Eq. (1). We can\nobserve the occurrence of two phase separations indicated by the two spinodal lines in panel a). In\nthe panel b) and c) we show the effect of the decreasing strength of the directional bond.\nFigure 3. The normalized energy of the directional interaction \u03b3/\u03b3c as a function of reduced density\nb/V at T/Tc=0.4. We identify three different phases, well separated by three regions of phase\ncoexistence with a critical minimum value of the directional interaction \u03b3/\u03b3c, below this minimum\nvalue the a pure phase (2) assigned to the PJT striped polaron phase, or pseudo gap phase, is not\nobserved.\n\n\fFigure 1.\n\n\fFigure 2\n\n\fFigure 3.\n\n\f"}
