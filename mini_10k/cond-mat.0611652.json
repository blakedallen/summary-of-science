Introduction\nA many-body system rapidly brought out of an initial equilibrium state by quenching it\nto either a critical point or into a coexistence region of the phase-diagramme where\nthere are at least two equivalent equilibrium states undergoes ageing, that is the\nphysical state depends on the time since the quench was performed and hence timetranslation invariance is broken. Furthermore, either the competition between the\ndistinct equilibrium states or else non-equilibrium critical dynamics leads to a slow\ndynamics, where observables depend non-exponentially on time. Both aspects of ageing\ncan be conveniently studied through the two-time response and correlation functions\ndefined as\n\u0012 \u0013\nt\n\u03b4h\u03c6(t, r)i\ny\u2192\u221e\n\u2212a\u22121\n=s\nfR\n, fR (y) \u223c y \u2212\u03bbR /z\n(1.1)\nR(t, s) =\n\u03b4h(s, r) h=0\ns\n\u0012 \u0013\nt\ny\u2192\u221e\n, fC (y) \u223c y \u2212\u03bbC /z\nC(t, s) = h\u03c6(t, r)\u03c6(s, r)i = s fC\ns\n\u2212b\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhere \u03c6(t, r) is the order-parameter at time t and location r and h is the conjugate\nmagnetic field. These dynamical scaling forms (1.1,1.2) are expected to hold in the\nscaling limit where both t, s \u226b tmicro and also t \u2212 s \u226b tmicro , where tmicro is some\nmicroscopic reference time. In writing those, it is implicitly assumed that the underlying\ndynamics is such that there is a single relevant length-scale L = L(t) \u223c t1/z , where z\nis the dynamical critical exponent. Universality classes of ageing are defined through\nthe values of the non-equilibrium exponents a, b, \u03bbC , \u03bbR . for a non-vanishing initial\nvalue of the order-parameter, it is known that \u03bbC,R may be related to the slip exponent\nintroduced in [1] but there are no scaling relations with equilibrium exponents. For\nreviews, see e.g. [2, 3, 4, 5, 6].\nA lot of attention has been devoted to the case where the underlying dynamics\nis such that there are no macroscopic conservation laws and in particular the orderparameter is non-conserved. In this situation, which is appropriate for the description\nof the ageing of magnets, results for the exponents a, b, \u03bbC , \u03bbR have been derived.\nFurthermore, it appears that simple dynamical scaling can be extended to a local scaleinvariance, where the response functions transform covariantly under more general timedependent rescalings of time and space [8]. In particular, this leads to explicit predictions\nfor the scaling functions fR (y) (and also for fC (y) if z = 2) which have been tested and\nconfirmed in a large variety of systems, see [7] for a recent review.\nIn this paper, we are interested in carrying out a first case-study on the ageing and\nits local scale-invariance when the order-parameter is conserved. Physically, this may\ndescribe the phase-separation of binary alloys, where the order-parameter is given by\nthe concentration difference of the two kinds of atoms. Another example are kinetic\ngrowth-processes at surfaces when mass conservation holds. One of the most simple\n\n\fPhase-separation in the critical spherical model\n\n3\n\nmodels of this kind is the Mullins-Herring model [9, 10], which leads to a dynamical\nexponent z = 4 and has recently been discussed in detail in [11].\nPresently, there exist very few studies on ageing with a conserved order-parameter.\nIn a numerical study of the 2D Ising model quenched to T < Tc , where z = 3,\nGodr\u00e8che, Krzakala and Ricci-Tersenghi [12] calculated the scaling function fC (y) which\n\u2032\nremarkably shows a cross-over between a first power-law decay fC (y) \u223c y \u2212\u03bbC /z for\nintermediate values of y to the final asymptotic behaviour (1.2) for y \u226b 1. They find a\nvalue of \u03bb\u2032C = 2.5, whereas the value for \u03bbC is much smaller with \u03bbC = 1. On the other\nhand, Sire [13] calculated fC (y) exactly in the critical spherical model (T = Tc ), where\nz = 4, and found a single power-law regime.\u2021 For a review, see [4].\nHere, we shall revisit the spherical model with a conserved order-parameter,\nquenched to T = Tc . Besides reviewing the calculation of the two-time correlation\nfunction we shall also provide the exact solution for the two-time response function. This\nwill be described in section 2. Our main focus will be to show how these exact results can\nbe understood from an extension of dynamical scaling to local scale-invariance (LSI) with\nz = 4. In section 3, we recall the main results of LSI for that case and in particular write\ndown a linear partial differential equation of which this LSI is a dynamical symmetry.\nIn section 4, we consider the Langevin equation which describes the kinetics with a\nconserved order-parameter (model B in the Halperin-Hohenberg classification) and show\nfor the case at hand how the Langevin-equation can be split into a 'deterministic' and a\n'noise' part, so that all averages to be calculated can be exactly reduced to quantities to\nbe found in a noise-less theory. Local scale-invariance directly determines the latter, as\nwe shall see in section 5, where we can finally compare with the exact spherical model\nresults of section 2. This is, together with the earlier study of the Mullins-Herring\nmodel in [11], the first example where local scale-invariance can be confirmed for an\nexactly solvable model with dynamical exponent z 6= 2. Our conclusions are formulated\nin section 6. Some technical points are reported in the appendices. In appendix A\nwe derive the two-point function from the symmetry operators and in appendix B we\ncalculate solution of an integral which appears frequently in our computations. In an\noutlook beyond the present specific context, we discuss in appendix C the autoresponse\nfunction for values of z different from 4. In appendix D we discuss the most simple\npossible model, namely a free particle submitted to conserved noise. This serves as\na further illustration of some of the space-time properties of the conserved spherical\nmodel.\n\u2021 It is well-known that the spherical model with conserved order-parameter quenched to below Tc\nshows a multiscaling which is not captured by the simple scaling form (1.2) [14]. It is understood that\nthis is a peculiarity of the n \u2192 \u221e limit of the conserved O(n) vector-model [15].\n\n\fPhase-separation in the critical spherical model\n\n4\n\n2. The spherical model with a conserved order-parameter\nThe spherical model was conceived in 1953 by Berlin and Kac as a mathematical model\nfor strongly interacting spins which is yet easily solvable and it has indeed served a\nuseful r\u00f4le in providing exact results in a large variety of interesting physical situations.\nIt may be defined in terms of a real spin variable S(t, x) attached to each site x of a\nhypercubic lattice \u039b \u2282 Zd and depending on time t, subject to the (mean) spherical\nconstraint\n+\n*\nX\n(2.1)\nS(t, x)2 = N\nx\u2208\u039b\n\nP\nwhere N is the number of sites of the lattice. The Hamiltonian is H = \u2212 (x,y) SxSy\nwhere the sum is over pairs of nearest neighbours. The kinetics is assumed to be given\nby a Langevin equation of model B type\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2202t S(t, x) = \u2212\u22072x \u22072xS(t, x) + z(t)S(t, x) + h(t, x) + \u03b7(t, x)\n(2.2)\nwhere z(t) is the Lagrange multiplier fixed by the mean spherical constraint\u00a7 and the\ncoupling to the heat bath with the critical temperature Tc is described by a Gaussian\nnoise \u03b7 of vanishing average and variance\nh\u03b7(t, x)\u03b7(t\u2032 , x\u2032 )i = \u22122Tc \u22072x\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 )\u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 ).\n\n(2.3)\n\nand h(t, x) is a small external magnetic field.k Here the derivative on the right-hand side\nof (2.3) expresses the fact that the noise is chosen in such a way that it does not break\nthe conservation law. On the other hand, there are physical situations such as surface\ngrowth with mass conservation, where this is not the case. The non-conserved MullinsHerring model [9, 10] is given by equation (2.2) with z = 0 and the noise correlator\nh\u03b7(t, x)\u03b7(t\u2032 , x\u2032 )i = 2Tc \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 )\u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 ), see [11] for details. Here we shall study the\nconserved Mullins-Herring model, that is equation (2.2) with z(t) = 0 and the noise\ncorrelator (2.3). A similar remark applies on the way we included the perturbation\nh(t, x). Here we study the case, where the perturbation does not break the conservation\nlaw.\nThe spherical constraint is taken into account through the Lagrange multiplier\nz(t) which has to be computed self-consistently. These equations have already been\nconsidered several times in the literature [18, 19, 13].\n\u00a7 Considering the spherical constraint in the mean simplifies the calculations and should not affect the\nscaling behaviour. See [16] for a careful study of this point in the non-conserved case.\nk Since we are only interested in averages of local quantities and the initial magnetisation is assumed\nto vanish, this description is sufficient and we need not consider the analogue of the more elaborate\nequations studied by Annibale and Sollich [17] for the non-conserved case.\n\n\f5\n\nPhase-separation in the critical spherical model\n2.1.

For y sufficiently large, the above condition is also approximately\nsatisfied. In any case, in the limit y \u2192 \u221e we can read off the autocorrelation exponent\n\u03bbC = d + 2.\n\nThe scaling behaviour of the spatio-temporal two-time correlator is illustrated in\nfigure 1. We see that for relatively small values of y = t/s, the correlation function does\nnot decay monotonously towards zero, but rather displays oscillations whose amplitude\ndecays with |r|s\u22121/4 . This behaviour is quite close to the well-known one for the equaltime correlation function. As y increases, these oscillations become less pronounced.\nThere is no apparent qualitative difference between the cases d < 4 and d > 4.\n2.2.

For gd 6= 0 it is more convenient to use the integral\nrepresentation (2.14). In figure 2 we display the spatio-temporal response function.\nIn contrast to the non-conserved case for a fixed value of y = t/s there are decaying\noscillations with the scaling variable |r|s\u22121/4 . These oscillations disappear rapidly when\ny is increased. This qualitative behaviour also arises, as we show in appendix D, for the\nsimple random walk with a conserved noise.\nHaving found both correlation and response functions, we can also calculate the\nfluctuation-dissipation ratio X(t, s) = T R(t, s)(\u2202C(t, s)/\u2202s)\u22121 which measures the\ndistance from equilibrium [21].

Symmetries of the deterministic equation\nBefore we can examine dynamical symmetries in Langevin equations, we need some\nbackground material on the dynamical symmetries of the deterministic part of such\nequations. Therefore, we recall in this section first some facts about Schr\u00f6dingerinvariance which describes an extension of dynamical scaling for a dynamical exponent\nz = 2. As shown earlier [8], an analogous extension can be built for z 6= 2 and we shall\nwrite down the relevant generators for this local scale-invariance for z = 4.\nThe physical starting point is the covariance of n-point functions such as the\ncorrelator F (n) (t1 , . . . , tn ; r1 , . . . , rn , ) = h\u03c61 (t1 , r 1 ) . . . , \u03c6n (tn , r n )i under the rescaling\nof spatial and temporal coordinates\nF (n) (bz t1 , . . . , bz tn ; br 1 , . . . , br n ) = b\u2212(x1 +...+xn ) F (n) (t1 , . . . tn ; r 1 , . . . , rn )\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere the xi are the scaling dimensions of the fields \u03c6i and z is the dynamical exponent.\nBy analogy with conformal invariance at equilibrium, one asks whether an extension of\ndynamical scaling to local scale-transformations with a space-time dependent rescaling\nfactor b(t, r) might be possible. The most simple case is the one of Schr\u00f6dingerinvariance which describes the dynamical symmetries of the linear diffusion equation\n(or free Schr\u00f6dinger equation)\n\u015csch \u03c6(r, t) = 0,\n\n1\nwith \u015csch := \u03bb\u2202t \u2212 \u22072r\n4\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere the parameter \u03bb is related to the inverse diffusion constant. The symmetry group\nof this equation, that is the largest group of transformations carrying solutions of (3.2)\nto other solutions, was already found 1882 by Lie and is the well-known Schr\u00f6dinger\ngroup Sch(d), see [22]. It transforms coordinates as (t, r) 7\u2192 (t\u2032 , r \u2032 ) = g(t, r) with\nr\u2032 =\n\n\u03b1\u0303t + \u03b2\u0303\nRr + vt + a\n, t\u2032 =\n; \u03b1\u0303\u03b4\u0303 \u2212 \u03b2\u0303\u03b3\u0303 = 1\n\u03b3\u0303t + \u03b4\u0303\n\u03b3\u0303t + \u03b4\u0303\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere R is a rotation matrix and v, a, \u03b1\u0303, \u03b2\u0303, \u03b3\u0303 and \u03b4\u0303 are parameters. Evidently, the\ndynamical exponent is z = 2. The solutions of (3.2) transform as\n\u03c6(t, r) \u2192 (Tg \u03c6)(t, r) = fg [g \u22121 (t, r)]\u03c6(g \u22121(t, r))\n\n(3.4)\n\nwhere the companion function fg is known explicitly [22]. A field transforming as (3.4)\nis called quasiprimary. The generators of the Schr\u00f6dinger group form a Lie algebra\nschd = Lie(Sch(d)) and it can be shown that a n-point correlator built from quasiprimary\nfields must satisfy the conditions\nn\nX\ni=1\n\nXi h\u03c61 (t1 , r1 ) . . . \u03c6n (tn , r n )i = 0\n\n(3.5)\n\n\f10\n\nPhase-separation in the critical spherical model\n\nwhere Xi stands for any generator of schd which acts on the field \u03c6i . For example,\neq. (3.5) fixes the two-point function of quasiprimary fields completely [23].\nFollowing [8], we now write the generalisation of this to the case when z = 4 which\nhas already been started in [11].

Here, the generators X\u00b11,0 correspond to projective\n(i)\nchanges in the time t, the generators Yn\u22121/4 are space-translations, generalised Galileitransformations and so on and R(i,j) are spatial rotations.

The operator (\u22072r )\u22121 can then be defined formally as follows. For\nexample, in d = 2 dimensions, we have\n(\u22072r )\u22121\n\n:=\n\n(\u2202r2x\n\n+\n\n\u2202r2y )\u22121\n\n:=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(\u22121)n \u2202r\u22122\u22122n\n\u2202r2n\nx\ny\n\n(3.9)\n\nn=0\n\nThe remaining negative powers of \u2207r are then defined by concatenation, e.g. (\u22072r )\u22122 =\n(\u22072r )\u22121 * (\u22072r )\u22121 . We easily verify the following commutation relations for n \u2208 Z\n[(\u22072r )n , ri ] = n \u2202ri (\u22072r )n\u22121\n\n(3.10)\n\n[(\u22072r )n , r2 ] = 2n (r * \u2202r ) (\u22072r )n\u22121 + n (n \u2212 2 + d)(\u22072r)n\u22121\n\n(3.11)\n\nThe generators eq.

Then the factor exp(\u2212J0 [\u03c6, \u03c6])\nwith an antidiagonal matrix A. From this, two important facts can be deduced:\n\n(i) Wick's Theorem holds [30]. That is, we can write the 2n-point function as\nD\nE\nX\n\u03c6(t1 , r1 ) . . . \u03c62n (t2n , r2n ) =\n(4.10)\n0\nall possible pairings\nP of 1, 2, . . . , 2n\nD\nE\nD\nE\n\u03c6P1 (tP1 , r P1 )\u03c6P2 (tP2 , r P2 ) . . . \u03c6P2n\u22121 (tP2n\u22121 , r P2n\u22121 )\u03c6P2n (tP2n , rP2n )\n0\n\n(ii) We have the statement\n*\n\n\u03c6 . . . \u03c6 \u03c6e . . . \u03c6e\n| {z } | {z }\nn\n\nm\n\n+\n\n0\n\n=0\n\n(4.11)\n\n0\n\nunless n = m. This is due to the antidiagonal structure of A and can be seen\nby performing the Gaussian integral (see for instance [26], chapter 4) explicitly\nand taking care of the fact, that the inverse matrix A\u22121 is antidiagonal again.\nFormally, eq. (4.11) is analogous to the Bargman superselection rule which is used\nin Schr\u00f6dinger-invariant theories with z = 2 [28].\nWith these tools at hand we cam demonstrate, quite analogous to the non-conserved case\n[28] an exact reduction of any average to an average computed only with the noiseless\ntheory. For example, for the two-time response function, we have\nE\nD\nE D\nD\nE\ne\n\u2212Jb [\u03c6]\ne\ne\ne\nR(t, s) = \u03c6(t)\u03c6(s)\n= \u03c6(t)\u03c6(s)e\n= \u03c6(t)\u03c6(s)\n(4.12)\n0\n\n0\n\nIn going to the last line, we have expanded the exponential and use that because of\nWick's theorem any 2n-point function can rewritten as a sum over a product of n twotime functions which in turn are determined by the Bargman rules. From the special\ne it follows that only a single term of the entire series remains. As a\nstructure of Jb [\u03c6]\nconsequence, the two-time response function does not depend explicitly on the noise. A\n\n\fPhase-separation in the critical spherical model\n\n14\n\nsimilar result holds for the correlation function, see section 5. We shall now first consider\nthe noise-free theory and find the two-point function from the dynamical symmetry.\nAfterwards, we shall show that the two-point functions of the full noisy theory can be\nreconstructed from this case.\n4.2. The response function of the noise-free theory\nFirst, we consider the linear response function of the order-parameter with respect to\nan external magnetic field h\nR(t, s; x \u2212 y) :=\n\n\u03b4h\u03c6(t, x)i\n\u03b4h(s, y)\n\n(4.13)\nh=0\n\nAs already mentioned in the previous section, we choose here, and in contrast to [11],\na perturbation respecting the conservation law, which means that we have to add the\nR\nterm \u22072Rh to the Langevin equation (4.1) or the term dRdu h\u22072R\u03c6e to the action (4.3).\nThen it is easy to see that the response function (4.13) is given by\nE\nD\n2e\n(4.14)\nR(t, s; x \u2212 y) = \u03c6(t, x)\u2207y \u03c6(s, y)\nWe make the important assumption that the field \u03c6(t, r), characterised by the\nparameters \u03bb and \u03b3 and the scaling dimension x, is quasiprimary. As suggested in\ne r) to be quasiprimary, with parameters\n[8, 28] we consider also the response field \u03c6(t,\ne = \u2212\u03bb and e\n\u03bb\n\u03b3 = \u2212\u03b3 but the same scaling dimension x\ne = x.\n\nWe can concentrate on the model with v = 0 for the following reason: Suppose\n\u03c6(r, t) is a solution of equation (4.1) with \u03b7 = 0. Then we define\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ t\n1\n2\n\u03a8(t, r) := exp\nd\u03c4 v(\u03c4 )\u2207r \u03c6(t, r).\n(4.15)\n16\u03bb 0\n\u03a8(t, r) fulfils the following dynamical equation\n\u2202t \u03a8(t, r) =\n\n1 4\n\u2207 \u03a8(t, r),\n16\u03bb r\n\n(4.16)\n\nwhich is the same equation with v = 0. If suffices thus to consider the problem with\nv = 0 and then to apply the inverse of the gauge transformation (4.15) for treating the\ncase v 6= 0. In this way, the breaking of time-translation invariance is implemented.\n4.3. The case v = 0\nThis case is relevant for d > 4 in the spherical model and for any d in the Mullins-Herring\nmodel. We compute (4.14) for the noise-free theory, taking translation-invariance into\naccount. Then the response function is given by\nR0 (t, s; r) = \u22072r F (2) (t, s, r)\n\n(4.17)\n\n\f15\n\nPhase-separation in the critical spherical model\n\nwhere the two-point function F (2) (t, s, r) has been computed in the last section.

From [31, 32], one knows the asymptotic behaviour of\nthe hypergeometric functions. In general, there is an infinite series of terms growing\n\n\f16\n\nPhase-separation in the critical spherical model\n\nexponentially with u, together with terms falling off algebraically. The leading term of\nthe exponentially growing series can be eliminated by imposing the following condition\non the coefficients\n\u0393( 23 )\u0393( 12 + d4 )\u0393(1 + d4 )\n\u0393( 1 )\u0393( d4 )\u0393( 21 + d4 )\n+\nc\n(4.26)\nc2 2\n4\n\u0393(1 + d4 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b3 )\n\u0393( 23 + d4 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b3 )\n+ c2\u2212d\n\n\u0393(1 \u2212 d4 )\u0393( 32 \u2212 d4 )\u0393( 12 )\n\u0393( 23 \u2212 d4 )\u0393(2 \u2212 d4 )\u0393( 23 )\n+\nc\n=0\n4\u2212d\n\u0393(2 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b3 )\n\u0393( 23 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b3 )\n\nHere, some of the constants b\ncs might have to be set to zero, if the corresponding value\nof s is not admissible. Indeed, the condition (4.26) is sufficient to cancel the entire\nexponentially growing series and the remaining part decreases algebraically, but we\nshall not prove this here. The most important case for us is c2\u2212d = c4\u2212d = 0.

Here we check only that our\ntheory is in line with the exact results of the conserved spherical model as derived in\n\u0393( d + 1 )\nsection 2. If we choose c2 = \u2212 \u0393 d +4 3 \u22122 \u03b3 c24 and c2\u2212d = c4\u2212d = 0, we have seen in the last\n(4 2 \u03bb)\nsubsection that the expression \u2207r 2 F (2) (t, s, r) can be written as an integral (see (4.27)).\nOn this integral representation, we apply formula (4.28). We also recall the fact that\n2\nexp(\u03bet,s \u22072r )eikr = eikr\u2212\u03bet,sk . It then follows from a straightforward computation that\nthe result (2.14) is reproduced correctly for \u03ba0 = \u2212gd .\n\n\f18\n\nPhase-separation in the critical spherical model\n5.

Our symmetry-based approach has thus reproduced all the results\n\u03bb\nfrom section 2, up to an identification of parameters.\n\n\fPhase-separation in the critical spherical model\n\n20\n\n6. Conclusion\nCurrent studies on non-equilibrium systems often concentrate on the scaling aspects,\nsince then universality may be used to justify the analysis of rather artificial-looking\nmodels in order to obtain physical insight. In this work, we have been exploring the\nidea that dynamical scaling might be generalisable to a larger algebraic structure of\nlocal scale-transformations. This kind of prediction is most conveniently tested through\nthe form of the two-time response functions and, since the form of the autoresponse\nfunction contains the dynamic exponent z only in combination with other exponents,\nthe scaling form of the space-time response function will provide non-trivial information\nabout how to construct local scale-transformation beyond the case z = 2 which by now\nis rather well understood. Since values of z quite distinct from two can be obtained\nfor a conserved order-parameter, this motivated our choice to study the kinetics of such\nsystems. The spherical model, quenched to T = Tc from a fully disordered initial state\nand the Mullins-Herring model with conserved noise are useful first tests, since their\nscaling behaviour is non-trivial, yet the models do remain analytically treatable.\nBy looking for generalised local scale-transformation, it might appear at first sight\nthat the non-invariance of a stochastic Langevin equation under such transformations\nwould make such a programme futile. However, generalizing a technique from\nSchr\u00f6dinger-invariance (which applies for example to phase-ordering kinetics with a\nnon-conserved order-parameter [28]), we have shown that also in the conserved case one\ncan decompose the Langevin equation into a deterministic part which does admit larger\nsymmetries and a noise part which breaks them. This decomposition is such that all\ninteresting averages can be exactly reduced to averages calculable from the deterministic\npart of the theory. We have shown that this decomposition can be carried out in the\ncritical spherical model and did confirm that the predictions obtained for the two-time\nresponse and correlation functions are fully compatible with the exactly known results\nin the spherical model. Together with the Mullins-Herring growth model, these are the\nfirst analytically solved examples which confirm LSI for a dynamical exponent z = 4.\u2217\nIn table 1 we collect the values of the exponents of the conserved spherical model and\nthe conserved and the non-conserved Mullins-Herring models. For comparison we also\nlist some of the values for the exponents of the bond-diluted 2D Ising-model, for which\nit was shown that the autoresponse function is in agreement with LSI [33].\nThat confirmation was possible because the deterministic part of the Langevin\nequation is still a linear equation. Numerical simulations in models where this is no\nlonger so will inform us to what extent LSI with z 6= 2 can be confirmed in a more\ngeneral context. At the same time, it will be necessary to derive a generalisation of the\nBargman superselection rules in order to have a model-independent justification of the\ndecomposition of the Langevin equation. Work along these lines is in progress.\n\u2217 Another example of a system with a dynamical exponent far from 2 which appears to be compatible\nwith LSI is the bond-diluted 2D Ising-model quenched to T < Tc [33].\n\n\fPhase-separation in the critical spherical model\nmodel\ncons. spherical\ncons.

Note however that for certain values of s and \u03b3/\u03bb these factors might be\nzero so that the corresponding solution vanishes, see below for the free-field case. The\ncoefficients as given in (A29) will be used in the main text to determine the response\nfunction. Let us collect however some facts about the solutions \u03c6(s) (u), as this might\nbe relevant for models with non-conserving perturbations.\n\u2022 To be physically acceptable, the solutions have to be regular for u \u2192 0 and vanishing for u \u2192 \u221e. The solutions belonging to s \u2208 {0, 2, 4} are indeed regular for\nu \u2192 0. However, the solution for s \u2208 {4 \u2212 d, 2 \u2212 d} are not regular for d > 4 and\nhave to be dropped for this case (for even d they where anyway excluded for d > 4).\nFor the same reason, the solution for s = 2 \u2212 d has to be abandoned for d > 2.\n(4)\n\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\nFurthermore, we have b\u0303l = b\u0303l+1 and b\u03030 = 0, so that, up to a constant, the solution\n\u03c6(4) (u) equals \u03c6(0) (u). Therefore, we drop the solution belonging to s = 0. The\ngeneral solution is then\nX\n\u03c6(u) =\ncs \u03c6(s) (u)\n(A31)\ns\u2208E \u2032\n\n\f25\n\nPhase-separation in the critical spherical model\nwith\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nif d > 4\n\uf8f2 {2, 4}\n\u2032\nE :=\n{2, 4, 4 \u2212 d}\nif 2 < d \u2264 4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 {2, 4, 2 \u2212 d, 4 \u2212 d} if d \u2264 2\n\n\u2022 For free-field theories, there is\n(see (A29)).\n\n\u03b3\n\u03bb\n\n(A32)\n\n= 12 .

Hence, not all of the coefficients cs\nneed to be independent, but they have to be arranged in such a way as to achieve\nthis asymptotic behaviour.\nAppendix B.

The response function in the scaling regime\nWe reconsider equation (4.33) and consider the different cases implied by \u0325.\n\u2022 \u0325 = 21 \u21d4 z = 4 . This case in fact corresponds to the conserved spherical model. In\nthis case both g (2) (t, s) and g (4) (t, s) depend only on the ratio t/s and the argument\n(4.35) of the hypergeometric functions tends to one for y \u2192 \u221e.

Conserved random walk\nConceivably the most simple ageing system is the well-known Brownian particle,\ndescribed by a Langevin equation only containing the noise and the external perturbing\nfield [21]. Here we extend their idea to a conserved order-parameter \u03c6 and consider the\nfollowing model, described by the Langevin equation\n\u2202t \u03c6(t, x) = \u2212\u22072xh(t, x) + \u03b7(t, x)\n\n(D1)\n\nwhere the \u03b7 is the same kind of noise (2.3) as in the main text and h is an external field.\nThe solution of the model is promptly found and we obtain, where as usual r = x \u2212 y\nR(t, s; r) = \u2212 (\u22072r \u03b4(r))\u0398(t \u2212 s)\n\nC(t, s; r) = C(0, 0; r) \u2212 2T (\u22072r\u03b4(r))min(t, s)\n\n(D2)\n(D3)\n\nwhere the initial term C(0, 0; r) can be dropped in the scaling limit. The limit\nfluctuation-dissipation ratio is X\u221e = 1/2. As in the non-conserved case [21], an\nequilibrium state is never reached.\n\n\fPhase-separation in the critical spherical model\n\n28\n\nThe difference to the non-conserved case is that the space-dependence is described\nby a second derivative of a Delta-function instead of a simple delta-function. In order\nto better understand the meaning of this result, we return to a lattice discretization\nof the model. Then \u03b4(r) goes over to a Kronecker delta \u03b4r,0 and the second derivative\nbecomes a discrete difference. We illustrate the result in one space dimension\nR(t, s; r) = \u0398(t \u2212 s) (2\u03b4r,0 \u2212 \u03b4r+1,0 \u2212 \u03b4r\u22121,0 )\n\nC(t, s; r) = 2T min(t, s) (2\u03b4r,0 \u2212 \u03b4r+1,0 \u2212 \u03b4r\u22121,0 )\n\n(D4)\n(D5)\n\nThen, for t > s, R(t, s; 0) = 2 is a local maximum, while R(t, s; \u00b11) = \u22121 would\ncorrespond to local minima. This is qualitatively similar to the form of R(t, s; r) seen\nin figure 2 for the conserved spherical model.\nAcknowledgements: We thank A. J. Bray, C. Godr\u00e8che and S.
