In this note we improve an algorithm from a recent paper\nby Bauer and Bennett for computing a function of Erd\u00f6s that measures the\nminimal gap size f (k) in the sequence of integers at least one of whose prime\nfactors exceeds k. This allows us to compute values of f (k) for larger k and\nobtain new values of f (k).\nKeywords Pell equation, Compact representations, Smooth numbers\nMathematics subject classification (2000) 11N25, 11D09.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nFor any integer m we let P (m) be the largest prime factor of m with the\nconvention P (0) = P (\u00b11) = 1. Let \u03a0n,k be the product of k consecutive\nintegers, starting with n, i.e.\n\u03a0n,k = n(n + 1) * * * (n + k \u2212 1).\nBy a theorem of Sylvester (see [15]) \u03a0n,k is divisible by a prime p > k\nwhenever n > k, and thus, following Erd\u00f6s [7], we define f (k) to be the least\ninteger with the property that\n\u0001\nP \u03a0n,f (k) > k,\n\nif n > k. Standard heuristics for the size of gaps between consecutive primes\nlead one to expect that order of magnitude of f (k) is (log k)2 .\nThe following table gives known values of f (k):\nk\nf (k)\n1\n1\n2\n2\n3\u22124\n3\n5 \u2212 12\n4\n\nk\nf (k)\nk\nf (k)\n13 \u2212 40\n6\n61 \u2212 113\n14\n41 \u2212 46\n7\n114\n13\n47 \u2212 58\n8\n115 \u2212 150 12\n59 \u2212 60\n9\n151 \u2212 178 14\n\nThe values of f (k) for k \u2264 10 were computed by Utz [16] and extended to\nk \u2264 42 by Lehmer [11], to k \u2264 46 by Ecklund and Eggleton [4], to k \u2264 73\nby Ecklund, Eggleton and Selfridge [5], [6] and finally to k \u2264 178 by Bauer\n1\n\n\fand Bennett [1]. Bauer and Bennett in the same paper also disproved an\nassertion of Utz that f is monotone.\nIn this paper we compute the values of f (k) for k \u2264 268. Our results can\nbe summarized in the following theorem.\nTheorem 1. For 179 \u2264 k \u2264 268 the values of f (k) are as follows:\nk\nf (k)\n179 \u2212 222 14\n223 \u2212 268 16\nNote that Bauer and Bennett, although greatly extending the set of k\nsuch that f (k) is known, by 105 values of k, did not find any values of f (k)\nsuch that f (k) > 14. In Theorem 1 we find the new largest proven value of\nf (k), the first after nearly 40 years (the previous being [6]).\n\n2\n\nThe algorithm\n\nLemher [10] searched for two consecutive smooth integers, satisfying P (z(z +\n1)) \u2264 pt , where pt is the t-th prime. One can write x = 2z + 1 and see that\nP (z(z + 1)) \u2264 pt iff P (x2 \u2212 1) \u2264 pt . Writing x2 \u2212 1 = dy 2, where d is\nsquarefree, leads to the Pell equation\nx2 \u2212 dy 2 = 1,\n\n(1)\n\n\u221a\nwhere P (dy) \u2264 pt . This implies that the solutions\u221ax + y d we are searching\nfor are powers of the fundamental solution u + v d, i.e\n\u221a\n\u221a\nx + y d = (u + v d)n .\nBy classic results on primitive divisors (see [3]) and the work of Lehmer (see\n[9]), if we want P (y) \u2264 pt , then\n\u001a\n\u001b\npt + 1\nn \u2264 max\n, 12 .\n2\nThus one needs to consider only finitely many Pell equations and for each\none only some of the first solutions.\nAfter finding all pairs of smooth consecutive integers in this way, one can\nsearch through the results and find larger strings of consecutive integers.\nBauer and Bennett [1] improve on this strategy by the following clever\nargument: for fixed m \u2264 3 and t suppose we are searching for all integers n\nsatisfying\nP (\u03a0n,m) \u2264 pt .\n(2)\n2\n\n\fWe can split the indices 0, . . . , m \u2212 1 into \u230a m4 \u230b + \u230a m+1\n\u230b disjoint pairs\n4\n(i, i + 2), where i \u2261 0, 1 (mod 4). Set t0 = \u03c0(m \u2212 1). By the Dirichlet\nprinciple, we can find an index i such that (n + i)(n + i + 2) is divisible by\nat most\n\u0016\n\u0017\nt \u2212 t0\nN=\n\u230a m4 \u230b + \u230a m+1\n\u230b\n4\n\nof the primes from the set\n\n{pt0 +1 , . . . , pt }.\n\n(3)\n\nNow one writes X = n + i + 1 and Y = (n + i)(n + i + 2), and gets\nX 2 \u2212 DY 2 = 1,\nwhere D is squarefree and divisible only by some of the first t0 primes and at\nmost N of the primes from the set (3). Then one proceeds exactly as Lehmer,\nwith the difference that in this approach P (X) \u2264 pt also has to hold. This\nlowers the number of Pell equations one needs to consider from 2t \u2212 1 to\n\u0013\nN \u0012\nX\nt \u2212 t0\n,\nM = \u22121 + 2\nj\nj=0\nt0\n\nand equally important, reduces the size of the Pell equations.\nThe bottleneck of both the algortihms of Lehmer and Bauer and Bennett\nis solving the Pell equation. The main difficulty in solving the Pell equation\nis the size of the solutions, as it grows exponentially with respect to the size\nof the coefficient d form (1). This means that just writing down the solution\nin standard representation takes exponential time. In [12], Luca and the\nauthor used compact representations of the solutions to the Pell equations to\novercome this difficulty and managed to extend Lehmer's results (see also [14]\nfor another application of this approach). Note that the algorithm described\nin [12] is still the best up to date if one wants to find 2 or 3 consecutive\nsmooth integers.\n\u221a\nA compact representation of an algebraic number \u03b2 \u2208 Q( d) is a representation of \u03b2 of the form\nk\nY\nj\n\u03b2=\n\u03b1j2 ,\n(4)\n\u221a\n\nj=1\n\nwhere \u03b1j = (aj + bj d)/cj , where aj , bj , cj , k \u2208 Z, and there exist polynomial\n(in log d) upper bounds for k, aj , bj and cj . A detailed description of compact\nrepresentations and their use can be found in [8]. Using compact representations, the Pell equation is solved in two steps. First, the regulator of the\n3\n\n\fappropriate quadratic field is computed. Once the regulator is known, one\ncomputes a compact representation, in polynomial time. By far the harder\npart of this process is the computation of the regulator. The fastest unconditional algorithms are still exponential with respect to d, while the fastest\nknown algorithm, Buchmann's subexponential algorithm (see [2]), depends\non the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis.\nFor our purposes, the only algorithm fast enough is Buchmann's algorithm. We will perform a check, using continued fractions, that will for each\ncase tell us either that the output of Buchmann's algorithm is unconditionally\ncorrect or that we can disregard this case. This implies that, although we\ncannot unconditionally solve the Pell equation in subexponential time, we\ncan determine unconditionally whether it has a smooth solution (and find\nany smooth solutions) in subexponential time.\nWe do this by the following method, first used in [12]: suppose we want\nto find the solutions of x2 \u2212 dy 2 = 1, where x and y are n-smooth\n\u221a (d is a\nfixed n-smooth integer). We first compute the regulator Rd of Q( d) using\nBuchmann's subexponential algorithm. As mentioned, the correctness of the\noutput Rd is dependent on the GRH, but what is unconditionally true is\nthat the output is equal to mRd , where m is some positive integer. From the\nobtained value we construct, in polynomial time, a compact representation of\nthe m-th power of the fundamental\n\u221a unit, and from it a compact representation\nof the m-th solution xm + ym d of our Pell equation. We define z to be the\nn-smooth part of ym , which is computed using the algorithm for performing\nmodular arithmetic\n\u221a on compact representations from [13].\nLet \u221a\nx1 + y1 d be\u221athe fundamental solution of our Pell equation and\nxk + yk d = (x1 + y1 d)k . If the GRH is false and Buchmann's algorithm\ndoes not return the exact value of the regulator this will mean that it might\nhappen that we will miss some smooth solutions of our equation. Suppose\nthis happens. This means that m > 1 and yk is n-smooth for some k that\nis not a multiple of m. But we have y1 |yk , so y1 is also n-smooth, implying\ny1 |z (because y1 |ym ). This obviously implies y1 \u2264 z. So if something has\ngone wrong, we will find the solution y1 that is smaller or equal to z and\nstrictly smaller than ym . We can use continued fractions to check whether\nsuch a y1 exists. If we do not find such a y1 (and indeed we never do, as it's\nexistence would disprove the GRH), it means either m = 1 or m > 1 but we\nare not missing a smooth solution. In any case, this removes the dependence\nof our results on the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. Note that although\nym does become very large, z in practice does not. This means that it is\nusually, for our purposes,\nenough to compute the first 10 or so convergents of\n\u221a\nthe expansion of d to a continued fraction, to prove that the hypothetical\ny1 does not exist.\n4\n\n\fUsing compact representation, in combination with this check, cuts down\nthe space needed from exponential to polynomial with respect to d and the\ntime needed to solve the Pell equation from exponential to subexponential.\nIn essence, in this paper we combine the clever approach of [1] and the\npowerful methods for finding smooth solutions of the Pell equations from\n[12].\nIt is worth noting the somewhat counter\u2013intuitive implications of the\nmentioned algorithms: it is easier to solve the Pell equation (using compact\nrepresentations) than it is to write down the solution in decimal notation, and\nit is easier to unconditionally find all smooth solutions of the Pell equation\nor determine that there are none (this takes subexponential time) than it is\nto unconditionally solve the Pell equation (this takes exponential time).\n\n3\n\nResults\n\nWe run our algorithm for two pairs of parameters (m, t), these pairs being\n(47, 14), and (56, 16). Note thet p47 = 211, p56 = 263 and P (\u03a0318,13 ) = 163,\nP (\u03a01330,15 ) = 223, implying\nf (k) \u2265 14 for 178 \u2264 k \u2264 223 and f (k) \u2265 16 for 224 \u2264 k \u2264 268\n\n(5)\n\nBy proving that there is no integer n > k for 178 \u2264 k \u2264 222 satisfying\nP (\u03a0n,14 ) \u2264 k implies f (k) = 14 for 178 \u2264 k \u2264 222. In the same way one\nproves that f (k) = 16 for 223 \u2264 k \u2264 268.\nThe case (m, t) = (47, 14) makes us solve\nM1 = \u22121 + 2\n\n6\n\n6 \u0012 \u0013\nX\n41\n\nj\n\nj=0\n\n= 342948991\n\nPell equations, while the case (m, t) = (56, 16) makes us solve\nM2 = \u22121 + 2\n\n6\n\n6 \u0012 \u0013\nX\n50\n\nj\n\nj=0\n\n= 1168680703\n\nPell equations.\nWe obtain that there do not exist such integers n, thus proving Theorem 1.\nAcknowledgements.\nThese materials are based on work financed by the National Foundation for\nScience, Higher Education and Technological Development of the Republic\nof Croatia.\n5\n\n\fReferences\n[1] M.
