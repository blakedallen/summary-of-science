In this short note we show that the dual superconformal invariance\nof this object is also manifest. The geometry naturally suggests a partial integration\nand simple change of variable to an integral over G(k \u2212 2, n). This change of variable precisely corresponds to the mapping between usual momentum variables and the\n\"momentum twistors\" introduced by Hodges, and yields an elementary derivation of\nthe momentum-twistor space formula very recently presented by Mason and Skinner,\nwhich is manifestly dual superconformal invariant. Thus the G(k, n) Grassmannian\nformulation allows a direct understanding of all the important symmetries of N = 4\nSYM scattering amplitudes.\n\n\fRecently a simple formula has been conjectured for all leading singularities of N = 4\nSYM amplitudes [1]. Working in twistor space, the leading singularities of single trace, color\nstripped, n-particle Nk\u22122 MHV amplitudes are associated with the object\nZ\nk\nY\ndk\u00d7n C\u03b1a\n1\n\u03b4 4|4 (C\u03b1a Wa )\nLn;k =\nvol(GL(k))\n(C1 C2 * * * Ck ) * * * (Cn C1 * * * Ck\u22121) \u03b1=1\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\n(Cm1 * * * Cmk ) = \u01eb\u03b11 ***\u03b1k C\u03b11 m1 * * * C\u03b1k mk\n\n(2)\n\nare minors of the k \u00d7 n matrix C. Here a = 1, * * * , n labels the n external particles. The\nintegrand has a GL(k) \"gauge symmetry\" under which C\u03b1a \u2192 L\u03b2\u03b1 C\u03b2a for any k \u00d7 k matrix\nL, and so we have to \"gauge-fix\" by dividing by vol(GL(k)).\nGoing back to momentum space, the integral turns into a multi-dimensional contour integral. In [1], substantial evidence was given that the residues of the integrand provide a\nbasis for constructing tree amplitudes as well as 1- and 2-loop leading singularities. Multidimensional residue theorems give rise to a large number of remarkable identities between the\nresidues, which guarantee the equivalence of many different representations of the same amplitude and enforce the cancelation of non-local poles as well as consistent infrared structure\nat loop level. In [1], it was also shown that the action of cyclic, parity and superconformal\nsymmetries on eqn. (1) is manifest. In this short note we show that the dual superconformal\ninvariance [2, 3, 4] of eqn. (1) is also manifest.\nLet us immediately transform eqn. (1) back into momentum space\nZ\nZ\nY\ndk\u00d7n C\u03b1a\n1\n4\n2\n\u03b4 (C\u03b1a \u03b7\u0303a )\u03b4 (C\u03b1a \u03bb\u0303a ) d2\u03c1\u03b1 \u03b4 2 (\u03bba \u2212 C\u03b1a \u03c1\u03b1 )\nLn;k =\nvol(GL(k)) (C1 C2 * * * Ck ) * * * (Cn * * * Ck\u22121 ) \u03b1\n(3)\nIn this form the geometric character of the integral over C, already discussed in [1], is\ncompletely clear. The \u03bba , \u03bb\u0303a are 2-planes in the n-dimensional space, while C is a k-plane.\nThe integral is then over the space of k-planes in n-dimensions\u2013the Grassmannian G(k, n).\nThe first set of bosonic delta functions forces C to be orthogonal to the \u03bb\u0303 plane, while the\nsecond forces some linear combination of the k n\u2212vectors in C to equal \u03bb; in other words,\nthe k-plane C must also contain the 2-plane \u03bb. Note that these two requirements can be\nP\nsatisfied only if the \u03bb plane is orthogonal to the \u03bb\u0303 plane \u2013\n\u03bba \u03bb\u0303a = 0 \u2013 which is nothing\n\nother than the statement of momentum conservation1 .\nGiven that the C plane must contain the \u03bb plane, it is very natural to split C into\na part that literally is the \u03bb 2-plane, and only perform the integral over the remaining\n1\n\nNote that in writing eqn. (1) we are working with real variables in (2,2) signature, and in the n-dimensional\nspace there is a natural notion of \"orthogonality\" associated with the standard dot product. As discussed in\n[1], the final, fully gauge-fixed form of the expression for Ln;k is defined for arbitrary complex momenta.\n\n1\n\n\f(k \u2212 2) directions. This motivates us to try and write the resulting expression as an integral\nover G(k \u2212 2, n). This is essentially trivial \u2013 the only (minor) complication is that the\nminors appearing in eqn. (1) are k \u00d7 k minors, not (k \u2212 2) \u00d7 (k \u2212 2) minors. But from\nhigh-school algebra we are familiar with a natural linear transformation which maps the\nlarger minors to the smaller minors. As we will see this linear transformation takes us\nfrom the momentum variables to the \"momentum twistor\" variables recently introduced in a\nremarkable paper by Hodges [5]. The remaining integral over G(k \u2212 2, n) precisely yields the\nmomentum-twistor Grassmannian formula very recently presented by Mason and Skinner [6].\nThis expression is manifestly dual superconformal invariant. In this way momentum twistors\nand dual superconformal invariance are seen to follow very naturally from the Grassmannian\nformulation, and we see that eqn. (1) provides a simple understanding of all the important\nsymmetries of the theory.\nTo get started, let us turn to \"gauge-fixing\" the GL(k) symmetry, which we can do by\nintroducing a gauge-fixing function \u2206GL(k) which can in general be a function of C\u03b1a and \u03c1\u03b1 ,\nand writing\nZ\nZ\nY\ndk\u00d7n C\u03b1a \u2206GL(k)\n4\n2\n\u03b4 (C\u03b1a \u03b7\u0303a )\u03b4 (C\u03b1a \u03bb\u0303a ) d2 \u03c1\u03b1 \u03b4 2 (\u03bba \u2212 C\u03b1a \u03c1\u03b1 )\nLn;k =\n(C1 C2 * * * Ck ) * * * (Cn C1 * * * Ck\u22121) \u03b1\n(4)\nIn practice, we can choose \u2206GL(k) to be a product of k 2 delta functions fixing some components\nof C, \u03c1 to some canonical values. For instance in [1], we implicitly chose \u2206 to only depend on\nC, and used it to fix k of the columns of C to an orthonormal basis. This gauge-fixing was\nconvenient for showing the parity invariance of Ln;k , as well as making the connection between\neqn. (1) and the \"link representation\" of [7]. In this note we will find another gauge-fixing\nconvenient, the analog of which was already used in [1] in the discussion of MHV amplitudes.\nSince our ultimate goal is to be left with an integral over k \u2212 2 planes, we wish to start\nby only partially gauge-fixing, leaving a GL(k \u2212 2) to be fixed only at the end. Therefore,\nwe start by imposing k 2 \u2212 (k \u2212 2)2 = 4k \u2212 4 = 2k + 2(k \u2212 2) conditions. In other words we\nwill write\n\u2206GL(k) = \u2206GL(k)\u2192GL(k\u22122)\u00d7T2 \u00d7 \u2206GL(k\u22122)\u00d7T2 \u2192GL(k\u22122) \u00d7 \u2206GL(k\u22122)\n\n(5)\n\nwhich gauge fix the GL(k) in steps, first down to GL(k \u2212 2) \u00d7 T2 where T2 are translations\nby a vector in the \u03bb plane, then to GL(k \u2212 2). In the first step, we use 2k delta functions to\ngauge fix the two k-vectors \u03c1 to\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\u03c1=\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n1\n0\n0\n..\n.\n\n0\n1\n0\n..\n.\n\n0 0\n2\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(6)\n\n\fFormally we choose\n\u2206GL(k)\u2192GL(k\u22122)\u00d7T2 =\n\nY\n\n\u03b4 2 (\u03c1\u03b1\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b1 ).\n\n(7)\n\n\u03b1\n\nHere we use \u03b1 = 1, 2 to label the spinor Lorentz indices. These equation fix all the \u03c1 variables;\nthe \u03b4 2 (\u03bba \u2212 C\u03b1a \u03c1\u03b1 ) in the integral then fixes the top two rows of C to be the \u03bb 2-plane, that\nis C\u03b1a = \u03bb\u03b1a , or\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nC=\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\u03bb\u03b1=1,1 \u03bb\u03b1=1,2\n\u03bb\u03b1=2,1 \u03bb\u03b1=2,2\nC3,1\nC3,2\n..\n..\n.\n.\nCk,1\nCk,2\n\n* * * \u03bb\u03b1=1,n\n* * * \u03bb\u03b1=2,n\n* * * C3,n\n..\n..\n.\n.\n* * * Ck,n\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(8)\n\nWith this form we can factor out the momentum and super-momentum conserving delta\nfunctions trivially, since\nk\nY\n\n\u03b4 4 (C\u03b1a \u03b7\u0303a )\u03b4 2 (C\u03b1a \u03bb\u0303a ) = \u03b4 4 (\u03bba \u03bb\u0303a )\u03b4 8 (\u03bba \u03b7\u0303a ) \u00d7\n\n\u03b1=1\n\nk\nY\n\n\u03b4 4 (C\u03b1\u0302a \u03b7\u0303a )\u03b4 2 (C\u03b1\u0302a \u03bb\u0303a )\n\n(9)\n\n\u03b1\u0302=3\n\nwhere we use the index \u03b1\u0302 to run over the (k \u2212 2) values 3, 4, * * * , k.\nHaving done this, the unfixed part of GL(k) then consists of GL(k \u2212 2) transformations,\ntogether with translations T2 of the remaining (k \u2212 2) n-vectors by any vector in the \u03bb plane.\nGeometrically, the most natural way to gauge fix T2 is to impose the 2 \u00d7 (k \u2212 2) constraints\nthat the remaining (k \u2212 2) vectors in C are orthogonal to the \u03bb plane:\nY\n\u2206GL(k\u22122)\u00d7T2 \u2192GL(k\u22122) = J\n\u03b4 2 (C\u03b1\u0302a \u03bba )\n(10)\n\u03b1\u0302\n\nHere J is some Jacobian that only depends on the \u03bb's.

However the problem is that the minors appearing in the denominator of the\nmeasure involve the full k \u00d7 n matrix C, whose first two rows are the \u03bb plane. It is natural to\ntry and find a linear transformation that maps the k \u00d7 k minors to (k \u2212 2) \u00d7 (k \u2212 2) minors.\n2\n\nNote that for general 2k > n, G(k \u2212 2, n) is not contained in G(k, n). Geometrically, the space of k-planes\nthat are forced to contain a given 2-plane is the same of the space of (k \u22122) planes living in (n\u22122) dimensions:\nG(k \u2212 2, n \u2212 2) is contained in G(k, n). The \u03b4 2 (C * \u03bb) factors in eqns. (10,11) are reducing the integral over\nG(k \u2212 2, n) to one over G(k \u2212 2, n \u2212 2), but in a moment we will find these delta functions nicely unify with\nthe remaining ones, and the resulting object is naturally integrated over G(k \u2212 2, n).\n\n3\n\n\fConsider the minor (C1 C2 * * * Ck\u22121 Ck ). We will take linear transformations of the columns of\nC, so that the first two rows of the middle 2, * * * , k \u2212 1 columns are set to zero. The simplest\nway to do this is to define new k vectors D\u03b1b as\nD\u03b1b = xb C\u03b1b\u22121 + yb C\u03b1b + zb C\u03b1b+1\n\n(12)\n\nClearly D2 , * * * , Dk\u22121 are a linear combination of C1 , * * * , Ck , therefore\n(C1 D2 * * * Dk\u22121 Ck ) = f (x, y, z)(C1 * * * Ck )\n\n(13)\n\nWe choose x, y, z so that D\u03b1b = 0. This fixes D to be of the form\nD\u03b1b = qb (hb + 1 biC\u03b1b\u22121 + hb \u2212 1 b + 1iC\u03b1b + hb b \u2212 1iC\u03b1b+1 )\n\n(14)\n\nwhere qb is any normalization factor. Here D\u03b1b = 0 due to the Schouten identity hb+1 bi\u03bbb\u22121 +\nhb \u2212 1 b + 1i\u03bbb + hb b \u2212 1i\u03bbb+1 = 0. Clearly\n(C1 D2 * * * Dk\u22121 Ck ) = h\u03bb1 \u03bbk i(D2 * * * Dk\u22121 )\n\n(15)\n\nwhere (D2 * * * Dk\u22121 ) is the (k \u2212 2) \u00d7 (k \u2212 2) minor made from the non-zero elements D\u03b1\u0302b :\n(D2 * * * Dk\u22121) = \u01eb\u03b1\u03021 ***\u03b1\u0302k\u22122 D\u03b1\u03021 2 * * * D\u03b1\u0302k\u22122 k\u22121\n\n(16)\n\nThus we have succeeded in mapping the k \u00d7 k minors to (k \u2212 2) \u00d7 (k \u2212 2) minors up to a \u03bb\ndependent factor\n(C1 * * * Ck ) = J \u2032 (D2 * * * Dk\u22121 )\n\n(17)\n\nWhat we have done is to introduce an n \u00d7 n linear transformation Qab\nD\u03b1b = C\u03b1a Qab\n\n(18)\n\nQab = qb \u00d7 (hb \u2212 1 b + 1i\u03b4ab + hb b \u2212 1i\u03b4a,b+1 + hb + 1 bi\u03b4a,b\u22121 )\n\n(19)\n\n\u03bba Qab = 0\n\n(20)\n\n\u03bb\u0303a = Qab \u03bcb , \u03b7\u0303a = Qab \u03b7b\n\n(21)\n\nwhere\n\nsatisfying\n\nNow, using Q, we can re-write\n\nexpressing \u03bb\u0303a , \u03b7\u0303a in terms of new variables \u03bcb , \u03b7b ; these forms guarantee that both momentum\nand super-momentum are conserved, since e.g. \u03bba \u03bb\u0303a = \u03bba Qab \u03bcb = 0. There is a natural choice\nfor the normalization qb so that the \u03bcb , \u03b7b have nice little-group transformation properties\n4\n\n\f1\nunder \u03bbb \u2192 tb \u03bbb , \u03bb\u0303b \u2192 t1b \u03bb\u0303b , \u03b7\u0303b \u2192 t\u22121\nb \u03b7\u0303b . Choosing qb = hb\u22121 bihb b+1i , (\u03bcb , \u03b7b ) \u2192 tb (\u03bcb , \u03b7b ) have\nexactly the same little group transformation properties as \u03bbb . Thus we choose\n\nQab =\n\nhb \u2212 1 b + 1i\u03b4ab + hb b \u2212 1i\u03b4a,b+1 + hb + 1 bi\u03b4a,b\u22121\nhb + 1 bihb b \u2212 1i\n\n(22)\n\nWith this choice for Q the relationship between the D minors and C minors becomes\n(D2 * * * Dk\u22121 ) =\n\n1\n(C1 * * * Ck )\nh12ih23i * * * hk \u2212 1 ki\n\n(23)\n\nwhere we have given the \u03bb dependent factor explicitly. Note also that with this choice\nQab = Qba\n\n(24)\n\nNow, we would clearly like to change variables from (k \u2212 2) \u00d7 n variables C\u03b1\u0302a to another\nset of (k \u2212 2) \u00d7 n variables D\u03b1\u0302b = C\u03b1\u0302a Qab . Not only are the k \u00d7 k minors of C equal (up to\n\u03bb dependent factors) to (k \u2212 2) \u00d7 (k \u2212 2) minors of D, but also the \u03b4 functions involving \u03bb\u0303\nand \u03b7\u0303 are directly functions of D, since\n\u03b4 2 (C\u03b1\u0302a \u03bb\u0303a ) = \u03b4 2 (D\u03b1\u0302b \u03bcb ), \u03b4 4 (C\u03b1\u0302a \u03b7\u0303a ) = \u03b4 4 (D\u03b1\u0302b \u03b7b )\n\n(25)\n\nBut we can't literally make this change of variables, since Qab is not invertible, given that\n\u03bba Qab = 0. Any two C\u03b1\u0302a , which differ by any translation in the \u03bb 2-plane, will yield the same\nD. However, this translational freedom T2 was precisely what we gauge-fixed by including\nQ\nthe delta function \u03b1\u0302 \u03b4 2 (C\u03b1\u0302a \u03bba ). Thus, given some fixed D\u03b1\u0302a , if there is any solution of\nD\u03b1\u0302b = C\u03b1\u0302a Qab satisfying the 2 \u00d7 (k \u2212 2) constraints C\u03b1\u0302a \u03bba = 0, this solution is unique.\nOn the other hand to be able to find any solution C\u03b1\u0302a to D\u03b1\u0302b = C\u03b1\u0302a Qab , D can not be\n\na completely general (k \u2212 2) \u00d7 n matrix, but must satisfy 2 \u00d7 (k \u2212 2) constraints. Since\nQab = Qba and so Qab \u03bbb = 0, these constraints are clearly D\u03b1\u0302b \u03bbb = C\u03b1\u0302a Qab \u03bbb = 0. We\ntherefore conclude that\nZ\nZ\nY\nY\n2\n\u2032\u2032\n(k\u22122)\u00d7n\n\u03b4 2 (D\u03b1\u0302b \u03bbb )f (D\u03b1\u0302b )\n(26)\nd(k\u22122)\u00d7n D\u03b1\u0302b\n\u03b4 (C\u03b1\u0302a \u03bba )f (C\u03b1a Qab ) = J\nd\nC\u03b1\u0302a\n\u03b1\u0302\n\n\u03b1\u0302\n\nhere J \u2032\u2032 is yet another Jacobian that only depends on the \u03bb's. We can arrive at this result\nmore formally by beginning with the LHS of eqn. (26), and multiply by 1 in the form\nZ\nY\n1 = d(k\u22122)\u00d7n D\u03b1\u0302b\n\u03b4(D\u03b1\u0302b \u2212 C\u03b1\u0302a Qab )\n(27)\n\u03b1\u0302,b\n\nWe can then perform the integrals over C. The \u03b4 2 (C *\u03bb) factors together with all but 2\u00d7(k\u22122)\nof the delta functions introduced in eqn (27) allow us to uniquely solve for all the C's, leaving\n5\n\n\fus with a remaining 2 \u00d7 (k \u2212 2) \u03b4 functions linear in the D's, which we know must impose\n2 \u00d7 (k \u2212 2) constraints D * \u03bb = 0. This yields the RHS of eqn. (26) up to a \u03bb dependent\nJacobian factor J \u2032 .\nWe are now done: using eqns.

Note that after\nGL(k \u2212 2) gauge fixing and using the 4k bosonic delta functions, we are left with an integral\nover (k \u2212 2)(n \u2212 k \u2212 2) variables, which is of course precisely the same as the momentumspace integrals studied in [1]. The residues studied in [1] are also trivially related to those\n6\n\n\fof eqn. (34): setting the minor (Ci Ci+1 . . . Ci+k\u22121 ) to zero in [1] corresponds to setting the\nminor (Di+1 Di+2 * * * Di+k\u22122 ) to zero in eqn. (34). Therefore, all the results obtained in [1],\nidentifying the various contours associated with tree amplitudes as well as 1- and 2-loop\nleading singularities, are trivially translated to the corresponding contours for Rn;k as well.\nIt is remarkable that the original formula eqn. (1) in the usual twistor space is almost\nidentical in form to eqn. (33) in the dual momentum-twistor space, differing only by factoring\nout the MHV superamplitude and shifting k \u2192 k \u22122. This similarity implies an infinite chain\nof interesting dualities: we can take the momentum-twistor formula in G(k \u2212 2, n) and go to\nits dual space, factoring out the MHV superamplitude to get an expression in G(k \u2212 4, n). In\nthis way we can relate an amplitude with some given k to one with k \u2192 k \u2212 2 \u2192 k \u2212 4 * * * .\nThis shows that in some sense, amplitudes with even (odd) k can be related to MHV (NMHV)\namplitudes in some dual space. Furthermore, due to parity we can also send k \u2192 n\u2212k at any\nstage in this process and increase k as well, yielding an infinite number of dual descriptions.\nWe have seen that the G(k, n) integral of eqn. (1) simultaneously manifests the superconformal and dual superconformal symmetries, as well as cyclic and parity invariance. It\nis amusing that different \"gauge-fixings\" of the GL(k) symmetry are convenient for seeing\ndifferent symmetries: the gauge-fixing introduced in [1] is more convenient for manifesting\nparity, while the one exploited in this paper is better suited to manifesting dual superconformal invariance. Since the full Yangian algebra of N = 4 SYM scattering amplitudes [8] arises\nfrom taking commutators of superconformal and dual superconformal generators, we expect\nthat the object in eqn. (1) is invariant under the full Yangian as well. Indeed, as mentioned in\n[1], perhaps eqn. (1) should be thought of as a generating function for all Yangian invariants,\nwith residue theorems simply encoding all the remarkable relations between these invariants.\nIt would be interesting to establish the Yangian invariance of eqn. (1) even more directly.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Fernando Alday, Jacob Bourjaily, Jared Kaplan, Juan Maldacena, Edward Witten\nand especially Andrew Hodges, Lionel Mason and David Skinner for stimulating discussions.\nN.A.-H. is supported by the DOE under grant DE-FG02-91ER40654, F.C. was supported in\npart by the NSERC of Canada and MEDT of Ontario.\n\nReferences\n[1] N.
