We show that for general spherically symmetric configurations, contributions of\nbroad class of gravitational and mixed gauge-gravitational Chern-Simons terms to the equations\nof motion vanish identically in D > 3 dimensions. This implies that such terms in the action\ndo not affect Birkhoff's theorem or any previously known spherically symmetric solutions. Furthermore, we investigate the thermodynamical properties using the procedure described in an\naccompanying paper. We find that in D > 3 static spherically symmetric case Chern-Simons\nterms do not contribute to the entropy either. Moreover, if one requires only for the metric\ntensor to be spherically symmetric, letting other fields unrestricted, the results extend almost\ncompletely, with only one possible exception - Chern-Simons Lagrangian terms in which the\ngravitational part is just the n = 2 irreducible gravitational Chern-Simons term.\n\nKeywords: Black hole entropy, gravitational Chern-Simons terms\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn a companion paper, [1], referred to as I, we have started the study of gravitational ChernSimons terms in higher dimensions. The motivation comes from the observation that, while the\n2+1 dimensional case can count on a considerable number of analyses [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], little\nis known about higher dimensional gravitational Chern-Simons theories (we will specify shortly\nwhat we mean with this terminology). In I we started searching for systematic answers to the\nquestions raised by the presence of these terms in higher dimensions. One of the problems they\nraise is how their addition modifies black hole solutions and associated charges. Another important problem is how to compute the black hole entropy in their presence. In this paper, relying\nin particular on the results of I, we address these issues for spherically symmetric configurations.\nLet us briefly review the above mentioned problems by introducing a few definitions and\nbasic properties. We wish to investigate the properties of gravitational actions extended with\nChern-Simons terms,\nL = Lcov + LCS\n\n(1)\n\nBy Lcov we denote some generic manifestly diffeomorphism covariant gravitational Lagrangian\nD-form in D dimensions, while LCS contain Chern-Simons terms, which are, on the contrary,\nnot manifestly covariant.\nA general gravitational Chern-Simons (CS) term, in D = 2n \u2212 1 dimensions, has the form\n\u03a5n (\u0393) = n\n\n1\n\nZ\n\n0\n\ndt Pn (\u0393, Rt , . . . , Rt )\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Rt = td\u0393 + t2 \u0393\u0393, \u0393 is the Levi\u2013Civita connection and Pn denotes an invariant symmetric\npolynomial of the appropriate Lie algebra, which, for purely gravitational CS terms, is the Lie\nalgebra of the SO(1, D \u2212 1) group (in this case Pn are symmetrized traces). In general the\npolynomial Pn may be irreducible or reducible. It is important to recall that for n = 2k \u2212 1,\nthat is, in D = 4k \u2212 3 dimensions, irreducible invariant symmetric polynomial of the Lie algebra\nof SO(1, D \u2212 1) identically vanish, P2k\u22121 = 0. So, purely gravitational irreducible CS terms\ncan appear only in D = 4k \u2212 1 dimensions. In this paper we will consider both reducible and\nirreducible Pn 's.\u2217\nWe will also consider action terms where a gravitational CS term is multiplied by an invariant\npolynomial made of one or more gauge field strengths, so as to fill up a D-form. The simplest\nof such reducible action terms have the form\nL1,mix = \u03a5m (\u0393)Pk (F)\n\nor\n\nL2,mix = \u03a5k (A)Pm (R)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere F represents the generic curvature of a gauge connection A and Pk is an invariant polynomial of order k, such that D = 2m + 2k \u2212 1. A can be either a non-Abelian or an Abelian\ngauge connection, or even an RR field (in the latter case the relation between form orders and\nspacetime dimension may be different from the just mentioned one). We will refer to terms like\n(3) as mixed Lagrangian terms.\nTo summarize and state our problem with precision, in this paper we will consider a broad\nclass of CS terms\nLCS =\n\nX\n\n(i)\n\nLgCS +\n\ni\n\n\u2217\n\nX\nj\n\nOur notation is mainly as in [10].\n\n2\n\n(j)\n\nLaCS\n\n(4)\n\n\fwhere\nLgCS = \u03a5ni1 (\u0393) Pni2 (R) Pni3 (R) * * * Pri1 (F1 ) Pri2 (F2 ) * * *\n\n(i)\n\n(5)\n\nLaCS = \u03a5mj (Aj ) Pnj1 (R) Pnj2 (R) * * * Prj1 (F1 ) Prj2 (F2 ) * * *\n\n(j)\n\n(6)\n\nand \u0393 is the symmetric Levi-Civita connection. It is assumed in (6) that there is at least one\nPn (R) term present. Also, it is understood in (5) and (6) that indices n are even integers,\notherwise, as explained before, the terms vanish identically (up to total derivatives). Terms\npresent in (4), which are of gravitational and mixed gauge-gravitational type, for brevity we\nshall sometimes call gravitational CS Lagrangian terms.\nFor completeness, we note that purely gauge Chern-Simons Lagrangian terms, which are\ngenerally of the form\n(j)\n\nLCS = \u03a5mj (Aj ) Prj1 (F1 ) Prj2 (F2 ) * * * ,\n\n(7)\n\ndue to manifest diff-covariance are, if present, contained in the Lcov part of Lagrangian (1). The\nCS terms (6) too are manifestly diff-covariant, but due to their common origin with (5) it is\nuseful to treat them jointly.\nIn I we have analyzed the consequences of adding gravitational or mixed CS terms in gravity\ntheory, as far as black hole entropy is concerned. Extending the covariant phase space formalism\nof [11], according to [12], we have computed in detail the CS induced modifications to Wald\nentropy formula. We have analyzed the covariance of the ensuing entropy formula and concluded\nthat, although it looks superficially non-covariant, it can be cast in a covariant form.\nIn the present paper we continue the analysis of the consequences of adding CS terms (4)(6) to gravitational actions, by considering the specific case of spherically symmetric metrics.\nWe will show that solutions with spherically symmetric metric are generally not modified in\nD > 3 dimensions, with the only possible exceptions when the following two conditions are\nsimultaneously present: (i) a gravitational CS Lagrangian term, which is a wedge-product of\nthe irreducible gravitational n = 2 CS term and a purely gauge factor, is present, (ii) this gauge\nfactor (which is by definition gauge invariant) is not spherically symmetric for the solution in\nquestion. If both conditions are fulfilled then this \"exceptional\" gravitational CS Lagrangian\nterm may possibly modify such solution of Lcov .\nMoreover, relying on the results of I, we will show that the black hole entropy is not modified\neither, with the same exception understood.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we write down the contributions to the equations\nof motion of CS Lagrangian terms present in (4). In Sec. 3 we analyze these contributions in\nthe case of spherically symmetric metric, where the central results are stated in Theorems 1\nand 2. In Sec. 4 we analyze contributions to black hole entropy, the main result being stated in\nTheorem 3. In Sec. 5 we summarize our findings. In Appendices some technical aspects of the\ncalculations are presented in more detail.\n\n2\n\nEquations of motion\n\nAdding gravitational CS terms in the Lagrangian brings about additional terms in the equations\nof motion. It was shown in [13] that the equation for the metric tensor g\u03b1\u03b2 acquires an additional\nterm C \u03b1\u03b2 of the form\nC \u03b1\u03b2 = \u2207\u03c1 S (\u03b1\u03b2)\u03c1\n(8)\n3\n\n\fwhere tensor the S (\u03b1\u03b2)\u03c1 , whose exact form depends on the explicit form of the CS Lagrangian\nterms, is antisymmetric in the last two indices. Moreover the tensor C \u03b1\u03b2 is traceless and\ncovariantly conserved\nC \u03b1\u03b1 = 0 ,\n\n\u2207\u03b1 C \u03b1\u03b2 = \u2207\u03b1 \u2207\u03c1 S (\u03b1\u03b2)\u03c1 = 0\n\n(9)\n\nand S satisfies the following properties\nS \u03b1\u03b2\u03c1 = S \u03b1[\u03b2\u03c1] ,\n\nS \u03b1\u03b2\u03b1 = 0 ,\n\n\u2207\u03b1 S \u03b1\u03b2\u03c1 = 0\n\n(10)\n\nThese follow from the symmetries of the Riemann tensor, Bianchi identities and the form of S.\nIt was also shown in [13] that the tensor C \u03b1\u03b2 can be viewed as a generalization of the Cotton\ntensor.\nMixed CS Lagrangian terms contribute also to equations of motion for gauge fields participating in these terms. What follows is an overview of contributions to the equation of motion\nof different types of gravitational CS terms.\nWe consider a mixed Lagrangian with one gravitational CS term, N \u2212 1 gravitational terms\nand S gauge terms,\nL = \u03a5n1 (\u0393) Pn2 (R) * * * PnN (R) Pr1 (F1 ) * * * PrS (FS )\n\n(11)\n\nwhere each gauge field strength Fi is a pi -form. Using partial integration and discarding boundary terms, the variation of this Lagrangian can be put in the following form\n\u03b4L =\n+\n\nN\nX\n\ni=1\nS\nX\n\nPn1 (R) * * * \u03b4\u03a5ni (\u0393) * * * PnN (R) Pr1 (F1 ) * * * PrS (FS ) +\n\n(12)\n\n(\u22121)1+\u03b3j Pn1 (R) * * * PnN (R) Pr1 (F1 ) * * * \u03b4\u03a5rj (Aj ) * * * PrS (FS )\n\nj=1\n\nHere Pn1 (R) * * * \u03b4\u03a5ni (\u0393) * * * PnN (R) denotes the wedge product Pn1 (R) * * * PnN (R) in which\nPni (R) is replaced by \u03b4\u03a5ni (\u0393). The order of the form Pr1 (F1 ) * * * Prj\u22121 (Fj\u22121 ) is denoted by \u03b3j\nPj\u22121\nand is equal to \u03b3j = l=1\npl rl .\nThe first line of (12) determines the equation of motion (8) for the metric and the second\nline the equations of motion for the gauge fields.

The only non-vanishing components of the Riemann tensor for a spherically symmetric metric in coordinates (24) are, up to symmetries of their indices, of the form R\u03bc\u03bd\u03bc\u03bd and\nR0i1i . Since the metric is diagonal, this remains valid even if some of the indices are raised.\nFrom this property immediately it follows that\nR3 = 0\n\ntr(R2 ) = 0\n\n(27)\n\nThe proof is by direct calculation of the Riemann tensor components, and is presented in Appendix B. Using Lemma 1 we can look at the product of Riemann tensors inside the tensor C \u03bc\u03bd .\nA consequence is the following theorem:\nTheorem 1. The contribution of the gravitational and mixed gauge-gravitational ChernSimons Lagrangian terms (4)-(6) to the equations of motion vanishes identically for any configuration with spherically symmetric metric in D > 3 dimensions, unless the gravitational\ncontribution is the sole \u03a52 (\u0393) factor wedge-multiplied by the spherically asymmetric gauge factor (we refer to such terms in Lagrangian as exceptional terms).\nProof : First notice that in all cases, except in those in which \u03a52 (\u0393) is present as the only\ngravitational factor, all contributions to the equations of motion of the CS terms contain as a\nfactor either R3 or tr(R2 ), which, by Lemma 1, vanish for spherically symmetric metrics (23). In\nD > 3 this leaves only the following gravitational CS Lagrangian terms as potentially nontrivial\n\u03a52 (\u0393) Pr1 (F1 ) * * * PrS (FS ) ,\n6\n\n(28)\n\n\fwhere Fi are some pi -form gauge field strengths. The total contribution of such terms to the\nLagrangian is obviously of the form\n\u03a52 (\u0393) G(F) ,\n\n(29)\n\nwhere G(F) is a gauge invariant (D \u2212 3)-form. From (12) it follows that (29) contributes only\nto the equation of motion for the metric gab (due to the str(R2 ) = 0 factor appearing in the\nequations for gauge fields). The tensor S \u03b1\u03b2\u03c1 is\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nS \u03b1\u03b2\u03c1 = (\u2212)s+1 \u2217 2K\u0304\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2\n(2) G(F)\n= (\u2212)s+1\n\n2 * 3 \u03bc1 ***\u03bcD\u22121 \u03b2 \u03c1\u03b1\n\u01eb\nR \u03bc1 \u03bc2 G(F)\u03bc3 ***\u03bcD\u22121 ,\nD!\n\n(30)\n\nwhich follows from (18). Following the statement in Theorem 1, we now restrict ourselves to\nconfigurations of gauge fields for which G(F) is spherically symmetric. Spherically symmetric\nforms correspond to one, or to the linear combination of two, of the following cases:\n(a) a(t, r) dt + b(t, r) dr\n(b) a(t, r) dt \u2227 dr\n(c) a\u2032 (t, r) \u01eb\u0303D\u22122\n\n(1-form)\n\n(2-form)\n((D \u2212 2)-form)\n\n(d) a\u2032 (t, r) dt \u2227 \u01eb\u0303D\u22122 + b\u2032 (t, r) dr \u2227 \u01eb\u0303D\u22122\n(e) a\u2032 (t, r) dt \u2227 dr \u2227 \u01eb\u0303D\u22122\n\n((D \u2212 1)-form)\n\n(D-form)\n\nwhere \u01eb\u0303D\u22122 is the volume form of S D\u22122 sphere. Since G(F) is (D \u2212 3)-form, the possibilities (c)(e) are trivially excluded. Thus we are left with the first two, mutually excluding, possibilities\n(a) and (b). For (a), which exists only in D = 4 dimensions, and where G is a derivative of some\nscalar field, it was shown in the literature [15] that the spherical symmetry of the metric forces\nC \u03b1\u03b2 = 0, i.e., there is no contribution to the equations of motion.\u00a7 For (b), which exists only\nin D = 5 dimensions, by using G(F) \u221d dt \u2227 dr and expressions for components of the Riemann\ntensor (47), we obtain that the only nonvanishing components of the S \u03b1\u03b2\u03c1 tensor have the form\nS ijk \u221d \u01ebijk01 . We see that S \u03b1\u03b2\u03c1 is antisymmetric in the first two indices, so S (\u03b1\u03b2)\u03c1 = 0, which by\n(8) gives C \u03b1\u03b2 = 0. Thus we have obtained that terms of the type (28) will not contribute either\nto the equations of motion if, in addition to the metric tensor, the total gauge factor G(F) is\nspherically symmetric. This completes the proof of Theorem 1.\nTheorem 1 extends the recent result from [17] and states that addition of any combination\nof gravitational and mixed gauge-gravitational Chern-Simons terms (4)-(6) to any Lagrangian\nleaves all spherically symmetric solutions unchanged in D > 3 dimensions.\u00b6 It also shows that\nthis is still valid in much broader circumstances. Even if we require only for the metric to be\nspherically symmetric, and allow other fields to be spherically asymmetric, Theorem 1 states\nthat solutions can be affected only if two conditions are met: (i) CS terms of the type (29) are\n\u00a7\n\nResults from [16] suggest that this may not be valid in Einstein-Cartan first-order approach to gravity.\nHowever, in this paper we stick to standard general relativistic formulation of gravity with torsionless connection.\n\u00b6\nBy spherically symmetric configurations we mean configurations in which metric and gauge-invariant tensors,\nsuch as G(F), are spherical symmetry invariants.\n\n7\n\n\fadded to Lagrangian, (ii) the total gauge part (of such terms collected together) G(F) evaluated\non the solution is not a spherically symmetric (D \u2212 3)-form. We postpone further discussion on\nthese \"exceptional\" cases to Sec. 5.\nFor completeness, we mention that purely gauge CS Lagrangian terms (7) cannot be included\nin the general statement of Theorem 1. It was shown in the literature on some explicit examples\nthat such CS Lagrangian terms can affect spherically symmetric solutions [18, 19, 20]. However,\nwe remind the reader that purely gauge CS terms are manifestly diff-covariant and so do not\nfall in the class of CS terms we are interested in this paper.\nAlthough the D = 3 case is not meant to be explicitly addressed in this paper, let us\nsummarize what can be said about it on the basis of the existing literature. In D = 3 dimensions\nTheorem 1 is in general not valid. Here one has the n = 2 irreducible gravitational Chern-Simons\nterm with contribution to equations of motion proportional to the Cotton-York tensor,\nC\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\n=\u01eb\n\n\u03bc\u03b1\u03b2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2207\u03b1 R\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u03b2\n\n1\n\u2212 \u03b4 \u03bd\u03b2 R\n4\n\n\u0013\n\n(31)\n\nwhich does not vanish for a general spherically symmetric metric (23). For example, it was\nshown in [21] that already for a static spherically symmetric metric\nds2 = \u2212f (r)dt2 +\n\ndr 2\n+ r 2 d\u03c62\nf (r)\n\n(32)\n\none obtains\nf \u2032\u2032\u2032\nC t\u03c6 = \u221a ,\n4 f\n\n(33)\n\nwhich is generally non-vanishing.\nHowever, it is known that the Cotton tensor vanishes for several important classes of 3D\nmetrics, so in these cases the 3D gravitational CS Lagrangian term is effectively irrelevant as\nfar as the equations of motion are concerned. For example, the Cotton tensor vanishes for any\n3D Einstein metrick . In particular, the Cotton tensor vanishes for the famous BTZ black hole\nsolution [22]. The generalized Cotton tensor is still conformally invariant [13], but the Einstein\nmetrics in D > 3 are not necessary maximally symmetric.\nBirkhoff's theorem in the presence of gravitational CS term in D = 3 was examined by\nCavagli\u00e0 [23], and in particular class of D = 4 theories with mixed-type gravitational CS Lagrangian term in [24]. Using our Theorem 1 we generalize these results to a wide range of higher\ndimensional cases:\nTheorem 2. (Chern-Simons-Birkhoff) Assuming that we have a theory in D > 3 dimensional\nspacetime (described by the Lagrangian LG ) in which all spherically symmetric solutions are\nnecessarily static, this property remains valid even if we include additional gravitational (pure\nor mixed) Chern-Simons Lagrangian terms LCS (4)-(6).\nk\n\ngab is an Einstein metric if the Ricci tensor is proportional to the metric itself, Rab = kgab for some constant\nk. It is true in any dimension D \u2265 3 that gab is an Einstein metric if and only if it is a solution to the vacuum\nEinstein field equations with cosmological constant \u039b = (D \u2212 2)k/2.\n\n8\n\n\fFor example, Birkhoff's theorem is known to be valid for the Lovelock\u2013type gravitational\nLagrangians in any dimension (see [25, 26]). Some other examples can be found in [27].\n\n4\n\nEntropy of static spherically symmetric black holes\n\nIn the previous section we have shown that, generically, gravitational CS Lagrangian terms do\nnot affect spherically symmetric solutions in D > 3. Here we will show that they do not affect\nthe entropy of static spherically symmetric black holes. By applying staticity to (23) one obtains\nthat any static spherically symmetric metric can be written in the form\nds2 = \u2212f (r)dt2 +\n\ndr 2\n+ h(r)d\u03a92D\u22122\ng(r)\n\n(34)\n\nwhich can be used for static spherically symmetric black holes outside the horizon.\nIn the theories we consider the Lagrangian (1) can be written in the following forms\nL = Lcov + LCS = Lcov + LaCS + LgCS = Ldiff\u2212cov + LgCS\n\n(35)\n\nwhere the part Ldiff\u2212cov contains all manifestly diff-covariant terms (which includes also LaCS\npart), while the second piece contains all non-manifestly diff-covariant terms. In the class of\ntheories we consider in this paper, LgCS is made of terms as in (5). In such theories the entropy\nassigned to the black hole solutions can correspondingly be split in several ways\nSbh = Scov + SCS = Scov + SaCS + SgCS = Sdiff\u2212cov + SgCS\n\n(36)\n\nThe piece Sdiff\u2212cov can be obtained from Ldiff\u2212cov , and is given by the general Wald formula\n[28, 29, 11]\nSdiff\u2212cov = SW = 2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u01eb\nB\n\na\n\n\u03b4Ldiff\u2212cov\n\u03b4Rab\u03bc\u03bd\n\nb\n\n!\n\n(37)\n\u03bc\u03bd\u03c11 ***\u03c1D\u22122\n\nThe second piece in (36), SgCS , can be obtained from LCS by the generalization of Wald's\nprocedure to non-manifestly diff-covariant Lagrangians, as described in [12]. In [1] it was shown\nthat for the gravitational CS Lagrangian terms (5) there is a general expression also for this\npart of the entropy\nSgCS = 2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nB\n\n\u01ebab\n\n\u03b4LgCS\n\u03b4Rtab\u03bc\u03bd\n\n!\n\n(38)\n\u03bc\u03bd\u03c11 ***\u03c1D\u22122\n\nwhich is similar in form to Wald formula (37), the only difference being that one takes the\nvariation with respect to Rt instead of R.\u2217\u2217\nIn both terms (37) and (38) one inserts the black hole solution to the equations of motion\nobtained from the complete Lagrangian (35), and integrates over the (D \u2212 2)-dimensional horizon cross-section (bifurcation surface) with binormal \u01ebab , normalized by \u01ebab \u01ebab = \u22122.\n\u2217\u2217\n\nHere it is understood that the variation with respect to Rt acts inside the t integral present in the Lagrangian.\n(i)\nThe Lagrangians used here are of the form LgCS from (4), which means that there will always be exactly one \u03a5\nfactor, and consequently exactly one t integral.\n\n9\n\n\fTheorem 3. Gravitational CS Lagrangian terms (4)-(6) do not affect the entropy of static\nspherically symmetric black holes\u2020\u2020 in D > 3 dimensions, apart from the exceptional cases mentioned in Theorem 1 (which have spherically asymmetric gauge field configurations).\nProof : First we note that Theorem 1 guarantees (up to the exceptional cases mentioned\nbelow) that gravitational CS Lagrangian terms (4)-(6) do not change static spherically symmetric\nblack hole solutions (obtained from L = Lcov ), which means that they do not change the Scov\npart of the black hole entropy. The only possible exceptions are the cases excluded in Theorem 1:\nCS Lagrangian terms having n = 2 gravitational CS term as the sole gravitational contribution in\nthe case of configurations in which the gauge part of such CS Lagrangian term is not spherically\nsymmetric. When such terms change a solution, then they obviously may change Scov .\u2021\u2021\nLet us turn now to the SCS = SgCS +SaCS contribution. Inspection of the relevant Lagrangian\nterms (5) and (6), together with the corresponding entropy formulae (38) and (37), shows that\nproperties (27) imply that all terms give vanishing contribution to the entropy, except those\nwhich have just one gravitational factor with n = 2. These terms have one of the two following\nforms\n\u03a52 (\u0393) str(Fr11 ) * * * str(FrSS )\n\n\u03a5m (A) str(Fr11 ) * * *\n\nstr(FrSS ) str(R2 )\n\n(39)\n(40)\n\nThe Lagrangian term (39) produces a contribution to the entropy formula proportional to [1]\nZ\n\nB\n\n\u0393N str(Fr11 ) * * * str(FrSS )\n\n(41)\n\nwhere (\u0393N )\u03bc = 12 \u01eb\u03b1 \u03b2 \u0393\u03b2 \u03b1\u03bc , while the Lagrangian term (40) produces a contribution to the\nentropy formula proportional to\nZ\n\nB\n\n\u03a5m (A) str(Fr11 ) * * * str(FrSS ) RN\n\n(42)\n\nwhere (RN )\u03bc\u03bd = 12 \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2 R\u03b2\u03b1\u03bc\u03bd . From the fact that in the metric (34) the components of the\nbinormal \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2 lie in (t, r)-plane, and from the explicit form of the connection and the Riemann\ntensor given in (49) and (50), it follows that\n(\u0393N )i = 0 ,\n\n(RN )ij = 0\n\n(43)\n\nThis entails that the contributions (41) and (42) to the black hole entropy also vanish. This\ncompletes the proof of Theorem 3.\u00a7\u00a7\nAs a simple example, we apply our results to the special case of CS modified gravity in D = 4\nwith the Lagrangian density\nL = R\u01eb + L\u03b8 + \u03bb\u03a52 (\u0393) \u2227 d\u03b8\n\u2020\u2020\n\n(44)\n\nStatic spherically symmetric black holes are defined here as being characterized by a static and spherically\nsymmetric metric tensor(34), with no conditions on the other fields.\n\u2021\u2021\nHowever, as discussed in Sec. 5, in such exceptional cases spherical symmetry of the metric will be ruined.\n\u00a7\u00a7\nNote that purely gauge CS terms (7), which we included into Ldiff\u2212cov , do not produce additional terms in\nSdiff\u2212cov . However, as they contribute to the equation of motion they may change the entropy by affecting the\nblack hole solution.\n\n10\n\n\fwhere \u03b8(x) is scalar field, and \u03bb is the coupling constant (which does not appear in L\u03b8 ). As the\nCS Lagrangian term in these theories can be written in manifestly diff-covariant form LCS =\n\u03b8 R \u2227 R, where \u03b8(x) is some scalar field, they do not belong to the type of theories characterized\nby Lagrangians which cannot be written in manifestly diff-covariant form, which are of our\nprimary interest. However, our results extend also to these theories and it is interesting to\ncompare them with those existing in the literature on these specific D = 4 theories.\nThe theory (44) is rather well-studied\u00b6\u00b6 so we use it to compare our results with the existing\nliterature. Let g0\u03bc\u03bd and \u03b80 (r, t) be some arbitrary spherically symmetric solution of the theory\nwith \u03bb = 0. Then Theorem 1 says that it will be a solution for all values of \u03bb, in agreement\nwith the known results [15]. Theorem 2 says that, if L\u03b8 is such that in the theory with \u03bb = 0\nBirkhoff's theorem holds, then it holds for all \u03bb's. This extends [24] where such result was\nshown in case when L\u03b8 is such that the \u03bb = 0 theory posesses a Schwarzschild black hole as\nsolution. Finally, Theorem 3 says that if this solution describes a black hole, then its entropy\ndoes not depend on \u03bb. In [30] it was shown, using Euclidean methods, that the thermodynamics\nof such spherically symmetric black holes will not depend on \u03bb modulo possible contribution\nof some boundary term \u2206F in the on-shell action which the authors were unable to calculate.\nOur results show that this unknown boundary term does not influence the entropy of spherically\nsymmetric black holes in theories (44).\n\n5\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper we have analyzed the consequences of adding a broad class of Chern-Simons terms\nto a gravitational action in the case of spherical symmetry. We have considered both gravitational and mixed gauge-gravity CS terms and focused on the case of a general spherically\nsymmetric metric. We have found that in D > 3 dimensions (the case of the gravitational CS\nterm in 3D must be considered separately and, generally, has already been studied in the literature) the contribution of such terms to the equations of motion vanishes identically, except in the\ncase when the following two conditions are met: (i) a mixed gauge-gravitational CS Lagrangian\nterm, which is a wedge-product of the irreducible gravitational n = 2 CS term and a purely gauge\nfactor, is present, (ii) this gauge factor (which is by definition gauge invariant) is not spherically\nsymmetric for the configuration in question. A consequence is that the gravitational and mixed\ngauge-gravitational CS Lagrangian terms, apart from the previously mentioned exceptions, do\nnot affect Birkhoff's theorem or any solution with spherically symmetric metric.\nWe have then considered the problem of computing the entropy for spherically symmetric\nblack holes in the presence of such CS terms. To this end we have used a general formula obtained\nin a previous paper, [1], by means of the covariant phase space formalism, adapted to the\npresence of CS terms. This formula is similar to the one obtained by Wald for covariant gravity\nLagrangians. Applied to spherically symmetric black holes it tells us that the contribution of\nthe CS terms to the entropy is null.\nLet us briefly analyze the \"exceptional cases\" in more detail. By Theorem 1, they may appear\nonly for configurations in which the total gauge part of exceptional CS Lagrangian terms is not\nspherically symmetric. It is important to note that this form is by definition gauge invariant,\nwhich means that such exceptional configurations must contain some gauge fields which are\nnot spherically symmetric. Let us now assume that one such configuration is a solution to\n\u00b6\u00b6\n\nMostly in cases L\u03b8 = 0 (in which case \u03b8(x) is non-dynamical field) and L\u03b8 = (\u2202\u03b8)2 . See [9] for a review.\n\n11\n\n\fequations of motion obtained from some Lagrangian Lcov . Then spherical symmetry of the\nmetric requires that the energy-momentum tensor (obtained from Lcov ) be spherically symmetric\nfor such solution. One can now see that \"exceptional\" solutions are somewhat exotic, possessing\nspherical asymmetry in the gauge fields which disappears in the energy-momentum tensor, but\nsurvives in the gauge invariant factor present in the \"exceptional\" CS Lagrangian term we want\nto add to Lcov . We are not aware of any explicit examples of such behavior, but we are not aware\neither of a proof that such cases are not possible in complicated theories with several gauge fields.\nSo, let us now assume that there are such \"exceptional\" solutions, and see what we should expect\nwhen we add to the Lagrangian some gravitational and mixed gauge-gravitational CS part LCS\nwhich includes \"exceptional\" CS terms. This will produce contribution to the equations of\nmotion for the metric, which, for \"exceptional\" terms, is proportional to (in symbolic notation)\n\u2207(RG(F)). As G(F) is for the unperturbed solution not spherically symmetric, we see that\nin general we should expect a spherically asymmetric perturbation of the metric equation. So,\nit appears that in general in \"exceptional cases\" one should expect that addition of CS terms\ncompletely breaks the spherical symmetry, even for the metric tensor.\nOf course in this paper the hypothesis of spherical symmetry of the metric plays a crucial\nrole, and it is of utmost interest to understand in a systematic way when and how relaxing\nof this hypothesis will change the null results (in the case of irreducible gravitational CS term\nin 7-dimensions some specific examples are given in [17]). This is in fact what we intend to\ninvestigate next.\n\nAcknowledgements\nOne of us (L.B.) would like to thank the Theoretical Physics Department, Univ. of Zagreb,\nfor hospitality and financial support during his visits there.
