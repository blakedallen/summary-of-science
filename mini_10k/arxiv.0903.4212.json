Introduction\nThe study of the circumstellar environment in young stellar\nobjects (YSOs) is one of the most interesting topics in star\nformation and can give clues about the birth of planetary\nsystems. Polarimetry is a powerful tool to detect asymmetries in YSOs. This is specially important for non-resolved\nobjects where the technique gives a direct diagnostic. The\nscattered emission produced by gas or dust in outflows, jets\nand/or disks produces polarization that can give us information about the physical properties of these environments.\nIn general, polarimetric observations in YSOs show temporal variability usually with the polarization position angle (PA) confined to a narrow interval that allows to infer\nthe presence of a disk (Bastien 1996). Early studies in YSOs\ncomparing the PA of the linear polarization and the direction of the jets indicated that they are preferentially perpendicular (Mundt & Fried 1983). Single scattering in an\noptically thin disk (Brown & McLean 1977) results in a PA\nperpendicular to the direction of the major axis of the disk\nprojected in the plane of the sky (hereinafter, the disk PA).\nSend offprint requests to: A. Pereyra, e-mail: pereyra@on.br\n?\nBased on observations obtained at the Observat\u00f3rio do Pico\ndos Dias, LNA/MCT, Itajub\u00e1, Brazil.\n\nOn the other hand, optically thick disks may show multiple\nscattering with the PA parallel to the disk PA (Angel 1969;\nBastien & M\u00e9nard 1990). In general, the effect of different\ndisk inclinations alters the polarization level but maintains\nthe PA unchanged in both scenarios. For pole-on objects,\nno net polarization is observed and there is no sense in\ndefining a PA for these systems.\nAlternative models (Whitney & Hartmann 1992, 1993)\nalso can obtain polarization PA perpendicular to the disk\nPA in geometrically thin but optically thick disks. These\nmodels can also generate polarization PA parallel\nto the disk PA if there is scattering by material\nabove and below the equatorial disk. In these cases,\nthe optically thick disk requires an additional envelope with\nbipolar cavities cleared by an outflow from the YSOs.\nThe statistics from M\u00e9nard & Bastien (1992) is compatible with the prevalent presence of optically thick circumstellar disks surrounding YSOs. Their sample included\nmainly T Tauri stars (TTS) but also some Herbig Ae/Be\nstars (HeAeBeS). Maheswar et al. (2002) compiled a sample of HeAeBeS with outflows direction well defined along\nwith polarization measurements and concluded that 55% of\nthem are consistent with optically thick disks. This seems to\nindicate that disks in YSOs are usually optically thick. This\n\n\f2\n\nPereyra et al.: Near Infrared polarimetry of a sample of YSOs\n\nis also supported by Bastien (1996) who concluded that the\npolarization observations in YSOs can be explained by multiple scattering by dust grains in a flattened circumstellar\ndisk probably embedded in larger, approximately spherical\nenvelope.\nPolarimetry in the near infrared (NIR) is less affected\nby foreground polarization, something that can be critical\nin optical bands. Correlations between the NIR polarization PA and any existing asymmetry (like outflows, jets or\ndisks) allow thus a better evaluation of the optical depth\nof the scattering mechanism. Compared with the optical,\nthe statistics for NIR polarization measurements of YSOs\nneeds to be improved (Hough et al. 1981; Moneti et al. 1984;\nTamura & Sato 1989; McGregor et al. 1994; Whitney et\nal. 1997; Perrin et al. 2004; Beckford et al. 2008; Kusakabe\net al. 2008). Therefore, a larger NIR sample will help to\nclarify if the trend of optically thick disks in optical wavelengths is also valid in the NIR domain. In addition, the\ncomparison between the optical and NIR polarization PA\ncan give clues about the detection of a possible polarization PA reversal in YSOs (Hough et al. 1981), caused by\nthe transition from an optically thick disk in the optical to\nan optically thin environment in the NIR.\nAsymmetries in YSOs can also be explored using radio,\nmm/submm data, or NIR interferometry. For example, the\ndisk PA can be evaluated using CO emission (Korner &\nSargent 1995) or thermal continuum emission from dust\n(Kitamura et al. 2002; Qi et al. 2003). NIR interferometry\nis also useful to detect the disk PA in YSOs (Akeson et\nal. 2005; Malbet et al. 2007). On the other hand, the PA\nof outflows or jets can be obtained from radio extended\nemission (Anglada 1996). In addition, long-slit spectroscopy\nin forbidden emission lines has also been used to obtain the\njet axis in YSOs (Hirth et al. 1994, 1997; Lavalley et al.\n1997; Mund & Eisl\u00f6ffel 1998).\nIn this work, we combine the detection of asymmetries\nin YSOs through NIR polarization with the determination\nof the disk PA from other techniques to constrain the optical properties of the circumstellar disks. Our sample includes selected TTS and HeAeBeS. The observations and\ndata reduction are presented in \u00a7 2. The results, including the foreground and intrinsic polarization computation,\nare presented in \u00a7 3. The discussion about the correlations\nwith the jet/disk PA and the comparison between optical\nand NIR polarization PA are shown in \u00a7 4. This section\nalso includes correlations between the disk optical depth\nand the IRAS colours and the spectral index. Comments\non individual objects are presented in \u00a7 5. The conclusions\nare drawn in \u00a7 6.\n\n2. Observations\nThe observations were made using IAGPOL, the IAG imaging polarimeter (Magalh\u00e3es et al. 1996), at the Observat\u00f3rio\ndo Pico dos Dias (OPD), Brazil. Additional details about\nthis instrument can be found in Pereyra (2000) and Pereyra\n& Magalh\u00e3es (2002).\nThe 0.6m and 1.6m LNA telescopes were used in several\nruns between 2003 and 2005. The CamIV infrared camera\nwith an H broadband filter was used along with IAGPOL.\nCamIV is based on a HAWAII detector (manufactured by\nRockwell Sci.) of 1024\u00d71024 pixels and 18.5 \u03bcm/pixel that\nyields a plate scale of 0.00 5/pixel and 0.00 25/pixel at the 0.6m\nand 1.6m telescopes, respectively. The retarders used by\n\nIAGPOL were an achromatic \u03bb/2-waveplate centered in\n800nm (manufactured by Meadowlark Optics, Inc.) and an\nachromatic \u03bb/4-waveplate optimized to NIR (manufactured\nby B. Halle Nachfl1 ). Each object was observed through\neight waveplate positions (WP) separated by 22.\u25e6 5 with five\ndithered images per WP. A total of (8\u00d75=) 40 images were\ngathered per object. Density filters were used when appropriate.\nAt each WP the sky was computed using the mode of\nthe dithered positions. After sky subtraction, flat correction and registration of the images, the PCCDPACK package (Pereyra 2000) was used to compute the polarimetric\nparameters. The CamIV's detector yielded a typical area of\n80 and 40 for the 0.6 and 1.6m telescopes, respectively. A log\nof observation is shown in Table 1 along with optical and\nNIR magnitudes and extinction estimates for each object.\nObservations of unpolarized stars through a Glan prism\nyielded the effective retardation (\u03c4 ), the fiducial zero point\nof the system (zero), and the polarimetric efficiency of the\ninstrument in each run. The efficiency was always close to\n100% for each (\u03c4 , zero) solution and no efficiency correction\nwas applied to the data. Observations of polarized standard\nstars in each run yielded the position angle correction to\nthe equatorial system (PAcorr ). Unpolarized standard stars\nwere used to check the instrumental polarization. This was\nfound to be less than 0.3%; no such correction was then\napplied to the data. A summary of the calibration data for\neach run is shown in Table 2.\nThe selection criteria of our sample was YSOs optically\nvisible and with measured optical polarization (at least in\none epoch) higher than 1% (see Table 3). A summary of\nthe temporal evolution of the optical polarization (mainly\nat V band) for the objects of our sample is also included in\nTable 3. The observation epoch for the optical polarization\ndata is also indicated along with the number of measurements per epoch (N ), with mean values quoted.\n\n3. Results\n3.1. Observed Polarization\nThe observed polarization for the objects of our sample is\nshown in Table 4. Column (2) shows the aperture radius\n(in arcsecs) of the observations. These are computed for\na serie of apertures around the object; we select the one\nthat minimized the polarization accuracy. This accuracy is\ncalculated from the spread of the measurements at each\nWP with regards to the 4-cosine curve. Columns (3) and\n(4) show the observed polarization in H band along with\nits PA, respectively. As we can note, the NIR polarization\nlevel is higher than 1% for all cases except in three T Tauri\nstars (AS 352A, RY Tau, and UY Aur) and one Herbig\nAe/Be (MWC 297). Rather high observed polarization levels (higher than 4%) are found in three TTS (V536 Aql,\nHL Tau and LkH\u03b1 358) and in one HeAeBeS (PDS 406).\nOnly three TTS (RY Tau, DG Tau, and HL Tau) of\nour sample have a previous NIR polarization measurement\nin H band (see Table 7).

Foreground Polarization\nIn order to estimate the NIR foreground polarization toward each target, we searched the literature for previous\nsuch estimates in the optical. Four objects have the optical foreground polarization already computed: AS 353A\n(Monin et al. 2006), RY Tau (Petrov et al. 1999), MWC 297\n(Hillenbrand et al. 1992), and WW Vul (Grinin et al. 1988).\nAdditional optical foreground polarization for seven objects of our sample was obtained from a polarimetric survey of HeAeBeS (Rodrigues et al. 2009). In this survey,\nthe foreground polarization was estimated by the weighted\naverage of the polarization of field stars within typically\n100 \u00d7100 around the objects. This foreground estimate was\nchoosen when more than one computation was available (as\nin MWC 297 and WW Vul).\nWe assumed that the foreground polarization\ncan be represented by a standard Serkowski law,\nP = Pmax exp[\u2212K ln2 (\u03bbmax /\u03bb)] (Serkowski et al. 1975),\nwith the maximum polarization, Pmax , assumed to be at\n\u03bbmax = 0.55\u03bcm and the parameter K depending on \u03bbmax\nfollowing the relationship of Whittet et al. (1992). Then, we\nextrapolated the Serkowski relation to the NIR wavelength\nand obtained the proper foreground polarization for H\nband (1.65\u03bcm). We have assumed that the foreground PA\nis constant with wavelength. The foreground polarization\ncomputed in this way is 1/3 of the Pmax assumed and\nis shown in columns (5) and (6) of Table 4. Column (7)\nindicates the number of the field objects used to compute\nthe foreground polarization by Rodrigues et al. (2009). In\ngeneral, a better statistic (N ) will yield a more precise\nestimator.\nFor the nine objects whose foreground correction is\navailable, just two (RY Tau and MWC 297) appear with a\n\nforeground polarization level higher than the observed one.\nNevertheless, in all the cases, the foreground correction is\nlower than 1% and as expected we have a substantial reduction in the foreground at NIR bands compared to the optical polarization. To help the comparison, Figure 1 shows\nfor each object the Stokes parameters2 Q \u2212U diagram, including the NIR observed polarization and the optical and\nNIR vectors for the foreground polarization (when available). Analyzing these diagrams, it seems clear that the\ncontribution of the foreground polarization to the observed\npolarization at NIR bands is significantly reduced.\n3.3. Intrinsic polarization\nFor those objects with an estimated foreground polarization\n(Table 3), we obtained the intrinsic polarization. As the\nforeground polarization is an additive component included\nin the observed polarization, the intrinsic Stokes parameters are as follows:\nQint = Qobs - Qfor\nUint = Uobs - Ufor .\nThe intrinsic polarization (Pint ) and its polarization angle (PAint ) are obtained from:\n2\n2 1/2\nPint = (Q int\n+ U int\n)\n\nPAint =\n2\n\n1\n2\n\narctan(Uint /Qint).\n\nQ = P cos (2\u00d7PA) and U = P sin (2\u00d7PA)\n\n\f4\n\nPereyra et al.: Near Infrared polarimetry of a sample of YSOs\n\nThe intrinsic polarization estimated for the nine objects\n(two TTS and seven HeAeBeS) are indicated in columns\n(8) and (9) of Table 4. In all cases, the intrinsic polarization levels are significant (higher than 0.9%). In seven\nobjects the difference between the observed and intrinsic\npolarization levels is less or equal to 0.3%. Only RY Tau\nand PDS 406 show larger polarization changes after the\nforeground correction (0.9% and 0.6%, respectively). In addition, seven YSOs show small changes in the PA when\ncorrecting for foreground polarization, typically similar or\nless than 10\u25e6 . Significant deviations are found in PDS 453\n(19\u25e6 ) and MWC 297 (41\u25e6 ).\nAs we can note, in general, the subtraction of the foreground polarization does not change significatively the results. For example, the extreme Pint measured for PDS 406\n(4.2%) is comparable with its Pobs (4.8%) with the PA practically unchanged. We can then confirm the small contribution of the foreground polarization. This is important if\nthe foreground polarization is not available and only PAobs\ncan be used to infer correlations with the position angle for\nthe jets/disks.\n\nFig. 2. Histogram of the \u2206pol/disk parameter used to classify the\ndisk optical depth at NIR bands. The TTS are in white boxes\nand the HeAeBeS in grey boxes.\n\n4. Discussion\n4.1. Correlations with position angles of jets and disks\nThe main focus of this work is to correlate the polarization\nPA with the directions of jets, outflows or disks/envelope\nfor the objects of our sample available in the literature. We\nfound non-polarimetric evidence of asymmetries in twelve\nobjects of our sample (eight TTS and four HeAeBeS). The\nPA for disks or jets (PAjet and PAdisk ) are indicated in\nTable 5 with their respective references.\nIn five cases, there are independent determinations of\nPAjet and PAdisk and within the uncertainties they are perpendicular. This is quantified by the parameter \u2206jet/disk in\nTable 5. For RY Tau, DG Tau, and DO Tau, PAjet and\nPAdisk are perpendicular within 4\u25e6 and for HL Tau and\nMWC 297 within 26\u25e6 .\nThe angle difference between the polarization PA and\nthe disk PA is defined as \u2206pol/disk in Table 5. For an optically thick disk, this difference is 0\u25e6 , whereas for an optically\nthin disk the difference is 90\u25e6 . We have classified the disk\noptical depth preferentially using the intrinsic polarization\nPA. If it was not available the observed one was used.\nIn the twelve objects where the comparison can be done,\nthe jet/disk PA is at least within 14\u25e6 of being parallel or\nperpendicular to the polarization PA. HL Tau and MWC\n297, the two YSOs with discrepancies between the jet and\ndisk PA, are better correlated with the disk PA. In summary, seven objects present optically thick disk and five\noptically thin disks. This is shown with a respective label\nat Table 5. Our classification is also indicated in the histogram of \u2206pol/disk (Fig. 2). Individual comments for each\nanalysed object are presented in \u00a7 5.\nIt is interesting to note that the optically thick disks\nof our sample present the highest observed polarizations\n(Fig. 3). This result is consistent with the expected enhanced polarization by multiple scattering in an optically\nthick environment (M\u00e9nard & Bastien 1992). Alternatively,\nthese polarization levels also can be explained by less dilution of the observed radiation by direct light of the central\nobject in an optically thick line of sight (as in UXOR stars\n- see next section).\n\nFig. 3. Correlation between the observed polarization at NIR\nbands and the \u2206pol/disk parameter. The TTS are in black dots\nand the HeAeBeS in grey dots.\n\n4.2. Comparing optical and NIR polarization PA - cases of\npossible reversal?\nA change in the polarization PA by 90\u25e6 when going from\nthe visible to the NIR (or polarization reversal) has been\nobserved in a couple of YSOs (T Tau and SU Aur, Hough\net al. 1981). This feature can be explained by an optically\nthick disk at the optical bands, producing a polarization\nparallel to the disk, but optically thin at NIR bands, resulting in a polarization PA perpendicular to the disk (Bastien\n& M\u00e9nard 1990).\nEvidence of polarization reversal in our sample can be\nobtained comparing the optical and NIR polarization PA\nfrom Tables 3 and 4. A direct comparison can be done analizing the Q \u2212U diagrams shown in Figure 1. The polarization reversal will be evident when a flip between two opposite quadrants in the the Q \u2212U diagram exists between the\noptical and NIR polarization. As the comparison is done\n\n\fPereyra et al.: Near Infrared polarimetry of a sample of YSOs\n\n5\n\nTable 2.

The indeterminacy of the disk optical depth\nof RY Ori and WW Vul prevents any conclusion about these\ntwo objects.\n\nNevertheless, within 25\u25e6 in four objects (RY Tau, UY\nAur, RY Ori and WW Vul) of our sample an polarization\nreversal seems to be present. The evidence of optically thin\ndisks at NIR bands for RY Tau and UY Aur given in \u00a7 4.1\nseems consistent with the polarization reversal model men-\n\nIn particular, the Q \u2212U diagram for RY Tau shows\na great variability already reported at optical and NIR\nbands. Our NIR polarization data on 2005/10 show a polarization reversal when comparing with the temporal evolution for the optical polarization (between 1972/01 and\n\n\f8\n\nPereyra et al.: Near Infrared polarimetry of a sample of YSOs\n\nFig. 4.

(left) The locus for the TTS (black dots) and the HeAeBeS (grey dots) is shown.\n(right) The optically thick disks (black squares) in our sample seems to ocuppy a different locus than the optically thin disks (grey\nsquares). Objects with an undetermined disk optical depth also are shown (white squares).\n\n2003/12). On the other hand, previous NIR polarization\ndata that sample an interval of \u223c2.5yr (between 1979/08\nand 1981/12) are at the same quadrant (Q > 0,U > 0) than\nthe historical optical variability. UY Aur was reported with\na suspected optical polarization variability (Bastien 1985).\nThis object shows a polarization reversal if we compare\nthe optical polarization on 1978/12/01 with our NIR polarization. However, the feature is not evident if the comparison is done with the optical data between 1979/02 and\n1980/01. In RY Ori the detection of the polarization reversal is marginal. The feature is evident only between the\nfirst of the two optical data on 1995/01/30 and our NIR\ndata. Finally, in WW Vul polarization reversal is evident\nbetween the optical data on 1998/05 and our NIR data\nbut fails if the comparison is done with the optical data on\n1998/07\u221210 and 2000/06.\nIt is interesting to note that RY Tau, RY Ori, and\nWW Vul with evidence of polarization reversal present the\nUXOR phenomenon (Grinin 1994; Yudin & Evans 1998;\nPetrov et al. 1999; Oudmaijer et al. 2001). Nevertheless, VY\nMon which also shows the UXOR behaviour (Oudmaijer et\nal. 2001) does not show the polarization reversal in our\ncomparison (Figure 1). The UXOR phenomenon is associated with an increase in polarization simultaneous to an\nabrupt decrease in the optical brightness of the central object (Grinin et al. 1994) in non-periodic variables with deep\nAlgol-type minima. This feature is explained by the effect of\ndust clumps rotating around the central star in a disk-like\nconfiguration. Clumps in our line of sight will absorb the\nlight of the central star increasing the proportion of scattered light and consequently the polarization. When the\nline of sight is free of clumps, the star will become bright\nagain and the contribution of the scattered light will be\nreduced along with the polarization. In the optical bands,\npolarization PA flips are common in stars with the UXOR\nphenomenon. For example, UX Ori (the prototype for the\nUXOR phenomenon) shows after the minimum a rapid in-\n\ncrease of the polarization level followed by a gradual polarization PA flip of \u223c90\u25e6 (Grinin 1994). A similar behavior also was reported for WW Vul with a polarization PA\nflip of \u223c60\u25e6 (Grinin et al. 1988) and recently for CO Ori\n(Rostopchina et al. 2007, PA flip \u223c90\u25e6 ).\nIn RY Tau the historical NIR polarization PA variability\nwould imply significant changes between an optically thick\ndisk between 1979/08\u22121981/12 (Hough et al. 1981; Moneti\net al. 1984) and an optically thin disk in our NIR data.\nThese changes are probably associated with the screening\neffect by clumps following the UXOR behavior.\n4.3. IRAS colours and spectral index\nIn order to determine if any correlations exist between\nthe disk optical depth computed in \u00a7 4.1 with the IRAS\ncolours, we plotted in Fig. 4 the IRAS colour diagram\nfor our sample. The far-IR colours were calculated using\n[\u03bbi \u2212 \u03bbj ] = 2.5 log[F (\u03bbj )/F (\u03bbi )], where F (\u03bb) are the IRAS\nfluxes (Table 6). Only V895 Sco and LkH\u03b1 358 have no\nIRAS counterpart. The HeAeBeS and TTs are spanned\nin an approximately homogeneous range on the diagram\n(Fig. 4, left). However, when the positions on the diagram\nare classified by the disk optical depth is evident a segregation between the two subsamples (Fig. 4, right). The\noptically thick disks present more far-IR emission than the\noptically thin ones and an evolutionary segregation is evident. For completeness, we also plotted the objects with\nundetermined disk optical depth. If the segregation is true,\nthe objects with more far-IR emission are expected to have\noptically thick disks.\nAnother way to check the last result is computing the spectral index for the objects of our\nsample with a well determined disk optical depth\n(Fig. 5). We used the classification by Lada (1987) with\n\u03b1(K , 25) = log[\u03bb25 FK /(\u03bbK F25 )]/log(\u03bbK /\u03bb25 ) representing\nthe spectral index between the 2MASS K band and the\n\n\fPereyra et al.: Near Infrared polarimetry of a sample of YSOs\n\n9\n\nTable 6.

For class I sources 0 < \u03b1 \u2264 3\nand for class II sources -2 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 0. Clearly, all the optically\nthin disks are associated to class II sources. On the other\nhand, the optically thick disks appear equally distributed\nbetween the two evolutionary classes. The link between the\nclass II objects and the optically thin disks reinforces the\nidea of an evolutionary segregation for the YSOs disks. If\nthis is correct, we have found evidence that the disks in\nYSOs tend to be optically thin when they are older. This\npicture is consistent with the final phases of the disk evolution in the standard star formation model (Shu et al. 1987).\n\nFig. 5. Spectral index \u03b1(K , 25) for the YSOs in our sample\nwith \u2206pol/disk parameter determined. Class I and II sources are\nequally distributed in optically thick disks.

Our measurements do not resolve the system but the NIR polarization\nPA (25\u25e6 \u00b11\u25e6 ) is approximately parallel to the binary PA\naxis and also perpendicular to the bipolar outflow (Fig. 7).\nProbably, the NIR polarization is produced in an optically\nthick dusty (and circumbinary?) disk.\n5.1.3. RY Tau\n\nAS 353A is a TTS member of a binary system with a separation of 5.00 7 (Reipurth & Zinnecker 1993). The aperture\nradius used in our measurement is 1.00 3 that avoids contamination by the companion. The outflow axis direction,\nPA =107\u25e6 (or PA =287\u25e6 ), is well determined by the relative\npositions of its associated HH objects (HH 32A-D, Hartigan\net al. 1986) and proper motions (Curiel et al. 1997). Our\nNIR polarization PA (125\u25e6 \u00b11\u25e6 ) is approximately parallel to the outflow axis. If we consider the ISP correction\n(PA =114\u25e6\u00b11\u25e6 ), the correlation is even better (Fig. 6). This\nis consistent with the NIR polarization being produced in\nan optically thin disk.\n\nAn estimate of the disk PA is found in Kitamura et al.\n(2002, PA =27\u25e6 \u00b17\u25e6 ) using 2mm thermal dust continuum\nemission, and Koerner & Sargent (1995, PA =48\u25e6 \u00b15\u25e6 ) using CO(2\u21921) emission. Considering the consistent disk evidence from CO and 2mm emission, the NIR polarization\nPA (127\u25e6 \u00b11\u25e6 ) is approximately perpendicular to the disk\nPA. The correlation is even better if we consider the correction by ISP (PAint =120\u25e6\u00b10.\u25e6 4, Table 3). Recently, St-Onge\n& Bastien (2008) using H\u03b1\u2212continuum Gemini imaging reported a bipolar jet from RY Tau with PA =115\u25e6 and approximately parallel to our NIR polarization PA (Fig. 8).\nThis seems to confirm that an optically thin disk is more\nlikely in RY Tau. Nevertheless, previous NIR polarization\nmeasurements have been reported with polarization PA different to our value (see Table 7). This is a clear indication\nof a great variability of this source also at the NIR bands.\nAs we noted in \u00a7 4.2 probably the UXOR phenomenon can\nexplain the large variations on the polarization PA.\n\n5.1.2. V536 Aql\n\n5.1.4. DG Tau\n\nV536 Aql is a classical TTS (CTTS). Optical polarimetric\nvariability was reported by M\u00e9nard & Bastien (1992) with\na range of polarization \u223c[5.5\u22128.5]% and PA \u223c[40\u221270]\u25e6\nmeasured during about 9 yrs. Subarcsecond NIR imaging (Ageorges et al. 1994) for V536 Aql detected a binary\nsystem with a PA axis \u223c17\u25e6 and an angular distance of\n\u223c0.500 . Evidence of the outflow/jet axis was found by Hirth\net al. (1997) using long-slit spectra of forbidden emission\n\nThe NIR polarization PA (128\u25e6 \u00b12\u25e6 ) is roughly perpendicular to the jet direction (PA =222\u25e6) obtained from\n[OI]\u2212continuum maps (Lavalley et al. 1997). Evidence of\na Keplerian disk rotating perpendicular to the jet is found\nby Testi et al. (2002) using 13 CO wing emission. Therefore,\nthe NIR polarization PA is also parallel to the disk as expected in an optically thick dusty disk (Fig. 9). It is interesting to note that previous published polarization data in\n\n5.

Therefore, this is consistent with an optically\nthick disk in LkH\u03b1 358 (Fig. 12).\n5.1.8. UY Aur\nUY Aur is a binary system with a separation of \u223c0.00 9 and a\nbinary axis with PA =225\u25e6 (Leinert et al. 1993). NIR polarization maps at high angular resolution (Potter et al. 2000)\nyielded a PA for the circumbinary disk of 135\u25e6. The large\ncircumbinary disk begins \u223c200 from the center of the binary\nsystem and goes up to \u223c500 . We selected a radius aperture\nof 600 to properly cover the circumbinary disk. Our NIR\npolarization PA is 33\u25e6 \u00b15\u25e6 approximately perpendicular to\nthe disk PA. It seems consistent with a probably optically\nthin circumbinary disk in UY Aur.\n5.2. Herbig Ae/Be stars\n5.2.1. PDS 406\n\nH band for DG Tau (see Table 7) show a higher polarization level but with the PA consistent with ours within 10\u25e6 .\nTherefore, the polarimetric variability seems not connected\nwith geometric changes in the material distribution.\n5.1.5. DO Tau\nThe NIR polarization PA (166\u25e6 \u00b11\u25e6 ) is consistent with\nthe optical value (PA =170\u25e6, Bastien 1982). Hirth et al.\n(1994) detected the optical jet direction (PA =70\u25e6 ) using\n[SII]. Koerner & Sargent (1995) determined the disk PA\n(160\u25e6 \u00b19\u25e6 ) from CO(2\u21921) emission. The optical jet and the\nCO emission seem consistent with the NIR polarization PA\nbeing produced in an optically thick dusty disk (Fig. 10).\nHowever, Kitamura et al. (2002) estimated a different (and\nperpendicular) disk PA (67\u25e6 \u00b19\u25e6 ) from dust thermal emission at 2mm. Probably, this discrepancy can be explained\nby the poorly resolved dust emission. The difference between the longer and smaller disk axes, in that work, is\nlower than 20%.\n5.1.6. HL Tau\nHL Tau is a well studied T Tauri star. Mundt et al.\n(1990) determined the jet direction (PA =51\u25e6) using\n[SII]\u2212continuum imaging. Several works using different\ntechniques determined a consistent disk PA around 125\u25e6\n(Lay et al. 1994; Mundy et al. 1996; Wilner et al. 1996;\nClose et al. 1997; Murakawa et al. 2008). Different disk\nPA are found in Sargent & Beckwith (1991, PA =160\u25e6),\nStapelfeldt et al. (1995, PA =145\u25e6), Kitamura et al. (2002,\nPA =144\u25e6 \u00b12\u25e6 ), Lucas et al. (2004, PA =136\u25e6\u00b18\u25e6 ), and\nRodmann et al. (2006, PA =170\u25e6 \u00b130\u25e6). The jet and disk\nevidence along with our NIR polarization PA (124\u25e6 \u00b11\u25e6 )\nare consistent with an optically thick dusty disk in HL Tau\n(Fig. 11).\n5.1.7. LkH\u03b1 358\nRecently, Moriarty-Schieven et al. (2006) have suggested\nthat LkH\u03b1 358 has a jet with PA =72\u25e6. This jet direction is rigorously perpendicular to the NIR polarization PA\n\nPDS 406 is a Herbig Ae star, still embedded in its parental\ncloud, as suggested by the significant visual extinction\n(AV =1, Chen et al. 1997) and the high NIR foreground polarization (0.7%, Table 3) toward this object. As we noted\nin \u00a7 3.3, PDS 406 is interesting because it is the object in\nour sample with the largest Pint (4.2%). Viera et al. (2003)\ndetected an H\u03b1 double peak that may indicate a rotating disk. Low resolution (3000 ) maps from 12 CO(J=2\u21921)\n(Tachihara et al. 1996) did not detect molecular outflows\nin PDS 406. High-resolution measurements are needed for\nthis object.\n5.2.2. Hen 3-1191\nThe nature of Hen 3-1191 is not clear. It was classified as\na proto-planetary nebula (PPN) by Le Bertre et al. (1989).\nHowever, De Winter et al. (1994) concluded that Hen 31191 is likely a pre-main sequence star. Imaging in R band\n(Le Bertre et al. 1989) shows clearly a bipolar structure\nwith an axis oriented NW-SE (PA \u223c48\u25e6). The NIR polarization PA (51\u25e6 \u00b11\u25e6 , corrected by ISP) is rigorously parallel\nto the bipolar axis (Fig. 13). This is consistent with scattering in an optically thin disk in Hen 3-1191. Recently,\nLachaume et al. (2007) resolved Hen 3-1191 at N band (813\u03bcm) with VLTI/MIDI and found a disk PA of 1\u25e6 \u00b14\u25e6 . The\ndisagreement with our measurement may be related with\nthe high angular resolution (24-36mas) from Lachaume et\nal. (2007) that maps the more interior disk region.\n5.2.3. PDS 453\nPDS 453 was classified as a possible PPN by Kohoutek\n(1997) \u2013 see also Garc\u0131\u0301a-Lario et al. (1997). On the\nother hand, Vieira et al. (2003) classify PDS 453 as a\nHerbig Ae/Be candidate but without a clear association\nto star-forming regions (possibly LDN 1767 and/or 1773).\nRecently, Perrin (2006) at NIR bands detected a possible\npolarization disk with PA \u223c45\u25e6 explained by multiple scattering. This PA is approximately parallel to our NIR polarization PA (58\u25e6 \u00b13\u25e6 , corrected by ISP) and consistent with\nan optically thick disk.\n\n\fPereyra et al.: Near Infrared polarimetry of a sample of YSOs\n\n5.2.4. MWC 297\nMWC 297 is a Herbig Be star with a well-defined spectral\ntype (B1.5Ve, Drew et al. 1997). Monnier et al. (2006) using NIR interferometry estimated an elongation of the inner\ndisk with a PA \u223c100\u25e6. This disk PA is approximately parallel to our NIR polarization PA (114\u25e6 \u00b18\u25e6 , corrected by\nISP) and consistent with the NIR polarization produced\nby multiple scattering (Fig. 14). This seems to confirm\nprevious evidence of an optically thick disk by fitting the\nSED at mm/submm (Mannings 1994) and modeling NIR\ninterferometry data (Malbet et al. 2007). Consistent with\nthis scenario, the radio emission associated with this source\n(PA =164\u25e6, Drew et al. 1997) is marginally perpendicular\nwith respect to our NIR polarization PA.\n5.2.5. VV Ser\nVV Ser is a Herbig Ae star. Eisner at al. (2004) estimated\na disk PA in the 165-173\u25e6 range using NIR interferometry.\nRecently, Pontoppidan et al. (2007) studied and modeled\nSpitzer data of IR continuum and PAH emission for this object with a disk shadow PA shadow of 15\u25e6 \u00b15\u25e6 . Our NIR polarization PA (98\u25e6 \u00b17\u25e6 , corrected by ISP) is approximately\nperpendicular to the disk PA from Eisner et al. (2004) and\nPontoppidan et al. (2007). Therefore, an optically thin disk\nis more likely in VV Ser (Fig. 15).\n5.2.6. VY Mon\nVY Mon is an eruptive, highly reddened (AV \u223c7.4mag),\nAlgol-like variable Herbig Ae/Be star. VY Mon is associated with the reflection nebula IC 446 (1.50 north) and a\nBok globule (1.50 south). There is not clear evidence for\na jet/disk in VY Mon. However, evidence of asymmetry\nwas found by modeling the FIR emission (Casey & Harper\n1990). Henning et al. (1998) also found K -band and milimeter emissions slightly extended to the south of VY Mon. Our\nNIR polarization PA (3\u25e6 \u00b12\u25e6 ) is parallel to the axis defined\nby IC 446 and the Bok globule and also by the millimeter\nemission. However, it is not clear whether the dust emission\n(from de Bok globule) and the reflection nebula are tracing\nthe same direction as the circumstellar disk.\n\n6. Conclusions\nWe present NIR polarimetric measurements of a sample\nof YSOs. Except for RY Tau, DG Tau, and HL Tau, the\nremaining sixteen objects have their NIR polarization published by the first time.\nEight TTS and four HeAeBeS of our sample have its\njet/disk orientation determined by other means. It enables\nus to correlate the NIR polarization PA with the disk PA\nand hence to determine the optical depth of the disk. Three\nTTS present optically thin disks (AS 353A, RY Tau, and\nUY Aur) and five optically thick disks (V536 Aql, DG Tau,\nDO Tau HL Tau, and LkH\u03b1 358). On the other hand, two\nHeAeBeS show evidence of optically thin disk (Hen 3-1191\nand VV Ser) and two of optically thick disks (PDS 453 and\nMWC 297). Therefore, considering the objects with correlations available, we found that \u223c60% (7 of 12 objects) have\noptically thick disks at NIR bands. Our statistics is limited\nbut our sample seems to confirm the trend of optically thick\n\n11\n\ndisks in YSOs (M\u00e9nard & Bastien 1992; Maheswar et al.\n2002) obtained at the optical bands.\nMarginal evidence for polarization reversal between the\noptical and NIR bands is found in four objects (RY Tau,\nUY Aur, RY Ori, and WW Vul). The presence of optically thin disks on the epoch of our observations for RY\nTau and UY Aur given by the correlation between the NIR\npolarization and the jet/disk PA seems consistent with the\npolarization reversal model. Interestingly, RY Tau, RY Ori,\nand WW Vul, which show evidence of polarization reversal,\npresent the UXOR behavior. In particular, RY Tau shows\nhistorical changes on the disk optical depth at NIR bands\nthat we believe influenced by the presence of eventual dust\nclumps on the line of sight associated to the UXOR behavior. Probably, RY Ori and WW Vul must have a similar\nbehavior but more data are necessary to better constrain\nthis issue.\nFinally, we show a correlation between the IRAS colours\nand the disk optical depth. The optically thick disks are located in a place on the colour diagram that corresponds\nto larger values of far-IR emission. This can be interpreted\nas an evolutionary segregation. It is corroborated by the\nfact that only objects classified as Class II sources by their\nspectral indexes present optically thin disks. Therefore, polarimetric measurements at NIR bands along with an independent evidence of the geometry of the PA disk can potentially help to constrain the evolutionary stage of YSOs.\nAcknowledgements.
