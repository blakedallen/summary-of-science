Branes,\ndefined as extended objects in spacetime, can be fundamental or solitonic. The\nconnection of these branes with a U(1) gauge field was motivated by the presence of this field in the massless part of the spectrum of open strings, and by\nrealising that branes with open strings attached to them which satisfy Dirichlet\n\u2217\n\nEmail:dkpark@genphys.kyungnam.ac.kr\nEmail: sayat@moon.yerphi.am\n\u2021\nEmail:mueller1@physik.uni-kl.de\n\u2021\nEmail:jzzhang @online.sh.cn\n\u2020\n\n1\n\n\fboundary conditions, or more generally one brane attached to another, can become classically stable, solitonic objects. It is for this reason that the dynamics\nof D-branes [3] in Born\u2013Infeld theory is being studied in detail and generalised\n[4],[5],[6],[7],[8]. Since, in general, a brane may or may not be a solitonic configuration or BPS state, the exploration of this question deserves particular attention.\nIt is often stated that a brane is BPS in view of the vanishing of a fraction of\nthe supersymmetry variation of the associated gaugino field. However, since BPS\nstates (as classically and topologically stable states) and Bogomol'nyi bounds\nhave been studied in great detail in a host of other theories, and the approach in\nthese is practically standard, one would like to understand aspects of Born\u2013Infeld\nparticles in a similar way, also because it is not absolutely clear that D\u2013branes\nare solitons of string theory in precisely the same way as more familiar topological solitons in field theory. Therefore our first intention in the following is to\nstudy Born\u2013Infeld particles with standard methods of nonlinear dynamics in the\nsimplest case of a flat spacetime. We begin with the free Born\u2013Infeld particles,\ni.e. BIon and catenoid [4]. Using a scale transformation argument [9] we show\nthat these static configurations \u2013 which differ from ordinary solitons of nonlinear\ntheories in requiring a special consideration of source terms or boundary conditions (cf. also [10],[11]) \u2013 require the number of space dimensions p to be larger\nthan 2. We assume spherical symmetry and study the local stability of these\nconfigurations by considering the second variational derivatives of their respective actions. Our conditions for stability are a) that the eigenfunctions of the\ncorresponding operator be square integrable, and b) that the charge e be fixed,\nwith angular fluctuations ignored. We then consider the case of the scalar field\ncorresponding to a single transverse coordinate coupled to the gauge field (here\nonly the electric component), i.e. the catenoid or brane with associated open\nfundamental string. We distinguish between two types of arguments in deriving\nthe linearised fluctuation equation, and infer the stability of this stringy D-brane.\nIn ref.[12] an explicit and detailed consideration of the Bogomol'nyi bound in a\nspecial model of Born\u2013Infeld theory has been given where the central charge of\nthe supersymmetry algebra plays the role of the topological or winding number\nof ordinary solitons.\nOur second intention in the following is the explicit study of the small fluctuation equation about the D3\u2013brane in the high energy domain. This equation\nwith singular potential has the remarkable property of being convertible into a\nmodified Mathieu equation which depends only on one coupling parameter which\nis a product of energy and electric charge. The S\u2013matrix for scattering of the\nfluctuation off the brane can be obtained in explicit form. The D3\u2013brane is\ntherefore one of the very rare examples allowing a detailed study of its properties\nwith explicit expressions for all relevant physical quantities in both low and high\nenergy domains. We therefore expect that also S\u2013duality can be uncovered and\nstudied in this case (although we do not attempt this here). Various other Dp\u2013\nbrane models have been discovered recently whose small fluctuation equations\ncan be reduced to modified Mathieu equations [13, 14, 15] which have then been\ninvestigated mainly by computational methods. For the AdS/CFT correspondence the logarithmic corrections to the low energy absorption probability are\nof particular interest, since these permit a direct relation to the discontinuity of\n2\n\n\fthe cut in the correlation function of the dual two\u2013dimensional quantum field\ntheory. The first such logarithmic correction to the absorption probability was\noriginally obtained in refs.[16, 17, 18] without resorting to the use of Mathieu\nfunctions. Subsequently the authors of ref. [13] considered the modified Mathieu\nequation and used computational methods to generate explicit series expansions\nup to several orders for the low energy absorption probability. In [19] a different\nchoice of expansions was considered to obtain leading expressions more easily. It\nis natural to supplement such investigations by exploring also the high energy\ncase, the first such consideration being that of ref.[15]. The analytical high energy results obtained in the following and the complementary low energy results\nof ref. [19] (we also demonstrate how the S\u2013matrices are related) are therefore\ndirectly applicable to these. Singular potentials have been studied from time to\ntime, and have mostly been discarded as pathological. It seems, however, that\ntheir real significance lies in the context of curved spaces with black\u2013hole type of\nabsorption [20].\nSections 2 and 3 deal with the BIon and the catenoid, sections 4 and 5 with\nthe Bogomol'nyi limit of the D3\u2013brane and the derivation of the linearised fluctuation equation about it. In section 6 we consider this equation in detail in the\nhigh energy domain and calculate the rate of absorption of partial waves of the\nfluctuation field by the brane. That this absorption occurs is attributed to the\nsingularity of the potential. The absorptivity part of the paper may be looked at\nas the high energy complement to the low energy case of ref.[19] with the same\nexpression of the S\u2013matrix. All these calculations require a matching of wave\nfunctions. In the low energy S\u2013wave case simple considerations of Bessel and\nHankel functions suffice as was shown in refs. [21]. The low energy limit is, in\nfact, independent of the choice of matching point, as was shown recently [22].\nOur considerations here, however, are general.\n\n2\n\nThe BIon\n\nWe consider first purely static cases and write the Lagrangian of the static BIon\nin p + 1 spacetime dimensions (cf.[4])\np\n\nL=\n\nZ\n\np\n\nd xL, L = 1 \u2212\n\nq\n\n1 \u2212 (\u2202i\n\n\u03c6)2\n\np\u03c0 2\n\u2212 \u03a3p e\u03c6\u03b4(r), \u03a3p = p\n( 2 )!\n\n(1)\n\n(i = 1, * * *, p) with the charge e held fixed by the constraint\ne+\n\n1\n\u03a3p\n\nZ\n\n\u2202i \u03c6\n=0\nd\u03c3i q\n1 \u2212 (\u2202j \u03c6)2\n\n(2)\n\nEq.

The field A\u03bc is assumed to\n3\n\n\fdepend on the world brane coordinates x\u03bc , \u03bc = 0, * * *, p. The static BIon equation\nof motion is\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u2202\n\u03c6\ni\n\uf8f8 = \u2212\u03a3p e\u03b4(r)\n(3)\n\u2202i \uf8ed q\n2\n1 \u2212 (\u2202i \u03c6)\n\nIn the special case p = 3 the classical SO(3) symmetric solution, called a BIon,\nis given by\n\u03c6c (r) =\n\nZ\n\nr\n\ndx\n\n\u221e\n\nq\n\n1+\n\nx4\ne2\n\n= \u03c6c (0) \u2212\n\nZ\n\ndx\n\nr\n0\n\n1\n\nq\n\n1+\n\nr\u21920\nx4\ne2\n\n\u2243\n\n\"\n\nr5\n\u03c6c (0) \u2212 r +\n10e2\n\n#\n\n(4)\n\n1\n\nand \u03c6c (0) = 41 B( 41 , 14 ).e 2 = 1.854074677.e 2 , B being the Bernoulli function. It\nis easily verified that this solution satisfies the constraint (2) for any value of r.\nDefining E = \u2212\u2207\u03c6c (so that \u03c6c = A0 with \u2202A0 (xi , t)/\u2202t = 0 in the static case),\n\u2202L\nE\nand defining D = \u2202E\n= \u221a1\u2212E\n2 we have (with F0i = Ei )\nT00 = F0i\n\n\u2202L\n1\n\u2212 1 + 4\u03c0e\u03c6\u03b4(r)\n\u2212L= E*D\u2212L= \u221a\n\u2202F0i\n1 \u2212 E2\n\n(5)\n\nThe energy Hc of the BIon (obtained by integration over R3 ) is then found to be\nfinite, i.e.\nZ\n3\nHc = dxT00 = 4\u03c0(3.09112).e 2\n(6)\np\n\nand in p dimensions the total energy of the BIon scales correspondingly as e p\u22121 .\nThe finiteness of the energy depends on the minus sign in (1) and so with (3) on\nthe relation\nq\nr2\nr2\n1 \u2212 (\u03c6\u2032c )2 = \u2212 \u03c6\u2032c = q\n(7)\n4\ne\ne 1 + r2\ne\n\nfor 0 \u2264 r \u2264 \u221e. It may be noted that by defining D such that the left hand side\nof eq.(3) is \u2202i Di , the singularity of the right hand side is associated with D rather\nthan with E which is the decisive difference between Maxwell and Born\u2013Infeld\nelectrodynamics. A similar observation applies to the catenoid equation below.\nThe energy of the BIon is seen to be independent of its position which hints at\nthe existence of some kind of collective coordinate. However, exploring this point\nfurther is expected to be difficult since a moving charge generates a magnetic\nfield, and hence the electric field alone would not suffice.\nWe can use a scaling argument [9] to show that here finite energy configurations require p to be larger than or equal to 3. Under a scale transformation\nx \u2192 x\u2032 = \u03bbx, \u03c6(x) \u2192 \u03c6\u03bb (x) = \u03c6(\u03bbx), \u2202i \u03c6(x) \u2192 [\u2202i \u03c6(x)]\u03bb = \u03bb\u2202i \u03c6(\u03bbx). The charge\ne defined by the constraint (2) also changes under the scale transformation, i.e.\ne \u2192 e\u03bb = \u2212\n\n1\n\u03bbp\u22122 \u03a3p\n\nZ\n\nIn particular for p = 3 and radial symmetry\n(p=3)\n\ne\u03bb\n\n=\n\nd\u03c3i \u2202i \u03c6\nq\n\n1 \u2212 \u03bb2 (\u2202j \u03c6)2\n\n1\nr2\nq\n\u03bb 1 \u2212 \u03bb2 +\n4\n\nr4\ne2\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\n\fand for arbitrary values of \u03bb the r\u2013dependence drops out only if the limit r \u2192 \u221e\nis taken in the evaluation of the integral. Then\n(p=3)\n\ne\u03bb\n\nr\u2192\u221e\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\ne\n\n1\n\u03bb\n\n(10)\n\nBut also e\u03bb=1 = e for any r. If \u03c6c is stable and 6= 0, the energy must be\nstationary for \u03bb = 1, i.e. (\u2202Hc /\u2202\u03bb)\u03bb=1 = 0. From this one finds that p \u2265 3.\nAlso (\u2202 2 Hc /\u2202\u03bb2 )\u03bb=1 > 0 for p \u2265 3. Eqs.(6) and (10) show that changing the\nscale changes both the charge and the energy, i.e. if the charge were variable,\none could lower the energy and hence the configuration could be unstable. But\nfixing the charge (e.g. by a quantisation condition) no instability is implied by\nthe scaling condition.\nWe investigate the stability of the BIon further in the special and exemplary\ncase of p = 3 by considering the second functional variation of the static Lagrangian evaluated at \u03c6c (r).

Here the scalar\nfield y(xi , t) originates from gauge field components Aa for a = p + 1, * * *, (d \u2212\n1), d =dimension, which represent transverse displacements of the brane; here we\nconsider the case of only one such transverse coordinate, i.e. y, all d \u2212 p \u2212 1 of\nwhich are essentially Kaluza\u2013Klein remnants of the d = 10 dimensional N = 1\nelectrodynamics after dimensional reduction to p + 1 dimensions.

The\ndomain r \u2264 r0 is the nonsingular throat region (i.e. yc (r0 )) is finite). One may\nobserve that the singularity on the right hand side of eq.(25) is associated with\n\n7\n\n\fthe entire expression on the left whereas, like \u2202i \u03c6c in the BIon case, so now here\n\u2207yc is finite, i.e. the p-brane or single throat solution is given by\n\u2212\n\nyc (r) =(+)\n\nZ\n\nr\n\n\u221e\n\nr0p\u22121\ndr q\nr 2p\u22122 \u2212 r02p\u22122\n\n(28)\n\nThus y is double valued. The two possible signs can be taken to define a brane\nand its antibrane. We show at the end of this section that the solution with\nthe minus sign is the minimum of the action and the solution with the plus\nsign the maximum of the action. This function is finite at r = r0 and can be\nexpressed in terms of elliptic integrals. For r0 = 1 it is even simpler and has\n\u2212\n\nthe value yc (1) =(+) \u221a12 K( \u221a12 ) where K is the complete elliptic integral of the\nfirst kind. Plotted as a function of r, yc (r) is a monotonically decreasing function\nstarting from r0 ; pictured on a 2\u2013dimensional space it looks like an inverted funnel\n(i.e. the surface swept out by a catenary with boundaries at the openings), thus\nsuggesting the name catenoid. As pointed out in ref.[2], the two possible signs\nof the square root allow a smooth joining of one such funnel\u2013shaped branch to\nan inverted one connected by a throat of finite thickness, the resulting structure\nthen representing a brane\u2013antibrane pair. This brane\u2013antibrane pair is joined by\nthe throat of finite thickness r0 and finite length. In fact, we can rewrite eq.(28)\nin terms of \u1ef9c (x) = yc (r0 x), x = rr0 , and for the special case of p = 3 as\n+ Z x\n\u2212 Z \u221e\ndx\ndx\ndx\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(\u2212)\n=\n(+)\n1\nx\n1\nx4 \u2212 1\nx4 \u2212 1\nx4 \u2212 1\n\u221a !#\n\u221a !\n\"\n\u2212\n2\n2\n1\n1\n\u2212 cn\u22121\n,\n= (+) \u221a K\n2\nx 2\n2\n\u2212\n\n\u1ef9c (x) = (+)\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u221a\n\n(29)\n\nwhere x > 1 and we used formulae of ref.[23].

Obviously the operator B\u0302 with the\nplus sign has no positive eigenvalues, which means that we have the maximum\nof the action. Of course, if we change r0 (and so consider a different theory),\nthe expectation value of B\u0302 also changes. One should note that the free throat\nwe discuss here is that with vanishing gauge field. The double valuedness of the\nsolution of eq.(25) implies that if one solution is classically stable, the other one\nis not. Thus a multi\u2013throat solution constructed from these by matching both\nsolutions, if it exists, like the brane\u2013antibrane solution of ref.[2], is expected to\nbe unstable in view of negative as well as positive eigenvalues, and is therefore\nneither a maximum nor a minimum of the action. In fact, as argued in ref.[4]\n(after eq.(132)) equilibrium between these should not be possible. The reason for\nthis is that a symmetrical configuration, symmetrical about the plane x3 = 0 for\ninstance, implies \u22023 y = 0 there. Evaluating the stress tensor element T33 (even\nfor vanishing gauge field), one obtains a negative quantity which is interpreted\nas implying an attractive force between the brane and its antibrane in this symmetrically constructed configuration. This is, in fact, the general instability of\nthis configuration discussed in ref.[2].\n\n10\n\n\f4\n\nCoupled fields: The D\u2013brane in the Bogomol'nyi limit\n\nIn the case of coupled fields \u03c6 and y (the former with source, the latter without),\nthe Lagrangian of the static case is (cf.[4])\nL =\n\nZ\n\nQ =\n\n\u0014\n\ndp xL, L = 1 \u2212 Q \u2212 \u03a3p e\u03c6\u03b4(r),\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1 \u2212 (\u2202i \u03c6) + (\u2202i y) + (\u2202i \u03c6.\u2202i y) \u2212 (\u2202i \u03c6) (\u2202j y)\n\n2\n\n\u00151\n2\n\n(40)\n\n\u00bfFrom the first variation of L we obtain the coupled equations of the fields \u03c6 and\ny, i.e. from\n1\n[\u2202i \u03c6 \u2212 (\u2207\u03c6 * \u2207y)\u2202i y + (\u2207y)2\u2202i \u03c6]dp x\nQ\nZ\n1\n+\n\u03b4y\u2202i [\u2202i y + (\u2207\u03c6 * \u2207y)\u2202i \u03c6 \u2212 (\u2207\u03c6)2 \u2202i y]dp x\nQ\nZ\n\n\u03b4L = \u2212\n\n\u03b4\u03c6\u2202i\n\n\u2212 \u03a3p e\n\nZ\n\n\u03b4\u03c6\u03b4(r)dp x\n\n(41)\n\n(ignoring total divergences).\nThe source term of the electric field again suggests spherical symmetry.

Thus a2 = 1 implies\nBPS configurations, wheras those with a2 6= 1 are non\u2013BPS. Taking a2 = 0\nin eq.(36) we regain the BIon configuration as a local minimum of the energy\nwhereas for vanishing electric field one expects a local maximum, i.e. a sphaleron\nconfiguration (as pointed out in [2]).\nNext we investigate the second variation of the static L with spherical symmetry.

This behaviour may be interpreted as indicative of a local symmetry, in this case of supersymmetry, and so of\nthe cancellation of fermionic and bosonic contributions in the one loop approximation. Here, of course, we have no fermionic contributions and consequently\nthose of the two bosonic fields have opposite signs.\n\n5\n\nFluctuations about the D\u2013brane\n\nIn the following we distinguish clearly between two different types of fluctuations.\nWe consider the above BPS solution for the string attached to the 3\u2013brane as\nbackground and consider first a scalar field propagating in a direction along the\nstring and perpendicular to the brane and its anti\u2013brane. The linearised equation\nof small fluctuations about this background is obtained from the second variational derivative of the action which is the standard procedure and we therefore\nconsider this first (cf. also [25]). Our treatment here is somewhat different (see\nbelow) from that in refs.[25]. The resulting fluctuation equation has also been\ngiven in ref.[2].

The\nabsorption results from and takes place into the singularity of the real potential\nwhich corresponds to the black hole with zero event horizon in the analogous\n16\n\n\fcase of the dilaton\u2013axion system of e.g. ref.[19]. This absorption is a classical\nphenomenon. We therefore consider the equation\n\u25b3r \u03be + \u03c9 2\n\n\"\n\ne2\n1+ 4 \u03be =0\nr\n#\n\n(78)\n\nOne can argue that the absorption is a consequence of the nonhermiticity of the\npotential.\nThe radial part of this equation is with \u03be = r \u22121 \u03a8Ylm and angular momentum\nl\n!#\n\"\nd2 \u03a8\ne2\nl(l + 1)\n2\n(79)\n+ \u2212\n+\u03c9 1+ 4 \u03a8=0\ndr 2\nr2\nr\nThis equation is a radial Schr\u00f6dinger equation for an attractive singular potential\n\u221d r \u22124 but depends only on the single coupling parameter \u03ba = e\u03c9 2 for constant\npositive Schr\u00f6dinger energy, i.e. for S-waves the equation is with x = \u03c9r simply\n\u03ba2\nd2\n+\n1\n+\n\u03a8=0\ndx2\nx4\n!\n\n(80)\n\nIn the following we consider the general case, i.e. l 6= 0. The simplified case of\nthe singular potential replaced by an effective delta\u2013function potential has been\nconsidered in refs.[2] and [25]. The solutions and properties of such equations have\nbeen studied in detail in the literature, in both the small\u2013 and large\u2013\u03ba domains\nand with inclusion of the centrifugal term \u2212l(l+1)/r 2 in eq.(79) for the calculation\nof Regge trajectories l \u2192 \u03b1n (\u03c9 2) [26], [27],[28],[29]. A recent investigation which\nattempts to treat arbitrary power singular potentials is ref.[30]. Eq.(79) describes\nwaves above the singular potential well. With the substitutions\n1\n\n\u03a8(r) = r 2 \u03c8(r), r =\n\n\u221a\n\n1\neez , h2 = e\u03c9 2 , a = l + ,\n2\n\n(81)\n\nthe equation becomes the modified Mathieu equation\ni\nd2 \u03c8 h 2\n2\n\u03c8=0\n+\n2h\ncosh\n2z\n\u2212\na\ndz 2\n\n(82)\n\nwhich has been studied in detail in the literature [31] (though some properties,\nsuch as large\u2013h asymptotic expansions of Fourier coefficients, have even now not\nyet been published). Here we study the S\u2013matrix in the domain of finite values\nof angular momentum l and h2 6= 0, i.e. in the domain of h2 large. Relevant\nsolutions and matching conditions for this case have been developed in [32]and\n[33]. We follow the latter of these references here since this makes full use of\nthe symmetries of the solutions. Moreover we can determine also the Floquet\nexponent \u03bd which ref.[32] leaves undetermined and only remarks that the notion\nthat this is a known function of (our) a2 and h2 is \"partly a convenient fiction\".\nFor convenience we set in eq.

With the solutions as they stand, of course\n\u03c8(q, h; z) = \u03c8(\u2212q, \u2212h; \u2212z). Below we require solutions He(i) (z), i = 1, 2, 3, 4,\nwith some specific asymptotic behaviour. We define these in terms of the function\nKe(q, h; z) :=\n\nexp[i\u03c0q/4]\n\u221a\nAq (z)exp[2hi sinh z] \u2261 k(q, h)\u03c8(q, h; z)\n\u22122ih\n\n(88)\n\nSince this function differs from a solution \u03c8 by a factor k(q, h), it is still a solution\nbut not with the symmetry property \u03c8(q, h; z) = \u03c8(\u2212q, \u2212h; \u2212z). Instead, after\nperforming this cycle of replacements the function picks up a factor, i.e.\nKe(q, h; z) =\n\n\u03c0\nk(q, h)\nk(q, h)\nKe(\u2212q, \u2212h; \u2212z),\n= ei 2 (q+1)\nk(\u2212q, \u2212h)\nk(\u2212q, \u2212h)\n\n(89)\n\nin leading order. One can easily show that the quantity \u03a60 of ref. [32] is related\nto q by \u03a60 = iq\u03c0/2 + O(1/h). In Fig. 1 we show the behaviour of q as a function\nof h. In order to be able to obtain the S\u2013matrix, we have to match a solution\nvalid at z = \u2212\u221e to a combination of solutions valid at z = \u221e. This is achieved\nwith the help of Floquet solutions Me\u00b1\u03bd (z, h2 ). As such, these satisfy the same\n(1)\ncircuit relation as a solution M\u00b1\u03bd (z, h2 ) of eq.(82) expanded in a series of Bessel\nfunctions, i.e. we have the proportionality\nMe\u03bd (z, h2 ) = \u03b1\u03bd M\u03bd(1) (z, h2 ), \u03b1\u03bd (h2 ) = Me\u03bd (0, h2 )/M\u03bd(1) (0, h2 )\n18\n\n(90)\n\n\fThe functions Me\u00b1\u03bd (z, h2 ) are expansions of the modified (hence 'M' instead\nof 'm') Mathieu equation in terms of exponentials (hence 'e') which are uniformly convergent in any finite domain of z. For large values of the argument\n2h cosh z of the Bessel functions of the modified Mathieu function M\u03bd(1) (z, h2 ) can\nbe reexpressed in terms of Hankel functions. With the dominant terms of these\nwe can obtain the large 2h cosh z asymptotic behaviour of the Floquet function\nMe\u00b1\u03bd (z, h2 ), i.e. for |z| \u2192 \u221e\nMe\u00b1\u03bd (z, h2 ) \u2243 exp[\u00b1i\u03c0\u03b3/2]\n\ncos(2h cosh z \u2213 \u03bd\u03c0/2 \u2212 \u03c0/4)\n\u221a\n2h cosh z\n\n(91)\n\nwhere (with Me\u03bd (\u2212z, h2 ) = Me\u2212\u03bd (z, h2 ))\nexp[i\u03c0\u03b3] =\n\n\u03b1\u03bd (h2 )\n(1)\n= M\u2212\u03bd (0, h2 )/M\u03bd(1) (0, h2 )\n2\n\u03b1\u2212\u03bd (h )\n\n(92)\n\nWe now define the following set of solutions of eq.(82) by setting\nHe(2) (z, q, h) = Ke(q, h, z), He(1) (z, q, h) = He(2) (z, \u2212q, \u2212h),\nHe(3) (z, q, h) = He(1) (\u2212z, q, h), He(4) (z, q, h) = He(2) (\u2212z, q, h)\n\n(93)\n\nThe solutions so defined have the following asymptotic behaviour (where \u01eb(z) =\n(2h cosh z)\u22121/2 ):\nHe(1) (z, q, h)\n\n=\nr\u2192\u221e\n\n\u223c\n\nHe(2) (z, q, h)\n\n=\nr\u2192\u221e\n\n\u223c\n\nHe(3) (z, q, h)\n\n=\n\nHe(4) (z, q, h)\n\n=\nr\u21920\n\n\u223c\n\n\u03c0\n\u01eb(z) * exp[\u2212ihez \u2212 i ], Rz >> 0,\n4\nexp[\u2212i\u03c9r \u2212 i\u03c0/4]\n\u221a\n,\n\u03c9r\n\u03c0\n\u01eb(z) * exp[ihez + i ], Rz >> 0,\n4\nexp[i\u03c9r + i\u03c0/4]\n\u221a\n,\n\u03c9r\n\u03c0\n\u01eb(z) * exp[\u2212ihe| z| \u2212 i ], Rz << 0,\n4\n\u03c0\n|\n\u01eb(z) * exp[ihe z| + i ], Rz << 0,\n4\n\u03c0\n1/2\nr exp[ie\u03c9/r + i 4 ]\n,\n(e\u03c9)1/2\n\n(94)\n\nFor the following reasons we choose the latter, i.e. the solution He(4) (z, q, h), as\nour solution at r = 0.

With this identification we can write Sl\nR \u2212 R1\ni\u03c0(l+1/2)\nSl =\n,\n\u2212i\u03c0\u03bd e\n(Rei\u03c0\u03bd \u2212 e R )\n\nR \u2261 ei\u03c0\u03b3 ,\n\nwhich agrees with the S\u2013matrix of ref.[19], i.e. we thus obtained the same exact\nexpression of the S\u2013matrix here with our large\u2013h considerations. In fact, comparison with the considerations given there allows one to write down the reflection\nand transmission amplitudes Ar and At as Ar = 2i sin \u03c0\u03b3 and At = sin \u03c0\u03bd respectively. We thus have one and the same expression for the S\u2013matrix for the\ntwo asymptotic regions, i.e. in the low energy and high energy domains. One\nshould therefore be able to proceed directly to the large\u2013h case from the exact\nS\u2013matrix derived in the small\u2013h domain. This is an interesting calculation which\nwe do not attempt to go into here. We only indicate in Appendix A the first\nnecessary step in that direction, i.e. the derivation of large\u2013h asymptotic expansions for the Fourier coefficients of Mathieu functions. In this connection we\nmake the following two observations. 1) Eq.(80) is invariant under interchanges\nx \u2194 \u03ba/x, \u03a8 \u2194 \u03a8x which means that the inner or string region is equivalent\nor dual to the outer or brane region. 2) Due to the SL(2, R) invariance of the\nD3\u2013brane its action is mapped into that of an equivalent D3\u2013brane by S\u2013duality\ntransformations[35] or, in other words, weak\u2013strong duality takes the D3\u2013brane\ninto itself[3]. It would be interesting to find some connection between these\nproperties, or equivalently the symmetry which the SL(2, R) invariance of the\nD3\u2013brane action imposes on the S\u2013matrix.\nThe quantity \u03b3 is now to be determined from eq. (99). One finds\n\u001a\n\ni \u03c02 q\n\nsin \u03c0\u03b3 = sin \u03c0\u03bd \u2212 ie\n\ncos \u03c0\u03bd \u00b1\n\nq\n\n1+\n\nei\u03c0q\n\n2\n\nsin \u03c0\u03bd\n\n\u001b\n\n(102)\n\nIt remains to determine the Floquet exponent \u03bd in terms of q and h. In Appendix\nB we derive the appropriate large\u2013h behaviour of \u03bd for the case of the periodic\nMathieu equation. Replacing there the eigenvalue \u03bb by a = (l + 21 )2 and observing\nthat h2 remains h2 , the appropriate relation for our considerations is\n2\n\n1 + 3(q64h+1)\n\u03c0e4h\n1\ncos \u03c0\u03bd + 1 =\n+\nO(\n)\nq\nq\n3\n1\n(8h)q/2 \u0393[ 4 \u2212 4 ]\u0393[ 4 \u2212 4 ]\nh2\n\u0014\n\ne4h\n=\n(8h)q/2\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0010\n\n1+\n\n3(q 2 +1)\n64h\n\n\u221a\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0393( q+1\n) cos( q\u03c0\n)\n2\n2\n\n2\u03c02q/2\n\n1\n+ O( )\nh\n\n\u0015\n\n(103)\n\nSince the right hand side grows exponentially with increasing h the Floquet exponent \u03bd must have a large imaginary part. Since the right hand side is real, the\n21\n\n\freal part of \u03bd must be an integer. Using Stirling's formula we can approximate\nthe equation for q \u2243 h (i.e. irrespective of what the value of l is) as\ncos \u03c0\u03bd + 1 =\n\ns\n\nh\nh\u03c0\ncos( )(e7 /32)h/2 \u2243\n2\n2\n\ns\n\nh 1.8h\nh\u03c0\ne\ncos( )\n2\n2\n\n(104)\n\n\u00bfFrom eq.(101) and eq.(102) we obtain\nil\u03c0\n\nSl = ie\n\n\u0012\n\ncos \u03c0\u03bd \u2212\n\n\u221a\n\ncos2\n\n\u03c0\u03bd \u2212 1 \u2212\n\neiq\u03c0\n\n\u0013\n\n(105)\n\n\u00bfFrom this we obtain the absorptivity A(l, h) of the l\u2013th partial wave, i.e.\nA(l, h) := 1 \u2212 |Sl |2\n\n(106)\n\nwith near asymptotic behaviour\nA(l, h) \u2243 1 \u2212\n\n2\u03c0(16h)q\nn\n\n)\ne8h \u0393( q+1\n2\n\no2\n\n(107)\n\nIn Figs. 2, 3 and 4 we plot A(l, h) as a function of h. One can clearly see the\nexpected asymptotic approach to unity and in Fig. 2 some sign of rapidly damped\noscillations. This behaviour agrees with that obtained on general grounds in\nref.[15]. We also observe that in the high energy limit logarithmic contributions\nas in the low energy expansions, discovered originally in [16, 17, 18], and typical\nof the low energy expansions of [13] and [19], do not arise. Of course, these plots\ndo not extend down to h = 0, since our asymptotic solutions become meaningless\nin that domain. The continuation to h = 0 can be obtained, however, from small\u2013\nh expansions such as those derived in refs.[13] and [19]. Thus the absorptivity\nA(l, h) is known over the entire range of h. We observe that Sl = 0 for q =\n1, 3, 5, * * *, with [(l + 1/2)2 + 2h2 ]/2h \u2243 1, 3, 5, * * *. Only in the plot for l = 2 is h\nsufficiently large to hint at these zeros.\n\n7\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nBranes, whether fundamental or solitonic, play an important role in all aspects\nof string theory. In particular D\u2013branes have been looked at as string\u2013theory\nanalogues of solitons of simple field theories, and some of their important properties such as charges are well understood. Our first objective in the above was to\ninvestigate properties of solitonic objects of Born\u2013Infeld theory in ways familiar\nfrom field theory, in particular their classical stability. It was shown that the BIon\nand the catenoid as distinct, i.e. free objects, are stable configurations whereas\nthe brane\u2013antibrane system is unstable; we also recognised the zero modes associated with these and their significance. We then considered the D3\u2013brane of\nBorn\u2013Infeld theory and recognised this as a BPS state that preserves half of the\nnumber of supersymmetries as discussed in detail already in [2]. The equation of\n22\n\n\fsmall fluctuations about this D3\u2013brane was derived and shown to be convertible\ninto a modified Mathieu equation. The low energy solutions of this equation, the\nS\u2013matrix for scattering of a massless scalar off the brane and the corresponding\nabsorption and reflection amplitudes are similar to those for the dilaton\u2013axion\nsystem investigated first in refs.[16, 17, 18], where the important logarithmic contributions were discovered, and then investigated in extensive detail in [13] and\n[19]. Here we performed the high energy calculations which complement in particular those of [19], thus completing the investigation of the modified Mathieu\nequation for the purpose of obtaining absorption cross sections for all such cases.\nIn particular the behaviour of the important Floquet exponent involved in these\ncalculations (in general a complex quantity) is now fully understood, the Floquet\nexponent being vital in the evaluation of the S\u2013matrix which we derive and the\ncalculation of the corresponding absorption amplitudes and cross sections. According to our findings the high energy limit of the absorption cross section does\nnot involve logarithmic contributions, quite contrary to the low energy limit.\nThe high energy case considered here is not only of interest in the immediate\ncontext of the Born\u2013Infeld model considered here, but together with the low\u2013\nenergy case also of considerable interest in connection with the concept of duality\nwhich links weak coupling with strong coupling. The D3\u2013brane with Schr\u00f6dinger\npotential coupling e\u03c9 2 , which links the gauge field charge e with energy\u03c9 of the\nincoming scalar field is presumably the ideal example for the investigation of\nthis property. Investigations elucidating this aspect are of considerable interest. We also envisage interest in the study of non\u2013BPS configurations, including\nsphalerons and bounces, as a matter of principle, i.e. even if the effect of these\nis not of dominant importance. Finally we remark that it should be possible to\nproceed directly from the S\u2013matrix derived in ref.[19] to the high\u2013energy case\nhere by using appropriate asymptotic expansions for the cylindrical functions\nand expansion coefficients involved (for the latter such expansions do not seem\nto have been given in the published literature so far, but we comment on these\nin Appendix A).\n\nAcknowledgements\nD.K.P, S.T. and J.-z.

[19] on the absorptivity of the D3\u2013brane of the dilaton\u2013axion system\nit was shown that the S\u2013matrix for scattering of a massless scalar field off the\nbrane is given by\n(R \u2212 R1 )e\u2212i\u03c0l\n(A.1)\nS=\n\u2212i\u03bd\u03c0\nRei\u03bd\u03c0 \u2212 e R\n\nwhere\n\n(1)\n\nR=\n\nM\u2212\u03bd (0, h)\n(1)\n\nM\u03bd (0, h)\n\n,\n\nM\u03bd(1) (z, h) being the modified Mathieu function expanded in terms of Bessel functions, i.e.\nMe\u03bd (0, h)M\u03bd(1) (z, h) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nc\u03bd2r (h2 )J\u03bd+2r (2h cosh z)\n\nr=\u2212\u221e\n\n(an expansion with better convergence to use in practice is one in terms of products of Bessel functions as shown in ref.[19]) where Me\u03bd (z, h) is the Fourier or\nFloquet solution of the Mathieu equation. In the published literature the coefficients c\u03bd2r (h2 ) have only been considered as power series in rising powers of\nh2 , and consequently were used in ref. [19] in the small h2 or low energy domain. It would be very interesting to make the transition to the large\u2013h2 or\nhigh energy case directly from this expression by developing large\u2013h2 asymptotic\nexpansions of the Mathieu function Fourier coefficients c\u03bd2r (h2 ) (for the Bessel\nfunctions the corresponding expansions are known). We know of no publication\nwhere such expansions have been given, but one of us (M.\u2013K.) remembers from\nprivate communication with the author of ref.[37] that these Stokes\u2013type asymptotic expansions can indeed be obtained. One writes the recurrence relation of\nthe coefficients (cf. [31], p.106)\nc2\u03c1+2 + c2\u03c1\u22122 =\n\n[\u03bb \u2212 (\u03bd + 2\u03c1)2 ]\nc2\u03c1\nh2\n\n(A.2)\n\n(the Mathieu equation being y \u2032\u2032 + (\u03bb \u2212 2h2 cos 2x)y = 0). For |h2 | \u2192 \u221e this\nimplies\nc2\u03c1+2 \u221d i(2\u03c1+2)/2\nSetting\nc2\u03c1+2 \u2261 b\u03c1+1 ,\n\nb\u03c1 = i\u03c1 \u03b2\u03c1\n\nwe have\nb\u03c1+1 + b\u03c1\u22121\n\u03b2\u03c1+1 + \u03b2\u03c1\u22121\n\n[\u03bb \u2212 (\u03bd + \u03c1)2 ]\n=\nb\u03c1 ,\nh2\n\u2212i[\u03bb \u2212 (\u03bd + \u03c1)2 ]\n\u03b2\u03c1\n=\nh2\n\n(A.3)\n\n\u00bfFrom this we deduce that the next approximation to c2\u03c1+2 is obtained from\n\u0015\nr \u0014\ni X\n2\n(\u03c1 + \u03bd) \u2212 \u03bb\n\u03b2r = 1 + 2\nh \u03c1=0\n\n27\n\n(A.4)\n\n\fThe sums on the right hand side can be evaluated. E.g.\nr\nX\n\n1\n\u03c12 = 12 + 22 + 32 + * * * + r 2 = r(r + 1)(2r + 1)\n6\n\u03c1=0\nso that one obtains\n\u03b2r = 1 +\n\ni r(r + 1)(2r + 1)\nr(r \u2212 1)\n+ 2\u03bd\n+ \u03bd2 \u2212 \u03bb\n2\nh\n6\n2\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(A.5)\n\nProceeding in this way one can indeed obtain the desired asymptotic expansion\nof the coefficients c2\u03c1 . (In fact the asymptotic expansion of the Bessel function\n\u2013 similar to that of a linear combination of Hankel functions \u2013 can be obtained\nfrom its recurrence relation in a very similar way).\n\nAppendix B\nFor the determination of the large\u2013h behaviour of the Floquet exponent \u03bd we\nmake use of results of ref.[34]. A fundamental pair yI , yII of respectively even and\nodd solutions of the original periodic Mathieu equation with eigenvalue \u03bb defined\nby\nyI (\u2212z) = yI (z), yII (z) = \u2212yII (\u2212z)\n\ncan be chosen to satisfy the following boundary conditions (cf. e.g. [31], pp.99,100)\nyI (0) = 1, yII (0) = 0, yI \u2032 (0) = 0, yII \u2032 (0) = 1\n\n\u00bfFrom its original defining property the Floquet exponent \u03bd can then be shown\nto be given by (cf.

The relation (B.3) we rediscovered here has practically been unknown,\nlargely in view of the difficulty to extract it from the complicated considerations\nof ref.[36]. Our derivation above is simple and closes a difficult gap which the\nauthor of ref.[32] commented upon with the words: \"It is not likely at this stage\nthat an analytic relation will ever be found connecting (our) \u03bd and \u03b3 to (our) a2\nand h2 \".
