The\ngalaxies of FRI type are 'edge\u2013darkened' with the majority of their\nemission confined to their central regions and jets that flare out\nclose to the nucleus. On the other hand, the FRII galaxies are 'edge\u2013\nbrightened' meaning the bulk of their emission originates from the\nhotspots at the ends of their highly collimated jets. The FRII galaxies are the more luminous of the two classes and typically have\nP178MHz > 1024\u221225 WHz\u22121 sr\u22121 but there is significant overlap\nat the break luminosity. The FRIs and FRIIs have also been suggested as the unbeamed parent populations of BL Lac objects and\nflat spectrum quasars respectively (Jackson & Wall, 1999).\nThe differences between the two FR classes are not confined\nto the lobe morphology. For instance, Zirbel & Baum (1995) found\nthat the FRIIs produce 10\u201350 times more emission line luminosity\nthan the FRIs at a particular radio core power. Additionally, optical\nobservations by Owen & Laing (1989) found that the host galaxies\nof FRIs tended to be larger and more luminous than those of FRIIs,\nthough later work by Ledlow & Owen (1996) suggested that this\nresult was caused by a combination of sample selection effect, and\nonly observing a small range in radio power.\nIt is not yet clear whether the observed morphological differences between the two FR classes are the result of fundamental\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail:eer@roe.ac.uk\n\u2020 Scottish Universities Physics Alliance\n\ndifferences in the properties of the central engine (e.g. lower accretion rates in FRIs leading to advection dominated accretion flow,\nor a slower FRI black hole spin) as advocated by e.g. Baum et. al.\n(1995), or differences in the interactions of the jets with their environments as suggested by the work of Gopal\u2013Krishna & Wiita\n(2000) and Gawro\u0144ski et al. (2006). This intrinsic/extrinsic question is of vital importance for understanding the relationship between these objects; if the intrinsic difference model is correct then\nthe FRIs and FRIIs are two discrete classes of object, however if the\nevidence suggests the other model is correct, the underlying properties of the classes would be the same. In the latter case the two\nclasses may simply represent different stages in the evolution of a\nradio galaxy, i.e. it starts out as a powerful, high\u2013luminosity FRII\nand as it ages its jets become less powerful and it becomes an FRI\n(e.g. Willott et al. 2001).\nOne of the key ways in which the differences between the two\nclasses can be investigated is through their evolution with cosmic\nepoch since, if the extrinsic model is correct, then FRIs and FRIIs\nof the same luminosity should evolve in similar ways. FRIIs are\nknown to undergo strong cosmic evolution, with density enhancements for the most luminous of a factor of 100-1000 out to redshifts\nof 1\u20132, compared to a factor of \u223c10 for the less luminous, sources\n(Wall, 1980); the behaviour of the FRIs is less clear. Low\u2013redshift\nstudies initially suggested that they had a constant space density\n(e.g. Jackson & Wall 1999; Willott et al. 2001) and this appeared to\nbe confirmed at higher redshift by Clewley & Jarvis (2004). However, they selected the FRIs in their sample using a luminosity cut;\nthis could lead to FRIs being missed (particularly the more luminous FRIs which may evolve the most) since the FRI/FRII break\n\n\f2\n\nE. E. Rigby, I. A. Snellen and P. N. Best\n\nluminosity is not fixed, but is a function of host galaxy magnitude\n(Ledlow & Owen 1996). It is clear therefore, that to define a robust sample of distant FRIs, in order to obtain an accurate picture\nof their high redshift behaviour, radio morphological classification\nis a necessity.\nDetermining the cosmic evolution of FRI radio galaxies is also\nimportant because of the impact that they may have on galaxy formation and evolution. Models of galaxy formation are increasingly\nturning to these objects to solve the problem of massive galaxy\nover\u2013growth (e.g. Bower et al., 2006). It is predominantly the lower\nluminosity sources that provide the necessary feedback for this,\n(Best et al., 2006), and may possibly be limited to the FRI population alone. As such understanding the little studied FRI sources\nand their evolution could be critical to deciphering this mechanism.\nThe first significant attempt at determining the FRI high\u2013\nredshift space density was carried out by Snellen & Best (2001)\nusing the Hubble Deep Field and Flanking Fields (HDF+FF). Two\nz>1 FRI galaxies were detected in this area, which calculations\nshowed to be broadly consistent with an FRI space density enhancement comparable to that of less luminous FRII galaxies at\nthat redshift, and inconsistent (a probability of <1%) with a nonevolving FRI population. However, with only two detected FRIs\nthe uncertainties in this result are clearly large.\nThe area of sky used in the analysis of Snellen & Best (2001)\nwas only large enough to give a first estimate of the high redshift\nspace density of FRIs. This work, therefore, uses a deep, wide\u2013\nfield, Very Large Array (VLA) A\u2013array survey an order of magnitude larger than the HDF+HFF which will enable the space density to be directly measured for the first time. Here we present the\ninitial radio, optical and infra\u2013red imaging, along with the spectroscopic observations which form the basis of the work. The layout\nof the paper is as follows: in Sections 2 and 3 the sample is defined\nand the new radio observations taken are described; in Sections 4\nand 5, the optical and infra\u2013red imaging are presented and the host\ngalaxies identified; Sections 6 and 7 describe the spectroscopic observations of a subset of the sample. Finally, Section 8 outlines the\nredshift estimation methods used for the remainder of the sample\nand the conclusions of the paper can be found in Section 9.\n\n2\n\nTHE RADIO SAMPLE\n\nThe survey was split over two fields \u2013 one in the constellation of\nLynx at right ascension, \u03b1 = 8h45, declination, \u03b4 = +44.6\u25e6\n(J2000) and one in Hercules at \u03b1 = 17h20, \u03b4 = +49.9\u25e6 (J2000).\nThese fields were chosen because of the existence of previous low\nresolution radio observations by Windhorst et al. (1984), Oort &\nWindhorst (1985) and Oort & van Langevelde (1987). Additionally, the Hercules field has some previous optical and spectroscopic\nobservations by Waddington et al. (2000). Alongside this, the Lynx\nfield is also covered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York\net al. 2000; Stoughton et al. 2002).\nThe two fields were originally observed as part of the Leiden\u2013\nBerkeley Deep Survey (LBDS) in which they were referred to as\nLynx.2 and Hercules.1. For the remainder of this paper they will be\nreferred to as Lynx and Hercules respectively. It should be noted\nthat the Lynx.2 field is unusual in that it does not contain any radio\nsources brighter than 6 mJy over nearly a square degree. However,\nthe resulting underrepresentation in the radio source counts above\nthis level should not affect the conclusions of this paper, as it is the\nfaint end of the RLF that is being investigated here. This section\noutlines the previous work in the two fields.\n\n2.1 Sample definition and previous radio work\nThe LBDS survey was constructed to provide photometry for faint\ngalaxies and quasars, via multicolour plates obtained with the 4m\nMayall Telescope at Kitt Peak (Kron, 1980; Koo & Kron 1982).\nRadio follow\u2013up of nine of the LBDS fields (including Hercules\nand Lynx that are used here) was performed subsequently using the\n3km Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) at 1.4 GHz,\nat a resolution of 12.5\u2032\u2032 (Windhorst et al. 1984), reaching a rms\nnoise level, at the field centre, of 0.12\u20130.28 mJy. Their radio sample\nconsists of 306 sources which satisfied the sample selection criteria\nof peak signal to noise (SP /N ) > 5\u03c3 out to an attenuation factor,\nA(r), 6 5 (for WSRT this corresponds to a radius of 6 0.464\u25e6 or\n6 28\u2032 ).\nThe Hercules and Lynx fields were reobserved by Oort &\nvan Langevelde (1987) and Oort & Windhorst (1985) respectively,\nagain using the 3 km WSRT at 1.4 GHz with a 12.5\u2032\u2032 beam. These\ntwo sets of observations were a factor 2\u20133 deeper than the original\nWindhorst et al. (1984) ones, reaching a 5\u03c3 flux limit of 0.45 mJy\nfor Hercules and 0.30 mJy for Lynx at the pointing centre.\nThe sample used in this work is a subset of the combined Hercules and Lynx sources, as it is limited by the field of view size of\nthe optical imaging described in \u00a74; this is illustrated in Figure 1. A\nflux limit of 0.5 mJy was also imposed to remove the faintest, most\npoorly detected sources and provide a more uniform limiting flux\ndensity across the two fields. Table 1 gives the flux densities for the\nHercules field (Oort & van Langevelde 1987) and Table 2 gives the\nsame for the Lynx field (Oort & Windhorst 1985) for the sources\nincluded in this work. Table 3 gives the 1.4 GHz flux densities of\nsources which were not covered by the optical observations, but\nwere included in the subsequent infra\u2013red imaging; consequently\nthey are not part of the complete sample, but are included here\nfor completeness. These, and other source parameters, were measured by Oort and collaborators using an elliptical Gaussian fitting\nmethod in two dimensions.\n\n2.2 Sample completeness\nThe selection criteria of the LBDS meant that source weighting\nwas necessary to account for incompleteness in the starting sample. This incompleteness arises from two factors: the attenuation of\nthe WSRT primary beam and the resolution bias. The effect of the\nfirst of these factors, the decreasing sensitivity at increasing radial\ndistance from the pointing centre, is to make the probability of detecting a source depend on where it is located in the map; a source\nwhich just satisfies the selection criteria at the centre would have\nbeen missed if it was located at the map edge. To correct for this\neach source was assigned a weight that was inversely proportional\nto the area over which it would have met the selection criteria and\nhence, have been included in the sample (Windhorst et al. 1984).\nThe total sample area for the current work is limited by the size\nof the optical imaging, so the attenuation weights for the sources\nconsidered here were recalculated to account for this.\nThe corrections for the incompleteness due to the resolution\nbias (the fact that a resolved source will be more difficult to detect than a point source of the same total flux) were found, by\nWindhorst et al. (1984), through detailed modelling of the source\ndetection algorithms. It was subsequently found that sources with\nhigher flux densities were also those with a large angular size (e.g.\nWindhorst et al. 1993) which, as Windhorst, Mathis & Neuschaefer\n(1990) showed, meant that the original weights were overestimated.\nWaddington et al. (2000) derived a new expression for the resolu-\n\n\fA sample of mJy radio sources at 1.4 GHz in the Lynx and Hercules fields\n\n3\n\nFigure 1. The distribution of the radio sources in the Lynx and Hercules fields; the labels correspond to the last 3 characters of the\nsource names. The large circle in both plots represents the 0.464\u25e6 radius of the previous WSRT observations of e.g. Windhorst et al.\n(1984); this is also approximately the 30\u2032 primary beam of the VLA at 1.4 GHz. The dotted line represents the area of the sample which\nis defined by the field of view of the optical imaging. Dots indicate the positions of the additional sources which were not included in\nthe sample because they either fell below the flux density limit of 0.5 mJy, or they are not covered by the sample area. Open diamonds\nindicate sources not included in the complete sample, but which were included in the infra\u2013red observations.\n\ntion bias that took this into account; it is that method which is used\nin the current calculations.\nThese two re\u2013derived correction factors, the attenuation\nweight and resolution weight, were then multiplied together to give\nthe final weights. For further details of the source weighting methods used in the LBDS see Windhorst et al. (1984) and Waddington\net al. (2000). See Tables 1 and 2 for the weight calculated for each\nsource.\n\n3\n\nNEW RADIO OBSERVATIONS\n\n3.1 The observations\nThe VLA data were taken with the array in A configuration on 22nd\nApril 2002 for the Hercules field, and 15th February 2002 for the\nLynx field. Both sets of observations were taken at a frequency of\n1.4 GHz (L\u2013band), in four IF spectral line mode to enable wide field\nimaging, using 16 channels of width 781.25 kHz. The IFs were\ncentred on 1391.3 and 1471.1 MHz observing dual polarization.\nBoth the Hercules and the Lynx fields were observed for 8.5 hours\neach.\nThe data were calibrated using the NRAO AIPS package. Because of the non-coplanar geometry of the telescope array, in order\nto image the entire area of the primary beam, a three\u2013dimensional\nFourier transform is required. As this would be computationally\nimpractical, the standard pseudo\u2013three\u2013dimensional Fourier transform technique, as incorporated in the task IMAGR, (Perley 1999)\nwas adopted: this technique divides the field of view into numerous smaller facets, within each of which a two\u2013dimensional Fourier\ntransform provides a sufficiently good approximation. For each of\nthe Hercules and Lynx fields, 256 by 256 pixel facets (with 0.35\u2032\u2032\nper pixel) were centred on all the sources that were already known\nfrom the imaging of Windhorst, Oort and collaborators, discussed\nabove. These sub-fields were cleaned and self-calibrated using the\nAIPS tasks IMAGR and CALIB. The self calibration consisted of\nmultiple phase\u2013only cycles followed by one final amplitude and\nphase calibration. The resulting maps have a resolution of 1.6\u2032\u2032 and\nreach a noise limit of 15 \u03bcJy.\n\n3.2 Source detection and flux density measurement\nThe Hercules sources of Oort & van Langevelde (1987) and Lynx\nsources of Oort & Windhorst (1985) were all detected in our VLA\nobservations. This gives a sample of 81 sources, evenly spread over\nthe two fields; the distribution on the sky can be seen in Figure 1.\nFlux densities were measured for these sources using the AIPS task\nimfit to fit a Gaussian, if they were pointlike, or the task tvstat to\nsum within a defined area, if they showed significant extension;\nthe method used for each individual source is indicated in Tables\n1 and 2. The values were then corrected for the attenuation of the\nVLA primary beam. For some objects, where previously one source\nwas detected, these higher resolution observations have resolved\nit into more than one component each associated with a different\nhost galaxy. In these cases, the sub\u2013components are labelled a, b,\netc. and the low resolution flux density has been assigned to each\nnew component according to the A\u2013array flux density ratio. These\ncomponents are only retained in the sample if they remain above\nthe 0.5 mJy flux density limit.\nFigure 2 shows a comparison between the WSRT flux densities measured by Oort et al. (1985; Lynx field) or Oort & van\nLangevelde (1987; Hercules field) and those measured for the\nnew VLA A\u2013array observations. The values are generally in good\nagreement for the compact sources; those that are different have\nSOort > S1.4GHz which suggests that flux has been lost at the\nhigher VLA resolution, and possibly indicates a resolved out FRI\u2013\ntype structure. The extended sources, however, are mainly underestimated by Oort et al. (SOort < S1.4GHz ) as a result of their elliptical Gaussian measuring method which misses any extended flux. It\nshould be noted that a subset of the two fields (36% of the sample)\nwere also observed with the VLA by Oort et al. (1987). These measurements have not been used for flux density comparisons though,\ndue to the small number of sources included.\nThe positions of the detected sources are given in Tables 1 and\n2 along with the measured flux densities and primary beam correction factors, CPB , (i.e. SCor = CPB SMeas ) used. The corresponding radio contour images can be found in Appendix B.\n\n\f4\n\nE. E. Rigby, I. A. Snellen and P. N. Best\nTable 1.

To obtain all of these spectroscopically would have been very time consuming, so the aim\nwas to combine photometric redshift estimates with spectroscopic\nfollow\u2013up of the best high redshift FRI candidates. Optical observations were carried out using the Wide Field Camera (WFC) on\nthe 2.5 m Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) in La Palma, and a subsample of sources were also observed using the UKIRT Fast Track\nImager (UFTI) on UKIRT, the 3.8 m UK Infra\u2013red Telescope located in Hawaii. These two sets of observations are described in\nthis section.\n\n4.1 INT observations and data reduction\nThe WFC consists of 4 thinned EEV 2kx4k CCDs with a pixel size\nof 13.5 \u03bcm, resulting in a scale of 0.33\u2032\u2032 /pixel and a combined field\nof view of \u223c 34 \u00d7 34 arcmin2 . This large field of view makes the\nWFC an ideal instrument for observing the two fields which are of\ncomparable size.\nThe main WFC observations were split over two separate\nruns in April 2003 and April 2004. Unfortunately these were both\nlargely weathered out, so observations through two filters only were\nobtained - sloan r\u2032 and i\u2032 . Several exposures of 300s or 600s were\ntaken, and the telescope was offset by 30\u2032\u2032 after every third observation to fill the gaps between the CCDs and cover the whole field.\nFull details of the observations can be found in Table 4.\nThe April 2003 run took data on one night only; the 7th. Conditions were non-photometric, so these data have only been used to\ndetermine optical identifications for the radio objects.

For the April 2004 observations this astrometric calibration was only applied to the r\u2013band data, as it was felt that no\nfurther radio host\u2013galaxy identifications would be obtained from\nconsidering the significantly shallower i\u2013band data also. However,\nthe i\u2013band images were tweaked locally to each r\u2013band detection to\nensure that the images lined up. The calculated errors were \u223c 0.3\u2032\u2032\nfor all CCDs in both fields.\n\n4.2 UKIRT observations and data reduction\n\nFigure 2. A comparison of the VLA A\u2013array (S1.4GHz ) and Oort et al.\n(1985) or Oort & van Langevelde (1987) (SOort ) flux densities for both\nfields. Extended, tvstat measured sources are shown as triangles and compact, imfit measured sources are shown as diamonds.\n\n2004 run useful observations were only taken on the 15th. Standard\nstar fields were observed throughout the photometric night.\nOne further observation of the Lynx field of 300s, in i\u2032 , was\nobtained on 6th January 2005. This was needed because of the lack\nof photometric i\u2013band data in this field. Although the night was\nphotometric the seeing was very poor (\u223c 3\u2032\u2032 ). Standard star fields\nwere again observed throughout the night. This image was only\nused to photometrically calibrate the Lynx field; the identifications\nwere done with the previous r and i\u2013band images.\nAll the images were processed using the IRAF software package. Bias frames, taken at the beginning of each night, were averaged together to make a master\u2013bias for each detector which was\nthen subtracted from the remaining data. For the majority of the observations, a flat\u2013field was made for the four detectors, in each field\nand filter, by median combining the separate science frames and rejecting pixels according to the readnoise and gain of the CCD. The\nexception to this was the 15th April observations where twilight\nflats were taken. Next the individual science frames were divided\nby the corresponding sky\u2013flat, which had been normalised using its\npixel mean. The frames were registered using \u223c10 stars and shifted\nand the final images were then median combined and clipped using the CCD noise properties as before. The offsets between frames\nwere sufficiently small that it was not necessary to account for distortions in this process.\nThe astrometric calibration for the INT data was complicated\nby the distortion of the WFC across the 4 CCDs (Taylor, 2000). To\ncorrect for this the USNO1 B1.0 catalogue (Monet et al. 2003) was\n\n1\n\nUnited States Naval Observatory\n\nIn contrast, UFTI consists of one 1024x1024 HgCdTe array with a\nplate scale of 0.091\u2032\u2032 /pixel. This results in a field of view of 92\u2032\u2032\nwhich is significantly smaller than that of the WFC. This meant\nthat it could only be used to obtain images of, mainly, individual\nsources rather than the complete\u2013field observations done with the\nINT.\nThe UKIRT UFTI observations were done in a combination\nof service and visitor mode, spread over the period July 2004 to\nJanuary 2005. All the observations were done using the K\u2013band\nfilter; details of the observations, along with the sources observed\ncan be found in Table 5. The sources selected for these observations\nwere those with a faint optical detection or no optical detection at\nall.\nThe sources were observed using a 9\u2013point dither pattern, with\noffsets of 10\u2032\u2032 , and an exposure time of 60s per dither position. In\ngeneral this was repeated 4 times resulting in a total of 36 exposures. The exceptions to this were 53w054, where the observation\nhad to be re\u2013started due to high humidity and 55w125, where software problems meant the observation had to be halted after 27 exposures (3 repeats of the dither pattern). Also, because some observations were done in service, two sources which were not detected\nafter 36 exposures were able to be re\u2013observed for a further 18 exposures at a later date. The observations of 55w128 and 55w132\nwere also repeated since the originals were taken at a very high airmass which resulted in significant elongation of the objects in the\nfield.\nAppropriate standard stars (FS125 for Lynx and FS27 for Hercules) were observed multiple times throughout the night if multiple targets were also observed, but only observed once on other\nnights. All nights were photometric.\nThe infra\u2013red data reduction method is similar to that already\ndescribed for the optical data; again the IRAF software was used\nto process the images, but each individual source observation was\nreduced independently. The first step was the subtraction of the appropriate dark frame from each image. Flat\u2013fields were then made\nfor each source by median combining the first 9 observations only,\nrejecting pixels according to the noise properties of the detector, to\n\n\fA sample of mJy radio sources at 1.4 GHz in the Lynx and Hercules fields\nTable 6.

The images were then divided by the flat\u2013field which had\nbeen normalised using its median pixel value.\nThe final steps in the reduction process \u2013 sky\u2013subtraction, cosmic ray removal and image combining \u2013 were done using the IRAF\npackage dimsum, by P. Eisenhardt, M. Dickinson and S.A. Stanford, and, in particular, the task reduce. The images were again\nregistered using, on average, 10 stars. For the source with 2 separate observations (55w133) the sky\u2013subtraction was done for the\ntwo nights separately, but all the images were then registered and\ncombined together to produce a single final image.\nThe astrometric calibrations for the images were done where\npossible using the INT images as references. In cases with no INT\noverlap, rough astrometry was derived from the telescope pointing\nposition and then the RA and DEC positions were improved using\nthe one or two stars from the USNO catalogue available in the small\nfields.\n\n4.3 Aperture photometry and source identification\nThis section outlines the steps taken to identify the host galaxies of\nthe sample sources and the subsequent magnitude measurements of\nthese objects.\n\n4.3.1 Optical standard star calibration\nThe standard star observations were reduced in the same way as the\nscience observations. The fields used were from the Landolt Faint\nEquatorial Standards catalogue (Landolt, 1992), each containing\n\nDate\n\nFilter\n\n\u03ba (mag/airmass)\n\nmzpt\n\nApril 2004\n\ni\nr\n\n-0.03\n-0.07\n\n24.24 \u00b1 0.05\n24.68 \u00b1 0.05\n\nJanuary 2005\n\ni\n\n-0.01\n\n24.31 \u00b1 0.05\n\nan average of 10 standard stars. The April 2004 standard field was\nSA104 in r\u2013band only and SA107 in r and i, whereas the January\n2005 standard fields were SA104 and SA98. The April 2003 observations were not photometric. Object counts were measured using\na 5\u2032\u2032 radius aperture for all standards using the gaia package; the\nonly exception to this was for the January 2005 standards where\nhigh seeing meant a larger aperture (15\u2032\u2032 radius) was needed, and\nstars with near neighbours were ignored to minimise errors.\nThe Landolt Faint Equatorial Standards are only available in\nthe Johnson\u2013Kron\u2013Cousins photometric system, and are given in\nVega magnitudes. Therefore the apparent magnitudes for the Landolt standard stars needed to be transformed to the Sloan photometric system. This transformation was done using the following two\nrelations from Smith et al., (2002):\nr \u2032 = V \u2212 0.84(V \u2212 R) + 0.13\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nr \u2212 i = 1.00(R \u2212 I) \u2212 0.21\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nIn the above equations lowercase letters indicate the Sloan photometric system and uppercase letters the Johnson system. It should\nbe noted that this also transforms the magnitudes to the AB\u2013\nmagnitude system.\nOnce the transformations had been applied, the calibration coefficients, zeropoint magnitude, mzpt , and extinction co\u2013efficient,\n\u03ba, were determined for the photometry. These are summarised in\nTable 6 and are in good agreement with previously published values for INT extinction.\n\n4.3.2 Infra\u2013red standard star calibration\nThe UKIRT standard star observations were reduced in a similar\nway to the science images, the one difference being that all 5 observations for each standard were used to make the flat\u2013field image.\nIn contrast to the INT Landolt standard star fields, which contained\nmany stars, only one star was used for Hercules (FS27) and one for\nLynx (FS125). These were both from the UKIRT Faint JHK Standards catalogue and are given in Vega magnitudes (Casali, 1992).\nThe aperture size used to measure the standards was 2.5\u2032\u2032 radius.\nAs there is only one star per field and, in many cases, just one\nstandard star observation per night, the zeropoint magnitude and\nextinction co\u2013efficient could not both be determined. The extinction co\u2013efficient, \u03ba, was therefore taken to be 0.05 mags/airmass,\nthe published value for UFTI (Leggett, 2005). The zeropoint magnitudes for each observing night were then calculated using the\npublished mapp for each standard; the values found all lay in the\nrange 22.35\u201322.40 and are in good agreement with previous values\ngiven for UKIRT. For nights where more than one source and hence\nmore than one standard, were observed the mean value for mzpt\nwas used; the uncertainty of \u00b10.02 on this zeropoint was incorporated into the error estimates of the source magnitudes as described\nin \u00a74.3.5.\n\n\f8\n\nE.

Best\n\n4.3.3 Identifications and magnitudes\nThe source host\u2013galaxy positions were found by overlaying the\nVLA A\u2013array radio contour maps with the optical and infra\u2013red\ndata. Figures B1 and B2 show the radio/optical and, where appropriate, radio/infra\u2013red overlays resulting from the UKIRT and INT\nApril 2004 observations. Radio contour maps for sources with no\nhost galaxy identification are shown in Figure 3. The corresponding\nhost galaxy positions are given in Tables 8 and 9.\nThe aperture photometry of all the sources was then done,\nagain using the gaia package. The counts received for each source\nin r, i, and K\u2013band (if available), were measured in 4 different sized\napertures \u2013 1.5\u2032\u2032 , 2.5\u2032\u2032 , 4.0\u2032\u2032 and 8.0\u2032\u2032 radius \u2013 and then, depending on the extent of the source, the measurement from the most\nappropriate aperture was selected and used thereafter. The aperture\nchosen for each source was the same in the three bands to enable\ncolours to be accurately determined. Sky\u2013subtraction was achieved\neither using an annulus round the object or, in cases where this\ncould not be done because of the proximity of other objects, using\na sky\u2013aperture placed nearby.\nThe magnitudes were then calibrated using the appropriate\nvalues of \u03ba and mzpt determined for the optical and infra\u2013red standard stars; these can be found in Tables 8 and 9 and are in reasonable agreement with previously published results. The K\u2013band\nmagnitudes for sources observed with UKIRT but not included in\nthe complete sample are given in Table 7.\n4.3.4\n\nAperture corrections\n\nThe next step was to correct all the calculated source apparent magnitudes to a metric aperture of 63.9 kpc diameter, thus allowing accurate comparisons to be made between sources at all redshifts. The\n63.9 kpc aperture, corresponding to an aperture of \u223c8\u2032\u2032 at z = 1 has\nbecome a standard metric size following previous work by Eales et\nal. (1997) and others.\nAt low redshift (z < 0.6) this correction is carried out using the curve of growth for elliptical galaxies tabulated by Sandage\n(1972); this method assumes that the hosts of radio galaxies are all\ngiant ellipticals and that they share the same intensity profile. This\nassumption is a good approximation at low redshift, but is not valid\nfor higher redshift radio galaxies which can exhibit very different\nstructure. For radio galaxies located at z > 0.6 therefore the measured emission within an aperture of radius r was assumed to be\nproportional to r \u03b1 where \u03b1 = 0.35 (Eales et al., 1997).\nThese aperture correction methods obviously depend on the\nredshifts for the sources being known; only a small fraction of the\nsample satisfied this condition. For the remaining objects redshifts\nwere estimated iteratively using the K\u2013z and r\u2013z relations, as described in \u00a78. The calculated magnitude corrections for the r, i and\nK\u2013band magnitudes can be found in Tables 8 and 9. The aperture\ncorrections range from +0.15 to -0.52 magnitudes and are typically negative, with an average correction of -0.3 mag to account\nfor missing flux.\n4.3.5 Magnitude error\nThe magnitude error was determined by combining in quadrature\nfour potential sources of error: (i) the error on the received counts as\ndetermined by Poisson error on the incoming photons, (ii) the error\nin the determination of mzpt , (iii) the error due to the subtraction of\nthe sky background, found by taking the standard deviation of 10\napertures placed randomly on empty regions in the fields and (iv)\n\nTable 7.

These\nnumbers rose to 76% and 87% with the inclusion of the optical\ndata from April 2004. 80% of the Hercules sources observed in\nthe infra\u2013red were identified, compared with 57% of the sources\nobserved in the Lynx field. Combining these figures gave an identification fraction for the Lynx field of 83%, and 90% for Hercules.\nIn total, out of the complete sample, 4 radio sources in the Hercules field and 7 radio sources in the Lynx field remain unidentified\nafter the r\u2032 , i\u2032 and K\u2013band observations. The observations reached\noptical 3\u03c3 limiting magnitudes of r \u2032 < 25.17 mag and i\u2032 < 23.76\nmag for Hercules, and r \u2032 < 24.38 mag and i\u2032 < 23.46 mag for\nLynx; the infra\u2013red 3\u03c3 limiting magnitudes were K < 19.85 mag,\nK < 19.98 mag and K < 20.16 mag for the 36x60s, 54x60s and\n72x60s observations respectively. Notes on individual sources can\nbe found in Appendix A1.\n5.1 Colours and magnitude distribution\nThe (r \u2212 i) and (r \u2212 K) colour\u2013magnitude diagrams for both Lynx\nand Hercules sources are shown in Figure 3. The (r \u2212 i) plot suggests a slightly greater range in the colours of the sources in the\nLynx field compared to the Hercules field, but this is likely to be\nthe result of the relative shallowness of the Lynx i\u2013band data, which\nwould introduce a bias against the fainter bluer sources in this field,\nrather than a result of the aforementioned radio source count underrepresentation. The (r \u2212 i) colours for both fields though show that\nthe majority of the sources are hosted by red galaxies as expected.\nThe Lynx field sources in the (r \u2212 K) plot have a similar\ncolour distribution to the Hercules sources, but the small number\nof sources in this diagram make a comparison difficult. The small\nnumbers and poor population are the result of the selection criteria used for the K\u2013band observations; sources with either an undetected or faint r\u2013band detection were those chosen.\nAlso shown on Figure are two likely models for an L\u2217 type\ngalaxy (assuming Mi\u2217 = \u221222.0 (Blanton et al., 2001)), calculated\nusing the GALAXEV code (Bruzual & Charlot 2003): passive evolution following an initial burst of star formation at z = 5, and\nexponentially declining star formation, with an e\u2013folding time of 1\nGyr, beginning at z = 10. The (r \u2212 i) vs i model lines track the\ndata well out to i\u223c20 (corresponding to z \u223c 0.6), beyond which\n\n\fA sample of mJy radio sources at 1.4 GHz in the Lynx and Hercules fields\n\n9\n\nTable 8.

be bluer than the models. This tendency is not unexpected as the blue rest\u2013frame wavelengths probed\nat those redshifts mean that a smaller amount of recent star formation or AGN activity will significantly bluen the galaxy colours. In\nthe (r \u2212 K) plot, the observed galaxies are in good agreement with\nthe models, but again the small number of sources included make\ndrawing conclusions difficult.\n\ngrams are also in reasonable agreement with those shown in Figures\n9 and 10 respectively of Waddington et al. (2000).\n\nThe magnitude distribution histograms (Figure 4) are useful\nas they provide a first look at the redshift distribution of the sample\nthrough the magnitude\u2013redshift relations for radio galaxies (these\nare described in more detail in \u00a78.1), which indicate that the optically faintest objects should lie at the largest distances. The K\u2013band\nmagnitude distribution is ignored here because the low number of\nK\u2013magnitudes taken would not result in a meaningful diagram.\n\nThe redshifts for the radio sources identified in the Lynx and Hercules fields are vital in determining their cosmic evolution. Previously published spectroscopic or photometric redshifts (Waddington et al. 2000 and references therein; Bershady et al. 1994) already\nexist for 19 of the Hercules field sources, and 3 of the Lynx field\nsources had spectroscopic redshifts from the SDSS; the remaining\nsources had no previous redshift information.

RESolution,\nconsists of one Loral back\u2013illuminated and thinned 2048x2048\npixel CCD, with a scale of 0.275\u2032\u2032 /pixel, resulting in a field of\nview of 9.4\u2032 x 9.4\u2032 . For multi\u2013object spectroscopy (MOS) observations, rectangular masks with dimensions 6.0\u2032 x 7.7\u2032 , are used. Vertical slits of constant width (either 1.1\u2032\u2032 or 1.6\u2032\u2032 ) but varying length\nare drilled in the masks according to the positions of the various\nsources for which spectra are required.\n\nThe DOLORES observations took place from 18th to 20th\nApril 2004. All nights were photometric and the standard star Feige\n34 was observed (with a 5\u2032\u2032 longslit) at regular intervals. Each mask\nobservation consisted of several long exposures to avoid saturation of the CCD, and to allow cosmic ray hits to be identified in\nthe final spectra. The good weather conditions also allowed two\nobservations with the 1.5\u2032\u2032 longslit of three sources (two in Hercules and one in Lynx), which were not included on the masks. All\nobservations were carried out using the LR-R grism which has a\nwavelength range of 4470\u201310360\u00c5 and a resolution of 11.0\u00c5. Full\ndetails of the observations can found in Table 11.\n\nSince some uncertainties in the astrometry remained the 1.6\u2032\u2032\nslit was used for the observations. Only 10 masks were permitted\nper observing run, so it was decided to create 5 masks of varying\nposition angle for each for the two fields, thus covering as many\n\nThe masks for the Lynx field were, on average, observed for\n\n\fA sample of mJy radio sources at 1.4 GHz in the Lynx and Hercules fields\n\n11\n\nFigure 3.

The shaded regions show the undetected\nsources at the magnitude limits.\n\nless time than those for Hercules due to the early setting time of the\nLynx field.\n\n6.1 MOS Mask Creation\nThe mask limitations meant that not all the radio sources could be\nincluded in the observations, therefore a ranking system was introduced to ensure that the optimum number of interesting, high\u2013\nredshift, sources were included. First, r\u2013band magnitudes were estimated for all the sources using a rough mzpt and ignoring the\nairmass and extinction corrections. (These magnitudes could only\nbe estimated as, at the time these observations were being prepared,\nonly the non\u2013photometric April 2003 WFC data were available.)\nThe resulting magnitudes were then used to give an indication\nof the redshifts of the sources through the r\u2013z relation (Snellen et al.\n1996). Those sources with previously published redshifts were obviously excluded from the rankings. Table 10 gives the full details\nof the ranking scheme.\nThe masks were then arranged such that the maximum number of first rank sources would be observed. This was done using\nan IDL script which allowed possible combinations of objects to\n\nTable 10. The ranking scheme for the radio sources.\nRedshift\n\nr magnitude\n\nRank\n\nz>0.5\n\n21-22\n>22\n\n1\n2\n\nz<0.5\n\n<21\n<15\n\n3\n4\n\nbe rotated to determine the best fit parameters for each mask. Table\n11 gives the final determined parameters. In the Lynx field 56% of\nall the sources were included, and of these 30% were first rank and\n78% were second rank or above. The Hercules field was slightly\nbetter with 62% of the total number included; 80% classed as second rank or higher and 11% first rank.\n\n6.2 Data reduction\nThe initial data reduction of the DOLORES observations was very\nsimilar to the WFC reduction process; again the IRAF software\n\n\f12\n\nE.

First a master bias was constructed\nfor each night by averaging all the appropriate bias frames together;\nthis was then subtracted from the rest of the exposures. The science,\nflat\u2013field and arc data were then grouped according to mask. The\ncalibration arc\u2013lamp used was HeNeAr.\nThe science and arc images for each mask were then combined\nand split into individual two\u2013dimensional spectra for each source.\nThe normalised flat field for each source was then applied and the\nstrong background sky\u2013lines were removed. This process was not\nperfect and some background residuals remained; these had to be\ntaken into account when attempting to identify spectral features.\nOne\u2013dimensional spectra were then extracted for the sources\nand their corresponding arcs. Lines in the arc spectrum were then\nidentified and the resulting calibration was applied to the science\nspectra. The calibration was improved by adding sky\u2013lines ([OI]\nat 6300.3\u00c5 and 5579\u00c5 and Na at 5896\u00c5), extracted from the un\u2013\nbackground subtracted science spectra, to the arc spectra to improve the wavelength coverage.\nThe spectra were then flux calibrated using observations of a\nstandard star, Feige 34. The standard star spectrum was also used\nto correct, to a first approximation, for sky absorption features.\n\n6.3 Spectroscopic Results\nThe spectroscopic observations included 41 sources in total; 17 in\nthe Hercules field and 24 in the Lynx field. The resulting spectra yielded 3 and 11 definite redshifts in the Hercules and Lynx\nfields respectively. A single line was detected in a further 4 spectra\nin Lynx and 2 in Hercules; this mainly provided a redshift 'best\u2013\nguess' only, except where the line identification was obvious (e.g.\nbroad MgII). 65% of the redshifts were from emission lines and\nthe remainder were from absorption lines only. These results are\ngiven more fully in Table 13 and the spectra for sources with one\nor more detected lines or absorption features, are shown in Figure\nC1. The list of sources observed with DOLORES, but for which no\nlines were detected can be found in Table 12. Notes on individual\nsources can be found in Appendix A2.\n\n7\n\nCLEANING THE SAMPLE: IDENTIFYING QUASARS\nAND STARBURST GALAXIES\n\nNot all the radio sources detected in the two fields will be radio\ngalaxies; some contamination of the sample by quasars and starburst galaxies is inevitable. The quasars need to be identified as\n\nTable 12.

The radio luminosity function of Best et al. (2005) shows that, in general, the radio\npower of these galaxies is lower than that of AGN and that it is only\nat these very low radio powers (\u223c 1023 WHz\u22121 ) that their number\ndensity dominates; this suggests that only low\u2013power sources need\nto be considered here. There were 16 radio sources in the sample\nwhich have Prad 6 1024 WHz\u22121 and were therefore possible\nstarburst galaxy candidates.\nThe main way to distinguish between radio and starburst\ngalaxies is through examination of the emission line ratios of their\nspectra. Kauffmann et al. (2003) classify a source as an AGN if\nlog(f [OIII]/f (H\u03b2)) >\n\n0.61\n+ 1.3. (3)\nlog(f [NII]/f (H\u03b1)) \u2212 0.05\n\nwhere f [OIII], f (H\u03b2), f [NII] and f (H\u03b1) are the fluxes of the\nrespective emission lines; [OIII] (5007\u00c5), [NII] (6583\u00c5), H\u03b2\n(4861\u00c5) and H\u03b1 (6563\u00c5). This classification method obviously\nrequires a source to have spectroscopic data with the right lines\ndetected. Of the 16 candidates, 11 have DOLORES spectra but\nnone have all four of the necessary emission lines. However, 3 candidates (66w027, 55w137 and 60w039) have both [NII] and H\u03b1\ndetected and one, 55w150, has both [OIII] and H\u03b2, hence an indication of their classifications is possible; the results of this are\n\n\fA sample of mJy radio sources at 1.4 GHz in the Lynx and Hercules fields\nTable 13.

E. Rigby, I. A. Snellen and P. N. Best\n\noutlined below. The fluxes for these lines can be found in Table\n13. A further two candidates, 55w135 and 60w084, were included\nin the spectroscopic observations of the SDSS. The resulting spectrum for 55w135 clearly shows it to be a starburst galaxy since\nf (H\u03b1) \u226b f [NII] and f (H\u03b2) \u226b f [OIII] whereas the spectrum\nfor 60w084 suggests that it is an AGN since f (H\u03b1) \u223c f [NII] and\nf [OIII] \u226b f (H\u03b2).\n\u2022 66w027\n(z=0.086,\nP1.4GHz =1022.00 WHz\u22121 )\n\u2013\nlog(f [NII]/f (H\u03b1)) = \u22120.38 for this source which suggests that\nit is a starburst galaxy but is not sufficient to be unambiguous.\nHowever, the H\u03b2 line was also detected whilst the [OIII] line was\nnot, implying that log(f [OIII]/f (H\u03b2)) < 0.0 and that this source\nis a starburst galaxy.\n\u2022 55w137\n(z=0.151,\nP1.4GHz =1022.97 WHz\u22121 )\n\u2013\nlog(f [NII]/f (H\u03b1)) = 0.05 for this source which places it\nfirmly in the AGN region. This is further supported by the\nindication of extended radio emission visible in the radio image.\n\u2022 60w039\n(z=0.151,\nP1.4GHz =1022.58 WHz\u22121 )\n\u2013\nlog(f [NII]/f (H\u03b1)) = \u22120.65 for this source which places\nit firmly in the starburst region.\n\u2022 55w150\n(z=0.470,\nP1.4GHz =1023.86 WHz\u22121 )\n\u2013\nlog(f [OIII]/f (H\u03b2)) = 0.78 for this source which, coupled\nwith the high radio power, strongly suggests that it is an AGN.\nThe five remaining starburst candidates with spectra can be\nclassified by comparing their f ([OII]) and radio fluxes. Best et al.\n(2002) derive a rough relationship between these two fluxes for\nstarburst galaxies by equating the theoretical correlation between\nmean star\u2013formation rate and [OII] luminosity (Barbaro & Poggianti, 1997) with that for radio (Condon & Yin, 1990) giving\nS1.4GHz\nf [OII]\n= 11.0 \u221216\n(1 + z)\u22120.8\n\u03bcJy\n10\nergs\u22121 cm\u22122\n\n(4)\n\nwhere S1.4GHz is the radio flux of the object in question at a frequency of 1.4 GHz and z is the redshift. It should be noted that dust\nextinction can cause the measurement of the star\u2013formation, from\nthe [OIII] flux, to be underestimated.\nThe radio\u2013[OII] flux relationship for AGN is an extrapolation\nof the results of Willott et al. (1999) for powerful radio galaxies to\nthe sub\u2013mJy levels of these sources. This gives, after converting to\n1.4 GHz (assuming a spectral index of 0.8),\nf [OII]\nS1.4GHz\n= 4.7 \u00d7 104\n\u03bcJy\n10\u221216 ergs\u22121 cm\u22122\n\n\u0010\n\n\u00111.45\n\n(5)\n\nIt should be noted however, that AGN show considerable scatter\naround this line.\nEquations 4 and 5 are shown in Figure 5. Overplotted are the\n[OII] and radio fluxes for 60w055 and 60w024. The remaining 3\nsources (60w016, 55w160 and 55w157) lack an [OII] detection so\nan upper limit for their [OII] flux is plotted instead. It is clear from\ninspection of this diagram that all these sources lie well below the\nstarburst region, suggesting that they are AGN. This is in accordance with their radio powers, all of which are > 1023.3 WHz\u22121 .\nThis leaves 5 candidates still to be classified. Two (66w009b\nand 55w127) have radio powers that are 6 1023.01 WHz\u22121 which\nstrongly suggests that these are also starburst galaxies. The final\nthree candidate sources (55w118, 55w122 and 55w161) all have\n23\n\u22121\nP >\n\u223c 10 WHz which is comparable with the powers of candidates already identified as AGN. Therefore, on the balance of probability, these three objects are classified as AGN also.\nIn summary, therefore, there are five starburst galaxies which\n\nFigure 5.

The dotted line shows the effect of two\nmagnitudes of dust extinction in the measurement of the star formation rate.\nOverplotted are the starburst candidate sources for classification.\n\nneed to be removed from the sample: 66w027, 66w009b, 55w127,\n55w135 and 60w039.\n\n7.2 Identifying quasars\nPossible quasars in the sample were identified in three ways; firstly\non the basis of their point\u2013like appearance (determined by measuring the FWHM using gaia) in the r\u2013band images, secondly by\nlooking for broad lines (\u226b1000kms\u22121 ) in the available spectra and\nthirdly by examining their optical (r \u2212 i) colours. The quasar candidates selected in this way are described below.\n\u2022 53w061 \u2013 This source has a pointlike appearance (FWHM of\n1.53\u2032\u2032 in r\u2013band, c.f. seeing of 1.5\u2032\u2032 ) and a blue (r \u2212 i) colour of\n0.36. It is also classed as a likely quasar (Q?) by Kron et al. (1985)\non the basis of its colour. It was included in the DOLORES observations but no continuum was detected. It is therefore classed as a\nquasar here.\n\u2022 53w065 \u2013 This source has a blue (r \u2212 i) colour of -0.31 but\nWaddington et al. (2001) classify it as a galaxy on the basis of the\nnarrow lines seen in its spectrum.\n\u2022 53w075 \u2013 This source is classified as a quasar by Kron et al.\n(1985) on the basis of its spectrum; this is supported by its pointlike\nappearance.\n\u2022 53w080 \u2013 This source is classified as a quasar by Kron et al.\n(1985) on the basis of its spectrum; this is supported by its pointlike\nappearance.\n\u2022 55w121 \u2013 This source is classified as a quasar by Kron et al.\n(1985) on the basis of its colour. However, whilst its non\u2013detection\nin i does suggest a blue colour, this is not supported by its, not very\nblue, (r \u2212 K) of 3.8, and it does not appear to be pointlike. It is\ntherefore classed as a galaxy here.\n\u2022 55w124 \u2013 This source is classified as a quasar on the basis of\nits very broad MgII line and blue (r \u2212 i) colour of -0.06.\n\u2022 55w140 \u2013 This source is classified as a quasar on the basis of\nits very broad MgII line and very blue (r \u2212 i) colour of -0.21.\n\n\fA sample of mJy radio sources at 1.4 GHz in the Lynx and Hercules fields\n\n15\n\nIn summary, therefore, the objects classed as quasars in the\nsample are 53w061, 53w075, 53w080, 55w124 and 55w140.\n\n8\n\nREDSHIFT ESTIMATION AND RESULTS\n\nRedshifts have now been determined for 44% of sources in the\nLynx field and 62% of sources in the Hercules field, either through\nthe observations described above or with previously published results. For the remainder, estimated redshifts were calculated instead\nusing the two different magnitude\u2013redshift relations, K\u2013z and r\u2013z,\noutlined in \u00a78.1 below. The K\u2013z relation, the more accurate of the\ntwo, was used for all sources detected in the UKIRT observations;\nthe remaining sources were estimated with the r\u2013z.\n\n8.1\n\nThe K\u2013z and r\u2013z magnitude\u2013redshift relationships\n\nThe K\u2013z relation is a tight correlation between the K\u2013band magnitudes and redshifts of radio source host galaxies; it exists because\nthe radio host galaxy population is made of up of passively evolving, massive elliptical galaxies.\nAt high redshift the relation is slightly different for the radio\nsurveys of different flux density limits (Willott et al. 2003), which\ntherefore implies that it is dependent on the flux density of the radio\nsource. The relation used here is that found for the 7C survey as\nthe source fluxes for that sample are the best comparison to those\nconsidered here. The relation itself is given by Willott et al. (2003)\nas,\nK = 17.37 + 4.53 log z \u2212 0.31(log z)2 .\n\n(6)\n\nThe majority of the sources with a host galaxy detection but\nwithout redshifts, were also not included in the UKIRT observations so, therefore, the K\u2013z relation outlined above cannot be used\nfor them. Instead, since all these sources have an r\u2013band magnitude, the r\u2013z relation was used. This relation describes a correlation\nbetween the redshift and r\u2013band magnitude of the host galaxies\nof Gigahertz Peaked Spectrum (GPS) radio sources (Snellen et al.,\n1996).\nIn general, redshifts estimated using the r\u2013z relation are not as\nreliable as those found using the K\u2013z, especially above z \u223c 0.6\nwhere the r\u2013band samples shortward of the 4000\u00c5 break. At these\nbluer wavelengths, factors such as star formation or, in more powerful radio galaxies, the 'alignment effect' (where the optical structures of the galaxy align with the radio jets (e.g. McCarthy et al.,\n1987)) can result in considerable scatter in the measured magnitudes. GPS sources are less affected by this scatter (c.f. Figure 6\nof Snellen et al. 1996) so are ideal for the redshift estimation here.\nThe GPS relation is\nrg = 22.7 + 7.4 log z.\n\n(7)\n\nand is valid up to z \u223c 1; at higher redshifts it is unreliable due to\nthe scarcity of measurements and the blue rest\u2013frame wavelength\nrange it is sampling.\nThe relation given in Equation 7 above assumes that the r\u2013\nband magnitude used was observed using the Thuan\u2013Gunn filter\nsystem. It therefore had to be transformed to the Sloan filter system, via the Johnson filter system, before it could be used. In the\nfollowing description capital letters indicate the Johnson system,\nlower\u2013case letters indicate the Sloan system and g subscripts indicate the Thuan\u2013Gunn system. To convert from Johnson to Thuan\u2013\nGunn, Jorgensen et al. (1994) give:\n\nFigure 6. A comparison of the different methods used to obtain redshifts.\nFilled diamonds indicate the comparison between the two redshift estimation methods whilst empty diamonds and triangles indicate the comparison\nbetween the spectroscopically determined redshifts and the r\u2013z and K\u2013z\nestimates respectively. Square outlines indicate redshifts that came from\nsingle\u2013line spectra. The dotted lines are the 1\u03c3 values of the spectroscopic\n\u2206z, \u00b10.15.\n\nrg = R + 0.111(gg \u2212 rg ) + 0.317,\n\n(8)\n\nwhilst to convert from Johnson to Sloan, Equation 1 from Smith et\nal. (2002) gives:\nr \u2032 = R + 0.16(V \u2212 R) + 0.13.\n\n(9)\n\nMaking the assumption that (V \u2212 R) \u2243 (gg \u2212 rg ) \u2243 1 for radio\ngalaxy hosts, then r = rg \u2212 0.14 and the r\u2013z relation becomes\nr \u2032 = 22.56 + 7.4 log z.\n\n(10)\n\nThe magnitude\u2013redshift relations need aperture corrected\nmagnitudes to give reasonable results, but the estimated redshift is\nneeded to perform the aperture correction (as described in \u00a74.3.4).\nTo solve this problem an IDL script was written to iterate the redshift estimates and subsequent aperture corrections until they converged on a final value.\nTable 14 summarises all the redshift information for the\nsources in the two fields. The quoted redshift for each source is ideally a spectroscopic or previously published one, if neither of those\nis available then the redshift is one from a K\u2013z estimation and finally, for sources with no K\u2013magnitude or spectrum, the redshift\ngiven is an r\u2013z estimate.\n8.2 Redshift comparison\nA valuable test of the redshift estimation comes from comparing the\nestimates with the DOLORES MOS and the previously published\n(Waddington et al. 2000; 2001) spectroscopic and photometric redshifts. The results of this comparison for both r\u2013z and K\u2013z redshift\nestimates are shown in Figure 6; in general the agreement between\nthe spectroscopic and estimated results is very good with a 1\u03c3 \u2206z\nof 0.15. The agreement is also reasonably good for the photometric\nredshifts.\nAdditionally, several of the sources in the sample have both\nr and K\u2013band magnitudes, thus providing a useful means of comparing the two methods of redshift estimation. The solid diamonds\nplotted in Figure 6 show the difference in the two estimates ((K\u2013z)(r\u2013z)) plotted against the K\u2013z value. The two relations give similar\nredshifts up to zkz \u223c1.5, but, for the redshifts higher than this, the\n\n\f16\n\nE. E. Rigby, I. A. Snellen and P. N. Best\n\nTable 14.

The redshift distribution for sources in the Hercules (a) and Lynx\n(b) fields subdivided to show the contribution from the different redshift\nmethods.\n\nfor the Lynx field, especially at the high end, compared to the Hercules field. Whilst many of the Lynx sources were included in the\nDOLORES MOS observations, lines in the resulting spectra tended\nto be detected in the brighter, lower redshift objects. The high\u2013z\nend of both fields, however, is populated mainly by sources with\nless accurate redshift estimates.\n\n9 CONCLUSIONS\nK\u2013z value is much greater than the r\u2013z further suggesting the lower\naccuracy of the r\u2013z relation at these values.\n8.3\n\nThe redshift distribution of the sample\n\nNow that redshift information has been obtained or estimated for a\nlarge proportion of the objects in the two fields, redshift histograms\ncan be constructed to compare the radio source distributions for the\ntwo fields; these are shown, split into the different redshift methods,\nin Figures 7(a) and 7(b). Both histograms, peak at redshifts before\nz = 1.0.\nThese histograms also illustrate the lack of definite redshifts\n\nIn summary, the data presented here form a complete sample of\n81 radio sources above the limiting flux density of S1.4GHz > 0.5\nmJy. Of these, only 12 remain unidentified after the optical and\ninfra\u2013red observations. Redshifts either previously existed or have\nbeen determined for 49% of the sample; the remaining objects with\na host galaxy detection, have redshift estimates.\nThe radio, optical, infra\u2013red and MOS observations outlined\nhere define a multi\u2013wavelength sample which will form the basis for investigations into the high\u2013redshift space density and subsequent cosmic evolution, if any, of FRI radio galaxies. Paper II\nwill describe the high\u2013resolution radio observations and subsequent morphologically classification of the sources in the sample,\n\n\fA sample of mJy radio sources at 1.4 GHz in the Lynx and Hercules fields\nalong with the subsequent space density measurements of the detected FRIs.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nEER acknowledges a research studentship from the UK Particle\nPhysics and Astronomy Research Council.

(1984) classified these\ntwo sources as radio galaxy lobes but, in agreement with Waddington et al. (2000), optical identifications were found for both sources\nindicating they are two separate radio galaxies. However, the\nWaddington et al. identification of 53w054b seems incorrect \u2013 a\nfaint source is detected in the K\u2013band which is more closely associated with the radio position.\n53w087 and 55w132 \u2013 Neither of these sources were detected in\nthe optical or infra\u2013red imaging and, as a result, are quoted as being at z >4\n\u223c in Table 14. However, inspection of their radio maps\nshows that both appear to be extended, diffuse\u2013like sources, which\nsuggests that they are more likely to be dusty star\u2013bursting galaxies, or post\u2013mergers, at z = 1\u20134. Their estimated redshift limits\nmay, therefore, be unreliable.\n\n\f18\n\nE. E. Rigby, I. A. Snellen and P. N. Best\n\n66w042 \u2013 Whilst the centre of this source does not appear to align\nwith the indicated optical galaxy, the identification is valid as the\nfaint radio core is offset to the west.\n55w133, and 55w143a/b \u2013 The r\u2013band magnitudes measured for\nthese 3 sources are all around the 1\u03c3 level. They therefore should\nbe treated as unreliable.\n55w137 and 60w032 \u2013 The slightly different telescope pointing\nused in the 2004 INT observations, compared to that used in 2003,\nmeant that these sources were not present on the 2004 images.\n55w159b \u2013 The magnitude measured for this source should be\ntreated as less reliable due to the presence of two other objects in\nclose proximity to it.\nA2 Spectroscopy source notes\n53w070 \u2013 The single broad line is identified as MgII, giving a redshift of 1.32.\n53w086b \u2013 The 4000\u00c5 break can be seen in this spectrum but no\nlines are convincingly detected. The redshift of 0.73 is consistent\nwith the r\u2013band magnitude estimate of 0.81.\n53w089 \u2013 Waddington et al. (2000) detect [OII] and [OIII] for this\nsource, giving a redshift of 0.635 but nothing is detected in these\n(shallower) observations.\n66w031 \u2013 The identification of single strong line as [OII] at a redshift of 0.81 is consistent with the redshift estimated from the r\u2013\nband magnitude (0.97).\n66w036 \u2013 No line data are quoted for the G\u2013band absorption line\nfor this source as the negative extent of the flux density suggests\nthat it is contaminated by noise.\n55w124 \u2013 The single broad line is identified as MgII, giving a redshift of 1.34.\n55w128 \u2013 The weakly detected single line is identified as [OII],\ngiving a redshift of 1.19, but this is uncertain.\n55w131 \u2013 The single line is identified as [OII] giving a redshift of\n1.12, which is consistent with the redshift of 1.15 estimated using\nthe r\u2013z relation.\n55w140b \u2013 The redshift of 1.68 is from a single, broad line, identified as MgII.\n60w039 \u2013 The two observations of this source on masks L3 and L4\nhave been combined together with the scomb task in iraf.\n\nAPPENDIX B: THE RADIO/OPTICAL IMAGES\nAPPENDIX C: THE SPECTRA\nHere Figure C1 shows the spectra resulting from the DOLORES\nMOS observations.\n\nFigure B1.
