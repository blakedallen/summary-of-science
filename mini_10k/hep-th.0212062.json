The twin pillars of modern physics,\nnamely, 1). General Relativity, in which the dynamics of the classical continuum of space-time is coupled to the dynamics of the matter moving within it\nand 2). Quantum Field Theory, with rules of quantization to be applied, in\nprinciple, to all degrees of freedom including gravity, are found to be incompatible. While supersymmetric superstring theory has provided new insights,\nit is as yet far from being a convincing physical theory with predictable and\nexperimentally verifiable consequences.\nBoth general relativity and quantum field theories assume that space-time\nis a continuum. A pseudo-Riemannian manifold, based on such a continuum\npicture, provides the basis for the geometrical description of the general theory of relativity. Likewise, quantum fields and their interactions are local\noperators that are functions of continuous, space-time coordinates. If one\nwants to explore the possibility of a unified quantum theory of space, time\nand matter, it appears that such a continuous space-time is inadequate. Recent ideas based both on string theory and approaches to quantum gravity\nsuggest strongly that space-time structure at the Planck scale may be discrete with noncommutative coordinates. The continuum space-time of classical physics, it is hoped, will emerge in certain limiting regimes, just as the\nclassical behavior of quantum systems emerges in an appropriate limit.\nAt the present time we do not have a precisely defined noncommutative\nspace that meets the above requirements. However, in recent years, Connes\nhas proposed an alternate approach to the study of the structure of spacetime, based on noncommutative geometry (NCG) [1, 2]1 . It has given rise\nto the description of the Standard Model with a geometrical interpretation\nof the Higgs field on the same footing as the gauge field [6, 7]. Spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking follows as a natural consequence. It enables one, in\nprinciple, to calculate some arbitrary parameters of the Standard Model,\nsuch as the Weinberg angle, the top quark and Higgs masses [8, 9, 10].\nConnes' mathematical framework is general enough to explore also the\ncharacter of noncommutative spaces at the energy scales that go beyond the\n1\n\nsee also [3, 4, 5] for a review\n\n2\n\n\felectro-weak scale. In this framework, Connes bypasses the precise specification of the manifold as the starting point. Instead, he formulates its\ndescription in terms of an associative and involutive algebra, commutative\nor noncommutative. One may think of this as a generalization of the wellknown theorem due to Gelfand [1, 11], which states that the classical topological space based on a continuum can be completely recovered from the\nabelian algebra of smooth functions. We shall discuss Connes' ideas in some\ndetail later in this paper, but we note here that his noncommutative geometry begins with what is called a spectral triple consisting of i) an involutive\nalgebra A of operators, commutative or noncommutative, ii) a Hilbert space\nH as the carrier space for a representation of generalized differential forms\nconstructed from this algebra, and iii) a self-adjoint operator D, called the\nDirac operator, acting on A. The algebra, A, replaces and generalizes the\ncommutative algebra of smooth functions. The Dirac operator D allows one\nto build a differential structure associated with any associative algebra and\ndefines the metric.\nAlthough the action functionals, in principle, can be constructed using\nthe metric structure encoded in the Dirac operator, the procedure is still not\nunique. It allows different approaches to different problems. Thus, while the\nDiximier trace is used successfully to construct the action functional for the\ngauge sector of the Standard Model, other approaches have been pursued in\nthe literature in dealing with the gravitational interactions. The Wodzicki\nresidue,for instance, is proposed to be used as an action functional for the\ngravity sector in the two-sheeted space-time. It leads to the conventional\nEinstein-Hilbert action supplemented by a term proportional to the square\nof a scalar field [12, 13]. The vector field that is part of the generalized metric\nis cancelled completely in the final action. The scalar field without a kinetic\nterm does not propagate and causes problems when coupled to matter fields.\nThe Diximier trace is used in other approaches with different generalizations\nof the Cartan formalism leading to a Brans-Dicke field coupled to gravity\n[14, 15]. In these approaches, the vector field vanishes as a consequence of\na reality condition or a consistency condition. In a more recent paper [16],\nConnes and Chamseddine have proposed a new universal spectral action\nprinciple governing a noncommutative space that gives rise to the EinsteinHilbert action together with higher order terms.\nLandi, Viet and Wali [17] have adopted still another approach. It follows\nclosely the standard Riemanian geometry and generalizes it in the case of a\n3\n\n\ftwo-sheeted space-time that represents a discretized version of Kaluza-Klein\ntheory in which, the fifth compact circular dimension is replaced by two discrete points. By formulating the basic notions of the conventional geometry\nin terms of algebraic forms, they define the latter in such a way that they\nmake sense both in the case of commutative and noncommutative situations.\nIn their simplified version of the model in which the generalized metric is\nassumed to be the same on the two sheets,the resulting action functional\nis exactly that of the zero mode sector of the Kaluza-Klein theory. In the\nmore general case studied by Viet and Wali [18, 19], the Cartan formalism of\npseudo-Riemannian geometry finds its generalization to allow the most general metric that contains pairs of tensor, vector and scalar fields. All of these\nfields are present in the resulting action functional with a set of constraints\non the non-vanishing torsion that generalizes the torsion free condition in the\nstandard space-time. They find a finite spectrum of the discretized KaluzaKlein theory without requiring the truncation of the infinite mass spectrum.\nIn the special case [19], when the torsion free condition is imposed, the spectrum reduces to the zero mode sector coupled to dilatons with a sixth order\npotential and a cosmological constant [19]. Recently, Viet [20] has found a\nnew minimal set of constraints, which together with the Cartan equations\ndetermine the connection, torsion and curvature in terms of the pairs of tensor, vector and scalar fields with a simpler Einstein-Hilbert-Cartan action\nfunctional.\nIn this paper, we extend our formalism to include a fermionic and its\nassociated gauge boson sectors. As a prelude to the study of the Standard\nModel to include gravity, we consider a model of a left- and a right- chiral\nfield living on a curved two-sheeted space-time and construct their action\nfunctionals. Due to the existence of different metric fields on the two sheets of\nspace-time, we find a possible mechanism in our formalism for parity violation\ndue to gravity.\nIn Section 2, we present the basic elements of the noncommutative differential geometry after a review of the algebraic approach to the standard\ndifferential geometry. This is primarily to set the stage for the contrasting\nNCG approach. The formulas of the key geometric notions in the standard\ncase are formulated in such a way that they can be used as guidelines for generalizations in the noncommutative situation. In the Section 3., continuing\nthe same approach, we introduce metric structure and construct Riemannian geometry using the algebraic approach and generalize it to the case of\n4\n\n\fnoncommutative geometry \u00e0 la Connes. We also discuss in this section the\nrepresentation mapping \u03c0 given by Connes [1] to represent operators in a\ngiven Hilbert space. This procedure will be important in the realization of\na noncommutative geometric model in the rest of the paper. In Section 4.,\nwe specialize to the algebra of differential forms and metric structure on the\ntwo-sheeted space-time. Here we follow the minimal constraints given in [20]\nto construct the Einstein-Hilbert-Cartan action. By following closely, the formulas given in Section 3, we establish a concrete realization of the abstract\nnoncommutative geometry \u00e0 la Connes in our formalism. In Section 5., we\ndiscuss the physical contents of the gravity sector in two-sheeted space-time.\nIn Section 6., we construct the action for the gauge and chiral fermion sectors. Section 7. is devoted to discussions of some physical consequences of\nthe model, and the final section is devoted to a summary and conclusions.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nAlgebraic approach to differential geometry\nGlobal and algebraic approaches versus local construction\n\nThe traditional starting point of the standard differential geometry is the\nlocal construction of the vector spaces of tangent vectors and differential\nforms in the coordinate bases at an arbitrary local point x \u2208 M [21, 22,\n23, 24]. In this construction, the differential forms are formulated as duals\nto the tangent vectors, which are derivatives of the functions at a point\nx. The differential forms form a vector space. All the geometric notions\nsuch as metric, connection, torsion, curvature and physical fields as scalars,\nvectors, tensors can be formulated conveniently in terms of differential forms.\nAlthough these notions can be defined locally, their meaning can only be\nunderstood clearly in the context of a global construction [24].\nThe physical fields that are defined at all points of a manifold M, should\nbe formulated strictly as the sections in a global framework of fiber bundles.\nIn particular, the spinors are meaningful if and only if a global property of the\nmanifold M, the orientability, can be defined. The physical fields, which are\ndefined as sections of the fiber bundles with M as the base manifold, have an\n5\n\n\falgebraic finite projective module structure. The connection together with\nother concepts such as the covariant derivative and the curvature can also be\ndefined in the framework of this global construction [24]. This observation\nis important as it paves the way to a pure algebraic approach that allows\ndirect generalization of the ordinary geometry to NCG without reference to\nthe concept of a point.\nThe concept of a point as the starting point is the main obstacle to\ngo beyond the standard geometry and seek a unified framework of general\nrelativity and quantum theory. In an algebraic approach, on the other hand,\nit is possible to start from the pure algebraic structures to formulate the basic\ngeometric elements. Thus, the Gelfand's theorem [11], which so far has been\njust an alternative formulation of differential geometry, becomes the central\npoint in such an algebraic approach to geometry without the concept of a\npoint.\nA discussion of the global approach could provide a great deal of useful\ninsight because it can serve as a bridge between the traditional and algebraic\nconstructions. However, such a task is beyond the scope of this paper. 2\nHowever, from the algebraic relations that are originally derived from a local\nconstruction of the ordinary geometry, the basic geometric and physical elements can be formulated in such a way that they can be generalized directly\nto NCG. In the following Sections, it is our goal to reformulate the basic\nnotions of the ordinary geometry in the algebraic approach first, and then\ndirectly generalize them to the non-commutative case.\n\n2.2\n\nThe ordinary differential geometry\n\nThe essential point of an algebraic approach is taking the algebra of function as a starting point. The set of differential forms will be considered as an\nalgebraic module, a concept more general than that of a vector space, which\nalso makes sense when the algebra is noncommutative.\nThe continuous functions f (x) : M \u2212\u2192 R form a commutative algebra C \u221e (M).According to Gelfand's theorem, all the information about the\nmanifold M is encoded in this algebra. In other words, knowing the algebra\nC \u221e (M) is equivalent to knowing the manifold M in the ordinary differential\ngeometry.\n2\n\nThe interested readers are referred to [24] for more details in physical applications.\n\n6\n\n\fThe graded algebra of differential forms is then constructed with the help\nof a differential operator d that maps the function f as a 0-form to the 1-form\ndf . The module of 1-forms is extended by including all the elements df.g,\nwhere g is an arbitrary element of C \u221e (M). The higher forms can be defined\nby extending the differential operator d as the mapping from n-forms onto\nn + 1-forms.\nThe operator d is required to satisfy the following properties: i) d2 = 0,\nii) d(ab) = da.b + (\u22121)n a.db, where a is a n-form and b is an arbitrary form\n(Leibnitz rule), iii) d is hermitian.\nIn general, the differential operator can be given as any operator that\nsatisfies the above three properties. In the particular case of ordinary differential geometry, the differential operator d is given in a finite basis of the\n1-forms dx\u03bc (\u03bc = 0, 1, ..., n),\nd = dx\u03bc \u2202\u03bc .\n\n(2.1)\n\nThe assumption about the existence of a finite basis of a module of 1-forms\nis essential in the non-commutative case.\nThe action of d on a function f as a c-number operator is given as follows\ndf = [d, f ] = dx\u03bc \u2202\u03bc f (x).\n\n(2.2)\n\nAn arbitrary 1-form u is also generated by the elements dx\u03bc\nu = dx\u03bc u\u03bc ,\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere u\u03bc are contained in C \u221e (M).\nThe action of d on u in accordance with the properties i)-iii) is\ndu = d(dx\u03bc u\u03bc ) = d(dx\u03bc ).u\u03bc \u2212 dx\u03bc dx\u03bd \u2202\u03bd u\u03bc = \u2212dx\u03bc dx\u03bd \u2202\u03bd u\u03bc .\n\n(2.4)\n\nWe can write du as a combination of an antisymmetric and a symmetric\n2-forms,\n1\n1\ndu = (dx\u03bc dx\u03bd \u2212 dx\u03bd dx\u03bc )(\u2202\u03bc u\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd u\u03bc ) \u2212 (dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + dx\u03bd dx\u03bc )(\u2202\u03bc u\u03bd + \u2202\u03bd u\u03bc ).\n4\n4\n(2.5)\nThe symmetric 1-forms must be dropped since they lead to the so called\"junk\nforms\". In a specific representation, a non-zero form can be derived from a\n7\n\n\fform which is identical to zero. Junk forms are such forms. As an example,\nconsider the form df.f \u2212 f.df that is identical to zero; however its differential d(df.f \u2212 f.df ) = \u2212df.df \u2212 df.df = \u22122df.df is not zero, if the symmetric\nform is allowed. The algebra of anti-symmetric 1-forms is a closed algebra\nby itself.\nThere are various ways to avoid junk forms. The simplest way, however,\nis to replace an ordinary product by the wedge product\n1\ndx\u03bc \u2227 dx\u03bd = (dx\u03bc dx\u03bd \u2212 dx\u03bd dx\u03bc ).\n(2.6)\n2\nThe Eqn.(2.6) can be generalized directly for the wedge product of an\narbitrary number of the elements dx\u03bc just by anti-symmetrization.\nA n-form \u03c9 is a purely antisymmetric tensor of the following form\n\u03c9 = dx\u03bc1 \u2227 ... \u2227 dx\u03bcn \u03c9\u03bc1 ...\u03bcn .\n\n(2.7)\n\nThe n-forms form a vector space \u03a9nx (M). The wedge product is defined\nbetween a m-form \u03c91 and a n-form \u03c92 to form a m + n-form \u03c91 \u2227 \u03c92 as an\nanti-symmetrized tensor product\nm+n\n\u2227 : \u03a9nx (M) \u00d7 \u03a9m\n(M).\nx (M) \u2212\u2192 \u03a9x\n\n(2.8)\n\nb = dx\u03bc b\u03bc ,\n\n(2.9)\n\nOne can define the graded algebra of the differential forms as \u03a9x (M) =\nn\nn \u03a9x (M).\nAs an example of differential forms, a Lie-algebra valued gauge field belonging to a group G or gauge connection b ,can be given as the 1-form\nL\n\nwith its field strength as the 2-form\n1\nf = db + b \u2227 b = dx\u03bc \u2227 dx\u03bd f\u03bc\u03bd = dx\u03bc \u2227 dx\u03bd [(\u2202\u03bc b\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd b\u03bc ) + [b\u03bc , b\u03bd ]]. (2.10)\n2\nIn a \"semi-classical\" limit, all the forms are defined as operators on a\nHilbert space H of spinor wave functions. The strict geometric formulation\nof the physical spinor fields is given as spinor bundles. On the Hilbert space\nH, we can construct a \u03b3- matrix representation by identifying the abstract\nelement dx\u03bc as\ndx\u03bc \u2261 \u03b3 \u03bc ,\n(2.11)\n8\n\n\fwhere \u03b3 \u03bc are the usual Dirac matrices.\nIn the \u03b3-matrix representation, the differential operator d is represented\nby the Dirac operator\nd = \u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc .\n(2.12)\nThe gauge field one-form and the field strength two-form are represented\nrespectively by\nb = \u03b3 \u03bc b\u03bc ,\n(2.13)\nand\nf = \u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd f\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(2.14)\n\nwhere \u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd = 21 [\u03b3 \u03bc , \u03b3 \u03bd ].\nRiemannian geometry can be constructed, in accordance with the Equivalence Principle, by introducing a locally flat orthonormal basis \u03b3 a , a =\n0, 1, 2, 3 and introducing a vierbein structure, which gives the transformation between the two frames\n\u03b3\u03bc\n\u03b3a\nea\u03bc e\u03bcb\nea\u03bc e\u03bda\n\n= e\u03bca \u03b3 a\n= ea\u03bc \u03b3 \u03bc\n= \u03b4ba\n= \u03b4\u03bd\u03bc\n\n(2.15)\n\nGravity can be introduced via the connection 1-forms\n\u03c9ab = \u03b3 c \u03c9abc .\n\n(2.16)\n\nTwo main notions that characterize the gravity structure in space-time,\nthe torsion and curvature, can be defined by the Cartan's structure equations.\nThe torsion 1-forms ta are given in the first structure equation\nta = d\u03b3 a \u2212 \u03b3 b \u2227 \u03c9ba\n\n(2.17)\n\nr ab = d\u03c9ab + \u03c9 ac \u2227 \u03c9 cb ,\n\n(2.18)\n\nThe curvature 2-forms r ab given by the second structure equation\n\ndetermines the scalar curvature completely in terms of connections.\n\n9\n\n\f2.3\n\nNon-commutative differential geometry and the\nspectral triple\n\nIn the case of non-commutative geometry, we shall follow the same steps\nas outlined in Sect 2.2. We will begin with Connes' spectral triple [1, 2],\nwhich consists of : 1) An involutive, unital algebra of functions A, 2) Hilbert\nspace H, and 3) Dirac operator \u03b4 that satisfies the properties i)-iii)in Sect.2.2.\nThe existence of a finite basis for the module of differential forms is understood. Also, the algebra A of generalized functions is not necessarily\ncommutative as in the conventional case. In this subsection, we shall begin\nwith a brief review of Connes' abstract construction of universal enveloping\nalgebra of the noncommutative differential forms.\nThe universal differential enveloping algebra constructed from a noncommutative algebra A is the differential algebra \u03a9\u2217 (A), generated by all a, b \u2208 A\nand a symbol \u03b4, such that\n\u03b4(1) = 0,\n\u03b4(ab) = (\u03b4a)b + a(\u03b4b).\n\n(2.19)\n\nBy definition, the algebra of 0-forms \u03a90 (A) \u2261 A; \u03b4a belongs to the space\nof universal 1-forms \u03a91 (A), whose general element \u03c9 is a linear combination\n\u03c9=\n\nX\n\n\u03b4ai bi ,\n\ni\n\nai , bi \u2208 A.\n\n(2.20)\n\nThe existence of a finite number of elements \u03b4ai is guaranteed by a generalization of the vector space to the finite projective module. More details\nabout this concept can be found in [1, 3]. However, here we just remark that\nin the ordinary geometry there is also a finite number of elements dx\u03bc which\nare the particular forms of \u03b4ai .\nIn a vector space, scalar multiplication of a vector is defined with elements\nof an algebraic field, usually that of the complex or real numbers. The direct\ngeneralization of a vector space of 1-forms is an A-module, where the linear\ncombinations with real or complex coefficients are replaced by the elements\nof A and the scalar multiplication is defined with elements of the algebra A\nfrom right\n\u03c9b = (\n\nX\ni\n\n\u03b4ai bi )b =\n\nX\ni\n\n10\n\n\u03b4ai (bi b),\n\n\u2200b \u2208 A.\n\n(2.21)\n\n\fThe Leibnitzian property of \u03b4, Eqn.(2.19), can be used to express left\nmultiplication of \u03c9 by an element b \u2208 A,\nb\u03c9 = b( i \u03b4ai bi )\nP\n=\ni \u03b4(bai )bi \u2212 \u03b4bai bi ,\nP\n\n\u2200ai , bi , b \u2208 A.\n\n(2.22)\n\nThat is to say, the generalized 1-forms give rise to an A-bimodule structure. Here, for the sake of definiteness, we have used the basis with \u03b4ai on the\nleft. However, it is always possible to use the Leibnitz rule (2.19) to rewrite\na differential form with the right basis. Due to the non-commutativity of\nthe algebra A, the basis elements and the expansion coefficients in the right\nbasis are not necessarily the same as in the left one as in the commutative\ncase.\nTo proceed further,we note that we can multiply two 1-forms as in the\ncommutative case. The associativity of the algebra A and Eqn.(2.19) imply\n(\u03b4b0 a0 )(\u03b4b1 a1 ) = \u03b4b0 (a0 \u03b4b1 )a1 = \u03b4b0 \u03b4(a0 b1 )a1 \u2212 \u03b4b0 \u03b4a0 (b1 a1 ).\n\n(2.23)\n\nContinuing in this manner, we can write p-fold products of 1-forms, Acoefficient linear combinations of which give the algebra \u03a9p (A). A general\nelement of \u03a9p A is of the form\nX\n\n\u03b4a1i ...\u03b4api bi ,\n\ni\n\naki , bi \u2208 A.\n\n(2.24)\n\nThe algebra \u03a9p (A) is now a right A-module being a generalization of the\nvector space of p-forms on a manifold. Clearly, by applying repeatedly\nEqn.(2.22), one may define the product of a universal p-form with a q-form\n\u03a9p A \u00d7 \u03a9q A 7\u2192 \u03a9p+q A.\n\n(2.25)\n\nHence, the space of universal forms has the structure of a graded algeL\nbra, the universal algebra \u03a9\u2217 (A) \u2261 p \u03a9p A. The involution on A extends\nuniquely to an involution on the algebra \u03a9\u2217 A when we impose the condition\n(\u03b4a)\u2217 \u2261 \u2212\u03b4a\u2217\n\n(2.26)\n\nTo transform the graded algebra of forms \u03a9\u2217 A into a differential algebra,\nwe consider the differential \u03b4 as a linear operator that takes\n\u03a9p \u2212\u2192 \u03a9p+1\n11\n\n(2.27)\n\n\fby defining\n\u03b4(\u03b4a1 ...\u03b4ap b) \u2261 (\u22121)p \u03b4a1 ...\u03b4ap \u03b4b.\n\n(2.28)\n\nEqn.(2.28) implies two basic relations,\n\u03b4 2 \u03b1 = 0,\n\n\u2200\u03b1 \u2208 \u03a9\u2217 A,\n\n\u03b4(\u03b11 \u03b12 ) = (\u03b4\u03b11 )\u03b12 + (\u22121)deg\u03b11 \u03b11 \u03b4\u03b12 ,\n\n(2.29)\n\u2200\u03b1j \u2208 \u03a9\u2217 A.\n\n(2.30)\n\nThus, all the constructions of the A-module of differential forms are in exact\nparallel with the standard approach. In the next section, we shall present\nthe general procedure to realize the above abstract construction in a given\nHilbert space. We note that in the module of the generalized differential\nforms, the \"junk\" forms must be eliminated to guarantee that if \u03b4\u03c9 6= 0 the\ndifferential form \u03c9 must be a non-zero form.\n\n2.4\n\nRepresentation of the differential algebra on a\ngiven Hilbert space\n\nThe general constructions described in Sect 2.3 need to be realized by\noperators acting on appropriate Hilbert spaces in different applications. The\noperator representation of the differential forms is a direct generalization of\nthe \u03b3- matrix representation given in Sect. 2.2.\nConnes [1, 2, 3] has given a general procedure to construct representations\nby the following graded homomorphism that preserves the involution,\n\u03c0 : \u03a9\u2217 A \u2212\u2192 L(H),\n\u03c0p (\u03b4a1 ...\u03b4ap b) =\n\np\nY\n\n[D, \u03c00 (ai )]\u03c00 (b),\n\n(2.31)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere L(H) denotes the space of bounded operators on H and \u03c00 , the representation of A on H. The operator \u03b4 is represented by a self-adjoint operator\nD, the Dirac operator, on the Hilbert space H, with compact resolvent, such\nthat the commutator [D, a] is a bounded operator, \u2200a \u2208 A.\nIn essence, differential forms, in the sense of Connes, are the images of\nuniversal forms under \u03c0. Strictly, however, a problem arises in the definition\n12\n\n\fof these operator-valued forms, in that there exist universal forms \u03b1 such\nthat \u03c0(\u03b1) = 0, but \u03c0(\u03b4\u03b1) 6= 0. Once one mods out by these troublesome\nforms for each p, we obtain the space of operator-valued forms \u03a9pD (A), the\nanalog of \u03a9p (A). This is the problem of elimination of the \"junk\" forms in\nordinary geometry. In two-sheeted space-time, as it will be shown in Sect.\n4, this elimination can be done by a generalized wedge product in perfect\nparallelism with the conventional approach.\nThe various definitions proceed as in the previous subsection. We define\n\u03a9\u2217D (A) \u2261\n\nM\n\n\u03a9pD (A)\n\n(2.32)\n\nConsider Eqn.(2.20)as a specific case to illustrate the representation given\nin Eqn.(2.31). The arbitrary 1-form \u03c9 can be represented as an operator U\non the Hilbert space H as follows\nU = \u03c01 (\u03c9) = \u03c01 (\u03b4ai )\u03c00 (bi ) = \u0398i Ui ,\n\n(2.33)\n\nwhere \u0398i are just the representations of the element \u03b4ai in Eqn.(2.20). Thus,in\nthis general context, the basis of differential forms is given without reference\nto a point. To be more specific with the Dirac operator D, let F be an operator representing a generalized function w in \u03a90D (A) \u2261 A. From Eqn.(2.31)\nit follows that\nDF = [D, \u03c00 (w)] = \u03c01 (\u03b4w) = \u03c01 (\u03b4ai wi )\n=\n\u03c01 (\u03b4ai )\u03c00 (wi ) = \u0398i (DF )i .\n\n(2.34)\n\nThe coefficients (DF )i \u2208 A can now be regarded as derivatives but not\nreferring to a specific point. Formally, we can define the operator Di as\n(DF )i \u2261 Di F = [Di , F ].\n\n(2.35)\n\nHence, we can represent the Dirac operator in the \u0398i basis in the form\nD = \u0398 M DM .\n\n(2.36)\n\nFrom now on we use the latin upper case indices M, N = 0, ..., n \u2212 1 to\nreplace the latin lower case indices i. Note that the expression of the Dirac\noperator D in terms of the operators DM , implies a specific basis \u0398M . We\nare free to choose another basis of one-forms as a linear combination with\n13\n\n\fcoefficients \u2208 A. However, once the Dirac operator is given in a specific basis\n\u0398M , we can calculate derivation of forms in this basis and then transform\nthe result to another basis whenever necessary.\nHaving outlined the construction of the operator algebra \u03a9\u2217D (A), we shall\nhenceforth abandon explicit mention of the distinction between universal\nforms and their representation as operators on H, and denote them by capital\nletters.\n\n3\n\nAlgebraic Formulation of Riemannian geometry within the framework of NCG\n\nThe construction of the universal algebra of differential forms based on a\npseudo-Riemannian manifold follows the steps discussed in Sect.2. In its\napplication to the theory of gravitation in general relativity, we need to introduce the concept of a metric, the affine connection, the inner products of\none and two-forms, the torsion and curvature. In the NCG approach, the\nspectral triple consists of\nThe algebra A: The algebra C \u221e (M) of the analytic complex functions\non the manifold M.\nThe Hilbert space H: Square integral functions that belong to the direct\nproduct of A and the spinor bundle L2 (S, M).\nDirac operator D, whose representation in the Hilbert space H is to be\nspecified.\nThe starting point of the general theory of relativity is the Equivalence\nPrinciple, which postulates that in an arbitrary gravitational field (curved\nspace-time described by Riemannian geometry), it is possible to chose a locally inertial system (flat coordinate system), such that within a sufficiently\nsmall region, the laws of special relativity prevail. The transformation between the locally flat ortho-normal coordinate system and the general curved\ncoordinate system introduces the well known vierbeins that can be regarded\nas gravitational fields.\nThe general Equivalence Principle allows the introduction of the metric\nvia two sets of 1-forms \u0398A and \u0398M . The 1-forms \u0398A can be expanded in the\n\u0398M basis and vice versa,\n\n14\n\n\fA\n\u0398A = \u0398M EM\n,\n\n\u0398M = \u0398A EAM .\n\n(3.1)\n\nA\nEM\nand EAM are elements of A satisfying\nA M\nEM\nEB = \u03b4BA ,\n\nA N\nM\nEM\nEA = \u03b4N\n.\n\n(3.2)\n\nWe define a metric tensor G M N as the inner product of two 1-forms \u0398M\nand \u0398N . The inner product of 1-forms is defined as the sesqui-linear functional\n<, >: \u03a91D \u00d7 \u03a91D \u2212\u2192 A,\nand\nG M N \u2261< \u0398M , \u0398N > .\n\n(3.3)\n\nG AB \u2261< \u0398A , \u0398B >= \u03b7 AB .\n\n(3.4)\n\nG M N are functions that are elements of the algebra A, the algebra of\ninfinitely smooth functions on the Riemannian manifold. As the algebra\nA is unital, \u03b7 AB ( where \u03b7 AB = diag(\u22121, 1, ..., 1)) is also an element of A.\nTherefore, we can choose the one-forms \u0398A so that they satisfy\n\nWe reserve Latin uppercase A, B, ... to denote the \"locally-flat\" indices and\nM, N, ... to denote the \"curved\" or \"derivative\" indices in the basis \u0398M .\nFrom Eqns.(3.3) and (3.4) we can derive the relation\n< \u0398A , \u0398B >\n\n=\n=\n\nA\n\u1ebcM\n\nA\nB\n\u03b7 AB = < \u0398M EM\n, \u0398N EN\n>\nA MN B\nM\nN\nB\n< \u0398 , \u0398 > EN = \u1ebcM G EN ,\n\n(3.5)\n\nA\nwhere, \u1ebcM\ndenotes the involutive operation if it is defined for the algebra A,\nA\notherwise it is EM\n.\nWe note that the metric structure is determined if the curvilinear and\nlocally orthonormal bases are given. The vierbein as a transformation matrix between the two bases determines the metric tensor. In the algebraic\nconstruction, it is more convenient to use these bases as a starting point to\nconstruct the Riemannian geometry.\nIf U is a general 1-form, U = \u0393M UM = \u0393A UA , the transformation between\nits components in the two coordinate systems is given by\n\n15\n\n\fA\nUM = EM\nUA\n\n,\n\nUA = EAM UM ,\n\n(3.6)\n\nA\nwhere EAM is the inverse matrix of EM\n.\nIn particular, in the locally orthonormal basis, the exterior derivative of\narbitrary forms must be first calculated in the curvilinear basis and then\ntransformed back to the locally flat one by using the above transformations.\nFor instance,\n\n(DF )A = EAM DM F,\n\n(3.7)\n\n1\n(DU)AB = EAM EBN (DM UN \u2212 DN UM ).\n(3.8)\n2\nThe inner product of the basis 1-forms in Eqns.(3.3)and (3.5) generates the\ninner product in the vector space of 1-forms between U = \u0398M UM and V =\n\u0398M VM given by\n< U, V >= \u0168M G M N VN = \u0168 N VN .\n(3.9)\nThe covariant derivative operator ( affine connection), \u2207, is given by the\nconnection 1-forms \u03a9A\nB , where\n\u2207\u0398A = \u0398B\n\nO\n\nB\n\u03a9A\nB = \u0398\n\nO\n\n\u0398C \u03a9A\nBC .\n\n(3.10)\n\nThe Cartan structure equations define the torsion and curvature 2-forms\nof a given connection \u03a9AB as follows:\nT A = D\u0398A \u2212 \u0398B \u2227 \u03a9A\nB,\n\n(3.11)\n\nA\nA\nC\nRB\n= D\u03a9A\nB + \u03a9C \u2227 \u03a9B .\n\n(3.12)\n\nIn Eqns.(3.11) and (3.12), we need a definition of the wedge product of\n1-forms. Such a definition, as explained in Sect.2, becomes specific when the\nrepresentation mapping \u03c0 is given. Here we only assume that the module of\n2-forms is spanned by the formal wedge products \u0398A \u2227 \u0398B of 1-forms. For\nthe ordinary space-time components, the anti-symmetrization is the standard\nconvention. However, there is no requirement that it must be the case for\nother generalized components. In general, there are various ways to define\nthe wedge product, depending on the specific applications.\n16\n\n\fThe Cartan structure equations (3.11) and (3.12) are not sufficient to\ndetermine connection, torsion and curvature in terms of the vierbeins. In\nthe conventional differential geometry, one generally imposes two additional\nconstraints: i) the metric compatibility condition\n\u03a9AB = \u2212\u03a9BA\n\n(3.13)\n\nand ii) the torsion free condition\nT A = 0.\n\n(3.14)\n\nWith these two constraints, the first structure equation determines the\nconnection completely in terms of the vierbeins. The second structure equation, in turn, determines the curvature in terms of the connection.\nTo calculate the scalar curvature from the curvature two-form, Eqn.(3.12),\nthe inner product of 2-forms is introduced as given by\n<\u0398A \u2227 \u0398B , \u0398C \u2227 \u0398D > \u2261 \u03b7 AD \u03b7 BC \u2212 \u03b7 AC \u03b7 BD .\n\n(3.15)\n\nThis inner product can also be extended for two arbitrary 2-forms G \u2261\n\u0398A \u2227 \u0398B GAB and H \u2261 \u0398A \u2227 \u0398B HAB , GAB , HAB \u2208 A as follows:\n<G, H> = G\u0303AB <\u0398A \u2227 \u0398B , \u0398C \u2227 \u0398D >HCD .\n\n(3.16)\n\nFinally, we note that the \u0393-matrix representation is given by the following\nhomomorphism \u0393\n\u0393(\u0398A ) = \u0393A ,\n\n\u0393(\u0398M ) = \u0393M ,\n\n(3.17)\n\nwhere \u0393A are given as constant \"flat\" Dirac matrices. The concrete form of\nthe \"curved\" Dirac matrices \u0393M (x) is not known since it involves gravitational degrees of freedom through the vielbeins,\n\u0393M (x) = EAM \u0393A .\n\n(3.18)\n\nAny specific assumption about the form of \u0393M independent of the above\nequation will be an arbitrary restriction on the metric structure 3 .\n3\n\nIn spite of this obvious fact, this kind of hidden assumption is often made in the\nliterature without an explicit statement.\n\n17\n\n\fWith the defining homomorphism (3.17) , we can transform the various\nformula in the \u0398 basis to the corresponding ones in the \u0393-representation\nbasis. Thus, for instance, the metric tensor is given by the inner product\n1\nGM N =< \u0393M , \u0393N >= T r(\u0393M \u0393N ),\n4\n\n(3.19)\n\nwhere the trace is taken over the spinor indices. From Eqn.(3.5), the expression of the metric tensor in terms of the vierbeins is given as\nG M N = \u1ebcAM \u03b7 AB EBN .\n\n(3.20)\n\nOther details will be given in the next section where we use explicitly the\n\u0393-matrix representation.\n\n4\n\nGeometry in two-sheeted space-time\n\nIn this section, we shall apply the general formalism developed in the previous\nsection to the case of a two-sheeted space-time with a specific choice for the\nspectral triple.\n\n4.1\n\nNoncommutative differential forms in two-sheeted\nspace-time\n\nIntuitively, two-sheeted space-time can be viewed as an extension of the\nphysical four-dimensional space-time manifold M by a discrete, internal space\n{a, b}. In other words, it is a discretized version of Kaluza-Klein theory [25]\nwhere the circle is replaced by two discrete points in the fifth dimension. This\ndiscretized Kaluza-Klein theory avoids the truncation inconsistency problem\nof the original theory since it has a finite field content with a finite mass\nspectrum [18, 19].\nAs discussed in the preceding sections, the requisite input for this model\nis the spectral triple, to which we apply the general techniques discussed in\nSects 2.3 and 2.4. The algebra of smooth functions considered in Section 2.2\nbecomes C \u221e (M, C) tensored with the complex-valued functions on the set\n{a, b}. Clearly any such function, f : {a, b} \u2192 C can be written f = fa \u2295 fb ,\neach summand being isomorphic to C itself.\n18\n\n\fA \u2261 C \u221e (M) \u2297 (C \u2295 C) \u223c\n= C \u221e (M, C) \u2295 C \u221e (M, C).\n\n(4.1)\n\nH \u2261 L2 (S, M) \u2295 L2 (S, M).\n\n(4.2)\n\nIn our previous work, where we were concerned with only gravity [17,\nL\n19, 18], it was sufficient to have the algebra C \u221e (R, M) C \u221e (R, M). In the\npresent paper, since we are also interested in matter fields coupled to gravity,\nwe choose to begin with the more general algebra (4.1). However, we will find\nat the end, physics determines a subalgebra of (4.1) as physically relevant.\nIn Eqn.(4.1) we have essentially doubled the algebra presented in Sect.2.2,\nit is natural to take the representation space as the Hilbert space of squareintegrable sections of a spinor bundle,\n\nThe third element of the spectral triple is the generalized self-adjoint\nDirac operator\nD = \u0393M DM , M = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5\n(4.3)\nwith the generalization of the gamma matrices \u03b3 \u03bc given by\n\u0393\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u2261\n\n\u03b3\u03bc 0\n0 \u03b3\u03bc\n\n!\n\n\u0393\n\n,\n\n5\n\n0 \u03b35\n\u03b35 0\n\n\u2261\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(4.4)\n\nWith the basis specified, it is now possible to give an explicit form of the\ngeneralized derivatives on the functions of the Hilbert space H. The direct\ngeneralization of the ordinary spacetime derivative \u2202\u03bc follows obviously,\n\u2202\u03bc 0\n0 \u2202\u03bc\n\nD\u03bc \u2261\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(4.5)\n\nThese derivatives act along each of the space-time sheets. The derivative\nbetween the two sheets is given as\nD5 \u2261 \u03c3 D\u03045 ,\nwhere\nD\u03045 \u2261\n\n0 m\nm 0\n\n!\n\n,\n\n\u03c3 \u2261\n\n(4.6)\n0 1\n1 0\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(4.7)\n\nThe parameter m has the dimension of mass in order to give the fifth\ncomponent of spacetime the same dimension as the other components. If we\nformally write the operator DF as,\n19\n\n\fD(F ) \u2261 [D, F ] = \u0393M (DF )M = \u0393M DM F,\n\n(4.8)\n\nwe indeed obtain the derivative along the fifth dimension with the same\ndimension as other derivatives\nD5 F = \u03c3[D\u03045 , F ] = m(F \u2212 F\u0303 ),\nwhere\nF\u0303 =\n\nf2 0\n0 f1\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(4.9)\n\n(4.10)\n\nAs required for the spectral triple, the operator D on H is self-adjoint\nwith respect to the inner product\n<\u03c8|D\u03c6> = <D \u2020 \u03c8|\u03c6>\n\n,\n\nD = D\u2020 .\n\n(4.11)\n\nA straightforward definition of the generalized wedge product used in the\nprevious work [17, 18, 19] is the fully anti-symmetric product that truncates\nall the \"junk\" forms in a trivial way, namely,\n1\n\u0393M \u2227 \u0393N = (\u0393M \u0393N \u2212 \u0393N \u0393M ).\n2\n\n(4.12)\n\nHowever, in this paper, since we would like to have the quartic Higgs\npotential in the gauge sector, we will adopt the wedge product with the\nfollowing change in Eqn.(4.12), when M, N = 5,\n\u03935 \u2227 \u03935 = 1.\n\n(4.13)\n\nThis extended definition of the wedge product can be used in noncommutative geometric constructions of the Standard Model. The emergence of a\nquartic potential, however, as we shall see later, requires the fifth dimension\nto be complex.\nWith the given spectral triple, it is straightforward to construct the algebra of forms on the two-sheeted space-time. For later use, we work out the\ngeneralized \u03b3-matrix representations of one-forms and their derivatives. The\nexterior derivative of any odd form is its anti-commutator with the operator D as a consequence of the Leibnitz rule for the generalized forms (2.30).\nHence the exterior derivative DU of the generalized one-form U = \u0393M UM is\n20\n\n\fDU = {D, U} = \u0393M \u2227 \u0393N (DU)M N ,\n\n(4.14)\n\n1\n(D\u03bc U\u03bd \u2212 D\u03bd U\u03bc )\n(DU)\u03bc\u03bd =\n2\n(DU)\u03bc5 = \u2212(DU)5\u03bc = 12 (D\u03bc U5 \u2212 D5 U\u03bc )\n(DU)55 =\nm(U5 + \u01685 ).\n\n(4.15)\n\nThe components (DU)M N can be calculated with the help of the formulae\n(4.12) and (4.13) giving\n\n4.2\n\nRiemannian geometry on a two-sheeted spacetime\n\nThe Equivalence Principle extended to our two-sheeted space-time requires\na locally orthonormal basis. Continuing to work with the \u0393-representation,\nthe locally orthonormal \u0398A given in Sect.3 are now represented by \u0393A ,\n\u03b3a 0\n0 \u03b3a\n\n\u0393a \u2261\n\n!\n\n\u03935\u0307 \u2261\n\n,\n\n0 \u03b35\n\u03b35 0\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(4.16)\n\nwhere \u03b3 a and \u03b3 5 are the usual flat Dirac matrices. By choosing \u03b3 5 we have\nspecialized to the two sheets of spacetime of chiral spinors. We shall use a 5\u0307\nindex in the orthonormal basis to distinguish it from 5 in the general case.\nThe inner product now can be also taken as a trace over the Clifford\nindices. In the representation (4.16), the following orthogonality is manifest:\n< \u0393A , \u0393B >\n\n= T r(\u0393A \u0393B ) = 2\u03b7 AB .1\n\n(4.17)\n\nThe curvilinear \u0398M will be represented by \u0393M . To obtain \u0393M and define the metric, we postulate the generalized vielbeins EAM , as the following\ndiagonal matrix zero-forms:\nEa\u03bc\n\ne\u03bc1a 0\n0 e\u03bc2a\n\n\u2261\n\nEa5 \u2261 \u2212\nE5\u03075\n\na1a 0\n0 a2a\n\u2261\n\n!\n\n!\n\n\u2261 \u2212Aa = \u2212Ea\u03bc A\u03bc ,\n\n\u03c6\u22121\n0\n1\n0 \u03c6\u22121\n2\n21\n\nE5\u0307\u03bc \u2261 0 ,\n\n,\n\n!\n\n\u2261 \u03a6\u22121 ,\n\n(4.18)\n\n\fwhere e\u03bc1,2a are two different vielbeins on the two sheets of space-time. Similarly, a1,2 and \u03c61,2 are respectively vector and scalar fields. The dependence\non the space-time variable ,x, of the above vielbeins is understood. In what\nfollows, we shall, for the sake of simplicity of the formulas, continue to suppress the x-dependence.\nThe vielbeins EAM are invertible giving,\nE\u03bca\n\nE\u03bc5\u0307\n\nea1\u03bc 0\n0 ea2\u03bc\n\n\u2261\n\nE55\u0307\n\n\u2261 A\u03bc \u03a6 ,\n\n!\n\n,\n\nE5a \u2261 0 ,\n\u03c61 0\n0 \u03c62\n\n\u2261\n\n!\n\n\u2261 \u03a6 .\n\n(4.19)\n\nThen, the \u0393M matrices are given as \u0393M = \u0393A EAM ,\n\n\u0393\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u2261\n\n\u03b3 a e\u03bc1a\n0\na \u03bc\n0\n\u03b3 e2a\n\n!\n\n,\n\n\u0393\n\n5\n\n\u2261\n\n\u2212a1 \u03b3 5 \u03c6\u22121\n2\n\u03b3 5 \u03c6\u22121\n\u2212a2\n1\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(4.20)\n\nwhere a1,2 = \u03b3 a a1,2a are two gauge connection one-forms on the two sheets.\nUsing the inner product defined as the trace on the Hilbert space, we can\ncalculate the representation of the metric tensor as follows:\nGM N\n\n=\n=\n\n1\nT r(\u0393M \u0393N )\n2\n\n= 21 \u1ebcAM T r(\u0393A \u0393B )EBN\n\u1ebcAM \u03b7 AB EBN .\n\n(4.21)\n\nIn terms of the functions Ea\u03bc , A\u03bc and \u03a6 the metric tensor can be expressed\nas,\n\nG\u03bc\u03bd = G\u03bc\u03bd\n,\n0\n5\u03bc\n\u03bc\nG\n= \u2212A ,\n\nG\u03bc5 = \u2212A\u03bc ,\nG55 = A2 + \u03a6\u22122 ,\n\nG\u03bc\u03bd = G0\u03bc\u03bd + A\u03bc A\u03bd \u03a62 , G\u03bc5 = A\u03bc \u03a62 ,\nG5\u03bc =\nA\u03bc \u03a62\n, G55 = \u03a62 .\n\n(4.22)\n(4.23)\n\nThe function G0 is a generalized function with the metrics of the two\nspace-time sheets on the diagonal\nG\u03bc\u03bd\n0\n\n\u2261\n\ne\u03bc1a \u03b7 ab e\u03bd1b\n0\n0\ne\u03bc2a \u03b7 ab e\u03bd2b\n22\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(4.24)\n\n\fAs we see from the trace of the generalized gamma matrices, no restrictions on the vielbeins can be derived if a consistent choice of basis is selected.\nWe can only derive the formulae of generalized metric components in terms\nof the given vielbein components from Eqn.(4.21), which is in perfect analogy\nwith the usual Riemannian geometry.\nIn terms of \u0393-representations, an arbitrary generalized one-form U can\nbe represented in both \u0393-bases as follows:\nU = \u0393A UA = \u0393M UM ,\nwhere UM and UA are diagonal matrix functions\nUA =\n\nu1A 0\n0 u2A\n\n!\n\nUM =\n\n,\n\nu1M\n0\n0 u2M\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(4.25)\n\nThe functions UM and UA are related to each other by the transformation\nlaws,\nA\nUM = EM\nUA ,\n\nUA = EAM UM .\n\n(4.26)\n\nIn terms of the functions E\u03bca , A\u03bc and \u03a6, the transformation laws can be\nwritten as\nU\u03bc = E\u03bca Ua + A\u03bc \u03a6U5\u0307 , U5 = \u03a6U5\u0307 ,\nUa = Ea\u03bc (U\u03bc \u2212 A\u03bc U5 ),\n\nU5\u0307 = \u03a6\u22121 U5 .\n\n(4.27)\n\nThe multiplication of two one-forms U and V is given by\nUV = (\u0393A UA ).(\u0393B VB ) = (\u0393M UM ).(\u0393N UN )\n\n(4.28).\n\nHere we want to address two issues concerning the multiplication of 1forms: Firstly, as we don't know the explicit form of the matrices \u0393M to rearrange the order of terms in NCG, it is convenient to carry out the multiplication in the \u0393A basis. In fact, using the explicit form of \u0393A in Eqn.(4.16), we\ncan reorder the product in Eqn.(4.28). Secondly, as the explicit forms of the\nbasis \u0393A are known, we can define the wedge product by anti-symmetrizing\nthe product except for the component \u03935\u0307 \u2227 \u03935\u0307 , which we will keep as a formal\nnon-vanishing basis of the 'two-forms' algebra \u03a92 (A). That is to say, we have\n\n23\n\n\fto define the wedge product of the \u0393A matrices with the basis \u03c3 AB of the\n'two-forms' module \u03a92 (A), to be given by\n1\n\u03c3 AB = \u0393A \u2227 \u0393B = [\u0393A , \u0393B ],\n2\n\n(4.29).\n\nwhen both A and B are not 5\u0307. And when A = B = 5\u0307 we have\n\u03935\u0307 \u2227 \u03935\u0307\n\n(4.30).\n\nas a formal basis vector. This component will generate a Higgs potential for\nthe gauge fields.\nFrom Eqn.(4.29), it is clear that\n\u0393A \u2227 \u0393B = \u2212\u0393B \u2227 \u0393A .\n\n(4.31).\n\nexcept the product \u03935\u0307 \u2227 \u03935\u0307 .\nNow we know how to reorder the product in Eqn.(4.27) to define the\nwedge product of two 1-forms. The generalized functions commute with the\nmatrices \u0393a . The commutation rule of a function F with the matrix \u03935\u0307 is as\nfollows\nF \u03935\u0307 = \u03935\u0307 F\u0303 .\n(4.32).\nIt then follows that the product of two 1-forms U and V in Eqn.(4.28) can\nbe defined as the wedge product\nU \u2227 V = \u0393A \u2227 \u0393B (U \u2227 V )AB .\n\n(4.33).\n\nand using the Eqns.(4.26), we can compute the component of the wedge\nproduct U \u2227 V in the locally flat frame,\n\u2212 Ub Va ) = 12 (Ea\u03bc Eb\u03bd \u2212 Ea\u03bd Eb\u03bc )\n\u00d7 (U\u03bc V\u03bd + A\u03bc (U\u03bd V5 \u2212 V\u03bd U5 )),\n= \u2212(U \u2227 V )a5\u0307 = 21 (U5\u0307 Va \u2212 \u0168a V5\u0307 )\n= 12 \u03a6\u22121 [U5 Ea\u03bc (V\u03bc \u2212 A\u03bc V5 ) \u2212 \u1ebca\u03bc V5 (\u0168\u03bc \u2212 \u00c3\u03bc \u01685 )],\n= \u01685\u0307 V5\u0307 = (\u03a6\u03a6\u0303)\u22121 \u01685 V5 .\n\n(U \u2227 V )ab =\n(U \u2227 V )5\u0307a\n(U \u2227 V )5\u03075\u0307\n\n1\n(Ua Vb\n2\n\n(4.34).\n\nAs a special case, we can calculate the wedge product of \u0393M one-forms\nas\n\n(\u0393M \u2227 \u0393N )ab =\n(\u0393M \u2227 \u0393N )5\u0307a =\n(\u0393M \u2227 \u0393N )5\u03075\u0307 =\n\n1\n(EaM EbN \u2212 EaN EbM ),\n2\n1\n(E5\u0307M EaN \u2212 \u1ebcaM E5\u0307N ),\n2\n\u1ebc5\u0307M E5\u0307N .\n\n24\n\n(4.35).\n\n\fThe derivative DU of the 1-form U in the curved space-time basis follows\nfrom (4.15) and is given by\n\nand hence\n\nDU = \u0393M \u2227 \u0393N (DU)M N = \u0393A \u2227 \u0393B (DU)AB\n=\n\u0393A \u2227 \u0393B (\u0393M \u2227 \u0393N )AB (DU)M N ,\n\n(DU)ab = 12 (Ea\u03bc Eb\u03bd \u2212 Ea\u03bd Eb\u03bc )(D\u03bc U\u03bd + A\u03bc (D\u03bd U5 \u2212 D5 U\u03bd ),\n(DU)5\u0307a = \u2212(DU)a5\u0307 = \u2212 21 \u03a6\u22121 [ 21 (Ea\u03bc + \u1ebca\u03bc )(D\u03bc U5 \u2212 D5 U\u03bd )\n+m(Ea\u03bc A\u03bc \u2212 \u1ebca\u03bc \u00c3\u03bc )(U5 + \u01685 )],\n(DU)5\u03075\u0307 =\n\u2212m(\u03a6\u03a6\u0303)\u22121 (U5 + \u01685 )\n\n(4.36).\n\n(4.37).\n\nThe inner product of two 2-forms\n1\n< \u0393A \u2227 \u0393B , \u0393C \u2227 \u0393D >\u2261 T r4 (\u0393A \u0393B \u0393C \u0393D ) = \u03b7 AD \u03b7 BC \u2212 \u03b7 AC \u03b7 BD . (4.38).\n4\nSimilarly, we can give a representation of the general p-forms, multiplication rules of a p-form and a q-form and the derivative of general p-forms.\nThe use of the two frames is essential in such calculus. To summarize, it is\nconvenient to carry out the multiplication in the \u0393A basis and the derivatives in the \u0393M basis and then transform to the \u0393A to obtain the desired\ncomponents. The physical fields are given in the curved frame.\nThe definition of \u03935\u0307 \u2227 \u03935\u0307 is rather arbitrary but is required to retain the\n5\u03075\u0307 component for a Higgs potential to survive in the gauge theory. It is more\nnatural to introduce the discrete degrees of freedom as a pair of conjugate\nderivatives Dz , Dz\u0304 as in [9, 10] than just a single D5 in the Dirac operator.\nIn the gravitational sector, the curvature arises from a set of connection\none-forms {\u03a9A\nB A, B = 0, ...5\u0307}. The connection coefficients are defined as\nthose functions which arise in the expansion of \u03a9A\nB in the \u0393-basis, as the\ngeneralization of (3.10),\nC A\n\u03a9A\n(4.39)\nB \u2261 \u0393 \u03a9BC .\n\n5\n\nPhysical content of the gravity sector in\ntwo-sheeted space-time\n\nIn Section 4., we have seen that the metric (vielbein) structure of the\ntwo-sheeted space-time contains a tensor, a vector and a scalar, which have\n25\n\n\fgeneralized functions in Eqn.(4.18). This field content is exactly parallel to\nthe one in the traditional Kaluza-Klein theory [25]. However, each generalized function has a pair of fields. Therefore, in principle, the gravity sector\nin the two-sheeted space-time, contains a pair of tensor, a pair of vector and\na pair of scalar fields.\nIntuitively as stated earlier, the two-sheeted space-time is a discretized\nversion of the general untruncated Kaluza-Klein theory [26], where the internal space circle is replaced by two points. Therefore, intuition tells us that\nin general, we should expect one member of each pair to be massless and the\nother massive [18].\n\n5.1\n\nMinimal set of constraints and solutions of the\nfirst Cartan structure equation\n\nThe essential point is how to impose a consistent system of constraints to\nsolve the generalized Cartan structure equations without overconstraining\nthe metric. The second Cartan structure equation is used to calculate the\ncurvature tensor in terms of the connections. Therefore, it does not have\nmuch to do with constraints. The first Cartan structure equation expresses\na relationship between connections and torsion. Its component equations are\nas follows:\nTabc = (D\u0393a )bc + 21 (\u03a9abc \u2212 \u03a9acb )\nTa5\u0307b = (D\u0393a )5\u0307b + 21 (\u03a9a5\u0307b \u2212 \u03a9ab5\u0307 )\nT5\u0307ab = (D\u03935\u0307 )ab + 21 (\u03a95\u0307ab \u2212 \u03a95\u0307ba )\nT5\u03075\u0307b = (D\u03935\u0307 )5\u0307b + 12 (\u03a95\u03075\u0307b \u2212 \u03a95\u0307b5\u0307 )\n(5.1)\nTab5\u0307 = (D\u0393a )b5\u0307 + 21 (\u03a9ab5\u0307 \u2212 \u03a9a5\u0307b )\nT5\u0307a5\u0307 = (D\u03935\u0307 )a5\u0307 + 12 (\u03a95\u0307a5\u0307 \u2212 \u03a95\u03075\u0307a )\nTa5\u03075\u0307 = (D\u0393a )5\u03075\u0307 + 21 (\u03a9a5\u03075\u0307 + \u03a9\u0303a5\u03075\u0307 )\nT5\u03075\u03075\u0307 = (D\u03935\u0307 )5\u03075\u0307 + 12 (\u03a95\u03075\u03075\u0307 + \u03a9\u03035\u03075\u03075\u0307 ).\nObviously these equations are not enough to determine both the torsion and\nthe connection, even in the case of the ordinary geometry.\nThe torsion free condition T A = 0 together with the metric compatibility\ncondition turns out to be too restrictive giving only a theory without massive\nexcitations. However, it is possible to impose constraints in such a way as\nto retain all the postulated fields in the metric structure in more than one\nway [18, 19, 20]. In this paper we will follow the results of [20] to impose the\n26\n\n\ffollowing minimal set of constraints:\ni) Spacetime torsion free condition\nTaBC\n\n=\n\n0,\n\n(5.2.a)\n\nii) Metric compatibility condition\n\u03a9AB\n\n=\n\n\u2212 \u03a9BA\n\n(5.2.b)\n\niii) An additional condition on the connections.\n\u03a9AB5\u0307\n\n=\n\n0\n\n(5.2.c)\n\nWith these conditions, Eqn.(5.1) can be solved giving the following solutions\nfor the non-vanishing connection and torsion-tensor components,\n\u03a9abc\n\u03a9a5\u0307b\n\u03a95\u0307ab\nT5\u0307bc\nT5\u03075\u0307b\nT5\u03075\u03075\u0307\n\n= \u2212(D\u0393a )bc + (D\u0393b )ac \u2212 (D\u0393c )ba\n=\n\u22122(D\u0393a )5\u0307b\n=\n2(D\u0393a )5\u0307b\n= (D\u03935\u0307 )bc + (D\u0393b )5\u0307c \u2212 (D\u0393c )5\u0307b\n=\n(D\u03935\u0307 )5\u0307b\n=\n(D\u03935\u0307 )5\u03075\u0307 .\n\n(5.3)\n\nThe righthand side of Eqns containing the components of (D\u0393A ) can be\nexpressed in terms of metric components ( vielbeins ) and their derivatives by\nthe rules already stated. Thus, we have non-vanishing torsion and connection\ncoefficients in terms of metric fields.\nHere let us note that no constraints are imposed on the metric components\n(vielbeins). Therefore, all the six fields will contribute to the scalar curvature.\nIf all of them have appropriate kinetic terms in the final action, they will\nrepresent themselves as physical fields of the gravity sector of our theory.\nHowever, the fields e\u03bc1,2 a , a1,2 \u03bc and \u03c61,2 turn out not to be good variables\nof the theory. They do not give rise to mass eigenstates except in the case\ne1 = e2 , a1 = a2 , when the theory reduces exactly to the zero mode sector of\nthe Kaluza-Klein theory with massless fields.\nIn the next subsection, we define linear combinations of these fields which\nlead to appropriate fields leading to mass eigenstates.\n\n27\n\n\f5.2\n\nNew physical field variables\n\nWe begin with the following linear combinations as new physical field variables:\ne\u03bc\u00b1a = 21 (e\u03bc1 a \u00b1 e\u03bc2 \u03bd ),\na\u00b1\u03bc\u03bd = 21 (a1\u03bc \u00b1 a2\u03bc ),\n(5.4)\n1\n\u03c6\u00b1 =\n(\u03c61 \u00b1 \u03c62 ).\n2\n\nWhen e\u03bc\u2212 \u03bd = a\u2212 \u03bc = \u03c6\u2212 = 0, the theory reduces to the usual KaluzaKlein theory with e\u03bc+ a as the vierbein, a+\u03bc the vector field and \u03c6+ the BransDicke scalar.\nTo obtain the \"physical\" action functional in terms of the new variables,\nwe need to define Ea\u03bc and its inverse E\u03bca in terms of the new variables. This\nis not as straightforward as one would think.\nTo this end, we start with\nEa\u03bc\n\n=\n\ne\u03bc1a 0\n0 e\u03bc2a\n\n!\n\n= e\u03bca 1 + va\u03bc .r\n\n,\n\n(5.5).\n\nwhere va\u03bc = e\u03bc\u2212a and e\u03bca = e\u03bca+ . Let ea\u03bc = (e\u03bca )\u22121 and\n1 =\n\n1 0\n0 1\n\n!\n\n,\n\nr =\n\n1 0\n0 \u22121\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(5.6).\n\nFrom the orthogonality relation of the vielbeins\nEa\u03bc E\u03bcb = \u03b4ba 1\n\n(5.7)\n\nE\u03bca = (ea\u03bc \u2212 v\u03bc\u03bd sa\u03bd )1 + sa\u03bc r,\n\n(5.8)\n\nv\u03bc\u03bd + s\u03bd\u03c3 (\u03b4\u03bc\u03c3 \u2212 v\u03bc\u03bb v\u03bb\u03c3 ) = 0,\n\n(5.9)\n\nwe obtain\nwhere\n\nsa\u03bc\n\nis a non-linear function of\n\nv\u03bca\n\nsatisfying\n\nand s\u03bd\u03c3 = e\u03bda sa\u03c3 .\nThe tensor field v \u03bc\u03bd is a candidate for a massive excitation of the massless\nsymmetric metric tensor.\nWe can also use the metric tensors g \u03bc\u03bd and g\u03bc\u03bd to raise and lower indices\nand express the tensor fields v and s in a matrix notation, v = [v\u03bc\u03bd ] , s =\n[s\u03bd\u03bc ].\n28\n\n\fThe following algebraic relations are also valid\nvs = sv\n\n,\n\ns = v(v 2 \u2212 1)\u22121 .\n\n(5.10)\n\nThe usual space-time component of the generalized vierbein Ea\u03bc and its\ninverse E\u03bca are determined completely in terms of the usual vierbeins e\u03bca , ea\u03bc\nand the tensor field v \u03bc\u03bd .\nFurthermore, we can define the vector and scalar components of the metric by\nA\u03bc = a+ \u03bc 1 + a\u2212 \u03bc r ,\n\u03a6 =\n\u03c6+ 1 + \u03c6\u2212 r .\n\n(5.11)\n\nHence, finally, the gravity sector of the theory contains e\u03bca , ea\u03bc , the tensor\nfield v\u03bd\u03bc , the vector and scalar fields a\u00b1\u03bc , \u03c6\u00b1 . The tensor field s\u03bc\u03bd is not an\nindependent field. It is a non-linear combination of v\u03bc\u03bd . As we will see in\nthe final Lagrangian, the tensor field v \u03bc\u03bd will be a mass eigenstate. We are,\ntherefore, led to make the assumption, v \u03bc\u03bd = v \u03bd\u03bc , in order to have v \u03bc\u03bd as an\nindependent tensor field.\nAs we shall also see, the signature of the kinetic terms of the fields v \u03bc\u03bd ,\na\u03bc and \u03c6\u2212 in the final Lagrangian built from curvature and torsion terms of\nour theory, requires the following field redefinitions,\nv\u03bca\na\u2212\u03bc\n\u03c6\u2212\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\n\niv\u03bca ,\nia\u2212\u03bc ,\ni\u03c6\u2212 .\n\n(5.12)\n\nThis field redefinition will be used hereafter in this paper.\nIt is convenient to introduce the following quantities in further calculations:\nPa\u03bc\u03bd\n=\n\u2202\u03bc (ea\u03bd + sa\u03bb v\u03bd\u03bb ) \u2212 2ma\u03bd\u2212 sa\u03bc\nQa\u03bc\u03bd\n=\n\u2202\u03bc sa\u03bd + 2ma\u03bd+ sa\u03bc\n(5.13)\n[\u03bc,\u03bd]\n\u03bc \u03bd\nXbc\n=\n(eb ec \u2212 e\u03bdb e\u03bcc + vb\u03bd vc\u03bc \u2212 vb\u03bc vc\u03bd )\n[\u03bc,\u03bd]\nYbc\n= (e\u03bcb vc\u03bd \u2212 e\u03bdb vc\u03bc + vb\u03bc e\u03bdc \u2212 vb\u03bd e\u03bcc ).\n\nIn several formulae of this theory, Pa\u03bc\u03bd and Qa\u03bc\u03bd generalize the field deriva[\u03bc,\u03bd]\ntives \u2202\u03bc ea\u03bd and \u2202\u03bc va\u03bd . The Xab generalize the usual term e\u03bca e\u03bdb \u2212 e\u03bda e\u03bcb which\n[\u03bc,\u03bd]\nis common in general relativity. Some useful contraction formulae for Xab\n29\n\n\f[\u03bc,\u03bd]\n\nand Yab can be found in Appendix A.2.

The various fields we have introduced do not have the desired physical dimensions. Just as we needed to\nredefine the fields ( Eqns.(5.12) and (6.7) ) to secure the coorect signs for\nthe kinetic terms, we need to rescale them using the avialable dimensional\nparameters in our theory. To this end, we note that we have only three dimensional parameters, GN the Newton gravitational constant, GV the new\n34\n\n\fgravitational constant from the torsion and the parameter m with dimensions\nof mass. The dimensionless gauge coupling g is the only other free parameter. By fixing the standard coefficients of the kinetic terms, we determine\nthe various coupling and masses in terms of the four parameters GN , GV , m\nand g.\n\n7.1\n\nKinetic terms and dimensions of the physical fields\nin the gravity sector\n\nThe Lagrangian of the gravity sector in Eqn.(5.21) contains the vierbeins e\u03bca\nthat define the physical metric in the form\n1\nr,\n(7.1)\n16\u03c0GN\nwhere r is the scalar curvature in the conventional Riemannian geometry.\nWe next consider the kinetic terms of the tensor field v \u03bc\u03bd (s\u03bc\u03bd ) by collecting together terms quadratic in these fields and quadratic in their derivatives.\nThey lead to the partial Lagrangian\nLr =\n\nLv\n\n=\n\n\u2212(4\u03c0GN )\u22121 \u2207\u03bb v\u03bc\u03bd \u2207\u03bb v \u03bc\u03bd + (2\u03c0GN )\u22121 \u2207\u03bb v\u03bc\u03bd \u2207\u03bc v \u03bb\u03bd\n+(4\u03c0GN )\u22121 \u2202\u03bc v\u03bd\u03bd \u2202 \u03bc v\u03c1\u03c1 \u2212 (2\u03c0GN )\u22121 \u2202\u03bc v\u03c1\u03c1 \u2207\u03bd v \u03bc\u03bd\n\u2212(4\u03c6GN )\u22121 m2 (v \u03bc\u03bd v\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 v\u03bc\u03bc v\u03bd\u03bd ).\n\n(7.2)\n\nTo obtain the correct kinetic coefficient for v \u03bc\u03bd , we need to define\nq\n\n(7.3)\n\n\u03c6+ \u2212\u2192 exp (2GV \u03c3)\n\u03c6\u2212 \u2212\u2192\n2GV \u03c6\u2212\n\n(7.4)\n\nv \u03bc\u03bd \u2212\u2192\n\n\u03c0GN v \u03bc\u03bd .\n\nWith this redefinition, which incidently, gives the correct dimension to v \u03bc\u03bd\n( because of GN ) and yields the Fierz-Pauli Lagrangian for a spin-2 tensor\nfield of mass m in curved spacetime.\nThe kinetic terms for the scalar fields are to be found from the Eqn.(A.4.6)\nin the Appdendix A.4.

To start with, we have\nreviewed algebraic formulation of the conventional differential geometry in\norder to set the stage for its generalization to noncommutative case.\nOur starting point for the two-sheeted space-time is the choice of the\nL\nalgebra A = C \u221e (C, M) C \u221e (C, M) as part of a spectral triple. However,\nour model leads us to a subalgebra where the two functions on two sheets\nare complex conjugates of each other. We are led to this subalgebra as the\nunderlying mathematical structure of the two-sheeted space-time dictated\nby physics. Our previous pure gravity theories on two-sheeted space-time\n[19, 18, 17] were constructed from a subalgebra of A, which consisted of a pair\nof real functions. In the present paper, the construction of a spontaneously\nbroken gauge theory requires that the fifth component of the gauge oneform must be a generalized complex valued function, with the values on the\ntwo sheets being complex conjugates of each other. To be mathematically\nconsistent, the same condition need to be imposed on the differential forms\nof the theory. The algebra of the generalized function F of the form\nF =\n\nf (x)\n0\n\u2217\n0\nf (x)\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(8.1)\n\nwhere f (x) is a complex valued function, forms a closed subalgebra of A.\nTherefore, the noncommutative geometry can be constructed consistently\nwith this subalgebra to describe the physics of chiral spinors and gauge fields\ncoupled to gravity on two-sheeted space-time. Remarkably, from the standpoint of physics, the restriction to this subalgebra is also required by the\n38\n\n\fsignature of the kinetic terms of the massive modes in the theory. Thus,\nstarting from a naturally general algebra, we have ended up with a restriction to a subalgebra to have a physically meaningful theory. Therefore, our\nresults show that there is an intimate interplay between the mathematically\nconsistent structure and physics in NCG.\nThe present theory also requires the definition of the wedge product to\nretain the Higgs quartic potential and to avoid the \"junk forms\" at the same\ntime. The theory also requires a consistent involutive operator, that makes\nthe theory consistent and the scalar products to be diagonal. The present\ntheory also takes advantage of a minimal solution of the Cartan-Maurer\nstructure equations, where the basic geometric quantities such as metric,\nconnection, torsion and curvature are completely expressed in terms of the\ngeneralized vielbeins without imposing any constraint on its most general\nform. Physics requires that with such solutions, the contribution from torsion must be included to give kinetic terms to the physical fields. In other\nwords, the mathematical structure of torsion is required by physics in this\ntheory.\nIt is worth noting here that, although the above structure is rather unique\nin its simplicity and consistency, it is possible to construct the theory in an\nalternative way. For example, if the fully anti-symmetric wedge product is\ndesired, one may resort to a Kahler structure of the internal space consisting\nof a pair of complex conjugates [9, 10]. In such a theory, the involutive operation can be chosen consistently to be the hermitian conjugate. This approach,\nin the context of the full standard model, is currently under investigation.\nFrom the point of view of physics, the model presented here possesses\na rich and complex structure that merits further exploration in many ways.\nThe generalized gravity sector that includes massive tensor, vector and scalar\nfields, introduces simultaneous vector and axial vector couplings to matter\nfields. Consequently, we have the possibility of parity violating interactions\ndue to gravity. In the context of a full standard model, we speculate that\nthese interactions may provide the much sought CP-violating interactions in\nthe early universe. This is further supported by the fact that such interactions\ninvolve GN as the coupling. Consequently, we expect them to be small and\nhence correct order of magnitude. Incidentally, the idea of two interacting\ngravitons, one massless and the other massive, goes back to Isham, Salam\nand Strathdee [27]. More recently,it has been a subject of study from various\ntheoretical points of view[28, 29]. It has also been pointed out by Damour\n39\n\n\fand Kogan that bigravity , which is the simplest form of multigravity arises\nnaturally in several different physical contexts such as brane configurations,\nKaluza-Klein reductions and non-commutative geometric models (ours is an\nexample), [30].\nIn the context of cosmology, it is worth noting that the gravitational sector\ncomes with a scalar field, an associated scalar potential and a cosmological\nconstant term. A scalar field and a scalar potential are invoked in current\nliterature to account for inflation and dark energy. Whether the potential\nin the model presented here has the desired features or not needs further\nexploration.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported in part (KCW)\nby the U.S.Department of Energy (DOE)under contract no.
