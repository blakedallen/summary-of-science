It has therefore proven very important in the study of physics beyond the Standard\nModel. On top of providing a UV completion of the theory, it has an elegant way of yielding\nanomaly-free and thus consistent theories. Constructing anomaly-free theories is a formidable\ntask, especially in higher dimensions, and if it was not for string theory, probably far fewer\nconsistent constructions would be known.\nHowever, anomaly freedom in string theory still imposes strong constraints on the gauge\ngroups. For heterotic string theory [1, 2], which will be dealt with in this paper, the only\ntwo possible gauge groups are SO(32) and E8 \u00d7 E8 . We will only consider the latter in this\npaper, but the results are of course also valid in other contexts. In addition to constraining\nthe possible gauge groups, anomaly cancellation requires the presence of axions. The anomaly\ncancellation mechanism via axions is known as the Green\u2013Schwarz mechanism [3].\nIn order to describe a heterotic string theory, one has to specify an underlying compactification geometry and a compatible description of the gauge sector. In this paper, we will\ndeal with 4d theories obtained from heterotic orbifold constructions [4\u20136] and their smooth\nCalabi\u2013Yau counterparts which are obtained via a blowup procedure (see [7\u201310] and [11, 12]\nfor a gauged linear sigma model (GLSM) approach).\nIn orbifold constructions, imposing modular invariance of the string partition function is\nsufficient to guarantee consistency of the theory via the Green\u2013Schwarz mechanism [13], where\nthe axion dual to the Kalb\u2013Ramond B2 field cancels the anomalies. Since there is only one\n1\n\n\faxion but many different possible anomalies, anomaly freedom requires that all anomalies\nare related such that the different anomalies can be canceled with one universal axion. This\nrequires the presence of at most one anomalous U (1) as well as a universal coupling of the\naxion to the spin and gauge connection.\nFor Calabi\u2013Yau compactifications, the picture is different. While the Bianchi identity\nensures the absence of purely non-Abelian anomalies, mixed Abelian\u2013non-Abelian anomalies\ncan still arise. These are again canceled via the Green\u2013Schwarz mechanism [14\u201317]. However,\nin contrast to the orbifold case, there can be more than one axion, and the axionic couplings\nare in general non-universal, even if there is only one axion. The reason is that in blowup, the\nadditional axions arise from internal cohomology 2-forms and their couplings are determined\nby the choice of the gauge bundle. This anomaly cancellation mechanism becomes important\nwhen considering line bundles over Calabi\u2013Yau spaces (see e.g. [18\u201320] for recent applications).\nBoth the orbifold and the Calabi\u2013Yau constructions are in general plagued by the common\nproblems of theories beyond the Standard Model, like too fast proton decay and the \u03bc problem.\nOne of the prevailing methods of circumventing these problems are discrete symmetries which\nforbid the associated superpotential terms. For orbifold constructions, it has recently been\nargued [21] that there is a unique R\n4 symmetry which fulfills all constraints and is compatible\nwith SO(10) grand unification. The authors used anomaly universality in their uniqueness argumentation. While correct for pure orbifold constructions, anomaly universality is in general\nnot satisfied, and one purpose of this paper is to clarify this confusion: As we discuss, universality is neither required from a bottom-up point of view nor expected for general heterotic\nCalabi\u2013Yau constructions.\nIn order to illustrate these points, we present a rather simple model, which is based on\nthe blowup of the T 6 / 3 orbifold with line bundles, such that only two U (1) factors arise.\nThe anomalies are non-universal and canceled by the non-universal axions from the reduction\nalong the internal 2-forms. Along the way, one of the models also provides a simple example\nfor a U (1) which is omalous1 but nevertheless massive. In addition, we use the model to\nillustrate how discrete (R and non-R) symmetries arise in Calabi\u2013Yau models. Ultimately,\nthese symmetries can be of utter importance for string phenomenology.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we review anomalies and the Green\u2013\nSchwarz mechanism. In Section 3, we discuss the consequences of non-universal anomalies.\nFirst we discuss a bottom-up approach and argue that anomaly universality is generically\nnot realized. Then, we discuss a top-down approach using a simple string realization of nonuniversal anomaly cancellation. We present our model and work out the anomalies and the\nmasses of the Abelian gauge bosons. In Section 4, we investigate the presence of discrete R\nand non-R symmetries on the orbifold and on the resolved Calabi\u2013Yau. Finally, in Section 5\nwe conclude and give an outlook on future research directions.\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n1\n\nWe use the term omalous coined by Donagi for non-anomalous symmetries.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nAnomaly cancellation and universality\n\nIn this section we will briefly review anomalies and the Green\u2013Schwarz mechanism [3] (for a\nreview of anomaly cancellation in higher dimensions, see e.g. [22]), with particular emphasis\non ten- and four-dimensional supergravities derived from the heterotic string.\nAnomalies arise if a classical symmetry of a theory is not preserved under quantization.\nThis only happens for chiral fermions (and potentially other chiral fields, such as (anti)self-dual\ntensors, but these will not play a role in our discussion), and thus only in even dimensions d.\nIf the anomalous symmetry is a gauge symmetry, the theory is actually inconsistent.\nFor concreteness, consider a theory with a gauge group which is a product of a non-Abelian\ngroup G (where G can contain several factors) and a number of U (1)'s, and a set of massless\nchiral fermions f , transforming in representations r f of G and with U (1) charges qfi . In a\nFeynman diagram approach, anomalies arise via (d/2 + 1)-sided polygon graphs, with chiral\nfields in the loop. For example, in four dimensions the relevant diagram is a triangle, and\nwe can take all fields to be left-handed. Concentrating on the U (1) anomalies, we can attach\neither three U (1) gauge fields to the vertices, or one U (1) and two non-Abelian gauge fields,\nincluding gravitons (for the purpose of anomalies, we can basically treat the Lorentz group\nas another gauge group factor). The diagram leads to an anomalous divergence of the U (1)\ncurrent Ji ,\n1\n1\ne\u03bc\u03bd .\n\u2202\u03bc Ji\u03bc \u223c AG2 \u2212U (1)i tr F\u03bc\u03bd Fe\u03bc\u03bd +\nAU (1)3 Fj \u03bc\u03bd Fek\u03bc\u03bd + Agrav2 \u2212U (1)i tr R\u03bc\u03bd R\nijk\nsijk\n24\n\n(2.1)\n\nHere F , Fi and R are the field strengths of G, U (1)i and the Riemann tensor, the tilde denotes\nthe dual (i.e. Fe\u03bc\u03bd = 21 \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 F\u03c1\u03c3 ), and the traces are taken in a suitable representation. Finally,\nsijk is a symmetry factor taking into account permutations of the legs (i.e. for distinct i, j and\nk, we have siii = 3!, siij = 2! and sijk = 1). The anomaly coefficients for these cases are given\nby\nX\nX\nX\ni j k\nAG2 \u2212U (1) =\nqf l(r f ) ,\nAgrav2 \u2212U (1) =\nqm ,\nAU (1)3 =\nqm\nqm qm .\n(2.2)\nm\n\nf\n\nijk\n\nm\n\nHere the first sum runs over all chiral fermions f transforming in the representation r f of G,\nand l(r f ) is the quadratic index of r f . Similarly, the second and third sums run over all chiral\nfermions.\nThese coefficients have the same form for N anomalies, but they only have to vanish mod\nN (or mod N2 if N is even) to ensure consistency of the theory. Furthermore, it can be argued\nthat cubic discrete anomalies are not relevant for the discussion [23]. When considering R\nsymmetries, the charges in (2.2) have to be shifted by \u22121, since fermions run in the loop.\nAdditionally, for R symmetries the gauginos in the loop contribute a factor l(adjf ) to (2.2).\n\nZ\n\nA conceptually clearer approach to anomalies and their cancellation is via the anomaly\npolynomial. Here an anomaly manifests itself as non-invariance of the effective action \u0393 under\na gauge (or local Lorentz) transformation with parameter \u03bb,\n\u0393 \u2212\u2192 \u0393 + A(\u03bb) .\n3\n\n(2.3)\n\n\fSince the classical action is invariant, A arises from the path integral measure and can be\ncalculated e.g. by Fujikawa's method [24, 25] or as the index of a suitable Dirac operator [26].\nR (1)\nIt is given by an integral of a d-form, A = Id , and the Wess\u2013Zumino consistency conditions\nimply that the nontrivial information about the anomaly can be succinctly given in terms of a\n(formal) closed and gauge-invariant d+2-form Id+2 , which is related to Id via the Stora\u2013Zumino\ndescent equations\n(1)\n\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\n\u03b4\u03bb Id+1 = dId .\n\nId+2 = dId+1 ,\n\n(2.4)\n\nThe anomaly polynomial Id+2 is composed out of traces of powers of field strengths, including\n(0)\nthe Riemann tensor, treated as matrix-valued two-forms. The Id+1 are called Chern\u2013Simons\nforms.\nGenerically, if the anomaly is nonzero, the theory is inconsistent. However, if the anomalies\nare reducible, they can be canceled by the Green\u2013Schwarz mechanism. Reducible means that\nthe anomaly polynomial factorizes, i.e. it can be written as a sum\nId+2 =\n\nm\nX\n\nXd+2\u2212ka Yka ,\n\n(2.5)\n\na=1\n\nwhere each of the factors is by itself closed, gauge invariant and of even degree. (Throughout\nthis paper, the wedge product for forms is understood.) This in particular requires that terms\nsuch as tr F d/2+1 are absent for gauge groups which have a Casimir invariant of that order. The\nidea of the Green\u2013Schwarz mechanism is to compensate the variation of the effective action\nby an explicitly non-gauge invariant piece involving fields that transform with a shift. In a\nbottom-up approach, one may add these fields by hand, while in a top-down approach, such\nas string compactifications, these fields have to be present from the start.\nConcretely, a reducible anomaly of the form (2.5) requires a set of (ka \u2212 2)-form fields\nCka \u22122 , whose gauge transformation is a shift proportional to the descent of Yka ,\n(1)\n\n\u03b4Cka \u22122 = \u2212\u03beYka \u22122 .\n\n(2.6)\n\n(1)\n\nHere Yka \u22122 is the descent of the factor Yka in the anomaly polynomial, and \u03be is a free parameter.\nThis transformation implies that the field strength of Cka \u22122 contains the associated Chern\u2013\nSimons form,\n(0)\n\nHka \u22121 = dCka \u22122 + \u03beYka \u22121 ,\n\n(2.7)\n\nand consequently the Bianchi identity for Hka \u22121 becomes\ndHka \u22121 = \u03beYka .\n\n(2.8)\n\nThe anomalous variation (2.3) of the action is now canceled by the Green\u2013Schwarz action for\nthe form fields2 ,\nm Z\nX\n1\n1\nSGS =\n(2.9)\nHk \u22121 \u2227 \u2217Hka \u22121 + Cka \u22122 Xd+2\u2212ka .\n2 a\n\u03be\na=1\n\n2\n\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\nNote that there is in principle a third term \u223c Yka \u22121 Xd+1\u2212ka . The ambiguity arises because the anomaly\n(1)\nId can be a linear combination of the descents along Xd+2\u2212ka and Yka . We have made a particular choice here\nfor simplicity.\n\n4\n\n\fHence, each form field couples to some combination of gauge and gravitational field strengths\nencoded in Xd+2\u2212ka . It is, however, not required that the gauge group factors appear with\nuniversal coefficients in the coupling.\n(1)\nWe have phrased the previous discussion in terms of the Cka \u22122 with \u03b4Cka \u22122 = \u2212\u03beYka .\ned\u2212ka , for\nWe could just as well have described the mechanism in terms of the dual forms C\nwhich one has to switch the roles of X and Y . In particular, this dualization trades a coupling\ned\u2212k = \u2212X (1) .\nCka \u22122 \u2227 Xd+2\u2212ka for a shift \u03b4C\na\nd\u2212ka\nLet us now specialize to the case of interest, which are low-energy effective theories derived\nfrom the E8 \u00d7 E8 heterotic string. Here we have exactly one field which can take part in the\nGreen\u2013Schwarz mechanism, namely the Kalb\u2013Ramond two-form B2 , whose gauge transformation is fixed from string theory.\nIn ten dimensions, the low-energy theory is supergravity coupled to super-Yang\u2013Mills theory. The anomaly polynomial I12 receives contributions from the gravitino, the dilatino and\nthe gauginos, and the requirement of anomaly cancellation singles out SO(32) and E8 \u00d7 E8\nas the only consistent gauge groups. (Upon replacing one or both E8 's by U (1)248 , I12 still\nfactorizes, but the anomalies are not canceled as the U (1)'s appear in the transformation of\nB2 but not in the anomaly polynomial [27].)\nThe anomaly polynomial factorizes as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n4\n2\n2\n4\n2 2\n2 2\nI12 = Y8 X4 =\ntr R +\ntr F \u2212\ntr R\n\u2212 tr R tr F +\ntr F\n8\n32\n8\n24\n8\n(2.10)\n\u0001\n2\n2\n\u00d7 tr R \u2212 tr F .\n\nHere R and F denote the ten-dimensional Riemann and field strength tensors. For the E8 \u00d7 E8\ntheory, F = F\u2032 \u2295 F\u2032\u2032 , and the corresponding traces are sums of the terms for the two E8 's.\nExplicitly, the two-form B2 transforms as\n\u03b4B2 = tr \u0398d\u03a9 \u2212 tr \u03bb\u2032 dA\u2032 \u2212 tr \u03bb\u2032\u2032 dA\u2032\u2032 ,\n\n(2.11)\n\nwhere \u03a9, A\u2032 and A\u2032\u2032 are spin and gauge connections and \u0398, \u03bb\u2032 and \u03bb\u2032\u2032 are the corresponding\ntransformation parameters. The associated Chern\u2013Simons three-forms are\n\u03c93\u2032 = tr A\u2032 dA\u2032 \u2212\n\n2i \u20323\nA\n3\n\n(2.12)\n\nand similar for the other connections.\nP\nFor four-dimensional theories, factorizable anomalies can only take the form I6 = a Y2a X4a ,\nand can thus be canceled by two-forms or scalars (axions). Since in four dimensions, these are\ndual to each other (in the sense that their field strengths satisfy \u2217H3 = H1 ), we can phrase\nthe following discussion in terms of scalars only. The two-form Y2 can only be a field strength\nof a U (1) gauge group factor, Y2 = dA1 . If such a factor appears, we call the U (1) anomalous,\nwhile U (1) factors which do not appear in this way are called omalous. Then X4 involves\nthe anomalous U (1) and either two more U (1)'s or a square of a non-Abelian group (again\nincluding gravity), and by an abuse of notation we denote these as Abelian, non-Abelian and\ngravitational anomalies, respectively.\n5\n\n\fIf the axion C0 cancels the anomaly, its field strength (2.7) becomes\nH1 = dC0 + \u03beA1 ,\n\n(2.13)\n\nand thus the kinetic term for C0 leads to a mass term \u223c \u03be 2 |A1 |2 . Thus, an anomalous U (1)\ngets a St\u00fcckelberg mass from the Green\u2013Schwarz axion, which can be gauged away and \"eaten\"\nby A1 .\nFor heterotic d = 4 models, we investigate two cases: Compactifications on orbifolds and\non smooth Calabi\u2013Yaus with vector bundles, including orbifold blowups3 . In the first case,\nthe only field able to cancel anomalies is the four-dimensional two-form b2 coming from the\nreduction of B2 , while neither twisted nor untwisted sectors contain fields that transform with\na shift. Hence I6 factorizes into a single product, I6 = X4 Y2 . Furthermore, X4 is simply given\nby the second line of Eq. (2.10), restricted to four-dimensional forms and the unbroken gauge\ngroup. Upon dualizing b2 to an axion a, the anomaly is canceled by the coupling\nZ\na X4 ,\n(2.14)\nso in particular a couples universally to all gauge groups. Note that this coupling arises in\nthe dualization as a consequence of the gauge transformation properties of b2 , so it is actually\nindependent of the existence of an anomalous U (1), which manifests itself as a shift of a under\nthe anomalous symmetry. Furthermore, if one E8 is unbroken, there will be no matter states\ncharged under this E8 and consequently no mixed anomaly to cancel. Hence the coupling (2.14)\ncannot produce a gauge variation, and there is no anomalous U (1) in this case.\nIn the second case, there will generically be many additional axions \u03b2r arising from the\nreduction of B2 along internal cohomology two-forms Er . Their transformation follows from\nEq. (2.11) by expanding the internal flux and comparing the terms proportional to Er . Hence\nthese axions will not couple universally to all gauge groups (otherwise one could redefine them\nby a term proportional to the universal axion). So in this setup, there can be up to 16\nanomalous U (1)'s, at most one of which couples universally. Note further that if an axion\nshifts under a U (1), the gauge boson is massive by its field strength (2.13) even if the U (1) is\nomalous.\nIn particular, for a compactification on a Calabi\u2013Yau X with line bundles, the anomaly\npolynomial can be evaluated easily: Split the 10d gauge fields into internal background flux\nand four-dimensional fluctuations, F = F + F , R = R + R. Here we assume that the fourdimensional backgrounds vanish and that there are no massless internal fluctuations. The\nbackgrounds satisfy the Bianchi identity\n2\n\n2\n\ndH = tr R2 \u2212 tr F \u2032 \u2212 tr F \u2032\u2032 = 0\n\n(2.15)\n\nin cohomology, i.e. tr R2 \u2212 tr F \u2032 2 \u2212 tr F \u2032\u2032 2 is an exact form that vanishes when integrated over\nany closed four-cycle. Then one can straightforwardly insert this split into the ten-dimensional\n3\n\nFor the question of localized anomalies on orbifold fixed points, see e.g. [28, 29].\n\n6\n\n\fanomaly polynomial4 (2.10) and keep the terms cubic in the backgrounds to get [14, 30]\nZ \u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0001\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\u2032 \u2032 2\n2\n\u20322\ntr\nF\nF\n+\ntr\nR\nI6 =\ntr\nF\n\u2212\ntr F \u20322\n(2\u03c0)6\n6\n4\n2\nX\n(2.16)\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1\n5\n\u2212\ntr R2 tr R2 tr F \u2032 F \u2032 + F \u2032 , F \u2032 \u2194 F \u2032\u2032 , F \u2032\u2032\ntr F \u20322 \u2212\n8\n12\nEach E8 contributes three terms:\nR\n\u2022 X tr(F \u2032 F \u2032 )2 * tr(F \u2032 F \u2032 ) gives rise to Abelian anomalies only. This is true also for bundles\nwith non-Abelian structure group H because the generators of H, for which the trace\ngives a nonvanishing contribution, are broken by the bundle.\n\u0001\nR\n\u2022 X tr F \u20322 \u2212 21 tr R2 tr F \u20322 * tr(F \u2032 F \u2032 ) gives Abelian and non-Abelian anomalies, and\n\u0001\nR\n5\ntr R2 tr R2 * tr(F \u2032 F \u2032 ) leads to gravitational anomalies.\n\u2022 X tr F \u20322 \u2212 12\n\nSo we see that there is some partial anomaly universality: The non-Abelian anomalies coming\nout of the first E8 are captured by one anomalous U (1) factor with universal coefficients,\nand similar for the second E8 . Furthermore, if one E8 is unbroken, i.e. F \u2032\u2032 = 0, the Bianchi\nidentity (2.15) implies that the non-Abelian and gravitational anomalies are captured by the\nsame U (1), and their coefficients are proportional to each other.\n\n3\n\nModels with non-universal anomalies\n\n3.1\n\nBottom-up model\n\nAs a simple example of a model which does not require anomaly universality, consider an\nextension of the MSSM by an additional U (1)X . Here, the anomaly coefficients depend on\nthe U (1)X charges of the MSSM superfields, i.e. on the phenomenological requirements one\nimposes. Demanding e.g. that the U (1)X charges allow the MSSM Yukawa couplings and\nthe Weinberg operator, are flavor-blind and commute with SU (5) for matter, we obtain the\nconstraints\n2q10 + qHu = 2R ,\n\n(3.1a)\n\nq10 + q5\u0304 + qHd = 2R ,\n\n(3.1b)\n\n2q5\u0304 + 2qHu = 2R ,\n\n(3.1c)\n\nwhere R = 0 or R = 1 distinguishes non-R and R symmetries. Assuming no light Higgs\ntriplets, one thus finds for the anomalies\n3\n(3q10 + q5\u0304 ) \u2212 3R ,\n2\n= (3q10 + q5\u0304 ) \u2212 3R ,\n9\n3\n= (3q10 + q5\u0304 ) \u2212 R .\n5\n2\n\nASU (3)2 \u2212U (1)X =\n\n(3.2a)\n\nASU (2)2 \u2212U (1)X\n\n(3.2b)\n\nAU (1)2 \u2212U (1)X\nY\n\n4\n\n(3.2c)\n\nSince there are no purely gravitational anomalies in four dimensions, one can restrict to the gaugino contributions, as the gravitino and dilatino anomalies only involve the Riemann tensor.\n\n7\n\n\f\u0001\nWe use the conventions l(N ) = 21 and l adjf = N for SU (N ). Furthermore, while generically U (1) normalizations in a bottom-up approach are not fixed, we use the GUT normalization for the hypercharge U (1)Y . Clearly, imposing anomaly universality is a strong\nadditional constraint. This constraint is neither required for consistency (as was discussed\nin Chapter 2), nor particularly motivated from grand unification:\nAssuming an\nSU (5)\u00d7U (1)X theory at some high scale, after the breaking to the MSSM we might expect that\nASU (3)2 \u2212U (1)X = ASU (2)2 \u2212U (1)X . However, this only holds\n\u2022 for non-R symmetries, since for R symmetries, the gauginos contribute a non-universal\n\u0001\nfactor l adjf ,\n\n\u2022 and before doublet-triplet splitting, as removing the triplets will change ASU (3)2 \u2212U (1)X\nbut not ASU (2)2 \u2212U (1)X (unless qHu + qHd \u2212 2R = 0, in which case the \u03bc term is not\nforbidden).\n\nFrom this it also follows that if the anomaly was universal before doublet\u2013triplet splitting, it\nwill not be afterwards and vice versa.\nThe situation is analogous for the case of a N instead of U (1)X . In that case, (3.1) has\nto be satisfied only mod N and the anomaly coefficients are only defined mod N or mod N2 ,\ndepending on whether N is odd or even.\n\nZ\n\nThis discussion illustrates that anomaly universality leads to unnecessary constraints on\npotential U (1)X or N symmetries. In particular, (3.1) implies\n\nZ\n\n2 (qHu + qHd ) = 10(R \u2212 q10 ) mod N ,\n\n(3.3)\n\nand thus the \u03bc term can be forbidden by both R and non-R symmetries once anomaly universality is not imposed.\n\n3.2\n\nString model\n\nNow we want to construct an explicit string-derived realization illustrating the arguments made\nin Chapter 2. We consider a model on the T 6 / 3 orbifold in E8 \u00d7 E8 heterotic string theory.\nIn the orbifold standard embedding with shift vector\n\nZ\n\nV =\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1\n1, 1, \u22122, 05 08\n3\n\n(3.4)\n\nand without Wilson lines, the gauge group is broken to E6 \u00d7 SU (3) \u00d7 E8 . In particular, there\nis no anomalous U (1). The orbifold action \u03b8 on the three two-tori with complex coordinates\nzi is defined as\n\u03b8 : zi \u2192 e2\u03c0ivi zi ,\n\nv = (1, 1, \u22122) ,\n\n(3.5)\n\nand has 27 fixed points. The massless chiral spectrum is given by\n\u0001\n\u0002\n\u0003\n3 27, 3, 1 + 27 (27, 1, 1) + 3 (1, 3, 1) .\n8\n\n(3.6)\n\n\fIn order to construct a blowup, we replace the fixed points of the orbifold by 27 exceptional divisors E\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 \u2261 Er , where \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 = 1 . . . 3 label the fixed points on the three tori and r = 1 . . . 27.\nThe Abelian gauge flux, which is supported at the exceptional divisors only, is of the form\nF = Er VrI HI , where HI denotes the elements of the Cartan subalgebra of E8 \u00d7 E8 . The\nbundle vectors VrI are chosen to coincide with shifted momenta of twisted orbifold states. In\nour case they read\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1\n2, 2, 2, 0, 04 08 ,\n3\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1\nV2 =\n\u22121, \u22121, \u22121, 3, 04 08 ,\n3\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1\nV3 =\n\u22121, \u22121, \u22121, \u22123, 04 08 .\n3\nV1 =\n\n(3.7a)\n(3.7b)\n(3.7c)\n\nWe assign V1 to the first k fixed points, V2 to the next p fixed points and V3 to the remaining\nq = 27 \u2212 k \u2212 p ones. The blowup procedure in the field theory picture corresponds to giving\na vev to the twisted states with shifted momenta (3.7). For details on the blowup procedure,\nsee e.g. [9, 30, 31].\nThe bundle vectors have to satisfy three consistency conditions: The flux quantization\ncondition, the Bianchi identity and the Donaldson\u2013Uhlenbeck\u2013Yau (DUY) equations. Since\nthe bundle vectors are given by shifted momenta of the twisted states (27, 1, 1), the flux\nquantization condition 3VrI \u2208 \u039bE8 \u00d7E8 is automatically fulfilled. It is also easy to check that\nthe Bianchi identity Vr2 = 43 is fulfilled as well. The DUY equations read\nZ\nZ\nX\n1\n1\nJ \u2227J \u2227F =\nJ \u2227 J \u2227 Er VrI HI =\nvol(Er )Vr ,\n(3.8)\n0=\n2\n2\nr\nX\n\nX\n\nwhere J = ai Ri \u2212 br Er denotes the K\u00e4hler form and vol(Er ) > 0 in the K\u00e4hler cone a \u226b b > 0.\nCondition (3.8) can be fulfilled for all configurations (k, p, q) with arbitrarily large exceptional\ndivisor volumes: The DUY equations can be written as\nk\nX\n\nvol(Er ) * V1 +\n\nr=1\n\nk+p\nX\n\nvol(Er ) * V2 +\n\nr=k+1\n\nk+p+q\nX\n\nvol(Er ) * V3 = 0 .\n\n(3.9)\n\nr=k+p+1\n\nSince in our model the bundle vectors add up to zero, this simplifies to the condition\nk\nX\n\nvol(Er ) =\n\nr=1\n\nk+p\nX\n\nvol(Er ) =\n\nr=k+1\n\nk+p+q\nX\n\nvol(Er ) .\n\n(3.10)\n\nr=k+p+1\n\nEach of the bundle vectors in Eq. (3.7) breaks E6 to a differently embedded SO(10) \u00d7 U (1),\nbut only two breakings are independent. We are thus left with the gauge group\nG = SO(8) \u00d7 U (1)A \u00d7 U (1)B \u00d7 SU (3) \u00d7 E8 .\n\n(3.11)\n\nThe two U (1) factors are generated by\ntA = 2, 2, 2, 0, 04\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0001\n08 ,\n\ntB = 0, 0, 0, 2, 04\n9\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0001\n08 .\n\n(3.12)\n\n\fUsing this normalization, all charges are integer. The U (1) generators are related to the bundle\nvectors (3.7) via\nV1 =\n\n1\ntA ,\n3\n\n1\n1\nV2 = \u2212 t A + t B ,\n6\n2\n\n1\n1\nV3 = \u2212 t A \u2212 t B .\n6\n2\n\n(3.13)\n\nThe induced decomposition of the 27 (via SO(10) \u00d7 U (1)) is\n27 \u2212\u2192 161 + 10\u22122 + 14\n\u2212\u2192 (8s )1,\u22121 + (8c )1,1 + (8v )\u22122,0 + 1\u22122,\u22122 + 1\u22122,2 + 14,0 .\n\n(3.14)\n\nThe 3 bundle vectors (3.7) on the Calabi\u2013Yau side correspond on the orbifold side to a vev of the\n3 singlets in (3.14). The massless chiral spectrum on the blowup depends on the distribution\n(k, p, q) of the bundle vectors over the 27 fixed points. The untwisted sector and the twisted\n(1, 3)'s in the orbifold spectrum (3.6) always contribute 72 * (1, 3) and 9 * (8, 3), while some of\nthe twisted 8's get massive or vector-like. As a result, we get\n(p \u2212 q) * (8v , 1) + (k \u2212 q) * (8s , 1) + (k \u2212 p) * (8c , 1) .\n\n(3.15)\n\nFurthermore, the U (1) charges of the states from the twisted sector will be shifted by the\ncharges of the blowup modes at the respective fixed point. The blowup mode at the r-th fixed\npoint is redefined as\n\u03a6BU-Mode\n= ebr +i\u03b2r ,\nr\n\n(3.16)\n\nwhere br are the K\u00e4hler (size) moduli of the r-th blowup cycle dual to Er , and \u03b2r are the\nlocalized axions. In addition, the twisted orbifold states \u03a6Orb get redefined as\nOrb\n\u03a6BU\n* e\u2212(br +i\u03b2r ) .\nr =\u03a6\n\n(3.17)\n\nWith this, the U (1) charges of the blowup states are given by\nq(\u03a6BU ) = q(\u03a6Orb ) \u2212 q(\u03a6BU-Mode ) .\n\n(3.18)\n\nFor a detailed discussion of this redefinition procedure and a complete match of the orbifold\nand blowup spectra, see [15, 16].\n3.2.1\n\nAnomaly coefficients\n\nOnce the spectrum on the blowup is determined, we can calculate the anomaly coefficients\nof U (1)A and U (1)B via the corresponding triangle graphs using (2.2). As an important\nconsistency check, the result can be compared with the coefficients appearing in the 4d anomaly\npolynomial (2.16).\nFrom the structure of the anomaly polynomial we draw a number of conclusions: First we\ntake (2.16) for the first E8 (and hence drop the primes on all field strengths) and express it in\nterms of the second Chern class c2 as follows\n\u0015\nZ \u0014\n1\n1\n7\n1\n2\n2\n2\nI6 =\ntr(FF ) \u2212 c2 tr F + c2 tr R tr(FF ) .\n(3.19)\n(2\u03c0)6\n6\n4\n48\nX\n\n10\n\n\fHere we have used that tr R2 = \u22122c2 and tr F 2 = tr R2 in cohomology, as long as the second\nE8 remains unbroken. We expand the flux and the 4d field strength as F = Er VrI HI and\nF = F I HI and insert k times the contribution from V1 , p times the contribution from V2 and\nq times the contribution of V3 to obtain\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nk\u22126\nk \u2212 18\n3\n2\nI6 \u223c FA *\n+ FA FB *\n12\n4\n\u0015 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0014\nk\u22129\n7\n2\n2\n2\ntr R *\n(3.20)\n+ FA tr FSU (3) + tr FSO(8) \u2212\n12\n2\n\u0014\n\u0015 \u0012\n\u0013\n1 2\n1 2\n7\np\u2212q\n2\n2\n2\n+ FB\nF + F + tr FSU (3) + tr FSO(8) \u2212\ntr R *\n.\n8 B 48 A\n12\n2\nR\nP\nWe have also used relations (3.13) and X c2 Er VrI FI = \u22126 r VrI FI . From (3.20) it is evident\nthat U (1)B is omalous if p = q, that the cubic U (1)A anomaly vanishes for k = 6, and that\nthe non-Abelian anomalies of U (1)A vanish for k = 9. In particular, there is no configuration\nwith omalous U (1)A .\nAlthough U (1)B is omalous in some bundle configurations, both U (1)'s are always massive. The axion associated with U (1)B always feels a shift proportional to \u03bb due to the\ntransformation (2.11) and hence gets a mass via the St\u00fcckelberg mechanism. We expand\nB2 = b2 + \u03b1i Ri \u2212 \u03b2r Er to see from (2.11) that \u03b2r transforms as\n\u03b4\u03b2r = tr \u03bbVr ,\n\n(3.21)\n\nwhile the \u03b1i do not play a role in this case. Therefore the anomalies in our model are canceled\nby the non-universal axions \u03b2r only. There can be no contribution from the universal b2 because\nof the absence of an anomalous U (1) on the orbifold. In particular, (3.13) indicates that the\nfirst k of the \u03b2r cancel the anomalies of U (1)A and the rest cancel a mixture of both U (1)'s.\nHence the axions can be redefined such that only two of the 1 + 27 possible axions transform\nwith a shift, and the others are invariant under (2.3).\nAnother way to see that both U (1)'s are massive is by looking at the mass term for the 4d\ngauge bosons arising from the action (2.9)\nZ\n\u0001IJ\nH3 \u2227 \u2217H3 = AI\u03bc A\u03bc J M 2\n+ *** ,\n(3.22)\nX\n\nwith the mass matrix\nM2\n\n\u0001IJ\n\n= VrI VsJ *\n\nZ\n\nEr \u2227 \u22176 Es .\n\n(3.23)\n\nX\n\nHere, \u22176 denotes the six-dimensional Hodge star.

Their spectra and anomaly coefficients are summarized in Table 1(a) and 1(b),\nrespectively. Model 1 has the configuration (k, p, q) = (9, 9, 9). As explained before, U (1)B is\nomalous and U (1)A only has Abelian anomalies. Model 2 has (k, p, q) = (25, 1, 1). Here, U (1)B\nis still omalous and U (1)A has Abelian and non-Abelian anomalies. Model 3 with configuration\n(k, p, q) = (13, 13, 1) is the most general, where all anomaly coefficients are nonzero.\n\n12\n\n\fIn all models the anomaly coefficients from the triangle diagrams and from the anomaly\npolynomials match. All models exhibit Green\u2013Schwarz anomaly cancellation with non-universal\naxions.\n\n4\n\nRemnant discrete symmetries\n\nDiscrete symmetries are very useful for explaining the absence of a perturbative \u03bc term and of\ndimension-four and five proton decay operators. While discrete non-R symmetries often stem\nfrom broken U (1) symmetries, discrete R symmetries arise as remnants of the internal Lorentz\nsymmetry after compactification.\n\n4.1\n\nNon-R symmetries\n\nSince the blowup is generated from twisted orbifold fields that get a vev, discrete symmetries\ncan arise from remnants of the U (1) gauge groups under which the blowup fields were charged.\nIn the family of models at hand, the discrete non-R symmetries are the ones left over from\nthe two broken U (1)'s. One finds from the branching of the 27 of E6 in (3.14) that the bundle\nvectors (3.7) correspond to the blowup modes\n(1, 1)4,0 ,\nWhen these get a vev, a\nare omalous.\n\n4.2\n\n(1, 1)\u22122,\u22122 ,\n\n(1, 1)\u22122,2 .\n\n(4.1)\n\nZ2 \u00d7 Z2 subgroup survives5. It is easy to check that both Z2 factors\n\nR symmetries\n\nThe discussion of remnant R symmetries is more involved. R symmetries are those transformations that do not commute with supersymmetry, which in superspace language means that\nthe Grassmann coordinate \u03b8 transforms nontrivially. Since there is only one such coordinate\nin 4d N = 1 supersymmetry, this can at most be a single U (1) or N : If there are several such\nsymmetries, they can be redefined such that only one of them transforms \u03b8, while the others\nact as usual non-R symmetries. The normalization is commonly chosen such that \u03b8 transforms\nwith charge 1, which implies that the superpotential W has charge 2. This convention only\nfixes the charges of the fields up to an admixture of non-R symmetries that leave \u03b8 invariant.\nFurthermore, a 2 R symmetry can be turned into a non-R symmetry by a combination with\na sign reversal on the fermions, so 2 symmetries do not lead to true R symmetries.\nIn the following, we begin with reviewing R symmetries from the orbifold point of view.\nAfter that, we discuss them from the Calabi\u2013Yau perspective.\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n4.2.1\n\nZ\n\nR symmetries on the orbifold\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nThe orbifold (T 2 )3 / 3 possesses a discrete ( 3 )3 rotational symmetry stemming from rotating\neach torus independently by 2\u03c0i\n3 (note that this is a symmetry of the compactification space\n5\n\nGenerically, this is a\n\nZ4 's.\n\nZ4 \u00d7 Z4 .\n\nIn our family of models however, all states have charge 0 or 2 under both\n\n13\n\n\fbut not an orbifold space group element). In the literature [33], one often finds the R charge\nof the orbifold state defined as\ni\nei + N\ne\u2217 i .\nRi = qsh\n\u2212N\n\n(4.2)\n\nHere, qsh is the shifted SO(8) momentum of the right-movers in light-cone gauge (sometimes\ne i and N\ne \u2217 i are integer oscillator numbers. The combination of\ncalled H-momentum), and the N\nthe oscillators is such that the Ri are invariant under picture changing. The R charges of the\n\b\nf = q \u2212 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , and hence\nspace-time fermions are related to the above R charges via qsh\nsh\n2 2 2 2\nRfi = Ri \u2212 12 . R charge conservation requires that for a superpotential coupling involving L\nchiral superfields \u03a6\u03b1 , W \u2283 \u03a61 * * * \u03a6L , the charges satisfy\nL\nX\n\nR\u03b1i \u2261 1 mod Ni ,\n\ni = 1, 2, 3 .\n\n(4.3)\n\n\u03b1=1\n\nHere Ni is the order of the orbifold twist in the ith torus. It should be noted that in this\nconvention the superpotential W has R charge 1 and thus \u03b8 has R charge 12 .\nIn cases where rotating a sub-torus independently by 2\u03c0i\nNi is a symmetry, an orbifold state\n\u03a6 transforms as\nR : \u03a6 \u2192 e2\u03c0iv*R \u03a6\n\n(4.4)\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nwith v = 0, N11 , 0, 0 and similarly for the other sublattice rotations. Explicitly, this transformation acts in the following way:\n\u2022 The bosonic R charge from (4.2) is quantized in units of\nphase e\n\n2\u03c0i\nN2\ni\n\n1\nNi ,\n\nso under (4.4) bosons get a\n\n.\n2\u03c0i\n\n\u2022 The R charges of the fermions is shifted by \u2212 12 , so \u03b8 transforms with a phase e 2Ni , i.e.\nsublattice rotations act as a 2Ni R symmetry.\n\nZ\n\n\u2022 Finally, the order of (4.4) acting on the fermions is given by the least common multiple\nof Ni2 and 2Ni .\n\nZ\n\nTo summarize, the R transformations form a 2N 2 symmetry, under which the charges of\ni\nbosons, fermions and \u03b8 are of the form 2k, 2k \u2212 N and N , respectively, where k is an integer.\nIf N is even, so are all charges, and consequently, only a N 2 is realized on the fields.\n\nZ\n\ni\n\nOwing to this slightly confusing symmetry pattern, one finds at least 3 different R charge\nnormalizations in the literature:\n1. W has charge 1, and the smallest charge quantization is in units of\nby the orbifold R rule (4.3).\n\n1\n2Ni .\n\n2.

Note that in\nparticular the twisted states \u03a6 corresponding to the 27 of E6 have R = 31 (0, 1, 1, 1) and thus\ntransform with charge 19 under each 3 sublattice rotation. Clearly, this is not a bona fide\n6 symmetry because applying it six times does not give the identity of the fields, but it fits\nwith the standard R symmetry normalization from four-dimensional supersymmetry, and the\norbifold R charge conservation (4.3) becomes a mod 6 condition.\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n4.2.2\n\nR symmetries from the blowup perspective\n\nTo find unbroken R symmetries after switching on vevs to generate the blowup, we seek\ncombinations of the three sublattice rotations Ri and the two U (1) generators TA,B which\nleave the blowup modes invariant,\nA\n\nB\n\n1qA ,qB \u2212\u2192 (R1 )r (R2 )s (R3 )t (TA )q (TB )q 1qA ,qB = 1qA ,qB ,\n\n(4.5)\n\nfor (qA , qB ) = (4, 0), (\u22122, 2) and (\u22122, \u22122). This implies that r + s + t \u2261 0 mod 3, i.e. only a\ntrivial 2 R symmetry remains. Note that by combining with discrete non-R N symmetries,\nhigher N R symmetries (with N > 3) can be obtained. For the examples presented here, the\ndiscrete non-R symmetries are 2 \u00d7 2 , such that in this case no R symmetry enhancement\nby mixing in other symmetries is possible. Hence for the models at hand it is expected that\nno nontrivial R symmetry will be left after blowing up. However, as discussed in Section 3.1,\nboth R and non-R symmetries can forbid the unwanted superpotential terms once anomaly\nuniversality is not required.\nWe will now investigate how to reproduce this from the perspective of the resolution space.\nOne way to uncover discrete R symmetries on the resolution Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds is to look at\nthe GLSM realization. For the sake of clarity, we focus on the (k, p, q) = (9, 9, 9) model, where\nthe blowup can be described with just three exceptional divisors. However, using the results\nfrom [12], the analysis can be repeated for more general configurations and for other orbifolds\nin the same fashion. We leave the full analysis including more realistic cases for future work\nand merely outline the procedure.\n\nZ\nZ\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n15\n\n\fP\n\nZ\n\n\u0001\n2 [3] 3 /\nThe geometry is realized as the blowup of a complete intersection in\n3 . The\ncoordinates and charges for the GLSM realization are given in Table 2. The orbifold twist acts\n2\u03c0i\nwith a phase e 3 on z11 , z21 and z31 . From this and Table 2, one derives the F -term equations\nfor the ci\n3\n3\n3\n0 = z11\nx111 + z12\nx211 + z13\nx311 ,\n\n(4.6a)\n\n3\n3\n3\n0 = z21\nx111 x211 x311 + z22\n+ z23\n,\n\n(4.6b)\n\n3\n3\n3\n0 = z31\nx111 x211 x311 + z32\n+ z33\n,\n\n(4.6c)\n\nspecifying the complete intersection, and the D-term equations\n|z1\u03b1 |2 + |z21 |2 + |z31 |2 \u2212 3|x\u03b111 |2 = b\u03b111 ,\n3\nX\n\n|zi\u03c1 |2 = ai ,\n\n\u03b1 \u2208 {1, 2, 3} ,\n\n(4.7a)\n\ni \u2208 {1, 2, 3} ,\n\n(4.7b)\n\n\u03c1=1\n\nspecifying the geometric phase (the vevs of the ci have already been set to zero). The zi\u03c1\ncorrespond to the inherited divisors, where i = 1, 2, 3 labels the torus and \u03c1 = 1, 2, 3 labels the\nfixed point. The three coordinates x\u03b111 label the three exceptional divisors where each resolves\n9 of the 27 orbifold fixed points. Finally, the FI parameters ai and b\u03b111 are related to the sizes\nof the tori and the exceptional divisors, respectively. We have chosen a phase where ai \u226b 0\nand ai \u226b b\u03b111 . For b\u03b111 \u226b 0, one uncovers the blowup regime, while b\u03b111 \u2192 \u2212\u221e yields the\norbifold regime. (The notation has been chosen as in [12].)\nTo find R symmetries in this picture, we have to find holomorphic automorphisms of the\nambient space which leave (4.6) and (4.7) invariant, and under which the holomorphic (3, 0)\u2013\nform \u03a9 transforms nontrivially [34]. This is true because \u03a9 is related to the four-dimensional\nSUSY generators via the internal spinor \u03b7 by \u03a9ijk = \u03b7 T \u0393ijk \u03b7, where \u0393ijk is a product of 3\ngamma matrices. \u03a9 can acquire at most a phase \u03b3 = e2\u03c0i\u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2208 , i.e. \u03a9 7\u2192 \u03b3\u03a9. This means\n1\nthat \u03b7 \u2192 \u00b1\u03b3 2 and thus the superpotential W transforms as W \u2192 \u03b3W , i.e. like \u03a9. On the\norbifold, the twisted 273 coupling is allowed, so the 27 of E6 has to transform with a phase\n1\n\u03b33.\nIn our case, we find that the F - and D-term constraints are invariant under the 3 transformations6\n\nR\n\nZ\n\nzi\u03b1 \u2192 e\nFurthermore, there is the\n\n2\u03c0i\n*ki\u03b1\n3\n\nzi\u03b1\n\n\u2200 i, \u03b1 .\n\n(4.8)\n\nZ3 symmetry\n(x111 , x211 , x311 ) \u2192 e\n\n2\u03c0i\n*k\n3\n\n(x111 , x211 , x311 ) .\n\n(4.9)\n\nIt should be noted that the presence of these symmetries is inherited from the symmetries of\nthe orbifold.

Thus \u03b3 = e 3\n2\u03c0i\nand the 27 of E6 transforms with e 9 , which reproduces the quantization in multiples of 19\nfrom the orbifold.\nSo far, we have used the GLSM merely as a book-keeping device to realize the geometry\nof the blowup space, but it contains more information. In particular, from the preceding\ndiscussion it seems that the 3 symmetries (4.9) cannot be broken in the GLSM, since the\nzi\u03b1 appear only cubed or as absolute values. This seems puzzling, since all R symmetries are\ngenerically broken from the orbifold point of view. On the other hand, from the GLSM point\nof view the 3 symmetries are merely accidental symmetries, and we would expect them to be\nbroken by quantum effects. However, up to now we have not incorporated the gauge bundle\ninto the GLSM description. To make contact to the blowup model, we consider the line bundle\nL = O(0, 0, 0, 2, \u22121, \u22121) 3 \u2295 O(0, 0, 0, 0, 3, \u22123) in analogy to the blowup modes (3.7). The\nchiral spectrum is then given by various line bundle cohomology groups (see Table 3). Using\ncohomCalg [35, 36] we can reproduce the chiral spectrum of the (9, 9, 9) model in Table 1(a),\nwhich is in turn consistent with the orbifold picture.\nThe transformation of the states under the discrete symmetries can also be calculated\nvia cohomCalg. Starting from the symmetries (4.8) and (4.9), which are given in terms of\ntheir actions on the GLSM coordinates, we have to determine how they act on the respective\ncohomologies of our bundle restricted to the Calabi\u2013Yau hypersurface. A priori, it is not clear\nthat the restriction of the symmetry to the Calabi\u2013Yau can be lifted to the gauge bundle. A lift\nof the discrete symmetry to the gauge bundle which is consistent with the bundle projection\nand which preserves the group action is known as an equivariant structure [20, 37]. It can\nbe shown that for M symmetries all line bundles admit an equivariant structure.

The monomials for N4a and N a4 can be obtained from Nab by permutations\nof indices.\n\nequivariant structure, we have to check how the relevant bundle cohomologies transform. As\nin the case of the chiral spectrum, this is done by relating the gauge bundle on the Calabi\u2013Yau\nto the gauge bundle of the ambient space via the Koszul resolution. The transformation of\nthe matter states is then given in terms of the action of the symmetry on the global sections7\nof the gauge bundle, which are given by polynomials in the homogeneous coordinates of the\nambient space.\nAlthough the massless chiral spectra obtained from the orbifold, the blowup, and the GLSM\nperspective match, using the bundle L together with the geometric data of Table 2 seems to\nlead to U (1) anomalies in the GLSM. Recently, a mechanism has been proposed how these\nanomalies can be canceled [38, 39]. A discussion of this is, however, beyond the scope of the\npaper.\nInstead, we want to resort to the non-compact 3 / 3 orbifold, where a consistent connection between the orbifold and the GLSM bundle description is known [11]. The bundle is\n\u02c6\ndescribed by chiral-Fermi multiplets \u039bI , I\u02c6 = 1, . . . , 16, which correspond to the Cartan subal\u02c6\ngebra of E8 \u00d7 E8 . The \u039bI are charged under the exceptional symmetries E\u03b111 , with charges\ngiven by the line bundle vectors (3.7) corresponding to the orbifold shifted momenta. Now the\ncoordinates show up when determining the charged spectrum [11]: The massless target space\n\u02c6\nmodes \u03c64d (x\u03bc ) appear as deformations of the GLSM kinetic terms for the \u039bI as\nZ\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\n\u02c6 \u02c6\nd2 \u03b8 + \u03c64d NI\u02c6J (zi\u03b1 , x\u03b111 ) \u039bI \u039bJ\u02c6 + \u03c6\u20324d NI\u02c6J\u02c6(zi\u03b1 , x\u03b111 ) \u039bI \u039bJ + h.c.\n(4.12)\n\nC Z\n\n\u02c6\u02c6\n\n\u02c6\n\nHere the N I J and NI\u02c6J denote polynomials in the coordinate fields which are chosen such that\nthe expression is gauge invariant. Note that this is a K\u00e4hler potential term, so the N 's need\nnot be holomorphic.\n7\n\nIf the bundle is not globally generated, one can twist it by an equivariant ample line bundle and check the\ntransformation for the twisted bundle.\n\n18\n\n\fWhile locally at each fixed point the gauge group is SU (3)\u00d7 SO(10)\u00d7 U (1)\u00d7 E8 , the global\n2\nmodel in the end has \u0010gauge group\n\u0011 SU (3) \u00d7 SO(8) \u00d7 U (1) \u00d7 E8 . With regard to this, we split\nthe index I\u02c6 into I\u02c6 = a, 4, I, J \u0303 with a = 1, 2, 3, I = 5, . . . , 8. Furthermore, J \u0303 corresponds to\nthe second E8 which is unbroken and hence omitted in the following discussion. The gauge\nfields are determined by the neutral deformations Nab and N44 for SU (3) \u00d7 U (1)2 and NIJ and\nNIJ for SO(8). We can also read off the charged spectrum from the coefficients: Nab , N4a\n\u0001\n\u0001\nand N a4 correspond to 1, 3 and (1, 3), NaI and NaI correspond to 8, 3 , and N4I and N4I\ncorrespond to (8, 1). The relevant charges of the bundle and the resulting polynomial charges\nare summarized in Table 4(a). Some of the contributing monomials are given in Table 4(b).\nNote that the charges of the N 's reproduce some of the line bundle charges of Table 3, but not\nall of them: The missing ones correspond to spinorial roots of E8 which are not captured in\nthe outlined procedure. Generically, the presence of the N 's in (4.12) breaks at least some of\nthe discussed 3 symmetries. However, a more thorough understanding of these deformations\nis needed, e.g. as to which monomials actually contribute in a given phase: Depending on\nthe K\u00e4hler parameters, certain coordinates may or may not vanish, and this will play a role\nin determining the appearing operators, and hence the symmetry breaking. In particular, we\nshould expect R symmetries to reappear in the orbifold limit b\u03b111 \u2192 \u2212\u221e.\n\nZ\n\n5\n\nConclusion\n\nSupersymmetry is an important ingredient in many extensions of the Standard Model. However, the MSSM in its simple form has a number of problematic operators, such as dimensionfour and five operators violating baryon and lepton number conservation. Additionally, the\n\u03bc term should be of the order of the weak or TeV scale, rather than GUT or Planck scale.\nMany approaches to physics beyond the Standard Model address these problems by invoking\nadditional symmetries, which forbid or suppress the unwanted terms.\nThe aim of this paper is twofold. First, we discuss anomalies involving such symmetries\nand their cancellation. We point out that the Green\u2013Schwarz mechanism does not require\nanomalies to be universal. We illustrate this point in two examples: First we discuss a bottomup approach, where the MSSM is extended via an additional U (1) or N symmetry. Then\nwe give an explicit example of the heterotic string on blowups of the T 6 / 3 orbifold. While\nthere was no anomaly on the orbifold, there are two potentially anomalous U (1)'s in blowup.\nDepending on the particular blowup, they couple only among themselves or to the non-Abelian\ngroups from the first E8 and gravity (but never to the second E8 ).\nSecondly, we analyze the appearance of (remnant) discrete symmetries. Our choice for the\nline bundles in blowup preserves a 2 \u00d7 2 subgroup. For R symmetries, the situation is more\ninvolved: From the orbifold point of view, there are several conventions in the literature as to\nwhat the actual symmetry is, which we try to clear up. For the 3 orbifold, the sublattice\nrotations generate a 18 symmetry, with charge assignment\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nZ Z\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n(bosons, fermions, \u03b8) = (2k, 2k \u2212 3, 3) ,\nHence, the \"R part\" of the symmetry is a\n\nZ6.\n19\n\nk\u2208\n\nZ.\n\n(5.1)\n\nOur argument easily generalizes to other\n\n\forbifolds, where the order of the sublattice rotations is the least common multiple of Ni2 and\n2Ni . In the end, we find that the blowup generically breaks the R symmetry down to a 2 ,\nwhich does not constitute a nontrivial R symmetry. However, phenomenologically the presence\nof such R symmetries is not necessarily required, as also non-R symmetries can forbid the\ndangerous superpotential terms once anomaly universality is not imposed. We finally discuss\na realization of the blowup in terms of a GLSM. Here we find indications that again the\nR symmetries are generically broken by the gauge bundle, but at special subloci in K\u00e4hler\nmoduli space, there appear additional symmetries which we interpret as exchange symmetries\nof divisors when the associated divisor volumes coincide. It would be interesting to see what\nremains of this effect when including Wilson lines.\n\nZ\n\nThere are several issues which we defer to further work. On the phenomenological side, we\nshould extend our analysis to more realistic models which could lead to the MSSM via (local)\nGUTs. From the theoretical point of view, we require a better understanding of the way the\nbundle breaks the R symmetries in the GLSM, which is linked to the determination of the\ncharged massless spectrum.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Michael Blaszczyk, Stefan Groot Nibbelink, Hans Jockers, Damian Kaloni Mayorga\nPena and Hans Peter Nilles for useful discussions.
