The graph \u039b(F ) = (V, E) where E = {(i, j) | Si \u2229 Sj 6= \u2205} is called\nthe intersection graph of F . When F is a collection of intervals on the real line,\n\u039b(F ) is called an interval graph.\nA k-dimensional box or k-box in short is the Cartesian product R1 \u00d7R2 \u00d7* * *\u00d7\nRk where each Ri is a closed interval on the real line. Two k-boxes, (P1 , . . . , Pk )\nand (Q1 , . . . , Qk ) are said to have a non-empty intersection if Pi \u2229 Qi 6= \u2205, for\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 k. The boxicity of a graph G, denoted as box(G), is defined to be\nthe minimum integer k such that G is the intersection graph of a collection of\nk-boxes. Since 1-boxes are nothing but closed intervals on the real line, interval\ngraphs are the graphs with boxicity at most 1. We take the boxicity of a complete\ngraph to be 1.\nFor a graph G = (V, E), we write G = T \u222a C if E = E(T ) \u222a E(C) where\nT is a tree on the vertex set V and C is a simple cycle on the leaves of T . G\nis called a Halin graph if G has a planar embedding and T has no vertices of\ndegree 2. The notion of Halin graphs were first used by Halin [7] in his study\n\u22c6\n\nThe work done by the first and second authors was partially supported by a DST\ngrant SR/S3/EECE/62/2006.\n\n\fof minimally 3-connected graphs. Bondy and Lovasz proved that these graphs\nare almost pancyclic \u2013 they contain a cycle of each length between 3 and n\nwith the possible exception of one length, which must be even. Bondy has also\nshown that every Halin graph is 1-hamiltonian. Lovasz and Plummer [9] show\nthat every Halin graph with an even number of vertices is minimal bicritical (a\ngraph is bicritical if the removal of any two vertices from the graph will result\nin a graph with a perfect matching). Halin graphs are also interesting because\nsome problems that are NP-complete for general graphs have been shown to be\npolynomial-time solvable for Halin graphs. Examples are the travelling salesman\nproblem [5] and the problem of finding a dominating cycle with at most l vertices\n[12].\nIt has been shown in [14] that every Halin graph is a 2-interval graph \u2013 i.e.,\nthe intersection graph of sets, each of which is the union of at most 2 intervals.\nWe show in this paper that the boxicity of a Halin graph (not isomorphic to K4 )\nis equal to 2 which means that every Halin graph is the intersection graph of\naxis-parallel rectangles on the plane as well. In fact, we show a stronger result\n\u2013 we show that our result holds for any graph G = T \u222a C that has a planar\nembedding, even if there are vertices of degree 2 in T . Since box(G) = 1 when\nG is isomorphic to K4 , we show our result for graphs not isomorphic to K4 .\nThe concept of boxicity, introduced by F. S. Roberts [10], finds applications in\nfields such as ecology and operations research. Computing the boxicity of a graph\nwas shown to be NP-hard by Cozzens [6]. This was improved by Yannakakis [15]\nand later by Kratochvil [8] who showed that deciding whether the boxicity of\na graph is at most 2 itself is NP-complete. An upper bound on the boxicity of\ngeneral graphs is given in [3] where it is shown that box(G) \u2264 2\u22062 where G is any\ngraph and \u2206 is the maximum degree of a vertex in G. Also, for any graph G on n\nvertices and maximum degree \u2206, box(G) \u2264 \u2308(\u2206 + 2) ln n\u2309 [2]. It was shown in [4]\nthat box(G) \u2264 tw(G) + 2 where tw(G) is the treewidth of G. Upper bounds on\nthe boxicity of some special classes of graphs such as chordal graphs, circulararc graphs, AT-free graphs, permutation graphs and co-comparability graphs\nare also given in [4]. The boxicity of planar graphs was shown to be at most 3\nby Thomassen [13]. A better bound holds for outerplanar graphs, a subclass of\nplanar graphs. Scheinerman [11] showed that the boxicity of outerplanar graphs\nis at most 2. But this bound does not hold for the class of series-parallel graphs,\na slightly bigger subclass of planar graphs than the outerplanar graphs. Bohra\net al. [1], showed that there exists series-parallel graphs with boxicity 3. In this\npaper, we consider another subclass of planar graphs, namely the class of Halin\ngraphs. We show that the boxicity of Halin graphs is at most 2.\n\n2\n\nDefinitions and Notations\n\nAs mentioned before, the notation G = T \u222a C is used to denote a graph that\nis formed by connecting the leaves of a tree T so that the subgraph induced\nby the leaves of T in G is the simple cycle C. G is called a Halin graph if G\nis planar and T has no vertex of degree 2. For a graph G, V (G) and E(G)\n2\n\n\fdenote the vertex set and edge set of G respectively. For a vertex u \u2208 V (G),\nNG (u) = {v \u2208 V (G) | (u, v) \u2208 E(G)}. This is often abbreviated to just N (u)\nwhen the graph under consideration is clear. Given H \u2286 V (G), we denote by\nGH the subgraph induced by the vertices of H in G.\nA graph G1 is said to be the \"supergraph\" of a graph G2 if V (G1 ) = V (G2 )\nand E(G1 ) \u2287 E(G2 ). Also, given two graphs G1 and G2 on the same vertex set V\nwe define G1 \u2229G2 to be the graph with vertex set V and edge set E(G1 )\u2229E(G2 ).\nAs shown in [10], for any graph G, box(G) \u2264 k if and only if there exists k interval\ngraphs I0 , . . . , Ik such that G = I0 \u2229 * * * \u2229 Ik . Note that for this, each Ii has to\nbe a supergraph of G.\n\n3\n\nOur result\n\nWe have our main result as the following theorem.\nTheorem 1. If G = T \u222a C, where T is a tree and C is a simple cycle of the\nleaves of T such that G is planar, then box(G) = 2 if G is not isomorphic to\nK4 .\nCorollary 1. Every Halin graph has boxicity equal to 2 unless it is isomorphic\nto K4 , in which case it has boxicity equal to 1.\n\n4\n\nThe proof\n\nLet G = T \u222a C where C is a simple cycle connecting the leaves of a tree T such\nthat G is planar. Our strategy will be to construct two interval graphs G1 and\nG2 such that G = G1 \u2229 G2 thus proving that boxicity of G is at most 2. We\nwill assume that G is not a wheel since it can be seen that a wheel being just a\nuniversal vertex added to a cycle, has boxicity 2 unless it is a K4 (in which case\nthe boxicity is just 1).\n4.1\n\nFinding u\u2032\n\nLet S = V (G) \u2212 V (C) denote the set of internal vertices of the tree T . We claim\nthat there is a vertex u\u2032 \u2208 S such that |N (u\u2032 ) \u2229 S| = 1 and |N (u\u2032 ) \u2229 V (C)| \u2265 1.\nIf there is no such vertex, then GS , the induced subgraph of G on S, has no\nvertices of degree 1 which is not possible since GS is a tree (GS has more than\none vertex since G is not a wheel). Now, u\u2032 has at least one leaf as its neighbour\nsince if it did not, then its degree in T is 1 implying that u\u2032 is a leaf of T \u2013 a\ncontradiction.\n4.2\n\nFixing the root of T\n\nDesignate the internal vertex of T adjacent to u\u2032 , say r, to be the root of T .\nGiven two vertices u and v, u is said to be an ancestor of v if u lies in the path\n3\n\n\frT v and u is said to be a descendant of v if v is an ancestor of u. Note that\nevery vertex is an ancestor and a descendant of itself. Let D(u) for any vertex\nu \u2208 V (G) be defined as the set of all leaves of T that are descendants of u. It\ncan be easily seen that if u is a descendant of v, then D(u) \u2286 D(v).\n4.3\n\nOrdering the vertices of C\n\nLet |V (C)| = k and let C be p0 p1 . . . pk\u22121 p0 . Note that D(u\u2032 ) cannot contain\nall the leaves since that would mean that D(u\u2032 ) = D(r), implying that u\u2032 is the\nonly neighbour of r in T . Then the degree of r in T would be 1, a contradiction\nsince r is an internal vertex in T and not a leaf. Therefore, we can always find a\nleaf pi \u2208 D(u\u2032 ) such that p(i\u22121)modk 6\u2208 D(u\u2032 ) (recall that u\u2032 has at least one leaf\nas its neighbour and therefore, D(u\u2032 ) is not empty). We define lj = p(i+j)modk ,\nfor 0 \u2264 j \u2264 k \u2212 1. This implies that lk\u22121 6\u2208 D(u\u2032 ) since lk\u22121 = p(i\u22121)modk . For\nu \u2208 V (C), we define c(u) = i when u = li .\nFor the convenience of the reader, we summarize the construction as of now:\n\u2013 We chose a vertex u\u2032 such that its neighbourhood contains exactly one internal vertex and at least one leaf of T .\n\u2013 We chose the only internal vertex in the neighbourhood of u\u2032 to be the root\nr of T and defined the natural tree-order on T with r as the root. We also\ndefined D(u) to be the set of all leaves that are descendants (in our treeorder) of the vertex u.\n\u2013 We defined a linear ordering l0 , . . . , lk\u22121 of the vertices in V (C) (the leaves\nof T ) where l0 \u2208 D(u\u2032 ) and lk\u22121 6\u2208 D(u\u2032 ).\nClaim 1. For any vertex u \u2208 V (G), the vertices in D(u) will occur in consecutive\nplaces in the ordering l0 , . . . , lk\u22121 of the vertices in C. In other words, if u \u2208 V (G)\nand x, y, z \u2208 V (C) such that c(x) < c(z) < c(y) then it is not possible that\nx, y \u2208 D(u) and z 6\u2208 D(u).\nThough the statement of the claim looks intuitive, its proof involves some\ntechnical details. Therefore, the reader might choose to skip the proof and continue with the rest of the construction so as not to get distracted from the main\ntheme.\nProof (Claim 1). If u is a leaf of T , then the claim is trivially true. Let us assume\nthat this is not the case.\nConsider any planar embedding of G. The cycle C divides the plane into a\nbounded region and an unbounded region. We claim that all the internal vertices\nof T will lie in one of these regions. Suppose there are two internal vertices of T\nsuch that they lie in different regions of C. Then, the path between them in T\nwill have to pass the boundary of C. But the path cannot pass through a leaf of\nT and because the drawing is planar, no edge of the path can cross the boundary\nof C. We thus have a contradiction. Therefore, C forms the boundary of a face\nin any planar drawing of G.\n4\n\n\fNow, consider a planar embedding of G such that C forms the boundary of\nthe unbounded face (i.e., all the internal vertices of T lie in the bounded region\nof C). Suppose x, y \u2208 D(u) and z 6\u2208 D(u) such that c(x) < c(z) < c(y) (recall\nthat c(li ) = i). Let B = xCyT uT x. It can be easily verified that B has exactly\ntwo regions \u2013 one bounded and the other unbounded. We say that a vertex is\n\"inside\" B if it lies in the bounded region bounded by B and say that it is\n\"outside\" B if it lies in the unbounded region whose boundary is B. We say that\na vertex \"lies on\" B if it is in B.\nObservation 1. Because of the planar embedding of G that we have chosen, it\ncan be seen that any leaf vertex will have to either lie on xCy or outside B.\nObservation 2. r does not lie on B.\nWe can assume that r 6= u since that would contradict our assumption that\nz 6\u2208 D(u). Also, r cannot lie on yT u or uT x since it contradicts our assumption\nthat x and y are descendants of u and it cannot lie on xCy since it is not a leaf.\nTherefore, r does not lie on B.\nObservation 3. u\u2032 is not inside B.\nIf u\u2032 is inside B, then l0 cannot be outside B since u\u2032 is adjacent to l0 . From\nObservation 1, l0 is in xCy which implies that x = l0 and u\u2032 , being the only\ninternal vertex in N (l0 ), should lie on uT x. This contradicts our assumption\nthat u\u2032 is inside B.\nObservation 4. r is outside B.\nNow suppose r is inside B. Then, u\u2032 cannot be outside B since since r is\nadjacent to u\u2032 and it cannot be inside B due to Observation 3. Therefore, u\u2032\nlies on B. If u 6= u\u2032 , then the fact r is the only internal vertex adjacent to u\u2032\nimplies that r will have to lie on B, which contradicts Observation 2. Therefore,\nu = u\u2032 . Now, it can be seen that because of our choice of u\u2032 and r, D(u\u2032 ) =\nN (u\u2032 )\u2212{r}. This means that uT x and uT y are the edges u\u2032 x and u\u2032 y respectively\nand therefore, any path from r (inside B) to a vertex outside B will have to go\nthrough u\u2032 . Now, consider the leaf lk\u22121 . By our construction, lk\u22121 6\u2208 D(u\u2032 ).\nTherefore, y 6= lk\u22121 and lk\u22121 does not lie on xCy and hence lies outside B\n(from Observation 1). The path from r to lk\u22121 will have to go through u\u2032 as we\nhave noted before \u2013 but this implies that lk\u22121 \u2208 D(u\u2032 ) which is a contradiction.\nTherefore, r is outside B since we know from Observation 2 that r does not lie\non B.\nBecause of Observation 4, the path zT r must contain a vertex v in B because of our planarity assumption. But if v 6= u, then x and y cannot both be\ndescendants of u since either rT x or rT y will not contain u. If v = u, then rT z\ncontains u and therefore, z \u2208 D(u), again a contradiction.\nThis proves our claim that for any vertex u \u2208 V (G), the vertices in D(u)\nhave to occur consecutively in the ordering l0 , l1 , . . . , lk\u22121 .\n\u2293\n\u2294\n5\n\n\f4.4\n\nConstruction of the interval graphs G1 and G2\n\nWe define f1 and f2 to be mappings of the vertex set V (G) to closed intervals\non the real line. Let G1 and G2 denote the interval graphs defined by f1 and f2\nrespectively.\nFor a vertex u \u2208 V (G), let d(u) denote the number of ancestors of u other\nthan itself (or \"depth\" of u in T ). Let h denote the maximum depth of a vertex\nin T . Recall that k = |V (C)| and S denotes the set of internal vertices of T .\nDefinition of f1 :\nFor u \u2208 V (G),\nf1 (l0 ) = [0, k].\nf1 (u) = [c(u) \u2212 1/2, c(u) + 1/2], if u \u2208 V (C) and u 6= l0 .\nf1 (u) = [minv\u2208D(u) {c(v)}, maxv\u2208D(u) {c(v)}], if u \u2208 S.\nDefinition of f2 :\nFor u \u2208 V (G),\nf2 (u\u2032 ) = [d(u\u2032 ), h + 2].\nf2 (u) = [d(u), d(u) + 1], if u \u2208 S and u 6= u\u2032 .\nf2 (l0 ) = [h + 2, h + 2].\nf2 (l1 ) = [d(l1 ), h + 2].\nf2 (lk\u22121 ) = [d(lk\u22121 ), h + 2].\nf2 (u) = [d(u), h + 1], if u \u2208 V (C) and u is not l0 , l1 or lk\u22121 .\nClaim 2. G1 is a super graph of G.\nProof. Consider an edge (u, v) \u2208 E(G). Clearly, (u, v) \u2208 E(T ) or (u, v) \u2208 E(C).\n1. (u, v) \u2208 E(T ).\nIn this case, either u is an ancestor of v or vice versa as T is a tree. Let\nus assume without loss of generality that u is the ancestor of v. Therefore,\nD(v) \u2286 D(u). There are two possibilities now:\n(a) u and v are both internal vertices of T .\nSince D(v) \u2286 D(u), we have minx\u2208D(u) {c(x)} \u2264 minx\u2208D(v) {c(x)} \u2264\nmaxx\u2208D(v) {c(x)} \u2264 maxx\u2208D(u) {c(x)}. Therefore, f1 (u) \u2229 f1 (v) 6= \u2205,\nwhich implies that (u, v) \u2208 E(G1 ).\n(b) u is an internal vertex of T and v is a leaf vertex of T .\nSince v \u2208 D(u), minx\u2208D(u) {c(x)} \u2264 c(v) \u2264 maxx\u2208D(u) {c(x)}. Thus,\nboth f1 (u) and f1 (v) contain the point c(v) and therefore, (u, v) \u2208 E(G1 )\n(Note that c(l0 ) = 0 and thus c(l0 ) \u2208 f1 (l0 )).\n2. (u, v) \u2208 E(C).\nWithout loss of generality, we can assume that u = li , for some i, and\nv = l(i+1)modk . For 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k \u2212 2, f1 (u) and f1 (v) contain the point i + 1/2.\nIf u = l0 or v = l0 , then it is clear that (u, v) \u2208 E(G1 ), since f1 (l0 ) contains\nf1 (u),\u2200u \u2208 V (G).\nTherefore, G1 is a supergraph of G.\n6\n\n\u2293\n\u2294\n\n\fClaim 3. G2 is a supergraph of G.\nProof. Consider an edge (u, v) \u2208 E(G). We have the following three cases now.\n1. u or v is l0 .\nBy our choice of l0 , it is adjacent only to l1 , lk\u22121 and u\u2032 . Since f2 (l0 ),\nf2 (l1 ), f2 (lk\u22121 ) and f2 (u\u2032 ) contain the point h + 2, all the edges incident on\nl0 in G are also present in G2 .\n2. (u, v) \u2208 E(T ), u 6= l0 and v 6= l0 .\nLet us assume without loss of generality that u is the parent of v. It is\neasily seen that d(v) = d(u) + 1. Since u 6= l0 and v 6= l0 , the point d(u) + 1\nis contained in both f2 (u) and f2 (v) (Recall that d(u) \u2264 h, \u2200u \u2208 V (G)).\n3. (u, v) \u2208 E(C), u 6= l0 and v 6= l0 .\nSince u and v are leaf vertices, f2 (u) and f2 (v) both contain the point\nh + 1 and therefore (u, v) \u2208 E(G2 ).\nThis shows that G2 is a supergraph of G.\n\n\u2293\n\u2294\n\nClaim 4. G = G1 \u2229 G2 .\nProof. Since Claims 2 and 3 have established that G1 and G2 are supergraphs\nof G, it is sufficient to show that for any pair of vertices (u, v) 6\u2208 E(G), (u, v) 6\u2208\nE(G1 ) or (u, v) 6\u2208 E(G2 ). Consider such a pair of vertices. There are three cases\nto be considered.\n1. One of u or v is l0 .\nLet us assume without loss of generality that u = l0 . (u, v) 6\u2208 E(G) now\nimplies that v \u2208 V (G) \u2212 {l1 , lk\u22121 , u\u2032 } since l0 is only adjacent to l1 , lk\u22121 and\nu\u2032 in G. It can be easily verified that only f2 (u\u2032 ), f2 (l1 ) and f2 (lk\u22121 ) have a\nnon-empty intersection with f2 (l0 ). Therefore, (u, v) 6\u2208 E(G2 ).\n2. u 6= l0 , v 6= l0 and one of u and v is the ancestor of the other.\nLet us assume without loss of generality that u is the ancestor of v. This\nimplies that d(v) \u2265 d(u) + 2 since (u, v) 6\u2208 E(G). We know that u 6= u\u2032\nsince all the descendants of u\u2032 are its neighbours by our choice of u\u2032 and\nthe root r. Now, since u 6= u\u2032 , the right end-point of f2 (u) is d(u) + 1 and\nfor all possible choices of v (excluding l0 ), the left end-point of f2 (v) is\nd(v) \u2265 d(u) + 2. Therefore, f2 (u) \u2229 f2 (v) = \u2205 by the definition of f2 . Thus,\nin this case, (u, v) 6\u2208 E(G2 ).\n3. u 6= l0 , v 6= l0 and neither one of u and v is an ancestor of the other.\nOne of the following three subcases hold.\n(a) u and v are both leaves of T .\nLet u = li and v = lj . Assume without loss of generality that i < j.\nSince neither of u or v is l0 , we have 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 k \u2212 1. Also, j > i + 1\nas (u, v) 6\u2208 E(G). Therefore, f1 (li ) \u2229 f1 (lj ) = \u2205, from the definition of f1 .\nThus, we have (u, v) 6\u2208 E(G1 ).\n(b) u and v are both internal vertices of T .\nSince u 6\u2208 rT v and v 6\u2208 rT u, we have D(u) \u2229 D(v) = \u2205 (To see this,\nsuppose there is a vertex z \u2208 D(u) \u2229 D(v). Then both u and v would\n7\n\n\flie on rT z, implying that either u \u2208 rT v or v \u2208 rT u). Now, from Claim\n1, we have maxx\u2208D(u) {c(x)} < minx\u2208D(v) {c(x)} or maxx\u2208D(v) {c(x)} <\nminx\u2208D(u) {c(x)}. By the definition of f1 , it can be seen that f1 (u) \u2229\nf1 (v) = \u2205, implying that (u, v) 6\u2208 E(G1 ).\n(c) One of u and v is a leaf of T and the other is an internal vertex of T .\nLet us assume that u is an internal vertex and v is a leaf of T . Since\nwe are considering the case when neither of u and v is an ancestor of the\nother and neither is l0 , we have v 6\u2208 D(u) and v 6= l0 . From Claim 1, we\nknow that either c(v) < minx\u2208D(u) {c(x)} or c(v) > maxx\u2208D(u) {c(x)}.\nTherefore, by definition of f1 and because v 6= l0 , f1 (u) \u2229 f1 (v) = \u2205 and\nthus we have (u, v) 6\u2208 E(G1 ).\nSince we have considered all possible cases when (u, v) 6\u2208 E(G) and have\nshown that in each case, (u, v) is not present either in E(G1 ) or in E(G2 ), it\nfollows that G = G1 \u2229 G2 .\n\u2293\n\u2294\nNow, to complete the proof, we show that if G is not isomorphic to K4 ,\nthen box(G) \u2265 2. Suppose G is not isomorphic to K4 . We will show that G\nis not an interval graph. By definition of G, |V (C)| \u2265 3. If |V (C)| > 3, then\nC is an induced cycle with more than 3 vertices which means that G cannot\nbe an interval graph and therefore box(G) \u2265 2. If |V (C)| = 3, then C is a\ntriangle. Now, all the leaves in V (C) cannot be adjacent to the same internal\nvertex of T . To see this, look at GS , the subgraph induced by S in G (recall that\nS = V (G) \u2212 V (C), or the set of internal vertices of T ). Since G is not isomorphic\nto K4 , GS is a tree with more than one vertex. Therefore, there are at least two\nvertices of degree 1 if GS . But since all the vertices in V (C) are adjacent only to\none vertex of S in G, there should be at least one vertex in S with degree 1 in\nG \u2013 which is a contradiction since all vertices of S, being internal vertices of T ,\nhave degree more than 1 in G. Therefore, we can find two leaves, say x and y,\nof T such that they are adjacent to different internal vertices in T . Let u and v\ndenote the internal vertices of T adjacent to x and y respectively. Now, xuT vyx\nforms an induced cycle of length greater than or equal to 4. Therefore, G cannot\nbe an interval graph. Thus, we have box(G) \u2265 2.\n\nReferences\n1. Ankur Bohra, L. Sunil Chandran, and J. Krishnam Raju. Boxicity of series-parallel\ngraphs. Discrete Mathematics, 306(18):2219\u20132221, 2006.\n2. L.
