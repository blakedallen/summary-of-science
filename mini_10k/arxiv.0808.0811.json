The excitement that\nit initially created gave rise to many interesting and useful early\npapers, some of which are collected in [24]. Supersymmetry\n\u2217 jadix@telus.net\n\u2020 Fax:\n\n(403) 266-1487\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nis still appealing to many physicists, as is evident from the\nproceedings of the recent conferences on SUSY [2] [3] [4].\nWith the advent of the LHC, we may soon have some experimental evidence for supersymmetric partners to the known\nparticles. But how can we recognize any new particles as supersymmetric partners of known particles? There is a gap between conserved supersymmetry and the real world. This is\nthe theoretical problem of supersymmetry breaking, and many\nphysicists feel that it has not yet been resolved in a satisfactory\nway.\nThis paper describes a new approach to supersymmetry breaking. It appears that this approach resolves the problem of\ncomparing theory with experiment, without introducing other\nproblems. A first sketch of the phenomenology can be seen below in section 11. That section deals with the electrons, muons\nand tau leptons, and their superpartners, for the special case\nwhere all the mixing matrices are diagonal. The more general case is worked out in [19]. The neutrinos behave in the\nsame way, but with different matrices, reflecting their smaller\nmasses.\nThe new approach is based on some remarkable features of\nthe BRS cohomology of supersymmetry applied to composite\noperators. It will be seen that supersymmetry is broken by\nthose operators. The breaking happens when the vacuum expectation value (VEV) is turned on. So supersymmetry and\ngauge symmetry break together. The breaking is closely related\nto supersymmetry anomalies that resemble the the well-known\ngauge anomalies, but there are also big differences from those\nanomalies.\nEssentially, what happens is that certain important composite operators develop a new realization of supersymmetry. This\nnew realization is very specific to the standard supersymmetric\n2\n\n\f3\n\nmodel (SSM). The new realization incorporates effective supersymmetry anomalies proportional to the VEV. We call this\nnew anomalous algebra the 'cybersusy algebra'. Experimental predictions from this new algebra can be made using the\ntechnique of effective actions. A quick sketch of the historical\ndevelopment of this subject is attempted in section 12 below,\nand the origin of the name 'cybersusy' is discussed in section\n13.2. The calculations that stand behind the results of this introductory paper can be found in three papers that follow this\nintroductory paper. They are [17] [18] [19].\n2\n\nNotation for the Supersymmetric Standard Model\n\nHere is the superspace potential for the Supersymmetric Standard Model (SSM):\nPSP = g\u01ebij H i K j J \u2212 gJm2 J + ppq \u01ebij LpiH j P q\n\n+rpq \u01ebij LpiK j Rq + tpq \u01ebij QcpiK j Tcq + bpq \u01ebij QcpiH j Bcq\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nThe massless SSM arises when we set gJ m2 = 0 in the Superpotential (2) above. We are forced to introduce neutrino\nmasses through the right handed neutrino superfield Rp to implement the present supersymmetry breaking mechanism for\nneutrinos.\nAll of the above fields in PSP are the scalar parts of chiral\nsuperfields. When the scalars are replaced by their superfields\nand PSP is put into the SSM action, the gJ term gives rise\nto the VEV which spontaneously breaks the gauge symmetry\nSU (3) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) down to SU (2) \u00d7 U (1):\ngv 2 = gJ\n\n(3)\n\n< H 1 >=< K1 >= mv\n\n(4)\n\n3\n\n\f4\ncq\nWe use E\nto denote a superfield whose \u03b8, \u03b8 independent part\nis the scalar E q . For example Liq is the scalar part of the left\nleptonic SU(2) doublet chiral scalar superfield L\u0302iq . The spinor\niq\nand the auxiliary is FLiq . The comcomponent is labelled \u03c8L\u03b1\nb\nb\nplex conjugate is Liq . The scalar component of Liq is labelled\nb\nLiq , the spinor component of Liq is labelled \u03c8 Liq\u03b1\u0307 and the auxiliary is F Liq . A chiral scalar superfield Lb iq satisfies the chiral\nconstraint D\u03b1\u0307 Lb iq = 0, and its complex conjugate satisfies the\nb\nantichiral constraint D\u03b1 Liq = 0. Our notation is based on that\nin [6], though there are differences. A summary of our notation\nis in the appendix to [17].\nAfter spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry, the two SU (2)\ndoublets will give rise to the following superfields:\n\uf8eb\n\nQcpi \u2192 \uf8ed\n\nU cp\nDcp\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8 ; Lpi\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\u2192\uf8ed\n\nNp\nEp\n\nHere is an aid to remembering the notation:\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\n(5)\n\nccpi\n1. Q\nis the Quark doublet superfield, and\n2. Lb pi is the Lepton doublet superfield, and\nccp\n3. U\nand Tccp are the left and right 'Up-Top' squark superfields, and\nccp\ncp\n4. D\nand B\nc are the left and right 'Down-Bottom' squark\nsuperfields.\ncp\ncp\n5. N\nand R\nare the left and right 'Neutrino-Right' leptonic\nsuperfields, and\ncp\ncp\n6. E\nand P\nare the left and right 'Electron-Positron' leptonic\nsuperfields,\nci b\nci\n7. H\n, J and K\nare the Higgs-type superfields,\n8. The complex matrices ppq , rpq , tpq , bpq are matched to, and\ncq\nnamed after, the right handed SU(2) singlet superfields P\n,\ncq ccq ccq\nR , T , B , to form interaction terms, which also become\n\n4\n\n\f5\n\nmass terms when the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken.\n9. Note that the second index of ppq is contracted with the\ncq\nright superfield P\n, etc.\nHere is a table summarizing the various quantum numbers:\nTable of the Chiral Superfields in the SSM\nSuperstandard Model, Left L Fields\nField Y SU(3) SU(2) F B L D\nLpi\n-1\n1\n2\n3 0 1\n1\n1\nQcpi\n3\n2\n3 13 0\n1\n3\nJ\n0\n1\n1\n1 0 0\n1\nSuperstandard Model, Right R Fields\nPp\n2\n1\n1\n3 0 -1 1\np\nR\n0\n1\n1\n3 0 -1 1\n4\nTcp \u2212 3\n3\n1\n3 \u2212 31 0\n1\n1\n2\np\nBc\n3\n1\n3 \u22123 0\n1\n3\nHi\n-1\n1\n2\n1 0 0\n1\ni\nK\n1\n1\n2\n1 0 0\n1\n\n(6)\n\nIn the above, Y is weak hypercharge, F stands for the number\nof families for each superfield, B is baryon number, L is lepton\nnumber and D stands for mass dimension.\n3\n\nSome Special Composite Operators in the SSM\n\nConsider the following composite operators1 in the supersymmetric standard model (SSM):\n\u03c9P q\u03b1\u0307 = g\u03c8 Liq\u03b1\u0307 K i + pqp\u03c8 J \u03b1\u0307 P p + * * *\n\n\u03c9Ep\u03b1\u0307 = g\u03c8 P p\u03b1\u0307 K iHi \u2212 pqp \u03c8 J \u03b1\u0307 Liq Hi + * * *\nThese composite operators are very special, because:\n1 In\n\n(7)\n(8)\n\nthese expressions q is a flavour index, i on K i is an SU(2) isospin index and \u03b1\u0307 is a Weyl dotted spinor index.\n\n5\n\n\f6\n\n1. When the scalar fields H i and K i get their vacuum expectation values (VEVs), the leading terms in the above\noperators are the elementary spinor fields for the antielectron (\u03c8 Eq\u03b1\u0307 ) and the antipositron (\u03c8 P q\u03b1\u0307 ) times coupling constants times powers of the mass parameter m. Hence these\noperators clearly are physical, at least after gauge symmetry gets broken.\n2. The BRS cohomology of the massless SSM [18] tells us how\nto fill in the dots + * * * in the operators (7) and (8) so as\nto make these into some very special composite operators\nthat behave under supersymmetry like chiral dotted spinor\nsuperfields \u03c9b Ep\u03b1\u0307 and \u03c9b P q\u03b1\u0307 . A chiral dotted spinor superfield\n\u03c9b Eq\u03b2\u0307 satisfies the chiral constraint D\u03b1\u0307 \u03c9b Eq\u03b2\u0307 = 0. The terms\n(7) and (8) are just the \u03b8, \u03b8 independent parts of those chiral\ndotted spinor superfields, in accord with our usual notation\nin section 2.\n3. When the VEVs appear in the SSM, the chiral dotted composite superfields that result from (7) and (8) cease to behave like superfields. Under the action of the BRS operator\n\u03b4 for supersymmetry, they have the usual supersymmetry\nvariations plus the following:\ncq\nC \u03b1\u0307\n\u03b4 \u03c9b P p\u03b1\u0307 = gm2 v 2 ppq P\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\ncq\n+ * * * C \u03b1\u0307\n\u03b4 \u03c9b Ep\u03b1\u0307 = gm2 v 2 pqp mv E\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\ncq\nwhere E\nis the\nchiral scalar superfield for the electron, and\n\u0011\ncq\ncq\nmv E + * * * is a composite superfield, and P\nis the chiral\nscalar superfield for the positron\ncq\n4. Note that in the spontaneously broken theory, \u03c9b P p\u03b1\u0307 and P\ncq\nboth have the charge of the positron, and \u03c9b Ep\u03b1\u0307 and E\nboth\nhave the charge of the electron.\n5. Perhaps it is best to think of the multiplet \u03c9b P p\u03b1\u0307 as a supersymmetric set of bound states of the antielectron multiplet\n\u0010\n\n6\n\n\f7\n\nwith the scalars K i, following equation (7), with a similar\nnotion for \u03c9b Ep\u03b1\u0307 , but this is not at all clear, nor is it necessary to decide this issue for present purposes. Anyway these\n'bound states' get mixed up with the elementary fields.\n6. However, as will be seen later, this concept of supersymmetric bound states, driving supersymmetry breaking, becomes\nmuch more plausible and compelling for baryons. Indeed,\nit becomes irresistible for baryons. But it is not yet known\nwhether cybersusy makes sense for baryons, because the\nnecessary calculations are long and have not yet been done.\n4 An attempt to formulate a more general BRS version of the philosophy of effective fields and effective\nactions\nThere is a new and important realization of the supersymmetry\nalgebra embodied in the transformations (9) and (10). In order\nto explore that realization we use the technique of effective\nactions.\nLet us repeat here the following useful remarks from the second volume of Weinberg's treatise on quantum field theory [22],\nwhich summarizes the philosophy of using effective actions in\na way that seems relevant to what we are going to do:\nSome years after ... there emerged a different justification\nfor the effective field theory technique... It is based on the realization (not yet formally embodied in a theorem) that when we\ncalculate a physical amplitude from Feynman diagrams using\nthe most general Lagrangian that involves the relevant degrees\nof freedom and satisfies the assumed symmetries of the theory,\nwe are simply constructing the most general amplitude that is\nconsistent with general principles of relativity, quantum mechanics and the assumed symmetries.\n7\n\n\f8\n\nHere we are going to start with the philosophical remark\nabove and then take the following steps, inspired by the above\nremarks, but adapted to what happens with the current situation:\n1. Define elementary 'effective' fields, with canonical dimensions, which correspond to the composite fields.\n2. The canonical dimensions of the effective fields are to be\ndetermined so that the kinetic part of the action, which\nis to be constructed in item 5 below, contains those fields\nnormalized so that the pure kinetic part does not contain\nfactors of mass.\n3. Write down a BRS operator \u03b4 for the elementary 'effective'\nfields which has the same symmetry transformations and\nthe same algebra as the composite fields.\n4. Check that the BRS algebra closes:\n\u03b4 2 = 0.\n\n(11)\n\n5. Write down the most general local Lagrangian field theory\nwhich contains those effective fields and which is invariant\nunder that \u03b4, and also examine related field theories, made\nof the same fields, that are invariant under related nilpotent\noperators \u03b4.\n6. Use those local Lagrangian field theories to derive information about the symmetry characterized by \u03b4, its properties,\nand, when appropriate, the breaking of that symmetry.\n5\n\nCybersusy Algebra for the Electrons\n\nWe will call the present approach cybersusy, for reasons explained in section 13.2. Let us try to carry out these steps in\nthe above order, and see what happens:\n8\n\n\f9\n\n1. First we assign new elementary effective chiral superfields to\nthe old composite superfields, as follows. We could use the\nsame names for the first fields (12) and (13), but that would\nconfuse composite with elementary fields, so we will use\nnew names. We will use the subscripts L(eft) and R(ight)\nto denote the effective superfields2 :\n\u03c9b Ep\u03b1\u0307 \u21d2 \u03c9b Lp\u03b1\u0307\n\n(12)\n\n\u03c9b P p\u03b1\u0307 \u21d2 \u03c9b Rp\u03b1\u0307\n\n(13)\n\ncq\ncp\n+ *** \u21d2 A\ngm2 v 2 mv P\nR\n\n(15)\n\ncp cp\nA\nL , AR have Dimension = 1\n\n(17)\n\ncp\n\u21d2\ngm2 v 2 E\n\u0010\n\ncp\nA\nL\n\u0011\n\n(14)\n\n2. The masses in (14) and (15) have been absorbed. All the\nfields get new dimensions, to be consistent with the canonical dimensions for these new effective chiral superfields,\nwhich are as follows:\n1\n\u03c9b Lp\u03b1\u0307 , \u03c9b Lp\u03b1\u0307 have Dimension =\n(16)\n2\nand we note that\n\n1\n2\nhave Dimension = 1\n\nC \u03b1\u0307 , C\u03b1 have Dimension = \u2212\nm, \u2202\u03b1\u03b2\u0307\n\n(18)\n(19)\n\nThese dimensions are canonical for the action to be written\ndown below in section 6.\n3. Next we write down the abstract algebra as realized on\nthese new fields.

In [19], we will return to this algebra and write it out in\ncomponents. That is desirable, since as will be seen below,\nwe must use components to write out the action which is\ninvariant under the cybersusy algebra (see (60) below for\nexample), and components are essential when working out\nthe masses, since supersymmetry is entirely gone at that\npoint.\n6 Cybersusy Action for the pure supersymmetry operator \u03b4 = \u03b4SS when the VEV is zero\nNow we write down the general local Lagrangian field theory\nthat uses these fields and that embodies this symmetry and the\nvarious subsymmetries.

The equations\nof motion follow easily from functional derivations. One writes\ndown all the equations like\n\u03b4AScalar\n= 0 = \u2212\u2206ALp + mgrp FRr\n(45)\np\n\u03b4AL\n\u03b4AScalar\n= 0 = FRp + mg spALs\n(46)\n\u03b4F Rp\nand then one needs to perform some operations to combine the\nequations and one gets equations like\n3 Chiral\n\ndotted superfields are also discussed in [6], where a constraint is imposed to extract a vector represention.\n\n13\n\n\f14\n\nSince the matrix Gp s = grp g sr is a positive definite hermitian\nmatrix, it can be diagonalized and this yields three equations\nof the form\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2206 + m2 G AL 0\n(48)\nfor the three flavours, with G different for each flavour.\n\n7.2\n\nEquations of motion of Dotspinor Superfields\n\nNext, let us have a look at the equations of motion for the\nchiral dotspinor field from the above action. The action for the\ndotspinor superfields is:\nADotspinor = ADotspinorL + ADotspinorR + ADotspinor Mass\n\n(49)\n\nwhere these are defined in (40), (41) and (42).\nAgain here the equations of motion follow easily from functional derivations. But there are no auxiliaries to eliminate.\nAnd there is an extra factor of \u2206 in many places. For example:\n\u03b4ADotspinor\nand\n\nq\n\n\u03b4 \u03b2\u0307\n\u2212 m2 dpq W R\u03b1\u03b3\u0307\n= 0 = \u2212\u2202\u03b1\u03b2\u0307 \u2202\u03b4\u03b3\u0307 WLp\n\n(50)\n\n\u03b4ADotspinor\nq\n\u03b6 \u01eb\u0307\n= 0 = \u2212\u2202 \u03b1\u01eb\u0307\u2202 \u03b6 \u03b3\u0307 W R\u03b1\u03b3\u0307 \u2212 m2 dsq WLs\n\u03b4WR\u03b6 \u01eb\u0307q\n\n(51)\n\n\u03b1\u03b3\u0307p\n\u03b4W L\n\nOperating on equation (50) with the derivatives \u2202 \u03b1\u01eb\u0307 \u2202 \u03b6 \u03b3\u0307 yields:\nq\n\n\u03b4 \u03b2\u0307\n\u2212 m2 dpq \u2202 \u03b1\u01eb\u0307 \u2202 \u03b6 \u03b3\u0307 W R\u03b1\u03b3\u0307\n0 = \u2212\u2202 \u03b1\u01eb\u0307\u2202 \u03b6 \u03b3\u0307 \u2202\u03b1\u03b2\u0307 \u2202\u03b4\u03b3\u0307 WLp\n\n(52)\n\nThen equation (51) yields:\n\u03b6 \u01eb\u0307\n\u03b6 \u01eb\u0307\n\u2212 m4 dpq dsq WLs\n0 = \u22062 WLp\n\n(53)\n\nSince the matrix Dp s = dpq dsq is a positive definite hermitian\nmatrix, it can be diagonalized, and this yields three equations\nof the form\n\u0010\n\u0011\n2\n4\n(54)\n\u2206 \u2212 m D \u03c9 \u03b1L = 0\n14\n\n\f15\n\nfor the three flavours, with D different for each flavour.\nThese can be written\n\u0012\n\u221a \u0013\u0012\n\u221a \u0013 \u03b1\n2\n2\n\u2206 \u2212 m D \u2206 + m D \u03c9L = 0\n(55)\n\u0010\n\u221a \u0011\nOnly the term \u2206 + m2 D behaves like a normal equation\nof motion,\ngiving rise to a normal propagator.

The other term \u2206 \u2212 m2 D has no zero for any\nreal energy squared. This unusual equation of motion is at the\nheart of the supersymmetry breaking mechanism in cybersusy4 .\n8\nConstruction of Compensators to build up an action invariant under the total BRS operator \u03b4 = \u03b4SS +\n\u03b4GSB for the general case when the VEV is not zero\nNext we will write down the action for the general case where\nthe term \u03b4GSB 6= 0. The operator \u03b4GSB is defined in item 3b in\nsection 5.\nNote that the scalar action AScalar, which consists of (37),\n(38) and (39), is invariant under \u03b4GSB because \u03b4GSB does not\naffect any of the scalar superfields.\nThe terms that are not invariant under \u03b4GSB are the three\nparts of ADotspinor , which are (40), (41) and (42).\n8.1\n\nConstruction of Left Compensators AKCL1 and AKCL2\n\nWe can compensate the noninvariance of the term ADotspinorL\nin equation (40) by adding two more terms AKCL1 and AKCL2\nto the action. The subscript 'KC' stands for 'Kinetic Compensator'. These three terms then form an invariant under the\noperator \u03b4L = \u03b4SSL + \u03b4GSBL in the following way:\n4 For\n\n\u221a \u0001\nthe baryons, this pattern repeats, except that there are more factors like \u2206 \u2212 m2 D .\n\n15\n\n\f16\n\n\u03b4SSL ADotspinorL = 0\n\n(56)\n\n\u03b4GSBL ADotspinorL + \u03b4SSL AKCL1 = 0\n\n(57)\n\n\u03b4GSBL AKCL2 = 0\n\n(59)\n\n\u03b4GSBL AKCL1 + \u03b4SSL AKCL2 = 0\n\n(58)\n\nThe superspace forms of ActionKCL1 and ActionKCL2 are nonlocal in superspace, and not very nice to look at. However these\nexpressions are local when they are written in components in\nspacetime:\nAKCL1 =\n\nZ\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03b1\u0307\n\u03b1\u03b1\u0307\n+ pqp F Lq \u2202\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 WLp\nd4x pqp \u03c8 L\u03b1\u0307q \u2206\u03c9Lp\n\nq\n\u2206\u03c9p\u03b1\n+pqp\u03c8L\u03b1\nL\n\nAKCL2 =\n\nZ\n\n+\n\np\u03b1\u03b1\u0307\npqp FLq \u2202\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 W L\n\u0010\n\n\u0013\n\nd4 x pqp psp AqL \u2206ALs + FLq F Ls\n\nThe result is that the total left action\n\n(60)\n\u0011\n\nAL Total = AScalarL + ADotspinorL + AKCL1 + AKCL2\n\n(61)\n(62)\n\nis invariant under the left operator \u03b4L = \u03b4SSL + \u03b4GSBL :\n\u03b4LAL Total = 0\n\n(63)\n\nOf course, it is also invariant under the operator \u03b4R = \u03b4SSR +\n\u03b4GSBR , but that is trivial because it is a function of the left\nfields only.\nNote that the signs of the terms AqL\u2206ALs and FLq F Ls terms\nare the same in equation (61), whereas they are opposite in the\naction (37). Note that pqp psp is a positive hermitian matrix,\nwhich can be diagonalized to a positive diagonal matrix P .\nThen the total action, which is the sum of (61) and (37), will\nhave the right signs for these terms only if 0 \u2264 P < U where\nU is the unit matrix. This issue is discussed more fully in [19].\n16\n\n\f17\n\n8.2\n\nConstruction of Right Compensators AKCR1 and AKCR2\n\nAll the above discussion for the left sector is identical for the\nright sector, except for the change L \u2192 R everywhere.

Arrange that \u03b4GSB = 0, which means that gauge symmetry\nbreaking is not present. For the theory with \u03b4GSB = 0, the\nkinetic compensator terms are absent and the most general\naction contains the terms ADotspinor Mass. It also turns out\nthat in this case, the action results in a supersymmetric\nspectrum and the dotspinor is now a massive supermultiplet.\n2. Arrange that the coefficient of ADotspinor Mass is zero. For the\ntheory with ADotspinor Mass absent, the most general action\ncontains kinetic compensator terms and it is invariant under\nthe full operator \u03b4 = \u03b4SS +\u03b4GSB . It turns out that the action\nin this case also results in a supersymmetric spectrum and\nthe dotspinor gives rise to a massless supermultiplet.\nWe have been looking for an action for supersymmetry breaking, so let us examine the situation where we refuse to make\nthis choice, and just keep the action ACybersusy . We note that\nACybersusy is uniquely chosen as the action which has the properties that\n18\n\n\f19\n\n1. Supersymmetry breaking vanishes when the Vacuum Expectation Value (VEV) vanishes, and\n2. Supersymmetry breaking vanishes when the dotspinor superfield mass coefficent vanishes.\nSo we have arrived at a uniquely defined action for this symmetry, and it contains explicit supersymmetry breaking. The\nnext questions are\n1. What is the spectrum?\n2. Does the theory make sense?\n10\n\nThe polynomials that determine the masses\n\nNow let us see what the cybersusy action in section (9) yields\nfor the masses. This is calculated in detail in [19]. The answer\nis surprisingly simple, given the complexity of the mixing. The\nkinetic/mass terms for all the bosons and fermions in the above\naction can be inverted to find the propagators. Since they are\nquite mixed up, this is quite a chore. Our working hypothesis is\nthat the mass eigenstates are the mass values of the momentum\nsquared p\u03bcp\u03bc which give rise to poles in those propagators. We\ndefine the dimensionless parameter:\np\u03bc p\u03bc\n\u2206\n(74)\nX= 2\u21d2\nm\nm2\nand we combine the matrices above into the positive definite\nhermitian matrices:\nP = pp\u2020; G = gg \u2020 ; D = dd\u2020\n\n(75)\n\nThen it turns out that, for the simplest case of one flavour,\nthere are only three different kinds of poles in the Fermion\npropagator, and the relevant masses arise from the three negative real solutions of the following quintic polynomial equation\nfor the spin J = 12 fermionic leptons:\n19\n\n\f20\n\nn\n\nPQuintic Fermi (X) = X X 2 (1 \u2212 P ) \u2212 D\n\no2\n\nn\n\n+ G X2 \u2212 D\n\no2\n\n=0\n(76)\nIt also turns out that, for the simplest case of one flavour,\nthere are only four different kinds of poles for the Bose propagator, and the relevant masses arise from the three negative\nreal solutions of the following quartic polynomial equation for\nthe spin J = 0 bosonic scalar leptons:\n\u0010\n\n\u00112\n\n\u0010\n\n\u00112\n\nPQuartic Bose(X) = X 2 X(1 \u2212 P )2 + G \u2212 X(1 \u2212 P 2 ) + G D = 0\n(77)\nand the one negative real solution of the following quadratic\npolynomial equation for the spin J = 1 vector boson lepton\nPQuadratic Bose(X) = X 2 \u2212 D = 0\n\n(78)\n\nThis last equation is simply another way of writing the equation (55) for the vector boson lepton. The vector boson mass\nis not affected by the supersymmetry breaking mechanism of\ncybersusy.\nLet us examine what happens to the above polynomials (76),\n(77) and (78) when we set the VEV to zero. Taking the VEV\nto zero is equivalent to setting P = 0, and that results in:\nn\n\nP \u21920\n\nPQuintic Fermi (X) \u2212\u2192 {X + G} X 2 \u2212 D\nP \u21920\n\nn\n\no2\n\nPQuartic Bose(X) \u2212\u2192 {X + G}2 X 2 \u2212 D\nP \u21920\n\n(79)\n\no\n\n(80)\n\n\u0011\n\n(82)\n\nPQuadratic Bose(X) \u2212\u2192 X 2 \u2212 D\n(81)\nThis is just ordinary supersymmetry as in section 6 above.\nNow let us examine what happens to the above polynomials\n(76), (77) and (78) when we set the mass of the dotspinor\nmultiplet to zero. Taking the mass of the dotspinor multiplet\nto zero is equivalent to setting D = 0, and that results in:\nD\u21920\n\n\u0010\n\nPQuintic Fermi (X) \u2212\u2192 X 4 X(1 \u2212 P )2 + G\n\n20\n\n\f21\nD\u21920\n\n\u0010\n\n\u00112\n\nPQuartic Bose(X) \u2212\u2192 X 2 X(1 \u2212 P )2 + G\nD\u21920\n\n(83)\n\nPQuadratic Bose(X) \u2212\u2192 X 2\n(84)\nAs claimed, the supersymmetry is restored, and there is a zero\nmass multiplet. Note that the masses do depend on the gauge\nsymmetry breaking parameter P however.\nThese details also confirm the remarks made in the two points\nafter equation (73) above.\n11\n\nThree Numerical Examples\n\nLet us look at what this means in terms of particles. We have\na quintic equation to solve to get the fermion masses, and a\nquartic equation and a quadratic equation to solve to get the\nboson masses.\nWe solve these numerically using Mathematica for three examples, and here are the results, which we will discuss below\nin subsection 11.4.\n11.1 Choice 1 for P, G, D\u2013an example that probably is inconsistent with known experimental results\n\nFor example, one finds that the following choice for P, G, D,\nP = .99999999, G = 1, D = 1018\n\n(85)\n\nyields the following values for the zeros of the fermionic quintic\npolynomial equation PQuintic Fermi (X) = 0:\nX = \u22129.00722 \u2217 1015, \u22129.93414 \u2217 1011, \u22121,\n\n(86)\n\n5.06707 \u2217 1011 \u2212 8.65953 \u2217 1011i, 5.06707 \u2217 1011 + 8.65953 \u2217 1011i,\n(87)\nand the following values for the eigenvalues of the bosonic quartic polynomial equation PQuartic Bose(X) = 0:\nX = \u22125.26316 \u2217 107, 1.9 \u2217 1017, \u22122.1 \u2217 1017, \u22124.7619 \u2217 107 (88)\n21\n\n\f22\n\n11.2\n\nChoice 2 for P, G, D\n\nHere is another choice for P, G, D:\nP = 1 \u2212 10\u221215, G = 1, D = 1030\n\n(89)\n\nIt yields the following values for the zeros of the fermionic quintic polynomial equation:\n\u22121.0000 \u2217 1030, \u22129.9999 \u2217 1019, \u22121.0000,\n\n(90)\n\n5.0001 \u2217 1019 \u2212 8.6603 \u2217 1019i, 5.0001 \u2217 1019 + 8.6603 \u2217 1019i, (91)\nand the following values for the eigenvalues of the bosonic quartic polynomial equation:\n\u22121.0000\u22171015, 1.0000\u22171030, \u22123.0000\u22171030, \u22123.3333\u22171014 (92)\n11.3\n\nChoice 3 for P, G, D\n\nHere is another choice for P, G, D:\nP = 1 \u2212 10\u221225, G = 1, D = 1050\n\n(93)\n\nIt yields the following values for the zeros of the fermionic quintic polynomial equation:\n\u22121.0000 \u00d7 1050, \u22122.1544 \u00d7 1033, \u22121.0000,\n\n(94)\n\n1.0772\u00d71033\u22121.8658\u00d71033i, 1.0772\u00d71033+1.8658\u00d71033i, (95)\n\nand the following values for the eigenvalues of the bosonic quartic polynomial equation:\n\u22121.000 \u00d7 1025, 1.0000 \u00d7 1050, \u22123.0000 \u00d7 1050, \u22123.3333 \u00d7 1024\n(96)\n\n22\n\n\f23\n\n11.4\n\nDiscussion of the Choices for P, G, D\n\nSuppose that we are applying these choices to the electron in\nthe simplest case where there is just one flavour. Then:\n1. The model does make some sense in terms of the number\nof predicted masses, at least at first glance:\n(a) For all three choices, the fermionic quintic polynomial\nequation has three real negative solutions and two complex solutions.\n(b) For all three choices, the bosonic quartic polynomial\nequation has three real negative solutions and one real\npositive solution.\n(c) For all three choices, the bosonic quadratic polynomial\nequation has one real negative solution and one real positive solution.\n(d) The complex and positive solutions do not give rise to\nmasses, for reasons explained after equation (55). So\nthese yield three fermionic masses and four bosonic masses.\n2. The electron is the lightest particle in the broken supersymmetry multiplet:\n(a) For all three choices, the electron mass2 would be the\nterm corresponding to the fermionic solution \u22121, and\nthe corresponding mass2 would be m2 .\n(b) The electron has the lowest mass2 = m2 for all three\nchoices.\n(c) It is encouraging, at least, that the electron is the lowest\nmass particle for these three choices of the parameters\nP, G, D, and that the other particles are very much more\nmassive.\n3. For all three choices, the next lightest particle in the broken\nsupersymmetry multiplet is a scalar selectron, and its mass\nis very different for the three choices:\n23\n\n\f24\n\n(a) For Choice 1, the next lowest mass2 , after the electron,\nwould be the lowest mass bosonic lepton, which would\nhave mass2 = 4.7619 \u2217 107m2 , corresponding to mass\n= 6900.66m. So the mass of this lowest mass leptonic\nboson would be predicted to have a mass a little larger\nthan the mass of three protons, since the proton has a\nmass of about 2000 times the mass of the electron. No\ndoubt, such a particle would have been found by now if\nit existed.\n(b) For Choice 2, the next lowest mass2 , after the electron,\nwould be the lowest mass bosonic lepton, which would\nhave mass2 = 3.3333 \u2217 1014m2 , corresponding to mass\n= 1.82574 \u2217 107m. So, for Choice 2, the mass of this\nlowest mass leptonic boson would be predicted to have\na mass of about the mass of 10,000 protons, since the\nproton has a mass of about 2000 times the mass of the\nelectron.\n(c) For Choice 3, the next lowest mass2 , after the electron,\nwould be the lowest mass bosonic lepton, which would\nhave mass2 = 3.3333 \u2217 1024m2 , corresponding to mass\n= 1.82574 \u2217 1012m. So, for Choice 2, the mass of this\nlowest mass leptonic boson would be predicted to have a\nmass of about the mass of 109 protons, since the proton\nhas a mass of about 2000 times the mass of the electron.\n(d) Evidently, there is a range between these masses for the\nlightest supersymmetric partner (3 to 109 proton masses)\nthat is amenable to detection at the LHC, so, if the\nnumbers work out, one could detect supersymmetry at\nthe LHC consistent with this model for supersymmetry\nbreaking.\n4. The other particles are all heavier, but they are also quite\nconstricted by the masses of the electron and the lightest\n24\n\n\f25\n\nselectron, since there are only three parameters P, G, D and\nwe already have two masses:\n(a) The other two negative fermionic solutions would correspond to heavy leptonic fermions with mass2 = 9.00722\u2217\n1015m2 and mass2 = 9.93414 \u2217 1011m2 for Choice 1 and\nmuch heavier masses for Choice 2.\n(b) For Choice 1, the other two bosonic masses here would be\npredicted to have mass2 = 5.26316 \u2217 107m2 and mass2 =\n2.1 \u2217 1017m2 . Again these are much heavier for Choice 2.\n(c) For Choice 1, there would also\nbe the observable leptonic\n\u221a\n2\nDm2 = 109m2 so the mass\nvector boson withqmass\n= \u221a\n\u221a\nwould be mass =\nDm2 = 109m2 = 31623m\n(d) For Choice 2, there would also\nleptonic\n\u221a be 2the observable\n2\n15 2\nvector boson with q\nmass\n\u221a = 10 m so the mass\n\u221a = Dm\n2\nDm = 1015m2 = 3.1623 \u2217 107m\nwould be mass =\n(e) For Choice 3, all the other masses are very large.\n(f) Presumably one can get the masses (other than the electron) higher than this too. But the thorough exploration\nof the set of possible solutions does not look at all simple,\nand I shall not attempt any phenomenology here.\n5. The theory also appears to make sense in terms of counting\ndegrees of freedom, at least at first glance:\n(a) It appears that a big mass splitting between the electron\nand the other particles requires that the term P be very\nnear to one (note that 0 \u2264 P < 1 seems indicated by the\nform of the action) and that the closer it is, the greater\nthe splitting is.\n(b) It appears as though the closer P is to one, the greater\nthe gauge symmetry breaking is, in some sense. So it\nseems that the greater supersymmetry breaking requires\nthe greater gauge symmetry breaking. It would be nice\n25\n\n\f26\n\nto understand this better.\n(c) There are three J = 12 fermions, three J = 0 scalar\nbosons, and one J = 1 vector boson. The three fermions\nget mixed together to give three new masses. The third\nscalar mass arises from the longitudinal parts of the vector boson, and there is a mixing of the three scalars to\ngive three different masses for the scalars. The vector\nboson itself does not change mass when supersymmetry\nbreaks or when gauge symmetry breaks. Note that this\nis very different from the Higgs-Kibble-Guralnik mechanism in spontaneously broken gauge theories, though it\ndoes have some things in common too.\n(d) It is encouraging that seven masses arise from three parameters for one flavour, and that there are not more\nmasses than one could comfortably assign to particles.\nIf, for example, the fermion polynomial gave four masses\ninstead of three, that would be a disturbing result.\n(e) The above discussion is for one flavour, of course. For\nthree flavours, if all the matrices g, d, p and g, d, p are\ndiagonal at the same time, one simply repeats the above\npattern with different numbers for each flavour. In general however it is more complicated. The full result is\ngiven in [19], and that result needs analysis that looks\nrather challenging. There are also angles, and probably\nphases, to take care of in that case.\n6. It must be admitted that the necessary choice of parameters does not seem 'natural' in the technical sense\u2013it appears that some of the parameters must be chosen to be\nvery large or very small numbers. That is not surprising of\ncourse. The electron and neutrino masses are very small,\nand no supersymmetric partners have yet been discovered.\nSo the masses of the superpartners must be very large. On\n26\n\n\f27\n\nthe other hand, it is nice that this is at least possible, because of the special form of the polynomials that determine\nthe masses. Because the supersymmetry breaking has some\nfeatures in common with explicit breaking, there is no reason to expect any mass sum rules [23].\n7. It is tempting to wonder whether the dotspinor mass comes\nfrom the superstring in some way.\n12\nAn informal introduction to the development of\nthis mechanism\nThis paper had its origins in the effort by this author and\nsome collaborators to compute the cohomology of the chiral\nsupersymmetry model of Wess and Zumino [1] using spectral\nsequences [11].\nEarly results using just the chiral transformations, but without including Zinn sources, showed that the ghost charge one\nspace was huge, but largely consisted of objects with unsaturated spinor indices [10] [12] [13] [20] [21]. Other authors\nconcentrated on the cohomology without unsaturated spinor\nindices, because of course the action has no unsaturated spinor\nindices [8] [9].\nIt was clear that if anything interesting was going to happen\nin the sector with unsaturated spinor indices, one had to calculate the BRS cohomology including the Zinn sources [7]. It\nturns out that there is plenty of cohomology at ghost charge\nzero when the Zinn sources are included, and it is closely related\nto the ghost charge one cohomology. This will be discussed in\n[17].\nIt is well known [5] that the gauge anomalies can be formulated in the following way\n\u03b4BRS Action = Anomaly\n\n(97)\n27\n\n\f28\n\nwhere \u03b4BRS is the nilpotent BRS operator for the theory and\nAction is the usual integral of the Lagrangian, and Anomaly\nis an integrated local polynomial in the fields, with the same\nquantum numbers as the Action, except that it has ghost charge\none.\nThe natural question is whether the cohomology of supersymmetry gives rise to a comparable anomaly. It turns out\nthat the cohomology of the chiral Wess Zumino action at ghost\ncharge zero contains an infinite set of composite chiral dotted\nspinor superfields \u03c9b \u03b1\u0307 . There is also an infinite set of ghost\nc\nc\ncharge one composite objects of the form A\nC \u03b1\u0307 where A\nare\ncomposite chiral scalar superfields and C \u03b1\u0307 is the constant supersymmetry Weyl spinor ghost.\nBy analogy with the way that the usual chiral anomalies\nwork in (97), a supersymmetry anomaly would be expected to\nhave the form:\nc\nC \u03b1\u0307\n(98)\n\u03b4BRS \u03c9b \u03b1\u0307 = A\nThere were two immediate problems here:\n1. The first problem was to understand the BRS cohomology\nof the situation in detail and in full, including gauge theory,\nand that is very hard indeed. An effort to do this was made\nin [14] and the useful results from that will be used here and\nexplained in [17] and [18]. There is a pressing need for a\nbetter paper on this topic, but that paper is not easy to\nwrite, and it is likely to be impossible to read, and there\nare many unsolved problems and gaps. However, although\nthere is still much to learn, a large set of the possible \u03c9b \u03b1\u0307\nc\nand A\nC \u03b1\u0307 are now known.\n2. The other problem was to do a calculation of an anomaly\nif one exists. It gradually became fairly clear to the author\nthat supersymmetry anomalies like this did not seem to\narise in one-loop calculations.\n28\n\n\f29\n\nAt the same time, the results indicated that the composite\nchiral dotted spinor superfield operators of the form \u03c9b \u03b1\u0307 that\nwere in the cohomology space, were a very different kind of\noperator from the analogous gauge invariant operators in gauge\ntheories. In the supersymmetric theory, there is a constraint\nthat must be satisfied to make \u03c9b \u03b1\u0307 , and the existence of these\noperators has a fundamental dependence on the equations of\nmotion. There is nothing like \u03c9b \u03b1\u0307 in gauge theories without\nsupersymmetry.\nIt was then discovered that the standard supersymmetric\nmodel was a useful area to look at the composite chiral dotted spinor superfield operators of the form \u03c9b \u03b1\u0307 that were in the\ncohomology space. It turns out that the SSM has lots of examples of solutions of the constraint that \u03c9b \u03b1\u0307 must satisfy. Even\nmore interesting is the fact that this is related to the peculiar\nstructure of the SSM, with its direct products of groups and\nits left-right asymmetry [19].\nEven more remarkably, those examples of \u03c9b \u03b1\u0307 look like composite particles of a familiar kind. A first effort at making a\nfairly complete list of these was made in [15], but those results\nare incomplete, and the results in this paper and in [17] and\n[18] are more complete and more accurate. A more complete\nlist of these examples needs to be made, including proton and\nneutron type hadrons to start with.\nThe first real progress towards a result that has some physical\npredictions in it, was made after [15] was written. The author\nnoticed that there was actually something that looked just like\na supersymmetry anomaly, except that it had powers of the\nmass parameter in front of it, and also, it did not come from a\none-loop quantum calculation like the gauge anomalies in (97).\nInstead, it appeared at tree level when the gauge symmetry\n\n29\n\n\f30\n\nbreaking was turned on. It had the form\nc\nC \u03b1\u0307\n\u03b4BRS \u03c9b \u03b1\u0307 = mn A\n\n(99)\n\nwhere mn is some power of the mass parameter in the theory.\nThe question then was what to do with this result. The\nonly idea that came to the author was to convert the relevant\ncomposite fields to elementary effective fields while conserving\nthe same algebra (99), and then write down a Lagrangian field\ntheory for those fields with that invariance algebra. This yields\nan effective action. That creation of effective fields, an effective\nalgebra and an effective action, is the origin of cybersusy.\nThe effective BRS operator actually contains (98), but with\nelementary effective fields. The mass parameters must be removed as a result of the canonical dimensions that one needs\nfor the effective theory. Because the equation (98) really is\neffectively a supersymmetry anomaly, it is not surprising that\nthe effective action has some peculiar features from the point\nof view of supersymmetry.\nIt is also interesting and convenient that the dotspinors that\nare generated as effective fields do actually have a rather interesting and unusual action. Furthermore, that action fits well\ninto the idea that these dotspinors represent a new kind of supersymmetry multiplet corresponding to some supersymmetric\nset of bound states. These actions have not been used in supersymmetry before, as far as the author knows.\nBut the real surprise is that this effective action gives rise to\nanother issue, namely\u2013explicit supersymmetry breaking. If one\nstarts with the effective action with a zero vacuum expectation\nvalue, and tries to turn the VEV on while preserving supersymmetry in the effective action, one has to shut off the mass of the\ndotspinor. Any VEV at all is incompatible with any mass for\nthe dotspinor, if one wants to preserve supersymmetry. On the\n30\n\n\f31\n\nother hand, if the VEV is zero, then the dotspinor mass conserves supersymmetry. It is impossible to have the following\nthree things at the same time:\n1. a non-zero mass for the dotspinor,\n2. a non-zero VEV that breaks gauge symmetry, and\n3. unbroken supersymmetry.\nbut one can have any two of them.\nThis situation is a bit reminiscent of what happens with\ngauge anomalies, but there are also lots of differences. Gauge\nanomalies also arise from an incompatibility of requirements\nthat, naively at least, seem compatible.\nIt appears that the theory behaves very nicely no matter\nwhich two of the above three possibilities are chosen.\nIn particular if one chooses to give supersymmetry up, by\nkeeping a non-zero dotspinor mass, and keeping gauge symmetry breaking with a non-zero VEV, the theory still behaves\nnicely and supersymmetry breaking is generated in a unique\nway. The details and consequences of that have been explored\nin this paper. The result seems to be that a kind of minimal\nand unique explicit supersymmetry breaking is generated by\nthis procedure, and it is linked strongly to the SSM.\n13\n13.1\n\nConclusion\nSummary\n\nThis paper gives a brief survey of the results that are explained\nat greater length in the sequels [17] [18] [19].\nWe have seen that, using fairly reasonable assumptions, cybersusy yields a unique effective action for leptonic supersymmetry breaking. Furthermore that action yields a spectrum for\nthe leptons and their superpartners that is well defined, and\n31\n\n\f32\n\nwhich does not seem to get into any of the trouble that other supersymmetry breaking schemes encounter. The neutrino works\nidentically, and the baryons look rather similar, although more\ncomplicated. It remains to be seen whether similar methods\ncan deal with the other aspects of supersymmetry breaking,\nparticularly the baryons to start with.\n13.2\n\nSome Remarks about the name cybersusy\n\nThe name cybersusy is meant to refer to the complicated structure that underlies this method for understanding supersymmetry breaking. It is composed of words referring to the various\naspects involved, including such things as BRS cohomology,\ngauge and supersymmetry breaking, effective actions, and also\nretroversion in the context of supersymmetry. The retroversion\nrefers to the fact that the cohomology also generates a supersymmetric version of baryons, composed of quarks, which indicates that cybersusy is poised to give supersymmetric breaking\nin the baryonic mass spectrum, rather than that of quarks.\nThis is amusingly retroverted, because supersymmetry did\narise from the hadrons, through Regge trajectories, dual models, the string and the superstring [26]. It is not yet known\nwhether cybersusy gives reasonable results for the baryons, but\nfinding out is a straightforward (but laborious) extension of the\npresent results. Moreover there is a reasonable chance that it\nworks for baryons, because parts of that algebra are the same\nas the algebra here, and the observed baryons occupy positions\nin the baryonic algebra and effective action that are similar to\nthe position of the electrons in the present paper.\nCybersusy arises from the BRS cohomology of chiral supersymmetry as applied to the SSM. The relevant parts of that\ncohomology have been found using spectral sequences in Fock\nSpace. It is probably significant that the solution to the coho32\n\n\f33\n\nmology has been found using component fields, with the Zinn\nsources for the variations of the components, and with the auxiliaries integrated [17]. This removes manifest supersymmetry.\nIt appears to the author that this cohomology, which gives rise\nto the composite dotspinors, cannot be easily or locally expressed using superspace, and that it is probably very hard to\nrecover the same results using superspace.\nThe properties of the dotspinor superfields, and their strange\nquartic equations of motion, and the flexible formulation of the\nphilosophy of effective actions in section 4, are the origin of the\nsupersymmetry breaking in cybersusy. The dotspinors are also\nubiquitous in the BRS cohomology of the chiral superfield [17].\nThe SSM allows solutions of the BRS cohomology constraint\nequations for dotspinors, and these solutions are closely related\nto the particles we see [18]. It is also remarkable that the\nequations (9) and (10), which give rise to (25) and (26), are\nexactly what one would expect from the cohomology for an\nanomaly in the composite theory, except for the mass factors\nand the fact that no loop computation is needed.\nThe composite dotspinors that emerge from the cohomology\ndo transform like superfields, but they are certainly not composed of superfields [17]. The equations of motion, which are\nimplicit in the Zinn sources which are included in the composite\ndotspinors, play an essential role in the composite dotspinors\nand the constraints that they satisfy, and also in the new algebra that they generate after gauge symmetry breaking [18].\nIt is also noteworthy that although the new cybersusy algebra\nused in this paper to break supersymmetry can be expressed\nin terms of superfields, the action for the lepton mixing in this\npaper is non-local when expressed in superspace, and it also\ncontains explicit supersymmetry breaking factors of \u03b8 and \u03b8.\nIt seems simplest to deal with it using components fields.\n33\n\n\f34\n\nIt should be borne in mind that any correct result that is\nfound using components must be preferred, even if it conflicts\nwith some superspace prediction or understanding, because superspace is only a way of making the theory more compact. If\nthere is a conflict, we are forced to prefer the component formulation of supersymmetry. We seem to have come to a point\nwhere components are playing an important role again.\nIt should also be remembered that gauge anomalies can destroy unitarity in gauge theories, where the gauge invariance\nis a local symmetry. The 'effective supersymmetry anomalies'\nthat arise in the cybersusy algebra do indeed destroy supersymmetry, in their own special way, but since supersymmetry\nis not a local symmetry (as far as the standard supersymmetric\nmodel is concerned, at least), this does not cause any problem\nwith unitarity.\nFor the superstring, it is also necessary to write down effective actions to try to understand what is going on when one\nconsiders particles. It would be good to have some information\nflow between cybersusy and the superstring. Does the superstring give rise to the dotspinor masses?\n13.3\n\nDoes supersymmetry break when the vacuum condenses?\n\nWe have seen that the dotspinor mass term results in supersymmetry breaking, and that this breaking arises as soon as the\nVEV which breaks gauge symmetry becomes non-zero. In superspace notation, this dotspinor mass term, is, for one flavour:\nZ\n\u221a\n2\n(100)\nD m d4x d2 \u03b8 \u03c9\u0302 \u03b1\u0307L \u03c9\u0302\u03b1\u0307 R\nWe have also seen that there are choices of the parameters\nR, D, G such that the supersymmetry breaking is huge and\nsuch that the mass splitting between the electron (or neutrino),\nand the lowest mass superpartner, is probably as large as we\n34\n\n\f35\n\nwant. Moreover it seems to be natural to have the electron (or\nneutrino) as the lowest mass particle.\nIt is somewhat plausible that the early evolution of the universe actually took the course of this mechanism.\nOne could imagine that at very high temperatures, at some\nextremely short time after the Big Bang, before the condensation of the vacuum through the emergence of the VEV [25], the\nuniverse was described by the supersymmetric standard model,\npossibly together with other dotspinor masses from the superstring. That might imply infrared slavery, and so would imply\nthe existence of bound states. The cohomology of composite\noperators appears to be telling us the structure of the multiplets\nwhich could be expected to play the role of the bound states.\nThe cohomology also tells us how these bound state multiplets transform after gauge symmetry breaking occurs through\ncondensation. The cohomology for the baryons shows similar\nfeatures.\n13.4\n\nSome Puzzles\n\nHere are a few of the many features of this construction that\npuzzle the author:\n1. From the way this supersymmetry breaking works, it appears that the vacuum remains at a zero energy level even\nafter supersymmetry breaking. Is this correct?\n2. What can one say about heavy leptons, heavy neutral leptons, dark matter etc. in view of this mechanism?\n3. What would be an efficient way to look for evidence of this\nmechanism?\n4. What happens for the hadrons, all the baryons and mesons?\nEvidently it will be interesting to see if the model makes\nany sense when applied to these.\n35\n\n\f36\n\n5. What happens for the other particles, such as the Higgs and\nthe weak vector bosons and the photon?\n6. Can one extend the new action to an interacting action and\ncalculate radiative corrections? Or does one use the other\ndotspinors in the cohomology for that?\n7. What does this say about the superstring?\n8. Does the superstring set the scale for the mass parameters\nG and D and R? How?\n9. If this mechanism is correct, does that mean that supergravity is not broken? Could there be massless gravitinos?\n10. Do we get some useful information about bound states from\nthis construction? For example does it tell us something\nuseful about baryons?\n11. Does cybersusy fit well with inflation scenarios?\n12. How tightly is cybersusy bound to the SSM? Can it be\nextended to other models?\n13.5\n\nTheoretical Work to be Done\n\nIt would be interesting to study the mass spectrum of the\nhadrons, including the mesons, and to complete the cohomology with gauge theory included to see whether the vector bosons\nW +, W \u2212, Z and A, for example, behave in a proper way upon\nsupersymmetry breaking using the present ideas.\nJust using the present results about the cohomology of chiral\nsupersymmetry, one can test to see whether the superpartners\nof the baryons are heavier than the observed baryons, which is\nnecessary for the theory to agree with experiment.\nIt is fairly clear that there may be enough cohomology in the\ngauge theory (it works rather like the present case) to generate\na similar mechanism for the vector bosons. Assuming cybersusy\nexists for the gauge theory, then the tests are as follows:\n36\n\n\f37\n\n1. The gauginos and other superpartners of the vector bosons\nneed to be heavier than the gauge particles. This is necessary for the theory to agree with experiment.\n2. The superpartners of the hadronic mesons need to be heavier than the observed mesons. This is also necessary for the\ntheory to agree with experiment.\n3. For the Higgs mesons, it is not clear what is necessary for\nthe theory to agree with experiment, since they have not\nyet been seen. It is conceivable that the superpartners of\nthe scalar Higgs are lighter than the Higgs, as far as things\nstand at present.\nFrom the general BRS cohomology of chiral supersymmetry,\nwe also know that the dotspinor is certainly not the only relevant leptonic composite operator in the cohomology space for a\ngiven set of quantum numbers. What about the others? It does\nappear that any other relevant operators have more derivatives\n,\nin them, and are therefore suppressed by powers of momentum\nmass\nwhere the mass is likely to be very large. More work is needed\non the cohomology.\n13.6\n\nSynopsis of the next papers\n\nCybersusy is based on the BRS cohomology of composite operators in the Supersymmetric Standard Model (the SSM) with\nGauge Symmetry Breaking (GSB).\nFirst, in [17], we give an introduction to the BRS cohomology\nof the massless Wess Zumino chiral action for a superscalar\nmultiplet. Our main concentration here is on the existence of\nwhat we call simple composite dotspinor multiplets and their\nconstraint equations. These multiplets can only be discovered\nusing the cohomology, and are hidden from view if one uses\nsuperspace only.\n37\n\n\f38\n\nThen, in [18], we solve the constraint equations discussed\nin [17], using the massless supersymmetric standard model for\nthe example. We note that the solutions are familiar for the\nhadronic sector\u2013they closely resemble a supersymmetric quark\nmodel for the hadrons. For the leptonic sector, something analogous, but new, takes place.\nAlso in [18], we introduce the term which gives rise to the\nVacuum Expectation Value (VEV) which generates gauge symmetry breaking in the SSM, and note the new algebra generated by it among the leptonic composite dotspinor operators found in [18] (the leptons are simpler to analyze than\nthe hadrons). The VEV breaks the gauge symmetry from\nSU (3) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) to SU (3) \u00d7 U (1). As is well known\nin the SSM, before and after gauge symmetry breaking, the\ntheory exhibits unbroken supersymmetry for the elementary\nfields which appear in the action. And as long as supersymmetry is not spontaneously broken, the vacuum energy remains\nzero [24].\nThen in [19] we examine the effective action which arises from\nthe new algebra for the composite dotspinor fields and note that\nbecause of the dotspinor nature of some of the new effective\nfields, there is an induced explicit supersymmetry breaking in\nthe effective action as soon as the gauge symmetry breaking\noccurs. The polynomials referred to in section 10 of this first\npaper are derived from the cybersusy action in [19].\n13.7\n\nImplications for Experiment\n\nAt present, the author does not see how to efficiently go about\ndevising a test for these theoretical predictions, or how to\ndistinguish cybersusy experimentally from other methods for\nbreaking supersymmetry. These are very important questions,\nof course, particularly given the advent of the LHC at CERN.\n38\n\n\f39\n\nOf course, if experiments at the LHC could actually find the\n9 spin J = 12 leptonic fermions, and the 9 spin J = 21 leptonic\nscalar bosons, and the 3 spin J = 1 leptonic vector bosons,\nas predicted by cybersusy for the electron with three flavours,\nthen there would be significant correlations to be observed. We\nknow, that for one flavour, cybersusy predicts seven different\nmasses from the three real positive parameters G, D, R, and a\ncomparable statement must also be true for three flavours.\nAcknowledgments\nI thank J.C.
