This universal\nnature of quantum chaotic spectral correlations is numerically demonstrated for eigenvalues from\nrandom tight binding lattices and for zeros of the Riemann zeta function.\n\narXiv:quant-ph/0403206v1 29 Mar 2004\n\nPACS numbers: 05.45.Mt, 05.40.-a, 03.67.-a, 05.45.Pq\n\nOver the last couple of decades a general consensus\nhas emerged concerning remnants of classical chaos in\nquantum physics. Since the smooth and reversible quantum evolution allows no chaos what is nowadays called\nquantum chaos had to be traced elsewhere, usually in the\nstationary eigenvalues of a quantum system [1]. A key\nquantity which was introduced to distinguish between\nquantum chaos and quantum integrability is the distribution function of level-spacings between nearest eigenvalues [1, 2]. The quantum chaotic behavior is then defined as the resemblance of the level-spacing statistics to\nthose obtained from Gaussian random matrices having\nhighly correlated levels, which are described by random\nmatrix theory (RMT) [2, 3, 4, 5]. The major characteristic of quantum chaos is the so-called \"level-repulsion\"\nbetween energy levels which is due to the dramatic lowering of symmetries in chaotic systems, while the corresponding level-spacing distribution obeys the Wigner surmise. On the contrary, quantum systems with integrable\nclassical analogues are described by Poisson level-spacing\ndistribution function which implies uncorrelated random\nlevel-spacings with possible \"degeneracies\" related to the\npresence of symmetries. Quantum chaos has been experimentally observed for the irregular energy spectra in\natom-optics billiards [6, 7].\nThe present era of quantum computation, where the\nexploitation of quantum information resources came to\nthe forefront, requires a better understanding of spectral noise arising from quantum chaotic systems. This\nnoise could be related to quantum correlations, such as\nentanglement which is measured via von Neumann entropy and usually violates Bell inequalities [8, 9]. For\nsuch a purpose the energy level-spacing statistical distribution function is insufficient to describe fully a quantum system. In order to reveal more about the nature of\nquantum spectral noise one must examine level-to-level\ncorrelations. This was done in [10] where they conjecture that quantum chaotic energy spectra are character-\n\n\u2217 e-mail:\n\nsevagel@cc.uoi.gr\n\nized by 1/f noise, which is also verified by numerical\ndata [10]. In this paper we do not look only correlations\nbetween the enrgy eigenvalues but also view the nearest\nlevel-spacings as functions of their order, so that they can\nimitate discrete time series with their order corresponding to time. We provide evidence that in quantum chaos\nthe classically chaotic temporal evolution is replaced by\ndiffusion of the level-spacing dynamics. In other words,\nwe can interpret the evolution of level-spacings (not the\nenergies themselves) as that of fictitious particles executing random walks in one-dimensional space. Moreover,\nwe arrive at a more precise definition of quantum chaos\nwhich includes quantum correlations in addition to statistical behavior.\nThe energy level series of a quantum system make up\nan irregular continuous but non-differentiable self-affine\nfractal curve described by a fractal dimension D. For\nquantum chaotic levels the noisy curve is space filling\nwith D = 2 while for energy levels from quantum integrable systems the absence of correlations implies less\nirregular curves with fractal dimension D = 1.5. The\ncorresponding power-spectra P (f ) \u221d f \u2212\u03b1 are characterized by a power-law exponent \u03b1 which obeys the dimensional relation D = (5 \u2212 \u03b1)/2 [11]. Therefore, quantum chaos implies 1/f spectral noise with \u03b1 = 1 while\nquantum integrability gives 1/f 2 noise with \u03b1 = 2, respectively [10]. In order to provide a better understanding for the nature of correlations in quantum chaotic energy spectra we ask the question: \"What is the nature\nof correlations when dealing with the level-spacings, instead?\". Our main finding is that the correlations in the\nlevel-spacing sequences of quantum chaotic spectra are\nBrownian. Nevertheless, these are quantum correlations\nwhich occur in addition to the unpredictability associated to the classical chaotic behavior. Therefore, a link\ncan be established between quantum chaos and quantum correlations such as entanglement [8]. These facts\nare illustrated for two basic examples of quantum chaotic\nbehavior, the weakly disordered lattice and the Riemann\nzeros. Furthermore, quantum chaos is related to a Gaussian distribution for the level -spacing increments while\nquantum integrability is tight up to a Poisson distribu-\n\n\f2\n20\n\n3\n\n-20\n\n1\n\n3\n\nLog b\n\n4\n\n10\n\n600\n\n2\n1\n\nchaotic disordered\n\n1\n\n500\n\n2\n\n3\n\nLog b\n\n0\n\nLog Nb\n\n500\n\n1000\n\nn\n\n100\n\n1000\n\nchaotic Riemann\n\n3\n-2\n\n1/f\n\n10\n\n2\n1\n\n0\n\nf\n\n4\n-1\n\n0\n\n10\n\nD=1.4\n\n4\n\n50\n\n1/f\n\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n5\n\nintegrable\n\ncritical disordered 3/2\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1/f\n\n0\n\nD=1.1\n\n4\n\n2\n\n10\n10\n\n1\n\nP(f)\n\nLog Nb\n\n700\n\n-50\n\n2\n\n5\n\nquasi-integrable\n800\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n2\n1\n\nintegrable disordered\n\n4\n\n3\n\nP(f)\n\nLog Nb\n\n-10\n\n6\n\n10\n\nD=1.6\n\n4\n\n0\n\n\u220bn\n\n10\n\n5\n\nchaotic\n\n10\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nLog b\n1500\n\n4\n\n2000\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\nf\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Energy-level sequences \u03b5n with subtracted mean spacings for chaotic, integrable and quasiintegrable systems obtained from disordered and quasiperiodic lattices. The decreasing irregularity of the curves\ncan be seen with the space filling chaotic curve approaching\nD = 2, the integrable curve approaching D = 1.5 and D close\nto 1 for the chosen quasi-integrable model. The dimensions\nshown in the figure differ from the expected values since they\nwere obtained by box-counting algorithms which are usually\nnot very accurate for such self-affine curves. Quantum correlations exist in (a) for the maximally noisy quantum chaotic\ncurves. The quantum correlations die out in (b),(c).\n\ntion, respectively. This allows a simple description of the\nintegrability to chaos transition as a change of the levelspacing increments from the discrete rare event Poisson\ndistribution to the continuous Gauss distribution.\nIn Fig. 1 energy level signals from electrons in lattices\nas a function of the level-index n are displayed.

The chaotic, quasiintegrable and integrable energy-level series can be seen\nto display very different curve roughness. Very rough\ncurves with D approaching 2 are obtained for chaotic\nlevels, the roughness is smaller with D close to 1.5 for\nintegrable ones while it becomes much lower, closer to\nD = 1, for the studied quasi-integrable system where\nthe corresponding curve approaches a line.

We show the energy\nlevels from weakly disordered solids and Riemann zeroes\nwhich give 1/f noise. Our findings for the presence of\n1/f power-spectra for quantum chaotic levels agree with\nthe conjecture of Ref. [10]. We emphasize that quantum\ncorrelations exist only for the maximally noisy spectrum\nof quantum chaotic levels of Fig. 1(a). The integrable\nsystem of Fig. 1(c) does not show any correlations described by a less rough curve with Brownian 1/f 2 noise.\nThe quasi-integrable system of Fig. 1(b) does not display\nany quantum correlations either. Below we shall demonstrate that Brownian noise describes quantum correlations for chaotic systems not for the energy levels but for\nthe level-spacing sequences, instead.\nThe 1/f noise found to describe the quantum chaotic\nlevels is a common law for many classical complex phenomena where very rare intense effects require the cooperation of various favorable cases. It can be also viewed\nas a scaling law since a change of the intensity combined\nwith contraction in time leaves its form unchanged. The\n1/f law is very old and appears in many cases ranging from fluid flows, stock market price indices, earthquakes, etc. [12]. However, despite of its generality its\norigin remains a mystery without any widely accepted\ngeneral mechanism for its interpretation. The most common explanation of 1/f noise relies on the extension of\nLorentzian correlation function \u03b3/(\u03c9 2 + \u03b3 2 ) from usual\nrandom telegraph noise of a single fluctuator with exponential relaxation \u03b3, to several fluctuators with a broad\ndistribution of relaxation rates. Although hard to justify physically if log(\u03b3) is uniformly distributed the average over Lorentzians with the chosen broad distribution\nof \u03b3's gives 1/f noise [13]. Another mechanism of 1/f\nnoise seems more appropriate for quantum chaotic lev-\n\n\f3\n0.6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n4\n\nintegrable\n\npoisson\n\nGauss\nGauss\nPoisson\n\n0.4\n\nP(Sn-Sn-1)\n\nquasi-integrable\n\nSn\n\nsemi-poisson\n\n0.5\n\nchaotic unitary\nchaotic orthogonal\nintegrable\nP(Sn-Sn-1)\n\nchaotic\n\nwigner\n\n0.3\n\n1\nquasi\n0.8 integrable\n\ne\n\n0.6\n\n-2x\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\nSn-Sn-1\n\n0.2\n\n2\n\n0.1\n\nP(S)\n\n10000\n\n10500\n\n11000\n\nn\n\n11500\n\n0\n12000\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Level-spacing sequences Sn with unit\nmean-level spacing hSi = 1 for chaotic, quasi-integrable and\nintegrable systems.

[14]) that a\npossible origin of 1/f noise can be Brownian correlated\ninterevents between narrow pulses. Therefore, in order to\nobtain 1/f noise for the chaotic levels \u03b5n the corresponding level-spacings Sn which appear in Eq. (1) should\nfollow a Brownian random walk and the level -spacing\nincrements (spacings of spacings) Sn \u2212 Sn\u22121 to be random uncorrelated having white type of noise. This can be\nunderstood rather easily since Brownian 1/f 2 noise of the\nlevels arises from uncorrelated f 0 white noise of the levelspacings, similarly 1/f noise observed for chaotic levels\ncan arise from uncorrelated white noise level-spacing increments.\nOur main results for the level-spacing series Sn =\n\u03b5n \u2212 \u03b5n\u22121 are displayed in Fig. 3 together with the corresponding level-spacing distributions P (S) on the left\nof the figure. It is well-known that from the chaotic series the obtained P (S) obeys the Wigner surmise, the\nless irregular integrable series is described by a Poisson distribution, while the quasi-integrable ones follow\nan intermediate semi-Poisson distribution [15]. The difference between the amount of noise displayed in the various cases is immediately obvious. In order to show that\nquantum correlations are included in the chaotic levelspacings which follow Brownian motion we have looked\nat the statistical distribution of the level-spacing differences Sn \u2212 Sn\u22121 . For chaotic levels it should be Gaussian\nand for integrable levels of Poisson type which correspond\nto correlated and uncorrelated levels, respectively. The\ntwo behaviors are clearly distinguished in Fig. 4. We\nhave verified this picture by computing all the levels, the\nlevel-spacings and the increments of level-spacings in lattice models and the Riemann zeros.

The quasi-integrable system\nshown in the inset is described by the simple Poisson e\u22122x .\n\nFor weakly disordered lattices where \u03b2 = 1 and 30000\nRiemann zeroes [16] where \u03b2 = 2 the data can be described by simple Gauss distributions for both cases. In\nthe integrable case the statistics is Poisson while a similar result of different Poisson type is obtained for the\nquasi-integrable statistics in the inset.\nWe summarize our numerical computations of eigenvalues responsible for the level-spacings. First, we consider\nthe weakly disordered Anderson model studied on L3\nsites of a 3D lattice. The diagonal matrix elements of the\ncorresponding are random taken from a uniform probability distribution of zero mean and variance W 2 /12\nand the off-diagonal matrix elements connecting nearest neighbors are unity. The short ranged and sparse\nreal symmetric matrices are diagonalized to obtain long\nenough signals of raw eigenvalues En . For such purpose\nthe Lanczos algorithm was employed and the scaling behavior is achieved by considering linear lattice size up to\nL = 25 for many random configurations. In the unfolding procedure one replaces each level-spacing En+1 \u2212 En\nby \u03b5n+1 \u2212 \u03b5n = N (En+1 ) \u2212 N (En ), where \u03b5n = N (En )\nare the unfolded levels, with N (E) the averaged integrated density of states. In this procedure the mean levelspacing becomes hSi = 1 throughout the spectrum. We\nhave taken linear size L = 25 for the chaotic levels disorder W = 10 for 57 random configurations total of 147000\neigenvalues, for the critical levels disorder Wc = 16.5\nfor 80 random configurations total of 140000 eigenvalues\nand the integrable case disorder W = 30 total of 10763\nrandom configurations total of 102800 eigenvalues. The\naveraged power spectra which are shown in Fig. 2 for an\n\n\f4\nenergy window [0, 2] which include approximately 2000\neigenvalues. We have estimated the power spectrum laws\n\u03b1 = 2.0 \u00b1 0.07 for the chaotic case, \u03b1 = 1.52 \u00b1 0.04 for\nthe integrable case while a law close to \u03b1 = 1.62 \u00b1 0.08\nwas found for the critical case (not shown).\nWe have also diagonalized a simpler critical model replacing the critical case of 3D disordered systems to consider the behavior at the borderline from integrability\nto chaos. This is the one-dimensional quasi-integrable\nHarper model [15] where the site\n\u221a potential is Vn =\n2 cos(2\u03c0\u03c3n) with irrational \u03c3 = ( 5 \u2212 1)/2. This model\ndisplays critical behavior with multifractal spectra and\nwave functions. We find that the averaged power spectra\ngave power-law estimates close to \u03b1 = 3.3 to 3.8 as the\nsystem size increased. The level-spacings of adjacent Riemann complex zeroes [16] also exhibit fluctuations similar to the ones of the energy spectra of electrons in disordered lattices. The Riemann hypothesis P\nstates that\nall non-trivial zeros of the Riemann \u03b6(s) = s ns function have real part equal to 1/2 with \u03b6n = 1/2 + \u03b5n .\nAlthough numerical computations agree with Riemann\nhypothesis a full theoretical proof is not known. However, the RMT is believed to be valid in this case so that\nthe spectrum of Riemann zeros represents a hypothetical\nquantum chaotic system in the unitary universality class\ndescribed by GUE, which corresponds to broken timereversal invariance via a magnetic field. The P (S) statistics for small S in this case is \u221d S \u03b2 with \u03b2 = 2, compared\nto \u03b2 = 1 for the orthogonal case of disordered systems.\nIn RMT language we have a crossover from GOE to GUE\nstatistics. In Fig. 2 we demonstrate 1/f noise also for\nsequences of the Riemann zeroes. We summarize that\nour findings for fractal fluctuations and 1/f noise for the\nchaotic spectra are linked to quantum fluctuations.\nIt is reasonable to expect that fingerprints of chaos\npresent in the classical time evolution can be also found\nin the stationary energy levels of the corresponding quantum system. In addition to classical chaos the chaotic\nspectra should also contain some form of quantum correlations. Therefore, it is worth searching for the two ingredients of quantum chaos: \"correlations\" for the quantum\npart and \"randomness\" for the chaotic part. We find\nthat both appear in the self-affine fractal noise of the\nspectral curves which is exemplified via the random walk\nbehavior found for the level-spacings. Although quantum evolution is very different from that of classical point\nparticles in phase space Brownian diffusion also occurs in\nthe quantum case. In Hilbert space level-spacing evolution is important, which seems to play the same role for\nquantum chaos as the time evolution in phase space for\nclassical chaos. Moreover, quantum chaos implies random uncorrelated level-spacing increments which obey a\nGaussian distribution. In other words, quantum memory effects in the evolution, such as dependence on the\ninitial wave packet superpositions, eventually die out for\n\nthe level-spacing increments where quantum chaos meets\nclassical chaos. The quantum chaotic level-spacing increments obey Gauss distribution distinguished from integrable ones which obey Poisson distribution.\nWe have resolved numerically important issues concerning the nature of spectral correlations and noise in\nquantum chaos. Common signatures of quantum chaos\nsuch as \"level-repulsion\" and \"spectral rigidity\" arise\nfrom quantum \"correlations\" which appear in chaotic\nlevel-spacings. If combined with \"randomness\", which\nmight have a classical chaotic origin, make up what we\ncall quantum chaos. On the other hand, integrability\nusually concerns uncorrelated random levels where the\nlevel-spacings obeys the Poisson distribution. We should\nadd that integrability occurs either for pure ballistic systems where quantum correlations exist without randomness or strongly disordered systems where due to localization in random positions randomness exists without\ncorrelations since localized wave functions do not communicate. Quantum chaos requires both ingredients, \"quantum correlations\" and \"randomness\", simultaneously, for\nexample both of them are present in RMT spectra.\nIn summary, starting from the identification of proposed 1/f spectral fluctuations in quantum chaos numerical evidence was given in favor of random walk behavior\nfor the level-spacings. We also argued that the definition of quantum chaos requires both \"quantum correlations\" and \"randomness\". Our numerical study suggests\na connection between chaotic motion of classical particles in phase space and motion of the level-spacings between eigenvalues in Hilbert space. In the quantum case\nBrownian correlations are shown to contribute to quantum effects. Although the level-spacing distribution is\nwidely accepted as the best diagnostic tool of quantum\nchaos there is no direct theory attached to it, as it exists\nfor example for other level correlation functions via RMT\n(see however the recent study of [17]). This might explain\nwhy the simple random walk behavior of level-spacings\nin quantum chaotic systems, where quantum correlations\nand unpredictable behavior are combined was not paid\nmuch attention before.\n\n[1] M.V.
