A re urrent problem in the statisti al analysis of su h data sets\nis that while no sophisti ated methods are needed to as ertain the meaning of\nthe few high quality elements, the bulk of the data often lies near the noise\n\u001door, where fairly fan y statisti al tools may be ome ne essary.\n\nIn su h\n\nir-\n\numstan es, seemingly inno uous improvements to data treatment may yield\nlarge improvements to the analysis simply be ause of the way the data quality\nis distributed.\nAmong the many experimental te hniques generating large datasets from\nbiologi al experiments today, oligonu leotide hybridization arrays have rapidly\nbe ome a popular tool for large s ale gene expression s reens[1, 2\u2104. Currently,\nDNA hybridization array te hniques aim at obtaining several thousand low quality measurements of trans ript abundan e in a single parallel experiment. From\n\n1\n\n\fthis \u0010bulk\u0011 data, the goal is to identify groups of genes parti ipating in a given\npathway and hopefully unravel some features of their trans riptional regulation,\nto be\n\non\u001crmed by more sensitive and pre ise methods.\n\nThere are\n\nurrently two main trends in mi roarray te hnology,\n\nDNA bi-\n\nolor glass slides [3, 4\u2104 and the high-density oligonu leotide arrays (HDONAs)\nmanufa tured by A\u001bymetrix [5, 6\u2104.

The meaningful information\nlies in the ratios of intensities for the same hybridization sequen e taken from\ndi\u001berent samples.\nunsyn hronized\n\nUsually one thinks of one sample (e.g.\n\nells) as a baseline to whi h all other\n\nIn what follows, we\n\n'normal' tissue or\n\nonditions are\n\nompared.\n\non entrate ex lusively on HDONAs. On these, probe\n\nells (or features) are grouped into probe sets for a given gene, a probe set\n\non-\n\nsisting of\n\n\u223c 20\n\nof probe\n\nells). Ea h pair is designed to probe a di\u001berent 25 base sequen e (the\n\n(depending on the gene and the\n\nidentity of whi h is not\nhe k for non-spe i\u001c\nMat h)\n\nell\n\nMat h)\n\nell whose\n\nhip series) probe pairs (pairs\n\nurrently revealed by A\u001bymetrix) from the gene.

To generate an absolute intensity measure (Avg Di\u001b ), this algorithm\nsubtra ts the MM from the PM intensity for ea h probe pair (an attempt to\norre t for the non-spe i\u001c\n\nhybridization and ba kground), and the obtained\n\ndi\u001beren es are then arithmeti ally averaged after trun ation of the largest and\nsmallest values [5, 7\u2104.\nWe propose an improved method for obtaining\n\nomposite ratios (and inten-\n\nsities) of trans ript abundan e between two samples, based on a study of the\nstatisti al distribution of individual\n\nell ratios within ea h probe set.\n\nA few\n\nideas guided our approa h: (i) the experimental proto ol is designed su h that\nthe hybridization is kineti ally dominated; (ii) data distributed on an exponential s ale should not be averaged algebrai ally but geometri ally. Having these\nin mind, we show how the study of raw A\u001bymetrix data (.CEL \u001cles) leads to\nan algorithm whose essential ingredients are: (i) MM\n\nells are not utilized as\n\nontrols for non-spe i\u001c ity, we use them only for the\n\nal ulation of the ba k-\n\nground intensity; (ii) outliers need to be dis arded; (iii) averages are taken in\nlog- oordinates. Signi\u001c ant advantages over the\n\nurrent A\u001bymetrix software in-\n\nlude (i) the ability to obtain reliable s ores for a greater proportion of genes\n\n2\n\n\f(+30%), espe ially in the mid to low intensity range; (ii) repli ate experiments\nshow greater reprodu ibility (i.e.\n\ntighter s atter plots); (iii) ratio s ores for\n\ngenes probed twi e or more on the mi roarray show a vastly in reased\ntion (there are\nseries).\n\n\u223c 700\n\nsu h genes on the\n\norrela-\n\nombined Mu11k A and B mouse\n\nhip\n\nIn the remaining, we demonstrate how this pro edure emerges from\n\nstudying the data sets, and report eviden e for the improvements.\n\nRaw intensities and ba kground subtra tion\nThe starting point in our analysis of HDONAs\ntensities of all the 25-base probes on the\n\nonsists of the \u001duores ent in-\n\nhip, in luding both the PM and MM\n\nells (.CEL \u001cles). This data has already gone through one pro essing step by\nA\u001bymetrix, namely an average of the pixel intensities (36 pixels per\nMu11k mouse\n\nhip) for ea h probe\n\nell.\n\nBefore moving on to\n\nell for the\n\nonsider whi h\n\nprobes belong to whi h gene, it is instru tive to inquire about the reprodu ibility of the raw data in repli ate experiments. The\n\nigar shaped\n\nloud in Fig. 1(a)\n\nshows su h a typi al example. In an ideal (noiseless) experiment, the s atter plot\nof the repli ates should produ e a single straight line with unit slope, so that the\nbroadening of the line in a real experiment re\u001de ts the noise. In HDONAs, this\nnoise has multiple sour es, in luding intrinsi\n\nbiologi al and sample pro essing\n\nvariability, hybridization kineti s and thermodynami s, noise related to the inorporation and ampli\u001c ation of \u001duores ent dyes, and the measurement of the\n\u001duores en e in the s anning pro ess[7\u2104. Despite all these potential sour es, the\nexperimental situation is en ouraging as indi ated by the high reprodu ibility\nin (a).\nThe intensity dependen e of the noise envelope is\n\nommonly referred to as\n\nthe noise funnel. In Fig. 1(a), the funnel is only very weakly intensity dependent. We observe that the onset of the intensities is shifted from zero to\nindi ating that\n\nell intensities have an additive ba kground\n\n\u223c 500,\n\nomponent. Esti-\n\nmating this ba kground intensity is essential when pro essing low intensity data\npoints. In HDONAs, identifying ba kground is a priori a di\u001berent problem from\nits analogue in\n\nDNA spotted arrays. There, one tries to measure the intensity\n\nof regions in between adja ent spots as a measure for the lo al ba kground. In\nontrast, the inter-feature distan e in A\u001bymetrix arrays is too small for a similar measurement and one must estimate the ba kground from the probe\n\nells\n\nthemselves. Ba kground is by de\u001cnition non-spe i\u001c , and should therefore not\nbe sensitive to the single base sequen e modi\u001c ation in the MM\nquently, we\n\nells.

It turns\n\nonsistently that noisier\n\nells are automati ally dis arded, however, not on\n\nthe basis of an evaluation of the funnel shape ( f. Probe\n\nell sele tion).\n\nConstru ting good estimators\nThe previous dis ussion about ba kground intensity distributions raises the following general issue: what are good estimators for data drawn from an unknown\ndistribution? The answer involves \u001cnding the\n\noordinates in whi h the distri-\n\nbution is most well behaved. In the best situation, a distribution is short tailed,\nwhi h ensures that moments are not only well de\u001cned but are also relevant\nquantities for a statisti al des ription of the data set.\ntailed distributions (e.g.\nthe situation is more\n\nIn a situation of long\n\ndriven by a large number of outliers in a dataset),\n\nompli ated. Then, one either needs to establish a model\n\ndes ribing how one should trun ate the dataset before\n\nal ulating averages, or\n\nwork with estimators whi h are more robust to outliers, like per entiles.\nformulate this more pre isely, we\nhave\n\nn\n\nsamples from a positive distribution\n\ndistribution\n\n\u03bbp(x/\u03bb).\n\nTo\n\nonsider the following problem: suppose we\n\np(x),\n\nand samples from the s aled\n\nThe problem is to \u001cnd the optimal estimator for\n\n\u03bb.\n\nThe\n\nlearly shall depend on p. If p is a well behaved distribution, then\nPn\nh\u03bbp(x/\u03bb)i/hp(x)i (hxi = n1 i=1 xi denotes the arithmeti average) is a \u001cne\nestimator; but it miserably fails if p is long tailed. Conversely, the median is a\nsolution\n\nsuboptimal estimator in the\n\nase of well behaved distributions, but it has the\n\nadvantage of being more robust in the long tailed\n\nase.\n\nDatasets from HDONAs do exhibit su h long tails, as we show in Fig. 2. The\n\nlog2 PM intensity distributions of all probe sets,\nell being normalized by their probe set median.

Nevertheless, log- oordinates lead to roughly symmetri\n\ndistri-\n\nbutions, at least up to the last intensity window. We think of these distributions\nas the sum of a well behaved\n\nomponent (with\n\nonverging moments to whi h\n\nthe Central Limit Theorem applies), plus a long tailed part due to outliers.\nThese need to be identi\u001ced ( f.

These emphasize\nthe reprodu ibility of the broad intensity pro\u001cles.\n\nThe mysterious MM ells\nBefore explaining how to dis ard outliers and\nwhy we do not utilize the MM\n\nompute a ratio s ore, we explain\n\nells for the\n\nand ratio s ores.

Noti e that (a) presents the raw\nsities, whereas (b) reports the distributions of\n\nell inten-\n\nomposite intensities obtained by\n\nonsidering the PM and MM probe sets as if they were two di\u001berent\n\nonditions\n\nfor the same gene. It is somewhat disturbing that in the high intensity region,\nthe\n\nloud (a) exhibits a valley around the diagonal. This means that there is a\n\nsigni\u001c ant number of probes where the target\nthe MM (in\n\nontrast, non-spe i\u001c\n\nRNAs bind more spe i\u001c ally to\n\nhybridization would result in a maximum on\n\nthe diagonal). A possible s enario for this matter are polymorphisms between\nthe mouse spe ie used to design the probe sequen es and that used as the target.\nIn su h instan es, the MM may a tually a t as the e\u001be tive PM, however, these\nshould be rare events sin e the MM sequen e is always substituted exa tly at\nthe\n\nentral position.\nIn any\n\nase, subtra ting the MM from the PM intensities is likely to be\n\nmisleading, and we found it favorable to not\n\nonsider the MM\n\nells any further.\n\nAs a matter of fa t, it is not entirely surprising that a single base\nnot provide a\n\nlear\n\nut dis rimination for non-spe i\u001c\n\nhange does\n\nhybridization in a pro ess\n\ndominate by kineti s rather that equilibrium thermodynami s.\n\nProbe ell sele tion and ratio omposites\nWe now des ribe our algorithm for the sele tion of\nof ratios. We observed that\n\nells used in the\n\ntwo di\u001berent samples leads to series of pairwise PM\n\nells ratios\n\nbehaving quite far from an ideal homogeneous situation (all\nInstead, the individual\nsome\n\nal ulation\n\nomparing two identi al probe sets hybridized to\n\nri\n\n(r1 , r2 , . . . , rN )\n\nbeing the same).\n\nell ratios often vary over a de ade; it also o\n\nurs that\n\nells indi ate an up-regulation whereas others indi ate the opposite ( f.\n\nFig. 4 ( ) and (d)). In this situation, a straightforward linear regression between\nPM intensities of the two samples is not adequate. It further happens that high\nintensity\n\nells saturate in one or both of the samples, leading to useless (even\n\nmisleading)\n\nell ratios. Su h probe\n\nells are dis arded from our analysis.

Instead, the low intensity\n\ndistributed among the probe sets, whi h is\n\nells are\n\nlearly re\u001de ted in Fig. 1( ) by the\n\nlow density of points at the low end.\n\nResults\nTo demonstrate the potential of our method, we analyzed a set of HDONA hybridizations evaluating the trans riptional pro\u001cles of six di\u001berent mouse brain\nregions using the Mu11k mouse A and B\nzymati\n\nsteps (making the target\n\nhip series. The disse tions and en-\n\nRNA) were performed in dupli ate in all\n\nexperiments and the two obtained samples were hybridized onto separate arrays. Fig. 5A shows the s atter plots of the repli ates from four brain regions,\nthe A and B\n\nhips being superimposed on the same plot.\n\nOur s ores exhibit a mu h tighter s atter, espe ially in the mid to low intensity range.\n\nFurther, we are able to report s ores for all the genes on the\n\narrays, whereas the A\u001bymetrix algorithm reports non-negative values (negative\nintensities are meaningless and not plotable on a logarithmi\n\ns ale) for\n\n\u223c 70% of\n\nthe probe sets. As mentioned, the reason we obtain relatively few low intensity\ngenes (2\u03c3 of residual ba kground\n\n\u223c 100 in these units) is that low intensity\n\nells\n\ntend to be distributed among di\u001berent probe sets rather than being grouped.\n\nlog2 ratios from the\nombined regions in intensity windows. Our distributions are well \u001ctted\n\nThe histograms in Fig. 5B show the distributions of the\nfour\n\n6\n\n\f\u03c3 \u223c 0.2 for intensities > 300.\n\u223c 1.25.

Next,\nwe\n\nontrast a repli ate experiment Fig. 6(a) with a\n\nexperimental\n\nonditions Fig. 6(b).

Taking\na fa tor less\n\ndistributions produ ed by the\n\nurrent A\u001bymetrix algorithm.\n\nSummary\nWe presented an improved approa h for\n\nomputing\n\nomposite ratio s ores for\n\nhigh-density oligonu leotide arrays. Our new method di\u001bers signi\u001c antly from\nthe\n\nurrent A\u001bymetrix algorithm in the following manner: (i) MM\n\nin luded be ause their information\ndi\u001berent samples are derived from\n\nomparing the PM\n\nand then identifying a subset of probe\ns ores; (iii) geometri\n\nells are not\n\nontent is un lear; (ii) ratios between two\nell intensities pairwise,\n\nells leading to optimally\n\nonsistent\n\naverages are used be ause the intensity and ratios of\n\nprobe sets are distributed on a exponential s ale. We showed that our method\na ts as a noise redu ing \u001clter in the sense that (i) repli ate experiments show an\nin reased reprodu ibility; (ii) ratio s ores for probe sets probing the same gene\nshow a mu h greater\n\norrelation. We emphasized that be ause the distribution\n\nof intensities within a probe set is often mu h broader than the distribution\n\n7\n\n\fof\n\nell ratios taken from a pairwise\n\nomparison, the most reliable information\n\nlies in ratio and not in absolute intensity\nour algorithm to primarily\n\ns atterplots) always dependent upon a\nOur method should be\n\nomposites. Therefore, we designed\n\nompute ratios, and reported intensities (e.g.\n\nin\n\nomparison.\n\nonsidered as a the simplest way to extra t the most\n\ninformation from just two hybridization arrays, therefore allowing bene\u001cts from\nworking with small data sets of very homogeneous quality. In\n\nontrast, the more\n\ninvolved model-based approa h[8\u2104 requires large data sets for\n\nalibration, and\n\nis therefore more sensitive to the variability introdu ed by slight\n\nhanges in the\n\nexperimental proto ol. Further, knowledge of the probe sequen es would enable\none to develop more elaborate approa hes based on the kineti\nnami\n\nand thermody-\n\nproperties of the probes.\n\nWe have applied our method to a large mi roarray data set studying the\nneurogenesis in adult mi e brains, whi h lead to highly signi\u001c ant biologi al\nresults[9\u2104. The generated data sets ould be lustered robustly using standard hierar hi al te hniques. Finally, the fa t that MM\n\nells are not expli itely needed\n\nopens the possibility of s reening twi e as many genes on a given mi roarray.\nConsidering that the\n\nurrent estimates about the number of genes in the human\n\ngenome predi t fewer than\n\n40, 000\n\ngenes, it is not unrealisti\n\nto expe t single\n\narrays for all human genes in the near future.\nWe thank E. van Nimwegen for suggesting many interesting ideas.
