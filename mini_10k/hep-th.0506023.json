However, spacetimes are typically presented and visualized in a specific coordinate\nsystem. If the coordinates are poorly chosen, many properties of the spacetime such as\nhorizons, causally connected spacetime points, maximal extensions and null infinity are not\nreadily apparent.\n1\n\n\fA simplification occurs if a D dimensional Lorentzian spacetime has enough fibered directions (like a (D \u2212 2)-sphere) or other ignorable directions. One can draw two dimensional\ndiagrams for the remaining directions and such Lorentzian \u2212+ signature spacetime slices\ncan be conformally compactified leading to Penrose diagrams.\nPenrose diagrams are quite useful in understanding spacetime geometry and successful\nespecially in understanding causal structure although there are some limitations to this\napproach. For instance just knowing the Penrose diagram for the subextremal Q2 < M 2\nReissner-Nordstr\u00f8m black hole does not tell us what happens to the spacetime structure\nin the chargeless or extremal limits. For more complicated spacetimes, Penrose diagrams\n(which assume symmetry or fibering) can only draw a slice of the spacetime. As a known\nexample, the Penrose diagram for a Kerr black hole does not clearly depict the ring singularity\nand the possibility of crossing through the interior of the ring into a second universe. In\naddition, recently analytic continuation has been applied to black hole solutions to yield\nbubble-type [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] or S-brane [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]\nsolutions. Oftentimes this is done in Boyer-Lindquist type coordinates which are hard to\nvisualize. Again we are not left with a clear picture of the resulting spacetime and the\nPenrose diagrams are missing important noncompact spatial directions.\nIt is useful to have an alternative diagram which can also capture important features of a\nspacetime. For this reason in this paper we expand the notion of drawing spacetimes in Weyl\nspace [21, 22]. Because our diagrams have the appearance of playing cards glued together\nwe will dub them Weyl card diagrams.\nTo understand the construction of a card diagram we recall that in D = 4 dimensions a\nWeyl solution in canonical coordinates [22, 23, 24] is written as\nds2 = \u2212f dt2 + f \u22121 [e2\u03b3 (d\u03c12 + dz 2 ) + \u03c12 d\u03c62 ]\nwhere f and \u03b3 are functions of \u03c1, z. The original Weyl class requires two commuting orthogonal Killing fields \u2202t , \u2202\u03c6 in four dimensions [23], or D \u2212 2 fields for general D dimensions [22].1\nSometimes Weyl solutions are called axially-symmetric gravitational solutions although they\nin fact are more general. We also include the Weyl-Papapetrou class for 2 commuting Killing\nvectors in D = 4 [26], and allow charged static solutions in D \u2265 4 (see the Appendix to\nthis paper). Furthermore stationary vacuum solutions in D \u2265 4 are covered with the recent work of [27]. In four and five dimensions this generalized Weyl class includes spinning\ncharged black holes and rings [22, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34] as well as various arrays\n[15, 20, 35] of black holes, spacelike-branes, and includes backgrounds like Melvin fluxbranes\n[15, 20, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40] and spinning ergotubes [41].\n1\n\nNon-Weyl, axisymmetric spacetimes in D \u2265 4 are discussed in [21, 25].\n\n2\n\n\fWhen constructing card diagrams, we will draw only Weyl's canonical coordinates (\u03c1, z),\nor coordinates related to them via a conformal transformation. The Killing coordinates are\nignorable and so this diagram is efficient and will show all details of the spacetime. Since\nthere are only two nontrivial coordinates, card diagrams are two dimensional and easy to\ndraw like Penrose diagrams. The difference however is that while Penrose diagrams are\ntruly two-dimensional, card diagrams are drawn as if embedded in three dimensions. When\na (\u03c1, z) region of the spacetime has Euclidean ++ signature, we draw the two coordinates\n(\u03c1, z) horizontally; and this makes a horizontal card. For Lorentzian signature \u2212+ regions\nwe use (\u03c1\u2032 , z) or (\u03c4, \u03c1), and draw the timelike coordinate vertically; this makes a vertical\ncard. Causal structure is automatically built into the vertical cards since for example the\ndirections (\u03c4, \u03c1) appear conformally only through the combination \u2212d\u03c4 2 + d\u03c12 . Horizontal\ncards and vertical cards are attached together at Killing horizons and so card diagrams\nresemble a gluing-together of a house of playing cards.\nIn this paper we will present card diagrams for the familiar spacetimes of black holes, as\nwell as expanding bubbles, S-branes, and black rings. Many other spacetimes including the Sdihole, infinite periodic universe, C-metric, and multiple-rod solutions in 4 and 5 dimensions\nare presented in [20], and spacetimes derived from 4 and 5 dimensional Kerr geometries will\nbe presented in [42].\nIn Section 2 we review the Schwarzschild black hole in the usual coordinates and in Weyl\ncoordinates. By extending through the horizon and properly representing the interior of the\nblack hole we construct the first card diagram. We emphasize the construction of the interior\nof the black hole as a vertical card comprised of four triangles unfolded across special null\nlines. We then discuss general card diagram properties such as null lines, list the available\ncard types, and geometrically describe the \u03b3-flip analytic continuation procedure.\nIn Section 3, we discuss the sub/super/extremal Reissner-Nordstr\u00f8m black hole card diagrams, the Kerr black hole, and the black ring/C-metric card diagrams. We then show\nthat a spacetime can have multiple card diagrams and as examples present the elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic representations of the charged Witten bubble and charged Spacelike\nbrane which we also call S-Reissner-Nordstr\u00f8m. Finally, as a newer example we discuss the\n(twisted) S-Kerr solution [16, 17].\nWe conclude with a discussion in Section 4. We give an appendix on perturbing Witten\nbubbles and S-branes by introducing Israel-Khan rods, in their hyperbolic or elliptic representations. We also give an appendix on how the higher dimensional vacuum Weyl Ansatz\ncan be extended to include electromagnetic fields.\nThis paper is a condensed presentation of the card diagrams in [20].\n\n3\n\n\f2\n\nSchwarzschild and general card diagrams\n\nIn this section we review the Schwarzschild black hole as an example of a Weyl spacetime\nand then we explain the construction of its associated Weyl card diagram. General features\nand properties of card diagrams are also developed.\nUp to now if a solution such as the Schwarzschild black hole had horizons, then only the\nregions outside the horizons have been drawn in Weyl coordinates [22, 24]. To go through\na nonextremal horizon, the Weyl coordinate \u03c1 must be allowed to take imaginary values.\nWe discuss how the horizon can be represented as a junction of four regions which we call\nfour cards. The regions outside the horizon will be drawn as two horizontal cards while the\nregions between the horizon and the singularity will be drawn as two vertical cards. The\ninterior vertical cards naively are problematic and have fourfold-covered triangles bounded\nby 'special null lines'. However the triangles can be unfolded and glued together into a square\nalong the 'special null lines' to achieve a singly covered representation of the spacetime in\nWeyl coordinates by properly choosing branches of a square root in the solution.\nNote that card diagrams represent the spaces on which we solve the Laplace equation\n(horizontal card) or wave equation (vertical card) to find a Weyl metric. For example, the\nSchwarzschild black hole has a finite length uniform density rod source along the z-axis\ngenerating the potential log f , and the remainder of its z-axis encodes the vanishing of the\n\u03c6-circle. Thus card diagrams give a full account of the boundary conditions necessary to\nspecify the spacetime.\n\n2.1\n\nSchwarzschild black holes\n\nThis section will describe the construction of the Schwarzschild black hole card diagram.\nThe Penrose and card diagrams are compared in Fig. 1.\nThe Schwarzschild metric in spherically symmetric (Schwarzschild) coordinates is\nds2 = \u2212(1 \u2212 2M/r)dt2 + (1 \u2212 2M/r)\u22121dr 2 + r 2 d\u03b82 + r 2 sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 .\n\n(1)\n\nThere is a horizon at r = 2M and a curvature singularity at r = 0. On the other hand, in\nWeyl's canonical coordinates the metric ansatz is [22, 23, 24] it is\nds2 = \u2212f dt2 + f \u22121 (e2\u03b3 (d\u03c12 + dz 2 ) + \u03c12 d\u03c62 )\n\n4\n\n(2)\n\n\fsingularity\nhorizon\nsingularity\n\nhorizon\n\nV1\n\nH2\n\n\u03c1'\n\nV1\n\nz\n\nH1\n\nH2\n\n\u03c1\n\n-M\n\nM\n\nV2\n\u03c1\nsingularity\n\nz\n\nH1\nV2\n\nsingularity\n\nFigure 1: The Schwarzschild black hole represented both as a Penrose diagram as on the left\nand as a Weyl card diagram on the right. The cards V1 and V2 are vertical squares made\nof four triangles, while the cards H1 and H2 are horizontal and are infinite half-planes. The\nfour cards join together along the black hole horizon on the z-axis.\n\nwhere f and \u03b3 are functions of the coordinates \u03c1 and z:\n(R+ + R\u2212 )2 \u2212 4M 2\n,\n(R+ + R\u2212 + 2M)2\n(R+ + R\u2212 )2 \u2212 4M 2\n,\n=\n4R+ R\u2212\np\n=\n\u03c12 + (z \u00b1 M)2 .\n\nf =\ne2\u03b3\nR\u00b1\n\n(3)\n\nPreviously attention was restricted to the H1 half-plane \u03c1 \u2265 0, \u2212\u221e < z < \u221e, known as\nWeyl space, which describes the exterior of the black hole and whose horizon is represented\nby a 'rod' line segment \u03c1 = 0, \u2212M \u2264 z \u2264 M; see Fig. 2. Note that the non-Killing 2-metric\nis conformal to the Euclidean flat space d\u03c12 + dz 2 . The coordinate transformation between\nSchwarzschild and Weyl coordinates is\n\u03c1 =\n\n\u221a\n\nr 2 \u2212 2Mr sin \u03b8,\n\n(4)\n\nz = (r \u2212 M) cos \u03b8.\n\nNow we wish to ask how Weyl's coordinates draw the spacetime inside the horizon. The\nSchwarzschild coordinates (4) tell us that for 0 < r < 2M, \u03c1 is imaginary and so we set\n\u03c1\u2032 = i\u03c1. (In general we must perform an analytic continuation of Weyl coordinates to\ngo through a horizon which are at the zeros of the Weyl functions f, e2\u03b3 .) The analytic\ncontinuation gives a region with a conformally Minkowskian metric \u2212d\u03c1\u20322 + dz 2 and we will\n5\n\n\fdraw this region as being vertical and perpendicularly attached to the horizontal card at the\nhorizon \u2212M \u2264 z \u2264 M. The vertical direction is always timelike in card diagrams.\n\u03c1'\n\nhorizon\n\nboundary\n\nboundary\n\u2212M\n\nM\nz\n\n\u03c1\n\n\u03b8 const\n\nr const\n\nFigure 2: In Weyl coordinates the Schwarzschild black hole is typically represented as a\n\u03c1, z horizontal half-plane showing one external universe, H1, of r \u2265 2M. The horizon is\nrepresented as a rod along \u03c1 = 0, \u2212M \u2264 z \u2264 M. The 0 < r < 2M region will be drawn\nalong the vertical perpendicular \u03c1\u2032 -direction.\nOf course the Schwarzschild horizon structure is more complicated than just having two\ncards joined together. For example we know the Penrose diagram in the t, r coordinates\nis divided into four regions that meet in a \u00d7-horizon structure. In Weyl coordinates, we\nalready saw that we can extend \u03c1 \u2192 \u00b1i\u03c1\u2032 or go to negative \u03c1. This gives us the four regions\nof the Schwarzschild black hole in Weyl coordinates. Two regions will be horizontal at real\nvalues of \u03c1 and two regions will be vertical with imaginary values of \u03c1. So in addition to the\nfirst horizontal card in front of the horizon, we also have a copy of the horizontal external\nuniverse behind the horizon and attach two vertical cards, one above and one mirror copy\nbelow the horizontal cards (see Fig. 1). All together, four different regions attach together\nat the same \u2212M \u2264 z \u2264 M rod horizon.\nThe four regions labelled H1, H2, V1 and V2 in the Penrose diagram map to the similarly\nlabelled four regions on the card diagram in Fig. 1. Note that the Weyl cards draw the r, \u03b8\ncoordinates which is different from the t, r coordinates of the Penrose diagram. However the\nfact that the radial coordinate r describes four distinct regions, two where \u2202r is spacelike\nand two where it is timelike, is still apparent in the Weyl card diagram. So while a Penrose\ndiagram always has a Lorentzian \u2212+ signature, a card diagram will flip from being Euclidean\n++ to Lorentzian \u2212+ across a nonextremal Killing horizon.\nLet us now examine the construction of the upper vertical card extended in the \u03c1\u2032 , z\ndirections. Looking at an r-orbit for r \u2208 [0, 2M] on the vertical card, we see that in Weyl\np\ncoordinates 0 \u2264 \u03c1\u2032 \u2264 M \u00b1 z. The bounding lines where R\u00b1 = \u2212\u03c1\u20322 + (z \u00b1 M)2 = 0, we\nwill call 'special null lines,' and they are a general feature of vertical cards with focal points\n(the rod endpoints z = \u00b1M). Here, special null lines are the envelope of the r-orbits as\n6\n\n\f\u03c1'\nM\nspecial null line\n\nspecial null line\n\nboundary\n\nboundary\n\u2212 M\n\nhorizon\n\nM\n\nz\n\nFigure 3: The Weyl representation of the interior of the Schwarzschild black hole naively\ngives a triangle with base length 2M and height M. As we illustrate, the triangle interior is\ncovered four times by orbits of r at four different values of \u03b8.\n\nspecial null line\nhorizon r=2M\n\nr=M\n\nspecial null line\n\nFigure 4: The Weyl null lines for the Schwarzschild black hole correspond to two 3-surfaces\nwhich partition 0 < r < 2M into four subregions.\n\nwe vary \u03b8. Inside the horizon the Schwarzschild coordinates apparently fill out a 45-45-90\ndegree Weyl triangle with hypotenuse length 2M a total of four times, as shown in Figure 3.\nSpecial null lines play an important role in Weyl card diagrams so let us explain their\nsignificance. Keep in mind that we have already broken the manifest spherical symmetry\nwhen we have written the Schwarzschild metric in Weyl coordinates, so the existence of\npreferred special null lines is relative to this chosen axis. Consider the two 3-surfaces\nR\u00b1 = r \u2212 M \u00b1 M cos \u03b8 = 0,\n\n(5)\n\nwhich are drawn in Fig. 4. These surfaces bound the trajectories of light rays that do not\nmove in the Killing directions. The surfaces intersect at r = M and partition the black hole\ninterior into four subregions. These regions correspond to the four Weyl triangles.\nIt is clear from (5) that R\u00b1 is positive outside the horizon and there is no difficulty going\n7\n\n\fto negative values inside the horizon. On the other hand in terms of Weyl coordinates, the\np\nfunctions R\u00b1 = \u2212\u03c1\u20322 + (z \u00b1 M)2 are the square root of a positive number when \u03c1\u2032 < z \u00b1M\nand imaginary if \u03c1\u2032 > z \u00b1 M. Clearly, instead of dealing with imaginary values of R\u00b1 , the\nway to go 'beyond' the special null line R\u00b1 = 0 is to keep \u03c1\u2032 < z \u00b1 M but use the other\nsquare root branch for R\u00b1 as it enters in the Weyl functions f and \u03b3 by explicitly replacing\nR\u00b1 \u2192 \u2212R\u00b1 . Since we can pass R+ = 0 and/or pass R\u2212 = 0, it is clear that the four different\nbranches of the square root functions differentiate the four copies of the Weyl triangle.\nFrom (3), passing each R\u00b1 = 0 null line changes the sign of e2\u03b3 and hence exchanges\nthe timelike and spacelike nature of \u03c1\u2032 and z. Since the vertical direction on a vertical\ncard always represents time, two of the triangles are drawn turned on their sides, their\nhypotenuses vertical and so timelike. The four triangles describing the interior of the black\nhole 0 \u2264 r \u2264 2M glue together along the special null lines to fit neatly into a square; see\nFig. 5. Because of the unfolding of the triangles, the positive z-direction on the top triangle\n(and any attached horizontal cards) points in the opposite direction compared to that on\nthe original horizontal card.\nsingularity\n\n\u03c1'\n\nz\n2M\n\n\u03c1'\n\nz\n\n\u03c1'\n\u03c1'\n\nboundary\n\nz\nz\n\n2M\n\nz\n\nFigure 5: Unfolding the four triangles along the 45\u25e6 special null lines for 0 < r < 2M,\nproduces a square, V1, of side length 2M. The horizon is at the bottom and the singularity\nat the top. We also draw two lines of constant Schwarzschild coordinate \u03b8 and varying r.\n\nThe upper vertical cards is thus a square of length 2M. The bottom of the upper card\nV1 is the black hole horizon which connects to three other cards in a four card junction.\nThe right and left edges of this vertical card correspond to \u03b8 = 0, \u03c0 and are the boundaries\nwhere \u03c1\u2032 = 0 the \u03c6-circle vanishes. The top edge of the card represents the r = 0 curvature\nsingularity. The second vertical card V2 is built in analogous fashion except the square is\nbuilt in a downwards fashion towards negative values of \u03c1\u2032 . Additionally there is a second\nhorizontal card plane, H2, identical to H1 at negative values of the \u03c1 coordinate attached to\n8\n\n\fthe same horizon along [\u2212M, M] on the z-axis.\nOne typically stops the construction of the Schwarzschild spacetime with the above four\nregions, and considers the r < 0 part of the metric to be a separate spacetime. However for\nreasons which become clear when we look at the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f8m and Kerr black holes\nin Sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.4, we continue the card diagram past the singularity and attach\ntwo horizontal half-plane corresponding to negative-mass (or r < 0) universes h3 & h4, and\nfurther vertical card above the singularity which is identical to V2. The two new horizontal\ncards each represent negative mass-universes with no horizon and a naked singularity along\n\u2212M \u2264 z \u2264 M. Note that although Penrose diagrams for the r > 0 and r < 0 regions\nof Schwarzschild cannot attach together since the singularity is spacelike in one region and\ntimelike in another, cards can naturally attach at this singularity. The extended card diagram\nfor Schwarzschild, shown in Fig. 6, is an infinite array of repeated cards representing positive\n(H1,H2) and negative (h3,h4) mass universes and inside-horizon regions.\n\nV2\nV2\nh4\n\nh3\n\nh4\n\nh3\nV1\nV1\nH2\n\nH1\n\nH2\n\nH1\nV2\n\nV2\nh4\n\nh3\n\nh4\n\nh3\n\nFigure 6: The extended card diagram for Schwarzschild includes both positive (H1,H2) and\nnegative (h3,h4) mass universes half-planes. Its cross-section for z = 0 is drawn on the right.\n\n2.2\n\nGeneral properties of card diagrams\n\nHaving described the construction of the card diagram for Schwarzschild we now turn to\ngeneral remarks about these card diagrams. Card diagrams can be constructed in general\nD-dimensions starting from a generalized Weyl ansatz including the charged cases discussed\nin Appendix B. Horizontal cards are conformally Euclidean and represent stationary regions.\nVertical cards are always conformally Minkowskian and represent regions with (D \u22122) spacelike Killing fields. On a vertical card time is always in the vertical direction and a spacetime\npoint's causal future lies between 45\u25e6 null lines on the card. Weyl's coordinates certainly go\n9\n\n\fbad at horizons, so these diagrams are not a full replacement for Penrose diagrams at understanding causal structure or particle trajectories. However, it is clear for example from Fig. 1\nthat two vertical and two horizontal cards attach together in a orthogonal +-configuration\nin precisely the sense of the \u00d7-horizon structure of the Penrose diagram.\nThe prototypical horizon is that of the two Rindler and two Milne wedges of flat space;\nthis spacetime has two horizontal half-plane cards and two vertical half plane cards that\nmeet along the horizon being the whole z-axis. Zooming in on a non-extremal horizon of\nany card diagram yields this Rindler/Milne picture.\nA rod endpoint (\u03c1, z) = (0, zi ) such as z = \u00b1M for Schwarzschild is a 'focus' for the Weyl\ndiagram and often represents the edge of a black hole horizon or the end of an acceleration\nhorizon on a horizontal card. Generally, multi-black hole Weyl spacetimes depend only on\ndistances to foci, such as R\u00b1 in the case of Schwarzschild [43].\nTo understand that in general it is natural to change the branch of the distance functions,\nRi , when crossing the special null line that emanates from the foci at z = zi , take some Weyl\nspacetime and imagine moving upwards in a vertical card to meet the special null line where\np\nRi = 0 by increasing time \u03c1\u2032 \u2265 0 for fixed spatial z. Rearranging Ri = \u2212\u03c1\u20322 + (z + zi )2 as\nthe semi-ellipse\nRi2 + \u03c1\u20322 = (z + zi )2 ,\nwe see that a smooth traversal of this semi-ellipse across Ri = 0 requires a change in the\nsign of Ri .\nIn many of our solutions, special null lines are used to reflect vertical triangular cards\nto create full, rectangular cards. However, in the Bonnor-transformed S-dihole geometry of\n[20] as well as double Killing rotated extremal geometries and parabolic representations of\nthe bubble and S-Schwarzschild in Sec. 3.2.3, the special null lines will serve as conformal\nboundaries at null infinity I \u00b1 .\nBoundaries of cards indicate where the metric coefficient along a Killing (circle) direction\nvanishes. Which circle vanishes is constant over a connected piece of the boundary, even\nwhen the boundary turns a right angle onto a vertical card. Furthermore the periodicity\nto eliminate conical singularities is constant along connected parts of the boundary. For\nSchwarzschild, the \u03c6-circle vanishes on both connected boundaries and has periodicity 2\u03c0.\nAlthough not a full replacement for understanding causal structure, it is interesting to\nconsider geodesic trajectories on card diagrams. For example when a light ray is incident\nfrom a horizontal card onto a horizon (to enter the upper vertical card), it must turn and\nmeet that horizon perpendicularly. It then appears on the vertical card, again perpendicular\nto the horizon. Only those light rays which go from the lower vertical card to the upper\n10\n\n\fvertical card directly can meet the horizon rod at a non-right angle; these rays would touch\nthe vertex of the \u00d7 in a Schwarzschild Penrose diagram. When a light ray on a vertical\ncard hits a boundary where a spacelike circle vanishes, it bounces back at the same angle as\ndrawn on the card relative to the perpendicular.\nSpacetimes with a symmetry group larger than the minimal Weyl symmetry can have\nmore than one card diagram representation. Multiple diagrams exist when there is more\nthan one equivalent way to choose (D \u2212 2) Killing congruences on the spacetime manifold.\nExamples we explicitly discuss in Sec. 3.2 are the 4d Witten bubble and the 4d S-ReissnerNordstr\u00f8m (S-RN) which have three card diagrams corresponding to the three types of\nKilling congruences on dS2 and H2 . These different card diagrams are associated for example\nwith global, patched, and Poincar\u00e9 coordinates for dS2 and the different representations will\nhave different applications and reveal different information. On the other hand the S-Kerr\nsolution, whose card diagram is discussed in Sec. 3.1.4, has symmetry group U(1) \u00d7 R and\nits unique card representation looks like the 'elliptic' representation of S-RN.\n2.2.1\n\nOur deck of cards: The building blocks for Weyl spacetimes\n\nAll spacetimes, new and old, in this paper are built from the following card types.\nHorizontal cards are always half-planes. They may however have one or more branch\ncuts which may be taken to run perpendicular to the z-axis. Undoing one branch cut leads\nto a horizontal strip with two boundaries; multiple branch cuts lead to some open subset,\nwith boundary, of a Riemann surface.\nVertical cards may be noncompact: Full planes with or without a pair of special null\nlines; half-planes with vertical or horizontal (horizon) boundary; or quarter planes at any\n45\u25e6 orientation. Vertical cards may also be compact: Squares with a pair of special null lines;\nor 45-45-90 triangles at any 45\u25e6 orientation. All horizontal and vertical boundaries represent\nwhere a Killing circle vanishes and hence the end of the card. All 45\u25e6 null boundaries\nrepresent instances of I \u00b1 .\nIt is satisfying that for a variety of spacetimes including those in [42, 6], the cards are\nalways of the above rigid types.\nThere is one basic procedure which can be performed on vertical cards and their corresponding Weyl solutions. It is the analytic continuation 2\u03b3 \u2192 2\u03b3 + i\u03c0, which is allowed since\n\u03b3 is determined by first order PDEs and e2\u03b3 is real of either sign on vertical cards. This\ncontinuation is equivalent to multiplying the metric by a minus sign and then analytically\ncontinuing the D \u2212 2 Killing directions. For charged generalizations of Weyl solutions (see\n11\n\n\fAppendix B), this procedure does not affect the reality of the 1-form gauge field. We call\nthis analytic continuation a \u03b3-flip since the way it acts on a card is to geometrically flip it\nabout a 45\u25e6 null line (for example, look at the vertical cards in Figs. 18 and 19).\n\n3\n\nCard diagrams\n\nIn this section we construct the card diagrams for a wide assortment of solutions including\nblack holes, bubbles and S-branes. The card diagrams are shown to be useful in representing\ncontinuous changes in the global spacetime structure such as how Reissner-Nordstr\u00f8m black\nholes change as we take their chargeless and extremal limits. For the superextremal black\nholes we discuss how to deal with branch points and cuts on horizontal cards. The card\ndiagram also clearly represents the Kerr ring singularity and how traversing the interior of\nthe ring leads to a second asymptotic spacetime. The 5d black ring solution, associated\nC-metric type solutions and twisted S-branes are also discussed.\nFurthermore analytic continuation has an interesting interpretation in terms of card diagrams. We will describe the effect of analytic continuation on the card diagrams by examining\ntwo known analytic continuations of the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f8m black hole, the charged bubble and the S0-brane which we also call S-RN. These time dependent spacetimes each have\nthree card diagram representation and two are obtained via different analytic continuations\nin Weyl coordinates. The Witten bubble and S-RN are related to each other by what we\ncall a \u03b3-flip which is a geometric realization of analytic continuation.\n\n3.1\n3.1.1\n\nBlack holes\nSubextremal Q2 < M 2 Reissner-Nordstr\u00f8m black holes\n\nIn the usual coordinates the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f8m black hole takes the form\n\u0010\n\u0010\n2M\nQ2 \u0011\nQ2 \u0011\u22121 2\n2M\n+ 2 dt2 + 1 \u2212\n+ 2\ndr + r 2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 )\nds2 = \u2212 1 \u2212\nr\nr\nr\nr\nA = Qdt/r\n\n(6)\n\nUsing the coordinate transformation\n\u03c1=\n\np\n\nr 2 \u2212 2Mr + Q2 sin \u03b8,\n\n12\n\nz = (r \u2212 M) cos \u03b8\n\n(7)\n\n\fwe find the Weyl form of Reissner-Nordstr\u00f8m black hole\nds2 = \u2212f dt2 + f \u22121 (e2\u03b3 (d\u03c12 + dz 2 ) + \u03c12 d\u03c62 )\n(R+ + R\u2212 )2 \u2212 4(M 2 \u2212 Q2 )\nf =\n(R+ + R\u2212 + 2M)2\n(R+ + R\u2212 )2 \u2212 4(M 2 \u2212 Q2 )\n2\u03b3\ne\n=\n4R+ R\u2212\n2Qdt\nA = \u2212\nR + R\u2212 + 2M\nq +\np\np\nR\u00b1 =\n\u03c12 + (z \u00b1 M 2 \u2212 Q2 )2 = r \u2212 M \u00b1 M 2 \u2212 Q2 cos \u03b8\n\n(8)\n\nand the card diagram for Q2 < M 2 is shown in Fig. 7. The construction of the card diagram\nproceeds along similar lines to the Schwarzschild card diagram. There are two adjacent\nhorizontal half-planes, H1 and H2, which represent the positive mass asymptotically flat\np\nregions. The outer horizon at r+ = M + M 2 + Q2 is represented in Weyl space as a rod\np\np\nwhich lies along the z-axis for \u2212 M 2 \u2212 Q2 < z < M 2 \u2212 Q2 . The vertical cards, V1 and\np\nV2, are squares of length 2 M 2 \u2212 Q2 and the diagonal lines connecting opposite corners of\np\nthe square are special null lines. The top of V2 is the r\u2212 = M \u2212 M 2 \u2212 Q2 rod which is a\nfour-card inner horizon. The black hole singularity no longer is on the edge of V2 but instead\nis on the outer boundary of the horizontal h1 and h2 regions, at \u03c12 /Q2 + z 2 /M 2 = 1. Now\nthe singularity is timelike and avoidable from the view of an observer on a vertical card. The\nrest of those horizontal cards, regions h3 and h4, are r < 0 or equivalently M < 0 nakedly\nsingular RN spacetimes.\nAt each horizon, the card diagram is continued vertically to obtain an infinite tower of\ncards. In Fig. 8 we show the Penrose diagram for comparison.\nAlthough the chargeless Q \u2192 0 limit is hard to understand from Penrose diagrams, it is\neasy to understand using the card diagram in Fig. 7; the vertical card expands to a 2M \u00d72M\nsquare and the singularity degenerates to a line segment coinciding with the inner horizon.\nRegions h1 and h2 disappear so the singularity is now 'visible' from V1 and V2 as well as\nh3 and h4; the singularity is spacelike relative to vertical cards and timelike for horizontal\ncard observers. This achieves the Schwarzschild infinite array of cards in Fig. 6.\n3.1.2\n\nExtremal Q2 = M 2 Reissner-Nordstr\u00f8m black hole\n\nStarting from the above card diagram we now examine the extremal limit Q \u2192 \u00b1M. In this\ncase the vertical cards which represent the regions between the two horizons get smaller and\ndisappear. When Q = M, the horizontal cards are now only attached at point-like extremalhorizons and only half of the horizontal cards remain connected, see Fig. 9.

The throat is a 'connected' sequence of points on vertically adjacent\nhorizontal cards.\nTo understand how to go across the horizon, it is important to remember that there\nare special null lines in r\u2212 < r < r+ . In the extremal case the focal distances are equal\n(R = R+ = R\u2212 ) and the null lines R\u00b1 = 0 degenerate to the origin. So when we pass\nthrough the throat to an adjacent r < M horizontal card, the sign changes for all occurrences\np\nof R = \u03c12 + z 2 = r \u2212 M. Half the cards are now absent relative to the subextremal case\nsince we no longer perform analytic continuation to get the vertical card. We can only go\nfrom positive real values of \u03c1 to negative values of \u03c1 alternatively. The singularity appears\nas a semicircle on the r < M cards.\nFor axisymmetric Majumdar-Papapetrou solutions, this 'sign change rule' agrees with\nthat in [21]. Our analysis also applies to non-MP axisymmetric solutions such as the dihole\n[44, 45, 46].\n\n14\n\n\fz\n\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\n\u03c1\n\n\u03c1\n\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\nFigure 9: The extremal RN card diagram.

One card has a semi-ellipse singularity passing through the\npoints (\u03c1 = 0, z = \u00b1M) and (\u03c1 = Q, z = 0) (see Fig. 10(a)).\nThese two horizontal cards are connected in the same sense as a branched Riemann sheet.\nBy choosing Weyl's canonical coordinates (meaning Z = \u03c1+iz with \u2212(Coef dt2 )(Coef d\u03c62 ) =\n(Re Z)2 ), the solution is no longer accurately represented on the horizontal card. This can be\nseen by examining the coordinate transformation (8) from Schwarzschild coordinates to Weyl\ncoordinates. For fixed r and varying \u03b8, the coordinates from M < r < \u221e cover the Weyl\np\nplane in semi-ellipses which degenerate to the segment (0 \u2264 \u03c1 \u2264 Q2 \u2212 M 2 , z = 0), which\np\nserves as a branch cut; and \u03c1 = Q2 \u2212 M 2 is the branch point. The range \u2212\u221e < r < M\nagain covers the half-plane with r = 0 forming an\nCrossing the branch\nqellipse singularity.\np\ncut means choosing the opposite signs for R\u00b1 = \u03c12 \u2212 (z \u00b1 i Q2 \u2212 M 2 )2 , and indeed we\ncan think of the superextremal 'rod' as being complex-perpendicular to the Weyl Z-plane.\nThis double cover of the Weyl plane can be fixed by taking a holomorphic square root;\nthis preserves theqconformally Euclidean character of the card diagram. By choosing a new\np\ncoordinate W = Z \u2212 Q2 \u2212 M 2 , we map both the positive and negative-mass universes\np\ninto the region (Im W )2 \u2212 (Re W )2 \u2264 Q2 \u2212 M 2 (see Fig. 10(b)). The image of the z-axis\nboundary is a hyperbola where the \u03c6-circle vanishes. The origin W = 0 is the image of\np\nthe branch point and the image of the line segment (0 \u2264 \u03c1 \u2264 Q2 + M 2 , z = 0) is a line\nconnecting the two hyperbolas and intersecting the origin of the W -plane.

This is useful when the horizontal card boundaries are horizons\nas it allows for multiple horizontal cards to be placed adjacent to each other at the horizons\n(Fig. 17). This technique of fixing a horizontal card with a branch point will also be used in\nmore complicated geometries such as the hyperbolic representation of S-RN and multi-rod\nsolutions in four and five dimensions [20].\n3.1.4\n\nKerr black hole\n\nWritten in Weyl-Papapetrou form, the Kerr black hole is\nds2 = \u2212f (dt \u2212 \u03c9d\u03c6)2 + f \u22121 (e2\u03b3 (d\u03c12 + dz 2 ) + \u03c12 d\u03c62 ),\nf =\ne2\u03b3 =\n\u03c9 =\n\n(9)\n\na2\n\n(R+ \u2212 R\u2212 )2\nM 2 \u2212a2\n,\n2\n(R+ + R\u2212 + 2M)2 + M 2a\u2212a2 (R+ \u2212 R\u2212 )2\n2\n(R+ + R\u2212 )2 \u2212 4M 2 + M 2a\u2212a2 (R+ \u2212 R\u2212 )2\n(R+ + R\u2212 )2 \u2212 4M 2 +\n\n4R+ R\u2212\n\n2aM(M +\n1\n(R+\n4\n\nR+ +R\u2212\n)(1\n2\n\n,\n\n(R+ \u2212R\u2212 )2\n)\n4(M 2 \u2212a2 )\n,\n2\n+ \u2212R\u2212 )\na2 (R\n)\n4(M 2 \u2212a2 )\n\n\u2212\n\n+ R\u2212 )2 \u2212 M 2 +\n\nq\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwhere R\u00b1 = \u03c12 + (z \u00b1 M 2 \u2212 a2 )2 = r \u2212 M \u00b1 M 2 \u2212 a2 cos \u03b8. The transformation to\n\u221a\nBoyer-Lindquist coordinates is \u03c1 = r 2 \u2212 2Mr + a2 sin \u03b8, z = (r \u2212 M) cos \u03b8.\n16\n\n\fFor a2 < M 2 the Kerr black hole card diagram (see Figure 11) is similar to ReissnerNordstr\u00f8m except that the singularity is now a point and lies at \u03c1 = a, z = 0 on each\nhorizontal negative-mass card. The outer and inner ergospheres lie on the positive-and\nnegative-mass cards and are both described by the curve z 2 = \u03b12 \u2212 (\u03b12 /a2 \u2212 1)\u03c12 \u2212 \u03c14 /a2\n\u221a\nwhich intersects the rod endpoints at z = \u00b1\u03b1 = \u00b1 M 2 \u2212 a2 . The boundary of the region\nwith closed timelike curves is also described by a quartic polynomial in Weyl coordinates.\nOnce again the vertical cards have two special null lines where R\u00b1 change sign.\nThe r = 0 surface in BL coordinates is a semi-ellipse \u03c12 /a2 + z 2 /M 2 = 1 on the negativemass card; but it is not a distinguished locus on the card diagram. Attempting to make one\nloop around the ring in the Kerr-Schild picture clearly does not make a closed loop in Weyl\nspace, whereas two loops in the Kerr-Schild picture will form a single loop around the ring\nsingularity on the card diagram. It is also clear that it is possible to find classical trajectories\nwhich avoid the singularity and which safely escape into a second asymptotically flat region.\nA card diagram for a charged Kerr-Newman solution can similarly be constructed, with\np\n\u03b1 = M 2 \u2212 Q2 \u2212 a2 .\n\nThe extremal Kerr(-Newman) solution has a card diagram like Fig. 9, but the ring singularity is just a point at z = 0 and \u03c1 = M on negative-mass cards. Again, R = R+ = R\u2212\nand the special null lines degenerate to the origin; crossing the origin (which is a twisted\nAdS-type throat) entails changing the sign of R.\nThe superextremal Kerr(-Newman) solution is similar to the superextremal RN (Fig. 10(b))\nexcept that the curved-segment singularity is replaced by a point (z = 0), and the ergospheres\nmap to an \u221e-looking locus centered at W = 0.\n3.1.5\n\nThe black ring\n\nThe 5d static black ring solution of [22] is\nF (x) 2\ndt\n(10)\nF (y)\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0010 dx2\n\u0010\n1\nF (y) 2\u0011\n1 \u2212 x2 2 \u0011\n2\n2\n2\nF (x) (y \u2212 1)d\u03c8 + 2\ndy + F (y)\n+\nd\u03c6\nA2 (x \u2212 y)2\ny \u22121\n1 \u2212 x2\nF (x)\n\nds2 = \u2212\n+\n\nwhere F (x) = 1 \u2212 \u03bcx, F (y) = 1 \u2212 \u03bcy, and 0 \u2264 \u03bc \u2264 1.

The black ring horizon is also on\nthe z-axis along \u2212\u03bc/2A \u2264 z \u2264 \u03bc/2A. The \u03c6-circle vanishes along z \u2264 \u2212\u03bc/2A and \u03bc/2A \u2264\nz \u2264 1/2A, and the \u03c8-circle vanishes along z \u2265 1/2A. Curves of constant y degenerate to\nthe horizon line segment as y \u2192 \u2212\u221e, and degenerate to the (1/2A, \u221e) ray (better pictured\nwith a conformally equivalent disk) for y \u2192 \u22121. Curves of constant x degenerate to the\nvanishing \u03c6-circle line segment for x \u2192 1 and to the ray (\u2212\u221e, \u2212\u03bc/2A) for x \u2192 \u22121.\nThe card diagram is easy to construct and is not much different from the four dimensional\nSchwarzschild case. Past y = \u2212\u221e we can go to y = +\u221e and hence imaginary \u03c1 = i\u03c1\u2032 , and\nmove up a \u03bc/A\u00d7\u03bc/A square with two special null lines. At the top of the square, at y = 1/\u03bc\nwe have the curvature singularity. Continuing again to real \u03c1 and running y down to 1, we\nmap out a (negative-mass) horizontal card. The locus y = 1 is the ray z \u2265 1/2A. The space\ncloses off here as the \u03c8-circle vanishes, but we formally continue to illustrate how C-metric\ncoordinates run on noncompact vertical cards-this is useful in several applications, such\nas the Pleba\u0144ski-Demia\u0144ski solution [49]. Past y = 1, we see that for fixed x, reducing y\ndown to x makes a topological half-line in a vertical card with a special null line. Then\nfor \u22121 < y < x, we traverse another vertical card, which we could attach to our original\npositive-mass horizontal card along z > 1/2A (see Fig. 12).\n18\n\n\fy=x\n\ny = 1/\u03bc\n\nz\n\nx= 1\n\nx =\u2212 1\n\ny=1\n\n\u03c8\n\u03c6\n\n\u03c1\n\ny =\u2212 \u221e\n\n\u03c1\n\n\u03c6\n\ny =\u2212 1\n\nz\n\ny=x\n\nFigure 12: An extended card diagram for the black ring, where we have continued past\ny = constant boundaries for \u22121 \u2264 x \u2264 1. A y-orbit is drawn curving through several cards.\nOnly one of the mirror pairs of vertical and horizontal cards are drawn at each four card\njunction to avoid too many overlapping figures.\n\nNote that when passing through the black ring horizon at y = \u2212\u221e, the Weyl conformal\nfactor [22]\ns\nr\nY\nR2 \u2212 \u03b62\nY\n1\n+\n\u03bc\n12\n23\n,\ne2\u03bd =\n4A R1 R2 R3 Y13 R3 \u2212 \u03b63\nstays real; R3 \u2212\u03b63 and Y13 go negative. As we pass the special null lines, explicit appearances\nof R1 and R2 in the Weyl functions e2Ui , e2\u03bd change sign.\nThe charged ring of [29] is generated by a functional transformation and hence inherits\na card diagram structure. In fact, any geometry with D \u2212 2 Killing directions written in\nC-metric coordinates has a card diagram.\n\n3.2\n\nCharged Witten bubbles and S-branes\n\nThe Schwarzschild black hole can be analytically continued to two different time-dependent\ngeometries, the Witten bubble of nothing [1] with a dS2 element and S-Schwarzschild [9, 10,\n11] with an H2 element, and it is instructive to understand how the card diagram changes.\nUnlike black hole geometries with their unique card diagrams, these time dependent geometries can have multiple card diagram representations. Both the bubble and S-Schwarzschild\nhave three different card diagram representations corresponding to three different ways to\n\n19\n\n\fselect Killing congruences. These three types of Killing congruences can be understood by\nrepresenting H2 as the unit disk (with its conformal infinity being the unit circle). The\norientation-preserving isometries of H2 are those M\u00f6bius transformations preserving the\naz+b\nhave two complex fixed points,\ndisk, P SL(2, R) [50]. M\u00f6bius transformations z 7\u2192 cz+d\ncounted according to multiplicity. In the upper half-plane z = x + i\u03c3 representation, a, b,\nc, and d are real, so the fixed points are roots of a real quadratic. Hence they may be (i)\ndistinct on the real boundary (hyperbolic), (ii) degenerate on the real boundary (parabolic),\nor (iii) nonreal complex conjugate pairs, one interior to the upper half-plane H2 (elliptic).\nPrototypes of Killing fields are (i) z \u2192 (1 + \u01eb)z for the upper half-plane, (ii) z \u2192 z + \u01eb for\nthe upper half-plane; and (iii) z \u2192 ei\u01eb z for the disk |z| < 1. These are the striped, Poincar\u00e9,\nand azimuthal congruences. In these hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptic representations, the\nS-Reissner-Nordstr\u00f8m (S-RN) and the Witten bubble each have 0, 1, and 2 Weyl foci.\n3.2.1\n\nElliptic representations and extended card diagrams\n\nThe bubble of nothing in D dimensions has the interpretation as a semi-classical decay mode\nof the Kaluza-Klein vacuum. A spatial slice is topologically S D\u22123 \u00d7 R2 , where the R2 is a\ncigar with the asymptotic-KK S 1 closing at some fixed r, which is an S D\u22123 bubble. As time\npasses, the bubble increases in size and 'destroys' the spacetime. The solution is obtained as\nan analytic continuation of a black hole and can be generalized to incorporate gauge fields.\nThe electrically charged bubble of nothing in its elliptic representation is gotten from (6)\nby sending t \u2192 ix4 , \u03c6 \u2192 i\u03c6, and to keep the field strength real we need Q \u2192 \u2212iQ.

These six patches will precisely correspond to\nthe six cards of Fig. 13.\nLet us now turn to the effect of the analytic continuation of the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f8m\nblack hole in Weyl coordinates. In Weyl coordinates, the effect of wick rotating t \u2192 ix4\nturns the horizon of the Schwarzschild card into an x4 -boundary, while \u03c6 \u2192 i\u03c6 turns the\nboundaries on the horizontal card into noncompact acceleration horizons along the rays\n|z| \u2265 M, \u03c1 = 0. At the two horizons sending \u03b8 \u2192 0 \u00b1 i\u03b8, \u03c0 \u00b1 i\u03b8 corresponds to \u03c1 \u2192 \u00b1i\u03c1\u2032\np\nalong the |z| \u2265 M 2 + Q2 rays. We find vertical noncompact one eighth-plane cards with\nspecial null lines along \u03c1\u2032 = z \u2212 M for z \u2265 M and \u03c1\u2032 = \u2212M \u2212 z for z \u2264 \u2212M.

Here, \u03b1 = M 2 + Q2 .\nR\u00b1 at the null line, as they appear in (8) to transform the card into a single covered quarter\nplane card.\nThe elliptic (and as we will shortly see the hyperbolic) representations of the Witten\nbubble are simply obtained because their dS2 Killing congruences are trivially obtained\nfrom those on S 2 . Specifically, take the S 2 embedding into flat space with Z = cos \u03b8,\nX = sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6, Y = sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6. Sending \u03c6 \u2192 i\u03c6 has the effect Y \u2192 iY \u2032 so the surface\nbecomes X 2 \u2212 Y \u20322 + Z 2 = 1 embedded in Minkowski space, or dS2 with \u03c6 as an elliptic\n(azimuthal) congruence. On the other hand sending \u03b8 \u2192 \u03c0/2 + i\u03b8, has the effect Z \u2192 iZ \u2032\ngiving X 2 +Y 2 \u2212Z \u20322 = 1, which is dS2 again but with \u03c6 as a hyperbolic (striped) congruence.\nNext the S-brane solution of [9, 10, 11]\nQ2\n2M\nQ2\n2M\n\u2212 2 )(dx4 )2 \u2212 (1 +\n\u2212 2 )\u22121 dt2 + t2 (d\u03b82 + sinh2 \u03b8d\u03c62 )\n(12)\nt\nt\nt\nt\ncan also be gotten from (6) by taking t \u2192 ix4 , \u03b8 \u2192 i\u03b8, r \u2192 it, and M \u2192 iM. From (7)\nwe see that in Weyl's coordinates this analytic continuation of RN can be implemented by\nsending t \u2192 ix4 , z \u2192 i\u03c4 , M \u2192 iM, up to a real coordinate transformation.\nds2 = (1 +\n\nThe card diagram for elliptic S-RN (Fig. 14) has the same structure as the Witten bubble\n(Fig. 13) except that the 6-segment boundary is now \u03b8 = 0 where the \u03c6-circle vanishes. The\np\nright and left horizons are at t = t\u00b1 = M \u00b1 M 2 + Q2 .

The two t > 2M vertical cards and two 0 < t < 2M horizontal cards\nthen form a positive-mass S-Schwarzschild, while each t < 2M card forms a negative-mass\nS-Schwarzschild whose singularities begin or end the spacetime.\nOne can alternatively form the elliptic S-Schwarzschild from the elliptic Witten bubble by\nperforming the \u03b3-flip on any vertical card. This procedure is immediate; the net continuation\nfrom Schwarzschild is \u03b8 \u2192 i\u03b8, g\u03bc\u03bd \u2192 \u2212g\u03bc\u03bd , and avoids r \u2192 it, z \u2192 i\u03c4 , and M \u2192 iM.\nNote how the card representation of the S-brane is quite different from the black hole\n22\n\n\fcard diagram while the Penrose diagrams of the two spacetimes are nearly just related by\nninety degree rotation. This is because the card diagram shows the compact or noncompact\n\u03b8 direction.\nThe elliptic form of the card diagrams show that Schwarzschild S-brane, Witten bubble\nand Schwarzschild solutions have similar structures and in fact they are all related by \u03b3flips and trivial Killing continuations.2 Solutions which are related in this manner may be\nconveniently drawn together in one diagram which simultaneously displays all of their card\ndiagrams. For example in Fig. 16 the S-Schwarzschild solution comprises regions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,\nthe Witten bubble regions 4, 5, 6, and the Schwarzschild black hole 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Regions\n1, 2, 10 correspond to a singular Witten bubble of negative 'mass.' In this diagram we also\nsee that the unification of the special null lines as they extend through all three solutions;\nwe can say R+ = 0 is the long \u001e-null line and R\u2212 = 0 is the long \u001f-null line.\nThe charged Reissner-Nordstr\u00f8m BH/bubble/S-brane solutions cannot be depicted together on such a diagram because Q \u2192 iQ changes 0 < r\u2212 < r+ to r\u2212 < 0 < r+ .

To\nachieve this in Weyl's coordinates, we put z \u2192 i\u03c4 , t \u2192 ix4 , Q \u2192 \u2212iQ; the resulting space is\nequivalent to Witten's bubble by the real coordinate transformation\n\u03c1=\n\np\nr 2 \u2212 2Mr \u2212 Q2 cosh \u03b8,\n\n\u03c4 = (r \u2212 M) sinh \u03b8.\n\n(14)\n\nThus in Weyl coordinates the only difference between the hyperbolic Witten bubble and\nthe elliptic S-RN is putting M \u2192 iM. Witten's bubble universe is represented in Weyl\ncoordinates as a vertical half-plane card, \u03c1 \u2265 0, \u2212\u221e < \u03c4 < \u221e, where now the x4 -circle, and\nnot the \u03c6-circle, vanishes at \u03c1 = 0. This boundary is where the bubble of nothing begins.\nNote that the vertical card now has Minkowski signature and is conformal to \u2212d\u03c4 2 + d\u03c12 .\nThis vertical card does not have special null lines since the foci are at imaginary values\n\u03c4 = \u00b1iM, and so the spacetime is covered only once by the Schwarzschild coordinates. The\nbubble does have a rod which is along the imaginary \u03c4 axis and which intersects the card\nat the \u03c1 = 0, \u03c4 = 0 origin. The hyperbolic representation of the charged Witten bubble\nis therefore just a vertical half-plane. In such a case the card diagrams have just as much\ncausal information as a Penrose diagram and the boundary of the card easily describes the\nedge of the bubble of nothing.\nWe obtain a hyperbolic representation for S-RN from (6) by sending t \u2192 ix4 , M \u2192 iM,\nr \u2192 ir, \u03b8 \u2192 \u03c0/2 + i\u03b8, and \u03c6 \u2192 i\u03c6. The fibered directions are now hyperbolic dH22 =\nd\u03b82 + cosh2 \u03b8d\u03c62 . In Weyl coordinates, to maintain reality of the solution, we begin with\nRN (8) and send t \u2192 ix4 , \u03c6 \u2192 i\u03c6, M \u2192 iM, and must explicitly change the branch of\nthe square root introducing the minus sign R\u2212 \u2192 \u2212R\u2212 .3 This has the interpretation of\nstaying on the same horizontal card and rotating the rod in the complex z-plane. The foci\np\nare then at (z = \u00b1i M 2 + Q2 , \u03c1 = 0) with their special null lines intersecting the real\np\nhalf-plane at z = 0, \u03c1 = M 2 + Q2 . The half-plane is doubly covered, and we will take\np\n0 \u2264 \u03c1 \u2264 M 2 + Q2 as the branch cut. The sign change of R\u2212 has effectively reversed\nthe roles of r and \u03b8 so that, after undoing the branch cut with say a square-root conformal\ntransformation, r = r+ > 0 is one boundary-horizon and r = r\u2212 < 0 is the other. The\nhyperbolic angle \u03b8 is unbounded \u2212\u221e < \u03b8 < \u221e.\nThe doubly-covered half-plane is physically cut into two by the r = 0 singularity. At each\nhorizon r = r\u00b1 we have a four-card junction; the double half-plane horizontal card meets\nanother mirror copy as well as two vertical cards. The vertical cards are at \u03c1 \u2192 \u00b1i\u03c1\u2032 and\n\u2212\u221e < z < \u221e and have no special null lines or other features. A full card diagram is shown\n3\n\nThe naturalness of this sign change is explained in great detail in [20].\n\n24\n\n\fin Fig. 17.

Take the RN black hole and analytically\ncontinue to get the hyperbolic charged Witten bubbles. These universes are nonsingular for\nr \u2265 r+ or r \u2264 r\u2212 . They have boundaries at r = r\u00b1 where the x4 -circle vanishes. Now, turn\nthese universes on their sides with the \u03b3-flip. This allows us to decompactify x4 and r = r\u00b1\nare now Milne horizons-we are looking precisely at the vertical cards of Fig. 17, and they\nare connected in a card diagram by an r\u2212 \u2264 r \u2264 r+ card which is now accessible. We see\nthat generally, vertical half-plane cards parametrized in spherical prolate fashion with no\nspecial null lines, when turned on their sides, connect to branched horizontal cards.\n\n25\n\n\fThe Q \u2192 0 limit (hyperbolic S-Schwarzschild) of the card diagram is easy to picture:\nThe singularities of Fig. 17 collapse onto the r = r\u2212 horizon.\nOne may wonder what happens if we take z \u2192 i\u03c4 , on the horizontal card for hyperbolic\np\nS-RN, and achieves a vertical card sandwiched between special null lines at \u03c1 = M 2 + Q2 +\n|\u03c4 |. This must unfold to give a vertical plane with two intersecting special null lines. This\ncard diagram structure is discussed in [20, 42].\n3.2.3\n\nParabolic representations\n\nThere is a third way to put a Killing congruence on H2 or dS2 using parabolic or Poincar\u00e9\n2\n, and\ncoordinates. Parametrizing hyperbolic space (Euclideanized AdS2 ) as ds2 = \u03c3 2 dx2 + d\u03c3\n\u03c32\n4\nkeeping the Schwarzschild S-brane coordinate r and the usual x we get a Poincar\u00e9 Weyl\nrepresentation of S-RN spacetime [7, 9, 10]. It is\nds2 = f (dx4 )2 \u2212 f \u22121 (e2\u03b3 (\u2212d\u03c1\u20322 + dz 2 ) + \u03c1\u20322 dx2 ),\n\n(16)\n\nA = Qdx4 /r,\n\nf = (1 \u2212 2M/r \u2212 Q2 /r 2 ),\nr 2 \u2212 2Mr \u2212 Q2\n,\ne2\u03b3 =\n\u03c3 2 (M 2 + Q2 )\np\n\u03c1\u2032 = \u03c3 r 2 \u2212 2Mr \u2212 Q2 ,\nz = \u03c3(r \u2212 M).\n\nIn this Weyl representation, \u03c1\u2032 is timelike on r \u2265 r+ vertical cards which are noncompact\n45\u25e6 wedges, 0 \u2264 \u00b1\u03c1\u2032 < z. This connects along z > 0 to an r\u2212 \u2264 r \u2264 r+ horizontal card;\nr \u2264 r\u2212 vertical cards attaches to z < 0. So this is similar to the elliptic representation of\np\np\nS-RN, except the line segment \u2212 M 2 + Q2 < z < M 2 + Q2 has collapsed and the special\nnull lines are now conformal null infinity (Fig. 18). The singularity on the horizontal card is\nparticularly easy to describe in these coordinates. On the first horizontal card it is on a ray\nz/\u03c1 = \u2212M/Q and on the second card it is on a ray z/\u03c1 = M/Q.\nIf we take the r \u2265 r+ (or r \u2264 r\u2212 ) 45\u25e6 wedges and turn them on their sides via the \u03b3-flip,\nwe get the parabolic version of the r \u2265 r+ (or r \u2264 r\u2212 ) charged Witten bubble. The line\nwhich used to be the horizon in the S-brane card diagram becomes a boundary which is\nthe 'minimum volume' sphere, at \u03c1 = 0. Time is now purely along the \u03c4 direction as in\nthe hyperbolic Witten bubble. The special null line is still I \u00b1 since \u03c1 = |\u03c4 | corresponds to\nr \u2192 \u221e. The vertex of the triangular card is not the end of the spacetime. These wedge\ncards only represent \u03c3 > 0 and so the card diagram should be extended to \u03c3 < 0. The card\ndiagram is an infinite array of 45\u25e6 wedge cards pointing up and an infinite number pointing\n26\n\n\fnull infinity I +\n\u03c1'\n\n\u03c1\n\nI+\n\n\u03c4\n\n\u03c4\n\n\u03c4\n\nboundary\n\n_\n\n\u03c1\n\n\u03c1\n\n\u03c1\n\nI\nsingularity\nz\nz\n\n\u03c1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\u03c1\n\n\u03c1\n\n\u03c1\n\nI\n\n+\n\nI-\n\nnull infinity I -\n\nFigure 19: The parabolic representation of the Witten bubble contains an\ninfinite number of 45\u25e6 wedge vertical\ncards pointing up and down with each\nwedge joined to two others at the tip in\na dS2 fashion.\n\nFigure 18: The parabolic card diagram representation for S-ReissnerNordstr\u00f8m. The 45\u25e6 vertical lines represent null infinity.\n\ndown. The vertex of each upward card is attached to its nearest two downward neighbors\n(one to the left and one to the right), in the dS2 fashion as shown in Figure 19. One can\nidentify cards so only needs one upward and one downward card with two attachments.\nAlthough this card diagram is not the most obvious representation of the Witten bubble,\nit is useful in understanding the S-Kerr solution of the next subsection as well as the more\ncomplicated S-dihole U, U\u00b1 universes of [20].\n\n3.3\n\nS-Kerr\n\nThe twisted S-brane [16], see also [17], is also known as S-Kerr, and it is another example\nof a nonsingular time-dependent solution. Twisted S-branes describe the decay of unstable\nmassive strings. They can be obtained from the Kerr black hole using the following card\ndiagram method. Double Killing continue t \u2192 ix4 , \u03c6 \u2192 i\u03c6 to achieve a K+ bubble solution,\ngo to the vertical card via \u03b8 \u2192 i\u03b8, then perform a \u03b3-flip to achieve S-Kerr. S-Kerr has\nsymmetry group U(1) \u00d7 R and therefore has a unique card diagram. For the parameter\nrange a2 < M 2 there are horizons and the card diagram structure is that of the elliptic\n\u221a\nbubble (Fig. 13). The foci are at z = \u00b1 M 2 \u2212 a2 . There is an ergosphere and CTC region\non the horizontal card and has the same qualitative shape as it does for the Kerr black\nhole diagram. In comparison, the Penrose diagram showing (variably twisted) x4 and the\nBoyer-Lindquist coordinate r is shown in Fig. 20.\n27\n\n\f\u2212\n\nV+\n\nV+\n\nV\u2212\nr\u2212\n\nH\n\nr+\n\nH\n\nH\nV+\n\nV\u2212\n\nV+\n\nV\u2212\n\nV\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\nFigure 20: Subextremal a2 < M 2 S-Kerr Penrose diagram.

The region below the\nnull line disappears in this limit and the horizontal card collapses to a point. Furthermore,\nthose geodesics in the upper-right card can only reach the lower-left card (and the same with\nupper-left and lower-right), splitting the universe into connected 45\u25e6 wedges just like the\nparabolic representation for the Witten bubble (Fig. 19), where the connections are dS2 -like\ntwisted throats.\nThe case a2 > M 2 for S-Kerr does not have horizons and can be represented as a single\nvertical half-plane card with \u03c1 \u2265 0 and with no special null lines. Just like the hyperbolic\nWitten bubble, superextremal S-Kerr can be turned on its side with the \u03b3-flip, to yield a\nnew spacetime [42]. In the limit where |a| \u2192 \u221e, the \u03b8-orbits flatten out on the card, and\nthe solution becomes flat space.\nThe Penrose diagrams for extremal and superextremal S-Kerr are given in Fig. 21.\n28\n\n\f4\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this paper we have examined and extended the utility of the Weyl Ansatz through the\nconstruction of an associated Weyl card diagram. Weyl coordinates are an excellent choice\nfor clearly understanding geometric features and so drawing the card diagram is useful.\nThe card diagram conveniently captures most of the interesting properties of a spacetime\nincluding its singularities, horizons, and some aspects of its causal structure and null infinity.\nCard diagrams for families of solutions such as charged and rotating black holes (and bubbles\nand S-branes) share similar features and can change continuously. They are useful in keeping\ntrack of various analytic continuations and mentally partitioning complicated spacetimes into\nsimpler regions. The only technical issues that seem to arise and which we resolved dealt\nwith branches of Weyl distance square-root functions, special null lines on vertical cards,\nand branched horizontal cards.\nHere we summarize the solutions in this paper. The card diagrams correctly capture the\ndifferent regions of the charged Reissner-Nordstr\u00f8m black hole and its various charged and\nchargeless limits, and its negative mass complement. We also analyzed the Kerr black hole\nand its singularity structure. In particular the safe passage through the interior of the ring\nto the second asymptotic universe through r = 0 is clearly depicted.\nThe Witten bubbles and S-branes each have three card diagrams representations corresponding to the three different choices of Killing congruences on dS2 or H2 . The elliptic\nrepresentations had two foci and six cards. S-RN had a cosmological singularity on the horizontal card splitting the card diagram into two connected universes, whereas the charged\nbubbles have the same card structure but are nonsingular. The hyperbolic representations\nhave no foci: the bubble is a simple vertical half-plane card and hyperbolic S-RN has a\nbranched horizontal card which we fixed by a conformal mapping of the half-plane. Finally\nthe parabolic representation of the bubble was an infinite array of 45\u25e6 triangle wedges connected pointwise while S-RN had a 6-card butterfly shape. This parabolic representation\nshowcased special null lines serving as null infinity.\nS-Reissner Nordstr\u00f8m can be obtained from the bubble in two ways. One may start\nwith the bubble and analytically continue M \u2192 iM in Weyl coordinates. In this case the\nhyperbolic/elliptic representation of the bubble maps to the elliptic/hyperbolic representation of the S-brane. We also found that these two solutions can be related by what we\ncalled the \u03b3-flip, which is conveniently visualized as a flip of the associated cards about a\nnull line. This procedure maintains the number of Weyl foci on the card and so maps the\nelliptic/parabolic/hyperbolic bubble to the elliptic/parabolic/hyperbolic S-brane. The \u03b3-flip\nprovides a simple and geometric way to relate Schwarzschild with its two analytic continu29\n\n\fations, the bubble of nothing and the S-brane. In fact spacetimes related by \u03b3-flips can be\nsimultaneously drawn together in a complexified r\u03b8 (or \u03c1, z) spacetime diagram.\nJust as we used the \u03b3-flip to turn the hyperbolic Witten bubble on its side and got\nhyperbolic S-RN, we can take the vertical half-plane card diagrams for the Kerr bubble,\ndihole wave, superextremal S-Kerr and superextremal S-dihole and apply the \u03b3-flip to yield\nnew spacetimes. These new solutions will be described in [42].\nThe card diagram formalism can be further generalized; the recently developed WeylPapapetrou formalism [27] for D \u2265 5 will yield card diagrams and 5d Kerr-related solutions\nwill appear in [42]. Furthermore card diagrams do not require Weyl's canonical coordinates.\nSpacetimes with Weyl-type symmetry and yet where Weyl's procedure fails algebraically can\nstill admit card diagrams. An example is the inclusion of a nonzero cosmological constant\n\u039b, where a \u03b3-flip changes the sign of \u039b. Card diagrams for pure (A)dSD space for D = 4, 5\nare presented in [6]. Constant-curvature black holes obtained by quotienting [51] will also\nhave card diagrams. We hope that our methods, and their further generalizations, will have\neven greater applicability than to the multitude of spacetimes already discussed herein.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank D.

We can use these solutions to smoothly perturb\nthe Witten bubble in two different ways and also the S-Schwarzschild in two different ways.\nAddition of charge can be done via Weyl's electrification method [20, 23, 52].\nThe analytic continuation in Weyl space to obtain the hyperbolic Witten bubble is precisely the same as in [15], except here the Schwarzschild rod crosses z = 0. Even-in-z\nIsrael-Khan arrays where no rod crosses z = 0 can be analytically continued to gravitational\n\n30\n\n\fwave solutions sourced by imaginary black holes, ie rods at imaginary time. We can thus\ngeneralize the Witten bubble by adding additional waves by symmetrically placing more rods\nin addition to the one which crosses z = 0. We dub such an array the 'hyperbolic-perturbed\nWitten bubble.' As these additional rods are made to cover more of the z-axis and are\nbrought closer and closer to the principal rod, the deformed Witten bubble solution hangs\nlonger with a minimum-radius \u03c6-circle. In the limit where rods occupy the entire z-axis, we\nget a static flat solution, which is Minkowski 3-space times a fixed-circumference \u03c6-circle.\nThe hyperbolic-perturbed Witten bubble can be turned on its side, yielding a hyperbolicperturbed S-Schwarzschild. It has the card diagram structure of Fig. 17.\nWe can also perturb S-Schwarzschild by adding rods before analytically continuing z \u2192\ni\u03c4 , M \u2192 iM. We dub this the 'elliptic-perturbed S-Schwarzschild.' It is different than\nhyperbolic-perturbed S-Schwarzschild, and has the card diagram structure of Fig. 14. Turned\non its side, it yields an elliptic-perturbed Witten bubble, with the card diagram structure of\nFig. 13. It is different than the hyperbolic-perturbed Witten bubble.\nIn any of the cases, we can choose to analytically continue the mass parameters of the\nadditional rods or not. Additionally, we can displace some rods in the imaginary z-direction\nwhich affects the \u03c4 -center of their disturbance. If we do everything in an even fashion, i.e. we\nrespect Im \u03c4 \u2192 \u2212Im \u03c4 , the resulting geometry (at real \u03c4 ) will be real. In particular, rotating\na rod at z > 0 counterclockwise means rotating its image at z < 0 clockwise. We see in the\ndiscussion of the 2-rod example [20] that there may be several choices for branches.\nThe card diagram techniques allow us to easily construct these two inequivalent families of\nperturbed Witten bubble and perturbed S-Schwarzschild solutions. These and other multirod, S-dihole, and infinite-periodic-universe solutions are described in [20] and cannot be\neasily described or understood without Weyl coordinates and the construction and language\nof card diagrams. The nontrivial z \u2192 i\u03c4 continuation is essential.\n\nB\n\nAppendix: Electrostatic Weyl formalism\n\nThe formalism of [22] can be extended for general D to include an electrostatic potential.\nThis is somewhat surprising since the electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor\n1\nT\u03bc\u03bd = F\u03bc\u03c1 F\u03bd \u03c1 \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd F 2\n4\nis traceless only in D = 4 and so Einstein's equations are more complicated.
