There is mounting evidence that in\nmany young stellar systems dust grains have sizes reaching cm (Testi et al. 2003; Acke et al. 2004; Natta et al.\n2004), in contrast to sub-micron sizes of the ISM dust\nparticles, which is a natural consequence of grain growth\nby coagulation. This process is often accompanied by\nthe change of the material properties of dust grains indicated by their increased chrystallinity (van Boekel et al.\n2005) and by settling of dust towards the disk midplane\ninferred from the change of the shape of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of disks (Acke et al. 2004). Observational evidence for dust growth exists not only in\nprotoplanetary disks around T Tauri stars (stellar mass\nM\u22c6 . 2 M\u2299 ), but also in their analogs around higher\nmass (2 M\u2299 . M\u22c6 . 10 M\u2299 ) Herbig Ae/Be stars (van\nKerckhoven, Tielens, & Waelkens 2002; Sloan et al. 2005;\nSch\u00fctz, Meeus, & Sterzik 2005; Habart et al. 2005), as\nwell as in disks around substellar objects (Apai et al.\n2005).\nAt the same time, recent observations of the polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) spectral features in disks\nof Herbig Ae/Be stars (Meeus et al. 2001; Acke & van\nden Ancker 2004) provide evidence for the presence of\na significant population of very small dust grains (sizes\na \u223c 3 \u2212 100 \u00c5) in these disks. Previously, the existence of a significant amount of carbonaceous nanoparticles in the ISM has been proposed to explain the IRAS\nobservations of \"unidentified infrared\" emission features\nand strong mid-infrared emission component resulting\n1\n\nCITA, McLennan Physics Labs, 60 St. George St., University\nof Toronto, Toronto ON M5S 3H8 Canada; rrr@cita.utoronto.ca\n2 Canada Research Chair\n\nfrom the starlight reprocessing by the ultrasmall grains\n(Boulanger & P\u00e9rault 1988). The proposed fraction of\nthe ISM carbon mass locked up in very small grains\nconsiderably exceeds that implied by the extension of\nthe conventional MRN dust size distribution (Mathis,\nRumpl, & Nordsieck 1977) to very small sizes, below 50\n\u00c5. This suggests the existence of a separate population of\nvery small carbonaceous grains which is distinct from the\nMRN distribution and contains \u223c 10% of C in the ISM\n(Leger & Puget 1984; Draine & Anderson 1985). Thus,\nit is not surprising that nanoscale dust particles should\nexist at some level in disks3 around Herbig Ae/Be stars\nsince the latter were originally part of the ISM. However,\nthe detailed modeling of the IR emission features in these\nsystems suggests that PAHs may contain as much as several tens of per cent of total C mass in disks (Habart,\nNatta & Kr\u00fcgel 2004). Thus, it appear that small dust\npopulation in these disks does not only withstand coagulation, but on the contrary may have gained some\nadditional mass, presumably due to the fragmentation\nof larger particles. This suggests very interesting sizedependent evolution of the dust population in Herbig\nAe/Be disks. In the case of disks around T Tauri stars\nand brown dwarfs it is difficult to make definite statements about the presence of small dust grains because of\nthe lack of strong stellar UV fluxes needed for exciting\nPAH molecules (although see G\u00fcrtler et al. 1999).\nIn this paper we describe a new observational channel for probing the presence and properties of very small\ndust grains in disks around young stellar objects. In\nthe outer parts of these disks, \u223c 102 AU from the central star, nanometer-size dust particles spin at thermal\n3 Possible origin of observed PAH emission in the roughly spherical envelopes around stars rather than in disks is unlikely given\nthe correlation between the strength of the PAH emission and the\ndisk geometry inferred from the SED shape (Habart et al. 2004).\n\n\f2\nrates of several tens of GHz. Because of their intrinsic dipole moments, these \"macromolecules\" emit electric\ndipole radiation in the microwave band where the thermal Rayleigh-Jeans emission of the circumstellar disk is\nrather weak. This makes it possible to disentangle the\nspinning dust contribution to the disk emission and study\nthe properties of this dust component. We describe the\nphysics of the spinning dust emission and analyze its observational signatures in \u00a72. Applications of our results\nare discussed in \u00a73.\n2. emission from spinning dust grains.\n\nFerrara & Dettmar (1994) proposed that charged ISM\ndust grains spinning at thermal rates can produce observable microwave emission via electric dipole radiation.\nThis mechanism has been further investigated in detail\nby Draine and Lazarian (1998b; hereafter DL98) who\nconsidered, among other things, intrinsic dipole moments\nof grains, various processes governing the nonthermal\nspin rates of grains, and a size distribution of emitting\nnanoscale particles consistent with previous detections\nof PAH emission from the ISM. In this paper we will\nlargely follow the approach adopted in these pioneering\ninvestigations.\n2.1. Circumstellar disk model.\nWe describe the structure of the circumstellar disk using conventional two-temperature flared disk model of\nChiang & Goldreich (1997) which states that the vertical\nextent of the disk can be split into two well-defined regions: upper exposed layer in which dust absorbs most of\nthe incoming starlight and reradiates it in the infrared,\nand lower shielded region which is hidden from direct\nstarlight and is warmed only by the reprocessed radiation\nof the outer layer. For our purposes both layers can be\nconsidered isothermal with different temperatures. Temperature of the shielded layer Tsh is lower than that of\nthe overlaying exposed layer by a factor of several.\nThe amount of mass contained in the exposed layer\nis very small: fraction of the total disk surface density \u03a3 corresponding to this layer is \u223c \u03b3/[\u03baP (T\u22c6 )\u03a3],\nwhere \u03b3 . 0.1 is the disk flaring angle and \u03baP (T\u22c6 ) is\nthe Planck opacity at the stellar temperature. Since\nit is likely that even in the distant parts of the disk\n\u03baP (T\u22c6 )\u03a3 \u226b 1, shielded region must contain most of\nthe disk mass. Thus, if small particles are well mixed\nthroughout the disk (which is a reasonable assumption\nfor very small grains having settling times longer than\nthe disk lifetime) most of the small dust particles must\nbe shielded from the direct stellar illumination by the\nouter exposed layer. This inference significantly simplifies our subsequent treatment.\nWe assume a simple power-law profile for the disk surface density\n\u03a3(r) = \u03a31 r1\u2212\u03b1 ,\n(1)\nwhere r1 is the distance from the star normalized by 1\nAU, \u03a31 is the surface density at 1 AU, and \u03b1 is a parameter that we can vary. Midplane temperature profile\nTsh (r) needed for the calculation of the grain spin rates\nis computed in Appendix A according to the prescription\nof the flared disk model of Chiang & Goldreich (1997).\nAt the low temperatures of interest for us opacity \u03ba\u03bd\nis due to dust grains. At long wavelengths \u03ba\u03bd typically\n\nscales as a power law of \u03bd and we adopt in this study\n(following the notation of Beckwith et al. 1990)\n\u03b2\n\u03ba\u03bd = \u03ba12 \u03bd12\n,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03bd12 = \u03bd/(1012 Hz) is the radiation frequency normalized by 1012 Hz and \u03ba12 is the opacity at 1012 Hz.\nPower law index \u03b2 can be directly measured from the\ndisk SED in the submillimeter range and in protoplanetary disks it varies from 0.3 to 1.5 (Kitamura et al.\n2002), while ISM emission is characterized by \u03b2 \u2248 1.7\n(Finkbeiner, Davis, & Schlegel 1999). Small values of \u03b2\nin protoplanetary disks are interpreted as the evidence\nfor grain growth (Natta et al. 2004; Draine 2005).\nNormalization of opacity at a given frequency \u03ba12 is\nrather poorly constrained. Beckwith et al. (1990) advocate using \u03ba12 = 0.1 cm2 g\u22121 while Kramer et al. (1998)\nfind \u03ba(1.2 mm) \u2248 0.004 cm2 g\u22121 which translates into\n\u03ba12 \u2248 0.016 cm2 g\u22121 for \u03b2 = 1. Draine (2005) modeled\nabsorbing properties of evolved dust populations composed of different materials with MRN size distributions\nextending to maximum size amax \u223c 1 \u2212 10 cm and found\n\u03b2 \u2248 1 \u2212 1.5 and \u03ba12 \u223c 0.01 \u2212 0.1 cm2 g\u22121 (for the dustto-gas ratio 10\u22122 ). Thus, there is at least an order of\nmagnitude spread in the possible values of \u03ba12 .\n2.2. Spinning dust emissivity.\nMidplane regions of circumstellar disks have very low\ndegree of ionization because of intrinsic low temperature\nand strong shielding of the ionizing stellar radiation and\ncosmic ray fluxes by the overlying disk layers. As a result,\ndust grains in the shielded layer are predominantly neutral and their dipole moments are intrinsic and not due\nto an asymmetric charge distribution. Following DL98\nwe assume very small dust grains to be composed of randomly oriented chemical substructures so that the total\nintrinsic dipole moment of the grain scales with the number of atoms in the grain N as\nd \u2248 N 1/2 d0 .\n\n(3)\n\nBased on the available laboratory data on the dipole\nmoments of the PAH-like particles DL98 have chosen\nd0 = 0.4 debye in their study, and we adopt this estimate as well.\nThe power emitted by a grain of radius a spinning at\nfrequency \u03c9 is given by\nP (a, \u03c9) =\n\n16\u03c0 d20 \u03c9 4 \u03c1a3\n4 d2 (a)\u03c9 4\n=\n,\n3\n9 c\n27 c3 \u03bcd\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the bulk density of grain material and \u03bcd is the\nmean mass of grain atom (\u03bcd \u2248 9.25 amu for C:H=3:1\ncarbonaceous material typical for PAHs). In deriving\nequation (4) we assumed that grains are spherical [so that\nd2 (a) = d20 (4\u03c0\u03c1a3 )/(3\u03bcd )] and that their dipole moments\nare randomly oriented with respect to their rotational\naxes.\nTo calculate the spectrum of the dipole emission of\nspinning grains we also need to know the size distribution\nof nanoscale dust particles. Contrary to the expectation\nof small dust depletion4 in circumstellar disks, recent observations of PAH features in Herbig Ae/Be disks suggest\n4 DL98 assumed that in dense interstellar clouds PAHs are depleted by a factor of 5.\n\n\f3\nthat very small grains may actually be more abundant\nin these systems than in the ISM (Habart et al. 2004).\nBy analogy with DL98, we use the following functional\nform for the grain size distribution\n(\n\u0014\n\u00152 )\n1 ln(a/a0 )\n1 dn\n\u22123.5 B\n, (5)\n= AMRN a\n+ exp \u2212\nnH da\na\n2\n\u03c3\n\n1\n0.1\n\nwhere AMRN = 6.9 \u00d7 10\u221226 cm2.5 (Draine & Lee 1984)\nand B are constants, a0 is the typical size of very small\ncarbonaceous grains, and \u03c3 is the width of their lognormal distribution. The first term is a conventional\nMRN contribution while the second accounts for very\nsmall grains. Coefficient B is chosen in such a way that\nthe fraction of C locked up in very small grains (with respect to the total abundance C/H=4 \u00d7 10\u22124 ) is fC . Our\nbaseline model uses fC = 0.05 (close to the ISM value),\na0 = 3 \u00c5 and \u03c3 = 0.5, this distribution extends down to\na minimum size amin = 3.5 \u00c5.\n2.3. Grain spin rates.\nRotation rates of small dust grains are in general governed by a combination of physical processes: collisions\nof grains with neutral molecules, Coulomb interactions\nwith charged species, infrared and electric dipole emission, etc. (DL98). Since here we are mainly interested in\nobtaining reasonable estimate of the importance of the\nspinning dust emission in disks, we assume that grain\nrotation is determined by thermal equilibrium.\nThis assumption is reasonable in the midplane region\nof the circumstellar disk because of the high gas density\nand very low ionization fraction there. Consequently, interactions of predominantly neutral dust grains with extremely rare charged particles (plasma drag/excitation\nand rotational excitation by ion collisions, which are often the most important determinants of grain spin rates\nin the ISM, see the case of molecular cloud environment\nin DL98) are completely negligible in this part of disk.\nAs a result, grain-neutral collisions bring particle spin\nrates in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding gas5 .\nThis implies that grain spin rates have Boltzmann distribution\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u00133/2\n\u0012\n3\n\u03c92\n3 \u03c92\n,\n(6)\nf\u03c9 (\u03c9) = 4\u03c0\nexp\n\u2212\n2\u03c0\n2 h\u03c9 2 i\nh\u03c9 2 i3/2\nwith the rms rotation rate h\u03c9 2 i1/2 given by\n\u0012\n\u00131/2\n3kB T\n1/2 5/2\nh\u03c9 2 i1/2 =\n\u2248 3.5 \u00d7 1010 T2 a\u22127 s\u22121 , (7)\nI\nwhere T2 is the gas temperature normalized to 102 K,\na\u22127 is the grain radius in units of 10\u22127 cm, and we take\n\u03c1 = 2 g cm\u22123 . For simplicity, we assume grain shapes\nto be close to spherical implying that their moment of\ninertia is I = (8\u03c0/15)\u03c1a5 , although very small particles,\nlike PAHs, are likely to be sheetlike (see DL98 for more\nrefined treatment).\nWithin the upper exposed layer grains may spin at\nsignificantly non-thermal rates (corresponding to temperatures higher than the midplane temperature) but\nthe amount of mass contained in this layer is very small\nmeaning that its contribution to the total spinning dust\nemission can be neglected in the first approximation.\n5\n\nInfrared emission by grains is unlikely to strongly affect their\nspin rates because of low midplane temperatures.\n\n1\n0.1\n\n1\n0.1\n\nFig. 1.- Spectrum of the microwave disk emission for systems\ndescribed by Models 1 (a), 2 (b), and 3 (c) placed 100 pc away\nfrom us.

As a result, one can hope to detect the spinning\ndust emission only at long wavelengths where F\u03bdsd may\ndominate over F\u03bdth .\nIn Figure 1 we plot spectra of the spinning dust emission computed according to the prescription (8) for circumstellar disks with different central objects at different\nevolutionary stages \u2013 massive Herbig Ae/Be star, solartype T Tauri star, and a brown dwarf. Adopted parameters of these systems are listed in Table A1 and are the\nsame7 as in Dullemond & Natta (2003). In all models\nwe use \u03b1 = 1, \u03b2 = 1, \u03ba12 = 0.05 cm2 g\u22121 and adopt a\nbaseline model of the grain size distribution (5) with parameters listed in \u00a72 2.2. Disks are assumed to be located\n100 pc away from us.\nOne can see that all three models exhibit significant excesses due to the spinning dust emission around 30 GHz.\nThis component exceeds the thermal power law contribution by a factor ranging from 3 to 6. Excess appears\nfirst at frequencies of about 50 GHz \u2013 typical spin frequency of dust grains at low temperatures, see equation\n(7) \u2013 and extends all the way to lower frequencies.\n2.5. Sensitivity to stellar and disk parameters.\nThe appearance of the SED including the spinning dust\ncomponent depends on a large number of stellar, dust,\nand disk parameters: M\u22c6 , R\u22c6 , \u03a31 , \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03ba12 , etc. To test\nsensitivity to different parameters we have varied them\none at a time to see how spectrum evolves with respect\nto a fixed fiducial model of the disk+star system. As a\nfiducial stellar model we have adopted T Tauri model 2\nbut with M\u22c6 = 1 M\u22c6 and ain = 0.3 AU for the inner\nedge of the disk. Fiducial model also uses \u03b1 = 1, \u03b2 = 1,\n\u03ba12 = 0.05 cm2 g\u22121 . Parameters of the fiducial dust\nmodel are specified in \u00a72 2.2.\nFigure A2 demonstrates how the total microwave spectrum of the disk F\u03bdsd + F\u03bdth changes due to the parameter variation. Figure A3 shows the same but for the\nratio of fluxes F\u03bdsd /F\u03bdth . These plots demonstrate that\nthe microwave spectrum is insensitive to either stellar\nmass M\u22c6 or Rin . The former appears only in the calculation of the radial temperature profile (see Appendix\nA) which depends on M\u22c6 only weakly. The inner radius\nof the disk does not play any role since at cm wavelengths both the spinning dust emission and the thermal\nemission of the disk are dominated by the outer region,\n6 This expression accounts for the fact that at long wavelengths\nF\u03bdth is dominated by the cool shielded region and the contribution\nof the warm exposed layer is small.\n7 Except the surface density normalization in the T Tauri model\nwhich in our case is comparable to the Minimum Mass Solar Nebula\nvalue.\n\nr \u223c Rout . Variation of Rout changes mass of the emitting gas which mainly affects the overall flux level (Figure A2g) but also changes F\u03bdsd /F\u03bdth somewhat (Figure\nA3g). The same is true for the spectral sensitivity to\n\u03a31 and \u03b1 \u2013 variation of both parameters mainly affects\nthe emitting dust mass, so the characteristic pattern of\nspectral evolution is similar to that caused by changing\nRout (Figures A2b,f and A3b,f). Spectral sensitivity to\nT\u22c6 and R\u22c6 is similar as both parameters determine the\nstellar luminosity. Changing the parameters of the small\ndust size distribution \u2013 a0 , \u03c3, and fC \u2013 affects both shape\nand normalization of the spinning dust spectrum leaving\nthe thermal disk emission (dominated by large grains)\nunaffected.\nVariations of \u03ba12 do not affect the spinning dust emission but change the optical depth of the disk which then\naffects F\u03bdth , see Figure A2j. As a result, for low enough\nopacity (e.g. \u03ba12 = 0.01 cm2 g\u22121 ) spinning dust emission\ncan dominate over the thermal disk emission by more\nthan an order of magnitude at \u03bd . 30 GHz (see Figure\nA3j). Similar effect is produced by the variation of the\ndust emissivity index \u03b2 \u2013 it changes the thermal flux of\nthe disk by orders of magnitude since F\u03bdth \u221d \u03bd 2+\u03b2 , see\nFigures A2k and A3k.\nTotal power produced by the disk determines whether\nit can be detected in a flux limited observation. But\neven if such a detection is made, one can disentangle the\nspinning dust component from the thermal disk emission\nonly if F\u03bdsd /F\u03bdth & 1. Examination of Figure A3 demonstrates that this is most easily done for small \u03ba12 and/or\nlarge \u03b2. Coagulation of dust particles in dense circumstellar disks environments generally tends to decrease \u03b2\n(sometimes below 1), which would hide the spinning dust\nemission bump in the thermal power law component of\nthe spectrum (see the curve for \u03b2 = 0.5 in Figure A2k).\nThus, from the observational point of view the most favorable chances of detecting the spinning dust emission\nwould be in systems having steep sub-mm slopes of the\nSED (\u03b2 & 1).\n3. discussion.\n\nThere is strong evidence for the presence of the spinning dust emission in the data obtained by the CMB experiments (Draine & Lazarian 1998a; Finkbeiner 2004;\nalthough see Bennet et al. 2004 for the opposite conclusion) and by the recent Green Bank Galactic Plane\nSurvey (Finkbeiner, Langston, & Minter 2004). It appears that the microwave emission of the spinning dust\nin the ISM is an established physical phenomenon with\nsubstantial observational support. For this reason there\nis little doubt that it should also be present in the\ncircumstellar disk environments and the two remaining issues would then be of quantitative nature: what\nis the strength of this emission and whether it could\nbe observed. Results presented in the previous section\nclearly demonstrate that the spinning dust contribution\nto the microwave emission is substantial and in many\ncases significantly exceeds the thermal dust emission at\n\u03bd . 30 \u2212 50 GHz.\nThe answer to the second question strongly depends\non the presence of other spectral contributions in the microwave band. These include free-free emission from the\ngas heated by the central star or by the nearby massive\nstars and synchrotron emission from jets and outflows\n\n\f5\nwhich accompany large fraction of the young stellar objects. Spinning dust emission can be discriminated from\nthese components based on its intrinsic bell-like spectral\nshape since both free-free and synchrotron are characterized by power-law spectra. Power-law spectral tails at cm\nwavelengths extending sometimes for more than a decade\nin frequency have indeed been observed in some objects\n(Zapata et al. 2005; Eisner & Carpenter 2006) suggesting\nthe contamination by free-free and synchrotron emission.\nGiven broad enough frequency coverage in the radio one\ncan detect these power law components at lower frequencies, extrapolate them to 10 \u2212 50 GHz and subtract from\nthe total flux. Spinning dust emission will be present in\nthe remaining flux provided that it dominates over such\npower law contaminants (its detection would be facilitated by its intrinsic spectral shape).\nAnother way of deducing possible free-free contamination is to look for H\u03b1 emission from the same object\nsince both components originate in the same hot gas.\nThis would give a useful handle on the expected strength\nof the free-free flux at low frequencies and demonstrate\na priori whether it can compete with the spinning dust\nemission in the microwave domain. Synchrotron contribution can be identified based on its polarization and\nthe morphology of the synchrotron emitting outflows (for\nwhich reasonable quality imaging would be required).\nProvided that these difficulties can be successfully\novercome, the potential detection (or nondetection) of\nthe spinning dust emission can give us very interesting\ninformation on the small dust population in the circumstellar disks. There is already strong evidence for the existence of such population in disks around Herbig Ae/Be\nstars based on the detection of PAH emission features in\nthe 6 \u2212 12 \u03bcm band (van Kerckhoven et al. 2002; Sh\u00fctz\net al. 2005; Sloan et al. 2005; Habart et al. 2005) excited\nby copious UV flux of the central star. The total mass of\nnanoparticles producing near-IR emission features is very\nsmall (10\u22124 \u2212 10\u22125 M\u2295 , see van Kerckhoven et al. 2002)\nbut one has to remember that the favorable PAH excitation conditions exist only in the very thin outermost\nlayer of the disk where the stellar UV flux gets fully absorbed. As a result, emission in PAH bands shows only\nthe very tip of the iceberg as it traces an insignificant\nfraction of the total population of small dust. Most of the\nnanoparticles must be hidden from stellar UV near the\ndisk midplane (provided that they are homogeneously\ndistributed) and constitute substantial fraction of the total dust population (containing up to 30% of the total C\nabundance, see Habart et al. 2004). As the spinning dust\nemission is contributed by all small dust particles (disk\nis optically thin at microwave frequencies), its detection\nwould give us a very useful probe of the total mass in\nnanoparticles. Combined with the model for the disk\nstructure, the comparison of the near-IR PAH observations and the spinning dust emission would provide a\nvery good consistency check for the two probes of the\nsmall dust population.\nA nondetection of the spinning dust emission in Herbig\nAe/Be systems may suggest that either (1) vertical mixing in disks around these stars is for some reason inhibited (which is unlikely given that the magnetorotational\ninstability is expected to operate at least in the upper\ndisk layers) or (2) PAH formation is catalyzed by stellar\nUV in the uppermost disk layer and they are rapidly de-\n\nstroyed in its interior. Both possibilities appear rather\nexotic. Note that because of the high stellar temperature the contamination with free-free emission may be\nespecially severe in Herbig Ae/Be systems, potentially\nallowing only the upper limits to be set on the flux due\nto the spinning dust.\nWith only few exceptions (e.g. G\u00fcrtler et al. 1999)\nmid-IR PAH emission has not been detected in disks\naround T Tauri stars or brown dwarves. This fact is\nconsistent with the lack of strong UV flux in this objects, which is necessary for efficient excitation of the\nPAH features (although see Li & Draine 2002 and Smith,\nClayton, & Valencic 2004 for a different opinion), and\nshould not be immediately interpreted as the evidence\nfor the absence of the nanoparticle dust component in\nthese systems. Because of lack of the PAH emission, the\nmicrowave emission of spinning dust may be the only8\nway in which the small dust could be probed in T Tauri\nand brown dwarf disks.\nUnlike the mid-IR PAH features, spinning dust emission reveals the whole nanoparticle dust population of\nthe disk, which is important in many respects. Small\nparticles affect the ionization balance within the disk\nsince they dominate the dust surface area and are very\nefficient at immobilization of free charges. This works\nagainst the operation of the magnetorotational instability in protoplanetary disks (Fleming & Stone 2003)\nwhich, in turn, affects the sizes and positions of the\nso-called \"dead zones\" of quiescent non-turbulent material (Gammie 1996), with potential consequences for\nthe planet formation (Matsumura & Pudritz 2005, 2006).\nSmall grains also affect heating of gas in the upper rarefied disk layers due to the higher yield of electrons from\nPAHs (Kamp & Dullemond 2004).\nThe very existence of substantial amounts of nanoparticles is very interesting from the evolutionary point of\nview since dust grains are expected to grow as disks age.\nRecent discoveries of PAHs in Herbig Ae/Be disks in\namounts exceeding those in the ISM (Habart et al. 2005)\nare at odds with this expectation but may be in line\nwith the recent work of Dullemond & Dominik (2005)\nwho found that dust fragmentation, in addition to coagulation, has to be an important ingredient of the dust\nevolution. It may also be the case that the material properties of small and large grains (e.g. sticking coefficient)\nare completely different leading to divergent evolutionary\npaths of the two extremes of the grain size distribution.\nDetection of the spinning dust emission from circumstellar disks may shed enough light on the properties of the\nsmall dust population to resolve this puzzle.\nCalculations presented in \u00a72 were intended to provide\nus with the rough idea for the importance of the spinning dust emission and as such they neglected a number\nof details. Among them are the realistic distribution of\nshapes of the nanoscale dust particles, emission of spinning dust in the exposed layer associated with the nonthermal grain rotation rates, possible ionization of small\ndust particles, and so on. In the future observational demands may warrant a more refined study including these\ndetails.\n8 The contribution of very small particles to opacity is degenerate\nwith that of large grains.\n\n\f6\n4. summary.\n\nWe have studied the electric dipole emission produced\nby spinning dust grains of very small size (several to tens\nnm) in circumstellar disks. At the temperatures characteristic for these environments spinning grains emit in\nthe microwave range with the peak of the emission occurring at \u223c 30 \u2212 50 GHz. For typical parameters of disks\naround Herbig Ae/Be stars, T Tauri stars, and brown\ndwarves we find spinning dust emission to dominate over\nthe thermal disk emission by a factor of at least several\nat \u03bd . 50 GHz (if nanoparticles contain & 5% of the\ntotal C abundance). We have studied the sensitivity of\nthis emission component to various stellar, disk, and dust\nparameters and found it to be strongest for variations of\nthe total dust opacity - both normalization of \u03ba\u03bd and\n\nthe slope of its frequency dependence. Provided that\nthe contamination of the spinning dust emission by the\nfree-free and/or synchrotron emission can be mitigated,\nthe best chances of detecting this emission component\nshould be in systems with steep sub-mm spectral indices\nminimizing the contribution of the thermal disk emission. Detection (or non-detection) of the spinning dust\nemission will provide important information about the\nexistence, properties, and origin of the nanoscale dust\nparticles in circumstellar disks.\n\nRRR thankfully acknowledges the support of this work\nby the Canada Research Chairs program and Connaught\nFoundation.\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nradial temperature profile in the disk midplane.\n4\nThermal balance of the shielded region is set by (\u03b4/4)T\u22c64 (R\u22c6 /a)2 \u03c8ex = Tsh\n\u03c8sh , where Tsh and Tex are the characteristic temperatures of the shielded and exposed regions respectively and \u03c8ex and \u03c8sh are the fractions of the radiative\nflux with blackbody temperatures Tex and Tsh absorbed by the disk.
