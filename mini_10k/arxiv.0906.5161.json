If the equation of state of this fluid does not evolve and is w = p/\u03c1 = \u22121,\nthen dark energy is a cosmological constant. In this case, observations give a value of the cosmological constant\nthat is 120 orders of magnitude smaller than the theoretically expected evaluation. We still lack a convincing way\nof understanding this issue. As a result, an approach towards making progress is to assume that the cosmological\nconstant/dark energy stem from some new physics.1\nEver since the observational evidence of late-time acceleration, model builders have sought to find a candidate for\ndark energy. However, this task is daunting as it is hard to identify an existing degree of freedom in the standard\nmodel or general relativity that (i) has negative pressure, (ii) is homogeneous on horizon scales and (iii) matches the\nobserved energy scale. This initially led to quintessence models where a new fundamental scalar degree of freedom\nwith a fine-tuned potential can be adjusted to yield a late-time acceleration tracking dark matter. Alternatively,\ninvestigators have invoked infrared modifications of general relativity, for instance f (R) or Gauss\u2013Bonnet gravity.\nWhile successful, many representatives in both classes of models suffer from fine-tuning or other theoretical problems\ndue to the introduction of new degrees of freedom.\nIn this work, we take a minimalistic approach to dark energy assuming no extra degrees of freedom except fermionic\nmatter on a flat Friedmann\u2013Lema\u0131\u0302tre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker (FLRW) background. A finite density of fermions in the\nearly universe can undergo a Bardeen\u2013Cooper\u2013Schrieffer (BCS) condensation due to a covariant attractive channel\nfrom general relativity. The system is described by a set of transcendental equations that give relations between the\nscale factor, the fermion gap and the chemical potential. It was already shown in [4\u20136] that such a BCS condensate\ncan play an important role in the early universe by resolving the big bang singularity via a bounce. Remarkably, we\nfind that depending upon some of the parameters of the theory, the same condensate can also affect the history of\nthe universe at late times. In this paper we will show that the nonperturbative potential of the fermion gap can lead\nto late-time acceleration.2\nThis is achieved by extending the analysis of [6], which was applied near a cosmological bounce where the gap\nequation could be obtained in a Minkowski spacetime. Here we work on a FLRW background and consider the\nevolution of the universe from the bounce on. As a consistency check, we obtain gap equations similar3 to those\nin [6] and reproduce the same bouncing cosmology. A mechanism of fermion condensation was argued to be relevant\nto dark energy also in [7, 8] (see also [9, 10]); for another approach describing fermions and condensates on FLRW\nspacetimes, see [11\u201313].\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we introduce the BCS mechanism on a FLRW background and derive\nthe effective equations of motion. This section is a little technical and the reader mostly interested in the cosmology\ncan skip ahead to Sec. III, where we classify the cosmological solutions and find numerical examples which accelerate\nat late times. Section IV is devoted to discussion.\n\nII.\n\nCOSMOLOGICAL BCS THEORY\n\nWe use Greek indices \u03bc, \u03bd, * * * = 0, . . . , 3 for spacetime directions in a nondegenerate manifold M (with signature\n\u2212+++) and capital Latin indices I, J, * * * = 0, . . . , 3 for the internal Lorentzian tangent space TM . Spatial directions\non M and TM will be denoted as a, b, c, . . . and i, j, k, . . . , respectively. Dotted and undotted indices \u03b1\u0307, \u03b1 label spinor\ncomponents. We work in units ~ = c = G = 1.\nWe begin by studying the cosmology of first-order general relativity covariantly coupled to Dirac fermions. In such a\nsystem a four-fermion interaction emerges when we solve for the torsion. In what follows, we show that this interaction\nin a FLRW background realizes a BCS condensate whose potential generically leads to late-time acceleration.\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n\nFor alternative approaches which try to avoid dark energy by invoking large scale inhomogeneities see, for instance, [1\u20133].\nOn the other hand, the present proposal does not address either the smallness or coincidence problem for the cosmological constant,\nalthough it does relax the former. These issues will require a better understanding of the regularization mechanism (see below), which\ngoes beyond the scope of this work.\nSome of the coefficients differ slightly. This is mainly because here for simplicity we only consider the scalar channel of the four-fermion\ninteraction, while in [6] we also included the pseudoscalar interaction. Also, unlike in [6], we do not throw away the contributions from\nthe antifermions. These differences do not affect the physics, since the coefficients have the same sign.\n\n\f3\nA.\n\nFermions in FLRW background\n\nLet us start by considering pure general relativity described by the Holst action [14]. Afterwards we sketch how\nthe attractive four-fermion interaction emerges after solving for the torsion. The action on a curved manifold M is\n\u0012Z\n\u0013\nZ\n1\n1\n\u03bc \u03bd\n\u03bc \u03bd\n4\nIJ\n4\nIJ\nSH =\n,\n(II.1)\nd x e eI eJ R\u03bc\u03bd \u2212\nd x e eI eJ R\u0303\u03bc\u03bd\n16\u03c0\n\u03b3 M\nM\nwhere eI\u03bc is the gravitational field (vielbein, tetrad), e \u2261 | det e\u03bcI |, R\u03bc\u03bdIJ is the curvature of the spin connection A\u03bcIJ ,\n\u03b3 is the Barbero\u2013Immirzi parameter and R\u0303\u03bc\u03bdIJ = \u01ebIJKL R\u03bc\u03bdKL /2 is the dual field strength.\nThe first term in Eq. (II.1) yields the Palatini formulation of the Einstein\u2013Hilbert action, the latter emerging when\ninserting the solution to the associated equation of motion\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(II.2)\nA\u03bcIJ = \u03c9 \u03bcIJ [e] = e\u03bdI e\u03bcJ,\u03bd \u2212 \u0393\u03bc\u03c1\u03bd e\u03c1J\n(where \u0393\u03bc\u03c1\u03bd are the Christoffel symbols) into Eq. (II.1) and using g\u03bc\u03bd = eI\u03bc eJ\u03bd \u03b7IJ . The second term is identically zero\non half-shell, due to the Bianchi identity for the Riemann tensor. \u03c9\u03bcKL is the metric-compatible, torsion-free spin\nconnection.\nThe story changes when we covariantly couple chiral fermions to the gravitational action. The Dirac action for\nfermions \u03c8 is\nZ\n\u0001\ni\nSD = \u2212\nd4 xe \u03c8\u0304\u03b3 I eI \u03bc \u2207\u03bc \u03c8 + c.c. ,\n(II.3)\n2 M\nwhere c.c. denotes the complex conjugate and the covariant derivative is defined as \u2207\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc \u2212 \u03a9\u03bc , where\n\u03a9\u03bc =\n\n1\nAIJ\u03bc \u03a3IJ ,\n4\n\n(II.4)\n\n1 I J\n[\u03b3 , \u03b3 ]\n2\n\n(II.5)\n\nand\n\u03a3IJ \u2261\n\nare the Lorentz generators for spinors. \u03b3 I are the usual Dirac matrices in Weyl (chiral) basis,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n0 \u03c3I\nI 0\nI\n\u03b3 =\n,\n,\n\u03b35 =\n0 \u2212I\n\u03c3\u0304 I 0\nwhere \u03c3 I = (I, \u2212\u03c3 i ), \u03c3\u0304 I = (I, \u03c3 i ) and \u03c3 i are the Pauli matrices:\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n0 \u2212i\n0 1\n2\n1\n,\n,\n\u03c3 =\n\u03c3 =\ni 0\n1 0\n\n3\n\n\u03c3 =\n\n\u0012\n\n1 0\n0 \u22121\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(II.6)\n\n(II.7)\n\nNote that a tetrad-based formalism is essential for the inclusion of fermions in the theory, since Dirac spinors live\nnaturally in SU (2).\nThe equation of motion for the total action SH +SD are solved in terms of a connection A\u03bcIJ having two contributions\n[15\u201317], the torsion-free spin connection and a torsion term related to the axial fermion current:\nA\u03bcIJ = \u03c9\u03bcIJ [e] + C\u03bcIJ ,\n\n(II.8)\n\nwhere C\u03bcIJ is the tetrad projection of the contortion tensor,\nC\u03bcIJ = C\u03bc\u03bd\u03b4 eI[\u03bd eJ\u03b4] .\n\n(II.9)\n\nSquare brackets denote antisymmetrization, X[IJ] = (XIJ \u2212 XJI )/2.\nOn solving for C\u03bcIJ in terms of the fermionic field and inserting the resulting expression for A\u03bcIJ in the total action,\none obtains the four-fermion interaction (see the Appendix for a detailed derivation)\nZ\nJ5I J5I\n1\n3\u03c0 \u03b3 2\nSint =\nd4 x e\n,\n=\n,\n(II.10)\nM2\nM2\n2 \u03b32 + 1\nM\n\n\f4\nwhere J5I = \u03c8\u0304\u03b35 \u03b3 I \u03c8 is the axial current. Therefore, the fermionic action is now\nSfer = SD + Sint ,\n\n(II.11)\n\nwhere the covariant derivative in SD is in terms of \u03c9\u03bcIJ . For a flat FLRW line element\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + a2 (t) dxa dxa ,\n\n(II.12)\n\nthe vielbein is given by\nI\n\ne\u03bc =\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n0\n0 a(t)\u03b4ai\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(II.13)\n\nwhere a(t) is the scale factor. The only nonzero structure functions and spin connections \u03c9IJK are\n\u03c90ij = \u2212\u03c9i0j = \u2212H\u03b4ij ,\nwhere H \u2261 \u0227/a is the Hubble parameter. Then,\naH\n\u03b4aj\n\u03a9a = \u2212\n2\n\n\u03a90 = 0 ,\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c3j 0\n0 \u2212\u03c3 j\n\n(II.14)\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(II.15)\n\nAbove we have assumed the gravitational action to be the usual Holst action. However, when torsion is present (for\ninstance, when it is generated by fermions or a spacetime-dependent Barbero\u2013Immirzi field [18\u201322]), it is natural to\ninclude it explicitly in the fundamental action, so that the Holst term is completed by a torsion-torsion piece to form\nthe Nieh\u2013Yan invariant [17, 23].\nThere are several other reasons why to prefer the latter alternative. A second motivation is that the Holst term is\nnot topological and vanishes on half-shell, while one would expect to define the theory with topological contributions.\nThird, although mathematically correct the Holst derivation does not respect the usual decomposition of torsion into\nits Lorentz irreducible components, and its trace part (a polar internal vector) turns out to be proportional to the\naxial current [17] [see Eq.

Interestingly enough, such a range of values \u22121 \u226a \u03b5 < 0 may be compatible with\na fractal interpretation of N , where the (early) universe shows an effective dimension slightly smaller than 4. Until\nwe achieve a better control of the quantum theory, the issue of the physical interpretation of N will remain open,\nalthough we have just argued that it admits at least one possible accommodation.\nTo summarize, the effective potential is\n\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0014\n\u0013\n\u0001\n1\n\u22062 \u22062\nM2 2\n(II.45)\nN + + ln \u22062 \u2212 \u03bc2 N + 1 + ln \u22062 .\n\u2206 \u2212 2\nVeff =\n4\n4\u03c0\n4\n2\nAs already mentioned, the bare mass M is O(1) or larger. However, Eq. (II.45) can be obtained also via a different\nregularization procedure which renormalizes the couplings of the theory [6, 24]. This suggests that also M can be\ntreated as a free parameter. It shall be our attitude in what follows.\nIt is clear that the above potential has a minimum at \u2202Veff /\u2202\u2206 = 0 given by the gap equation\nM2 =\n\n\u0003\n\u0001\n1 \u0002 2\n\u2206 (N + 1) \u2212 2\u03bc2 (N + 2) + \u22062 \u2212 2\u03bc2 ln \u22062 .\n2\n2\u03c0\n\n(II.46)\n\nIf M is constant, this equation univocally specifies \u2206 as a spacetime function. It is useful to check that we recover\nthe usual behaviour of the gap in the weak-coupling BCS limit [24, 25], where the fermion gas is diluted. For \u2206 \u226a \u03bc,\nEq.

As soon as we fixed an FLRW\nbackground, we have chosen a \"privileged\" frame whereon one can define a homogeneous number density and a\n\n\f9\nchemical potential. Whenever we refer to these concepts, it is always with respect to this special FLRW homogeneous\ntime slicing. Solutions of the field equations are free to break Lorentz invariance. One can have a chemical potential\nin a Lorentz-invariant Lagrangian, i.e., a term of the form \u03bc\u03bd j \u03bd , while the background \u03bc0 j 0 is aligned in the cosmic\nrest frame. An example is the Kaplan\u2013Nelson model of spontaneous baryogenesis. This is what happens also in big\nbang nucleosynthesis calculations, where one has to include the chemical potential of the different particle species.4\nThis has nothing to do with breaking Lorentz invariance at fundamental level. Here we are assuming, in a selfconsistent manner, that the theory and its false (perturbative) vacuum are indeed Lorentz-invariant, while the true\nvacuum is not when \u03bc 6= 0. We will see that the measurable effect is in the cosmic expansion, and the later one looks\ninto the evolution of the universe, the fewer the Cooper pairs one can detect, thus restoring relativistic physics at late\ntimes.\nThe second comment is the following. We have introduced a physical cutoff by hand as in Minkowski nonrenormalizable theories, but in [12] it was argued that this type of BCS models in curved space may be renormalizable. In\nthe same work, the running of the mass coupling M and a cosmological constant term was considered for a de Sitter\nbackground. Here we shall not endeavour to study the renormalization group flow for the particular, self-consistent\ncosmological background we will find later. However, related to the renormalization issue there is another. Although\nthe tree-level interaction between fermions is attractive, the gravitational interaction could affect renormalization.\nThis is in analogy with the phonon interaction in the standard theory, where the sign of the effective coupling gets\nflipped and one does not generically end up with a condensate [28, 29]. There, one can consider the beta function\nfor the running of the coupling M , and realize that the second-order (four-fermion) phonon-induced interaction is\nattractive (negative coupling) [28]. In our case, the graviton and the torsion are independent degrees of freedom and\nthey can be dealt with separately. An attractive fermion coupling is generated by torsion after integrating it out. We\nmay ask about torsion fluctuations, but they do not take place because torsion is not dynamical. Therefore, so long\nas we have an attractive channel at tree level and a Fermi surface, we will get a nontrivial gap (provided that the\ngap equation has a solution, which it does; see below). As far as torsion is concerned, the attractive nature of the\ntree-level interaction is guaranteed, unlike the phonon-induced screening (or gluon exchange) in typical scenarios. In\nour case, we do not have to worry about a secondary phonon interaction precisely because torsion does not propagate.\nOn the other hand, any screening effect mediated by the graviton will require a separate, detailed assessment.\n\nIII.\n\nCOSMOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS\n\nIn order to obtain the cosmological evolution one has to supplement the gap equation (II.46) and the equation\ndetermining the chemical potential (II.49) with the Friedmann equation\nH2 =\n\n8\u03c0\n(\u03c1gap + \u03c1m ) ,\n3\n\n(III.51)\n\nwhere \u03c1m is any additional matter component. These three expressions (plus the continuity equation for \u03c1m ) determine\nthe evolution of the three unknown quantities \u2206(t), \u03bc(t), a(t). In practice, these transcendental equations are not\nanalytically tractable in their full generality. However, one can solve them in some limiting regimes which can\nqualitatively capture the basic cosmological evolution. We will now focus on these regimes. In the next subsection\nwe will present numerical details.\nThe equation of state for the gap can be defined only implicitly via Eqs. (II.46) and (II.50). We will show that there\nare different regimes where the gap scales effectively as radiation (up to a sign) or a cosmological constant, which\nconfirm the expectation that the gap equation of state must be nonlinear. One can define the gap pressure by taking\nan effective Raychaudhury equation, i.e., by defining the effective barotropic index via\n1 + weff = \u2212\n\n1 d ln |\u03c1gap |\n,\n3 d ln a\n\n(III.52)\n\nas a function of the scale factor. This is what dark energy experiments would measure.\n\n4\n\nIn this context we note that having a nonzero chemical potential implies that we have broken the particle-antiparticle symmetry, which\nin turn breaks local Lorentz invariance regardless of the chosen global metric. Thus we are working on the assumption that some other\nmechanism was responsible for creating the \"initial\" particle-antiparticle asymmetry.\n\n\f10\nA.\n1.\n\nAnalytical treatment\n\nDark radiation (early times)\n\nTo begin with, it is important to see whether the evolution of the gap and the chemical potential at early times\ncan be consistent with the usual matter/radiation dominated decelerating universe. To answer this question, let us\nlook into the limiting case M \u226a |\u03bc|, \u2206 and N \u226b 1 (later we motivate the last condition phenomenologically). The\ngap equation simplifies to\n\u22062 \u2248 2\u03bc2 .\n\n(III.53)\n\nThe energy density of the gap (II.50) becomes\n\u03c1gap \u2248 \u2212\n\n\u0001\n3\u22064\n2N + 3 + 2 ln \u22062 < 0 .\n2\n32\u03c0\n\n(III.54)\n\nOne can also determine the approximate behaviour of the energy density with respect to the scale factor. From\nEq. (II.49), we find that \u03bc must be negative and\n\u0001 n0\n\u22063\n\u221a\nN + 1 + ln \u22062 = 3 ,\na\n2 2\u03c0 2\n\n(III.55)\n\nor approximately (if \u2206 varies slowly)\n\u2206\u223c\n\n1\na\n\n\u21d2\n\n\u03c1gap \u223c \u2212\n\n1\n.\na4\n\n(III.56)\n\nIn other words, the gap energy density behaves approximately as negative radiation.5 This fact was already pointed\nout in [6]. It is also clear that the gap energy density violates the null energy condition6 and this property was\nexploited in [6] to resolve the big bang singularity via a nonsingular bounce, as long as the equation of state of\nordinary matter is w < 1/3.\n2.\n\nde Sitter phase (late times)\n\nIt is relatively easy to see how a late-time de Sitter phase can emerge from the system of cosmological equations.\nIf |\u03bc| \u226a \u2206, the gap equation reduces to (\u03bc < 0 in order to have n > 0)\n\u0001\n2\u03c0 2 M 2 \u2248 \u22062 N + 1 + ln \u22062 ,\n(III.57)\n\nwhile the total energy density is given by\n\n\u03c1gap \u2248\n\n\u0001\n\u22064\n2N + 3 + 2 ln \u22062 .\n2\n32\u03c0\n\n(III.58)\n\nFirst, we observe that the solution to the above equation always has \u03c1gap > 0, and therefore corresponds to a de Sitter\nregime as \u2206 approaches the constant value given by Eq. (III.57). This can be seen by rewriting Eq. (III.58) as\n\u0012 2 2\n\u0013\n\u22064\n4\u03c0 M\n\u03c1gap \u2248\n+1 > 0.\n32\u03c0 2\n\u22062\nWe are specifically interested to see whether we can explain the present dark energy driven acceleration. For this\nwe require (we temporarily restore energy units) \u03c1gap \u223c (meV)4 \u21d2 \u2206 \u223c meV. When can we have such small vacuum\nexpectation value for \u2206? First of all \u2206 \u223c meV corresponds to ln \u22062 \u2248 \u2212140. Since M 2 > 0, (III.57) tells us\nthat N > 140. Further, from (III.57) it is easy to see that there are two different regimes in the parameter space\n(M, N ) when we can get a small vacuum expectation value for \u2206. If M \u223c meV and 140 < N < 103 , the solution\n\n5\n6\n\nA similar contribution appears in braneworld [30] and Ho\u0159ava\u2013Lifshitz [31] cosmologies.\nThis is not very surprising, as it is well known that energy densities associated with vacuum shifts, such as Casimir energies, can indeed\nviolate the energy conditions [32].\n\n\f11\ncorresponds to \u2206 \u223c M \u223c meV. A second possibility is to consider M \u226a meV and N \u223c 140. In this case we have\n\u2206 \u223c e\u2212N/2 \u223c meV. In any case, the relevant range of parameters corresponds to large N and strong-coupling regime,\nN \u226b 1,\n\nM \u226a 1.\n\n(III.59)\n\nAt this point one may be concerned about the tiny value of M that is required to account for dark energy. Indeed,\nnaturalness arguments would suggest M \u223c 1 (Planck scale). We first point out that the M appearing in the effective\npotential (II.45) can be interpreted as a renormalized mass (see [6] for a more detailed discussion), and therefore in\ngeneral it can be different from the bare coupling mass in Eq. (II.10). We shall not study the renormalization group\nflow of this model, and the fact that it is an effective nonrenormalizable model makes it rather difficult to interpret\nthe relation between physical scales and parameters. A much deeper understanding of the quantum field theory giving\nrise to the condensate will be necessary to clarify this point, which will admittedly remain unresolved in this paper.\nWe also mention that there are two other possible explanations for a small coupling M . One is tightly related with\nthe fractal interpretation given below Eq. (II.44). Another is to switch on a strong four-fermion interaction already\nin the Dirac action (II.3), so that the gravity-induced interaction is negligible and M is actually independent from\nthe Planck mass.\nWhatever the interpretation of the four-fermion interaction, and since we have not enough input to predict the\nscale at which condensation takes place, for the time being we must content ourselves to notice that a tiny value of M\nmay be very compelling phenomenologically. In fact, the same gap \u2206 \u223c M may also be able to account for neutrino\noscillations which, as is well known, happen at the same mass scale as dark energy [33].\nThe cosmological evolution of the gap energy is now clear. \"Initially,\" \u2206 \u223c \u03bc \u226b M , and the gap energy behaves as\nnegative dark radiation. Provided the very early universe is dominated by an energy density component which redshifts\nslower than radiation (weff < 1/3), such as during inflation (weff \u2248 \u22121) or a stringy thermal phase (weff \u2248 0) [34\u201338],\nthe negative gap energy ensures the existence of a nonsingular bounce point where the gap energy density precisely\ncancels that of ordinary matter. After the bounce, the gap energy density redshifts away faster than regular matter\nand remains subdominant as compared to ordinary matter/radiation. Thus we can have the usual decelerating phase\nof the standard cosmological model. However, once \u2206 \u223c \u03bc \u223c M , we gradually fall into the constant gap regime\ndiscussed above, where \u2206 \u223c M \u226b \u03bc. Once the matter energy density drops down to \u03c1m \u223c M 4 , we enter the present\ndark energy dominated de Sitter phase.\n\nB.\n\nNumerical Explorations\n\nWe will now verify numerically that we indeed obtain the late-time cosmology discussed above, and, in particular,\nundergo a transition from an early decelerating to a late accelerating phase. To this purpose we define\n\u03c6 \u2261 \u2212 ln \u22062 .\n\n(III.60)\n\n2\u03c0 2 M 2 = e\u2212\u03c6 (N + 1 \u2212 \u03c6) \u2212 2\u03bc2 (N + 2 \u2212 \u03c6) .\n\n(III.61)\n\nThe gap equation becomes\n\nFrom Eq.

By numerically inverting (III.65) we can identify two disconnected branches\nfor \u03c6(a) as depicted in Fig. 1.\n(A) A branch confined within the interval \u2212\u221e < \u03c6 < \u03c6A , where \u03c6A solves the equation N + 1 \u2212 \u03c6A \u2212 2\u03c0 2 e\u03c6A M 2 = 0;\n(B) A branch confined within the interval \u03c6B \u2261 N + 2 < \u03c6 < +\u221e.\nFrom Eq. (II.49), we also observe that while in branch (A) \u03bc < 0, in the (B) branch \u03bc > 0. This suggests that while\nbranch (A) is relevant for strong coupling and BCS condensation, branch (B) describes solutions in the weak-coupling\nregime where the gap is exponentially suppressed with respect to the chemical potential.\nDifferentiating Eq. (III.65) with respect to time, we find\n\u0012\nH = 2+\n\nN +2\u2212\u03c6\n2\n1\n+\n\u2212\nN + 1 \u2212 \u03c6 \u2212 2\u03c0 2 M 2 e\u03c6\nN +1\u2212\u03c6 N +2\u2212\u03c6\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03c6\u0307\n.\n6\n\n(III.66)\n\nThe two branches are separated by a singularity since the Hubble rate diverges as \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6A or \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6B . As \u03c6A <\nN + 1 < \u03c6B , we cannot go from one to the other. Thus, identifying the relevant branch is important for the choice\nof initial conditions, as well as the ensuing cosmology. Figure 1 shows how the branches change with respect to M\nand N : M determines \u03c6A and the increase rate of the scale factor, while N determines only \u03c6A and \u03c6B . This is\nreassuring as the parameter N is arbitrary and its role is just a \u03c6 translation, although its actual value does determine\nthe physical scale of \u03c1gap .\nSince we are interested in the (A) branch with negative chemical potential representing the BCS condensation\nphase, we shall evolve the equations of motion from initial conditions typical of this branch. For the extra matter\ncomponent we consider nonrelativistic dust, for the purpose of illustration. Thus we set \u03c1m = a\u22123 , M = 0 (strong\ncoupling) and N = 0. These values will not correspond to the observed universe but they will capture the qualitative\nfeatures of the dark energy solution.

Numerical late-time solution for M = 0 = N . From left to right and top to bottom: \u03c6(t), gap \u2206(t), chemical potential\n\u03bc(t) and gap energy density \u03c1gap (t). In the last panel the matter contribution (dashed line) is shown for comparison.\n\nthis is because the formation of pairs becomes less and less favorable. Initially \u03c1gap < 0 and the matter contribution\ndominates. The gap density, however, increases in time and eventually (after having changed sign) dominates over\ndust. When this happens we enter the late-time asymptotic de Sitter phase.\nThe evolution of the scale factor and its derivatives is plotted in Fig. 3. At early times the universe is dominated\nby the pressureless matter component \u03c1m and in fact a \u223c t1/\u01eb , where \u01eb \u223c 3(1 + w)/2 \u223c 3/2. As one can see from the\nlast plot, acceleration is triggered when \u03c1gap \u223c \u03c1m but slightly before \u03c1gap > \u03c1m . When radiation is also added, we\nhave checked that the early-time behaviour changes accordingly, \u01eb \u223c 2, but the overall picture remains the same.\nThe effective equation of state of the condensate, Eq. (III.52), is shown in the last panel of Fig. 3. The plot starts\nfrom t = O(10) because, in accordance with Fig. 2, matter dominates before that time. A characteristic prediction\nof this solution, which can be tested by future observations, is that weff < \u22121 and \u1e87eff > 0 at late times. The actual\nvalue of the barotropic index at the onset of the dark energy era will depend on the couplings of the model, which\nwe have not tuned with respect to observations. Since we have a phantomlike regime at intermediate-to-late times,\none should be able to distinguish our model from a pure cosmological constant or quintessence field at high enough\nredshift. The fit with the supernovae data goes beyond the goals of the present investigation.\n\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn this paper we have proposed a mechanism realizing late-time cosmic acceleration due to the possibility that\nfermions can condense in the very early universe. We have shown that all of the necessary conditions for condensation\nexist, including a covariant attractive four-fermion interaction. By analyzing the transcendental equation relating\nthe gap and the scale factor we discovered that at late times the contribution of the gap energy drives a phase of\nacceleration. The details of the model depend on the regularization scheme and the value of the couplings, but the\nemerging qualitative picture is robust.\nIn this context, we note that one may be worried that, given the low value of M required for phenomenology,\nM \u223c meV, our procedure for integrating out gravitational degrees of freedom is not justified, and whether we might\nbe missing corrections of order \u2206/M , which may be important as \u2206/M is not small. Let us reemphasize why the\nmethod we adopted to obtain the effective potential for \u2206 is robust. In the first step, we integrated out the torsion\n\n\f14\n0.35\n25\n0.30\n20\n0.25\na\n\n15\nH 0.20\n10\n0.15\n5\n0.10\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\nt\n\n15\n\n20\n\nt\n\n2.0\n-1.000\n-1.002\n\n1.5\n\n-1.004\n-1.006\n\n\u0395 1.0\n\nweff\n-1.008\n-1.010\n\n0.5\n\n-1.012\n-1.014\n\n0.0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\nt\n\n15\n\n20\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\nt\n\nFIG. 3. Numerical late-time solution for M = 0 = N . From left to right and top to bottom: a(t), Hubble parameter H(t), first\nslow-roll parameter \u01eb(t) and effective barotropic index weff (t) of the condensate equation of state.\n\nfield to obtain a four-fermion interaction. This was done by imposing the classical equations of motion for the\ntorsion field. However, we note crucially that the torsion is a nondynamical field: its field equation is algebraic and\nthere are no derivatives acting on the torsion. In other words, the torsion field does not propagate. If one were to\ndraw Feynman diagrams involving torsion propagators, these would just collapse into points leading to four-fermion\ninteraction vertices. Unlike gauge theories where the four-fermion interaction is only an \"effective\" interaction valid\nbelow the mass of the gauge bosons, the torsion-mediated four-fermion interaction is an exact quantum mechanical\ndescription, because the torsion field has no kinetic term. Therefore the actions given by (II.1) and (II.3) are exactly\nequivalent to (II.10) (plus the usual Einstein\u2013Hilbert and Dirac actions) both classically and quantum mechanically.\nThis equivalence does not depend on how small or large the value of M is.\nIn the next step, we integrated out the fundamental fermionic degrees of freedom to obtain an effective theory of\ntheir bound state, the gap \u2206 (Cooper pairs). The procedure we followed is precisely the same that is adopted in\ncondensed matter literature. In particular, this is known to capture not only the weak-coupling BCS limit (M \u2192 \u221e),\nbut also the strong-coupling BEC limit (Bose\u2013Einstein Condensate, M \u2192 0), which is what we are interested in\n(for general reviews on BEC and the BEC\u2013BCS crossover, see [39\u201343]). We note that the effective potential for \u2206\nfeatures a ln(\u2206/M ) term, which contains all the powers of (\u2206/M ). In this sense, the effective action Seff in Eq. (II.33)\ndescribes nonperturbative phenomena by summing all such terms.\nHaving clarified the nonperturbative character of the condensation, it remains to explain the small value of M ,\nwhich is a partially unrelated question. We have not answered it here but we have commented on several possibilities,\nincluding a renormalization mechanism and the presence ab initio of a strong fermionic interaction. To summarize, one\nis indeed assuming that a bare O(1) cosmological constant \"miraculously cancels\" by virtue of some mechanism. So,\nwe do not solve the \"old cosmological constant problem\" and in this sense fair no better than the usual quintessence\nmodels, where one assumes that all contributions to the effective cosmological constant conspire to reduce it to\na dynamical field with a \"small\" potential. However, our model has some distinct advantages. First, because the\nsuppression of the cosmological constant is exponential, the level of fine-tuning is reduced to just one part over 100, via\nthe choice of N . Therefore, if one could give a physical interpretation to N , then the \"smallness problem\" associated\nwith the observed value of dark energy would be relaxed. This was attempted in Sec. II D. Second, our situation is\nconsistent because we have calculated the nonperturbative potential, whereas in usual quintessence models it is not\nclear why higher-order corrections are suppressed.\n\n\f15\nThere are several issues we have not considered. Since we have worked on the assumption that, like in Minkowski,\nthe fermion interaction is nonrenormalizable, the regularization parameter N of the effective theory has been assumed\nto be physical and therefore should ultimately be motivated by the fundamental microscopic theory. Also, we have\nassumed N to be a constant. A possibility we leave for future study is to allow for a time-varying N (t) or coupling\nM (t). For instance, previous literature [11, 12, 44] have considered different choices for a physical cutoff, \u03bb = \u03bc or\n\u03bb = H, which would correspond to having a time-varying N .7 This may lead to interesting situations, including the\npossibility of not having to tune M to the very tiny meV scale.\nIn order to verify the robustness and observational validity of the rich cosmological picture we presented here,\nfuture studies will have to go into greater detail in the analysis of the parameter space and initial conditions. It is\npromising that the same condensation mechanism can solve the big bang singularity and the dark energy problem.\nWe end by pointing out that the dark energy scenario presented above has some distinctive observational features.\nFor instance, depending upon the detailed history of the early universe the negative dark radiationlike gap energy\nmay be detectable in BBN and CMB observations [51, 52]. Also, there is a most encouraging possibility of linking\nthe scenario with neutrino physics [33], as mentioned earlier.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nS.A. and T.B. are supported by an NSF CAREER grant.
