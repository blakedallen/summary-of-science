Introduction\nA variety of processes have been suggested that might trigger the\nformation of stars, namely large-scale supernova explosions or\nsmaller-scale stellar winds, outflow shocks, or ionization fronts\n(see McKee & Ostriker, 2007; Elmegreen, 1998). Possible triggers are newly formed massive stars, which provide energetic\nfeedback to the interstellar medium (ISM) in the form of expanding Hii regions or strong stellar winds. A recent study of\nthe ubiquitous dust bubbles observed in the mid-infrared (MIR,\n5\u201340 \u03bcm) in the Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey\nExtraordinaire (GLIMPSE; Benjamin et al., 2003) shows that,\ngiven the positional coincidence with known Hii regions, many\nMIR bubbles are indeed produced by hot young stars, and are\nlikely driven by expanding Hii shells (Churchwell et al., 2006;\nWatson et al., 2008). In addition, for reasonable assumptions on\nthe ambient density, the numerical simulations of expanding Hii\nregions carried out by Hosokawa & Inutsuka (2005, 2006) agree\nwith some observations, e.g., Watson et al. (2008).\nThe giant molecular cloud (GMC) associated with the powerful radio continuum source W49A is part of the W49 complex\nwhich also includes the supernova remnant W49B. At a distance\nof 11.4 kpc (Gwinn, Moran, & Reid, 1992), W49A has an infrared luminosity of > 107 L\u2299 and a total mass of \u223c 106 M\u2299\n(Sievers et al., 1991), and contains over a dozen of ultracompact Hii (UC Hii) regions (De Pree, Mehringer, & Goss, 1997;\nDe Pree et al., 2000) as well as the brightest water maser cluster\nin our Galaxy (\u223c1 L\u2299 alone in the 22 GHz line, Genzel et al.,\n1978). The embedded massive stellar cluster found in W49A\nindicates a somewhat more evolved stage of massive star for-\n\nmation in this region (Alves & Homeier, 2003). Many authors\nhave tried to explain why W49A, a Galactic mini-starburst, has\nformed so many massive stars in such a short time. Welch et al.\n(1987) concluded the existence of a large-scale inside-out gravitational collapse based on their interpretation of the HCO+ spectra measured toward the ring-like configuration of UC Hii regions. However, Serabyn, G\u00fcsten, & Schulz (1993) argued that\nthe two components of the double-peak line profile seen in CS\nand C34 S come from different clouds, and suggested that massive star formation in W49A is triggered by a large-scale cloudcloud collision. Recently, it has been argued that one cannot\ndistinguish between a global collapse model of a large cloud\nand a multiple-cloud model, given the existing HCO+ and C18 O\ndata (Williams, Dickel, & Auer, 2004). In this paper, we present\nnew evidence of expanding shells in W49A delineated by dense\nclumps within these shells. The expanding shells provide a natural explanation for the observed molecular line profiles, and\ntriggered massive star formation in W49A.\n\n2. Observations\nObservations of the 13 CO J = 2 \u2212 1 and C18 O J = 2 \u2212 1 transitions toward W49A were carried out in 2006 November and\n2007 November using the IRAM 30 m telescope on Pico Veleta\nin Spain. The focus was checked on Uranus, and the pointing\nwas checked on the strong continuum emission from the BL Lac\nobject 1749+096 and Uranus every hour. The accuracy of the\npointing was \u223c 2\u2032\u2032 \u20133\u2032\u2032 with a telescope tracking accuracy of 1\u2032\u2032 .\nThe chopper wheel method was used to calibrate the data.\n\n\f2\n\nT.-C. Peng et al.: W49A: A starburst triggered by expanding shells\n\nFig. 1. The Spitzer-GLIMPSE IRAC 4.5 \u03bcm and 8.0 \u03bcm images of W49A. Black triangles denote the UC Hii regions observed by\nDe Pree, Mehringer, & Goss (1997). The black dashed ellipses are the suggested expanding shells (shells 1 and 2), and the black\nfilled star represents the center of the expanding shells and gas ejections (see text). The larger black unfilled star represents the\nembedded cluster center according to Alves & Homeier (2003). The white circle in the left image indicates the maximum radius\n(5.3 pc) used in the circular PV diagram shown in Figure 3, and the two white dashed lines represent the linear PV cuts (Fig. 3).\nRed lines and arrows in the right image indicate the directions of gas ejections.\nWe used the HEterodyne Receiver Array, HERA\n(Schuster et al., 2004), to obtain large On-The-Fly (OTF)\nmaps of W49A. HERA is a nine-pixel receiver with dual\npolarizations in a square center-filled 3\u00d73 array, and can be\ntuned to different sky frequencies with different backends\nattached. In particular, simultaneous observations of 13 CO\nJ = 2 \u2212 1 and C18 O J = 2 \u2212 1 are possible. A dewar rotation\nangle of 9.6\u25e6 of HERA was chosen to have Nyquist-sampled\nmaps. Maps sizes of \u223c 4.\u2032 5\u00d74.\u2032 0 were obtained for the 13 CO and\nC18 O J = 2 \u2212 1 lines with an HPBW of \u223c 11\u2032\u2032 . Every scan in\nright ascension was followed by one in declination in order to\nreduce striping patterns. The calibration was done for each OTF\nsubscan and reduced in the MIRA software of the GILDAS1\npackage. OFF scans on the reference position (\u2212600\u2032\u2032 , \u2212600\u2032\u2032 )\nwere done before and after each OTF subscan. The Versatile\nSPectrometer Array (VESPA) was chosen as the backend for\nHERA configured to a bandwidth of 160 MHz for each receiver\nelement and 0.32 km s\u22121 resolution. The data were reduced\nusing the standard procedures in the GILDAS package, and\nwere corrected to main beam temperature T MB units from the\nantenna temperatures T A\u2217 (i.e., T MB = T A\u2217 /\u03b7MB ) which were only\ncorrected for atmospheric absorption, rear spillover, and ohmic\nlosses. The efficiency, \u03b7MB , is given by the ratio between the\nmain beam efficiency (named Beff ; it is 0.51 at 220 GHz in the\nIRAM documentation2), and the forward efficiency Feff (0.91 at\n220 GHz).\n\n1\n2\n\nhttp://www.iram.fr/IRAMFR/GILDAS\nhttp://www.iram.fr/IRAMES\n\n3. Results\nFigure 1 shows evidence of shell structures in W49A in the\n4.5 \u03bcm and 8.0 \u03bcm images from the GLIMPSE archive. They\nwere obtained with the Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC;\nFazio et al., 2004). The 4.5 \u03bcm band, which contains a pure rotational transition of H2 , mainly traces the distribution of warm\nmolecular hydrogen. The 8.0 \u03bcm band, which includes two aromatic infrared features at 7.7 \u03bcm and 8.6 \u03bcm, is believed to be\ndominated by the emission of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon\n(PAH) molecules primarily excited by UV radiation. The angular resolution of IRAC ranges from \u223c 1.\u2032\u2032 5 at 3.6 \u03bcm to \u223c 1.\u2032\u2032 9\nat 8.0 \u03bcm. In two other IRAC bands (3.6 \u03bcm and 5.8 \u03bcm), however, the same structures can also be clearly seen. The shells\nwere first identified by eye and then investigated in the molecular data cube. Two MIR shells have been identified (Fig. 1) with\nlong axes of 55\u2032\u2032 \u201358\u2032\u2032 and short axes of 28\u2032\u2032 \u201335\u2032\u2032 , which implies\nan average size of \u223c 2\u20133 pc in radius. The average thickness of\nthe MIR shells is estimated to be 7.\u2032\u2032 5\u00b11.\u2032\u2032 9 (0.4\u00b10.1 pc) from fits\nof Gaussian profiles to the shells. These two MIR shells lie in the\neast-west and north-south directions, and have a similar size and\nelliptical shape. In addition, they seem to share the same center.\nHowever, it is difficult to identify any similar shell structure\nin the channel maps of the 13 CO and C18 O J = 2 \u2212 1 lines (see\nFig. 2) because of the lower angular resolution and the complexity/clumpiness of the molecular emission. Position-velocity\n(PV) diagrams are thus applied to investigate this shell structure,\nand are used to examine whether a shell appears as an expanding ring/bubble in the molecular line data. Linear PV diagrams\nof 13 CO J = 2 \u22121 and C18 O J = 2 \u22121 are shown in Figure 3, corresponding to the east-west cut (Cut I) and the north-south cut\n\n\fT.-C. Peng et al.: W49A: A starburst triggered by expanding shells\n\n3\n\nFig. 2. The IRAM 30m HERA channel maps of 13 CO J = 2\u22121 (images) overlaid with the C18 O J = 2\u22121 emission in black contours\nwith a resolution of 11\u2032\u2032 . The contours are plotted from 1 to 15 K in steps of 2 K. The white ellipses represent two suggested shells,\nand the white star marks the shell expansion center. The (0\u2032\u2032 , 0\u2032\u2032 ) position is located at the region around source G.\n(Cut II) in Figure 1, where the 13 CO and C18 O counterparts to\nthe proposed two MIR shells are revealed in the PV diagrams. In\naddition, clumps are located along the shells which suggests that\nthey are formed within them. In order to estimate the mass and\nkinematic properties of the shell structure, we constructed a circular PV diagram which azimuthally averages spectra at a given\nradius from the center. The center was chosen to maximize the\nvelocity difference between peaks in the C18 O J = 2 \u2212 1 spectra,\nand is close to the UC Hii regions O and N. Moreover, the circular PV diagram (Fig. 3 c) shows a clear elliptical signature which\nimplies an expanding motion centered on a common origin.\nTherefore, we conclude that the two MIR shells share a common\nexpansion center with an average inner radius of \u2248 2.9 pc (10%\nuncertainty) and an expanding velocity of \u223c 5 km s\u22121 . We can\nreject the possibility that the shells are actually molecular rings\n(Beaumont & Williams, 2009) because two-component spectra\nare seen toward the center of the shells probing their front and\nback sides (Fig. 3). In the LTE assumption, we can estimate the\nH2 column density of the expanding shells from the 13 CO/C18 O\nJ = 2 \u2212 1 ratio, assuming their optical depth ratio is the same as\ntheir abundance ratio. We adopted 12 C/13 C of 46 and 16 O/18 O of\n510 (Wilson & Rood, 1994; Langer & Penzias, 1990) for W49A\n(8.1 kpc to the Galactic center, Gwinn, Moran, & Reid, 1992).\n\nThe excitation temperature of the averaged shell is estimated to\nbe about 25 K. The average H2 column density of the shell is\n\u2248 8.5 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 , excluding the contribution from source G\n(i.e., consider the shell density within a radius of 40\u2032\u2032 in Fig. 3 d).\nAssuming a 10% uncertainty, we calculate an H2 density, n(H2 ),\nof \u2248 6.7\u00b12.1\u00d7103 cm\u22123 in a spherical structure with a filling factor of 1 and a CO abundance of 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 (e.g., Lacy et al., 1994).\nThe shell mass (Msh ) can be estimated as 1.9 \u00b1 0.7 \u00d7 104 M\u2299 .\n2\nThen the kinetic energy ( 21 Msh Vsh\n) and the momentum (Msh Vsh )\ncan be computed to be 4.6 \u00b1 3.0 \u00d7 1048 erg and 9.3 \u00b1 4.0 \u00d7 104\nM\u2299 km s\u22121 , respectively, assuming a 20% uncertainty in the expansion speed measurement.\n\n4. Discussion\n4.1. Driving mechanisms for the expanding shells\n\nThe reason for the elliptical shape of the two shells is not clear,\nbut is probably due to different expansion velocities in the two\naxes, or due to multiple expanding events. In the interstellar bubble model of Weaver et al. (1977), where the spherical expanding shells are driven by winds, the age of an averaged expanding\nshell in W49A can be estimated as 3.4 \u00b1 0.4 \u00d7 105 yr from the\n\n\f4\n\nT.-C.

Here, the radius of\nthe shell depends on the mass-loss rate \u1e40 of the driving source\n(Weaver et al., 1977)\n!3/5\n!1/5 \u0012\n\u0116\nt\n\u03bc n0 \u0013\u22121/5\nRsh (t) = 28.1\npc,(1)\n1 cm\u22123\n1036 erg s\u22121\n106 yr\nwhere \u0116 is the mechanical luminosity (\u0116 = 12 \u1e40w Vw2 ), and n0\nis the ambient H density. We derived an average H2 density of\n\u223c 2 \u00d7 103 cm\u22123 in W49A by using the 13 CO/C18 O J = 2 \u2212 1\nratio mentioned above, and we adopted an ambient density n0\nof 4 \u00d7 103 cm\u22123 and a stellar wind velocity Vw of 2000 km s\u22121 .\nHence, a constant mass-loss rate of \u223c 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22126 M\u2299 yr\u22121 is\nneeded to sustain a wind-driven bubble in a size of \u223c 2.9 pc,\nwhich corresponds to the mass loss rate of one O-type star. In\naddition, about 20% of the wind energy is channeled into the kinetic energy of the swept-up shell (Weaver et al., 1977), which\nmeans that a total energy of \u2248 3.4 \u00b1 2.2 \u00d7 1048 erg is provided\nby winds during the expansion. This is consistent with the average shell kinetic energy of 4.6 \u00b1 3.0 \u00d7 1048 erg. However, given\n\nthe elliptical shape of the two shells, their expansion likely differs from that of the interstellar bubble model discussed above.\nTherefore, a reasonable upper-limit of the shell age (t \u2264 RVshsh ) is\nestimated to be 5.7 \u00b1 1.3 \u00d7 105 yr, assuming either a monotonically decreasing expansion velocity or a constant velocity. We\nconclude that the ages of these expanding shells are likely about\n3\u20137 \u00d7 105 yr.\nOn the other hand, a high radiation pressure in Hii regions\ncan also provide enough energy to drive an expanding shell (e.g.,\nKrumholz & Matzner, 2009). Homeier & Alves (2005) estimate\na cluster mass of \u223c 1 \u00d7 104 M\u2299 around source O and source\nN by summing 54 stars with masses greater than 20 M\u2299 within\n2.5 pc, which means that this cluster probably hosts \u223c 30\u201350\nO6 stars with an ionization luminosity Q of \u223c 1 \u00d7 1051 s\u22121\n(Vacca, Garmany, & Shull, 1996). This corresponds to a luminosity L of 8 \u00d7 1040 erg s\u22121 . The luminosity (L = Psh c/t) needed\nfor energy-driven shells can be estimated to be \u223c 8 \u00d7 1039 erg\ns\u22121 , assuming no photon leaking. Therefore, no matter whether\nthe expanding shells are driven by winds or by radiation pres-\n\n\fT.-C. Peng et al.: W49A: A starburst triggered by expanding shells\n\n5\n\nFig. 4.

The violet curves in a double-cone shape represent the gas ejections in the NW-SE direction,\nand the red dashed line represents the NE-SW direction of the bipolar gas ejections. The contours denote the temperatures from 0.4\nto 4.8 K in steps of 0.4 K.\nsure, just a few massive stars can account for the driving energy rather than the whole cluster. A recent model of W49A\nby Murray, Quataert, & Thompson (2010) demonstrated that the\ndominating radiation pressure from a new born cluster forms a\nbubble which eventually disrupts the whole cloud. In their onedimensional model, the outward force is dominated by the force\nfrom protostellar jets during the first 3 \u00d7 105 yr, and radiation\npressure dominates until the first supernova explodes. However,\nin the early phases, the expanding shell is driven by protostellar\njets in their model, and it is not clear how those jets can drive\nthe shells in W49A. Furthermore, leaking photons may reduce\nthe radiation force on the shell. It is possible that many of the\nembedded sources seen by Homeier & Alves (2005) are stars\nformed after shell fragmentation. We suspect in fact that these\ntwo shells originate from a common center, which is close to the\nembedded cluster center indicated by Homeier & Alves (2005),\nand trigger star formation later when expanding.\n\n4.2. Fragmentation of the shells\n\nAccording to Whitworth et al. (1994), an expanding shell begins\nto fragment at tfragment \u223c (G\u03c1o M)\u22121/2 , depending on the ambient density \u03c10 and the shell Mach number M. The time scale\nfor fragmentation, tfragment , is shorter than the time scale needed\nfor the shell to become dominated by self-gravity, tgravity \u223c\n(G\u03c1sh )\u22121/2 . The value of tfragment is estimated to be \u2248 3.6 \u00d7 105 yr,\nwith a sound speed CH2 of 0.35 km s\u22121 and a Mach number of\nabout 14 inside the shell. The time scale for the shells in W49A\nto fragment into clumps and further collapse to form new stars is\nabout a few times 105 yr, which roughly corresponds to the time\nscale of massive star formation (Zinnecker & Yorke, 2007). The\nclumps formed after fragmentation are well separated as shown\nin Figure 3, and the two velocity components at \u223c 4 km s\u22121 and\n\u223c 12 km s\u22121 toward the region around source G are perhaps two\nclumps along the line of sight.\n\n\f6\n\nT.-C. Peng et al.: W49A: A starburst triggered by expanding shells\n\n4.3. Large-scale gas ejections\n\nA recent paper by Matthews et al. (2009) reveals the distribution of dust clumps in the large-scale environment of the\nW49 complex, including one UC Hii region G43.24\u20130.05\n(Kurtz, Churchwell, & Wood, 1994) and one hydroxyl maser\nsource OH43.13+0.04 (Becker, White, & Proctor, 1992). Many\ndust clumps are aligned toward the region near source O and\nsource N, which are close to the center of our expanding\nshells (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the PV diagrams derived using the\nGalactic Ring Survey (GRS; Jackson et al., 2006) 13 CO J = 1\u22120\nemission show an \"outflow structure\" which may be related to\nthe expanding shells. For example, the PV diagram of Cut IV\nshown in Figure 4 indicates a bipolar outflow between G43.24\u2013\n0.05 and OH 43.13+0.04 with the center of the expanding shell\nstructure located roughly symmetrically between the two clumps\nseen in mm emission. Other evidence is the detection of UC\nHii regions (Fig. 4) toward the shell expansion center as well\nas the fact that the filaments seen in 13 CO J = 2 \u2212 1 have a\nradial geometry relative to the shell expansion center (although\nthose filaments may be also related to W49A North or source\nG). Still further evidence of gas ejections comes from a largescale gas distribution in the NW-SE direction suggesting that\nwidely-distributed molecular gas and UC Hii regions are present\ntogether with the double-cone structure shown in Figure 4 (III).\nWithout taking the inclination into account, we can estimate the projected kinetic energy (as a lower-limit) of the NESW gas ejections by assuming that they occurred at the same\ntime when the shells started expanding (i.e., 5.7 \u00d7 105 yr as\nan upper-limit) and by adopting the clump mass estimates of\nMatthews et al. (2009). In the northeastern ejection, the clumps\nG43.24\u20130.05 and G43.224\u20130.038 have a total projected kinetic energy of 1.3 \u00b1 0.6 \u00d7 1050 erg; in the southwestern ejection, W49A Southwest, OH43.13+0.04, submillimeter sources\nG43.108+0.044 and G43.099\u20130.050 have a total projected kinetic energy of 1.1 \u00b1 0.3 \u00d7 1050 erg, assuming a 20% uncertainty in the mass measurements. The projected kinetic energy\nestimates are summarized in Table 1. The projected kinetic energy for both directions is roughly equal, and we infer a total\nprojected kinetic energy of 2.4 \u00b1 0.7 \u00d7 1050 erg. This result depends on our assumption about the age of the outflows. If the\ngas ejection time scale were seven times longer than the age of\nexpanding shells, the kinetic energy for the shells and the outflows would be similar. In either case, the total energy released\nby shell expansion and gas ejection has a magnitude of 1050 erg.\nSince we only estimated the kinetic energy for the NE-SW gas\nejection, the total kinetic energy of the gas ejection event in the\nW49 complex may be larger. It is worth noting that G43.24\u2013\n0.05 is located at a similar distance (11.7+0.8\n\u22120.7 kpc; Watson et al.,\n2003) as W49A, and probably hosts a newly born star producing the UC Hii region. In addition, the nearby source G43.2240.038 is likely related to G43.24\u20130.05. The nature of the OH\nmaser source OH43.13+0.04 is not clear, since it is not associated with any of the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS)\nsources (Becker, White, & Proctor, 1992). Additionally, the nature of the submm sources G43.108+0.044 and G43.009+0.050\nare also unknown.\nThe magnetic field measurement by Brogan & Troland\n(2001) shows a gradient in the line-of-sight component of the\nmagnetic field, Blos , in the NE-SW direction crossing the expansion center, where a very weak Blos is derived from the 7 km s\u22121\nHi component. For a radially increasing magnetic field, a weak\nBlos is expected in the shell expansion center (VLSR \u223c 7\u20138 km\ns\u22121 ). The fact that Blos increases in the northeastern and south-\n\nTable 1.

In addition, another strong Blos peak in the\nnorthwestern direction at 4 km s\u22121 could be related to the NWSE gas ejection with a double-cone shape. It is not clear what\nkind of event can cause large-scale gas ejections with a kinetic\nenergy of a few times 1050 erg. A supernova explosion is unlikely since such an explosion would destroy the whole cloud\nwith a kinetic energy of \u223c 1051 erg. A stellar merger of two 30\nM\u2299 stars can release a kinetic energy as high as \u223c 2 \u00d7 1050 erg\n(Bally & Zinnecker, 2005). However, there is no evidence for\nsuch an event, and it may be impossible to find conclusive evidence. Thus, understanding the driving source requires examining the region around the shell expansion center in detail.\n\n5. Conclusions\nThe morphology of the molecular line emission and the associated velocity signatures are consistent with the shell structure seen in the GLIMPSE images. The expanding shells in\nW49A are suggestive of triggered massive star formation in just\n\u223c 105 yr. There is evidence for dense clumps coincident with\nthe shells, and the two velocity components toward the region\naround source G may be two distinct clumps along the line of\nsight. The expanding shells are likely to have a common origin\nclose to source O with an expansion speed of \u223c 5 km s\u22121 and\nan age of 3\u20137 \u00d7 105 years. However, it is not clear what is the\ndriving mechanism of the shell expansion. The average mass of\nthe expanding shells is \u223c 2 \u00d7 104 M\u2299 with a kinetic energy of\n\u223c 1049 erg, which is probably powered by a few massive stars\nin the center of the cluster, and the expanding shells are either\ndriven by strong winds or by radiation pressure. In addition, evidence of the gas ejections is present in the large-scale GRS 13 CO\nJ = 1\u22120 and dust continuum data. Both ejections appear to have\nthe same origin as the expanding shells with a total energy of a\nfew times 1050 erg. The properties of the central source driving\nthe expanding shells and gas ejections need further investigation.\nAcknowledgements.
