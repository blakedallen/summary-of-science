Another reason is that the\ntopological property is more robust than the magnetic\nor the superconducting properties against systematical\nerrors in the first-principle calculations. Study the interplay of the correlation effect and the topological order is interesting from both fundamental and application\npoints of view. Interacting effect on topological phases\nalready received many attentions recently. Various analytical or numerical tools have been applied to several\nmodels for topological insulators[6\u201310]. However, most of\nthese studies used the conventional non-topological quantities such as the long range order parameter[11], the excitation gap[8, 12] etc to indirectly characterize the interacting topological phases. How to extract the interacting\ntopological index from many-body calculations remains\nto be a challenge.\nThere are indeed some progresses along this line. For\nChern TI, the quantum Hall conductance can be calculated using the twisted-boundary-condition [13] or the\nlinear response formula[9]. For Z2 TI, Ref.[14] suggested\na definition of interacting Z2 index based on the singleparticle Green's function:\n\nZ2 =\n\n\u03c02\n\u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3\u03c4 Tr\n15\n\nZ\n\nd4 kd\u03c9\n(2\u03c0)5\n\nG\u2202\u03bc G\u22121 G\u2202\u03bd G\u22121 G\u2202\u03c1 G\u22121 G\u2202\u03c3 G\u22121 G\u2202\u03c4 G\u22121 (1)\nwhere G(k, i\u03c9) is Matsubara Green's function [31],\n\u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3\u03c4 is the five-order anti-symmetric tensor, \u03bc, \u03bd...\u03c4\nindices denote the frequency-momenta (\u03c9, kx , ky , kz , k\u03bb ).\nFor three (two) dimensional topological insulator, one\n(two) of them is pumping parameter extending the momenta to four dimensions [14]. Note the difference of\nEqn.1 with quantum (spin) Hall conductivity coefficient\n[9]. Since the formula contains the five-dimensional\nfrequency-momenta integration and here the conservation of spin quantum number is not assumed, hence\n\n[\n\nZ2\n\nH0 + H 1\n\n]= Z [\n2\n\nH0\nNoninteracting bath\n\n]\n\nFIG. 1: Illustration of strategy for calculating the interacting\nZ2 index. Z2 index of an interacting system equals to Z2 index\nof a noninteracting auxiliary system [1]. The auxiliary system\nis constructed such that its noninteracting bath mimics the\neffect of local self-energy due to the interaction H1 . See text\nfor details on how to construct the auxiliary system.\n\nGreen's function is in general a matrix in spin-orbital\nspace. Although being very general, introducing of\npumping parameter and invoking of derivatives with respect to frequency-momenta hinder precise numerical implementation of Eqn.1.\nThere are some attempts of integrating Eqn.1 numerically for typical forms of interacting Green's functions\n[15]. It is highly desirable to have a recipe for extracting\ntopological informations for Z2 TI. It would be even more\nuseful if the method can be easily combined with the first\nprinciple approaches. This will accelerate the search for\ncorrelated topological materials.\nIn this Letter, we propose a numerical scheme of calculating interacting Z2 index in Eqn.1. It is based on the\npole-expansion form of the local self-energy [1]. With interacting Z2 index we study an interaction induced topological phase transition and nontrivial topological phases\nin interacting Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model[16].\nAs shown in Ref.[1], when the self-energy is local (kindependent), the Z2 index of an interacting system is\nidentical to that of an auxiliary noninteracting system.\nThe auxiliary system is constructed through the poleexpansion technique. The idea of pole-expansion is illustrated in Fig.1. We are interested in the topological properties of an interacting system with Hamiltonian\nH0 + H1 , where H0 is single-particle part, H1 describes\nthe local interactions. Suppose effect of the local interaction imprints some local self-energy to the system. One\n\n\f2\ncan construct an auxiliary noninteracting system by coupling noninteracting baths to H0 . Integrating out the\nbath sites gives identical self-energy due to the local interaction H1 . Pole-expansion of the local self-energy is an\nefficient way of determining the bath levels. Most importantly, Ref.[1] proves that the Z2 index of the noninteracting system is identical to the Z2 index of the original\ninteracting system. This greatly simplifies the study of\nthe topological properties of interacting insulators. Note\nthat this formalism does not require the system holds\ninversion symmetry.\nModel and Methods\u2013We study interacting effect on\nBHZ model, one of the early non-interacting models showing the Z2 topological order[16].\nThe\nP \u2020\n\u2020\nHamiltonian reads H0 =\n\u03c8\nH\n\u03c8\n,\nwith\n\u03c8\nk k k k\nk =\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n(csk\u2191 , cpk\u2191 , csk\u2193 , cpk\u2193 ),\n\u0012\nHk =\n\n\u0012\nHk =\n\n\u0013\n\nHk\n\n(2)\n\n\u2217\nH\u2212k\n\nM(k)\n\u03bb(sin kx \u2212 i sin ky )\n\u03bb(sin kx + i sin ky )\n\u2212M(k)\n\n\u0013\n(3)\n\ncorrelation and has the advantage of giving us direct access to pole structure of Green's function. We employing\nLanczos method [19] to solve ground state and Green's\nfunction. With ground state |gi of AIM, we run Lanczos algorithm starting from c\u2020\u03b2 |gi (c\u03b1 |gi) to get a set of\neigenpairs {En , |ni} ({Em , |mi}) for adding (removing)\none particle subspace (\u03b1, \u03b2 denote combined spin-orbital\nindex \u03b1 = {s(p), \u03c3}) . Local Green's function is calculated as:\n\nG\u03b1\u03b2 (z) =\n\nn\n\nX\nUX\n(nsi\u03c3 +npi\u03c3 ) (4)\n(nsi\u2191 nsi\u2193 +npi\u2191 npi\u2193 )\u2212\n2 i\u03c3\ni\n\nIn the following discussion, we focus on m = \u22123 and\n\u03bb = 0.3. Chemical potential term ensures that the whole\nsystem has particle-hole symmetry and on average there\nare two particles per site.\nFor U = 0 the system lies in the normal band insulator\nregion. s and p orbitals are well separated. Occupation\nof the two orbitals are (2\u2212 , 0+ ), small deviation is due\nto hybridizations. With increasing U , some of elections\nreside on s-orbital will be pushed to p -orbital. Occupation number of each orbital will approach to (1+ , 1\u2212 )\nat large U . In following calculations, spin symmetry\nis conserved, where we have hns\u2191 i = hns\u2193 i \u2261 hns i and\nhnp\u2191 i = hnp\u2193 i \u2261 hnp i .\nWe perform the dynamical-mean-field-theory (DMFT)\n[18] calculations for interacting BHZ model. By solving the two-orbital Anderson impurity model (AIM) selfconsistently, DMFT gives a good approximation of the\nlocal Green's function and self-energy. Here, the AIM is\nsolved with Lanczos exact diagonalization (ED) impurity\nsolver [32].

Rewrite Eqn.5 to G\u03b1 (z) = i=1\nz\u2212Qi\u03b1 , we have\ndirect access to poles and weights of local Green's function {Qi\u03b1 , W\u03b1i }. Number of poles NG are limited by basis size as well as number of Lanczos vectors. We have\nchecked that finial Z2 index does not change as we include more Lanczos vectors. We then get pole-expansion\nPNG \u22121 V\u03b1i\nof local self-energy \u03a3\u03b1 (z) = \u03a3\u03b1 (\u221e)+ i=1\nz\u2212P\u03b1i follow\nRef.[20], with\n\nand M(k) = m + cos kx + cos ky .

Noninteracting BHZ model is in Z2 topological phase for\n\u22122 < m < 2 (except m = 0 the gap closes)[17].\nWe introduce intra-orbital repulsion H1 , and study its\neffect on the topological properties of BHZ model.\nH1 = U\n\nX hg|c\u03b1 |nihn|c\u2020\u03b2 |gi\n\nNG\nX\n\n\u03a3\u03b1 (\u221e) =\n\nW\u03b1i Qi\u03b1\n\n(6)\n\n=0\n\n(7)\n\ni\nNG\nX\n\nW\u03b1i\n\nj\ni=1 P\u03b1\n\nV\u03b1j\n\n=\n\n\"N\nG\nX\ni=1\n\n\u2212 Qi\u03b1\n\nW\u03b1i\n(P\u03b1j \u2212 Qi\u03b1 )2\n\n#\u22121\n(8)\n\nWe explicitly check that the self-energies constructed\nin this way agree with the self-energies obtained\ndirectly from the Dyson equation, see Fig.3 [33].\nWith {\u03a3\u03b1 (\u221e), P\u03b1i , V\u03b1i } we construct the noninteracting\npseudo-Hamiltonian according to [1, 21]:\n\uf8eb\n\np\np\nNG \u22121\n1\nHk + diag(\u03a3\n)\n\u03b1 (\u221e)) diag( V\u03b1 ) . . . diag( V\u03b1\np\n\uf8ec\n1\n1\nV\ndiag(\n)\ndiag(P\n)\n\uf8ec\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nH\u0303k = \uf8ec\n..\n..\n\uf8ec\n.\n\uf8ed\np.\nNG \u22121\n)\ndiag(P\u03b1NG \u22121 )\ndiag( V\u03b1\nZ2 index of H\u0303k is calculated using algorithm for noninteracting systems [22].

Z2 index\nin HF treatment is inferred from value of meff . In DMFT\ntreatment, Z2 index is calculated with information on poles\nof the local self-energies. It is also consistent with the edge\nspectra, see Fig.4\n\nU (hn i\u2212hn i)\n\ns\np\n\u03a3\u03b1 (\u221e) =\nI2 \u2297 \u03c3 z . It renormalizes parame2\nter m in H0 to meff = m + U (hns i \u2212 hnp i)/2. In Fig.2\nwe plot the effective mass as a function of U . It can be\nseen that the topological phase transition occurs whenever meff exceeds \u22122. Topological transition occurs due\nto interaction induced relative level shift of s and p orbitals, which drives the system into an effective inverted\nband region.\nEffective mass shows non-monotonous behavior for\nlarger U . This is due to the fact that in the large U\nlimit fillings of s and p orbital tend to be evened out to\n(1+ , 1\u2212 ). Since hns i \u2212 hnp i decays faster then 1/U , meff\nturns back to the non-interacting value m (see following).\nInterestingly, the interacting Z2 index calculated in this\nregion disassociates with effective mass. The system is\nalways shows nontrivial topological property even as meff\ngoes back to its noninteracting value. However, simple\nconsideration based solely on effective mass would predict\na trivial phase in this region. Above analysis shows that\ndynamical part of self-energy is important in determining the topological properties in a correlated topological\ninsulator.\nWe further calculate edge spectrum A(kx , \u03c9) by projecting the interaction Green's function on to the open\nedges [34]. In Fig.4(a-c), edge states are in accordance\nwith Z2 index calculated from pole-expansions (TI phase\nfor U > 2.2). Inside TI phase, bulk gap first increases\n(due to band inversion) then shrinks (due to correlation\neffect) with increasing U . Since the bulk gap never closes\nafter the first transition at U = 2.2, it is expected that the\ntopological index is unchanged.

Physically, this tiny gapped TI phase corresponds to a state\nproximate to Mott transition with a tiny quasi-particle\nweight. Due to the presence of crystal field splitting, the\nsystem does not reach to the case with hns i = hnp i = 1,\nthus preventing the Mott transition to happen. As long\nas there is a finite quasi-particle weight, the system is\ntopological nontrivial. Reduction of the bulk gap for a\ncorrelated insulator is also observed in [7, 23].\nAs a comparison, we solve interacting BHZ model\nwith the Hartree-Fock (HF) mean-field theory.\nIn\nHFPtreatment, interacting term is decoupled as H1 =\nU i\u03c3 (ns\u03c3 hns\u03c3\u0304 i + np\u03c3 hnp\u03c3\u0304 i). This also effectively modifies the mass term to meff = m + U (hns i \u2212 hnp i)/2. By\nsolving the mean-field Hamiltonian self-consistently we\nfind that meff increases monotonously with U . In Fig.2,\nwe see effective mass from DMFT and HF calculations\nare in accordance with each other for small interacting\nstrength U < 2. Interaction driven band inversion is\ncaptured by a Hatree-Fock level shift. However HF result\ndeviates from DMFT one at large U . This is because that\nthe HF theory does not correctly capture the asymptotic\nbehavior of hns i \u2212 hnp i at large U [35]. Due to this, we\nanticipate that HF will favor the existence of topological\nphase transitions in some strongly correlated materials.\nIn HF treatment, topological properties is simply determined by the mean-field Hamiltonian, i.e., the meanfield Z2 index comes from meff . The topological transition occurs whenever meff exceeds \u22122. Topological\ntransition point in HF theory shifts towards (slightly)\nsmaller value of U compared to the DMFT result. At\nthe phase boundary, the single-particle excitation gap\n\n\f4\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nFIG. 4: Edge spectra for different interacting strengths.\nAcross the topological transition point the edge state develops. Edge spectrum for U = 8.0 still shows edge state crossing\nthe fermi surface, indicating a nontrivial correlated TI phase.\nWe show different frequency regions for U = 2.0, 2.2, 2.4,\n\u03c9 \u2208 [\u22122.4, 2.4] and for U = 8.0, \u03c9 \u2208 [\u22120.48, 0.48], respectively.\n\ncloses and the effective mass shows a kink in the transition point[10, 24].\nTo summarize our physical result: the mean-field effect\nfirst drives the band inversion and turns the system into a\ncorrelated TI. Further increasing U will first stabilize the\nTI phase by a larger band inversion, but soon correlation\neffect takes over to suppress the quasi-particle weight and\nhence the bulk gap. The system is academically always\nin the TI phase with a tiny gap since there is no Mott\ntransition.\nDiscussion\u2013We have applied several ways to determine the topological properties of an interacting model,\nnamely getting the interacting Z2 index from poleexpansion, looking at the edge spectrum and using the\nmean-field theory. The mean-field theory is not reliable\nfor strongly correlated systems. Practically, the edge\nspectrum (real frequency) is not directly accessible to\nmany numerical techniques due to the complication of\nanalytical continuation. And it is hard to distinguish odd\nand even pairs of edge states from the spectrum. The interacting Z2 index Eqn.1 is defined using the Matsubara\nGreen's function. However, as discussed in [1, 15] due to\nextremely inhomogeneity distribution of the integrand, it\nis hard to directly accomplish the integration to get quan-\n\ntized topological index. Pole expansion technique, combined with DMFT calculations, thus provides a practical\nway of determining the topological properties of correlated topological insulators. Since pole-expansion technique is already widely used in LDA+DMFT calculations\n(for avoiding time consuming numerical inverse)[20, 21],\nwith the proof-of-principle demonstration here, we anticipate that the combination of present approach with\nthe ab initio tools will be useful for future theoretical\nsearching of correlated TI materials.\nSummary\u2013 For parameter region studied in the present\npaper, the topological phase transition is essentially\ndriven by mean-field effect (shift of HF levels). However,\ndeep inside the interacting TI phase, correlation effect\nplays an important role in modifying the properties of the\nsystem. Mean-field theory fails in prediction of topological nature base on the orbital occupations. On the other\nhand, the interacting Z2 index from the pole-expansion\ncorrectly predicts a topological nature of the correlated\nTI phase for whole range of interacting strength. This is\nquite remarkable, because we do not need to consult to\ndynamical quantities (like the edge spectrum or the realfrequency Green's function) to determine the topological\nnature of an interacting system.\nNote\u2013 After completion of this manuscript, there appear interesting papers by Wang [25, 26]. We have validated their formula with our numerical Green's functions\n[36]. It gives identical topological transition point as the\npole-expansion method used in this paper. Independent\nstudies are also reported in [27] and [28].\nAcknowledgment\u2013 This work is supported by NSFChina and National Basic Research Program of China\n(No.2009CB92102).

At each step we\ndetermine energy level and coupling strength of bath sites\nto the impurity site from center of mass of and weight of\nhybridization function.\n[33] Different from Ref.[20] where they employ Hubbard-I\nsolver, here we need to further exclude poles and corresponding weights from hybridization with bath sites.\nThis can be easily done since we have discrete bath sites\nin ED solver, whose hybridization function is known.\n[34] When calculating edge spectrum, we assume self-energy\non the edge are the same with bulk, this is of course a\ncrude approximation. It would be interesting to study\nposition dependent (although local) self-energies in the\nformalism of real-space DMFT[29, 30].\n[35] A simple estimation based on two-level model shows that\nhns i \u2212 hnp i \u223c 1/U 3 , however, HF predicts hns i \u2212 hnp i \u223c\n1/U .\n[36] We diagonalize G(ki , 0) = [\u2212Hk \u2212 \u03a3(ki , 0)]\u22121 for ki \u2208\nTRIM points. Denote eigenvectors with positive eigenvalues as |\u03b1i i. They are also eigenvectors of parity operator P\nP = diag(1, 1, \u22121, \u22121), i.e. P |\u03b1i i = \u03b7\u03b1i |\u03b1i i.
