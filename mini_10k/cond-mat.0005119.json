The Bose metal is stable\nto weak disorder and hence represents a concrete example of an interaction-induced metallic phase. Phenomenological inclusion of dissipation reinstates the anticipated insulating behaviour in the quantumdisordered regime. Hence, we conclude that the traditionally-studied insulator-superconductor transition, which is driven solely by quantum fluctuations, corresponds to a superconductor-metal transition.\nThe possible relationship to experiments on superconducting thin films in which a low-temperature\nmetallic phase has been observed is discussed.\n\nTwo ground states are thought to exist for bosons at\nT = 0: a superconductor with long-range phase coherence and an insulator in which the quantum mechanical\nphase is disordered. In this paper, we prove that the\nphase-disordered regime is actually not an insulator but\nrather a metal with a universal conductivity given by\n(2/\u03c0)4e2 /h. This result arises from a conspiracy: In the\nquantum-disordered regime, the population of bosons is\nexponentially suppressed; however, so is the scattering\nrate between bosons. But because the conductivity is\na product of the density and the scattering time, the\nexponentials cancel, giving rise to a finite conductivity\nat T = 0. Any finite amount of dissipation, however,\nreinstates the insulator. Consequently, the traditional\narguments for the insulating phase of bosons based on\nquantum fluctuations of the phase must be reconsidered.\nQuantum fluctuations alone are insufficient to yield an\ninsulating phase as illustrated clearly in Fig. (1). Generically, quantum fluctuations lead to a Bose metal phase\nin 2D.\nTo establish our result, we rely on the LandauGinzburg formalism. While this approach has had much\nsuccess [1,2,4\u201312] in elucidating the critical properties of\nthin films and Josephson junction arrays at the point\nof transition [4,13], the transport properties have proven\nto be more elusive. For example, simple physical considerations [2,3] place the conductivity at the point of\ntransition at a universal value of \u03c3Q = 4e2 /h, whereas\nin experiments, \u03c3Q ranges anywhere from 2\u03c3Q to \u03c3Q /3\n[14\u201316]. Likewise, theoretical calculations based on the\nLandau-Ginsburg approach have yielded values ranging\nfrom \u03c0\u03c3Q /8 [11,12] to 1.037\u03c3Q [17]. In addition, Damle\nand Sachdev [17] have shown that the frequency and temperature tending to zero limits do not commute. The\nlack of commutativity of these two limits arises from the\nfundamental fact that close to the transition point, the\nconductivity is a universal function of h\u0304\u03c9/T [17]. Consequently, \u03c3(\u03c9 \u2192 0, T = 0) 6= \u03c3(\u03c9 = 0, T \u2192 0). The orig-\n\ninal theoretical work [2,12] was all based on the former\nlimit which physically represents the coherent regime.\n\nT\nTKT\nQC\nSC\n\nBose\nMetal\n\ng\n\nc\n\ng= E c /J\n\nFIG. 1. Phase diagram for the superconductor-Bose metal\ntransition as a function of temperature and the quantum fluctuations, g. For Josephson-junction arrays, g is given by the\nratio of the charging energy, Ec , to the Josephson coupling,\nJ. TKT is the Kosterlitz-Thouless temperature at which phase\ncoherence obtains. gc defines the critical value of the phase\ndisorder to destroy the superconducting phase. QC refers to\nthe quantum critical regime in which the inverse correlation\nlength is linear in the temperature.\n\nIn such calculations, the dc-conductivity acquires a singular Drude part on the insulating side which can be\nregularized by the phenomenological inclusion of dissipation [11,18]. Experimentally, however, it is \u03c3(\u03c9 =\n0, T \u2192 0), or equivalently the hydrodynamic regime,\nthat is relevant. In this regime, collisions between quasiparticles dominates the conductivity which can be obtained from the quantum kinetic equation. While such\nan approach has been used in the quantum critical\n1\n\n\f[\u03b4f (k)(n(\u01ebq+k \u2212 \u01ebk ) \u2212 n(\u01ebq ))\n\nregime, no corresponding study has been made in the\nquantum-disordered regime. It is precisely this limit\nthat we study here using the quantum kinetic approach.\nWe show explicitly that the quartic interaction between\nthe bosons, whose dispersion relation is gapped in the\nphase-disordered regime, ultimately gives rise to a metallic rather than the anticipated insulating phase in the\nquantum-disordered regime. The Bose metal that we find\nis distinct from the Bose metal of Das and Doniach [19]\nwhich is purported to obtain once the size of the Josephson superconducting grains exceeds a critical value. Further, our result establishes that the Bose metal is the\ngeneric ground state of bosons lacking phase coherence\nin the absence of dissipation.\nAlthough our microscopic system is an array of Josephson junctions, we coarse-grain over the phase associated\nwith each junction and hence use as our starting point\nthe Landau-Ginzburg action,\nX\nF [\u03c8] =\n(k 2 + \u03c9n2 + m2 )|\u03c8(k, \u03c9n )|2\n\n\u2212\u03b4f (q + k)(1 + n(\u01ebk ) + n(\u01ebq+k \u2212 \u01ebk ))]\nZ\n1\n1\nIm\nd2 q\n+\n\u01ebq+k \u01ebk \u03a0(q, \u01ebk \u2212 \u01ebq+k )\n\u01ebq+k <\u01ebk\n\u00d7 [\u03b4f (k)(1 + n(\u01ebq ) + n(\u01ebk \u2212 \u01ebq+k ))\n\n+\u03b4f (q + k)(n(\u01ebk ) \u2212 n(\u01ebk \u2212 \u01ebq+k ))]\nZ\n1\n1\n+ d2 q\nIm\n\u01eb\n\u01eb\n\u03a0(q\n+\nk,\n\u01ebq + \u01ebk )\nq\nk\nq\n[\u03b4f (k)(n(\u01ebq ) \u2212 n(\u01ebk + \u01ebq ))\n\n+\u03b4f (q)(n(\u01ebk ) \u2212 n(\u01ebk + \u01ebq ))]]\n\n(3)\n\nis a sum of all incoming and outgoing quasiparticle scattering processes. A central quantity appearing in the\ncollision integral is the polarization function\nX Z d2 p\nG0 (p + q, \u03c9n + \u03a9m )G0 (p, \u03c9n )\n\u03a0(q, i\u03a9m ) = T\n(2\u03c0)2\nn\n\n(4)\n\nk,\u03c9n\n\n+\n\nU\n2N \u03b2\n\nX\n\nwhere the bare field propagator G0 (p, \u03c9n ) = (p2 + \u03c9n2 +\nm2 )\u22121 . As it is the imaginary part of \u03a0 that is required\nin the collision integral, we must perform an analytical\ncontinuation \u03a9n \u2192 \u2212i\u03a9n \u2212 \u03b4 with \u03b4 a positive infinitesimal. Unlike Damle and Sachdev [17], we have found it\nconvenient to work directly in d=2 within a large N expansion. Eq. (2) represents the linear integral equation\nthat must be solved in the generic case to determine the\nrole of the quartic term on the collision-induced conductivity.\nTo compute the conductivity, we work in the\nrelaxation-time approximation in which I{\u03b4f } \u2248\n\u2212\u03b4f (k)/\u03c4k . In this approximation, the conductivity\nemerges as a momentum integration of the form,\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n\u2202n(\u01ebk )\nd2 k kx2\n(e\u2217 )2\n\u2212\n.\n(5)\n\u03c3=2\n\u03c4\nk\nh\u0304\n(2\u03c0)2 \u01eb2k\n\u2202\u01ebk\n\n\u03b4\u03c91 +***\u03c94 ,0 \u03b4k1 +***k4 ,0\n\n\u03c91 ,...,\u03c94 ;k1 ,...,k4\n\n\u03c8\u03bd (\u03c91 , k1 )\u03c8\u03bd (\u03c92 , k2 )\u03c8\u03bc (\u03c93 , k3 )\u03c8\u03bc (\u03c94 , k4 )\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c8(r, \u03c4 ) is the complex Bose order parameter whose\nexpectation value is proportional to hexp(i\u03c6)i, where \u03c6\nis the phase of a particular junction. The summation\nin the action over discrete Matsubara frequencies, \u03c9i =\n2\u03c0ni T , and integration over continuous wavevectors, k, is\nassumed. The parameter m2 is the inverse square of the\ncorrelation length. In writing the action in this fashion,\nwe have already included the one-loop renormalization\narising from the quartic term. In the quantum-disordered\nregime, m \u226b T and hence it is the quantum fluctuations\nthat dominate the divergence of the correlation length.\nOur goal is to calculate the conductivity in the quantum disordered regime in the collision-dominated limit.\nFollowing the quantum kinetic approach of Damle and\nSachdev [17], we introduce the distribution function,\nf (k, t) for quasiparticles. We have suppressed the distinction between particles and holes as they have identical distribution functions. The quantum kinetic equation\nfor the quasiparticle distribution function f (k, t) takes\nthe following form\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u03b4f (k, t) + e\u2217 E(t) n(\u01ebk ) = I{\u03b4f }\n\u2202t\n\u2202k\n\n(2)\n\nwhen it is linearised in the correction \u03b4f (k, t) to the equilibrium Bose distribution n(\u01ebk ) = (e\u01ebk /T \u2212 1)\u22121 that is\ninduced by the electric field E(t).\n\u221a The gapped dispersion\nrelation for the bosons is \u01ebk = k 2 + m2 . The resultant\nlinearised collision integral [20]\n\"Z\n1\n1\n1\nI{\u03b4f } = \u2212\nIm\nd2 q\nN (2\u03c0)2 \u01ebq+k >\u01ebk\n\u01ebq+k \u01ebk \u03a0(q, \u01ebq+k \u2212 \u01ebk )\n2\n\nWe must extract then the relaxation time, \u03c4k from the\ncollision integral. In the quantum-disordered regime, the\nstatistics of the quasiparticles becomes Boltzmannian because m \u226b T . This property results in a suppression of\neach subsequent 1/N correction by a factor e\u2212m/T [21].\nHaving set N = 2, we obtain then from Eq.

Here we took into account the fact\nthat from Eq. (4), Im\u03a0(q, \u03a9) is an odd function of \u03a9 and\nused the identity 1 + n(\u01ebk \u2212 \u01ebq+k ) = \u2212n(\u01ebq+k \u2212 \u01ebk ).\nThe essence of our central result is that to leading order\nin T /m, the inverse relaxation time 1/\u03c4k is momentumindependent and given by\n\n\f1\n= \u03c0T e\u2212m/T .\n\u03c4\n\nIm\n\n(7)\n\nSubstitution of this expression into Eq. (5) leads to the\nmutual cancellation of the exponential factors yielding\nthe remarkable result\n\u03c3(T \u2192 0) =\n\n2 4e2\n.\n\u03c0 h\n\n(8)\n\nIt is easy to show from the above expression that when\np\n\u03a92 \u2212 q 2 > 2m, the leading term of the imaginary part\nis temperature independent and equal to\n\n(10)\n\nwhile in all other cases, such a contribution is absent and\nthe leading temperature dependence comes from the first\nterm in\nZ\n1\nd2 p\nIm\u03a0(q, \u03a9) = \u2212\n{|n(\u01ebp+q ) \u2212 n(\u01ebp )|\n16\u03c0\n\u01ebp \u01ebp+q\n\u03b4(|\u01ebp+q \u2212 \u01ebp | \u2212 \u03a9) + (n(\u01ebp+q ) + n(\u01ebp ))\n\u03b4(\u01ebp+q + \u01ebp \u2212 \u03a9)},\n\n16m\n4\n\u03c02\n\nln\n\n2\n\n4m\n|q\u2212k|\n\n+1\n\n.\n\n(13)\n\nThis suggests that in the limit m/T \u2192 \u221e, the contribution to the relaxation time arising from the second term is\nlogarithmically suppressed compared to the contribution\nfrom the first term. Substitution of Eq. (12) into Eq.\n(6) and performing the q\u2212integration we arrive at the\nadvertised result, Eq. (7), to leading accuracy in T /m.\nThis result is truly remarkable, because, as one can\nsee, the conductivity in the quantum disordered regime\n(in the leading approximation) depends neither on temperature nor on the distance from the transition point.\nThis means that the dc conductivity in this model, \u03c3 =\n\u03c3Q g(m/T ), where g is a universal function close to the\ntransition point, displays a crossover upon lowering T\nfrom the universal value in the quantum critical regime\n[17], \u03c3Q , to the smaller value, Eq. (8) in the quantumdisordered regime. Though we focused on the relaxation\ntime approximation, it is possible to verify a posteriori\nthat the incoming term in the collision integral provides\na contribution subdominant in T /m. Indeed, seeking the\nsolution of the kinetic equation by means of consecutive\napproximations \u03b4f (k) = \u03b4f (0) (k) + \u03b4f (1) (k) + * * *, where\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(Ek) \u2202n\n\u03b4f (0) (k) = \u2212e\u2217 \u03c4k\n,\n(14)\n\u01ebk\n\u2202\u01ebk\n\nIt is curious to note [22] that a similar cancellation of\nexponential factors (from the mean free path and the\ndensity of states) arises in the context of the quasiparticle\nconductivity in a dirty d-wave superconductivity yielding\nthe identical numerical prefactor 2/\u03c0.\nTo establish this result, we obtain a workable expression for the inverse polarization function. In the leading\napproximation in T /m, the real part of the polarization\nfunction can be found from its value at T = 0 [21]:\np\n1\nq 2 \u2212 \u03a92\narctan\n\u03a0(q, \u03a9) = p\n(9)\n2m\n4\u03c0 q 2 \u2212 \u03a92\n\n1\n,\nIm\u03a0(q, \u03a9) = \u2212 p\n8 \u03a92 \u2212 q 2\n\n1\n\u2248\n\u03a0(q + k, \u01ebq + \u01ebk )\n\n(11)\n\nwhich is obtained by applying the Poisson summation\nformula to Eq. (4) [21]. The \u03b4\u2212 functions are eliminated\nupon an angular integration. As we are concerned with\nthe quantum-disordered\nregime, we focus on the limits\n\u221a\nq, k \u2264 mT \u226a m. Because in the first term in Eq. (6),\nq > |\u01ebq+k \u2212 \u01ebk |, we must use Eq. (11) to determine the\nimaginary part of the inverse polarization function. Using the fact that in the region of momentum integration,\n|Re\u03a0(q, \u03a9)| \u226b |Im\u03a0(q, \u03a9)|, we obtain that\nr\n1\n8\u03c0m2 \u03c0T \u2212m/T \u2212(q+(qk)/q)2 /2mT\nIm\n\u2248\ne\n*e\n\u03a0(q, \u01ebq+k \u2212 \u01ebk )\nq\n2m\n\u0010\n\u0011\ne(\u01ebq+k \u2212\u01ebk )/T \u2212 1 .\n(12)\nIn the second term of the Eq. (6) we have that [(\u01ebq +\n\u01ebk )2 \u2212 (q + k)2 ] > 2m. So, it would be sufficient to use\nEq. (10) for the imaginary part, and the real part can be\nobtained from Eq. (9) yielding\n\n3\n\nwe obtain after substitution into the kinetic equation,\nthat \u03b4f (1) (k) is proportional to higher powers of T /m\nthan are the outgoing terms. Consequently, this subdominance justifies the relaxation time approximation in\nwhich only outgoing terms are retained.\nThe universal value for the conductivity, Eq. (8), was\nobtained for the region near the zero- temperature IST\npoint, where m \u226a 1. However, it is not difficult to see\nthat the above results can be generalized for the case\nm \u2248 O(1), keeping T \u226a 1. One needs only to make the\nsubstitution in the collision integral\n1\nU\n1\nIm\n\u2192 Im\n.\nN\n\u03a0(q, \u03a9)\n1 + U N \u03a0(q, \u03a9)\n\n(15)\n\nThe subsequent steps are identical to those described\nabove and yield the value of the conductivity\n\u03c3(T \u2192 0) =\n\nU2\n4e2\n2\n.\n2\n\u03c0 (4\u03c0m + U ) h\n\n(16)\n\nAs expected, this value is not universal, and both m and\nU are the functions of parameters of the initial microscopic Hamiltonian. So, the leveled resistivity, generally\nspeaking, depends on the distance from the transition\npoint. In the limit m \u226a 1, Eq. (16) reduces to the\nuniversal value (8). Note this result is specific to 2D.\nBecause the conductivity is not [27] universal for the 3D\nsystem, the 3D case deserves special attention.\n\n\fIn the approximation that the inverse quasiparticle\nscattering rate is small relative to its energy, the general form for the conductivity, Eq. (5), can be obtained\nfrom the standard Kubo formula [11,18]. With this realization, the central result, Eq. (8), can be obtained from\nEq. (8) of Ref. (18) by making the substitution \u03b7 \u2192 1/\u03c4\n(\u03ba = 1), with 1/\u03c4 given by Eq. (7).\nIt is worth exploring how robust our bose metal is as\nit has not yet been observed generically in experiments\n[24\u201326]. For s-wave pairing, the pair amplitude survives\nin the presence of weak disorder [28]. Consequently, the\nBose metal remains intact in this limit. As a result, we\nhave constructed a concrete example of an interactioninduced metal that persists in the limit of weak disorder.\nThis is important as metallic phases have been observed\nin thin films [16,25,31] which should nominally exhibit\nonly insulating or superconducting phases. For example,\nJaeger, et. al. [31] have observed a downturn followed by\na leveling of the resistance in Ga and In thin films with\na saturation value ranging between 0.5k\u03a9 \u2212 50k\u03a9. Our\nvalue of (\u03c0/2)h/4e2 \u2248 10k\u03a9 is certainly within the experimental range over which the Bose metal phase has been\nobserved. Hence the Bose metal is a serious candidate to\nexplain these experimental observations. In addition, the\nnew metallic phase in a dilute 2D electron gas can also be\nexplained by the Bose metal phase if Cooper pairs form\nat the melting boundary of a 2D Wigner crystal as has\nbeen suggested previously [32].\nExperimentally, measurements of the dc-conductivity\nare always made at finite frequency. As the frequencydependent conductivity has a Lorentzian-type peak at\n\u03c9 = 0 with a width of order 1/\u03c4 , the theoretical constraint on the experimental observation of the Bose metal\nis that \u03c9 \u226a 1/\u03c4 . For a temperature of 0.1K, the relaxation time, Eq. (7) is 1010 exp (\u2212m/T )sec\u22121 , where\nm \u226a T . Typical experimental frequencies under which\nthe dc-conductivity is measured are on the order of several Hz. Hence, the Bose metal can be observed provided\nthat T > 0.05m. Typically, T > 0.1m. Consequently,\nthere does not appear to be any experimental constraint\nregarding the frequency that prohibits the observation of\nthe Bose metal phase.\nWhat about dissipation? We have assumed in thus\nfar that the only source of quasiparticle relaxation is the\nquartic term in the Ginzburg-Landau action. Meanwhile,\nother dissipative mechanisms are present in real experimental systems exhibiting the IST. For example, considering the dissipation-tuned [26,9,10] IST, Ohmic dissipation of the form \u03b7|\u03c9n | is always a relevant perturbation\n[18,29] arising generically from coupling to a lattice or an\nOhmic resistor. For d-wave pairing, static disorder leads\nto Ohmic dissipation [30]. Provided that \u03b7 < m, in the\nlowest approximation, the inverse relaxation time 1/\u03c4 can\nbe replaced by 1/\u03c4ef f = 1/\u03c4 + \u03b7(k, T ), where in the case\nof Ohmic dissipation \u03b7(k, T ) = \u03b7, and our formula for\nthe conductivity reads in the quantum disordered regime\n\n\u03c3(T ) = 2\n\nT\n(e\u2217 )2\n.\nh \u03b7em/T + \u03c0T\n\n(17)\n\nWe see, that already for very small \u03b7 the conductivity\nquickly starts to decrease exponentially with lowering\ntemperature. This result is certainly intriguing and raises\nfundamental questions regarding the origin of the insulating state based on quantum fluctuations. We propose\nthen that the more correct phase diagram for insulatorsuperconductor transitions is Fig. (1) in which it is\nclearly depicted that quantum fluctuations alone are insufficient to drive the insulating state. The finite temperature line starting at TKT and terminating at gc describes\nthe standard Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. In the absence of dissipation, the TKT line separates a superconductor and a Bose metal, not a superconductor and an\ninsulator as had traditionally been thought. Systematic\nstudies are needed in the presence of weak dissipation\nare needed to see if an insulator replaces the Bose metal\nphase at low temperatures.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank the NSF grant No. DMR98-96134 for funding this work and A.
