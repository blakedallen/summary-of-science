Bakker, and F. Pijlman\nDepartment of Physics and Astronomy\nVrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, the Netherlands\nWe calculated bound states in the quantum field theoretical approach. Using the Wick-Cutkosky model and an\nextended version of this model (in which a particle with finite mass is exchanged) we have calculated the bound\nstates in the scalar case.\n\n1. Introduction\nThere are several ways of calculating the bound\nstates of a system in the context of quantum field\ntheory. We have chosen to calculate the bound\nstates in a quantum field theoretical approach in\nLight Front Dynamics (LFD), since LFD is very\nwell suited for this problem (see e.g. [1], [2]).\nOur goal is to move towards QCD, but before\ntreating a realistic system we have done calculations in the scalar case. In the case that a massless particle is exchanged (\u03bc = 0) we treat the\nWick-Cutkosky model. An extended version of\nthis model is used in the case that a particle with\nmass (\u03bc 6= 0) is exchanged. Work on this subject\nhas already been done by others; e.g. [3\u20135].\nAfter setting up the equation and explaining\nwhich method we use to solve it (section 2), we\nwill present some results in section 3. At the end\nwe will give a short conclusion and outlook.\n2. Setting up the problem and solving it\nThe physical system we have looked at consists\nof two scalar particles of equal mass m exchanging\nanother scalar particle. This particle can either\nhave a mass equal to zero (\u03bc = 0) or it can have a\nmass \u03bc unequal to zero. The Lagrangian for this\nsystem is given by:\n1\nm2 2 1\n\u2202\u03bc \u03a8\u2202 \u03bc \u03a8 \u2212\n\u03a8 + \u2202\u03bc \u03a6\u2202 \u03bc \u03a6\n2\n2\n2\n\u03bc2 2\n2\n(1)\n\u2212 \u03a6 \u2212 g\u03a6\u03a8 ,\n2\nwhere g is the coupling constant.\nTaking along only two and three particle states,\nwe can derive the bound-state equation from this\n\nL =\n\nlagrangian. It is given by:\n\u0015\n\u0002 2\np~\u22a52 + m2\n\u03a8(~\np\u22a5 , x) =\nM \u2212\nx(1 \u2212 x)\nZ\ng2\nd2 ~p\u22a5\u2032 dx\u2032 K(~\np\u22a5 , x; p~\u22a5\u2032 , x\u2032 )\u03a8(~\np\u22a5\u2032 , x\u2032 ) . (2)\n(2\u03c0)3\nHere M is the total mass of the system and\nK(~\np\u22a5 , x; p~\u22a5\u2032 , x\u2032 ) is the kernel of the equation.\nThere are several possible expressions for the\nkernel, depending on what approximation we\nmake. Here we have been working in the ladder approximation. In first order we have two\ntime ordered diagrams (Fig. 1).

First order time-ordered diagrams in\nthe ladder approximation for one particle exchange.\ndiagrams corresponds to an energy denominator\nwhich is present in the kernel of the bound-state\nequation (Eq. (2)). The total kernel contains,\nbesides the energy denominators, a phase-space\nfactor and a theta function, which determines in\nwhich time-ordering we are working.\n\n\f2\nFor the total kernel we can write:\nK(~\np\u22a5 , x; p~\u2032\u22a5 , x\u2032 ) =\n\u0010\n\u2032\n1\n\u03a6(x,x\u2032 )\n\n\u03b8(x \u2212x)\n2(x\u2032 \u2212x)Da\n\n+\n\n\u03b8(x\u2032 \u2212x)\n2(x\u2212x\u2032 )Db\n\n\u0011\n\n.\n\n(3)\n\nHere \u03a6(x, x\u2032 ) is representing the phase-space factor, which is given by:\np\n(4)\n\u03a6(x, x\u2032 ) = x(1 \u2212 x)x\u2032 (1 \u2212 x\u2032 ) ,\n\nand Da and Db are the energy denominators corresponding to left or right graph in Fig. 1.

The wave functions depend on both x\nand |~\np| and we have used two different functions\nto expand in. For the x part of the wave function\nwe have used cubic spline functions and for the\n|~\np| part we have used a basis which was first introduced by Olsson [6] and Weniger [7]. We have\ntested the latter basis in instant form [8] and we\nhave seen that it works well.\n3. Results\nUsing the method described in the previous section, we are able to calculate the spectra and wave\nfunctions in case of massless exchange as well as\nin the case of massive exchange. Here we have\nto remark that we did not take into account any\nhigher order terms in the Hamiltonian or self energy diagrams.\nFirst of all we have looked at how many functions we need to take along to reach a reasonable convergence. A reasonable number of spline\nfunctions to take into account in the calculations\nis 10. Although 8 spline functions is a bit on the\n\nlow side, it already gives good results as well. For\nthe Olsson Weniger functions we need to take 3\nfunctions to reach a good convergence. Taking\nless functions already gives a good convergence\nin the lower states, but not in the higher excited\nstates. Note that increasing the number of Olsson Weniger functions in the expansion causes a\nlarge increase in computer time. Due to this we\nhave chosen to use 8 spline functions and 3 Olsson Weniger functions in the expansion to obtain\nthe results presented here.\nIn the case of massless exchange (\u03bc = 0.0) we\nhave calculated the masses given in the second\ncolumn of table 1. In the third column of this\ntable the masses of the bound states are given\nin the case of massive exchange (\u03bc = 0.15). In\nboth cases we have used a mass m = 1.0 for the\nparticles and a coupling constant of g = 17.36.\nn\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\nmass (\u03bc = 0.0)\n0.75\n1.63\n1.74\n1.86\n1.91\n\nmass (\u03bc = 0.15)\n0.91\n1.75\n1.86\n-\n\nTable 1\nMasses corresponding to the bound states calculated in the case of massless and massive exchange using the following parameters: m = 1.0\nand g = 17.36.\nWe have also calculated the wave functions corresponding to the masses given in table 1. For\nthe massless case the wave functions corresponding to the first three states are given in Fig. 2,\n3 and 4. The wave function corresponding to\nthe ground state in the case of massive exchange\n(\u03bc = 0.15) is given in Fig. 5. Looking at these\nfigures one should notice that the wave functions\nare not drawn in the ordinary way. This is due to\nthe fact that the wave function depends on x (the\nfraction of the p+ -momentum) and ~p\u22a5 , instead of\np~ as is usually the case.\n4. Conclusions and outlook\nThe bound-state equation in the scalar case is\nsolved by making an expansion into basis func-\n\n\f3\n\nFigure 5. Ground state wave function in the case\nof massive exchange (\u03bc = 0.15).\nFigure 2. Ground state wave function for massless\nexchange.\ntions. The basis we have used is well suited for\nthis problem and we expect it to work in more\nrealistic cases as well. With this method we can\ncalculate the ground state as well as excited states\nin both cases, massless and massive exchange.\nThe plans for the future are to move towards a\nmore realistic system, i.e. to include spin. And\nalso to included higher order terms in the Hamiltonian and see whether these terms give a large\ncontribution.\nREFERENCES\nFigure 3.
