We show that the problem is reminis ent of an impurity in a Luttinger\nliquid, but with a di\u001berent dependen e on the intera tion parameters due to spin-\u001dip s attering.

Stri tly\nspeaking, none of the available experiments has rea hed\nthe extreme one-dimensional (1D) limit. It would be interesting to look for e\u001be ts spe i\u001c to 1D systems, whose\ntransport properties are unique. These systems fall into\nthe universality lass of Luttinger Liquids (LL), whi h\nare distinguished by the absen e of stable quasi-parti le\nex itations. A lear signature of a LL is a power-law\ndependen e of the ondu tan e through a non-magneti\nimpurity.\nAt T = 0, a vanishingly small barrier is\nable to produ e perfe t re\u001de tion if the arriers intera t\nrepulsively.\nThe e\u001be t of non-magneti impurities suggests a similar phenomenon in the ase of a magneti inhomogeneity.\nIn this arti le we show that a magneti domain wall behaves as a spin-\u001dip impurity in a LL. We analyze the\nba ks attering term of the domain wall in the limit of\nweak s attering. It is governed by an\u0001 anomalous dimension given primarily by Kc + Ks\u22121 /2, where Kc and\nKs are the LL intera tion parameters. There is also a\norre tion due to the asymmetry between up and down\nspin ele trons introdu ed by the ex hange \u001celd. In the\nase of lo al repulsive intera tions, this should lead to\nan anomalously large and temperature-dependent magnetoresistan e in one-dimensional systems.\nWe onsider intera ting ele trons oupled to a magneti domain wall as des ribed by the Hamiltonian\n1,2,3,4,5,6,7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nsity at site j . We assume a stati , pinned magneti domain wall des ribed in the ontinuum limit by setting\nS (x) = S cos \u03b8 (x) \u1e91 + S sin \u03b8 (x) \u0177. For a Blo h domain\nwall, we take cos \u03b8 (x) = \u2212 tanh (x/\u03bb), with \u03bb being the\nwall width. The term Hint a ounts for ele tron-ele tron\nintera tions. In a uniformly magnetized system, the spin\npolarization gives rise to di\u001berent intera tion onstants\ng\u2191 and g\u2193 between ele trons with the same spin and g\u22a5\nbetween ele trons with opposite spins, due to the absen e\nof SU(2) symmetry. In a system ontaining a domain\nwall, the lo al magnetization a ts as an e\u001be tive magneti \u001celd on the ondu tion ele trons. The \u001crst order\napproa h is to assume that the intera tion onstants are\ndi\u001berent for the spin densities in the dire tion \u001cxed by\nthe spin ba kground\n13\n\n10,11,12\n\nH=\n\nX\nk\u03c3\n\n\u01ebk c\u2020k\u03c3 ck\u03c3 \u2212 JK\n\nX\nj\n\nSj * sj + Hint ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere ck\u03c3 destroys a ondu tion ele tron with momentum k and spin proje tion \u03c3, \u01ebk = k2 /2m for quadrati\ndispersion, JK is the Kondo oupling onstant between\nondu tion ele trons and lo alized spins Sj , and sj =\nP\n\u2020\n1\n\u03b1\u03b2 cj\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 cj\u03b2 is the ondu tion ele tron spin den2\n\nHint =\n\nwhere\n\nZ\n\ndx\n\nng\n\n\u2191 2\n\u03c1\u2227\n\n2\n\n\u03c1\u2227,\u2228 (x) = \u03c8 \u2020 (x)\n\n+\n\no\ng\u2193 2\n\u03c1\u2228 + g \u22a5 \u03c1\u2227 \u03c1\u2228 ,\n2\n\n1 \u00b1 \u03c3 * e (x)\n\u03c8 (x) ,\n2\n\nand e (x) = cos \u03b8 (x) \u1e91 + sin \u03b8 (x) \u0177. This expression\nshould be exa t in the limit of long domain walls. For\nlow polarizations (JK \u2192 0), we re over spin degenera y and all the intera tion onstants must be equal\n(g\u2191 = g\u2193 = g\u22a5 ).\nIt is now onvenient to perform a spin gauge transformation that aligns the spin of the ondu tion ele trons\nwith the lo al magnetization. This amounts to rotating\nthe spin density operator s (x) by the angle \u03b8 (x) around\nthe x axis, whi h is a omplished by the operator\n2\n\nU = exp\n\n\u001a Z\n\u0011\u001b\n\u0010\ni\n,\ndx \u03b8 (x) \u03c8\u2193\u2020 \u03c8\u2191 + \u03c8\u2191\u2020 \u03c8\u2193\n2\n\nwhere \u03c8\u03c3 (x) is the \u001celd operator for ondu tion ele trons.

This orresponds to the \u001crst orre tion\nto the adiabati limit of a very long domain wall, whi h\nprodu es no s attering.\nWe now fo us on the long-wavelength limit of the ondu tion ele trons. In this limit, we an linearize the dispersion around the Fermi points.

The \u001celd operator \u03c8\u03c3 then\nnaturally separates into right and left parts\n\nBosonization enables one to build an e\u001be tive theory by mapping the fermioni operators into asso iated\nbosoni \u001celds.

It is lear from Eq.

We \u001crst fo us on the \u03b6 \u2192 0 ase. For\nD > 1 or Kc + Ks\u22121 > 2, the s attering is irrelevant\n\nand the \u001cxed point is a LL with perfe t transmission of\nharge and spin. For D < 1 or Kc + Ks\u22121 < 2, whi h is\nfavored for in reasingly repulsive intera tions (de reasing Kc ), the s attering is relevant and the system \u001dows\nto the strong oupling limit. This limit orresponds to\ntwo semi-in\u001cnite LLs with spins polarized in opposite dire tions and oupled through a small hopping term that\n\u001dips the ele tron spin in the tunneling pro ess.

For D > 1, the resistan e vanishes as a power law when T \u2192 0; for D < 1,\nit diverges in the limit T \u2192 0. The LL behavior is ut o\u001b\nat a temperature T \u2217 \u223c vF /L, below whi h the transport\nis dominated by the Fermi Liquid leads. This an be\nunderstood as follows. The domain wall is known to indu e long-ranged spin density os illations in the ele tron\ngas. Similarly to what happens with harge density osillations reated by non-magneti impurities, the s attering by these spin density os illations diverges at low\n\u03c9 in one dimension. As a result, the ele trons are totally\nre\u001de ted by the wall.\nFinally, let us estimate the exponent in the parti ular\nase of the Hubbard model. Due to the absen e of SU(2)\nsymmetry, we annot take Ks = 1 as usual. Instead,\nthe parameters Kc and Ks depend\nimpli\nitly on \u03b6 . To\n\u0002\n\u0001\u0003\u22121\nlowest order in \u03b6 , Ks \u2248 1 + 2 ln \u03b6 \u22121\n. Note that\nthis orre tion has a lower order dependen e on \u03b6 than\nthe expli it one (order \u03b6 2 ) in Eq. (11). Furthermore,\na \u001cnite polarization makes Ks > 1 and so pushes the\nmodel into the insulating region of the phase diagram.\nFor small U , Kc \u2248 1 \u2212 aU/2\u03c0vF + O (\u03b6), where U is\nthe on-site repulsion \u0002and a is the\nlatti e spa ing. Then,\n\u0001\u0003\n\u22121 \u22121\nD \u2248 1 \u2212 aU/4\u03c0vF \u2212 4 ln \u03b6\n. As an experimental\ntest of this theory, one should look for the dependen e\nof the resistan e exponent on the polarization \u03b6 of the\nunderlying system of arriers.\nIn on lusion, we have shown that the domain wall\ns attering in a Luttinger Liquid is the magneti analogue\nof the Kane-Fisher problem. Just as a non-magneti impurity, a domain wall breaks the translation symmetry of\nthe ele tron gas. The 2kF mode of the wall gives rise to\na spin-\u001dip ba ks attering term whi h is relevant for repulsive intera tions. In this ase, the magnetoresistan e\ndiverges as a power law in the limit of zero temperature.\nBy applying magneti \u001celds one an insert or remove a\nsingle domain wall and then swit h between a spin- harge\ninsulator and a Luttinger Liquid with perfe t ondu tan e. This should be relevant in view of the quest for\nsystems exhibiting large magnetoresistan e.\nThis work was supported by Fapesp through grants\n01/12160-5 (RGP) and 01/00719-8 (EM), and by CNPq\nthrough grant 301222/97-5 (EM).\n12\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nKc\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n13\n\nFigure 1: Phase diagram for a Luttinger Liquid oupled to\na magneti domain wall. The ba ks attering term Hw(b) is\nmarginal on the straight line in the limit \u03b6 \u2192 0, and on the\ndashed one for \u03b6 = 0.4 (with all velo ities equal).

As a result, the \u001cxed point is\na spin- harge insulator at T = 0. The straight line in\nFig. 1 represents the marginal line D = 1 in the limit\n\u03b6 \u2192 0.\nThe orre tion for \u001cnite \u03b6 vanishes when Kc Ks =\nv1 /v2 . A tually, this an ellation happens to all orders\nin \u03b6 be ause the equations (8) are always satis\u001ced for\n\u03c6 = 0, \u03ba = Kc and \u03bc = Ks = v1 /v2 Kc . Consequently,\nthe ondition Kc Ks = v1 /v2 de\u001cnes a line in parameter spa e where the dimension of the s attering term\nis \u03b6 -invariant. In parti ular, the non-intera ting point\nKc = Ks = 1 (and v1 = v2 = vF ) is always marginal. For\nKc Ks 6= v1 /v2 , the dimension varies with \u03b6 . The dashed\nline in Fig. 1 shows how the marginal line is modi\u001ced for\n\u03b6 = 0.4 and vc = vs = v1 = v2 = vF .\nThe dimension D manifests itself in the exponent of the\nfrequen y-dependent domain wall resistan e.
