The determination, from the study of p-A collisions, of the J/\u03c8 behaviour in nuclear matter is, therefore, extremely important to correctly quantify the amount of charmonia suppression\ninduced by the deconfined medium. In this paper the new NA60 results collected at 158 GeV incident energy, i.e. under the same kinematical conditions as the In-In (NA60) and Pb-Pb (NA50)\ndata, are presented and compared with p-A measurements from other fixed target experiments.\nResults on A-A collisions are also reviewed taking into account the new available information\non the influence of cold nuclear matter on the J/\u03c8 production yield. Finally, results on the J/\u03c8\npolarization are shown for p-A and A-A collisions.\n\n1. Introduction\nJ/\u03c8 suppression in A-A collisions is considered to be one of the main signatures for the phase\ntransition from an hadronic to a deconfined medium [1]. However, the J/\u03c8 production can be\naffected also by cold nuclear matter effects, as, for example, the final state absorption of the cc\u0304\npair in the nuclear medium, the parton shadowing or the initial and final state energy loss. The\namplitude of these effects, not related to the formation of a deconfined medium, is determined\nfrom p-A collisions and then extrapolated to A-A interactions to be compared with the measured\nJ/\u03c8 yield.\nAt SPS energies, cold nuclear matter effects are usually parameterized, in the frame of the\nGlauber model, by fitting the A-dependence of the J/\u03c8 production cross section per nucleonnucleon collision. These nuclear effects are quantified through the value of \u03c3J/\u03c8\nabs extracted, up to\nJ/\u03c8\nnow, from the NA50 data at 400/450 GeV (\u03c3abs = 4.2 \u00b1 0.5 mb) [2]. Another way to parameterize cold nuclear matter effects is based on a fit to the A-dependence of the J/\u03c8 production\ncross section using a A\u03b1 power law. A value of \u03b1 different from unity indicates how much the\nJ/\u03c8 yield is modified by the nuclear medium. It should be noted that both \u03b1 and \u03c3J/\u03c8\nabs are effective\nquantities, since they represent the amount of cold nuclear matter effects reducing the J/\u03c8 yield,\nbut they do not allow to disentangle the different contributions (e.g. shadowing, nuclear absorption) playing a role in this reduction. Nuclear effects, evaluated from p-A data at 400/450 GeV,\nare then extrapolated to A-A collisions at a lower energy (158A GeV) assuming in both cases a\nscaling with L, the mean thickness of nuclear matter seen by the cc\u0304 pair in its way out through the\nnucleus, and imposing \u03c3J/\u03c8\nabs to be energy independent. The expected J/\u03c8 yield is then compared\nwith the measured one, as a function of centrality. Following the aforementioned approach, a\nPreprint submitted to Nuclear Physics A\n\nSeptember 26, 2018\n\n\ffurther suppression (the so called \"anomalous\" J/\u03c8 suppression), exceeding cold nuclear matter\neffects, is indeed observed at SPS in Pb-Pb [3] and In-In [4] collisions. It is clear that to correctly\nquantify the amount of suppression due to the formation of a hot medium, the J/\u03c8 behaviour in\nthe normal nuclear matter must be determined with high precision.\nSeveral results on J/\u03c8 production in p-A collisions at fixed target experiments are available,\ncovering different kinematic and energy domains. HERA-B at HERA, for example, has studied\np-Cu, Ti, W reactions at 920 GeV [5], E866 at FNAL p-Be, Fe, W collisions at 800 GeV [6],\nNA50 at SPS proton induced collisions on several nuclei (Be, Al, Cu, Ag, W, Pb) at 400/450\nGeV [2] and finally NA3 at SPS p-H2 , Pt collisions at 200 GeV [7]. It is important to note that\nnone of these existing results has been obtained under the same conditions, in terms of energy and\nkinematic domain, as the SPS A-A collisions collected at 158A GeV. This implies that several\nassumptions (as the energy independence of \u03c3J/\u03c8\nabs ) had to be done, in order to extrapolate cold\nnuclear matter effects from p-A to A-A collisions.\n2. NA60 p-A results\nFor the first time the NA60 experiment has studied the J/\u03c8 production in p-A collisions at\n158 GeV [8], in order to provide a reference collected under the same kinematic and energy\nconditions as the A-A data.\nThe experimental apparatus of NA60 is based on a traditional muon spectrometer coupled\nwith a vertex telescope made of Si pixel planes, close to the target region. The matching, based on\nthe tracks coordinates and momentum between the tracks reconstructed in the two spectrometers,\nallows an accurate measurement of the muon kinematics and therefore an improvement in the\nquality of the results with respect to previous experiments. For details on the apparatus see [9].\nThe target system of NA60, during the p-A data taking, was based on 7 different targets (Be, Al,\nCu, In, W, Pb, U) simultanously exposed to the beam. NA60 has also collected data at 400 GeV,\nwith the same experimental setup as the one of the 158 GeV data taking period, to be used as a\ncross-check of the NA50 results taken at the same energy.\n2.1. J/\u03c8 kinematical distributions\nThe investigation of the J/\u03c8 kinematical distributions may help to obtain further insights in\nthe understanding of the charmonium production and initial state effects. In Fig.1 the rapidity\n(yCM ) distributions corresponding to p-A collisions at 158 GeV and 400 GeV are shown. A 1-D\nacceptance correction has been performed assuming realistic transverse momentum distributions\nand a flat cos\u03b8CS shape (see Sec.4 for this definition). Within the narrow rapidity coverage\nof NA60 (one rapidity unit), the distributions can be reproduced by a Gaussian function. A\nsimultaneous fit to the distributions corresponding to the different p-A collisions indicates that,\nat 158 GeV, the data can be described by a gaussian centered at midrapidity (\u03bcy = 0.05 \u00b1 0.05)\nwith a width \u03c3y = 0.51 \u00b1 0.02. At 400 GeV, because of the wider distributions, the peak position\nis less constrained. In this case the fit is performed imposing the slightly negative mean value\n(\u03bcy = \u22120.2) measured by NA50 with a high statistics data set at the same energy [2]. As expected,\nbecause of the higher energy, a larger rapidity width (\u03c3y = 0.81 \u00b10.03) is obtained, in agreement,\nwithin errors with the NA50 value (\u03c3y \u223c 0.85). Unfortunately, the precision of these results do\nnot allow to investigate the negative rapidity shift observed by NA50, neither to confirm the\nsmaller A-dependent shift of the center of the xF (and therefore y) distributions observed by\nHERA-B [5].\n2\n\n\fd\u03c3 / dy a.u\n\nd\u03c3 / dy a.u\n\np-U\np-Pb\np-W\np-In\np-Cu\np-Al\np-Be\n\n3\n\n10\n\n102\n\n-0.2\n\n3\n\n10\n\n102\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\nycm\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n-0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\nycm\n\nFigure 1: J/\u03c8 acceptance corrected rapidity distributions at 158 GeV (left) and 400 GeV (right).\n\nThe J/\u03c8 transverse momentum (pT ) distributions have also been studied. The spectra are\ncorrected with an 1-D acceptance, obtained assuming a flat pT distribution and realistic y and\ncos\u03b8CS shapes. A broadening of the pT distributions as a function of A is measured at both\n158 and 400 GeV. This confirms previous observations from other experiments [5, 7, 10, 11,\n12, 13, 14] and is usually interpreted as initial state multiple scattering of the incoming gluons\n(Cronin effect) before the hard scattering which will produce the cc\u0304 pair. The average < p2T >\ndependence on the mass number can be parameterized with < p2T >=< p2T > pp +\u03c1(A1/3 \u2212 1) [5],\nwhere A1/3 \u2212 1 is roughly proportional to the length L. As shown in Fig.2 (left) the < p2T > pp\nvalues are compatible with a linear growth with the square of the center of mass energy s. On\nthe other hand, the slope of the parameterization \u03c1 shows an almost energy independent pattern,\napart from a hint of decrease at low energy, corresponding to the NA60 158 GeV result.\n2.2. Cold nuclear matter effects\nNew NA60 results on the nuclear effects affecting the J/\u03c8 at 158 GeV have been presented\nat this conference [8]. Results, integrated over the full pT range are given in the rapidity region,\ncovered by all the subtargets, corresponding to 0.28 < yCM < 0.78. Nuclear effects are evaluated\nJ/\u03c8\ncomparing the cross section ratio, \u03c3J/\u03c8\npA /\u03c3 pBe , between the target with mass number A and the\nlightest one (Be). By computing this ratio, the beam luminosity factors cancel out, apart from a\nsmall beam attenuation factor. However, since the sub-targets see the vertex telescope under a\nslightly different angle, the track reconstruction efficiencies do not completely cancel out. Therefore an accurate evaluation of such quantities and their time evolution has been performed target\nby target, with high granularity down to the single pixel level, and on a run-per-run basis.\nJ/\u03c8 cross-section ratios are shown in Fig.2 (right) as a function of L. In the same figure, also\nresults from a similar analysis performed on the 400 GeV data sample are shown. In this case, the\nresults refer to the kinematical region \u22120.17 < yCM < 0.33, corresponding to the same rapidity\nrange, in the laboratory frame, as the 158 GeV one. Systematic errors include uncertainties on the\ntarget thickness, on the y distribution used in the acceptance calculation and on the reconstruction\n3\n\n\fp-Be\n\n1.1\n\n1.05\n1\n\ni\n\n\u03c3 (J/ \u03c8) / \u03c3 (J/ \u03c8)\n\nT\n\n<p 2>pp (GeV/c)2\n\n\u03c1 (GeV/c)2\n\n2.4\n2.2\n2\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n\nHERAB 920GeV\nFNAL exp. 800GeV\nNA50 450GeV\nNA60 158, 400GeV\nNA3 200GeV\n\n0.95\n\n0.85\n\n0.1\n\n0.8\n\n0.08\n\n0.75\n\n0.06\n\n158 GeV\n\n0.7\n\n0.04\n\n0.65\n\n0.02\n0\n\n400 GeV\n\n0.9\n\n0.6\n0\n\n250 500 750 1000 1250 1500 1750 2000\ns (GeV2)\n\nStatistical errors\nSystematic errors\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5 5\nL (fm)\n\nFigure 2: Left: energy dependence of the < p2T > pp (top) and \u03c1 (bottom) parameters.

Only the fraction of systematic error, not in common to all the points, is shown, since\nit is the one affecting the evaluation of the nuclear effects.\nPerforming a Glauber fit to the data, or using the \u03b1 parameterization, the following results are\nobtained for the new NA60 p-A data: \u03c3J/\u03c8\nabs = 7.6 \u00b1 0.7 (stat.) \u00b1 0.6 (syst.) mb (\u03b1 = 0.882 \u00b1 0.009\n\u00b1 0.008) at 158 GeV and \u03c3J/\u03c8\n=\n4.3\n\u00b1\n0.8\n(stat.) \u00b1 0.6 (syst.) mb (\u03b1 = 0.927 \u00b1 0.013 \u00b1 0.009) at\nabs\nJ/\u03c8\n400 GeV. It has to be stressed that the \u03c3abs result at 400 GeV is smaller with respect to the one\nextracted from the 158 GeV, pointing to an energy dependence of this quantity. Furthermore, the\nobtained value is in very good agreement with a previous result obtained by NA50 at the same\nenergy [2].\nThe comparison with results from previous experiments (HERA-B, E866 and NA50) can be\ndone in terms of the extracted \u03b1 [8] or \u03c3J/\u03c8\nabs values, as a function of the Feyman x variable (xF ). As\nshown in Fig.3 (left), where all the available measurements are compared, a strong dependence\nof \u03c3J/\u03c8\nabs on xF and on the beam energy is clearly visible. Cold nuclear matter effects are stronger\nat high xF and for a fixed xF value their importance increases while lowering the beam energy.\nAs shown in the figure, the new NA60 results at 400 GeV confirm the NA50 values obtained at\na similar energy. On the other hand, the 158 GeV data seem to point to higher \u03c3J/\u03c8\nabs values, with\na hint for an increase in the narrow explored xF region. It is also worthwhile to note that older\nNA3 results [7] on J/\u03c8 production are in partial contradiction with these observations, showing\nlower \u03c3J/\u03c8\nabs values, rather similar to those obtained with the higher energy data samples.\nAlthough not shown here, the results do not present any scaling with x2 , the fraction of\nnucleon momentum carried by the target colliding partons. Since x2 is the variable driving the\nshadowing effects, the break of this scaling confirms the fact that parton shadowing can not be\nthe only mechanism invoked to describe the data. It is, therefore, clear that the interpretation\nof the kinematical dependence of the cold nuclear matter effects is extremely complicated since\nthere are many competing mechanisms affecting the J/\u03c8 production and propagation into the\nnuclei. A theoretical description of the cold nuclear matter effects over the full kinematic range\nis extremely complex and not yet available [15, 16, 17].\n4\n\n\f20\n\nMeasured / Expected J/\u03c8 yield\n\n\u03c3abs (mb)\n\nAs discussed, the \u03b1 or the \u03c3J/\u03c8\nabs values are effective quantities used to describe the convolution\nof all the cold nuclear effects not related to the formation of a deconfined medium. At this\nconference, a first attempt to take explicitly into account the parton shadowing contribution to the\nNA60 data has been proposed. It must be noted that at SPS energies, the charmonia production\nexplores a range of x (the fraction of the nucleon momentum carried by the parton) corresponding\nto the antishadowing region, where parton densities in the nuclei are enhanced with respect to\nthose of the free nucleons. The antishadowing, evaluated with the EKS98[18] parameterization\nfor the nuclear modification of the parton distribution functions (PDF), causes an enhancement\nof the charmonium production cross section per nucleon-nucleon collision. Therefore, if this\nJ/\u03c8\ninitial-state contribution is explicitly taken into account, a larger \u03c3abs value is needed to describe\nJ/\u03c8\nJ/\u03c8\nthe measured data (\u03c3abs (158GeV) = 9.3 \u00b1 0.7 \u00b1 0.7 mb and \u03c3abs (400GeV) = 6.0 \u00b1 0.9 \u00b1 0.7\nmb). Results depend on the adopted parameterization of the PDF nuclear modifications. Slightly\nhigher \u03c3J/\u03c8\nabs values (\u223c 5 \u2212 10%), for example, are obtained if the EPS08 [19] parameterization is\nused.\n\nHERAB 920 GeV\nE866 800 GeV\nNA50 450 GeV\n\n15\n\nNA60 400 GeV\nNA3 200 GeV\nNA60 158 GeV\n\n10\n\n1.3\n1.2\n1.1\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n\n5\n\n0.6\n\n0\n-0.2 -0.1 -0\n\n0.5\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8\nxF\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450\n\nNpart\n\nJ/\u03c8\n\nFigure 3: Left: Compilation of \u03c3abs values versus xF .

Anomalous J/\u03c8 suppression in In-In and Pb-Pb collisions\nAs previously discussed, the cold nuclear matter reference used up to now for A-A collisions\nby NA50 [3] and NA60 [4] was based on the \u03c3J/\u03c8\nabs value obtained from p-A collisions at 400/450\nJ/\u03c8\nGeV, assuming \u03c3abs to be independent of the incident energy and yCM range. As shown in Fig.3\n(left), this is not the case, since the cold nuclear matter effects strongly depend on the energy and\nkinematical domain. Therefore the evaluation of the size of the effects affecting A-A collisions at\n158A GeV must be based on the new p-A NA60 results at the same energy. The expected shape\nfor the J/\u03c8 distribution in cold nuclear matter is computed within a Glauber model, assuming\nthe J/\u03c8 production as a function of centrality (determined measuring the energy, EZDC , released\n5\n\n\fexp\nin a Zero Degree Calorimeter) dNJ/\u03c8\n/dEZDC to scale with the number of binary collisions. The\n\nnuclear effects affecting the J/\u03c8 are then implemented assuming \u03c3J/\u03c8\nabs = 7.6 \u00b1 0.7 \u00b1 0.6 mb, as\ndiscussed in the previous section. This reference curve is then compared with the measured In-In\nmeas\ndNJ/\u03c8\n/dEZDC distribution, following the procedure described in [4]. As expected, since the\n\u03c3J/\u03c8\nabs value directly obtained at 158 GeV is higher than the one extracted from p-A data at 400/450\nGeV, the amount of anomalous suppression will be smaller with respect to the previous estimates.\nFurthermore, in the procedure followed up to now to build the reference curve, shadowing effects\nwere not explicitly taken into account. While in p-A data only partons in the target are affected\nby shadowing, in A-A collisions also the projectile is involved and this further contribution has\nto be included when extrapolating the cold nuclear effects from p-A to A-A [20]. It turns out\nthat if the shadowing is neglected in this extrapolation, a small bias is introduced, resulting in a\n\u223c5% artificial contribution to the suppression of the J/\u03c8 yield (if the EKS98 parameterization is\nused for the shadowing evaluation). Therefore, if shadowing is properly taken into account in the\nextrapolation from p-A to A-A, a further reduction of the J/\u03c8 suppression is observed. This is\nshown in Fig.3 (right), where the final ratio of the measured and expected J/\u03c8 yield is presented\nas a function of the number of participants (N part ) for both In-In and Pb-Pb data. Even within\nthis new definition of the reference curve, for very central Pb-Pb collisions (N part > 200) an\nanomalous J/\u03c8 suppression, of the order of 20-30%, is still visible.\n4. J/\u03c8 polarization\nThe measurement of the J/\u03c8 polarization is an important tool to clarify the quarkonium\nproduction mechanism, since different theoretical models predict different degrees of polarization [21]. For example, polarization is expected to be sensitive to the spin states of the cc\u0304\npair [22], therefore its measurement can shed some light on the color-singlet and color-octet\ncontributions to the production process. Contrary to other observables, as the differential crosssections, in the polarization predictions uncertainties related to the theoretical inputs cancel out,\ntherefore providing well-defined expected values. However, quarkonium polarization has always\nrepresented a puzzle, since, at collider experiments, the theoretical models, which were able\nto predict the observed J/\u03c8 production cross section, clearly failed in the description of the pT\ndependence of the polarization [23].\nExperimentally, the J/\u03c8 polarization is measured from the full angular distribution of the\nquarkonium decay products:\n\u03bd\ndN\n= 1 + \u03bbcos2 \u03b8 + \u03bcsin2\u03b8cos\u03c6 + sin2 \u03b8cos2\u03c6\ndcos\u03b8d\u03c6\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the polar angle \u03b8 is determined by the direction of the positive muon, in the quarkonium\nrest frame, and a chosen ~z polarization axis (defining the decay plane). \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle\nbetween the reaction plane, containing the colliding hadrons and the decay plane. The \u03bb parameter is traditionally called \"polarization\": zero value for \u03bb indicates that the J/\u03c8 are not polarized,\nwhile \u03bb=1(-1) means transverse (longitudinal) polarization. Non zero values of \u03bc and \u03bd indicate\nan azimuthal anisotropy of the distributions. \u03bb, \u03bc and \u03bd depend on the chosen definition of the\n~z axis. It is, therefore, useful, to determine these parameters in more than one reference frame.\nHowever, it can be noted that the knowledge of the full set of coefficients allows to analytically\ncalculate their values in other frames, through appropriate transformations and knowing the J/\u03c8\n6\n\n\f0\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u03bb\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n-0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.6\n-0.8\n\n0.4\n\n(c)\n\n(b)\n\n(d)\n\n0\n-0.2\n\nNA60, p-A 158GeV\nNA60, p-A 400GeV\nHERA-B, p-A 920 GeV\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n-0.4\n3.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n-0.1\n-0.2\n-0.3\n0\n\n(a)\n\n0.2\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u03bb\n\nkinematics [24]. Of course, this is not the case if only the \u03bb parameter is measured. In the literature the most commonly used frames are the Collins-Soper (CS) one, where the ~z axis is parallel\nto the bisector of the angle between the projectile and target directions in the J/\u03c8 rest frame, and\nthe helicity (HE) one, where the ~z axis coincides with the quarkonium direction in the targetprojectile center of mass frame. It is important to note that because of the \u03bb, \u03bc and \u03bd dependence\non a chosen reference frame, polarization results from different experiments can be compared\nonly if the same frame is adopted. Most previous polarization analyses up to now were limited\nto the choice of only one specific reference frame and were restricted to the measurement of the\npolar angle distribution. On the contrary, recent results from HERA-B [25] and NA60 [8] have\nbeen obtained measuring for the first time the full angular distribution of the decay products of\ncharmonia and comparing different frames.\nNA60 results are obtained applying a 1-D acceptance correction, assuming realistic yCM and\npT distributions and a flat cos\u03b8 and \u03c6 spectra. The measured polarization values present a dependence on the J/\u03c8 transverse momentum, as shown in Fig.4 (left) for the helicity frame. In\nparticular, HERA-B \u03bb results indicate an increase of the J/\u03c8 polarization, moving from slightly\nnegative values (corresponding to longitudinal polarization) at low pT to values close to zero\n(absence of polarization) at higher pT . The first polarization results obtained in p-A collisions at\n158 GeV and 400 GeV by the NA60 experiment confirm, within errors, the observed trend.\nIn Fig.4 (left) results on the the azimuthal parameter \u03bd are also shown, always in the helicity\nframe. In this case no clear dependence on the J/\u03c8 kinematics is visible. Also the \u03bc parameter\nis consistent with zero everywhere. Although not shown here, both HERA-B and NA60 results\nin the Collins-Soper reference frame give \u03bb values which tend to be more negative and larger in\nabsolute value with respect to the ones measured in the helicity frame. This is an confirmation\nof the fact that the polarization parameters have a clear dependence on the chosen frame.\n\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n3.5\np (GeV/c)\nT\n\n-0.4\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n2\np (GeV/c)\nT\n\n50\n\n100 150 200 250\nNpart\n\nFigure 4: Left: J/\u03c8 polarization parameters \u03bb (top) and \u03bd (bottom) as a function of pT in the helicity frame for p-A\ncollisions from HERA-B and NA60. Because of a slighty different definition of the \u03bd parameter, with respect to HERAB, the plotted NA60 \u03bd values have been divided by a factor 2 with respect to those obtained from Eq. 1. Right: \u03bb (a,c)\nand \u03bd (b,d) results for In-In collisions versus pT and centrality respectively. The boxes around the points represent the\ntotal error affecting the measurement, assuming, for the NA60 points, a conservative preliminary 0.1 systematic error.\n\nThe HERA-B and NA60 new polarization results clearly will shed some light on the polariza7\n\n\ftion issue, in the attempt of describing all the available polarization measurement in a common\nscenario.\nNA60 has also provided, for the first time, results on the full angular distribution of the J/\u03c8\ndecay products in In-In collisions. The \u03bb values, in the helicity frame, do not show a dependence\non the J/\u03c8 pT as shown in Fig4 (a) and they are almost consistent with zero everywhere. Also\nthe azimuthal coefficient \u03bd is rather small, pointing to a positive value only for pT \u223c 1 GeV/c, as\nshown in Fig4 (b). The \u03bb and \u03bd values do not present any dependence even on the centrality of\nthe collision, as shown in Fig.4 (c,d). The pattern of these results is confirmed also if the CollinsSoper frame is adopted. In principle, it may be expected that the formation of a hot medium may\naffect the J/\u03c8 polarization, as proposed in [26]. Therefore, quantitative predictions are needed,\nin order to clarify the observed results.\n5. Conclusions\nNew NA60 results obtained in p-A collisions at 158 and 400 GeV have been presented and\ncompared with the already existing measurements from other fixed target experiments. Cold\nnuclear matter effects, determined from p-A interactions, exhibit a rather strong energy and kinematical dependence. Therefore the use of the new p-A results at 158A GeV, the same energy\nas the A-A data, allows a more precise definition of the expected cold nuclear matter effects in\nnuclear collisions. Apart from very central Pb-Pb collisions, where the anomalous suppression\nis still sizeable, a smaller effect with respect to previous estimates is observed. Results on J/\u03c8\npolar and azimuthal parameters have also been presented for both p-A and A-A collisions.\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n[26]\n\nT.
