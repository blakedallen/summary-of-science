Consider two-step periodic dispersion map:\n \u0303\n \u0303 = d1 for 0 < z + nL < L/2\nd(z) = hdi + d(z),\nwhere d(z)\n \u0303 = \u2212d1 for L/2 < z + nL < L, hdi is the pathand d(z)\naveraged dispersion, d1 is the amplitude of dispersion\nvariation, L is a dispersion period and n is an arbitrary\ninteger number. Eq.

This model is\n1\n\n\f\u221a\n2.5, hdi = 0, t\u0303 = t/ s and \u03b2, \u03bb are given by (9), (10).\nIt is enough to consider only positive values of t because A(t) is an even function of t. Note that in case\nhdi = 0 eq. (5) is invariant under two scaling transforms: t \u2192 \u03b41 t, s \u2192 \u03b412 s, A(\u03c4 ) \u2192 A(\u03c4 /\u03b41 ) and\n\u03bb \u2192 \u03b422 \u03bb, A \u2192 \u03b42 A, which allows to extend results of\nFig.1 to all values of system parameters p, s (of course it\nhas a sense to consider only such values of p, s for which\ncondition Znl \u226b L holds).\nIt is seen in Fig. 1 that the convergence of iteration\nprocedure to soliton solution is very fast for small t and\n<\nbecomes slower for larger t. For |t\u0303| \u223c 1.3 the renormalization of A(1) by next iteration is very small. In par(n)\nticular for all n = 2, 3, . . . (Att /A(n ) t=0 differs from \u03b2\n\nof A(n\u22121) into right hand side of (5) for n = 1, 2, . . . The\noscillating tails appear at first iteration already. Simultaneously one can get the dependence of \u03b2 in eq. (4) on\ndispersion map strength s.\nRewriting the kernel of (2) via parametric integral:\nZ s\n\u0001\n1\nsin s\u03c91 \u03c92\n=\n(6)\nexp \u0131s\u2032 \u03c91 \u03c92 ds\u2032\ns\u03c91 \u03c92\n2s \u2212s\nand using (4) as zero iteration allow to make integration over time variables t1 , t2 in (3) explicitly and get\nexpressions for first A(1) , second A(2) , etc. iterations:\n\u0001\nZ s\u0303\n3\u0131+s\u2032 2\nexp \u2212 \u03b22 \u0131+3s\n\u2032t\n(1)\n(1)\n\u221a\nA =p\nds\u2032 ,\n1 \u2212 2\u0131s\u2032 + 3s\u20322\n\u2212s\u0303\nZ Z Z Z s\u0303\nexp(\u2212qt2 ) \u2032\n\u221a\nA(2) = p(2)\nds ds1 ds2 ds3 , (7)\nf1 f2 f3 g\n\u2212s\u0303\n\n<\n\ndetermined by (9) for less that 2%. For |t\u0303| \u223c 2.3 the good\n<\napproximation is given by second iteration, for |t\u0303| \u223c 3.2\nby third etc. The sequence of iteration can be interpreted as evolution of A along some artificial coordinate\nz\u0303 and it can indicate that the convergence of the solution\nof (3) during evolution along coordinate z to soliton solution (5) should also be slower for larger t what is really\nobserved in numerical experiments if \u03c8|z=0 is chosen in\nGaussian form12 .\nThus, provided the form of soliton is close to Gaussian for small and moderate t, the value of \u03b2s is universal and is given by (9). Zakharov and Manakov13\nproposed the other theory of DM soliton in strong DM\nlimit based on the assumption\u221athat typical width of A\ndistribution is much less than s. In present notation it\nmeans \u03b2s \u226b 1. Apriori one can not exclude that soliton\nsolution with \u03b2s \u226b 1 is also possible in addition to obtained here. But such solution can not be Gaussian-like\nand, according to best of my knowledge, in all numerical experiment so far the value of \u03b2s was of the order of\nunity (see e.g.3,9,10 ). Note that choice of \u03b2s \u226b 1 for zero\niteration results in convergence of iteration sequence (7)\nto Gaussian-like solution with \u03b2 is given by (9). It can\nindicate that solution of (3) for \u03b2s \u226b 1 also converges for\nlarge z to that Gaussian-like solution. One can not also\nexclude the existence of soliton with \u03b2s \u226b 1 for hdi 6= 0\nwhich is outside the scope of the present paper.\nLet us try to explore in more details in what sense soliton solution A is close to Gaussian. From (7), (8) and (9)\none can get series expansion (the approximate numerical value of s\u0303 is used here to avoid writing a cumbersome\nexpression for every term of expansion):\n\nA(3) = . . .\nwhere s\u0303 = \u03b2s, integration limits for all variables are\n\u0131+3s\n[\u2212s\u0303, s\u0303], fj = 1 \u2212 2\u0131sj + 3s2j , bj = 2\u03b2(3\u0131+sj j ) ,\nj =\n\u2032\n1, 2, 3, g = 4(4b1 b2 b3 \u2212 4\u0131b1 b2 s + (b1 + b2 + b3 )s\u20322 ),\nq = (4(b1 b2 + b1 b3 + b2 b3 ) + 4\u0131s\u2032 b3 + s\u20322 )/g, and p(n) is\ndetermined by the condition A(n) |t=0 = p for all n. Note\nthat instead of keeping A(n) t=0 constant for all iteraR\ntions it is also possible to fix the integral P0 \u2261 |A(n) |2 dt\nif one aims to get soliton solution with some definite\nvalue of P0 . In principle any values of \u03bb, \u03b2 can be chosen\nfor zero iteration but the most useful is to choose them\nin such a way to get A(1) as close as possible to A(0) in\norder to get faster convergence of iterations to true solution of eq. (5). It is convenient to make series expansion\nA(1) in powers of t2 which allows to integrate all terms\nof this expansion explicitly.

For this and larger scales there is no similarity between soliton and (4). Thus DM soliton is close\nto Gaussian exponent only with accuracy up to numerically \"small parameter\" \u223c 1/4 (because scale of Gaussian exponent is \u03b2t2 /2 = s\u0303t\u03032 /2 \u223c 1) and there is no\nreally small parameter describing this closeness. Nevertheless appearance of numerical \"small parameter\" 1/4\nexplains success of expansion of DM soliton solution in\nHermite polynomials10,11 which is basically equivalent to\nexpansion (11) in Taylor series.\n>\nFor larger scales |t\u0303| \u223c 1.3 the correct presentation of\nDM soliton requires a lot of terms of series expansion.\nInstead one can get asymptotical behavior from (7).
