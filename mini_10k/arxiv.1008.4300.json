Introduction\nThe Epoch of Reionization (hereafter EoR) demarcates the phase transition of the Universe,\nduring which the hydrogen gas turned from the neutral to the ionized state. The last two decades\nhave seen an increased theoretical effort to understand the interplay between the physical processes\nthat characterize the EoR. Nonetheless, observational evidence is still scarce and indirect [1]. The\nLOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) is one of the currently designed instruments with the aim to probe\nthe end of the Dark Ages and cosmic reionization and will reach the final stages of its construction\nat the end of this year (2010).\nOne of the most challenging aspects of the LOFAR EoR experiment is the large dynamic\nrange between the different components of the sky signal. Discrete sources can be of the order of\n101\u22125 Jy/beam while the Galactic diffuse emission, as well as the confusion, amount to 5mJy/beam\nand 3mJy/beam respectively1 . The noise in the data is of the order 10\u03bcJy/beam, while the desired\ncosmic signal of the order of 1\u03bcJy/beam, where we assumed a synthesized beam resolution of 3\narcminutes at 150 MHz. Even after very accurate foreground removal the EoR signal is still buried\ndeep in the noise. To reach the sensitivity required to statistically detect the EoR signal, a long\nobservation run of at least 400 hours is necessary. This will result in a recorded visibility dataset of\nthe order of one to two petabytes, including calibration and flagging meta-data.\nOne might therefore ask the question: What are the prospects and limitations of EoR imaging\nor power-spectrum estimation with a phased array? Even if the array is perfectly calibrated the\nresult will be noise-limited at diffraction-limited resolution. The fidelity of the map is difficult to\nassess even in this simple case, due to the improper sampling of the uv plane. This leads to a\nnumber of questions regarding the calibration:\n\u2022 How can we correct, to the desired level of accuracy, for the systematic errors in the presence\nof noise?\n\u2022 How can we achieve this in a computationally efficient way, given the large number of visibilities that the experiment produces.\n\u2022 What is the theoretical limit on calibration accuracy (expressed via the information theoretic\nCram\u00e9r-Rao bound) and can we reach it in practice?\n\u2022 Is the detection of the EoR signal feasible under the various instrumental distortions, incomplete uv-plane sampling and large noise power?\n\n2. Maximum Likelihood inversion\nIn array signal processing, the problem of estimating the parameters of multiple sources emitting signals that are received is addressed. There are several estimators proposed in the literature,\nbut in this work we focus on the Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimator. The method was pioneered\nby R. A. Fisher in 1922. The maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) selects the parameter value\nwhich gives the observed data the largest possible probability density in the absence of prior information, although the latter can be easily incorporated to make the analysis fully Bayesian. For\n1 We\n\nhave assumed a PSF of three arcminutes, so that 1\u03bcJy/beam corresponds to 2 Kelvin.\n\n2\n\n\fPanos Lampropoulos\n\nStatistical inversion of the LOFAR EoR data\n\nsmall numbers of samples, the bias of maximum likelihood estimators can be substantial, but for\nfairly weak regularity conditions it can be considered asymptotically optimal. Thus, for large samples the MLE has been shown to achieve the Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound and yield asymptotically\nefficient parameter estimates [3]. With large numbers of data points (of the order of 109 contrasted\nto 106 estimated parameters), as in the case of the LOFAR EoR KSP, the bias of the method tends\nto be very small (Central Limit Theorem).\nThis immense amount of data is affected by instrumental corruptions, which will be determined, to first order, during the initial processing. This involves finding a good initial solution\nof the parameters for all instrument and sky effects using a modified SELFCAL loop and a simple model for for the sky (e.g. bright calibrator sources). Solving for the parameters is a highly\nnon-linear process, bound to converge to secondary minima, if not carried out carefully.\nThe data model can be written as a set of linear equations v = A (p) s + n, where v is the observed data vector, A (p) is a sparse matrix describing the instrumental effects, s is the true underlying sky signal and n is a vector representing uncorrelated, spatially white noise. The Maximum\nLikelihood solution to this problem is [2]:\nh\ni\u22121 h\ni\n\u2020\n\u22121\nA\n(p)\nA\n(p)\nC\nsML = A\u2020 (p) C\u22121\nnoise\nnoise v.\nC\u22121\nnoise stands for the inverse covariance matrix of the noise. Solving this equation is essentially a\nlinear algebra problem, but the solution is non-trivial because v is a vector of 109 double-precision,\ncomplex numbers.\n\n3. Regularization\nThe system of linear equations that we described in the previous section cannot be inverted\ndirectly. The resulting system matrix is singular for most practical cases and thus regularization\nhas to be used in order to get an approximate solution that is close to the real one. The regularized\nMaximum Likelihood solution becomes:\n\u0010\n\u0011\nT \u22121\nAT C\u22121\nv\n=\nA\nC\nA\n+\n\u03b1R\ns,\nnoise\nnoise\nwhere \u03b1 is a Lagrange multiplier (regularization parameter) and R is the regularization functional.\nFor the regularization functional we use two methods: Tikhonov and diffusion operators that take\ninto account the local curvature of the data and the measurement equation.\nFigure 1 shows the comparison of the Tikhonov and diffusion regularization methods for final\nmaps for different map resolutions. We see that Tikhonov regularization is particularly harsh on\nsuppressing extreme values. The MLE is performed on the uv-plane and we present the direct\nFourier transform of the visibilities (dirty map). To get statistically optimal results the dynamic\nrange of the data has to be 100:1 or larger.\n\n4. Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound and the power-spectrum\nIn order to demonstrate the potential gain in estimation accuracy of the ML estimator we need\nto evaluate numerically the asymptotic covariance.

The CRB is obtained by applying block-matrix inversion identities.\nIn Figure 2 we present the variance of the noise and the CRB as a function of SNR. In the\n1\ncase of interferometry the SNR scales with the number of data points as N \u2212 2 . Thus we can move\nto the asymptotic convergence regime by either integrating more or increasing the number of stations.We have assumed that we observe for 4 hours per night using 0.5 MHz of bandwidth and 30\nseconds of averaging. This means that within each integration time interval we accumulate \u223c 104\nvisibilities per frequency. The blue line shows the CRB computed from the parameters obtained\nfrom a realistic EoR simulation described in [2]. We then estimate the standard deviation using a\nvarying number of visibilities to generate maps. We see that we approach the CRB for a number\n4\n\n\fPanos Lampropoulos\n\nStatistical inversion of the LOFAR EoR data\n\n800\nm\nCRB\n\nm [mK]\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n5\n5.5\nlog10(Nvis/100)\n\n6\n\n6.5\n\nFigure 2: Bounds on the standard deviation of the signal power.

However, we\nmust raise attention to the following issues: In this work we have ignored RFI and mutual coupling.\nThese effects can add coherent contamination to the observed visibility and that would result in a\nFisher information matrix with less than full-rank. In that case the MLE estimator would not be\nunbiased, although it might exhibit the same asymptotic behavior. The effect is more prominent for\ndipoles and tile correlation that are relatively close to each other, but for stations that are separated\nby a large enough distance this should not be a problem. This issue must be addressed through new,\nmore sophisticated simulations. A Monte-Carlo type simulation is also needed in order to calculate\nthe global FIM.\n4.1 EoR signal extraction\nThe ultimate benchmark of the EoR experiment is set by the ability to extract the cosmological\nHI signal. In this section we perform a simple extraction of the signal using a polynomial fitting\nmethod in the uv-plane [5]. To do that we need to select scales on the uv-plane that are sampled\nfor a large fraction of the available observation bandwidth and with high SNR.\nWe achieve the best fit with a polynomial of 7th or 8th order which is higher than what [5]\nand [6] suggest. This is due to the higher effective noise level that is present in the current simulations. In the aforementioned work the authors did not include the effects of calibration residual\nor the confusion noise and they assumed that the properties of the noise are known to a very high\nprecision. In our case that does not hold true. The effective noise has different components that\nare affected in different ways by the data model and they also have different spatial, temporal and\nfrequency behaviors. One way to quantify the noise properties is to use the difference of successive\nnarrow-channel data. If the frequency resolution is high enough we can assume that the astrophysical signal does not change significantly and that the difference is purely determined by the noise.\nHowever, it is unfeasible to generate simulated data at such a high frequency resolution. To remedy\nthis, we estimate the noise for each of the 128 channels of the simulation using the true underlying\nmaps. We note that for the real observations, we will obtain very narrow frequency channels (10\nkHz) from which we can accurately assess the noise level as function of frequency, time and base5\n\n\fPanos Lampropoulos\n\nStatistical inversion of the LOFAR EoR data\n\n200\n\n150\n\nm\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\n\u00ef50\n120\n\n130\n\n140\n\n150\n160\nFrequency (MHz)\n\n170\n\n180\n\n190\n\nFigure 3: Signal extraction using polynomials on the uv-plane.

We then estimate the PDF of the effective noise using bootstrapping. The result is shown in\nFigure 3.\n\n5. Conclusions\nTo determine the theoretical limits and statistical efficiency of the regularized maximum likelihood inversion, we used a Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound analysis. We have shown that the estimator becomes\nasymptotically efficient in the case of map-making with the LOFAR core and that imaging would\nrequire more than ten times better sensitivity. This is within the grasp of the SKA. Based on our\ncurrent simulations and understanding of the astrophysical and instrumental processes the LOFAR\nEoR experiment should be capable to detect the EoR signal, provided that the calibration can increase the dynamic range of the data with an error of less than 0.1 per cent\n\nReferences\n[1] Furlanetto, S.
