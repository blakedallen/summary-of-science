Introduction\nIf, as suspected by many, there is a short distance cutoff on physical degrees of freedom, then\nas the universe expands the number of degrees of freedom must be growing. Such a scenario\nmight neatly account for the otherwise puzzlingly low initial entropy of the universe, and\nat long wavelengths might be indistinguishable from the usual continuum physics in an\nexpanding background spacetime. But to explore this avenue is difficult, since it raises the\nproblem of formulating dynamics in a setting where the number of degrees of freedom is\nnot the same at each time [1].\nIn the framework of effective field theory (EFT), it is straightforward to describe mode\nbirth. Consider by analogy a growing droplet of liquid. The collective vibrational modes\ndefine an EFT with a cutoff at the atomic scale. As new atoms condense onto the droplet,\nnew modes are added; but at the growing scale, the EFT does not apply. One can work\nin the Fourier transform domain, not with a distance cutoff but with a wavevector cutoff.\nThen EFT modes can be inserted by hand in the adiabatic ground state, but in this\napproach one learns nothing about the microscopic physics associated with growth of the\nmicrostructure of spacetime.\nPerhaps a quantum gravity theory can be formulated in which states with different\nnumbers of degrees of freedom are all contained in the same Hilbert space, so that in the pregeometric sense the number of degrees of freedom is actually constant. Then presumably\nmode birth would be just a feature of the dynamics. This is a deep problem. Here we\ntry to gain some insight by considering what should be a much simpler problem: quantum\nfield theory (QFT) on a background growing, or more generally irregular lattice.\nAn appealing idea for a fundamental discrete, irregular structure is that of a causal\nset [2, 3]. It is an outstanding problem whether and how one might formulate quantum\nfield theory on a causal set. (Some ideas on classical field theory have been worked out\nhowever [4].) This question forms a second motivation for the present work, although the\ncausal sets we consider have two properties not shared by a generic causal set: finite linking\nand a 'layered' structure.\nWe thus wish to consider a simple free scalar field theory model on an irregular lattice\nstructure. The challenge is to formulate a theory that allows for the increase of degrees of\nfreedom, while possessing a good quantum mechanical interpretation and agreeing at long\nwavelengths with standard quantum field theory in an expanding background spacetime.\n1.1 Overview of the approach and results\nIt is by no means clear how to modify quantum field theory to allow for irregular lattices,\nin particular growing ones. One could imagine just writing down an action, and a corresponding path integral. This has been done on random lattices in Euclidean signature,\nand the path integral can be given there a statistical probability interpretation. But in\nthe Lorentzian context, without the usual underlying Hamiltonian structure there is no\nguarantee that the complex amplitudes so defined would have any consistent probability\ninterpretation at all. For example the transition amplitudes would in no sense be unitary.\nOne could try to use the decoherence functional approach, rather than demanding strict\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\funitarity. In fact just such an approach was explored in [5] in a very general setting of evolution on causal networks. But there is no guarantee that useful sets of decohering histories\ncould be found in such a general setting. Abstract formulations of quantum dynamics on\ncausal sets have also been developed[6, 7], but without direct relation to the dynamics of\nany particular field theory. For the present work the aim is simply to recover the quantum\nfield theory of a linear field in the large, so we prefer to stay closer to a local Hamiltonian\nformulation, adopting the algebraic approach to QFT[8, 9]. It may be that for the class\nof lattices considered here, the path integral approach does make sense, but we have not\ninvestigated that question.\nThe algebraic approach has for ingredients a C \u2217 -algebra and a state. For example,\nthe algebra might be generated by the abstract quantum field \"operator\" satisfying a field\nequation and canonical commutation relations, and the state is a positive linear functional\non the algebra that assigns expectation values to observables. The conservation of a symplectic structure under evolution from one time slice to the next plays a critical role in the\nway both of these structures are usually defined in practice. The equation of motion must\nbe compatible with the commutation relations, a property whose validity derives ultimately\nfrom the conserved symplectic form in phase space. And candidate states are defined as\nelements of the Fock space built over a one particle Hilbert space whose inner product also\nderives from the conserved symplectic form.\nWhile we can loosen the form of the equation of motion, it is difficult to know where\nto begin if we do not maintain the existence of a conserved symplectic form. Thus, at least\nfor now, we restrict to irregular lattices that nevertheless possess a time layering so that\nthe dynamical connection between points proceeds systematically from one time slice to\nthe next, allowing a conserved symplectic form to be defined.\nEven when there is a conserved symplectic form, the equation of motion we write will\ngenerally not admit an initial value formulation, as evolution from initial data may not\nbe unique or may not exist in general. This is inevitable when the number of field points\nand/or their connectivity is not conserved from one time to the next, since there can be\neither too few or too many equations to determine the subsequent values. One of the\ninteresting questions is just how far such behavior can be tolerated.\nIn order to implement the commutation relation and define the Hilbert space in a\nstraightforward way we restrict the lattice so that a linear phase space consisting of solutions to the field equation can be defined. This requires that backwards evolution, if it\nexists, is unique. To include all observables of interest, it is necessary to allow for 'birth\nsolutions' that come into existence at a finite time, i.e. that cannot be evolved backwards\npast a certain time. With all of this structure we find it possible to realize the algebraicallydefined quantum field theory in a way that preserves the equations of motion, has canonical\ncommutation relations, and allows for mode birth. The ambiguity of future evolution is\nincorporated naturally into this structure and does not present any fundamental problem.\nWe also construct a Fock representation of the algebra, with the help of a particular rule\nfor resolving the evolution ambiguity. The Fock representation depends on this rule, but all\nsuch representations are equivalent, and the theory is fully defined by the algebra without\nthe choice of any such rule. The state of the newborn modes is not specified by the earlier\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fdata so is extra information not available at an earlier time.\nWe study here particle creation in a 1+1 dimensional example, assuming the usual\nvacuum on an early time regular lattice and examining the spectrum of created particles\nin a late time regular lattice after points have been added. Considering all states subject\nto the restriction that there are no incoming particles, we arrive at the conclusion that,\nroughly speaking, one Planck unit of energy is injected per Planck volume (really length\nin the 2d model) created. This calculation serves to illustrate that the theory has been\ndefined well enough to carry out such a computation. But it also suggests that we have\nnot achieved a viable theory: it would be incompatible with the observed universe to have\nso much energy injected. We return to this issue in the discussion section.\nOther approaches to the problem of formulating mode birth in an expanding universe\nhave been explored recently. Kempf [10] has constructed a theory of fields with finite\ndensity of states, derived by representing a deformed uncertainty relation between position\nand momentum which implements a minimum spatial uncertainty. A quadratic scalar\nfield Lagrangian written with this deformed momentum operator produces a field equation\nwhose mode solutions are born at a definite time. The modes cannot be evolved backward\nbefore the birth time, because the differential equation they satisfy is singular at that time.\nThis is closely analogous to what occurs in our discrete model. Unlike our case however,\nforward evolution is not ambiguous.\nIn a very different approach, Sasakura [11] formulates discrete field theory of scalars,\nspinors, and gauge fields, on a growing fuzzy 2-sphere. At each discrete time N the scalar\nfield is an hermitian operator on the representation space of the spin-N/2 representation\nof su(2), and the fields \u03c6N +1 , \u03c6N , and \u03c6N \u22121 are related by a discrete analog of the wave\nequation. The classical scalar field equation in an expanding universe with proper time N\n\u221a\nand scale factor N + 1 is recovered in a large N , low spin limit. The initial value problem\nis not discussed, but it seems that the field equation does not determine \u03c6N +1 from \u03c6N and\n\u03c6N \u22121 . We would guess that there are also birth solutions. The quantum interpretation of\nthis theory is not yet entirely clear (at least to us). Both of these approaches share the\nfeature that a short distance cutoff exists without sacrificing spatial symmetry, unlike in\nour rather more crude approach.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the lattice structure\nadopted, and section 3 formulates the action and field equation, as well as the phase\nspace description. The ingredients then allow straightforward quantization, as described in\nsection 4. In section 5 we work out the example of quantization on a regular 'hyperdiamond'\nlattice, and section 6 deals with the example of a two-dimensional lattice that grows by the\naddition of two points. In particular we construct a Fock space representation and examine\nthe resulting particle creation. A discussion of the results, some perspectives, and ideas\nfor future work are given in section 7. An appendix contains formulae for the Bogoliubov\ncoefficients in the two-dimensional example. We adopt the metric signature (+\u2212\u2212\u2212) and\nuse units with the speed of light c = 1.\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\f2. Lattice structure\nWe use a type of lattice that is a special kind of causal set [2, 3]. This choice allows the\ndiscrete structure to carry the metric information in its topology, with no length assignments. To make the field theory action finite, we restrict to the case where each point p\nhas a finite number of causal neighbors, i.e. points q such that there is no point between\np and q in the sense of the causal order. We denote by IF (p) the set of future causal\nneighbors, the immediate future. Similarly IP (p) refers to the immediate past. These sets\nare thought of as discrete analogs of a cross section of the future and past light cone in the\ntangent space at a point in the continuum. A pair of causal neighbors is called a link, so\nthe structure could be called a finitely linked causal set.\nWe choose to preserve symmetry among the future links at a point, in the sense that\nour field theory action is unchanged when they are permuted. In the continuum limit\nthis amounts to treating the future links as spacetime vectors of identical length and\nwith identical pairwise inner products. Unlike the standard interpretation of the ordering\nrelation in causal sets, the links will correspond to spacelike rather than null vectors (except\nin two dimensions), although the convex hull spanned by these vectors will have null faces.\nThe action and equation of motion will be well defined on the minimal structure of a\nfinitely linked causal set. But to make progress on the quantum field theory, as discussed\nin the introduction, we shall require that the lattice be layered by time slices: the lattice\nwill consist of an indexed sequence {Sn } of sets of points called slices, such that every point\nlies in exactly one slice Sn , and links connect points in slice Sn only to points in Sn\u22121 or\nSn+1 .1\nWe will use the letters i, j to index elements pi \u2208 IF (p) and pi \u2208 IP (p) with no\nimplication that the number of elements in any of these sets is equal. Multiple indices are\nalso allowed, thus for example\npi j := (pi )j \u2208 IF (IP (p)).\n\n(2.1)\n\nNote that the index order matters: pj i \u2208 IP (IF (p)) is generally not equal to pi j . One\ncalls pi a child and pi a parent of p. Then pi j is a sibling while pj i is a mate. All manner\nof polygamy and incest is permitted by the layered structure, provided it is not crossgenerational.\nTo carry out the quantization in close analogy with linear quantum fields in the continuum, we will make one further restriction on the lattice structure: backward-in-time\nevolution using the field equation we adopt, if it exists, is unique.\n2.1 Hyperdiamond lattice\nThe regular prototype of the lattices we will consider is a d-dimensional hypercubical spacetime lattice tilted on its vertex so that a preferred time-like direction runs from one corner\nof the cube to the complete opposite. We call this the hyperdiamond lattice after the\n1\n\nIn the causal set literature a \"slice\" refers to a maximal set of unrelated points. Our slices here consist\nof unrelated points, but they need not be maximal. For example the points e and f in Fig. 1 are unrelated\nto points on the previous slices, so the latter are not maximal.\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fterminology of Ref. [12, 13]. A step along one lattice link runs along one of the cube's\nedges, and represents a movement in the preferred time-like direction and a movement in\nthe orthogonal space to one of the d vertices of a (d \u2212 1)-dimensional tetrahedron centered\non the original point. The lattice thus possesses a tetrahedral rotation symmetry.\nWe choose the step-speed so that the future continuum light cone at a point lies inside\nand tangent to the polyhedron formed by the set of future links. With this choice the\nhyperplane faces of the polyhedral cone are null hyperplanes and the links are spacelike.\nThis determines the step speed as follows.\nThe d link vectors nai are given by\nnai = ta + \u03b1sai\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere ta is a unit timelike vector along the hypercube diagonal and, for each i, sai is a\nspatial unit vector orthogonal to ta pointing to one of the vertices of a (d \u2212 1)-dimensional\nP\ntetrahedron. By tetrahedral symmetry, the sum i sai must vanish. If the cube faces are\nto be null, then their normal vector must lie within them and must be a null vector. Again\nP\nby tetrahedral symmetry this normal for the face omitting nai must be the sum j6=i naj\nof the d \u2212 1 link vectors defining the face. Since the d spatial vectors sum to zero this is\nequal to (d \u2212 1)ta \u2212 \u03b1sai , which is null provided \u03b1 = d \u2212 1. Hence the link step speed is\nd \u2212 1, which is the speed of light only in two spacetime dimensions.\nP\nSquaring the relation i sai = 0 reveals the spacetime inner products of the spatial\nvectors, sai sja = 1/(d \u2212 1) for i 6= j. With our signature, the spatial inner products have\nthe opposite sign, so the cosine of the angle between any two is \u22121/(d \u2212 1). The inverse\nspacetime metric can be expressed in terms of the link vectors as\nX\n1\ng ab =\nnai nbj .\n(2.3)\nd(d \u2212 1)\ni6=j\n\nAn equivalent description of the hyperdiamond lattice is obtained beginning with a\nsystem of d null coordinates v i , i.e. coordinates whose level sets are null hyperplanes, such\nthat the metric is invariant under permutations of these coordinates. The corresponding\nbasis one-forms dv i are null, and the dual basis vectors (\u2202/\u2202v i )a are equal to the nai defined\nP\nin (2.2), when the v i are scaled so that t = i v i is a proper time coordinate. Discretizing\nthe v i then yields the lattice.\nThe d-dimensional hyperdiamond lattice can be compactified to have spatial sections\nthat are (d \u2212 1)-tori. Consider for illustration the case d = 4. Then the immediate future\nof any point is a tetrahedron. Translation along any edge of the tetrahedron is clearly\na symmetry of the hyperdiamond lattice, since every point is equivalent. We can thus\nidentify the points related by any integer number of such translations along three edges at\none vertex to obtain a 3-torus. One can also compactify to \"twisted tori\", or even Klein\nbottles.\n\n3. Lattice dynamics\nA continuum massless, minimally coupled scalar field in d spacetime dimensions has the\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\faction\nS=\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\ndd x \u2212gg ab \u2202a \u03c6\u2202b \u03c6.\n\n(3.1)\n\nWe first discretize this on a hyperdiamond lattice, then use the result to motivate an action\non an irregular lattice. After discussing the resulting equations of motion, we introduce a\nphase space and symplectic form to be used in the quantization.\n3.0.1 Hyperdiamond lattice action\nGiven a hyperdiamond lattice with edge links \u01ebnai scaled by a small length \u01eb, we insert the\nmetric decomposition (2.3) in the action (3.1) and replace the partial derivatives by finite\ndifferences\n\u01ebnai \u2202a \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6(p + \u01ebni ) \u2212 \u03c6(p).\n(3.2)\nThis yields the discrete action\nSreg = V (d) \u01ebd\u22122 12\n\nX\np\ni6=j\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n\u03c6(pi ) \u2212 \u03c6(p) \u03c6(pj ) \u2212 \u03c6(p) ,\nd(d \u2212 1)\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere V (d) \u01ebd is the spacetime volume of one hypercubical cell of the lattice, and pi denotes\nthe point future-linked to p in the direction nai .\nOne could instead use the past links rather than the future links, or even a combination\nof the two, in the discrete action. We use the future links for no good reason.\n3.0.2 Irregular lattice action\nUsing the regular case (3.3) as a guide, we posit an action for a scalar field on a general\ncausal lattice. We cannot copy that exactly at each point p, since the number of points\ndp in the immediate future IF (p) varies from point to point, hence different powers of\nthe dimensionful quantity \u01eb appear. Our definition of the discrete theory simply ignores\nthe powers of \u01eb and the volume factor V (d) that goes along with them. We preserve the\ndenominator dp (dp \u2212 1), which corresponds to the number of terms in the sum, so that the\naction at p is always the average of the products of the differences along the future links\nat p. With these choices, the irregular lattice action we adopt is\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011\nX\n1\n\u03c6(pi ) \u2212 \u03c6(p) \u03c6(pj ) \u2212 \u03c6(p) .\n(3.4)\nSirreg = 21\np dp (dp \u2212 1)\ni6=j\n\n3.1 Discrete field equations\nVarying the field in the irregular lattice action (3.4) one obtains the discrete field equation\n\u2737\u03c6 = 0,\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhere the discrete D'Alembertian operator \u2737 is defined by\n\u2737\u03c6(p) = \u2212\u03c6(p) +\n\nX 1\nX\nX 1\n1\n\u03c6(pi j ).\n\u03c6(pi ) +\n\u03c6(pi ) \u2212\ndp\ndpi\ndpi (dpi \u2212 1)\ni\n\ni\n\ni,j\npi j 6=p\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n(3.6)\n\n\fIn the regular case, the D'Alembertian is the average over the children, plus the average\nover the parents, minus the average over the siblings, minus the value of the field at\np. It does not have this interpretation in the general case, because the weights of the\nparent and sibling terms are different. It can be rewritten to look more like the continuum\nD'Alembertian \u2202t2 \u2212 \u22072 :\n\u0011 X 1 \u0010\n\u0011 X\n\u0010\n\u0011\nX 1 \u0010\n1\n\u03c6(pi ) \u2212 \u03c6(p) \u2212\n\u03c6(p) \u2212 \u03c6(pi ) \u2212\n\u03c6(pi j ) \u2212 \u03c6(p) . (3.7)\ndp\ndpi\ndpi (dpi \u2212 1)\ni\n\ni\n\ni,j\n\nIn the regular case the first two sums are the average future and past time-differences, so\ntheir difference gives a discrete version of the second time derivative. The third sum is the\naverage of the spatial neighbors minus the value at p, which is a discrete version of the\nspatial Laplacian.\n3.2 Initial value problem\nThe field equation (3.5,3.6) involves values of the field on three consecutive time slices. The\nequation that arises from varying \u03c6(p) on the middle slice determines the average value on\nIF (p) given the values on the first two slices. If the number of points on the middle and\nthird slice is N2 and N3 respectively, then one has N2 linear equations in the N3 unknown\nvalues on the third slice. Supposing N2 and N3 are finite, the future solution is not uniquely\ndetermined if N3 > N2 , and there is generically no future solution if N3 < N2 . Existence\nof a future solution when N3 \u2265 N2 depends upon the connectivity of the lattice.\nAn example we shall make use of is a two-dimensional regular diamond lattice, where\neach point has two parents and two children, and periodic boundary conditions are imposed\nso that at each time there is a total of N points arranged on a circle. The field equation\ndetermines the sum of the values on each adjacent pair of points, so if N is even (or infinite)\nthe evolution is determined only up to the addition of a spatially-alternating function with\narbitrary time-dependence. If N is odd the evolution is uniquely determined since the periodicity is inconsistent with the alternation. It is possible to regard the alternating functions\nin the even or infinite cases as \"pure gauge\", and to formulate a corresponding dynamics\nof the gauge-invariant degrees of freedom, but we shall avoid this extra complication by\nrequiring N to be odd in the two-dimensional example we study.\nNote that even if the number of points on each slice is the same, the equations could be\nover-determined so that no future solution would exist. For example this could happen if\nthe future of some set of points on one slice contains fewer points on the next slice. But even\nif these numbers match there could still be trouble. Consider the two-dimensional example\njust discussed in the case that N is even. The equations take the form \u03c6(i) + \u03c6(i + 1) = Hi ,\nwith i = 1, . . . , N and \u03c6(N + 1) \u2261 \u03c6(1). The sum of the left hand sides of the odd-i\nequations is equal to the sum of the even-i ones. (For example, with N = 4 one has\n[\u03c6(1) + \u03c6(2)] + [\u03c6(3) + \u03c6(4)] = [\u03c6(2) + \u03c6(3)] + [\u03c6(4) + \u03c6(1)].) This implies that there can be\nP\nP\na solution only if the condition odd Hi = even Hi holds. It happens that this condition\nis automatic if the lattice is a regular diamond lattice, but it could fail to hold on a lattice\nwith altered connectivity prior to the slice in question.\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\f3.3 Phase space of half-solutions\nSince initial data cannot in general be evolved indefinitely or uniquely, it is not convenient\nto define a phase space in terms of initial data. Instead one can try to use the covariant\napproach that identifies phase space as the space of solutions.2 This takes care of nonuniqueness of evolution, as two distinct evolutions simply correspond to different points in\nphase space. Non-existence of evolution is another matter.\nOne might try to associate to each region a different phase space, consisting of the\nsolutions that are defined everywhere in that region. This idea may be compatible with\nthat of a net of local algebras on which the algebraic formulation of QFT is based[8].\nAnother approach might be to introduce just one phase space, without a linear structure.\nBut, for this initial investigation, we choose to exploit the linear structure of a single phase\nspace in strict analogy with standard linear quantum field theory. Thus we seek a definition\nof phase space as a single vector space. In particular, we require an operation of addition\nof two solutions that defines an abelian group, i.e. that is commutative, associative, and\npossesses an identity and an inverse. This requirement leads to further demands on the\npartial solutions and lattice structure.\nLet \u03c6(s..t) denote a solution that exists between the discrete times s and t and is\nundefined outside that interval. The additive inverse of \u03c6(s..t) must surely be \u2212\u03c6(s..t),\nbut these two functions are defined only on the interval [s, t], whereas the identity must be\nthe zero solution which exists for all time. We thus learn that the operation of addition\nmust include a maximal extrapolation (using the field equation) beyond the original range\nof definition of the sum. However, since evolution is generally not unique, extrapolation is\nnot well-defined. To cope with this we restrict to lattices for which backward evolution, if it\nexists, is unique, and we define the phase space to consist of solutions that are defined for\nall time, together with solutions that are defined on a semi-infinite interval3 [t, \u221e). These\nlatter we call half-solutions with birth time t. On this space, the operation of \"sum on the\ncommon domain, then maximally extend to the past\" defines an abelian group. To see\nthat this is associative consider (a + b) + c and a + (b + c). In the region where a, b, and\nc are all individually defined these sums are both equal to the standard sum a + b + c.\nGlobally, they are both the maximal past extension of this sum, hence they are equal.\nAs noted in section (3.2), there is no guarantee that all-or even any-initial data can\nbe extended indefinitely into the future. Despite this we can define the phase space using\nthe half-solutions. If there are none, then the theory is empty.\n3.4 Symplectic form\nIn a general Hamiltonian context, a symplectic form \u03a9 on phase space is a non-degenerate\nclosed two-form [9]. For a linear phase space \u0393 the tangent space at a point is naturally\nidentified with the phase space itself, so \u03a9 can be treated as a map from \u0393 \u00d7 \u0393 to the real\nnumbers. In the present application, \u03a9 maps pairs of half-solutions to numbers.\n2\n\nSee [9] for an introduction to the covariant phase space formalism and its application to quantization\nof linear field theory.\n3\nThe theory could also be set up using solutions defined on intervals of the form [t, t0 ], where t0 is a\nfixed finite time.\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\fTo motivate the discrete version, recall first how it works in the continuum. For a\nreal Klein\u2013Gordon field in D-dimensional space-time, the symplectic product between two\nsolutions \u03c8 and \u03c6 is defined by\nZ\n\u0001\n\u03c8 \u2202a \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6\u2202a \u03c8 d\u03a3a ,\n(3.8)\n\u03a9 (\u03c8, \u03c6) =\nS\n\nwhere S is a Cauchy surface. This product is well-defined on the covariant phase space since\nit takes the same value when evaluated on any surface S provided the field equations are\nsatisfied. A simple way to verify this fact is to integrate the expression \u03c8\u2737\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6\u2737\u03c8, which\nvanishes by virtue of the field equation, over a space-time region between two Cauchy\nsurfaces. This integrand is the total divergence \u2207a (\u03c8 \u2202a \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6\u2202a \u03c8), hence the volume\nintegral is equal to the difference of (3.8) between the final and initial surfaces (assuming\nno contribution from a spatial boundary). Since the volume integral vanishes, the two\nspatial integrals must be equal.\nThe same construction works in the discrete case, with \u2737 replaced by the discrete\nversion (3.6). The sum of \u03c6\u2737\u03c8 \u2212 \u03c8\u2737\u03c6 over a sequence of slices reduces by cancellations to\na pair of boundary contributions on the initial and final slices (assuming no contribution\nfrom a spatial boundary). This shows that the discrete symplectic form\n\u03a9(\u03c8, \u03c6) =\n\nX 1\n\u0001\n\u03c8(p)\u03c6(pi ) \u2212 \u03c6(p)\u03c8(pi )\ndp\n\n(3.9)\n\np\u2208S; i\n\ntakes the same value when computed on any slice S in the domain of definition of two\nsolutions \u03c8 and \u03c6 to the discrete field equation. It is thus well-defined on phase space. On\na spatially infinite lattice some kind of falloff condition on the fields would be required to\nensure that the infinite sum defining the symplectic form converges.\n3.4.1 Degeneracy\nThe symplectic form for the continuum Klein\u2013Gordon field is non-degenerate, i.e. \u03a9(\u03c8, *) =\n0 only if \u03c8 = 0. This is not necessarily true on the lattice. For example, suppose A is any\nspatially alternating configuration on a two-dimensional periodic even diamond lattice.\nThen, as discussed in section 3.2, A satisfies the field equation. It is thus an element\nof the phase space, so \u03a9(A, *) is well defined, and is in fact equal to zero. Whenever a\nsymplectic form has a vector field Y for which \u03a9(Y, *) = 0, the Hamiltonian vector field\nXH is determined by Hamilton's equations dH = \u03a9(*, XH ) only up to addition of an\narbitrary multiple of Y . In the present case, this corresponds to the statement that to\nany solution \u03c6 one can add an arbitrary spatially-alternating configuration to obtain a\nnew solution with the same initial data. This indeterminacy is a gauge freedom, and the\nphysical phase space is the quotient of the solution space modulo the gauge freedom.\n3.5 Poisson brackets\nThe symplectic form, if not degenerate, provides the definition of Poisson brackets between\nany two phase space observables, i.e. functions on phase space. Given two such functions\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\ff and g, the Poisson bracket is a third function defined by\n{f, g} = \u03a9ab \u2202a f \u2202b g.\n\n(3.10)\n\nHere we use (abstract) index notation, and \u03a9ab is the inverse of the symplectic form \u03a9ab ,\ndefined by \u03a9ab \u03a9bc = \u03b4ca .\nIn the linear case, to each phase space point \u03c6 is associated the linear observable whose\nvalue at \u03c8 is \u03a9(\u03c6, \u03c8) = \u03a9ma \u03c6m \u03c8 a . This function has the gradient \u2202a \u03a9(\u03c6, *) = \u03a9ma \u03c6m ;\ntherefore\n{\u03a9(\u03c8, *), \u03a9(\u03c6, *)} = \u2212\u03a9(\u03c8, \u03c6).\n(3.11)\nIt is this relation that we quantize. If \u03a9 is degenerate, an algebra of gauge-invariant\nobservables can be defined directly by the relation (3.11), which does not involve the\ninverse of \u03a9.\n3.5.1 Local fields and locality\nThough not central to our study, we shall make a few remarks here about local observables\nand their Poisson brackets. This section can be omitted without missing anything essential\nto the central focus of our paper.\nFirst, note that evaluation of solutions at a lattice point x defines a linear map \u03c6 \u2192\n\u03c6(x) only on those half-solutions whose birth time lies before x. Since this map is not\ndefined on the entire phase space it is not strictly speaking an observable. The Poisson\nbracket {\u03c6(x), \u03c6(y)} is thus not globally defined on the phase space, but it should be\nmeaningful locally in phase space.\nTo discuss the locality in space-time of the Poisson brackets, let us restrict to the case\nof a compact d-dimensional hyperdiamond lattice, chosen so that evolution from initial\ndata always exists and is unique. Then the local field \u03c6(x) is an observable. We call this\na deterministic lattice.\nIn the continuum, the Poisson bracket of two local fields is given by\n{\u03c6(x), \u03c6(y)} = GR (x, y) \u2212 GA (x, y),\n\n(3.12)\n\nwhere GR and GA are the retarded and advanced Green's functions of the Klein\u2013Gordon\nequation. If x and y are spacelike related this bracket vanishes. On the lattice (in greater\nthan two dimensions) the links are spacelike, so we do not expect the bracket to vanish at\nall spacelike separations. However, not even a lattice locality property survives, as we now\nexplain.\nOn a deterministic lattice \u03a9 is necessarily invertible,4 so there exists a solution Fx such\nthat\n\u03c6(x) = \u03a9(Fx , \u03c6).\n(3.13)\n4\n\nIf A is a solution such that \u03a9(A, *) = 0, then the future and past averages of A must vanish at every\npoint. The field equation (3.5,3.6) then implies that A = 0, unless d = 2. In the case d = 2, uniqueness\nof evolution requires an odd number of points on each slice, which together with the vanishing of averages\nimplies A = 0.\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\fEvaluating on the slice Sx , one sees that in order for Eq. (3.13) to hold for all \u03c6, the\nsolution Fx must vanish everywhere on the slice Sx containing x, have a mean value of \u22121\non IF (x), and have a mean value of zero on IF (v) for every other point v in the slice Sx .\nThe bracket of local fields is thus\n{\u03c6(x), \u03c6(y)} = \u2212\u03a9(Fx , Fy ) = \u2212Fy (x).\n\n(3.14)\n\nThe second equality follows immediately from the defining property (3.13) of Fx . If x\nand y lie on the same slice then Fy (x) = 0, so the equal-time bracket vanishes, as in the\ncontinuum. If y lies on the subsequent slice, we need to use the field equation to evolve\nFy back one step to the slice Sx in order to evaluate Fy (x). The field equation (3.5,3.6)\non Sy implies that the average of Fy on IP (y) is +1 and the average on IP (w) vanishes\nfor every other point w in the slice Sy . On a hyperdiamond lattice this clearly forces Fy\nto have support on Sx arbitrarily far from y, hence there will be many such pairs x, y for\nwhich Fy (x) 6= 0.\nThis nonlocality of the bracket (3.14) survives quantization, so it implies arbitrarily\nspacelike distant observables fail to commute. It is not clear that this is really a problem,\nhowever, since the average of field values on each IF (x) may have purely local brackets.\nThis average corresponds to the observable \u03a9(\u03b4x , *), where \u03b4x is equal to 1 at x and vanishes\neverywhere else on the slice Sx containing x and the subsequent slice. That is, we have\n1X\n\u03c6(xi ) = \u03a9(\u03b4x , \u03c6),\nd\n\n(3.15)\n\ni\n\nso the bracket of two such local averages is\nn1 X\nd\n\ni\n\n\u03c6(xi ),\n\no\n1X\n1X\n\u03c6(y j ) = \u2212\u03a9(\u03b4x , \u03b4y ) = \u2212\n\u03b4y (xi ).\nd\nd\nj\n\n(3.16)\n\ni\n\nUnlike for Fx , the data defining \u03b4x is localized. Since the field equation (3.5,3.6) is local\nthis means that the support of the solution \u03b4x might propagate \"causally\" away from x\nto the future and the past. If so, then the bracket of the averages is non-zero only if x\nand y are causally related in the sense determined by the local field equation. On an odd\ntwo-dimensional lattice the propagation of \u03b4x is indeed causal. We do not know if that\nproperty holds in higher dimensions.\n\n4. Quantization\nTo quantize one replaces the classical observable \u03a9(\u03c8, *) by an element \u03a9\u0302(\u03c8, *) of a C \u2217 algebra possessing the canonical commutation relations (CCR),\nh\ni\n\u03a9\u0302 (\u03c6, *) , \u03a9\u0302 (\u03c8, *) = \u2212i~\u03a9 (\u03c6, \u03c8) 1\u0302,\n(4.1)\nand such that \u03a9\u0302(\u03c8, *)\u2217 = \u03a9\u0302(\u03c8, *). (Hereafter we set ~ = 1.) The quantum theory is then\ncompleted with the choice of a state, i.e. a linear functional \u03c9 on this algebra satisfying the\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\fpositivity condition \u03c9(a\u2217 a) \u2265 0, with a an arbitrary algebra element, and the normalization\ncondition \u03c9(1) = 1. This notion of state adapts the concept of a density matrix to the\nmost general setting.\nHere we follow the simple conventional procedure of constructing the class of states by\nrepresenting the algebra as operators on a Fock space. The Fock space is built over a \"oneparticle\" Hilbert space which is defined using the Klein\u2013Gordon inner product between\ncomplex solutions to the classical field equation:\nh\u03c8, \u03c6i = i\u03a9(\u03c8\u0304, \u03c6) = i\n\nX 1\n\u0001\n\u03c8\u0304(p)\u03c6(pi ) \u2212 \u03c6(p)\u03c8\u0304(pi ) .\ndp\n\n(4.2)\n\np\u2208S; i\n\nThe definition (3.9) of \u03a9 is extended here by complex linearity to the space of complex\nsolutions to the field equation. Although this is not a positive-definite inner product it can\nbe used to construct the Hilbert space as follows.\nChoose a positive-norm subspace which is orthogonal to its conjugate, and which\ntogether with its conjugate spans the space of solutions. Let {\u03bei , \u03be\u0304i } be an orthonormal\nbasis adapted to this decomposition, so that\nh\u03bei , \u03bej i = \u03b4ij = \u2212h\u03be\u0304i , \u03be \u0304j i,\n\nh\u03bei , \u03be \u0304j i = 0,\n\n(4.3)\n\nand define the field operator \u03c6\u0302 as\n\u03c6\u0302 =\n\nX\ni\n\n\u0001\n\u03bei ai + \u03be\u0304i a\u2020i ,\n\n(4.4)\n\n[ai , aj ] = 0 = [a\u2020i , a\u2020j ].\n\n(4.5)\n\nwhere\n[ai , a\u2020j ] = \u03b4ij ,\n\nThen the commutation relations (4.1) are satisfied if the quantized linear observables are\nrepresented by\n\u0002\n\nX\n\u0003\n\u0001\n\u03a9\u0302(\u03c8, *) rep = i\u03a9(\u03c8, \u03c6\u0302) = i\n\u03a9(\u03c8, \u03bei )ai + \u03a9(\u03c8, \u03be \u0304i )a\u2020i .\n\n(4.6)\n\ni\n\nThe 'Fock vacuum' state |0i is defined by the condition ai |0i = 0 for all i, and the Fock\nspace is the Hilbert space spanned by all finite norm vectors obtained by acting on |0i with\nproducts of the raising operators a\u2020i . The field operator (4.4) is self-adjoint acting on the\nFock space, as befits a real field. The state vectors of the theory are the elements of Fock\nspace, while the algebraic states are density matrices constructed therefrom.\nThe construction in the last paragraph depends upon the basis {\u03bei , \u03be \u0304i }, but on a spatially finite lattice the representation of the algebra is independent of this choice. This\nfollows from the Stone\u2013Von-Neumann theorem, which states that all representations of\nthe canonical commutation relations for a finite dimensional phase space are unitarily\nequivalent[9].\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\f5. QFT on a hyperdiamond lattice\nIn this section we work out the example of a toroidally compactified hyperdiamond lattice,\nbeginning with the classical fields and then quantizing. We initially consider an arbitrary\ndimension d. We find that the discrete field equation has exponentially growing modes\nexcept in two dimensions. In the next section we use these results in the two-dimensional\ncase to determine the particle creation on a growing lattice.\n5.1 Hyperdiamond modes\nWe can use the harmonic modes\ni\n\n\u03b7k = Nk e\u2212iki v ,\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhere v i are the null coordinates discussed at the end of section 2.1, and Nk is a normalization factor. We adopt units with the lattice spacing \u01eb = 1, so one future link on the lattice\ncorresponds to adding unity to one of the d null coordinates v i . The toroidal boundary\nconditions select a set of allowed wave vectors ki .\nInserting into the field equation (3.5,3.6) yields the dispersion relation\n0 = \u22121 +\n\nX\n1\n1 X \u2212iki 1 X iki\ne\n+\ne \u2212\nei(ki \u2212kj ) .\nd\nd\nd(d \u2212 1)\ni\n\ni\n\n(5.2)\n\ni6=j\n\nP\nFor small ki (compared to 1/\u01eb) this reduces to i6=j ki kj = 0, which says that ki is a null\nvector. That is, the continuum dispersion relation is recovered in this limit. The special\ncases where all but one of the ki vanish are exact solutions both on the lattice and in the\ncontinuum. These are plane waves whose constant phase surfaces are level sets of one of\nthe d null coordinates.\nIf the mode is written as exp(\u2212i\u03c9t + i~k * ~x), the frequency \u03c9 and spatial wave vector\n~k are related to ki via\nki = \u03c9 \u2212 (d \u2212 1)~k * \u015di ,\n(5.3)\nwhere the unit vectors \u015di point to the corners of the spatial tetrahedron (see discussion in\nsection 2.1). We do not assume \u03c9 is real since we wish to discover whether or not there\nare modes that grow or decay exponentially with time. However, as in the continuum, we\nrestrict to real spatial wavevectors.\nFor general ki the dispersion relation (5.2) can be expressed as\n\u03a3(k) + \u03a3(\u2212k) =\n\nd\u03a3(k)\u03a3(\u2212k) + d \u2212 2\n,\nd\u22121\n\nwhere\n\u03a3(k) =\n\n1 X iki\ne .\nd\n\n(5.4)\n\n(5.5)\n\ni\n\nIn terms of frequency and spatial wavevector \u03a3 can be factored as\n\u03a3(\u03c9, ~k) = ei\u03c9 z(~k),\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n(5.6)\n\n\fwhere\n\n1 X \u2212i(d\u22121)~k*\u015di\nz(~k) =\ne\n.\nd\n\n(5.7)\n\ni\n\nUsing the polar form z(~k) = rei\u03b8 , the dispersion relation (5.4) becomes\ncos(\u03c9 + \u03b8) =\n\ndr 2 + d \u2212 2\n.\n2(d \u2212 1)r\n\n(5.8)\n\nSince the spatial vector is assumed real, 0 \u2264 r \u2264 1.\nIn the two-dimensional case (5.8) reduces to cos \u03c9 = cos k, where k now refers to the\nspatial wavevector. If cos k 6= 0 the general solution is \u03c9 = \u00b1k, as in the continuum,\ncorresponding to right and left moving modes. Equivalently, k2 = 0 or k1 = 0. If cos k = 0,\nthen the division by r in going from (5.4) to (5.8) is disallowed, and in fact k = \u00b1\u03c0/2 is also\na solution for any value of \u03c9. These are spatially alternating modes, since the spatial step\nlength is 2\u01eb. They are the pure gauge solutions discussed in Sec. 3.2, which are excluded\non a periodic lattice with an odd number of points.\nIf the dimension d is greater than two, then the right hand side of (5.8) is a positive\nfunction that is concave upward and diverges as r goes to zero or infinity. This function\nis less than unity only for (d \u2212 2)/d < r < 1. When the wavevector is small, compared to\nthe inverse lattice spacing, r is close to unity, so the frequency is real. If it is possible to\nchoose ~k so that r < (d \u2212 2)/d, then there will exist a complex solution to (5.8), implying\nthe existence of exponentially growing or decaying modes with wavelengths of order the\nlattice spacing. We have not tried to determine whether there exist boundary conditions\nthat exclude such modes, but we now show by an example that they can exist.\nTo simplify the computations we choose the spatial wavevector to be orthogonal to\n\u015di for i \u2265 3, so it has the form \u03b1(\u015d1 \u2212 \u015d2 ) for some constant \u03b1. We then find z(~k) =\n[(d \u2212 2)/d] + (2/d) cos \u03b1d. Hence r = |z| < (d \u2212 2)/d if cos \u03b1d is negative. For such values\nof \u03b1, the mode is unstable.\nOn a compact lattice, such a mode must satisfy periodic boundary conditions. Consider\na toroidal compactification of the lattice as described at the end of Sec. 2.1, with identification after N lattice translations in each of the (d \u2212 1) directions \u015di \u2212 \u015d1 for i = 2, . . . d. The\nlattice step with i = 2 for example is given by (v 1 , v 2 , v 3 , . . . , v d ) \u2192 (v 1 \u22121, v 2 +1, v 3 , . . . , v d ).\nIn order for the mode function to be periodic after N steps in each of these directions, its\nwavevector must satisfy ki \u2212 k1 = (d \u2212 1)~k * (\u015d1 \u2212 \u015di ) = 2\u03c0ni /N . With the above form of ~k,\nthese periodicity conditions reduce to 2\u03b1d = 2\u03c0n2 /N , and \u03b1d = 2\u03c0ni /N for i > 2. Thus\nwe must choose the ni equal to a common value n for i > 2, and n2 = 2n. This mode\nthen satisfies the periodicity condition if \u03b1d = 2\u03c0n/N . If we choose n so that cos 2\u03c0n/N\nis negative, this mode is unstable.\nWe are not interested in trying to make sense of the quantum theory in the presence\nof unstable modes. Perhaps under appropriate boundary conditions they are excluded.\nCertainly they can be eliminated by adopting a different sort of discretization scheme.\nThe problem need not concern us here, since the example we shall study in detail is twodimensional. Moreover, our general approach to quantizing the field in the presence of\nmode birth is independent of the issue of stability of the chosen finite difference scheme.\n\n\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n\fIn the continuum, for a fixed spatial wavevector there are two frequencies that solve\nthe dispersion relation, \u03c9 = \u00b1|~k|. On the hyperdiamond lattice, there are still two frequencies (modulo 2\u03c0) that solve the dispersion relation, but, except in two dimensions, the\nfrequencies are not negatives of each other. Indeed, if (\u03c9, ~k) is a solution to (5.8), then so\nis (\u03c9 \u2032 , ~k) if\n\u03c9 \u2032 = \u2212\u03c9 \u2212 2\u03b8.\n(5.9)\nThis is equivalent to the condition \u03a3(\u03c9 \u2032 , ~k) = \u03a3(\u2212\u03c9, \u2212~k) = \u03a3\u0304(\u03c9, ~k), where the last equality\nholds only if \u03c9 is real.\nAnother difference with the continuum in more than two dimensions is that if (\u03c9, ~k) is\na solution, then (\u03c9, \u2212~k) is generally not a solution. Under ~k \u2192 \u2212~k we have z(~k) \u2192 z\u0304(~k),\nso (r, \u03b8) \u2192 (r, \u2212\u03b8). Therefore (\u03c9, \u2212~k) is a solution if and only if (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03b8) = \u00b1(\u03c9 + \u03b8), i.e. if\n\u03b8 = 0 or if \u03c9 = 0.\nAs in the continuum, a massless scalar field has a pair of spatially constant solutions\non the lattice. To complete the list of modes we must include these zero-modes. The\nconstant field with ki = 0 is a zero-mode, as is the mode that grows linearly in time,\nP\n\u03c6 \u221d i v i . These play a role in the particle creation calculation carried out below for the\ntwo-dimensional growing lattice.\n5.2 Quantization on a hyperdiamond lattice\nTo carry out the Fock space quantization procedure we must identify the decomposition of\nthe space of complex classical solutions into positive and negative norm subspaces. This\nyields the representation of the algebra, and a pure state is specified using an element of\nthe Fock space.\n5.2.1 Harmonic modes\nThe Klein\u2013Gordon norm (4.2) of the modes (5.1) is\nh\u03b7k , \u03b7k i = 2N |Nk |2 Im\u03a3,\n\n(5.10)\n\nwhere N is the number of spatial points on the lattice. We assume henceforth that all\ncomponents of the wavevector ki are real, so that \u03b7\u0304k \u03b7k = |Nk |2 . Modes with Im\u03a3 > 0 have\npositive norm, and those with Im\u03a3 < 0 have negative norm. The normalization factor (up\nto an arbitrary phase) is\n\u0001\u22121/2\nNk = 2N |Im\u03a3|\n.\n(5.11)\n\nThe space of modes thus decomposes into these two subspaces, which are conjugate to each\nother. Moreover, they are mutually orthogonal. Consider the pairwise KG inner products:\n\u0001X\n\u03b7\u0304k \u03b7l .\n(5.12)\nh\u03b7k , \u03b7l i = i \u03a3\u0304(l) \u2212 \u03a3(k)\np\u2208S\n\nThe sum will vanish unless the spatial wave vectors for ki and li are equal. As seen in\nSec. 5.1, for a given spatial wavevector the allowed frequencies are \u03c9 and \u2212\u03c9 \u2212 2\u03b8, corresponding to \u03a3(k) and \u03a3(k\u2032 ) = \u03a3\u0304(k). Thus if the modes with the same spatial wavevector\n\n\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n\fare different, then \u03a3(k) = \u03a3\u0304(l). In this case, one mode has positive norm and the other\nhas negative norm, and the inner product vanishes. The modes thus provide a suitable\northonormal basis of complex solutions for constructing a Fock space representation of the\nfield algebra. We use the notation \u03bek for the positive-norm modes, which are just those \u03b7k\nfor which Im\u03a3(ki ) > 0. Explicitly, they are given by\n\n5.2.2 Zero-modes\n\n\u03bek = p\n\n1\ni\ne\u2212iki v .\n2N Im\u03a3(ki )\n\n(5.13)\n\nP i\nThe constant solution \u03c1 = 1 and the linear-in-time solution \u03c3 = t =\ni v both have\nvanishing norm, and they are orthogonal to all the harmonic modes \u03b7k for k 6= 0. The\nKG inner product between them is h\u03c1, \u03c3i = iN . This two-dimensional zero-mode subspace\ncan be split into a positive-norm direction and its conjugate, orthogonal, negative-norm\ndirection, but there is no unique way to do so. The different choices of positive-norm\nzero-modes are \u03c1 \u2212 i\u03b3\u03c3, where \u03b3 = \u03b3R + i\u03b3I is a complex number with positive real part.\nExplicitly, the normalized, positive-norm zero-mode choices are\n\u0010\nX \u0011\n1\n(\u03b3)\n(5.14)\n1 \u2212 i\u03b3\nvi .\n\u03be0 = \u221a\n2N \u03b3R\ni\n5.2.3 Field operator and Fock vacuum\nThe field operator is given as in (4.4) by\nX\n\u0001\n\u03c6\u0302 =\n\u03bek ak + \u03be\u0304k a\u2020k ,\n\n(5.15)\n\nk\n\nwhere the sum is over those ki that satisfy the dispersion relation with Im\u03a3(ki ) > 0, and\nthe ak and a\u2020k satisfy the usual commutation relations of lowering and raising operators.\nThe Fock vacuum is the state satisfying ak |0i for all k. In this state, the expectation\nvalue of the field operator vanishes, and that of the square yields\n\u0011 X\u0010\n\u0011\u22121\n\u0010\n2N Im\u03a3(k)\n.\n(5.16)\nh0|\u03c6(p)\u03c6(p)|0i = (2N \u03b3R )\u22121 (1 + \u03b3I t)2 + (\u03b3R t)2 +\nk6=0\n\nThe time dependence coming from the zero-mode shows that the state is not time independent except for \u03b3 = 0, which does not correspond to a normalizable zero-mode. The\nfield amplitude of the zero-mode is like a free particle, whose wavefunction always spreads.\nOne might be inclined to identify the state with the lowest energy as the preferred\nvacuum. As for a free particle, there is no normalizable state that corresponds to the\nlowest energy of the zero-mode degree of freedom. Considering just the other modes, there\nis also a fundamental issue on the lattice: since time evolution is discrete, there is no\nuniquely defined Hamiltonian, but rather a finite-time evolution operator U (\u2206t). Taking\nthe logarithm one could define a Hamiltonian H = (i/\u2206t) ln U , but this is ambiguous due\nto the freedom to add a multiple of 2\u03c0/\u2206t to any eigenvalue without changing the evolution\noperator.\n\n\u2013 17 \u2013\n\n\fEven if there is no meaningful lowest energy state, one can still ask if the Fock vacuum\nis an eigenstate of the evolution operator. Other than for the zero-mode, the answer is\nyes: if the evolution operator U is defined by U \u2020 \u03c6\u0302(v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v d )U = \u03c6\u0302(v 1 + 1, v 2 , . . . , v d )\nthen, omitting the zero-mode, U |0i = |0i (up to an arbitrary phase). Combining such\ntranslations of the null coordinates one obtains all space and time translations.\n\n6. Mode birth on a growing two-dimensional lattice\nTo explore the phenomenon of mode birth in a simple setting we now specialize to twodimensional lattices. We consider a model in which the lattice is initially regular and then\nsome points are added, after which the lattice is again regular. We first specialize the\nresults of the previous section to two-dimensional regular lattices, then turn to the case\nwhere points are added.\n6.1 Regular diamond lattice\nOn a regular diamond lattice in two dimensions the field equation (3.5,3.6) can be written\nas\nh\n\u0001\n\u0001i h\n\u0001\n\u0001i\n\u03c6(pL ) + \u03c6(pL ) \u2212 \u03c6(pLL ) + \u03c6(p) + \u03c6(pR ) + \u03c6(pR ) \u2212 \u03c6(p) + \u03c6(pRR ) = 0, (6.1)\n\nwhere pL and pR are the left and right children, pL and pR are the left and right parents,\nand pLL and pRR are the left and right siblings of p. In terms of the diamond operator,\n\u0001\n\u0001\u0011\n(6.2)\n\u2738\u03c6(p) = \u03c6(pL ) + \u03c6(pL ) \u2212 \u03c6(pLL ) + \u03c6(p) ,\nthe field equation (6.1) takes the form\n\u2738\u03c6(p) + \u2738\u03c6(pRR ) = 0.\n\n(6.3)\n\nThis asserts that the sum of every pair of adjacent diamonds vanishes, so the diamonds on\neach time slice have the same magnitude and alternating sign. On a finite periodic lattice\nwith N points there are N diamonds. If N is odd the alternation is consistent only if each\ndiamond vanishes individually.\nThe mode functions were found in Sec. 5.1. For the right-moving modes (k2 = 0) we\nhave 2Im\u03a3 = sin k1 . The positive-norm modes (5.13) are those for which sin k1 > 0, and\nare given explicitly by\n1\n1\n\u03bek = \u221a\n(6.4)\ne\u2212ik1 v .\nN sin k1\nA similar expression with (k1 , v 1 ) replaced by (k2 , v 2 ) yields the left-movers. The zero-mode\n(5.14) takes the same form in all dimensions.\nAs explained in section 3.2, we restrict to odd values of N to avoid the alternating\ngauge freedom. Periodicity for the mode solutions (6.4) implies that k1 = 2\u03c0n/N for some\ninteger n, so the spectrum of modes is discrete. We obtain the complete set if n runs from\n\u2212(N \u22121)/2 to (N \u22121)/2. The positive-norm modes are those with positive k1 in this range,\nand the time-independent zero-mode corresponds to n = 0. There are N positive-norm\nmodes all together: (N \u2212 1)/2 left-movers, (N \u2212 1)/2 right-movers, and a zero-mode.\n\n\u2013 18 \u2013\n\n\f6.2 Growing lattice: mode birth\nWe now consider a lattice which is irregular in a localized region where some points are\nadded. To preserve an odd number of points an even number must be added on each slice.\nWe add just two points, with the connectivity5 illustrated in Fig. 1.\nThe point labels a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h will be rea b c\nferred to in this section. The equation of motion\nfrom varying the field at the birth point e implies\nthat\ng\nd\n\u0001\ne f\n\u03c6(e) = \u03c6(a) + \u03c6(b) /2,\n(6.5)\n\ni.e. \u03c6(e) is equal to the average of the future linked\nvalues. A similar equation holds for the birth point\nFigure 1:\nStructure of the lattice f .\nEvolution of solutions backward through the\naround the birth event.\nbirth event, if possible, is unique, as required by\nour linear phase space construction described in section 3.3. Evolution forward is always\npossible, but is not unique since the values at the newborn points are undetermined. All\nsuch evolutions correspond to points in the phase space.\nWe call the slice containing the birth points the birth time. Evolving backwards, the\nvalues at the birth points can be determined from those on the subsequent two slices, but\nunless it so happens that the birth point values are the average of their children's values,\nthe field equation at the birth points is not satisfied. Put differently, there may be no way\nto take the next step backwards that satisfies the field equation at the birth time. Hence,\nthere are half-solutions (cf. section 3.3). The initial data for these birth solutions are given\nat the birth time and on the subsequent slice.\nThe general definition of the quantum theory in section 4 applies to this growing\nlattice. The phase space includes the whole solutions together with the half-solutions.\nThe algebra of linear observables on this phase space is canonically quantized, yielding the\nquantum field algebra. Together with a choice of state-i.e. a positive linear functional on\nthis algebra-the definition of the quantum theory is complete. To construct a concrete\nrepresentation, define a particular state, and compute the value of some observables, we\nnow use the method of mode decompositions.\n\nh\n\n6.3 Mode decompositions and Fock space\nAfter the birth event the lattice is regular, and therefore the Fock space can be based on\nthe harmonic modes (6.4) together with the zero-mode (5.14). A simple set of observables\nto examine are the number operators Nk = a\u2020k ak for these 'out' modes. We shall compute\nthe expectation values h0|Nk |0i, taking for the state |0i the Fock vacuum based on a set of\n'in' modes.\nTo find a complete set of in-modes we begin with the modes before the birth event, and\nchoose a particular evolution among the many that carry these modes through the birth\nevent. We then determine the half-solutions that are orthogonal to the evolved in-modes,\n5\n\nWe also investigated the case where e and f are children of h, which yielded similar results. It might\nbe interesting to explore the consequences of more complicated connectivity of the birth points.\n\n\u2013 19 \u2013\n\n\fand augment the Fock space with these. This requires only the values of all modes at the\nbirth time and the subsequent slice.\nIt is worth emphasizing that the arbitrary choice resolving the ambiguity of evolution\nthrough the birth event does not affect the quantum algebra of observables, since that\nis constructed from all solutions and half-solutions. Nevertheless, the evolution rule does\naffect the inner product of the evolved pre-birth-modes with the half-solutions, since the\ninner products must be evaluated on or after the birth slice. One cannot evaluate on a\nslice prior to the application of the arbitrary rule, since the birth solutions are undefined\nthere.\nAlthough it does not affect the algebra as a whole, the evolution rule does have a\nphysical impact in our construction through the definition of the Fock vacuum. The Fock\nspace is built from an orthonormal basis of positive-norm modes that are orthogonal to\ntheir conjugates. The evolution rule affects the construction of this basis, so it affects the\nFock vacuum. Since all representations are unitarily equivalent however, any Fock state\ndefined using one evolution rule can be expressed as a Fock state in a different Fock space\nconstructed with a different evolution rule. Thus we are not choosing between theories,\nbut rather just between equivalent representations.\n\n6.3.1 Evolution rule\nFor simplicity here we choose the evolution rule that sets the evolved field to zero at the\nbirth points e and f . It might seem more natural to linearly interpolate the field between\nthe neighbors d and g of the birth points. However, as just explained, this would change\nonly the Fock vacuum, not the theory itself. We did examine the particle production using\nthe Fock vacuum arising from the \"interpolation rule\", and the results were similar to those\nof the \"zero rule\". Since the details are simpler for the zero rule, we adopt it for expository\npurposes.\nLet us now see how the fields evolve through the birth event using this evolution rule.\nWith \u03c6(e) = 0, the field equation (6.5) at the birth point e implies that \u03c6(a) = \u2212\u03c6(b).\nSimilarly the equation at f implies that \u03c6(c) = \u2212\u03c6(b). Taken together these imply that\n\u03c6(a) = \u03c6(c).\nNow consider the rest of the equations at the birth time. The field equation at the\nneighbors d and g differs from the standard form (6.3) only in the shape of one of the two\ndiamonds. In particular, in the equation from the variation of the value \u03c6(d), the diamond\non the right consists of the vertices (d, a, g, h), while for the variation of \u03c6(g) the diamond\non the left consists of (d, c, g, h). These two diamonds agree except at the top vertices a\nand c. The diamonds alternate sign around the compact lattice, and there are an even\nnumber N + 1 of diamonds (since in effect the middle diamond has split into two, hence\nthe two middle diamonds must be opposite). But we already saw that the field equations\nat the birth points imply \u03c6(a) = \u03c6(c), so these diamonds must agree. The only consistent\nsolution is that all the diamonds vanish. With this information we can now easily evolve\nthe pre-birth harmonic modes and zero-modes to the next slice after the birth time.\n\n\u2013 20 \u2013\n\n\f6.3.2 Choice of birth modes\nThere are two birth points, so there are four independent real birth modes. We wish to\nchoose these so they are orthogonal to the evolved pre-birth modes. The birth modes are\nto be characterized by their initial data at the birth time, i.e. their values at the birth time\nand on the next slice.\nTo identify these birth modes, we first note that any mode whose initial data is nonvanishing only at the birth points e and f is orthogonal to any evolved pre-birth mode. This\nis because (by the evolution rule) the latter vanish at e and f , and also, by the field equation\n(6.5), the averages on IF (e) and IF (f ) vanish. For two of the birth modes we thus take the\nsymmetric mode S1 (e) = S1 (f ) = 1 and the anti-symmetric mode A1 (e) = \u2212A1 (f ) = \u22121,\nwhere the initial data vanishes at all other points.\nFor the other two birth modes we set the data to zero at the birth time. The symmetric\nmode with S2 (b) = 1 (and zero elsewhere) is orthogonal to all pre-birth-modes since the\npoint b is not to the future of any point except e and f . The fourth and final birth\nmode is the anti-symmetric mode defined by A2 (a) = \u2212A2 (c) = \u22121, A2 (b) = 0, and the\nrequirement that A2 alternates between +1 and \u22121 on the other points around the slice.\nThis is orthogonal to any pre-birth-mode since the sum of the values to the future of any\nbirth time point other than the e and f vanishes.\nBeing real, the four birth modes S1,2 and A1,2 have vanishing norm, and the non-zero\ninner products between them are (S1 , S2 ) = (A1 , A2 ) = i. We seek two complex linear\ncombinations that have positive norm and are orthogonal to both of their conjugates. The\ntwo modes\n\u221a\n\u221a\nA = (A1 \u2212 iA2 )/ 2,\n(6.6)\nS = (S1 \u2212 iS2 )/ 2,\nhave positive-norm, and satisfy the orthogonality requirement, since all modes are orthogonal to their own conjugate, and symmetric modes are orthogonal to antisymmetric ones.\nOther choices than (6.6) could be made. Like for the zero-mode (5.14), the factor of i\n\u221a\ncould be replaced by i\u03b3 (and the denominator replaced by 2Re\u03b3). Moreover, since there\nare two independent positive-norm modes, there is further freedom that involves mixing\nbetween them. The different Fock vacua so obtained are called two-mode squeezed states.\nFor the present model we shall make the simple choice given by (6.6).\n6.4 Growth-induced particle creation\nNow we have all the ingredients for the particle production computation. We wish to\ncompute the mean occupation number of each out-mode when the state is the Fock invacuum.\nThe out-number operator is Nk,out = a\u2020k,out ak,out . To compute its mean value one needs\nto express the annihilation operator ak,out for the out-mode \u03c7k in terms of the in-modes\n\u03bei . We have\nak,out = h\u03c7k , \u03c6\u0302i\n\u0011\nX\u0010\n=\nh\u03c7k , \u03bei iai + h\u03c7k , \u03be \u0304i ia\u2020i ,\ni\n\n\u2013 21 \u2013\n\n(6.7)\n(6.8)\n\n\fand using the Fock vacuum condition ai |0in i = 0 and the commutation relations (4.5) this\nyields\nX\nh0in |Nk,out |0in i =\n|h\u03c7k , \u03be \u0304i i|2 .\n(6.9)\ni\n\nThe sum is over the ingoing harmonic modes and zero-mode, as well as the birth modes.\nFormulae for the Bogoliubov coefficients \u03b2ki = h\u03c7k , \u03be\u0304i i are given in the appendix.\n0\n\n-2\n\nLog <N> -4\n\n-6\n\n-8\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n30\nWave Number\u009010\n\n40\n\n50\n\nFigure 2: Spectrum of created particles on a lattice\nthat begins with 999 points and ends with 1001 points\nafter a birth process as depicted in Fig. 1. Plotted is\nthe Log of the mean number of left-moving particles\nvs. n/10, where the wave number is k = 2\u03c0n/1001.\nBlack squares give the total, while the other curves\nshow the contributions from the left- and right-movers\n(grey and unfilled squares), the symmetric and antisymmetric birth modes (grey and black triangles),\nand the zero-mode (unfilled triangles). The zeromode parameter is \u03b3 = 0.4.\n\nThe spectrum of left-moving created particles is displayed in Fig. 2, along\nwith the contributions to the mean number (6.9) from the left-movers, rightmovers, zero-mode, symmetric birth mode,\nand anti-symmetric birth mode. The\nnumber of lattice points starts out as\n999, and the zero-mode parameter \u03b3 =\n0.4 in (5.14) has been chosen. Most of\nthe contribution comes from the symmetric birth mode at low wavenumbers,\nfrom the anti-symmetric birth mode at\nhigh wave numbers, and from the harmonic modes at intermediate wave numbers. The contribution from left-moving\nharmonic modes is several times higher\nthan from right-moving ones except at\nvery low and very high wave numbers.\nThe contribution from the zero-mode is\nfar smaller than all the rest.\n\nThe number itself is presumably not\nas relevant as the energy of the created\nparticles. As discussed in section 5.2.3, the Hamiltonian-and therefore the energy-is\nnot well-defined on a lattice, due to the ambiguity of adding any multiple of 2\u03c0/\u01eb to\neigenvalues of the Hamiltonian without altering the evolution operator. Nevertheless, we\npresume that, as a model for the microstructure of spacetime, the degree of excitation relative to the translation-invariant Fock vacuum is relevant in determining the gravitational\nback-reaction. We further presume that the smallest positive value of the frequency for a\ngiven positive-norm mode would determine its gravitating energy, at least for modes with\nfrequency much less than 2\u03c0/\u01eb (mod 2\u03c0/\u01eb).\nThis energy and its N dependence can be understood roughly from the form of the\nBogoliubov coefficients in the appendix as follows. The squared Bogoliubov coefficients\n(A.1,A.2) for harmonic in- and out-modes (5.13) goes as |\u03b2kl |2 \u223c N \u22122 (sin k/ sin l). The\nP\nsum over l values gives l (1/ sin l) = O(N ln N ), so the contribution to the number from\nharmonic modes goes as (ln N/N ) sin k. A given k mode carries an energy k. (Possibly\nwe should instead use sin k, but that difference will not qualitatively affect the result.)\n\n\u2013 22 \u2013\n\n\fP\nMultiplying the number by k and summing over k values yields\nk sin k = O(N ), hence\nthe total energy contribution from the harmonic in-mode terms is O(ln N ).\nFor the symmetric birth mode the Bogoliubov coefficient goes as |\u03b2kS |2 \u223c (N sin k)\u22121\nas long as k is not too close to \u03c0. Multiplying by the energy k then yields the sum\nP\nk (k/ sin k) = O(N ), hence the contribution to the energy is O(1). A similar result holds\nfor the antisymmetric birth mode, with a suppression from k near zero. The squared\nzero-mode Bogoliubov coefficient is suppressed by an additional factor of 1/N , yielding an\nenergy contribution of order O(ln N/N ).\nThe total created energy due to the birth event is thus of order \u01eb\u22121 ln N , where the\ndimensionful constant \u01eb setting the scale of length is restored. If every unit of spatial length\nis born accompanied by this amount of energy creation, the result would be incompatible\nwith the effective field theory notion that the field remains near the adiabatic ground state.\nA doubling of the size of the universe would produce a Planck energy density of particles\nin this one-dimensional model.\nIt is possible as usual to express the out-vacuum |0out i as a squeezed state in the\nFock space of the in-modes. If \u03b1ki and \u03b2ki are the Bogoliubov coefficients defined by\nP\n\u2020 \u2020\nak,out = i (\u03b1ki ai +\u03b2ki a\u2020i ), this state takes the form exp(\u2212\u03b1\u22121\nik \u03b2kj ai aj )|0in i, where repeated\nindices are summed. In this squeezed state the in-modes are excited and there are specific\ncorrelations between the excitations of the different in-modes.\nIf the ingoing harmonic modes are assumed to be in their ground state, however, no\namount of fiddling with the birth mode states and the correlations between those and\nthe harmonic modes can substantially change the amount of energy created. The outannihilation operator can be expanded as\nak,out = \u03b1kl al,in + \u03b2kl a\u2020l,in + \u03b1kB aB + \u03b2kB a\u2020B ,\n\n(6.10)\n\nwhere both birth modes are lumped into the one index B. Assuming only that the in-state\nis the vacuum for the harmonic (and zero-) modes, al,in |0i = 0, the mean number evaluates\nto\nX\nh0in |Nk,out |0in i =\n|\u03b2kl |2 + k(\u03b1kB aB + \u03b2kB a\u2020B )|0ik2 .\n(6.11)\nl\n\nThe birth mode state could be chosen so that the second term in (6.11) vanishes, but this\nwould not have a substantial impact on the order of magnitude of the injected energy. The\nspectrum in Fig. 2 shows that, by themselves, the harmonic modes already contribute an\norder unity fraction.\nWithout modifying the assumption that there are no incoming particles, the only\nway to change this conclusion is to modify the evolution rule. This rule affects the in-Fock\nrepresentation, so it affects the state corresponding to the in-Fock vacuum. The expectation\nvalue of the out-number-operator (6.11) is sensitive to this via the Bogoliubov coefficients\n\u03b2ki = h\u03c7k , \u03be \u0304l i, since the out-modes \u03c7k are not defined until the birth time. Some of these\ncoefficients can be suppressed by adjusting the evolution rule. One could tune the rule to\nkill individual coefficients, or one could choose a \"smoothing\" interpolation rule that would\nsuppress the contributions from low wave numbers. However, it seems clear that there is\nno way to avoid the O(\u01eb\u22121 ) energy injection.\n\n\u2013 23 \u2013\n\n\f7. Discussion\nUsing the notion of a phase space of half-solutions, we have managed to quantize a linear\nfield theory on the background of a lattice with a growing number of points. To ensure\na well defined symplectic structure on a linear phase space the lattice was assumed to be\nlayered by time slices, and to admit at most one backwards evolution, and at least one\nforward evolution from any initial data. We were forced to this rather special structure\nby the requirement of staying very close to standard linear QFT. It may be possible to\ngeneralize the structure in various ways and still make sense of the quantum theory. One\nobvious small generalization would be to a different type of lattice that is still layered.\nThe computation of particle creation in the two-dimensional model showed that the\naddition of two points necessarily injects an energy of order \u01eb\u22121 into the field. If more\npoints are added at different times, a similar energy is injected for every unit of length \u01eb\nadded. Since the in-state is no longer the in-vacuum, the particle production would not\nbe identical, but it must clearly be of the same order of magnitude. This would produce\nan enormous energy density of order \u01eb\u22122 during expansion of a model two-dimensional\nuniverse. Extrapolating to our four-dimensional universe, this behavior is not observed.\nOne might hope that in four dimensions the effect of adding points at the lattice scale would\nnot be so brutal, but this seems highly unlikely, as the form of the Bogoliubov coefficients\nshould be comparable to those in the appendix.6 This should be expected, since the birth\nprocess violates time and space translation symmetry on a time and length scale of \u01eb, hence\nit it should be accompanied by a violation of energy conservation of order \u01eb\u22121 .\nA way out of this energy catastrophe might arise if many points are added at the same\ntime. Then many modes are born at the same time, and wave interference could perhaps\nsuppress the net energy injected. This question can be studied in the two-dimensional\nmodel.\nIf interference effects cannot reduce the injected energy, then one would conclude that\nQFT on a background growing lattice is not the right setting to describe mode birth in\na growing universe. If there is nevertheless a physically correct formulation, it would\npresumably operate at the level where the spacetime itself is treated as dynamical, rather\nthan as a fixed background. The complete dynamics might ensure that the system remains\nnear the adiabatic vacuum. Perhaps this scenario could be explored using the causal\ndynamical triangulations formulation of quantum gravity[14].\nApart from trying to address the fundamental problem of the cosmological vacuum,\nour formulation of mode birth could be applied to field propagation outside a black hole. In\na geodesic normal coordinate system the spatial metric grows with respect to the geodesic\nproper time, by an amount that depends upon the radius. Discretizing the radial coordinate\nand keeping time continuous one obtains an expanding lattice version of the black hole\nspacetime in which the number of degrees of freedom is constant. The Hawking effect on\nsuch a falling spatial lattice was studied in [15, 16]. It was found that the outgoing modes\narise via a process analogous to Bloch oscillation, and the continuum Hawking effect is\nrecovered when the lattice spacing is small compared to the inverse surface gravity of the\n6\n\nPerhaps the extra ln N would go away in higher dimensions, but that is not our first concern.\n\n\u2013 24 \u2013\n\n\fhorizon. Rather than keeping time continuous and allowing the lattice to expand, one could\ninstead discretize the time and allow for points to be added so as to keep the lattice scale\nroughly constant. This would bring into play the sort of indeterminate evolution and mode\nbirth studied here. In spite of the energy injection by mode birth, the Hawking effect could\npresumably be recovered provided the Hawking occupation number per outgoing mode is\ngreater than the number induced by the birth events.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported in part by the NSF under grant PHY-0300710 at the University\nof Maryland, and by the CNRS at the Institut d'Astophysique de Paris.\n\nA. Bogoliubov coefficients\nIn this appendix we present the inner-products between harmonic out-modes and the various negative-norm in-modes that appear in the two-dimensional, growing lattice example\nof Section 6.\nFor our purposes-calculation of the value of the number operator-we need only the\nnorm of the value of the inner products. Consequently, we can freely choose the over-all\nphase of a given mode. For definiteness, here we set the phase of the out-modes to zero at\npoint d (see Figure 1 for point labels). For the harmonic, non-zero in-modes, we have set\nthe phase to zero at point h. The left-moving mode, when evolved according to the rule\nof Section 6.3.1, has zero phase at point d, the left child of h. The right-moving mode has\nzero phase at point g, the right child of h. We take the zero-mode and the birth modes\nexactly as defined in Section 6.3.2.\nThe formulas correspond to a left-moving harmonic out-mode \u03c7k (we do not consider\nthe out-zero-mode). The results for a right-moving mode are identical up to a phase, except\nthat Eqn. (A.1) now corresponds to the inner product with a right-moving in-mode, and\nEqn. (A.2) to that with a left-moving in-mode. All formulas hold for either sign of k;\ni.e. for both positive- and negative-norm out-modes. The positive-norm modes correspond\nto those for which sin(k) > 0, and vice-versa for the negative-norm modes.\nFor the inner-product with a left-moving in-mode of wave-number l, \u03belL , we have:\nh\u03belL , \u03c7k i\n\n=\n\nAlN \u22122 AkN\n\n\u0010\n\ni(l\u2212k)\n\nsin k e\n\u0010\n\n+\n\n= AlN \u22122 AkN sin k ei(l\u2212k) +\n\nN\n\u22123\nX\n\nein(l\u2212k)\n\nn=0\n\n\u0011\n\n(A.1)\n\nei(N \u22122)(l\u2212k) \u0011\n\n1\u2212\n1 \u2212 ei(l\u2212k)\n\n,\n\np\nwith AkN = 1/ N | sin k|.

For example, hS, \u03c7k i = \u2212hS\u0304, \u03c7\u2212k i\u2217 .\n\nReferences\n[1] T. Jacobson, Trans-Planckian redshifts and the substance of the space-time river, Prog.\nTheor. Phys.
