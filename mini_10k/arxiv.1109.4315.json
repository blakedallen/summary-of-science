This notion has however\nfaced a serious challenge since Riess's 1998 discovery[1] of cosmic acceleration. The purpose of\nthis research is to evaluate the question: can the back-reaction of long-wavelength gravitational\nwaves in a closed universe contribute to cosmic acceleration while remaining compatible with\nobservational constraints?\n\n1.1\n\nStandard cosmology predicts an expanding universe\n\nThe full Einstein equations read1\n1\nR\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 Rg\u03bc\u03bd = kT\u03bc\u03bd + \u039bg\u03bc\u03bd\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere g\u03bc\u03bd is the metric tensor, R\u03bc\u03bd is the once-contracted Riemann tensor, R is the Ricci curvature scalar, T\u03bc\u03bd is the energy-momentum tensor, \u039b is the \"cosmological constant\" and the constant\nk \u2261 8\u03c0G/c4 \u2248 2.08 \u00d7 10\u221243 kg\u22121 m\u22121 s2 . The Bianchi identity guarantees T11 = T22 = T33 so, in\na Gaussian (g00 = 1) and synchronous (g0i = 0) coordinate system we have[4]:\n\n1\nR00 \u2212 R =kT00 + \u039b\n2\n\u2212R =kT\u03bc\u03bc \u2212 2\u039b\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\n.\n1 Throughout this document, indices written with Greek letters \u03bc, \u03bd etc. run over 0,1,2,3 and indices written\nin Roman letters i, j etc. run over 1,2,3. The sign of the metric tensor reads +, \u2212, \u2212, \u2212.\n\n\f1\n\n5\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nCosmological parameters\nIn discussions of cosmology it is conventional to track the expansion of an isotropic metric by\nintroducing a \"scale factor\", a positive function of time only. In general the scale factor has\nno specific geometric meaning other than to compare distances in the metric at different points\nin time. Furthermore, the scale factor loses unique meaning when the universe becomes nonisotropic. We will denote this scale factor function as a (t) in analogy with its definition in the\nRobertson-Walker metric, where it appears as[5]\n\nds2 = dt2 \u2212 a2 (t)\n\n\u00012\n\u00012\n\u00012\ndx1 + dx2 + dx3\ni2\nh\n2\n2\n2\n1 + 14 K (dx1 ) + (dx2 ) + (dx3 )\n\n(4)\n\nand the symbol K has the value 0 in a flat universe, 1 in a closed universe, and -1 in an open\nuniverse. In this case the Einstein equations read2\n\u0001\n3\n\u02272 + K =k\u01eb + \u039b\n2\na\n\u00e4\n\u22126 =k (\u01eb + 3p) \u2212 2\u039b\na\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\nwhere \u01eb denotes the energy density of matter described by the energy-momentum tensor and p\ndenotes the pressure of matter described in that tensor. Let the Hubble parameter be defined by\nH \u2261 \u0227/a and let H0 be the value of H at the present time (this is how we will generally use the\nsubscript 0 ). Because the universe seems flat and dominated by ordinary matter over small scales,\nit is common to move terms arising from K to the right-hand side of the equation, where they act\nas elements of an \"effective energy-momentum tensor\", and to state contributors to cosmological\nexpansion as dimensionless parameters \u03a9i in comparison to the \"critical density\" \u01ebcritical , that\nis, the energy-density of ordinary matter required for the universe to be flat: k\u01ebcritical = 3H02 so\n3H02 = k\u01eb0 + \u039b \u2212 3 aK2\n0\n\u03a9K + \u03a9M + \u03a9R + \u03a9\u039b = 1\n\n(7)\n\nwhere\n\n\u03a9M + \u03a9R \u2261\n\n\u03a9\u039b \u2261\n\n\u03a9K \u2261\n\nk\u01eb0 /3H02\n\n(8)\n\n\u039b/3H02\n\u2212K/\u022720\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\n. multiple observations, most recently by WMAP, have confirmed that \u03a9R \u226a \u03a9M [16] and so to\nthe limit of the precision with which these quantities can be evaluated \u03a9K + \u03a9M + \u03a9\u039b = 1.3\n2A\n\nsingle dot denotes a derivative with respect to t; two dots denote a second derivative with respect to t.\nin [81], elegantly derives a description of the scale factor in an open Friedmann cosmology which can\nbe used when there is a significant amount of relativistic matter in a cold matter-dominated universe. Chernin's\nequation is easily generalized to the closed Friedmann universe.\n3 Chernin,\n\n\f1\n\n6\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n1.2\n\nSimple cosmology predicts a decelerating universe\n\nIf the scale factor a measures a distance, it is reasonable to say by analogy that \u0227 can be compared\nto a velocity and \u00e4 an acceleration. In isotropic cosmology we define the \"deceleration parameter\"\nQ by4 :\n\nQ\u2261\u2212\n\n\u00e4a\nd 1\n=\n\u22121\n\u02272\ndt H\n\n(11)\n\n. Dividing (6) by (7) we easily obtain\n\nQ=\n\n1\n1 k (\u01eb + 3p) \u2212 2\u039b\n= \u03a9M \u2212 \u03a9\u039b\n2 k\u01eb + \u039b \u2212 K/a2\n2\n\n(12)\n\n. A flat universe with no cosmological constant must always decelerate. While the properties of\nso-called \"dark matter\" remain undetermined, the localisibility of dark matter's distribution and\nits slow motion implies it can be treated as w = 0 dust.\nWe can also immediately say that in a universe with no cosmological constant, acceleration is\npossible under the condition\n\u0001\n2\n1 \u2212 K/a2 k\u01eb < 0\n(13)\n1 + 3w\n.\n\n1.3\n\nObservations say the universe is accelerating\n\nAcceleration in and of itself is not a newcomer to cosmology. The de Sitter cosmology[82],\ndiscovered in 1917, is driven solely by a cosmological constant and consequently has a constant\ndeceleration parameter of Q = \u22121. Bondi, Gold & Hoyle's \"steady state\" universe[83] similarly\naccelerates with Q = \u22121, this value being associated with a universe whose expansion is driven\nsolely by a field whose energy density is not dependent on the size of the universe. With the\nproposal of \"big bang\" nucleosynthesis[84] and the subsequent discovery of the cosmic microwave\nbackground[85], consensus came to settle on the simplest matter-filled model, the Friedmann\nuniverse.[86]\nThroughout the 1990s, astronomical observations began to indicate that the matter energy density of the universe was far below the critical density, leading some (for example [87]) to propose\nthe resurrection of the cosmological constant in order to preserve the observed near-flatness of\nspace.\nIn 1998, Riess et al. published an analysis[1] of the light from a small number of type Ia supernovae\nwith 0.16 \u2264 z \u2264 0.62 and concluded from this set that the recent universe is accelerating with\nQ0 = \u22121.0 \u00b1 0.4. Further observations and analysis (see Part II) have also provided evidence\nthat the universe has Q0 < 0.\n4 Q has been defined with a minus sign for historical reasons. Q > 0 denotes a decelerating universe; Q < 0\ndenotes an accelerating universe. We have avoided the more common notation q in favor of Q to avoid confusion\nwhen interpreting the source material.\n\n\f2\n\n7\n\nDARK ENERGY\n\nWhile Riess et al. did not exclude the possibility of a universe with K 6= 0, the assumption of a\nflat universe remains predominant throughout the field of cosmology as observations, both from\nsupernova data and WMAP, have shown that the universe is, on observable scales, very close\nto flat \u2013 although it is impossible to distinguish between a universe that is genuinely flat, with\n\u03a9K = 0 and one with \u03a9K very close to but not equal to zero.\n\n2\n\nDark energy\n\nSince the discovery of acceleration, numerous explanations for the phenomenon have been proposed, all depending on an isotropic field creating additional, invisible energy. Turner and\nHuterer[6] introduce the term \"dark energy\", analogous to dark matter in the sense that dark\nenergy does not interact electromagnetically with ordinary matter and has the property of an\nenergy density, to term this additional energy, which appears to make up over 70% of the total\nenergy content of the universe[16].\nThe assumption of a flat homogeneous cosmology demands that cosmic acceleration comes from\na cosmological constant or a scalar field. Most scalar theories for explaining cosmic acceleration\nfall into two classes: an exotic form of matter with negative energy density, and surrender of the\ncosmological principle. Other scalar theories sacrifice different assumptions, such as homogeneity,\nor invoke more exotic explanations unsupported by laboratory physics.\n\n2.1\n\nCosmological constant\n\nThe simplest most familiar variation on the Robertson-Walker cosmological model which allows\nan accelerating universe is the \"\u039bCDM\" model \u2013 a universe dominated by \"cold\" (non-relativistic,\np = 0) matter with both baryonic and dark components, and with the existence of a non-zero\ncosmological constant. In such a universe the Einstein equations read[5]\n\n3H 2 =k\u01eb + \u039b\n\u00e4\n\u22126 =k\u01eb \u2212 2\u039b\na\n\n(14)\n(15)\n\n2\n\nso when k\u01eb/\u039b is small such that (k\u01eb/\u039b) is negligible, that is, the universe is dominated by a\ncosmological constant,\n\nQ=\n\n3k\u01eb\n1 k\u01eb \u2212 2\u039b\n\u2248 \u22121 +\n2 k\u01eb + \u039b\n2\u039b\n\n(16)\n\nwhich at first glance appears to neatly explain Riesse et al.'s result. However, as will be shown\n(see section 6), the case for a cosmological constant is not definite. Furthermore, the theoretical\nbackground explaining the strength of the cosmological constant is not well developed, relying\non an understanding of quantum gravity which does not yet exist[72]. While the cosmological\nconstant can always be said to have a \"right to exist\" in the Einstein equations, current physics\ndoes not explain why it should have any particular strength and as such the cosmological constant\nshould be treated as the simplest form of a scalar field of exotic matter.\n\n\f2\n\nDARK ENERGY\n\n2.2\n\n8\n\nQuintessence\n\nMore general than the cosmological constant but similar in structure is the proposal of \"quintessence\"[6],\na novel form of matter with a time-dependent equation of state that can take on negative values. Many forms of these have been proposed; one form of these, for example, is the \"Chaplygin\ngas\"[88], which has equation of state p = \u2212A/\u01eb for A > 0. Quintessence theories are particularly\nmotivated by the idea that acceleration is a cosmologically recent phenomenon, noting limited\ndata (see Part II) that the equation of state of dark energy may be evolving with time.\nAny formulation of quintessence must be regarded as highly speculative. At the most fundamental\nlevel, all theories of quintessence propose the existence of a kind of matter which:\n\u2022 has never been observed experimentally;\n\u2022 does not interact with ordinary matter via the electromagnetic force;\n\u2022 has a negative equation of state, that is, a positive energy density produces a negative\npressure;\n\u2022 plays a prominent role at current energy levels, as opposed to exotic effects (e.g. unification\nof forces) thought to have taken place only in the very early universe.\nIn the absence of any compelling experimental evidence whatsoever for any kind of quintessence,\nquintessence and quintessence-like models should be rejected as definitive explanations for dark\nenergy.\n\n2.3\n\nLocal inhomogeneity\n\nA more mundane explanation which has been offered for acceleration is the \"Hubble bubble\"[1, 61],\nregions of lower density in the intergalactic medium. If the vicinity of the Milky Way had lower\nmatter energy density, expansion in its vicinity would increase[93], causing the illusion of cosmic\nacceleration.\nNot only would the density deficit in such a \"bubble\" have to be quite large in order to cause\nacceleration, but the theory, which has the advantage of requiring no new physics, supposes\neither the existence of a rare or unique void that the Milky Way happens to be in \u2013 a violation\nof the cosmological principle in the sense that it makes observers in the Milky Way privileged \u2013\nor a preponderance of voids whose presence makes the universe inhomogeneous not just in small\npatches but on average.[91, 94]\n\n2.4\n\nExotic models\n\nModified relativity\nSome proposals to explain dark energy propose modifications to the Einstein equations. The bestknown of these is the Cardassian Expansion model[95], which proposes time-dependent variation\nof the equation of state of matter. The Cardassian model is of particular interest in that it\nproposes an equation for the density perturbation\n\n\f3\n\nTENSORIAL THEORIES FOR ACCELERATION IN A FLAT UNIVERSE\n\n3\ns\n\u03ba\u2032\u2032 (x) + 2 \u03ba\u2032 \u2212 s2 \u03ba = 0\nx\n2\n\n9\n\n(17)\n\nfor unknown constant s, which equation begins to resemble that for weak gravitational waves\nin a closed universe (cf. equation (153)). Like Chaplygin gas and the \"DGP\" model[96], the\nCardassian model justifies itself based on theories about higher-dimensional manifolds which\nremain untested.\n\nTopological defects\nThe existence of cosmic strings would change the overall equation of state of the matter in the\nuniverse by a constant[67, 97], creating acceleration through simple deviation from the Friedmann\nmodel. While theories of cosmic inflation predict the formation of cosmic strings and other\ntopological defects, such defects remain completely undetected.\n\n3\n\nTensorial theories for acceleration in a flat universe\n\nIf we wish to preserve the theory of relativity and cosmic homogeneity, while at the same time\nrelying only on effects with good experimental basis, scalar fields appear to be excluded as an\nexplanation for acceleration. Ergo within the context of general relativity the next place to search\nfor an answer is in tensor theories, which include the possibility of gravitational waves.\nLifshitz's theory of cosmological perturbations[79] appears to exclude tensorial answers to the\nproblem of acceleration: gravitational waves have the same equation of state as radiation, and\nlocal clumps gravitational waves in the theory (where \"local\" means bounded within an region\nsmaller than the radius of curvature of the universe) both decay rapidly and collapse spatially.\nRodrigues[113] takes a first step in discussing anisotropic dark energy, but limits his analysis to\na flat universe and thus creates the problem of an anisotropic \"big rip\".\nA high-frequency gravitational wave background has been proposed[92] as the source of cosmic\nacceleration. While the authors' analysis appears initially promising, similar to many scalar dark\nenergy candidates the theory relies on the existence of an inflation-induced gravitational wave\nbackground that remains only hypothetical. Furthermore, the authors obtain their result by\nselection of an averaging scheme without mathematical rigor \u2013 surely choosing a mathematical\nmodel based on the desired results cannot be considered physics. At any rate, the strength of\nthe background inflationary theory predicts is not sufficiently great to explain the observed large\nacceleration.\n\n\f10\n\nPart II\n\nEvidence for acceleration\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe theory of tests to evaluate the deceleration parameter using supernovae as standard candles began with Wagoner[45] in 1977. Starting from assumptions of an isotropic Friedmannian\ncosmology which is not necessarily flat, Wagoner notes the approximate relation\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0001\n1\ndE = H0\u22121 z \u2212 (1 + Q0 ) z 2 + O z 3\n2\n\n(18)\n\nwhich, when H0 and z are known, relates the deceleration parameter to the distance dE as\ndetermined by the dimming of the supernova (where Wagoner was originally discussing Type II\nsupernova events)5 . This relation is valid when z is small such that z 3 is negligible, limiting its\nusefulness above z \u223c 1, and requires the assumption of only small changes in the Hubble constant\nH0 (that is, in a Friedmann cosmology \u0227F /aF evaluated near the observer) on the interval from\nz \u2248 0 to z \u2248 1.\nType Ia supernovae are thought to be a \"standard candle\" for the measurement of distance\nand redshift; that is, supernovae of that type are thought to possess spectral and luminosity\ncurves which are nearly identical. Therefore, observation of extragalactic type Ia supernovae is\nbelieved to produce reliable information on both the distance of the event (noting that brightness\ndiminishes as the inverse square of distance) and the redshift of the distance associated with the\nevent (through the change in the peak of the supernovae's spectra), with redshift z related to\nthe scale factor aF by\n\u0001\naF tobservation\n\u0001\nz+1=\n(19)\naF temission\n. Analysis of a statistically unbiased dataset of z (t) therefore gives empirical information on\nQ (t).\nColgate[44] proposed that Type I supernovae should be used to measure the deceleration parameter in preference to Type II supernovae. Type I supernovae, specifically the \"Type Ia\" whose\nmechanism is thought to be the accretion of matter onto the surface of a white dwarf star, are\nunderstood to have a well-defined typical absolute magnitude and spectrum, and assuming this\nis true the distance to and redshift of a given Type Ia supernova event (SNe) can easily be determined by fitting its light curve to standard templates. Therefore, with a sufficient sample of\nextragalactic supernovae of z . 1, the parameters H and Q can be measured directly. When an\nisotropic cosmology with constant deceleration parameter Q = Q0 is assumed, knowledge of H0\nand Q0 are sufficient to typify the parameters of the universe[4].\nWith the advent of modern optical astronomy such as adaptive optics[46] and space-based optical\ntelescopy[47], such surveys have become possible, but have produced results contradicting the\nstandard, cold matter-filled Friedmann model of cosmology.\n5 Equation\n\n(18) is of course a generalization of the famous distance-redshift approximation H0 dE \u2248 z.[4]\n\n\f5\n\n5\n\nSURVEYS OF ACCELERATION\n\n11\n\nSurveys of acceleration\n\nCosmological studies measuring Q have been ongoing since 1997 and consist of analysis of\nredshifts[1, 3, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 43, 48, 49, 51, 50, 52, 53, 55, 56, 54, 57, 58] of type Ia supernovae.\nThe High-z Supernova Search Team's initial study of the deceleration parameter[1] was the\nfirst large study to call attention to the problem of acceleration. Working from a sample of\nsixteen supernovae (four of which were well-observed \"high confidence\" sources), the most distant\nwith z = 0.97, Riess concluded that the universe has Q0 < 0 to high confidence, although\nthe measurement of Q0 itself possessed a high degree of uncertainty. Riess also noted the high\nsensitivity of the result to individual data points. Oddly, the authors dismiss the closed cosmology\ndespite the data indicating it as preferred[1, Fig. 7]; however the size of their experimental error\nprecludes real evaluation of spatial curvature.\nThe Supernova Cosmology Project (SCP) made an earlier attempt to evaluate Q0 with the use\nof supernovae[55]. This small survey (n = 7) on relatively nearby supernovae found a result\ninconsistent with those that followed it, giving results consistent with a universe with no dark\nenergy and with too high a degree of error to meaningfully evaluate the geometry of the universe.\nIn contrast, the Supernova Cosmology Project's 1998 evaluation[48, 49] of 42 Type Ia SNe added\nfurther evidence that the universe was accelerating, and also makes note of the surprising coincidence of the energy density \u03a9\u039b 's near-equivalence with the total energy density in the current\nepoch. The SCP also failed to consider the closed cosmology despite supernova data favoring\nit[49, Fig. 7].\nThe ESSENCE[11] survey was expressly designed to examine cosmic acceleration and detected\n102 type-Ia supernovae from 0.10 \u2264 z \u2264 0.78, of which 60 were used for cosmological analysis. The\ninitial analysis of ESSENCE assumed flatness of the universe. ESSENCE's observational fields\nwere deliberately chosen to overlap the areas of previous surveys and to lie within ten degrees\nof the celestial equator; all were also between 23:25 and 02:33 Right Ascension. Combining data\nfrom ESSENCE, SNLS and other sources[52] led to a conclusion consistent with other analyses.\nExploration of more exotic models[53] found that no model of those tested was a good fit for\nESSENCE's data.\nThe Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS)[12] recorded 472 type-Ia supernovae. While analysis of the\nSNLS dataset[13] provides results consistent with a universe driven by cosmological constant, the\nuncertainty on analysis of a time-dependent component to the equation of state of dark energy\nis very large; their analysis also does not consider a closed universe as a possible model[50].\nFurthermore, the SNLS team also note the presence of two outliers and only 125 of 472 events\nwere used to evaluate cosmology. SNLS observed SNe in four fields, one of which (field 3) is far\nabove the plane of the celestial equator at 52 degrees declination; this and [54]'s northern field are\nthe only fields with multiple observations in a small area more than 20 degrees from the celestial\nequator surveyed to date. SNLS also notes[50, section 5.4] that the values of \u03a9M evaluated in\nthe four fields are compatible only at a 37% confidence level \u2013 a surprising result given that each\nSNLS field contains at least 60 SNe in quite small (one square degree) areas.\nThe Hubble Space Telescope or HST survey of supernovae, published in 2004 and reviewed by\nthe Supernova Cosmology Project[14] observed twenty type-Ia supernovae with redshifts 0.63 <\nz < 1.42. While the number of SNe observed is small, the HST survey has the advantage of\ncovering a wider area of sky than other SNe surveys. Analysis of the HST dataset suggests a\nrapidly-evolving dark energy field, although with very high error on measurements greater than\nz = 1 due to the small (n = 10) sample size it is impossible to take these results as anything\nmore than suggestive. HST slightly favored a closed model of the universe, when considering\n\n\f5\n\nSURVEYS OF ACCELERATION\n\n12\n\ninterpretations of data that allowed \u03a9K 6= 0.\nThe Supernova Cosmology Project's 2008 analysis of supernova data[51] made a analysis of\ncombined SNLS, ESSENCE and HST data, and attempted to analyze the data in the context\nof a theory of a time-dependent equation of state for dark energy but concluded \"present SN\ndata sets do not have the sensitivity to answer the questions of whether dark energy persists to\nz > 1, or whether it had negative pressure then.\" The analysis rejected 10% of all SNe from the\ncombined data sets as outliers, many based on their failure to fit with a nearby H0 ; Kowalski\net al.' s rejection of outliers also shifts their analysis from one favoring a closed universe to one\nfavoring a flat one[51, Fig. 11].\nFurther work by Riess et. al.[54, 56] produced the so-called \"gold\" dataset of SNe, a group of\nsupernova events with particularly clear light curves with 33 at z > 1. These supernovae were\nobserved in two small (one square degree) fields. [54] claims a great reduction in the uncertainty\nof the Hubble parameter at z > 1 but the Hubble parameter measured in the extended \"gold\"\nset gives a value for the Hubble parameter not reconcilable with that in the [56] dataset. Riess\net. al. conclude that w is negative (with large experimental error) in the region 1 < z < 2, then\nattempt to extrapolate the behavior of dark energy back to z = 1089.\nSollerman et al' s analysis of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II supernova data[3, 9] is the most\nrecent analysis indicating cosmic acceleration. SDSS-II observed 103 type-Ia supernovae in a\nlong, narrow strip along the celestial equator, including many from lower redshifts than had been\npreviously examined in detail; Sollerman et. al. also made use of data from the HST, ESSENCE\nand SNLS surveys, bringing the total number of SNe examined to 288. The primary conclusion\nto be drawn from SDSS is the sensitivity of cosmological measurements to the specific analysis\ntechnique used[60]; analysis of the data with two different curve-fitting algorithms produce two\ndifferent, albeit somewhat compatible, results.\nFurther obscuring the neatness of measuring Q, Jha et. al. noted[59] that the uneven local\ndistribution of galaxies, specifically the existence of voids, can lead to a mis-estimation of H0 on\nthe order of 6.5% for a given galaxy.\nFinally, of note is the WiggleZ dark energy survey[15, 43]. WiggleZ is the most extensive redshift\nsurvey thus far conducted, with some 280,000 galaxies with 0.2 < z < 1.0 used as sources.\nWiggleZ also covers a wider area of sky than previous surveys, examining some 1000 square\ndegrees in multiple windows around the sky. Two of WiggleZ's windows overlap with SDSS-II's\nsurvey area, so while WiggleZ is ongoing preliminary results [57, 58] can be used to improve the\nevaluation of Q by improving precision on measurements of z of SNe host galaxies. The authors\nof [58] note that \"the redshift-space clustering pattern is not isotropic in the true cosmological\nmodel\", attributing the variation to \"the coherent, bulk flows of galaxies toward clusters and\nsuperclusters\". Analysis by the WiggleZ team of pre-existing SNe datasets, using the new, more\nprecise data on galaxy redshifts they obtained, reconfirms the fact of acceleration, and generates\nresults consistent with other surveys, but the data lack sufficient precision to determine the\nhistory of Q.\nTable 3 details the sky locations of SNe and galaxies used in the determination of acceleration;\nFigure 5 presents these locations graphically. Table 1 in Appendix summarizes the results of\nthese surveys.\n\n\f5\n\n13\n\nSURVEYS OF ACCELERATION\n\nSurvey\nSupernova Cosmology Project 1997[55]\nHigh-z Supernova Search Team[1]\nSupernova Cosmology Project 1998[49]\nHST[14]\nESSENCE[11]\nSupernova Legacy Survey[12, 50]\nESSENCE + SNLS[52]\nSupernova Cosmology Project combined[51]\nRiess \"gold\" sample[56, 54]\nWiggleZ[58]\nSurvey\nSupernova Cosmology Project 1997\nHigh-z Supernova Search Team\nSupernova Cosmology Project 1998\nHST\nESSENCE\nSupernova Legacy Survey\nESSENCE + SNLS\nSupernova Cosmology Project combined\nRiess \"gold\" sample\nWiggleZ\nSloane Digital Sky Survey-II\nSurvey\nSupernova Cosmology Project 1997\nHigh-z Supernova Search Team\nSupernova Cosmology Project 1998\nHST\nESSENCE\nSupernova Legacy Survey\nESSENCE + SNLS\nSupernova Cosmology Project combined\nRiess \"gold\" sample\nWiggleZ\nSloane Digital Sky Survey-II\n\nNo of SNe\n7\n16\n42\n20\n102\n125\n162\n307\n16\n557\n\nz\n0.35 < z < 0.46\n0.16 < z < 0.97\n0.18 < z < 0.86\n0.63 < z < 1.42\n0.10 \u2264 z \u2264 0.78\n0.015 < z < 1\n0.015 < z < 1\n0.015 < z < 1\n1.25 < z < 2\n0.1 < z < 0.9\n\n\u03a9\u2020\u039b\n0.06+0.28\n\u22120.34\n0.72+0.72\n\u22120.48\n0.72+0.08\n\u22120.09\n0.715+0.036\n\u22120.057\n0.726+0.020\n\u22120.032\n0.751 \u00b1 0.080\n0.733+0.018\n\u22120.028\n0.785+0.046\n\u22120.045\n0.71+0.03\n\u22120.05\n0.71 \u00b1 0.03\n0.693 \u00b1 .0421\n0.744 \u00b1 .0412\n0.74 \u00b1 .023\n\n\u03a9M\n0.94+0.34\n\u22120.28\n0.24+0.56\n\u22120.24\n0.28+0.09\n\u22120.08\n0.286+0.022\n\u22120.023\n0.274+0.032\n\u22120.020\n0.271 \u00b1 0.020\n0.267+0.028\n\u22120.018\n0.285+0.030\n\u22120.030\n0.29+0.05\n\u22120.03\n0.29 \u00b1 0.03\n0.307 \u00b1 .0421\n0.256 \u00b1 .0412\n0.25 \u00b1 .023\n\n\u2021\nQflat\n0\n+0.14\n0.41\u22120.17\n\u22121.0 \u00b1 0.4\n\u22120.58+0.04\n\u22120.05\n\u22120.572+0.045\n\u22120.025\n\u22120.589+0.022\n\u22120.004\n\u22120.620 \u00b1 0.060\n\u22120.600+0.009\n\u22120.014\n\u22120.642+0.030\n\u22120.031\n\u22120.56+0.05\n\u22120.02\n\u22120.56 \u00b1 0.02\n\u22120.539 \u00b1 .0211\n\u22120.616 \u00b1 .0212\n\u22120.61 \u00b1 .013\n\n\u03a9K\n(dne)\n(dne)\n(dne)\n\u22120.001+0.037\n\u22120.013\n(dne)\n(dne)\n(dne)\n\u22120.010+0.016\n\u22120.015\n(dne)\n(dne)\n.04 \u00b1 .04\n\nwX0\n(dne)\n(dne)\n(dne)\n\u22120.997+0.266\n\u22120.293\n\u22121.047+0.125\n\u22120.124\n\u22121.023 \u00b1 0.087\n\u22121.069+0.091\n\u22120.093\n\u22121.001+0.149\n\u22120.155\n\u22121.02+0.13\n\u22120.19\n(dne)\n\nwXa\n(dne)\n(dne)\n(dne)\n0.13+1.16\n\u22121.57\n(dne)\n(dne)\n(dne)\n(dne)\n*\n(dne)\n\n\u22120.76 \u00b1 .181\n\u22120.96 \u00b1 .182\n\n(dne)\n\nTable 1: Summary of results from surveys indicating acceleration\n\n\"dne\" = \"Does not evaluate\". *: [56] attempts to analyze wa with several different constraints\nbut provides no numerical figure for its estimate of wa 's value. \u2020: Where not explicitly stated in\nflat\nthe source, \u03a9\u039b is evaluated from \u03a9M + \u03a9K + \u03a9\u039b = 1. \u2021: Q0 = 12 \u03a9M \u2212 \u03a9\u039b .

Most data has been collected in a small area of the sky near the\nequator. Triangles: Riess 1998 supernovae. Five-pointed stars: HST SNe. Six-pointed stars:\nRiess \"gold\" dataset. The long, thin strip centered on 0,0 is the SDSS-II survey area. Other\nboxes are the SNLS and ESSENCE survey areas.\n\n6\n\nAnalysis\n\nAnalysis of supernova data is, in one sense, quite consistent: all surveys apart from [55] agree that\nfor z < 1 we have a deceleration parameter Q0 = \u22120.6. Deeper analysis suffers from a lack of data\nat high redshifts and large numbers of free parameters in cosmological models, especially when\nmore exotic models are considered. Meanwhile, while most surveys indicate that the acceleration\nin recent times acts as though driven by a cosmological constant, with an equation of state\ncompatible with wX = \u22121, the results from [60] show that this can be the result of the prior\nassumptions made about the model of dark energy.\nNo definitive statement can be made about the evolution of Q0 over time from the information\nthus far available, particularly not statements connecting the state of cosmic acceleration now\nwith the state of acceleration at the epoch of last scattering.\nNor can any definitive statement be made about cosmological models, other than to say that the\nmost conservative, \u039bCDM model fits the data at best inconsistently. Few studies of supernova\ndata on acceleration examine the question of curvature in depth.\nThe majority of SNe data is collected from a single patch of sky: the field bounded by RA 22:00,\nRA 04:00, Dec +1\u25e6 15\u2032 and Dec \u221210\u25e6 00\u2032 (the \"highly-observed field\"). This area comprises 1350\nsquare degrees, or only 2.1% of the sky. Surveys taken in small fields outside the highly-observed\nfield, such as the Riess \"gold\" dataset, have high internal consistency, while surveys covering larger\nareas of sky have much lower consistency; the \"gold\" dataset contains the same number of SNe\nas the [1] but has a standard error less than a tenth the size. It is also telling that the four SNLS\nfields produced results that correlated poorly (37% confidence) with one another[50], where two of\nthe SNLS survey regions are well outside the highly-observed field. Compounding cosmographic\n\n\f7\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n15\n\nbias, many of the remaining SNe observations are located in a region of sky antipodal from the\nhighly-observed field; any vector or tensor contribution to cosmic dynamics will be dominated\nby dipole and quadrupole terms, and as such be seen with equal or opposite magnitude in the\nantipodal direction (that is, if we observe a change in Q of \u2206Q along the xi direction, we should\nexpect a change of \u2212\u2206Q in the event of a vector contribution, or \u2206Q in the event of a tensor\ncontribution, along the \u2212xi direction).\nThere is, furthermore, no SNe data whatsoever from above Dec +62\u25e6or below Dec \u221237\u25e6 . The\nauthors of [58] note a variation in the apparent Hubble parameter for galaxies in this equatorial\nband (no WiggleZ region lies further north than Dec +8\u25e6 or Dec \u221219\u25e6); variation to the Hubble\nflow could potentially be even greater outside this region. There is also no evaluation of whether\nthe Hubble flow remains isotropic beyond z = 0.3 [77].\nIndeed, Zehavi et. al. comment[89] on the lack of sky coverage in their analysis of local Hubble\nflows, noting that \"sparse sampling and the incomplete sky coverage (especially at low Galactic\nlatitudes) may introduce a bias in the peculiar monopole due to its covariance with higher multipoles\". While the fact of greater redshift in the range where acceleration can be measured should\novercome the peculiar velocities of galaxies, the data problem remains.\n\n7\n\nConclusions\n\nMany reasonable constraints prevent a full-sky survey of supernovae. In the optical band, much\nof the sky is obscured by the \"zone of avoidance\" created by the plane of our own galaxy[63].\nThe so-called \"Great Attractor\", certain to be a region of particularly high peculiar velocities and\ntherefore great shifts in the apparent Hubble parameter, lies in this zone[64]. Furthermore, with\nonly a single space-based optical observatory (the Hubble Space Telescope) operating, detailed\nobservation of the sky is restricted to those latitudes accessible by ground-based observatories,\nnone of which are located in Arctic latitudes. However, the directional deficit of SNe surveys,\naggregated together, cannot be ignored.\nIn the light of Tegmark et. al.'s discovery[28] of a preferred axis to the CMB quadrupole, and\nLand & Maguiejo's subsequent observation[32] of a preferred axis in higher multipole moments\naligned with the the quadrupole (the so-called \"Axis of Evil\"), the default assumption should be\nthat anisotropic acceleration is not ruled out. Indeed, the prominent CMB \"Cold Spot\"[34] falls\nwithin the highly-observed field, although no surveys or SNe are located exactly in its direction.\nAs such, Wagoner's assertion of the cosmological principle as \"statistically valid\"[45] has been\nmisapplied by analysts of acceleration data. A tensorial theory of cosmic acceleration would preserve homogeneity, in the sense that every observer sees \"the same version of cosmic history\"[21],\nat the expense of isotropy in the form of spherical symmetry.\nMore fundamentally, all studies of cosmic acceleration to date operate on the assumption that\nacceleration is isotropic, that is, that the acceleration field is equal in every direction, and therefore\nmust be explained either by a cosmological constant or a scalar field. As M\u00f6rtsell and Clarkson\nnote, \"[a]t best this gives a small error to all our considerations; at worst, many of our conclusions\nmight be wrong\"[61]. In particular, the data as presented cannot distinguish between a scalarfield theory of acceleration, a vector-field theory of acceleration, a cosmological constant theory\nof acceleration, and a time-dependent tensor-field theory of acceleration.\nMeanwhile, the simplest theory of acceleration, a cosmological constant, is challenged on two\nfronts: not only is \u03a9\u039b 's value far out of line with that predicted by theory[72], but while its\n\n\f7\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n16\n\nequation of state is close to wX = \u22121 measurements have tended to favor a value slightly smaller\nthan -1.\nIt is interesting to note that when \u03a9K is evaluated, supernova data favor a closed universe\n(although always in a manner compatible with a flat universe); this conclusion is consistent with\nthe curvature parameter evaluated by WMAP[62].\n\n7.1\n\nRecommendations\n\nIn light of these weaknesses of the current information on cosmic acceleration, the following\nprogram is recommended:\nThe data already in hand should be re-evaluated to look for signs of angular dependence in the\nHubble parameter. In particular, the SNLS fields 2 and 3 and the \"gold\" sample fields should\nbe examined in and of themselves in order to build up a map of H as a function of both z and\ndirection in the sky. The rejection of certain SNe in [51] should be re-evaluated in light of possible\ninadvertent obscuring of evidence for angular dependence in H.\nAnalyses of SNe data should always consider the possibility of a closed or open universe as well\nas a flat one.\nAdditional SNe surveys for redshifts .15 < z < 2 should be carried out in unexamined areas of sky\nnot obscured by the plane of the galaxy, such as for example the celestial north and south poles.\nThe optimal region for these surveys is in rings located 90\u25e6 from the center of the highly-observed\nfield, which will maximize the difference in the event of a tensor-field (that is, gravitational-wave)\nacceleration.\nIn light of this need and the lack of ground-based observatories, as well as the Zone of Avoidance,\npriority should be given to the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (\"WFIRST\") project[65],\nwhich incorporates the Super Nova/Acceleration Probe[66, 67] and Joint Dark Energy Mission[68,\n69]. This telescope is currently scheduled to be launched in 2016.\nAs WiggleZ continues, its data on galactic redshifts should be examined for angular dependence\nas well. The completion of WiggleZ will provide invaluable information on baryon acoustic\noscillations which will make possible the charting of the history of H and Q at much higher\nredshifts than is possible through the examination of supernova data.\nZhao et al. have also noted the possibility of using the Einstein telescope as an instrument for\nexamining dark energy through the use of gravitational wave emissions from colliding binary\nobjects as a \"standard siren\" analogous to the standard candle of type Ia SNe[111]. The largest\nbinary systems, in the period prior to merger, could be parameterized by radio telescopy[116].\nCooray and Caldwell[102], implicitly identifying the same problem of lack of angular coverage as\nwe note herein, propose a program of near-redshift surveys covering a large but practical area of\nsky which could also provide the relevant information with existing facilities.\nOverall, the need is underscored for new theories of acceleration, particularly ones that attempt\nto explain acceleration through the action of tensor perturbations in a closed universe. Wagoner's\nformula (equation 18) and its generalizations must be generalized further, to take into account\nthe possibility of anisotropic fields as the cause of anisotropic cosmic acceleration.\n\n\f17\n\nPart III\n\nThe Bianchi IX cosmology\nIn pursuit of a theory within the context of unmodified general relativity which can explain\ncosmic acceleration while remaining compatible with the cosmic microwave background, we wish\nto relax as few constraints on our cosmological model as necessary. Therefore while having\nsacrificed the requirement of isotropy in the sense of spherical symmetry in the dark energy field,\nwe wish to retain a stronger[2, ss. 116] condition of the Copernican principle on our space, that\nof homogeneity[4, Chap. 13 sec. 1]. It is also desirable to have a model whose limiting case is\na Friedmann cosmology, in order to explain the almost-isotropic (that is, almost-Friedmannian)\ncharacter of the CMB. Furthermore, a model which is spatially closed, in order to match models\nfavored by CMB and SNe data, is desirable; such a model would, if complying with all other\nconditions, have a flat universe as a limiting case in the limit of an infinitely large radius of\ncurvature.\nBianchi showed[70] that there exists exactly one homogeneous6 space with a closed Friedmann\nuniverse as a limiting case: the Bianchi type IX cosmology, for short \"Bianchi IX\".\n\n8\n\nThe Bianchi classification scheme\n\nBianchi observed that all three-dimensional homogeneous spaces could be classified into nine\ntypes, based on categorization of the symmetries, that is the Killing field, in each space. Behr\nnoted[71] that this categorization scheme could be simplified to filling a parameter space of four\nparameters: one running over the real numbers and three reducible to the sign function sgn (x).\n2\n2\ni\nj\nConsider some space with\n\u0001 metric ds = dt \u2212 gij dx dx (that is, a space in Gaussian coordinates)\ni\nwhere gij = gij t, x . If the sub-space with metric tensor gij is homogeneous, then there\nexists a set of vectors that solve \u03bei;j + \u03bej;i = 0; these are the Killing vectors of the space[4].\nIn a homogeneous space, these vectors will (where [ , ] is a commutator) obey the commutation\nrelationship\n\n[\u03bei , \u03bej ] \u2261 \u03bei \u03bej \u2212 \u03bej \u03bei = C kij \u03bek\n\n(20)\n\nwhere in an homogeneous space, the object C kij is a constant pseudo-tensor, the \"structure constants\" of an homogeneous space, with the antisymmetry property C k[ij] = C kij [2, ss. 116].\nWe always have the freedom to perform separation of variables the functions gij ; let us do so by\ndefining the matrix \u03b3ab such that\n\u0001\n\u0001 (b)\n\u0001\n(a)\ngij t, xk = \u2212\u03b3ab (t) ei xk ej xk\n\n(21)\n\n6 A homogeneous space is a space such that for any two points in the space, there exists a geodesic, not\nnecessarily of finite length, connecting those two points.\n\n\f8\n\n18\n\nTHE BIANCHI CLASSIFICATION SCHEME\n(a)\n\n.7 The 3 \u00d7 3 matrix ei\n\n\u0001\nxk is a triad[2, 112, ss. 98]8 of vectors (\"frame vectors\") which solve\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(a) (b)\n\u03bek ei ej dxi dxj = 0\n\n(22)\n\n(in the language of linear algebra, the quantity eai dxi is a one-form on a homogeneous space).\n(a)\n\nFurthermore, define the matrix ei(a) such that ei(a) = ej\n(b)\n\u03b4(a) .\n\n(b)\n\n= \u03b4ji ; from this it follows that ei(a) ei\n\n=\n\nFrom these relationships we can transform between any tensor and its decomposition into\n\nm\ntriads by saying that for some tensor Aij11ij22ij33...i\n...jn ,\n\n(a) (a) (a) ...(a)m\n\nm\n1\n2\n3\nAij11ij22ij33...i\n...jn = A(b) (b) (b) ...(b)\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nn\n\n\u0010\n\n1\n2\n3\nm\nei(a)\nei(a)\nei(a)\n. . . ei(a)\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nm\n\n\u0011\u0010\n\n(b)\n\n(b)\n\n(b)\n\n(b)\n\nej1 1 ej2 2 ej3 3 . . . ejn n\n\n\u0011\n\n(23)\n\n; therefore in an homogeneous space we can perform separation of variables on the partial differential equations of general relativity and solve the time-dependent parts as ordinary differential\nequations.\nThe frame vectors obey the properties\n(a)\n\n(a)\n\n(b) (c)\n\nei,j \u2212 ej,i = C abc ei ej\n\n(24)\n\n[7].

Bianchi IX is the only\nhomogeneous closed cosmological model in the context of general relativity[104].\n7 Indices from the beginning of the Latin alphabet (a, b, c,...) denote triad indices; indices from the middle of the\nalphabet (i, j, k,...) denote regular indices.

In a co-moving coordinate system we quickly arrive at the following\nset of Einstein equations:\n\n\u0002\n\n1\nt\u22122 = k (\u01eb + 3p)\n2\n1\n\u22122\n(p1 + p2 + p3 \u2212 1) p1 t = k (p \u2212 \u01eb)\n2\n1\n\u22122\n(p1 + p2 + p3 \u2212 1) p2 t = k (p \u2212 \u01eb)\n2\n1\n\u22122\n(p1 + p2 + p3 \u2212 1) p3 t = k (p \u2212 \u01eb)\n2\n\n(p1 + p2 + p3 ) \u2212 p21 + p22 + p23\n\n\u0001\u0003\n\n(28)\n(29)\n(30)\n(31)\n\n. These equations necessitate either an isotropic but unphysical (p = \u01eb) universe or a vacuum\n(\u01eb = p = 0) universe, in which we have either the trivial solution p1 = p2 = p3 = 0 (Minkowski\nspace) or the more interesting solution\np1 + p2 + p3 = p21 + p22 + p23 = 1\n. This solution admits a parametrization of p1 , p2 , p3 such that (if we choose p1 \u2264 p2 \u2264 p3 )\n\n(32)\n\n\f9\n\n20\n\nTHE KASNER UNIVERSE\n\np1 = \u2212 u/ 1 + u + u2\n\n\u0001\n\np2 = (1 + u) / 1 + u + u2\n\n\u0001\n\np3 =u (1 + u) / 1 + u + u\n\n2\n\n(33)\n\u0001\n\nwhere u > 0; these relations have the nice symmetry property that pi (u) = pi (1/u).\n\n9.1\n\nScale factor\n\nThe scale factor a does not necessarily have an intrinsic meaning, but instead compares distances\nas a function of time. In an isotropic cosmology such as the Friedmann model a can be given a\nreal geometric meaning; in an open or closed Friedmann\nuniverse, the scale factor appears simply\n\u0001\nin the Ricci curvature of space Rji = 2K/a2 \u03b4ji and as such can be regarded as the radius of\ncurvature of the universe. In particular, in a closed isotropic universe a can be considered to\nhave the direct physical meaning of the radius of curvature of the spherical space, so in a closed\nuniverse one could meaningfully say \"the radius of the universe is a\".\nWhen space is no longer isotropic, the definition of scale factor breaks down. It is, of course,\npossible to define any positive function as \"the\" scale factor. Grishchuk et al.[10, section 4], for\nexample, use a metric\n\n1 2 2\u03b1\na e\n4\n1 2 2\u03b2\na e\n4\n1 2 2\u03b3\na e\n4\n\n\u03b311 =\n\u03b322 =\n\u03b333 =\n\n(34)\n\nand propose the definition\n\na2 \u2261\n\n1\n\u03b3ab \u03b7 ab\n12\n\n(35)\n\nin the context of a vacuum cosmology, motivated by the coincidence of this definition of the scale\nfactor with one the authors introduce in separating the Bianchi IX metric into background and\ngravitational-wave parts. The authors also discuss a definition of scale factor such that\n1/3\n\na2 \u2261 (det \u03b3ab )\n\n(36)\n\n. This definition has the advantage that it relates the scale factor to a definite physical quantity,\na volume element, but it contains a deeper flaw: with such a definition in place the Einstein\nequations admit no solution other than the background solution at quadratic and higher orders.\nIf we define the quantity\n\n\u03b4 \u2261\u03b1+\u03b2+\u03b3\n\n(37)\n\n\f9\n\n21\n\nTHE KASNER UNIVERSE\n\nthen\n1/3\n\na2 \u2261 (det \u03b3ab )\n\n=\u21d2 e\u03b4 = 1 =\u21d2 \u03b4 = 0\n\n(38)\n\n. In either case, though, discussion of definitions of a attempt to solve a problem that does not\nexist. The question of what definition of scale factor to select is analogous to the question of\nwhich of the orthocenter, incenter or circumcenter of a triangle is the \"true\" center. Consequently,\nattempting to extract a single scale factor \u2013 and thus a single Hubble parameter or a single\ndeceleration parameter \u2013 from anisotropic Einstein equations is a fool's errand.\nWe can, if we wish, split the metric (34) into isotropic and anisotropic parts by noting that the\nquantity aF e\u03b4 is isotropic and that any two of the quantities \u03b1\u2212\u03b2, \u03b1\u2212\u03b3 and \u03b2 \u2212\u03b3 combined with\naF e\u03b4 contain all the information needed to describe the metric[22]; pursuing this route would be\na distraction from our main task.\nInstead, let the notion of scale factor a, Hubble parameter H and deceleration parameter Q be\ngeneralized. In a homogeneous cosmology with a diagonal metric, define the following matrices:\nthe generalized scale factor,\n\naab\n\n\uf8eb\n\n1/2\n\n(\u03b311 )\n\uf8ec\n\u2261\uf8ed\n0\n0\n\n0\n1/2\n(\u03b322 )\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n\uf8f7\n0\n\uf8f8\n1/2\n(\u03b333 )\n\n(39)\n\n(recalling that non-integer powers of a matrix are not defined, so we could not simply say aab \u2261\n1/2\n(\u03b3ab ) ). In a Bianchi I cosmology only, from this definition we can then define the redshift\nmatrix (in homogeneous cosmologies other than Bianchi I the geodesic equations are non-linear;\nsee Part IV):\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec\nzab \u2261 aac (\u03b7R ) abc (\u03b7E ) \u2212 \u03b4ab = \uf8ed\n\na11 (tR )\na11 (tE )\n\n0\n\n\u22121\n\n0\na22 (tR )\na22 (tE )\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n0\n\u22121\n\n0\na33 (tR )\na33 (tE )\n\n\u22121\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(40)\n\nwhere the subscript R denotes the function evaluated at the time of observation of light, and\nE denotes the function evaluated at the time of emission; and finally the generalized Hubble\nparameter and deceleration parameter:\n\nHab\n\n\uf8eb\n\u022711 /a11\n1 d\n0\nln \u03b3ab = \uf8ed\n\u2261\n2 dt\n0\n\n\uf8eb\n2\n\u00e411 a11 / (\u022711 )\nd\nac\na\nb\n\uf8ed\nQa \u2261 H \u03b7bc \u2212 \u03b4b = \u2212\n0\ndt\n0\n\n0\n\u022722 /a22\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n\uf8f8\n0\n\u022733 /a33\n\n0\n2\n\u00e422 a22 / (\u022722 )\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n\uf8f8\n0\n2\n\u00e433 a33 / (\u022733 )\n\n(41)\n\n(42)\n\n. This approach is essentially a generalization of that developed by Barrow in [22]; the object\n(41) is closely related to the shear tensor[21, 26]. The practical purpose of these definitions is to\n\n\f9\n\n22\n\nTHE KASNER UNIVERSE\n\nprovide a mathematical description of observed quantities; let ei be a unit vector pointing in the\ndirection of observation.

Examination of the observational consequences of the Kasner universe provides an illustrative example\nof potential consequences of anisotropy in other cosmologies.\n\nExpansion\nMisner, Thorne & Wheeler argue[76] that the Kasner universe is expanding, as the volume element\nis always increasing:\ndV\nd\n=\ndt\ndt\n\nq\nd p1 +p2 +p3 \u0001 1 2 3\nkgij kdx1 dx2 dx3 =\ndx dx dx = dx1 dx2 dx3\nt\ndt\n\n(45)\n\n. However, as noted above there is no unique way to define the scale factor. In terms of the\naveraged quantity defined in (44) we have\n\n\u0101 =\n\n1 p1\n(t + tp2 + tp3 )\n3\n\n(46)\n\nwhich, when we expand around t = 1, is approximately\n\n\u0101 (t \u2248 1) \u2248\n\n\u0001\n1\n(2 + t) + O t3\n3\n\n(47)\n\n. But in the limit of t small, we have\n\n\u0101 \u2248\n\n1 p1\nt\n3\n\n(48)\n\n, which is clearly a decreasing function; so the Kasner universe is not unambiguously expanding.\n\n\f9\n\n23\n\nTHE KASNER UNIVERSE\n\nRedshift\nRedshift in a Kasner universe is given by\n(tR /tE )p1 \u2212 1\n0\np\ni\n0\n(tR /tE ) 2 \u2212 1\nzj = \uf8ed\n0\n0\n\uf8eb\n\n1\nz\u0304 =\n3\n\n\u0014\u0012\n\ntR\n\u22121\ntE\n\n\u0013p1\n\n+\n\n\u0012\n\ntR\n\u22121\ntE\n\n\u0013p2\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n\uf8f8\n0\np\n(tR /tE ) 3 \u2212 1\n+\n\n\u0012\n\ntR\n\u22121\ntE\n\n\u0013p3 \u0015\n\n(49)\n\n(50)\n\n.

Moreover, even though acceleration along two axes is negative in the least-anisotropic Kasner\nuniverse, the impact of the positive-accelerating direction is such that the isepitach10 of zero\nacceleration, the boundary an observer sees on the sky between regions where objects accelerate\nand objects decelerate, is a circle 83\u25e6 from the axis of acceleration; only less than 8% of the sky\nappears close to \"normal\" to an observer expecting to record a Friedmann universe!\nWhile the vacuum Kasner universe is ruled out as a possible cosmology both for reasons of the\nCMB, which appears isotropic to a high degree[16], and due to the Hubble flow, which appears\nisotropic to the limit of the peculiar motions of galaxies below z = 0.3 [77], the surprising\ndifficulties in distinguishing between its dynamics and that of a Friedmann universe serve as a\nreminder that sampling of cosmological parameters must be done in an unbiased fashion and that\nisotropy must be tested rather than assumed. The Kasner universe also has an application as\na limiting case of the BKL universe[74], to which it appears identical for observers looking over\na period of time that is small compared to the radius of curvature of the universe. Finally, the\nanisotropic Kasner universe serves as a limiting case to some types of cosmology described by\nthe Bianchi IX model.\n\n10\n\nGravitational wave nature of Bianchi IX\n\nThe Bianchi IX has been considered by cosmologists repeatedly since the establishment of general\nrelativity to provide possible explanations for cosmological phenomena.\nBelinsky, Khalatnikov and Lifshitz discussed[74] a Bianchi IX cosmology (the \"BKL cosmology\")\nwhich undergoes several \"bounces\" as it evolves \u2013 rather than expanding from or converging to\na point, it contracts along one axis while expanding along two others until the smallest metric\ncomponent reaches a minimum value, at which point the axes swap roles. Misner[73] discussed\na related form of Bianchi IX universe as the \"mixmaster universe\", pursuing an resolution to the\nhorizon problem through the non-linearity of the Bianchi IX cosmology; through the mechanism\nof bounces, all parts of the universe are brought into causal connection. Bouncing vacuum cosmologies are, like the vacuum Kasner universe, intrinsically highly anisotropic; while in the long\nrun they tend to act isotropically due to the back-reaction of matter[75, 76] they will still exhibit\nstrong CMB anisotropy[19]. Supernova data ([1, 48] etc.) and CMB data on the value of \u03a9M\n([31] etc.) coupled with the existence of high-redshift objects[72] rule out bouncing cosmologies\nto a high degree of confidence.\nThe BKL cosmology undergoes anisotropic acceleration (see section 9.2). Meanwhile, numerical\nmodeling has suggested[98] that a matter-filled Bianchi IX universe will also undergo periods of\nacceleration. Therefore, we have good reason to suppose that a property of Bianchi IX may be to\ngenerate anisotropic acceleration, and that consequences of the Bianchi IX cosmology may reveal\na dark energy candidate with none of the failings of scalar or exotic models.\nWheeler showed[78] that an almost-isotropic Bianchi IX universe admitted a weak tensorial perturbation that took the form of a wave (that is, solving an equation of the form f \u0308+nf (t) = g (t)).\nGrishchuk et. al. were able to generalize this result[10]:\nThe Bianchi IX space has frame vectors\n10 A neologism denoting a path of constant acceleration, similar to \"isobar\" or \"isochor\", from Greek \"epitachounse\", acceleration.\n\n\f26\n\n10 GRAVITATIONAL WAVE NATURE OF BIANCHI IX\n\ne1i = cos x3 ,\n\nsin x1 sin x3 , 0)\n\ne2i = \u2212 sin x3 ,\n\nsin x1 cos x3 , 0)\n\ne3i\n\n(61)\n\n1\n\n= (0,\n\ncos x , 1)\n\n.

A similar property for open spaces is true of the\nBianchi type VII models.[19]12\nLifshitz, in his development of the theory of cosmological perturbations[75, 79, 2, ss. 115], claims\nthat tensorial perturbations, including gravitational waves, can only have diminishing effect over\ntime. Lifshitz is, however, considering only the class of local tensorial perturbations.\nIn contrast, the gravitational waves in Bianchi IX will have wavelengths comparable to the radius\nof curvature of the universe. Kristian and Sachs note[25] that the wavelength of cosmic shear\n(and thus, all else being equal, of cosmological gravitational waves) must be at least 2 \u00d7 1010\nyears \u2013 longer than the Hubble radius[16] \u2013 and could potentially be far longer (see section 17).\nWe will consider first the regime of weak gravitational waves, in an almost-isotropic universe,\nand then \"quasi-isotropic\" waves: that is, the regime in which components of the metric evolve\nat equal powers of t.\n11 a has been scaled here\nF\n12 We could also choose to\n\nto equal 1\ninterpret Bianchi I as the degenerate case of a flat universe containing gravitational\nwaves of infinite wavelength with n = 0. The Kasner universe, however, is not such a universe: all the anisotropy\nis governed by a single parameter, u, so the system has an insufficient number of degrees of freedom. The Kasner\nuniverse is more like the Taub universe[108].\n\n\f10 GRAVITATIONAL WAVE NATURE OF BIANCHI IX\n\n10.1\n\n27\n\nEinstein equations in the tetrad formalism\n\nFor a metric g\u03b1\u03b2 , let the space-space part of the metric be decomposed as in (21).

The term governed by c1 is a \"removable\" perturbation, that is, one not arising from a physical\nphenomenon but from small changes in our selection of the scale factor. Grishchuk, Doroshkevich & Iudin argue[10], and Grishchuk later proves in the case of high-frequency gravitational\nwaves[103], that the the removable perturbation arises in the transformation from t -time to conformal time, and represents a small change in the value of \u03b7 \u2013 that is, from the constant that\nhas been implicitly set to zero in the relationship dt = aF d\u03b7 so that t = 0 coincides with the\nmetric singularity from aF (0) = 0. This coincides with the argument made by Bardeen[105]\nwith regard to scalar and vector perturbations with wavelengths longer than the Hubble radius;\nBardeen recommends a gauge choice minimizing shear. We always have the freedom to set c1 to\nzero but do not do so yet.

A general solution for any constant equation of state, in\nterms of orthogonal polynomials in a, exists but is far too cumbersome to be of practical use\nin this work. We introduce the notation C\u03b11,1 etc. to be read in the following way: C\u03b12,1 is\nan arbitrary constant associated with the function \u03b1, the first index denoting the mode of the\nsolution (1 for growing, 2 for decaying), the second index denoting the order of the constant in\nan expansion assuming \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 \u226a 1.

It is common to refer to the decaying \"cos\" mode of these gravitational waves as \"singularitydestroying\"[10], in that they diverge as \u03b7 \u2192 0, which could seem at first to imply lim \u03b3ab \u2192 \u221e.\n\u03b7\u21920\n\nIt is worth remembering that as the functions \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 appear in the metric as exponents, that is,\n\u03b311 = a2F e2\u03b1 etc., decaying functions are not necessarily \"singularity-destroying\" for the following\nreasons:\n\u2022 their divergence must overcome the convergence of the Friedmannian term, which in the\ncase of weak waves will occur when w \u2264 2/3 but not generally;\n\u2212y\n\n\u2022 functions of the form e\u2212x for x < 0, y < 0 are non-analytic near x = 0, that is, they are\nnot described by convergent Taylor series in that region.\nAs C\u03b12,1 + C\u03b22,1 + C\u03b32,1 = 0, either one or two decaying terms preserve the t = 0 singularity\nwhen the removable perturbation is removed, in a manner analogous to that found in the Kasner\nuniverse, in the case of weak gravitational waves (although the price of this is a divergence later).\nWhen discussing high-frequency, localized waves, it is easy to define an amplitude of the waves\nby (for example) normalizing a root-mean-square value over the wave's period. In the case of\ncosmological gravitational waves however this procedure is not possible in an absolute sense due\nto the diverging character of the decaying mode. Fortunately, mathematical conditions on the\nrelation of linear-order terms to quadratic-order terms revealed at quadratic order (see section\n11.4) cause the term \"weak\" to give itself an objective meaning. If we wish to normalize the\ngrowing modes, they have the following RMS values:\n#1/2\n\"\n\u02c6 (1+3w)\u03c0/2\n2\n2\nRMS\ny1 d\u03b7\n(162)\ny1\n\u2261\n(1 + 3w) \u03c0 0\nradiation,RMS \u221a\ny1\n= 3\n(163)\n\u221a\nmatter,RMS\ny1\n= 259 \u2248 16.1\n(164)\n.\nIt is interesting to note that in matter, the decaying \"cos\" mode of \u03b11 , \u03b21 , \u03b31 has the same\n\u03b7-dependence as the removable perturbation; a cosmologist attempting to remove what they\nassume, based on an incomplete picture of the sky, to be a removable perturbation may inadvertently be suppressing evidence of a gravitational wave!\nFinally, the gravitational energy-momentum tensor's (entirely removable) components read, to\nlinear order:\n\n9+9w\nc1\ncos x (csc x) 1+3w\n2\nai\n9+9w\nc1\n=3w (1 + w) 2 cos x (csc x) 1+3w\nai\n\nk\u01ebg(1) =3 (1 + w)\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nkpg(1) = kpg(1) = kpg(1)\n\n(165)\n(166)\n\nwhile the back-reaction of the gravitational waves at linear order gives us matter EMT components which vary from background by:\n5+9w\n\nq1 = \u22123 (1 + w) c1 cos x (csc x) 1+3w\n\n(167)\n\n\f37\n\n11 EINSTEIN EQUATIONS FOR BIANCHI IX\n\n; when removable perturbations have been removed, first-order weak gravitational waves have no\neffect on the distribution of matter.\n\n11.4\n\nSolutions at quadratic order\n\nThe Einstein equations to quadratic order read:\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n2 cot x\u03b42\u2032 + 3 (1 + w) csc2 x \u2212 2 \u03b42\n\u03b1\u2032\u20322 + cot x (2\u03b1\u20322 + \u03b42\u2032 ) + 8\u03b12 \u2212 4\u03b42\n\n\u03b22\u2032\u2032 + cot x (2\u03b1\u20322 + \u03b42\u2032 ) + 8\u03b22 \u2212 4\u03b42\n\n\u03b32\u2032\u2032 + cot x (2\u03b32\u2032 + \u03b42\u2032 ) + 8\u03b32 \u2212 4\u03b42\n\n.

It is particularly encouraging that both growing and decaying modes\ncontribute to acceleration to their lowest orders in \u03b7.\n\n\f11 EINSTEIN EQUATIONS FOR BIANCHI IX\n\n11.7\n\n49\n\nBack-reaction\n\nOf interest in discussing the problem of acceleration is the effective equation of state of the\ngravitational waves' contribution to the energy density. Empirically, the equation of state of\ndark energy seems to be close to wX = \u22121 (see section 6), where the quantity wx is related\nto the source of the energy such that the source evolves with regard to the scale factor at a\nrate of a\u22123(1+wX ) . As noted in (section 9.1) there is no unique way to define the scale factor;\nbut a condition of quasi-isotropy is that expansion in every direction in the current epoch is\nproportional, that is, that they evolve as the same power of time. If the decaying mode of\nthe cosmological gravitational wave is weak, then this evolution will be proportional to the\nFriedmannian scale factor.\nTo quadratic order, (119) reads\n\u22122\n2\nk\u01eb(2)\ng = 3 (1 + w) aF csc x\u03b42\n\n(251)\n\nq(2) = \u2212 (1 + w) a\u22122\nF \u03b42\n\n(252)\n\nand so by (134)\n\n. When the growing mode is dominant, \u03b42 is always positive in a matter-dominated universe, and\ntherefore q(2) is negative and thus the back-reaction appears to have negative energy density; a\nsignificant \"mixed\" \u03c3 * \u03c4 term, however, can easily introduce intervals where q(2) > 0.\nIn a matter-dominated universe and when the growing mode is dominant, q(2) \u221d \u03b7 \u22122 which, if\nthe universe is evolving with a scale as aF \u221d \u03b7 2 , implies an equation of state for the back-reaction\nof wX = \u22121/3 (as compared to an equation of state for a cosmological constant of wX = \u22121).\nWhile no investigation of the equation of state of dark energy includes this value within its highest\nconfidence interval, measurements of wX remain tentative, with large errors and high sensitivity\nboth to single data points and to the algorithm for curve-fitting models to the data (see section\n6).\nThe dominant term in (119) is the a\u2032F /aF -term. This stands in stark contrast to the commonlyconsidered case of gravitational waves in a background so slowly moving compared to the period\nof the waves that \u0227F \u2248 0, in which instance the quadratic combination of first-derivative terms\ndominates.\nIn regimes of stronger growing-mode gravitational waves, though, the scale factor as defined in\n(39) will be more dominated by terms of higher, even order and so aab \u221d \u03b7 4 or higher. As the\ngrowing mode increases in strength, the equation of state decreases asymptotically toward a limit\nof wX = \u22121; if the scale factor grows as \u03b7 2s , the equation of state for the back-reaction is given\nby wX = (1/3s) \u2212 1. As acceleration is empirically Q0 = \u22120.6, this implies that in real life the\ngravitational wave strength is of order unity and therefore the effective equation of state is close\nto \u22121. Thus, the quasi-isotropic Bianchi IX model with strong growing-mode gravitational waves\nand weak or zero decaying-mode waves is compatible with the observed data on the equation of\nstate of dark energy, without the invocation of a cosmological constant; the theory would be\ninvalidated by definitive measurements of wX < \u22121.\nIn any case, the fact of wX < 0 allows us to draw a conclusion regarding cosmic evolution. [76]\nnotes Kasner-like cosmologies go through two stages of evolution:\n\n\f12 CONCLUSIONS\n\n50\n\n1. A \"vacuum\" stage, where matter's influence is, due to its evolution as a\u22124 , weak compared\nto the influence of the anisotropic expansion and contraction, influence which, in light\nof (section 10), we now understand to be the result of gravitational waves in the BKL\nuniverse;\n2. a \"matter\" stage, where expansion isotropizes[106] and is driven by, first relativistic (w =\n1/3), then cold, non-relativistic (w = 0) matter. Formally, the contribution of curvature\nto cosmic evolution becomes important in this era (wK = \u22121/3), but as the influence of\ncurvature will be isotropic in Bianchi IX and the radius of curvature is very large compared\nto the Hubble radius (see section 17), curvature will not have a practical influence on\nobservations in and of itself.17 To this second stage we can add a third stage:\n3. A \"dark energy\" stage, in which growing modes of the cosmological gravitational waves\nwhich drove the initial isotropy return as the dominant influence on cosmic evolution.\n\n11.8\n\nAmplification of gravitational waves\n\nGrishchuk observed[8] that when the background of a cosmology containing gravitational waves\nvaries rapidly, weak gravitational waves can be amplified where they would otherwise, in a slowlymoving background, decay rapidly[79]. With regard to the Bianchi IX cosmology this is significant\nas when the growing mode of a cosmological gravitational wave dominates, the leading term\nin the gravitational energy density is of the form (a\u2032F /aF ) \u03b42\u2032 = O (constant).\nCosmological\n\u0001\nobservations (see section 17) indicate the universe has \u03b7 < O 10\u22121 . In this regime, the\nterm a\u2032F /aF = cot (\u03b7/2) \u2248 2/\u03b7, which is dependent on the rate of change of the background,\nis arbitrarily large; therefore, weak waves may have an effect orders of magnitude greater than\ntheir amplitude. Similarly, the decaying mode of gravitational waves can have prominent or even\ndominant power in a sufficiently young universe even when the amplitude of the decaying mode\nis smaller than that of the growing mode.\n\n12\n\nConclusions\n\nSolutions have been presented for the gravitational wave equation for a Bianchi IX universe\nperturbed to quadratic order from the closed Friedmann case. Quadratic order is the limit of\nperturbation theory's applicability to explore nearly-Friedmannian Bianchi IX when decaying\nmodes are sufficiently strong that they are not negligible.\nAt quadratic order, the non-linear interaction of the gravitational waves produces isotropic\nchanges to dynamic quantities. While this isotropic change is likely to be dominated in any\nparticular direction by linear-order contributions from the gravitational waves, in the regime\nof strong gravitational waves they will become more important and potentially even dominant.\nWhere [98] discussed the possibility of acceleration in a non-vacuum Bianchi IX universe only\nqualitatively, we have shown it explicitly as well as illustrating a clear link between acceleration\nand the gravitational waves which are intrinsic to Bianchi IX in its full generality.\n17 Formally we can also say that, due to the action of proton decay and positron annihilation, after sufficient\ntime the w = 0 phase will return to a w = 1/3 phase where the universe is filled with neutrinos and photons.\nFollowing this period there will be another return to w = 0 as these free particles are absorbed by black holes.\nAs these black holes evaporate by the process of Hawking radiation, there will then be a final return to w = 1/3.\n[80] gives a popular-science presentation of the universe in these phases, but as it was written only shortly after\nthe discovery of acceleration its treatment of dark energy is highly speculative.\n\n\f51\nIt is curious to note that the order-\u03b7 2 approximation we have made in (section 11.5), \u03b1 and \u03b4\nin the normalization we have chosen take the form of Alexander polynomials[109, 110], although\nnot Alexander polynomials for any knot of fewer than 11 crossings. Whether this mathematical\nobservation is significant or coincidental is a subject for further debate, but as gravitational waves\nin Bianchi IX are moving equatorially around our background 3-sphere[10], and as a sub-class of\nknots (the \"torus knots\") are constructed by wrapping one 2-torus around another it is conceivable\nthere could be a connection.\nBack-reaction from growing modes of the gravitational waves appears to have negative energy\ndensity and an equation of state compatible with that observed for dark energy, especially in the\nregime of strong gravitational waves and quasi-isotropic expansion; when gravitational waves are\nstrong, they become the dominant contributor to the evolution of the cosmos in an era following\nthe era of matter domination.\nTherefore, from the perspective of cosmic dynamics, cosmological gravitational waves in a quasiisotropic Bianchi IX universe are a viable candidate for dark energy, without the invocation\nof a cosmological constant and without requiring any modification of the theory of relativity.\nAn analysis of the impact of these gravitational waves on the cosmic microwave background\nis necessary in order to determine whether constraints from the CMB are compatible with the\nobserved data on acceleration.\n\nPart IV\n\nThe Cosmic Microwave Background of a\nBianchi IX universe\nWhile long-wavelength gravitational waves can cause acceleration in a Bianchi IX universe, the\neffect of such waves must be compatible with the observed cosmic microwave background in order\nto represent a practical model for explaining observed acceleration.\nSachs & Wolfe initiated[23] the systematic study of the effect of perturbations on the CMB,\nfollowing a formalism developed by Kristian & Sachs[25]. Sachs & Wolfe's work developed the\ntheory of scalar, vector and tensor perturbations on the CMB in a flat almost-isotropic universe\nto first order.\nSachs & Wolfe's work was generalized by Anile & Motta[26] to the almost-isotropic closed and\nopen Friedmann cosmologies, again at first order. While Anile & Motta begin to consider the\nimpact of long-wavelength gravitational waves on the CMB, they choose to explore the impact of\nwaves with scales much smaller than the Hubble radius. Anile & Motta subsequently[27] ruled\nout the existence of these waves at significant strengths in the observable universe.\nDoroshkevitch, Lukash & Novikov considered the impact of an anisotropic universe on the CMB\nin the case of the Bianchi VII, VIII and IX models[19], and concluded that a Bianchi IX model\nwas potentially \"compatible with observations, only if there was some secondary heating of the\nintergalactic gas\". Doroshkevitch et al 's most important calculations are carried out on the\nassumption, then widespread, of \u03a9M \u2248 1 and as such are of limited applicability; interestingly,\nthough, in their conclusions they note that if \u03a9M < 1, \"\u2206T /T will be close to the maximum\nvalue only in a small 'spot' with an angular size \u03b8 \u2248 4\u03a9\" (where by \"small\" they give the example\n\n\f52\n\n13 GEODESIC EQUATIONS\nof \u03a9M \u2248 0.1 =\u21d2 \u03b8 \u2248 23\u25e6 ).\n\nSung & Coles analytically and computationally explore the impact of various unperturbed Bianchi\nmodels, including Bianchi IX, on the CMB[21]. They report the useful theorem that \"a gravitational field alone is not able to generate polarization\", but do not consider the general case of\nBianchi IX, only the isotropic case equivalent to the closed Friedmann universe.\n\n13\n\nGeodesic equations\n\nThe effect of the metric on the CMB is determined by examining the change in geodesics of light\nrays relative to an isotropic, background case. Let the subscript E denote a function evaluated at\nthe time of the emission of a photon, and the subscript R denote that function evaluated at the\ntime of the photon's reception.

While the WMAP team\nargue[17] that these phenomena are not of statistical significance, if a quasi-isotropic Bianchi\nIX universe could produce any of the perceived patterns it would point the way toward further\nobservational studies of the CMB to determine cosmological parameters, and establish the quasiisotropic Bianchi IX universe as a viable model for cosmology.\nIn all cases, we emphasize that the most likely explanation for any perceived pattern in the\nCMB which is not shown to be statistically significant is the null hypothesis: that is, the human\nperceptive phenomenon of pareidolia, the same phenomenon responsible for observing familiar\nshapes in clouds or the \"Man in the Moon\".\n\nCold spots, \"fingers\" and the \"Axis of Evil\"\nTwo compact, supposedly anomalous areas of low temperature have been noted in the CMB, the\nso called \"cold spots\".\nThe first of these (called Cold Spot I in [17]) is a region[31] covering approximately 15000 square\ndegrees in the direction of the galactic center, much of which is 194 microkelvin[28] colder than\nthe CMB mean temperature (\u2206T /TR = \u22127.12 \u00d7 10\u22125 ).\nParticularly noteworthy regarding Cold Spot I is its membership in one of four \"fingers\" spaced\nat roughly 90-degree angles around the galactic equator, intersticed by four areas of higher\n(\u2206T /TR = 7.12 \u00d7 10\u22125 ) temperature19 . Qualitatively, such a pattern is roughly consistent with\nthe expected pattern if two of the functions \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 > 0 and if two of the the principle axes of\nthe metric tensor lie on the axes of the cold and hot zones (implying the third axis points along\nthe \"Axis of Evil\", see below). The so-called \"Cold Spot II\" reported by Vielva et al.[34, 37] also\nforms part of these \"finger\" structures[17].\nCold Spot I also has the angular size [19] predicts for the observed value of \u03a9M \u2248 .3.\nDue to the coincidence of the cold spot with the direction of the galactic center, there are no\noptical observations in its direction (see figure 5), and therefore there is no data on cosmic\nacceleration in the direction of Cold Spot I.\n(Equation 286) implies that any cold spot resulting from anisotropy in the metric should be\naccompanied by an identical cold spot at a point antipodal to the original spot. Tegmark's\nexamination[28] of the one-year WMAP data on the CMB low-order multipoles revealed an\nalignment between the CMB quadrupole and octupole in the direction of (l, b) \u2248 (\u2212110\u25e6, 60\u25e6 )\nalong which the quadrupole is nearly zero, an axis which Land & Maguiejo found[32] extended to\nthe 16-pole and 32-pole as well; the alignment has been dubbed the \"Axis of Evil\". While examination of the three-year WMAP data[33] found the Axis of Evil to be of lower significance than\ninitially thought (94%-98%), it still persists; the WMAP team's discussion of the alignment[17,\npt. 7] admits the \"remarkability\" of this alignment and, while assigning its existence to chance,\ndoes not attempt to explain the \"Axis of Evil\" in full.\nThe Axis of Evil, which in equatorial coordinates[35, p. 43] lies close to RA 10:44 Dec +7.6\u25e6,\nfalls within the zone in which redshift data has been collected for measurement of the cosmic\n19 The\n\nCMB dipole is defined as such a way as to be traceless, so\n\n \u0301\n\n\u2206Tquadrupole /TR dS = 0.\n\n\f16 CONCLUSIONS\n\n58\n\ndeceleration parameter. To simplest linear approximation with a pure growing mode, (that is,\nthat the functions \u03b1 and \u03b1\u2032 are both small such that \u03b12 \u2248 0) this alignment rules out a CMB\narising from cosmological gravitational waves as a source of cosmic acceleration. However, the\nfact of the alignment of the quadrupole, octopole, 16-pole and 32-pole indicates that non-linear\ncontributions of gravitational waves to acceleration are not ruled out.\nThe question of the overall magnitude of the quadrupole, which is only 14% of the expected\nvalue[28, 38], has also been raised. The WMAP team[17, pt. 4] agree with Tegmark that\nthe depressed quadrupole falls within the 95% confidence interval for simulations of the CMB,\nbut do not attempt an explanation for the unusually strong octopole term. Long-wavelength\ngravitational waves can easily explain both through judicious choice the arbitrary constants\nC\u03b11,1 etc. in a manner compatible with the CMB. Efstathiou[29] supposes that the depressed\nquadrupole could be an indication of a closed universe; however the relationships he proposes\ngenerate zero contributions to the CMB power spectrum from the genuinely cosmological, intrinsic\nn = 3 waves found in Bianchi IX, and any observational test using his framework must rely on\ncorrect evaluation of gauge terms whose effective wavelengths must be far longer than the cosmic\nhorizon. Furthermore, Efstathiou's conclusion that a closed universe would automatically require\na scrapping of current inflationary models is contradicted by others; for example Guth argues\nthat a universe that is closed but with a very large radius of curvature is not ruled out[40].\nThe quasi-isotropic Bianchi IX model cannot provide an explanation for hemispherical dipole\nasymmetry claimed by Ericksen et. al.[39].\n\n16\n\nConclusions\n\nThe long-wavelength gravitational waves intrinsic to a quasi-isotropic Bianchi IX will cause a\nchange in the cosmic microwave background with a distinctive quadrupolar signature. A radiallysymmetric pattern of light deflections in the CMB resulting from shear may also be observed.\nThe almost-isotropic Bianchi IX model can be compatible with the CMB as observed, and can\nprovide an explanation for perceived anomalies observed in the CMB by COBE and WMAP.\nHowever, the existence of these anomalies beyond the level of statistical noise is not certain; a\npossible route of cross-disciplinary research is open in the form of examination of the phenomenon\nof pareidolia as applied to the CMB.\nModels of quasi-isotropic Bianchi IX relying on pure growing modes or pure decaying modes\nof the gravitational waves cannot simultaneously explain observed cosmic acceleration and the\nobserved cosmic microwave background. Research into the non-linear regime of the Bianchi IX\ncosmology may elucidate the existence of a model of an accelerating universe in which isotropy\nis almost preserved.\n\n\f59\n\nPart V\n\nAn accelerating Bianchi IX universe\npreserving an almost-isotropic CMB\nIn order for a Bianchi IX universe to both appear nearly isotropic in the cosmic microwave\nbackground and to accelerate through the existence of long-wavelength gravitational waves, it\nmust fulfill two conditions. The first is that the function k 0 (\u03b7R ) must have absolute value less\nthan the limit imposed by observations of the cosmic microwave background, \u2206T /TR . The\nsecond is that at least one of the functions Qba < 0. It is possible for both these conditions\nto be simultaneously filled while remaining compatible with other observational constraints on\ncosmological parameters.\nThe idea of long-wavelength gravitational waves causing anisotropy in the CMB has been proposed, but not applied to the Bianchi IX universe. Grishchuk & Zel'dovich consider the possibility of long-wavelength gravitational waves existing in a Friedmann universe without violating\nthe limits imposed by the CMB[41], but do not apply their work to the gravitational waves\nof cosmological character which appear in some homogeneous cosmologies. Campanelli et. al.\nsuggest that such a universe could exist and propose a Taub-type Bianchi I universe which also\nincludes anisotropic dark energy as an initial explanation for the observed CMB, complementing Rodrigues[113]. Critically, they do not consider gravitational waves as a generator of the\nanisotropy and treat the parameters of the Taub universe as if dark energy were simply established by fiat. Similarly, Kovisto and Mota[115] do not look beyond the Bianchi I model and\ninstead fall back on exotic theories to explain dark energy.\n\n17\n\nCosmological parameters\n\nWMAP[18, 16] has produced an all-sky survey of the CMB which, if the universe is almost\nFriedmannian, can be used to constrain cosmological parameters.\nLet the radius of curvature a0 and conformal time \u03b7 of the background Friedmann cosmology be\ntreated as a free parameters; assume a closed universe. The WMAP seven-year data gives\n\nH0 =70.4+1.3\n\u22121.4 km/s/Mpc\n\u03a9K = \u2212 .0025 \u00b1 0.0109\n\n(291)\n(292)\n\n(WMAP's analysis includes the value of \u03a9K measured by baryon acoustic oscillations reported\nin [101]). The radius of curvature, Hubble parameter and curvature energy density are related\nby\n\na0 = H0\u22121\n\nq\n\u2212\u03a9\u22121\nK\n\nwhile the Hubble parameter, radius of curvature and \u03b7-time are related by\n\n(293)\n\n\f18 COMPATIBILITY WITH THE REDSHIFT\n\nH0 a0 = cot (\u03b70 /2)\n\n60\n\n(294)\n\n.

Meanwhile, the ratio of Hubble radius to radius of curvature is at least\n\nH0 a0 \u2265 8.67\n\n(299)\n\nH0 a0 = 20.0\n\n(300)\n\nwith a best-fit value of\n\n. In other words, if the universe is closed, then the cosmological gravitational waves of the Bianchi\nIX cosmology are of much, much longer wavelength than the observable universe.\nFinally, from the value of the redshift of decoupling, zlast scattering = 1090, we can say by (19)\nthat\n\n\u03b7R /\u03b7E \u2248 33.0\n\n(301)\n\n. As the available data, including that from supernovae (see table 1), does not exclude a flat\nuniverse, we are always free, in developing the theory of Bianchi IX and acceleration, to set the\nparameter \u03b7 as close to zero as necessary; doing so will not, in and of itself, violate observations,\nbut will instead be constrained by the impact of the decaying mode of the gravitational waves\non the CMB.\n\n18\n\nCompatibility with the redshift\n\nOf all the observed cosmological parameters observed by WMAP and other probes of the CMB,\nthe ones that are directly observed are \u2206T /TR and zlast scattering . From these we can say that\n\n\f18 COMPATIBILITY WITH THE REDSHIFT\n\n61\n\nin the current epoch the universe appears isotropic and that its expansion since last scattering\nhas, on average to the present time, been isotropic; neither of these facts necessarily imply that\nthe overall expansion was isotropic at any time before the present.

While the values for the growing mode are far greater than those for what could be called\n\"weak\" waves (recalling the constraints of section 11.4), our educated estimate for C\u03b11,1 in\nthe growing-mode dominated regime aligns nicely with the necessary strong-wave growing-mode\nvalue for \u2206Q11 disregarding the CMB.

Thus, we have\nshown analytically that long-wavelength gravitational waves can explain cosmic acceleration if\nthat acceleration is anisotropic.\nWe can also make the following qualitative assessments about acceleration. Firstly, its timeevolution is non-monotonic. In the \u03b1 direction, the universe will at first exhibit slightly increased\ndeceleration, before starting to accelerate. In the \u03b2 and \u03b3 directions, deceleration will asymptotically increase toward infinity but then acceleration will decrease from infinity, quickly converging\non the strong-field value of Q22 = Q33 = \u22121. Acceleration in the \u03b1 direction begins at A\u03b7 \u2248 1.2 and\nthe universe accelerates in every direction after A\u03b7 \u2248 1.6; thus the supposition that acceleration\nis a recent phenomenon is supported.\nA universe that is accelerating in every direction is within the region allowed by the model.\nFigure (2) illustrates the evolution of the deceleration parameters as a function of time. The\nconstraints placed on the decaying mode in (section 17) and the upper limit on \u03b7R show that the\ndecaying mode of long-wavelength gravitational waves has not played a significant role in cosmic\nacceleration; in the epoch of last scattering, the deceleration parameter was almost isotropic and\nhad a close to Friedmannian value.\nWe now turn our attention to the preservation of the CMB. We have three equations in three\nunknowns, taking the lowest term in the decaying mode and the lowest two terms in the growing\n\n\f19 ACCELERATION IN THE BIANCHI IX UNIVERSE\n\n66\n\nFigure 2: Deceleration parameter versus time\n\nAlong one direction, the universe at first decelerates, then quickly begins accelerating.

In particular, if the ratio of\ngrowing mode to decaying mode is approximately equal for all three of \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 we always have\nsufficient freedom to choose a \u03b7 that reduces CMB variation to below the level of detectability, at\nthe expense of \"tuning\" the universe to place us as observers in the era when the CMB is nearly\nisotropic.\n\nCompatibility with an almost-isotropic Hubble flow\nThe objection could be raised that the necessity of the universe contracting along two axes\ndemands that a large region of the sky be blue-shifted, which would surely have been observed.\nThis problem can be made to vanish into statistical noise\nby the choice of a sufficiently small \u03b7\n\u0001\nas (223) implies aF H11 = a\u2032F /aF + \u03b1\u2032 \u2248 2 \u03b7 \u22121 + c\u03b1\n2 \u03b7 etc.\n\n\f20 CONCLUSIONS\n\n20\n\n68\n\nConclusions\n\n\u03b2 \u03b3\nIt is possible for a Bianchi IX universe with initial conditions c\u03b1\n0 , c0 , c0 \u223c 1 to display the\nacceleration observed in our universe while not only remaining compatible with the observed\nCMB but providing and explanation for potentially meaningful patterns in the CMB, specifically\nthe so-called \"Axis of Evil\" and its associated phenomena such as cold spots. These conditions\ncan be attained without additional constraints on the cosmological parameter of \u03a9K , a parameter\nwhich is subject to further scrutiny and potentially tightening toward the flat universe case of\n\u03a9K = 0.\n\nThe method of combining strong growing modes with linear-order weak decaying modes of cosmological gravitational waves is borne out by observational data, which imply a difference of at least\n17 orders of magnitude in amplitude between the growing and decaying modes. In the current\nepoch, decaying modes of cosmological gravitational waves can be neglected entirely. However,\nin the time close to last scattering, these modes may have participated at a strength comparable\nto the growing modes. Furthermore, the action of growing or decaying modes on their own is\nruled out as an explanation for acceleration as neither on its own can preserve the CMB.\nThe question of how the ratio of growing mode to decaying mode is equal along all three principle\naxes of the metric tensor is answered easily if we postulate that cosmological gravitational waves\npresent at the earliest moment in time were all in phase (the easiest way to do this is to postulate\nthat they consisted of pure growing modes). As the functions \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 would have all crossed\nthe boundary from a w = 1/3 medium to a w = 0 medium at the same time, they would thus\nhave remained in phase after last scattering, implying equal growing-to-decaying ratios for all\nthree functions. As this transition happened in the very young universe (\u03b7E . 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 ), the\ndecaying mode that exists after last scattering would be very small.\nThe nonlinearity of Bianchi IX causes growing modes with initial values of order unity to develop\nexponentially and cause very powerful effects. The structure of the equations also indicates that\nmultiple sets of initial conditions can lead to the same set of cosmological parameters. In light of\nthe requirement of this model that both strong growing modes and weak but non-zero decaying\nmodes of the gravitational waves exist, the possibility that these long-wavelength gravitational\nwaves constituted the \"pump field\" of inflation[103] in the early universe should be explored.\nThe model proposed can be tested and falsified by observation of acceleration in areas of the\nsky 90\u25e6 from the highly-observed field; in areas of the sky away from the currently-observed\nacceleration, we will see either a very large deceleration parameter or a negative one. From the\nanalysis of acceleration data in (Part II) it is easy to see that, in the current state of observations,\nthere are several possible areas of the sky where evidence of a gravitational-wave nature of cosmic\nacceleration could be sitting undetected.\n\n\f69\n\nPart VI\n\nConclusions\n21\n\nDirections for future research\n\nThe possibility of explaining cosmic acceleration through a Bianchi IX cosmological model opens\nup numerous possibilities for future research, both theoretical and observational.\nWhile the difficulties with carrying out a full-sky optical survey of supernovae are understandable,\nexperimental verification or falsification of a Bianchi IX model for acceleration requires nearly\nfull sky coverage at high z to discover or rule out regions of anisotropy in the acceleration\nfield. Infrared astronomy with wide sky coverage, for example WFIRST[65], presents the best\npossibility for these new observations through traditional astronomy. The Einstein telescope\nprovides the tantalizing possibility of independent verification of the properties of dark energy\nthrough the examination of gravitational radiation.[111]\nMeanwhile, the available supernova data can be re-examined for signs of acceleration, although\ngiven the comparatively small datasets in any particular area other than the highly-observed\nfield and the equatorial bias in the distribution of the data this re-examination is less likely to\nproduce definitive results. C\u00e9l\u00e9rier is justified in her criticisms[91] of the assumptions being made\nin proposed models of cosmological acceleration; it is curious that the authors if [89] reasoned,\nwith 44 low-z sources, that \"poor coverage at low and moderate Galactic latitudes [...] makes it\npractically impossible to distinguish between a peculiar monopole and a quadrupole\" but that\n[1], which shares two authors with [89], does not even mention the possibility of cosmographic\nbias in its smaller sample of high-z sources.\nConsideration should be given to the question of why cosmographic bias exists, and whether it\npoints to an unexpected privileging of the observer: namely, the fact that modern observatories\nare hosted only in regions of the Earth that can afford to host them.\nPerturbative methods for solving the Einstein equations for weak gravitational waves in Bianchi\nIX can be considered exhausted, having reached the limit of practical utility at quadratic order.\nFurther analytic explorations should concentrate on the quasi-isotropic approach. The fact of\nBianchi IX's easy reduction to a system of non-linear second-order ordinary differential equations\ncombined with the divergence of Taylor series describing strong gravitational waves point toward\neither a Fourier-series approach or numerical methods for further analysis; the likelihood of\nchaotic behavior[73] in Bianchi IX, though, merits caution in the selection of initial conditions\nfor any simulation.\nNumerical examination of the quasi-isotropic regime should also be pursued for a fuller exploration of the space allowing for anisotropic acceleration while preserving an almost-isotropic\ncosmic microwave background. The next generation of microwave anisitropy probe should settle the question of whether the \"Axis of Evil\" and similar phenomena are genuine artifacts or\nstatistical noise; in the meantime, the question of pareidolia in relation to the CMB has not\nbeen explored and deserves formal examination in order to raise awareness within the scientific\ncommunity of the issue.\nOverall, any theory is only as good as its ability to predict future results. Cosmic acceleration\nneeds to be more closely examined, not only for time dependence, but for spatial dependence,\n\n\f22 IMPLICATIONS OF THE BIANCHI IX COSMOLOGICAL MODEL\n\n70\n\nbefore any theory can emerge as preferred.\n\n22\n\nImplications of the Bianchi IX cosmological model\n\nSince the discovery of cosmic acceleration, a wide range of scalar theories, ranging from the\nmundane to the exotic, have been put forward to explain the phenomenon. While the fact of\nacceleration, the discovery of which was the logical culmination of the hunt for the \"missing mass\"\nof the universe above and beyond that provided by dark matter, necessarily implies the slaughter\nof at least one sacred cow, the community of physicists has no consensus over which should be\nsacrificed the most readily.\nAttempts to surrender homogeneity are physically the best-grounded but philosophically the\nmost rash. Certainly the idea of a purely homogeneous cosmology is an approximation; but a\nuniverse which is not on average homogeneous, that is, where the homogeneous regions are rare\nexceptions, is one in which cosmology as a science ceases to be possible. The \"Swiss cheese\"\nuniverse has the advantage of making use of a known, exact solution to the Einstein equations\nand at least avoids the exceptionalism of the \"Hubble bubble\" proposal, but defeats itself on the\ngrounds of testability.\nMeanwhile, postulation of exotic states of matter has been done too enthusiastically for the evidence available. The simple fact of noting that the available data on acceleration was anisotropic\nexposes as irrational exuberance the rush to explain the phenomenon through the medium of a\nsubstance which has never been seen or even indicated in the laboratory, and whose theoretical\njustification is far beyond testability. The willingness of many to see acceleration as a falsification of the theory of general relativity looks all the more bizarre when counterposed with the\nunwillingness to explore gravitational-wave solutions to the problem.\nThe objection could be raised that asserting acceleration to potentially be anisotropic, in the weak\nsense of the word \"isotropy\", violates the cosmological principle by saying that our telescopes are\nprivileged observers, in that our observational field happens to align with an axis of acceleration.\nThis is no more so true than the \"privilege\" hypothesized by, for example, Riess et. al. when\nthey assert, from a few dozen data points, that acceleration is a recent phenomenon, and that\nimplicitly we are privileged observers in time for taking up cosmology just as the universe has\nbegun to exhibit this behavior. While a cosmological constant is the simplest explanation for\nwX = \u22121 on mathematical grounds, the lack of physical justification for a non-zero cosmological\nconstant puts it in the same class as scalar-field theories. The simple fact is, wX = \u22121 is, in\nthe long run, the natural equation of state for any function which grows faster than the matterdriven terms in the background cosmology. The idea of the \"Big Rip\"[99], while intellectually\n(and emotionally) intriguing, makes the same mistake in the other direction, privileging observers\nto be alive just as the universe is beginning to tear itself apart. In this sense, a wX = \u22121 field\nis the best preserver of the cosmological principle, and when the cosmological constant has been\nexcluded the simplest explanation for acceleration comes from a tensorial field.\nSimilarly, when cosmic flatness is called into question \u2013 and it has never been and can never be\ndefinitively proven, it can only be disproven \u2013 the next-simplest model is the closed model. Recall\nthat the Bianchi models are distinguished by their symmetries, and of all the Bianchi models with\nFriedmann universes as special cases, Bianchi IX has the most symmetric symmetries, obeying a\n\"handedness\" rule students learn before their first year of university. The fact of this \"handedness\"\n\u2013 parity \u2013 may even provide a neat explanation of the CP violation in particle physics[100], as\nGrishchuk alluded to[10].\n\n\f22 IMPLICATIONS OF THE BIANCHI IX COSMOLOGICAL MODEL\n\n71\n\nThe least speculative fact revealed by the assessment of available acceleration data is that more\ndata is needed, from broader areas of the sky. The anticipated launch of WFIRST is likely to\nprove more momentous for cosmology than the flight of WMAP; WMAP largely reconfirmed\nwhat we already believed we knew, but WFIRST and SNAP will clearly illustrate how much\nwe do not know. We also need techniques to see deeper into the sky and measure the distanceredshift relationship further into the past; the standard ladder of baryon acoustic oscillations[101]\ncombined with better redshift data from WiggleZ may provide the necessary window.\nThat Bianchi IX could in principle contain accelerating regimes was never really in doubt. Numerical and qualitative analysis has indicated this ever since [10] noted that the vacuum equations\ncontained a regular minimum, implying a positive first derivative for the Hubble parameter. The\ncharacter of the acceleration has now been more properly investigated, bringing with it the possibility of a purely gravitational explanation for inflation, especially in light of the divergence of\n\u03b4 constructed only from growing modes in the radiation-dominated universe. An exploration of\nthe differences between Bianchi I and Bianchi IX in a universe filled with ultra-relativistic matter\ncould make Bianchi IX into a panacea for all the major problems of large-scale cosmology.\nThe unwillingness of the perturbed Bianchi IX cosmology to support decaying-mode gravitational\nwaves stronger than linear order is puzzling, especially as the BKL universe always has a divergent\nterm. The BKL universe, though, never reaches a singularity, and so the divergence of the a\ndecaying mode never has time to take effect. Furthermore, the power law contraction along one\naxis could always be explained by a \"growing\" (non-diverging) function with negative coefficients,\ndue to the exponential term in the metric.\nThe impact of strong waves on the CMB, meanwhile, also requires deeper explanation. Preservation of the CMB's apparent anisotropy at first glance appears to require some \"tuning\", a\nparticular growing-decaying ratio which merits deeper questioning; there is also the outstanding\nmatter of why we happen to live in one of the few periods of time when the CMB appears nearly\nisotropic. Clever examination of the symmetries of Bianchi IX may reveal a more satisfying answer, although the ability of Bianchi IX to explain CMB anomalies is one of its most satisfying\nfeatures.\nMost fundamentally, the biggest impact of the Bianchi IX theory of cosmic acceleration is the\nexpansion of the cosmologist's parameter space. While in scalar models the only parameter truly\nopen for discussion is the function describing the equation of state of dark energy, the gravitational waves of the Bianchi IX universe have four degrees of freedom; while the strength a\nnon-zero cosmological constant has some theoretical justification in fundamental physics independent of large-scale cosmology, there is no immediately apparent reason why the gravitational\nwaves in Bianchi IX should have any particular amplitude. As always in cosmology, we need\nmore information than we have.\n\nAcknowledgments\nI thank Leonid Grishchuk and Peter Coles for continuing advice, support and supervision throughout this research.
