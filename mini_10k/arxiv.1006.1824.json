This process converts many of the laser photons\ninto a single high-frequency photon in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) or soft x-ray regime. The generation process can be understood in terms of the three-step model\n[2]. First, the electron tunnels out under the influence\nof the laser field, and then it propagates freely in the\nlaser field and can be driven back to the nucleus, where\nit can finally recombine. HHG has been used to generate coherent XUV radiation [3, 4]. Concerning HHG\nfrom molecules, there has been a lot of attention of the\ncommunity recently toward the relationship between the\nemitted radiation and molecular characteristics. One can\nfor instance determine the internuclear distance in the diatomic molecules H+\n2 , H2 and to a lesser extent CO2 and\nO2 from a destructive interference minimum in the harmonic spectrum [5\u20137] or reconstruct molecular orbitals\nfrom the emitted radiation [8, 9]. The correct explanation of the minimum in CO2 , however, appears to require\na multiorbital treatment [10]. Recent experiments on N2\nindicate multiorbital contributions as well [11]. Preparing molecules to control the harmonic emission is also\npossible: ring current states were used theoretically to\ngenerate circularly polarized high harmonics [12].\nIn the three-step model [2] or its quantum-mechanical\nformulation in terms of the strong-field approximation\n(SFA) [13], due to wave-packet spreading the on-axis continuum wave packet carries practically no signature of the\nground-state wave function at the moment of recombination. Therefore, the molecular characteristics imprinted\n\n\u2217\n\nezwan@itp.uni-hannover.de\n\non the emitted spectra must come from the recombination step (or from multiorbital interference). In the existing practical molecular imaging techniques the influence\nof the laser field on the recombination step and often also\nthe effect of the Coulomb potential on the propagation\nstep are ignored. To study the effects of these approximations, we perform a numerical comparison between\nthe harmonics emitted in a normal laser-induced HHG\nprocess and harmonics emitted when an artificially prepared wave packet collides with the molecular ion in the\nabsence of any laser pulse [5]. Additionally, we compare\nthe harmonics generated by both physical and artificial\nlaser pulses to disentangle the influence of the different\nharmonic trajectories. We show that elliptically polarized HHG radiation from linearly polarized generating\npulses occurs near the two-center interference. Elliptical\npolarization of harmonics from linearly polarized generating pulses was also found in recent experiments [14].\n\nII.\n\nMETHOD\n\nIn this article we solve the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation (TDSE) numerically in two dimensions for a\nmolecular ion with a single electron. We consider two dimensions because in 2D many of the 3D characteristics of\nHHG are already present, such as the existence of directions perpendicular and parallel to the laser polarization\naxis. On the other hand, the TDSE can be solved very\nquickly, allowing the TDSE to be solved for many alignment angles of the molecule in the laser field. The TDSE\nis solved using the split-operator method [15, 16], and\nthe ground-state wave function is found by imaginarytime propagation [17].\nAtomic units are used throughout this article unless\nindicated otherwise. We will focus on 2D H+\n2 with fixed\n\n\f2\nnuclei. The TDSE reads\n\u2202\u03c8(r, t)\n= \u0124\u03c8(r, t),\n(1a)\n\u2202t\np\u03022\n+ V (r) + r * E(t),\n(1b)\n\u0124 =\n2\n1\n1\nV (r) = \u2212 q\n\u2212q\n,\nR 2\nR\n(r \u2212 2 ) + a2\n(r + 2 )2 + a2\n(1c)\n\u0001\nwhere p\u0302 is the momentum operator, r = xy , V is a softcore potential, and E(t) is the time-dependent electric\nfield of the laser pulse. The internuclear axis R makes an\nangle \u03b8 with respect to the laser polarization axis x. Using the softcore parameter a2 = 0.5 and an internuclear\ndistance of R = 2, the ionization potential is Ip = 30.2\neV. The total harmonic emission spectrum including xand y-polarization is calculated from the numerical solution of the TDSE as\nZ\n2\nS(\u03c9) = |\u03b1(\u03c9)| , \u03b1(\u03c9) = W (t)h\u03b1(t)iei\u03c9t dt, (2a)\ni\n\nh\u03b1(t)i = h\u03c8(r, t)|\u2207V (r) + E(t)|\u03c8(r, t)i,\n\n(2b)\n\nwhere h\u03b1(t)i is the dipole acceleration and S(\u03c9) is proportional to the intensity of the emitted radiation at frequency \u03c9. Here W (t) is a standardly used temporal window that prevents high-frequency artifacts at the boundaries of the integration.\nFor H+\n2 , one observes a minimum in the spectrum of\nemitted radiation polarized in the x-direction because of\ninterference between the two centers of the molecule [5].\nUsing the plane-wave approximation for the returning\nelectron, the (first and usually only observable) minimum\noccurs when the x-projection of the internuclear distance\nas seen by the returning wave packet is equal to half the\nde Broglie wavelength. Therefore the minimum will shift\ntoward higher harmonics with higher angles between the\nlaser polarization and molecular axis. Since it is a structural minimum that depends only on the geometry of the\nbound state, one expects to see no shifts in the location\nof the minimum when different laser pulses are used or\nwhen instead Gaussian wave packets are used to generate\nharmonics in a laser-field-free electron-ion collision [5].\nFor the wave-packet simulation without laser field, the\ncenter of the potential is placed in the middle of the grid\nat (x, y) = (0, 0), and the Gaussian wave packet is introduced with its center at position (x0 = Lx /4, 0), with\nthe grid size denoted as Lx \u00d7 Ly . The initial wave packet\n\u03c8(r) is given by the superposition\n\u03c8(r) = \u03c80 (r) + \u03c8G (r),\nr\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u221a\ncx cy \u2212 21 c2x (x\u2212 L4x )2 +c2y y2 +ik0 x\n\u03c8G (r) = C\n,\ne\n\u03c0\n\n(3a)\n(3b)\n\nwhere \u03c80 (r) is the ground-state wave function, and cx ,\ncy quantify the momentum spread of the Gaussian wave\npacket in the x- and y-directions. The wave packet moves\n\nwith a central momentum k0 < 0 toward the molecular\ncore. The norm of the Gaussian wave packet C should be\nset small to mimic the situation of HHG at the typically\nused intensities. We use C = 10\u22126 . The momentumspread parameter in the y-direction is chosen as\ncy = rk |k0 |,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere a tuning parameter rk is used to study the effects of the different types of Gaussian wave packets\nand can be set to simulate the character of the continuum wave packet as generated by a laser pulse. The\nmomentum-spread parameter in the x-direction cx is set\nrelatively large to allow for many harmonics to be probed\nby one wave packet. The propagation time is chosen such\nthat a classical particle with momentum k0 moves from\n(Lx /4, 0) to (\u2212Lx /4, 0) during the propagation. As a result, the strongest emission is expected at the middle of\nthe propagation, such that little distortion is introduced\nwhen using a window function in the temporal Fourier\ntransform for obtaining the power spectrum. As an example, for rk = 0.01 and k0 = \u22121.78, the grid dimensions are Lx = 383 a.u. and Ly = 1006 a.u. Here we use\n2304 \u00d7 6144 spatial grid points and 2000 time steps. The\npropagation time equals the optical period of a laser field\nwith a 780-nm wavelength.\nFor the simulation of the laser-induced HHG process\nwe use a laser pulse linearly polarized in the x-direction.\nThe initial state is set to the ground state \u03c80 (r). The\ntime-dependent wave function is propagated for the laser\npulse duration and two additional cycles after the end of\nthe laser pulse to minimize distortions from the dipole\nacceleration window and to allow the wave packets to\nreturn to the nucleus. For the laser-induced calculations\nwe use a grid measuring 280 \u00d7 84 a.u. with 1536 \u00d7 512\ngrid points and 2000 time steps per optical cycle.\nIII.\n\nHARMONIC INTENSITY\n\nThe laser wavelength for the calculations of laserinduced HHG is 780 nm. For the Gaussian-wave-packet\ncollisions, the same energy scale in units of harmonics\nof a 780 nm laser pulse is used. In Fig. 1 we show the\nalignment dependence of the emitted radiation for harmonic 49 polarized along the x-direction. We compare a\nGaussian wave packet with k0 = \u22121.78 and rk = 0.01 to\nlaser pulses with an intensity of I = 5 \u00d7 1014 W/cm2 and\ndifferent lengths. The laser pulses have a sin2 envelope\nof either three or five cycles, or a trapezoidal envelope of\nfifteen cycles length with five-cycle ramps. The carrierenvelope phase, i.e., the phase between the carrier wave\nand the envelope, is \u03c04 for the shortest pulse and 0 for\nthe five-cycle sin2 -pulse. The trapezoidal pulse has a sinusoidal carrier wave. The intensity data are integrated\nover one harmonic order. The figure shows that the different laser pulses give rise to minima that are near, but\nnot exactly at, the same position as the minimum from\nthe Gaussian wave packet.\n\n\f3\n10\n\n55\n50\n45\n\u03b8min (degrees)\n\nIntensity (arb. units)\n\n1\n0.1\n0.01\n\n40\n35\n30\n25\n20\n\n0.001\n\n15\n20\n\n0.0001\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n30\n\n90\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nHarmonic order\n\n70\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\nHarmonic order\n\n\u03b8 (degrees)\n\nFIG. 1.

The\nlaser pulses produce minima that follow the same trend\nas the Gaussian wave packet, but are scattered around\nthe general trend. The results for short and longer pulses\nare scattered differently, but not less or more. The differences between relatively long ten- and fifteen-cycle pulses\npulses are small. This is expected, since both pulses\nare effectively almost cw-like. Even for the fifteen-cycle\npulse the depletion of the ground state remains below 6%.\nThe results suggest that when using the plane-wave approximation for the returning electron in molecular imaging applications, a dispersion relationship in between the\nLewenstein and Ip -corrected relationships should be used\n[18, 19].\n\nA.\n\nIn Fig. 2 we plot the positions of the minima \u03b8min in\nthe alignment dependence versus harmonic order for different laser pulses and the Gaussian wave packet from\nFig. 1. Also indicated in the figure are the curves that\nare predicted for the two-center minimum (R cos \u03b8min =\n\u03c0/k) [6]p\nusing either the energy-conserving relationship\nk(\u03c9) = 2(\u03c9 \u2212 Ip ) from the Lewenstein model [13], or\n\u221a\nusing the Ip -corrected relationship k(\u03c9) = 2\u03c9 that has\nbeen adopted previously for molecular imaging [5, 8].\nThe physical argument for the Ip -correction is that, when\ndescribing the returning electron as a plane wave, one\nshould take into account that at the moment of recombination its wave number is modified by the absorption of\nIp into the kinetic energy. From Fig. 2 it is clear that the\nGaussian wave packet gives rise to a very smooth shift\n\nEffect of the propagation step\n\nWe compare the positions of interference minima for\ndifferent types of Gaussian wave packets in Fig. 3. We\nvary the momentum spread of the wave packet in the perpendicular direction, the central momentum of the wave\npacket and the position at which the wave packet starts.\nThe striking and important observation is that all curves\nlie very close together. Apparently the position of the\nminimum is insensitive to the momentum distribution of\nthe continuum wave packet. Only for the lowest harmonics we can observe some difference between the different\nkinds of continuum wave packets. Small differences appear there between wave packets starting far away and\nthose starting close to the nucleus, due to the effect of the\nlong-range binding potential. Our findings suggest that\nin terms of the three-step model, the propagation step\n\n\f4\nhas little effect on the observed position of the minimum\nand cannot account for the big fluctuations observed in\nFig. 2.\n\nEffect of the recombination step\n\nIn the three-step model [2], the laser field during the recombination step and possible interferences between different parts of the continuum wave packet are ignored.\nIn reality, the electronic wave packet does not recombine\nunder laser-field-free conditions, and different trajectories recombine at different times with different phases.\nTo study the effect on the recombination process, we resort to a comparison of the minimum positions using artificial pulses. The pulses are four-cycle sinusoidal pulses\nwith a constant envelope corresponding to an intensity\nof I = 5 \u00d7 1014 W/cm2 , i.e., a section of a cw laser field.\nAt t = 0, the electric field is E(0) = 0. Optionally, we\nemploy either or both of two methods to influence the\nrecombination step: (i) setting the dipole acceleration to\n0 after some point in time during the propagation and\n(ii) turning off the laser field for the inner region near\nthe nuclei after some point in time.\nEvery half laser cycle, both a short and long classical\nelectronic trajectory contribute to every harmonic peak\n[13]. The distinction between short and long trajectories\nis based on whether the electron spends shorter or longer\nthan 0.65T in the continuum, where T is the laser period.\nSetting the dipole acceleration to 0 beyond t = T\u03b1 using\na temporal width \u2206T\u03b1 [10], Eq.

We use \u2206T\u03b1 = 0.1T . We set the dipole\nacceleration to 0 at either T\u03b1 = 0.95T , the return time\nof the most energetic trajectory, or at T\u03b1 = 1.182T , the\ntime at which the return momentum of the first halfcycle's long trajectory matches that of the second halfcycle's short trajectory. Thus with T\u03b1 = 0.95T we take\ninto account only the short trajectories from the first halfcycle, and T\u03b1 = 1.182T is the optimal point in time for\nselecting only a single pair of short and long trajectories.\nAdditionally, we optionally turn off the laser in the\ninner region at time t = Tl . To prevent artifacts, the field\nis turned off gradually in both space and time.\np The laser\ninteraction is completely turned off for r = x2 + y 2 <\n4, undisturbed for r > 6, and we use a sin2 -transition\nbetween these two extremes.

This\nmethod could be easily extended to filter out either the\nshort or long trajectories.\nIn Fig. 4 we compare the scattering around the\nGaussian-wave-packet results from the sinusoidal pulse\n(red plusses) with those from setting the dipole acceleration to 0 at T\u03b1 = 1.182T (green circles) and from setting the dipole acceleration to 0 at T\u03b1 = 0.95T (violet\npoints). With T\u03b1 = 1.182T the interference between the\nlong and short trajectories leads to a strong, but regular oscillation of the laser-induced results around the\nGaussian-wave-packet results. The same interference between the short and long trajectories can be seen in an\nassociated harmonic spectrum as the top, black solid line\nin Fig. 5. When every harmonic peak is caused by a single\ntrajectory (violet points in Fig. 4), the interference disappears completely and the result is almost as smooth as\nthat from the Gaussian wave packet. Under normal circumstances, additional later returns from the same trajectories contribute to the spectrum. For a finite pulse\nlength, different half-cycles also contribute differently because of the pulse envelope.

Additionally, we show the\ncase where there is only a single set of short and long\ntrajectories with additionally the laser pulse turned off\nin the inner region at Tl = 0.5T (violet points). The\nstrong reduction in scattering amplitude for the violet\npoints in Fig. 6 can be understood from Fig. 5, where we\nplot the harmonic spectra for molecular alignment angles 45\u25e6 and 50\u25e6 for the case of the green circles (violet\npoints) in Fig. 6 as the top (bottom) two curves. For\nthe unmodified laser pulse we observe a significant shift\nof the trajectory interference positions in the harmonic\nspectrum when going from alignment at 45\u25e6 to 50\u25e6 . Although at first sight the bottom two curves in Fig. 5 look\nmore distinct from one another, a closer look reveals that\nthe alignment dependence of the trajectory interference\nminima is actually a lot smaller with the laser field turned\noff in the inner region, as there is no shift visible. The\nstrong scattering at low harmonics for the violet points\nin Fig. 6 is caused by the fact that the finite temporal\nwidths of the filters R(t) and S(t) suppress the complete\nlower end of the spectrum.\n\n55\n50\n\nIV.\n\n\u03b8min (degrees)\n\n45\n\nHARMONIC PHASE\n\n40\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\nHarmonic order\n\nFIG. 6.

The interference between the short and long trajectories can probably also explain the scattering of the\ntwo-center minimum as a function of intensity as found\nby Gonoskov and Ryabikin [19].\nThe fact that the results for a single harmonic trajectory (violet points in Fig. 4) lie so close to the Gaussianwave-packet result, means that the laser field has no significant influence on the amplitude of the recombination\nmatrix elements. This supports using HHG for molecular imaging [5, 6, 8, 9], as in a typical experimental\nsetup only short trajectories contribute to the harmonic\nspectrum. Interestingly, however, in Fig. 6 we show that\nturning off the laser field during the recombination does\nhave a significant effect on the interference between the\nshort and long trajectories. In the figure, the green cir-\n\nThe two-center minimum in the harmonic spectrum is\naccompanied by a phase jump in the harmonic phase. Using the plane-wave approximation, this should be a sharp\n\u03c0-phase jump [6]. However, in experiments a smaller and\nsmoother phase jump is observed [20]. Such deviations\ncan be attributed to nonclassical momenta [21] and to effects of the Coulombic potential [22]. Similarly, a phase\njump is observable when one considers a fixed harmonic\nas a function of \u03b8. The phase of harmonic 49 for emission polarized along x is shown in Fig. 7. The same set\nof laser pulses and Gaussian wave packet is used as in\nFig. 1. The curves have been shifted such that for \u03b8 = 0\nthe phase is 0. The figure shows that both the Gaussian\nwave packet and the extremely short three-cycle laser\npulse give rise to a mostly constant phase as a function\nof \u03b8 with a phase jump slightly smaller than \u03c0 at the\nlocation of the minimum. The longer pulses have a more\nsmeared-out phase jump. In the neighborhood of the\nminimum their jump is a lot smaller than \u03c0 but over\nthe complete \u03b8-range the jump seems to be bigger than\n\u03c0. This behavior for the longer pulses is probably an effect of more, and longer, trajectories contributing to the\nharmonics. Different trajectories are associated with different Coulomb corrections and therefore the harmonic\nphase becomes smeared out. This is in accordance with\nthe shallower intensity minima in Fig. 1 for the longer\npulses.\nIt is interesting to investigate the phase jump for the\ndifferent Gaussian wave packets of Fig. 3. This is plotted\nin Fig. 8 for a smaller range of \u03b8 for clarity. The broad\nGaussian wave packet starting closing to the nucleus (red\ndashed line) starts out with small perpendicular momentum components.

Furthermore, ep is the unit vector in the main\npolarization direction, and eo is the unit vector in the\nperpendicular direction. The angle between the main\npolarization direction of the emitted radiation and the\npolarization axis of the laser pulse is \u03c6. Similarly to the\nangle \u03b8 between the molecular axis and the laser polarization axis, a counterclockwise rotation corresponds to\na positive angle. However, we limit the definition of \u03c6\nto the range [0, \u03c0), whereas the complex number c covers the full complex domain. At a given \u03c9, all possible\ntypes of coherent plane-wave radiation can be uniquely\ndescribed by the parameters (\u03c6, \u01eb, c).\nNumerically the acceleration of the dipole moment is\nidentified with the far-field harmonic field (up to an overall phase).

To some extent, the difference with the narrow\nGaussian wave packet (green dot-dashed line) is that\nthe latter experiences roughly the same Coulomb effects,\nbut starts out with much larger perpendicular momentum components. This leads to a much smoother phase\njump.

The direction of greatest emission corresponds to the main polarization direction, and\nthe emission in the orthogonal direction is a measure for\nthe ellipticity of the emitted radiation [14]. Only under\nconsiderable effort for the experimentalist, the harmonic\nphase can be measured interferometrically as a function\nof alignment angle [10, 23] or as a function of harmonic\norder [24]. Theoretically one has easy access to the harmonic phase. Using the phase information, Eq.

Numerically one will run into problems using\nthe above conversion if the emitted radiation is either linearly or circularly polarized. Therefore one should check\nbeforehand if one of these conditions applies and use appropriate simplified conversion equations instead.\n\nA.\n\nPolarization direction\n\nThe two-center interference minimum can also be observed in the polarization direction \u03c6 of the harmonics.\nBecause the emission in the direction parallel to the laser\npolarization direction is strongly suppressed at the minimum, we expect a \u03c02 -jump toward the minimum. The\n\u03c0-jump for the harmonic phase in the x-direction in Fig. 7\ntranslates to a full \u03c0-rotation for \u03c6. This is exactly what\nis observed for a Gaussian wave packet and harmonics\ngenerated by different laser pulses in Fig. 9. The polarization direction of the emitted radiation was averaged\nover one harmonic order using the total emitted intensities as weights.\nThe phase jump in the x-direction at the two-center interference minimum becomes smoother for low harmonics [20\u201322]. In the following we investigate how the jump\nin the polarization direction depends on harmonic order.\n\nand \u03b8 = 37\u25e6 , and it reaches a maximum of\n|\u03b1y |\n|\u03b1x | ,\n\n|\u03b1y |\n|\u03b1x |\n\n= 2 at\n\nthe main polarization\n\u03b8 = 25\u25e6 . For a given ratio\ndirection is aligned more along the laboratory-frame (x\nor y) direction with the higher amplitude if the phase difference \u03b4 between the laboratory-frame directions is far\nfrom 0 or \u03c0. We can observe this effect clearly in Fig. 10:\nat \u03b8 equal to 20\u25e6 \u201325\u25e6 for harmonic 31, where \u03b4 is around\n\u03c0\n2 and |\u03b1y | is bigger than |\u03b1x |, the relatively slow increase\nin the polarization direction shows the tendency that the\npolarization is clamped toward the y-direction (\u03c6 = \u03c02 ).\nWe fit the jump observed in Fig. 9 with a smoothened\nstep function to determine the location \u03b8p and the width\n\u2206\u03b8 of the polarization-direction jump. When one plots\nthe location \u03b8p as a function of harmonic order, one\nobtains a result very similar to that shown in Fig. 2.\nIn Fig. 11 we plot the width \u2206\u03b8 as a function of harmonic order for a Gaussian wave packet and different\nlaser pulses. Again, the results for the different laser\npulses are scattered around the Gaussian-wave-packet result. The width of the jump for \u03c6 as a function of harmonic order does not depend on the laser pulse length.\nOne observes that the width of the jump decreases with\nincreasing harmonic order. An important part of this decrease is due to a purely geometric effect: with increasing\nharmonic order, the minimum moves to higher \u03b8 leading\nto a narrower interference pattern as a function of \u03b8.\nIn the absence of Coulomb effects, i.e., when \u03b1x and \u03b1y\n\n\f8\n0.8\n\n20\n\n0.4\n\n15\n\nEllipticity \u01eb\n\nwidth of \u03c6-jump (degrees)\n\n0.6\n\n10\n\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n\n5\n\n-0.6\n0\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nHarmonic order\n\nFIG. 11.

We assume that\n\u03b1y is alignment independent over the range of the twocenter minimum, as also indicated by numerical tests that\nwe have performed, and that the alignment dependence\nof \u03b1x comes purely from the two-center interference with\n\u0001\n(0)\nthe phase lag kR cos \u03b8, i.e., \u03b1x = \u03b1x cos 12 kR cos \u03b8\n[22, 25]. Then the variation \u2206\u03c6 of the polarization direction on varying \u03b8 in the vicinity of \u03b8p is proportional to\n\u2206(kR cos \u03b8) \u2243 (\u03c0/ cos \u03b8p ) \u2206(cos \u03b8). Thus the width \u2206\u03b8\nshould be such that \u2206(cos \u03b8) / cos \u03b8p is independent of\n(0)\nharmonic frequency, provided that \u03b1y /\u03b1x is frequency\nindependent. The brown line in Fig. 11 is obtained for \u2206\u03b8\nif we set \u2206(cos \u03b8) / cos \u03b8p\u0001 arbitrarily equal\n\u0001 to 0.185 using\n\u2206\u03b8\n\u2212\ncos\n\u03b8\n+\n\u2206(cos \u03b8) \u2243 cos \u03b8p \u2212 \u2206\u03b8\np\n2\n2 . A comparison\nbetween the brown line and the other curves shows that\nat the high end of the spectrum the decrease in \u2206\u03b8 cannot be explained any more exclusively by the geometric\neffect. Since \u03b8p varies very slowly in this range, we expect\n(0)\nonly a slow variation in \u03b1y /\u03b1x . This suggests that decreasing Coulomb effects play a role, in accordance with\nFig. 2, where for harmonics 50\u201380 we observe a transition toward the curve predicted by the SFA dispersion\nrelationship, also indicating decreasing Coulomb effects\nin this range.\n\nB.\n\n-0.8\n\n80\n\nEllipticity\n\nIn Fig. 12 we plot the ellipticity \u01eb of the emitted radiation for harmonic 49 as a function of \u03b8. Again the\npolarization data was averaged over one harmonic order\nusing the intensities as weights. The plot shows that both\na Gaussian wave packet and different laser pulses give\nrise to both significant and varying elliptical emission.\nNonzero ellipticity means that the harmonics in the x\nand y-directions are emitted with different phases.

Since the ionization and propagation\nstep are identical for the two components of the radiation, the ellipticity must come from the recombination\nstep. Therefore, this result confirms that the Coulomb\neffects can lead to significant ellipticity. The ellipticity\nfor parallel or perpendicular alignment is zero, because\nat these alignment angles, the perpendicular component\nof the emitted radiation vanishes. The ellipticity goes\nthrough zero at some intermediate alignment angle. If\nwe plot the angle of zero ellipticity as a function of harmonic order, we arrive at Fig. 13. This plot shows that in\nthe close vicinity of the two-center interference minimum,\nthe ellipticity goes through zero. This is as expected, because at the location of the minimum, the x-component\nof the emitted radiation is very small. Because the xcomponent has opposite signs before and after the minimum, the ellipticity changes handedness through the\nminimum.\n\n\f9\n0.8\n0.6\n\nExtremum of \u01eb\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.6\n20\n\n30\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n40\n50\n60\nHarmonic order\n\n70\n\n80\n\nFIG. 14.

Around the interference minimum, the main\npolarization angle makes a \u03c0-jump and the ellipticity goes\nthrough zero. The Coulomb effects are less important at\nhigher harmonics. Therefore we observe decreasing overall ellipticity and a relatively sharp jump in the polarization direction at the high end of the spectrum.\n\n55\n\n\u03b8 at extremum of \u01eb (degrees)\n\nstructural minimum from the two-center interference between the two lobes of the orbital.

A laser-induced HHG\nspectrum shows the same behavior if only a single electronic trajectory contributes per harmonic, as is the case\nfor a typical experimental setup. This justifies using\nHHG for molecular imaging as the laser field has no significant effect on the amplitude of the recombination matrix element. When a single set of short and long electron\ntrajectories contributes to the spectrum, the interference\nbetween the two trajectories causes a large but regular\noscillation around the general trend. Introducing more\nand longer trajectories by using longer pulses has the\neffect of averaging out the oscillations to a smaller scattering around the Gaussian-wave-packet result and leads\nto a smoother interference minimum as a function of \u03b8.\n\n50\n45\n40\n35\n30\n25\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n60\nHarmonic order\n\n70\n\n80\n\nFIG. 15. (Color online) Alignment angles for extrema from\nFig. 14. Same wave packets and pulses as in Fig. 14.\n\nFor each harmonic, we can also plot the extrema of\nthe ellipticity that can be reached and the alignment angles at which those extrema are reached. The results are\nshown in Figs. 14 and 15, respectively. We observe that\nfor sufficiently high harmonic orders, the ellipticity extrema become smaller in absolute value and move closer\nto the two-center interference minimum with increasing\nharmonic order. Since the ellipticity is an indicator of\nnon-plane-wave character, the decreasing ellipticity is another signature of decreasing Coulomb effects for higher\nharmonic orders, which correspond to higher return momenta.\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWhen a Gaussian wave packet collides with an aligned\nH+\n2 -molecule, the resulting harmonic spectrum has a\n\nIn the wave-packet calculations, the Coulomb effects\ncould be investigated in more detail by changing the\nstrength of the potential for the evolution of the continuum part. This may be subject of future work. Finally,\nwe mention that for randomly oriented molecules, the\nperpendicular harmonic components and thereby also the\nellipticity vanish due to the cylindrical symmetry of the\nsystem around the laser polarization axis. The behavior\nof the phase is more complicated. Since, however, HHG is\ndominated in our case by the large orientation angles for\ngeometrical reasons, we do not expect a clear signature\nof the phase jump for randomly oriented molecules.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors thank the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft for funding the Centre for Quantum Engineering\nand Space-Time Research (QUEST).
