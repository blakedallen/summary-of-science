A triangulated category (T , \u03a3) is said to be Calabi-Yau of dimension d if \u03a3d is a Serre functor.\nWe determine which stable module categories of self-injective algebras \u039b of finite type are Calabi-Yau and\ncompute their Calabi-Yau dimensions, correcting errors in previous work. We first show that the Calabi-Yau\nproperty of mod-\u039b can be detected in the minimal projective resolution of the stable Auslander algebra \u0393\nof \u039b, over its enveloping algebra. We then describe the beginning of such a minimal resolution for any\nmesh algebra of a stable translation quiver and apply covering theory to relate these minimal resolutions\nto those of the (generalized) preprojective algebras of Dynkin graphs. For representation-finite self-injective\nalgebras of torsion order t = 1, we obtain a complete description of their stable Calabi-Yau properties, but\nonly partial results for those algebras of torsion order t = 2. We also obtain some new information about\nthe periods of the representation-finite self-injective algebras of torsion order t > 1. Finally, we describe\nhow these questions can also be approached by realizing the stable categories of representation-finite selfinjective algebras as orbit categories of the bounded derived categories of hereditary algebras, and illustrate\nthis technique with several explicit computations that our previous methods left unsettled.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe notion of the Calabi-Yau dimension of a triangulated category was originally introduced by Kontsevich\nas an abstraction of a key homological characterization of Calabi-Yau varieties. Recently, this concept has\nplayed an important role in the study of the cluster categories introduced by Buan, Marsh, Reineke, Reiten\nand Todorov [11] and their generalizations. In fact, Keller and Reiten [36] have illustrated that the Calabi-Yau\ndimension is one of several invariants that characterizes the cluster categories among triangulated categories.\nThe goal of this article is to calculate the Calabi-Yau dimensions of the stable module categories mod-\u039b\nfor standard self-injective algebras \u039b of finite representation type. Two previous papers [19, 8], by Erdmann and Skowro\u0144ski and by Bialkowski and Skowro\u0144ski, respectively, already address this question. The\ncommon strategy of these papers is to look at isomorphisms of functors on the universal cover of the category ind(mod-\u039b). However, it was soon recognized that [8] failed to establish the necessary functorial\nisomorphisms: only showing that certain syzygy functors had the same effect as the Nakayama functor on\nisomorphism classes of modules. A paper of Holm and J\u00f8rgensen [29] attempted to remedy this shortcoming,\nclaiming that such a pair of functors in a triangulated category of finite type had to be isomorphic. Their\napproach employs the covering theory of triangulated categories along the lines of [31, 1]. However, while\nstudying \u03a9-periodicity in stable categories of finite type in [17], we uncovered an error in some of the values of Calabi-Yau dimensions computed in [19, 30], leading to a counterexample to the main result of [29].\nNamely, over the representation-finite symmetric algebra of tree class D6 and frequency 1/3 (see Section 6\nfor terminology) we found \u03a93 M \u223c\n= M for every indecomposable nonprojective module M , while \u03a93 is not\nisomorphic to the identity functor (except in characteristic 2). Thus, the present article aims at extending\nthe approach used in [17] to identify the Calabi-Yau dimensions of the stable categories of all self-injective\nalgebras of finite type.\nWe begin in Section 2 with the definition of Calabi-Yau dimensions of triangulated categories, and show\nthat the Calabi-Yau property of mod-\u039b can be expressed in terms of the homology of the stable Auslander\nalgebra \u0393 of \u039b. In this way our primary task is reduced to finding the bimodule D\u0393 among the syzygies of\n\u0393 over its enveloping algebra \u0393e . Provided \u039b is standard, the stable Auslander algebra \u0393 coincides with the\nmesh algebra of the stable AR-quiver of \u039b, and hence we shift our focus to mesh algebras of stable translation\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification.

In Section 3, we compile some known information on these algebras and review the definitions of the\nm-fold mesh algebras from [20], which turn out to be precisely the finite-dimensional mesh algebras. Next,\nin Section 4 we give a general description of (the beginning of) the minimal projective resolution of such a\nmesh algebra over its enveloping algebra, generalizing resolutions computed for (generalized) preprojective\nalgebras in [21, 6].\nUnfortunately, for specific algebras the precise structure of the relevant syzygies in these resolutions is still\ndifficult to compute directly. Hence, we approach this problem \"from the ground up\": that is, by carrying\nout these computations for \"minimal\" mesh algebras (for instance, the preprojective algebras) and lifting\nthem to Galois covers. Section 5 describes the lifting procedure developed in [17], which relates the graded\nprojective resolution of a group-graded algebra A to the projective resolution of the Galois covering B that\ncorresponds to the given grading of A. In particular, we consider the (A, A)-bimodule DA and the Nakayama\nautomorphism and make more explicit some of the claims in Section 6 of [10].\nWith all our tools in place, we then proceed in Section 6 to analyze certain graded versions of the minimal\nresolutions of preprojective algebras in order to compute the stable CY-dimensions of representation-finite\nself-injective algebras of torsion order t = 1. Here, we obtain the following result, which includes corrected\nvalues for the stable CY-dimensions of self-injective algebras of tree-class D2n , E7 or E8 . (See Section 6 for\nnotation and terminology.)\nTheorem 6.1. Suppose \u039b is a standard self-injective algebra of type (\u2206, f, 1). Then mod-\u039b is d-Calabi-Yau\nfor some d > 0 if and only if (h\u2217\u2206 , f m\u2206 ) = 1. The minimal such d is given as follows.\n(1) If \u2206 = A1 , D2n , E7 or E8 and either 2|f or char(k) = 2, then d \u2261 1 \u2212 (h\u2217\u2206 )\u22121 (mod f m\u2206 ) and\n0 < d \u2264 f m\u2206 .\n(2) In all remaining cases d = 1 + 2r where r \u2261 \u2212(h\u2206 )\u22121 (mod f m\u2206 ) and 0 \u2264 r < f m\u2206 .\nIn particular, this result demonstrates that the Calabi-Yau dimension of a (standard, algebraic) triangulated\nk-category of finite type is not necessarily determined by the k-linear structure (i.e., the AR-quiver) of the\ncategory. Rather, we see that the characteristic of the base field k plays a role as well. This should not really\ncome as a surprise given the important role given to \u22121 by the axioms for triangulated categories.\nSection 7 is devoted to the torsion order 2 case, requiring analysis of the graded resolutions of generalized\npreprojective algebras. However, infinitely many \"minimal\" mesh algebras would need to be considered, and\nthus our method yields only partial results in this case (see Propositions 7.2, 7.3, 7.4). The single family\nof representation-finite self-injective algebras of torsion order t = 3 are then addressed in Section 8. While\nthese algebras are never stably Calabi-Yau, we calculate their periods by computing the minimal resolution\nof the generalized preprojective algebra associated to the Dynkin graph G2 .\nFinally, for the sake of completeness, we conclude with a description of an alternative path to many of\nthe same results in Section 9. This approach \u2013 key details of which were provided by Bernhard Keller \u2013\nincorporates Asashiba's formalism [4] to successfully modify the original strategy pursued in [8, 29] via the\ncovering theory of triangulated categories. Not only does this method make clear what was missing from the\noriginal arguments, but it also provides a simple and direct way to calculate the Calabi-Yau dimensions and\nperiods of most (standard, algebraic) triangulated categories of finite type. We apply it in several examples\nto resolve some of the ambiguities left in our original approach; nevertheless, there remain a handful of\ninstances where we are still unable to pinpoint the Calabi-Yau dimension or period of a stable category\nmod-\u039b of finite type.\nI would like to thank Bernhard Keller for answering my questions and kindly permitting me to include\nhis ideas in Section 9, as well as Peter J\u00f8rgensen and Thorsten Holm for the stimulating email discussions\nthat greatly helped my understanding of the approach described there. I am also indebted to the referee for\nsuggesting the diagram in the proof of Theorem 9.5.\n2. Calabi-Yau dimensions of stable categories\nLet k be a field and suppose that T is a k-linear triangulated category with suspension \u03a3 such that\ndimk T (x, y) < \u221e for all objects x and y in T . A triangulated autoequivalence [S, \u03b7] : T \u2192 T with\n\u223c\n=\n\u03b7 : S\u03a3 \u2192 \u03a3S is said to be a Serre functor, or a Serre duality, if there are natural isomorphisms\n(2.1)\n\n\u223c\n=\n\ntx,y : T (y, Sx) \u2212\u2192 DT (x, y)\n2\n\n\ffor all x, y \u2208 T , where D = Homk (\u2212, k). More precisely, a Serre functor should also be compatible with the\nsuspension \u03a3 of T in the following sense [34, 9]:\n(2.2)\n\ntx,y \u03a3\u22121 (\u03b7x )\u2217 = \u2212D\u03a3t\u03a3x,\u03a3y ,\n\nwhere (\u03b7x )\u2217 is shorthand for the map T (\u03a3y, \u03b7x ). If T admits an autoequivalence S satisfying (2.1), then\n(2.2) can be used to make S into a (triangulated) Serre functor in a unique way (see the appendix of [9]).\nBy definition, T is Calabi-Yau of CY-dimension d if it has a Serre duality S and there is an isomorphism of\ntriangulated functors [S, \u03b7] \u223c\n= [\u03a3, \u22121\u03a32 ]d \u223c\n= [\u03a3d , (\u22121)d 1\u03a3d+1 ] for some integer d. Such a d is not necessarily\nunique, and we thus adopt the convention that the CY-dimension of a Calabi-Yau triangulated category is\nthe smallest positive integer d such that S \u223c\n= \u03a3d as triangulated functors.\nIn practice, natural isomorphisms as in (2.1) appear in various places. However, checking the compatibility\ncondition (2.2) is a more difficult task, perhaps requiring deeper techniques. Thus, in the present article, we\nfocus solely on the weak Calabi-Yau dimension of T , which is defined to be the smallest positive integer d\nsuch that \u03a3d \u223c\n= S as additive functors. Alternatively, it is the smallest positive integer d for which we have\nnatural isomorphisms T (y, \u03a3d x) \u223c\n= DT (x, y) for all x, y \u2208 T . Likewise, by a Serre functor we usually mean\na triangulated autoequivalence satisfying (2.1), but not necessarily (2.2). In fact, this usage of Serre functor\nand of 'CY-dimension' in place of 'weak CY-dimension' appears quite common in the literature predating\n[33]. In particular, the weak Calabi-Yau property is often sufficient for applications (see, eg. [33]).\nNow suppose that A is a finite-dimensional self-injective k-algebra and consider T = mod-A, which is a\ntriangulated category with the co-syzygy functor \u03a9\u22121 as its suspension [25]. We define the stable Calabi-Yau\ndimension of A to be the (weak) CY-dimension of mod-A when this category is Calabi-Yau, and we define\nit to be infinite otherwise. It follows from the Auslander-Reiten formula DHomA (X, Y ) \u223c\n= Ext1A (Y, DTrX)\n2\n\u223c\nand the isomorphism DTr = \u03a9 \u03bd that S := \u03a9\u03bd is a Serre functor for mod-A, where \u03bd = \u2212 \u2297A DA is the\nNakayama functor. Hence, we see that mod-A has Calabi-Yau dimension d if and only if\n(2.3)\n\n\u03a9\u2212(d+1)\n\n\u223c\n= \u03bd\n\nas triangulated functors on mod-A. As noted above, however, we will focus on checking when (2.3) is an\n\u2212(d+1)\n(A), such\nisomorphism of (non-triangulated) functors. Since \u03a9\u2212(d+1) is induced by the functor \u2212 \u2297A \u03a9Ae\n\u2212(d+1)\n(A) \u223c\nan isomorphism would follow from an isomorphism of bimodules \u03a9Ae\n= DA. We remark that an\nisomorphism of the latter variety is the basis for the definition of a Calabi-Yau Frobenius algebra in [22],\n\u2212(d+1)\nalthough it is not clear in general whether the minimal positive integer d such that \u03a9Ae\n(A) \u223c\n= DA\ncoincides with the stable CY-dimension of A.\nWe henceforth assume that k is algebraically closed and that the algebras we consider are basic. We may\nthus suppose that our algebras are presented as path algebras of quivers modulo relations. Corresponding\nto such a coordinatization A = kQ/I for a quiver Q, we write e1 , . . . , en for the primitive idempotents\nassociated to the vertices Q0 of Q, and we write Q1 for the set of arrows of Q. We denote the simple right\nA-modules (up to isomorphism) as Si for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. As we typically work with right modules, we compose\npaths in kQ from left to right, so that we may take Q to be the bound quiver of A.\nThroughout this article, we will reserve \u039b for a standard self-injective k-algebra of finite representation\ntype. We let M\u039b be the direct sum of the indecomposable nonprojective \u039b-modules (one representative from\neach isomorphism class), and let \u0393 = End(M\u039b ) be the stable Auslander algebra of \u039b. Since \u039b is standard, \u0393\nis isomorphic to the mesh algebra of the stable Auslander-Reiten quiver of \u039b. We wish to relate the stable\nCalabi-Yau properties of \u039b and \u0393, but for later applications we work in slightly greater generality.\nAssume that C is an exact Krull-Schmidt Frobenius k-category with enough projective-injectives (for\ninstance, C could be mod-\u039b or the category of Cohen-Macaulay modules over a Gorenstein hypersurface\nsingularity). Then the stable category C is triangulated, with suspension functor \u03a9\u22121 . If C has finite\nrepresentation type, we can form its stable Auslander algebra \u0393 = EndC (M ) where M is a representation\ngenerator for C (without projective summands). It is easy to see that mod-\u0393 is again a Frobenius category; in\nparticular, if C is Hom-finite then \u0393 is a finite-dimensional self-injective k-algebra. The following proposition\nrelates the stable Calabi-Yau property of C to that of mod-\u0393.\n3\n\n\fProposition 2.1. Assume that C, as above, is Hom-finite and has a Serre functor S. Then, for a positive\ninteger d, C is d-Calabi-Yau if and only if there is an isomorphism of (\u0393, \u0393)-bimodules\n\u223c\n\u03a9\u22123d\ne (\u0393) = D\u0393.\n\u0393\n\nIn this case the stable CY-dimension of \u0393 is bounded above by 3d \u2212 1.\nProof. Following Sections 6 and 7 of [12], we have an isomorphism L := HomC (M, \u03a9\u22121 M ) \u223c\n= \u03a9\u22123\n\u0393e (\u0393) of\n\u22123i\n1\n\u2212i\n\u2297i \u223c\n(\u0393, \u0393)-bimodules , which induces further bimodule isomorphisms L = HomC (M, \u03a9 M ) \u223c\n= \u03a9\u0393e (\u0393) for all\n\u223c\n=\ni \u2265 1. We note that the left \u0393-module structure on \u03a9\u2212i M is induced by an isomorphism M \u2212\u2192 \u03a9\u2212i M ,\nwhich exists since \u03a9 is an equivalence on C, and different choices of such an isomorphism produce isomorphic\nbimodules for L.\nSince S is a Serre functor on C, we obtain an isomorphism\nHom (M, SM ) \u223c\n= DHom (M, M ) = D\u0393,\nC\n\nC\n\nwhich is an isomorphism of (\u0393, \u0393)-bimodules by the naturality condition in the definition of a Serre functor.\nClearly, a functorial isomorphism \u03a9\u2212d \u223c\n= SM in C that respects\n= S on C induces an isomorphism \u03a9\u2212d M \u223c\nthe left action of \u0393, and hence we get isomorphisms D\u0393 \u223c\n= HomC (M, \u03a9\u2212d M ) \u223c\n= \u03a9\u22123d\n\u0393e (\u0393) of bimodules over\n\u0393.\nConversely, a bimodule isomorphism D\u0393 \u223c\n= \u03a9\u22123d\n\u0393e (\u0393) induces an isomorphism\nHomC (M, SM ) \u223c\n= HomC (M, \u03a9\u2212d M )\nof (\u0393, \u0393)-bimodules. Equivalently, we have an isomorphism of functors HomC (\u2212, SM ) \u223c\n= HomC (\u2212, \u03a9\u2212d M )\n\u2212d\n\u223c\nfrom C to mod-\u0393. By Yoneda's lemma, it follows that SM = \u03a9 M as left \u0393-modules, and this amounts to\nan isomorphism of functors S \u223c\n= \u03a9\u2212d on C. \u0003\nThe above result is key to our treatment of the standard self-injective algebras of finite representation\ntype. However, in characteristic 2, there is one family of nonstandard representation-finite self-injective\nalgebras of type (D3m , 1/3, 1) where m \u2265 2. These algebras are in fact symmetric and periodic [17], and\nhence stably Calabi-Yau. Their stable Calabi-Yau dimensions are bounded above by their periods minus 1,\nand we know that the period p of the nonstandard algebra of type (D3m , 1/3, 1) satisfies 2m\u22121 | p | 4(2m\u22121)\n[17].\n3. Mesh algebras and covering theory\nHaving reduced the problem of computing CY-dimensions of representation-finite self-injective algebras\nto one of understanding the syzygies of the corresponding stable Auslander algebras, we now turn toward\nthe class of mesh algebras. In the present article, a stable translation quiver (\u0393, \u03c4 ) will mean a locally finite\nquiver \u0393 = (\u03930 , \u03931 ), possibly with loops and multiple arrows, together with a bijection \u03c4 : \u03930 \u2192 \u03930 such\nthat for each pair of vertices x, y \u2208 \u03930 , the number of arrows in \u03931 from from x to y equals the number of\narrows from \u03c4 (y) to x. For each pair of vertices x, y \u2208 \u03930 , we choose a bijection \u03c3 : \u03931 (x, y) \u2192 \u03931 (\u03c4 (y), x),\nand we call \u03c3 a polarization of (\u0393, \u03c4 ). As \u03c3 2 induces a bijection between the set of arrows from x to y and\nthe set of arrows from \u03c4 (x) to \u03c4 (y), we extend \u03c4 to a graph automorphism of \u0393 by setting \u03c4 (\u03b1) = \u03c3 2 (\u03b1) for\nall \u03b1 \u2208 \u03931 . We denote the initial and terminal vertices of an arrow \u03b1 \u2208 \u03931 by i\u03b1 and t\u03b1 respectively.\nGiven a stable translation quiver (\u0393, \u03c4 ), we define the mesh algebra k(\u0393) over k (or over any commutative\nground ring), to be the path algebra modulo relations k\u0393/I, where the ideal I is generated by the mesh\nrelations\n(\n)\nX\n.\n\u03c3(\u03b1)\u03b1\nt\u03b1=i\n\ni\u2208\u03930\n\n1Actually, for the isomorphism to hold in this generality, we need to modify Buchweitz's argument in his proof of Theorem\n1.5 (cf. 7.1 in [12]) in order to avoid the hypothesis that the Auslander algebra \u039b has Hochschild dimension 2. Without this\n\u223c\nhypothesis, one still obtains an epimorphism of (\u0393, \u0393)-bimodules \u03a93\u0393e (\u0393)\u2295(proj.) \u2192 Tor\u039b\n2 (\u0393, \u0393) = L. Since [12] shows that these\nbimodules induce isomorphic functors on mod-\u0393, the kernel of this epimorphism must be a projective bimodule by Theorem\n3.1 of [5], assuming k is perfect. Since \u0393 is self-injective, the epimorphism splits and L \u223c\n= \u03a93\u0393e (\u0393). We refer the reader to the\nproof of Theorem 3.2 in [18] for additional details.\n4\n\n\fNote that if \u0393 is infinite, the mesh algebra k(\u0393) is a ring without 1 but with enough local idempotents. We\nmay also speak about the mesh category of (\u0393, \u03c4 ), which we also denote k(\u0393). It is just the k-linearization of\nthe path category of \u0393, modulo the ideal I generated by the mesh relations; i.e., its object set is \u03930 and its\nmorphism sets k(\u0393)(x, y) are quotients of the free k-modules generated by all paths in \u0393 from x to y by their\nsubmodules generated by the mesh relations. A translation quiver automorphism of \u0393 naturally induces an\nalgebra automorphism of k(\u0393), which we will denote by the same symbol. For example, any mesh algebra\nhas an automorphism \u03c4 , corresponding to the action of \u03c4 on its quiver.\nAnother common definition of a translation quiver takes \u0393 to be a valued quiver without multiple arrows\nsuch that the valuation of the arrow \u03c3(\u03b1) is (b, a) whenever the valuation of \u03b1 is (a, b). Our definition may\nbe viewed as a special case of this one by viewing n parallel arrows as a single arrow with valuation (n, n).\nWe have chosen the present definition instead in order to have \u0393 coincide with the bound quiver of the mesh\nalgebra.\nExamples. (1) Given a tree \u2206, we recall the definition of the stable translation quiver Z\u2206. We first choose\nan orientation of \u2206, making it into a directed graph (the particular choice does not matter, as two different\norientations lead to isomorphic translation quivers). The vertex set of Z\u2206 is \u22060 \u00d7 Z and there are edges\n(\u03b1,n)\n\n(\u03b1\u2032 ,n)\n\n\u03b1\n\n(x, n) \u2212\u2192 (y, n) and (y, n \u2212 1) \u2212\u2192 (x, n) for each arrow x \u2212\u2192 y of \u2206. We set \u03c4 (x, n) = (x, n \u2212 1) for all\n(x, n) \u2208 \u22060 \u00d7 Z and define \u03c3(\u03b1, n) = (\u03b1\u2032 , n) and \u03c3(\u03b1\u2032 , n) = (\u03b1, n \u2212 1) for all \u03b1 \u2208 \u22061 and n \u2208 Z.\n(2) Any tree \u2206 can be made into a stable translation quiver by replacing each edge \u03b1 of \u2206 with two arrows\n\u03b11 and \u03b12 in opposite directions. We then set \u03c4 (x) = x for all x \u2208 \u22060 and have \u03c3 swap the two arrows\n\u03b11 and \u03b12 corresponding to each edge \u03b1 of \u2206. The corresponding mesh algebra is then the preprojective\nalgebra P (\u2206). It is finite-dimensional if and only if \u2206 is a (simply laced) Dynkin graph.\n(3) An analogue of the preprojective algebra can also be associated to each of the non-simply laced Dynkin\ngraphs Bn , Cn , F4 and G2 , as well as to the generalized Dynkin graphs Ln . The stable translation quivers are\nshown in Table 3.1 with the nontrivial actions of \u03c4 illustrated by dotted lines. Whereas work of Auslander\nand Reiten shows that the (finite-dimensional) preprojective algebras arise as the stable Auslander algebras\nof the categories of maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules over simple hypersurface singularities of dimension\nd = 2, Dieterich and Wiedemann have shown that many of these generalized preprojective algebras are realized by the stable Auslander algebras of simple hypersurface singularities of dimension 1 [16] (see also [41]).\nFor our purposes, the most general examples of interest are the m-fold mesh algebras defined in [20]. The\ncorresponding stable translation quivers are obtained from the Z\u2206 with \u2206 Dynkin, by factoring out a weakly\nadmissible group G of automorphisms (i.e., for all g \u2208 G \u2212 {1} and all x \u2208 (Z\u2206)0 , we have x+ \u2229 (gx)+ = \u2205)\n[15]. Such a group G is always infinite cyclic and the possible generators are classified in [1, 40] for \u2206 Dynkin.\nWe now list the resulting stable translation quivers for the m-fold mesh algebras (m \u2265 1):\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2206(m) = Z\u2206/h\u03c4 m i, for \u2206 = An , Dn , En .\n(m)\nBn = ZA2n\u22121 /h\u03c1\u03c4 m i, where \u03c1 = \u03c1A2n\u22121 is reflection in the central horizontal line of ZA2n\u22121 .\n(m)\nCn = ZDn+1 /h\u03c1\u03c4 m i, where \u03c1 = \u03c1Dn+1 is induced by the order 2 automorphism of Dn+1 .\n(m)\nF4 = ZE6 /h\u03c1\u03c4 m i, where \u03c1 = \u03c1E6 is induced by the order 2 automorphism of E6 .\n(m)\nG2 = ZD4 /h\u03c1\u03c4 m i, where \u03c1 is induced by a fixed order 3 automorphism of D4 .\n(m)\nLn = ZA2n /h\u03c1\u03c4 m i, where \u03c1 = \u03c1A2n is the automorphism given by reflecting ZA2n in the central\nhorizontal line and then shifting half a unit to the right. Notice \u03c12 = \u03c4 \u22121 .\n\nIt is well known that the corresponding mesh algebras are finite-dimensional and self-injective. In fact it is\nshown in [10] that they are periodic. It turns out that these are all of the stable translation quivers with\nfinite-dimensional mesh algebras. While we posit that this has been observed elsewhere, we include a brief\nproof below based on classical arguments as in [27, 28].\nFinally, observe that since the mesh relations always have the same form, whenever G is a weakly admissible group of automorphisms of a stable translation quiver \u0393, the mesh algebra k(\u0393) will be a Galois cover of\nthe mesh algebra k(\u0393/G) with group G. Furthermore, if H \u22b3 G are weakly admissible automorphism groups\n5\n\n\fQ Bn :\n\nQ Cn :\n\n0O ^===\n====\n====\n===\u001e\n@ 2o\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u000f \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n1\n/\n\n*** o\n\n/ *** o\n\n3o\n\no\n2nB \u2212\n3\n2n \u2212\nO 885\n\u0006 O\n88\n\u0006\n88 \u0006\u0006\u0006\n88 \u0006\u0006\n\u0006\u000688\n\u0006\u0006 888\n\u0006\n88\n\u0006\u0006\n8\u001c \u000f\n\u000f \u0006\u0006\no\n2n \u2212 2\n2n \u2212 4\n\n/ n\u22121 o\n\n/n\n\n4\n@ 2O .o\n..\n\u0010G O\n\u0010\n.. \u0010\u0010\n.. \u0010\u0010\n/\n\u0010.\n0 ^>>>\n\u0010\u0010\u0010 ...\n>>>>\n>>>> \u0010\u0010 ..\n>>>\u001e \u0010\n.\u0017 \u000f\n\u000f\u0010\n5\n3o\n\nQF4 :\n\n1o\n\nQG2 :\n\n@ 2O\nw\n1o\n\nQ Ln :\n\n*** o\n\no\no\nG 3O\n\u0001\u0001@ 1O ..\n\u0010\n\u0001\n\u0001 \u0001 .. \u0010\u0010\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n.. \u0010\u0010\n\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\n.\u0010.\u0010\n0 ^===\n\u0010\u0010\u0010 ...\n====\n==== \u0010\u0010 ..\n===\u001e \u0010\n.\u0017 \u000f\n\u000f\u0010\no\n2\n4o\n\n$\n\n/\n\n0o\n\n0 ^>>>\n>>>>\n>>>>\n>>>\u001e\n'\n/\n\n1o\n\n3\n/\n\n/ *** o\n\n2o\n\n/\n\nn\u22122 o\n\n/\n\nn\u22121\n\nTable 3.1. The quivers of the generalized preprojective algebras.\n\nof \u0393, then G/H is naturally a weakly admissible automorphism group of \u0393/H and k(\u0393/H) is a Galois cover\nof k(\u0393/G) with group G/H.\nWe conclude this section by showing that the m-fold mesh algebras are precisely the finite-dimensional\nmesh algebras of stable translation quivers. A very similar result is proved in Theorem 4.0.4 of [1], and that\nproof could be adapted to our setting, but we have chosen to include a slightly more direct argument.\nTheorem 3.1. Suppose that (\u0393, \u03c4, \u03c3) is a (finite) stable translation quiver (possibly with loops or multiple\narrows) such that the mesh algebra k(\u0393) is finite-dimensional over k. Then k(\u0393) is an m-fold mesh algebra.\nProof. Assume A := k(\u0393) is finite-dimensional, and for all i, j \u2208 \u03930 let \u0393ij\n1 be the number of arrows in \u0393 from\ni to j. We first use \u0393 to construct a generalized Cartan matrix C (in the sense of [28]) and a corresponding\nvalued graph \u2206. Let \u22060 be a set of representatives of the \u03c4 -orbits in \u03930 , and for each i \u2208 \u22060 , set\n\u00ae\nP\n\u2212 l\u2208h\u03c4 ij \u0393il\n1 , i 6= j\nP\nCij =\n2 \u2212 l\u2208h\u03c4 ii \u0393il\n1, i = j\n\nThen C = {Cij }i,j\u2208\u22060 is a generalized Cartan matrix: i.e.,\n6\n\n\f\u2022 Cii \u2264 2 for all i \u2208 \u22060 ;\n\u2022 Cij \u2264 0 for all i, j \u2208 \u22060 ;\n\u2022 Cij 6= 0 if and only if Cji 6= 0, for all i, j \u2208 \u22060 .\nThe first two conditions are obvious, and the third follows since if \u03b1 is an arrow from i to \u03c4 r (j), then\n\u03c3 \u22121 \u03c4 \u2212r (\u03b1) is an arrow from j to \u03c4 \u2212r\u22121 (i). (The corresponding valued graph \u2206 is then obtained by including\nan edge from i to j whenever Cij 6= 0, and weighting this edge by (|Cij |, |Cji |).)\nNext, we check that setting di = dimk (ei A) for i \u2208 \u22060 defines a subadditive function that is not additive\non C. To see this we will need an observation about the minimal projective resolution of a simple A-module:\nif Si is the simple A-module corresponding to i \u2208 \u03930 , then the minimal projective resolution of Si begins\nM\net\u03b1 A \u2212\u2192 ei A \u2212\u2192 Si \u2192 0.\ne\u03c4 \u22121 i A \u2212\u2192\n\u03b1\u2208\u03931 ,i\u03b1=i\n\nThis follows from the description of the beginning of the minimal resolution of A over Ae given in the next\nsection, which holds for an arbitrary mesh algebra. Now from this exact sequence, noting that di = d\u03c4 \u22121 (i) ,\nwe obtain the inequality\nX\n2di \u2212\ndt\u03b1 \u2265 1.\ni\u03b1=i\n\nNow consider for any i \u2208 \u22060 ,\nX\n\ndj Cij\n\n=\n\nX\n\ndi (2 \u2212\n\nj\u2208\u22060\n\n\u0393il\n1)\u2212\n\nj\u2208\u22060 \u2212{i}\n\nl\u2208h\u03c4 ii\n\n=\n\n2di \u2212\n\nX\n\ndj\n\nj\u2208\u22060\n\n=\n\n2di \u2212\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\n\u0393il\n1\n\ndj\n\nX\n\n\u0393il\n1\n\nl\u2208h\u03c4 ij\n\nl\u2208h\u03c4 ij\n\ndj \u0393ij\n1\n\nj\u2208\u03930\n\n\u2265\n\n1.\n\nHence, by [28], C is generalized Dynkin; i.e., \u2206 is one of the familiar graphs An , Bn , Cn , Dn , E6 , E7 , E8 , F4 , G2\nor else Ln . We define \u2206\u2032 by\n\uf8f1\n\u2206, if \u2206 = An , Dn , E6 , E7 , E8\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nA\n\uf8f4\n2n\u22121 , if \u2206 = Bn\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nA2n , if \u2206 = Ln\n\u2206\u2032 =\nD\n\uf8f4\nn+1 , if \u2206 = Cn\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nE6 , if \u2206 = F4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nD4 if \u2206 = G2 .\n\nWe now show that we can find \u2206\u2032 as a sectional tree in \u0393, and use it to construct a covering morphism Z\u2206\u2032 \u2212\u2192\n\u0393 as in 1.6 of [40]. It will then follow that \u0393 is a quotient of Z\u2206\u2032 by a weakly admissible automorphism\ngroup.\nThe vertices \u22060 of \u2206 correspond to the \u03c4 -orbits of vertices in \u0393, while the edges correspond to \u03c4 -orbits of\narrows between \u03c4 -orbits of vertices. If \u2206 is simply laced, then one easily obtains a sectional tree \u2206 in \u0393 by\nchoosing a representative of the \u03c4 -orbit corresponding to one vertex of \u2206 and then choosing representatives\nof the \u03c4 -orbits of arrows incident to this vertex, etc. We illustrate the process in the non-simply laced case\nwith the example of \u2206 = F4 . Here, there are 4 \u03c4 -orbits in \u03930 , say [1], [2], [3], [4] corresponding to the vertices\nof F4 .\n[1]\n\n[2]\n\n(1,2)\n\n[3]\n\n[4]\n\nStart by choosing a vertex x \u2208 [1] \u2282 \u03930 . The edge from [1] to [2] implies that there is an arrow from x\nto a vertex y \u2208 [2], and then the weighted edge from [2] to [3] implies that there are arrows from y to two\ndifferent vertices z1 , z2 \u2208 [3]. That z1 6= z2 follows from the fact that the label is (1, 2), meaning that z1 can\nonly have 1 arrow back to the orbit [2]. Finally, the edge from [3] to [4] implies that there are arrows from\n7\n\n\fboth z1 and z2 to vertices w1 , w2 \u2208 [4], and as above w1 6= w2 .\nw1 o\n\ny\n\nz1 o\n\n/ z2\n\n/ w2\n\n\u000f\nx\nAlso notice that, by construction, this subtree of \u0393 contains no paths of the form \u03c3(\u03b1)\u03b1, that is, it forms a\nsectional E6 -subtree. One proceeds similarly in the other cases. \u0003\n\n4. The Minimal Resolution of a Mesh Algebra\nIn this section we seek to generalize the description of the minimal projective bimodule resolutions for\nthe preprojective algebras of (generalized) Dynkin graphs [21, 10, 6]. We let (Q, \u03c4, \u03c3) be a stable translation\nquiver, where \u03c4 is the translation, and \u03c3 is the polarization. We continue the conventions outlined in the\nprevious section. We shall write A for the mesh algebra k(Q, \u03c4, \u03c3) of the translation quiver:\nPIn terms of quiver\nand relations A = kQ/I where I is the mesh ideal, which is generated by the relations { t(\u03b1)=j \u03c3(\u03b1)\u03b1 | j \u2208\nQ0 }. Furthermore, we assume that A is finite-dimensional and self-injective (actually, self-injectivity follows\nfrom finite-dimensionality by Theorem 3.1 for instance). In particular, we can fix a bilinear form (\u2212, \u2212) on\nA corresponding to an isomorphism A \u223c\n= DA.\nWe will show that the beginning of the minimal projective resolution of A over its enveloping algebra\nAe = Aop \u2297k A has the form\n(4.1)\n\n\u03b4\n\nR\n\n0 \u2192 L \u2212\u2192 P2 \u2212\u2192 P1 \u2212\u2192 P0 \u2212\u2192 A \u2192 0\n\nwhere L is a twisted bimodule 1 A\u03bc with \u03bc \u2208 Aut(A), P0 = \u2295i\u2208Q0 (ei \u2297 ei )Ae , P1 = \u2295\u03b1\u2208Q1 (ei\u03b1 \u2297 et\u03b1 )Ae and\nP2 = \u2295i\u2208Q0 (e\u03c4 i \u2297 ei )Ae ; and where\n(4.2)\n\n\u03b4(ei\u03b1 \u2297 et\u03b1 ) = x\u03b1\n\n:=\n\n(4.3)\n\nR(e\u03c4 i \u2297 ei ) = \u03c3i\n\n:=\n\n\u03b1 \u2297 et\u03b1 \u2212 ei\u03b1 \u2297 \u03b1, for \u03b1 \u2208 Q1\nX\n(\u03c3(\u03b1) \u2297 et\u03b1 + e\u03c4 i \u2297 \u03b1), for i \u2208 Q0 .\nt\u03b1=i\n\nMinimality and exactness of the first two terms of the resolution follow from [26]. Next, we check that\n\u03b4R = 0:\nX\n\u03b4R(e\u03c4 i \u2297 ei ) =\n(\u03c3(\u03b1)\u03b4(ei\u03b1 \u2297 et\u03b1 ) + \u03b4(ei\u03c3\u03b1 \u2297 et\u03c3\u03b1 )\u03b1)\nt\u03b1=i\n\n=\n\nX\n\n(\u03c3(\u03b1)\u03b1 \u2297 et\u03b1 \u2212 \u03c3(\u03b1) \u2297 \u03b1 + \u03c3(\u03b1) \u2297 \u03b1 \u2212 ei\u03c3\u03b1 \u2297 \u03c3(\u03b1)\u03b1)\n\nt\u03b1=i\n\n= 0.\n\nWe now show that im(R) = ker(\u03b4). Observe that none of the \u03c3i belong to the radical of ker(\u03b4). We also\nknow from the generators of the mesh ideal I that we have a projective cover \u03c0 : P2 \u2192 ker(\u03b4). Thus R = \u03c0h\nfor some endomorphism h of P2 , and the images of the generators of P2 under h cannot lie in the radical\nof P2 . Furthermore, since these generators are normed by different primitive idempotents ei (on the right,\nsay), their images under h will be linearly independent modulo the radical of P2 . In other words, h is an\nisomorphism, and we can identify \u03c0 with R.\nUsing the fact that A must be an m-fold mesh algebra, it follows from [6, 7] that L = \u03a93Ae (A) is a twisted\nbimodule of the form 1 A\u03bc for some \u03bc \u2208 Autk (A). The rest of this section is devoted to a more detailed\ndescription of L, parallel to work in [21], which can be applied to calculate the automorphism \u03bc in particular\ncases.\nWe begin by describing a set of generators of L. We first fix a basis B for A, consisting of homogeneous\nelements (with respect to the path-length grading of A) such that B = \u222ai,j\u2208Q0 ei Bej . Using the bilinear form\n(\u2212, \u2212) on A, we can define a dual basis B \u2217 so that (bi , b\u2217j ) = \u03b4i,j for all bi , bj \u2208 B. Notice that b \u2208 ei Bej\nif and only if b\u2217 \u2208 ej B \u2217 e\u03c0(i) , where \u03c0 is the Nakayama permutation of A (written as a permutation of the\n8\n\n\findices i). Letting |x| denote the degree of x \u2208 B with respect to the path length grading of A, we can now\ndefine\nX\n(4.4)\n\u03bei :=\n(\u22121)|x| \u03c4 (x) \u2297 x\u2217 \u2208 P2\nx\u2208ei B\n\nfor each i \u2208 Q0 .\nLemma 4.1. For each i \u2208 Q0 , we have R(\u03bei ) = 0.\nProof. We have\nR(\u03bei ) =\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)|x| \u03c4 (x)R(e\u03c4 (tx) \u2297 etx )x\u2217\n\nx\u2208ei B\n\n=\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)|x|\n\n\u03c4 (x)(\u03c3(\u03b1) \u2297 etx + e\u03c4 (tx) \u2297 \u03b1)x\u2217\n\nt\u03b1=tx\n\nx\u2208ei B\n\n=\n\nX\n\nX X\n\n\uf8ee\n\n(\u22121)d\u22121 \uf8f0\n\n\u03b1\u2208Q1 d\u22651\n\nX\n\n\u03c4 (x)\u03c3(\u03b1) \u2297 x\u2217 \u2212\n\nX\n\nx\u2208ei Be\u03c4 \u22121 (i\u03b1) ,|x|=d\n\nx\u2208ei Bet\u03b1 ,|x|=d\u22121\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\u03c4 (x) \u2297 \u03c3 \u22121 (\u03b1)x\u2217 \uf8fb .\n\nNow we wish to show that each of the summands in the last sum vanishes. Thus, we fix ei , d and \u03b1, and\nimitating [21], we write\nei Bd\u22121 et\u03b1 = {y1 , . . . , yr } and ei Bd e\u03c4 \u22121 (i\u03b1) = {x1 , . . . , xs }.\nThe summand enclosed in brackets above thus becomes\nr\ns\nX\nX\n\u03c4 (yi )\u03c3(\u03b1) \u2297 yi\u2217 \u2212\n\u03c4 (xj ) \u2297 \u03c3 \u22121 (\u03b1)x\u2217j .\n(4.5)\ni=1\n\nObserve that \u03c4 (yi )\u03c3(\u03b1) = \u03c4 (yi \u03c3\n\n\u22121\n\nj=1\n\n(\u03b1)) and\nyi \u03c3 \u22121 (\u03b1)\n\n(4.6)\n\n=\n\ns\nX\n\n(yi \u03c3 \u22121 (\u03b1), x\u2217j )xj\n\nj=1\n\n=\n\n(4.7)\n\ns\nX\n\n(yi , \u03c3 \u22121 (\u03b1)x\u2217j )xj .\n\nj=1\n\nP\nP\nP\nP\nHence ri=1 \u03c4 (yi )\u03c3(\u03b1) \u2297 yi\u2217 = ri=1 sj=1 (yi , \u03c3 \u22121 (\u03b1)x\u2217j )\u03c4 (xj ) \u2297 yi\u2217 , and similarly sj=1 \u03c4 (xj ) \u2297 \u03c3 \u22121 (\u03b1)x\u2217j =\nPs Pr\n\u22121\n(\u03b1)x\u2217j )yi\u2217 . Thus, we obtain the aforementioned cancellation. \u0003\nj=1\ni=1 \u03c4 (xj ) \u2297 (yi , \u03c3\nLemma 4.2. For each i \u2208 Q0 we have isomorphisms\n\u03bei A \u223c\n= e\u03c0i A,\nThus, letting \u03be =\n\nP\n\ni\u2208Q0 \u03bei ,\n\nand\n\nA\u03bei \u223c\n= Ae\u03c4 i .\n\nwe get \u03beA = \u2295i\u2208Q0 \u03bei A \u223c\n= A A.\n= AA and A\u03be = \u2295i\u2208Q0 A\u03bei \u223c\n\nProof. By construction we have \u03bei = e\u03c4 i \u03bei e\u03c0i . Thus the natural map e\u03c0i A \u2192 \u03bei A given by a 7\u2192 \u03bei a is onto.\nTo see that it is injective, it suffices to show that e\u2217\u03c0i is not sent to 0, since this element generates the socle\nof e\u03c0i A. The image of e\u2217\u03c0i is\n\u2217\n\n\u03bei e\u2217\u03c0i = (\u22121)|ei | \u03c4 (e\u2217i ) \u2297 e\u2217\u03c0i 6= 0\nsince e\u2217\u03c0i is annihilated by the radical of A on either side. The proof of the isomorphism A\u03bei \u223c\n= Ae\u03c4 i is\nsimilar. \u0003\nCorollary 4.3. L = ker(R) is generated by \u03be, and is isomorphic to a twisted bimodule 1 A\u03bc for some k-algebra\nautomorphism \u03bc of A. Moreover \u03bc(ei ) = e\u03c0\u03c4 \u22121 (i) for each i \u2208 Q0 .\n9\n\n\fProof. Since we already know L is a twisted bimodule, the above lemma shows that \u03be is a generator. To\ndescribe \u03bc, we use the left module isomorphism A L \u2192 A A induced by \u03be 7\u2192 1 to transport the bimodule\nstructure of L to A, obtaining 1 A\u03bc by definition of \u03bc. This yields the identity a\u03be = \u03be\u03bc(a) for any a \u2208 A.\nNow letting a = ei , the equality \u03bei = e\u03c4 i \u03bei e\u03c0i easily leads to \u03bc(ei ) = e\u03c0\u03c4 \u22121 (i) . \u0003\n\n5. Lifting the Nakayama functor\nAs shown above, deciding whether a representation-finite self-injective algebra \u039b is stably Calabi-Yau\namounts to determining if some co-syzygy of its stable Auslander algebra \u0393 is isomorphic to the bimodule\nD\u0393. Since \u0393 is a mesh algebra of Dynkin type, we can use the theory of Galois covers and smash products\nto relate it to a preprojective algebra of a (simply laced) Dynkin graph. In this section, we review the\nnecessary results on covering theory, and apply them to show that whenever an algebra B is a finite Galois\ncover of A, the bimodule lifting functor of [17] takes DA to DB. We also discuss how to lift the Nakayama\nautomorphism from A to B in this case.\nIn order to analyze Galois coverings of an algebra A with finite Galois group G, we will study the\ncorresponding G-grading of A and the smash product algebra A#k[G]\u2217 as in [13, 14]. In this setting,\nthe grading of A arises from a function \u03c0 : Q1 \u2192 G as in [23], whose image generates G. In particular,\ndeg(ei ) = e (the identity of G) for all i, and the Jacobson radical JA is a homogeneous ideal containing\n\u2295g6=e Ag . Furthermore we assume that A is indecomposable and the grading is such that B is indecomposable\nas well. We write modG -A for the category of finite-dimensional G-graded right A-modules and degreepreserving morphisms. We also write BimodG -A (respectively, Bimod-A) for the category of G-graded\n(respectively, all) (A, A)-bimodules. For a graded A-module M and d \u2208 G, we define M [d] to be the graded\nA-module given by M [d]g = Md\u22121 g for all g \u2208 G.\nThe smash product B = A#k[G]\u2217 is the free A-module \u2295g\u2208G Apg with multiplication apg *bph = abgh\u22121 ph ,\nwhere bg denotes the degree-g component of an element b \u2208 A. It is easy to see that the elements {ei pg | 1 \u2264\ni \u2264 n, g \u2208 G} form a complete set of pairwise orthogonal primitive idempotents for B. It is also well known\nthat there is an isomorphism of categories modG -A \u223c\n= mod-B.\nIn [17], we defined a functor F = Fe : BimodG -A \u2192 Bimod-B by setting F (M ) = M \u2297A B as an\n(A, B)-bimodule, and extending the left action of A to B by the rule\n\u00df\namk ph , if g = kh\napg * mk ph =\n0,\notherwise\nP\nfor a \u2208 A, g \u2208 G, m = k\u2208G mk \u2208 M with mk \u2208 Mk and k, h \u2208 G. It is shown in [17] that F is exact and\ntakes projectives to projectives. Furthermore, F (M [d]) \u223c\n= 1 F (M )d , whenever d \u2208 Z(G). We wish to study\nthe effect of this functor on the bimodule DA. Notice that DA = Homk (A, k) has a natural G-grading given\nby (DA)g = Homk (Ag\u22121 , k) for each g \u2208 G. Henceforth, we assume DA is given this grading.\nProposition 5.1. There is a (B, B)-bimodule isomorphism F (DA) \u223c\n= DB.\nProof. We define \u03c6 : DA \u2297A B \u2192 DB by\n\u03c6(f pg )(aph ) = f (agh\u22121 )\nfor all f \u2208 DA, a \u2208 A and g, h \u2208 G. We first check that \u03c6 is a right B-module homomorphism. For\na, b \u2208 A, f \u2208 DA and g, h, l \u2208 G, we have\n\u03c6(f pg * bpl )(aph ) =\n=\n=\n\n\u03c6(f bgl\u22121 pl )(aph )\nf bgl\u22121 (alh\u22121 )\nf (bgl\u22121 alh\u22121 )\n\nand\n(\u03c6(f pg ) * bpl )(aph )\n\n= \u03c6(f pg )(balh\u22121 ph )\n= f (bgl\u22121 alh\u22121 ).\n10\n\n\fTo see that \u03c6 is a right B-module homomorphism, let fk \u2208 (DA)k for some k \u2208 G and consider\n\u00df\n\u03c6(bfk pl )(aph ), if g = kl\n\u03c6(bpg * fk pl )(aph ) =\n0,\nif g 6= kl\n\u00df\nfk (alh\u22121 b), if g = kl\n=\n0,\nif g 6= kl\n\u00df\nfk (abhg\u22121 ), if g = kl\n=\n0,\nif g 6= kl\n= \u03c6(fk pl )(aph bpg )\n= (bpg * \u03c6(fk pl ))(aph ).\nTo show that \u03c6 is an isomorphism clearly it suffices\nto show that it is injective, since both modules have\nP\nthe same k-dimension. Thus suppose that \u03c6( h\u2208G f h ph ) = 0 for certain f h \u2208 DA, which are not all\ng\n0. PThere exists a g \u2208 G\nP and a homogeneous element a = al \u2208 A such that f (al ) 6= 0, and then\n\u03c6( h\u2208G f h ph )(apl\u22121 g ) = h\u2208G f h (ahg\u22121 l ) = f g (al ) 6= 0, a contradiction. \u0003\n\nIf A is self-injective, the bimodule DA is isomorphic to a twisted bimodule \u03bd A1 where \u03bd \u2208 Aut(A) is\ncalled a Nakayama automorphism of A. In general, \u03bd represents a unique element in the group of outer\nk-algebra automorphisms of A. We write \u03c0 for the Nakayama permutation of A, which is the permutation\nof the isomorphism classes of primitive idempotents of A that is induced by \u03bd. As a consequence of the\nabove proposition, we recover the well-known fact that finite Galois covers of self-injective algebras are again\nself-injective: for, as right B-modules DBB \u223c\n= BB . Furthermore, if \u03bd is a graded\n= A \u2297 A BB \u223c\n= DA \u2297A BB \u223c\nautomorphism of A, we can describe the Nakayama automorphism of B. In this case, the twisted bimodule\n\u03bd A1 is graded with the same grading as A, but may not be isomorphic to DA as a graded bimodule.\nLemma 5.2. Suppose a Nakayama automorphism \u03bd of A is graded, i.e., \u03bd(Ag ) = Ag for all g \u2208 G. Then\nB has Nakayama automorphism \u03bd\u0303 defined by\n\u03bd\u0303(apg ) = \u03bd(a)pgx\nfor some x \u2208 G. Furthermore, if G is abelian, then x is the unique element of G such that DA[x] \u223c\n= \u03bd A1 as\ngraded bimodules.\nProof. Since DA \u223c\n= \u03bd A1 as ungraded bimodules and F (DA) \u223c\n= DB is indecomposable, Lemma 3.5 in [17]\nshows that DB \u223c\n= x F (\u03bd A1 ) for some x \u2208 G. As a right module, x F (\u03bd A1 ) \u223c\n= A \u2297A B \u223c\n= BB via the identity\nmap bph 7\u2192 bph , and hence we can obtain \u03bd\u0303 by examining the left-action of B on this bimodule. For a, b \u2208 A\nand g, h, k \u2208 G, we have\n\u00df\n\u03bd(a)bk ph if gx = kh\napg * (bk ph ) = apgx * bk ph =\n0\notherwise.\nOne easily checks that this agrees with the left action of B on \u03bd\u0303 B1 with \u03bd\u0303 as in the statement of the\nlemma. If G is abelian, then there exists a unique x such that DA[x] \u223c\n= \u03bd A1 as graded bimodules, since\nin this case graded bimodules can be identified with graded modules over the enveloping algebra Ae . Thus\nDB \u223c\n= x F (\u03bd A1 ), showing that this x agrees with the one used above. \u0003\n= F (\u03bd A1 [x\u22121 ]) \u223c\n= F (DA) \u223c\nThe algebra A is said to be symmetric if its Nakayama automorphism \u03bd is the identity. In this case,\nthe lemma shows that the Nakayama automorphism \u03bd\u0303 for B is the automorphism apg 7\u2192 apgx induced\nby some x \u2208 G. Although the converse does not hold in general, the following observations concerning\nNakayama permutations shall suffice for our purposes. Notice that \u03bd\u0303(ei pg ) = \u03bd(ei )pgx \u223c\n= \u03c0(ei )pgx , and thus\nthe Nakayama permutation \u03c0\u0303 for B is given by \u03c0\u0303(ei pg ) = \u03c0(ei )pgx . In particular, we see that the Nakayama\npermutation for B is induced by some automorphism x \u2208 G if and only if \u03c0 is the identity, i.e., if and only\nif A is weakly symmetric.\n6. Preprojective algebras and the torsion order 1 case\nWe now apply our results on mesh algebras to study the standard self-injective algebras of finite representation type. We recall that if \u039b is a standard self-injective algebra of finite type with stable AR-quiver\n11\n\n\f(\u0393, \u03c4 ), the full subcategory ind(mod-\u039b) of indecomposable objects in the stable category mod-\u039b is equivalent to the mesh category k(\u0393), and the stable Auslander algebra of \u039b is isomorphic to the mesh algebra\nk(\u0393). Furthermore, Asashiba has shown that all stably equivalent standard self-injective algebras of finite\nrepresentation type are in fact derived equivalent [2]. It then follows from [39] that the stable AR-quiver of\n\u039b determines the stable category mod-\u039b as a triangulated k-category and hence also determines the stable\nCY-dimension of \u039b.\nAs for the possible translation quivers that can arise as the AR-quiver of \u039b, Riedtmann's classification tells\nus that they have the form Z\u2206/\u03a0 for a simply laced Dynkin graph \u2206 and admissible group of automorphisms\n\u03a0 of the translation quiver Z\u2206 [40]. Moreover, \u03a0 is infinite-cyclic, generated by \u03b6\u03c4 \u2212r , where \u03c4 is the\ntranslation and \u03b6 is an automorphism of finite order t. Setting f = r/m\u2206 , the triple (\u2206, f, t) is then known\nas the type of \u039b, and \u2206, f, t are the tree-class, frequency and torsion order of \u039b, respectively. Here, m\u2206\nequals n, (2n \u2212 3), 11, 17 or 29 when \u2206 is An , Dn , E6 , E7 or E8 respectively, and the Coxeter number of \u2206 is\nh\u2206 = m\u2206 + 1. The possible types were classified by Riedtmann, and we refer the reader to the appendix\nof [3] for a list, along with presentations of representative algebras of each type in terms of quivers and\nrelations. Notice that since the type of \u039b completely specifies the AR-quiver of \u039b, we will be able to describe\nthe stable CY-dimension of \u039b solely in terms of these data. To simplify the statement of our main result,\nwe define\n\u00df\nh\u2206 ,\n\u2206 = An , D2n+1 , E6 , (n \u2265 2)\n(6.1)\nh\u2217\u2206 =\nh\u2206 /2, \u2206 = A1 , D2n , E7 , E8 ; (n \u2265 2)\nNote that this differs from the definition in [8] when \u2206 = A4l+1 with l \u2265 1.\nTheorem 6.1. Suppose \u039b is a standard self-injective algebra of type (\u2206, f, 1). Then mod-\u039b is d-Calabi-Yau\nfor some d > 0 if and only if (h\u2217\u2206 , f m\u2206 ) = 1. The minimal such d is given as follows.\n(1) If \u2206 = A1 , D2n , E7 or E8 and either 2|f or char(k) = 2, then d \u2261 1 \u2212 (h\u2217\u2206 )\u22121 (mod f m\u2206 ) and\n0 < d \u2264 f m\u2206 .\n(2) In all remaining cases d = 1 + 2r where r \u2261 \u2212(h\u2206 )\u22121 (mod f m\u2206 ) and 0 \u2264 r < f m\u2206 .\nTo prove this we will first apply the results of the previous section to study how the stable Calabi-Yau\nproperty for preprojective algebras lifts to mesh algebras, and to the stable Auslander algebra \u0393 in particular.\nWe recall from Example (2) in Section 3, that the preprojective algebra of a (simply laced) Dynkin graph\n\u2206 is the mesh algebra on the quiver Q\u2206 obtained from \u2206 by replacing each edge with a pair of arrows with\nopposite orientations. In fact, this translation quiver can be expressed as Z\u2206/h\u03c4 i, and hence we can realize\nsome of the m-fold mesh algebras as Galois covers of the preprojective algebras as outlined in Section 3.\nIn order to obtain information about these mesh algebras, we must consider the following \"half\"-grading\nof P (\u2206) as in [17]. We first choose a bipartite orientation of \u2206, so that each vertex is either a sink or source.\nWe give the corresponding arrows in Q\u2206 degree 0, and all remaining arrows degree 1, and consider this as a\nZ/hmi-grading for some positive integer m. Notice that we have deg(\u03b1) + deg(\u1fb1) = 1 for all arrows \u03b1 of Q\u2206 ,\nand deg(\u03b1\u03b2) = 1 for all arrows \u03b1, \u03b2 of Q\u2206 for which \u03b1\u03b2 6= 0 in P (\u2206). We shall call a vertex v a 0-source\n(resp. 0-sink) if all arrows leaving (resp. entering) v have degree 0, and the notions of 1-source and 1-sink\nare defined analogously.\nThe Nakayama permutation \u03c0 of A = P (\u2206) is induced by the unique graph automorphism of \u2206 of order\n2 when \u2206 = An (n \u2265 2), D2n+1 (n \u2265 2) or E6 , and is the identity otherwise (cf. Prop. 2.1 in [6]). We will\nalso write \u03c0 for the corresponding quiver automorphism of Q\u2206 . The following description of the Nakayama\nautomorphism \u03bd of P (\u2206) is taken from Definition 4.6 of [10].\n(6.2)\n\n\u03bd(ei ) = \u03c0(ei ) (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n);\n\n\u03bd(\u03b1) = (\u22121)deg(\u03b1) \u03c0(\u03b1) for all arrows \u03b1 in Q\u2206 .\n\nIn particular, observe that \u03bd is a graded automorphism if and only if \u2206 is not A2n for some n.\nWe now set A = P (\u2206) and consider the minimal projective resolution P\u2022 of A over Ae , as described in (4.14.3). It is not hard to see that the modules in this resolution can be graded appropriately so that it becomes a\ngraded projective resolution (cf. Section 2 of [17]). Furthermore, it is well known that \u03a93Ae (A) \u223c\n= DA \u223c\n= \u03bd A1\n6\n\u223c\n\u223c\n2\n(see, for example, [10]), and it then follows that \u03a9Ae (A) = \u03bd A1 = A. In the following proposition, we refine\nthese to isomorphisms of graded bimodules, by studying the grading of P\u2022 . (The reader may wish to contrast\nthese results with those in [10, 22], which are with respect to the natural path-length grading.)\n12\n\n\fProposition 6.2. Suppose A = P (\u2206) is given a half-grading as above. Then we have the following isomorphisms of graded bimodules.\n(1) \u03a93Ae (A) \u223c\n= DA[h\u2206 \u2212 1].\n(2) \u03a96Ae (A) \u223c\n= A[h\u2206 ].\n(3) For any \u2206 other than A2n for n \u2208 N, DA[h\u2206 /2 \u2212 1] \u223c\n= \u03bd A1 .\nProof. We will make repeated use of the fact that all indecomposable projective P (\u2206)-modules have Loewy\nlength h\u2206 \u2212 1 (See, e.g., [6, 10]).\n(3) Assume \u2206 is not A2n . Since soc(A) is generated by pahts of length h\u2206 \u2212 2, it will be concentrated in\ndegree \u2308 h\u22062\u22122 \u2309 = h2\u2206 \u2212 1. Thus DA is generated in degree 1 \u2212 h2\u2206 , and we must shift it by h2\u2206 \u2212 1 to have it\ngenerated in degree 0 as is \u03bd A1 . (If \u2206 = A2n , then soc(A) is generated by paths of odd length 2n \u2212 1, which\nmay have degree either n or n \u2212 1. Thus DA is generated in degrees \u2212n and 1 \u2212 n in this case.)\n(1) Since \u03a93Ae (A) \u223c\n= DA as a bimodule and it is indecomposable, it must be isomorphic to some shift of\nDA as a graded bimodule. (We are using the fact that when G is abelian, G-graded bimodules correspond\nto G-graded modules over the enveloping algebra with the grading Aeg = \u2295s\u2208G Ag\u2212s \u2297k As .) We thus need to\ndetermine in which degree(s) \u03a93Ae (A) is generated. Clearly, P0 is generated in degree 0, and P1 is generated in\ndegrees 0 and 1 since deg(x\u03b1 ) = deg(\u03b1) for any arrow \u03b1. We now claim that P1 is generated in degree 1. The\ngenerator ei \u2297 ei of P2 is mapped by R to \u03c3i \u2208 P1 , which is a sum of terms of the forms \u1fb1 \u2297 ei \u2208 (ei\u03b1 \u2297 ei )Ae\nand ei \u2297 \u03b1 \u2208 (ei \u2297 ei\u03b1 )Ae for the different arrows \u03b1 that end in i. In either P\ncase, we see that the term has\ndegree deg(\u1fb1) + deg(\u03b1) = 1. Now \u03a93Ae (A) is generated by the elements \u03bei = x\u2208ei B x \u2297 x\u2217 \u2208 P2 . Since xx\u2217 ,\nby definition, is in the socle of ei A, it has degree h2\u2206 \u2212 1 (when \u2206 6= A2n ), or else degree h\u22062\u00b11 \u2212 1 (when\n\u2206 = A2n ). Thus the term x \u2297 x\u2217 \u2208 P2 has degree h2\u2206 or h\u22062\u00b11 . Comparing these degrees to those in which\nDA is generated, yields \u03a93Ae (A) \u223c\n= DA[h\u2206 \u2212 1].\n(2) If \u2206 6= A2n , then \u03a93Ae (A) is a twisted bimodule generated in degree h\u2206 /2. Thus \u03a96Ae is generated in\ndegree h\u2206 and hence \u03a96Ae (A) \u223c\n= A[h\u2206 ]. Now, if \u2206 = A2n , we tensor P\u2022 with a simple right A-module Si to\nget the start of a minimal projective resolution\nM\nei\u03b1 A \u2212\u2192 ei A \u2192 Si \u2192 0,\n0 \u2192 \u03bd(Si ) \u2212\u2192 ei A \u2212\u2192\nt\u03b1=i\n\nwhere \u03bd is the Nakayama functor. Since P2 is generated in degree 1, \u03bd(Si ) is concentrated in degree one\ngreater than the degree of the socle of ei A, so that\n\u00df\n1 + \u2308 h\u22062\u22122 \u2309,\ni = 1-sink\n\u03a93 (Si ) = \u03bd(Si )[d], where d =\n1 + \u230a h\u22062\u22122 \u230b, i = 1-source.\n\nSince \u03bd interchanges the 1-sinks and 1-sources for P (A2n ), we have \u03a96 (Si ) generated in degree 1 + \u2308 h\u22062\u22122 \u2309 +\n1 + \u230a h\u22062\u22122 \u230b = h\u2206 . That \u03a96Ae (A) is generated in degree h\u2206 now follows from the observations in Section 2 of\n[17]. \u0003\nWe continue to let A = P (\u2206) be a preprojective algebra with a Z/hmi-grading as above, so that B =\nA#k[G]\u2217 is isomorphic to the mesh algebra of the translation quiver Z\u2206/h\u03c4 m i. It follows from the lemma\n\u22126\n\u223c\n\u223c\nthat \u03a9\u22123\nAe (A) = DA[\u22121] and \u03a9Ae (A) = A[\u2212h\u2206 ]. Hence, we have isomorphisms of graded bimodules\n\u223c\n= A[\u2212dh\u2206 ]\n\n\u03a9\u22126d\nAe (A)\n\n(6.3)\nand\n\n\u03a9\u22123\u22126d\n(A)\nAe\n\n(6.4)\n\n\u223c\n=\n\nDA[\u22121 \u2212 dh\u2206 ]\n\nfor all d \u2265 0. Lifting these isomorphisms to B via the functor F of the previous section, we obtain two\npossible cases:\n\u223c\n\u03a9\u22126d\nif and only if DB \u223c\n(6.5)\n= 1 B\u03c4 \u2212dh\u2206 \u223c\n= \u03c4 dh\u2206 B1 ;\nB e (B) = DB\n\u22123\u22126d\n\u223c DB if and only if dh\u2206 \u2261 \u22121 (mod m).\n\u03a9 e\n(B) =\n(6.6)\nB\n\nBy the remarks at the end of the previous section, we see that (6.5) can only occur if A is weakly symmetric,\nwhich happens if and only if \u2206 = A1 , D2n , E7 or E8 .\n13\n\n\fTheorem 6.3. Let B be the mesh algebra of the translation quiver Z\u2206/h\u03c4 m i, where \u2206 is a Dynkin graph.\n\u2217\n\u223c\nThen there exists a d > 0 such that \u03a9\u22123d\nB e (B) = DB as bimodules if and only if (m, h\u2206 ) = 1. The minimal\nsuch d is given as follows\n(1) If \u2206 = A1 , D2n , E7 or E8 and either 2|m or char(k) = 2, then d \u2261 1 \u2212 (h\u2217\u2206 )\u22121 (mod m) and\n0 < d \u2264 m.\n(2) In all remaining cases d = 1 + 2r where r \u2261 \u2212(h\u2206 )\u22121 (mod m) and 0 \u2264 r < m.\nProof. We first consider the case where P (\u2206) is not weakly symmetric. As noted above, this occurs for\n\u22123(1+2r)\n\u2206 = An , D2n+1 , E6 and n \u2265 2. Thus, we see from (6.6) above that \u03a9B e\n(B) \u223c\n= DB if and only if\n\u22121\n\u2217\nr \u2261 \u2212h\u2206 (mod m). The latter is possible if and only if (m, h\u2206 ) = 1, and this yields the desired value of d.\nFor the remaining \u2206, we break our proof into three cases based on the parity of m and the characteristic\nof k. First, assume that char(k) 6= 2. We want to examine when (6.5) occurs; i.e., we need to determine\nwhen the action of rh\u2206 \u2208 Z/hmi induces a Nakayama automorphism of B. Recall that the Nakayama\nautomorphism \u03bd\u0303 for B is given by \u03bd\u0303(apg ) = \u03bd(a)pg+h\u2206 /2\u22121 , according to Lemmas 4.2 and 5.2, with \u03bd as\nin (6.2). It is not hard to see that \u03bd\u0303 differs from the automorphism induced by h\u2206 /2 \u2212 P\n1 \u2208 Z/hmi by an\ninner automorphism if and only if m is even: the inner automorphism is conjugation by i\u2208Z/hmi (\u22121)i pi .\nFurthermore, when m is odd, the nontrivial outer automorphism (h\u2206 /2 \u2212 1)\u03bd \u22121 fixes all ei pg and is hence\nnot induced by any element of Z/hmi. Hence, we see that (1) is equivalent to\n(6.7)\n\nrh\u2206\n\n\u2261\n\n(h\u2206 /2 \u2212 1) (mod m)\n\nwhere m is even, and this yields d = 2r. Under our current assumptions, h\u2206 , h\u2206 /2 \u2212 1 and m are all even,\nso this is equivalent to rh\u2217\u2206 = (h\u2217\u2206 \u2212 1)/2 + sm/2 for some s \u2208 Z. Since h\u2217\u2206 and (h\u2217\u2206 \u2212 1)/2 are relatively\nprime, we can solve for r if and only if (h\u2217\u2206 , m/2) = 1, which holds if and only if (h\u2217\u2206 , m) = 1 since h\u2217\u2206 is\nodd. Letting d = 2r in the displayed congruence now leads to d \u2261 (h\u2217\u2206 )\u22121 (h\u2217\u2206 \u2212 1) \u2261 1 \u2212 (h\u2217\u2206 )\u22121 (mod m).\nWe continue to assume that char(k) 6= 2, and consider case (6.6). As above, this requires that (m, h\u2206 ) = 1,\nand since h\u2206 is even, m must be odd. Moreover, when m is odd, (m, h\u2206 ) = 1 if and only if (m, h\u2217\u2206 ) = 1.\nThe value for d in this case is obtained as above.\nFinally, we assume char(k) = 2. In this case the Nakayama automorphism of A is the identity, and thus\n\u2217\n\u223c\n\u223c\n\u03bd\u0303 is induced by h\u2217\u2206 \u2212 1 \u2208 Z/hmi. We thus have \u03a9\u22123\nAe (A) = DA[\u22121] = A[\u2212h\u2206 ], from which we obtain\n\u22123d\n\u223c\n\u223c\n\u03a9B e (B) = 1 B\u03c4 \u2212dh\u2217\u2206 = \u03c4 dh\u2217\u2206 B1 . We now see that the latter is isomorphic to DB \u223c\n= \u03c4 h\u2217\u2206 \u22121 B1 if and only if\ndh\u2217\u2206 \u2261 h\u2217\u2206 \u2212 1 (mod m). Clearly, this is possible if and only if (h\u2217\u2206 , m) = 1, and in this case we again obtain\nd \u2261 1 \u2212 (h\u2217\u2206 )\u22121 (mod m). \u0003\nTheorem 6.1 now follows immediately from the above theorem, using Proposition 2.1 and the description\nof the mesh algebras given at the beginning of the section.\n7. Generalized preprojective algebras and the torsion order 2 case\nWe now move on to study the stable Calabi-Yau properties of the representation-finite self-injective\nalgebras having torsion order t = 2. These algebras fall into three classes corresponding to their Dynkin type.\nMore specifically, the possible types here are (A2n+1 , s, 2), (Dn , s, 2) and (E6 , s, 2) with s \u2208 N. Unfortunately,\nthe lifting methods used above are not as well-suited for this case. Already, in [17], we found that we could\nnot find exact values for the periods of these algebras, due to the possibility that some syzygy \u03a9Ae (A) could\nbe a nontrivially twisted bimodule which lifts to the regular bimodule over a double cover of the algebra.\nIn general, there do exist nontrivial outer automorphisms that lift to inner autmorphisms in this way, and\nhence could provide such a twisting, but we know of no elementary means of detecting them in syzygies.\nFor now, we avoid this problem altogether by lifting the minimal resolutions of generalized preprojective\nalgebras to obtain information about the relevant stable Auslander algebras. The drawback of this approach\nis that not all the stable Auslander algebras that occur are coverings of generalized preprojective algebras.\nWe thus will only be able to derive some partial results for the time being. In particular, for the cases\n(A2n+1 , s, 2) and (Dn , s, 2), we obtain precise results concerning stable Calabi-Yau dimensions only when s\nis odd. We also get some new (although still incomplete) information about the periods of algebras of types\n(Dn , s, 2) and (E6 , s, 2).\n14\n\n\fWe let \u0393 be the stable Auslander algebra of \u039b, which is isomorphic to the mesh algebra of the translation\nquiver Z\u2206/h\u03c1\u03c4 sm\u2206 i, where \u03c12 = 1. We let B be the mesh algebra of Z\u2206/h\u03c4 2sm\u2206 i, which is a 2-fold Galois\ncover of \u0393, with Galois group generated by x = \u03c1\u03c4 sm\u2206 . We thus consider \u0393 with the corresponding Z/h2igrading. As in the last section, we also consider B as a Galois cover of the preprojective algebra A = P (\u2206).\nAs in the last section, we give \u2206 a bipartite orientation and assign the associated \"half\"-grading to A. This\ngives the following schemata of coverings between translation quivers and their mesh algebras.\nZ\u2206/h\u03c1\u03c4 m\u2206 s i \u2190\u2212\n\u0393\n\nZ\u2206/h\u03c4 2m\u2206 s i\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nB\n\nZ\u2206/h\u03c4 i\nA = P (\u2206)\n\n\u223c\nNow suppose \u03a9\u22123d\n\u0393e (\u0393) = D\u0393 for some d > 0. As graded bimodules, we either have D\u0393 or D\u0393[x]. Hence,\n\u22123d\n\u223c\nlifting to B we obtain \u03a9B e (B) \u223c\n= DB or \u03a9\u22123d\nB e (B) = DBx . We begin each of the following cases by applying\nour results from the previous section to investigate for which values of d and s these isomorphisms hold.\n\u223c\nHowever, such isomorphisms alone do not guarantee that \u03a9\u22123d\n\u0393e (\u0393) = D\u0393, as it is not hard to find outer\n\u223c\nautomorphisms \u03c3 of \u0393 such that F (D\u0393\u03c3 ) = F (D\u0393) as bimodules.\n\n7.1. Type (A2n+1 , s, 2). We now assume that \u039b is a representation-finite self-injective algebra of type\n(A2n+1 , s, 2) with n, s \u2265 1. The AR-quiver of \u039b has the form ZA2n+1 /h\u03c4 (2n+1)s \u03c1i where \u03c1 is the automorphism given by reflection in the horizontal central line of ZA2n+1 . We set m = s(2n + 1) and x = \u03c1\u03c4 m .\n\u22126\n\u223c\n\u223c\nProposition 6.2 implies that \u03a9\u22123\nB e (B) = 1 DB\u03c4 \u22121 and \u03a9B e (B) = 1 B\u03c4 \u2212(2n+2) . Hence, for r \u2265 0\n(7.1)\n\n\u22123\u22126r\n\u223c\n\u03a9\u22126r\n(B) \u223c\n= 1 DB\u03c4 \u22121\u2212r(2n+2) .\nB e (B) = 1 B\u03c4 \u2212r(2n+2) and \u03a9B e\n\nLemma 7.1. If \u039b (as above) is stably d-Calabi-Yau, then s \u2261 n (mod 2) and d is even.\n\u22123d\n\u223c\nProof. We suppose that \u03a9\u22123d\n(\u0393) cannot be isomorphic\n\u0393e (\u0393) = D\u0393. Notice that as a graded bimodule, \u03a9\n\u22123d\n\u223c\nto D\u0393, for such an isomorphism would lift to an isomorphism \u03a9 (B) = DB contradicting the requirement\nof Theorem 6.3 that (2m, h\u2217\u2206 ) = 1. Thus we must have \u03a9\u22123d (\u0393) \u223c\n= D\u0393[x], which lifts to\n\n\u03a9\u22123d (B) \u223c\n= 1 B\u03c4 m\u2212n .\n= \u03c1\u03c4 n B\u03c1\u03c4 m \u223c\n= DB\u03c1\u03c4 m \u223c\n= DBx \u223c\nWe have used that the Nakayama automorphism of B is \u03bd\u03c4 n by Lemma 5.2 and Proposition 6.2, where \u03bd\nrepresents the extension of the Nakayama automorphism of A. Furthermore, although \u03bd multiplies some\narrows by \u22121, it is not hard to see that it differs from \u03c1 by an inner automorphism since the quiver of B is\na wreath with even circumference.\nAs shown above in (7.1), a twist of B by a power of \u03c4 can only occur in a 6rth -cosyzygy. Hence d must\nbe even, and we must have\n(7.2)\n\n(\u2212n \u2212 1)d \u2261 m \u2212 n (mod 2m),\n\nwhich forces m \u2212 n to be even. Thus m = (2n + 1)s \u2261 s \u2261 n (mod 2). \u0003\nWe now assume that s and n are odd. In this case the stable AR-quiver of \u039b is an m-fold covering of the\nstable translation quiver QBn+1 , whose mesh algebra A is the generalized preprojective algebra P (Bn+1 ). As\nfor the preprojective algebras, we can give P (Bn+1 ) a half-grading corresponding to this covering by assigning\ndegrees of 0 and 1 to the arrows as indicated below.

In the stable category C(R), one knows that \u03a9 \u223c\n= Id.\n= \u03c4 and \u03a92 \u223c\nFurthermore, \u03a9\u03c4 \u223c\n= Id is a Serre functor, and we see that C(R) is a 2-Calabi-Yau triangulated category (see\n\u223c \u223c\n[41]). Hence, Proposition 2.1 implies that \u03a9\u22126\nAe (A) = A = DA.\nWe must now analyze the resolution described in Section 4 in order to determine the degrees in which\nthe syzygies are generated. Note that since ZA2n+1 is the universal cover of QBn+1 , the indecomposable\nprojective A-modules will have the same Loewy length as the indecomposable projective P (A2n+1 )-modules,\nwhich is hA2n+1 \u2212 1 = 2n + 1. Thus DA is generated in degree \u2212n and we have a graded isomorphism\nDA[n] \u223c\n= A. As demonstrated for the preprojective algebras in the proof of Proposition 6.2, P2 is generated\nin degree 1. Furthermore, the generators \u03bei of L = \u03a93 (A) are each homogeneous of degree 1 + n, so \u03a96Ae (A)\n\u223c\n\u223c\nwill be generated in degree 2n + 2 = hA2n+1 . This yields \u03a9\u22126r\nAe (A) = A[\u2212(2n + 2)r] = DA[n \u2212 (2n + 2)r], and\n\u22126r\n\u223c\napplying the lifting functor F gives us \u03a9\u0393e (\u0393) = 1 D\u0393\u03c4 n\u2212(2n+2)r . Thus mod-\u039b is 2r-Calabi-Yau if and only\nif (2n + 2)r \u2261 n (mod s(2n + 1)). This is possible if and only if (2n + 2, s)|n, and since (2n + 2, n) = 1 (as n\nis odd), this condition is equivalent to (2n + 2, s) = 1 or even (n + 1, s) = 1 (as s is odd).\nWe summarize what we have found in the following proposition. The very last assertion follows from the\ncongruence (7.2). The uncertainty in the case where n is even is resolved in Proposition 9.6.\nProposition 7.2. Let \u039b be a representation-finite self-injective algebra of type (A2n+1 , s, 2).\n(1) If n is odd, then mod-\u039b is d-Calabi-Yau if and only if (n + 1, s) = 1. In this case d = 2r with\nr \u2261 n(2n + 2)\u22121 (mod s(2n + 1)) and 0 < r < s(2n + 1).\n(2) If n is even and mod-\u039b is d-Calabi-Yau, then s is even and (n + 1, s) = 1. \u0003\n7.2. Type (Dn , s, 2). Now suppose \u039b has type (Dn , s, 2). The stable Auslander algebra \u0393 of \u039b coincides\nwith the mesh algebra of ZDn /h\u03c1\u03c4 (2n\u22123)s i, where \u03c1 is the automorphism induced by the order 2 graph\nautomorphism of Dn . As above, we let B be the mesh algebra of ZDn /h\u03c4 2s(2n\u22123) i which is a degree-2 cover\n\u223c\nof \u0393 and a degree-2s(2n \u2212 3) cover of A = P (Dn ). By Proposition 6.2 we have \u03a9\u22123\nAe (A) = DA[\u22121] and\n\u22126\n\u223c\n\u03a9Ae (A) = A[2 \u2212 2n]. Lifting to B, we have\n(7.3) \u03a9\u22126r (B) \u223c\n= 1 B\u03c4 (2\u22122n)r\n\nand \u03a9\u22123\u22126r (B) \u223c\n= DB\u03c4 \u22121+r(2\u22122n) \u223c\n= \u03bd\u03c4 n\u22122 B\u03c4 \u22121+r(2\u22122n) \u223c\n= 1 B\u03bd\u03c4 1\u2212n+r(2\u22122n) .\n\nHere, \u03bd is induced by the Nakayama automorphism of A, which is the identity if n is even, and corresponds\nto the order 2 automorphism \u03c1 of Dn when n is odd. We have also used that the Nakayama automorphism\nof B is \u03bd\u0303 = \u03bd\u03c4 n\u22122 according to Lemma 5.2 and Proposition 6.2. While \u03bd multiplies the degree-one arrows by\n\u22121, since the quiver of B is a wreath of even circumference we can compose \u03bd\u0303 with an inner automorphism\nso that it takes arrows to arrows. We may thus assume that \u03bd\u0303 = \u03c4 n\u22122 or \u03c1\u03c4 n\u22122 when n is even or odd,\nrespectively.\nNow suppose that \u03a9\u22123d (\u0393) \u223c\n= D\u0393. To lift this to an isomorphism of B-bimodules we must consider\ntwo cases. If \u03a9\u22123d (\u0393) \u223c\n= D\u0393[x] as\n= DB; while if \u03a9\u22123d (\u0393) \u223c\n= D\u0393 as Z/h2i-graded bimodules, then \u03a9\u22123d (B) \u223c\n\u22123d\n\u223c\nZ/h2i-graded bimodules, then \u03a9 (B) = 1 DB\u03c1\u03c4 s(2n\u22123) , where x is the generator of Z/h2i and corresponds to\nthe automorphism \u03c1\u03c4 s(2n\u22123) of ZDn /h\u03c4 2s(2n\u22123) i. We first consider the case \u03a9\u22123d (B) \u223c\n= DB. By Theorem 6.3,\nwe would have (2s(2n \u2212 3), 2n \u2212 2) = 1 when n is odd \u2013 which is clearly false \u2013 or else (2s(2n \u2212 3), n \u2212 1) = 1\n16\n\n\fwhen n is even. Note that the latter is then equivalent to (s, n \u2212 1) = 1. Theorem 6.3(1) also yields\nd \u2261 1 \u2212 (n \u2212 1)\u22121 (mod 2s(2n \u2212 3)), which forces d to be even.\nIn the remaining case, \u03a9\u22123d (B) \u223c\n= 1 DB\u03c1\u03c4 s(2n\u22123) \u223c\n= \u03bd\u0303 B\u03c1\u03c4 s(2n\u22123) . If n is even, this module is isomorphic to\nB\n.\nHowever,\nthis\ncannot\noccur\nsince\n(7.3)\nshows that \u03a9\u22126r (B) \u223c\ns(2n\u22123)\u2212n+2\n= 1 B\u03c4 r(2\u22122n) and \u03a9\u22123\u22126r (B) \u223c\n=\n1 \u03c1\u03c4\n1 B\u03c4 1\u2212n+r(2\u22122n) when n is even, and \u03c1 is not an inner automorphism. On the other hand, if n is odd, we get\n\u03a9\u22123d (B) \u223c\n= 1 B\u03c4 s(2n\u22123)\u2212n+2 . It follows from (7.3) that d is even and s(2n\u22123)\u2212n+2 \u2261 (1\u2212n)d (mod 2s(2n\u22123)).\nIn particular, we see that s(2n \u2212 3) \u2212 n + 2 is even. Consequently, if n is odd, then s too must be odd.\nWe now assume that s is odd, but do not place any restrictions on n. In this case the stable ARquiver of \u039b, which has the form ZDn /h\u03c1\u03c4 s(2n\u22123) i, is an s(2n \u2212 3)-fold cover of the translation quiver QCn\u22121 ,\nwhich is obtained by factoring out the action of the cyclic group of automorphisms genereated by \u03c1\u03c4 . The\nstable Auslander algebra \u0393 is thus a Galois cover of the generalized preprojective algebra P (Cn\u22121 ), and the\ncorresponding grading on the latter algebra is indicated below. On the right is a piece of the AR-quiver of\n\u039b with the vertex labels showing the covering morphism.\n0 ^>>>\n>>>>1\n>>>>\n0 >>>\u001e\n@ 2o\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n1\n\n/\n\n3o\n\n1\n0\n\n/ *** o\n\n/n\n\ns9 0 I\nsss\ns\ns\ns\n/1_\n2 KK\nKKK\nKK u\n%\n***\n93I\ns\ns\ns\ns\ns\nss\n4 KK\nKKK\nKK u\n%\n5\n\n:1I\nuu\nuu\nu\nu\nII / 0 _\nII\nII\n$ u\n:3I\nu\nu\nI\nu\nI$ uuu\nu: 4 III\nII\nu\nI$ u\n5\n..\n.\n\nI\n_\nu\n\nI\n_ $/ : 2\nu\n\nu: 0\nuu\nI$ uuu\n_ /: 2 I\n/\nu II 1\nII\nI$\nu: 3\nI\nuu\nI$ uuu\nu: 4 III\nII\nu\nI$\n5\n\nI\n_\nu\n\nKK\n\nKK\n_ _ _ % /9 2\nss\nss\nK K ***\nKK\n%\n94\ns\ns\nss\n\nAs in our previous analysis, we use the fact that QCn\u22121 is the stable AR-quiver of the category C(R)\nof Cohen-Macaulay modules over the simple plane curve singularity R = k[[x, y]]/(x2 + y 2n\u22122 ) of type\n\u223c\n\u223c\nA2n\u22123 . Thus, setting A := P (Cn\u22121 ), we have as above \u03a9\u22126\nAe (A) = DA = A. To calculate the grading\non the minimal resolution P\u2022 of A, we observe that the indecomposable projective A-modules have Loewy\nlength hDn \u2212 1 = 2n \u2212 3. It follows that DA is generated in degree \u2212(n \u2212 2) and hence DA \u223c\n= A[2 \u2212 n].\nNext, observe that as for the preprojective algebras, P1 is generated in degree 1. To find the degree of the\ngenerators \u03bei of \u03a93Ae (A), notice that each term of the form \u03c4 (x) \u2297 x\u2217 as in (4.4) will have degree equal to\n(|x|+|x\u2217 |)/2 = n\u22122, since the numerator is always one less than the Loewy length 2n\u22123 of an indecomposable\nprojective. Thus \u03a93Ae (A) is generated in degree n \u2212 1, and we must then have \u03a96Ae (A) \u223c\n= A[2n \u2212 2].\n\u22126r\n\u223c\n\u223c\nNow we will have \u03a9\u22126r\n(A)\nDA\nas\ngraded\nbimodules,\nor\nequivalently\n\u03a9\n(\u0393)\nD\u0393,\nif\nand only if\n=\n=\ne\ne\nA\n\u0393\n(2 \u2212 2n)r \u2261 2 \u2212 n (mod s(2n \u2212 3)). Thus we obtain the following result.\nProposition 7.3. Let \u039b be a representation-finite self-injective algebra of type (Dn , s, 2).\n(1) If s is odd, then mod-\u039b is d-Calabi-Yau if and only if (n \u2212 1, s) = 1. In this case the minimal such\nd is 2r with r \u2261 (n \u2212 2)(2n \u2212 2)\u22121 (mod s(2n \u2212 3)) and 0 < r < s(2n \u2212 3).\n(2) If s is even and mod-\u039b is d-Calabi-Yau, then (n \u2212 1, s) = 1.\n(3) If s > 1 is odd, then the period of \u039b is 2s(2n\u22123)\n(s,n\u22121) . \u0003\n6s(2n\u22123)/(s,2n\u22122)\nFor (3), we have used the isomorphism \u03a96\u0393e (\u0393) \u223c\n(\u0393) \u223c\n= 1 \u0393\u03c4 2n\u22122 to get \u03a9\u0393e\n= 1 \u03931 . Thus \u0393 has\nperiod dividing 6s(2n \u2212 3)/(s, n \u2212 1), and hence \u039b has period dividing 2s(2n \u2212 3)/(s, n \u2212 1) by Theorem\n4.2(2) of [17] (this requires s > 1 so that \u039b is Schurian). But this coincides with the lower bound for the\nperiod of \u039b that was computed in [17]. In Proposition 9.7, we supplement parts (2) and (3) with additional\ninformation in the case where s is even and n is odd.\n\n7.3. Type (E6 , s, 2). We now assume \u039b is a representation-finite self-injective algebra of type (E6 , s, 2).\nThe stable AR-quiver of \u039b then has the form ZE6 /h\u03c1\u03c4 11s i where \u03c1 is the automorphism of ZE6 induced by\nthe order-2 graph automorphism of E6 . The stable Auslander algebra \u0393 of \u039b is the mesh algebra of this\ntranslation quiver. As above, we begin by looking at the double cover B of \u0393, given by the mesh algebra of\nZE6 /h\u03c4 22s i, and we let A = P (E6 ) for the time being.\n17\n\n\f\u223c\nAssume that \u03a9\u22123d\n\u0393e (\u0393) = D\u0393. If this is an isomorphism of Z/2-graded bimodules, then it lifts to an\n\u22123d\nisomorphism \u03a9B e (B) \u223c\n= DB, which leads to a contradiction (22s, 12) = 1 by Theorem 6.3. Thus, we must\n\u223c\nhave instead \u03a9\u22123d\n(B)\n= 1 DB\u03c1\u03c4 11s . Now, DB \u223c\n= \u03c1\u03c4 5 B1 by Lemma 5.2 and Proposition 6.2. Thus\n= \u03bd\u0303 B1 \u223c\nBe\n\u22123d\n\u22126r\n\u223c\n\u223c\n\u03a9B e (B) = 1 B\u03c4 11s\u22125 . Over A, we have \u03a9Ae (A) = A[\u221212r] and \u03a9\u22123\u22126r\n(A) \u223c\n= DA[\u22121 \u2212 12r]. Only the first\nAe\nof these isomorphisms will lift to one of the desired form over B, and we see that d = 2r will be even, and\nwe need \u221212r \u2261 11s \u2212 5 (mod 22s). In particular, we see that s must be odd.\nSince we now know that s is odd, we can regard \u0393 as a Galois cover of the generalized preprojective\nalgebra A = P (F4 ). The relevant half-grading of A is given below, and the figure on the right shows a piece\nof the AR-quiver of \u039b.

As above,\none can check using the minimal resolution of A that \u03a93Ae (A) is generated in degree 1 + (hE6 /2 \u2212 1) = 6\n\u223c\n\u223c\nand hence \u03a9\u22126\nAe (A) = A[\u221212]. One also checks as before that DA = A[\u22125]. It now follows that, in order for\n\u22126r\n\u223c\n\u03a9\u0393e (\u0393) = D\u0393, we need 12r \u2261 5 (mod 11s). Summarizing, we have the following.\nProposition 7.4. Let \u039b be a representation-finite self-injective algebra of type (E6 , s, 2).\n(1) mod-\u039b is d-Calabi-Yau for some d if and only if (s, 6) = 1. In this case the minimal d is given by\nd = 2r, where r \u2261 5 * 12\u22121 (mod 11s) and 0 < r < 11s.\n(2) If s > 1 is odd, then the period of \u039b is 22s/(s, 6). \u0003\n\u223c\nAs in 7.2, the period of \u039b in part (2) is obtained by finding the minimal p > 0 such that \u03a93p\nAe (A) = A as\nZ/h11si-graded bimodules. We compute the periods when s is even in Proposition 9.8.\n8. Some results on G2 -mesh algebras\nIt is already known that the representation-finite self-injective algebras of type (D4 , s, 3) are not stably\nCalabi-Yau for any s [8]. We do not repeat the proof here: one simply checks that no power of the syzygy\noperator induces the Nakayama permutation on the simple modules. However the m-fold mesh algebras\nof Dynkin type G2 are still of interest. In particular, knowledge of their homology would help determine\nthe periods of the self-injective algebras of type (D4 , s, 3) \u2013 a question which was left unresolved in [17].\nThus we devote this section to investigating the minimal graded resolution of the generalized preprojective\nalgebra P (G2 ), and to describing what information we can extract about the m-fold mesh algebras of type\nG2 . We point out that the translation quiver QG2 does not arise as the stable AR-quiver of the category of\nCohen-Macaulay modules over a simple curve singularity, so we must start from scratch.\nWe set A = P (G2 ), which is the mesh algebra of the translation quiver below.\n\n\u03b3\n\n\b\n1o\n\n\u03c3(\u03b3)\n\u03b1\n\n/\n\n@ 2\\\n\u03c3(\u03b2)\n\n0 ^>>>\n>>>>\u03b2\n>>>>\n\u03c3(\u03b1) >>>\u001e\n23\n18\n\n\fe0 B\nB \u2217 e0\ne0\n\u03b1\u03c3(\u03b3)\u03b1\u03c3(\u03b3)\n\u03b1\n\u03c3(\u03b3)\u03b1\u03c3(\u03b3)\n\u03b2\n\u03c3(\u03b1)\u03b2\u03c3(\u03b1)\n\u03b3\n\u03c3(\u03b2)\u03b3\u03c3(\u03b2)\n\u03b1\u03c3(\u03b3)\n\u03b1\u03c3(\u03b3)\n\u03b2\u03c3(\u03b1)\n\u2212\u03b3\u03c3(\u03b2)\n\u03b3\u03c3(\u03b2)\u03b3\n\u03c3(\u03b2)\n\u03b1\u03c3(\u03b3)\u03b1\n\u03c3(\u03b3)\n\u03b2\u03c3(\u03b1)\u03b2\n\u03c3(\u03b1)\n\u03b1\u03c3(\u03b3)\u03b1\u03c3(\u03b3)\ne0\n\ne1 B\nB \u2217 e3\ne1\n\u03c3(\u03b3)\u03b1\u03c3(\u03b3)\u03b2\n\u03c3(\u03b3)\n\u03b1\u03c3(\u03b3)\u03b2\n\u03c3(\u03b3)\u03b1\n\u03c3(\u03b3)\u03b2\n\u03c3(\u03b3)\u03b2\n\u2212\u03c3(\u03b1)\u03b2\n\u03c3(\u03b3)\u03b1\u03c3(\u03b3)\n\u03b2\n\u03c3(\u03b3)\u03b1\u03c3(\u03b3)\u03b2\ne3\n\ne2 B\nB \u2217 e1\ne2\n\u03c3(\u03b2)\u03b3\u03c3(\u03b2)\u03b1\n\u03c3(\u03b2)\n\u03b3\u03c3(\u03b2)\u03b1\n\u03c3(\u03b2)\u03b3\n\u03c3(\u03b2)\u03b1\n\u03c3(\u03b2)\u03b1\n\u2212\u03c3(\u03b3)\u03b1\n\u03c3(\u03b2)\u03b3\u03c3(\u03b2)\n\u03b1\n\u03c3(\u03b2)\u03b3\u03c3(\u03b2)\u03b1\ne1\n\ne3 B\nB \u2217 e2\ne3\n\u03c3(\u03b1)\u03b2\u03c3(\u03b1)\u03b3\n\u03c3(\u03b1)\n\u03b2\u03c3(\u03b1)\u03b3\n\u03c3(\u03b1)\u03b2\n\u03c3(\u03b1)\u03b3\n\u03c3(\u03b1)\u03b3\n\u2212\u03c3(\u03b2)\u03b3\n\u03c3(\u03b1)\u03b2\u03c3(\u03b1)\n\u03b3\n\u03c3(\u03b1)\u03b2\u03c3(\u03b1)\u03b3\ne2\n\nTable 8.1. A basis B for P (G2 ), and its dual B \u2217 .\n\nNotice that the Nakayama permutation \u03c0 of A agrees with \u03c4 on vertices. Each indecomposable projective\nA-module has Loewy length hD4 \u2212 1 = 5. To lift our results to m-fold mesh algebras of type G2 , we will give\nA a G = Z/hmi grading by assigning degree 0 to the arrows \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and degree 1 to the remaining arrows. If\n3 \u2224 m, we have A#k[G]\u2217 \u223c\n= k(ZD4 /h\u03c1\u03c4 m i) where \u03c1 is induced by an order 3 automorhpism of D4 . If 3 | m,\n\u2217 \u223c\nthen A#k[G] = k(ZD4 /h\u03c4 m i).\nProposition 8.1. \u03a93Ae (A) \u223c\n= 1 A\u03bc where \u03bc is the automorphism of A that sends \u03b1 7\u2192 \u2212\u03b1, \u03b2 7\u2192 \u2212\u03b2 and\n\u03b3 7\u2192 \u2212\u03b3, and fixes the remaining arrows and vertices of QG2 . Moreover, with the grading described above,\n\u03a96Ae (A) \u223c\n= A[6]; while \u03a93Ae (A) \u223c\n= 1 A\u03bc [3], which is isomorphic to A[3] if and only if char(k) = 2.\nProof. To find \u03a93Ae (A) using the resolution from Section 4, we must first calculate its generators \u03b6i for\ni = 0, 1, 2, 3. Since these are defined in terms of a pair of dual bases with respect to the bilinear form (\u2212, \u2212),\nwe specify such a pair in Table 8.1.\nFor \u03be = \u03be0 + * * * + \u03be3 , one can now compute \u03be * a = \u03bc(a)\u03be for each arrow a in QG2 , where \u03bc is as described\nabove. Thus 1 7\u2192 \u03be defines an isomorphism 1 A\u03bc \u223c\n= \u03a93Ae (A). Clearly \u03bc is a nontrivial outer automorphism\nunless char(k) = 2. Furthermore, as in the proof of Proposition 6.2, we see that the P1 term of the minimal\nresolution of A is generated in degree 1, and each \u03bei has degree 2. Thus \u03a93Ae (A) is generated in degree 3. \u0003\nAs in Section 7, these isomorphisms lift to the stable Auslander algebras of the representation-finite selfinjective algebras of type (D4 , s, 3) when 3 \u2224 s. Then Theorem 4.2 of [17] allows us to deduce the following\ninformation about the periods of these algebras.\nCorollary 8.2. Let \u039b be a representation-finite self-injective algebra of type (D4 , s, 3), and assume that 3 \u2224 s\nand s > 1.\n(1) If char(k) = 2, then \u039b has period 5s.\n(2) If char(k) 6= 2, then \u039b has period 10s/(s, 2). \u0003\n9. Alternate approach: Triangulated orbit categories\nWe now describe another means of calculating the CY-dimensions and \u03a3-periods of Hom-finite triangulated\ncategories with finitely many indecomposables. The basic idea, pursued originally by Holm and J\u00f8rgensen\n[29], is to apply Amiot's characterization of such categories via covering theory [1], while paying close\nattention to technical aspects of the covering theory of triangulated categories as demonstrated to us by\nBernhard Keller [35, 32]. In particular, this approach permits us to complement our previous calculations\nfor the stable categories of representation-finite self-injective algebras, and we illustrate the process with\nseveral computations which eluded our previous methods. In particular, we determine:\n\u2022 The stable CY-dimensions of the representation-finite self-injective algebras of type (A2n+1 , s, 2) for\neven n.\n19\n\n\f\u2022 The periods of the representation-finite self-injective algebras of type (Dn , s, 2) when n is odd and s\nis even.\n\u2022 The periods of the representation-finite self-injective algebras of type (E6 , s, 2) with s even.\nSimilar arguments can also be used to compute the stable CY-dimensions and periods of most other\nrepresentation-finite self-injective algebras, and even the CY-dimensions of algebraic triangulated categories\nwith only finitely many indecomposables. However, the current limitation of this approach occurs for triangulated categories with AR-quivers of the form ZD2n /(\u03c1\u03c4 m ) where \u03c1 has order 2 (or 3 when n = 2). The\nreason behind this difficulty is explained in the remarks preceding Propostion 9.7.\nFirst of all, if C is a k-linear category and F : C \u2192 C is an automorphism, the orbit category C/F is\ndefined to be the category with the same objects as C, and with morphisms\nM\nC/F (x, y) =\nC(x, F i y).\ni\u2208Z\n\ni\n\nj\n\nIf g : x \u2192 F y and f : y \u2192 F z, then the composite of g and f in C/F is given by F i (f ) \u25e6 g : x \u2192 F i+j z.\n\u223c\n=\nThere is a natural projection functor \u03c0 : C \u2192 C/F , together with an isomorphism of functors \u03b7 : \u03c0 \u2212\u2192 \u03c0F\ngiven by the identity maps \u03b7x = 1x for each x \u2208 C.\nBelow, we want to consider orbit categories of a triangulated category (D, \u03a3) relative to an auto-equivalence\nF . In order to define such an orbit category, we must first pass to a skeleton C of D and consider instead\nthe orbit category of C with respect to the automorphism of C that corresponds to F (Cf. [4] Remark 3.8).\nHowever, in this exchange, we must pay close attention to the triangulated structure of D. To make this\ntreatment more precise, we let I : C \u2192 D be the inclusion functor and choose isomorphisms \u03bcx : x \u2192 x0 with\nx0 \u2208 C for each x \u2208 D such that \u03bcx = 1x for each x \u2208 C. This defines a retraction J : D \u2192 C via J(x) = x0\n\u223c\n=\non objects and J(f ) = \u03bcy f \u03bc\u22121\nx on morphisms f \u2208 D(x, y), and we have JI = 1C and \u03bc : 1D \u2212\u2192 IJ. In\n\u2032\norder to make C into a triangulated category, we define a new suspension \u03a3 := J\u03a3I : C \u2192 C, and define the\ndistinguished triangles to be those isomorphic to a sequence of the form\nJf\n\nJg\n\nJA \u2192 JB \u2192 JC\nf\n\ng\n\nJ(\u03a3(\u03bcA )h)\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\n\u03a3\u2032 JA\n\nh\n\nwhere A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 \u03a3A is a distinguished triangle in D. The axioms for triangulated categories (as stated\n\u2032\nin [25]) can now be verified for C by using the fact that the functor [I, \u03bc\u22121\n\u03a3I : I\u03a3 \u2192 \u03a3I] takes a triangle in\nC to a triangle in D, and the latter triangle is returned to the former by the functor [J, J\u03a3(\u03bc) : J\u03a3 \u2192 \u03a3\u2032 J].\nFor instance, the rotation axiom (TR2) is checked via the following commutative diagram:\nJB\n\nJg\n\n/ JC\n\nJh\n\n/ J\u03a3A\n\n\u2212J\u03a3(\u03bcb f )\n\n/ \u03a3\u2032 (JB)\n\nJ\u03a3(\u03bcA )\n\nJB\n\nJg\n\n/ JC\n\nJ(\u03a3(\u03bcA\n\n\u000f\n/ \u03a3\u2032 JA\n)h)\nJf\n\n\u2212\u03a3\u2032 Jf\nJg\n\n/ \u03a3\u2032 (JB)\nJ(\u03a3(\u03bcA )h)\n\nThe bottom row is the rotation of a typical triangle JA \u2192 JB \u2192 JC\n\u2212\u2192 \u03a3\u2032 JA in C; while the top\nf\ng\nh\nrow is the image under J of the rotation of the triangle A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 \u03a3A in D, and is hence a triangle in\nC by definition. Since the vertical maps are all isomorphisms, the bottom row is also a triangle in C. With\nrespect to this triangulated structure on C it is now immediate that the exact functors [I, \u03bc\u22121\n\u03a3I ] and [J, J\u03a3(\u03bc)]\nprovide an equivalence of triangulated categories between (C, \u03a3\u2032 ) and (D, \u03a3). If F is an auto-equivalence of\nD, then the corresponding automorphism of C is F \u2032 = JF I. Moreover, if S is a Serre functor for D, then\nthe automorphism S \u2032 = JSI is easily checked to be a Serre functor for C.\nIn general, if C is triangulated and F is exact, C/F does not inherit a triangulated structure. However,\nKeller demonstrated in [31] that if C is triangle equivalent to the bounded derived category Db (mod-k\u2206)\nwith \u2206 an oriented Dynkin graph, and F satisfies some mild hypotheses, then C/F is triangulated and\n\u03c0 : C \u2192 C/F is exact. In [1], Amiot goes on to characterize the triangulated categories that arise in this way.\nWe have rephrased the following theorem in light of the above interpretation of orbit categories relative to\nauto-equivalences. Moreover, from now on we will write Db (A) for the bounded derived category of mod-A.\n20\n\n\fTheorem 9.1 (Cf. [1], Theorem 7.0.5). Suppose that T is a standard, algebraic Hom-finite triangulated\ncategory with only finitely many indecomposables up to isomorphism. Then T is triangle equivalent to an\norbit category D/F with D a skeleton of Db (mod-kQ) for a Dynkin quiver Q and an exact automorphism F\nof D.\nClearly, the hypotheses of Amiot's theorem apply to T = mod-\u039b for a representation-finite standard\nself-injective k-algebra \u039b. Moreover, in order to find A := kQ and F , it suffices to match up the AR-quivers\nof T and Db (A)/F \u2013a task which can be easily accomplished using Happel's description of the AR-quivers of\nDb (A) and the effect of the suspension \u03a3 [24]. According to Happel, the AR-quiver of Db (k\u2206) is isomorphic\nto Z\u2206. Moreover, the category of indecomposables is realized by the mesh category: ind Db (k\u2206) \u2248 k(Z\u2206).\nFor the suspension functor \u03a3 on Db (k\u2206), we have \u03a32 \u223c\n= \u03c4 \u2212h\u2206 . Furthermore, S = \u03a3\u03c4 is a Serre functor\nb\non D (k\u2206). Finally the action of the suspension \u03a3 is given by the automorphism \u03c1\u2206 \u03c4 \u2212\u230ah\u2206 /2\u230b , where the\nautomorphism \u03c1\u2206 is the identity if \u2206 = D2n , E7 or E8 , and otherwise is as described in the definition of the\nm-fold mesh algebras in Section 3 (see Table I in [37]).\nExamples. (1) Let T = proj-A where A = P (Ln ) is the mesh algebra on QLn , and assume char(k) 6= 2.\nThe category T = proj-A is shown to be triangulated in [1]. However, the suspension functor \u03a3 is not\nthe identity as claimed there (due to what appears to be a misquoting of [6]); rather, it is induced by the\nautomorphism \u03c3 of A that fixes all vertices and all arrows other than \u01eb in the quiver QLn , while sending\n\u01eb 7\u2192 \u2212\u01eb [6]. One easily checks that this functor is not isomorphic to the identity functor, or, equivalently,\nthat the automorphism \u03c3 of A is not inner (except when char(k) = 2). Indeed, the endomorphism ring\nof Ae0 is generated as a k-algebra by \u01eb, and hence any endomorphism of Ae0 commutes with \u01eb, implying\nthat there is no endomorphism \u03b7Ae0 such that \u2212\u01eb\u03b7Ae0 \u223c\n= \u03b7Ae0 \u01eb. Since T is standard and algebraic, it can\nbe realized as an orbit category of some Db (kQ) with Q Dynkin. Since the AR-quiver of T coincides with\nthe bound quiver of P (Ln ), as a translation quiver it is ZA2n /h\u03c1\u03c4 i where \u03c1 = \u03c1A2n has order 2. Hence, as\nn\na triangulated category, T is equivalent to D/F where D is a skeleton of Db (kA2n ) and F = \u03c4D\n\u03a3D (The\n1\nAR-quiver of D is ZA2n and the automorphism induced by \u03a3D translates n + 2 units to the right and reflects\nin the center line: see eg. [37]).\n\u2212(2n+1) \u223c 2\nIn 7.4 of [31], Keller claims2 that the isomorphism of functors \u03c4D\n= \u03a3D in D induces the following\nisomorphisms in the orbit category T :\n(9.1)\n1T \u223c\n= \u03c4 \u22121 .\n= \u03c4 2n \u03a32 \u223c\n= F 2 = (\u03c4 n \u03a3T )2 \u223c\nT\n\nT\n\nT\n\nT\n\n\u223c \u03a3T \u2247 1T . See the Remark following Propo\u223c \u03c4T =\nHowever, this contradicts what we observed above: \u03c4T\u22121 =\nsition 9.6 for a discussion of the error in (9.1). Moreover, on one hand, we would like to say the functor\ninduced by F is \u03c4Tn \u03a3T , while on the other hand, the functor induced by F in D/F should be the identity.\nNevertheless, observe that \u03c4Tn \u03a3T \u223c\n= \u03c4Tn+1 \u2247 1T whenever n is even.\n(2) For another example, let T = mod-\u039b where \u039b is the representation-finite self-injective algebra of type\n(D6 , 5/3, 1). We assume that char(k) 6= 2. Since the stable AR-quiver of \u039b is isomorphic to ZD6 /h\u03c4 15 i, T\nis triangle equivalent to the orbit category D/F where D is a skeleton of Db (kD6 ) and F \u223c\n= \u03c4 15 (we fix any\norientation for D6 ). The AR-quiver of D is isomorphic to ZD6 , and the suspension \u03a3D acts on the AR-quiver\n\u22124\n\u22125\n. In\n. The Serre functor on D is SD = \u03a3D \u03c4D \u223c\nby shifting everything 5 units to the right: \u03a3D \u223c\n= \u03c4D\n= \u03c4D\nparticular, we see that we can take F = \u03a33D , which yields functorial isomorphisms\n(9.2)\n\u03a33 \u03c0 \u223c\n= \u03c0\u03a33 = \u03c0F \u223c\n= \u03c0,\nT\n\nD\n\nas the covering functor \u03c0 : D \u2192 D/F is exact with \u03c0 \u223c\n= \u03c0F . Since \u03c0 is dense, it follows that \u03a33T and 1T\nhave the same effect on the objects of T . However, this isomorphism does not guarantee that \u03a33T \u223c\n= 1T as \u03c0\nis not full. In fact, since \u039b is Schurian, an isomorphism \u03a33T \u223c\n= 1T would imply that \u03a93\u039be (\u039b) \u223c\n= \u039b (by Lemma\n4.4 of [17]), which contradicts the calculation in [17] that the (minimal) period of \u039b is 6.\nTo avoid the potential pitfalls illustrated above, we need to consider some extra structure on endofunctors\nof Db (A). Namely, in order to obtain well-defined induced endofunctors on the orbit category in which we\n2This claim has since been corrected [32].\n21\n\n\fare interested, we need to consider F -equivariant functors on Db (A). In particular, we need to keep track\nof how these endofunctors commute with F . To provide more detail, we now review some basic elements of\nthe theory recently introduced by Asashiba in [4].\nDefinition 9.2 (Cf. [4]). Let C be a k-linear category with an automorphism F : C \u2192 C. A (right) F invariant functor from C to C \u2032 is a pair (H, \u03c6) where H : C \u2192 C \u2032 is a k-linear functor and \u03c6 : H \u2192 HF is\nan isomorphism. A (weakly) F -equivariant functor on C is a pair (E, \u03c8) where E : C \u2192 C is a k-linear\nfunctor and \u03c8 : F E \u2192 EF is an isomorphism.\nWe point out that these terms are defined more generally in [4], with respect to a group G of automorphisms\nof C. For our purposes, G = hF i is always cyclic and it thus suffices to specify only one functorial isomorphism\nin each case. A morphism \u03b1 : (H, \u03c6) \u2192 (H \u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 ) of F -invariant functors is a morphism \u03b1 : H \u2192 H \u2032 satisfying\n\u03b1F x \u03c6x = \u03c6\u2032x \u03b1x for all x \u2208 C. Similarly, a morphism \u03b1 : (E, \u03c8) \u2192 (E \u2032 , \u03c8 \u2032 ) of F -equivariant functors is a\nmorphism \u03b1 : E \u2192 E \u2032 satisfying \u03c8x\u2032 \u25e6 F (\u03b1x ) = \u03b1F x \u25e6 \u03c8x for all x \u2208 C. We shall denote the categories of F invariant functors from C to C \u2032 and of F -equivariant functors on C by invF (C, C \u2032 ) and equF (C, C) respectively.\nObserve that the natural covering functor \u03c0 : C \u2192 C/F together with the isomorphism \u03b7 described above\nis an F -invariant functor. Furthermore, the orbit category C/F is characterized by the following universal\nproperty (cf. 2.6, 2.7 in [4]):\nFor every F -invariant functor (H, \u03c6) : C \u2192 C \u2032 there exists a unique functor G : C/F \u2192 C \u2032\n(up to isomorphism) such that (H, \u03c6) \u223c\n= (G\u03c0, G\u03b7) as F -invariant functors. Equivalently,\ncomposition with (\u03c0, \u03b7) induces an isomorphism of categories from the category funk (C/F, C \u2032 )\nof k-linear functors C/F \u2192 C \u2032 to the category invF (C, C \u2032 ) of F -invariant functors C \u2192 C \u2032 .\nConcerning composition, notice that the composite of two F -equivariant functors (E, \u03c8) and (E \u2032 , \u03c8 \u2032 )\nyields another F -equivariant functor (EE \u2032 , E(\u03c8 \u2032 ) \u25e6 \u03c8E \u2032 ). Furthermore, if (H, \u03c6) : C \u2192 C \u2032 is an F -invariant\nfunctor, then HE will inherit a natural F -invariant structure as well. To be precise, (HE, H(\u03c8)\u03c6E ) : C \u2192 C \u2032\nis F -invariant, and moreover one can check that these compositions are associative. In particular, taking\n(H, \u03c6) = (\u03c0, \u03b7), we get functors\n\u223c\n=\n\n(\u03c0,\u03b7)\u25e6\u2212\n\nequF (C, C) \u2212\u2192 invF (C, C/F ) \u2212\u2192 funk (C/F, C/F )\nwhich respect composition. Via this sequence of maps, we see that an F -equivariant functor (E, \u03c8) : C \u2192 C\ninduces a functor \u0112 : C/F \u2192 C/F . More precisely, the action of \u0112 on objects of C/F coincides with that of\nE on C, while \u0112 takes a map f : x \u2192 F y (regarded as a map in C/F ) to the composite\n\u03c8y\u22121\n\nEf\n\nEx \u2212\u2192 EF y \u2212\u2192 F Ey.\nOf special importance are the F -equivariant functors of the form (1C , \u01eb) where \u01eb : F \u2192 F is an isomorphism. We shall denote the induced functor \u2206(\u01eb) : C/F \u2192 C/F . To illustrate, consider the right\nF -equivariant functors (F, 1F 2 ) and (F, \u22121F 2 ). The composite (\u03c0, \u03b7)(F, 1F 2 ) = (\u03c0F, \u03b7F ) is isomorphic to\n(\u03c0, \u03b7) as an F -invariant functor via \u03b7 : \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0F . It follows that (F, 1F 2 ) induces the identity functor 1C/F .\nOn the other hand (F, \u22121F 2 ) is typically not isomorphic to (F, 1F 2 ) as an F -equivariant functor, and hence\nwill not necessarily induce the identity on C/F . In fact, as (F, \u22121F 2 ) = (1C , \u22121F ) \u25e6 (F, 1F 2 ), we see that the\nfunctor induced by (F, \u22121F 2 ) will coincide with \u2206(\u22121F ).\nLemma 9.3 (Keller [31, 32]). Let [F, \u03b1] : D \u2192 D be an exact automorphism of the triangulated category\n\u223c\n=\n(D, \u03a3) as in [31], where \u03b1 : F \u03a3 \u2212\u2192 \u03a3F . Then (\u03a3, \u03b1) is F -equivariant and induces the suspension \u03a3D/F of\nthe orbit category D/F . \u0003\nNotice that if we take [F, \u03b1] = [\u03a3, \u22121\u03a32 ], then the above remarks show that the suspension of the orbit\ncategory D/\u03a3 is isomorphic to \u2206(\u22121\u03a3 ), which is not isomorphic to the identity in general. Likewise, if we\nfactor out F = \u03a33 as in Example 2, we see that the functor induced on the orbit category by (\u03a33 , \u22121\u03a34 ) is\n\u03a33D/F \u223c\n= \u2206(\u22121D/F ) rather than the identity.\nWe now consider the relationship between the Serre functors of C and C/F . We assume that both C and\nC/F have finite-dimensional Hom-spaces, which is certainly true when C and F are as in the main theorem\n22\n\n\fof [31]. Recall from [33] that a Serre functor S : C \u2192 C is characterized by trace maps, which are functorial\nisomorphisms\ntx : C(\u2212, Sx) \u2192 DC(x, \u2212)\nnatural in x \u2208 C.

Suppose that C and C/F are Hom-finite triangulated categories and S is a Serre functor\non C.\n(a) The F -equivariant functor (S, \u03c3F\u22121 ) induces the Serre functor S of C/F .\n(b) We have \u03c3S = 1S 2 .\n(c) The (unique) enhancement of S into a triangle functor is given by [S, \u2212\u03c3\u03a3 ].\n(d) If F = F1 F2 for F1 , F2 \u2208 Aut(C), then \u03c3F = F1 (\u03c3F2 ) \u25e6 (\u03c3F1 )F2 .\nProof.

Let C be a skeleton of Db (A) with suspension \u03a3 and Serre functor S, which we may assume\n(m)\n\u22121\nare automorphisms, and set F = S m \u03a3d for m, d \u2208 Z. Then (\u03a3, (\u22121)d+m (\u03c3\u03a3 )\u03a3d ) and (S, S m (\u03c3\u03a3\nd )) are F equivariant functors inducing the suspension \u03a3C/F and Serre functor SC/F , respectively, on the orbit category\nC/F . In particular, we have\nm\n\u03a3dC/F \u223c\nSC/F\n= \u2206((\u22121)d(d+m) ).\n\nProof. We need to identify the correct F -equivariant structures on S and \u03a3. By Lemma 9.3, the F -equivariant\nstructure on \u03a3 comes from the isomorphism \u03b1 : F \u03a3 \u2192 \u03a3F that makes F into a triangle functor. As a triangle\n(m)\nfunctor F = [S, \u2212\u03c3\u03a3 ]m [\u03a3d , (\u22121)d * 1\u03a3d+1 ] \u223c\n= [S m \u03a3d , (\u22121)d+m (\u03c3\u03a3 )\u03a3d ]. In fact, the isomorphism \u03b1 here can\nbe seen by pasting together the left-most column of squares in the figure below. Thus \u03a3C/F is induced by\n(m)\n\n(\u03a3, (\u22121)d+m (\u03c3\u03a3 )\u03a3d ). For S we need to find \u03c3F : S m+1 \u03a3d \u2192 S m \u03a3d S. By Proposition 9.4(b), \u03c3S m = 1S m+1\nand hence \u03c3F = S m (\u03c3\u03a3d ) by Proposition 9.4(d). In the figure below, \u03c3F\u22121 is obtained by pasting the squares\nin the central column.\nNow we consider the F -equivariant structure on F obtained by writing F = (S, \u03c3F\u22121 )m \u25e6 (\u03a3, \u03b1)d . The\ncorresponding automorphism \u01eb of F 2 is then given as the composite\n(\u2212m)\n\nF S m \u03a3d\n\n(\u03c3F\n\n)\n\nd\n\n\u2212\u2192 \u03a3 S m F \u03a3d\n\nS m (\u03b1(d) )\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nS m \u03a3d F,\n\n(\u2212m)\nwhere \u03c3F\nand \u03b1(d) are shorthand for the isomorphisms F S m \u223c\n= S m F and F \u03a3d \u223c\n= \u03a3d F induced by \u03c3F\u22121\nand \u03b1 respectively. This construction of \u01eb is also illustrated in the diagram below, in which \u03b1(d) is obtained\n(\u2212m)\nby pasting the squares on the left half and \u03c3F\nis obtained by pasting the squares on the right half.

We now illustrate how it may be applied to determine the CYdimensions and \u03a3-periods of the finite type stable categories mod-\u039b. We begin by verifying the stable\nCalabi-Yau dimensions computed for the Moebius algebras in [29].\nProposition 9.6 (Cf. 7.1; [29], Theorem 5.2). Let \u039b be a representation-finite self-injective algebra of type\n(A2n+1 , s, 2). Then mod-\u039b is Calabi-Yau if and only if (n + 1, s) = 1 and n \u2261 s (mod 2). In this case the\nstable CY-dimension of \u039b is d = Kn,s (2n + 1) \u2212 1 where\n\u00df\nTM\nr(s + n + 1) \u2212 1\nKn,s := inf r r \u2265 1, r(n + 1) \u2261 1 (mod s), 2|\n.\ns\nProof. As the necessary conditions were already encountered in 7.1, we need only verify the claimed CYdimension. We thus assume that n \u2261 s (mod 2) and (n + 1, s) = 1. Recall that the AR-quiver of \u039b is\nisomorphic to ZA2n+1 /h\u03c1\u03c4 s(2n+1) i with \u03c12 = 1. Moreover, on a skeleton D of Db (mod-kA2n+1 ) we have\nisomorphisms \u03a3D \u223c\n= \u03a3D \u03c4 \u223c\n= \u03c1\u03c4 \u2212n . Thus mod-\u039b is realized as the orbit category D/F\n= \u03c1\u03c4 \u2212n\u22121 and SD \u223c\n\u2212s\u2212n n+1\u2212s\nwhere F = \u03a3D\nSD\n. Since n and s have the same parity, Theorem 9.5 implies that \u03a3s+n \u223c\n= S n+1\u2212s for\n\u223c 2(n+1) , we\nthe suspension \u03a3 and Serre functor S on mod-\u039b. Likewise, since we have an isomorphism \u03a32n\nD = SD\nn\u2212s \u2212s\u2212n\u22121\ncan realize mod-\u039b as the orbit category D/F \u2032 with F \u2032 = \u03a3D\nSD\n. Again by Theorem 9.5 we conclude\nn\u2212s \u223c n+s+1\n, and combining these isomorphisms yields \u03a32n \u223c\nthat \u03a3\n= S 2(n+1) on mod-\u039b. Now notice that\n=S\nby our choice of Kn,s , we get integers\nKn,s (n + 1) \u2212 1\nKn,s (s \u2212 n \u2212 1) + 1\nand b :=\ns\n2s\nsatisfying (n + 1 \u2212 s)a + 2(n + 1)b = 1. Consequently\nS = (S n+1\u2212s )a (S 2(n+1) )b \u223c\n= (\u03a3s+n )a (\u03a32n )b = \u03a3Kn,s (2n+1)\u22121 .\u0003\na :=\n\n25\n\n\fRemark. Returning briefly to Example (1) we can now identify the error in (9.1). In fact, it lies in the\n\u2212(2n+1) \u223c\nlast isomorphism \u03c4T2n \u03a32T \u223c\n= \u03a32D fails to pass down to the orbit cat= \u03c4T\u22121 as the isomorphism \u03c4D\n2n+1 \u223c\negory. Indeed, using the identity S = \u03a3\u03c4 we convert this isomorphism to SD\n, and attempt\n= \u03a32n\u22121\nD\nto mimic the argument in the above proof by applying Theorem 9.5 for two different choices of F . If\n\u2212(1+n) n\nn 1\u2212n\nn\n\u03a3D and F2 = SD\n\u03a3D , then the functors induced by F1 and F2 will differ by \u2206(\u22121),\nF1 = \u03c4D\n\u03a3D \u223c\n= SD\n\u2212(2n+1) \u223c\n2\nyielding \u03c4T\n= \u2206(\u22121) here.\n= \u03a3T \u223c\n= \u2206(\u22121)\u03a3T . In particular, \u03c4T \u223c\nWhile we would like to similarly apply Theorem 9.5 to compute the CY-dimensions for the stable categories\nof algebras of type (Dn , s, 2) when s is even, in this case the necessary automorphism F of D \u2248 Db (mod-kDn )\ncannot be expressed in terms of SD and \u03a3D alone. Indeed, we would need F = \u03c1\u03c4 s(2n\u22123) , but the necessary\n2\u2212n\n1\u2212n\n. Thus we encounter a need\nand SD \u223c\ncondition (n \u2212 1, s) = 1 forces n to be even, making \u03a3D \u223c\n= \u03c4D\n= \u03c4D\nto describe precisely how the degree-2 automorphism \u03c1 of D commutes with \u03a3D and SD \u2013 a task which we\ndo not pursue here. The same problem occurs for the triangulated categories with AR-quivers of the form\nZD4 /h\u03c1\u03c4 m i where \u03c1 is a degree-3 automorphism of ZD4 . We can however use Theorem 9.5 to obtain the\nperiods of algebras of type (Dn , s, 2) when s is even and n is odd (Cf. Proposition 7.3).\nProposition 9.7. Let \u039b be a representation-finite self-injective algebra of type (Dn , s, 2) with n odd and\ns \u2265 2 even. Then the period of \u039b is\n( s(2n\u22123)\ns+n\u22121\n(s,n\u22121) , if char(k) = 2 and 2 | (s,n\u22121)\np\u039b =\n2s(2n\u22123)\n(s,n\u22121) , otherwise.\nProof. Since the AR-quiver of \u039b has shape ZDn /h\u03c1\u03c4 s(2n\u22123) i, we can realize mod-\u039b as the orbit category D/F\ns(2n\u22123)\n2\u2212n\n1\u2212n\n(for\nand SD \u223c\n. The identities \u03a3D \u223c\nwhere D is a skeleton of Db (mod-kDn ) and F = \u03c1\u03c4D\n= \u03c1\u03c4D\n= \u03c1\u03c4D\nn\u2212s\u22121 \u2212s\u2212n+2\ns+n\u22122 \u223c\nn odd) imply that we can take F = SD\n\u03a3D\n. By Theorem 9.5, we now have \u03a3\n= \u2206(\u22121)S n\u2212s\u22121\n2(2\u2212n) \u223c 2(1\u2212n)\nfor the Serre functor S and suspension \u03a3 of mod-\u039b. As in the previous proof, the identity \u03a3D\n= SD\n2(2\u2212n) \u223c 2(1\u2212n)\non the orbit category. Setting\ncan be carried down to an isomorphism \u03a3\n=S\na :=\n\nn\u2212s\u22121\n2(1 \u2212 n)\nand b :=\n(n \u2212 s \u2212 1, 2(n \u2212 1))\n(n \u2212 s \u2212 1, 2(n \u2212 1))\n\n(with the convention that the g.c.d (x, y) of two integers is always positive), we obtain\n\u03a32(n\u22122)a+(s+n\u22122)b = (\u03a32(2\u2212n) )\u2212a (\u03a3s+n\u22122 )b \u223c\n= (S 2(1\u2212n) )\u2212a (\u2206(\u22121)S n\u2212s\u22121 )b = \u2206(\u22121)b .\nSimplifying the exponent of \u03a3 we obtain\n\u03a3\n\n2s(2n\u22123)\n(n\u22121\u2212s,2(n\u22121))\n\n\u223c\n= \u2206(\u22121)\n\n2(n\u22121)/(n\u2212s\u22121,2(n\u22121))\n\n=\n\n(\n\n1mod-\u039b , if 2 \u2224\n\u2206(\u22121),\n\nif 2 |\n\ns+n\u22121\n(s,n\u22121)\ns+n\u22121\n(s,n\u22121) .\n\nNotice that in the first case we have (n \u2212 1 \u2212 s, 2(n \u2212 1)) = (n \u2212 1 \u2212 s, n \u2212 1) = (s, n \u2212 1), while in the second\ncase (n \u2212 1 \u2212 s, 2(n \u2212 1)) = 2(s, n \u2212 1). Since \u2206(\u22121) \u223c\n= 1mod-\u039b if and only if char(k) = 2, the stated periods\nfor \u039b now follow. \u0003\nFinally, we determine the periods of the remaining representation-finite self-injective algebras of type\n(E6 , s, 2) (Cf. Proposition 7.4).\nProposition 9.8.

Using these identities we find that\n(\n1mod-\u039b , if s \u2261 0 (mod 4)\n12/(12,s\u22126)\n22s/(12,s\u22126) \u223c\n=\n\u03a3\n= \u2206(\u22121)\n\u2206(\u22121), if s \u2261 2 (mod 4).\nNotice that in the first case we have (12, s \u2212 6) = (s, 6), while in the second case (12, s \u2212 6) = 2(s, 6). Since\n\u2206(\u22121) \u223c\n= 1mod-\u039b if and only if char(k) = 2, the stated periods for \u039b now follow. \u0003\nFinally, we conclude with a brief list of the remaining open cases.\n\u2022 The periods of algebras of type (Dn , s, 2) with n and s even. By [17] the period is either 2s(2n \u2212\n3)/(s, n \u2212 1) or 4s(2n \u2212 3)/(s, n \u2212 1).\n\u2022 The Calabi-Yau dimensions of algebras of type (Dn , s, 2) with n and s even. By 7.2, if mod-\u039b is\nd-Calabi-Yau then (s, n \u2212 1) = 1 and d \u2261 1 \u2212 (n \u2212 1)\u22121 (mod 2s(2n \u2212 3)).\n\u2022 The periods of algebras of type (D4 , s, 3) when 3|s. By [17] the period is either 5s or 15s in characteristic 2 and either 10s/(s, 2) or 30s/(s, 2) otherwise.\nReferences\n[1] C. Amiot.
