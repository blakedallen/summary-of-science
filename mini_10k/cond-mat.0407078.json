I. Kuznetsov\u2217 and V. A. Tulin\nInstitute of Microelectronics Technology and High Purity Materials,\nRussian Academy of Sciences, 142432 Chernogolovka, Moskow Region, Russia\n(Dated: November 10, 2018)\nThe appearance of phase-slip lines, induced by an rf field, was observed experimentally in wide\nsuperconducting films in which the destruction of superconductivity by a dc current is associated\nwith the formation of phase-slip lines. The characteristics of the separation of the film into superconducting and nonuniform, isothermal, nonequilibrium regions (phase-slip lines) under electromagnetic\nirradiation were studied.\nPACS numbers: 74.40.+k, 74.25.Qt, 74.78.Db, 74.78.-w, 74.50.+r\n\n1. When a current exceeding the critical current\n(I > Ic ) flows through a thin superconducting film at\ntemperatures close to the critical temperature (T < Tc ),\nphase separation of the film into superconducting and\nspatially localized, nonequilibrium regions is possible.\nIn narrow films whose width is less than the coherence\nlength [w < \u03be(T )], these regions, in which the modulus\n|\u2206| of the order parameter of the superconductor periodically vanishes and the phase of the order parameter\nchanges by 2\u03c0n (n is an integer), are called phase-slip\ncenters (PSC) [1]. At temperatures close to Tc and with\ngood heat transfer, wide films [w > \u03be(T )] can form nearly\nisothermal, nonequilibrium, nonuniform regions (phaseslip lines), whose length 2 lE is equal to twice the penetration depth of a longitudinal electric field into the superconductor.\nThe appearance of phase-slip centers has been studied\nextensively [1]. The main experimental studies of phaseslip lines (PSL) are presented in Ref. [2]. We know of\nonly one theoretical work on the formation of PSL during the passage of a dc current through a film [3]. The\ndiscovery of \"nitrogen\" superconductors has renewed interest in the development of devices that operate on the\nbasis of the switching from the superconducting state to\nthe resistive state. The formation of PSL is a possible realization of the resistive state. In wide films there exist,\nbesides PSL, magnetic flux lines. The motion of flux lines\ncan influence the dynamics of PSL and the PSL themselves can influence the dynamics of the flux lines [4].\nThe experimental investigations of PSL performed thus\nfar do not completely explain the physics of such lines.\nIt follows from Refs. [2, 5, 6] that PSL in wide films\nare similar to PSC in narrow films. The I-V characteristics of samples containing PSL have a step character and\nconsist of a series of linear sections, whose resistance is a\nmultiple of the resistance of a single PSL, i.e., R \u2243 nR0 .\nThe resistance to current flow of a single PSL (just as a\nPSC) is R0 = 2\u03c1n lE /wd [1, 2], where \u03c1n , is the normalstate resistivity of the film, and d is the thickness of the\nfilm.\nThe penetration depth of an electric field is deter-\n\nmined by different mechanisms of the relaxation of the\nunbalance of the populations of the electron- and holelike branches of the quasiparticle spectrum of the superconductor. In theoretical studies these mechanisms for\nPSC were investigated in, for example, Refs. [7, 8]. In\nRefs. [5, 6] the cases in which both branches of the spectrum are mixed as a result of inelastic electron-phonon\ncollisions and the so-called elastic mechanism, which is\nthe dominant mechanism when the condensate current is\nsufficiently strong, were studied experimentally in wide\nfilms. The investigation of the temperature dependence\nof the PSL resistance makes it possible to determine\nwhich mechanism of hole-electron conversion leads to the\nappearance of a nonuniform electric field in the superconductor plays the main role. The dynamics of PSL in\nwide films irradiated with high-frequency radiation has\nstill not been studied experimentally. Our objective was\nto conduct such a study.\n2. The samples consisted of tin films of width w = 70\n\u03bcm, thickness d \u2248 1000 \u00c5, and length L = 2 mm. The\nfilms were thermally deposited on polished silicon substrates. A sample was placed in an 8-mm waveguide.\nThe plane of the substrate was parallel to the electric\ncomponent of the 30 GHz electromagnetic field. The dc\nI-V characteristics of the sample were recorded at temperatures close to the critical temperature with different\nirradiation power levels. We note that in tuning the radiation generator the maximum output power Pmax was\nchanged in each new series of measurements. We calculated the resistance of a PSL according to the slope of the\nfirst visible (sometimes second and third) linear section\nof the I-V characteristic which was close to the critical\ncurrent.\n3. To determine the mechanism of the penetration of\na nonuniform longitudinal field into a superconducting\nfilm, we investigated the temperature dependence of the\nresistance of the first phase-slip line with no irradiation.\nThis dependence was nonmonotonic, just as in [5] for\nphase-slip lines and in [9] for phase-slip centers. In the\nisothermal region, the resistance was determined by the\n\n\f2\n\n40\n\n6\n\n30\n\n4\n0\n\n5\n\n0.25\n\n20\n\nR (\n\n0.20\n\n2\n2\n\n1\n\n0.15\n\n10\n\nV (\n\n3\n\nV)\n\n15\n\n4\n\n0.10\n0.00\n\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n60\nI (\n\nP / P\n\nA )\n\n40\n\n60\n\nA )\n\nFIG. 1: Initial sections of the I-V characteristic with irradiation power in the range of suppression of the critical current\nand increase in the resistance of the first linear section from\nR0 to \u2248 2R0 .

For our films, the penetration of\nthe longitudinal electric field in the isothermal region is\ntherefore associated mainly with the inelastic electronphonon mechanism of balancing of the populations of the\nelectron-like and hole-like branches.\n4. Similar results were obtained for different films in\nall series of measurements. For this reason, only the characteristic and most detailed dependences from different\nseries are shown in the figures. Figure 1 shows the I-V\ncharacteristic of one sample as a function of the irradiation power at a temperature close to Tc . The I-V characteristic of the unirradiated sample, including two steps,\nis shown in the inset in Fig. 1. As the power increases,\nat first the critical current can increase. This could be\nassociated with the stimulation of superconductivity [10].\n\nm a x\n\nFIG. 2: Normalized resistance of the first visible PSL step\nnear I = 0 as a function of the relative irradiation power.\nT \u2248 3.88 K, R0 \u2248 0.12 \u03a9, Pc /Pmax \u2248 0.01.

Solid line: R = R0 + b(P/Pmax \u2212 Pc /Pmax )1/2 , where\nb \u2248 0.4 \u03a9. This power dependence was measured in the new\nseries of measurements, so that the value of Pmax is different.\n\nIt is not represented in Fig. 1. At some power (\u2248 \u221224\ndB ) the critical current is appreciably suppressed and\nvanishes in an interval of several dB. We call the power\nPc at which Ic = 0 the critical power. The resistance R0\nremains virtually constant at a power lower than Pc . The\ninitial section of the I-V characteristic for P > Pc is linear\nand there is virtually no hysteresis in the I-V characteristic recorded in both directions. Despite the absence of\na critical current, the step structure of the I-V characteristic remains up to the irradiation power at which the\nresistance of the film is equal to the normal-state resistance of the whole film. Similar I-V characteristics were\nalso observed with no stimulation of superconductivity.\n5. Figure 2 shows the normalized resistance R/R0 as a\nfunction of the relative irradiation power P/Pmax , where\nR is the resistance of the first, linear section, which is\nclose to the critical current, of the I-V characteristic. The\nresistance R0 is the resistance of a single PSL with no\nirradiation. In the case of no critical current the resistance was determined near a current close to zero. The\nmeasurements were performed in the temperature range\nwhere dc overheating phenomena are weak, i.e., in the\nisothermal region. As the power increases, the normalized resistance increases, mainly by a jump, and after the\njump it equals an integer. The small nonuniqueness of\nthe dependence is explained by the fact that in repeated\nmeasurements there was a scatter in the powers at which\na jump onto the nth step occurred. Moreover, at some\npowers the probabilities of states with the n and (n + m)\n\n\f3\n\nR = b(P/Pmax \u2212 Pc /Pmax )k + R0 ,\n\n0.6\n\nc\n\n/ P\n\nm a x\n\n0.4\n\nP\n\nPSL, where n and m are integers, were close. The sample jumped from one state into another. Separate points\ncorresponding to the second or third visible linear step\nare also shown in Fig. 2. In some power intervals the\nresistance of the first, close to zero, step increased continuously, and then made a more or less distinct jump\nto a state with n PSL. We constructed the experimental curve of the resistance versus P/Pmax in the interval\nwhere the resistance increases continuously from R0 up\nto values \u2264 2R0 for one of the samples (Fig. 2, inset).\nThese data can be approximated by a root function\n\n0.2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere k \u2248 0.5, and b is a constant. Such dependences\nwere also obtained for other films.\n6. A phase separation into superconducting and\nnonequilibrium regions (PSL), which is induced by highfrequency irradiation, has thus been observed for the\nfirst time in wide superconducting films. The \"highfrequency\" separation is similar to the \"current\" separation. The possibility of \"high-frequency\" separation\nwhen superconductivity is stimulated in narrow channels\nwas described in Ref. [11]. To clarify the physical picture of the process and to compare it with the theory\nof Ref. [11] and the experiment of Ref. [12] for narrow films, where PSC are formed, we constructed the\ntemperature dependence of the relative critical power\nPc /Pmax (T ). Near Tc this dependence has the form\nPc /Pmax \u223c (1 \u2212 T /Tc)3/2 (Fig. 3). However, it is close to\na linear dependence at temperatures farther away from\nthe critical temperature and for somewhat higher powers. In this case the isothermal state could be disrupted.\nThe temperature dependence Pc /Pmax \u223c (1 \u2212 T /Tc )3/2\nagrees with the following experimental results: 1) The\ncritical current Ic (0) with no irradiation and the critical\npower Pc /Pmax have the same temperature dependence\nnear Tc and 2) the critical current Ic (P/Pmax ) with irradiation is roughly a linear function of the power near Tc\nand P close to Pc .\nAt a temperature very close to Tc and low power,\nhowever, this dependence had the form Ic (P/Pmax ) =\nIc (0) \u2212 c(P/Pmax )1/2 , where c is a constant. In Ref. [13]\nthe power dependence Ic (P/Pmax ) at low power was close\nto quadratic. Instabilities of different nature which result\nin the destruction of superconductivity have a different\ntemperature dependence of the critical power. In Ref.\n[11] the relative critical power of the high-frequency separation of a film under conditions of stimulation of superconductivity in narrow films is proportional to 1 \u2212 T /Tc.\nIn the case of an instability as a result of the pairbreaking current Pc \u223c (1 \u2212 T /Tc )3 , for flux-line motion Pc \u223c (1 \u2212 T /Tc )2 , and in a strong parallel field\nPc \u223c 1 \u2212 T /Tc [14]. In Ref. [13] Pc \u223c 1 \u2212 T /Tc for a\nthin film with a transport current and microwave irradiation, disregarding transparency. Very close to Tc other\ntemperature dependences of Pc can be expected because\n\n0.0\n3.84\n\n3.86\n\n3.88\n\n3.90\n\nT ( K )\n\nFIG. 3: Temperature dependence of the relative critical\npower at temperatures close to the critical temperature; Tc \u2248\n3.91 K. Solid line: Pc /Pmax = h(1\u2212T /Tc )3/2 , where h \u2248 300.\n\nof the nonequilibrium nature of the gap. The theories\nof Refs. [11, 13] are concerned with uniform films which\ntransform at the critical irradiation power Pc into the\nnormal state [13] or into a nonuniform state with phase\nseparation into PSC, the nonequilibrium regions immediately filling the sample along its entire length with a\ndefinite period [11]. In our case, just as in Ref. [12], the\nnumber of PSL which are formed on the nonuniformities of the film increases systematically with increasing\nirradiation power above Pc . However, the temperature\ndependence Pc (T ) is different from the dependences presented in Refs. [11, 12, 13, 14].\n7. There are several differences:\n1) The transition from the power at which the critical current is first suppressed to the power at which the\naverage critical current Ic = 0 is extended and its width\nis \u2248 5 dB (Fig. 1), while in Ref. [12] the width of this\ntransition is \u2248 0.5 dB. The transition region depends on\nthe absolute irradiation power and can be large for other\nmeasurements.\n2) The resistance of a single PSL R0 \u223c lE most likely\ndoes not change with an increase in power at the irradiation frequency 30 GHz, and the resistance R at the first\nstep of the I-V characteristic of a sample with a PSL increases as a result of the appearance of new PSL. In Ref.\n[12] the resistance R0 of the irradiated sample decreased\nby 30 % . It follows from the power-independence of R0\nthat the temperature dependence of R0 is also not related to the high-frequency irradiation at this frequency.\nIrradiation thus has no effect on the realization of the\ninelastic mechanism of relaxation of the unbalance of the\npopulations of the electron- and hole-like branches of the\nquasiparticle spectrum.\n3) In addition to a discrete increase of the resistance as\n\n\f4\na function of the power, there are also regions where R\nincreases continuously (Fig. 2, inset). The increase of the\nresistance from R0 up to values \u2248 2R0 can be explained\nby a gradual appearance of a second PSL. This process is\nassociated with the production of Abrikosov flux lines by\nan rf magnetic field. The motion of these flux lines under\nthe action of the measuring current gives an additional\ncontribution to R. The experimental power dependence\nof this contribution has the form\n1/2\n\nRf low = R \u2212 R0 = b(P/Pmax \u2212 Pc /Pmax )\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere b is a constant. The power Pc at which the critical current vanishes is most likely equal to the power\nat which the flux lines start to move. The motion of\nthe flux lines produced by the rf electromagnetic field\nprobably terminates with the formation of another PSL.\nHowever, many subsequent PSLs are formed by a jump\nwithout the participation of flux lines. Suppression of the\norder parameter could be another cause of the continuous\ngrowth of R. In this case Ref. [15]\n2\n\n\u03b4R = R \u2212 R0 \u223c \u03b4lE \u223c \u03b4\u2206/\u2206 \u223c A\u03c9 \u223c P,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere A\u03c9 is the average amplitude of the magnetic vector\npotential of the electromagnetic field. According to our\nideas, we worked at lower powers. Measurements with no\nirradiation were performed in the interval of isothermality of PSL. Hysteresis also did not occur at low irradiation\npowers, so that the continuous growth of the resistance\nfrom R0 up to \u2248 2R0 on the first linear section is most\nlikely not associated with thermal superheating.\n8. In summary, phase separation, induced by an rf field\nwith power above the critical power Pc , on phase-slip\nlines was observed in wide superconducting films. Near\nthe critical temperature the power is Pc \u223c (1 \u2212 T /Tc)3/2 .\nAs the power increases, the resistance of the film increases, on the whole, by an amount that is a multiple of\nthe resistance R0 of a single PSL with no irradiation, and\nthis increase is associated with the successive formation\nof new PSLs. The resistance R0 and therefore the timeaveraged value of the penetration depth of a longitudinal\n\nelectric field do not depend on the irradiation power at\n30 GHz. There is an additional contribution to the resistance of the sample \u03b4R \u223c (P/Pmax \u2212 Pc /Pmax )1/2 which\ncould be associated with the motion of flux lines in an rf\nfield.\n\n\u2217\nElectronic address:kvi@ipmt-hpm.ac.ru\n[1] B.
