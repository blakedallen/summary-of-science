In the instanton field the parton Wilson lines involve multi-gluon exchange as depicted in Fig. 1, with no\nneed for initial and final state multi-gluon resummation.\nOur analysis has shown that the cross section for \"quasielastic\" (color-transfer) parton-parton\nand dipole-dipole\n\u221a\nscattering is constant at large s.\nIn this paper we extend our original analysis to\n\"truly inelastic\" parton-parton scattering amplitudes,\nwith prompt parton production. Such partonic processes have new particle lines crossing the unitarity cut\nas shown in the lower-left part of Fig. 1. Similar processes have been studied in the early 90's, in the context\nof baryon-number violation in the electroweak theory [5].\nIn the latter it was shown that multiple gluon production can also be calculated semi-classically, through interacting instanton-antiinstanton configurations or streamlines [13] which interpolate between a well separated\ninstanton-antiinstanton and the vacuum. By combining\nthe semi-classical treatment of multiple incoming gluons,\nas done in [6], with the stream-line-based treatment of\nmultiple outgoing gluons, we can completely bypass the\nperturbative expansion, as indicated in the lower-right\npart of Fig. 1. Contacts with perturbation theory follow\nby expanding the instanton contributions in powers of\nthe field in the weak-field limit.\nIn this paper we will not develop a quantitative theory\nof hadronic collisions (as that require further modeling)\nand consider only the basic process involving inelastic\nquark-quark scattering. For clarity, it is important that\nthe underlying assumptions in our analysis be spelled out\nfrom the onset. Throughout, the scattering processes are\nunderstood to undergo three sequential stages:\ni. initial stage: Partons are initially described by\nsome wave-function in a fixed frame (say the CM), depending on their transverse momenta and rapidities 1 .\nThe through-going partons should be formed outside of\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nQCD instantons [1,2] play an important role in the\ncomposition of the vacuum and its hadronic excitations [3]. This viewpoint is strongly supported by detailed lattice simulations [3]. Naturally most hadronic\nsubstructure, whether in the form of constituent quarks\nor gluons, should also be important for hadronic reactions at high energies. The problem in translating vacuum physics to high energy scattering has been strongly\nlimited by technical issues, an important one being the\nEuclidean nature of instanton physics and the inherent\nlight-cone character of high-energy kinematics. As a result, the theory of high energy processes remains mostly\nperturbative, as best illustrated by the BFKL ladder resummation [4] in the hard regime, with exchange momenta much larger than 1 GeV.\nThis not withstanding, a rich pomeron phenomenology\nhas been developed prior and through QCD. We will not\nbe able to render justice here to all relevant papers. Particularly important for us is the formulation based on the\neikonal expansion for the high energy parton-parton cross\nsection, originally suggested by Nachtmann [7]. Similar\nexpressions for structure functions were also suggested\nby Muller [8]. Ideas using instanton effects for high\nenergy QCD processes were also recently discussed, for\ndipole cross sections in [9], and the soft pomeron problem\nin [10,11] (KKL).\nRecently, we have suggested a non-perturbative approach to high energy scattering using instantons [6].\nThe eikonalized near-forward parton-parton scattering\namplitude was reduced to a pertinent correlation function\nof two (or more) straight Wilson lines, which were analyzed in Euclidean space using instantons. The lines at\nan arbitrary angle \u03b8, which is then analytically continued\nto Minkowski space by the trick y = \u2212i\u03b8 where y is the\nMinkowski rapidity. A similar construction was applied\nrecently to nonperturbative parton-parton scattering in\nsupersymmetric theories using the AdS/CFT correspondence [12], where on the boundary large N instantons\nare expected to saturate exactly the diffractive cross section. (Incidentally, most of the arguments to follow can\nbe checked exactly in these theories using instanton cal-\n\n1\n\nThe parton model is of course frame and scale specific: partons which belong to a wave function of one colliding hadron\nin a given frame, can belong to another hadron wave function\nin another frame. The normalization scale is basically given\nby the inverse instanton size.\n\n1\n\n\f\u221a\n2\nthe instanton of mean size \u03c10 with k\u22a5\n/ s \u2264 1/\u03c10 , while\nthe wee partons (the opposite condition) are not in the\nwave function but included in the cross section. The formers are assumed to move along the eikonalized straight\nWilson lines, while the latters are part of the process.\nii. prompt stage: In it the incoming partons pass\neach other. Color of through-going partons could be\nchanged (quasi-elastic), or new partons/hadrons could\nappear (inelastic). In analogy with the perturbative\ntreatment, confinement is ignored\u221a\nat this stage, since the\npassage time is short (of order 1/ s). All partons interact with instantons.\niii. final stage: In it all produced partons fly away,\nsome dragging longitudinal color strings of matching\ncolor. String breaking happens with probability one, thus\ncross sections are not affected. These eventually produce\nthe physical final states with multiple hadrons.\nAll partonic amplitudes to be assessed, will take place in\nthe prompt regime. We assume that by duality, the total\npartonic cross sections match the hadronic cross sections.\nIn section 2, we give an overview of the salient physical\npoints of this work. In section 3, we give a brief account\nof the instanton-induced quasi-elastic (color-transfer),\nparton-parton scattering amplitude as reported in [6].\nWe also report on novel issues regarding the character\nof the weak-field limit in light of perturbation theory,\nas well as the absence of odderons in instanton-induced\nprocesses. In section 4 we argue that the full inelastic\ncontribution to the parton-parton scattering amplitude\nfollows semi-classically from the QCD streamline configuration. The result is a remarkable enhancement in the\ninelastic scattering amplitude, limited only by the unitarity bound. In section 5 we show that a statistical\nresummation of the enhanced pair cross sections yield a\nreggeized hadron-hadron scattering cross section. The\npomeron intercept and slope are sensitive to the QCD\nvacuum parameters, and as it turns out, even to the instanton shapes. In section 6 we draw a parallel between\nthe Weizsacker-Williams approximation to inelastic scattering and the weak field limit of the semi-classical analysis, and discuss which instanton-induced form-factors are\nthe pertinent ones. In section 7 we discuss additional contributions to the diffractive process not retained in our\nanalysis. Our conclusions and outlook are summarized\nin section 8.\n\nnon-perturbative boundary in perturbation theory, and\neven makes meaningful predictions a little beyond it [3].\nAlthough in QCD instanton-induced effects have a small\nappearance probability (density) n0 \u2248 e\u22122\u03c0/\u03b1s , they correspond to strong (classical) fields A \u2248 1/g. Hence, any\ninteraction with a parton of charge g is gA \u2248 1 which is\nindependent of the charge. In contrast to perturbation\ntheory, there is no additional penalty for adding partons\nto the amplitude. Therefore, the instanton-induced amplitudes overcome the perturbative amplitudes at high\nenough order. Indeed, recently we have suggested [6]\nthat instantons would dominate collisions with multiple\ncolor exchanges between partons, leading to the higher\nobserved hadronic multiplicities.\n\n00111100\n11001100\n\n111\n000\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n\n00111100\n1100\n\n1111\n0000\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n\n111111\n000000\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n\n1111\n0000\n000\n111\n1010 111\n000\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n000\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n1010 111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n00000000000\n11111111111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n00000000000\n11111111111\n00000000000\n11111111111\n00000000000\n11111111111\n00000000000\n11111111111\n11001100 10 11001100\n1100 1010 11001100\n\n0000000\n111111\n000000\n1111111\n111111\n000000\n\n0000000\n1111111\n1111111\n0000000\n0000000\n1111111\n0000000\n1111111\n0000000\n1111111\n0000000\n1111111\n0000000\n1111111\n0000000\n1111111\n0000000\n1111111\n0000000\n1111111\n0000000\n1111111\n0000000\n1111111\n\n1010\n1111111111\n0000000000\n0000000000\n1111111111\n0000000000\n1111111111\n0000000000\n1111111111\n0000000000\n1111111111\n\nquasi-elastic\n0000\n1111\n10 101111\n0000\n0000\n1111\n11001100 11001100\n0000\n1111\n0000\n0000\n1111\n0000000\n1111111\n0000000\n1111111\n00001010 10101111\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n1100 1100 11111\n0000000\n1111111\n1111111111111\n0000000000000\n00000\n1111111\n0000000000\n1111111111\n0000000\n1111111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000000\n1111111\n00000 0000000\n11111\n0000000000\n1111111\n0000000\n0000000\n1111111\n0000000\n1111111\n11111111111111111111\n0000000000\n0000000000\n1111111111\n0000000\n1111111\n0000000\n1111111\n00000\n11111\n0000000000\n1111111111\n0000000\n1111111\n0000000\n1111111\n00000\n110011001010 1100 11111\n0000000000\n1111111111\n00000\n0000000\n1111111\n11001100 1010 1100110011111\n00000\n11111\n1100110010 11001100\n00000\n1100 1010 1100110011111\n\n11111111111\n00000000000\n00000000000\n11111111111\n00000000000\n11111111111\n00000000000\n11111111111\n00000000000\n11111111111\n\n11111\n00000\n00000\n11111\n00000\n11111\n00000\n11111\n00000\n11111\n00000\n11111\n00000\n11111\n00000\n11111\n00000\n11111\n00000\n11111\n\ninelastic\nFIG. 1.\nSchematic representation of the amplitude\nsquared, with (without) gluon lines are shown in the left\n(right) side of the figure. The dotted vertical line is the unitarity cut. The upper panel illustrates the quasi-elastic (at\nthe parton level) amplitudes where only color is exchanged as\ndetailed in [6]. The lower panel depicts inelastic processes in\nwhich some gluons cross the unitarity cut, and some gluons\nare absorbed in the initial stage.\n\nThe important question regarding the transition from\nthe perturbative regime to the instanton dominated\n(semiclassical) regime in parton-parton collisions, depends critically on the numerical parameters characterizing the QCD vacuum. There are essentially two key\nparameters [14] (see also [6] for some details). The instanton (plus anti-instanton) density n0 \u2248 1 /fm4 and the\nmean instanton size \u03c10 \u2248 1/3 fm yield the dimensionless\ndiluteness \u03ba0 = n0 \u03c140 \u2248 0.01 of the instanton vacuum 2 .\nThe mean instanton action is S0 = 2\u03c0/\u03b1s \u2248 10 \u2212 15.\nEach time an instanton is inserted it costs a small factor \u03ba0 . However, there are no coupling constants, and so\n\nII. PHYSICAL HIGHLIGHTS\n\nThe ubiquitous character of the instantons in the nonperturbative QCD vacuum, as now established both theoretically and numerically, leads naturally to their importance in partonic scattering during the collision time\n(prompt stage). In particular, instantons prove essential for discriminating perturbative from nonperturbative effects. Indeed, whenever instanton effects are included (even in lowest order) one can often locate the\n\n2\nFor comparison we note that in the electroweak theory the\ndiluteness factor is 10\u221284 despite the fact that the coupling is\nonly three times smaller than in QCD.\n\n2\n\n\feach time we compare the results with their perturbative\ncounterparts we get powers of the large action S0 , with a\nnet gain per gluon involved. Numerically the instantoninduced effects should dominate the perturbative effects\nfrom third order and on (\u03ba0 S02 \u2248 1), while they comparable to second order. Of course this argument is too\nnaive, there maybe other factors and so on, but we believe\nthe argument captures the main reason why instantoninduced processes dominate the inelastic parton-parton\ncross sections.\nThe quasi-elastic (QE) parton-parton scattering cross\nsection [6], produces a cross section of order\n\u03c3QE \u2248 \u03c0\u03c120 \u03ba20 ,\n\ntechnically attributed to a moving saddle point, reducing the relative distance between an instanton and its\nconjugate antiinstanton, thereby decreasing their initial\naction of 2S0 . Reliable calculation can be carried out\nin this region. The increase in the inelastic amplitude\nis stopped by unitarity constraints, as suggested by Zakharov [15], precisely when the total instanton action is\nreduced from 2S0 to S0 . The specifics of the unitarization\nprocess to be discussed below will follow on the qualitative arguments suggested by Maggiore and Shifman [16].\nAside from technicalities, the physical meaning of their\narguments is simple: if there is enough energy for the\nsystem to reach the top of the barrier (the sphaleron),\nits consecutive decay follows with unit probability. All\nwhat is needed is that the \"wee partons\" (the field of\nthe through-moving hard partons) can encounter an instanton and deposit about 2 GeV of invariant mass. The\ntunneling probability at low energy on the other hand\ncan be considered as a product of the amplitude to get\non and off the barrier: hence the instanton amplitude\nappears twice. In QCD this enhancement of the inelastic processes with multi-gluon production amounts to the\ngain \u03ba20 \u2192 \u03ba0 which is an enhancement by a factor of the\norder of a 100 in the inelastic cross section relative to the\nquasi-elastic one 5 .\nAlthough we do not use the concept of t-channel gluon\nexchanges (as they are summed into the eikonalized\nphases), some of its features remarkably survive. Already\nin the quasi-elastic process only the octet color exchange\nsurvives the high-energy limit [6]. The same feature carries over to the inelastic processes we now consider where\nonly the octet color is transmitted from each parton line.\nOf course they should be in the same SU(2) subgroup\nto interact with a given instanton. In general, these restrictions on the possible color representations disagree\nwith the exponentiation of multi-gluon production, leading to the semiclassical theory we use. In a way, this\nresembles the trade between using canonical as opposed\nto micro-canonical (more accurate) ensemble in statistical mechanics. Presumably our assessment of the total\ncross section is still good, since the number of produced\ngluons is large, Ng \u2248 S0 \u2248 10 \u2212 15.\nThe questions regarding the \"sphaleron decay modes\"\n(their decomposition into various channels) will be discussed elsewhere. We note that in recent phenomenological studies [10,9] of high-energy scattering only colorless\nchannels (the rangs of ladders) were considered, e.g. 0++\n(scalar glueball) and \u03c0\u03c0 (scalar). Although these states\nmay contribute to the \"sphaleron decay modes\", especially in light of the closeness of the 0++ mass to the\n\n(1)\n\nwhich is small in comparison to the one-gluon exchange\n(OGE) result at the same scale3\n\u03c3OGE \u2248 \u03c0\u03c12\u2217 (\u03b1s /\u03c0)2 .\n\n(2)\n\nBelow, we show that the instanton-induced partonparton inelastic cross section is significantly enhanced\n\u03c3 \u2248 \u03c0\u03c120 \u03ba0 ,\n\n(3)\n\nby one power of the diluteness factor \u03ba0 , even though it\nproduces about S0 \u2248 10 \u2212 15 gluons. The perturbative\ncontributions to the inelastic cross section are suppressed.\nIndeed, a one-gluon production yields 4\n\u03c3gg\u2192ggg \u2248 \u03c0 \u03c12\u2217 (\u03b1s /\u03c0)3 .\n\n(4)\n\nAs a result, the instanton-induced effects dominate the\nperturbative contributions in the growing part of the inelastic cross section.\nThe distribution over the invariant mass Q of the produced gluons, deposited by the wee incoming partons\nonto the instanton, will be calculated in a specific unitarization model. In the weak field limit the growth in\nthe inelastic cross section gg \u2192 any is captured by the\n\"holy-grail function\"\n\u03c3gg\u2192any (Q) \u2248 eF (Q/Qs ) ,\n\n(5)\n\nstudied in the baryon number violating processes in\nthe standard model [5]. It peaks around the so called\nsphaleron energy, which in QCD is given by the mean\ninstanton size \u03c10\nEs = Qs /\u03c10 \u2248 3\u03c0/(4\u03c10 \u03b1s ) \u2248 2 GeV ,\n\n(6)\n\nfor \u03c10 \u2248 1/3 fm and \u03b1s \u2248 1/2. Below this sphaleron energy the cross section is small but rapidly growing. As\nshown by Khoze and Ringwald [5], this growth can be\n\n5\n\nThe analogous electroweak instanton-induced cross section\nis increased by about 85 orders of magnitude due to the same\nenhancement: but it still remains far below any observable\nrate because one power of small diluteness is there.\n\n\u221a\nThe infrared sensitivity in OGE is cutoff by 1/ \u2212t \u2248 \u03c1\u2217 .\n4\nBoth the instanton-induced and perturbative amplitudes\nyield ln s enhancements that are summed.\n3\n\n3\n\n\fwhere\n\nsphaleron energy (6), we expect on general grounds additional contributions involving colored states as well.\nFinally, we will show how the logarithmic growth in\nthe instanton-induced parton-parton scattering amplitude takes place. Empirically, the growth is fitted at\nabout s \u2248 100 GeV2 . In this regime, the number of\nthrough-going effective partons can still be considered\nsmall and fixed with qqq for the nucleon and q\u0304q for\nmesons and photons (plus possibly some \"primordial\"\nglue from the QCD strings). At higher energies (although\nwell below the Froissart bound) the power growth takes\nplace, with possibly several effects contributing to it. The\nfirst and the simplest contribution (to be discussed in this\nwork) is that since the elementary cross section grows,\nmore parton-parton interaction takes place. Since the\nhadron size is large compared to that of the instanton\n2\nRH\n/\u03c120 \u2248 10 \u226b 1, we think that double, triple etc parton\ncollisions will take place in a statistically independent\nway (Poisson). A straightforward resummation of the\ncompounded probabilities yields a total hadronic cross\nsection that approximately reggeizes\n2 \u2206(t)\n\u03c3H (s, t) \u2248 \u03c0 RH\ns\n,\n\n\u0012 Z\nW1,2 (b) = Pc exp ig\n\n+\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\nd\u03c4 A(b + v1,2 \u03c4 ) * v1,2\n\n\u0013\n\n.

In a way, we may think of \u2206(t)\nas the square of the instanton-induced form factor. The\nsecond contribution is a re-interaction of one of the produced gluons, leading to instanton ladders as considered\nin KKL [11]. The third and final contribution may stem\nfrom rescattering through the \"primordial\" partons at\nsmall x in the wave function, even at the low normalization point under consideration. These effects are not\nincluded in our \"wee\" partons which are separated in the\ntransverse plane by a distance larger than \u03c10 from all\nothers.\n\nwhere\n\n\u0012 Z\n\u0013\nW(b, \u03b8) = Pc exp ig\nd\u03c4 A(b + v\u03c4 ) * v ,\n\n(12)\n\n\u03b8\n\nwith v = p/m.

QUASI-ELASTIC SCATTERING\n\nIn this section we will recall the quasi-elastic results\nderived in [6]. This will help us streamline the notation\nand facilitate the comparison with the inelastic results\nto follow. We also discuss issues related to instantons\nin the weak-field limit, and show that instanton-induced\nprocesses do not discriminate between C-even and C-odd\neffects in the t-channel, despite their multi-gluon structure.\n\nB.

No Odderon\n\nIn the early model by Low [17] and Nussinov [18],\nthe near-forward high-energy scattering amplitude is described by a perturbative two-gluon exchange in the tchannel, which is C-parity even. Hence the qq and q\u0304q\ncross sections are the same to this order, a result that\nappears to be supported by experiment.\n\u221a Indeed, the difference \u03c3p\u0304p \u2212 \u03c3pp decreases at large s [19].\nHowever perturbation theory also allows for higher order corrections, e.g. SU(3) allows for a colorless combination of 3 gluons. Perturbatively, the odderon/pomeron\nratio is O(\u03b1s ) and not as suppressed as the data shows.\nTo fix this problem, a number of ideas have been put forward some of which relying on nucleon specifics (quarkdiquark structure [20]) to cancel the odderon. If that is\nthe case, the odderon should still be observable in other\nhadronic reactions.\nIn contrast, instanton-induced processes at high energy do not suffer from the drawbacks of higher-order\ncorrections. Indeed, even though our quasi-elastic and\neven inelastic (see below) amplitudes sum up an indefinite number of gluons, switching a quark to antiquark on\nthe external line amounts to flipping the sign of the corresponding sin \u03b1 contribution. As there is no interference\nbetween these and the cos \u03b1 terms at high energy, there\nis no odderon in the instanton induced amplitudes. This\nis easily understood by noting that an instanton is an\nSU(2) instead of an SU(3) field, for which the fundamental (quark) and the adjoint (antiquark) representations\nare equivalent.\n\n(16)\n\nwhere dI is short for the instanton measure\ndI \u2261 d4 z dn dR \u2192 n0 d4 z dR .\n\n(17)\n\nThe second equality holds for fixed instanton density\nn0 = 1/ fm4 and size \u03c10 = 1/3 fm.

Note that only the combination\nR R survives after analytically\n\u221a continuing to Minkowski\nspace and taking the large s limit.\nThe one-instanton contribution to the parton-parton\nscattering amplitude survives only in the color-changing\nchannel a situation reminiscent of one-gluon exchange [6].\nAs a result, the quasi-elastic parton-parton cross section\n\u221a\nreceives a finite two-instanton contribution at large s.\nThe unitarized parton-parton partial differential cross\nsection reads\nd\u03c3\n1 X\nBD\n\u2248 2\nTAC\ndt\ns\n\n2\n\n,\n\n(18)\n\nCD\n\nwith the averaging over the initial colors A, B understood.

Weak Field Limit\n\n(20)\n\nIn the weak-field limit, most of our results [6] simplify\nwith interesting consequences on conventional perturbation theory. Indeed, instanton-induced amplitudes involve integration over the instanton (antiinstanton) center of mass z.

A similar subtraction will\nalso be needed in the inelastic regime (see below).\n\nIV. INELASTIC SCATTERING\n\nTo address inelastic amplitudes with instantons, the\neikonal approximation has to be relaxed. To achieve that\nand elucidate further the character of the s-channel kinematics, we first derive a general result for on-shell quark\npropagation in a localized background field in Minkowski\nspace. We then show how this result can be applied to instanton dynamics to analyze inelastic parton-parton scattering at high energy beyond the eikonal approximation\nand ladder graphs. For simplicity, all the instanton algebra will be carried out explicitly for Nc = 2.\n\n2. gg \u2192 g\n\nIn the weak-field limit the fusion gg \u2192 g is best analyzed in momentum space using the Fourier transform of\n(23),\nAa\u03bc (k) =\n\n\u03c0\u03c120 ab a\nR \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd k\u03bd .\ngk 2\n\nA.

This correlation function follows from\na doubling of the fields, a situation reminiscent of thermofield dynamics.\nTo proceed further, some dynamical approximations\nare needed. Let us assume that the double-functional\nintegral in (36) involves some background field configurations characterized by a set of collective variables (still\nin Minkowski space), say I = Z, R, \u03c1, for position, color\norientation respectively. Let z = Z \u2212 Z \u2032 be the relative\ncollective position. Simple shifts of integrations, produce\n\n\u2032\n\ni\n\ni\n\neiQz = e 2 q1+ z\u2212 + 2 q2\u2212 z+ \u2212i(q1 +q2 )\u22a5 z\u22a5 ,\n\n(37)\n\nwith no dependence on Z, Z \u2032 in the W's. The integration over the location of the CM (Z + Z \u2032 )/2 produces\nV T which cancels the 1/V T in front, due to overall\ntranslational invariance. The integration over the relative coordinate z produces a function of the invariant\nQ2 = q1+ q2\u2212 \u2212 (q1 + q2 )2\u22a5 because of Lorentz invariance.\nWith this observation and to leading logarithm accuracy,\nwe may rewrite (36) as follows\nX 1 Z\n1\ndQ2 dq1\u22a5 dq2\u22a5\n\u03c3 \u2248 lns Im\n4\n(2\u03c0)6\nCD\nZ\n \u0307\n \u0307\u2032\n \u0307 \u2032\n\u2032\n\u00d7 dz dI \u0307 dI \u0307 eiQz+iS(I)\u2212iS(I )+iS(I,\u0130 ,z)\nZ\n\u00d7 dx\u2212 dx\u22a5 dy+ dy\u22a5 e\u2212iq1\u22a5 x\u22a5 \u2212iq2\u22a5 y\u22a5\n\n(35)\n\nThe functional integration is understood over gaugefields (to be saturated by instantons in Euclidean space\nafter proper analytical continuation), with A(k) (A\u2032 (k))\nthe Fourier transform of the pertinent asymptotic of A\n(A\u2032 ) evaluated on mass shell. Similar expressions were\nused for sphaleron-mediated gluon fusion [5]. The difference with the present case is the occurrence of quarks in\nboth the initial, intermediate and final states. The sum in\n(35) exponentiates into the so-called R-term, which acts\nas an induced interaction between the A and A\u2032 configurations in the double functional integral (35).

However, we\nnote that in Minkowski space, the dominant contribution\nwhile continuing in \u03b8 involves RRRR. From here on, it\nwill be the only one retained. With this in mind, we\ncarry first the integration over the collective variable R\nand R\u2032 in the SU(2) case by explicitly carrying part of\nthe group integration. Setting u0 = cos\u03c7, and averaging\nover SU(2) gives\n\n(38)\n\ni\n\nNote that the omitted exponents e 2 q+ x\u2212 etc. are subleading in leading logarithm accuracy. The dotted integrations no longer involve the collective variables Z, Z \u2032 .\nThe only left dependence on the relative variable z resides\nin the induced R-term. The appearance of ln s underlines\nthe fact that the integrand in (38) involves only Q2 which\nis the transferred mass in the inelastic half of the forward\namplitude, and q1,2\u22a5 which are the transferred momenta\nthrough the quark form-factors.\nAll kinematical approximations in this section were\ncarried out in Minkowski space, a point stressed in our\nearlier work [6]. The result is (38) to leading logarithm\naccuracy. This is one of our main result, showing that\nthe inelastic contributions to the forward quark-quark\nscattering amplitude cause the latter to rise with lns, irrespective of the background field used.

Throughout, the\ntail of the instanton will be subtracted resulting into a\nrenormalization of the perturbative result.\n\nD. Streamline\n\nIn the Euclidean regime QE z \u2248 1, the instantonantiinstanton overlaps as their interaction becomes\nstrong. In this case, it is more appropriate to use the\nstreamline configuration, which is a gauge configuration that interpolates between an instanton-antiinstanton\nasymptotically and the vacuum, following the path of\nleast action (valley). A very good parameterization of\nthe streamline follows from conformal symmetry. In particular\n\n.5e2\n\n.1e2\n\nS(z, cos2 \u03c7) = a(z) + b(z) cos2 \u03c7 + c(z) cos4 \u03c7 ,\n\n(51)\n\n5.\n\nwhere a(z), b(z) and c(z) are known functions of z [13].\nUsing (51) in the saddle point approximation carried\nabove, allows for a better assessment of the Q2 -integrand\nin (49).

The\nstreamline configuration allows us to extend the validity\nof the dipole approximation to higher Q2 , through the\nholy-grail function F . The specific form of F will not be\nneeded if unitarization takes place as we now show.\n\nFIG. 2.\nThe induced instanton form-factor |J(q\u22a5 )|\n(points) and its parameterization (48) (solid line) versus\nq1 = q\u22a5 \u03c10 . The four set of points (counting from top to\nbottom) correspond to different parameterizations of the instanton shape (see section VC below) a = 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75\n(top to bottom).\n\nE. Multi-instantons and Unitarization\n\nThe imaginary part of (46) is readily assessed in the\ndipole approximation by retaining only the first contribution in (40). Carrying the R and \u03b3 integrations by saddle point we obtain a purely imaginary result to leading\norder owing to the unstable mode around the instantonantiinstanton configuration.

This conclusion is physically\nincorrect.\nIndeed, in the analogous problem of baryon number\nviolation in the standard model, Zakharov [15] has argued that for Q \u2248 Qs the rise in the cross section\n9\n\n\fhas to stop because of unitarity constraints. Maggiore and Shifman [16] suggested that as Q2 increases,\nor equivalently as the instanton-antiinstanton separation decreases, multi-instanton effects become important.\nUnitarization can be simply enforced by resumming a\nchain of alternating instanton-antiinstanton configurations, leading to a unitarized amplitude confirming Zakharov's observations.\nFollowing on Maggiore and Shifman suggestion in the\nbaryon number violation problem, we perform the large\nQ2 integration in (49) using iterated multi-instanton contributions. This is similar to (although different from)\nthe usual treatment of resonances, when the attractive\ninteraction is iterated and leads to a Breit-Wigner result.\nSpecifically, the imaginary part in (49) now reads\n\u221e\nX\n\nn\n\n\u03ba0 (\u03ba0 i B(Q))\n\n,\n\nV. SOFT POMERON FROM INSTANTONS\n\nIn this section we will show that in the semiclassical analysis the parton-parton cross-section increases at\nmost as ln s, while the hadron-hadron cross section as\na polynomial in ln s, with a degree fixed by the number of hard collisions in the transverse plane. We show\nthat Reggeization follows when the number of collisions\nbecomes large.\n\nA. Intercept\n\n\u221a\nThe parton-parton cross section at large s with \u2212t/s\nsmall, receives contributions from both perturbative gluons and instantons. Generically, the perturbative contributions are\n\u0001\n\u03c3\u2217 (s, t) \u2248 \u03c0 \u03c12\u2217 (\u03b1s /\u03c0)2 + # (\u03b1s /\u03c0)3 ln s + ... , (57)\n\n(53)\n\nn=1\n\nfor alternating insertions of instantons and antiinstantons\n(chain). Each factor of iB results from the insertion of an\nextra instanton or antiinstanton on the chain, producing\na bond with an extra unstable mode. Hence, the total\ncross section is\nZ\n16 1\n2\n\u03c3 \u2248 \u03c0 \u03c10 ln s\ndq1\u22a5 dq2\u22a5 K(q1\u22a5 , q2\u22a5 )\n15 (2\u03c0)8\nZ \u221e\n\u03ba0 B(Q)\n.\n(54)\ndQ2\n\u00d7\u03ba0\n2\n1\n+\n\u03ba20 B(Q)2\n(q1 +q2 )\u22a5\n\nwhere 1/\u03c1\u2217 is some perturbative QCD cutoff scale, at\nwhich the running \u03b1s should be defined. Instantons contribute partly to the constant part of the cross section\nterm [6], along with other non-perturbative contributions. Fortunately, we do not have to go into all of this\nby noting that the magnitude of the total quark-quark\ncross section\u221acan be assessed in a model independent way.\nIndeed, for s \u2248 30 GeV the pp cross section does not\ngrow yet, so that the sea quarks and gluonic contributions can be ignored. Hence, a simple additive quark\nmodel estimate yields\n\nThe integrand in (54) rises with B(Q) as expected in\nthe small Q regime and falls off as 1/B(Q) due to unitarization. The dominant contribution takes place at the\nsphaleron invariant mass\nB(Qs ) \u2248 1/\u03ba0\n\n\u03c3qq =\n\n(55)\n\nfor which the total cross section (40) becomes\nZ\n16 1\ndq1\u22a5 dq2\u22a5 K(q1\u22a5 , q2\u22a5 ) . (56)\n\u03c3 \u2248 \u03c0\u03c120 ln s \u03ba0\n15 (2\u03c0)8\nNote that under the condition (55) the Q2 -integration\namounts to a number of order 1, a measure of the area\nunder the curve peaked at Qs with maximum 1/2 and\nwidth of order 1. The rise in the partial inelastic cross\nsection due to multi-instanton effects results into an increase of the cross section by one power of the diluteness\nfactor which is about a 100-fold increase. The inelastic\ncross section grows logarithmically with s, in contrast to\nour original quasi-elastic estimate [6].\nThe energy following from (55) implies that half of the\noriginal instanton-antiinstanton action of 2 \u00d7 (8\u03c0 2 /g 2 )\nis compensated by their attraction. In other words, the\ns-exchange in the inelastic process starting from the vacuum is half-instanton. This is the transition from vacuum\nto a static QCD sphaleron. This leads us to the following important observation: at high energy, the inelastic s-channel contributions to parton-parton scattering in\nleading logarithm approximation are QCD sphalerons.\n\n1\n\u03c3pp \u2248 3.3 mb\n9\n\n(58)\n\nwhere the inelastic cross section \u03c3pp \u2248 30 mb has been\nused.

The\nupper curve refers to instantons with unmodified vacuum sizes (a = 0), while the lower curve corresponds to\nslightly smaller instantons (a = 0.25). The trajectory\nnever crosses zero, implying that the cross\n\u221a section grows\nin the physical region with increasing \u2212t.\nWe note\n\u221a that the trajectories decrease rapidly with increasing \u2212t, showing that most of the variation is located around 0. The induced trajectories are sensitive\nto the instanton size through a rescaling of the induced\nform-factor by the parameter a. Indeed, the slope \u2206\u2032 (0)\nrelates to the pomeron slope through,\n\n(63)\n\nA numerical estimate of (62) can be made using the parameterization (48) which removes the unphysical singularity at q\u22a5 = 0. The result is\n\u2206(0) = 2.37 \u03ba0 \u2248 0.03 ,\n\n(64)\n\nwhich is smaller than the phenomenological intercept of\n0.08 [21] for the soft pomeron. This is of no concern, since\nthe instanton density itself is known within a factor 2 and\nmaybe updated upward 7 . Additional effects absent in\nthe present instanton estimate will be discussed below.\nOur main conclusion is that the smallness of the soft\npomeron intercept directly reflects on the diluteness of\nthe instantons in the QCD vacuum, thereby providing\nus with a first hand empirical glimpse to this important\nparameter.\n\n\u2206\u2032 (0) = \u03b1\u2032 = (0.5 \u2212 0.2)/GeV2 ,\n\nwith 0.5 corresponding to the unmodified instanton induced form factor (a = 0) and 0.2 corresponding to a\nscaled down instanton induced form factor (a = 0.25).\nOur main point is that the smallness of the soft\npomeron intercept \u03b1\u2032 reflects directly on the smallness\nof the squared instanton radius. Our trajectory curves\nare similar to those reported by KKL [11] (who also continued their trajectories to the unphysical region t > 0).\nHowever, this comparison is only qualitative, since the\ninduced form factor used in KKL differs fundamentally\nfrom the one we have derived (see discussion below). The\nissue of the size dependence was not addressed in [11].\n\nB. Slope\n\nThe t-dependence in the parton-parton cross section\nfollows from the inelastic processes with net momentum\nflow in the t-channel.

The squares refer to the unmodified instanton shape and the circles to the modified one.\n\nC. Instanton Shape Dependence\n7\n\nLattice studies confirm the \"standard\" value quoted above,\nin the \"deep cooling\" regime, where only well separated instantons relevant for chiral symmetry breaking are retained.\nThe vacuum contains also a large density of close instantonantiinstanton pairs eliminated by \"cooling\". Those are irrelevant for the light quark condensate but are relevant for high\nenergy scattering.\n\nAn ensemble of instantons in the QCD vacuum is always described by retaining the instanton configurations\nin the singular gauge, where the topological singularity is\n\n11\n\n\flocated at the instanton center8 . In the singular gauge,\nthe instanton gauge field falls off as A \u2248 \u03c120 /x3 at large\nx, providing a ground for a dilute analysis. By keeping\nthe topological properties at the center, a modification\nof the \"tail\" of the gauge field at large distances may\nbe allowed. Moreover, since the semi-classical analysis\nholds only for strong fields, these tail modifications are\nin general expected.\nThere are many effects which can modify the tail of the\ninstantons, an example is through interactions. Indeed\nan early variational estimate of the instanton vacuum\nenergy using exponentially modified instanton form factors such as e\u2212a x/\u03c10 [23] show a minimum at a \u2248 0.5.\nOther possible reasons for instanton-shape modifications\ncan be due to confinement as discussed in the context\nof the QCD dual superconductor [24]. Lattice studies of\nvarious gluonic correlators also show rapid exponential\nfall-off. Thinking about the lowest glueballs, with their\n2 GeV mass scales as 2-gluon bound state, may imply an\neven larger sizing down with a \u2248 1.\nInterestingly enough, the phenomenological issue regarding the instanton shape has never been seriously addressed. It is because (to our knowledge) all previous\napplications of instanton physics in QCD were found to\nbe generally insensitive to it. Indeed, most applications\n(see [3]) are related to light quarks and fermionic zero\nmodes, which exist and are normalized independently of\nthe instanton field. Also, the correlators of the scalar\nfield strength combination G2\u03bc\u03bd [25] are instanton-shape\ninsensitive since they fall-off rapidly at large x (as 1/x8\nin perturbation theory). This is in sharp contrast to the\npresent case, where the induced form factors fall-off as\n1/x2\u22a5 and their integrated effect in the transverse plane\n(through dx\u22a5 ) diverges logarithmically.\nInstanton-shape modifications cause our results (intercept and slope) to change quantitativaly, showing the\nlimitations in the present analysis. To illustrate this,\nconsider changing the description from regular to singular gauge and inserting the exponential modifications in\nthe instanton tails. Hence, the argument in the definition\nof the induced instanton form factor J changes accordingly\n!\n|x|\n\u03c0 |x|\np\n(68)\n\u2192\u03c0 p\n\u2212 1 e\u2212a |x|/\u03c10 .\nx2 + \u03c120\nx2 + \u03c120\n\nD. Reggeization\n\nHadrons are usually composed of several partons, each\ncapable of a pair-collision in the transverse plane. Even\nwith only 3 quarks in a nucleon (ignoring \"primordial\"\nglue etc), we have 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 possible sub-collisions in the\nNN case. Their probability depends on the quark distribution in the transverse plane which is given by some pertinent light-cone wave functions. The latters will not be\nimportant for the qualitative arguments to follow. The\nchief argument is that since the hadron diffractive size\nRH (RH \u2248 3r0 \u2248 1 fm) is large in comparison to the\ninteraction range, the maximum number of independent\n2\ncollisions can be as large as N\u2217 \u2248 RH\n/\u03c120 \u2248 10 \u226b 1.

WEAK-FIELD APPROXIMATION\n\nIn this section we will provide some qualitative arguments regarding the relationship between the semiclassical analysis carried above and the weak-field approximation used in previous analyses, e.g. in KKL [11].\nA. Weizsacker-Williams Approximation\n\nThe effect on the form-factor J is illustrated in Fig. 2.\nIn the unmodified case with a = 0 (top points) the form\nfactor rises towards small momentum transfer, which is\nnot the case for a > 0.

They make all transfer integrations finite,\nthereby determining the magnitude of the cross section.\nThey also keep the instanton effects from being part of\nthe hard processes.

The interference (a) and interaction (b) diagrams\nnot included in our analysis.\n\nwas derived using the weak-field limit. (75) is simply\nthe Fourier transform of the instanton field (27). The\nweak-field approximation is justified if only a single-gluon\nexchange between the through-going parton and the instanton is registered. The single-gluon approximation is\njustified when the parton impact parameter exceeds the\ninstanton size \u03c10 , which is equivalent to q\u22a5 \u03c10 \u226a 1. But\nin this case, the form factor (75) reduces to 1.\nIn general, the parton-instanton interaction takes place\nwhen the incoming parton punches through the instanton at an impact parameter comparable to the instanton\n\nA. Interference and Interaction\n\nThe diagrams shown in Fig. 4 describe additional interference (a) and interaction (b) effects between the gluonic radiation from the hard partons and the instanton,\nwhich we have not considered in our analysis. The interference of the radiation (a) with the instantons can\nbe argued to be small, for the following reason. Kinematically the radiation from the external line has a flat\nrapidity distribution extending all the way to the rapidity\n\n13\n\n\fof the hard parton (see the Weizsacker-Williams approximation), while instantons produce about S0 \u2248 10 \u2212 15\ngluons within a cluster occupying one unit in rapidity\nspace. The overlap between the radiation and the 10-15\ngluons is about 1/ln s thereby compensating the logarithmic growth in the cross section.\nA possible way to include the radiation effects is to\ncalculate the eikonal factors W in the combined field of\nan instanton-antiinstanton in the simplest sum ansatz.\nThe interaction diagrams (b) can then be viewed as additional corrections to this simple ansatz, diagrammatically describing a more appropriate solution. Since no\nanalytical formulae for path-order exponents in a field\nmore complicated than that of a single instanton is available, inclusion of those corrections would complicate the\npresent analysis considerably. We hope to report on these\neffects elsewhere.\n\nbative. Indeed, in the simplest constituent quark model\nfor hadron spectroscopy the effective wave-function for\nq\u0304q and qqq still requires the help of a confining potential, or a QCD string. Therefore our results should be\nimproved by including the corresponding effects of lightcone wave-functions.\nFinally, phenomenological structure functions, even\ntaken at low normalization points, do exhibit a non-zero\ngluon density. This suggests that there are also throughgoing gluons inside the high energy nucleon or photon10 ,\nfor which the instanton-induced cross section has not\nbeen assessed yet. There is no technical difficulty to do\nso along the lines we have presented, and we expect their\ncross section to be generally larger, improving the agreement between our theoretical prediction and empirical\nrate of the cross section growth.\nVIII. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK\n\nB. Additional Partons\n\nIn this work we have extended our evaluation of the instanton\ncontribution to the scattering of partons at large\n\u221a\ns and small \u2212t/s, from quasi-elastic to inelastic collisions. The present findings and results support our original analysis [6] stressing the importance of instantons\nin high-energy and near-forward scattering amplitudes\nin QCD. Although our analysis differs significantly from\nthe one recently reported by KKL in [11], the underlying physics is about the same. All in all, instantons are\nshown to play a significant role in diffractive processes.\nThroughout, we have tried to make a consistent use\nof purely semiclassical treatments. The interactions with\nthe through-going partons are included in the eikonalized factors, with any number of gluons, and the inelastic production of any number of gluons is summed\ninto an instanton-anti-instanton interaction. Both approaches have been developed previously, but their combined application to the soft pomeron problem is new.\nAt higher invariant masses of the produced system, we\nalso carried out unitarity considerations (through a chain\nof alternating instanton and antiinstanton) in somewhat\nmore details than it has been done previously.\nMajor differences between quasi-elastic and inelastic\nprocesses have been found. (i) The production of an in-\n\nAs we did emphasize at the beginning of this paper,\nour analysis of the collision processes is based on the\nparton model, whereby the parton-parton cross sections\n(evaluated) are separated from the hadronic wave functions (not evaluated). The separation depends on what\nis exactly meant by our distinction of a parton from\nthrough-going quark, which is of course scale dependent.\nIn our case, the separation scale is set by the mean instanton size \u03c10 \u2248 1/(600 MeV) \u2248 1/3 fm. This choice may\nappear to be in contradiction with the usual statement\nthat perturbative QCD cannot be used below the scale\nof 1 GeV. However, there is no contradiction if those deviations from perturbative QCD are precisely due to the\ninstanton effects we account for. For phenomenological\nand theoretical arguments in favor of this view-point in\nthe vacuum we refer to [3,26]. Our present analysis, extends these arguments to diffractive scattering. Although\nwe have ignored perturbative gluons and field-theoretical\nrenormalizations of all quantities discussed, we believe\nthey have to be included around our semi-classical treatment for our results to be complete.\nAt the low normalization scale of order 0.6 GeV the\npartons are dressed by their surrounding fields, perturbative and non-perturbative, and for all purposes are effective objects. This is why we refered above to the nucleon as being made of 3 quarks, the photon of a quarkanti-quark, etc. Most of the glue and the sea quarks\nand antiquarks seen in DIS structure functions reside inside those effective objects. The simplest part of the\ndressings are \"wee\" partons included above in the W factors. These are mostly the perturbative fields surrounding the parton9 . Still, not all parton dressing is pertur-\n\n9\n\nthrough g was retained. This is supported by experimental data from HERA, showing that at the low normalization\npoint Q2 \u2248 1 GeV2 , the gluonic density is about flat (even decreasing) towards small x. If there is a need to describe hard\nprocesses, then additional diagrams as for instance those retained in the DGLAP evolution, should be included to reach\nhigher normalization points and account for the growing gluon\ndensity towards small x.\n10\nIn the stochastic vacuum model [27], those gluonexchanges originating from the canvassing strings are assumed\nto be even dominant in the hadronic cross section.\n\nIn the eikonalized form factors only the lowest coupling\n\n14\n\n\ftermediate multi-gluon system leads to a ln s growth in\nthe total cross section, opening up the possibility to explain soft pomeron physics after pertinent resummation.\n(ii) The inelastic cross section is much larger, in fact it is\nparametrically larger by an inverse power of the instanton diluteness parameter (about a factor of 100). The\npomeron intercept is small because it is simply proportional to the small instanton diluteness parameter in the\nQCD vacuum. (iii) The pomeron slope is small, because\nit is directly related to the instanton induced form-factors\non the eikonalized hard partons, hence to small instanton sizes in the QCD vacuum. (iv) For the first time\nin QCD applications of instantons, we have found that\nthe instanton shape at large distances from the center\ncan actually impact on a physical observable such as the\npomeron slope.\nOur work can be extended in a number of ways. The\nmost straightforward extension is to small size dipoles [6]\nand gluons as partons participating in scattering. Small\nsize dipole scattering is related to processes with virtual\nphotons, such as \u03b3 \u2217 h and \u03b3 \u2217 \u03b3 and even \u03b3 \u2217 \u03b3 \u2217 with two\nvirtual photons. The next set of questions which can be\nalso addressed in the present framework relates to the\nnature of the produced multi-gluon systems in the exclusive reactions, or the \"sphaleron decay\" problem. The\ntotal cross section we evaluated can be decomposed into\npertinent channels with given quantum numbers involving specific hadrons and glueballs. Since in the inelastic processes, particle production is in general masked\nby multiple production from string decays from the final\nstage, we suggest to focus on double diffractive cross sections where the produced hadrons are selected alone and\nseparated by large rapidity gaps from the target and the\nprojectile.\nFinally, one may ask what happens at very large energies. We have briefly discussed a semiclassical resummation of our basic process, resulting in a cross section growing as ln s. The total hadron-hadron cross\nsection resulted from a Poissonian resummation of pairindependent parton-parton scatterings or bushes. We\nhave not addressed the issue of rescattering between the\nproduced gluons as in the instanton ladders considered in\nKKL [11], although this can be explored beyond the semiclassical framework we have detailed. Clearly, a thorough\ncomparison of the present ideas and results with the data\nwill eventually tells us if there is room for hypothetical\nprimordial small x partons, distinct from the usual dressing of valence quarks and residing in different positions\nin the transverse plane.\n\n[1] A.A.
