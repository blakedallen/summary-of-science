Gromov's Volume Comparison Theorem\n[Gr] gives such a relation for maps into negatively curved manifolds. In\nthis paper we extend Gromov's theorem to locally symmetric manifolds of\nnonpositive curvature.\nThe key fact we prove is: any continuous map f : N \u2192 M between\nclosed manifolds, with M nonpositively curved and locally symmetric (barring a few exceptions), is homotopic to a C 1 map with universally bounded\nJacobian, depending only on smallest Ricci curvatures of M, N . We use this\nto prove the following.\nTheorem 1.1 (The Degree Theorem). Let M be a closed, locally symmetric n-manifold with nonpositive sectional curvatures. Assume that M has\nno local direct factors locally isometric to Rk , H2 , or SL3 (R)/ SO3 (R). Then\nfor any closed Riemannian manifold N and any continuous map f : N \u2192 M ,\ndeg(f ) \u2264 C\n\nVol(N )\nVol(M )\n\nwhere C > 0 depends only on n and the smallest Ricci curvatures of N and\nM.\nRemarks.\n1. As tori have self-maps of arbitrary degree, it is easy to see that the\ntheorem would be false without the \"no Rk factors\" hypothesis. We\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nSupported in part by an NSF postdoctoral fellowship.\nSupported in part by the NSF and the Sloan foundation.\n\n1\n\n\fbelieve that the \"no H2 or SL3 (R)/ SO3 (R) local factors\" hypothesis\nis unnecessary; we show in Example 4.6, however, that the issue is\ndelicate, and depends on the chosen class of metrics on N .\n2. By scaling the metrics it is easy to see that the dependence of the\nconstant C on the smallest curvatures cannot be improved. Actually,\nwe determine the constant explicitly in terms of the symmetric space\nand the volume entropy of N (see \u00a72.1).\n3. In \u00a76.2 we extend Theorem 1.1 to the case where N and M have finite\nvolume (with \"bounded geometry\") but are not necessarily compact,\nand where f is a coarse Lipshitz map.\nWhen dim(M ) = 2 the conclusion of the theorem follows easily from\nthe Gauss-Bonnet Theorem. When rank(M ) = 1, Besson-Courtois-Gallot\n[BCG1] proved the stronger entropy rigidity theorem, giving the exact best\nconstant C. Entropy rigidity is still open in higher rank 1 ; this would correspond\nthe above theorem with the constant C in the inequality being\n\u0010 to \u0011\nn\nh(g)\nC = h(g0 ) , where h(g) is the volume entropy of g (see [BCG1]), with\nequality being obtained iff g = g0 locally symmetric.\nThe Besson-Courtois-Gallot technique is a central ingredient here; indeed\nthe main idea in our proof of Theorem 1.1 is to give a higher rank version\nof the \"canonical map\" of [BCG1], and to give an a priori bound on its\nJacobian. This bound is of independent interest, and constitutes a first step\ntowards proving higher rank entropy rigidity.\nThe Minvol invariant. One of the basic invariants associated to a smooth\nmanifold M is its minimal volume:\nMinvol(M ) := inf {Vol(M, g) : |K(g)| \u2264 1}\ng\n\nwhere g ranges over all smooth metrics on M and K(g) denotes the sectional\ncurvature of g. The basic questions about Minvol(M ) are: for which M is\nMinvol(M ) > 0? when is Minvol(M ) realized by some metric g?\nWhen a nonpositively curved manifold M has a local direct factor locally\nisometric to Rk , it is easy to see that Minvol(M ) = 0. By taking f to be the\nidentity map (while varying the metric g on M ), Theorem 1.1 immediately\ngives:\n1\n\nEntropy rigidity has recently been proved [BCG3, CF] for manifolds locally modelled\non products of rank one symmetric spaces with no H2 factors.\n\n2\n\n\fCorollary 1.2 (Positivity of Minvol). Let M be any finite volume, locally symmetric n-manifold (n \u2265 2) of nonpositive curvature. Assume that\nM has no local direct factors locally isometric to Rk , H2 , or SL3 (R)/ SO3 (R).\nThen Minvol(M ) > 0.\nFor compact M , Corollary 1.2 was proved (without the H2 and SL(3, R)\nrestriction) in [Gr2] (see also [Sa] for the case manifolds locally modelled\non the symmetric space for SL(n, R)). When M is real hyperbolic, BessonCourtois-Gallot [BCG1] proved that Minvol(M ) is uniquely realized by the\nlocally symmetric metric. It seems possible that this might hold in general.\nSelf maps and the co-Hopf property.\nAs deg(f n ) = deg(f )n , an\nimmediate corollary of Theorem 1.1 is the following.\nCorollary 1.3 (Self maps). Let M be a finite-volume locally symmetric\nmanifold as in Theorem 1.1. Then M admits no self-maps of degree > 1. In\nparticular, \u03c01 (M ) is co-Hopfian: every injective endomorphism of \u03c01 (M ) is\nsurjective.\nNote that Corollary 1.3 may also be deduced from Margulis's Superrigidity theorem (for higher rank M ). The co-Hopf property for lattices was first\nproved by Prasad [Pr].\nMore generally, if N and M are as in Theorem 1.1 and f : N \u2192 M\nand g : M \u2192 N are two maps of nonzero degree then they both must have\ndegree one since f \u25e6 g is a self map of M .\nOutline of the proof of Theorem 1.1.\nGiven f : N \u2192 M as in\nthe hypothesis of the theorem, we use the method of [BCG1, BCG2] to\nconstruct a \"canonical\" map F : N \u2192 M which is homotopic to f (hence\ndegF = degf ). The main difficulty is to then give a universal bound on\nthe Jacobian of F ; once this is done a simple degree argument gives the\ntheorem.\nStep 1 (Constructing the map): First consider the case when the metric\non N is nonpositively curved. Denote by Y (resp. X) the universal cover of\nN (resp. M ). Let M(\u2202Y ), M(\u2202X) denote the spaces of atomless probability\nmeasures on the visual boundaries of the universal covers Y, X.\nMorally what we do is, following the method of [BCG2], to define a map\n\u03c6\u2217\nbar\nFe : Y \u2192 M(\u2202Y ) \u2192 M(\u2202X) \u2192 X\n\nwhere \u03c6\u2217 = \u2202 fe\u2217 is the pushforward of measures and bar is the \"barycenter\nof a measure\" (see \u00a73). The inclusion Y \u2192 M(\u2202Y ), denoted x 7\u2192 \u03bcx ,\n3\n\n\fis given by the construction of the Patterson-Sullivan measures {\u03bcx }x\u2208X\ncorresponding to \u03c01 (N ) < Isom(Y ) (see \u00a72). An essential feature of these\nconstructions is that they are all canonical, so that all of the maps are\nequivariant. Hence Fe descends to a map F : N \u2192 M .\nOne problem with this construction outline is that the metric on Y may\nnot be nonpositively curved. So we must find an alternative to using the\n\"visual boundary\" of Y . This is done by constructing a certain family of\nsmooth measures \u03bcs on Y itself, pushing them forward via fe, and convolving with Patterson-Sullivan measure on X. Maps Fes are then defined by\ntaking the barycenters of these measures; it is actually these maps which\nare considered instead of F . This idea was first introduced in [BCG1].\nTwo new features of F appear in higher rank. First, the non-strictness\nof convexity of the Busemann function (see \u00a73) must be overcome to define\nF . Second, and more importantly, a theorem of Albuquerque shows that the\nsupport of each of the measures \u03bcx is codimension rank(X) \u2212 1 subset of \u2202X\ncalled the Furstenburg boundary of X (see \u00a72). This fact and its implications\nare crucial for later steps.\nStep 2 (The Jacobian estimate): The heart of the paper ( \u00a74 and \u00a75) is\nobtaining a universal bound on F , independent of f . For this we first realize\nthe Jacobian of F as the ratio of determinants of two matrix integrals. We\nthen show that whenever there are small eigenvalues in the denominator\nthere are a sufficient number of small eigenvalues in the numerator with\nwhich to cancel them. The key is to find these eigenvalues independently of\nthe integrating measure (which depends on \u03bcs ), therefore reducing it to a\nproblem about semisimple Lie groups.\nStep 3 (Finishing the proof ): Once a universal bound on | Jac(F )| is\nfound, a simple degree argument finishes the proof. In the case when M and\nN are not compact, the main difficulty is proving that Fs is proper. This\nis quite technical, and requires extending some of the ideas of [BCS] to the\nhigher rank setting.\n\n2\n\nPatterson-Sullivan measures on symmetric spaces\n\nIn this section we briefly recall Albuquerque's theory [Al] of PattersonSullivan measures in higher rank symmetric spaces. For background on\nnonpositively curved manifolds, symmetric spaces, visual boundaries, Busemann functions, etc., we refer the reader to [BGS] and [Eb].\n\n4\n\n\f2.1\n\nBasic properties\n\nLet X be a Riemannian symmetric space of noncompact type. Denote by\n\u2202X the visual boundary of X; that is, the set of equivalence classes of\ngeodesic rays in X, endowed with the cone topology. Hence X \u222a \u2202X is a\ncompactification of X which is homeomorphic to a closed ball.\nThe volume entropy h(g) of a closed Riemannian n-manifold (M, g) is\ndefined as\n1\nlog(Vol(B(x, R)))\nh(g) = lim\nR\u2192\u221e R\nwhere B(x, R) is the ball of radius R around a fixed point x in the universal\ncover X. The number h(g) is independent of the choice of x, and equals the\ntopological entropy of the geodesic flow on (M, g) when the curvature K(g)\nsatisfies K(g) \u2264 0. Note that while the volume Vol(M, g) is not invariant\nunder scaling the metric g, the normalized entropy\nent(g) = h(g)n Vol(M, g)\nis scale invariant.\nLet \u0393 be a lattice in Isom(X), so that h(g0 ) < \u221e where (M, g0 ) is \u0393\\X\nwith the locally symmetric metric.\nGeneralizing the construction of Patterson-Sullivan, Albuquerque constructs in [Al] a family of Patterson-Sullivan measures on \u2202X. This is a\nfamily of probability measures {\u03bdx }x\u2208X on \u2202X which provide a particularly\nnatural embedding of X into the space of probability measures on \u2202X.\nTheorem 2.1 (Existence Theorem, [Al]). There exists a family {\u03bdx } of\nprobability measures on \u2202X satisfying the following properties:\n1. Each \u03bdx has no atoms.\n2. The family of measures {\u03bdx } is \u0393-equivariant:\n\u03b3\u2217 \u03bdx = \u03bd\u03b3x for all \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393\n3. For all x, y \u2208 X, the measure \u03bdy is absolutely continuous with respect\nto \u03bdx . In fact the Radon-Nikodym derivative is given explicitly by:\nd\u03bdx\n(\u03be) = eh(g)B(x,y,\u03be)\nd\u03bdy\n\n5\n\n(1)\n\n\fwhere B(x, y, \u03be) is the Busemann function on X. For points x, y \u2208 X\nand \u03be \u2208 \u2202X, the function B : X \u00d7 X \u00d7 \u2202X \u2192 R is defined by\nB(x, y, \u03be) = lim dX (y, \u03b3\u03be (t)) \u2212 t\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nwhere \u03b3\u03be is the unique geodesic ray with \u03b3(0) = x and \u03b3(\u221e) = \u03be.\nThe second property implies no two measures are the same as measures.\nThus the assignment x 7\u2192 \u03bdx defines an injective map\n\u03bd : X \u2192 M(\u2202X)\nwhere M(\u2202X) is the space of probability measures on X. Such a mapping\nsatisfying the above properties is called an h(g0 )-conformal density.\n\n2.2\n\nSymmetric spaces of noncompact type\n\nBefore we present Albuquerque's theorem we will need some necessary background about higher rank symmetric spaces.\nBy definition, the symmetric space X is G/K where G is a semisimple\nLie group and K a maximal compact subgroup. Fix once and for all a\nbasepoint p \u2208 X. This choice uniquely determines a Cartan decomposition\ng = k \u2295 p of the Lie algebra of G where k is the Lie algebra of the isotropy\nsubgroup K = StabG (p) of p in G and p is orthogonal to k with respect to\nthe killing form B(*, *) on g. Therefore, p is also identified with the tangent\nspace Tp X.\nLet a be, once and for all, a fixed maximal abelian subalgebra of g. It\nfollows from the Cartan decomposition that a \u2282 p. The set exp(a) * p will be\na maximal flat (totally geodesically embedded Euclidean space of maximal\ndimension) in X. Recall, a vector v \u2208 T X is called a regular vector if it\nis tangent to a unique maximal flat. Otherwise it is a singular vector. A\ngeodesic is called regular (resp. singular) if one (and hence all) of its tangent\nvectors are regular (singular). A point \u03be \u2208 \u2202X is regular (singular) if any\n(and hence all) of the geodesics in the corresponding equivalence class are\nregular (singular).\nLet a\u2217 be the dual to a, then for each \u03b1 \u2208 a\u2217 define\ng\u03b1 = {Y \u2208 g| adA Y = \u03b1(A)Y for all A \u2208 a}.\nWe call \u03b1 a root if g\u03b1 6= 0. Therefore the roots form a finite set \u039b.\nIf \u03b8p is the Cartan involution associated to the point p, which is Id on k\nand \u2212 Id on p, then we may define a positive definite inner product \u03c6p on\n6\n\n\fg by \u03c6p (Y, Z) = \u2212B(\u03b8p Y, Z). With respect to \u03c6p , the folowing root space\ndecomposition\nX\ng = g0 +\ng\u03b1\n\u03b1\u2208\u039b\n\nis orthogonal.\nThe following is proposition can be found in 2.7.3 of [Eb].\n\nProposition 2.2. Some properties of the roots and root space decomposition are:\n1. [g\u03b1 , g\u03b2 ] \u2282 g\u03b1+\u03b2 if \u03b1 + \u03b2 \u2208 \u039b or is 0 otherwise.\n2. If \u03b1 \u2208 \u039b then \u2212\u03b1 \u2208 \u039b and \u03b8p : g\u03b1 \u2192 g\u2212\u03b1 is an isomorphism.\n3. If \u03b1 is not an integer multiple of some other \u03bb \u2208 \u039b then the only\npossible multiples of \u03b1 in \u039b are \u00b1\u03b1 and \u00b12\u03b1.\n4. We have g0 = (g0 \u2229 k) + a.\nh\u03b1,\u03b2i\n5. If \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 \u039b then \u03b2 \u2212 2 h\u03b1,\u03b1i\n\u03b1 \u2208 \u039b where h*, *i is the dual inner product\nh\u03b1,\u03b2i\nis always an integer and if \u03b1 and \u03b2\nto \u03c6p on a\u2217 . Furthermore, 2 h\u03b1,\u03b1i\nare not collinear then it is \u00b11.\n\nWe call a subset \u2206 \u2282 \u039b a base for \u039b if\n1. the elements of \u2206 form a basis (over R) for a\u2217 ,\n2. and every root in \u039b can be written as a linear combination of of elements in \u2206 with coefficients being either all nonnegative integers or\nall nonpositive integers.\nIf we choose an regular element A \u2208 a then define the set of positive roots\ncorresponding to A,\n\u039b+\nA = {\u03b1 \u2208 \u039b|\u03b1(A) \u2265 0}\n\n+\nThe subset \u2206+\nA \u2282 \u039bA consisting of elements which cannot be written as\n+\na sum of two elements in \u039b+\nA is a base for \u039b. Sometimes \u2206A is called a\nfundamental system of positive roots.\nFor A \u2208 a the associated (open) Weyl chamber W (A) is the connected\ncomponent of the set of regular vectors in a which contains A. We also\ncall the set exp W (A) \u2282 exp(a), as well as exp(W (A)) * p \u2282 X, a Weyl\nchamber which we again denote by W (A) using the context to determine\nwhere exactly it lies.\n\n7\n\n\fThe union of all the singular geodesics in the flat exp(a) * p passing\nthrough p is a finite set of hyperplanes forming the boundaries of the Weyl\nchambers. This provides another description of the Weyl chamber W (A) as\nW (A) = {Y \u2208 a|\u03b1(Y ) > 0 for all \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206+\nA }.\nFor each subset I \u2282 \u2206+\nA the set WI (A) = \u2229\u03b1\u2208I (ker \u03b1 \u2229 W (A) is called the\nWeyl chamber face corresponding to the set I, and we designate W\u2205 (A) =\nW (A). The subgroup of K which stabilizes the face WI (A) we denote by\nKI .\n\n2.3\n\nThe Furstenberg Boundary\n\nThe Furstenberg boundary of a symmetric space X of noncompact type is\nabstractly defined to be G/P where P is a minimal parabolic subgroup of\nthe connected component G of the identity in Isom(X).\nThe Furstenberg boundary can be identified with the orbit of G acting\non any regular point v(\u221e) \u2208 \u2202X, the endpoint of a geodesic tangent to a\nregular vector v. of a Weyl chamber in a fixed flat a. This follows from the\nfact that the action of any such P on \u2202X fixes some regular point.\nBecause of this, for symmetric spaces of higher rank, behaviour on the visual boundary can often be aptly described by its restriction to the Furstenberg boundary. Here we will use only some very basic properties of this\nboundary. For more details on semisimple Lie groups and the Furstenberg\nboundary, see [Zi].\nFor a fixed regular vector A \u2208 a and associated set of positive roots \u039b+\nA\nthe barycenter b of the Weyl chamber W (A) is defined to be\nX\nb=\nm\u03b1 H \u03b1\n\u03b1\u2208\u039b+\nA\n\nwhere m\u03b1 = dim g\u03b1 is the multiplicty of \u03b1 and H\u03b1 is the dual vector (with\nrespect to \u03c6p ) of \u03b1. Set b+ = b/kbk.\nDefine the set \u2202F X \u2282 \u2202X to be \u2202F X = G * b+ (\u221e). Henceforth we will\nrefer to the Furstenberg boundary as this specific realization. We point out\nthat for any lattice \u0393 in Isom(X), the induced action on the boundary is\ntransitive only on \u2202F X. That is, \u0393 * b+ (\u221e) = G * b+ (\u221e) even though for\nany interior point x \u2208 X, \u0393 * x = \u2202X.\n\n8\n\n\f2.4\n\nAlbuquerque's Theorem\n\nTheorem 7.4 and Proposition 7.5 of [Al] combine to give the following theorem, which will play a crucial role in our proof of Theorem 1.1.\nTheorem 2.3 (Description of \u03bdx ). Let (X, g0 ) be a symmetric space of\nnoncompact type, and let \u0393 be a lattice in Isom(X). Then\n1. h(g0 ) = kbk,\n2. b+ (\u221e) is a regular point, and hence \u2202F X is a regular set,\n3. For any x \u2208 X, the support supp(\u03bdx ) of \u03bdx is equal to \u2202F X, and\n4. \u03bdx is the unique probability measure invariant under the action on \u2202F X\nof the compact isotropy group StabG (x) at x. In particular, \u03bdp is the\nunique K-invariant probability measure on \u2202F X.\nNote that when X is has rank one, \u2202F X = \u2202X. In general \u2202F X has\ncodimension rank(X) \u2212 1 in \u2202X.\n\n2.5\n\nLimits of Patterson-Sullivan measures\n\nWe now describe the asymptotic behaviour of the \u03bdx as x tends to a point\nin \u2202X.\nFor any point \u03be of the visual boundary, let S\u03b8 be the set of points \u03be \u2208 \u2202F X\nsuch that there is a Weyl chamber W whose closure \u2202W in \u2202X contains\nboth \u03b8 and \u03be. Let K\u03b8 be the subgroup of K which stabilizes S\u03b8 . K\u03b8 acts\ntransitively on S\u03b8 (see the proof below).\nTheorem 2.4 (Support of \u03bdx ). Given any sequence {xi } tending to \u03b8 \u2208\n\u2202X in the cone topology, the measures \u03bdxi converge in M(\u2202F X) to the unique\nK\u03b8 -invariant probability measure \u03bd\u03b8 supported on S\u03b8 .\nProof. Let xi = gi * p, for an appropriate sequence gi \u2208 G. Recall that\n\u03bdxi = (gi )\u2217 \u03bdp . Then combining part (4) of Theorem 2.3 with Proposition 9.43\nof [GJT] have that some subsequence of the \u03bdxi converges to a K\u03b8 -invariant\nmeasure \u03bd\u03b8 supported on S\u03b8 .\nNote that in [GJT], the notation I refers to a subset of a fundamental\nset of roots corresponding to the face of a Weyl chamber containing \u03b8 in its\nboundary. If gi * p = ki ai * p converges then both k = lim ki and aI = limi aIi\nexist (note the definition of aI in [GJT]). Again in the notation of [GJT],\n\n9\n\n\fK\u03b8 is the conjugate subgroup (kaI )K I (kaI )\u22121 in K. Moreover, S\u03b8 is the\norbit kaI K I * b+ (\u221e).\nBy Corollary 9.46 and Proposition 9.45 of [GJT] any other convergent\nsubsequence of the \u03bdxi produces the same measure in the limit, and therefore\nthe sequence \u03bdxi itself converges to \u03bd\u03b8 uniquely. \u22c4\nIn the case when \u03b8 is a regular point, the above theorem implies that\nS\u03b8 is a single point and the limit measure \u03bd\u03b8 is simply the Dirac probability\nmeasure at that point point in \u2202F X.\n\n3\n\nThe barycenter of a measure\n\nIn this section we describe the natural map which is an essential ingredient\nin the method of Besson-Courtois-Gallot.\nLet \u03c6 denote the lift to universal covers of f with basepoint p \u2208 Y (resp.\nf (p) \u2208 X), i.e. \u03c6 = fe : Y \u2192 X. We will also denote the metric and\nRiemannian volume form on universal cover Y by g and dg respectively.\nThen for each s > h(g) and y \u2208 Y consider the probability measure \u03bcsy on\nY in the Lebesgue class with density given by\nd\u03bcsy\ne\u2212sd(y,z)\n(z) = R \u2212sd(y,z) .\ndg\ndg\nY e\n\nThe \u03bcsy are well defined by the choice of s.\nConsider the push-forward \u03c6\u2217 \u03bcsy , which is a measure on X. Define \u03c3ys to\nbe the convolution of \u03c6\u2217 \u03bcsy with the Patterson-Sullivan measure \u03bdz for the\nsymmetric metric.\nIn other words, for U \u2282 \u2202X a Borel set, define\nZ\ns\n\u03bdz (U )d(\u03c6\u2217 \u03bcsy )(z)\n\u03c3y (U ) =\nX\n\nSince k\u03bdz k = 1, we have\nk\u03c3ys k = k\u03bcsy k = 1.\nLet B(x, \u03b8) = B(fe(p), x, \u03b8) be the Busemann function on X with respect\nto the basepoint fe(p) (which we will also denote by p). For s > h(g) and\nx \u2208 X, y \u2208 Y define a function\nZ\nB(x, \u03b8)d\u03c3ys (\u03b8)\nBs,y (x) =\n\u2202X\n\n10\n\n\fBy Theorem 2.4, the support of \u03bdz , hence of \u03c3ys , is all of \u2202F X, which in\nturn equals the G-orbit G * b+ (\u221e). Hence\nZ\nZ\ns\nB(x, \u03b8)d\u03c3ys (\u03b8).\nB(x, \u03b8)d\u03c3y (\u03b8) =\nBs,y (x) =\nG*b+ (\u221e)\n\n\u2202F X\n\nSince X is nonpositively curved, the Busemann function B is (nonstrictly) convex on X. Hence Bs,y is convex on X, being a convex integral\nof convex functions. While B is strictly convex only when X is negatively\ncurved, we have the following.\nProposition 3.1 (Strict convexity of B). For each fixed y and s, the\nfunction x 7\u2192 By,s (x) is strictly convex, and has a unique critical point in X\nwhich is its minimum.\nProof.\nIt suffices to show that given a geodesic segment \u03b3(t) between\ntwo points \u03b3(0), \u03b3(1) \u2208 X, there exists some \u03be \u2208 \u2202F X such that function\nB(\u03b3(t), \u03be) is strictly convex in t, and hence on an open positive \u03bcy -measure\nset around \u03be. We know it is convex by the comment preceding the statement\nof the proposition.\nIf B(\u03b3(t), \u03be) is constant on some geodesic subsegment of \u03b3 for some \u03be,\nthen \u03b3 must lie in some flat F such that the geodesic between \u03be \u2208 \u2202F and \u03b3\n(which meets \u03b3 at a right angle) also lies in F. On the other hand, \u03be \u2208 \u2202F X\nis in the direction of the algebraic centroid in a Weyl chamber, and \u03b3 is\nperpendicular to this direction. By the properties of the roots, \u03b3 is a regular\ngeodesic (i.e. \u03b3 is not contained in the boundary of a Weyl chamber). In\nparticular, \u03b3 is contained in a unique flat F. Furthermore, \u2202F X \u2229 \u2202F is a\nfinite set (an orbit of the Weyl group). As a result, for almost every \u03be \u2208 \u2202F X\nB(\u03b3(t), \u03be) is strictly convex in t.\nFor fixed z \u2208 X, by the last property listed in Theorem 2.1, we see that\nZ\nB(x, \u03b8)d\u03bdz (\u03b8)\n\u2202F X\n\ntends to \u221e as x tends to any boundary point \u03be \u2208 \u2202X. Then for fixed y\nand s > h(g), By,s (x) increases to \u221e as x tends to any boundary point\n\u03be \u2208 \u2202X. Hence it has a local minimum in X, which by strict convexity must\nbe unique. \u22c4\n\u03c3ys ,\n\nWe call the unique critical point of Bs,y the barycenter of the measure\nand define a map Fes : Y \u2192 X by\nFes (y) = the unique critical point of Bs,y\n11\n\n\fSince for any two points p1 , p2 \u2208 X\nB(p1 , x, \u03b8) = B(p2 , x, \u03b8) + B(p1 , p2 , \u03b8)\nwe see that Bs,y only changes by an additive constant when we change the\nbasepoint of B. Also, Bs,y only changes by a multiplicative constant when we\nchange the basepoint in the definition of \u03bcy . Since neither change affects the\ncritical point of By,s , we see that Fes is independent of choice of basepoints.\nThe equivariance of fe and of {\u03bcy } implies that Fes is also equivariant.\nHence Fes descends to a map Fs : N \u2192 M . It is easy to see that Fs is\nhomotopic to f .\nProposition 3.2. The map \u03a8s : [0, 1] \u00d7 N \u2192 M defined by\n\u03a8s (t, y) = Fs+\n\nt\n1\u2212t\n\n(y)\n\nis a homotopy between \u03a8s (0, *) = Fs and \u03a8s (1, *) = f .\nProof. From its definitions, Fes (y) is continuous in s and y. Observe that\nfor fixed y, lims\u2192\u221e \u03c3ys = \u03bd\u03c6(y) . If follows that lims\u2192\u221e Fes (y) = \u03c6(y). This\nimplies the proposition. \u22c4\nAs in [BCG1], we will see that Fs is C 1 , and will estimate its Jacobian.\n\n4\n\nThe Jacobian estimate\n\nLet X be expressed as a product of its irreducible factors X = X1 \u00d7. . .\u00d7Xk ,\nand let gi denote the restricted symmetric metric on each factor Xi . As\nabove, h(gi ) denotes the volume entropy of (Xi , gi ). The main estimate of\nthis paper is the following.\nTheorem 4.1 (The Jacobian Estimate). For all s > h(g) and all y \u2208\nN we have\n\u0013n\n\u0012\ns\n| Jac Fs (y)| \u2264 C\nh(g1 )h(g2 ) * * * h(gk )\nfor some constant C, depending only on dim M .\n\nDependence of constants. Up to scaling of the metric, there are only a\nfinite number of irreducible symmetric spaces of noncompact type in a given\ndimension. Therefore it is sufficient to show that C depends only on the individual symmetric spaces (Xi , gi ). Furthermore, when we apply Theorem 4.1,\n12\n\n\f\u0010\n\u0011n\nh(g)\nwe will take the limit as s \u2192 h(g) so that the quantity C h(g1 )h(g\n2 )***h(gk )\nis the constant appearing in Theorem 1.1. It is evident then that the right\nhand side of inequality of Theorem 1.1 is scale invariant with respect to the\nmetrics g and gi .\nWe claim that the quantities h(g) and h(gi ) can be bounded by Ricci\ncurvatures. The Bishop volume comparison Theorem ([BC]) states that if\nthe Ricci curvatures of (Y, g) are all greater than (n \u2212 1)\u03ba for some \u03ba \u2264 0\nthen for any y \u2208 Y and r > 0,\nVol B(y, r) \u2264 V\u03ba (r)\nwhere V\u03ba (r) is the volume of the ball of radius r in the space form of constant\ncurvature \u03ba. In particular this implies that\n\u221a\nlog V\u03ba (r)\n= (n \u2212 1) \u2212\u03ba.\nr\u2192\u221e\nr\n\nh(g) \u2264 lim\n\nSimilarly, in the course of the proof of Theorem 4.1 we will see explicitly\nthat\np\nh(gi ) = Tr \u2212Ri (b+ , *, b+ , *)\nwhere Ri is the curvature tensor on (Xi , gi ). In particular\nh(gi ) \u2265 min{1, \u2212 Ricci(b+ , b+ )}.\nTherefore the constant C in Theorem 1.1 depends only on the Ricci curvatures of N and M .\nWe will prove Theorem 4.1 in several steps.\n\n4.1\n\nFinding the Jacobian\n\nWe obtain the differential of Fs by implicit differentiation:\nZ\ndB(Fs (y),\u03b8) (*)d\u03c3ys (\u03b8)\n0 = Dx=Fs (y) Bs,y (x) =\n\u2202F X\n\nHence as 2-forms\nZ\nDdB(Fs (y),\u03b8) (Dy Fs (*), *)d\u03c3ys (\u03b8)\n0 = Dy Dx=Fs (y) Bs,y (x) =\n\u2202F X\nZ Z\ndB(Fs (y),\u03b8) (*) h\u2207y d(y, z), *i d\u03bd\u03c6(z) (\u03b8)d\u03bcsy (z)\n\u2212s\nY\n\n\u2202F X\n\n13\n\n\fThe distance function d(y, z) is Lipschitz and C 1 off of the cut locus\nwhich has Lebesgue measure 0.

In\nparticular, the ratio of the largest eigenvalue (denoted by \u03bbmax ) among the\n\u03bbi 's in D\u03bb to the smallest nonzero eigenvalue (denoted by \u03bbmin ) only depends\non X.\nFurthermore, since \u03b1(b+ ) > 0 for all \u03b1 \u2208 \u039b+\nA and dim p\u03b1 = m\u03b1 , we have\nq\nX\n1 X\nm\u03b1 m\u03b2 \u03b1(H\u03b2 ) =\nTr ad2b+ |p =\nm\u03b1 \u03b1(b+ ) =\nkbk\n+\n+\n\u03b1,\u03b2\u2208\u039bA\n\u03b1\u2208\u039bA\n*\n+\nX\nX\n1\nkbk2\n= h(g0 )\nm\u03b2 H \u03b2 ,\nm\u03b1 H \u03b1 =\nkbk\nkbk\n+\n+\n\u03b2\u2208\u039bA\n\n\u03b1\u2208\u039bA\n\nwhere the last equality follows from Theorem 2.3.

We now use the following.\n17\n\n(4)\n\n\fLemma 4.2. The determinant of a sum of n \u00d7 n positive semidefinite matrices is a nondecreasing homogeneous polynomial of degree n in the eigenvalues of each summand. Furthermore, if the sum is positive definite, then\nthe determinant is strictly increasing in the eigenvalues of the summands.\nProof. Let M be the sum of positive semidefinite matrices. Then there\nexist fixed orthogonal matrices Ol and real numbers \u03bbl,j such that M may\nbe written as\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u03bbl,1 0 * * *\n0\n.. \uf8f7\nX \uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0 \u03bbl,2 0\n. \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7 O\u2217\nM=\nOl \uf8ec .\n\uf8f7 l\n..\n.\n\uf8ed\n.\n0 \uf8f8\n.\n0\nl\n0 ***\n0 \u03bbl,n\nThen we have the differentiation formula (see, e.g. Prop. 2.8 of [Ch]):\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd\nd\ndet M = Tr\nM M adj\nd\u03bbl,j\nd\u03bbl,j\n\nwhere M adj is the adjunct matrix of M . Now,\nd\nM = Ol E(j,j) Ol\u2217\nd\u03bbl,j\nwhere E(j,j) is the elementary matrix with 1 in the (j, j) position and zeros\nelsewhere. Therefore, by cyclically permuting Ol in the trace above we find\nthat d\u03bbdl,j det M is the (j, j) the entry of Ol\u2217 M adj Ol which is nonnegative since\nM is positive semidefinite. Lastly, if M is positive definite then Ol\u2217 M adj Ol\nis also, which means that d\u03bbdl,j det M is positive. The lemma follows. \u22c4\nApplying Lemma 4.2 to the Riemann sums for the integral (3) above,\nusing the bound in Equation (4), and taking limits, gives\ndet\n\nZ\n\nDdB(Fs (y),\u03b8) (*, *)d\u03c3ys (\u03b8) \u2265\n\u2202F X\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\nZ\nh(g0 ) n\n0\n0\nO\u03b8\ndet\nO\u03b8\u2217 d\u03c3ys (\u03b8)\n0\nI\nc\nn\u2212rank(X)\n\u2202F X\n\nwhere In\u2212rank(X) is the identity matrix of dimension n \u2212 rank(X).\nNext we observe that, relative to the orthonormal basis {e1 , . . . , erank(X) }\nfor TFs (y) X, the expression\nZ\n2\ndB(F\nd\u03c3ys (\u03b8)\ns (y),\u03b8)\n\u2202F X\n\n18\n\n\fmay be written in the form\n\u0012\nZ\nO\u03b8\nQ1 =\n\u2202F X\n\n1\n\n01\u00d7(n\u22121)\n\n0(n\u22121)\u00d71 0(n\u22121)\u00d7(n\u22121)\n\n\u0013\n\nO\u03b8\u2217 d\u03c3ys (\u03b8)\n\nwhere O\u03b8 is the same matrix as above.

The rest of this section will be devoted to proving this.\n\n4.4\n\nEigenvalue matching\n\nHere is the general idea of our proof of Theorem 4.1, which we have reduced\nto showing (5) above. Since the numerator is bounded above, we consider\nwhen the matrix Q2 in the denominator has any eigenvalues smaller than a\ncertain constant depending only on the dimension of X. When this occurs,\nTheorem 4.4 below will show that each such eigenvalue is matched by at\nleast two smaller (up to a universal constant) eigenvalues of the matrix Q1\nin the numerator.\nLet {vi } be an orthonormal eigenbasis for the symmetric matrix Q2 , and\nrecall that {ei } is a basis for the tangent space F to the fixed, chosen flat.\nNote that the i-th eigenvalue of the matrix Q2 may be written as\nLi =\n\nvi\u2217 Q2 vi\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nn\nX\n\n\u2202F X j=rank(X)+1\n\nhO\u03b8 .ej , vi i2 d\u03c3ys (\u03b8).\n\nWe first argue that no Li equals zero. Since s > h(g) we have that the\nmeasures \u03bcsy is a finite measure in the Lebesgue class (dg). Since the \u03bdx for\nx \u2208 X are positive on any open set (with respect to the cone topology) of\n\u2202F X, it follows that \u03c3ys is as well. In particular, {O\u03b8 |\u03b8 \u2208 supp(\u03c3ys ) = \u2202F X}\nis isomorphic to the group K and therefore there is no nonzero subspace\nV \u2282 TFs (y) X such that O\u03b8 V \u2282 F for all \u03b8 \u2208 \u2202F X. Hence none of the\neigenvalues Li are 0.\nLet \u01eb = 1/(rank(X) + 1). Note that \u01eb is a constant depending only on n,\nas there are only finitely many symmetric spaces of a given rank and given\n19\n\n\fdimension. Suppose k of the eigenvalues are strictly less than \u01eb. Since each\nLi \u2264 1, and since\nX\nLi = Tr Q2 = n \u2212 rank(X)\ni\n\nit follows easily that k \u2264 rank(X). By rearranging the order we may assume\nthat Li < \u01eb for i = 1, * * * , k.\nLet H be an inner product space over R, and denote by SO(H) the\nspecial orthogonal group of H. Scale the bi-invariant metric on SO(H) so\nthat SO(H) has diameter \u03c0/2. Define the angle between two subspaces\nV, W \u2282 H as\n\u2220(V, W ) := inf{dSO(H) (I, P ) : P \u2208 SO(H) with P V \u2282 W or P W \u2282 V }\nLet \u03c0V (W ) represent the orthogonal projection of W onto V .

If \u2220V, W = 0 then V \u2286 W or W \u2286 V\n6.

However, at least in the\nSL3 (R)/ SO3 (R) case, to get a bound on the Jacobian of Fs one must use\nfurther properties of the measure, as indicated by the example we now give.\nIf for a single flat Fx and a sequence of yi \u2208 Fx , the measures \u03c3ysi tend\nto the sum of Dirac measures 12 \u03b4b+ (\u221e) + 21 \u03b4wb+ (\u221e) where w is in the Weyl\ngroup for Fx , then we claim that Jac Fs (yi ) \u2192 \u221e. First note that the sum\n2\n2\ndB(F\n+ dB(F\n+\n+\ns (yi ),b (\u221e))\ns (yi ),wb (\u221e))\n\nhas only a 3-dimensional kernel, while\nDdB(Fs (yi ),b+ (\u221e)) + DdB(Fs (yi ),wb+ (\u221e))\nhas a 2-dimensional kernel. Furthermore\nZ\nZ\n2\ns\ndB(Fs (yi ),\u03b8) d\u03c3yi and Q2 =\nQ1 =\n\u2202F X\n\n\u2202F X\n\nDdB(Fs (yi ),\u03b8) d\u03c3ysi\n\ndegenerate in the same way, so that det(Q1 )/ det(Q2 )2 is unbounded. This\ncan be easily verified explicitly in the case of a sum of five Dirac measures\nfor which both integrals are nonsingular degenerating to the sum of the two\nDirac measures given above.\nA similar problem occurs when there are H2 factors.\n\n5\n\nProof of the Eigenvalue Matching Theorem\n\nIn order to prove Theorem 4.4 we will need a series of lemmas.\n\n5.1\n\nDimension inequalities\n\nFor any x \u2208 X and any subspace V \u2286 Tx X, denote by KV the elements of\nK which stabilize V (i.e. leave V invariant). For V \u2282 F, if FixK (V ) is the\nsubgroup of K which fixes V pointwise then KV = U * FixK (V ) where U is\nthe subgroup stabilizing V of the (discrete) Weyl group which stabilizes F\n(see [Eb]).\nThe following lemma is a basic algebraic ingredient in the proof of Theorem 4.4.\n\n24\n\n\fLemma 5.1 (Dimension inequality, I). With the above notations,\n\u0011\n\u0010\ndim span{KV * F}\u22a5 \u2265 2 dim(V ).\nProof. First we show that KV * F is itself a subspace hence equal to its\nspan.\nRecognize that KV * F is the union of all tangent spaces to flats which\ncontain V . Pick a basis v1 , . . . , vl of V note that KV * F = \u2229li=1 F(vi ) where\nF(vi ) is the union of all the tangent spaces to flats containing vi using the\nnotation of [Eb]. Proposition 2.11.4 of [Eb] states that F(vi ) = Rr \u00d7 Xi for\nsome symmetric space of noncompact type and r \u2264 rank(X). In particular\nit is a manifold and the tangent space to it corresponds to Kvi * F, which is\na vector space. Then KV * F is a vector space.\nLet KF be the stabilizer of F in K. Then KF \u2282 W * KV where W\ndenotes the Weyl group (a finite group). Hence dim KF = dim(KF \u2229 KV ).\nHence\ndim KV * F = dim KV + dim F \u2212 dim KF\nSince X = K * F we obtain\ndim M = dim K + dim F \u2212 dim KF .\nPutting this together we obtain,\n(dim span{KV * F })\u22a5 = dim M \u2212 dim KV * F = dim K \u2212 dim KV .\n\u22c4\n\nBut Lemma 5.2 below gives that this final term is \u2265 2 dim V , as desired.\n\nThe following lemma was used in the proof of Lemma 5.1. Recall that,\nat this point, we are assuming that the symmetric space X is irreducible\nand has rank(X) \u2265 2.\nLemma 5.2 (Dimension inequality, II). Assume that X 6= SL3 (R)/ SO3 (R).\nThen for any subspace V \u2282 F, we have\ndim K \u2265 2 dim V + dim KV .\nThis lemma is the only place where X 6= SL3 (R)/ SO3 (R) is used.\nProof. For a root \u03b1 \u2208 \u039b in F, define k\u03b1 = (Id +\u03b8p )g\u03b1 , where \u03b8p is the\nCartan involution at p = Fs (y). Then by Proposition 2.14.2 of [Eb] we have\nthat k\u03b1 = g\u03b1 \u2295 g\u2212\u03b1 \u2229 k, k\u03b1 = k\u2212\u03b1 , and dim k\u03b1 \u2265 1.\n25\n\n\fNote that from the definition of g\u03b1 it follows immediately that\nk\u03b1 = {Y \u2208 k|[X, Y ] = 0 for all X \u2208 ker \u03b1}.\nNote that in G the normalizer mod centralizer is finite for any flat subspace. Therefore for any V \u2282 F we may write the Lie algebra kV of KV\nas,\nkV = {Y \u2208 k|[X, Y ] = 0 for all X \u2208 V }.\nIt then follows from the previous statements that,\nX\nkV = k0 +\nk\u03b1 .\n\u03b1\u2208\u039b\n\nV \u2282ker \u03b1\n\nConsequently, we may assume that V in the statement of the lemma\nis maximally singular: V may be written as the intersection of the kernels\nof the greatest number of roots among all subspaces of dimension dim V .\nOtherwise dim KV = dim kV is strictly smaller than it would be if V were\nmaximally singular.\nRecall that we have the invariant inner product \u03c6p on a and hence on F.\nLet \u039b denote the collection of roots. For \u03b1 \u2208 \u039b, let H\u03b1 \u2208 F denote the dual\nroot vector (with respect to \u03c6p ) corresponding to \u03b1. For any subset V \u2282 F\nwe define the function\ncardR (V ) :=\n\n1\ncard{\u03b1 \u2208 \u039b|H\u03b1 \u2208 V }.\n2\n\nSince root vectors lying in a subspace always come in opposing pairs, cardR\nis a positive integer.\nLet \u03b1 be any root. Note that if a subspace V \u2282 ker \u03b1, then H\u03b1 lies in\nV \u22a5 . Therefore the statement of the lemma reduces to showing that\nX\nX\ndim k0 +\ndim k\u03b1 \u2265 2 dim V + dim k0 +\ndim k\u03b1 ,\n\u03b1\u2208\u039b\n\nor more simply,\n\n\u03b1\u2208\u039b\n\nV \u2282ker \u03b1\n\nX\n\nH\u03b1 \u2208F\\V\n\n\u22a5\n\ndim k\u03b1 \u2265 2 dim V.\n\n\u22a5\n\nSwapping V for V and vice versa, and using dim k\u03b1 \u2265 1 for each \u03b1, it\nis sufficient to prove that\ncardR (F \\ V ) \u2265 2(rank(X) \u2212 dim V ).\n26\n\n(6)\n\n\fSince we are assuming that G is simple, we could check this condition by\nusing a classification of root vectors in the simple algebras such as in [Va].\nHowever, because this would be tedious we will instead give a synthetic\nproof.\nFor each i = 0, . . . , rank(X), we say that Wi \u2282 F is a maximally rooted\nsubspace of dimension i if\ncardR (Wi ) = max{cardR (V ) : V \u2282 F with dim V = i}.\nIn other words, Wi is maximally rooted if Wi\u22a5 is maximally singular. We\nclaim that if 0 = W0 , W1 , . . . , Wrank(X) = F are any maximally rooted\nsubspaces of F with dim Wi = i, then for 0 < i \u2264 rank(X),\ncardR (Wi ) \u2265 i + cardR (Wi\u22121 )\n\n(7)\n\nThis is true for i = 1 since W1 is one dimensional it contains a root\nvector pair and the trivial subspace W0 contains none. By induction, assume\nthe claim holds for all maximally rooted subspace Wi of dimension i < j.\nIn particular, for such a space Wj\u22121 and for any subspace Z \u2282 Wj\u22121 of\ncodimension one, cardR (Z) \u2264 cardR (Wj\u22122 ) so\ncardR (Wj\u22121 \\ Z) = cardR (Wj\u22121 ) \u2212 cardR (Z) \u2265 j \u2212 1.\nWe claim that there exists a root vector H\u03b1 which is not in Wj\u22121 or its\n\u22a5\nperpendicular Wj\u22121\n(with respect to \u03c6p ). If not, then every root vector\n\u22a5 which implies the root system is reducible (e.g.\neither lies in Wj\u22121 or Wj\u22121\nCorollary 27.5 of [Hu2]), and hence G is reducible, contrary to assumption.\nTherefore, H\u03b1\u22a5 \u2229 Wj\u22121 is a codimension one subspace of Wj\u22121 and by\ninductive hypothesis there are at least j \u2212 1 distinct pairs of root vectors\n\u00b1H\u03b11 , . . . , \u00b1H\u03b1j\u22121 in Wj\u22121 \\ (H\u03b1\u22a5 \u2229 Wj\u22121 ). For each of these we have\n\u03c6p (H\u03b1 , H\u03b1l ) 6= 0. By the standard calculus of roots (e.g. Proposition 2.9.3\nof [Eb]) this implies that for each 1 \u2264 l \u2264 j \u22121 either \u00b1(H\u03b1 +H\u03b1l ) or \u00b1(H\u03b1 \u2212\nH\u03b1l ) is a pair of root vectors lying in Wj\u22121 \u2295hH\u03b1 i which does not lie in Wj\u22121 .\nIncluding H\u03b1 , these form at least j pairs of root vectors which are contained\nin Wj\u22121 \u2295 hH\u03b1 i \\ Wj\u22121 . Therefore cardR (Wj\u22121 \u2295 hH\u03b1 i) \u2265 cardR (Wj\u22121 ) + j.\nSince by definition of Wj , cardR (Wj ) \u2265 cardR (Wj\u22121 \u2295 hH\u03b1 i), the claim\nfollows.\nRecursively applying Equation 7 shows that for 0 \u2264 i < j \u2264 rank(X),\ncardR (Wj ) \u2212 cardR (Wi ) \u2265\n\nj\nX\nk=i\n\n27\n\nk=\n\nj(j + 1) i(i + 1)\n\u2212\n.\n2\n2\n\n\fNow to prove the inequality (6), as noted before we may assume V of\ndimension q is maximally rooted, since then V \u22a5 is maximally singular. Since\nF is a maximally rooted space, the above expression reads\ncardR (F \\ V ) = cardR (F) \u2212 cardR (V ) =\n\nrank(X)(rank(X) + 1) q(q + 1)\n\u2212\n.\n2\n2\n\nThis is readily seen to be greater that 2(rank(X)\u2212q) unless rank(X) = 2\nand q = 0 (V = F). However, every irreducible Lie algebras of rank two\nother than sl(3, R) has at least four pairs of roots (see [Hu1], p.44, Figure\n1), and hence the inequality (6) is satisfied in all of the required cases. \u22c4\n\n5.2\n\nAngle inequalities\n\nLemma 5.3 (Angle inequality, I). For any subspace V \u2286 F there is a\nsubspace V \u2032 \u2282 V \u22a5 with dim V \u2032 \u2265 2 dim V and a constant C depending only\non the symmetric space X such that for all k \u2208 K,\n\u2220(kV \u2032 , F \u22a5 ) \u2264 C\u2220(kV, F)\nwhere kV represents the linear (derivative) action of K on V \u2282 Tx X.\nProof. For any subspace V \u2282 F, let U1 , U2 , . . . , Ul(V ) be the maximally\nsingular subspaces of dimension dim V which have minimal angle with V .\nDefine SV = U1 \u2295 . . . \u2295 Ul(V ) \u2282 F. If G(r, F) denotes the Grassmann variety\nof subspaces in F with dimension r, then the set of V \u2208 G(r, F) for which\nl(V ) is constant has codimension l(V ) \u2212 1 in G(r, F).\nFor any subspace V \u2282 F we define a subspace V \u2032 \u2282 F \u22a5 by\nV \u2032 = (span{KSV * F})\u22a5\nwhere KSV is the subgroup of K which stabilizes SV . By Proposition 5.1,\nV \u2032 has dimension at least 2 dim V since we always have KSV \u2282 KU for some\nU \u2282 F with dim U = dim V .\nIf no such constant C as in the lemma exists then there is a sequence\nki \u2208 K and Vi \u2282 F with dim Vi = r such that\n\u2220(ki Vi , F)\n\u2192 0.\n\u2220(ki Vi\u2032 , F \u22a5 )\n\n28\n\n(8)\n\n\fNow since SV and hence V \u2032 varies upper semicontinuously in V (thinking\nof the map V \u2192 V \u2032 as a self-map of G(r, F)), it follows from the continuity\nof the \u2220 function that\n\u2220(k V, F)\n\u2220(k V \u2032 , F \u22a5 )\n\nis lower semicontinuous in V .\nHowever since both K and G(r, F) are compact, for some subsequence of\nthe ki Vi , the ki converge to k0 \u2208 K and the Vi converge to a fixed subspace\nV0 \u2282 F. Furthermore, k0 V0 lies in F since \u2220(k0 V0 , F) must be 0. It follows\nthat k0 \u2208 W * KV0 where W is the Weyl group stabilizing F.\nBy construction, KV0 \u2282 KV0\u2032 and for any w \u2208 W ,\n\u2220(wV0\u2032 , F \u22a5 ) = \u2220(V0\u2032 , w\u22121 F \u22a5 ) = \u2220(V0\u2032 , F \u22a5 ).\n\nTherefore, we also have \u2220(k0 V0\u2032 , F \u22a5 ) = 0. Continuity of \u2220 along with\nthe fact that W \u2282 K acts isometrically implies that it is sufficient to show\nthat for any fixed subspace V \u2282 F the quantity\nlim inf\nk\u2192KV\n\n\u2220(kV, F)\n\u2220(kV \u2032 , F \u22a5 )\n\nis bounded away from 0. Note that since this quantity is lower semicontinuous in V , and since G(r, F) is compact, it is unnecessary to show that the\nbound is independent of V .\nFirst we handle the denominator. Using the bi-invariance of the metric\non SO(n), the properties of the angle function, and the fact that for all\nk0 \u2208 KSV we have k0 k k\u22121 F \u2282 KSV F, it follows that\ndSO(n) (k, KSV ) = dSO(n) (k\u22121 , KSV ) = dSO(n) (KSV * k, Id)\n\n\u2265 inf{dSO(n) (Id, P ) : P \u2208 SO(n) with P k \u22121 F \u2282 KSV F}\n\n= \u2220({KSV F}, k\u22121 F)\n\n= \u2220(kKSV F, F)\n\u0011\n\u0010\n= \u2220 (kKSV F)\u22a5 , F \u22a5\n\n= \u2220(kV \u2032 , F \u22a5 )\n\nSo it remains to show that for any sequence ki \u2192 kV \u2208 KV in any fixed\nneighborhood U of KV , that \u2220(ki V, F) \u2265 CdSO(n) (ki , KSV ). Furthermore,\n29\n\n\fsince \u2220(ki V, F) = \u2220(ki (kiV )\u22121 V, F) for any kiV \u2208 KV , we may assume that\nki \u2192 Id.\nBy Theorem 2.10.1 of [Va], in a sufficiently small neighborhood of Id\nS\nS\nwe may uniquely write ki as ki = exp(k\u22a5\ni ) exp(ki ) where ki \u2208 kSV0 and\nS\n\u22a5\n\u22a5\nk\u22a5\ni \u2208 kSV . Furthermore ki \u2192 0 and ki \u2192 0.\n0\n\n\u03c0\nBi-invariance of the metric on SO(n) implies that for |k\u22a5\ni | < 2,\n\u22a5\ndSO(n) (ki , KSV ) = dSO(n) (exp(k\u22a5\ni ), KSV ) = |ki |.\n\nNow KV is the only subgroup of K which both leaves V in F and also\nintersects all sufficiently small neighborhoods of the identity. Therefore, in\norder to show that \u2220(ki V, F) \u2265 C|k\u22a5\ni |, we need only show that\ndSO(n) (ki , KV )/|ki\u22a5 | 6\u2192 0\nWell, the Cambell-Baker-Hausdorff formula implies that\n\u0010\n\u0011\nS\n\u22a5\nS\n\u22a5\nS\nexp(k\u22a5\n)\nexp(k\n)\n=\nexp\nk\n+\nk\n+\nO(|k\n|\n*\n|k\n|)\n.\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\n\nSince the definition of SV implies that kSV \u2283 kV and k\u22a5\ni is perpendicular to\nkSV , we have\n\u22a5\nS\ndSO(n) (ki , KV ) \u2265 |k\u22a5\ni | + O(|ki | * |ki |).\nSince we had |kSi | \u2192 0 this finishes the lemma.\n\u22c4\nLemma 5.4 (Angle inequality, II). For any subspace V of Tx X with dim V \u2264\nrank(X), there is a subspace V \u2032 \u22a5 V with dim V \u2032 \u2265 2 dim V , and a constant\nC depending only on n, such that\n\u2220(kV \u2032 , F \u22a5 ) \u2264 C\u2220(kV, F)\n\nfor all k \u2208 K\n\nProof. The first step of the proof is to reduce to the case when V is a\nsubspace of F, so that Lemma 5.3 may be applied.\nWe first observe that the lemma is true if and only if it is true with V\nreplaced by k0 V for any fixed k0 \u2208 K. Since K is compact we may therefore\nchoose V among all kV, k \u2208 K so that \u2220(V, F) \u2264 \u2220(kV, F) for all k \u2208 K.\nWith this assumption, consider the projection W = \u03c0F (V ) of V onto F.\nBy Lemma 5.3, we obtain a subspace W \u2032 such that\n\u2220(kW \u2032 , F \u22a5 ) \u2264 C\u2220(kW, F)\n30\n\n\ffor all k \u2208 K. Then we let V \u2032 be the projection of W \u2032 onto V \u22a5 . By the\nproperties of the angle function (see 4.4), it follows that\n\u2220(kV \u2032 , F \u22a5 ) \u2264 \u2220(kW \u2032 , F \u22a5 ) + \u2220(kV \u2032 , kW \u2032 ) by Lemma 4.3\n\u2264 C\u2220(kW \u2032 , F \u22a5 ) + \u2220(V \u2032 , W \u2032 )\n\u2264 C\u2220(kW, F) + \u2220(V \u2032 , W \u2032 )\n\nsince (W \u22a5 )\u22a5 \u2287 W\n\n\u2264 C\u2220(kW, F) + \u2220V, F\n\nfor same reason\n\n= C\u2220(kW, F) + \u2220(V, F)\n\nsince W = \u03c0F (V )\n\nThus it suffices to bound \u2220(kW, F) by a constant times \u2220(kV, F). But\n\u2220(kW, F) \u2264 \u2220(kV, F) + \u2220(kV, kW ) by Lemma 4.3\n= \u2220(kV, F) + \u2220(V, W )\n= \u2220(kV, F) + \u2220(V, F)\n\nas W = \u03c0F (V )\n\n\u2264 \u2220(kV, F) + \u2220(kV, F)\n\nby minimality\n\n= 2\u2220(kV, F)\nand we are done. \u22c4\n\n5.3\n\nFinishing the proof of the Eigenvalue Matching Theorem\n\nArmed with the lemmas of the previous two subsections, we now prove\nTheorem 4.4.\nWe begin by noting that the construction of V \u2032 from V above respects\nsubspace inclusion. I.e. if U \u2282 V then U \u2032 \u2282 V \u2032 . This follows from the\ndefinition of V \u2032 and the fact that for two singular subspaces U1 and U2 with\nU1 \u2282 U2 , we have KU1 * (W \u2229 KU2 ) \u2283 KU2 , where W is the Weyl group.\nNow we simply proceed by induction on the number of vectors k. For\nk = 1 we set V = v1 the statement of the proposition follows from Lemma\n5.4. Order the vectors by increasing angle with F. Assume the proposition\nfor k \u2212 1 vectors, then set Vk = span{v1 , * * * , vk }. By Lemma 5.4 we have\nan orthogonal subspace of twice the dimension of Vk , namely Vk\u2032 , which we\n31\n\n\f\u2032\n\u2295 W \u2032 where W \u2032 is two\nmay write by the preceeding paragraph as Vk\u2032 = Vk\u22121\ndimensional. The same lemma also guarantees that \u2220W \u2032 , F \u22a5 \u2264 C\u2220vk , F,\nsince \u2220vk , F = \u2220Vk , F.\nThis completes the proof of Theorem 4.4.\n\n6\n\nFinishing the proof of the Degree Theorem\n\nWe will break the proof of Theorem 1.1 into the compact and noncompact\ncases.\n\n6.1\n\nThe compact case\n\nSuppose M and N are compact. Since for s > h(g), Fs is a C 1 map, using\nProposition 3.2 and elementary integration theory yields,\nZ\nR\n|deg(f )| Vol(M ) = |deg(f )| M dg0 =\nf \u2217 dg0\nN\nR\n= N Fs\u2217 dg0\n\u0013n\n\u0012\nR\ns\nVol(N )\n\u2264 N |Jac Fs | dg \u2264 C\nh(g0 )\n\n(9)\n\nFor the last inequality we have used the principal estimate from Theorem 4.1. Rearranging terms gives us \u0010the inequality\nin Theorem 1.1 since\n\u0011n\ns\ndepends only on n and the\nC depends only on the dimension and h(g0 )\nsmallest Ricci curvatures of M and N .\n\n6.2\n\nThe noncompact case\n\nWe now consider the case when N (and/or M ) has finite volume but is not\ncompact. In this setting, it is not known whether the limit in the definition\nof h(g) always exists. For this reason we will define the quantity h(g) to be\n\u001a\n\u001b\nZ\nh(g) = inf s \u2265 0 \u2203C > 0 such that \u2200y \u2208 Y,\ne\u2212sd(y,z) dg(z) < C .\nY\n\nIn fact this agrees with the previous definition for h(g) when N is compact.\nIn the case of the symmetric space (M, g0 ) this definition of h(g0 ) agrees\nwith the previous definition for compact manifolds.\nFor the finite volume case, the main difficulty is that, in order for the\nproof given above to work, we need to know that Fs is proper (and thus\n32\n\n\fsurjective since deg(Fs ) = deg(f ) 6= 0). For this, we will need to prove\nhigher rank analogs of some lemmas used in [BCS] for the rank one case.\nFor the basics of degree theory for proper maps between noncompact spaces,\nsee [FG]. We will need to assume that the geometry of N is bounded in\nthe sense that its Ricci curvatures are bounded from above and that the\ninjectivity radius of its universal cover Y is bounded from below. These are\nthe specific assumptions implied in the third remark after the theorem.\nWe will show that Fs is proper by essentially showing that the barycenter\nof \u03c3ys lies nearby a convex set containing large mass for this measure. This\nconvex set is in turn far away from \u03c6(p) whenever x is far from p \u2208 Y . We\nachieve this by first estimating the concentration of the mass of \u03c3ys in certain\ncones which will be our convex sets. One difficulty that arises in the higher\nrank is that these cones must have a certain angle when restricted to a flat.\nAnother difficulty is that the ends of M can have large angle at infinity. In\nfact our methods breakdown unless we control the asymptotic expansion of\nf down the ends (see Remarks 6.2).\nFirst, we localize the barycenter of the measure \u03c3ys . Let v(x,\u03b8) be the unit\nvector in Sx X pointing to \u03b8 \u2208 \u2202X.\nLemma 6.1. Let K \u2282 X and y \u2208 Y be such that (\u03c6\u2217 \u03bcsy )(K) > C for some\nconstant 1 > C > 12 . Suppose that for all x \u2208 X there exists v \u2208 Sx X such\nthat for all z \u2208 K:\nZ\n1\nv(x,\u03b8) , v d\u03bdz (\u03b8) \u2265\n\u22121\nC\n\u2202F X\nThen\n\nx 6= Fes (y)\n\nProof.\nIf Fes (y) = x then \u2207x Bs,y (x) = 0. However, \u2207x Bs,y (x) may be\nexpressed as\nZ Z\nv(x,\u03b8) d\u03bdz (\u03b8)d\u03c6\u2217 \u03bcsy (z)\nX\n\n\u2202F X\n\n33\n\n\fwhere v(x,\u03b8) is the unit vector in Sx X pointing to \u03b8 \u2208 \u2202F X. Then we have\nZ Z\nkDx Bs,y k =\nv(x,\u03b8) d\u03bdz (\u03b8)d\u03c6\u2217 \u03bcsy (z)\nX \u2202 X\nZ ZF\n\u2265\nv(x,\u03b8) d\u03bdz (\u03b8)d\u03c6\u2217 \u03bcsy (z) \u2212\nK \u2202F X\nZ\nZ\nv(x,\u03b8) d\u03bdz (\u03b8)d\u03c6\u2217 \u03bcsy (z)\nX\u2212K \u2202F X\nZ Z\nv(x,\u03b8) , v d\u03bdz (\u03b8)d\u03c6\u2217 \u03bcsy (z) \u2212 \u03c6\u2217 \u03bcsy (X \u2212 K)\n\u2265\nK \u2202F X\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\ns\n\u2265 \u03c6\u2217 \u03bcy (K)\n\u2212 1 \u2212 1 + \u03c6\u2217 \u03bcsy (K)\nC\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n>C\n\u22121 \u22121+C =0\nC\nThe strictness of the inequality finishes the proof. \u22c4\nFor v \u2208 SX and \u03b1 > 0 consider the convex cone,\n\b\nE(v,\u03b1) = exp\u03c0(v) w \u2208 T\u03c0(v) X | \u2220\u03c0(v) (v(\u221e), w(\u221e)) \u2264 \u03b1 ,\n\nwhere \u03c0 : T X \u2192 X is the tangent bundle projection.\nDenote by \u2202E(v,\u03b1) \u2282 \u2202X its boundary at infinity.\n\nLemma 6.2. There exists T0 > 0 and \u03b10 > 0 such that for all t \u2265 T0 , all\nx \u2208 X, all v \u2208 Sx X and all z \u2208 E(gt v,\u03b10 ) ,\n\u221a\nZ\n2\n.\nv(x,\u03b8) , v d\u03bdz (\u03b8) \u2265\n3\n\u2202F X\nProof. Since the isometry group of the symmetric space X is transitive on\nX and for any isometry \u03c8, d\u03c8(E(v,\u03b1) ) = E(d\u03c8(v),\u03b1) , it is sufficient to prove\nthe lemma for a fixed x and all v \u2208 Sx X.\nFor now choose \u03b10 < \u03c0/4. Take a monotone sequence ti \u2192 \u221e, and any\nchoice zi \u2208 E(gti v,\u03b1) for each ti . It follows that some subsequence of the zi ,\nwhich we again denote by {zi }, must tend to some point \u03b8 \u2208 \u2202E(v,\u03b1) .\nLet \u03bd\u03b8 be the weak limit of the measures \u03bdzi . From Theorem 2.4, \u03bd\u03b8 is a\nprobability measure supported on a set S\u03b8 satisfying\n\u03c0\n\u2200\u03be \u2208 S\u03b8 .\n\u2220x (\u03b8, \u03be) \u2264\n4\n34\n\n\fTherefore we have,\nZ\n\nv(x,\u03be) , v(x,\u03b8) d\u03bd\u03b8 (\u03be) \u2265\n\nS\u03b8\n\n\u221a\n\n2\n2\n\n(10)\n\nNow whenever \u03b8 \u2208 \u2202E(v,\u03b1) then v = v(x,\u03b8) + \u01ebv \u2032 for some unit vector v \u2032\nand \u01eb \u2264 sin(\u03b1). Using either case above we may write\nZ\nZ\nv(x,\u03be) , v(x,\u03b8) d\u03bd\u03b8 (\u03be) \u2212 sin(\u03b1).\nv(x,\u03be) , v d\u03bd\u03b8 (\u03be) \u2265\n\u2202F X\n\n\u2202F X\n\nSo choosing \u03b1 small enough we can guarantee that\n1. any two Weyl chambers intersecting E(gt v,\u03b1) for all t > 0 in the same\nflat must share a common face of dimension rank(M ) \u2212 1, and\n2. for any \u03b8 \u2208 \u2202E(v,\u03b1) ,\n\nZ\n\n\u2202F X\n\n\u221a\n2\nv(x,\u03be) , v d\u03bd\u03b8 (\u03be) \u2265\n.\n2.5\n\nLet\nE(v(\u221e),\u03b1) = \u2229t>0 \u2202E(gt v,\u03b1) .\nBy the first property used in the choice of \u03b1 above, for any two points\n\u03b81 , \u03b82 \u2208 E(v(\u221e),\u03b1) , either \u03b81 and \u03b82 are in the boundary of the same Weyl\nchamber, or else there is another point \u03b8 \u2032 in the intersection of the boundaries\nat infinity of the closures of the respective Weyl chambers.\nBy maximality there is some \u03b80 \u2208 E(v(\u221e),\u03b1) intersecting the boundary\nat infinity of the closure of every Weyl chamber which intersects E(gt v,\u03b1) for\nall t > 0. Hence, for every \u03b8 \u2208 E(v(\u221e),\u03b1) , the support of the limit measure\n\u03bd\u03b8 satisfies S\u03b8 \u2282 S\u03b80 . (While \u03b80 is not necessarily unique, the support S\u03b80\nof the corresponding limit measure \u03bd\u03b80 is.)\nAs t increases, for any z \u2208 E(gt v,\u03b1) , the measures \u03bdz uniformly become\nincreasingly concentrated on S\u03b80 . Then applying the estimate (10) to \u03b8 = \u03b80 ,\nwe may choose T0 sufficiently large so that for all z \u2208 E(gt v,\u03b1) with t > T0 ,\n\u221a\nZ\n2\n.\nv(x,\u03be) , v d\u03bdz (\u03be) \u2265\n3\n\u2202F X\n\u22c4\nProposition 6.3. Fs is proper.\n35\n\n\fProof. By way of contradiction, let yi \u2208 Y be an unbounded sequence\nsuch that {Fes (yi )} lies in a compact set K. We may pass to an unbounded\nsubsequence of {yi }, which we again denote as {yi }, such that the sequence\n\u03c6(yi ) converges within a fundamental domain for \u03c01 (M ) in X to a point\n\u03b80 \u2208 \u2202X. Since K is compact, the set\n\\\nA=\nE(gT0 v(x,\u03b8 ) ,\u03b10 )\n0\n\nx\u2208K\n\ncontains an open neighborhood of \u03b80 and dX (A, K) \u2265 T0 . Notice that A is\nitself a cone, being the intersection of cones on a nonempty subset of \u2202X.\nWe now show that A contains the image \u03c6(B(yi , Ri )) of increasingly\nlarge balls (Ri \u2192 \u221e). However, we observe from the fact that A is a cone\non an open neighborhood of \u03b80 in \u2202X that A contains balls B(\u03c6(yi ), ri ) with\nri \u2192 \u221e. By assumption f , and hence \u03c6, is coarsely Lipschitz:\ndX (\u03c6x, \u03c6y) \u2264 KdY (x, y) + C\nfor some constants C > 0 and K \u2265 1. Therefore \u03c6\u22121 (B(\u03c6(yi ), ri )) \u2283\nB(yi , Ri ) where KRi + C > ri . In particular Ri \u2192 \u221e.\nHence, there exists an unbounded sequence Ri such that B(yi , Ri ) \u2282\n\u22121\n\u03c6 (A). Furthermore, since the Ricci curvature is assumed to be bounded\nfrom above and the injectivity radius from below, we have that\nVol(B(yi , injrad))\nR\nis greater than some constant independent of yi and hence Y e\u2212sd(yi ,z)dg(z) >\nQ for some constant RQ > 0. By choice of s there is a constant Cs depending\nonly on s such that Y e\u2212sd(y,z) dg(z) < Cs for all y \u2208 Y .\nIn polar coordinates we may write,\nZ \u221e\nZ\n\u2212sd(y,z)\ne\u2212st Vol(S(y, t))dt\ne\ndg(z) =\n0\nY\nZ \u221e\nd\ne\u2212st Vol(B(y, t))dt\n=\ndt\n0\nZ \u221e\nd \u2212st \u0001\ne\nVol(B(y, t))dt\n=\u2212\ndt\n0\nZ \u221e\ne\u2212st Vol(B(y, t))dt.\n=s\n0\n\n36\n\n\fUsing this we may estimate, using any \u03b4 < s \u2212 h(g),\n\n\u03bcsyi (\u03c6\u22121 (A)) > \u03bcsyi (B(yi , Ri ))\nR \u221e \u2212st\ne Vol(B(yi , t))dt\n= 1 \u2212 RR\u221ei \u2212st\nVol(B(yi , t))dt\n0 e\nR \u221e \u2212(s\u2212\u03b4)t\n\u2212\u03b4R\ni\ne\nVol(B(yi , t))dt\nRi e\nR\u221e\n\u22651\u2212\n\u2212st Vol(B(y , t))dt\ni\n0 e\nC\ns\u2212\u03b4\n.\n\u2265 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b4Ri\nQ\nTherefore for all sufficiently large i,\n3\n\u221a .\n\u03bcsyi (\u03c6\u22121 (A)) >\n3+ 2\n3\u221a\nis the constant C from Lemma\n3+ 2\nT\n+1\n0\ng\nv(Fes (yi ),\u03b80 ) .

In the proof of the above proposition, we used that injrad is bounded\nfrom below and Ricci curvature is bounded from above only to show\nthat the volume of balls of any fixed radius are bounded from below.\n2. Ideas from coarse topology can be used to remove the coarse lipschitz\nassumption on f in the case that the ends of M have angle at infinity\nbounded away from \u03c0/2. However, M may have ends containing pieces\nof flats with wide angle (consider the product of two rank one manifolds\neach with multiple cusps, or for a complete classification of higher rank\nends see [Ha]). For such spaces it is possible to construct a proper map\nf : M \u2192 M such that for a radial sequence yi \u2192 \u221e, \u03c6 maps the bulk\nof the mass of \u03bcsyi into a set (almost) symmetrically arranged about\nthe point p \u2208 X thus keeping Fes (yi ) bounded. This explains the need\nfor a condition on f akin to the coarse lipschitz hypothesis.\n\nThe inequality in Theorem 1.1 now follows as in the compact case, with\ndeg(f ) and deg(Fs ) suitably interpreted.\n37\n\n\fReferences\n[Al]\n\nP.
