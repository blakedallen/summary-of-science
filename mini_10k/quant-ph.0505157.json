Great progress has been\nmade in this novel region [3]; The original adiabatic condition in Berry's work has been removed by Aharonov\nand Anandan [4], and Samuel and Bhandari have generalized the geometric phase by extending to noncyclic evolution and sequential measurements [5]. At the same time a\nkinematic approach to the theory of the geometric phase\nhas also been developed by Mukunda and Simon [6]. Recently the generalization to mixed states was conducted\nfirst by Uhlmann in the mathematical context of purification [7], and then by Sj\u00f6qvist et al. based on the MachZender interferometer [8]. Consequently the mixed-state\ngeometric phase has been experimentally verified using\nboth NMR interferometry [9] and single photon interferometry [10]. Recently the geometric phase for mixed\nstate was put forward by Singh et al. for the case of degenerate density operators [11] and a general formula for\nthe parallel transporting was also provided. Despite the\ngreat progress in this field, Bhandari recently raised the\ncriticism that the definition for geometric phase in mixed\nstate fails when the interference fringes disappear [12].\nThis can be explained as the disappearance (appearance)\nof the geometric phase (off-diagonal geometric phase).\nThe definition of off-diagonal geometric phase(OP) was\nfirst given by Manini et al. for pure states in adiabatic\nevolutions[13], and then was generalized to non-adiabatic\nsituation[14] and in mixed-states[15]. Moreover the offdiagonal geometric phase was studied in degenerate case\n[16]and in bipartite systems[17]. Recently the effect of entanglement on the off-diagonal geometric phase has also\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 URL:\n\naddress: cuiht@student.dlut.edu.cn\nhttp://qpi.dlut.edu.cn\n\ndiscussed [18].\nThe quantum computation scheme for the geometric\nphase has been proposed based on the Abelian [19] or\nnon-Abelian geometric phase [20], in which geometric\nphase has been shown to be intrinsic against faults in the\npresence of some kind of external noise due to the geometric nature of Berry phase. Consequently the quantum\ngates based on geometric phase have also been proposed\nin different systems [21], where the interactions play an\nimportant role for the realization of some specific operations.\nBipartite system is of great importance in quantum\ncomputation, such as the transfer of quantum information, the construction of entanglement as well as the realizations of logic operations. Furthermore, it was found\nthat GPs may be used to design quantum logic gates.\nThese facts together give rise to a question what are the\ngeometric phase and its motion in bipartite systems. Recently some papers have addressed this issue [22, 23],\nwhere the discussions respectively focus on the entanglement dependence of the geometric phase for subsystem and the coupling effect on the GP for subsystem\nunder adiabatical evolution. However, another question\nremains open; how the entanglement or interaction affects the geometric phase for the whole system. This\nconsideration is not trivial since any quantum information procession cannot implemented by only one qubit.\nMoreover some interesting results may be found with the\nincrement of the size of the system. In this paper, focusing on the entanglement and inter-subsystem couplings,\nwe present explicit discussion on the geometric phases in\nbipartite systems.\nFor this purpose, our discussion is divided into several\nsections. In Sec. II, we describe the model to be discussed in this paper and some formulas are also present\nfor the calculation of the geometric phase. Then in Sec.\nIII we study the geometric phase for two noninteracting\nparticles and some interesting results can be found in this\nsection. The intra-subsystem coupling effect on the geometric phase is studied in Sec. IV. Finally, conclusions\nare given at the end of this paper.\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nMODEL\n\nIn order to highlight the effect of the entanglement, we\nchoose the initial state as\n\u03c1(0) =\n\n1\u2212r\nI + r|\u03a6ih\u03a6|,\n4\n\n(1)\n\nwhere r \u2208 (0, 1] determines the mixing of this state and I\nis the unit matrix in the 2 \u00d7 2 Hilbert space. Notice that\nfor r = 0 Eq. (1) is the unit matrix and its geometric\nphase is trivial (always be zero), our discussion excludes\nthis case. The state |\u03a6i may be either of the following\nstates,\n|\u03c6i = sin \u03b8|11i1,2 + cos \u03b8|00i1,2\n|\u03c8i = sin \u03b8|10i1,2 + cos \u03b8|01i1,2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b8 determines the degree of entanglement and\n|1(0)ii (i = 1, 2) is the eigenstate of Pauli operator \u03c3z .\nOne should note that when \u03b8 = (3)\u03c0/4, the equations\nabove are Bell states and Eq.(1) are the Werner states\n[24], which plays an important role in quantum information processings, especially in quantum communication\nvia noisy channels [25] and quantum distillation [26]. In\ngeneral the mixed state Eq. (1), which first was introduced by Wootters [27], may be entangled; that can be\njudged by the Peres-Horodecki condition [28]. Eq. (1) includes all possible cases, such as pure or mixed state and\nmaximal or non-maximal entangled states. One should\nnote that Eq. (1) is triplet-degenerate for r 6= 1.\nWe should point out that the initial state Eq. (1) is not\na trivial generalizing from the pure case. The first term in\nEq. (1) can be regarded as the noise and the mixing coefficient r properly describe the intensity of noise. Recently\nthe one-to-one correspondence between r of Werner state\nand the temperature T of the one-dimensional Heisenberg two-spin chain with a magnetic field B along the\nz-axis, has been established [29]. This connection gives\nus the strong physical support for the initial state Eq.\n(1).\nWe choose the system composed of two spin-1/2 particles undergoing spin procession in an external time independent magnetic field in the z direction. Then the\nHamiltonian is\nH = H 0 + HI ,\n\n(3)\n\nin which the free Hamiltonian H0 and the XX interaction\nHI are respectively\nH0 = \u03c91 S1z + \u03c92 S2z\nHI =\n\ng(S1\u2020 S2\u2212\n\n+\n\nS1\u2212 S2\u2020 ),\n\n(4)\n\nwhere g > 0 is the antiferromagnetism coupling constant\nand Siz (i = 1, 2) is the z component of spin operator respectively. Si\u00b1 = Six + iSiy (i = 1, 2) are the raising and\ndecreasing operators of the z component of spin-1/2. Actually the Hamiltonian Eq. (3) is two-qubit XX model,\n\nwhich is of fundamental importance to understand the\nrelation between the entanglement and quantum correlation in interacting many-body systems. In general we\nsuppose that \u03c91 may not be equal to \u03c92 because of the\ninhomogeneity of the external magnetic field. One will\nfind in the following discussion that the inhomogeneity of\nthe external magnetic field has nontrivial effect on GP.\nSome formulas should be addressed for the calculation\nof GP in this model. Recently GP for the mixed state\nhas been discussed by Sj\u00f6qvist et al.in [8], based on the\nMach-Zender interferometer and a formula was provided\nfor calculation of GP for a mixed state,\n\u03b3g = ArgTr[U k (t)\u03c1(0)],\n\n(5)\n\nin which U k (t) was defined as the parallel transportation\noperator. Based on this work, Singh, et al., [11] studied\nGP for non-degenerate and degenerate mixed states and\nprovided a general method for the construction of U k (t)\nby imposing\nU k (t) = U (t)V (t)\n\n(6)\n\nin which U (t) is the unitary evolution operator and is\nequal to e\u2212iHt in our model and V (t) is a blocked matrix,\nof which the elements are determined by\n\u2032\n\nP\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nV\u03bc\u03bd = h\u03bc|eit \u03bc\u2032 ,\u03bd \u2032 h\u03bc |H|\u03bd i|\u03bc ih\u03bd | |\u03bdi,\n|\u03bci, |\u03bdi, |\u03bc\u2032 i, |\u03bd \u2032 i \u2208 {degenerate subspace}\nVkk = eihk|H|kit , |ki \u2208 {the remaining space},\n\n(7)\n\nwhere |\u03bci, |\u03bdi, |\u03bc\u2032 i, |\u03bd \u2032 i, |ki are the eigenstates of \u03c1(0),\nand the interference terms between the degenerate space\nand the other space are set to be zero in order to keep the\nparallel transporting in the degenerate space.

The dotted, dashed, longer-dashed and solid\nlines correspond respectively to n = 0.99, 0.9, 0.5, 0. When\nn = 1, the geometric phase is not discontinued at the point\n\u03b8 = \u03c0/4. (b) is for \u03c12 and the other parameters are the same\nas that of Fig. 1(b). The dotted, dashed and solid lines correspond to n = 0.5, 0.1, 0.01. When n = 0, the geometric phase\nis not discontinued in the point \u03b8 = \u03c0/4. (c) and (d) demonstrate the case that there is no the singularity ( We have\nchosen \u03c91 t = \u03c0/4 for \u03c11 and \u03c91 t = \u03c0/2 for \u03c12 respectively).\n\nIt is interesting to note that when the initial states are\nWerner states, the geometric phase is zero when the denominators in Eqs.(9) are not vanishing simultaneously.\nFurthermore when \u03c91 = \u03c92 , the geometric phase for \u03c12\nis zero since \u03c12 is commutative with the Hamiltonian\nand it cannot pick up any geometric phase. A detailed\ndemonstration for \u03b3gj (j = 1, 2) with the parameters r, \u03b8\n\nWith the consideration of the two noninteracting particles, it is of interest to discuss the effect of the inhomogeneity of the external fields. The results have been\nillustrated in Fig. 2. It clearly shows that when there\nis a singular point, for \u03c11 , the absolute value of the geometric phase with n \u2192 1 attains the maximum closed\nto this point. Whereas, for \u03c12 , this happens for n \u2192 0.\nWe should emphasize that this phenomenon appears only\nwhen there exists the singularity, which is induced by\nthe entanglement of the initial state. If there is no possibility of the appearance of the singularity, our calculation shows that the points where the absolute value of\nthe geometric phase attains the maximum is independent\nof the inhomogeneity of the external field,just shown as\nFig.2(c)and (d) and always is zero for the Werner state.\nPhysically it is thus possible for this phenomenon to act\nas the signature of the singularity of the geometric phase,\nwhich is usually originated from the degenerace [13].\n\nAnother interesting consideration is that one supposes\n\u03c92 = 0, which corresponds to case that particle A is processing with frequency \u03c91 while particle B keep dynamically fixed. In this case, the affect from the dynamics of\nthe second particle is excluded and one can more clearly\ncheck the effect of the entanglement on the geometric\nphase. The geometric phase for this special situation can\nbe obtained by setting \u03c92 = 0 in Eq. (9). One can find\nthat because of the entanglement, the geometric phase\nfor particle 1 is zero too for Werner state. and it is also\npossible for the singularity to appear, for example when\nr = 1 and \u03c91 t = \u03c0.\n\n\f4\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\u03b3g2\n\n0.2\n\nr 0.60.4\n0.8\n\n01\n\n0.2\n-0.1\n0.1\n-0.2\n\n0.2\n0.4\nr 0.60.8\n\n20\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n\n\u03b3g2\n\n0\n0.5\n1\n\nJ\n\n1.5\n\nJ\n\n10\n\n2\n\nFIG. 3: GP for \u03b3g2 [Arc] versus r and rescaled coupling constant J.

Compared with\nthe g = 0 case, we have chosen the Werner states\n(\u03b8 = (3)\u03c0/4) as the initial states and \u03c91 t = 2\u03c92 t = \u03c0\nwith consideration of the inhomogeneity of external magnetic field. Because of the coupling, the geometric phase\nfor the Werner state is obviously very different from the\nfree case. From these figures we also note that GP has\na maximal or mininmal values when the rescaled coupling constant is less than 1. Furthermore, when J > 1\nthe absolute value of GP decrease with the increment of\nJ. One also notes that because of the mixing, which is\nscaled by the parameter r, the absolute values of GP is\ncompressed, which is same as the free case. The effect of\nthe inhomogeneity of magnetic field also discussed. Our\ncalculation shows that with \u03c92 /\u03c91 \u2192 1, the point that\nGP has maximal or minimal value is infinitely closed to\nJ = 0.5 (Fig. 4).\nWe also investigate the GP when one particle in zero\nfield. This case is nontrivial since any system cannot\navoid the affect from the other party. Also it can be used\nto manipulate the behavior of one particle by changing\nof the coupling strength. To this end, we set \u03c92 = 0\nand the geometric phase have been illustrated in Fig. 5.\nDifferent from Fig. 3, the absolute value of GP attains\nthe maximal value when J \u2192 1.\n\n\u03b3g2\n\n01\n-0.05\n-0.1\n-0.15\n-0.2\n0\n\n(10)\nsin \u03bb1 t sin \u03bb1 t)\n\nin which\n\n(b)\n\nr 0.40.2\n0.6\n0.8\n\n0.2\n0.4\nr 0.60.8\n\n0.5\n1\n\nJ\n\n0.2\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n20\n\n1.5\n2\n\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n10\n\nJ\n\nFIG. 5: The geometric phase [Arc]for \u03c12 when \u03c92 = 0 versus\nr, J. Except of \u03c92 = 0, all other settings are the same as in\nFig. 3.\n\nThe interesting extension to this discussion above is in\nthe limit of large J = \u03c9g1 . In this case GP has a novel\ncharacter, which have been displayed in Fig. 6. We note\nthat GP tends to be zero in the limit of large J. This\ncan be understood as that in the limit of large J the\ninteraction HI is dominant in Eq. (3)and the Hamiltonian is inclined to be commutative with the Werner\nstate. Then the entanglement of the initial state tends\nto be unchanged.\nBased on the analysis above, we can conclude that\nbecause of the inter-subsystem couplings, the geometric\nphase shows two different characters; in the weak coupling limit, the interaction obviously benefits the geometric phase, displayed in Fig. 3 and Fig. 5. However,\nwith further increment of the couplings, the GP decreases\nand tends to be zero infinitely. This phenomena can be\nexplained easily only if one note that in the infinite coupling limit, HI is dominant and its eigenstates are just\ntwo of the Bell states. The entanglement is destroyed in\nthe weak couplings limit and then revived by the interaction in the infinite limit. The interesting relation between\nentanglement and interaction between two parties is an\nimportant aspect of quantum information.\n\n\f5\n0.05\n\n0\n\n(b)\n\n-0.01\n\n\u03b3g2\n\n\u03b3g2\n\n0.04 (a)\n0.03\n0.02\n\n-0.02\n-0.03\n\n0.01\n\n-0.04\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nJ\n\n20\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\nJ\n\n15\n\n20\n\nFIG. 6: \u03b3g2 [Arc] in the limit of large J.

(1) in an external magnetic field. For the free case (g = 0), our studies show\nthat because of the entanglement, the geometric phase\nfor the system displays two different types of character.\nThe first is that if there was no singularity, the absolute\nvalue of the geometric phase attains the maximum when\nthe initial state is not the Werner state, independent of\nthe inhomogeneity of the external field (see Fig. 2(c)\nand (d)). Because of the mixing, scaled by r, it is compressed. Furthermore the geometric phase is always zero\nfor the Werner state. The second behavior occurs when\n\n[1] S. Pancharatnam, Proc. Indian Acad.

In this case\nthe geometric phase reaches the maximum with \u03b8 tending to the singular point (see Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 2(a)\nand (b)). We also discuss the situation that one particle\nis processing and another keeps dynamically fixed, and\nsimilar results can be found.\nFor the case g 6= 0, we choose the Werner states as\nthe initial condition for facilitating our discussion. The\nresults show that GP is completely determined by the\nrescaled coupling constant J and attain the maximal or\nminimal value when J < 1. Similar to the free case, we\nalso discussed the effect of the inhomogeneity of the external magnetic field. The results show that for Werner\nstate GP is always zero when system is in a homogeneous\nexternal magnetic field , independent of the interaction.\nFurthermore with \u03c92 /\u03c91 \u2192 1, the absolute value of GP\nattains a maximum at the point J \u2192 0.5. The geometric phase for \u03c92 = 0 is also studied. Further study in\nthe limit of large J displays a novel phenomena that GP\ntends to be zero and this result have been explained as\nthe revival of entanglement in this limit.\nThis work was supported by NSF of China under grant\n10305002 and 60578014.\n\n[18] H.
