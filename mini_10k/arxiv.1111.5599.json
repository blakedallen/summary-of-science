The most used planetary\ndetection methods are radial velocity and transit. Together, both techniques led to the discovery\nof the vast majority of the over 570 planets observed so far (according to the Extra-solar Planets\nEncyclopaedia, http://exoplanet.eu). When the same planet is detected by both methods, the\ncomplete set of planetary and orbital parameters is determined. Two space missions designed to\ndetect planetary transits are operational right now: CoRoT, from the CNES with a consortium of\nmany countries, and Kepler, from NASA.\nOne of the motivations for the search of extra-solar planets is the quest for places suitable for\nthe emergence of life. For this to be possible, the planet needs to be located in a place known as\nthe habitable zone (Huang, S. S. 1959; Kasting et al. 1993). This is the region around the host\nstar, where the radiation received by the planet is such that allows for water to exist in its liquid\nstate. Furthermore, the planet needs to be rocky. Due to the observations bias, the majority of the\nplanets found up to date are gaseous giants, what excludes them from being habitable even if they\nare in the habitable stellar zone.\nThrough observation of the Solar System, we can infer that the existence of moons and planetary rings around gas exoplanets may be common. Also, we can deduce that moons are rocky by\nnature. Planetary rings may exist in very different configurations, from the rarefied rings of Uranus\nto the giant rings of Saturn. The detection of both moons and/or rings may uncover important\nclues about the planet formation and migration process. Moreover, if a gas planet located in the\nstellar habitable zone has moons, these moons may also be habitable, making them a good place\nfor life to evolve.\nSartoretti & Schneider (1999) suggest that exomoons could be detected using photometry.\nThe presence of moons around an exoplanet would cause distortions in the transit light curve, in\nthe form of steps or asymmetries. The detection of these distortions would provide the moon's\norbital parameters. Using this technique and photometric data from the Hubble Space Telescope,\nBrown et al. (2001) searched for moons and rings around the exoplanet HD 209458b. However,\nnothing was found. Kipping (2011) proposes an algorithm capable of generating transit light\ncurves of a planet with a moon analytically, and shows how this can be used on the search for\nmoons using photometry. On the other hand, Han & Han (2002) studied the detection possibility\nusing gravitational micro-lensing events. Williams & Knacke (2004) showed that it is possible to\ndetect moons in orbit of gaseous giant planets in the habitable zone using spectroscopy in the 1.5\n- 5 \u03bcm band. Kipping (2009a,b) suggests that moon detection is possible from the effects on the\nplanet motion, that may be detectable through precise measurements of the timing and duration\nof the transits. These are known as transit time variation (TTV) and transit duration variation\n(TDV).\nBarnes & Fortney (2004) suggest that rings around a Saturn-like exoplanet could be detected\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nwith photometric precision of (1 - 3) \u00d7 10\u22124 and time resolution of 15 minutes, as long as the\nring is not viewed close to edge-on. This resolution is within the accuracy that the Kepler Space\nTelescope can achieve for Sun-like or brighter stars. Ohta et al. (2009) study ring detection through\nphotometry and spectroscopy, and conclude that rings with significantly great inclination can be\ndetected by today radial velocity precision of 1 m/s. Schlichting & Chang (2011) study the nature\nof rings that can exist around exoplanets, and conclude that rings around close-in planets can show\nnon-trivial Laplacian planes. This is caused by the increased effects of the planet's quadrupole\nmoment. These so called warped rings furnish important clues about the planet interior and spin\nperiod.\nDespite all these proposed methods, no exo-moon or planetary rings have been observed so\nfar.\nHere, we propose a model of planetary transit simulation that may be used in the search for\nexo-moons through their signature in the light curve of their host planets. Beside the moons, the\nmodel may also simulate the transit of a planet with a ring around it. The model we propose here\nis capable of generating transit light curves numerically, unlike Kipping (2011). Albeit the larger\nprocessing time needed to fit light curves using this method, it has the advantage of being easily\nadaptable to include new features, as additional moons, changes in the ring plane or starspots. The\ngoal is to apply this model to the observations of the CoRoT and Kepler space telescopes, looking\nfor the photometric signals that may indicate the presence of moons or rings around exoplanets.\nOur model does not consider the detection of the warped rings shown by Schlichting & Chang\n(2011). Such rings are predicted around close-in exoplanets, with orbital period of a few days.\nThus, our model is limited to the detection of rings located in the planet's equatorial plane, with\nlarger semi-major axis. As the occurance of such warped rings depends on the quadrupole moment\nJ2 and on the density of the planet, it is difficult to stablish a general criterion to the validity of our\nmodel. For example, for the case of an exoplanet with density 3 g cm\u22123 and J2 = 10\u22122 , warped rings\noccur for semi-major axis below 0.05 AU (see Figure 6 on Schlichting & Chang (2011)). Planets\nwith larger semi-major axis will have rings located in the planet equatorial plane and could be\ndetected by our model.\nThe next section describes the model used in this work, whereas Section 3 presents the application of this model to a few study cases. Section 4 discusses the detectability threshold of moon\nand ring systems. Finally, the last section lists our main conclusions.\n\n2.\n\nThe model\n\nThe model used here is based on that of Silva (2003), where the star is considered a disc with\nlimb darkening and the planet a completely dark disc. Both stellar and planetary parameters can\nbe fit by the model. To minimize the number of free parameters, we consider a simple model where\nthe moon's orbit is coplanar with the planetary one, and is also circular. Looking at the Solar\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nSystem's moons, we see that these assumptions are a little limiting. However, as this is our first\nstudy on the detection of moons, we choose to consider the simplest model. In a future work we\ncan consider a more realistic model, including orbital inclinations and eccentricity for the moon.\nRegarding to the planet eccentricity, following the strategy proposed by Kipping (2008), the model\nsimulates eliptical orbits only for the cases were eccentricity was measured by other methods, such\nas radial velocities.\nStellar input parameters to the model are: rotation period, radius, and mass (the latter two in\nsolar units). The rotation period is used in the calculation of the longitude position of starspots in\nsuccessive transits. We also have two limb darkening parameters. The planetary input parameters\nare: orbital period, radius, mass, orbital inclination angle, eccentricity and position of the periastron. From the orbital period, the orbit's semi-major axis is calculated by Kepler's Third Law.\nLastly, the moon input parameters are orbital period, radius, mass, and the angular position of\nthe moon in its orbit at the starting time of the first transit. For the rings, the input parameters\nconsists of inner and outer radii, two inclination angles, one with respect to the plane of the sky\nand the other with the planet's orbital plane. The transparency of the rings may also be fit.\nThe temporal resolution of the resulting light curve is chosen within the model, by adjusting\nthe time interval for each simulated photometric data point. Here we used a temporal resolution\nof 32 s for future comparison with CoRoT data, and 1 min for Kepler data.\nUsing stellar and planetary parameters, the planetary orbit is calculated. The line of transit is\nthe projection of this orbit on the stellar surface. At each time interval, the program calculates the\nposition of the planet and its moon. The total luminosity of the star\u2013planet\u2013moon system is then\ndetermined by summing the intensities of all the pixels in the image, where the pixels occupied\nby the planet and its moon have zero value. In the case of rings, the occupied pixels intensity is\nmultiplied by the ring transparency factor. At the end of the transit, the light curve is normalized\nto one from the outside transit data points.\nFigure 1 shows two examples of transits from the model. Figure 1(a) shows the transit of a\nplanet and a moon in front of the star, and Figure 1(b) shows the transit of a planet with rings.\nIt is also possible to add spots on the stellar surface, where each spot is modeled by three extra\nparameters: radius, intensity (with respect to stellar central intensity), and longitude position at\nthe start of the first transit. The spot latitude is considered to be that of the projected transit line.\nFrom the stellar rotation period, the spot longitude position on consecutive transits is calculated.\nA further assumption is that the spot position does not change within a single transit (usually\nlasting a few hours), which is reasonable when the stellar rotation period is much larger than the\ntransit duration.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 1.- (a) A Jupiter-like planet and a 2 R\u2295 moon transiting in front of the star. (b) A Saturnlike planet with rings transiting in front of the star. The rings have the same dimensions as Saturn's.\nThe angle with the sky plane is 78\u25e6 , and the angle with orbital plane is 20\u25e6 . Both images were\nobtained from the model.\n2.1.\n\nPlanet-Moon dynamics\n\nIn this work, no attempt has been made for a dynamical analysis of a planet with moons or\nrings. We used for this matter, regarding to planet-moon systems, the results of Domingos et al.\n(2006), where the authors through numerical simulations obtain semi empirical expressions for the\nsemi-major axis maximum and minimum that a satellite in orbit of a giant extrasolar planet may\nhave as a function of the stellar and planetary parameters. Domingos et al. (2006) also estimates\nthe maximum mass of a satellite such that its orbit is stable. An interesting result is that planets\nwith very close in orbits to their host star can only hold moons with very small masses, but more\ndistant planets may have stable moons with masses even larger than that of the Earth.\nFor example, Rho Crb at a distance of 0.224 AU from its host star, with an orbital period\nof 39.8 d, may harbor a satellite of up to 1.5 M\u2295 . Further away planets, such as HD 92788, at\napproximately 1 AU from its star, allows for a satellite with a maximum mass of 1 \u00d7 104 M\u2295 .\nThe transiting extrasolar planets with the longest periods observed so far are CoRoT-9b (95.27 d),\nHD 80606 (114.34 d) and Kepler-11 g (118.37 d). Thus, these planets may harbor a moon with\nmass similar or even larger than Earth, that may be detectable from the application of the present\nmethod to CoRoT or Kepler lightcurves.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n2.2.\n\nPlanetary transit\n\nFigure 2 shows two examples of lightcurves obtained from our model. The figure on the left,\n2(a), is for the transit of a planet like HD 209458b (Southworth (2010)), whereas the figure on the\nright, 2(b), is for a planet similar to CoRoT-2b (Alonso et al. (2008)).\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 2.- Transit model of two planets. (a) HD 209458b (R = 1.38 RJ , P = 3.524 days, i = 86.59\u25e6 ),\nand (b) CoRoT-2b (R = 1.465 RJ , P = 1.743 days, i = 87.84\u25e6 ).\n\n2.3.\n\nTransit of a planet with a moon\n\nFigure 3 shows two examples of lightcurves of a planet with an orbiting moon. Both panels are\nfor a Jupiter size planet transiting a star identical to the Sun with an orbital period of 45 days. In\nthe model, the added moon around this planet has 2 Earth radii. In 3(a), the moon orbital period\nis 5 days, while in Figure 3(b) it is 2 days. Also, the position angle of the moon with respect to\nthe planet is 0\u25e6 in the first case, and 60\u25e6 in the second one.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 3.- Model light curve of a transiting hot Jupiter (R = 1 RJ , P = 45 days, i = 89.5\u25e6 )\naround a Sun-like star, and an orbiting moon with 2 R\u2295 . The moon period and position angle are,\nrespectively: (a) PM = 5 days and \u03c6 = 0\u25e6 ; (b) PM = 2 days and \u03c6 = 60\u25e6 .\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nWhen adding a moon around a planet in the model, two characteristics signatures may occur.\nThe first one is a step, that may appear at the beginning or the at the end of a transit, while the\nsecond effect is a discontinuity, a jump, seen in the bottom of the transit. The step at the beginning\n(see Figure 3(a)) occurs when the moon ingress happens before that of the planet, while the step\nnear the end of the transit (Figure 3(b)) is caused by the moon egress after the planet. Both effects\nare marked with an upward arrow.\nFurthermore, when the moon orbital period is small, an asymmetry arises in the bottom of the\ntransit, shown by the downward arrows in Figure 3. This asymmetry is generated when the moon is\neclipsed by the planet. It may also happen if at the start of the transit the moon is already behind\n(or in front) of the planet, but falls out of eclipse during the transit. The width and intensity of\nthis signal depends on the moon's relative orbital period, radius, and also on the position angle \u03c6\nof the moon with respect to the planet at the initial transit time.\n\n2.4.\n\nTransit of a planet with rings\n\nFigure 4 presents the modeled light curve produced by a transiting Saturn-like planet around\na star with solar parameters (left panel). To enhance the signal produced by the ring presence,\ntheir size were augmented by 50% (right panel).\nThe main effect of the planetary ring system is to increase the covered area of the stellar\nsurface. The result of which is to deepen the transit light curve. Moreover, the transit shape\nbecomes rounder at the ingress and egress instants, than if no rings are present. Both these factors\ndepend strongly on the ring transparency, being larger in the case of more opaque rings, as expected.\nAn interesting effect appears when the ring size is increased. In this case, the light curve\nbecomes more triangular, similar to the light curves produced during grazing eclipses of binary star\nsystems.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 4.- Transiting Saturn-like planet (R = 0.84 RJ , P = 5 days, i = 88\u25e6 ) in front of a solar-like\nstar. Planetary rings with sizes (a) equal and (b) increased by 50% with respect to those of Saturn.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n2.5.\n\nStarspots\n\nIf the star has one or more spots on its surface, similar to sunspots, Silva (2003) has shown\nthat the photometric light curve during a planetary transit will display a small \"bump\". This\noccurs because when the planet occults a darker region of the stellar surface, occupied by the spot,\nthere is a relative increase in the total intensity. Moreover, the detection of the same starspots on\ndifferent transits may be used to determine the rotation period of the star (Silva-Valio (2008)).\nFigure 5 shows the same light curves from Figure 2, except now a spot was added to the stellar\nsurface. This spot, located at 30o longitude (measured from the center of the star), has a size of\nhalf each planet radius and a relative intensity of 0.6 times the stellar central intensity.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 5.- Planetary transit light curves for (a) HD 209458b and (b) CoRoT-2b, where the \"bump\"\nin the bottom of the transit indicates the presence of a spot on the stellar surface. In each case,\nthe spot has half the planet radius and intensity 0.6, and is located at 30\u25e6 with respect to the star\ncenter.\nIn some cases, the photometric signal produced by the presence of moons may be mistaken by\nthat caused by starspots. Distinguishing between the two cases is possible when successive transit\nare observed, since the spots signal will have a periodicity equal to the stellar rotation period, while\nthose of the moons will have a different period, following its own orbital period.\nExamples of how confusing things can get, especially how the presence of starspots may hinder\nthe detection of moons, are shown in Figure 6. The figure presents the transit of a planet with an\norbiting moon in front of a star, in which surface there is a spot, for two situations: only one spot\n(6(a)) and star with 4 spots (6(b)). In both panels, the planet is identical to Jupiter with a period\nof 45 d and the moon has 3 Earth radius and an orbital period of 2 d around the planet. In the\ncase of Figure 6(b), it is clearly seen that the presence of starspots can significantly difficult the\ndetection of any moon effect on the light curve.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 6.- Jupiter-like transiting planet (R = 1 RJ , P = 45 days, i = 89.5\u25e6 ) with a 3 R\u2295 moon around\na star equal to the Sun. (a) The star has a spot with 0.5 planet radius, intensity 0.6, located at\n30\u25e6 . (b) The star has 4 spots, with radius respectively 0.7, 0.6, 0.7 and 0.8 planet radius, intensity\n0.6, 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7, located at -30, -15, 5 and 30\u25e6 . Each spot signal appears duplicated, once when\nthe moon occults it and the other when the planet eclipses the spot.\n3.\n\nTest results from the model\n\nTo verify the detectability of moon and ring systems around a planet, it is possible to add\nGaussian noise to the modeled light curve and then try and recover the input parameters from\na fit. For CoRoT data simulation, we used a noise level of 6 \u00d7 10\u22124 , such as that observed for\nCoRoT-2 (Silva-Valio & Lanza 2010), and in the case of the Kepler data, 2 \u00d7 10\u22125 .\nOnce the noise has been added to the model light curve, we fit this light curve with the following\nsequence of algorithms. First the PIKAIA (Charbonneau 1995) algorithm is used to obtain a\nfirst guess that is then inputed into the AMOEBA (Nelder & Mead 1965) routine. PIKAIA is a\ngenetic algorithm the main advantage of which is to find the global maximum of the function to\nbe maximized, using only the allowed interval value for each free parameter. These results are\nthen used as input to the AMOEBA routine that refines the result using the simplex method for\nconvergence minimization. The error estimates for the fitted parameters were obtained using the\nMPFIT algorithm (Markwardt 2009).\nAfter the fitting procedure, we compute the goodness-of-fit using the parameter Q, as defined\nin Press et al. (1992) as the probability that the chi-square should exceed a particular value \u03c72 by\nchance and calculated by:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03bd \u03c72\n2\n,\n,\n(1)\nQ(\u03c7 |\u03bd) = 1 \u2212 P\n2 2\nwhere P is the incomplete gamma function P (a, x). Generally, if Q is larger than 0.01, then the\nfit is acceptable. In this case, it can be said that such event (moon or ring) is detectable. If Q is\nbetween 0.001 and 0.01, then the fit may or not be acceptable, and more studies about the noise\nare required. This can be caused, for example, if the measurement errors are underestimated. Q\nbelow 0.001 indicates a bad fit. On the other hand, Q very close to 1 is not expected also. This is,\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nliterally, too good to be true. This can be caused for nonnormal error distribution, or overestimated\nmeasurement errors. Next, we show some examples of the fit to light curves with noise added, and\nthe results they yield.\n\n3.1.\n\nFit of a planetary transit\n\nThe first test to the model is to apply it to the two transiting planets described in Section 2.2,\nwhere Gaussian noise has been added similar to that of CoRoT and Kepler observations. In this\nfit, all the stellar parameters and the orbital period (or semi-major axis) of the planet were fixed,\nand the only free parameters were the planetary radius and the orbital inclination angle.\nThe comparison between the original parameters and those obtained from the fit of the noisy\nmodeled light curve are seen in Tables 1 and 2, and and in Figures 7(a) and 7(b) for HD 209458\nand CoRoT-2. Both light curves had noise level similar to the CoRoT satellite. The two panels\nshow the simulated data points as dots and the fit as a solid line. The residuals are shown in the\nlower part of each panel.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 7.- Light curve fit of model planetary transit for (a) HD 209458b and (b) CoRoT-2b.

The first one is the noise, as expected. In cases where the moon is very small, their\nsignature in the light curve is flooded by the noise level, leaving it undetectable. Another difficulty\nis the presence of starspots on the stellar surface, mentioned above.\nTo demonstrate how moons can be detected, we consider the case of a hot Jupiter with a\nperiod of 45 days around its host star, modelled with no spots. In orbit around this planet there\nis a moon with 3 Earth radii and a period of 5 days. Simulations were performed for both noise\nlevels of CoRoT and Kepler. The parameters obtained from the fit and the original ones are listed\nin Table 3, whereas the fit results are plotted in Figure 8, for CoRoT noise level. The fit was\nperformed for 5 consecutive transits, but the figure shows only the first.\n\nFig. 8.- Light curve fit for the first transit of a hot Jupiter (R = 1 RJ , P = 45 days, i = 89.5\u25e6 )\nwith a moon (RM = 3 R\u2295 , PM = 5 days) considering the noise level of CoRoT.\nWe noticed that the larger the number of transits considered in the fit, the smaller the number\nof iterations necessary for the fitting algorithms to obtain a good fit, that is, the easier it is to\ndetect the moon.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n\nTable 3: Fit result of 5 transits of a planet with an orbiting moon.\nNoise Level\n\nCoRoT\n\nKepler\n\nParameter\nPlanet radius (RJ )\nMoon period (days)\nMoon radius (R\u2295 )\nMoon position angle (\u25e6 )\nPlanet radius (RJ )\nMoon period (days)\nMoon radius (R\u2295 )\nMoon position angle (\u25e6 )\n\n3.3.\n\nOriginal Value\n1.0\n5.0\n3.0\n0.0\n1.0\n5.0\n3.0\n0.0\n\nFit Result\n0.9976 \u00b1 0.0005\n5.001 \u00b1 0.012\n2.979 \u00b1 0.019\n0.21 \u00b1 0.11\n0.9999 \u00b1 0.0007\n5.000 \u00b1 0.023\n2.999 \u00b1 0.024\n-0.4 \u00b1 0.6\n\nReduced \u03c72\n\nQ\n\n1.0070\n\n0.3954\n\n1.0419\n\n0.1337\n\nTransit fit of a planet with rings\n\nAs seen above, planetary rings can be detected by the round shape of the transit at ingress\nand egress times, besides the larger depth of the transit (due to the increase in the stellar surface\narea covered). For these signatures to be detectable, the noise is the predominant factor. If the\nsignature is too small, the noise will completely overcome it.\nTo exemplify, we simulate the transit of a planet identical to Saturn and its rings, with 30-days\nperiod and 89\u25e6 orbital inclination. The transit is modeled for two cases: that with the noise level of\nCoRoT and the other with that of Kepler telescope. In both cases, the light curve was submitted\nto a fit process assuming only the presence of the planet. The result of this preliminary fit is shown\nin Figure 9 and Table 4.\nTable 4: Fit results for a Saturn-like planet simulation, considering only the planet.\nNoise level\nCoRoT\nKepler\n\nParameter\nPlanet radius (RJ )\nOrbital inclination (\u25e6 )\nPlanet radius (RJ )\nOrbital inclination (\u25e6 )\n\nOriginal Value\n0.84\n89\n0.84\n89\n\nFit result\n0.934 \u00b1 0.022\n89.0 \u00b1 0.4\n0.9434 \u00b1 0.0009\n88.999 \u00b1 0.019\n\nReduced \u03c72\n\nQ\n\n1.0291\n\n0.2050\n\n25.10\n\n0\n\nFrom the analysis of the residual plotted on Figure 9 and the Q value in Table 4, we see\nthat the fit considering only the planet yields a satisfactory result only for the CoRoT noise level\n(Figure 9(b)). This indicates that a ring system such as that of Saturn could only be detected by\nthe Kepler satellite. The CoRoT satellite would identify this light curve as that produced by a\ngiant planet with a radius slightly larger than that of Saturn (12.3 %), but without rings.\nNext, we fit only the light curve plotted in Figure 9(b) but now considering the presence of\nrings, that is the ring parameters are taken into account. The resulting fit parameters are listed in\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 9.- Saturn-like planet (R = 0.84 RJ , P = 5 days, i = 88\u25e6 ) transit fitted without considering\nthe presence of its rings for noise levels of the (a) CoRoT and(b) Kepler telescopes, respectively.\nTable 5, whereas the result of the fit is plotted in Figure 10. Comparing the residual of Figures 9(b)\nand 10, one can see that the fit is much better for the model where the rings were included.\n\nFig. 10.- Saturn-like planet (R = 0.84 RJ , P = 5 days, i = 88\u25e6 ) transit fitted, considering now\nthe presence of rings.\nThe Q value in Table 5 and the residuals in Figure 10 show that the fit was satisfactory.\n\n4.\n\nDetection limits\n\nTo determine the radius of the smallest detectable moon, several simulations were performed\ndecreasing the radius at each run. Every simulation had its light curve fitted yielding the moon\nparameters. Whenever the Q value indicates a good fit, we consider the moon detectable. Thus, in\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n\nTable 5: Resulting parameters for the case of a transiting Saturn, as would be observed by Kepler.\nParameter\nPlanet radius (RJ )\nOrbital inclination (\u25e6 )\nInner radius (RP )\nOuter radius (RP )\nAngle with the sky plane (\u25e6 )\nAngle with the orbital plane (\u25e6 )\nTransparency\n\nOriginal Value\n0.84\n89\n1.11\n2.32\n78.0\n20.0\n0.5\n\nFit Result\n0.839 \u00b1 0.005\n89.00 \u00b1 0.03\n1.11 \u00b1 0.06\n2.316 \u00b1 0.026\n77.9 \u00b1 1.5\n19.9 \u00b1 0.5\n0.51 \u00b1 0.06\n\nReduced \u03c72\n\nQ\n\n1.0173\n\n0.3553\n\nthe case of CoRoT, the smallest detectable moon in orbit around a Jupiter size planet has a radius\nof 1.3 R\u2295 , while in the case of Kepler, this minimum radius decreases to 0.3 R\u2295 . The latter moon\nwould be smaller than Ganimedes, the larger moon of our Solar System, which size is 0.41 R\u2295 . In\nall the simulations, the star was considered Sun-like with no spots.\nFor the case of planetary rings, the process is slightly different, because, in this case, the\nbiggest problem is distinguishing between single planets and those with rings. In this case, then,\nwe adopt a criterion that takes into consideration the residuals. When fitting the light curve of a\nplanet with rings, first only the planet parameters are fit. If the Q value indicates a bad fit, then\nwe may conclude that the rings can be detectable.\nTo establish a detectability criterion, first we define the effective area of the rings as the ring\nprojection on the plane of the sky multiplied by its opacity, according to:\n\u0001\n2\nAef f = RE\n\u2212 RI2 \u03c0 cos \u03c8 (1 \u2212 \u03c4 )\n\n(2)\n\nwhere RI and RE are the internal and external radii, respectively, \u03c8 is the inclination angle of the\nrings relative to the plane of the sky, and \u03c4 is the transparency. Totally transparent rings have\n\u03c4 = 1, whereas totally opaque ones have a zero value of transparency.\nThe results of our simulations showed that in the case of the Kepler data, planetary rings are\ndetectable when the effective area corresponds to approximately 3% of the area covered by the\nplanet. For example, rings with \u03c4 = 0.5 and inclination angle of 78\u25e6 with the plane of the sky in\norbit a Saturn-like planet, will be detectable with rings about 51% the size of those of Saturn. For\nthe CoRoT data, the effective area corresponds to approximately the area of the planet. Therefore,\nfor the same planet as in the previous case, the rings should have sizes 45% larger than those of\nSaturn to be detectable above the CoRoT noise level.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\n5.\n\nConclusion\n\nHere we reported the results of a model capable of simulating planetary transits, including the\neffect of existing moons and rings around that planet. Light curves were presented for each case.\nEstimates of the threshold detection for such events were made. It was shown how these events\nmay be detected using the PIKAIA and AMOEBA routines for curve fitting. As expected, the\nmain limiting factor for the possible detection is the noise level of the telescopes. This can be seen\nby comparing the results from simulations of photometric light curves of CoRoT and Kepler.\nThe CoRoT data allows for the detection of moons with at least 1.3 R\u2295 in size around a planet\nidentical to Jupiter. In the case of Kepler data, this detection limit on the moon radius drops to\n0.3 R\u2295 . For planetary rings, a Saturn-like planet would be detectable with Kepler, however, this\nsame planet-ring system would be mistakenly inferred as a single planet with slightly larger radius\nby CoRoT. Detection limits for both telescopes were estimated above.\nNext, this model will be applied to real light curves to search for the types of signatures\ndescribed in this work. Data from both CoRoT and Kepler will be used. An improvement that\ncan be made to the model is the implementation of analysis of the transit time and duration\nvariations caused by the presence of the moon that makes the planet orbit the common center\u2013of\u2013\nmass (Kipping 2009a,b). These timing variations would confirm the presence of moons. Finally, by\ndetecting the moon by both methods, photometry and timing variation, it is possible to establish\na complete set of physical parameters for the satellite.\n\n6.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors acknowledge financial support from the Brazilian agencies CAPES and FAPESP\n(grant number 2006/50654-3).\n\nREFERENCES\nR.
