Furthermore, while the full-scale implementation of quantum\ncomputation is likely to remain a distant hope for years\nto come, secure quantum key distribution protocols may\nbegin to play an important role in the world of information security in the not-too-distant future.\nIn the simplest case of independent and identically distributed noise, which we will consider here and to which\nmost quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols can be\nreduced [2, 3], the capacity of a channel for private classical communication was studied in [4]. In that work, a\nmulti-letter formula for the private classical capacity was\nprovided (and, indeed, a similar formula for a channel's\ncapacity for quantum communication). Unfortunately,\nthis multi-letter formula cannot be evaluated in general,\nand thus provides only a partial characterization of the\ncapacity we seek.\nIn lieu of a closed form expression for the private classical capacity of a quantum channel, which we will call\nCp , it is the primary purpose of this work to provide upper bounds. In particular, we will consider the capacity\nof a quantum channel for private classical communication when assisted by the family of (one-way) quantum\nchannels that map symmetrically to their output and environment. Since any such channel has zero private capacity on its own, one would expect the resulting bound\nto be quite tight. This approach is very much in the\nspirit of [5], and in fact our expression for the symmetric\nside-channel assisted private capacity (ss-private capacity) shares many of the nice properties of the ss-capacity\nfound there, namely it is single-letter, additive, and con-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: gsbsmith@gmail.com\n\nvex.\nA secondary goal of this work is to explore the connection\nbetween unconditional privacy and quantum coherence,\nwhich has long been folklore in the quantum information\ncommunity and provided motivation for the coding theorems proved in [4] (see also [6, 7]). While this analogy is\nquite useful, it is known that the correspondence is not\nexact. Indeed, there are quantum channels for which the\ncapacity for private communicaton and quantum communication are quite different. In [8] it was shown that\nthere exist quantum states from which no entanglement\ncan be distilled via two-way classical communication but\nwhich nevertheless can be used to create secure key via\none-way public classical communication. This leads to\nexamples of channels with zero quantum capacity but\nnonzero private classical capacity.\nUnderstanding the connection between coherence and\nprivacy in a quantitative way does not seem to be possible\nat the moment, as there do not yet exist simple expressions for either the private classical or quantum capacities\nof a channel. However, we will show below that, for the\nclass of channels known as degradable, it is possible to\nfind a simple expression for the private classical capacity, Cp , and indeed for such channels Cp is exactly the\nquantum capacity (which, due to [9] has a closed-form\nexpression). As well as giving the first examples of nontrivial channels for which Cp can be found explicitly, this\nprovides a setting in which the above mentioned analogy\nbetween privacy and coherence can be made exact.\nFurthermore, the ss-private-capacity of a degradable\nchannel is exactly equal to its (unassisted) quantum capacity. We will combine this result with the convexity\nof the ss-private capacity to provide a new technique for\nupper-bounding the private capacity of a general quantum channel, extending the current best known bounds\nfor the quantum capacity of the depolarizing to its private\ncapacity and providing new bounds for private capacity\nof a channel with independent phase and amplitude noise.\nThis last result leads to collective attacks on BB84 that\noutperform the optimal individual attack.\n\n\f2\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section\nII we study the private capacity of a degradable channel,\nin Section III we provide a single-letter formula for the\nss-private capacity of a general channel, while in Section\nIV we provide upper bounds for the private capacity of\nsome specific quantum channels and discuss their relation\nto collective attacks in QKD. In Section V we mention a\nfew open problems.\n\nII.\n\nNOISY PROCESSING IS NO HELP FOR\nDEGRADABLE N\n\nIn a classical setting, if we imagine a broadcast channel\nwhich maps N : X \u2192 (Y, Z), where Y is the output to\nthe receiver and Z is the output of an eavesdropper, it\nwas shown in [10] that the secret-key capacity of N is\nexactly\nCp (N ) = sup (I(T ; Y ) \u2212 I(T ; Z)) .\n\n(1)\n\nX\u2192T\n\nHere the optimization is over a reference variable\nX, which represents the distribution of messages sent\nthrough the channel, together with a noisy processing of\nX that generates T .\nBy analogy with this result, one may imagine that the\nprivate classical capacity of a quantum channel would be\ngiven by\nCp(1) (N ) :=\n\nsup\n{px ,|\u03c6x i},X\u2192T\n\n(I(T ; B)\u03c9 \u2212 I(T ; E)\u03c9 ) ,\n\nP\n\u2020\nwhere \u03c9ABE =\nx,t p(t|x)p(x)|tiht|A \u2297 UN |\u03c6x ih\u03c6x |UN\nwith UN an isometric extension of N (i.e., N (\u03c1) =\n\u2020\n). So, the optimization would again be taken\nTrE UN \u03c1UN\nover input random variable X (this time with a choice of\nbasis), together with a classical noisy processing X \u2192 T .\nIndeed, the coding theorem proved in [4] showed that this\nrate is in fact achievable:\n\nCp (N ) \u2265 Cp(1) (N ),\nbut did not establish the converse statement. Instead, it\nwas shown that\nCp (N ) = lim\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n1 (1) \u2297n\nC (N ).\nn p\n\nEvidence was found in [11] that this regularization, as the\nlimit over n is typically called in this context, is necessary\nin general.\nA class of channels for which we will be able to explicitly\nevaluate Cp are called degradable, and were defined in\n[9] in analogy with the classical notion of a degraded\nbroadcast channel [12].\n\nDefinition 1 A channel N is called degradable if there\nexists a completely positive trace preserving degrading\nmap D such that\nb,\nD\u25e6N =N\n\n\u2020\nb (\u03c1) = TrB UN \u03c1U \u2020 .\nwhere N (\u03c1) = TrE UN \u03c1UN\nand N\nN\n\nBelow, we will prove that the private classical capacity\nof a degradable channel is equal to its quantum capacity.\nThe quantum capacity is, in turn, equal to the singleletter optimized coherent information. This result is very\nmuch in line with the findings of [10], in which it was\nshown that in the classical case if Z is a degraded version\nof Y , the noisy processing in Eq. (1) is unecessary.\nTheorem 2 If N is degradable, then\nCp (N ) = Q(1) (N ) = sup I(AiB)I\u2297N |\u03c6ih\u03c6| ,\n\u03c6\n\nwhere I(AiB)\u03c1 = S(B) \u2212 S(AB).\nTo prove this, we will need the following lemma.\nLemma 3 If N is degradable, then\nCp(1) (N ) = Q(1) (N ) = sup I(AiB)I\u2297N |\u03c6ih\u03c6| .\n\u03c6\n\nP\nProof Let N be degradable, fix \u03c6 = x px |\u03c6x ih\u03c6x | and\nlet\nX\n\u2020\n\u03c9XT BE =\npx,t |xihx|X \u2297 |tiht|T \u2297 UN |\u03c6x ih\u03c6x |UN\n.\nx,t\n\nThen I(X; B) = I(T ; B) + I(X; B|T ), which is a consequence of the chain rule, together with the fact that\nI(XT ; B) = I(X; B) because X \u2192 T . This implies that\nCp(1) (N ) =\n\nsup\n{px ,|\u03c6x i},X\u2192T\n\n=\n\nsup\n{px ,|\u03c6x i},X\u2192T\n\n(I(T ; B)\u03c9 \u2212 I(T ; E)\u03c9 )\n\n\u0010\n\nI(X; B) \u2212 I(X; E)\n\n\u0011\n\u2212 (I(X; B|T ) \u2212 I(X; E|T )) .\n\nSince N is degradable, and conditional mutual information is monotonic under local operations (LO) when the\nsystem conditioned on is classical (an immediate consequence of the LO monotonicity of mutual information,\nitself a consequence of strong subadditivity), we have\nI(X; B|T ) \u2265 I(X; E|T ), so that\nCp(1) (N ) =\n=\n\nsup\n{px ,|\u03c6x i}\n\nsup\n{px ,|\u03c6x i}\n\n(I(X; B) \u2212 I(X; E))\n(S(B) \u2212 S(B|X) \u2212 S(E) + S(E|X))\n\n= sup (S(B) \u2212 S(E))\n\u03c6\n\n= sup I(AiB) = Q(1) (N ).\n\u03c6\n\n\f3\n\u2293\n\u2294\n\nThe following lemma, which shows that Q(1) is additive\nfor degradable channels, was proved in [9]. We provide\nan alternate proof for both clarity and completeness.\nLemma 4 For N1 and N2 degradable,\nQ\nProof\nnamely\n\n(1)\n\n(N1 \u2297 N2 ) = Q\n\n(1)\n\n(N1 ) + Q\n\n(1)\n\n(N2 ).\n\nLet |\u03c6iAA\u20321 A\u20322 be optimal for Q(1) (N1 \u2297 N2 ),\n\nWe would like to show that\n(2)\n\nsince this would immediately imply Q(1) (N1 ) +\nQ(1) (N2 ) \u2265 Q(1) (N1 \u2297 N2 ), and therefore the theorem.\n\nIn fact, Eq. (2) is equivalent to\n\nI(B1 ; B2 ) \u2265 I(E1 ; E2 ),\nwhich, is satisfied due to the degradability of N1 and N2\ntogether with the monotonicity of mutual information\nunder local operations.\n\u2293\n\u2294\nWe are now in a position to prove Theorem 2.\n\nProof [of Theorem 2] Let N be degradable. Then,\nfrom [4], the secret-key capacity of N is\nCp (N ) = lim\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nLetting S = Sd \u2282 \u22a4 \u2297 \u22a5 be the d(d + 1)/2dimensional symmetric subspace between \u22a4 and \u22a5 and\nVd : Cd(d+1)/2 \u2192 S, we call\nAd (\u03c1) = Tr\u22a5 Vd \u03c1Vd\u2020\n\nthe d-dimensional symmetric channel. Note that Ad\nmaps states on Cd(d+1)/2 to states on Cd .\n\nQ(1) (N1 \u2297 N2 ) = I(AiB1 B2 )I\u2297N1 \u2297N2 |\u03c6ih\u03c6| .\nI(AA\u20321 iB2 ) + I(AA\u20322 iB1 ) \u2265 I(AiB1 B2 ),\n\nWe say that a rate R is achievable over N \u2297n if for every\n\u01eb > 0 and all sufficiently large n there is a a code Cn \u2282\nA\u2297n that is \u01eb-good for N \u2297n with limn\u2192\u221e log n|Cn | \u2265 R.\nThe private classical capacity of N is then defined as the\nmaximum achievable rate.\n\n1 (1) \u2297n\nC (N ).\nn p\n\nThe symmetric side-channel assisted private classical capacity of a channel N is simply the private capacity of N\nwhen assisted by an arbitrary symmetric channel.

The ss-private classical capacity is then the maximum ss-achievable key rate.\nThe main result of this work is the following theorem\ncharacterizing the ss-private capacity.\nTheorem 5 The ss-private capacity of N is\n(1)\nCp,ss\n(N ) =\n\nNote that this expression for Cp,ss is related to but differs\nfrom the upper bound presented in [13], which in this case\ntranslates to\nsup\n\n1\nCp (N ) = lim Q(1) (N \u2297n ),\nn\u2192\u221e n\n\nIII.\n\n{px ,|\u03c6x iA }X\u2192\u03c3U ,X\u2192\u03c3V\n\n\u2293\n\u2294\n\nPRIVATE CLASSICAL CAPACITY WITH A\nSYMMETRIC SIDE-CHANNEL\n\n(I(T ; BF ) \u2212 I(T ; EG)) ,\n\n(3)\nwith the optimization over |\u03c6x iAF G symmetric in F G.\n\nBy Lemma 3 and the degradability of N \u2297n , we have\n\nwhile Lemma 4 gives us Cp (N ) = Q(1) (N ).\n\nsup\n{px ,|\u03c6x iAF G }X\u2192T\n\n(I(U ; BV ) \u2212 I(U ; EV ))\n\nin that the optimization in Theorem 5 is restricted to\nclassical T rather than a general \u03c3U .

As a result,\nCp(1) (N \u2297 Ad ) = Q(1) (N \u2297 Ad )\n\n= Q(1) (N ) + Q(1) (Ad ) = Q(1) (N ),\n\nso that, by the characterization of Cp,ss in Eq.(4), we\nhave Cp,ss (N ) = Q(1) (N ).\n\u2293\n\u2294\n\nWe will now use the convexity of Cp,ss to show that the\nfollowing quantity, which we call the cost of degradable\nmixing, is an upper bound for Cp .\n\nDefinition 10 We define the cost of degradable mixing\nas\nX\npi Q(1) (Ni ),\nCDM (N ) =\ninf\n{pi ,Ni ,Di }\n\ni\n\nwhere the infimum is over {pi , Ni , Di } such that\nX\npi Di \u25e6 Ni\nN =\ni\n\nand each Ni is either degradable or anti-degradable.\nThat is, we will prove the following theorem.\n\nwhere in the last line we have used the fact that for Ni either degradable or antidegradable, Cp,ss (Ni ) = Q(1) (Ni ).\n\u2293\n\u2294\n\nOne might wonder about the inclusion of Di s in the definition of the cost of degradable mixing-wouldn't the\nbound be tighter if they were all chosen to be the identity? The trouble is that not all channels can be written as a convex combination of degradable and antidegradable channels, but any channel can be decomposed\ninto the form required by our definition (e.g., choose only\none term, and let N1 = I and D1 = N , the channel of interest ). In particular, while all extremal qubit channels\nare either degradable or antidegradable (or both)[20], and\ntherefore any qubit channel can be written as a convex\ncombination of such channels, the same is not true in\nhigher dimension. For example[27], the tensor product\nof two extremal qubit channels, one degradable and the\nother anti-degradable (but neither both), is generically\nan extremal channel on two qubits, but is neither degradable nor anti-degradable, and in light of its extremality\ncannot be decomposed into such channels. To get around\nthis, we include the Di s in the definition of the cost of\ndegradable mixing. In the two qubit example, we find\nCDM is exactly equal to the quantum capacity of the\ndegradable channel, and therefore so is the private capacity, incidentally providing an example of a nondegradable\nchannel for which the private and quantum capacities coincide.\n\nIV.\n\nSOME SPECIFIC CHANNELS\n\nTheorem 11 gives us a technique for bounding the private\ncapacity of a general channel, N , in terms of the private\n\n\f6\ncapacity of a set of degradable channels appearing in a\nconvex decomposition of N . We now use this method to\nprovide upper bounds for the key capacity of two channels of interest for quantum key distribution - the Pauli\nchannel with independent phase and amplitude noise and\nthe depolarizing channel. The resulting bounds meet or\nexceed all previously known bounds on the private classical capacity of these channels [15, 16, 17, 18].\n\nwhich can also be written as\n1\n1\n(U \u2020 \u03c1U )U \u2020 + U XN\u03b3ampdamp\n(XU \u2020 \u03c1U X)XU \u2020 ,\nU N\u03b3ampdamp\nq\nq\n2\n2\n\u03c0\n\nwhere U = ei 4 X and \u03b3q = 4q(1 \u2212 q).\n\nFrom the previous subsection, the private capacity of an\namplitude damping channel with noise parameter \u03b3 is\nf (\u03b3) = max (H(t(1 \u2212 \u03b3)) \u2212 H(t\u03b3)) ,\nt\u2208[0,1]\n\nA.\n\nDegradable Channels\n\nIn this subsection we explicitly evaluate the private capacity of some degradable channels.\nA qubit channels with two Kraus operators has, up to\nlocal unitaries, Kraus operators equal to [19]\n\u0012\u221a\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u221a \u0013\n1\u2212\u03b3 \u221a 0\n0\n\u03b4\nA0 =\nA1 = \u221a\n.\n1\u2212\u03b4\n0\n\u03b3 0\nIt was shown in [20] that any such channel is either\ndegradable or anti-degradable. The private capacity of\nsuch a channel is thus the optimized single-letter coherent information:\nCp (N(\u03b3,\u03b4) ) = max [H(t(1\u2212\u03b3)+(1\u2212t)\u03b4)\u2212H(t\u03b3+(1\u2212t)\u03b4)] .\nt\u2208[0,1]\n\nThis result includes the dephasing and amplitude damping channels as a special case: setting \u03b3 = 0 gives an\namplitude damping channel, whereas setting \u03b3 = \u03b4 gives\nthe bitflip channel (which is unitarily equivalent to a dephasing channel)[28].\nThe erasure channel with erasure probability p, which\nmaps Cd into Cd \u2295 |ei, acts as\n\nso that\n\nCp (N(q(1\u2212q),q2 ,q(1\u2212q)) ) \u2264 f (\u03b3q ).\n\u0011\n\u0010\nThis gives a threshold of 21 1 \u2212 \u221a12 beyond which no\nkey can be generated, which is the same as found for\nBB84 in[16] , and also confirmed in [13] and [15]. We can\nalso write the N(q(1\u2212q),q2 ,q(1\u2212q)) as a convex combination\nof dephasing channels with dephasing probability q(2\u2212q),\nwhich results in slightly tighter bounds for very small\nnoise (i.e., q < 0.02). Our combined upper bound on key\nrate is given by\nCp (N(q(1\u2212q),q2 ,q(1\u2212q)) ) \u2264 conv (1 \u2212 H(q(2 \u2212 q)), f (\u03b3q )) ,\n(5)\nand tightens the previous best bounds of [16] (which\nconsidered only protocols without noisy processing), and\nthe\n\u0011 line) bound found in [15] for all 0 < q <\n\u0010 (straight\n1\n1\n\u221a\n2 1 \u2212 2 (see Figure 1). The fact that we surpass the\n\nbound of [16] is particularly interesting, since it is also\nan achievable key rate against an adversary restricted to\nindividual attacks. Our bound thus shows that a completely general attack is strictly stronger than an individual attack.\n\nerasure\n(\u03c1) = (1 \u2212 p)\u03c1 + p|eihe|.\nN(p,d)\n\nThis channel is also degradable, and as a result its private classical capacity is exactly equal to its quantum\ncapacity:\nerasure\nCp (N(p,d)\n) = (1 \u2212 2p) log d.\n\nB.\n\nIndependent Phase and Amplitude errors\n\nThe Pauli channel with independent amplitude and phase\nnoise is an interesting case because of its relation to\nBB84, and also because it's easy to write as a convex\ncombination of degradables-it's just an equal mixture\nof two amplitude damping-type channels.\nWritten explicitly, the channel we are considering is\nN(q(1\u2212q),q2 ,q(1\u2212q)) (\u03c1) = (1\u2212q(2\u2212q))\u03c1 + q(1\u2212q)X\u03c1X\n+q 2 Y \u03c1Y + q(1\u2212q)Z\u03c1Z,\n\nC.\n\nDepolarizing channel\n\nA depolarizing channel with error probability p is a convex combination of six amplitude damping channels with\nerror parameter\n\u0011\n\u0010\np\np\n\u03b7p = 4 1 \u2212 p 1 \u2212 1 \u2212 p\n\n(see [5] for details). It is also a convex combination of\nthree dephasing channels with error probability p. Finally, the secret key capacity is zero whenever a channel\nis antidegradable, which happens at p = 1/4 [21], so that\nthe convexity of Cp,ss then implies\nCp,ss (Np ) \u2264 conv (1 \u2212 H(p), f (\u03b7p ), (1 \u2212 4p)+ ) ,\nwhere we have let x+ = x if x > 0 and 0 otherwise. This\nexpression is equal to the upper bound on the depolarizing channel's quantum capacity found in [5], so that\n\n\f7\nthe best known upper bounds for this channel actually\ncoincide.\nIt is worth mentioning that the bound on the threshold for the six-state protocol reported in [13] is strictly\nstronger than the p = 1/4 threshold implied by our\nbound. However, the [13] bound does not apply to the\nprivate capacity of the depolarizing channel, since it is\nvalid only for a restricted set of input states.\nFor comparison with the QKD literature, note that the\nrelationship between quantum bit error rate, q, and depolarizing error probability, p, is q = 2p/3.\n\nwhere we have let NpX (\u03c1) = (1 \u2212 p)\u03c1 + pX\u03c1X, and similarly for NpY and NpZ . This is a convex combination of\ndephasing-like channels with error probability |p|, which\nare degradable and have a private capacity of 1 \u2212 H(|p|),\nso that by Theorem 11 we have the result.\n\u2293\n\u2294\nIt is not entirely clear how to best decompose a Pauli\nchannel into a convex combination of amplitude damping channels, but it seems likely that such a decomposition (or perhaps a decomposition into channels with two\nKraus operators) would outperform the current bound\nfor high noise levels.\n\nE.\n\n1.2\n\nRelationship to collective attacks in QKD\n\n1\n\nIn this subsection we describe how the above upper\nbounds on the private capacity correspond to collective\nattacks on quantum key distribution protocols.

The\nlower curve is the best known achievable key rate from [11, 13].\nThe upper curve is the \"optimal eavesdropping\"' bound on\nBB84 (without noisy processing) found in [16], representing\nthe best possible individual attack. The middle curve is our\nupper bound from Eq. (5).\n\nwhere we will call the isometric extension of Ni UNi :\nA \u2192 BE. The attack associated with this decomposition is as follows: For each signal state sent, Eve applies\nUNi with probability pi , sends the B system to Bob, and\nstores her various E systems until the end of the protocol. After the protocol is complete, Eve collects all of\nher E systems associated with Ni and (jointly) measures\n\u2297pi n\nwhich of the typical eigenvectors of \u03c1E\nthe state is in.\ni\nBecause Ni is degradable, we can calculate exactly how\nmuch secret key Alice and Bob can distill from the resulting state-they can get a key rate of exactly Q(1) (Ni ).\nBecause a fraction pi of the signal states are\nP subjected to\nNi , the overall key rate is no more than i pi Q(1) (Ni ).\nV.\n\nD.\n\nPauli Channel\n\nFor a general Pauli channel we find the following bound.\nTheorem 12 Let\nNp (\u03c1) = (1 \u2212 |p|)\u03c1 + p1 X\u03c1X + p2 Y \u03c1Y + p3 Z\u03c1Z.\nThen the private classical capacity of Np satisfies\nCp (Np ) \u2264 1 \u2212 H(|p|),\nwhere |p| = p1 + p2 + p3 .\nProof\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nLetting \u03b1i = pi /|p|, we have\nZ\nY\nX\n,\n(\u03c1) + \u03b13 N|p|\n(\u03c1) + \u03b12 N|p|\nNp (\u03c1) = \u03b11 N|p|\n\nWe have studied the capacity of a quantum channel for\nprivate classical communication when assisted by symmetric channel of an arbitrary size. For a general channel, we found a single letter formula that, unfortunately,\ninvolves an optimization over an auxiliary space that is\na prior unbounded. For degradable channels, we further\nshowed that this optimization can be performed explicitly, and in fact the ss-private capacity of such a channel\nis exactly equal to its single-letter optimized coherent information. Using this fact, together with the convexity of\nthe ss-capacity for general channels, we showed how to\nfind upper bounds on the (unassisted) private capacity\nof a general channel, and provided such bounds for two\nchannels of interest for quantum key distribution.\nThe most important question we have left unanswered\nis whether it is possible to bound the dimension of the\n\n\f8\nsymmetric channel necessary to achieve the optimum of\nthe ss-capacity formula found in Theorem 5. This could\nallow very tight bounds on the unassisted capacity. In\nfact, we are unaware of any channel for which the ssprivate capacity and unassisted private capacity differ,\nand the conjecture that they are the same is equivalent\nto the additivity of the unassisted capacity, Cp .\nWe note that for both the independent amplitude and\nphase noise and the depolarizing channel, the upper\nbounds are the convex hull of a bound based on decomposition into dephasing channels, which is strongest in\nthe low noise regime, and a decompostion into amplitude\ndamping channels, which is stronger in the high noise\nregime. This suggests that the best collective attacks on\nquantum key distribution protocols will be qualitatively\ndifferent in the high and low noise regimes.\nIt is an interesting question whether there are zero capacity degradable channels that are not antidegradable. This\npossibility is intriguing, since the best known bounds on\nthe zeros of the capacity of most channels come from\na no-cloning argument (which is essentially to observe\nthat the channel is antidegradable), but these bounds\nare usually not particularly close to the corresponding\n\n[1] C.

Such a channel would also be useful for\nimproving estimates on CDM for general channels.\nFinally, this work demonstrates (along with [5] ) that\nassistance from a symmetric side channel is a \"nice\" resource, in the sense that it provides a marked simplification over the unassisted case for the private capacity.\nFurther examples of nice resources are free EPR pairs,\nwhich lead to the single-letter formula for the entanglement assisted capacity of [22, 23], and PPT-preserving\noperations, which dramatically simplify the theory of entanglement manipulations [24, 25]. What are the other\n\"nice\" resources?\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI am grateful to Debbie Leung, John Smolin, Andreas\nWinter, and Charlie Bennett for helpful conversations,\nto the Institute for Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo, where this work was initiated, and the\nUnited Kingdom Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council for financial support.\n\nA.
