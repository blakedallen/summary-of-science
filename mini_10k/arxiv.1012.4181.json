Introduction\nA renewed interest in the Boltzmann constant is related to the possible redefinition of the\nInternational System of Units (SI) [1-12]. A new definition of the kelvin would fix the value of the\nBoltzmann constant to a value determined by The Committee on Data for Science and Technology\n(CODATA). Currently, the value of the Boltzmann constant kB essentially relies on a single acoustic\ngas thermometry experiment by Moldover et al. published in 1988 [13, 14] (to avoid confusion with k\ngenerally reserved to the wave vector, we denote the Boltzmann constant by kB throughout this\n\npaper). The current relative uncertainty on kB is 1.7 \u00d7 10\u22126 [15]. Besides some projects following\nMoldover's approach [16-19], an alternative approach based on the virial expansion of the ClausiusMossotti equation and measurement of the permittivity of helium is very promising [20-25]. Since\n2004 we have developed a new approach based on laser spectroscopy in which kB is determined by a\nfrequency measurement. The principle [26, 27] consists in recording the Doppler profile of a wellisolated absorption line of an atomic or molecular gas in thermal equilibrium in a cell. This profile\nreflects the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of velocities along the laser beam axis. In a first\n1\n\nAuthor to whom any correspondence should be addressed.\n\n1\n\n\fexperiment we have demonstrated the potential of this new approach [28-30], on an ammonia\nrovibrational line. We were soon followed by at least four other groups who started similar\nexperiments on CO2, H2O, acetylene and rubidium [31-35].\nIn this paper, we present the large thermostat used to control the gas temperature and the new\nspectrometer developed to record the \u03bd2 saQ(6,3) rovibrational line of ammonia both by linear and\nsaturated absorption spectroscopy. We report on the first measurement of the Boltzmann constant by\nlaser spectroscopy with a statistical uncertainty below 10 ppm and give a first evaluation of the\nuncertainty budget, which shows that the effect of the hyperfine structure of the probed line needs to\nbe taken into account.\n2. The experimental setup\nThe principle of the experiment consists in recording the linear absorption of a rovibrational ammonia\nline in the 10 \u03bcm spectral region, the ammonia gas being at thermal equilibrium in a cell. The width\nof such a line is dominated by the Doppler width due to the molecular velocity distribution along the\nprobe laser beam. A complete analysis of the line shape which can take into account collisional\neffects (including pressure broadening and the Lamb-Dicke-Mossbauer (LDM) narrowing), hyperfine\nstructure, saturation of the molecular transition, optical depth, etc. leads to a determination of the\nDoppler width and thus to kB . The e-fold half-width of the Doppler profile, \u0394\u03c9D , is given by:\n\u0394 \u03c9D\n\n2 kBT\n\n, where \u03c90 is the angular frequency of the molecular line, c is the velocity of light, T\n\u03c90\nmc 2\nis the temperature of the gas and m is the molecular mass. Uncertainty on kB is limited by that on\n=\n\nmc 2 h (directly deduced from atom interferometry experiments [36-38]), on atomic mass ratios\n\u0394\u03c9D\nmeasured in ion traps [39], on h the Planck constant, on T, and on the ratio\n.\n\u03c90\nThe probed line is the \u03bd2 saQ(6,3) rovibrational line of the ammonia molecule 14NH3 at the frequency\n\u03bd = 28 953 693 .9 (1) MHz . This molecule was chosen for two main reasons: a strong absorption\nband in the 8-12 \u03bcm spectral region of the ultra-stable spectrometer that we have developed for several\nyears and a well-isolated Doppler line to avoid any overlap with neighbouring lines [40]. The\nexperiment requires a fine control of: (i) the laser intensity sent in the absorption cell; (ii) the laser\nfrequency which is tuned over a large frequency range to record the linear absorption spectrum; (iii)\nthe temperature of the gas which has to be measured during the experiment.\n2.1. The spectrometer\nThe spectrometer (Figure 1) is based on a CO2 laser source which operates in the 8-12 \u03bcm range. For\nthis experiment, important issues are frequency stability, frequency tunability and intensity stability of\nthe laser system. The laser frequency stabilization scheme is described in reference [41]: a sideband\ngenerated with a tunable electro-optic modulator (EOM) is stabilized on an OsO4 saturated absorption\nline detected on the transmission of a 1.6-m long Fabry-Perot cavity. The laser spectral width\nmeasured by the beat note between two independent lasers is smaller than 10 Hz and the laser exhibits\nfrequency instability of 0.1 Hz ( 3 \u00d7 10\u221215 ) for a 100 s integration time.\nSince its tunability is limited to 100 MHz, our CO2 laser source is coupled to a second EOM which\ngenerates two sidebands SB- and SB+ of respective frequencies \u03bd SB + = \u03bd L + \u03bd EOM and\n\n\u03bd SB\u2212 = \u03bd L \u2212 \u03bd EOM on both sides of the fixed laser frequency, \u03bd L . The frequency \u03bd EOM is tunable\nfrom 8 to 18 GHz. The intensity ratio between these two sidebands and the laser carrier is about 10-4.\nAfter the EOM, a grid polarizer attenuates the carrier by a factor 200 but not the sidebands which are\ncross-polarized.\n\n2\n\n\fFigure 1. Experimental setup for (a) linear absorption spectroscopy and (b) saturated\nabsorption spectroscopy (AM: amplitude modulation, FM: frequency modulation, EOM:\nelectro-optic modulator, FPC: Fabry Perot cavity, SB: sideband, Lock-in: lock-in amplifier).\n\nFigure 1.b represents the saturated absorption spectrometer used for recording the hyperfine structure\nof the rovibrational line and will be described in section 3. Figure 1.a represents the linear absorption\nspectrometer. A Fabry-Perot cavity (FPC) with a 1 GHz free spectral range and a finesse of 150 is\nthen used to drastically filter out the residual carrier and the unwanted SB+ sideband and to stabilize\nthe intensity of the transmitted sideband SB-. In order to keep the laser intensity constant at the\nentrance of the cell during the whole experiment, the transmitted beam is split in two parts with a\n50/50 beamsplitter: one part feeds a 37-cm long ammonia absorption cell for spectroscopy (probe\nbeam B) while the other is used as a reference beam (reference beam A). The reference signal A\nintensity which gives the intensity of the sideband SB- is compared and locked to a very stable\nvoltage reference (stability better than 10 ppm) by acting on the length of the FPC. A suitable\nintensity discriminator is obtained when the FPC is tuned so that the sideband frequency lies on the\nslope of the resonance. The absorption length of the cell can be adjusted from 37 cm (in a single pass\nconfiguration) to 3.5 m (in a multi-pass configuration). Both the reference beam (A) and the probe\nbeam (B) which cross the absorption cell are amplitude-modulated at f1 = 40 kHz via the 8-18 GHz\nEOM for noise filtering and signals are obtained after demodulation at f1. The probe beam (B) signal\nthen gives the absorption signal of the molecular gas recorded with a constant incident laser power\ngoverned by the stabilization of signal A. The sideband is tuned close to the desired molecular\nresonance and scanned over 250 MHz to record the Doppler profile.\n2.2. The thermostat\nThis experiment requires a thermostat to maintain the spectroscopic cell at a homogenous temperature\n[42]. The absorption cell sits in a large thermostat filled with an ice-water mixture, in order to set its\n\n3\n\n\f(\n\ntemperature close to 273.15 K. The thermostat is a large stainless steel box 1.2 \u00d7 0.8 \u00d7 0.8 m 3\n\n)\n\nthermally isolated by a 10-cm thick insulating wall (see Figure 2). The absorption cell\n(33 \u00d7 18 \u00d7 9 cm 3 ) , placed at the centre of the thermostat, is a stainless steel vacuum chamber ended\nwith two anti-reflective coated ZnSe windows. From these windows, pumped buffer pipes extend out\nof the thermostat walls. They are closed on the external other side with room temperature ZnSe\nwindows. Vacuum prevents heat conduction and water condensation on windows.\n\nFigure 2. Absorption cell inside the ice-water thermostat.\n\nThe cell temperature and thermal gradients are measured with long stems 25 \u03a9 Standard Platinum\nResistance Thermometers (SPRTs) calibrated at the triple point of water and at the gallium melting\npoint. Those SPRTs are compared to a low temperature dependence resistance standard in an accurate\nresistance measuring bridge. The resulting temperature accuracy measured close to the cell is 1 ppm\nwith a noise of 0.2 ppm after 40 s of integration. For longer integration times, temperature drifts of the\ncell remain below 0.2 ppm/h. The melting ice temperature homogeneity close to the cell has been\ninvestigated. Reproducible residual gradients parallel to the cell walls have been measured: the vertical\n\u2013 resp. horizontal (both directions) \u2013 gradient is equal to 0.05 mK/cm ie 0.17 ppm/cm\u2013 resp. 0.03\nmK/cm ie 0.1 ppm/cm \u2013 leading to an overall temperature inhomogeneity along the cell below 5 ppm.\nThese residual temperature gradients probably come from the difficulty to keep a homogeneous\nmixture surrounding the cell. Finally, we conclude that the temperature in the experiment is\nT=273.1500 (7) K.\n3. Hyperfine structure of the ammonia line\nThe saQ(6,3) line (J = 6 and K = 3 are respectively the quantum numbers associated with the total\norbital angular momentum and its projection on the molecular symmetry axis) has been chosen\nbecause it is a well-isolated rovibrational line with long-lived levels (natural width of the order of a\nfew Hz). However, owing to the non-zero spin values of the N and H nuclei, an unresolved hyperfine\nstructure is present in the Doppler profile of the rovibrational line and is responsible for a broadening\nof the line which is related to the relative position and strength of the individual hyperfine\n\n4\n\n\fcomponents. The relative increase of the linewidth due to this hyperfine structure scales as the square\n\u0394\nof the ratio hyp\n(where \u0394 hyp is the global spread of the overall hyperfine structure and\n\u0394\u03bd Dopp\n\u0394\u03bd D = \u0394\u03c9D 2\u03c0 , the Doppler width) which results in a relatively small influence. In the case of the\nprobed ammonia line, we will see that the hyperfine structure extension of the stronger components is\nof the order of 50 kHz. However, weaker lines around \u00b1600 kHz away from the main structure must\nbe considered as they actually give the largest contribution. For a Doppler width of about 50 MHz, the\nimpact may be a few ppm. For this reason, it is necessary to have a good knowledge of that structure\nin order to take it into account in the line shape analysis.\n\n3.1. Description of the hyperfine interactions\nThe hyperfine Hamiltonian of ammonia is very well-known [43-45]. The hyperfine structure of the\nsaQ(6,3) line is in part due to the interaction between the nitrogen nuclear quadrupole moment and the\ngradient of the electric field at the nucleus. Spin-rotation terms come from the interaction between the\nmagnetic field induced by the molecular rotation and the magnetic moment of the nitrogen nucleus\nand the hydrogen nuclei. The other magnetic hyperfine terms are the spin-spin interactions between N\nand H atoms or between H atoms themselves. The strength of these interactions is characterized by\ncoupling constants usually noted eQq (N quadrupole constant), R (N spin-rotation constant), S (H spinrotation constant), T (N-H spin-spin constant) and U (H-H spin-spin constant) according to notations\nfirst introduced by Kukolich [46]. Those constants are experimentally accessible. There are two sets of\nsuch constants for the fundamental and the upper rovibrational levels. Since the nitrogen nuclear spin\nis IN=1, each rovibrational level is split in 3 sub-levels F1 = (7, 6, 5) whereJJGF1 Jis\nG the\nJJG modulus of the\nsum of the orbital angular momentum and the spin of the nitrogen nucleus, F1 = J + I N . Then, each of\n\n(\n\n)\n\nthese sub-levels is again split in 4 sub-levels characterized by ( F1 , F ) where F = F1 \u00b1 1 , F1 \u00b1 3 is\n2\n2\nJG JJG G G\nthe modulus of the total angular momentum of the molecule, F = F1 + I . I is the total spin of the\nhydrogen nuclei. Its modulus is equal to 3/2 when K is a multiple of 3 [43].\n3.2. Saturation spectroscopy\nThe first hyperfine structures of ammonia were recorded on a molecular beam in the microwave\nregion [45-47] and led to a very good knowledge of the hyperfine constants in the ground vibrational\nlevel. Saturation spectroscopy of ammonia in the infrared leads to extra information on the upper\nvibrational level and was first performed in our group exhibiting both the electric and magnetic\nhyperfine structure of ammonia [48, 49], especially the six components of the asQ(8,7) line, fully\nresolved in a large 18-m long absorption cell [50]. From these measurements the variation of the\nquadrupole constant and spin-rotation constants with vibration could be obtained. For the present\nstudy a new experimental setup has been developed to record the hyperfine structure of the saQ(6,3)\nrovibrational line by saturated absorption spectroscopy (see figure 1.b). A 3-m long Fabry Perot cavity\nin a plano-convex configuration with a convex mirror radius of 100 m and a finesse of about 140 is\nfilled with ammonia. The red detuned SB- sideband generated by the 8-18 GHz EOM feeds this FabryPerot cavity. Two frequency modulations, f2 and f3 are required for this experiment. The modulation f2\nis used to stabilize the resonator frequency and can be applied either on one mirror mounted on a\npiezoelectric transducer or directly on the sideband frequency via the synthesizer which drives the 818 GHz EOM. The hyperfine components of the molecular line are detected in transmission of the\ncavity after demodulation at f3, a modulation applied on the sideband frequency via the EOM.\nExperimental parameters were first optimized to reduce as much as possible the linewidth in order to\nclearly observe the three main \u0394F1=0 lines. On the spectrum displayed on Figure 3, those main\ncomponents are well fitted by first derivatives of Lorentzians. Each line presents an unresolved\nstructure of 4 \u0394F=0 components. The modulation applied on the FPC for its frequency stabilisation\nwas at 11 kHz and the sideband modulation frequency for the molecular lines detection was equal to 1\nkHz with a depth of 2 kHz. The resolution was limited by laser intensity (around 1 mW inside the\nFabry-Perot cavity), gas pressure (10-5 mbar), modulation settings and transit time broadening. The\nabsorption signal was recorded over 200 kHz with 500 points and 30 ms integration time per point.\n\n5\n\n\fFigure 3. Main 'F1 =0 components of the \u03bd2 saQ(6,3) experimental spectrum (first\nharmonic detection) of 14NH3 fitted by three derivatives of a Lorentzian.\n\nThe experimental hyperfine spectrum of Figure 3 has been fitted with three derivatives of a Lorentzian\nlineshape. The adjustable parameters were the baseline offset and slope, the line central frequency, the\nintensity scale, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the Lorentzian (identical for the three\ncomponents), \u0394eQq and \u0394R , respectively the change in the quadrupole coupling constant and in the\nN spin-rotation constant between the upper and lower levels. Figure 3 illustrates the excellent\nagreement between experimental data and the numerical adjustment.\nThese 12 partially resolved lines are the strongest lines corresponding to an approximate selection rule\n\u0394J = \u0394F1 = \u0394F . In fact, 66 weaker transitions are also allowed and will contribute to the Doppler\nsignal and broaden it. Doppler-generated level crossing resonances can also be observed in saturated\nabsorption (but are not present in linear absorption spectroscopy) and give signal at the mean\nfrequency between the two involved transitions. Figure 4 compares (a) the \u03bd2 saQ(6,3) linear\nabsorption signal (recorded over 1 GHz using sideband amplitude modulation at f1=40 kHz and first\nharmonic detection, see section 2.1) and (b) the saturated absorption signal recorded over 1.4 MHz in\ntransmission of the 3-m long Fabry-Perot cavity. In the latter case, experimental parameters have been\nadjusted to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio in order to be able to observe the expected weak satellite\ntransitions. The cost to be paid is a degradation of the resolution and a slight distortion of the line\nshape. All frequency modulations were directly applied on the sideband. A 90 kHz frequency\nmodulation (60 kHz depth) was used for the resonator frequency stabilisation. For molecular line\ndetection a 10 kHz frequency modulation (30 kHz depth) was applied and first harmonic detection was\nused (with 30 ms integration time per point).\n\n6\n\n\fFigure 4. 14NH3 saQ(6,3) absorption line recorded by linear absorption (a) and at higher\nresolution by saturated absorption spectroscopy (b). At about 300 kHz on both sides of the\ncentral components Doppler-generated level crossings (between \u0394F=0 and \u0394F=\u00b11) are observed.\nAt about 600 kHz from the central resonances satellite weaker components are expected.\n\nUnder these experimental conditions, the three intense \u0394F1=0 multiplets are strongly broadened by the\nfrequency modulation. Signal of Doppler-generated level crossings (between \u0394F=0 and \u0394F=\u00b11) is\nclearly observed around \u00b1300 kHz from the central components. For a frequency detuning of about\n\u00b1600 kHz from the central components, signals coming from very weak \u0394F= \u00b11 satellite components\nand crossovers between \u0394F=0, \u0394F=+1 and \u0394F=-1 are hardly distinguishable.\n3.3. Analysis of the hyperfine structure\nClearly, the recorded spectra do not allow a determination of the whole set of hyperfine constants. In\nparticular, we can only measure the position of the center of gravity of each series of crossover\nresonances. However, the numerous studies of hyperfine structures in the ground vibrational level [4547], allows us to accurately fix the value of the hyperfine constants in the v=0 level:\neQq0= -4010 (1) kHz; R0= 6.75 (1) kHz; S0= -18.00 (1) kHz; T0= -0.85 (1) kHz and U0= -2.5 (3) Hz\nOnly rovibrational saturation spectroscopy provides information on the hyperfine constants in the v=1\nlevel. Our group has recorded in the past the asR(5,0) and asQ(8,7) lines of 14NH3 [48, 50] and also the\nasR(2,0) line of 15NH3 [49, 51]. These studies give the right order of magnitude of the hyperfine\nconstants in the upper level of the saQ(6,3) transition. The fit of the three main multiplets (Figure 3)\nrevealed that the uncertainty on their relative positions was 40 Hz and that this structure was only\nsensitive to the change of eQq and R between the lower and upper levels, leading to:\n\u0394eQq = eQq1 \u2212 eQq0 = \u2212196.8 ( 6 ) kHz and \u0394R = R1 \u2212 R0 = \u2212535 (6) Hz\n\n7\n\n\fThe other upper state constants were fixed with a conservative uncertainty of 10% to values estimated\nfrom our previous studies on the asR(5,0), asQ(8,7) and asR(2,0) lines:\nS1 = \u221217.5 (18 ) kHz; T1 = \u22120.9 (1) kHz and U1 = \u2212 2.5 ( 3) Hz\nIn principle, the position of the center of gravity of the crossover resonances (with respect to that of\nthe main lines) could give information on the hyperfine structure both in the lower and upper\nvibrational level. However, our experimental results, with an accuracy of 400 Hz on that position,\nalthough in good agreement with the ground vibrational level hyperfine constants, do not bring enough\nnew information.\nFigure 5 shows the hyperfine lines as sticks with relative intensities corresponding to the weak field\nregime. Apart from the strong main lines, the structure reveals manifolds around \u00b1600 kHz (see\nFigure 4) and \u00b1150 kHz (not investigated by saturated absorption spectroscopy).\n\nFigure 5. Stick spectrum of the 78 hyperfine components present in the Doppler profile.\nThe height of each stick reflects the intensity (in logarithm scale) of the corresponding hyperfine\ntransition in linear absorption.\n\nUsing the SPCAT program (developed by H. Pickett, Jet Propulsion Laboratory [52]), as well as a\nhomemade saturation spectroscopy simulation program, we checked very carefully how the positions\nof the lines and their intensities in linear absorption are affected by a change of the hyperfine\nconstants. This showed that the present knowledge of the hyperfine constants gives a very strong\nconstraint on the hyperfine structure in the Doppler profile of the saQ(6,3), both frequency- and\nintensity-wise.\nAs a result of the uncertainty on the values of the hyperfine constants, an uncertainty of 150 Hz on the\ncenter of gravity of the crossovers situated around \u00b1300 kHz is deduced. The corresponding\n\n8\n\n\funcertainty on the intensities in linear absorption stays below 0.15%. These two effects will fix the\nuncertainty on the correction due to the hyperfine structure to be applied for the determination of the\nDoppler width and thus kB .\n4. The Boltzmann constant measurement\n\n4.1. Doppler broadening measurement\n4.1.1. Absorption line shape\nWe consider the case of an optically thick medium under low saturation for which the absorption\ndP ( z, \u03c9 )\n1\ncoefficient for the laser power given by \u03ba (\u03c9 ) = \u2212\n(1) leads to the Lambert-Beer law\nP ( z,\u03c9 )\ndz\n\u2212\u03ba \u03c9 L\nP L , \u03c9 = P 0 e ( ) (for a total absorption length L) in the linear regime. At low pressure, the\n\n(\n\n)\n\n( )\n\nabsorption coefficient \u03ba (\u03c9 ) can be described by a Voigt profile which is the convolution of a\nGaussian shape related to the inhomogeneous Doppler broadening and of a Lorentzian shape whose\nhalf-width, \u03b3 ab , is the sum of all homogeneous broadening contributions. Since the natural width is\nnegligible for rovibrational levels, this homogeneous width is dominated by molecular collisions and\nthus, is proportional to pressure. In linear absorption spectroscopy and for an isotropic distribution of\nmolecular velocities it has been recently demonstrated that all transit effects are already included in\nthe inhomogeneous Doppler broadening and do not depend on the laser beam profile, a result which is\nnot intuitive [53]. At high pressure, the Lamb-Dicke-M\u00f6ssbauer (LDM) effect which results in a\nreduction of the Doppler width with pressure must be taken into account[54-58]. The absorption\ncoefficient is the Fourier transform of the correlation function of the optical dipole, denoted as \u03c6 (\u03c4 ) .\nFor the dimensionless absorbance A (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9 ) = \u03ba (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9 ) L one finds [53]:\nab\n\nA (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9ab ) =\n\n\u239b \u2212 Ea\n\u239e\n\u239c\nkBT \u239f\u23a0\n2\n\u239d\n4\u03c0\u03b1 Ndab\u03c9 L e\n\nZint\n\nRe \u222b\n\n+\u221e\n\n0\n\nab\n\nexp ( \u2212i\u03c9\u03c4 ) \u03c6 (\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 (2)\n\nE \u2212E\nthe angular frequency of the molecular line ( Ea\n=\nand Eb are the energies of the lower and upper rovibrational levels a and b in interaction with the laser\n\nwhere \u03c9 is the laser angular frequency, \u03c9 =\n\nb\n\na\n\nab\n\nelectromagnetic field, Ea < Eb ), \u03b1 = e\n\nN the density of molecules, dab =\n\n2\n\n( 4\u03c0\u03b5 0=c )\n\n\u03bcab\n\ne\n\nthe fine structure constant (e is the electron charge),\n\n( \u03bcab is the transition moment), and Zint the internal\n\npartition function.\nVarious theoretical models are available in the literature to describe the correlation function of the\noptical dipole, depending on the assumption made for the type of collisions between molecules [53,\n59]. Among them the Galatry profile [55] makes the assumption of so-called \"soft\" collisions between\nmolecules with the introduction of the diffusion coefficient D . The Galatry optical dipole correlation\nfunction is then:\n2\n\u23a1\n\u23a4\n1 \u239b \u0394\u03c9D \u239e\n\u03c6G (\u03c4 ) = exp \u23a2i\u03c9ab\u03c4 \u2212 \u03b3 ab\u03c4 + \u239c\n\u239f {1 \u2212 \u03b2 d\u03c4 \u2212 exp ( \u2212 \u03b2 d\u03c4 )}\u23a5 (3)\n2 \u239d \u03b2d \u23a0\n\u23a2\n\u23a5\n\u23a3\n\u23a6\nk T\nwhere \u0394\u03c9D is the half-width of the Doppler profile and \u03b2 d = B the coefficient of dynamical\nmD\nfriction (m is the molecular mass).

The Galatry profile evolves\n\u0394\u03c9D\nfrom a Lorentzian shape in the high pressure limit to a Voigt profile at low pressure.\nAt low pressures (small \u03b2d), we can use for the absorbance the first-order expansion in \u03b8:\nA (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9ab ) =\n\n\u239b Ea \u239e\n\u239c\u2212\n\u239f\nk T\n2\n4\u03b1 Ndab\u03c9 Le\u239d B \u23a0\n\n\u03c0 \u0394\u03c9D Zint\n\n\u03b8\n\u239b\n\u239e\n\u239c Re w (\u03b6 ) + 12 Re w1 (\u03b6 ) \u239f (5)\n\u239d\n\u23a0\n\nwhere w (\u03b6 ) and w1 (\u03b6 ) can be expressed in terms of the error function w (\u03b6 ) = e \u2212\u03b6 erfc ( \u2212i\u03b6 ) and\n2\n\nw1 (\u03b6 ) =\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03b6 ) + 4i\u03b6 (3 \u2212 \u03b6 ) exp ( \u2212\u03b6 ) erfc ( \u2212i\u03b6 ) .\n\u03c0\n\n8\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\nThe absorbance presents two terms the first one with w (\u03b6 ) corresponds to the Voigt profile when \u03b8 ie\n\n\u03b2d, tends to zero and the second one with w1 (\u03b6 ) is the LMD correction at first order. The expression\n\n(5) turns out to be a very good approximation of the true Galatry profile under our conditions (see\nbelow) and has been chosen in the fitting procedure as the reference line shape with the advantage of a\nmuch faster computing time.\n4.1.2. Measurement and data processing\n\n\u0394\u03c9 D\n(the main contribution to the width in our\n2\u03c0\nexperimental conditions) is of the order 50 MHz, has been recorded over 250 MHz by steps of 500\nkHz with a 30 ms time constant. The time needed to record a single spectrum is about 42 s. For 100%\nabsorption, the signal-to-noise ratio is typically 103. Since the signal-to-noise ratio was not high\nenough to leave the parameter \u03b2d as an adjustable parameter, it was kept proportional to the pressure\nduring the numerical adjustment procedure with a proportionality factor deduced from literature.\nFollowing the original Galatry theory (based on S. Chandrasekhar's Brownian motion theory) we used\n0\n= 0.15 cm 2s-1 at P0 = 1 atm , as\nthe standard diffusion coefficient, found to be equal to DNH\n3\n\nThe absorption profile, whose Doppler width \u0394\u03bd D =\n\nmeasured in ref [60] in a classical transport study. Spectroscopic measurements of this coefficient\nhave been performed for other lines of ammonia by A.S. Pine and co workers [61], leading to an\neffective value 20% smaller than a direct measurement by diffusion in the case of the \u03bd1 band of NH3.\nWe actually checked that the results of the fits did not change significantly with such a 20% variation\nof \u03b2d. Note that the LDM effect scales as the ratio of wavelength to mean free path. The mean free\npath between collisions, inversely proportional to the pressure, is related to the diffusion coefficient:\n3 \u03bb\n\u03b8\n0\nlm = 3m kBT \u00d7 DNH\n\u00d7 ( P0 P ) . It is then easy to find that \u03b8 =\nwhere\nappears as a\n2\n3\n12\n8\u03c0 lm\nscaling factor of the LDM term in expression (5). In our pressure conditions (from 2.5 down to 0.1 Pa)\nthis scaling factor varies from 6 \u00d7 10\u22125 to 2 \u00d7 10\u22126 .\nEven with \u03b2d kept constant in the fitting procedure, the signal-to-noise ratio of individual spectra was\nnot high enough to disentangle easily the homogeneous and the Doppler width when using usual\nfitting algorithms. If we rewrite \u03b3 ab as gP where P is the pressure, proportional to the amplitude of\nabsorption, g is a collisional parameter, a parameter shared by all spectra whatever the pressure is.\nThus, to make the fitting algorithm converge, we decided to adjust g in such a way that it is\nconstrained to a constant value for all the measured spectra. We first guess an initial realistic value.\nWe fit all the experimental spectra with a Galatry profile, constraining g to its guessed value, leaving\n\n10\n\n\f\u0394\u03c9D\n, P (both in the amplitude and \u03b3 ab ), \u03bd ab , and the baseline as adjustable parameters.\n2\u03c0\nWe expect \u0394\u03bd D to remain constant when the pressure varies, if g is chosen equal to the correct value.\n\nonly \u0394\u03bd D =\n\nWe then plot \u0394\u03bd D as a function of P and record the slope s given by a linear regression of this data.\nWe repeat this procedure for different values of g leading both to negative and positive slopes and\ncompute its estimated final value for which \u0394\u03bd D remains constant (within the noise) when the\npressure varies. The experimental data are finally fitted again constraining g to this final value. A\nweighted average of all the \u0394\u03bd D gives the best estimate of the Doppler width from which we deduce\nthe Boltzmann constant (see ref [62] for more details on the fitting procedure).\n4.2. Statistical uncertainty analysis\n4.2.1 First series of experiments\nAfter 16 hours of accumulation, 1420 spectra recorded at various pressures (from 0.1 Pa to 1.3 Pa)\nyielded a statistical uncertainty on kB of 37 ppm, limited by noise detection. The statistical\nuncertainty was calculated as the weighted standard deviation deduced from the dispersion of the\n1420 Doppler linewidth measurements [42, 62]. Weights were obtained as the inverse of the square of\nerror bars deduced from the adjustment of each spectrum. Note that those error bars are about 5 times\nsmaller than the standard deviation estimated from the total dispersion of the 1420 measurements. We\nalso estimated the error bar on the Doppler width of each spectrum from a computer based Bootstrap\nmethod [63]. The error bar obtained by this method is compatible within \u00b15% with the error bar\nobtained from the fitting procedure. The discrepancy observed between the Doppler width standard\ndeviation estimated from the dispersion of the 1420 spectra and the error bar of single Doppler width\nmeasurements confirmed by these methods has been attributed to slow drifts of the optical alignement\nof the laser beam in the absorption cell. Indeed the CO2 laser based spectrometer and the thermostated\ncell were located on two separate breadboards. Long term drifts of the optical alignement induce slow\nvariations of the amplitude of residual interference fringes on the optical path which are the main\nsource of the baseline instability. This low frequency effect is not observable on each individual\nspectrum but could affect the global dispersion of repeated measurements over a few hours.\n4.2.2. New optical arrangement\nTo overcome this long term instability, the thermostat and the spectrometer have been placed on a\nsingle optical table. Better optical alignement stability combined with improvement in the optical\nisolation and spatial filtering of the laser beam led to an efficient reduction and control over several\ndays of the residual interference fringes. To reduce statistical uncertainty we also chose to increase the\nmolecular absorbance \u03ba (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9ab ) L by recording spectra at higher pressures. A second series of 7171\nspectra has been recorded and fitted for pressures up to 2.5 Pa. A typical absorption line fitted with the\nexponential of a Galatry profile and normalized residuals are reported in Figure 6.\n\n11\n\n\fFigure 6.Absorption spectrum recorded at 1.3 Pa and normalized residuals of a non-linear\nleast-squares fit with the exponential of a Galatry profile Taylor expansion to first order in \u03b2d.\n\nIn addition, to take into better account the characteristics of the spectra, a weight of each individual\npoint is attributed by considering the local noise of the spectrum \u2013 this is directly related to the\nintensity noise on the photodetector which decreases strongly when the absorption changes from 0 to\nabout 100%. The values of the Doppler width of the 7171 spectra recorded over 70 hours are displayed\non Figure 7 and led to a mean Doppler half-width of: \u0394\u03bd D = 49.88590 (16) MHz (3.2 ppm ) leading to\na statistical uncertainty on the Boltzmann constant determination of 6.4 ppm (Figure 9 and Figure 9).\n\n12\n\n\fFigure 7. Doppler e-fold half-width of the saQ(6,3) NH3 absorption line versus pressure,\nafter fitting 7171 spectra with a Galatry profile Taylor expansion to first order in \u03b2d.\n\nNote that there is still a discrepancy between the Doppler width uncertainty estimated from\nmeasurements dispersion and the error bar on each point estimated either from a non linear regression\nor the Bootstrap method, but thanks to the improved long term stability of the optical alignement, this\ndiscrepancy has been reduced by a factor of 2. The 6.4 ppm error bar reflects dispersion of\nmeasurements which includes de facto the statistical uncertainty of individual measurements and\ninstabilities of the experiment. Two analyses have been performed to validate this statistical limitation.\nWe randomly divided our data set in four equal subsets of points (each randomly ordered) and\nanalyzed those sets independently to obtain four independant mean values of the Doppler e-fold halfwidth. The dispersion of these four values reported in Figure 8 is consistent with the statistical\nuncertainty of each data subset (twice larger than the 3.2 ppm obtained for 7171 spectra).\n\n13\n\n\f49.8864\n\nDoppler width(MHz)\n\n49.8862\n\n7171\nspectra\n\n1792 spectra\nnd\n2 sub-ensemble\n\n1793 spectra\nth\n4 sub-ensemble\n\n49.8860\n\n49.8858\n\n1792 spectra\nrd\n3 sub-ensemble\n\n49.8856\n\n49.8854\n\n1792 spectra\nst\n1 sub-ensemble\n\nFigure 8. Mean Doppler e-fold half-width and associated uncertainties for the 7171\nspectra and for four subsets of these data (3 sets of 1792 points and 1 set of 1793 points) each\nrandomly ordered.\n\nIn a second analysis, measurements of kB have been randomly ordered and the relative uncertainty\nhas been calculated as a function of \u03c4, where \u03c4 is the accumulated time of measurement (Figure 9).\nThe slope of both the red and black curve is proportional to one over the square root of \u03c4. This slope is\na good indication of a statistical limitation. The significant improvement in the standard deviation at\nfixed accumulation time is the conjunction of the better optical stability of the setup, the larger\npressure range and the new statistical analysis which also clearly stabilizes the fitting procedure and\nreduces the dispersion of the data.\n\n14\n\n\fFigure 9. Relative statistical uncertainty u( kB )/ kB of the Boltzmann constant\nmeasurement versus time for 1420 spectra recorded over 16 hours and 7171 spectra recorded\nover 70 hours leading respectively to statistical uncertainties of 37 ppm and 6.4 ppm.\n\n4.3. Systematic uncertainty analysis\nThe kB measurement can be affected by several systematic effects. In this section we have listed and\ninvestigated some of them: the hyperfine structure of the saQ(6,3) absorption line, the collisional\neffects, the modulation, the size or the shape of the laser beam, the temperature control of the\nabsorption cell, the non-linearity in the photodetector response and the saturation of the rovibrational\ntransition.\n4.3.1. The hyperfine structure\nSaturated absorption spectroscopy in complement with microwave spectroscopy has provided an\naccurate determination of spectroscopic parameters of the \u03bd2 saQ(6,3) line (see section 3). The impact\nof this hyperfine structure on the Doppler width measurement could finally be estimated. The method\nis straightforward: we sum Voigt profiles (or Galatry profiles) associated with the 78 hyperfine\ncomponents of the linear spectrum with positions and intensities precisely determined by the analysis\npresented in section 3. The resulting lineshape is then fitted by a unique Voigt (or Galatry) profile and\nthe difference with the \"true\" Doppler width is thus deduced. The 300 Hz uncertainty on the global\nspread of the overall hyperfine structure (twice that on the crossover positions) and the 0.15%\nuncertainty on the intensities result in a very precise determination of the correction to be applied on\n\u0394k B \u23a4\n= \u22128.71 ( 3) ppm , where 91% of the broadening comes from the weak\nthe value of kB :\n\u23a5\nkB \u23a6 hyp. struct .\ncomponents around \u00b1600 kHz .\n\n15\n\n\fThis precise evaluation does not take into account any possible differential saturation of the absorption\nbetween strong and weak hyperfine transitions. If any, the saturation will be much more important for\nstrong lines which would result in higher relative intensities of the weak lines and thus an additional\nbroadening of the whole Doppler envelope. In order to evaluate this effect, we recorded the Doppler\nsignal and alternatively measured the relative absorption at two different laser powers (0.3 and 0.9\n\u03bcW) by using optical attenuators either placed just before the photodetector or just before the\nabsorption cell, in order to test saturation effects for a constant detected laser intensity. The\nabsorptions were equal within 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 which gives an upper limit for the saturation parameter of\n3.6 \u00d7 10\u22123 at 1.3 Pa. This very small value is in good agreement with that expected with such laser\npowers, gas pressure and a typical size of the laser beam of a few mm. In the collisional regime, the\nsaturation parameter scales as the inverse of the square of the pressure. The associated relative\nbroadening stays below 0.3 ppm in the 0.25-2.5 Pa pressure range. Finally it has also been checked\nthat the choice of the individual lineshape (Voigt or Galatry) does not affect the correction on kB .\n\n4.3.2. The collisional effects\nThe 7171 spectra were fitted both with a Galatry (first order Taylor expansion) and a Voigt profile.\nThe relative pressure broadening varies from 6.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 to 6.2 \u00d7 10\u22123 in the 0.25-2.5 Pa pressure\nrange. A difference of 139 ppm is obtained on kB when fits of the 7171 spectra with either a Taylor\nexpansion of a Galatry profile or a Voigt profile are compared and this reflects the influence of the\nLDM effect at high pressure (remember that high pressure data have a stronger weight because of the\nbetter signal-to-noise ratio). This illustrates the critical role of the chosen line shape. Each point of\nFigure 10 shows the fractional difference obtained with the sub-ensemble of these 7171 spectra\nrecorded at pressures below a given Pmax. Figure 10 indicates that the LDM effect is responsible for a\nnarrowing of the Voigt profile leading to differences in the determination of kB equal or larger than\nthe current statistical uncertainty of 6.4 ppm (see section 4.2.2) for pressure ranges larger than 0.5 Pa.\nThus, recording spectra at pressures lower than 0.5 Pa would maintain the systematic error due to the\nLDM effect below 6.4 ppm, when using a Voigt profile. In addition the quadratic dependence of this\ndifference let us hope to rapidly reduce this effect at the level of 1 ppm.\n\n16\n\n\fFigure 10. relative difference on kB determination (dots) by fitting experimental spectra\nwith a Voigt ( kB Voigt) or a Galatry ( kB Galatry) profile when using the sub-ensemble of the spectra\nrecorded at pressures below Pmax. The solid line indicates the result obtained when fitting a\nsimulated Galatry profile with a Voigt profile.\n\nApart from the Galatry profile, various theoretical models are available in the literature, depending on\nthe assumption made for the type of collisions between molecules [59]. The systematic effect due to\nthe \"soft\" collisions model chosen here to describe the LDM narrowing would need to be evaluated in\nour pressure range, by fitting data with other models which would require a precise knowledge of the\nspecific collision kernel. In our experimental conditions (as mentionned in section 4.1.2), the pressure\nbroadening \u03b3 ab cannot be directly fitted for each individual spectrum but is obtained by adjusting a\nunique g, constrained to a constant value for all the spectra. Thanks to new experimental\ndevelopments, we are now able to record accurate scans over 500 MHz. This will allow us in the near\nfuture to directly and accurately determine this homogeneous broadening for each individual\nspectrum. In particular, by this way the possible contribution of residual impurities in the absorption\ncell could be taken into account. This will also permit a more precise study of different line shape\nmodels. However we expect the present study to give the right order of magnitude of the LDM\nnarrowing contribution to the determination of kB , whatever the chosen collisional model.\n4.3.3. Other systematic effects\nAttempts to observe other systematic effects due to the modulation and the geometry of the laser\nbeam were unsuccessful at a 10 ppm level. Let us remind that it has been shown theoretically that the\nline shape does not depend on the laser beam geometry [53].\n\n17\n\n\fTaking into account both temperature inhomogeneity and stability (detailed in section 2.2) of the\nthermostat, no systematic effect due to the temperature control is expected on kB at a 2.5 ppm level.\nLaser power related systematic effects due to both non-linearity in the detection set-up and Saturation\nbroadening of the molecular absorption were investigated too. It is worth reminding that the\nsaturation of the photodetector occurs above 1 mW while the operating conditions are below 1 \u03bcW.\nBoltzmann constant measurements were performed at different saturation parameters (for laser power\nranging from 0.5 to 1\u03bcW at the entrance of the absorption cell). Non-linearity in the photodetection\nresponse was evaluated by recording spectra and determining kB at different detected powers using\nattenuators placed straight before the photodetector, in order to work at constant molecular transition\nsaturation. No systematic effects were observed at a 10 ppm level for these two potential causes of\nsystematic effect\nIn the following table, are summarized the various contributions to the linewidth with their present\nuncertainty which are systematic effects to be taken into account for a proper evaluation of the\nDoppler width. In fact, for several non-observable effects only an upper limit estimated from the\nsignal-to-noise ratio can be given. Let us remind that the uncertainties must be doubled when the\nerror budget of kB is concerned.\n\nTable 1.

Clearly the line shape model is up to now the critical point in this experiment. However, we are\nconfident that the next generation of experiments will lead to a better control of this effect, thanks to\nan operation within a ten times lower pressure range and to a more accurate fit of individual spectra.\n\n18\n\n\fThe value of the Boltzmann constant deduced from these 7171 points, corrected for the systematic\neffect due to the hyperfine structure (see section 4.3.1.), is kB = 1.38080 ( 20 ) \u00d7 10 \u221223 J.K \u22121 . The\ncombined standard uncertainty is 144 ppm and this value of kB deviates from that recommended in\n2007 by the CODATA by 106 ppm [15].\n5. Conclusion and perspectives\n\nRecent experimental developments to reduce the statistical uncertainty on the Boltzmann constant\ndetermined by linear absorption of ammonia around 10 \u03bcm have been reported. New measurements of\nthe Doppler broadening of the \u03bd2 saQ(6,3) rovibrational line of ammonia close to 273.15 K led to a\nstatistical uncertainty of 6.4 ppm on kB (after a cumulative measurement time of 70 hours). The\nimprovement on the statistical uncertainty of the Boltzmann constant measurement throughout time at\nthe Laboratoire de Physique des Lasers as well as results from other groups [31,32,35] are illustrated\nin Figure 11.\n\nFigure 11. Statistical uncertainty on the Boltzmann constant measured by laser\nspectroscopy : (\u2022) at LPL since the first experiments in 2004 [28, 29, 40, 42, 62], (\u25bc) from\nYamada et al. [32], (\u25b2) from Casa et al. [31] and (\u2666) from Truong et al. [35].\n\nThis paper also presents a careful study of the influence of the hyperfine structure. Its role cannot be\nneglected at a few ppm level but it can now be easily taken into account with a negligible residual\nuncertainty.\n\n19\n\n\fThe determination of kB by laser spectroscopy is affected by several systematic effects. Some of them\nhave been investigated leading to a provisory conclusion that the main source of systematic effects\ncomes from collisional effects. Their contribution to the linewidth is clearly model-dependent.\nPresently the most accurate value for the Boltzmann constant that can be deduced from Doppler\nspectroscopy at LPL is the one obtained from measurements performed at very low pressure, below\n1.3 Pa (see section 4.2.1.). From the present paper, a correction due to the hyperfine structure of the\nprobed rovibrational line needs to be applied. This correction is of -8.71(3) ppm leading to a refined\ndetermination of kB = 1.380704 ( 69 ) \u00d7 10 \u221223 J.K \u22121 . The combined standard uncertainty is dominated\nby two terms [42]: the statistical uncertainty of 37 ppm and the collisional effects modelisation\nsystematic uncertainty of 34 ppm. This measurement of kB is in agreement with the value\nrecommended in 2007 by the CODATA, 1.3806504 ( 24 ) \u00d7 10 \u221223 J.K \u22121 , within 39 ppm [15].\nThe detailed comparison between the Voigt and the Galatry profile convinced us that the residual\nerror will be reduced at the ppm level if the pressure in the absorption chamber stays below 0.5 Pa.\nThis major conclusion motivates the next evolution of the experimental setup. A new multi-pass\nHerriott cell (37 m absorption length) will be installed to record spectra at pressures ten times lower\nthan in the experiment presented here while keeping the same signal-to-noise ratio. In this new\npressure range (0.025-0.25 Pa) we expect to control the collisional effects at the ppm level. In\naddition, a new thermostat in which the absorption cell is surrounded by a copper thermal shield\nlocated itself in a stainless steel enclosure has been recently developped and installed. A cell\ntemperature inhomogeneity and stability of 1 ppm over 1 day has been already demonstrated [42]. To\nenable a variable working temperature, useful for a complete analysis of temperature dependent\nsystematic effects, the melting ice will be replaced by a 1 m3 mixture of water and alcohol,\nmaintained at a desired temperature. A cryostat actively coupled to a heat exchanger will permit a\nregulation of the liquid bath temperature from +10\u00b0C down to \u201310\u00b0C. In this temperature range, the\nrelative uncertainty associated with the interpolated temperature measured by the SPRTs used\nremains within 1 ppm. Finally, we plan to perform a more refined study of the possible influence of\nthe modulation distortion connected to the non-linearity of the photodetector.\nThese future developments should lead to a new value for the Boltzmann constant with an accuracy\nof a few ppm which is the main goal of this project. This will be worthily compared to the value\nobtained by the acoustic method and thus hopefully contribute significantly to the CODATA value.\nThe determination of the Boltzmann constant with different methods at a few ppm is a prerequisite\nfor a new definition of the Kelvin by fixing the value of kB .\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work is funded by the Laboratoire National de M\u00e9trologie et d'Essais and by European\nCommunity (EraNet/IMERA).
