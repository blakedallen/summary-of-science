For moderate change rates, fitness optimisation\nthrough evolution is still possible.\n\nKeywords: Evolution theory, stone age, cultural innovation, computer simulation\nShennan (2001), based on a biological model of Peck et al (1997), showed\nthat in large populations, evolution in a computer model can evolve to a higher\naverage fitness than in a smaller population. This influence of demography may\nbe relevant for an easier spread cultural innovation in homo sapiens 104 . . . 105\nyears ago. Now we test whether this effect survives if the environment changes\nand if thus also the combination of optimal traits giving the highest fitness\nchanges continuously during the evolution.\nEach individual j in the Shennan model has L traits xij with real numbers\n\u2212\u221e < xij < \u221e and deviations dij = abs(xij \u2212 ei ) from the optimal values ei .\nThe fitness or fertility is\nwj = exp[\u2212\n\nL\nX\n\ndij ] .\n\ni=1\n\nWe start the simulations with all ei = xij (Shennan (2001) set all ei to zero\npermanently). Then at each sweep through the population of N individuals\n(constituting one time step or generation), each individual j gives birth to one\noffspring (baby, pupil) with probability wj , while with probability 1\u2212wj instead\nthe best-fitted individual produces one offspring. Thereafter, all adults die, and\nthe offspring become the new adults. The selection of the best-fitted, instead of\nany other, individual avoids the extremely low and perhaps unrealistic fitnesses\nof Shennan's simple model and follows the spirit of his oblique transmission of\nculture by teachers instead of parents. Also, at each time step each individual\nhas one randomly selected x-value changed by an amount taken randomly between \u00b10.04, which represents a useful or damaging innovation, simpler than\nShennan (2001) and Peck et al (1997).\nThe highest curve in our upper figure shows for L = 100 the resulting fitness,\naveraged over all individuals and then over the second half of all time steps (geometric mean over the population, arithmetic mean over time). As in Shennan\n(2001), larger populations are seen to lead to larger overall fitness.\n1\n\n\fNow as a new aspect in the spirit of Cebrat et al (2009) we introduce a\nchanging environment by changing, with probability R at each time step, also\nall optimal values ei , i = 1, 2, . . . L by random amounts also inhomogeneously\ndistributed between \u00b10.08. For example, in the migration of homo sapiens the\ntechniques to walk on snow and ice became helpful only rather late, while dark\nskin became disadvantageous in the Arctic (see also Gibbons 2010).\nOur figure shows reasonable reductions of the fitness for small R while for\nR > 0.01 not much is left. Thus for survival, environmental change rates should\nbe not higher than the innovation rate per individual, which is 1/L = 0.01\naccording to our above rule and our choice L = 100. Indeed, in the lower part\nof the figure for L = 10, we got reasonable survival even for R = 1. Fig. 2a\nshows more systematically the dependence on L for larger L.\nFor sexual reproduction, as in Peck et al (1997), we divide the population\ninto men and women; now the two fittest members of the population give birth if\nthey happen to be of different sex. Each of the L traits of the child is randomly\nselected from father or from mother, with probability 1/2 each. The results are\nshown in Fig.2b.\nChildren learn not only from their parents (vertical transmission) but also\nfrom biologically unrelated adult teachers (oblique transmission). For the latter\ncase we replace the parent (asexual case) or one of the parents (sexual case)\nby a randomly selected teacher from whom the child learns half of the traits.\nFig.3 shows this oblique transmission; for the sexual case a surprising minimum\nnear L = 2500 appears for some R; Fig.3c shows the results for R = 0.001 on a\nlogarithmic scale.\nWe checked with numerous different random number seeds the gap at L =\n3500 in this minimum of Fig.3c as a function of time. We found that for short\ntimes the fitness equilibrates to 0.86 \u00b1 0.02, and then jumps down to (nearly)\nzero. The jump time varies from 4 to several thousand. This behaviour is similar\nto homogenous nucleation in metastable states, as for example in supersaturated\nwater vapour. The direction of this rapid transition is, however, opposite to\nthe rapid improvement in human civilisation about 45,000 years ago (Owen et\nal 2009). (For other L between 150 and 25,000 the results usually are more\nsmooth).\nThis simulation was triggered by the course of Prof. S. L. Kuhn at Cologne\nUniversity, winter term 2009/10, where the Shennan paper was read. We thank\nProfs. Shennan, J. Richter and P.M.C. de Oliveira for encouragement and suggestions, and CNPq for support of the Brazilian author.\nAppendix\nTwo variants of the above asexual model have also been investigated: Instead\nof the above one innovation per person at each iteration, one may have one\ninnovation for each of the L traits of each person at each iteration (\"per person\"\nor \"per trait\"). And instead of the fitness being exp(\u2212D) for one person, one\nmay take it as exp(\u2212D/L), i.e. \"with\" instead of \"without\" division. All four\ncombinations are shown in the last figure:\n\n2\n\n\fper\nper\nper\nper\n\ntrait, without: +\ntrait, with: x\nperson, with: stars\nperson, without: squares\n\nthe last one being the above standard case. These symbols refer to a population\nof 1000 at an environmental change rate of 0.003. Thus per trait instead of per\nperson decreases the fitness, and with division by L quite trivially the fitness\nstrongly increases. With a rate 0.3 and a ten times larger population, the two\noverlapping lines in the figure are obtained, showing that per person or per trait\ndoes not matter much for this higher change rate.\nIf the division by L is applied to the gap in Fig.3c for oblique sexual transmission, then the fitness stays near 0.98 for L between 1000 and 5000, with no\ngap.\nFinally we let the population size fluctuate by a Verhulst factor, instead of\nkeeping it constant, for the standard case \"per person\" and \"without division\".\nThus for each of the 10,000 iterations we went again through each individual\nand let it die with probability N/K where n is the current population and\nK = 1000 is usually called the carrying capacity. If the individual survives this\n\"logistic\" danger, it produces one additional offspring. We found that the actual\npopulations fluctuate near K/2 and that about half of them die out before the\n10,000 iterations are finished, if K is about 16 (and L is 10 or 100, for R between\n0.001 and 1; L = 1000, 10,000 and 100,000 for R = 0.003 only.) Thus random\nfluctuations will hardly kill a population of more than a dozen individuals. Note\nthat we include also the dangers from the random changes in the environment,\nbut not catastrophes like volcano eruptions not described by our rather smooth\nenvironmental changes.\nS.
