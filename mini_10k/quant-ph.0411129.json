Contrarily, in the opposite case of \u03b3d \u226b \u03b3n , \u03c7(3) suffers the\nsize-enhancement effect and becomes proportional to the system size.\nPACS numbers: 42.65.-k, 42.50.Fx\n\nThere has been much interest in optical responses of finite-sized systems. When the eigenstates of the system are\ndelocalized in space, the transition dipole moment between the ground state and the lowest excited state scales as\nN 1/2 , where N is a parameter representing the system size [1]. This N 1/2 scaling rule is the origin of unique optical\nresponses of finite-sized systems, such as size-enhancement of third-order optical susceptibility, \u03c7(3) [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].\nIn conventional theories on the size-effects of optical responses, whereas the size-dependences on eigenenergies and\ntransition dipole moments were carefully taken into account, damping effects were often treated rather crudely by\nsimply introducing phenomenological damping constants. However, because the system size would affect not only\neigenenergies and transition dipole moments but also damping rates, more rigorous treatment on the damping effects\nare desired. Particularly, when the material is irradiated by resonant light fields, the magnitude of the optical\nnonlinearity is strongly sensitive to the damping rates. It is therefore indispensable to exclude phenomenology on the\ndamping effects for quantitative evaluation of optical nonlinearity.\nHere, targeting solid-state nonlinear optical devises in mind, we investigate the optical response of finite sized systems under a situation where the system suffers three different damping mechanisms: radiative dissipation, dephasing,\nand nonradiative dissipation. The latter two damping mechanisms are brought about by coupling to environmental degrees of freedom such as phonons. The effects of nonradiative dampings have been considered in detail in\nRef. [6], but the damping constants are introduced by hand, independently of the model. (The radiative damping is\nincorporated through the self-consistent Maxwell fields in their formalism [7].) Spano et. al. pioneered the theories\nwithout phenomenology on the damping effects, where the damping dynamics of the system is explicitly defined in\nthe model [4, 5]. As for nonradiative damping effects, they introduced the homogeneous dephasing alone and no dissipation was explicitly treated. Although particular aspects of damping effects on the size-dependence of nonlinearity\nhave been considered, the interplay of different damping mechanisms is still a subject of importance. To reveal the\noverall effects brought about by three different damping mechanisms, it is indispensable to treat the radiative and\nnonradiative dampings on equal footing and to make a clear distinction between dephasing and nonradiative dissipation. It is shown here that the third-order nonlinear response is drastically dependent on the ratio of two kinds of\nnonradiative damping rates: the ratio determines whether the size-enhancement of nonlinear response occurs or not.\nThis fact implies that particular damping conditions could provide a novel resource for size-enhancement of nonlinear\nresponse.\nThe objective of this study is to investigate the third-order nonlinear optical response, taking account of different\ndamping mechanisms explicitly. As a simplest model of a nonlinear optical system with finite size, we consider a\nsuperradiant system composed by N identical two-level systems (hereafter referred to as \"atoms\") with transition\nfrequency \u03a9 [8], which suffers, individually at each atom, both dephasing and nonradiative dissipation. Such damping\nmechanisms become particularly significant if the atoms are embedded in a solid-state environment, e. g., quantum\ndots in a microcavity. The equation of motion for the density matrix \u03c1 of atoms is the superradiant master equation [4,\n5, 9] supplemented with the terms describing dephasing and nonradiative dissipation [10]. It is given, omitting h\u0304 and\n\u03bc (transition dipole moment) for notational simplicity, by\nd\u03c1\n= \u2212i[H0 + Hint (t), \u03c1] + (Lr + Ld + Ln )\u03c1,\ndt\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: ikuzak@aria.mp.es.osaka-u.ac.jp\n\n(1)\n\n\f2\nH0 =\n\nX\n\n\u03a9s\u2020j sj ,\n\n(2)\n\nj\n\nHint (t) = E(t)S \u2020 + E \u2217 (t)S,\n\u03b3r\n(2S\u03c1S \u2020 \u2212 S \u2020 S\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1S \u2020 S),\nLr \u03c1 =\n2\n\u03b3d X \u2020\nLd \u03c1 = \u2212\n[s sj , [s\u2020j sj , \u03c1]],\n2 j j\n\u03b3n X\n(2sj \u03c1s\u2020j \u2212 s\u2020j sj \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1s\u2020j sj ),\nLn \u03c1 =\n2 j\n\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n\nP\nwhere s\u2020j and sj are the Pauli creation and annihilation operators at jth atom, and S = j sj is the collective operator.\nE(t) represents the positive frequency part of the applied electric field, and the rotating wave approximation is used\nin Hint (t). \u03b3r , \u03b3d and \u03b3n represent the single-atom rates of radiative decay, dephasing, and nonradiative dissipation,\nrespectively. It is of note that the atoms interact with the electromagnetic field via the collective operator [see Eqs. (3)\nand (4)] whereas dephasing and nonradiative dissipations occurs independently in each atom [see Eqs. (5) and (6)].\nBased on this model, we investigate the linear and the third-order nonlinear optical responses. To the end of\ninvestigating up to third-order response, we are concerned with the following expectation values: hsi i, hsi sj i, hs\u2020i sj i,\nand hs\u2020i sj sk i, where the expectation value of an operator A is given by hAi = Tr{\u03c1A}. Remembering the fact that all\natoms are equivalent, the number of independent variables are greatly reduced. For example, it is apparent that hsi i\nis independent of the site index i. We use the following notations:\nhsi i = hsi,\n\u001a\n0\n(i = j)\nhsi sj i =\n,\nhssi (i 6= j)\n\u001a \u2020\nhs si (i = j)\nhs\u2020i sj i =\n,\nhs\u2020 s\u2032 i (i 6= j)\n(\n0\n(j = k)\nhs\u2020i sj sk i =\nhs\u2020 ssi (j 6= k, i = j or k) .\nhs\u2020 ss\u2032 i (i 6= j, j 6= k, k 6= i)\n\n(7)\n(8)\n(9)\n(10)\n\nd\nThe equation of motion for hAi is given, using Eq.

This feature was also observed in conventional theories on the nonlinear susceptibilities\nusing phenomenological damping constants [2, 3, 6].

In the following part of this study,\nwe discuss how \u03c7(3) depends on the relaxation parameters (\u03b3r , \u03b3d , \u03b3n ) and the number N of atoms. Recent nanotechnologies aim to fabricate clean quantum systems with long coherence times, and extensive efforts on suppressing \u03b3d\nand \u03b3n are being made. In the following part of this study, we restrict our attention to a case where \u03b3d and \u03b3n are\nwell suppressed and satisfy (\u03b3d , \u03b3n ) \u226a \u03b3r .\nFirstly, we discuss the limiting case of \u03b3d \u2192 0. In this limit, it is easily confirmed that hs\u2020 si = hs\u2020 s\u2032 i(=\n|fN,0,1 (\u03c9)|2 |E|2 ) and hs\u2020 ssi = hs\u2020 ss\u2032 i(= |fN,0,1(\u03c9)|2 fN \u22121,0,1 (\u03c9)|E|2 E). These equalities imply that N atoms respond\nto the electric field cooperatively, as a spin N/2 object. \u03c7(3) is reduced to the following form:\n(3)\n\n\u22121\n\u03c7\u03b3d \u21920 (\u03c9) = \u22122|fN,0,1(\u03c9)|2 fN,0,1 (\u03c9)fN \u22121,0,1 (\u03c9)f0,0,1\n(\u03c9).\n\n(27)\n\n(3)\n\nThis equation reveals that \u03c7\u03b3d \u21920 depends on the system size N only through the enhancement of \u03b3r . In the off(3)\n\nresonant frequency regions, \u03c7\u03b3d \u21920 \u2243 \u22122/(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03a9)3 , which is independent of N . Thus, in the limit of \u03b3d \u2192 0, the\noptical nonlinearity is essentially that of a single atom, except for minor corrections around the resonant frequency\nregion.\nNext, we consider a more general case of \u03b3d 6= 0. We should remark that, when (\u03b3d , \u03b3n ) \u226a \u03b3r is satisfied, hs\u2020 si and\n\u2020 \u2032\nhs s i are reduced to the following forms:\nN \u03b3d + N \u03b3n\n|fN,1,1(\u03c9)|2 |E|2\n\u03b3d + N \u03b3n\nN \u03b3n\n|fN,1,1 (\u03c9)|2 |E|2\nhs\u2020 s\u2032 i \u2243\n\u03b3d + N \u03b3n\nhs\u2020 si \u2243\n\n(28)\n(29)\n\nIn case of \u03b3d \u226a \u03b3n , all of hssi, hs\u2020 si, and hs\u2020 s\u2032 i are of the same order (\u223c |f |2 |E|2 ), and the nonlinear susceptibility\nis given by Eq. (27). Contrarily, in the opposite case of \u03b3d \u226b \u03b3n , hs\u2020 si becomes much larger than hssi and hs\u2020 s\u2032 i.\n(hs\u2020 si \u223c N |f |2 |E|2 , whereas hssi and hs\u2020 s\u2032 i \u223c |f |2 |E|2 .) Then, Eqs. (23) and (26) suggest that hs\u2020 ssi, hs\u2020 ss\u2032 i and\n\u03c7(3) become almost proportional to hs\u2020 si. Using the fact that hs\u2020 si is magnified by a factor (N \u03b3d + N \u03b3n )/(\u03b3d + N \u03b3n )\nin comparison with the \u03b3d \u2192 0 case, we obtain the following approximate expression of the third-order nonlinear\nsusceptibility:\n\u03c7\u0303(3) (\u03c9) \u2243\n\nN \u03b3d + N \u03b3n (3)\n\u03c7\n(\u03c9).\n\u03b3d + N \u03b3n \u03b3d \u21920\n\n(30)\n\n\f4\n\n| \u03c7(3)(\u03c9) | (unit: \u03b3r-3)\n\n0.3\n0.25\n0.2\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n\u03c9\u2212\u03a9 (unit: \u03b3r)\nFIG. 1: Comparison of |\u03c7(3) | and its approximate value |\u03c7\u0303(3) |, when N = 5.

Transition to the enhanced value takes place at t \u223c N/(2\u03b3d ).\n\nIn Fig. 1, the approximate susceptibility \u03c7\u0303(3) is compared with the rigorous susceptibility \u03c7(3) . The figure demonstrates\nthat \u03c7\u0303(3) serves as a good approximation of \u03c7(3) .\nNow we discuss the implications of Eq. (30). As far as the linear optical response is questioned, Eq. (25) indicates\nthat the roles of dephasing (\u03b3d ) and nonradiative dissipation (\u03b3n ) are equivalent in determining the linear optical\nresponse. In contrast, when one questions the nonlinear optical response, the roles of two damping mechanisms are\nno more equivalent: The prefactor of the RHS of Eq. (30) indicates that magnitude of \u03c7(3) is sensitive to the ratio\n\u03b3d /\u03b3n , even if both \u03b3d and \u03b3n are much smaller than \u03b3r . When \u03b3d \u226a \u03b3n , \u03c7(3) is essentially independent of the system\nsize N . Contrarily, when \u03b3d \u226b \u03b3n , \u03c7(3) suffers the size-enhancement effect. This observation demonstrates that it is\nindispensable for quantitative evaluation of nonlinear susceptibility to discriminate two damping mechanisms and to\ntreat them non-phenomenologically.\nOne might feel uneasy about the fact that \u03c7(3) is indefinite at \u03b3d = \u03b3n = 0. In order to resolve this problem, we\ninvestigate the transient optical response by considering a situation where monochromatic field, E(t) = Ee\u2212i\u03c9t , is\nswitched on at t = 0. By inspecting Eqs. (14) and (15), we can find that \u03c7(3) has two relaxation rates, N \u03b3r (= \u03c41\u22121 )\nand 2\u03b3d /N + 2\u03b3n (= \u03c42\u22121 ), before attaining to its stationary value. The temporal behavior of |\u03c7(3) | is numerically\n\n\f5\npursued in Fig. 2. The figure clarifies that \u03c7(3) first relaxes to the unenhanced value within a short time (t <\n\u223c \u03c41 ), and\nthe size-enhancement effect emerges gradually in the later stage (t \u223c \u03c42 ). When \u03b3d = \u03b3n = 0 (solid line in Fig. 2),\n(3)\nthe size-enhancement does not take place, and \u03c7(3) = \u03c7\u03b3d \u21920 forever. More generally, when one is concerned with a\n>\ntransient behavior (t <\n\u223c \u03c42 ), the size-enhancement effect is not expected; it is expected only after a long time, t \u223c \u03c42 .\n(3)\nFinally, we comment on the relevance to previous studies. Mathematically, \u03c7 should be evaluated by the stationary solutions of equations of motion for hsi i, hs\u2020i sj i, etc [5]. Because these quantities generally have dependence on\nthe site index i, it is usually difficult to obtain analytic expression of \u03c7(3) . (By taking the eigenstates of the system\nHamiltonian H0 as the basis, one may diagonalize the unitary part of Eq. (1). However, the basis generally does\nnot diagonalize the damping part of Eq. (1) simultaneously [4]. The conventional expansion for \u03c7(3) [11] is obtained\nby approximately neglecting the off-diagonal part.) In the model of our study, an analytic form of \u03c7(3) is obtained\nwithout any approximation by virtue of symmetry of the system, and it is revealed that tiny difference in the damping\nrates in Eqs. (14) and (15) may result in drastically different optical response, as observed in Fig. 2. A novel prediction\nin the present study is that the size-enhancement may take place, even when there is no transfer of excitations among\nthe atoms.\nIn summary, we have analyzed the third-order nonlinear susceptibility of superradiant atoms, which undergoes\nthree different damping mechanisms: radiative dissipation (\u03b3r ), dephasing (\u03b3d ), and nonradiative dissipation (\u03b3n ).\nThe analysis is based on the superradiant master equation supplemented with effects of dephasing and nonradiative\ndissipation [Eqs.(1)-(6)]. The linear susceptibility \u03c7(1) and the third-order susceptibility \u03c7(3) per one atom are given\nby Eqs. (25) and (26), and \u03c7(3) is well approximated by Eq. (30). Whereas the roles of \u03b3d and \u03b3n are equivalent\nin \u03c7(1) [see Eq. (25)], they are no more equivalent in \u03c7(3) [see Eq. (30)]: \u03c7(3) depends on the ratio \u03b3d /\u03b3n . When\n\u03b3d \u226a \u03b3n , \u03c7(3) is essentially that of a single atom. Contrarily, when \u03b3d \u226b \u03b3n , \u03c7(3) suffers the size-enhancement effect\nand becomes proportional to the system size N . These observations indicate that, for qualitative evaluation of \u03c7(3) ,\nit is indispensable to distinguish \u03b3d and \u03b3n clearly, and to handle them in a non-phenomenological manner.\nThe authors are grateful to K.
