Exact diagonalization is then used\nto establish signatures of a spontaneous FQH state.\n\nThe Integer Quantum Hall (IQH) effect [1] is a prime\nexample of an electronic state that cannot be classified\nwithin the traditional framework of symmetry breaking,\nbut is instead characterized by a topological invariant [2].\nIt is by now theoretically well established that an external magnetic field is in principle not needed and that\nstates within the same topological class as IQH states\ncan be realized in lattice models, if time-reversal symmetry is broken by other mechanisms, e.g., by complex\nelectron hoppings [3]. Related topologically nontrivial\nQuantum Spin-Hall (QSH) states even occur in systems\nwhere time-reversal symmetry is not broken at all [4\u20138],\nsee Refs. [9, 10] for reviews. At present, many intriguing features intrinsic to topologically non-trivial states\nhave been observed in the absence of magnetic fields,\nsuch as the metallic Dirac cones at the surface of a topological insulator [11, 12], or the QSH effect in quantum\nwells [13, 14].\nFractional Quantum Hall (FQH) states [15] are topological states that can be seen as composed of quasiparticles carrying an exact fraction of the elementary\nelectronic charge [16]. Apart from the fundamental interest in observing a quasi-particle that behaves in many\nways like a fraction of an electron, some FQH states also\nhave properties relevant to fault-tolerant quantum computation [17]. Very recently [18\u201320], it was suggested\nthat lattice-FQH states may similarly arise without a\nmagnetic field, in fractionally filled topologically nontrivial bands.\nIn contrast to the IQH and QSH effects, which can be\nfully understood in terms of non-(or weakly-)interacting\nelectrons, interactions are an essential requirement for\nFQH states, which places demanding restrictions on candidate systems: One needs a topologically nontrivial\nband that must be nearly flat \u2013 similar to the highly\ndegenerate Landau levels \u2013 so that the electron-electron\ninteraction can at the same time be large compared to\nthe band width and small compared to the gap separating it from other bands [18\u201320]. If the requirements\ncan be fulfilled, however, the temperature scale of the\nFQH state is set by the energy scale of the interaction.\n\nThis can allow temperatures considerably higher than\nthe sub-Kelvin range of the conventional FQH effect,\nwhich would be extremely desirable in view of potential\nquantum-computing applications. Moreover, the lattice\nversion of FQH states [21] may have unique and different\nproperties. [22].\nIn most recently proposed model Hamiltonians [18\u2013\n20, 23\u201325], the topological nature of the bands was introduced by hand and model parameters have to be carefully tuned to obtain very flat bands. As potential realizations, \"purpose built\" physical systems in oxide heterostructures [26] or optical lattices [19] were suggested.\nOn the other hand, topologically nontrivial bands can\nin principle emerge spontaneously in interacting electron\nsystems [27, 28], e.g., for charge-ordered systems [29, 30]\nor for electrons coupling to spins in a non-coplanar magnetic order [31, 32]. We demonstrate here that such a scenario indeed arises in a Hubbard model describing electrons with a t2g orbital degree of freedom on a triangular\nlattice: a ground state with topologically nontrivial and\nnearly flat bands is stabilized by onsite Coulomb interactions. Upon doping the flat bands, longer-range Coulomb\nrepulsion induces FQH states.\nt2g orbitals on the triangular lattice.- The building blocks of our system are oxygen octahedra with a\ntransition-metal (TM) ion in the center, the most common building block in the large and versatile material\nclass of TM oxides. Local cubic symmetry due to the\noxygen ions splits the d-orbitals into t2g and eg levels, and it has been shown that orbital degrees of freedom of either kind can substantially reduce the width\nof topologically nontrivial bands [24]. Here, we concentrate on the t2g orbitals illustrated in Fig. 1(a), which\nare further split by a crystal-field due to the overall\nlattice geometry. On a triangular lattice, we find one\na1g and two e0g,\u00b1 states, see Fig. 1(b), with a splitting\nHJT = \u2206JT (neg+ + neg\u2212 \u2212 2na1g )/3 depending on the\nJahn-Teller effect and the lattice [33].

The filling is 2.5 electrons per site, slightly less than\nhalf filling. Parameters used were t = 1, tdd = 0, U/t = 12,\nJ/t = 3, \u2206JT /t = \u22126. The figure of merit M , which is given\nby the ratio of the gap separating the two a1g subbands of\nthe lower Hubbard band and the band width of the highest\nsubband of the lower Hubbard band, is M \u2248 14.\n\nchoose t > 0 [33] as unit of energy, but analogous results\nhold for n > 3, t < 0, and tdd \u2192 \u2212tdd , \u2206JT \u2192 \u2212\u2206JT due\nto particle-hole symmetry.\nIn TM oxides, Coulomb interaction is substantial compared to the kinetic energy of t2g orbitals and spin-orbital\nphysics induced by correlations are known to be rich in\nt2g systems on triangular lattices [34, 36]. We take into\n\naccount the onsite interaction including Coulomb repulsion U (intra-orbital) and U 0 (interorbital) as well as\nHund's-rule coupling J. We employ a mean-field approximation with a decoupling into expectation values\nof densities hni,\u03b1,\u03c3 i = hc\u2020i,\u03b1,\u03c3 ci,\u03b1,\u03c3 i for site i, orbital \u03b1,\nand spin \u03c3 [37, 38]. The spin is thus reduced to its zcomponent mi,\u03b1 = (ni,\u03b1,\u2191 \u2212 ni,\u03b1,\u2193 )/2 and non-collinear\nmagnetic patterns are treated by allowing for a sitedependent spin-quantization axis expressed by angles \u03b8i\nand \u03c6i . The change in quantization axis from site to site\nmanifests itself in a complex Berry phase for the hopping\nterms [39]. Numerical optimization is used to find the\n\u03b8i and \u03c6i giving the magnetic ground state, permitting\narbitrary magnetic orderings with unit cells of up to four\nsites, including all phases considered in Ref. [40]. For\nsimplicity, we present here results for J/U = 1/4 and the\nrelation U 0 = U \u2212 2J between the Kanamori parameters\nwas used, but we have verified that the results presented\nremain robust for other choices. For details see [35].\nFor wide parameter ranges (see below), the ground\nstate is the non-coplanar spin-chiral phase illustrated\nin Fig. 2(a,b). As demonstrated in the context of the\nKondo-lattice [38, 40] and the Hubbard [38, 41] models, this magnetic order leads to topologically nontrivial\nbands, which can also be seen in the one-particle bands\nshown in Fig. 2(c). The chemical potential lies within the\na1g states of the lower Hubbard band, where the electron\nspin is mostly parallel (labelled by \u2191) to the direction\ndefined by the spin-chiral pattern. Dashed and dotted\nlines decorate states living on the top and bottom edges\nof a cylinder, they cross the chiral gap exactly once as\none left- and one right-moving edge mode, indicating the\ndifferent Chern numbers associated with the two bands\ndirectly above and below the chemical potential. Such a\nspontaneous IQH state is already rather exotic and has\nrecently been shown to support fractionalized excitations\nbound to vortices [42].\nFigure 2(c) also indicates that the upper chiral subband has a very small width, \u223c 14 times smaller than\nthe chiral gap. One can quantify the band flatness by\na figure of merit M given by the ratio of the gap to the\nband width. Its dependence on various parameters of the\nHamiltonian is shown in Fig. 3. It peaks at M > 40, but\nthe more striking observation is that it is above 5 or even\n10 for wide ranges of U , \u2206JT and tdd , in contrast to many\nother proposals that require carefully fine-tuned parameters [18\u201320, 23\u201325, 43]. Nearly flat chiral bands are thus\nvery robust in this system and both their topological\ncharacter and their flat dispersion emerge spontaneously\nwith purely onsite interaction and short-range hopping,\nwithout spin-orbit coupling or any explicit breaking of\ntime-reversal symmetry.\nMapping to an effective model.- For large onsite interactions and large crystal field splitting U, J, |\u2206JT | \u001d\nt, tdd , the three-orbital model with fillings between 2 and\n3 electrons per site can be mapped onto the one-band\n\n\f3\n40\n\n1\n\n35\n\n40\n\n30\n\n0\n\n20\n\n-0.5\n\n10\n\n25\n\nM\n\n30\n\ntdd / t\n\n0.5\n\nU=8, \u2206JT=-2\nU=12, \u2206JT=-8\nU=16, \u2206JT=-8\n\n20\n15\n10\n5\n\n-1\n\n(a)\n\n0\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n-\u2206JT / t\n\n0\n-1\n\n(b)\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\ntdd / t\n\nFIG. 3.

J = U/4 and t = 1 were\nused in all cases.\n\nKondo-lattice model (KLM). Low-energy configurations\nminimize onsite interactions and thus contain two or\nthree electrons per site, with parallel spins due to Hund's\nrule. In order to additionally minimize the crystal-field\nenergy, the e0g levels will always be half filled and form\nan effective spin, while any holes will be found in the a1g\nsector. The electrons in the partially filled a1g states can\ndelocalize with an isotropic hopping ta1g = (2t + tdd )/3,\nhowever, their spin must remain parallel to the local e0g\nspin. In the low-energy limit, each site can thus be described as a spin coupled to a charge degree of freedom\nand we arrive at the situation described by the KLM in\nthe limit of strong Hund's rule coupling. Our numeric\nmean-field results corroborate this picture, see Fig. 2(c),\nwhere the e0g levels are found far below the chemical potential. The KLM supports spin-chiral phases on many\nfrustrated lattices like the triangular [38, 40, 44, 45], pyrochlore [46], and face-centered cubic [47] lattices.\nIn addition to processes within the low-energy Hilbert\nspace, virtual excitations involving high-energy states\ncan be taken into account in second-order perturbation\ntheory. This leads to (i) effective longer-range hopping\nof the a1g electrons and (ii) an effective antiferromagnetic superexchange between the e0g spins. The latter\nstabilizes the spin-chiral pattern [45] and is due to excitations into the upper Hubbard/Kondo band. When\nit is suppressed for U & 24|t|, the ground state consequently becomes FM, as in the KLM with a large Kondo\ngap [40, 44]. Nevertheless, the exotic spin-chiral state is\nremarkably stable in the present t2g system considering\nits sensitivity to Hund's coupling in the KLM [40].\nThe effective longer-range hopping of a1g elec-\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3\n\nFIG. 4.

The filling of the flat band is 2/3.\n\ntrons involves processes via excitations into the upper\nKondo/Hubbard band (\u221d 1/J and \u221d 1/U ) as well as virtual excitations of e0g electrons into a1g states (\u221d 1/\u2206JT ),\nfor details see 35. Second-neighbor hopping \u221d 1/J does\nnot significantly modify the low-energy bands and drops\nout completely in the limit of a large Mott/Hubbard gap,\nbut third-neighbor hopping t3 is crucial in cancelling the\ndispersion coming from NN hopping t1 for one of the\nbands [35]. The simplest description of the effective lowenergy bands around the Fermi level is thus\nX\nX\nHeff (k) = 2t1\n\u03c3 j cos kaj + 2t3\n\u03c3 0 cos 2kaj , (1)\nj\n\nj\n\nwhere aj (j = 1, 2, 3) denote the unit vectors on the triangular lattice. Pauli matrices \u03c3 j and unit matrix \u03c3 0\nrefer to the two sites of the electronic unit cell in the chiral phase [38]. Formally, this describes electrons moving\nin a constant (and very strong) magnetic field with a flux\nof \u03c0/2 threading each triangle of the lattice [38].\nFQH groundstates of an effective spinless one-band\nmodel.- WePnow address the impact of NN Coulomb interaction V hi,ji ni nj on the fractionally filled flat band.\nThe spin-chiral state can only be expected to remain stable for densities close to 2.5 electrons per site, i.e., low\ndoping factions \u03bd of the flat band [40]. FQH states corresponding to such low fillings are generally separated from\nthe rest of the spectrum by only a small gap, making their\nanalysis on finite-size clusters difficult [48]. Here, we use\nLanczos exact diagonalization [20, 35, 43, 48] to study\na number of simple filling fractions (1/3, 2/3, 1/5, and\n2/5) available on accessible lattices and consistently find\nV to induce signatures of a FQH state. It is thus plau-\n\n\f4\nsible that the FQH behavior discussed next persists to\nfractional fillings in a low doping range of the spin-chiral\nstate.\nAs an example, we present here the case of 16 electrons on a 4 \u00d7 6-site cluster of the model Eq. (1), a filling that would correspond to 2.6\u0307 in the original threeorbital model. After a particle-hole transformation, it\ncorresponds to 2/3 filling of the nearly flat band. Figure 4(a) shows that with increasing V , three low-energy\nstates split off from the rest of the spectrum. Inserting\na magnetic flux \u03c6y = 2\u03c0 interchanges the three states,\n\u03c6y = 6\u03c0 recovers the original situation, see Fig. 4(b),\nas reported for other systems [20, 24, 43]. The Chern\nnumber C is evaluated by integrating the flux-dependent\nBerry curvature \u03a9n (\u03c6x , \u03c6y ) (obtained by the Kubo formula [35, 49, 50]) over the square 0 \u2264 \u03c6x , \u03c6y < 6\u03c0. For\nV = 0.2|t|, the three low-energy states have Chern numbers within 1% of the expected C = 2/3, a deviation well\nwithin the limits of reported finite-size effects [20].\nConclusions.- The possibility of a spontaneous FQH\neffect without a magnetic field is currently hotly discussed, and various models have been suggested [18\u2013\n20, 23\u201326, 43]. However, an experimental realization appears challenging, as the necessary topological character\nand the flatness of the bands need to be carefully engineered in previous proposals. We have shown here that\nbands with the desired properties emerge spontaneously\nfor wide parameter ranges in strongly correlated t2g orbitals on a triangular lattice, and that these bands support FQH ground states. Both t2g systems and triangular lattices occur in various TM oxides, and signatures of\nthe unconventional integer QH state have been reported\nfor a triangular-lattice palladium-chromium oxide [51].\nThis harbors the prospect that a suitable material can\nbe synthesized in this highly versatile material class. As\nsuch a material is by default strongly correlated, one also\nnaturally expects an inter-site Coulomb repulsion that is\nstrong enough to stabilize spontaneous FQH states in the\nabsence of a magnetic field.\nThis research was supported by DFG (Emmy-Noether\nprogram; SK and MD) and the Interphase Program of the\nDutch Science Foundation NWO/FOM (JV and JvdB).\nThe appendix contains Supplemental Material:\nOne-particle terms of the multi-orbital t2g\nHamiltonian\n\nThe multi-orbital kinetic energy is\nX\n\u2020\nHkin =\nt\u03b1,\u03b2\ni,j ci,\u03b1,\u03c3 cj,\u03b2,\u03c3 + H.c ,\n\nfor NN bonds along the three directions a1 , a2 , a3 as\nillustrated in Fig. 1 of the main text.

In order\nto treat non-collinear spin patterns, one has to allow for\na site-dependent spin-quantization axis given by angles\n\u03b8i and \u03c6i . The change in quantization axis from site to\nsite manifests itself in a complex phase for the hopping\nterms,[39] which is between sites i and j\n\u03b8j\n\u03b8i\n\u03b8j\n\u03b8i\ncos\n+ sin sin e\u2212i\u03c3(\u03c6i \u2212\u03c6j )\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u03b8i\n\u03b8j \u2212i\u03c6j\n\u03b8j\n\u03b8i\n= cos sin e\n\u2212 cos sin e\u2212i\u03c6i\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\n\u03a9\u03c3,\u03c3\nij = cos\n(2)\n\nhi,ji,\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03c3\n\nc\u2020i,\u03b1,\u03c3\n\nneighbor (NN) bonds, \u03b1 and \u03b2 denote the orbital.

In the site-dependent quantization,\n\n\f5\n\nEffective one-band model and exact diagonalization\n\nThe mapping to the effective one-band model is most\neasily carried out in the Kondo-lattice picture, where the\nlocalized spins are assumed to consist of the e0g electrons. Without a magnetic order, the a1g orbital has\nan isotropic hopping ta1g = (2t + tdd )/3, i.e., the same\nalong all three directions on the triangular lattice, but\nin the spin-chiral phase, this hopping is modulated by a\ndirection-dependent Berry phase Eq. (4). The electronic\nunit cell of the spin-chiral pattern has two sites [38], and\nthe Berry phases can then be expressed in terms of Pauli\nmatrices as given in the main text. The absolute value\n\u221a of\nthe NN hopping is renormalized to t1 = (2t + tdd )/3 3.\nCorrections to this simplest approximation can be obtained by second-order perturbation theory, which yields\nlonger-range hopping processes mediated by virtual excitations. We are first going to discuss processes within the\nlower Kondo/Hubbard band, where an electron from the\ne0g levels, which are half filled in the low-energy Hilbert\nspace, is excited into an empty a1g state in the virtual intermediate state, involving an excitation energy \u2206JT . In\na second step, an electron from a different occupied a1g\nstate can take the empty place in the e0g orbital, which\ncorresponds to an effective hopping. There are two possible hopping paths connecting pairs of either nearest or\nnext-nearest neighbor (NNN) sites and it turns out that\nthe corresponding effective hoppings drop out in the spinchiral phase because the Berry phases for the two paths\ninterfere destructively. Third-neighbor sites, on the other\nhand, are only connected by a single path and the com\u2191,\u2191\nbined Berry phase \u03a9\u2191,\u2191\nij \u03a9jk only renormalizes the effective hopping by a factor of 3, because the spins at sites\ni and k are parallel in the spin-chiral phase. One thus\n\n1\n0.5\n\nmean field\nmapping\nt3 only\n\n0\n(\u03c9 - \u03bc) / |t|\n\nspin is not conserved and there are spin-mixing hoppings\n\u2191,\u2193\nwith \u03a9\u2193,\u2191\nij given by the complex conjugate of \u03a9ji .\nWe use numerical optimization routines to find the spin\npattern with the lowest energy among all orderings with\nunit cells of up to four sites, including all patterns considered in Ref. [40] of the main text. In each step, the meanfield energy is calculated self-consistently for a lattice of\n16\u00d716 (four-site unit cell) or 24\u00d716 (three-site unit cell).\n(For selected points in parameter space, we also used\nlarger lattices and did not find a significant difference.)\nIn order to minimize the impact of our approximations\non the symmetries of the orbital degrees of freedom, we\nperform the mean-field decoupling in the {a1g , e0g,+ , e0g,\u2212 }\nbasis, where the symmetry between the half-filled e0g,+\nand the quarter-filled a1g orbitals (for the fillings discussed here) is already broken by the crystal field. We\nverified that decoupling directly in the {xy, xz, yz} basis,\nwhere all three orbitals have the same electronic density,\nleads to qualitatively identical and quantitatively very\nsimilar results.\n\n-0.5\n-1\n-1.5\n-2\nK\n\nM\n\n\u0393\n\nK\n\nk\n\nFIG. 5. (Color online) Comparison of the low-energy bands\nobtained in mean field theory for the spin-chiral state to those\nobtained in the strong-coupling Kondo-lattice model, including effective hoppings in second-order perturbation theory.\nParameters in mean field are U/t = 12, J/t = 3, \u2206JT /t = \u22126,\nand tdd = 0, as in Fig. 2 of the main text. The different\ndispersions in the upper band are due to the fact that the\nperturbation theory assumes that the second-order\u2013hopping\npath is always available. As the a1g level is partly filled, some\nof these paths are blocked by the Pauli principle, this effect\nis included correctly in mean field. Taking this into account\nphenomenologically by reducing t3 by 20% improves the fit.\nThis was done for the curve referred to as \"t3 only\", where\nonly nearest and third-neighbor hopping were included, while\nsecond-neighbor processes were dropped.\n\nobtains an effective hopping t3 = \u22122(t \u2212 tdd )2 /(27\u2206JT ),\nwhich is the only second-order correction for the limit of\ninfinite Hund's rule. In this limit, t3 flattens the lower\nof the subbands for the fillings discussed here [24].\nIn the more realistic case of strong but finite Hund's\nrule coupling, there are additional processes where the\nvirtual excitation involves an electron in the upper Hubbard/Kondo band. The corresponding excitation energies then contain Hund's coupling J and the effective hoppings from site i to k involve the Berry phases\n\u2193,\u2191\n\u03a9\u2191,\u2193\nij \u03a9jk , see Eq. (4). For the parameters of Fig. 2 of the\nmain text, the chiral bands around the Fermi level are\ncompared to this second-order treatment in Fig. 5. NNN\nhopping does here not drop out, and NN hopping is also\nslightly renormalized, however, both these processes have\nonly a small impact on the low-energy bands. Again, we\nfind third-neighbor hopping t3 to flatten the dispersion of\none of the bands. Since excitations into the upper Hubbard/Kondo band involve electrons rather than holes as\nbefore, the sign of the effective t3 is reversed, and it is\nthe upper chiral subband that is flattened.\nIn order to investigate the FQH groundstate, we used\nLanczos exact diagonalization to study the Hamiltonian\ngiven by the kinetic energy of the effective one-band\nmodel, Eq. (1) of the main text, and NN Coulomb repul-\n\n\f6\nP\nsion V hi,ji ni nj . Hopping parameters t1 = 0.27 and\nt3 = \u22120.058 were used, giving a dispersion similar to\nFig. 5. NN bonds hi, ji are defined on the original triangular lattice and V acts both between the two sites\nwithin one unit cell and between NN sites belonging to\ndifferent unit cells. As mentioned in the main text, the\nspin-chiral state can actually only be expected to be stable for low doping of the flat band [40], which is close to\nhalf filling for the effective one-band model. FQH states\ncorresponding to such small fillings \u03bd tend to have smaller\ngaps than those for large \u03bd, and the low-energy manifold\ngiving the quasi-degenerate FQH states contains more\nstates. On the small clusters that we can study with exact diagonalization, eigenenergies always have spacings\nbetween them, as an illustration see the V = 0 energies\nin Fig. 4(a) of the main text, which would form a continuous band in the thermodynamic limit. It is thus far\nharder to reliably resolve a small gap than a larger one,\nand it is moreover highly desirable that we can study the\nsystem on at least two lattice sizes in order to see a gap.\nThis severely restricts our access to very low dopings. We\nthus study several filling fractions corresponding to \"simple\" FQH states. In all cases where we find a low-energy\nmanifold to separate from the rest of the spectrum, the\nstates of this low-energy manifold shows signatures of\n\nn\n\n\u03a9 (\u03c6x , \u03c6y ) = iLx Ly\n\nFQH behavior, which is thus a very robust feature of the\ndoped flat band.\nInserting a flux (\u03c6x , \u03c6y ) means that electrons gain a\nphase ei\u03c6x (ei\u03c6y ) for going once around the whole lattice\nin x-(y-) direction. This is implemented by changing the\nhopping ti,j from site i = ix a1 + iy a2 to site j = jx a1 +\njy a2 to\nti,j \u2192 ti,j e\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\nx +\u03c6 jy \u2212iy\ni \u03c6x jxL\u2212i\ny Ly\nx\n\n,\n\nleading to a flux-dependent Hamiltonian Heff (\u03c6x , \u03c6y ). In\nthe case of \u03bd = 1/3, we find three low-energy states\nseparated from the remaining spectrum by a gap as in\nthe \u03bd = 2/3 case discussed in the main text, both on a\n6 \u00d7 6 and a 4 \u00d7 6 system. For 6 \u00d7 6 sites, however, all\nthree low-energy states have total momentum (0, 0) for\n(\u03c6x , \u03c6y ) = (0, 0). Due to finite-size effects, the states do\nthen not cross upon flux insertion [48], but avoid crossings. For the smaller 4 \u00d7 6 system, the three low-energy\nstates have different total momenta, and this good quantum number allows us to clearly resolve their crossing\nwhen we insert a flux \u03c6y , even on a finite system.\nThe Chern numbers were evaluated by integrating the\nBerry curvature \u03a9n (\u03c6x , \u03c6y ) over the square 0 \u2264 \u03c6x , \u03c6y <\n6\u03c0. \u03a9n (\u03c6x , \u03c6y ) was obtained by the Kubo formula [49,\n50]\n\n(\u03c6x ,\u03c6y ) 0\n\u2202H (\u03c6 ,\u03c6 )\n\u2202H (\u03c6 ,\u03c6 )\n\u2202H (\u03c6 ,\u03c6 )\nX hn| \u2202Heff\u2202\u03c6\n|n ihn0 | eff\u2202\u03c6yx y |ni \u2212 hn| eff\u2202\u03c6yx y |n0 ihn0 | eff\u2202\u03c6xx y |ni\nx\nn0 6=n\n\nwhere n0 and n label eigenstates with energies \u000fn0 /n and\n\u2202Heff (\u03c6x , \u03c6y )/\u2202\u03c6x/y are current operators.\n\n[1] K. v.
