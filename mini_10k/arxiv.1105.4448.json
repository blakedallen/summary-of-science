Introduction\nIn addition of being of self-interest, Gaussian quadrature formulas for onedimensional integrals are particularly important because among all other quadrature formulas with same number of nodes, they have maximum precision. Indeed,\nwhen supported on p nodes, they are exact for all polynomials of degree at most\n2p \u2212 1. Moreover, the nodes are exactly the zeros of the orthogonal polynomial of\ndegree p and existence is guaranteed whenever the moment matrix of the associated\nlinear functional is positive definite.\nWhen its multi-dimensional analogue exists (then called Gaussian cubature formula), it shares those two important properties of support and precision. That is,\nthe nodes of a cubature formula of degree (or precision) 2p \u2212 1 are the common\nzeros of all orthonormal polynomials of degree p. However, and in contrast to the\none-dimensional case, its existence is not guaranteed even if the moment matrix of\nits associated linear functional is positive definite.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the only necessary and sufficient condition available is [4, Theorem 3.7.4] due to Mysovskikh, which states that an n-dimensional\nGaussian cubature formula of degree 2m \u2212 1 exists if and\n\u0001 only if the orhonormal\npolynomials of degree m have exactly sm\u22121 := n+m\u22121\ncommon zeros. So this\nn\ncondition requires computing those zeros, or, equivalently, all joint eigenvalues of n\nassociated Jacobi matrices; see e.g. [4, Theorem 3.6.2]. Equivalently,\nthis amounts\n\u0001\nto check whether some n multiplication matrices of size n+m\u22122\ncommute\npairwise;\nm\u22121\nsee [4, Theorem 3.6.5].\nOn the other hand, in Cools et al. [1] one may find several lower bounds on the\nnumber of nodes required for a given specific precision; see e.g. [1, Theorem 9, 10,\n11,12, 13]. For more details on orthogonal polynomials and cubature formulas, the\ninterested reader is referred to e.g. the excellent book of Dunkl and Xu [4] and the\nsurvey by Cools et al.

This paper is concerned with existence of Gaussian cubature\nformulas associated with a Borel measure \u03bc on Rn , with all moments finite. Our\ncontribution is to provide a necessary and sufficient condition for existence, different\nin spirit from (and complementary to) Mysovskikh's theorem which requires solving\npolynomial equations, or, equivalently, computing all joint eigenvalues of n Jacobi\nmatrices. Namely, we prove that a Gaussian cubature formula or precision 2m \u2212 1\nexists if and only if a certain overdetermined linear system has a solution. The\ncoefficient matrix of this linear system comes from expressing the product P\u03b1 P\u03b2 of\nany two orthonormal polynomials P\u03b1 , P\u03b2 of degree m, in the basis of orthonormal\npolynomials (P\u03b8 ), of degree at most 2m. In fact, in this expansion, only the constant\ncoefficient and the coefficients of the degree-2m orthonormal polynomials matter.\nThis linear system is always overdetermined and the larger n for fixed m (resp. the\nlarger m for fixed n) the worse it gets. This shows that existence of a Gaussian\ncubature formula imposes severe restrictions on the associated linear functional.\nFinally, we also provide an interpretation of the necessary and sufficient condition, namely that there exists a polynomial Q, which is a linear combination of\northonormal polynomials of degree 2m, and such that\nZ\nZ\nP\u03b1 (x)P\u03b2 (x) d\u03bc(x) =\nP\u03b1 (x)P\u03b2 (x) Q(x) d\u03bc(x),\nfor all pairs (P\u03b1 , P\u03b2 ) of orthonormal polynomials of degree m..\n2. Notation, definitions and preliminaries\nLet x = (x1 , . . . , xn ) and let R[x] be the ring of real polynomials in the variables\nx and R[x]d its subset of\n\u0001 polynomials of degree at most d, which is a vector space\nof dimension sd := n+d\nd . The number of monomials of degree exactly d is denoted\n\u0001\nn+d\u22121\nby rd :=\n. A polynomial f \u2208 R[x]d can be identified with its vector of\nd\ncoefficients (f\u03b1 ) =: f \u2208 Rsd , in the canonical basis (x\u03b1 ), \u03b1 \u2208 Nn . For any real\nsymmetric matrix A, the notation A \u0017 0 (resp. A \u227b 0) stands for A is positive\nsemidefinite (resp. positive definite).\nLet us define the graded lexicographic order (Glex) \u03b1 \u2264gl \u03b2 on Nn , which first\ncreates a partial order by |\u03b1| \u2264 |\u03b2|, and then refines this to a total order by breaking\nties when |\u03b1| = |\u03b2| as would a dictionary with x1 = a, x2 = b, etc. For instance\nwith n = 2, the ordering reads 1, x1 , x2 , x21 , x1 x2 , x22 , . . ..\nFor every integer m \u2208 N, let xm \u2208 R[x]rm be the column vector of all monomials\nof degree m, with the <gl ordering. For instance, with n = 2 and k = 3, x3 \u2208 R[x]4\nand x3 reads\nx3 = (x31 , x21 x2 , x1 x22 , x32 )T .\nWith any sequence y = (y\u03b1 ), \u03b1 \u2208 Nn , one may associate a linear function\nLy : R[x] \u2192 R by\nX\nX\n(2.1)\nf (=\nf\u03b1 x\u03b1 ) 7\u2192 Ly (f ) =\nf\u03b1 y\u03b1 ,\nf \u2208 R[x].\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\nBy a slight abuse of notation, and for any v \u2208 R[x]p denote by Ly (v) the vector\n(Ly (vj )), j \u2264 p. Similarly, for any matrix V \u2208 R[x]p\u00d7r denote by Ly (V) the\nmatrix (Ly (Vij )), i \u2264 p, j \u2264 r. If \u03bc is a finite and positive Borel measure with\n\n\fEXISTENCE OF GAUSSIAN CUBATURE FORMULAS\n\n3\n\nfinite moments y = (y\u03b1 ), \u03b1 \u2208 Nn , then\nZ\nZ\nX\nX\n\u03b1\n(2.2)\nLy (f ) =\nf\u03b1 y\u03b1 =\nf\u03b1 x d\u03bc(x) =\nf d\u03bc,\n\u03b1\u2208Nn\n\n\u03b1\u2208Nn\n\nand \u03bc is called a representing measure for y.\nMoment matrix. The moment matrix Md (y) associated with a sequence y =\n(y\u03b1 ), is the real symmetric matrix with rows and columns indexed by Nnd , and\nwhose entry (\u03b1, \u03b2) is just Ly (x\u03b1+\u03b2 ) (= y\u03b1+\u03b2 ), for every \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 Nnd . Alternatively,\nMd (y) = Ly ((1, x, . . . , xd )T (1, x, . . . , xd )). Of course, if y has a representing measure \u03bc, then Md (y) \u0017 0 for all d \u2208 N, because\nZ\nhf , Md (y)f i = Ly (f 2 ) =\nf 2 d\u03bc \u2265 0,\n\u2200 f \u2208 Rsd .\nHowever, the converse is not true in general, i.e., Md (y) \u0017 0 for all d, does not\nimply that y has representing measure.\n2.1. Orthonormal polynomials. Most of the material of this section is taken\nfrom Helton et al. [5]. Given \u03bc and y = (y\u03b1 ), \u03b1 \u2208 Nn2d , as in (2.2), assume that\nMd (y) \u227b 0 for every d. Then one may define the scalar product h*, *iy on R[x]d :\nZ\nhf, giy := hf , Md (y)gi =\nf g d\u03bc,\n\u2200 f, g \u2208 R[x]d .\nWith d \u2208 N fixed, one may also associate a unique family of polynomials (P\u03b1 ) \u2282\nR[x]d , \u03b1 \u2208 Nnd , orthonormal with respect to \u03bc, as follows:\n\uf8f1\nP\u03b1 \u2208 lin.span {x\u03b2 : \u03b2 \u2264gl \u03b1}\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nhP\u03b1 , P\u03b2 iy = \u03b4\u03b1=\u03b2 , \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 Nnd\n(2.3)\n\uf8f4 hP\u03b1 , x\u03b2 iy = 0 if \u03b2 <gl \u03b1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nhP\u03b1 , x\u03b1 iy > 0, \u03b1 \u2208 Nnd ,\n\nwhere \u03b4\u03b1=\u03b2 denotes the usual Kronecker symbol. Existence and uniqueness of such\na family is guaranteed by the Gram-Schmidt orhonormalization process following\nthe 'Glex\" order of monomials, and by positivity of the moment matrix Md (y).\nSee e.g. [4, Theorem 3.1.11, p. 68].\nComputation. Computing the family of orthonormal polynomials is relatively\neasy once the moment matrix Md (y) is available. Suppose that one wants to\ncompute p\u03c3 for some \u03c3 \u2208 Nnd .\nBuild up the submatrix M\u03c3d (y) obtained from Md (y) by keeping only those\ncolumns indexed by \u03b2 \u2264gl \u03c3 and with rows indexed by \u03b1 <gl \u03c3. Hence M\u03c3d (y)\nhas one row less than columns. Complete M\u03c3d (y) with an additional last row\ndescribed by M\u03c3d (y)[\u03c3, \u03b2] = x\u03b2 , \u03b2 \u2264gl \u03c3. Then, up to a normalizing constant,\nP\u03c3 = det M\u03c3d (y). For instance with n = 2, d = 2 and \u03c3 = (11), one has\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\ny00 y10 y01 y20 y11\n\uf8ef y10 y20 y11 y30 y21 \uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n(2.4)\nx 7\u2192 P(11) (x) = M det \uf8ef\n\uf8ef y01 y11 y02 y21 y12 \uf8fa .\n\uf8f0 y20 y30 y21 y40 y31 \uf8fb\n1\nx1 x2 x21 x1 x2\nR 2\nwhere the constant M is chosen so that P(11)\nd\u03bc = 1; eee e.g. [4, 5].\n\n\f4\n\nJEAN B. LASSERRE\n\n3. Gaussian cubature formula\nGiven a finite Borel measure \u03bc on K \u2282 Rn with all moments finite, points\nx(i) \u2208 Rn , and weights \u03b3i \u2208 R, i = 1, . . . s, the linear functional I : L1 (\u03bc) \u2192 R,\n(3.1)\n\nf 7\u2192 I(f ) :=\n\ns\nX\n\n\u03b3i f (x(i)),\n\nf \u2208 F,\n\ni=1\n\nR\nis called a cubature formula of degree (or precision) p, if I(f ) = K f d\u03bc for all\nf \u2208 R[x]p ; the points\n(x(i)) are called the nodes. In other words, the approximation\nR\nof the integral f d\u03bc by (3.1) is exact for all polynomials of degree at most p.\nCubature formulas are the multivariate analogues of quadrature formulas in the\none dimensional case. By Tchakaloff's theorem, given \u03bc on K with finite moments,\nand d \u2208 N, there exists a measure \u03bd finitely supported on at most rd points of K,\nand whose moments up to order at least d coincide with those of \u03bc; see e.g. Putinar\n[8]. And so there exists a cubature formula of degree d. In the one-dimensional\ncase, the celebrated Gaussian quadrature formula based on d points (called nodes)\nof K has precision 2d \u2212 1 and positive weights. It exists as soon as the moment\nmatrix of order d is positive definite, and all the nodes are zeros of the orthonormal\npolynomial of degree d. It is an important quadrature because among all quadrature\nformulas with same number of nodes, it is the one with maximum precision,\nWhen its multivariate analogue exists (then called a Gaussian cubature), the\nnodes are now the common zeros of all orthonormal polynomials of degree d, the\nprecision is also 2d \u2212 1, and the weights are also positive. But its existence is\nnot guaranteed even if all moment matrices are positive definite. For a detailed\naccount on cubatures and orhogonal polynomials, the interested reader is referred\nto the very nice book of Dunkl and Xu [4], as well as the survey or Cools et al. [1].\n3.1. Existence of Gaussian cubature. Mysovskikh's theorem [4, Theorem 3.7.4]\nstates that a Gaussian cubature of degree\nm exists if and only if the orthonormal\n\u0001\npolynomials Pm have exactly n+m\u22121\ncommon zeros. And so checking existence\nn\nreduces to computing all joint eigenvalues of n so-called Jacobi matrices of size\nsm\u22121 described in e.g. [4, p. 114]. We here provide an alternative criterion for\nexistence which reduces to check whether a certain overdetermined linear system\nhas a solution.\nLet \u03bc be a finite Borel measure with support supp \u03bc = K \u2282 Rn , and with all\nmoments y = (y\u03b1 ), \u03b1 \u2208 Nn , finite. We will adopt the same notation in [4]. Let (P\u03b1 ),\n\u03b1 \u2208 Nn , be a system of orthonormal polynomials with respect to \u03bc, and with each\nm \u2208 N, let Pm = [P|\u03b1|=m ] \u2208 R[x]rm be the (column) vector (P\u03b1(m1 ) , . . . , P\u03b1(mrm ) )T ,\nwhere (\u03b1(mi ) ) \u2282 Nnm are all monomials of degree m, with \u03b1(m1 ) <gl \u03b1(m2 ) * * * <gl\n\u03b1(mrm ) .

But by [4,\nCorollary 3.6.4], Pm has at most sm\u22121 common zeros. Therefore, Pm has exactly\nsm\u22121 common zeros and \u03c8 is supported on all common zeros of Pm . By [4, Theorem\n3.7.4], \u03bc admits a Gaussian cubature formula of degree 2m\u22121. Indeed, since z\u03b1 = y\u03b1\nfor all |\u03b1| \u2264 2m \u2212 1, then for every f \u2208 R[x]2m\u22121 ,\nZ\n\nZ\n\nf (x) d\u03bc(x) = Ly (f ) = Lz (f ) =\n\nsm\u22121\n\nf d\u03c8 =\n\nX\n\n\u03b3k f (x(k)),\n\nk=1\n\nwith \u03b3k > 0 for every k.\n\n\u0003\n\nBy [1, Theorem 7], we also know that the x(k)'s belong to the interior of the\nconvex hull conv K of K.\nObserve that existence of a solution u \u2208 Rr2m for the linear system (3.3) imposes\ndrastic conditions on the linear functional Ly because (3.3) is always overdetermined. Moreover, for fixed m (resp. for fixed n) the larger n (resp. the larger m)\nthe worse it gets. This is because tm (= rm (rm + 1)/2) increases faster than r2m .\nInterpretation. We next provide an explicit expression of the vector A(0,2m) as\nwell as the matrix A(2m,2m) , which permits to obtain an interpretation of the\ncondition (3.3).\nFor \u03b3, \u03b2 \u2208 Nm , applying the linear functional Ly to both sides of (3.2) yields\n(3.6)\n\n(0,2m)\n\n\u03b4\u03b3=\u03b2 = Ly (P\u03b3 P\u03b2 ) = A\u03b3\u03b2\n\n,\n\n\u2200|\u03b3| = |\u03b2| = m.\n\nbecause Ly (Pk ) = 0 for all k. This provides an explicit expression of the vector\nA(0,2m) . Similarly, multiplying both sides of (3.2) by P\u03ba with |\u03ba| = 2m, and\napplying again Ly , yields\nX\n(2m,2m)\n(2m,2m)\nA\u03b3\u03b2\n(\u03b1) Ly (P\u03b1 P\u03ba ) = A\u03b3\u03b2\n(\u03ba),\n(3.7)\nLy (P\u03b3 P\u03b2 P\u03ba ) =\n|\u03b1|=2m\n\nbecause Ly (P\u03b1 P\u03ba ) = \u03b4\u03b1=\u03ba . This provides an explicit expression for all the entries\nof the matrix A(2m,2m) . And we obtain:\nCorollary 3.2.
