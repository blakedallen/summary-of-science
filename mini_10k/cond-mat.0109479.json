The\nmodel is studied for a wide range of parameters including weak and strong\ninteractions as well as the symmetric and unsymmetric case. In all examined\ncases the < d+ f >-expectation value vanishes for vanishing hybridization V ,\nindicating that the spinless Falicov-Kimball model does not allow for a ferroelectric ground state with a spontaneous polarization.\n\nPACS nrs.: 71.27.+a, 71.28.+d, 71.30.+h\n\n1\n\n\fThe Falicov-Kimball model (FKM) has become, since its introduction [1] in 1969,\none of the most popular examples of a system of interacting electrons with shortrange interactions. It has been used in the literature to study a great variety of\nmany-body effects in metals, of which metal-insulator transitions, mixed-valence\nphenomena, and charge-density waves are the most common examples [2]. In the\nlast few years the FKM is extensively studied in connection with the exciting idea\nof electronic ferroelectricity [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. It is generally supposed that the ferroelectricity in mixed-valent compounds is of purely electronic origin, i.e., it results\nfrom an electronic phase transition, in contrast to the conventional displacive ferroelectricity due to a lattice distortion. Since the FKM is probably the simplest\nmodel of electronic phase transitions in rare-earth and transition-metal compounds\nit was natural to start to examine possibilities of electronic ferroelectricity just on\nthis model. An important milestone on this way was the recent work by Portengen at\nal. [3, 4]. They studied the FKM with a k-dependent hybridization in Hartree-Fock\napproximation and found, in particular, that the Coulomb interaction U between the\nitinerant d-electrons and the localized f -electrons gives rise a non-vanishing excitonic\n< d+ f >-expectation value even in the limit of vanishing hybridization V \u2192 0. As\nan applied (optical) electrical field provides for excitations between d- and f-states\nand thus for a polarization expectation value Pdf =< d+\ni fi >, the finding of a spontaneous Pdf (without hybridization or electric field) has been interpreted as evidence\nfor electronic ferroelectricity. This result motivated further theoretical studies of the\nmodel. Analytical calculations within well controlled approximation (for U small)\nperformed by Czycholl [5] in infinite dimensions do not confirm the existence of electronic ferroelectricity. In contrast to results obtained by Portengen et al. [3, 4] he\nfound that the FKM in the symmetric case (Ef = 0, nf = nd = 0.5) does not allow\nfor a ferroelectric ground state with a spontaneous polarization, i.e., there is no nonvanishing < d+ f >-expectation value in the limit of vanishing hybridization. The\n2\n\n\fsame conclusion has been also obtained independently by extrapolation of smallcluster exact-diagonalization calculations in the one dimension for both intermediate\nand strong interactions [6]. In these regions the finite-size effects are negligible and\nthus the results can be satisfactory extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit. Very\nrecently Zlati\u0107 et. al. [7] analysed the static susceptibility for spontaneous polarization in the ordinary FKM (V = 0) using the exact solution of the model in infinite\ndimensions. They found, in particular, that the spontaneous hybridization susceptibility diverges at T \u2192 0 for U = 0 and probably for nonzero U too, indicating a\npossibility of a nonzero < d+ f >-expectation value in the ground state.\nIn order to shed some light on these controversial results we performe an exhaustive study of the model for a wide range of model parameters. While in our previous\npaper the possibilities for the electronic ferroelectricity have been studied only in the\nsymmetric case and intermediate and strong interactions [6] we extend here calculations also to the unsymmetric case and small interactions. To suppress the finite-size\neffects in the weak-coupling limit one has to consider much larger clusters than can\nbe treat numerically within the exact-diagonalization calculations (L \u223c 12). For\nthis reason we have decided to use in numerical computations the density matrix\nrenormalization group (DMRG) method [8] that allows to treat several times larger\nclusters and still to keep the high accuracy of computations.\nAs mentioned above the FKM is based on the coexistence of two different types\nof electronic states in a given material: localized, highly correlated ionic-like states\nand extended, uncorrelated, Bloch-like states. It is accepted that insulator-metal\ntransitions result from a change in the occupation numbers of these electronic states,\nwhich remain themselves basically unchanged in their character. Taking into account only the intra-atomic Coulomb interaction between the two types of states,\nthe Hamiltonian of the spinless FKM with hybridization can be written as the sum\nof four terms:\n3\n\n\fH=\n\nX\n\ntij d+\ni dj + U\n\nX\n\nfi+ fi d+\ni di + Ef\n\nfi+ fi + V\n\nX\n\ni\n\ni\n\nij\n\nX\n\nd+\ni fi + h.c.,\n\n(1)\n\ni\n\nwhere fi+ , fi are the creation and annihilation operators for an electron in the localized state at lattice site i with binding energy Ef and d+\ni , di are the creation and\nannihilation operators of the itinerant spinless electrons in the d-band Wannier state\nat site i.\nThe first term of (1) is the kinetic energy corresponding to quantum-mechanical\nhopping of the itinerant d electrons between sites i and j. These intersite hopping\ntransitions are described by the matrix elements tij , which are \u2212t if i and j are the\nnearest neighbors and zero otherwise (in the following all parameters are measured\nin units of t). The second term represents the on-site Coulomb interaction between\nthe d-band electrons with density nd =\ndensity nf =\n\n1\nL\n\nP\n\ni\n\n1\nL\n\nP\n\ni\n\nd+\ni di and the localized f electrons with\n\nfi+ fi , where L is the number of lattice sites. The third term stands\n\nfor the localized f electrons whose sharp energy level is Ef . The last term represents\nthe hybridization between the itinerant and localized states.\nIn order to test the convergence of the DMRG method for the FKM with hybridization let us first consider the case U = 0 (Ef = 0). In this case the Hamiltonian\n(1) can be diagonalized exactly yielding the following expressions for the ground-state\nenergy and the Pdf expectation value\n\nEg =\n\n1 X\n(\u01ebk \u2212 (\u01eb2k + 4V 2 )1/2 ),\n2L k\n\nPdf = \u2212\nwhere \u01ebk =\n\n1\nL\n\nP\n\nik(Ri \u2212Rj )\n.\nij tij e\n\n1\nV X\n,\nL k (\u01eb2k + 4V 2 )1/2\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nThese expressions are valid for arbitrary L and thus\n\nthey can be used directly for comparison with DMRG results obtained on finite\nclusters. Such a comparison shows that the DMRG results reproduce the exact\n4\n\n\fresults with high accuracy (\u223c 10\u22125 ) even if a relatively small number of states is\nkept (m = 128), thereby the clusters up to 100 sites become accessible for numerical\nstudies. This is illustrated in Fig. 1a where the difference \u2206E = Egexact \u2212 EgDM RG\nis plotted as a function of L for m = 128 and two values of V . It is seen that the\ndifference \u2206E is smaller than 10\u22125 for all clusters of size L \u2264 100. One can expect\nthat the finite-size effects will be considerably reduced for such cluster sizes and thus\nthe DMRG results could be satisfactory extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit\nalso for weak interactions. Numerical results obtained for the ground-state energy\nEg (Fig. 1b) and the Pdf expectation value (Fig. 2a) fully confirm this conjecture.\nIt is seen that the finite-size effects are small for both Eg and Pdf and so the most\nimportant feature, and namely the behavior of Pdf for V \u2192 0 can be reliably deduced\nfrom these results. In all cases the < d+ f >-expectation value vanishes in the limit\nV \u2192 0, so there is no spontaneous polarization in the one-dimensional spinless FKM\nwith nearest-neighbor hopping [9] for U = 0. Using the expression (3) one can show\nimmediately that the same behavior holds in any dimension. In Fig. 2b we have\ndisplayed numerical results for Pdf obtained in the thermodynamic limit for d = 1, 2\nand d = \u221e (Bethe lattice). In all cases Pdf vanishes continuously for V \u2192 0, which\nseems to contradict recent results obtained by Zlati\u0107 et. al. [7] for the ordinary FKM\n(V = 0) in infinite dimensions. Indeed, a comparison of our d = \u221e results for the\n< d+ f >-expectation value with d = \u221e results obtained by Zlati\u0107 et. al. [7] for the\nspontaneous hybridization susceptibility \u03c7hyb leads to very interesting observation.\nWhile the hybridization susceptibility \u03c7hyb diverges for V = 0, the Pdf expectation\nvalue goes to zero in the limit of vanishing V . This can be shown also analytically\nusing the explicit expression (Eq. 3) for the Pdf expectation value. Replacing the\nsummation in Eq. 3 by integration over the energy and taking the constant density\nof states, for simplicity, one can easily show that the Pdf expectation value (in the\nlimit of vanishing V ) behaves like V lnV . Thus Pdf vanishes at V = 0, although \u03c7hyb\n5\n\n\fdiverges at this point. This shows that one has to be very careful in doing conclusions\nabout the Pdf behavior from the spontaneous hybridization susceptibility.\nThe same behavior of the model we expect also for nonzero U. To verify this we\nperform an exhaustive study of the model for a wide range of the model parameters.\nIn addition to the half-filled band case n = 1 we examine here in detail also the case\nn = 0.5, Ef < 0, where Zlati\u0107 et. al. [7] found a numerical evidence for a spontaneous\npolarization (the divergence of the spontaneous hybridization susceptibility).\nLet us first discuss the DMRG results obtained for Pdf in the half-filled band case\nand small but finite U. This case was not discussed in our previous paper [6] since\nsmall-cluster exact-diagonalization calculations were not able to give reliable answers\ndue to large finite-size effects in this region. As mentioned above within the DMRG\nmethod much large clusters can be treated numerically, thereby the finite-size effects\nare considerably reduced. The weak-coupling numerical results for Pdf are displayed\nin Fig. 3 for U = 0.5 and several values of Ef . Obviously the one-dimensional FKM\ndoes not exhibit a ferroelectric ground state with a spontaneous polarization in the\nweak-coupling limit. For all examined values of Ef the < d+ f >-expectation value\nvanishes for V \u2192 0, and it is demonstrated that this result is independent of L.\nThe same calculations are performed also for n = 0.5 and Ef < 0. Since the\nnumerical results obtained by Zlati\u0107 et. al. [7] show on the possibility of a spontaneous polarization in this region a very detailed analysis of the model is done in\nthis parameter space for both weak and strong interactions. The typical behaviors\nobtained by numerical simulations are presented in Fig. 4. Again there is no spontaneous polarization, neither for weak nor for strong interactions. In all cases Pdf \u2192 0\nfor V \u2192 0. The finite-size effects are small for both weak and strong interactions\nand thus these results can be satisfactory extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit.\nThus we can summarize our results. The numerical studies of the spinless FKM\nby density matrix renormalization group method did not confirm a possibility of\n6\n\n\fa ferroelectric ground state with a spontaneous polarization in this model. In all\nexamined cases (weak and strong interactions, the symmetric and unsymmetric case)\nthe Pdf expectation value vanishes for V \u2192 0, in contrast to what is expected from the\nbehavior of the spontaneous hybridization susceptibility [7]. This fact considerably\nreduces (although does not exclude definitively) the possibility for the existence of a\nferroelectric ground state with a spontaneous polarization in the spinless FKM.\nThis work was supported by the Slovak Grant Agency for Science under grant\nNo. 2/7021/20.\n\n7\n\n\fReferences\n[1] L.M.

(a) Hybridization dependence of the < d+ f >-expectation value calculated\nfor finite clusters (DMRG results) and in the thermodynamic limit (from Eq. 3) for\nU = 0. (b) Hybridization dependence of the < d+ f >-expectation value calculated\nin the thermodynamic limit (from Eq. 3) for d = 1, 2 and d = \u221e.\nFig. 3. Hybridization dependence of the < d+ f >-expectation value calculated\nfor U = 0.5 and several values of Ef (DMRG results) at half-filling (n = 1). To\nreveal the finite-size effects the calculations have been performed for several finite\nclusters.\nFig. 4. Hybridization dependence of the < d+ f >-expectation value calculated for\nU = 0.5 (a) and U = 5 (b) and several values of Ef (DMRG results) at quarter-filling\n(n = 1/2).\n\n9\n\n\f\u22126\n\n4\n\nx 10\n\n\u22120.6\nV=0.05\nV=0.1\n\n3.5\n\n\u22120.7\n\n3\n\n\u22120.8\n\n2.5\n\n\u22120.9\n\n2\n\n\u22121\n\n1.5\n\n\u22121.1\n\n1\n\n\u22121.2\n\n0.5\n\n\u22121.3\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\nL\n\n80\n\nL=12\nL=24\nL=48\nL=\u221e\n\nb)\n\nEg\n\n\u2206E\n\na)\n\n100\n\n\u22121.4\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nHybridization V\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n\f0\n\n0\nL=12\nL=24\nL=48\nL=\u221e\n\na)\n\nb)\n\nd=1\nd=2\nd=\u221e\n\n<d+f>\u2212expectation value\n\n<d+f>\u2212expectation value\n\n\u22120.1\n\n\u22120.2\n\n\u22120.3\n\n\u22120.1\n\n\u22120.4\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nHybridization V\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n\u22120.2\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\nHybridization V\n\n0.1\n\n\f0\n\n<d+f>\u2212expectation value\n\nL=16\nL=24\nL=32\n\nEf=\u22122\n\n\u22120.1\n\nEf=0\n\nEf=\u22120.8\n\n\u22120.2\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\nHybridization V\n\n0.1\n\n\f0\n\n0\n\na)\n\nL=16\nL=24\nL=32\n\nb)\n\nL=16\nL=24\nL=32\n\nEf=0\n\n<d+f>\u2212expectation value\n\n<d+f>\u2212expectation value\n\nEf=0\n\nEf=\u22120.4\n\u22120.1\n\n\u22120.1\n\nEf=\u22120.4\n\nEf=\u22120.8\nEf=\u22120.8\n\n\u22120.2\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\nHybridization V\n\n0.2\n\n\u22120.2\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\nHybridization V\n\n0.2\n\n\f"}
