During the most recent published data\u2013taking run of the ground-based GW detectors five instruments\nwere operational. The three LIGO detectors started their Science Run 5 (S5) in November 2005 [2]. Subsequently,\nthe GEO 600 detector [3] joined the S5 run in January 2006 and the Virgo detector [4] started its Science Run 1\n(VSR1) in May 2007. All five detectors worked in triple\u2013coincidence until the beginning of October 2007. The data\ncollected during the rest of the S5/VSR1 run, referred to as \"S5y2/VSR1\", was the first long\u2013term observation with\nthe worldwide network of interferometric detectors. Towards the end of 2010, the LIGO and Virgo detectors were\ntaken offline and the upgrade to the Advanced detectors began. If the design sensitivities are achieved, Advanced\nLIGO and Virgo will increase the detection range of future searches by as much as a factor of 10 over those reached\nin S5y2/VSR1, so that the monitored volume of the universe will increase by a factor of \u223c 1000. At this level of\nsensitivity, the detection of GW signals from binary mergers should become routine.\nSeismic noise will still limit the sensitivity of the advanced detector network LIGO\u2013Virgo\u2013GEO to frequencies >\n\u223c 10\nHz [5, 6]. Hence, upgraded ground\u2013based advanced detectors will not be very sensitive to signals from coalescing\nbinaries in the \u223c 10M\u2299 \u2212 1000M\u2299 range, which generate GWs predominantly in the 0.1\u201310 Hz frequency band.\nThese events will also be inaccessible to the space-based GW detector LISA, as this instrument will be most sensitive\nto events with total mass >\n\u223c 1000M\u2299, i.e., signals in the 0.1mHz \u2212 0.1Hz band. Studying GW sources in 0.1\u201310 Hz\nfrequency band is needed to address an important, yet elusive, problem in astronomy, that of the existence of black\nholes of intermediate mass (IMBHs). There has been a long standing suspicion that these objects may form in the\ncentres of dense stellar clusters [7\u20139]. Some evidence supporting this possibility has come to light over the last decade,\nmainly from X\u2013ray and optical observations [10]. Detection of these IMBHs, particularly in dense stellar clusters,\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: eah41@ast.cam.ac.uk; Electronic address: jgair@ast.cam.ac.uk\n\n\f2\nmay be important as they would have a direct impact in the dynamical evolution of the host cluster and lead to the\ngeneration of GWs.\nThere are two types of data that suggest the existence of IMBHs: i) ultraluminous X-ray sources have been observed\nin galaxies that are not associated with AGN, but which have fluxes which would imply accretion rates many times\nthe Eddington limit, if the accreting object had a mass M <\n\u223c 20M\u2299 ; ii) the stellar kinematics in the centres of\nseveral globular clusters, e.g., M15 in the Milky Way, and G1 in M31, show evidence for an excess of dark mass in\ntheir centres. There are two distinct channels through which IMBHs might have formed. Firstly, they could form in\nthe early universe through the collapse of massive, low\u2013metallicity \"Population III\" stars. In the cold dark matter\nframework, galaxies formed through a series of mergers between initially low-mass objects that condensed at early\ncosmic times. The black holes seen today similarly grew through a combination of mergers and accretion, from initial\nseeds. In the Pop-III star model, the initial seed black holes are of intermediate mass, 100M\u2299 \u2212 1000M\u2299, but the\ninitial seeds could also have been 'heavy', \u223c 105 M\u2299 . The discovery of IMBHs present at early cosmic times would\nbe a strong discriminator between these alternative models. The second proposed channel for IMBH formation is the\nrunaway collision of stars in the centre of a dense stellar cluster [11, 12]. If IMBHs are found to be common in globular\nclusters, this would be an important probe of the processes taking place in such dense stellar systems. Observations\nin the electromagnetic spectrum will improve in coming years, but it is likely that the first robust mass determination,\nand hence the first convincing proof of the existence of IMBHs, will come from GW observations [10].\nIn order to detect GWs from systems containing IMBHs, we require a detector operating in the 1 \u2212 10Hz frequency\nrange. A design study is currently ongoing within Europe for a third-generation ground-based GW detector, the\nEinstein Telescope (ET) [13, 14], to follow on from the Advanced detectors. The target is a sensitivity ten times\nbetter than that of the Advanced interferometers, and a frequency sensitivity band that stretches down into the\n1 \u2212 10Hz range. The ET will be an outstanding tool to address problems in fundamental physics, cosmology and\nastrophysics. It will have the capability to do the same type of science as the Advanced detectors, but with better\nsensitivity, and to do new science through the detection of sources at lower frequencies. The IMBH sources fall\ninto this second category, and in this paper we will consider GWs generated from intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals\n(IMRIs), which are the mergers of IMBHs with lower mass compact objects, namely neutron stars or stellar\u2013mass\nblack holes.\nFor ET to detect GWs generated during IMRIs, we need accurate waveform models in the intermediate-mass-ratio\nregime, which are not yet available. Source modelling is an ongoing effort that has reached a fairly advanced stage\nfor comparable-mass-ratio and extreme-mass-ratio systems. In the comparable-mass regime post\u2013Newtonian (PN)\ntheory has provided waveform templates for the inspiral phase evolution, while numerical relativity (NR) can now be\nused to model the final few cycles of inspiral and the plunge and merger [15]. At the other extreme we have extreme\u2013\nmass\u2013ratio inspirals (EMRIs) with mass ratios \u223c 10\u22126 \u201310\u22124. In this regime, the smaller object may complete several\nhundred thousand orbits at a velocity that is a significant fraction of the speed of light before crossing the horizon of\nthe central massive black hole. Modelling the gravitational radiation of EMRIs using NR is presently impractical due\nto the excessive computational cost of simulating so many orbits. However, we can model these systems accurately\nusing black hole perturbation theory, treating the mass\u2013ratio as a small expansion parameter [16\u201319]. The sources we\nshall now examine lie somewhere between these two regimes. In paper I of this series [20] we developed two waveform\nmodels that include the inspiral, merger and ringdown phases using the best of what is currently available. In the\nfirst model, valid for CO inspirals into IMBHs of arbitrary spin, we used the transition scheme developed by Ori\n& Thorne [1]. In order to build up confidence in this waveform model, we also used the effective\u2013one\u2013body (EOB)\napproach [21, 22] to construct a different waveform model for non\u2013spinning systems. The two models showed an\nexcellent level of agreement in both the phase and the amplitude. We used these models to compute signal\u2013to\u2013noise\nratios (SNRs) for a selection of IMRI systems. We compared results from the two models for non\u2013spinning systems\nand found that the predictions were consistent to better than ten percent. We used these SNRs to estimate the number\nof events that could be detected by ET and found that this could be as many as hundreds of IMRI coalescences per\nyear up to redshift z \u223c 5, if the systems are predominantly light and with high spin, (i.e., an IMRI with redshifted\nmasses, [10 + 100]M\u2299, and with IMBH spin parameter q = 0.9), or as many as tens of IMRI coalescences at redshift\nz \u223c 0.3, if the systems are predominantly heavy and with low spin ([1.4 + 500]M\u2299, with q = 0) [20]. In this paper,\nwe shall address a complementary problem, namely, to calculate the precision with which an ET network will be able\nto estimate parameters of any IMRI sources that are detected. This is an important problem because an accurate\ndetermination of the masses of a merging binary and a measurement of the luminosity distance at which the merger\nis taking place will be useful for extracting science from the observations. Since the binary systems are typically\nshort\u2013lived, a single ET will not be able to localise a source on the sky, so we will assume the existence of a detector\nnetwork. We will consider several different network configurations in order to assess how this affects the science, which\nwill be useful input for future design decisions.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section II we outline the assumptions we shall adopt for the detector and\ndetector networks, and describe the binary systems to be used in the subsequent analysis. In Section III we present a\n\n\f3\nbrief description of the waveform models, introduced in paper I, that will be used again here to estimate parameter\nestimation accuracies. In Section IV we summarise some basics of signal analysis that will be relevant for our studies\nand briefly describe the noise model we shall use for our studies, \"ET B\" [23]. In Section V we will use our waveform\nmodels, as described in paper I [20], to estimate the parameter errors that would arise due to detector noise, using\nthe Fisher Matrix formalism. We present results for a 3\u2013ET network for 12 sample IMRI systems and use four of\nthese to explore how the results change under alternative configurations of the network. Finally, we summarize our\nwork and discuss the implications of these results in Section VI.\nII.\nA.\n\nASSUMPTIONS\n\nEinstein Telescope Design\n\nWe follow the same assumptions about the ET sensitivity that we made in paper I. The design sensitivity is usually\nquoted for a single right-angle interferometer with 10km arms. In this paper we shall use the \"ET B\" sensitivity\ncurve, as described in [23], which was the most up-to-date sensitivity curve available when this work started. The\ncorresponding amplitude spectrum is plotted in Figure 1.\n-20\n\n10\n\nAdvanced LIGO\nET-B\n\n-21\n\n1/2\n\nSh (f)(Hz\n\n-1/2\n\n)\n\n10\n\n-22\n\n10\n\n-23\n\n10\n\n-24\n\n10\n\n-25\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\nf(Hz)\nFIG. 1: Sensitivity curve for the Einstein Telescope. The Advanced LIGO noise curve is also shown for reference.\n\nIt is expected that ET will operate with an improved sensitivity over advanced detectors in the frequency range\n1\u201310Hz. Assuming a low frequency cut\u2013off of 1Hz might be too optimistic as it is a significant technological challenge\nto push the sensitivity toward lower frequencies. ET may therefore only achieve sensitivity down to \u223c 3Hz or higher.\nGiven this uncertainty, we adopt a conservative approach and use a low frequency cut\u2013off of 5Hz.\nWe take the response of a \"single ET\" to be that of two right-angle interferometers, coplanar and colocated but\noffset from one another by 45\u25e6 . The currently favoured ET design is for a triangular configuration comprising three\n10km detectors with 60\u25e6 opening angles in a single facility, as this has lower infrastructure costs [13, 14]. The response\nof the triangular configuration contains the same information\n\u221a as that of the two right-angle interferometers (assuming\nuncorrelated noise), but its sensitivity is a factor of 3/(2 2) \u2248 1.06 higher. As in paper I, we ignore this factor since\nit is small compared to other uncertainties in the design.\nIMRI signals are short\u2013lived, so to enable extrinsic parameter estimation we need to assume the existence of a\nnetwork of detectors. Our optimistic reference case will be a network of three detectors, each with the sensitivity of\na single ET. We assume the detectors are sited at the geographic locations of Virgo, LIGO Livingston and in Perth\n(Australia). This configuration is highly optimistic, so we shall also explore how parameter estimation accuracies are\nmodified for four additional network configurations, C1-C4. These configurations are, C1: one ET at the geographic\nlocation of Virgo; C2: as configuration C1 plus a right\u2013angle detector at the location of LIGO Livingston; C3: as\nconfiguration C1 plus another ET at the location of LIGO Livingston; and C4: as configuration C2 plus another\nright\u2013angle detector in Perth. We will denote the reference 3-ET network as configuration C5.\n\n\f4\nB.\n\nSample IMRI systems\n\nWe will present parameter estimation errors for the same twelve binary systems that we used in paper I [20]. These\ncorrespond to all possible combinations between four sets of component masses - 1.4M\u2299 + 100M\u2299, 1.4M\u2299 + 500M\u2299,\n10M\u2299 + 100M\u2299, and 10M\u2299 + 500M\u2299 - and three different values for the spin of the central IMBH - q = 0, 0.3, 0.9.\nThe mass and spin distributions of IMBHs are extremely uncertain, so we choose these systems to cover the range\nof possibilities. The small object masses are chosen to represent mergers with black holes (10M\u2299 ) or neutron stars\n(1.4M\u2299 ).\nAs discussed in paper I [20], if IMBHs gain mass through a series of minor mergers with smaller objects, then their\nangular momenta will undergo a damped random walk. Under such an evolution, it is expected that IMBHs in the\nmass range 100M\u2299 \u2212 1000M\u2299 would end up with moderate spin parameters, q \u223c 0.3 [24]. We will regard this as\nthe 'typical' case and will use only that spin value when we explore how the parameter estimation accuracies depend\non the network configuration. For the other spin parameters, we shall only quote results for the optimistic 3 ET\nnetwork and these should be regarded as 'best-case' values for the accuracy with which we may be able to determine\nthe parameters.\nIII.\n\nIMRI WAVEFORM MODELLING\n\nWe will use the two waveform models developed in paper I of this series to explore the precision with which the\nvarious ET network configurations will be able to determine the source parameters. Full details of the waveforms are\ngiven in [20], but we briefly summarise the models here.\nBoth waveform models include inspiral, merger and ringdown in a consistent way. We model the inspiral phase\nevolution, in both models, using the \"numerical kludge\" waveform model described in [18]. The \"numerical kludge\"\napproach consists of computing the orbital trajectory that the inspiralling body follows in the Boyer\u2013Lindquist coordinates of the Kerr spacetime of the central black hole. We assume an adiabatic evolution in which the inspiralling\nbody is moving on a geodesic and use the fluxes of energy E and angular momentum Lz derived in [25] to evolve the\nparameters of the geodesic. In this paper, we restrict our attention to circular and equatorial inspirals. Subsequently,\nwe numerically integrate the geodesic equations along this inspiral trajectory and obtain the Boyer\u2013Lindquist coordinates of the small object as a function of time. Finally, we construct a gravitational waveform from the inspiral\ntrajectory using a flat\u2013spacetime wave\u2013emission formula. This scheme, which was developed for the modelling of\nEMRI systems for LISA, has several useful features: a) the waveforms have been checked against more accurate,\nTeukolsky\u2013based, waveforms for test-particles on geodesic orbits and the overlap exceeds 0.95 over a large portion of\nthe parameter space [18]; b) they are computationally inexpensive; c) conservative self\u2013force corrections to this model\nhave been derived [19] for Kerr circular\u2013equatorial orbits at 2PN order. Nonetheless, this model is, at present, incomplete in several ways, e.g., conservative corrections are not yet known for generic orbits; the phase space trajectories\nare approximate, although they have been matched to Teukolsky based evolutions; and the waveform is constructed\nfrom the trajectory using a flat\u2013spacetime wave\u2013emission formula. Nevertheless, this approach should capture the\nmain features of the inspiral waveform accurately.\nThe two models differ in their treatment of the plunge and merger phases. The first model, valid for IMBHs of\narbitrary spin, employs the transition scheme developed by Ori & Thorne [1] to smoothly match the inspiral phase onto\nthe transition to plunge. In the spirit of the \"numerical kludge waveform\", we derive an approximate waveform from\nthis transition trajectory using a flat\u2013spacetime emission formulae applied to the transition orbit and plunge geodesic\ngiven by the transition model [20]. The inspiral waveform includes the dominant modes l = m = 2, l = \u2212m = 2 only\nand so, for consistency, we included only the same two dominant modes in the expression for the waveform generated\nduring the merger phase.\nThe second model, used for non\u2013spinning central black holes, uses the EOB prescription [21, 22] to describe the\nplunge and merger phases. The EOB model is a framework in which the motion of a binary is represented as the\neffective motion of a test object in a background. Although we use the EOB model only in the non-spinning limit,\nan extension of the EOB scheme does exist which includes leading\u2013order spin\u2013orbit and spin\u2013spin dynamical effects\nof a binary system for an \"effective test particle\" moving in a Kerr\u2013type metric [26], and next\u2013to\u2013leading\u2013order\nspin\u2013orbit couplings [27]. However, it has been recently found [28] that it is not straightforward to include higher\u2013\norder non\u2013spinning PN couplings, such as the 4PN and 5PN adjustable parameters that were recently calibrated to\nnumerical relativity simulations for non-spinning systems [29, 30], using these Hamiltonians [26, 27]. Additionally,\nthe EOB Hamiltonian in [27] does not reduce to the Hamiltonian of a spinning test particle in the Kerr spacetime.\nA resolution to this issue was recently proposed in [31], in which a canonical Hamiltonian was derived for a spinning\ntest particle in a generic curved spacetime, to linear order in the particle spin. In turn, this canonical Hamiltonian\nhas been used to construct an improved EOB Hamiltonian [32]. Additionally, the EOB model has recently been used\n\n\f5\nto model circular\u2013equatorial extreme\u2013mass\u2013ratio inspirals (EMRIs) around spinning supermassive black holes, using\nfits of various post\u2013Newtonian parameters to Teukolsky\u2013based waveforms [33]. This is the same approach that was\npreviously used with great success for non-spinning black hole systems, e.g., to derive fits for the final mass and spin\nof a BH after merger that are consistent with NR to about \u223c 2% accuracy [34]. We used the non-spinning EOB\nmodel only in this work because that model is more mature. However, comparisons between an IMRI model based\non the spinning EOB framework [33] and the waveforms constructed using the transition model should be pursued in\nthe future.\nThe final ingredient, again common to both models, is the ringdown waveform. This originates from the distorted\nKerr black hole formed after merger, and consists of a superposition of quasinormal modes (QNMs). Each mode\nhas a complex frequency, whose real part is the oscillatory frequency, and whose imaginary part is the inverse of the\ndamping time. Following Berti, et. al. [35], and Buonanno, et. al. [36], we developed a RD model that includes\nthe fundamental mode (l = 2, m = 2, n = 0) and two overtones (n = 1, 2). QNMs always come in pairs which are\ncalled \"twin modes\". In general, a mode with a given (l, m) will always contain a superposition of two different\ndamped exponentials [35], one with positive real part of the frequency, and the other with negative real part of the\nfrequency and different damping time. Omitting these modes would have no serious consequences for non\u2013rotating\nblack holes, but it is conceptually inconsistent for rotating black holes. Furthermore, a single\u2013mode expansion restricts\nattention to circularly polarized gravitational waves. For full generality, we use a general superposition of modes. The\nfrequencies and damping times of the QNMs depend on the mass and spin after merger of the newly formed Kerr\nBH and to estimate these we made use of fits for the final mass and spin found in [21, 37]. The various QNMs are\nattached to the plunge and merger waveform at the effective light ring by imposing the continuity of the waveform\nand all necessary higher order time derivatives.\nPart of the motivation in developing a waveform model using the transition model of Ori & Thorne is to enable a\nmore straightforward extension of this present waveform model for circular\u2013equatorial IMRIs to a waveform model\nfor generic (eccentric\u2013inclined) IMRIs. The \"numerical kludge\" inspiral waveform [25] and the transition model [38]\nare both already available for generic orbits. The mass\u2013ratio regime that we explore in these papers has not been as\nexhaustively explored as the comparable\u2013mass\u2013ratio and extreme\u2013mass\u2013ratio regimes. While the present paper was\nbeing prepared, results of a numerical simulation were published which shed light on the gravitational energy and\nmomenta radiated by BH binaries with mass\u2013ratios of 100:1 [39]. However, this was the first numerical simulation in\nthe IMRI regime. The schemes described here combine elements of comparable mass and extreme-mass-ratio models\nin a logical way, but it cannot presently be tested against accurate simulations. As numerical and analytic models\nimprove, these models should be refined. Nonetheless, the models should capture the main features of real IMRI\nwaveforms and therefore be adequate for our purposes, namely to scope out the parameter estimation accuracies that\nmight be achievable with ET. By using two alternative models we can build up confidence in the results. In [20] we\ncompared the two waveform models for non\u2013spinning systems and demonstrated that the waveforms agreed well in\nboth phase and amplitude, with differences at the level of a few percent. We show sample waveforms computed using\nthe two models in Figure 2. The close agreement for non-spinning systems is clear from the figure in the lower panel.\nIn this paper, we will now use these models to estimate the precision with which different third-generation detector\nnetworks will be able to estimate the parameters of the various binary systems listed above.\nIV.\n\nSIGNAL ANALYSIS\n\nIn this section we will briefly review the aspects of signal analysis relevant to our calculations. A GW detector is a\nlinear system whose input is the GWs we want to detect and whose output is a time series, which is a combination\nof the GW signals and instrumental noise. Any number of coplanar and colocated detectors have a response to GWs\nthat can be written as a linear combination of the responses of two right\u2013angle detectors offset by 45\u25e6 . The output\nof each of these two equivalent two-arm Michelson detectors can be represented as\ns\u03b1 (t) = h\u03b1 (t) + n\u03b1 (t),\n\n\u03b1 = I, II,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere I, II denote the data streams from the two detectors. The detection problem is to distinguish h\u03b1 (t) from n\u03b1 (t).\nWith the assumptions that (a) each Fourier component of the noise \u00f1\u03b1 (f ) has a Gaussian probability distribution;\nand (b) the noise is stationary, i.e., the different Fourier components are uncorrelated, the ensemble average of the\nFourier components of the noise have the property\nh\u00f1\u03b1 (f ) \u00f1\u03b2 (f \u2032 )\u2217 i =\n\n1\n\u03b4(f \u2212 f \u2032 )Sn (f )\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 .\n2\n\nThis relation defines the one-sided spectral density of the instrumental noise, Sn (f ).\n\n(2)\n\n\f6\n60\n\n8\n6\n\n40\n\n4\n20\nhI(t)/ (Sh(f(t))1/2\n\nhI(t)/ (Sh(f(t))1/2\n\n2\n0\n\n-20\n\n0\n-2\n-4\n\n-40\n-6\n-60\n\n-80\n7.5\n\n-8\n\n7.55\n\n7.6\n\n7.65\n\n7.7\n7.75\nTime [seconds]\n\n7.8\n\n7.85\n\n7.9\n\n-10\n54.6\n\n54.65\n\n30\n\n54.7\n\n54.75\nTime [seconds]\n\n54.8\n\n54.85\n\n54.9\n\nTransition\nEOB\n\n20\n\nhI(t)/ (Sh(f(t))1/2\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n-20\n\n-30\n\n-40\n4.55\n\n4.6\n\n4.65\n\n4.7\nTime [seconds]\n\n4.75\n\n4.8\n\n4.85\n\nFIG. 2: We show inspiral, merger and ringdown gravitational waveforms for compact objects of mass 10 M\u2299 (top left panel and\n1.4M\u2299 (top right panel), inspiraling into a 500M\u2299 BH with spin parameter q = 0.3. The bottom panel shows the gravitational\nwaveform for a binary system consisting of a compact object of mass 10 M\u2299 and a non-spinning (q = 0) IMBH of mass 500M\u2299 ,\ncomputed using both the EOB and transition models. In each case, the various extrinsic parameters were chosen randomly.\n\nWe wish to estimate the parameters of a system from which we have detected gravitational waves. If the expected\nwaveform h(t; \u03b8) depends on parameters \u03b8 = {\u03b81 , ..., \u03b8N }, we want to construct the posterior probability of the\nparameters given the data and from that we will find the most probable value of the parameters of the source and\ntheir respective uncertainties.\nThere is a natural inner product on the vector space of signals, which for any two signals p\u03b1 (t), q\u03b1 (t), takes the\nform\nX Z \u221e \u0014 p\u0303\u2217 (f )q\u0303\u03b1 (f ) + p\u0303\u03b1 (f )q\u0303 \u2217 (f ) \u0015\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n(p | q) \u2261 2\ndf.\n(3)\nSn (f )\n0\n\u03b1\nThe probability distribution for Gaussian noise, n(t), is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(n0 | n0 )\np(n0 ) = N exp \u2212\n,\n2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere N is a normalization factor. This relation gives the probability that the actual noise realization is n0 . If the\n~ + n0 (t). Using this relation and Equation (4),\nsource had parameters ~\n\u03b8, the output would have the form s(t) = h(t; \u03b8)\nwe obtain the likelihood of observing the output s(t) if the signal had parameters ~\u03b8\n\u0011\uf8f6\n\uf8eb \u0010\n\u0010 \u0011\ns0 \u2212 h(~\u03b8)| s0 \u2212 h(~\u03b8)\n\uf8f8.\n(5)\n\u039b s|\u03b8\u0303 = N exp \uf8ed\u2212\n2\n\n\f7\nWe can use Eq. (5) in Bayes' theorem, which states that the posterior probability is proportional to the product of the\nlikelihood function and the prior probability. The prior describes the degree of belief, before a measurement is made,\nthat a GW signal in the data would have parameters ~\u03b8, and the posterior probability describes the corresponding\ndegree of belief after the measurement. Denoting the prior by p0 (~\u03b8), the posterior probability for the parameters ~\u03b8,\ngiven the observed output s, is given by [40]\n\u0012\u0010\n\u0011\u0013\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0011 1\u0010\nh(~\u03b8) | h(~\u03b8)\n.\n(6)\np h(~\n\u03b8) | s \u221d p0 (~\u03b8)exp\nh(~\u03b8) | s \u2212\n2\n\u0010\n\u0011\nAs p h(~\u03b8) | s is a distribution in ~\n\u03b8 for a fixed output s, the term (s | s) /2 can be absorbed into the normalization\nfactor. This probability distribution function describes the information we can extract from the data stream once the\nprior is specified.\nIn the absence of an actual data set, we cannot compute this posterior probability distribution, but we can estimate\nhow broad the posterior is likely to be and hence how well we might constrain the parameters. Assuming a flat\nprior (or a locally-flat prior which would be a reasonable assumption for a signal of high signal-to-noise ratio), the\nmaximum posterior probability is the maximum-likelihood value, which minimizes (s \u2212 h | s \u2212 h). This is also the\npoint in parameter space with the highest matched filtering signal\u2013to\u2013noise ratio (SNR)\nS\n(s | h)\n[h(\u03b8i )] = p\n.\nN\n(h | h)\n\n(7)\n\nWe can expand Eq. (6) about this peak, \u03b8\u0302 by setting \u03b8i = \u03b8\u02c6i + \u2206\u03b8i to obtain\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202h \u2202h\n\u2212 12 \u0393ij \u2206\u03b8 i \u2206\u03b8 j\n.\n,\n\u0393ij \u2261\np(\u2206\u03b8 | s) \u2248 N e\n\u2202\u03b8i \u2202\u03b8j |\u03b8=\u03b8\u0302\n\n(8)\n\n\u0393ij is the Fisher Information Matrix. This approximation is valid for large SNR. The correlation matrix of the errors\n\u2206\u03b8i is given by\n\u2206\u03b8i \u2206\u03b8j = (\u0393\u22121 )ij .\n\n(9)\n\nWe shall make use of Eq. (9) to estimate parameter errors for the various binaries described in Section II B. For white\nnoise, i.e., Sn (f ) = const., Parseval's theorem allows us to rewrite the inner product (3) in the simple form [41]\nZ\n1 X \u221e\np\u03b1 (t)q\u03b1 (t)dt.\n(10)\n2\nSn \u03b1 \u2212\u221e\nWe shall make use of this alternative formulation of the inner product to simplify our analysis. If we define the\n\"noise\u2013weighted\" waveform\nh\u03b1 (t)\n\u0125\u03b1 (t) \u2261 q\n\u0001,\nSh f (t)\n\nf (t) =\n\n1 d\u03c6\n,\n\u03c0 dt\n\n(11)\n\nwe can then rewrite the Fisher matrix approximately as [41]\n\u0393ab = 2\n\nXZ\n\u03b1\n\n0\n\nT\n\n\u2202a \u0125\u03b1 (t)\u2202b \u0125\u03b1 (t)dt ,\n\nwhere \u2202a \u2261 \u2202/\u2202\u03b8a .\n\n(12)\n\nAs discussed in [20], the binaries we shall consider have relatively low SNR and it is known that in such situations\nthe Fisher Matrix may overestimate measurement accuracies. Vallisneri [42] gave a mismatch criterion to determine\nwhether Fisher Matrix results were reliable in a particular context. The idea is to compute the ratio r(\u03b8, A) of the\nlinearized signal amplitude (LSA) likelihood to the exact likelihood. This ratio r is given by [42]\n| log r(\u03b8, A)| = (\u2206\u03b8j hj \u2212 \u2206h(\u03b8), \u2206\u03b8k hk \u2212 \u2206h(\u03b8)) ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere A represents the signal strength, \u2206h(\u03b8) = h(\u03b8)\u2212h(\u03b8\u0302), with \u03b8 = \u03b8\u0302 +\u2206\u03b8, and \u03b8\u0302 the observed location of maximum\nLSA likelihood for a given experiment. We use the consistency criterion, Eq. (13), to explore the 1\u2013\u03c3 likelihood surface\n\n\f8\npredicted by the Fisher Matrix to verify that the mismatch between the LSA and the exact likelihoods is small. Ratios\nbelow a fiducial value, say | log r(\u03b8, A)| \u223c 0.1, are considered acceptable [42].\nAs an example of typical results obtained from this analysis, for (10M\u2299 , 100M\u2299) binaries with q = 0.3, we found that\nsystems near the lower quartile of the distribution had | log r(\u03b8, A)| \u223c 0.2. From this threshold onwards, the ratio r\ndecreases gradually so that at the upper quartile of the distribution we obtain | log r(\u03b8, A)| \u223c 0.04. This indicates that\nthe results we get from the Fisher Matrix should be a reasonable estimate of the measurement precisions achievable\nfor IMRIs using ET. Our results may be somewhat optimistic and at some point should be verified using Monte Carlo\nsimulations to recover the full posterior probability distributions. Such an exercise is beyond the scope of this present\nwork. Nonetheless, the results should be fairly accurate, and we will see in Section V that, where comparisons can be\nmade, our results are in good accord with previous results that have been derived for other types of binary and using\ndifferent waveform models.\nThe Fisher matrix for a network of detectors is given by the sum of the individual Fisher Matrices for each detector.\nWhen modelling the response of the various detectors, it is necessary to account for their relative positions on the\nsurface of the Earth, as the corresponding time delays are what allow source triangulation. In computing the waveforms\nused in the Fisher Matrix, we found it convenient to use two different timesteps in order to separately resolve the\n(slow) inspiral and (fast) merger/ringdown phases. We checked that varying the choice of timesteps and the location\nof the transition between the two timesteps did not significantly affect the results for any of the systems considered.\nWe will discuss the convergence of the Fisher Matrices further in Section V.\nV.\n\nPARAMETER ESTIMATION ERROR RESULTS\n\nThe parameter space of the signals we shall consider is 10 dimensional. Four of these are intrinsic parameters,\nnamely ln m, ln M, q, t0 . The other six are extrinsic parameters. We summarize the physical meaning of all the\nparameters in Table I.\nTo explore parameter estimation errors using the inverse Fisher Matrix we fix the values of the intrinsic parameters\nof the source, and carry out a Monte Carlo simulation over possible values for the extrinsic parameters. The parameter\nerrors scale with the SNR of the source as 1/SNR, so we can quote results at a fixed SNR and these may be easily\nextrapolated to other SNRs. We chose a reference SNR of 30, as this would represent a very robust detection for\nwhich the Fisher Matrix prediction is likely to be a good estimate. To obtain this reference result, we first compute\nthe Fisher Matrix for a source at a fixed distance, D = 6.6348Gpc, and obtain the SNR at that distance from the\nexpression\nX Z tLSO\nSNR2 = 2\n\u01252\u03b1 (t)dt.\n(14)\n\u03b1=I,II\n\ntinit\n\nWe then multiply the errors estimated from the Fisher Matrix by (SNR/30) to normalise to the reference SNR of 30.\nWe assume that the observation starts when the GWs from the inspiral reach a frequency of 5Hz and finishes when\nthe RD waveform is no longer contributing to the SNR.\nln m\nln M\nq\nt0\n\u03c60\n\u03b8S\n\u03c6S\n\u03b8K\n\u03c6K\nln D\n\nmass of compact object (CO)\nmass of IMBH\nmagnitude of (specific) spin angular momentum of IMBH\ntime at which orbital frequency sweeps through a reference value\ninitial phase of CO orbit\nsource sky colatitude in an ecliptic\u2013based system\nsource sky azimuth in an ecliptic\u2013based system\ndirection of IMBH spin (colatitude)\ndirection of IMBH spin (azimuth)\ndistance to source\n\nTABLE I: This table shows the physical meaning of the parameters used in our model. The angles (\u03b8S , \u03c6S ) and (\u03b8K , \u03c6K ) are defined in\na fixed ecliptic\u2013based coordinate system.\n\n\f9\nA.\n\nDependence of parameter estimation errors on system parameters\n\nWe consider the twelve different binary systems described in Section II B. For the sources with q = 0.3, 0.9\nwe present results computed from the transition model for the waveform. For the non-spinning systems, q = 0,\nwe present results from both the transition model and the EOB model. The Tables II\u2013V list the mean, standard\ndeviation, median and lower and upper quartiles of the distribution of the Fisher Matrix errors computed in the\nMonte Carlo simulation. There is one table for each of the four mass combinations we consider and all results are\ncomputed at the fixed reference SNR of 30. These results assume that the detection is made using the optimistic 3\nET network configuration, and hence should be considered as upper bounds on the accuracy with which we may be\nable to measure the various parameters.\nIn Figure 3 we show histograms of the error estimates for several parameters found in the Monte Carlo simulation\nfor the m = 10M\u2299 , M = 100M\u2299, q = 0.9 system. This figure, and Table II, indicate that a network of 3 ETs might be\nable to determine the location of the source in the sky to an accuracy of \u223c 10\u22123 steradians, i.e., \u223c 4 square degrees.\nThis estimate is the statistical mean of the Monte Carlo distribution at SNR of 30 assuming the optimistic detector\nnetwork of three ETs in the geographic locations of Virgo, LIGO Livingston and Perth, Australia (AIGO).\nRecent work has shown that for the existing LIGO-Virgo detector network, assuming a uniform distribution of\nsources across the sky, at a network SNR of around 15, 50% of inspiral sources should be located within 23 sq\u2013degs\n(best case) at the 95% confidence level. For burst sources, without any knowledge of the waveform, 50% of the sources\ncould be localized within 50 sq\u2013degs (worst case) at an SNR of 10, but this can be reduced to 8 sq\u2013degs if predicted\nwaveforms are available [43]. These estimates are similar for the initial or advanced detectors [43], at a fixed SNR.\nThe inclusion of an additional detector in the Southern Hemisphere, such as AIGO, can further improve these values\nas it contributes a longer baseline, additional energy flux, extended signal space, and breaks the plane\u2013degeneracy\nformed by the three detector network of LIGO Livingston, LIGO Hanford and Virgo [43].\nAnother recent independent study [44] presented results for the accuracy with which sources could be localized\nwith a network of GW detectors, using only timing information in the various detectors. Fairhurst [44] found that\nincreasing the number of detectors at different sites increases both the absolute number of observable sources, and\ngreatly increases the fraction of sources that can be well localized. For instance, at a fixed SNR of 8, and using the\nadvanced detector network comprising the two LIGO detectors at Hanford (HH) and LIGO Livingston (L), no sources\ncan be localized within 20 sq\u2013degs. Adding another detector at a different site, e.g., a LIGO detector in Australia\n(A), or Advanced Virgo (V), or the Japanese LCGT detector (J), the networks HLA, HHLV, HHJL, can localize up to\n50% of the signals within 20 sq\u2013degs, and the loudest signals within 5 sq\u2013degs. In all these results, it was found that\nfor the networks involving an Australian detector, the peak of the localization distributions occurs between 5 and 10\nsq\u2013degs. Our results imply that we can determine the location of the source in the sky to an accuracy of \u223c 12 sq\u2013degs\nwhen we renormalise to a network SNR of 8. This estimate is the statistical median value obtained from the Monte\nCarlo simulations. Our results are therefore in good accord with existing estimates of the angular resolution that\ncould be achieved by the advanced detector network. Furthermore, Table II shows that for non\u2013spinning systems, we\nshould resolve the plunge time t0 to within \u223c 30 ms when normalised to an SNR of 10. This estimate is also in good\naccord with the results obtained independently by Ajith et al. [45] and Luna et al. [46].\nThe Monte Carlo simulations also show that we expect to determine the total mass of m = 10M\u2299 , M = 100M\u2299\nbinaries to an accuracy of \u223c 0.1% for non\u2013spinning systems when we renomalise the results to an SNR of 8. This\nestimate is in good accord with previous estimates for related systems. In [47] it was estimated that using the same\n3ET detector network that we have considered in this paper, it should be possible to determine the total mass of a\nnon=spinning m = 23M\u2299 , M = 100M\u2299 binary (mass ratio \u03b7 = 0.16) to an accuracy of \u223c 0.1% at a network SNR\nof 8. This estimate was obtained using the phenomenological waveform model described in [48], which includes the\ninspiral, merger and ringdown for non-spinning, comparable-mass binaries in a consistent way.\nFigure 4 shows the accuracy with which we expect to determine the masses of the small CO and the IMBH for the\nspinning systems, as well as the IMBH's spin parameter q. This figure shows that for binaries that stay the longest in\nband, namely the m = 1.4M\u2299 , M = 100M\u2299, q = 0.3 system ( \u223c 291 seconds in band), we can determine the masses\nof the CO and the IMBH to an accuracy of 0.01%, 0.005%, respectively, at the reference SNR of 30. The accuracy\ngradually decreases for the shorter\u2013lived events. For instance, for binaries with m = 10M\u2299 , M = 500M\u2299 , q = 0.3,\nwhich stay in band about \u223c 8.3 seconds, we expect to measure the CO's and IMBH's masses to an accuracy of only\n\u223c 0.15%, \u223c 0.05% respectively, at the same SNR of 30.\nWe expect to determine the spin parameter more accurately for rapidly rotating binaries. For instance, the estimated\naccuracy with which we can measure the IMBH's spin for binaries with m = 10M\u2299 , M = 100M\u2299 , q = 0.9 is \u223c 0.05%.\nThis is about a factor of 2 better than for binaries with the same component masses but with spin q = 0.3. We would\nexpect this trend since, for more rapidly spinning systems, the small CO comes much closer to the outer horizon of\nthe Kerr IMBH before merging, and this is the regime where the CO can more strongly feel the effects of the IMBH's\nspin. We note that the percentage error in the spin is quite similar in the two cases. This is consistent with this\n\n\f0.06\n\n0.06\n\n0.05\n\n0.05\n\n0.04\n\n0.04\nNumber\n\nNumber\n\n10\n\n0.03\n\n0.03\n\n0.02\n\n0.02\n\n0.01\n\n0.01\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.0003\n\n0.0006\n\n0.0009\nError\n\n0.0012\n\n0.0015\n\n0\n\n0.0018\n\n0.06\n\n0\n\n0.00015\n\n0.0003\nError\n\n0.00045\n\n0.0006\n\n0.05\n0.045\n\n0.05\n\n0.04\n0.035\n\n0.04\nNumber\n\nNumber\n\n0.03\n0.03\n\n0.025\n0.02\n\n0.02\n\n0.015\n0.01\n\n0.01\n\n0.005\n0\n\n0\n\n0.0001\n\n0.0002\n\n0.0003\n\n0.0004\nError\n\n0.0005\n\n0.0006\n\n0\n\n0.0007\n\n0.04\n\n0\n\n0.005\n\n0.01\n\n0.015\n\n0.02\nError\n\n0.025\n\n0.03\n\n0.035\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.1\n\n0.04\n\n0.05\n0.045\n\n0.035\n\n0.04\n0.03\n0.035\n0.03\nNumber\n\nNumber\n\n0.025\n0.02\n\n0.025\n0.02\n\n0.015\n\n0.015\n0.01\n0.01\n0.005\n0\n\n0.005\n-0.02\n\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\nError\n\n0.08\n\n0.1\n\n0.12\n\n0\n\n-0.02\n\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\nError\n\nFIG. 3: Distribution of parameter measurement error estimates computed in the Monte Carlo simulations.

There is a pair of candlesticks for each of the four binary systems. For each binary,\nthe candlestick representing the CO's mass error estimate is to the left of that for the IMBH's mass error estimate. The error\nbars indicate the lower and upper quartiles found in the Monte Carlo simulation. Right panel: expected measurement errors in\nthe IMBH's spin parameter for two different values for the spin parameter q. For each system, the candlestick corresponding to\na central IMBH with q = 0.3 is to the right of that associated with the error estimate for a system with q = 0.9. The continuous,\nlong\u2013dashed, dashed and dotted lines represent systems B1: m = 10M\u2299 , M = 100M\u2299 , B2: m = 1.4M\u2299 , M = 100M\u2299 , B3:\nm = 10M\u2299 , M = 500M\u2299 , and B4: m = 1.4M\u2299 , M = 500M\u2299 , respectively.\n\nunderstanding - the spin is measured more precisely when it is larger because it has a correspondingly greater effect\non the system. For less massive COs, the inspiral proceeds more slowly and the early inspiral has a correspondingly\ngreater importance in the estimation of the system parameters. For such systems, we might expect the precision of\nspin determination to be les sensitive to the system spin, and this is borne out by our results - the spin precision is\ncomparable for q = 0.9 and q = 0.3 in the 1.4M\u2299 + 100M\u2299 and 1.4M\u2299 + 500M\u2299 systems.\nIn general, we expect that the precision with which we can measure the parameters of a binary depends on the\nnumber of GW cycles that are observed. Therefore, we might expect the precision to depend on the source masses\nas, from best to worst, 1.4M\u2299 + 100M\u2299, 1.4M\u2299 + 500M\u2299, 10M\u2299 + 100M\u2299, 10M\u2299 + 500M\u2299. Tables II\u2013V, and\nFigure 4 confirms this expectation. These Tables also show that the precision improves for more rapidly spinning\nIMBHs. This is because, for greater spins, the inspiral phase evolution lasts longer and so there are more cycles of\ninformation in the waveform. The SNR of the spinning systems will also be larger at a given distance, as compared\nwith slowly spinning IMBHs, so these systems can be seen further away. This does not affect the results quoted here,\nwhich are normalised to fixed SNR=30. Tables II\u2013V also confirm that our two independent waveform models make\npredictions for the parameter estimation errors for non-spinning systems that are consistent to better than ten per\ncent.\nFinally, we note that the consistency of the distributions of Figure 3, in the sense that they are smooth with\nfew outliers, is an indication that the results are convergent. It is well known that Fisher Matrices encountered in\nparameter estimation calculations for GW sources can have very large condition numbers. However, the results we\npresent here were obtained from Fisher Matrices that exhibited convergence over at least two orders of magnitude\nin the offsets used to compute the numerical waveform derivatives. The inverse matrices were computed using an\nLU decomposition, and we verified that the inverse Fisher matrices were also convergent to <\n\u223c 10% over an order of\nmagnitude in the numerical offsets. We also found that the offsets required for the various network configurations\nwere consistent, as we would expect, since the convergence of the FM should depend on the intrinsic waveform, rather\nthan the choice of network.\nB.\n\nDependence of parameter estimation errors on network configuration\n\nWe shall now consider the more modest network configurations C1\u2013C4 described earlier, which consist of combinations of ET's and right\u2013angle detectors at 2 or 3 sites chosen from Virgo, LIGO Livingston and Perth (Australia).\n\n\f12\nThese results are shown in Tables VI\u2013IX1 for the four different mass combinations, but with the central IMBH spin\nfixed at q = 0.3. As expected, we find that a single ET is sufficient for accurate intrinsic parameter determination.\nThis is because the signature of the intrinsic parameters is encoded in the phase evolution which can be accurately\nmeasured by a single instrument. After normalising the parameter errors to a fixed network SNR of 30, Figure 5\nshows clearly that the accuracy with which we can measure the intrinsic parameters of a binary is not dramatically\nchanged by changes in the network configuration.\n\nFIG. 5: Arranged from left to right in the panel, we show the expected measurement errors in the CO's mass, IMBH mass and\nIMBH spin parameter, as a function of the network configuration for binary systems with masses 10M\u2299 + 100M\u2299 and IMBH\nspin q = 0.3. In each group the candlesticks are arranged in order C1\u2013C5 from left to right. As before, the CO and IMBH\nmass errors are quoted as fractional errors, i.e., these are the errors in ln(m), ln(M ).\n\nHowever, it is not possible to constrain the location of the source in the sky nor the luminosity distance using a\nsingle detector. This is also expected, as the determination of the extrinsic parameters comes primarily from the\ntime\u2013delays between the arrival of the signal in different detectors. It appears that the inclusion of an additional\nright\u2013angle detector (configuration C2) is enough to constrain the source sky position and luminosity distance to\nmoderate precision \u223c 30 sq\u2013degs, \u223c 15% for a 10M\u2299 BH IMRI into a 100M\u2299 IMBH with spin q = 0.3 at SNR of 30.\nReplacing this right\u2013angle detector by another ET at the same location (configuration C3) enhances the determination\nof these parameters to \u223c 12 sq\u2013degs, \u223c 10%, respectively. If we consider a configuration consisting of 1 ET, plus two\nright\u2013angle detectors (configuration C4) these estimates are further improved to \u223c 11 sq\u2013degs, \u223c 10%, respectively.\nThese two estimates are rather close to the precision we expect to obtain using a 3 ET network, namely, \u223c 8 sq\u2013degs,\n\u223c 10%, respectively.\nMoreover, these results also show that the distributions become narrower for the more complex configurations, i.e.,\nthere is less variation in the precisions with which we can determine the extrinsic parameters as we randomise over\nthe source position and orientation. This is also expected, as a more complex network should provide more complete\nsky coverage. We can compare our results for the luminosity distance in the non\u2013spinning limit with those quoted\nin Table I of [47], which were given at a network SNR of 8. Renormalising our results for the non\u2013spinning systems\nto an SNR of 8, we estimate that network C2 would be able to measure the luminosity distance to an accuracy of\n\u223c 40%. For configuration C3, we would be able to determine the luminosity distance to an accuracy of 30% and for\nC4, this improves marginally to \u223c 28%. This estimate is roughly the same for the 3ET detector network (C5). These\nestimates are in good accord with Table I of [47], which were computed for a \u223c 20M\u2299 + 100M\u2299 binary system using\na comparable-mass inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model. This comparison provides further support that even if\nthe IMRI models used in this paper are not accurate enough to be used for detection of IMRI systems, they do still\ngive reasonable results and can be used for parameter estimation studies to illustrate the potential scientific impact\nof the ET.\nIn summary, a single ET will be enough to measure the intrinsic parameters of a system but will not be sufficient\nto accurately reconstruct the extrinsic parameters. Extrinsic parameter determination is possible with the addition of\n\n1\n\nNote that only Table VI is included in the main text. Tables VII\u2013IX may be found in Appendix A.\n\n\f13\none right-angle detector, but a 2 ET configuration will improve the accuracy with which we can measure the source's\nsky position and luminosity distance by roughly a factor of \u223c 2. A more optimistic configuration consisting of a single\nET and two right-angle detectors upgraded to ET's sensitivity will generate results that are competitive with the\nhighly optimistic three ET network. This configuration (C3) might be more realistic, since it will have lower overall\ncosts, although it is not simply an upgrade of existing sites as we are assuming 10km scale right-angle interferometers.\nTables II\u2013IX show that GW observations will produce valuable astrophysical results. A network of 2 ETs operating\nin coincidence will be able to measure accurately the masses of two merging black holes, and less accurately the sky\nposition and luminosity distance at which the merger is taking place. The results in paper I [20] suggested that a\na few tens to a few hundreds of IMRI events could be detected per year by an ET network, provided that IMBHs\nare relatively abundant in globular clusters, and the various mechanisms leading to CO capture - secular Kozai\nresonance, binary exchange processes, gravitational radiation and three and four\u2013body interactions - are efficient at\nstarting IMRIs. The ET network would be able to achieve good parameter determinations for all the systems that\nare detected, which will have important scientific implications.\nOne important question will be whether the IMBHs detected have been formed in clusters, or are primordial,\npopulation III, black holes formed in the early Universe. The precision achievable with network C4, of \u223c 11 sq\u2013degs\nin sky position and \u223c 10% in luminosity distance will not be enough to determine the host galaxy of an IMRI uniquely,\nlet alone if it is occurring in a cluster within that galaxy. If the the ET low-frequency cut-off does extend down to\n1Hz, these precisions improve to \u223c 1 sq\u2013degs, and \u223c 7%, but even that is unlikely to be enough. However, primordial\nIMBHs are likely to be hosted in dwarf galaxies today, and the stellar density is sufficiently low that is very unlikely\nthat IMRIs could occur there [11]. Thus, it would be a reasonable assumption that any IMRIs detected would be from\ncluster IMBHs and not population III black holes. The measured masses and IMBH spins thus provide constraints\non the cluster IMBH population, and their evolution.\nIMRI systems could be detected up to redshifts as high as z \u223c 6, if the system has redshifted masses [10 + 100]M\u2299\nand IMBH spin q = 0.9, assuming a 3ET network with a frequency cut\u2013off of 1Hz [20]. At such redshifts, the existence\nof light black holes, no matter how they formed, provides some constraints on the hierarchical assembly of structure.\nIf IMBHs exist at z \u223c 6, they will inevitably grow and may be progenitors of some fraction of today's supermassive\nblack holes. IMRI detections with ET could therefore be important for cosmology, which relies on the ability to\nconfidently say that an event is at high redshift, which we have demonstrated is possible.\nA redshift z \u223c 6 is probably not high enough to provide strong constraints on structure growth, but ET might also\ndetect IMBHs when they merge with comparable mass IMBHs, and these can be seen out to redshifts z >\n\u223c 10 [11, 47].\nAgain, the IMBHs involved in such mergers could form either in clusters or in the early Universe. As many as a few\ntens of mergers involving primordial IMBHs could be detected by ET [47] in the light-seed scenario. The number\nof comparable mass mergers of IMBHs formed in clusters could be much higher, as many as several thousand [11],\nbut this is very dependent on the efficiency of IMBH formation in the cluster environment. As mentioned above,\nthe IMRIs detected by ET are most likely to be occurring in clusters and thus provide a direct constraint on the\nexistence, number density and properties of IMBHs in clusters. This information can be used to estimate how many\nof the observed IMBH-IMBH mergers might be coming from the cluster channel and hence what fraction of events\nmight be primordial. IMRI observations will therefore also have indirect applications to our understanding of structure\nformation.\nThe Monte Carlo results we present in this paper are the first results for IMRI sources detectable by ET to appear\nin the literature. The results must be taken with some caution, because of the approximations in the waveform models\nthat have been made, as discussed earlier. However, these results should be a reasonable guide to the likely order-ofmagnitude of the parameter measurement errors that will be achievable. The precise astrophysical implications will\ndepend primarily on the number of events that are seen, which is very difficult to predict given current uncertainties\nin the astrophysics of IMBHs, and indeed their very existence.\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper, we have used the gravitational waveform models for IMRIs developed in paper I of this series [20] to\nestimate the precision with which the Einstein Telescope will be able to determine the parameters of circular\u2013equatorial\nIMRIs. We have presented results for a set of twelve \"typical\" systems, comprising four different combinations of\ncomponent masses - 1.4M\u2299 + 100M\u2299, 1.4M\u2299 + 500M\u2299, 10M\u2299 + 100M\u2299, and 10M\u2299 + 500M\u2299 - and three different\nIMBH spins - q = 0, 0.3, 0.9. For the non\u2013spinning systems, we have compared the results from the transition model\nand the EOB waveform model and found that these models make predictions that are consistent to better than ten\npercent. This final check provides confidence in these results.\nWe have also explored how the accuracy of parameter determination depends on the configuration of the detector\nnetwork using the \"ET\u2013B\" noise curve and assuming a cut\u2013off frequency of 5Hz. We have shown that a single ET\n\n\f14\n\nModel\nMean\nSt. Dev.\nq=0.9 L.Qt.\nMed.\nU. Qt.\nMean\nSt. Dev.\nq=0.3 L.Qt.\nMed.\nU. Qt.\nMean\nSt. Dev.\nq=0\nL.Qt.\nMed.\nU.

A network of 2 ETs should be sufficient to measure\nthe source's sky position and luminosity distance to accuracies of \u223c 12 sq\u2013degs and \u223c 10%, respectively, for a BH\nIMRI into a 100M\u2299 IMBH with spin q = 0.3. A more sophisticated network comprising 1 ET and two right-angle\ndetectors would have comparable precisions. The results for the latter networks are comparable to the precisions that\ncould be achieved with a 3 ET network, which are \u223c 8 sq\u2013degs, 10%, respectively (at a source SNR of 30). Any one of\nthese ET networks would simultaneously be able to constrain the BH and IMBH masses and the IMBH spin magnitude\nto fractional accuracies of \u223c 10\u22123 , 10\u22123.5 and 10\u22123 , respectively. The amount of variation in the parameter precision\nover random choices of the source location and orientation also decreases for more complex network configurations.\nA 3 ET network is a highly optimistic assumption about a future third\u2013generation GW detector network, but our\nresults indicate that a more modest network comprising one ET and right-angle interferometers in LIGO Livingston\nand Perth can recover parameters to almost the same precision. This network would have lower associated costs\nand might therefore be more feasible. Our results should be regarded as conservative in the sense that using a lower\nlow-frequency cut-off, or assuming a different ET design, e.g., the xylophone configuration [14], could improve the\nvarious results quoted in these papers. At present we have made use of the \"ET\u2013B\" noise curve [23], but a study of\nthe potential applications of ET using both lower cut\u2013off frequencies and more optimistic designs should be carried\nout in the future.\nIf IMRIs are detected, there will be several important scientific payoffs. The detection of an IMBH as a GW source\nwould provide the first robust proof of the existence of black holes in the intermediate mass range. As discussed\nin the previous section, IMRIs are most likely to occur in globular clusters, thus IMRI observations will provide\ninformation about whether IMBHs form at all in these stellar environments, and whether they remain in the clusters\nrather than being ejected. The masses, spins and abundance of IMBHs detected as IMRIs will provide constraints on\nthe formation efficiency and evolution of globular cluster systems. In conjunction with ET observations of comparable\nmass IMBH-IMBH mergers, IMRIs could shed light on the hierarchical growth of structure, in particular to distinguish\nbetween light and heavy seed models, as described in more detail at the end of Section V.\nA further potentially exciting payoff of ET IMRI observations will be to test whether the central object in an\nIMRI is described by the Kerr metric of general relativity.

Hence, the GWs emitted during the inspiral encode a map of the spacetime. In [49, 50]\nit was shown that any stationary, axisymmetric, vacuum spacetime in relativity can be decomposed into mass, Ml ,\nand current, Sl , multipole moments. Ryan [51] went on to show that, for nearly equatorial, nearly circular inspirals,\nthese multipole moments are redundantly encoded in gravitational wave observables, namely the periapsis precession\nfrequency, the orbital plane precession frequency and the gravitational wave energy spectrum. The multipole moments\nof a Kerr black hole are completely determined by its mass, M , and spin, S1 , through the relation [50]\nl\n\nMl + iSl = M (ia) ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere a = S1 /M is the reduced spin of the black hole. Extracting three moments of the spacetime from GW emission,\nand finding them inconsistent with (15), would suffice to demonstrate that the central object is not a Kerr black hole.\nTests of this nature have been considered for observations of EMRI systems with LISA. Using a kludge model that\nincluded a non\u2013Kerr value for the quadrupole moment of the central black hole, Barack and Cutler [52] showed that\nLISA could measure the quadrupole moment, Q = \u2212S 2 /M , of the central black hole to an accuracy \u2206Q/M 3 \u223c 10\u22123 ,\nwhile simultaneously measuring the mass and spin to an accuracy \u223c 10\u22124 . In the context of IMRIs detected by\nAdvanced LIGO, it has been shown that it is possible to measure an 0(1) fractional deviation in the mass quadrupole\nmoment for typical systems [53]. ET could improve this precision by more than an order of magnitude, since ET's\nenhanced sensitivity will allow a significantly larger number of gravitational\u2013wave cycles to be observed than will be\npossible with Advanced LIGO. For instance, for a 1M\u2299 + 100M\u2299 system Advanced LIGO could measure \u223c 500 cycles\nuntil plunge. In contrast, ET with a low-frequency cut-off at 1Hz will observed up to \u223c 25000 cycles[54]. Further\nwork is required to properly quantify the ability of ET to carry out these sorts of tests on the nature of IMBHs, and\nthis should be pursued in the future.\nOur results are a first attempt to explore the precision of IMRI parameter estimation that will be achievable with the\nEinstein Telescope. Our results have been derived using a particular waveform model, which reflects the best of what\nis currently available, and combines results from both comparable mass binaries and extreme-mass-ratio inspirals.\nThese waveforms are unlikely to be accurate enough to be used in a search to recover source parameters, but they\nshould capture most of the main features of true IMRI waveforms and therefore provide a decent estimate of the\nlevel of precision that could be achieved by GW measurements. The waveform models could be improved in various\nways, by including conservative corrections, by generalizing the waveform models to consider both eccentric orbits\nand orbits inclined to the equatorial plane, and by including the leading order effects of the spin of the smaller object.\n\n\f16\n\nModel\nMean\nSt. Dev.\nq=0.9 L.Qt.\nMed.\nU.

These Tables show how the expected parameter measurement errors\ndepend on the network configuration. We explore how parameter estimation accuracies are modified for five network\nconfigurations, C1\u2013C5. These configurations are, C1: one ET at the geographic location of Virgo; C2: as configuration\nC1 plus a right\u2013angle detector at the location of LIGO Livingston; C3: as configuration C1 plus another ET at the\nlocation of LIGO Livingston; and C4: as configuration C2 plus another right\u2013angle detector in Perth. We denote the\nreference 3-ET network as configuration C5.\n\nModel\nMean\nSt. Dev.\nC1 L.Qt.\nMed.\nU. Qt.\nMean\nSt. Dev.\nC2 L.Qt.\nMed.\nU. Qt.\nMean\nSt. Dev.\nC3 L.Qt.\nMed.\nU.
