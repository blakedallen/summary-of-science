At the same time, it is notoriously difficult to obtain rigorous results in this subject. It is\na very fortunate situation that for certain integrable systems, defined on the real line, the scattering\ntheory has been completely understood. In particular, we have full control over the scattering theory\nof the Toda systems, the Calogero\u2013Moser\u2013Sutherland models, and the Ruijsenaars\u2013Schneider models\nassociated with the An root system (see e.g. [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]). Their characteristic feature is that\nthe scattering map has a factorized form. Though these integrable many-particle systems have natural\ngeneralizations to other root systems as well (see e.g. [6]), the scattering theory of the non-An -type\nmodels is far less developed than that of the An -type systems.\nIn this paper we undertake the task to understand the scattering behavior of the classical hyperbolic\nCn Sutherland model. (For background information on the Cn -type Sutherland systems see e.g. [6],\n[7], [8], [9].) Recall that the phase space of this model is the cotangent bundle of the Weyl chamber\nc := {q = (q1 , . . . , qn ) \u2208 Rn | q1 > . . . > qn > 0} and the dynamics is governed by the Hamiltonian\nn\n\n1X 2\npc +\nHCn (q, p) =\n2\nc=1\n\nX\n\n1\u2264a<b\u2264n\n\n\u0012\n\ng2\ng2\n+\nsinh2 (qa \u2212 qb ) sinh2 (qa + qb )\n\n\u0013\n\n+\n\nn\nX\nc=1\n\ng22\n,\nsinh2 (2qc )\n\n(1)\n\nwhere g and g2 are arbitrary non-zero real numbers, the so-called coupling parameters. By the\nrepulsive nature of the interaction we expect that the particles move asymptotically freely for very\nlarge positive and negative values of time t, thus it makes sense to study the scattering map that relates\nthe asymptotic phases and momenta of the past and the future. Using only elementary algebraic\ntechniques, the main goal of the paper is to show that the scattering map of the Cn -type model\nalso has a factorized form, i.e., the classical phase shifts are entirely determined by the two-particle\nprocesses and by the one-particle scatterings on the external field. The precise statement is given in\nTheorem 3. Though this result does meet our expectations, to our knowledge, its rigorous proof has\nnot appeared in the literature before.\nTo understand the scattering properties of the hyperbolic Cn Sutherland model we closely follow\nRuijsenaars' seminal work [4] on the An system. One of the upshots of his approach is that it reveals a\nnatural action-angle duality between the hyperbolic Sutherland and the rational Ruijsenaars\u2013Schneider\nmodels. Surprisingly, for root systems other than An , relatively few is known about the duality\nbetween the Sutherland and the Ruijsenaars\u2013Schneider\u2013van Diejen (RSvD) models. Even the Lax\nrepresentation of the generic RSvD dynamics is missing, except for some very special one-parameter\nfamily of Cn and BCn models obtained by the natural Z2 -folding of the original A2n\u22121 and A2n systems\n[10]. Only partial results [11] are known for the Dn root system, too. However, as a byproduct of our\nscattering theoretic analysis, we obtain a natural candidate for the Lax matrix of the two-parameter\nfamily of rational Cn RSvD models. The Lax matrix presented in Lemma 2 generalizes the known\none-parameter family of rational Lax matrices obtained by the folding procedure and it generates the\nrational Cn RSvD Hamiltonian [12] with two independent coupling parameters.\nThe paper is organized as follows. To keep the presentation self-contained, in Section 2 we collect\nthe necessary background material and fix the notational conventions. In Section 3 we present our\nresults on the scattering theory of the hyperbolic Cn Sutherland model. After the discussion part in\nSection 4, we finish the paper with an Appendix on some useful facts from linear algebra.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nPreliminaries\n\nIn this section we gather some basic facts about the hyperbolic Cn Sutherland model. We start with\na short review on some group theoretic material related to the non-compact Lie group U (n, n), then\nwe discuss the Lax representation of the Sutherland dynamics. For the details the reader may consult\n[13], [14], [6], [7], [8], [9].\n\n2.1\n\nGroup theoretic background\n\nTake an arbitrary n \u2208 N = {1, 2, . . .} and let N := 2n. With the aid of the unitary matrix\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0 1n\nC :=\n\u2208 U (N )\n1n 0\n\n(2)\n\nwe define the non-compact real reductive matrix Lie group\nU (n, n) := {y \u2208 GL(N, C) | y \u2217 Cy = C}.\n\n(3)\n\nThe fixed-point set of the Cartan involution \u0398(y) := (y \u22121 )\u2217 is the maximal compact subgroup\nU (n, n)+ := {U \u2208 U (n, n) | U is unitary } \u223c\n= U (n) \u00d7 U (n),\n\n(4)\n\nmeanwhile the submanifold U (n, n)\u2212 := {y \u2208 U (n, n) | \u0398(y) = y \u22121 } consists of the Hermitian elements\nof U (n, n). Notice that C (2) is central inside U (n, n)+ .\nThe Lie algebra of U (n, n) has the form u(n, n) = {X \u2208 gl(N, C) | X \u2217 C + CX = 0}. The natural\ntrace-pairing hX, Y i := tr(XY ) provides an invariant, non-degenerate, bilinear form on u(n, n). The\nLie algebra involution \u03b8(X) = \u2212X \u2217 corresponding to \u0398 induces the orthogonal Z2 -gradation\nu(n, n) = u(n, n)+ \u2295 u(n, n)\u2212\n\n(5)\n\nwith the eigenspaces u(n, n)\u00b1 := ker(\u03b8 \u2213 Id). The bilinear form h , i is negative definite on the subalgebra u(n, n)+ and positive definite on the complementary subspace u(n, n)\u2212 . Note that u(n, n)+\n(resp. u(n, n)\u2212 ) consists of the anti-Hermitian (resp. Hermitian) elements of u(n, n).\nNow with any real n-tuple q = (q1 , . . . , qn ) \u2208 Rn we associate the diagonal matrices\nq := diag(q1 , . . . , qn ) \u2208 gl(n, R) and Q := diag(q, \u2212q) \u2208 gl(N, R).\n\n(6)\n\nThe subset a := {Q = diag(q, \u2212q) | q \u2208 Rn } is a maximal Abelian subspace in u(n, n)\u2212 . Its centralizer\ninside U (n, n)+ is the Abelian group\nM := {diag(ei\u03c7 , ei\u03c7 ) | \u03c7 \u2208 Rn } \u2264 U (n, n)+\n\n(7)\n\nwith Lie algebra m := {diag(i\u03c7, i\u03c7) | \u03c7 \u2208 Rn } \u2264 u(n, n)+ . Notice that both a and m are realized by\ndiagonal matrices. Let a\u22a5 (resp. m\u22a5 ) denote the subspace of the off-diagonal elements of u(n, n)\u2212\n(resp. u(n, n)+ ), then we can write u(n, n)\u2212 = a \u2295 a\u22a5 and u(n, n)+ = m \u2295 m\u22a5 .\nThe subspace m\u22a5 \u2295 a\u22a5 formed by the off-diagonal elements of u(n, n) is invariant under the linear\noperator adQ , for any Q \u2208 a. Therefore the restricted operator\nfQ := adQ | \u22a5 \u22a5\nad\nm \u2295a\n3\n\n(8)\n\n\fis well-defined, with spectrum\nf Q ) = {qa \u2212 qb , \u00b1(qa + qb ), \u00b12qc | a, b, c \u2208 Nn , a 6= b},\n\u03c3(ad\n\n(9)\n\nf Q is invertible } \u2282 a.\nareg := {Q \u2208 a | ad\n\n(10)\n\nc := {Q = diag(q, \u2212q) | q = (q1 , . . . , qn ) \u2208 Rn , q1 > . . . > qn > 0}\n\n(11)\n\nwhere Nn := {1, . . . , n} \u2282 N. The regular part of a is defined by the subset\n\nSince a \\ areg is a union of finitely many hyperplanes, areg is open and dense in a. The subset\n\nis a connected component of areg , i.e., it is an open Weyl chamber. Note that the configuration space\nof the hyperbolic Cn Sutherland model (1) can be identified with c. In the following we will frequently\nuse the identification c \u223c\n= {q = (q1 , . . . , qn ) \u2208 Rn | q1 > . . . > qn > 0}.\nAs is known, the elements of u(n, n)\u2212 can be 'diagonalized' by conjugation with elements from\nU (n, n)+ . More precisely, let c\u2212 denote the closure of c, then the map\nc\u2212 \u00d7 U (n, n)+ \u220b (Q, U ) 7\u2192 U QU \u22121 \u2208 u(n, n)\u2212\n\n(12)\n\nis well-defined and onto. Moreover, the regular part of u(n, n)\u2212 ,\n(u(n, n)\u2212 )reg := {U QU \u22121 | Q \u2208 c, U \u2208 U (n, n)+ } \u2282 u(n, n)\u2212 ,\n\n(13)\n\nis an open and dense subset inside u(n, n)\u2212 , admitting the smooth bijective parametrization\nc \u00d7 (U (n, n)+ /M ) \u220b (Q, U M ) 7\u2192 U QU \u22121 \u2208 (u(n, n)\u2212 )reg .\n\n(14)\n\nThat is, the above diffeomorphism provides the identification (u(n, n)\u2212 )reg \u223c\n= c \u00d7 (U (n, n)+ /M ).\n\n2.2\n\nLax representation of the Sutherland dynamics\n\nLet E \u2208 CN denote the column vector with components Ea = 1, En+a = \u22121 (a \u2208 Nn ), and set\n\u03be := ig(EE \u2217 \u2212 1N ) + i(g \u2212 g2 )C \u2208 m\u22a5 \u2282 u(n, n)+ ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere g and g2 are arbitrary non-zero real parameters. Utilizing the Riesz\u2013Dunford functional calculus,\nto any (q, p) \u2208 T \u2217 c \u223c\n= c \u00d7 Rn \u2282 Rn \u00d7 Rn we associate the N \u00d7 N matrix\nfQ )\u03be \u2208 u(n, n)\u2212 .\nL(q, p) := P \u2212 coth(ad\n\nConsider the m-valued function \u03a6 := i diag(\u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6n , \u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6n ) with\nX\n\u0001\nsinh(qc \u2212 qa )\u22122 + sinh(qc + qa )\u22122 \u2212 g2 sinh(2qc )\u22122 ,\n\u03c6c (q, p) = \u2212g\n\n(16)\n\n(17)\n\na\u2208Nn \\{c}\n\nand define the N \u00d7 N matrix\nfQ )\u22122 \u03be \u2208 u(n, n)+ .\nB(q, p) := \u03a6(q, p) + sinh(ad\n4\n\n(18)\n\n\fAs is known, the matrix-valued functions L and B provide a Lax pair for the hyperbolic Cn Sutherland\nmodel. More precisely, along a smooth regular curve q(t) \u2208 c (t \u2208 R) the Lax equation L\u0307 = [L, B] is\nsatisfied if and only if q(t) is a solution of the hyperbolic Cn Sutherland dynamics.\nAn obvious consequence of the Lax representation of the dynamics is that the solution curves can\nbe realized as projections of certain geodesics on the Riemannian manifold U (n, n)\u2212 . Indeed, take an\narbitrary solution q(t) \u2208 c of the Sutherland dynamics and set p(t) := q\u0307(t). The differential equation\nu(t)\u22121 u\u0307(t) = B(q(t), p(t)) has a unique smooth solution u(t) \u2208 U (n, n)+ (t \u2208 R) with initial condition,\nsay, u(0) = 1N . Now for any t \u2208 R we define the positive definite matrix\ny(t) := u(t)e2Q(t) u(t)\u22121 \u2208 U (n, n)\u2212 .\n\n(19)\n\nClearly y(t) is a smooth function of t satisfying the equation y \u22121 \u1e8f + \u1e8fy \u22121 = 4uLu\u22121 . It follows that\ny(t) is a solution of the geodesic equation on U (n, n)\u2212 , i.e.,\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd y \u22121 \u1e8f + \u1e8fy \u22121\n= u(L\u0307 \u2212 [L, B])u\u22121 = 0,\n(20)\ndt\n4\nwith y(0) = e2Q(0) and y(0)\u22121 \u1e8f(0) + \u1e8f(0)y(0)\u22121 = 4L(q(0), p(0)). However, upon introducing\nf Q )\u22121 \u03be \u2208 u(n, n)\u2212 ,\nL(q, p) := cosh(adQ )\u22121 L(q, p) = P \u2212 sinh(ad\n\n(21)\n\ny(t) = eQ(0) e2tL(q(0),p(0)) eQ(0) .\n\n(22)\n\nthe unique solution of the geodesic equation with the above initial conditions is the curve\n\nComparing (19) and (22) we see that Q(t), and so the trajectory q(t), can be recovered by diagonalizing\nthe matrix flow (22). In particular, we have the spectral identification\n{e2q1 (t) , . . . , e2qn (t) , e\u22122qn (t) , . . . , e\u22122q1 (t) } = \u03c3(e2Q(0) e2tL(q(0),p(0)) ),\n\n(23)\n\nwhence the temporal asymptotics of the trajectory q(t) can be understood by analyzing the temporal\nasymptotics of the eigenvalues of the matrix flow (22). Though it is a natural matrix analytic question,\nto our knowledge the first reference containing the solution of this problem is Ruijsenaars' paper [4].\n\n3\n\nTemporal asymptotics\n\nIn this section we work out the temporal asymptotics of the hyperbolic Cn Sutherland dynamics.\nOur main guide is Ruijsenaars' result on the temporal asymptotics of the eigenvalues of exponential\nmatrix flows (22). As dictated by Theorem A2 in [4], the plan is to find the matrix entries of e2Q(0)\nin an orthonormal basis, in which L(q(0), p(0)) is diagonal with decreasing diagonal entries. Having\ncontrol over the matrix entries of e2Q(0) in this new basis, simply by computing the quotients of the\nconsecutive leading principal minors, we can determine the temporal asymptotics of the eigenvalues\nof the matrix flow.\nIn the rest of the paper we simply write L and Q in place of L(q(0), p(0)) and Q(0). Since the\ninitial conditions q(0) and p(0) = q\u0307(0) can be arbitrary, we think of L and Q as matrix-valued smooth\nfunctions over the phase space T \u2217 c \u223c\n= c \u00d7 Rn .\n\n5\n\n\f3.1\n\nAnalyzing the spectrum of L\n\nRecall that it is a crucial assumption of Theorem A2 in [4] that the spectrum of matrix L is simple.\nTo examine the spectrum of L, we set up an equation for L \u2208 u(n, n)\u2212 and A := e2Q \u2208 U (n, n)\u2212 as\nfollows. By applying the linear operator sinh(adQ ) on L (21), we get\nsinh(adQ )L = \u2212\u03be,\n\n(24)\n\nwhich entails Le2Q \u2212 e2Q L = 2eQ \u03beeQ . Now, recalling (15), we can write\n2igA + LA \u2212 AL = 2ig(eQ E)(eQ E)\u2217 + 2i(g \u2212 g2 )C.\n\n(25)\n\nNote that this equation is the complete analogue of Ruijsenaars' commutation relation (equation\n(2.4) in [4]) he analyzed to discover the remarkable action-angle duality between the hyperbolic An\nSutherland and the rational An Ruijsenaars\u2013Schneider models. If g2 = g, the right hand side of (25) is\na matrix of rank one, therefore the analysis of the equation is relatively straightforward. Notice that\nthe special case g2 = g corresponds to the Z2 -folding of the A2n\u22121 model. However, when g2 6= g, the\ninnocent looking term 2i(g \u2212 g2 )C complicates the analysis considerably.\nTo proceed further, we diagonalize L \u2208 u(n, n)\u2212 . As we saw in (12), we can write\nL = U \u013dU \u22121 = U \u013dU \u2217\n\n(26)\n\nwith some \u013d \u2208 c\u2212 and U \u2208 U (n, n)+ . Observe that \u013d is unique, having the form \u013d = diag(\u03bb, \u2212\u03bb)\nwith some \u03bb1 \u2265 . . . \u2265 \u03bbn \u2265 0, but the choice of U is not unique. However, at this point all we need is\nthe existence of the pair (\u013d, U ), the consequences of the non-uniqueness will be discussed at the end of\nthis subsection. Now from (25) we conclude that \u013d and \u01cd := U \u22121 AU \u2208 U (n, n)\u2212 satisfy the equation\n2ig\u01cd + \u013d\u01cd \u2212 \u01cd\u013d = 2ig(U \u2217 eQ E)(U \u2217 eQ E)\u2217 + 2i(g \u2212 g2 )C.\n\n(27)\n\nComputationwise it is very fortunate that the matrix \u01cd\u22121 \u2208 U (n, n)\u2212 obeys a similar equation. Indeed,\nby conjugating the above equation with C, we get\n2ig\u01cd\u22121 \u2212 \u013d\u01cd\u22121 + \u01cd\u22121 \u013d = 2ig(CU \u2217 eQ E)(CU \u2217 eQ E)\u2217 + 2i(g \u2212 g2 )C.\n\n(28)\n\nUpon introducing the purely imaginary numbers\nxc = \u2212xn+c := (2ig)\u22121 \u03bbc \u2208 iR (c \u2208 Nn ),\n\n(29)\n\nF := U \u2217 eQ E \u2208 CN ,\n\n(30)\n\n\u03b5 := 1 \u2212 g2 g\u22121 \u2208 R,\n\n(31)\n\nthe column vector\nand the real parameter\nfor the matrix entries of \u01cd and \u01cd\u22121 we obtain\n\u01cdk,l =\n\nFk F l + \u03b5Ck,l\n,\n1 + xk \u2212 xl\n\n(\u01cd\u22121 )k,l =\n\n(CF )k (CF )l + \u03b5Ck,l\n,\n1 \u2212 xk + xl\n\n(32)\n\nfor any k, l \u2208 NN . Note that the relations\nN\nX\nFk F j + \u03b5Ck,j (CF )j (CF )l + \u03b5Cj,l\n= \u03b4k,l\n1 + xk \u2212 xj\n1 \u2212 xj + xl\nj=1\n\n6\n\n(33)\n\n\fobviously follow from (32).\nHaving equipped with the above formulae, we are able to analyze the spectrum of L and the\nproperties of column vector F . For convenience, we introduce the notations\nfc := Fc ,\n\nzc := fc hc\n\nhc := Fn+c ,\n\n(c \u2208 Nn ).\n\n(34)\n\nLemma 1. If the non-zero coupling parameters g and g2 satisfy g2 6= 2g, then the components of the\ncolumn vector F are non-zero and L is a regular element of u(n, n)\u2212 .\nProof. We only show that the components of F are non-zero. Proving by contraposition, suppose\nthat zc = 0 for some c \u2208 Nn . With k = l = c, from (33) we get the quadratic relation \u03b52 = (1 + 2xc )2 ,\ni.e., \u03b5 = \u00b1(1 + 2xc ). By comparing the real parts we obtain \u03b5 = \u00b11, which contradicts our assumption\non the coupling parameters. Along the same line, by appropriately specializing the indices in equation\n(33), the regularity of L also follows.\n\u0004\nRemark. Henceforth we assume that the parameters g and g2 satisfy the additional technical condition g2 6= 2g. Notice, however, that it does not restrict the values of the physically relevant positive\ncoupling constants g2 and g22 , since the pairs (g, g2 ) and (g, \u2212g2 ) generate the same couplings in the\nmodel (1). In principle, without loss of generality, we could have imposed the condition gg2 < 0 at\nthe outset, thereby automatically excluding the case g2 = 2g.\nTo conclude this subsection we wish to point out that the construction of zc (34) results in a\nwell-defined smooth function on the phase space T \u2217 c. As we saw in (14), by the regularity of L, the\nnon-uniqueness of the diagonalizing matrix U \u2208 U (n, n)+ defined in (26) is controlled entirely by the\ncentralizer subgroup M (7). Namely, the only freedom in the choice of U can be characterized by the\ntransformations\nU 7\u2192 U diag(ei\u03c7 , ei\u03c7 ),\n(35)\ngenerated by some \u03c7 \u2208 Rn . Now observe that the components fc and hc (34) of the column vector F\n(30) transform as\n(36)\nfc 7\u2192 e\u2212i\u03c7c fc and hc 7\u2192 e\u2212i\u03c7c hc ,\nhence zc = fc hc is independent of the choice of the representative U . It means that to each L = L(q, p)\nwe can associate the non-zero complex numbers zc = zc (q, p) (c \u2208 Nn ) in a unique and well-defined\nmanner. To show that their dependence on the phase space variables (q, p) is smooth, we notice that\nby choosing appropriate smooth local sections of the (smooth) fiber bundle\nc \u00d7 U (n, n)+ \u0589 c \u00d7 (U (n, n)+ /M ) \u223c\n= (u(n, n)\u2212 )reg ,\n\n(37)\n\nwe can work with representatives U \u2208 U (n, n)+ depending smoothly on the phase space variables in\na small neighborhood of any given (q, p) \u2208 T \u2217 c. Thus, zc is smooth around any (q, p), proving its\nsmoothness over the whole phase space.\n\n3.2\n\nThe structure of \u01cd\n\nIn this subsection we proceed with a detailed analysis on the structure of matrix \u01cd. To this end,\nwe make use of Jacobi's theorem in linear algebra, i.e., we exploit some non-trivial relations between\ncertain minors of matrices \u01cd and B\u030c := (\u01cd\u22121 )T . For convenience, in Appendix A we provide a brief\naccount on the relevant theorems from linear algebra.\n\n7\n\n\fIn the following we keep the index c \u2208 Nn fixed and apply Jacobi's theorem on appropriate minors\nof \u01cd and B\u030c. Since det(A) = det(e2Q ) = 1, let us keep in mind that det(\u01cd) = 1 also holds. To make\nthe presentation shorter we introduce the notations\nDc :=\n\nn\nY\n\n2\n\n|hd |\n\nd=1\n(d6=c)\n\nn\nY\n\na,b=1\n(c6=a6=b6=c)\n\nxa \u2212 xb\n1 + xa \u2212 xb\n\nand \u03c9c :=\n\nn\nY\n\na=1\n(a6=c)\n\n(xc \u2212 xa )(xc + xa )\n.\n(1 + xc \u2212 xa )(1 + xc + xa )\n\n(38)\n\nClearly Dc \u2208 R \\ {0} and \u03c9c \u2208 C \\ {0}. Note also that in the equations below the matrices ek,l stand\nfor the elementary matrices, i.e., their entries are defined as (ek,l )k\u2032 ,l\u2032 = \u03b4k,k\u2032 \u03b4l,l\u2032 .\nAs a first application of Jacobi's theorem, we can write\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 ***\nc\n*** n\nn + 1 * * * n + c * * * 2n\nB\u030c\n= \u2212\u01cd\n.\n(39)\n1 *** n + c *** n\nn + 1 ***\nc\n* * * 2n\nLet R and S denote the n \u00d7 n submatrices corresponding to the above minors on the left and on the\nright, respectively. Upon introducing the Cauchy-type n \u00d7 n matrix \u03a8 with entries\n\u03a8a,b :=\n\nha hb\nha fc\nif b 6= c, and \u03a8a,c :=\n,\n1 + xa \u2212 xb\n1 + xa \u2212 xn+c\n\n(40)\n\nfrom (32) we see that\nR = \u03a8 + \u03b5(1 + 2xc )\u22121 ec,c ,\n\n(41)\n\nmeanwhile the entries of S can be identified as Sa,b = Ra,b (a, b \u2208 Nn ). Therefore, equation (39) can\nbe cast into the particularly simple form\ndet(R) + det(R) = 0.\n\n(42)\n\nSince R is a rank one perturbation of \u03a8, the determinant formula (A.6) spells out as\ndet(R) = det(\u03a8) + \u03b5(1 + 2xc )\u22121 Cc,c,\n\n(43)\n\nwhere Cc,c is the cofactor of \u03a8 associated with entry \u03a8c,c . Since \u03a8 is of Cauchy-type, we get\ndet(\u03a8) = (1 + 2xc )\u22121 Dc \u03c9c zc\n\nand Cc,c = Dc .\n\n(44)\n\nPlugging these formulae into (42), for zc we obtain the linear relation\n(1 \u2212 2xc )\u03c9c zc + (1 + 2xc )\u03c9 c z c + 2\u03b5 = 0.\n\n(45)\n\nNotice that this single equation does not determine uniquely the complex quantity zc .\nTo get an independent relation for zc , we turn to Jacobi's theorem, again. Namely, we can write\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\nn + 1 * * * n[\n+ c * * * 2n\n1 *** n n + c\n= \u01cd\n,\n(46)\nB\u030c\n1 *** n n + c\nn + 1 * * * n[\n+ c * * * 2n\nwhere the symbol n[\n+ c means that the indicated row (and column) is deleted in the minor on the right\nhand side. That is, on the left we have a principal minor of B\u030c of size n + 1, and the principal minor\nof \u01cd on the right has size n \u2212 1. Let X and Y denote the submatrices corresponding to these minors,\n8\n\n\frespectively, then we have det(X) = det(Y ). Since Y is of Cauchy-type, the relation det(Y ) = Dc\nimmediately follows. On the other hand, the computation of det(X) requires a longer preparation.\nTo this end, we introduce the Cauchy-type (n + 1) \u00d7 (n + 1) matrix \u03a6 with entries\n\u03a6a,b :=\n\nha hb\nha fc\nf c hb\n, \u03a6a,n+1 :=\n, \u03a6n+1,n+1 := |fc |2 ,\n, \u03a6n+1,b :=\n1 + xa \u2212 xb\n1 + xa \u2212 xn+c\n1 + xn+c \u2212 xb\n\n(47)\n\nwhere a, b \u2208 Nn . Recalling (32), we see that\nX = \u03a6 + \u03b5(1 + 2xc )\u22121 ec,n+1 + \u03b5(1 \u2212 2xc )\u22121 en+1,c ,\ni.e., X is a rank two perturbation of \u03a6. Therefore, the determinant formula (A.8) yields\n\u0012\n\u0013\nCc,n+1\n|Cc,n+1 |2 \u2212 Cc,c Cn+1,n+1\nC c,n+1\ndet(X) = det(\u03a6) + \u03b5\n+\n,\n+ \u03b52\n1 + 2xc 1 \u2212 2xc\n(1 \u2212 4x2c ) det(\u03a6)\n\n(48)\n\n(49)\n\nwhere the Ck,l 's now denote the cofactors of \u03a6. Using the special Cauchy-type form of \u03a6, we obtain\ndet(\u03a6) = \u22124x2c (1 \u2212 4x2c )\u22121 Dc |\u03c9c zc |2 ,\n\nCc,n+1 = \u2212(1 \u2212 2xc )\u22121 Dc \u03c9 c z c ,\n\n(50)\n\ntogether with the relations\nCc,c = Dc |fc |2\n\nn\nY\n\na=1\n(a6=c)\n\nCn+1,n+1 = Dc |hc |2\n\n(xc + xa )(\u2212xc \u2212 xa )\n,\n(1 + xc + xa )(1 \u2212 xc \u2212 xa )\nn\nY\n\na=1\n(a6=c)\n\n(xc \u2212 xa )(\u2212xc + xa )\n.\n(1 + xc \u2212 xa )(1 \u2212 xc + xa )\n\n(51)\n\n(52)\n\nIt immediately follows that the determinant of X has the form\n\u0001\ndet(X) = \u2212(1 \u2212 4x2c )\u22121 Dc 4x2c |\u03c9c zc |2 + \u03b5(\u03c9c zc + \u03c9c z c ) + \u03b52 .\n\n(53)\n\n4x2c |\u03c9c zc |2 + \u03b5(\u03c9c zc + \u03c9 c z c ) + \u03b52 + 1 \u2212 4x2c = 0.\n\n(54)\n\nFinally, by putting these formulae together, we end up with the quadratic equation\n\nNext, by solving equations (45) and (54) for zc , we find the following two solutions\n\u0013 n \u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\u00b1\u03b5 Y\n1\n1+\n.\nzc = \u00b1 1 +\n1+\n2xc\nxc \u2212 xa\nxc + xa\n\n(55)\n\na=1\n(a6=c)\n\nIn order to select the right one, we proceed as follows. In the phase space region where the particles\nare far from each other, i.e., q1 \u226b . . . \u226b qn \u226b 0, moving with high relative momenta, i.e., p1 \u226b . . . \u226b\npn \u226b 0, the matrix L (21) is almost diagonal, therefore the diagonalizing matrix U (26) is also nearly\ndiagonal. Recalling equations (30) and (34), we see that in the given phase space region the value of\nzc is very close to \u22121. Since zc is a smooth function over the connected phase space T \u2217 c, by invoking\na standard continuity argument, we conclude that\n\u0012\n\u0013 n \u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\nig2 Y\n2ig\n2ig\nzc = \u2212 1 +\n1+\n.\n(56)\n1+\n\u03bbc a=1\n\u03bbc \u2212 \u03bba\n\u03bbc + \u03bba\n(a6=c)\n\n9\n\n\fHaving determined zc , we can find the form of the components fc and hc (34), too. As we discussed\nat the end of the previous subsection, by the non-uniqueness of U (26), the non-zero complex quantities\nfc and hc are determined only up to a common phase factor (36). Therefore, purely for convenience,\nwe may and shall assume that fc > 0 for any c \u2208 Nn . So, we can write\n1\n\n1\n\nand hc = e\u2212\u03b8c z c |zc |\u2212 2\n\nfc = e\u03b8c |zc | 2\n\n(57)\n\nwith some \u03b8c \u2208 R. Combining this parametrization with (32), we obtain the following description of\nthe matrix \u01cd.\nLemma 2. With the aid of the \u03bb-dependent functions zc (56), the matrix entries of \u01cd take the form\n\n\u01cda,n+b = \u01cdn+b,a\n\n2ig\n,\n2ig + \u03bba \u2212 \u03bbb\n\nz a zb\n\n2ig\n,\n2ig\n\u2212\n\u03bba + \u03bbb\n|za zb |\n1\ni(g \u2212 g2 )\n2ig\n= e\u03b8a \u2212\u03b8b zb |za zb\u22121 | 2\n+\n\u03b4a,b ,\n2ig + \u03bba + \u03bbb\nig + \u03bba\n1\n\n\u01cda,b = e\u03b8a +\u03b8b |za zb | 2\n\n\u01cdn+a,n+b = e\u2212\u03b8a \u2212\u03b8b\n\n1\n2\n\n(58)\n(59)\n\nwhere a, b \u2208 Nn .\nRemark. Due to the presence of the g2 -dependent second term on the right-hand side of equation\n(59), the matrix \u01cd can be seen as a Cn -type non-trivial deformation of the usual Cauchy matrices.\nSpelling out the relation det(\u01cd) = 1, the resulting Cauchy-type determinant formula might be of\ninterest in other branches of mathematics and physics as well.\n\n3.3\n\nAsymptotic phases and momenta\n\nNow let q(t) = (q1 (t), . . . , qn (t)) \u2208 c be an arbitrary solution of the hyperbolic Cn Sutherland dynamics,\nthen by (23) we can write\n{e2q1 (t) , . . . , e2qn (t) , e\u22122qn (t) , . . . , e\u22122q1 (t) } = \u03c3(\u01cde2t\u013d ),\n\n(60)\n\nwhere both L and A are computed at time t = 0. Since the diagonal entries of \u013d = diag(\u03bb, \u2212\u03bb) are\nnot in decreasing order, we conjugate it by the unitary N \u00d7 N matrix W := diag(1n , Rn ), where Rn\nis the unitary n \u00d7 n matrix with entries (Rn )a,b := \u03b4a+b,n+1 (a, b \u2208 Nn ). Upon setting\nL\u0302 := W \u013dW \u22121\n\nand\n\n\u00c2 := W \u01cdW \u22121 ,\n\n(61)\n\nwe see that the diagonal entries of L\u0302 = diag(\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn , \u2212\u03bbn , . . . , \u2212\u03bb1 ) are decreasing, and for any\na, b \u2208 Nn we have\n(62)\n\u00c2a,b = \u01cda,b = fa (1 + xa \u2212 xb )\u22121 f b .\nAt this point Ruijsenaars' theorem [4] on the temporal asymptotics of exponential matrix flows is\ndirectly applicable. Recalling (60), for any c \u2208 Nn we obtain the asymptotic relation\ne2qc (t) \u223c mc e2t\u03bbc = eln(mc )+2t\u03bbc\n\n(t \u2192 \u221e),\n\n(63)\n\nwhere the mc 's stand for the quotients of the consecutive leading principal minors of \u00c2.

Under\ncertain technical conditions the classical repulsive particle systems are Liouville integrable, having only\nscattering states. Indeed, in general the asymptotic momenta provide sufficiently many independent\nfirst integrals in involution. However, the asymptotic momenta of the hyperbolic Cn Sutherland model\n\u2212\nsatisfy also the peculiar algebraic conditions p+\nc = \u2212pc (c \u2208 Nn ). Following Ruijsenaars' terminology\n[5], this distinguishing feature gives grounds for calling the Cn -type model a pure soliton system.\nAs in the An -type models, we expect that this stronger notion of integrability is responsible for the\nfactorized form of the scattering map.\n11\n\n\fWe find it interesting that the application of elementary linear algebraic techniques succeeds in\nrevealing the scattering behavior of the Cn model. Since the hyperbolic BCn Sutherland model with\nthree independent coupling constants is also closely tied with the matrix Lie group U (n, n) (see [9]),\nwe believe that the algebraic machinery presented in this paper can be extended to understand the\nscattering properties of the BCn model, too. Nevertheless, a complete classification of the pure soliton\nsystems associated with the BCn root system appears to be a more challenging analytic problem.\nFor further motivation we mention that these finite dimensional many-particle systems are closely\nconnected with integrable field theories. For example, it is well-known that the family of An -type\nRuijsenaars\u2013Schneider models describe the soliton solutions of the sine-Gordon equation (see e.g. [15],\n[16]). Following [17], it is also natural to speculate on the mathematically adequate description of the\nrelationship between the scattering theory of the BCn -type particle systems and the soliton dynamics\nof the boundary sine-Gordon models, at both the classical and the quantum level. We wish to come\nback to these issues in later publications.\nTo explore the scattering properties of the Cn model we adapted Ruijsenaars' approach [4] to the\nCn root system. Thus, it is quite natural that the matrix \u01cd appearing in Lemma 2 can be interpreted\nas the Lax matrix of the rational Cn RSvD model. Recall that matrix \u01cd depends on 2n real parameters\n\u03bb = (\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn ) and \u03b8 = (\u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8n ) with \u03bb1 > . . . > \u03bbn > 0. Regarding the parameters \u03bbc and \u03b8c as\ncanonically conjugated positions and momenta, the natural Hamiltonian associated with the matrix\n\u01cd takes the form\n1\ntr(\u01cd + \u01cd\u22121 )\n4\n\u0012\n\u00131 n \u0012\n\u0013 12 \u0012\n\u0013 12\nn\nX\n4g2\n4g2\ng22 2 Y\n.\n1+\n1+\ncosh(2\u03b8c ) 1 + 2\n=\n\u03bbc\n(\u03bbc \u2212 \u03bba )2\n(\u03bbc + \u03bba )2\na=1\nc=1\n\nH(\u03bb, \u03b8) =\n\n(71)\n\n(a6=c)\n\nNow let us observe that, up to an irrelevant additive constant, this function can be identified with the\nrational limit of van Diejen's Hamiltonian (see equation (6) in [12]) with two independent coupling\nparameters. To prove the canonicity of \u03bbc and \u03b8c and to show the duality between the hyperbolic\nCn Sutherland and the rational Cn RSvD models, one could imitate Ruijsenaars' original work [4] on\nthe systems of type An . However, for the An -type models it has been shown recently [18] that the\nsymplectic reduction framework provides the most efficient way to establish the duality relation. For\ncompleteness, we now briefly outline the reduction picture underlying the duality of the Cn models.\nThe compact Lie group U (n, n)+ naturally acts on the manifold U (n, n)\u2212 by conjugations. The lift of\nthis action to the cotangent bundle T \u2217 U (n, n)\u2212 is Hamiltonian, admitting an equivariant momentum\nmap J : T \u2217 U (n, n)\u2212 \u2192 u(n, n)\u2217+ \u223c\n= u(n, n)+ . In the reduction picture our functional equation (25)\ncorresponds to the momentum map constraint J = \u03be with the special choice \u03be (15). Solving this\nconstraint in a gauge in which A is diagonal, the outcome of the reduction procedure is the usual phase\nspace of the Sutherland model (see e.g. [6], [7], [8]), and the Sutherland dynamics (1) is induced by the\nHamiltonian H = tr(L2 )/4. Note, however, that in Section 3 we solved the momentum map constraint\nin a gauge in which L is diagonal. As a result, the reduced phase space can be parametrized by the \u03bbc 's\nand the \u03b8c 's, and the dynamics of our interest (71) is induced by the Hamiltonian H = tr(A + A\u22121 )/4.\nTherefore, by using two different gauges, one in which A is diagonal, and one in which L is diagonal, we\nobtain two different realizations of the reduced phase space T \u2217 U (n, n)\u2212 //\u03be U (n, n)+ , whence a natural\nsymplectomorphism between the phase spaces of the hyperbolic Cn Sutherland and the rational Cn\nRSvD models comes for free. The details, together with the generalization to the BCn systems, will\nbe published elsewhere.\n12\n\n\fNotice that the action-angle duality between the Sutherland and the RSvD models has important consequences from the perspective of scattering theory, too. Based on the duality relation the\nscattering theory of the rational BCn RSvD models could also be understood. Moreover, as in the\nAn -type models, the duality could greatly simplify the verification of the simplecticity of the M\u00f8ller\nwave transformations both for the Sutherland and the RSvD models, thereby the understanding of\ntheir scattering theory would be complete.\n\nA\n\nAppendix\n\nIn this appendix we summarize some linear algebraic facts used throughout the paper. The proofs\nand further details can be found e.g. in [19].\nFor an n \u00d7 n matrix X, let\n\u0013\n\u0012\nk1 k2 * * * kp\n(A.1)\nX\nl1 l2 * * * lp\ndenote the minor determinant of the p \u00d7 p submatrix of X lying on the intersection of rows k1 , k2 , . . .,\nkp with columns l1 , l2 , . . ., lp . Jacobi's theorem claims that there are simple relationships between the\nminors of X and the minors of its inverse, as described below.\nTheorem A1. Let X be an invertible n \u00d7 n matrix, Y := (X \u22121 )T , and choose a permutation\n\u0013\n\u0012\nk1 k2 * * * kn\n\u2208 SN\n(A.2)\n\u03c3=\nl1 l2 * * * ln\nof the pairwise distinct indices k1 , k2 , . . . , kn \u2208 Nn . Then for any p \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , n} we have\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\nsgn(\u03c3)\nkp+1 kp+2 * * * kn\nk1 k2 * * * kp\n,\nX\n=\nY\nlp+1 lp+2 * * * ln\nl1 l2 * * * lp\ndet(X)\n\n(A.3)\n\nwhere sgn(\u03c3) denotes the sign of permutation \u03c3.\nIn this paper we frequently encounter Cauchy matrices and their perturbations. Recall that for the\ndeterminants of the Cauchy matrices we have\n\u0012\n\u0013 Q\n(\u03bek \u2212 \u03bel )(\u03b7l \u2212 \u03b7k )\n1\nQ\n,\n(A.4)\ndet\n= k<l\n1 + \u03bek \u2212 \u03b7l\nk,l (1 + \u03bek \u2212 \u03b7l )\n\nwhere the \u03bek 's and the \u03b7l 's are arbitrary complex numbers. The key formula that allows us to compute\neffectively the determinants of perturbed matrices is given in the following\nTheorem A2. Let X \u2208 Cn\u00d7n be an invertible matrix and V, W \u2208 Cn\u00d7k be arbitrary matrices, then\nwe have\ndet(X + V W \u2217 ) = det(X) det(1k + W \u2217 X \u22121 V ).\n(A.5)\n\nIn particular, if X is perturbed by a multiple of the elementary matrix ea,b , then we can write\ndet(X + \u03b1ea,b ) = det(X) + \u03b1Ca,b ,\n\n13\n\n(A.6)\n\n\fwhere Ca,b is the cofactor of X associated with entry Xa,b , i.e., it is (\u22121)a+b times the (n \u2212 1) \u00d7 (n \u2212 1)\nminor obtained by deleting the ath row and the bth column of X. For analogue rank two perturbations\nwe have\ndet(X + \u03b1ea,b + \u03b2ec,d ) = det(X) + \u03b1Ca,b + \u03b2Cc,d + \u03b1\u03b2(Ca,b Cc,d \u2212 Ca,d Cc,b ) det(X)\u22121 .\n\n(A.7)\n\nFinally, if X is an invertible Hermitian matrix, the above formula simplifies to\ndet(X + \u03b1ea,b + \u03b1eb,a ) = det(X) + \u03b1Ca,b + \u03b1C a,b + |\u03b1|2 (|Ca,b |2 \u2212 Ca,a Cb,b ) det(X)\u22121 .\n\n(A.8)\n\nSince any quadratic submatrix of a Cauchy matrix is Cauchy again, the above determinant formulae\noffer a relatively painless way to compute the determinants of perturbed Cauchy matrices.\nAcknowledgments.
