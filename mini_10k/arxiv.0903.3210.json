We also studied the high-resolution grating\nspectrum of SAX J1808.4-3658, and found several absorption edges and Oxygen absorption lines with whom we infer, in a model independent way, the interstellar column\ndensities of several elements in the direction of SAX J1808.4-3658.\nKey words: stars: pulsars: general - pulsar: individual: SAX J1808.4-3658\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar (AMXP) SAX\nJ1808.4\u20133658 (J1808 from now on) was the first X-ray binary found to pulsate in the millisecond range, with a\nspin period of 2.5 ms (Wijnands & van der Klis 1998)). It\nhas been observed in outburst 6 times, roughly every 2.5\nyears since 1996. During the outburst, the magnetic field is\nthought to channel part of the disc material onto the neutron star magnetic poles. The radiation emitted from the\nimpact region (hot spot) and/or a slab of shocked material above it is then modulated at the neutron star spin\nperiod. This radiation is observed as pulsed emission that\nadds to the unpulsed emission coming from the accretion\ndisc. A possible comptonizing medium surrounding the impact region can upscatter part of the radiation to higher\nenergies (Poutanen & Gierli\u0144ski 2003). The pulsations and\nthe X-ray spectrum were observed during previous outbursts by RXTE and a first study of the 1998 outburst was\nperformed using those data (Poutanen & Gierli\u0144ski 2003,\nIbragimov & Poutanen 2008). J1808 was never observed below 2 keV during an outburst (except in the 2000 and 2005\noutbursts at very low luminosity levels, see Wijnands 2003\nand Campana et al. 2008). This energy range is important\nto understand the pulse formation mechanism, because it is\n\n\u22c6\n\nemail: a.patruno@uva.nl\n\nhere that both the hot spot and the accretion disc thermal\nemissions are expected to peak. Also, many absorption lines\nfrom the interstellar medium are expected in this energy\nrange. These lines are important to definitively determine\nthe interstellar column density toward the source. Broadband spectral analyses of this XMM observation were reported by Papitto et al. (2009) and Cackett et al. (2009),\nwho both focused on the study of the iron line emission at\n6\u20137 keV. Here we present the first simultaneous spectral and\ntiming analysis of the pulsations of J1808 as observed with\nXMM-Newton during the 2008 outburst, with a particular\nattention to the lower energy range (< 2 keV).\n\n2\n\nX-RAY OBSERVATION\n\nJ1808 was observed in outburst with XMM\u2013Newton on 2008\nOctober 1st (MJD 54740), for 63 ks of on\u2013source exposure\ntime. At the time of this observation, J1808 was at the\nbeginning of the exponential decay stage of the outburst,\nwith a relatively high flux level (see Hartman et al. 2009\nfor a description of the overall outburst lightcurve). The\nXMM\u2013Newton Observatory (Jansen et al. 2001) includes\nthree 1500 cm2 X-ray telescopes with the European Photon\nImaging Camera (EPIC), and a Reflecting Grating Spectrometer (RGS; den Herder et al. 2001). An Optical Monitor is also present (Mason et al. 2001). It is used to follow optical counterparts and will not be considered in this\n\n\f2\n\nPatruno et al.\nGlobal pulse profile\nfundamental\n2nd harmonic\n\n2.5\n\n1.16\n1.14\nNormalized intensity\n\nFractional amplitude [% rms]\n\n3\n\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n\n1.12\n1.1\n1.08\n1.06\n1.04\n1.02\n1\n\n0\n\n0.98\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n8\nEnergy [keV]\n\n10\n\n12\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n1.5\nPulse phase [cycle]\n\n2\n\nFigure 1.

Vertical bars indicate 1 \u03c3 errors in amplitude and horizontal bars the energy range. The black squares\nare the fractional amplitudes of the global profile, with the rms of the fundamental and second harmonic added in quadrature. The\npulsed fraction is much lower below \u2248 2 keV, reaching a minimum value of \u2248 0.4% rms in the 0.3-1 keV energy range. Right panel:\npulse profiles in four different energy bands (blue asterisks 0.3\u20132 keV, red squares: 2\u20133.5 keV, green circles: 3.5\u20134.5 keV, black triangles\n4.5\u201312 keV). The profiles are double peaked, with the strength of the second harmonic increasing at higher energies. Two cycles are\nplotted, with profiles normalized to the maximum intensity and shifted by arbitrary amounts. The bottom profile corresponds to the low\nenergies (0.3-2 keV) and its fractional amplitude is considerably reduced (although still significantly detected).\n\nwork. The EPIC camera is composed of two MOS CCDs\n(Turner et al. 2001) and a pn CCD (Str\u00fcder et al. 2001).\nEach EPIC camera has a fixed, mode dependent frame readout frequency, producing event lists in the 0.1-12 keV energy\nrange. The RGS, is composed of a double array of gratings\nand produces high resolution spectra in the 0.33 to 2.5 keV\nenergy range.\n\nData have been processed using SAS version 8.0.1, and\nwe have employed the most recent calibration files (CCF)\navailable at the time the reduction was performed (February\n2009). Standard data screening criteria were applied in the\nextraction of scientific products. After removing solar flares\nand telemetry dropouts the net pn exposure time is 41 ks.\nThe central CCD of MOS1 was operated in full frame\nmode with thin filters, and is heavily piled\u2013up. For this\nreason we do not consider the MOS1 data any further. The\nMOS2 was operated in timing window mode, and is also excluded from our analysis since the 1.5 ms time resolution is\ninsufficient to study the pulsations, and its spectral capabilities for very bright sources are not as much calibrated as the\npn camera. The pn camera was operating in timing mode\n(with a thin filter),in order to reduce pile\u2013up and allow\nthe high precision timing analysis required for an accreting\nmillisecond X-ray pulsar (AMXP). We extracted the source\nphotons from the pn with RAWX coordinates 26-49. The\nbackground is obtained from a region of the same size, at\nRAWX 2-25. Only photons with PATTERN6 4 were used.\nThe extracted spectrum was rebinned before fitting to obtain at least 100 counts per bin and the pn energy resolution\nwas not oversampled by more than a factor three. We also\nextracted first and second order RGS1 and RGS2 spectra,\nusing the standard procedure reported in the XMM\u2013Newton\nanalysis manual, and again we ensured to have at least 100\ncounts per spectral bin in any RGS spectrum.\n\n3\n\nTIMING ANALYSIS\n\nWe have first corrected the event times to the barycenter of the Solar System (using the SAS tool barycen, and\nthe optical position given in Hartman et al. 2008) and then\nwe applied the 2008 outburst timing solution published in\nHartman et al. (2009) in order to predict the phases of\neach photon detected and reconstruct the pulse profiles (see\nPatruno et al. 2009 for a detailed explanation of the timing technique). For the timing analysis we use events in the\n0.3\u201312 keV energy range. The pulse profiles are built by folding data segments of length \u223c 3500 s for the pulse phase\nanalysis. This length is chosen to guarantee sufficiently high\nsignal-to-noise profiles even if the pulsed fractions are small.\nThe pulses are then decomposed by fitting two harmonics\nwith frequency fixed at the pulse frequency (fundamental,\n\u03bd) and twice the pulse frequency (second harmonic, 2\u03bd) plus\na constant representing the non-pulsed emission.\nWe did not attempt to calculate a new timing solution since the precision of the solution achievable with the\nshort observation baseline of XMM is at least an order of\nmagnitude lower than what was obtained with the RXTE\ndata (Hartman et al. 2009). The short baseline of the observation is also insufficient to model the timing noise that\naffects the pulse phases and that was extensively discussed\nin Hartman et al. (2008, 2009) for J1808. If timing noise is\npresent, a systematic error is introduced in the determination of the pulse phases and spin frequency (Patruno et al.\n2009).\nTherefore we decided to subtract the solution reported\nin Hartman et al. (2009) and obtain the phase residuals with\nrespect to that constant pulse frequency plus Keplerian circular orbit model. The pulse phase residuals of the fundamental drift by \u2248 0.1 cycles during the observation. We also\nfound a correlation between these pulse phase residuals and\nthe 0.3-12 keV X-ray flux. We fitted the data with a linear\n\n\f4\n\nSPECTRAL ANALYSIS\n\nWe performed spectral analysis using the EPIC-pn spectrum\n(extracted as reported in \u00a7 2) in the 0.6\u201312 keV energy range,\nand the RGS1 and RGS2 in the 0.4\u20131.8 keV energy range for\nthe first order, and 0.7\u20131.8 keV for the second order. XSPEC\nversion 11.3 was used for the spectral analysis.\nTo account for relative flux calibration uncertainties between different instruments, we fitted a multiplicative constant with the model, allowing for up to 10% relative calibration flux scaling between EPIC-pn and RGS1 . The relative\noffsets between the instruments are found to be less than\n4% in all our fits. Furthermore, we included a 1.5% systematic to the errors of each spectral bin (using the relative\nXSPEC tool) to take into account the calibration inaccuracies\nof each single instrument used2 . We first used solar abundances from Anders & Grevesse (1989) and cross-sections\nfrom Balucinska-Church & McCammon (1992) for the photoelectric absorption. We tried an absorbed power-law plus\na multi temperature disc and a single temperature blackbody model (phabs\u2217(diskbb + bbody + powerlaw)) as suggested in Cackett et al. (2009) and Papitto et al. (2009).\nThe \u03c72\u03bd = 5 was unacceptable, mainly because of unmodelled features in the data points between 0.3\u20132 keV and 6\u2013\n7 keV.\nThe 6-7 keV energy range is where fluorescence lines\nof Fe are expected (George & Fabian 1991). Following\nCackett et al. (2009) and Papitto et al. (2009) who claimed\nthe detection of a broad iron K\u03b1 line in this energy range, we\nfitted this feature with a diskline model (see Tab. 1).

The\npower-law flux dominates over the other spectral components.\n\nrefer to Cackett et al. (2009) and Papitto et al. (2009) for\ndiscussion of this broad iron line. To model the 0.3\u20132 keV\nfeatures, we first tried several photoelectric cross-sections,\nand different element abundances. The residuals are not very\nsensitive to the photoelectric cross-section parameters, while\nthey strongly depend on the assumed abundances. The best\nfit model, however not yet satisfactorily, was found using\nthe Balucinska-Church & McCammon (1992) cross-sections,\nand the Wilms et al. (2000) abundances. The stronger low\nenergy features in the residuals were coming from absorption\nand emission features close to the oxygen K-edge (OK -edge)\nat 0.543 keV. We decided to model only the continuum and\nthe iron K\u03b1 line as a first step, ignoring the data between\n0.5-0.6 keV. This energy range and the single features it contains were then investigated separately by using the RGS\ndata (see \u00a7 4.1, and Table 1 for the continuum and Fe line\nspectral results).\nThe two weak features at 1.8 keV and 2.2 keV are known\nto be due to the instrumental Si and Au K edges, not yet\nperfectly calibrated, especially when dealing with timing\nmode observations (see the EPIC calibration report in the\nfootnote). We do not find evidence of a 0.871 keV O VII edge\n(reported in Papitto et al. 2009), and no other significant\nedges are detected in the 0.8-1 keV range.\nAfter removing the O-Si-Au edges (0.5-0.6 and 1.62.3 keV), we obtain \u03c72\u03bd = 1.41 (4051 dof). Given the high\nquality X-ray spectrum, the relatively high value of \u03c72\u03bd =\n1.41 is very likely due to inter-calibration problems between\nthe pn and the RGS spectra, and to the calibration uncertainties of each camera which emerge when observing bright\nsources. In fact, when using only the pn spectrum, we obtain a statistically acceptable fit with a \u03c72\u03bd = 0.95 for 235\ndof, with the same spectral parameters as reported in Tab. 1.\nThe same model applied to the RGS alone gives a \u03c72\u03bd = 1.1.\nTherefore we accept the \u03c72\u03bd = 1.41 and do not further complicate the spectral model.\n4.1\n\n1\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\nPower\u2212law\n\u03bdF\u03bd [keV*(keV cm\u22122 s\u22121/keV)]\n\nrelation that gives a \u03c72 of 11.4 for 10 degrees of freedom,\nand a slope of (9.9 \u00b1 1.2) \u00d7 10\u22124 cycle/ct/s (we quote the 1\u03c3\nerror).\nThe second harmonic is significantly detected in only\n\u2248 1/3 of the profiles, where a detection is defined as a ratio\nbetween the pulse amplitude and its statistical error larger\nthan 3. When not detected, the second harmonic fractional\namplitude upper limit was between 0.4 and 0.6% rms at the\n98% confidence level. No correlation between pulse phases\nand flux was found for the second harmonic.\nTo increase the signal to noise and calculate the harmonic content of the pulsations in the whole energy band,\nwe folded the entire 41 ks data into one single pulse profile.\nThe fractional rms amplitude of fundamental and second\nharmonic in the 0.3-12 keV energy band is 0.98(2)% rms\nand 0.33(3)% rms respectively (1\u03c3 uncertainties).\nWe then repeated the procedure by dividing the observations in 9 energy bands between 0.3 and 12 keV. The fractional amplitude of the pulse profile increases from 0.3 up\nto 3 keV, and then it remains constant within the errors up\nto 12 keV (Fig 1). The fundamental tracks the behaviour of\nthe total pulse profile. The second harmonic increases monotonically in the energy range considered. At energies above\n\u2248 6keV the fractional amplitudes of the fundamental and\nsecond harmonic are comparable and the overall pulse profile is double peaked (Fig. 1, see also Hartman et al. 2009).\n\n3\n\n1\n\nXMM-Newton observations of SAX J1808.4-3658\n\nHigh-resolution spectroscopy\n\nWe inferred the interstellar medium (ISM) abundances in\na model independent way, by separately fitting the absorption edges to the RGS data. We used only the RGS1 and\n\n\f5\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe observed for the first time the pulsations in the 0.32 keV energy range for J1808. The pulse fractional amplitudes sharply decrease below \u2248 2keV during the 2008\nXMM\u2013Newton observation. Our spectral analysis required\na multi temperature blackbody at low energies that we identify with the accretion disc emission, as well as the main\nsource of unpulsed emission. We interpret the higher energy\nblackbody as the emission coming from the hot spot of the\nneutron star. The power law is also a pulsed component,\nsince we measured \u2248 2% rms pulse amplitudes up to 12 keV\nwere the power law emission dominates.\nThe empirical power-law model requires a disc contributing only \u2248 30% of the power-law flux below 2 keV\n(Fig 2). Therefore the disc is not the only responsible of the\n\n0.525\n\n0.53\n0.535\nEnergy (keV)\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212 instrumental\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212 O III\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212 O II\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212 O I\n\n30\nCounts/s/keV\n20\n\nRGS2 first order spectra, which are the best calibrated and\nhave a higher number of counts. The continuum parameters were kept fixed at the value reported in Table 1. We\nused vphabs that allows to set fixed abundance parameters\nwith respect to the solar composition and to isolate the single absorption edges. The strongest features were observed\naround the OK -edge (OK ; see Fig.3). To model this edge we\nfixed at zero the oxygen abundance of the vphabs model,\nand fit only the data around the OK with an edge model\n(note that the continuum is relatively constant in the small\nenergy range around the edge itself, hence the modelling is\nindependent on the broadband continuum model).The best\nfit gives OK = 0.5421 \u00b1 0.0003 keV and \u03c4 = 0.66 \u00b1 0.01,\nwith \u03c4x = Nx \u00d7 \u03c3 and \u03c3 the photoelectric cross section.\nWith the same method we fitted also the iron L (F eL ), neon\nK (N eK ), magnesium K (M gK ) and silicon K (SiK ) edges\nthat lie in the RGS band. The column density for each element is reported in Tab.2. The absorption features close\nto OK were fitted with Gaussian lines and were identified\nas 1s \u2212 2p atomic transitions of O I, O II and O III. The\nO IV line lies too close to an instrumental bad column to\nbe detectable. The levels higher than IV are not detected,\nwith a 98% upper limit of 0.08 eV on the equivalent width\n(EW). Similar features have been observed in other X-ray\nbinaries like XB 1254\u2013690 (D\u0131\u0301az Trigo et al. 2009) and Cyg\nX-2 (Takei et al. 2002; Costantini et al. 2005).\nFrom the single absorption edges we calculated the\ncolumn density of each element (\u03c4x = Nx \u00d7 \u03c3) assuming photoelectric cross sections from Gould & Jung (1991).\nThe equivalent hydrogen column density is inferred from\nthe best measured edge (OK ), by using abundances from\nWilms et al. (2000). We derived NH = (1.4 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7\n1021 cm\u22122 , consistent with the value derived in the direction of J1808 from both HI and HII measurements (1.3 \u00d7\n1021 cm\u22122 and 1.14 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 ; Dickey & Lockman 1990\nand Kalberla et al. 2005 respectively).\nFrom the measurement of the EW of the oxygen I,\nII, and III 1s \u2212 2p transitions, using the method of the\ncurve of growth, we have an independent measure of the\nrelative oxygen abundances, using the formula EW\u03bb =\n8.85 \u00d7 10\u221213 Nx \u03bb2 fij , where \u03bb is the wavelength of the line,\nand fij the oscillator strength for the transition (Spitzer\n1978). We found an Noxygen consistent with that inferred\nfrom the OK -edge (see Tab. 2).\n\n40\n\nPatruno et al.\n\n10\n\n4\n\n0.54\n\nFigure 3.

Spectral parameters for J1808 in outburst, from combined pn and all RGS data. Errors are at 1\u03c3 confidence level.\nNH is calculated with abundances from Wilms et al. (2000).

The lower limit is quoted at 95%\nconfidence level. b. \u03b2 is the power law index of the emissivity\n\nsteep decrease of pulse fractional amplitudes below 2 keV.\nHowever, an empirical power-law model is unphysical and a\nself consistent physical scenario would require a sharp decrease of the power-law component below \u2248 2 \u2212 3 keV. In\nthat case the unpulsed disc emission might dominate below\n2 keV and explain the sudden drop of the pulse amplitudes\nat those energies. A Comptonization model with a shocked\nplasma in a slab geometry is expected to cut off below \u2248 3\nkeV and was already proposed by Gierli\u0144ski & Poutanen\n(2005) for the AMXP XTE J1751-305.

Interstellar medium edges and lines in the direction of\nSAX J1808.4-3658. Photoelectric cross sections (\u03c3) are in units of\n10\u221219 cm2 (from Gould & Jung 1991), while the column densities\nNx are in units of 1017 cm\u22122 .\n\ning emission of the hot spot, the multi temperature blackbody by the unpulsed radiation of the accretion disc and the\nhard component by the pulsed comptonized radiation of the\nshock around the hot spot.\nThe origin of the second harmonic can be related to a\ndifferent pulse profile of the hard emission compared to the\nlower-energy blackbody as was suggested by Gierli\u0144ski et al.\n(2002) and Poutanen & Gierli\u0144ski (2003) for RXTE observations of J1808, and by Gierli\u0144ski & Poutanen (2005) for\nXMM and RXTE observations of XTE J1751-305. This\nmight result from a different angular distribution of the\nComptonized radiation, which is expected as it is produced\nin the optically thin accretion shock, but not at the stellar\nsurface as the blackbody emission.\nThe reason why the phase of the fundamental is correlated with the X-ray flux while the second harmonic is\nnot, can then be related with different formation processes\nfor the fundamental and the second harmonic. If the hot\nspot contributes only to the fundamental frequency while\nthe comptonization region contributes to both the fundamental and the second harmonic, the fundamental pulse\nphase may track the hot spot position. The phase of the\nsecond harmonic instead will be affected by the comptonization process and might come from an extended region around the hot spot, covering a large area of the neutron star surface. The hot spot can instead come from a\nwell defined region on the neutron star surface, and can\nmove according to the X-ray flux fluctuations thus producing the pulse phase wandering correlated with X-ray flux\n(Romanova et al. 2004, Lamb et al. 2008).\nWe also measured the first model independent column\ndensities of several elements in the line of sight of J1808\n(Tab. 2). The most precise measurement comes from the oxygen column density, from which we could derive the equivalent hydrogen column density NH = 1.4\u00d71021 cm\u22122 , assuming abundances from Wilms et al. 2000. This determination\nis particularly important: i) in the study of the X-ray emission of this object during quiescence and cooling, where the\nuncertainty in the assumed NH value could alter the reliability of the source intrinsic luminosity (see for example\nHeinke et al. 2009 for cooling studies of SAX J1808.4-3658\nand Yakovlev et al. 2005 for a discussion of the problem),\nand ii) for optical studies who can now rely on a more precise determination of the extintion value toward this system.\n\n5\n\nIt is ineresting to compare the abundances we derived\nfrom the edge fitting with the expected value for the ISM (as\nreported by Wilms et al. 2000). We find that in the direction\nof J1808, the Ne/O abundance is \u223c0.23, slightly larger than\nin the ISM (\u223c 0.18), which maybe be poiting to a Ne-rich\nenvironment as observed in other low mass X-ray binaries\n(Juett et al. 2001).\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank the XMM\u2013Newton observatory for promptly assigning us an observation of SAX J1808.4-3658 through its\nDirector's Discretionary Time.
