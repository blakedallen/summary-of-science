The understanding of\nwater movements within the pore network of stone, which affect the behaviour of porous\nmaterials, are essential. The study of porous media and water transfer in fresh stones is a first\nstep in order to analyse and to model deterioration process. In this paper, two sedimentary\nlimestones are chosen. The first one, called tuffeau, is a stone commonly used in most of\nmonuments built along the Loire valley in France. Meanwhile, it is necessary to note the great\ndiversity of the tuffeau family (important variability of minerals proportion and porosity [1]).\nSo, studied tuffeau is tuffeau of Saumur, extracted from an underground quarry, and the other\none, S\u00e9bastopol stone, is obtained from a quarry near Paris.\n\nCHARACTERIZATION OF THE STUDIED STONES\nTHE SOLID PHASE\nThe mineralogical composition of studied stones is obtained by several complementary\ntechniques : X-ray diffraction, infrared and Raman spectroscopies, thermogravimetric analysis,\nICP, EMPA coupled with analysis from optical microscopy.\nIn tuffeau and S\u00e9bastopol stone as in many sedimentary rocks, the main crystalline phases are\ncalcite CaCO3 and silica SiO2 in the form of quartz. But other minerals are found in the tuffeau\nas clays (e.g. glauconie which appears greenish in optical microscopy) and micas visible to the\nnaked eye, and especially another crystalline form of silica named opal cristobalite-tridymite\n(opal CT). It is also interesting to note the presence of a small quantity of minerals which\nappear with a metal luster as seen in optical microscopy. Indeed, very small grains of titanium\noxyde TiO2 are found rather uniformly spread, both in the tuffeau and the S\u00e9bastopol stone.\nOther detritic minerals like zircon are also found in small grains spread in the S\u00e9bastopol stone.\n\n\f6th International Symposium on the Conservation of Monuments in the Mediterranean Basin\n\nCalcium carbonate is distributed among sparitic and micritic calcite, and fossil shells. The\ncalcite proportion is quantified using the mass loss resulting from calcite decomposition around\n700\u00b0C. The weight ratio of CaCO3 is 49.6% for tuffeau and 79.5% for S\u00e9bastopol stone. So,\none can classify S\u00e9bastopol stone as a limestone while the tuffeau should be classified as a\nsiliceous limestones [2].\nThe grain morphology is determined from SEM images on fragments of stones (Figs. 1 and 2).\nThe difference in the grain sizes for the two stones is clearly observed. The grains of the\nS\u00e9bastopol stone, as well as the marine fossils being there, are rather homogeneous and large,\nwhile size and shape of the constituent grains of the tuffeau are varied but finer. Indeed, due to\nthe multi-phase aspect, tuffeau is constituted with grains of very different sizes and shapes.\nOne can find in the tuffeau rather voluminous grains of quartz, but also aggregates of small\ncrystals of micritic calcite, small fossil shells, and objects formed during the sedimentation: the\nopal CT spherules with their characteristic surface [3]. The texture of stones observed by SEM\nimages allows to see the complexity of the porous network generated with these grains.\n\nFig. 1. SEM image of tuffeau\n\nFig. 2. SEM image of S\u00e9bastopol stone\n\nTHE POROUS PHASE\nThe pore space is investigated by various methods like mercury porosimetry, BET\nmeasurements and 2D images analysis.\nThe porosity is determined from dry bulk and skeletal densities measured by hydrostatic\nweighing (table 1). Measurements by Helium pycnometry confirm these results (\u03c1s = 2.53\ng/cm3 for tuffeau and \u03c1s = 2.70 g/cm3 for S\u00e9bastopol stone). Values of total porosity are near\n45% for both stones, which indicates that these stones are highly porous and so particularly\nlight building materials.\nBulk dry density \u03c1b\nTuffeau\n1.307\nS\u00e9bastopol stone\n1.576\nTable 1 : densities and porosity\n\nSkeletal density \u03c1s\n2.545\n2.713\n\nPorosity\n48.6%\n41.9%\n\nMercury porosimetry give information about pore sizes distribution (Figs. 3 and 4). For both\nstones, results are dissimilar: tuffeau has a very wide range of pore sizes (from 20 \u03bcm to 7 nm),\nwhich demonstrate clearly the multi-scale nature of tuffeau pore space relative to S\u00e9bastopol\n\n\f6th International Symposium on the Conservation of Monuments in the Mediterranean Basin\n\nstone [2], whereas the major part of pore sizes for S\u00e9bastopol stone is restricted from 40 \u03bcm to\n1 \u03bcm.\nThe total porosity are nearly the same, but due to differences between mineralogical\nconstitution, grain sizes and shape arrangements, their pore space structure are completely\ndifferent. S\u00e9bastopol stone is constitued with large grains, so the pore space is large. Tuffeau is\nconstitued by various small grains with various morphologies like clays, micas, opal CT\nspherules. The arrangement of larger grains generate macro-porosity, and micro-porosity is\nformed by the finest phases' morphology and arrangement.\n\n0,2\n\n0,03\n\n0,15\n\n0,02\n\n0,1\n0,01\n\n0\n0,001\n\n0\n0,01\n\n0,1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\npore diameter (\u03bcm)\n\nFig. 3.

Pore size distribution of S\u00e9bastopol\nstone from mercury porosimetry\n\nThe backscattered SEM images of polished cuttings allow to show the various kinds of pores\n(Figs. 5 and 6). These images give additional information to those obtained by the mercury\nporosimetry technique: for S\u00e9bastopol stone, the size of major pores is near 20 \u03bcm whereas the\nSEM photograph show several pores with a diameter near 100 \u03bcm. This is mainly due to the\nshape hypothesis and the model of cylindrical pores in mercury porosimetry analysis. And,\nthere is also the \"ink-bottle\" effect which reduces the volume of the large pores to the benefit\nof small pores [4]. The term diameter in mercury porosimetry is then very relative as it\ncharacterizes only the entry diameter to the pore access. This effect is more visible for\nS\u00e9bastopol stone because the large pores seem be connected by narrowings proportionately\nsmaller compared to tuffeau.\n\nFig. 5.

Backscattered SEM photograph of\nS\u00e9bastopol stone (porosity : 41.9%)\n\n\f6th International Symposium on the Conservation of Monuments in the Mediterranean Basin\n\nThese classical methods will be completed with 3D images obtained by X-ray tomography.\nIndeed, this tool allows to get informations about the connectivity and the topology of the pore\nnetwork. Furthermore, 3D information will be useful for the modeling of water transfer in the\nporous media. Finally, NMR is also informative to investigate the liquid water diffusion\ncoefficient and consequently determine the tortuosity of pore network.\n\nWATER TRANSFER PROPERTIES\n\n10,0\n\n1,0\n\n8,0\n\n0,8\n\nwater content w (% )\n\nwater content w (% )\n\nThe water retention measurement gives information about the ability of the stone to trap water\nfrom its atmospheric environment (Figs. 7 and 8).

Water retention curve of S\u00e9bastopol\nstone\n\nThe tuffeau traps easily the humidity from air and can then contain a lot of water mainly for the\nhighest humidities. This is due to the important micro-porosity and to the presence of clayey\nminerals. In comparaison, the S\u00e9bastopol stone adsorbs very few amount of water, and even in\nvery wet atmospheres, the stone remains practicaly dry. This behaviour is due to the absence of\nclay minerals and to a pore distribution almost exclusively constituted with very large pores.\nThese water retention measurements can be completed up to saturation by means of others\ntechniques like osmotic solutions (polyetylene glycol) and tensiometric plates, imposing\nsmaller capillary pressures [5].\nThe macroscopic water movement, essential for deterioration study, is mainly due to liquid\nwater transfer. And this water is absorbed by capillary imbibition. The phenomenon of\ncapillarity is directly related to the pore network characteristics: pore sizes and pore shapes, but\nalso the connectivity and the topology of the porous structure.\nTheoretical capillary model [6] is based on absorption by capillarity for a vertical cylindrical\ntube of limited height (allowing to neglect gravity). The Washburn's equations give the\ncapillary height (h) and the mass uptake (dm) per surface unit (S) during an elapsed time (t):\n\nh=\n\nr\u03c3 t = B t\n2\u03b7\n\ndm = A t\nS\n\n\f6th International Symposium on the Conservation of Monuments in the Mediterranean Basin\n\nwhere \u03b7 is the kinematic water viscosity and \u03c3 is its superficial tension.\nIn this test, samples, in contact with water, are weighed and the height of the capillary front are\nmeasured according to the elapsed time. In spite of the cylindrical capillary approximation, the\ncurves of capillary ascent and mass uptake drawn according to the square root of the elapsed\ntime (not shown here) are linear. This indicates that the pore network is homogeneous [7].\nThese stones have relatively high capillary kinetics (table 2) comparated to less porous stones\nwith smaller pore diameter [8], but the imbibition coefficients of the S\u00e9bastopol stone are about\n2 times higher than those of the tuffeau. This confirms the influence of pore size on the\nimbibition kinetics. These results should be correlated to SEM images, the S\u00e9bastopol stone\npossesses larger pores relative to those of the tuffeau.\nImbibition leads also to determine the anisotropy of these porous media (table 2). The\nimbibition kinetics being faster in the direction parallel to the bedding direction. The\nS\u00e9bastopol stone presents a capillary anisotropy of about 20 %, while the tuffeau presents an\nanisotropy of about 15 %.\nMass uptake coefficient A Capillary front coefficient B\n(g/cm2/min1/2)\n(cm/min1/2)\nTuffeau\n\u22a5 stone bed : 0.36\n\u22a5 stone bed : 0.96\n// stone bed : 0.42\n// stone bed : 1.13\nS\u00e9bastopol stone\n\u22a5 stone bed : 0.62\n\u22a5 stone bed : 2.20\n// stone bed : 0.77\n// stone bed : 2.72\nTable 2 : imbibition coefficients in relation to bedding directions\nThis liquid water transfer study will be completed with vapour transfer analysis by\ndetermination of evaporation kinetics and diffusion experiments. Measurements of water\nvapour diffusion are carried out according the water content at steady state. This allows to\ncalculate vapour diffusion coefficient and hydraulic conductivity variations as a function of the\ndegree of saturation of stones [9].\n\nFINAL REMARKS\nIn spite of similar total porosities, these two stones possess very different pore size\ndistributions. This induces different behaviours relative to water. Indeed, tuffeau and\nS\u00e9bastopol stone are very porous limestones, with a total porosity near 45%. But, the\nmorphology of the solid phase and the porous phase are very dissimilar. Most of the grains of\nS\u00e9bastopol stone are large, whereas grains of tuffeau are smaller and varied with different size\nand shape (sparitic and micritic calcite, clay, mica, opal CT spherules). The arrangement of the\ngrains in S\u00e9bastopol stone is mainly restricted to macropores whereas tuffeau has a very wide\nrange of pore sizes with a relatively important micro-porosity. This difference is observed in\nthe water retention curve and imbibition properties. The tuffeau traps easily humidity from air\nwhereas S\u00e9bastopol stone is absolutely not hygroscopic. However imbibition kinetics of\nS\u00e9bastopol stone are about 2 times higher.\nTo understand stone deterioration, it is necessary at least to study water transfer properties of\nthe stones and water effect on them. And, to understand its water transfer behaviour, it is\nnecessary to understand first the geometry of its porous phase.\n\n\f6th International Symposium on the Conservation of Monuments in the Mediterranean Basin\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHIC REFERENCES\n[1] Dessandier David \u2013 Etude du milieux poreux et des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de transfert des fluides du\ntuffeau blanc de Tourraine.
