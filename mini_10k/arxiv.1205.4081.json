Introduction\nIt is well known that a turbulent plasma is a source of electromagnetic emission\nat the fundamental plasma frequency \u03c9p and its second harmonic. These emission\nmechanisms have been found to play an important role in different space phenomena\nsuch as type III solar radio bursts [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and radiations of planet's\nmagnetospheres [6, 7]. Plasma emissions at \u03c9p and 2\u03c9p have been also observed\nin laboratory beam-plasma experiments [8, 9, 10, 11]. In contrast to the problem of\ntype III radio bursts, in which the density of wave energy W is saturated at weakly\nturbulent levels W/nT \u223c 10\u22125 (n is the plasma density, T is the temperature of\nplasma electrons), we focus our attention on the regime of strong plasma turbulence\nW/nT \u223c 10\u22122 \u2212 10\u22121 , which is more appropriate for laboratory experiments with\npowerful electron beams [12, 13, 14].\nBeam-plasma experiments at mirror traps [14, 15] have demonstrated that the\n2\nrelativistic electron beam with the typical energy 1 MeV and current density 1 kA/cm\n14\n\u22123\ninjected into the plasma with n = 2 * 10 cm loses about 30% of its energy over the\nlength of 1 m. It means that the averaged power density pumping by the beam to the\n3\nplasma turbulence can be estimated as \u223c 10 MW/cm . The rate of beam energy losses,\nhowever, is not uniform over this length. The estimate for the peak pumping power\ncan be derived assuming that a significant part of beam energy goes to excitation of the\nlarge amplitude coherent wave-packet at the entrance to the plasma column. Since the\nbeam is decelerated over the packet length l \u223c vb /\u0393 by \u2206v \u223c vb \u0393/\u03c9p [16], where \u0393 is\n\n\fGeneration of powerful terahertz emission\n\n2\n\nthe growth-rate of the two-stream instability and vb is the beam velocity, the maximum\n3\npower of beam energy losses reaches the value \u223c 100 MW/cm . Thus, if only 1% of\npumping power is able to convert to electromagnetic radiation, the maximum power\ndensity of plasma emission produced in beam-plasma experiments at mirror traps can\n3\nreach the range of 1 MW/cm . The same level of conversion has been observed recently\nin laboratory experiments [11] with the low plasma density n = 2 * 1014 cm\u22123 , that is\nwhy it allows us to suppose that, in a denser plasma, a beam excited turbulence can\nbe also considered as an efficient source of powerful electromagnetic radiation. The\naim of this paper is to calculate the conversion efficiency as well as absolute values\nof emission power for the case when second harmonic plasma emission falls in the\nterahertz frequency range.\nOur calculations of the spectral power of electromagnetic emission produced in\na turbulent magnetized plasma are based on the theoretical model [17], in which it\nis assumed that electromagnetic waves are generated predominantly in the source\nregion of strong plasma turbulence due to coalescence of upper-hybrid waves. Since\ntheoretical predictions have been found to agree with recent experimental results [11]\nobtained at the GOL-3 multimirror trap in the low density regime, we can use this\nmodel to study spectral and angular characteristics of electromagnetic emission for\nthe whole ranges of plasma density and turbulence energy, which can be achieved in\nour beam-plasma experiments.\nThus, in Section 2, we formulate the main ideas of theoretical model that takes\ninto account not only spontaneous generation of electromagnetic waves in coalescence\nprocesses, but also contributions of induced inverse processes. In Section 3, we present\ncalculations of second harmonic emission power in the terahertz frequency range and\nstudy whether this emission can escape from the plasma. Our main results are\nsummarized in concluding Section 4.\n2. Theoretical model\nTo calculate the emission power from turbulent magnetized plasma we use the model\nof strong plasma turbulence proposed in [17]. According to this model, we assume\nthat most of wave energy is concentrated in upper-hybrid modes, whichpoccupy the\nlong-wavelength region of turbulent spectrum with wavenumbers k < W/nT /rD\n(rD is the Debye length). The saturation level of this energy is determined by the\nbalance between the constant power Pb pumping to the turbulence by the beam and\nthe power dissipated due to the wave collapse. It results in the following relation\nbetween the pumping power and the turbulence energy:\n\u0012\n\u00131/2 \u0012\n\u00132\nme\nW\nPb \u223c \u03c9p nT\n,\n(1)\nmi\nnT\nwhere mi is the ion mass and me is the electron mass.\nWe calculate the electromagnetic emission power P and the conversion efficiency\n\u000f = P/Pb assuming that electromagnetic waves are generated due to coalescence of\nlong-wavelength upper-hybrid waves. Since in the source region of turbulent spectrum\nthese waves are not trapped in collapsing caverns, nonlinear interaction between\nelectromagnetic and upper-hybrid modes can be treated in the framework of weak\nturbulence. In this case, generation of electromagnetic radiation is described by the\n\n\fGeneration of powerful terahertz emission\n\n3\n\nequation\n\u2202Wkt\n= Pk \u2212 2\u03b3k Wkt ,\n(2)\n\u2202t\nwhere Pk is the power of spontaneous emission produced in the coalescence process\n` + ` \u2192 t and \u03b3k is the nonlinear dissipation rate due to the decay t \u2192 ` + `.\nIn dimensionless units \u03c9p t, \u03c9/\u03c9p , x\u03c9p /c, kc/\u03c9p , for time, frequency, position and\nwavenumber, respectively, the spectral wave energy is normalized by the condition\nZ\nW\u03c3\n,\n(3)\nWk\u03c3 d3 k =\nnme c2\nwhere c is the speed of light.

It results in correlation broadening of the resonance\n\u03c9kt \u2212 \u03c9k` 1 \u2212 \u03c9k` 2 = 0, which is described in (4) by the function\n\u2206k,k1 ,k2 =\n\n2\u03bd/\u03c0\n\u03c9kt\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c9k` 1\n\n\u2212 \u03c9k` 2\n\n\u00012\n\n+ 4\u03bd 2\n\n.\n\n(10)\n\n\fGeneration of powerful terahertz emission\n\n4\n\nThis function shows that the width of frequency spectrum of second harmonic\nelectromagnetic emission depends essentially on nonlinear effects as well as on thermal\nand magnetic corrections to the linear dispersion of upper-hybrid modes. In order\nto minimize the frequency width of radiation, we should consider the case, when\nthe ratio of the electron cyclotron frequency to the plasma frequency becomes low\n\u03a9 = \u03c9c /\u03c9p = 0.2 resulting in comparable contributions of magnetic and thermal\neffects for the typical plasma temperature T = 1 keV in mirror traps.

Computation results\nLet us study the spectral and angular characteristics of second harmonic plasma\nemission for various regimes of beam-plasma interaction, which can be realized in\nmirror traps. We will vary the plasma density from 2 * 1014 cm\u22123 to 5 * 1015 cm\u22123 for\ndifferent fixed values of turbulence energy W/nT = 0.01, 0.05, 0.1 and for the fixed\nparameters T = 1 keV and \u03a9 = 0.2.\n\n\fGeneration of powerful terahertz emission\nx-mode\n\n(b)\n\n3\n\n2\n\nq, rad\n\nq, rad\n\n(a)\n\n5\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n1.8\n\n(c)\n\n2.0\n\nw/wp\n\n2.2\n\n2.4\n\n(d)\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\nq, rad\n\nq, rad\n\no-mode\n3\n\n1.8\n\n2.0\n\n2.2\n\n2.4\n\n1.8\n\n2.0\n\n2.2\n\n2.4\n\nw/wp\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n1.8\n\n2.0\n\nw/wp\n\n2.2\n\n2.4\n\nw/wp\n\nFigure 1.

In our computations, the isotropic\npart occupies uniformly the spectral region kc/\u03c9p \u2208 (0.1, km c/\u03c9p ), where the upper\nbound\ncorresponds to the typical wavenumber of the modulation instability km '\np\nW/nT /rD and the lower bound excludes modes with wavelengths larger than the\ntypical plasma size. According to the model [17], the anisotropic population of beamdriven waves contains a small fraction of energy (10%) and occupies the region:\nkc/\u03c9p \u2208 (1.1, 1.3) and \u03b8 \u2208 (0, 0.3).\nIn the regime with n = 3 * 1015 cm\u22123 and W/nT = 0.05, computation results for\nthe spectral density of emission power dP/(d\u03c9d\u03b8) for extraordinary (x) and ordinary\n(o) electromagnetic modes are presented in Figures 1(a) and 1(b), respectively. It is\nseen that x-mode emission is dominated by the contribution of obliquely propagating\nwaves with \u03b8 = 300 and \u03b8 = 1500 , whereas the most intensive o-mode emission\nis concentrated near the transverse to the magnetic field direction. Calculations\nof the path length lk for these emissions are shown in Figures 1(c) and 1(d). As\none can see, the path length reaches the minimal value 20-40 cm for longitudinally\n\n\fGeneration of powerful terahertz emission\n\n6\n\npropagating modes regardless of their polarization. For transverse propagation, this\nlength increases up to 90 cm for the o-mode and exceeds 3 m for the x-mode. It means\nthat emissions of both electromagnetic modes, generated in the plasma column with\nthe diameter 5\u20136 cm typical to our beam-plasma experiments, are able to escape from\nthe plasma and can be used for different applications.\nLet us now find out how the frequency spectrum of electromagnetic emission,\ndescribed by dP/d\u03c9, depends on the plasma density.

In dimensional form, the linear frequency f corresponding to the maximum of\nthe spectral power dP/d\u03c9 and the width at half maximum \u2206f for a fixed turbulence\nenergy depend on the plasma density as follows: f, \u2206f \u221d n1/2 . Figures 3(a) and 3(b)\ndemonstrate that f and especially \u2206f grow with the increase of the turbulence level.\nIt means that the spectral width of plasma emission in regimes of rather strong plasma\nturbulence is mainly determined by correlation broadening of resonances in nonlinear\nthree-wave interactions.\nTo compute the integral power of second harmonic emission from the unit volume\nof turbulent plasma, we integrate the function dP/d\u03c9 over the frequency range\n\u03c9/\u03c9p \u2208 (1.6, 2.6) and sum over polarizations.

The dependence of integral second harmonic emission power on the\nplasma density for different values of turbulence energy W/nT .\n\nincreases like P \u221d n3/2 with the increase of plasma density for the fixed turbulence\n3\nenergy and reaches the value 1 MW/cm in the regime with n = 3 * 1015 cm\u22123 and\nW/nT = 0.05. It is interesting to note that these calculations adequately describes\nrecent experimental results obtained in the strong magnetic field \u03a9 = 0.8 [11]. Indeed,\n3\nthe 1 kW/cm range of emission power, observed experimentally in the regime with\nn = 2 * 1014 cm\u22123 and W/nT = 0.01, is also reproduced by calculations presented in\nFigure 4. From comparison with the results of [17] we can conclude that the external\nmagnetic field broadens the spectral width of electromagnetic emission, but does not\nchange drastically the integral power. Since the pumping power (1) has the same\ndependence on plasma density as the emission power, the conversion efficiency \u000f in\nour model is completely determined by the turbulence energy. For W/nT = 0.05, this\nefficiency is estimated as \u000f ' 1%.\nTo make clearer understanding how computation results are sensitive to the\nshape of turbulent spectrum, we calculate the spectral emission power for different\nspectra corresponding to the same turbulence energy (Figure 5). When we replace\nthe uniform isotropic spectrum of upper-hybrid modes used in previous calculations\non more realistic falling spectra, changes in the integral emission power do not exceed\n20%.\n\n\fGeneration of powerful terahertz emission\n\n8\n\n(a)\n\n15\n\n-3\n\nn=3*10 cm\n\n2\n\nW/nT=0.05\n\nWk\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\ndP/dw\n\n(b)\n4\n\n1.37 MW/cm\n\n3\n\n1.17 MW/cm\n\n3\n\nkc/w p\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0.97 MW/cm\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n1\n0\n1,6\n\n1,8\n\n2,0\n\nw/wp\n\n2,2\n\n2,4\n\n2,6\n\nFigure 5. Different shapes of the isotropic part of turbulent k-spectra (a) and\nthe corresponding spectral power of electromagnetic emission (b).\n\nIt should be emphasized that the high value of turbulence energy W/nT = 0.05,\n3\nwhich is required to generate 1 THz emission with the power density 1 MW/cm ,\ncan be achieved in beam-plasma experiments at the GOL-3 multimirror trap. Indeed,\n2\nfor the typical beam energy 1 MeV and current density 1.5 kA/cm , the pumping\n3\npower reaches the required level of 100 MW/cm inside the region of most intensive\nbeam-plasma interaction, where large amplitude coherent wave-packets are excited.\nSince the length of this region is estimated as l \u223c vb /\u0393 ' 1 \u2212 3 cm, the total power of\nterahertz emission in our laboratory experiments can reach 30\u2013100 MW.\n4. Conclusion\nThe spectral power of second harmonic electromagnetic emission, generated in the\nlong-wavelength region of strong plasma turbulence due to coalescence of upper-hybrid\nwaves, was calculated for different regimes of beam-plasma interaction, which can be\nrealized in modern experiments at mirror traps. Computation results have shown\nthat beam energy transferred to plasma oscillations in the regime of strong plasma\nturbulence can be converted efficiently to electromagnetic radiation. We have studied\nspectral characteristics of plasma emission in wide ranges of plasma density and\nturbulence energy and shown that the power of terahertz radiation in our beam-plasma\nexperiments can reach tens of MW. Taking into account the angular distribution of\nthis emission and possibility to change the emission frequency by varying the plasma\ndensity we come to the conclusion that terahertz radiation generated in a beam-driven\nstrongly turbulent plasma can be very attractive for different applications.\n\n\fGeneration of powerful terahertz emission\n\n9\n\nAcknowledgments\nAuthors thank I.A.
