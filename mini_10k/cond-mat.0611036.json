In these perovskite compounds,\nthe interplay between magnetism, charge ordering, and electronic transport have been studied\nin detail.1-4 In particular, the metal-insulator transition near the Curie temperature in this class\nof materials have been interpreted in terms of the double exchange (DE) model, in which a\nstrong exchange interaction occurs between Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions through intervening filled\noxygen 2p states.5,6 In addition, there are some other mechanisms that have provided valuable\ninsight into the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) phenomenon in the manganites, such as the\nantiferromagnetic superexchange, Jahn-Teller effects, orbital and charge ordering.7-9 The\nknowledge of the crystal structure and the chemical bonding of these compounds is of capital\nimportance to the understanding of the peculiar magneto-transport properties in these\nperovskites. It is known that the A-site substitution changes primarily the carrier density and\naffects strongly the Mn3+-O-Mn4+ angle (lattice distortion), thus transforming the parent\ncompound RMnO3 from an insulating antiferromagnet into a metallic ferromagnet.4 On the\nother hand, the B-site substitution is a direct way of modifying the crucial Mn3+-O-Mn4+\nnetwork. The effect of substitution of Mn3+ ions in the B-site by trivalent ions such as Fe, Ti,\nand Sc on ferromagnetism and CMR of these manganites has been studied.10-12 It was\nexperimentally found that any modification on the exchange interaction causes the\npair-breaking effect associated with a drastic reduction in Curie temperature TC. For example,\nTC reduced by about 22 K for only 1 at. % Fe substitution for Mn in La0.7Sr0.3MnO3.10 Other\n3d transition metals such as Ti, Co, and Ni have similar substitution effect as Fe.11 However, it\nwas reported that as high as 30 at. % of Ru can be substituted into the Mn sites in\nLa0.7Sr0.3MnO3 with no change in the crystal structure and has a weak effect on the reduction\nin TC.13 It is argued that Ru has a more delocalized 4f orbital with itinerant t2g electrons that\n2\n\n\ffacilitates the exchange coupling interaction. That is, Ru could make a magnetic pair with Mn\nto form the Mn-O-Ru network, thus favoring the DE-mediated transport mechanism.\nEnhanced magnetic and metal-insulator transition temperature in Ru-doped layered\nmagnanites La1.2Ca1.8Mn2-xRuxO7 has been reported.14 Even though a large number of studies\non the Ru-doped manganites have been done, the valence state of Ru, which governs the\nrelationships between the magnetism and transport properties of these compounds, is still a\nsubject of debate. Krishnan and Ju reported the X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) of\nLa0.7Sr0.3Mn0.9Ru0.1O3 in which the Ru3+/Ru4+ mixed state was suggested.15 On the other hand,\nSahu and Manoharan presented the X-ray absorption spectra of the Ru L2,\n\n3\n\nedge in\n\nLa0.6Pb0.4Mn1-xRuxO3 and showed a clear signature of the existence of Ru5+ up to x = 0.2.16\nHowever, a recent X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurement has given a clear proof that\nRu5+ is absent in the Na-doped La1-xNaxMn1\u2013yRuyO3+\u03b4 manganites.17 According to these XPS\nresults the valence state of Ru in manganites has not yet reached a consensus, and thus the\nsource of ferromagnetic interaction between Ru and Mn ions still remains an open question.\nTherefore, it is worth while examining this important issue from a different point of view. Up\nto now, although a large number of investigations focused on the electronic and magnetic\nproperties of the LSMRO compounds,13, 15-19 only a few studies regarding thermal properties\nor higher level of Ru substitution (x \u2265 0.4) were reported in the literature. In this paper, we\nreport a throughout investigation of crystal structure, resistivity, magnetization, specific heat,\nthermal conductivity, and thermoelectric power of La0.7Sr0.3Mn1-xRuxO3 with x = 0 to 0.90. A\ndiscussion of the valence state of Ru based on the results of crystal structure and saturation\nmagnetization is given. Information of such a study makes it possible to determine a full range\nof physical properties in these Ru-doped magnanites.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL METHOD\n\nPolycrystalline samples of La0.7Sr0.3Mn1-xRuxO3 (LSMRO) were synthesized by a\n3\n\n\fconventional solid-state reaction method, using the starting materials of La2O3, SrCO3,\nMnCO3, and RuO2 powders. Stoichiometric mixture of powders were ground and reacted at\no\n\n1100 C for 24 h in air. The samples were reground, pressed into pellets, and heated again at\no\n\n1500 C for 24 h. This procedure was repeated and the samples were finally cooled to room\no\n\ntemperature at the rate of 5 C/min in the last step. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD)\no\n\no\n\no\n\ndata were collected at room temperature from 20 to 80 with a 2\u03b8 step of 0.01 using a\ndiffractometer (Shimazu XRD6000, Japan) with Cu K\u03b1 radiation. The resistivities and\nmagnetizations of samples were obtained by a standard dc four-terminal method, and by a\nsuperconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer, respectively.\nRelative specific heats (CP) were measured with a high-resolution ac calorimeter, using\nchopped light as a heat source. Thermal conductivity (\u03ba) and thermoelectric power (TEP)\nmeasurements were carried out simultaneously in a close-cycle refrigerator by using a\ndirect heat-pulse technique. The details of the measurement techniques can be found\nelsewhere.20\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nA. Crystal structure\nFigure 1 shows the typical \u03b8-2\u03b8 x-ray diffraction spectra of LSMRO with x = 0 \u2013 1.0.\nAs can be seen, the obtained diffraction spectra are consistent with the expected perovskite\nstructure and can be indexed in an orthorhombically distorted structure of space group P2/c. It\nis noted that for LSMRO with x > 0.7, impurity phases such as SrO2 and La2O3 were detected.\nThe intensity of the strongest impurity peaks is around 5% of the main phase. For\nLa0.7Sr0.3RuO3 (x = 1), some diffraction peaks remained unindexed, owing to unidentified\nimpurity phases. Unknown impurity phases have also been observed in La0.5Sr0.5Mn0.5Ru0.5O3\npolycrystalline samples.9 The influence of little impurity phases on the transport properties is\n4\n\n\fthought to be ignorable for LSMRO with x > 0.7 due to the insulating impurities of SrO2 and\nLa2O3. However, the magnetization contributed from the impurity is subtracted. Figures 2(a)\nand 2(b) show the lattice parameters and the unit cell volume Vcell as a function of Ru\nconcentration (x) of LSMRO compounds, respectively. It is clearly seen that the lattice\nparameters a and b increase monotonously with Ru concentration, while the lattice parameter c\nincreases initially for LSMRO for x < 0.6 and then decreases and saturates with higher level of\nsubstitution (x \u2265 0.6). The variation of Vcell shows similar behavior to that of c-axis lattice\nparameter. The increase of lattice parameters at low levels of Ru substitution has also been\nobserved in Ru-doped La0.67Ca0.33MnO3 samples.21 The variation of lattice parameters\nprovides us valuable information into a further consideration of the valence state of Ru in\nthese compounds. Since Ru3+ (0.68 \u00c5) and Ru4+ (0.62 \u00c5) have larger ionic radii compared\nwith that of the Mn3+ (0.65 \u00c5) - Mn4+ (0.52 \u00c5) pair, it is inferred that Ru should have a mixed\nvalence of Ru3+ and Ru4+, which could account for the observed increase in the lattice\nparameters for LSMRO with low level of Ru substitution (x < 0.6). In view of the fact that\nlattice parameters decrease with further Ru substitution (x \u2265 0.6), it is expected that an\nadditional valence of Ru5+ (0.56 \u00c5) might exist in the highly substituted compounds. As\npreviously mentioned, the XPS measurements showed ambiguous results of Ru valence state,\nwe will further discuss this issue in the following section with a different point of view.\n\nB. Magnetization\nFigure 3 shows the temperature dependence of the zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and\nfield-cooled (FC) magnetization for LSMRO. As can be seen, all the LSMRO samples\nundergo a paramagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition. It is found that the Curie\ntemperature TC, determined by extrapolating linearly the temperature dependence of\nmagnetic susceptibility 1/\u03c7 in the paramagnetic state, decreases with increasing x. The\nvariance of Curie temperature TC versus Ru concentration for x \u2264 0.25 is tabulated in Table\n5\n\n\fI. The observed decrease of TC is in good agreement with that reported in Ref. 15. This\nmagnetic-transition behavior reveals the long-range ferromagnetic ordering up to x = 0.9,\nindicating strong ferromagnetic exchange coupling between Mn and Ru centers.\nInterestingly, the difference between the ZFC and FC magnetization results is more\npronounced with larger Ru substitution level, and the ZFC magnetization shows a sharp\ndecrease at low temperatures. This large thermomagnetic irreversibility has also been\nobserved by others and interpreted as a cluster glass behavior.12,\n\n21\n\nSuch a feature is\n\nattributed to a spin freezing below the irreversibility temperature T*, being often observed\nin inhomogeneous magnetic systems with ferromagnetic grains embedded in a\nnon-ferromagnetic background. On the contrary, the difference between FC and ZFC curves\nobserved in the LSMRO samples becomes less obvious with lower Ru substitution (x < 0.2),\nreflecting the domain-motion character and larger ferromagnetic grains in the samples. The\nirreversibility temperature T* decreases with an increase in Ru substitution, as seen in the\ninset of Fig. 3. These M(T) behaviors are similar to those observed in Ru-doped\nLa0.6Pb0.4Mn1-xRuxO3 samples.16\nFigure 4 shows typical hysteresis loops of the LSMRO compounds measured at 5 K.\nAs can be seen, there is an increase in the coercive field with increasing Ru substitution,\nimplying that the domain wall pinning increases with increasing x. Furthermore, the value\nof saturation magnetization MS can be approximately obtained from the high-field\nmagnetization. The inset of Fig. 4 shows the magnetic moment \u03bcS for the Mn/Ru site\nestimated from the experimental MS value as a function of Ru concentration. The obtained\n\n\u03bcS for the x = 0 compound is 3.45\u03bcB, close to the theoretical value of 3.67\u03bcB. It is noted that\n\u03bcS decreases quasilinearly with increase in x, but a noticeable slope change is observed at x\n= 0.5. This phenomenon is ascribed to the appearance of different valence states of Ru ions\nin the low-doping (Ru3+) and high-doping regions (Ru5+). It has been proposed that Ru3+,\nwith a half-filled shell electronic configuration, will result in a local antiferromagnetic\n6\n\n\fcoupling with neighboring Mn ions.17 On the contrary, the introduction of Ru5+ will lead to\nferromagnetic coupling with Mn spins, which has been proposed for Sm1-xCaxMn1-yRuyO3\nseries.22\n\nWith the assumption that a mixed valence of Ru3+/Ru4+ in the lower-doping\n\nregion (x \u2264 0.5) while an additional mixed valence of Ru4+/Ru5+ appears in the high-doping\nregion (x > 0.5), we can make a rough estimation for the magnetic moment of these\nLSMRO\n\nsamples.\n\nThe\n\ncompounds\n\nwith\n\na\n\nchemical\n\nformula\n\nLa03.+7 Sr02.3+ ( Mn1\u2212 x Ru x ) 30+.7 ( Mn1\u2212 x Ru x ) 04.+3 O3 (for x \u2264 0.5) lead to a ferromagnetic moment of\n\n\u03bcS (x \u2264 0.5) = [4(0.7-0.7x)-3(0.7x)+3(0.3-0.3x)+2(0.3x)]\u03bcB = (3.7- 5.2x)\u03bcB,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03bc Mn3+ = 4\u03bcB ( t 23g e1g state), \u03bc Mn 4+ = 3\u03bcB ( t 23g eg0 state), \u03bc Ru 3+ = 3\u03bcB ( t 25g state), and\n\n\u03bc Ru = 2\u03bcB (low-spin t 24g state) are used. For the higher-doping LSMRO with x > 0.5, it\n4+\n\ncan be simply assumed that the increasing Ru concentration has the valence of Ru5+. As a\nresult, the chemical formula for the high Ru substituted compounds can be represented by\nLa03.+7 Sr02.3+ ( Mn1\u2212 x + 3 y Ru0.5 ) 30.+7 ( Mn1\u2212 x \u2212 y Ru0.5 ) 04.+3 Ru x5\u2212+0.5O3 , where y is the reduced component of\n7\n\nMn4+ due to the presence of Ru5+. According to the conservation of total valence, it can be\nobtained that y =\n\n17\n(x \u2212 0.5) , and the ferromagnetic moment for x > 0.5 is\n9\n\n\u03bc S ( x > 0.5) = (\n\n13 6.4\n\u2212\nx) \u03bc B ,\n6\n3\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03bc Ru 5+ = 1\u03bcB (low-spin t 23g state) parallel to the Mn and Ru4+ moments is used.\nEquations (1) and (2) satisfy the situation that (1) = (2) = 1.1 \u03bcB with x = 0.5. The\ncalculated \u03bcS as a function of x is also shown in the inset of Fig. 4 by dotted lines using Eqs.\n(1) and (2). As can be seen, the calculated \u03bcS is in excellent agreement with the\nexperimental \u03bcS, indicating the validity of our proposal assumption on the variation of\nvalence states of Ru ions in these LSMRO compounds.\n\n7\n\n\fC. Resistivity\n\nThe temperature-dependent resistivities (\u03c1 versus T) between 20 to 500 K of LSMRO\nare shown in Figures 5(a) and 5(b) for x \u2265 0.3 and x \u2264 0.25, respectively. In general, we\nfound that an increase in Ru substitution for Mn causes a substantial growth on the\nelectrical resistivity of LSMRO. It is seen that the system exhibits metallic behavior\n(positive temperature coefficient) for low Ru substitution samples ( x \u2264 0.15 ), but shows\nsemiconducting characteristics (negative temperature coefficient) for high Ru substitution\nsamples ( x \u2265 0.25 ). With decreasing temperature, noticeable decrease in \u03c1 marks the\noccurrence of metal-insulator transitions in the low Ru substitution samples. The\nmetal-insulator transition temperature TMI, determined from the maximum of d\u03c1/dT,\nincreases initially on Ru substitution ( x = 0.10 ), then decreases upon further substitution of\nRu ions, and finally disappears with x \u2265 0.50 in this series of materials, as the resistivity\nshows no sign of anomaly but exhibits insulating behavior for x = 0.5. In Table I, we list the\nmetal-insulator transition temperature TMI with respect to respective compositions for this\nseries of compounds with 0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.25. A semiconducting-like characteristics for\n0.25 \u2264 x \u2264 0.40 samples below TMI's is observed, and it can be explained by the charge\n\ncarrier localization due to doping-induced random magnetic potential. On the other hand,\nan insulating behavior above TMI for x \u2265 0.2 is observed, leading to a temperature\ndependence of \u03c1 which can be described by two approaches. One is the variable-range\nhopping of electrons in a band of localized states,23 and the other is the polaron formation\ndue to lattice distortion (polaron hopping model).24 It is found that the data can be fitted\ninto the variable-range-hopping equation,23 \u03c1 = \u03c1\u221e exp[(T0/T)1/4], to a reasonably good\ndegree with T0 \u2248 (1.4 \u2013 18)\u00d7106 K and \u03c1\u221e \u2248 (4 \u2013 370) \u03bc\u03a9 cm. Even though these fitting\nparameters are comparable with those obtained in Sc-substituting La0.7Ca0.3MnO3,12 the\nobtained prefactor \u03c1\u221e is unphysical as discussed by Gayathri et al. for Co-substituting\nLa0.7Ca0.3MnO3.25 Typical \u03c1\u221e should be of the order of \u03c1mott, the maximum metallic\n8\n\n\fresistivity, which is seldom below 1 \u2013 10 m\u03a9 cm for these oxides.26 This makes the\nvariable-range hopping an unreasonable proposition for the electrical transport mechanism\nof LSMRO.\nAlternatively, as shown in the inset of Fig. 5(a), we found that the high-temperature\nresistivity of LSMRO (x \u2265 0.2) can be fitted by the nonadiabatic small polaron hopping\nmodel,\n3\n\n\u239b E\u03b1 \u239e\n\u239f\u239f ,\nk\nT\n\u239d B \u23a0\n\n\u03c1 = RT 2 exp\u239c\u239c\n\n(3)\n\nwhere R is a constant, Ea is the resistivity activation energy, and kB is the Boltzmann\nconstant. The resistivity activation energy Ea as a function of Ru substitution is shown in\nthe inset of Fig. 5(b). As can be seen, Ea increases rapidly with increase in x for x \u2264 0.4, but\ndecreases in the higher Ru-doping region (x \u2265 0.5). The obtained Ea values of 103 \u2013 161\nmeV are comparable with those of 135 \u2013 160 meV for Co-substituting La0.7Ca0.3MnO3. 25 It\nis known that the small polarons can arise from the strong lattice-electron interaction\noriginating from the Jahn-Teller distortion.24 This makes a strong correlation between the\nlattice constant and Ea. As mentioned above, the Vcell increases initially with x for\nlower-doped LSMRO, and then decreases with higher level of Ru substitution, as seen in\nFig. 2(b). It is apparent that both Ea and lattice constant exhibit similar variation with\nrespect to Ru concentration, suggesting that the polaronic mechanism should be appropriate\nfor the understanding of electrical transport in these LSMRO compounds.\n\nD. Heat capacity\n\nThe T-dependent specific heat (CP versus T) of LSMRO with x between 0 and 0.25 is\nillustrated in Figure 6. Each curve is offset by 30 (J/mol K) for clarity. Note that ac technique\ndoes not give the absolute value of specific heat without detailed knowledge of the power\nabsorbed from the light pulse. The absolute value of the specific heat above 130 K is\n9\n\n\fdetermined by measuring a powder sample (~200 mg) using a differential scanning\ncalorimetry (DSC). The ac results were corrected for their addendum heat capacities (GE\nvarnish and thermocouple wire) and normalized to the DSC data at 200 K. The overall\ntemperature-dependent specific heat of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (x = 0) is consistent with that reported\nby Khlopkin et al.27 It is found that the specific heat undergoes pronounced peaks due to the\nferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition in these compounds. The transition temperature\nTc,Cp, taken as the temperature of peak position, decreases with increasing Ru substitution level\nand is found to be consistently lower than TMI and TC, as shown in Table I. Several other\nreports also suggested that the transition temperature determined from different physical\nproperties may not be the same in these manganites.28\nThe specific-heat jumps \u2206CP and entropy change \u2206S near the transitions in LSMRO can\nbe estimated by subtracting a smooth lattice background fitted far away from the transition,\ndrawn as a solid curve in Fig. 6. The estimated \u2206CP decreases with increasing x, as shown in\nthe inset of Fig. 6. The corresponding entropy changes \u2206S, evaluated by integrating the area\nunder \u2206CP/T versus T curves, are also found to decrease with increasing x. A summary\nregarding the characteristics of the specific heat anomalies on LSMRO with 0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.25 is\ntabulated in Table I. Note that the entropy change (\u2206S=0.34 R) for the unsubstituted sample\nLa0.7Sr0.3MnO3\n\nis\n\nabout\n\nhalf\n\nthat\n\nof\n\nthe\n\ntheoretical\n\nvalue\n\nRln2\n\nfor\n\na\n\nferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition (R is the ideal gas constant). This discrepancy is\nascribed to the imhomogeneity of the sample, or partially canted spins in the ferromagnetic\nstate. A small shoulder is noticed around 365 K in the La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (x = 0) sample with our\nhigh-resolution ac calorimeter, again presumably owing to the sample imhomogeneity. Such a\nfeature is commonly seen in LSMO polycrystalline samples; however, it becomes essentially\ninvisible for the Ru substituted samples.\nThe T-dependent specific heat for high level of Ru substituted samples (x = 0.3 to x = 0.6)\nis shown in Fig. 7. In this figure each curve is offset by 10 (J/mol K) for clarity. It is clearly\n10\n\n\fseen that the transition temperature continuously decreases with increasing Ru substitution and\nthe pronounced peak in CP gradually evolves into a broad hump for x = 0.40, then a slope\nchange for x = 0.50. For the La0.7Sr0.3Mn0.4Ru0.6O3 (x = 0.6) sample, the anomalous feature is\nessentially undetectable in CP, being consistent with the observations by electrical resistivity\nmeasurement.\n\nE. Thermal conductivity\n\nFigure 8 shows the observed thermal conductivity (\u03ba) for LSMRO with 0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.25 .\nAs can be seen, the T-dependent thermal conductivity is almost independent of the value of\nx, except for the anomalous feature near phase transitions. The magnitude of \u03ba is found to\nbe between 10 to 40 mW/cm K in the temperature range we investigated, consistent with\nthe values seen by others.29,30 At low temperatures, \u03ba increases with temperature and a\nmaximum appears around 40 K for all studied samples. This is a typical feature for the\nreduction of thermal scattering in solids at low temperatures. With further increase in\ntemperature, \u03ba decreases with temperature due to the enhanced phonon-phonon scattering\n(Umklapp processes), then gradually saturate at high temperatures. Generally, the total\nthermal conductivity for ordinary metals and semimetals is a sum of electronic and lattice\nterms. The electronic thermal conductivity \u03bae can be evaluated using the Wiedemann-Franz\nlaw \u03ba e \u03c1 / T = L0 . Here \u03c1 is the dc electric resistivity and the Lorentz number L0 = 2.45 \u00d7\n10-8 W\u03a9K-2. From this estimation, it is found that the total thermal conductivity is mainly\nassociated with the lattice phonons rather than the charge carriers, due to the high electric\nresistivity of these perovskites.\nAs seen from Fig. 8, all samples show distinct anomalous feature due to the\noccurrence of the metal-insulator transition. The transition temperatures Tc,\u03ba, determined\nfrom the maximum of d\u03ba/dT, are also listed in Table I for comparison. The inset of Fig. 8\n\n11\n\n\fshows a blow-up plot near the phase transitions. Since the thermal conductivity\nmeasurements provide valuable information about the various scattering processes of\nthermal carriers, the present data allows us to probe into the interplay between the lattice,\ncharge, and spin degrees of freedom in these manganites. A common feature for the\nanomaly at Tc,\u03ba is that a sharp rise in \u03ba is observed when the samples enter the\nferromagnetic state. The anomalous part of thermal conductivity can be expressed as a\ncombination\n\nof\n\nelectronic,\n\nphonon,\n\nand\n\nmagnetic\n\ncontributions,\n\ni.e.,\n\n\u2206\u03ba = \u2206\u03ba e + \u2206\u03ba ph + \u2206\u03ba mag . The electronic term \u2206\u03ba e could be safely excluded from the\nexpression, since the contribution from charge carriers is insignificant as mentioned before.\nThe anomalous enhancement of thermal conductivity at transition could be attributed to the\nreduction of phonon-phonon scattering due to the Jahn-Teller distortions, which become\ndelocalized along with the charge carriers.31 However, Ikebe et al. have claimed that the\nphonon alone is far too small to explain the observed enhancement in \u03ba at ferromagnetic\ntransitions.29 Therefore, the magnetic contribution \u2206\u03ba mag must be taken into account. It is\nargued that a suppression of spin-phonon scattering may result from the strong coupling\nbetween the lattice and the spin system through the double exchange interaction.32 Another\npeculiar feature of the observed T-dependent thermal conductivity is that \u03ba increases\nmonotonically with temperature in the paramagnetic state (T > Tc,\u03ba). Such kind of behavior\nis very unusual, since the high-temperature thermal conductivity of crystalline solids is\nexpected to decrease with temperature according to the well-known formula \u03ba \u221d\n\naMC\u03b8 D\n,\n\u03b3 2T\n\nwhere a is the lattice constant, M is the mass per atom, C is the specific heat, \u03b8D is the\nDebye temperature, and \u03b3 is the Gruneisen constant with a value ranging from 2 to 3 for\nsolids. These parameters are considered to be a weak function of temperature at high\ntemperatures. As a result, \u03ba decreases with temperature through a reciprocal function of T.\nHowever, neutron scattering measurements in these manganites showed that the Gruneisen\n12\n\n\fconstant \u03b3 is not only much larger (~180) than usual, but also decreases markedly with\ntemperature.33 Thus, the increase in \u03ba in the paramagnetic state could be understood with\nthe scenario of local anharmonic lattice distortions.34\nF. Thermoelectric power\n\nThe temperature-dependent thermoelectric power (TEP) data for LSMRO with\n0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.25 are shown in Figure 9(a). The behavior of the TEP in these samples shows\n\nsmall and positive values at low temperatures, a signature of p-type conduction and metallic\nin nature. For all samples, it is seen that the measured TEP increases initially with T,\ndevelops into a broad maximum, then changes sign at higher temperatures. This sign\nchange in TEP implies that the electronic state of these samples has been thermally altered\nfrom hole-like to electron-like. With further increase in temperature, noticeable anomalous\nfeature, which marks the occurrence of phase transition, is clearly observed. The transition\ntemperatures Tc,TEP determined from the TEP data are tabulated in Table I. In addition to the\nsystematic decrease in Tc,TEP with respect to increasing x value, the temperatures with the\nsign change in TEP are found to decrease concurrently with Tc,TEP. Such an observation\nimplies that the sign change in TEP is closely related to the magnetic property in these\nmanganites, and can be attributed to the polaron transport, as discussed previously in\nresistivity. The spin polarization changes the electronic nature of charge carriers, and thus\nthe thermoelectric transport.32 Moreover, it is conventionally known that poor conductors\nusually have a larger TEP than that of good conductors and vice versa. Near Tc,TEP, a rapid\nincrease in the absolute value of TEP was observed, corresponding well to the\nmetal-insulator phase transition. For x = 0.10, a spike-shaped feature was observed in this\nparticular composition, indicating possible enhancement of double exchange interaction at\nthe low level of Ru substitution for Mn in these manganites. Note that the anomalous\nfeature in \u03ba was also more pronounced for the x = 0.10 sample (see inset of Fig. 9(a)),\nsupporting our previous argument.\n13\n\n\fIn the metallic region, the linear variation of TEP is often discussed using the\nwell-known Mott formula\nSe =\n\n\u03c0 2 k B 2 \u239b 1 \u2202\u03c3 ( E ) \u239e\n\u239f\u239f\nT \u239c\u239c\n,\n3e\n\u239d \u03c3 ( E ) \u2202E \u23a0 E = E\n\n(4)\n\nF\n\nby assuming a one-band model with an energy-independent relaxation time, where e is the\nelementary charge with a negative sign, and \u03c3(E) is the electrical conductivity. In the\ninsulating region, the TEP is given by the classical expression\nS=\u00b1\n\nkB\ne\n\n\u239e\n\u239b ES\n\u239c\u239c\n+ A \u239f\u239f ,\n\u23a0\n\u239d k BT\n\n(5)\n\nwhere ES is the activation energy for the thermoelectric power, and A is a constant of order\nunity. In Figure 9(b), we show a plot of TEP versus 1/T of these manganites and the solid lines\nrepresent the fits of measured data to Eq. (5) in the insulating phase. It is seen that the\nhigh-temperature TEP data can be satisfactorily described using such a thermal-activated\nmodel, and the extracted activation energy ES decreases with increasing x (see Table I). Such\nkind of ES dependence on x has also been found in the partially Cr substitution for the Mn sites\nin La0.67Ca0.33MnO3.34 It is worth mentioning that the activation energy Ea in the paramagnetic\nstate is previously estimated to be of the order of 0.1 eV from electrical resistivity data. If Eq.\n(5) is valid, the TEP for these samples should be of the order of 1000 \u03bcV/K, which is two\norders of magnitude larger than what we observed. With the fact that the thermoelectric power\nof this class of materials in the insulating phase is unexpectedly small, suggesting a\ncomparable size of electron-pockets and hole-pockets in their energy band and these\nmanganites are nearly compensated. Furthermore, the formation of polarons may also be\nessential to the thermoelectric transport in these materials.35\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn conclusion, we have reported detailed investigations of crystal structure, transport\n14\n\n\f(electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity, and thermoelectric power) and thermodynamic\n(magnetization and specific heat) properties on La0.7Sr0.3(Mn1-xRux)O3. Based on the\ncrystalline analyses and the magnetic-moment measurements, it is inferred that Ru should\nhave a mixed valence of Ru3+ and Ru4+ with lower level of Ru substitution (x < 0.5), and an\nadditional mixed valence of Ru4+ and Ru5+ appears in LSMRO with higher level of Ru\nsubstitution (x \u2265 0.5). It is found that all measured physical properties undergo pronounced\nanomalous features due to the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition in these\ncompounds. However, the Curie temperatures TC determined from the magnetization\nmeasurement are consistently higher than that of the metal-insulator transitions TMI determined\nfrom the transport measurements. By replacing Mn with Ru, both TC and TMI decrease\nconcurrently and the studied materials are driven toward the insulating phase with larger x.\nThe transport properties of LSMRO can be reasonably understood in the viewpoint of\npolaronic transport. It is also found that the entropy change during the phase transition is\nreduced with increase in Ru substitution. These observations indicate that the existence of Ru\nhas the effect of weakening the ferromagnetism and metallicity on the LSMRO perovskite.\nThe present study constitutes, by far, the most throughout physical measurements on full range\nof La0.7Sr0.3(Mn1-xRux)O3 manganites, and provides a significant understanding to the valence\nstate of Ru ions and transport mechanism for these compounds.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis work was supported by the National Science Council, Taiwan, Republic of China\nunder contract nos.
