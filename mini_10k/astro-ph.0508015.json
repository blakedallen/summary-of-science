Two structures in the all-particle energy spectrum of cosmic rays, the knee at 4 PeV\nand the second knee around 400 PeV are proposed to be explained by a phenomenological model,\nthe poly-gonato model, connecting direct and indirect measurements. Within this approach the\nknee is caused by a successive cut-off of the flux for individual elements starting with protons\nat 4.5 PeV. The second knee is interpreted as the end of the stable nuclei of the periodic table.\nTo check some key features of this model calculations of the cosmic ray energy spectrum and\nthe propagation path length at energies from 1014 to 1019 eV have been performed within the\nframework of a combined approach based on the diffusion model of cosmic rays and a direct\nsimulation of charged-particle trajectories in the Galaxy.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe all-particle energy spectrum of cosmic rays follows power laws over many orders of\nmagnitude in energy. The flux decreases from values of several 1000 (m2 sr s)\u22121 at GeV\nenergies to values below 0.01 (km2 sr a)\u22121 at energies exceeding 100 EeV. At a closer look\nsome structures are seen in the spectrum. In particular, the knee around 4 PeV, the second\nknee at about 400 PeV, and the ankle above 4 EeV [1, 2]. In many contemporary models for\ngalactic cosmic rays the knee is attributed to a cut-off for the flux of light elements at energies\nof several PeV, while the flux of heavier elements is supposed to continue to higher energies.\nAs explanations the maximum energy attained during the acceleration process, diffusive losses\nfrom the Galaxy, or interactions close to the source, during propagation, as well as within the\natmosphere are proposed [3].\nThe present work draws special attention on the second knee at energies around 400 PeV. The\nall-particle energy spectrum as obtained by several experiments is shown in Fig. 1 in the energy\nregion around the second knee. A change of the steepening of the average all-particle spectrum\naround 400 PeV is visible. In the following the possibility is explored, that this structure can be\ninterpreted as the end of the galactic cosmic-ray component. It should be pointed out that the\nposition of the second knee is found to be at about 92 \u00d7 \u00cap = 414 PeV, where \u00cap = 4.5 PeV is\nthe position of the proton knee [2]. In such a picture all stable elements known from the periodic\n1\nInvited talk, presented at the \"Workshop on Physics of the End of the Galactic Cosmic Ray Spectrum\", Aspen,\nUSA, April 25 - 29, 2005\n\n\f-1\n-2\n3\n\n+ Akeno\n\u2721 Fly's Eye\n+\nE(Z=92)\nHaverah Park\n+\n\u2295 +\n+\n\u2721\n+ ++\n\u2721\n\u2295\u2295\n+\n\u2721\u2295\u2721\u2295\n+\n\u2721\u2721\n+ +\n\u2721\u2721+ +\u2295+ +\n+\u2721\n\u2721\u2721 + + + + + + \u2721\n\u2295 \u2295 \u2721\u2721\n+\n+\n+ \u2721\u2721\n\u2295\u2721\u2721 \u2721 \u2721\n\u2721\u2721\n\u2295\u2721 \u2721\n+\n\u2295\n8\n1-2\n\n6\n\n2\n1-9\n-92\n29\n\n10\n\nRelative abundance (Fe\u22611)\n\n7\n\n-1\n\n2\n\nFlux d\u03a6/dE0 \u22c5 E0 [m sr s GeV ]\n\n10\n\n10\n\n8\n\n10\n\n9\n\n\u2295 HiRes/MIA\nYakutsk\n\n-3\n\n10\n\nARIEL 6\nFowler\nHEAO 3\nUHCRE\n\n\u2744\n-4\n\n10\n\n\u2744\n\n\u2744\u2744\u2744\n-5\n\n10\n-6\n\nSKYLAB\nTIGER\nTrek MIR\nTueller + Israel\nsol. syst.\n\n\u2744\u2744\n\u2744\n\u2744\u2744 \u2744\n\u2744\n\n10\n10\n\n-7\n-8\n\n10\n\n10\n\n30\n\n10\nEnergy E0 [ GeV ]\n\nFigure 1.

A cut-off for the individual elemental spectra for nuclei with charge number Z at\nenergies \u00caZ = Z * \u00cap is anticipated.\nThe sketched picture is based on the poly-gonato model. Its principle ideas are outlined in\nsect. 2. The model is a phenomenological approach connecting direct and indirect measurements\nof cosmic rays in the energy range from 1 GeV up to 1 EeV. The plausibility of some of its\ncharacteristic properties is checked by a detailed treatment of the propagation of cosmic rays in\nthe Galaxy. In sect. 3 the propagation of cosmic-ray particles in the magnetic field of the Galaxy\nis investigated within a diffusion model. Predictions are discussed for the energy spectrum,\nthe path length in the Galaxy, and the probability for a cosmic-ray particle to suffer nuclear\ninteraction during propagation. A summarizing discussion (sect. 4) closes the article.\n2. The Poly-Gonato Model\nThe basic idea of the poly-gonato model is to extrapolate the energy spectra as obtained by\ndirect measurements to higher energies and compare the sum of all elements to the all-particle\nspectrum observed with air shower experiments [2]. Within the model the measured energy\nspectra of individual elements are parametrized assuming power laws and taking into account\nthe solar modulation at low energies.\nAt energies in the GeV region the solar modulation of the energy spectra is described using\nthe parametrization\n\u0010\n\n4E\n\n\u22122.5*10\nE(E + 2mA ) E + M + 780 * e\nd\u03a6Z\n(E) = N\n*\ndE\nE+M\nE + M + 2mA\n\n\u0011\u03b3Z\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nadopted from [6].

A value M = 750 MeV is used\nfor the parametrization.\nAbove Z *10 GeV, the modulation due to the magnetic field of the heliosphere is negligible and\nthe energy spectra of cosmic\u2013ray nuclei are assumed to be described by power laws. However,\nextrapolating the elemental spectra with power laws, the all-particle spectrum obtained will\novershoot the measured all-particle spectrum above several PeV. Hence, a cut-off in the spectra\nfor the individual elements is introduced. Such a cut-off is motivated by various theories for the\norigin of the knee [3]. Inspired by such theories the following ansatz is adopted to describe the\nenergy dependence of the flux for particles with charge Z\n\"\n\nd\u03a6Z\n(E0 ) = \u03a60Z E0\u03b3Z 1 +\ndE0\n\nE0\n\u00caZ\n\n!\u01ebc # \u2212\u2206\u03b3\n\u01eb\nc\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\nThe absolute flux \u03a60Z and the spectral index \u03b3Z quantify the power law. The flux above the\ncut-off energy is modeled by a second and steeper power law. \u2206\u03b3 and \u01ebc characterize the change\nin the spectrum at the cut-off energy \u00caZ . Both parameters are assumed to be identical for all\nelements, \u2206\u03b3 being the difference in the spectral indices below and above the respective knees\nand \u01ebc describes the smoothness of the transition from the first to the second power law. To\nstudy systematic effects also a common spectral index for all elements above their respective\nknee has been tried, see [2].\nDifferent relations for the cut-off energy \u00caZ have been checked. The investigations showed\nthat a rigidity dependent cut-off with \u00caZ = \u00cap * Z, with the proton cut-off energy \u00cap , fits the\ndata best [2]. The all\u2013particle spectrum is obtained by summation of the flux d\u03a6Z /dE0 (E0 ) for\nall cosmic\u2013ray elements.\nThe absolute flux and the spectral indices for the elements from protons to nickel are derived\nfrom direct measurements above the atmosphere. For the heavier elements only abundances are\nknown at energies around 1 GeV/n. In Fig. 2 the relative abundance normalized to Fe \u2261 1 is\npresented as function of the nuclear charge number. One recognizes that all elements up to the\nend of the periodic table are present.

The expected spectra for\nelemental groups corresponding to these parameters are shown in Fig. 3. The all-particle\nspectrum obtained by summation of all elements fits the experimental values well. It can be\nrecognized that within this approach the knee is a consequence of the subsequential cut-offs\nfor the individual elemental spectra, starting with protons at 4.5 PeV. The shape of the allparticle spectrum above this energy is determined by the overlay of the individual cut-offs for\nall elements. The second knee is related to the cut-offs for the heaviest elements at the end of\nthe periodic table or the end of the galactic component.\nThe relative contributions of elemental groups to the all-particle spectrum are presented in\nFig. 4. The most dominant group is the iron group (Z = 25 \u2212 27), at energies around 70 PeV\nmore than 50% of the all-particle flux consists of these elements. Ultra heavy elements (Z \u2265 28)\nare expected to contribute at 300 PeV with slightly less than 40% to the all-particle flux.\nAround 300 PeV measurements of the average depth of the shower maximum (Xmax ) are\navailable from the Fly's Eye and HiRes experiments, see Fig. 5. These data are used to check\nthe predictions of the poly-gonato model. With the air shower simulation program CORSIKA\n[10] and a modified version of the hadronic interaction model QGSJET with lower cross sections\n[9] the expected Xmax distribution has been calculated. The composition of galactic cosmic rays\nhas been assumed according to the poly-gonato model. The resulting distribution is given in\nFig. 5 as solid histogram. It should be emphasized that this is not a fit to the measured Xmax\nvalues, instead, the fluxes are taken as predicted by the model. As can be inferred from the\nfigure, the left-hand side of the Xmax distribution is represented quite reasonably. An ad-hoc\ncomponent has been introduced to describe also the right-hand part of the distribution, for\ndetails see [9].\nIt should be pointed out that the three parameters of the model, namely \u00cap , \u01ebc , and \u2206\u03b3\nin eq. (2) have been determined by a fit to the all particle spectrum derived from indirect\nmeasurements. That means the flux values for individual elements in the region of their cutoff are real predictions of the model. A comparison of the predicted fluxes with the energy\nspectra for groups of elements as recently derived from air shower measurements shows a quite\n\n\fsatisfactory compatibility between the poly-gonato model and the measurements [3].\nTwo questions may rise when inspecting Fig. 3: Why are the spectra of heavy elements flatter\nthan the spectra for light elements? And: can there be a sufficient contribution of ultra heavy\nelements at energies around 108 GeV? To obtain a quantitative estimate on this items in the\nfollowing section the propagation of cosmic rays in the Galaxy is discussed.\n3. Propagation of Cosmic Rays in the Galaxy\nTo study cosmic-ray propagation in the Galaxy, a detailed knowledge of the structure of the\nmagnetic fields is essential. Unfortunately, the question about the configuration of the galactic\nmagnetic field remains open - different models exist based on experimental data [11, 12, 13, 14].\nHow cosmic rays are accelerated to extremely high energies is another unanswered question.\nAlthough the popular model of cosmic-ray acceleration by shock waves in the expanding shells\nof supernovae (see e.g. [15, 16, 17]) is almost recognized as \"standard theory,\" there are still a\nnumber of unresolved problems. Furthermore, the question about other acceleration mechanisms\nis not quite clear, and could lead to different cosmic-ray energy spectra at the sources [11].\nDifferent concepts are verified by the calculation of the primary cosmic-ray energy spectrum,\nmaking assumptions on the density of cosmic-ray sources, the energy spectrum at the sources,\nand the configuration of the galactic magnetic fields. The diffusion model can be used in the\nenergy range E < 1017 eV, where the energy spectrum is calculated using the diffusion equation\nfor the density of cosmic rays in the Galaxy. At higher energies this model ceases to be valid,\nand it becomes necessary to carry out numerical calculations of particle trajectories for the\npropagation in the magnetic fields of the Galaxy. This method works best for the highest\nenergy particles, since the time for the calculations required is inversely proportional to the\nparticle energy. Therefore, the calculation of the cosmic-ray spectrum in the energy range\n1014 \u2212 1019 eV has been performed within the framework of a combined approach, the use of a\ndiffusion model and the numerical integration of particle trajectories.\n3.1. Assumptions\nHigh isotropy and a comparatively long retention of cosmic rays in the Galaxy (\u223c 107 years for\nthe disk model) reveal the diffusion nature of particle motion in the interstellar magnetic fields.\nThis process is described by a corresponding diffusion tensor [11, 13, 18]. The steady-state\ndiffusion equation for the cosmic-ray density N (r) is (neglecting nuclear interactions and energy\nlosses)\n\u2212 \u2207i Dij (r)\u2207j N (r) = Q(r).\n(3)\nQ(r) is the cosmic-ray source term, Dij (r) is the diffusion tensor.\nUnder the assumption of azimuthal symmetry and taking into account the predominance of\nthe toroidal component of the magnetic field, eq. (3) is presented in cylindrical coordinates as\n\u0014\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n1 \u2202\n\u2202\n1 \u2202\nrD\u22a5\n\u2212\nD\u22a5\n\u2212\nDA\n+\nrDA\nN (r, z) = Q(r, z),\n\u2212\nr \u2202r\n\u2202r \u2202z\n\u2202z \u2202z\n\u2202r r \u2202r\n\u2202z\n\u0015\n\n(4)\n\nwhere N (r, z) is the cosmic-ray density averaged over the large-scale fluctuations with a\ncharacteristic scale L \u223c 100 pc [13]. D\u22a5 \u221d E m is the diffusion coefficient, where m is much less\nthan one (m \u2248 0.2), and DA \u221d E the Hall diffusion coefficient. The influence of Hall diffusion\nbecomes predominant at sufficiently high energies (> 1015 eV). The sharp enhancement of\nthe diffusion coefficient leads to the excessive cosmic-ray leakage from the Galaxy at energies\nE > 1017 eV. For investigating the cosmic-ray propagation at such energies it is necessary to\ncarry out calculations of the trajectories for individual particles.\nThe numerical calculation of trajectories is based on the solution of the equation of motion\nfor a charged particle in the magnetic field of the Galaxy.

Trajectories of cosmic rays were calculated until they left\nthe Galaxy. Testing the differential scheme used, it was found that the accuracy of the obtained\ntrajectories for protons with an energy E = 1015 eV after passing a distance of 1 pc amounts\nto 5 * 10\u22128 pc. The retention time of a proton with such an energy averages to about 10 million\nyears, hence, a total error for the trajectory approximation by the differential scheme is about\n0.5 pc.\nThe magnetic field of the Galaxy consists of a large-scale regular and a chaotic component\n~ =B\n~ reg + B\n~ irr .

The irregular field was constructed\naccording to an algorithm used in [19], that takes into account the correlation of the magnetic\nfield intensities in adjacent cells. The radius of the Galaxy is assumed to be 15 kpc and the\ngalactic disk has a half-thickness of 200 pc. The position of the Solar system was defined at\nr = 8.5 kpc, \u03c6 = 0\u25e6 , and z = 0 kpc. A radial distribution of supernovae remnants along the\ngalactic disk was considered as sources [20].\n3.2. Results\nThe results for the calculations of the cosmic-ray proton spectrum are presented in Fig. 6. These\nresults were obtained using the diffusion model and numerical calculations of trajectories. It is\nevident from the graph that both methods give identical results up to about 3 * 107 GeV. At\nhigher energies there is a continuous decrease of the intensity in the diffusion spectrum, which\ncorresponds to the excessive increase in the diffusion coefficient that leads to a large leakage of\nparticles from the Galaxy.\nAn energy of 1017 eV can be defined as the conventional boundary to apply the diffusion\nmodel. At this energy the results obtained with the two methods differ by a factor of two and\nfor higher energies the diffusion approximation becomes invalid.\nThe predicted spectra are compared to direct and indirect measurements of the primary\nproton flux in Fig. 7. In the depicted range there is almost no difference between the two\n\n\f1\n\n10\n\nAmplitude\n\n2\n\nPath length \u03bb [g/cm ]\n\n10\n\n\u03bbdif\n\u03bbrp\n\n-1\n\n\u03bblb\n\n\u03bbgc\n\n10-1\n\nMt.

The relatively steep decrease of the flux at energies exceeding 4 PeV is not reflected.\nOn the other hand, the data are described reasonably well by the poly-gonato model, as also\nshown in the figure. The observed change in the spectral index \u2206\u03b3 \u2248 2.1 according to the\npoly-gonato model has to be compared to the value predicted by the diffusion model. In the\nlatter the change should be 1 \u2212 m \u2248 0.8 [13]. The observed value is obviously larger, which\nimplies that the remaining change of the spectral shape should be caused by a change of the\nspectrum at the source, e.g. due to the maximum energy attained in the acceleration process.\nThe maximum energy and, therefore, the energy at which the spectrum steepens depends on\nthe intensity of the magnetic fields in the acceleration zone and on a number of assumptions\nfor the feedback of cosmic rays to the shock front. The uncertainty of the parameters yields\nvariations in the maximum energy predicted by different models up to a factor of 100 [3, 16].\nThus, there is no consensus about what the \"standard model\" is considered to predict. For\nthe time being, it is difficult to make definite conclusions from the comparison between the\nexperimental spectra for different elemental groups and the \"standard model\" of cosmic ray\nacceleration at ultra high energies.\nThe obtained path length (\u03bbdif ) in the Galaxy for protons as function of energy is presented\nin Fig. 8. The interstellar matter density was taken as nd = 1 cm\u22123 for the galactic disk and\nnh = 0.01 cm\u22123 for the halo. For heavier nuclei with charge Z the path length scales with the\nrigidity, i.e. is related to the values for protons \u03bb(E) as \u03bb(E, Z) = \u03bb(E/Z). At the corresponding\nknees, the amount of traversed material is less than 1 g/cm2 . The dashed dotted line indicates\na trend at lower energies according to \u03bb \u221d E \u2212\u03b4 . To reach values around 10 g/cm2 as obtained\naround 1 GeV, see below, one needs a relatively small slope \u03b4 \u2248 0.2 - much lower than the\nvalue usually assumed \u03b4 \u2248 0.6.\n\n\fFraction of surviving nuclei\n\n2\n\nInteraction length \u03bbint [g/cm ]\n\nZ=1\n\n10\nZ=8\nZ=26\nZ=92\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10\nEnergy E0 [GeV]\n\n1\n0.8\n\nHe\nBe\nO\n\n0.6\n\nSi\nFe\n\n0.4\n\nU\n\n0.2\n0\n\n10\n\nFigure 10.

Fraction of nuclei surviving\nwithout interaction in the Galaxy for different\nelements.\n\nMeasurements of the ratio of secondary to primary cosmic-ray nuclei at GeV energies are\nsuccessfully described using a leaky-box model. For example, assuming the escape path length\nas\n26.7\u03b2 g/cm2\n(6)\n\u03bblb =\n(\u03b2R/1.0 GV)0.58 + (\u03b2R/1.4 GV)\u22121.4\nvarious secondary to primary ratios obtained by the ACE/CRIS and HEAO-3 experiments can\nbe described consistently in the energy range from \u223c 70 MeV to \u223c 30 GeV [25]. A similar\napproach is the residual path length model [26], assuming the relation\n\u03bbrp\n\n\"\n\nR\n= 6.0 *\n10 GV\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\u22120.6\n\n#\n\n+ 0.013\n\ng/cm2\n\n(7)\n\nfor the escape path length. Both examples are compared to the predictions of the diffusion\nmodel in Fig. 8.\nExtrapolating these relations to higher energies, the strong dependence of the path length on\nenergy (\u221d E \u22120.6 ) leads to extremely small values at PeV energies. Above 105 GeV the traversed\nmatter would be less than the matter accumulated along a straight line from the galactic center\nto the solar system \u03bbgc = 8 kpc * 1 proton/cm3 \u2248 0.04 g/cm2 . This value is indicated in Fig. 8\nas dotted line.\nA similar conclusion can be derived from anisotropy measurements. Rayleigh amplitudes\nobserved by different experiments are compiled in Fig. 9 [22]. Leaky-box models, with their\nextremely steep decrease of the path length \u03bb \u221d E \u22120.6 , yield relative large anisotropies even at\nmodest energies, which seem to be ruled out by the measurements. Two versions of a leaky-box\nmodel [23], with and without reacceleration are represented in the figure. On the other hand,\na diffusion model [24], which is based on the same basic idea [13] as the present work, seems to\nbe compatible with the measured data. For this model the expected Rayleigh amplitudes are\ngiven for primary protons and iron nuclei, as well as for a mixture of all elements.\nUsing nuclear cross sections according to the hadronic interaction model QGSJET [27] and\nassuming a number density np = 1 proton/cm3 in the galactic disk, the interaction length of\n\n\fnuclei has been calculated. The results for four different elements are presented in Fig. 10. The\nvalues decrease slightly as function of energy. Values for protons are in the range 20 \u2212 55 g/cm2 ,\nthe values decrease as function of nuclear charge and reach values < 1 g/cm2 for the heaviest\nelements.\nThe interaction probability for different nuclei has been calculated based on the obtained path\nlength and interaction parameters according to the QGSJET model. Nuclear fragmentation is\ntaken into account in an approximate approach [28]. It should be pointed out that a nuclear\nfragment conserves the trajectory direction of its parent if Z/A in question is the same as for the\nprimary nucleus and for most stable nuclei the ratio Z/A is close to 1/2. The resulting fraction\nof nuclei which survive without an interaction is presented in Fig. 11 for selected elements. It\nturns out that at the respective knees (Z * 4.5 PeV) more than about 50% of the nuclei survive\nwithout interactions, even for the heaviest elements. This is an important result, since the\npoly-gonato model relates the contribution of ultra-heavy cosmic rays to the second knee in the\nall-particle spectrum around 400 PeV. It should be noted that the fraction of surviving nuclei\nwould be even larger for a leaky-box model, with its low path length at such energies.\n4. Discussion\nThe energy spectrum of cosmic rays at their source Q(E) is related to the observed values at\nEarth N (E) as\n\u0013\u22121\n\u0012\n1\n1\n+\n(8)\nN (E) = Q(E)\n\u03bbesc (E) \u03bbint (E)\nwith the propagation path length \u03bbesc and the interaction length \u03bbint . The corresponding values\nare presented in Fig. 8 and Fig. 10, respectively. It is frequently assumed that the propagation\npath length decreases as function of energy \u03bblb \u221d E \u22120.6 , as discussed above. Since the interaction\nlength is almost independent of the primary energy this necessitates a spectrum at the sources\nQ(E) \u221d E \u22122.1 to explain the observed spectrum at Earth N (E) \u221d E \u22122.7 . However, the model\nby Berezhko et al [16] predicts even flatter spectra at the sources before the knee and an even\nstronger dependence of \u03bbesc on energy is needed. Recent measurements of the TeV \u03b3 ray flux\nfrom a shell type supernova remnant yield a spectral index \u03b3 = \u22122.19 \u00b1 0.09 \u00b1 0.15 [29] in\nagreement with the \"standard model\". However, e.g. for the Crab Nebula a steeper spectrum\nwith \u03b3 = \u22122.57 \u00b1 0.05 has been obtained [30], indicating that not all sources exhibit the same\nbehaviour.\nAs has been discussed above, the dependence of the propagation path length \u03bbesc \u221d E \u22120.6\ncan not be extrapolated to knee energies. Taking a value \u03bbesc \u221d E \u22120.2 as discussed in relation\nwith Fig. 8 necessitates additional assumptions on the spectral shape Q(E) at the source in\norder to explain the observed spectra with spectral indices in the range \u2212\u03b3 \u2248 2.55 \u2212 2.75 [2].\nDirect measurements seem to indicate that the spectra of light elements are flatter as\ncompared to heavy elements [2]. The values of \u03bbint for protons are at all energies larger than the\nescape path length \u03bbdif . Hence, for protons the escape from the Galaxy is the dominant process\ninfluencing the shape of the observed energy spectrum. For iron nuclei at low energies hadronic\ninteractions are dominating (\u03bbint \u2248 2 g/cm2 < \u03bbdif ) and leakage from the Galaxy becomes\nimportant at energies approaching the iron knee (26 \u00d7 \u00cap ). However, for elements heavier than\niron the interaction path length is smaller than the escape path length for all energies, except\nabove the respective knees. At low energies the propagation path length exceeds the interaction\npath length by about an order of magnitude. For these elements nuclear interaction processes\nare dominant for the shape of the observed spectrum. This may explain why energy spectra\nfor heavy elements should be flatter as compared to light nuclei. In particular, the ultra-heavy\nelements suffer significantly from interactions at low energies.\nIn summary, the results obtained show the effectiveness of the combined method to\ncalculate the cosmic-ray spectrum using a numerical calculation of trajectories and a diffusion\n\n\fapproximation. The calculated dependence of the propagation path length on energy suggests\nthat the difference between the predicted spectral index at the source (\u03b3 \u2248 \u22122.1) in the \"standard\nmodel\" and the experimental value (\u03b3 \u2248 \u22122.7) can not be explained by the energy dependence\nof the escape path length solely. The compatibility of the observed cosmic-ray energy spectrum\nwith the \"standard model\" requires additional assumptions. Most likely, it can be concluded\nthat the knee in the energy spectrum of cosmic rays has its origin in both, acceleration and\npropagation processes.\nIn the poly-gonato model the knee in the energy spectrum at 4.5 PeV is caused by a cut-off\nof the light elements and the spectrum above the knee is determined by the subsequent cut-offs\nof all heavier elements at energies proportional to their nuclear charge number. The second knee\naround 400 PeV \u2248 92 * \u00cap is due to the cut-off of the heaviest elements in galactic cosmic rays.\nConsidering the calculated escape path length and nuclear interaction length within the diffusion\nmodel, it seems to be reasonable that the spectra for heavy elements are flatter as compared to\nlight elements. The calculations show also that even for the heaviest elements at the respective\nknee energies more than 50% of the nuclei survive the propagation process without interactions.\nThis may explain why ultra-heavy elements are expected to contribute significantly (\u223c 40%) to\nthe all-particle flux at energies around 400 PeV.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are grateful to J.
