Accurate mass determinations of B\u2013type stars still are urgently\nrequired, since actual masses are based on a very small number of eclipsing\nbinaries. Data of this kind are important for tests of stellar models, with farreaching implications such as modelling of stellar components of galaxies. Our\nmain motivations to study this system to explain the nature of the B-star\nbinary HD 194495. This effort is part of an ongoing research to determine the\nmasses and radii of such systems.\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier\n\n15 June 2018\n\n\fThe star HD 194495 was classified as B7 V single-lined, massive spectroscopic\nbinary by Monet (1979). System consists of an evolved, more massive, and\nmore luminous primary component and a main sequence secondary star. It has\nan eccentric orbit (e=0.14) and an orbital period of 4.90 days. Several radial\nvelocity measurements of primary component of HD 194495 by Monet (1979)\nshow range from -80 km s\u22121 to 100 km s\u22121 , but no further investigations were\nmade into this probable velocity variable and radial velocity of the second\ncomponent measurements. The eclipsing nature of its light curve was first noticed with the Hipparcos satellite (HIP 100719) and later ASAS photometric\nsurvey (ASAS 202511+2129.3) where it was classified as an unsolved variables\neclipsing binary and known as V399 Vulpecula (Kazarovets et al., 1999).\nAs one of only a few eclipsing B-star binary HD 194495 provides a potentially\nimportant system because it is a test case for stellar structure and evolution\nmodels. It is critical that well-determined values for the current separation and\ncomponent masses be determined. In this paper, we use the optical spectra of\nHD 194495 to reveal the nature of its light variability and physical properties\nin combination with the photometric data obtained by Hipparcos and ASAS3 as well as with the our reconstruction of spectra. The paper is organized\nas follows. In \u00a72 the spectroscopic observations, data analysis, temperature\nestimations, reddening and reconstruction of spectra are described. Derived\nabsolute parameters of the stars from the combination spectroscopic and photometric results are given in \u00a73. We compare the individual masses based on\nthe spectroscopic and photometric orbits to those predicted by theoretical\nmethods and discuss their implications in \u00a74.\n\n2\n\nSpectroscopic observations\n\nSpectroscopic observations have been performed with the \u00e9chelle spectrograph\n(FRESCO) at the 91-cm telescope of Catania Astrophysical Observatory. The\nspectrograph is fed by the telescope through an optical fibre (UV \u2013NIR, 100\n\u03bcm core diameter) and is located, in a stable position, in the room below\nthe dome level. Spectra were recorded on a CCD camera equipped with a\nthinned back\u2013illuminated SITe CCD of 1k\u00d71k pixels (size 24\u00d724 \u03bcm). The\ncross-dispersed \u00e9chelle configuration yields a resolving power R=\u03bb/\u03b4\u03bb=22 000,\nas deduced from the full width at half maximum of the lines of the Th\u2013Ar\ncalibration lamp. The spectra cover the wavelength range from 4300 to 6650\n\u00c5, split into 19 orders. In this spectral region, and in particular in the blue\nportion of the spectrum, there are several lines useful for the measure of radial\nvelocity, as well as for spectral classification of the stars.\n2\n\n\fCorrelation\n\nShift (km s-1)\nFig. 1. Sample of Cross Correlation Functions between HD 194495 and the radial\nvelocity template spectrum in first and second quadrature phase. The horizontal\naxis is relative radial velocities, and vertical axis is normalized cross-correlation\namplitude. Note that splittings at stronger peaks. The phases of observations and\nthe wavelength of the peak centers of the primary (thick bar) and secondary (thin\nbar) component are also marked.\n\nThe data reduction was performed by using the \u00e9chelle task of IRAF 1 package\nfollowing the standard steps: background subtraction, division by a flat field\nspectrum given by a halogen lamp, wavelength calibration using the emission lines of a Th-Ar lamp, and normalization to the continuum through a\npolynomial fit.\nSeventeen spectra of HD 194495 were collected during the 20 observing nights\nbetween August 14 and September 22, 2007. Typical exposure times for the\nHD 194495 spectroscopic observations were between 2400 and 2600 s. The\nsignal-to-noise ratio (S/N) achieved was between 70 and 120, depending on\natmospheric condition. \u03b1 Lyr (A0V), 59 Her (A3IV), \u03b9 Psc (F7V), HD 27962\n(A2IV), and \u03c4 Her (B5IV) were observed during each run as radial velocity\nand/or rotational velocity templates. The average S/N at continuum in the\nspectral region of interest was 150\u2013200 for the standard stars.\n\n1\n\nIRAF is distributed by the National Optical Observatory, which is operated by\nthe Association of the Universities for Research in Astronomy, inc.

For this purpose the\nIRAF task fxcor was used.\nFigure 1 shows example of CCF at first and second quadrature phase. The two\npeaks correspond to each component of HD 194495. The stronger peaks in each\nCCF correspond to the more luminous component that have a larger weight\ninto the observed spectrum. We adopted a two-Gaussian fit algorithm to re4\n\n\fsolve cross-correlation peaks near the second quadrature when spectral lines\nare visible separately. At this phase, absorption lines of the primary and secondary components of the system can be easily recognized in the range between\n4300-6800 \u00c5. These regions include the following lines: He i 4387 \u00c5, Mg ii 4481\n\u00c5, He i 4713, He i 5016 \u00c5, He i 4917 \u00c5, He i 5876 \u00c5. We limited our analysis\nto the echelle orders in the spectral domains in the range, which include several photospheric absorption lines. We have disregarded very broad lines like\nH\u03b1 , H\u03b2 and H\u03b3 because their broad wings affect the CCF and lead to large\nerrors. A double-lined Gaussian fit was used to disentangle the CCF peaks\nand determine the RVs of each component. Following the method proposed\nby Penny et al. (2001) we first made two-Gaussian fits of the well separated\nCCFs using the deblending procedure in the IRAF routine splot. The average\nfitted FWHM is 234\u00b18 and 178\u00b19 km s\u22121 for the primary and secondary components, respectively. In Figure 1 we show a sample of double-Gaussian fit.\nIndeed, the shapes and velocities corresponding to the peaks of the CCFs are\nslightly changed. By measuring the areas enclosed by the Lorentzian profiles\nof the spectral lines belonging to the primary (A1 ) and secondary (A2 ) we\nestimate the light ratio of the primary star (F1 ) to the secondary (F2 ). In this\nway, we were able to obtain an estimate of the monochromatic flux ratio in\nthe red and blue part of the spectra of F1 /F2 \u223cA1 /A2 =0.63 based upon the\nrelative line depths of the spectral components.\n\n2.1.1 Resulting radial velocities\nThe resulting radial velocities are listed in Table 1 together with their standard errors. The observational points and their error bars are displayed in\nFigure 2 as a function of orbital phase as calculated by means of the ephemeris\n(equation 1) and fixed it during the orbital solutions. Other parameters, such\nas the velocity semi-amplitude of the components (K1,2 ), systemic velocity\n(V\u03b3 ), longitude of periastron (\u03c9), orbital eccentricity (e), and time of periastron passage (T0 ) were converged. The final solution gave K1 =116\u00b14 km\ns\u22121 , K2 =161\u00b16 km s\u22121 , V\u03b3=-15\u00b11 km s\u22121 , \u03c9=2.72\u00b10.09, and e=0.12\u00b10.07.\nOur spectroscopic mass ratio is q=M2 /M1 =0.72. Hence, our analysis gives the\nfollowing parameters: M1 sin3 i=6.16\u00b10.05 M\u2299 , M2 sin3 i=4.44\u00b10.06 M\u2299 , and\na sin i=26.68\u00b10.01 R\u2299 .\n\n2.2 Spectral classification and temperature estimates\n\nWe have used the spectra to reveal the spectral type of the primary component\nof HD 194495. For this purpose we have measured the equivalent widths (EW )\nof photospheric absorption lines for the spectral classification (Table 2). We\nhave followed the procedures described by Hern\u00e1ndez et al. (2004), choosing\n5\n\n\fFig. 2. Radial velocity curve folded on a period of 4.904938 days. Points with error\nbars (error bars are masked by the symbol size in some cases) show the radial\nvelocity measurements for the components of the system (primary: filled circles,\nsecondary: open circles).\nTable 2\nEquivalent widths of the selected lines in the spectra.\nSpectral lines\n\nEWprimary (\u00c5)\n\nHe i + Fe i \u03bb 4922\n\n0.26\u00b10.11\n\nH\u03b3 \u03bb 4349\n\n0.37\u00b10.11\n\nHe i \u03bb 5876\n\n0.35\u00b10.13\n\nHe i+Fe i \u03bb 4387\n\n0.35\u00b10.21\n\nH\u03b2 4861\n\n5.31\u00b10.42\n\nhydrogen and helium lines in the whole wavelength region, where the contribution of the primary component is considerably larger than that of the\nsecondary in the spectra. From the calibration relations of EW \u2013Spectral-type\ngiven by Hern\u00e1ndez et al. (2004), we have derived a spectral type of B3\u00b11 for\nthe primary component. The effective temperature deduced from the calibrations of Drilling & Landolt (2000), and de Jager & Nieuwenhuijzen (1987) is\n18 600\u00b1650 and 19 100\u00b1680 K for the primary component, respectively. The\nmean effective temperature of the primary component deduced from the spectra is therefore 19 000\u00b1550 K .\nHD 194495 is listed in several large photometric databases consolidated in the\nHipparcos Catalogue, which provide optical magnitudes of B=7m .09\u00b10m .02,\nV=7m .07\u00b10m .01. Since the magnitudes collected from photometric measure6\n\n\fments and the colors are inconsistent no attempt has been made to calculate the effective temperatures of the components. The infrared magnitudes are taken from 2MASS (Cutri et al., 2003) catalog as J=7m .159\u00b10m .009,\nH=7m .221\u00b10m .017, and K=7m .249\u00b10m .011. The observed infrared colours of\nJ-H=-0m .162\u00b10m .031 and H-K=-0m.028\u00b10m .018 correspond to a combined\nspectral type of B2\u00b12 is an agreement with that we derived by spectral lines\nalone. Hence V-K, J-H and H-K colors of the primary component corresponds\nto a spectral type of B2\u00b11.\n2.3 Reddening\nThe measurement of reddening is a key step in determining the absolute temperature scale (and therefore the distance) of eclipsing binaries. In addition\nto moderate distance determined by the Hipparcos mission, some reddening is\nexpected for HD 194495 due to its low galactic latitude (l=63\u25e6 .03, b = \u22129\u25e6 .34).\nOur spectra cover the interstellar Nai (5890 and 5896 \u00c5) doublets, which is\nexcellent estimators of the reddening as demonstrated by Munari & Zwitter\n(1997). They calibrated a tight relation linking the Na i D2 (5890 \u00c5) and\nKi (7699 \u00c5) equivalent widths with the E(B-V) reddening. On spectra obtained at quadratures, lines from both components are un-blended with the\ninterstellar ones, which can therefore be accurately measured. We derive an\nequivalent width of 0.21\u00b10.03 \u00c5 for only Nai, which corresponds to E(B-V)=\n0m .08\u00b10m .02. Ki interstellar line is out of our spectral range as given in wavelength region in previous section.\n2.4 Rotational velocity and reconstruction of spectra\nThe width of the cross-correlation profile is a good tool for the measurement\nof v sin i (see, e.g., Queloz et al. (1998)). The rotational velocities (v sin i) of\nthe two components were obtained by measuring the FWHM of the CCF\npeaks in ten high-S/N spectra of HD 194495 acquired close to the quadratures, where the spectral lines have the largest Doppler-shifts. In order to construct a calibration curve FWHM\u2013v sin i, we have used an average spectrum of\nHD 27962, acquired with the same instrumentation. Since the rotational velocity of HD 27962 is very low but not zero (v sin i \u224311 km s\u22121 , e.g., Royer et al.\n(2002)), it could be considered as a useful template rotating faster than v sin i\n\u2243 10 km s\u22121 . The spectrum of HD 27962 was synthetically broadened by convolution with rotational profiles of increasing v sin i in steps of 5 km s\u22121 and\nthe cross-correlation with the original one was performed at each step. The\nFWHM of the CCF peak was measured and the FWHM-v sin i calibration was\nestablished. The v sin i values of the components of HD 194495 were derived\n7\n\n\fFig. 3. Observed spectrum of HD 194495 (large dots) in the Mg ii \u03bb4481. The synthetic spectrum (B3V+B4V) is displayed with continuous line in the same boxes.\nThe differences (observed-synthetic, shifted) are plotted in the bottom of panel.\n\nfrom the FWHM of their CCF peak and the aforementioned calibration relations, for a few wavelength regions and for the best spectra. This gave values\nof 61\u00b15 km s\u22121 for the primary star and 39\u00b17 km s\u22121 for the secondary star.\nWe performed an accurate spectral classification and measured rotational velocities of the components in order to search for the best combination of the\ntwo standard-star spectra able to reproduce the observed spectrum of the\nHD 194495. From the observed two standard star spectra of, acquired with\nthe same instrumentation, \u03c4 Her and \u03b1 Lyr are used as standard stars for the\nprimary and secondary, respectively. For the construction of the reproduced\nobserved spectrum of the system the spectra of the \u03c4 Her (B5IV) and \u03b1 Lyr\n(A0V) have been rotationally broadened by convolution with the appropriate\nrotational profile and then have co-added, properly weighted by using physical\nparameters (T1 , T2 , R1 , R2 , v1,2 sini) of the components as input parameters\nand Doppler-shifted according to the radial velocity solution derived in next\nsection.\nFigure 3 shows the reconstructed spectra for the primary and secondary with\nthe best fit spectra overplotted. The relative depths of He i \u03bb4471 and Mg ii\n\u03bb4481 are good temperature indicators throughout the B-star sequence (Williams ,\n2009) plus the H\u03b3 line that is sensitive to gravity (linear stark effect). Specifically, the He i \u03bb4471 line gets weaker while the Mg ii \u03bb4481 line gets stronger\nas temperature decreases.\nThe resolving power of the instrument is unsuitable for attempting classical\nspectral typing. However, we can arrive at an estimate of the spectral types for\neach components in the HD 194495 system by comparing the derived effective\ntemperatures in \u00a72.2 and \u00a73. According to the Table 2 of B\u00f6hm-Vitense (1981)\nthe effective temperature and gravity of the primary of HD 194495 is most\nconsistent with a B3 IV-V star while the secondary matches most closely with\na B4 V star, and these classifications are listed in Table 3.\n8\n\n\fTable 3\nSpectroscopic reconstruction parameters of the components.\nParameter\n\nPrimary\n\nSecondary\n\nSpectral Type\n\nB3 IV-Va\n\nB4 Va\n\n19 000\u00b1320\n\n18 250\u00b1520\n\n3.79\u00b10.25\n\n4.18\u00b10.25\n\n61\u00b15\n\n39\u00b17\n\nTef f (K)\nlog g (cgs)\nvsini (km s\u22121 )\nF1 /F2\n\na\n\n3\n\n0.63\u00b10.12\n\nThe spectral types are estimated from derived values of Tef f and log g.\n\nCombined radial velocity and light curve solution\n\n3.1 The binary ephemeris\n\nStudying of the light curves was achieved on the basis of three different photometric data sets [Tycho BT and VT photometry, Hp -band data of Hipparcos\nand V-band data of ASAS3 (Pojmanski, 2002)]. Meaningfully photometric\nobservations of HD 194495 were made by the Hipparcos mission and 78 Hp\nmagnitudes were listed by van Leeuwen (2007). These magnitudes were obtained in a time interval of about three years. The accuracy of the Hipparcos\ndata is about \u03c3Hp \u223c 0.01. These measurements are plotted against the orbital\nphase in the bottom panel of Figure 4. In spite of their low precision, the Hipparcos and Tycho data clearly show light variation when the observations are\nphased with the ephemeris, limited by the lack of observations in the primary\nand secondary minima and by insufficient sensitivity.\nThe All Sky Automated Survey database contains light curves for \u223c39 000\npreviously unknown variable stars. We extracted the V-band light curve for\nHD 194495 (ASAS 202511+2129.3) from this catalog, removing points deemed\nlower quality by the data reduction pipeline used by the ASAS. The 238 photometric measurements of ASAS, including eclipses, were used to determine\nthe light-curve elements. All available photometric data are phased and rescaled in Figure 4. It is clear from Figure 4 that HD 194495 is an eccentric\nbinary, with the secondary eclipse at phase 0.44 relative to the primary eclipse\nat phase 0.00. The scatter of the data in the out-of-eclipse phases was about\n0m .03.\nThe ASAS photometry permits determination of only one seasonal moment\nof primary eclipse, but this enable us to obtain an improved primary eclipse\n9\n\n\fRelative Flux\n\nASAS3\n\nHipparcos\n\nOrbital Phase\n\nFig. 4.

For the analysis, combined light curves of three data\nset was modelled. Considering the spectroscopic analysis the temperature of\nthe primary was fixed to 19 000 K, and the bolometric albedo and gravity\nbrightening coefficients were set to unity, as generally found for stars with the\nradiative envelopes (von Zeipel, 1924).

The mass ratio, eccentricity and longitude of periastron were\ndetermined from the radial velocity analysis was kept as a fix value. The\niterations were carried out automatically until convergence and a solution was\ndefined as the set of parameters for which the differential corrections were\nsmaller than the probable errors. The combined light curve was analized and\nthe weighted means of the parameters i, T2 , \u03a91 , \u03a92 , r1 and r2 were computed.\nOur final results are listed in Table 4 and the computed light curves are shown\nas continuous lines in Figure 4. The uncertainities assigned to the adjusted\nparameters are the internal errors provided directly by the Wilson-Devinney\ncode.\n11\n\n\fTable 5\nFundamental parameters of HD 194495.\nHD 194495\nParameter\n\nPrimary\n\na (R\u2299 )\n\nSecondary\n28.58\u00b11.12\n\nV\u03b3 (km s\u22121 )\n\n-15\u00b11\n\nq\n\n0.723\u00b10.003\n\nMass (M\u2299 )\n\n7.57\u00b10.08\n\n5.46\u00b10.03\n\nRadius (R\u2299 )\n\n5.82\u00b10.03\n\n3.14\u00b10.08\n\nlog g (cgs)\n\n3.50\u00b10.02\n\n3.54\u00b10.03\n\nTef f (K)\n\n19 000\u00b1550\n\n17 800\u00b1600\n\n(vsin i)obs (km s\u22121 )\n\n61\u00b12\n\n39\u00b14\n\n(vsin i)calc.

The\nstandard deviations of the parameters have been determined by JKTABSDIM 2 code, which calculates distance and other physical parameters using\nseveral different sources for bolometric corrections (Southworth et al., 2005).\nThe mass and radii of the components were estimated with uncertainities of\n1 %.\nAn inspection of the temperatures, masses and radii of the component stars\n2\n\nThis can be obtained from http://www.astro.keele.ac.uk/\u223cjkt/codes.html\n\n12\n\n\fFig. 5. Positions of the components of the system in HR diagram are plotted.\nThe solid lines evolutionary tracks for stars of various masses from Schaller et al.\n(1992) and isochrones (vertical dashed lines) from Lejeune & Schaerer (2001) for\nsolar metallicity with ages of 20, 25, 28, and 32 Myr going from left to right. The\npositions of the components are consistent with an age of \u223c 28 Myr.\n\nreveals a binary system composed of two main-sequence stars. The temperature Tef f 1 = 19 000 K, mass M1 = 7.58 M\u2299 and radius R1 = 5.8 R\u2299 of\nthe primary are consistent with the spectral type of B3, and the temperature Tef f 2 = 17 800 K, mass M2 = 5.46 M\u2299 and radius R2 = 3.1 R\u2299 of the\nsecondary are consistent with an B4V spectral type star.\nUsing the two E(B \u2212 V ) values derived from photometric and spectroscopic\ndata we calculated the de\u2013reddening distance modulus of the system. To estimate the bolometric magnitudes of the components we adopted Mbol =4.74\nmag for the Sun. Using the bolometric corrections given by Drilling & Landolt\n(2000) and Girardi et al. (2002) we estimate the distance to the system as 274\nand 269 pc, respectively, with an uncertainity of 5 pc. However, the average\ndistance to the system is estimated to be 290+42\n\u221229 pc from the trigonometric\nparallax measured by the Hipparcos mission.\nTo compare the distance of HD 194495 using a different method we used a\nluminosity-colour relation (Bilir et al., 2008), which has been constructed for\nbinary systems with main-sequence components. This method calculates the\ncolor excess (Ed (B \u2212 V )) in the direction and the distance of the HD 194495\nusing Schlegel et al. (1998) maps (see details in Bilir et al. (2008)). The re13\n\n\fduced color excess in direction of the HD 194495 is calculated Ed (B-V)=0.072.\nThe near-infrared magnitudes of the system were taken from the 2MASS Point\nSources Catalogue of Cutri et al. (2003) and are shown in Table 5.\nThe colour excess E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.08 was estimated in direction of HD 194495\nby using equivalenth width of the interstellar lines. The near-infrared absolute\nmagnitude of HD 194495 system was estimated by the luminosity-colour relation, MJ = 5.228(J \u2212 H)o + 6.185(H \u2212 Ks )0 + 0.608, of Bilir et al. (2008) and\nthe distance of the system is calculated as 274\u00b18 pc by using the photometric\nparallaxes method. The photometric distance of 274\u00b18 pc given in Table 5 is\nconsistent with the 269\u00b18 pc and 290\u00b18 pc distance estimated by studiying\nof the interstellar lines and the Hipparcos measurements, respectively.\n\n4.2 Evolutionary stage and age of the system\n\nWe have presented the results of the masses and radii of the stars in the\nHD 194495 system to great accuracy and also a photometric solution of the\nsystem. The results of the light and radial velocity curves analysis of the\nallows to derive the absolute parameters of the system. We have determined\nthe masses and radii of the two stars to 1% for the primary and secondary\nstar. The resulting parameters of HD 194495 are given in Table 5. As is seen\nin Table 5, both stars of the system are well within their Roche radii but\nexperience tidal distortion that is evident in the V-band light curve (Figure 4).\nThe rotational velocities derived from the reconstructions (Table 3) very well\nmatch with the synchronous rotation values found from analysis. Therefore,\nthis system has achieved synchronous rotation, and is not very young.\nIn order to discuss the evolutionary status of the components of the system,\nthe locations of two stars were plotted on Hertzsprung \u2013 Russell (HR) diagram. In this HR diagram (Figure 5) plotted against evolutionary tracks for\nstars of 5, 7, and 9 M\u2299 from Schaller et al. (1992), as well as isochrones from\nLejeune & Schaerer (2001) for solar metallicity with ages of 20, 25, 28, and\n32 Myr. The location of the stars is most consistent with an age of \u223c 28 Myr.\nThe positions of the components of the system appear in Figure 5 to be overluminous for the derived masses of M1 = 7.6 M\u2299 for the primary and M1 = 5.5\nM\u2299 for the secondary. Table 15.7 of Tokunaga (1991) gives the astrophysical\nparameters for stars of the various spectral classes. The mass and effective\ntemperature of the primary fit between the listed values for spectral types B3\n(7.6 M\u2299 ) and B4 (\u223c 6.8 M\u2299 ), but the radius is much larger than the means\nfor comparable spectral types and matches a B3 star (4.8 R\u2299 ). Hilditch et al.\n(2005) found several systems of comparable mass that, like HD 194495, are\noverluminous compared with model predictions for eclipsing binaries in the\nSmall Magellanic Cloud (SMC) . However, the results for HD 194495 seem\n14\n\n\fto conflict with the results of Malkov (2003), who showed that early B-type\nstars that are in close systems and rotate more slowly than single stars are on\naverage smaller than those same single stars. Malkov (2007) also studied well\nseparated binaries in an effort to use the properties of their component stars\nfor a more direct comparison with single stars. The mass\u2013luminosity\u2013radius\nrelations in his study, when applied to our results for HD 194495, predict lessluminous, hotter, and smaller components. This is perhaps not surprising, due\nto the age of HD 194495 and the evolution of its components from the zero-age\nmain sequence.\nTo study the kinematical properties of HD 194495, we used the system's centerof-mass' velocity, distance and proper motion values, which are given in Table\n5. The proper motion data were taken from newly reduced Hipparcos catalogue (van Leeuwen, 2007), whereas the center-of-mass velocity and distance\nare obtained in this study. The system's space velocity was calculated using\nJohnson & Soderblom (1987) algorithm. The U, V and W space velocity components and their errors were obtained and given in Table 5. To obtain the\nspace velocity precisely the first-order galactic differential rotation correction\nwas taken into account (Mihalas & Binney, 1981), and -1.08 and 0.65 kms\u22121\ndifferential corrections were applied to U and V space velocity components,\nrespectively. The W velocity is not affected in this first-order approximation.\nAs for the LSR correction, Mihalas & Binney (1981) values (9, 12, 7)\u2299 kms\u22121\nwere used and the final space velocity of HD 194495 was obtained as S = 43\nkms\u22121 . This value is in agreement with other young stars space velocities given\nin the criterion from Leggett (1992) for young disc stars -50 \u2264 U \u2264 20, -30\n\u2264 V \u2264 0, -25 \u2264 W \u2264 10.\nTo determine the population type of HD 194495 the galactic orbit of the system was examined. Using Dinescu et al. (1999) N-body code, the system's\napogalactic (Rmax ) and perigalactic (Rmin ) distances were obtained as 7.88\nand 8.81 kpc, respectively. Also, the maximum possible vertical separation\nfrom the galactic plane is |zmax |=50 pc for the system. When determining the\nellipticity the following formula was used:\n\ne=\n\nRmax \u2212 Rmin\n.\nRmax + Rmin\n\n(2)\n\nThe ellipticity was calculated as e = 0.06. This value shows that HD 194495\nis orbiting the Galaxy in an almost circular orbit and that the system belongs\nto the young thin-disc population.\n15\n\n\fAcknowledgment\n\nWe thank Prof. G.
