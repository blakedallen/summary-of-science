Introduction.\nApplication of Quantum Mechanics to real world many-body systems meets with several\ndifficulties, both of conceptual and pragmatic nature. A quantum mechanical system,\nwhich consists of at least two interacting subsystems exhibits a completely nonclassical\nproperty called \"entanglement\"[1]. It is a nonclassical correlation between systems\nwhich exists even between well separated subsystems [2, 3]. This unique property of\na quantum system is nowadays viewed as a powerful resource in quantum information\ntheory and quantum computation [4]. Also, on the conceptual side, \"entanglement\"\nwith an environment (degrees of freedom which inevitably interact with the quantum\nsystem of interest) is the key mechanism to explain why typically quantum effects are\nnot observed in macroscopic systems [5, 6]. Therefore the rate at which pure initial\nquantum states loose their potentiality to retain information represents at the same\ntime an old and a very modern problem.\nThe first theoretical implementation of the system plus environment dynamics,\nin both the weak and strong damping regimes, was proposed and carried out by\nCaldeira and Leggett [7]. They represent the environment as an infinity of oscillators,\nweakly coupled to the system of interest. Several successful descriptions of experiments,\nspecifically in quantum optics, were based on this type of model. More recently questions\nhave been raised about the role of classical chaos on the information loss process for\ncoupled quantum systems. In particular, the role of chaos in the decoherence process\n[8] has become a matter of active research and also a matter of debate [9, 10, 11].\nOne of the important issues now is: which type of environment is the more\neffective: the one involving an infinite number of degrees of freedom (quantum brownian\nmotion environment QBME), as proposed by Caldeira and Leggett, or an environment\nconsisting of a single degree of freedom which presents one or more characteristics of\nchaotic behavior?\nIn the standard model of decoherence, a joint system consisting of a system (S)\ncoupled to an environment (E) is described by a Hamiltonian\nHJ = HS + HE + V,\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere HS is the system's Hamiltonian, HE the environment's, and V the interaction\nHamiltonian between S and E. Let, for simplicity, the state space HS of the system be\ntwo-dimensional, and\nHS = \u03bb\u03c3z ,\n(1.2)\nwith \u03c3z the Pauli matrix with eigenvalues +1 and \u22121 corresponding to spin \"up\" and\n\"down\" along the z-axis, and respective eigenfunctions \u03c8+ and \u03c8\u2212 . In the coherent\nsuperposition\n\u03c8 = \u03b1+ \u03c8+ + \u03b1\u2212 \u03c8\u2212 ,\n(1.3)\nwith probability amplitudes \u03b1+ and \u03b1\u2212 such that |\u03b1+ |2 + |\u03b1\u2212 |2 = 1, \u03c3z has no definite\nvalue. The environment state (Hilbert) space is HE , and we suppose E is initially in the\n\n\fAnalytical relation between entropy production and quantum Lyapunov...\n\n3\n\nstate \u03c8E (0) \u2208 HE and the joint system in the pure (nonentangled) state\n\u03c8J (0) = \u03c8 \u2297 \u03c8E (0) \u2208 HS \u2297 HE .\n\n(1.4)\n\nWe also assume for simplicity that the interaction V in (1.1) is of the form\nV = \u03bc\u03c3z QE .\n\n(1.5)\n\nThen, after a time t, the joint system will be in the state (units are chosen such that\nh\u0304 = 1)\n\u03c8J (t) = (\u03b1+ exp[\u2212i\u03bbt]\u03c8+ \u2297 \u03c8E+ (t) + \u03b1\u2212 exp[i\u03bbt]\u03c8\u2212 \u2297 \u03c8E\u2212 (t)),\n(1.6a)\nwith\n\u03c8E\u00b1 (t) = exp[\u2212i(HE \u00b1 \u03bcQE )]\u03c8E (0).\n\n(1.6b)\n\nWe thus expect that the sensitivity to perturbation \u00b1\u03bcQE of a chaotic environment\nHamiltonian HE will, by (1.6a) and (1.6b), result in quick decoherence:\n|(\u03c8E+ (t), \u03c8E\u2212 (t))| \u2264 c exp[\u2212dt]\n\n(1.7)\n\nwhere d and c are positive constants. The exponential \"orbital\" instability of HE is\nexpected to lead via (1.6b) to the exponential decay of the \"overlaps\" (1.7) (think of\nGaussians centered at the corresponding orbits): the decoherence rate should therefore\nbe proportional to the rate at which the environment is able to explore its phase\nspace. These considerations are meant to explain, intuitively, why a (large) collection\nof harmonic oscillators - being stable systems - could, in principle, be less effective for\npurposes of decoherence than one sole unstable system.\nRecently, R. Blume-Kohout and W. H. Zurek [12] analyzed decoherence due to a toy\nmodel for the environment, an inverted harmonic oscillator environment (IHOE) \u2013 see\nalso [13, 14, 15] where conclusions similar to ours were obtained in chaotic systems. This\nis a nontrivial analytical tractable model whose importance as realized in [12] is that\nit shares one very important characteristic with chaotic systems, namely exponential\ninstability, defined by a positive upper Lyapunov exponent [16]. Systems of this sort\nare called Anosov systems. We shall be rather dealing with generalized Anosov systems,\nin the sense that the flows take place in a manifold which is not compact. A simple\n= \u03bbp and dq\n= \u2212\u03bbq.\nexample is the flow in the (p, q) plane defined (with \u03bb positive) by dp\ndt\ndt\nThe q coordinates of any two points moving with the flow get closer and closer as time\nproceeds, but the p coordinates separate exponentially fast, and hence the two points\nmove apart exponentially fast [17]. The directions of stable and unstable manifolds may\nvary from point to point, however, in contrast to the above example: this is the case of\nthe parametric oscillator. The quantum analogues of the classical Anosov systems have\nbeen dubbed quantum Anosov systems [18]: they exhibit a dynamic behavior which\nis at the same time rich and universal and they are characterized by having a positive\nupper quantum Lyapunov exponent, as defined in [19] and in the forthcoming (16), and\nwill be the subject of the present paper.\n\n\fAnalytical relation between entropy production and quantum Lyapunov...\n\n4\n\nGiven the importance of the subject, the difficulty in obtaining mathematically\nsound exact results which are eventually able to shed light onto these complex questions,\nwe feel that a thorough analytical investigation of the QBME vs. IHOE and its\ngeneralizations to more realistic models of the class of linearly coupled quantum Anosov\nsystems, can be extremely useful. We focus on the limited but important class of\ngaussian states. In this context, a rigorous demonstration of the growth of the system's\nreduced von Neumann entropy with the upper quantum Lyapunov exponent for the\naforementioned class of systems is given, showing thus that the rate of information\nloss is of more universal nature than that for the usual quantum brownian motion\nenvironment. Our analytical results are only possible due to the fact that for (possibly\nnonunitary) gaussian dynamics the rate of information loss is completely governed\nby a combination of quadratures, i.e. the covariance matrix, also called Schr\u00f6dinger\ngeneralized uncertainty principle.\n2. Relation between information loss and the covariance matrix for\ngaussian states.\nWe start by recalling a well known result [20, 21]. The most general 1-D gaussian state\ncan be written as\n\u03c1\u0302G = D(\u03b1)S(r, \u03c6)\u03c1\u0302\u03bd S \u2020 (r, \u03c6)D \u2020(\u03b1),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nD(\u03b1) = exp \u03b1\u00e2\u2020 \u2212 \u03b1\u2217 \u00e2 ,\n(2)\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0010\n\u0011\nr i\u03c6 \u20202\n(3)\ne \u00e2 \u2212 e\u2212i\u03c6 \u00e22\nS(r, \u03c6) = exp\n2\nare the displacement and the squeezing operator respectively and \u03c1\u0302\u03bd the thermal density\noperator with average number of excitations \u03bd,\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0012\n\u03bd\n1\n\u2020\n\u00e2 \u00e2 .\n(4)\nexp ln\n\u03c1\u0302\u03bd =\n1+\u03bd\n\u03bd +1\nNote that except in the improper limit of \u03bd \u2192 0, which corresponds to a squeezed\nstate, density matrix (1) is not a pure state.

We moreover have for the (von Neumann) entropy\nS[\u03c1\u0302] = \u2212 tr (\u03c1\u0302 ln \u03c1\u0302) = (\u03bd + 1) ln(\u03bd + 1) \u2212 \u03bd ln \u03bd.\n\n(6)\n\nComparing (6) with (5) we obtain the relation between the entropy and the Schro\u00f6dinger\ndeterminant\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1 \u221a\n1 \u221a\nS = ( D + 1) ln( D + 1) \u2212 ( D \u2212 1) ln( D \u2212 1)) \u2212 ln 2.\n(7)\n2\n2\n\n\fAnalytical relation between entropy production and quantum Lyapunov...\n\n5\n\nIt is worthwhile to point out that (7) holds for a wide range of (gaussian) states,\nranging from thermal (with S(r, \u03c6) = 1, D(\u03b1) = 1 in (1)) to generalized coherent states\n(the limit \u03bd \u2192 0 in (4), with S = 1 in (1)); (7) is thus a fundamental relation for\ngaussian states.\n3. Quantum Brownian Motion Environment (QBME).\nWe next consider an example of QBME widely used in the context of Quantum Optics,\nwhose dynamics (in the Born-Markov approximation) is governed by the Liouvillian\nh\n\ni\n\n\u0010\n\nL = \u2212 i\u03c9 \u00e2\u2020 \u00e2, \u2022 + k(n\u0304B + 1) 2\u00e2 \u2022 \u00e2\u2020 \u2212 \u00e2\u2020 \u00e2 \u2022 \u2212 \u2022 \u00e2\u2020 \u00e2\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n+ kn\u0304B 2\u00e2\u2020 \u2022 \u00e2 \u2212 \u00e2\u00e2\u2020 \u2022 \u2212 \u2022 \u00e2\u00e2\u2020 .\n\n\u0011\n\n(8)\n\nThe entropy is a function of \u03bd(t) only (see (6)), where\nq\n1\n(9)\n\u03bd(t) = (\u03c3a\u2020a (t))2 \u2212 \u03c3a\u2020a\u2020 (t)\u03c3aa (t) \u2212 ,\n2\nand\n1\n1\n\u03c3a\u2020a (t)\n= (\u03bd(0) + ) cosh(2r(0))e\u22122kt + (n\u0304B + )(1 \u2212 e\u22122kt ), (10)\n2\n2\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n(11)\n\u03c3a\u2020a\u2020 (t)\u03c3aa (t) = e\u22124kt (\u03bd(0) + )2 sinh2 (2r(0)) .\n2\nNotice that the entropy for this type of system may be obtained without resorting to\nthe calculation of the full density matrix, due to the fact that the information exchange\nbetween the system and bath is completely determined by a simple combination of\nquadratures. Also the entropy saturates for long enough times. Moreover, from equation\n(9) it is apparent that information loss depends both on the environment constants as\nwell as on the initial conditions.\n4. Inverted Harmonic Environment (IHE).\nWe now revisit the inverted harmonic oscillator example. Following (1.1), we have now\nHS = p21 /2 + \u03c912 x21 /2\nHE =\nV\n\np22 /2\n\n+\n\n= \u03bbx1 x2\n\n\u03c922 x22 /2\n\n(12)\n(13)\n(14)\n\nThe above Hamiltonian models two coupled harmonic oscillators: the first one, is a\nregular oscillator, with unit frequency, describing the system; the second one, an inverted\noscillator with squared frequency \u03c922 = \u2212\u039b2 , describing the environment. This is a\nnontrivial tractable model. Its importance, as has been realized in reference [12], relies\non its relation to chaos. Chaotic behavior requires besides stretching and folding in phase\nspace, instabilities characterized by positive Lyapunov exponents. Although the above\nhamiltonian is defined on the whole of phase space and does not exhibit chaotic behavior,\nit displays positive Lyapunov exponents like all Anosov systems. In this section we\n\n\fAnalytical relation between entropy production and quantum Lyapunov...\n\n6\n\nestablish a connection between Lyapunov exponents and the rate of information loss, in\nthis model, which we generalize to periodic quadratic Anosov systems in the next section\nand exemplify with a physically more sound system of coupled parametric oscillators.\nThe solution of the Heisenberg equations of motion for the vector \u1e91 = (x\u03021 , p\u03021 , x\u03022 , p\u03022 )T is\nas follows [22]\n\u1e91(t) = GeLt G(\u22121) \u1e91,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere G and L are constant matrices. The former is invertible and the latter is diagonal\nwith elements \u00b1\u03bb = \u00b1A(\u039b, \u03b1) and \u00b1\u03bc = \u00b1iB(\u039b, \u03b1), where A(\u039b, \u03b1) and B(\u039b, \u03b1) are\nreal and positive constants. The IHE Hamiltonian is a degenerate case of Floquet's\ntheorem, see the following. Notice the existence of an unstable mode, with positive\nclassical Lyapunov exponent \u03bb. In reference [19], upper quantum Lyapunov exponents\nwere defined, for systems of one degree of freedom with momentum p\u0302 and position x\u0302, as\nfollows\n1\n(16)\n\u03bb\u0304 = sup lim sup ln k[L\u03b1 , A(t, t0 )]k\nt\n\u03b1\u2208R2 t\u2192\u221e\nwere \u03b1 = (\u03b1p , \u03b1x ), and A(t, t0 ) is any bounded operator, i.e.with finite norm given by\nkAk = sup\u03c8 kA\u03c8k/k\u03c8k, where \u03c8 belongs to the Hilbert space L2 (R, dx), and evolved\nin the Heisenberg picture. This norm is nothing but the natural extension of the usual\nmatrix norm on the square integrable sequences to an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space.\nThe operator L\u03b1 = \u03b1p p\u0302 + \u03b1x x\u0302 is the generator of phase-space translations along a\ndirection \u03b1, and thus (16) has a close resemblance to the definition of the classical\nLyapunov exponents (see, e.g., [23]),but exploits the unitary nature of the quantum\ndynamics (see [19] for a discussion of these points).\nAlso in reference [19] the definition (16) was applied for one of the simplest\nparadigms of the transition from regular to unstable behavior in classical mechanics,\nnamely the parametrically driven oscillator, given by\n1\n1\n(17)\nH(t) = p\u03022 + f (t)x\u03022 ,\n2\n2\nwhere f (t) is a periodic function. The dynamical solution for x\u0302(t, 0) and p\u0302(t, 0) is a\nformally one dimensional version of (15), but with G being a periodic matrix with\nthe same period of the driving and L a traceless matrix: this is Floquet's theorem\nand the eigenvalues of L are known as Floquet exponents (see [19] for the proof and\nreferences). Applying definition (16) it was found that the upper quantum Lyapunov\nexponent is precisely the real part of the maximal Floquet exponent, which is positive\nin the classical instability region of the parametric oscillator, and zero in the stability\nregion. The generalization to two degrees of freedom is straightforward [24] and, applied\nto the IHE shows that the upper quantum Lyapunov exponent (16) is \u03bb (see equation\neingenvalues of the IHE). Let now Sr = \u2212 tr (\u03c11 ln \u03c11 ), the von Neumann entropy of the\nreduced density matrix, with \u03c11 \u2261 tr2 \u03c1, with \u03c1 of the form (1)-(4), but now with \u03bd \u2192 0,\ni.e., the initial state being a tensor product of generalized coherent states. Since \u03c11 is\n\n\fAnalytical relation between entropy production and quantum Lyapunov...\n\n7\n\nalso Gaussian, it continues to satisfy (7). In both cases, IHE and parametric oscillator\n(17), the determinant is found to be of the form\nD(t) =\n\n2\nX\n\nCab e(a\u03bb+b\u03bc)t ,\n\n(18)\n\na,b=\u22122\n\nwhere the constant coefficients Cab are given by cumbersome not particularly\nenlightening expressions. These coefficients, which are zero unless the sum of a and b is\nan even number, depend on the variances of the initial state and will be omitted here.\nFor instance, one can find Cab by looking at the asymptotic behavior of (6). For large\n2\u03bbt\nenough times\n\u221a t we have D(t) \u223c C20 e and the reduced entropy can be approximated\nby Sr \u223c ln( D \u2212 1/2) + 1 \u223c ln D/2. This behavior,\nSr (t) \u223c ln(C20 )/2 + \u03bbt\n\n(19)\n\nis precisely the one conjectured by Zurek several years ago [12]. Since \u03c11 is also gaussian,\n(7) applies to \u03c11 and thus the linear growth of Sr (t) is interpreted, in the present case\nof a bipartite system, as a coherence loss, which, as we see, depends only on the\nupper quantum Lyapunov exponent (uqLe) and is thus universal for this class of\nsystems, in contrast to QBME. Note that complexity in the present models (they are\nnot explicitly soluble classically and are a paradigm of the transition from regular to\nirregular behavior, see [25]) is brought about by the external field, which depends on\ntime in a nonlinear way! For the models with frequency varying almost periodically with\ntime - included in the present treatment - see [26]: it may be considered as a prototype\nof complexity. This is one of the reasons why our extension of [12] is significant: Zurek's\nIHOE is not complex!\nAs remarked in [12], section II, p. 032104-2, the IHE Hamiltonian is unphysical\nin that in general the directions of stable and unstable manifolds can vary from point\nto point. Thus it is of special interest to be able to consider as system 2 an arbitrary\nquantum Anosov system. In what follows we illustrate this by taking both systems of\nthe form (17), a case in which most computations can be done explicitly. This model\nis particularly rich: there is even a transition from a stability to an instability region,\nwhich has a physical interpretation in a model of quadrupole radio-frequency traps\n(Paul-Penning traps) (see [19] and references given there).\nFor the sake of comparison, in figure 1 we plot the entropy obtained for a quantum\nBrownian motion environment (BME) and for a IHO reservoir (parameters: (i) for the\nBME \u03bd0 = 1, r0 = 1, k = 0.5, nB = 10, \u03c9 = 1, \u03c6 = 0; (ii) for the IHO ln(C20 )/2 = 1.4\nand \u03bb = 1). Note that the increasing in the entropy in the case of BME saturates when\nthe system thermalizes with the reservoir, while the increase in the case of IHO is linear\n(in the asymptotic regime).\n\n\f8\n\nAnalytical relation between entropy production and quantum Lyapunov...\n\nSHtL\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nt\n\nFigure 1.

Coupled parametric oscillators.\nConsider now a more realistic example, physically relevant in connection with Paul traps\n[27], which models two coupled parametric oscillators with hamiltonian\nH(t) = HS (t) + HE (t) + V\n\n(20)\n\nwhere\n\nand\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\nHS (t) = p\u030221 + \u03c912 \u2212 q cos 2t x\u030221 ,\n2\n\u0011\n1 2 \u0010 2\nHE (t) = p\u03022 + \u03c92 \u2212 q cos 2t x\u030222\n2\n\n(21)\n(22)\n\ng\n(23)\nV = (x\u03021 \u2212 x\u03022 )2 .\n2\nIn what follows we assume g > 0 and \u03c922 > \u03c912. We remark that (20) corresponds\nto the standard model (1.1). The solution of the Heisenberg equations of motion for\nthe position and momentum operators can be written in terms of Mathieu functions.\nFor example, the momentum of the second oscillator, p\u03022 (t) is given by the expression\nu1 (t)x\u03021 (0) + u2 (t)p\u03021 (0) + u3 (t)x\u03022 (0) + u4 (t)p\u03022 (0), where the functions ua (t), a = 1, 2, 3, 4\nare given, respectively, by\n\"\n\n\u1e60(\u03b1+ , q, 0)\n\u1e60(\u03b1\u2212 , q, 0)\nC(\u03b1\u2212 , q, t) \u2212\nC(\u03b1+ , q, t)\nu1 = sin(2\u03b8)\n2D2\n2D1\n\n#\n\n\u1e60(\u03b1\u2212 , q, 0)\n\u1e60(\u03b1+ , q, 0)\nC(\u03b1\u2212 , q, t) \u2212 sin2 \u03b8\nC(\u03b1+ , q, t)\nD2\nD1\n#\n\"\nC(\u03b1+ , q, 0)\nC(\u03b1\u2212 , q, 0)\nS(\u03b1\u2212 , q, t) \u2212\nS(\u03b1+ , q, t)\nu3 = sin(2\u03b8)\n2D2\n2D1\nC(\u03b1\u2212 , q, 0)\nC(\u03b1+ , q, 0)\nu4 = cos2 \u03b8\nS(\u03b1\u2212 , q, t) \u2212 sin2 \u03b8\nS(\u03b1+ , q, t).\nD2\nD1\nu2 = cos2 \u03b8\n\n(24)\n(25)\n(26)\n(27)\n\n\fAnalytical relation between entropy production and quantum Lyapunov...\nq\n\n\u03c9 2 +\u03c9 2\n\n9\n\n(\u03c9 2 \u2212\u03c9 2 )2\n\nThe parameters \u03b1\u00b1 = 1 2 2 + g \u00b1 g 2 + 2 4 1 depend on the constants appearing in\nthe Hamiltonian. The angle \u03b8 appearing in the expressions above is determined from\nthe equality: tan(2\u03b8) = \u03c922g\n. The functions C(\u03b1, q, t) and S(\u03b1, q, t) are the usual\n\u2212\u03c9 2\n2\n\n1\n\nMathieu cosine and sine functions, and\n\u010a(\u03b1, q, t) and \u1e60(\u03b1, q, t) their\n\u0010\n\u0011 time derivatives.\n1\ni\u03c6t\n\u2212i\u03c6t\nP (\u03b1, q, \u2212t) , where P (\u03b1, q, t)\nFrom the expression C(\u03b1, q, t) = 2 e P (\u03b1, q, t) + e\nis a periodic function with period \u03c0 and \u03c6 = \u03c6(\u03b1, q) is the so-called characteristic\nexponent, it can be seen that, if I(\u03c6) 6= 0 the solutions exhibit an unstable behavior.\nOtherwise the solutions are uniformly bounded. We are interested here in a situation\nin which the second uncoupled forced oscillator (system) is in the stability region and\nthe other (environment) is in the unstable region. From the solutions of the Heisenberg\nequations of motion and the definition of the upper quantum Lyapunov exponent \u03bb\u0304, it is\na simple matter to show that \u03bb\u0304 = |I(\u03c6(\u03b11 , q))|. The connection with the information loss\nis made through the evaluation of Schro\u00f6dinger determinant for the second oscillator,\nwhich turns out to be of the form of equation (18). In this case, however, the coefficients\nCab are periodic functions of time. Moreover \u03bb\u0304 = |I(\u03c6(\u03b11 , q))| and \u03bc = i\u03c6(\u03b12 , q). For\nan initial gaussian state, S(tn ) \u223c ln(C20 )/2 + \u03bbtn , where tn = 2\u03c0n. The coefficients Cab\nare obtained from the asymptotic behavior of the entropy (6).\n6. Conclusions.\nIn spite of exhibiting a complex, rich dynamical behavior, bipartite open quantum\nAnosov systems display, in their instability region of parameters, a reduced von\nNeumann entropy with linear growth determined by their uqLe, a universal behavior\nfor this class of systems, in contrast to QBME. This also permitted us to find a unified\ndescription of two opposite regimes, viz. of small and large coupling. It may, however,\nbe argued that (18) is induced by classical mechanics: the value of the uqLe for the\npresent models equals the classical maximal Floquet exponent, which is positive in\nR\nthe region where the classical parameter E = T1 0T f (t) dt lies in the instability region\n2\n(\"gap\") of Hill's equation ddt2x + f (t)x = 0 [28], as may abstracted from the last section.\nThis is a consequence of the fact that the dynamics of the observables is classical. The\nspace of states is, nevertheless, subject to the laws of quantum mechanics, without\nclassical analogue, even in these cases: for this reason, for gaussian initial states,\nthe entropy growth (19) is to be interpreted, due to (7), as coherence loss, a purely\nquantum mechanical concept. Indeed, in contrast to quantum mechanical entropy, the\nclassical entropy is not an adequate quantity in information theory, because it is not even\npositive in general: ([29], Prop.1). Negative entropies are due to the fact that classical\ndensity distributions may be concentrated in regions of phase space < h,contradicting\nthe uncertainty principle ([30], [31]). Modified \"semiclassical entropies\" without this\ninconvenience have been defined by Wehrl [31], but they incorporate the Hilbert space\nstructure of quantum physics, i.e, of a countable discrete basis of states. Entanglement\nhas indeed been described in terms of this modified entropy [32]. Thus an explanation\nby \"classical entanglement\" of phenomena of information loss is not possible in a full\n\n\fAnalytical relation between entropy production and quantum Lyapunov...\n\n10\n\nclassical treatment involving the entropy.\nA still different approach is to regard entanglement in terms of the Wigner function,\ni.e., in phase space, which illuminates quite different and surprising aspects [33].\nWe should caution the reader that, even in the framework of (time-dependent)\nquadratic Hamiltonians, our approach misses an important element which is present in\nfully chaotic systems: folding, which is characteristic of a compact phase space. Indeed,\nother papers have reported on the growth of relative entropy in the context of quantized\nchaotic systems ([34],[35]). In contrast to the present treatment they rely, however,\non approximations (based on random matrix theory in [34], semiclassical analysis in\n[35]), numerical studies and certain special constructions (the nonunitary step in [35]\nis constructed to mimic the presence of diffusion) and special concepts (a particularly\nphase-space measure of complexity was used in [34]). We hope that the discrete WeylWigner formalism developed in [36] may be used to extend our treatment to some\nquantum chaotic systems.\nAs a final remark, we mention that other parameters could be invoked for\nenvironments characterized by generic chaotic systems: the diffusion coefficient is one of\nthem, which is conjectured to be related to the Lyapunov exponent and the Hausdorff\ndimension [37].\nAcknowledgments\nParreira, Souza Nemes and Wreszinski thank CNPq-Brasil for financial support.
