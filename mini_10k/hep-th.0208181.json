Wilson [1]. This fixed point is located on a hypersurface of\nsecond order phase transition which separates the symmetric phase from the broken symmetry phase. In the\nfollowing we call this fixed point the Heisenberg fixed\npoint (HFP for short) as in Ref. [10]. It should not be\nconfused with the fixed point relevant for the BMB mechanism and which is not studied in detail here. The main\nresult of the article is that the bare potential corresponding to the HFP has singularities in the complex plane and\nthat ignoring these singularities may lead to inaccurate\napproximations. These claims are based on explicit calculations performed in the large-N limit for two O(N )\ninvariant models reviewed in section II. These two models are: 1) a model with a k 2 kinetic term together with\na sharp cut-off, the sharp cut-off model (SCM) for short;\n2) Dyson's hierarchical model (HM) [12,13].\nBefore entering into technical details, three points\nshould be clear. First, all the results presented here are\nbased on the analysis of long numerical series and no attempt is made to give rigorous proofs. Second, in order\nto understand some of the statements made below, the\nreader should be aware that even though, at leading order\nin the large-N approximation, the critical exponents take\nN -independent values, the same approximation provides\nfinite N approximate HFP which are N -dependent. A\nmore precise formulation of this statement can be found\nin Sections II and VI. Third, we only work in 3 dimensions. The precise meaning of this statement for the hierarchical model is explained at the end of section II.\nIn section III, we review the basic equations [2,10]\ndefining the HFP for the SCM. We then show that the\ndefinition can be extended naturally for the HM. The correctness of this definition is verified later in the paper. In\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nSince the early days of the renormalization group (RG)\nmethod [1], 3-dimensional scalar models have been identified as an important laboratory to discuss the existence\nof non-trivial fixed points and the large cut-off (or small\nlattice spacing) limit of field theory models. In the case\nof N -components models with an O(N ) invariant Lagrangian, the RG transformation becomes particularly\nsimple in the large-N limit [2]. The construction of the\neffective potential for these models is discussed in Refs.\n[3\u20135]. Later, motivated by perturbative results indicating\nthe existence of an UV stable tricritical fixed point for\nN large enough [6], a new mechanism allowing spontaneous breakdown of scale invariance and dynamical mass\ngeneration was found in the large-N limit [7]. In the following, we call this mechanism the \"BMB mechanism\".\nIt was argued [8] that the BMB mechanism is compatible\nwith a zero vacuum energy and a better understanding\nof this question might suggest a solution to the cosmological constant problem. Spontaneous breaking of scale\ninvariance is also discussed [9] with related methods in\nfour-dimensional models of clear interest in the context\nof particle physics. However, doubts were cast [10] about\nthe fact that the BMB mechanism is generic and it is\ncommonly believed that it disappears at finite N .\nIn this article we report results which force us to reconsider the way we think about non-trivial fixed points.\nWe usually think of the RG flows as taking place in a\nspace of bare couplings or more generally in a space of\nfunctions. The necessity for this more general point of\nview appears quite clearly in exact renormalization group\nequations [11]. Unfortunately, it seems impossible to decide a-priori which space of functions should be considered to study the RG flows. It is clear from perturbation\ntheory that near the Gaussian fixed point, low dimensional polynomial approximations of the local potential\nshould be adequate. However, it is not clear that this\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\ne-mail:yannick-meurice@uiowa.edu\npermanent address\n\n1\n\n\fsection IV, we present the methods used to calculate the\ncritical potential expanded as a Taylor series in \u03c62 . The\ncoefficients of this expansion are called the critical couplings. The main conclusion that we can infer from our\nnumerical results is that the Taylor series is inadequate\nfor large values of \u03c62 . First of all, one half of the critical\ncouplings are negative. If we truncate the Taylor series\nat an order such that the coefficient of the highest order\nis negative, we obtain an ill-defined functional integral.\nIn addition, the absolute value of the critical couplings\ngrows exponentially with the order and the expansion\nhas a finite radius of convergence. Consequently, the idea\nthat the critical potential associated with the HFP can\nbe approximated by polynomials should be reconsidered.\nIt is nevertheless possible to define the critical theory\nby using Pad\u00e9 approximants for the critical potential. In\nsection V, we show that sequences of approximants converge toward the expected function in a way very reminiscent of the case of the anharmonic oscillator were the\nconvergence can be proven rigorously [14]. In addition,\nthe zeroes and the poles of these approximants are located far away from the real positive axis and follow patterns that strongly suggest the existence of two complex\nconjugated branch points.\nThe complex singularities of the critical potential\nshould not be interpreted as a failure of the RG approach\nbut rather as an artifact of the system of coordinates\nused. In section VI, we present consistent arguments\nshowing that in a different system of coordinates [15,16],\nthe function associated with the HFP is free of singularities. In this system of coordinates, finite dimensional\ntruncation is a meaningful procedure which, in the case of\nthe HM, allows comparison with independent numerical\ncalculations at finite N . An example of such a calculation\nis presented in the case N = 5.\nIn section VII, we discuss the errors associated with\ntwo approximate procedures that can be used to deal\nwith the singularities. The first procedure which is justified in the context of perturbation theory and does not\nrequire an understanding of the singularities, consists in\ntruncating the potential at order (\u03c62 )3 . The second procedure consists in restricting the range of integration of\n\u03c62 to the radius of convergence of the critical potential.\nIf the range of integration is large enough, this second\nprocedure generates small errors [17]. As far as the calculation of the HFP in the system of coordinates of Section\nVI is concerned, both procedures have a low accuracy for\nboth models considered. In the conclusions, we explain\nwhy we believe that the singularities persist at finite N\nand we discuss implications of the existence of these singularities for other problems.\n\n~ =\nZ(J)\n\nYZ\n\ndN \u03c6x e\u2212S+\n\nx\n\nP\n\nx\n\n~x\nJ~x \u03c6\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwith\nS=\u2212\n\nX\n1X~\n~y +\n\u03c6x \u2206xy \u03c6\nVo (\u03c62x ) .\n2 xy\nx\n\n(2)\n\n~ x .\u03c6\n~x and \u2206xy is a symmetric\nWe use the notation \u03c62x \u2261 \u03c6\nmatrix with negative eigenvalues, such as discrete versions of the Laplacian. For the\nP simplicity of the presentation, we will assume that x \u2206xy = 0. If it is not the\ncase, one can always subtract the zero mode from \u2206 and\ncompensate it with a new term in V .\nDefining the rescaled potential\nV0 (X) = N U0 (\n\nX\n),\nN\n\n(3)\n\nand performing a Legendre transform from the source J~\n~c , one can show that in\nto the external classical field \u03c6\nthe large N limit [10] that M 2 \u2261 2\u2202Vef f /\u2202\u03c62c obeys the\nself-consistent equation\n2U0\u2032 (\u03c62c + f\u2206 (M 2 )) = M 2 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere f\u2206 (M 2 ) is the one-loop integral corresponding to\nthe quadratic form \u2206 and a mass term M 2 . The prime\ndenotes the derivative with respect to the O(N ) invariant argument. The explicit form of f for the two models\ndiscussed in the following are given in Eqs. (6-7). Precise definitions of \u03c62c and the effective potential Vef f are\ngiven in [10].\nUp to now, all the quantities introduced are dimensionless. They can be interpreted as dimensionful quantities\nexpressed in cut-off units. Let us consider two models,\nthe first one with a rescaled potential U0 , a UV cutoff\n\u039b and a quadratic form \u2206 and a second model with a\nrescaled potential U0,S , a UV cutoff \u039b/S and a quadratic\nform \u2206S . For D = 3 and in the large-N limit, the\ntwo models have the same dimensionful zero-momentum\nGreen's functions provided that:\nU \u20320,S (\u03c62 ) =\n(5)\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0001\n\u0001\n2 \u2032\n2\n\u2032\n2\n\u2032\n2\n2\nS U0 \u03c6 \u2212 f\u2206S (2U0,S (\u03c6 ) /S + f\u2206 (2/S )U0,S (\u03c6 )\nIn two special cases, the dimensionless expression for the\none-loop diagram is independent of the cut-off. In other\nwords, f\u2206 = f\u2206S \u2261 f and the fixed point equation becomes very simple [2,10].\nWe now discuss the two models where this simplification occurs. In the SCM, \u2206 becomes k 2 in the momentum\nrepresentation (Fourier modes). The momentum cutoff is\nsharp: k 2 \u2264 1 (in cut-off units). This is why we call this\nmodel the sharp cutoff model. The non-renormalization\nof the kinetic term is justified in the large-N limit [10].\nFor this model,\n\nII.

On the other hand, for\nnegative K, one obtains a line of fixed points ending (for\nK = 0) at the fixed point relevant for the BMB mecha1\nnism. Given the isolation of the fixed point with K = 4\u03c0\n,\nit is easy to identify it with the HFP. We denote the cor\u22c6\nresponding inverse function by FSCM\n(z) = fSCM,reg. (z).\nAs promised this function is analytical in a neighborhood\nof the origin and has a Taylor expansion:\n\nIn this section, we review the construction of the HFP\nfor the SCM, and we show that the construction can be\nextended in a natural (but non-trivial) way for the HM.\nThe first step consists in finding all the fixed points of\nthe RG Eq. (5). Following Refs. [2,10], we introduce the\ninverse function:\n(8)\n\nand the function H(z) \u2261 F (z) \u2212 f (z) , where the oneloop function f has been defined in the previous section\nfor the two models considered.

However,\nas we will see in section IV, this expansion allows us to\nconstruct an inverse power series and U0 .\nIn the case of the HM, the decomposition into a regular and singular part is more tedious. Fortunately, this\nproblem is a particular case of a problem solved in section 5 of Ref. [19] where Eq. (5.6) with A = c2 , B = c\u22121\nand f (z) = G(z/b) yields\n\n(9)\n\nFor the SCM, S is allowed to vary continuously in Eq.\n(9) and the general solution is\nF (z) = fSCM (z) + Kz 1/2 .\n\n1\n(1 + z 1/2 Arctan(z 1/2 )) ,\n2\u03c0 2\n\nand\n\nIII. THE HFP\n\nH(z) = SH(z/S 2) .\n\n(12)\n\nand q runs over positive and negative integers. The only\nrestriction on the constants K and Kq is that F should\nhave a well defined inverse which is real when F (= \u03c62 )\nis real and positive.\nIt is clear from Eqs. (6) and (7) that for both models f (z) has singularities along the negative real axis and\nthat, in general, F (z) cannot be defined for z real and\nnegative. This imposes restrictions on the choice of the\nconstants K and Kq . For instance, in the case of the\nSCM, when K takes a large positive value, it is impossible to reach small values of F = \u03c62 when z \u2265 0 and\nthe fixed point has no obvious physical interpretation.\nHowever, there is a special positive value of K for which\nthe singularity of fSCM is exactly canceled and an analytic continuation for z < 0 is possible. Its exact value\ncan be calculated [10] by decomposing fSCM into a regular part fSCM,reg. and a singular part fSCM,sing. . Using\nelementary trigonometric identities, one finds\n\n\u03b2c\n. The inverse temperature \u03b2\nwith c = 21\u22122/D and b= 2\u2212c\nand the parameter c appear in the hamiltonian of the HM\nin a way that is explained in section II of Ref. [18]. The\nparameter c is related to the dimension D by considering\nthe scaling of a massless Gaussian field. In the following\nwe will consider the case c = 21/3 (D = 3) exclusively. In\naddition, \u03b2 will be set to 1 as in other fixed point calculations [18]. Different values of \u03b2 can be introduced by\na trivial rescaling. Note also that the cutoff cannot be\nchanged continuously for the HM, because the invariance\nof f is only valid when we integrate the degrees of freedom of a the largest momentum shell (corresponding to\nthe hierarchically nested blocks in configuration space)\nall at the same time. For the HM, the density of sites is\nreduced by a factor 2 at each RG transformation. The\nlinear dimension (\"lattice spacing\") is thus increased by\nby a factor 21/D and the cutoff decreased by the same\nfactor. Consequently, for the HM, Eq. (5) should be\nunderstood only with S = 2q/D = 2q/3 and q integer.\n\nF (2U0\u2032 (\u03c62 )) = \u03c62 ,\n\n3\u03c0\n\u2243 13.6 ,\nln2\n\n(10)\n\nFor the HM, S can only be an integer power of 21/3 and\nthe general solution has an infinite number of free parameters:\nX\nF (z) = fHM (z) +\nKq z 1/2+iq\u03c9 ,\n(11)\n\n\u00011/2+iq\u03c9\nz/b\n\u03c9 X\nfHM,sing.

There exists a unique choice\nof the Kq in Eq. (11) which cancels exactly the singular part of fHM . We call the corresponding fixed point\nthe HFP of the HM. The numerical closeness with the\nfinite N HFP discussed in section VI confirms the validity of this analogic definition. We call the corresponding\n\u22c6\ninverse function FHM\n. Using Eq.

We then reexpand the series\nabout that value of z (which corresponds to F = \u03c62 = 0)\nand invert it. The resulting series is an expansion of 2U0\u22c6 '\nin \u03c62 . After integration, and up to an arbitrary constant\nu0 , we obtain a Taylor series for the critical potential U0\u22c6\ncorresponding to the HFP.

The terms with larger |q| have\na much smaller amplitude. These findings are consistent with the log-periodic oscillations found numerically\nin HT expansions [20,19]. The oscillatory terms are very\nsmall along the positive real axis. However, in the complex plane, if we write z = rei\u03b8 , the amplitude is multiplied by e\u2212q\u03c9\u03b8 which compensates the suppression of the\ndenominators in Eq.

CALCULATION OF THE CRITICAL\nPOTENTIAL U0\u22c6\n\nIn the previous section, we have provided power series\nfor the inverse function F (z) corresponding to the HFP\nof the SCM and the HM. We can use these series to define F (z) on the negative real axis. In both cases, as we\nmove toward more negative values of z, F becomes zero\nwithin the radius of convergence of the expansion.

Natural Logarithm of the absolute value of the coefficients un of the critical potential U0\u22c6 defined in Eq. (20)\nfor the SCM (filled squares) and the HM (empty circles).\n\n4\n\n\f(21) corresponds to a pair (\u03c62 , U0\u22c6 (\u03c62 )) with the arbitrary constant in U0\u22c6 fixed in such a way that U0\u22c6 vanishes at its minimum. We have calculated F \u22c6 by using the independent but approximate Eq. (19). As explained in section III, the approximate expression is only\nvalid for z real and positive and should give 18 correct\nsignificant digits. In Fig. 3, we have used the values\nz = 2U0\u2032 = 0, 0.25, 0.5, . . .. This is why the filled squares\nonly appear when the derivative of U0\u22c6 is positive. Unlike\nEq. (17) which has a radius of convergence 1, the approximate expression Eq. (19) remains valid for large positive\nvalues of z. It is thus possible to check if Pad\u00e9 approximants can be used to represent the critical potential beyond the radius of convergence of its Taylor expansion.\nFig. 3 shows that low order approximants are close to\nthe parametric curve. As the order increases, the curves\ncoalesce with the parametric curve and a more refined\ndescription is necessary.\nIn Fig. 4, we give the accuracy reached by various approximants for the HM with a broad range of \u03c62 (more\nthan 4 times the radius of convergence). As the order of\nthe approximants increase the accuracy increases but at\na rate which is slower for larger values of \u03c62 . The figure is\nvery similar to sequences of Pad\u00e9 approximants obtained\nfor the ground state of the anharmonic oscillator (see Fig.\n1 of Ref. [17]), where the convergence can be proven rigorously [14]. Note that the slow convergence at large \u03c62\nis not a serious problem, since the contributions for large\n\u03c62 are exponentially suppressed in the functional integral. The choice of [L + 3/L] approximants is discussed\nin more detail below. Up to now, we only discussed the\nHM. Following the same procedure for the SCM, we obtain very similar figures (with a different \u03c62 scale) which\nwe have not displayed.\n\nThe absolute values of the first 50 coefficients of both\nmodels are shown in Fig. 2. In both cases, it appears\nclearly that the absolute value grows at an exponential\nrate. Linear fits of the right part of Fig. 2 suggest a\nradius of convergence of order 0.11 for the SCM and 2.5\nfor the HM. The signs of both series follow the periodic\npattern: + - - + + - + + - - for the SCM and + + - - for\nthe HM. This suggests singularities in the complex plane\nat an angle k\u03c0\n5 with respect to the positive real axis (k =\n1, 3, 7, 9) for the SCM and along the imaginary axis for\nthe HM. This analysis is confirmed by an analysis of the\npoles of Pad\u00e9 approximants presented in the next section.\n\nV. PAD\u00c9 APPROXIMANTS OF U0\u22c6\n\nAt this point, our series expansion of the critical potential does not allows us to define the critical theory as a\nfunctional integral. As \u03c62 exceeds the critical values estimated in the previous section, the power series is unable\nto reproduce the expected function U0\u22c6 .

The system of\ncoordinates for this space can be chosen in a way which\nis convenient to make approximations.

As the order\nincreases, the accuracy degrades slowly. This is explained\nin more detail below. However, the ratios of successive\ncoefficients still follows closely the asymptotic prediction\nobtained from Eq. (27).

(25).\nIn this section and the next section, we discuss the details of the calculations for the HM. The case of the SCM\nshares many similarities with the HM and is discussed\nbriefly at the end of each section.\nWe have performed a numerical calculation of the an\nof the HM using Eq. (24) in the particular case N = 5.\nThe study of the ratios of successive coefficients displayed\nin Fig. 8 indicates that the |an | decay faster than 1/n!\nand that R\u22c6 (~k) is analytical over the entire complex k 2\nplane in contrast to U0\u22c6 (\u03c62 ) which has a finite radius of\nconvergence in the complex \u03c62 plane.\nThe good convergence of R\u22c6 (~k) can be explained by\nan approximate calculation. The \u03c6 integral that is performed in the calculation of the an has a positive integrand with a peak moving to larger values of |\u03c6| when\nn increases.

In brief, it consists of finding the\nstable manifold by fine tuning the temperature and then\niterating the RG transformation in order to get rid of\nthe irrelevant directions.

Remarkably, we found that even\n\nIn section V, we have shown that the Pad\u00e9 approximants provide accurate values of U0\u22c6 far beyond its radius\nof convergence. In order to estimate the error on the new\ncoordinates an due to the use of approximants for U0\u22c6 , we\ncan vary the range of integration and change the approximants. For instance the values of an of the HM used in\nFig. 8 have been calculated using a range of integration\n|\u03c6| < 20 and a [26/23] Pad\u00e9 approximant.

Restricting the range of integration to\nsmaller values produces sizable effects. As an example,\nthe small effects due a restriction to |\u03c6| < 4.4 are shown\nin Fig. 9. Similarly, the values of an are not very sensitive to small changes in the Pad\u00e9 approximants.

Results\nvery similar to those shown in Fig. 9 for the HM can be\nproduced. Since it contains essentially the same information, it has not been displayed. It should however be\nnoted that the number of significant digits obtained with\nthe two alternate procedures are lower than in the case\nof the HM.

CONCLUSIONS\n\n0\nnum.\n0\n\n5\n\nWe have shown in two differents models where the critical potential can be calculated at leading order in the\n1/N expansion that these potentials have finite radii of\nconvergence due to singularities in the complex plane.\nDo such a results persist at finite N ? In the case of the\nHM, the behavior of the ratios at finite N shown in Fig.\n8 strongly suggests that at large real positive \u03c62 , the\ncritical potential still grows like (\u03c62 )3 . Can an infinite\nsum converging over the entire complex plane have this\nkind of behavior? This is certainly not impossible (e.g.,\n2\n(\u03c62 )3 + e\u2212\u03c6 ), however it requires cancellations that we\njudge unlikely to happen. Consequently, we conjecture\nthat the singularities observed are generic rather than\nbeing an artifact of the large-N limit.\nWe have observed that in a system of coordinates\nwhere the HFP can be approximated by polynomials,\nthe procedure which consists in considering bare potential truncated at order (\u03c62 )3 describes the HFP with a\nlow accuracy. We are planning to investigate if similar\nproblems appear near tricritical fixed points. In particular, reconsidering the RG flows in a larger space of bare\nparameters may affect the generic dimension of the intersections of hypersurface of various codimensions and\nhelp us finding a more general realization of spontaneous\nbreaking of scale invariance with a dynamical generation\nof mass.\nOur results have qualitative similarities common with\nthose of Refs. [22]: we found some \"pathologies\" which\nforce us to look at the RG transformations in a more\nopen-minded way. We are planning [23] to compare in\nmore detail, the leading order results presented here with\nfinite N results, as suggested in Ref. [24] for the local potential approximation. Another issue regarding the O(N )\nmodels and which would deserve a more detailed investigation is the question of first order phase transitions\n[25,26].\n\n6\n\nup to \u03c6\n\n10\n15\norder n\n\n20\n\nFIG. 9.

The alternate procedure\nare the truncation at order (\u03c62 )3 (filled circles), the N = 5\naccurate numerical result (filled square), no Pad\u00e9 approximants but a truncation of the range of integration close to\nthe radius of convergence (empty circles), a restriction of the\nrange of integration for \u03c6 < 4.4 (stars), and a [14/11] Pad\u00e9\n(diamonds).\n\nHaving demonstrated that we can calculate the first\n20 coefficients an , at leading order in the 1/N expansion,\nwith at least 10 significant digits, we can now discuss the\nerrors associated with other procedures mentioned in the\nintroduction. The first procedure consists in truncating\nU0\u22c6 keeping only the terms up to order (\u03c62 )3 . This is procedure inspired by perturbation theory amounts to keep\nonly the relevant and marginal directions near the Gaussian fixed point. From Fig. 9, we see that this procedure\ngenerates errors which are of the same order as the errors\ndue to the use of the leading 1/N approximation. Consequently, this procedure is quite unsuitable to study the\ncorrection to this approximation. Slightly better results\nare obtained by keeping as many terms as possible in the\nexpansion (up to 50 in our calculation) but restricting the\nrange of integration in such way that we stay within the\nradius of convergence. Given the rescaling of Eq. (3) this\nmeans that\n\u221a for N = 5, we need to restrict the integration\nto |\u03c6| < 5 \u00d7 2.5 \u2243 3.54 which is substantially smaller\nthan the acceptable field cutoff 4.9 mentioned above. As\none can see from Fig. 9, this creates errors which are be8\n\n\f[11] There is a large literature on this question.
