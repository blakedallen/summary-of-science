KNUDSON\nAbstract. We study the Gassner representation of the pure braid group Pn\nby considering its restriction to a free subgroup F . The kernel of the restriction\nis shown to lie in the subgroup [\u03933 F, \u03932 F ], sharpening a result of Lipschutz.\n\n1. Introduction\n\u00b11\nDenote by Gn : Pn \u2192 GLn (Z[t\u00b11\n1 , . . . , tn ]) the unreduced Gassner representation of the pure braid group Pn (a formula is given in Section 2 below). The\nfaithfulness of Gn for n \u2265 4 is a long-standing open question. In this note, we investigate this by considering the restriction of Gn to a certain free subgroup Fn\u22121\nof Pn :\ngn : Fn\u22121 \u2212\u2192 GLn (Z[t1\u00b11 , . . . , t\u00b11\nn ]).\n\nThe faithfulness of Gn would follow from that of gn (see Proposition 2.1 below, or\n[3] for a more general result).\nFor a group H, denote by \u0393\u2022 H the lower central series of H. The main result of\nthis paper is the following.\nTheorem 3.4. The kernel of gn lies in the subgroup [\u03933 Fn\u22121 , \u03932 Fn\u22121 ].\nThis is proved by passing to the graded quotients associated to the lower central\n\u00b11\nseries of Fn\u22121 and the filtration of GLn (Z[t\u00b11\n1 , . . . , tn ]) by powers of the augment 7\u21921\n\ni\n\u00b11\ntation ideal J = ker{Z[t\u00b11\n1 , . . . , tn ] \u2212\u2192 Z}. This allows us to show that the\n5\nkernel of gn lies in \u0393 Fn\u22121 . In [8], S. Lipschutz proved that the kernel of gn lies in\n[\u03932 Fn\u22121 , \u03932 Fn\u22121 ] using different techniques (see also [1] for another proof). These\ntwo facts together allow us to prove Theorem 3.4.\nWe also show (Theorem 3.5) that the intersection of the kernel of gn with \u0393s Fn\u22121\nlies in the subgroup [\u0393s\u22122 Fn\u22121 , \u03932 Fn\u22121 ] * \u0393s+1 Fn\u22121 .\n\nAcknowledgements. I thank Fred Cohen for suggesting this question to me and for\nmany useful conversations. I am also grateful to an anonymous referee for many\nhelpful comments.\n2. Preliminaries and Notation\n2.1. The Gassner representation. Denote by Ars , 1 \u2264 r < s \u2264 n, the generators\nof Pn . The (unreduced) Gassner representation is the homomorphism Gn : Pn \u2192\n\u00b11\nGLn (Z[t\u00b11\n1 , . . . , tn ]) given by the formula:\nDate: November 1, 2004.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 20F36.\nPartially supported by NSF grant no.

This representation is reducible to an\n(n \u2212 1)-dimensional representation, but the resulting formula is more complicated.\n\n2.2. The free subgroup. Denote by Fn\u22121 the free subgroup of Pn obtained by\ndeleting the last string; this subgroup has generators A1n , A2n , . . . , An\u22121,n . Moreover, we have a split short exact sequence\n1 \u2212\u2192 Fn\u22121 \u2212\u2192 Pn \u2212\u2192 Pn\u22121 \u2212\u2192 1\nso that Pn is the semidirect product of Pn\u22121 and Fn\u22121 . Also, the following diagram\ncommutes ([2], p. 138):\nPn\nGn\n\n\u000f\nGn (Pn )\n\n/ Pn\u22121\nGn\u22121\n\n\u000f\n/ Gn\u22121 (Pn\u22121 )\n\nwhere the lower horizontal map is given by setting tn = 1 and deleting the nth row\nand column.\nDenote by \u0393\u2022 Fn\u22121 the lower central series of Fn\u22121 and for each i, consider the\nfree abelian group\n\u0393i Fn\u22121 /\u0393i+1 Fn\u22121 .\nWe shall need an explicit basis of each \u0393i Fn\u22121 /\u0393i+1 Fn\u22121 ; this is given by the set\nof basic commutators of weight i. These are defined as follows. Denote by xj the\nimage of Ajn in Fn\u22121 /\u03932 Fn\u22121 . Then the xj are the basic commutators of weight\none (denote this by w(xj ) = 1) and having defined the basic commutators of weight\nless than i, the basic commutators of weight i are the various [cu , cv ] where\n(1) cu and cv are basic with w(cu ) + w(cv ) = i, and\n(2) cu > cv and if cu = [ca , cb ], then cv \u2265 cb .\nThe commutators are ordered as follows. Those of weight i follow those of weight\nless than i and are ordered arbitrarily with respect to each other. A proof that the\nbasic commutators of weight i form a basis of \u0393i Fn\u22121 /\u0393i+1 Fn\u22121 may be found in\n[4], p. 175.\nDenote by gn the restriction of Gn to Fn\u22121 and set Xn = gn (Fn\u22121 ).\nProposition 2.1.\nGn is faithful\n\n\u21d4 gn is faithful\n\u21d4 the map \u0393i Fn\u22121 /\u0393i+1 Fn\u22121 \u2192 \u0393i Xn /\u0393i+1 Xn\nis injective for each i \u2265 1.\n\n\fON THE KERNEL OF THE GASSNER REPRESENTATION\n\n3\n\nProof. A proof of the first equivalence may be found in, for example, [3]. The second\nequivalence is an easy exercise about free groups and is left to the reader.\n\u0003\n\u00b11\n2.3. The congruence subgroup. Denote the subgroup of GLn (Z[t\u00b11\n1 , . . . , tn ])\nconsisting of those matrices A with A \u2261 In modulo (t1 \u2212 1, t2 \u2212 1, . . . , tn \u2212 1) by\n\u00b11\nKn (i.e., Kn = GLn (R, J) for R = Z[t\u00b11\n1 , . . . , tn ] and J the augmentation ideal).\nNote that the image of Pn under Gn lies in Kn . The group Kn is filtered by powers\nof J:\nKni = {A \u2208 Kn : A \u2261 In mod J i }.\nThis is a central series: [Kni , Knj ] \u2286 Kni+j .\nConsider the graded quotients Kni /Kni+1 . Note that \u0393i Kn \u2286 Kni , but it is probably not true that Kn\u2022 is the lower central series (for R = Z[t, t\u22121 ], the corresponding\ngroup Kn has Kni /\u0393i Kn a torsion group for n \u2265 4 [7]). Consider the induced map\n\n\u03a6i : \u0393i Fn\u22121 /\u0393i+1 Fn\u22121 \u2212\u2192 Kni /Kni+1 .\nThen by Proposition 2.1, we have the following:\nGn is injective if \u03a6i is injective for all i \u2265 1.\nWe show in Section 3 that \u03a6k is injective for k \u2264 4, but that injectivity fails for\nk = 5.\n2.4. Structure of Kni /Kni+1 . Given A \u2208 Kni , we may write\nX\nA \u2261 In +\n(tl1 \u2212 1) * * * (tli \u2212 1)Al1 ,...,li mod J i+1 ,\n1\u2264l1 \u2264***\u2264li \u2264n\n\nwhere Al1 ,...,li \u2208 Mn (Z). Define\n\u03c0i : Kni \u2212\u2192\n\nM\n\nMn (Z)\n\n1\u2264l1 \u2264***\u2264li \u2264n\n\nby\n\u03c0i (A) = (Al1 ,...,li )1\u2264l1 \u2264***\u2264li \u2264n .\n\u03c0i is clearly a homomorphism and ker\u03c0i = Kni+1 .\nDenote by elm (a) the matrix having a in the l, m position and zeroes elsewhere.\nNote that \u03c01 is surjective:\n\u03c01 (In + elm (tj \u2212 1)) = (0, . . . , 0, elm (1), 0, . . . , 0)\nwhere elm (1) appears in the summand corresponding to (tj \u2212 1). Note that this\n\u00b11\nworks for l = m as 1 + (tj \u2212 1) = tj is a unit in Z[t\u00b11\n1 , . . . , tn ]. For i > 1, the\n0\nimage of \u03c0i is the sum of copies of Mn (Z) (matrices of trace 0):\n\u03c0i (In + elm ((tj1 \u2212 1) * * * (tji \u2212 1))) = (0, . . . , 0, elm (1), 0, . . . , 0)\noccurring in the summand corresponding to the monomial (tj1 \u2212 1) * * * (tji \u2212 1) for\nl 6= m. Also, we can hit el,l (1) \u2212 el+1,l+1 (1) since\n\uf8ee 1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\nU =\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\n..\n\n.\n\n1\n1 + (tj1 \u2212 1) * * * (tji \u2212 1)\n(tj1 \u2212 1) * * * (tji \u2212 1)\n\n\u2212(tj1 \u2212 1) * * * (tji \u2212 1)\n1 \u2212 (tj1 \u2212 1) * * * (tji \u2212 1)\n\n1\n..\n\n.\n1\n\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa \u2208 Kni\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\n\f4\n\nKEVIN P. KNUDSON\n\nand \u03c0i (U ) = el,l (1) \u2212 el+1,l+1 (1) + el+1,l (1) \u2212 el,l+1 (1).\n3. The Main Result\nLet us now investigate the map \u03a6i : \u0393i Fn\u22121 /\u0393i+1 Fn\u22121 \u2192 Kni /Kni+1 . When we\nrefer to a \"factor\" we mean the copy of Mn (Z) or Mn0 (Z) in Kni /Kni+1 corresponding\nto a certain monomial (tj1 \u2212 1) * * * (tji \u2212 1); we will abbreviate this monomial to\ntj1 * * * tji .\nNow, we have\n\u03a61 (xr ) =\n\n(err (1) + enr (\u22121), ern (\u22121) + enn (1))\ntn\ntr\n\nwhere the monomial under an entry indicates the factor in which it lies. For 1 \u2264\nr \u2264 n \u2212 1, these elements are clearly linearly independent in Kn /Kn2 = Mn (Z), and\nso \u03a61 is injective.\nOn the second level we have, for r > s,\n\u03a62 ([xr , xs ]) = (esr (\u22121) + enr (1), ers (1) + ens (\u22121), ern (\u22121) + esn (1))\nts tn\ntr tn\ntr ts\nand these are clearly linearly independent in Kn2 /Kn3 . So \u03a62 is injective as well.\nTo calculate \u03a63 , we must order the bases of Fn\u22121 /\u03932 Fn\u22121 and \u03932 Fn\u22121 /\u03933 Fn\u22121 .\nUse the obvious order on the first level: xn\u22121 > xn\u22122 > * * * > x1 .

Suppose\nX\n\nmrsu crsu = 0\n\nfor some mrsu \u2208 Z. If s = u, the factor t2s tr = tr ts tu comes into play and does not\noccur in any other crsu . So mrsu = 0 in this case. Similarly if r = u, the factor\nt2r ts = tr ts tu comes into play and does not occur in any other crsu and so mrsu = 0\nhere as well.\nP\nThus, we may assume we have mrsu crsu = 0 where each of the crsu has distinct\nr, s, u. For a given fixed r, s, u, the factor tr ts tu occurs exactly twice-in crsu\nand cusr . The corresponding elements are ern (\u22121) + esn (1) and eun (\u22121) + esn (1),\n\n\fON THE KERNEL OF THE GASSNER REPRESENTATION\n\n5\n\nrespectively. As r =\n6 u, these are linearly independent in Mn (Z), and so we must\nhave mrsu = musr = 0 in this case as well.\n\u0003\n\nNow let's look at \u03a64 .

Denote the image of an element above\nunder \u03a64 by crsuv .

The elements {crsuv } are linearly independent in Kn4 /Kn5 .\nP\nProof. Suppose\nmrsuv crsuv = 0 for some mrsuv \u2208 Z. Consider the case where\nonly 2 of the r, s, u, v are distinct (e.g. c2111 , c3133 , etc.). Then crsuv contributes to\nthe factor tr ts tu tv = tki tlj where i and j are the distinct indices and 1 \u2264 k, l \u2264 3,\nk + l = 4. Note that crsuv is the only contributor to this factor as the choice of\nr determines the sequence-the only possibilities are rsrr, rsss or rssr (note that\nno [[xr , xs ], [xu , xv ]] occur as r 6= s, u 6= v implies that r = u and s = v and so the\nelement is 0). To this factor, crsuv contributes ern (\u22121) + esn (1). It follows that\nmrsuv = 0 for these elements.\nNow suppose that crsuv = \u03a6([[[xr , xs ], xu ], xv ]) with r, s, u, v distinct (we shall\ndeal with the double commutators with 4 distinct indices below). Then crsuv contributes the element ern (\u22121) + esn (1) to the factor tr ts tu tv . For fixed r, s, u, v, we\nmust have r > s and s < u < v if they are all distinct. So the only contributors\nto this factor are (1) crsuv , (2) cusrv or cusvr (the latter if v < r), (3) cvsru or\ncvsur (the latter if u < r); and they contribute ern (\u22121) + esn (1), eun (\u22121) + esn (1),\nevn (\u22121) + esn (1) respectively. Since these elements are linearly independent in\nMn (Z), we must have mrsuv = musrv = mvsru = 0.\nNext, suppose that r, s, u, v consist of 3 distinct indices. We have r > s, u \u2265 s,\nand v \u2265 u. There are three cases to consider. Recall that in any case, r > s.\nCase 1. s = u. We may assume (without loss of generality) that r > v and v > u.\nThen we have three possible elements to consider: crssv , cvssr , and crsvs (the latter\ncorresponds to [[xr , xs ], [xv , xs ]]). Here, the factor t2s tv tr receives contributions only\nfrom crssv and cvssr , the elements being ern (\u22121) + esn (1) and evn (\u22121) + esn (1),\nrespectively. These are linearly independent in Mn (Z) and so mrssv = mvssr = 0.\nThen, in the factor t2s tr tn , the only contributors are crssv , cvssr and crsvs -the latter\ncontributing erv (1) + esv (\u22121), while the former two contribute erv (1) + esv (\u22121) and\nevr (1) + esr (\u22121). As we've already shown that mrssv = mvssr = 0, and since the\nonly other crsuv that contribute here only have two distinct indices, we must have\nmrsvs = 0 as well.\nCase 2. u = v. Then u > s. Suppose r > u (the case r < u is Case 3 below). Then\nthe three elements to consider are crsuu , cusur and cruus . The first two elements\n\n\fON THE KERNEL OF THE GASSNER REPRESENTATION\n\n7\n\ncontribute to the factor ts t2u tr the elements ern (\u22121) + esn (1) and eun (\u22121) + esn (1)\nrespectively and no other cijkl contributes to this factor. So mrsuu = musur = 0.\nThen consider the factor t2u tr tn . Here, cruus contributes eru (1) + esu (\u22121) and the\nonly other contributors have mijkl = 0 already. Thus, mruus = 0, as well.\nCase 3. u = v, u > r. This is similar to Case 2.\nFinally, consider the crsuv = \u03a6([[xr , xs ], [xu , xv ]]) with r, s, u, v distinct. Then\nr > s, u > v, r > u. As the indices are distinct the only factors contributed to\nare ts tu tv tn , tr tu tv tn , tr ts tv tn , and tr ts tu tn (see the formulas above). For fixed\nr, s, u, v, the only possible cijkl are given in the following table, along with the\nelements contributed to each factor.\ncrsuv\ncrusv\ncrvsu\n\nts tu tv tn\neur (1) + evr (\u22121)\nesr (1) + evr (\u22121)\nesr (1) + eur (\u22121)\n\ntr tu tv tn\neus (\u22121) + evs (1)\ners (\u22121) + eus (1)\ners (\u22121) + evs (1)\n\ntr ts tv tn\neru (\u22121) + esu (1)\nesu (\u22121) + evu (1)\neru (1) + evu (\u22121)\n\ntr ts tu tn\nerv (1) + esv (\u22121)\nerv (1) + euv (\u22121)\nesv (\u22121) + euv (1)\n\nIn each factor, we obtain linearly dependent elements, but we must remember\nthat we're scaling the element coming from crsuv by mrsuv . Looking at the factor\nts tu tv tn , we find that mrsuv = mrvsu and mrusv = \u2212mrvsu . But then looking\nat the factor tr tu tv tn , we find mrsuv = \u2212mrvsu and mrusv = \u2212mrvsu . Thus,\nmrsuv = mrusv = mrvsu = 0.\nThis completes the proof.\n\u0003\nCorollary 3.3. The kernel of gn is contained in \u03935 Fn\u22121 .\n\n\u0003\n\nIt is possible to sharpen Corollary 3.3 to obtain the main result.\nTheorem 3.4. The kernel of gn is contained in [\u03933 Fn\u22121 , \u03932 Fn\u22121 ].\nProof. For simplicity, denote the group \u0393i Fn\u22121 by \u0393i . By Corollary 3.3 and by [8],\nwe have ker(gn ) \u2286 \u03935 \u2229 [\u03932 , \u03932 ]. We claim that the latter group equals [\u03933 , \u03932 ]. The\nmain theorem in [6] implies that\n\u03935 \u2229 [\u03932 , \u03932 ] = I\u03932 ([\u03933 , \u03932 ]),\nwhere IR (S) is the isolator of S in R. (Recall that the isolator of S in R is the\nset IR (S) = {x \u2208 R : xn \u2208 S for some n}.) To see that this latter group is simply [\u03933 , \u03932 ], it suffices to show that the quotient group \u03932 /[\u03933 , \u03932 ] is torsion-free.\nConsider the short exact sequence\n1 \u2212\u2192\n\n\u03932\n\u03932\n[\u03932 , \u03932 ]\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192 1.\n[\u03933 , \u03932 ]\n[\u03933 , \u03932 ]\n[\u03932 , \u03932 ]\n\nSince \u03932 is a free group, the group \u03932 /[\u03932 , \u03932 ] is free abelian. But, by Theorem 6\nof [5], the group [\u03932 , \u03932 ]/[\u03933 , \u03932 ] is also free abelian. It follows that \u03932 /[\u03933 , \u03932 ] is\ntorsion-free. This completes the proof.\n\u0003\nThe methods used above allow us to prove the following result.\nTheorem 3.5. For s \u2265 5, ker(gn ) \u2229 \u0393s \u2286 [\u0393s\u22122 , \u03932 ] * \u0393s+1 .\nProof. Note that any basic commutator is given by a unique list of integers corresponding to the xj that occur in the commutator. For example, [[x3 , x2 ], [x3 , x1 ]]\nyields the list 3, 2, 3, 1. We therefore may denote a basic commutator of weight s\nby xl1 l2 ***ls without confusion. Denote the element \u03a6s (xl1 l2 ***ls ) by cl1 l2 ***ls . Note\n\n\f8\n\nKEVIN P. KNUDSON\n\nthat all the basic commutators in \u0393s /\u0393s+1 lie in [\u0393s\u22122 , \u03932 ], except for the various\n[cu , xj ]. Moreover, any element of the latter form must be an s-fold commutator:\nxl1 l2 ***ls = [* * * [[[xl1 , xl2 ], xl3 ], * * * ], xls ].\nTo prove the theorem, it suffices to show that if we have a dependency relation\nX\nml1 l2 ***ls cl1 l2 ***ls = 0\nwhere the ml1 ***ls \u2208 Z, then we have ml1 ***ls = 0 whenever xl1 ***ls is an s-fold\ncommutator. This will show that the [cu , xj ] inject into Kns /Kns+1 and hence that\nthe intersection of the kernel of gn with \u0393s lies in [\u0393s\u22122 , \u03932 ] * \u0393s+1 .\nObserve that in the case of an s-fold commutator, the element cl1 ***ls contributes\nthe element el1 ,n (\u22121) + el2 ,n (1) to the factor tl1 tl2 * * * tls (this is easily proved\nby induction using the formulas given above for the cj and crs ). Suppose the\nl1 , l2 , . . . , ls consist of i distinct indices, say r1 = l1 , r2 = l2 , and r3 , . . . , ri . We\nhave r1 > r2 and r2 < r3 < * * * < ri . We have several contributors to the factor\ntl1 tl2 * * * tls = tar11 tar22 * * * tarii (here ak is the number of times rk occurs). Let us abbreviate notation and write cr1 r2 ***ri for cl1 ***ls . Certain permutations of the lj yield\ns-fold basic commutators; each of these contributes to the factor tar11 tar22 * * * tarii under\nconsideration. We must show that the resulting contributions are linearly independent. Note that the only contributors to this factor are s-fold commutators-if\nc = [cu , cv ] where w(cv ) \u2265 2, then every factor to which c contributes contains a\npower of tn (see the formulas above). Thus, we may detect any dependency relation\namong the cl1 ,...,ls by considering only the factor tl1 * * * tls .\nNow, for some q with 3 \u2264 q \u2264 i we must have rq < r1 < rq+1 . Then we get the\nfollowing contributions to the factor tar11 tar22 * * * tarii :\nsequence\nr1 , r2 , . . . , ri\nrq , r2 , . . . , rq\u22121 , r1 , rq+1 , . . . , ri\nrq+1 , r2 , . . . , rq , r1 , rq+2 , * * * , ri\nrq+2 , r2 , . . . , rq , r1 , rq+1 , rq+3 , . . . , ri\n..\n.\n\nelement\ner1 ,n (\u22121) + er2 ,n (1)\nerq ,n (\u22121) + er2 ,n (1)\nerq+1 ,n (\u22121) + er2 ,n (1)\nerq+2 ,n (\u22121) + er2 ,n (1)\n..\n.\n\nri , r2 , . . . , rq , r1 , rq+1 , . . . , ri\u22121\n\neri ,n (\u22121) + er2 ,n (1)\n\nSince r1 , r2 , . . . , ri are distinct, the elements in the second column are linearly independent in Mn (Z) (as i < n) and so each of the corresponding coefficients satisfies\n\u0003\nml1 ***ls = 0. This completes the proof.\n4. Breakdown\nThe method used in Section 3 breaks down at the fifth level, however. Indeed, if\nn = 4, the kernel of \u03a65 is rather large. For example, we have c21131 = c31121 . This\nhas the interpretation that the degree 5 part of the polynomials in the Gassner\nmatrices of\n[[[A24 , A14 ], A14 ], [A34 , A14 ]]\nand\n[[[A34 , A14 ], A14 ], [A24 , A14 ]]\nare the same. The matrices are not the same, however, and a computer search\nby the author based on the relations in the kernel of \u03a65 has not turned up any\nelements in the kernel of G4 .\n\n\fON THE KERNEL OF THE GASSNER REPRESENTATION\n\n9\n\nNote, however, that the failure of the method does not imply that gn is not\ninjective. Really, one needs to consider the quotients \u0393i gn (Fn\u22121 )/\u0393i+1 gn (Fn\u22121 )\nrather than the classes of the various elements in \u0393i gn (Fn\u22121 ) modulo the subgroup\nKni+1 . This seems to be rather intractable, however, given the ranks of the various\n\u0393i Fn\u22121 /\u0393i+1 Fn\u22121 (for example, \u03935 F3 /\u03936 F3 has rank 116).\nReferences\n[1] M.
