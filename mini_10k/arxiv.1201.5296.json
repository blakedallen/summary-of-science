As compact systems with relatively homogeneous properties, their stellar and dynamical histories can be modeled\nwith reasonable accuracy, at least compared to their parent galaxies. Studies of extragalactic star\nclusters have experienced a major step forward with the availability of the Hubble Space Telescope,\nwhich provided the spatial resolution necessary to identify clusters in distant galaxies and resolve\nthose in nearby galaxies into individual stars, and large ground-based telescopes, which provide\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nthe light-gathering power to study these faint objects spectroscopically. The study of extragalactic\nGCs has provided important clues to the process of galaxy assembly and complements the direct\nstudy of high-redshift galaxies (Brodie & Strader 2006).\nStar clusters also provide important tests of simple stellar population (SSP) models constructed\nvia population synthesis methods. Although the evidence is now overwhelming that globular clusters are not single-age, single-metallicity populations as previously believed (see the review by\nBragaglia 2010), they are still less complex than the population mix found in even the smallest galaxies. As such, they provide important observational tests for population synthesis models, and there\nhave been many examples of such tests (Peacock et al. 2011; Riffel et al. 2010; Conroy & Gunn\n2010; Pessev et al. 2008; Barmby & Huchra 2000; Bica & Alloin 1986). Although becoming increasingly important in the study of nearby stellar populations (e.g. Sheth et al. 2010), and having\nthe advantage of reduced extinction sensitivity, the model predictions at mid-infrared wavelengths\n\u03bb & 3 \u03bcm, have not been well-tested. Mid-infrared observations from ground-based telescopes are\nimpractical for all but the brightest sources, due to the high background, and the existing stellar libraries may not yet be adequate (although see Vandenbussche et al. 2002; Sloan et al. 2003;\nHodge et al. 2004). The ATLAS9 model atmospheres, on which many population synthesis models\nare at least partly based, have line opacity spectra calculated to a maximum wavelength of 10 \u03bcm.\nModeling infrared stellar spectra with a Rayleigh-Jeans law is quite common (e.g. Zasowski et al.\n2009), but this is \"clearly a crude approximation\" (Marigo et al. 2008). Those authors state that\nbolometric corrections for the coolest stars are uncertain by up to a few tenths of a magnitude.\nIn their investigation on the use of model atmospheres for infrared calibration, Decin & Eriksson\n(2007) found that model spectra are accurate to 3% in the mid-IR but also noted that \"for the\npurpose of calculating theoretical spectra in the mid to far-IR, some line lists are still far from\ncomplete or accurate\".\nThe Spitzer Space Telescope probes these mid-infrared wavelengths. While young star clusters\nhave been the subject of numerous investigations with Spitzer (e.g. Gutermuth et al. 2009), there\nhas been relatively little analysis of the mid-infrared properties of old star clusters. Old star clusters'\ndeclining spectral energy distribution in the mid-infrared, in combination with the presumed lack\nof interesting spectral features, is presumably the reason for this lack of attention. Mid-infrared\nobservations have been used in studies of mass-losing stars in individual clusters (Boyer et al.\n2006, 2008, 2010; Origlia et al. 2007, 2010) as well as searches for cold dust in the intracluster\nmedium (Matsunaga et al. 2008; Barmby et al. 2009). One of the few studies of extragalactic\nglobular cluster systems is that of Spitler et al. (2008). The present paper provides mid-infrared\nphotometry of massive globular clusters in the Andromeda galaxy, M31, taken with the Spitzer\nSpace Telescope, and compares them to population synthesis models which predict magnitudes in\nthe IRAC bands, namely GALEV (Kotulla et al. 2009), FSPS (Conroy et al. 2009) and models from\nthe Padova group (Marigo et al. 2008). Only the four IRAC bands are used here. M31 clusters are\ngenerally too faint to be detected in the MIPS observations of Gordon et al. (2005), and photometry\nof the handful of Milky Way clusters observed with the MIPS instrument is published elsewhere\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n(Boyer et al. 2006, 2008; Barmby et al. 2009).\nThroughout this work we use the Vega magnitude system and assume a distance to M31 of\n780 kpc (McConnachie et al. 2005), for which 1\u2032\u2032 corresponds to 3.78 pc.\n\n2.\n2.1.\n\nData and Models\nCluster Mass Limit\n\nStar clusters contain a limited number of stars and photometry of star clusters must consider\nstochastic effects (Buzzoni 1989; Renzini 1998). The integrated light of a cluster can be dominated\nby a few bright stars, particularly in the infrared where the luminosity of the asymptotic giant\nbranch is highest (Fouesneau & Lan\u00e7on 2010). For this first comparison of star cluster photometry\nwith SSP models in the mid-infrared, we wanted to avoid stochastic effects as much as possible,\nso we sought to select only the most massive clusters. One criterion for choosing a selection limit\nis the lowest luminosity limit (LLL) defined by Cervi\u00f1o & Luridiana (2004). This limit is defined\nfor a specific SSP model as the luminosity of the brightest star included in the model, at the age,\nmetallicity, and wavelength under consideration. For 10 Gyr old clusters, Cervi\u00f1o & Luridiana\n(2004) found the total mass corresponding to the LLL in the K-band to be approximately 105 M\u2299 ;\nthose authors showed that a total mass of about 10 times this limit is required in order for stochastic\neffects to cause less than a 10% dispersion in the total luminosity.\nRelated to the LLL approach is the concept of the \"effective number of stars\" emitting at\n\u22121/2\na given wavelength, introduced by Buzzoni (1989). With Neff defined via \u03b4Ltot /Ltot = Neff ,\nthe value of Neff for a 10% uncertainty in luminosity is Neff = (0.1)\u22122 = 100. For a 10% color\nuncertainty, assuming the same Neff for both bands, Neff \u2265 200 (Buzzoni 2005). The Evolutionary\nPopulation Synthesis (EPS) website1 tabulates model predictions of Neff (\u03bb) as a function of age for\npopulations with Lbol = 1010 L\u2299 . For ages of 10\u201315 Gyr, typical values of Neff (4 \u03bcm) range from\n106.6 \u2212 106.85 depending on the metallicity, IMF and horizontal branch treatment; for ages of 5\nGyr, Neff (4 \u03bcm) \u223c 106.4 . To scale Neff from Lbol = 1010 L\u2299 to a fixed mass, we used the M/Lbol\ntabulated by the EPS models. For [M/H] = \u22121.27, a typical value for the globular clusters under\nconsideration, Neff values for a 106 M\u2299 population are 300 (15 Gyr), 270 (10 Gyr), and 260 (8\nGyr). These suggest that clusters with masses of 106 M\u2299 should not have their integrated mid-IR\nphotometry strongly affected by stochastic effects, while clusters with mass 105 M\u2299 would have\nNeff well below the requirements. We used this result to set our lower mass limit at 106 M\u2299 .\n1\n\nhttp://www.bo.astro.it/$\\sim$eps/home.html\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n2.2.\n\nCluster Sample Selection\n\nFor this first comparison between SSP models and star cluster colors, we wanted to remove\nage as a variable if possible, and select only old clusters. The clusters we considered all belong\nto the Milky Way, M31, or the LMC. While many other Local Group dwarf galaxies have a few\nglobular clusters each (see the compilation by Forbes et al. 2000), the few available estimates of\nthose clusters' masses in the literature show the largest of them to have masses about 105 M\u2299 .\nM33 has numerous star clusters, with a recent catalogue given by Sarajedini & Mancone (2007);\nhowever it has few truly old clusters, and few clusters with mass estimates comparable to those\navailable in other galaxies. For Milky Way globular clusters we take the inclusion of a cluster in\nthe catalog of Harris (2010) to mean that its age is & 10 Gyr. For LMC clusters we considered\nonly clusters classified as having ages > 10 Gyr by Pessev et al. (2008); these ages were compiled\nfrom the results of color-magnitude diagram (CMD) fitting. Age determination for M31 clusters\nis more difficult, and, with one exception (Brown et al. 2004), CMD-fitting ages from the main\nsequence turnoff are not available. Perina et al. (2011) noted that deriving M31 cluster ages from\nintegrated spectroscopy can be problematic. They found that two clusters previously suspected to\nbe of intermediate age based on integrated spectra had blue horizontal branches and were likely of\ncomparable age to the oldest Galactic GCs. They also found significant differences between ages\ndetermined from spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting and the CMD analysis. With the caveat\nthat ages from spectroscopy may be unreliable, a uniform determination of ages for the M31 GCs\nreduces scatter due to mixing of different methods, and we use the values by Caldwell et al. (2011)\nas the basis for selecting our sample. These were derived by comparing Lick indices from integrated\nspectroscopy to the SSP models of Schiavon (2007). An important limitation of this analysis is\nthat ages could not be determined for clusters with metallicities [Fe/H] . \u22121. It is possible that\nsome younger clusters could be lurking in the sample, although we considered only M31 clusters\nthat had not been identified as young by any previous work.\nThere are a number of methods for estimating the total mass of a star cluster. While velocity\ndispersions either from integrated spectra or spectra of individual stars provide the most direct measurements of the gravitational potential of a cluster, such measurements are not available for many\nLocal Group star clusters, particularly in M31 which has the largest population. A more widelyapplicable method involves measuring the total luminosity and multiplying by a mass-to-light ratio.\nTotal luminosity can be measured by either large-aperture photometry or fitting and extrapolation\nof a surface brightness profile. For M31 clusters, a comprehensive set of mass estimates is available\nin the work of Caldwell et al. (2011), who estimated masses by multiplying reddening-corrected V band luminosities (from Caldwell et al. 2009) by M/LV = 2. With the goal of selecting a uniform\nsample, we used these mass estimates exclusively to select the final M31 sample; a few additional\noutlying clusters for which masses were not given by Caldwell et al. (2011) but which have mass\nestimates in their online catalog (G001, B358, MGC-1, B468, B293) were also included. For Milky\nWay and LMC clusters, we used near-infrared Ks -band magnitudes as given by Cohen (2006) and\nPessev et al. (2006, 2008). The near-infrared is often used as an indicator of stellar mass in studies\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nof external galaxies since it is expected to be dominated by low-mass stars and is not strongly\nsensitive to recent star formation (Bell & de Jong 2001). The clusters' magnitude were converted\nto luminosities using M\u2299,Ks = 3.29 (Blanton & Roweis 2007) and multiplied by (M/L)Ks = 0.9\nin solar units, the lower end of the range quoted for single-metallicity populations by Maraston\n(2005). We also considered cluster masses derived from fitting of optical surface brightness profiles\nby McLaughlin & van der Marel (2005); these masses are primarily derived from V -band observations (corrected for extinction) and assume (M/L)V = 2 (McLaughlin 2000). Some Milky Way\nclusters (particularly core-collapse candidates) are missing from the McLaughlin & van der Marel\n(2005) database.\nWe combined the two methods to select a final list of massive Local Group globular clusters.\nExcluding the anomalous cluster \u03c9 Cen, only a handful of Milky Way clusters have masses >\n106 M\u2299 : NGC 104, NGC 6388, NGC 6441, and NGC 6715. A further 8 Milky Way clusters\n(NGC 2808, NGC 7089, NGC 2419, NGC 6266, NGC 6273, NGC 6356, NGC 6402, NGC 6440)\nand two Magellanic Cloud clusters (NGC 1835, NGC 1916) had masses likely to be above 5\u00d7105 M\u2299 .\nBut nearly all of the massive Local Group globular clusters belong to M31, a total of 58 objects.\nAfter examining the available Spitzer/IRAC data for Milky Way and LMC clusters, we eventually\ndecided against using data on those galaxies' GCs in our analysis: the Milky Way cluster data had\ntechnical issues (long frametimes and in-place repeats) as well as only covering a single 5\u2032 \u00d7 5\u2032 field\nof view in all four IRAC bands. The LMC clusters NGC 1916 is located near a region of diffuse\nemission, making background subtraction for this cluster extremely difficult. IRAC photometry of\na larger sample of LMC clusters has been reported by Pessev et al. (2010).\n\n2.3.\n\nIRAC Observations and Photometry\n\nThe M31 bulge and some of the brightest M31 clusters had individual deep Spitzer/IRAC\nobservations as part of PID 3400 (PI M. Rich). These images also include a number of additional\nclusters fortuitously located near the target clusters. The data were taken with 30-second frame\ntimes, 22 dither positions with 4 frames per position, and so have overall depths of about 40\nminutes per sky position. Saturation limits for IRAC images with these frametimes are in the\nrange 8 < mVega < 11 (Spitzer Science Center 2010). The brightest GCs in M31 have Ks \u223c 11\n(Galleti et al. 2004), so saturation of the clusters was not expected to be an issue. We retrieved the\ndata from the Spitzer Heritage Archive and used the post-BCD mosaics as produced by versions\n18.7 and 18.18 of the pipeline.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n\nB225\n\nB178\n\nB338\n\nB012\n\n20 arcsec\n\nFig. 1.- IRAC 3.6\u03bcm (top) and 8.0\u03bcm (bottom) images of M31 globular clusters. All images\nare 90\u2032\u2032 square with north up and east to the left. The clusters range from Ks \u223c 11.5 (B225) to\nKs \u223c 13.3 (B178). The left two panels show clusters in the shallow M31 mosaic (PID 3126) while\nthe right two panels show clusters observed in deeper images (PID 3400).\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nThe main observational dataset for the M31 clusters comprises the IRAC mosaics taken as\npart of program PID 3126, described in Barmby et al. (2006). In brief, the observations cover a\ntotal area of about 3.\u25e6 7 \u00d7 1.\u25e6 0 along the major axis of M31, with an extension to include NGC 205.\nThe central portion of the disk was covered to a depth of six 12-second frames per position, and the\nouter area by four 30-second frames per position. The mosaics used for this analysis are improved\nversions of the mosaics used by Barmby et al. (2006) and are described by Mould et al. (2008). Of\nthe 58 clusters in our list of massive M31 globulars, 11 were imaged in all four bands in the deep\nPID3400 data, 41 were imaged only on the shallow M31 mosaics, two objects (B405, MGC-1) had\nno IRAC images available, and 3 objects (B240, B381, B383) were at the edge of the mosaic image\nand had only noisy data in 4.5 and 8.0 \u03bcm available. Cluster B095 is located about 7\u2032\u2032 from a much\nbrighter star and is contaminated by detector artifacts due to the star; we judged that obtaining\nreliable photometry in the IRAC bands was not possible. The final sample of M31 clusters analyzed\nhere therefore has a total of 52 members. Sample IRAC images of M31 globular clusters are shown\nin Figure 1.\nThe typical half-light radius of an M31 GC is Rh \u223c 3 pc, or about 0.75\u2032\u2032 (Peacock et al. 2010;\nBarmby et al. 2007). While this is smaller than the full-width at half-maximum of the IRAC point\nspread function (PSF), it is large enough that M31 GCs appear slightly resolved (see Figure 1).\nAperture photometry is thus more appropriate for these objects than PSF-fitting photometry. But\nhow do we best account for the different PSF in the different IRAC bands, and decide which\naperture should be used? From the point of view of capturing all of the light from a cluster, a\nlarge aperture is desirable. Use of 'total' magnitudes also facilitates comparison between widelyseparated wavelength regimes, where not only the PSF but the apparent cluster structure, may\ndiffer (see Cohen 2006, for a discussion of the subtleties in aperture-matching). However, the use\nof a large aperture would result in low signal-to-noise in 5.8 and 8.0 \u03bcm bands, where the clusters\nare faint and the background bright. Using smaller apertures has the problem that the different\nPSF results in aperture corrections that are not the same in all bands.\nTo deal with the aperture issues, we took two approaches to photometry of the M31 clusters.\nTo compute IRAC-only colors, we computed aperture magnitudes in a relatively small apertures,\nand dealt with the variable PSF by convolving the images in the 3.6, 4.5, and 5.8 \u03bcm bands\nto the 8.0 \u03bcm resolution. (A similar approach was used by Clemens et al. 2009, in their study\nof near-to-mid-infrared colors of Coma cluster galaxies.) For colors which combine the 3.6 and\n4.5 \u03bcm bands with visible-light or near-infrared bands, we measured 'total' IRAC magnitudes\nin a standard large aperture. Convolution was done using the IRAF fconvolve task and the\nconvolution kernels described by Gordon et al. (2008). For the clusters observed as part of the\nlarge mosaics, we extracted 2.5\u2032 \u00d7 2.5\u2032 'postage stamp' images and convolved these, rather than\nattempting to convolve the original mosaics. We compared aperture photometry on the original and\nconvolved deep images to show that the convolution performed as expected: the median difference\nin aperture magnitudes between convolved and unconvolved images was close to the difference\nbetween aperture corrections between the convolved band and the 8.0 \u03bcm band as tabulated in\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n\n10\n\nNumber\n\n8\n6\n4\n2\n01.0\n\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\n3.5\nRadius containing 90% of light [arcsec]\n\n4.0\n\nFig. 2.- Distribution of R90 -the radius containing 90% of the integrated light, in projection-\nfor M31 globular clusters.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nthe IRAC Instrument Handbook (Spitzer Science Center 2010). To choose a small aperture size,\nwe used the results of surface brightness profile fitting from Hubble Space Telescope images of M31\nglobular clusters (Barmby et al. 2007) to compute R90 , the projected radius containing 90% of the\nintegrated light, for each cluster. Figure 2 shows the distribution of R90 for the 34 clusters from\nour sample analyzed by Barmby et al. (2007). The median of the R90 distribution is 2.\u2032\u2032 5, with a\nmaximum of 3.\u2032\u2032 7. These values refer to the intrinsic profile before convolution with the HST PSF;\nthe effects of the Spitzer/IRAC PSF are more significant and mean that R90 as observed in IRAC\nimages will be larger. To maximize signal-to-noise and still include a significant fraction of cluster\nlight, we chose one of the standard IRAC aperture sizes, a radius of 3.\u2032\u2032 66.\nAperture photometry was performed using the IRAF/APPHOT package. Flux was measured\nin circular apertures of radii 3.\u2032\u2032 66 (and 12.\u2032\u2032 2 for the 3.6 and 4.5 \u03bcm bands only), with background\nmeasured in an annulus of inner and outer radii 3.\u2032\u2032 6\u20138.\u2032\u2032 5 (14.\u2032\u2032 6\u201324.\u2032\u2032 4) subtracted. This background\nannulus for the small aperture is the smaller of two tabulated in the Instrument Handbook. We\nused it because a few clusters had nearby diffuse emission which could bias the background estimate\nin a larger annulus. We verified that in most cases the choice of background annulus had no effect\non the resulting photometry. Calibration to the Vega system was made using the Vega IRAC-band\nflux densities given by the Spitzer Science Center. Uncertainties on the photometric measurements\nwere estimated using the formula in apphot/phot, with a correction to the background noise\nterm which accounts for the correlated noise introduced by pixel re-sampling during mosaicing.\nAs the background variation is by far the dominant source of noise in these measurements, this\nis an important correction. Table 1 gives the photometry. We checked the internal consistency of\nthe photometry by comparing measurements of the same clusters on the deep and shallow IRAC\nimages. There is some scatter between the two image types, but magnitude offsets are consistent\nwith zero. In the 4 IRAC bands, the offsets are (mean \u00b1 standard deviation): \u22120.03\u00b10.04, \u22120.06\u00b1\n0.08, \u22120.06 \u00b1 0.07, \u22120.06 \u00b1 0.09.\n\n2.4.\n\n2MASS Photometry and Extinction Correction\n\nWhile globular clusters have not been extensively observed in the mid-infrared, there is a\nlong history of using them to test population synthesis models in the near-infrared, so it is of\ninterest to connect these two regimes. The most widely-used near-infrared photometric system is\nthat of 2MASS (Skrutskie et al. 2006), and the 2MASS data on M31 GCs has been examined by\nGalleti et al. (2004) and Nantais et al. (2006). Peacock et al. (2010) also presented observations of\nM31 GCs in the Ks band based on deeper UKIRT imaging. We chose to re-measure the M31 GC\nmagnitudes on the 2MASS '6x' Atlas images because the observations of Peacock et al. (2010) only\ncovered 60% of our cluster sample, the compilation of Galleti et al. (2004) used the original shallow\n2MASS images of M31, and the compilation of Nantais et al. (2006) used the 2MASS Point Source\nCatalog, which might be inappropriate for the larger M31 clusters. To maintain consistency with\nthe colors measured using the IRAC data, we retrieved 2MASS images of the M31 GCs and used\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nthese to measure aperture magnitudes with the same large photometric and background apertures\nused for the IRAC data. We chose to use the large apertures rather than trying to match the spatial\nresolution between IRAC and 2MASS because the temporal variation in the 2MASS PSF makes\nany such matching significantly more complicated. The photometric uncertainties were estimated\nusing the same procedure as for the IRAC magnitudes, which is based on the procedure detailed in\nsection 8av of the 2MASS All-Sky Data Release Explanatory Supplement. Table 1 gives the 2MASS\nKs photometry. We compared our aperture photometry with the total magnitudes measured on\nUKIRT images by Peacock et al. (2010). The UKIRT magnitudes are slightly fainter, with the\nmedian offset 0.08 \u00b1 0.09 mag. This is not too surprising, since we used an aperture slightly\nlarger than most of the apertures used by Peacock et al. (2010). It could result in our 'total'\nKs magnitudes being slightly too bright; however for the purposes of computing 2MASS-to-IRAC\ncolors this effect should cancel out.\nWhile extinction has a much smaller effect on photometry in the mid-infrared than in visiblelight or even the near-infrared, the effect is not completely negligible. The exact shape of the\nextinction law in the mid-infrared appears to vary with position in the Galaxy (Indebetouw et al.\n2005; Rom\u00e1n-Z\u00fa\u00f1iga et al. 2007; Flaherty et al. 2007; Nishiyama et al. 2009; Gao et al. 2009) but\nall of these analyses agree that the extinction at IRAC wavelengths is greater than would be\nexpected from a power-law extrapolation of the near-infrared extinction curve. In the analysis that\nfollows, we correct the cluster colors for extinction using the E(B\u2212V ) values given by Caldwell et al.\n(2011). These values include both foreground extinction and extinction internal to M31. For this\nanalysis we use the bandpass-averaged extinction values of Indebetouw et al. (2005), as tabulated\nin Gao et al. (2009): A3.6 /AKs = 0.56 and A\u03bb /AKs = 0.43 for the other three IRAC bands. We\nassume AKs /E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.35 (Cambr\u00e9sy et al. 2002) and the standard AV /E(B \u2212 V ) = 3.1.\n\n2.5.\n\nPopulation Synthesis Models\n\nWhile there are numerous population synthesis models currently available - two of the most\nwidely-used being Bruzual & Charlot (2003) and Maraston (2005) - to our knowledge only three\nmodels give explicit predictions for magnitudes in the IRAC bandpasses. These are GALEV\n(Kotulla et al. 2009), FSPS (Conroy et al. 2009; Conroy & Gunn 2010), and the SSP models provided by the Padova group through their STEL webserver2 (Marigo et al. 2008; Girardi et al. 2010,\nhereafter referred to as 'Padova'). While many other models can be used to generate predicted\nIRAC magnitudes from spectral energy distributions, using three model families suffices for this\nfirst analysis. These models contain some of the same input ingredients but differ in other ways,\nsuch as the treatment of thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch and horizontal branch stars.\nGALEV also provides chemically consistent modeling of galaxies while the other two do not, although this difference is not relevant for the present study.\n2\n\nhttp://stev.oapd.inaf.it/\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nPopulation synthesis models have mostly focused on the visible-light regime, so it is reasonable\nto ask what the input ingredients of these models are in the infrared. The treatment of red giant\nand asymptotic giant branch stars is expected to be particularly important, since these evolutionary stages dominate the light of old populations, especially in the near-infrared (Buzzoni 1989;\nMaraston 2005, and many others). All three models were consider here use Padova isochrones, so\nan important factor in any different outputs is the stellar libraries. GALEV and FSPS both use the\nBaSeL stellar libraries: version 2.2 for GALEV (Lejeune et al. 1998) and version 3.1 (Westera et al.\n2002) for FSPS. BaSeL is based mainly on the stellar atmosphere models of Kurucz (1992), but\nthose models do not include the coolest stars, so BaSeL also includes model M giant atmospheres\nfrom Fluks et al. (1994) and Bessell et al. (1989, 1991). The Padova SSP models use some of the\nsame input ingredients-newer ATLAS models from Castelli & Kurucz (2003) and the Fluks et al.\n(1994) models-but without going through the BaSeL library. Since the Fluks et al. (1994) models\nextend to wavelengths up to 12.5\u03bcm and the Bessell et al. (1989, 1991) models only to 4.1\u03bcm, we\ncan infer that the former models provide the basis for the predictions tested here; however, this\nis not explicitly stated in any of the model descriptions. The thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant\nbranch can also be an important contributor to the integrated light of star clusters (Maraston\n2005), although it is not expected to be important at globular cluster ages. For these stars, FSPS\nuses empirical spectra from Lan\u00e7on & Mouhcine (2002) while the Padova models use synthetic\nspectra from Loidl et al. (2001). Both the Lan\u00e7on & Mouhcine (2002) and Loidl et al. (2001) spectra extend only to 2.5 \u03bcm. The Padova models extend the AGB spectra beyond 2.5 \u03bcm with a\nRayleigh-Jeans model: FSPS extrapolates carbon star spectra with Aringer et al. (2009) synthetic\nspectra. Kotulla et al. (2009) did not describe any special treatment of TP-AGB stars in GALEV.\nFor all three models, we generated predicted SSP colors in the 2MASS and IRAC bands for\na Salpeter (1955) (0.1 \u2212 100 M\u2299 ) initial mass function3 and ages from 1 Gyr up to the oldest\navailable. We retrieved SSP predictions from the online GALEV interface using all available fixed\nmetallicity values [M/H] = log(Z/Z\u2299 ) = (\u22121.7, \u22120.7, \u22120.3, 0.0, +0.3). For FSPS, we used version\n2.3 of the code to generate predicted magnitudes for simple stellar populations with metallicity\nvalues [M/H] = (\u22121.68, \u22120.69, \u22120.30, 0.0, +0.20). The default options for other parameters were\nused. For the Padova models, we used metallicities of [M/H] = (\u22121.68, \u22120.70, \u22120.30, 0.0, +0.20),\nwith the default parameters: evolutionary tracks from Marigo et al. (2008), with the Girardi et al.\n(2010) case A correction, and no circumstellar dust (although see below). For all models, no intrinsic\ndust extinction was applied. We interpolated the GALEV magnitudes to [M/H] = +0.2 so that all\nthree models represented the same five metallicity values. These metallicity values adequately cover\nthe range of metallicities for clusters in the present sample (\u22121.9 \u2264 [M/H] \u2264 \u22120.1); although M31\nhas lower-metallicity clusters (Caldwell et al. 2011), they are not present among the most massive\nobjects.\n\n3\n\nComparison of all three models' predictions for Salpeter (1955) and Kroupa (2001) initial mass function showed\nthat this choice of IMF has a negligible effect on predicted colors of old stellar populations.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n[3.6]-[4.5]\n\nKs-[3.6]\n\n0.6\n0.6\n0.6\nFSPS\nGALEV\nPDVA\n0.4\n0.4\n0.4\n0.2\n0.2\n0.2\n0.09.0 9.3 9.6 9.9 10.2 0.09.0 9.3 9.6 9.9 10.2 0.09.0 9.3 9.6 9.9 10.2\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n\u00010.1\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0.1\n\n[4.5]-[5.8]\n\n9.0 9.3 9.6 9.9 10.2\n\n0.10\n0.05\n0.00\n\n\u00030.059.0\n\n9.3\n\n9.6\n\n9.9\n\n9.0\n\n0.10\n0.05\n0.00\n\u00040.059.0\n10.2\n\n9.9\n\n[M/H]=+0.20\n0.3\n[M/H]=0.0\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n\u00020.1\n10.2\n9.0 9.3 9.6 9.9 10.2\n\n9.9\n\n0.10\n0.05\n0.00\n\u00050.059.0 9.3 9.6 9.9 10.2\n10.2\n\n[M/H]=-0.30\n[M/H]=-0.70\n[M/H]=-1.70\n\n9.3\n\n9.3\n\n9.6\n\n9.6\n\n[5.8]-[8.0]\n\n0.12\n0.12\n0.12\n0.09\n0.09\n0.09\n0.06\n0.06\n0.06\n0.03\n0.03\n0.03\n0.009.0 9.3 9.6 9.9 10.20.009.0 9.3 9.6 9.9 10.20.009.0 9.3 9.6 9.9 10.2\nlog(Age) [yr]\nlog(Age) [yr]\nlog(Age) [yr]\n\nFig. 3.- Predicted IRAC colors from three population synthesis models, as a function of simple stellar population age. Left column: FSPS Conroy et al. (2009), center column: GALEV\n(Kotulla et al. 2009), right column: Padova (Marigo et al. 2008). The same set of metallicities is\nplotted for all 3 models.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nFigure 3 shows predicted colors from the models as functions of age. At old ages, all models\nshow a rather small range of predicted mid-infrared colors, only a few tenths of a magnitude. Although the colors mostly become slightly bluer with age, the size of this effect is very small. There\nare some systematic differences in the models' predictions, with, in general, the FSPS models predicting the greatest color variations over the displayed age range. While there is general agreement\nthat higher metallicities result in redder colors within a model family, the different models do not\nagree on either the size of this effect or its location. For example, the FSPS Ks \u2212 [3.6] color for\nthe most metal-poor model is redder than the same color for the most metal-rich Padova model.\nEach of the models has at least one metallicity track that behaves differently from others in the\nsame family, but which metallicity is the outlier changes depending on the color and model family.\nSince all three models use the same set of isochrones, the difference in predicted colors must be\ndue to some other factor. One likely contributor is the different spectral libraries used for postmain-sequence stars. Another could be numerical issues surrounding the stability of integration\nover short-lived, but luminous stages (Maraston 2005; Tinsley & Gunn 1976).\nWhile Milky Way globular clusters have not shown evidence for intracluster dust (Matsunaga et al.\n2008; Barmby et al. 2009), mid-infrared observations have provided important evidence for dust in\nthe envelopes of individual mass-losing stars (Boyer et al. 2010; Origlia et al. 2010). So it is reasonable to ask what the effects of dusty mass loss would be on the integrated mid-infrared colors\nof a clusters. The Padova models can optionally include these effects for stars with significant\nmass loss: red supergiants, TP-AGB, and upper-RGB stars (see Marigo et al. 2008, for details).\nFigure 4 shows the result of adding circumstellar dust to the Padova simple stellar populations.\nThis figure shows the Padova models with three different prescriptions for circumstellar dust: silicate dust for M stars and carbon-rich dust for C stars (Bressan et al. 1998), 100% AlOx for M\nstars and 100% amorphous carbon for C stars, and 60% silicate/40% AlOx for M stars and 85%\namorphous carbon/15% SiC for C stars (the latter two both from Groenewegen 2006). Comparing\nwith the right panel of Figure 3 shows that including circumstellar dust emission causes the colors\nto vary more with age (all of the Padova models are plotted with the same time resolution) and\nbecome redder, particularly at the longer wavelengths. These effects are stronger for ages . 8 Gyr:\nmodels at the oldest ages are close in color to the non-circumstellar-dust version. In most cases,\nthe choice of circumstellar dust prescription does not have a large effect on the predicted colors.\nThe exception is [5.8] \u2212 [8.0] where the Bressan et al. (1998) prescription results in bluer colors,\nparticularly at lower metallicity, than either of the two prescriptions from Groenewegen (2006). To\nmaintain compatibility with the other two families, the dusty circumstellar models are not shown\nin the comparison with the cluster data, but these effects will be considered in the discussion.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n0.6\nKs-[3.6]\n\n0.4\n0.2\n\nPDVA/B98\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\nPDVA/G06\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\nPDVA/G06v2\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n\u00060.1\n\u00070.1\n\b0.1\n9.0 9.3 9.6 9.9 10.2 9.0 9.3 9.6 9.9 10.2 9.0 9.3 9.6 9.9 10.2\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.2\n0.2\n0.2\n0.1\n0.1\n0.1\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n9.0 9.3 9.6 9.9 10.2\n9.0 9.3 9.6 9.9 10.2 9.0 9.3 9.6 9.9 10.2\n0.8\n0.8\n0.8\n[M/H]=+0.2\n[M/H]=0.00\n0.6\n0.6\n0.6\n[M/H]=-0.3\n[M/H]=-0.7\n0.4\n0.4\n0.4\n[M/H]=-1.7\n0.2\n0.2\n0.2\n0.09.0 9.3 9.6 9.9 10.20.09.0 9.3 9.6 9.9 10.20.09.0 9.3 9.6 9.9 10.2\nlog(Age) [yr]\nlog(Age) [yr]\nlog(Age) [yr]\n\n[5.8]-[8.0]\n\n[4.5]-[5.8]\n\n[3.6]-[4.5]\n\n0.09.0 9.3 9.6 9.9 10.20.09.0 9.3 9.6 9.9 10.20.09.0 9.3 9.6 9.9 10.2\n\nFig. 4.- Predicted IRAC colors from Padova population synthesis models, as a function of simple\nstellar population age.

Figure 5 shows the distribution of the four colors constructed with bandpasses\nadjacent in wavelength. Overplotted are Gaussians normalized to the same area, with the dataderived means and standard deviations: Ks \u2212 [3.6] = 0.13 \u00b1 0.11, [3.6] \u2212 [4.5] = \u22120.04 \u00b1 0.05,\n[4.5] \u2212 [5.8] = 0.09 \u00b1 0.07 and [5.8] \u2212 [8.0] = 0.09 \u00b1 0.12 (mean \u00b1 standard deviation). Pahre et al.\n(2004) gave theoretical colors of M0 III stars in the IRAC bands of [3.6]\u2212[4.5] = \u22120.15, [4.5]\u2212[5.8] =\n+0.11 and [5.8] \u2212 [8.0] = +0.04. The mean colors of the cluster sample are formally consistent with\nthe naive expectation of zero magnitudes, and in the longer wavelengths with the theoretical colors.\nThe mean [3.6] \u2212 [4.5] color of the clusters is slightly redder than the expected giant color, as are\nthe model colors described in Section 3.2, so we suggest that there may be a problem with the\nvalue given by Pahre et al. (2004). The [3.6] \u2212 [4.5] color shows the narrowest color distribution,\nunsurprising since these two bands have the most similar PSF and do not suffer from any possible\naperture-matching problems between 2MASS and IRAC data. At the longer wavelengths, where\nthe clusters are fainter and the background brighter, the observational uncertainties are larger.\nContributions by diffuse PAH emission could also skew the 5.8 and 8.0 \u03bcm fluxes, although this\nshould be minimized by the close-in background aperture used for photometry.\nAs Figure 3 shows, the expected range of mid-infrared colors for old stellar populations is rather\nsmall, a few tenths of a magnitude. Are the distributions that we measure the result of a single\nintrinsic color, broadened by observational uncertainty? One argument against this is that, for the\nIRAC-only colors, the standard deviations of the color distributions are broader than the average\nphotometric uncertainties, by factors of 1.5\u20132.5. Applying the D'Agostino-Pearson normality test\nto all four color distributions, we can reject the hypothesis of normality in the [3.6] \u2212 [4.5] and\n[5.8] \u2212 [8.0] colors, but not in Ks \u2212 [3.6] or [4.5] \u2212 [5.8]. We also compared the color distributions\nto Gaussians with zero mean and standard deviation given by the average photometric uncertainty\nusing a Kolmorgorov-Smirnov test. In all cases the hypothesis that the observed distributions were\ndrawn from the zero-mean distribution was rejected. We conclude that the cluster colors have some\nintrinsic spread and that the observed distributions are not merely delta functions broadened by\nobservational uncertainty. Mis-estimates of reddening should have only a small effect on colors\nderived from adjacent band and are unlikely to cause significant scatter. A spread in ages is a\npossible reason for a color distribution spread; this is discussed further in Section 3.2. Another\npossible explanation is that the relatively poor spatial resolution of IRAC leads to contamination\nof some clusters' colors by sources nearby in the M31 disk.\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n25\n\n25\n\n20\n\n20\n\n15\n\n15\n\n10\n\n10\n\n5\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0.3\n\n25\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.3\n\nKs-[3.6]\n\n0\n\n0.3\n\n25\n\n20\n\n20\n\n15\n\n15\n\n10\n\n10\n\n5\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0.3\n\n\u000e0.1\n\n0.1\n\n[4.5]-[5.8]\n\n0.3\n\n\u000f00.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.3\n\n[3.6]-[4.5]\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n[5.8]-[8.0]\n\nFig. 5.- Distribution of near- and mid-infrared extinction-corrected colors for massive M31 globular clusters.

Each of the model\nprediction lines represents one model family at a specific age between 2 and 12.5 Gyr. Solid\nblack symbols are individual M31 clusters; open symbols (red in the online version) represent the\nluminosity-weighted mean colors of clusters in quintiles of metallicity.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n3.2.\n\nObserved and model colors\n\nWhile, by design, the M31 clusters in our sample cover a fairly small range in mass, they do\ncover a range of about 2 dex in metallicity. Comparing models to cluster colors as a function of\nmetallicity allows us to see how the ranges of the data and models coincide. Figure 6 shows these\ncomparisons for the same colors as shown in Figure 5. The models plotted are a subset of those\nshown in Figure 3, chosen to represent the range of model colors for ages of 2, 8, and 12.5 Gyr. For\nmetallicity values of the clusters, we used the spectroscopic [Fe/H] measurements of Caldwell et al.\n(2011) and converted to total metallicity with [M/H] = [Fe/H] + 0.94[\u03b1/Fe] (Thomas et al. 2003).\nBeasley et al. (2005) found a large spread in the degree of \u03b1-element enhancement for M31 clusters;\nwe use a typical value of [\u03b1/Fe] = 0.2. As well as data for individual clusters, the Figure also shows\nthe luminosity-weighted mean colors of clusters grouped in quintiles of metallicity. In general, the\nclusters cover a wider range of color than do the models, but the models typically fall within the\nrange of the cluster data. The reddest model in the Ks \u2212 [3.6] and [3.6] \u2212 [4.5] plots is the FSPS\n2 Gyr model, which does not appear to be a good fit to the data; however, the 2 Gyr Padova model\ndoes match the data in Ks \u2212[3.6], as does the 2 Gyr GALEV model in [3.6]\u2212[4.5]. The observational\nscatter in these two colors is large enough that older models are also broadly consistent with the\ndata.\nAt the longer IRAC wavelengths, the range of model colors is very small and the models are\ngenerally in good agreement with each other. In [4.5] \u2212 [5.8], the cluster mean colors are slightly\nredder than all of the models by up to 0.1 mag, but the offset is statistically significant in only\ntwo of the five metallicity bins. The scatter of some objects to redder colors could be due to\nsystematic effects in the photometry (incomplete background subtraction, failure to completely\nmatch apertures with the convolution method), or, more interestingly, it could indicate that some\nclusters' colors are affected by circumstellar dust emission. In [5.8] \u2212 [8.0], the mean cluster colors\nare generally in agreement with the models except possibly at the highest metallicity. For the most\npart, the redder colors predicted by the Padova models for stars with circumstellar dust do not\nappear to match the cluster data. This lends support to the idea that these clusters are truly old\nobjects and their infrared light is not dominated by emission from circumstellar dust.\nOptical to near-infrared colors (e.g., V \u2212 Ks ) are good metallicity indicators in old stellar\npopulations, because they are sensitive to the temperature of the red giant branch. Optical-tomid-infrared colors have been less well studied. Spitler et al. (2008) measured V \u2212 [3.6] for GCs in\nNGC 5128 and NGC 4594 and found that this color showed a good correlation with spectroscopic\nmetallicity. To see if the same is true for M31 GCs, we computed optical-to-mid-infrared colors\nusing the V -band photometry tabulated by Caldwell et al. (2009), corrected for extinction using\nthe E(B \u2212 V ) values given by Caldwell et al. (2011). These colors are much more sensitive to\nreddening than the infrared-only colors considered above. Caldwell et al. (2011) estimated the\ntypical reddening uncertainty to be 0.1 mag: changing a reddening estimate by this much would\ncorrespond to a change of nearly 0.3 mag in reddening-corrected V \u2212 Ks .\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\n\n4.5\n\nV-Ks (Vega)\n\n4.0\n3.5\n3.0\n\nFSPS, log(t)=9.3\nFSPS, log(t)=10.1\nGALEV, log(t)=9.3\n\nGALEV, log(t)=10.1\nPDVA, log(t)=9.3\nPDVA, log(t)=10.1\n\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n\n#1.5\n\n$1.0\n\n%0.5\n\n0.0\n\n&1.5\n\n'1.0\n\n(0.5\n\n0.0\n\n)1.5\n\n*1.0\n\n+0.5\n\n0.0\n\nV-[3.6] (Vega)\n\n4.0\n3.5\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n\nV-[4.5] (Vega)\n\n4.5\n4.0\n3.5\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n\nMetallicity [M/H]\n\nFig. 7.- Optical to near/mid-infrared colors (corrected for extinction) as a function of metallicity\nfor massive M31 globular clusters (points) and SSP model predictions (thick lines). Thin lines in\nthe top two panels are fits of V \u2212 Ks against metallicity for Milky Way clusters from Cohen et al.\n(2007) and V \u2212 [3.6] against metallicity for GCs in NGC 5128 and NGC 4594 from Spitler et al.\n(2008). Symbols as in Figure 6; error bars on the data points do not include uncertainties due\nto reddening correction, which could be up to 0.3 mag. The very blue cluster at [M/H] = \u22120.6\nis B037, a cluster with a large (E(B \u2212 V ) & 1.3) and highly uncertain reddening (Caldwell et al.\n2011; Barmby et al. 2002).\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nFigure 7 shows the V \u2212 Ks , V \u2212 [3.6] and V \u2212 [4.5] colors as a function of metallicity for M31\nGCs. Overplotted are the relations predicted by the GALEV, FSPS, and Padova models (ages 2\nand 12 Gyr), as well as fits to the color-metallicity relationships for other GC systems: V \u2212 Ks\nfor Milky Way clusters from Cohen et al. (2007) and V \u2212 [3.6] from Spitler et al. (2008). In all\nthree model families, older models are redder at a given metallicity than younger models. There\nis a significant spread in predicted color with metallicity: the GALEV models are almost always\nredder than the Padova models at a given metallicity, with the FSPS models intermediate. The\nFigure shows that the models do not predict a strictly linear color-metallicity relation for any of\nthe colors; particularly for V \u2212 [3.6] and V \u2212 [4.5], all of the models show a slight change in slope at\n[M/H] = \u22120.7. The empirical fit in V \u2212 Ks captures the model behavior reasonably well, although\nas noted by Conroy & Gunn (2010), the models are redder than the data at high metallicities.\nIn V \u2212 [3.6], the fit matches the models well at high metallicities but is bluer than the models\nat low metallicities. Spitler et al. (2008) found the same result, although interestingly they were\ncomparing to a completely different set of models.\nThe cluster data points plotted in Figure 7 are bluer than the models except at the lowest\nmetallicities. A problem with the photometry does not provide an immediate explanation. Since\nour large-aperture IR magnitudes could slightly overestimate the clusters' brightness (because of\ncontamination by nearby objects), our photometry seems more prone to make the clusters too red,\nrather than too blue. A number of other systematic effects could come into play:\n1. One possibility is that our method of using the average \u03b1-element abundances to compute\n[M/H] is too simplistic, although the [M/H] values would have to change drastically to make\nthe data points compatible with the models.\n2. Another possibility is that the clusters are much younger than expected and should therefore\nbe compared to younger models. We think this is unlikely: deriving ages from mid-IR model\npredictions and colors alone (clearly a risky idea given the limited age sensitivity shown in\nFigure 3) would suggest ages younger than 2 Gyr. Such young ages would have a substantial\neffect on optical and near-infrared colors, and there are no suggestions from recent spectroscopic or SED-fitting studies of M31 clusters (e.g. Rey et al. 2007; Caldwell et al. 2009;\nWang et al. 2010) that the brightest clusters are all so young.\n3. Reddening corrections could play a role: the metal-rich clusters have a higher average reddening than the metal-poor clusters, so if the E(B \u2212 V ) estimates of Caldwell et al. (2011)\nwere too high, the corrected colors of metal-rich clusters would be more strongly affected. As\nan example, we found that reducing the reddening values of all clusters by 20% brought the\ndata points and models into better agreement over the entire metallicity range.4\n4\n\nThe reddening law itself is unlikely to be the problem, since almost all of the correction to the V \u2212infrared colors\nis in AV and there is no strong evidence that M31 has a different value of RV .\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\n4. All three model families could have some common flaw in the spectral libraries that causes\nthem to predict too much infrared flux, or too little V -band. Some SSP models are known\nto have problems reproducing globular cluster colors in the infrared (Conroy & Gunn 2010,\nFigure 6), so a problem with the less-well-calibrated IRAC bands seems plausible.\n5. Finally, the results of Strader et al. (2009) on the mass-to-light ratios for M31 clusters suggest\nan interesting alternative. Those authors found M/L to be lower for metal-rich M31 clusters\nthan for metal-poor clusters, contrary to predictions from SSP models. While younger populations are expected to have lower M/L, Strader et al. argued against the metal-rich M31\nclusters being even intermediate-age, and concluded that variations in the cluster mass function, either initially or through dynamical evolution, were more likely explanations. A flatter\nmass function, required to match the mass-to-light ratios, should qualitatively also result in\nbluer predicted colors: fewer low-mass stars would mean less V -band light (dominated by\nthe main sequence), and more high-mass stars should mean more infrared light (dominated\nby giants). The different initial mass functions available in the SSP models do not result in\nlarge differences in predicted colors, but perhaps more drastic alterations to the mass function\nwould change colors more dramatically.\nWe consider the last three of these options to be more plausible explanations of the offset. Distinguishing between them requires better-quality data than are currently available.\nIf we assume that the model-data offset in V \u2212infrared colors is due to a systematic problem\nin the models, we can still use our data to explore the metallicity sensitivity of these colors. We\nperformed least-squares fits of color as a function of metallicity, weighted by the color uncertainty.\nFor the clusters binned in metallicity, we found slopes in the range 0.42\u20130.46 for all three colors,\nvery close to the value of 0.409 derived by Cohen et al. (2007) for V \u2212 Ks in Milky Way globular\nclusters. For the full, unbinned M31 sample we derive a slope of 0.39 for V \u2212 Ks . For this sample\nwe derive somewhat steeper slopes of 0.68 for V \u2212 [3.6] and 0.59 for V \u2212 [4.5], still shallower than\nthe slope of 0.90 derived by Spitler et al. (2008), although those authors were fitting the reverse\nfunction (metallicity as a function of color). The steeper slopes for the unbinned data agree better\nwith the general trend of the models. Of course, there is no guarantee that a linear fit is the correct\nrepresentation of the actual physical situation (and see Yoon et al. 2006), but the scatter visible in\nFigure 7 indicates that a more complicated fit is not likely to be meaningful.\nThe slopes of the linear fits indicate that V \u2212IRAC colors could be a useful metallicity indicator\nfor simple stellar populations. The low infrared background seen by Spitzer means that IRAC\nobservations to comparable depth can be made much more quickly than ground-based near-infrared\nobservations; however compared to V \u2212 Ks , V \u2212 IRAC colors have the disadvantage of being\nsomewhat more sensitive to reddening uncertainties and having (typically) poorer spatial resolution.\nEchoing Spitler et al. (2008), we caution that these colors are not well-calibrated for super-solar\nor very low ([M/H] . \u22121.9) metallicities. Using the M31 clusters to calibrate the relation would\nrequire careful matching of apertures in photometric bands differing by almost a factor of 10 in\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nwavelength (see Cohen et al. 2007, for a description of the difficulties involved in matching just\nbetween visible and near-infrared) and is not a trivial task even for these bright clusters. Using\nmore distant, unresolved clusters to calibrate the visible-to-IRAC color/metallicity relation might\nbe a better approach.\n\n4.\n\nSummary\n\nWe have presented mid-infrared photometry of massive globular clusters in M31, in order to\ntest the color predictions of population synthesis models. To our knowledge, this is the first such\ntest of the models in all four IRAC bands. The three different model families discussed here differ\nsomewhat in their predicted colors and in the systematic effects of age and metallicity. As might be\nexpected, models including circumstellar dust emission predict redder colors, particularly at longer\nwavelengths, and more color variability with age, particularly for ages . 8 Gyr. Except for the\n[5.8] \u2212 [8.0] color, the exact choice of circumstellar dust prescription does not make a substantial\ndifference. The present level of observational precision does not permit distinguishing between\nmodels; the considerable observational uncertainties, especially at the longer wavelengths, are due\nto the bright background from the galaxy and the falling cluster spectral energy distribution.\nWithin these uncertainties, the data and models are mostly in agreement. We find a small but not\nstatistically significant offset between models and data in the [4.5] \u2212 [5.8] color; if real, this could\nbe an indication of emission from circumstellar dust in some clusters. Finally, we find that visibleto-IRAC colors are bluer than model predictions, for reasons which are unclear. These colors could\nstill be feasible metallicity indicators for simple stellar populations but further work is required to\nestablish accurate calibrations.\nFacilities: Spitzer (IRAC), FLWO:2MASS ()\nWe thank the anonymous referee for helpful suggestions.
