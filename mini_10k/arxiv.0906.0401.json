These developments culminated\nin the gauge/string duality primarily in supersymmetric\ncases [1]. Meanwhile, in non-supersymmetric cases one of\nthe most remarkable progress is the open string tachyon\ncondensation [2]. However, these two developments have\nbeen rather orthogonal to each other, except for twodimensional string theories [3]. In this note we study an\nopen string tachyon condensation in the gauge/string duality and provide an example in which these two connect\nat the quantitative level [14].\nIn formulating tachyon condensations in the\ngauge/string duality, one immediate obstacle is that the\nmass squared of open string tachyons is of order O(1/\u03b1\u2032 )\nwhich may not be visible in the field theory limit \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0.\nHowever, there exist systems in which the open string\ntachyon mass remains of order O(1) (in an appropriate\nunit) in the limit \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0. One such example is a system\nof intersecting branes at angles. The mass squared of\nopen string tachyons stretched between intersecting\nbranes is proportional to \u03b8/\u03b1\u2032 where \u03b8 is an angle. In\nthis case we can take the \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 limit, keeping \u03b8/\u03b1\u2032\nfixed finite. This type of open string tachyons manifest\nthemselves as unstable modes in the gauge theory in the\nlow energy \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 limit of intersecting D-branes [5]. In\nthe present paper we consider a T-dual version of the\nsystem studied in [5] in the 't Hooft limit, N \u2192 \u221e and\ngY M \u2192 0 with \u03bb = gY2 M N fixed finite.\nOne of the most important aspects of open string\ntachyon condensation is that unstable D-branes which\nsupport open string tachyons disappear after the\ntachyons are condensed. Accordingly, Sen's conjecture\n\nstates that the height of the tachyon potential equals the\ntension (energy density) of unstable D-branes [2]. Hence\nthe height of the tachyon potential is one of the most important and unambiguous quantities in the open string\ntachyon condensation. The main objective of this paper\nis to compute the height of the tachyon potential both\nin the gauge theory and the dual AdS gravity for a large\nN D3-brane configuration and to see if they agree. We\nindeed find an exact agreement in the large N limit, thus\nproviding a simple example of gravitational duals of open\nstring tachyon condensation.\n\nII.\n\nBRANE CONFIGURATION\n\nWe consider a brane configuration of a D3-D1 bound\nstate parallel to coincident N D3-branes at some distance. The low energy description of this system is given\nby N = 4 U (N + 1) super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory.\nA D1-brane on D3-branes is represented by a magnetic\nflux. Our brane configuration is thus described by the\nfollowing gauge and adjoint scalar fields\nF23 = diag(B, 0, 0, * * * ) ,\n\u03a6 = diag(\u03c6, 0, 0, * * * ) ,\n\nwhere the magnetic flux B is T-dual to the aforementioned angle \u03b8, and B and \u03c6 are the constant parameters.\nThis is a classical solution of the SYM theory. It should\nbe clear that the D3-D1 bound state is separated from\nthe N D3-branes by the distance 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 \u03c6.\nWhen \u221athe D3-D1 bound state is close to the N D3branes ( \u03b1\u2032 \u03c6 \u226a 1), there appear tachyonic fluctuation\nmodes in the off-diagonal entries of the gauge and scalar\nfields. This is a manifestation of string excitations connecting the D3-D1 bound state and the N D3-branes [5]\n(see also [6] for its relevance to D-brane reconnections).\nMore precisely, the lowest excitation of these strings has\nthe mass squared\n\n\u2217 G.W.Gibbons(at)damtp.cam.ac.uk\n\u2020 koji(at)riken.jp\n\u2021 hirano(at)nbi.dk\n\n(1)\n\n2\n\nm2 = (2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 \u03c6T ) \u2212\n\narctan(2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 |B|)\n,\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\n\n(2)\n\n\f2\nwhere T = 1/2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 is the string tension. For small |B| \u226a\n1/\u03b1\u2032 , this yields\nm2 = \u03c62 \u2212 |B|.\n(3)\n\u221a\nThus a tachyon develops for \u03c6 < B. We would like to\nstress that this tachyon has survived in the field theory\nlimit \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0. Hence it is visible in the gauge/string duality where the low energy \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 limit of N D3-branes\nis dual to the string theory on AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 . Note that\nwhen B = 0, this configuration is a point in the Coulomb\nbranch of N = 4 SYM. When B 6= 0, the Coulomb\nbranch is lifted and the configuration is no longer supersymmetric.\nIII.\n\nTHE POTENTIAL HEIGHT AT WEAK\nCOUPLING \u2013 FIELD THEORY\n\nWe now compute the height of the tachyon potential\nbased on the Sen's conjecture. At weak coupling \u03bb =\ngY2 M N \u226a 1 we can use the classical YM theory to evaluate the potential height. The top of the tachyon potential corresponds to the \u03c6 \u2192 \u221e limit at which the D3-D1\nbound state and the N D3-branes are infinitely separated\nand do not feel an attractive force (in terms of N = 4\nSYM theory, the one-loop potential vanishes for \u03c6 \u2192 \u221e).\nThe total energy density is given by\nE\n\n=\n\u03c6=\u221e\n\nN B2\n.\n2\u03bb\n\n(4)\n\n\u221a\nWhen \u03c6 < B, the tachyon develops. The endpoint\nof the tachyon condensation is a bound state of N + 1\nD3-branes and D1-branes (this is a T-dual of D-brane\nreconnections in [6]). Initially the D1-branes are bound\nto a single D3-brane isolated from the N coincident D3branes. The D3-D1 bound state is attracted to the N D3branes (\u03c6 decreases) and they coalesce (\u03c6 = 0). In this\nprocess the D1-branes distribute themselves uniformly\namong N + 1 coincident D3-branes. The total D1-brane\ncharge trF23 is conserved in the process. Thus the D1brane charge per each D3-brane is B/(N + 1);\n\u0010\n\u0011\nF23 = diag NB+1 , NB+1 , * * * , NB+1 ,\n(5)\n\u03a6 = diag(0, 0, * * * , 0) .\nHence the energy density of the final state is\nN +1\nE \u03c6=0 = 2\n2gY M\n\n\u0012\n\nB\nN +1\n\n\u00132\n\n=\n\nN B2 1\n.\n2\u03bb N + 1\n\n(6)\n\nAt large N , the difference of the energy yields\nE\n\n\u03c6=\u221e\n\nN B2\n\u2212E \u03c6=0 =\n+ O(1) .\n2\u03bb\n\nthe AdS string is 1/N , the N dependence is as expected\nfor the D-brane tension.\nNote also that we could have computed the potential\nheight without introducing \u03c6. However, the role of \u03c6\nis to dial the instability of our unstable brane system\nand catalyse the process of tachyon condensation. In the\ndual gravity description, as usual, the energy scale \u03c6 is\nmapped to the radial distance.\nIV.\n\nTHE POTENTIAL HEIGHT AT STRONG\nCOUPLING \u2013 GRAVITY DUAL\n\nWe next compute the potential height at strong coupling\n\u03bb = gY2 M N = 2\u03c0gs N \u226b 1. The low energy limit of N\nD3-branes is dual to the string theory on AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 . So\nin the dual description at \u03bb \u226b 1 we treat the D3-D1\nbound state as a probe D3-brane with a magnetic flux\nput in the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 geometry.\nThe low energy effective action of a probe D3-brane in\nthe AdS5 \u00d7S5 geometry is given by the Dirac-Born-Infeld\naction plus the Chern-Simons term (Ramond-Ramond 4form coupling) with the ansatz, r = r(t, x). The AdS5\nmetric is\nds2 =\n\nThis is the height of the tachyon potential at weak coupling. Note that since the effective coupling constant of\n\n(8)\n\nwhere the radius R = (4\u03c0gs (\u03b1\u2032 )2 N )1/4 and r = 0 is the\nhorizon. The resultant action is\nZ\ni\nhp\n\u2212 det H\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 1 ,\n(9)\nS = \u2212TD3 d4 x f \u22121\n\nwhere\n\nH\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03b7\u03b1\u03b2 + f \u2202\u03b1 r\u2202\u03b2 r + 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\n4\n\nf =\n\nR\n.\nr4\n\np\nf F\u03b1\u03b2 ,\n\n(10)\n(11)\n\nIn the decoupling limit the coordinate U \u2261 r/\u03b1\u2032 is fixed\nfinite, while \u03b1\u2032 is taken to zero. We consider the constant\nU and the magnetic field F23 = B. In these variables the\naction takes the form\n\"r\n#\nZ\n4\n\u22121\n2(2\u03c0)2 \u03bbB 2\n4 U\nS=\n\u2212 1 . (12)\nd x\n1+\n(2\u03c0)3 gs\n2\u03bb\nU4\nAs expected, this shows that the D3-D1 bound state falls\ninto the AdS horizon. As mentioned above, the energy\nscale \u03c6 in the gauge theory corresponds to the radial coordinate U in the gravity. So we can read off the potential\nenergy from this expression. In the large U (thus large\n\u03c6) limit, the energy density yields\nE\n\n(7)\n\nr2\nR2 2\n2\n2\n(\u2212dt\n+\ndx\n)\n+\ndr ,\nR2\nr2\n\nU\u226b1\n\n=\n\n\u0003\n1 \u0002 2\nB + O(1/U 4 ) .\n4\u03c0gs\n\nIn the small U (thus small \u03c6) limit, it yields\n\u0015\n\u0014\n|B| 2\n1\n4\n\u221a\nU + O(U ) .\n2\u03c0\nE U\u226a1 =\n(2\u03c0)3 gs\n2\u03bb\n\n(13)\n\n(14)\n\n\f3\nTherefore, the height of the potential is given by\nE\n\nU=\u221e\n\n\u2212E\n\n=\nU=0\n\nN B2\nB2\n=\n.\n4\u03c0gs\n2\u03bb\n\n(15)\n\nWe thus find an exact agreement with the weak coupling\nfield theory result (7) in the large N limit. Note, however,\nthat the value of the potential at the bottom differs \u2013\nB 2 /2\u03bb in the field theory and zero in the gravity.\nAs we have just seen, the AdS description of the (lifted)\nCoulomb branch of N = 4 SYM encodes the height of the\ntachyon potential. However, the open string tachyon is\nonly a valid picture in the weak coupling field theory, as\nit appears as a small fluctuation mode of the gauge and\nscalar fields. So in the strong coupling one cannot directly observe the open string tachyon. In other words,\nthe gauge/gravity duality is an open string (loops)/closed\nstring (tree) channel duality. Hence in the gravity description the open string tachyon is integrated out and\ncannot be directly observed [15]. However, there is no\ncontradiction in the agreement we found. The height of\nthe tachyon potential is the energy of an unstable brane\nand conserved at any gauge couplings. So the potential\nheight is an observable in the gravity description.\nIt is, however, noteworthy that the value of the potential height in the large N limit is not renormalized,\nremaining the same value from weak to strong coupling\n[16]. This calls for an explanation. The reason may\nbe that the magnetic flux B on the D3-brane is small\nB \u226a 1/\u03b1\u2032 in the D-brane set-up prior to the decoupling\n(field theory) limit. Hence our system of a D3-D1 bound\nstate parallel to N D3-branes at some distance is close to\na supersymmetric configuration. It is often the case that\nnot only BPS states but also near-BPS states are protected against stringy \u03b1\u2032 corrections [10]. In the decou\u221a\npling limit the effective \u03b1\u2032ef f of the AdS string is 1/ \u03bb.\nWe thus believe that this is the reason why we find an exact agreement between the gauge theory and the gravity\nresults in the large N limit.\nV.\n\nSUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS\n\nIn this note we provide an example of open string tachyon\ncondensations in the gauge/string duality. The idea is\nto consider a brane configuration in which open string\ntachyons survive in the field theory \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 limit. One\ncan explore various similar brane set-ups by generalising\nthe example we presented. However, we find it more\nilluminating only to discuss a single simple example.\nWe would like to give a brief discussion on topological\ndefects in the tachyon condensation and make a comparison between our study and the geometric tachyon\nobserved by Kutasov [11].\n\n[1] J. M. Maldacena, \"The large N limit of superconformal\nfield theories and supergravity,\" Adv. Theor. Math. Phys.\n\nFirst we discuss topological defects in the tachyon condensation [2]. In the present set-up the topological defect\nis a D(-1)-brane. The reason is as follows: Our brane\nconfiguration consists of a D3-D1 bound state and N\nD3-branes. The tachyonic modes come from 1-3 and 3-1\nstrings stretched between the D1-brane dissolved in the\nD3-D1 bound state and the N D3-branes. So the tachyon\nin question is a complex tachyon. When the complex\ntachyon condenses, the topological defect is co-dimension\n2 relative to the parent unstable brane. In N = 4 SYM\nthe tachyonic modes about the background (1) are the\nground state of the Landau level and localized in the\n(x2 , x3 )-plane orthogonal to the magnetic flux B. Hence,\nthe parent unstable brane is effectively a D1-brane extended along the (x0 , x1 )-directions. We thus expect a\nD(-1)-brane descended from the tachyon condensation as\na vortex on the D1-brane. In the weak coupling it is possible to analyse the vortex solution. However, it seems\nrather difficult to study the nucleation of this topological defect in the gravity dual, since we cannot directly\nsee the tachyon. In general it would be challenging but\nvery interesting to study the nucleation of topological defects in the gravity dual and compare them with the field\ntheory counterparts.\nFinally we make a brief comment on the geometric\ntachyon. Kutasov made an intriguing observation in [11]\nthat the Dp-brane effective action in the k = 2 NS5branes throat on a transverse circle coincides with the effective action of the non-BPS D(p+1)-brane [12] wrapped\non the circle in the zero radius limit. The transverse circle\nscalar on the Dp-brane is identified with the tachyon on\nthe non-BPS D(p + 1)-brane. It was further argued that\nthe two descriptions become identical via a second order\nphase transition [13]. In comparison, in our case the geometric (radion) instability in the AdS space is related\nto the open string tachyon via the gauge/string duality.\nHowever, it is not possible to map directly between a geometric (radion) mode on one side and a tachyonic mode\non the other, as discussed above. Hence the geometric\nmanifestation of tachyon condensation in our study is\nrather different from the geometric tachyon and they are\nnot related to each other in any obvious ways.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nK.H. would like to thank DAMTP, University of Cambridge, for a kind hospitality.
