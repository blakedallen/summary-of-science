In general, there is a non-zero critical interaction\nstrength required for this \"Mott transition\", so that two\nuncoupled bands with different degrees of correlation can\ncoexist in metallic and insulating states. The behavior\nof spectral functions and magnetic and superconducting\ncorrelations, when interband hopping or interactions are\nturned on, is a challenging theoretical problem. The coupling could immediately force both bands to be in the\nsame (metallic or insulating) phase, or coexistence might\npersist up to some critical degree of coupling [1, 2].\nClosely related questions arise as clean interfaces between correlated materials become accessible [3]. Here\nthe role of different orbitals is played by the multiple\nlayers. It has been suggested that it might be possible to\n\"engineer\" specific forms of spectral functions at the interface by varying the materials partnered, as well as design other properties arising from electronic interactions\n[4\u20136]. Experimental realizations include tunable 2D electron gases in oxide (SrTiO3 /LaAlO3 ) heterostructures,\ncontrol of magnetoresistance at manganite interfaces [7],\nnovel magnetic properties at boundaries between cuprate\nsuperconductors [8], and observation of magnetic proximity effect in Cu/CuO interfaces [9].\nWhile the detailed chemistry of both multi-orbital and\nlayered materials is complex, an interesting starting point\nfor studying the qualitative properties of metal-insulator\ninterfaces is provided by the multi-layer Hubbard Hamiltonian. In this model, electrons have both intralayer and\ninterlayer hopping, as well as layer-dependent contact interactions. The parameter space is large and in this paper\nwe focus on the simplest realization of the physics of a\nmetal-insulator interface in which all hybridizations are\nchosen to be equal except the one at the interface; the\n\ncorresponding Hamiltonian is\nX\nX \u2020\n(cil\u03c3 cjl\u03c3 + h.c.) \u2212 \u03bc\nnil\u03c3\n\u0124 = \u2212t\nhiji,l,\u03c3\n\n+\n\nX\ni,l\n\n\u2212\n\nX\n\n(1)\n\ni,l,\u03c3\n\nUl (nil\u2191 \u2212 1/2)(nil\u2193 \u2212 1/2)\ntll\u2032 (c\u2020il\u03c3 cil\u2032 \u03c3 + h.c.).\n\ni,hll\u2032 i,\u03c3\n\nHere c\u2020i l \u03c3 (ci l \u03c3 ) are creation (destruction) operators for\nfermions of spin \u03c3 at site i in layer l. Each layer is\nan N -site square lattice with a contact interaction Ul\nchosen to be non zero, Ul = U , on \"correlated\" layers\nl = 1, 2, 3, * * *, and zero for an additional set of \"metallic\" layers (l = \u22121, \u22122, \u22123, * * *). Layers are arranged in\norder of increasing l so that l = \u00b11 label the layers at the\ninterface. t and tll\u2032 are the intra and interlayer nearestneighbor hybridizations. tll\u2032 = t except at the interface\nwhere it takes the value t\u22121,1 = V . We consider the case\nwhere \u03bc = 0 which, as a consequence of particle-hole symmetry, makes all layers half-filled, hnil\u03c3 i = 0.5. Recent\nstudies on similar models have found induced magnetic\norder in the metal [10] and quasi-particle penetration in\nparamagnetic Mott insulators [11].\nQuestions that arise in connection with Hamiltonian\n(1) can be seen as extensions to those typically asked in\nthe context of heavy-Fermion materials [12] and concern,\nat least at half-filling, the competition of magnetic order\nand screening of local moments by conduction electrons.\nHeavy-Fermion materials are modeled by Hamiltonian\n(1), a bilayer with l = \u00b11, or by its strong coupling limit,\nthe Kondo-Heisenberg lattice, where charge fluctuations\non the correlated layers are neglected. The fundamental\nissue we address here is how this competition is affected\nas the two-layer case crosses over to the 3-dimensional\n\n\f2\n\nwhere \u03c3ilx = c\u2020il\u2191 cil\u2193 + c\u2020il\u2193 cil\u2191 and \u03c3ilz = c\u2020il\u2191 cil\u2191 \u2212 c\u2020il\u2193 cil\u2193 ,\nand the local layer dependent spectral function Al (\u03c9),\nobtained by inverting the integral equation\nZ +\u221e\ne\u2212\u03c9\u03c4\nGl (\u03c4 ) =\nd\u03c9\nAl (\u03c9)\n(3)\n1 + e\u2212\u03b2\u03c9\n\u2212\u221e\nvia the maximum entropy method [14].\nGl (\u03c4 ) =\nP\n\u2020\nhT\nc\n(\u03c4\n)\nc\n(0)\ni\nis\nthe\nquantity\ndirectly\nobtainable\nil\u03c3\ni\u03c3\nil\u03c3\nby DQMC, and is averaged over 4 boundary conditions\ncorresponding to setting the hopping at the boundary of\neach layer to \u00b1t [15].

At small V the system is made up of\nmagnetically ordered layers weakly coupled to a metal.\nAt large V the central bilayer decouples and leaves the\nexternal layers either metallic (l \u2264 \u22122) or insulating,\nwith anti-ferromagnetic long range order (l \u2265 +2).\nOur results indicate that, for a four-layer system, two\ninteracting and two metallic sheets, and at intermediate interfacial hybridization, there exists an intervening\nphase where loss of anti-ferromagnetic order is seen in\nboth correlated layers, +1 and +2, despite the fact that\nthe latter is not in direct contact with the metal. We\nfound that the electronic structure of the metal is also\nprofoundly affected and that the overall phase of the\nquad-layer can be characterized as a Kondo insulator.\nThis is in contrast to our other finding when the interaction region becomes thicker than the metallic one: no\nloss of magnetic order is found in layers beyond the one\nimmediately adjacent to the metal, regardless of the hybridization strength V . In this case, upon increasing V ,\na direct transition between the small and large V regimes\nresults.\nWe addressed the physics of Hamiltonian (1) using determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) [13], an exact, finite-T method for solving tight binding Hamiltonians on finite lattices. As we limit our calculations to\nthe perfectly half-filled case, there is no sign problem at\nany temperature. Our results are averaged over several\nindependent simulations, and the error bars correspond\nto the standard deviation of the mean. The imaginarytime step is set to \u2206\u03c4 = t/8.

(b) Finite size scaling\nof in-plane structure factor S2af of the correlated layer (l =\n2) farthest from the interface. For small V , there is long\nrange order in the thermodynamic limit which vanishes for\nintermediate V and is recovered for large V . S2af reaches its\nground state value at \u03b2t = 10.\n\nTo gain initial quantitative understanding of the evolution of magnetic properties as V increases, we show,\nin the top panel of Fig. 1, the evolution of local moments in a system of two metallic and two interacting\nsheets. There are three regimes, most clearly evidenced\nby the behavior of the metallic layer at the interface. At\nV <\n\u223c t local moments on layer \u22121 are essentially identi<\ncal to those of a non-interacting system. In t <\n\u223c V \u223c 4t\nthe moments monotonically increase and they saturate\nat V \u2243 4t. The evolution of the other layers follows naturally, with layer +1 merging with \u22121 at large V in a\nphase that can be best characterized as a band insulator made of weakly interacting dimers. Layer +2 has the\nonly non-monotonic evolution: magnetism is first suppressed and then revived as the central dimer phase gets\nincreasingly stabilized.\nWe then use finite size scaling on S2af to investigate\nwhether order in layer +2 is lost in the regime where\nthe moments are most suppressed. As shown in the\nlower panel of Fig. 1, S2af scales to a nonzero value for\nboth small and large interface hopping, V\u221a\n, when plotted\nagainst the inverse linear system size 1/ N .

(b) In correlated layer l = 1, A1 (\u03c9) resembles A2 (\u03c9) but\nunlike l = 2 the large V behavior is a broader gap associated\nwith the singlet energy scale. In both non-interacting layers\nA\u22121 (\u03c9) (c) and A\u22122 (\u03c9) (d) a gap opens as V increases. At\nlarge V , layer \u22122 recovers metallic properties while the singlet\ngap is visible in layer \u22121.\n\nthe behavior of the local moments. However, in the intermediate regime (starting at V \u2265 t, in rough correspondence to where loss of anti-ferromagnetic order happens\nin the periodic Anderson model [18] and the bilayer Hubbard model [19]) loss of magnetic order is clearly observed\non layer +2 as well.\nThe most likely candidate mechanism for such loss of\norder involves Kondo screening in both interacting layers. As the formation of a resonance in the single particle\nspectral density is one of the hallmark of such process,\nwe plot, in Fig.2, the layer dependent spectral density\nat T = t/30. We found that, at V = 2t, both interacting layers are characterized by the presence of a Kondo\nresonance. Due to the fact that we are focusing on a halffilled system, the resonance is split as typically happens\nfor Kondo insulators.\nWe can gain further insight into the nature of this intermediate phase by looking at the behavior of the noninteracting layers. Figure 3 shows the conductivity in\nlayers l = \u22121 and l = \u22122. At small hybridization, before\nthe loss of magnetic order, the conductivity increases as\nT is lowered, showing these two sheets to be metallic.\n<\nIn the intermediate regime t <\n\u223c V \u223c 3t, the conductivity is strongly suppressed in both layers, and our inverse\ntemperature results suggest that these layers become insulating around V = t in correspondence with the loss of\nmagnetic order.\nFrom these results we can draw a few significant conclusions. First, that there is a Kondo proximity effect,\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nV/t\nFIG. 3: (color online) (a) In-plane conductivity \u03c3\u22121 in the\nmetallic layer l = \u22121 as a function of V , at several inverse\ntemperature \u03b2 values.

This noninteracting layer becomes\ninsulating for intermediate hybridization, t \u2264 V <\n\u223c 3t and\nthen recovers when the pairs are fully formed and pinned at\nthe interface.\n\nas already observed using dynamical mean-field theory\non a similar model [11]. The novelty of our finding resides in our treatment of non-local correlation. It allows\nfor a proper description of the competition between magnetic order and Kondo screening and shows the latter to\nbe effective in destroying order even on layers not directly coupled to the metal. Furthermore, states from\nboth metallic layers participate in the screening of local\nmoments as best evidenced by the drop in conductivity.\nThis situation is reminiscent of a long-range resonating\nvalence-bond state although it is unclear whether such a\ndescription remains meaningful in the present context of\nitinerant electrons.\nThe other kind of proximity effect that is expected in\nsuch systems is due to the presence of the magnetically\nordered layers at smaller values of V . This would seem\na likely scenario, especially since the metallic phase lives\non layers with nested Fermi surfaces with infinite, T = 0,\nanti-ferromagnetic susceptibility. Our calculations, however, do not find any significant penetration of magnetic\norder in the metallic layers. Although we cannot exclude\nthat an extremely small order parameter might develop\nat low T for some range of V , our finding suggests that\nsuch an order would not survive the generic scenario of a\nsystem with finite susceptibility. This result appears at\nodds with recent experiments [9] finding evidence for an\nanti-ferromagnetic proximity effect.\nWe now consider the question of how the competition\nof Kondo screening and magnetic order is affected when\nadditional interacting layers l = 3, 4, * * * are present.

At intermediate V antiferromagnetic\norder is suppressed in every correlated layer. At large V the\norder recovers in every correlated layer but the one at the\ninterface. (b) Finite-size scaling of the in-plane structure factors Slaf for a system of six correlated layers coupled to two\nmetallic ones, at V = 2t. A systematic reduction of spin correlations is evident as the metallic interface is approached from\nthe correlated side. Long range magnetic order is completely\ndestroyed in the correlated layer at the junction.\n\nresulting system can be thought of describing the interface between a thin metallic film and a bulk antiferromagnetic Mott insulator or as a heterostructure\nwhere the insulating domains are substantially thicker\nthan the metallic ones. A scan of Slaf for different values\nof V on a 6-layer cluster with 600 sites (top panel in Fig.\n4) indicates that the most likely parameter regime to observe loss of magnetic order in layer 2 is for V /t \u2208 [1, 2].\nHowever, for V = 2t (lower panel of Fig. 4), we found\nthat, while S1af does not extrapolate to a non-zero value,\nthe same does not happen for layers located deeper into\nthe interacting material i.e. l = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are all antiferromagnetically ordered. This revival of magnetic longrange order on layer +2 can be interpreted as a magnetic\nproximity effect exerted by a bulk anti-ferromagnet on\nthose correlated layers subject to Kondo screening. Note\nthat a clear suppression of the order parameter is still\nobserved for l = 2 and several layers deeper in indicating coexistence of Kondo screening and magnetism (the\nanomalously large value at l = 6 is a known phenomenon\nwhere surface magnetic correlations are larger than the\nbulk and has been widely explored experimentally [20]).\nIn conclusion, we have presented results on a model of\nmetal-insulator interface, the multilayer Hubbard Hamiltonian. Even within this simplified tight-binding model,\nthere are many possible choices of the intralayer and interlayer hoppings. The dominant feature of the coupling\n\nof the metal and strongly interacting material is a suppression of magnetic order on the correlated side. We\ndid not observe the converse phenomenon, namely a significant penetration of magnetism into the metal, as has\nbeen noted in [10]. It is possible this difference arises from\nthe lower value of the on-site interaction, U/t = 4, used\nhere, compared to U/t \u2248 17 in [10]. Such large couplings\nare difficult to treat in DQMC. The on-site interactions\nstudied here are relevant to the range of fitted values for\na number of interesting materials, e.g. CuO [21].\nWe showed that for thin insulating layers the Kondo\neffect embraces correlated and metallic layers that are\nnot in direct contact with each other. Although such an\nextended Kondo insulating phase does not require any\nfine tuning, it is not a phase that permeates a large fraction of the \"phase space\" for such systems. Here we have\nshown, for instance, that forming Kondo singlets across\nmultiple layers is a process that can be defeated by magnetic proximity effect of layers farther from the interface.\nThis work was supported by: the CNRS-UC Davis\nEPOCAL LIA joint research grant; by NSF-PIF-1005503\nand DOE SSAAP DE-FG52-09NA29464; ARO Award\nW911NF0710576 with funds from the DARPA OLE Program; and Army Research Office Grant 56693-PH.\n\n[1] A.
