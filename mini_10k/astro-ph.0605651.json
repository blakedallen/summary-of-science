Oppenheimer1, Romeel Dav\u00e91\n1\nAstronomy Department, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721\n\n16 September 2017\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWe investigate models of self-consistent chemical enrichment of the intergalactic\nmedium (IGM) from z = 6.0 \u2192 1.5, based on hydrodynamic simulations of structure\nformation that explicitly incorporate outflows from star forming galaxies. Our main\nresult is that outflow parameterizations derived from observations of local starburst\ngalaxies, in particular momentum-driven wind scenarios, provide the best agreement\nwith observations of C iv absorption at z \u223c 2 \u2212 5. Such models sufficiently enrich the\nhigh-z IGM to produce a global mass density of C iv absorbers that is relatively invariant from z = 5.5 \u2192 1.5, in agreement with observations. This occurs despite continual\nIGM enrichment causing an increase in volume-averaged metallicity by \u223c \u00d75 \u2212 10 over\nthis redshift range, because energy input accompanying the enriching outflows causes\na drop in the global ionization fraction of C iv. Comparisons to observed C iv column\ndensity and linewidth distributions and C iv-based pixel optical depth ratios provide\nsignificant constraints on wind models. Our best-fitting outflow models show mean\nIGM temperatures only slightly above our no-outflow case, metal filling factors of just\na few percent with volume-weighted metallicities around 10\u22123 at z \u223c 3, significant\namounts of collisionally-ionized C iv absorption, and a metallicity-density relationship\nthat rises rapidly at low overdensities and flattens at higher ones. In general, we find\nthat outflow speeds must be high enough to enrich the low-density IGM at early times\nbut low enough not to overheat it, and concurrently must significantly suppress early\nstar formation while still producing enough early metals. It is therefore non-trivial\nthat locally-calibrated momentum-driven wind scenarios naturally yield the desired\nstrength and evolution of outflows, and suggest that such models represent a significant step towards understanding the impact of galactic outflows on galaxies and the\nIGM across cosmic time.\nKey words: intergalactic medium, galaxies: formation, galaxies: high-redshift, cosmology: theory, methods: numerical\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe intergalactic medium (IGM) contains the majority of\nthe Universe's baryons (Dav\u00e9 et al. 2001) and its largest\nstructures, yet paradoxically can typically only be painstakingly observed in absorption against a background source.\nThe marriage of high-resolution Echelle spectroscopy on 810m class telescopes with cosmological hydrodynamic simulations in the last decade has led to the understanding\nthat the Lyman-\u03b1 forest arises from highly-photoionized\nH i tracing fluctuations in the underlying IGM density\nin the so-called Fluctuating Gunn-Peterson Approximation\n(Croft et al. 1998). This ionization state of the absorbing gas\nis governed by a balance between photo-ionizational heating due to the metagalactic UV background and adiabatic\n\ncooling from Hubble expansion, yielding a tight densitytemperature relation known as the IGM equation of state\n(Hui & Gnedin 1997).\nA surprising discovery was that the diffuse IGM is enriched with metals, seen as C iv, Si iv, and O vi absorption\nlines in quasar spectra. Despite our understanding of H i absorption, the origin of these metals far from sites of star\nformation remains puzzling. Currently the leading candidate for enriching the IGM is supernova-driven outflows,\nbecause dynamical disruption of galaxies is too inefficient\n(Aguirre et al. 2001, see also Figure 10). Understanding such\ngalactic feedback processes is crucial for developing a complete theory of galaxy formation and evolution (Dekel & Silk\n1986), as observations such as the shallow faint-end slope of\nthe galaxy stellar mass function (Cole et al. 2001) versus the\n\n\f2\n\nB. D. Oppenheimer & R. Dav\u00e9\n\nhalo mass function (Jenkins et al. 2001), the galaxy massmetallicity relation (Tremonti et al. 2004; Erb et al. 2006),\nand the overproduction of stars in the Universe in models\nwithout feedback (Dav\u00e9 et al. 2001; Springel & Hernquist\n2003b) indicate that outflows significantly affect galaxy\nproperties.\nObservations of metal abundance in various ions that\ntrace different densities can quantify the metallicity-density\nrelation in the IGM (Dav\u00e9 et al. 1998), thereby constraining the nature of the enriching outflows. Early results from\nKeck's High Resolution Echelle Spectrograph (HIRES) constrained typical IGM metallicities as traced by C iv to be\n\u22123 .[C/H]. \u22122 (Songaila & Cowie 1996; Dav\u00e9 et al. 1998).\nSubsequent observations by Songaila (2001), Schaye et al.\n(2003) (hereafter S03), and Songaila (2005) further showed\nthat C iv absorption evolves very little from z \u223c 5 \u2192 2,\nwhich is surprising considering that the vast majority of\nstars in the Universe form at z < 5. These results have\nbeen interpreted as implying early enrichment by primeval\ngalaxies and/or Population III stars at z > 6, where physical distances are small and shallow potential wells allow\nwinds to distribute metals over large comoving volumes\n(Scannapieco et al. 2002). In contrast, Adelberger et al.\n(2003, 2005) observe enhanced C iv and O vi absorption in\nthe vicinity of galaxies at z \u223c 2 \u2212 3, suggesting that enrichment is ongoing at lower redshifts in the form of superwinds from Lyman-break galaxies (Pettini et al. 2001;\nShapley et al. 2003). Porciani & Madau (2005) counter this\nby showing that such strong correlations can arise from metals ejected from dwarf galaxies between z \u2248 6 \u2212 12, because outflows from highly biased early galaxies should lie\nin highly overdense regions at lower redshifts. Hence the\nsources and epoch of IGM enrichment remain controversial.\nRecent observations of local starbursts have provided\nnew insights into the nature and impact of supernovadriven winds. Observations of dwarf starbursts and luminous\ninfrared galaxies generally find outflows when detectable\n(Martin 2005; Rupke, Veilleux & Sanders 2005), observed\nas blueshifted Na i absorption arising from cold clumps entrained in hot metal-rich outflowing gas. While earlier data\nshowed little trend of outflow properties with host galaxy\nproperties (Martin 1999; Heckman et al. 2000), these more\nrecent data suggest that massive galaxies with higher star\nformation rates (SFR's) drive faster and more energetic\nwinds. It is of particular interest here that recent data\nexhibit trends that are broadly consistent with theoretical expectations for momentum-driven (or radiation-driven)\nwinds (Martin 2005; Murray, Quatert, & Thompson 2005),\nthereby providing for the first time some intuition on the\nphysical mechanisms that drive outflows. In such a model,\nradiation from young stars impinges on dust in the outflow,\nwhich then couples to the gas and propels matter out of the\ngalaxy (Murray, Quatert, & Thompson 2005). This is somewhat different than the canonical scenario where the overpressure from local ISM heating causes a bubble that eventually bursts out of the galaxy (Fujita et al. 2004, e.g.). An\nadvantage of momentum-driven winds is that, unlike heat,\nmomentum cannot be radiated away, and hence can plausibly drive winds over large distances.\nFor our purposes, such scenarios for outflows provide a\nphysically and observationally-motivated model connecting\nwind properties with host galaxy properties, which we can\n\nexploit in order to understand the global impact of outflows\non the IGM across cosmic time. Doing so requires modeling large-scale outflows within the context of hierarchical\nstructure formation. This is the main focus of this paper.\nIn this paper we explore the impact of various feedback\nmechanisms on IGM metallicity using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, based on an explicit implementation\nof superwind feedback pioneered by Springel & Hernquist\n(2003b) (hereafter SH03). Our simulations also include\nmetal-line cooling, which significantly affects the temperature structure of metal-enriched IGM (Aguirre et al. 2005).\nOur goal here is to construct an enrichment model that\ncan reproduce both the metal-line observations of the IGM\nas well as the star formation history of the universe. We\nfocus primarily on C iv absorption line observations between z = 1.5 \u2212 6.0 since this species is the cleanest\ntracer of IGM metallicity observable over this redshift range\n(Songaila & Cowie 1996; Hellsten et al. 1998).\nThis paper is organized as follows. \u00a72 discusses the simulations including the modifications we made to Gadget-2,\nthe various feedback models we run, and the generation of\nsimulated spectra. \u00a73 gives an overview of the global IGM\nphysical properties in our suite of outflow simulations, while\n\u00a74 discusses the physical characteristics of IGM metals and\nC iv absorbers. \u00a75 compares our findings to observations analyzed by Voigt profile fitting of lines and the Pixel Optical\nDepth (POD) method. In \u00a76 we show that our results are robust against the effects of numerical resolution. We present\nour conclusions in \u00a77.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nSIMULATIONS\nHydrodynamic Simulations of Structure\nFormation\n\nWe employ the N-body+hydrodynamic code Gadget2 (Springel 2005), which uses a tree-particle-mesh data\nstructure to efficiently compute gravitational forces on a\nsystem of particles, along with an entropy-conservative\nformulation of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH;\nSpringel & Hernquist 2002) to model the pressure forces and\nshocks in the gaseous component. The code is fully adaptive\nin space and time, enabling simulations with large dynamic\nrange crucial for studying galaxies together with large-scale\nstructure.\nAdditionally, Gadget-2 models a number of physical\nprocesses important for the formation of galaxies. Star formation is modeled using a subgrid recipe in which each\ngas particle above a critical density where fragmentation\nbecomes possible (calculated from the thermal Jeans mass\nbased on the local cooling rate) is treated as a set of\ncold clouds embedded in a warm ionized medium, similar to the interstellar medium of our own Galaxy. The\nprocesses of evaporation and condensation are followed\nanalytically within each particle using the formalism of\nMcKee & Ostriker (1977). Stars are allowed to form in the\ncold clouds at a rate proportional to its density squared.\nThis produces a disk surface density-star formation rate relationship that is in agreement with the relation observed\nby Kennicutt (1998), when a single free parameter, the star\nformation timescale, is set to 2 Gyr (Springel & Hernquist\n\n\fSimulations of IGM Enrichment\n2003a). Feedback energy from Type II supernovae is then\nadded to the hot phase of the ISM, using an instantaneous\nrecycling approximation. SH03 found that the multi-phase\nmodel produces self-regulated star formation that does not\nsuffer from runaway star formation with increasing resolution, as seen in previous simulations (Balogh et al. 2001;\nDav\u00e9 et al. 2001). However, the converged star formation\nrate was still found to be too high when compared with observations, motivating SH03 to include galactic outflows as\nwe describe in \u00a72.3.\nPhoto-ionization heating is incorporated based on\na spatially-uniform ultraviolet background taken from\nHaardt & Madau (2001), described in detail in \u00a72.6.\nGadget-2 also includes radiative cooling. In the simulations\nrun by SH03, the cooling rates were computed assuming primordial composition with 76% hydrogen by mass. In \u00a72.2 we\ndescribe improvements to the cooling module and extend it\nto include metal-line cooling.\nGadget-2 tracks the metallicity of gas and stellar particles. Gas particles that are eligible to form stars continually enrich themselves with metals based on an assumption\nof instantaneous recycling and using a yield of 0.02 (i.e. solar metallicity). This yield is roughly what one would expect using supernova yields from Woosley & Weaver (1995)\nin a Chabrier IMF. When a particle is converted into a star\n(which happens in two stages, such that each star particle\nhas half the mass of its original gas particle), then the star\nparticle inherits the metallicity of its parent gas particle at\nthe time of conversion.\n2.2\n\nRadiative Cooling With Metal Lines\n\nIn the simulations of SH03, cooling is done using an implicit scheme wherein the cooling timestep is the same as\nthe hydrodynamical timestep as set by the Courant condition (Springel & Hernquist 2002). While in most cases this\nis a stable and accurate method, in dense regions surrounding galaxies the cooling time can be considerably shorter\nthan the sound crossing time, but still not so rapid so\nthat the particle reaches thermal equilibrium within such\na time. Since the implicit method uses the cooling rate at\nthe end of the timestep to evolve the thermal energy over\nthe entire timestep, it can give inaccurate answers in regions\nwhere the slope of the cooling curve is varying rapidly. This\nhappens at moderately high densities, and at temperatures\n\u223c 104.5 \u2212 105.5 K (see Katz, Weinberg, Hernquist 1996, for\nsome examples of cooling curves).\nIn order to handle this regime better, we have modified\nGadget-2 to implement a scheme to follow cooling on the\ncooling timescale. As with Springel & Hernquist (2003a), we\nassume that the particle's density and non-radiative rate of\nchange of thermal energy remain fixed during the dynamical\ntimestep; these assumptions are of course not valid in detail,\nbut are made to facilitate ease of computation. We also continue to assume ionization equilibrium at all times, although\nthe algorithm we have implemented makes it easier to follow non-equilibrium evolution; non-equilibrium effects are\nnot expected to be important in the moderately overdense\nIGM that will be the focus of this paper.\nWe compute the cooling time as\nu\ntcool = \u01ebcool\n,\n(1)\ndu/dt\n\n3\n\nwhere u is the thermal energy, du/dt is the rate of change of\nthermal energy, and \u01ebcool is a tolerance factor that we set to\n0.002. This choice means that in a single cooling timestep\na particle cannot cool away more than 0.2% of its thermal\nenergy. We further limit the cooling timescale such that it\ncannot be less than 0.2% the dynamical timescale, so a particle can take up to 500 cooling timesteps for each dynamical\ntimestep. The value of this tolerance parameter was chosen\nbased on numerous tests on individual particles in the moderate overdensity, warm-hot temperature regime.\ndu/dt for a given particle is obtained from a lookup\ntable based on its density and temperature. The lookup table is computed for a given strength of the photo-ionizing\nbackground, redshift (for Compton cooling), and assuming primordial composition. The strength of the ionizing\nbackground is interpolated to the system redshift from the\nHaardt & Madau (2001) model, and when its strength has\nchanged by more than 1% the lookup tables are recomputed. The lookup tables are also recomputed whenever\n\u2206z > 1 since the last lookup table computation, which\nis important in the early universe when Compton cooling\noff microwave background photons is strong. The rate balance for primordial species are calculated as described in\nKatz, Weinberg, Hernquist (1996). If a particle is enriched,\nwe add cooling due to metal lines as described below.\nWe advance the particle's thermal energy explicitly\nbased on the cooling rate computed at the beginning of the\ncooling timestep, and then recompute the cooling rate based\non the new thermal energy. If the cooling rate has changed\nsign, then the particle has passed an equilibrium point, and\nwe return to the original state and reduce the timestep until\neither it no longer changes sign, or the timestep falls below the minimum value. If the cooling rate has not changed\nsign, we advance the thermal energy using the average of\nthe cooling rates calculated at the beginning and end of the\ncooling timestep, thereby preserving second order accuracy.\nWe continue to advance the particle until it has been evolved\nover its dynamical (or Courant) timestep.\nTo quantify the difference between the old implicit\nmethod and our new algorithm, consider particles with\nnH \u2248 10\u22123 (i.e. overdensity of 100 at z = 2.5) and T \u2248\n104.5 K. By running Gadget-2 with the old and new versions of cooling, we found that such a particle has a mean\nabsolute difference in the final temperature of 1.4% over a\nsingle hydrodynamical timestep. At T = 105 K it is 0.5%,\nand at higher temperatures it rapidly becomes irrelevant.\nThese values are small but non-trivial, and may accumulate\nover many timesteps. At higher densities the effects become\nmore significant: For nH = 10\u22122 and T = 105 K, the mean\ndifference is 8% (with values discrepant up to \u223c \u00d72) and it\nis highly systematic in the sense that the new method produces temperatures higher by about 7%. This depends on\nthe exact temperature, however, because whether the implicit method over or underestimates the temperature depends on the sign of the cooling curve slope at that temperature. Although the new method increases the total run time\nby typically 20-30%, it seems worthwhile in order to track\nthe thermal history of particles more accurately in the moderately shock-heated, moderately overdense regime, since as\nwe shall show (see Figure 9) a substantial amount of C iv\nabsorption arises here.\nAs Gadget-2 tracks gas-phase metallicities, it is pos-\n\n\f4\n\nB. D. Oppenheimer & R. Dav\u00e9\n\nsible to use this information directly to compute the additional contribution to cooling rates from metal line cooling.\nTo do so, we employ the collisional ionization equilibrium\nmodels of Sutherland & Dopita (1993) to generate a lookup\ntable of metal cooling versus temperature and metallicity,\nobtained by subtracting their zero-metallicity models from\ntheir metal-enriched cooling curves. If enriched, a gas particle then experiences additional cooling from its metals based\non a bilinear interpolation within the metal cooling table.\nWe also account for the impact of metal cooling on the\nmulti-phase subgrid ISM model, since the density at which\nthe fragmentation sets in and star formation begins depends\non the cooling rate.\n2.3\n\nSuperwind Feedback\n\nSH03 found that even with the resolution-converged multiphase ISM model for star formation, the global star formation rate predicted by simulations exceeded observations by\n\u223c \u00d73. Hence they additionally included an explicit model\nfor superwind feedback in order to reduce the reservoir of\ngas available for star formation. In Gadget-2, particles that\nare capable of star formation are given a probability of entering into a superwind based on their current star formation rate. If a particle enters a superwind, then it is kicked\nwith a velocity given by vwind , in a direction given by v \u00d7 a\n(which would yield a polar outflow in the case of a thin\ndisk). Furthermore, the wind particle is not allowed to interact hydrodynamically until it has escaped from the star\nforming region such that its SPH density is less than 10% of\nthe critical density for multi-phase collapse; SH03 find that\nthe results are not very sensitive to the choice of this value,\nso long as the winds escape the dense star forming region.\nThis is intended to mimic a free-flowing chimney of gas extending outside the star-forming region as observed in local\nstarbursts.\nIn the SH03 prescription there are two main free parameters: The wind speed vwind and the mass loading factor \u03b7,\nwhich is the rate of material being ejected from the galaxy\nrelative to its star formation rate. Following observations by\nMartin (1999) and Heckman et al. (2000) and IGM enrichment considerations from Aguirre et al. (2001), these values\nwere both taken to be constant in the runs done by SH03, at\nvalues of 484 km/s and 2, respectively. We will call this the\nconstant wind (cw) model. This model resulted in a z = 0\nstellar mass density in broad agreement with observations.\nThe constant wind prescription, while simple and effective, has some deficiencies. Although the nature of the winds\nfrom the smallest protogalaxies are currently unobtainable\nby observations, using the same large wind velocities for\nthese galaxies would heat the IGM too much by z = 3 to\nagree with C iv observations (Aguirre et al. 2005), though\nmetal-line cooling performed self-consistently may alter that\nconclusion. Additionally, we find that this model has poor\nresolution convergence in terms of global metal enrichment\u2013\na higher-resolution simulation that resolves small galaxies\nearlier will distribute a great deal more metals throughout\nthe IGM at early times as compared to a lower-resolution\nrun.\nObservations of outflows from starburst galaxies have\nimproved considerably in recent years. Martin (2005) found\nthat the terminal wind velocity scales roughly linearly with\n\ncircular velocity, with top winds speeds around three times\nthe galaxy's circular velocity. Rupke, Veilleux & Sanders\n(2005) studied a large sample of luminous infrared galaxies\nto find that, at least when combined with smaller systems\nfrom Martin (2005), those trends continue to quite large\nsystems. It is worth noting that these observations generally target cold clouds entrained in the hot wind as traced\nby Na i absorption, not the hot wind itself that carries most\nof metals. Still, Heckman (2003) argues that the wind speeds\nand mass loading factors are likely to be more accurately inferred from this cold component owing to the observational\ndifficulty of detecting X-ray emission from hot gas.\nA feasible physical scenario for the wind driving mechanism is deduced by noting that the observed scaling are well explained by a momentum-driven\nwind model (Martin 2005), such as that outlined in\nMurray, Quatert, & Thompson (2005). In such a scenario,\nit is the radiation pressure of the starburst that drives\nthe outflow, possibly by transferring momentum to an\nabsorptive component (such as dust) that then couples\nto the bulk outflowing material. The presence of large\namounts of dust surrounding the classic starburst galaxy\nM82 (Engelbracht et al. 2006) lends circumstantial support\nto this type of scenario. The momentum-driven wind model\nprovides us with a physically motivated and observationally\nconstrained way to tie outflow properties to the star forming properties of the host galaxy. Furthermore, it provides\nthe impetus for our approach of tying local observations of\nstarbursts with outflows across cosmic time.\nThe idea of using winds observed in local starbursts as a\ntemplate for winds at all epochs in all galaxies may seem like\nquite a leap of faith. Locally, starbursts are relatively rare\nobjects, so it is unclear whether galactic winds are ubiquitous and tied solely to the galaxy's star formation rate. However, as Heckman et al. (2000) showed there is a threshold of\nstar formation surface density of around 0.1 M\u2299 yr\u22121 kpc\u22122\nabove which winds are typically seen, and unlike with local star forming disks, virtually all star forming galaxies at\nhigh redshift satisfy this criterion because they are more\ncompact and more vigorously forming stars (Heckman et al.\n2000; Erb et al. 2006). Hence down to z \u223c 1.5 at least, it is\nplausible that essentially all galaxies are forming stars that\ndrive galactic superwinds. Indeed, direct observations of Lyman break galaxies at z \u223c 2 \u2212 3 by Pettini et al. (2001) and\nShapley et al. (2003) show outflows of hundreds of km/s. Of\ncourse, there is no guarantee that outflows from these highredshift systems follow similar relations as local starbursts,\nbut as we shall see this Occam's razor assumption turns out\nto be remarkably successful.\nGuided by local observations, we choose to focus mainly\non a class of models based on momentum-driven winds. As\nMurray, Quatert, & Thompson (2005) describes, in such a\nmodel the wind speed scales as the galaxy velocity dispersion (see their eqn. 17), as observed by Martin (2005). Since\nin momentum-driven winds the amount of input momentum\nper unit star formation is constant (their eqn. 12), this implies that the mass loading factor must be inversely proportional to the velocity dispersion (their eqn. 13). We therefore\nimplement the following relations:\nvwind\n\n=\n\n3\u03c3\n\np\n\nfL \u2212 1,\n\n(2)\n\n\fSimulations of IGM Enrichment\n\u03b7\n\n=\n\n\u03c30\n,\n\u03c3\n\n(3)\n\nwhere fL is the luminosity factor, which is the luminosity of the galaxy in units of the critical (or sometimes\ncalled Eddington) luminosity of the galaxy, and \u03c30 provides\na normalization for the mass loading factor. Here we assume that the final radius that the wind is driven to is\napproximately 100\u00d7 the initial radius, i.e. r/R0 \u223c 100 in\nthe Murray, Quatert, & Thompson (2005) formalism; the\ndependence on this term is weak. Since we are unable to\nreliably calculate galaxy stellar velocity dispersions directly\nin our simulations owing to a lack ofp\nresolution, we approximate \u03c3 using virial theorem as \u03c3 = \u2212 12 \u03a6, where \u03a6 is the\ngravitational potential at the location of the particle being\nplaced into the wind.\nWe enlist observations and some theoretical considerations to determine the free parameters \u03c30 and fL .\nMurray, Quatert, & Thompson (2005) argue that for a\nSalpeter IMF and a typical starburst SED, \u03c30 = 300 km/s.\nAs we will show, the mass loading factor controls star formation at early times, so \u03c30 can also be set by requiring a\nmatch to the observed global star formation rate. It turns\nout that for our assumed cosmology, \u03c30 = 300 km/s broadly\nmatches this constraint as well, so we will use this value\nthroughout for our momentum-driven wind models.\nMartin (2005) suggests fL\n\u2248\n2, while\nRupke, Veilleux & Sanders (2005) find a range of values fL \u2248 1.05 \u2212 2. In a momentum-driven wind scenario,\nthe relevant luminosity is set by the Lyman continuum\nemission from the stars that is absorbed by the dust\nparticles that propel the wind. In such a radiation pressure\nscenario, stars with lower metallicity that produce greater\nLyman continuum emission (such as those in the early\nuniverse) would be expected to drive stronger winds. Stellar\nmodels by Schaerer (2003) suggest an approximate functional form for far-UV emission as a function of metallicity\n(his equation 1), which we use to obtain the following\nrelation:\nfL = fL,\u2299 \u00d7 10\u22120.0029\u2217(log Z+9)\n\n2.5\n\n+0.417694\n\n.\n\n(4)\n\nFor Z = 0.02 (solar metallicity), the value of the exponent\nis zero, making fL = fL,\u2299 , while e.g. for a metallicity of\n10\u22123 Z\u2299 , fL = 1.7fL,\u2299 . The metallicity used to determine\nfL is that of the gas particle entering the wind. We typically use fL,\u2299 = 2 from Martin (2005), since the galaxies\nobserved in that sample generally have around solar metallicity (or perhaps a tenth-solar, which makes little difference). We will also consider models where we do not include\nthis low-metallicity boost, and yet other models where we\nallow the fL,\u2299 to randomly vary between 1.05 \u2212 2 in accord\nwith Rupke, Veilleux & Sanders (2005).\nThe form of the mass loading factor \u03b7 is also\nuncertain. While the momentum-driven wind model of\nMurray, Quatert, & Thompson (2005) predicts \u03b7 \u221d 1/\u03c3, observations seem to find little if any trend of \u03b7 with \u03c3 (Martin\n1999; Rupke, Veilleux & Sanders 2005). There does appear\nto be a large scatter, so some trends may be hidden in the\nscatter, and it is worth noting that constraining the mass\nloading factor is even more uncertain than determining outflow speeds. Hence we use equation 3 as our fiducial relations, but we will also consider a model where vwind varies\naccording to equation 2 and \u03b7 is constant.\n\n5\n\nTable 1.

The winds are generally driven\nin a manner that continually increases its velocity\nout to some decoupling radius as in equation (15) of\nMurray, Quatert, & Thompson (2005); this radius can be\nquite large, perhaps \u223c 150h\u22121 kpc for typical winds. However, our implementation only gives an instantaneous kick\nto a gas particle entering a wind, and does not continue to\naccelerate it further. In order to account for this discrepancy,\nwe optionally give the winds an additional kick corresponding to the local escape velocity (given by 2\u03c3), so that the\nescaping wind will have approximately the desired velocity\nas it leaves its galaxy's halo. This may be an overcorrection,\nbut if the wind is actively driven to well outside the halo\nscale radius, this should be a fairly good approximation.\n\n2.4\n\nRuns and Outflow Models\n\nIn summary, we consider the following outflow models:\n\u2022 \"nw\" model: No winds.\n\u2022 \"cw\" model: Constant winds: vwind = 484 km/s, \u03b7 =\n2. This is the model used in SH03 and many subsequent\npapers using those simulations.\n\u2022 \"zw\" model: vwind from eqn. 2, a constant \u03b7 = 2, and\nfL from eqn. 4. Note that this is not formally a momentumdriven wind model.\n\u2022 \"mw\" model: Momentum-driven winds: vwind and \u03b7\nfrom eqns. 2 & 3, but without a 2\u03c3 kick and using fL =\nfL,\u2299 = 2 (no metallicity dependence).\n\u2022 \"mzw\" model: Momentum-driven winds as above,\nwith a varying fL as given in eqn. 4, fL,\u2299 = 2 and with\na 2\u03c3 kick.\n\u2022 \"vzw\" model: Like mzw, but where fL,\u2299 is allowed to randomly vary between 1.05 \u2212 2, as observed by\nRupke, Veilleux & Sanders (2005).\nTable 1 lists parameters for our three simulation volumes having 8, 16, and 32 h\u22121 Mpc (comoving) box lengths.\nEach volume is run for all of the above wind models. The\ninitial conditions used are identical for all the wind models,\nand are generated when the universe was still well within the\nlinear regime using an Eisenstein & Hu (1999) transfer function with \u03a9m = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, h = 0.7, n = 1, \u03c38 = 0.9, and\n\u03a9b = 0.04. Each run has 2563 gas and dark matter particles,\nwith gas particle mass resolutions spanning 5 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 to\n\n\f6\n\nB. D. Oppenheimer & R. Dav\u00e9\n\n3 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 . Our smallest volume still doesn't quite resolve\nthe Jeans mass in the high-z IGM (Schaye et al. 2000), but\nbecause we will mostly examine C iv absorption which arises\nin moderate overdensity regions, our resolution constraints\nare less stringent, as we discuss in \u00a76. We will mainly focus\non the 16 h\u22121 Mpc box simulations, because as we show in\nour resolution convergence study in \u00a76, this is the largest\nvolume for which we can robustly predict C iv observables.\n2.5\n\nSpectral Generation\n\nFrom these simulations, we extract the optical depths along\nrandom lines of sight for 25 ions representing 12 species,\nalong with density, temperature, and metallicity for each\natomic species (which differ because of thermal broadening),\nall as a function of redshift. We use CLOUDY to calculate\nionization fractions assuming an optically thin slab of gas\nwith the given density, temperature, and impinging ionizing\nradiation field (see \u00a72.6). The 25 ions selected have been previously observed in optical/UV absorption line spectra, even\nthough many ions are too weak to show up in our simulated\nspectra, as well as theoretical expectations for IGM densities\nand temperatures (Hellsten et al. 1998). The three ions that\nare considered in this work are H i, C iv, and C iii, while the\nremainder are included only to simulate chance contamination. The main contaminants are N v, O vi, Si ii, Si iii, and\nSi iv. When using the pixel optical depth (POD) method\n(Ellison et al. 1999; Aguirre et al. 2002; Aracil et al. 2004),\nwe must generate the contaminants as accurately as possible, and we use alpha-enhanced abundances ([N/C]=-0.7,\n[O/C]=0.5, [Si/C]=0.4 where [C/Fe]=0.0), even though this\nincreases the total amount of metals by about 150% because\nhalf of all metals are oxygen. For much of our analysis however, we generate uncontaminated C iv spectra and compare\nto data where contaminants have been removed. Our goal in\nthis paper is to explore how simulated observations evolve\nover our redshift range, so we leave for the future a more\npainstakingly detailed comparison (as done for Ly\u03b1 in e.g.\nDav\u00e9 & Tripp 2001).\nOur software, called specexbin, extracts spectra at angles such that the lines of sight can wrap around the periodic\nsimulation box and continuously sample different structure.\nWe generally run 30 lines of sight at 30 separate angles between 10 and 82 degrees (angles too close to 0 and 90 will\nkeep sampling the same structure) for a simulation beginning at z = 6 and ending at the redshift of the final output\n(usually z = 1.5). We choose 30 lines of sight because we\nwant a sample size comparable to a survey of quasar spectra\nachievable currently or in the near-term future, so that we\ncan calculate relevant error bars in our plots. A single line of\nsight between z = 6.0 \u2192 1.5 will traverse a 16 h\u22121 Mpc box\nstraight across approximately 150 times. We extract from\nsimulation snapshots at least every 0.25z, while varying the\nionization background as described in the next subsection\nand smoothly accounting for Hubble expansion.\nspecexbin first calculates the physical properties (gas\ndensity, temperature, metallicity, and velocity) as a function\nof position along the line of sight by averaging the contribution of every SPH particle whose smoothing kernel overlaps\nthe current pixel. To generate a spectrum in velocity space\n(redshift space), one needs to include the effects of Hubble\nexpansion, bulk motions of the gas, and thermal broadening.\n\nFor each ionic species, the ionization fraction is determined\nat each position by using a lookup table where the inputs\nare density and temperature, assuming ionization equilibrium. The ionization fraction is then re-binned into velocity\nspace with the inclusion of thermal broadening specific to\neach atomic species. The oscillator strength of the line converts this value to an optical depth. The metallicity for each\natomic species in velocity space is saved along with the optical depths assuming solar metallicity so the we can apply\nany desired metallicity distribution. We typically take the\nmetallicity directly from our simulations, but this approach\nretains the option of applying an external \u03c1 \u2212 Z relation.\nWe then compute fluxes from the optical depths outputted by specexbin. We generate 0.05 \u00c5-resolution spectra, then convolve with an instrumental profile typical of\nan Echelle spectrograph such as HIRES or the Very Large\nTelescope's Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph\n(VLT/UVES), in particular R \u2261 \u03bb/d\u03bb = 43, 000, and finally add Gaussian noise (S/N = 100 per pixel). As alluded\nto above, we make two type of spectra: C iv-only spectra\nwith only the 1548 \u00c5 C iv component, and complete spectra with all 25 ions included. We use C iv-only spectra to\nmeasure C iv column densities and b-parameters, and to\ncalculate \u03a9(C iv) (see \u00a75.2.1). We use the complete spectra when we apply the pixel optical depth (POD) method\n(see \u00a75.3), because contamination can affect the C iv flux\ndecrement. We make multiple spectra for each line of sight,\nplacing the quasar redshifts such that all portions of the C iv\nforest from z = 6.0 \u2192 1.5 are \"observed\" at wavelengths uncontaminated by the Ly\u03b1 forest (e.g. zQSO =6.0, 5.0, 4.1,\n3.4, etc.).\nFigure 1 demonstrates how Ly\u03b1 flux, C iv flux, density, temperature, and metallicity appear at three different\nredshifts in one of our lines of sight. Some of the trends\napparent in this model spectrum relate to the main conclusions of this paper. First, the evolution in C iv absorption\nis significantly less than that seen for Ly\u03b1 due to the complicated interplay between enrichment, photoionization, and\nIGM heating in expanding large-scale structure. At higher\nredshifts, C iv absorption faithfully traces metal enrichment,\nbut at lower redshifts this correlation becomes significantly\nweaker.\nExcept where noted, we will group individual Voigtprofile fit C iv absorbers (i.e. \"components\") into \"systems\"\nif they lie within 100 km s\u22121 of another. This is done in\norder to facilitate a more robust comparison among data of\nvarying quality and to avoid systematics arising from different line fitting techniques. For example, in Figure 1, the\nC iv line at z = 1.594 is a single component while the lines\naround z = 4.1 form a multi-component system.\n2.6\n\nUV Background\n\nWe apply a spatially-uniform photoionizing background is\ntaken from Haardt & Madau (2001) to the matter distribution, both during the simulation runs and during the spectral\nextraction. Unless otherwise noted, the background used is\nthe one that is comprised of quasars and 10% of UV photons escaping from star-forming galaxies (referred to as QG),\nwhich turns on at z \u2248 9. The slope of the QG background is\nsofter than the Haardt & Madau (1996) quasar-only background short-wards of 1050 \u00c5 (\u03b1 = \u22121.8 vs. \u03b1 = \u22121.55).\n\n\fSimulations of IGM Enrichment\n\n7\n\nFigure 1. Example simulated spectra from the w16n256vzw simulation at three redshifts, z \u2248 1.5, 3.0, & 4.5, showing Ly\u03b1 absorption,\nC iv absorption, and the underlying overdensity, temperature and metallicity distributions. Black lines show the properties with peculiar\nvelocities and thermal broadening applied, while green lines show the underlying physical distribution.\n\nThe amplitude of the QG background can be constrained by approximately matching the Ly\u03b1 flux decrement, DLy\u03b1 , to observed values over this redshift range. To\ndo so, we divide the background amplitude by 1.6 at all\nredshifts to match the observed mean Ly\u03b1 flux decrement,\nDLy\u03b1 . We do not do this during the simulation run, but\nonly in post-processing as we extract the spectra, but as\nCroft et al. (1998) showed, because photoionization is subdominant in gas dynamics such a post facto correction yields\nvirtually identical results as having done the entire run with\nthe lower background.\n\nresults in 5.7% flux loss at z = 3 and 1.2% at z = 2. The data\npoints from Kirkman et al. (2005), which have been continuum fitted, show deviations in the highest redshift bins as\nexpected. Their data agree within reason with our measurements, except at z = 3.0 where they find a 22% lower DLy\u03b1 .\nOther than this measurement, we find that the HM01 ionizing background simply divided by 1.6 provides a good fit to\nthe available data. The fact that we don't need a redshiftdependent correction indicates that the HM01 background\nin conjunction with density growth in our assumed \u039bCDM\nuniverse yields the correct evolution for DLy\u03b1 .\n\nIn Figure 2 we compare the mean flux decrement in our\nspectra to measurements by Press et al. (1993), Rauch et al.\n(1997), and Kirkman et al. (2005), which have been corrected for metal line contamination. The Press et al. (1993)\nfunctional fit and Rauch measurements are meant to measure the total DLy\u03b1 as they apply corrections for their continuum fitting at high redshift, hence we do not continuumfit our spectra for this comparison. Continuum fitting would\nhave a non-trivial effect on z & 3 where the Ly\u03b1 transmission almost never reaches 100% in our spectra. The difference declines at lower redshift; for instance, Dav\u00e9 et al.\n(1997) find that continuum fitting to the tops of Ly\u03b1 peaks\n\nInterestingly, our outflow models have typically a negligible effect on the Ly\u03b1 flux decrements, with the values mostly agreeing to 2% among the various simulations.\nThis indicates that winds are not affecting the density and\ntemperature structure over much of the Universe's volume,\nor put another way, the filling factor of winds is fairly\nsmall (as we will show more quantitatively in \u00a73.3). This\nis consistent with the results of Theuns et al. (2002b) and\nBertone & White (2006); the latter finding that the only\nquantitative effect of galactic winds on the Lyman-\u03b1 forest\nis an increase in the the number of sub-\u00c5 saturated regions\nresulting from dense shells plowed up by the winds.\n\n\f8\n\nB. D. Oppenheimer & R. Dav\u00e9\n\nFigure 2. Lyman-alpha flux decrement (DLy\u03b1 ) averaged over\n30 lines of sight generated from each outflow simulation, using a\nHM01 background amplitude divided by 1.6 across all redshifts.\nThis simple correction results in a simulated DLy\u03b1 evolution generally in accord with observations. Our outflow models have little\neffect on DLy\u03b1 .\n\n3\n3.1\n\nFigure 3. The total integrated star formation history compared\nto observations compiled by Hopkins (2004). Wind models suppress star formation from the no-wind case (long-dashed) to bring\nthen into broad agreement with data. The mass loading factor\ncontrols early star formation, while wind speeds become more\nimportant later on. Outflow models with large \u03b7 at early times\nsuppress star formation, resulting in a peak in global star formation at later times.\n\nGLOBAL PHYSICAL PROPERTIES\nStar Formation Rate Density\n\nA major impetus for including superwind feedback is to suppress star formation and solve the overcooling problem. As\nSH03 showed, the constant wind model broadly matches the\nobserved star formation history of the universe, the so-called\nMadau plot (Madau et al. 1996). Here we examine Madau\nplots for our various wind models to ensure that they fall\nwithin the observed range as well.\nFigure 3 shows the total star formation rate density as\na function of redshift averaged over our three simulation volumes, for all our wind models. Data points shown are from\na compilation by Hopkins (2004). We include all star formation in each volume, without selecting out any particular\ngalaxy population. In general, all our wind models roughly\nfall within the observed range down to their lowest redshift\n(z = 1.5 or z = 2), with possible discrepancies versus z & 3\ndata that are more poorly constrained. With no wind feedback, far too many stars are produced as found by SH03,\nwhile our various wind models suppress star formation at\nz \u223c 3 by \u223c \u00d73 \u2212 5 relative to no winds. Hence all our wind\nmodels broadly pass the Madau plot test.\nMore detailed examination reveals that there are some\ndifferences between wind models that yield insights into\nthe impact of varying feedback parameters. For instance,\nin models where we have a variable \u03b7 (mzw,mw,vzw) that\nproduces high mass loading factors at early times, we end\nup with a global star formation history that is peaked towards later epochs (zpeak \u2248 2\u22124) than in the constant \u03b7 = 2\ncases (cw,zw) which show zpeak \u2248 5. This arises because the\nhigh early mass loading factors in small early galaxies keep\ngas puffy and warm, suppressing early star formation despite the fact that the wind velocities are low. As a case in\npoint, note the vzw and mzw models show virtually identical star formation histories at high redshift despite having\nsignificantly different (mean) values of vwind , showing that\n\nit is indeed \u03b7 that primarily governs early star formation.\nThe wind speed is not irrelevant, though, as that represents\nthe only difference between vzw and mzw, and they show\nnoticeable differences at later epochs. There, the universe\nbecomes less dense, winds travel farther, and cooling rates\nare lower, so the wind speed vwind increasingly governs the\nglobal star formation rate.\nAt face value, variable \u03b7 models appear to be in better agreement with observations that show zpeak \u223c 2 \u2212 3,\nparticularly the vzw model which shows a peak at z \u223c 2.\nHowever, since we are not selecting galaxy populations in\nthe simulation analogous to observed samples from which\nthe data are calculated, such comparisons are at best preliminary. For now, we simply note that the feedback recipe\ncan have significant impact on the global star formation history, including the peak of the star formation rate density\nin the Universe, and all wind models we consider here fall\nbroadly within the allowed range.\n3.2\n\nOutflow Properties\n\nAs outflows represent the main new feature of our simulations, it is worth examining their properties in more detail.\nHere we highlight the differences between wind models in\ntheir typical speeds, mass loading factors, and energy deposition rates as a function of redshift. These provide useful\nbackground information for understanding the behavior of\nC iv absorption in our various outflows scenarios.\nFigure 4 (upper left) shows the mean wind speed as a\nfunction of redshift for our various wind models. The zw and\nmzw models show similar wind speeds because they both\nemploy equation 2, while the mw model shows lowered wind\nspeeds primarily because it lacks the 2\u03c3 kick. The mean\nvzw wind speed is more in line with the mw model at z . 6,\nbut vzw produces a wider range of wind velocities due to\nits random assignment of fL,\u2299 , and hence ends up being\n\n\fSimulations of IGM Enrichment\nquite different than mw in many other ways. The boost from\nlow-metallicity stars (not present in mw) is only important\nat very early times, because stars enrich themselves fairly\nquickly (Dav\u00e9 et al. 2006), and once the metallicity exceeds\naround 1% of solar the boost becomes fairly small. The mean\nwind speed when we employ equation 2 becomes comparable\nto the constant wind case (horizontal line) at z \u223c 2. It is\nworth noting that the wind speeds at z \u223c 3 in all our models\nare comparable to the range of outflow velocities observed\nin Lyman break galaxies (Pettini et al. 2001).\nThe upper right panel of Figure 4 shows that allowing\nmass loading factor dependence according to equation 2 results in much more material being ejected from early galaxies. Of course, because the wind speeds are small and material is infalling gravitationally, the winds do not reach\nvery far before being re-accreted. However, they do keep the\ngas somewhat hotter and more diffusely distributed around\ngalaxies, so the high mass loading factors are effective at suppressing early star formation. Note that Dav\u00e9 et al. (2006)\nfound that such suppression is necessary in order to match\nobserved z \u223c 6 galaxy luminosity functions. At low redshifts, Erb et al. (2006) estimated a required typical mass\nloading of around 4 in order to understand the trends observed in the galaxy mass-metallicity relation at z \u2248 2; our\nmomentum-driven winds broadly agree with this.\nIn the bottom two panels of Figure 4, we show the kinetic energy injected by the winds (left), and the amount\nof energy that reaches the IGM once subtracting off the energy required to leave the potential well and enter the IGM\n(right). We normalize these quantities to the average supernova energy for a Salpeter IMF, namely 4 \u00d7 1048 ergs per\nM\u2299 of star formation (the fiducial value used by SH03).\nThe cw model was constructed by SH03 to return 100%\nof the supernova energy into kinetic feedback (although\nthermal feedback was included in addition), while the energy input from the momentum-driven wind models increases as galaxies grow. Eventually, the energy inputted\nby winds exceeds the supernova energy; this is physically\npossible because these winds are driven by UV radiation\nfrom massive stars over their entire lifetimes. An important feature of momentum-driven winds is that deeper\npotential wells in larger galaxies do not inhibit feedback\nof energy into the IGM, in accord with observations by\nRupke, Veilleux & Sanders (2005). The reverse is true for\nthe cw model, where the energy injection into the IGM is\nquite high at high-z and declines to lower redshift, which\nas we shall see leads to excessive heating of the IGM (see\n\u00a73.3 and Aguirre et al. 2005). Indeed, Ferrara et al. (2000)\nshowed that metal enrichment via supernova-driven winds\nalone is energetically insufficient to enrich the IGM to the\nobserved levels, and another unknown mechanism was required; momentum-driven winds provide such a mechanism.\n3.3\n\nIGM Enrichment and Heating\n\nWinds add metals and energy simultaneously to the intergalactic medium, and both quantities affect the characteristics of metal absorption in the diffuse IGM. In this section\nwe examine how outflow parameters affect the evolution of\nmetallicity and temperature in the IGM.\nFigure 5, upper left, plots the mass-averaged metallicity\nin gas in our various runs. These curves track the cumula-\n\n9\n\ntive amount of star formation in each run, with the slight\ndifference that metals locked up in stars are not included in\nthis plot. Consistent with expectations from Figure 3, the\nno-wind case has the largest amount of metal mass, while\nmzw and vzw have the smallest global metal production.\nComparing that plot to the volume-averaged metallicity in the upper right panel shows some interesting differences. Note that when quantifying IGM metallicity using\nabsorption lines, it most directly traces the volume-averaged\nmetallicity. In our outflow models, the amount of metals that\nenters into the IGM depends on a complicated interplay between the mass of metals (or stars) formed, the wind speeds,\nand the mass-loading factor. The large wind speeds in the\nconstant wind case, together with relatively vigorous star\nformation, produce the most widely distributed metals, with\na mean metallicity at z \u223c 3 of \u2248 1% solar. The difference\nbetween zw and mzw, which have similar wind speeds, arises\nbecause the low mass loading factor in zw yields more star\nformation and hence more metals. The lower wind speeds in\nmw and vzw produce relatively low volume-averaged metallicities. Canonical values inferred from C iv observations at\nz \u223c 3 suggest [C/H]\u2248 \u22122.5 (e.g. Songaila & Cowie 1996;\nDav\u00e9 et al. 1998), which is broadly consistent with all the\nwind models. We will engage in more careful comparisons to\nobservations in \u00a75.\n\nThe no-wind model does not distribute metals into the\nIGM hardly at all ([C/H]volume never exceeds -5.0), leaving most of its volume pristine, and showing that dynamical stripping of enriched gas owing to interactions cannot enrich the diffuse IGM. Our results are in qualitative agreement with high-resolution Eulerian simulations by\nGnedin & Ostriker (1997) with no winds, having spatial resolution comparable to our runs but in much smaller volumes.\nThey found a volume-averaged metallicity of \u2248 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 at\nz = 4, which is an order of magnitude higher than what we\nfind but is still much too low to enrich the diffuse IGM to\nthe observed levels.\nThe two middle panels show the filling factor with\nmetallicity greater than one-thousandth solar (left) and the\nvolume-averaged temperature (right). The trends in these\npanels are related. In order to expel metals to large distances\nand fill volume, high wind speeds are required that results in\nhigh IGM temperatures. Hence the trends are similar among\nour wind models in the two plots: Constant winds produce\nhigh filling factors and large temperatures, zw and mzw are\nvirtually identical, while the mw and vzw models fill less of\nthe volume and hardly heat the IGM much above the primarily photoionization-established temperatures seen in the\nno-wind case. Interestingly, the spread of velocities in the\nvzw model both enrich the IGM while injecting relatively\nlittle energy, which as we will show turns out to be favored\nby observations.\nThe volume filling factor increases with time in all models because (1) metals have escaped their potential wells and\nare coasting away from their parent galaxies, and (2) galaxies are forming in less biased regions at later times. The\nvolume filled in the cw model begins to asymptote as hierarchical buildup occurs and metals ejected by small galaxies falls back into larger halos. The volume will eventually\nasymptote for the other models, but at lower redshift since\nthe smaller enriched volumes around galaxies will not over-\n\n\f10\n\nB. D. Oppenheimer & R. Dav\u00e9\n\nFigure 4. Wind property averages as a function of redshift for various outflow models. Panels (a) and (b) show the average wind\nvelocity and mass loading factor, respectively. Panel (c) shows the energy inputted into the wind particles, and panel (d) shows the\nenergy injected into the IGM, after we subtract the energy needed to leave the potential well of the galaxy. The energies are normalized\nby the energy injection from supernovae. The wind speeds and mass loading factors at z \u223c 2 \u2212 3 in momentum-driven wind models are in\nagreement with observations by Pettini et al. (2001); Erb et al. (2006). The energy input can significantly exceed that from supernovae\nin our momentum-driven wind models, but this is physically plausible since radiation energy is the primary driver of momentum-driven\nwinds.\n\nlap until later, and because the peak star formation is shifted\nto later epochs.\nAs a side note, Schaye et al. (2000) demonstrated that\nat z \u223c 3, the temperature of the IGM as traced by Ly\u03b1\nabsorption line widths is \u2248 1.5 \u2212 2 \u00d7 104 K. This temperature is above that expected for pure photoionization (e.g.\nHernquist et al. 1996, or alternatively our no-wind case),\nwhich they interpret as arising from latent heat owing to\nHe ii reionization. Our mzw and zw models broadly agree\nwith the Schaye et al. (2000) measurement, but in our case\nthe excess heat is due to outflow energy deposition. Hence\noutflows can produce elevated temperatures without requiring He ii reionization (Sokasian et al. 2003). We leave more\ndetailed studies of Ly\u03b1 line widths for future work.\nThe lower left panel of Figure 5 shows the energy injected into the IGM per year per h\u22121 Mpc3 , in terms of\namount of supernova energy produced. This energy injected\n2\nis proportional to \u03b7\u00d7SFR\u00d7vIGM\nwhere vIGM is the velocity after leaving the potential well of the galaxy. The large\namounts of early feedback energy in the cw model explains\n\nhow its IGM becomes so hot by z = 6. The momentum wind\nmodels peak in their energy output at z = 2\u22124, with weaker\nwinds peaking later. We will show later that this heat input\nresults in significant variations in the global ionization fraction of C iv, which is a key ingredient in understanding C iv\nevolution.\nThe lower right panel shows the amount of metals in the\nIGM where \u03c1/\u03c1\u0304 < 100 relative to that at z = 2. This shows\nthat in all models, the amount of IGM metals at z = 6 is\nless than one-eighth of that at z = 2. In other words, in all\nof our models the vast majority of metals are injected into\nthe IGM during z = 6 \u2192 2, rather than at z & 6. Note that\nwe do not include any \"pre-enrichment\" from exotic star\nformation at early times; our models are instead intended\nto test whether normal star formation in ordinary galaxies\ncan enrich the IGM with outflow models included.\nOverall, these results highlight the importance of the\noft-overlooked connection between metal and energy input\ninto the IGM. The mass-loading factor \u03b7 roughly governs\nthe amount of total metal production at early times, while\n\n\fSimulations of IGM Enrichment\n\n11\n\nFigure 5. IGM properties averaged over the simulation box for various outflow models as a function of redshift. Panel (a) displays the\nglobal mass-weighted gas-phase metallicity, a quantity proportional to stellar mass except that the metals locked up in stars are not\nincluded. Panels (b) shows the volume-weighted metallicity, which is governed more by outflow speeds than by metal production, as\nthe relative trends between models follow that seen in Figure 4a. Panel (c) shows the fractional volume of the simulation enriched to\nover [Z/H]> \u22123, which again is broadly governed by outflow speeds. Note that the no-wind cases is unable to enrich more than 0.1% of\nthe volume at any epoch. Panel (d) shows the volume-weighted temperature, showing that constant winds dramatically enhances IGM\ntemperature, while momentum-driven wind models heat the IGM substantially less. Panel (e) shows the amount of energy reaching the\nIGM in terms of supernova energy per year, per h\u22121 Mpc; this is essentially a cumulative version of Figure 4d. Panel (f) shows the\namount of metals in the diffuse IGM (\u03c1/\u03c1\u0304 < 100) relative to the z = 2 IGM metallicity; an increase of \u223c \u00d710 from z = 6 \u2192 2 is typical.\n\n\f12\n\nB. D. Oppenheimer & R. Dav\u00e9\n\nthe outflow velocity vwind mostly determines the physical\nextent to which the diffuse IGM (\u03c1/\u03c1\u0304 < 10) is enriched and\nheated. As we shall see, the complicated interplay between\nmetal production rate, wind speed, mass loading factor, and\nradiative cooling makes observations of IGM metallicity a\nhighly sensitive probe of the physics of large-scale outflows.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nPHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF METALS AND\nC IV ABSORBERS\nEvolution of Metals in the IGM\n\nFigure 6 shows density, temperature, metallicity, and C iv\nabsorption at z =4.5, 3.0, and 1.5, in 15 \u00d7 15 h\u22121 Mpc slices\nthat are 100 km s\u22121 wide, from the w16n256vzw model.\nWe have deliberately centered the velocity slice on an overdense region (both in density and C iv absorption) to show\nthe large variety of structures formed. This figure illustrates\nsome of the trends that will be quantified in upcoming sections1 .\nThe growth of large-scale structure, dominated by gravitational instability, is evident in the gas density snapshots\n(top panels). Outflows increase the metal filling factor while\ngrowing the metallicity level in previously enriched regions.\nBubbles of shocked gas grow around star forming systems\nand trace the filamentary structures that house galaxies. In\nthe high-redshift snapshot, much of the heating is due to\nwinds, as the hot bubbles trace precisely where the metals\nappear. Later, as a proto-group forms in the center of this\nregion, the temperature also tracks the virialization of gas\nin the growing potential well. Interestingly, cold mode accretion (Kere\u0161 et al. 2005) is evident along the dense filaments\nfeeding galaxies; hence despite the heat input, outflows do\nlittle to stop rapid accretion at high redshifts, because they\ntend to flow into lower density regions.\nThe C iv absorption is shown in front of a backlit screen\nto highlight the morphology of absorption, such as if our\nUniverse was infinite and static (Olbers 1826). In reality,\nquasars provide the backlight, and any quasar only probes a\nsingle pixel. At z = 4.5, nearly all metals show C iv absorption when the ionization fractions are highest in the IGM.\n\u03c4 (C iv)\u223c 0.05 \u2212 0.10 traces IGM gas with \u03c1/\u03c1\u0304 = 3 \u2212 10 and\n\u03c4 (C iv)> 0.10 traces \u03c1/\u03c1\u0304 = 10 \u2212 30 between z = 4.5 \u2212 6.0,\na time when the vast majority of these overdensities remain\nunenriched by our prescribed winds. By z = 3.0, metals have\nenriched the filaments, which show up as strong absorbers\nconnecting the growing galaxy groups. By z = 1.5, much of\nthe diffuse IGM carbon is ionized to higher states, and C iv\npreferentially traces higher overdensity structure.\nFigure 7 shows the mass and metal evolution in the diffuse IGM (\u03c1/\u03c1\u0304 < 100, T < 30, 000 K) in the top panels,\nthe warm-hot IGM (WHIM, \u03c1/\u03c1\u0304 < 100, T > 30, 000 K) in\nthe middle, and the condensed IGM (\u03c1/\u03c1\u0304 > 100, includes\nstars) on the bottom for the cw, mzw, vzw, and nw models. The mass fraction in diffuse gas falls in all models from\nz = 6 \u2192 2, as mass transitions mostly to the WHIM phase\nresulting from both shock heating on large-scale structure\nand energy feedback. Not surprisingly, the WHIM fraction\n1\n\nFor\nmovies\nof\nthis\nevolution,\nhttp://luca.as.arizona.edu/~oppen/IGM/ .\n\nsee\n\nfollows the mean temperature evolution in Figure 5. The no\nwind model provides a baseline for the amount of WHIM\nformed purely from growth of structure. At z = 2, the cw\nmodel has a WHIM fraction of 50%, double the nw case,\nindicating half the WHIM results from feedback, and even\nmore at higher redshift. The WHIM formed by energy feedback is moderate in the mzw case, and slight in the vzw\nmodel, thus leading to our conclusion that the fraction of\nWHIM formed by feedback depends most on wind speed.\nMeanwhile, the condensed phase understandably grows the\nfastest in the nw case, while the vzw model clearly distinguishes itself from other two feedback models shown here by\nproducing more condensed matter resulting from low wind\nvelocities unable to escape their parent haloes.\nBoth wind parameters, vwind and \u03b7, have a significant\neffect on the fraction of metals in various phases, especially\ncompared to the nw case where virtually no metals leave the\ncondensed phase. The cw model has a significant amount of\nmetals in the condensed phase due to its lower mass loading\nfactor, but the metals that do escape into the IGM usually\nare shocked to WHIM temperatures. In momentum-driven\nwinds (vzw and mzw), although \u03b7 is larger which suppresses\nstar formation, the lower wind speeds allow more metals to\nreturn to the condensed phase, more so in the vzw case.\nThe mean gas metallicities (minus the stars in the condensed phase) are plotted in the right set of Figure 7. The\ncondensed gas has a slowly-evolving metallicity of 5-20%\nsolar in all wind models at these epochs at z < 4. This\nenrichment level and evolution is similar to that seen for\ndamped Ly\u03b1 systems (Prochaska et al. 2003), which are expected to arise in condensed gas. In contrast, diffuse gas\nshows a steadily increasing metallicity in all models, as star\nformation and winds combine to drive metals into the diffuse IGM. Interestingly, all wind models show similar diffuse\nphase metallicities and mass fractions, a result of the selfregulating nature of feedback (i.e. more feedback curtails\nstar formation and metallicity enrichment). The WHIM at\nhigh redshift is primarily the result of feedback and is more\nenriched than the diffuse IGM. As virialization forms more\nWHIM at lower redshift, the WHIM metallicity becomes\nmore similar to that of the diffuse IGM.\nThese figures illustrate that winds polluting the IGM\nalso affect the temperature structure of the IGM, making\nC iv absorption an evolving tracer of metallicity. Next we\nquantify these trends from the perspective of C iv absorbers.\n4.2\n\nC iv Absorption in Phase Space\n\nCurrently the only observational probe we have of diffuse\nhigh-redshift IGM gas are one-dimensional quasar absorption line spectra skewering a complex matter distribution.\nIn this section we present physical properties of the underlying gas for C iv absorption in our simulated spectra, in\nterms of the cosmic phase space (overdensity & temperature) of absorbing gas. We focus on the cw, mw, mzw, and\nvzw models as a representative range of wind scenarios: cw\ndisplays abundant early energy and metal injection, mw has\ncomparatively little metals injection and almost no increased\ntemperature compared to the no-wind case (see Figure 5),\nwhile mzw and vzw represent two intermediate cases that, as\nwe shall see, are our favored models, with vzw being slightly\npreferred. Hence for illustrative plots we shall utilize the vzw\n\n\fSimulations of IGM Enrichment\n\n13\n\nFigure 6. A 100 km s\u22121 slice of the w16n256vzw simulation centered on a growing galaxy group at z = 4.5, 3.0, and 1.5. In addition to\nthe well-understood growth of large-scale structure (overdensity), the middle panels show that metal enrichment is tied with the early\nheating of the IGM, especially at high-z before virialization dominates at low redshift. C iv absorption traces nearly all metals at high-z,\nand then declines to trace only the most overdense structures at low-z as the overall ionization correction rises. Close inspection of the\nabsorption structures indicates an evolution from smooth and diffuse to clumpy knots tracing the higher overdensities at low-z.\n\nmodel, with the understanding that the qualitative trends\nare similar in other models unless otherwise noted.\nFigure 8 shows the ionization fraction as a function\nof density and temperature, in three different redshift intervals for the w16n256vzw model. The ionization fraction\nshows two distinct regions: A horizontal band corresponding to collisional ionization around 105 K, and a diagonal\nband at lower temperatures and densities corresponding to\nphotoionization. Dashed contours overlaid on top of these\nshaded regions trace the total mass distribution from the\nvzw model. C iv absorption would be visible where these\ncontours overlap the shaded regions, if metals are present.\nMetallicity (solid) contours that overlap shaded regions represent areas that are in fact traced by C iv for the vzw model.\nOne interesting result from this figure is that C iv is\nnot an optimal tracer of photo-ionized IGM gas, particularly at lower redshifts. C v (40.3\u00c5) would be a better tracer,\nbut such an observation requires X-ray spectroscopy far beyond the current capabilities. Conversely, there is significant\namounts of gas heated to around 105 K in this and the other\nmodels, in which C iv should be prominent, even at high\nredshifts. The number of actual observed systems as a function of density is governed by an additional factor, namely\nthe physical cross-section of the absorbing gas; this will be\ngreater at lower densities, which is why weak C iv absorption is still more common despite having a relatively low\nC iv ionization fraction.\nComparing the solid and dashed contours also shows\n\nthat in the diffuse IGM, which holds the majority of baryons\nand the vast majority of volume at these epochs, contains\nfew metals. Hence the filling factor of metals is small (as\nseen in Figure 5), especially at high-z. The magenta dashed\nline in the two lower redshift bins is the density-temperature\nrelationship used by S03 to derive their mass-metallicity relation, obtained by assuming that the metals occupy the\ndiffuse IGM and can be described by a 1-dimensional \u03c1 \u2212 T\nrelationship corresponding to the IGM equation of state.\nTheir \u03c1 \u2212 T relation is flatter because they assume substantial latent heat from H i reionization at z \u223c 6; we did\nnot include this because latest results from the Wilkinson\nMicrowave Anisotropy Probe show that the Universe was\npredominantly reionized out to z \u223c 10 (Page et al. 2006),\nand our Haardt & Madau (2001) model assumes reionization at z \u2248 9. The temperatures they use result in a global\nionization correction that does not change much over their\nredshift range, leading to their conclusion that their lack of\nevolution in the C iv systems implies little redshift evolution\nin the true IGM metallicity. From this plot, it is clear that\nour self-consistent enrichment models predict C iv absorbers\nlying in a wider range of densities and temperature, and are\nnot consistent with the assumption that C iv almost always\narises in a photoionized phase. We quantify this in the next\nsection.\nFigure 9 compares the metal mass contours from the\nprevious plot (shown as dashed contours) with the distribution of the actual C iv absorption (solid), in the (\u03c1, T ) plane,\n\n\f14\n\nB. D. Oppenheimer & R. Dav\u00e9\n\nFigure 7. The fractional mass, fractional metals, and mass-weighted metallicity of the IGM (from left to right) subdivided into diffuse\nIGM (\u03c1/\u03c1\u0304 < 100, T < 30, 000 K), warm-hot IGM (WHIM, \u03c1/\u03c1\u0304 < 100, T > 30, 000 K), and condensed IGM (\u03c1/\u03c1\u0304 > 100) (from top to\nbottom). The condensed component includes stellar mass and metals, although the [Z/H] measurement is just for the gas.\n\nfor the cw, mw, and vzw models (top, middle, and bottom\npanels, respectively). We obtain the C iv absorption density\nfrom the lines of sight in physical space, i.e. without peculiar velocities and thermal broadening that can significantly\nalter the relationship between absorption and physical properties. The two sets of contours illustrate the difference in\nphase space between the true metallicity and the metallicity\ntraced by C iv.\nThe three wind models shown tell very different stories\nabout IGM metallicity, observed and actual. The constant\nwind model has high wind speeds and greater star formation at high redshift, resulting in earlier enrichment of lower\noverdensities and the shock-heating of the IGM. The C iv\nionization fractions grow increasingly smaller at later times\nas the hot metals are ionized to higher states and cannot cool\nefficiently at such low densities. In contrast, the low wind\nspeeds of the mw model copiously enrich high overdensities\nwhile minimizing shock-heating, and lead to a higher overall\nC iv ionization fraction, allowing C iv to more closely trace\nthe metals. The intermediate vzw model with its variable\noutflow velocity has both higher wind speeds capable of injecting metals into the diffuse IGM and lower wind speeds\nreplenishing metals in the galactic halo gas. The result is\nIGM enrichment at a wider range of densities than mw with\n\nless feedback heating than cw, which as we shall see is a\nbetter match to observations. All forms of feedback result\nin metals occupying a large range of temperatures by z = 3\nresulting in many metal lines being collisionally ionized, a\nprediction also made by Theuns et al. (2002b) in their simulations with feedback.\nGenerally, at high redshifts C iv is a nice tracer of diffuse metals, but it misses the low-temperature high-density\nregime of the metal distribution (i.e. condensed phase metals) where much of the metals are residing. At z < 3, C iv\ntraces diffuse metals less well, because an increasing amount\nof metals arises in hot gas that is too highly collisionally ionized for C iv. It also fails to trace very diffuse gas that is too\nhighly photoionized for C iv. Hence in what could be termed\nthe \"Age of C iv\", this ion between z = 3 \u2212 4.5 is able to\ntrace metals over the largest range of overdensities corresponding to the largest variety of structures. As a side note,\nthe relative invariance in C iv absorption across these redshifts can be seen by the similar areas covered by the C iv\ncontours, despite the fact that the total metallicity (the area\nof the metallicity contour) is increasing with redshift; we will\nquantify this effect later.\nIn the low redshift bin, C iv traces typical overdensities of \u03c1/\u03c1\u0304 \u223c 100 despite the peak in metallicity mov-\n\n\fSimulations of IGM Enrichment\n\n15\n\nFigure 8. Solid (colored) contours show metal mass, while dashed contours show total mass plotted in \u03c1 \u2212 T phase space. Shading\ncorresponds to the ionization fraction in C iv. These contours have 0.5 dex steps and are normalized across the three redshift bins.\nThe shading goes from 0 \u2192 40% C iv ionization fraction, where the highest fraction occurs in collisionally ionized regions (T \u223c 105 at\n\u03c1/\u03c1\u0304 & 10). The magenta dashed line in the lower two redshift panels is the \u03c1 \u2212 T relation used by Schaye et al. (2003) to derive their\nmetallicity-density-redshift relationship. Metals occupy a large region of phase space leading to a variety of ionization conditions that\nevolve with redshift.\n\ning downwards to \u03c1/\u03c1\u0304 \u223c 30. This indicates that C iv absorption, particularly strong absorption, is arising primarily in galactic halo gas. Unfortunately for our simulations,\nif the gas in these halos has a structure similar to our\nMilky Way with cold clumps (i.e. high-velocity clouds) and a\ncomplex multi-phase structure (Mo & Miralda-Escud\u00e9 1996;\nMaller & Bullock 2004), then we cannot hope to resolve the\ndetailed density and temperature structure in our simulations. Indeed, observations by Simcoe et al. (2006) of quasar\nHS1700+6416 between z = 1.8 \u2192 2.7 suggest sub-kpc\nlength scales for many of the strongest absorbers. However,\nlensed quasar image pairs do not show significant deviations until above a few hundred pc in C iv line profiles indicating highly ionized gas traces structure on at least kpc\nscales (Rauch et al. 2001). While these observations probe\nthe IGM between z = 1.6 \u2192 3.6, smaller separations are\nprobed at higher redshifts, so it is difficult to determine if\nthe characteristic size of the absorber does in fact decrease\nat low redshift as our models predict.\n\nz = 4.0, mainly because the photo-ionized C iv component\nrapidly increases due to the changing ionization conditions.\nThe amount of collisionally ionized C iv never really drops,\nand grows rapidly below z = 2.5 in the vzw model as metalenriched gas collapses back into halos (especially overdensities \u03c1/\u03c1\u0304 > 300) leading to a \u223c50% collisionally ionized\nfraction at z \u223c 2.\nIn summary, C iv absorption in cosmic phase space\nclearly demonstrates that there is no one simple C iv absorber type relevant to all redshifts and large-scale structures we are investigating. Instead, the photo-ionized and\ncollisionally ionized absorption probe two different regions\nof the metal-enriched IGM that evolve independently over\nredshift. As the collisionally ionized component in particular\nis quite sensitive to the outflow model, C iv can in principle\nprovide interesting constraints on galactic feedback, especially at early epochs.\n\nFigure 9 further shows that C iv arises from both photoionized and collisionally ionized absorbers; we show a line\nabove which collisional ionization dominates. Interestingly,\nthe fraction of collisionally ionized C iv is highest at the\nearliest times despite a overall cooler IGM. The diffuse IGM\ndensities are too high and the background is too low to ionize\nmost metals to C iv, while at the same time the collisionallyionized band intersects regions with metals heated almost\nentirely by early feedback. It is because of this that early\nobservations of C iv absorption provide the greatest discrimination between feedback models, as we shall show more explicitly later on.\n\n4.3\n\nThe fractions of C iv collisionally ionized between z =\n5.5\u22126.0 are 68% and 43% for the cw and vzw models respectively. These fractions fall precipitously to 29% and 15% by\n\nMetallicity-Density Relationship\n\nSince metals are generated in galaxies that lie at highly biased peaks of the early matter distribution (e.g. Dav\u00e9 et al.\n2006), it is expected that there will be a positive correlation between metallicity and local overdensity. Indeed, such\na relation was determined based on C iv pixel optical depth\nstatistics by S03. They inferred that the median metallicity followed the relation [C/H] = \u22123.47 + 0.08 (z \u2212 3) +\n0.65 (log(\u03c1/\u03c1\u0304) \u2212 0.5) between z = 1.8 \u2212 4.1, i.e. that IGM\nmetallicity shows a moderate density gradient with little redshift evolution. Such a relationship provides a constraint on\nmodels of metal injection, though as we shall see this S03\nrelationship is sensitive to assumptions about the thermal\nstate of the gas which are not supported in our more successful wind models.\n\n\f16\n\nB. D. Oppenheimer & R. Dav\u00e9\n\nFigure 9. Dashed contours corresponding to metallicity mass (similar to those in Figure 8) and solid contours corresponding to the\nsummed C iv optical depth (derived from lines of sight) in \u03c1\u2212T phase space for three different redshift from the w16n256cw, w16n256mw,\nand w16n256vzw models. The blue line divides regions dominated by collisional ionization (top) and photo-ionization (bottom). The cw\nmodel predominantly enriches the low density IGM while causing significant shock-heating, whereas the mw model enriches mostly higher\noverdensities and heating occurs mostly due to virialization at low redshift. The vzw model manages to enrich a variety of overdensities\nwhile causing little more shock heating than the mw model.\n\nThe top panels of Figure 10 show the metallicity-density\nrelationship for all our wind models at three redshifts. These\nare not log-linear relationships as have often been assumed\nin fits (e.g. SO3). Instead, the metallicity-density relations\nare generally fairly flat out to some moderate overdensity,\nand then drop increasingly rapidly to lower overdensities.\nFurthermore, metallicities are continually growing at all\noverdensities in all our simulations as outflows extend to\nlower overdensities and the condensed regions are constantly\nreplenished with new metals from galactic superwinds.\nThe cw model shows some different behaviors compared\nto the momentum-driven wind cases. The large early wind\nspeeds in cw push metals so far out that the < Z/Z\u2299 >\nshows almost no gradient between \u03c1/\u03c1\u0304 = 1 \u2212 10, while various forms of the momentum wind models clearly show a\ngradient. For comparison, Cen et al. (2005) find a \"metal-\n\nlicity trough\" between \u03c1/\u03c1\u0304 = 0.1 \u2212 1 in their TIGER simulations, because their winds propagate from the most massive\ngalaxies anisotropically, enriching the underdense IGM to\nhigher metallicities than the filaments. The initial velocities\nin their model are 1469 km s\u22121 , which quickly slow down\nto a few hundred km s\u22121 after accumulating material. Our\ncw model is probably most similar to theirs, but with lower\noutflow velocities that are not quite sufficient to produce a\ndramatic inversion in the metallicity-density relation.\nThe momentum-driven wind models have a stronger\nmetallicity-density gradient, because smaller galaxies living\nat lower overdensities enrich smaller volumes with smaller\nvelocities. The vzw model has the smoothest gradient resulting from the assumed spread in velocities enriching a variety of overdensities. The zw model, despite its significantly\nlower mass loading factor than mzw, enriches all overden-\n\n\fSimulations of IGM Enrichment\n\n17\n\nFigure 10. Top panels show the mean metallicity as a function of overdensity for all our wind models in three redshift bins. For\ncomparison, the Schaye et al. (2003) relation with its log-normal distribution is included at the two lower redshifts. All models show\nsteady growth in metallicity at all overdensities as outflows reach lower overdensities while the metals are continuously replenished\naround galaxies. The bottom panels show the mean C iv/C ratio for all IGM gas independent of metallicity, demonstrating how the\noverall ionization fraction decreases and C iv preferentially traces more overdense gas. C iv absorption will be observed where the\nionization ratio and the metallicity are both significant. The differences between the models result from the effect of feedback on the\ntemperature structures of the IGM. The density-temperature relation assumed by S03 yields a steeper ionization fraction as a function\nof density (solid line), resulting in an inferred metallicity-density relation that is shallower than our simulations.\n\nsities more efficiently, because it has a higher overall star\nformation rate. Wind speed is the biggest determinant of\nmetallicity in the diffuse IGM (especially at \u03c1/\u03c1\u0304 < 10) while\nmass loading factor determines the metallicity of the condensed phases of the IGM (\u03c1/\u03c1\u0304 > 1000); with larger values\nof \u03b7 removing more gas from galaxies, curtailing star formation, and decreasing enrichment. These difference emphasize\nthe interplay of feedback, star formation, and energy deposition in the IGM.\nOur metallicity-density relationship is generally higher\nthan that inferred by S03 at most overdensities The primary\nreason for this discrepancy is the IGM temperature structure\nin our simulations. As we showed in \u00a74, our simulated IGM\nis continually growing hotter at lower redshift making the\nC iv ionization fraction smaller where the metals are, and\nhence requiring higher true metallicities to match a given\n\u03a9(C iv) absorption. To demonstrate this, the bottom panels\nof Figure 10 plot the overall C iv/C ratio (i.e. the inverse\nof the ionization correction) for all IGM gas independent of\n\nmetallicity as a function of overdensity for the various models, along with that derived from the density-temperature\nrelation assumed by S03 (the dashed line in Figure 8). C iv\nshould be primarily observed at overdensities where both\nthe metallicity and this ratio are large.\nThe S03 relation shows a much steeper ionization fraction growth with density in the mildly overdense regime than\nany of our simulations. This is because they assume pure\nphotoionization, whereas our models have significant contributions from collisionally ionized C iv. This is even true of\nour no-wind model, owing purely to the growth of structure\naround galaxies. This explains why S03 obtains a shallower\nmetallicity-density relation in this regime from C iv observations, while (as we will show in \u00a75) we match similar data\nwith our steeper metallicity-density gradient. Interestingly,\nScannapieco et al. (2006) suggested that a top-hat distribution of metals around galaxies is a better fit to the observed\nC iv auto-correlation function, as compared to the S03 fit.\n\n\f18\n\nB. D. Oppenheimer & R. Dav\u00e9\n\nOur simulations produce a distribution that at least comes\ncloser to this.\nFigure 10 is also helpful in visualizing some of the trends\ndescribed in \u00a74.2. First, the C iv/C ratio peak shifts from\noverdensities of about 1 to over 100 from z = 5.5 \u2192 2.0,\na startling increase due to the decreasing physical densities\nand (more weakly) the increasing ionizing background. The\noverdensities of the observed C iv do not shift as much because lower overdensities have less optical depth, plus the\ndiffuse IGM has few or no metals at high-z where the ratio is highest. Although the photo-ionized and collisionally\nionized regions are distinct in \u03c1 \u2212 T phase space, the ratio\nmerges into a single smooth peak when the temperature axis\nis collapsed (to visualize this look at the shading relative the\nthe IGM dashed mass contours in Figure 8). Also, the overall decrease in the C iv/C ratio toward low-z demonstrates\nthe decline in the ability to use C iv as a tracer of metals.\nThe differences between outflow models isolate the effect of feedback on the temperature structure of the entire\nIGM. At z = 5.5, feedback has not affected much the diffuse\nand underdense gas as can be seen by the similarity in the\nmodels; only the cw model is able to inject energy significantly to lower the ratio. During the Age of C iv at z = 3.5,\nthe ionization ratio is high at metal-rich overdensities high\nenough to create significant optical depth in all feedback\nmodels. The temperature structure causes the most divergence in the ratio by z = 2 because of the transition to collisionally ionized C iv, especially in the cw model. Our models clearly contrast with the S03 linear density-temperature\nrelationship, which intersects higher ionization fractions in\nthe photo-ionized regime (see Figure 8), leading to their estimates of lower metallicity.\nIn short, C iv ionization conditions evolve with density and redshift, with an increasing contribution from\ncollisionally-ionized absorbers at lower redshifts. Our metallicities at a given density are higher than inferred previously\nby S03 because the broad distribution of metals in the \u03c1 \u2212 T\nplane results in a higher overall C iv ionization correction.\n4.4\n\nEvolution of Median C iv Absorber in Phase\nSpace\n\nFigure 11 presents the evolution of absorbers in terms of the\nmedian phase space properties of C iv lines. We show three\nbins of column density (log(N (C iv)) = 12-13 (weak), 13-14\n(intermediate), 14-15 (strong)) over three different redshift\nranges (z = 6 \u2192 4.5, 4.5 \u2192 3, 3 \u2192 2), for three of our wind\nmodels (cw, mw, vzw). The values are obtained by summing\nover parcels of gas in redshift space (i.e. including peculiar\nvelocities and thermal broadening), and is thereby likely to\nunderestimate the density and metallicity of the parcel(s)\nof gas contributing most to the absorption within a given\nline. This is more true at lower redshift as C iv absorbers\nbecome compressed in comoving space while the comoving\npathlength per redshift increases. Nevertheless, these outflow models are clearly distinguished, allowing us to draw\nsome simple conclusions about the physics of the absorbers.\nIn the cw model, the median absorber exists at a temperature that is dominated by collisional ionization (\u2248 105\nK), which as we shall show produces poor agreement with\nobservations. The typical overdensity increases with time\nat all column densities, as diffuse gas becomes increasingly\n\nionized to C v and beyond. In contrast, the mw model's\nabsorbers are almost always photo-ionized except at the\nstrongest lines at high-z, and show relatively little evolution in overdensity over our redshift range, because the low\nwind speeds do not eject metals much outside the relatively\ndense regions that are well-traced by photo-ionized C iv.\nMeanwhile, the vzw model manages to shock heat more metals creating a larger collisionally ionized component, while\nconcurrently allowing significant metal enrichment of denser\nhalo gas by virtue of some outflow velocities being low.\nThis creates a wider range of overdensities and temperatures\ntraced by different column densities at any given redshift as\ncompared with either the cw or mw models, with weak absorbers tracing \u03c1/\u03c1\u0304 \u2248 4 \u2212 5, and strong absorbers tracing\n\u03c1/\u03c1\u0304 \u2248 30 \u2212 100.\nIn brief, the behavior of C iv absorption in cosmic phase\nspace shows noticeably different behavior for various wind\nmodels, suggesting that C iv observations can provide a sensitive probe of galactic outflows. In the next section, we\ndemonstrate this explicitly by comparing our outflow models\nto observations.\n\n5\n5.1\n\nTESTING OUTFLOW MODELS AGAINST\nOBSERVATIONS\nC iv Mass Density\n\nSo far we have seen that outflows can have a significant\nimpact on the physical properties of the IGM. We now compare C iv absorption line properties from our various outflow\nmodels in order to determine which ones, if any, successfully\nreproduce available observations. We begin by examining\nthe most global statistic that can be derived from C iv absorption, namely the total mass density in C iv absorbers,\n\u03a9(C iv).\n\u03a9(C iv) provides a benchmark observational test for\nmodels of IGM enrichment. The observed lack of evolution\nof \u03a9(C iv) from z \u2248 6 \u2192 2 has been cited as evidence for\nvery early (z & 6) enrichment of the IGM (Songaila 2001;\nScannapieco et al. 2002; Porciani & Madau 2005; Songaila\n2005) from a putative generation of early massive stars\nand/or primeval galaxies. Such a scenario is attractive at\nface value because winds can easily escape the small potential wells of early galaxies. But it should be remembered\nthat the metals must be expelled to densities approaching the cosmic mean in order not to have been gravitationally re-accreted onto galaxies by lower redshifts (e.g.\nPorciani & Madau 2005). This means winds must not only\nescape galaxies, but must also overcome Hubble flow which\nis quite rapid at these early times, approaching 1000 km/s. A\npopulation of early galaxies that is energetically able to expel winds at \u223c 1000 km/s may be difficult to reconcile with\nlimits on pre-reionization massive star formation from the\nlatest WMAP Thompson optical depth results (Page et al.\n2006).\nNone of our models directly test this early IGM enrichment scenario. Instead, our outflow models attempt to reproduce the observed C iv evolution self-consistently from standard stellar populations combined with locally-calibrated\noutflow models. We find that our models are successful,\nthereby removing the need for widespread early IGM en-\n\n\fSimulations of IGM Enrichment\n\n19\n\nFigure 11.

Left, middle and right panels show\nthe w16n256cw, w16n256mw, and w16n256vzw models. The medians plotted are derived from spectra that include peculiar velocities\nand thermal broadening. The cw model is dominated by collisionally-ionized absorbers at all redshifts, while mw is photo-ionization\ndominated. The vzw model probes the widest range of densities from weak to strong systems, showing its ability to enrich a wide range\nof environments, while still maintaining mostly photoionization-dominated temperatures.\n\nrichment. We further find that observations non-trivially\nconstrain our outflow models.\nSongaila (2001) determined \u03a9(C iv) by integrating the\ntotal column density of systems between 1012 6 N (C iv)<\n1015 cm\u22122 and dividing by the pathlength using\n\u03a9(CIV)(z) =\n\nH0 mCIV \u03a3Ntot (CIV, z)\nc\u03c1crit\n\u2206X(z)\n\n(5)\n\nwhere\n\u2206X(z) =\n\nZ\n\n(1 + z)2 dz\n\np\n\n\u03a9M (1 + z)3 + \u03a9\u039b\n\n.\n\n(6)\n\nThese limits are chosen because larger column density systems are likely to arise from galactic halo gas, while the lower\ncolumn densities suffer from observational incompleteness.\nWhen needed, we convert observations to our simulations'\n\u039bCDM cosmology (\u03a9M = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7). Measurements\nof \u03a9(C iv) have highlighted some interesting trends that already provide a key test for our various feedback models.\nFigure 12 shows the evolution of \u03a9(C iv), as well as\n\u03a9(C), calculated similarly to equation 5, except using the\ntotal metallicity along our simulated lines of sight. Observations of \u03a9(C iv) by Songaila (2001), Pettini et al. (2003),\nBokensberg, Sargent, & Rauch (2003), Songaila (2005),\nSimcoe (2006), and Ryan-Weber et al. (2006) are shown. We\nalso show a measurement at z \u223c 0 by Frye et al. (2003) for\nreference, although we will not compare to this data here.\nThe first striking result from this plot is that while the\ntrue IGM metallicity continually grows from z = 6 \u2192 1.5,\nmost wind models show \u03a9(C iv) to be relatively constant,\nand perhaps even decreasing at the lowest redshifts. This\nis especially true for our stronger wind models (cw, mzw,\nzw), indicating that outflows play a key role in governing\n\nC iv evolution. The key point is that in our models, \u03a9(C iv)\nevolution is not a true indicator of metallicity evolution.\nTwo counteracting effects conspire to make \u03a9(C iv) appear nearly constant. All feedback models grow IGM metallicity at a similar rate, but in the stronger wind models this is\noffset by a decreasing C iv ionization fraction owing mainly\nto an increasing IGM temperature from feedback energy. In\nthe case where the feedback energy is minimal such as in\nthe mw model, the globally-averaged ionization correction\n(shown in the bottom panel) remains more constant. Nevertheless, even this model's ionization correction increases\nbeyond z = 3 as physical densities of the IGM decrease and\nthe ionization background reaches its maximum strength.\nHowever, for feedback models that heat the IGM significantly (cw,zw,mzw), the ionization correction from C iv to\n[C/H] increases significantly with time, resulting a fairly flat\n\u03a9(C iv) from z = 5 \u2192 2 despite nearly an order of magnitude increase in \u03a9(C).\nIntermediate wind-speed models, mzw and vzw, provide the best fit to observations of \u03a9(C iv) over this redshift range. Recall that these are both momentum-driven\nwind models where fL,\u2299 = 2 and fL,\u2299 = 1.05 \u2212 2, respectively. Indeed, the vzw model reproduces the most recent\nSuperPOD analysis by Songaila (2005, open circles) almost\nexactly, though without a more careful comparison to data\nthis should not be taken too seriously. Interestingly, vzw\nand mzw provide good fits to \u03a9(C iv) evolution for somewhat different reasons. In the mzw model substantial IGM\nenrichment is accompanied by significant heat input, so that\nionization corrections evolves rapidly to maintain a roughly\nconstant \u03a9(C iv). In the vzw model, there is less IGM enrichment owing to lower wind velocities, but also less heat\ninput. Indeed, mzw and vzw seem to bracket the allowed\nrange of heat/energy input combinations: cw and zw pro-\n\n\f20\n\nB. D. Oppenheimer & R. Dav\u00e9\n\nFigure 12. Evolution of \u03a9(C iv) (closed circles) and \u03a9(C) (open\ncircles), the mass density in C iv and metals, respectively. Our\nfive feedback models are compared to observations from Songaila\n(2001) (black circles), Pettini et al. (2003) (small filled black\nsquares), Bokensberg, Sargent, & Rauch (2003) (open triangles),\nFrye et al. (2003) (open square), Songaila (2005) (large open\ndots), Simcoe (2006) (large black squares), and Ryan-Weber et al.\n(2006) (black triangle is a lower limit). All models show an increasing \u03a9(C) over this redshift range, but most show a relatively\nconstant \u03a9(C iv). The ratio is shown as a \"global ionization correction\" in the bottom panel. The cw model is the most metal\nrich, and has increasingly large ionization corrections toward low\nredshift as the IGM is significantly heated and metals are pushed\npredominantly into low density regions. The weak momentum\nwind model (mw) produces little evolution in the ionization correction because it does not heat the IGM significantly, and hence\nis the only model that shows a rising \u03a9(C iv) over the entire redshift range. The zw model overproduces \u03a9(C iv) because it produces too many metals overall. The mzw and vzw models provide\ngood fits to the observations, with the greatest discrimination between the two occurring at the highest redshifts. If further observations can confirm the lack of a downturn at z > 5, 5, another\nmechanism for early enrichment may be required.\n\nduce too many metals in the IGM, while mw provides too\nlittle heat to obtain an ionization correction that grow sufficiently from z = 6 \u2192 1.5. Hence even from a relatively\nblunt tool such as \u03a9(C iv), it is possible to place interesting\nconstraints on outflow models.\nTo further constrain models using \u03a9(C iv) requires\nprobing to lower and higher redshifts. Lower redshift C iv\nobservations should in principle be able to break this model\ndegeneracy, but may be difficult to interpret because C iv\ntraces increasingly denser regions that may be subject to\nmulti-phase collapse, and the photoionizing background is\n\nmore poorly constrained. Additionally, there is the observational challenge of C iv moving into the ultraviolet. Nevertheless, the determination of \u03a9(C iv) in the local universe by\nFrye et al. (2003) would appear to favor a model with lower\nionization corrections, since the IGM metallicity should level\noff because of the rapidly dropping global star formation rate\nat z . 1.5. We leave comparisons to z < 1.5 data for future\nwork.\nConversely, moving to higher redshifts may provide\nmore robust constraints. In particular, new observations by\nSimcoe (2006) and Ryan-Weber et al. (2006) at z > 5.5 continue to show no apparent drop in \u03a9(C iv) while our models\npredict a gradual decline. These measurements are dominated by a few strong systems (as these are the only ones\ndetectable with current technology), so it is possible that\nmay be associated with recent outflows that do not occupy\na significant volume rather than indicative of widespread enrichment. Upcoming near infrared spectra of high-z quasars\ndiscovered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey should confirm\njust how widespread the C iv is, and whether our models require a further enrichment mechanism at high-z or perhaps\nan increase in yields from the earliest stars. The lack of\nstrong C iv observed above z > 5.90 by Simcoe (2006) along\nwith the observation of a sudden increase in O i Becker et al.\n(2006) at z > 6 may mean a sudden change in the ionization\nconditions of metals at this epoch corresponding to the last\nstages of reionization Fan et al. (2006) (R. Simcoe, private\ncommunication).\nFinally, we examine a potential source of systematic uncertainty in comparing models to observations of \u03a9(C iv),\nnamely the effects of Helium reionization. The epoch and\nduration of He ii reionization is controversial, with some observations suggesting a rapid transition (Songaila & Cowie\n1996; Schaye et al. 2000; Theuns et al. 2002a; Zheng et al.\n2004) at z \u223c 3, while others favoring a more gradual evolution before z = 3 (Dav\u00e9 et al. 1998; Sokasian et al. 2003).\nAlthough the ionization potential of C iv is around 3.5 Ryd\nwhile He ii is optically thick above 4 Ryd, there may still\nbe some residual effect on C iv absorption. To test this, we\ngenerate spectra using a soft QG ionizing background where\nwe have reduced the photoionizing flux above 4 Ry by \u00d710,\nand derive the resulting \u03a9(C iv) evolution.\nFigure 13 shows the results for the vzw case; the trends\nare similar for other outflow models. C iv traces less overdense material especially between \u03c1/\u03c1\u0304 = 1 \u2212 10, because of\nthe lack of photons capable of ionizing C iv into C v; thus\ndecreasing the overall C iv ionization correction. Hence if\nHe ii reionization is a sudden process, there should a sudden decrease in \u03a9(C iv) by a factor of around two at the\nepoch. Such a drop is not obvious in the data, although\nerror bars are large and could conceivably hide it. At face\nvalue, it instead appears that He ii reionization is a gradual\nprocess, which could also somewhat affect the evolution of\n\u03a9(C iv) possibly making this measurement even more constant over the redshift range. In fact, ( (2006)) find evidence\nthat the fluctuations in the He ii/H i ratio require a patchy\nbackground at energies > 4 Ryd between z = 2 \u2212 3. We plan\nto examine the effects of this in more detail in the future.\nTo summarize, our models indicate that the invariance\nin \u03a9(C iv) at 2 . z . 5 does not require the majority of IGM\nenrichment to occur at z > 5. Our favored feedback simulations prefer an interpretation where metals injection fol-\n\n\fSimulations of IGM Enrichment\n\nFigure 13. The comparison of the evolution of \u03a9(C iv) with the\nstandard Haardt & Madau (2001) ionization background (solid)\nand a softer ionization background where we have reduced the\nionization at > 4 Ryd by 90% to simulate pre-He ii reionization\nconditions above z = 3 (dotted). The same data points described\nin Figure 12 are displayed. The soft background increases the\nobserved C iv by as much as a factor of two. This difference favors\na gradual He ii reionization, as a sudden transition would produce\nan observable drop in C iv.\n\nlows global stellar mass production, but the accompanying\nenergy injection conspires to make \u03a9(C iv) roughly constant\nover the observed redshift range. We cannot rule out an early\nenrichment scenario that invokes a speculative early generation of stars to distribute metals in a manner that matches\n\u03a9(C iv) data, but our self-consistent outflow models provide\na more straightforward explanation.\n5.2\n5.2.1\n\nC iv Line Parameters\nC iv Column Density Distributions\n\nWhile we showed that \u03a9(C iv) can provide interesting constraints on outflow models, in fact there is more information\ncontained in the statistical properties of C iv absorption systems from which \u03a9(C iv) is derived. In this section we compare our models to observations of the column density distribution (CDD), which is the number of lines per unit redshift\ninterval per log column density bin. The CDD is observed\nto fairly accurately follow a steep power law (Ellison et al.\n2000; Songaila 2001). The slope, amplitude, and any deviations from this power law provide key diagnostics for testing\nmodels of IGM enrichment.\nWe use the AutoVP package (Dav\u00e9 et al. 1997) to fit\n30 simulated spectra per run generated continuously from\nz = 6 \u2192 1.5. For now we only consider the 1548 \u00c5 C iv component to avoid confusion; in real spectra, the sparseness of\nC iv absorption generally results in little ambiguity in line\nidentification and characterization. This sparseness also provides a robust determination of the quasar continuum, so we\ndo not continuum-fit our C iv spectra. Theuns et al. (2000)\ndemonstrated that AutoVP provided nearly identical fits to\nlines as the standard fitting package VPFIT (Carswell et al.\n1987) for non-saturated lines (as is virtually always the case\nfor C iv), and the quality of the fits in the figure appears\n\n21\n\ngood even in complex systems. One technical difference in\nfitting simulated spectra is that here we fit only the stronger\ncomponent of the doublet, while observations generally require the presence of both doublet components to unambiguously identify C iv. Because of this, observations are more\nlikely to miss weak lines. This difference is negligible when\nwe integrate the total metal mass, but can become significant when we discuss the small-N (C iv) end of the CDD.\nTo compare our models with observations, we take line\nlists from 9 high-resolution spectra taken with HIRES published by Bokensberg, Sargent, & Rauch (2003) (hereafter\nBSR03). The BSR03 data have typical signal-to-noise ratios\nof S/N \u223c 100 and span z = 1.6 \u2192 4.5. We subdivide the\nBSR03 dataset into systems with z > 3 and z < 3, which\ncovers a total of 9.19 and 7.73 in C iv redshift path length,\nrespectively. We have also compared with line lists from 19\nVLT/UVES spectra kindly provided to us by E. Scannapieco (Scannapieco et al. 2006), which covers a path length\nof 25.12 from z = 1.5 \u2212 3.0 with lower signal-to-noise than\nBSR03. However, the results are similar to BSR03, and the\nlower S/N and smaller redshift range motivates us to focus on the BSR03 data for clarity. In the future we hope\nto obtain the spectra themselves in order to do more careful\ncomparisons including detailed noise characteristics and resolution effects (e.g. Dav\u00e9 & Tripp 2001), but for now these\ndata will suffice in order to ascertain the basic trends versus\nour various wind models.\nFigure 14 plots CDDs for systems of C iv absorbers in\nthree redshift bins, z = 1.5 \u2212 3.0, 3.0 \u2212 4.5, 4.5 \u2212 6.0. We will\nrefer to these as the low, intermediate, and high redshift\nbins, respectively, throughout this paper (though we recognize that z = 1.5\u22123 is not often regarded as \"low\" redshift).\nFor simplicity we omit the zw and nw models from discussion, because the relevant trends are well-illustrated by the\nother four models (cw, mzw, vzw, and mw). Also shown are\nthe BSR03 data (black triangles) in the relevant redshift\nranges.\nAs can be seen, all the simulations generally produce a\npower law between 1012.5 . N (C iv). 1014.5 whose shape\nis in agreement with observations. In fact, at early times\nthe simulations show more of a deviation from a power law\nin the sense of fewer weak lines, because the enrichment\nhas not spread yet to very low densities; such a trend is\nvaguely noticeable in the data as well. At the very lowest\ncolumn densities the effects of incompleteness become significant. For concreteness, here are our completeness limits\nfrom simulated spectra with S/N = 100: 75% for 1012.00 <\nN (C iv)< 1012.25 , 88% for 1012.25 < N (C iv)< 1012.50 , and\n97% for 1012.50 < N (C iv)< 1012.75 . BSR03's completeness\nlimits are probably similar but somewhat lower given their\nrequirement of identifying the weaker doublet line. As we are\nlooking to understand general physical trends rather than\nengage in a detailed comparison versus observations, we do\nnot attempt to mimic the data in any greater level of detail. We simply note that if a simulated CDD exceeds the\ndata at the small N (C iv) end, one cannot draw conclusions\nfrom this without more carefully analyzing the incompleteness level in the data.\nWhile qualitatively similar, these four wind models do\nshow statistically significant differences, indeed quite large\nones. The difference in CDD amplitude (and its evolution)\ntells basically the same story as the evolution of \u03a9(C iv):\n\n\f22\n\nB. D. Oppenheimer & R. Dav\u00e9\n\nFigure 14. C iv Column density distributions for four of our outflow models in three redshift bins, compared to observations by BSR03\n(black triangles). The cw model clearly overpredicts the CDD, while the mw predicts too few weak systems showing that its winds are\ntoo weak to enrich the low-density IGM. The mzw and vzw model provide promising fits to the data; the overprediction at weak column\ndensities is likely a result of lower S/N in the BSR03 data.\n\ncw produces too much C iv, while mw produces quite little,\nparticularly early on. But the decomposition into column\ndensity bins provides additional information. For instance,\nthe mw model does not enrich the low-density IGM much\nowing to its small wind speeds, and hence cannot produce\nenough weak lines at z = 3\u22124.5 to agree with data. We note\nthat the incompleteness in the observations is likely greater\nthan that in the simulated spectra, so this effect works in the\nwrong direction to reconcile the mw model CDD. So even\nthough mw looked promising at early times in the \u03a9(C iv)\ncomparison, it actually fails significantly when examining\nCDDs. In contrast, the mzw and vzw models provides very\ngood agreement with observations, with the only discrepancies at N (C iv). 1012.5 which may be explained by larger\nincompleteness in the observations.\nMoving to the low redshift bin, model CDDs draw closer\nfor two reasons. First, C iv traces denser gas where metals have been injected earlier on, and second because the\nmetallicity in the denser regions starts to saturate, reaching an equilibrium between galaxies producing new metals\nand outflows driving those metals to lower densities. Again,\nthere are still non-trivial differences, as cw still overproduces\nC iv absorption at all column densities, and mw still produces fewer weak lines. At face value the mw model seems to\nmatch the weak lines best, but recall that additional incompleteness in the data is quite significant here (particularly\nsince the BSR03 observations with HIRES are less sensitive\nin the blue), so the turnover in the data at N (C iv)< 1013\nmay be at least partly artificial. There is a hint that all\nmodels produce too few of the very strongest systems with\nN (C iv)> 1014.5 , which may be due to an increasing population of C iv absorbing gas in small, cold clumps that our simulations cannot resolve. For instance, Simcoe et al. (2006)\nderive small thicknesses (< 1 kpc) and high overdensities\n(\u03c1/\u03c1\u0304 > 100) for many of their strongest C iv components,\nwhich is below our spatial resolution limit.\n\nOverall, the C iv CDD provides a sensitive test of the\nmanner in which outflow models push metals into the IGM.\nComparisons to observed C iv column density distributions\nfavor the vzw and mzw models, which shows little redshift\nevolution at all but the smallest column densities, and whose\ntotal C iv absorption is close to that observed. More generally, it demonstrates that outflows must have wind speeds\nlarge enough to enrich the very diffuse IGM (giving rise to\nweak C iv absorption) at early times, but must not be so\nstrong as to overproduce C iv absorption overall.\n\n5.2.2\n\nC iv Linewidths\n\nWhile column density distributions probe the spatial distribution C iv in the IGM, line widths are more directly related\nto the temperature and dynamics of the absorbing gas. For\nH i, the line widths at z & 2 are dominated by Hubble flow\nbroadening (e.g. Hernquist et al. 1996), i.e. the cosmic expansion velocity spread across an unbound absorbing structure. This becomes less true at lower redshifts, where H i\nline widths obtain an increasing contribution from thermal\nbroadening (Dav\u00e9 & Tripp 2001), mainly because they arise\nin higher overdensity structures that do not have substantial\nHubble flow across them (Dav\u00e9 et al. 1999). In the case of\nC iv, even at high redshifts they arise in fairly overdense regions (see Figure 9), so we can expect that their line widths\nwould have a significant contribution from thermal broadening.\nFigure 15 shows histograms of b-parameters (i.e. Voigt\nprofile line widths) of components with 1013 < N (C iv)<\n1014 cm\u22122 in four of our outflow models for our three redshift bins, compared with BSR03 observations (filled circles\nin the lower two redshift bins). This column density range is\noptimal because observations both yield a statistically significant number of lines and generally approach 100% com-\n\n\fSimulations of IGM Enrichment\n\n23\n\nFigure 15. Line width (b-parameter) distributions for 1013 < N (C iv)< 1014 cm\u22122 systems for our various outflow simulations compared\nto observations by BSR03 (black dots). The arrows at the bottom show to the median values of the distribution for each model, and the\ntop arrow is the median of the BSR03 data. The data agree with the mzw model at intermediate redshift, but suggest more compact,\ncooler C iv absorbers at low redshift such as those in the vzw or mw model.\n\npleteness. Arrows at the bottom of the plot show the median\nvalues.\nThe trends in this plot follow those in Figure 5, middle right panel (which showed the mean temperature evolution of the IGM). The cw model has significantly larger\nb-parameters owing to substantial shock heat input from\noutflows, and appears to be clearly discrepant when compared to observations. Indeed, the cw model actually has\nmore lines (\u223c 66%) at z > 4.5 that arise from collisional\nionized C iv (T & 105 K, bthermal > 11.8 km s\u22121 ) than\nat z < 4.5 where C iv is photoionized in cooler gas; this\npartly explains the bmed evolution downward. Observations\nfrom BSR03 (solid points) suggest the mzw model is the\nbest fit at intermediate redshift, while the vzw model better\napproximates the low-z absorbers. The momentum-driven\nwind models (mw, mzw, vzw) are remarkable in that bmed\ndoes not vary by more than 1 km s\u22121 from z = 6 \u2192 1.5, especially considering that one of the main points of this paper\nis that C iv absorbers show significant physical evolution.\nAs an informative exercise, we subdivide the width of\nthe vzw model line into a thermal component, bth , that\ndepends only on temperature, and a spatial component,\nbsp , due to Hubble expansion across the physical extent\nof the absorber. We ignore turbulent broadening since the\nIGM at these overdensities is very quiescent\np (Rauch et al.\n2005). Specifically, we assign btot =\nb2th + b2sp , where\np\n4\nbth = 3.7 T /10 for carbon, and bsp = H(z) w(C iv) where\nw(C iv) is the spatial extent of the C iv. Figure 16 shows the\ntotal (solid) and thermal (dashed) b-parameter histograms\nfor the vzw model, with bth calculated from the temperatures at the line centers. The thermal widths are the most\nsignificant component of the total line width, especially at\nlow redshift, demonstrating (as expected) that at the moderate overdensities of C iv absorbers the Hubble broadening\nis sub-dominant. This implies that b-parameters can effectively trace the IGM temperature in C iv absorbing gas.\n\nIn summary, the line width distributions and the lowcolumn density end of the CDD together put significant constraints on the wind speeds of early outflows: They must be\nstrong enough to pollute the diffuse IGM at early times, but\nweak enough so as not to overheat the IGM. Some heating is\naccommodated, and in fact during the Age of C iv there is a\nhint that without wind heating, line widths are too narrow.\nMore careful comparisons will be necessary to place more\ndetailed constraints, but the fact that our locally-calibrated\nmomentum-driven wind scenarios naturally fall within these\nrelatively tight constraints represents a significant success\nfor these models.\n5.3\n\nPixel Optical Depth Statistics\n\nThe pixel optical depth (POD) method provides a powerful\nway to measure the metallicity in the diffuse IGM across\na wide range of densities. The idea is to directly utilize\noptical depth information in the spectrum rather than fit\nlines, so that even weak absorption that would not yield\na statistically significant line identification can be quantified. Songaila (1998) pioneered this approach, which was\nalso used by Dav\u00e9 et al. (1998) to quantify O vi absorption in the crowded high-redshift Ly-\u03b1 forest. More recently,\nAguirre et al. (2005) and Songaila (2005) have expanded on\nPOD analyses to precisely quantify C iv absorption in the\nIGM. In this section we compare POD analyses of simulated\nspectra with such observations.\nIn POD analyses, a histograms of optical depth ratios\nof two ions is constructed. This is done by identifying significant absorption in one ion, and examining the location in\nthe spectrum where the other ion should be, and inferring\nthe optical depth ratio of the latter to the former. In our\ncase, we will consider C iv/H i and C iii/C iv ratios, in order\nto compare with data from Aguirre et al. (2005). Since C iii\nhas a rest wavelength of 977\u00c5, we must also correct for coincident absorption from H i Lyman series lines; we apply the\n\n\f24\n\nB. D. Oppenheimer & R. Dav\u00e9\n\nFigure 16. Histograms of total linewidth (solid lines) for the vzw model and thermal linewidth (bth ) derived from the temperature\nof the C iv absorbing gas (dashed lines). Thermal broadening comprises the majority of the total linewidth, especially at low redshift,\nshowing that the b-parameter distribution can provide a sensitive test of feedback energy input into the IGM.\n\nmethod detailed by Aguirre et al. (2002) to do so. Specifically, the lowest order unsaturated Lyman-series line is used\nto determine the H i optical depth, which is then subtracted\nfrom all Lyman lines leaving the absorption component of\nany metal lines. Higher-order Ly\u03b1 lines with their lower oscillator strengths allow one to probe much higher H i, up to\n\u03c4 (H i)> 1000 as opposed to \u03c4 (H i)\u223c 3 using Ly\u03b1 alone. The\nPOD method is surprisingly effective at extracting metal\nlines in the Lyman forest, although the effectiveness declines\nat z > 4 due to the thick Ly\u03b1 forest. While the full POD\nhistograms are rich in information, for brevity here we focus\non the median of the optical depth ratios as a function of\nH i or C iv optical depth.\nWe apply the POD method to the 30 lines-of-sight\nextracted from each simulation, where we include all 25\nions and continuum-fit the spectra blueward of Ly\u03b1 as described in \u00a72.6. We compare our results with POD statistics\nfrom Aguirre et al. (2005) for a sample of 6 quasars with\n< z >\u2248 3.1.\n\n5.3.1\n\nC iv/H i POD Statistics\n\nFigure 17 (top panels) shows the median C iv/H i ratio as a\nfunction of H i optical depth for a variety of redshift ranges,\nfor the cw, mw, mzw, and vzw models (left to right). This\nPOD statistic shows even more dramatic differences between\nthe various feedback models than the CDDs. For comparison, we plot the data from Aguirre et al. (2005) in the\nz = 2.8 \u2212 3.4 panels.\nThe overall trend is that the median POD ratio rises\nwith time. This is primarily because the H i optical depth\nat a given overdensity is dropping more rapidly with time\nthan the C iv optical depth because as the universe becomes\nless dense H i becomes more ionized, while C iv ionizing to\nC v is offset somewhat by C iii ionizing up to C iv. However,\na secondary non-trivial effect is that the IGM is becoming\nincreasingly enriched. While the median POD ratio is rel-\n\natively flat with H i optical depth, the peak does shift to\nlower H i optical depth with time, owing to winds pushing\nmetals further out into the IGM.\nComparing to observations, it is clear that the cw model\noverpredicts the median POD ratio at z \u2248 3.1, consistent\nwith over-enrichment of the IGM as has been seen from the\n\u03a9(C iv) and CDD comparisons. What is new here is that the\nshape of the curve is also discrepant, in that the peak value\nis produced around log \u03c4 (H i)\u223c 1, while observations prefer\na peak at log \u03c4 (H i)\u223c 1.5. This is indicating that metals are\ntoo widely distributed in the cw model, in addition to being\noverproduced.\nThe mw model represents the other extreme, where it\nfits only the high density regions (log \u03c4 (H i)& 2) but does not\ndistribute the metals widely enough to match at log \u03c4 (H i).\n1.5. Clearly, the winds are too weak in this model to enrich\nthe diffuse IGM.\nIn contrast, the mzw does and excellent job fitting the\nfull range of H i optical depths, indicating the winds are both\nproducing the correct amount of C iv as well as distributing\nit correctly versus the underlying H i absorption. The vzw\nmodel is nearly as good, although it appears to produce\nslightly too little C iv absorption overall. Without doing a\nmore careful comparison, we can only say that both these\nmodels are in reasonable agreement with observations.\nAguirre et al. (2005) applied the POD method on simulations including a 10 h\u22121 Mpc, 2 \u00d7 2163 particle Gadget2 simulation from SH03 (the Q4 simulation) with the cw\nfeedback model, but without metal-line cooling. They added\nan ad hoc cooling method wherein SPH particles with cooling times less than Hubble times instantaneously reach\nT \u223c 104 K; resulting in a C iv/H i ratio increasing by about\n\u223c \u00d710 with cooling. Using a test simulation, an 8 h\u22121 Mpc\nbox vzw simulation with 2\u00d71283 particles with and without\nmetal-line cooling, we find the metal-line cooling increases\nC iv absorption only by between 60-90%, likely because in\nthe denser regions the IGM is continuously reheated by feedback, while in the underdense regions the cooling time even\n\n\fSimulations of IGM Enrichment\n\n25\n\nFigure 17. Median pixel optical depth ratios for our outflow models in three redshift bins, compared to observations by Aguirre et al.\n(2005) (solid lines). The mzw model provides the best fit to the observed C iv/H i ratio where H i is a proxy for overdensity, indicating\nthat the metals are properly spatially distributed in this model. The vzw model does nearly as well, while the cw model injects far too\nmany metals and the mw model is only able to enrich the most overdense regions. The vzw and mw models adequately fit the C iii/C iv\nratio while the cw and mzw models underestimate this ratio due to excessive heating of the IGM. The mismatch at \u03c4 (C iii)\u223c \u22120.1 is\nlikely a result of our simulated spectra having lower S/N than the observations resulting in worse Lyman series subtraction at high\noptical depths in the C iii forest. The C iv/H i ratio grows toward lower redshift due to increasing metal enrichment, while the C iii/C iv\ndecreases due to heating of the IGM and decreasing physical densities.\n\nwith metals approaches the Hubble time. Hence the additional effects of metal line cooling cannot reconcile the cw\nmodel with observations.\n\n5.3.2\n\nC iii/C iv Statistics\n\nThe C iii/C iv POD relation is used by S03 to provide a\nconstraint on the temperature of the absorbing C iv. This\nis a difficult measurement to obtain since C iii (977\u00c5) is\nburied in the Ly\u03b2 forest, but their method applied identically to observations and simulations shows that the ratio\ncan still be instructive. They conclude that the high ratios\n(\u03c4 (C iii)/\u03c4 (C iv)> 3 at z > 3) rule out large fractions of\nC iv-absorbing gas at T > 105 K where collisional ionization\ndominates and the ratio drops precipitously (refer to their\nFigure 7 to see how this ratio depends on density and tem-\n\nperature using the QG background). Aguirre et al. (2005)\nfind that their Gadget-2 simulation remained much too\nhot to reproduce the observed ratio, and ratios were 0.65\ndex too low even when including metal cooling, only a modest improvement.\nWe find that our cw model indeed produces too low a\nmedian POD ratio. This indicates that the IGM is too hot\nin this model compared with observations, as we also saw\nin the b-parameter comparison. In contrast, our momentumwind models fare considerably better. The mzw model still\nappears to heat the IGM too much, but the vzw and mw\nmodels (with relatively low wind speeds that do not add\nmuch heat to the IGM) fare quite well.\nS03 points out that the observed C iii/C iv ratios are inconsistent with the absorbing gas being at T & 105 K. However, even the vzw and mw models have a substantial fraction of their C iv-absorbing gas collisionally ionized, about\n\n\f26\n\nB. D. Oppenheimer & R. Dav\u00e9\n\n30% at z \u223c 3. Despite this, these models match the POD ratios quite well, showing that some collisionally-ionized C iv\nis still accommodated by observations.\nS03 further observes a gradual decline in\n\u03c4 (C iii)/\u03c4 (C iv) with time. All wind models produce a\ngradual decline qualitatively consistent with these data.\nIn photo-ionized gas this decline is mainly driven by\nHubble expansion increasing the IGM ionization level, and\nsecondarily by the increasing temperature of the IGM.\nIn summary, pixel optical depth techniques provide a\ncomplementary technique to Voigt profile fitting for examining IGM C iv absorption. The overall results from both\nof these techniques support the same basic conclusions: Our\ncw model overproduces metals, distributes them too widely,\nand makes the IGM too hot, while the mw model underproduces metals, does not distribute them widely enough,\nand keeps the IGM (possibly) too cool. In between lie the\nmzw and vzw models that seem to span the allowed range\nof metal and energy input. More generally, these observations already provide a non-trivial bracketing of the allowed\nenergy and metal input into the IGM as a function of redshift. More careful comparisons with observations, particularly pushing to higher and lower redshifts, should allow us\nto provide strong constraints on the properties of galactic\noutflows across cosmic time.\n\n6\n\nNUMERICAL RESOLUTION\n\nNumerical simulations by necessity have a finite dynamic\nrange, and even advanced ones such as ours cannot fully\nresolve the relevant scales from star formation to the Hubble volume. Hence we must ensure that our results are not\nsensitive to issues of numerical resolution. For this purpose\nwe have run with 8, 16 and 32 h\u22121 Mpc box lengths, as described in \u00a72, which span a factor of 4 in spatial resolution\nand a factor of 64 in mass resolution . The results presented\nso far have been derived from the 16h\u22121 Mpc volumes for\neach outflow model, because as we will show in this section,\ntheir results show good convergence relative to the higherresolution 8h\u22121 Mpc runs (at least for the momentum-driven\nwind models), but the 32h\u22121 Mpc runs do not show good\nconvergence. We present simple arguments that explain this\nbehavior in terms of the Jeans length in the moderatelyoverdense IGM giving rise to C iv absorption. Finally, we\nshow that the constant wind model shows poor convergence\nat all resolutions. We focus on the convergence properties\nof the observable quantities that we have compared to in\nprevious sections.\nIn Figure 18 we show \u03a9(C iv) and \u03a9(C) (or more accurately the carbon in the IGM) for the cw (top) and vzw\n(bottom) models. The cw model shows poor convergence,\nwith more metals and C iv absorption being produced in\nhigher resolution simulations. This is in stark contrast with\nthe global star formation rate in these models, which shows\nexcellent convergence at late times as demonstrated by SH03\n(higher-resolution simulations do resolve earlier star formation). In the cw model, all galaxies roughly enrich the same\nvolume independent of galaxy mass since they eject winds\nat the same speed. Hence higher resolution simulations that\nresolve star formation in smaller halos at earlier times distribute metals much more widely. To obtain a convergent\n\nFigure 18. The numerical resolution dependence of \u03a9(C) (as\nmeasured along our lines of sight) and \u03a9(C iv) in the cw and vzw\nmodels in the 8, 16, and 32 h\u22121 Mpc boxes with 2563 gas and\ndark particles. The same data points described in Figure 12 are\ndisplayed. \u03a9(C) and \u03a9(C iv) converge quite well in momentumdriven wind models, unlike for the constant wind case. The\n\u03a9(C iv) measurement suggests slightly larger ionization corrections at lower redshift in larger boxes.\n\nIGM enrichment in a constant wind model requires resolving every galaxy that has ever driven a wind, which is exceptionally challenging computationally. Since the disagreement\nwith observations is even greater in higher resolution runs,\nthis model is unlikely to be successful in explaining IGM\nenrichment.\nThe vzw model, on the other hand, shows much better\nresolution convergence over most of the redshift range in\nboth \u03a9(C iv) and \u03a9(C), with a minor exception at z & 5\nwhere the stochastic nature of biased early star formation\nmay be producing differences between the realizations.\nThe impact of a finite volume is also seen in the vzw\nmodel at z . 3. Here, the 32h\u22121 Mpc volume produces a\nlarger global C iv ionization correction, owing to larger and\nhotter structure being formed in the larger volume. The\ndifferences are small, but illustrate that large volumes are\nneeded as well as high resolution in order to properly model\n\n\fSimulations of IGM Enrichment\nthe IGM. Hence it is desirable to use the largest possible\nvolume that is resolution-converged.\nDespite these minor issues, our overall conclusions\nshould be robust as long as the simulations are capable of\naccurately resolving the properties of C iv absorbers. As Figure 19 shows, this is a good assumption for the CDD, with\nthe 8 and 16h\u22121 Mpc vzw volumes showing good convergence\nover most of the redshift range. The other momentum-driven\nwinds follow similar trends, while cw is not converged (as\nwith \u03a9(C iv); not shown). The deviations in the vzw case are\nprimarily associated with the 32h\u22121 Mpc volume. It underestimates weak absorbers at high-z because it cannot fully\nresolve all metal production, and it underestimates strong\nabsorbers at low-z because strong C iv systems arise in small\ngalactic halos that it cannot resolve. Hence our 16 h\u22121 Mpc\nvolume is optimal. Unfortunately, we cannot directly determine if our 16 h\u22121 Mpc volume is robust at z < 3, since we\nhave only evolved our 8 h\u22121 Mpc volume to z = 3 due to\nCPU time considerations. Some effects of multi-phase collapse in high density regions may therefore persist in this\nvolume, which may explain the deficit present in all models\ncompared to data at the largest column densities.\nThe linewidths provide an even more stringent test of\nresolution, because they are keenly sensitive to small fluctuations in diffuse gas. Figure 20 shows the b-parameter distribution for the vzw model in three redshift intervals. While\nthe 8 and 16h\u22121 Mpc agree very well, the w32n256vzw model\nclearly shows wider b-parameters at all redshifts. If we split\nthe width of the lines up into their thermal and spatial component as we did in \u00a75.2.2, we find that the increase is mostly\nin bsp . At z > 4.5, we find w(C iv)= 12.7, 11.5, and 16.5 kpc\nfor the 8, 16, and 32 h\u22121 Mpc boxes respectively. Hence the\nline widths, as with the CDDs, are well converged up to\n16h\u22121 Mpc but falter at lower resolution.\nCan we understand why the 16 h\u22121 Mpc volumes are\nconverged but 32 h\u22121 Mpc ones are not? To do so, we estimate the minimum spatial resolution needed to properly\nmodel IGM fluctuations at any given density. We begin\nwith the minimum SPH resolution, which is approximately\n0.5 lbox /npart \u00d7 (\u03c1/\u03c1\u0304)\u22121/3 , or 0.5 d \u0304mis (\u03c1/\u03c1\u0304)\u22121/3 where d \u0304mis\nis the mean interparticle spacing (i.e. a single resolution element generally requires two SPH particles in any given direction). The physical minimum optically-thin absorber size\ndepends on the Jeans length, the limit below which the thermal kinetic energy prevents\np the IGM from collapsing. The\nJeans length is rj = 975 T4 /[(\u03c1/\u03c1\u0304)(1 + z)3 ] kpc at a given\ndensity \u03c1, where T4 = T /104 . Equating the minimum SPH\nresolution to rj , we derive the following expression for the\nmaximum interparticle spacing allowable in a simulation to\nresolve an absorber,\n\u221a\ndres = 170 (\u03c1/\u03c1\u0304)\u22121/6 (4/(1 + z))\u22123/2 T4 h\u22121 kpc.\n(7)\nBecause of the inverse density dependence in dres , SPH\nsimulations actually tend to resolve the low-density IGM\nfluctuations slightly better than the high-density ones, at a\ngiven temperature. However, particularly at high redshifts,\nlow-density fluctuations tend to be colder (see Figure 11),\nmaking them the dominant resolution constraint. The typical value of 170 h\u22121 kpc above is uncomfortably close to our\n32 h\u22121 Mpc volume's d \u0304mis = 125h\u22121 kpc, hence this volume\nis starting to fail to resolve some absorbers, resulting in poor\nconvergence.\n\n27\n\nAt low-z, Simcoe et al. (2006) observed strong metalline absorbers to have T \u223c 104 K and \u03c1/\u03c1\u0304 \u223c 100 between\nz = 2.7 \u2192 1.8. These are similar to the physical parameters\nof our strongest C iv systems at these redshifts. At z = 2, we\nobtain d \u0304res = 51h\u22121 kpc for these parameters, which would\nnot quite be resolved even in our 16 h\u22121 Mpc runs (d \u0304mis =\n63h\u22121 kpc). Hence the deficit in strong systems in our models\nmay be due to lack of resolution.\nTo summarize, the resolution convergence for the vzw\nmodel is quite good up to our 16h\u22121 Mpc volume, which is\nprecisely why we chose to quote predictions for this volume\nthroughout the paper. Our 32h\u22121 Mpc shows poorer convergence, but it also suggests that at lower redshifts (z . 3)\nthe small 16h\u22121 Mpc volume may slightly impact strong absorber statistics. We have checked that our results for the\nvzw case are generally applicable to all the momentumdriven wind models. In contrast, the cw model shows poor\nresolution convergence, and the disagreements with observations are significantly exacerbated as one moves to higher\nresolution.\n\n7\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have explored various models of galactic outflows incorporated into cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of\nstructure formation, and compared them with observations\nof IGM enrichment at z & 1.5. With no outflows, we show\n(in agreement with previous studies, e.g. Aguirre et al. 2001)\nthat a smattering of metals are distributed out to moderate overdensities through dynamical interactions, but cannot come close to enriching the diffuse IGM to observed\nvalues. Hence high-velocity outflows are required to enrich\nthe IGM to observed values. In order to allow flexibility and\nperform controlled tests of various scenarios, we implement\nthese outflows \"by hand\", tying the wind velocities (vw ) and\nmass loading factors (\u03b7) to galaxy properties through various parameterizations.\nIn this paper we show tests of five outflow models.\nMost of these models, and all successful ones, are based on\nmomentum-driven wind scenarios that are favored by observations of local starburst galaxies. We consider a constantwind (cw) model that produces strong, early outflows; a\nweak momentum-wind model (mw) that yields little IGM\nheating; an \"observed\" wind model (zw) obtained by taking\nthe observed scalings of local outflows at face value (not\na momentum-driven scenario); a strong momentum-wind\nmodel (mzw) calibrated by local starburst observations of\nMartin (2005); and a variable momentum wind model (vzw),\nwhere we have included a spread in wind speeds in accord\nwith observations of Rupke, Veilleux & Sanders (2005). Our\nmodels are chosen to span an interesting range in outflow\nstrengths, while broadly reproducing the global star formation rate density evolution down to z = 1.5.\nOur first main result is that the outflow models favored\nby local starburst observations, when applied to galaxies\nforming hierarchically across cosmic time, are able to reproduce a wide range of C iv absorption line observations during the epoch of peak cosmic star formation (z \u223c 1.5 \u2212 5.5).\nWe further demonstrate that this agreement is non-trivial,\nrequiring particular levels of metal and energy input into\nthe IGM as a function of time. In particular, winds should\n\n\f28\n\nB. D. Oppenheimer & R. Dav\u00e9\n\nFigure 19.

The 8 and 16 h\u22121 Mpc simulations appear resolution converged, while the 32 h\u22121 Mpc box underestimates weak\nabsorbers at high-z and possibly stronger absorbers at low-z.\n\nFigure 20. The b-parameters distributions in our three volumes for the vzw model. This demonstrates the w8n256vzw and w16n256vzw\nabsorbers are resolution-converged and fit the observations by BSR03, while the w32n256vzw absorbers are too wide. Using a Jeans\nlength argument (see text), we show that the 32 h\u22121 Mpc often has too poor resolution to properly resolve diffuse C iv absorbers.\n\nhave high enough speeds to enrich the diffuse IGM at early\ntimes, but low enough speeds not to overheat the IGM.\nWinds should also have mass loading factors high enough\nto suppress early star formation, but low enough to produce\nenough early metals. Generically, momentum-driven wind\nmodels produce the desired scalings, because they heavily\nsuppress early star formation but are able to distribute many\nof the metals formed into the IGM due to the high early\nmass loading factors in small galaxies. Yet, their low wind\nspeeds from small galaxies do not overheat the IGM. It is\ntherefore quite remarkable and non-trivial that our stronger\nmomentum-driven wind scenarios (mzw and vzw), based on\n\nphysical models calibrated by local observations of outflows,\nnaturally reproduce a wide variety of observations.\nOur second key result is that the lack of evolution observed in the properties of C iv absorption such as the global\nmass density in C iv systems (\u03a9(C iv) from z \u223c 5.5 \u2192 1.5\nis not necessarily indicative of a lack of continual enrichment, as has been argued previously (e.g. Songaila 2001;\nScannapieco et al. 2002). In all our models, most of the metals are ejected into the IGM during the heydey of star formation at z . 6, but our successful models also inject sufficient\nheat into the IGM to generate a drop in the C iv ionization\nfraction that roughly balances the increase in metallicity.\nThe success of the mzw and vzw models in matching \u03a9(C iv)\n\n\fSimulations of IGM Enrichment\nevolution renders unnecessary a putative population of early\nstar formation that enriches a large fraction of the IGM at\nz & 6.\nComparing various models to \u03a9(C iv) data showed that\nC iv is overproduced in the cw and zw models, primarily\nbecause early star formation is insufficiently suppressed and\ncopious metals are produced. While the large heat input\nfrom the cw model partially counteracts metal overproduction by lowering the C iv ionization fraction, it is insufficient\nto bring this model into agreement with data. Note that a\ncomparison to observed z \u223c 6 galaxy luminosity functions\nby Dav\u00e9 et al. (2006) also indicated that star formation is\nnot suppressed sufficiently early on in the cw model. One\ncould envision lowering the wind speed in the cw model to\nreduce the heat input and lower \u03a9(C iv), but this would\nexacerbate the overcooling problem at high redshifts. The\nhighest-z observations of \u03a9(C iv) tend to favor models that\nsuppress early star formation, which occurs naturally in the\nmomentum-wind driven scenarios (mzw, vzw) owing to high\nmass loading factors in small galaxies.\nThe column density distributions of C iv absorbers\npresent a test of the spatial distribution of metals. Models with overly weak winds such as mw cannot pollute the\nlow overdensity (\u03c1/\u03c1\u0304 \u223c few) IGM to reproduce the population of weak absorbers seen at z \u223c 3 \u2212 4. Once winds are\nstrong enough (vzw, mzw, even cw and zw), the shape and\n(lack of) evolution of the CDD is roughly as observed.\nObservations of the C iv linewidth (b-parameter) distribution shows little evolution, which again is generally reproduced in all our models. The linewidths provide constraints\non the temperature of absorbing gas, which seem to accommodate some but not too much feedback energy input, as\nprovided by the vzw, mzw, and mw models.\nPixel optical depth (POD) ratios provide a different way\nof characterizing C iv absorption, yet yield broadly similar\nconclusions. The C iv/H i POD ratio tests the amount and\nspatial distribution of the metals, because H i absorption is\ncorrelated with underlying gas density. Comparisons with\nour models show that cw distributes metals too widely, mw\nnot widely enough, and mzw and vzw lying in the intermediate range that agrees with data. The C iii/C iv POD ratio\nis a sensitive measure of temperature, and shows that the\ncw and possibly even mzw heat the IGM too much, while\nthe vzw and mw models match well.\nIn short, vzw and to a slightly lesser extent mzw are the\nonly models that match all observations of C iv absorption\nwe have considered, while reproducing a promising match to\nthe global observed star formation history. These observations provide sensitive tests of the metallicity and temperature structure of the IGM, making the agreement of these\nmodels an impressive achievement. The fact that these models are consistent with local observations of outflows provides an interesting connection between starbursts-driven\noutflows at all epochs.\nOur simulations also provide insights into the physical\neffects of outflows on the IGM. Both the vzw and mzw models show relatively low volume filling factor of Z > 10\u22123 Z\u2299\ngas, increasing from \u223c 2 \u2192 10% from z = 6 \u2192 2. Hence\nwidespread enrichment of the IGM is not required to match\nobservations, and in fact is disfavored as models that distribute metals more widely tend to overproduce C iv absorption. These results broadly agree with measurements of the\n\n29\n\nquiescence of the IGM at high redshift that suggest outflows\ncannot have impacted a significant volume (Rauch et al.\n2005). The metallicity-overdensity relation in the IGM is\nnot a power-law as is sometimes assumed, and instead shows\nrelatively flat enrichment at high overdensities, dropping off\nsteeply at lower overdensities. An interesting prediction of\nour models is that a significant fraction of C iv lines are collisionally ionized. However, this does not violate temperature\nconstraints on the IGM as seen from b-parameter distributions or C iii/C iv POD ratios. The median C iv absorber\ntraces higher overdensity and hotter gas at lower redshifts,\nand the optical depth is only weakly correlated with underlying gas density, unlike the tight relationship inferred for\nLy\u03b1 absorbers (e.g. Dav\u00e9 et al. 1999). This primarily owes\nto the large range of ionization fractions in C iv systems,\nfrom cooler photoionized absorbers to collisionally ionized\nsystems reaching T \u223c 3 \u00d7 105 K. The idea that C iv absorption arises almost exclusively in diffuse, photoionized gas\nfollowing a tight density-temperature relation similar to H i\nabsorbers is not favored by our models.\nWhile we present five wind models in this paper, we\nhave actually simulated over a dozen wind models, and decided to focus on these five because they are physically\nand/or observationally motivated, and best illustrate the relationship between outflow properties and IGM enrichment.\nNevertheless, the range of outflow models investigated in\nthis work is far from exhaustive, as one could envision more\ncomplex recipes that might still be consistent with observations. Hence our favored models should be regarded as\nplausible, but not uniquely successful.\nFurther uncertainties in the exact model that best describes galactic outflows comes from a range of systematic uncertainties we have not extensively considered in this\nwork. One uncertainty is the impact of Helium reionization\n(investigated briefly in \u00a75.1), which can impact the comparison of C iv absorption at early epochs. Unfortunately\nincluding this effect requires fairly precise knowledge of the\ntopology and epoch of Helium reionization, which is poorly\nconstrained at present. A second uncertainty is that our simulations were run with a cosmology that is slightly different\nthan that now favored by the 3rd-year WMAP release. In\nparticular, the new values of \u03c38 (now 0.75 as opposed to 0.9\nas we used) and \u03a9m (0.24 vs. 0.30) will significantly lower\nthe halo collapse fraction at high redshift (Spergel et al.\n2006). This means that the mass loading factors will need\nto be reduced relative to equation 3 to match observations\nof high-redshift star formation rates. The net effect should\nbe small: Given that observations dictate a certain global\nstar formation rate, any wind model that matches it will\nproduce a similar amount of metals. A third uncertainty involves the possible contribution of Population III stars to\nearly IGM enrichment. Our models, while not requiring it,\ncannot rule out some contribution from early massive star\nformation that might have higher yields and larger supernova energy input. More generally we have not considered\nthe possibility of IMF variations, although recent work hints\nat this (Fardal et al. 2006). A fourth uncertainty arises from\npossible contributions from AGN feedback in unbinding enriched gas from galaxies, as bright quasars have been observed at z > 6 (Fan et al. 2006). A fifth uncertainty is the\neffect of enriched stellar winds tecycling metals into the ISM,\nmostly from asymptotic giant branch stars, which will in-\n\n\f30\n\nB. D. Oppenheimer & R. Dav\u00e9\n\ncrease the net carbon yield from stars. Despite these caveats,\nthe fact that a plausible feedback model exists connecting\nlocal starbursts and high-z IGM enrichment represents significant progress towards quantifying the impact of outflows\non galaxies and the IGM across cosmic time.\nFurther constraints on outflows can be provided by examining IGM metal evolution to z \u223c 0, studying early IGM\nmetal enrichment extending into the reionization epoch,\nmatching the mass-metallicity evolution in galaxies, and reproducing the abundances patterns and gradients in galaxy\nclusters, among other things. We are currently investigating all these aspects, especially the impact of various outflow models on galaxy populations (see Dav\u00e9 et al. 2006).\nOn the theoretical side, it is of course preferable to generate and drive winds self-consistently out of galaxies rather\nthan having to include them \"by hand\", and progress is being made towards that end (e.g. Scannapieco et al. 2006).\nObservationally, we stress the need to obtain z > 4.5 observations of C iv capable of resolving thermal linewidths in\norder to constrain the physical nature of early feedback and\nmetallicity enrichment. In short, there remains much work\nto be done in order to obtain a fully self-consistent model of\nmetal evolution and distribution in the universe. Our work\nrepresents a small but important step forward in this area.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank A. Aguirre, K. Finlator, L. Hernquist, N. Katz, M.\nPettini, E. Ryan-Weber, J. Schaye, and R.
