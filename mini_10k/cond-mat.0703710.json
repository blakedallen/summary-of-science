The temperature dependence of the MW absorption data indicates the\nanomalous behavior near the \u03bb-point and displays the hysteretic character.\n\n1. Introduction\nAn observation of electric induction in superfluid 4He induced by relative motion of its\nnormal and superfluid components has been recently reported [1, 2]. This new extraordinary\neffect was revealed in two different types of experiments: electric potential oscillations were\ngenerated by a second-sound wave of which the velocities of normal \u03c5n and superfluid \u03c5s\n\u03c1\ncomponents relate as \u03c5 n = \u03c5 s s (here \u03c1s and \u03c1n are the densities of the superfluid and normal\n\u03c1n\ncomponents, respectively), and by liquid helium motion in a torsion oscillator whose walls affect\nthe normal component only. In both experiments, the amplitude of the electric potential induced\nwas about 10-8 \u2013 10-7 V. For liquid helium consisting of electrically neutral and spherically\nsymmetrical atoms, this observation was not expected. A reverse effect (second-sound wave\ngeneration by an ac electric field) was also observed.\nThe experimental finding of mechanoelectric effect in He II has stimulated a number of\ntheoretical studies aiming to explain its mechanism [3-8]. On the basis of experiments [1, 2], it\ncould be assumed that the relative motion of the normal and superfluid components is a result of\ninternal electromagnetic forces related to the macroscopic quantum ordering. Anyway, these\n1\n\n\fexperiments indicate that there is a certain relationship between mechanical and electric\nphenomena in superfluid helium whose nature is not clearly understood.\nIn this work, we continue our study the relationship between mechanical and electric\nphenomena in superfluid helium using microwaves. It is expected that the electric component of\na MW will generate superfluid and normal flows in He II which, in turn, will interact with the\nMW. In addition to previous studies of MW absorption in He II [9-11], we use microwaves of\nsubstantially higher frequencies comparable with typical frequencies of rotons.\n\n2. Experiment.\nThe setup used to measure the absorption of an electromagnetic wave by liquid helium in the\nfrequency range of 40 \u2013 198 GHz is shown schematically in Fig. 1.\nFig. 1. Diagram of experiment:\n1 \u2013 dielectric disc resonator,\n2 \u2013 dielectric waveguides,\n3 \u2013hollow metallic waveguide,\n4 \u2013 electromagnetic source,\n5 \u2013 operation regime switch,\n6 \u2013 detecting module,\n7 \u2013 matching block,\n8 \u2013 personal computer,\n9 - modulator,\n10 \u2013 low-frequency oscillator,\n11 - detector,\n12 - amplifier.\n\nThe measurement was made with a dielectric disc resonator operating in the \"whispering\ngallery\" mode [12-14]. Resonator 1 with d = 19.00 mm in diameter and h = 1.0 mm in\nthickness was perfectly suitable for generating high-Q whispering gallery modes [13]:\nm\u03bb0 3\n\u03bb\nd\u2265\n, h\u2264 0 ,\n(1)\n\n\u03c0 \u03b5\n\n\u03b5\n\nwhere \u03bb is the vacuum space wavelength, m is the azimuthal mode index, \u03b5 is the material\ndielectric permittivity. Resonator 1 was manufactured with the optical precision high-quality\ncrystalline quartz. Its principal axis was along that of the cylinder. Prior to the low temperature\nexperiment, the resonator surface was carefully cleaned in an ultrasonic bath.\nIt is known that the device measuring the absorption of electromagnetic waves must be\nperfectly matched with the system under investigation to have comparable wave resistance. The\nQ-factor of the resonator and hence its wave resistance Roe increases considerably at low\ntemperatures. It was therefore important to restrict the growth of Roe. For this purpose the\ndistance between antennas 2 and resonator 1 was selected so that the waveguides could induce\nadditional losses thereby limiting the resonator Q-factor in vacuum to Q ~ 105. In this case\nRoe= Q\u03c1 was ~ 5 MOhm (\u03c1 - is the wave resistance of the waveguide) and was not temperature\ndependent.\nThe resonator 1 was mounted horizontally in the cell filled with liquid helium and\nsupported by spring-loaded metallic rods set at the disc center. In the whispering gallery mode\nthe rods had a minimum effect on the resonance properties of the resonator and the resonance\noscillation energy was concentrated near the cylindrical surface. The resonator was operated in\nthe mode of the passing electromagnetic wave. Dielectric rectangular waveguides 2 made of\n2\n\n\fisotropic quartz served as exciting and receiving antennas. They had an absorbing element at one\nend. The other rectangular ends were pasted hermetically into hollow metallic pipes\n(waveguides 3) coming out from the cryostat. The vector of the electric component of exciting\nelectromagnetic field was perpendicular to the disc axis.\nThe oscillation spectrum of the system consisting of radial and azimuthal modes was\nregistered on-line on monitor 8. Only the azimuthal HEmn\u03b4 - type (whispering gallery) modes\nwith the radial n = 1 and azimuthal m = 17 \u2013 110 indexes were used in these experiments. The\nfrequency spacing between the adjacent modes was ~ 2 GHz. The frequency tuning was realized\nby mating block 7. The tuning step was 1 \u2013 10 MHz on rough tuning and 140 kHz on fine tuning.\nThe scanning velocity in the precision regime was 100 Hz/sec. To stabilize the frequency\nregime, the generator was first subjected to long-duration heating at the required control voltage.\nIn the course of the experiment the control voltage was varied within several millivolts to keep\nthe thermal condition of the backward-wave tube undisturbed.\nThe resonator was excited with a set of generators 4 covering the frequency range 40 \u2013\n200 GHz. Its lower bound was limited by the waveguide cut-off-frequency. Two regime were\nused \u2013 frequency scanning (regime 1) and fixed-frequency measurement (regime 2). The regimes\nwere put into operation with switch 5. The basic measurements were made in regime 1. The\ncontrol of generators 4 data acquisition and processing were carried out by using receiving\nmodule 6 and machine block 7 [15]. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio, the electromagnetic\nwave was modulated with modulator 9 and low-frequency generator 10. The signal that passed\nthrough the low temperature part of the unit was detected with detector 11 and fed to lowbandpass amplifier 12.\nThe resonance field in the dielectric disc resonator was excited solely by traveling waves.\nResonance was observed when the phase of the traveling wave coincided on each subsequent\npassage of the wave along the generating line of the resonator. The electromagnetic field of these\noscillations was concentrated in a narrow spatial area adjacent to the cylindrical surface of the\nresonator. The field decreased exponentially along the radial axis on moving away from the\nsurface (Fig. 2).\n3. Shapes of resonance peaks.\n\nFig. 2. Electromagnetic energy distribution in the standing\nwave of whispering gallery mode (m=24) in the dielectric\nresonator. Dark regions \u2013 antinodes of the electric\ncomponent of the field\n\nThe amplitude \u2013frequency characteristic\nof the resonator was first measured in helium\ngas at T = 4.2 K and the pressure of 3 \u2013\n5 Torr. These conditions ensured reliable\ncooling of the whole system. Then the mode\nwas selected at the required frequency. The\nhighest value of the signal amplitude was\ntaken as a 100 % resonator transmission in\nthis mode. When liquid helium was\ncondensed to the cell, the resonance mode\nfrequencies shifted in accordance with the\nchange in the liquid dielectric permittivity.\nThe signal amplitude decreased as the\ndielectric losses grew larger. We could thus\ncompare the losses in liquid helium and in\nvacuum.\nFig. 3 shows the resonance curves for\ntwo modes at ~ 67 GHz (Fig. 3a) and ~\n180 GHz (Fig. 3b). The measurements were\nmade in vacuum (curves on the left) and in\nliquid helium (curves on the right). The curves\n3\n\n\fwere processed by approximating their Lorentz functions (see Ref. [15])\nA0\n,\nA( f ) =\n(2)\n2\n\u239b\n\u239e\nf\n1 + 4Q 2 \u239c\u239c \u2212 1\u239f\u239f\n\u239d f0 \u23a0\nwhere A(f) is the current value of the signal amplitude, A0 is the maximum amplitude. Two\nparameters \u2013 resonance frequency f0 and Q-factor \u2013 were determined. It is seen that the signal\namplitude in liquid helium (AL) is less against the signal amplitude in vacuum (AV).\n\na)\n\nb)\n\nFig. 3. Typical resonance curves of whispering gallery modes obtained with a dielectric disc resonator with\nm = 29 (a) and m = 78 (b). \u2022 \u2013 vacuum at T = 4.2 K; \u03bf - liquid helium. Inset in Fig. b: the portion of resonance\nabsorption in the precision scanning regime (enlarged scale, averaging over 25 curves).\n\nIn contrast to other modes, the m = 78 mode had a specific resonance peak in the liquid\nappearing as a sharp dip in the smooth resonance curve at a certain fixed frequency - dependent\non temperature (Fig. 3b, inset). We attribute the feature to the resonance absorption of the\nelectromagnetic wave at this frequency (see below). It was found that a decrease in the signal\namplitude was frequency-dependent, \u0394A/AV = {AV - AL}/ AV. It can be taken as a quantitative\ncharacteristic of the relaxation (dielectric) losses in the liquid. The resonance absorption of the\nelectromagnetic wave can be described by the ratio AR/AV. Since the modes had different\namplitudes and Q-factors in vacuum, the \u0394A and AR values were normalized to AV of the\ncorresponding mode.\n\n4. Creation of single rotons.\n\nThe typical spectra of dielectric losses and resonance electromagnetic wave absorption in\nHe II taken at two temperatures are shown in Fig. 4. It is seen that the spectrum of dielectric\nlosses (axis on the left) has a broad maximum in the band of 40 \u2013 80 GHz, which increases with\nincreasing the temperature. The losses can be brought about by consumption of the a.c. electric\nfield energy of the wave to create phonons with energy 2 \u2013 4 K in He II. The process intensity\nrises on approaching the \u03bb-point (see [10]) presumably due to the fluctuations in the vicinity of\nthe phase transition.\nFig. 4 also illustrates a new effect \u2013 resonance absorption of an electromagnetic wave at a\ncertain frequency fR temperature which depends on temperature. The process has two specific\nfeatures: (i) the Q-factor of the mode decreases by 5 \u2013 20 % when fR coincides with the mode\nfrequency; (ii) a very narrow absorption line appears in the smooth spectrum of relaxation losses.\n4\n\n\fThe signal amplitude decreases by AR at f = fR (Fig. 3b, inset). Because of the finite bandwidth\nof the generator, it was impossible to measure the absorption linewidth precisely. The resonance\nabsorption lines were observable owing to their width at the bases (several tens of kHz). The\nhighest power fed to the resonator was about 1 mW. Let note that the effect was powerindependent. Namely, the resonance frequency fR did not change when the power was decreased\nby ~ 40 dB.\nAt T = 1.4 K (Fig. 4b) the resonance absorption frequency corresponds to the energy\n~ 8.65 K, which coincides with the minimum roton energy \u0394 (roton gap). It is natural to relate\nthe effect observed to the creation of roton excitations in He II, which consumes the\nelectromagnetic wave energy. To make sure that scenario was correct, we performed\nmeasurements at different temperatures. As T\u03bb was approached, fR decreased and moved from\none mode to another. The temperature dependences of the resonance frequency and the roton gap\nare shown in Fig. 5 along with neutron scattering data for \u0394 [16, 17]. The results obtained by\ndifferent methods are in very good agreement and thus support the idea of roton creation during\nthe interaction between He II and the electromagnetic wave of a certain frequency.\nWe should emphasize that the shape of the resonance curve indicated an evolution as the\ntemperature varied (Fig. 6). The resonance curved was measured using the precision regime of\nscanning (100Hz/s) by changing the oscillator voltage U. The Fig. 6 shows that the resonance\nabsorption lines are resolutionable reliable and their width increases as the temperature rises.\nThe interaction of electromagnetic waves with elementary excitations in superfluid\nhelium was previously investigated by the Raman method [18]. The Raman spectrum contained\na sharp asymmetrical peak corresponding to the energy difference between the incident and\nreflected photons 18.5 \u00b1 0.5 K, which is close to 2\u0394. Later on it was found that the interaction of\nthe electromagnetic wave with He II leads to the formation of a bound double-roton state with\nthe binding energy 0.37 \u00b1 0.10 K [19]. The rotons forming the bound state have almost equal but\noppositely directed momentum.\nThe sharp peak of resonance absorption of the electromagnetic wave observed in our\nexperiments corresponds to creation of a single roton. However, the momentum conservation\nlaw does not hold in this partial case because the momentum of the roton exceeds that of an\nincident photon by many orders of magnitude. Until now, no roton-like quasiparticle with very\nsmall momentum has been detected in He II though its possibility has been a subject of\ndiscussions [20-22]. In particular, this possibility can be realized when an elementary excitation\nis produced by transferring the particle from the Bose-condensate to the above-condensate state\nbecause this requires finite energy. The spectrum of such excitations has a gap. Note that in its\nearlier version, the Landau theory of superfluidity admitted along with phonons, the existence of\nparticles whose spectrum has a gap at zero momentum [21].\nIt is more reasonable to explain the resonance absorption of the electromagnetic wave at\nf = 180.3 GHz proceeding from the condition of this experiment in which the photon-superfluid\nhelium interaction occurs near the resonator wall.

Shape of the resonance curve at various temperatures: a - T=1.63K; b - T=2.2K\n\nof a single roton is impossible at this high frequency because of violation of conservation laws.\nIn our experiment the boundary between the superfluid helium and the dielectric resonator\ncreates inhomogeneity. We can thus assume that the boundary takes on the excessive momentum\nof the roton. To put it differently, the interaction of the electromagnetic wave with superfluid\nhelium near the resonator wall leads to creation of a phonon in the solid wall [22], as well.\nThe effect of resonance absorption of an electromagnetic wave was also observed above\nthe \u03bb-point. In this case fR ~ 120 GHz, which corresponds to \u0394 ~ 5.2 K and is in good agreement\nwith neutron scattering data.\nA very narrow resonance line means that there are coherent processes in the system.\nThese processes might be associated with interaction between atoms which has an\nelectromagnetic origin. The problem will be studied in the future.\n\n7\n\n\f5. Kinetics of the signal amplitude variation.\n\nThe signal amplitude was investigated under the conditions of varying temperature of\nliquid helium and its stabilization. The measurements were made in regime 2. The kinetics of the\nrelative amplitude AL/A2.3 on cooling the liquid from 2.3 to 1.9 K and subsequent temperature\nstabilization (A2.3 is the largest signal amplitude at T = 2.3 K) is shown in Fig. 7. The\nmeasurement at the frequency of the m = 78 mode shows that absorption increases appreciably\nas the liquid helium temperature approaches T\u03bb. The absorption peak appears several minutes\nafter temperature stabilization (T = 1.9 K). The value of AL/A2.3 takes on a new steady value\nsomewhat higher than that at the initial T = 2.3 K.\nThe observed features can be interpreted in terms of the following concepts. According to\nRef. [1] the ac electric field generates the second sound in He II, i.e. the relative motion of the\nnormal and superfluid components. When liquid helium was cooled in this experiment below\nthe \u03bb-point, the electric component of the electromagnetic wave generated counterflow of the\nnormal and superfluid components around the resonator cylindrical surface. The normal\ncomponent is clamped near the resonator wall, and persistent superfluid flow is produced. The\nfeatures of the signal amplitude (see Fig. 7) are due to the interaction of the microwave with the\nsuperfluid flow in He II. The character of the electromagnetic wave absorption is strongly\ndependent on the velocity of the superfluid flow Vs. This was demonstrated in special\nexperiments [23] in which Vs was varied using devices similar to Kapitza's \"hydrodynamic\nguns\" [24]. The Vs and Vn flows were generated with a heater. Two guns generated superfluid\nflow moving tangentially to the cylindrical surface of the resonator. As a result, the total\nsuperfluid flow could vary from zero to a certain maximum value. The impact of the directed\nsuperfluid flows on the electromagnetic wave absorption will be discussed comprehensively in a\nspecial paper (see Ref. [23] for brief information and results). Note that the superfluid flow\nsuppresses significantly the Q-factor at all modes, which is indicative of additional dissipation.\nThe features of the signal amplitude become evident with a certain delay (see Fig. 7)\nfollowing the superfluid transition. This implies that the formation of superfluid flows takes\nsome time (several minutes). The signal amplitude continued to vary even upon stabilization of\ntemperature. The new regime also took several minutes to reach a steady state. Fig. 7 shows that\nthe state of the system in He II (at 1.9 K) corresponds to larger electromagnetic wave dissipation\nthan in He I (at 2.3 K).\n\n1,0\n0,9\nAL/AV\n\na)\n\n0,8\n0,7\n0,6\n0,5\n\n2,4\n\n0\n\n2\n\nT,K\n\n2,2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\nT\u03bb\n\nb)\n\n2,0\n1,8\n1,6\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\nTime, min.\n\nFig. 7.

Temperature dependence of signal amplitude for\nm = 78 mode on cooling (curve 1) and heating\n(curve 2) the system.\n\n8\n\n\fThe results shown in Fig. 6 were obtained when cooling the system. As the system was\nheated, the temperature dependence of the signal amplitude had a noticeable hysteresis\n(see Fig. 8). The hysteretic effect may be due to the fact that the superfluid flows formed in He II\nare quite stable and decay only in the immediate vicinity of the \u03bb-point. A similar hysteretic\neffect was equally observed in the experiment with a torsion oscillator [2] in which a superfluid\nflow appeared as well.\nNote that earlier the maximum of dielectric losses (f = 36.6 GHz) [10] and a sharp\ndecrease in the Q-factor accompanied by hysteretic effects (f = 73.7 GHz) were also observed for\nthe electromagnetic wave propagated in the liquid helium at temperatures in the vicinity of \u03bbpoint.\nAnother interesting finding is that the superfluid flow around the resonator registered by\nMW absorption is very sensitive to the cryostat orientation with respect to the Earth's rotation\naxis. When the cryostat is tilted at a certain angle, the superfluid flow either escapes from the\nresonator or becomes destroyed. Similar effects have been observed recently by Packard's group\n[25]. Of course, these results are beyond the scope of this paper and require additional\ninvestigations.\n6. Conclusion.\n\nFor the first time we have presented strong evidence that in superfluid helium there is the\nresonance absorption of microwaves whose frequency corresponds to the frequency of a single\nroton. This indicates that a MW creates rotons near the resonator wall. The resonance frequency\nis found to decrease as the temperature rises, which exactly corresponds to the temperature\ndependence of the roton gap obtained from neutron scattering data. It is important that these\nresults confirm the existence of the relationship between mechanical and electric processes in\nsuperfluid helium observed previously. In particular, the electric component of the MW field\ninduces the relative motion of the normal and superfluid components. Since the flow of normal\ncomponent is clamped near walls, this relative motion reveals itself as a circular superfluid flow\naround the resonator wall. We assume that the interaction of the MW with superfluid helium\noccurs owing to liquid polarization and appearance of macroscopic dipole moment whose origin\nis still to be found. It is quite likely that the superfluid transition is accompanied by a\nspontaneous ordering of microscopic dipole moments of the atoms.\nThe authors thank A. F. Andreev, V. N.
