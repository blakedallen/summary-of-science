It\nhas been shown by several authors (e.g. Bedijn 1987) that\nthis sequence reflects the increase of optical thickness\nof the circumstellar envelope (CSE) of AGB stars, the\nobjects with the thinnest CSE being placed in the bluest\npart and those with the thickest CSE in the reddest part\nof the sequence. However, this can be interpreted in two\ndifferent ways: i) as an evolutionary sequence (e.g. van\nder Veen & Habing 1988): every O-rich AGB star would\nstart the AGB phase at the blue end of this sequence,\nand would later move while increasing its mass-loss rate\nuntil reaching the red extreme at the end of the AGB;\nii) as mass sequence (e.g. L\u00e9pine et al. 1995): their\ndifferent location would be just a consequence of their\ndifferent initial mass, which would determine the massloss rate. A third interpretation was proposed, which is a\ncombination of the previous ones: all O-rich AGB stars\nwould move towards redder colours as they increase their\nmass-loss rate, but only the more massive stars would be\nable to reach the reddest end of the sequence (Garc\u00edaLario 1992). In addition, there is not a common opinion\non the evolutionary connection between different classes\nof AGB stars and different classes of Planetary Nebulae\n(PNe).\n\nRecently, we have published the result of a large\nscale near-infrared photometric survey of two different\nsamples of O-rich AGB stars (Jim\u00e9nez-Esteban et al.\n2005a,b): the 'Arecibo sample' (363) and the 'GLMP\nsample' (94). In total we compiled 457 stars providing\na good coverage of the 'O-rich AGB sequence' (Figure\n1).\nThe two samples are complementary. The 'Arecibo\nsample' is mainly formed by objects from the blue part\nof the sequence, with a small contribution from very red\nsources, while the 'GLMP sample' contains exclusively\nsources in the redder part of the sequence.\n\nOn the evolutionary connection between AGB stars and PNe\n\nRESULTS\nFor all the objects in the sample we have collected:\nJ (1.25 \u03bc m), H (1.65 \u03bc m) and K (2.2 \u03bc m) photometric data from our own observations or from the\n2MASS Point Source Catalogue (PSC); A (8.28 \u03bc m), C\n(12.13 \u03bc m), D (14.65 \u03bc m) and E (21.3 \u03bc m) flux densities from the MSX6C PSC; and 12, 25, 60 and 100 \u03bc m\nphotometry from the IRAS PSC. Based on these data\nwe constructed their Spectral Energy Distributions from\nthe near- to the far-infrared domain, and estimated the\nbolometric flux by integrating, and extrapolating toward\nboth shorter and longer wavelengths.\nThe absolute luminosity of AGB stars is still subject to\nNovember 5, 2018\n\n1\n\n\fFIGURE 1. The position of the AGB stars in the sample in the IRAS two-colour diagram (open circles for the 'Arecibo sample';\nfilled triangles for the 'GLMP sample'; filled circles for the few objects in common). The solid line is the 'O-rich AGB sequence'.\n\ndebate. We have selected 41 sources detected in the direction of the Galactic Bulge (GB) and assumed a common distance to all these sources equivalent to the generally assumed distance to the Galactic Center of \u2248 8 kpc\n(Reid 1993). Figure 2 shows the distribution of absolute luminosities. Although a wide range of luminosities is found, however, the distribution is strongly peaked\naround 3 500 L\u2299 . This maximum is in very good agreement with the one previously determined by other authors, who studied mainly bluer samples of AGB stars\nin the GB (e.g. Habing et al. 1985; Blommaert et al.\n1998; Jackson et al. 2002) and in the solar neighborhood (Knauer et al. 2001). It appears that the luminosity distribution is similar throughout the Galaxy and not\nvery dependent on the colours. Therefore, we assumed a\ncommon and constant luminosity of 3 500 L\u2299 for all the\nsources as a first approximation to their real luminosity,\nto obtain the distance and then the galactic height z.\n\nFIGURE 2. Absolute bolometric luminosity in thousands of\nL\u2299 of the AGB stars belonging to the GB.\n\nof the 'O-rich AGB sequence':\n\nINTERPRETATION OF THE 'O-RICH\nAGB SEQUENCE'\nThe position of each star in the IRAS two-colour diagram\nhas been re-defined, via the following parameterization\n\nOn the evolutionary connection between AGB stars and PNe\n\n[12]\u2212[25] = 0.912 Ln \u03bb\n\n\uf8fc\n\uf8fd\n\n[25]\u2212[60] = \u22122.42 + 0.72 \u03bb \uf8fe\n\nThis way each star was assigned a \u03bb value which\ncorresponds to the nearest point on the 'O-rich AGB\nsequence'. Thus, low values of \u03bb correspond to objects\nlocated in the blue part of the sequence and high values\nof \u03bb to those located in the red part of it.\nNovember 5, 2018\n\n2\n\n\fFIGURE 3.\n\nFIGURE 4.\n\n|z| distribution as a function of \u03bb .\n\n|z| distribution as a function of vexp .\n\nFigure 3 shows the distance to the galactic plane (|z|)\nas a function of the \u03bb , excluding the GB subsample. We\nfound a very clear trend in the sense that sources with\nlow values of \u03bb have a wider distribution than the redder\nsources. This implies that the redder part of the 'O-rich\nAGB sequence' must be populated mainly with objects\nof higher mass.\nThe expansion velocity (vexp ) of the circumstellar shell\nhas been proposed to be correlated with the progenitor\nmass (Baud & Habing 1983; Garc\u00eda-Lario 1992). vexp\nwas derived for the stars in our sample from the OH\nmaser measurements. Figure 4 shows that there is also\na very clear correlation between z and vexp in the sense\nthat there is a deficit of stars with high vexp at high\nz. In addition, among the sources with low z most of\nthem have high vexp . In Figure 5 we show that sources\nwith high vexp are found in all areas of the 'O-rich\nAGB sequence'. This means that the objects with high\nvexp , regardless the colour, in mean must have higher\nprogenitor masses than those with low vexp .\nOn the evolutionary connection between AGB stars and PNe\n\nFIGURE 5. \u03bb distribution as a function of vexp .\n\nFIGURE 6.\n\nScale height distribution H as a function of \u03bb .\n\nWe conclude that the red part of the 'O-rich AGB\nsequence' (high \u03bb ) is mainly populated by sources with\nhigher progenitor mass. In contrast, the blue part of the\n'O-rich AGB sequence' is populated by a combination of\nAGB stars of low and high progenitor mass. As objects\nwith low progenitor mass are almost not found at high\nvalues of \u03bb , they must abandon the AGB phase without\nreaching the red end of the 'O-rich AGB sequence'.\n\nEVOLUTIONARY CONNECTIONS\nIn order to search for evolutionary connections between\nthe objects populating the 'O-rich AGB sequence' and\nother samples of AGB stars and PNe taken from the\nliterature, we have divided the sample in bins of \u03bb and\nobtained their galactic scale heights H (Figure 6). The\nscale heights decrease with increasing \u03bb , with particular\nlarge H at the blue end and very low H at the red\nend. We have split our sample first into 3 subsamples\nNovember 5, 2018\n\n3\n\n\fTABLE 1. Subsamples identified.\nSample\nExt. Blue\nBlue\nTrans.\nRed\nExt.

The resulting subsamples\nare listed in Table 1.\nThe extremely blue subsample has an associated galactic scale height H remarkably similar to that found\nfor optically bright Mira variables with short periods\n(< 300d ; Jura 1994). O-rich Type III PNe (very low mass\nO-rich PNe) also have a similar mean z (Maciel & Dutra\n1992).\nThe blue subsample shows a value of H similar to\nthat found by Ortiz & Maciel (1996) for their sample of\nOH/IR stars in the solar neighborhood, and with that obtained by Wood & Cahn (1977) for their sample of Mira\nvariables near the Galactic Plane, which is a combination\nof both short and long period Miras. Type II PNe, which\nare a mixture of O-rich and C-rich PN, have also similar\nmean z (Maciel & Dutra 1992).\nThe transition subsample populates the region in\nwhich AGB stars become optically thick. This subsample has an associated H which is consistent with the\nvalue obtained by Jura & Kleinmann (1992) and Jura et\nal. (1993) for intermediate- and long-period (300 \u2013 500d )\nMira variables, and by Groenewegen et al. (1992) for a\nsmall group of low mass optically bright carbon stars.\nWe conclude that these first three subsamples contain\nMira variables, with periods increasing with the value of\n\u03bb . They mostly will evolve into O-rich Type II (and III)\nPNe. A fraction of the stars in the transition subsample\nmight evolve into C-rich Type II PNe.\nThe value of H in the red subsample is similar to the\none obtained for carbon star samples which include a significant fraction of very red carbon stars ('infrared carbon stars'). (Claussen et al. 1987; Groenewegen et al.\n1992). It is also similar to the mean value of z associated\nto N-rich Type I PN (Maciel & Dutra 1992). We therefore\nsuspect that part of the stars in the red subsample change\ntheir chemical composition from O-rich to C-rich during\ntheir evolution in the AGB phase as a consequence of\nthe dredge-up processes that the theory predicts for intermediate mass stars. Hot bottom burning (HBB) may\n\nOn the evolutionary connection between AGB stars and PNe\n\nprevent the conversion to carbon stars of the rest, ending\nup as N-rich Type I PN.\nThe last subsample, the extremely red subsample, has a\nextremely low value of H. These objects should then represent the most massive AGB stars in our Galaxy. These\nstars must be massive enough to activate HBB. Note that\nthere is no PN class which can be associated to this subsample. It is possible that these massive stars evolve so\nfast that when the central star reaches the necessary temperature to ionize the envelope, the shell is still thick\nenough to prevent its detection as a PN in the optical.\nThese massive AGB stars may never form visible PNe.\nRather they would evolve as 'infrared PNe' and might be\nrelated with the rare group of so-called 'OHPNe' (Zijlstra et al. 1989), heavily obscured sources which show\nboth OH maser and radio continuum emission.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was partially supported by the Spanish\nMinisterio de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda through grant\nAYA2003\u221209499.
