Our\ntreatment is essentially geometrical. We start with Maxwell equations in five-dimensions and project them into an arbitrary brane.\nThe formalism is quite general and allows us to consider curved bulk\nspaces and curved branes whose tension is not necessarily null. The kinetic electromagnetic term induced on the world volume of the brane,\nproper of DGP models, is incorporated in this formulation by means of\nan appropriate match condition. We also give an estimate of each term\nof the effective field equations and determine the domain in which the\nfour-dimensional Maxwell equations can be recovered in the brane.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nAccording to recent braneworld scenarios all fields of the Standard Model\nare trapped in a four-dimensional (4D) spacetime, which is seen as a manifold embedded in a higher-dimensional space [1, 2, 3, 4]. In this picture\nthe ambient space, or bulk, appears to be more fundamental, in a sense,\n1\n\n\fthan the ordinary four-dimensional spacetime. Therefore it seems plausible\nthat the basic laws of physics should primarily be formulated in this higherdimensional setting. According to this view, the apparent validity of our familiar four-dimensional laws would merely appear as a consequence of more\nfundamental higher-dimensional laws [5, 6, 7, 8]. This is very much in the\nspirit of the original Kaluza-Klein theory and its modern versions where the\nfundamental field equations, which unify gravity and electromagnetism, are\nformulated in a higher-dimensional manifold [9]. Another proposal that essentially follows the same principle is known as the induced-matter approach\n[10, 11, 12]. Here the fundamental field equations are again five-dimensional\n(5D) and four-dimensional macroscopic matter configurations are regarded\nas a purely geometrical manifestation of the extra dimension. Of course the\n\"embedding\" of a four-dimensional theory into five or higher dimensions is\nnaturally subjected to the so-called embedding theorems [13]. In the case of\nthe induced-matter approach the embedding is guaranteed by the well-known\nCampbell-Magaard theorem [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 18, 20], whereas in the case of\nbranes an extended version of the latter is the relevant mathematical result\nto be used [21, 22].\nA fundamental ingredient in the brane world scenarios is the mechanism\nof field localization. In the context of string theories these mechanisms arises\nvery naturally [23]. But, there also exist methods of localization based on\nfield-theoretic framework such as the capture of fermions by topological defects [24, 25]. In this paper we are going to consider localization mechanisms\nof vector fields provided by field-theoretic means. However, in a sense, the\nconfinement of massless gauge fields requires a more intricate mechanism than\nthose methods applicable to matter fields. The reason is that gauge fields\ntrapped by topological defects will not be massless unless new elements be\nadded to the theory [26]. Furthermore, as it was pointed out in Ref. [27], the\nconfinement of gauge fields should preserve the universality of charge in the\nbrane, but a hypothetical mechanism that was based on a direct localization\nof the zero mode in topological defects would have little chance to fulfill this\nprinciple.\nThere are alternative approaches which avoid these problems satisfactorily. Among them, we can mention models in which the confinement is\nperformed by gravity [28, 29]. As a matter of fact, if the bulk is a fivedimensional warped space, it is known that gravity is not strong enough to\nkeep the vector field localized in the brane [30, 31]. However, the confinement can work appropriately by adding new warped extra dimensions which\n2\n\n\fare also compact. Other models follow a complete different approach. They\npropose a modification of the gauge field equations in the bulk in order to\nachieve the localization in the brane [26, 32, 33, 34, 35].\nIn this paper we are going to focus our discussion on the well-known DGP\nmodel [36], because of its generality (it can be employed in any theories\nwith extra-dimensions) and interesting physical implications, specially, for\ncosmology [37] (such as the possibility of explaining the late accelerated phase\nof expansion of the Universe). The appearance of DGP model might be seen\nas a further step in the road of extra dimension theories. Indeed, roughly\nspeaking, we might say that the history of these theories begins with KaluzaKlein's idea of tiny compact dimensions and develops towards the RSII model\nof infinite large dimension [4]. It turns out that within the RSII model the\nproper world volume integrated along the extra dimension is finite because of\nthe warping factor. With DGP model this last constraint is abandoned and\nwe are led to a consistent large extra dimension model which is also world\nvolume infinite [36].\nThe basic assumption of DGP model is that radiative quantum corrections associated to the interactions between the bulk gauge fields and localized matter in the brane might be effectively incorporated in the theory by\nadding a new term in the Lagrangean, which corresponds to a kinetic term\nfor the bulk fields, restricted to the world volume of the brane.\nOur main goal in this paper is to obtain a covariant formulation of the\neffective equation for the electromagnetism in DGP scenario. In other words,\nwe are interested in finding out how 4D-observers describe the behavior of\nthe electromagnetic field, considering that they live confined in a brane (with\na not necessarily null tension) in the context of DGP scenario. We will start\nwith a five-dimensional version of Maxwell equations, which we will assume\nto hold in the bulk, and by using the formalism of embedding theory we will\ndetermine the induced equation in the brane. The covariant formalism used\nhere is very general and embodies a great variety of geometric configurations.\nIndeed, except for the reflection symmetry, there is no restriction imposed\non the geometry of the bulk and brane's manifolds.\nAs we shall see, the effective field equations contains additional terms as\ncompared to the usual Maxwell equations and possess two important parameters: the brane tension (\u03bb) and the five-dimensional electromagnetic coupling\nconstant. We are going to suggest a possible physical interpretation for the\nnew terms from the point of view of the 4D-observers and give an estimate\nfor them relatively to the parameters.\n3\n\n\fBy considering the electromagnetic coupling constant, the ratio between\nthe four-dimensional and the five-dimensional values establishes a length\nscale in the DGP model (rc ) [38]. A very peculiar feature of DGP model\nis the prediction that deviations from the four-dimensional behavior occurs\nat ultra-large distances as compared to rc , unlike other extra dimension theories.\nIn a brane with a non-zero tension, there will be two length scales regulating the effective equations: (G5 \u03bb)\u22121 and rc , where G5 is the five-dimensional\ngravitational constant. Of course, the induced equations on the brane should\nbe consistent with all experimental data related to electromagnetic phenomena. Based on our estimates we are going to study the dependence of the\neffective field equations on these parameters and check under what condition\nMaxwell equations could be recovered.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present the basics of\nthe embedding formalism and the techniques of projecting general tensors\non hypersurfaces. In Section 3, we establish a relation between the intrinsic\nand the projected electromagnetic field in a hypersurface, by means of which\nwe find the effective equations in the hypersurface. We proceed with Section\n4, where we discuss the question whether any solution of the 4D Maxwell\nequations might be reproduced from five dimensions. In section 5, assuming\nthe reflection symmetry and using the appropriate match condition we obtain\nthe effective field equations for the electromagnetic field in DGP scenario.\nHere we also discuss the low-energy limit of the effective equations. Finally,\nSection 5 contains our final remarks.\n\n2\n\nThe embedding formalism\n\nIn this section we shall employ some techniques from differential geometry\nin order to set the basic equations that regulates the embedding of the fourdimensional electromagnetic equations in higher dimensions. We start by\nrecalling some definitions.\nLet us assume that our n-dimensional spacetime \u03a3 is embedded into a\nspace M\u0302 with (n + 1) dimensions and let \u03c6 : \u03a3 \u2192 M\u0302 be the embedding map.\nThen, by definition of embedding, the image \u03c6 (\u03a3) is a hypersurface of M\u0302 [39].\nNow, if \u03a3 and M\u0302 are equipped with the metrics g and g\u0303, respectively, then\nthe embedding is said to be isometric if the intrinsic metric of \u03a3 corresponds\n\n4\n\n\fto the induced metric in the hypersurface, i.e., if the condition\ng (v, w) = \u011d (d\u03c6 (v) , d\u03c6 (w))\n\n(1)\n\nholds for any vectors v and w of the tangent space Tp \u03a3 for every p \u2208 \u03a3 1 .\nSince \u03c6 is a homeomorphism let us, henceforth, identify \u03a3 with \u03c6 (\u03a3) and as\nthe differential map d\u03c6 is injective\nthere is no confusion if we write simply v\n\b\nin place of d\u03c6 (v) . Now let y A and {x\u03bc } be local coordinate systems of M\u0302\nand \u03a3, respectively 2 . The embedding map in terms of these coordinates is\ndescribed by the functions y A = \u03c6A (x). Of course, the image of any vector\nv \u2208Tp \u03a3 belongs also to the tangent space Tp M\u0302 of the ambient space M\u0302 and,\nthen, can be written in terms of the coordinate basis {\u2202A }3 . In particular,\nwe can write \u2202\u03b1 = eA\n\u03b1 \u2202A , where\n\u2202\u03c6A\n=\n(2)\n\u2202x\u03b1\nare the elements of the differential map d\u03c6 written with respect to the given\ncoordinates. The isometric condition (1) expressed relatively to the coordinate bases takes the form\nB\ng\u03b1\u03b2 = eA\n(3)\n\u03b1 e\u03b2 \u011dAB\neA\n\u03b1\n\nLet us now consider the normal vector of the hypersurface \u03a3 with respect\nto M\u0302 .It can be obtained, up to orietation, by solving the following equations:\n\u011d (\u2202\u03b1 , N) = 0 \u21d2 eA\n\u03b1 NA = 0\n\u011d (N, N) = \u03b5 = +1\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\nwhere we are admitting that the normal vector is spacelike (\u03b5 = +1, according to our convention). It follows from the injective condition of the\ndifferential map that the rank of eA\n\u03b1 is equal to the dimension of \u03a3, and as\na consequence there is only one (the number of the codimension) linearly\nindependent normal vector satisfying the above equations. Let us denote it\nby N.\n1\n\nHere we are adopting the following notation: a small bold letter, as for example v,\nrepresents a vector of the tangent space of M while a capital bold letter (V) corresponds\nto a vector of the tangent space of M\u0302 .\n2\nThroughout capital Latin indices take value in the range (0,1,...,n) while Greek indices\nrun from (0,1,...,n-1).\n3\nHere we are using the common notation \u2202A = \u2202y\u2202A and \u2202\u03b1 = \u2202x\u2202\u03b1 . We shall represent\nthe components of vectors with respect to these bases as v \u03b1 and V A , respectively.\n\n5\n\n\fIn the present formalism an important concept is that of a projection\ntensor \u03a0, which maps vectors V \u2208 Tp (M\u0302 ) onto the tangent space Tp (\u03a3) of\nthe hypersurface at p \u2208 \u03a3. We define \u03a0 by\n\u03a0 (V) = V \u2212 V \u22a5 N\n\n(6)\n\nwhere here we are using the following notation V \u22a5 = \u011d (V, N).\nIt is clear that \u03a0 (V) can be considered as a vector of Tp \u03a3. Therefore it\ncan be written in the basis {\u2202\u03b1 }. In particular, the projection of \u2202A \u2208 Tp M\u0302\ncan be written as \u03a0 (\u2202A ) = e\u03b1A \u2202\u03b1 , for some 'vielbein' e\u03b1A . As we shall see\nlater, e\u03b1A and eA\n\u03b1 are related. Using (6) we can write vector \u2202A as\n\u2202A = e\u03b1A \u2202\u03b1 + NA N\n\n(7)\n\nNote that this relation\n\u0010 \u0011is valid only at points of \u03a3, where {\u2202\u03b1 , N} constitute\na local basis of Tp M\u0302 .\n\nTo determine the relation between the vielbein functions e\u03b1A and eA\n\u03b1 let us\nconsider the vectors \u2202\u03b2 and \u2202A , and calculate\nproduct \u011d (\u2202\u03b2 , \u2202A ).\n\u0001 their inner\n\u03b1\nFrom (7) it is easy to see that \u011d eB\n\u2202\n,\n\u2202\n=\n\u011d\n(\u2202\n,\ne\n\u2202\n),\nwhich then shows\nA\n\u03b2 A \u03b1\n\u03b2 B\nthat\ne\u03b1A = \u011dAB g \u03b1\u03b2 eB\n(8)\n\u03b2\nNow let us turn our attention to the decomposition of an arbitrary vector\nV \u2208 Tp M\u0302. We have V = V A \u2202A and from (7) it may be written as a sum of\nparallel and orthogonal components with respect to the hypersurface \u03a3:\nV = V \u03b1 \u2202\u03b1 + V \u22a5 N\n\n(9)\n\nwhere V \u03b1 = e\u03b1A V A corresponds to the coordinates of the projected vector,\n\u03a0 (V), in the basis {\u2202\u03b1 }. It is also useful to express explicitly the relation\nbetween the components of the vector in the bases {\u2202A } and {\u2202\u03b1 , N}:\n\u03b1\n\u22a5 A\nV A = eA\n\u03b1V + V N\n\n(10)\n\nNow, with the help of the projection operator \u03a0, tensors fields of any\nrank can be decomposed with respect to the basis {\u2202\u03b1 , N} at points of \u03a3. In\nparticular, using (7), the second rank tensor T = T AB \u2202A \u2297 \u2202B can be written\nas\nT = T AB \u2202A \u2297 \u2202B = T \u03b1\u03b2 \u2202\u03b1 \u2297 \u2202\u03b2 + \u03c8 \u03b1 \u2202\u03b1 \u2297 N + \u03c7\u03b2 N \u2297 \u2202\u03b2 + \u03c6N \u2297 N (11)\n6\n\n\fwhere\nT \u03b1\u03b2 = e\u03b1A e\u03b2B T AB\n\n(12)\n\n\u03c8 \u03b1 = e\u03b1A NB T AB\n\n(13)\n\n\u03c7\u03b2 = e\u03b2B NA T AB\n\n(14)\n\n\u03c6 = NA NB T\n\nAB\n\n(15)\n\nNotice that the components T \u03b1\u03b2 are just the components of the projection of\nT with respect to the intrinsic coordinates basis {\u2202\u03b1 } of the tangent space of\nthe hypersurface \u03a3. Clearly, the components of T in both coordinate bases\nare related by the equation\nB \u03b1\u03b2\nB \u03b1\nA B \u03b2\nA B\nT AB = eA\n+ eA\n\u03b1 e\u03b2 T\n\u03b1 N \u03c8 + N e\u03b2 \u03c7 + N N \u03c6\n\n(16)\n\nWe now turn to the question of how differential operators acting on \u03a3\nand M\u0302 are related. Let D and \u2207 denote the covariant derivative relative to\nthe metrics \u011d and g respectively. In the case of an isometric embedding \u2207\ncorresponds to the induced covariant derivative [39]:\n\u2207w v = \u03a0 (Dw v)\n\n(17)\n\nwhere now v and w are two vectors fields of the tangent space of \u03a3. (It is\nimportant to note that in the expression Dw v, instead of v and w, we should\nconsider any extensions of these vector fields [39]).\nNow take w = \u2202\u03b2 and write v in the basis {\u2202A }. From (17) we obtain\nA\n\u2207\u03b2 v \u03b1 = e\u03b1A eB\n\u03b2 DB v\n\n(18)\n\nAnother important concept in the context of the embedding formalism\nis that of extrinsic curvature K, which can be defined from the orthogonal\ncomponents of the vector Dw v as\nK (v, w) \u2261 \u011d (Dw v, N) = \u2212\u011d (v, Dw N)\n\n(19)\n\n(The latter equality comes from the condition of compatibility between \u011d and\nthe covariant derivative D). It is easy to see that the extrinsic curvature is a\nsymmetric tensor whose components in the coordinates {\u2202\u03b1 } can be written\nas\nB\nK\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2212eA\n(20)\n\u03b1 e\u03b2 DB NA\n7\n\n\fNow let us consider the covariant derivative of the normal vectors N along\ntangent directions of \u03a3. Relatively to the basis {\u2202\u03b1 , N}, we find the following\ndecomposition:\nD\u03b2 N = \u2212K\u03b2\u03b1 \u2202\u03b1\n(21)\nNow we have all the necessary ingredients to analyze the decomposition of\nthe covariant derivative DB V of an arbitrary vector field V of the tangent\nspace M\u0302 . Using (7), we can split the covariant derivative in two terms: one\nrelated to derivative along the tangent directions of \u03a3 and the other one,\nrelated to the normal direction:\nDB V = e\u03b2B D\u03b2 V + NB D\u22a5 V\n\n(22)\n\nwhere we have introduced the following notation: D\u22a5 V = DN V. As the\nvector V itself can be also decomposed according to (9), then, the first term\non the right hand side of (22) gives\n\u0001\nD\u03b2 V = D\u03b2 (V \u03b1 \u2202\u03b1 ) + D\u03b2 V \u22a5 N\n(23)\nUsing (17), (19) and (21), it follows that\n\nD\u03b2 (V \u03b1 \u2202\u03b1 ) = \u2207\u03b2 (V \u03b1 \u2202\u03b1 ) + K\u03b1\u03b2 V \u03b1 N\n\u0001\nD\u03b2 V \u22a5 N = N\u2207\u03b2 V \u22a5 \u2212 V \u22a5 K\u03b2\u03b1 \u2202\u03b1\n\n(24)\n(25)\n\nTherefore, the derivative of the vector V along the tangent direction \u03a0 (\u2202B )\nhas the following components in the coordinates {\u2202A }:\n\b \u0002\n\u0003\n\u03b1\n\u03b1 \u22a5\ne\u03b2B D\u03b2 V A = e\u03b2B eA\n\u03b1 \u2207\u03b2 V \u2212 K\u03b2 V\n\u0002\n\u0003\n+N A \u2207\u03b2 V \u22a5 + K\u03b1\u03b2 V \u03b1\n(26)\n\nAs we have already mentioned, the second term in (22) corresponds to\nthe covariant derivative relative to the normal direction. Thus, collecting all\nterms, we find\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03b1\n\u22a5 \u03b1\nDB V A = e\u03b2B eA\n\u2207\nV\n\u2212\nV\nK\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03b2\nA\n\u22a5\n+ eB N \u2207\u03b2 V + K\u03b1\u03b2 V \u03b1 + NB D\u22a5 V A\n(27)\nIn similar manner we can obtain the decomposition of the covariant\nderivative of the tensor T = T AB \u2202A \u2297 \u2202B .

The higherdimensional equations shall be prescribed as a higher-dimensional generalization of the usual Maxwell equations. In this case, the field equations will\ninvolve the divergence of an anti-symmetric second order tensor which will\nplay the role of the electromagnetic field. Then, it is important to know how\nthe divergence of a tensor is treated in the present embedding formalism.\nSo let us take the contraction between the indices A and C in the covariant\n9\n\n\fderivative of the tensor T. In the local coordinates, we have:\nDA T AB = e\u03b3A D\u03b3 T AB + NA D\u22a5 T AB\n\n(35)\n\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\nA\nUsing the relation (34) and remembering that eA\n\u03b1 eA = \u03b4\u03b1 and eA N = 0, we\nfind:\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03b1\u03b2\nDA T AB = eB\n\u2212 \u03c8 \u03b1 K\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 \u03c7\u03b2 K\n\u03b2 \u2207\u03b1 T\n\u0002\n\u0003\n+ N B T \u03b1\u03b2 K\u03b3\u03b2 + \u2207\u03b1 \u03c8 \u03b1 \u2212 \u03c6K + NA D\u22a5 T AB\n(36)\n\nwhere K = K\u03b1\u03b1 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature. Considering the\nparallel and orthogonal projection of the vector DA T AB with respect to \u03a3,\nwe obtain, respectively:\n\u0001\nDA T AB e\u03b2B = \u2207\u03b1 T \u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 \u03c8 \u03b1 K\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 \u03c7\u03b2 K + W \u03b2\n(37)\n\u0001\nDA T AB NB = T \u03b1\u03b2 K\u03b1\u03b2 + \u2207\u03b1 \u03c8 \u03b1 \u2212 \u03c6K + Y\n(38)\n\u0001\n\u0001\nwhere W \u03b2 = D\u22a5 T AB NA e\u03b2B and Y = D\u22a5 T AB NA NB . It is interesting to\nnotice at this point that \u03c7\u03b1 , \u03c8 \u03b1 and W \u03b1 behave as vectors with respect to\nthe coordinates transformation of \u03a3, while \u03c6 and Y are scalar quantities.\n\n3\n\nThe induced electromagnetic equations on\nthe hypersurface\n\nIn this section we shall investigate how a higher-dimensional electrodynamics\ndefined on the manifold M\u0302 might induces four-dimensional electromagnetism\non the manifold \u03a3, (which we take to be the ordinary space-time). So, let\nAA be a higher-dimensional vector field, which we assume to play the role\nof a higher-dimensional vector potential defined on M\u0302 and let us consider its\nprojection onto the tangent space T (\u03a3) of \u03a3:\nA\u03b1 = e\u03b1A AA\n\n(39)\n\nWith the help of (3) and (39) it is not difficult to show that a gauge\ntransformation of the potential, AA \u2192 AA + \u011d AB \u2202B f , induces the gauge\ntransformation of the projected potential A\u03b1 \u2192 A\u03b1 + g \u03b1\u03b2 \u2202\u03b2 f.\nIn order to make contact with four-dimensional electrodynamics let us\nsuppose the existence, in addition to the projected potential A\u03b1 , of an \"intrinsic\" electromagnetic potential A\u03b1 confined to the spacetime and that\n10\n\n\fcould be measured by four-dimensional observers living on \u03a3. It is then reasonable to assume a kind of \"isometric\" condition for the potential holds,\ni.e., we assume that the intrinsic potential A\u03b1 should be identified to A\u03b1 .\nThat is\nA\u03b1 = A\u03b1 = e\u03b1A AA\n(40)\nIn analogy with four-dimensional electrodynamics the higher-dimensional\nelectromagnetic tensor FAB is defined as FAB = DA AB \u2212 DB AA , while the\nintrinsic four-dimensional electromagnetic tensor keeps its usual form F\u03b1\u03b2 =\n\u2207\u03b1 A\u03b2 \u2212 \u2207\u03b2 A\u03b1 . Let us now compare the projection of FAB relative to the\nsubmanifold \u03a3 with the \"intrinsic\" electromagnetic tensor F\u03b1\u03b2 . From (27)\nwe can calculate the covariant derivative of the higher-dimensional potential,\nwhich, projected into the hypersurface, gives:\nC\n\u22a5\n\u22a5\neB\n\u03b2 e\u03b3 DB AC = \u2207\u03b2 A\u03b3 \u2212 A K\u03b3\u03b2 = \u2207\u03b2 A\u03b3 \u2212 A K\u03b3\u03b2\n\n(41)\n\nNotice that the second equality is obtained from the 'isometric' condition\n(40), which allows us to substitute A\u03b3 by the intrinsic potential A\u03b3 . Using the\nabove equation and taking into account that the extrinsic curvature tensor\nof \u03a3 is symmetric it follows that\nB\nF\u03b1\u03b2 = eA\n\u03b1 e\u03b2 FAB = F\u03b1\u03b2\n\n(42)\n\nIn a geometric view of gauge theories we may regard the potential as playing the role of a connection, while the field tensor is the associated curvature\ntensor. Thus, the above condition relating the projected curvature and the\nintrinsic curvature may be viewed as the analogue of the Gauss equation\nwhich gives a relation of the Riemannian curvature tensors of the embedded\nmanifold and the ambient space.\nAt this point, let us admit that the electromagnetic field equations in M\u0302\nare given by a higher-dimensional version of the Maxwell equations, that is,\nlet us assume that the dynamics of AA is given by\nDA F AB = g 2 J B\n\n(43)\n\nwhere g 2 is the higher-dimensional coupling constant and J B is a higherdimensional electric density current that is supposed to satisfy the continuity\nequation DB J B = 0. The higher-dimensional field equation can be decomposed in parallel and orthogonal parts relatively to \u03a3 in much the same way\n11\n\n\fas was done in (36). Thus, using (36) and (42), the parallel projection yields\nthe induced field equations in terms of the intrinsic electromagnetic field F \u03b1\u03b2\n\u0001\n\u2207\u03b1 F \u03b1\u03b2 = g 2 J B e\u03b2B + \u03c8 \u03b1 K\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 K \u2212 W \u03b2\n(44)\n\u0001\nwhere W \u03b2 = D\u22a5 T AB NA e\u03b2B . Note that here we have used the antisymmetry of the tensor F AB , which allows us to write \u03c7\u03b1 = \u2212\u03c8 \u03b1 (see (13)\nand (14))\nThe sum of the terms on the right-hand side of the above equation, which\nbehaves as a vector field of \u03a3 with respect to the coordinates transformations\nof the hypersurface, appears in (44) as an effective density of current. It can\nbe checked that this induced current has the important property of being\ndivergenceless. It is also worthy of mention that the extrinsic curvature of the\nhypersurface contributes as a source of the four-dimensional electromagnetic\nfield.\nFinally, the orthogonal projection of the field equation (43) gives the\nfollowing constraint for the vector field \u03c8 \u03b1 :\n\u2207\u03b1 \u03c8 \u03b1 = g 2 J A NA\n\n4\n\n(45)\n\nExistence of embedded solutions of the induced equation\n\nAs we have already pointed out, this new formulation of the electromagnetism\nraises the fundamental question of whether all known solutions of the usual\nfour-dimensional Maxwell equations are contained in the induced equations.\nWe are going to consider this question here following an approach which bears\na close analogy with the formulation of the Campbell-Magaard embedding\ntheorem [14].\nLet A\u03b1 (x) be a given four-dimensional potential and p \u2208 \u03a3. We want to\nshow that there exists a solution AA (y) of the higher-dimensional Maxwell\nequations (43) and an open set U \u2282 \u03a3 containing the point p, such that\ne\u03b1A AA\n\nU\n\n= A\u03b1\n\n(46)\n\ni.e. the projection of the 5D-solution onto the tangent space T (\u03a3) of the\nhypersurface is equal to intrinsic potential A\u03b1 (x) given.\n\n12\n\n\fAs far as the existence of solutions is concerned there is no loss of generality if we admit that the field equations in the higher-dimensional space are\nthe sourceless Maxwell equations\nDA F AB = 0\n\n(47)\n\nNow, if we prove that it is possible to carry out an \"isometric embedding\" of any four-dimensional potential A\u03b1 into M\u0302 , then clearly we have\ndemonstrated that any arbitrary of four-dimensional (physical) current can\nbe simulated, or rather generated, by the embedding mechanism.\nLet us start the proof. Since F AB is an anti-symmetric tensor, it satisfies\nidentically, i.e. independent of any field equation, the condition:\nDB DA F AB = 0\n\n(48)\n\nUsing the expression (36) for the anti-symmetric tensor F AB we get the\nfollowing identity:\n\u0002\n\u0001\n\u0003\n\u03b1\u03b2\nDB eB\n\u2212 j \u03b2 + nB (\u2207\u03b1 \u03c8 \u03b1 ) = 0\n(49)\n\u03b2 \u2207\u03b1 F\nSince the equations (47) and (48) are prescribed in an open set of M\u0302 , then\nequation (49) must be also valid in M\u0302 . Therefore, in (49) we must interpret\nF \u03b1\u03b2 , j \u03b2 , nB , \u2207\u03b1 \u03c8 \u03b1 as extensions of these quantities which were originally defined in the hypersurface \u03a3. In the sequel we shall denote these extensions\nwith a bar. Now, an extension can be obtained by defining a foliation of M\u0302 .\nA foliation adapted to the embedding may be given by considering a family\nof functions f A (x, l) which depend on the coordinates of \u03a3 and on the extra\ncoordinate l, with the condition\nf A (x, 0) = \u03c6A (x)\n\n(50)\n\nwhere \u03c6A (x) is the original embedding map. If additionally we take f A (x, l)\nto be differentiable at p (at least with the same class of differentiability of\nM\u0302 ), then the set of equations\ny A = f A (x, l)\n\n(51)\n\nmay be regarded as a legitimate transformation of coordinates in a neighborhood of p; hence the set of variables {x, l} will constitute a coordinate\n13\n\n\fsystem in a neighborhood of p \u2208 M\u0302 . Clearly, each equation l = const defines\na hypersurface of M\u0302. In particular, l = 0 is the equation that defines the\nhypersurface \u03a3 by virtue of (50). Naturally the mathematical formalism developed previously is also applicable to any leaf (l = const) of the foliation,\nwith the simple change\nA\neA\n\u03b1 (x) \u2192 \u0113\u03b1 (x, l) =\n\n\u2202f A\n\u2202x\u03b1\n\n(52)\n\nThus, in equation (49) the projected quantities will also depend on the extra\ncoordinate l. When l = 0 they reduce to the original ones defined on the\nhypersurface \u03a3.\nNow if we admit that equation (44) holds in a neighborhood of p \u2208 M\u0302 ,\nthen equation (49) reduces to\n\u0001\n\u0001\n \u0304 \u03b1 \u03c8\u0304 \u03b1 \u2212 \u2207\n \u0304 \u03b1 \u03c8\u0304 \u03b1 DB n\u0304B = 0\n(53)\nn\u0304B DB \u2207\n\nThe above equation gives the propagation of \u2207\u03b1 \u03c8 \u03b1 along the normal direc \u0304 \u03b1 \u03c8\u0304 \u03b1 = 0\ntion. If \u2207\u03b1 \u03c8 \u03b1 = 0 in \u03a3, then clearly the unique solution of (53) is \u2207\nin a open set of M\u0302 . Therefore, as usual in gauge theories, there is a kind of\nconstraint equation, \u2207\u03b1 \u03c8 \u03b1 = 0, that is automatically propagated by the real\ndynamical field equations (44). We might say then that the field equations\nDA F AB = 0, defined in M\u0302 , is equivalent to\n \u0304 \u03b1 F\u0304 \u03b1\u03b2 = j\u0304 \u03b2\n\u2207\n\u2207\u03b1 \u03c8 \u03b1 = 0\n\nin M\u0302\nin \u03a3\n\n(54)\n(55)\n\nNow let us investigate the existence of solutions of (54). With this purpose\nlet us rewrite the above equation in a more convenient form. We begin by\nshowing that W\u0304 \u03b2 is the only term in equation (54) that involves the second\nderivative of the potential along the normal direction. In order to verify this\nwe rewrite W\u0304 \u03b2 as the following decomposition:\nW\u0304 \u03b2 = \u2212D\u22a5 \u03c8\u0304 \u03b2 \u2212 F\u0304 \u03b1\u03b2 a\u03b1 \u2212 \u03c8\u0304 \u03b1 \u0113\u03b2A \u03b8\u03b1A + \u03c8\u0304 \u03b1 K\u0304\u03b1\u03b2\n\n(56)\n\nwhere we define a\u03b1 = e\u03b1A D\u22a5 N A (acceleration of the normal vector N) and\n\u03b8\u03b1A = [N, \u2202\u03b1 ]A (the Lie derivative of N and the extended vector fields \u2202\u03b1 ).\nIt is clear that a\u03b1 and \u03b8\u03b1A depend on the foliation, which is assumed to be\nsufficiently smooth. Consider now the term D\u22a5 \u03c8\u0304 \u03b2 . Writing the normal vector\nin the coordinate basis {\u2202\u03b1 , \u2202l } and using (7), we can show that\n14\n\n\f\u03b2\n\nD\u22a5 \u03c8\u0304 = N \u03c8\u0304\nA\n\n\u03b2\n\n\u0001\n\n1\n=\nNA lA\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202 \u03c8\u0304 \u03b2\n\u2212 lA \u0113\u03b1A \u2202\u03b1 \u03c8\u0304 \u03b2\n\u2202l\n\n\u0013\n\n(57)\n\nwhere lA = \u2202f\u2202l . It turns out that \u03c8\u0304 \u03b2 already involves a normal derivative\nof the potential, as we can explicitly see by rewriting it as\n\u0001\n\u03c8\u0304 \u03b1 = g \u03b1\u03b3 \u2207\u03b3 A\u22a5 \u2212 D\u22a5 A\u03b3 + AC \u03b8\u03b3C\n(58)\nTherefore, as we have mentioned before, W\u0304 \u03b2 depends on the second\nderivative of A\u03b3 with respect to the coordinate l. If we isolate this term\nat the left-hand side, we can put the equation (54) in the following form:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202 2 A\u03b2\n\u2202A\u03b1\n= Q\u03b2 A\u03b1 ,\n, x, l\n(59)\n\u2202l2\n\u2202l\n\nwhere Q\u03b2 represent functions that are analytic with respect to all the arguments. It is important to bear in mind that the normal component of the\npotential N\u0304 A AA = A\u22a5 may be arbitrarily chosen and should be regarded as\na known analytical function.\nIt turns out that according to the Cauchy-Kowalewskaya theorem equation (59) admits analytic solutions and that these solutions are unique as\nlong as the initial conditions \u2202l A\u03b2 |\u03a3 and A\u03b1 |\u03a3 are specified [41]. Moreover,\nthe initial functions can be any arbitrary analytic functions. Thus, we might\nchoose A\u03b1 |\u03a3 = A\u03b1 , in order to satisfy the isometric embedding condition\n(40). In addition, we might select functions \u2202l A\u03b2 |\u03a3 that satisfy the constraint equation, whose solution always exists. Finally, with the solution of\n\u03b1\n\u22a5 A\nwhich\n(59), we are able to construct a 5D-potential AA = \u0113A\n\u03b1 A + A N\u0304\nclearly satisfies the vacuum 5D-Maxwell equations (47). This completes the\nproof that the set of all analytic solutions of the four-dimensional Maxwell\nequations is contained in the five-dimensional electromagnetism. This generalizes our previous study in this subject in which we have obtained the same\nresult investigating the solutions of the field equations in a flat ambient space\n[42].\n\n5\n\nThe effective field equations in a brane\n\nIn this section we are going to start by admitting that matter is localized\nin a brane \u03a3 by some confinement mechanism [24]. Our purpose here is to\n15\n\n\finvestigate the effects of the concentration of charges and currents on the\nfield equations for the electromagnetic field in the brane.\nThe confined 4D-current can be described by means of a Dirac delta\nfunction with support on the hypersurface. Using a foliation adapted to the\nembedding, like the foliation given in (51), the bulk current density J B can\nbe written as:\n\u03b2 \u03b4 (l)\nJ B = eB\n(60)\n\u03b2j\nNA lA\nwhere j \u03b2 describes the current density of the localized charges in \u03a3.\nIt is reasonable to expect that, by virtue of the concentration of the\nelectric charge in \u03a3, the first normal derivative of the bulk potential is discontinuous in \u03a3 and that the discontinuity through \u03a3 should depend on j \u03b2 .\nTo determine the amount of this jump, let us integrate the equation (54) in\nsome finite region of the bulk contained in the range p\n\u2212\u03b5 < l < \u03b5. Taking\ninto account that the 'volume' element of the bulk is |\u1e21|NA lA dldx1 ...dxn\n(in the coordinates adapted to the foliation) and isolating the source term\non the right-hand side, we obtain from (44):\nZ\n\n...\n\nZ\n\n\u2212\u03b5<l<\u03b5\n\n\b\u0002\n\nW\u0304 \u03b2 \u2212 \u03c8\u0304 \u03b1 K\u0304\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 K\u0304\n\n\u0001\u0003\n\n \u0304 \u03b1 F\u0304 \u03b1\u03b2\n+\u2207\n\np\n\n=g\n\n2\n\nZ\n\n|\u1e21|NA lA dldx1 ...dxn =\n...\n\nZ\n\nl=0\n\nj\u03b2\n\np\n\n|g|dx1 ...dxn (61)\n\nAll the terms inside the integral on the left hand side of equation (61)\nare bounded functions, except W\u0304 \u03b2 which contains a second derivative of the\nbulk potential with respect to the normal direction, as we have seen in the\nprevious section. Therefore W\u0304 \u03b2 might contain a singular distribution. Now\ntaking the limit \u03b5 \u2192 0, we find, using (56) and (57), that the equation (61)\nyields\n\u0002 \u03b2\u0003\n\u03c8 = \u2212g 2 j \u03b2\n(62)\n\u0002 \u03b2\u0003\nwhere \u03c8 = \u03c8 \u03b2 (l \u2192 0+ ) \u2212 \u03c8 \u03b2 (l \u2192 0\u2212 ). If we admit, as usual, that the\nbrane has Z2 reflection symmetry then it is reasonable to assume that \u03c8 \u03b1 is\nanti-symmetric with respect to \u03a3. Thus it follows that\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\u03c8(0\n+ ) = \u2212\u03c8(0\u2212 ) = \u2212\n\n16\n\ng2 \u03b2\nj\n2\n\n(63)\n\n\fNow remember that the extrinsic curvature is related to the matter content\nin the brane according to the equation4 :\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n+\n\u2212\nK\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212K\u03bc\u03bd = G5 S\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd S\n(64)\n2\n3\nwhere the 4D-energy-momentum tensor S\u03bc\u03bd can be written as a sum of two\nterms: one related to the tension of the brane and the other corresponding\nto the ordinary energy distribution in the brane\nS\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212\u03bbg\u03bc\u03bd + \u03c4\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(65)\n\nIt is interesting to notice that \u03c8 \u03b2 and K\u03bc\u03bd are not well defined in the brane,\nsince they assume different values in \u03a3 as we approach the hypersurface from\nabove (l > 0) or from bellow (l < 0). However, the product \u03c8 \u03b2 K\u03bc\u03bd is well\ndefined in the brane. Hence the equation (44) gives a well defined equation\nfor the electromagnetic tensor F \u03b1\u03b2 in \u03a3 when we take the limit l \u2192 0:\n1\n1\n\u03b2\n\u2207\u03b1 F \u03b1\u03b2 = g 2 G5 \u03bbj \u03b2 \u2212 g 2 G5 j \u03b1 \u03c4\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 Wreg\n4\n4\n\n(66)\n\n\u03b2\nwhere Wreg\nis the regular part of W\u0304 \u03b2 , which is obtained in the limit. Thus\nwe can consider that equation (66) represents the effective equation which\ngoverns the electromagnetic field as seen by 4D-observers. Of course (66)\nmust fulfill an important requirement if it is to be considered a good field\nequation in the brane. It should be equivalent to the Maxwell equations in\nthe low-energy regime in order to be consistent with the successful description\nof the electromagnetic phenomena by the 4D-Maxwell equations. As direct\nconsequence of this requirement, it is necessary that the unknown coupling\nconstants must obey the constraint g 2 G5 \u03bb = 4e2 . It follows then that the\neffective equations assume the form\n\n\u2207\u03b1 F \u03b1\u03b2 = e2 j \u03b2 \u2212\n\ne2 \u03b1 \u03b2\n\u03b2\nj \u03c4\u03b1 \u2212 Wreg\n\u03bb\n\n(67)\n\nIt is obvious that, compared to the Maxwell equations, the effective equations\nhave two additional terms which contribute as sources of the electromagnetic\nfield. Let us make some comments on the interpretation of these terms and\nestimate their order of magnitude.\n4\n\nThe positive sign is in accordance with our definition of the extrinsic curvature tensor\n\n(19)\n\n17\n\n\fIt is generally accepted that the the order of the brane tension \u03bb is much\ngreater than the energy scale of the ordinary matter whose distribution is\ndescribed by \u03c4\u03bc\u03bd . So the second term is very small compared to the first one\nin the low-energy regime. Despite of its tiny effects in the ordinary energy\nscale, let us try to understand how it works. From the point of view of\n2\n4D-observers, the origin of e\u03bb j \u03b1 \u03c4\u03b1\u03b2 might be connected to a unusual coupling\nbetween charges and fields (including the electromagnetic field itself since \u03c4\u03bc\u03bd\nalso contains the energy distribution of the electromagnetic field produces\nby j \u03b2 ). In a sense, this term behaves as a kind of medium polarization, but\nwith uncommon features. It does not vanishes even when there is no medium\nat all and the charges are just spread in the vacuum. Another peculiarity\nis the fact that\u0001 its effects are restricted to the region where the source is\npresent j \u03b2 6= 0 . To make more precise this interpretation, let us write the\ndensity current as j \u03b2 = \u03c10 U \u03b2 , where \u03c10 is the proper charge density and U \u03b2\ncorresponds to the quadrivelocity of the charges (U a U\u03b1 = \u22121). Taking the\n2\ninner product with U\u03b2 , we can see that the term e\u03bb j \u03b1 \u03c4\u03b1\u03b2 produces a change\nin the effective value of the charge of the source in a very similar way of a\ngenuine polarization. Indeed, we find\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0010\nu\u0011\n1 \u03b1 \u03b2\n\u03b2\n(68)\n\u03c1ef f = \u2212U\u03b2 j \u2212 j \u03c4\u03b1 = \u03c10 1 +\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\nwhere u = \u03c4 \u03b1\u03b2 U\u03b1 U\u03b2 is the energy density as measured by a co-moving inertial frame relative to the charges. If equation (67) does not allow solutions\nwith negative energy distribution, then we can conclude that due to the 'polarization' the effective charge appears to be greater than the real charge.\nTherefore, this  \u0301polarization' has an opposite sign in comparison with a\ncommon polarization of a material medium.\n\u03b2\nThe third term is a vector field Wreg\n, which might not be put in correspondence with any known field by the 4D-observers. The reason is that it\ndepends on the behavior of the gauge field in the vicinity of \u03a3. However,\nroughly speaking, it could be considered as the effect of a strange vacuum\npolarization in the brane, although this vacuum polarization would have no\nconnection with the quantum fluctuation of the vacuum. Now let us estimate\n\u03b2\nthe magnitude of Wreg\n. As we shall see it requires a more careful examination. First, taking the divergence of the effective equation, we find that W \u03b2\nsatisfies the condition\ne2\n\u03b2\n\u2207\u03b2 Wreg\n= \u2212 \u03c4\u03b1\u03b2 \u2207\u03b2 j \u03b1\n(69)\n\u03bb\n18\n\n\fIt is clear that the divergence of W \u03b2 has the same order of the second term in\nequation (67) and, thus can be neglected when compared to e2 j \u03b1 . However,\nthe divergenceless part of W \u03b2 cannot be estimated by 4D-observers. This is\nbecause the induced equations do not constitute a complete set of equations\nfor the 4D-fields. They can be solved only if they are considered as part\nof the five-dimensional field equations. However, some analyses regarding\nspecific geometric configurations show that the term cannot be discarded,\nand, as consequence the 4D-Green function cannot be recovered in the brane\nat low-energy regime [30, 31].\nThis negative result gives a clear indication that massless vectors fields\ncannot be localized in the hypersurface by means of gravity in this scenario.\nHowever, as we have already mentioned there are some alternative models\nwhich propose other different ways to guarantee the localization of massless\ngauge field. Here we want to concentrate our discussion on the DGP model.\nAccording to DGP model, the interaction between bulk gauge fields and\nlocalized matter in the brane induces corrections in the original Lagrangean\ndue to quantum effects. It is argued that these additional terms represent\ninteractions which are already four-dimensional. For example, in the case\nof electromagnetism, the total Lagrangean gains an extra term which is exactly e12 F\u03b1\u03b2 F \u03b1\u03b2 , the usual 4D-electromagnetic Lagrangean, restricted to the\nworld volume of the brane [38]. Of course, the presence of this extra term\nwill modify the field equations. Let us see that this alteration is easily implemented within our formalism. Indeed, as we have mentioned F\u03b1\u03b2 F \u03b1\u03b2 is\nalready confined to the brane, as the original source j \u03b2 . Thus, F\u03b1\u03b2 F \u03b1\u03b2 can\nbe readily incorporated into the field equations if we take it as part of the\nbulk current J B . Thus the new bulk current now becomes:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u03b4 (l)\nB\nB\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\u03b2\nJ = e\u03b2 j \u2212 2 \u2207\u03b1 F\n(70)\ne\nNA lA\nFollowing the previous procedure, it can be readily seen that the discontinuity\nof the \u03c8\u0304 \u03b2 through \u03a3 is now given by:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0002 \u03b2\u0003\n1\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\u03b2\n2\n(71)\n\u03c8 = \u2212g j \u2212 2 \u2207\u03b1 F\ne\nTaking the equation (44) in the limit l \u2192 0 and admitting the reflection\nsymmetry again we obtain the effective field equation in the brane in DGP\n\n19\n\n\fscenario:\n\u001a\u0012\n\u0013\n\u001b\n1 g 2 \u03bbG5\n1 g 2 G5 \u03b2\n1 2\n1 2\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\u03b3\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n1+\n\u03b4\n\u2212\n\u2207\nF\n=\n\u03c4\ng\n\u03bbG\nj\n\u2212\ng G5 j \u03b1 \u03c4\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 Wreg\n\u03b1\n5\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\n2\n2\n4 e\n4 e\n4\n4\n(72)\nAs in the previous case, in order that equation (72) can give an appropriate low-energy limit, it is necessary that the coupling constant be constraint\naccording to this formula\ng 2 \u03bbG5 = 4\u03c3e2\n(73)\nwhere \u03c3 is some dimensionless constant (in our units). Substituting this\nconstraint into the (72), the effective field equations assume the following\nform:\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03c3e2 \u03b2\n\u03c3e2\n1\n\u03c3\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\u03c4\u03b3 \u2207\u03b1 F \u03b1\u03b3 =\nj \u2212\nj \u03b1 \u03c4\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212\nW\u03b2\n\u03b4\u03b3 \u2212\n(1 + \u03c3) \u03bb\n(1 + \u03c3)\n(1 + \u03c3) \u03bb\n(1 + \u03c3) reg\n(74)\nThere are two terms that depend on the brane tension \u03bb directly. As we\nhave pointed out before, they are very small compared to first term (e2 j \u03b2 )\n\u03b2\nat the ordinary scale of energy. So let us focus our analysis on Wreg\n. Our\nfirst remark is that now, in the DGP scenario, the vector field is constrained.\nIndeed, comparing equation (71) and (74), we find that:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 \u03b2 e2 \u03b3\n\u03b2\n2 \u03b2\n\u03b2\nWreg = \u2212e j + (1 + \u03c3) \u03b4\u03b3 \u2212 \u03c4\u03b3\n[\u03c8 ]\n(75)\n2\u03bb\ng2\nThis equation shows that there is now two different characteristic parameters:\nthe brane tension \u03bb and the electromagnetic coupling constant g 2 . We have\nalready investigated the limit of the effective equations in comparison with\nthe energy scale of \u03bb. Now let us consider the other parameter g 2 . If we\nadmit that the lenght scale (G5 \u03bb)\u22121 is much smaller than rc \u2261 g 2/e2 , which\nis the most interesting case, then, in the low-energy limit (compared to the\nbrane tension), the above equation reduces to\n\u03b2\nWreg\n= \u2212e2 j \u03b2 + (1 + \u03c3)\n\ne2 \u0002 \u03b2 \u0003\n\u03c8\ng2\n\n(76)\n\nBy the definition of W \u03b2 and \u03c8 \u03b2 , we can conclude from (76), that the solution (the bulk potential) will depend on the parameter\ng 2 ,ii.e., A\u03b2 (x, l, g 2 ).\nh\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2212n\nNow if the dependence on g 2 is such that \u03c8 \u03b2 \u223c O (g 2 ) , where n > \u22121,\n20\n\n\for even logarithmic, then for large values of g 2 , we have approximately\n\u03b2\nWreg\n= \u2212e2 j \u03b2 (x), (remember that j \u03b2 (x) does not depend on g 2 ). It follows then, from (74), that Maxwell equations will be recovered in the brane\nin the range (G5 \u03bb)\u22121 << r << rc .\nHowever,\u0002 for\u0003 large distance compared to rc , it is reasonable to think that\nthe term r1c \u03c8 \u03b2 becomes more relevant, and hence the electromagnetic field\nin the brane in that domain will deviate significantly from its usual behavior\nin four-dimensional spacetime. In other words, the five-dimensional character\nof the fundamental electromagnetic field will be appreciable at large distance\ncompared to the scale established by the parameter rc . It is well known\nthat long range effects are connected to low frequency modes. Therefore, the\ndeviation of the four-dimensional behavior is interpreted as a consequence\nof the leakage of infrared modes of the field to the extra dimension. This\neffect is known as infrared transparency and it is a characteristic feature of\nthe DGP model.\n\n6\n\nFinal remarks\n\nOriginally the DGP model was conceived to deal with the issue of localization of gravitons in brane worlds. According to this model, the Newtonian\ngravitational potential can be recovered in a brane even if the brane is embedded in a bulk with flat extra dimension. The key element, as the authors\nrealized, is the fact that matter localized in the brane interacting with bulk\ngauge fields gives rise to a kinetic term for the gauge fields which is constrained to the world volume of the brane. Soon afterwards, this scheme was\napplied to other gauge interactions as a generic mechanism of localization of\nmassless gauge fields. A curious feature of the DGP model is that deviation\nof the four-dimensional behavior of the localized field will be manifest at\nultra-large distance.\nIn this paper we have considered an extended version of DGP braneworld\nscenario and investigated the question of how the electromagnetism is described in the brane. Using a covariant embedding formalism, we have found\nthe effective field equations that dictated the behavior of the electromagnetism field as seen from 4D-observers. The adopted formulation here seems\nto have some advantages over some other approaches: First, it allows us to\ntreat the issue with great generality since we do not put restrictions on the\ngeometry of neither the bulk nor the brane. Second, based on a covariant\n21\n\n\fformulation, the interpretation of the terms that appear in the effective field\nequations are independent of coordinates choices.\nIn order to keep the maximum generality we have also considered branes\nwhose tension is not necessarily null. Hence, the effective field equations\nhave two parameter which establish two different length scales. Finally, we\nhave determined the condition under which the effective field equations can\nrecover Maxwell equations.\n\n7\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nThe authors would like to thank CNPq-FAPESQ (PRONEX) for financial\nsupport.\n\nReferences\n[1] Nima Arkani-Hamed, Savas Dimopoulos, G.R.
