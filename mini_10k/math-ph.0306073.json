The power-law rheology is one of the\nsimplest generalizations of the Newtonian one, in which the effective viscosity \u03b7\nat a point is assumed to be a function of the local rate of deformation \u03b3\u0307 given\nby \u03b7 = m|\u03b3\u0307|1/\u03bb\u22121 . The values of m and \u03bb depend on the physical properties of\nthe liquid. When \u03bb > 1 the viscosity tends to zero at high strain rates [8] and\nis larger at low strain rates (these fluids are called shear-thinning).\nIn [10, 6] the following equation for one dimensional motion was derived\nusing the lubrication approximation:\nut + (u\u03bb+2 |uxxx |\u03bb\u22121 uxxx )x = 0.\n\n(1)\n\nwhere u(x, t) represents the thickness of the one-dimensional liquid film at position x and time t. In [1] a generalized version of (1) was studied by means\nof asymptotic and perturbative techniques in order to construct approximate\nsolutions representing the spreading of a droplet.

This is done in section 2. In section 3 we indicate the changes needed\nto deal with radially symmetric self-similar solutions (Eqs. (7-8)). Finally, in\nan Appendix we study the traveling wave solutions of (1) and classify all the\npossible behaviors of moving fronts close to the interface.\n\n2\n\nAnalysis of one dimensional self-similar solutions\n\nIn order to remove the parameter \u03ba from the initial condition we introduce the\nchange of variables\n\u221a\nx = \u03b7 \u03ba.\n(9)\nThen z(x, \u03b3) = U (\u03b7) satisfies\nz 1+a z \u2032\u2032\u2032 = \u03b3xa\nz(0) = 1, z \u2032(0) = 0, z \u2032\u2032 (0) = \u22121,\n\n(10)\n\n\u03b3 = k \u2212(3+1/\u03bb)/2\n\n(11)\n\nwith\nand\na = 1/\u03bb < 1.\nIn the following subsections we prove:\nTheorem 1 For each a \u2208 (0, 1) there exists a \u03b3 = \u03b3(a) and y = y(a) such\nthat z(x, \u03b3(a)) first reaches z = 0 for x = y(a) and z \u2032 (y(a), \u03b3(a)) = 0. The\nfunction z(x, \u03b3(a)) satisfying these conditions is unique.\nTheorem 2 Given a \u2208 (0, 1) and \u03b8 \u2208 (0, 1) there exist \u03b3 = \u03b3\u03b8\u221aand y = y\u03b8\nsuch that z(x, \u03b3\u03b8 ) first reaches z = 0 for x = y\u03b8 and z \u2032 (y\u03b8 , \u03b3\u03b8 ) = \u2212 2\u03b8.\nThese results are physically meaningful, because they imply that for \u03bb > 1\nthere exist solutions describing one-dimensional drops with fronts advancing at\nfinite speed. This result contrasts with the Newtonian case \u03bb = 1, where such\nsolutions do not exist [3].\nWe also show that source-type self-similar solutions cannot exist for \u03bb \u2264 1.\nAll these results were suggested by numerical calculations in [6] and asymptotic analysis in [6, 10].\nIn an appendix we will show, by studying traveling wave solutions, that the\nlocal behaviors of moving fronts near the interface are just those described in\nTheorems 1 and 2.\n3\n\n\f2.1\n\nGeneral Properties of Solutions.\n\nWe consider the initial value problem\nz 1+a z \u2032\u2032\u2032 = \u03b3xa\n\n(12)\n\nz(0) = 1, z \u2032(0) = 0, z \u2032\u2032 (0) = \u22121,\nwhere a \u2265 0 is fixed and \u03b3 \u2208 R is a parameter. We are interested in finding those\nvalues of \u03b3 for which there are interfaces, i.e., such that the solution z = z(x, \u03b3)\nhas a zero for a finite value of x and \u03b3.\nIf \u03b3 = 0 then the non-trivial solution to (12) is\nz(x, 0) = 1 \u2212\n\nx2\n2\n\n(13)\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwhich decreases from 1 to 0 as x increases from 0 to 2. The interface is x = 2.\nIf \u03b3 < 0 then the first three x-derivatives of z(x, \u03b3) are negative whenever z >\n0. Thus z is a decreasing function of x as long as z is positive. Moreover, z \u2032\u2032\u2032 < 0\nand the initial conditions imply that z(x, \u03b3) < z(x, 0) for x > 0. Physically, the\ncase \u03b3 < 0 represents retracting, dewetting drops.\nIf \u03b3 > 0 then z(x, \u03b3) > z(x, 0) for x > 0. Moreover, z \u2032 (x, \u03b3) < 0 at least for\nall sufficiently small x > 0. Either z \u2032 (x, \u03b3) < 0 for all x such that z(x, \u03b3) > 0\nor else there exists a \u03b6 > 0 such that z(x, \u03b3) decreases on (0, \u03b6) and achieves\na minimum at x = \u03b6 with z(x,\u03b3) \u2208 (0, 1). At x = \u03b6 we have z \u2032 (\u03b6, \u03b3) = 0 and\nz \u2032\u2032 (\u03b6, \u03b3) \u2265 0. Since z \u2032\u2032\u2032 > 0 it follows that z \u2032\u2032 (x, \u03b3) > 0 and z \u2032 (x, \u03b3) > 0 for all\nx > \u03b6. Therefore if z is not everywhere decreasing for z > 0 then z has a unique\nminimum at some x = \u03b6 > 0 with\n0 < z(\u03b6, \u03b3) < z(x, \u03b3) < 1, z \u2032 (x, \u03b3) < 0 for x \u2208 (0, \u03b6)\nand\nz(\u03b6, \u03b3) < z(x, \u03b3), z \u2032 (x, \u03b3) > 0 for x \u2208 (\u03b6, \u221e).\n\n2.2\n\nLocal Expansions Near the Interface\n\nThere are two different asymptotic expansions for the solution near the root\nz(y, \u03b3) = 0: one represents solutions with finite contact angle,\nz(x, \u03b3) =\n\n\u221a\n2\u03b8(y \u2212 x) +\n\n\u03b3y a\n2\n\n1+a\n2\n\n\u03b81+a a(1 \u2212 a)(2 \u2212 a)\n\n(y \u2212 x)2\u2212a + lower order terms\n(14)\n\nwhere \u03b8 \u2208 (0, 1), and another with zero contact angle\nz(x, \u03b3) =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b3(2 + a)3\n3a(1 \u2212 a)(1 + 2a)\n\n\u00131/(2+a)\n\ny a/(2+a) (y\u2212x)3/(2+a) +lower order terms.\n(15)\n4\n\n\fIt is simple to show the nonexistence of local expansions near the interface\nif a \u2265 1 and \u03b3 > 0. If a \u2265 1 and \u03b3 \u2264 0, then the local expansion is given by\n(14).\nWe can write formal representation formulae for the solution to (12).

As we observed above, any positive local minimum of z(x, \u03b3) is in\nfact a unique global minimum. Thus if z has a positive minimum, then z does\nnot have an interface. Suppose z has a positive minimum at x = x0 .

In the next subsection we study the limit as \u03b4 \u0581 0. We\nbegin by studying (a) in the neighborhood of the solution (13) for small |\u03b3|.\nWe have\nz(y1 (\u03b4), 0) = \u03b4 and z \u2032 (y1 (\u03b4), 0) = \u2212y1 (\u03b4) < 0,\np\nwhere y1 (\u03b4) = 2(1 \u2212 \u03b4). Since z(x, \u03b3) is smooth for z > 0, by the Implicit\nFunction Theorem there exists a smooth function y(\u03b3, \u03b4) for sufficiently small\n|\u03b3| such that\ny(0, \u03b4) = y1 (\u03b4) and z(y(\u03b3, \u03b4), \u03b3) = \u03b4.\ny(\u03b3, \u03b4) exists for all \u03b3 such that\nz \u2032 (y(\u03b3, \u03b4), \u03b3) < 0.\n\n(24)\n\nAs we observed above, (24) holds for all \u03b3 \u2264 0. Moreover, since (24) holds for\n\u03b3 = 0, and since y(\u03b3, \u03b4) depends smoothly on \u03b3 and z (y, \u03b3) depends smoothly\non y it follows that (24) continues to hold for all sufficiently small \u03b3 > 0.\nDifferentiating (23) with respect to \u03b3 we find\nz \u2032 (y, \u03b3)\nTherefore\n\n\u2202y\n+ z\u03b3 (y, \u03b3) = 0.\n\u2202\u03b3\n\n\u2202y\nz\u03b3 (y1 (\u03b4), 0)\nI2 (y1 (\u03b4), 0)\n|\u03b3=0 = \u2212 \u2032\n= p\n>0\n\u2202\u03b3\nz (y1 (\u03b4), 0)\n2(1 \u2212 \u03b4)\n\nso that y is an increasing function of \u03b3 at least for |\u03b3| small.\n\n2.4\n\nEstimates for solutions with interfaces\n\nWe now investigate the maximal \u03b3-interval of existence for the functions y(\u03b3, \u03b4)\nconstructed above. In the limit as \u03b4 \u2192 0 this will lead to solutions with zero\ncontact angle.\nIn view of (24) we define\n\u03b30 (\u03b4) \u2261 sup {\u03b3 > 0 : z \u2032 (y(\u03b3, \u03b4), \u03b3) < 0}\nand\ny0 (\u03b4) \u2261\n\nlim\n\n\u03b3\u0580\u03b30 (\u03b4)\n\n6\n\ny(\u03b3, \u03b4).\n\n\fNote that since z \u2032 (y, \u03b3) and y(\u03b3, \u03b4) are continuous we have\nz(y0 (\u03b4), \u03b30 (\u03b4)) = \u03b4 and z \u2032 (y0 (\u03b4), \u03b30 (\u03b4)) = 0.\nWe now derive some estimates for \u03b30 (\u03b4) and y0 (\u03b4).\nLemma 2.

Since a < 1 it follows that\nh(\u03b71\u2212 ) = 0.\nIf h(0) \u2264 0 then h decreasing and h(\u03b71\u2212 ) = 0 imply that h \u2261 0 on [0, \u03b71 ].\nThus\n1\ne \u2212s \u2212 U \u2212s )(U\ne2 \u2212 U1 ) = 0 on [0, \u03b71 )\nh\u2032 = \u03be \u03bb (U\n2\n1\n\ne2 = U1 on [0, \u03b71 ).

Together with h(\u03b71\u2212 ) = 0 and the fact that h is\ndecreasing this implies that h \u2265 0 on [0, \u03b71 ].

Using the asymptotic expansion (15) we can\nconclude that there exists an interval (\u03b72 , \u03b71 ) where V (\u03b7) and V \u2032\u2032 (\u03b7) have a\ngiven sign and, moreover, V (\u03b7)V (\u03b7)\u2032\u2032 > 0 in that interval.\nLet \u03b71\u2212 be a point of the interval sufficiently close to \u03b71 . Let \u03b7 \u2217 be the\ninflection point closest to \u03b71 . Given the regularity of V , since V \u2032\u2032 (0) < 0,\nV (0) > 0 and V (\u03b7)V (\u03b7)\u2032\u2032 > 0 for \u03b7 \u2208 (\u03b72 , \u03b71 ) such a point must exist and\nV \u2032\u2032 (\u03b7 \u2217 ) = 0.\nWe will show that V (\u03b7 \u2217 )V (\u03b71\u2212 ) > 0 for \u03b7 \u2217 < \u03b71\u2212 . The proof applies to\nthe case in which V (\u03b71\u2212 ) > 0 (the proof in the case V (\u03b71\u2212 ) < 0 is analogous).\nSuppose that V (\u03b7 \u2217 ) < 0. This implies the existence of some point \u03b7 \u2217\u2217 \u2208 (\u03b7 \u2217 , \u03b71 )\nat which a local maximum of V is achieved and V \u2032\u2032 (\u03b7 \u2217\u2217 ) < 0. Hence there must\nexist and inflection point in (\u03b7 \u2217\u2217 , \u03b71 ) which contradicts the fact that \u03b7 \u2217 is the\ninflection point closest to \u03b71 .\nSince V \u2032\u2032 (\u03b7 \u2217 ) is negative for \u03b7 \u2208 (\u03b7 \u2217 \u2212 \u03b5, \u03b7 \u2217 ) and positive for \u03b7 \u2208 (\u03b7 \u2217 , \u03b7 \u2217 + \u03b5)\nd\nwe have that V V \u2032\u2032 is increasing at \u03b7 \u2217 and hence d\u03b7\n(V V \u2032\u2032 )\n= V (\u03b7 \u2217 )V \u2032\u2032\u2032 (\u03b7 \u2217 ) +\n\u03b7\u2217\n\nV \u2032 (\u03b7 \u2217 )V \u2032\u2032 (\u03b7 \u2217 ) = V (\u03b7 \u2217 )V \u2032\u2032\u2032 (\u03b7 \u2217 ) \u2265 0 and V \u2032 (\u03b7 \u2217 )V (\u03b7 \u2217 ) < 0.

In the interval (0, \u03b71 ) there must exists a local\nmaximum \u03b72 for V and we can repeat the argument of the previous case looking\nfor an inflection point at the left of \u03b72 instead of \u03b71 .\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper we have established the existence of solutions representing the\nspreading of drops in a model for the capillary spreading of Non-Newtonian\nfluids of power-law rheology. The solutions depend on the rheology exponent \u03bb.\nHere we prove that when \u03bb > 1 then for a given mass of fluid, there exists only\none solution with zero contact angle at the horizontal substrate and infinitely\nmany solutions with a finite contact angle. Both the spreading rate and the\nheight of the drop are power laws whose respective exponents depend on \u03bb. For\nthe case when \u03bb < 1 such spreading solutions do not exist. Both results are\nvalid for both planarly and radially symmetric drops.\nThe results presented here pose a number of interesting questions:\n1. Does these solutions represent the intermediate asymptotics of the spreading of a compactly supported drop?. In other words, does the solution as\nt \u2192 \u221e depend on the initial shape of the drop?.\n13\n\n\f2. Is there a selection criterion between zero and non-zero contact angle\nsolutions?. This is perhaps an stability problem that can be recast in\nthe following way: which of these solutions is stable with respect to small\nperturbations of the initial data?.\n\n5\n\nAppendix: the traveling wave solutions in 1-D\n\nIn this section we study the existence and asymptotic behavior of traveling wave\nsolutions. These solutions are relevant, since they allow the determination of\nthe local behavior of moving fronts near the interface. They are of the form\nu(x, t) = f (x + ct) .\n\n(36)\n\nSubstituting (36) in (1) we get the equation\ncf + f \u03bb+2 |f\u03be\u03be\u03be |\u03bb\u22121 f\u03be\u03be\u03be = K\n\n(37)\n\nwhere K is a real constant. The condition (2) forces us to choose K = 0. Since\n|f\u03be\u03be\u03be |\u03bb\u22121 f\u03be\u03be\u03be = \u2212cf \u22121\u2212\u03bb\none has that f\u03be\u03be\u03be > 0 if c < 0 and f\u03be\u03be\u03be < 0 if c > 0. Therefore,\n1\n\n1\n\n|f\u03be\u03be\u03be | = |c| \u03bb f \u22121\u2212 \u03bb .\n1\n\nand we can remove the factor |c| \u03bb by performing the change of variable f \u2192\n1\n|c| 2\u03bb+1 f . Given the translation and \u03be \u2192 \u2212\u03be reflection invariance of the equation we can assume without loss of generality that the solutions representing\nfronts are defined for \u03be \u2265 0 and the front is located at \u03be = 0. We will also\nassume f\u03be\u03be\u03be < 0 and arrive to\n1\n\nf\u03be\u03be\u03be = \u2212f \u22121\u2212 \u03bb .\n\n(38)\n\nLet us define\nx=f\ny = f \u2212\u03b1 f\u03be\nz = f \u03b2 f\u03be\u03be\nwith \u03b1 =\n\n\u03bb\u22121\n3\u03bb\n\nand \u03b2 =\n\n\u03bb+2\n3\u03bb\n\ntogether with the change of variable defined by\nx\u2212(\u03b2+\u03b1) d\u03be = d\u03be1\n\n(39)\n\nso that the solutions of (38) are orbits of the following third order autonomous\ndynamical system:\nx\u2032 = xy\n\n(40)\n2\n\n\u2032\n\ny = z \u2212 \u03b1y\nz \u2032 = \u22121 + \u03b2yz\n14\n\n(41)\n(42)\n\n\fFigure 1: The phase plane for (41), (42)\nNotice that equations (41), (42) are uncoupled to equation (40) so that the\nproblem reduces to the analysis of the phase plane for equations (41), (42).\n1\n2\n\u22121\nThere exists a unique equilibrium point at P : (y, z) = ((\u03b2\u03b1) 3 , \u03b1 3 \u03b2 \u2212 3 ).\nThis point is a saddle point as one can easily check. Hence, there exists an\nstable manifold \u03a31 through P as well as an unstable manifold \u03a32 . \u03a31 consists\non the union of two separatrices \u03931 , \u03932 and \u03a32 on the union of another two\nseparatrices \u03933 , \u03934 (see figure 1). There exist four different asymptotic behaviors\nfor the trajectories as |y| tends to infinity and each of these asymptotic behaviors\ncorresponds to the one exhibited by \u03931 , \u03932 , \u03933 , \u03934 respectively.

Every manifold of the form R \u00d7 \u0393 with \u0393 being a trajectory in the phase plane, is invariant.\nAs we will see, the most interesting case corresponds to \u0393 = \u0393i (i = 1, 2, 3, 4).\nThe invariant manifolds \u03a0i \u2261 R \u00d7 \u0393i intersect at the points R \u00d7 P which form\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\n\n1\n\n2\n\nthe trajectory (x, y, z) = (e(\u03b2\u03b1) 3 \u03be1 , (\u03b2\u03b1) 3 , \u03b1 3 \u03b2 \u2212 3 ). The behavior of the trajectories on \u03a0i (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) are rather different. The trajectories in \u03a01 and\n\u03a02 approach asymptotically R \u00d7 P as x \u2192 +\u221e. From equations (40), (41) and\nthe asymptotic behavior computed in formula (43) it follows that y \u2243 Kx\u2212\u03b1\nas x \u2192 0+ (K an arbitrary positive constant) for the trajectories in \u03a01 . Analogously, from equations (40), (41) and the asymptotic behavior computed in\n\u03b2\nformula (44) it follows that y \u2243 Kx 2 when y \u2192 \u2212\u221e (K an arbitrary negative\nconstant) for the trajectories in \u03a02 . The trajectories in \u03a03 and \u03a04 start at\n1\n2\n1\n(x, y, z) = (0, (\u03b2\u03b1)\u2212 3 , \u03b1 3 \u03b2 \u2212 3 ). Analogously to the trajectories in \u03a02 and \u03a01 ,\n\u03b2\nthe trajectories in \u03a03 are such that y \u2243 Kx 2 when x \u2192 \u221e (K an arbitrary\nnegative constant) and the trajectories in \u03a04 are such that y \u2243 Kx\u2212\u03b1 as x \u2192 0+\n(K an arbitrary positive constant).\nFinally, we translate the phase space trajectories described above into solutions of (38) and discuss their physical significance. The trajectory in R \u00d7 P is\nsuch that, by (39) and (40), we have\n1\ndx\n= x1\u2212(\u03b2+\u03b1) (\u03b2\u03b1)\u2212 3\nd\u03be\n\nwhich implies, imposing x(0) = 0, that\ni 1\nh\n1\n3\u03bb\n\u2212 1 (\u03b1+\u03b2) \u03b1+\u03b2\n\u2261 C\u03bb \u03be 2\u03bb+1 .\n\u03be\nf (\u03be) = x(\u03be) = (\u03b1 + \u03b2) (\u03b2\u03b1) 3\n3\u03bb\n\nThe trajectories in \u03a01 are such that f (\u03be) \u223c C\u03bb \u03be 2\u03bb+1 as \u03be \u2192 \u221e and, given\nthat y \u2243 Kx\u2212\u03b1 as x \u2192 0+ , by (39) and (40) one has\ndx\n=K\nd\u03be\nso that f (\u03be) \u223c K\u03be as \u03be \u2192 0+ .\n3\u03bb\nThe trajectories in \u03a02 are such that f (\u03be) \u223c C\u03bb \u03be 2\u03bb+1 as \u03be \u2192 +\u221e and\nf (\u03be) \u223c K\u03be 2 as \u03be \u2192 \u2212\u221e. Since there is no front in this case, we do not consider\nthis solution to be physically relevant.\n3\u03bb\nThe trajectories in \u03a03 are such that f (\u03be) \u223c C\u03bb \u03be 2\u03bb+1 as \u03be \u2192 0+ and f (\u03be) \u223c\n2\nK\u03be as \u03be \u2192 \u221e.\n3\u03bb\nThe trajectories in \u03a04 are such that f (\u03be) \u223c C\u03bb \u03be 2\u03bb+1 as \u03be \u2192 0+ and f (\u03be) \u223c\nK(\u03be0 \u2212 \u03be) as \u03be \u2192 \u03be0\u2212 for some positive \u03be0 . They are compactly supported.\nIn addition there exist another four families of solutions such that the trajectories in phase space approach asymptotically to two of the manifolds \u03a0i\n16\n\n\f(i = 1, 2, 3, 4). The first one approaches \u03a01 and \u03a04 so that behaves linearly\nat the origin and linearly close to some \u03be0 > 0. It is compactly supported and\nlacks a clear physical significance. The second one approaches \u03a04 and \u03a02 so\nthat it is linear at the origin and grows quadratically at infinity. For them y < 0\nwhich implies that f \u2032 (\u03be) < 0. They represent dewetting solutions. The third\none approaches \u03a02 and \u03a03 and grows quadratically at \u00b1\u221e presenting no fronts.\nThe last one approaches \u03a03 and \u03a01 . It behaves linearly at the origin and grows\nquadratically at infinity.\nTo summarize, one has infinitely many solutions that behave linearly at the\n3\u03bb\norigin and such that f (\u03be) \u223c C\u03bb \u03be 2\u03bb+1 as \u03be \u2192 \u221e. There is only one solution\n3\u03bb\n(which is explicit) such that f (\u03be) \u223c C\u03bb \u03be 2\u03bb+1 at the origin (zero contact angle)\nand at infinity. There exist infinitely many solutions with zero contact angle at\nthe origin and growing quadratically at infinity and, finally there exist dewetting solutions which are linear at the origin and grow quadratically at infinity.\nHence, the only local behaviors near the interface for moving fronts are those\nwith finite contact angle and the one with zero contact angle.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank the IMA (University of Minnesota),\nthe Mathematics Department of the University of North Texas and the Departament of Applied Mathematics of Universidad Rey Juan Carlos for their support\nand use of their facilities.\n\nReferences\n[1] Ansini L. and Giacomelli L. \"Shear-thinning liquid films: Macroscopic and\nasymptotic behavior by quasi self-similar solutions\", Nonlinearity 15 (6),\npp. 2147-2164 (2002).\n[2] Barenblatt G.
