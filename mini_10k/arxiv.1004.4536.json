Introduction\nThe Wide Field X-Ray Telescope (WFXT)1 is\na medium-class mission designed to be about\ntwo orders of magnitude more sensitive than\nany previous or planned X-ray mission for\nlarge area surveys and to match in sensitivity\nthe next generation of wide-area optical, infrared, and radio surveys (see Giacconi et al.\n2009; Murray et al. 2009, for details)\nIn five years of operation, WFXT will carry\nout three extragalactic surveys:\n\u2013 a wide survey, which will cover most of the\nextragalactic sky (\u223c 20, 000 deg2) at \u223c 500\ntimes the sensitivity, and 20 times better\nangular resolution (\u223c 5\") of the ROSAT All\nSky Survey;\nSend offprint requests to: P. Padovani\n1\nhttp://www.eso.org/\u223cprosati/WFXT/Overview.html\n\n\u2013 a medium survey, which will map \u223c 3000\ndeg2 to deep Chandra or XMM - COSMOS\nsensitivities;\n\u2013 a deep survey, which will probe \u223c 100\ndeg2, or \u223c 1000 times the area of\nthe Chandra Deep Fields, to the deepest\nChandra sensitivity.\n\nI explore here the possible WFXT synergies with future radio surveys. Sect. 2 describes\nthe current status of radio surveys, while a selection of up-coming and future radio projects\nis described in Sect. 3. Sect. 4 deals with the\nsource population in deep radio and X-ray surveys, while the X-ray/radio synergy is discussed in Sect. 5. My conclusions are summarised in Sect. 6 As this is not a review of\nfuture radio projects, only basic information\non them will be provided. Readers wanting to\nknow more should consult the relevant references and World Wide Web pages.\n\n\f2\n\nPadovani: WFXT synergies with next generation radio surveys\n\n2. Current radio surveys\nCurrently available radio surveys can be divided, as it is the case for most observational bands, into two main categories: shallow/large area and deep/small area (see, e.g.,\nFig. 1 of Norris et al. 2009). The first group includes, above 0.5 GHz: the NRAO VLA Sky\nSurvey (NVSS; Condon et al. 1998), which\ncovers 82% of the sky (\u03b4 > \u221240\u25e6 ) at 1.4\nGHz down to 2.5 mJy, with a 45\" resolution;\nthe Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty\ncentimeters (FIRST; Becker et al. 1995), covering 22% of the sky (the North Galactic Cap)\nat 1.4 GHz down to 1 mJy, with a 5\" resolution; the Sydney University Molonglo Sky\nSurvey (SUMSS; Mauch et al. 2003), which\nmaps 63% of the sky (\u03b4 < \u221230\u25e6 and |bII | > 10\u25e6 )\nat 843 MHz down to \u223c 10 mJy, with a resolution similar to that of the NVSS. The second category includes a number of Very Large\nArray (VLA) small area surveys below 0.1 mJy\nat a few GHz, reaching a maximum area of\n\u223c 2 deg2 (VLA-COSMOS; Bondi et al. 2008)\nand a minimum flux density \u223c 15 \u03bcJy at 1.4\nGHz (SWIRE; Owen & Morrison 2008) and\n\u223c 7.5 \u03bcJy at 8.4 GHz (SA 13; Fomalont et al.\n2002).\n\n3. Up-coming and future radio\nsurveys\nRadio astronomy is at the verge of a revolution,\nwhich will produce large area surveys reaching\nflux density limits way below current ones. I\nhighlight here some of projects, which are being planned.\n\n3.1. LOw Frequency ARray\nThe LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR)2 is a\nnew radio telescope designed and built by\nASTRON (the Netherlands Institute for Radio\nAstronomy) in collaboration with Dutch universities and other European partners. LOFAR\noperates in a largely unexplored region of the\nelectro-magnetic spectrum (from below 20 up\n\nto \u223c 240 MHz), and consists of a distributed\ninterferometric array of dipole antenna stations\nthat permit large areas of the sky to be imaged\nsimultaneously.\nLOFAR will carry out large area surveys at\n15, 30, 60, 120 and 200 MHz reaching different\nflux density limits (see Morganti et al. 2009,\nfor details). For the largest area planned the\n120 MHz survey will reach \u2248 0.5 mJy, which\nis equivalent to \u2248 0.1 mJy at 1.4 GHz for a\npower-law \u03b1r = 0.7 (S \u221d \u03bd\u2212\u03b1 ). The resolution\nis obviously dependent on the longest baseline\nand on the observing frequency, and will at best\nbe \u223c 3\" at 240 MHz. LOFAR has started operations in 2010.\nLOFAR will open up a whole new region of parameter space at low radio frequencies. Based on our knowledge of the spectra of the various classes of radio sources\nand LOFAR's sensitivity, the large majority of\ndetections should be radio- and star-forming\ngalaxies, in contrast with X-ray surveys, which\ninclude mostly radio-quiet AGN (see Sect. 4).\nHowever, the deeper surveys will reach fainter\nradio sources and should have a larger overlap\nwith the type of objects detected in the X-ray\nband by WFXT.\n\n3.2. Expanded VLA\nThe Expanded VLA (EVLA)3 Project will\nmodernise and extend the existing VLA. When\ncompleted in 2012, the EVLA will provide\nthe following capabilities: observing frequency\nbetween 1 and 50 GHz, reaching as low as 1\n\u03bcJy r.m.s. in 6 hours (i.e., between 5 and 20\ntimes better than the VLA), and resolution as\ngood as \u223c 1\" at 1.5 GHz and 0.03\" at 45 GHz.\nTo the best of my knowledge no large area surveys are being planned at present but some surveys will be obviously carried out by individual teams.\n\n3.3. Evolutionary Map of the Universe\nThe Australian Square Kilometre Array [SKA]\nPathfinder (ASKAP) will produce wide-deep\nradio surveys of the sky at 1.4 GHz. The high-\n\n2\n\nhttp://www.astron.nl/radio-observatory/astronomers/lofar-astronomers\n\n3\n\nhttp://science.nrao.edu/evla\n\n\fPadovani: WFXT synergies with next generation radio surveys\n\nest ranked ASKAP continuum project is the\nEvolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU)4 .\nThe primary goal of EMU is to make a\ndeep survey of the entire southern sky, extending as far north as \u03b4 = +30\u25e6 . By reaching a flux\ndensity limit \u2248 50 \u03bcJy EMU will have \u223c 50\ntimes more sensitivity than NVSS, whilst covering a similar area (75% of the sky) with a\nfive times better angular resolution (10\"). EMU\nwill then provide a similar gain with respect to\nprevious surveys as WFXT in the X-ray band\n(see, e.g., Fig. 1 of Norris et al. 2009).\nWith a likely start of operations in 2013,\nthe EMU catalogue, which will include around\n70 million sources, should be available to the\nastronomical community by around 2015.\nBesides ASKAP, other radio telescopes\ncurrently under construction in the lead-up to\nthe SKA include the Allen Telescope Array5\n(ATA), Apertif6 , and Meerkat7 .\n\n3.4. Square Kilometre Array\nThe Square Kilometre Array (SKA)8 will represent a true revolution in radio astronomy by\ncombining unprecedented versatility and sensitivity. It will provide an observing window\nbetween 70 MHz and 10 GHz reaching flux\ndensity limits well into the nanoJy regime.\nResolution will likely need to be < 1\" around\nGHz frequencies to avoid confusion, with a\nbaseline extending to at least 3,000 km. The\nfield of view will be large, up to \u223c 200 deg2 below 0.3 GHz and possibly reaching \u223c 25 deg2\nat 1.4 GHz. Timeline for completion is 2020,\nwith first science with 10% SKA around 2015\n- 2016. Location will be in the southern hemisphere, either Australia or South Africa.\nMany surveys are being planned with the\nSKA, possibly including an \"all-sky\" 1 \u03bcJy\nsurvey at 1.4 GHz and an HI survey out to\nredshift \u223c 1.5, which should consist of \u223c 109\ngalaxies.\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\nhttp://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/rnorris/emu\nhttp://ral.berkeley.edu/ata\nhttp://www.astron.nl/general/apertif/apertif\nhttp://www.ska.ac.za/meerkat\nhttp://www.skatelescope.org\n\n3\n\n4. The deep radio and X-ray skies\nBefore discussing the X-ray/radio synergy it\nis important to have a look first at the types\nof sources that are being detected in the two\nbands, as current deep radio and X-ray surveys\nare sampling somewhat different populations.\nFor example, the X-ray selected sample of\nPolletta et al. (2007), with an X-ray flux limit\nf (2 \u221210 keV) > 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 contains \u223c\n97% Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), \u2248 10% of\nthem radio-loud (as derived from the radio data\nprovided in their paper). Similarly, the 1 Ms\nobservations of the Chandra Deep Field South\n(CDFS) have shown that, amongst the optically\nbrightest sources, 75% are AGN and only 22%\nare associated with galaxies [Szokoly et al.\n(2004); see also, e.g., Feruglio et al. (2008)\nand references therein]. On the other hand,\ndeep (S 1.4 GHz \u2265 42 \u03bcJy) radio observations of\nthe VLA-CDFS have identified >\n\u223c 40% AGN\n(about half of them radio-loud) and <\n\u223c 60%\nstar-forming galaxies (SFG) (Padovani et al.\n2009). Therefore, while faint X-ray sources are\nmostly radio-quiet AGN, deep radio surveys\nare revealing SFG and AGN in almost equal\nnumbers, with only about half of the latter, or\n\u2248 1/5 of the total, being radio-quiet.\nThis small population overlap is corroborated by the fractions of sources detected in\none band with counterparts in the other one.\nOf the radio sources in the VLA-Extended\nCDFS (ECDFS) sample of Miller et al. (2008)\n(S 1.4 GHz \u2265 32 \u03bcJy) only \u223c 34% are found in\nthe 2 Ms X-ray catalogue of Luo et al. (2008).\nAnd only \u223c 20% of the X-ray sources in 2 Ms\ncatalogue have a radio counterpart in the VLAECDFS survey (Vattakunnel & Tozzi, private\ncommunication).\nIt is important to note that X-ray data, including upper limits, play a very important role\nin the identification of faint (sub-mJy) radio\nsources, as shown by Padovani et al. (2009).\nIn fact, the radio-to-optical flux density ratio\nis not a very good discriminant between SFG\nand AGN. Radio power fares somewhat better\nbut is not helpful in separating SFG from radioquiet AGN. On the other hand, high X-ray\npowers (Lx > 1042 erg/s) can only be reached\nby AGN.\n\n\f4\n\nPadovani: WFXT synergies with next generation radio surveys\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\nFig. 1. The 0.5 \u2013 2 keV X-ray flux vs. 1.4 GHz radio flux density for the AGN (filled squares) and starforming galaxies (SFG; empty circles) in the VLA-CDFS sample (Padovani et al. 2009). Upper limits are\nalso indicated (AGN: thick lines; SFG: thin lines). The loci of SFG (slanted dashed line; Ranalli et al. 2003),\nX-ray selected (mostly radio-quiet) (leftmost dotted line, from data in Polletta et al. 2007, converted to the\n0.5 \u2013 2 keV band) and radio-quiet, radio-selected AGN (rightmost dotted line from data in Padovani et al.\n2009) are also shown. The position of these loci with respect to the survey limits determines the fraction\nof sources of a given class detected in one band with counterparts in the other. The horizontal solid lines\nindicate the limits of the WFXT Wide, Medium, and Deep surveys, while the two rightmost vertical dashed\nlines denote the limits of the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) and SKA 1 \u03bcJy surveys, both of\nwhich will cover a large fraction of the sky. The latter represents also the approximate EVLA r.m.s. level.\nThe leftmost vertical dashed line at 0.1 \u03bcJy represents the upper limit for other smaller area SKA surveys,\nwhich will likely be conducted.\n\n5. The X-ray/radio synergy\nFigure 1 plots 0.5 \u2013 2 keV X-ray flux vs. 1.4\nGHz radio flux density and includes the limits\n\n\fPadovani: WFXT synergies with next generation radio surveys\n\nof the WFXT, EMU, and SKA 1 \u03bcJy surveys\n(I am considering here only high-frequency radio surveys for the reasons discussed in Sect.\n3.1.). Note that, confusion aside, SKA should\nbe able to detect sources as faint as a few tens\nof nanoJy.\nThe loci of SFG, X-ray selected, and radioquiet, radio-selected AGN are also shown.\nThese give only order of magnitude estimates\nas the dispersion around the mean value can\nbe quite large. For instance, AGN will span\nthe full range between the two dotted lines\nin Fig. 1, with X-ray (radio) selection favouring sources with high (low) X-ray-to-radio flux\ndensity ratios. The position of these loci with\nrespect to the survey limits determines the fraction of sources of a given class detected in one\nband with counterparts in the other. For example, very few AGN in the WFXT Wide survey\nwill have a radio counterpart in the EMU survey because the locus of X-ray selected AGN\n(leftmost dotted line in Fig. 1) is to the left of\n\u221213\nthe EMU limit for f (0.5 \u2212 2 keV) <\n\u223c 10 erg\n\u22122 \u22121\ncm s .\nFor illustration purposes the fluxes of the\nAGN and SFG VLA-CDFS sources are also\nshown (Padovani et al. 2009). The AGN below\nthe radio-quiet AGN locus are identified with\nradio-galaxies.\n\n5.1. The X-ray survey perspective\nFigure 1 shows that the bulk of the X-ray\nsources in the WFXT Wide survey will have a\nradio counterpart in a possible SKA 1 \u03bcJy survey. This should help in the identification work\nof the 10 million or so expected objects by also\nproviding very accurate positions. Similarly,\nmost objects belonging to the Medium survey\nwill be detected in SKA surveys at, or below,\nthe \u2248 0.3 \u03bcJy level.\nFinally, most SFG in the Deep survey will\nhave a radio counterpart already at the EMU\nlevels, while they will all be detected in an\nSKA 1 \u03bcJy survey. Radio detection of the bulk\nof the AGN will need much fainter (< 0.1 \u03bcJy)\nradio flux limits. This might be accomplished\nby the SKA given also the small area of the\nWFXT Deep survey (\u223c 100 deg2 ). All of this,\nand what follows below (Sect. 5.2), obviously\n\n5\n\nrequires that WFXT surveys are carried out in\nthe southern sky.\n\n5.2. The radio survey perspective\nFigure 1 shows that the bulk of the radioquiet AGN in the EMU survey will have an Xray counterpart in the WFXT Medium Survey,\nwhich should greatly facilitate their optical\nidentification. Overall, one expects < 34% Xray detections, based on the CDFS, which goes\ndeeper in the X-rays. However, most EMU\nsources, including SFG, should be detected\nby the WFXT Deep survey. The EMU/WFXT\ncombination will provide in this case a better\nsample than the VLA-CDFS one on an area\n\u223c 500 times larger, for a total of > 100, 000\nsources.\nThe bulk of radio-quiet AGN in an SKA\n1 \u03bcJy survey will have an X-ray counterpart\nin the WFXT Deep survey. However, at these\nflux density levels most objects are expected to\nbe of the SFG type (see, e.g., Padovani et al.\n2009), which means that the majority of these\nradio sources will not be detected in the X-rays\neven at the deepest WFXT limit.\nFinally, a fraction of the radio-quiet AGN\nin SKA surveys reaching below 0.1 \u03bcJy should\nhave an X-ray counterpart in the WFXT Deep\nsurvey. Since at these levels the expected optical magnitudes are very faint even for unabsorbed sources (>\n\u223c 26), X-ray information is\ngoing to be vital for source identification.\n\n6. Conclusions\nRadio astronomy is at the verge of revolutionary advances, which over the next ten years\nor so will allow the detection of radio sources\nas much as >\n\u223c 100 times fainter than currently\navailable.\nAlthough at present X-ray and radio surveys detect somewhat different sources, with\nAGN making up most of the deep X-ray sky\nwhile sharing this role with star-forming galaxies in the radio band, synergy between the two\nbands is already required since, for example,\nX-ray information is vital to establish the nature of faint radio sources.\n\n\f6\n\nPadovani: WFXT synergies with next generation radio surveys\n\nThe availability of deep radio catalogues\nwith very accurate source positions will be a\nhuge asset to WFXT. Similarly, WFXT data\nwill provide vital help with the identification\nof faint radio sources down to \u2248 50 \u03bcJy. At\nlower flux densities the X-ray counterparts of\nmost radio sources are expected to be fainter\nthan the WFXT deepest limit.\nIn summary, the combination of future\ndeep radio surveys with WFXT will shed light\non the nature of very faint X-ray and radio\nsources.\nAcknowledgements.
