Since then, semiclassical methods\nhave continued to attract great interest for two primary reasons. First, semiclassical methods\ngive insight into classical-quantum correspondence. Second, for large systems they hold\nthe promise of significant computational advantages relative to full quantum mechanical\ncalculations. In particular, in recent years much progress has been made in the chemical\nphysics community in developing time-dependent semiclassical methods that are accurate\nand efficient for multidimensional systems. By semiclassical methods, one generally means\nthe calculation of a quantum mechanical wavefunction or propagator via the propagation\nof classical (or classical-like) trajectories. Mathematically speaking, semiclassical methods\ncast the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation (TDSE), which is a PDE, in terms of ODEs\nrelated to classical equations of motion. From a physical point of view, the semiclassical\nmethods try to circumvent the non-locality of quantum mechanics.\nIn this paper we present a new method that is to some extent a cross between a numerical\ngrid method and a semiclassical method. The method is derived by inserting a trial form eiS/~\ninto the TDSE and calculating the time-dependent complex phase at a stationary position.\nSince the method yields an approximate solution of the TDSE at a fixed position it is a cousin\nof grid methods. However, we compute S by solving a hierarchy of spatial derivatives of S\nalong a stationary trajectory; information from the neighboring trajectories is incorporated\nonly through the initial conditions. This property makes the approximation local from the\nquantum mechanical point of view, and hence a cousin of semiclassical methods. We refer\nto the new method as the zero-velocity complex action method (ZEVCA) since it employs\na complex phase (action) and stationary trajectories.\nThe substitution of eiS/~ as an ansatz in the TDSE is the same starting point as several methods that are based on the hydrodynamic and Bohmian formulations of quantum mechanics[2, 3, 4, 5]. More specifically, ZEVCA is related to the Derivative Propagation Method[6], the Trajectory Stability Method[7] and Bohmian Mechanics with Complex\nAction[8]. As in the case with ZEVCA, these methods incorporate equations of motion for\na hierarchy of spatial derivatives of the phase (and amplitude) that are calculated along\ntrajectories. But unlike ZEVCA, in these other approaches the time dependent trajectories\n2\n\n\fpropagate in either real or complex configuration space. The ZEVCA formulation employs\nfixed trajectories that yield the time dependence of the wavefunction at a fixed, predetermined position in configuration space. In reference [5] section 7.2, Wyatt considers the\nsolution of the global hydrodynamic equations of quantum mechanics on fixed grid points\n(Eulerian grid) but he dismisses its usefulness as a numerical tool. The ZEVCA formulation\nshows how to obtain useful output of a local propagation at a single grid point.\nFor a number of quantum mechanical calculations, such as thermal rates or tunneling\nprobabilities, knowledge of the wavefunction in all of configuration space is unnecessary:\nthese quantities can be calculated by data at a single position or a small interval of space.\nFor such calculations, ZEVCA has a significant numerical advantage since it produces local\ninformation at a predetermined position. The first application of ZEVCA that we present in\nthis paper is the calculation of tunneling probabilities; ZEVCA is well suited for this calculation since tunneling probabilities can be calculated from a time integral of the probability\ncurrent at a fixed position. The second application is the calculation of the lowest energy\neigenvalue of a bound potential. For this application we make a minor modification to the\nZEVCA formulation to adapt it to imaginary time propagation. In both applications we\ncalculate the results by propagating just a single trajectory.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In section II we formulate ZEVCA for the real time\nSchr\u00f6dinger propagator (section II A) and the imaginary time Schr\u00f6dinger propagator (section II B). Since the multi-dimensional representation of ZEVCA is somewhat more complicated, we present only the one-dimensional derivation. Section III is dedicated to the\nimplementation of ZEVCA for the derivation of tunneling probabilities (III A) and the first\nenergy eigenvalue of a bound potential (III B). In section IV we present our summary and\nconcluding remarks.\n\nII.\n\nFORMULATION\nA.\n\nThe ZEVCA real time Schr\u00f6dinger propagator\n\nWe start by inserting the ansatz[9, 10, 11]\n\u0015\ni\n\u03c8(x, t) = exp S(x, t) ,\n~\n\u0014\n\n3\n\n(2.1)\n\n\finto the TDSE\n\n~2\n\u03c8xx + V (x, t)\u03c8,\n(2.2)\n2m\nwhere S(x, t) is a complex function, ~ is Planck's constant divided by 2\u03c0, m is the mass\ni~\u03c8t = \u2212\n\nof the particle and V (x, t) is the potential energy function. The subscripts denote partial\nderivatives. The result is a quantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation[9, 10, 11]\nSt +\n\ni~\n1 2\nSx + V =\nSxx ,\n2m\n2m\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere we recognize the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation on the LHS. On the RHS is an\nadditional non-classical term that can be referred to as a \"quantum potential\". Our aim\nis to solve eq.(2.3) using the method of characteristics. This method is usually applied\nto the solution of first order PDEs. The underlying idea of the method of characteristics\nis to transform a single PDE (or a set of PDEs) to a set of ODEs that are solved along\na characteristic curve. The characteristic is defined by setting a dependence between the\nindependent variables of the PDE (or PDEs), in our case x and t. ZEVCA makes the\nsimplest possible choice for the characteristics:\ndx\n= 0 =\u21d2 x(t) = x(0),\ndt\n\n(2.4)\n\ni.e. the characteristics are trajectories that remain at a constant position. The time dependence of the phase along the trajectory is given by inserting S(x, t) in the Lagrangian time\nderivative defined as\n\u2202\ndx \u2202\nd\n\u2261\n+\n.\n(2.5)\ndt\n\u2202t\ndt \u2202x\nThe choice we made in eq.(2.4) equates the Lagrangian time derivative and the partial time\nderivative\n\nd\ndt\n\n=\n\n\u2202\n.\n\u2202t\n\nThe result of the substitution is\ndS\ni~\n1 2\n= St =\nSxx \u2212\nS \u2212 V,\ndt\n2m\n2m x\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhere we have used eq.(2.3). The integration of eq.(2.6) requires Sx [x(0), t] and Sxx [x(0), t].\nNote that the initial position x(0) acts as a parameter. Defining\nSn [x(0), t] \u2261\n\n\u2202nS\n\u2202xn\n\n,\n\n(2.7)\n\n[x(0),t]\n\nwe can write a general equation of motion for Sn [x(0), t] \u2200n in the following manner. We\n\ntake the nth spatial partial derivative of eq.(2.3)\n(St )n +\n\n1\ni~\n(S12 )n + Vn =\nSn+2 ,\n2m\n2m\n4\n\n(2.8)\n\n\fand insert the result in the time derivative of Sn\ndSn\ni~\n1\n= (St )n =\nSn+2 \u2212\n(S12 )n \u2212 Vn ,\ndt\n2m\n2m\n\n(2.9)\n\nwhere we have assumed that the time and spatial derivatives are interchangeable. Equation (2.9) reveals that the equation of motion of Sn depends on the result of two subsequent equations (by the dependence on Sn+2 ) and on all prior equations by the term\n\u0001\nP\n(S12 )n = nj=0 nj Sj+1 Sn\u2212j+1. Hence, the general characteristic solution of eq.(2.3) yields an\ninfinite hierarchy of ODEs defined by eqs.(2.9) where n = 0, 1, ..., \u221e. In other words, we\n\nhave converted eq.(2.3) to an infinite set of local but coupled ODEs that generate the time\ndependence of the complex phase and its spatial derivatives at position x(0). An approximation can now be obtained by truncating the set at some n = N; this is done by setting\nSN +1 = SN +2 = 0. We summarize the equations of motion of the ZEVCA approximation\ni~\n1\ndSn\n=\nSn+2 \u2212\n(S 2 )n \u2212 Vn [x(0)]; n = 0, 1, ..., N,\ndt\n2m\n2m 1\nSN +1 = SN +2 = 0,\n\n(2.10)\n\nwhere we emphasize that the partial derivatives of the potential are taken at a fixed position\nx(0). The initial conditions of eqs.(2.10) are given by\nSn [x(0), 0] = \u2212i~\n\n\u2202 n ln[\u03c8(x, 0)]\n\u2202xn\n\n.\n\n(2.11)\n\nx(0)\n\nwhere we used the relation S(x, 0) = \u2212i~ ln[\u03c8(x, 0)] from ansatz (2.1). After we solve set\n(2.10), the wavefunction at x(0) is given by\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\ni\n\u03c8[x(0), t] = exp S0 [x(0), t] .\n~\nB.\n\n(2.12)\n\nThe ZEVCA imaginary time Schr\u00f6dinger propagator\n\nh\ni\n\u0124\u03c4\nThe imaginary time Schr\u00f6dinger propagator takes the form exp \u2212 2 where\n\u0124 = \u2212\n\n~2 \u2202 2\n+ V (x\u0302).\n2m \u2202x2\n\n(2.13)\n\nApplying this operator to an initial function \u03c8(x, 0) yields a \"wavefunction\" \u03c8\u0303(x, \u03c4 ) that is\na solution of a Schr\u00f6dinger-like equation\n\u2212 2\u03c8\u0303\u03c4 (x, \u03c4 ) = \u2212\n\n~2\n\u03c8\u0303xx (x, \u03c4 ) + V (x)\u03c8\u0303(x, \u03c4 ),\n2m\n5\n\n(2.14)\n\n\f\u03c4 (hence\nwhere \u03c4 plays the role of time. The mapping of \u03c4 to pure imaginary time t\u0303 = \u2212 i~\n2\nthe term-\"imaginary time propagation\") transforms the last equation to the form of the\nTDSE\ni~\u03c8\u0303t\u0303 (x, t\u0303) = \u2212\n\n~2\n\u03c8\u0303xx (x, t\u0303) + V (x)\u03c8\u0303(x, t\u0303),\n2m\n\n(2.15)\n\nwhere for simplicity we allow a slight misuse of notation \u03c8\u0303(x, \u03c4 ) \u2192 \u03c8\u0303(x, t\u0303). At this stage we\ninsert in eq.(2.15) an ansatz identical to eq.(2.1)\n\u0014\n\u0015\ni\n\u03c8\u0303(x, t\u0303) = exp S\u0303(x, t\u0303) ,\n~\nand apply the ZEVCA formulation (section II A).\n\n(2.16)\n\nThis yields equations identical to\n\neqs.(2.10) and (2.11) with the only difference being t \u2192 t\u0303.\nIII.\nA.\n\nMODEL APPLICATIONS\nTunneling probabilities\n\nIn this section we calculate tunneling probabilities form an Eckart barrier using a single\ntrajectory propagation. The potential is given by\nV (x) =\n\nD\n,\n[cosh(\u03b2x)]2\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere D is the barrier height and 1/\u03b2 gives an estimate of the barrier width. The initial\nwavefunction is a Gaussian wavepacket\n\u0014\n\u0015\ni\ni\n2\n\u03c8(x, 0) = exp \u2212\u03b10 (x \u2212 xc ) + pc (x \u2212 xc ) + \u03b30 ,\n~\n~\n\n(3.2)\n\n\u221a\nln( 2\u03b1\u03c0 0 ) takes care of the normalizawhere 1/ \u03b10 relates to the Gaussian width and \u03b30 = \u2212 i~\n4\ntion. xc and pc are the average position and momentum respectively.

These restrictions ensure that\nthe initial conditions \"capture\" the wavefunction and the potential's surroundings at x(0).\nThese restrictions have prevented us from choosing an xc in the negative asymptotic region\nof the Eckart barrier since such a choice would have produced \u03c8(0, 0) \u2192 0.\n\n10\n\n\fB.\n\nEnergy eigenvalues\n\nThe ZEVCA imaginary time propagator allows for a simple calculation of the first energy\neigenvalue of a bound potential. As in the pervious application, the calculation requires just\na single trajectory propagation. We start with a short derivation that demonstrates how the\nfirst eigenvalue may be calculated using imaginary time propagation. An arbitrary bound\npotential defines a set of eigenfunctions \u03c6j (x), j = 1, 2..., \u221e that satisfy \u0124\u03c6j (x) = Ej \u03c6j ,\nwhere Ej are the energy eigenvalues and \u0124 is given in eq.(2.13). The eigenfunctions can be\nused as a basis set for the expansion of an arbitrary wavefunction \u03c8(x)\n\u03c8(x) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\naj \u03c6j (x),\n\n(3.11)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere\n\nP\u221e\n\nj=0 |aj |\n\n2\n\n= 1. If we define a time scale \u03c41 =\n\n2\u03c0~\nE1\n\nthen the operation of the imaginary\n\ntime propagator for \u03c4 \u226b \u03c41 on an initial wavepacket \u03c8(x, 0) yields\n#\n\"\n# \u221e\n\"\n\u0124\u03c4 X\n\u0124\u03c4\n\u03c8(x, 0) = lim exp \u2212\naj \u03c6j (x)\nlim exp \u2212\n\u03c4 \u226b\u03c41\n\u03c4 \u226b\u03c41\n~\n~ j=1\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u221e\nX\nEj \u03c4\naj \u03c6j (x) exp \u2212\n= lim\n\u03c4 \u226b\u03c41\n~\nj=1\n\u0014\n\u0015\nE1 \u03c4\n= a1 \u03c61 (x) exp \u2212\n.\n~\n\n(3.12)\n\nIn the first stage we inserted eq.(3.11), in the second stage we applied the imaginary time\npropagator on the eigenfunctions and in the last stage we applied the limit. Inserting the\nrelation \u03c4 =\n\n2i\nt\u0303\n~\n\nin the final result of eq.(3.12) and equating it with eq.(2.16) yields\n\u0015\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0014\ni\n2iE1 t\u0303\n= exp S\u0303(x, t\u0303) ,\na1 \u03c61 (x) exp \u2212 2\n~\n~\n\n(3.13)\n\nhence,\n2E1 t\u0303\n\u2212 i~ ln[a1 \u03c61 (x)].\n~\nTaking the t\u0303 partial derivative of the last equation yields\nS\u0303(x, t\u0303) = \u2212\n\n~\nE1 = \u2212 S\u0303t\u0303 (x, t\u0303),\n2\n\n(3.14)\n\n(3.15)\n\nwhere we recall that this relation holds for \u03c4 \u226b \u03c41 =\u21d2 |t\u0303| \u226b ~\u03c41 . As we mentioned in section\nII B, eqs.(2.10) hold for the imaginary time propagator with the substitution of t \u2192 t\u0303.

TSM [7] emerges from conventional Bohmian\nmechanics by constructing a hierarchy of equations of motion for spatial derivatives of the\nphase and the amplitude of the wavefunction. In reference [12], Liu and Makri use TSM\nfor imaginary time propagation at constant-position characteristics, as we do here. But the\nmodification of TSM for imaginary time propagation is non-unique; moreover, producing\nconstant-position characteristics is quite an elaborate procedure that must be repeated at\nevery time step. In contrast, the ZEVCA transformation from the Schr\u00f6dinger real time\npropagator to the imaginary time propagator is unique and the fixed characteristics are\nobtained for all time simply by choosing\n\ndx\ndt\n\n= 0. As we demonstrate, the energy eigenvalues\n\nobtained using ZEVCA are of the same accuracy as using TSM while the formulation is\ndecidedly simpler.\nFor the sake of comparison, we consider two of the potentials that were studied in reference\n[12]. The first is a quartic potential V (x) = 21 x2 + x4 . The parameters of the Gaussian initial\nwavepacket (eq.(3.2)) are \u03b10 = 0.5, xc = 1 and p0 = 0 with m = 1. The fixed trajectory\nthat we propagate is at x(0) = 0. The results are very robust with respect to the choice of\nthe initial parameters. In fig.4 we depict E1 (eq.(3.16)) as function of \u03c4 (\u03c4 =\n\n2i\nt\u0303)\n~\n\nfor a series\n\nof values of the truncation order N. The relative error between the exact energy eigenvalue\n(E1 = 0.8038) and the ZEVCA approximations are roughly 38%, 4% and 0.6% for N = 2,\nN = 4 and N = 8 respectively. For N = 16 the relative error reaches 0.1%. We see a clear\nconvergence to the exact quantum mechanical result as a function of N.\nThe second example is a Morse potential V (x) = D[1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03b1x)]2 . The parameters of\nthe potential and the mass are D = 0.1745, \u03b1 = 1.026 and m = 1837/2. These parameters\ncorrespond to the vibration of an H2 molecule. The parameters of the initial Gaussian\nwavepacket (eq.(3.2)) are \u03b10 = 4.5924, xc = 0.1 and p0 = 0. The fixed trajectory is\npositioned at x(0) = 0. As in the previous example, the results are robust with respect\nto the choice of the initial Gaussian parameters and the position of the fixed trajectory,\nx(0). In fig.5 we depict E1 as function of \u03c4 for a series of values of the truncation order N.\nThe relative error between the exact energy eigenvalue (E1 = 0.0098565) and the ZEVCA\napproximations are roughly 1.4%, 0.08% and 2 * 10\u22124 % for N = 2, N = 4 and N = 6\n12\n\n\fQuartic potential\n0.8\n\nE\n\n1\n\n0.6\n0.4\nExact E1\nN=2\nN=4\nN=8\n\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\u03c4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nFIG. 4: A comparison between the exact lowest energy eigenvalue of a quartic potential and\nthe results obtained using a the ZEVCA imaginary time propagator in eq.(3.16) with series of\nvalues of the truncation parameter N .

In this example we see a faster convergence to the exact result as a function\nof N than in the quartic case. The reason is that the parameters of the Morse potential\ncorrespond to a small perturbation from a harmonic oscillator potential. For the harmonic\noscillator it is possible to show that the ZEVCA approximation for N = 2 yields the exact\nquantum result. For anharmonic oscillators, the truncation at N = 2 incorporates only\nVj [x(0), 0], j = 0, 1, 2 in eqs.(2.10), which is equivalent to making a harmonic approximation\nto the potential (note that the results obtained for N = 2 for both the quartic potential and\nthe Morse potential correspond to the energy eigenvalue of the harmonic approximation to\nthe two potentials respectively). Since the parameters of the Morse potential correspond\nto a smaller perturbation from a harmonic oscillator potential than the parameters for the\nquartic potential, the convergence with N is faster.\n\n13\n\n\fMorse potential\n\n\u22123\n\nx 10\n10\n\nE\n\n1\n\n9.9\n9.8\n9.7\n\nExact E1\n\n9.6\n\nN=2\nN=4\nN=6\n\n9.5\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n\u03c4\n\n600\n\n800\n\nFIG. 5: A comparison between the exact lowest energy eigenvalue of a Morse potential and the\nresults obtained by using the ZEVCA imaginary time propagator in eq.(3.16) with series of values\nof the truncation parameter N .

The formulation was applied\nto the calculation of tunneling probabilities and low energy eigenvalues, with surprisingly\ngood accuracy. The ZEVCA formulation has several advantages: (1) The derivation of the\nformulation is straightforward and the equations of motion are readily solvable by standard\nnumerical software. (2) The ZEVCA approximation yields the solution of the TDSE at a\nfixed and predetermined position. This allows for easy application to quantum quantities\nthat require only local information. (3) The ZEVCA formulation requires the calculation\nof the potential and its derivatives only at x(0) (see eqs.(2.10)). This is in contrast to\nmost semiclassical methods that propagate trajectories in configuration space and require\nthe calculation of the potential (or its derivatives) at each time step. (4) No root search\n14\n\n\fis needed as in many other semiclassical methods. (5) The extension to imaginary time\npropagation is easily attainable. (6) By taking N \u2192 \u221e, ZEVCA formally gives the exact\nquantum result. Although we have not conducted a rigorous comparison of timings, for the\napplications presented here ZEVCA was found to be several orders of magnitude faster than\nthe exact quantum calculation using a Split Operator method.\nStill, the numerical implementations reveals a number of limitations. First, the convergence to the exact result as a function of N seems to be asymptotic, in the sense that there\nis an optimal choice of N. Second, the method has difficulty at nodal positions. Surprisingly, this is not a result of the original ansatz (eq.(2.1)) but is a limitation imposed by the\ncondition of fixed trajectories. Since the trajectories are fixed, clearly they cannot cross. We\nhave demonstrated elsewhere that making the ansatz (2.1) but allowing for contributions\nfrom crossing trajectories can produce interference effects such as nodes and oscillations[13].\nThird, in section III A we have presented limitations on the relation between the position of\nthe initial wavefunction, the derivatives of the potential and the choice of x(0). These limitations originate from the need to incorporate in the initial conditions of ZEVCA \"sufficient\"\ndata for a successful propagation.\nAn alternative to the procedure we have described is to discard ansatz (2.1) and construct\na hierarchy of ODEs for the wavefunction \u03c8n [x(0), t] itself, instead of for the complex phase,\nSn [x(0), t]. We have explored this direction but found that it produces very poor results.\nIn the case of an initial Gaussian wavepacket it is readily verified that the truncation for\nN \u2265 2 does not entail any approximation to the complex phase derivatives Sn [x(0), 0] (see\neqs.(3.3)). This is not the case for the derivatives of the initial wavefunction \u03c8n [x(0), 0]\nitself, which go to infinity as a function of N for every choice of x(0). This observation\nprovides additional justification for making the replacement \u03c8 \u2192 eiS/~ in the first place.\nWe are currently working on several extensions of the ZEVCA formulation. Specifically,\nwe are exploiting the local properties of ZEVCA for the calculation of thermal rates[14].\nSimilar to the implementations of ZEVCA we have presented in this paper, the calculation\nof thermal rates requires only local information. This allows us to obtain thermal rates\nfor one-dimensional systems using only two trajectory propagations. We aim at exploring\nboth ZEVCA and its close relative, Bohmian Mechanics with Complex Action, in multidimensional quantum systems.\n\n15\n\n\fThis work was supported by the Israel Science Foundation (576/04).\n\n[1] G.
