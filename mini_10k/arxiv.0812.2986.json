The PSA solutions for the np \u2192 np elastic scattering are transformed to the np \u2192 pn\ncharge exchange representation using unitary transition, and good agreement is obtain.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Delta-Sigma experiment research program [1] intends to obtain a complete np data set at the zero\nangle: the measurements of total cross section differences \u2206\u03c3L (np) and \u2206\u03c3T (np) for the longitudinal (L)\nor transverse (T) beam and target polarizations and spin-correlation parameters A00kk (np) and A00nn (np)\n[2] as well as unpolarized measurements of values \u03c30 tot (np), d\u03c3/dt(np \u2192 pn) and Rdp . The main task of\nthese studies is to determine the Re and Im parts of np amplitudes over the energy region 1.2\u20133.7 GeV.\nThe energy dependence of \u2206\u03c3L (np) [2] shows an anomalous decrease to zero above 1.2 GeV and the\nstructure in \u2212\u2206\u03c3L (I = 0) around 1.8 GeV [3] predicted in [4, 5]. For the exhaustive analysis of this\nstructure it is necessary to build the Argand diagrams for the Re and Im parts of each of the three N N\nforward scattering amplitudes.\nTo reduce the sign ambiguities the Delta-Sigma collaboration measured\n\u000e\nthe ratio Rdp = d\u03c3/dt(nd) d\u03c3/dt(np) for the charge exchange quasi-elastic and elastic processes at 0 \u25e6\nusing the D2 and H2 targets. The knowledge of Rdp could provide additional constraint and will allow one\nof some sign uncertainties to be eliminated for the direct reconstruction of the Re parts of the scattering\namplitudes.\nThe Rdp value at zero angle defines the ratio rnfl/fl of the Non-Flip to Flip contributions in the np \u2192 pn\ncharge exchange process. This possibility is based on the deuteron properties that the deuteron is the\namplitude filter at small momentum transfer in the nd \u2192 p(nn) reaction, and the Non-Flip part vanishes\ndue to the Pauli principle for two slow neutrons. Therefore, the quasi-elastic nd differential cross section\nis the Flip yield of the np \u2192 pn charge exchange process. It is expressed by the Dean formula [6, 7, 8].\nThe np elastic reaction can be represented by two approaches: either as the charge exchange np \u2192 pn\nreaction to the \u03b8 angle (\u03b8 = \u03b8CM ) or as the neutron elastic scattering np \u2192 np in the inverted direction\nto the (\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8) angle. Though both representations have equivalent differential cross sections, their Flip\nor Non-Flip parts are absolutely different [9, 10]. The main cause for this distinction will be shown in\nsection 3. To compare the energy dependencies of experimental Rdp or estimated rnfl/fl with the PSA\nsolutions of np elastic scattering, we should use the true charge exchange amplitudes, which requires the\nunitary transition from the np \u2192 np (\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8) to the np \u2192 pn (\u03b8) elastic representation.\n\n2\n\nTheoretical approach for Rdp and r nfl/fl\n\nThe observable Rdp is the ratio of the quasi-elastic nd \u2192 p (nn) differential cross section to the free\nnp \u2192 pn charge exchange one (also named as CEX)\nRdp =\n\nd\u03c3/dt nd\u2192p (nn)\n.\nd\u03c3/dtCEX\n\n(1)\n\nFollowing the theory in [6, 7, 8], where the duration of nd collision is much smaller than the characteristic\nmotion period of deuteron nucleons, the nd \u2192 p (nn) quasi-elastic reaction can be expressed within the\n\n1\n\n\fframework of impulse approximation by the Dean formula\nd\u03c3 Non\u2212Flip\nd\u03c3 Flip\n1\nd\u03c3\n= (1 \u2212 F (t))\n+ (1 \u2212 F (t))\n.\ndt nd\u2192p (nn)\ndt CEX\n3\ndt CEX\n\n(2)\n\nHere F (t) is the deuteron form-factor which equals one for the forward direction, and when the scattering\nangle \u03b8 approaches zero, the first term on the right-hand of (2) vanishes\n2 d\u03c3 Flip\nd\u03c3\n=\n.\ndt nd\u2192p (nn) (0)\n3 dt CEX (0)\n\n(3)\n\nNote that this simplification is not possible if we take the elastic backward reaction np \u2192 np instead\nof the charge exchange forward one, because if the difference of masses Mn and Mp is neglecting, the\n2\nfour-momentum transfer t will be defined as \u22124PCM\nand the form-factor F (t) will not equal to one. The\nsimilar replacement could be justified if both np - elastic scattering representations (np \u2192 np backward\nor np \u2192 pn forward) are absolutely identical together with their Flip and Non-Flip parts. However, this\nhypothesis is not valid, as will be shown in the next section (see also [9, 10]). Moreover according to\nthe source [7] the formula (2) is defined using the representation of the charge exchange process as a\n\"generalization of the result found originally for K + d \u2192 K 0 pp by Lee [11]\". The author of this work\ntold also that: \"For the non-charge-exchange reaction, however, no such simple result follows\".\nnfl/fl\n\nFor Rdp (0) and rCEX (0) we have\n2\nRdp (0) =\n3\n\nd\u03c3 Flip\ndt CEX (0)\nd\u03c3\ndt CEX (0)\n\n=\n\n2\n1\n3 1 + rnfl/fl\n\nCEX (0)\n\n;\n\nnfl/fl\n\nrCEX (0) =\n\n2\n1\n\u22121.\n3 Rdp (0)\n\n(4)\n\nThus, the deuteron as an amplitude filter can be used in the measurement of Rdp for defining the Flip\nand Non-Flip parts of the np \u2192 pn process, i.e. for observing spin effects in the np interaction even\nwithout the beam and target polarizations.\n\n3\n\nTransition from the np \u2192 np (\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8) to the np \u2192 pn (\u03b8)\nreaction\n\nWithin the framework of isotopic invariance the nucleon-nucleon scattering matrix is\nM (k \u2032 , k) = M0 (k \u2032 , k)\n\n1 \u2212 \u03c4\u03021 \u03c4\u03022\n3 + \u03c4\u03021 \u03c4\u03022\n+ M1 (k \u2032 , k)\n.\n4\n4\n\n(5)\n\nHere \u03c4\u03021 and \u03c4\u03022 are the isotopic Pauli operators of nucleons, k and k \u2032 are the unit vectors of the initial\nand final relative momenta and the matrices M0 and M1 describe the N N scattering for the isotopic spin\nT = 0 and T = 1 respectively.

The amplitudes cCEX\nand cT\nT\nare equal, and for others we have\n\uf8eb\n\naCEX\n(\u03b8)\nT\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec bCEX (\u03b8)\n\uf8ec T\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec CEX\n\uf8ec eT\n(\u03b8)\n\uf8ed\nfTCEX (\u03b8)\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\naT (\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8)\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec b (\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8)\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec T\n\uf8f7 = A*\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec eT (\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8)\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\nfT (\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8)\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\u2212 21\n\n\u2212 21\n\n\u2212 12\n\n\u2212 21\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec \u22121\n\uf8ec 2\nA=\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 1\n\uf8ec \u22122\n\uf8ed\n\u2212 21\n\n\u2212 21\n\n+ 12\n\n+ 21\n\n+ 12\n\n+ 21\n\n\u2212 12\n\n\uf8f7\n+ 21 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n1 \uf8f7\n\u22122 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n+ 21\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\nwhere\n\n\uf8f6\n\n(12)\n\n1 The vector m in [14] defined as m\n\u2032\n\u2032\nw = (k \u2212 k)/|k \u2212 k |. Therefore the Wolfenstein (n, mw , l) basic is left-hand in\ncomparison with the Goldberger-Watson definition: mw = \u2212mg . However the signs of amplitudes will not change by the\nmeans of bilinear form of operator (\u03c3\u03021 m)(\u03c3\u03022 m). Hereinafter we shall use the right-hand (n, m, l) basis only.\n2 Now each of the charge exchange full amplitudes AmpCEX is the half-sum of the new defined pure isotopic amplitudes\nAmpCEX\nand AmpCEX\n: AmpCEX = 1/2 [AmpCEX\n+ AmpCEX\n].\n1\n0\n1\n0\n\n3\n\n\fThe inverse transition from the np \u2192 pn forward reaction to the np \u2192 np backward one will be equivalent\nbecause the matrix A is symmetric and unitary: A = A\u22121 \u21d2 |A| = 1. The unitary transition (12) and\ndefinition (8) give the equivalence of the differential cross sections of both np elastic representations even\nif their Non-Flip or Flip parts are different\nd\u03c3\nd\u03c3\nnp \u2192 np (\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8) =\nnp \u2192 pn (\u03b8) .\ndt\ndt\n\n(13)\n\nAccording to the properties of the N N amplitudes, when the scattering angle \u03b8 approaches zero, the\nadditional simplification arises b(\u03c0) = f (\u03c0), bCEX (0) = eCEX (0) and c(\u03c0) = cCEX (0) = 0. In this case\nour formulas will coincide with the expressions from [9, 10]\naCEX (0) = \u2212 21 (a(\u03c0) + 2b(\u03c0) + e(\u03c0))\nbCEX (0) = \u2212 21 (a(\u03c0) \u2212 e(\u03c0))\n\n.\n\n(14)\n\nf CEX (0) = \u2212 21 (a(\u03c0) \u2212 2b(\u03c0) + e(\u03c0))\nHere all amplitudes are half-sums of pure isotopic ones. We can see again the essential distinction of the\nNon-Flip amplitudes aCEX (0) and a(\u03c0). It is very interesting that the formalism of N N elastic scattering\nwas created more than 50 years ago but this issue was revealed only in 2005 year. The elegant method\nof papers [9, 10] uses the Hermitian operator of spin permutation P\u0302 = 12 (1 + \u03c3\u03021 \u03c3\u03022 ) and relates both\nscattering matrices\nM CEX (k \u2032 , k) = \u2212P\u0302 * M np\u2192np (\u2212k \u2032 , k) .\n(15)\nDividing the matrices into the spin-singlet SS and spin-triplet ST parts and using the simplest arithmetics\nP\u0302 \u015c = \u2212\u015c and P\u0302 T\u0302 = +T\u0302 , we can easily define\nM np\u2192np (\u2212k \u2032 , k) = SS + ST\n\nM CEX (k \u2032 , k) = SS \u2212 ST .\n\n(16)\n\nThe inversion of ST amplitudes3 is the main cause for the difference of these two np elastic representations\nand for the discrepancy between their spin structures.\n\n4\n\nExperimental results and comparison with PSA solution\n\nAccording to the research program, the Delta-Sigma collaboration has successfully fulfilled the measurements of the ratio Rdp (0) in four data-taking runs in 2002\u20132007. Using the liquid D2 /H2 targets as well\nas the solid CD2 /CH2 /C complimentary targets we obtained the 8 points at energies Tn = 0.5\u20132.0 GeV\n(see Tab. 2 and Fig. 1). Our preliminary results of Rdp (0) measurements were published in [3, 17, 18]. In\naddition, Delta-Sigma group have determined in 2007 a new data point at Tkin = 0.55 GeV to check the\nconsistency with other world experimental data at low energies. We presented all our points in [20, 19]\nand the full description of the data processing and the resulting 7 values at energies Tn = 0.5, 0.8, 1.0,\n1.2, 1.4, 1.8 and 2.0 GeV was given in [21] and will be published in [22]. The point at 1.7 GeV is also\nmeasured for the first time by the Delta-Sigma collaboration, but we have some doubts on its quality.\nIt is related with the estimation of number of nuclear in the H2 target, and the Rdp (0) value at 1.7 GeV\nhave a preliminary status for the present. All results of the ratio Rdp (0) are very close to 0.56 and their\nnfl/fl\nerrors are \u2248 5 %. Using (4) we calculated the values of the ratio rCEX (0) between the Non-Flip and Flip\nparts of the np \u2192 pn charge exchange process (see Table 2, Fig. 2). Our data are in a good agreement\nwith the LAMPF [23, 24] results (see 3 points below 1 GeV) and coincide exactly with the JINR [25]\npoint at 1.0 GeV. Other world values of Rdp (0) were taken from [26].\nnfl/fl\nFor comparison of our and other world data on Rdp (0) and rCEX (0) with the Phase Shift Analysis\n(PSA) we took from the SAID data base the solutions FA91 [27], VZ40 [28] and SP07 [29] for the\nnp \u2192 np (\u03c0) elastic reaction and transformed them to the np \u2192 pn (0) charge exchange representation\nusing the unitary transition (12). These energy dependencies were calculated using (4) and (8). As can\n3 The symmetry properties of the Wolfenstein amplitudes (Table 1) can be defined directly from (16): the amplitude B\n(\u2208 SS) is transformed without change of sign; G and N (\u2208 ST ) are inverted; the C and H (belonging also to the ST part)\nare inverted twice if we take into account that after the turn k \u2032 \u2192 \u2212k \u2032 the right-hand basic vectors change too: n \u2192 \u2212n,\nm \u2192 l and l \u2192 m.\n\n4\n\n\fnfl/fl\n\nbe seen, the experimental Rdp (0) and estimated rCEX (0) data are very similar to the PSA solutions,\nand practically coincide with the FA91 one. Without the proper unitary transformation this agreement\ndisappears (the PSA curve in Fig. 8 in [18]).\nnfl/fl\n\nTable 2: Rdp (0) and rCEX (0) results and their total errors \u03b5tot\nTn GeV\n\n0.55\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.7\n\n1.8\n\n2.0\n\nRdp\n\u03b5tot\n\n0.589\n0.046\n\n0.554\n0.023\n\n0.553\n0.026\n\n0.551\n0.022\n\n0.576\n0.038\n\n0.565\n0.038\n\n0.568\n0.033\n\n0.564\n0.045\n\nrnfl/fl\n\u03b5tot\n\n0.133\n0.088\n\n0.204\n0.051\n\n0.206\n0.057\n\n0.209\n0.048\n\n0.158\n0.077\n\n0.179\n0.080\n\n0.174\n0.068\n\n0.183\n0.094\n\nRdp \u2212 energy dependence\n\nr nfl/fl \u2212 energy dependence\n\n1\n\u25a0\n\nWorld Data\n\n\u25bc\n\nJINR LHE (DELTA - SIGMA)\n\n\u25a0\n\nWorld Data\n\n\u25bc\n\nJINR LHE (DELTA - SIGMA)\nJINR LHE (Glagolev et al.)\n\n0.8\n\nJINR LHE (Glagolev et al.)\n\nR.Binz , DRSA for np\u2192pn(0)\n\nr nfl/fl values\n\nRdp values\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\nVZ40\nFA91\n\n0.4\n\nSP07\n\nFA91\nVZ40\n\nCEX(0)\n\nCEX(0)\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\nSP07 CEX(0)\n\n0\n0\n\n0.25\n\n0.5\n\n0.75\n\n1\n\n1.25\n\n1.5\n\n1.75\n\n2\n\n0\n\nNeutron beam energy, GeV\n\n0.25\n\n0.5\n\n0.75\n\n1\n\n1.25\n\n1.5\n\n1.75\n\n2\n\nNeutron beam energy, GeV\n\nFigure 1: Energy dependence of the ratio Rdp (0) between the yields of the nd \u2192 p (nn) quasi elastic and\nnp \u2192 pn elastic charge exchange reactions.
