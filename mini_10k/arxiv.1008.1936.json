This function is\nrelevant for resummations of large perturbative logarithms in collider processes involving\nlow-mass gluon jets. The jet function corresponds to the imaginary part of the gluon\npropagator in light-cone gauge, which is adopted for the calculation. In addition to the\nleading jet function, the power-suppressed two-gluon jet functions are given and their\nrenormalization is discussed.\n\n\f1\n\nThe gluon jet function\n\nCross sections for the production of low-mass jets at large momentum transfer often factorize\ninto hard, jet and soft functions [1, 2]. While the hard functions encode the physics associated\nwith the large momentum transfer Q, the jet functions describe the propagation of collinear\npartons inside the jets. The soft functions mediate low energy interactions between jets and\nhave a low characteristic scale M 2 /Q, where M is the typical invariant mass of the jets.\nSoft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) implements this factorization on the operator level\n[3, 4, 5]. In this framework the hard functions appear as Wilson coefficients of operators built\nout of soft and collinear fields. At leading power, the operators do not contain soft fields and\nthe soft interactions can be decoupled from the effective Lagrangian. After the decoupling,\nthe soft functions are given by matrix elements of light-like Wilson lines along the directions\nof large energy flow. The matrix elements of the collinear fields associated with the final state\ndefine the jet functions. The collinear fields associated with the initial state at hadron colliders\ndefine (generalized) parton distribution functions, also called beam functions [6]. By solving\nthe renormalization group (RG) equations of the hard, jet and soft functions, one can resum\ncontributions to jet cross sections which are logarithmically enhanced by ratios of the different\nscales.\nMost of the early applications of SCET were concerned with processes mediated by electroweak currents with only two directions of large energy flow. Such processes involve only quark\njets. The corresponding jet function was computed to two-loop order already some time ago\n[7]. The gluon jet function first appeared in computations of radiative \u03a5 decays [8, 9, 10], but\nmore generally, it appears in any process involving gluon jets. This includes any jet process at\nhadron colliders and the production of three or more jets at e+ e\u2212 machines. The jet function\nis given by the vacuum matrix element of two gluon fields,\nZ\nX\nd4 x eipx h0| Aa\u03bc(x)Ab\u03bd (0) |0i =\n(2\u03c0)4 \u03b4 (4) (p \u2212 pX ) h0| Aa\u03bc(0) |XihX| Ab\u03bd (0)|0i .\n(1)\nX\n\nLoosely speaking, it measures the probability that a gluon field produces a jet of particles\nwith momentum p from the vacuum. The field A\u03bc (x) is the gluon field in light-cone gauge. It\nis related to the field A\u03bc (x) in a general gauge via\nA\u03bc (x) = Aa\u03bc (x)ta = W \u2020 (x) [iD \u03bc W (x)] .\n\n(2)\n\nThe light-like (n2 = 0) Wilson lines\n\u0012 Z\nW (x) = P exp igs\n\n0\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nds n * A(x + sn)\n\n\u0013\n\n(3)\n\nensure that the jet function is invariant under gauge transformations which vanish for x \u2192 \u221e.\nThe symbol P indicates path ordering, and the conjugate Wilson line W \u2020 is defined with\nthe opposite ordering prescription. In SCET the jet function is defined as a matrix element\nof collinear fields which describe the propagation of energetic particles with small invariant\nmasses p2 \u226a (n * p)2 . However, after decoupling the soft fields, the collinear Lagrangian is\n1\n\n\fequivalent to the QCD Lagrangian. For the computation of the matrix element (1) we may\ntherefore use QCD Feynman rules.\nThe one-loop result for the gluon jet function was given in [11], where it was used to perform\nsoft-gluon resummation for direct photon production at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic\n(NNLL) accuracy. Without too much effort it should be feasible to push the logarithmic\naccuracy for vector boson production processes even one order higher. Based on the results\nof [12, 13] (see also [14, 15]), the necessary three-loop anomalous dimensions were derived in\n[11]. The two-loop hard functions are also known and can be extracted from the results of\n[16, 17]. The only missing ingredients to perform a N3 LL resummation for W , Z and photon\nproduction at large transverse momentum are the two-loop results for the soft function and\nthe gluon jet function. In the present paper, we compute the gluon jet function at two-loop\norder.\nIn addition to the inclusive jet function considered in this work, it is also interesting to\nstudy jet functions that incorporate kinematical restrictions on the final state X which appears\nin (1). Such jet functions become relevant when a jet-algorithm is applied to the final state.\nThe one-loop quark jet function for Sterman-Weinberg jets has recently been computed in\n[18], and both quark and gluon jet functions for general recombination and cone algorithms\nhave been worked out in [19] (for related work cf. [20, 21]).\nThe most general parameterization of the gluon jet function consistent with the identity\nn * A(x) = 0 and invariance under a rescaling of the light-cone vector n\u03bc reads\nZ\n\nd4 x eipx h0| Aa\u03bc(x)Ab\u03bd (0) |0i\n=\u03b4\n\nab\n\ngs2 \u03b8(p0 )\n\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\nn\u03bc p\u03bd + p\u03bc n\u03bd\nn\u03bc n\u03bd\n2\n2\n\u2212g\u03bc\u03bd +\nJg (p ) +\nKg (p ) , (4)\nn*p\n(n * p)2\n\nwhere the strong coupling constant gs on the right-hand side is the bare coupling. In the\nconstruction of SCET one introduces a conjugate light-cone vector n\u0304\u03bc with n\u0304 * n = 2 and\ndecomposes the gluon field as\nA\u03bc (x) = A\u03bc\u22a5 (x) +\n\nn\u03bc\nn\u0304 * A(x) ,\n2\n\n(5)\n\nwith n\u0304 * A\u22a5 (x) = n * A\u22a5 (x) = 0. The jet function Jg (p2 ) then corresponds to the matrix\nelement of two transverse fields A\u03bc\u22a5 (x). Since the component n\u0304 * A(x) is suppressed in the\nlimit p2 \u226a (n*p)2 , only the function Jg (p2 ) is relevant in leading-power factorization theorems.\nHowever, independence of the reference vector n\u0304\u03bc ensures that the field components always\nappear in the combination (5) and for completeness we will compute the full two-point function,\nincluding the power-suppressed piece Kg (p2 ).\nIn the following section, we will discuss the technical aspects of the two-loop computation\nand present the bare, unrenormalized, two-loop results. As a check of our calculation, we have\nperformed the computation both in Feynman and light-cone gauge. The renormalization of\nthe jet functions is discussed in Section 3. As an interesting aside, we discuss the choice of\nthe operator basis necessary to renormalize the power-suppressed jet function Kg (p2 ).\n2\n\n\f2\n\nTwo-loop calculation\n\nIn order to calculate the jet function, it is convenient to rewrite (4) as the imaginary part of\nthe time-ordered product\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\nZ\n\b a\nn\u03bc p\u03bd + p\u03bc n\u03bd\nn\u03bc n\u03bd\n4\nipx\nb\nab 2\n2\n2\n\u2212g\u03bc\u03bd +\nd x e h0| T A\u03bc (x)A\u03bd (0) |0i = \u03b4 gs\nJg (p ) +\nKg (p )\nn*p\n(n * p)2\n(6)\nwith\nJg (p2 ) =\n\n\u0003\n1 \u0002\nIm iJg (p2 ) ,\n\u03c0\n\nKg (p2 ) =\n\n\u0003\n1 \u0002\nIm iKg (p2 ) .\n\u03c0\n\n(7)\n\nThis form shows that the jet function is given by the imaginary part of the gluon propagator\nin light-cone gauge n * A(x) = 0, where the Wilson lines become trivial and A\u03bc (x) = gs A\u03bc (x).\nFor dimensional reasons, the function Jg (p2 ) \u223c (p2 )\u22121 , while Kg (p2 ) \u223c (p2 )0 . Thus only Jg (p2 )\nreceives contributions from single-particle intermediate states, while Kg (p2 ) starts at one-loop\nand has a cut for p2 > 0 but no pole.\nSince the Wilson lines are absent in light-cone gauge, it is convenient to use this gauge in\nthe computation of the jet function. The free gluon propagator in light-cone gauge is given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\nn\u03bc p\u03bd + n\u03bd p\u03bc\ni\n\u2212g\u03bc\u03bd +\n.\n(8)\np2 + i0\nn*p\nNote that we are not adopting the Mandelstam-Leibbrandt (ML) prescription to regulate the\nn * p \u2192 0 singularity. The ML prescription [22, 23]\nn\u0304 * p\n1\n\u2192\nn*p\nn * p n\u0304 * p + i0\n\n(9)\n\ncures the collinear singularity in the propagator, but in SCET this singularity has a physical meaning. The Wilson line W (x) and the associated light-cone propagators arise from\nexpanding QCD diagrams around the large-energy limit and the choice of the i0-prescription\nis dictated by the QCD diagrams. The loop integrals contributing to the jet function are unambiguously defined in dimensional regularization. They depend on a single four momentum\np. If they involve k light-cone propagators they scale as (n * p)\u2212k . Since the dependence on\nn * p is analytic, the final result of the integral is independent of the sign of the i0-prescription\nadopted for the light-cone propagator.\nAs a check of our result we performed the calculation both in light-cone and Feynman\ngauge. Both gauges offer some advantages, but overall the light-cone gauge computation is\nmore efficient. The number of diagrams in this gauge is significantly smaller, because no\nWilson line diagrams and no ghost-loop contributions need to be included. At one-loop the\nlight-cone gauge calculation reduces for instance to the first two diagrams in Figure 1. At\ntwo-loop order, the light-cone gauge calculation involves the diagrams shown in Figure 2,\nwhile the number of diagrams is again more than doubled in Feynman gauge. Furthermore,\nin light-cone gauge, standard tools for QCD computations can be used, e.g. we generate the\ndiagrams with FeynArts [24]. The only disadvantage of light-cone gauge is the proliferation of\n3\n\n\fFigure 1: Diagrams contributing to the gluon jet function at one-loop. In light-cone gauge the\nghost contribution, represented by the third diagram, as well as the diagrams in the second\nrow, which involve emissions from the Wilson lines (denoted by the crosses), are absent.\nlight-cone denominators. In the diagrams in Figure 2 each gluon propagator has an associated\nlight-cone denominator, while in Feynman gauge such denominators only arise from Wilson\nlines.\nThe most general two-loop integral that appears in the light-cone gauge calculation has\nthe form\nZ\n\nd\n\nd k\n\n\u00d7\n\nZ\n\ndd l\n\n1\n(k 2 )a1\n\n(l2 )a2\n\n(n\u0304 * l)\n\nA2\n\n[(k \u2212\n\nl)2 ]a3\n\n[(k + p)2 ]b1 [(l + p)2 ]b2 [(k + l + p)2 ]b3\n1\n\n(n\u0304 * k)\n\nA1\n\n(n\u0304 * k \u2212 n\u0304 * l)\n\nA3\n\n(n\u0304 * k + n\u0304 * p)B1 (n\u0304 * l + n\u0304 * p)B2 (n\u0304 * k + n\u0304 * l + n\u0304 * p)B3\n(10)\n\nThis class of integrals contains more master integrals than those which appeared in the twoloop computation of the quark jet function [7]. Nevertheless, after using partial-fractioning\nidentities and symmetry relations, no additional master integrals remain after solving the\nintegration-by-parts relations [25] for the integrals which actually appear in the diagrams.

For |L| < 1, the two-loop corrections amount to \u00b10.4%. To gauge\ntheir phenomenological relevance, we have included the corrections into the resummed result\nfor the direct photon cross section [11]. At the Tevatron, and for pT = 50 GeV, the change in\nthe cross section due to the inclusion of the two-loop gluon jet function is around +1%, while\nthe two-loop corrections from the hard and soft functions (which are, however, only partially\nknown) are both around +5%.\n\n3.2\n\nThe subleading jet function Kg (p2)\n\nWhile there exists only one physical operator at leading power, we need to include additional\npower-suppressed operators to perform the renormalization of the subleading jet function.\nThis is obvious, since Kg (p2 ) vanishes at tree level, but is divergent at one-loop order. To\ndiscuss renormalization, it is convenient to work with the scalar operators\n\u2212g\u03bc\u03bd \b a\nT A\u03bc (x) Ab\u03bd (0) ,\nd\u22122\n\b\nOK (x) = T \u2202 * Aa (x) \u2202 * Ab (0) + \u0003 OJ (x) ,\n\nOJ (x) =\n\n(29)\n\nwhose vacuum matrix elements give rise to the jet functions Jg (p2 ) and Kg (p2 ), respectively.\nIn d = 4 dimensions, OJ (x) \u223c 1/x2 and OK (x) \u223c 1/x4 , so the second operator is powersuppressed with respect to the first one.\nFor our purposes it is sufficient to concentrate on power-suppressed two-gluon operators,\nwhich mix into operators with more than two fields, but not vice versa. Starting from the leading operator OJ , infinitely many power-suppressed two-gluon operators can be constructed.\nExamples include\nO1 (x) = \u2212\u0003 OJ (x) , O2 (x) =\n\n\u2202\n4\nOJ (x) , O3 (x) = 4 2 OJ (x) .\n+ i0\n\u2202x\n\n\u2212x2\n\n8\n\n(30)\n\n\fIn Laplace space one finds that the vacuum matrix elements of these operators are\n\u2202\ne\nj1 (Q2 ) = e\u03b3E Q4 2 e\njg (Q2 ) = O(\u03b1s ) ,\n\u2202Q\nZ 2\n\u0001 Q \u2032 2 \u2032 2 \u0001\u2212\u01eb\ne\u03b3E Q2\n2\n2\n\u03b3E\n2 \u01eb\ne\ne\n+ O(\u03b1s ) ,\nj2 (Q ) = e\nQ\ndQ Q\njg (Q\u2032 ) =\n1\u2212\u01eb\n0\n\n(31)\n\ne\nj3 (Q2 ) = e\u03b3E Q2 e\njg (Q2 ) = e\u03b3E Q2 + O(\u03b1s ) ,\n\nwhere e\njg is the leading (bare) jet function. Notice that, at tree-level, e\nj1 vanishes and the\ne\ne\ndifference j2 \u2212 j3 also vanishes in d = 4 dimensions. Since the operators O1 , O2 and O3\nhave the same field content, including spin structure, their physical matrix elements cannot\nbe distinguished and it is therefore sufficient to include an arbitrary linear combination with\nnon-vanishing tree-level matrix element in the operator basis. If several of such operators are\nincluded, the renormalization scheme can always be chosen such that only one combination\nhas a non-vanishing renormalized matrix element. In this sense the additional operators\nare similar to evanescent operators which appear in matching computations onto four-quark\noperators [33]. However, in contrast to this case, we are not forced to include the additional\noperators to obtain a basis which closes under renormalization.\nFrom (31) it is obvious, that the simplest choice corresponds to only including the operator\nO3 . In momentum space, the corresponding jet function is just the integral over the leading\njet function,\nZ p2\n2\n2\n2\ndp\u2032 Jg (p\u2032 ) .\n(32)\nJ3 (p ) =\n0\n\nFor completeness, let us also give the momentum space representation of O2 , which reads\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f1\n\u0012 \u2032 2 \u0013 d\u22122\nZ \u221e\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f2\n2\n2\np\n2\n\u20322\n2\n\u20322\nJ2 (p ) =\nJg (p ) .\n(33)\nJ3 (p ) +\ndp\n\uf8fe\nd\u22122\uf8f3\np2\np2\n\nNote that the integral in the second term is not ultraviolet convergent in d = 4 dimensions\nand can thus not be performed on the level of the renormalized jet function Jg (p2 , \u03bc). A\nsimilar behavior has been observed in convolution integrals relevant for power corrections to\nthe process B\u0304 \u2192 Xs \u03b3 [34]. Subleading quark jet functions have recently been studied in\n[35], where it was noticed that an operator basis which includes only the equivalent of O1 is\ninsufficient to perform renormalization. It was further speculated whether the operator basis\ncloses under renormalization if O3 is added. Our discussion makes it clear that this is the\ncase, as far as additional operators related to the leading jet function are concerned.\nLet us now discuss the renormalization of the two subleading jet functions e\nkg and e\nj3 . The\nrenormalized jet functions are obtained as\n!\n!\n!\ne\ne\nZj\u0303g 0\nj3\nj3bare\n=\n.\n(34)\ne\ne\nZkj Zkk\nkg\nkgbare\n9\n\n\fThe first row follows from the fact that e\nj3 = e\u03b3E Q2e\njg and that the leading operator e\njg cannot\nmix into the subleading operator. Of the two other coefficients only Zkj enters at one-loop\norder, and we find\nC A \u03b1s 1\nZkj = \u2212\n,\n(35)\n\u03c0 \u01eb\nand\n\u0013\n\u0012\nQ2\nCA \u03b1s 2 \u03b3E\n2\ne\n(36)\nQe\n1 \u2212 ln 2 .\nkg (Q , \u03bc) =\n\u03c0\n\u03bc\n\nTo obtain the renormalized result at two loops, we would need to compute the renormalization\nfactor Zkk at one-loop order. To separate out corrections associated with Zkk from the ones\nproportional to Zkj , one would need to compute a matrix element which is sensitive to the\nspin of the gluon fields in the operators. The simplest possibility is to compute a one-gluon\nmatrix element of the operator OK at one-loop.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nWe computed the gluon jet function at two-loop order. Performing the calculation in both\nFeynman and light-cone gauge, we argued that the latter leads to considerable simplifications.\nThe current calculation yields one of the two missing ingredients to perform the N3 LL softgluon resummation for W , Z and photon production at large transverse momentum. In\naddition, we computed the subleading two-gluon jet functions and discussed how to construct\na minimal basis of power-suppressed operators which closes under renormalization.\nAcknowledgments: This work is supported in part by funds provided by the Schweizerischer\nNationalfonds (SNF).
