Introduction\nIn this article we combine techniques from real algebraic geometry, convex geometry,\nand the unitary representation theory of discrete groups to address various problems\nwhich arise in the emerging field of non-commutative real algebraic geometry [15].\nClassical results \u2013 like Artin's solution of Hilbert's 17th problem \u2013 strive for a characterization of natural notions of positivity in terms of algebraic certificates. For example, Artin proved that every polynomial in n variables, which is positive at every\npoint on Rn , must be a sum of squares of rational functions. Much later, Schm\u00fcdgen\n1\n\n\f2\n\nTIM NETZER AND ANDREAS THOM\n\n[14] proved that a strictly positive polynomial on a compact semi-algebraic set must\nbe a sum of squares of polynomials plus defining inequalities. More recently, similar\nquestions were asked in a non-commutative context. Typically, the setup involves\na \u2217-algebra A and a family of representations F . The question is now: Is every\nself-adjoint element of A, which is positive (semi-)definite in every represention in F\nP\nnecessarily of the form i a\u2217i ai for some ai \u2208 A? It turned out \u2013 similar to the more\nP\nclassical commutative case \u2013 that the cone \u03a32 A = { i a\u2217i ai | ai \u2208 A} \u2282 A is an interesting object of study in itself. Natural questions are: Is \u03a32 (A) \u2229 (\u2212\u03a32 A) = {0}?\nIs \u03a32 A closed in a natural topology? Does it contain interior points?\nThe question for interior points of cones has the following motivation. If a cone C\nhas an (algebraic) interior point q, then for every point a \u2208 C \u2228\u2228 from the double\ndual, one has a + \u01ebq \u2208 C, for all \u01eb > 0 (see for example Proposition 1.3 in [6] for\na proof of this well-known fact). Using the standard GNS-construction, this yields\nthe following Positivstellensatz for unital \u2217-algebras:\nTheorem. Assume that q is an interior point of the cone \u03a32 A. If a = a\u2217 \u2208 A is\npositive semidefinite in each \u2217-representation of A, then a + \u01ebq \u2208 \u03a32 A for all \u01eb > 0.\nOur first main result is a different Positivstellensatz (Theorem 3.12): we prove that\neach element from a real reduced unital \u2217-algebra, which is positive in every generalized representation, is necessarily in \u03a32 A. The notion of a generalized representation\ninvolves an extension of the standard real and complex numbers to more general realand algebraically closed fields.\nA natural and vast class of examples of \u2217-algebras is given by complex group algebras\nC[\u0393] of discrete countable groups. We study the cones \u03a32 C[\u0393] and \u03a32 \u03c9(\u0393) in more\ndetail, where \u03c9(\u0393) \u2282 C[\u0393] denotes the augmentation ideal, see Section 4. The\nsituation for \u03c9(\u0393) is much more complicated, as the study is closely related to\nquestions about first cohomology with unitary coefficients.We prove that \u03a32 \u03c9(\u0393)\nhas a interior point if and only if H1 (\u0393, C) = 0. The cone \u03a32 \u03c9(\u0393) has interior\npoint in the l1 -metric if \u0393 has Kazhdan's property (T), and the converse holds if\nH2 (\u0393, C) = 0 (see Section 5). In Section 6, we analyze the situation for free groups\nmore closely and reprove Theorems of Schm\u00fcdgen and Helton.\nAlong the way we prove some new and powerful separation theorems in Sections 2\nand 3. The Hahn-Banach separation theorems for convex sets only apply if additional conditions on the involved sets are imposed; sets have to be closed or have\nto have non-empty interiour etc. We can remove all additional assumptions on the\n\n\fREAL CLOSED SEPARATION THEOREMS\n\n3\n\nexpense of enlarging the target R to some real closed extension of the real numbers,\nsee Theorem 2.1.\n\n2. A Real Closed Separation Theorem for Convex Sets\nThroughout we will work with various real closed fields R and always assume that\nR \u2282 R. The following is a first general separation theorem for convex cones.\nTheorem 2.1. Let V be an R-vector space, C \u2282 V a convex cone and x 6\u2208 C. Then\nthere exists a real closed field R containing R, and an R-linear functional \u03c6 : V \u2192 R,\nsuch that\n\u03c6(x) < 0 and \u03c6(y) \u2265 0 \u2200y \u2208 C.\nWe can even ensure \u03c6(y) > 0 for all y \u2208 C \\ (C \u2229 \u2212C) . Also, R does only depend\non V , not on x or C.\nProof. Let us first assume that V is finite-dimensional. We construct a complete\nflag of subspaces V = H1 \u2283 H2 \u2283 * * * \u2283 Hn = C \u2229 \u2212C, starting with V = H1 ,\nin the following way. By the standard separation theorem for convex sets (see for\nExample Theorem 2.9 in [1]) we choose a non-trivial R-linear functional \u03c6i : Hi \u2192 R\nsuch that \u03c6(y) \u2265 0 for all y \u2208 C \u2229 Hi and \u03c6i (x) \u2264 0 (if x \u2208 Hi ). We then define\nHi+1 := Hi \u2229 {\u03c6i = 0} and iterate the process. We finally extend each \u03c6i in any way\nto V . Now let R be a real closed extension field of R. Choose positive elements\n1 = \u01eb1 > \u01eb2 > * * * > \u01ebn\u22121 > 0\nfrom R such that k * \u01ebi < \u01ebi\u22121 for all k \u2208 R. Then define\n\u03c6 := \u01eb1 \u03c61 + * * * + \u01ebn\u22121 \u03c6n\u22121 .\nOne checks that \u03c6 has the desired properties. This proves the claim in case of finite\ndimension.\nIn the general case, consider the set S of all finite dimensional subspaces H of V .\nFor each H \u2208 S choose \u03c6H : H \u2192 R, separating x from C \u2229 H as desired (if x \u2208 H).\nExtend \u03c6H in any way to V . Now let \u03c9 be an ultrafilter on S, containing the sets\n{H \u2208 S | y \u2208 H}, for all y \u2208 V . Consider the linear functional \u03c6 : V \u2192 R\u03c9 ,\n\u03c6(v) = (\u03c6H (v))H\u2208S . Here R\u03c9 denotes the ultrapower of R with respect to \u03c9.\nOne checks that \u03c6 separates x as desired, by the Theorem of Los (see for example\nTheorem 2.2.9 in [11]).\n\u0003\n\n\f4\n\nTIM NETZER AND ANDREAS THOM\n\nRemark 2.2. In the usual way, one can now also deduce that any two convex disjoint\nsets in a vector space can be separated as above with a real-closed valued affine\nfunctional.\nIt turns out that we can also extend functionals quite often, if we allow for an\nextension of the real closed field.\nTheorem 2.3. Let V be an R-vector space, C \u2286 V a convex cone and H \u2286 V a\nsubspace. Assume (C + H) \u2229 \u2212(C + H) = H. Then for any real closed extension\nfield R of R and any R-linear functional \u03c6 : H \u2192 R with \u03c6 \u2265 0 on C \u2229 H there is\nsome real closed extension field R\u2032 of R and an R-linear functional \u03c6 : V \u2192 R\u2032 with\n\u03c6 \u2265 0 on C and \u03c6 = \u03c6 on H. We can even ensure \u03c6(y) > 0 for all y \u2208 C \\ H.\nProof. We apply Theorem 2.1 to the convex cone C + H in V , and obtain a real\ne and a nontrivial R-linear functional \u03c8 : V \u2192 R\ne with \u03c8 = 0 on H\nclosed field R\nand \u03c8(y) > 0 for a \u2208 C \\ H. By amalgamation of real closed fields we can assume\ne Let finally R\u2032 be a real closed extension field\nwithout loss of generality that R = R.\nof R that contains an element \u03b4 > R. Extend \u03c6 to an R-valued funtional on V and\nset\n\u03c6 := \u03c6 + \u03b4 * \u03c8.\nIt is clear that \u03c6 coincides with \u03c6 on H and also that \u03c6(y) > 0 for all y \u2208 C \\ H. \u0003\nWe will improve upon the separation results in the case of certain \u2217-algebras in the\nnext section.\n3. Completely Positive Separation\nThroughout this section let A be a C-algebra with involution \u2217, not necessarily\nunital. We consider the cone of sums of hermitian squares\n( n\n)\nX\n\u03a32 A =\na\u2217i ai | n \u2208 N, ai \u2208 A ,\ni=1\n\ncontained in the real vector subspace of hermitian elements\nAh = {a \u2208 A | a\u2217 = a} .\n\nIf b \u2208 Ah \\ \u03a32 A, we find an R-linear functional \u03c6 : Ah \u2192 R, into some real closed\nextension field R of R, such that \u03c6(b) < 0, \u03c6(a\u2217 a) \u2265 0 for all a \u2208 A, by Theorem 2.1\nfrom the last section. We can extend \u03c6 uniquely to a C-linear functional \u03c6 : A \u2192 R[i]\nfulfilling \u03c6(a\u2217 ) = \u03c6(a). We will denote the algebraically closed field R[i] by C from\nnow on.\n\n\fREAL CLOSED SEPARATION THEOREMS\n\n5\n\nThe condition \u03c6(a\u2217 a) \u2265 0 for all a \u2208 A is called positivity of \u03c6. We would now like\npositive and real-closed valued functionals to fulfill the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality\n|\u03c6(a\u2217 b)|2 \u2264 \u03c6(a\u2217 a)\u03c6(b\u2217 b)\nfor all a, b \u2208 A. This is however not true in general, as shows the next example.\nExample 3.1. Let A = C[t] be the univariate polynomial ring, where \u2217 is coefficientwise conjugation. The cone \u03a32 A equals the cone of nonnegative real polynomials.\nConsider the functional\n\u03c6 : R[t] \u2192 R,\n\np 7\u2192 p(0) + \u01ebp\u2032\u2032 (0),\n\nwhere \u01eb \u2208 R is positive and infinitesimal with respect to R. One checks that \u03c6 is\npositive, but for a = 1 + t2 and b = 1 we have\n|\u03c6(a\u2217 b)|2 = 1 + 4\u01eb + 4\u01eb2 > 1 + 4\u01eb = \u03c6(a\u2217 a)\u03c6(b\u2217 b).\nExample 3.2. The last example can be modified to even fulfill \u03c6(a\u2217 a) > 0 if a 6= 0.\nIndeed let 1 = \u01eb0 > \u01eb1 > \u01eb2 > * * * > 0 be a sequence of elements from R, such that\nP\n(2i)\n(0) is well-defined\nR * \u01ebi < \u01ebi\u22121 for all i. Then the linear mapping p 7\u2192 \u221e\ni=0 \u01ebi * p\nand strictly positive in the desired sense. If we further assume R * \u01eb2 < \u01eb21 , then the\nsame argument as in Example 3.1 shows that the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is not\nfulfilled.\nDefinition 3.3. A C-linear functional \u03c6 : A \u2192 C with \u03c6(a\u2217 ) = \u03c6(a) is called\ncompletely positive, if for all m \u2208 N, the componentwisely defined function\n\u03c6(m) : Mm (A) \u2192 Mm (C)\nmaps sums of hermitian squares to positive semidefinite matrices.\nRemark 3.4. It is easily seen that a positive C-linear functional \u03c6 : A \u2192 C with\n\u03c6(a\u2217 ) = \u03c6(a) is always completely positive.\nExample 3.5. The functionals from Example 3.1 and Example 3.2!are positive, but\n1 a\nnot completely positive. Indeed, with a = 1 + t2 and M =\nwe find that\n0 0\n!\n1\n\u03c6(a)\n\u03c6(2) (M \u2217 M) =\n\u03c6(a\u2217 ) \u03c6(a\u2217 a)\nis not positive semidefinite, since its determinant is negative in R.\n\n\f6\n\nTIM NETZER AND ANDREAS THOM\n\nLemma 3.6. A C-linear functional \u03c6 : A \u2192 C with \u03c6(a\u2217 ) = \u03c6(a) is completely\npositive if and only if the C-linear extension\nid \u2297 \u03c6 : C \u2297C A \u2192 C\nis positive.\nProof. The condition that id \u2297 \u03c6 is positive is\n!\u2217\nm\nX\n0 \u2264 (id \u2297 \u03c6)\nzj \u2297 aj\nj=1\n\n= (id \u2297 \u03c6)\n=\n\nX\nj,k\n\nX\nj,k\n\nz j zk \u2297 a\u2217j ak\n\n!\n\nm\nX\nj=1\n\nzj \u2297 aj\n\n!!\n\nz j zk * \u03c6(a\u2217j ak )\n\nfor all m \u2208 N, zj \u2208 C, aj \u2208 A.

Since every sum of hermitian\nsquares in Mm (A) is a finite sums of such rank one squares, this proves the claim. \u0003\nCorollary 3.7.

We see from the last proof that in fact only the 2-positivity of \u03c6 is\nneeded for the Cauchy-Schwarz-inequality.\nCorollary 3.9. Let A be a C-algebra with involution and R a real closed field\nwhich contains R. Let \u03c6 : A \u2192 C be a completely positive C-linear functional which\nsatisfies \u03c6(a\u2217 ) = \u03c6(a) for all a \u2208 A.

Let A be a C-algebra with involution, not necessarily unital. Then\nP\nA is called real reduced if i a\u2217i ai = 0 implies ai = 0 for all i and ai \u2208 A.\n\nTheorem 3.11. Let A be a C-algebra with involution, that is real reduced. Let\nb \u2208 Ah \\ \u03a32 A. Then there is real closed extension field R of R and a completely\npositive C-linear functional \u03c6 : A \u2192 C with \u03c6(a\u2217 ) = \u03c6(a), such that\n\u03c6(b) < 0\n\nand\n\n\u03c6(a\u2217 a) > 0 for a \u2208 A \\ {0}.\n\nProof. For any finite dimensional subspace H of A denote by\n(\n)\nX\n\u03a32 H =\na\u2217i ai | ai \u2208 H\ni\n\nthe set of sums of hermitian squares of elements from H. It is a well-known fact that\n\u03a32 H is a closed convex cone in a finite dimensional subspace of Ah . This follows\nfrom the fact that A is real reduced, using for example the approach from [10],\nespecially Lemma 2.7 from that work. It also follows that \u03a32 H is salient, i.e. fulfills\n\u03a32 H \u2229 \u2212\u03a32 H = {0}.\nSo for each such H there is an R-linear functional \u03c6H : Ah \u2192 R with\n\u03c6(b) < 0 and \u03c6H (a\u2217 a) > 0 for all a \u2208 H \\ {0}.\n\n\f8\n\nTIM NETZER AND ANDREAS THOM\n\nLet S be the set of all finite dimensional subspaces H of A, equipped with an\nultrafilter \u03c9 containing all the sets {H \u2208 S | c \u2208 H}. Define\n\u03c6 : Ah \u2192 R\u03c9 ;\n\n\u03c6(a) := (\u03c6H (a))H\u2208S .\n\nThen \u03c6 does the separation as desired. We consider the C-linear extension of \u03c6 to\nA, and finally show that it is completely positive. The C-linear extension of \u03c6H\nto A indeed maps a matrix (a\u2217i aj )i,j \u2208 Mn (A) to a positive semidefinite hermitian\nmatrix, at least if all ai \u2208 H, as is easily checked (compare to Remark 3.4). Since\nwe can check positivity of the matrix (\u03c6(a\u2217i aj ))i,j \u2208 Mn (R\u03c9 [i]) componentwisely in\nMn (R[i]), by the Theorem of Los, this finishes the proof.\n\u0003\nThroughout, we will take the freedom to consider \u2217-representations of A on vector\nspaces which carry a sesqui-linear C-valued inner product, where C = R[i] for some\nreal closed field R \u2283 R. We call these representations generalized representations.\nFor every completely positive functional \u03c6 : A \u2192 C we can perform the usual GNSconstruction to construct such a representation (see the proof of Theorem 6.1 below\nfor more technical details). The usual concepts of self-adjointness and positive semidefiniteness of operators on such a vector space can be defined without any problems.\nThe first consequence is the following Positivstellensatz (compare to the standard\nPositivstellensatz from the introduction):\nTheorem 3.12. Let A be a real reduced unital \u2217-algebra, and a \u2208 Ah . Then a is\npositive semidefinite in every generalized representation if and only if a \u2208 \u03a32 A.\nProof. If a \u2208\n/ \u03a32 A, then there exists a completely positive map \u03c6 : A \u2192 C, such\nthat \u03c6(a) < 0. Clearly, a will not be positive semidefinite in the generalized GNSrepresentation associated with \u03c6.\n\u0003\nExamples for real reduced unital \u2217-algebras are group algebras C[\u0393]. In Section 6,\nwe will see that for particular groups the study of generalized representations of C[\u0393]\ncan be reduced to the study of usual (finite-dimensional) unitary representations,\nusing Tarski's transfer principle.\n4. Sums of Squares in the Group Algebra\nLet \u0393 be a group and let C[\u0393] denote the complex group algebra. A typical element\nP\nin C[\u0393] is denoted by a = g ag g, where only finitely many of the ag \u2208 C are not\nzero. In C[\u0393] we identify C with C * e, where e denotes the neutral element of \u0393.\nP\nP\nThe group algebra comes equipped with an involution ( g ag g)\u2217 := g \u0101g g \u22121 and a\nP\ntrace \u03c4 : C[\u0393] \u2192 C, which is given by the formula \u03c4 ( g ag g) = ae . The trace shows\n\n\fREAL CLOSED SEPARATION THEOREMS\n\n9\n\nthat C[\u0393] is real reduced. Let \u03a32 C[\u0393] denote the set of sums of hermitian squares\nin C[\u0393]. The following appears for example as Example 3 in [5]:\nP\nLemma 4.1. kak21 \u2212 a\u2217 a \u2208 \u03a32 C[\u0393] for all a \u2208 C[\u0393], where kak1 = g |ag |.\n\nRemark 4.2. From the identity\n\n2kak1 * (kak1 \u2212 a) = (kak1 \u2212 a)\u2217 (kak1 \u2212 a) + (kak21 \u2212 a\u2217 a)\nfor a \u2208 C[\u0393]h we see that 1 is an algebraic interior point of the cone \u03a32 C[\u0393] in the\nreal vector space C[\u0393]h . That means 1+\u01eba \u2208 \u03a32 C[\u0393] for all a \u2208 C[\u0393]h and sufficiently\nsmall \u01eb > 0. In fact, the \u01eb does only depend on kak1 here.\nRemark 4.3. As explained in the introduction, for any element a \u2208 C[\u0393]h that is\npositive semidefinite in each (usual) \u2217-representation of C[\u0393] one thus has a + \u01eb \u2208\n\u03a32 C[\u0393], for all \u01eb > 0.\nRemark 4.4. Since C[\u0393] is real reduced and unital, the result of Theorem 3.12 holds\nhere as well. So if a is positive semidefinite in each generalized representation, then\na \u2208 \u03a32 C[\u0393].\nWe now consider the augmentation homomorphism \u03b5 : C[\u0393] \u2192 C which is defined\nP\nP\nby \u03b5( g ag g) = g ag . The augmentation ideal is\n(\n)\nX\n\u03c9(\u0393) := ker(\u03b5) = a \u2208 C[\u0393] |\nag = 0 .\ng\n\nWe set c(g) := g \u2212 1 and note that {c(g) | g \u2208 \u0393 \\ {e}} is a basis of \u03c9(\u0393). The\nmultiplication satisfies\nc(g)c(h) = c(gh) \u2212 c(g) \u2212 c(h).\nWe denote by \u03c9 2 (\u0393) the square of \u03c9(\u0393), i.e. \u03c9 2 (\u0393) = spanC {ab | a, b \u2208 \u03c9(\u0393)}. Inside\n\u03c9(\u0393), we study the cone of sums of hermitian squares\nnX\no\n2\n\u2217\n\u03a3 \u03c9(\u0393) :=\nai ai | ai \u2208 \u03c9(\u0393) .\n\nWe are interested in interior points of this cone. Note that \u03a32 \u03c9(\u0393) \u2282 \u03c9 2(\u0393) and\n\u03c9(\u0393)/\u03c9 2(\u0393) = C \u2297Z \u0393ab , where \u0393ab = \u0393/[\u0393, \u0393] and [\u0393, \u0393] denotes the subgroup of\n\u0393 which is generated by commutators. Hence, if \u0393 has non-torsion abelianization,\nthen \u03a32 \u03c9(\u0393) is contained in a proper subspace of \u03c9(\u0393). We will however show below\nthat \u03a32 \u03c9(\u0393) always has an interior point in \u03c9 2 (\u0393)h .\nLemma 4.5. For any group, \u03a32 \u03c9(\u0393) = \u03a32 C[\u0393] \u2229 \u03c9(\u0393)\n\n\f10\n\nTIM NETZER AND ANDREAS THOM\n\nP\nProof. The inclusion \u03a32 \u03c9(\u0393) \u2282 \u03a32 C[\u0393] \u2229 \u03c9(\u0393) is obvious. If i a\u2217i ai \u2208 \u03c9(\u0393) with\nP\n2\nai \u2208 C[\u0393], then\ni |\u03b5(ai )| = 0 and hence \u03b5(ai ) = 0 for all i. This proves the\nconverse inclusion.\n\u0003\nRemark 4.6. It turns out that we can always extend positive functionals \u03c6 on \u03c9(\u0393)\nto positive functionals \u03c6 on C[\u0393], at least if we allow for an extension of the real\nclosed field. Indeed observe\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03a32 C[\u0393] + \u03c9(\u0393)h \u2229 \u2212 \u03a32 C[\u0393] + \u03c9(\u0393)h = \u03c9(\u0393)h ,\n\nwhich follows immediately from an application of the augmentation homomorphism\n\u03b5. We can thus apply Theorem 2.3.\n\nLemma 4.7. Let R be a real closed extension field of R, and \u03c6 : \u03c9(\u0393) \u2192 C a\ncompletely positive C-linear functional with \u03c6(a\u2217 ) = \u03c6(a) for all a \u2208 \u03c9(\u0393). Then\nfor all s, h \u2208 \u0393\n1\n|\u03c6(c(s)\u2217 c(h))| \u2264 \u221a * (\u03c6(c(s)\u2217 c(s)) + \u03c6(c(h)\u2217 c(h))) .\n2\n\u03c6(c(sh)\u2217 c(sh)) \u2264 2 * (\u03c6(c(s)\u2217 c(s)) + \u03c6(c(h)\u2217 c(h))) .\nProof. The first inequality is an application of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality (that\n2\nis fulfilled by completely positive functionals) and the inequality \u03bb\u03bc \u2264 (\u03bb+\u03bc)\n. For\n2\nthe second inequality first apply the triangle identity from Corollary 3.9 to the\nequation\nc(sh) = c(s) + (c(s)c(h) + c(h)) ,\ntogether with the well-known inequality (a + b)2 \u2264 2(a2 + b2 ). Then use the easy to\nverify identity kc(s)c(h) + c(h)k2 = kc(h)k2 .\n\u0003\nSince 1 \u2208\n/ \u03c9(\u0393), we need to find a different candidate for an interior point of \u03a32 \u03c9(\u0393).\nDefinition 4.8. Let S \u2282 \u0393 be a finite symmetric set, i.e. S \u22121 = S. We define the\nLaplace operator on S to be\nX\n\u2206(S) := |S| \u2212\ns\ns\u2208S\n\nRemark 4.9. Note that for every finite symmetric set S \u2282 \u0393\n1 X\nc(s)\u2217 c(s) \u2208 \u03a32 \u03c9(\u0393).\n\u2206(S) = *\n2 s\u2208S\nProposition 4.10. Let \u0393 be a group, generated by a finite symmetric set S. Then\nfor any b \u2208 \u03c9 2 (\u0393) there exists a constant C(b) \u2208 R, such that for any real closed\n\n\fREAL CLOSED SEPARATION THEOREMS\n\n11\n\nextension field R of R and any completely positive C-linear functional \u03c6 : \u03c9(\u0393) \u2192 C\nwith \u03c6(a\u2217 ) = \u03c6(a) for all a \u2208 \u03c9(\u0393), one has\n|\u03c6(b)| \u2264 C(b) * \u03c6(\u2206(S)).\nProof. Every element b \u2208 \u03c9 2 (\u0393) is a finite linear combination of c(g)\u2217 c(h), for\ng, h \u2208 \u0393 \\ {e}. This implies that |\u03c6(b)| is bounded by a universal constant times\nmax{\u03c6(c(s)\u2217 c(s)) | s \u2208 S}, using Lemma 4.7 several times. However,\nmax{\u03c6(c(s)\u2217 c(s)) | s \u2208 S} \u2264 2 * \u03c6(\u2206(S))\nfollows from Remark 4.9. This proves the claim.\n\n\u0003\n\nTheorem 4.11. Let \u0393 be a group with finite generating symmetric set S. Then for\nevery b \u2208 \u03c9 2 (\u0393)h there is a constant C(b) \u2208 R such that\nC(b) * \u2206(S) \u00b1 b \u2208 \u03a32 \u03c9(\u0393).\nIn particular, \u2206(S) is an inner point of the cone \u03a32 \u03c9(\u0393) in \u03c9 2 (\u0393)h . If H1 (\u0393, C) = 0,\nit is an inner point in \u03c9(\u0393)h .\nProof. In view of Proposition 4.10 we find that\nC(b) * \u2206(S) \u00b1 b\nis nonnegative under each completely positive real-closed valued C-linear functional\n\u03c6 on \u03c9(\u0393). In view of Theorem 3.11 this means that C(b) * \u2206(S) \u00b1 b is a sum of\nhermitian squares in \u03c9(\u0393). Note that we use that \u03c9(\u0393) is real reduced. Finally note\nthat H1 (\u0393, C) = 0 just means that \u03c9 2(\u0393) = \u03c9(\u0393).\n\u0003\n5. Groups with Kazhdan's Property (T)\nWe want to show that the constant C(b) from Theorem 4.11 can be chosen as a\nfixed multiple of kbk1 , in case the group \u0393 has Kazhdan's property.\nDefinition 5.1.

It is also known that for a fixed finite symmetric and generating set S in\na Kazhdan group \u0393 there is some \u01eb > 0 such that for any unitary representation\n\u03c0 : \u0393 \u2192 U(H) without fixed vectors one has\nh\u2206(S)\u03be, \u03bei \u2265 \u01eb * k\u03bek2\n\nfor all \u03be \u2208 H.\n\nSuch \u01eb is called a Kazhdan constant for S.\nLet's revisit the standard GNS-representation in the context of \u03c9(\u0393). Let \u03c6 : \u03c9(\u0393) \u2192\nC be a positive linear functional with \u03c6(a\u2217 ) = \u03c6(a). We associate to \u03c6 a Hilbert\nspace as follows. We define on \u03c9(\u0393) a positive semi-definite sesqui-linear form\nha, bi\u03c6 := \u03c6(b\u2217 a)\n1/2\n\nand set kak\u03c6 := ha, ai\u03c6 .

We denote the image\nof c(g) in L2 (\u03c9(\u0393), \u03c6) by \u03b4(g) and denote by \u03b4(\u0393) their complex linear span, which is\ndense by definition of L2 (\u03c9(\u0393), \u03c6)). It is a standard fact the the left-multiplication\nof \u03c9(\u0393) on itself extends to a homomorphism \u03c0 \u03c6 : \u03c9(\u0393) \u2192 D(\u03b4(\u0393)), where D(\u03b4(\u0393))\ndenotes the algebra of densely defined linear operators mapping \u03b4(\u0393) into itself.\nIndeed, if a \u2208 N(\u03c6) and b \u2208 \u03c9(\u0393), then ba \u2208 N(\u03c6) since\n\u03c6((ba)\u2217 ba) = \u03c6(a\u2217 b\u2217 ba) \u2264 kbk21 * \u03c6(a\u2217 a)\nby Lemma 4.1.

If \u03c9 2 (\u0393) = \u03c9(\u0393), then the representation \u03c0\u03c6 has no fixed vectors.\nProof. Assume \u03b7 \u2208 L2 (\u03c9(\u0393), \u03c6) is a fixed vector. By definition of \u03c0\u03c6 , this means\n\u03c0 \u03c6 (c(g))\u03b7 = 0, for all g \u2208 \u0393. Hence,\n0 = h\u03c0 \u03c6 (c(g \u22121))\u03b7, \u03b4(h)i\u03c6 = h\u03b7, \u03b4(gh) \u2212 \u03b4(g) \u2212 \u03b4(h)i\u03c6 .\n\n\fREAL CLOSED SEPARATION THEOREMS\n\n13\n\nSince c(g)c(h) = c(gh) \u2212 c(g) \u2212 c(h), the vectors \u03b4(gh) \u2212 \u03b4(g) \u2212 \u03b4(h) span the image\nof \u03c9 2 (\u0393) in \u03b4(\u0393) and hence \u03b4(\u0393) since \u03c9 2 (\u0393) = \u03c9(\u0393).\n\u0003\nNote that the map g 7\u2192 \u03b4(g) satisfies\n\u03b4(gh) = \u03c0\u03c6 (g)\u03b4(h) + \u03b4(g)\nand hence defines a 1-cocycle with respect to the representation \u03c0\u03c6 . If \u0393 is a Kazhdan\ngroup, then there exists \u03a9 \u2208 L2 (\u03c9(\u0393), \u03c6) such that\n\u03b4(g) = \u03c0\u03c6 (g)\u03a9 \u2212 \u03a9.\nProposition 5.4. Let \u0393 be a Kazhdan group with finite symmetric generating set S\nand Kazhdan constant \u01eb > 0. Then for every b \u2208 \u03c9(\u0393)h , every real closed extension\nfield R of R and every positive nontrivial C-linear functional \u03c6 : \u03c9(\u0393) \u2192 C with\n\u03c6(a\u2217 ) = \u03c6(a) one as\n\u01eb * \u03c6(b) < 2kbk1 * \u03c6(\u2206(S)).\nProof. Let us first assume R = R and C = C. We do the GNS construction as just\ndescribed, and get some \u03a9 \u2208 L2 (\u03c9(\u0393), \u03c6) with \u03b4(g) = \u03c0\u03c6 (g)\u03a9 \u2212 \u03a9, for all g \u2208 \u0393. We\nset\n\u03c6 : C[\u0393] \u2192 C; \u03c6(a) = h\u03c0\u03c6 (a)\u03a9, \u03a9i\nand compute:\n\u03c6\u0304(c(h)\u2217 c(g)) = h\u03c0\u03c6 (c(g))\u03a9, \u03c0\u03c6 (c(h))\u03a9i\u03c6\n= h\u03b4(g), \u03b4(h)i\u03c6\n\n= \u03c6(c(h)\u2217 c(g)).\nThis shows that \u03c6\u0304 and \u03c6 agree on \u03c9 2 (\u0393) and hence on \u03c9(\u0393). If we now do the\nstandard GNS-construction with respect to \u03c6, we see that there is a natural \u0393equivariant identification of L2 (C[\u0393], \u03c6\u0304) and L2 (\u03c9(\u0393), \u03c6). Since the representation\n\u03c0\u03c6 has no fixed vectors we get\n\u03c6(\u2206(S)) = \u03c6(\u2206(S)) = h\u2206(S)1, 1i\u03c6 \u2265 \u01eb * \u03c6(1).\nSince \u03c6 is positive and nontrivial, it follows from Remark 4.2 that \u03c6(1) > 0. So\nfinally, again using Remark 4.2 we find\n\u01eb * \u03c6(b) = \u01eb * \u03c6(b) \u2264 \u01eb * kbk1 * \u03c6(1) < 2kbk1 * \u03c6(\u2206(S)),\nthe desired result.\n\n\f14\n\nTIM NETZER AND ANDREAS THOM\n\nNow let R be arbitrary and \u03c6 : \u03c9(\u0393) \u2192 C positive and nontrivial. From Theorem\n4.11 it follows that \u03c6(\u2206(S)) > 0. So we can assume without loss of generality that\n\u03c6(\u2206(S)) = 1. Again from Theorem 4.11 we see that \u03c6 now only takes values in\nO[i], where O is the convex hull of R in R. It is well known that O is a valuation\nring in R with maximal ideal m, and that O/m = R. The residue map O \u2192 O/m\nmaps nonnegative elements to nonnegative elements. So if we compose \u03c6 with the\nresidue map on O[i], we get a positive linear functional to C. Since we know that\nthe desired strict inequality holds now, it was already valid for \u03c6.\n\u0003\nTheorem 5.5. Let \u0393 be a group with finite generating symmetric set S. Consider\nthe statements:\n(1) \u0393 has Kazhdan's property (T).\n(2) \u2206(S) is an algebraic interior point of \u03a32 \u03c9(\u0393) in the l1 -metric of \u03c9(\u0393)h . More\nprecisely, there exists a constant \u01eb > 0, such that for every b \u2208 \u03c9(\u0393)h with\nkbk1 = 1 we have\n\u2206(S) + \u01eb * b \u2208 \u03a32 \u03c9(\u0393).\nThe following implications hold: (1) implies (2) and (2) implies (1) under the additional assumption H2 (\u0393, C) = 0.\nProof. Implication (1) \u21d2 (2) is a direct consequence Theorem 3.11 and Proposition\n5.4. Let us now prove (2) \u21d2 (1) under the additional assumption H2 (\u0393, C) = 0. We\nfirst prove two lemmas.\nLemma 5.6. Let \u0393 be a group. There is an exact sequence as follows:\n0 \u2192 H2 (\u0393, C) \u2192 \u03c9(\u0393) \u2297C[\u0393] \u03c9(\u0393) \u2192 \u03c9(\u0393) \u2192 H1 (\u0393, C) \u2192 0\nProof. It is well-known that\n\u03c9(\u0393)/\u03c9(\u0393)2 = \u0393ab \u2297Z C = H1 (\u0393, C).\nThis shows exactness at \u03c9(\u0393) and it remains to show exactness at \u03c9(\u0393) \u2297C[\u0393] \u03c9(\u0393).\nSince 0 \u2192 \u03c9(\u0393) \u2192 C[\u0393] \u2192 C \u2192 0 is exact, we have\nC[\u0393]\n\nH2 (\u0393, C) = H1 (\u0393, \u03c9(\u0393)) = Tor1\n\n(C, \u03c9(\u0393)).\n\nAgain, we get an exact sequence\nC[\u0393]\n\nTor1\n\nC[\u0393]\n\n(C[\u0393], \u03c9(\u0393)) \u2192 Tor1\n\n(C, \u03c9(\u0393)) \u2192 \u03c9(\u0393) \u2297C[\u0393] \u03c9(\u0393) \u2192 C[\u0393] \u2297C[\u0393] \u03c9(\u0393).\nC[\u0393]\n\nThis finishes the proof since Tor1\n\n(C[\u0393], \u03c9(\u0393)) = 0.\n\n\u0003\n\n\fREAL CLOSED SEPARATION THEOREMS\n\n15\n\nIf \u2206(S) is an algebraic interior point of \u03a32 \u03c9(\u0393) in \u03c9(\u0393)h , then \u03c9(\u0393) = \u03c9 2(\u0393), i.e.\nH1 (\u0393, C) = 0. Hence H2 (\u0393, C) = 0 ensures that the natural map\n\u03c9(\u0393) \u2297C[\u0393] \u03c9(\u0393) \u2192 \u03c9(\u0393)\nis an isomorphism. This is what we are going to use.\nLemma 5.7. Let \u03c0 : \u0393 \u2192 U(H) be a unitary representation and \u03b4 : \u0393 \u2192 H be a\n1-cocycle with respect to H. Then,\n\u03c6(c(h)\u2217 \u2297 c(g)) := h\u03b4(g), \u03b4(h)i\nyields a well-defined positive linear functional on \u03c9(\u0393) = \u03c9(\u0393) \u2297C[\u0393] \u03c9(\u0393).\nProof. It is clear that (c(h)\u2217 , c(g)) 7\u2192 h\u03b4(g), \u03b4(h)i defines a bilinear map on \u03c9(\u0393), i.e.\na linear map \u03c6\u2032 : \u03c9(\u0393)\u2297C \u03c9(\u0393) \u2192 C. We show that this map passes to \u03c9(\u0393)\u2297C[\u0393] \u03c9(\u0393).\nLet g, h, k \u2208 \u0393, then\n\u03c6\u2032 (c(h)\u2217 k \u2297 c(g)) = \u03c6\u2032 (c(h\u22121 )k \u2297 c(g))\n\n= \u03c6\u2032 ((c(h\u22121 k) \u2212 c(k)) \u2297 c(g))\n\n= \u03c6\u2032 (c(k \u22121 h)\u2217 \u2297 c(g)) \u2212 \u03c6\u2032 (c(k \u22121 )\u2217 \u2297 c(g))\n= h\u03b4(g), \u03b4(k \u22121h)i \u2212 h\u03b4(g), \u03b4(k \u22121)i\n= h\u03b4(g), \u03c0(k \u22121)\u03b4(h)i\n= h\u03c0(k)\u03b4(g), \u03b4(h)i\n= h\u03b4(kg), \u03b4(h)i \u2212 h\u03b4(k), \u03b4(h)i\n\n= \u03c6\u2032 (c(h)\u2217 \u2297 c(kg)) \u2212 \u03c6\u2032 (c(h)\u2217 \u2297 c(k))\n\n= \u03c6\u2032 (c(h\u2217 ) \u2297 kc(g)).\n\nWe can now understand \u03c6\u2032 as a linear map on \u03c9(\u0393), via the above isomorphism to\n\u03c9(\u0393) \u2297C[\u0393] \u03c9(\u0393). Since a\u2217 a corresponds to a\u2217 \u2297 a one easily checks that \u03c6 is positive\non \u03c9(\u0393).\n\u0003\nWe continue with the proof of Theorem 5.5. Condition (2) in Theorem 5.5 and\nLemma 5 imply that any 1-cocycle with respect to any unitary representation is\nbounded. This is well-known to imply Kazhdan's property (T) for \u0393.\n\u0003\nRemark 5.8. It is not clear whether the condition H2 (\u0393, C) = 0 is necessary.\n\n\f16\n\nTIM NETZER AND ANDREAS THOM\n\nThere is an analogue of the implication (1) \u21d2 (2) in Theorem 5.5 in l1 \u0393 :=\nP\nP\nk.k1\n{ g\u2208\u0393 ag g | g\u2208\u0393 |ag | < \u221e}.

A priori, there is no reason to assume that \u03a32,1 l1 \u0393 or \u03a32,1 \u03c9 1 \u0393 are closed\nor have non-trivial interiour. Nevertheless, our result shows:\nCorollary 5.9. Let \u0393 be a Kazhdan group with finite generating symmetric set S\nand Kazhdan constant \u01eb. Then for every b \u2208 \u03c9 1 (\u0393)h with kbk1 = 1 we have\n\u2206(S) + \u03b5 * b \u2208 \u03a32,1 \u03c9(\u0393).\n6. Group Algebras of Free Groups\nDuring this section let \u0393 = Fn be the free group on n generators g1 , . . . , gn or\n\u0393 = F\u221e . Schm\u00fcdgen [16] has proven that an element from the group algebra\nC[\u0393] that is nonnegative under each finite dimensional \u2217-representation is a sum\nof squares. We demonstrate how his result can be re-proven with our real closed\nseparation approach. The main idea of our proof is the same as in Schm\u00fcdgen's work.\nHowever, instead of a partial GNS-construction we use a full GNS-construction, but\nover a general real closed field. We then reduce to the standard real numbers by\nTarski's transfer principle.\nTheorem 6.1 (Schm\u00fcdgen). Let \u0393 = Fn be the free group on n generators. If\nb \u2208 C[\u0393]h is mapped to a positive semidefinite matrix under each finite dimensional\n\u2217-representation of C[\u0393], then b \u2208 \u03a32 C[\u0393].\nProof. Assume that b \u2208\n/ \u03a32 C[\u0393]. By Theorem 3.11 there is a real closed extension\nfield R of R and a completely positive C-linear functional \u03c6 : C[\u0393] \u2192 C with \u03c6(a\u2217 ) =\n\n\fREAL CLOSED SEPARATION THEOREMS\n\n17\n\n\u03c6(a), such that \u03c6(b) < 0. By Lemma 3.6, the canonical C-linear extension of \u03c6 to\nA = C \u2297C C[\u0393] is still positive, and we denote it again by \u03c6. We apply the usual\nGNS-construction to A. We note that\nN = {a \u2208 A | \u03c6(a\u2217 a) = 0}\nis a \u2217-subspace of the C-vector space A, which follows from the Cauchy-Schwarz\ninequality, as shown in Corollary 3.9. We denote the quotient space A/N by H, and\nnote that\nha + N, c + Ni\u03c6 := \u03c6(c\u2217 a)\nis a well-defined and positive definite C-valued sesqui-linear form on H. We also\nnote that left-multiplication from C[\u0393] on A is well-defined on H, as explained in\nSection 5. So we have a C-linear \u2217-representation\n\u03c0 : C[\u0393] \u2192 L(H)\nwith h\u03c0(b)\u03be, \u03bei\u03c6 < 0, where \u03be = 1 + N.\nNow let H \u2032 be a finite dimensional \u2217-subspace of H, containing the residue classes of\nall words in the generators gi of length at most d, where d is the maximal word length\nin b. We can choose an orthonormal basis v1 , . . . vm of H \u2032 , using the usual GramSchmidt procedure over C. So there is an orthogonal projection map p : H \u2192 H \u2032,\ndefined as\nm\nX\np : h 7\u2192\nhh, vi ivi .\ni=1\n\nDefine\n\nMi := p \u25e6 \u03c0(gi ) \u2208 L(H \u2032).\n\np\nIt is easy to see that all Mi are contractions, and thus the linear operators 1 \u2212 Mi\u2217 Mi\np\nand 1 \u2212 Mi Mi\u2217 exist on H \u2032. Using Choi's matrix trick [4, Theorem 7], we define\n!\np\nMi\nI \u2212 Mi Mi\u2217\nUi := p\n\u2208 L(H \u2032 \u2295 H \u2032).\n\u2217\n\u2217\nI \u2212 Mi Mi\n\u2212Mi\n\nThe Ui are checked to be unitary operators, and thus yield a C-linear \u2217-representation\n\u03c0\ne of C[\u0393] on H \u2032 \u2295 H \u2032 . Since the residue classes of all words occuring in b belong to\nH \u2032 , and by the definition of the Ui , we find\nhe\n\u03c0 (b)\u03be \u2032 , \u03be \u2032iH \u2032 \u2295H \u2032 = h\u03c0(b)\u03be, \u03bei\u03c6 < 0,\n\n\f18\n\nTIM NETZER AND ANDREAS THOM\n\nwhere \u03be \u2032 = (\u03be, 0). Now finally, since H \u2032 \u2295 H \u2032 is finite dimensional, the existence\nof such a representation over C implies the existence over C, by Tarski's transfer\nprinciple. This finishes the proof.\n\u0003\nRemark 6.2. The proof becomes even simpler when considering the \u2217-algebra of\npolynomials in non-commuting variables Chy1 , . . . , yn , z1 , . . . , zn i with yi\u2217 = zi , or\nChz1 , . . . , zn i with zi\u2217 = zi , instead of the group algebra of a free group. The reason\nis that one is not forced to make the matrices Mi unitary (only hermitian in the\nsecond case). So Theorem 6.1 also holds for these polynomial algebras. This was\nfirst proven by Helton [7].\nIt is an interesting problem to study the class of groups \u0393, for which positivity of\na \u2208 C[\u0393] in every finite-dimensional unitary representation implies that a \u2208 \u03a32 C[\u0393].\nIt is clear that in order for an analogous argument to work, \u0393 has to be residually\nfinite-dimensional in a very strong sense. Residual finite-dimensionality of a group\nmeans that every unitary representation on a Hilbert space can be approximated in\nthe Fell topology by finite-dimensional representations, see [3] for details. If \u2013 more\ngenerally \u2013 every generalized unitary representation of \u0393 on a Hilbert space can\nbe approximated on finitely many vectors by generalized finite-dimensional unitary\nrepresentations, then everything works. With additional work, this can be carried\nout for virtually free groups [16].\nDeep results of Scheiderer [13] imply that the conclusion holds for Z2 . However, by a\nclassical results of Rudin [9], the group Z3 does not satisfy the desired conclusion, and\nthe same holds for every group which contains Z3 . This is also implied by seminal\nwork of Scheiderer, who showed that [12, Theorem 6.2] the existence of positive\nelements which are not sum of squares under general assumptions in dimension \u2265 3.\nThis shows that the theory of generalized unitary representations is fundamentally\ndifferent and new pathologies occur.\nAn intruiging and possibly manageable case is the case of surface groups. Lubotzky\nand Shalom showed that surface groups are residually finite-dimensional [8]. It is\nquite possible that their methods extend and lead to a resolution of the case of\nsurface groups.\nConjecture 6.3. Let G be a surface group. Every element a \u2208 C[\u0393]h , which is positive semidefinite in every finite-dimensional unitary representation lies in \u03a32 C[\u0393].\nSimilar questions can be studied if one allows the unitary representations to be\ninfinite dimensional. Again, the only known obstruction is Z3 \u2282 \u0393.\n\n\fREAL CLOSED SEPARATION THEOREMS\n\n19\n\nReferences\n[1] A.
