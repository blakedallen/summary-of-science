The method allows the determination of the density\nranges where such ordered configurations are energetically favoured with respect to the usual gaseous configurations. This leads to the determination of\nthe parameters of a first order phase transition from the fluid to the crystallized state as well as the equation of state of the plasma in the ordered phase.\nWe show some preliminary results obtained by the application of the method\nto a very simplified model which shows the efficiency of the mechanism of\nconfinement of the hyperons in an ordered phase proposed here. The eventual\nexistence of such a new phase should induce changes in the structure and\ncooling of dense stars.\nAt densities about 1.5 times nuclear saturation and beyond, hyperons\nare present in hadronic matter. The equation of state taking into account the\npresence of nucleons and hyperons which interact through the exchange of several mesons has been extensively studied using phenomenological lagrangian\nmodels 1 . In the mean field approximation, the hyperonic component (as the\nother hadronic components in the ground state) is supposed to form a spatially uniformly distributed Fermi fluid undergoing the action of the mesonic\nmean field created by the whole baryonic distribution in the plasma.\nThe hadronic interaction in our model is reduced to the exchange of scalar\nand vector meson fields. Such a description is the simplest one allowing for an\nacceptable fit of nuclear saturation 2 . We consider a unique species of neutral\nhyperons. The interaction Lagrangian for every baryon species B reads\nX\nLI =\ng\u03c3B \u03a8\u03c3\u03a8 + g\u03c9B \u03a8\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c9\u03bc \u03a8\n(1)\nB=p,n,h\n\nbo: submitted to World Scientific on November 18, 2018\n\n1\n\n\fwhere the coupling constants to the meson fields are weaker for hyperons than\nfor nucleons. The leptonic sector is reduced for simplicity to the electron.\nUsing relativistic condensed matter techniques, we investigate the possibility of the existence of energetically favourable solid configurations, where\npairs of antiparallel spin hyperons are confined on the nodes of a regular lattice\nin the ground state of the hadronic plasma. In this situation the hyperons\nshould behave as impurities which induce a redistribution of the surrounding nucleons. Nevertheless, as a first approximation to the solution for the\ndynamics of the nucleon in the medium, we consider the lattice of neutral\nhyperons as a uniform background, in an analogous way to the \"free electron\nmodel\" in a Coulomb lattice 4 .\nIn evaluating the energetic contribution of a crystal array of hyperons\nsurrounded by the nucleon liquid component in the plasma, the hyperons are\nassumed to be localized on the nodes of a cubic lattice under the action of their\nmutual interaction and the mean fields created by the surrounding nucleons.\nIn this way the total potential at every lattice site is approximated by a\nharmonic potential which is determined selfconsistently as the superposition of\nthe potentials created by the gaussian clouds of two antiparallel spin hyperons\non all the other nodes of the lattice, to which the interaction with the mean\nfield of the nucleon sector is added. In a first approximation we neglect the\ncentral and spin-spin interaction between the hyperons in the same node. We\nshall consider such interaction in future work, but we have already verified\nthat their effect improves the confining character of the whole potential and\nfacilitates the crystallization. In calculating the lattice potential we have also\nintroduced monopolar form factors accounting for the composite structure of\nthe hyperon. In this analysis, vanishing temperature is assumed.\nFor the nucleonic background in the crystal, a relativistic Hartree approximation is used to calculate the contribution to the total energy density of the\nsystem, as in the case of the liquid ground state to which it is compared.\nThe relative abundances of protons, neutrons and hyperons can be now\nobtained by establishing the equations of \u03b2-equilibrium between all these particles. The chemical potentials of protons, neutrons and electrons are the\nFermi energies of these particles which are in Fermi gaseous phases. The\nchemical potential of the hyperons are calculated as the energy gained by the\nsystem when a new hyperon is added in the n = 1 level of the harmonic potential in a node. We need also the equations for the mean scalar and vector\nfields generated by the uniform background of nucleons. The abundance of\nhyperons resulting from this system is an ingredient in the calculation of the\npotential created by the lattice on every node.\nConsequently, for the periodic configuration the self-consistent set of equa-\n\nbo: submitted to World Scientific on November 18, 2018\n\n2\n\n\ftions for the beta equilibrium of chemical potentials in the plasma coupled to\nthe mean field equations, and the self consistent equations for the confining\nfields in the nodes are\nnelectrons = nprotons\n\n(charge neutrality)\n\n\u03bcneutrons = \u03bcprotons + \u03bcelectrons\n\u03bcneutrons = \u03bchyperons\nnbaryons\n2\nm\u03c3 < \u03c3 + \u03c3ext >\n0\nm2\u03c9 < \u03c9 0 + \u03c9ext\n>\n2\nm\u03c3 < \u03c3ext >\n0\nm2\u03c9 < \u03c9ext\n>\n\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n\n= nneutrons + nprotons + nhyperons\n= g\u03c3N < \u03a8\u03a8 > +g\u03c3H nhyperons\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\n= \u2212g\u03c9N < \u03a8\u03b3 0 \u03a8 > \u2212g\u03c9H nhyperons\n= g\u03c3H nhyperons\n\n(7)\n(8)\n\n= \u2212g\u03c9H nhyperons\n\n(9)\n\nThe crystal size cell a is related to the hyperonic density nhyperons of hyperons\npaired in a S-state.\n2\n(10)\na3\nThe solution of this system gives the magnitudes characterizing the configuration, such as crystal cell size, characteristic oscillation frequency and width\nof hyperon wave functions, the energy levels, etc as functions of the total\nbaryonic density 5 .\nIn Figure 1 we show the confining potential in a node of the hyperonic\nlattice for a set of values of the parameters of the model (a=2.2142 fm, cutoff for the scalar and vector fields, \u039b\u03c3 = 1.4 GeV, \u039b\u03c9 = 2.5 GeV, value of\nthe coupling constants g\u03c3H /g\u03c3N = 0.6, g\u03c9H /g\u03c9N = 0.65 taking the Walecka\nvalues for the meson-nucleon interaction). This figure has been obtained by\nthe self consistent solution of the equations relating the confining potential to\nthe width of the hyperonic wave function.\nFigure 2 shows the cell size in the lattice as a function of baryonic density\nobtained by asuming the solid configuration to be stable at every baryonic\ndensity.\nIt is worth mentioning that the screening effects of the nucleonic plasma\nhave to be treated properly in order to consider the modification from the\nscreened HH interaction to the vacuum one, as well as the mixing effects of\nthe hadronic fields. This work is actually in progress.\nTo determine whether the transition from a spatially uniform hyperonic\nliquid phase to an ordered one takes place inside the plasma, and the range\nof thermodynamic variables where the crystal phase is energetically favoured,\nthe free energies of both phases have to be compared.
