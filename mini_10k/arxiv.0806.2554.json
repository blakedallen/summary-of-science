The applied strategy is an extension of our treatment of the 2PI-Hartree\napproximation [24]. The procedure is also applied to the O(N ) model.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nRenormalisation invariance is a powerful concept in constructing field theoretical models describing\nphenomena in a restricted range of momenta. It imposes insensitivity requirement for the physical\npredictions to the choice of the maximal momentum if the range characterising the phenomenon\nunder investigation is much below that value. Renormalisable models represent a specific subclass\nwhere the maximal momentum could be sent to infinity. In view of triviality of scalar field theories,\nrenormalisability just ensures that high precision predictions calculated with finite (but large) cut-off\nin such models will not depend sensitively on the cut-off.\nRenormalisability criteria for perturbatively computed physical quantities as power series of the\nrenormalised couplings represent a classical piece of knowledge [1]. One constructs at every order\nalso the corresponding approximation of the counterterm Lagrangian, which cancels the cut-off dependence of some loop integrals. The renormalisation of partially resummed perturbative series is\nnontrivial because in association with the selected subset of the perturbative diagrams one has to\nperform also the resummation of appropriately chosen counterterm diagrams.\nIn the past 6-7 years considerable progress has been achieved in constructing renormalisable twoparticle-irreducible (2PI) approximate solutions of perturbatively renormalisable theories. The 2PI\nE-mail: 1 patkos@ludens.elte.hu, 2 szepzs@achilles.elte.hu\n\n1\n\n\fapproximation was developed into a valuable non-perturbative tool in studies of collective features\nof quantum field theories both in and out of equilibrium. With its help one can investigate the\nevolution of the spatial distribution of ground state field condensates as well as propagators of their\nquasi-particle excitations.\nIn a series of papers [2, 3, 4] van Hees and Knoll proved renormalisability of the 2PI approximate\nsolutions in the real time formulation of quantum field theories with help of the subtraction procedure designed by Bogoliubov, Parasiuk, Hepp, and Zimmermann (BPHZ). Their study focused on\nthe symmetric phase with no condensate in the ground state. This line was continued in 2003-04\nby Blaizot, Iancu and Reinosa [5, 6] having demonstrated iteratively that self-consistently solved\npropagator equations resum infinite subsets of different orders of the perturbation theory. Mainly\nbased on diagrammatic analysis of the iterations they also constructed the counterterms necessary\nto balance the cut-off dependence of the loop integrals appearing in the self-consistent equations.\nMoreover they pointed out the importance of the large momentum asymptotics of the propagator for\nthe determination of the cut-off dependence of the counter couplings. Related investigations were\ndone also using the auxiliary field formulation of \u03a64 theories (e.g. after Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation) [7, 8, 9] and also concentrating on the problem of gauge fixing parameter dependence of\n2PI approximation in gauge theories [10, 11].\nA complete description of how to renormalise arbitrary n-point functions derived in 2PI-formalism\nwas presented by Berges, Bors\u00e1nyi, Reinosa and Serreau in Ref. [12], also for non-vanishing expectation value of the scalar field. The detailed analysis of that paper was mainly based also on diagrammatics and explicit counterterm formulae were displayed only partially. Since then several numerical\nimplementations were reported for scalar theories [13, 14, 15] and also for QED [16, 17]. The symmetry aspects of the 2PI-formalism was investigated in [4]. It was shown that only the so-called\n\"external N-point functions\", i.e. derivatives of the effective action with respect to the mean field\nfulfill Ward identities. In particular, the self-consistent propagator differs from the external two-point\nfunction and in consequence it violates Goldstone's theorem. The validity of Ward identities was\ndiscussed recently in the context of QED in [18].\nInvestigations of the renormalisation were performed also for a related resummation scheme using local (momentum-independent) insertions, the so-called two-particle-point-irreducible (2PPI) approximations. The renormalisation of this scheme was proved using counterterms [19] and the scheme\nwas used in numerical works both in equilibrium [20] and out of equilibrium [21, 22]. Recently in\nRef. [23] a renormalisation group inspired approach was developed to investigate the connection between momentum-dependent resummation and renormalisation. There a comparison of the method\nwith renormalisation methods relying on Bethe-Salpeter-like equations was also given.\nThe purpose of the present paper is to deduce the resummed counterterms in a transparent way,\nand provide explicit formulae as far as possible for the counter couplings. In a previous paper [24]\nwe have shown for the 2PI-Hartree approximation that results of the iterative renormalisation of\nRef. [6] can be obtained also with help of a one-step substitution. In this paper we demonstrate\nfirst the applicability of our procedure to all cases where the large momentum asymptotics of the\npropagator remains the same as it was in the tree level approximation. In particular, we find that in\nsuch cases there is no need to use any auxiliary Bethe-Salpeter-like equation for the determination\nof the 4-point counter-couplings. This feature can be studied neatly on the example of the complete\ntwo-loop skeleton diagram set of the 2PI effective action in a constant, homogeneous symmetry\nbreaking background. The basic definitions and notations of the two models considered in this paper\nare introduced in Section 2. In Section 3 the construction is performed first for the case of the\n2\n\n\fone-component real field. It is applied to the more involved case of the O(N) model in Section 5.\nThe presentation will be detailed and still more compact than was the case of previous analyses.\nThe generalisation of our procedure to the case of the modified large momentum behaviour of\nthe propagator is discussed for the one-component scalar field in Section 4. It leads to a new\nimportant intermediate step in designing the algorithm of the counterterm determination. Namely,\nthe separation of the divergent pieces of different skeleton diagrams has to be based now on an\nauxiliary propagator whose asymptotics coincides with the exact large momentum behaviour and\nis independent of the possibly environment dependent infrared data (masses, condensates) of the\ntheory [6]. The exact propagator is expanded around this propagator, which eventually determines\nthe counterterms. This analysis becomes unavoidable when also the so-called \"basket-ball\" diagram\nis added to the set of skeleton diagrams determining the 2PI effective action. It is in Section 6 where\nwe extend the analysis to the O(N) model. A central question of these sections will be, how the\nform of subdivergences changes, whether all subdivergences can be expressed as products of a unique\n(possibly environment dependent) function and some explicit cut-off dependent factors, or one has to\nconsider several independent \"mixed\" products. It turns out that the relevant contribution from the\n\"basket-ball\" diagram can be decomposed into the sum of terms from which some are proportional\nto powers of the background field, some to the finite part of the tadpole integral, therefore no new\ntype of subdivergence shows up. This decomposition is determined by an integral kernel solving a\nBethe-Salpeter type equation, which introduces quite naturally a resummation for certain 4-point\nfunctions.\nAs a consequence, the classification of the divergent pieces remains unchanged relative to the\nclasses found already in the 2PI-Hartree approximation [24]: one finds overall divergences proportional to the zeroth and second power of the background field and subdivergences proportional to the\nfinite part of the independent tadpole integrals. Their coefficients are required to vanish separately.\nIn general, the number of renormalisation conditions arising from this requirement is larger than\nthe number of independent counter couplings. Renormalisability of the 2PI approximation means\nbeyond the determination of all resummed counter couplings also the demonstration that these supplementary equations do not contradict those which are used for extracting the counterterms.\nThe summary of our findings is given in Section 7 where we shortly outline possible approaches\nto renormalised (cut-off independent) numerical calculations. Some technical details relevant to the\ndiscussion presented in the main text are given in two Appendices.\n\n2\n\nThe models and some notations\n\nThe complete static O(\u03bb2 ) skeleton 2PI functional in the broken phase of the real one-component \u03a64\nmodel, characterised by the vacuum expectation value \u03a6 = v is of the following form [13]:\n\u00132\n\u0012Z\nZ\n\u0003 \u03bb\n1 2 2\n\u03bb 4 i \u0002\n\u22121\n\u22121\nV [v, G] = m v + v \u2212\nG(p)\nln G (p) + D (p)G(p) +\n2\n24\n2 p\n8\np\nZ Z\nZ Z Z\ni\u03bb2 2\ni\u03bb2\n\u2212\nG(p)G(k)G(p \u2212 k) \u2212\nG(q)G(p)G(k)G(p + k + q) + Vct [v, G], (1)\nv\n12\n48 k p q\nk p\n\n3\n\n\fwhere iD \u22121 (p) = p2 \u2212 m2 \u2212 \u03bbv 2 /2 is the tree-level inverse propagator.

Separation of the divergent pieces is explicitly presented in the Appendices. Without introducing any particular notation, the finite parts of these integrals would include\ntemperature and density dependent contributions.\nThe non-perturbative construction of the counterterms will be presented in two stages. First, we\nrestrict the discussion to the two-loop truncation of the effective actions given in (1) and (4). In\nthis case the asymptotic behaviour of the propagator remains as it is at tree-level. In a second step\nwe shall discuss the effect of adding the \"basket-ball\" diagram, which changes the large momentum\nasymptotics. We believe that the structured presentation makes more clear the algorithm underlying\nthe somewhat complex formulae and facilitates its prospective numerical implementations.\n\n3\n\nAnalysis of the two-loop truncation: one component real\nscalar field\n\nIn this truncation one omits the contribution of the last but one term of (1). The equation for the\npropagator reads as\n1\n1\n1\niG\u22121 (p) = p2 \u2212 m2 \u2212 \u03b4m22 \u2212 (\u03bb + \u03b4\u03bb2 )v 2 \u2212 (\u03bb + \u03b4\u03bb0 )T [G] \u2212 \u03bb2 v 2 I(p, G).\n2\n2\n2\n\n(9)\n\nThe large p asymptotics of the propagator is unchanged compared to the tree-level one, and we\nparametrise the finite self-energy of the exact propagator as\niG\u22121 (p) = p2 \u2212 M 2 \u2212 \u03a0(p).\n\n(10)\n\nThe splitting of the finite self-energy into the two pieces\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\nM 2 = m2 + v 2 + TF [G],\n2\n2\n\n\u03a0(p) =\n\n\u03bb2 2\nv IF (p, G),\n2\n\n\u03a0(p)\n\u2192 0,\np\u2192\u221e p2\nlim\n\n(11)\n\nseparates the momentum-dependent part of the finite self-energy (\u03a0(p)), coming from the setting-sun\nintegral of the effective-action (1) and the momentum-independent contribution (M 2 ) which comes\nfrom the other two-loop piece of V [v, G]. Although this latter term formally corresponds to the\n2PI-Hartree truncation discussed in our previous paper [24], its self-consistent determination takes\ninto account the effect of \u03a0(p).\n5\n\n\fThe divergence cancellation condition which determines the counterterms \u03b4m22 , \u03b4\u03bb2 , and \u03b4\u03bb0 is\nobtained by subtracting (10) with the parametrisation (11) from (9) and has the form:\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0 = \u03b4m22 + \u03b4\u03bb2 v 2 + (\u03bb + \u03b4\u03bb0 )Tdiv + \u03b4\u03bb0 TF [G] + \u03bb2 v 2 Idiv .\n2\n2\n2\n2\nThe equation of state reads as\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1 2\n1\n2\n2\n2\nv m + \u03b4m0 + (\u03bb + \u03b4\u03bb4 )v + (\u03bb + \u03b4\u03bb2 )T [G] + \u03bb S(0, G) = 0.\n6\n2\n6\n\n(12)\n\n(13)\n\nThe cancellation condition for the divergent pieces of this equation amounts to\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0 = \u03b4m20 + \u03b4\u03bb4 v 2 + (\u03bb + \u03b4\u03bb2 )Tdiv + \u03b4\u03bb2 TF [G] + \u03bb2 Sdiv (0, G).\n6\n2\n2\n6\n\n(14)\n\nFrom this equation one should determine \u03b4m20 , \u03b4\u03bb4 making use of the previously determined expression\nfor \u03b4\u03bb2 .\nThe regularised expressions of the counter couplings as determined from (12) and (14) give regularisation independent solutions when used in the regularised equations (9) and (13). In our discussion\nwe shall have in mind cut-off regularisation of the divergent integrals. Since the divergent part of\nthese integrals is separated using propagators which are not sensitive to the infrared features of the\ntheory, their entire zero temperature part will be subtracted.\nWith help of Appendix A one finds the following expressions for the divergent pieces of the basic\nintegrals:\n1\n(I)\n(0)\n(2)\n(0)\nIdiv = Td ,\nTdiv = Td + (M 2 \u2212 M02 )Td + \u03bb2 v 2 Td ,\n2\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011 3\n\u0010\n(I) (0)\n(I,2)\n(0)\n(0)\n(I)\n, (15)\n+ \u03bb2 v 2 Td Td + Td\nSdiv (0, G) = SP V (0) + 3Td TF + 3(M 2 \u2212 M02 ) (Td )2 + Td\n2\n(2)\n\n(0)\n\n(I)\n\n(I,2)\n\nThe cut-off dependent integrals SP V (0), Td , Td , Td , and Td\nare defined in Appendix A. M02 is\na free parameter introduced in the auxiliary propagator (91) to ensure the infrared finiteness of all\nintegrals. Exploiting the definition of M 2 given in (11) when using (15) in (12) and (14), one separates\nthe coefficients of v 0 , v 2 and of TF [G] exactly as it was done when we discussed the renormalisation\nof the 2PI-Hartree approximation [24]. The following six equations arise:\ni\nh\n1\n(2)\n(0)\n0 = \u03b4m22 + (\u03bb + \u03b4\u03bb0 ) Td + (m2 \u2212 M02 )Td ,\n2\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\n(0)\n(0)\n(I)\n+ \u03bb2 Td ,\n0 = \u03b4\u03bb2 + \u03bb(\u03bb + \u03b4\u03bb0 ) Td + \u03bbTd\n2\n1\n(0)\n0 = \u03b4\u03bb0 + \u03bb(\u03bb + \u03b4\u03bb0 )Td ,\n2\ni 1\n\u0011 1\nh\n\u0010\n1\n(2)\n(0)\n(0)\n(I)\n+ \u03bb2 SP V (0),\n0 = \u03b4m20 + (\u03bb + \u03b4\u03bb2 ) Td + (m2 \u2212 M02 )Td + \u03bb2 (m2 \u2212 M02 ) (Td )2 + Td\n2\n2\n6\n\u0011 3 \u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n3\n(0)\n(0)\n(I)\n(I)\n(I,2)\n+ \u03bb3 Td + \u03bbTd\n,\n0 = \u03b4\u03bb4 + \u03bb(\u03bb + \u03b4\u03bb2 + \u03bb2 Td ) Td + \u03bbTd\n2\n2\n\u0011\n1\n1 \u0010 (0)\n(I)\n(0)\n0 = \u03b4\u03bb2 + \u03bb(3\u03bb + \u03b4\u03bb2 )Td + \u03bb3 (Td )2 + Td ,\n(16)\n2\n2\n6\n\n\f\u0001\u0002\n\u03bb\n\nF\n\n\u03bb\n\n\u03bb\n\nF\n\n\u03bb+\u03b4\u03bb0\n\nM 2 \u2212M02\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n\u03bb\n\nFigure 1: Illustration of the appearance of the same radiative structure producing (i) the diver(I)\ngence denoted with Td in the equation for the inverse propagator and (ii) the subdivergence of the\nequation of state. Internal lines represent the auxiliary propagators GP V . Wiggly line represents the\nbackground v. Letter 'F' refers to the finite bubble contribution IP V,F .\nwhere the first three equations come from (12), while the last three from (14). The expression for\n\u03b4\u03bb0 determined from the third equation is identical to the expression which we would have obtained\nin 2PI-Hartree approximation. If one determines from the first five equations \u03b4m20 , \u03b4m22 , \u03b4\u03bb0 , \u03b4\u03bb2 ,\nand \u03b4\u03bb4 , then the sixth serves for a consistency check of the renormalisation. It can be verified by\ndirect substitution of the previously obtained counter coupling expressions. The reason behind this\nconsistency is that when the exact propagator is expanded around the auxiliary propagator the same\nintegral appears both in the momentum independent part of the self-energy and in the contribution of\nthe setting-sun to the equation of state. In the former case the divergent part of this integral denoted\n(I)\nwith Td appears as an overall divergence proportional to v 2 , which can be seen by looking at the\nlast term of Tdiv in (15). In the second case it appears also as a subdivergence, that is proportional\nto TF [G] (see the third term of Sdiv in (15)). This structural correspondence is illustrated in Fig. 1.\nWe remark that the results in (16) obtained with the present method reproduce results announced\nby Arrizabalaga and Reinosa in a conference poster [14] (explicit expressions for the counterterms\nwere given only on the poster, but not in the Proceedings). The use of these expressions in (9) and\n(13) makes these equations renormalised (cut-off independent).\n\n4\n\nAdding the \"basket-ball\" diagram\n\nKeeping all terms in the O(\u03bb2 ) truncation of the skeleton decomposition of the 2PI potential the\nfinite self-energy contains three terms:\niG\u22121 (p) = p2 \u2212 \u03a3(p),\n\u03a3(p) = M 2 + \u03a00 (p) + \u03a02 (p),\n1\n\u03bb\n1\n\u03bb2\nM 2 = m2 + \u03bbv 2 + TF [G],\n\u03a00 (p) = \u03bb2 v 2 IF (p),\n\u03a02 (p) = SF (p).\n2\n2\n2\n6\n\n(17)\n\nThe cancellation of the divergences of the propagator equation amounts to the equality\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0 = \u03b4m22 + \u03b4\u03bb2 v 2 + (\u03bb + \u03b4\u03bb0 )Tdiv + \u03b4\u03bb0 TF [G] + \u03bb2 v 2 Idiv + \u03bb2 Sdiv (p) \u2212 p2 \u03b4Z.\n2\n2\n2\n2\n6\n\n(18)\n\nThe new feature of the analysis is the fact that the large momentum behaviour of the propagator\nchanges due to the setting-sun contribution. The new leading asymptotics is accompanied also by an\ninfinite wave function renormalisation. The situation is complicated by the fact that the asymptotics\n7\n\n\fcan be determined only in the course of the numerical solution of the renormalised propagator\nequation (the equation of state has no influence on the asymptotics). Nevertheless, one proceeds by\ntreating separately the leading asymptotics not depending on any infrared parameter of the theory:\n\u03a0a (p)\n\u223c (ln p)\u03b2 ,\np\u2192\u221e\np2\n\n\u03a02 (p) = \u03a0a (p) + \u03a02,0 (p) + \u03a0r (p),\n\nlim\n\n\u03a02,0 (p)\n\u2192 0,\np\u2192\u221e\np2\nlim\n\n\u03a0r (p) \u223c p\u22122 .\n\n(19)\nThe splitting is somewhat arbitrary and this freedom can be exploited to find simple-to-handle expressions for the counter-couplings. There is a corresponding splitting of the setting-sun contribution:\nSF (p) = Sa,F (p) + S0,F (p) + Sr (p),\n\n(20)\n\nwhere Sa (p) is defined as the setting-sun diagram computed with a conveniently introduced, infrared\nstable auxiliary propagator which asymptotically coincides with the exact propagator:\n2\n2\niG\u22121\na (p) = p \u2212 M0 \u2212 \u03a0a (p),\n\nG(p) = Ga (p) + \u03b4G(p),\n\n\u03b4G(p) \u223c O(p\u22124 ).\n\n(21)\n\nWeinberg's theorem [25] guarantees that the self-consistent solution of this equation for the selfenergy (inverse propagator) behaves asymptotically as \u223c p2 (ln p)\u03b2 , where \u03b2 can be determined only\nnumerically.\nHaving introduced all the relevant notations we proceed now with the analysis of the divergences.\nThe momentum dependent divergent part of Sa (p) is removed by the wave function renormalisation\ncounterterm:\n\u03bb2 \u2202 div\n\u03b4Z =\nS (p).\n(22)\n6 \u2202p2 a\nAgain, the renormalisation of the bubble integral is the simplest:\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\n(0)\nI(p) = Idiv + IF (p),\nIdiv := Ta ,\nIF (p) = \u2212i\nG(k)G(k + p) \u2212 G2a (k) .\n(23)\nk\n\nThe tadpole integral is analysed with help of the identity given in (102)\nZ\n1 2 2 (I)\n(1)\n(2)\n2\n2\n(0)\nT [G] = Ta + (M \u2212 M0 )Ta + \u03bb v Ta \u2212 i G2a (k)\u03a02,0 (k) + TF [G].\n2\nk\n\n(24)\n\n(1)\n\nThe finite contribution denoted with TF [G] consists of two pieces. The first is the contribution of\nGr (p) and the second one is the contribution of IF (k) \u2212 Ia,F (k), which arises when in \u03a00 (k) one\n(I)\n(2)\n(0)\nreplaces IF (k) by Ia,F (k) to obtain the divergence Ta . One finds the definitions of Ta , Ta and of\n(I)\nTa in Appendix B.\nThe determination of \u03a02,0 (k) is needed to understand the contribution of the last explicit integral\nterm in the expression of T [G] given in (24). It implies the divergence analysis of S(p). With help\nof the decomposition G(p) = Ga (p) + \u03b4G(p) (see eq. (102)) one can disentangle the pieces of the\nsetting-sun integral defined in (8), which potentially contain divergences:\nZ\nS(p) = Sa (p) + 3 \u03b4G(k)Ia (k + p) + Sr(1) (p),\nSr(1) (p) \u223c p\u22122 .\n(25)\nk\n\nThe momentum dependent part of the first term determines the wave function renormalisation, as\nwe have already indicated, and also \u03a0a (p). The last term gives a contribution to \u03a0r (p).\n8\n\n\fOne identifies S0,F (p) with the contribution of the integral in (25) which is finite and does not\nvanish asymptotically for large p. Using the expression of \u03b4G given in (102), simple power counting\nshows that its Gr (k) term gives a second contribution to \u03a0r (p). Moreover, in the expression of \u03b4G(k)\none can replace IF (k) by Ia,F (k), since the difference gives a third contribution to \u03a0r (p). Taking\nin (25) the finite part of the asymptotic bubble Ia , one observes that the integral has a logarithmic\ndivergence which is captured by changing Ia,F (k +p) to Ia,F (k). It is their difference which contributes\nto S0,F (p). To improve the convergence of the integral in the ultraviolet, one exploits the symmetry\nproperty of the integrand and uses instead of Ia,F (k + p) \u2212 Ia,F (k) the kernel\ni\n\u03bb2 h\nK(p, k) =\nIa,F (k + p) + Ia,F (k \u2212 p) \u2212 2Ia,F (k) ,\n(26)\n2\nwhich is symmetric under the reflection of k \u2192 \u2212k. Note, that the kernel is not symmetric upon the\ninterchange of k and p, that is K(p, k) 6= K(k, p). This is to be contrasted with the symmetric kernel\nof Ref. [6], denoted with \u039b(p, k) which, however, is not finite.\nWith the above steps the following inhomogeneous integral representation is obtained for S0,F (p):\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\n\u03bb2 2\ni\n\u03bb2\n\u03bb2\n2\n2\n2\nG (k)K(p, k) M \u2212 M0 + v Ia,F (k) + S0,F (k) .\nS0,F (p) = \u2212\n(27)\n6\n2 k a\n2\n6\nThis can be \"inverted\" iteratively to take the form\n\u0012 Z\n\u0013\n\u0012 Z\n\u0013\n\u03bb2\n1\n1 2 2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nS0,F (p) = (M \u2212 M0 ) \u2212i \u0393(p, k)Ga (k) + \u03bb v \u2212i \u0393(p, k)Ga (k)Ia,F (k) ,\n6\n2\n4\nk\nk\nwhere the kernel \u0393(k, p) fulfills the Bethe-Salpeter-like equation\nZ\ni\nG2 (q)K(p, q)\u0393(q, k).\n\u0393(p, k) = K(p, k) \u2212\n2 q a\n\n(28)\n\n(29)\n\nThe virtue of the representation in (28) is that it decomposes S0,F (p) into the sum of terms\nproportional to v 0 , v 2 and TF [G]. It is not a solution for S0,F , since TF [G] contains it implicitly,\nbut it means that no new independent finite quantity appears in \u03a02,0 (p) relative to the analysis in\nSection 3. In other words, the subdivergences at this level are found again by looking at the coefficient\nof TF [G] in the divergence produced by \u03a02,0 (k) = \u03bb2 S0,F (p)/6 through the integral in (24).\nUsing the expression of M 2 from (17) in (28) one obtains\n\u0003 \u03bb\n1 2\nv2 \u0002\n2\n\u03a02,0 (p) = (m \u2212 M0 )\u03930 (p) +\n\u03bb\u03930 (p) + \u03bb2 \u03931 (p) + TF [G]\u03930 (p),\n2\n4\n4\nwhere for the finite integrals we introduced the following shorthand notations:\nZ\nZ\n2\n\u03930 (p) = \u2212i \u0393(p, k)Ga (k),\n\u03931 (p) = \u2212i \u0393(p, k)G2a (k)Ia,F (k).\nk\n\n(30)\n\n(31)\n\nk\n\nThe coefficients \u03930 (p) and \u03931 (p) multiplying the quantities sensitive to the infrared parameters (e.g.\nm2 \u2212 M02 , v 2, TF [G]) are fully determined by Ga (p) and have logarithmic large-p asymptotics!\nWith the expression of \u03a02,0 (p) given in (30) one returns to the expression of the tadpole integral\n(24).

Using (102) in (25)\none readily obtains:\nSdiv (p) \u2212\n\n6 2\np \u03b4Z = Sa,div (0) + 3Ta(0) (T [G] \u2212 Ta(2) )\n\u03bb2\n\u001aZ\n\u0014\n\n1\n\u22123i\n+ p) M \u2212\n+ \u03bb2 v 2 IF (k) + \u03a02,0 (k)\n2\nk\n\u0001\n= Sa,div (0) + 3Ta(0) (T [G] \u2212 Ta(2) ) + 3 M 2 \u2212 M02 Ta(I)\nZ\n3 2 2 (I,2)\n+ \u03bb v Ta \u2212 3i G2a (k)Ia,F (k)\u03a02,0 (k) ,\ndiv\n2\nk\nG2a (k)Ia,F (k\n\n2\n\nM02\n\n\u0015\u001b\n\ndiv\n\n(34)\n\nwhere T [G] is given in (33) and the divergences of the last term are expressible using (30). In going\nfrom the first to the second form of (34), we are allowed to replace both IF (k) and Ia,F (k + p) by\nIa,F (k) because the differences give finite contributions. It is remarkable that again the infrared\nquantities (m2 , M02 , v 2 , TF [G]) appear linearly with coefficients fully determined by Ga . Therefore\nthe zero temperature part of the integrals determining these coefficients will be fully included into\nthe counterterms!\nHaving the expressions of Idiv , Tdiv , and Sdiv (see (23), (33), and (34)), one substitutes into the\nlast one the definition of M 2 from (17) and one proceeds to the decomposition of the divergence\ncancellation condition for the propagator equation into the three separate equations corresponding\nto the pieces proportional to v 0 , v 2 , and TF [G], respectively:\n\u0002\n\u0003 \u03bb2\n1\n0 = \u03b4m22 + (\u03bb + \u03b4\u03bb0 ) Ta(2) + (m2 \u2212 M02 )Ta(0) + Sa,div (0)\n2\n6\n\u001a 2\u0014\n\u0015\n\u001b\n\u0001\n\u03bb\n1\n1\n2\n2\n(0) 2\n(I)\n2 (0)\n+(m \u2212 M0 )\n(Ta ) + Ta + D\u03031 + \u03bb + \u03b4\u03bb0 + \u03bb Ta D0 ,\n2\n2\n4\n\u0001\n1\n0 = \u03b4\u03bb2 + \u03bb(\u03bb + \u03b4\u03bb0 ) Ta(0) + \u03bbTa(I) + \u03bb2 Ta(0)\n2\n\u0001i\n1 3 h (0) 2\n+ \u03bb (Ta ) + Ta(I) + \u03bb Ta(0) Ta(I) + Ta(I,2)\n2\ni\n\u0001\n1 h\n+ \u03bb \u03bb + \u03b4\u03bb0 + \u03bb2 Ta(0) (D0 + \u03bbD1 ) + \u03bb2 (D\u03031 + \u03bbD2 ) ,\n4\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0001\n1\n1\n(0)\n(0)\n2\n(0) 2\n(I)\n0 = \u03b4\u03bb0 + \u03bb(\u03bb + \u03b4\u03bb0 )Ta + \u03bb Ta + \u03bb (Ta ) + Ta\n2\n2\nh\ni\n\u0001\n1\n2 (0)\n2\n+ \u03bb \u03bb + \u03b4\u03bb0 + \u03bb Ta D0 + \u03bb D\u03031 .\n4\n10\n\n(35)\n\n(36)\n\n(37)\n\n\fThe new quantities appearing in these equations are the following:\nZ\nZ\n2\nD\u03031 = \u2212i Ga (k)Ia,F (k)\u03930 (k) ,\nD2 = \u2212i G2a (k)Ia,F (k)\u03931 (k)\nk\n\ndiv\n\nk\n\ndiv\n\n.\n\n(38)\n\nNote, that D1 6= D\u03031 because the kernel K(p, k) given in (26) is asymmetric in its arguments.

The simplest way to obtain it is as follows. Denoting by Tdiv (TF ) and\nS0,div (TF ) the contribution from the tadpole and the setting-sun integrals proportional to TF [G],\nthe subdivergence cancellation in (14) reads as\n1\n1\n1\n(\u03bb + \u03b4\u03bb2 )Tdiv (TF ) + \u03b4\u03bb2 TF [G] + \u03bb2 S0,div (TF ) = 0.\n2\n2\n6\n\n(41)\n\nOne should compare this with the condition for subdivergence cancellation in the propagator equation\n(18):\n1\n1\n1\n(\u03bb + \u03b4\u03bb0 )Tdiv (TF ) + \u03b4\u03bb0 TF [G] + \u03bb2 S0,div (TF ) = 0.\n(42)\n2\n2\n6\nUsing (33), from the comparison it follows that\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u03bb\n1\n(0)\n(\u03b4\u03bb0 \u2212 \u03b4\u03bb2 ) 1 +\nTa + D0\n= 0.\n(43)\n2\n2\nIt is not obvious, when one looks at (36) and (37), that this relation is fulfilled, since when one takes\nfrom these equations the difference of the two quartic counter couplings, one finds\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\u22121 (\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03bb\n1\n1\n1\n\u03bb3\n(0)\n(I)\n(I,2)\n1+\nTa + D0\nTa + D1 + \u03bb Ta + D2\n\u03b4\u03bb0 \u2212 \u03b4\u03bb2 =\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0013\u0015 )\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n1 2\n1\n1\n1\n1\n+ \u03bb\nTa(I,2) + D2\n.

This condition\nrelates several cut-off dependent integrals which can be (and should be) checked only when the\nnumerical solutions for G(p) and for the Bethe-Salpeter-like equation (29) are found.\nWith a fully analogous line of thinking one can investigate the consistency of the cancellation\nconditions of the divergences proportional with v 0 and v 2 in the propagator equation and the equation\nof state. Using (43) the consistency requirement leads to the relations:\n\u03b4m22 = \u03b4m20 ,\n\n\u03b4\u03bb4 = 3(\u03b4\u03bb2 + \u03bb2 Ta(0) ).\n\n(46)\n\nThese two relations can be obtained also by comparing (35) with (39) and (36) with (40). Since\n(0)\n\u03b4\u03bb0 = \u22123\u03bb2 Ta /2, to O(\u03bb2 ) all three quartic coupling counterterms are equal, as is expected from\nperturbative renormalisation.\n\n5\n\nAnalysis of the O(N ) model at the two-loop level of the\ntruncation\n\nThe broken symmetry phase of the O(N) model represents a non-trivial test-ground for checking the\nconsistency of our counterterm determination. It has two independent excitations: the (N \u2212 1)-fold\ndegenerate \"pion\" multiplet and the more massive \"sigma\". Therefore there are four renormalisability\nconditions for each of the two propagators. Since from the counterterms introduced in Section 2\nonly five enter the two propagator equations, one has to check if the remaining three conditions\nare fulfilled. Although the algebra of this calculation is quite challenging with help of symbolic\ncomputer calculations we could check that the extra conditions do not impose any new relation on\nthe counterterms, being identically satisfied.\n2\n\u03c3\n\u22121\n2\n\u03c0\nThe equations for the inverse propagators iG\u22121\n\u03c3 (p) = p \u2212 \u03a30 (p) and iG\u03c0 (p) = p \u2212 \u03a30 (p) lead\nto the following equations for the respective self-energies:\n\u03a3\u03c00 (p) = m2 + \u03b4m22 + (\u03bb + \u03b4\u03bbA\n2)\n+\n\n\u03bb2 v 2\nI\u03c3\u03c0 (p),\n9N 2\n\n\u0003\n\u0001\nv2\n1 \u0002\n1\nB\n(N + 1)\u03bb + (N \u2212 1)\u03b4\u03bbA\n\u03bb + \u03b4\u03bbA\n+\n0 + 2\u03b4\u03bb0 T\u03c0 +\n0 T\u03c3\n6N\n6N\n6N\n\nB\n\u03a3\u03c30 (p) = m2 + \u03b4m22 + 3\u03bb + \u03b4\u03bbA\n2 + 2\u03b4\u03bb2\n\n+\n\n(47)\n\n\u0001 v2\n\u0001\n\u0001\nN \u22121\n1\nB\n3\u03bb + \u03b4\u03bbA\n\u03bb + \u03b4\u03bbA\n+\n0 + 2\u03b4\u03bb0 T\u03c3 +\n0 T\u03c0\n6N\n6N\n6N\n\n\u03bb2 v 2\n[9I\u03c3\u03c3 (p) + (N \u2212 1)I\u03c0\u03c0 (p)].\n18N 2\n\n(48)\n\nHere one ought to recall that the pion propagator determined self-consistently in the 2PI approximation does not obey Goldstone's theorem e.g. \u03a3\u03c00 (p = 0) 6= 0.

The\nvanishing of the divergent coefficients proportional to v 0 and v 2 provides the expressions of \u03b4m20 and\n\u03b4\u03bb4 . The consistent renormalisability of the present truncation of the 2PI-approximation depends on\nthe vanishing of the subdivergences proportional to T\u03c0,F and T\u03c3,F . There are no extra free parameters\nto ensure this.\nIn order to explicitly write the renormalisation conditions, one needs the divergences of the two\nsetting-sun integrals. To obtain them, one does the same steps as in (93) and derives expressions\nsimilar to (94) for \u03b4G\u03c3 (p) = G\u03c3 (p) \u2212 GP V (p) and \u03b4G\u03c0 (p) = G\u03c0 (p) \u2212 GP V (p), namely:\n\u0014\n\u0011\u0015\n\u03bb2 v 2 \u0010 F\n2\n2\n2\nF\n\u03b4G\u03c3 (p) = iGP V (p) M0 \u2212 M\u03c3 \u2212\n9I\u03c3\u03c3 (p) + (N \u2212 1)I\u03c0\u03c0 (p) + Gr\u03c3 (p),\n(60)\n2\n18N\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03bb2 v 2 F\n2\n2\n2\nI\u03c3\u03c0 (p) + Gr\u03c0 (p).\n(61)\n\u03b4G\u03c0 (p) = iGP V (p) M0 \u2212 M\u03c0 \u2212\n2\n9N\nThe regular parts Gr\u03c3 (p) and Gr\u03c0 (p) behave asymptotically as p\u22126 .

In what follows we review, without giving\nthe lengthy explicit expressions, how one can obtain the counterterms and the consistency conditions\nsimilar to (44).\n18\n\n\fThe vanishing of the coefficients of v 0 , v 2 , T\u03c3,F , and T\u03c0,F in the two renormalisation conditions for\nB\nG\u03c0 (p), G\u03c3 (p) results in eight conditions for the determination of five counterterms: \u03b4m22 , \u03b4\u03bbA\n0 , \u03b4\u03bb0 ,\nB\nA\nB\n2\n\u03b4\u03bbA\n2 , and \u03b4\u03bb2 .

The condition to obtain the same expressions from the renormalisation conditions of\nthe other propagator reduces to the equation\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03bb2 (N + 2) C1 Ta(0) \u2212 C0 Ta(I) \u2212 3(N + 2) (C0 D1\u03c0\u03c0 \u2212 C1 D0\u03c0\u03c0 + D1\u03c3\u03c0 D0\u03c0\u03c3 \u2212 D0\u03c3\u03c0 D1\u03c0\u03c3 )\n+6N(\u03bbC1 + NC0 ) = 0,\n(88)\nwhere Ci = (N \u2212 1)Di\u03c0\u03c3 \u2212 Di\u03c3\u03c0 . Using (87) this consistency condition is identically satisfied. The\nsame way, in order to obtain the same expression for \u03b4m22 from the vanishing of the coefficients of v 0\nin either one of the two renormalisation conditions for the propagators one needs\n\u0002 2\n\u0001\u0003 \u03c3\u03c3\n\u03bb (N + 6)Ta(0) + 6N \u03bb + \u03b4\u03bbB\n(D0 + D0\u03c3\u03c0 \u2212 D0\u03c0\u03c3 \u2212 D0\u03c0\u03c0 )\n0\n\u0010\n\u0011\n+\u03bb2 (N + 6) D\u03031\u03c3\u03c3 + D\u03031\u03c3\u03c0 \u2212 D\u03031\u03c0\u03c3 \u2212 D\u03031\u03c0\u03c0 = 0.\n(89)\n\nBy (86), this is again identically satisfied. As a partial summary we emphasise that the eight conditions renormalising the propagator equations of the O(N) model in the broken phase are algebraically\nsatisfied with the five counterterms, independent of the form of the asymptotic propagator Ga .\nTurning now to the equation of state, one can subtract its renormalisation condition from the\nrenormalisation condition of G\u03c3 , and require the cancellation of the term proportional to T\u03c3,F , T\u03c0,F ,\nv 0 and v 2 . We can easily find the following relations:\nB\nB\nA\n\u03b4\u03bbA\n2 = \u03b4\u03bb0 , \u03b4\u03bb2 = \u03b4\u03bb0 ,\n\n\u03b4m20 = \u03b4m22 ,\n\nB\n\u03b4\u03bb4 = \u03b4\u03bbA\n2 + 2\u03b4\u03bb2 +\n\n\u03bb2\n(N + 8)Ta(0) .\n3N\n\n(90)\n\nThe first two conditions above impose two consistency conditions on the coupling counterterms if\none uses their expression as obtained from the renormalisation conditions for the propagators. These\nare complicated expressions, similar to that in (44), which now depend also on N and relate several\ncut-off dependent integrals. As in the one-component case, these relations can be checked only\nnumerically.\n\n7\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper we have extended the renormalisation procedure developed in Ref. [24] to the case of\nmomentum-dependent self-energy appearing when one goes beyond the Hartree-Fock level of truncation of the 2PI effective action. Two types of momentum-dependent truncations of scalar \u03a64 type\nmodels were investigated. In the first case the asymptotic behaviour of the exact propagator remains\nunchanged relative to the tree-level, while in the second case the asymptotic behaviour of the exact\npropagator changes.\nWorking in the broken symmetry phase we introduced infrared safe auxiliary propagators having\nthe right asymptotic behaviour in order to explore the divergence structure of the model. Beyond\nthe overall divergences proportional to the zeroth and second power of the background field we found\nonly such subdivergences which were proportional to the finite part of the tadpole integrals. This\n19\n\n\fis the reason that no counterterms are needed beyond those appearing at the Hartree truncation of\nthe 2PI effective potential. Requiring the vanishing of the coefficients of independent divergences,\nwe gave explicit expressions for the counter couplings of the model in terms of some integrals of the\nauxiliary propagator.\nFor the first type of truncation investigated, our method reproduces the expressions of the counter\ncouplings which were previously reported in the literature for the case of a real selfinteracting scalar\nfield, but with no reference to any Bethe-Salpeter equation. Although, the divergence structure was\nknown in the literature for the second type of truncation, the explicit expressions for the counter\ncouplings, which are needed to make the equations of the theory finite, appear to our best knowledge\nfor the first time in this paper. These expressions depend in a non-trivial way on the solution of a\nBethe-Salpeter-like equation and can be determined only numerically. This was beyond the scope of\nour present study in which we concentrated mainly on the structural aspects of the renormalisation.\nThe proposed method treats the conditions for overall and subdivergence cancellation on equal\nfooting in the propagator equation(s) and the equation of state. Therefore, the number of conditions\nis larger than the actual number of counterterms. As shown in this paper, these conditions are\nalgebraically fulfilled for the first type of truncation, both in the case of a one-component and a\nmulti-component scalar field (O(N) model). For the second type of truncation at least some part\nof the consistency conditions can be verified only numerically. It is quite impressive, though, that\nin this case the consistency of the propagator renormalisation can be proved algebraically. In the\nexplicit demonstration the internal structure of the Bethe-Salpeter-like matrix equation plays an\nessential role. It is the compatibility of the renormalised propagator equations with the renormalised\nequation of state which leads to those consistency equations which can be verified only numerically.\nThe auxiliary propagators applied for the separation of divergences introduce also the renormalisation scale M0 . The explicit dependence of the counter couplings on this scale allows to establish the\nrenormalised trajectory of the 2PI approximation in a higher-dimensional coupling space corresponding to the larger number of independent bare couplings necessary for its consistent renormalisation\nthan in the perturbative case. Even when one restricts the beta-functions to leading (e.g. O(\u03bb2 ))\norder one finds the perturbative beta-function only for the coefficient of the v 4 term in the 2PIfunctional. It is interesting to note that beyond the perturbatively higher order contributions to the\ncounter couplings also the appearance of the asymptotic propagator Ga (p) in the relevant integrals\nproduces deviations from the perturbative behaviour of the beta-functions determined in the 2PI\napproximation.\nWhen passing to the numerical investigations the spirit of our paper suggests to make use of\nthe explicit expressions for the cut-off dependent counterterms in the cut-off regulated equations\n(for instance (9) and (13)) and verify numerically the cut-off independence of their solution. Alternatively, one can prescribe values for a number of physical quantities in terms of the renormalised\none- and two-point functions. One attempts then the determination of the asymptotic behaviour of\nthe propagator from a finite twice-subtracted dispersive representation satisfying the renormalisation\nprescriptions. Before proceeding to the solution of the self-consistent equations in the non-asymptotic\nregime one has to check the consistency relations between asymptotic integrals. Numerical investigation of these questions essential for the validity of the renormalisation methods proposed for the\n2PI approximation, will be reported elsewhere.\n\n20\n\n\fA\n\nAppendix A: Divergence structures for the two-loop\ntruncation of the 2PI approximation\n\nThe divergences of the integrals defined in (6), (7) and (8) can be most conveniently explored using Pauli-Villars type terms obtained by adding and subtracting in the integrands the auxiliary\npropagator\n2\n2\niG\u22121\n(91)\nP V (p) = p \u2212 M0 .\nThe simplest is to separate the logarithmic divergent part of the bubble integral from its finite\npart. They read as\nZ\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\n(0)\n2\n=: Td ,\nIdiv = \u2212i GP V (k)\nIF (p) = \u2212i\nG(k)G(k + p) \u2212 G2P V (k) ,\n(92)\ndiv\n\nk\n\nk\n\nwhere the divergent piece is clearly independent of the external momentum.\nFor the propagator appearing in (10) one uses the identity\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03bb2 2\n2\n2\nG(p) = GP V (p) \u2212 iG(p)GP V (p) M \u2212 M0 + v IF (p) .\n2\n\n(93)\n\nSolving (93) for G(p) and expanding it around GP V (p) this equality can be rearranged also as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03bb2 v 2\n2\n2\n2\nG(p) = GP V (p) + \u03b4G(p),\n\u03b4G(p) = \u2212iGP V (p) M \u2212 M0 +\nIF (p) + Gr (p),\n(94)\n2\nwhere Gr (p) is the regular part of the propagator, which contains at least three powers of GP V (p).\nIt behaves asymptotically as \u223c p\u22126 and produces a convergent contribution when integrated over\nmomentum.\nWith help of the representation (94) the divergences and the finite part of the tadpole integral are\neasily separable. After replacing IF (p) by IP V,F (p) in (94) (since the contribution of the difference\nto the tadpole is finite) the following partitioning is found:\nZ\n1 2 2\n(0)\n2\n2\nT [G] = T [GP V ] + (M \u2212 M0 )Td \u2212 \u03bb v i G2P V (p)IP V,F (p) + TF [G].\n(95)\n2\np\nHere one introduces the notations\nZ\nT [GP V ] = GP V (p)\np\n\ndiv\n\n=:\n\n(2)\nTd ,\n\n(I)\nTd\n\n:= \u2212i\n\nZ\n\nG2P V (p)IP V,F (p)\np\n\ndiv\n\n,\n\n(96)\n\nand obtains the first entry in (15).\nThe setting-sun integral is rewritten after the replacement G(p) = GP V (p) + \u03b4G(p) is made for\neach of the three propagators as\nZ\n(1)\nS(p = 0, G) = SP V (0) + 3 \u03b4G(k)IP V (k) + SF ,\n(97)\nk\n\nwhere SP V (0) = \u2212i\n\nR R\nk\n\nq\n\nGP V (k)GP V (q)GP V (k + q)\n\ndiv\n\n. In the integral above one decomposes IP V (k)\n(0)\n\ninto a divergent and a finite part. For the piece proportional to the divergent part IP V,div = Td\n21\n\none\n\n\fuses \u03b4G(k) = G(p) \u2212 GP V (k), while when taking the finite part of the bubble one substitutes \u03b4G(k)\nfrom (94). With help of (96) the following representation for the divergent part is obtained:\nZ\n(2)\n(0)\n(I) 3 2 2\n2\n2\nSdiv (0, G) = SP V (0)+3(T [G]\u2212Td )Td +3(M \u2212M0 )Td \u2212 \u03bb v i G2P V (k)IF (k)IP V,F (k) . (98)\ndiv\n2\nk\nThe divergent part of the integral above can be obtained by replacing IF (k) by IP V,F (k) (the difference\ngives a finite contribution). Then, introducing another cut-off dependent integral\nZ\n(I,2)\nTd\n:= \u2212i G2P V (k)IP2 V,F (k) ,\n(99)\ndiv\n\nk\n\none obtains the last entry in (15).\n\nB\n\nDivergence structures for the truncation of the 2PI approximation at O(\u03bb2) skeleton diagram level\n\nThe analysis goes quite in parallel with that given in Appendix A. One defines the basic divergent\nintegrals to be used in the exploration of the divergence structure:\nZ\nZ\n(0)\n(2)\nTa := \u2212i G2a (p) ,\nTa := Ga (p) ,\ndiv\ndiv\np\np\nZ\nZ\n2\n(100)\nTa(I,2) := \u2212i G2a (p)Ia,F\n(p) .\nTa(I) := \u2212i G2a (p)Ia,F (p) ,\np\n\ndiv\n\np\n\ndiv\n\nMaking use of (17), (19) and (21), the identity corresponding to (93) reads\n\u0002\n\u0003\nG(p) = Ga (p) \u2212 iG(p)Ga (p) M 2 \u2212 M02 + \u03a00 (p) + \u03a02,0 (p) + \u03a0r (p) .\n\nSolving (101) for G(p) and expanding around Ga (p) one obtains\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1 2 2\n2\n2\n2\nG(p) = Ga (p) + \u03b4G(p), \u03b4G(p) := \u2212iGa (p) M \u2212 M0 + \u03bb v IF (p) + \u03a02,0 (p) + Gr (p),\n2\n\n(101)\n\n(102)\n\nwhere Gr (p) contains also the contribution of \u03a0r (p). Power counting shows that for asymptotically\nlarge values of p one has Gr (p) \u223c p\u22126 .\nEq. (102) is used to separate the divergence of the tadpole integral (see (24)), also to analyse the\ndivergence structure of the momentum-dependent setting-sun integral and, eventually to obtain the\nintegral representation of S0,F (p) (e.g. \u03a02,0 (p)).\n\nAcknowledgements\nWork supported by the Hungarian Scientific Research Fund (OTKA) under Contract Nos.
