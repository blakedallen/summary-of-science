One peculiarity of all\ndensity functional based electronic structure calculations\n[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] is that, although there is strong Fe-3d As4p covalency resulting in a total width of the corresponding band complex of about 7eV, in a window of about 2.5\neV around and below the Fermi level the electronic states\nare of nearly pure Fe-3d character (Fig. 1). Mazin et al.\n[5] pointed out that there is a strong Fermi surface (FS)\nnesting in the undoped material with q = (\u03c0, \u03c0, 0) nesting wave vector between the two hole cylinders around\nthe tetragonal axis \u0393 \u2212 Z and the two electron cylinders around the axis M \u2212 A shifted by q against \u0393 \u2212 Z\n(Fig. 2). This nesting led those and several other authors\n[6, 7, 8, 9] speculate on an important role of antiferromagnetic correlations with magnetic in-plane superstructure vector (\u03c0, \u03c0), an apparently well justified scenario.\nElectron-phonon (e-p) coupling obtained on the basis of\ndensity functional perturbation theory [2, 4] yielded only\na weak coupling quite not enough to explain the high Tc .\nHowever, as is well known [10, 11] FS nesting also leads\nto phonon anomalies, and the corresponding e-p coupling\nmay not be correctly described in lowest order perturbation theory which disregards the degeneracy. Moreover,\nsince metallicity and superconductivity take place in the\nFe layers of this quasi-two-dimensional tetragonal material only (Fig. 3), an average of linearized e-p coupling\nover the whole structure might be misleading. In the\npresent text we report results of investigation of these\npoints which might be equally important compared to\nthe magnetic correlations to understand the material. It\nis indeed found that e-p coupling may be quite strong.\nHigh precision density functional calculations were performed with the local density approximation functional\nof [12] using the full-potential local-orbital code [13] in\nthe version FPLO7-28 [14] with its default orbital settings.

(The\ncenter of inversion was half-way between two neighboring Fe sites.) Doubling the unit cell of the lattice means\nfolding down the unit cell of the reciprocal lattice, the\nBrillouin zone. The original point M : q = (\u03c0, \u03c0, 0) of the\nP4/nmm lattice (Fig. 2) is folded onto \u0393 : q \u2032 = (0, 0, 0) of\nthe P4mm lattice; the folded band structure from Fig. 2 is\nshown on Fig. 5. For symmetry reasons, at q = (\u03c0, \u03c0, q3 )\nthe Fe-mode shown on Fig. 4 could only mix with a corresponding oxygen breathing mode; both are, however,\nexpected to interact only very weakly, and we neglect\nthis mixing. The total energy change due to a static displacement (frozen phonon) is shown on Fig. 4, right part.\nDespite the FS nesting the mode potential is quite harmonic, the reason for this quadratic dependence on the\nFe displacement uFe is given below. It corresponds to a\nfrequency of \u03c9Fe = 29.4meV in good agreement with the\nupper limit of the metal mode energies obtained in [2].\nNote that there are two equivalent such modes of the Fe\natoms as a rotation of the displacement vector by 90\u25e6 in\nthe left part of Fig. 4 corresponds just to an in-plane shift\nof the whole P4mm lattice by (1/2, 0, 0) which together\nwith a reflection of the c-axis is a glide symmetry element\nof the original P4/nmm lattice.\nOn Fig. 5 the bands corresponding to the undistorted\nlattice and to two static mode amplitudes, respectively,\nare shown in the downfolded P4mm zone. The common\nFermi level is again \u03b5F = 0. Now, the nesting for q \u2032 = 0 is\nseen as band crossings very close to the Fermi level (observe the energy scale of the figure) on the lines \u0393 \u2212 M\n(and \u0393 \u2212 X) and Z \u2212 R (the latter for q3\u2032 = \u03c0; the new\npoint M of the folded zone corresponds to point X on\nFig. 2.) From these bands as function of the displacement uFe of the Fe atoms, deformation potentials are\nderived. Care is, however, needed since deformation potentials are touchy entities [15]. First of all, they have\nto be determined from a common Fermi level. In the\n\nFIG. 4: Left:Displacement pattern of the Fe square\nlattice for the Fe breathing mode.

The upward\ndispersing band on the line \u0393 \u2212 M is two-fold\ndegenerate. The inset on the right shows the zoomed\ndetail from the line M \u2212 \u0393.\npresent case, moreover, reversion of uFe is equivalent to\nan in-plane shift of the whole P4mm lattice by (1, 1, 0)\nwhich is a lattice vector of the original P4/nmm lattice,\nand hence changes in band energies \u2206\u03b5kn must be even in\nuFe . Consequently, well away from band crossings there\nis no first order deformation potential, \u2206\u03b5kn \u223c u2Fe . At\ncrossing of folded bands according to the symmetry of\nthe lattice with uFe 6= 0 present (Fig. 5), gaps open with\n\u2206\u03b5gap \u223c |uFe |. In the vicinity of those crossings one has\np\n(1)\n\u2206\u03b5kn \u2248 \u00b1 (v\u2206k)2 + (IFe uFe )2 \u2213 |v\u2206k|,\n\nwhere v is the average of the two band velocities at the\ncrossing, \u2206k is the deviation from the crossing point, and\nIFe uFe is the deformation potential at the gap:\n\u2206\u03b5gap \u2248 2IFe uFe .\n\n(2)\n\nFor the displacement corresponding to one phonon per\nunit cell with energy \u03c9Fe , hu2Fe i = (2MFe \u03c9Fe )\u22121/2 one\n\n\f3\n\ng = gkn,k\u2032 n\u2032 =\n\n2\n1 IFe\nhu2Fe i\n\u2248 10meV \u2248 I2,Fe hu2Fe i\n2 20meV\n\n(3)\n\nis obtained, where I2,Fe is the corresponding second order deformation potential. Of course, whenever a phonon\nmode connects two points on the FS, this gaping with\nlattice displacement happens. However, normally it happens just for those two points without statistical weight.\nThe peculiarity here is that, as a consequence of the nesting, for one mode it happens in the vicinity of the whole\nFS in a layer of thickness \u223c \u03c9\u03bd in energy (cf. Fig. 6).\nIn the standard theory the e-p coupling strength \u03bb =\nZ(0) \u2212 1 = i(\u2202\u03a3/\u2202\u03b5)\u03b5=0 is obtained from the e-p selfenergy\nX Z d\u03c9 Z d3 k\n2\u03c9\u03bd\ng2 2\n\u03a3(\u03b5) =\nGn (\u03b5 \u2212 \u03c9, k) (4)\n3\n2\u03c0\n(2\u03c0)\n\u03c9\n+ \u03c9\u03bd2\nn\u03bd\n(n being the band index and \u03bd the phonon mode index) by treating the phonon quantities as nearly kindependent and using the k-integrated electron Green's\nfunction\nX Z d3 k\nGn (\u03b5 \u2212 \u03c9, k) =\n(2\u03c0)3\nn\nZ \u03b5c\n1\n=\nd\u03b5c\n= N (0)\ni(\u03b5\n\u2212\n\u03c9)\n\u2212 \u03b5c\n\u2212\u03b5c\n= \u2212i\u03c0N (0)sign(\u03b5 \u2212 \u03c9) + O(1/\u03b5c ), (5)\nwhere N (0) is the electron density of states (DOS) at\nthe Fermi level, and the high-energy cutoff \u03b5c is considered negligible small (of the order of Migdal's parameter). Then, the derivative of sign yields a delta\nfunction\nP and the \u03c9-integration is readily done yielding\n\u03bb = \u03bd 2N (0)g 2 /\u03c9\u03bd .\nIn the present case, which is not subject to Migdal's\ntheorem, this approach is not allowed since the renormalized electron Green's functions have a low energy structure at \u03b7c \u2248 20meV, the distance of the gap edges from\nFermi level, which causes additional terms in (5). Moreover, Eq. (3) represents a two-phonon vertex (four-leg\nvertex), and the corresponding contribution to the electron self-energy has two phonon propagators connecting\nthe two vertices and an additional \u03c9-integration in the\nself-energy, and without the situation\nwith the gaps one\nP\nwould again be left with \u03bb \u2248 \u03bd N (0)g 2 /\u03c9\u03bd , where only\ng is now the coupling strength (3) of the four-leg vertex,\nwhich in the present case is of the same order of magnitude as the usual g of an ordinary three leg vertex.

Non of the approximate assumptions leading to (4) and (5) can be maintained. So far\none could only speculate on the magnitude of the effects.\nNow, the nesting is considered in more detail. A closer\nlook on Fig. 5 reveals that a displacement uFe = 0.0645\u00c5,\nwhich does not much exceed the average displacement of\none phonon per mode, already removes two of the four\nFSs of the in-plane bands (Fe-3dxz and Fe-3dyz orbital\ncharacter) by opening a gap of about 75meV. Only an\nelectron FS of the shape of a cylindric shell around the\ntetragonal axis, quite isotropic perpendicular to it, survives (and the hole pocked around point Z of the band of\nFe-3dz2 orbital character). Just for illustration the effect\nof a (not quite realistic) two times larger displacement\nis also plotted on Fig. 5 for which the material becomes\na semi-metal with only two tiny FS pockets, an electron\nring and a hole pocket, both around Z. Even slightly\nlarger displacements would make it a true semiconductor. This is reflected in the behavior of the total DOS\nshown on Fig 6 (where the normalization is for the unit\ncell of the undistorted P4/nmm structure). One important point is that the nesting is only approximate and,\nmore importantly, that at a given energy the bands which\nwere originally electron or hole bands move in the same\ndirection. Since the band crossings are not exactly at\nFermi level and in e-p coupling theory the Fermi level\nhas to be kept fixed [15], the considered e-p coupling is\ntransmitted to all bands and is also transmitted to the\nband of Fe-3dz2 character. These findings (together with\nthe similar magnetic peculiarities [5]) are capable of explaining many of the unusual electronic properties of the\nundoped material.\nFinally, the effect of fluor doping for oxygen is studied\nby replacing one of eight oxygen atoms with a fluor atom\n\n\f4\nLaO0.875F0.125FeAs\n0.30\n\n0.20\n\nEnergy \u03b5n(k) [eV]\n\n0.10\n\n0.00\n\n\u22120.10\n\n\u22120.20\n\n\u22120.30\n\u0393\n\nX\n\nS\n\nY\n\n\u0393\n\nZ\n\nU\n\nR\n\nT\n\nFIG. 7: Bands of LaO0.875 F0.125 FeAs in the Pmm2\nzone.\n\nstates/eV/cell\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0\n0.1\nenergy in eV\n\n0.2\n\nLaO1\u2212x Fx FeAs is indeed very strong due to the Fe inplane breathing mode, and this cannot be treated in standard e-p theory of superconductivity. With respect to\nthis breathing mode, the material rather compares with\nMgB2 , although the details are quite different, and the\nmagnetic couplings already discussed in the literature\nmust also be taken seriously into account. In that respect, the material may have much in common with the\ncuprates. A principally similar but in detail quite different case is a breathing mode of the copper square lattice\nin connection with the approximate (\u03c0, \u03c0)-nesting [16].\nIt is intriguing hence, whether LaOFeAs could provide\nsome bridge between the other two cases, MgB2 and the\ncuprates. The undoped material appears to be a bad\nmetal with a great complexity of very strong couplings,\ne-p and magnetic. Doping (potentially both electron or\nhole) moves LaOFeAs away from this messy coupling\nsituation into a still strong coupled but good metallic\nregime. It is to be expected from former [5] and the\npresent analysis that LaOFeAs will be more symmetric\nwith respect to both electron and hole doping than the\ncuprates.\nHelpful discussion with Klaus Koepernik, StefanLudwig Drechsler, B. B\u00fcchner and in particular with M.\nEschrig are gratefully acknowledged. I.I. Mazin pointed\nout to me a substantial error in an earlier version of the\npaper.\n\n0.3\n\nFIG. 8: Total DOS of ordered LaO0.875 F0.125 FeAs\n(states per two formula units).\n\n\u2217\n\n[1]\n\nin an ordered way. This reduces the symmetry of the\nlattice further to the orthorhombic Pmm2 group with a\nfour times larger unit cell, square in plane, compared to\nthe P4/nmm structure. The corresponding bands (again\nfolded, into the Pmm2 zone, which however does not results in new shifts of the FSs which are already close\nenough to the central line \u0393 \u2212 Z) and total DOS are\nshown on Figs. 7 and 8. As can be seen by comparing\nFigs. 5 and 6 with Figs. 7 and 8, one fluor atom donates just one electron without changing the Fe derived\nt2g -bands (dxz , dyz ) in the vicinity of the Fermi level.\nTherefore, also no disorder effect of fluor doping is expected in the relevant electronic structure. Moreover, the\nFe-3dz2 derived bands, which shift a little bit due to the\nchange of layer charges, are now completely filled (one\nof them producing the DOS peak at about -150meV),\nand the corresponding hole pocket around Z has gone,\nleaving only the four slightly deformed cylindrical FSs,\ntwo larger electron cylinders around the \u0393 \u2212 Z axis and\ntwo smaller hole cylinders around the M \u2212 A axis of the\noriginal P4/NMM structure (cf. Fig. 2).\nIn summary, we have shown that the e-p coupling in\n\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n\nElectronic\naddress:\nh.eschrig@ifw-dresden.de;\nURL: http://www.ifw-dresden.de/institutes/itf/members/helmu\nY.
