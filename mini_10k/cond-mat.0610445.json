Our method relies on the axial assymetry of a double-well magnetic trap to selectively prepare the\nspin state in each cloud. We measure the energy dependence of s, p and d partial wave phase shifts in collisions\nup to 300 \u03bcK between 87 Rb atoms in the 5S1/2 , F = 1, mF = \u22121 and 5S1/2 , F = 2, mF = 1 states.\nPACS numbers: 34.50.-s, 03.65.Nk, 34.10.+x, 32.80.Pj\n\nCollisions in ultracold and degenerate quantum gases play\na key role in many of their interesting properties [1]. So\nfar, investigations with ultracold atoms have been mostly concerned with s-wave scattering processes, but now nonzero partial waves play a critical role in many investigations, (see, e.g.,\n[2]). A magnetic collider scheme for determining the contribution made by higher-order partial waves was recently implemented [3, 4]. In these experiments the atoms were in the\nsame spin state, limiting the collisions to those involving only\neven-order partial waves - a consequence of the particles being indistinguishable bosonic particles.\nIn the present work, we extend our collider method to distinguishable bosons for which the scattering is fundamentally\ndifferent since both odd and even angular momentum components are allowed. As in our original work [3], spin-polarized\n87\nRb atoms are loaded into a magnetic double-well potential which is then transformed to a single well to initiate a\ncollision. Here, however, one of the clouds is converted to\na different spin state prior to collision making the scattering\n\npatterns crucially different. We observe the interference of\ns, p and d partial waves for collisions between atoms in the\nF = 1, mF = \u22121 and F = 2, mF = 1 hyperfine ground\nstates. Despite the complexity of the three-wave interference,\nwe successfully determine the three partial wave phase shifts\nfor energies up to 300 \u03bcK as measured in units of the Boltzmann constant kB .\nThe angular dependence of the two-body scattering problem is described by the complex scattering amplitude f (\u03b8)\n[6]. Using the\nexpansion, this is expressed as\nP\u221epartial wave 2i\u03b7\n1\nl\n\u2212 1)Pl (cos \u03b8), where Pl is\nf (\u03b8) = 2ik\nl=0 (2l + 1)(e\nth\nthe l order Legendre polynomial and \u03b7l are the partial wave\nphase shifts which depend on the scattering potential and relative wave vector k of the colliding atom pair. For the range\nof energies we focus on here, only the first three partial waves\nl = 0, 1, 2 contribute [7]. In this case the differential crosssection d\u03c3/d\u03a9 = |f (\u03b8)|2 is given by\n\n25\n1\nd\u03c3\n= 2 {sin2 \u03b70 + 9 sin2 \u03b71 cos2 \u03b8 +\nsin2 \u03b72 (3 cos2 \u03b8 \u2212 1)2 + 6 sin \u03b70 sin \u03b71 cos(\u03b70 \u2212 \u03b71 ) cos \u03b8\nd\u03a9\nk\n4\n+ 5 sin \u03b70 sin \u03b72 cos(\u03b70 \u2212 \u03b72 )(3 cos2 \u03b8 \u2212 1) + 15 sin \u03b71 sin \u03b72 cos(\u03b71 \u2212 \u03b72 )(3 cos2 \u03b8 \u2212 1) cos \u03b8}.\n\nBecause of the orthogonality and completeness of the Legendre polynomials, a fit of an interference expression in the form\nEq. (1) to a measured angular distribution directly gives the\npartial wave phase shifts \u03b70 , \u03b71 and \u03b72 irrespective of knowledge about absolute quantities such as particle flux [4].\nOur experimental procedure is as follows. 87 Rb atoms in\nthe 5S1/2 F = 1, mF = \u22121 (\u2261 |1i) state are loaded into\na magnetic quadrupole-Ioffe-configuration (QUIC) trap [8]\nwith trap frequencies \u03c9z /2\u03c0 = 11 Hz axially and \u03c9\u03c1 /2\u03c0 =\n90 Hz radially. The details of loading the double-well trap and\ninitiating a collision are much the same as described in [3]. In\nsummary, after rf-induced evaporation of the atoms to a tem-\n\n(1)\n\nperature of approximately 2 \u03bcK we adiabatically transform\nthe potential to a double well by raising a potential barrier\nalong the axial dimension of the trap to split the cloud in half\n[9]. The clouds are then further evaporatively cooled to a temperature of typically a few hundred nano-Kelvin, just above\nthe Bose-Einstein condensation transition temperature. A collision between the clouds is initiated by rapidly transforming\nthe potential back to a single well. The collision energy is\nselected by adjusting the well spacing in the double-well trap.\nTo enable a collision between atoms in different spin states,\nwe apply a two-photon pulse consisting of a microwave (\u223c\n6.8 GHz) and an rf (\u223c 2 MHz) photon (depending on the Zee-\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: (color online) After a collision between two atomic clouds in\ndifferent spin states, pairs of diametrically-opposite scattered particles will be distributed over the expanding Newton sphere according\nto the differential cross-section. Using a light beam resonant with\nonly one of the states (depicted as red), an absorption image of the\ncontribution of this particular state to the scattering halo is obtained.\n\nman splitting) to transfer |1i state atoms to the 5S1/2 , F =\n2, mF = 1 (\u2261 |2i) state [10]. Due to the intrinsic axial asymmetry of the QUIC trap the clouds are situated at slightly different magnetic field values immediately after the double- to\nsingle-well trap transformation. This enables us to selectively\naddress and convert up to 90 % of the atoms in one of the\nclouds, while only 10 % of the atoms in the other cloud are\nconverted to the |2i state. To first order, the |1i and |2i states\nhave the same magnetic moment and experience the same confinement potential.\nTo selectively probe the scattered |2i state atoms we apply a 20 \u03bcs pulse of resonant light on the 5S1/2 , F = 2 \u2192\n5P3/2 , F \u2032 = 3 transition along a radial direction shortly after the end of the collision, and acquire an absorption image.\nThis leaves the |1i state atoms undetected. An illustration\nof this is shown in Fig. 1. Alternatively, we can simultaneously probe both the |1i and |2i state atoms by applying some\n5S1/2 , F = 1 \u2192 5P3/2 , F \u2032 = 2 light to pump all of the atoms\nto the F = 2 level shortly before the probing pulse.\nFigure 2 shows absorption images after a collision at\nE/kB = 135 \u03bcK between atomic clouds in the |1i and |2i\nstates. In Fig. 2(a) only atoms in the |2i state have been\nprobed, whereas in (b) atoms in both the |1i and |2i states\nare imaged. The distinct left-right asymmetry of the scattered atoms in (a) is the result of partial-wave interference\nbetween the odd (l = 1) p-wave and even s- and d-waves.\nThe scattering amplitude of the p-wave component changes\nsign at \u03b8 = \u00b1\u03c0/2 as can be seen in Fig. 3. For the collision\n\nFIG. 2: (color online) Scattering images for a collision at E/kB =\n135 \u03bcK, (a) probing only atoms in the F = 2 state and (b) probing\nboth the F = 1 and F = 2 states. The asymmetry in the scattering\npattern of (a) is due to p-wave scattering. The corresponding angular\nscattering probability is shown in (c) with a fit to Eq. (1) (solid line).\n\nenergy in this example, where the d-wave contribution is relatively small, the p-wave interferes constructively with s-wave\nfor angles |\u03b8| < \u03c0/2 and destructively for |\u03b8| > \u03c0/2 where \u03b8\nis defined with respect to the collision axis in the initial direction of travel (i.e., for the |2i state shown in Fig. 2, |\u03b8| < \u03c0/2\nis to the left of the image). Since \u03b8 is defined with the opposite sense for the |1i and |2i states, f (\u03b8) for the |1i state is\ncomplementary to that of |2i and imaging both states together\nresults in a symmetric scattering pattern [Fig. 2(b)].\nWe analyze the absorption images of the scattering patterns\nusing the method described in [11]. Briefly, we reconstruct\nthe 3D distribution of the scattered atoms using the inverse\nAbel transformation [12]. The Abel-inverted image is divided\ninto 30 angular bins which reflect the trajectories of scattered\natoms in the harmonic potential. The number of scattered\nparticles in each of the bins yields a measure of the angular\nscattering probability, which is proportional to the differential\ncross-section in Eq. (1). We fit Eq. (1) to this data to obtain\nthe partial wave phase shifts \u03b70 , \u03b71 and \u03b72 for the s, p, and\n\n\f3\n0.8\n0.6\n\n0.2\n\nl\n\n\u03b7 (\u03c0)\n\n0.4\n\n0\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.4\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nE/k\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\nB\n\nFIG. 4: (color online) The partial wave phase shifts for collisions\nbetween the |1i and |2i states.

The sign and magnitude of each\nl term in f (\u03b8) is plotted vertically for a spherical scattering shell\nwith a Gaussian profile in the radial direction. The relative scale of\neach is determined by \u03b7l . In contrast to s- and d-wave, the p-wave\ncontribution to f (\u03b8) is antisymmetric in \u03b8.\n\nd partial waves respectively. As emphasized by Buggle et al.\n[4], this is an interferometric method which does not rely on\nabsolute particle numbers and identifies only the amplitudes\nand relative signs of the phase shifts. The s-wave scattering\nlength is known to be positive (repulsive interaction) for the\nstates considered here so we choose the corresponding solution where \u03b70 < 0 for our energy range. The collision energy\n2\nE = mvrel\n/4 = ~k 2 /m is measured within a typical uncertainty of 5 \u03bcK by determining the relative velocity vrel from\na linear fit to the position of the clouds over approximately\n2 ms either side of collision. In Fig. 4 each phase shift value\nis the average of up to 10 measurements at the particular collision energy. The error bars on the data combine statistical\nuncertainty and errors associated with the fit to Eq. (1).\nA comparison of the measurements to theoretical predictions is shown in Fig. 4. These are standard coupled-channels\nnumerical calculations [13, 14, 15] for the collision of two\natoms in hyperfine states F, M and F \u2032 , M \u2032 in a low magnetic field B with relative (partial wave) angular momentum\nl and projection m. All channels {F M, F \u2032 M \u2032 , lm} coupled\nby terms in the molecular Hamiltonian are included. Only\nchannels with Mtot = M + M \u2032 + m can couple to one\nanother and because the collisions are from a single direction (defined by the vector connecting the two initial separated atomic clouds) we need only include the Mtot = 0\n\nchannels. The Hamiltonian contains the radial TR and rotational Trot kinetic energy terms, the electron-electron spinspin interaction \u03b12 Hss (where \u03b1 is the fine structure constant),\nthe electron-nuclear spin interaction terms \u03b12 Hhf that gives\nthe atomic hyperfine energies, and the strong chemical interactions described by the two adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer\npotential curves that correlate with two separated 2 S atoms.\nThese potential curves correspond to the electronic states of\n1 +\n\u03a3g and 3 \u03a3+\nu symmetry. There are 8 s-wave channels needed\nto describe Mtot = 0 s-wave collisions of |2i and |1i atoms\n(5 open and 3 closed). There are also 18 Mtot = 0 p-wave\ncollision channels (11 open and 7 closed), and 30 Mtot = 0 dwave channels (18 open and 12 closed). All of these channels\nare included in the basis set for each partial wave. If the channels are designated by the index j, so that P\nthe wavefunction\nfor atoms in the entrance channel i is \u03a8i = j |jifji (R)/R,\nthe coupled Schr\u00f6dinger equations, in a basis set defined\nby the separated atom quantum numbers, takes on the form\n\u0013\n\u0012\n~2 d2 fki\n~2 lk (lk + 1)\nfki (R)\n+\nE\n\u2212\nE\n\u2212\nk\n2\u03bc dR2\n2\u03bcR2\nX\nVkj (R)fji (R) = 0.\n(2)\n\u2212\nj\n\nHere Ek and lk are the respective Zeeman energy and relative\nangular momentum quantum number of the two colliding separated atoms for the magnetic field B, and the potential matrix\nelements Vkj define the interchannel coupling. These equations are solved numerically using standard algorithms [16].\nFor comparison with the data, the calculation uses a magnetic\nfield of 0.23 mT, and the scattering potentials are characterized by a dispersion coefficient C6 = 4703 au and triplet\nat = +98.96 a0 and singlet as = +90.1 a0 scattering lengths\nconsistent with [17] (1 au = Eh a60 , where Eh = 4.36 \u00d7 10\u221218\nJ and a0 = 0.0529 nm).\n\n\f4\nAs can be seen in Fig. 4, our experimental observations are\ndescribed well by the theoretical model. The dramatic change\nof the d-wave phase shift is a signature for the d-wave shape\nresonance known to occur for collisions between two 87 Rb\natoms [3, 4, 18]. We estimate the position of the resonance\nto be (235 \u00b1 50) \u03bcK with a width of approximately 120 \u03bcK\n(FWHM) from a Lorentzian fit to the data around the resonance. Calculated inelastic collision rate constants remain below 10\u221213 cm3 /s over the collision range of interest (compared to a maximum total elastic scattering cross-section of\n\u223c 1.6\u00d710\u221211 cm2 ), even when enhanced by the d-wave shape\nresonance. This is due to the exceptional case that both potentials have similar scattering phase shifts at low collision energies for threshold 87 Rb spin-exchange relaxation [19, 20, 21].\nCorrespondingly, we do not observe any atom loss from the\ntrap resulting from the collision.\nTwo effects are not included in our analysis: state impurities in the clouds and the possibility of multiple scattering.\nThe first of these is a difficult technical issue relating to our\nset-up and the second is of a more fundamental nature. With\nstate impurities in both clouds, the collision processes which\ncan occur are |1i + |2i, |2i + |2i, |1i + |1i, and |2i + |1i, with\nrelative amounts depending on the density of impurities. If\nthese effects were significant one would expect the presence of\ncollisions between the |1i and |2i states in the \"wrong\" direction to diminish the measured p-wave contribution, whereas\nscattering due to the |2i + |2i and |1i + |1i collision pro-\n\n[1] K.

As for the\nsecond issue, we observe only approximately one-third of the\ntotal number of atoms scattered after a collision near the resonance, indicating that the probability of a secondary collision\nis relatively small. A detailed theoretical analysis of multiple\nscattering is difficult outside the s-wave regime, and particularly near a d-wave shape resonance, since the energy and\ncentre-of-mass of a subsequent collision depend crucially on\nthe scattering angle after the first collision.\nIn conclusion, we have investigated the energy dependence\nof collisions between two 87 Rb clouds in different spin states.\nOur experimental observations agree well with predictions\nfrom a theoretical coupled-channels model. We note that the\ncollision between two such particles of different spins provides a mechanism for producing spin entanglement. The resulting pair correlation could potentially be observed as in recent experiments on dissociating molecules [22] and colliding\nBose-Einstein condensates [23]. Furthermore, the occurrence\nof a d-wave resonance and the resulting directionality of scattered particles may serve as a vehicle for the production of\npair correlated beams.\nThis work has been partially supported by the Marsden\nFund of the Royal Society of New Zealand (grant 02UOO080)\nand the U.
