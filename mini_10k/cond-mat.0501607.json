An expression for anomalous\nelectrical conductivity at low frequencies is found by using a generalized Langevin\nequation whose memory function accounts for the interactions between the carriers.\nNew mechanisms inducing a superdiffusive conductivity are discussed and experimental possibilities for observing that phenomenon in nanotubes and superlattices\nare presented.\n\nOne of the most fundamental quantities in transport theory is electrical conductivity whose understanding has permanently represented a challenge for\nmost of the last century. Discoveries of new aspects of this property have always been accompanied by technological innovation. Since finite conductivity\nis the consequence of the presence of one or more scattering mechanisms, most\nof the observed conductivity phenomena have always been obtained for diffusive or subdiffusive propagation of the charge carriers. The subdiffusive regime\noccurs in many different disordered materials such as ion conducting materials\nor glassy plastics. Measurements of the AC conductivity as a function of the\nfrequency reveal the existence of universal behavior of this quantity whose\norigin seems to be the only feature shared by those systems: the presence of\ndisorder [1].\nThe presence of correlated disorder may introduce drastic changes in the transport properties of a system by originating a superdiffusive behavior of the\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Science\n\n20 November 2018\n\n\fcharge carriers. This behavior can be observed e.g. in the quantum Heisenberg chain [2] where one can find the existence of both a superdiffusive regime\nemerging at weak correlations and a ballistic regime resulting from strong correlations. A similar result was obtained for a disordered chain [3]. It has been\nproved as well that the Anderson model with long-range correlated diagonal\ndisorder displays a finite phase of extended states in the middle of the band of\nallowed energies [4,5]. Moreover, the suppression of Anderson localization has\nrecently been confirmed experimentally in semiconductor super-lattices with\nintentional correlated disorder [6]. Quasi-ballistic and ballistic conduction at\nroom temperature has also recently been observed in carbon nanotubes [7].\nThe aim of this Letter is to propose a general scenario to describe the conduction mechanism in disordered materials valid for both correlated and uncorrelated disorder. The result can be expressed by a simple equation for the\nvariation of the conductivity as function of the frequency at low frequencies.\nWe show that subdiffusive conductivity increases with the frequency while\nsuperdiffusive conductivity decreases. The result is general and independent\nfrom a particular microscopic mechanism.\nIn the linear regime, transport properties can be determined through the\nknowledge of AC conductivity \u03c3(\u03c9). The first proposed model for AC conductivity, the Drude model, goes back more than a century. In spite of great\nprogress in the field, and the discovery of many forms of universal behavior\n[1] no general model accounting for the main characteristics of complex disordered systems has been set forth. Although a general relation for \u03c3(\u03c9) is\nnot available, some basic relations involving that quantity established long\nago still remain valid. The frequency-dependent diffusion coefficient D(\u03c9) is\nrelated to the conductivity through the expression\n\u03c3(\u03c9) =\n\nne2\nD(\u03c9) ,\nkB T\n\n(1)\n\nwhere, e is carrier charge, n the carrier density and T is temperature and kB\nis the Boltzmann constant. The above equation is a form of the fluctuationdissipation theorem. The frequency dependendent diffusion coefficient is defined as\nZ\nD(\u03c9) = Cv (t) exp(i\u03c9t) dt ,\n(2)\n\nwhere Cv (t) = hv(0)v(t)i is the velocity correlation function of the carriers\nand the brackets h* * * i indicate ensemble average. Our aim here is to describe\nthe interactions responsible for this behavior using a generalized Langevin\nequation (GLE) which makes the dependence more explicit and may display\nsuperdiffusion as well as normal diffusion and subdiffusion. Our starting point\nis that it does not matter which way Cv (t) is determined once established, the\ndiffusion and conductivity can be found. In general, complex materials present\na non-Ohmic behavior in the conductivity, and this effect is equivalent to the\n2\n\n\fpresence of memory, or a non-Markovian behavior [8,9,10,12].\nConductivity of complex materials presents in general a non-Ohmic behavior\nrelated to the presence of memory effects in the system. These effects have\nbeen successfully analyzed in many Non-Markovian systems by means of the\nGLE. In our case, this equation is given by [8,9,10,12]\nZ t\ndv(t)\nm\n= \u2212m \u0393(t \u2212 t\u2032 )v(t\u2032 ) dt\u2032 + F (t) ,\ndt\n0\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u0393(t) is the memory kernel and F (t) is a stochastic noise subject to the\nconditions hF (t)i = 0, hF (t)v(0)i = 0 and\nhF (t)F (0)i = mkB T \u0393(t) ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere m is the effective mass of the carriers. This last equation constitutes\nthe formulation of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.\nThe memory function \u0393(t) can be directly defined as\n\u0393(t) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03c1n (\u03c9) cos(\u03c9t) d\u03c9 ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03c1n (\u03c9) is the noise density of states or spectral density. Our aim here is\nto use Eq. (3) to analyze the existence of a superdiffusion regime in conduction\nby computing the correlation function and from there, the diffusion coefficient\nand the corresponding conductivity according to formulae (1).\nAn equation for Cv (t) can readily be obtained from Eq. (3) and the properties\nof the stochastic force as [10]\ndCv (t)\n=\u2212\ndt\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nt\n\n\u0393(t \u2212 t\u2032 )Cv (t\u2032 ) dt\u2032 .\n\n(6)\n\nwhich can be solved, by means of the Laplace transform yields\nC\u0303v (z) =\n\nCv (0)\n,\nz + \u0393\u0303(z)\n\n(7)\n\nwhere C\u0303v (z) and \u0393\u0303(z) are the correlation function and memory kernel Laplace\ntransforms. In view of Eq. (7), Eq. (1) can also be expressed as\nne2\n\u03c3e (z) =\nkB T\n\nCv (0)\nz + \u0393\u0303(z)\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(8)\n\nin Laplace (z) rather than Fourier space (\u03c9). This is our final form for the\nconductivity given in terms of the memory function and the corrlation at the\ninitial time. For systems where the equipartition theorem holds, one expect\n3\n\n\fthat Cv (0) = kB T /m, and the conductivity becomes temperature independent. This feature has never been observed for disordered materials; therefore,\nthe only explanation of this behavior is that equipartition is not fulfilled. It\nhas been shown that for glassy materials the fluctuation-dissipation theorem\nmay fail [11] since the system explores continuously metastable states never\nreaching true thermal equilibrium. The same expression of the theorem holds\nin some nonequilibrium situations if one replaces the temperature for an effective temperature [11,12]. The failure of the fluctuation-dissipation relation\nhas also been shown in systems undergoing ballistic motion [12]. In this situation the systems acquire an effective temperature Tef f 6= T . This effective\ntemperature is a signature of metastability and has been observed in many\ninstances [12].\nThe conductivity is in view of relation (1) influenced by the nature of the\ndiffusion process through the value of the memory function. Different diffusion\nregimes can be identified from the asymptotic behavior of the mean square\ndisplacement\nlim hx2 (t)i \u223c t\u03b1 .\n(9)\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nThis result follows from the GLE with the asymptotic expression for the memory function limz\u21920 \u0393\u0303(z) = \u03c4 \u03bd\u22121 z \u03bd , where \u03c4 is a relaxation time. The diffusion\nexponent \u03b1 is connected with \u03bd through \u03b1 = \u03bd + 1 [10]. Consequently, subdiffusion occurs for \u22121 < \u03bd < 0, normal diffusion for \u03bd = 0, and superdiffusion\nfor 0 < \u03bd < 1. For \u03bd \u2265 1 the fluctuation-dissipation theorem fails [12]. Our\nresult (8) explains the statement in Refs. [13,1] that at small frequencies \u03c3e (z)\nis an increasing function of z for subdiffusive propagation only. From Eq. (8)\nand the asymptotic value of the memory function given previously, one obtains\nd\u03c3e (z)\n1 + \u03bd(z\u03c4 )\u03bd\u22121\n\u223c\u2212\n.\ndz\n(z + \u0393\u0303(z))2\n\n(10)\n\nConsequently, for frequencies z < \u03c4 \u22121 , the derivative will be positive for subdiffusion and normal diffusion, \u22121 < \u03bd \u2264 0, and it will be negative for superdiffusion, 0 < \u03bd < 1. The value for the second derivative of the conductivity\nd2 \u03c3e (z)\n\u03bd(\u03bd \u2212 1)\n\u223c\u2212\n(11)\n2\nz\u21920 dz\n(\u03c4 z)2\nindicates that the curvature of the function \u03c3e (z) depends on \u03bd and therefore\npredicts a different behavior of the conductivity in the diffusion regimes discussed. The frequency-dependent conductivity can be inferred from Eq. (10)\nfor small z, yielding\nd ln(\u03c3e (z))\n\u223c \u2212\u03bd .\n(12)\nd ln(z)\nNote that the previously obtained relations hold regardless of the model used.\nBy simply measuring the real part of the AC conductivity \u03c3(\u03c9) as a function\nof the frequency \u03c9, we can obtain information about the diffusive process and\nlim\n\n4\n\n\fthe density of states, if the dimensionality of the system is known. If diffusion\ntakes place in a medium of dimensionality d, or in a fractal of fractal dimension\ndf , the diffusion coefficient scales as [14]\nD(\u03c9) \u221d \u03c9 \u03b1df \u22121 .\n\n(13)\n\nTheoretical studies have been performed in percolative clusters, as well as\nexperiments on material such as ionic conductive glass or amorphous semiconductors, see [1,15], for reviews. Those process have \u03bd < 0, and are subdiffusive. Recent theoretical [4,2,5], and experimental work [6,7], may support\nour assumption of superdiffusive AC conductivity.\nBetween normal diffusion and ballistic propagation, i.e., 0 < \u03bd < 1, we may\nhave many possibilities for superdiffusive mechanism, some of which have been\ndiscussed for nanotubes and super-lattices. The decrease of AC conductivity\nas a function of the frequency is the main point we propose for experimental\nobservation. Note that the possibility of motion beyond ballistic, \u03bd > 1, is\nvery rare. However, if they do exist, they violate the fluctuation-dissipation\ntheorem [12], and probably will not be described by linear response theory.\nNow we start to look for the possibility of superdiffusive or even ballistic\nmotion in some disorder-correlated system. Adame et al. [16] investigated Bloc\nOscillations in a one-dimensional lattice with long-range correlated diagonal\ndisorder. For their system, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the Wannier amplitude\nis\nd\u03c8n\ni\n= (\u03b5n \u2212 F )\u03c8n \u2212 \u03c8n+1 \u2212 \u03c8n\u22121 ,\n(14)\ndt\nwhere F is an external electrical field, and the stochastically fluctuating energies are\nN/2\n\n\u03b5n \u221d\n\nX\n\nk \u2212\u03b2/2 cos(\u03c0kn/N + \u03c6k ) ,\n\n(15)\n\nk=1\n\nand \u03c6k are random phases in the interval [0,2\u03c0]. For \u03b2 > 2, this model supports\ndelocalized states with a clear signature of Bloc oscillations. Recent studies\n[2] for the quantum Heisenberg chain with N sites, and exchange similar to\nthe energies above, present quite similar behavior. For example, the spin wave\nfunction localized at the origin at t = 0, will present a superdiffusive motion\nwith \u03b1 = 3/2 for the weak coupling, 0 < \u03b2 < 1. For strong coupling \u03b2 > 1,\nthe diffusion is ballistic. It has been proved as well that the Anderson model\nwith long-range correlated diagonal disorder displays a finite phase of extended\nstates in the middle of the band of allowed energies[4,5]. Ballistic diffusion have\nbeen proposed as well for ratchet devices using a thermal broadband noise,\nwith the elimination of the lower modes [17]. Moreover, the supression of\nAnderson localization was confirmed experimentally in semiconductor superlattices with intentional correlated disorder [6]. This behavior seems to be\nuniversal insofar as a correlated disorder as the one above can be defined. The\n5\n\n\fcorrelation disorder is of course, the main scattering mechanism which will be\nin charge of conduction. Some realistic simulations would be helpful to find\nthe best conditions to produce that material. Despite the difficulties involved,\nexperiments similar to those by Bellani et al. [6], may suggest that the stage\nis now set for superdiffusive conductors.\n\nReferences\n[1] J. C. Dyre and T. B. Schr\u00f8der, Rev. Mod. Phys., 72, 873 (2000).\n[2] F. A. B. F. de Moura, M. D.
