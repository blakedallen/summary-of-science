The question of the true nature of the\nobserved deviations remains open pending further theoretical and experimental\nstudy.\n\n1. Motivation\nThe PIBETA experiment[1] at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) is a comprehensive\nset of precision measurements of the rare decays of the pion and muon. The goals of\nthe experiment's first phase are:\n(a) To improve the experimental precision of the pion beta branching ratio (BR),\n\u03c0 + \u2192 \u03c0 0 e+ \u03bd (referred to as \u03c0e3 , or \u03c0\u03b2), from the present \u223c 4 % to \u223c 0.5 %.\n(b) To measure the branching ratio of the radiative pion decay \u03c0 \u2192 e\u03bd\u03b3 (\u03c0e2\u03b3 , or\nRPD), enabling a precise evaluation of the pion axial-vector form factor FA and\ntensor form factor FT , predicted to vanish in the Standard Model (SM).\n(c) An extensive measurement of the radiative muon decay rate, \u03bc \u2192 e\u03bd \u03bd\u0304\u03b3, with\nbroad phase space coverage, enabling a search for non- (V\u2212A) admixtures in\nthe weak Lagrangian.\nThe experiment's second phase calls for a precise measurement of the \u03c0 \u2192 e\u03bd\n(known as \u03c0e2 ) decay rate, used for BR normalization in the first phase. The current\n\u223c 0.35 % accuracy would be improved to under 0.2 %, in order to provide a precise\ntest of lepton universality, and, hence, of certain extensions to the Standard Model.\nIn this report we focus on part (b) above. Radiative pion decay offers unparalleled\naccess to information on the pion's structure. Given the unique role of the pion as the\nquasi-Goldstone boson of the strong interaction, the implications are far reaching.\n\n\fIn the Standard Model description [2] of the radiative pion decay \u03c0 + \u2192 e+ \u03bd\u03b3,\nwhere \u03b3 is a real or virtual photon (e+ e\u2212 pair), the decay amplitude M depends\non the vector V and axial vector A weak hadronic currents. Both currents give rise\nto structure-dependent terms SDV and SDA associated with virtual hadronic states,\nwhile the axial-vector current alone causes inner bremsstrahlung process IB from the\npion and positron.\nThe IB contribution to the decay probability can be calculated in a straightforward\nmanner using QED methods. The structure-dependent amplitude is parameterized\nby the vector form factor FV and the axial vector form factor FA that have to be\nextracted from experiments.\nThe statistics and overall accuracy of the present experimental data on the radiative pion decay [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] cannot rule out contributions from other allowed\nterms in the interaction lagrangian, namely the scalar S, pseudoscalar P, and tensor T\nadmixtures [9]. Nonzero values of any of these amplitudes would imply new physics\noutside the Standard Model. In particular, reports from the ISTRA collaboration\n[10, 11] have indicated a nonzero tensor term, FT = \u22120.0056 (17). A careful analysis\nby Herczeg of the existing beta decay data set could not rule out such a value of FT ,\npresumed to be due to leptoquarks [12]. A new intermediate chiral boson with an\nanomalous interaction with matter has been proposed by Chizhov in order to account\nfor the apparent non-(V\u2212A) behavior in RPD [13].\nMoreover, the ratio of FA /FV in \u03c0 \u2192 e\u03bd\u03b3 decay directly determines the chiral\nperturbation theory parameter sum (l9 + l10 ), or, equivalently, \u03b1E , the pion polarizability [14, 15, 16]. These quantities are of longstanding interest since they are among\nthe few unambiguous predictions of chiral symmetry and QCD at low energies. The\ncurrent status of these measurements is not satisfactory, as there is considerable scatter among the various experimental determinations of FA /FV , and the accepted PDG\naverage value has a 14 % uncertainty.\n\n2. Experimental method\nThe PIBETA apparatus is a large solid angle non-magnetic detector optimized\nfor detection of photons and electrons in the energy range of 5\u2013150 MeV with high\nefficiency, energy resolution and solid angle. The main sensitive components of the\napparatus, shown and labeled in Fig. 1, are:\n(a) beam definining plastic scintillator detectors: BC, a thin forward beam counter,\nAC1 and AC2 , cylindrical active collimators, AD, an active degrader, AT, a 9element segmented active target;\n(b) charged particle tracking and id: MWPC1 and MWPC2 , cylindrical chambers,\nand PV, a 20-bar segmented thin plastic scintillator hodoscope;\n(c) a 240-element segmented spherical pure-CsI shower calorimeter, subtending a\nsolid angle of \u223c 80 % of 4\u03c0.\n\n2\n\n\fpure\n\nCsI\n\nPV\n\u03c0+\n\nAC1\n\nMWPC1\n\nbeam\n\nBC\n\nAD\n\nAT\nMWPC2\n\nAC2\n\n10 cm\n\nFigure 1: (a) [above] Schematic cross\nsection of the PIBETA apparatus\nshowing the main components: beam\nentry counters (BC, AC1, AC2), active\ndegrader (AD), active target (AT),\nwire chambers (MWPCs) and support,\nplastic veto (PV) detectors and PMTs,\npure CsI calorimeter and PMTs. (b)\n[right] Axial (beam) view of the central\ndetector region showing the 9-element\nactive target and the charged particle\ntracking detectors.\n\nAT\nMWPC1\nMWPC2\n\n3\n\nPV\narray\n\n\fThe building and testing of the detector components were completed in 1998,\nfollowed by the assembly and commissioning of the full detector apparatus. Data\nacquisition with the PIBETA detector started in the second half of 1999, initially at\na reduced pion stopping rate, as planned. The experiment ran subsequently during\n2000 and 2001 at \u223c 1 MHz \u03c0 + stopping rate.\nA full complement of twelve fast analog triggers comprising all relevant logic combinations of one- or two-arm, low- or high calorimeter threshold , prompt and delayed\n(with respect to \u03c0 + stop time), as well as a random and a three-arm trigger, were\nimplemented in order to obtain maximally comprehensive and unbiased data samples.\n\n3. Results and analysis\nWe have used both one- and two-arm triggers to collect a clean set of > 43 k\n\u03c0 + \u2192 e+ \u03bd\u03b3 decays. The PIBETA experiment has good sensitivity in three distinct\nregions in the RPD phase space\nA: with e+ and \u03b3 emitted into opposite hemispheres, each with energy exceeding\nthat of the Michel edge (EM \u2243 52 MeV), recorded in a two-arm trigger,\nB: with an energetic photon (E\u03b3 > EM ), and Ee+ > 20 MeV, recorded in the\none-arm trigger,\nC: with an energetic positron (Ee+ > EM ), and E\u03b3 > 20 MeV, recorded in the\none-arm trigger.\nThe quality of our \u03c0 + \u2192 e+ \u03bd\u03b3 data is illustrated in Fig. 2. The left panel of the figure\nshows the timing difference between the detected e+ 's and \u03b3's for the three kinematic\nregions of the decay, as noted. Plotted in the right panel of Fig. 2 is the kinematic\nvariable Ee+ + E\u03b3 + |~pe + p~\u03b3 | (\"invariant pion mass\"), with the out-of-time events\nsubtracted; it is in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating\nthat our RPD signal is clean in all three regions.\nTogether, the three regions overconstrain the Standard Model parameters describing the decay, and thus allow us to examine possible new information about the pion's\nhadronic structure, or non-(V\u2212A) interactions. Details of the full data analysis require a longer presentation than is possible here, so we only give a brief discussion.\nSimultaneous as well as separate fits of our data in regions A, B and C confirm\nthe theoretically expected ratio of FA /FV \u2243 0.5. In particular, we find in a Standard\nModel fit with FA set free, and FV = 0.0259(5) fixed by the CVC hypothesis\n\u03b3=\n\nFA\n= 0.429 \u00b1 0.014\nFV\n\nor\n\nFA = 0.01111(36) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhich represents a fourfold improvement in accuracy over the current world average.\nThis result provides the most accurate experimental determination to date of the pion\npolarizability, \u03b1E , and of the \u03c7P T parameter sum (l9 + l10 ).\n4\n\n\fFigure 2: e-\u03b3 timing difference for \u03c0 \u2192 e\u03bd\u03b3 decay events in regions A, B, and C\n(left panels, top to bottom, respectively). The right panels plot the reconstructed\ninvariant \u03c0 + mass variable, for our radiative pion decay event data (dots) in regions\nA, B, and C, and simulation (histogram).\n\n5\n\n\fHowever, our simultaneous fits demonstrate a statistically significant deficit of\nRPD yield in region B, compared to V\u2212A calculations with the above values of FV\nand FA . In order to account for this deficit we need to introduce a tensor term\ndestructively interfering with the IB amplitude, which has led to the result\nFT = \u22120.0016 (3) .\n\n(2)\n\nThe effect of the tensor term is best illustrated in Fig. 3. showing the measured\ndistribution of \u03bb, a relevant kinematic variable based on Ee and \u03b8e\u03b3 , in region B. The\nsolid curve, including a negative tensor form factor, is clearly preferred by the data,\nwhich is reflected in much reduced value of \u03c72 .\n\nFigure 3: Measured spectrum of \u03bb = (2Ee /m\u03c0 ) sin2 (\u03b8e\u03b3 /2) in RPD for the kinematic\nregion B, with limits noted in the figure. Dashed curve: fit with the pion form factor\nFV = 0.0259 fixed by the CVC hypothesis, FT = 0, and FA free. Solid curve: FV and\nFA = 0.01111 from the first fit, this time with FT released to vary freely, resulting in\nFT = \u22120.0016 (3). Error bars on the points at bottom of graph reflect the expected\nuncertainties in the proposed dedicated measurement of the RPD.\nUnfortunately, region B is characterized by the lowest signal/accidental background (S/B) ratio of the three regions, cf. Fig. 2, and, consequently the data in\nregion B are of lower quality than in region C, and especially region A. This is a\nconsequence of the priority having been given to \u03c0\u03b2 data in PIBETA's first phase\nwhich favored higher rate running. Even with this compromise our data unambiguously deviate from the SM (V\u2212A) behavior by over 5\u03c3. At the same time, though,\nthey rule out the large ISTRA value of (\u2212FT ) \u2243 0.006 \u2212 0.012 [10, 11].\nGiven the unique sensitivity of region B to the putative tensor interaction, the\nlongstanding interest in this open question, and the less than optimal quality of our\n6\n\n\fdata in region B, we plan to revisit RPD with a dedicated run optimized for regions\nB and C. The breakdown of the counting statistics in the first-phase RPD data set\nis NA : (NB + NC ) = 31 k : 12 k. Running for three months with a reduced pion\nstopping rate and suitably modified trigger, we can collect up to 20 k clean events\nwith S/B > 40 : 1 in regions B and C. The expected error limits for these planned\ndata in region B are shown in Fig. 3 on the line of data points at the bottom of the\nplot. In the process we will also improve our precision on the FA /FV ratio.\nWe note in closing that the discrepancy from the SM behavior observed in our\nRPD data must also be reexamined from the theoretical side.
