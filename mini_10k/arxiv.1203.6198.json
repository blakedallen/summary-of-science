We show that torsion group schemes of abelian varieties in positive characteristic occur as iterative differential Galois groups of extensions\nof iterative differential fields. The main part is to find computable criteria\nwhen higher derivations are iterative derivations, and furthermore when an\niterative derivation on the function field of an abelian variety is compatible\nwith the addition map. For an explicit example, we give a construction of\n(a family of) such iterative derivations on the function field of an elliptic\ncurve in characteristic two.\n\n1. Introduction\nFor transcendental field extensions L/F the group of automorphisms of L over\nF is huge and one is far from obtaining a Galois correspondence. By considering\nderivations on the fields (resp. iterative derivations in positive characteristic),\none obtains a natural subgroup of all automorphisms, namely those automorphisms which commute with the (iterative) derivation. These automorphisms\nare called (iterative) differential automorphisms. In special cases, the group\nof (iterative) differential automorphisms form a linear algebraic group and one\nhas a Galois correspondence between Zariski-closed subgroups and intermediate differential fields. In Picard-Vessiot theory one considers such cases. Here\nthe extension field L is obtained as the solution field of a linear (iterative) differential equation over the differential field F , quite analogous to the classical\nGalois theory where the extension fields are obtained as solution fields of algebraic equations. By considering the automorphism group not as a group, but\nas a group scheme, one can deal with nonnormal and even inseparable iterative\ndifferential extensions (see [1] and [2], Sect.10). Moreover, this also applies to\nfinite ID-extensions, and one can even obtain an infinitesimal group scheme as\nID-Galois group scheme (cf. [3]).\nIn this article, we will consider special finite group schemes, namely the torsion group schemes of an abelian variety. More precisely, we give iterative\ndifferential field extensions having as ID-Galois group scheme the torsion group\nscheme of an abelian variety. Throughout the article we will stick to positive\ncharacteristic.\nThe rough idea for getting the n-torsion scheme A[n] of an abelian variety A\nover a perfect field C as ID-Galois group scheme is the following. Starting\nwith the abelian variety A over C we consider the function field L of AC(t) (i.e.\nof A after base change to C(t)) as an extension of the rational function field\nDate: September 13, 2018.\nKey words and phrases.

The field C(t) comes with a standard iterative derivation with respect to\n\u2202\n), and this iterative derivation\nt (the characteristic p-analog of the derivation \u2202t\nis then extended to an iterative derivation on L. By taking care that this\nextension fulfills the appropriate conditions, one guarantees that the torsion\ngroup scheme A[n] indeed acts on L by ID-automorphisms. Hence by PicardVessiot theory, one obtains A[n] as the iterative differential Galois group of L\nover LA[n] , the fixed field under A[n]. To be more precise, one should say that\nthe group scheme acts by functorial automorphisms, i.e. D-rational points act\nas ID-automorphisms on the total quotient ring Quot(L \u2297C D).\nThe article is structured as follows. In Section 2, we give the basic notation\nand some basic properties which will be used in the calculations later on. Furthermore, we give a short summary of the Picard-Vessiot theory used in this\narticle. The theoretical considerations for obtaining the torsion group scheme\nof an abelian scheme as ID-Galois group are given in Sections 3 and 4. The\nmain theorems are Theorem 3.2 giving a necessary and sufficient condition for\nthe iterative derivation on the function field of an abelian variety to \"commute\"\nwith the addition map, as well as Theorem 4.1 stating that the torsion group\nschemes are the ID-Galois group schemes over an appropriate subfield when the\niterative derivation satisfies the previous conditions.\nIn the last sections we do explicite calculations. While Section 5 deals with\nthe extension of an iterative derivation to an overfield in general, Section 6 is\ndedicated to the example of an elliptic curve in characteristic 2. In this case, we\ngive recursive formulas for constructing an iterative derivation on the function\nfield which satisfies the previously stated conditions (cf. Theorem 6.3).\n2. Basic notation\nAll rings are assumed to be commutative with unit.\nWe will use the following notation (see also [3]). A higher derivation (HD\nfor short) on a ring R is a homomorphism of rings \u03b8 : R \u2192 R[[T ]], such that\n\u03b8(r)|T =0 = r for all r \u2208 R. If there is need to emphasis the extra variable T or\nif we use another name for the variable, we add a subscript to \u03b8, i.e. denote the\nhigher derivation by \u03b8T (resp. \u03b8U if the variable is named U ).\nA higher derivation is called\nan iterative derivation (ID for short) if for all\ni+j \u0001 (i+j)\n(i)\n(j)\ni, j \u2265 0, \u03b8 \u25e6 \u03b8 = i \u03b8\n, where the maps \u03b8 (i) : R \u2192 R are defined by\nP\u221e (i)\ni\n\u03b8(r) =: i=0 \u03b8 (r)T . The pair (R, \u03b8) is then called an HD-ring (resp. IDring) and CR := {r \u2208 R | \u03b8(r) = r} is called the ring of constants of (R, \u03b8).\nAn HD/ID-ring which is a field is called an HD/ID-field. Higher derivations\nand iterative derivations are extended to localisations by \u03b8( rs ) := \u03b8(r)\u03b8(s)\u22121\nand to tensor products by\nX\n\u03b8 (k) (r \u2297 s) =\n\u03b8 (i) (r) \u2297 \u03b8 (j)(s)\ni+j=k\n\nfor all k \u2265 0.\nGiven a homomorphism of rings f : R \u2192 S, we often consider the T -linear\nextension of f to a homomorphism R[[T ]] \u2192 S[[T ]] of the power series rings.\nThis map will be denoted by f [[T ]]. Given two HD-rings (R, \u03b8) and (S, \u03b8\u0303).\nA homomorphism of rings f : R \u2192 S is called an HD-homomorphism\n\n\fTORSION GROUP SCHEMES\n\n3\n\n(resp. ID-homomorphism if R and S are ID-rings) if \u03b8\u0303 \u25e6 f = f [[T ]] \u25e6 \u03b8.\nAs a special case of a homomorphism f [[T ]], we have the homomorphism\n\u03b8U [[T ]] : R[[T ]] \u2192 R[[T, U ]] induced by the higher derivation \u03b8U : R \u2192\nR[[U ]] on R. A short calculation shows (cf. [4]) that a higher derivation \u03b8\non R is an iterative derivation if and only if the following diagram commutes\nR\n\n\u03b8U\n\n/ R[[U ]]\n\n\u03b8T\n\nU 7\u2192U +T\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n\n\u03b8U [[T ]]\n/ R[[U, T ]],\nR[[T ]]\nor in other terms \u03b8U [[T ]] \u25e6 \u03b8T = \u03b8T +U .\n\nExample 1. (cf. [2])\n(1) For any field C and F := C(t), the homomorphism of C-algebras \u03b8 :\nF \u2192 F [[T ]] given by \u03b8(t) := t + T is an iterative derivation on F\nwith field of constants C. This iterative derivation will be called the\niterative derivation with respect to t.\n(2) For any ring R, there is the trivial iterative derivation on R given by\n\u03b80 : R \u2192 R[[T ]], r 7\u2192 r * T 0 . Obviously, the ring of constants of (R, \u03b80 )\nis R itself.\n(3) If (F, \u03b8) is an HD-field and L \u2265 F is a finite separable field extension,\nthen \u03b8 can be uniquely extended to a higher derivation on L. If the\nhigher derivation \u03b8 is an iterative derivation, then the extension to L is\nalso an iterative derivation.\n(4) Let (F, \u03b8) be an HD-field, L/F a finitely generated separable field extension and x1 , . . . , xk a separating transcendence basis of L over F (i.e.\nF (x1 , . . . , xk )/F is purely transcendental and L/F (x1 , . . . , xk ) is finite\nseparable). Using the previous example, it is easy to see that any choice\nof elements \u03bei,n \u2208 L (i = 1, . . . , k and n \u2265 1) defines a unique\nhigher\nP\nn\nderivation \u03b8L on L extending \u03b8 and satisfying \u03b8L (xi ) = xi + \u221e\nn=1 \u03bei,n T\nfor all i = 1, . . . , k.\nWe now summarize some well known formulas for higher derivations and iterative derivations in characteristic p > 0 which will be used later on:\nLemma 2.1.\n\u0001p\n(1) \u03b8 (j)(xp ) = 0 if p does not divide j and \u03b8 (j) (xp ) = \u03b8 (j/p)(x) if p\ndivides j.\n(2) If m = m0 + m1 p + * * * + mk pk and n = n0 + n1 p + * * * + nk pk where\nmi , ni \u2208 {0, . . . , p \u2212 1} then\n\u0012 \u0013 \u0012 \u0013 \u0012 \u0013 \u0012 \u0013\nm\nmk\nm1\nm0\n\u2261\n*\n***\nmod p.\nn\nn0\nn1\nnk\n\n(3) If \u03b8 is iterative, then (\u03b8 (j) )p = 0 for all j.\n(4) Let m = m0 + m1 p + * * * + mk pk where mi \u2208 {0, . . . , p \u2212 1}.

(1) The set under consideration is just the equalizer of the ring homomorphisms \u03b8U [[T ]] \u25e6 \u03b8T : L \u2192 L[[T, U ]/(U k+1\u2212j T j | 0 \u2264 j \u2264 k + 1) and \u03b8T +U .\nHence, it is a subfield of L.\n\u0001\n(2) As k, m < pl and k + m \u2265 pl , the binomial coefficient k+m\nequals 0\nk\nin characteristic p. Hence, the right hand side of the equation equals 0. For\nproving that the left hand side equals zero, it is sufficient to consider the case\nwhere k = pj for some j < l, as any \u03b8 (k) is a composition of those up to a\nnon-zero constant. Let m\u2032 := m + pj \u2212 pl . By assumption on m and pj , we\nhave 0 \u2264 m\u2032 < pj .

We now recall some definitions from Picard-Vessiot\ntheory. (F, \u03b8) denotes some ID-field with constants C.\nP\nk\nDefinition 2.3. Let A = \u221e\nk T \u2208 GLn (F [[T ]]) be a matrix with A0 = 1n\nk=0 A\n\u0001\nP\nk+l\nand for all k, l \u2208 N, l Ak+l = i+j=l \u03b8 (i) (Ak ) * Aj . An equation\n\u03b8(y) = Ay,\n\nwhere y is a vector of indeterminants, is called an iterative differential equation (IDE).\nRemark 2.4. The \u0001condition on the Ak is equivalent to the condition that\n(k+l) (Y ) holds for a matrix Y = (Y )\n\u03b8 (k) (\u03b8 (l) (Yij )) = k+l\nij\nij 1\u2264i,j\u2264n \u2208 GLn (E)\nk \u03b8\nsatisfying \u03b8(Y ) = AY , where E is some ID-extension of F . (Such a Y is called\na fundamental solution matrix) . The condition A0 = 1n is equivalent to\n\u03b8 (0) (Yij ) = Yij , and already implies that the matrix A is invertible.\nDefinition 2.5. An ID-ring (R, \u03b8R ) \u2265 (F, \u03b8) is called a Picard-Vessiot ring\n(PV-ring) for the IDE \u03b8(y) = Ay, if the following hold:\n(1) R is an ID-simple ring, i.e. has no nontrivial \u03b8R -stable ideals.\n(2) There is a fundamental solution matrix Y \u2208 GLn (R), i. e., an invertible\nmatrix satisfying \u03b8(Y ) = AY .\n(3) As an F -algebra, R is generated by the coefficients of Y and by det(Y )\u22121 .\n(4) CR = CF = C.\nThe quotient field E = Quot(R) (which exists, since such a PV-ring is always\nan integral domain) is called a Picard-Vessiot field (PV-field) for the IDE\n\u03b8(y) = Ay.1\n1The PV-rings and PV-fields defined here were called pseudo Picard-Vessiot rings (resp.\npseudo Picard-Vessiot fields) in [2] and [3]. This definition, however, is the most natural\ngeneralisation of PV-rings and PV-fields to non algebraically closed fields of constants.\n\n\f6\n\nANDREAS MAURISCHAT\n\nFor a PV-ring R/F one defines the functor\nAutID (R/F ) : (Algebras/C) \u2192 (Groups), D 7\u2192 AutID (R \u2297C D/F \u2297C D)\nwhere D is equipped with the trivial iterative derivation. In [2], Sect. 10, it\nis shown that this functor is representable by a C-algebra of finite type, and\nhence, is an affine group scheme of finite type over C. This group scheme is\ncalled the (iterative differential) Galois group scheme of the extension R over\nF \u2013 denoted by Gal(R/F ) \u2013, or also, the Galois group scheme of the extension\nE over F , Gal(E/F ), where E = Quot(R) is the corresponding PV-field.\nFurthermore, Spec(R) is a (Gal(R/F ) \u00d7C F )-torsor and the corresponding isomorphism of rings\n(1)\n\n\u03b3 : R \u2297F R \u2192 R \u2297C C[Gal(R/F )]\n\nis an R-linear ID-isomorphism. Again, the ring of regular functions C[Gal(R/F )]\nis equipped with the trivial iterative derivation.\nOn the other hand, if (R, \u03b8R ) is an ID-simple ID-ring extending (F, \u03b8) with\nthe same constants, and if there is an R-linear ID-isomorphism \u03b3 : R \u2297F R \u2192\nR\u2297C C[G] for some affine group scheme G \u2264 GLn,C corresponding to an action of\nG, then R/F is indeed a Picard-Vessiot ring for some IDE (cf. [2], Prop. 10.12).\nFor later purposes, also keep in mind that for a finite Picard-Vessiot extension\nR/F , the PV-ring R already is a field. Hence, in that case the quotient field E\ncoincides with the PV-ring R.\n3. Iterative derivations compatible with addition\nLet C be a field of positive characteristic p, k = C(t) the rational function\nfield with iterative derivation by t, and let A/C be a connected abelian scheme\nover C. The addition map on A will be denoted by \u2295 : A \u00d7 A \u2192 A (and the\nsubtraction by \u2296).\nLet KA denote the function field of A. Let (L, \u03b8) be the field L = KA (t) with\nsome higher derivation \u03b8 extending the one on k = C(t), and let D be the field\nKA equipped with the trivial higher derivation. The higher derivations of L and\nD are extended to a higher derivation (also denoted by \u03b8) on LD := L * D :=\nQuot(L \u2297C D).\nThe map \u2295 induces a homomorphism of fields KA \u2192 KA\u00d7A = KA * KA and\nalso a homomorphism L \u2192 L * D by t-linear extension. Extending again Dlinearly, we obtain an isomorphism \u03c1 : LD \u2192 LD. This isomorphism fixes\nexactly the elements in D(t) \u2286 LD, i.e. D(t) = {x \u2208 LD | \u03c1(x) = x}. Actually\n\u03c1 is nothing else than the homomorphism on the generic fibers corresponding\nto AC(t) \u00d7 A \u2192 AC(t) \u00d7 A, (p1 , p2 ) 7\u2192 (p1 \u2295 p2 , p2 ).\nLemma 3.1. With notation as above, let \u03b7L \u2208 A(L) be the generic point,\nand let \u03b8\u2217 : A(L) \u2192 A(L[[T ]]) be the map induced by \u03b8. Then \u03c1 is an HDhomomorphism if and only if \u03b7L \u2296 \u03b8\u2217 (\u03b7L ) \u2208 A(C(t)[[T ]]).\nProof. Since in any case \u03b7L \u2296 \u03b8\u2217 (\u03b7L ) \u2208 A(L[[T ]]), the condition is equivalent to\nsaying that \u03b7L \u2296 \u03b8\u2217 (\u03b7L ) \u2208 A(D(t)[[T ]]) \u2286 A(LD[[T ]]).\nLet \u03b7D denote the generic point of A in A(D), and \u03c1\u2217 : A(LD) \u2192 A(LD)\nthe map induced by \u03c1. Then by construction, one has \u03c1\u2217 (\u03b7L ) = \u03b7L \u2295 \u03b7D , and\ntherefore, \u03b8\u2217 (\u03c1\u2217 (\u03b7L )) = \u03b8\u2217 (\u03b7L \u2295 \u03b7D ) = \u03b8\u2217 (\u03b7L ) \u2295 \u03b7D , since \u03b8 acts trivially on D.\n\n\fTORSION GROUP SCHEMES\n\n7\n\nHence:\n\u03b7L \u2296 \u03b8\u2217 (\u03b7L ) \u2208 A(D(t)[[T ]]) \u21d4\n\u21d4\n\u21d4\n\u21d4\n\u21d4\n\n(\u03c1[[T ]])\u2217 (\u03b7L \u2296 \u03b8\u2217 (\u03b7L )) = \u03b7L \u2296 \u03b8\u2217 (\u03b7L )\n\u03c1\u2217 (\u03b7L ) \u2296 (\u03c1[[T ]])\u2217 (\u03b8\u2217 (\u03b7L )) = \u03b7L \u2296 \u03b8\u2217 (\u03b7L )\n(\u03b7L \u2295 \u03b7D ) \u2296 (\u03c1[[T ]])\u2217 (\u03b8\u2217 (\u03b7L )) = \u03b7L \u2296 \u03b8\u2217 (\u03b7L )\n\u03b8\u2217 (\u03b7L ) \u2295 \u03b7D = (\u03c1[[T ]])\u2217 (\u03b8\u2217 (\u03b7L ))\n\u03b8\u2217 (\u03c1\u2217 (\u03b7L )) = (\u03c1[[T ]])\u2217 (\u03b8\u2217 (\u03b7L ))\n\nSince \u03b7L is the generic point of A, the last equality is equivalent to \u03b8 \u25e6 \u03c1 =\n\u03c1[[T ]] \u25e6 \u03b8, i.e. to the condition that \u03c1 is an HD-homomorphism.\n\u0003\nTheorem 3.2. We use notation as above. Let C(t)[[T, U ]] be the power series ring over C(t) in two variables T and U and let R denote the subring of\nC(t)[[T, U ]] of those power series P (t, T, U ) such that P (t+U, T, 0) = P (t, T, U ).\nThen \u03b8 is an iterative derivation and \u03c1 is an ID-homomorphism if and only if\n\u03b8U,\u2217 (\u03b7L ) \u2296 \u03b8T +U,\u2217 (\u03b7L ) \u2208 A(R).\nAs already mentioned earlier, \u03b8U : LD \u2192 LD[[U ]] and \u03b8T +U : LD \u2192 LD[[T, U ]]\ndenote the maps \u03b8 with T replaced by U and T + U , respectively, and \u03b8U,\u2217 :\nA(LD) \u2192 A(LD[[U ]]) as well as \u03b8T +U,\u2217 : A(LD) \u2192 A(LD[[T, U ]]) the induced\nmaps.\nProof. Let us first remark that R is nothing else than the image of C(t)[[T ]]\nunder the homomorphism \u03b8U [[T ]], since the map \u03b8U [[T ]] on C(t)[[T ]] is just\nreplacing t by t + U .\nNow assume that \u03b8 is an iterative derivation such that \u03c1 is an ID-homomorphism. Since \u03b8 is an iterative derivation, one has \u03b8U +T = \u03b8U [[T ]] \u25e6 \u03b8T ,\nand therefore \u03b8U,\u2217 (\u03b7L ) \u2296 \u03b8T +U,\u2217 (\u03b7L ) = (\u03b8U [[T ]])\u2217 (\u03b7L \u2296 \u03b8T,\u2217 (\u03b7L )). Since \u03c1 is an\nID-homomorphism, one has \u03b7L \u2296\u03b8T,\u2217 (\u03b7L ) \u2208 A(C(t)[[T ]]) by the previous lemma.\nHence, we obtain (\u03b8U [[T ]])\u2217 (\u03b7L \u2296 \u03b8T,\u2217 (\u03b7L )) \u2208 A(C(t)[[T, U ]]). By the characterisation of R above, the point (\u03b8U [[T ]])\u2217 (\u03b7L \u2296 \u03b8T,\u2217 (\u03b7L )) is indeed R-valued.\nFor the converse, let \u03b8U,\u2217 (\u03b7L ) \u2296 \u03b8T +U,\u2217 (\u03b7L ) \u2208 A(R). Mapping U to 0 leads to\n\u03b7L \u2296 \u03b8T,\u2217 (\u03b7L ) \u2208 A(C(t)[[T ]]), hence \u03c1 is an HD-homomorphism by the previous\nlemma. As before, the condition that the expression is in A(R) implies that we\nobtain the same element when mapping U 7\u2192 0 and applying (\u03b8U [[T ]])\u2217 . Hence\n\u03b8U,\u2217 (\u03b7L ) \u2296 \u03b8T +U,\u2217 (\u03b7L ) = (\u03b8U [[T ]])\u2217 (\u03b80,\u2217 (\u03b7L ) \u2296 \u03b8T +0,\u2217 (\u03b7L ))\n= \u03b8U,\u2217 (\u03b7L ) \u2296 (\u03b8U [[T ]])\u2217 (\u03b8T,\u2217 (\u03b7L ))\nThis means \u03b8T +U,\u2217 (\u03b7L ) = (\u03b8U [[T ]])\u2217 (\u03b8T,\u2217 (\u03b7L )). Since \u03b7L is the generic point,\nthis implies \u03b8T +U = \u03b8U [[T ]] \u25e6 \u03b8T , and therefore \u03b8 is iterative.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.3. So far, we didn't use commutativity of \u2295. Hence, all the statements made so far are also valid for non-commutative connected group schemes\ninstead of abelian schemes.\n4. Torsion schemes as Galois group schemes\nWe use the notation of the previous section. In particular, A/C is an abelian\nscheme and L is the function field of AC(t) equipped with a higher derivation \u03b8\nextending the iterative derivation with respect to t on C(t).\n\n\f8\n\nANDREAS MAURISCHAT\n\nTheorem 4.1. Let \u03b8 be an iterative derivation on L such that \u03c1 is an IDhomomorphism. Also assume that the constants of (L, \u03b8) are C. For n \u2208 N, let\n[n] : A \u2192 A denote multiplication by n, A[n] = Ker([n]) the n-torsion scheme,\nand [n]# : L \u2192 L the corresponding map on the function fields of AC(t) . Then\n(1) the subfield [n]# (L) \u2286 L is an ID-subfield of L,\n(2) the extension L/[n]# (L) is a PV-extension and the iterative differential\nGalois group scheme is given as\nGal(L/[n]# (L)) \u223c\n= A[n]\nas affine group schemes over C.\nProof. The addition\n\u0002\n\u0003 A \u00d7 A[n] \u2192 A induces a homomorphism \u03c1\u0304 : OA (U ) \u2192\nOA\n(U\n)\n\u2297\nC\nA[n]\nfor an appropriate (affine) open subset U \u2286 A, where\nC\n\u0002\n\u0003\nC A[n] denotes the ring of regular functions on the affine scheme A[n]. The\nsubring [n]# (OA (U )) is then the equalizer of \u03c1\u0304 and id \u2297 1.\n\u0002\n\u0003\nFurthermore, \u03c1\u0304 can be extended to a homomorphism \u03c1\u0304 : L \u2192 L \u2297C C A[n]\nby \u03c1\u0304(t) = t \u2297 1 and by localisation. This map \u03c1\u0304 is actually a specialisation of\nthe map \u03c1 : L \u2192 LD. By assumption\n\u0002 \u03c1 is\n\u0003 an ID-homomorphism and therefore\n\u03c1\u0304 is an ID-homomorphism when C A[n] is equipped with the trivial iterative\nderivation.\nThis shows that the equalizer [n]# (L) \u2286 L is an ID-subfield of L.\nThe L-linear extension of \u03c1\u0304 leads to an ID-homomorphism \u03c1\u0304L : L \u2297[n]#(L) L \u2192\n\u0002\n\u0003\nL \u2297C C A[n] which is a monomorphism, since [n]# (L) is the equalizer of \u03c1\u0304 and\nid \u2297 1.\n\u0002\n\u0003\nAs the degree of the extension L/[n]# (L) equals the dimension dimC (C A[n] ),\nthis monomorphism is indeed an ID-isomorphism.\nTherefore, the second claim follows by [2], Prop. 10.12. (Here we use that the\nconstants of L are indeed C.)\n\u0003\n5. Extension of iterative derivations\nIn this section we develop criteria for a higher derivation to be iterative. This\nwill be used in the last section. We will assume that C is a field of characteristic\np > 0, and (F, \u03b8) is an ID-field containing C(t) such that \u03b8|C(t) is the iterative\nderivation with respect to t (compare Ex. 1(1)).\nTheorem 5.1.

On the other hand, given the conditions in (2), any\nn\n\u03b8 (i) with i < pl0 +1 can be written as a composition of several \u03b8 (p ) as in\nLemma 2.1(4). Then it is not hard to check that \u03b8 (i) \u25e6 \u03b8 (j) indeed equals\n\u03b8 (i+j) whenever\nj < pl0 +1 . Using again this decomposition and the\n\u0010 l i\u0011+\np\nconditions \u03b8 (p ) = 0, one verifies that \u03b8 (i) \u25e6 \u03b8 (j) = 0 whenever i, j > 0\n\nand i + j = pl0 +1 . Hence the iteration rule holds on L up to level pl0 +1 .\n(1)\u21d4(3) We only have to show that (3) implies (1). Since the set for which the\niteration rule holds up to level pl0 +1 is a subfield of L (cf. Lemma 2.2(1))\nand since x1 , . . . , xk generate F (x1 , . . . , xk ) over F it is immediate that\nthe iteration rule holds up to level pl0 +1 on F (x1 , . . . , xk ). But an\nextension of an iterative derivation to a finite separable field extension\nis unique, and again an iterative derivation. So the iteration rule holds\non L up to level pl0 +1 .\n(2)\u21d4(3') This is shown in a similar way.\n\n\f10\n\nANDREAS MAURISCHAT\n\n(1),(2) \u21d2(4) By the iteration rule resp. condition (2)(a), one has\nl\n\n\u03bei,m+apl = \u03b8 (m+ap ) (xi ) =\n\n1 \u0010 (pl ) \u0011a\n1 \u0010 (pl ) \u0011a (m)\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u25e6 \u03b8 (xi ) =\n(\u03bei,m )\na!\na!\n\nfor all 0 < m \u2264 pl and 0 < a < p s.t. m + apl < pl+1 .

Example\n\nIn this section we give an example to illustrate the previous sections. In this\nexample it is even possible to give a recursive formula for constructing an iterative derivation \u03b8 which is compatible with the addition map (see Theorem\n6.3). Indeed, it will be a sharpening of the formula in Thm. 5.1, Item 4.\nThe example we consider is the elliptic curve E/C in characteristic p = 2 given\nby the equation x3 = z 2 + z, the neutral element of addition being given by the\npoint (0, 0).\nAs before, KE /C denotes the function field of E/C, and L = KE (t) = C(x, z, t)\nis the HD-field with a higher derivation \u03b8 extending the iterative derivation\nwith respect toP\nt on C(t). The iterative derivatives of x are denoted by \u03bem ,\nm\ni.e. \u03b8(x) =: x + \u221e\nm=1 \u03bem T , and \u03b7L := (x, z) \u2208 E(L) is the generic point of E.\nFurthermore, D = KE denotes the ID-field with trivial iterative derivation.\nLemma 6.1. For two points (x1 , z1 ) and (x2 , z2 ) the difference (xd , zd ) :=\n(x1 , z1 ) \u2296 (x2 , z2 ) is given by:\n!2\nz1\nz2 \u2212 1+z\nx1\n1\n+\nxd = x2 +\nx1\n1 + z1\nx2 \u2212 1+z\n1\nand\nzd =\n\nz2 \u2212\nx2 \u2212\n\nz1\n1+z1\nx1\n1+z1\n\n* (xd \u2212 x2 ) + z2\n\nProof. One only has to check, that the point (xd , zd ) is the third intersection\nof the elliptic curve with the line passing through (x2 , z2 ) and \u2296(x1 , z1 ) =\nx1\n( 1+z\n, z1 ).\n\u0003\n1 1+z1\nLet\nf (T ) :=\n\n\u221e\nX\nk=0\n\nfm T\n\nm\n\nx\n+\n:= \u03b8(x) +\n1+z\n\n\u03b8(z) \u2212\n\u03b8(x) \u2212\n\nz\n1+z\nx\n1+z\n\n!2\n\n\u2208 L[[T ]].\n\nThen by the previous lemma, f (T ) is the x-coordinate of \u03b7L \u2296 \u03b8\u2217 (\u03b7L ). For the\ncoefficients fm we have: f0 = 0, fm = \u03bem for odd m and fm = \u03bem + (fem )2 for\neven m > 0 and an appropriate element fem \u2208 L, depending only on x, z and\nthe elements \u03bek for k \u2264 m/2.\nFurthermore, let g(T ) denote the z-coordinate of \u03b7L \u2296 \u03b8\u2217 (\u03b7L ), i.e. \u03b7L \u2296 \u03b8\u2217 (\u03b7L ) =\n(f (T ), g(T )) in these local coordinates. Since this is a point on E, one has\n\n\f12\n\nANDREAS MAURISCHAT\n\nthe relation f (T )3 = g(T )2 + g(T ), and hence the coefficients gm of g(T ) =:\nP\n\u221e\nm can be expressed in terms of the f . In more detail, g = g =\nm\n0\n1\nk=0 gm T\ng2 = 0 and gm can be written as a polynomial in f1 , . . . , fm\u22122 .\nLemma 6.2. Assume that \u03b8 is an iterative derivation on L. Then for even\n\u0001\n(m+j)/2\u0001\nm, j \u2208 N\\{0} the difference \u03b8 (m) (fj )\u2212 m+j\nf(m+j)/2 ,\nm fm+j is a polynomial in\nm/2\nf(m+j)/2\u22121 , . . . , f1 , whereas for all other choices of m, j \u2208 N this difference is 0.\nProof. By definition, f (T ) is the x-coordinate of \u03b7L \u2296\u03b8\u2217 (\u03b7L ), hence \u03b8U [[T ]](f (T ))\nis the x-coordinate of (\u03b8U [[T ]])\u2217 (\u03b7L \u2296 \u03b8\u2217 (\u03b7L )). But\n(\u03b8U [[T ]])\u2217 (\u03b7L \u2296 \u03b8\u2217 (\u03b7L )) = \u03b8U,\u2217 (\u03b7L ) \u2296 (\u03b8U [[T ]])\u2217 (\u03b8\u2217 (\u03b7L ))\n= \u03b8U,\u2217 (\u03b7L ) \u2296 \u03b7L \u2295 \u03b7L \u2296 \u03b8U +T,\u2217 (\u03b7L )\n\u0001\n\u0001\n= \u03b7L \u2296 \u03b8U +T,\u2217 (\u03b7L ) \u2296 \u03b7L \u2296 \u03b8U,\u2217 (\u03b7L )\n\nHence, (\u03b8U [[T ]](f (T )), \u03b8U [[T ]](g(T ))) = (f (U + T ), g(U + T )) \u2296 (f (U ), g(U )).\nUsing the formula for the difference, we obtain\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f62\ng(T +U )\ng(U\n)\n\u2212\nf (T + U )\n1+g(T +U ) \uf8f8\n\u03b8U [[T ]](f (T )) = f (U ) +\n+\uf8ed\n\u2208 L[[T, U ]].\n1 + g(T + U )\nf (U ) \u2212 f (T +U )\n1+g(T +U )\n\nThe coefficient of U m T j on the left hand side is \u03b8 (m) (fj ). For the right hand\nside, we first remark that\n\u00012\n\u0001\u22122\nf (T + U )\n= f (T + U ) + g(T + U )/(T + U ) * f (T + U )/(T + U ) ,\n1 + g(T + U )\n\nas power series in (T + U ). So the right hand side is f (U ) + f (T + U ) modulo\nsquares.\u0001 This already shows that the coefficient of U m T j on the right hand side\nis m+j\nm fm+j , if m or j are odd.\nFor the other coefficients one has to have a closer look at the equation.

If k = 2l , condition (\u2217l ) and the calculations\nabove imply that\n\u0010P l\n2 0 \u22121\n(2j )\n\n(\u2020)\n\n2l+1\nX\u22121\n\n\u03b8 (m) (f2l )tm \u2208 C(t).\n\nm=0\n\nBy using Lemma 6.2, and f2l +m \u2208 C(t) as well as fj \u2208 C(t) for 1 \u2264 j \u2264\n2l \u2212 1, we see that \u03b8 (m) (f2l ) is an element of C(t) for 0 < m < 2l , and also\nl+1 \u0001\nl\n2l \u0001\n\u03b8 (2 ) (f2l ) \u2208 C(t), since 2 2l and 2l\u22121\nare \u0010\nboth zero \u0011in characteristic 2. For\nl\n\nl\n\n2l < m < 2l+1 , we have \u03b8 (m) (f2l ) = \u03b8 (m\u22122 ) \u03b8 (2 ) (f2l ) \u2208 C(t). Therefore all\n\u0003\nthe terms in (\u2020) different from f2l are in C(t) and hence f2l \u2208 C(t).\nReferences\n\n[1] Tobias Dyckerhoff.
