Payoffs are generated in the last step involving quantum measurement on the final state. This approach assumes familiarity with\nthe concepts of product or entangled quantum state(s), expectation values, trace\noperation, density operators, and the theory of quantum measurement.\nThis paper presents a probabilistic approach to quantum games that constructs true quantum games from probabilities only. Our motivation has been\nto present quantum game to the wider audience, especially to those readers who\nuse elements of game theory but find the concepts of quantum mechanics rather\nalien. We use probabilities to construct quantum games because, after all, Bell\n\n1\n\n\finequalities [2] can also be understood in this way, widely believed to express\nthe true quantum behavior.\nWe extend our probabilistic framework [3] for two-player quantum games\nto mutliplayer case, while using non-factorizable joint probabilities to construct\nquantum games. Apart from opening quantum games to the readers outside of\nthe quantum physics, this framework provides a unifying perspective on both\nthe classical and the quantum games.\n\n2\n\nThree-player, two-strategy, non-cooperative,\nsymmetric games\n\nWe consider three-player symmetric games for which players' pure strategies are\ngiven as Alice: S1 , S2 ; Bob: S1\u2032 , S2\u2032 ; Chris: S1\u2032\u2032 , S2\u2032\u2032 , and players' payoff relations\nare\n\u03a0A,B,C (S1 , S1\u2032 , S1\u2032\u2032 ) = \u03b1, \u03b1, \u03b1;\n\u03a0A,B,C (S2 , S1\u2032 , S1\u2032\u2032 ) = \u03b2, \u03b4, \u03b4;\n\u03a0A,B,C (S1 , S2\u2032 , S1\u2032\u2032 ) = \u03b4, \u03b2, \u03b4;\n\u03a0A,B,C (S1 , S1\u2032 , S2\u2032\u2032 ) = \u03b4, \u03b4, \u03b2;\n\n\u03a0A,B,C (S1 , S2\u2032 , S2\u2032\u2032 ) = \u01eb, \u03b8, \u03b8;\n\u03a0A,B,C (S2 , S1\u2032 , S2\u2032\u2032 ) = \u03b8, \u01eb, \u03b8;\n\u03a0A,B,C (S2 , S2\u2032 , S1\u2032\u2032 ) = \u03b8, \u03b8, \u01eb;\n\u03a0A,B,C (S2 , S2\u2032 , S2\u2032\u2032 ) = \u03c9, \u03c9, \u03c9,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the subscripts refer to the players, the three entries in braces on left\nside are pure strategies of Alice, Bob, and Chris, respectively, and the three\nentries on right are their payoffs. The three-player Prisoners' Dilemma offers an\nexample of such a game.\n\n2.1\n\nThree-player Prisoners' Dilemma\n\nIn this game each of the three players Alice, Bob, and Chris has two pure\nstrategies: C (Cooperation) and D (Defection). Using the notation introduced\nin (1) we associate\nAlice: S1 \u223c C, S2 \u223c D; Bob: S1\u2032 \u223c C, S2\u2032 \u223c D; Chris: S1\u2032\u2032 \u223c C, S2\u2032\u2032 \u223c D. (2)\nThe three-player Prisoners' Dilemma [4] is defined by requiring that S2 is a\ndominant choice for each player:\n\u03a0A (S2 , S1\u2032 , S1\u2032\u2032 ) >\n\n\u03a0A (S1 , S1\u2032 , S1\u2032\u2032 ),\n\n\u03a0A (S2 , S2\u2032 , S2\u2032\u2032 ) >\n\u03a0A (S2 , S1\u2032 , S2\u2032\u2032 ) >\n\n\u03a0A (S1 , S2\u2032 , S2\u2032\u2032 ),\n\u03a0A (S1 , S1\u2032 , S2\u2032\u2032 ),\n\n(3)\n\nand similar inequalities hold for players Bob and Chris. Secondly, a player is\nbetter off if more of his opponents choose to cooperate:\n\u03a0A (S2 , S1\u2032 , S1\u2032\u2032 ) > \u03a0A (S2 , S1\u2032 , S2\u2032\u2032 ) > \u03a0A (S2 , S2\u2032 , S2\u2032\u2032 ),\n\u03a0A (S1 , S1\u2032 , S1\u2032\u2032 ) > \u03a0A (S1 , S1\u2032 , S2\u2032\u2032 ) > \u03a0A (S1 , S2\u2032 , S2\u2032\u2032 ).\n2\n\n(4)\n\n\fThirdly, if one player's choice is fixed, the other two players are left in the\nsituation of a two-player PD:\n\u03a0A (S1 , S1\u2032 , S2\u2032\u2032 ) > \u03a0A (S2 , S2\u2032 , S2\u2032\u2032 ),\n\u03a0A (S1 , S1\u2032 , S1\u2032\u2032 ) > \u03a0A (S2 , S1\u2032 , S2\u2032\u2032 ),\n\u03a0A (S1 , S1\u2032 , S2\u2032\u2032 ) > (1/2) {\u03a0A (S1 , S2\u2032 , S2\u2032\u2032 ) + \u03a0A (S2 , S1\u2032 , S2\u2032\u2032 )} ,\n\u03a0A (S1 , S1\u2032 , S1\u2032\u2032 ) > (1/2) {\u03a0A (S1 , S1\u2032 , S2\u2032\u2032 ) + \u03a0A (S2 , S1\u2032 , S1\u2032\u2032 )} .\n\n(5)\n\nUsing the notation (1) these conditions require\na) \u03b2 > \u03b1, \u03c9 > \u01eb, \u03b8 > \u03b4\nb) \u03b2 > \u03b8 > \u03c9, \u03b1 > \u03b4 > \u01eb\nc) \u03b4 > \u03c9, \u03b1 > \u03b8, \u03b4 > (1/2)(\u01eb + \u03b8), \u03b1 > (1/2)(\u03b4 + \u03b2)\n\n3\n\n(6)\n\nPlaying three-player games using coins\n\nThe above game can be played using coins and in the following we consider two\nsetups to achieve this.\n\n3.1\n\nThree-coin setup\n\nThis setup involves sharing three coins among Alice, Bob, and Chris. We define\npure strategies by the association:\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nS1 , S1 , S1\u2032\u2032 \u223c flip, S2 , S2 , S2\u2032\u2032 \u223c do not flip, Head \u223c +1, Tail \u223c \u22121,\n\n(7)\n\nand play the game as follows. In a run each player receives a coin in 'head up'\nstate which s/he can 'flip' or 'does not flip'. After players' actions the coins are\npassed to a referee. The referee observes the coins and rewards the players. A\nplayer can play a mixed strategy (definable for many runs) by flipping his/her\ncoin with some probability. This allows us to write mixed strategies as (x, y, z)\nwhere x, y, and z are the probabilities with which Alice, Bob, and Chris flip\ntheir coins, respectively. The mixed-strategy payoff relations read\n\u03a0A,B,C (x, y, z) = xyz(\u03b1, \u03b1, \u03b1) + x(1 \u2212 y)z(\u03b4, \u03b2, \u03b4) + xy(1 \u2212 z)(\u03b4, \u03b4, \u03b2)+\nx(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 z)(\u01eb, \u03b8, \u03b8) + (1 \u2212 x)yz(\u03b2, \u03b4, \u03b4) + (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)z(\u03b8, \u03b8, \u01eb)+\n(1 \u2212 x)y(1 \u2212 z)(\u03b8, \u01eb, \u03b8) + (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 z)(\u03c9, \u03c9, \u03c9)\n\n(8)\n\nAssuming (x\u22c6 , y \u22c6 , z \u22c6 ) to be a Nash equilibrium (NE) requires:\n\u03a0A (x\u22c6 , y \u22c6 , z \u22c6 ) \u2212 \u03a0A (x, y \u22c6 , z \u22c6 ) > 0,\n\u03a0B (x\u22c6 , y \u22c6 , z \u22c6 ) \u2212 \u03a0B (x\u22c6 , y, z \u22c6 ) > 0,\n\u03a0C (x\u22c6 , y \u22c6 , z \u22c6 ) \u2212 \u03a0B (x\u22c6 , y \u22c6 , z) > 0.\n\n3\n\n(9)\n\n\f3.2\n\nSix-coin setup\n\nThis setup translates playing of a three-player game in terms of joint probabilities which may attain the unusual character of being non-factorizable for certain\nquantum systems. The setup thus allows how non-factorizable (quantum) probabilities lead to game-theoretic consequences.\nIn this setup, each player receives two coins (either one can be in head or\ntail state) and each player chooses one out of the two coins given to him/her.\nPlayers pass three chosen coins to the referee who tosses the three chosen coins\nand observes the outcome. After many runs the referee rewards the players.\nPlayers' strategies are defined by establishing the association:\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nS1 , S1 , S1\u2032 \u223c choose the first coin, S2 , S2 , S2\u2032 \u223c choose the second coin\n\n(10)\nA player plays a pure strategy when h/she chooses the same coin for all runs.\nHe/she plays a mixed-strategy if he/she chooses her/his first coin with some\nprobability over many runs. We define x, y, and z to be the probabilities of\nchoosing the first coin by Alice, Bob, and Chris, respectively.\nNote that the quantities x, y, and z, though being mathematically similar\nin three- and six-coin setups, are physically different in the following sense.\nIn three-coin setup does not require many runs for the pure-strategy game.\nWhereas in the six-coin setup many runs are required for both the 'pure strategy'\nand the 'mixed strategy' games.\nIn six-coin setup one can define the individual coin probabilities as\nr = Pr(+1; S1 ), r\u2032 = Pr(+1; S1\u2032 ), r\u2032\u2032 = Pr(+1; S1\u2032\u2032 ),\ns = Pr(+1; S2 ), s\u2032 = Pr(+1; S2\u2032 ), s\u2032\u2032 = Pr(+1; S2\u2032\u2032 ),\n\n(11)\n\nthen factorizability of joint probabilities is expressed, for example, as\nPr(+1, \u22121, \u22121; S2, S1\u2032 , S2\u2032\u2032 ) = s(1 \u2212 r\u2032 )(1 \u2212 s\u2032\u2032 ).\n\n(12)\n\nWe define pure-strategy payoffs by the expressions like\n\u03a0A,B,C (S2 , S1\u2032 , S1\u2032\u2032 ) = (\u03b1, \u03b1, \u03b1)sr\u2032 r\u2032\u2032 + (\u03b4, \u03b2, \u03b4)s(1 \u2212 r\u2032 )r\u2032\u2032 + (\u03b4, \u03b4, \u03b2)sr\u2032 (1 \u2212 r\u2032\u2032 )+\n(\u01eb, \u03b8, \u03b8)s(1 \u2212 r\u2032 )(1 \u2212 r\u2032\u2032 ) + (\u03b2, \u03b4, \u03b4)(1 \u2212 s)r\u2032 r\u2032\u2032 + (\u03b8, \u03b8, \u01eb)(1 \u2212 s)(1 \u2212 r\u2032 )r\u2032\u2032 +\n(\u03b8, \u01eb, \u03b8)(1 \u2212 s)r\u2032 (1 \u2212 r\u2032\u2032 ) + (\u03c9, \u03c9, \u03c9)(1 \u2212 s)(1 \u2212 r\u2032 )(1 \u2212 r\u2032\u2032 ),\n(13)\nwhile the mixed-strategy payoffs are\n\u03a0A,B,C (x, y, z) = xyz\u03a0A,B,C (S1 , S1\u2032 , S1\u2032\u2032 ) + x(1 \u2212 y)z\u03a0A,B,C (S1 , S2\u2032 , S1\u2032\u2032 )+\nxy(1 \u2212 z)\u03a0A,B,C (S1 , S1\u2032 , S2\u2032\u2032 ) + x(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 z)\u03a0A,B,C (S1 , S2\u2032 , S2\u2032\u2032 )+\n(1 \u2212 x)yz\u03a0A,B,C (S2 , S1\u2032 , S1\u2032\u2032 ) + (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)z\u03a0A,B,C (S2 , S2\u2032 , S1\u2032\u2032 )+\n(1 \u2212 x)y(1 \u2212 z)\u03a0A,B,C (S2 , S1\u2032 , S2\u2032\u2032 ) + (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 z)\u03a0A,B,C (S2 , S2\u2032 , S2\u2032\u2032 ).\n(14)\n\n4\n\n\fA triple (x\u22c6 , y \u22c6 , z \u22c6 ) is a NE when\n\u03a0A (x\u22c6 , y \u22c6 , z \u22c6 ) \u2212 \u03a0A (x, y \u22c6 , z \u22c6 ) > 0,\n\u03a0B (x\u22c6 , y \u22c6 , z \u22c6 ) \u2212 \u03a0B (x\u22c6 , y, z \u22c6 ) > 0,\n\u03a0C (x\u22c6 , y \u22c6 , z \u22c6 ) \u2212 \u03a0B (x\u22c6 , y \u22c6 , z) > 0.\n\n3.3\n\n(15)\n\nPlaying the Prisoner's Dilemma\n\nConsider playing three-player Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) using the three-coin\nsetup.

In six-coin setup we analyze this game when (s, s\u2032 , s\u2032\u2032 ) =\n(0, 0, 0), saying that the probability of getting head from each player's second\ncoin is zero.

In analogy with the six-coin setup, this is achieved by establishing the\nassociation:\n\u2032\n\nS1 , S1 , S1\u2032 \u223c choose the first direction,\n\u2032\nS2 , S2 , S2\u2032 \u223c choose the second direction.\n\n(21)\n\nNow, in a run, each player chooses one direction out of the two and the\nreferee is informed about players' choices. The referee rotates Stern-Gerlach\ntype apparatus along the three chosen directions and performs (quantum) measurement, the outcome of which, along all the three directions, is either +1 or\n\u22121.\nComparing the three-party EPR setting to the six-coin setup shows that in\na run, choosing between two directions of measurement is similar to choosing\nbetween the two coins. The outcome of (quantum) measurement is +1 or \u22121\nas it is the case with the coins.\nWe now denote the joint probabilities in the three-party EPR setting as\np1\np2\np3\np4\n\np61\n= Pr(+1, +1, +1; S1, S1\u2032 , S1\u2032\u2032 ),\np\n= Pr(+1, \u22121, +1; S1, S1\u2032 , S1\u2032\u2032 ),\n... 62\np63\n= Pr(+1, +1, \u22121; S1, S1\u2032 , S1\u2032\u2032 ),\n= Pr(+1, \u22121, \u22121; S1, S1\u2032 , S1\u2032\u2032 ),\np64\n\n= Pr(\u22121, +1, +1; S2, S2\u2032 , S2\u2032\u2032 ),\n= Pr(\u22121, \u22121, +1; S2, S2\u2032 , S2\u2032\u2032 ),\n= Pr(\u22121, +1, \u22121; S2, S2\u2032 , S2\u2032\u2032 ),\n= Pr(\u22121, \u22121, \u22121; S2, S2\u2032 , S2\u2032\u2032 ),\n\n(22)\n\nwhich for coins are reduced to the factorizable joint probabilities involved in the\nsix-coin setup.\n\n6\n\n\fQuantum mechanics imposes constraints on the joint probabilities involved\nin the three-party EPR setting. These are usually known as the normalization\nand the causal communication constraints [5]. Normalization says that\nP8\n\ni=1\n\npi = 1,\n\nP16\n\ni=9\n\npi = 1, ...\n\nP64\n\ni=57\n\npi = 1.\n\n(23)\n\nWhile, the causal communication constraint is expressed as\nP4\nP20\nP28\nP36\npi = i=17 pi = i=25 pi = i=33 pi\ni=1\nP8\nP24\nP32\nP40\npi = i=21 pi = i=29 pi = i=37 pi\nPi=5\nP\nP\nP60\n12\n44\n52\ni=9 pi = Pi=41 pi = Pi=49 pi = Pi=57 pi\nP16\n48\n56\n64\ni=13 pi =\ni=45 pi =\ni=53 pi =\ni=61 pi\nP4\nP8\nP16\nP24\np2i\u22121 = i=5 p2i\u22121 = i=13 p2i\u22121 = i=21 p2i\u22121\ni=1P\nP24\nP16\nP8\n4\np = i=13 p2i = i=21 p2i\np =\nP32\nP28\nP12 i=1 2i P20 i=5 2i\np2i\u22121 = i=17 p2i\u22121 = i=25 p2i\u22121 = i=29 p2i\u22121\ni=9P\nP\nP\nP\n12\n20\n28\n32\ni=9 p2i =\ni=17 p2i =\ni=25 p2i =\ni=29 p2i\n\n(24)\n\n(25)\n\np1 + p2 + p5 + p6 = p17 + p18 + p21 + p22 = p9 + p10 + p13 + p14 = p49 + p50 + p53 + p54 ,\np3 + p4 + p7 + p8 = p19 + p20 + p23 + p24 = p11 + p12 + p15 + p16 = p51 + p52 + p55 + p56 ,\np25 + p26 + p29 + p30 = p33 + p34 + p37 + p38 = p41 + p42 + p45 + p46 = p57 + p58 + p61 + p62 ,\np27 + p28 + p31 + p32 = p35 + p36 + p39 + p40 = p43 + p44 + p47 + p48 = p59 + p60 + p63 + p64 .\n(26)\nEssentially, these constraints state that, in a run, on referee's measurement,\nthe outcome of +1 or \u22121 along Alice's chosen direction is independent of what\nchoices Bob and Chris make for their directions. The same applies for Bob and\nChris.\nNotice that the factorizable joint probabilities also satisfy the causal communication constraint as do the three-party EPR joint probabilities. Whereas,\nunlike the coin probabilities, the three-party EPR joint probabilities can be\nnon-factorizable. In this case if (22) are expressed as (17) one of more of the\nprobabilities r, r\u2032 , r\u2032\u2032 , s, s\u2032 , s\u2032\u2032 becomes negative or greater than one.\n\n4.1\n\nThree-player quantum Prisoner's Dilemma\n\nNotice that the constraints (19) ensure that for a factorizable joint probabilities\nthe triple (D, D, D) becomes a NE and that requiring that a set of (quantum\nmechanical) joint probabilities to satisfy the constraints (19) imbeds the classical\ngame within the corresponding quantum game.\nWe now consider playing the three-player PD using the three-party EPR setting. We ask whether the triple (C, C, C) can be a NE for non-factorizable joint\nprobabilities while our setup ensures that for factorizable three-party EPR joint\nprobabilities the game can be interpreted classically, with the triple (D, D, D)\nbeing its unique NE. To answer this we use (20), (23), and (24-26) to find the NE\nfrom (15) and allow the involved joint probabilities to become non-factorizable.\n\n7\n\n\fFor two-player PD we have reported that (D, D, D) once again emerges as\nthe unique NE with the same definition of players' strategies and under the\nrequirements that embed the classical game within the quantum.\nFor three-player PD the situation, however, comes out to be different. The\nNash inequalities for the triple (C, C, C) then read\n{p5 + (\u03b1/\u03b2)p1 \u2212 p13 } + (\u03b8/\u03b2) {p6 + p7 \u2212 p14 \u2212 p15 + (\u03b4/\u03b8)(p2 + p3 )} +\n(\u03c9/\u03b2) {p8 \u2212 p16 + (\u01eb/\u03c9)p4 } \u2265 0;\n\n(27)\n\n{p2 + (\u03b1/\u03b2)p1 \u2212 p18 } + (\u03b8/\u03b2) {p4 + p6 \u2212 p20 \u2212 p22 + (\u03b4/\u03b8)(p3 + p5 )} +\n(\u03c9/\u03b2) {p8 \u2212 p24 + (\u01eb/\u03c9)p7 } \u2265 0;\n\n(28)\n\n{p3 + (\u03b1/\u03b2)p1 \u2212 p27 } + (\u03b8/\u03b2) {p4 + p7 \u2212 p28 \u2212 p31 + (\u03b4/\u03b8)(p2 + p5 )} +\n(\u03c9/\u03b2) {p8 \u2212 p32 + (\u01eb/\u03c9)p6 } \u2265 0;\n\n(29)\n\nwhere \u03b1/\u03b2, \u03b8/\u03b2, \u03b4/\u03b8, \u03c9/\u03b2, \u01eb/\u03c9 < 1. We find that a set of (quantum) joint\nprobabilities that satisfy the normalization and the causal communication constraints can indeed allow the inequalities (27-29) to be true. For example, take\n\u03b1/\u03b2 = 9/10, \u03b8/\u03b2 = 1/100, \u03b4/\u03b8 = 1/5, \u03c9/\u03b2 = 1/100, \u01eb/\u03c9 = 9/10 and assign\nvalues to these joint probabilities as p1 = 1/10, p3 = 13/100, p5 = 16/100,\np6 = 1/10, p13 = 14/100, p15 = 2/5, p18 = 13/100, p20 = 1/4, p22 = 37/100,\np27 = 1/5 which we call as the 'independent probabilities'. Notice that constraints (19) assign zero value to thirty seven joint probabilities out of the\nremaining ones and using the normalization and causal communication constraints the values assigned to the rest of joint probabilities are then found as\np2 = 7/50, p4 = 1/100, p7 = 3/20, p8 = 21/100, p14 = 9/25, p16 = 1/10,\np24 = 1/4, p28 = 9/50, p31 = 17/50, p32 = 7/25, p36 = 19/50, p40 = 31/50,\np47 = 27/50, p48 = 23/50, p54 = 1/2, p56 = 1/2. With this the above NE\ninequalities for (C, C, C) reduce to 0.106 \u2265 0, 0.096 \u2265 0, 0.017 \u2265 0 which are\ntrivially true.\nNote that for PD we have \u03b1/\u03b2, \u03b8/\u03b2, \u03b4/\u03b8, \u03c9/\u03b2, and \u01eb/\u03c9 all less than zero and\nnot every non-factorizable set of joint probabilities can result in (C, C, C) being\na NE. In this paper we do not explore which other NE may emerge for a given\nnon-factorizable set of probabilities. However, we notice that the classical outcome of (D, D, D) being a NE remains intact even when the joint probabilities\nmay become non-factorizable. This means that a set of non-factorizable joint\nprobabilities can only add to the unique classical NE in the three-player PD.\n\n5\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nWe use three-party EPR setting to play a three-player symmetric noncooperative game. Players' payoffs are re-expressed in terms of players' choices in the\nEPR setting and in terms of the joint probabilities. We use Nash inequalities\n8\n\n\fin the six-coin setup to impose constraints on joint probabilities which ensure\nthat with factorizable joint probabilities the game has a classical interpretation. We then retain these constraints while allowing the joint probabilities to\nbecome non-factorizable and find how non-factorizable probabilities may lead\nto the emergence of new solutions of the game. Multi-player quantum games\nare, therefore, constructed in terms of probabilities only and it is shown that\nnon-factorizable joint probabilities may lead to different game-theoretic outcome(s). We find that with this framework it is hard to construct Enk & Pike\ntype argument [6] for a quantum game.\nAcknowledgement 1 One of us (AI) is supported by the Japan Society for\nPromotion of Science (JSPS).
