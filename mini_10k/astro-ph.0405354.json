The significance of the outflows is\nillustrated by the fact that the inferred mass-loss rates are comparable to the mass-accretion\nrates (Crenshaw, Kraemer, & George 2003a). Dynamical models of the outflowing absorbers\nmake use of thermal winds, radiation pressure, and/or hydromagnetic flows from the central\naccretion disk, presumably responsible for most of the continuum radiation, or from the\nnearby broad-line region or torus. To constrain the dynamical models, and in particular to\ntest the hypothesis that radiation pressure is the driving force, it is important to determine\ntheir rate of occurrence and variation in properties as functions of the luminosity of the\ncentral continuum source.\nAt luminosities higher than those of Seyferts, a significant fraction of quasars (25%\nto 55%) show intrinsic absorption in the UV (Ganguly et al. 2001; Laor & Brandt 2002;\nVestergaard 2003) and X-rays (George et al. 2000). However, the case for intrinsic absorption\nin low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) has not been firmly established. Shields et\nal. (2002) find that LINERs often show absorption lines, but these can usually be attributed\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nto the interstellar medium (ISM) in their host galaxies, and there is little evidence in most\ncases for absorbers outflowing from their nuclei.\nTo date, NGC 4395 provides the best case for a low-luminosity AGN with intrinsic\nabsorption that could possibly be attributed to the nucleus. NGC 4395 is an Sd III-IV dwarf\ngalaxy that harbors one of the nearest (d \u2248 4.6 Mpc, Karachentsev et al. 2003) and least\nluminous (Lbol \u2248 5 \u00d7 1040 ergs s\u22121 , Moran et al. 2004) AGN known. The active nucleus\ncan be thought of as a dwarf Seyfert 1, since it possesses a bright central continuum source\nthat is rapidly variable in the X-rays (Lira et al. 1999; Moran et al. 1999, 2004; Shih et al.\n2003, hereafter SH2003) as well as broad and narrow emission lines that are photoionized by\nthe central source (Kraemer et al. 1999). A variety of evidence indicates that the nucleus\nharbors a relatively low mass (104 \u2013 105 M\u2299 ) black hole that is responsible for powering the\nnuclear activity (Filippenko & Ho 2003). The broad permitted lines, strong high-ionization\nlines (Kraemer et al. 1999), and relatively high accretion rate (Lbol /LEdd \u2248 2 \u2212 20 \u00d7 10\u22123 )\ncompared to that of LINERs (Lbol /LEdd < 10\u22123 , see Ho 1999) strongly support the Seyfert\n1 interpretation for NGC 4395.\nSeveral previous studies of NGC 4395 have made a case for intrinsic UV or X-ray\nabsorption from ionized gas in the line of sight to the nucleus. Faint Object Spectrograph\n(FOS) observations obtained at low spectral resolving power (\u03bb/\u2206\u03bb \u2248 1000) with the Hubble\nSpace Telescope (HST) show absorption features in the blue wing of the C IV emission line,\nat the observed wavelengths of 1544 and 1550 \u00c5 (Filippenko, Ho, & Sargent 1993; Kraemer\net al. 1999). Early X-ray observations with ROSAT (Lira et al. 1999; Moran et al. 1999)\nand ASCA (Iwasawa et al. 2000) showed evidence for absorption in soft X-rays, indicative\nof one or more X-ray \"warm absorbers.\" Subsequent Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO)\n(Moran et al. 2004) and long ASCA (SH2003) observations showed a downturn in the X-ray\n<\nspectrum at E \u223c\n3 keV, apparently due to absorption from highly ionized gas.\nIn an effort to confirm the presence of intrinsic UV absorption in NGC 4395, and\ndetermine its properties and connection with the claimed X-ray absorption, we have obtained\nnew observations with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) and the Space\nTelescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) on HST. We were also motivated by our previous\nstudy of the emission-line regions in NGC 4395 (Kraemer et al. 1999), which revealed that\n>\nboth the broad-line region (BLR) and narrow-line region (NLR) should have large ( \u223c\n50%)\ncovering factors of the central source, and thus might be detectable in absorption.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nWe observed the nucleus of NGC 4395 contemporaneously with FUSE and STIS at high\nspectral resolutions, to identify possible absorption systems in the UV. We obtained the\nFUSE observations on 2003 February 25 UT with a total exposure time of 36,000 s. We\nused the standard 30\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 30\u2032\u2032 low-resolution aperture (LWRS), which samples a much larger\ncircumnuclear region than our STIS observation (see below). We processed the FUSE data\nwith version 2.2.3 of the standard calibration pipeline, CALFUSE, which extracts spectra for\neach of the eight combinations of channels (SiC1, SiC2, LiF1, LiF2) and detector segments\n(A and B). Curvature in the LiF1B spectrum due to the anomalous feature known as \"the\nworm\" (Sanhow et al. 2002) was corrected by comparison to the LiF2A spectrum. The\nchannel/segments with overlapping wavelength coverage with the LiF1a spectrum were scaled\nto match its flux. All spectra were then co-added by weighting each channel/segment by\nits effective area, using the effective area versus wavelength functions given in Blair et al.\n(2000). The final calibrated spectrum covers the range 905 \u2013 1180 \u00c5 at a velocity resolution\nof \u223c15 km s\u22121 (full-width at half-maximum [FWHM] of the line-spread function).\nWe obtained STIS echelle spectra of the nucleus of NGC 4395 through the 0\u2032\u2032.2 \u00d7 0\u2032\u2032.2\naperture on 2003 March 9 UT. We used the E140M grating over three consecutive HST\norbits to yield a total exposure time of 8022 s; the spectra cover the range 1150 \u2013 1730 \u00c5 at\na velocity resolution of \u223c7 km s\u22121 (FWHM). We also obtained a 2182 sec exposure with the\nE230M grating during one orbit to cover the range 2271 \u2013 3119 \u00c5 at a velocity resolution\nof \u223c10 km s\u22121 (FWHM). We reduced the STIS spectra using the IDL software developed\nat NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center for the STIS Instrument Definition Team. The\ndata reduction included a procedure to remove the background light from each order using a\nscattered light model. The individual orders in each echelle spectrum were spliced together\nin the regions of overlap.\nWe measured the continuum fluxes of the three individual STIS E140M spectra and\nfound no significant (\u2265 10%) variations on short time scales (i.e., from one \u223c90 min orbit to\nthe next). The average and standard deviation of the continuum fluxes at 1345 \u00c5 (in a bin of\n30 \u00c5) are 1.55 (\u00b1 0.11) \u00d7 10\u221215 ergs s\u22121 cm\u22122 \u00c5\u22121 . This happens to be close to the 1345 \u00c5\ncontinuum flux from the FOS spectrum obtained on 1992 July 15, 19 (Filippenko, Ho, &\nSargent 1993): 1.41 \u00d7 10\u221215 ergs s\u22121 cm\u22122 \u00c5\u22121 . Given the lack of obvious variability on 90minute time scales, we averaged the E140M spectra together to improve the signal-to-noise\nratio.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n3.\n\nHot Stars in the FUSE Aperture\n\nComparison of the STIS and FUSE spectra in the region of overlap (1150 \u2013 1180 \u00c5)\nreveals that the FUSE continuum flux is 3.0 times higher than that from STIS. Although we\ncannot rule out variability in the UV continuum flux over the 12-day interval between the\nobservations, we demonstrate that the principal source of the flux discrepancy is the presence\nof hot stars in the large FUSE aperture. This is not surprising, since there is intense star\nformation occurring throughout NGC 4395 (Cedr\u00e9s & Cepa 2002).\nGiven that there are no available far-UV images of NGC 4395 (which will change with\nthe release of the GALEX all-sky survey), we test the hot-star hypothesis in three ways:\nwith a near-UV image, with the H\u03b1 images of Cedr\u00e9s & Cepa (2002), and by comparing the\nFUSE spectrum with starburst models from Leitherer et al. (1999). We have examined a\nnear-UV image (centered at 3300\u00c5) obtained with the Advance Camera for Surveys (ACS)\non HST on 2002 October 27 UT. The integrated flux in the 25\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 28\u2032\u2032 ACS image, which\nis close to the projected area of the FUSE aperture, is 3.1 times that measured in a region\ncorresponding to the STIS aperture (H.R. Schmitt et al. 2003, in preparation), in close\nagreement with the far-UV ratio measured from the spectra.\nCedr\u00e9s & Cepa (2002) detected three H\u03b1 sources inside the region covered by the FUSE\naperture: the nucleus, a source \u223c7\u2032\u2032 to the E, and another source \u223c5\u2032\u2032 to the S of the nucleus\n(regions 99, 98 and 97, respectively, in their paper). Assuming that all the nuclear H\u03b1\nemission is ionized by the AGN, we get that F (H\u03b1) = 4.45 \u00d7 10\u221214 ergs s\u22121 cm\u22122 for the\nother two sources. Based on this value, we calculate from equation (2) in Kennicutt (1998)\nthat this corresponds to a star formation rate of 8.4 \u00d7 10\u22124 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . This star formation\nrate corresponds to a far-ultraviolet flux of F \u03bb (1150 \u00c5) = 5.7 \u00d7 10\u221215 ergs s\u22121 cm\u22122 \u00c5\u22121\nusing equation (1) in Kennicutt (1998). These calculations are based on a continuous star\nformation rate over a period of \u223c100 Myr, which can give different results from the ones\nobtained using an instantaneous burst. According to Cedr\u00e9s & Cepa (2002), the equivalent\nwidths of H\u03b1 emission are log (EW/\u00c5) = 2.46 and 2.61 for regions 97 and 98, respectively.\nUsing the Starburst99 models for an instantaneous burst with metallicity 0.4 solar and\nSalpeter IMF (Leitherer et al. 1999), we find that these equivalent widths correspond to\nbursts with ages of \u223c5 Myr. Scaling the 5 Myr model to match the observed H\u03b1 flux, we get\na continuum flux of F \u03bb (1150 \u00c5) = 8.5 \u00d7 10\u221215 ergs s\u22121 cm\u22122 \u00c5\u22121 . Both of these estimates\nare close to the excess far-UV flux in the FUSE aperture of F\u03bb (1150 \u00c5) = 5.9 (\u00b11.1) \u00d7 10\u221215\nergs s\u22121 cm\u22122 \u00c5\u22121 .\nThe third test for the hot stars hypothesis was done by comparing the FUSE spectrum\nwith starburst models created using Starburst99 (Leitherer et al. 1999), which incorporate\nfar-UV stellar spectra from Robert et al. (2003). The models assume an instantaneous burst\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nwith a Salpeter IMF, upper and lower mass limits of 100 M\u2299 and 1 M\u2299 , respectively, and a\nmetallicity of 0.4Z\u2299 , which is consistent with the values measured by Cedr\u00e9s & Cepa (2002).\nWe restrict our comparison of the FUSE spectrum to models with ages between 3 Myr and\n7 Myr, which is consistent with the age obtained for regions 97 and 98 based on the equivalent\nwidths of H\u03b1. In order to compare the FUSE spectrum with the starburst models, we first\ncorrected the spectrum of NGC 4395 for Galactic reddening, using the value E(B-V) = 0.074\nfrom Schlegel, Finkbeiner & Davis (1998). Internal reddening is not a problem in the nucleus\nof this galaxy (Ho, Filippenko & Sargent 1997). We then corrected the spectrum for redshift,\nand resampled it to 0.13 \u00c5 in wavelength, which is the spectral resolution of the models.\nThe resulting spectrum is presented as a thin line in Figure 1. Since approximately\none third of the flux observed by FUSE at 1150 \u00c5 originates at the nucleus, we used the\nHST spectrum to determine the slope of the AGN continuum and extrapolate it to lower\nwavelengths. We did this by fitting a power law (F\u03bb \u221d \u03bb\u03b1 ) to the continuum regions in\nthe wavelength range 1268 \u2013 1730 \u00c5 (thereby avoiding possible contamination from stars at\nlonger wavelengths). We found that the AGN continuum can be represented by a power law\nwith slope \u03b1 = \u22120.59 \u00b1 0.58. The extrapolation of this power law to shorter wavelengths is\nshown as a thick dotted line in Figure 1. We also show a spectrum from a 5 Myr starburst\nmodel (thick solid line), scaled so that when added to the power law, its flux is the same\nas the one observed in NGC 4395 over the wavelength range 1102-1107\u00c5. Due to the low\nS/N ratio of the FUSE spectrum of NGC 4395, we did not attempt a detailed modeling of\nthe stellar absorption lines; comparison with starburst spectra with ages between 3 Myr and\n7 Myr did not show a significant difference, so we adopted the model which corresponded to\nthe age determined from the H\u03b1 equivalent widths. Most of the absorption lines detected\nin the spectrum are due to interstellar gas in our Galaxy or NGC 4395. However, several\nstellar absorption lines, notably from C III, S IV, P V and Si IV, are clearly present (we\ncould not detect O VI absorption because it is filled in with emission from the AGN). The\nstrengths of these lines are similar in NGC 4395 and in the model spectrum. A subtraction\nof the starburst plus power law model from the spectrum of NGC 4395 (bottom panel\nof Figure 1) successfully removes the strongest stellar and large-scale continuum features,\nleaving residuals primarily due to interstellar absorption and nuclear emission lines. Based on\nall the tests presented in this section, we conclude that a starburst is the correct explanation\nfor the excess emission observed by FUSE. This turns out to have important consequences\nfor the detection of intrinsic absorption in the FUSE aperture (\u00a75.3).\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n4.\n\nDetection and Measurement of Intrinsic UV Absorption\n\nDue to the relative faintness of NGC 4395, its STIS spectra are noisier than the STIS\nechelle spectra of other Seyfert galaxies that we have studied in the past (Crenshaw et al.\n2003a). The signal-to-noise ratio per resolution element is S/N = 2.3 in the regions of broad\nC IV emission surrounding the intrinsic absorption, whereas S/N \u2248 8 in these regions for\nsimilar exposure times in NGC 5548 (Crenshaw et al. 2003b). For the FUSE spectra, we\nestimate S/N \u2248 3 (per resolution element) in the O VI region. Since intrinsic absorption lines\nare expected to encompass many resolution elements (Crenshaw et al. 1999), we smoothed\nthe spectra by a 7-point boxcar function to search for absorption lines.\nFigure 2 shows portions of the STIS echelle spectra in regions where we have detected\nabsorption lines that are likely to be intrinsic to NGC 4395. From the narrow emission lines\nof the C IV doublet seen in the top panel, we have determined an emission-line redshift of\nz = 0.0012, close to the value of 0.0011 determined from H I 21-cm emission by Haynes\net al. (1998). We note that these emission lines are unusually narrow compared to those\nof normal Seyfert galaxies; for C IV the FWHM is 65 km s\u22121 , similar to the value of \u223c50\nkm s\u22121 determined for various narrow emission lines from a high-resolution optical spectrum\nof NGC 4395 (Filippenko & Ho 2003). Unfortunately, the N V \u03bb\u03bb1238.8, 1242.8 region is\nvery noisy, and no absorption (not even Galactic) was detected in this region. Strong, broad\nGalactic Ly\u03b1 absorption prevents detection of any intrinsic Ly\u03b1 absorption.\nMost of the absorption lines that we have detected in the STIS spectra can be attributed\nto the Galaxy, at a radial velocity of \u221229 km s\u22121 in the observed frame (\u2212389 km s\u22121 in\nFigure 2). However, we have identified two possible kinematic components of absorption\nthat could be intrinsic to NGC 4395. Component 1 at \u2212770 km s\u22121 (with respect to z =\n0.0012) is only evident in the C IV \u03bb1548.2 line. The associated C IV \u03bb1550.8 line is blended\nwith Galactic absorption, so we regard this identification as tentative. There is little or no\nlow-ionization gas associated with this component; in particular, there is no obvious Mg II\nabsorption. Component 2 at \u2212114 km s\u22121 is seen in the lines of C IV \u03bb\u03bb1548.2, 1550.8,\nSi IV \u03bb\u03bb1393.8, 1402.8, Mg II \u03bb\u03bb2796.3, 2803.5, and O I \u03bb1302.2 (also C II \u03bb1334.5, which is\nnot shown). Although the lines from Component 2 do not align perfectly, it is not possible\nto determine if this is due to ion-dependent velocity structure or just noise. Component\n2 appears to be heavily saturated in all lines except for C IV. In the top panel of Figure\n2, we have overplotted the 1992 FOS spectrum (corrected to match the STIS spectrum by\nadding 2 \u00c5 to the wavelength scale). The two broad dips in the FOS spectrum correspond\nto our claims of absorption features at 1544 and 1550 \u00c5 (Filippenko, Ho, & Sargent 1993;\nKraemer et al. 1999). These can now be attributed to blends of the intrinsic and Galactic\nabsorption lines that we have identified in the STIS spectrum, plus some contribution of the\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\ngap between the narrow C IV emission doublet to the dip at 1550 \u00c5 (+ 300 km s\u22121 in the\nplot).\nFigure 3 shows portions of the FUSE spectra. Due to the low S/N at short wavelengths,\nwe were unable to detect even Galactic absorption in the expected lines of C III \u03bb977.0\nand N III \u03bb989.8. However, Ly\u03b2 and C II \u03bb1036.3 are clearly present in Component 2.\nThe Ly\u03b2 absorption at Component 2 is not just the wing of the Galactic component, since\nsymmetric absorption is not present on the other (more negative) side of geocoronal Ly\u03b2\nemission. As the top panel of Figure 3 shows, we have not detected O VI absorption in any\ncomponent, despite the reasonably decent S/N (the absorption near the expected locations\nof Components 1 and G in O VI \u03bb1037.6 is due to C II, as shown in the bottom panel).\nTo further characterize the absorption components, we have measured their radial velocity centroids and equivalent widths (EWs) assuming full coverage of the continuum and\nline emission. We determined uncertainties in the absorption measurements from photon\nstatistics and different reasonable placements of the continuum and emission-line profiles.\nSince these data are too noisy to determine covering factors and ionic column densities from\nthe optical depths of the lines, we have estimated column densities for Components 1 and 2\nfrom the EWs of the lines. As mentioned previously, nearly all of the detected lines appear\nto be saturated, so we used the EWs to calculate lower limits to their columns. Since C IV\ndoes not appear to be saturated in Component 2, we give an actual value and estimated\nerror for its column. Note that if the covering factor for C IV is significantly less than one,\nwhich seems unlikely given the depths of the other lines in this component, the quoted value\nfor the C IV column density is a lower limit.\nOur measurements are summarized in Table 1. In addition to the velocity centroids\nand EWs for Component 2, we list the corresponding Galactic values for comparison. For\nthe Galactic component, the average velocity centroid is \u221229 (\u00b120) km s\u22121 in the observed\nframe. For Component 2, the average velocity centroid is \u2212114 (\u00b121) km s\u22121 with respect\nz = 0.0012, and the FWHM of the unsaturated C IV absorption is 60 (\u00b122) km s\u22121 . If\nComponent 1 is real and outflowing with respect to z = 0.0012, we estimate a radial velocity\nand FWHM of \u2212770 (\u00b121) and 130 (\u00b130) km s\u22121 , respectively. An EW of 0.84 (\u00b10.21) \u00c5\ngives a lower limit of 2.0 (\u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 1014 cm\u22122 for the C IV column density in Component 1.\n\n5.\n\nOrigin of the Absorption\n\nIn general, the absorption components that we have detected could arise in 1) our Galaxy\n(disk or halo), 2) the ISM of NGC 4395, 3) the NLR of NGC 4395, 4) outflowing UV absorbers\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nsimilar to those found in most Seyfert 1 galaxies, or 5) X-ray absorbers, characterized by\nhigher ionization parameters than those of typical UV absorbers (Crenshaw et al. 2003a).\nWe detect a number of absorption lines from the Galaxy (Component \"G\") at an observed\nradial velocity of \u221229 km s\u22121 ; their EWs are similar to those found in other studies of\nGalactic absorption (Savage & Sembach 1994). Since the redshift of NGC 4395 is low, and\nabsorption lines from the Galactic halo can appear at radial velocities of several hundreds\nof km s\u22121 in the observed frame, we need to consider the possibility of a Galactic origin\nfor the other absorption components. We rule out a Galactic origin for Component 2, at\na radial velocity of +246 km s\u22121 in the observed frame, since at the Galactic coordinates\nfor NGC 4395 (l = 162.2o , b = 81.5o ), all of the high-velocity HI (Wakker 1991) and O VI\n(Sembach et al. 2003) clouds detected in this area of the sky have negative radial velocities\n(Wakker 1991). Component 1 is at a radial velocity \u2212410 km s\u22121 in the observed frame;\nalthough it could conceivably originate in the Galactic halo, its velocity is at least 100 km\ns\u22121 more negative than other H I and O VI halo clouds in this area of the sky (Wakker 1991;\nSembach et al. 2003). Also, we would expect to see detectable Si IV for this component if\nit were halo gas (Savage & Sembach 1994), and none is apparent (see Figure 2). Thus, it is\nlikely that these two components do not arise from the Galaxy.\nGiven an intrinsic origin for Components 1 and 2, the distinction between the above\nsources may seem somewhat ambiguous. For example, some outflowing UV absorbers are\nlikely a component of the NLR (Kraemer et al. 2001), while others have been linked to\nX-ray absorbers, such that the UV absorption lines are due to trace elements in the highly\nionized, high-column gas (Mathur et al. 1994; Kraemer et al. 2002). For this discussion,\nthe intrinsic absorption components are placed into the general category of outflowing UV\nabsorber if they are not consistent with an origin in the other categories, which have been\nwell characterized in NGC 4395 by other studies, as discussed in the following subsections.\n\n5.1.\n\nComponent 1\n\nFirst, we need to consider whether or not Component 1 is \"real,\" given the detection\nof one C IV absorption line in noisy data. On the positive side, there is an inflection in\nthe FOS spectrum at this position that appears to be distinct from the inflection caused by\nthe Galactic C IV \u03bb1548.2 line (Figure 2). On the negative side, no other lines have been\ndetected, and in particular, Ly\u03b2 appears to be absent at the radial velocity of Component 1.\nWe have been unable to devise a photoionization model that would result in an undetectable\nLy\u03b2 line, since even very highly ionized gas will have a substantial H I column. Assuming\nthe C IV absorption is real, the associated Ly\u03b2 absorption must be diluted by unabsorbed\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nUV continuum emission in the FUSE aperture, which we characterized in \u00a73.\nThe high radial velocity of Component 1 (\u2212770 km s\u22121 ) with respect to NGC 4395 rules\nout an origin in the ISM of this galaxy. As can be seen in Figures 2 and 3, the wings of\nthe narrow components of the emission lines do not extend past about \u00b1100 km s\u22121 from\nline center, so an origin in the NLR is ruled out as well. As discussed in \u00a75.3, the X-ray\nabsorbers characterized by SH2003 are too highly ionized to produce significant columns of\nC IV or lower-ionization species. Thus, Component 1 likely originates in an outflowing UV\nabsorber, which is defined by the presence of C IV absorption that is blueshifted with respect\nto the systemic velocity of the host galaxy (Crenshaw et al. 1999). The absence of Si IV and\nlower ionization lines is not a problem for this interpretation, since most UV absorbers are\ntoo highly ionized to have substantial columns of these ions (Crenshaw et al. 1999, 2003a).\nIn this case, one would expect detectable (and likely saturated) columns of O VI and H I,\nwhich are not seen at the position of Component 1 (see Figure 3). The expected O VI and\nLy\u03b2 absorption lines are likely \"hidden\" by a substantial contribution from unabsorbed UV\ncontinuum emission, as demonstrated in \u00a75.3.\n\n5.2.\n\nComponent 2\n\nIt is instructive to compare our measurements of Component 2 with those of the Galactic\ncomponent in Table 1. Since Component 2 is close to the systemic velocity (although with\na slight blueshift), it could arise from the ISM of the host galaxy. However, an origin in\nthe NLR or X-ray absorbers cannot be ruled out by the kinematics alone, since the radial\nvelocity of Component 2 (\u2212114 km s\u22121 ) is consistent with the small widths of the narrow\nemission lines, and we have no constraints on the kinematics of the X-ray absorbers.\nWe can obtain further insight by comparing the EWs of the lines from Component 2\nwith those of the Galaxy. In Table 1, the EWs of the low-ionization lines are very similar,\nwhereas those of the higher ionization lines of Si IV and C IV are about half the values\nof their Galactic counterparts. Component 2 could therefore arise from the ISM of NGC\n4395, assuming it has a smaller amount of high-ionization gas than the Galactic column\nalong this particular line of sight. Moreover, we can rule out an origin in photoionized gas,\nregardless of whether it is the NLR, UV absorbers, or X-ray absorbers. The key is the ratio\nof N(Si IV)/N(C IV) which is \u2265 1.5. Given a power-law continuum and the abundances in\n\u00a75.3, we are unable to reproduce this ratio with photoionization models covering a broad\nrange in ionization parameter and hydrogen column density. Our models predict this ratio\nshould always be \u2264 0.3, primarily due to the abundance ratio. However, N(Si IV)/N(C IV)\nratios as high as \u223c1 can be found in Galactic halo gas (Savage & Sembach 1994), which is\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nprimarily collisionally ionized.\nA final point in favor of an ISM origin is that the C II and Ly\u03b2 lines for Component 2\nin the FUSE spectrum are saturated near the zero flux level. If these lines originated solely\nin either the NLR (with an angular size <0\u2032\u2032.4, Filippenko et al. 1993) or absorbers near the\nnucleus, the extra far-UV flux in the large FUSE aperture would make them appear much\nshallower.\n\n5.3.\n\nConnection to the X-ray Absorbers\n\nWe have generated photoionization models to further explore the possibility that the\nX-ray absorbers in NGC 4395 produce observable UV absorption lines. A long (640 ks)\nASCA observation from 2000 revealed an underlying continuum characterized by a photon\nindex \u0393 \u2248 1.46, modified by a large column of gas intrinsic to NGC 4395, which SH2003\nmodeled as a two-zoned X-ray absorber. The zone closer to the nucleus was highly variable\nwhile the ionization state and total column density of the outer zone remained relatively\nconstant during their observation. Both of the components are highly ionized, and their\nobserved effect is a depression of the continuum below \u223c 3 keV, due to the combined effects\nof the bound-free edges of species such as O VII, O VIII, Ne IX, and Ne X. Notably, in their\n17 ks Chandra spectrum, Moran et al. (2004) also found evidence for complex absorption,\nalthough these data are of insufficient quality to tightly constrain the physical characteristics\nof the absorber.\nThe large column densities predicted by SH2003 suggest that detectable columns of H I\nand O VI may arise within the X-ray absorber. To calculate these column densities, we\nused the photoionization code CLOUDY90 (Ferland et al. 1998) to regenerate the constant\ncomponent from SH2003, which has a lower ionization than the variable component, and thus\nincludes a larger fraction of the lower ionization species. For their models, SH2003 assumed\nthat the X-ray continuum, with a spectral index \u03b1 = 0.46, extends to lower energies without\nturning up to meet the UV, which severely underpredicts the UV continuum. Therefore, we\nassumed a model spectral energy distribution (SED) closer to that which we derived for our\nemission-line study (Kraemer et al. 1999), with the form F \u221d \u03bd \u2212\u03b1 , where \u03b1 = 1.7 for 13.6\n\u2264 h\u03bd < 1000 eV, and \u03b1 = 0.46 for h\u03bd \u2265 1000 eV. SH2003 use the ionization parameter \u03be (in\nerg cm s\u22121 ), which is 395.3 \u00d7 U for their adopted SED, where U is the number of ionizing\nphotons per H atom. Based on our SED, we fixed the flux at 0.5 keV in order to predict\nthe same H-like and He-like O and Ne columns, and hence the same opacity near 1 keV.\nThis results in a factor of 28.5 increase in U, due to the larger number of EUV photons. So\nfor the constant component of the X-ray absorber modeled by SH2003, their value \u03be = 200\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\ncorresponds to U = 14.4.\nAssuming solar abundances, SH2003 derive a total hydrogen column density NH =\n2.45 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 , for the constant component of the absorber. However, in our emission-line\nstudy (Kraemer et al. 1999), we determined that the heavy element abundances in the NLR\nof NGC 4395 were sub-solar, with most elements \u223c 1/2 solar by number with respect to H,\nand N/H \u2248 1/6 solar. Therefore, in order to reproduce the X-ray opacity from the SH2003\nmodel, we increased the total column density to NH = 4.0 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 . We assumed that\nthe X-ray absorber is free of cosmic dust and all elements are in the gas phase.\nIn Table 2, we compare our predictions of ionic column densities from models using\nthe SH2003 SED and our revised SED. The high-ionization columns derived from the X-ray\nobservations are essentially the same. However, the H I and O VI column densities are\nfactors of \u223c17 and \u223c4 smaller, respectively, in the model that uses our more realistic SED,\ndue to the much larger flux of UV photons. Nevertheless, these columns are still quite large,\nand should be detectable in the FUSE band if the entire source of UV continuum emission is\ncovered. Our revised SED model predicts undetectable columns of C IV (3.4 \u00d7 1011 cm\u22122 )\nand other low-ionization lines, so these lines in Components 1 and 2 are not from the X-ray\nabsorbers.\nSo where are the expected H I and O VI absorption lines from the X-ray absorbers of\nSH2003? Given their column densities from our revised SED model in Table 2, we have\ngenerated simulated absorption-line profiles to determine if they would be detectable in the\nFUSE spectra. For the purpose of illustration, we assumed that the X-ray component has\nthe radial velocity and FWHM (= 60 km s\u22121 ) of Component 2. In Figure 3, we overplot\nthe simulated absorption lines for two cases: complete covering of the UV continuum and\n50% covering in the line of sight. The latter comes from assuming that the broad-line\nemission is covered and that the excess continuum flux in the FUSE is not, resulting in a\ncontinuum covering factor of 0.33 and an effective covering factor of \u223c0.5 at the Component\n2 positions. Figure 3 demonstrates that for complete covering, the Ly\u03b2 absorption from the\nX-ray absorber would be detectable, unless it is hidden in the low-ionization gas associated\nwith Component 2 or filled in by geocoronal Ly\u03b2 emission. O VI absorption at full covering\nwould be detectable at Component 2 or any other velocity, unless it is fortuitously covered by\nthe narrow O VI emission at the systemic velocity of NGC 4395, in which case it would not\nbe outflowing. For the case of 50% covering, the H I and O VI absorption could be present at\nComponent 2 or any other radial velocity, given the noise level of the FUSE spectra. Thus,\nalthough we do not detect the expected O VI and H I absorption lines, the FUSE spectra\nare not inconsistent with the parameters derived for the X-ray absorbers by SH2003.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n6.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe confirm the detection of C IV absorption in NGC 4395, and have identified a number\nof other absorption lines in new high-resolution FUSE and HST/STIS spectra. In addition to\nGalactic lines, we have identified two components that are likely to be intrinsic to NGC 4395.\nComponent 1 at \u2212770 km s\u22121 (with respect to z = 0.0012) is only detected in the C IV\n\u03bb1548.2 line. If it is real, it cannot arise in the ISM or NLR of NGC 4395 due to its\nhigh velocity. Furthermore, the X-ray absorbers characterized by SH2003 are too highly\nionized to produce a detectable C IV column. Thus, Component 1 likely originates in an\noutflowing UV absorber similar to those seen in most Seyfert 1 galaxies (Crenshaw et al.\n2003a). Observations at higher S/N are required to confirm the reality of this component, and\nidentify additional lines (e.g., N V \u03bb\u03bb1238.8, 1242.8) to characterize its physical conditions.\nThe possibility that Component 1 arises from UV absorbers close to the nucleus, for\nexample in an accretion-disk wind (e.g., Proga 2003), remains an intriguing prospect, given\nthe low luminosity of the central continuum source. Drawing on the analogy with UV\nabsorbers in normal Seyfert 1s, possible indicators of a location close to the nucleus would\nbe variability in the absorption lines or partial covering of the continuum and/or BLR. These\nmeasurements require high-resolution spectra at higher S/N than the current data.\nComponent 2 shows a broad range in ionization, and likely arises in the ISM of NGC 4395,\nsince photoionization models cannot match the observed N(Si IV)/N(C IV) ratio, and the\nC II and Ly\u03b2 absorption lines absorb all of the far-UV flux in the large (30\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 30\u2032\u2032 ) FUSE\naperture. It is interesting that this component shows a slight outflow (\u2212114 km s\u22121 ) with\nrespect to the host galaxy. This may indicate a large-scale galactic outflow driven by stellar\nwinds and/or supernovae (Veilleux et al. 2002) near the center of the galaxy.\nWe have not detected the NLR in absorption, despite its large derived covering factor\n(Kraemer et al. 1999). This could be due to the overall geometry of the NLR or to clumpiness\non a smaller scale (i.e., there is no NLR \"cloud\" in the line of sight to the continuum source).\nHowever, we note that absorption from the \"OUTER\" component of the NLR in Kraemer\net al. could be hidden in Component 2 (the other NLR components have saturated C IV\ncolumns) if it shares the same outflow velocity as the ISM. We also do not detect the expected\ncolumns of O VI and Ly\u03b2 absorption from the X-ray absorbers claimed by SH2003. This\nis likely due to a large contribution of hot stars to the far-UV flux in the FUSE aperture,\nalthough X-ray observations at higher S/N and spectral resolution would be helpful for\nconfirming the presence and properties of the X-ray absorption.\nWe thank D.

The starburst spectrum is scaled so that, when added to the power law spectrum, the\nflux corresponds to that of NGC 4395 in the 1102 \u2013 1107 \u00c5 range. This figure shows only\nthe wavelength region covered by the models. The vertical dotted lines indicate interstellar\nabsorption lines, from our Galaxy, obtained from the list of Pellerin et al. (2002). The\nmost prominent stellar lines from the list of Pellerin et al. (2002) are indicated under the\nspectrum with thick bars. A number of H2 absorption lines, not shown here, also contribute\nto absorption lines seen in this spectrum. The bottom panel of the figure shows the residuals\nfrom the subtraction of the starburst and power law spectrum from the spectrum of NGC\n4395.\nFig. 2.- Portions of the STIS echelle spectra of NGC 4395, showing the absorption lines\nin different ions. The fluxes have been smoothed with a seven-point boxcar, and are plotted\nas a function of the radial velocity (of the strongest member for each doublet), relative to\nan emission-line redshift of z = 0.0012. The kinematic components of the lines (including\ndoublets) are numbered, and strong Galactic absorption lines are labeled with \"G\".
