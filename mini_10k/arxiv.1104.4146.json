Such a reference is commonly derived\nat 10 MHz from a hydrogen maser. The development of\na cryocooled sapphire oscillator (cryoCSO) and frequency\nsynthesizer described here offers a lower noise alternative.\nCryogenic sapphire oscillators (CSO) [1]\u2013[7] have demonstrated extremely good frequency stability (characterized in\nterms of Allan deviation) at integration times in the range\n1 s to 1000 s. However, these oscillators do not operate at\nprecisely prescribed repeatable frequencies. Transferring their\nstability to precisely 10 MHz and 100 MHz presents technical\nchallenges [8]\u2013[11].\nIn this paper, we describe the design and implementation\nof a synthesizer based on an ultra-stable CSO [4], [5], [12]\ncomplemented by very low phase noise digital dividers and\na direct digital synthesizer (DDS) [13].

Synthesizer design and architecture\nWe constructed two nominally identical frequency synthesizers. Fig. 1 shows a block diagram of the synthesizer based\non a stable microwave oscillator, the cryoCSO, and a highresolution DDS phase referenced to a sub-harmonic of the\ncryoCSO signal. The output signal frequency of the cryoCSO\nis 11.201 967 189 42 GHz. This signal is not tunable and\nthe closest integer multiple of 100 MHz is 11.2 GHz. By\nfrequency shifting the cryoCSO signal with a 1.967 XXXXX\nMHz signal, generated by the DDS unit, this produces the\ncorrect frequency for integer digital frequency division. The\nfrequency shifting was performed with an image rejection\nmixer in order to suppress the spurious mixing product about 4\nMHz above the useful signal. Without this the spurious signal\nwould impair the divider operation and filtering it out would\nrequire the use of an impractically high-Q-factor microwave\nfilter. The use of the image rejection mixer is an elegant\nalternative to solve the problem.\nBy combining an X-band IQ commercial mixer with a\ncustom made \u03c0/2 phase shifter we realized an image rejection\nof about 40 dB. The signal levels are optimized to suppress the\ncarrier by about 40 dB. At the output of the image rejection\n\n\fIEEE TRANS. ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES, VOL. XX, NO.

This 200 MHz signal, down-converted from\nthe cryoCSO, is used to clock the DDS synthesizer, as well\nas a reference signal for the phase-locked loop controlling the\nfrequency of a low phase noise 100 MHz quartz oscillator,\nwhich is frequency doubled by a commercial low phase noise\nfrequency multiplier. The phase-locked loop ensures that the\nultra-high frequency stability of the cryoCSO is transferred\nto the 100 MHz quartz oscillator with only a small addition\nof noise. The frequency of the latter is further divided to 10\nMHz, but with a non-negligible noise contribution from the\ndivider.\nFurthermore the circuit provides a 1.4 GHz by dividing the\noutput signal of the mixer by 8. This signal, which is very\nclose to the hydrogen maser microwave transition, is a good\ncandidate for future very low noise synthesizers. It is worth\nnoting that the technique described here can easily be adapted\nto any of the possible microwave output frequencies from the\ncryogenic sapphire oscillator.\n\nFig. 2.

Measurement techniques\nPhase noise measurements are traditionally made using the\nanalog technique by mixing equal frequency signals 90\u25e6 out\nof phase as shown in Fig. 2(a). The baseband signal voltage\nis then sampled and Fourier analyzed by a FFT spectrum\nanalyzer, and then post-processed to extract the phase noise\ndata.\nInitially, we used the analog technique to evaluate the\nresidual phase noise of the components used to realize the\nsynthesizer. See Fig. 3. In a second phase we used a Symmetricom 5125A phase noise test set; hereafter referred to\nas the test set (see Fig. 2). The test set outputs the single\n\nwhere S\u03c6 (f ) is the power spectral density of phase fluctuations \u03c6(t) and has units rad2 /Hz. In the literature, phase noise\nis commonly reported as\nL\u03c6 (f ) =\n\n1\nS\u03c6 (f ) = 10 Log10[S\u03c6 (f )] \u2212 3 dB,\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhich has units dBc/Hz. In this paper all phase noise measurements are reported in L\u03c6 (f ) or SSB units. On a loglog plot, the term f i maps on to a straight line of slope i\n\u00d7 10 dB/decade. The value of the slope is used to identify the\nvarious noise processes commonly encountered in oscillators\n[16].\n\n\fIEEE TRANS. ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES, VOL. XX, NO.

Table I summarizes the relevant\nphase noise contributions of the active components used in the\ndesign of the synthesizer. The power spectral density of phase\nfluctuations on the DDS 2 MHz output signal is -103 dBc/Hz\nat 1 Hz offset. Since these fluctuations are superimposed on\nthe microwave carrier (when DDS signal is mixed with that of\nthe cryoCSO) their power spectral density is reduced to -144\ndBc/Hz when microwave frequency is divided to 100 MHz\nand is negligible in the total noise budget of the synthesizer.\nIts contribution is less than the phase noise of the cryoCSO\nsignal referred to 100 MHz, which is -138 dBc/Hz at 1 Hz\noffset [5]. The last column of Table I lists the relevant noise\ncontributions of each component referred to 100 MHz.\nUsing the cryoCSO output signal to drive the inputs of two\nnominally identical synthesizers we separately measured the\nrelative phase noise (see Fig 2(b)) of the 10 MHz and 100\nMHz output signals. The results are shown in Fig. 4 in curves\n(1) and (2), respectively, and specify the residual phase noise\nof a single synthesizer. Curve (3) is the phase noise of a single\n100 MHz-10 MHz digital frequency divider (model Holzworth\nHX4210, curve (4) from Fig. 3) used here. Curves (4) and (5)\nare the measurement noise floors for the test set at 10 MHz and\n100 MHz, respectively. Curve (6) indicates the expected level\nof phase noise from the cryoCSO signal when divided down\nto 100 MHz. It contributes negligibly to the phase noise of the\nsynthesizer at 100 MHz. The indicated spurs at multiples of the\n1.46 Hz of the cryocooler compressor cycle result from poor\nrejection by the measurement equipment. This was proven\nwhen the cryocooler compressor, used to cool the resonator\nin our loop oscillator, was switched off yet another was still\nrunning nearby and the same spurs were observed. Note the\npower levels of these spurs are about 20 dB lower on the 10\nMHz signal than on the 100 MHz signal. The spur near 60 kHz\nis the residual Pound modulation sideband from the cryoCSO\nloop oscillator.\nFrom Fig. 4, one can clearly see that the bandwidth of the\nPLL controlling the 100 MHz quartz oscillator is about 100\nHz. At Fourier frequencies f > 100 Hz the phase noise of the\n100 MHz output signal (curve (2)) is due to the free-running\nquartz oscillator (which is consistent with its specifications).\nAt f < 3 Hz, i.e. well within the PLL bandwidth, the\nphase noise of the 100 MHz output signal is due to intrinsic\nfluctuations of the RF mixer used in the PLL. In addition to the\nPLL mixer, the low frequency noise is also due to the intrinsic\nfluctuations in the frequency divider (division by 56) and in\nthe 200 MHz amplifier. These are sources of uncorrelated\nphase fluctuations in two synthesizers. See Table I for their\ncontributions on the 100 MHz carrier.\nThe residual phase noise of the 10 MHz signal (curve (1))\nis clearly limited by the frequency divider phase noise at\nFourier frequencies 2 \u00d7 10\u22122 Hz < f < 10 Hz. The 10\nMHz synthesizer phase noise is flicker phase dominated, and\nat Fourier frequencies f < 2 \u00d7 10\u22122 Hz it exhibits flicker\n\nSSB Residual phase noise [dBc/Hz]\n\nA.

For f < 100 Hz the shape of the the phase\nnoise spectrum of the 10 MHz signal can be explained by the\nresidual phase noise of the 100 MHz output reduced by 20\ndB (the relative frequency reduction) plus the intrinsic noise\nof the divider, but for f > 300 Hz it is not clear why we\nsee some excess noise in the 100 MHz-10 MHz frequency\ndivider. We are currently investigating the effect of changing\nthe operating temperature setpoint of the dividers and whether\nwe can explain this.\nFrom these data the SSB residual phase noise at 1 Hz offset\non the 10 MHz and 100 MHz signals is -135 dBc/Hz and -130\ndBc/Hz, respectively. The former is confirmed by the phase\nnoise measurement of a single divider as indicated by (4) in\nFig. 3. A very good 10 MHz quartz oscillator phase noise is\n-122 dBc/Hz at 1 Hz offset [20]. Our result here is 13 dB\nlower than the best quartz.\n2) Frequency stability: Using the set-up of Fig. 2(b), we\nmeasured the intrinsic frequency stability of the synthesized\n10 MHz and 100 MHz references (curves (1) and (2) of Fig. 5).\nThe measurements obtained with the test set that are shown in\nFig. 5 are for a Nyquist equivalent noise bandwidth (NEQ BW)\nof 0.5 Hz. The NEQ BW determines the minimum integration\nor averaging time (\u03c40 ) for stability measurements and is given\nby \u03c40 = 1/(2 NEQ BW). (See Ref. [15] for details.) The test\nset tabulates the Allan deviation of the fractional frequency\nfluctuations at certain integer multiples of \u03c40 . These data are\nused in the figures herein.\nCurves (3) and (4) are the measurement noise floors of the\ntest set, measured by splitting the outputs of the synthesizer\nwith a power divider. These were then subtracted from curves\n(2) and (3) and the intrinsic stability (\u03c3y (\u03c4 )) contribution for a\nsingle synthesizer at 10 MHz and 100 MHz calculated. At 1 s\nof integration, these are 9 \u00d7 10\u221215 and 2.2 \u00d7 10\u221215, for the 10\nMHz and 100 MHz outputs, respectively. The degradation in\nstability on the 10 MHz signal can be attributed to the phase\nnoise contribution of the 100 MHz-10 MHz divider itself (see\nFig. 4). If the division to 10 MHz was noiseless we would\nexpect the same fractional frequency stability on that signal\nas on the input 100 MHz signal.\nIt should be noted that the 100 MHz to 10 MHz frequency\ndivider is temperature sensitive and the intrinsic stability\nshown in Fig. 5 is the best result obtained while actively\ncontrolling the temperature of the divider with a thermistor\nand resistive patch heater a few degrees above the ambient\ntemperature.\nUsing the set-up of Fig. 2(c) we measured the stability of\nthe cryoCSO/synthesizer against our hydrogen maser at 100\nMHz. The resulting Allan deviation of the combined fractional\nfrequency fluctuations is given by curve (1) in Fig. 6. It is the\nbest result we measured over a two week period. The hydrogen\nmaser noise dominates the measurements out to about 104 s\nof averaging. The circled data indicate the cryoCSO frequency\nstability where it is assumed that the cryoCSO dominates over\nthat of the maser. To fully characterize the frequency instability\nof the synthesized signals for \u03c4 < 104 s a second cryocooled\noscillator is needed.\nFrom the previously measured frequency stability of the\ncryoCSO against a liquid helium cooled CSO [5] (curve (2)\n\n4\n\n10\n\n(2) (3)\n\n-15\n\n(1)\n\n(4)\n\n10\n\n-16\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\nIntegration time, \u03c4 [s]\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\nFig. 5.\n(Color online) The Allan deviation of the measured frequency\nstabilities for a Nyquist equivalent noise bandwidth of 0.5 Hz: curves (1)\nand (2) represents the intrinsic stability of the 10 MHz and the 100 MHz\nsynthesizers, and curves (3) and (4) are the measurement noise floors at 10\nMHz and 100 MHz respectively.\n\nin Fig. 6) it is possible to estimate the expected short term\nand very long term stability of a single cryoCSO (curve (3)\nin Fig. 6). This estimate is based on the assumption that for\ntimes \u03c4 < 100 s both oscillators are equal in performance and\nat times \u03c4 \u2265 105 s the frequency stability of the cryoCSO\nis that of curve (1), from the comparison of the cryoCSO\nwith our maser. This must be the case else we would see\nthe long term stability (no frequency drift removed) similar\nto that of curve (2) for \u03c4 > 103 s. For \u03c4 > 100 s the liquid\nhelium cooled CSO frequency stability is worse than that of\nthe cryoCSO. Hence we are able to calculate the total noise\ncontribution from the cryoCSO and a single synthesizer for\nintegration times \u03c4 < 100 s, where we have reliable data.\nIn order to calculate the expected stability of the synthesized signals with the cryoCSO the frequency stability of the\ncryoCSO (curve (3) of Fig. 6) was added to the intrinsic\nstability of the synthesizer (curves (1) and (2) of Fig. 5) at\n10 MHz and 100 MHz, respectively. The results are shown in\nFig. 7 where they are compared with the frequency stability\nof our maser (curve (1) for \u03c4 < 105 s) and with that of\na high performance maser (curve (4)). Curves (2) and (3)\nare the frequency stabilities for the 10 MHz and 100 MHz\ncryoCSO/synthesizers, respectively.\nThis calculated data was interpolated to the measured\ncomparison data between the hydrogen maser and the cryoCSO/synthesizer (curve (1) in both Figs 6 and 7) for \u03c4 \u2265 105\nwhere the noise contribution is assumed to be largely due to\nthe cryoCSO. As a result we were able to curve fit to the\ndata of curves (2) and (3), in Fig. 7, resulting in flicker floors\nestimated to be about 4 \u00d7 10\u221216 (10 MHz) and 3 \u00d7 10\u221216 (100\nMHz) at integration times around 1000 s. These flicker floors\ncannot be well specified due to insufficient data.\nHowever, since we only have one cryocooled sapphire\noscillator we were not able to directly measure its stability for\n60 s < \u03c4 < 104 s. A second cryocooled oscillator is necessary\n\n\f5\n\ncryoCSO vs Kvarz maser 100 MHz (1)\ncryoCSO vs liq. helium CSO 11.2 GHz (2)\nsingle cryoCSO (3)\ncryoCSO vs Kvarz maser 11.2 GHz (4)\n\ny\n\nAllan deviation, \u03c3 (\u03c4)\n\nIEEE TRANS.

These fits are valid for \u03c4 > 105 s.\nThe long term frequency stability at both 10 MHz and 100\nMHz signals should converge due to the long term stability of\nthe cryoCSO. However beyond 104 s the cryoCSO stability\nis largely determined by the environment; temperature and\npressure changes. Also there is an uncertainty about the\nfrequency stability of the hydrogen maser, so the only way\nto truly establish this performance is with at least one more\ncryocooled sapphire oscillator.\n\n\fIEEE TRANS. ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES, VOL. XX, NO. X, DECEMBER 2011\n\n6\n\nThe cryoCSO signal frequency is subject to drift due to\nambient pressure and temperature changes in the lab, though\nthe lab temperature is stable to \u00b10.1\u25e6 C. These changes\ntranslate into temperature and pressure changes within the\ncryostat. The design of the cryostat has a mixed liquid-heliumgas space. For a schematic of the cryostat see Fig. 1 of Ref.\n[5]. This means the region where the cryocooler condenser\nconstantly reliquefies a small quantity of helium gas in a closed\nsystem. It has been found that best operating condition in this\nhelium gas space is where the pressure is maintained as low\nas possible.\nFigure 7 (curve (1)) shows a comparison at 100 MHz of\nthe cryoCSO/synthesizer compared to our hydrogen maser.\nThis data was taken over a period of about 2 weeks after\nthe cryoCSO had been continuously operating for about 9\nmonths. It has been observed that the data exhibit a long term\ntrend of decreasing frequency. This measurement represents\nthe quietest data segment in terms of low frequency drift that\nwe have taken to date. The solid line (labeled (5)) in Fig.\n6 is a fit used to determine the drift rate of 8 \u00d7 10\u221216 /day\nassuming drift dominates over random walk of frequency. As\nthe cryoCSO was improved on, a 4 K radiation shield reduced\nthermal gradients [5] and reduced frequency drift but the origin\nof the remaining frequency drift is unknown.\nThe normal operating pressure inside the helium gas space\nis about 46 kPa. A steady state of helium gas being reliquefied\nmaintains this. If power is shut off to the compressor, for\nexample, in the event of a power failure, the pressure in this\nregion will begin to rise. This was observed, when, due to\na maintenance issue, the power to the whole lab was shut\noff for about 20 minutes. After the power was restored the\npressure stabilized to its normal condition within an hour and\nthe oscillator started automatically and remained functioning.\nSubsequently we measured the time evolution of the cryoCSO frequency after this event. This was measured by\ndown-converting the 11.202 GHz signal of the cryoCSO to\napproximately 2 MHz with a 11.200 GHz signal produced\nfrom a higher order harmonic of a Step-Recovery diode driven\nwith a doubled 100 MHz output of our hydrogen maser. A\nsimilar technique was used in Ref. [9]. The 2 MHz output\nfrom the mixer was filtered and directly counted with an\nAgilent 53132A counter with a 10 s gate time. This method\nwas necessary to obtain a time series of the evolution of the\nbeat between the cryoCSO and the microwave reference signal\nfrom our maser. See Fig. 8 for the fractional frequency offset\nfrom the moment the cryoCSO oscillator started up again. The\ndrift rate is negative and decreasing. The best fit to 7 days of\ndata is described by,\n\u2206f\n= a(e\u2212t/t0 \u2212 1),\nf\n\n(5)\n\nwhere a = (5.79\u00b10.02)\u00d710\u221214 and t0 = 4.44\u00b10.02 days. By\nthe 7th day Eq. (5) represents a decreasing fractional frequency\ndrift in the cryoCSO frequency of 2.7 \u00d7 10\u221215 /day. Since\nwe observed the decreasing exponential frequency drift for\nmany months from the initial start-up, after cooling from room\ntemperature, it cannot be attributed to a change in pressure in\n\nFractional frequency\n\nB.

The cause of this long term exponential decrease is not\nknown as yet.\nThe frequency stability calculated from the time series\ndata is shown in Fig. 6 (curve (4)) with error bars. The\nexponential frequency drift (Eq. (5)) was removed before the\nAllan deviation was calculated. The multiplication process via\nthe step-recovery diode used to generate the 11.2 GHz from the\n100 MHz maser signal and amplification adds some noise, and\nalso there seems to be an unknown temperature dependence\nthere as well. Nevertheless, the stability calculated from the\n7 days of data of Fig. 8 shows very good reproducability\nof the cryoCSO performance even after a 20 minute power\ninterruption.\nIV.

The results are listed for 345 GHz in Table\nII along with the oscillator stability at fixed integration times\nand compared to that calculated from a very high performance\nmaser. A typical value of the T-4 Science maser [19] has been\nassumed. The frequency stability for that maser is shown as\ncurve (4) in Fig. 7.\n1/2\nSimilarly the coherence function C(T )2\nwas calculated using the stability data for this hydrogen maser (with\nthe same stability at both 10 MHz and 100 MHz) where the\nsame assumption was made as above. The resulting coherence\n1/2\nfunction is then compared by plotting the ratio of C(T )2\nderived from either the 10 MHz or 100 MHz synthesizer with\nthat when the maser is used. The results are shown in Fig.\n9, and show that the calculated coherence function is greater\nwhen using the 100 MHz reference due to its better short term\nstability.\nThe references synthesized from the cryoCSO are significantly more frequency stable than those from a hydrogen\nmaser, especially the 100 MHz output. The latter offers\nimprovements above 200% in the value of the coherence\n1/2\nfunction C(T )2\nat observing frequencies of 345 GHz\nat coherence times near 104 s, assuming that the frequency\nreference is the limitation. It is apparent from Fig. 9 that at\nobserving frequencies less than 100 GHz there is only a small\nadvantage in using the cryoCSO. It must be said that where\nthe decoherence effects of the atmosphere can be avoided,\nor compensated for, there is a clear advantage in integrating\nthe signals for an hour or more. This is where the cryoCSO\noffers a big advantage over the hydrogen maser, especially for\nmillimeter wave VLBI.\nV. C ONCLUSION\n\nthe case and the expression must be cut off at some point. In\nour case it was sufficient to use n = 3 at 345 GHz and n = 4\nat 230 GHz and 100 GHz for calculations with all frequency\nstandards. See Ref. [18] for further details.\nFor a particular standard at a given observing frequency, the\ncoherence function has the range 0 to 1. C(T ) is proportional\n1/2\nto the fringe amplitude [21] and when C(T )2\n= 1 there is\nno loss of coherence. The coherence time is approximately the\n1/2\ntime for which the coherence function C(T )2\napproaches\n1.\nFrom a qualitative point of view the coherence time is\nshorter at higher observing frequencies. Therefore the stability\nof the local reference will impact more strongly at higher\nfrequencies over the shorter averaging times. Hence for millimeter wave observations the stability of the local oscillator\nbecomes very important assuming the seeing conditions (the\natmosphere) is not the limitation.\nUsing the analytical expressions, Eqs (3) and (4), obtained\nfrom fits to our measured stability \u03c3y (\u03c4 ) data, in Fig. 7, we\n\nTwo nominally identical frequency synthesizers based on\nlow phase noise digital dividers and a direct digital synthesizer\nhave been constructed and their performance evaluated. The\nreference signals at 10 MHz and 100 MHz were synthesized\nfrom a cryocooled sapphire oscillator and their phase noise and\nstability measured. The synthesizer residual single sideband\nphase noise, at 1 Hz offset, on 10 MHz and 100 MHz signals,\nrespectively, were measured to be -135 dBc/Hz and -130\ndBc/Hz. Their intrinsic frequency stability contributions, on\nthe 10 MHz and 100 MHz signals, respectively, were measured\nas \u03c3y = 9 \u00d7 10\u221215 and \u03c3y = 2.2 \u00d7 10\u221215 , at 1 s integration\ntime. As such the fractional frequency noise on 100 MHz\noutput, at short integration times, is only about a factor of\n2 greater than that of the cryocooled oscillator itself. The\nestimated total frequency stabilities of the new references are\nsignificantly better than those for the same output frequencies\nfrom a very high performance hydrogen maser.\nFrom these measurements, we calculated the coherence\nfunction, a figure of merit, for millimeter wave VLBI radio\n\n\fIEEE TRANS.

The references synthesized from the cryocooled\nsapphire oscillator offer improvements in terms of the\ncoherence function of the order of 200% or more, where one\nis able to average the signal for several hours, at observing\nfrequencies well above 100 GHz. The 100 MHz output\nproduces a better result than the 10 MHz output, as might be\nexpected. The cryocooled sapphire oscillator has the potential\nto replace the hydrogen maser as the low noise frequency\nstable reference for millimeter wave VLBI radio astronomy.\n\nVI.
