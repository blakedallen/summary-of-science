The Triangulum Spiral Galaxy Messier 33 offers unique insights into the building of\na galactic disk. We identify spectacular arcs of intermediate age (0.6 Gyr \u2212 2 Gyr) stars in the\nlow-metallicity outer disk. The northern arc spans \u223c120 degrees in azimuth and up to 5 arcmin\nin width. The arcs are located 2-3 disk scale lengths from the galaxy centre (where 1 disk scale\nlength is equivalent to 0.1 degrees in the V-band) and lie precisely where there is a warp in the HI\nprofile of M33. Warps and infall are inextricably linked (Binney, 1992). We present spectroscopy\nof candidate stars in the outer northern arc, secured using the Keck I telescope in Hawaii. The\ntarget stars have estimated visual magnitudes as faint as V\u223c 25m. Absorption bands of CN\nare seen in all spectra reported in this review talk, confirming their carbon star status. Also\npresented are PAH emissivity radial profiles generated from IRAC observations of M33 using the\nSpitzer Space Telescope. A dramatic change of phase in the m=2 Fourier component is detected\nat the domain of the arcs. M33 serves as an excellent example how the disks of spiral galaxies\nin our Universe are built: as dynamically open systems, growing from the inward, outward.\nKeywords. galaxies: evolution \u2013 galaxies: spiral \u2013 galaxies: individual (M33 = NGC598)\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nBlock et al.\n\n1. Introduction\nSpiral galaxies appear to be dynamically open systems, whose disks are still forming at the current epoch and which continue to accrete mass. Isolated spiral galaxies\n(non-accreting systems) cannot reproduce the observed distribution of gravitational bar\ntorques at all (see Figure 1 in Block et. al. 2002). In that study, it was argued that\ndisk masses should double every 10 billion years. The most likely source for the origin\nof accreted gas could be the reservoirs of gas observed outside nearly all spiral disks\n(Sancisi 1983). Keres et al. (2005) carefully discuss accretion in terms of filaments in the\ncosmic web. An extremely important point is that accreting systems in gas need not show\nany signs of accretion in stars, such as the presence of tidal tails, stellar loops or close\ncompanions. Disks of galaxies appear to form from the inside out (Block et al. 2002).\nRelative to the inner regions of spiral galaxies, the mean ages of the outer regions are\nknown to be somewhat younger and more metal-poor (Bell and de Jong 2000). We can\ntherefore expect the contribution from intermediate-age (0.6 Gyr \u2212 2 Gyr) stars to be\nstronger in these outer regions, and the near-IR surface brightness of the outer disk will\nbe preferentially enhanced by the presence of thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch\n(TP\u2013AGB) stars. Although the average number of carbon stars per intermediate age\ncluster in the Magellanic clouds is only about 2.5 (Persson et al. 1983), they radiate such\nan enormous amount of light in the near-infrared that they contribute about 50 percent\nof the bolometric luminosity of the entire cluster.\nThere is no better place to start examining the accretion of gas in the outer domains of\nspiral disks than in our Local Group, and we focus our attention here on the Triangulum\nSpiral Galaxy M33. The history of the Andromeda Galaxy M31 is discussed elsewhere\n(Block et al. 2006). If accretion of gas is indeed taking place in M33, and if its disk\nis growing from the inside outwards, then one obvious tell-tale signature would be the\npresence of a red intermediate age population of carbon stars in its outer disk.\nIn an earlier study (Block et al. 2004), we presented near-infrared images of M33 from\na deep subsample of 2MASS, in which individual stars were unresolved. The deep 2MASS\nimages revealed remarkable arcs of red stars in the outer disk; the northern arc subtends\n120\u25e6 in azimuth angle and \u223c 5\u2032 in width (see Figure 1). The northern arc is dominant\nalthough a very faint southern counterpart arc, forming a partial ring, can also be seen.\nThe arcs lie at a radius of 2-3 disk scale lengths (in V, the disk scale length is 0.1 degree;\nFerguson et al. 2006). Of course we are not claiming that carbon stars lie only in the\ntwo outer arcs, but we do claim that a combination of increased number density, perhaps\naided by an increase in the IR integrated-light contribution of carbon stars relative to\nthe underlying stellar population due to a metallicity gradient, makes them stand out\nin the infrared. That there is an increase in number density at the appropriate radius is\nconfirmed by Rowe et al. (2005).\nFourier analysis of the light distribution shows that the dominant m = 2 peak corresponds to the giant arcs. The pitch angle of the dominant m = 2 structure is \u223c 58\ndegrees. It is these outer arcs, not the inner two-armed structure, which dominate the\nm = 2 Fourier spectra at the NIR.\n\n2. Observations\nTable 1 lists the magnitudes and colors of 7 candidate targets in the outer northern\narc. In deriving the absolute magnitudes in Table 1, we assume a distance modulus to\nM33 of 24.64m, corresponding to a linear distance of 840 kpc (Freedman et al. 1991).\nNoting that E(B\u2212V) = 0.3 \u00b1 0.1 mag (Wilson 1991), and that the K-band extinction is\n\n\fInsights from the Triangulum Spiral M33\n\n3\n\nFigure 1. A partial ring of very red stars is seen in this JHKs image of M33, secured from\na special set of 2MASS observations wherein the integration time was increased by a factor of\nsix. The ring is seen to full advantage with a simple ellipsoid model subtracted. The northern\nplume or arc spans up to 5\u2032 in width and is located at a radius of 2 to 3 disk scale lengths. An\nellipsoidal swath is selected to pass through the arcs. North is up and East to the left.\nTable 1.

The positions of the seven stars listed in Table 1 are indicated by plus signs; the stars\nlie in the northern swath of carbon bearing stars identified photometrically in an earlier study\n(Block et al. 2004). Spectra of these stars (see Fig. 3) were secured using the Keck I telescope\nin Hawaii. Also observed (but with its twin sister telescope, Keck II) are two stars which lie\n0.5 degrees away from the centre of M33, in an area identified by a white circle. These outlying\nstars are representative of a very red family identified in near-infrared imaging with the Hale\n5m reflector at Mount Palomar.\n\nObservations of M33 were also made using all four bands of the Infrared Array Camera\n(IRAC) on 2005 January 21 as part of a Spitzer Guaranteed Time Observing Program\n(Program ID 5) conducted by Spitzer Science Working Group member R. D. Gehrz. The\nIRAC instrument (Fazio et al. 2004) is composed of four detectors which operate at 3.6,\n4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 \u03bcm. All four detector arrays are 256x256 pixels in size with mean pixel\nscales of 1.221, 1.213, 1.222, and 1.220\u2032\u2032pixel\u22121 respectively.\n\n3. Discussion and Conclusions\nCarbon stars show a plethora of molecular spectral features, including the C2 Swan\nbands and the CN bands. All stars in Table 1 as well as those imaged within the white\ncircle (Figure 2) are spectroscopically confirmed to be carbon stars.\nFigure 4 shows a PAH emissitivity radial profile in M33, generated from a scaled\nnon-stellar IRAC 8\u03bcm - 3.6\u03bcm image. We find a dramatic change of phase in the PAH\ndistribution at precisely the same radius where Corbelli and Schneider (1997) find a warp\nin HI. Galactic warps and infall of gas are inextricably linked, as reviewed by Binney\n(1992).\nThe Keck spectra offers unique insight into how the disks of one of our closest spiral\ngalaxies, M33, has evolved with time: it continues to grow by accretion of low-metallicity\ngas from the inside, outwards. The implications of the presence of carbon stars in the\nouter disk of M33 immediately beckons the question of a possible ubiquity of such an\n\n\fInsights from the Triangulum Spiral M33\n\n5\n\nFigure 3.

The presence\nof the hugely dominant CN bands shortward of 7000\u00c5 and 8000\u00c5 and longward of 9000\u00c5 are\nindicated by tick marks and unambiguously reveal their C-star status.\n\nintermediate age population in the outer domains of other spiral disks. At hand is the potential to exploit our technique of identifying thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch\ncarbon stars in the outer domains of more distant spirals on the basis of their nearinfrared colours.\nAcknowledgements\nThe Anglo American Cosmic Dust Laboratory is funded by the Anglo American Chairman's Fund.

The topmost panel shows a PAH emissitivity radial profile. In the middle panel is\nshown the amplitude of the Fourier m=2 mode as a function of radius. The local peak at r = 14\u2032\ncoincides with the inner radial limit of the arcs. The phase of the m=2 component is presented\nin the lower panel. We see a dramatic change of phase in the PAH distribution at precisely the\nsame radius r = 18\u2032 where Corbelli and Schneider (1997) find a warp in HI.\nBinney, J. Ann. Rev. Astron.
