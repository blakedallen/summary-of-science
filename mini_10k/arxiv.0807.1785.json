One of the possible ways\nto generalize the black hole potential is to consider a modified version of the N = 4 superconformal\nmultiplet where its auxiliary components acquire non-zero constant values. We explicitly write down\nthe corresponding modified black hole potential.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nRecently, the supersymmetric one dimensional theories appeared in the two different but related fourdimensional systems. Firstly, in [1] it was established connection between black holes and conformal\nmechanics [2]. Geodesic motion of a particle near the horizon of an extreme Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole\nwas shown to be related to the relativistic version of the De Alfaro\u2013Fubini\u2013Furlan conformal mechanics.\nLater on it was demonstrated [3] that this new version of relativistic conformal mechanics is just a known\none rewritten in another coordinate system. Secondly, one-dimensional supersymmetric theories appear\nwhen considering a geodesic motion in the black hole background in the presence of N = 2, d = 4 vector\nsupermultiplets [4, 5]. The corresponding one dimensional action is fully specified by the metric of the\nscalars which describes a special K\u00e4hler geometry [6], and the effective black hole potential VBH , which\ndepends only on the scalars and electric and magnetic charges. The resulting system has been intensively\nstudied also within attractor mechanism framework [7].\nIn both these approaches the fermionic sectors are (almost) completely ignored. One reason for\nneglecting fermions is that most of needed features are really encoded in the bosonic sector of these\ntheories. Another reason is that the dimensional reduction is not straightforward, especially in the\nfermionic sector. That is why in the present paper we attempt to consider both these one-dimensional\ntheories with all fermionic terms included within one-dimensional supersymmetry framework.\nThe main topics we are going to consider include the following ones:\n\u2022 We demonstrate how the effective black hole potential, with proper electric qA and magnetic pA\ncharges, arises in a theory with n-copies of self-coupled N = 8, d = 1 vector supermultiplets\n(Section 2). The important new peculiarities are the appearance of the charges as a result of a\nspecific solution of the basic constraints on the auxiliary components of the vector supermultiplets.\n\u2022 We analyze the structure of the action in terms of N = 4, d = 1 supermultiplets (Section 3).\nThis is a necessary step to couple the vector supermultiplets to N = 4, d = 1 conformal supermultiplet. We split N = 8 vector supermultiplet in two N = 4 ones; the equivalence of these\nrepresentations was first shown in [8]. Each of these N = 4 supermultiplets possesses one physical\nboson and four fermions. The superfield constraints, describing the N = 4 supermultiplets, contain\ndifferential equation on two auxiliary components. Namely the solution to these equations introduces p-charges in the black hole potential. The q-charges appear after dualization of the other\nauxiliary components.\n\u2022 We consider the N = 4, d = 1 superconformal symmetry (Section 4). The most important here\nis different conformal properties of the two N = 4, d = 1 supermultiplets forming N = 8, d = 1\nvector one. It turns out that with respect to the superconformal transformations, one of them is a\nvector superfield, while the other is a scalar one. This completely fixes the action in terms of N = 4\nsuperfields. In the paper we deal only with the case of SU (1, 1|2) superconformal group.\n\u2022 Finally, we pass to the components and presented the general action with all fermionic terms\nincluded (Section 5). The explicit form of the supercharges and the Hamiltonian is also given in\nthis Section.\n\u2022 We also propose a possible generalization to the case where the superconformal multiplet itself\ncontains non vanishing coupling constant. The modified bosonic black hole potential is explicitly\nwritten (Section 6).\n\n2\n\nN=8 vector supermultiplet and BH potential\n\nIn this Section we demonstrate how the bosonic sector of the most general action for n-vector N = 8, d = 1\nsupermultiplets reproduces the main part of the BH action [4, 5] (with the supergravity sector being\nswitched off). The constructed action contains the effective \"black hole potential\" initially introduced\nin [5]. We also explain how the electric and magnetic charges, entering this potential, appear within\none-dimensional supersymmetry formalism.\nThe heart of the N = 2, d = 4 SYM theory is formed by a vector supermultiplet, which describes\nspin-1 particles, accompanied by complex scalar fields and doublets of spinor fields. The geometry of the\n\n1\n\n\fscalar fields is restricted to be a special K\u00e4hler one [6]. The restriction that the metric be defined by a\nholomorphic function is rather crucial for the consideration.\nIt is known for a long time that the standard reduction from the N = 2, d = 4 SYM to d = 1 gives\nrise to a N = 8 supersymmetric theory with five bosonic fields, i.e., the (5, 8, 3) supermultiplet1 [9, 10].\nOf course, after such a reduction the geometry of the bosonic sector is be completely different from the\nspecial K\u00e4hler one. Fortunately, there is another version of the dimensional reduction from N = 2, d = 4\nSYM to one dimension [11, 12]. This reduction is performed in terms of the field strength, rather than\nin terms of a prepotential [9, 10]. In such an approach only a complex scalar of the vector multiplet\nbecomes a physical boson in d = 1, while the rest of the bosonic components turns into auxiliary fields.\nThus, we end up with the (2, 8, 6) supermultiplet.\nThe most general N = 8 supersymmetric action for n-many vector supermultiplets can be written as\nan integral over N = 4 subspace of R1|8 superspace\nZ\nZ\n\u0001\nS = \u2212 dtd2 \u03b82 d2 \u03b82 F Z A \u2212 dtd2 \u03b81 d2 \u03b81 F(Z A ), A = 1, . . . , n,\n(2.1)\nwhere F (Z A ) and F (Z A ) are arbitrary holomorphic functions of the vector supermultiplets Z A and Z A ,\nrespectively. All relevant notations and definitions are given in appendix A.\nThis action is notable for the fact that its bosonic part contains the well-known effective black hole\npotential [5]\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012 \u0013\nZ\nh\ni\n\u0001 M + N M \u22121 N N M \u22121\n1\np\nA  \u0307B\np q\nSbos = dt MAB \u017c z\u0304 \u2212 V (p, q, z, z\u0304) , V =\n(2.2)\n\u22121\n\u22121\nM\nN\nM\nq\n16\n\nwith the standard notations explained below, see formula (2.11). The appearance of the constants pA\nand qA is closely related to the proper treatment of the constraints on the auxiliary components of the\nvector supermultiplet. To clarify this point we integrate over the Grassmann variables in the action (2.1)\nand take its bosonic part:\n\u0014\u0010\nZ\n\u0011\n\u0011\u0015\n1 \u0010\n(2.3)\nFAB X A Y B + F AB X A Y B .\nSbos = dt FAB + F AB \u017c A z\u0304 \u0307 B +\n16\nThe functions FAB (z) and F AB (z\u0304) are nothing but a bosonic limit of the corresponding second derivatives of the prepotential F (Z) (see appendix A). The auxiliary components X A and Y A of the vector\nsupermultiplet are not completely independent, but subjected to the constraints (A.4):\n\u0011\n\u2202 \u0010 A\n(2.4)\nX \u2212 Y A = 0,\n\u2202t\nwhile the rest four auxiliary bosonic components Y a\u03b1 are expressed, as a consequence of their equations\nof motion, only in terms of the fermions and, therefore, they do not contribute to the bosonic part of the\naction.\nTo deal with the constraints (2.4) let us firstly split them as follow\n\u0001\n\u2202\nRe X A \u2212 Y A = 0,\n\u2202t\n\u0001\n\u2202\nIm X A + Y A = 0.\n\u2202t\n\n(2.5)\n(2.6)\n\nThen one may check that under the N = 8 supersymmetry, Re X A and Re Y A transform as a total time\nderivative:\n\u2202\n(fermions) .\n(2.7)\n\u03b4Re X A = \u03b4Re Y A \u223c\n\u2202t\nSo, we may solve (2.5) as follows\nRe X A = Re Y A = \u2202t \u03a5A\n(2.8)\nwithout breaking the N = 8 supersymmetry. Let us stress, that only due to the transformation properties (2.7) the right hand side in (2.8) can be represented as a time derivative of a new bosonic field \u03a5A .\n1 We use the notation (n, N, N \u2212 n), in order to describe a supermultiplet with n physical bosons, N fermions and N \u2212 n\nauxiliary bosons.\n\n2\n\n\fConcerning constraints (2.6), we just solve them as\n\u0001\nIm X A + Y A = pA = const,\n\n(2.9)\n\nwhere the constants pA are identified as magnetic charges corresponding to the black hole [5]. Substituting\nall these into the action (2.3) we get\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\n\u0011 1\n\u0010\n1\nSbos = dt MAB \u017c A z\u0304 \u0307 B + MAB \u03a5\u0307A \u03a5\u0307B \u2212 pA pB + cA cB + NAB pA \u03a5\u0307B ,\n(2.10)\n16\n8\nwhere\n\nMAB = FAB + F AB ,\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nNAB = i FAB \u2212 F AB ,\n\n\u0001\ncA = Im X A \u2212 Y A .\n\n(2.11)\n\nAgain, the auxiliary components cA do not contribute to the bosonic part of the action and, consequently,\nmight be neglected.\nThe coordinates \u03a5A are cyclic; the corresponding conserved quantities are identified with the electric\ncharges qA :\n\u0011\n1\n1\u0010\n(2.12)\nMAB \u03a5\u0307B + NAB pB = \u2212 qA = const.\nP \u03a5A =\n8\n8\nPerforming the Rauth transform with respect to the variable \u03a5A we get the action (2.2) with V (p, q, z, z\u0304)\nbeing exactly the effective black hole potential of Ref [5]. The full supersymmetric form of this action is\ngiven in the forthcoming Sections.\nDespite the complete coincidence of the derived potential V (p, q, z, z\u0304) with that one of Ref [5], the\nactions do not coincide \u2013 it is easy to see that in the action (2.2) it is missing one degree of freedom,\nnamely that one corresponding to a dilaton. To make this field enter the game in a supersymmetric\nmanner, one should introduce the interaction of the vector supermultiplet with an N = 4 superconformal\nmultiplet, which contains a dilaton among its components. Before doing this, let us first describe the\nvector supermultiplet in N = 4 setup, which is used to describe the superconformal multiplet.\n\n3\n\nThe vector supermultiplet in N = 4 superspace\n\nThe simplest way to introduce the interaction with the N = 4 conformal supermultiplet is to use N = 4\nsuperfields. So, let us discuss how the N = 8 vector supermultiplet is formulated in N = 4 superspace.\nAs a first step, we identify the SU (2) indices a and \u03b1 and introduce the following set of covariant\nderivatives constructed from Dia , \u2207i\u03b1 (A.1):\n\u0001\n1\nDa = \u221a D1a + i\u22072a , Da =\n2\n\u0001\n1\na\n\u2207 = \u221a D1a \u2212 i\u22072a , \u2207a =\n2\n\n\u0001\n1\n\u221a D2a + i\u22071a ,\n2\n\u0001\n1\n\u221a D2a \u2212 i\u22071a .\n2\n\nThen we introduce the real and imaginary parts of the vector multiplet Z, Z:\n\u0011\n\u0011\n1\u0010\ni\u0010\nU=\nZ +Z , \u03a6=\u2212\nZ \u2212Z .\n2\n2\n\n(3.1)\n\n(3.2)\n\nIn terms of these variables the constraints (A.2a) have the following form\nDa U + i\u2207a \u03a6 = 0, \u2207a U + iDa \u03a6 = 0,\n\nD a U \u2212 i\u2207a \u03a6 = 0, \u2207a U \u2212 iDa \u03a6 = 0.\n\n(3.3)\n\nThe role of these constraints is quite clear: they express \u2207a and \u2207a derivatives of the N = 8 superfields U\nand \u03a6 in terms of Da and Db ones. Therefore, all components of the vector supermultiplets are contained\nin the N = 4 superfields u and \u03c6 depending on \u03b8a \u2212 i\u03b8\u0304a and \u03b8\u0304a \u2212 i\u03b8a only:\nu=U\n\n\u03b8=i\u03b8\u0304,\u03b8\u0304=i\u03b8\n\n,\n\n\u03c6=\u03a6\n\n\u03b8=i\u03b8\u0304,\u03b8\u0304=i\u03b8\n\n.\n\n(3.4)\n\nThe second set of the constraints (A.2b), being rewritten in the new basis, produces the irreducibility\nconstraints on the N = 4 superfields u and \u03c6:\ni\n\u0010\n\u0011\nh\n(a) ,\nDa Db + Db Da \u03c6 = 0\n(b).\n(3.5)\nDa , Da u = 0\n3\n\n\fThese constraints define the standard and twisted N = 4 supermultiplets, each containing one physical\nboson and four fermions [13, 14]. Let us note that from (3.5a) it immediately follows that\n\u2202 2\n\u2202\nD u = D2 u = 0,\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n\n(3.6)\n\nwhere D2 = Da Da and D2 = Da Da . These equations are just N = 4 variant of constraints (A.4).\nFinally, using (3.3) one may rewrite the action (2.1) as an integral over the N = 4 superspace\nZ\nh\n\u0001\n\u0001i\nS = \u2212 dtd2 \u03b8d2 \u03b8\u0304 F uA + i\u03c6A + F uA \u2212 i\u03c6A .\n(3.7)\n\nLast thing which has to be clarified is the appearance of the electric and magnetic charges within N = 4\nformalism. It is rather easy to check that the equation (2.9) results in the conditions\nD2 uA = ipA ,\n\nD2 uA = \u2212ipA ,\n\n(3.8)\n\nwhile the N = 4 analog of the condition (2.8) reads\n\u0011\n\u0010\ni D2 \u03c6A \u2212 D2 \u03c6A = \u2202t \u03a5A .\n\n(3.9)\n\nThus we have all the ingredients to reproduce the effective black hole action in terms of N = 4 superfields.\nIn the next Section we will consider N = 4 superconformal multiplet and will couple it to the black hole\naction.\nTo close this Section let us note that the equations (3.8) and (3.9) explicitly break the evident U (1)\nsymmetry realized as\n\u03b4Da = i\u03b1Da , \u03b4Da = \u2212i\u03b1Da .\n(3.10)\nInstead of this symmetry another U (1) invariance appears in the system\n\u03b4Da = \u03b2D a ,\n\n\u03b4Da = \u2212\u03b2Da .\n\n(3.11)\n\nIt is quite easy to check that the constraints (3.5), (3.8) and (3.9) are invariant with respect to this U (1)\nsymmetry. This fact will be important in the Section 5 when introducing fermionic and auxiliary components with the proper charges with respect to this U (1) group.\n\n4\n\nMaintaining N=4 superconformal symmetry\n\nIn this Section we are going to couple the effective black hole action (3.7) to the N = 4 superconformal\nmultiplet. In one dimension the most general superconformal group is D(2, 1; \u03b1) one [15]. Here we\nrestrict our consideration by the special case with \u03b1 = \u22121 which corresponds to SU (1, 1|2) symmetry.\nThis superconformal group has natural realization in the N = 4, d = 1 superspace [13]\n1\n1\n\u03b4t = E \u2212 \u03b8a Da E \u2212 \u03b8\u0304a Da E,\n2\n2\n\ni\n\u03b4\u03b8a = \u2212 Da E,\n2\n\ni\n\u03b4 \u03b8\u0304 = \u2212 Da E,\n2\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere the superfunction E(t, \u03b8, \u03b8\u0304) collects all SU (1, 1|2) parameters:\n\nHere\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1\nE = f (t) \u2212 2i \u03b5\u03b8\u0304 \u2212 \u03b8\u03b5\u0304 + \u03b8a \u03b8\u0304b B(ab) + 2 \u03b5\u0307\u03b8\u0304 + \u03b8\u03b5\u0304 \u0307 (\u03b8\u03b8\u0304) + (\u03b8\u03b8\u0304)2 f \u0308.\n2\nf = a + bt + ct2 ,\n\n\u03b5a = \u01eba + t\u03b7 a .\n\n(4.2)\n\n(4.3)\n\nThe bosonic parameters a, b, c and B(ab) correspond to translations, dilatations, conformal boosts and\nrigid SU (2) rotations, while fermionic parameters \u01eba and \u03b7 a correspond to Poincar\u00e9 and conformal supersymmetries, respectively.\nIt is important that by definition the function E obey conditions\ni\nh\n\u2202t3 E = \u2202t2 Da E = \u2202t D(a Db) E = 0.\n(4.4)\nD2 E = D2 E = Da , Da E = 0,\n4\n\n\fAs usually, we consider the systems where the conformal supersymmetry is spontaneously broken. Therefore, to maintain SU (1, 1|2) invariance, one has to introduce the super-dilaton - N = 4, d = 1 superfield \u0169\nwhich transforms as follows\n\u03b4\u0169 = \u2202t E.\n(4.5)\nIt is known for a long time [13] that the super-dilaton has to be further constrained by the conditions\nh\ni\nD2 Y = D2 Y = Da , Da Y = 0,\nY = e\u0169 .\n(4.6)\n\nThese constraints are fully compatible with the transformation properties (4.1), (4.5).\nThe invariant superspace measure is defined as\n\u25b3s = dtd2 \u03b8d2 \u03b8\u0304 Y,\n\n(4.7)\n\nwhile the invariant action for superconformal multiplet Y is unambiguously restored to be\nZ\nSg = \u2212 dtd2 \u03b8d2 \u03b8\u0304 Y log Y.\nClearly enough, the invariant action for the matter fields A can be constructed as\nZ\nSmatter = \u2212 dtd2 \u03b8d2 \u03b8\u0304 Y G(A),\n\n(4.8)\n\n(4.9)\n\nprovided the superfields A are scalars under the superconformal transformations. In black hole action (3.7)\nwe have two sets of the N = 4 superfields: uA and \u03c6A restricted by the constraints (3.5). Keeping in the\nmind the transformation properties of the covariant spinor derivatives Da , Da under SU (1, 1|2)\n\u03b4Da = \u2212\n\n\u0011\ni\u0010 a\nD Db E Db ,\n2\n\n\u03b4Da = \u2212\n\n\u0011\ni\u0010\nDa Db E Db\n2\n\n(4.10)\n\none may check that the constraints (3.5) are invariant under the N = 4 superconformal group if the\nsuperfields uA , \u03c6A have the following transformation properties\n\u03b4uA = \u2202t E uA ,\n\n\u03b4\u03c6A = 0.\n\n(4.11)\n\nSo, the superfields \u03c6A are scalars under superconformal transformations, while uA are vectors. The\nsimplest way to construct scalars from the superfields uA is to consider the combinations (uA Y \u22121 ).\nTherefore, the superconformally invariant black hole action reads\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012 A\n\u0012 A\nZ\nu\nu\n(4.12)\n+ i\u03c6A + F\n\u2212 i\u03c6A ,\nS = \u2212 dtd2 \u03b8d2 \u03b8\u0304 Y log Y + F\nY\nY\nwhere the N = 4 superfields are constrained by the conditions (3.5),(3.8) and (4.6).\nIn the next Section we will consider this action on the component level and with the fields \u03a5A\nintroduced and then dualized into the charges qA .\nIt is worth mentioning that there is another possibility to construct scalar superfields from uA ones.\nIndeed, the ratio of any two superfields uA , for example the superfields uA /u1 , are perfectly scalars with\nrespect to the superconformal transformations. So, an arbitrary function of these superfields is a good\ncandidate to be an invariant Lagrangian density. The full analysis of a such situation is out of the scope\nof the present paper and will be considered elsewhere.\n\n5\n\nField content of the supersymmetric black hole action\n\nTo find the components action one has to integrate over the Grassmann variables in the superfield\naction (4.12), remove the auxiliary components through their equations of motion and perform the dualization in a way discussed in the previous sections. Before presenting the component action let us define\n\n5\n\n\fthe physical bosonic and fermionic components as\nuA\n+ i\u03c6A ,\nYr\nY\n\u03b7 aA =\n(iDa \u2212 Da )z A ,\n2\nr\nY\nA\n(iDa \u2212 Da )z\u0304 A ,\n\u03b7\u0304a =\n2\nzA =\n\nuA\n\u2212 i\u03c6A ,\nYr\nY\n\u03c7aA =\n(iDa \u2212 Da )z\u0304 A ,\n2\nr\nY\nA\n(iDa \u2212 Da )z A ,\n\u03c7\u0304a =\n2\nz\u0304 A =\n\ny=Y\n1\n\u03c1a = q\n(iDa \u2212 Da )Y,\n2Y\n\n(5.1)\n\n1\n(iDa \u2212 Da )Y,\n\u03c1\u0304a = q\n2Y\n\nwhere in the right hand sides it is supposed to be taken only the first components in their Grassmann decompositions.

The dots stand for four-fermionic\nterms; they do not depend on the charges pA , qA and since their explicit form is not too illuminated,\nthey are written down only in the Hamiltonian.\nThe explicit form of the on-shell action (5.2) together with the N = 4 supersymmetry transformations (4.5), (4.11) provides all ingredients needed to construct the supercharges and Hamiltonian.

Thus, coupling of the vector\nsupermultiplet to the superconformal one goes through the \"diagonal\" centerless N = 4 superalgebra\nspanned by the combinations Qa \u2212 S\u0304 a in the full N = 8 supersymmetry existing in the case on n-copies\nof N = 8, d = 1 vector supermultiplets.\n\n7\n\n\f6\n\nBlack hole potential modification\n\nFrom the point of view of the superconformal group SU (1, 1|2), the superconformal multiplet is defined\nas an exponential of the dilaton superfield \u0169. The covariance with respect to the superconformal transformations fixes the irreducibility constraints to be (4.6). Really speaking, these constraints may be slightly\nmodified as\nDa Da Y = \u2212im,\n[Da , Da ]Y = 0.\n(6.1)\nDa Da Y = im,\nThis seems to be the only possible modification of the constraints supporting superconformal symmetry\nand U (1) symmetry (3.11).\nThe supersymmetric action preserves its previous form, but due to the presence of the constant m,\nits component form gets modified (we consider here only its bosonic part)\n\u0014\nZ\n\u1e8f 2\nm2\nm\nS = dt yMAB \u017c A z\u0304 \u0307 B +\n\u2212\n\u2212 (Y A \u2212 Y A )(FA \u2212 F A ) + yMAB cA cB\ny\n4y\n4\n!\n\u0012 A\n\u0013\nX B + im Re z B\n1\nX \u2212 im Re z A\nB\nA\n\u2212 yFAB\n+ iY\n+ iY\n(6.2)\n4\ny\ny\n!#\n\u0013\n\u0012 A\nX B + im Re z B\n1\nX \u2212 im Re z A\n\u2212 iY A\n\u2212 iY B\n\u2212 yF AB\n.\n4\ny\ny\nIt is obvious that on-shell in the pure bosonic limit the auxiliary fields cA vanish. The dualization goes\nthe same way as it is described in the previous section: one should declare the auxiliary field X A be a\nconstant (again, due to U (1) arguing, it has to be an imaginary one), while the field Y A be split on the\nreal and imaginary parts\nX A = ipA ,\n\nX A = \u2212ipA ,\n\nY A = Re Y A + iIm Y A .\n\nThe later field has to be dualized Im Y A = \u2202t \u03a5A , while the former \u2013 eliminated as it usually happens to\nauxiliary fields.

The detailed discussion of such a modification will be considered elsewhere.\n\nConclusion\nIn this paper we analyzed a system constructed by coupling of n-copies of N = 8, d = 1 vector supermultiplets to N = 4 superconformal one. The N = 4 superconformal symmetry uniquely fixes the\nresulting action. We demonstrated that the electric and magnetic charges, presenting in the \"effective\nblack hole\" action [5] appear as a result of solving the constraints on the auxiliary components of the\nvector supermultiplets. We also present the full component action with all fermionic terms included as\nwell as the supercharges and Hamiltonian. The one of the possible ways to generalize the black hole\npotential is to consider modification of the N = 4 superconformal multiplet by assigning non vanishing\nconstant values to its auxiliary fields. We explicitly wrote down the corresponding modified black hole\npotential.\nIn some sense this paper can be considered as a continuation of the studies initiated in [1]. Keeping\nin mind that the \"new conformal mechanics\" constructed in [1] is nothing but standard one [2] rewritten\nin terms of other coordinates [3], one may hope that the constructed system describes the dynamics\nof a particle near the horizon of an extreme Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole when the interaction with\n8\n\n\felectromagnetic fields is turned on. The dimensional reduction from d = 4 to d = 1 is not straightforward\nin this case. Therefore, the fully one-dimensional consideration we presented in this paper could be useful.\nAnother very interesting area of applications of the system considered is a possible relation to a\none-dimensional geodesic motion in a black hole background in the presence of N = 2, d = 4 vector\nsupermultiplets [5]. The main problem in this direction is that our bosonic action is different from those\none in [5] by a factor. Of course, this difference appears because we insist on the N = 4 superconformal\nsymmetry which is absent in the action of [5]. Nevertheless, it sounds reasonable that our action could\nappear in some limit (near BH horizon?). If it happens, the full action with all fermionic terms included\ncould help to analyze the attractor mechanism, etc. Related question is whether it is possible to keep\nall N = 8 supersymmetry unbroken? To construct such an action one has to introduce the interaction\nwith N = 8 superconformal multiplet. Unfortunately, up to now such a multiplet, which admits a nontrivial potential term in the action, is known to have only on-shell description [13]. But this is not the\nproblem provided we are working in the Hamiltonian formalism. We are planning to consider such a\nsystem elsewhere.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to Sergio Ferrara, Alessio Marrani and Armen Yeranyan for clarifying discussions.\nS.K. and A.Su. thank Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati, INFN, where this work was completed for\nkind hospitality and financial support.
