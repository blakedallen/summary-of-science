INTRODUCTION\nThe nature of the vortex phase diagram in High-Temperature Superconductors (HTS) has been the subject of\nintense investigation in the 15 years since their discovery. Due to the combination of their high critical\ntemperature, short coherence length and large anisotropy, HTS have a greater dependence on thermal fluctuations\nthan that of conventional superconductors, resulting in vortex dynamics that are largely different and a more\ncomplex H-T phase diagram structure.\nThe large anisotropy in superconductor properties is a result of the strongly layered structure of oxide HTS.\nCombined with the short coherence lengths, a de-coupling transition from 3-dimensional (3D) vortex lines to 2D\nvortex pancakes is predicted1. The transition in vortex dimensionality results from a loss of the inter-layer vortex\npancake coupling due to the influence of thermal and magnetic fluctuations on the Josephson and electromagnetic\ncoupling. Evidence of this transition has been experimentally observed in YBa2Cu3Ox,2 (Y123) and\nBi2Sr2CaCu2Ox3,4 (Bi2212) systems. A thermally induced crossover has been observed in Ag-sheathed\nBi2Sr2Ca2Cu3Ox (Ag/Bi2223) tapes via dc flux transformer measurements5 and magnetic relaxation\nmeasurements.6\nThe controlled creation of pinning centres allowed by heavy-ion irradiation techniques provides a suitable\nmethod for probing the vortex dynamics in a systematic manner.7 There is mounting evidence that parallel\ncolumnar defects created across the layers of anisotropic HTS increase the inter-layer vortex coherence, promoting\na 3D line-like behaviour, by suppressing the effects of thermal fluctuations on the pancake positions.8 This effect\nhas been observed in heavy-ion irradiation studies on Bi2212 single crystals9 and thin films,3 Tl2Ba2CaCu2Ox\n(Tl2212) thin films10 and BSCCO tapes,11 using diverse methods such as Josephson plasma resonance,9 resistive\ndissipation10 and Jc(\u03b8) scaling.11 The studies of transport Jc(\u03b8) scaling with B\u22a5,11 the component of applied field\nperpendicular to the tape ab-plane, identified an increase in the 3D line-like vortex state in both Ag/Bi2223 and\nAg/Bi2212 tapes with parallel columnar defects.\nThe introduction of splay (dispersion) in the columnar track directions was proposed12 to improve pinning\nfurther, by suppressing the relaxation via double-kink formation that is the dominant type of vortex excitation in\nthe parallel track configuration. Studies in Y12313, however, demonstrated that sufficiently large splay angles\nwould instead promote vortex motion and stimulate creep. This behaviour of large splay was explained by the\naction of vortex cutting,14,15 whereby the c-axis coherence cannot be maintained, reducing the pinning action to\nthat of point defects.15\nFurther, comparisons of the uranium-fission method on Y123, Bi2212 and Bi2223 samples revealed that\npinning enhancements were greater in the more highly anisotropic BSCCO superconductors, particularly Bi2223.16\nAt the time, the authors were unable to provide any structural evidence to explain the differences. Krusin-Elbaum\net al.17 investigated the effects of randomly splayed fission-induced pinning in Hg cuprates with different degrees\nof anisotropy. The authors demonstrated that uniformly splayed defects provide much stronger improvement of\n\n\fvortex pinning in superconductors with a high anisotropy and suggested that this results from a re-scaling of the\npinning distribution by the anisotropy.\nBased on the findings in Ref. 17, we would expect that randomly splayed columnar pinning tracks in Bi2223\nwould produce similar results to fission-damage in the most anisotropic of Hg cuprates. That is, we expect firstly a\nstrong suppression of the flux creep rate (and hence a large increase in the activation energy barriers to flux creep)\nand secondly promotion of the c-axis vortex coherence in comparison to virgin Bi2223.\nEnhancements in the inter-layer vortex coherence by heavy-ion irradiation induced parallel columnar defects\nhave been reported in Ag/Bi2223 tapes.11 The effect of random splay on the vortex coherence in Bi2223, however,\nhas not been experimentally resolved.\nWe use a uranium-fission technique to introduce randomly splayed, quasi-columnar pinning defects within the\nsuperconducting matrix of highly c-axis oriented Ag/Bi2223 tapes. The effective activation energy Ueff of the tapes\nbefore and after uranium fission was determined via dynamic magnetisation relaxation, and the vortex\ndimensionality was deduced from the behaviour of Ueff as a function of current density.\nIn the course of this investigation, the necessity for the introduction of a temperature scaling term into the\ncalculation of Ueff(J) was made apparent. The best method for determining the functional form of this scaling term\nis empirically from the data, rather than from a form determined a priori. However, a conflicting result was\ndetermined in the absence of any temperature scaling of the effective activation energy. The outcomes of the\nanalysis of the data without temperature scaling would imply a reduction in the c-axis vortex coherence after\nintroduction of randomly splayed pinning, in direct contrast to the expectations based on the results of Ref. 17. The\npresence of a temperature scaling term provides a more physically reasonable value for the flux hop velocity.\nCombined with agreement from transport voltage \u2013 current measurements, we therefore conclude that the\ntemperature-scaled analysis indicating promotion of the vortex coherence by the splayed defects is the correct\ninterpretation.\nA dimensional crossover from a 3D elastic creep regime to 2D plastic creep was observed in the virgin tape at an\napplied magnetic field \u03bc0Hcr \u2248 0.37 T with an associated change in the flux hop velocity and the temperature\ndependence of the effective activation energy. After introduction of the fission-fragment damage, the crossover was\nshifted to \u03bc0Hcr \u2248 0.65 T, indicating an enhancement of the c-axis vortex correlation due to the introduced splayed\ncolumnar defects.\nII. ANALYSIS THEORY\nMeasurements of the magnetisation relaxation provide a useful means of investigating the vortex dynamics. The\neffective activation energy, Ueff, for thermally activated flux hopping out of a pinning centre can be examined over\na wide range of current densities by analysing the relaxation at various temperatures and applied fields. Theories of\nflux dynamics, such as collective flux creep18 or vortex-glass theories,19 predict the behaviour of Ueff as a function\nof current density, so that the observed current dependence can be related to the dominant vortex dynamics.\nThere are a number of different methods available for analysis of the relaxation data.20 One of the most widely\nused, and the method employed here, is Maley's method.21 Dynamic and static relaxation measurements have been\nshown equivalent,22 so we applied Maley's method after adjustment for dynamic magnetic relaxation data.22 In\nconsidering thermally activated flux motion, the effective activation energy required for a flux hop out of a pinning\ncentre can be described by\n\uf8ee \uf8ebH\uf8f6\n\uf8f9\n\uf8eb 2a\nU eff (J,H,T ) = k B T \uf8efln\uf8ec \uf8f7 + C \uf8fa; C = ln\uf8ec\uf8ec\nH\n\uf8ed d\n\uf8f0 \uf8ed \uf8f8\n\uf8fb\n\u0001\n\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7 , (1)\n\uf8f8\n\nwhere a is the flux hop distance, \u03bd0 is an attempt frequency, d is a characteristic sample dimension, typically the\naverage grain diameter and H is the applied field sweep rate in T/s. C is a fitting parameter which is adjusted to\nprovide a smooth, continuous Ueff(J) curve, and is assumed to be temperature independent at T \u00ab Tc (or only weakly\ntemperature dependent at higher T). This assumption stems from the reasoning that C does not have a strong\ndependence on a and \u03bd0, both temperature dependent terms, as they are only logarithmic arguments in C.23 The\nresulting data points can then be fitted using the interpolation formula,24\n\u0002\n\n\uf8f9\nU (H ) \uf8ee J (T )\n(J , H ,T ) = c \uf8ef\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec c \uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7 \u2212 1\uf8fa ,\n\uf8ef\uf8f0\uf8ed J \uf8f8\n\uf8fa\uf8fb\n\u0004\n\nU eff\n\n(2)\n\n\u0003\n\nwhere Uc, Jc(T) and \u03bc are fitting parameters, and \u03bc is dependent on the flux dynamics. For J \u00ab Jc(T), Eq. (2)\nreduces to the form predicted by the vortex-glass and collective creep theories,18,19 U \u221d [Jc(T)/J]\u03bc, with \u03bc > 0.\n\n\fThe size and variation of C with applied field required for a smooth fit of the data over a large temperature\nrange was perceived to be physically unreasonable23. To overcome this, the introduction of a temperature scaling\nterm was suggested, to separate the explicit temperature dependence of Ueff from the current dependence. This\nmodified Maley's method can be verified by considering Ueff(J,H,T) as a separable function25 of applied field,\ntemperature and current density. Then Ueff(J,H,T) can be expressed as\nU eff (J,H,T ) = U 0U (T )U (H )U (J ) ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere U0 is a characteristic pinning potential, and U(T), U(H) and U(J) describe the temperature, field and current\ndependencies of Ueff(J,H,T), respectively. It follows that\nU eff (J,H,T0 ) = U 0U (H )U (J ) =\n\nU eff (J,H,T )\nU (T )\n\n(4)\n\nis the effective activation energy scaled to a characteristic temperature T0, and U(H), U(J) describe the field and\ncurrent dependencies at T0, respectively.\nFrom the definition of Jc = J at Ueff = 0 and with Ueff(J,H,T0) as defined in (4), Eq. (2) then becomes\nU eff (J , H ,T0 ) =\n\n\u03bc\n\uf8f9\nU c \uf8ee\uf8eb J c (T0 ) \uf8f6\n\uf8ef\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\uf8f7 \u2212 1\uf8fa .\n\uf8ef\uf8f0\uf8ed J \uf8f8\n\uf8fa\uf8fb\n\n(5)\n\nTo determine U(T), two different approaches have been taken. The first, as followed in Ref. 23, takes known\ntemperature-scaling forms determined theoretically and applies them directly to the data. Ueff(J,H,T) is divided by\nthe scaling term and values for C are chosen to provide the best continuity of Ueff(J,H,T0) over the entire\ntemperature range. The scaling term can be changed or adjusted until a reasonable value of C is found to provide a\nsmooth continuous fit.\nTinkham,26 by considering the temperature dependencies of Hc and \u03bb in the Ginzburg-Landau relations, found a\ntemperature scaling factor of the form\n\n( )\n\nU (T ) = 1-t 2 1-t 4\n\n1/ 2\n\n/t ; t =\n\nT\n,\nTc\n\n(6)\n\nwhich can be approximated to\nU (T ) \u2248 (1 \u2212 t )3 2 ,\n\n(7)\n\nvalid over a wide range of temperatures above t \u2248 1\u20442. More specifically, this U(T) reflects the temperature\ndependence of the depairing current density Jc0, which is Jc at H = 0 and without any reductions by thermal\nfluctuations, and is thus by definition not reduced to zero above Tirr.26 The form of Eq. (6) also predicts a form\n\n(\n\n)\n\nU (T ) \u2248 1 \u2212 t 2 ,\n\n(8)\n\nat low temperatures, t \u00ab 1\u20442. Temperature scaling functions of the form (7) and (8) were used in the literature to\nobtain smooth fit for U(J) in modified Maley's method. 23, 27\nThe second approach involves determining U(T) empirically from the experimental data.27 The value of C is\nchosen to provide continuity of Ueff at the lowest isotherm data sets (highest J), where C is expected to be the least\ntemperature dependent. Each successive isotherm is adjusted by a multiplicative scaling factor G that produces a\ncontinuous fit to the adjacent lower isotherms. Once all isotherms have been adjusted, the resulting curve should be\na continuous Ueff(J,H,T0) curve. By curve fitting G against T, the functional form can be determined, generally in\nthe form27\nG (T ) =\n\n(1 \u2212 t )\n\nm n\n\na\n\n= U (T )\u22121 .\n\n(9)\n\nMeasurement of the current-voltage characteristics over a range of applied fields at constant temperature\n\n\fprovides a crosscheck for the field dependence of the sign of \u03bc.

Thus, the parameter \u03bc may be related to the curvature of the lnE vs lnJ\ncurves. A change in the sign of the curvature of lnE \u2013 lnJ as a function of magnetic field can therefore be taken as\nan indication of a similar change in the sign of \u03bc, independent of any temperature scaling issues. Measurement of\nthe current-voltage characteristics in various applied fields at a constant temperature provides a crosscheck for the\nfield dependence of the sign of \u03bc.\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS\nA mono-core Ag/Bi2223 tape doped with small quantities of 235U was fabricated using the powder-in-tube\nprocess.29 The HTS precursor powder was doped with c = 0.6 wt% of UO2.2H2O. A highly enriched uranium\nmixture containing an isotopic ratio of approximately 98% 235U was used. Tc was determined from ac susceptibility\nmeasurements to be 108K, and Jc0 from transport measurements was obtained as 22.4 kAcm-2.\nA 3 cm length of processed tape was irradiated by highly moderated thermal neutrons at the HIFAR reactor of\nthe Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, to a fluence \u03a6 n = 2.25 x 1019 m-2. A second 3 cm\nlength of tape was kept without irradiation as a control sample. The irradiation procedure resulted in a 1K\nreduction in Tc, and Jc0 was reduced to 18.1 kAcm-2. The tapes are expressed in the form (c, \u03a6 n).\nThe thermal neutron fluence induces fission of the 235U, resulting in two high-energy heavy-ion fissionfragments with a mean mass of 115 amu and mean energy of about 85 MeV. The ionisation energy loss per unit\nlength of the fission-fragments, dE/dx, varies along the fragment track, only occasionally exceeding the threshold\nvalue for amorphous track formation as a result of the stochastic nature of the process. The fission-fragment\ndamage thus forms quasi-columnar defect tracks in a string-of-beads effect, with an average radius of 5 nm and\naverage length of 10 \u03bcm per fission-fragment. The total angular distribution of the energetic fission-fragments is\nrandom, owing to the statistical nature of the fission process, so that the end result of the doping and irradiation\nprocedure is the creation of randomly oriented, quasi-columnar amorphous defect tracks.\ndc magnetic measurements were performed in an Oxford Instruments vibrating sample magnetometer on two\nsample pieces cut from the tapes measuring 4 x 3 x 0.2 mm3. After zero-field cooling the sample to the\nmeasurement temperature, hysteresis loops were recorded in fields \u03bc0H = \u00b11 T, applied perpendicular to the tape\nplane. The hysteresis loops were measured at sweep rates of field of 0.05, 0.1, 0.25. 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0 T/min and\nwithin a temperature range 15 \u2013 70 K. The current density was estimated from the irreversible magnetisation Mirr,\nhalf the difference between the magnetisation on the increasing and decreasing branches of the loops.\nTransport voltage \u2013 current (V \u2013 I) characteristics were measured using a standard four-probe dc method on the\n2 cm lengths of tape. The samples were immersed in liquid nitrogen to reduce heating effects. Magnetic fields up\nto 0.6T were applied perpendicular to the tape plane. Voltages were pre-amplified by a Keithley 1801 nanovolt\npreamplifier and measured on a Keithley 2001 digital multimeter.\nIV. RESULTS\nApplying the standard Maley' s method to our experimental data, it was difficult to find a single value ofC that\ncould provide smooth continuity of Ueff over the entire temperature range. To line up isotherms in the low\ntemperature range, values of C ~ 15 were used. However, this left the higher temperature isotherms extremely\nmisaligned. To compromise in the quality of fit between the high and low temperature ranges, values of C ~ 40\nwere needed at low applied magnetic fields, and C ~ 30 at higher fields.\nFrom (1), 2v0/d \u2248 eC, where v0 \u2248 a\u03bd0 is the flux hop velocity.30 From the literature, values of C between 10 and\n20 and v0 ~ 10 ms-1 are expected.31, 32 A value of C = 15 results in an estimate of v0/d = 1.6 x 106 s-1. Assuming d =\n35 \u03bcm (average core thickness for the tapes), this result gives a reasonable estimate for the flux hop velocity: v0 \u2248\n55 ms-1, in reasonable agreement with expectations from the literature. In comparison, the values of C = 30 and 40\nobserved here result in v0/d = 5.3 x 1012 and 1.2 x 1017 s-1, respectively, which are both many orders of magnitude\nlarger than physically viable.\nHence, the above experimentally derived values for C of 30 and 40 are unacceptably large. These would also\nresult in an unexpectedly strong field dependence of C. Consequently, we consider the standard Maley' s method to\nyield physically unreasonable values for C.23\nThe results obtained after analysis with the modified form of Maley's method are shown in the Tables I, II a nd\nIII for both samples and at applied fields of 0.15, 0.3, 0.5, 0.65 and 0.8 T. The analysis is limited to fields below\n\n\fthe irreversibility field Hirr(T). For the nonirradiated tape, Hirr < 0.8 T over a large portion of the temperature\nrange, so there is no analysis possible for the nonirradiated tape at this applied field. Similarly, the analysis is\nlimited to fields well above the field of full penetration Hp, which lies above 0.15 T in the irradiated sample for T <\n30 K. Thus we do not include the isotherms below 30 K at this applied field for the irradiated tape.33\nTable I contains the results found by application of the first scaling approach, utilising the temperature scaling\nform of Eq. (7). Since the continuity fit for each isotherm was determined by eye, values of C are only accurate to\n\u00b11. A continuous Ueff(J,H,T0) was found for each applied field in both samples, as illustrated in Fig. 1, but the\nisotherms did not always fit in a smooth manner, and in some cases, the slopes of neighbouring isotherms were\nslightly offset. To compensate for the misalignment in one set of isotherms C can be altered, but usually with the\neffect of bringing others out of line. Changing the form of U(T) was also tried, but with similar problems. The\nresult is the best compromise as determined by eye. Compared for an equivalent applied field and at a constant\ncurrent density J, the effective activation energies after introduction of fission-fragment damage are approximately\n50% larger than those of the nonirradiated tapes, over the entire field and current density range.\nThe slopes of the isotherms in U(J) are much better aligned if a discrete temperature scaling factor G is chosen\nfor each isotherm, so that a smooth U(J) is obtained. With this method, it was possible to obtain a very smooth\nU(J) curve, with the slopes of each of the neighbouring isothermal U(J) matching closely (Fig. 2). Such smooth\ntransitions between the isothermal U(J) were not obtainable with a predetermined form of U(T). Consequently, we\nwill focus our discussion on the data obtained by the empirical scaling approach.\nThe data set of G determined at each temperature in this fitting procedure can be plotted as a function of\ntemperature, where an empirical expression for the functional form of U(T) can be fit to the data set. Figure 3\ndisplays the empirically obtained temperature scaling set G(T), along with a curve fit to the form in Eq. (9). The\nfitting parameters resulting from the curve fit are shown in Table II, accurate to approximately \u00b13%.\nThe empirically determined temperature scaling forms for both tapes fall into two broad groups. At low applied\nfields, the scaling forms are very close to the theoretically determined form U(T) \u2248 (1-t)3/2 (Eq. (7)) within the\nspecified uncertainty. Only the form of U(T) at \u03bc0H = 0.3 T for the irradiated tape is difficult to account for, with n\n= -1.70 \u00b1 0.05 being larger than the expected n = -1.50.\nThere is a significant change in the functional form at \u03bc0H \u2265 0.5 T in the nonirradiated tape and similarly in\nfields \u03bc0H \u2265 0.65 T in the irradiated tape. At these fields, U(T) shows a remarkably different behaviour than at low\nfields, following a form similar to that of Eq. (8). Changes in U(T) are thus more obvious when the temperature\nscaling term is derived directly from the data, rather than applying a term determined a priori.\nIt is generally found in the literature that a predetermined U(T) is often chosen in the form of either Eq. (7) or\n(8).23,27 Our empirically determined U(T) for both tapes can also be fitted with these two equations. However, we\nwould like to stress that the nature of the temperature scaling function used for the fitting of the data obtained from\nmagnetic relaxation is determined by the type of vortex dynamics. It depends not only on fundamental pinning\nrelated parameters23 such as \u03bb and Hc, but also on the dimensionality of the vortices, type of pinning centers,\ninterlayer vortex coupling and many other factors. Therefore, Eqs. (7) and (8), which are derived by taking into\naccount only the temperature dependence of \u03bb and Hc,26 are not necessarily indicative of a fundamental description\nof any temperature dependencies of the magnetic relaxation data. Additionally, the successful fit of Eqs (7) and (8)\nto our empirically obtained U(T) might only result from the fitting procedure being performed over a range of\ntemperatures that is too narrow to discern reliably the accuracy of the fitting. Consequently, the apparently good fit\nof our G(T) with these equations is merely coincidental and no conclusions based on their derivation can be applied\nto our data.\nTable III contains the results for Ueff obtained through the empirical temperature scaling approach. For the\nirradiated tape, C is not significantly different to that determined using an a priori temperature scaling, listed in\nTable I, for applied fields \u03bc0H \u2264 0.5 T. C is increased by only slightly more than the margin of error (\u00b11) for the\nnonirradiated tape in applied fields \u03bc0H = 0.15 and 0.3 T. Additionally, the values determined by the empirical\nscaling approach for these two applied fields are very similar in both tapes, where the difference may still be due to\nthe fitting accuracy. It indicates that a\u03bd0/d is very similar in both tapes at these applied fields.\nIn applied fields \u03bc0H \u2265 0.5 T in the nonirradiated tape and \u03bc0H \u2265 0.65 T in the irradiated tape, however, C was\ndetermined to be significantly larger than in the lower applied fields, and also larger in comparison to the\ntheoretically determined temperature scaling approach. This observed increase in C, which is correlated with the\nchange in the form of U(T), represents a change in the v0 as the applied field is increased. The increase to C = 19\nresults in a\u03bd0/d less than two orders of magnitude larger than the low field estimate, which is still an acceptable\nestimate.\nFigure 4 displays the resulting Ueff(J,H,T0) curves obtained using the empiric temperature scaling. A comparison\nat both extremes of the applied field analysed (0.65 and 0.15 T) reveals that, after introduction of fission-fragment\ndamage, the effective activation energies are increased to approximately twice those of the control tape without\nfission-induced defects. This difference is at a maximum of 2.3 times for J close to zero, and reduces as J\n\n\fapproaches Jc, with a minimum change in Ueff of approximately 1.5 times at the upper limit of J measured.\nThe difference in Ueff is much more pronounced at an applied field of 0.5 T, reaching almost 15 times the\nnonirradiated Ueff as J \u2192 0. This is a result of the different limits of Ueff(J,H,T0) as J approaches zero that are\nobserved in different applied fields and which can be better perceived by re-plotting Fig. 4 in a linear-log format,\nFig. 5. In low applied fields, Ueff diverges as J \u2192 0, as predicted by the collective creep and vortex-glass theories\nfor an elastic FLL.18, 19 This is distinguished from the high field behaviour, where Ueff can be seen to approach a\nconstant value U0 as J \u2192 0, characteristic of creep by plastic shear deformations.34\nThe crossover from elastic to plastic creep is in fact correlated with the empirically determined form of U(T). A\ndiverging Ueff is found for all applied fields where U(T) is approximately described by (1-t)3/2, whereas a form of\n(1-t2) defines a Ueff(J,H,T0) curve that approaches a constant value for J \u2192 0. In the nonirradiated tape, the\ncrossover from divergent to non-divergent behaviour is found to occur at \u03bc0H = 0.5 T, but it occurs at a higher\napplied field, \u03bc0H = 0.65 T, in the irradiated tape. Therefore, at an applied field of 0.5 T, the current dependencies\nof the two tapes differ, and hence the diverging activation energy of the irradiated tape deviates to a large degree\nfrom the activation energy of the nonirradiated tape as J \u2192 0.\nV. DISCUSSION\nThe current density dependence can be better characterised by fitting the experimental Ueff(J,H,T0) curves with\nthe functional form of Eq. (5) and examining the resulting values of the fitting parameter \u03bc, given in the Tables I,\nII and III for each different approach to the temperature scaling and plotted against applied field in Fig. 6. It can be\nseen that the resulting \u03bc values are a decreasing function of applied field, with an apparent crossover from positive\nto negative \u03bc values at a field Hcr. Using the empirically determined U(T), this crossover occurs at \u03bc0Hcr \u2248 0.37 T\nfor the nonirradiated tape and approximately 0.65 T after irradiation. Hcr is slightly higher when scaling is\nperformed with a predetermined U(T), but the transition of \u03bc is evident regardless of the particular technique used\nfor determining U(T).\nAs noted above, changes in the divergence of Ueff, and hence the vortex dynamics, are more obvious when the\ntemperature scaling term is derived directly from the data, rather than by applying a term a priori. The crossover to\nnegative \u03bc is then observed to occur simultaneously with the changes in the divergence of Ueff, as well as in the\nform of U(T) and the value of C. These features therefore appear to be correlated.\nThe shift from positive to negative \u03bc is understood to be indicative of a transition from 3D elastic creep to a 2D\nplastic creep regime.35 The change in sign of \u03bc observed thus suggests a 3D-2D transition in the system at about\n0.37 T in the nonirradiated tape and \u03bc0H ~ 0.65 T after irradiation. In anisotropic HTS such as Bi2223, it has been\nestablished that there is a dimensional crossover in the flux lattice, when either magnetic fields or thermal\nfluctuations destroy the Josephson coupling between vortices in adjacent layers.1 At low temperatures, the\ntheoretical criterion for this field induced 3D to 2D transition is1\n\u03bc0Hcr \u221d \u03a6 0/\u03b32s2,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03a6 0 is the flux quantum, \u03b3 the anisotropy ratio, and s the layer spacing. Due to a lack of exact data on the\nanisotropy ratio in Ag/Bi2223 samples, the theoretical crossover field can only be estimated. However, Blatter et\nal.36 estimate \u03bc0Hcr = 0.36 T. The value of \u03bc0Hcr \u2248 0.37 T observed here from the magnetisation measurements is\nremarkably close to this estimate.\nThe substantial changes observed in U(T) at \u03bc0Hcr may be consistent with a de-coupling of the pancake vortices\nin neighbouring layers. Clem37 demonstrated that the inter-layer magnetic coupling between pancake vortices, in\nthe limit of zero Josephson coupling, could be destroyed by thermal excitations even at quite low temperatures. The\ndimensional crossover requires a large reduction in the Josephson coupling, so that the limit of zero Josephson\ncoupling may apply in the 2D state, above \u03bc0Hcr. Below \u03bc0Hcr, where the Josephson coupling is strong, the\ndependence on thermal excitations is not as strong at such low temperatures as for the 2D state. Thus, at low\ntemperatures, the dependence of the vortex dynamics on thermal excitations will be greater in the 2D regime than\nin the 3D regime.\nSimilarly, the change in C observed at \u03bc0Hcr may be consistent with a pancake de-coupling transition. The\nviscosity of vortex motion depends on the pinning and interaction of the flux vortices.36 In a crossover to 2D\npancakes, the effectiveness of pinning centres on vortices in adjacent layers is reduced.38 The weak interlayer\nvortex interaction also allows vortices in one layer to slip past pinned vortices in adjacent layers. This leads to a\nreduction in the viscosity of the vortex pancake motion. The reduced viscosity allows a faster hop velocity, which\nwill lead to a commensurate increase in C.\nThe change in the divergent behaviour of Ueff as J \u2192 0 may also be explained from a dimensional crossover. In\nthe 2D state, the diverging activation energy barriers predicted for the 3D elastic FLL are not expected.38 Above\nHcr, rather, creep is dominated by the plastic shear of edge dislocations, which have a finite barrier against creep\n\n\feven as J \u2192 0.36 Thus the behaviour of Ueff(J,H,T0) as J \u2192 0 above and below the crossover field, Fig. 5, is\nconsistent with a dimensional crossover.\nThe shift in \u03bc0Hcr to higher applied fields after irradiation signifies that the 3D vortex-glass regime is extended\nto higher applied fields by the fission-fragment damage centres. Hence splayed defect pinning promotes the c-axis\nvortex correlation.\nAn independent measurement of the field dependence of \u03bc was sought to confirm the behaviour observed from\nthe relaxation measurements. Figures 7(a) and (b) show lnE \u2013 lnJ curves at 77 K for the nonirradiated and\nirradiated tapes respectively. The curves have been corrected for parallel silver conduction.39 A crossover from\nnegative to positive curvature can be identified in both tape samples as the applied field is increased. The field at\nwhich the crossover occurs is shifted from \u03bc0H \u2248 0.08 T in the nonirradiated tape to \u03bc0H \u2248 0.44 T after irradiation.\nAs shown in Eq. (10), the change in the curvature of the lnE \u2013 lnJ curves indicates a similar change in the sign\nof \u03bc. The current-voltage measurements therefore also indicate a shift in Hcr to higher applied fields as a\nconsequence of the fission-induced damage.\nThe values of Hcr derived from the magnetisation measurements, \u03bc0Hcr \u2248 0.37 and 0.65 T for the nonirradiated\ntape and irradiated tapes respectively, are higher than those derived from the lnE \u2013 lnJ curves, \u03bc0Hcr \u2248 0.08 T and\n0.44 T, respectively. From fluctuation theory,40 the temperature dependence of the crossover field, due to thermal\nfluctuations of the pancake vortices, is approximately given by\n\u03bc0Hcr \u221d 1/T.\n\n(12)\n\nThe magnetisation measurements are scaled to a temperature T0 \u2248 20K, determined by the lowest temperature used\nfor the scaling analysis. The I \u2013 V curves, on the other hand, are measured at T = 77 K. Therefore, the differences\nin Hcr can be explained as a result of the different measurement temperatures. We thus expect a difference of ~ 1\u20444\nbetween measurements of \u03bc0Hcr at 77 and 20 K. The relative difference between the two measurements on the\nnonirradiated samples is ~ 0.22, in good agreement with our expectations. However, because of the strong\ncolumnar pinning, the fluctuation theory is not entirely applicable to the irradiated tape samples without alteration,\nwhere the difference is observed to be ~ 0.6. It may still account for the temperature dependence of \u03bc0Hcr, if not the\nmagnitude of the dependence.\nThe V \u2013 I measurements confirm that the effect of the randomly splayed quasi-columnar defect pinning is to\ndrive the applied field at which the crossover in \u03bc occurs to higher fields. This is consistent with the observation of\nthe Ueff(J) behaviour derived when the relaxation data is analysed using the modified form of Maley' s method (see\nTable III and Fig. 4).\nTo further highlight the consistency found with the empirical temperature scaling method, we compare these\nresults with the ones obtained in the absence of temperature scaling. The sign of \u03bc, and thus the deduced\ndimensionality of the system, is found to be altered radically without the application of a temperature scaling\nprocedure. Over the entire range of applied fields, even at \u03bc0H = 0.15 T, \u03bc < 0 for the irradiated tape.\nThe results from the standard Maley' s method suggest that the vortex system in the irradiated tape is in a 2D\nplastic creep regime over all applied magnetic fields, implying the destruction of the c-axis vortex coherence by the\nintroduction of randomly splayed columnar pins and a drastic reduction in \u03bc0Hcr. The loss of vortex coherence\ncould be explained as a result of vortex cutting14 by the highly splayed columnar pins. This would, however, reduce\nthe effects of the pinning to that of random point disorder,15 inconsistent with the observed improvements in\nUeff(J), Jc and the field dependence of Jc.41\nComparisons of randomly splayed quasi-columnar defects on Y123, Bi2212 and Bi2223 samples revealed\ngreater pinning enhancements in the more highly anisotropic Bi2223.16 At the time, the authors were unable to\nprovide any structural evidence to explain the differences. Based on the observations obtained in this work of the\nincrease in the dimensional crossover, and hence the c-axis vortex correlation, in fission-damaged Bi2223, it\nbecomes clear that the difference lies in the lower anisotropy of the Y123, which promotes vortex line cutting\nrather than an increased inter-layer correlation.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nThe unphysical size and behaviour of a\u03bd0 obtained in the absence of any temperature scaling, the consistency\nfound with the empiric temperature scaling technique, and the agreement with transport voltage \u2013 current\nmeasurements reinforces the conclusion that temperature scaling is required to accurately determine the correct\nflux dynamics of the investigated sample. An empirically obtained temperature scaling is therefore a crucial\naddition to the analysis of magnetisation relaxation measurements.\nIn an uranium-doped, nonirradiated sample of Ag/Bi2223, we observed a transition from 3D elastic creep to 2D\nplastic creep regimes at about 0.37 T. Temperature scaling within the 3D system was observed to be of the form (1t)3/2, as predicted by theory. In the 2D system, the influence of thermal fluctuations was observed at much lower\n\n\ftemperatures, with scaling being of the form (1-t2).\nAfter the introduction of splayed columnar pinning centres by fission-fragment damage, we observe a large\nincrease in the effective activation energy over a wide temperature and field range. The system remained in a 3D\nelastic creep regime up to higher applied fields, with \u03bc0Hcr \u2248 0.65 T. The temperature scaling in the 3D and 2D\nstates was identical to that found for the nonirradiated tape. The introduction of randomly splayed columnar\ndefects by fission-fragment damage therefore promotes the c-axis vortex correlation and extends the 3D vortexglass regime to higher applied fields. This explains the greater efficiency of the uranium-fission method in BSCCO\nrather than the less anisotropic YBCO.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported in part by the Australian Research Council and the Australian Institute of Nuclear\nScience and Engineering.
