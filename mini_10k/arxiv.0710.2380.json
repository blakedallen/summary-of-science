Introduction\nUnderstanding the topological structure of the QCD vacuum remains a central focus of modern\nLattice QCD studies. For computational reasons, most previous studies have focused on gauge\nfields generated using the quenched approximation. In the following proceedings, we present a\nquantitative comparison of vacuum structure for quenched and dynamical-fermion gauge fields.\nThe introduction of fermion loops into the QCD action renormalizes the coupling and demands\nsmaller values for \u03b2 in obtaining the same lattice spacing, a. Smaller \u03b2 values will admit rougher\ngauge fields such that we expect to see a higher density of non-trivial topological excitations,\nparticularly for lighter sea-quark masses. For example, we anticipate larger values for the meansquare topological charge density hq2 (x)ix . This combined with the vanishing of the topological\nsusceptibility in the chiral limit leads to our prediction that the negative dip in the topological\ncharge density correlator, hq(x)q(0)i, will be enhanced in full QCD with light dynamical-fermions.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of the hq(x)q(0)i correlator in full QCD.\n\nIn order to study these differences in vacuum structure on the very large MILC lattices, we\ncommence with the development of a new gluonic definition of the topological charge density,\nfounded on a new form of over-improved [1] stout-link smearing [2] algorithm, designed to stabilize instantons. We then examine the extent to which instanton-like objects are found on the lattice.\nFinally, we investigate the effects of dynamical sea-quark degrees of freedom on topology and find\nthat the magnitudes of the negative dip in the hq(x)q(0)i correlator and the positive hq(0)2 i contact\nterm are both increased with the introduction of dynamical fermion degrees of freedom. The effect\nis significant and is easily observed in the visualizations of the topological charge density provided\nat the close of these proceedings.\n\n2. Over-Improved Stout-Link Smearing\nThe removal of short-distance UV fluctuations is an important aspect of defining the topological charge of a rough gauge-field configuration. For gluonic topological charge operators, one\noften applies iterative smoothing algorithms which hold the risk of destroying the very structures\none hopes to reveal. The corrosion of topological excitations in the QCD vacuum under smoothing\nis due to the presence of discretization errors in the approximation of the action. In the past there\nhave been attempts to remove these errors via the combination of different sized Wilson loops in\nthe calculation of the local action. When combining these loops, one must carefully choose the coefficients of the different shapes in order to cancel the leading order error terms, thereby resulting\nin an improved action [3, 4].\nDespite the improvements, improved actions can still spoil instantons [5]. Consider, for example the Symanzik O(a2 ) improved action, composed of the plaquette (P\u03bc\u03bd ) and rectangular\n(R\u03bc\u03bd , R\u03bd \u03bc ) Wilson loops.\nSS = \u03b2 \u2211\n\n\u2211\n\nx \u03bc <\u03bd\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\u0001\n5\n1\n(1 \u2212 P\u03bc\u03bd (x)) \u2212\n(1 \u2212 R\u03bc\u03bd (x)) + (1 \u2212 R\u03bd \u03bc (x)) ,\n3\n12\n2\n\n(2.1)\n\n\fAspects of QCD Vacuum Structure\n\nWe can Taylor expand the Symanzik action in orders of a and following Perez, et al.

This occurs because the smoothing algorithms are designed to remove action\nand will do so by effectively reducing \u03c1 to obtain a lower action. Eventually the instantons become\nsufficiently small that discretization errors allow them to be removed from the lattice.\nPerez, et al. [1] proposed that instead of combining different loop combinations in order to\nsuppress the discretization errors, they could instead tune their coefficients such that the errors\nbecame positive for a classical instanton. By doing this, instantons should be stable under cooling.\nWe extend their work, using a plaquette plus rectangle action, in the interests of locality, and\nmodern stout-link smearing [2].\nTaking the Symanzik action (2.1) and introducing a new parameter \u03b5 , such that \u03b5 = 1 provides\nthe Wilson action and \u03b5 = 0 provides the Symanzik-improved action, implies the following form\nfor the over-improved action\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0001\n1\u2212\u03b5\n5 \u2212 2\u03b5\n(2.4)\nS(\u03b5 ) = \u03b2 \u2211 \u2211\n(1 \u2212 P\u03bc\u03bd (x)) \u2212\n(1 \u2212 R\u03bc\u03bd (x)) + (1 \u2212 R\u03bd \u03bc (x)) .\n3\n12\nx \u03bc <\u03bd\nTaylor expanding this action for the classical instanton solution, one finds that for \u03b5 < 0 the leading\norder a2 errors are positive\n\"\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013#\n\u03b5 a 2 14\u03b5 \u2212 17 a 4\n8\u03c0 2\ninst\n+\n.\n(2.5)\nS (\u03b5 ) = 2 1 \u2212\ng\n5 \u03c1\n210\n\u03c1\n\nThe question is now: How negative should \u03b5 be? To answer this, we propose the following method.\nGiven S(\u03b5 ), select some value of \u03b5 and plot S(\u03b5 )/S0 as a function of \u03c1 . Ideally this will result\nin a straight line at S(\u03b5 )/S0 = 1. What we actually observe is illustrated in Fig. 1. Note that it is\nthe value of the slope of the curve that is important when deciding how an instanton will change\nunder a given smoothing algorithm. Varying \u03b5 results in curves of varying slope. We settled on a\nvalue of \u03b5 = \u22120.25 as providing a nice result.\n\n3. Vacuum Structure\nWith the over-improved stout-link smearing procedure completely defined we now proceed\nto perform a study of topological excitations in the QCD vacuum. We also provide a few results\nobtained using a 3-loop improved cooling algorithm [4]. We use one set of quenched gauge fields\nand two sets of dynamical gauge fields in order to investigate the effect of dynamical sea quarks\nand varying quark mass. The gauge fields were generated by the MILC collaboration [7, 8], and\ntheir details are summarized in Table 1.\n3\n\n\fAspects of QCD Vacuum Structure\n\nFigure 1: S(\u03b5 )/S0 versus the instanton size, \u03c1 , for the Wilson action, Symanzik-improved action, Perez\nover-improved action, and our over-improved action S(\u22120.25). S0 is the action for a single instanton. To\npreserve instantons the ideal smoothing action would give a straight line at S(\u03b5 )/S0 = 1. The slope of each\ncurve dictates how an instanton in the gauge field will evolve under smearing. Our action should be the most\nstable because it is mostly flat and has a dislocation threshold, given by its maximum, at \u03c1 \u223c 1.5.\n\n3.1 Topological Charge Density Correlator\nRecent studies of vacuum structure in Lattice QCD [9, 10] have revolved around the use of\nthe overlap topological charge density operator [11]. The overlap operator has the benefit of producing an integer topological charge and was first to reveal the negative topological charge density\ncorrelator, hq(x)q(0)i [10] for x > 0. Unfortunately, the overlap operator is very computationally\nintensive. Thus we examine the issue of whether a traditional smearing method can produce a\nnegative correlator. Using the quenched gauge fields, we calculate the hq(x)q(0)i correlator on\nsmoothed gauge fields with a three-loop O(a4 )-improved lattice field strength tensor [4]. Fig. 2\nreports the results.\n3.2 Instanton-Like Objects\nRepeated application of a smearing algorithm will eventually reveal the presence of spherical\ninstantons in a gauge field. However, after only a small number of sweeps, these objects tend to be\nfar from spherical. We now wish to investigate the similarity of these objects to instantons.\nUsing over-improved smearing we analyze the action density of a smeared field to determine\nthe peaks of maximum action and fit the instanton action density to our data. From this we can\nextract a size, \u03c1 , for the instanton. We also extract the charge at the centre of the instanton-like\nTable 1: Parameters of the gauge fields used for this investigation.

We see that\nfor a small number of sweeps it is possible to obtain a negative hq(x)q(0)i correlator, similar to the recent\noverlap results [10]. Note that errors were calculated using a first-order jackknife procedure but are too small\nto see.\n\nFigure 3: q(x0 ) versus the instanton size \u03c1 for 4 and 20 sweeps of over-improved stout-link smearing.\nCalculation details are in the text. We see that for 4 sweeps of smearing the peaks do not seem to represent\ninstantons, but that as we smooth further the points start to cluster around the predicted line.\n\nobject, q(x0 ). Thus, if there is good agreement between the extracted q(x0 ) and that predicted by\n\u03c1 , then we can say that the object is locally representative of an instanton.\nIn Fig. 3 we plot q(x0 ) vs \u03c1 for a quenched gauge field after both 4 and 20 sweeps of overimproved stout-link smearing. Each cross represents a peak in the action density. If the peak were\nto represent an instanton then its cross should lie on the theoretical curve. We see that for 4 sweeps\nof smearing the peaks do not appear to represent instantons. As more UV fluctuations are removed\nthe crosses lie closer to the line.\n3.3 The Vacuum Structure of Dynamical Gauge Fields\nSeveral studies of the differences in vacuum structure between quenched and dynamical fields\nhave focused on the topological susceptibility\nZ\n\n\u03c7 = h d 4 x q(x) q(0)i =\n5\n\nhQ2 i\nV\n\n(3.1)\n\n\fAspects of QCD Vacuum Structure\n\nFigure 4: The topological charge density correlator hq(x)q(0)i for the quenched, light and heavy dynamicalfermion gauge fields. It is interesting to see how the dynamical fermion loops have caused the negative dip\nto increase in magnitude, and how this effect is greater for lighter quark masses. Although not shown, the\npositive contact term hq2 (0)i has also increased in magnitude. Exact values are given in the text.\n\nWe now extend these studies of the topological susceptibility to the hq(x)q(0)i correlator. It has\nbeen shown that [12]\nZ\n\nh d 4 x q(x) q(0)i \u223c m\u03c02 \u2192 0 in the chiral limit,\n\n(3.2)\n\nand therefore |Q| \u2192 0 also. This leads to three scenarios for how the shape of the hq(x)q(0)i could\nchange in the presence of dynamical quarks. Either the positive contact term and the magnitude\nof the negative component could both increase or decrease, or they could stay the same. The\nonly requirement is that the integral of the correlator vanishes in the chiral limit. However, as we\ndiscussed in the introduction, fermion-loop coupling renormalization leads to smaller \u03b2 admitting\nlarger field fluctuations. We therefore expect that hq(0)2 i should increase, and thus so must the\nnegative component of hq(x)q(0)i increase in magnitude.\nFig. 4 shows the topological charge density correlator as calculated for the three different\ntypes of gauge fields. We see that the presence of dynamical quarks has caused the magnitude of\nthe negative component of the correlator to increase, and that this effect is greater for lighter quark\nmasses. The x-intercept has also moved closer towards 0. Although not shown in the plot, the mean\nsquare density hq2 (0)i has also increased in magnitude. The exact values of the positive contact\nterm are; quenched = 2924 \u00b1 4 fm\u22128 , heavy = 5251 \u00b1 12 fm\u22128 , light = 5432 \u00b1 8 fm\u22128\nWe expect that this behaviour will be readily apparent in visualizations of the charge density,\nq(x). Plots of q(x) are shown in Fig. 5, and indeed we observe that the light and heavy gauge fields\ncontain many more non-trivial field fluctuations.\n\n4. Conclusion\nWe have presented the first calculation of the topological charge density correlator, hq(x)q(0)i,\nin full QCD. Using both 3-loop improved cooling and the new over-improved stout-link smearing\nprocedure we are able to obtain negative hq(x)q(0)i correlators. Using our proven methodology\na quantitative comparison of quenched and dynamical gauge fields is performed.

Each field has been smoothed using 4 sweeps of over-improved stoutlink smearing. We see that the bottom two dynamical gauge fields contain a higher density of non-trivial\ntopological charge density than the quenched field. However it is difficult to see the difference between the\ntwo dynamical gauge fields.\n\ngauge fields show an increase in non-trivial vacuum field fluctuations. This is observed directly\nthrough visualizations of the topological charge density and via the calculation of the hq(x)q(0)i\ncorrelator. For the correlator we see an increase in the magnitude of the negative dip and positive\ncontact term with larger effects for lighter quark masses. These observations are in accord with\nexpectation, outlined in greater detail in a forthcoming publication [13].\n\nReferences\n[1] Margarita Garcia Perez et al., Nucl. Phys.
