The BPS configurations are generalisations of\nabelian and non-abelian vortices.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nTwo-dimensional field theories have found many applications in string theory.\nFor example, two-dimensional sigma models and some two-dimensional gauge\ntheories have been used to model the dynamics of fundamental and D-strings,\nrespectively. The small fluctuations of strings which arise as intersections in\nvarious brane configurations are described by two-dimensional gauge theories\ncoupled to scalars. Because of this, many of the properties and the various\nobjects that arise in gauge theories coupled to scalars have a brane interpretation [1, 2, 3, 4]. Supersymmetric gauge theories coupled to linear sigma models\nhave been constructed in [5] and they have been used to illuminate the relation between Landau-Ginzburg models and Calabi-Yau spaces. Recently a\ntwo-dimensional gauged theory coupled to a linear sigma model was used to\ninvestigate aspects of the dynamics of vortices using branes [6].\nIn two dimensions, the Wess-Zumino term has the same mass dimension as\nthe kinetic term of sigma model scalars. Therefore two-dimensional supersymmetric gauged theories can couple to non-linear sigma model matter which also\nhas a non-vanishing Wess-Zumino coupling. Such a theory is renormalizable.\nThe gauging of supersymmetric two-dimensional non-linear sigma models with\na Wess-Zumino term has been considered in [7, 8]. However in these papers the\npart of the action which involves the gauge field kinetic terms has not been given.\nIt has been found in [7] that the Wess-Zumino term of a non-linear sigma model\ncannot always be gauged. The conditions for gauging a Wess-Zumino term have\nbeen identified as the obstructions to the extension of the closed form associated with the Wess-Zumino term to an element of the equivariant cohomology\n[9] of the sigma model target space [10]. Scalar potentials for supersymmetric\ntwo-dimensional sigma models with Wess-Zumino term have been investigated\nin [11, 12, 13, 14].\nIn this paper we shall construct the actions of (p,0)- and (p,1)-supersymmetric,\n1 \u2264 p \u2264 4, two-dimensional gauge theories coupled to non-linear sigma model\nmatter and with non-vanishing Wess-Zumino term. In addition we shall also\nconsider the scalar potentials that arise in these theories. This will generalise\nvarious partial results that have already appeared in the literature. To simplify\nthe description of the results from here on, we shall use the term 'sigma models'\ninstead of the term 'non-linear sigma models' unless otherwise explicitly stated.\nThe method we shall use to construct the various actions of supersymmetric\ntwo-dimensional gauged theories coupled to sigma models is based on the superfields found in the context of supersymmetric sigma models [15, 16] and later\nused in the context supersymmetric gauged sigma models [8]. One advantage\nof this method is that it keeps manifest the various geometric properties of the\ncouplings that appear in these theories. This will be used in the second part\nof the paper to construct of various bounds for vortices. Since the parts of the\nactions that we shall describe involving the kinetic term of the sigma model\nscalars, the Wess-Zumino term and their couplings to gauge fields are known,\nwe shall focus on the kinetic term of the gauge fields and the scalar potentials\nof these theories. We shall allow the gauge couplings to depend on the sigma\n2\n\n\fmodel scalars and we shall derive the various conditions on these couplings required by gauge invariance and supersymmetry. We shall find that the scalar\npotential of gauge theories coupled to sigma models in two dimensions, even\nin the presence of Wess-Zumino term, is the sum of a 'F' term or a 'D' term\nor both. The presence of a D-term, or Fayet-Iliopoulos term, may come as a\nsurprise. This is because in the presence of a Wess-Zumino term the geometry\nof the target space, say, of (2,0)-supersymmetric models where such a term is\nexpected, is not K\u00e4hler and but K\u00e4hler with torsion (KT). Thus the K\u00e4hler\nform is not closed and there are no obvious moment maps. However, it has\nbeen shown in [17] that KT geometries under certain conditions admit moment\nmaps and are those that appear in the Fayet-Iliopoulos term of these models.\nSimilar results hold for the (4,0)-supersymmetric models. We shall observe that\nthe gauged (p,1), p = 1, 2, 4, multiplets are associated with scalar superfields.\nFor the gauge theories with (2,1) and (4,1) supersymmetry, these scalar multiplets satisfy the same supersymmetry constraints as the associated sigma model\nmultiplets. Therefore these gauge theories can be thought of as sigma models\nwith target spaces LG \u2297 Rp , p = 1, 2, 4. This will allow us to combine the\n(p,1) gauge multiplet and the standard sigma model (p, 1) multiplet to a new\nsigma model multiplet. As a result, sigma model type of actions can be written\nfor these gauge theories coupled to matter for which the associated couplings\ndepend on the scalar fields of both the sigma model and gauge multiplets. This\ngeneralizes the results of [8].\nIn the second part of this paper, we shall show that the Euclidean actions\nof (2,0)- and (4,0)-supersymmetric two-dimensional gauge theories coupled to\nsigma models with a Fayet-Iliopoulos term but with vanishing Wess-Zumino\nterm admit bounds. In particular we shall find that the Euclidean action SE\nof the (2,0)-supersymmetric theory is bounded by the absolute value of a topological charge Q which is the integral over the two-dimensional spacetime of\nthe equivariant extension of the K\u00e4hler form of its sigma model target space,\nSE \u2265 |Q|. The sigma model manifold in the (4,0)-supersymmetric theory is\nhyper-K\u00e4hler and so there are three K\u00e4hler forms each having an equivariant extension. The Euclidean action SE of the (4,0)-supersymmetric theory is bounded\nby the length of the three topological charges Q1 , Q2 , Q3 each associated with\nthe integral over the two-dimensional\np spacetime of the equivariant extensions\nof the three K\u00e4hler forms, SE \u2265 Q21 + Q22 + Q23 . This is another application\nof the equivariant cohomology in the context of two-dimensional gauged sigma\nmodels which is distinct from that found in [10] and we have mentioned above.\n(For many other applications see for example [18].) The configurations that saturate these bounds are vortices and include the Nielsen-Olesen type of vortices\n[19] associated with gauge theories coupled to linear sigma models. In particular\nthe bounds above generalise that found by Bogomol'nyi in [20] for the abelian\nvortices of a gauge theory coupled to a single linear complex scalar field.\nWe also find that similar bounds exist in higher dimensions for action type\nof functionals that involve maps between K\u00e4hler manifolds of any dimension\ncoupled to gauge fields or maps from a K\u00e4hler manifold into a hyper-K\u00e4hler\nmanifold again coupled to gauge fields. The structure of these functionals is\n3\n\n\fsuch that it includes the Euclidean actions of some supersymmetric gauge theories in higher dimensions coupled to sigma models with Fayet-Iliopoulos terms.\nIn particular the first case, which involves maps between two-K\u00e4hler spaces, includes the Euclidean action of a four-dimensional N = 1 supersymmetric gauge\ntheory coupled to a sigma model. The latter case, which involved maps from a\nK\u00e4hler manifold into a hyper-K\u00e4hler one, can be associated with the Euclidean\naction of a four-dimensional N = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory coupled to a\nsigma model. Note that in N = 1 theories in four dimensions the sigma model\ntarget space is K\u00e4hler while in the N = 2 theories in four dimensions the sigma\nmodel target space is hyper-K\u00e4hler. In all these cases the action functionals\nare bounded by topological charges which involve the equivariant extensions of\nthe K\u00e4hler forms of the sigma model target space as well as the second Chern\ncharacter of the gauge fields. Our results are different from those of [21, 22] for\nnon-abelian vortices which involve non-abelian gauge theories coupled to linear\nsigma model matter. Note that in the bound constructed in [21], the topological term involves the first class and second Chern character of the gauge\nfields instead of the equivariant extension of the K\u00e4hler form and the second\nChern character of the gauge field that we find. It turns out that in the case of\ngauge theories coupled to linear sigma models of [5] the two different topological\ncharges can be related, see also [23]. However this involves a partial integration\nprocedure in which various surface terms are taken to vanish. We remark that\nin the construction of the bounds that involve the equivariant extensions of the\nK\u00e4hler forms, and also in [20], the topological terms are identified with what\nremains after writing the Euclidean actions of the theories as a sum of squares\nwithout the use of partial integrations. It is clear that our results can also be\nused to construct bounds for solitons in appropriate gauge theories coupled to\nsigma model matter in odd-spacetime dimensions. This is the usual situation\nwhere instantons in a n-dimensional theory can be thought of as static solitons\nof a (n+1)-dimensional theory. In particular, there is a bound for the energy of\nstatic configurations of a three-dimensional N = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory coupled to sigma model matter. This new bound is an extension to gauged\ntheories of the of bounds found in [24] and generalizes that of [25].\nThis paper is organised as follows: In section two, we shall describe nonsupersymmetric gauge theories coupled to sigma model matter to set up our\nnotation and give some universal conditions which appear in all such models.\nIn section three, we shall describe the (1,0)-supersymmetric gauge theories coupled to sigma model matter with a Wess-Zumino term. We shall also give the\nscalar potential of the system. In sections four and five, we shall describe the\n(2,0)- and (4,0)-supersymmetric gauge theories coupled to sigma model matter\nand give the scalar potentials of the systems. We shall find that these systems have Fayet-Iliopoulos terms constructed from the moment maps of KT\nand HKT geometries, respectively. In section six, we shall describe the (1,1)supersymmetric gauge theory coupled to sigma model matter. We shall find\nthat both the gauge multiplet and the sigma model multiplet are scalar superfields allowing for non-polynomial interactions between them. In sections seven\nand eight, we shall describe the (2,1)- and (4,1)-supersymmetric gauge theories\n4\n\n\fcoupled to sigma model matter and give the scalar potentials of the systems.\nIn both these theories the gauge multiplets and the sigma model multiplets are\nscalar superfields and therefore admit non-polynomial interactions. In section\nnine, we describe a bound for the Euclidean action of a (2,0)-supersymmetric\ngauge theory without Wess-Zumino term. We show that the equivariant extension of the K\u00e4hler class enters in the bound. The BPS configurations are\nvortices and the scalar fields take values in a curved manifold M . In section ten,\nwe describe a bound for the Euclidean action of a (4,0)-supersymmetric gauge\ntheory without Wess-Zumino term. We show that the topological term in the\nbound is a linear combination equivariant extensions of the K\u00e4hler classes of\nthe hyper-K\u00e4hler manifold which is the sigma model target space. In sections\neleven and twelve, we present a generalisation of the bounds we have described\nfor (2,0)- and (4,0)-supersymmetric models to a class of gauge theories coupled\nto scalars which are maps between K\u00e4hler manifolds or from a K\u00e4hler manifold\nto a hyper-K\u00e4hler, respectively. The topological term this time involves, apart\nfrom the equivariant extensions of K\u00e4hler forms, the second Chern character of\nthe gauge connection. Finally in section thirteen, we give our conclusions.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nTwo-dimensional gauged sigma models with\nWess-Zumino term\nGeometric Data and Action\n\nTo describe two-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories coupled to sigma\nmodel matter with a Wess-Zumino term, it is instructive to begin with a\nnon-supersymmetric system as a toy example. Let \u039e be the two-dimensional\n+ , x= ). The fields of the\nMinkowski spacetime with light-cone coordinates (x+\nmodel that we shall consider here are the following: a gauge potential A with\ngauge group G, sigma model matter fields \u03c6 which are locally maps from \u039e into\na sigma model manifold or target space M and real fermions \u03c8\u2212 and \u03bb+ on \u039e\nof opposite chirality.\nThe couplings of two-dimensional gauged sigma model are described by a\nRiemannian metric g on M and the Wess-Zumino term which is a locally-defined\ntwo-form b on M ; H = db is a globally defined closed three-form on M . In\naddition, the gauge group G acts on M leaving invariant both the metric and\nthe Wess-Zumino term, ie\nLa g = 0\n\nLa H = 0\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere La is the Lie-derivative with respect to the vector fields {\u03bea : a =\n1, . . . , dim LG} generated by the action of the gauge group G on M ; LG is\nthe Lie algebra of G. Therefore, we have\n[\u03bea , \u03beb ]i = \u2212fab c \u03bec i ,\n\n5\n\n(2.2)\n\n\fwhere f are the structure constants of G; a, b, c = 1, . . . , dim LG are gauge\nindices. The first condition in (2.1) implies that \u03bea are Killing vectors, ie\n\u2207i \u03beaj + \u2207j \u03beai = 0\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere \u2207 is the Levi-Civita connection of g and i, j = 1, . . . , dim M . The second\ncondition in (2.1) together with dH = 0 imply that ia H is closed and so\n\u03bea i Hijk = 2\u2202[j wk]a\n\n(2.4)\n\nfor some locally defined one-form wa .\nIt is useful to give a geometric interpretation for the gauge potential A of\nthe sigma model field \u03c6. Let P be a principal bundle over the spacetime \u039e\nwith fibre the gauge group G. The gauge potential A is locally the pull-back\nof a connection one-form A of P onto a open set of the spacetime \u039e. The\nsigma model maps \u03c6 are sections of the bundle P \u00d7G M . Locally they can be\nrepresented as maps from the spacetime \u039e into M .\nTo describe the couplings of the fermions, we consider two vector bundles\nE and F over M equipped with connections B and C and with fibre metrics\nh and k, respectively. The fermions \u03c8\u2212 and \u03bb+ can be thought of as sections\nof S\u2212 \u2297 E and S+ \u2297 F , respectively, where S\u2212 and S+ are spin bundles over \u039e\nassociated to the two inequivalent real representation of Spin(1, 1). Note that\nin two dimensions there are Majorana-Weyl fermions and so two inequivalent\none-dimensional real spinor representations of Spin(1, 1). In addition we shall\nassume that the connections B and C as well as the fibre metrics h and k are\ninvariant under the action of the gauge group on M . These conditions imply\nthat\nLa Bi AB = \u2212\u2207i Ua AB\nLa hAB = \u2212Ua\n\nC\n\nA hCB\n\n(2.5)\n\u2212 Ua\n\nC\n\nB hAC\n\n,\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhere\n\u2207i Ua AB = \u2202i Ua AB + Bi A C Ua C B \u2212 Ua A C Bi C B ,\n\n(2.7)\n\nand Ua are infinitesimal gauge transformations, A, B, C = 1, . . . , rank E, and\nsimilarly for the connection C and fibre metric k.

The conditions for\nthis term to be written in a two-dimensional form as well as the conditions for\nthe gauge invariance of the action will be investigated in the next section, see\nalso [7].\n\n2.2\n\nConditions for gauge invariance\n\nThe gauge transformations of the fields are\n\u03b4\u01eb Aa\u03bc = \u2212\u2207\u03bc \u01eba\n\u03b4\u01eb \u03c6i = \u01eba \u03beai\n\n(2.14)\n\nA\nB\n\u03b4\u01eb \u03c8\u2212\n= \u01eba Ua AB \u03c8\u2212\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nB\na\nA\n\u03b4\u01eb \u03bbA\n+ = \u01eb Va B \u2032 \u03bb+\n\n\u2032\n\nwhere \u01eb is the parameter of infinitesimal gauge transformations. Some of the\nconditions required for the invariance of the action (2.8) have been incorporated\nas part of the geometric data of the sigma model in the previous section. In\nparticular, in addition to the conditions (2.1) and (2.5), we require that (i) wa\nis a globally defined one-form on M which (ii) satisfies\nLa wb = \u2212fab c wc .\n\n(2.15)\n\nTo write the Wess-Zumino part of the action in a two-dimensional form, it\nis necessary for the relevant three form to be closed. This in addition requires\nthat\n\u03beai wib + \u03bebi wia = 0 .\n\n7\n\n(2.16)\n\n\fThen the three-dimensional part of the action (2.8) can be written locally [7] as\nZ\ni\nj\na\ni\nS \u2032 = d2 x bij \u2202+\n+ \u03c6 \u2202= \u03c6 \u2212 A+\n+ wia \u2207= \u03c6\n(2.17)\n\u0001\ni\na b\ni\n.\n+ Aa= wia \u2207+\n\u03c6\n+\nA\nA\n\u03be\nw\nai\n+\n+\n+ = b\nThe conditions above that require (i) H to be invariant under the group action,\n(ii) wa to be globally defined on M , (iii) (2.15) and (iv) (2.16) are those for the\nclosed form H to have an extension, i.e. equivariant extension [9], as a closed\nform in M \u00d7G EG [10].\nNext let us consider the conditions for gauge invariance of part of the action (2.8) involving the fermions. We find that this requires that\nLc uab + udb f dca + uad f dcb = 0\n\n(2.18)\n\nfor the gauge couplings uab ,\nLa Ub \u2212 Lb Ua = [Ua , Ub ] \u2212 fab c Uc\n\n(2.19)\n\nLa V = 0 .\n\n(2.20)\n\nand\n\nWe have not assumed that \u2207i h = 0. However given a connection on a vector\nbundle with a fibre metric h, there always exist another connection \u2207\u2032 such\nthat \u2207\u2032i h = 0. Suppose that the \u2207\u2032 is used for the fermionic couplings. If this\nis the case, the gauge group is O(N ) and therefore the right-hand-side of (2.6)\nvanishes.\nObserve that the equation (2.5) can be written in a more covariant form as\n\u03beaj Gij AB = \u2207i \u03bcaAB .\n\n(2.21)\n\nIn what follows we shall assume that the conditions stated in this section\nby requiring gauge invariance of the non-supersymmetric model described by\nthe action (2.8) hold. We shall see that for supersymmetric sigma models more\nconditions are necessary.\n\n3\n\n(1, 0) supersymmetric gauged models\n\nThe (1,0)-supersymmetric gauged sigma model involves the coupling of three\ndifferent (1,0)-multiplets. To simplify the construction of this model we shall\ndescribe each multiplet and the conditions for supersymmetry and gauge invariance separately. There are different ways of approaching this problem. Here\nwe shall use 'standard' (1,0)-superfields. The action will be constructed using\n(1,0)-superspace methods.\n\n8\n\n\f3.1\n\nThe gauge multiplet\n\n+ , x= , \u03b8 + ), where (x+\n+ , x= ) are\nThe (1,0)-superspace \u039e1,0 has coordinates (x+\n+\nbosonic light-cone coordinates and \u03b8 is a Grassmann odd-coordinate. The\n(1,0)-supersymmetric Yang-Mills multiplet with gauge group G is described by\na connection A in superspace which has components (A+\n+ , A= , A+ ). In addition,\nit is required that these satisfy the supersymmetry constraints [8]\n\n[\u2207+ , \u2207+ ] = 2i\u2207+\n[\u2207+\n+\n+ , \u2207= ] = F+\n+=\n[\u2207+ , \u2207= ] = W\u2212 ,\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere F+\n+= , W\u2212 are the components of the curvature of the superspace connection A. (The gauge indices have been suppressed.) Jacobi identities imply\nthat\n\u2207+ W\u2212 = iF+\n+=\n\n(3.2)\n\nTherefore the independent components of the gauge multiplet are\n\u03c7a = W\u2212 |\n\na\na\nF+\n+= = \u2212i\u2207+ W\u2212 |\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere \u03c7a is the gaugino and F a is the two-form gauge field strength and the\nvertical line denotes evaluation of the associated superfield at \u03b8+ = 0. This\nnotation for identifying the components of a superfield will also be used later\nfor other theories.\n\n3.2\n\nSigma model multiplets\n\nTo described the sigma model multiplet that couples to the above gauge field,\nwe introduce a Riemannian manifold M with metric g and a locally defined two\nform b. In addition we assume that M admits a vector bundle E with fibre\nmetric h, connection B and a section s. The data required for the description\nof the sigma model multiplet are the same as those given in section 2.1. In\naddition we take the section s to satisfy\nLa sA = \u2212Ua BA sB .\n\n(3.4)\n\nThe (1, 0)-supersymmetric sigma model multiplet is described by a real scalar\nsuperfield \u03c6 and a fermionic superfield \u03c8\u2212 .

In such case the last condition in (4.10) is satisfied. Decomposing E \u2297C\nas E \u2297 C = E \u2295 \u0112 using I, the first condition implies that E is a holomorphic\nvector bundle. Then the second condition in (4.10) implies that the section L\nis the real part of a holomorphic section of E.\nThe components of the fermionic multiplet are as follows:\n \u0303 0+ \u03c8 A | ,\nlA =\u2207\n\u2212\n\nA\nA\n\u03c8\u2212\n= \u03c8\u2212\n|\n\n(4.11)\n\nwhere \u03c8\u2212 is a two-dimensional real chiral fermion and l is an auxiliary field.\n\n4.4\n\nAction\n\nThe action of the (2,0)-supersymmetric gauged sigma model can be written as\nS = Sg + S\u03c3 + Sf ,\n\n(4.12)\n\nwhere Sg is the action of the gauge multiplet, S\u03c3 is the action of the sigma-model\nmultiplet and Sf is the action of the fermionic multiplet.

Both u0 and u1\nare not necessarily symmetric in the gauge indices. The above action can be\nwritten in different ways. However there are always field and coupling constant\nredefinitions which can bring the action to the above form.\nObserve that this action is not an integral over the full \u039e2,0 superspace.\nTherefore it is not manifestly (2,0)-supersymmetric. The requirement of invariance under (2,0) supersymmetry imposes the conditions\nJ j i \u2202j u0 = \u2212\u2202i u1\nJ j i \u2202j z 1 = \u2212\u2202i z 0 .\n\n(4.14)\n\nThis is most easily seen by verifying that the Lagrangian density is independent\n+ , x= -surface terms.

After integrating over the odd coordinate \u03b81+ we recover the\naction (4.13). Observe that the action (4.15) simplifies if one takes u0 , u1 to be\nsymmetric matrices.

The above action can be written in different\nways. However there are always field and coupling constant redefinitions which\nbring the action to the above form.\nObserve that this action is not an integral over the full \u039e4,0 superspace.\nTherefore it is not manifestly (4,0)-supersymmetry.

It has been shown in [17] that under\ncertain assumptions the space of vacua inherits the HKT structure of the sigma\nmodel manifold M and it is a smooth space.

The superfields of the (1,1)-supersymmetric gauge theory coupled\nto sigma model matter are maps Z = (\u03c6, W ) from the (1,1) superspace \u039e1,1 into\nL, where \u03c6 is the usual (1,1) sigma model superfield and W is the (1,1) gauge\ntheory multiplet. We again allow the gauge group G to act on L with a group\naction on M and the adjoint action on L(G). The vector fields generated by\nsuch a group action are\n\u03bea = \u03beaA \u2202A = \u03beai \u2202i + W b f c ab \u2202c\n\n(6.12)\n\nwhere A = (i, a), the component \u03be i is allowed to depend on both \u03c6 and W , and\nthe partial derivative with the gauge index denotes differential with respect to\nW.\nNext we introduce a metric g and a Wess-Zumino term H on L and assume\nthat the gauge group G acts on L with isometries leaving the Wess-Zumino\nterm H invariant. We also define w as i\u03bea H = dwa , where \u03bea is the new Killing\nvector field (6.12). Then an action can be written for this new sigma model as\nZ\n\u0001\nS\u03c3 = d2 xd\u03b8+ d\u03b8\u2212 gAB \u2207+ Z A \u2207\u2212 Z B + h\nZ\n(6.13)\n\u0001\nA\nB\nC\nB\na\n2\n+\n\u2212\n+ d xdtd\u03b8 d\u03b8 HABC \u2202t Z \u2207+ Z \u2207\u2212 Z \u2212 wBa \u2202t Z W\u2212\nwhere h is a function which depends on Z. This action is clearly supersymmetric\nbecause it is a full (1,1) superspace integral. Gauge invariance requires that w\nabove satisfies all the conditions stated in section 2.2 but for the group action\nwith associated vector fields (6.12) and a Wess-Zumino term in L. In addition,\ngauge invariance requires that\nLa h = 0\n\n(6.14)\n\nwhere the Lie derivative is with respect to the vector field (6.12).\n\n6.7\n\nScalar Potential\n\nTo compute the scalar potential we express the action in components and eliminate the auxiliary field of the sigma model superfield \u03c6 from the action using\nthe field equations. The scalar potential is\n1\nV (W, \u03c6) = g ij \u2202i h\u2202j h ,\n(6.15)\n4\nwhere g ij is the inverse of the restriction of the metric of L on M . Observe that\nV depends on both the sigma model scalar \u03c6 and the gauge multiplet scalar\nW . The classical supersymmetric vacua of the theory are those values of (\u03c6, W )\nfor which \u2202i h = 0. For example, for the special (1,1)-supersymmetric model\ninvestigated in the beginning of the section, V = 41 g ij (\u2202i h + \u2202i za W a )(\u2202j h +\n\u2202j zb W b ), where in this case h = h(\u03c6).\n27\n\n\f7\n7.1\n\n(2, 1) supersymmetry\nThe gauge multiplet\n\n+ , x= , \u03b8 + , \u03b8 \u2212 ), where (x+\n+ , x= ) are\nThe (2, 1) superspace \u039e2,1 has coordinates (x+\np\n+\n+\n\u2212\nthe even and (\u03b80 , \u03b81 , \u03b8 ) are odd coordinates. The (2,1)-supersymmetric YangMills multiplet is described by a connection A in superspace with components\n(A+\n+ , A= , Ap+ , A\u2212 ), p = 0, 1. In addition it is required that these satisfy the\nsupersymmetry constraints [8]\n\n[\u2207+\n+=\n+ , \u2207= ] = F+\n\n[\u2207p+ , \u2207\u2212 ] = Wp\n\n[\u2207\u2212 , \u2207\u2212 ] = 2i\u2207= .\n\n[\u2207p+ , \u2207q+ ] = 2i\u03b4pq \u2207+\n+\n\n(7.1)\n\nWe have suppressed the gauge indices. We remark that Wp are scalar superfields.\nThe Jacobi identities imply that\n[\u2207\u2212 , \u2207+\n+ ] = i\u22070+ W0\n\n[\u2207p+ , \u2207= ] = i\u2207\u2212 Wp\na\nF+\n+=\n\n=\n\n\u22070+ \u2207\u2212 W0a\n\n\u22071+ W1 = \u22070+ W0\n\n(7.2)\n\n\u22071+ W0 + \u22070+ W1 = 0 .\nThe two scalar superfields (W0 , W1 ) can be viewed as a map W from the (2,1)\nsuperspace \u039e2,1 into LG\u2297 R2 , where LG is the Lie algebra of the group G. Next\nintroduce a complex structure I = Id \u2297 \u01eb in LG \u2297 R2 where \u01eb is the constant\ncomplex structure in R2 with \u01eb0 1 = \u22121. The last two conditions in (7.1) can be\nexpressed as\n\u22071+ W ap = \u01ebp q \u22070+ W aq .\n\n(7.3)\n\nIn fact this implies that W is a covariantly chiral superfield, (\u22071+ + i\u22070+ )(W1 +\niW0 ) = 0.\nThe components of the gauge superfields Wp are\nWp = Wp |\n\u03c70+ = \u22070+ W0 |\n\nF+\n+= = \u22070+ \u2207\u2212 W0 |\n\u03c71+ = \u22070+ W1 |\n\nf = \u22070+ \u2207\u2212 W1 |\n\u03c7p\u2212 = \u2207\u2212 Wp | ,\n(7.4)\n\nwhere Wp are scalars, \u03c7p+ and \u03c7p\u2212 are the gaugini which are real chiral fermions\nin two dimensions, F+\n+= is the field strength and f is a real auxiliary field. As\nin the (1,1)-supersymmetric gauge theory, the gauge multiplet is determined by\nscalar superfields. This will lead again to non-polynomial interactions between\nthe gauge and sigma multiplets of the theory.\n\n7.2\n\nThe sigma model multiplet\n\nLet M be a KT manifold with metric g and complex structure J. We in addition\nassume that the gauge group G acts on M with isometries which furthermore\npreserve the complex structure J and the Wess-Zumino term H. These conditions are the same as those in the case of (2,0)-supersymmetric theory. The\n28\n\n\f(2,1) sigma model superfield \u03c6 is a map from the (2,1) superspace \u039e2,1 into the\nsigma model manifold M . In addition it is required that\n\u22071+ \u03c6i = J i j \u22070+ \u03c6j ,\n\n(7.5)\n\nwhere \u2207p+ \u03c6i = Dp+ \u03c6i + Aap+ \u03beai and \u03bea are the vector fields on M generated\nby the group action. As we have seen, the (2,1) gauge multiplet satisfies the\ncondition (7.3) similar to (7.5). The superfield \u03c6 is also covariantly chiral, as can\nbe seen by choosing complex coordinates on the sigma model manifold M . These\nresults will be used later for the construction of actions of (2,1)-supersymmetric\ngauge theories coupled to sigma models.\nThe components of the sigma model multiplet \u03c6 are as follows:\n\u03c6i = \u03c6i |\n\nli = \u22070+ \u2207\u2212 \u03c6i |\n\u03bbi\u2212 =\u2207\u2212 \u03c6i | ,\n\n\u03bbi+ =\u22070+ \u03c6i |\n\n(7.6)\n\nwhere \u03c6 is a scalar, \u03bb+ and \u03bb\u2212 are real fermions, and l is an auxiliary field.\n\n7.3\n\nAction\n\nAn action of a (2,1)-supersymmetric gauge theory coupled to sigma model matter can be written as\nS = Sg + S\u03c3 + Sp ,\n\n(7.7)\n\nwhere Sg is the action of the gauge multiplet, S\u03c3 is the action of the sigmamodel multiplet and Sp contains the potential term. We shall describe each\nterm separately.\n\n7.4\n\nThe gauge multiplet action\n\nAn action for the (2,1)-supersymmetric gauge multiplet is\nZ\nSg = d2 xd\u03b80+ d\u03b8\u2212 \u2212 u0ab \u03b4 pq \u22070+ Wpa \u2207\u2212 Wqb\n+ u1ab \u03b4 pq \u22071+ Wpa \u2207\u2212 Wqb + zap Wpa\n\n(7.8)\n\u0001\n\nwhere u0 , u1 are the gauge coupling constants and z p are theta term type of\ncouplings. All the couplings are allowed to depend on the superfield \u03c6. We shall\nassume that both u0 , u1 are symmetric in the gauge indices but this restriction\ncan be lifted.\nObserve that the action (7.8) is not an integral over the full \u039e2,1 superspace. Therefore it is not manifestly (2,1)-supersymmetric. The requirement of\ninvariance of the action under (2,1) supersymmetry imposes the conditions\nJ j i \u2202j u0ab = \u2212\u2202i u1ab\nJ j i \u2202j za1 = \u2212\u2202i za0 .\n29\n\n(7.9)\n\n\fTherefore the couplings u0 + iu1 and z 1 + iz 0 are holomorphic.\nIn addition gauge invariance of the action (7.8) implies that\nLa upbc = \u2212f dab updc \u2212 f d ac upbd\n\n(7.10)\n\nLa zbp = \u2212f dab zdp .\n\n7.5\n\nThe sigma model multiplet action and potential\n\nThe action of the (2,1)-supersymmetric gauged sigma model with Wess-Zumino\nterm has been given in [8]. Here we shall summarise some of results relevant to\nthis paper. The action of this multiplet is\nZ\n\u0001\nS\u03c3 = d2 xd\u03b80+ d\u03b8\u2212 gij \u22070+ \u03c6i \u2207\u2212 \u03c6j + \u03bda W1a\nZ\n(7.11)\n\u0001\n+ d2 xdtd\u03b8+ d\u03b8\u2212 Hijk \u2202t \u03c6i \u22070+ \u03c6j \u2207\u2212 \u03c6k \u2212 wia \u2202t \u03c6i W\u2212a\nThis action can be written without the t integration as\nZ\nS\u03c3 = d2 xd\u03b8+ d\u03b8\u2212 gij \u2207+ \u03c6i \u2207\u2212 \u03c6j + bij D+ \u03c6i D\u2212 \u03c6j\ni\n\u2212 Aa+ wia D\u2212 \u03c6i \u2212 Aa\u2212 wia D+ \u03c6j + Aa\u2212 Ab+ \u03be[b\nwa]i\n\n(7.12)\n\u0001\n\nGauge invariance of the above action requires that w should satisfy the\nconditions described in section 2.2. As in the case of (2,0)-supersymmetric\ngauged sigma model, it is also required that \u03bd is globally defined and La \u03bdb =\n\u2212fab c \u03bdc . In fact \u03bd is a moment map associated with the action of the gauge\ngroup on the KT manifold M .\nThe part of the action involving the potential is\nZ\nSp = d2 xd\u03b80+ d\u03b8\u2212 h ,\n(7.13)\nwhere h = h(\u03c6) Invariance under (2,1) supersymmetry requires that\n\u2202i h = J k i \u2202k h1\n\n(7.14)\n\nwhere h1 = h1 (\u03c6). This implies that h is the real part of a holomorphic function\non M .\nThe scalar potential of (2,1)-supersymmetric gauge theories coupled to sigma\nmodels described above is\nV =\n\n1\n1 ab\nu0 (\u03bda + za1 )(\u03bdb + zb1 ) + g ij (\u2202i h + \u2202i zap Wpa )(\u2202j h + +\u2202j zap Wpa ) . (7.15)\n4\n4\n\n30\n\n\f7.6\n\nA generalisation\n\nAs we have shown both the (2,1) gauge multiplet and the (2,1) sigma model\nmultiplet are constructed from covariantly chiral scalar superfields, ie both satisfy the conditions (7.5) and (7.3). Because of this, these two superfields can\nbe combined to a single superfield Z = (W0 , W1 , \u03c6) which is a map from the\n(2, 1) superspace \u039e2,1 into (LG \u2297 R2 ) \u00d7 M . In addition we can take Z to satisfy\na chirality condition which is the combination of (7.3) and (7.5). Next we can\ntake the gauge group G to act on (LG \u2297 R2 ) \u00d7 M with the adjoint action in\nthe first factor and a group action on M . The vector fields associated by such\na group action are\n\u03bea =\n\nX\n\nf c ab Wpb\n\np\n\n\u2202\n+ \u03be i \u2202i .\n\u2202Wpc\n\n(7.16)\n\nTreating the (2,1)-supersymmetric gauge theory coupled to sigma model\nmatter as a sigma model with superfield Z, which satisfies (7.3) and (7.5), we\ncan write the action\nZ\n\u0001\nS\u03c3 = d2 xd\u03b80+ d\u03b8\u2212 gAB \u22070+ Z A \u2207\u2212 Z B + \u03bda W1a + h\nZ\n\u0001 (7.17)\n+ d2 xdtd\u03b8+ d\u03b8\u2212 HABC \u2202t Z A \u22070+ Z B \u2207\u2212 Z C \u2212 wBa \u2202t Z B W\u2212a\nwhere now all the couplings are defined using the geometry of (LG \u2297 R2 ) \u00d7 M .\nOf course (2,1)-supersymmetric requires that (LG \u2297 R2 ) \u00d7 M is a KT manifold\nwith respect to the complex structure (J, id \u2297 \u01eb). In particular the metric and\nthe rest of the couplings depend on the coordinates of (LG \u2297 R2 ) \u00d7 M . The\nconditions for gauge invariance are easily determined from those of the (2,1)supersymmetric gauged sigma model. We remark that the couplings of (7.17)\ncan be arranged such that the SO(2) R-symmetry of the (2, 1)-supersymmetry\nalgebra is broken. In particular the SO(2) rotation that rotate the Wp scalar\ncomponents is not a symmetry of the action. However if one insists in preserving\nthe R-symmetry, then the KT manifold (LG \u2297 R2 ) \u00d7 M should admit a SO(2)\naction preserving all the geometric data.\n\n8\n8.1\n\n(4, 1) supersymmetry\nThe gauge multiplet\n\n+ , x= , \u03b8 + , \u03b8 \u2212 ), where (x+\n+ , x= )\nThe (4, 1) superspace \u039e4,1 has coordinates (x+\np\n\u2212 +\nare the even and {\u03b8 , \u03b8p , p = 0, . . . , 3} are the odd coordinates. The (4,1)supersymmetric Yang-Mills multiplet is described by a connection A in \u039e4,1\nsuperspace with components (A+\n+ , A= , Ap+ , A\u2212 ) with p = 0, . . . 3.

Some\nof the conditions on these superfields given in (8.1), like in the (2,1) model\npreviously, can be expressed as conditions of a (4,1) sigma model multiplet.\nFor this, view the four-scalar superfields {Wp : p = 0, 1, 2, 3} as maps from\nthe superspace \u039e4,1 into LG \u2297 R4 , where LG is the Lie algebra of the gauge\ngroup G. Then introduce three constant complex structures {Ir } in R4 such\nthat (Ir )0 s = \u03b4rs and (Ir )s t = \u2212\u01ebrst where r, s, t = 1, 2, 3. The conditions on\nWp in (8.1) and (8.1) can be expressed as\n\u2207r+ Wpa = Ir q p \u22070+ Wqa .\n\n(8.3)\n\nThe components of the gauge multiplet are\nWp = Wp |\n\nF+\n+= = \u22070+ \u2207\u2212 W0 |\n\n\u03c7p\u2212 = \u2207\u2212 Wp |\n\n\u03c7p+ = \u22070+ Wp |\n\n(8.4)\n\nfr = \u22070+ \u2207\u2212 Wr | r = 1, 2, 3 ,\nwhere Wp are scalars, \u03c7p+ ,\u03c7p\u2212 are the gaugini which are real chiral fermions\nin two dimensions, F+\n+= is the field strength and {fr : r = 1, 2, 3} are auxiliary\nfields. The SO(4) R-symmetry of the (4,1)-supersymmetric gauge theory rotates\nboth the scalars and the fermions of the gauge multiplet.\n\n8.2\n\nThe sigma model multiplet\n\nLet M be a HKT manifold with metric g and hypercomplex structure {Jr ; r =\n1, 2, 3}. We in addition assume that the gauge group G acts on M with\nisometries which in addition preserve the hypercomplex structure Jr and the\nWess-Zumino term H. These conditions are the same as in the case of (4,0)supersymmetric model. The (4,1) sigma model superfield \u03c6 is a map from the\n(4,1) superspace \u039e4,1 into the sigma model manifold M . In addition it is required that\n\u2207r+ \u03c6i = Jr i j \u22070+ \u03c6j ,\n32\n\n(8.5)\n\n\fwhere \u2207p+ \u03c6i = Dp+ \u03c6i +Aap+ \u03beai and \u03be are the vector fields on M generated by the\ngroup action. As we have seen the (4,1) gauge multiplet satisfies the condition\n(8.3) similar to (8.5). These results will be used later for the construction of\nactions of (4,1)-supersymmetric gauge theories coupled to sigma models.\nThe components of the sigma model (4,1) multiplet \u03c6 are as follows,\n\u03c6i = \u03c6i |\n\nli = \u22070+ \u2207\u2212 \u03c6i |\n\n\u03bbi+ = \u22070+ \u03c6i |\n\n\u03bbi\u2212 = \u2207\u2212 \u03c6i | ,\n\n(8.6)\n\nwhere \u03c6 is a scalar, \u03bb+ and \u03bb\u2212 are real fermions, and l is an auxiliary field.\n\n8.3\n\nAction\n\nThe action of a (4,1)-supersymmetric gauged theory coupled to sigma model\nmatter can be written as\nS = Sg + S\u03c3 + Sp ,\n\n(8.7)\n\nwhere Sg is the action of the gauge multiplet, S\u03c3 is the action of the sigma-model\nmultiplet and Sp is the potential. We shall describe each term separately.\n\n8.4\n\nThe gauge multiplet action\n\nAn action for the (4,1)-supersymmetric gauge multiplet is\nZ\nSg = d2 xd\u03b80+ \u2212 u0ab \u03b4 pq \u22070+ Wpa \u2207\u2212 Wqb\n+ urab \u03b4 pq \u2207r+ Wpa \u2207\u2212 Wqb + zap Wpa\n\n(8.8)\n\u0001\n\nwhere {up } = {u0 , ur } and z p are the gauge coupling constants and theta type\nof terms, respectively, which in general depend on the superfield \u03c6. We shall\nassume that both up are symmetric in the gauge indices but this restriction can\nbe lifted.\nObserve that this action is not an integral over the full \u039e4,1 superspace.\nTherefore it is not manifestly (4,1)-supersymmetric. The requirement of invariance under (4,1) supersymmetry imposes the condition that up and z p are\nconstant. This is similar to the condition that arises in (4,0) supersymmetric\ngauge theories. In addition, gauge invariance of the action (8.8) requires that\nf d ab updc + f d ac upbd = 0\nf d ab zdp = 0 .\n\n(8.9)\n\nThus up must be invariant quadratic forms on the Lie algebra of the group G\nand z p must be invariant elements of the Lie algebra.

In addition we can take Z to satisfy a\ncondition which is the combination of (8.5) and (8.3). Next we can take the\ngauge group G to act on (LG \u2297 R4 ) \u00d7 M with the adjoint action in the first\nfactor and a group action on M . The vector fields associated by such a group\naction are\nX\n\u2202\n\u03bea =\nf c ab Wpb\n+ \u03be i \u2202i .\n(8.14)\nc\n\u2202W\np\np\n34\n\n\fTreating the (4,1)-supersymmetric gauge theory coupled to sigma model\nmatter as a sigma model with superfield Z, which satisfies (8.3) and (8.5), we\ncan write the action\nZ\nX\n\u0001\nS\u03c3 = d2 xd\u03b80+ d\u03b8\u2212 gAB \u22070+ Z A \u2207\u2212 Z B +\n\u03bdar Wra + h\nr\n\n+\n\nZ\n\n2\n\n+\n\nd xdtd\u03b8 d\u03b8\n\n\u2212\n\nA\n\nB\n\n(8.15)\n\nC\n\nHABC \u2202t Z \u22070+ Z \u2207\u2212 Z \u2212 wBa \u2202t Z\n\nB\n\nW\u2212a\n\n\u0001\n\nwhere now all the couplings are defined using the geometry of (LG \u2297 R4 ) \u00d7 M .\nOf course (4,1)-supersymmetry requires that (LG \u2297 R4 ) \u00d7 M is a HKT manifold\nwith respect to the hypercomplex structure (Jr , Ir ). In particular the metric\nand the rest of the couplings depend on the coordinates of (LG \u2297 R4 ) \u00d7 M . The\nconditions for gauge invariance are easily determined from those of the (4,1)supersymmetric gauged sigma model. We remark that the couplings of (8.15)\ncan be arranged such that the SO(4) R-symmetry of the (4, 1)-supersymmetry\nalgebra is broken. In particular the SO(4) rotation that rotates the Wp scalar\ncomponents is not a symmetry of the action. However if one insists in preserving\nthe R-symmetry, then the HKT manifold (LG \u2297 R4 ) \u00d7 M should admit a SO(4)\naction preserving all the geometric data.\n\n9\n\nA bound for vortices in the (2,0) model\n\nVortices are the instantons of two-dimensional gauge theories coupled to sigma\nmodels. Bogomol'nyi type of bounds for both abelian [20] and non-abelian\nvortices [21, 22] have been investigated in the context of linear sigma models.\nHere we shall establish bounds for vortices for non-linear sigma models. For\nthis we shall consider the Euclidean action of the (2,0)-supersymmetric gauge\nsigma model without Wess-Zumino term. The sigma model target space M\nis K\u00e4hler with metric g, complex structure J and associated K\u00e4hler form \u03a9J\n((\u03a9J )ij = gik J k j ). After a Wick rotation the two-dimensional spacetime is R2\nwith the standard Euclidean metric. The relevant part of the bosonic Euclidean\naction of a (2,0)-supersymmetric gauge theory coupled to a sigma model is\nZ\n\u0001\n1\n1\n1\na\nb \u03bc\u03bb \u03bd\u03c1\nd2 x gij \u03b4 \u03bc\u03bd \u2207\u03bc \u03c6i \u2207\u03bd \u03c6j + uab F\u03bc\u03bd\nSE =\nF\u03bb\u03c1\n\u03b4 \u03b4 + uab \u03bda \u03bdb . (9.1)\n2\n2\n4\n2\nR\nNext we introduce I a constant complex structure on R2 such that R2 is a\nK\u00e4hler manifold. The associated K\u00e4hler form \u03a9I is the volume form of R2 . In\nsuch a case the Euclidean action (9.1) can be rewritten as\nZ\n\u00021\n1\n1\nSE = d2 x uab (\u03a9I * F a \u2213 \u03bd a )(\u03a9I * F b \u2213 \u03bd b )\n4\n2\n2\n1\n\u03bc\u03bd \u03c1\ni\nk i\n\u03c3\n(9.2)\n+ gij \u03b4 (I \u03bc \u2207\u03c1 \u03c6 \u2213 \u2207\u03bc \u03c6 J k )(I \u03bd \u2207\u03c3 \u03c6j \u2213 \u2207\u03bd \u03c6l J j l )]\nZ4\n((\u03a9J )ij \u2207\u03c6i \u2227 \u2207\u03c6j + \u03bda F a )\n\n\u00b1\n\nR2\n\n35\n\n\fwhere \u03a9I * F = (\u03a9I )\u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd , \u03bd a = uab \u03bdb , uab = u0ab and uac ucb = \u03b4 a b (uab =\nu(ab) ). We remark that the above expression for the Euclidean action has been\nconstructed from (9.1) by completing squares and collecting all the remaining\nterms which organise themselves in the last term of (9.2).\nThe last term in (9.2),\nZ\nQ=\n\u03c9J ,\n(9.3)\nR2\n\nis a topological charge, where the form\n\u03c9J = (\u03a9J )ij \u2207\u03c6i \u2227 \u2207\u03c6j + \u03bda F a\n\n(9.4)\n\nis the equivariant extension of the K\u00e4hler form \u03a9J of the sigma model target\nspace M . The form \u03c9J is closed. Viewing \u03c9J as form on R2 , it is apparent. In\nfact \u03c9J is closed as a two-form on any manifold N for any map \u03c6 from N into\nthe sigma model manifold M and for any choice of connection A. This can be\neasily seen and we shall not demonstrate it here.\nThe Euclidean action of the (2,0)-supersymmetric two-dimensional gauge\ntheory coupled to a sigma model is bounded by the absolute value of the topological charge Q, SE \u2265 |Q|. This is because it is always possible to choose the\nsigns in the Bogomol'nyi bound above such that the topological term is positive.\nIf the topological charge is positive, then the bound is attained whenever\n\u03a9I * F a \u2212 \u03bd a = 0\nJ i j \u2207\u03bc \u03c6j \u2212 \u2207\u03bd \u03c6i I \u03bd \u03bc = 0 .\n\n(9.5)\n\nIn two-dimensions, the curvature F is a (1,1)-form. Choosing complex coordinates (z, z\u0304) on R2 with respect to the complex structure I, it is always possible\nto arrange using a (complex) gauge transformation that Az\u0304 = 0. Choosing complex coordinates in the sigma model target space M as well, it is easy to see\nthat the second BPS condition implies that the map \u03c6 is holomorphic from the\nspacetime R2 into the sigma model manifold M .\nA special case of this bound arises for gauge theories couple to linear sigma\nmodels for which the sigma model manifold M = R2n with the Euclidean metric and equipped with a constant compatible complex structure J. This case\nincludes the Nielsen-Olesen vortices [19]. (For these, existence of a solution was\nshown in [23] and the moduli were studied in [30], [21] and more recently in [31],\nsee also [32]). The case with a single complex scalar has been analysed in [20].\nChoosing complex coordinates {q \u03b1 ; \u03b1 = 1, . . . , n} in R2n , we write\nX\nds2 =\ndq \u03b1 dq \u1fb1\n\u03b1\n\n\u03a9J = \u2212i\n\nX\n\ndq \u03b1 \u2227 dq \u1fb1 .\n\n\u03b1\n\n36\n\n(9.6)\n\n\fNext consider the abelian group U (1)-action q \u03b1 \u2192 eiQ\u03b1 t q \u03b1 which generates the\nholomorphic Killing vector fields\nX\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u03be=i\nQ\u03b1 (q \u03b1 \u03b1 \u2212 q \u1fb1 \u1fb1 ) .\n(9.7)\n\u2202q\n\u2202q\n\u03b1\nThe moment map is\n\u03bd=\u2212\n\nX\n(Q\u03b1 q \u03b1 q \u1fb1 ) \u2212 \u039b ,\n\n(9.8)\n\n\u03b1\n\nwhere \u039b is a (cosmological) constant. This is an example of a (2, 0)-supersymmetric\ngauged linear sigma model with gauge group U (1) of the type considered in [5].\nThe topological charge is\nZ\nX\n\u0001\nQ=\nd2 z\n\u03b1(\u2207z q \u03b1 \u2207z\u0304 q \u1fb1 \u2212 \u2207z\u0304 q \u03b1 \u2207z q \u1fb1 ) + \u03bdFzz\u0304\n(9.9)\nR2\n\n\u03b1\n\nwhere \u2207z q = \u2202z q + iAz Q\u03b1 q \u03b1 , \u2207z q \u1fb1 = \u2202z q \u1fb1 \u2212 iAz Q\u03b1 q \u1fb1 , \u2207z\u0304 q \u1fb1 = (\u2207z q \u03b1 )\u2217 and\n\u2207z\u0304 q \u03b1 = (\u2207z q \u1fb1 )\u2217 , and Fzz\u0304 = \u2202z Az\u0304 \u2212 \u2202z\u0304 Az . To compare the bound above (9.2)\nwith that of vortices in [5], we observe that after some integration by parts we\nhave\nZ\nX\n\u0001\n(9.10)\nQ\u03b1 (\u2202z q \u03b1 \u2202z\u0304 q \u1fb1 \u2212 \u2202z\u0304 q \u03b1 \u2202z q \u1fb1 ) \u2212 \u039bFzz\u0304 + surfaces\nd2 z\nQ=\nR2\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\nThe first term in the above expression is the topological charge expected for\nthe vortices (instantons) of ungauged two-dimensional sigma models. The same\ntopological charge also appears in the kink solitons of three-dimensional nonlinear sigma models. The last part in the above expression involving the cosmological constant and the Maxwell field is the usual degree of an abelian vortex.\nThe relation between the topological charge Q in (9.9) and the degree of an\nabelian vortex involves integration by parts. Under certain boundary conditions the two topological charges are the same. However as we have shown, the\nbound that involves the equivariant extension of the K\u00e4hler form generalizes in\nthe context of gauge theories coupled to non-linear sigma models.\n\n10\n\nA bound for vortices in the (4,0) model\n\nA bound similar to the one we have described in the previous section for the\nEuclidean action of (2,0)-supersymmetric gauge theory coupled to sigma model\nmatter can also be found for the Euclidean action of (4,0)-supersymmetric gauge\ntheory.

(The inner products are\ntaken with respect to the Riemannian metrics h and g.) The rest of the notation\nis self-explanatory. We remark that if \u03a9J represents the first Chern class of a\nline bundle, i.e. the K\u00e4hler manifold is Hodge, then \u03c9J can be thought of as the\nequivariant extension of the first Chern class (see [9]).\nIf uab is a constant invariant quadratic form on the Lie algebra of the gauge\ngroup G, it is clear that the functional SE is bounded by a topological term\n39\n\n\fQ which involves the equivariant extension of the K\u00e4hler form and the second\nChern character of the bundle P \u00d7G L(G), where P is a principal bundle of\nthe gauge group G and G acts on L(G) with the adjoint representation. In\nparticular we can write\nZ\n\u00021\n\u0003\n1\ndvol(N ) |\u03a9I * F \u2213 \u03bd|2 + |F 2,0 |2 + |I\u2207\u03c6 \u2213 J\u2207\u03c6|2\nSE =\n4\n4\nN\n(11.4)\nZ\nZ\n1\n8\u03c0 2\nk\u22121\nk\u22122\n\u00b1\n\u03c9 J \u2227 \u03a9I \u2212\nch2 \u2227 \u03a9I ,\n(k \u2212 1)!

It is worth pointing\nout that the term involving the second Chern character is not affected by the\nchoice of sign in writing (11.2). Therefore there are three cases to consider the\nfollowing: (i) there is no choice of sign such that the topological charge Q is\npositive. In such a case the bound cannot be attained. (ii) There is a critical\ncase in which for one choice of sign the topological charge is negative while for\nthe other choice is zero. This case implies that the Euclidean action vanishes\nand so every term should vanish. Solutions exist for F = \u2207\u03c6 = \u03bd = 0. (iii) For\none of the choice of signs the topological charge is positive. Suppose that Q is\npositive in (11.2) for the first choice of sign. In such case the bound is attained\nprovided that the equations\nF 2,0 = 0\n\u03a9I * F a \u2212 \u03bd a = 0\nI\n\n\u03bd\n\ni\n\n\u03bc \u2207\u03bd \u03c6\n\ni\n\n(11.5)\n\nj\n\n\u2212 J j \u2207\u03bc \u03c6 = 0\n\nhold. The first equation implies that F is a (1,1)-form. The last equation in\n(11.5) implies that the maps \u03c6 are holomorphic. Finally the middle equations\nare a generalization of non-abelian vortex equations. If the term involving the\nmoment map is constant, then the resulting equation is the Hermitian-Einstein\nequation.\n\n12\n\nHyper-K\u00e4hler manifolds and non-abelian vortices\n\nLet (N, h, I) be a K\u00e4hler manifold of dimension 2k with associated K\u00e4hler form\n\u03a9I and (M, g, Jr ) be a hyper-K\u00e4hler manifold of dimension 4n with associated\nK\u00e4hler forms \u03a9Jr .

The rest of the notation\nis self-explanatory.\nIt is clear that the functional SE is bounded by a topological charge Q\nwhich involves the equivariant extensions of the K\u00e4hler forms \u03a9Jr and, if u is a\nconstant invariant quadratic form on L(G), the second Chern character of the\ngauge bundle P \u00d7G L(G). It is worth pointing out that the term involving the\nsecond Chern character is not affected by the choice of sign in writing (12.2).\nTherefore as in the K\u00e4hler case, there are several cases to consider but we shall\nnot repeat the analysis again. Suppose that both Q and that the inner product\nof the vector {ar : r = 1, 2, 3} with {Q\u0303r : r = 1, 2, 3} are positive in (12.2),\nwhere\nZ\n1\nQ\u0303r =\n(12.4)\n\u03c9J \u2227 \u03a9Ik\u22121 .\n(k \u2212 1)! N r\nThen the bound is attained provided that the equations\nF 2,0 = 0\na\n\nar \u03a9I F \u2212 \u03bdra = 0\n\n(12.5)\n\nar I \u03bd \u03bc \u2207\u03bd \u03c6i \u2212 Jr i j \u2207\u03bc \u03c6j = 0\nhold. The first equation implies that F is a (1,1)-form. It is always possible\nwith a rotation in the space of complex structures of the hyper-K\u00e4hler manifold\nM to set a1 = 1 and a2 = a3 = 0. Then last equation in (12.5) implies that\n\u2207\u03bc \u03c6i = 0 .\n\n(12.6)\n\na i\nF\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bea = 0 .\n\n(12.7)\n\nThis in turn implies that\n\n41\n\n\fTherefore either the connection A is flat or the maps \u03c6 take values in the fixed\nset Mf of the G-group action on M . In the former case, in the absence of nontrivial flat connections, the moduli space of solutions to these equations is the\nhyper-K\u00e4hler reduction M//G of G and it is a smooth manifold provided that\nthe level set does not intersect Mf . In the latter case, the maps \u03c6 are constant\nand the two remaining equations in (12.5) are the Hermitian-Einstein equations\nfor the connection A.\nOne can also consider the case where (N, h, Ir ) is a hyper-K\u00e4hler manifold\nwhile (M, g, J) is a K\u00e4hler manifold which admits a G-holomorphic action of\nisometries. This case can be treated as that considered in the previous section involving only K\u00e4hler manifolds. A K\u00e4hler structure on N can chosen\nwith respect to any complex structure which lies in the two-sphere of complex\nstructures of N .\n\n13\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nWe have constructed the actions of two-dimensional (p,0)- and (p,1)-supersymmetric\ngauge theories coupled to sigma model matter with Wess-Zumino term. We have\nalso given the scalar potentials of these theories. Our method of constructing\nthese theories relies on a superfield method. Then we have shown that the Euclidean actions these theories admit vortex type of bounds which generalise to\nhigher dimensions.\nThe gauge theories that we have constructed are not the most general ones.\nIt is known for example that the (1,1)-supersymmetric sigma model admits a\nscalar potential which is the length of a killing vector field [33]. Our superfield\nmethod cannot describe such a term. There are also other possibilities, for example the sigma models with almost complex manifolds as a target space as\nwell as those associated with (p, 0) fermionic multiplets for which the supersymmetry algebra closes on-shell [16, 29]. Other models of interest that we have not\ndescribed here are those with (p, 2), p = 2, 4, and (4,4) supersymmetry. All the\nabove models can be described using (1,0) superfields. This method has been\nused before, see [12, 13, 14]. This means that the action of such models can\nbe written in terms of (1,0) superfields and the additional supersymmetries can\nbe implemented by requiring invariance of the action under additional suitable\ntransformations. The (2,2) and (4,4) supersymmetric gauge theories have been\ndescribed using other methods in [5] and [34].\nThe gauge theories coupled to sigma models which we have described with\n(p, 1) supersymmetry have soliton type of bounds in addition to the vortex type\nof bounds that we have described. For the former bounds the energy of these\nmodels can be written as a sum of squares and a topological term. This is\nvery similar to bounds of (ungauged) sigma models [24] and so we have not\ndescribed them here. It would be of interest to investigate the solutions of the\nvortex equations we have presented for different types of moment maps. It may\nbe that for a suitable choice, the vortex equations can be solved exactly.\n\n42\n\n\fAcknowledgements We would like to thank D. Tong and P. Townsend for useful discussions.
