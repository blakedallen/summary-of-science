An\nargument relating this time scale to the diffusion constant of the noisy traveling wave leads to a\nprediction for \u03b1 which agrees with our simulations. An exactly soluble case gives trees with statistics\nidentical to those predicted for mean-field spin glasses by Parisi's theory.\n\nTraveling wave equations such as the F-KPP equation\n\u2202t h = \u2202x2 h+ h\u2212 h2 [1, 2, 3] describe how a stable medium\nh = 1 invades an unstable medium h = 0. They were first\nintroduced to study how an advantageous gene propagates through a population, h being the fraction of the\npopulation with the advantageous gene. They also appear in other contexts such as disordered systems [4, 5, 6],\nQCD [7], reaction-diffusion [8, 9], fragmentation [10] or\nchemistry [11].\nTraveling wave equations often represent a mean field\npicture where the fluctuations at the microscopic scale\nare ignored. The effect of these fluctuations can be\nrepresented [9, 11, 12,\u221a13, 14] by a noise term (\u2202t h =\n\u2202x2 h + h \u2212 h2 + \u01eb\u03b7(x, t) h \u2212 h2 ). Determining quantitatively the effect of a weak noise (\u01eb \u226a 1) on the front\nposition is a subject of active research. There is increasing evidence that the dynamics of the position of\nthe front is dominated by the fluctuations near its tip\n[15, 16, 17] and that there is a shift in the velocity of the\nfront [8, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22], logarithmic in the amplitude\n\u01eb of the noise, as predicted by a simple cut-off theory [23].\nIn the present letter, we consider models of an evolving\npopulation under selection, which can be described by\nnoisy traveling wave equations. Instead of focusing on the\ntime dependence of the position of the front, we look at\nthe problem from a different perspective: we determine\nhow coalescence times in the genealogy depend on the\nsize of the population. Our simulations as well as a simple\nargument indicate that these coalescence times scale as\nthe inverse of the diffusion constant of the front.\nWe consider a population of fixed size N with asexual\nreproduction. Each individual i is characterized by a real\nnumber xi measuring its adequacy to the environment,\nand the population is fully specified by these N positions\nxi 's on the adequacy axis. At each new generation, all\nthe individuals disappear after giving birth to some offsprings. We consider the following variants:\nIn Model A, each individual gives birth to k offsprings, and the j-th offspring of individual i is at position xi +\u01ebi,j , where the \u01ebi,j are uncorrelated random numbers chosen according to some distribution \u03c1(\u01eb). Thus,\neach individual inherits its parent's adequacy, and \u01ebi,j\n\naccounts for the effects of mutation. Then comes the selection step: out of the kN new individuals, we only keep\nthe N best ones, the ones with the highest xi 's. Typically,\nwe will take k = 2 and \u03c1(\u01eb) uniform between 0 and 1.\nA similar model was proposed recently [16, 24, 25, 26]\nto study the evolution under competitive selection of a\npopulation of DNA molecules in vitro. The population\nundergoes several cycles where, in the first part of a cycle, each molecule is amplified by a fixed number k with\npossible mutations and in the second part of the cycle\nselection acts by keeping only the best 1/k fraction of\nthese offsprings, defined as the molecules with the highest binding energies to a given target. In this picture, xi\nrepresents this binding energy.\nWe also investigate Model A' where, instead of keeping the N best individuals at each generation, we keep\nN individuals randomly chosen among the (3/2)N best\nones. This allows us to check that our results remain\nunchanged under a less stringent selection.\nIn Model B, each individual i has infinitely many offsprings, with positions distributed according to a Poisson\npoint process of density \u03c8(x \u2212 xi ) (i.e., with probability \u03c8(x \u2212 xi ) dx, there is an offspring of individual i at\nposition x). As in Model A, we only keep the N best\nRoffsprings. Here, \u03c8(\u01eb) is a positive function such that\n\u03c8(\u01eb)d\u01eb = \u221e (for the population not to disappear) and\nwhich decays fast enough as \u01eb \u2192 \u221e to ensure that these\nbest offsprings have finite positions. Having infinitely\nmany offsprings at the first step is of course unrealistic,\nbut after selection, each individual has only a finite number of offsprings. The main two reasons for considering\nModel B are to check the robustness of our results and\nto exhibit an exactly soluble case for one particular \u03c8(\u01eb).\nThe genealogical tree of an evolving population can be\ncharacterized in many ways [27, 28]. Here we measure\naverage coalescence times hTp i defined as follows: Tp is\nthe age of the most recent common ancestor of p individuals chosen at random at generation g, and hTp i is the\naverage of Tp over all choices of these p individuals and\nover all generations g.\nIn absence of selection (for example when each individual has k offsprings as in model A, but with N survivors\n\n\f2\n\n1000\n\nModel A', k = 2, uniform density\nModel A, k = 2, uniform density\nModel B, \u03c8(\u01eb) = \u03b8(\u2212\u01eb)\nModel B, \u03c8(\u01eb) = (\u2212\u01eb)3 \u03b8(\u2212\u01eb)\nModel B, \u03c8(\u01eb) = exp(\u2212\u01eb)\n\u221d (ln N )3 and \u221d (ln N )2\n\u221d (ln N ) and \u221d (ln N ).75\n\n1.5\n\nneutral\n\n1.45\n\nhT4 i\nhT2 i\n\n1.4\n\nexponential\n\n100\n\n1.35\nneutral\n\n10\n102\n\n103\n\n104\n\n105\n\nFIG. 1: Times hT2 i versus N , for different models.

We measured\nthe times hTp i by recording at each generation g the age\nT2 (i, j) of the most recent common ancestor of individuals i and j. One then gets hT2 i by averaging T2 (i, j)\nover i, j and g. As the matrix T2 (i, j) is ultrametric,\nno additional information is needed to compute the hTp i:\nfor instance, T3 (i, j, k) = max[T2 (i, j), T2 (i, k)]. For large\nsizes N , we actually took advantage of ultrametricity by\nrepresenting the matrix T2 (i, j) as a tree: at each step,\nwe only kept track of the current N individuals and of all\nthe most recent common ancestors of any pair of them.\nThere are at most N \u2212 1 such ancestors, so both memory\nand execution time grow linearly with N , instead of N 2\nif we were manipulating the full matrix.\n\n1.3\n\nhT3 i\nhT2 i\n\n1.25\n\nexponential\n102\n\n103\n\n104\n\n105\n\n106\n\nFIG. 2: Ratios hT3 i/hT2 i and hT4 i/hT2 i versus N , for the\nsame models (same symbols) as in Fig. 1. The dashed lines\nrepresent the the neutral case Eq. (1), and the dotted lines\ncorrespond to Eq. (3), i.e. model B with \u03c8(\u01eb) = e\u2212\u01eb .\n\nIn all cases except for model B with the exponential\ndistribution, which is special as we shall see below, Fig. 1\nindicates that the exponent \u03b1 defined in Eq. (2) is in the\nrange\n2. \u2264 \u03b1measured \u2264 3.\n\n(4)\n\nFor model B with the exponential distribution, however,\nour data suggest a significantly smaller value .75 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 1.\nFig. 2 shows the ratios hT3 i/hT2 i and hT4 i/hT2 i for\nthe same models as in Fig. 1. In all cases, including\nmodel B with \u03c8(\u01eb) = e\u2212\u01eb , these ratios take for large\nN values similar to Eq. (3) which differ noticeably from\ntheir values (1) in absence of selection. At present, we\ndo not have a general theory to explain this numerical\nresult.\nOnly for model B with \u03c8(\u01eb) = e\u2212\u01eb (the special case),\none can calculate these ratios exactly using a method similar to [5]. If at generation g, the population consists of\nN individuals x1 (g), . . . , xN (g), the probability of having\none of their offsprings in the interval y, y + dy is\nN\nX\ni=1\n\nN\nX\n\u0001\nexi (g)\u2212y dy = eXg \u2212y dy\n\u03c8 y \u2212 xi (g) dy =\ni=1\n\nwhere\nh\ni\nXg = ln ex1 (g) + ex2 (g) + * * * + exN (g)\nSo, for model B with \u03c8(\u01eb) = e\u2212\u01eb , the offsprings of the\nwhole population are the same as those of a single effective individual at position Xg . This means that one can\nwrite xi (g + 1) = Xg + yi , where y1 , y2 , ..., yN are the N\nlargest values of a Poisson point process on the line with\nexponential density. The yi 's are therefore distributed\naccording to\nP(yN < yN \u22121 < * * * < y1 ) = e\u2212(y1 +y2 +***+yN )\u2212e\n\n\u2212yN\n\n(5)\n\n\f3\nWith this simplification, one can see that the differences \u2206Xg = Xg+1 \u2212 Xg are independent identically distributed random variables. At generation g, the N numbers xi (g) form a cloud of points which does not spread in\ntime, very much like a quantum N -particle bound state.\nThis cloud has a well defined velocity vN and diffusion\nconstant DN . As the differences \u2206Xg are independent,\nvN and DN are given by:\nvN = h\u2206Xg i ;\n\nDN = h[\u2206Xg ]2 i \u2212 h\u2206Xg i2\n\nwhere the expectations are over the distribution (5) of\nthe yi 's and\n\u2206Xg = Xg+1 \u2212 Xg = ln [ey1 + ... + eyn ]\nCalculations similar to those of [5] lead for large N to\nvN = ln ln N +\n\nln ln N + 1\n\u03c02\n+* * * ; DN =\n+* * * (6)\nln N\n3 ln N\n\nWe now turn to computing hTp i in the exponential\ncase. If one chooses randomly p \u2265 2 individuals at generation g + 1, one can calculate the probability qp that\nthey have the same ancestor at generation g\n\u001c P pyi \u001d\ne\n1\n1\n+ ***\n(7)\nqp = Pi yi p \u2243\n[ ie ]\np \u2212 1 ln N\n\nOne can also show that for large N and fixed p, events\nwith more than one coalescence within the p individuals\nbetween two successive generations have a probability of\norder (ln N )\u22122 at most. Thus, for large N , the genealogical tree of a sample of p individuals consists of single\ncoalescence events separated by times of order ln N .\nFrom the knowledge of the qp 's, one can obtain for large\nN the probability rp (k) that p individuals at generation\ng + 1 have exactly k < p ancestors at generation g:\nrp (k) =\n\nk\u22121\nX\nj=0\n\n(\u2212)j\u2212k+1 p!\nqp\u2212j\nj!(k \u2212 1 \u2212 j)!(p \u2212 k + 1)!\n\n(8)\n\n1\np\n+ ***\n=\n(p \u2212 k)(p \u2212 k + 1) ln N\nand one has\nhTp i = 1 + hTp i +\n\nX\n\nk<p\n\nrp (k) [hTk i \u2212 hTp i]\n\n(9)\n\nUsing the fact that hT1 i = 0 this immediately gives\nhT2 i \u2243 ln N\n\n(10)\n\n(in reasonable agreement with our simulations of Fig. 1)\nand all the ratios hTn i/hT2 i. For n = 3 and 4, this gives\nEq. (3) which is therefore asymptotically exact in the\nexponential case.\nWe now return to the general case. Our models are\nbranching processes which are known to be related to\n\nfronts of the F-KPP type [33]. Let us now see how one\ncan associate to model B a noisy traveling wave equation\n(a similar calculation can be done for model A). At generation g the whole population can be characterized by a\nfunction hg (x) which counts the fraction of individuals i\nsuch that xi (g) > x. Obviously hg (x) has the shape of a\nfront (hg (\u2212\u221e) = 1 and hg (\u221e) = 0). From the definition\nof model B, one can show that hg (x) satisfies\n\u0014 Z\n\u0015\n\u03b7g (x)\nhg+1 (x) = min 1, hg (x \u2212 \u01eb)\u03c8(\u01eb)d\u01eb + \u221a\n(11)\nN\nwhere \u03b7g (x) is some correlated noise of zero-mean with a\nvariance equal to the integral appearing in Eq. (11). One\ncan show as in [5] that this noise is Gaussian far from the\ntip of the front.\nIn the large N limit, Eq. (11) becomes deterministic.\nOne can look for traveling wave solutions moving at a\nvelocity v. In the region where h \u226a 1, an exponential\nshape hg (x) \u2243 A exp[\u2212\u03b3(x \u2212 vg)] is a solution if\n\u0014Z\n\u0015\n1\ne\u03b3\u01eb \u03c8(\u01eb)d\u01eb\n(12)\nv = v(\u03b3) = ln\n\u03b3\nIf the front is of the F-KPP type [3], its velocity for steep\nenough initial conditions is the smallest one for which\n\u03b3 is real. Furthermore, for finite but large N , one expects [15, 17, 34] a correction to this velocity of order\n[ln N ]\u22122 and a diffusion constant scaling like [ln N ]\u22123 .\nWe have checked that these predictions are compatible\nwith our numerical simulations for all the models that we\ntested when v(\u03b3) has a minimum value (all the models\nof Figs. 1, 2 except the exponential case have this property). For other choices such as \u03c8(\u01eb) = exp(\u2212\u01eb), however,\nv(\u03b3) = \u221e for all \u03b3, and the front is not of the F-KPP\ntype. It is therefore not surprising that the genealogy of\nthe exponential case is special.\nIn all cases, the times hT2 i or hTp i give the order of\nmagnitude of the age of the most recent common ancestor\nof the whole population and, therefore, the time scale on\nwhich the population looses memory about its genealogy.\nNow, the position of this most recent common ancestor\nhas fluctuations of order 1, and this contributes a random\nshift of order 1 to the displacement of front. Therefore,\nthe fluctuating part of the position at generation g is the\nsum of roughly g/hT2 i independent random variables of\norder 1. Within this picture, the diffusion constant but\nalso all the cumulants of the position would scale like\nDN \u223c 1/hT2 i \u223c 1/hTp i .\n\n(13)\n\nThat all cumulants have the same large N dependence\nwas indeed one of the main results of our previous work\n[17]. Note that Eq. (13) does hold (Eqs. (6) and (10)) in\nthe exponential case. Assuming that it remains valid in\ngeneral, we would then predict\n\u03b1prediction = 3\n\n(14)\n\n\f4\nsince there is now good numerical evidence [15, 34] as well\nas analytic arguments [17] in favor of DN \u2243 [ln N ]\u22123 in\nthe generic case, i.e. if v(\u03b3) has a finite minimum. We\nthink that this prediction agrees with our measurements\n(4) up to finite size corrections: in fact, for the diffusion\nconstant itself, it already turned out [15, 17, 34] that the\nlarge N asymptotic regime was only observed for much\nlarger systems than the ones studied here.\nBeyond the fact that the time scale is logarithmic in N ,\nwhich is not surprising for models of evolution in presence\nof strong selection [35, 36, 37], the times hTp i are characteristic of the statistical properties of the genalogical\ntrees of samples of a few individuals. For the exponential model, these statistics are totally specified by the fact\nthat there is at most one single coalescence event at each\ngeneration with probability Eq. (7). Surprisingly, these\ncoalescence probabilities (up to the factor ln N which\nfixes the time-scale) are the same as those which emerged\nfrom the theory of spin-glasses [28, 31, 32], so that trees,\nin the exponential model B here, have exactly the same\nstatistics as the ultrametric trees of Parisi's mean-field\ntheory of spin-glasses [38, 39]. So far we have not been\nable to develop a replica approach for noisy traveling\nwaves to justify this connection. There is however some\nhope to do so since noisy traveling waves appear in the\nstudy of directed polymers in a random medium [5], a\nsystem for which Parisi's theory is known to be valid at\nthe mean-field level [4].\nThe numerical data presented in this paper show that,\nfor the class of models we considered, selection has drastic effects on the genealogies: the coalescence times become logarithmic in the population size (2) instead of\nlinear and the statistics of the coalesence times are modified. The accuracy of our simulations is not sufficient\nto be sure that the exponent \u03b1 and the ratios of coalescence times are universal (for all models for which v(\u03b3)\nhas a finite minimum). We however gave an argument\n(13) which supports the conjecture (14). Of course, developing an analytical approach susceptible of proving or\ndisproving this universality is a challenging open problem. Another open issue is whether thinking in terms\nof genealogies is limited to the family of selection models discussed here or could be extended to more general\nnoisy traveling wave equations.\nLastly, it would be interesting to know what our ratios\n(3) would become in other models of evolution with selection such as [40, 41] and if there is a chance of estimating\nthem from experimental data on genetic diversity.\nThis work was partially supported by the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\n[1] R.
