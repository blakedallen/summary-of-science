General covariance ordinarily implies that the divergence of the\nmatter energy-momentum tensor Tab vanishes when the\nmatter field satisfies its equation of motion. This is\nrequired for consistency of the Einstein field equation1\nGab = 8\u03c0GTab , since the divergence of the Einstein tensor Gab is identically zero by virtue of the contracted\nBianchi identity. If a fixed preferred frame is introduced\ninto the matter action, for example, general covariance is\nlost, Tab is not divergenceless, and the Einstein equation\nis inconsistent. We therefore seek to incorporate the preferred frame while preserving general covariance, which\nrequires that the preferred frame be dynamical.\nIt would be most appealing if the preferred frame were\nsomehow determined by the spacetime metric itself. As\ndiscussed below, in spacetimes with an initial singularity\nthe metric can be used to define a cosmological time function, the gradient of which then determines a preferred\nframe (which is by construction timelike). However, the\nnonlocal relationship between this frame and the metric\nresults in infinitely nonlocal field equations if this frame\nis incorporated into the action principle. Theories with\neven a finite amount of nonlocality are generally horribly\nunstable [1], so we do not consider this a viable approach.\nTo avoid such unacceptable behavior the preferred\nframe should arise from local conditions, which of course\nreflect conditions at earlier times but only through dynamics. For example, this dynamical frame could be\ndefined by a vector field [3,2,4,5] or by the gradient of\na scalar field [6,7]. In these approaches the presence or\nabsence of a preferred frame depends on the field configuration, since the preferred vector may vanish or may\nnot be timelike.\nSince our motivation arises from doubts about the fundamental validity of exact Lorentz invariance, we are\nnot interested in a theory possessing a Lorentz invariant phase. We wish to study instead an effective theory\nin which there is always a preferred frame. This frame\nis defined by a timelike direction or, equivalently, by a\nunit timelike (contravariant or covariant) vector field.2\nSuch a field carries a nonlinear representation of the local Lorentz group since the field takes values not in a\nvector space but on the unit hyperboloid in the tangent\n\nWe study a generally covariant model in which local\nLorentz invariance is broken by a dynamical unit timelike vector field ua -the \"aether\". Such a model makes it possible to\nstudy the gravitational and cosmological consequences of preferred frame effects, such as \"variable speed of light\" or high\nfrequency dispersion, while preserving a generally covariant\nmetric theory of gravity. In this paper we restrict attention\nto an action for an effective theory of the aether which involves only the antisymmetrized derivative \u2207[a ub] . Without\nmatter this theory is equivalent to a sector of the EinsteinMaxwell-charged dust system. The aether has two massless\ntransverse excitations, and the solutions of the model include\nall vacuum solutions of general relativity (as well as other\nsolutions). However, the aether generally develops gradient\nsingularities which signal a breakdown of this effective theory. Including the symmetrized derivative in the action for\nthe aether field may cure this problem.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Lorentz group is non-compact, since the boost parameter is unbounded. This makes exact Lorentz invariance impossible to test uniformly. Lorentz invariance has\nthus been tested only up to some maximum boost and beyond that lies an infinite volume of uncharted territory\nin the Lorentz group. Contrast this with the rotation\ngroup. Rotation invariance can be tested by filling in the\ncompact SO(3) group manifold more and more densely\nwith data points, or by checking a few randomly selected\nrotations. The rotation group can be and has been uniformly explored.\nThere is also reason to doubt exact Lorentz invariance:\nit leads to divergences in quantum field theory associated\nwith states of arbitrarily high energy and momentum.\nThis problem can be cured with a short distance cutoff\nwhich, however, breaks Lorentz invariance.\nFor these reasons we entertain the possibility that there\nis a preferred rest frame at each spacetime point. In particular, we seek a viable effective field theory incorporating a breaking of local Lorentz invariance.\nIf the preferred frame were to be a fixed external structure, then it would violate general covariance, which\nwould require us to abandon general relativity (or any\n\n1\n\nWe use units with c = 1 and the metric signature (+\u2212\u2212\u2212).\nA unit timelike vector contains a discrete piece of information that a frame by itself does not have, namely, a time\norientation. The theory may or may not depend on this\norientation.\n2\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\njacobson@physics.umd.edu\ndavemm@physics.umd.edu\n\n1\n\n\fory comprise a subset of the solutions to the coupled\nEinstein-Maxwell-charged dust equations. Several types\nof exact solutions to the field equations are characterized in section IV, and the linearized theory is studied\nin section V. Coupling of the preferred frame to matter\nfields is discussed in section VI. Both the dimension \u2264 4\ncouplings and some higher dimension ones are examined.\nThe paper concludes with a brief discussion in section\nVII.\nAmong the dimension > 4 couplings are included theories involving Lorentz non-invariant dispersion at high\nwavevectors. This is motivated by recent work in which\nhigh frequency dispersion is invoked to avoid the role of\ntrans-Planckian modes in the Hawking effect (for a review see [14]). In this framework such theories can be\nformulated in a generally covariant manner so that gravitational effects can be consistently incorporated. Higher\ndimension couplings also also provide an alternative generally covariant formulation of variable speed of light\nmodels, in which different fields propagate at different\nspeeds possibly at different cosmological epochs. Such\nmodels have recently been of interest as potential alternatives to standard cosmology, and have been given generally covariant formulations using additional fields to\ndefine the preferred frame [5\u20137].\n\nspace. This could therefore be called a theory of nonlinearly realized Lorentz invariance. It is analogous to a\ngauge theory with a non-linear sigma model Higgs field\nof fixed norm [8,9]. There seems to be no generally accepted terminology for this sort of symmetry structure.\nSince the symmetry breaking unit vector field is not a\nstate-dependent expectation value but rather breaks this\nsymmetry in all states, it may be misleading to say the\nsymmetry is \"spontaneously broken\". For lack of a better idea we shall take refuge in ambiguity and just call it\n\"broken\". What this really means is that in order to implement the local Lorentz symmetry one must transform\nnot only the matter fields but also the background unit\nvector, so for practical purposes it will appear as what\nwould normally be called broken Lorentz symmetry.\nThe theory described here was devised about a decade\nago by J.C. Dell together with one of us [10], and we have\nsince learned that similar ideas have independently been\nstudied previously. The non-gravitational part of the theory (and generalizations thereof) was considered by Dirac\n[11] in the early 1950's as a new theory of electrons (in\nwhich the unit timelike vector played the dual role of\ngauge-fixed vector potential and flow vector of a stream\nof charged dust). A class of generally covariant theories breaking Lorentz invariance was studied by Gasperini\n[12] in many papers. In this work the tetrad formalism\nwas used, and the local Lorentz symmetry was broken by\nincluding in the action terms referring to a fixed \"internal\" unit timelike vector. This is equivalent to our formulation in terms of the metric and a unit timelike vector.\nTo see the equivalence, note that the tetrad defines a\nmetric and associates to the fixed internal vector a unit\nvector field on spacetime. The only other information in\nthe tetrad is the gauge freedom parametrized by the local\nrotations leaving invariant the preferred timelike vector.\nEliminating this gauge freedom leads to the formalism\nused in this paper. Gasperini has studied both cosmological and central field solutions, with various choices\nfor the specific form of the second derivative terms in the\nLagrangian. In the present paper we focus on a different\nLagrangian.\nThe particular Lagrangian studied here was also considered by Kosteleck\u00fd and Samuel [13], as a simplified\nmodel of the spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking\nthat might occur in string theory, although in Ref. [13]\nthe preferred vector was not necessarily timelike. More\ngenerally, those authors argued that spontaneous Lorentz\nsymmetry breaking in string theory may produce vacuum\nexpectation values of more than one tensor field. In this\ncase, rather than having just a single \"preferred frame\"\nthere might be several background Lorentz tensors which\ncollectively break part or all of the Lorentz symmetry.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.\nIn section II we explain the nonlocality problem encountered if a cosmological time is used to define the preferred\nframe. In section III our proposed field theory of a preferred frame is formulated and its general properties are\ninvestigated. It is seen that the solutions for our the-\n\nII. COSMOLOGICAL TIMES\n\nIn this section we briefly describe the construction of\na cosmological time function determined purely by the\nmetric, and the reason for rejecting it for the purposes of\nan effective theory of local Lorentz symmetry breaking.\nThe cosmological metric of our universe, by virtue of\nits (approximate) homogeneity, (approximately) defines\na preferred spacelike foliation of spacetime. However,\nthis particular definition of the time function relies on\nthe symmetry of the spacetime. For a workable theory\nwith general covariance what is needed is a definition\nof cosmological time that can be used independently of\nsymmetry.\nIt is difficult to think of a notion of cosmological time\nthat would make sense for all possible cosmologies. However, if we restrict attention to spacetimes with a \"beginning\", then two notions of cosmological time at x present\nthemselves: (i) volume time, the spacetime volume (or\nperhaps the fourth root thereof) of the past set I \u2212 [x],\nand (ii) maximal time, the maximal proper time along a\ncausal curve going back to the initial singularity.3 Other\n\n3\n\nThe maximal time function has been discussed in Refs.\n[15\u201317]. In particular, a powerful theorem proved in Ref.\n[17] establishes a number of properties of this function under\nthe further assumption that the initial singularity is the only\nplace past directed causal curves can end.\n\n2\n\n\fspacetime admits a globally defined unit timelike vector\nfield which is the case if and only if the spacetime is time\norientable.\n\npossibilities are combinations or smoothed averages of\nthese times. Both of these time functions are determined\nnon-locally but causally by the spacetime to the past of\nx. They may or may not be sufficiently smooth functions\nto enter meaningfully into a local action principle.4 If we\nassume that they are indeed sufficiently smooth we find\nthat there is in any case a fatal problem with using them\nin this manner, as will now be explained.\nSuppose that to the usual action for gravity and matter\nfields is added a term involving one of the above cosmological times,\nS = Slocal + S\u03c4 .\n\nA. Action\n\nThe most general Lagrangian involving the metric and\nthe aether with two or fewer derivatives is, up to a total\ndivergence,\nLg,u = a0 \u2212 a1 R \u2212 a2 Rab ua ub\n\n(2.1)\n\n\u2212b1 F ab Fab \u2212 b2 (\u2207a ub )(\u2207a ub ) \u2212 b3 u\u0307a u\u0307a ,\n\nWe assume that the equations of motion are obtained\nas usual by requiring that the action is stationary with\nrespect to variations of the fields.

[18] as the most general Lagrangian for a vectortensor theory of gravity including terms up to second\norder in derivatives and quadratic in the vector field. The\ndifferences are that (i) the terms u2 and Ru2 are missing\nfrom our action since the vector field is constrained to\nbe a unit vector, and (ii) we have included the quartic\nterm b3 u\u03072 , which was omitted in Ref. [18] because it is\nnot quadratic in ua . [19] Note that, even without the last\nterm, our theory is not a special case of the vector-tensor\ntheories discussed in Ref. [18], since the constraint u2 = 1\naffects the field equations.\nThe coefficient a0 in the action (3.1) has mass dimension 4 while a1,2 and b1,2,3 have mass dimension 2. Lacking the underlying fundamental theory we do not try to\nassign a priori the values of these coefficients. A partial\nanalysis of the observational consequences and limits on\nthem has been done for the vector-tensor theories [18],\nhowever that analysis does not apply directly to our case\ndue to the presence of the constraint term. It is fairly\nclear nevertheless that whatever values b1,2,3 take, agreement with observation will require that a2 \u226a a1 , and\nthat a0 /a1 (which is basically the cosmological constant)\nmust not be much larger than the squared Hubble constant.\nIn this initial foray we shall restrict attention to the\nsimple case in which the only terms with non-zero coefficients are R and F 2 . That is, we set a0 = a2 = b2 =\nb3 = 0. The minimal theory we consider is thus defined\nby the action\nZ\n\u221a\nSmin [gab , ua , \u03bb] = d4 x \u2212g\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2212a1 R \u2212 b1 F ab Fab + \u03bb(gab ua ub \u2212 1) .\n(3.3)\n\n(2.2)\nwhere the prime on \u03b4 \u2032 indicates that the metric dependence of \u03c4 (x) is not included in the variation. Since\n\u03b4\u03c4 (x\u2032 )/\u03b4gab (x) has support when x\u2032 lies to the future of\nx, the field equation \u03b4S/\u03b4gab (x) = 0 involves the values of the fields to the future of x. Indeed the metric\nfield equation is infinitely non-local in time, since the\ntime function at any point to the future can be affected\nby a metric variation at x. Even finite nonlocality in\ntime leads to unphysical instability [1], so this approach\nto incorporating a preferred frame must be rejected. If\nthe action depends on \u03c4 only through its derivative \u2207a \u03c4 ,\nthen the equation of motion would be causal if \u03b4\u2207c \u03c4 (x\u2032 )\ndepended only on gab (x) at x = x\u2032 . However, this is not\nthe case for the either the volume time or the maximal\ntime.\nIII. AETHER DYNAMICS\n\nWe now turn to a class of theories in which there is a\npreferred frame which is determined by a local field. It\nis convenient to give a name to this field, and \"aether\"\nseems as good a name as any. Let us take the aether field\nto be a unit timelike vector field ua , which is dimensionless, like the metric. To handle the condition that ua is\na unit vector, we include in the action a Lagrange multiplier term. Note that we are implicitly assuming that the\n\n4\n\nOne of the results of the theorem of Ref. [17] referred to\nin the previous footnote is that the maximal time function\nis locally Lipschitz and its first and second derivatives exist\nalmost everywhere. The volume time function may well be\neven better behaved.\n\n3\n\n\fThis minimal theory is one of the models considered by\nKosteleck\u00fd and Samuel [13] in the paper mentioned in\nsection I. Those authors studied a broader class of models in which ua is not necessarily constrained to be a\nunit vector but rather possesses a Lorentz-invariant potential energy with a minimum at some fixed value of\nua ua . They also allowed for extra, compact spatial dimensions of spacetime, and examined cases where the\nsymmetry breaking vector lies in the extra dimensions as\nwell as cases where it lies in the four ordinary spacetime\ndimensions. Our paper by contrast is restricted to four\ndimensions and to a timelike vector of fixed norm. Later\nin this paper we shall also add matter terms to the action, including terms which couple the aether field to the\nmatter.\nNote that Fab is invariant under the \"gauge transformation\"\nua \u2192 ua + \u2207a f,\n\nterm and the constraint term in the action. (The constraint equation (3.9) has been used to drop the contribution\n\u221a to (3.7) that would have come from the variation of\n\u2212g in the constraint term.) The contribution from the\nconstraint term looks like that of a (pressureless) dust\nwith rest energy density 2\u03bb, and that from the F 2 term\nis the usual Maxwell tensor familiar from electromagnetism, if we identify the vector potential as\np\n\"Am \" \u2194 2 b1 um .\n(3.10)\nThe stress tensor thus satisfies the usual energy conditions provided b1 /a1 and \u03bb/a1 are positive.\nIn terms of the vector potential Am (3.10) the constraint equation (3.9) becomes\nAm Am = 4b1\n\nwhich can be interpreted as a gauge condition. The\naether field equation (3.8) becomes the Maxwell equation\nwith source equal to the current of a charged\u221adust fluid\nwith 4-velocity ub and charge density \u2212(\u03bb/ b1 ). The\nevolution of \u03bb is determined by the current conservation\nequation which follows from divergence of the aether field\nequation (3.8) upon using the identity \u2207a \u2207b F ab \u2261 0.\nThus \u03bb satisfies a first order ordinary differential equation along the flow lines of ua :\n\n(3.4)\n\nhowever the constraint u2 = 1 does not share this\nsymmetry (nor do the additional couplings in general),\nso the theory is certainly not \"gauge invariant\". The\nconstraint does have a limited version of this symmetry however, namely for those functions f satisfying\n(ua + \u2207a f )(ua + \u2207a f ) = ua ua = 1. The general solution\nto this equation is\np\nua \u2207a f = \u22121 \u00b1 1 + q ab \u2207a f \u2207b f ,\n(3.5)\n\nua \u2207a \u03bb = \u2212\u03bb \u2207a ua .\n\n(3.6)\n\nis the (positive definite) spatial metric orthogonal to ua .\nThus the action (3.3) is invariant under the gauge transformation (3.4) if f is chosen arbitrarily on a spacelike\nsurface and then determined uniquely elsewhere (up to a\ndiscrete choice of sign) by integration of (3.5) along the\nflow of ua .\n\nRelation to Einstein-Maxwell-charged dust system\n\nWe have just seen that the field equations of the minimal theory take the form of the coupled Einstein-Maxwell\nequations, with a charged\u221a\ndust matter source possessing\ncharge to mass ratio \u22121/2 b1 . There is no explicit equation of motion for the dust, however the normalization\ncondition (3.9) provides such an equation. Taking the\ngradient of u2 = 1 we have\n\nB. Field equations\n\nThe equations of motion arising from the action (3.3)\nare\nGab\n\n2b1\n\u03bb\n=\u2212\n(Fam Fb m \u2212 41 F 2 gab ) + ua ub ,\na1\na1\n\u2207a F ab = \u2212\n\n\u03bb b\nu ,\n2b1\n\ngab ua ub = 1.\n\n(3.12)\n\nIn particular, if \u03bb vanishes on a Cauchy surface, it must\nvanish everywhere. Also, the sign of \u03bb on a given flow\nline cannot change, since if \u03bb = 0 at any point on a flow\nline it must vanish everywhere on that line.\n\nwhere\nqab := \u2212gab + ua ub\n\n(3.11)\n\n0 = \u2207a (ub ub )\n= 2ub \u2207a ub\n= 2(ub \u2207b ua + ub Fab ).\n\u221a\nLet us define F\u0303ab = 2\u2202[a Ab] = 2 b1 Fab . Then\nbecomes\n\n(3.7)\n\n(3.8)\n\n1\nub \u2207b ua = \u2212 \u221a F\u0303ab ub ,\n2 b1\n\n(3.9)\n\n(3.13)\n(3.14)\n(3.15)\n(3.15)\n\n(3.16)\n\nwhich is the equation of motion for a particle in the\nelectromagnetic\nfield F\u0303ab , with charge to mass ratio\n\u221a\n\u22121/2 b1 , the same ratio we inferred from the Einstein\n\nThe metric equation (3.7) has the form of the Einstein\nequation Gab = 8\u03c0G Tab , where G = 1/16\u03c0a1 , and the\nstress tensor receives contributions from both the F 2\n4\n\n\fand Maxwell equations! Thus any solution of our minimal theory is a solution of the Einstein-Maxwell-charged\ndust equations (although the converse is not true). The\nequivalence to a subset of the charged dust solutions\ndemonstrates that the equations of our theory admit an\ninitial value formulation, and it provides some useful intuition about the nature of the solutions.\nOur theory is not equivalent to the Einstein-Maxwellcharged dust system because in the general solution of\nthat system the dust 4-velocity is not proportional to\nthe vector potential in some gauge. That is, although\nthere \u221a\nis always a gauge transformation that will make\nAm /2 b1 a unit vector, it cannot in general be made to\ncoincide with the dust 4-velocity.5\n\nAnother way to think of this construction is in terms of\nthe congruence of integral curves of ua . When Fab = 0,\neqn. (3.15) implies that these curves are geodesics. Moreover, if ua is the unit tangent field to a congruence of\ngeodesics, then Fab = 2\u2207[a ub] = 0 if and only if the\ncongruence is hypersurface-orthogonal. Hence the general solution of this type is just an arbitrary solution to\nthe Einstein equation, together with ua given by the unit\ntangent field of any hypersurface-orthogonal congruence\nof timelike geodesics in this metric. A special case is flat\nspacetime, where the ua congruence consists of straight\nlines normal to an arbitrary initial spacelike hypersurface.\nSingular aether evolution\n\nIV. SOLUTIONS\n\nThis characterization of the Fab = 0 solutions shows\nthat, at least for such solutions, the evolution of ua is generally singular. The geodesics launched normally from a\nspacelike surface will typically cross. Where they do, the\nquantity \u2207a ub will diverge.\nThe existence of such singular evolutions for ua signals\na breakdown of the effective theory we are using. Perhaps\nit would be cured by including the term (\u2207(a ub) )(\u2207(a ub) )\nin the action. (Without this term the action is insensitive to gradients for which the antisymmetrized derivative \u2207[a ub] vanishes.) For the purposes of the present\npaper we shall not pursue this question, but it should be\naddressed.\n\nIn this section we characterize a few types of solutions\nto the field equations.\nA. Solutions with \u03bb = 0\n\nIf \u03bb = 0, then the two field equations (3.7,3.8) are just\nthe Einstein-Maxwell equations. Any solution to these\nequations is a solution in our theory provided a gauge\ncan be chosen so that the constraint equation (3.11) is\nsatisfied. Such a gauge always exists, at least locally.\nB. Solutions with Fab = 0\n\nCosmological solutions\n\nA special class of solutions to the field equations with\n\u03bb = 0 are those with Fab = 0. For such fields, (3.8)\nimplies that \u03bb = 0, and the field equations (3.7-3.9) reduce to the ordinary vacuum Einstein equation together\nwith the constraint u2 = 1. When Fab = 0 it follows, at\nleast locally, that ua = \u2207a \u03c4 for some function \u03c4 , and the\nconstraint then implies that \u2207a \u03c4 \u2207a \u03c4 = 1. The general\nsolution for such a function \u03c4 can specified by assigning\nthe value \u03c4 = 0 to an arbitrary spacelike surface, and\ndetermining \u03c4 elsewhere by \"uniform normal extension\",\ni.e. by the differential equation na \u2207a \u03c4 = 1, where na is\nthe unit normal to the surface.\n\nIf ua shares the symmetry of a homogeneous isotropic\ncosmological metric, then Fab = 0. The presence of the\naether field therefore has no influence on the cosmological\nevolution unless there are additional terms in the action\nbeyond the minimal model. In Ref. [20] we examine some\ncosmological effects of coupling to a scalar field though a\nfourth spatial derivative term as discussed in Sect. VI B.\nBlack hole solutions\n\nFor a spherically symmetric black hole, a suitable congruence of geodesics is given by the radial free-fall trajectories that all have the same Killing energy, i.e. the\nsame asymptotic velocity at spatial infinity. The same\nconstruction can even be applied in the case of a Kerr\nblack hole, at least for the geodesics that are at rest at\nspatial infinity. This follows from the work of Ref. [21], in\nwhich this congruence is employed to construct a coordinate system for the Kerr metric using the time function\n\u03c4 mentioned above.\n\n5\nThe general form of the discrepancy between these two 4vectors was found by Dirac (see the second paper of Ref. [11]),\nwho showed that (in four spacetime\ndimensions) there is al\u221a\nways a gauge in which Am /2 b1 = um + \u03be\u2207m \u03b7, where \u03be and\n\u03b7 are functions that are constant along the flow lines of ua .\nDirac included the functions \u03be and \u03b7 as dynamical variables in\norder to obtain a theory in which arbitrary electron streams\nwere admitted. In the third paper of Ref. [11] he allowed for\nmultiple streams.\n\n5\n\n\f(4.1)), so that At = A\u2032t + \u03b2 and Ar = A\u2032r + \u03b3,r . The\nnormalization (3.11) then implies\nq \u0002\n\u0003\n\u03b3,r = \u2212A\u2032r \u00b1 g tt g tt (A\u2032t + \u03b2)2 \u2212 4b1 ,\n(4.6)\n\nC. Spherically symmetric, static solutions\n\nHere we seek to characterize the general spherically\nsymmetric, static solution. We shall find that, besides\nthe mass, the metric in these solutions has an additional\nfree parameter, the \"aether charge\".\nSome of the linearized static, spherically symmetric solutions were previously studied in Ref. [13]. Those authors examined the case where ua is spacelike, and while\nin four spacetime dimensions they restricted attention\nto vanishing Lagrange multiplier \u03bb and vanishing field\nstrength Fab . In the present work we treat the nonlinear case, considering only timelike ua and imposing no\nfurther restrictions on the fields.\nCoordinates can be chosen so the line element takes\nthe form\nds2 = gtt dt2 + grr dr2 \u2212 r2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 ),\n\nwhere we have used the fact that for the ReissnerNordstrom metrics grr = \u22121/gtt . In any region where\ng tt and At are bounded one can always choose \u03b2 large\nenough so that the radical is real, and then \u03b3(r) can be\nfound by integration.\nIf a horizon is present g tt diverges and it is not clear\nfrom the preceding discussion whether the unit timelike\ngauge can be accessed in a smooth way across the horizon. Indeed it can, however the maximal extension of\nthe region over which such a gauge can be accessed depends on the parameter b1 . This can also be understood\nfrom the equivalence with a charged dust solution. The\nradial congruence ua must satisfy the Lorentz force equation (3.16), and this congruence can be nonsingular and\ntime-independent only if the trajectories are monotonic\nin the r coordinate. In general, however, the trajectories\nbounce inside the black hole.\n\n(4.1)\n\nand the aether field takes the form\nu = ut (r)dt + ur (r)dr.\n\n(4.2)\n\nThe only potentially nonzero component of Fab is then\nFrt = \u2202r ut , and the constraint (3.9) implies\ng tt u2t + g rr u2r = 1.\n\nComparison with observation\n\n(4.3)\nTo compare with observation it would be necessary\nto determine which of the above solutions to use in the\npresence of a spherically symmetric static source such as\na planet, star, or black hole. The metric associated with\none of these objects depends on its \"aether charge\" -\nthe charge of the Reissner-Nordstrom solution-which is\ndetermined by the \"charge\" of the \"aether dust\" that fell\nin when the object condensed. The choice is determined\nby the initial conditions on \u03bb, which are presumably cosmological in origin. We have no theory of these initial\nconditions at this stage, but agreement with observations\ncan put a bound on the amount of aether charge. If this\ncharge is zero, then we have the usual Schwarzschild solution of general relativity (and, as discussed in section\nIV B, the aether field is the tangent field to a hypersurface orthogonal congruence of timelike geodesics), which\nof course agrees with observations.\n\nThe aether field equation (3.8) in coordinate form\nreads\n\u0001\n\u221a\n1\n\u03bb \u03b2\n\u221a \u2202\u03b1\n\u2212gg \u03b1\u03bc g \u03b2\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212\nu ,\n\u2212g\n2b1\n\n(4.4)\n\nor, taking into account the form of the metric (4.1),\n\u0001\n\u221a\n1\n\u03bb\n\u221a \u2202r\n\u2212gg rr g \u03b2t Frt = \u2212 u\u03b2 .\n\u2212g\nb1\n\n(4.5)\n\nThe left hand side vanishes when \u03b2 = r, hence the field\nequation implies that \u03bbur = 0, which in turn implies\nthat either ur = 0 or \u03bb = 0. In the former case, ua is\nproportional to the timelike Killing field itself. There are\nthus two cases to consider.\nIf \u03bb 6= 0 there are in fact no static solutions, unless\nthe coefficients in the action are such that the charge\nto mass ratio of the dust is extremal. Recall that any\nsolution to our theory is a solution to the charged dust\ntheory. However under the influence of gravitational and\nelectric forces, the non-extremal charged dust cannot remain static, since there is no pressure [22,23].\nIf \u03bb = 0 then (cf. Sect. IV A) these are just the spherically symmetric static Einstein-Maxwell solutions, i.e.\nthe Reissner-Nordstrom solutions, in a spherically symmetric, static gauge with fixed norm (3.11). Such a gauge\nalways exists, at least locally. Consider the gauge transform A\u03bc = A\u2032\u03bc + \u03b1,\u03bc of an arbitrary vector potential A\u2032\u03bc .\nTo maintain spherical symmetry and time independence\nwe must have \u03b1 = \u03b2t + \u03b3(r) (using the coordinates in\n\nV. LINEARIZED THEORY\n\nIn this section we study the linearized equations defined by expanding about a background solution,\n(0)\n\ngab = gab + hab\n\n(5.1)\n\nu(0)\na\n(0)\n\n(5.2)\n\nua =\n\n\u03bb=\u03bb\n\n+ va ,\n(1)\n\n+\u03bb\n\n.\n\n(5.3)\n(0)\n\nFor the background we take the flat metric gab = \u03b7ab\n(0)\nand a constant ua . In this background solution the\n6\n\n\fequations of motion imply that the Lagrange multiplier\n\u03bb(0) must vanish, hence we shall use the letter \u03bb for the\nperturbation \u03bb(1) . In this section we use the flat background metric to raise and lower indices. Note that we\nuse the perturbation of the covariant vector ua to define\nthe perturbation va .\nWe choose cartesian coordinates (x0 , xi ), i = 1, 2, 3, in\nwhich the components of \u03b7ab are diag(1, \u22121, \u22121, \u22121) and\n(0)\nthose of ua are (1, 0, 0, 0). The linearized field equations for this theory were first written down in a general gauge in Ref. [13], who also pointed out that the\nLorentz gauge can be accessed using the linearized diffeomorphism invariance of the action. The Lorentz gauge\ncondition for the metric perturbation is h\u0304ab ,b = 0, where\nh\u0304ab \u2261 hab \u2212 12 h\u03b7ab is the trace-reversed metric perturbation. In this gauge, the linearized equations of motion\nare\n2h\u0304ab = 2\n\n\u03bb (0) (0)\nu u\na1 a b\n\n2vb \u2212 \u2202b (\u2202 a va ) = \u2212\n\n\u03bb (0)\nu\n2b1 b\n\n\u2212 hab u(0)a u(0)b + 2u(0)b vb = 0\n\n\u2212 \u22072 v0 \u2212 \u22020 (\u2202 i vi ) = \u2212\n2vi \u2212 \u2202i (\u2202 j vj ) = 0.\n\n(5.9)\n(5.10)\n\nLet us decompose vi into transverse and longitudinal\nparts, vi = viT + viL , where \u2202 i viT = 0 and viL = \u2202i f for\nsome scalar field f . Then (5.10) implies that the transverse part satisfies the wave equation, 2viT = 0, so the\nthe aether field has two transverse massless modes.\nAs for the longitudinal part viL , equation (5.9) implies\n\u22020 (\u2202 i viL ) =\n\nb 1 \u2212 a1 2\n\u2207 h00 ,\n2b1\n\n(5.11)\n\nso in particular viL has at most linear time dependence.\n(The same conclusion follows from the divergence of Eq.\n(5.10).) Thus viL = \u2202i a(x) t + \u2202i b(x), where a(x) is determined by h00 and b(x) is arbitrary.\nIn summary, the perturbation spectrum consists of two\nmassless transverse traceless modes of h\u0304ij , and two massless transverse modes of vi . In addition there is a mode\nin which h00 is an arbitrarily specified time-independent\nfunction, which determines v0 , \u03bb, and the time derivative\nof the longitudinal part viL . The time-independent part\nof viL is also arbitrary. This last freedom corresponds to\nthe linearization of the restricted gauge symmetry (3.5).\nThe longitudinal mode looks very strange at first sight.\nIn the charged dust interpretation, the dust energy density is adjusted to produce an arbitrary gravitational potential h00 , and the perturbed metric, electromagnetic\nfield, and charge density are all time independent, while\nthe perturbed dust world lines are time dependent. This\nis a peculiarity of the first order perturbative solution\nhowever. No exact solution shares this property, as can\nbe easily seen from the aether field equation (3.8). If\nthe left hand side is invariant with respect to a timelike Killing field, and if \u03bb is also invariant, then so must\nbe ub . Evidently the higher order terms in the equations of motion induce time dependence into the solution.\nA similar phenomenon can be seen upon expanding the\nsimpler Einstein-neutral dust system about the flat space\nsolution with constant dust 4-velocity and vanishing density. As in our case, the dust density perturbation can\nset up any static metric perturbation, and the linearized\ngeodesic equation for the dust yields a time-dependent\ndust velocity perturbation.\n\n(5.4)\n\n(5.5)\n\n(5.6)\n\nIn a source-free region, the residual gauge freedom is\nusually employed to set h\u03040i = h0i = 0 and h\u0304 = \u2212h = 0.\n[24] The possibility of doing so depends on the fact that\nthese quantities satisfy the wave equation in general relativity. In our case, the components h0i satisfy the wave\nequation, however h does not, due to the source term on\nthe right hand side of (5.4) that is always present (even\noutside matter) unless \u03bb = 0. This source corresponds\nto the energy density of the \"charged dust\", and we wish\nto allow for the presence of this term. Therefore, rather\nthan setting h to zero, we choose to set to zero the trace of\nthe spatial part, h\u0304ii , which does satisfy the wave equation.\nThe proof that this can be done follows the same logic as\nin the usual case. This gauge condition implies h\u0304 = h\u030400 ,\nhence h00 = h\u030400 \u2212 12 h\u0304\u03b700 = 21 h\u030400 , and the Lorentz gauge\ncondition implies \u22020 h\u030400 = 0 and \u2202i h\u0304ij = 0. Thus h00 is\ntime-independent and the spatial part h\u0304ij is a transverse\ntraceless solution to the wave equation. This is not quite\nthe same as the usual transverse traceless gauge in general relativity however, since hij = h\u0304ij \u2212 h00 \u03b4ij , so hij is\nnot transverse unless \u2202i h00 = 0, and h = \u22122h00 6= 0.\nIt remains to consider the linearized equations for h00 ,\nva , and \u03bb. The 00-component of the metric equation\n(5.4) and the constraint equation (5.6) determine \u03bb and\nv0 in terms of h00 :\n\u03bb = \u2212a1 \u22072 h00\nv0 = \u2212 21 h00 .\n\n\u03bb\n2b1\n\nVI. MATTER COUPLINGS\n\nWe have so far considered only the terms in the action\ninvolving the metric and the aether field and up to two\nderivatives. Suppose a matter term Smat [gab , ua , \u03c8] is\nadded to the action Smin [gab , ua , \u03bb] of the minimal theory\n(3.3), where \u03c8 stands for a generic matter field. The\nvariation of Smat with respect to the metric produces an\nadditional contribution to the stress-energy tensor, and\nthe variation with respect to ua produces an additional\n\n(5.7)\n(5.8)\n\nUsing the time-independence of v0 , the time and space\ncomponents of the aether equation (5.5) read\n7\n\n\fterm in the current on the right hand side of (3.8). The\nresulting field equation takes the form\n1 \u03b4Smat \u0011\n1 \u0010\n.\n(6.1)\n\u03bbub +\n\u2207a Fab = \u2212\n2b1\n2 \u03b4ub\n\nwhich shows that now even if \u03bb is initially zero it need\nnot remain zero. In the presence of such matter couplings\nthe equivalence to charged dust is lost.\nWe now consider specific types of matter couplings,\nfirst of dimension less than or equal to four, and next of\ndimension greater than four.\n\nThe indices I, J in (6.3) are generational indices, and\nthe coupling constants (cL )IJ , cB , and c\u03a6 are all dimensionless. The ellipses in (6.3) stand for similar terms for\nthe other fermions, while those in (6.4) stand for similar\nterms for the other gauge fields.\nSuch additional kinetic terms modify the propagation\nspeed of the various fields. For example, the propagation\nspeed for the Higgs field, with respect to the preferred\nframe, is (1+c\u03a6 )\u22121/2 , which is less or more than the speed\nof light if c\u03a6 is positive or negative respectively. The\ncoupling constants must therefore be small numbers for\nfields whose propagator has been measured accurately.\nIt would be interesting to determine what limits can be\nplaced on these coefficients, particularly for fields such as\nthe Higgs or gluons whose propagators are presumably\nnot yet so well measured.\n\nA. Couplings of dimension \u2264 4\n\nB. Couplings of dimension > 4\n\nA complete classification of Lorentz violating, gaugeinvariant extensions of the SU(3)\u00d7SU(2)\u00d7U(1) minimal\nstandard model has been given by Colladay and Kosteleck\u00fd [25], restricting attention to operators whose mass\ndimension is less than or equal to four, so as to preserve\npower-counting renormalizability. This class of low energy effective actions includes both CP T -even and CP T odd terms, and involves various coupling tensors with\n\"generation\" indices allowing for mixing of fermions from\ndifferent generations. These coupling tensors are supposed to be Lorentz violating vacuum expectation values arising in a theory with a fundamental underlying\nLorentz symmetry.\nHere we consider the above class of Lorentz violating\nterms, keeping only those couplings that can be constructed with the aether field ua . With this restriction\nthe antisymmetric tensor couplings are excluded, which\nrules out Lorentz-violating Yukawa couplings and couplings of gauge field strengths to Higgs bilinears, and\nlimits the form of modifications of the gauge field kinetic\nterms. Invariance under time reversal ua \u2192 \u2212ua would\nbe required if the physical significance of the aether is\nonly to define a preferred frame and not a preferred local time orientation. If we accordingly further assume\nthis symmetry, all the CP T -odd terms are excluded,\nwhich rules out terms with a vector coupled to fermion or\nHiggs currents, gauge field Chern-Simons currents, and\nthe U(1) potential.\nThe only possibilities remaining after all these restrictions have been imposed are the modifications of the\nfermion, gauge field, and Higgs kinetic terms:\n\nOnce the restriction to terms of dimension 4 or less is\ndropped, the possibilities for Lorentz violating terms-\nlike those for Lorentz invariant ones-are endless. Here\nwe would like to consider just two types, which illustrate\ndifferent possibilities that arise in the presence of Lorentz\nsymmetry breaking.\n\nThe identity \u2207a \u2207b Fab = 0 then implies\n1\n\u03b4Smat\nua \u2207a \u03bb = \u2212\u03bb\u2207a ua \u2212 \u2207a\n,\n2\n\u03b4ua\n\na b\n1\n2 i(cL )IJ u u L\u0304I \u03b3a Db LJ\n\n+ h.c. + . . . ,\n\n(6.2)\n\nModified kinetic terms\n\nIf the coupling coefficient for a Lorentz violating kinetic term like (6.3-6.5) is field dependent and polynomial, rather than a constant, then the term is a dimension > 4 operator. In this case it is possible that the\ncoefficient was larger in the early universe than it is today, due to the cosmological evolution of the field(s) on\nwhich the coupling function depends. This provides an\nalternate approach to constructing generally covariant,\nvariable speed of light cosmologies. Approaches using a\nvector [5] or a scalar [6,7] to define the preferred frame\nhave been the subject of some recent papers.\nModified dispersion\n\nNext we consider a deviation from Lorentz invariance\nthat becomes strong only at high wavevectors. In the\nearly universe, when the fields were highly excited at\nlarge wavevectors, the gravitational effects of such a deviation could have been of paramount importance. The\nstudy of a model incorporating such effects is left to another paper [20]. Here we indicate only an example of\na term in the Lagrangian that produces high frequency\ndispersion in the propagation of a matter field, and we\ndisplay the the form of the resulting contribution to the\nenergy-momentum tensor.\n\n(6.3)\n\n\u2212 14 cB ua ub g mn Bam Bbn + . . . ,\n\n(6.4)\n\na b\n\u2020\n1\n2 c\u03a6 u u (Da \u03a6) Db \u03a6.\n\n(6.5)\n8\n\n\fConsequences of non-Lorentz invariant high frequency\ndispersion for the Hawking effect have previously been\nstudied using 1+1 dimensional model field theories in\nwhich higher spatial derivative terms are added to the\naction (for a review see [14]), and recently such models\nhave been generalized to field theory in the background of\na 3+1 dimensional Robertson-Walker spacetime in order\nto study the consequences for the spectrum of primordial\ndensity fluctuations in inflationary cosmology [26]. These\nmodels can be extended to an arbitrary 3+1 dimensional\nsetting, preserving general covariance as well as spatial\nrotation symmetry in the local preferred frame.

It is plausible that adding the\nsymmetrized derivative term will have a significant effect,\nsince with it the action is sensitive to the existence of any\nlarge gradients.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe are grateful to V.A.

DISCUSSION\n\nWe have made an initial attempt to study the possible consequences of incorporating a preferred frame-the\naether-into a generally covariant theory. With the action adopted in this paper the aether vector generically\ndevelops gradient singularities even when the metric is\nperfectly regular. We take this as a sign that the theory is unphysical as an effective theory (although if the\naether sector is ignored the theory can be made to agree\nwith observations with an appropriate choice of initial\nconditions, i.e. by setting Fab to zero.) The primary\nopen questions are (i) what determines the initial values\nof the aether field and the Lagrange multiplier field, and\n(ii) are the gradient singularities, which appear to be\n9\n\n\f[13] V.A.
