This\nmagnet consists of spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chains weakly coupled by a frustrated antiferromagnetic\ninteraction:\n)\n(\nX\nX\n(1)\nJk Sj,n * Sj+1,n +\n[Jr (n, n + \u03bc)Sj,n + Jd (n, n + \u03bc) (Sj+1,n + Sj\u22121,n )] * Sj,n+\u03bc ,\nH=\n\u03bc=\u00b11\n\nj,n\n\nwhere Sj,n are spin-1/2 operators, and Jk >> Jr , Jd > 0. The interaction pattern of this model resembles the flag\nof American Confederation which gave the model its name. Fractional quantum number excitations appear when\nJr (n, n + \u03bc) = 2Jd (n, n + \u03bc). If this condition is fulfilled, the interaction between staggered components of the\nmagnetization on chains n and n + \u03bc vanishes. The weakness of the interchain coupling allows us to employ the\ncontinuous description. In the continuum limit each Heisenberg chain is represented by the SU1 (2) Wess-ZuminoNovikov-Witten (WZNW) model and the relevant part of the interchain interaction is reduced to the interaction of\nspin currents with different chirality:\nH=\n\n\u0015\nZ\nN \u0014\nX\nHn + \u03b3(n, n + \u03bc) dx(Jn J\u0304n+\u03bc + Jn+\u03bc J\u0304n )\n\n(2)\n\nn=1\n\nHere Hn is the SU1 (2) WZNW Hamiltonian\n2\u03c0v\nHn =\n3\n\nZ\n\ndx : J2n : + : J\u03042n :\n\n\u0001\n\n(3)\n\nwhere v = \u03c0Jk a0 /2 is the spin velocity, Jna (x), J \u0304na (x) are operators representing holomorphic and antiholomorphic\ncurrents belonging to the SU(2)1 Kac-Moody algebra. The currents with different n commute. The coupling constant\n\u03b3(n, n + \u03bc) \u223c Jr (n, n + \u03bc). Continuum limit Hamiltonian (2) coincides with the one introduced by Emery, Kivelson\nand Zachar[3] in the context of theory of stripes. We emphasise that the interchain interaction in this frustrated model\nremains relevant and generates spectral gaps. Therefore this model does not belong to the class of sliding Luttinger\nliquid models where soliton excitations remain confined to the chains.\nThough the authors of [1] have managed to proof the existence of spin S = 1/2 excitations in model (2), it remained\nunclear whether these excitations are able to propagate in the direction transverse to the chains or remain confined.\nIn the Confederate Flag model the staggered magnetization operator creates two non-interacting spinons (the absence\nof interaction follows from the fact that these spinons belong to different sectors of the Hamiltonian H + , H \u2212 , -see\nbelow). Therefore one way to resolve the problem of propagation is to calculate correlation functions of the staggered\nmagnetizations between different chains. If these correlation functions do not vanish, the excitations propagate. The\ndifficulty is that such correlation functions are essentially non-perturbative objects (they remain zero in any order of\nperturbation theory) and to calculate them one has to somehow go beyond perturbation theory. The corresponding\nmethods are available for a finite number of chains (namely N = 2, 3, 4 where exact solutions are available). Though\nthe most interesting case corresponds to an infinite number of chains N \u2192 \u221e, information obtained for finite N may\nalso provide valuable insights. The calculations of the interchain correlation function of staggered magnetizations done\n\n\f2\nin [1] for the case of two chains gave a nonvanishing answer, but one may argue that N = 2 is too small a number\nto allow even a qualitative extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit. Similar calculations done for N = 4 could not\ndistinguish between intra and interchain correlation functions. In this paper we perform accurate calculations for the\ncase of four chains N = 4. We find that the interchain correlation functions do not vanish.\nIn the continuum limit the staggered magnetization N = (\u22121)j Sj and the dimerization \u01eb = (\u22121)j (Sj Sj+1 ) operators\nbecome smooth fields. For the chain number n they are expressed through matrix elements of the S = 1/2 primary\nfield of the n-th WZNW model:\n\u011d\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 (n; x) = \u03b4\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 \u01eb(n; x) + i(~\u03c3 )\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 N(n; x)\n\n(4)\n\nThe action for model (2) is local in g and posseses the global SUR (2)\u00d7SUL (2) symmetry. Namely, the action remains\ninvariant under the following transformations:\ng2n \u2192 g2n V, g2m+1 \u2192 V + g2m+1 ,\ng2n \u2192 U g2n , g2m+1 \u2192 g2m+1 U + ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere V, U are coordinate-independent SU(2) matrices. This symmetry dictates the following form of the two-point\ncorrelation functions:\nhhg\u03c31 \u03c32 (\u03c4, x; 2n)g\u03c3+3 \u03c34 (0, 0; 2m)ii = \u03b4s1 \u03c34 \u03b4s2 \u03c33 D2n,2m (\u03c4, x)\nhhg\u03c31 \u03c32 (\u03c4, x; 2n)g\u03c33 \u03c34 (0, 0; 2m + 1)ii = \u03b4s1 \u03c34 \u03b4s2 \u03c33 D2n,2m+1 (\u03c4, x)\n\n(6)\n\nwhere D do not contain spin indices. Substituting Eq.(4) in the above equations we obtain the following important\nrelation between correlation functions of staggered energy density and staggered magnetization:\na\na\nhh\u01eb2n (\u03c4, x)\u01eb2m (0, 0)ii = hhN2n\n(\u03c4, x)N2m\n(0, 0)ii\na\na\nhh\u01eb2n+1 (\u03c4, x)\u01eb2m+1 (0, 0)ii = hhN2n+1 (\u03c4, x)N2m+1\n(0, 0)ii\na\na\nhh\u01eb2n (\u03c4, x)\u01eb2m+1 (0, 0)ii = \u2212hhN2n (\u03c4, x)N2m+1 (0, 0)ii\n\n(7)\n\nNow let us recall the important feature of Hamiltonian (2): as was noticed in [1], it separates into a sum of two\ncommuting parts: H = H + + H \u2212 (such structure of the Hamiltonian was first observed in the context of Kondo\nlattice in [2]) . Therefore eigenstates are separated into two sectors with different parity. The Hamiltonian density in\nthe plus parity sector is\nH+ =\n\n\u0001\n2\u03c0v\n: J1 2 : + : J3 2 : + : J\u030422 : + : J\u030424 : + (\u03bbJ1 + \u03bb\u2032 J3 )(\u03bbJ\u03042 + \u03bb\u2032 J\u03044 )\n3\n\n(8)\n\nFor the purposes of this paper we find it convenient to consider different copling constants \u03bb 6= \u03bb\u2032 such that the\ndifference between these coupling constants is small (|\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb\u2032 | << \u03bb). Physically this means that we still consider the\nfrustrated interchain interactions, but allow their amplitudes to vary between different chains.\nBy using the Abelian bosonization procedure for the SU1 (2) currents one can write the Hamiltonians H \u00b1 in terms\nof bosonic fields \u03c6, \u03c6\u0304 living on each chain (see [1] for the details). In this representation fields \u03c61,3 (\u03c6\u03041,3 ) interact with\nthe fields \u03c6\u03042,4 (\u03c62,4 ) such that\nH = H + [\u03c61,3 ; \u03c6\u03042,4 ] + H \u2212 [\u03c6\u03041,3 ; \u03c62,4 ]\n\n(9)\n\nThe convenience of this representation is related to the fact that it allows to represent \u011d(j) in a factorized form:\n\u221a\n1\n\u011d\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 = \u221a C\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 : exp[\u2212i 2\u03c0(\u03c3\u03c6 + \u03c3 \u2032 \u03c6\u0304)] :\u2261 C\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 z\u03c3 z\u0304\u03c3\u2032 ,\n2\n\u2032\ni\nC \u2032 = e \u03c0(1\u2212\u03c3\u03c3 )/4 ,\n\u03c3\u03c3\n\n(10)\n\nwhere\n\u221a\n\u221a\nz\u03c3 = exp[i\u03c3 2\u03c0\u03c6], z\u0304\u03c3 = exp[\u2212i\u03c3 2\u03c0 \u03c6\u0304], (\u03c3 = \u00b11).\n\n(11)\n\nEqs.(9,10) select a set of potentially non-vanishing interchain correlators:\n\u221a\n\n\u221a\n\n\u221a\n\n\u221a\n\nG13 = hhei 2\u03c0\u03c6(1) e\u2212i 2\u03c0\u03c6(3) ii, \u1e2013 = hhei 2\u03c0\u03c6\u0304(1) e\u2212i 2\u03c0\u03c6\u0304(3) ii\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nD = hhei 2\u03c0\u03c6(1) ei 2\u03c0\u03c6\u0304(2) ii, D\u0304 = hhei 2\u03c0\u03c6\u0304(1) e\u2212i 2\u03c0\u03c6(2) ii\n12\n\n12\n\n(12)\n\n\f3\nFrom these correlators one can obtain correlation functions of both vector N and scalar \u01eb staggered fields:\na\na\nhh\u01eb2n (\u03c4, x)\u01eb2m (0, 0)ii = hhN2n\n(\u03c4, x)N2m\n(0, 0)ii = |G2n,2m (\u03c4, x)|2\n\na\na\nhh\u01eb2n (\u03c4, x)\u01eb2m+1 (0, 0)ii = \u2212hhN2n\n(\u03c4, x)N2m+1\n(0, 0)ii = |D2n,2m+1 (\u03c4, x)|2\n\n(13)\n\nAccording to these formulas spins on neighboring chains are oriented antiferromagnetically. We emphasise that\nthis conclusion follows just from the symmetry arguments and the chiral decoupling of the operators (10) and the\nHamiltonian (9).\nII.\n\nEXACT SOLUTION OF MODEL (8)\n\nThe exact solution of model (8) was obtained in [4]. The spectrum includes heavy solitons and antisolitons with\nmass M and a light singlet Majorana fermion with mass m. The mass ratio is m/M \u223c (\u03bb\u2212\u03bb\u2032 ) and vanishes in the limit\nof equal couplings. This is the limit which was studied in [1], it corresponds to the uniform interchain interactions and\nperiodic boundary conditions in the transverse direction. The presence of such periodicity constitutes an additional\nsymmetry whose presence leads to vanishing of certain correlation functions. Therefore we prefer to keep m/M finite.\nThe two-particle scattering matrix of model (8) is given by\nS(\u03b8) =\n\n\u03b8/2\n\u2212i\n,\u03c3\u03042\n\u03b4\u03c3,\u03c3\u0304 ee\u03b8/2 +\nS[su(2); \u03b8]\u03c3\u03c3\u030411 ,\u03c3\n2\ni\n\u03b8/2\ni\n\u03b4\u03c3,\u03c3\u0304 ee\u03b8/2 \u2212\n\u22121\n+i\n\n!\n\nwhere S[su(2)] is a 2\u00d72 scattering matrix of the SU(2) Thirring model.\nThe Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) are\nZ\nZ\nTM\nTm\nd\u03b8 cosh \u03b8 ln[1 + e\u01eb1 (\u03b8)/T ] \u2212\nd\u03b8 cosh \u03b8 ln[1 + e\u01eb2 (\u03b8)/T ]\nF/L = \u2212\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n\u01ebn (\u03b8) = T s \u2217 ln[1 + e\u01ebn\u22121 (\u03b8)/T ][1 + e\u01ebn+1 (\u03b8)/T ]\n\u2212 \u03b4n,1 m cosh \u03b8 \u2212 \u03b4n,2 M cosh \u03b8\n\n(14)\n\n(15)\n\n(16)\n\nThese equations are valid for \u03bb\u2032 \u2248 \u03bb.\nIt is worth mentioning that model (8) is generated in the relativistic limit as the spin sector of the following fermionic\nmodel:\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\nZ\n2\nX\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n\uf8fb,\nH = dx \uf8f0\nCj\u03c3\n(\u2212\u2202x2 \u2212 kF2 )Cj\u03c3 + t(C1\u03c3\nC2\u03c3 + C2\u03c3\nC1\u03c3 ) \u2212 gCj\u03c3\nCk\u03c3 Ck\u03c3\n\u2032 Cj\u03c3 \u2032\nj=1\n\n\u03c3 = \u00b11/2, j = 1, 2; g > 0\n\n(17)\n\nFrom the solution of this model obtained in [5] it can be extracted that\n\u0012 \u00132\nm\n\u03c0 t\u22a5\n=\nln2 (\u01ebF /M )\nM\n8 \u01ebF\n4\nM = 2 kF g exp(\u2212\u03c0kF /g)\n\u03c0\n\n(18)\n\nwhich provides a direct relationship with model (8).\nIII.\n\nTHE CORRELATION FUNCTIONS\n\nWe shall calculate the correlation functions using the formfactor approach. In this approach one calculates matrix\nelements (formfactors) of various operators using their transformation properties under various symmetries of the\nproblem. General information about the method can be obtained from various review articles [6],[7].\n\n\f4\n\u221a\n\u221a\nLet us consider operators exp[i\u03c3 2\u03c0\u03c61 ] and exp[i\u03c3 2\u03c0\u03c63 ]. We will be interested only in the limit m << M ,\ntherefore it is sufficient to consider the states with one soliton (antisoliton) and arbitrary number of light particles.\nIn this case it is reasonable to suggest the following formfactor expansions:\n\u221a\nexp[i\u03c3 2\u03c0\u03c61 ]|0 >= Qeven + Qodd\n\u221a\n(19)\nexp[i\u03c3 2\u03c0\u03c63 ]|0 >= Qeven \u2212 Qodd\nwhere Qeven (Qodd ) has matrix elements with the states with of one heavy soliton and even (odd) number of light\nMajorana fermions. Notice that the on-chain correlation functions for both operators are the same as it must be.\nThe problem is simplified by the fact that the Majorana fermions have a non-trivial scattering matrix only with the\nheavy particle. Otherwise the dependence of the matrix element on the Majorana fermion rapidities is like for the\nIsing model. Using the results of [8], where a systems with a similar S-matrix was studied, we obtain for the following\nexpressions:\n< s(\u03b2); \u03c71 (\u03b21 ), ...\u03c72n (\u03b22 n)|Qeven = (C + )1/2 e\u03b2/4\n\n2n\nY\n\nj=1\n\n< s(\u03b2); \u03c71 (\u03b21 ), ...\u03c72n+1 (\u03b22n+1 )|Qodd = C \u2212\n\n1/2 \u03b2/4\n\ne\n\n\u03c8 (\u2212) (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b2j )\n\n2n+1\nY\nj=1\n\nY\n\ntanh (\u03b2ij /2)\n\n(20)\n\nY\n\n(21)\n\ni.j\n\n\u03c8 (\u2212) (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b2j )\n\ntanh (\u03b2ij /2)\n\ni.j\n\nwhere \u03b2 is the soliton's rapidity and \u03b2i stand for the rapidities of the light particles. C \u00b1 are normalization factors to\nbe determined later. The function \u03c8 (\u2212) (\u03b2) satisfies the following equation\n\u03c8 (\u2212) (\u03b2)\u03c8 (\u2212) (\u03b2 \u2212 i\u03c0) =\n\n1\n1 + ie\u03b2\n\n(22)\n\nand is given by\n\u03c8 (\u2212) (\u03b2) = e\u2212\u03b2/4 \u03c8 (0) (\u03b2),\n\u001a Z\n(0)\n\u22123/4\n\u03c8 (\u03b2) = 2\nexp \u2212\n\n(23)\n\u221e\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2\n\nd\u03c9 2 sin [(\u03b2 + i\u03c0)\u03c9/2] + sinh (\u03c0\u03c9/2)\n\u03c9\n2 sinh(\u03c0\u03c9) cosh(\u03c0\u03c9/2)\n\n\u001b\n\nAs follows from (22), this function has the following asymptotics:\n\u03c8 (\u2212) (\u03b2 \u2192 +\u221e) \u2192 ie\u2212\u03b2/2\n\u03c8 (\u2212) (\u03b2 \u2192 \u2212\u221e) \u2192 1\n\n(24)\n\n\u221a\nThe operators exp[i 2\u03c0 \u03c6\u0304(2, 4)] are expressed in a similar way, but with all rapidities having the opposite sign.\nTherefore their expansions include the function \u03c8 (+) (\u03b2) = \u03c8 (\u2212) (\u2212\u03b2) which decays at \u2212\u221e and approaches 1 at\n\u03b2 \u2192 +\u221e.\nLet us briefly comment on expressions (20,21). The operators under consideration have Lorentz spin 1/4. This\ndictates that under the Lorentz transformation \u03b2 \u2192 \u03b2 + \u03b8, \u03b2j \u2192 \u03b2j + \u03b8 the matrix element of that operator must\nacquire a factor exp(\u03b8/4). As we see from (20,21), this property is fulfilled. Another property is that the formfactor is\nmultiplied on the S-matrix S(\u03b2, \u03b2 \u2032 ) whenever two particles with rapidities \u03b2 and \u03b2 \u2032 are interchanged. Since tanh(\u03b2ij /2)\nis an odd function, this is obviously fulfilled for the Majorana fermions. The function \u03c8 plays the same role for the\nineterchange of a Majorana fermion and the heavy particle. The choice of asymptotics of functions \u03c8 (\u00b1) is determined\nby the fact that in on small distances bosonic exponents (19) become (anti)holomorphic fields.\nSubstituting (20,21) into Eqs.(19) and performing certain algebraic manipulations (see Appendix 1), we arrive at\nthe following expressions for the correlation functions on the same and on different chains (r2 = \u03c4 2 + x2 , we put\nv = 1):\nGpq \u2261 hhei\n\n\u221a\n\nDpq \u2261 hhei\n\n\u221a\n2\u03c0\u03c6(p) \u2212i 2\u03c0\u03c6(q)\n\n\u221a\n\ne\n\n2\u03c0\u03c6(p)\n\nei\n\n\u221a\n2\u03c0 \u03c6\u0304(q)\n\nii =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c4 \u2212 ix\n\u03c4 + ix\n\n\u00131/4\n\nC(M 4 m)1/8 Fpq (r)\n\nii = C(M 4 m)1/8 Fpq (r)\n\n(25)\n\n\f5\nwhere C is a numerical coefficient, p, q = 1, 3 for G and p = 1, 3; q = 2, 4 for D.\nF11 (r) = F33 (r) =\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f1\nZ\nn\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f2X 1 Z\nY\nY\n[cosh(\u03b2ij /2)]\u22121\n|\u03c8 (\u2212) (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b2j )|2 e\u2212mr cosh \u03b2j\n= d\u03b2e\u03b2/2 e\u2212Mr cosh \u03b2 exp\nd\u03b2\n\uf8fe\n\uf8f3\nn\nn=1\ni>j\nj\n\nF13 (r) = F24 (r) =\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f1\nZ\nn\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f2X (\u22121)n Z\nY\nY\n[cosh(\u03b2ij /2)]\u22121\n|\u03c8 (\u2212) (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b2j )|2 e\u2212mr cosh \u03b2j\nd\u03b2\n= d\u03b2e\u03b2/2 e\u2212Mr cosh \u03b2 exp\n\uf8fe\n\uf8f3\nn\nn=1\ni>j\nj\n\nFor the correlation functions on neighboring chains (see Eqs.(13) (p = 1, 3; q = 2, 4) we have\n\uf8f1\n\uf8fc\nZ\nn\n\uf8f2X 1 Z\n\uf8fd\nY\nY\nD12 (r) = d\u03b2e\u2212Mr cosh \u03b2 exp\n[cosh(\u03b2ij /2)]\u22121\n|\u03c8 (0) (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b2j )|2 e\u2212mr cosh \u03b2j\nd\u03b2\n\uf8f3\n\uf8fe\nn\nn=1\ni>j\nj\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f1\nZ\nn\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f2 X (\u22121)n Z\nY\nY\n[cosh(\u03b2ij /2)]\u22121\n|\u03c8 (0) (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b2j )|2 e\u2212mr cosh \u03b2j\nd\u03b2\nD14 (r) = d\u03b2e\u2212Mr cosh \u03b2 exp\n\uf8fe\n\uf8f3\nn\nn=1\ni>j\nj\n\n(26)\n\n(27)\n\n(28)\n\nThe normalization factor (M 3 m)1/8 in Eqs.(25) is dictated by the facts that (i) the single chain correlation functions\ndo not vanish in the limit m \u2192 0, (ii) the scaling dimension of the operator is 1/4. In the limit M r >> 1, mr << 1\nthe integral in \u03b2 converges at |\u03b2| \u223c (M r)\u22121/2 . Since |\u03c8 (0) (\u03b2j )|2 \u223c exp(\u2212|\u03b2j |/2), the integrals in \u03b2j converge even at\nmr = 0. As result we get\nD12 (r) = C(M 3 m)1/8 K0 (M r), D14 (r) = C(M 3 m)1/8 K0 (M r)\n\n(29)\n\nwhere is C the numerical constant which remains undertermined. To calculate the other asymptotics is a more\ncomplicated task. The calculations are done in Appendix 2; the result is\nF11 (r) = C11 M \u22121/4 e\u2212Mr r\u22125/8\n\nF13 (r) = C13 m1/2 M \u22123/4 r\u22121/8 e\u2212Mr\n\n(30)\n\nwhere C are again undertermined numerical constants. From here we derive the following estimates for the singularities\nin the imaginary part of the staggered magnetic susceptibility (dimerization) at s = 2M, (s2 = \u03c9 2 \u2212 q 2 ):\nIm\u03c711 (s) \u223c (s \u2212 2M )\u22121/4 , Im\u03c712 \u223c \u2212m1/4 (s \u2212 2M )\u22121/2 , Im\u03c713 (s) \u223c mM \u22125/4 \u03b8(s \u2212 2M )\n\n(31)\n\nThese expressions are valid at s \u2212 2M >> m so that Im\u03c712 cannot really become greater than Im\u03c711 .\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nLooking at expressions for the interchain correlation functions, we see that thay are proportional to powers of the\nparticle masses. These masses are generated dynamically in the theory, they are exponentially small in the inverse\ncoupling constant and therefore the interchain tunneling of the solitons is an essentially non-perturbative process. This\nconclusion coincides with the result for two chains [1]. The four chain case, however, introduces a new feature: the\npresence of the singlet particle. It is interesting that the prefactor in the interchain correlation functions contains both\nmasses and vanishes when the mass of the singlet particle goes to zero (this occurs for periodic boundary conditions\nin the transverse direction; the case considered in [1]). This indicates that the singlet sector plays an important\nrole in the interchain propagation of solitons probably providing conditions for an uninhibited tunneling. We remind\nthe reader that the fraction of the Hilbert space occupied by singlet excitations grows with the number of chains [1]\nand these excitations will certainly play an important role in the thermodynamic limit determining interchain soliton\npropagation.\nIn conclusion we would like to emphasise a curious symmetry between correlations functions of the staggered energy\ndensity and magnetization (13) existing in Confederate Flag magnet. This symmetry unites \u01eb and N into a fourcomponent vector giving rise to an analogy between this model and models of non-collinear magnets. As it was\npointed out in [9], spinons naturally exist in disordered non-collinear magnets and it looks likely that Confederate\nFlag model provides a microscopic realization of that scenario.\n\n\f6\nV.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe are grateful to Alexander Its for valueable discussions and references.

First, let us consider as an example\nthe scaling of the Ising model. It is well-known that the correlation functions of the order and disorder parameter\noperators for this model can be expressed as follows:\nh\u03bc(x)\u03bc(0)i = G+ (mr) + G\u2212 (mr),\nh\u03c3(x)\u03c3(0)i = G+ (mr) \u2212 G\u2212 (mr),\n\n\f7\n\u221e\nX\n\nG\u00b1 (\u03c1) =\n\n(\u00b1)n\n\nn=0\n\n1\nn!\n\nZ\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nd\u03b21 * * *\n\nZ\u221e\n\nd\u03b2n e\u2212\u03c1\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nP\n\ncosh \u03b2j\n\n1\ntanh2 (\u03b2i \u2212 \u03b2j )\n2\ni<j\nY\n\nThe functions G\u00b1 are determinants of the Fredholm operators:\nG\u00b1 (\u03c1) = det (I \u00b1 K)\nwhere K is the integral operator with the kernel:\n1\n\nK(\u03b21 , \u03b22 ) = e\u2212 2 \u03c1(cosh \u03b21 +cosh \u03b22 )\n\n1\ncosh 21 (\u03b21 \u2212 \u03b22 )\n\nFrom here one can conclude that G\u00b1 satisfy the Painlev\u00e9 equation [10] and perform a rather detailed analysis of these\nfunctions. The analysis of asymptotic behavior is a simplier task however and can be performed as follows. Using the\nformula\nlog(detA) = Tr(log A)\n\n(37)\n\none obtains:\n\u221e\nX\n\n1\nlog (G\u00b1 (\u03c1)) =\n(\u00b1)\nn\nn=1\n\nZ\u221e\n\nn\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nd\u03b21 * * *\n\nZ\u221e\n\nd\u03b2n e\n\n\u2212\u03c1\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nP\n\ncosh \u03b2j\n\nn\nY\n\n1\n\ncosh2 21 (\u03b2i\ni=1\n\n\u2212 \u03b2i+1 )\n\nwhere \u03b2n+1 \u2261 \u03b21 . Consider one of integrals:\nZ\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nd\u03b21 * * *\n\nZ\u221e\n\nd\u03b2n e\u2212\u03c1\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nP\n\ncosh \u03b2j\n\nn\nY\n\n1\n2 1\n(\u03b2\ncosh\ni \u2212 \u03b2i+1 )\n2\ni=1\n\n(38)\n\nWe are interested in the asymptotics for \u03c1 \u2192 0 where the integral diverges. Let us introduce new variables:\n\u2206i = \u03b2i \u2212 \u03b2i+1 ,\n\u03c9=\n\nN\nX\n\ni = 1, * * * , n \u2212 1,\n\ncosh(\u03b2j )\n\n(39)\n\nj=1\n\nThen the integral becomes\nZ\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere\n\nd\u22061 * * *\n\nZ\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nd\u2206n\u22121 2\n\nZ\u221e\n\nD(\u2206)\n\nn\u22121\nY\ne\u2212\u03c1\u03c9\n1\n1\n\u0010 \u0011\n\u0010P \u0011\nd\u03c9 p\n\u2206\n\u2206j\n2\n2\nj\n\u03c9 \u2212 D(\u2206) j=1 cosh\ncosh\n2\n2\n\nD(\u22061 , * * * , \u2206n\u22121 ) =\n\n\u0010X\n\ne\u03b2 j\n\n\u0011 \u0010X\n\ne\u2212\u03b2j\n\n\u0011\n\nIt is clear that the integrals over \u2206j are always rapidly converging while the integral over \u03c9 diverges at \u03c1 \u2192 0. The\nestimation of leading contribution is straightforward. We give the final result for G+ which diverges at \u03c1 \u2192 0:\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nZ\u221e\n\u221e Z\u221e\nn\u22121\nX\nY\n1\n1\n\u0010 \u0011\n\u0010 P \u0011 \uf8fb log(\u03c1)\nlog (G+ (\u03c1)) \u2243 \u2212 \uf8f02\nd\u22061 * * *\nd\u2206n\u22121\n(40)\n\u2206j\n\u2206j\ncosh\ncosh\nj=1\u2212\u221e\nj=1\n2\n2\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThe expression in square brackets is the anomalous dimension. It equals 14 . This value is known from many sources,\nbut actually even direct summation of series is possible. In a similar way we obtain\nlog (G\u2212 (\u03c1)) \u223c \u03c13/4\n\n(41)\n\n\f8\nNow let us turn to the case considered in the present paper.\nF\u00b1 (\u03c1) =\n\u221e\nX\n\n1\n=\n(\u00b1)\nn!\nn=0\nn\n\nZ\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nZ\u221e\n\nd\u03b21 * * *\n\nd\u03b2n e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u03c1\n\nP\n\ncosh \u03b2j\n\nn\nY\n1\n\u03c8 (\u2212) (\u03b2j )\ntanh (\u03b2i \u2212 \u03b2j )\n2\nj=1\ni<j\n\nY\n\n2\n\n2\n\nThe functions F\u00b1 are determinants of the integral operators\nF\u00b1 (\u03c1) = det (I \u00b1 L)\nwhere L is the integral operator with the kernel:\n1\n\n1\n\nL(\u03b21 , \u03b22 ) = e\u2212 2 \u03c1(cosh \u03b21 +cosh \u03b22 )\n\ncosh\n\n1\n2 (\u03b21\n\n\u2212 \u03b22 )\n\n\u03c8 (\u2212) (\u03b21 )\u03c8 (\u2212) (\u03b22 )\n\nSo, similarly to the Ising case the logarithms of these determinants can be written as\nlog (F\u00b1 (\u03c1)) =\n\u221e\nX\n\n1\n=\n(\u00b1)\nn\nn=1\nn\n\nZ\u221e\n\nd\u03b21 * * *\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nZ\u221e\n\nd\u03b2n e\u2212\u03c1\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nP\n\ncosh \u03b2j\n\nn\nY\n\n1\n\ncosh2 12 (\u03b2i\ni=1\n\n\u2212 \u03b2i+1 )\n\n\u03c8 (\u2212) (\u03b2j )\n\n2\n\nConsider the integral\nZ\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nd\u03b21 * * *\n\nZ\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nd\u03b2n e\u2212\u03c1\n\nP\n\ncosh \u03b2j\n\nn\nY\n\ni=1\n\n1\n\u03c8 (\u2212) (\u03b2j )\n2 1\ncosh 2 (\u03b2i \u2212 \u03b2i+1 )\n\n2\n\nand make change of variables (39). The difference with the Ising case is due to the fact that we need to express \u03b2j in\nterms of the new variables and to substitute them into \u03c8. We have:\n!\n\u0010\n\u0011\nX\np\n\u03b2j = log \u03c9 \u2213 \u03c9 2 \u2212 D2 (\u2206) \u2212 log e\u2212\u03b2j\ne\u03b2 k\n(42)\nk\n\nwhere the last term depends only on \u2206's. The integral over \u03c9 is taken between the limits D(\u2206) and \u221e over two\nbranches: one the first one one takes + sign in (42), and on the second one the minus sign. The part divergent at\n\u03c1 \u2192 0 comes from the region where \u2212 log(\u03c9) is large. It is not the second branch of the integral over \u03c9, since |\u03c8 (\u2212) (\u03b2)|\nis rapidly decreasing as \u03b2 \u2192 +\u221e. So, only the first branch contributes, and, since |\u03c8 (\u2212) (\u03b2)| rapidly approaches 1 as\n\u03b2 \u2192 \u2212\u221e, we can replace all |\u03c8 (\u2212) (\u03b2j )| by 1. The result of this considerations is that the asymptotics of the integral\nis 12 of what we had in the Ising case.
