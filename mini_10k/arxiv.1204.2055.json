The hydrodynamic interaction\nof bulk suspensions is long-ranged and decays with inter-particle distance R as 1/R [1, 2]. In many real circumstances,\nparticles are not completely free, but spatially confined in some special environments, such as microfluidic devices,\nporous media, fluid interface and cell membrane[3\u20135]. The hydrodynamics behaviors of confined colloidal suspensions\nare one of the current investigation focus. In 2000, E. R. Dufresne et al. [6] measured the dynamic coupling of\nparticle pair above a single flat wall using optical tweezers. Their experimental results showed that while the distance\nof particles to the wall is about three times of particle radius, the hydrodynamics interaction between particle pair\ndecays with R as 1/R2 . In 2011, P. L. Pushkar et al. [7] made a further investigation on many-body hydrodynamic\ninteraction in the presence of a single wall by holographic optical tweezers and dynamic simulation. They found\nthat the behaviors of hydrodynamic interactions between particle pair and multi-particle clusters are similar, i.e.,\nthe hydrodynamics interaction between particles in clusters also decays with R as 1/R2 . This results differ from\nthat in bulk in which hydrodynamic screen appears in high particle concentration. B. Cui et al. investigated the\nhydrodynamic interaction between particles in a narrow channel [7] and confined between two plates [9] in 2002\nand 2004, respectively. They found that a linear channel sharply screens the hydrodynamic interaction; and the\nhydrodynamic interaction of particles confined between two plane walls decays with R as 1/R2 . Perpendicular to the\nline joining the centers of particles confined between two plates the cross-correlation is negative, i.e., particles exert\nanti-drag on one another in this direction. The circulation current is the direct cause for this negative coupling. The\nabove works revealed the corrected dynamic characters of colloidal particles confined by hard wall.\nThere is a non-slip boundary condition near a hard wall which could cut off the fluid field in its vicinity. The fluid\ninterface is a slip boundary and may not cut off the fluid field. The influences of boundary condition reflect directly\non the correlated dynamics of particles. Because of the effects of the spatial symmetry breaking, the hydrodynamic\ninteraction of particles at an air-water interface is different from that in symmetrical bulk. In 2006, V. Prasad et\n\n\u2217\n\nCorresponding author Tel.: +86 21 55665338\naddress: phchenwei@gmail.com\n\n\u2020 Electronic\n\n\f2\nal. [10] investigated the hydrodynamic interaction between particles at an air-water interface and found that there\nis a transition from three-dimension (3D) to two-dimension (2D) hydrodynamics with increasing surface viscosity \u03b7s .\nAt high \u03b7s , the correlated motion along the line joining the centers of particles Drr , and ones perpendicular to this\nline D\u03b8\u03b8 are nearly equal and have logarithmic R dependence. With the decrease of \u03b7s , the decay rate of Drr and\nD\u03b8\u03b8 with R increases and the their values begin to deviate. At low \u03b7s , Drr \u221d 1/R, D\u03b8\u03b8 \u221d 1/R2 . Notwithstanding\nthe differences in the behavior of Drr , D\u03b8\u03b8 at high and low \u03b7s , all the data sets can be scaled onto a single master\ncurve by \u03b7s . Evidently, the surface viscosity \u03b7s has a substantial influence on both Drr and D\u03b8\u03b8 . In 2011, M. H.\nLee et al. [11] investigated the correlated motion of particles at an oil-water interface. Their experiment results also\nshow a transformation from 3D to 2D hydrodynamics with the increase of \u03b7s . The results of Prasad et al. have the\neffect of fluid field only from one side; and ones of Lee et al. have the influence of the fluid field from two side. The\nhydrodynamic interaction between particles at an oil-water interface is influenced by the viscosity of the oil \u03b7oil , water\n\u03b7w and interface \u03b7int . From the above, we know that the dynamic characters of colloidal system in the confined\ncondition exhibited much more rich physical image than that in the bulk. The investigations on the dynamics of\nconfined colloidal suspensions have significant application in many important field, such as pharmacy and Biological\nscience etc. [12].\nWe are interested in the influence of the hydrodynamic and Coulomb interactions on dynamic characters of colloidal\nsystem when the boundary condition changes from the symmetry to completely asymmetry, such as air-water interface.\nIn the previous experiment investigations about the hydrodynamic interactions between particles at an air(oil)-water\ninterface the interface viscosity \u03b7int was treated as an adjustment parameters. In this paper, we measured the cross\ncorrelation of colloidal interfacial diffusion under the different interfacial concentrations of weakly charged colloidal\nspheres, and investigate the influence of Coulomb interaction between the spheres on the correlated motion.\nGetting rid of the impurity from the aqueous surface, we make a clean air-water interface and investigate the\ncorrelated motions of silica spheres S1 (d = 1.57\u03bcm), S2 (d = 0.97\u03bcm) and S3 (d = 0.73\u03bcm) at this pure interface by\noptical microscopy and multi-particle tracking. The experiment results show that the cross correlation of particles at\npure air-water interface is stronger than that exhibited in the experiments of Prasad et al. [10] in the case of low \u03b7s .\nThe correlated motion Drr \u221d 1/R0.86\u00b10.02 turns into Drr \u221d 1/R0.68\u00b10.02 when n was from 0.03 to 0.35. The particles\nused in our experiment are weakly charged silica spheres. Coulomb interactions between particles enhanced the cross\ncorrelation of particles. With the increase of particles' area fraction n, the mean particle separation decreases and\nCoulomb interactions increase. Thus the cross correlation of particles enhances and the decay rate of Drr and D\u03b8\u03b8\nwith R decreases as n is increased. The correlated motion of particles as a function of inter-particle distance R for\ndifferent n is presented. As discussed in the paper, the Coulomb interaction between colloidal particles should serve\nas an effective surface viscoelastical role in our system. Though the differences in the behavior of correlated motion\n\u00113/2\n\u0010\n\u03b7w d\nand correlation function < Drr,\u03b8\u03b8 /\u03c4 > /2Ds ,\nfor different n and particles, with the scaled separation R\nd\n\u03b7es,2p\nall the correlated motion can be scaled onto a single master curve.

We present the effective surface viscosity \u03b7es,2p as a function of the area fraction n for different silica spheres.\nParticles S3 exhibit an anomalous long-range correlation which we do not understand at present.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section II is devoted to the description of the experiment setup and results. In\nsection III, data analysis are presented. In section IV, further discussions are given. Finally, the work is summarized\nin section V.\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENT SETUP AND RESULTS\n\nThe particles used in the experiment are silica sphere 1 (S1)with the diameter d = 1.57 \u00b1 0.06\u03bcm, silica sphere 2\n(S2) with the diameter d = 0.97 \u00b1 0.05\u03bcm and silica sphere 3 (S3) with the diameter d = 0.73 \u00b1 0.04\u03bcm. The S1 and\nS3 particles were purchased from Duke Scientific and were synthesized by the St\u00f6ber method, followed by a sintering\nprocess at 9000 C to drive off all organic materials and water. The particles S2 were purchased from Bangs Laboratories\nand are non porous spheres. We follow the same procedures as described in Ref.[13] for the experimental setup and\nthe sample preparation and cleaning. The sample cell is made from a stainless steel disk (which is hydrophilic) with\na central hole of diameter 13mm. The bottom of the hole is sealed with a 0.1mm thick glass cover slip, which also\nserves as an optical window. The sidewall of the hole together with the bottom glass slip forms a container, which has\nan effective height of 1.0mm. The top of the container has a sharp circular edge, which is used to pin the air-water\ninterface and reduce unwanted drift. The entire cell is placed on the sample stage of an inverted microscope, so that\nthe motion of the interfacial particles can be viewed from below and recorded by a digital camera.\nWe take great care to clean the particle samples and the air-water interface. Surface pressure measurements reveal\nthat no detectable impurity is found in the cleaned particle samples. The particle-methanol solution is then injected\n\n\f3\nonto a cleaned interface using a syringe pump. The silica spheres disperse well at the clean air-water interface.\nIndividual particles undergo vigorous Brownian motion and remain stable at the interface for days. These particles\nremain in focus under high magnification, indicating that the silica spheres are strongly bound to the interface and\ntheir vertical position is determined by an energy minimum. The usual capillary effect is not applicable to micronsized spheres for the gravitational energy of the particles is much smaller than the relevant energy of the interface, and\nparticles can choose an equilibrium vertical position without introducing long-range deformations to the interface.\nTo obtain good images of the silica particles phase contrast microscopy is used. Using homemade software with\na spatial resolution of 60-100nm we construct particle trajectories from the consecutive images. From the particle\ntrajectories, we determine the vector displacements of the tracers \u2206r(t, \u03c4 ) = r(t + \u03c4 ) \u2212 r(t), where t is the absolute\ntime and \u03c4 is the lag time. In the experiment, we measure the mean cross-correlated particle motion [2]:\nD\u03b1\u03b2 (r, \u03c4 ) =< \u2206r\u03b1i (t, \u03c4 )\u2206r\u03b2j (t, \u03c4 )\u03b4(r \u2212 Ri,j (t)) >i6=j ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere i, j are particle indicates, \u03b1 and \u03b2 represent different coordinates, and Ri,j is the distance between particle i\nand j. The off-diagonal elements are assumed to be uncorrelated. We focus on the diagonal elements of this tensor\nproduct: Drr which indicates the correlated motion along the line joining the centers of particles, and D\u03b8\u03b8 which\nrepresents the correlated motion perpendicular to this line.\nThe correlated motion Drr and D\u03b8\u03b8 are the function of R and \u03c4 . The lag time \u03c4 need approach to zero to eliminate\nits effect on R = R(\u03c4 ). There are two ways to calculate the \u03c4 -independent quantities < Drr /\u03c4 >\u03c4 and < D\u03b8\u03b8 /\u03c4 >\u03c4 ,\nwhich depend only on R. Firstly, if the data shows Drr , D\u03b8\u03b8 \u221d \u03c4 within the observation period of \u03c4 , the slopes of\nDrr , D\u03b8\u03b8 versus \u03c4 are given by Drr /\u03c4 and D\u03b8\u03b8 /\u03c4 . Otherwise, we calculate the partial differential of \u2202Drr /\u2202\u03c4 and\n\u2202D\u03b8\u03b8 /\u2202\u03c4 from which we derived the corresponding slope value at \u03c4 = 0 by the extrapolation.\nWe measured the curve of Drr /\u03c4 and D\u03b8\u03b8 /\u03c4 vs. R for dozens of different area fraction in range of 0.01-0.35 for the\ndata of S1. We make a coarse grain process by grouping the dozen of curves to range: 0.01-0.05, 0.05-0.1, 0.1-0.14,\n0.15-0.17, 0.2, 0.35 (see the figures below). We average curves in each groups respectively. The similar processing\nprocedure had also been down for the data of S2 and S3. The results are obtained by averaging over 106 particles,\nensuring that the statistical averaging is adequate.\nFigure 1 exhibits the measured values of < Drr /\u03c4 > and < D\u03b8\u03b8 /\u03c4 > for silica microspheres S1 scaled by D0 =\nkB T /3\u03c0\u03b7w d as a function of R/d with the area fraction n ranging from 0.01 to 0.05, where \u03b7w is the bulk viscosity of\nwater in room temperature. The average result of these curves were drawn in the inset of Fig.1, while the corresponding\narea fraction n was estimated as 0.03. Solid and open symbols represent < Drr /\u03c4 > /D0 and < D\u03b8\u03b8 /\u03c4 > /D0 ,\nrespectively. The error bar in the inset of Fig. 1 indicates only the error range of the values of correlated motion, but\nit's slope. With the increase of inter-particle distance R, < Drr /\u03c4 > and < D\u03b8\u03b8 /\u03c4 > decrease following the power\nlaw. As shown in Fig. 1, < Drr /\u03c4 >\u221d 1/R0.86\u00b10.02 and < D\u03b8\u03b8 /\u03c4 >\u221d 1/R1.45\u00b10.03 which differs from experiment\nresults of Prasad et al. [10] with low surface viscosity where Drr \u221d 1/R, D\u03b8\u03b8 \u221d 1/R2 .\nFigure 2 (a) exhibits the measured values of < Drr /\u03c4 > and < D\u03b8\u03b8 /\u03c4 > scaled by D0 as a function of R/d\nwith various estimated values of area fraction n for silica microspheres S1. Different scattering symbol represents\nthe data with different area fraction of particles. As shown in Fig. 2 (a), with the increase of area fraction n, the\nmagnitude of curves of < Drr /\u03c4 > and < D\u03b8\u03b8 /\u03c4 > increase. We fit the data in Fig. 2(a) by < Drr /\u03c4 >\u221d 1/R\u03bbr and\n< D\u03b8\u03b8 /\u03c4 >\u221d 1/R\u03bb\u03b8 . Figure 2 (b) shows the fitted parameters \u03bbr and \u03bb\u03b8 , which characters the decay rate of cross\ncorrelation between particles, as a function of n. As shown in Fig. 2 (b), with the increase of n, \u03bbr and \u03bb\u03b8 decrease\nindicating that the decay rate of correlated motion vs. R decreases. Thus, the cross correlation of colloidal diffusion\nwas enhanced with increasing area fraction n.\nFigure 3 (a) and (b) shows the measured values of < Drr /\u03c4 > /D0 and < D\u03b8\u03b8 /\u03c4 > /D0 vs. R/d with various values\nof area fraction n for silica microspheres S2 and S3, respectively. The data processing for S2 and S3 is similar to that\nof S1. Every curve is derived by averaging the data with adjacent area fraction. The data in Fig.3 (a) are qualitatively\nidentical with that in Fig. 2 (a): the correlated motion decays with the inter-particle distance R following the power\nlaw. As the area fraction n is increased, the curves shift to higher values and the decay rate of < Drr /\u03c4 > and\n< D\u03b8\u03b8 /\u03c4 > versus R becomes slow.\nFigure 3 (b) shows an anomalous long-rang correlation. For S3 particles, when n \u2265 0.08 and R > 5d, the decay\nof < Drr /\u03c4 > and < D\u03b8\u03b8 /\u03c4 > becomes slow with increasing R and does not follow power law. At large R region,\n< Drr /\u03c4 > and < D\u03b8\u03b8 /\u03c4 > are weakly dependent on inter-particle distance R. For short inter-particle distance\n(R < 5d), the behaviors of < Drr /\u03c4 > and < D\u03b8\u03b8 /\u03c4 > are similar to that of S1 and S2 particles.\n\n\f4\n\n<Drr, / >/D0\n\n10\n\n<Drr,\n\n/ >/D0\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n1E-3\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\nR/d\n\n0.01\n\n1E-3\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\nR/d\n\nFIG. 1: Correlation function < Drr /\u03c4 > (solid symbols) and < D\u03b8\u03b8 /\u03c4 > (open symbols) (scaled by D0 ) as a function of\ninter-particle distance R (scaled by d) with the area fraction n ranging from 0.01 to 0.05.

The exponent \u03bbr and \u03bb\u03b8 decrease monotonically with the area fraction n. Our results shared the similar\ntrend of the work in Prasad et al. [10], where the exponent is monotonically decreasing by adding HSA protein onto\nsurface. In Prasad's system, the weight of surface viscosity \u03b7s was modified by HSA. By scaling with \u03b7s , the whole\ndispersed curves could collapse onto a single master curve. In our data, D0 should be replaced by Ds = kB T /4\u03c0\u03b7es ,\nwhere \u03b7es is effective surface viscosity. The horizontal axis of R should be scaled by the ratio between the bulk viscosity\nand the surface viscocity. Following the scaling method of Prasad et al. [10], we replot the curves for different n by\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nscaling the two sets of effective surface viscosity \u03b7es and \u03b7es for separation and correlated motion individually.

Different symbols represent the master curve of different particles.\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nThe results shown in Fig.5 are hard to understand. The \u03b7es and \u03b7es should be identical, since they describe the\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\nsame physics feature. However, experimental results show that the discrepancy between \u03b7es and \u03b7es is extraordinarily\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\nlarge, e.g., it exceeds 50 percent for samples S2 while n = 0.2. In Ref.[10], the deviation of \u03b7es and \u03b7es was only within\n15 percent and their averaging values agree well with one-particle viscosity. In our case, the\ndiscrepancy\nis too large\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\nto fall in our experimental error range. Especially considering the dependence form of \u03b7es \u223c (\u03b7es )2/3 in caption of\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\nFig.(5) , the exponent of 2/3 means that the dimension of \u03b7es on \u03b7es are not matching even, which is unreasonable in\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\nphysics. Checking the above scaling process and comparing with \u03b7es \u223c (\u03b7es )2/3 , we think that the dimension scaling\n\u2032\nmethod \u03b7w /\u03b7es may be not necessary way.

The\nsymbols are same as previous. As shown in Fig. 6, all the data sets fall on a single master curve. For samples S2, the\nbehavior of Drr , D\u03b8\u03b8 is identical with that of samples S1 and the data sets of the two kinds of particles can fall on\nthe same master curve, as shown in Fig. 7 (a). For particles S3, in the case of short inter-particle distance R < 5d,\nthe scaled correlated motion Drr , D\u03b8\u03b8 for different n can fall on a single master curve, whose behavior is similar to\nthat of particles S1 and S2. However, when R > 5d the deviation from the master curve appears, which is different\nfrom that of particles S1 and S2. Figure 7 (b) shows that the data of scaled correlated motion Drr , D\u03b8\u03b8 of particle\nS1 and S3 for the case of R < 5d can also collapse onto the same master curve.

We have used Langmuir trough method to measure the changing of surface tension while the area of aqueous\nsurface reduced. No detective impurity was found in the system. We believe that there is no heterogeneity in our\nexperiment system. The two-particle effective surface viscosity \u03b7es,2p should be nearly equal to the one-particle\neffective surface viscosity \u03b7es,1p which is directly related to particles's self-diffusion. To compare \u03b7es,2p and \u03b7es,1p , we\ncalculate one-particle effective surface viscosity \u03b7es,1p as follows. At Ref.[14] Chen et al., presented the short-time\nself-diffusion coefficient Dss of silica particles at an air-water interface via the formula < \u2206r2 (\u03c4 ) >= 4Dss \u03c4 for different\nparticle concentration. The measured Dss /D0 can be fitted to a second-order polynomial,\nDss /D0 = \u03b1(1 \u2212 \u03b2n \u2212 \u03b3n2 ),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 are the fitted parameters. At the n \u2192 0 limit, the short-time self-diffusion coefficient Dss (n) is directly\nrelated to the drag coefficient \u03be via the equation Dss (n = 0) = kB T /\u03be. For particles at a distance z from the interface,\n\u03be = (\u03b71 a)f (z/a, B),\n\n(6)\n\nwhere z is the distance between the sphere's north pole and the interface, i.e., z = 0 when the sphere is in contact with\nthe interface from below, and a is the radius of the sphere [15]. The Boussinesq number B is defined as B = \u03b7s /(\u03b7w a),\nwhere \u03b7s is the shear viscosity of the interface and \u03b7w is the viscosity of bulk of water. Fischer et al. [15, 16] showed\nthat f (z/a, B) = k (0) + k (1) B + o(B 2 ), which reads the effects of interface viscosity on the single-particle. According\nto the relations of short-time self-diffusion coefficient to the drag coefficient, the one-particle effective surface viscosity\ncan be written as:\n\n\u03b7es,1p =\n\n\u0012\n\n6\u03c0\n\u2212 k (0)\n\u03b1(1 \u2212 \u03b2n \u2212 \u03b3n2 )\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03b7w a\n.\nk (1)\n\n(7)\n\nThe zeroth-order and first-order drag coefficient k (0) and k (1) are given by [15]:\n\nk\n\nk (1) \u2248\n\n(\n\n(0)\n\n\u22124 ln\n\u22124 ln\n\n\u2248 6\u03c0\n\n2\n\u03c0\n2\n\u03c0\n\ns\n\ntanh\n\narctan\narctan\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n32 (z/a + 2)\n,\n9\u03c0 2\n\n\u0001\u0001 \u0010\n\n2\na3/2\n3\n(z+3a)3/2\n\u0001\u0001\nz+2a\n3a\n\n\u0011\n\n(8)\n\nf or z > 0\nf or z < 0.\n\n(9)\n\n\f10\nThe zeroth-order drag coefficient k (0) \u2248 15.97, 13.0 and 15.97 for samples S1, S2 and S3 respectively [14]. From k (0) ,\nwe derived the values of k (1) described by formula (9). Substituting k (0) , k (1) and the measured values of \u03b1 \u03b2 and \u03b3\nat Ref.[14] into formula (7), we derived the one-particle effective surface viscosity \u03b7es,1p for different area fraction n.\nFigure 8 (a), (b) and (c) exhibit the relationship of the one-particle effective surface viscosity \u03b7es,1p to the twoparticle one \u03b7es,2p used to create the master curve for particles S1, S2 and S3, respectively. As shown in Fig. 8, the oneand two-particle measurements agree well with each other. The results confirm that the non-heterogeneity argument\nabout our experiment system and the scaling method described in formula (4) are reasonable. But at present we do\nnot derive the scaling relationship of formula (4) theoretically, which deserves further investigation. We vaguely guess\nthe index 3/2 may be related to the dimension feature of the effective surface viscosity, which dependents on both of\nthe bulk and interface viscosities.\nMost interesting phenomenon in the experiment is that the exponent \u03bbr and \u03bb\u03b8 decrease when the colloidal area\nfraction n increases. Experiment results in Fig. 1 indicate that the cross correlation between particles in our experiment is stronger than that exhibited in the experiments of Prasad et al. [10] even in the case of low \u03b7s . By all above\nanalysis, the decrease of \u03bbr and \u03bb\u03b8 value is correspond to the increase of the two-particle effective surface viscosity\n\u03b7es,2p . Figure 9 shows the two-particle effective surface viscosity \u03b7es,2p as a monotonous increasing function of the\narea fraction n for samples S1, S2 and S3. The values of \u03b7es,2p for particles S2 are extraordinary smaller than that of\nS1 and S3.\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nSilica spheres representing an important class of charged particles commonly used in colloidal science have anionic\nSiO\u2212 groups on their surface [17, 18]. These charged spheres at the air-water interface show a DLVO repulsive\ninteraction [14]. The interactions between silica spheres at air-water interface with low fraction\np n include hydrodynamic\nand Coulomb interactions. With the increase of n, the mean particle separation l = d \u03c0/(4n) decreases and the\nmean Coulomb interactions between particles increase. The Coulomb interaction between colloidal particles should\nserve as an effective surface viscoelastical role in our system and enhance the cross correlation of particles diffusion\n(shown as Fig.6 and Fig.9). Regarding the effective surface viscosity \u03b7es,2p as a measurable scale of the energy-cost\ndue to the deformation of interfacial particles configuration, the dependence of \u03b7es,2p on n should share the feature of\ninteraction potential among the silica sphere.\nParticles' interaction potential in our system can be well described by the screened Coulomb potential [14]\nUc (R) \u221d\n\nexp[\u2212R/\u03bbD ]\n,\nR\n\n(10)\n\nwhere R is the separation between the particles, and \u03bbD is the screening length. Referring to this potential form and\nrelationship between R and n, the effective surface viscosity \u03b7es,2p could be written as:\n\n\u03b7es,2p\n\n\u03ba\n=\nd\n\nr\n\nd\n4n\nexp(\u2212\n\u03c0\nr0\n\nr\n\n\u03c0\n) + \u03b7w r0 ,\n4n\n\n(11)\n\nwhere d is the particles' diameter and n is the area fraction. Two fitting parameters are \u03ba and r0 . The parameter\n\u03ba is related to the strength of the influence of Coulomb interaction on the effective surface viscosity. The parameter\nr0 is a intrinsic length of the interfacial system. Considering the definition of surface viscosity, r0 maybe related to\nthe length of the line that spheres contact with the interface. As an amplitude parameter, \u03ba should be related to\nthe surface charge, immerse depth and diameter of the particle, though no exact expression of \u03ba couldn't be given at\npresent. Here, we add an extra term of \u03b7w r0 as a correction to the theory of equation (7), since these silica spheres,\nespecially samples S1 and S3, experience a larger drag force than the value predicted by T.M.Fisher's theory [14].\nThis term of \u03b7w r0 represents the surface viscosity that one particle experiences at the air-water interface when n \u2192 0.\nThe solid lines in Fig. 9 are the fitted curves described by formula (11). The fitted values of parameters \u03ba and r0\nare given in table 1. The value of r0 for samples S1 is nearly 2 times larger than that of S3, and \u03ba close to 4 times in\nthe error range. These ratio between numbers are consistent well with the size ratio between the particles, considering\nthe underlying physical meaning of \u03ba and r0 , viz. surface charge and immerse contact line. But for samples S2, the\nvalues in table give a different story: a much larger \u03ba vs. a much less r0 . These two numbers are self consistent at\nleast. More surface charge (\u223d \u03ba) will give a shorter contact line (\u223d r0 ), since high charged particles always immerse\ndeeper. As mentioned above, the S2 particles were purchased from Bangs Laboratories, while S1 and S3 particles\nfrom Duke Scientific. Both were synthesized in different ways [14]. The difference in surface chemistry may introduce\na different immersion ratio.\n\n\f11\nTABLE I: q\nParticle sample used in the experiment and the fitted values of r0 and \u03ba from the measured effective surface viscosity\np\u03c0\n4n\n\u03ba\nexp(\u2212 rd0 4n\n) + \u03b7w r0 .\nd\n\u03c0\n\n\u03b7es,2p =\n\nSample/Manu.\nsilica 1 (S1)/Duke Sci.\nsilica 2 (S2)/Bangs Lab\nsilica 3 (S3)/Duke Sci.\n\nd(\u03bcm)\n1.57\u00b10.06\n0.97\u00b10.05\n0.73\u00b10.04\n\n\u03ba(cP \u03bcm2 )\n510\u00b184\n1500\u00b1800\n160\u00b134\n\nr0 (\u03bcm)\n1.13\u00b1 0.1\n0.30\u00b1 0.05\n0.67\u00b1 0.1\n\nAt a glance, this S2 immerse-deeper picture is sort of conflict with the fact that the Dss /D0 value of S2 (\u223d 1.5) is\nhigher than that of S1 and S3 (\u223d 1.2) when n \u2192 0 [14], viz. the particles S2 experience a relative less drag than S1\nand S3 on \u2032the air-water interface in the dilute \u2032limit. While n \u2192 0, the effective viscosity \u03b7e is composed of the bulk\nviscosity \u03b7w and interfacial viscosity \u03b7es = \u03b7w r0 . The short self-diffusion constant of particle could be written as:\nDss (n \u2192 0) =\n\nkB T\nkB T\n=\n\u2032 ,\n(0)\n\u03b7w + \u03b7es\n\u03b7w ak + \u03b7w r0\n\n(12)\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nwhere a is the particle radius, and r0 is the character length. The deeper the particles immerse, the larger the bulk\n\u2032\n\u2032\nviscosity \u03b7w contributes and the less the \u03b7es . Base on our data, the increase of \u03b7w might be overwhelmed by the\ndecrease\u2032 of \u03b7es when S2 immerse deeper.\nThe r0 in equation (12) should be same with the r0 appeared in equation (11), since both describe the interfacial\nviscosity\n\u03b7es when n \u2192 0. Regarding r0 as the length of interfacial particle contact line, we could calculate the value\n\u2032\nof r0 by substituting the fitting value of r0 (in table I) and the value of Dss (in paper [14]) into the formula (8) and\n\u2032\n(12). The calculation results show that r0 = 0.97 \u00b1 0.1\u03bcm, \u22120.87 \u00b1 0.1\u03bcm and 0.47 \u00b1 0.1\u03bcm for samples S1, S2 and\n\u2032\nS3, respectively. The deviation between r0 and r0 is less than 15 and 30 percent for sample S1 and S3, respectively.\n\u2032\nHowever, the sign of the r0 is negative for S2. With a long shot guess, it maybe because that the particle S2 has a\npartially slip boundary condition due to its unique surface chemistry. Then the fitting value of r0 is not the real length\nof particles contact line, but a viscosity-effect-equivalent one,\nwhich could much less than the real contact length. By\n\u2032\nthis underestimated r0 , we could have a overestimated \u03b7w due to a deeper-immersion estimation of z/a in equation\n\u2032\n(8). In the end, we get a minus r0 for sample S2. But at present, we are unable to experimentally measure the exact\nlength of the interfacial particle contact line independently. So we cannot say anything much more here.\nTraditionally, particle concentration dependence of the bulk viscosity (data points in Fig. 9) could be expressed by\nthe polynomial [19, 20]. By analogy with the bulk case, we rewrite the effective surface viscosity \u03b7es,2p as follows:\n\u03b7es,2p = \u03b7es0 (1 \u2212 n)\u2212\u03bc ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u03b7es0 and \u03bc are the fitting parameter. The parameter \u03b7es0 represents the effective surface viscosity that a sphere\nexperiences. The area fraction dependence of \u03b7es,2p is represented by \u03bc. The data points in Fig. 9 could also fitted\nvery well by equation (13). However, the fitted values of \u03bc are very high and \u03bc \u2243 12 \u2192 15, indicating \u03b7es,2p has a\nsuper strong area fraction dependence. Such incredible high power exponent suggests that \u03b7es,2p should exponentially\nincreases with colloidal area fraction. We believe that the strong area fraction dependence of \u03b7es,2p does arise from\nthe Coulomb interaction between particles.\nGenerally, figure 9 exhibits dependence of shear viscosity \u03b7es,2p on particle concentration, which is directly related\nto cross-correlation of interfacial diffusion. With the increase of area fraction, the mean particle separation decreases\nand the electrostatic interaction between particles enhances. The enhancement of the electrostatic interaction causes\nthe increase of correlated strength between particles. The increase of correlated strength corresponds to the increase\nof the effective surface viscosity \u03b7es,2p . We describe the electrostatic interaction between particles with the effective\nsurface viscosity \u03b7es,2p . There are hydrodynamic and electrostatic interaction between particles in our experimental\nsystem. We call this interaction effective hydrodynamic interaction. With the increase of n, the effective hydrodynamic\ninteraction enhances mainly arising from the increase of Coulomb interaction between particles. H. Diamant et al.\n[9, 21] had demonstrated that many-body effects do not influence the hydrodynamic coupling at large distance in quasitwo-dimension (Q2D) colloidal system for momentum diffusion does not contribute to the large-distance coupling.\nWe also observed that the hydrodynamic interaction between hard sphere is independent of particle concentration in\nthe two-dimension (2D) system where the momentum leaks to the third dimension [22].\nAnother information given by Fig. 9 is size dependence of \u03b7es,2p . First, we study the behavior of the shear viscosity\n\u03b7es,2p for particles S1 and S3 both which were purchased from Duke Scientific with identical surface chemistry. It is\n\n\f12\nshown that for the same area fraction the shear viscosity \u03b7es,2p of small particles is slightly larger than that of large\nparticles, i.e., small particles experience ap\nlarger drag than large particles. One possibility is that smaller particles\nare separated by a smaller distance (l = d \u03c0/(4n)) as compared to the larger particles at the same area fraction n,\nand they may feel more effective hydrodynamic interactions at air-water interface than the larger particles do [23\u201325].\nCompared with particles S1 and S3 ,the S2 particles has very small shear viscosity \u03b7es,2p , as mentioned above, which\nmaybe come from the different surface chemistry.\nFigure 3 (b) shows an anomalous long-rang correlation. While R > 5d, the decay of < Drr /\u03c4 > and < D\u03b8\u03b8 /\u03c4 >\nbates with increasing R and does not follow power law. At large inter-particle region, correlated motion are weakly\ndependent on R and are roughly logarithmic (too narrow data range to tell, indeed). The deviation of correlated\nmotion from the master curve in the case of R > 5d indicates another rules governed the system or something else?\nAt present, we don't have an answer yet. During the experiment, we use 10-100 image sequences, each contains\n100 images, to calculate Drr and D\u03b8\u03b8 , and the result is further averaged over repeated runs (10\u221220 runs). This\ncorresponds to an average over 106 \u2212 107 particles, ensuring that the statistical averaging is adequate. We conduct the\nmeasurements at different times with separately prepared air-water interface. The identical experiment equipments\nand measurement methods are used for all the three particle samples. Thus, this anomalous long-rang interaction\nsounds unlikely caused by inaccurate measurements. But this anomalous correlation occurs only at smallest colloidal\nS3 system. The diffusion constants of S3 particles is relative larger than two others samples due to the smaller\nsize. An improved microscopy system with even higher time and spacial resolution might be necessary to clarify this\nphenomenon.\nV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn this paper, we systematically investigated the spatial correlated motion of weakly charged silica spheres at a\npure air-water interface. Three kinds of silica particles are used in the experiment: silica 1 (S1) with the diameter\nd = 1.57\u03bcm purchased from Duke Scientific, silica 2 (S2) with the diameter d = 0.97\u03bcm purchased from Bangs\nLaboratories and silica 3 (S3) with the diameter d = 0.73\u03bcm purchased from Duke Scientific. Optical microscopy\nand multi-particle tracking are used to measure Drr /\u03c4 and D\u03b8\u03b8 /\u03c4 as a function of the inter-particle distance R with\nvarious values of particle concentration for particles S1, S2 and S3. Correlation function Drr /\u03c4 and D\u03b8\u03b8 /\u03c4 decay\nwith inter-particle distance R as 1/R0.86\u00b10.02 and 1/R1.45\u00b10.03 , respectively, for particles S1 with n = 0.03. With\nthe increase of n, the decay of correlated motion with R becomes slow (Fig. 1 and 2). We attribute it as that the\ncross correlation is enhanced by the Coulomb interaction between particles. We describe the electrostatic interaction\nbetween particles at the interface with the effective surface viscosity \u03b7es .\nFollowing the scaling method given by Prasad et al. [10], we scale the curves with various values of n onto a single\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\nmaster curve by \u03b7es and \u03b7es . The measurements results show that \u03b7es is clearly deviated from \u03b7es for a certain area\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\nfraction (Fig. 5). The discrepancy between \u03b7es and \u03b7es even exceeds 50 percent in the case of large n. The dependence\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nof \u03b7es on \u03b7es suggests that we should rescale the separation according to formula (4). With this new scaling method\nthe curves with different area fraction can be scaled onto a single master curve by one set of parameter values of\ntwo-particle effective viscosity \u03b7es,2p (Fig. 6). The measurements of effective surface viscosity \u03b7es,2p and \u03b7es,1p agree\nwell with each other (Fig. 8). The behaviors of cross correlation for particles S1, S2 and S3 are similar and their\nmaster curve can also fall on a single curve except the large R region of S3 (Fig. 7). The experimental results indicate\nthat our new scaling method is reasonable and could be used in similar experiment system. But presently we do\nnot deduce theoretically the scaling relationship described in formula (4), which deserves further investigation, and\nalso cannot understand the anomalous long-rang correlation exhibited by particles S3 at large inter-particle distance\nregion (Fig.3 (b)).\nThe effective surface viscosity \u03b7es,2p as a function of n for samples S1, S2 and S3 are presented (Fig. 9). For samples\nS1 and S3 with identical surface chemistry, \u03b7es,2p of small particles is slightly larger than that of large one for the\nsame area fraction. However, the viscosity \u03b7es,2p of particles S2 is extraordinary small compared with that of S1 and\nS3. The difference of surface chemistry characteristic and immersion depth between particles S1, S3 and S2 may be\nthe two possibilities causing the discrepancy of the viscosity \u03b7es,2p . The experimental data about the effective surface\nviscosity \u03b7es,2p presented in the paper are helpful for the related theoretical investigation. Referring to the form of\nthe interaction potential between particles, we present a exponential fitting formula (equation (11)), which is more\nphysically reasonable than the traditional polynomial form, for the viscosity \u03b7es,2p .\nThe decay of the correlated motion with R for lowest n in this paper is slower than that of Ref.[10] with low surface\nviscosity. We argue that the high sensitivity of electrostatic interaction between particles on area fraction results in\nthis deviation. With the increase of n, the electrostatic interaction enhances and the slope of correlated motion vs.\nR decreases, which confirm our argument. We increase the Coulomb interaction between particle by increasing the\narea fraction n. Though we have known that many-body effects would not influence the hydrodynamic interaction\n\n\f13\nof particles, the method varying Coulomb interaction between particles in the paper is indirect. We will change the\nsurface charge of particles directly to investigate the effects of Coulomb interaction on correlated motion in the next\nexperiment to further confirm our argument.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n\nG.
