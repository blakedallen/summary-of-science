A modified cluster algorithm has\nbeen introduced to simulate the model with imaginary \u03b8. Two different definitions of the topological charge on the lattice have been used;\none of them needs renormalization to match the continuum operator.\nOur work also offers a successful test for numerical methods based on\nanalytic continuation.\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nSeveral years ago Zamolodchikov and Zamolodchikov introduced an integrable S\u2013matrix for massless particles which was associated to the 2\u2013dimensional O(3) non\u2013linear sigma model with a topological \u03b8 term for \u03b8 = \u03c0 [1].\nTherefore the 2\u2013dimensional O(3) sigma model with \u03b8 = \u03c0 is possibly\ngapless. Actually this conclusion was previously achieved by Haldane and\nAffleck. They worked out a low energy description of the 1\u2013dimensional chain\nof quantum half\u2013integer spin with antiferromagnetic coupling finding that it\nand the above\u2013mentioned O(3) sigma model share the same long distance\nproperties [2, 3, 4]. Moreover it was found that antiferromagnetic quantum\nspin chains are gapless for half\u2013integer spins [2, 5].\nLater Affleck and Haldane [6] argued that the critical theory for the half\u2013\ninteger quantum antiferromagnetic spin chain is the Wess\u2013Zumino\u2013Witten\nmodel with a topological coupling k = 1. This model is the stable fixed\npoint of the 2\u2013dimensional O(3) sigma model with a vacuum angle \u03b8 = \u03c0.\nIn addition, two numerical calculations of the partition function for the\nO(3) model in the presence of a \u03b8 term [7] yield indications that the theory undergoes a second order phase transition at \u03b8 = \u03c0 (although the two\nanalyses disagree about the universality class).\nIn the present work we introduce a direct numerical method to verify the\nHaldane conjecture for the 2\u2013dimensional O(3) non\u2013linear sigma model. The\nidea is to perform a Monte Carlo study on the lattice of the mass gap in the\nmodel as a function of the \u03b8 parameter and to show that it vanishes at a\nprecise value of \u03b8, called \u03b8end , which, following Haldane, should be \u03b8end =\n\u03c0. We overcome the sign problem by simulating the theory at imaginary \u03b8\nand analytically continuing the results to the real \u03b8 values. To this end we\nintroduce a new cluster algorithm that works for imaginary non\u2013zero theta.\n\n2\n\nLattice implementation\n\nThe continuum expression for the action of the model is\nS = A \u2212 i\u03b8Q ,\nQ =\n\nZ\n\n1\nA=\n2g\n\nd2 x Q(x) ,\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u0010\n\n~\nd2 x \u2202\u03bc \u03c6(x)\n\n\u00112\n\n,\n\n\fQ(x) \u2261\n\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\n\u01eb \u01ebabc \u03c6a (x)\u2202\u03bc \u03c6b (x)\u2202\u03bd \u03c6c (x) ,\n8\u03c0\n\n(1)\n\nwhere g is the coupling constant and Q(x) is the topological charge density.\n~\n\u03c6(x)\nis a 3\u2013component unit vector that represents the dynamical variable\nat the site x. We have regularized this action on a square lattice by the\nexpression\nSL = AL \u2212 i\u03b8L QL ,\n\nAL \u2261 \u2212\u03b2\n\nX\nx,\u03bc\n\nP\n\n~\n~ + \u03bc)\nb ,\n\u03c6(x)\n* \u03c6(x\n\n(2)\n\nwhere QL = x QL (x) is the total lattice topological charge and QL (x) is\nthe lattice topological charge density. \u03b2 is the inverse bare lattice coupling\nconstant and \u03b8L is the bare vacuum angle. In general, \u03b8L 6= \u03b8 and the point\nwhere the lattice regularized model becomes massless will be called \u03b8L,end .\nThe action AL used in (2) is the simplest one on the lattice. More complicated actions and expansion parameters boast better scaling and asymptotic scaling properties and hence they are more suited for the calculation of\nmasses [8, 9, 10]. However our interest lies only on the vanishing of the mass\ngap at a particular value of \u03b8L and such a property is clearly unaffected by\nthe slow convergence of the series.\n\n3\n\nChoice of QL\n\nLet us discuss the regularization of the topological charge density to be used\nin our Monte Carlo simulation. Q counts how many times the configuration\nof spin variables winds around the unit sphere. Hence Q takes on integer\nvalues. Configurations with +1 (\u22121) winding number are called instantons\n(anti\u2013instantons) [11].\nWe have made use of two different lattice regularizations for the topological charge density. The first one [12]\n(1)\n\nQL (x) \u2261\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\nb \u2212 \u03c6b (x \u2212 \u03bc)\nb *\n\u01eb \u01ebabc \u03c6a (x) \u03c6b (x + \u03bc)\n\u001032\u03c0\n\u0011\n\u03c6c (x + \u03bdb) \u2212 \u03c6c (x \u2212 \u03bdb) ,\n\n(3)\n\nis a symmetrical discretization of the expression for Q(x) in Eq.(1).\nThe second lattice regularization is defined on triangles (not on single\nsites). Every plaquette of a square lattice can be cut through a diagonal\n3\n\n\f~1, \u03c6\n~ 2 and \u03c6\n~ 3 the fields at the sites of the\ninto two triangles. If we call \u03c6\nthree vertices (numbered counter\u2013clockwise) of one of these triangles then\n(2)\nthe fraction of spherical angle subtended by these fields is QL (\u25b3) which\nsatisfies [13]\n\u0010\n\n(2)\n\n\u0011\n\nexp 2\u03c0iQL (\u25b3) =\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0011\n1\u0010\n~1 * \u03c6\n~2 + \u03c6\n~2 * \u03c6\n~3 + \u03c6\n~3 * \u03c6\n~ 1 + i\u03c6\n~1 * \u03c6\n~ 2 \u00d7 \u03c6~3 , (4)\n1+\u03c6\n\u03c1\n\n~1 * \u03c6\n~ 2 )(1 + \u03c6\n~2 * \u03c6\n~ 3)(1 + \u03c6\n~3 * \u03c6\n~ 1 ) and Q(2) (\u25b3) \u2208 [\u2212 1 , + 1 ]. The\nwhere \u03c12 \u2261 2(1 + \u03c6\nL\n2\n2\n(2)\nsum of QL (\u25b3) over all triangles yields the so\u2013called geometric topological\n(2)\ncharge QL .\nIn general, a regularization of Q does not lead to integer values on a\nsingle configuration. To recover integer results for QL on ensembles of configurations that belong to the same topological sector, we must renormalize\nthis operator. The lattice and the continuum topological charges are related\nby [14]\n(1,2)\n(1,2)\nQL = ZQ Q ,\n(5)\n(1,2)\n\nZQ being the corresponding renormalization constant which is UV finite\nsince the topological charge operator has no anomalous dimensions in the\nmodel under study.\n(1,2)\nZQ can be calculated either in perturbation theory [14] or by a non\u2013\nperturbative numerical method [15]. We have used the latter. In a nutshell\nit works in the following way: a classical instanton (with topological charge\n+1) is put by hand on the lattice and then 100 updating steps are applied\n(we used the Heat\u2013Bath algorithm on the conventional O(3) non\u2013linear \u03c3\nmodel without a \u03b8 term since the renormalization constant to be used in\n(1,2)\nEq.(5) cannot depend on \u03b8). After every Heat\u2013Bath step the value of QL\nis measured and, in order to monitor the background charge and check that it\n(1,2)\nis not varied after the updating step, QL is measured again after 6 cooling\n(1)\nhits. In the calculation of ZQ this procedure was repeated 4 * 104 times at\n(1,2)\n\u03b2 = 1.5 and 1.6 and 104 times for \u03b2 = 1.7 and 1.75. The average of QL on\n(1,2)\nconfigurations within the topological sector +1 yields ZQ .\nThe above non\u2013perturbative method is summarized by the expression\n(1,2)\nZQ\n\n=\n\nR\n\n(1,2)\n\n1\u2212instanton\n\nR\n\n~Q\nD\u03c6\nexp (\u2212AL )\nL\n.\n~ exp (\u2212AL )\nD\u03c6\n\n1\u2212instanton\n\n4\n\n(6)\n\n\fThe restricted path integral runs over all configurations (fluctuations) that\n(2)\npreserve the background of one instanton. Since the geometric charge QL\nis +1 till the background classical configuration is one instanton (whatever\n(2)\nthe fluctuations are), the expression (6) yields ZQ = 1 for all \u03b2 [16].\n(1)\nThe determination of ZQ is not so trivial and an example of such an\n(1)\nevaluation is shown in Fig.1. Measures of QL on configurations that belong\nto the topological sector +1 attain to a plateau (in general after a few Heat\u2013\nBath steps) and stay on it for the rest of the updating steps. The height of\n(1)\n(1)\nthis plateau is the value of ZQ . In Table 1 the results for ZQ at the values\nof \u03b2 used in the present work are given.\n\n1.0\n0.8\n(1)\n<QL >\n\n0.6\n\n\u03b2=1.5\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nHeat-Bath steps\n(1)\n\nFigure 1: Data for hQL i start at +1 at the 0\u2013th Heat\u2013Bath step and then\nthey go down until reaching a plateau. The horizontal line and grey band\n(1)\nare the value and error respectively of ZQ (\u03b2 = 1.5).\nThe relevant consequence of the above considerations for our study is that\nthe vacuum angle \u03b8 is related to the corresponding bare parameter by the\n(1,2)\n(2)\nexpression \u03b8 = \u03b8L ZQ (which implies \u03b8 = \u03b8L when QL is used).\n\n5\n\n\f4\n\nCluster algorithm for imaginary \u03b8\n(1)\n\nAlthough the use of the topological charge density QL requires the knowledge of a renormalization constant, it brings about the advantage that the\naction SL in (2) can be simulated on the lattice by use of a fast cluster al(2)\ngorithm. Instead when the geometric charge QL was used, the model was\nupdated by a (rather slow) Metropolis algorithm.\nLet us briefly describe the main characteristics of the new cluster algorithm expressly devised for the present work. The first part of an updating\nstep with the usual Wolff algorithm [17] for the standard O(3) sigma model\nwithout a \u03b8 term consists in choosing a random unit vector ~r in such a way\nthat every dynamical\nfield\nr and\n\u0010\n\u0011 can be split in a component parallel to ~\n~\n~\n~\n~\n~\nthe rest, \u03c6(x) = \u03c6(x) * ~r ~r + \u03c6\u22a5 (x), where \u03c6\u22a5 (x) denotes the part of \u03c6(x)\n\u0010\n\u0011\n~\northogonal to ~r.

Recall that all Monte Carlo simulations have\nbeen performed with an imaginary vacuum angle \u03b8L = +i\u03b8L , (\u03b8L \u2208\n\u0010 IR). By\n\u0011\n~\ngathering all contributions of the type shown in Eq.(7) that contain \u03c6(x)\n* ~r\n6\n\n\fat site x one can readily derive the effective magnetic field at this site,\n\n+\n\n\u0010\n\u03b8L ~\n|\u03c6(x) * ~r | d1,2 + d\u22121,\u22122 + d2,\u22121 + d\u22122,1\n16\u03c0\nd\u22121,\u22121\u22122 + d\u22121+2,\u22121 + d1,1+2 + d1\u22122,1\n\n+\n\nd2,2\u22121 + d2+1,2 + d\u22122,\u22122+1 + d\u22122\u22121,\u22122 .\n\nh(x) = \u2212\n\n\u0011\n\n(9)\n\ndi+k,j (and analogous terms in (9)) are the straightforward generalization of\nthe above definition (8) when the site is obtained by shifting two steps from\nthe original position x, the first in the direction bi and the second in the\ndirection kb .\nHence the last step in the updating consists in applying to the above\nexpressions an algorithm valid for the Ising model in presence of a magnetic field. In the literature there are two such algorithms, the Lauwers\u2013\nRittenberg [19] and the Wang [20, 21] methods. After testing their perfomances and comparing the corresponding decorrelation times with the usual\n(multihit) Metropolis, Heat\u2013Bath and overHeat\u2013Bath, we decided for the\nWang algorithm. It consists in placing the magnetic field on an extra, fictitious site (called ghost site) that couples to every Ising spin through the\nvalue of h(x). Using this coupling on the same footing as all other terms in\nthe action, the Fortuin\u2013Kasteleyn clusters [22] are arranged by the Hoshen\u2013\nKopelman algorithm [23] and then updated with the usual 21 probability.\nFollowing the proof given in [17], it can be seen that our algorithm also\nsatisfies the detailed balance property.\n\n5\n\nResults\n\nOperators representing physical states can be built out of an arbitrary number of fundamental fields since supposedly the model is not parity invariant\nfor \u03b8L 6= 0.

Main plot: circles (\u03b2 = 1.5), up triangles (\u03b2 = 1.6), squares\n(\u03b2 = 1.7) and down triangles (\u03b2 = 1.75) are the data from the simulation at\n(1)\nimaginary \u03b8L (\u03b8L2 < 0) by using the QL lattice regularized topological charge.\nEach continuous line is the result of the extrapolation described in the text\nand the dashed lines enclose the boundary of its error. Inset: the same for\n(2)\nthe QL regularization: squares (\u03b2 = 1.5) and up triangles (\u03b2 = 1.55).

The extrapolations in this figure were done by using the functional form (c1 + c2 \u03b8L2 )/(1 + c3 \u03b8L2 ). We avoided using a functional form\ndictated by some theoretical argument, like one that for real or imaginary \u03b8L\ngoes like m(\u03b8L ) = c1 (c22 \u2212 \u03b8L2 )2/3 which is, up to logarithmic corrections, the\nRenormalization Group prediction, because such an analytic form implicitly\nassumes the vanishing of the mass at a precise value of \u03b8. Instead we made\nthe extrapolations with ratios of polynomials (which are contemporaneously\nboth simple and very general functional forms) in order to leave room for any\nbehaviour in the vacuum angle. The results of the analytic continuations are\ngiven in Table 1. The physical value of \u03b8 where the theory becomes gapless is\n(1)\ngiven by \u03b8end = \u03b8L,end ZQ . The numbers in the last column are in fair agreement with the prediction that the model becomes massless when \u03b8 equals \u03c0.\nSimilar results (and \u03c72 ) were obtained from degree 2 or 3 polynomials in \u03b8L2 ,\nwhile ratios of higher order polynomials proved to be statistically unlikely\n(their \u03c72 was too large).\n(1)\n\nTable 1.

Once this inequality holds at \u03b8L = 0, it is\namply realized at the values of \u03b8L where the simulations were performed as\ninferred from Fig.2. This fact warrants the absence of significant finite size\neffects.\n\n5.2\n\n(2)\n\nResults for QL\n\nIn this case a Metropolis algorithm was used for updating and 105 independent propagators were measured for each value of \u03b8 (recall that in the present\ncase \u03b8L = \u03b8). We report data for two values of \u03b2. They are displayed in the\n9\n\n\finset of Fig.2. The value of \u03b8 where Haldane predicted the closing of the\nmass gap is indicated with an arrow, \u03b82 = \u03c0 2 . The numerical results are\n(1)\ngiven in Table 2. Comments similar to the QL case apply to the extrapolations shown in the figure. Again the results are in fair agreement with the\nconjecture.\n(2)\n\nTable 2. \u03b8end for the operator QL .\n\u03b2\n1.5\n1.55\n\nL\n110\n150\n\n(\u03b8end )2\n10.4(1.0)\n9.7(1.0)\n\n\u03c72 /d.o.f.\n1.72\n0.73\n\n\u03b8end\n3.22(16)\n3.11(16)\n\nBy averaging all results for both topological charge operators and assuming gaussian errors we obtain that the mass gap vanishes at \u03b8end = 3.10(5).\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have simulated the O(3) non\u2013linear sigma model in 2 dimensions with an\nimaginary \u03b8 term at several values of the lattice coupling \u03b2. The mass gap\nwas measured and extrapolated towards real \u03b8. In all cases the extrapolation\nvanished at a value of \u03b8 compatible with the Haldane conjecture \u03b8 = \u03c0. Our\nresult is \u03b8 = 3.10(5) which agrees within errors with the conjecture. This\nvalue seems very robust as it is independent of the topological charge density\n(1)\noperator chosen for the simulation. In particular, an operator QL that\nrequires a non\u2013trivial renormalization constant leads to the same conclusion\n(2)\nthan another operator (the geometric charge QL ) that does not renormalize.\nA new fast cluster algorithm was purposely introduced to simulate the\n(1)\ntheory with an imaginary \u03b8 term. It works for the operator QL . Instead,\n(2)\nwhen the geometric topological charge QL was used, the theory was simulated by a (rather slow) Metropolis algorithm.\nA salient outcome of our work is the good performance of the analytic continuation from imaginary to real \u03b8. No theoretical prejudices were assumed\nin the functional form used in the continuation, apart from the obvious requirement that it is analytic. This can be justified by a comparison with the\n\n10\n\n\fphase diagram shown in Ref. [26]. In the case of the geometrical charge our\nlargest \u03b2 and \u03b8 = \u03b8L (1.55 and 3.5 respectively) are very far from the line\n(1)\n(1)\nof phase transitions; as for the QL case, our largest \u03b2 and \u03b8 = \u03b8L ZQ were\n1.75 and 4.1, which again lie very far from any line of singular points.\nThe need to perform Monte Carlo simulations at imaginary values of \u03b8\nis actually a blessing in disguise since it forced us to work at very small\ncorrelation lengths, as can be clearly seen in Fig.2. Had we studied the\ntheory directly at real \u03b8 values, we would have met with severe finite size\neffects.\nA key ingredient for the successful extrapolation was to have got data\nfrom simulations within a wide range of (imaginary) values of \u03b8L for all \u03b2,\n(1)\n(\u03b8L \u2261 \u2212i\u03b8L \u2208 [0, 10] when QL was used and \u03b8L = \u03b8 \u2261 \u2212i\u03b8 \u2208 [0, 3.5]\n(2)\nfor QL , the difference of intervals being due to the effect of the non\u2013trivial\nrenormalization that must be applied to the former). All that looks encouraging for the numerical studies based on the analytic continuation with\nrespect to a parameter in the theory, such as in QCD with non\u2013zero chemical\npotential [27].\n\n7\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank Ettore Vicari and Adriano Di Giacomo for a critical reading of a\npreliminary draft of the paper and Giuseppe Mussardo for illuminating conversations.
