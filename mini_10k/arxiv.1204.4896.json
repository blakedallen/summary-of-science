Introduction\nTraditionally, the theory of evolution has been developed by analyzing phenotypes and\ngenotypes found in natural populations and fossil records [1, 2]. However, due to\nrecent developments in microbiology and modern genetics, evolutionary experiments\nare becoming a valuable research tool [3]. Laboratory experiments hold great promise\nfor uncovering basic evolutionary mechanisms by allowing us to observe evolution\nover time. More important, experiments, unlike evolution in natural populations,\ncan be repeated systematically to distinguish between general principles and historical\naccidents. Microbes are particularly suited for evolutionary studies because they are\nrelatively simple, reproduce and evolve rapidly, and can be easily modified using genetic\nengineering. Experiments with microorganisms could also provide insights into tumor\ngrowth, the spread of antibiotic resistance, and directed evolution of microbes to produce\nmedicines or biofuels [4, 5].\nOne potential drawback of evolutionary experiments is that they are conducted in\nartificial laboratory environments, which are quite different from the natural ecology\nof the species studied. The choice of the laboratory environment is therefore very\nimportant because it could affect both the nature of observed adaptations and the\nevolutionary dynamics. Most microbial experiments, of interest to us here, are\nconducted in the well-mixed environments of a chemostat or a test tube. These wellcontrolled environments allow researchers to compare experimental results to theoretical\npredictions, but it is important to ensure that such results are generic, not environment\nspecific. Spatial structure, absent in well-mixed cultures, can significantly affect\nevolutionary dynamics [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]; therefore, it is important to carry out experiments\nwith growth conditions that allow spatial inhomogeneities to form. The surface of a Petri\ndish is an easy-to-use environment, chemically similar to the environments of a test\ntube or a chemostat, yet capable of sustaining and preserving spatial structure during\ncolony growth. Recently, several studies have used microorganisms in Petri dishes to\nstudy spatial patterning, mutations, and evolution [11, 12, 13, 4, 14, 15, 8, 16, 17,\n18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. Our focus here is on compact growth of colonies containing different\ngenetic variants. For a comprehensive review emphasizing the beautiful dendritic growth\npatterns that can arise at low nutrient concentrations see Ref. [23].\nAn important obstacle to a wider use of spatial environments in evolutionary\nexperiments is the limited theoretical understanding of how basic evolutionary processes\nplay out in a spatial context. In particular, one must have a way to measure fitness\nto study evolution, but there are few models that relate microscopic parameters of the\norganisms to macroscopic quantities that can be easily measured in the laboratory. In\nthis paper, we formulate a coarse-grained model of spatial competition that fills this gap\nand carry out microbial experiments to test the model's predictions. This model is based\non deterministic reaction-diffusion equations, which describe short-range migration of\nthe organisms and their competition. Our numerical results are further supported by a\ngeometric argument, which does not rely on the detailed assumptions about microbial\n\n\fSelective sweeps in growing microbial colonies\n\n4\n\ngrowth and migration. Stochastic effects due to number fluctuations (genetic drift)\ncan be included in the model [15, 24, 25], but they do not play a central role in our\nanalysis and are neglected for simplicity. For a study of spatial competition between two\nneutral bacterial strains, which is dominated by genetic drift, see Ref. [17]. Although\nwe focus on competitions, the model is sufficiently general to describe mutualistic and\nantagonistic interactions as well.\nCompared to well-mixed populations, spatial populations have a wide range of\ninitial conditions because one has to specify not only the relative fractions of genotypes\nbut also their spatial distribution at time zero. We examine several experimentally\ninteresting initial conditions and calculate how the spatial distributions of genotypes\nchanges with time. We find that the shape of the resulting spatio-genetic patterns is\ndetermined by the expansion velocities ratio v1 /v2 , where v1 and v2 are the expansion\nvelocities of isolated colonies composed exclusively of strain 1 or strain 2. Relative\nfitnesses of the genotypes can then be estimated by comparing experimentally observed\nspatio-genetic patterns to the theory. In particular, the selective advantage in this\ncontext can be defined as s = v1 /v2 \u2212 1. As we show below, this definition is\nclosely related to the traditional definition in terms of exponential growth rates. For\nlinear inoculations, our results in the long time limit agree with Ref. [24], where a\nphenomenological model of the patterns was first proposed. In contrast to Ref. [24],\nwe also study circular inoculations and carry out experiments to test quantitative\npredictions of our model.\nThe theory can be directly compared to the experiments because the spatial\ndistribution of genotypes on a Petri dish can be visualized and quantified with fluorescent\nmarkers [15]. Here, we briefly describe this technique; see the supplementary information\n(section S1) for more details. Microbial strains of interest are genetically modified to\nconstitutively produce a fluorescent protein. The emission spectra of the proteins must\nbe sufficiently different in order to distinguish the strains on a Petri dish. To study\nselective sweeps, a mixture of the strains is prepared in liquid medium, usually with\nthe fitter strain in the minority. A drop of this mixture is then deposited on a small\nregion of a Petri dish with solid growth medium. Different shapes of this drop lead to\ndifferent initial conditions. Circular drops are naturally created by the surface tension\nforces when small drops of fluid are placed on a Petri dish. Linear drops can be created\nby gently touching the surface of the medium with a razor blade after dipping it in the\nmixture of the strains. These drops dry quickly, and microbial colonies start to grow,\nexpanding by about a centimeter a week. The spatial distribution of genotypes can be\nobserved during this expansion by fluorescent microscopy, as shown in figure 1.\nSectors in figure 1 are at the center of this study. In our experiments, cells are\nnonmotile and grow primarily at the expanding frontier; behind the front, the growth\nis limited by the lack of nutrients [27, 28]. As a result, the genetic composition in the\ninterior of the colony does not change with time. The spatio-genetic pattern shown in\nfigure 1 is then a frozen record of the temporal changes in the spatial distribution of\ngenotypes at the expanding frontier. In figure 1a, we show growth of two strains with\n\n\fSelective sweeps in growing microbial colonies\n\n5\n\nFigure 1. (Colour online) Comparison of spatial segregation during a range expansion\nof Baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae with (a) equal and (b) different growth\nrates of the two competing strains. The Petri dishes were inoculated with a wellmixed population occupying a narrow horizontal linear region at the bottom of the\nimages from which the sectors appear. As the populations expand, they segregate\ninto well defined domains. Different colours label different genotypes. In (a), the two\nstrains (yellow and blue) have the same fitness and the demixing is driven primarily\nby number fluctuations (genetic drift) [15, 6]. It is likely that the small variations with\nhorizontal position in boundary slopes are related to undulations of linear fronts, which\nare hard to suppress when the front is very long [26]. In (b), the sector is formed by\nthe fitter strain (black), and the sector expansion is caused by the difference in growth\nrates of the strains, or, in other words, by natural selection. In both (a) and (b), the\nscale bars are 500 \u03bcm.\n\nFigure 2. (Colour online) Colony edge at single cell resolution (mature yeast cells are\n5 \u03bcm in diameter).

Note the formation of a green (light gray) sector on the lower right. The\ntwo strains have approximately the same fitness in this experiment.\n\nthe same fitness that differ only in the colour of a fluorescent marker. Before deposition\non the Petri dish, these strains were combined in a 1:50 ratio and thoroughly mixed.\nHowever, the two different colours (genotypes) demix and form sectors. This demixing\nis caused by number fluctuations (genetic drift) at the expanding edge [15, 6]. One\ncan see this stochastic process at the resolution of a single cell (5 \u03bcm in diameter)\nin figure 2. In contrast to neutral demixing, figure 1b shows sector formation in a\ncolony founded by two strains with different fitnesses; the fitter strain is in the minority\n\n\fSelective sweeps in growing microbial colonies\n\n6\n\ninitially. Over time, the fitter strain displaces the other strain, increasing its share of\nthe expanding frontier. This expansion is also subject to number fluctuations, which\nare responsible for the sector boundary wiggles, but the average shape of the sector is\ndetermined primarily by the deterministic force of natural selection. For the purpose\nof measuring relative fitness, the effects of genetic drift can be averaged out, given a\nsufficient number of repeated experiments. Our deterministic model strives to describe\nthis average sector shape and is not capable of describing the randomness in boundary\nmotion or the dynamics when the number of the fitter organisms is so small that the\nnumber fluctuations can lead to their extinction, an effect discussed in Ref. [24].\nThis paper is organized as follows. We formulate a competition model assuming a\nwell-mixed environment, such as a mechanically shaken test tube, in Sec. 2. Under\nthese conditions, a particular microbe visits virtually every region of the carrier\nfluid in a cell division time, and the system is effectively \"zero-dimensional.\" This\nmodel is then extended to account for lateral migrations during a range expansion\nin Sec. 3. In Sec. 4, we analytically derive the spatial patterns created by twospecies competition (including results for colliding circular colonies) using a very general\nargument, which does not rely on the microscopic details of microbial growth and\nmigration. The theoretical predictions are then compared to experiments in Sec. 5.\nConcluding remarks are contained in Sec. 6. The supplementary information (section S1)\ncontains the experimental and numerical methods as well as additional data supporting\nour conclusions.\n2. Modeling competition in a well-mixed environment\nA competition experiment is a standard way to measure relative fitness of two microbial\nstrains in a well-mixed environment. During a competition experiment, the stains are\nintroduced into a fresh medium, and their relative abundance is measured over time.\nInitially, the number of cells grows exponentially, but the growth eventually slows down\nas the system approaches the stationary phase due to crowded conditions. This behavior\nis captured by a simple Lotka-Volterra-type model [29]:\n\uf8f1\nd\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 c1 (t) = g1 c1 (t) \u2212 d11 c21 (t) \u2212 d12 c1 (t)c2 (t),\ndt\n(1)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 d c2 (t) = g2 c2 (t) \u2212 d21 c2 (t)c1 (t) \u2212 d22 c2 (t),\n2\ndt\nwhich is the most general model with quadratic nonlinearities. Here, c1 (t) and c2 (t)\nare the concentrations (number of cells per unit volume) of strain 1 and strain 2\nrespectively. The constants g1 and g2 are their exponential growth rates; and the\nconstant matrix dij > 0 describes nonlinear interactions. For a mono-culture consisting\nof a single yeast strain, Refs. [30, 31] showed that population growth can be described\nby the logistic equation (i.e. with quadratic nonlinearities) very accurately.\n\n\fSelective sweeps in growing microbial colonies\nC2\n\nC2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n0\n\n7\n\n1\n\n0\n\nC1\n\nC2\n\nC2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nC1\n\n1\n\nC1\n\ng replacements\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n> 0,\n> 0,\n< 0,\n< 0,\n\n\u01eb2\n\u01eb2\n\u01eb2\n\u01eb2\n\n>0\n<0\n>0\n(c)\n<0 0\n\n(d)\n1\n\nC1\n\n0\n\nFigure 3.

Our notation emphasizes that\nthe initial stage of exponential growth is usually much shorter than the second phase\nof competition under crowded conditions, i.e. the growth rates g1 > 0 and g2 > 0, are\ntypically much larger than the small quantities |\u01eb1 | and |\u01eb2 |. When \u01ebi > 0, strain i grows\nfaster in the presence of the other strain, e.g. by feeding off an excess production of\na useful amino acid. When \u01ebi < 0, strain i grows slower in the presence of the other\nstrain, e.g., because of a secreted poison.\nNote that equations (2) always have at least three fixed points: (0, 0), (1, 0),\nand (0, 1). In addition, for some values of the parameters, there is another fixed\npoint (c\u22171 , c\u22172 ) in the physically relevant domain of nonnegative c1 and c2 . The fixed\npoint at the origin is always unstable.\nFive different behaviors are possible depending on the values of \u01eb1 and \u01eb2 ; four of\nthese are illustrated in figure 3. If \u01eb1 and \u01eb2 are positive, the interaction of the species\nis mutualistic (i.e. the presence of the first strain helps the second strain grow and vice\nversa) and leads to a single stable fixed point (c\u22171 , c\u22172 ) with a nonzero concentration of\nboth strains. Since the focus of this paper is on competition, we do not pursue this\n\n\fSelective sweeps in growing microbial colonies\n\n8\n\nFigure 4. (Colour online) Solutions of equation (2) plotted in phase space (c1 , c2 ) for\nnegative \u01eb1 and positive \u01eb2 . The arrows indicate the direction of time. For the initial\nconditions, we chose positive c1 (0) and c2 (0) close to zero with each trajectory having\na different value of c1 (0)/c2 (0). In this plot, g1 = 1.5, g2 = 1, \u01eb1 = \u22120.1, \u01eb2 = 0.6.\nNote that, initially, all trajectories bend toward the c1 -axis (increasing c1 /c2 ), but the\nfirst strain is nevertheless eliminated at long times, as the system approaches the stable\nfixed point (0, 1).\n\ncooperative possibility further here. If \u01eb1 and \u01eb2 are negative, there are two stable fixed\npoints: one with c1 = 1 and c2 = 0, the other with c1 = 0 and c2 = 1. The system\nreaches one of these fixed points depending on which strain is more prevalent initially.\nAn incoming separatrix divides the phase space in two domains of attraction and feeds\ninto an unstable fixed point with c\u22171 > 0 and c\u22172 > 0. If \u01eb1 > 0 and \u01eb2 < 0, there is only\none stable fixed point c1 = 1 and c2 = 0. Similarly, c1 = 0 and c2 = 1 is the only stable\nfixed point when \u01eb1 < 0 and \u01eb2 > 0. Finally, there is a degenerate case \u01eb1 = \u01eb2 = 0 when\nthe dynamics is determined only by the logistical growth. In this case, depending on\nthe initial conditions, the system lands somewhere along the line of neutral fixed points\ndefined by c1 + c2 = 1.\nInterestingly, when \u01eb1 \u01eb2 < 0, the ultimate result of the competition is independent\nof the exponential growth rates g1 and g2 . The dynamical path, however, does depend\non these parameters. For example, for \u01eb1 < 0 < \u01eb2 and g1 > g2 (the situation of\nparticular interest to us here), c1 (t) initially increases, but eventually falls off as the\ntotal population density rises settling at (c1 , c2 ) = (0, 1), see figure 4. This behavior\nhas important implications for the competition at the frontier of a colony expanding\nin space, where the concentration of cells is always low. We show in Sec. 3 that the\noutcome of a spatial competition experiment is determined primarily by the exponential\ngrowth rates g1 and g2 rather than \u01eb1 and \u01eb2 , in contrast to the aforementioned behavior\nin a well-mixed population.\n\n\fSelective sweeps in growing microbial colonies\n\n9\n\n3. Competition and migration\nIn this section, the competition model formulated in Sec. 2 is generalized to spatially\nextended environments. To this end, we need a model of cell migration. In general, cell\nmigration is a complicated process, which could involve chemotaxisk, swarming, and\nrandom wandering. Although all of these can be important biologically, some can be\nneglected in appropriately designed spatial competition experiments. For example, cells\nof Baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, often used in microbiological experiments,\nare nonmotile, and many bacterial cells, e.g. Escherichia coli, can be prevented from\nswimming by eliminating functioning flagella or using a high concentration of the\ngelation agent in the growth medium.\nFor nonmotile microbes, the only mechanism of cell migration is cells' pushing on\neach other as they increase in size before cell division. Even a cell division of an isolated\ncell leads to migration because at least one of the offspring is generally displaced in\na random direction relative to the position of its parent. At the colony front, where\ncells are relatively free to move, cell migration can be approximated by a random-walktype process caused by growing cells pushing each other in random directions. The\ndiffusion constant of such random walks must depend on the local concentration of cells\nbecause sector boundaries in the interior of a colony like the ones shown in figure 1\ndo not change with time [15]. For a concentration-independent diffusion constant,\nthe boundaries would slowly disappear as cells of different colours gradually mix [24];\ntherefore, migration must be arrested at high cell concentrations. A possible mechanism\nof this arrest is a significant reduction in growth rate due to nutrient depletion. At the\nedge of the colony, however, the cell density is low, and cells move readily due to the\njostling caused by cell growth, as is evident from the wandering of the sector boundaries.\nSince the exact dependence of the spatial diffusion constant on the local cell\nconcentration is unknown, we have explored a family of functional forms, namely\nD1 (c1 , c2 ) = D01 (1 \u2212 c1 \u2212 c2 )\u03b11 for c1 + c2 < 1,\nD1 (c1 , c2 ) = 0 for c1 + c2 > 1,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere D01 is the diffusion constant of the first strain in the limit of small local\ncell concentration, and \u03b11 is an adjustable parameter that allows us to explore the\nsensitivity to rapid variations in the rate of migration near the frontier. Here, c1 (t, x)\nand c2 (t, x) are cell densities per unit area, rescaled as in Sec. 2. An analogous\ndependence, D2 (c1 , c2 ) = D02 (1\u2212c1 \u2212c2 )\u03b12 \u03b8(1\u2212c1 \u2212c2 ), is assumed for the second strain;\nhere \u03b8(x) is the Heaviside step function, \u03b8(x) = 1, x \u2265 0, and \u03b8(x) = 0 otherwise. The\nchoice of a monotonic dependence of the diffusion constants on cell density is motivated\nby the monotonically decreasing supply of nutrients from the outside to the inside of\nthe colony. To check whether a non-monotonic dependence would affect our results, we\nalso explored D1 (c1 , c2 ) = D2 (c1 , c2 ) = D0 (c1 + c2 )(1 \u2212 c1 \u2212 c2 )\u03b8(1 \u2212 c1 \u2212 c2 ). Although\nk Chemotaxis is an ability of cells to direct their motion in response to a chemical signal, e.g. food or\ntoxins.\n\n\fSelective sweeps in growing microbial colonies\n\n(a)\n\n10\n\n(b)\nFigure 5. (Colour online) Both (a) and (b) show the solution of equation (4) plotted\nfor g1 = 11.8, g2 = 10, \u01eb1 = \u01eb2 = 0, \u03b11 = \u03b12 = 1, D01 = 1.18 * 10\u22123 and D02 = 10\u22123 ;\nnote that we chose g1 /g2 = D01 /D02 = 1.18 to facilitate comparison with figure 1b (see\ndiscussion in text). In these units, the habitat is a 1\u00d72 rectangle and is initially empty;\nonly the bottom sixty percent of the habitat is shown because the top part remains\nempty throughout the expansion. The origin of the expansion is a line at the bottom\nedge of the images, where we impose the boundary conditions that c2 (t, x, 0) = 1\nand c1 (t, x, 0) = 0 except in the width 2\u22128 region near the center of this boundary,\nwhere c2 (t, x, 0) = 0 and c1 (t, x, 0) = 1. No-flux boundary conditions are imposed along\nall other edges. Equation (4) is solved on a square grid of 256 \u00d7 512 points. (a) The\nconcentration of the first strain is shown in red (dark gray) and of the second strain in\ngreen (light gray). The maximal colour intensity corresponds to the concentration of 1,\nand the lowest to the concentration of 0. This colour scheme is chosen to facilitate the\ncomparison with the experimental data shown in figure 1. (b) The same solution as in\n(a), but only the concentration of the first strain is shown to highlight its establishment\nas a sector early in the expansion. Brighter regions correspond to higher concentration\nof the first (red) strain.\n\nthe speed of population waves is different in this model, the shape of spatial patterns\nand their connection to relative fitness remain the same; see supplementary information\n(section S4).\nOur model of spatial competition then takes the following form\n\uf8f1\n\u2202c1 (t, x)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n= \u2207 * [D1 (c1 , c2 )\u2207c1 (t, x)] +\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u2202t\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\ng1 c1 (1 \u2212 c1 \u2212 c2 ) + \u01eb1 c1 c2 ,\n(4)\n\uf8f4\n\u2202c2 (t, x)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n= \u2207 * [D2 (c1 , c2 )\u2207c2 (t, x)] +\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u2202t\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\ng2 c2 (1 \u2212 c1 \u2212 c2 ) + \u01eb2 c2 c1 .\n\nThe initial and boundary conditions are chosen to mimic selective sweeps in microbial\ncolonies. For example, in figure 5, only a very small region is initially occupied by the\nadvantageous genotype, which corresponds to the time when a sector begins to appear\nin figure 1b. Our model cannot describe the earlier part of the range expansion when\nnumber fluctuations are important, because equations (4) are deterministic and treat\nthe cell densities as continuous functions. During this early stage, the advantageous\ngenotype becomes extinct stochastically everywhere but a few spatial locations, where\n\n\fSelective sweeps in growing microbial colonies\n\n11\n\nFigure 6. (Colour online) The solution of equation (4) plotted for g1 = 12.5, g2 =\n10, \u01eb1 = \u01eb2 = 0, \u03b11 = \u03b12 = 1, and D01 = D02 = 0.01. The habitat is a 10 \u00d7 10 square\ninoculated with a circular drop of radius 2 shown in gray. We assign c1 and c2 in the\ninitial circular boundary to be either 0 or 1 (in blocks) to mimic the sectoring pattern\nproduced by a short period of genetic drift with a relatively small selective advantage.\nNo-flux boundary conditions are imposed along all edges. Equation (4) is solved on a\nsquare grid of 2560 \u00d7 2560 points. The concentration of the first strain is shown in red\nand of the second strain in green. The maximal intensity (of red or green) corresponds\nto the concentration of 1, and the lowest to the concentration of 0.\n\nit gives rise to small sectors. These sectors can then be used as the initial condition\nin our deterministic model. We solve equations (4) numerically; see the supplementary\ninformation (section S1) and figures 5 and 6. Note that our model of range expansions\nhas two spatial dimensions, while, in experiments, colonies also gradually thicken in the\ndirection perpendicular to the plate [32]. We neglect this gradual thickening here.\nFrom figures 1b and 5, one can see that there are at least two stages in the sector\nformation. During the late stage, the two sector boundaries are far apart, and the\ninterior of the sector is dominated by the advantageous strain. At this stage, the sector\nboundaries maintain a constant angle with the direction of the expansion, which we\nexplain in Sec. 4 using a very general geometric argument. During the early stage, the\nsize of the sector is comparable to the width of sector boundaries, and the two boundaries\ninteract. By neglecting the nonlinear terms in equations (4) near the frontier, where c1\nand c2 are small, we can qualitatively understand how the duration of the first stage\ndepends on the relative fitness when the fitness difference is small (see figure 7). In\nthis case, we can neglect the bulging of the sector and assume that the population\nwave front is approximately flat. For simplicity, we also assume D01 = D02 = D0 .\nThe x-axis is taken to be along the front and the y-axis to be perpendicular to the\nfront. For the Fisher equation [33], a steady state is reached in a frame co-moving\n\u221a\nwith the population wave (x\u2032 = x and y \u2032 = y \u2212 2 g2 D0 t) when only the second strain\n2\n2\n(note that the nonlinear\nis present.

Here, we vary g1 while keeping D0 = 10\u22123 and g2 = 10 fixed. For\nsmall fitness differences, we expect y1/2 \u223c (g1 \u2212 g2 )\u22121 from equation (6). The data\nfrom numerical solutions of equation (4) is shown as dots, and the solid line is a fit\nto A/(g1 \u2212 g2 ) + B, where A and B are fitting parameters.\n\nstrain are small, the dynamics of the second strain along the y-axis is approximately\nunchanged. Moreover, since the spatial distribution of the first strain along the yaxis is the same as that of the second strain, a similar equality holds for the first\n2\n1\n. Upon using these two observations and the linearized\nstrain g2 c1 \u2248 \u2212D0 \u2202\u2202yc\u203221 \u2212 v2 \u2202c\n\u2202y \u2032\nversion of equations (4), we find that the dynamics of the first strain near the frontier\nis approximately given by a linear diffusion equation with a source,\n\u2202 2 c1 (t, x\u2032 , y \u2032)\n\u2202c1 (t, x\u2032 , y \u2032)\n= D0\n+ (g1 \u2212 g2 )c1 (t, x\u2032 , y \u2032),\n(5)\n\u2202t\n\u2202x\u20322\nNote that this equation is invariant with respect to translations along y \u2032, so we can\ntreat the frontier as a quasi-one-dimensional population. For c1 (0, x\u2032 , y \u2032) = \u03b4(x\u2032 ),\ncorresponding to a point-like inoculant at the frontier, the solution of equation (5)\nis\n\u20322\n1\n\u2212 x\nc1 (t, x\u2032 ) = \u221a\ne(g1 \u2212g2 )t e 4D0 t .\n(6)\n4\u03c0D0 t\nTherefore, the characteristic time necessary for the first strain to dominate the sector\nscales as (g1 \u2212 g2 )\u22121 . This divergent time scale is indeed observed in the numerical\nsolutions; see figure 7.\nThe dependence of spatial patterns during two-species competition on various\nparameters in equation (4) was investigated in the context of linear expansions. We\nvaried the exponents \u03b11 and \u03b12 by factors of 2, \u03b11 = \u03b12 \u2208 {1/4, 1/2, 1, 2, 4}; the\ndiffusion constants D01 and D02 by factors of 10, D01 = D02 \u2208 {10\u22122 , 10\u22123 , 10\u22124};\nand the growth rates g1 and g2 by factors of 10, g1 \u2208 {1, 10, 102} with g1 /g2 \u2208\n{1, 1.01, 1.05, 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 2}. The competition parameters \u01eb1 and \u01eb2 were independently\nvaried relative to min{g1 , g2}, \u01eb1 , \u01eb2 \u2208 [\u22120.5, 0.5]min{g1 , g2 }. This numeric exploration\n\n\fSelective sweeps in growing microbial colonies\n\n13\n\nhelped us identify important parameter combinations that control the shape of spatial\npatterns. We now turn to the discussion of these results.\nFrom numerical analysis, we made an important observation that the expansion\nvelocity of a strain growing in the absence of the other strain depends only on the\nexponential growth rate and diffusion constant right at the frontier and is given by\np\nv1 = 2 D01 g1 ,\np\n(7)\nv2 = 2 D02 g2 ,\n\nindependent of \u01eb1 , \u01eb2 , \u03b11 , \u03b12 (see supplementary information section S4) and in\nagreement with the classic Fisher-Kolmogorov wave theory [33, 34], which provides\nan exact solution for a simpler model with concentration-independent diffusivity. This\nagreement is not surprising because the speed of a Fisher population wave is determined\nonly by the dynamics at the foot of the wave front [33, 29], and equation (3) ensures that\nthe diffusivity approaches a constant for small c1 , c2 . The intuition behind equation (7)\nis that the wave speed depends both on the growth rate (g1 ) and on the rate of undirected\nmigration (D01 ) that brings cells to unoccupied territories. The detailed shape of\nthe wave front, however, does depend on parameters such as \u03b11 and g1 /D01 (or \u03b12\nand g2 /D02 ). The parameters \u01eb1 and \u01eb2 are irrelevant when only one strain is present\nbecause c1 c2 = 0 in this case.\nEven when both strains are present, the knowledge of expansion velocities v1 and v2\nis sufficient to describe the major (large scale) features of the resulting spatio-genetic\npattern. To see this, note that the behavior of population fronts far from the sector\nboundaries is the same as when only one strain is present because the concentration\nof the other strain vanishes away from the boundaries. We also found that the initial\nposition of the sector boundaries is determined only by v1 and v2 (and independent of \u01eb1\nand \u01eb2 ) because, at the tip of the advancing front, the productpc1 c2 is exponentially\nsmall\np\ncompared to c1 and c2 . On smaller length scales of the order D01 /g1 (or D02 /g2), all\nparameters play a role. In particular, all parameters affect the shape of concentration\nprofiles and the position of sector boundaries during the early stage of sector formation.\nNote that, with nonzero \u01eb1 and \u01eb2 , sector boundaries still move behind the wave\nfront even though the diffusivity is zero. To understand this motion, consider strains\nwith g1 > g2 and \u01eb1 < 0 < \u01eb2 . The first strain expands faster, but, after the front has\npassed, the dynamics under crowded conditions, discussed in Sec. 2, favors the second\nstrain. As a result, any region with a nonzero concentration of the second strain is\neventually colonized by it. This behind-the-front competition should lead to a finite\ndisplacement of the boundary because every sector boundary has a finite width due to\nthe discreteness of the number of organisms; see figure 8. Since, for many microbial\nstrains, the boundary width is small, and g1 , g2 \u226b |\u01eb1 |, |\u01eb2|, we do not expect to observe\nthis type of sector boundary displacement (very different from a Fisher genetic wave)\nexperimentally.\nWhat is the relation between v1 /v2 and relative fitness in liquid cultures? In wellmixed populations, selective advantage is often defined from the ratio of exponential\n\n\fSelective sweeps in growing microbial colonies\n\n14\n\nFigure 8. Schematic illustration of transverse boundary motion behind a front\nadvancing in the y-direction for g1 > g2 and \u01eb1 < 0 < \u01eb2 .

There is an\noverlap region, where both c1 (x) (dashed line) and c2 (x) (solid line) are nonzero. This\nregion has a finite width (from A to B) because the discreetness of the number of cells\nis inconsistent with infinitesimally small values of the concentrations. (See Ref. [35]\nfor a more detailed discussion of this issue in a related model.) (b) The concentration\nprofile at the same spatial location as in (a), but after a very long time. The interval\nbetween A and B is now occupied exclusively by the cells of the second strain, which\nwins out under crowded conditions.\n\ngrowth rates, swm = g1 /g2 \u2212 1. At expanding frontiers, we define s = v1 /v2 \u2212 1 by\nanalogy. There may not be a direct correspondence between s and swm because the\nformer involves diffusion constants D01 and D02 in addition to the growth rates g1\nand g2 . For example, a mutation providing a means of motility could be beneficial in a\nPetri dish (due to faster spreading) and deleterious in liquid (due to its metabolic cost).\nHowever, two special cases D01 = D02 and D01 \u223c g1 (with D02 \u223c g2 ) are of interest.\nEqual diffusion constants should be a good approximation for mutations that affect\ngrowth rate, but do not affect motility directly, which is possible when motility does not\ndepend on the growth rate strongly. Growth independent motility was, e.g., observed\nin swimming Bacillus subtilis cells [11]. Under these assumptions, 1 + swm = (1 + s)2 ,\nand swm = 2s for s \u226a 1; see equation (7). The other possibility D0i \u223c gi could be\na good approximation when motility and growth are strongly linked. For example,\ncolonies of S. cerevisiae studied here expand due to cell growth, and it is reasonable to\nassume that D0i \u223c gi a2 , where a is the average cell size. In this case, swm = s, as follows\nfrom equation (7); see figure 9.\nOur simple definition of s (s = v1 /v2 \u22121) has three advantages: expansion velocities\ncan be easily measured, larger expansion velocity results in greater colonized territory\n\n\fSelective sweeps in growing microbial colonies\n\n15\n\nFigure 9. (Colour online) The comparison between selective advantage in liquid\nculture and on Petri dishes within the reaction-diffusion model. The red circles show\nthe results of the numerical solution of equation (4) for single strain expansions. The\nblack line shows the theoretically predicted linear dependence. We varied g1 to mimic\ndifferent growth rates in the experiments and used g2 = 10, \u01eb1 = \u01eb2 = 0, \u03b11 = \u03b12 =\n1, D01 = 10\u22124 g1 , and D02 = 10\u22123 . In these units, the habitat was a 1 \u00d7 10 rectangle\nand was initially empty. Each expansion was started at the shorter edge of the habitat,\nwhere we imposed the Dirichlet boundary condition forcing strain density to be 1. Noflux (Neumann) boundary conditions were imposed along all other edges. The grid\nsize used was 128 \u00d7 1280 points.\n\nand, therefore, greater access to nutrients, and the ratio v1 /v2 is closely related to the\ntraditional definition of swm obtained from the exponential phase of well-mixed cultures.\nIn summary, the main conclusion of the mechanistic modeling embodied by\nequation (4) is that the essential features of spatio-genetic patterns formed during range\nexpansion are insensitive to the details of the model and are determined by a single\ndimensionless parameter v1 /v2 (the ratio of expansion velocities). We further support\nthis conclusion in the next section by deriving the shapes of the spatial pattern without\nrelying on the microscopic dynamics of growth and migration. Additional tests of the\nrobustness of our reaction-diffusion model to changes in the modeling assumptions (such\nas varying the form of the concentration-dependent diffusion constants) are presented\nin section S4 of the supplementary materials.\n4. Sector shapes and the equal-time argument\nIn this section, we develop an analytic argument to understand selective sweeps and\nexplore different ways of measuring relative fitness from macroscopic competition\nexperiments. This argument relies on two assumptions: the strains expand with constant\nvelocities and a patch occupied by one strain is impenetrable to the other strain. We\nprimarily focus on two experimental geometries: linear and circular.\n\n\fSelective sweeps in growing microbial colonies\n\n16\n\nFigure 10. (Colour online) Equal-time argument and sector shape in a linear\ngeometry. The wiggles in the sector boundaries represent genetic drift, neglected in\nmost of this paper.\n\n4.1. Linear inoculations\nUpon establishment, i.e. when sector boundaries are sufficiently far apart, the sectors\nfrom a linear inoculation have a triangular shape. Following Ref. [24], we explain this\nshape by the simple equal-time argument illustrated in figure 10: It should take the\nsame amount of time for the second (less fit) strain to grow along the expansion direction\nas it takes the fitter first strain to grow a longer distance along the boundary. More\ngenerally, for any point along the front, we can define a length \u03c1 that is the length of the\nshortest path connecting this point and the origin of the expansion and lying entirely\nin the territory occupied by the same strain. (This path is a straight line for linear\ninoculations, but curved for radial ones, as we show below.) Then, the ratio of \u03c1 and\nthe appropriate expansion velocity is the time necessary to form this particular spatial\npattern. This time is the age of the colony since inoculation and must be the same for\nall points along the front. From this observation (see figure 10), we conclude that the\nbulging shape of an advantageous sector is an arc of a circle of radius v1 t and angle \u03c6\ngiven by\n\u0012 \u0013 s 2\np\nv1\n\u03c6\n(8)\n\u2212 1 = s(2 + s),\n=\ntan\n2\n2\nv2\nwhich is equivalent to the result obtained in Ref. [24].\nOur arguments are somewhat analogous to the Huygens-Fresnel principle in\noptics [36]. Each point along the front has a potential to create an outgoing circular\npopulation wave that spreads with velocity v1 or v2 , and unoccupied territories are\ncolonized by the strain that gets there first. Unlike in optics, this principle can only\nbe used to construct wave fronts at infinitesimal time steps because, once a region is\ncolonized by one strain, it becomes impenetrable to the other strain.\np The equal-time argument breaks down on length scales smaller than D0 /v1 \u221d\nD0 /g1 because the Fisher velocity will in general depend on the curvature of the\n\n\fSelective sweeps in growing microbial colonies\n\n17\n\nFigure 11. (Colour online) Equal-time argument and sector shape for a circular\ninoculant of radius R0 .\n\nwave front. For example, advancing a circular front requires more time than advancing\na linear front because more cell divisions are necessary to cover the larger area colonized\nby the curved front. The Fisher velocity approaches the limiting value, equation (7),\nprovided the local radius of curvature is much larger than D0 /v1 [29]. D0 /v1 is also the\ncharacteristic width of a sector boundary, where the equal-time argument breaks down\nbecause the strains are intermixed.\n4.2. Circular expansions\nWe now turn to radial range expansions, resulting from moderate-sized circular pioneer\npopulations, e.g., created by placing a drop of the inoculant on the surface of a Petri\ndish. Due to surface tension, small drops (of order 5 \u03bcl to 3 mm in diameter) are\nnaturally circular. A precisely defined initial shape is a significant advantage over linear\ngeometries susceptible to front undulations. This advantage is further strengthened\nbecause a two-dimensional reaction-diffusion population wave started from an irregular\nisland of cells becomes more and more circular as the expansion continues. Even more\nimportant, the interactions of yeast cells lead to an effective surface tension suppressing\nfront undulations [32].\nThe equal-time argument also yields the shape of sectors in the circular geometry;\nsee the schematic plot (figure 11) and numerical solution of equation (4) (figure 6).\nEquating the infinitesimal time increments along the radius of the wild-type colony and\nthe curved sector boundary leads to a differential equation:\np\ndr 2 + (rd\u03c6)2\ndr\n=\n,\n(9)\nv2\nv1\nformulated in polar coordinates (r, \u03c6) with the origin at the center of the expansion.\n\n\f18\n\nSelective sweeps in growing microbial colonies\n\nFigure 12. (Colour online) Illustration of the equal-time argument for the shape of\nthe bulge induced by a faster growing strain (strain 1) in the circular geometry; see\nalso figure 11. The central part of the bulge (between C and D) is an arc of a circle\nbounded by two tangents CK and DK (black dashed lines) to the sector boundaries\nat their origin. The rest of the bulge (between F and C, and between D and E) is\ndescribed parametrically by equation (12), where, for any point A on this part of the\nbulge, the parameter \u03c1\u0303 is the distance between the center of the homeland and the\nintersection point B between the closest sector boundary and its tangent AB passing\nthrough A. Equating the total expansion time of the fitter strain, first, along the sector\nboundary KB and, then, along the tangent AB to the expansion time of the other\nstrain along the radius of the green segment immediately yields equation (12).\n\nThe solution reads\ns\n\n\u03c6=\u00b1\n\nv12\n\u2212 1 ln\nv22\n\n\u0012\n\nr\nR0\n\n\u0013\n\np\n= \u00b1 s(2 + s) ln\n\n\u0012\n\nr\nR0\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the different signs corresponds to boundaries turning clockwise and counterclockwise, and R0 is the initial radius of the population. Thus, we can identify sector boundaries in microbiology with the famous logarithmic spiral of Bernoulli, which also describes the Nautilus shell and insect flight patterns [37].\nThe shape of the bulge at the frontier can also be calculated with the equal-time\nargument. The top of the bulge, well away from the sector boundaries, is a circular arc\nof radius v1 t centered on the origin of the sector; the angular length \u03c6b of this region (see\nfigure 12) is given by\n\u0012 \u0013 s 2\nv1\n\u03c6b\n=\n\u2212 1,\n(11)\ntan\n2\nv22\njust as in the linear geometry. Beyond \u03c6b /2, the bulge is closer to the sector origin\nthan v1 t because these points along the bulge cannot be connected to the origin of the\nsector by a straight line without intersecting the territories occupied by the other strain.\nIn this case, the shortest allowed path back to the founding population is a straight line\npassing through a specific point (point B in figure 12) followed by a curved path along\n\n\fSelective sweeps in growing microbial colonies\n\n19\n\nthe sector boundary to the origin of the sector. From figure 12, one can easily see\nthat the straight path is tangent to the sector boundary. Upon invoking the equal-time\nargument (see figure 12), we find that the shape of the bulge beyond \u03c6b /2 is described\nby\ns\n\uf8f1\n2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4x = \u03c1\u0303 sin \u03ba + (R0 + v2 t \u2212 \u03c1\u0303)(sin \u03ba + v1 \u2212 1 cos \u03ba),\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nv22\ns\n(12)\n\uf8f4\n2\n\uf8f4\nv\n\uf8f4\n1\n\uf8f4\n\u2212 1 sin \u03ba),\n\uf8f3y = \u03c1\u0303 cos \u03ba + (R0 + v2 t \u2212 \u03c1\u0303)(cos \u03ba \u2212\nv22\nwhere t = 0 is the time of the inoculation, \u03ba is given by\ns\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u03c1\u0303\nv12\n,\n\u2212 1 ln\n\u03ba=\n2\nv2\nR0\n\n(13)\n\nand \u03c1\u0303 \u2208 (R0 , R0 + v2 t) is a parameter equal to the length of OB in figure 12.\nSince the two sector boundaries turn in opposite directions, they must eventually\nmeet, thus, enclosing the less fit strain within the population of a faster growing strain,\nas shown in figure 13. This enclosure occurs at \u03c6 = \u00b1\u03c0, and, from equation (10), we\ncalculate the distance Rf from the center of the inoculation to the point where the two\nboundaries finally meet,\n!\n!\n\u03c0v2\n\u03c0\nRf = R0 exp p\n,\n(14)\n\u2248 R0 exp p\ns(2 + s)\nv12 \u2212 v22\n\nwhere the last equality follows from our definition of selective advantage v1 = (1 + s)v2 .\nNote that the time tf = Rf /v2 at which the second strain is enclosed by the first strain\nis exponentially large as s \u2192 0. Therefore, for small s, a competitive exclusion requires\na much longer time than (g1 \u2212 g2 )\u22121 = 1/swm predicted by the well-mixed population\nmodels.\nEquation (12) is valid only up to t = Rf /v2 , and, after the enclosure, the shape of\nthe colony is determined by the expansion of the first strain with velocity v1 .\nAnother interesting consequence of the equal-time argument is that the point where\nthe two strains meet at the colony edgepmoves tangentially to the front of the less fit\nv12 \u2212 v22 ; see figures 10 and 11. Indeed, the\nstrain with a constant velocity v\u22a5 =\ndistance l(t) between the two sector boundaries at a linear front increases with time\nas (equation 8)\nl(t) = l(t0 ) + 2v2 (t \u2212 t0 ) sin(\u03c6/2)\nq\n= l(t0 ) + 2 v12 \u2212 v22 (t \u2212 t0 ),\n\n(15)\n\nand the angular size of a sector \u03c6(t) in the circular geometry grows as (equation 10)\np\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2 v12 \u2212 v22\nR(t)\nln\n,\n(16)\n\u03c6(t) = \u03c6(t0 ) +\nv2\nR(t0 )\n\n\fSelective sweeps in growing microbial colonies\n\n20\n\nFigure 13. The enclosure of a slower growing strain (initially in the majority) by\nthe faster growing strain during a competition experiment. The fitter strain is shown\nin gray, and the other strain is shown in black. Four consecutive snapshots of the\nnumerical solution of equation (4) are shown in (a), (b), (c), and (d). The enclosure\nleading to the heart-shape occurs shortly before the snapshot shown in (d).\n\nwhere the factors of 2 are due to boundary motion at both edges of a sector.

One can also show that ~v\u22a5 = ~v1 \u2212 ~v2 and these three vectors\nmake a right triangle (~v\u22a5 \u22a5 ~v2 ); here ~v1 and ~v2 are front velocities at the sector\nboundary. Sectors of deleterious\nstrain also obey equation (17), but with a negative\np\n2\n2\nlateral velocity, v\u22a5 = \u2212 |v1 \u2212 v2 |.\n4.3. Colony collisions\n\nWe conclude this section by considering competition between two strains not initially\nin contact. At the beginning of the experiment, two circular colonies inoculated with\ndifferent strains grow independently each with their own velocity. Eventually, however,\nthe colonies collide; see figure 14. For simplicity, we assume that the initial radius of\nthe colonies is much smaller than the distance l between the colonies. Provided the\nnutrients remain abundant by time t, the colony boundaries are circles with radii v1 t\nand v2 t except for the collision boundary. The shape of the collision boundary follows\nfrom the equal-time argument; see figure 14. Remarkably, this boundary is also a circle,\nwith radius Rb given by\nRb = l\n\n1+s\nv1 v2\n=l\n.\n2\n\u2212 v2 |\ns(2 + s)\n\n|v12\n\n(18)\n\n\fSelective sweeps in growing microbial colonies\n\n21\n\nFigure 14. (Colour online) Schematic picture of a colony collision.\n\nNote that Rb diverges as the selective advantage s \u2192 0. The center of this circle is\nlocated on the line connecting the centers of the colonies, distance x0 away from the\ncenter of the colony established by the first (faster growing) strain. We find\nx0 = l\n\n(1 + s)2\nv12\n,\n=\nl\nv12 \u2212 v22\ns(2 + s)\n\n(19)\n\nwhere positive x0 corresponds to the direction towards the colony with the second strain,\nand negative x0 corresponds to the opposite direction (see figure 14). Similar to the\nselective sweep in the circular geometry, the less fit strain is eventually enclosed by the\nother strain. The time to this enclosure is given by\ntf =\n\nRb + x0 \u2212 l\nl\n=\n,\nv2\nv2 s\n\n(20)\n\nas one can see from figure 14 and equations (18) and (19).\nWe derived sector and colony shapes using the equal-time argument and the results\nare consistent with our microscopic model. Because this argument relies only on the\nassumptions of constant expansion velocities and impenetrability of occupied regions,\nthe equal-time argument applies more generally. As a result, we expect that the\ncompetition outcome is determined only by the ratio of expansion velocities of the\ntwo strains or species for any model consistent with these two assumptions.\n5. Comparison with experiments\nIn the two preceding sections, we described theoretical predictions for the patterns\nof genetic diversity arising from spatial competitions. In section 3, we developed a\ngeneric reaction-diffusion model in order to predict macroscopic spatial patterns from\nmicroscopic parameters like cellular growth rates and effective diffusion constants.\nIn section 4, we then derived analytical formulae for boundaries between regions\noccupied by the competing strains using the equal-time argument. In this section,\nwe experimentally test our theoretical predictions, using the expansion of the budding\nyeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae on agar surfaces as a model system. We also employ the\nanalytical formulae from the equal-time argument, equations (8), (10), (18), and (19),\nas a means to measure relative fitness s of two yeast strains.\n\n\f22\n\n6\n4\n\ninstant. fitness\n\nradius r [mm]\n\nSelective sweeps in growing microbial colonies\n\nv1\nv2 1.2\n\n2\n0\n0\n\ninst. vel. ratio\n\n1.4\n\n50\n\n100\ntime [h]\n\n1\n0\n\n100\n\ntime [h]\ntime\n[h]\n\n200\n\n150\n\n200\n\nFigure 15.

Inset: Instantaneous velocity ratio as function of time.\nThe instantaneous velocities at a specific time are determined from linear fits to the\nradii of the five surrounding time points. The black vertical line indicates the starting\ntime for the fit in the main figure.\n\n5.1. Testing the equal-time argument\nWe first tested the validity of the equal-time argument results of section 4 with a\nparticular pair of S. cerevisiae strains that have a large fitness difference: the wild-type\nand a faster growing mutant, which owes its advantage to the removal of a metabolically\ncostly mating system; see the supplementary information (section S1) for more details.\nThe equal-time argument assumes spatial expansion at a constant velocity. To see\nwhether this assumption was valid in our experimental system, we measured the increase\nof the radius of circular yeast colonies over time, see figure 15. During the first day,\ncolonies barely grow, presumably because it takes time for the populations to reach the\ncarrying capacity in the spatial region of the inoculum. Afterwards, the colony fronts\nexpand at about 20\u03bcm/h. The rate of expansion first slows down gradually over time,\npresumably because of nutrient depletion and drying out of the agar gel. For larger\ntimes, a stationary expansion front has established, and colonies grow at a constant\nexpansion velocity. Since the latter is a pre-requisite for the equal-time argument to\napply, we only consider these later times in our further analysis. A similar behaviour\nwas observed for the expansion of yeast colonies from a linear inoculation (data not\nshown), although the absolute values of the velocities were very different; e.g. for the\nwild-type, we obtained v2 = 14.5 \u00b1 1.9 \u03bcm/h for linear vs. v2 = 25.0 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcm/h for\ncircular expansions. This difference is presumably due to larger colonies and therefore\nmore severe nutrient depletion in linear inoculations.\nWe next tested whether the equal-time argument correctly predicts shapes of\nboundaries between the strains: linear for linear expansions, logarithmic spirals for\n\n\f23\n\nSelective sweeps in growing microbial colonies\n\nx [mm]\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u22121\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\ny [mm]\n\n3\n\nFigure 16.

The smaller red circle shows the inoculum, and the larger red circle\nmarks the colony radius. The scale bar is 1 mm.\n\ncircular expansions, and circular for colliding colonies. This was indeed the case, see\nfigures 16, 17, and 18. Note that in the case of sectors, the equal-time argument applies\nonly at later times. During earlier times, the expansion velocity is not constant, as\ndiscussed above. In addition, during this initial transient, sectors have not yet fully\nestablished, see the discussion in section 3 and in the supplement section S5. Since both\nconstant expansion velocity and fully established domains of each strains are required\nfor the equal-time argument, we fit our theoretical predictions equations (8) and (10)\nto the sector shapes only for later times, finding excellent agreement (r 2 > 0.995).\n\n\fSelective sweeps in growing microbial colonies\n\n24\n\nFigure 18. (Colour online) Fitness estimation from colony collisions. The wildtype (yellow) colony meets the colony of the advantageous sterile mutant (black). The\nred lines are the fits of colony boundaries by circles. The relative fitness of the colonies\ncan be measured from the radius and center of the circle fitted to the interface between\nthe colonies; see equations (18) and (19). The scale bar is 1 mm.\n\n5.2. Measuring relative fitness\nThis agreement allows us to use the analytical results from the equal-time argument in\norder to measure the relative fitness s. From our analysis, the relative fitness can be\nestimated by five different methods, using (i-ii) ratio of expansion velocities v1 and v2\nof isolated colonies in linear and circular geometries, (iii-iv) sector shapes in linear and\ncircular geometries using equations (8) and (10), and (v) the interface shape of colliding\ncircular colonies using equations (18,19). For consistency, we used the same time window\nfor all assays, see the supplementary information (section S1) for details. To provide\na reference, we also measured the relative growth rate during exponential phase in a\nwell-mixed test tube, either in separate or in mixed cultures.\nThe relative fitnesses s obtained from the different fitness assays yield quite similar\nresults, summarized in table 1. Indeed, the measurements are not significantly different\nfrom each other, except for the circular sector result which differs significantly from\nboth the liquid culture competition and the colony collision assays (p < 0.05, see the\nsupplement section S6 for details on the statistical testing procedure). The deviation for\ncircular sectors could be caused by a systematic error in sector analysis. However, a likely\nexplanation of the disagreement between different fitness estimates is some additional\nspatial structure not accounted for in our theory. Indeed, yeast colonies do not only\nexpand on the surface of a Petri dish, but they also thicken over time to a height of\nabout 1 mm, which is neglected in our two-dimensional theory. It is therefore possible\nthat the advantageous mutant grows on top of the wild-type, producing an apparently\nlarger sector and leading to an overestimate of v1 /v2 .\nTable 1 shows that the different fitness assays have standard deviations that vary\nover an order of magnitude, and therefore have very different accuracies. Expansion\nvelocities of isolated single-strain colonies are the most straightforward measurement of\nfitness on a plate. However, they are less accurate than the sector and colony collision\nassays, as reflected by their high standard deviations in table 1 and the fluctuations of\nthe instantaneous velocity ratio in the inset of figure 15.

Comparison of relative fitnesses measured by different methods. Errors are\nstandard deviations (not standard errors of the mean). The number of replicates (N )\nis given in parentheses. Note that the accuracy of different assays varies by about\nan order of magnitude. The large standard deviations for linear expansions are, at\nleast partially, due to front undulations, which make sector boundaries irregular and\nsector angles more variable. Sector and collision measurement have smaller standard\ndeviations compared to direct velocity measurements. We attribute this distinction\nto the fact that both strains experience exactly the same local environment in the\nsector assay, but only approximately the same environment in the velocity assay.\nIn particular, some environmental parameters\u2013like the local dryness of the agar gel\u2013\nare hard to control, and even identically prepared Petri dishes inevitably have slight\ndifferences in these parameters. Such variations affect velocity measurements, where\nthe two strains are grown on two different (but identically prepared) Petri dishes, but\ndo not affect sector measurements, where the strains are grown on the same Petri dish,\nand compete at the same point in space.\n\nthe two competing strains are in exactly the same environment, and inevitable slight\ndifferences in the experimental conditions, such as humidity of the agar, influence both\nstrains equally. This is not true for the isolated colonies of the expansion velocity assays,\nwhich are therefore more variable. Even more important, we found that relative fitnesses\nobtained from experiments on different batches of plates were significantly different when\ndetermined from expansion velocities, but not when determined from sectors or colony\ncollisions; see the supplementary information (section S1). Nevertheless, the ratio of the\nexpansion velocities is similar for linear and circular expansions, see table 1, despite a\nlarge difference in the absolute values of the velocities, as discussed above.\nLinear expansion assays also have large standard deviations. This is probably due\nto undulations of linear fronts [26], clearly visible in figure 1, which distort the sector\nshapes. These undulations are significantly reduced in the circular geometry, leading to\nsmaller standard deviations. It is thus advantageous to determine fitness from circular\nrather than linear expansions.\nFrom this discussion and table 1, it follows that the radial expansion sector and\ncolony collision assays are the most reliable assays to measure relative fitness in a spatial\ncompetition. We therefore only use these two spatial fitness assays in the following.\nWe have so far found agreement between experiments and our equal-time argument\npredictions, but only for one pair of strains with one particular fitness difference.\n\n\fSelective sweeps in growing microbial colonies\n\n26\n\nfitness on plates s\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n0\n\n0.1\n0.2\nfitness in liquid swm\nFigure 19. (Colour online) Comparison of the selective advantage in well-mixed\nliquid culture and in spatial expansions. We varied the relative fitness using the\ndrug cycloheximide for competitions of the cycloheximide-sensitive wild-type with a\ncycloheximide-resistant mutant. The fitness s measured with radial expansion sectors\n(red circles) and colony collisions (green squares) agrees well with the fitness swm from\nthe liquid competition assay, since all points lie close to the diagonal (black line, not a\nfit). The agreement of the spatial fitness s with the liquid fitness swm is predicted by\nour theoretical model when migration is driven by cell growth, see the corresponding\nfigure 9.\n\nTherefore, we performed further experiments over a range of fitness values. To this\npurpose, we competed a strain resistant to with a strain sensitive to cycloheximide (a\ndrug inhibiting translation) for varying cycloheximide concentrations in the medium.\nThe relative fitness of the resistant strain, as e.g., measured with a liquid culture\ncompetition assay, increases linearly with the drug concentration, see supplementary\nfigure S8. For all concentrations tested, radial sectors and colony collision boundaries\ncould be well fitted with logarithmic spirals and circles, respectively, as predicted by\nour theory. More importantly, we were able to compare the fitness advantage in liquid\nculture swm to the fitness advantage on Petri dishes s over a wide range of relative\nfitnesses. We found good agreement between the two spatial assays and the liquid\ncompetition assay, see figure 19.\n5.3. Testing the reaction-diffusion model\nOur reaction-diffusion model predicts an agreement of the spatial and well-mixed relative\nfitness, if migration is driven by cell growth, i.e. D01 \u223c g1 and D02 \u223c g2 , as discussed at\nthe end of section 3. The results shown in figure 19 are therefore a direct confirmation\nof this version of the reaction-diffusion model. In addition, the reaction-diffusion model\npredicts a constant front expansion velocity, given by equation 7, which is indeed\nobserved in our experiments for large times, as shown in figure 15. Furthermore, the\n\n\fSelective sweeps in growing microbial colonies\n\n27\n\nreaction-diffusion model gives rise to the same, experimentally confirmed, macroscopic\nspatial pattern predicted by the equal-time argument, independent of microscopic details\non the cellular length scale. We therefore preformed competition experiments with\nS. cerevisiae strains that have different cell division patterns, as well as with the\nbacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, see supplementary information (section S3). All\nexperiments could be well described by our theory.\nIn summary, there are experimental subtleties that our phenomenological theory\ndoes not take into account, such as the expansion velocity slowdown, yeast colony\nthickness, or possible strain interactions \u00b6. All these effects could contribute to the\nslight differences of the fitness values determined by different methods, see table 1 and\nfigure 19. Nevertheless, our theory describes the shapes of established sectors and colony\ncollisions very accurately. Considering that the methods to determine relative fitness\nare very different, it is remarkable that the obtained fitness values are so similar, in\nparticular results from well-mixed liquid culture and spatial growth on agar surfaces.\n6. Discussion\nNatural selection in well-mixed populations leads to selective sweeps of beneficial\ngenotypes occurring exponentially fast in time. However, in spatially expanding\npopulations, competition results in more complicated temporal and spatial patterns.\nSince both the advantageous and deleterious genotypes can spread into uncolonized\nterritories, their competition can result in sectoring patterns like that shown in figure 6.\nSectoring spatial patterns provide an alternative fitness assay to the commonly used\nassays based on competition in a well-mixed environment of a test tube. This alternative\nfacilitates spatial evolutionary experiments, which might contribute to understanding\nadaptations in different environments.\nThe spatial assay may also be more accurate, provided front undulations, nutrient\ndepletion, variations in agar wetness, and other experimental complications can be\novercome. For small p\nfitness differences,\nin principle acquire sensitivity\np the assay could\n\u221a\n2\n2\nbecause it measures v1 /v2 \u2212 1 = s(2 + s) \u2248 2s instead of v1 /v2 = 1 + s [24].\nFor large fitness differences, higher accuracy could also result from longer observation\ntimes, as the deleterious strain survives longer in spatial settings. A deleterious strain\nis eliminated linearly (linear geometry) or logarithmically (circular geometry) in time,\nunlike in the well-mixed environment, where it is eliminated exponentially fast. More\nimportant, a spatial competition experiment could be superior to a well-mixed one when\nused for screening for beneficial mutations. On a Petri dish, many beneficial mutations\n\u00b6 The mutualistic or antagonistic interaction represented by the terms with \u01eb1 and \u01eb2 in equation (4)\ncould also change the relative fitness in experiments where the strains are in physical contact compared\nto experiments where the strains are grown in isolation. Three dimensional yeast colonies have a\nrelatively large contact angle with the agar surface at the colony edge [32]. Therefore, the effect of such\nhypothetical interactions between the two strains might not be negligible if the density of yeast cells\nat the colony edge is not sufficiently small, as it would be if cell density decayed exponentially at the\nfrontier.\n\n\fSelective sweeps in growing microbial colonies\n\n28\n\ncan be assayed in parallel from expansions started by a small fraction of fluorescentlylabeled mutagenized cells mixed with wild-type cells. In addition, each mutation is\nspatially isolated, and a dense aggregate of cells only a few generations away from the\noriginal mutation could be easily collected for future use.\nOur analysis of competition during range expansions has applications for\nevolutionary dynamics in spatially extended habitats as well. In particular, the\npredictions for one of the most important quantities in evolutionary dynamics, the\nduration of a selective sweep, is substantially different between spatial and nonspatial\nmodels. Deleterious genotypes persist much longer in spatial populations because the\nbeneficial mutations spreading by Fisher waves may have to travel large distances\nneeded, e.g., to engulf the wild-type populations, as in figure 13.\nAcknowledgments\nDRN and AWM acknowledge conversations with P.
