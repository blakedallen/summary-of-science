These first results, although obtained with a total integrated luminosity lower than\nthe total integrated luminosity collected during Run I, are already competitive if not better,\ndue to the increase in the center of mass energy and the improved detector capability.\n1\n\n1.1\n\nIntroduction: Run II collider and detector upgrades and search strategies at\nCDFII\nTeVatron upgrades\n\nThe run I data taking period at the TeVatron ended in February 1996. Since then the collider\nand both the detectors ( CDF and D0) underwent substantial upgrades.\nThe energy of the beams has been increased from 900 GeV to 980 GeV. A new syncrothron (\" main injector\") has been built in a new tunnel. The main injector together with\na debuncher-accumulator-recycler complex allows for faster production of antiprotons and the\npossibility of reusing them after they are rescued in the recycler. In run I the luminosity\nreached 1.5\u00d71031 cm\u22122 sec\u22121 and was obtained with a 6 on 6 proton-antiproton bunches in the\ncollider with an interbunch time of 3.5\u03bcsec. The luminosity ultimately planned for run II is\n3.3\u00d71032 cm\u22122 sec\u22121 and it will be obtained with 36 on 36 proton-antiproton bunches with interbunch time of 396 ns. So far, about 120 pb\u2212 1 of integrated luminosity has been delivered and\nCDF has used between 50 and 90 pb\u2212 1 for its first physics results.\n\n\f1.2\n\nCDF Detector upgrades\n\nMany components of the CDF detector have been replaced or improved with respect to Run\nI1 . Only the central calorimeter, the solenoid and part of the muon system have been retained,\nalthough in general the electronics has been upgraded to cope with the new interaction time.\nGoing from the inside to the outside of the detector, CDF has a new tracking system, composed\nof several silicon detectors ( L00, SVXII and ISL) and a drift chamber. This improved tracking\nsystem allows for particle detection extremely close to the beam pipe ( the inner most silicon\nlayer sits at 2.5 cm from the beam pipe) and extends the coverage in \u03b7 up to 2 ( it was 1.4 in\nRun I). The z coverage has increased to cover the full luminous region. 3-D track reconstruction\nis possible with impact parameter resolution \u03c3phi < 30 \u03bcm and \u03c3z < 60\u03bcm.\nA completely new open cell drift chamber (Central Outer Tracker ) with maximum drift\ntime of 100 ns allows for better stereo capabilities in tracking reconstruction in respect to Run\nI (\u2206pT /pT < 0.001). It also provides dE/dx information.\nBetween the COT and the solenoid a new Time Of Flight detector has been installed. The\nTOF resolution of order 100 ps allows for 2\u03c3 K\u03c0 separation for transverse momentum up to 1.6\nGeV.\nThe calorimeter has been retained from Run I in the central part, while a new scintillator\nbased plug calorimeter is replacing the old gaseus calorimeter in the large \u03b7 region. It extends\nto \u03b7 up to 3.6 and maintains as much as possible the same \u03b7\u03c6 segmentation of the central\ncalorimeter.\nFinally, the muon system has been partially upgraded: the old Run I central muon detectors has been retained but equipped with new readout electronics, while a new extension and\nintermediate muon chambers will guarantee the muon trigger coverage from |\u03b7| = 0.6 to 1.0.\nAll the front end and DAQ electronics have been changed and upgraded. At Level 1(within\n5\u03bcs) a new online processor reconstructing tracks has been implemented (eXtremly Fast Tracker)\nand at Level 2 (within 20 \u03bcs) a Silicon Vertex Trigger (SVT) links the Level 1 tracks ( from\nthe drift chamber) to the silicon hits and reconstructs offline-quality tracks ( with about 40 \u03bcm\nimpact parameter resolution). This is the first time such a device has been installed in a hadron\ncollider detector and CDF relies upon it to collect large samples of hadronic b decays crucial for\nBs0 mixing and CP violation studies. On the other hand the device has been shown to be very\npowerful for high pt physics, where it allows to select samples enriched in heavy flavors already\nat the trigger level, that can subsequently be used in analysis using heavy flavor tagging.\n1.3\n\nSearch Strategies at CDFII\n\nTwo different approaches to search for physics beyond the Standard Model are actively pursued\nin Run II in a complementary fashion: model-based analysis and signature based studies.\nIn the more traditional model-driven approach, one picks a favorite theoretical model and/or\na process, and the best signature is chosen. The selection cuts for acceptances are optimized\nbased on signal MC. The expected background is calculated from data or Monte Carlo and,\nbased on the number of events observed in the data, a discovery is made or the best limit on the\nnew signal is set. In a signature-based approach a specific signature is picked ( i.e. dijets+X)\nand the data sample is defined in terms of known SM processes. A signal region (blind box)\nmight be defined with cuts which are kept as loose as possible and the background predictions\nin the signal region are often extrapolated from control regions. Inconsistencies with the SM\npredictions will provide indication of possible new physics. As the cuts and acceptances are\noften calculated independently from a model, different models can be tested against the data\nsample.\nIn the next sections we will present the first CDF results from both approaches.\n\n\f2\n\nModel based searches\nSearch for Z' and Randall-Sundrum graviton in high mass dileptons\n\n2.1\n\nNeutral gauge bosons in addition to the Standard Model Z are expected in many extension of\nthe Standard Model. These models tipically specify the strenghts of the couplings of the Z' to\nquarks and leptons, but make no prediction for the Z' mass. A search improving the Run I result\nhas been performed in the di-electrons and dimuons channel, as one of the primary observable\neffects would be anomalous dilepton production at large invariant mass via virtual exchange of\nthe Z'.\nAnomalous dilepton production at large mass can also be the result of Randall-Sundrum\ngraviton, which would appear as a resonance of spin 2. Models with extra dimensions have\nbeen recently introduced to solve the hierarchy problem2 . If the extra dimensions are large the\neffective Planck scale MS can be in the TeV range. In the initial Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos,\nDvali (ADD) models, gravity can propagate in large extra dimensions and the effect of gravity\nis enhanced at high energy due to the accessibility of numerous excited states of the graviton\n(called Kaluza Klein modes). In the Randall-Sundrum graviton model3 a 4-dimensional metric\nis multiplied by a warp factor, which is a function of the compactification radius and changes\nexponentially with the additional dimension. Due to the presence of the warp factor, generating\na large hierarchy does not require a large curvature radius or extra dimension. The masses and\ncouplings of each individual Kaluza Klein states to matter are determined by the warp factor.\nThis implies that these Kaluza Klein excitations of the graviton can be separately produced as\nresonances, enhancing the DY cross section at large mass.\nThe Drell Yan spectrum in the ee and \u03bc\u03bc channel has been compared to the SM expectations\nand no excess has been observed. A 95% C.L. upper limit on the cross section as a function of\nZ' and RS graviton mass. The Z' limit is better than the Run I measurement in the ee channel\n( figure 1-4).\nCDF Run II Preliminary\n\n2\n\n\u03c3 .BR(Z' \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc) (pb)\n\n10\n\n\u03c3 \u22c5Br(Z'\u2192 ee) limit (95% C.L.)\n\u03c3 \u22c5Br(Z'\u2192 ee) LO \u00d7 1.3\n(SM coupling assumed)\n\n\u03c3\u22c5Br(Z'\u2192 ee) (pb)\n\n10\n\n650 GeV/c\n\n2\n\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\nCDF Run II Preliminary\n\n2\n\n\u03c3 .BR(Z' \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc) limit (95% C.L.)\n\u03c3 .BR(Z' \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc) (LO \u00d7 1.3)\n(SM couplings assumed)\n\n10\n\n455 GeV/c\n\n2\n\n1\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n200\n\n\u222b\n\nL dt = 72 pb\n\n-1\n\n\u222b Ldt = 72 pb\n\n-1\n\n400\n600\n2\nZ' mass (GeV/c )\n\n800\n\nFigure 1: Cross section limit as function of\nthe Z' mass, in the dielectron channel\n\n2.2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nZ' Mass (GeV/ c\n\n2\n\n)\n\nFigure 2: Cross section limit as function of\nthe Z' mass, in the dimuon channel\n\nSearch for first generation leptoquarks in dielectrons and jets\n\nLeptoquarks are hypothetical color-triplet particles carrying both baryon and lepton quantum\nnumbers and are predicted by many extension of the Standard Model as new bosons coupling\nto a lepton-quark pair4 . Their masses are not predicted. They can be scalar particles (spin\n0) or vector (spin 1) and at high energy hadron colliders they would be produced directly\nin pairs, mainly through gluon fusion or quark antiquarks annihilation. The couplings of the\nleptoquarks to the gauge sector are predicted due to the gauge symmetries, up to eventual\nanomalous coupling in the case of vector leptoquarks, whereas the fermionic couplings are free\nparameters of the models. In most models leptoquarks are expected to couple only to fermions of\nthe same generations because of experimental constraints as non observation of flavor changing\n\n\f10\n\nCDF Run II Preliminary\n\n5\n\n10\n\n\u03c3\u22c5Br(G\u2192ee) limit(95% C.L.)\n\n4\n\n\u03c3\u22c5Br(G\u2192ee) PYTHIA\u00d71.3\n\n10\n\n\u03c3\u22c5Br(G \u2192 ee) (pb)\n\nRandall-Sundrum Model\n\n10\n\n2\n\nk/\n\n2\n\n205 GeV/c\n360 GeV/c\nPl =\n0.1\n\nM\n\n535 GeV/c\n\n2\n\n10\n\nCDF Run II Preliminary\n\n4\n\n\u03c3 .BR(G* \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc) limit (95% C.L.)\n3\n\n\u03c3 .BR(G* \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc) (PYTHIA \u00d7 1.3)\nRandall-Sundrum Model\n\n10\n\n2\n\n1\n\n10\n\n\u03c3 .BR(G* \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc) (pb)\n\n10\n\n2\n\n2\n\n265 GeV/c\n2\n315 GeV/c\n370 GeV/c\n\n10\n\n2\n\n1\n-2\n\n\u222b\n\nL dt = 72 pb\n\n-1\n\nk / M\nPl = 0.05\n5\nk / M\nPl = 0.02\n5\nk / M\nPl = 0.01\n\n10\n10\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n100\n\n200\n300\n400\n500\n2\nGraviton mass (GeV/c )\n\n600\n\nFigure 3: Cross section limit as function of\nthe Randall Sundrum graviton mass, in the\ndielectron channel\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n\u222b Ldt = 72 pb\n\n100\n\n200\n\n-1\n\n300\n\nk/\nM\n\nPl\n\n400\n\n=0\n.01\n\n500\n\nk/M\nPl =\nk/\n0\nk / M MPl = 0 .1\n.0\nPl =\n0.05 7\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nGraviton Mass (GeV/ c\n\n2\n\n)\n\nFigure 4: Cross section limit as function of\nthe Randall Sundrum graviton mass, in the\ndimuon channel\n\np\n\nneutral currents or helicity suppressed decays.

The current CDF result is focusing on the search\nfor first generation scalar leptoquarks, pair produced and decaying both into an electron and a\nquark. The analysis strategy is the following: a reduced data sample is derived from the high\npT inclusive electron trigger sample. The following cuts are applied:\n\u2022 2 electrons with ET > 25 GeV;\n\u2022 2 jets with ET (jet1) > 30 GeV and ET (jet1) > 15 GeV;\n\u2022 Removal of events lying in the Z mass window (76 < Mee < 110 GeV/c2 );\n\u2022 ET (jet1) + ET (jet2) > 85 GeV and ET (e1) + ET (e2) > 85 GeV;\n\u2022 \u03a3((ET (jet1) + ET (jet2))2 + (ET (e1) + ET (e2))2 )) > 200 GeV;\nNo events survive the analysis cuts.\nThe main background to the process is represented by production \u03b3/Z decaying \u2192 ee events\naccompanied by jets due to radiation. The main component of this background is eliminated by\ncuts on Mee around the mass of the Z boson and the \u03a3ET cuts. Another source of background\nis represented by tt\u0304 production where both the W decay into e\u03bd. Backgrounds from bb, Z\u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 ,\nWW are expected to be negligible due to the an electron isolation cut and large electron and\njet transverse energy requirements.\nAs no candidate events were found, a 95% C.L. upper limit on the cross section times a\nfactor \u03b2 2 as a function of m(LQ) has been set, and it is reported in figure 5a . A mass limit is\nset at 230 GeV/c2 , better than the Run I result.\n2.3\n\nSearch for doubly charged Higgs\n\nDoubly-charged Higgs particles are predicted by left-right (LR) symmetric models, and SUSY\nLR models predict low-mass H++ (about 100 GeV/c2 to 1 TeV)5 . These particles decay to\nleptons, and CDF has searched 91 pb\u2212 1 of CDF Run 2 data for evidence of their production.\nThe search has been performed in the same-sign electron mass windows of \u00b110% of a given H++\nmass (about 3 sigma of the detector resolution). The search is sensitive to any doubly-charged\nparticle decaying to dielectrons, whether it is produced singly or in pairs. In the 80-100 GeV/c2\nmass range, the dielectron search has little sensitivity due to the overwhelming background\nfrom Z production. The background occurs when the Z decays to opposite-sign electrons and\none of the electrons radiates a photon, which subsequently converts. When the wrong sign\na\n\n\u03b2 is the branching Br(LQ\u2192eq), assumed to be equal to 1 for this analysis.\n\n\fGraph\n\nCDF Run II Preliminary, 72.0 pb-1\n\ncross section ( pb)\n\nSearch for 1st generation scalar LeptoQuarks\n\nTheoretical Cross Section, Phys.

The Z background has been evaluated using the data in the 80-100 GeV/c2 mass\nrange and the search has been performed in the region above 100 GeV/c2 . The mass region of\n100-130 GeV/c2 is dominated by this background; above this mass, QCD and Z processes are\nexpected to contribute equally to the background\nThe low mass region (<80 GeV/c2 ) has been used as a test of the background prediction,\nwhich is consistent with 0 events observed. In the search region (>100 GeV/c2 ), 0 events are also\nobserved. These results provide a 95% confidence level cross section limit for pair-production\nof doubly-charged particles, which is reported in Figure 6. As the limit cross section sits above\nthe theoretical prediction it is still not possible to set a limit on the H++ mass.\n3\n\nModel based searches\n\n3.1\n\nSearch for charged massive particles ( CHAMPS)\n\nA search has been performed for charged massive particles long lived enough to escape the CDF\ndetector. As these particles are supposed to be highly isolated and slow moving, the high pT\nmuon trigger has been used to select the data sample. Particle with pT > 40 GeV/c are selected\nto insure full tracking efficiency. These particles should also have a long time of flight through\nthe detector and the new TOF system of CDF provides a sensitivity to higher \u03b2\u03b3 than a dE/dx\nmeasurement (which was used in a similar search at other machines). The event t0 is derived\nfrom tracks with pT > 20 GeV/c and it has been tested with electrons coming from W decay.\nCandidate tracks are required to have a high \u2206T OF = T OFtracks \u2212 t0 . In figure 7 the predicted\nnumber of events is compared to the observed number of events in the signal region: \u2206T OF >\n2.5 ns. This point has a background prediction of 2.9 \u00b1 0.7 (stat) \u00b1 3.1 (sys), with 7 events\nobserved.\nSeveral interesting SUSY-based model can be tested for the presence of slowly moving\ncharged particles. In particular, models where SUSY is broken at low scale, as those including\ngauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking, are generally distinguished by the presence of a nearly\nmassless Goldstino as the lightest supersymmetric particle and a stop or a stau as the NLSP.\nThe next-lightest supersymmetric particle(s) (NLSP) decays to its partner and the Goldstino.\nDepending on the supersymmetry breaking scale, these decays can occur promptly or on a scale\ncomparable to or larger than the size of a detector ( as for CHAMPS)6 . The stop case has been\ninvestigated in this analysis and a 95% C.L. limit on the cross section for stop production as a\n\n\f3\n\nCross section (pb)\n\nNumber of tracks\n\n10\n\nCDF Run 2 Preliminary\nObserved\n2\n\n10\n\nPredicted\n\n10\n\n\u222b L dt = 53 pb\n\nCDF Run 2 Preliminary\n\n50\n\n-1\n\n45\n\nProduction cross section (NLO)\n\n40\n\nCross section limit (Stop isolated)\n\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n\n\u222b L dt = 53 pb\n\n-1\n\n1\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n10\n5\n\n1.5\n2\nMininum \u2206TOF (ns)\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nFigure 7: CHAMPS search: predicted\nnumber of events compared to those observed in the data.\n\n0\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\n120\n\n130\n\n140\n\n2\n\nFigure 8: CHAMPS search: cross\nsection limit as function of stop\nmass\n\nfunction of the stop mass has been set.

The run 2 dijet mass spectrum\nbegins at 180 GeV and falls steeply. The highest mass event has a dijet mass of 1364 GeV.\nComparing\nthe spectrum in Run I and Run II it is evidentpthat the run 2 cross section at\np\n(s)=1.96 TeV is everywhere above the run 1 spectrum at (s)=1.80 TeV. The ratio of the\ncross section in Run II to that in Run I compares favorably with a lowest order parton level\ncalculation.\nTo search for new particles the mass spectrum has been fitted with a simple background\nparameterization and a search for mass bumps comparable with the CDF mass resolution has\nbeen performed. The fit, the fractional difference between the data and the fit, and the statistical\nresiduals between the data and the fit, show that there is no significant evidence for a new particle\nsignal. Several 95% CL upper limits on the cross section times branching ratio for narrow dijet\nresonances are set and compared with the predictions for axigluons, flavor universal colorons,\nexcited quarks, Color Octet Technirhos, E6 diquarks, W' and Z'. The limit plot is reported in\nfigure 9. With the first run 2 data CDF excludes:\n\u2022 axigluons or flavor universal colorons for masses between 200 and 1130 GeV.\n\u2022 excited quarks with mass between 200 and 760 GeV.\n\u2022 color octet technirhos between 260 and 640 GeV.\n\u2022 E6 diquarks with mass between 280 and 420 GeV.\n\u2022 W' with mass between 300 and 410 GeV.\nAll these limits are already better than the corresponding Run I limits.\n3.3\n\n150\n\nStop Mass (GeV/c )\n\nSearch for new physics in the involving photons in the final state\n\nAnalysis are under way in CDF with the aim of understanding our datasets in terms of known\nbackground contributions and possible deviation from it as a sign of new physics. Signatures\ninvolving photons are of particular interest to look for deviations from the SM predictions in the\ncontext of GMSB models. CDF is also using photon signatures as a first follow-up and check\nof anomalous events seen in Run I: in figure 10 the diphotons mass spectra is reported using\napproximately 81pb\u22121 of Run II data.\n\n\f2\n\ndN/dM (1/GeV/c )\n\nDiphoton Mass\n2\n\n10\n\nCDF II Preliminary, 84 pb -1\nData, ET(\u03b3 )>13 GeV\nNon-\u03b3 \u03b3 bg + Pythia \u03b3 \u03b3\nPythia \u03b3 \u03b3\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\nFigure 9: 95%CL upper limits on the cross\nsection times branching ratio for narrow dijet resonances and compare them with the\npredictions for axigluons, flavor universal colorons, excited quarks, Color Octet Technirhos, E6 diquarks, W' and Z'.\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80 100 120 140 160 180 200\n2\nMass (GeV/c )\n\nFigure 10: Diphoton mass spectrum\ncompared to Standard Model expectation\n\nSearches for events with one lepton and diphotons have been carried out and the result ( 0\nevents observed) are consistent with SM prediciton.\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nThe CDF experiment is actively taking physics quality data at the upgraded TeVatron collider.\nThe first results on search for physics beyond the Standard Model have been presented. In most\nof the cases they are already competitive if not better than Run I results, due to the increase in\nthe center of mass energy and the improved detector capability.\nReferences\n1.
