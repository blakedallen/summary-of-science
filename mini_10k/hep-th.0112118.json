To prove this it is sufficient\nto decompose the N supersymmetry\u2013extended multiplets into N \u2032 -multiplets. Of course\nN-extended supersymmetry is more restrictive than N \u2032 < N supersymmetry implying\nthat the former will only allow some restricted couplings of the latter. As we are going\nto show, the same argument does not apply to supergravity theories [2]. Indeed, let us\nconsider a standard N-extended supergravity with N gravitini and a given number of\nmatter multiplets: then the N \u2032 -extended supergravity obtained by reduction from the\nmother theory will no longer be standard because a certain number N \u2212 N \u2032 of spin 32\nmultiplets appear in the decomposition. To obtain a standard N \u2032 -extended supergravity\none must truncate out at least the N \u2212N \u2032 spin 32 multiplets and all the non-linear couplings\nthat they generate in the supergravity action.\nHere I will report on the truncation of N = 2 matter-coupled supergravity theory to\nN = 1, showing that the reduction does indeed imply the truncation of part of the matter\ncontent, besides of the second gravitino multiplet. The present discussion is based on\n[2]. A more detailed analysis, with proofs of consistency, and including the truncation of\nN = 8 supergravity down to general N theories can be found in [2] to which I refer also\nfor the notations and conventions and for a complete list of references.\nThe supersymmetry reduction N = 2 \u2192 N = 1 is obtained by truncating the N = 1\nspin 3/2 multiplet containing the second gravitino \u03c8\u03bc2 and the graviphoton.\nLet us write down the supersymmetry transformation laws of the fermions for the\nN = 2 theory, up to 3-fermions terms [3]:\n\u02c6 \u03bc \u01ebA + i g SAB \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd + \u01ebAB T \u2212 \u03b3 \u03bd \u01ebB\n\u03b4 \u03c8A\u03bc = \u2207\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\nAB\n\u03b4 \u03bbIA = i \u2207\u03bc z I \u03b3 \u03bc \u01ebA + G\u2212I\n+ gW IAB \u01ebB\n\u03bc\u03bd \u03b3 \u01ebB \u01eb\n\n\u03b4 \u03b6\u03b1 = i UuB\u03b2 \u2207\u03bc q u \u03b3 \u03bc \u01ebA \u01ebAB C\u03b1\u03b2 + gN\u03b1A \u01ebA\n\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n\n\u02c6 \u03bc \u01ebA = D\u03bc \u01ebA + \u03c9\u0302\nwhere: \u2207\n\u03bc|A \u01ebB + Q\u0302\u03bc \u01ebA , with the SU(2) and U(1) 1-form \"gauged\"\nconnections respectively given by: \u03c9\u0302A B = \u03c9A B + g(\u039b) A\u039b P\u039bx (\u03c3 x )AB ; Q\u0302 = Q + g(\u039b) A\u039b P\u039b0 ,\nB\n\n\f\u03c9A B and Q = \u2212 2i (\u2202I Kdz I \u2212 \u2202\u012a Kdz\u0304 \u012a ) being the SU(2) and U(1) connections of the\n\u2212\nungauged theory.

Note that for the gravitino\nand gaugino fields we have denoted by a lower (upper) dot left-handed (right-handed)\nchirality. For the spinors of the chiral multiplets \u03c7, instead, left-handed (right-handed)\nchirality is encoded via an upper holomorphic (antiholomorphic) world index (\u03c7i , \u03c7\u0131\u0304 ).\nTo perform the truncation we set A=1 and 2 successively, putting \u03c82\u03bc = \u01eb2 = 0, and\nfor the gravitino we get, from equation (1):\n1\n\n\u03b4 \u03c81\u03bc = D\u03bc \u01eb1 \u2212 Q\u0302\u03bc \u01eb1 \u2212 \u03c9\u0302\u03bc|1 \u01eb1 + i g S11 \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd \u03b3 \u03bd \u01eb1\n\n(15)\n\nwhile, for consistency:\n1\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u2212\n\u03b3 \u03bd \u01eb1\n\u03b4 \u03c82\u03bc \u2261 0 = \u2212\u03c9\u0302\u03bc|2 \u01eb1 + i g S21 \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 T\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(16)\n\nComparing (9) with (15), we learn that we must identify \u03c81\u03bc \u2261 \u03c8\u2022\u03bc ; \u01eb1 \u2261 \u01eb\u2022 . Furthermore, g S11 must be identified with the superpotential of the N = 1 theory, that is to\n\n\fthe covariantly holomorphic section L of the N = 1 K\u00e4hler-Hodge manifold. Therefore\nwe have [7] L(q, z, z\u0304) = 2i g(\u039b) P\u039bx (\u03c3 x )11 L\u039b = 2i g(\u039b) (P\u039b1 \u2212 iP\u039b2 ) L\u039b . As it has been shown in\n[2], after consistent reduction of the special-K\u00e4hler manifold MSK and of the quaternionic\n\u03c3-model MQ , L is in fact a covariantly holomorphic function of the K\u00e4hler coordinates\nw s of the reduced manifold MKH \u2282 MQ and of some subset z i \u2208 MR of the scalars z I\nof the N = 2 special-K\u00e4hler manifold MSK .\nFurthermore, for a consistent truncation we must set to zero all the following bosonic\nstructures:\n\u2212\nT\u03bc\u03bd\n=0\n1\n\n(17)\n\n\u03c9\u0302\u03bc|2 = 0\n\n(18)\n\nS21 = 0\n\n(19)\n\nAs it has been proven in [2], equations (17) and (18) are \"orthogonality\" conditions\non the scalar sectors of N = 2 supergravity which imply a reduction of both special\nK\u00e4hler manifold (MSK (nV )) [8],[9], [10], [3] and quaternionic manifold (MQ (nH )), where\nnV and nH are the number of vector multiplets and hypermultiplets respectively, and\nimply therefore a truncation of part of the matter multiplets. We note that similar\northogonality conditions, leading to the same reduction of the matter content of the\ntheory, can be found through a complementary analysis, by looking at the 3-fermions\nterms in the transformation laws, instead of at the bosonic ones [11].\nEquation (17) is satisfied by imposing a suitable constraint on the set of vectors and of\nscalar sections which can be retained in the reduction. Indeed, if we decompose the index\n\u039b labelling the vectors into two disjoint sets \u039b \u21d2 (\u039b, X), \u039b = 1, * * * , n\u2032V = nV \u2212 nC ; X =\n0, 1, * * * , nC , we may satisfy the relation (17) as an \"orthogonality relation\" between the\nsubset \u039b running on the retained vectors and the subset X running on the retained scalar\nsections. That is we set:\nX\nF\u03bc\u03bd\n= 0;\n\nImN\u039b\u03a3 L\u03a3 = T\u039b = 0\n\n(20)\n(21)\n\nWe note that if we delete the electric field strengths F \u2212X we must also delete their\n\u2212\nmagnetic counterpart GX\n= N\u0304XY F \u2212Y + N\u0304X\u03a3 F \u2212\u03a3 = 0 so that we must also impose\nNX\u03a3 = 0. Then, the constraint (21) reduces to ImN\u039b\u03a3 L\u03a3 = 0 which implies\nL\u03a3 = 0\n\n(22)\n\nsince the vector-kinetic matrix ImN\u039b\u03a3 has to be invertible. Note that condition (22)\nimplies a reduction of the N = 2 scalar manifold MSK \u2192 MR , since it says that some\ncoordinate dependent sections on MSK have to be zero in the reduced theory.\nLet us now quote the reduction of the gauginos transformation law. When \u01eb2 = 0 we get,\nup to three fermions terms:\n\u03b4 \u03bbI1 = i \u2207\u03bc z I \u03b3 \u03bc \u01eb1 + W I11 \u01eb1\n\u03bc\u03bd\nI21\n\u03b4 \u03bbI2 = \u2212G\u2212I\n\u01eb1 .\n\u03bc\u03bd \u03b3 \u01eb1 + g W\n\n(23)\n(24)\n\nFrom eqs. (23) and (24) we immediately see that the spinors \u03bbI1 transform into the\nscalars z I (and should therefore belong to N = 1 chiral multiplets) while the spinors\n\u03bbI2 transform into the matter vectors field strengths G\u2212I\n\u03bc\u03bd (and should then be identified\nwith the gauginos of the N = 1 vector multiplets). Let us decompose the world indices\n\n\fI of the N = 2 special-K\u00e4hler \u03c3-model as follows: I \u21d2 (i, \u03b1), with i = 1, * * * , nC ,\n\u03b1 = 1, * * * , n\u2032V = nV \u2212 nC , where nC and n\u2032V are respectively the number of chiral and\nvector multiplets of the reduced N = 1 theory while nV is the number of N = 2 vector\nmultiplets. By an appropriate choice of coordinates, we call z i the coordinates on MR ,\nz \u03b1 the coordinates on the orthogonal complement. Then it is easy to see that the metric\ngI J \u0304 has only components gi\uf6be\u0304 , g\u03b1\u03b2\u0304 , while gi\u1fb1 = 0. Then, if we decompose the gauginos\n\u03bbI2 \u21d2 (\u03bbi2 , \u03bb\u03b12 ), the above truncation implies, by supersymmetry, \u03bbi2 = 0 and, for\nconsistency,\n\u03bc\u03bd\ni21\n\u03b4 \u03bbi2 = \u2212G\u2212i\n\u01eb1 = 0.\n(25)\n\u03bc\u03bd \u03b3 \u01eb1 + g W\nSetting G\u2212i\n\u03bc\u03bd = 0 gives:\n\n \u0304\n\nimplying\n\n\u039b\n\u2212\u03a3\ni\uf6be\u0304\n\u039b\n\u2212\u03a3\niJ\nG\u2212i\n\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212g \u2207J \u0304 L\u0304 ImN\u039b\u03a3 F\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212g \u2207\uf6be\u0304 L\u0304 ImN\u039b\u03a3 F\u03bc\u03bd = 0\n\n(26)\n\n\u2207\uf6be\u0304 L\u0304\u039b = f \u0304\uf6be\u0304\u039b = 0.\n\n(27)\n\n\u2207i \u2207j L\u039b = iCijK g KK\u0304 \u2207K\u0304 L\u0304\u039b = iCijk g kk\u0304 \u2207k\u0304 L\u0304\u039b + iCij\u03b1 g \u03b1\u1fb1 \u2207\u0101 L\u0304\u039b = 0.\n\n(28)\n\nMoreover, W i21 = 0 implies P\u039b\u03073 = 0, k\u039b\u0307i = 0. Note that the integrability condition of\nequation (27) is:\n\nwhere Cijk is the 3-index symmetric tensor appearing in the equations defining the special\ngeometry (see e.g. ref. [12],[3]). Since the first term on the r.h.s. of equation (28) is zero\non MR (equation (27)), equation (28) is satisfied by imposing:\nCij\u03b1 = 0\n\n(29)\n\nso that only the N = 2 special-K\u00e4hler manifolds satisfying the constraint (29) are suitable\nfor reduction.\nLet us now consider the other condition coming from the reduction of the gravitino\ntransformation law, eq. (18). It implies, on the curvature \u03a921 of the SU(2) connection\n\u03c92 1 :\n\u03a921 = \u2212i C\nI \u03b1\u03b2 U1\u03b1 \u2227 U \u03b22 = 0\n(30)\n\nLet us now note that the scalars in N = 1 supergravity must lie in chiral multiplets, and\nspan in general a K\u00e4hler-Hodge manifold. \u0010It is \u0011therefore required that the holonomy\n\u0011 of\n\u0010\nthe quaternionic manifold be reduced: Hol MQ \u2282 SU(2) \u00d7 Sp(2nH ) \u2192 Hol MKH \u2282\nU(1) \u00d7 SU(n). Therefore the SU(2) and the Sp(2nH ) indices have to be decomposed\n \u0307 \u2208 U(1) \u00d7 SU(nH ) \u2282 Sp(2nH ) and the symplectic metric\naccordingly. We set \u03b1 \u2192 (I, I)\nC\nI \u03b1\u03b2 reduces to C\nI I J \u0307 = \u2212 C\nI JI\n \u0307 = \u03b4I J \u0307 . From equation (30) we see that the constraint (18)\n\u0011\n\u0010\n \u0307\n \u0307 \u2217\nfor involution is satisfied iff U 1I \u2227 U 1I = 0 that is if, say, the subset U 2I = U 1I of the\nquaternionic vielbein is set to zero on a submanifold MKH \u2282 MQ .\nWhen this condition is imposed, the submanifold MKH has dimension at most half the\ndimension of the quaternionic manifold and the SU(2) connection is reduced to a U(1)\nconnection, whose curvature on MKH is:\n\u03a93 |MKH = i\u03bbU 1I \u2227 U1I = i\u03bbU 1I \u2227 U 1I\n\n(31)\n\nso that the SU(2)-bundle of the quaternionic manifold is reduced to a U(1)-Hodge bundle\nfor the nH dimensional complex submanifold spanned by the nH complex vielbein U 1I .\nThe truncation corresponds therefore to select a nH -complex dimensional submanifold\n\n\fMKH \u2282 MQ spanned by the vielbein U 1I and to ask that, on the submanifold, the 2nH\nextra degrees of freedom are frozen, that is: U 2I |MKH = (U1I \u0307 )\u2217 |MKH = 0.\nIn order to consistently impose the constraint U 2I = 0, it is necessary to check its\ninvolution:\ni\ni\n \u0307\ndU 2I = (\u03c9 1 + i\u03c9 2 ) \u2227 U 1I + \u03c9 3 \u2227 U 2I \u2212 \u2206IJ \u2227 U 2J \u2212 \u2206IJ \u0307 \u2227 U 2J = 0.\n(32)\n2\n2\nEq. (32) implies that we must set to zero, for a consistent reduction, also the \"offdiagonal\" part of the Sp(2nH ) connection, \u2206IJ \u0307 . This in turn implies a constraint on the\nfour-fold symmetric tensor \u03a9\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 appearing in the symplectic part of the quaternionic\ncurvature [2]:\n\u03a9IJK L\u0307 |MKH = 0.\n(33)\nFinally, let us look at the reduction of the hypermultiplets transformation laws, after\nimposing (18). They become, after putting \u01eb2 = 0:\nUu1I \u03b4 q u = \u03b6\u0304 I \u01eb1 ;\n\n\u03b4 \u03b6I =\n\n \u0307\ni Uu2J\n\n \u0307\n\nUu2I \u03b4 q u = \u2212C\nI I J \u03b6\u0304J \u0307 \u01eb1\n\u03bc 1\n\nu\n\nC\nI I J \u0307 \u2207\u03bc q \u03b3 \u01eb +\n\ngNI1 \u01eb1\n\n(34)\n\u0010\n\n= \u03b4\u03b6\n\n\u0011\nI \u2217\n\n(35)\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n \u0307 \u2217\n\n(36)\n\nJ\nu \u03bc 1\n1\n\u03b4 \u03b6J \u0307 = i Uu2I C\nI JI\n \u0307 \u2207\u03bc q \u03b3 \u01eb + gNJ \u0307 \u01eb1 = \u03b4 \u03b6\n\nEquations (34) show that the fermionic partners of the retained scalars U 1I are the spinors\n\u03b6I , while the partners of the scalars U 2I which have to be dropped out are the spinors \u03b6I \u0307 .\nConsistency of the truncation then imposes that the gauging contribution gNJ1 \u0307 has to be\nzero on the reduced N = 1 theory.\nIn the sequel, we just quote the main results on the gauged theory, which are extensively\ndiscussed in [2]. The truncation N = 2 \u2192 N = 1 implies, on the gauged theory:\n- The D-term of the N = 1-reduced gaugino \u03bb\u039b = \u22122fi\u039b \u03bbi2 is:\n\u0010\n\nD \u039b = \u22122f\u03b1\u039b W \u03b121 = \u22122g(\u039b) (Imf )\u22121\u039b\u03a3 P\u03a33 (w s ) + P\u03a30 (z i )\n\n\u0011\n\n(37)\n\n- The N = 1-reduced superpotential, that is the gravitino mass, is\n\u0011\n\u0010\ni\nL(z, w) = g(X) LX PX1 \u2212 iPX2\n2\n\n(38)\n\nand is a holomorphic function of its coordinates z i and w s .\n- The fermion shifts of the N = 1 chiral spinors \u03c7i = \u03bbi1 coming from the N = 2 gaugini\nare N i \u2261 gW i11 = 2g i\uf6be\u0304 \u2207\uf6be\u0304 L\u0304.\n\u221a\n- The fermion shifts of the N = 1 chiral spinors \u03b6 s = 2P I,s \u03b6I coming from N = 2\n \u0307\nt\nhypermultiplets (P I,s are the scalar vielbein on MKH ) are N s = \u22124g(X) kX\nL\u0304X Ut1I U2sI \u0307 =\n2g ss\u0304\u2207s\u0304 L\u0304. Furthermore, the consistency of the truncation of the second gravitino multiplet\n\u03b4\u03c8\u03bc2 = 0 and of the spinors \u03b6I \u0307 in the hypermultiplets sector for the gauged theory gives\nthe gauging constraints:\n\u0010\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0011\n\n\u03c9\u03021 2 = 0 =\u21d2 g(\u039b) A\u039b P\u039b1 \u2212 iP\u039b2 = 0 \u21d2 g(\u039b) A\u039b P\u039b1 \u2212 iP\u039b2 = 0\nS12 = 0 =\u21d2 g(\u039b) L\u039b P\u039b3 = 0 \u21d2 g(X) LX PX3 = 0\n\u03b4\u03b6I \u0307 = 0 =\u21d2\n\ns \u039b\ng(\u039b) k\u039b\nL\u0304\n\n=0\u21d2\n\ns X\ng(X) kX\nL\u0304\n\n=0\n\n(39)\n(40)\n(41)\n\nIf we call G(2) the gauge group of the N = 2 theory and G(1) \u2286 G(2) the gauge group\nof the corresponding N = 1 theory, then we have that the adjoint representation of G(2)\n\n\fdecomposes as Adj(G(2) ) \u21d2 Adj(G(1) ) + R(G(1) ), where R(G(1) ) denotes some representation of (G(1) ). The gauged vectors of the N = 1 theory are restricted to the subset {A\u039b }\ngenerating Adj(G(1) ) (that is, with the same decomposition of the ungauged theory, we set\n\u039b \u2192 (\u039b, X), with \u039b \u2208 Adj(G(2) and X \u2208 R(G(1) )). The quaternionic Killing vectors of the\nu\ns\ns\u0304\nt\nN = 2 theory then decompose as k\u039b\n\u21d2 {k\u039bs , k\u039bs\u0304 , k\u039bt , kX\n, kX\n, kX\n}. Obviously, we must have\ns\nthat kX = 0 since the Killing vectors of the reduced submanifold have to span the adjoint\nrepresentation of G(1) . Viceversa, the Killing vectors with world index in the orthogonal\nt\nt\ncomplement, k\u039b\n, must obey k\u039bt = 0, while kX\nare in general different from zero. Indeed,\nt\nthe isometries generated by k\u039b would not leave invariant the hypersurface describing the\ns\nsubmanifold MKH \u2282 MQ . Since we have found that kX\n= 0, equation (41) is identically\nsatisfied. Eq.s (39) and (40) are satisfied by requiring: P\u039b1 = P\u039b2 = 0 ; PX3 = 0.\nWe are left with an N = 1 theory coupled to n\u2032V vector multiplets (\u039b = 1, * * * , n\u2032V ) and\nnC + nH chiral multiplets (X = 0, 1, * * * , nC ) with superpotential (38). All the isometries\nof the scalar manifolds are in principle gauged since the D-term of the reduced N = 1\ntheory depends on P\u039b0 (z, z\u0304) + P\u039b3 (w, w\u0304).\n\nReferences\n[1] J.
