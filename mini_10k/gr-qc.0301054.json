This formalism was extended by replacing the tetrad field with a mixed tensor field\nindependent of the metric tensor in order to develop a mechanism of adjustment of the vacuum energy density that takes advantage of Weinberg's no-go theorem. With no anthropic considerations,\nit was shown that the vacuum energy density is bounded and the gravitational and cosmological\nconstants are proportional to a tiny dimensionless parameter determined by the coupling constants\nof the model.\n\n1\n\n\fRecent observations indicate that in the Planck scale the effective cosmological constant\nis 8\u03c0G \u039b \u2248 10\u2212120 . The problem of the cosmological constant is to understand why it is so\nsmall.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] Since any contribution to the energy density in the vacuum acts\nlike a cosmological constant, quantum field theory leads us to expect an enormously larger\nvalue. In the standard model of particle physics, the sum of the zero-point energies of the\nnormal modes of the fields up to a wave number cutoff of 100 GeV makes a contribution\nin excess of fifty-six orders of magnitude. Setting Einstein's cosmological constant to cancel\nthis contribution requires an extreme fine-tuning that appears unnatural. Although several\ntentative solutions have been proposed, the tiny value of the effective cosmological constant\nremains a deep mystery of fundamental physics.\nAn adjustment by spontaneous symmetry-breaking seems the most promising solution,\n\"an idea that has been tried by virtually everyone who has worried about the cosmological\nconstant\".[1] (A long list of references can be found in [9].) Weinberg's no-go theorem\nshould, however, get due attention: a solution for one or more scalar fields does not imply\nthe vanishing of \u039b.[1, 2] From the point of view adopted in this paper, this should be\nconsidered a positive result. After all, the effective cosmological constant accounts for 0.7\nof the present energy density of the universe. So, instead of trying to get rid of \u039b, let us\nassume that it is simply related to the vacuum expectation value of a scalar field, \u039b = \u03b3\u03c62vac .\nIn the tetrad formalism (see below), the Einstein field equation for pure gravity with this\ncosmological constant takes the form Rab\u03bc\u03bd e\u03bdb = \u2212\u03b3\u03c62vac ea\u03bc , with no explicit contribution of\nthe energy density of matter in the vacuum. The simplest way of obtaining this equation\nis by assuming that it is valid in general, but, of course, this assumption conflicts with the\nEinstein field equation including matter. To avoid this inconsistency, we have to introduce\nin the place of the tetrad a mixed tensor field V\u03bca independent of the metric tensor and the\nspin-connection. The adopted Lagrangians describe the simplest model in which this idea\ncan be implemented.\nIn natural units, the cosmological constant has the dimension of [energy]2 and the gravitational constant has the dimension of [energy]\u22122 . As \u039b and 8\u03c0G have reciprocal dimensions,\nit is possible to define a unit of energy such that they have the same numerical value,\n\u039b = tiny number [unit of energy]2 and 8\u03c0G = same tiny number [unit of energy]\u22122 , just\nchoose the unit of energy such that \u039b/8\u03c0G = 1 [unit of energy]4 . What is the physics determining this energy scale and this tiny number? As we shall see below, the energy scale is\n2\n\n\fdetermined by the maximum of the potential energy of the scalar field that spontaneously\nbreaks the symmetry of the vacuum and the tiny number is given by the dimensionless coupling constants of the model. This result is not substantially affected by the energy density\nof matter in the vacuum, whose range of possible values is bounded. In this sense, the\nproposed mechanism of adjustment of the total energy density in the vacuum is a solution\nof the cosmological constant problem.\nAs everyone knows, general relativity can be cast as a gauge theory by introducing a\ntetrad field ea\u03bc with the properties\ng\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7ab ea\u03bc eb\u03bd ,\n\n(1)\n\n\u03b7 ab = g \u03bc\u03bd ea\u03bc eb\u03bd ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b7ab = \u03b7 ab = diag(1, \u22121, \u22121, \u22121). These equations are invariant under local SO(1, 3)\ntransformations of the tetrad, all corresponding to the same space-time metric. The spinconnection \u03c9 ab\u03bc is the gauge potential of this symmetry and the gauge field strength is\nRab\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc \u03c9 ab\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd \u03c9 ab\u03bc + \u03c9 ac\u03bc \u03c9 cb\u03bd \u2212 \u03c9 ac\u03bd \u03c9 cb\u03bc .\n\n(3)\n\nThe Hilbert-Palatini Lagrangian density expressed in terms of the tetrad and the spinconnection is\nLHP = \u2212\n\n1\ne e\u03bc e\u03bd Rab\u03bc\u03bd ,\n16\u03c0G a b\n\n(4)\n\nwhere e = det ea\u03bc , e\u03bca = g \u03bc\u03bd \u03b7ab eb\u03bd , and Rab\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7 bc Rac\u03bc\u03bd . From the corresponding action for\npure gravity with a cosmological constant, the Einstein field equation takes the form[10]\nRab\u03bc\u03bd e\u03bdb = \u2212\u039b ea\u03bc ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03c9 ab\u03bc is the unique torsion-free spin-connection compatible with ea\u03bc .\nWe extend this formalism by introducing in the place of the tetrad a mixed tensor field V\u03bca\nindependent of the metric tensor and the spin-connection. The Hilbert-Palatini Lagrangian\ndensity is replaced with\n\u221a 1\nLR = \u2212 g g \u03bc\u03c1 g \u03bd\u03c3 V\u03bca V\u03bdb Rab\u03c1\u03c3 ,\n2\n\n(6)\n\nwhere g = | det g\u03bc\u03bd | and Rab\u03c1\u03c3 = \u03b7ac Rcb\u03c1\u03c3 . We introduce also a scalar field \u03c6 described by\nthe Lagrangian density\nL\u03c6 =\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03b3\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\ng\ng \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u2202\u03bd \u03c6 \u2212 V (\u03c6) \u2212 g \u03bc\u03bd \u03b7ab V\u03bca V\u03bdb \u03c62 ,\n2\n2\n\u0015\n\n\u0014\n\n3\n\n(7)\n\n\fwhere the potential is V (\u03c6) = \u03bb(\u03c62 \u2212 v 2 )2 and \u03b3, \u03bb and v 2 are positive constants. As a complement, we introduce a matter Lagrangian density LM that includes a possible cosmological\n\nconstant term and, for the sake of simplicity, is independent of \u03c6 and V\u03bca .\n\nThe field V\u03bca is a Lagrange multiplier that introduces a constraint on the metric tensor,\nthe spin-connection and the scalar field. By varying the action with respect to V\u03bca , we obtain\nan eigenvalue equation similar to (5),\ng \u03bd\u03c3 Rab\u03bc\u03c3 V\u03bdb = \u2212\u03b3\u03c62 V\u03bca ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhich has a non-trivial solution if\ndet(g \u03bd\u03c3 Rab\u03bc\u03c3 + \u03b3\u03c62 \u03b4ba \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd ) = 0 .\n\n(9)\n\nTherefore, \u2212\u03b3\u03c62 is an eigenvalue of Rab\u03bc\u03bd (= g \u03bd\u03c3 Rab\u03bc\u03c3 ) and V\u03bca is an eigenvector belonging\nto it.\nAs we shall see below, (8) is an extended Einstein field equation that reduces to (5) in\nthe vacuum. Thus, the effective cosmological constant is related to the vacuum expectation\nvalue of the scalar field by\n\u039b = \u03b3\u03c62vac .\n\n(10)\n\nHowever, the value of \u03c6vac is not \u00b1v as set by the usual mechanism of spontaneous symmetrybreaking, but depends on the energy density of matter in the vacuum. Reciprocally, the\nrange of possible values of this energy density is bounded by the condition that \u03c62vac \u2265 0.\nIn order to show that (8) is a sound extension of the Einstein field equation, it is not\nenough to show that it reduces to (5) in the vacuum, we also have to find out about the\nconnection between the curvature tensor and the energy-momentum tensor.

So far as this\nis a good approximation in the presence of matter, (15) reduces to the Einstein field equation including matter, \"dark matter\" (the scalar field), and \"dark energy\" (the implicit\ncosmological constant).\nBy varying the action with respect to \u03c9 ab\u03bc , we obtain\n\u2202\u03bd\n\n\u0010\u221a\n\n\u0011\n\ng V[a\u03bc Vb]\u03bd \u2212\n\n\u221a\n\ng \u03c9 ca\u03bd V[c\u03bc Vb]\u03bd \u2212\n\n\u221a\n\ng \u03c9 cb\u03bd V[a\u03bc Vc]\u03bd = 0 ,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere V[a\u03bc Vb]\u03bd = Va\u03bc Vb\u03bd \u2212 Vb\u03bc Va\u03bd and Va\u03bc = \u03b7ab g \u03bc\u03bd V\u03bdb . For our present purpose, it is sufficient\nto observe that, when (17) is valid, the solution of this equation is the unique torsion-free\nspin-connection compatible with ea\u03bc .\nLet us now study the scalar field and the vacuum state. First we rewrite (11) in a more\nconvenient form. Contracting it with g \u03bc\u03bd yields\n\u2212 g \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u2202\u03bd \u03c6 + \u03b3 g \u03bc\u03bd \u03b7ab V\u03bca V\u03bdb \u03c62 + 4V (\u03c6) + TM = 0 ,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere TM = g \u03bc\u03bd TM \u03bc\u03bd . Substituting this result back into (11), we get\n\u0014\n\nV (\u03c6) +\n\n1\n1\nTM g\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u2202\u03bd \u03c6 \u2212 \u03b3 \u03b7ab V\u03bca V\u03bdb \u03c62 + TR\u03bc\u03bd + TM \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd TM .\n4\n4\n\u0015\n\n(20)\n\nNow we obtain the equation for the scalar field by varying the action with respect to \u03c6,\n\u221a\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u2202\u03bc ( g g \u2202\u03bd \u03c6) +\n\n\u221a\n\ng\n\n!\n\ndV\n+ \u03b3 g \u03bc\u03bd \u03b7ab V\u03bca V\u03bdb \u03c6 = 0 .\nd\u03c6\n5\n\n(21)\n\n\fMultiplying this equation by \u03c6 and making use of (19) to eliminate V\u03bca , we get\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2202\u03bc ( g g \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bd \u03c62 ) + g 8\u03bbv 2 (\u03c62 \u2212 v 2 ) = g 2 TM .\n\n(22)\n\nWhat we want is to find an equilibrium solution of the field equations in which \u03c6 and\nall matter fields are constant in space-time. For such constant fields, the solution of (22) is\nsimply\n\u03c62vac = v 2 +\n\n1\nTM vac ,\n4\u03bbv 2\n\n(23)\n\nwhich requires that\nTM vac \u2265 \u22124\u03bbv 4 .\n\n(24)\n\nThus, the trace of the energy-momentum tensor of matter in the vacuum cannot be smaller\nthan \u22124\u03bbv 4 . In other words, \u03c6 and TM are driven by spontaneous symmetry-breaking to\ntake vacuum expectation values such that\n\u03bbv 2 \u03c62vac \u2212\n\n1\nTM vac = \u03bbv 4 .\n4\n\n(25)\n\nHowever, particular values cannot be assigned to \u03c6vac and TM vac without fine-tuning.\nIntroducing the composite field\n\u03c7=\n\n1\n(\u03c62 \u2212 \u03c62vac ) ,\n2 |\u03c6vac |\n\n(26)\n\nwe can reexpress (22) as\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2202\u03bc ( gg \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bd \u03c7) + g 8\u03bbv 2 \u03c7 = g\n\n1\n|\u03c6vac |\n\n(TM \u2212 TM vac ) ,\n\n(27)\n\nwhere there is no sign of the \u03c64 and V \u03c6 interactions, the mass of \u03c7 is equal to the mass\n\u221a\nusually acquired by \u03c6 as a result of spontaneous symmetry breaking, m\u03c7 = 8\u03bbv 2 , and the\nsource of the field is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor of matter above the ground\nstate value, even though \u03c6 is not directly coupled with matter.\nLorentz invariance requires that in the vacuum the energy-momentum tensor takes the\nform\nTM \u03bc\u03bd = \u03c1M vac g\u03bc\u03bd .\n\n(28)\n\n\u03c1M vac g\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212\u03b3v 2 \u03b7ab V\u03bca V\u03bdb\n\n(29)\n\nConsequently, (20) reduces to\n\n6\n\n\ffor \u03c6vac 6= 0. This is consistent with the adopted signature of g\u03bc\u03bd only if \u03c1M vac is negative.\nTaking into account (24), we get the important result that the range of possible values of\nthe energy density of matter in the vacuum is restricted to the interval\n\u2212 \u03bbv 4 \u2264 \u03c1M vac \u2264 0 .\n\n(30)\n\nThere would be no equilibrium vacuum state if this inequality were not satisfied.\nIt follows from (1) and (29) that in the vacuum\nV\u03bca\n\n=\n\ns\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c1M vac a\ne .\n\u03b3v 2 \u03bc\n\n(31)\n\nThis coincides with (17) and agrees with the Einstein field equation if\n\u03c1M vac = \u2212\n\n1\n\u03b3v 2 .\n8\u03c0G\n\n(32)\n\nThus, the gravitational constant is determined by the energy density of matter in the vacuum\nfor a fixed value of \u03b3v 2 . It is interesting that G would be infinite if \u03c1M vac vanished. Therefore,\nthe Universe, which has an extravagantly feeble gravity, cannot have a vanishingly small\nenergy density of matter in the vacuum.\nAs \u03c9 ab\u03bc reduces to the usual spin-connection when (31) is valid, (14) takes the form of\nthe Einstein field equation for pure gravity with a cosmological constant,\nR\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212\u039b g\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(33)\n\nwhere R\u03bc\u03bd is the Ricci tensor and \u039b is given by (10). This equation is valid not only in the\nvacuum, it is satisfied also by the exterior gravitational field of any distribution of matter\nand \"dark matter\". In particular, the successful predictions of general relativity in the weak\nfield regime of our solar system are recovered if m\u03c7 is not too small.\nTaking into account (23), (28), and (32), we get\n1 \u03b3\n\u039b=\u03b3 v \u2212\n8\u03c0G \u03bb\n\u0012\n\n2\n\nAt the minimum allowed energy density, \u03c1M vac\n\nmin\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(34)\n\n= \u2212\u03bbv 4 , the gravitational constant also\n\nis minimum, 8\u03c0Gmin = \u03b3/\u03bbv 2 , and the effective cosmological constant is zero. Of course,\n\nthis is fine-tuning. As asserted by Weinberg's no-go theorem, this model does not imply a\nvanishing cosmological constant. What is important is that it does imply a bounded total\nvacuum energy density. In fact, from (30), we get\n\u03b3 \u2264 8\u03c0G\u03bbv 2 = \u03c0Gm2\u03c7 .\n7\n\n(35)\n\n\fThis inequality can be expressed as a restriction on the possible values of the total vacuum\nenergy density,\n0\u2264\n\n\u039b\n\u03bbv 4\n\u2264\n.\n8\u03c0G\n4\n\n(36)\n\nTherefore, the natural scale of the vacuum energy density is set by the maximum of the\npotential energy of the scalar field, not by the energy density of matter in the vacuum.\nInequality (35) means that the dimensionless coupling \u03b3 is as feeble as the gravitational\natraction between particles described by the composite field \u03c7. If m\u03c7 is smaller than the\nproton mass,\n\u03b3 \u2264 2 \u00d7 10\u221240 .\n\n(37)\n\nThis is what we mean, quantitatively, when we say that gravity is extravagantly feeble.[11]\nThe fact that \u03b3 is very small is the reason why the cosmological constant is small in\nthe Planck scale, independently of the actual value of the energy density of matter in the\nvacuum. To show that this is a meaningful solution of the cosmological constant problem,\nit is convenient to introduce the parameter\n\u03b1=\u2212\n\n\u03c1M vac\n,\n\u03bbv 4\n\n(38)\n\nwhich according to (30) can take any value in the interval 0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 1. If we choose the unity\n\nof energy such that \u03bbv 4 = 1, \u03b1 is equal to the absolute value of the energy density of matter\nin the vacuum, the gravitational constant is\n8\u03c0G =\n\n1 \u03b3\n\u221a ,\n\u03b1 \u03bb\n\n(39)\n\nand the cosmological constant is\n\u03b3\n\u039b = (1 \u2212 \u03b1) \u221a .\n\u03bb\nHence the total vacuum energy density is given by\n\u039b\n= \u03b1(1 \u2212 \u03b1)\n8\u03c0G\n\n(40)\n\n(41)\n\nand the cosmological constant in the Planck scale is given by\n1 \u2212 \u03b1 \u03b32\n8\u03c0G \u039b =\n.\n\u03b1 \u03bb\n\n(42)\n\nAt \u03b1 = 1/2, the total vacuum energy density is maximum,\n\u0014\n\n\u039b\n8\u03c0G\n\n\u0015\n\n=\nmax\n\n8\n\n1\n,\n4\n\n(43)\n\n\fand the cosmological constant in the Planck scale is\n8\u03c0G \u039b =\n\n\u03b32\n.\n\u03bb\n\n(44)\n\nAstronomical observations indicate that 8\u03c0G \u039b \u2248 10\u2212120 and \u03bbv 4 \u2248 1 meV4 . As there\nare good reasons to believe that neither \u03b1 \u2248 0 (no fine-tuning without the scalar field) nor\n\u03b1 \u2248 1 (no fine-tuning with the scalar field), we are naturally led to assume\n\u03b3\n\u221a \u2248 10\u221260 .\n\u03bb\n\n(45)\n\nAccording to (39) and (40), the gravitational constant is very small for 10\u221260 \u226a \u03b1 \u2264 1 and\nthe effective cosmological constant is very small for all values of \u03b1. No fine-tuning is needed,\nthe energy density of matter can take any value in the interval (30).\nIn conclusion, the properties of the equilibrium vacuum state enforce the cancellation of\nall the large and apparently disparate contributions to the vacuum energy density estimated\nby the quantum field theory, to produce a net value consistent with (30) and (36). No\nanthropic considerations are needed, but the tiny value of (45) remains a deep mystery.\n\n[1] S. Weinberg, Rev. Mod. Phys. 61, 1 (1989).\n[2] S. Weinberg, arXiv:astro-ph/9610044.\n[3] S.E.
