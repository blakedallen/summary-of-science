Received 2011 June 6; in original form 2010 October 12\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWe present an analysis of the B-band and V -band rise-time distributions of nearby\nType Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Drawing mostly from the recently published Lick Observatory Supernova Search sample of SNe Ia (Ganeshalingam et al. 2010), together\nwith other published nearby SNe Ia with data starting at least one week before maximum light, we use a two-stretch template-fitting method to measure the rise and\ndecline of BV light curves. Our analysis of 61 SNe with high-quality light curves indicates that the longer the time between explosion and maximum light (i.e., the rise\ntime), the slower the decline of the light curve after maximum. However, SNe with\nslower post-maximum decline rates have a faster rise than would be expected from a\nsingle-parameter family of light curves, indicating that SN Ia light curves are not a\nsingle-parameter family of varying widths. Comparison of the B-band rise-time distribution for spectroscopically normal SNe Ia to those exhibiting high-velocity spectral\nfeatures indicates that high-velocity (HV) SNe Ia have shorter B-band rise times compared to their spectroscopically normal counterparts. After normalising the B-band\nlight curves to \u2206m15 (B) = 1.1 mag (i.e., correcting the post-maximum decline to\nhave the same shape as our template), we find that spectroscopically normal SNe Ia\nhave a rise time of 18.03 \u00b1 0.24 d, while HV SNe have a faster B-band rise time of\n16.63 \u00b1 0.29 d. Despite differences in the B band, we find that HV and normal SNe Ia\nhave similar rise times in the V band. Furthermore, the initial rise of a SN Ia B-band\nlight curve follows a power law with index 2.20+0.27\n\u22120.19 , consistent with a parabolic rise\nin flux predicted by an expanding fireball toy model. We compare our early-time Bband data to models for the predicted signature of companion interaction arising from\nthe single-degenerate progenitor scenario. There is a substantial degree of degeneracy\nbetween the adopted power-law index of the SN light-curve template, the rise time,\nand the amount of shock emission required to match the data.\nKey words: supernovae: general\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nType Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are believed to be the result\nof a thermonuclear runaway explosion of a C/O white dwarf\n(WD) approaching the Chandrasekhar limit (see Hillebrandt\n& Niemeyer 2000 for a review). Explosive nucleosynthesis\nup to 56 Ni releases \u223c 1051 erg, unbinding the progenitor.\nThe subsequent light curve is powered by injection of energy from the radioactive decay of 56 Ni; the \u03b3 rays degrade\nto longer wavelengths as they diffuse out through the expanding ejecta.\nThe well-established relationship between the lightcurve width and the luminosity at peak brightness allows\nSNe Ia to be \"standardizable candles\" at optical wavelengths\n(Phillips 1993), and possibly almost standard candles in the\n?\n\nE-mail: mganesh@astro.berkeley.edu\n\nc 2011 RAS\n\ninfrared (Krisciunas et al. 2004; Wood-Vasey et al. 2008;\nFolatelli et al. 2010). Application of the width-luminosity\nrelation along with colour information to SNe Ia over cosmological scales has led to the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the Universe (Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter\net al. 1999; see also Astier et al. 2006; Riess et al. 2007;\nWood-Vasey et al. 2007; Kowalski et al. 2008; Hicken et al.\n2009b; Amanullah et al. 2010), indicating either the presence of \"dark energy\" having a negative pressure or a failure\nof general relativity on the largest scales. Recent work has\nalso shown that including spectral flux ratios may also aid\nin reducing Hubble-diagram residuals (Bailey et al. 2009;\nBlondin et al. 2011).\nDespite the successful cosmological application of\nSNe Ia, the SN community lacks a clear understanding of the\nnature of their progenitor systems. Possible scenarios include\na single-degenerate WD paired with a red-giant post-main-\n\n\f2\n\nGaneshalingam, Li, & Filippenko\n\nsequence star undergoing stable mass transfer until MWD\napproaches MCh \u2248 1.4 M (Whelan & Iben 1973; Livio\n2000), a double-degenerate WD merger that reaches or surpasses MCh (Webbink 1984; Iben & Tutukov 1994), or the\nresult of a sub-Chandrasekhar explosion of a WD steadily\nburning helium accreted from a companion (Shen & Bildsten\n2009). Each scenario carries with it tentative observational\nevidence and hardships imposed by unrealised theoretical\npredictions.\nWhile considerable attention has been focused on the\npost-maximum decline of the SN Ia light curve, less has\nbeen paid to the rise of the SN Ia from explosion to maximum brightness. This is due to the dearth of data in the\ndays following the SN explosion and the intrinsic difficulty\nof finding SNe Ia shortly after explosion. The Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS) has been successful at finding SNe in the nearby Universe (redshift z < 0.05) and the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Supernova Survey (Frieman et al. 2008) has found and monitored 391 SNe at moderate redshift (0.03 6 z 6 0.35). Higher redshift searches\nsuch as the SuperNova Legacy Survey (Astier et al. 2006)\nand ESSENCE (Wood-Vasey et al. 2007) benefit from cosmological time dilation, allowing the SN rise to be spread\nout over more days in the observer's frame.\nA first attempt at quantifying SN Ia rise times by\nPskovskii (1984) analysed 54 historical light curves gathered\nfrom photographic plates and visual B magnitude estimates,\nfinding a typical rise of 19\u201320 d. Recent attempts have made\nuse of more reliable data taken with charge-coupled devices\n(CCDs) which are linear in translating photons to counts\nover a large dynamic range. A seminal paper by Riess et al.\n(1999b, hereafter R99) used observations of nearby SNe Ia\nto find a B-band rise time of 19.5 \u00b1 0.2 d for a normal SN Ia\nhaving a decline of 1.1 mag between maximum light and 15 d\nafter maximum in the B band (i.e., \u2206m15 (B) = 1.1 mag;\nPhillips 1993). Studies using data on higher redshift SNe Ia\nhave found a rise time in concordance with that of R99\n(Aldering et al. 2000; Conley et al. 2006), advancing the notion that there is limited, if any, evolution in SN Ia properties\nfrom high to low redshifts. Most recently, (Conley et al. 2006,\nhereafter C06) found a rise of 19.10+0.18\n\u22120.17 (stat) \u00b1 0.2(sys) d\nusing SNLS data.\nIn an analysis of B- and V -band photometry of eight\nnearby SNe Ia with excellent early-time data, Strovink\n(2007, hereafter S07) found tentative evidence for two populations of B-band rise times. After correction for light-curve\ndecline rate, S07 found that three SNe rise in 18.81 \u00b1 0.36 d\nand five SNe rise in 16.64 \u00b1 0.21 d. More recently, Hayden\net al. (2010a, hereafter H10) analysed B- and V -band photometry 105 SNe Ia from the SDSS sample and found that\nSNe Ia come from a rather broad distribution of B-band\nrise times, with evidence indicating that slower declining\nevents (e.g., more luminous SNe) have some of the fastest\nrise times. This result has significant implications for lightcurve fitting techniques that rely on a single-parameter family of light curves and theoretical modeling of SNe Ia. H10\nfind an average B-band rise time of 17.38 \u00b1 0.17 d, a departure from the results of R99 and C06 which H10 trace back\nto differences in fitting methods.\nIn this paper, we analyse available data on nearby\nSNe Ia to measure the rise times, relying heavily on the recently released LOSS sample (Ganeshalingam et al. 2010).\n\nPrevious analyses such as those of S07 and H10 use combined\nresults from both B- and V -band photometry to measure the\nB-band rise time. In this paper, we compare the B-band rise\ntime measured in the B and V bands and find that such a\ncombination may not be appropriate. Instead, we present\nindependent analysis of the B and V bands. Specifically, we\ndefine the rise time in a photometric band as the elapsed\ntime between explosion and maximum light for that particular band. Nearby SNe offer the advantage of being able to\nbe monitored by small-aperture telescopes and benefit from\nnot requiring significant K-corrections, which at early times\nare ill defined because of a lack of available spectra to model\nthe SN spectral energy distribution (SED).\n\n2\n2.1\n\nDATA\nLOSS Light Curves\n\nLOSS is a transient survey utilizing the 0.76-m Katzman\nAutomatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT) at Lick Observatory\n(Li et al. 2000; Filippenko et al. 2001; see also Filippenko, Li,\n& Treffers 2011, in prep.). KAIT is a robotic telescope that\nmonitors a sample of \u223c 15, 000 galaxies in the nearby Universe (z < 0.05) with the goal of finding transients within\ndays of explosion. Fields are imaged every 3\u201310 d and compared automatically to archived template images, and potential new transients are flagged. These are subsequently\nexamined by human image checkers, and the best candidates are reobserved the following night. Candidates that\nare present on two consecutive nights are reported to the\ncommunity using the International Astronomical Union Circulars (IAUCs) and the Central Bureau of Electronic Telegrams (CBETs). Time allotted to our group on the Lick\nObservatory 3-m Shane telescope with the Kast double spectrograph (Miller & Stone 1993) is used to spectroscopically\nidentify and study candidates. Between first light in 1997\nand 2010 September 30 UT, LOSS found over 865 SNe, 382\nof which have been spectroscopically classified as SNe Ia.\nThe statistical power of the LOSS SNe is well demonstrated\nby the series of papers deriving the nearby SN rates (Leaman\net al. 2011; Li et al. 2011a,b).\nIn addition to the SN search, KAIT monitors active\nSNe of all types in broad-band BVRI filters. The first data\nrelease of BVRI light curves for 165 SNe Ia along with details about the reduction procedure have been published\nby Ganeshalingam et al. (2010). In summary, point-spread\nfunction (PSF) fitting photometry is performed on images\nfrom which the host galaxy has been subtracted using templates obtained > 1 yr after explosion. Photometry is transformed to the Landolt system (Landolt 1983, 1992) using\naveraged colour terms determined over many photometric\nnights. Calibrations for each SN field are obtained on photometric nights with an average of 5 calibrations per field.\nThe LOSS light curves represent a homogeneous, wellsampled set of BVRI light curves. The average cadence is\n3\u20134 d between observations, with a typical light curve having\n22 epochs. Of the 165 BVRI light curves in the sample, 70\nhave data starting at least one week before maximum light.\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201317\n\n\fRise Times of Nearby SNe Ia\n2.2\n\nLight Curves from Other Nearby Samples\n\nIn addition to the LOSS sample, here we include data from\nthe following previously published SN Ia samples: the Cal\u00e1nTololo sample (Hamuy et al. 1996), the Center for Astrophysics (CfA) Data Releases 1\u20133 (Riess et al. 1999a; Jha\net al. 2006a; Hicken et al. 2009a), and the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP) dataset (Contreras et al. 2010). In cases\nwhere there are data from multiple samples, we chose the\ndataset with the best-sampled light curve to avoid introducing systematic calibration error. With the exception of\nthe CSP sample, all light curves are in the Landolt photometric system. The CSP light curves are in the natural\nsystem of the Swope telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. Comparing LOSS B-band light curves (in the Landolt\nsystem) with CSP B-band light curves (in the Swope natural system), we find differences of \u223c 0.03 mag which do\nnot appear to be correlated with SN colour. We adopt 0.03\nmag as the systematic uncertainty of the CSP Swope system\nlight curves.\nWe also include individual light curves for SN 1990N\n(Lira et al. 1998), SN 1992A (Altavilla et al. 2004), SN\n1994D (Patat et al. 1996), SN 1998aq (Riess et al. 2005), SN\n1999ee (Stritzinger et al. 2002), SN 2003du (Stanishev et al.\n2007), SN 2007gi (Zhang et al. 2010), and a preliminary reduction of SN 2009ig which was found by LOSS about 15 d\nbefore maximum light. In total, we have BV light curves for\n398 SNe.\n\n3\n\nMETHODS\n\nIn this section we detail the method used to measure the\nrise times of our sample. Most previous measurements of\nthe SN Ia rise time have used a single-stretch fit (see R99,\nC06). These studies \"stretched\" the template light curve\nalong the time axis to determine the stretch value, s, that\nbest fit the data. A light curve narrower than the template\nwould have s < 1, a wider light curve s > 1, and a light\ncurve that matched the template perfectly s = 1. Explicit in\nthis formalism is that a single stretch value applies to both\nthe rising and falling portions of the light curve. Instead,\nwe adopt a two-stretch fitting procedure first introduced by\nH10 to fit our B- and V -band data; we fit each band independently. Here we discuss our implementation of the twostretch fitting routine with a template created mostly from\nLOSS data.\n3.1\n\nThe Two-Stretch Fitting Method\n\nIn our two-stretch fitting routine, pre-maximum and postmaximum data are decoupled, allowing the two portions of\nthe light curve to take on different stretch values to match a\ntemplate. We define sr to be the \"rise stretch\" and sf to be\nthe \"fall stretch.\" The template has sr = sf = 1.00 by construction. The two stretched light-curve portions are joined\nat peak where the first derivative is 0, ensuring a continuous function with a continuous first derivative at maximum\nlight.\nMathematically, the time axis is stretched such that\n( t\u2212t\n0\nt 6 t0\nsr (1+z)\n\u03c4 =\n(1)\nt\u2212t0\nt\n> t0 ,\nsf (1+z)\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201317\n\n3\n\nwhere \u03c4 represents the effective \"stretch-corrected\" restframe epoch, t0 is the time of maximum light, and z is the\nSN redshift.\nSimilar to other implementations of stretch (e.g., Goldhaber et al. 2001), we model each light curve as a function\nof time by\nf (t) = f0 S(\u03c4 ),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere f0 is the peak flux and S is our normalised template\nlight curve. We perform a \u03c72 minimization to the quantity\n\u03c72 =\n\nX (F (ti ) \u2212 f (ti ))2\n,\n2\n2\n\u03c3phot\n+ \u03c3template\ni\n\n(3)\n\nwhere i is an index summed over all observations, F (ti ) are\nindividual flux measurements, \u03c3phot is the photometric uncertainty including systematic error, and \u03c3template is the uncertainty in our template as described in \u00a73.2. Our \u03c72 minimization fits for the values of f0 , t0 , sr , and sf . We restrict\nthe fit to data within \u03c4 < +35 d relative to maximum light,\nafter which SNe enter the nebular phase where the stretch\nparametrisation is no longer applicable (Goldhaber et al.\n2001).\nThe rest-frame rise time of a light curve (i.e., the elapsed\ntime between explosion and maximum light in that band)\nis obtained by multiplying the measured sr by the fiducial\nrise time of the template. Following S07, we define the Bband fall time to be the amount of time required for the Bband light curve to decline by 1.1 mag starting at maximum\nlight in B. We define the fall time for the V band to be the\nrequired time for a V -band light curve to fall by 0.66 mag;\nthe fall time of a light curve is 15 sf d. By construction, both\ntemplates with sf = 1 have a fall time of 15 d.\nThe B-band fall stretch sf is directly related to\n\u2206m15 (B) by the simple, empirical formula\n\u2206m15 (B) \u2248 1.1\u22121.70(sf (B)\u22121.0)+2.30(sf (B)\u22121.0)2 , (4)\nwhich was found by stretching our B-band template and\nreading off the resulting value of \u2206m15 (B) mag. Similarly,\nfor our V -band template, we find\n\u2206m15 (V ) \u2248 0.66 \u2212 0.83(sf (V ) \u2212 1.0) + 0.94(sf (V ) \u2212 1.0)2 .\n(5)\nNote that Equations 4 and 5 are only valid for the LOSS\ntemplates, and that sf (B) = 1 and sf (V ) = 1 respectively\ncorrespond to \u2206m15 (B) = 1.1 mag and \u2206m15 (V ) = 0.66\nmag.\nK-corrections are computed with the spectral series of\nHsiao et al. (2007) which provides the spectral evolution of\na SN Ia with a one-day cadence. Using all available multicolour photometry for a SN, the spectrum for the phase nearest the photometry epoch is warped to match the colours in\nthe observer's frame using a third-order spline with knots\nplaced at the effective wavelength of each available filter.\nK-corrections are computed from the warped spectrum and\nare typically < 0.05 mag.\nFor a single SN, our fitting procedure gives the date of\nmaximum light, maximum flux, rise stretch, and fall stretch\nfor both the B- and V -band light curves. For the purpose\nof comparing our results to those of H10, we compute the\nB-band rise time (i.e., the time between explosion and maximum light in B) found using both B- and V -band photometry. To determine the B-band rise time using V -band\n\n\f4\n\nGaneshalingam, Li, & Filippenko\n\nphotometry, we measure the V -band rise time (the time between explosion and maximum light in V ) and subtract off\nthe time between maximum light in V and maximum light in\nB. We employ this determination of the B-band rise time using V -band photometry to compare the rise-time behaviour\nof the two bandpasses over the same time period. Consequently, the determination of the B-band rise time using\nthe V band typically has larger uncertainties than using the\nB-band photometry, since we must also include the error\nfrom both the times of B and V maximum. We emphasise\nthat the V -band rise time is defined to be the elapsed time\nbetween explosion and maximum light in the V band.\n\n3.2\n\nTemplate\n\nThe template plays an important role in measuring lightcurve properties. A template which does not reflect the data\nwill lead to fits with systematically incorrect measurements\nof light-curve properties (H10; Aldering et al. 2000). Here\nwe discuss the sample of objects and the method used to\nconstruct our light-curve templates for the B and V band.\nWe construct our templates from a sample of wellobserved \"normal\" SNe Ia. Most of the objects come from\nthe set of SNe Ia observed by LOSS (Ganeshalingam et al.\n2010), but we also include several objects published previously. SNe Ia with excellent light curves but known peculiarities, such as SN 1999ac (Phillips et al. 2006), SN 2000cx (Li\net al. 2001a; Candia et al. 2003), SN 2002cx (Li et al. 2003;\nJha et al. 2006b), SN 2004dt (Leonard et al. 2005; Wang\net al. 2006; Altavilla et al. 2007), SN 2005hk (Phillips et al.\n2007), and SN 2009dc (Yamanaka et al. 2009; Silverman\net al. 2010), are avoided. The underluminous SN 1991bglike objects show distinctly different photometric behaviour\ncompared with the rest of the SN Ia population, so they are\nexcluded from the sample as well. In total, the set includes\n60 objects, many of which are also in the rise-time SN Ia\nsample discussed in \u00a73.4.\nFor the zeroth-order template light curve, we adopt\nthe fiducial \u2206 = 0 (\u2206m15 (B) = 1.1 mag) template from\nthe Multi-colour Light-Curve Shape (MLCS2k2) fitter (Jha\net al. 2007).1 Light-curve data are then fit using a twostretch fitting parametrisation. The parameters being fit via\na \u03c72 minimization technique are the time of maximum light\nt0 , the flux at maximum light f0 , the rise stretch sr , and\nthe fall stretch sf (see \u00a73.1 for details) after correcting the\nlight curves for time dilation using redshifts obtained from\nthe NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database.2 The light-curve\ndata are then normalised using the best-fit parameters to\nhave a peak flux of 1.0 at \u03c4 = 0 and de-stretched, using sr\nand sf , along the time axis to match the template. After\nnormalizing and de-stretching all of our light-curve data to\nmatch the shape of the template, we study the mean residuals between the data and the template.\nWhile we find that even though the \u2206 = 0 templates\ndo a reasonable job in fitting the data, there are still small\nsystematic trends in the fit residuals. For each band, we fit\na smooth curve to the residuals and use it as a correction\n\n1\n\nDownloaded from www.physics.rutgers.edu/\u223csaurabh/mlcs2k2/\non October 7, 2010.\n2 http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/\n\nto the input template. These \"refined\" templates are then\nused to fit the light-curve data from our template sample\nagain and the fit residuals are studied. This process is iterated until convergence is reached - that is, no systematic\ntrend is observed in the fit residuals. Convergence is achieved\nwithin 5 iterations. We restrict this part of the template\ntraining procedure to data where the MLCS2k2 template is\nwell defined, but before the SN enters the nebular phase.\nFor the B band this is within the range \u221210 < \u03c4 < +35 d\nwith respect to maximum light in B. For the V band this is\n\u221211 < \u03c4 < +35 d with respect to maximum light in V .\nTo estimate the uncertainties of our templates, we bin\nthe fit residuals in 3 d intervals and calculate their rootmean square (RMS). Because a particular light-curve fit\ncan have systematic residuals relative to the input template\n(i.e., several data points in one portion of the light curve\nall show negative residuals, while data in another portion\nall show positive residuals), the residuals at different epochs\nare correlated, and the RMS measurements are an overestimate of the true uncertainties. It is difficult to quantify\nhow the residuals are correlated because different light-curve\nfits have different patterns of residuals. We assume that the\nresiduals are equally affected by the correlated errors in all\nportions of the template, and apply a constant scaling factor\nto the RMS measurements so that the overall fit to all of the\ndata has a reduced \u03c72 \u2248 1. These scaled RMS measurements\nare adopted as the uncertainties of our templates.\nSuffering from a dearth of early-time data, we adopted\nan expanding fireball model to describe the SN light curve\nfor \u03c4 < \u221210 d relative to maximum light based on the arguments presented by R99 and employed in most rise-time\nstudies thereafter. After explosion of the progenitor, the SN\nundergoes free, unimpeded expansion such that its radius,\nR, expands proportionally with time, \u03c4 . Approximating the\nSN as a blackbody, the optical luminosity through a broadband filter on the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the SED is given by\nL \u221d R2 T \u221d (v\u03c4 )2 T . Despite recent observations indicating\nthat T may actually change substantially over this period\n(Pastorello et al. 2007; Hayden et al. 2010a), if we assume\nthat changes in v and T are modestly small, then L \u221d \u03c4 2 .\nWrapping our ignorance into a \"nuisance parameter\" \u03b1, we\ncan write the flux in the rise-time region as f = \u03b1(\u03c4 + tr )2 ,\nwhere tr is the rise time of the template.\nTo determine the rise time for our template, we restrict\nour sample to light curves with data starting at \u03c4 6 \u221210 d\nrelative to B-band maximum and at \u03c4 6 \u221211 d for the V\nband. The following approach was adopted.\n\n(i) Create a random realization of the light curves in our\nsample using reported photometry uncertainties for each\ndata point and systematic calibration uncertainties for each\nlight curve in our template section (see \u00a73.3 for details on\nhow this is implemented).\n(ii) Perform the two-stretch fitting routine, restricting the\nfits to data within the range \u221210 < \u03c4 < 35 d for B or\n\u221211 < \u03c4 < 35 d for V . The fit is restricted to this range to\navoid imposing a shape in the region where we will fit for\nthe rise time.\n(iii) Normalise and two-stretch correct the light curves in\nthe sample.\n(iv) Fit a parabola to the ensemble of light-curve points\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201317\n\n\fRise Times of Nearby SNe Ia\nwith \u03c4 6 \u221210 d for B or \u03c4 6 \u221211 d for V with the constraint\nthat the parabola is continuous with the template.\n\n5\n\n0.4\n\n1.0\n\n0.3\n\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201317\n\n0.2\n\nNormalized Flux\n\n0.8\n\n0.1\n0.6\n\n0.0\n\u221218 \u221216 \u221214 \u221212 \u221210\n\n0.4\n0.2\n\nNormalized Residual\n\nThe procedure outlined above was performed 1000\ntimes for the B- and V -band data independently. We find\na best-fit rise time of 17.92 \u00b1 0.19 d for the B band and\n19.12 \u00b1 0.19 d for the V band.\nWe also attempted to find the best rise time for our\ntemplate using the approach outlined by H10, except on a\nfiner grid. We tested templates with different rise times in\nthe range 15 6 tr 6 21 d in 0.1 d increments (as opposed to\nthe 0.5 d increments of H10). For each template, light curves\nwith data starting at least ten days before maximum light\nwere fit using the two-stretch method (see \u00a73.1 for more details). Unlike the previous procedure to determine the rise\ntime, all data at \u03c4 < +35 d are used in the fit. We calculated\nthe \u03c72 statistic for all stretch-corrected data in the region\n\u03c4 6 \u221210 d for each template. We fit a fourth-order polynomial to the curve of reduced \u03c72 as a function of tr . The\nminimum of the polynomial is taken to be the rise time that\nbest fits our data.\nPerforming a Monte Carlo simulation of this procedure\nto draw 500 unique realizations of our dataset, we find a\nbest-fit rise time of 17.11 \u00b1 0.09 d for our B-band template\nand 18.07\u00b10.11 d for our V -band template. These rise times\ndisagree at the 4\u20135\u03c3 level with what we found above. It is\nunclear why these two procedures find such different results\nfor the best-fit rise time for our template. However, when\ncomparing a B-band template with a rise time of 17.11 d\nto the data after they have been two-stretch corrected using\nstretches found with fits restricted to \u221210 < \u03c4 + 35 d, we see\na significant systematic trend for data \u03c4 < \u221213 d. Similar\nresults are found in a V -band comparison with a template\nrise time of 18.07 \u00b1 0.11 d. While the nature of the discrepancy eludes us, we use a B-band rise time of 17.92 \u00b1 0.19 d\nand a V -band rise time of 19.12 \u00b1 0.19 d to avoid introducing any systematic error. As a precaution, we have run\nour analysis using both sets of template rise times and find\nthat while some of the final numbers change, they change\nsystematically (by \u223c 0.50\u20130.75 d) and do not affect any of\nour qualitative results or final conclusions. In \u00a74.5, we discuss using different rise times in the context of searching\nfor signatures of interaction with the companion star in the\nsingle-degenerate scenario.\nWe caution the reader from interpreting the above template rise times as the \"typical\" rise time of a SN Ia or even\nthe rise time of a SN with \u2206m15 (B) = 1.1 mag. The rise\ntime found above should be viewed as the rise time required\nto match the shape of our template light curve in the region\n\u221210 < \u03c4 < 0 d. The rising portion (\u03c4 < 0 d) of our template\nlight curve based on the MLCS2k2 template does not a priori reflect a light curve with a decline \u2206m15 (B) = 1.1 mag.\nThus far, the goal of constructing our template was to find\na light-curve shape that will fit our sample by applying independent stretches to the rising and falling portions of the\nlight curve. To that extent, the actual number associated\nwith the template rise time is meaningless; the significance\nis in the shape of the light curve. For example, we could\nconstruct an equivalent B-band template with a rise time\nof 35.84 d by stretching the rising portion (\u03c4 < 0 d) of\nour 17.92 d template by a factor of 2. Using a template\nwith a rise time of 35.84 d would decrease the measured\n\n0.0\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.4\n\u221220\n\n\u221210\n\n0\n10\n20\n30\nEffective Days Past Maximum\n\n40\n\nFigure 1.

The final rise time for each\nSN found by multiplying the rise stretch by the fiducial rise\ntime of the template will be the same for both templates.\nIn \u00a74.1, we will use the shapes of our template light curves\nto measure the rise and fall of our data sample and we will\naddress the fall stretch-corrected rise time of SNe Ia in our\nsample.\nFigure 1 compares our template light curve to the\nstretch-corrected light-curve data. Residuals to the fit scaled\nby the template flux are plotted in the bottom panel of the\nfigure. The template fits all portions of the light curve, without any systematic trends in the residuals.\n\n3.3\n\nEstimating Uncertainties\n\nTo estimate the uncertainties in our fitting procedure, we\nuse a Monte Carlo procedure including the effects of systematic calibration error from different photometric surveys, the\nuncertainty in rise time of our template, and the statistical\nphotometric error. The prescription for one simulation for\nour Monte Carlo procedure is as follows.\n(i) For each survey, model calibration uncertainties by\nchoosing a random photometric offset, and change all photometry from that survey by that random amount. The random offset is chosen for each survey assuming a Gaussian\ndistribution with a mean offset of 0.0 mag and \u03c3 = 0.03\nmag. SNe from the same survey will have the same photo-\n\n\f6\n\nGaneshalingam, Li, & Filippenko\n\n\u2206 m15(B)\n\n14\nHV\n\n12\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n\u221210\n\n0\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\nNormal\n\n8\n6\n4\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n2\n\n0.0\n\u221220\n\n0\n0.00\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n0.03\nRedshift\n\n10\n20\nDays Past Max\n\n30\n\n40\n\n0.04\n\nFigure 2.

We take the parameter\nuncertainties to be the standard deviation in our 1000 trials\nand keep track of the covariance matrix between fit parameters.\n3.4\n\n1.0\n\n91T/99aa\nNormalized Flux\n\n# of SNe\n\n10\n\nThe Rise-Time Sample\n\nWe restrict our final sample to objects that have \u03c3tr,f 6\n1.5 d in both the B and V bands to ensure that we are using objects where the rise and fall of the light curve are being\nfit well. By the nature of our Monte Carlo procedure, each\nlight curve does not have a single value of \u03c72 associated with\nit. We instead identify SN light curves which have a median\nreduced \u03c72 < 1.5 over the 1000 trials. Fits are visually inspected to identify the poor ones, which are excluded from\nour sample. We also place the somewhat strict requirement\nthat the SN have data starting 7 effective days before maximum (defined by Equation 1) to anchor the measurement of\nsr . We explore the effects of relaxing or tightening these requirements in \u00a74.7 and find that changing the requirements\ndoes not affect our final results.\nObjects similar to the subluminous SN 1991bg (Filippenko et al. 1992b; Leibundgut et al. 1993) were unable to\nbe fit satisfactorily by our fitting routine. This is not surprising given the significant differences in light-curve shape\nand spectral evolution between the SN 1991bg-like SNe Ia\n\nFigure 3. B-band light curves for the SNe used in this analysis. The light curves have been shifted such that they share the\nsame peak flux and t = 0 is the time of maximum light. The light\ncurves are well sampled and start at least one week before maximum light. The SNe are coded by \u2206m15 (B) which measures the\nthe post-maximum decline. The collection of light curves strongly\nsuggests that SNe with slow rise also have a slow decline.\n\nand \"Branch-normal SNe Ia\" (Branch & Tammann 1992).\nIn \u00a74.6 we discuss our attempt to measure the rise times of\nSN 1991bg-like objects. We also exclude SN 2005hk, which\nis of the peculiar SN 2002cx subclass (Li et al. 2003; Jha\net al. 2006b; Phillips et al. 2007).\nOf the initial BV light curves for 398 SNe, 95 have data\nstarting at least 7 effective days before maximum light that\ncould be fit with our two-stretch routine. Of the 95, 63 have\ngood fits with rise and fall times that be can reasonably\nmeasured to within an uncertainty of 1.5 d.\nFor the purposes of analysing the rise time of different spectroscopic subclasses, we further break our sample\ninto three groups: Normal, High Velocity (HV), and SN\n1991T/1999aa-like (Filippenko et al. 1992a; Li et al. 2001b;\nGaravini et al. 2004). For the classification of HV objects,\nwe adopt the criterion of Wang et al. (2009) that the average\nvSi for spectra taken within one week of maximum light is\n& 1.2 \u00d7 104 km s\u22121 . Objects which have vSi 6 104 km s\u22121\n(more typical Si velocities for a normal SN Ia) are classified\nas normal SNe Ia.\nWe also spectroscopically identify SN 1991T/1999aalike objects in our sample. The combination of SN 1991T-like\nand SN 1999aa-like objects is based off of previous studies which note the similar photometric and spectroscopic\nproperties of the two subtypes (Li et al. 2001b; Strolger\net al. 2002). In particular, both exhibit broad light curves\n(\u2206m15 (B)\u2248 0.8\u20130.9 mag) and spectra indicative of higher\nphotospheric temperatures than normal SNe Ia (see Filippenko 1997 for a review of the spectroscopic diversity of\nSNe Ia).\nOur subclass information comes from spectra taken\nwithin one week of maximum light observed as part of the\nBerkeley SuperNova Ia Program (BSNIP; Silverman et al.\n2011, in prep.). Using a modified version of the SuperNova\nIDentification (SNID) code (Blondin & Tonry 2007), we are\nable to classify SN spectra using a cross-correlation algorithm against a spectral database of know subtypes.

Differences are generally small, although\nthere appears to be a small trend in the rise time as a function of\n\u2206m15 (B). We find evidence for a systematic difference between\nthe two measurements.\n\nsification of SN 1991T/1999aa-like objects requires a spectrum within a week of maximum light to avoid confusion\nwith normal SNe Ia (Li et al. 2001b).\nIn instances where a SN in our sample has a classification in Wang et al. (2009), we adopt their subclassifications.\nOtherwise, our subclassifications are based on BSNIP spectra. We are left without subclass identifications for only SNe\n1992bo and 1992bc; hence, these two objects are excluded\nfrom our subsequent analysis. Our final sample consists of 61\nSNe, including 39 normal, 16 HV, and 6 SN 1991T/1999aalike SNe. Figure 2 shows the redshift distribution of our\nsample for each of the three spectroscopic subclassifications.\nWe plot the B-band light curves for the 61 SNe that\npassed our cuts in Figure 3. The SNe are shifted relative to\nthe time of maximum light and normalised to have the same\npeak flux. Qualitatively, objects with slower post-maximum\ndeclines (i.e., smaller \u2206m15 (B)) have slower rise times. In\n\u00a74.1, we explore this relationship in more depth.\nH10 analyse a sample of 41 nearby SNe Ia drawn from\nS07, R99, and the CfA3 sample (Hicken et al. 2009a). Our\nanalysis benefits from the addition of the LOSS SN Ia sample\nwhich has BV data starting at least a week before maximum\nlight for 70 SNe.

The difference is consistent with 0 d.\n\nand V as a function of \u2206m15 (B) using measurements for\n105 SDSS-II SNe Ia.\nIn this paper, we take a different approach and independently measure the B-band and V -band rise times from\nthe corresponding photometric data. However, we can use\nthe results of our fitting routine to look for similar trends\nin the B-band rise time. In \u00a73.5.1, we compare the B-band\nrise time derived from the B band to that derived from the\nV band. The B-band rise time found using the V -band data\nis measured by taking the V -band rise time and subtracting\nthe time between maximum light in the V and B bands.\nComparisons by H10 are done in stretch space, while\nours are between the measured rise/fall time. H10 use a single template rise time of 16.5 d for both the B and V bands\nfor fitting the rise stretch of their data light curves. Going\nfrom rise stretch to rise time only requires multiplying the\nmeasured rise stretch by the rise time of their fiducial template. Our fitting routine measures the rise and fall values\nof stretch using a Monte Carlo simulation which randomly\nchooses a template rise time based on the best-fit template\nrise time and its Gaussian uncertainty (see \u00a73.3 for details).\nThe measured rise-stretch values are tied to the template\nrise time used for the fit, making the rise time a more appropriate quantity to compare.\n\n3.5.1\n\nB-band Rise-Time Comparison\n\nIn Table 1, we show the differences in B-band rise time\nderived using the B band, tr (B)(B), and the V band,\ntr (B)(V ), for our sample divided by spectroscopic subclassification.\nFor our entire sample of 61 SNe, we find a mean difference of \u22120.91 \u00b1 0.10 d (standard error of the mean), in\nthe sense that the B-band rise time is shorter using B-band\nphotometry compared to that derived using V -band photometry.

We find evidence for a systematic difference of \u223c 1 d between the 2 determinations of the\nB-band rise time.\nIn Figure 4 we plot difference in B-band rise time as\na function of \u2206m15 (B). There appears to be a small trend\nin the B-band rise time difference with increasing \u2206m15 (B).\nFitting a line results in a slope of \u22120.54\u00b10.44 d mag\u22121 . The\nslope is computed by bootstrap resampling our sample to\ngive 1000 realizations of our dataset. The mean and standard\ndeviation of the distribution of the fit slopes are adopted as\nthe most probable slope value and 1\u03c3 uncertainty. We do\nnot find evidence of a significant trend.\nOur comparison shows evidence for a slight systematic\ntrend that the rise time is \u223c 1 d longer when measured with\nthe V band. At least part of such a shift can be hidden by\nuncertainties in measuring the time of maximum flux of a\nlight curve where the derivative slowly approaches 0 within\na day of maximum light. Combining the two measurements\nwill introduce systematic errors into an analysis.\n\n3.5.2\n\nTable 2. Mean differences in B- and V -band fall times by spectroscopic subclassification\n\nFall-Time Comparison\n\nIn a comparison of fall-time stretches derived from the B\nand V bands by H10, the authors found that objects with\nsmall \u2206m15 (B) had a larger B-band fall stretch than V band fall stretch (i.e., tf (B) > tf (V )). We look for a similar\ntrend in our data.\nRecall that the B-band fall time is defined as the\namount of time it takes for the B-band light curve to fall\nby 1.1 mag after maximum light in B, and the V -band fall\ntime is defined as the amount of time it takes for the V -band\nlight curve to fall by 0.66 mag after maximum light in V . By\nconstruction, our templates both have a fall time of 15 d.\nIn Table 2 we show the difference in fall times between\nthe B and V bands (i.e., tf (B) \u2212 tf (V )). A comparison of\nthe fall times for all 61 objects gives a mean difference of\n\u22120.21 \u00b1 0.09 d (standard error in the mean) between the B\nand V bands for all objects. There is no significant mean\ndifference in the fall time measured between the B and V\nbands across all subclassifications.\nWe plot the difference in fall times as a function of\n\u2206m15 (B) in Figure 5. The mean fall-time difference is consistent with 0 d. Fitting a line to the data, we measure a\nslope of \u22120.47 \u00b1 0.36 d mag\u22121 , finding no significant evidence for a trend.\n\nSubclassification\n\ntf (B) \u2212 tf (V )\n\nNormal\nHigh Velocity\nSN 1991T/1999aa-like\nAll\n\n\u22120.20 \u00b1 0.08\n\u22120.19 \u00b1 0.22\n\u22120.32 \u00b1 0.39\n\u22120.21 \u00b1 0.09\n\nd\nd\nd\nd\n\nTable 3.

Given the\nresults found in \u00a73.5, we treat the B and V bands separately.\nIn the following analysis, the rise time for a given band is\ndefined as the elapsed time between explosion and maximum\nlight in that band. Note that the results are not corrected\nfor stretch unless indicated by a 0 symbol, in which case the\nquantity is corrected for fall stretch.\n4.1\n\nRise Times Correlated with Decline\n\nIn Figure 6, we plot the rest-frame B-band rise time as a\nfunction of \u2206m15 (B) and the rest-frame V -band rise time as\na function of \u2206m15 (V ) for our nearby sample of 61 objects.\nIn both bands, there is a strong correlation between the\nrise time and the post-maximum decline, although the scatter indicates that the situation is more complicated than a\nsimple one-to-one mapping between light-curve decline and\nthe rise time. In general, SNe with slower post-maximum\ndeclines (e.g., small \u2206m15 (B)/ \u2206m15 (V )) have longer rise\ntimes. This correlation is evident in B, but shows more scatter in V . Using 61 objects, we calculate a Pearson correlation\ncoefficient of \u22120.69 \u00b1 0.03 for B and \u22120.49 \u00b1 0.04 for V . The\nprobability of a Pearson coefficient < \u22120.49 for two uncorrelated variables and 61 measurements is < 0.01%, indicating\na highly significant correlation in both B and V . The correlation remains strong even when excluding SN 1991T/1999aalike objects.\nFigure 6 indicates that SN 1991T/SN 1999aa-like SNe\n(i.e., overluminous SNe Ia) have the longest rise times. In\ncontrast, H10 find that overluminous events have some of\nthe shortest B-band rise times in their sample. However,\nH10 have few overluminous events and spectroscopic identifications were not included in their analysis. Instead, identifications of overluminous objects were based on \u2206m15 (B).\nIn Table 3, we give the fall-stretch corrected rise times,\ntr 0 , for the various spectroscopic subclassifications in our\nsample for the B and V bands.

Note that the rise time is not stretch corrected. Using the two-stretch fitting method, we find a correlation between\n\u2206m15 (B) (calculated from sf (B) and Equation 4) and rise time. SNe with smaller \u2206m15 (B) (i.e., a slower post-maximum decline rate)\nhave longer rise times. SNe that have been identified as HV are plotted as red stars. For fixed \u2206m15 (B), HV SNe appear to have shorter\nrise times than their normal counterparts in the B band. Overluminous SN 1991T/1999aa-like objects are plotted as blue squares. These\nobjects have the smallest values of \u2206m15 (B) and the longest rise times. A less prominent, but similar correlation exists in \u2206m15 (V )\n(calculated from sf (V ) and Equation 5) and the V -band rise time.\n\nobjects is (respectively) 18.03 \u00b1 0.24 d (uncertainty in the\nmean) and 16.63 \u00b1 0.29 d, a \u223c 3\u03c3 difference. H10 found an\naverage B-band rise of 17.38 \u00b1 0.17 d for the SDSS sample,\nconsistent to 2.2\u03c3 with our rise time for normal SNe Ia.\nWhen we correct our V -band rise times to \u2206m15 (V ) =\n0.66 mag by dividing by the V -band fall stretch for normal\nobjects, we find a fall-stretch corrected, rest-frame V -band\nrise time of 20.23 \u00b1 0.44 d (uncertainty in the mean). The\nfall-stretch corrected rise time of HV objects is 19.43\u00b10.33 d,\nconsistent with the V -band rise time of normal objects. If\nwe assume that a normal SN Ia with \u2206m15 (B) = 1.1 mag\ncorresponds to \u2206m15 (V ) = 0.66 mag, then the fall-stretch\ncorrected V -band rise time is 2.20 \u00b1 0.50 d longer than\nthe B-band rise time. This is within 1.5\u03c3 of the 1.5 d\ndifference reported by R99 despite our disagreement on\nthe actual measured B-band and V -band rise times for a\n\u2206m15 (B) = 1.1 mag SN (R99 measure 19.5 \u00b1 0.2 d and\n21 \u00b1 0.2 d for their B- and V -band rise times, respectively).\nFor the HV objects, we measure a fall-stretch corrected risetime difference of 2.80 \u00b1 0.44 d. The larger difference (in\nabsolute terms) in the B- and V -band rise times for HV\nobjects compared to normal objects indicates that HV objects have a faster rise in the B band than in the V band\n(compared to normal objects).\n4.2\n\nThe Rise Time of High Velocity SNe\n\nPlotted as red stars in Figure 6 are objects spectroscopically\nsubclassified as HV, while normal SNe Ia are plotted as filled\ncircles. In the B band, HV objects appear to lie along a locus\nof points below that of normal SNe. For a fixed \u2206m15 (B)\nin the B band, HV objects have a shorter rise than normal\nSNe. Analysing smaller samples, Pignata et al. (2008) and\nZhang et al. (2010) previously found that HV SNe Ia appear\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201317\n\nto have a faster B-band rise for a given \u2206m15 (B). This result\nis not evident in the V band, where HV objects do not differ\nsignificantly from their normal counterparts.\nThe \u223c 3\u03c3 difference in fall-stretch corrected rise time\nbetween HV and normal objects in B and the lack of a\nsignificant difference in V provides evidence for subtle differences in the photometric evolution of these two subclassifications. Recent work by Wang et al. (2009) and Foley\n& Kasen (2011) has shown that the two subclassifications\nhave different Bmax \u2212Vmax pseudocolour3 distributions, with\nHV objects typically having a redder pseudocolour. Furthermore, these studies have shown that separating HV and normal objects in cosmological analyses reduces the scatter in\na Hubble diagram from 0.18 mag to 0.12 mag.\nFoley & Kasen (2011) provide a model which offers\na possible explanation for why HV objects have a redder\nBmax \u2212 Vmax colour at maximum light. The two dominant\nsources of opacity in the atmosphere of a SN are electron\nscattering and line opacity from Fe-group elements. Electron scattering opacity is wavelength independent, while line\nopacity from Fe-group elements is most significant at wavelengths shorter than 4300 \u00c5 (Kasen & Plewa 2007, hereafter\nKP07). The transition from electron scattering to Fe-group\nline opacity occurs near the peak of the B band. SNe with\nhigh-velocity ejecta will have broader Fe-group absorption\nfeatures, which will decrease flux in the B band while having\nlittle effect on V -band flux.\n\n3\n\nNote that Bmax \u2212 Vmax is the B-band magnitude at maximum\nlight in the B band minus the V -band magnitude at maximum\nlight in the V band. The dates of maximum light are typically\noffset by \u223c2 d, making this quantity not an actual observed colour\nof the SN at a discrete time.\n\n\f10\n\nGaneshalingam, Li, & Filippenko\n\nFoley & Kasen (2011) analyse models of an off-centre\nfailed deflagration to detonation from KP07 to explore the\nexpected differences in observables of HV and normal SNe.\nThe KP07 models studied a single SN with an off-centre\nignition viewed from different angles. When viewed on the\nside nearest the ignition, the KP07 models produce a SN\nwith HV features. When viewed from the side opposite the\nignition, we will view a normal SN. Although the models\npresented in KP07 were intended to study the observational\nconsequences of off-centre explosions, their model spectra\nand light curves conveniently produce a similar distribution\nof ejecta velocities to that observed between normal and HV\nSNe depending on viewing angle. The set of models predicts\nthat HV objects should have redder colours at maximum\nlight in comparison to normal objects (see Fig. 8 of Foley &\nKasen 2011) on theoretical grounds.\nUsing the model light curves of KP07, we can explore\nhow the rise time of HV objects will differ from that of\nnormal objects. If all other parameters are equal (i.e., Nickel\nmass, kinetic energy, etc.), the KP07 model predicts that HV\nSNe should have shorter rise times in B compared to normal\nSNe (as indicated by the model light curves in their Fig. 11)\ndue to the enhanced line opacity from Fe-group elements.\nAlthough not specifically stated by KP07, one would expect\nthe V -band rise time of the two subclasses to be similar,\nsince the opacity in this wavelength range is dominated by\nelectron scattering.\nConsequently, the KP07 models also predict that the\nenhanced opacity at blue wavelengths from HV components\nin the SN ejecta reduce the peak absolute B-band magnitude and hasten the evolution of the B-band light curve,\nproducing a larger \u2206m15 (B). This complicates a direct comparison between the rise time of HV and normal SNe and\ndoes not necessarily predict the observed result in the left\npanel of Figure 6, that HV SNe lie on a locus of points below\nthat of normal SNe in the \u2206m15 (B)\u2013tr plane. One expectation of the KP07 models is a \u2206m15 (B) distribution for\nHV objects that is pushed to larger values in comparison\nto normal objects. We find a median \u2206m15 (B)= 1.09 mag\nfor the HV objects and a median \u2206m15 (B)= 1.11 mag for\nthe normal objects. However, our sample is most likely not\nrepresentative of a complete sample of SNe Ia and suffers\nfrom observational bias.\nWithout quantifying how HV ejecta change both\n\u2206m15 (B) and tr , we cannot definitively claim that the models of KP07 explain our result. While it is beyond the scope\nof this paper to match theoretical models to our observations, the KP07 models offer a possible qualitative explanation for why there are significant differences between HV\nand normal SNe in the B band, but not in the V band.\nRecent work by Maeda et al. (2010) finds evidence that\nSNe with a high velocity gradient (HVG) in the Si II line\nmay be the natural result of viewing an asymmetric explosion. HVG SNe are defined by Benetti et al. (2005) as\nSNe that exhibit a time derivative in the velocity of the\nSi II line > 70 km s\u22121 d\u22121 around maximum light. Benetti\net al. provide evidence that the HV and HVG subclassifications are highly correlated. Looking at the Fe II \u03bb7155\nand Ni II \u03bb7378 nebular emission in late-time spectra that\ntrace the deflagration ashes, Maeda et al. find that HVG SNe\ntend to exhibit redshifted lines while low-velocity gradient\n(LVG) SNe show a blueshift. The authors attribute this ob-\n\nservational distinction to the difference between viewing an\nasymmetric explosion from the side nearest the site of initial\ndeflagration (LVG) and the opposite side (HVG). The models of asymmetric explosions of SNe Ia presented by Maeda\net al. (2011, hereafter M11) indicate that viewing a SN from\nthe far side, one expects HVG SNe to have longer bolometric rise times and smaller \u2206m15 (B) than comparable LVG\nSNe. This effect is more prominent in SNe with less 56 Ni\n(for instance, compare models A0.3 and A0.6 in Fig. 11 of\nM11). The longer rise times in HVG objects is attributed to\nan increased optical depth for optical photons when viewing\nthe explosion from the side opposite the explosion site (i.e.,\nthe site of 56 Ni synthesis).\nThis is not necessarily inconsistent with our observational result that the HV SNe have a different rise-time distribution than normal SNe. If we view the SN from the side\nnearest the initial explosion site, we will see a LVG SN,\nand if we view the SN from the opposite side, we will see\na HVG SN. Assuming HVG implies HV, we will measure a\nlonger rise time and a smaller \u2206m15 (B) for a high-velocity\nobject assuming the B band roughly traces the bolometric behaviour. This will move the HV object up and to the\nleft of a normal SN in the \u2206m15 (B)\u2013tr plane (Fig. 6). Depending on how the viewing angle affects both rise time and\n\u2206m15 (B), the models of M11 could put the locus of HV\npoints below that of normal SNe. However, the models presented in M11 do not outright predict a difference in rise\ntimes of HV objects in the B and V bands.\nThe models of KP07 and M11 offer opposite theoretical predictions for the rise time of HV SNe in comparison to normal SNe. KP07 predict that HV SNe should have\nlarger \u2206m15 (B) and shorter rise times than normal SNe,\nwhile M11 predict smaller \u2206m15 (B) and longer rise times.\nThe differences are rooted in the nature of the SN asymmetry (i.e., the distribution of intermediate-mass elements\nand 56 Ni) and the treatment of opacity. KP07 use an expansion opacity formalism which sums over individual lines,\nwhile M11 use a frequency averaged gray opacity. A better\ntest of the HV models may possibly be found by looking\nat the \u2206m15 (B) distributions of a complete SNe Ia sample,\nsince both models predict that that asymmetries should influence the measured \u2206m15 (B). Wang et al. (2009) found\nthe \u2206m15 (B) distribution of HV and normal SNe to be\nstrikingly similar despite different Bmax \u2212Vmax distributions,\nalthough it is not clear that their sample is complete.\nDespite evidence that HV objects have different risetime properties than normal SNe, a clear physical picture\nremains elusive. Further efforts in modeling HV objects may\nshed light on the rise-time distribution of the different spectroscopic subclassifications.\n4.3\n\nThe Rise Minus Fall Distribution\n\nIn the top two panels of Figure 7, we compare the rise time\nminus the fall time (RMF) as a function of \u2206m15 (B) for\nthe B band (left panel) and \u2206m15 (V ) for the V band (right\npanel). Note that the RMF has not been stretch corrected.\nAs in Figure 6, blue squares refer to SN 1991T/SN 1999aalike objects, red stars refer to HV SNe Ia, and black circles\nrefer to spectroscopically normal SNe Ia.

These quantities are not stretch corrected. Plotted as a dashed black line is the prediction using a\nsingle-stretch prescription where there is a one-to-one mapping of rise time to fall time. The nonlinearity in the prediction is due to the\nquadratic relationship between sf and \u2206m15 (B) in Equation 4. There is significant scatter about the line. We find that slowly declining\nSNe tend to have a faster rise than predicted by the single-stretch model. Bottom panels: The RMF distribution in the B and V bands.\nHV objects have a shorter B-band RMF in comparison to objects which are spectroscopically normal. A K-S test indicates a < 0.01%\nchance that the two distributions are drawn from the same parent distribution. No significant difference is seen in the V -band RMF\ndistribution. SN 1999ee is the only normal SN with B-band RMF < \u22121 d, although a previous study noted HV features in spectra of\nthis object (Mazzali et al. 2005).\n\nFor the B band we use a fiducial 18.03 d rise time and for\nthe V band we use a rise time of 20.23 d based on the fallcorrected rise times found in \u00a74.1. Clearly, our sample does\nnot strictly follow a single-stretch parametrisation. Similar\nto the results of H10, a number of slowly declining objects\nhave a faster rise time (i.e., a smaller RMF) than expected\nfrom a one-stretch parametrisation in both B and V . We reiterate that based on the results of Figure 6, more luminous\nSNe have longer rise times than less luminous SNe; however,\nFigure 7 indicates that more luminous SNe have faster rise\ntimes than expected based on a single-stretch parametrisation.\nIn the bottom two panels of Figure 7, we plot the restframe B- and V -band distributions of RMF for the various\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201317\n\nsubclass identifications. In B, HV objects have a mean RMF\nof 1.55 \u00b1 0.27 d (uncertainty in the mean) in comparison\nto normal SNe that have an RMF of 2.77 \u00b1 0.20 d. The\n4\u03c3 difference in mean RMF offers evidence that the two\ndistributions may be drawn from different populations. The\nmean RMF for our sample by subclassification can be found\nin Table 4. Despite significant differences in the B band, the\nmean V -band RMFs for the spectroscopic subclassifications\nare consistent with one another.\nA Kolmogorov-Smirnoff (K-S) test finds that the two\ngroups of SNe have a \u223c 0.01% probability of being drawn\nfrom the same B-band RMF distribution and a \u223c 44% probability of being draw from the same V -band RMF distribution.

(2005) find evidence of high-velocity features\nin spectra taken before maximum light. However, we retain\nthe classification of Wang et al. (2009) and regard SN 1999ee\nas being normal.\nOur application of the K-S test indicates that HV and\nnormal objects have a high probability of being drawn from\ndifferent populations. However, the K-S test does not reveal\nwhether this difference is physical in origin or a reflection of\nobservational bias. For instance, the difference in RMF between the two populations may also be a result of different\nstretch distributions. Such differences cannot be disentangled without knowledge of the observational bias in each of\nthe photometric surveys used in our sample. Future surveys\nwith proper spectroscopic follow-up observations and understanding of biases will aid in exploring the difference in RMF\ndistribution for HV and normal SNe.\nOur sample also includes 6 objects which show spectroscopic similarities to the overluminous SN 1991T or SN\n1999aa. Based on the B- and V -band distribution of RMF\nfor SN 1991T/1999a-like objects, these objects have slightly\nlarger RMFs compared to normal and HV objects, however,\nthe mean of the 1991T/1999aa-like distribution is consistent\nwith the normal objects within 1\u03c3.\nS07 find evidence for two distinct RMF distributions\nusing eight SNe. While we have presented evidence for distinct HV and normal populations, S07 only have a single\nHV object in their sample (SN 2002bo). The other seven\nSNe are classified as normal by the criterion of Wang et al.\n(2009). We do not see evidence for two populations of rise\ntimes within our spectroscopically normal SNe.\nSimilar to the results of H10, we find that our sample does not follow the expectation from a one-stretch\nparametrisation of light-curve shape. This is especially evident in V , where the trend appears to go in the opposite\ndirection predicted by a single-stretch fit.\n\n4.4\n\nRise-Time Power Law\n\nPreviously, we assumed the rise in flux took the form of a\nparabola, n = 2, based on physical arguments presented in\n\u00a73.1. In this section, we fit for the functional form of the\nrising portion of the light curve (\u03c4 6 \u221210 d) as a power\nlaw of the form f = A(\u03c4 + tr )n , where tr is the rise time.\nAllowing n to vary, we perform a \u03c72 minimization to find\nthe best-fit power law to our B-band photometry. However,\nunlike the analysis in previous sections, we restrict our twostretch fitting procedure to \u221210 < \u03c4 < +35 d in order to\navoid imposing a shape on the region we plan to fit. We find\na best fit of n = 2.20+0.27\n\u22120.19 , consistent (1\u03c3) with the expanding fireball modeled by a parabola. The uncertainty in the\npower-law index is found using a Monte Carlo simulation\n\nsimilar to that outlined in \u00a73.3 except modified to only fit\nwithin the region \u221210 < \u03c4 < 35 d.\nOur result is in agreement with that of C06, who find\nn = 1.8 \u00b1 0.2, and H10, who find n = 1.80+0.23\n\u22120.18 . However,\nH10 show evidence of significant colour evolution during this\nperiod of light-curve evolution, challenging our assumption\nof modest temperature change. They find a linear B \u2212 V\ncolour evolution of 0.5 mag between 15 d and 9 d before\nmaximum light, leading to a temporal dependence closer to\nn \u2248 4 rather than the n = 2 predicted by an expanding\nfireball.\nWe check for similar evidence of colour evolution in the\nexpanding fireball phase in our sample. Using the colour\ncurves for SNe in the range of \u221215 < \u03c4 < \u22129 d relative\nto maximum light, we create a median B \u2212 V colour curve\nsimilar to the analysis presented by H10. We divide the data\ninto 1 d interval bins and take the median B \u2212 V colour for\neach bin. Corrections for Milky Way extinction were made\nusing the dust maps provided by Schlegel et al. (1998). No\ncorrections were attempted for possible host-galaxy extinction. Our median colour curve shows a small change of 0.05\nmag over the 6 d interval. However, inspecting the B \u2212 V\ncolour curve for SN 2009ig in this range, we find a drop\nof 0.5 mag over the same interval, similar to what is reported by H10. This leads us to suspect that our median\ncolour curve does not necessarily reflect the full sample, and\nat least in individual SNe, there can be significant colour\nchange at \u03c4 < \u22129 d. The discrepancy between the median\ncolour curve and that of SN 2009ig may be a result of using\nnoisy data in the earliest time bins for the median colour\ncurve.\n4.5\n\nCompanion Interaction\n\nRecently, Kasen (2010) proposed using emission produced\nfrom the collision of the SN ejecta with its companion star\nto probe the progenitor system. Similar to the shock breakout in core-collapse SNe that is theoretically well understood\n(e.g., Klein & Chevalier 1978; Matzner & McKee 1999) and\nobserved (e.g., Soderberg et al. 2008; Modjaz et al. 2009), in\nthe single-degenerate progenitor scenario the expanding SN\nejecta are expected to collide with the extended envelope of\nthe mass donating companion. In the case of a companion\nundergoing Roche-lobe overflow, the radius of the companion is on the same order of magnitude as the separation\ndistance. The timing and luminosity emitted from the interaction will depend on the mass of the companion and the\nseparation distance. The shock emission is expected to be\nbrightest in the ultraviolet, but detectable in the B band.\nHayden et al. (2010b) looked for this signal in the rising portion of the B-band light curves of 108 SDSS SNe Ia, finding\nno strong evidence of a shock signature in the data. Using\nsimulated light curves produced with SNANA (Kessler et al.\n2009) and a Gaussian to model the shock interaction, the\nauthors constrain the companion in the single-degenerate\nscenario to be less than a 6 M main-sequence star, strongly\ndisfavouring red giants (RGs) undergoing Roche-lobe overflow.\nFor this analysis, we focus on our B-band data where\nwe have the best chance of detecting the signs of shock emission. Kasen (2010) predicts that in the initial few days after explosion, the luminosity produced by the interaction\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201317\n\n\fRise Times of Nearby SNe Ia\n\n\"#&\n\ntr = 17.92 d\nn=2\na13= 0\nf=0\n\n\"#%\n\"#$\n\n)*+,-./012!A1>/24-.\n\n)*+,-./012!3.45\n\n\"#'\n\n(#\"\nr$B2*8!C!$&$#&&B&'\n\n\"#\"\n\"#%\n\"#$\n\"#\"\n\u00ef\"#$\n\u00ef\"#%\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n\u00ef(6\n\u00ef(\"\n\u00ef6\n78819:/;1!<-=>!?->:!@-5/,4,\n\n!\n\n\"\n\n)*+,-./012!3.45\n\ntr = 17.11 d\nn=2\na13= 0.9\nf = 0.1\n\n\"#%\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n\u00ef(6\n\u00ef(\"\n\u00ef6\n78819:/;1!<-=>!?->:!@-5/,4,\n\n\"#'\n\n!\n\n!\n\n\"\n\nr$B2*8!C!$D6#E'B&'\n\n\"#&\n\ntr = 17.11 d\nn = 1.8\na13= 0.2\nf = 0.1\n\n\"#%\n\"#$\n\n!\n\n\"\n\n)*+,-./012!A1>/24-.\n\n)*+,-./012!3.45\n\n!\n\n(#\"\n\n\"#$\n)*+,-./012!A1>/24-.\n\ntr = 17.92 d\nn = 2.2\na13= 0.5\nf = 0.1\n\n\"#%\n\n\u00ef(6\n\u00ef(\"\n\u00ef6\n78819:/;1!<-=>!?->:!@-5/,4,\n\nr$B2*8!C!$D%#%(B&'\n\n\"#&\n\n\"#\"\n\"#%\n\"#$\n\"#\"\n\u00ef\"#$\n\u00ef\"#%\n\nr$B2*8!C!$&$#$6B&'\n\n\"#&\n\n\"#\"\n\"#%\n\"#$\n\"#\"\n\u00ef\"#$\n\u00ef\"#%\n\n(#\"\n\"#'\n\n\"#'\n\n\"#$\n)*+,-./012!A1>/24-.\n\n)*+,-./012!3.45\n\n(#\"\n\n13\n\n\"#\"\n\"#%\n\"#$\n\"#\"\n\u00ef\"#$\n\u00ef\"#%\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n\u00ef(6\n\u00ef(\"\n\u00ef6\n78819:/;1!<-=>!?->:!@-5/,4,\n\n!\n\n\"\n\nFigure 8. Two-stretch corrected B-band light curves compared to the expected flux of a collision between the SN ejecta and a 1 M\ncompanion assuming the companion is undergoing Roche-lobe overflow. Only data in the range \u221210 < \u03c4 < +35 d are used to stretch\ncorrect the light curves, to avoid imposing a shape onto data at \u03c4 6 \u221210 d. Plotted as a red line is the light-curve template with no\nshock interaction assuming various power laws for the initial rise, indicated by n, and rise times, tr . Plotted as a blue dashed line is\nthe expected \"shocked template,\" which is the expected shock emission added to the template assuming different separation distances\na13 and the fraction of SN explosions that show signs of interaction, f . The expected flux from the companion is estimated using the\nanalytic models of Kasen (2010). The bottom plot for each panel shows the resulting normalised residual curve between the data and\nthe \"shocked template.\" We find a considerable degree of degeneracy between the adopted rise time, the power-law index for the initial\nrise, and the shock emission. As the four plots indicate, a similar minimum reduced \u03c72 can be achieved with n = 2, tr = 17.92 d and no\nshock emission (top left) or by varying the rise time, power-law index, and amount of shock emission (top right, bottom left, and bottom\nright, respectively).\n\nwith the companion will dominate the luminosity powered\nby 56 Ni decay. Inspection of individual light-curve fits with\nthe two-stretch fitting routine do not show the tell-tale signs\nof strong interaction. To take advantage of the power in\nnumbers, we analyse all of the light curves as an ensemble.\nWe then compare data from the earliest light-curve epochs\nto the models of Kasen (2010) to place constraints on the\nmass and distance to the companion.\nWe start by applying our two-stretch fitting routine\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201317\n\nagain, but limiting the fit to data \u221210 < \u03c4 < +35 d in\norder to avoid forcing a shape on the earliest data and possibly suppressing the signature of interaction. We construct\nmodels of \"shocked\" template light curves including contributions from companion interaction using the analytic solutions for the properties of the emission found by Kasen\n(2010). Using equations for Lc,iso and Teff from Kasen (2010)\n(Eq. 22 and 25, respectively) and assuming the emission is\nthat of a blackbody, we calculate the expected flux density\n\n\f14\n\nGaneshalingam, Li, & Filippenko\n\nat the peak of the B band (\u03bbeff = 4450 \u00c5) at a distance of\n10 pc. We normalise the flux density from the shock to a\npeak SN Ia magnitude of MB = \u221219.3 mag.\nBased on the opening angle of the shock interaction,\nKasen (2010) predicts that the interaction signature should\nbe visible in \u223c 10% of SN Ia explosions. Ideally, one should\naccount for the viewing angle dependence of the detected\nshock emission. We make the simplification that we are\neither looking along the axis or we are not. Our lightcurve models including the effects of interaction are the unshocked template plus a fraction, f , of the collision flux calculated using the analytic model of Kasen (2010). A model\nwith f = 0 represents a situation in which shock emission\nis never detectable (and reduces to the unshocked template)\nand f = 1 is a scenario in which shock emission is detectable\nin every SN explosion.\nFor most of the analysis in this paper, we adopted an\nexpanding fireball model for the early rise of the light curve\n(\u03c4 6 \u221210 d) which assumed a power-law index of n = 2.\nUnder this assumption, we found that our early-time data\nwere best fit by a rise time of 17.92 d. However, as discussed\nin \u00a74.4, the assumption that the initial rise of the light curve\nhas n = 2 may be somewhat questionable given rather significant changes in SN colour at early phases. As a test of the\ndegeneracies between the added shock emission and the assumptions that go into constructing an unshocked template,\nwe consider a number of different templates with different\nrise times and power-law indices. In addition to our nominal\ntemplate with tr = 17.92 d and n = 2, we also try templates\nwith tr = 17.11 d and n = 2, tr = 17.92 d and n = 2.2, and\ntr = 17.11 d and n = 1.8.\nThe parameters free to vary in the model for shock interaction are a13 , the distance to the companion normalised\nto 1013 cm, Mc , the companion mass, and f , the fraction of\nSN explosions that produce detectable shock emission. For\nthis simple analysis the probed mass is fixed at Mc = 1 M ,\nto explore RGs as a possible companion, and we set f equal\nto either 0 (i.e., no emission is detected) or 0.1, the expected\nfraction of SNe with detectable shock emission based on the\nopening angle of the shock. For each of our four different\nunshocked templates, we calculate the minimum \u03c72 statistic for models by varying a13 to find the best-fit shocked\ntemplate. The fit is restricted to data within the range of\n\u221216 6 \u03c4 6 \u221210 d.\nWe note that the minimum reduced \u03c72 in all of our fits\nfor a13 exceeds 1 and is usually closer to 3\u20134. This is not\ncompletely unexpected since data at \u03c4 6 \u221210 d were not included in the two-stretch fitting procedure used to normalise\nthe light curves, and this may induce correlated errors into\nthe data at \u03c4 6 \u221210 d. We also suspect that the reported\nerrors for the earliest photometry epochs may be underestimated. Furthermore, the scatter in the data points may even\nbe the physical result of a distribution of companion masses,\nseparation distances, and viewing angles contributing to the\nemitted flux from shock interaction. Unfortunately, we are\nnot in a position to disentangle what is contributing to the\nscatter.\nOur final results for each template are shown in Figure\n8. Plotted in red are the unshocked templates and in blue\nare the shocked templates including some contribution of\ncompanion interaction. In each case of an unshocked template, we can find an acceptable fit with similar \u03c72 by vary-\n\ning the separation distance. There is a significant degree of\ndegeneracy between the parameters, making the task of disentangling the true sign of companion interaction at this\nlevel extremely difficult. For instance, for our template with\nn = 2 and tr = 17.92 d, we do not see signs of any interaction. However, had we used a template with n = 2 and\ntr = 17.11 d, we would find that if the fraction of SNe that\nshowed signs of shock interaction is f = 0.1, then \u03c72 is minimised with a13 = 0.9. Similarly, when varying n and tr in\nthe unshocked template, suitable matches to the data can\nbe found by adjusting the amount of shock interaction.\nThe degeneracy is partially broken by increasing the\ncontribution of companion interaction to the \"shocked template\" by either increasing f or a13 . Fixing f = 0.1 based on\nthe expected opening angle of the shock, a13 = 2 increases\nthe reduced \u03c72 by more than 1 for all of our unshocked\ntemplates.\nIn summary, we find that with our limited sample of\nearly-time data, we cannot completely disentangle the behaviour of the power-law index, the adopted rise time, and\nthe amount of companion interaction. This result makes use\nof all of the light-curve data at \u03c4 6 \u221210 d as an ensemble.\nBetter constraints could be placed on individual, excellently\nsampled light curves in the rise region. In particular, efforts\nto obtain data at bluer wavelengths, where the shock interaction is stronger and more easily detectable, will greatly\nhelp to break degeneracies in the fitting process.\nRecently, Justham (2011) and Di Stefano et al. (2011)\nhave argued that the transfer of angular momentum from\nthe companion donor star to the C/O white dwarf acts to\nincrease the critical mass required to explode and the time\nrequired for the white dwarf to explode. Consequently, the\ndonor star may possibly evolve past the red giant phase,\nvastly reducing the cross section for interaction with SN\nejecta. The subsequent shock emission for a RG would decrease beyond current detection limits, thus saving RGs as\na possible donor in the single-degenerate scenario. The increased time to explosion allows the mass ejected from the\nenvelope of the donor star time to diffuse to the density of\nthe ambient interstellar medium, offering an explanation for\nthe tight constraints placed on the presence of H\u03b1 in nebular\nspectra of SNe Ia (Leonard 2007, and references therein).\n4.6\n\nSN 1991bg-Like Objects\n\nThe analysis presented thus far has excluded SN 1991bglike objects due to fits which had unacceptably large \u03c72 per\ndegree of freedom. To investigate what was causing the poor\nfits, we focus on the B-band light curve of the SN 1991bg-like\nSN 1999by from the LOSS sample, which has data starting\nabout \u221210 d before maximum light in the B band. As seen in\nFigure 9, the largest difference in light-curve shape between\nSN 1999by and our template occurs at t > +10 d, where\nthe light curve of SN 1999by transitions to a slower linear\ndecline not seen until t > +30 d in normal SNe Ia. Similar\ndifferences in light-curve shape for SN 1991bg are found by\nFilippenko et al. (1992b) and Leibundgut et al. (1993). The\nfit parameters of sf and sr are correlated; thus, a bad fit\nfor sf will propagate into an incorrect determination of sr .\nGiven the different light-curve shapes for SN 1991bg-like\nobjects and normal objects for t > 10 d, we are unable to\nacceptably fit sf and thus sr . For the purposes of exploring\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201317\n\n\fRise Times of Nearby SNe Ia\n\nSN 1999by\nLOSS (tr=13.33 d)\n\n1.0\n\nNormalized Flux\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\u221220\n\n\u221210\n\n0\n10\n20\nDays Past Maximum\n\n30\n\nFigure 9.

The light-curve evolution of SN\n1999by for t > 10 d past maximum makes it impossible to find a\nreasonable fit using our two-stretch fitting routine. If we restrict\nour fit to the pre-maximum portion of the light curve, we find a\nrise time of 13.33 \u00b1 0.40 d.\n\nthe rise time of SN 1991bg-like objects, we restrict our fit\nto the pre-maximum portion of the light curve using the\ndate of maximum found with a low-order polynomial fit.\nFor SN 1999by, we find a best-fit rise time of 13.33 \u00b1 0.40 d\n(overplotted as dashed lines in Fig. 9), indicating that they\njoin other objects with large \u2206m15 (B) as the fastest risers\nin our sample.

Most of the reported results\nare not highly sensitive to fitting cuts. Restricting acceptable fits to reduced \u03c72 = 1.5, a first epoch at \u03c4 = \u221210 d,\nand \u03c3tr,f = 1 d decreases the number of available objects to 26 normal, 9 HV, and 3 SN 1991T/SN 1999aa-like\nSNe Ia. The probability that the B-band RMF populations\nare drawn from the same parent population increases to\n\u223c 4%. The difference in the B-band fall-time corrected rise\ntime, tr 0 , between HV and normal SNe remains significant at\n\u22121.44\u00b10.49 d, indicating a faster rise for HV objects. Relaxing constraints to a reduced \u03c72 = 2, first epoch at \u03c4 = \u22125 d\nrelative to maximum light, and \u03c3tr,f = 1.5 d increases the\ndifference in fall-stretch corrected B-band rise time between\nHV and normal objects to \u22121.86 \u00b1 0.49 d. The V -band rise\ntimes remain consistent between HV and normal objects, as\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201317\n\n15\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe have presented an analysis of the rise-time distribution\nof nearby SNe Ia in the B and V bands. Using a twostretch fitting technique, we find that the SN rise time is\ncorrelated with the decline rate in the sense that SNe with\nbroader light curves post-maximum (i.e., light curves with\nsmall \u2206m15 (B)/\u2206m15 (V )) have longer rise times. While SN\n1991bg-like objects could not be fit well by our two-stretch\nfitting procedure, we found that restricting our analysis to\nthe pre-maximum data for the SN 1991bg-like SN 1999by\ngives a rise time of 13.33 \u00b1 0.40 d. This follows the expected\ntrend of a fast rise leading to a fast decline.\nUsing a sample of 105 SDSS SNe at intermediate redshifts (0.037 6 z 6 0.230), H10 find that there is a great\ndiversity in B-band rise times for a fixed \u2206m15 (B), and\nthat the slowest declining SNe tend to have the fastest rise\ntimes. While we do see evidence for scatter in rise times with\n\u2206m15 (B), we find a strong correlation between \u2206m15 (B)\nand rise time in the sense that slowly declining SNe Ia have\nlonger rise times. This correlation is strong in the B band,\nbut weaker in the V band. The discrepancy with H10 may\nbe a result of combining B- and V -band stretches which was\navoided in this analysis.\nWe find that a single value of the stretch does not adequately describe the rising and falling portions of our light\ncurves. Similar to the results in H10, more luminous SNe\nwith longer fall times have shorter rise times than one would\nexpect from a single-stretch prescription for light curves.\nThis is especially evident in our analysis of V -band light\ncurves. However, we reiterate that while luminous SNe have\nshorter rise times than expected from a single-stretch prescription, they still have longer rise times than less luminous\nSNe, contrary to the findings of H10.\nR99 and C06 found a fiducial B-band rise time of\n\u223c 19.5 d for a \"typical\" SN Ia. In a departure from previous\nresults, H10 report an average rise time of 17.38 \u00b1 0.18 d.\nWe find a fall-stretch corrected (i.e., corrected to have a\npost-maximum fall of \u2206m15 (B) = 1.1 mag) B-band rise\ntime of 18.03 \u00b1 0.24 d for spectroscopically normal SNe and\n16.63 \u00b1 0.30 d for HV SNe. Our B-band rise time for spectroscopically normal SNe with \u2206m15 (B) = 1.1 mag is in\nagreement with the average rise time found by H10 at the\n2.2\u03c3 level. When correcting our V -band light curves to a\npost-maximum fall of \u2206m15 (V ) = 0.66 mag, we find a fallstretch corrected V -band rise time of 20.23 \u00b1 0.44 d.\nAfter correcting for post-maximum decline rate, HV\nSNe Ia have faster rise times than normal SNe Ia in the\nB band, but similar rise times in V . We find a \u223c 3\u03c3 difference in the fall-stretch corrected rise time between HV\nand normal SNe in the B band. The rise minus fall (RMF)\ndistributions (not corrected for stretch) of the two subclassifications show significant differences in the two populations.\nThe peak values of the distributions are offset by 1.22\u00b10.34 d\nin the B band, with HV objects having a faster rise time.\nA K-S test indicates a \u223c 0.01% probability that HV SNe\ncome from the same parent RMF population as normal SNe\nin the B band. Despite differences in the B band, we see no\n\n\f16\n\nGaneshalingam, Li, & Filippenko\n\nevidence of a difference in the RMF populations in the V\nband.\nBased on the model presented by Foley & Kasen (2011)\nand the models of KP07, we offer a possible qualitative explanation for why HV SNe should have a different B-band\nrise-time distribution than normal SNe, but similar V -band\ndistributions. The physical origin of the difference is possibly\nrooted in the different opacity mechanisms at work in the\nB and V bands. Line blanketing from Fe-group elements is\nthe dominant source of opacity for wavelengths shorter than\n\u223c 4300 \u00c5, the peak of the B band. At longer wavelengths,\nsuch as the V band, electron scattering is the dominant\nsource of opacity. Rapidly moving ejecta, as is the case with\nHV objects, will broaden absorption features, diminishing\nthe B-band flux without affecting the V -band flux. Models from KP07 show that all other things being equal (e.g.,\nNi mass, kinetic energy), this leads to faster light curves\nwith larger \u2206m15 (B) for HV objects. However, the enhanced\nopacity at short wavelengths also affects \u2206m15 (B), complicating the application of the models to our result. Further\nmodeling and observations of HV SNe Ia are required to\nshed light on the photometric differences of this spectroscopic subclass.\nWe fit the earliest data in our sample (\u03c4 6 \u221210 d) to\nfind that the flux rises as a power law with index 2.20+0.27\n\u22120.19 .\nThis is consistent with the unimpeded, free expansion of\nthe expanding fireball toy model that predicts an index of\n2. However, a preliminary analysis of SN 2009ig in the range\n\u221215 < \u03c4 < \u22129 d shows evidence of significant colour evolution, contrary to the assumption of little to no colour evolution in the expanding fireball model. H10 find similar colour\nevolution in an analysis of the B \u2212 V colour curve of SDSS\nSNe Ia and derive an expected power-lax index of 4.\nWe compare our early-time B-band data as an ensemble to models (Kasen 2010) of shock interaction produced\nfrom SN ejecta colliding with the mass-donating companion\nin the single-degenerate progenitor scenario. When relaxing\nour assumptions on the functional form of the early-time\ntemplate light-curve behaviour (i.e., changing the rise time\nor power-law index of the rise), we find that our data require some amount of shock interaction to remove systematic trends. This indicates a level of degeneracy between the\nadopted template rise time, the power-law index, and the\namount of shock interaction required to match the data.\nFuture surveys with high-cadence search strategies will\nprovide well-sampled SN light curves starting days after explosion, substantially adding to the sample of rise-time measurements. Complemented with spectroscopic follow-up observations, analysis of the RMF distribution can be further\nbroken into different spectroscopic classes to provide insights\ninto the underlying populations and the physics that differentiates them.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank the Lick Observatory staff for their assistance\nwith the operation of KAIT.
