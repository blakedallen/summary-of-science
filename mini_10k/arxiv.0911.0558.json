[1, 2, 3, 4] Peculiar electronic properties of graphene give\nrise possibility to come over silicon-based electronics limitations. [5] The single-particle energy spectrum in graphene contains two zero-energy at K + and K \u2212 points of the Brillouin\nzone which are called as valleys or Dirac points. Due to the presence of the two carbon\natoms per unit cell, the quasiparticle (QP) need to be described by a two component wave\nfunction.\nThe charge carriers in a pristine graphene show linear and isotropic energy dispersion relation and massless chiral behavior for the energy scales up to 1 eV. Recently, graphene has\nrevealed a variety of unusual transport phenomena characteristics of two-dimensional (2D)\nDirac Fermions such as an anomalous integer quantum Hall effect at room temperature, a\nminimum quantum conductivity, Klein tunneling paradox, weak and anti-localization, an\nabsence of Wigner crystallization phase and Shubnikov-deHaas oscillations that exhibit a\nphase shift of \u03c0 due to Berry's phase. [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] One important difference between\nconventional electron gas and Dirac Fermion particle is that the contribution of exchange\nand correlation to the chemical potential is an increasing rather than a decreasing function\nof carrier-density. This property implies that exchange and correlation increase the effectiveness of screening, in contrast to the usual case in which exchange and correlation weakens\nscreening. This unusual property follows from the difference in sublattice pseudospin chirality between the Dirac model's negative energy valence band states and its conduction band\nstates.\nThe massless Dirac-like carriers in graphene have almost semi-ballistic transport behavior with small resistance due to the suppression of back-scattering process, and moreover\ngraphene is a good thermal conductor. [13] The mobility of carriers in graphene is quite\nhigh [14, 15, 16, 17] which is much higher than the electron mobility revealed on the semiconductor hetrostructures. [18, 19] On the other hand, by measuring the stiffness of materials\nit is shown that graphene is the strongest material in two-dimension structures. [20, 21] These\nproperties as well as capability to control of the type and density of charge carriers by gate\nvoltage or the chemical doping [22, 23, 24, 25] make graphene an ideal candidate for superior\n2\n\n\fnano-electronic devices operating at high frequencies.\nMost electronic applications are based on the presence of a gap between the valence and\nconduction bands in the conventional semiconductors. The band gap is a measure of the\nthreshold voltage and on-off ratio of the field effect transistors (FETs). [26, 27] Therefore,\nfor integrating graphene into semiconductor technology, it is crucial to induce a band gap\nin Dirac points to control the transport of carriers. Consequently, band gap engineering\nin graphene is a hot topic with fundamental and applied significance. [28] In the literature\nseveral routes have being proposed and applied to induce and control a gap in graphene. One\nof them is using quantum confined geometries such as quantum dots and nanoribbons. [29,\n30, 31, 32, 33] It is shown that the gap values increases by decreasing of nanoribbon width.\nAnother alternative way is spin-orbit coupling whose origin is due to both intrinsic spin-orbit\ninteractions and the Rashba interaction. [34, 35, 36, 37] Another method to generate a gap\nin graphene sheets is an inversion symmetry breaking of the sublattices when the number\nof electrons on A and B atoms are different [38, 39, 40, 41] or Kekul\u00e9 [42] distortion, e.g.\ngraphene on proper substrates [24, 25, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48] or adsorb of some molecules\nsuch as water, ammonia [51, 52] and CrO3 [53] or an alkali-metal sub-monolayer on graphene\nsheets.\nRecently angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( ARPES) experiments on graphene\nepitaxially grown on SiC and ab initio simulations reported a gap opening in the band\nstructure of graphene placed on proper substrates, and suggested that interactions between\nthe graphene sheet and the substrate leads to symmetry breaking of the A and B sublattices\nand it consequences to induce a gap in the band structure. Experimenters [24, 25, 43, 44, 54]\nobserved a gap of 260 meV in band structure of the epitaxial graphene on SiC substrate\ndue to interaction with substrate. In addition, Zhou et al. [24] found a reversible metalinsulator transition and a fine tuning of the carriers from electron to hole by molecular\ndoping in gapped graphene. A Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation confirmed a\nsubstrate induced symmetry breaking. [55]. Their results showed a gap in the band spectra\nof graphene about 200 meV which is in agreement with recent experimental observation.\nTheir calculation determined that there is a 140 meV on-site energy difference between\ntwo sublattices. In addition, a band gap is observed in spectra of graphene on Ni(111)\nsubstrate [45, 46] as well as a gap about of 10 meV in suspended graphene above a graphite\nsubstrate [47] due to sublattice symmetry breaking mechanism. Moreover, based on the ab\n3\n\n\finitio calculations, it is suggested that boron nitride substrate induced a gap of 53 meV. [48]\nNote that the gap value calculated within DFT is in general underestimating the true band\ngap value.\nIn this paper we consider the sublattice symmetry breaking mechanism for a gap opening in a pristine doped graphene sheet and study the impact of gap upon some electronic\nproperties of QPs. To investigate the influence of gap in the many-body properties of QP\nin graphene we use the random phase approximation (RPA) and the G0 W approximation.\nIt should be noted that a detailed analysis provided a framework for the microscopic evaluation of the QP-QP interaction in the gapless graphene by means of the RPA was carried\nout by us in Ref. [49] At the beginning, we review briefly the results of the ground state\nthermodynamic properties that we have already presented elsewhere. [50] Our new results\nare based on the QP self-energy properties in the presence of a gap opening in the electronic\nspectrum. From the self-energy we then obtain the QP energies, renormalized Fermi velocity, spectral function which can be compared with ARPES spectra and finally the band gap\nrenormalization of massive Dirac Fermions in doped graphene. We have shown that mass\ngenerating in graphene washes out a satellite band in the spectral function in agreement\nwith recent experimental observations. [43]\nThis paper is organized as followed. In Section II we introduce our model Hamiltonian\nand then review some ground state properties of gapped graphene. In Section III we focus\non the properties of imaginary and real parts of self- energy for gapped graphene and then\ncalculate QP spectral function, renormalized Fermi velocity and band gap renormalization.\nFinally we conclude in Section IV.\n\nII.\n\nGROUND STATE THERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES\n\nWe consider the sublattice symmetry breaking mechanism in which the densities of particles associated to on-site energy \u03bca(b) , for A(B) sublattice are different. The electronic\nstructure of graphene can be reasonably good described using a rather simple tight-binding\nHamiltonian, leading to analytical solutions for their energy dispersion and related eigenstates. The noninteracting tight binding Hamiltonian for \u03c0 band electrons is determined\n\n4\n\n\fby [38, 39, 40, 41]\nX \u2020\nX \u2020\nX \u2020\n\u01240 = t\n(ai bi + c.c.) + \u03bca\nai ai + \u03bcb\nbi bi\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\nX \u2020\n\u03bca + \u03bcb X \u2020\n\u03bca \u2212 \u03bcb X \u2020\n= t\n(ai bi + c.c.) +\n(ai ai \u2212 b\u2020i bi ) +\n(ai ai + b\u2020i bi )\n2\n2\ni\ni\ni\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the sums run over unit cells, t \u2243 2.7 eV denotes the nearest neighbor hopping parameter and ai (bi ) is Fermi annihilation operator acts on A(B) sublattice. The second term\nin the noninteracting Hamiltonian breaks the inversion symmetry and causes to a band gap\nwith value of 2\u2206 = |\u03bca \u2212 \u03bcb | at the Dirac points. The last term is a constant and we\nleft it out. The effective Hamiltonian at low excited energies lead to a 2D massive Dirac\nHamiltonian, \u01240 = ~vF~\u03c3 * k + \u2206\u03c33 , where ~\u03c3 are Pauli matrices and vF = 3ta/2~ \u2243 106 m/s\nis the Fermi velocity where a \u2243 1.42 \u00c5 is the carbon-carbon distance in honeycomb lattice.\np\nThe two eigenvalues of noninteracting Hamiltonian are given by Ek = \u00b1 (~vF k)2 + \u22062 for\n\nconduction band (+) and valance band (-) which is a fully occupied. In addition, the model\n\nHamiltonian can be used as an approximated model for describing a graphene antidot lattice\nin the vicinity of a band gap with a small effective mass value [56], or moreover used as an\neffective Hamiltonian for the intrinsic spin-orbit interaction in graphene where \u2206 = \u2206SO\nis the strength of the spin-orbit interaction. [34, 35, 36, 37] If \u03bca = \u03bcb the Hamiltonian\nreduces to massless Dirac Hamiltonian with two chiral eigenstates having the conical band\nstructures \u03b5k = \u00b1~vF k.\nWe consider the long-range Coulomb electron-electron interaction. We left out the intervalley scattering and use the two component Dirac Fermion model. Accordingly, the total\ninteracting Hamiltonian in a continuum model at K + point is expressed as [57, 58]\nX \u2020\n1 X\nVq (n\u0302q n\u0302\u2212q \u2212 N\u0302 ),\n\u0124 =\n\u03a8k,\u03c3 \u01240 \u03a8k,\u03c3 +\n2S\nq6=0\nk,\u03c3\n\n(2)\n\na\nb\nwhere \u03a8\u2020k,\u03c3 = (\u03c8+,\u03c3\n(k), \u03c8+,\u03c3\n(k)) is two component pseudospinors of the noninteracting\n\nHamiltonian, S is the sample area, N\u0302 is the total number operator and Vq = 2\u03c0e2 /\u01ebq is\nthe bare Coulomb interaction where \u01eb is an average dielectric constant of the surrounding\nmedium. The coupling constant in graphene is \u03b1gr = gs gv e2 /\u01eb~vF where gs = gv = 2 being\nthe spin and valley degeneracy, respectively. The coupling constant in graphene depends\nonly on the substrate dielectric constant while in the conventional 2D electron systems\nis density dependent. The typical value of dimensionless coupling constant is 1 or 2 for\ngraphene supported on a substrate such a SiC or SiO2 .\n5\n\n\fA central quantity in the many-body techniques is the noninteracting dynamical polarizability function \u03c7(0) (q, i\u03c9, \u03bc) where \u03bc is the chemical potential. The problem of linear\ndensity response is set up by considering a fluid described by the Hamiltonian, \u0124, which\nis subject to an external potential. The external potential must be sufficiently weak for\nlow-order perturbation theory to suffice. The induced density change has a linear relation\nto the external potential through the noninteracting dynamical polarizability function. This\nfunction is recently calculated along the imaginary frequency axis and it is given by [50]\n\u03b52q \u2206 x2\u2212\ngs gv\ny\n\u03c7 (q, i\u03c9, \u03bc \u2265 \u2206) = \u2212\n{\u03bc \u2212 \u2206 + ( 2 +\ntan\u22121 (\n))\n2\n2\n2\u03c0~ vF\n2 y\n2y\n2\u2206\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03b52q\n2\n\u22121 z(\u03bc)\n\u22121 z(\u2206)\nRe x\u2212 (sin\n\u2212 sin\n)\n\u2212\n4y\nx+\nx+\n\u0015\n\u0014\nq\nq\n\u03b52q\n(3)\n+\nRe z(\u03bc) x2+ \u2212 z 2 (\u03bc) \u2212 z(\u2206) x2+ \u2212 z 2 (\u2206) },\n4y\nq\np\nwhere x\u00b1 = 1 \u00b1 4\u22062 /(\u03b52q + ~2 \u03c9 2 ), y = \u03b52q + ~2 \u03c9 2 and z(x) = (2x + i~\u03c9)/\u03b5q . The Fermi\np\nenergy of a 2D massive Dirac Fermion system is given by EF = \u03bc = (~vF kF )2 + \u22062 and the\np\nFermi wavevector is kF = 4\u03c0n/gs gv where n is the density of carriers. The noninteracting\n(0)\n\ndensity of states (DOS) is determined by D(E) = gs gv |E|/2\u03c0~2 vF2 \u0398(E 2 \u2212 \u22062 ) which is\ndensity dependent at the Fermi surface. It should be noticed that D(EF ) equals to m/2\u03c0~2\n\nin the conventional 2D electron gas system. Here, \u0398(x) is Heaviside step function.\nWe now turn to present our first numerical results which are based on the noninteracting\npolarization function. The static polarization function as a function of wavevector for various\ngap values is shown in Fig. 1(a). The static polarization function in gapless case is a smooth\nfunction whereas a kink at q = 2kF occurs for gapped graphene and thus the derivatives of\n\u03c7(0) (q, 0, \u2206 6= 0) has a singular feature. The singular behavior is the source of several phenomena such as the Friedel oscillations and moreover the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida\n(RKKY) interaction which the later is absent in gapless graphene. In Figs. 1(b) and (c) we\nhave plotted the dynamic polarization function as a function of frequency for wave vectors\nsmaller and larger than q = 2kF , respectively. \u03c7(0) (q, i\u03c9) tends to zero like \u03c9 \u22121 at large\nfrequency region.\nThe polarization function along the real \u03c9 axis can be obtained by performing analytical\ncontinuation of Eq. (3). [50, 59, 60] In Fig. 2 we have presented the real and imaginary\nparts of the noninteracting polarization function as a function of frequency. Sharp cutoffs in\nthe imaginary part of \u03c7(0) (q, \u03c9) are related to the rapid swing in the real part of \u03c7(0) (q, \u03c9).\n6\n\n\f(b)\n\n0.8\n\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n\n(0)\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n\n1.15\n\n\u2206/\u03b5F=0\n\u2206/\u03b5F=0.5\n\u2206/\u03b5F=1\n\u2206/\u03b5F=10\n\n1.1\n1.05\n\nq=0.5kF\n\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n\n(0)\n\n1.6\n\n0.9\n\n(a)\n\n-\u03c7 (q,i\u03c9)/D(EF)\n\n(0)\n\n-\u03c7 (q,i\u03c9=0)/D(EF)\n\n1\n\n\u2206/\u03b5F=0\n\u2206/\u03b5F=0.5\n\u2206/\u03b5F=1\n\u2206/\u03b5F=10\n\n-\u03c7 (q,i\u03c9)/D(EF)\n\n2\n1.8\n\n0.3\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n0.8\n0.75\n\nq=2.5kF\n\u2206/\u03b5F=0\n\u2206/\u03b5F=0.5\n\u2206/\u03b5F=1\n\n0.65\n\n0\n0\n\n0.9\n0.85\n\n0.7\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n1\n0.95\n\n(c)\n\n0.6\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\nq/kF\n\n0.5\n\n\u03c9/\u03b5F\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n\u03c9/\u03b5F\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) (a): The static noninteracting polarization function as a function of q for\nvarious \u2206. The dimensionless noninteracting dynamic polarization at (b): q = 0.5kF and (c):\nq = 2kF as a function of \u03c9 for various \u2206.\n\nThese behaviors are in result of the fact that the real and imaginary parts of the polarization\nfunction are related through the Kramers-Kr\u00f6nig relations. Importantly, the sign change of\nthe real part from negative to positive shows a sweep across the electron-hole continuum. At\nvery large gap values, the polarization function of massive Dirac Fermions can be reduced to\nthe polarization function (the Lindhard's function) of conventional two dimensional electron\ngas systems, as they are determined in Figs. 1 and 2. Consequently, we settle under situation\nthat we can describe a range of band structures from the Dirac's cone (gapless graphene)\nto the parabolic (conventional semiconductors) band structure behavior by tuning the gap\nvalues from zero to a large value, respectively. We limited our calculations to the intermediate values of of \u2206 and we thus expect wide range of the particular properties related to\nunique behavior of the polarization function.\nWe can calculate the total ground state energy of gapped graphene within RPA. [50,\n58] The ground-state energies can be calculated using the coupling constant integration\ntechnique, which has the contributions \u03b5tot = \u03b5kin + \u03b5xc . The kinetic energy per particle is\ngiven by \u03b5kin = 2(EF3 \u2212 \u22063 )/3\u03b52F.\nAs discussed previously [50, 58] we might subtract the vacuum energy contribution from\nthe total energy, \u03b4\u03b5tot = \u03b5tot (kF ) \u2212 \u03b5tot (kF = 0). Due to the number of states in the Brillouin\nzone must be conserved, we do need a ultraviolet cut-off kc , which is approximated by\n\u03c0kc2 \u2243 (2\u03c0)2 /A0 , where A0 is the area of the unit cell. The dimensionless parameter \u039b is\n\u221a\ndefined as kc /kF \u2243 (gs gv n\u22121 3/9.09)1/2 \u00d7 102 .\nIn Fig. 3, we have shown the exchange- correlation energy in units of \u03b5F = ~vF kF , as a\n\n7\n\n\ffunction of n\u22121/2 in units of 10\u22126 cm for various \u2206 value. The exchange energy arises entirely\nfrom the antisymmetry of the many-body wave function under exchange of two electrons\nis positive while the correlation energy, the difference between the ground state energy and\nthe sum of the kinetic energy and the exchange energy is negative. This has important\nimplications on the thermodynamic properties can be calculated from the derivative of the\nground state energy with respect to the density. The compressibility can be calculated from\nits definition, \u03ba\u22121 = n2 \u2202 2 (n\u03b4\u03b5tot )/\u2202n2 . Fig. 3(b) shows the ratio between the noninteractiong\nvalue, \u03ba0 = 2/n\u03b5F and the interaction value of compressibility as a function of n\u22121/2 . The\nexchange tends to reduce the compressibility while correlations tends to enhance it. At\nlarge \u2206, a minimum structure occurs at the inverse of compressibility behavior and we\nexpect that at very large \u2206, it starts at \u03ba0 and reduces by increasing n\u22121/2 behaves like the\ncompressibility of the conversional 2D electron gas.\n8\n\n1\n\n-Re\u03c7 (q,\u03c9)/D(EF)\n\n-Re\u03c7 (q,\u03c9)/D(EF)\n\n6\n0\n\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n\u2206/\u03b5F=0\n(a) \u2206/\u03b5F=0.5\n\u2206/\u03b5F=1\n\n-4\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n\u03c9/\u03b5F\n\n0.6\n\n5\n\n(c)\n4\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0\n\nq=2.5kF\n\n-4\n\n(b)\n\n-6\n0.9\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n\u2206/\u03b5F=0\n\u2206/\u03b5F=0.5\n\u2206/\u03b5F=1\n\n\u03c9/\u03b5F\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\n7\n\n\u2206/\u03b5F=0\n\u2206/\u03b5F=0.5\n\u2206/\u03b5F=1\n\n\u2206/\u03b5F=0\n\u2206/\u03b5F=0.5\n\u2206/\u03b5F=1\n\n6\n\nq=0.5kF\n\n-Im\u03c7 (q,\u03c9)\n\n(0)\n\n3\n\n2\n\n(d)\n\nq=2.5kF\n\n5\n\n(0)\n\n-Im\u03c7 (q,\u03c9)\n\n2\n\n-2\n\nq=0.5kF\n\n-3\n\n4\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n1\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n\u03c9/\u03b5F\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n\u03c9/\u03b5F\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) The gap dependence of the real and the imaginary part of the noninteracting\npolarization function as a function of \u03c9 for wavevectors (a), (c) q = 0.5kF and (b), (d) q = 2.5kF\n\n8\n\n\f0.8\n\n1.4\n\n\u2206=0\n\u2206=50 meV\n\u2206=100 meV\n\n0.7\n\n(a)\n\n0.6\n\n(b)\n\n1.3\n1.25\n\n\u03ba0/\u03ba\n\n0.5\n\n\u03b4\u03b5xc/\u03b5F\n\n\u2206=0\n\u2206=50 meV\n\u2206=100 meV\n\n1.35\n\n0.4\n\n1.2\n\n0.3\n\n1.15\n\n0.2\n\n1.1\n\n0.1\n\n1.05\n\n0\n\n1\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nn-1/2\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nn-1/2\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) (a) Exchange-correlation energy and (b) compressibility as a function of\nn\u22121/2 ( in units of 10\u22126 cm) for various \u2206 value.\nIII.\n\nTHE QP SELF-ENERGY AND THE SPECTRAL FUNCTION\n\nThe generation of QPs in an electron liquid leads to two effects. First it induces a decay\nof a particle losing momentum via inelastic scattering which is determined by the imaginary\npart of self-energy and second is the renormalization of the dispersion relation of the carriers\nwhich is described by the real part of self-energy. Re\u03a3ret (k, \u03c9) is defined as the difference\nbetween the measured carrier energy ~\u03c9, and the energy of free particle, \u03besk = sEk \u2212 EF .\nTo satisfy causality, the real and imaginary parts of self-energy are related by a Hilbert\ntransformation. In this section, we first derive the imaginary and the real part of QP\nself-energies and then calculate some important quantities such as a renormalized Fermi\nvelocity, a spectral function and a band gap renormalization in the presence of a band gap\nvalue. These quantities are related to some important physical properties of both theoretical\nand practical applications like the band structure of ARPES, the energy dissipation rate of\ninjected carriers and the width of the QP spectral function. [61, 62]\nIn the G0 W approximation, the self-energy of gapped graphene is given by (\u03b2 =\n1/(kB T )) [63]:\nZ\nd2 q ss\u2032\n1X\nF (k, k + q)\n\u03a3s (k, i\u03c9n ) = \u2212\n\u03b2 \u2032\n(2\u03c0)2\n\n(4)\n\ns\n\n\u00d7\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\n(0)\n\nW (q, i\u03a9m )Gs\u2032 (k + q, i\u03c9n + i\u03a9m ),\n\nm=\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere W (q, i\u03a9m ) = Vq /\u01eb(q, i\u03a9m ) is the dynamical screened effective interaction and\n\u01eb(q, i\u03a9m ) = 1 \u2212 Vq \u03c7(0) (q, i\u03a9m ) is dynamical dielectric function in RPA. The overlap function\n9\n\n\f\u2032\n\nfor gapped graphene F ss (k, k + q) arises from the graphene band structure is given by [50]\n~2 vF2 k * (k + q) + \u22062\n1\n\u2032\n).\nF ss (k, k + q) = (1 + ss\u2032\n2\nEk Ek+q\n\n(5)\n\n\u2032\n\nIt should be noted that F s=\u2212s (q = 0) = 0. However, in gapless graphene, intraband back\u2032\n\nward scattering should not be allowed, namely F s=s (q = \u22122k, \u2206 = 0) = 0, as well as\n(0)\n\n\u2032\n\nF s=\u2212s (q = 0, \u2206 = 0) = 0. In Eq. (4), Gs (k, i\u03c9) = 1/(i\u03c9 \u2212 \u03besk /~) is the noninteracting\n\nGreen's function. Notice that in typical density of carriers in graphene namely n > 1012 cm\u22122 ,\nthe Fermi temperature is about TF = \u03b5F /kB > 103 K, and we therefore can eliminate temperature parameter in our calculations. To evaluate the zero-temperature retarded self-energy\nline\nres\nline\nwe perform the line-residue decompositions, \u03a3ret\ns (k, \u03c9) = \u03a3s (k, \u03c9) + \u03a3s (k, \u03c9), where \u03a3\n\nis obtained by performing the analytic continuation before summing over the Matsubara\nfrequencies, and \u03a3res is the correction which must be taken into account in the total selfenergy. [57] At zero temperature we have\nX Z d2 q\n\u2032\nline\nVq F ss (k, k + q)\n\u03a3s (k, \u03c9) = \u2212\n2\n(2\u03c0)\n\u2032\nZ \u221es\n1\n1\nd\u03a9\n,\n\u00d7\n\u2212\u221e 2\u03c0 \u01eb(q, i\u03a9) \u03c9 + i\u03a9 \u2212 \u03bes\u2032 (k + q)/~\n\n(6)\n\nand\n\u03a3res\ns (k, \u03c9)\n\n=\n\nXZ\ns\u2032\n\nd2 q\nVq\n\u2032\nF ss (k, k + q)\n2\n(2\u03c0) \u01eb(q, \u03c9 \u2212 \u03bes\u2032 (k + q)/~)\n\n\u00d7 [\u0398(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03bes\u2032 (k + q)/~) \u2212 \u0398(\u2212\u03bes\u2032 (k + q)/~)].\n\n(7)\n\nThe line contribution of the self-energy is purely real. The imaginary part of the self-energy\nres\nres\nhas two contributions where Im\u03a3ret\n+ (k, \u03c9) = Im\u03a3+,intra (k, \u03c9) + Im\u03a3+,inter (k, \u03c9), and real\n\nline\nres\npart of the self energy can be decomposed as Re\u03a3ret\n+ (k, \u03c9) = \u03a3+ (k, \u03c9) + Re\u03a3+,inter (k, \u03c9) +\n\nRe\u03a3res\n+,intra (k, \u03c9).\n\nFor \u03c9 > 0 and fixed q, the RPA decay process represents scattering of an electron from\nmomentum k and energy \u03c9 to k + q and \u03bes\u2032 (k + q), with all energies in Eq. (7) measured\nfrom the Fermi energy of doped graphene. Since the Pauli exclusion principle requires that\nthe final state is unoccupied, it must lie in the conduction band, i.e. s\u2032 = +1. Furthermore\nsince the Fermi sea is initially in its ground state, the QP must lower its energy, i.e. \u03bes\u2032 < \u03c9,\nelectrons decay by going down in energy. For \u03c9 < 0, the self-energy expresses the decay\nof holes inside the Fermi sea, which scatter to a final state, by exciting the Fermi sea.\n10\n\n\fIn this case the final state must be occupied so both band indices are allowed for s\u2032 , and\nenergy conservation requires that holes decay by moving up in energy. Since photoemission\nmeasures the properties of holes produced in the Fermi sea by photo ejection, only \u03c9 < 0 is\nrelevant for this experimental probe.\nIn what follows, we calculate the intraband and interband contributions of self-energy.\nWe have found the intraband term of residue part of self-energy as following for various\nvalues of the frequencies,\n\u03a3res\n+,intra (k, \u03c9\n\n> 0) = C\n\nZ\n\nk+\u03b2\n\ndq\n\nmax(0, kF \u2212k, k\u2212\u03b2)\n\nZ\n\n\u03a3res\n+, intra (k, \u2206\n\n\u2212 EF < ~\u03c9 < 0) = \u2212C\n\n\u03a3res\n+,intra (k, ~\u03c9\n\nZ\n\n< \u2212(\u2206 + EF )) = \u2212C\n\nwhere\n\nZ\n\nmin(~\u03c9+EF , \u03b1+ )\n\ndyf+ (y, q)\n\nmax(EF , \u03b1\u2212 )\n\nk+kF\n\ndq\n\nmax(0, k\u2212kF , \u03b2\u2212k)\n\nk+kF\n\ndq\n\nmax(0, k\u2212kF )\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nmin(EF , \u03b1+ )\n\ndyf+ (y, q)\nmax(0, ~\u03c9+EF , \u03b1\u2212 )\n\nmin(EF , \u03b1+ )\n\ndyf+ (y, q) ,\n\n(8)\n\nmax(0, ~\u03c9+EF , \u03b1\u2212 )\n\n\u00b1(y \u00b1 Ek )2 \u2213 q 2\np\n,\n\u01eb(q, \u03c9 + EF \u2213 y) 4k 2 q 2 \u2212 (y 2 \u2212 Ek2 \u2212 q 2 )2\np\np\n= ~2 vF2 (k \u00b1 q)2 + \u22062 and \u03b2 = ~2 \u03c9 2 + ~2 v 2 kF2 + 2~\u03c9EF.

Note that the real part of self-energy is kc\ndependent.\nNow we are in a situation that can calculate some important physical quantities. The QP\nlifetime or the single-particle relaxation time \u03c4 , is obtained by setting the frequency to the onshell energy in imaginary part of the self-energy, \u03c4s\u22121 = \u0393s (k, \u03besk /~) = ~2 |Im\u03a3ret\ns (k, \u03besk /~)|\n11\n\n\fwhere \u0393s (k, \u03besk /~) is the quantum level broadening of the momentum eigenstate |sk >. This\nquantity is identical with the Fermi's golden rule expression for the sum of the scattering\nrate of a QP and quasihole at wavevector k. [57] From Eqs. 8 and 9, one can conclude that\ntotal contribution of the imaginary part of the retarded self-energy on the energy shell comes\nres\nfrom the intraband term, Im\u03a3ret\n+ (k, \u03bek /~) = Im\u03a3intra (k, \u03bek /~). [63] In the case of gapless\n\ngraphene, scattering rate is a smooth function because of the absence of both plasmon\nemission and interband processes. [64, 65] However, with generating a gap and increasing\nthe amount of it, plasmon emission cause discontinuities in the scattering time, similar to\nconventional 2D electron gas. [66, 67] We have thus two mechanisms for scattering of the QPs.\nThe excitation of electron-hole pairs which is dominant process at long wavelength regions\nand the excitation of plasmon appears in a specific wave vector. As discussed previously [63],\nin clean graphene sheets the inelastic mean free path reduces by increasing the gap whereas\nthe mean free path is large enough in the range of the typical gap values 10-130 meV, and\nthus transport remains in the semi-ballistic regime.\nThe many-body interactions in graphene as a function of doping can be observed by\nARPES which plays as a central role to investigate QP properties such as group velocity\nand lifetime of carriers on the Fermi surface. ARPES is a useful complementary tool which\ncapable of measuring the constant energy surfaces for all partially occupied states and the\nfully occupied band structure. The information of band dispersion and the Fermi surface can\nbe elicited from those data measured in ARPES experiments. The relation of the Green's\nfunction to the single-particle excitation spectrum in the interacting fluid is expressed by\nits spectral function. The spectral function is related to the retarded self-energy by the\nfollowing expression [57]\nAs (k, \u03c9) =\n\n|Im\u03a3ret\n~\ns (k, \u03c9)|\nret\n2\n\u03c0 [~\u03c9 \u2212 \u03bes (k) \u2212 Re\u03b4\u03a3s (k, \u03c9)]2 + [Im\u03a3ret\ns (k, \u03c9)]\n\n(12)\n\nret\nret\nwhere \u03b4\u03a3ret\ns (k, \u03c9) = \u03a3s (k, \u03c9) \u2212 \u03a3s (kF , 0), and then ARPES intensity can be described by\n\nI(k, \u03c9) = A(k, \u03c9)n(\u03c9), where n(\u03c9) is the Fermi-Dirac distribution. The spectral function is\nthe Lorentzian function where Re\u03a3 specifying the location of the peak of the distribution,\nand |Im\u03a3| is the linewidth. The amplitude of the the Lorentzian function is proportional\nto 1/|Im\u03a3|. This quantity is the distribution of energies ~\u03c9, in the system when a QP\nwith momentum k, is added or removed from that. For the noninteracting system we get\nA(0) (k, \u03c9) = \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03be(k)/~). The Fermi liquid theory applies only when the spectral function\n12\n\n\fat the Fermi momentum A(0) (k = kF , \u03c9), behaves as a delta function, and has a broadened\npeak indicating damped QPs at k 6= kF .\n\nTo progress of the interband single particle excitation and plasmon effects on the Im\u03a3ret\ns ,\n\nwe must study the retarded self-energy on the off-shell frequency which is \u03c9 6= \u03besk /~. [49, 68]\nThis quantity gives the scattering rate of a QP with momentum k and kinetic energy ~\u03c9+EF .\nThe scattering rate or the linewidth raising from electron-electron interactions is anisotropic\nand varies significantly via wavevector at a constant energy. The imaginary part of self\nenergy shows the width of the QP spectral function.\nIn Fig. 4 we have shown the absolute value of the imaginary part of the self energy in\nunit of \u03b5F for various gap values. It would be noticed that there is an area of frequency\nis associated to the gap value, 2\u2206 in which no QP could enter in. In this case, there is\na gap in the Im\u03a3 between \u03be\u2212,k=0 and \u03be+,k=0. We see that Im\u03a3+ vanishes as \u03c9 2 for \u03c9\ntends to zero, a universal properties of normal Fermi liquid. Moreover, at large frequency,\nIm\u03a3+ tend towards to \u03c9 linearly. Except from the Dirac point, the conduction band\nIm\u03a3+ peaks broaden because of the dependence on scattering angle of \u03be(k + q). For low\nenergy, only intraband single particle excitation contributes to Im\u03a3 up to EF and then the\ninterband single particle excitation contribution increases sharply about EF . The interband\ncontribution increases with increasing the gap values.\nTo evaluate the scattering rate in interband channel, we have shown Im\u03a3inter(intra) as\na function of frequency in Fig. 5. The intraband contribution of the imaginary part of\nself energy associated to scattering rate of QP in the intraband contribution increases with\nincreasing the gap values while the interband contribution reduces, as we physically expected.\nMoreover, by increasing of the electrons in the conduction band the interband scattering rate\nreduces whereas the intraband scattering contribution increases. The gap value suppresses\nthe scattering rate at \u03c9 = \u2212\u03b5F .\nIn Fig. 6 we have plotted the real part of self-energy in unit of \u03b5F as a function of the\nenergy for various gap values. Notice again that the real part of residue self-energy has a\ngap which is associated the feature calculated in the imaginary part of self-energy. The line\npart of self energy is a continues curve and then we have a jump near to the boundary of gap\nvalues in the Re\u03a3 for gapped graphene. A kink around EF is associated to the interband\nplasmon contribution and it is broaden due to the gap value. This feature affects noticeably\nin the interacting electron density of states.\n13\n\n\f0.14\n\n\u2206/\u03b5F=0\n\u2206/\u03b5F=0.5\n\u2206/\u03b5F=1\nk/kF=0.25\n\n0.15\n\n\u2206/\u03b5F=0\n\u2206/\u03b5F=0.5\n\u2206/\u03b5F=1\n\n0.12\n\n\uf8e6Im \u03a3+(k,\u03c9)/\u03b5F\uf8e6\n\n\uf8e6Im \u03a3+(k,\u03c9)/\u03b5F\uf8e6\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n\n(b)\n\n\u03c9=-0.3\u03b5F\n0.1\n\n0.08\n\n0.06\n\n0.04\n\n0.02\n\n0\n\n0\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n\u03c9/\u03b5F\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\nk/kF\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) The absolute value of the imaginary part of retarded self-energy ( + channel)\nas a function of (a) \u03c9 and (b) k, for the various energy gaps.\n0.06\n\n0.045\n\u2206/\u03b5F=0\n\u2206/\u03b5F=0.5\n\u2206/\u03b5F=1\n\n\uf8e6Im \u03a3inter(k,\u03c9)/\u03b5F\uf8e6\n\n\uf8e6Im \u03a3intra(k,\u03c9)/\u03b5F\uf8e6\n\n0.05\n\n\u2206/\u03b5F=0\n\u2206/\u03b5F=0.5\n\u2206/\u03b5F=1\n\n0.04\n\nk/kF=0.25\n0.04\n\n0.03\n\n0.02\n\n0.01\n\n0.035\n\nk/kF=0.25\n\n0.03\n0.025\n0.02\n0.015\n0.01\n0.005\n0\n\n0\n\n-0.005\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n\u03c9/\u03b5F\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n\u03c9/\u03b5F\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\nFIG. 5: (Color online) (a) The intraband and (b) the interband contributions of the imaginary\npart of self-energy ( + channel) as a function of \u03c9 for the various energy gaps at k = 0.25kF .\n\nAs discussed before [49, 68] in a zero temperature and disorder free gapless graphene, the\npeaks of the spectral function correspond to the nearly solutions of Dyson's equation in which\nthe quasiparticle excitation energies are obtained by E = \u03be+ + Re\u03b4\u03a3ret\n+ .

The s = +1 and \u22121 peaks in Im\u03a3s in Figs. 4 and 8\nseparate at finite k because of chirality factors which emphasize k and q in nearly parallel\ndirections for conduction band and k and q in nearly opposite directions for valance band\nstates. Consequently, at finite \u2206, the QP peak of A\u2212 (k, \u03c9) which is broaden shifts toward\nthe left in the opposite behavior of A+ (k, \u03c9). These feature have significant effects in the\ninteracting electron density of states.\nIt is essential to note that the satellite band which is theoretically predicted [49] for gapless\ngarphene has not been seen in experiments.

A consequence of the interaction is a Fermi velocity renormalization from the backflow of the fluid around a moving particle. The density of states at\nthe Fermi energy is also changed. The QP energy measured from the chemical potential of\ninteracting system \u03b4\u03b5QP\nsk , can be calculated by solving self consistently the Dyson equation\nret\n\u03b4\u03b5QP\nsk = \u03besk +Re[\u03b4\u03a3s (k, \u03c9)]|\u03c9=\u03b4\u03b5QP /~.[57] In the isotropic systems the QP energy, depends on\nsk\n\nQP\n\u2217\nthe magnitude of k. Expanding \u03b4\u03b5QP\nsk to first order in k \u2212kF we can write \u03b4\u03b5sk \u2243 ~vs (k \u2212kF )\n\nwhich effectively defines the renormalized velocity as ~vs\u2217 = d\u03b4\u03b5QP\nsk /dk|k=kF . From the Dyson\n16\n\n\fequation we can calculated the renormalized Fermi velocity as [63, 69, 70]\nvs\u2217\n\u03b5F EF\u22121 + (~vs )\u22121 \u2202k Re[\u03b4\u03a3ret\ns (k, \u03c9)]|\u03c9=0,k=kF\n=\n,\n\u22121\nret\nvs\n1 \u2212 ~ \u2202\u03c9 Re[\u03b4\u03a3s (k, \u03c9)]|\u03c9=0,k=kF\n\n(13)\n\nwhere vs = svF . It is found before [63, 69, 70, 71, 72] that electron-electron interaction\nincreases the renormalized Fermi velocity in gapless graphene sheets which this behavior is\nin contrast to conventional 2DES. [66, 73]\nFig. 9 shows the renormalized Fermi velocity in unit of the bare Fermi velocity as a\nfunction of band gap for various carrier densities. The renormalized Fermi velocity decreasing\nwith increasing the gap value. v \u2217 is density independent after \u2206 = 0.8\u03b5F which is in good\nagreement with recent experiment observation. [24, 25]\nFinally we calculated a band gap renormalization (BGR). [74, 75, 76, 77] The BGR\nfor conductance band is given by the QP self-energy at the band edge, namely BGR =\nRe\u03a3ret\n+ (k = 0, \u03c9 = (\u2206 \u2212 EF )/~). Fig. 10 shows the BGR for the various gap values as a\nfunction of the electron density. The BGR decreases by increasing of the electron density\nand in the small energy gap values, it is less density dependent respect to large energy\ngap values. In gapless case, we have obtained a induced band gap or kink due to manybody electron-electron interactions and it tends to a constant with increasing the electron\ndensity. [49, 68, 71, 72] This feature is in agreement with the results obtained within ab intio\nDFT calculation.

We have performed a systematic study is based on the many-body\nG0 W approach that is established upon the random-phase-approximation and on graphene's\nmassive Dirac equation continuum model. We have carried out extensive calculations of both\nthe real and the imaginary part of the QP self-energy and discussed about the interband\nand intraband contributions in the scattering process in the presence of gap value. We have\nalso presented results for the effective velocity and for the band gap renormalization over a\nwide range of coupling strength. Accordingly, we have critically examined the merits of the\ngap values in dynamical QP properties.\nMost feature of mass generating in graphene is the washing out of the plasmaron peak in\nthe spectral weight. Increasing of the gap value makes density independent behavior of the\nrenormalized Fermi velocity. We have shown that the band gap renormalization in gapped\ngraphene decreases by increasing the carrier density at large \u2206. This is in contrast with\nthe gapless case in which many body electron-plasmon interactions induce a very small gap\nin band structure. These distinct features of the massive Dirac's Fermions are related to\nmixing of the chiralities and reduce of the interband transitions in graphene sheets.\nAcknowledgment\nR.
