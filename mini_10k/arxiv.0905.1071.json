Romanova2\n\narXiv:0905.1071v1 [astro-ph.HE] 7 May 2009\n\nDraft version October 26, 2018\n\nABSTRACT\nWe discuss three modes of oscillation of accretion disks around rotating magnetized neutron stars\nwhich may explain the separations of the kilo-Hertz -periodic oscillations (QPO) seen in low mass Xray binaries. The existence of these compressible, non-barotropic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes\nrequires that there be a maximum in the angular velocity \u03a9\u03c6 (r) of the accreting material larger than\nthe angular velocity of the star \u03a9\u2217 , and that the fluid is in approximately circular motion near this\nmaximum rather than moving rapidly towards the star or out of the disk plane into funnel flows. Our\nMHD simulations show this type of flow and \u03a9\u03c6 (r) profile. The first mode is a Rossby wave instability\n(RWI) mode which is radially trapped in the vicinity of the maximum of a key function g(r)F (r) at rR .\nThe real part of the angular frequency of the mode is \u03c9r = m\u03a9\u03c6 (rR ), where m = 1, 2... is the azimuthal\nmode number. The second mode, is a mode driven by the rotating, non-axisymmetric component of\nthe star's magnetic field. It has an angular frequency equal to the star's angular rotation rate \u03a9\u2217 . This\nmode is strongly excited near the radius of the Lindblad resonance which is slightly outside of rR . The\nthird mode arises naturally from the interaction of flow perturbation with the rotating non-axisymmetric\ncomponent of the star's magnetic field. It has an angular frequency \u03a9\u2217 /2. We suggest that the first\nmode with m = 1 is associated with the upper QPO frequency, \u03bdu ; that the nonlinear interaction of the\nfirst and second modes gives the lower QPO frequency, \u03bdl = \u03bdu \u2212 \u03bd\u2217 ; and that the nonlinear interaction\nof the first and third modes gives the lower QPO frequency \u03bdl = \u03bdu \u2212 \u03bd\u2217 /2, where \u03bd\u2217 = \u03a9\u2217 /2\u03c0.\n\nSubject headings: keywords: accretion, accretion disks - stars: neutron - X-rays: binaries -\nmagnetohydrodynamics - Instabilities - Waves\n\nHelmholtz type instabilities in the vicinity of the magnetopause. Recently, Fu and Lai (2009) have done a systematic analysis of short wavelength modes of a disk for cases\nwhere the magnetic field is not dynamically important.\nThe present work is a continuation of the study of\nLovelace and Romanova (2007; hereafter LR07) of the\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stability of the compressible, non-barotropic stability of the boundary between an\naccretion disk and the magnetosphere of a rotating magnetized star for conditions where \u03a9\u03c6 , Bz , and \u03c1 vary\nsmoothly with radial distance but are independent of z,\nand where the magnetic field is dynamically important.\nThe radial profiles of these quantities are known for different conditions from MHD simulations (Romanova et\nal. 2002; Long, Romanova, & Lovelace 2005; Romanova,\nKulkarni, & Lovelace 2008; Kulkarni & Romanova 2008).\nThe recent MHD studies (Romanova et al. 2008; Kulkarni\n& Romanova 2008) discovered conditions where a global\nRayleigh-Tayor instability occurs and changes the nature\nof the accretion flow from a regular funnel flow pattern\nto a chaotic flow of plasma fingers. The present work is\nconcerned with a radially localized instablity of a globally\nstable approximately axisymmetric flow. Of particular importance to the present work is that \u03a9\u03c6 (r) is observed to go\nthrough a maximum significantly larger than the angular\nrotation rate of the star \u03a9\u2217 = 2\u03c0\u03bd\u2217 . The importance of the\nmaximum of \u03a9\u03c6 (r) for models of QPOs was discussed earlier by Alpar and Psaltis (2005). LR07 showed that there\nwas a Rossby wave instability (RWI) or unstable corotation mode with azimuthal mode number m = 1, 2.. radially\ntrapped at rR near the maximum of \u03a9\u03c6 (r). It was sug-\n\n1. introduction\n\nLow mass X-ray binaries often display twin kilo-Hertz\nquasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in their X-ray emissions\n(van der Klis 2006; Zhang et al. 2006). A wide variety of\ndifferent models have been proposed to explain the origin and correlations of the different QPOs. These include\nthe beat frequency model (Miller, Lamb, & Psaltis 1998;\nLamb & Miller 2001; Lamb & Miller 2003), the relativistic\nprecession model (Stella & Vietri 1999), the Alfv\u00e9n wave\nmodel (Zhang 2004), and warped disk models (Shirakawa\n& Lai 2002; Kato 2004).\nA puzzling aspect of the some of the twin QPO sources\nconsidered in this work is that the difference between\nthe upper \u03bdu and lower \u03bdl QPO frequencies is roughly\neither the spin frequency of the star \u03bd\u2217 (3 cases where\n\u03bd\u2217 = 270, 330, & 363 Hz) or one-half this frequency, \u03bd\u2217 /2\n(4 cases where \u03bd\u2217 = 401, 524, 581, & 619 Hz), for the\ncases where \u03bd\u2217 is known, even though \u03bdu and \u03bdl vary significantly (see, e.g., Zhang et al. 2006). A further type\nof behavior appears in the source Cir X-1 (Boutloukos et\nal. 2006), but this is not considered here. The cases where\n\u03bdu \u2212\u03bdl \u2248 \u03bd\u2217 may be explained by the beat frequency model\n(Miller et al. 1998), but the explanation of the cases where\n\u03bdu \u2212 \u03bdl \u2248 \u03bd\u2217 /2 is obscure.\nLi and Narayan (2004) analyzed the stability of an incompressible rotating flow where the radial profiles of the\nplasma angular rotation rate \u03a9\u03c6 , the magnetic field Bz ,\nand the density \u03c1 change sharply at the magnetopause radius but are independent of z. The magnetic field was\ndynamically important in the sense that \u03c1u2 \u223c B2 /4\u03c0\nwith u = r\u03a9\u03c6 \u03c6\u0302 .

The theory of the RWI was developed by\nLovelace et al. (1999) and Li et al. (2000) for accretion\ndisks and earlier by Lovelace & Hohlfeld (1978) for disk\ngalaxies. Hydrodynamic simulations of the RWI instability in disks were done by Li et al. (2001), while Sellwood\n& Kahn (1991) used N \u2212body simulations to study the\ninstability in galaxies. The instability has important role\nin the accretion-ejection instability of disks discussed by\nTagger and collaborators (e.g., Tagger & Varni\u00e8re 2006;\nTagger & Pellat 1999).\nSection 2.1 develops the general compressible, nonbarotropic MHD equations for free perturbations an axisymmetric equilibrium flow with no z\u2212dependence. Section 2.2 treats the driven perturbations due to the rotating non-axisymmetric component of the star's magnetic field. Section 2.3 treats the driven-modulated perturbations which result from the interaction of the nonaxisymmetric field of the star and the flow perturbation.\nSection 3 develops a detailed model of the axisymmetric\nflow/field equilibrium based on results from MHD simulations. Section 4 discusses the results obtained applying\nthe theory of \u00a72 to the model of \u00a73. Section 4.1 treats the\nfree perturbations, \u00a74.2 the driven perturbations, and \u00a74.3\nthe driven-modulated perturbations.

Earlier work by Lovelace and Hohlfeld\n(1978), Lovelace et al. (1999), and Li et al.

Driven Perturbations\nThe influence of a small non-axisymmetric component\nof the stellar magnetic field can be studied by including in\nequation (1b) the small force due to this non-axisymmetry.\nAt a given radial distance, the total vertical magnetic field\nB = B v + B i consists of the vacuum component B v due to\ncurrent flow inside the star and the induced field B i due\nto the current flow in the plasma outside the star. The\nvacuum field field has the general form\nB v = B v0 (r) + \u2206B v (r, \u03c6, t) ,\nv\nv1\n\u2206B = B (r) exp(i\u03c6\u2212i\u03a9\u2217 t)+B v2 (r) exp(2i\u03c6\u2212i\u03a9\u2217 t)+... ,\n(21)\nwhere B v0 is the axisymmetric component, B v1 \u226a B v0\nis the quadrupole component, and B v2 \u226a B v0 is the octupole component. The quadrupole term can represent\na non-centered but aligned dipole field in the star.\n\b The\ntotal magnetic force or acceleration is F = \u2212\u2207 [hBi +\n\u2206B v ]2 /(8\u03c0\u03c1), (because (B * \u2207)B=0), where hBi = hB i +\nB v i and where the average is over \u03c6. Linearization gives\n\u03b4F = \u2212\u2207[hBi\u2206B v (r, \u03c6, t)]/(4\u03c0\u03c1). Thus we have\n(\u03b4Fr , \u03b4F\u03c6 ) = (\u03b4Fr0 , \u03b4F\u03c60 ) exp(im\u03c6 \u2212 i\u03a9\u2217 t) ,\n(22)\nwhere m = 1 or 2 and \u03a9\u2217 is the angular rotation rate of the\nstar.

This modulation comes about naturally by including the magnetic field perturbation\n\u03b4B in the magnetic\n\b\nforce F. That is, F = \u2212\u2207 [hBi + \u03b4B + \u2206B v ]2 /(8\u03c0\u03c1).\nm\nLinearization\n\u0002\n\u0003 of this force gives a contribution F =\nv\n\u2212\u2207 \u03b4B\u2206B /(4\u03c0\u03c1). The equations of \u00a72.1 can be used\nto derive an exact formula relating \u03b4B to \u03a8, but here we\nuse a simplified formula for one of the dominant terms,\n\u03b4B = B\u03a8(DL2\u2217 )\u22121 , in order to limit the complexity of\nthe equations. An equation for the driven modulated perturbations is then obtained by the replacement in equation (23) of \u03b4F \u2192 \u03b4Fm = \u03a8\u2217 \u03b4F/(DL2\u2217 ), where \u03b4F is still\ngiven by equation (22) and is a known function determined\nby \u2206B v . The use of \u03a8\u2217 rather than \u03a8 is required due\nto our assumed dependence of \u03b4F in equation (22). For\nthe driven-modulated perturbations we obtain in place of\nequation (25)\nb \u00011/2 \u001a \u0014\u0012 b \u22121/2 \u0013\u2217 \u0015\u001b\nr D\nD\n\u03c6\n\u2032\u2032 b\nc\n\u03c6 \u2212 U (r)\u03c6 = i\n\u03b4F\n, (26)\n\u2207* M*\n2\nd\nr\u03c1L\n\u2206\u03c9\n\u2217\nwhere we have used the fact that \u03a8 = (D)1/2 \u03c6. The hats\nover different quantities indicates that they are now operators with \u03c9 \u2192 i(\u2202/\u2202t) and k\u03c6 \u2192 \u2212i(\u2202/\u2202\u03c6). The matrix\nM allows us to write equation (24) as H = M * \u03b4F.\nEquation (26) is a linear equation for \u03c6 so that in general\n\u03c6 = \u03c60 exp(\u2212i\u03c9t)+\u03c61 exp(i\u03c6\u2212i\u03c9t)+\u03c62 exp(2i\u03c6\u2212i\u03c9t)+.. ,\n(27)\nwhere \u03c9 is real but undetermined at this point. Clearly,\nthe time and angle dependence on both sides of equation\n(26) must match.\nFor the case where there is a small quadrupole field component \u2206B = B v1 exp(i\u03c6 \u2212 i\u03c9t), equation (26) implies\n\u0002\n\u0003\n(m = 0),\n\u03c6\u2032\u20320 \u2212 U0,\u03c9 (r)\u03c60 = Op(\u03c6\u22171 ) 0,\u03c9\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03c6\u2032\u20321 \u2212 U1,\u03c9 (r)\u03c61 = Op(\u03c6\u22170 ) 1,\u03c9 (m = 1),\n(28)\n\nwhere Op stands for the linear operator on \u03c6\u2217 on the righthand side of equation (26) and the new subscripts indicate\nthe m value and the \u03c9 value. Here, we necessarily have\n\u03a9\u2217\n\u03c9=\n,\n(29)\n2\nas found earlier by LR07.\nFor the case where there is a small octupole field component \u2206B = B v2 exp(2i\u03c6 \u2212 i\u03c9t), equation (26) implies\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03c6\u2032\u20321 \u2212 U1,\u03c9 (r)\u03c61 = Op(\u03c6\u22171 ) 1,\u03c9 ,\n(30)\n\nwhere we again have \u03c9 = \u03a9\u2217 /2.\nIn contrast with the case of driven perturbations of \u00a72.2,\nequation (26) is linear in \u03c6 so that its magnitude is indeterminate. Further study is needed to determine the\nmagnitude of \u03c6 in this case. One possibility is to generalize equation (26) to include on the right-hand-side of\nthe equation the inhomogeneous driving force \u221d \u03b4F as\n\n\u0001\nwell the nonlinear force \u03b4Fnl = \u2212\u2207 |\u03b4B|2 /(8\u03c0\u03c1). Owing to the nonlinearity the driving force \u03b4F at frequency\n\u03a9\u2217 can generate the 1/2 subharmonic oscillations of \u03c6 at\nthe frequency \u03a9\u2217 /2 described by equation (26). Analogous\nsubharmonic generation is known in similar systems (e.g.,\nMinorsky 1974).\n3. model of equilibrium\n\nFigure 2 shows sample measured profiles of the midplane\naxial magnetic field (B), the azimuthal frequency of the\ndisk matter [\u03bd\u03c6 = v\u03c6 /(2\u03c0r)] and its density (\u03c1) from MHD\nsimulations by Romanova, Kulkarni, & Lovelace (2008)\nfor globally stable case. The simulations were three dimensional for an approximately axisymmetric case. These\nprofiles motivate our choice of analytic functions to represent these quantities.\nThe fact that \u03bd\u03c6 (r) decreases as r decreases close to\nthe star is due to magnetic braking. A small twist of the\nstar's magnetic field transports angular momentum of the\ndisk matter to the star. That is, for z > 0 there is a vertical flux of angular momentum \u2212rB\u03c6 Bz /(4\u03c0) > 0 with\n|B\u03c6 | \u226a |Bz | which transports the disk angular momentum to the star along the star's field lines (see Figure 1).\nThis loss of angular momentum implies a mass accretion\nrate of the disk (outside of the region of the funnel flow)\nof \u1e40d = \u2212r2 (B\u03c6 )h Bz /(dl/dr) (= const) in the absence\nof viscosity (see Lovelace, Romanova, & Newman 1994),\nwhere the h\u2212subscript indicates evaluation at the top surface of the disk, l = ru\u03c6 is the specific angular momentum,\nand dl/dr is positive for the considered profiles. The turbulent viscosity due to the magnetorotational instability\n(MRI) is absent in the region of the disk where cA > cs\nand/or d\u03a9\u03c6 /dr > 0 (Balbus & Hawley 1998).

The vertical scale is\nfor the azimuthal frequency of the disk matter; the star's frequency\nis \u03bd\u2217 = 300 Hz. The scalings of Bz and \u03c1 is arbitrary.\n\nWe assume a pseudo-Newtonian gravitational potential\n\u03a6g = \u2212GM\u2217 /(r \u2212 rS ), where M\u2217 is the star's mass and\nrS \u2261 2GM\u2217 /c2 = 4.14 \u00d7 105 cm for a 1.4M\u2299 star. The\n\n\f6\nangular velocity of a single paraticle is \u03a9K = 2\u03c0\u03bdK =\n{GM\u2217 /[r(r \u2212 rS )2 ]}1/2 for r \u2265 3rS .

Here, \u03bd\u2217\nis the rotation frequency of the star and f (r) \u2261 exp[\u2212(r \u2212\nr0 )/\u2206] with r0 the standoff distance of the boundary layer\nand \u2206 is its thickness. The azimuthal velocity of the matter is v\u03c6 = 2\u03c0r\u03bd\u03c60 . Both r0 and \u2206 are expected to depend\non the accretion rate and the star's magnetic field.\n\n1400\n\n\u03bdK\n\n1200\n\nback and obtain the correction \u03b4\u03bd\u03c6 to the azimuthal frequency needed to account for the pressure gradient; that\nis, 2\u03c1r(2\u03c0)2 \u03bd\u03c60 \u03b4\u03bd\u03c6 = dp/dr so that the actual rotation\nfrequency is \u03bd\u03c6 = \u03bd\u03c60 + \u03b4\u03bd\u03c6 .

The\nvalue of the magnetic field at r/rS = 6 is arbitrary, but\nhere it is chosen so that cA < cs which allows the MRI to\ngrow which in turn gives rise to a turbulent viscosity in the\ndisk (Balbus & Hawley 1998). The maximum of the disk\nfrequency \u03bd\u03c6 is about 1149(4rS /r0 )1.68 Hz for \u2206/rS = 0.1,\nand it occurs at a distance about 0.26rS larger than r0 . For\n\u2206/rS = 0.2, the maximum of \u03bd\u03c6 is somewhat smaller and\nit occurs at a distance about 0.4rS larger than r0 .\n\n2\n\n\u03bd\u03c6\n\nBz\n\n1000\n\n\u03bdr\n\n800\n600\n\nrR\n\ncA\n\n\u03c1\n\nu\u03c6\n\n1\n\n400\n200\n0\n\n3\n\n4\n\nr/rS\n\n5\n\n6\n\nFig. 3.- Radial profiles of the magnetic field (Bz ), the azimuthal\nfrequency [\u03bd\u03c6 = v\u03c6 /(2\u03c0r)], the Keplerian frequency (\u03bdK ), and the\ndensity \u03c1 of the model discussed in \u00a73.

For this we use Maple V. 12 where we define about 40 different functions of R = r/rS , for example, \u03c1(R), \u03bd\u03c6 (R), \u03bdr (R), \u2206\u03c9(R), B(R), .., U (R). Some of\nthe functions, for example, U , are complex for complex\n\u03c9. The axisymmetric (m = 0) perturbation are found to\nbe stable if the width of the boundary layer is not too\nnarrow; that is, there is stability for \u2206/rS & 0.02. In\nthe following we consider the possible instability of modes\nwith m = 1, 2, ....\n4.1. Free Perturbations\nFigure 5 shows the radial dependence of the real part\nof the key function g(r)F (r) for the same conditions as\nFigure 3. This function has a maximum at rR = 3.92rS\nindicated by the vertical arrow marked corotation resonance. The function changes sign at rL = 4.07rS which\nis a Lindblad resonance where F (and D) change signs.\nThe maximum of R[g(r)F (r)] appears to be a general feature for profiles similar to those in Figure 2. The dependence can be traced to the dependence of D(r) (equation 10b). For r decreasing significantly below r0 , the\n\n\f7\nterm \u2212(dp\u2217 /dr)/(\u03c1L\u2217 ) in D becomes increasingly negative. This is due to the radial dependence of the magnetic\npressure and the small density. Note L\u2217 is negative in this\nregion. On the other hand for r increasing from \u223c r0 , the\npositive contribution of \u03a92r begins to dominate. The combination of these dependences gives a R[g(r)F (r)] profile\nwith a maximum at a distance inside the Lindblad resonance as shown in Figure 5.\n\n1\n\ndius r/rS = 3.83 of the maximum of R[g(r)F (r)]. From\nequation (35) we find \u03bdi = 120 Hz. For \u2206 increasing from\n0.2, we find that \u03bdr and rR continue to decrease gradually\nand \u03bdi also decreases.\n\n300\n\nR(U)\n\n200\n100\n0\n\ncorotation\nresonance\n\nrR R( g F )\n\n0\n\nrL\n\n3\n\n4\n\nrR\n\n-100\n\n-200\n\nLindblad\nresonance\n\nr/rS\n\n0\n\n-100\n\n-300\n\n-1\n\n100\n\n5\n\n6\n\nFig. 5.- Radial dependence of the real part of the key function\ngF for for the same conditions as for Figure 3. The imaginary part\nof the function is small compared with the real part. The function\nhas only a weak dependence on \u03c9 which for this plot is \u03c9 \u2248 850+i89\nHz. We find maximum instability for R[\u2206\u03c9(r)] = 0 at the radial\nlocation of the maximum of R(gF ) indicated by the vertical arrow.\nThe other arrow shows a Lindblad resonance where R(F ) changes\nsign. The vertical scale is arbitrary.\n\nFigure 6 shows the real part of the effective potential\nU (r) for the same case as Figure 5. The real part of the\nfrequency is chosen to give R[\u2206\u03c9(r)] = 0 at rR /rS = 3.92\nof the maximum of R[g(r)F (r)] because this give the maximum growth rate. For m = 1 this gives \u03bdr = \u03c9r /2\u03c0 = 850\nHz. Clearly this frequency must be larger than rotation\nfrequency of the star \u03bd\u2217 .\nThe depth of the potential well shown in Figure 6 increases as the imaginary part of the frequency \u03c9i = I(\u03c9) >\n0 (the growth rate) decreases.\nR r We\u0001 use a WKBJ treatment\n\u22121/2\nwith \u03c6 \u221d k\nexp \u00b1 i drk and k = [\u2212R(U )]1/2 .\nThe imaginary part of U is small compared with the real\npart.

The largest growth rate \u03c9i corresponds to n = 0\nand for the case of Figure 6 with m = 1 this gives\n\u03bdi = \u03c9i /2\u03c0 = 89 Hz so that \u03c9i /\u03c9r \u2248 10%. For modes\nwith m \u2265 2 also grow with similar \u03c9i /\u03c9r values but as\ndiscussed below these modes do not give time variations\nin the total flux from the source.\nFor a more gradual boundary layer with \u2206 = 0.2 and\nm = 1, we find R[\u2206\u03c9(r)] = 0 for \u03bdr = 750 Hz at the ra-\n\n-200\n3.9\n\n3.8\n\n3\n\n4\n\nr/rS\n\n5\n\n4\n\n6\n\nFig. 6.- Radial dependence of the real part of the effective poten2 ) for the same conditions as for Figure\ntial R[U (r)] (multiplied by rS\n5. The imaginary part of U is much smaller than the real part.\n\nOwing to the perturbation, the surface temperature of\nthe disk is\n\u0002\nT (r, \u03c6, t) = T0 + R \u03b4T1 exp(i\u03c6 \u2212 i\u03c91 t)\n\u0003\n+ \u03b4T2 (r) exp(2i\u03c6 \u2212 i\u03c92 t) + . . ,\n(36)\n\nwhere T0 (r) is the unperturbed temperature, \u03b4T1,2 (r) \u226a\nT0 are the amplitudes of the m = 1, 2 corotation modes,\nand \u03c91,2 are their frequencies. We neglect the difference\nbetween the midplane and the surface temperature of the\ndisk. The corresponding flux density from\n\u0002 the disk surface is proportional to S(r, \u03c6, t) \u223c T\u000304 + R 4T03 \u03b4T1 exp(i\u03c6\u2212\ni\u03c91 t) + 4T03 \u03b4T2 exp(2i\u03c6\n\u2212 i\u03c92 t) + .. . The total flux for a\nR\nface-on disk, L \u223c rdrd\u03c6S, is independent of time: the\n\u03c6\u2212integration annihilates the terms dependent on \u03c6. For\na more general disk orientation, with the disk angular momentum tilted say towards the line of sight by an angle \u03b9,\nthe Doppler effect due to the disk rotation gives a boost\nto the frequency for say \u03c6 = 0 and a decrement for \u03c6 = \u03c0.\nThis corresponds to multiplying S by the Doppler factor\nD(r, \u03c6) \u2261 [1 + \u03b5(r) cos(\u03c6)]4 \u2248 1 + 4\u03b5 cos(\u03c6), where \u03b5 =\n[v\u03c6 (r)/c] sin(\u03b9) and \u03b52 \u226a 1. For the case of Figure 6 where\nr = 3.92rs , v\u03c6 /c = 0.289. Consequently,\nthere is a contriR\nbution\u0002 Rto the source flux \u03b4L \u223c \u0003rdrd\u03c6D(r, \u03c6)S(r, \u03c6, t) \u223c\n16\u03c0R rdrT03 \u03b5\u03b4T1 (r) exp(\u2212i\u03c91 t) . We interpret this frequency as the upper frequency component of the twin\nQPOs as argued earlier by LR07. Note that the higher\norder terms \u03b4T2 , \u03b4T3 , ... give no contribution to the total\nflux due to the \u03c6\u2212integration.\n4.2. Driven Perturbations\n\nHere we consider the driven perturbations of the flow\nwhich result from a quadrupole or octupole component\nof the star's magnetic field as discussed in \u00a72.2. Inspection of equation (25) reveals that the radial locations of\nthe Lindblad resonances where D (or D) vanishes are very\nimportant for excitation of the flow (LR07). At such a\n\n\f8\nresonance the right-hand-side equation (25) - the driving\n\u2032\nterm - is proportional to D (D)\u22123/2 .\nWe first consider the quadrupole field case B v1 where\nm = 1 for \u03bdr = \u03c9r /2\u03c0 = 300 Hz and \u03c9i = 0. We find\nthat D goes through zero at one radius, rL = 4.07rS for\nthis case. Near this radius we find D \u2248 a(x \u2212 bx2 ), where\nx \u2261 (r \u2212 rL )/rL and a, b > 0 are constants. We are interested as explained below to determine the amplitude of\nthis driven mode near the vicinity of the corotation mode\nat rR = 3.92rS . For this purpose we develop an approximate solution to equation (25) for x2 \u226a 1 by retaining only\nthe most singular term in the effective potential which is\n\u00012\n\u2032\nU \u2248 (3/4) D /D . The right-hand side of the equation\n\u2032\ncan be approximated as KD (D)\u22123/2 , where K \u221d B v1 .\nThus equation (25) simplifies to\n\n2\n\nd2 \u03c6\nK(1 \u2212 2bx)\n,\n\u2212 \u03ba2 \u03c6 =\ndx2\n(x \u2212 bx2 )3/2\n2\n\nThe associated flux density is\n\u0002\n\u0003\nT04 + 4T03 R \u03b4T1f exp(i\u03c6 \u2212 i\u03c91 t) + \u03b4T2d exp(2i\u03c6 \u2212 i\u03a9\u2217 t)\n\b\n+6T02 R \u03b4T1f \u03b4T2d\u2217 exp[\u2212i\u03c6 \u2212 i(\u03c91 \u2212 \u03a9\u2217 )t] + ... . (42)\n\nIn this case we have just two frequency components: The\nfirst is at the frequency \u03c91 of the unstable free perturbation as a result of the Doppler boost acting on\nthe term \u03b4T1f exp(i\u03c6 \u2212 i\u03c91 t). The second is at the frequency \u03c91 \u2212 \u03a9\u2217 as a result of the Doppler boost acting on the term \u03b4T1f \u03b4T2d\u2217 exp[\u2212i\u03c6 \u2212 i(\u03c91 \u2212 \u03a9\u2217 )t]. The\nDoppler boost acting on the remaining term in equation\n(39), \u03b4T2d exp(2i\u03c6 \u2212 i\u03a9\u2217 t), causes no variation in the total\nflux.\n\n10 5\n\n(37)\n\nU\n\n2\n\nwhere \u03ba = (3/4)[(1 \u2212 2bx)/(x \u2212 bx )] . The inhomogeneous solution to this equation for x2 \u226a 1 is\nK\n\u03c6= \u221a .\n(38)\n3 x\nAlthough \u03c6 diverges at x = 0, note that \u03a8 = \u03b4p\u2217 /\u03c1 is a\nconstant. For \u2212x increasing we find that the dependence\nof \u03ba2 changes from \u223c (3/4)x\u22122 to \u03ba2 = \u03ba20 \u2248 38. The\nsmall value of \u03ba20 means that driven mode has a significant amplitude at the distance rR where the free mode is\nexcited.\nWith both the free perturbation and the quadrupole\ndriven perturbation present we have\n\u0002\nT (r, \u03c6, t) = T0 + R \u03b4T1f (r) exp(i\u03c6 \u2212 i\u03c91 t)\n\u0003\n+ \u03b4T1d (r) exp(i\u03c6 \u2212 i\u03a9\u2217 t) .\n(39)\nThe associated flux density S \u223c T 4 is\n\u0002\n\u0003\nT04 + 4T03 R \u03b4T1f exp(i\u03c6 \u2212 i\u03c91 t) + \u03b4T1d exp(i\u03c6 \u2212 i\u03a9\u2217 t)\n\b\n(40)\n+6T02 R \u03b4T1f \u03b4T1d\u2217 exp[\u2212i(\u03c91 \u2212 \u03a9\u2217 )t] + ...,\n\nwhere the ellipsis denotes terms of the form O[exp(\u00b12i\u03c6)]\nand O[exp(\u00b14i\u03c6)] which do not cause variations in the total flux. It follows from this equation that there are three\nQPO components for a generally oriented disk. Two of the\ncomponents arise from the above-mentioned Doppler boost\nacting first on the term \u03b4T1f exp(i\u03c6 \u2212 i\u03c91 t), which gives a\nfrequency \u03c91 component in the total flux, and second on\nthe term \u03b4T1d exp(i\u03c6 \u2212 i\u03a9\u2217 t), which gives a frequency \u03a9\u2217\n(the star's rotation frequency) in the total flux. The third\ncomponent arises for the final term in equation (37) and\nhas a frequency \u03c91 \u2212 \u03a9\u2217 . The component at \u03a9\u2217 is however usually absent (van der Klis 2006) so that we do not\nconsider this case further.\nFor the case of an octupole field component B v2 where\nm = 2 we find two Lindblad resonances for \u03c9r /2\u03c0 =\n\u03a9\u2217 /2\u03c0 = 300 Hz and \u03c9i = 0 as shown in Figure 7. One resonance is at rLi /rS = 4.11 and the other at rLo /rS = 4.28.\nThe driven motion at rLi is important here because this\nis close to the radius of the unstable free perturbation rR .\nFor this case\n\u0002\nT (r, \u03c6, t) = T0 + R \u03b4T1f (r) exp(i\u03c6 \u2212 i\u03c91 t)\n\u0003\n+ \u03b4T2d (r) exp(2i\u03c6 \u2212 i\u03a9\u2217 t) .\n(41)\n\n0\nLindblad\nresonances\n\nD\n5\n\n-10\n\n3.9\n\n4\n\n4.1\n\n4.2\n\nr/rS\n\n4.3\n\n4.4\n\nFig. 7.- Radial dependence of the Lindblad factor D (arbi2 ) for\ntrary scale) and the effective potential U (multiplied by rS\n\u03c9r /2\u03c0 = 300 Hz, \u03c9i = 0, and m = 2 and other conditions the same\nas in Figure 5.\n\n4.3. Driven Modulated Perturbations\nHere we consider the driven modulated perturbations of\nthe flow which result from the octupole component of the\nstar's magnetic field B v2 discussed in \u00a72.3. Two Lindblad\nresonances are again found at radii similar to the case of\nFigure 7. The inner radius rLi is important here because it\nis close to the radius rR of the unstable free perturbation.\nFor the driven modulated octupole case we have\n\b\nT (r, \u03c6, t) = T0 + R \u03b4T1f (r) exp(i\u03c6 \u2212 i\u03c91 t)\n+ \u03b4T2dm (r) exp[2i\u03c6 \u2212 i(\u03a9\u2217 /2)t] .\n(43)\nThe associated flux density is\n\u0003\n\b\nT04 + 4T03R \u03b4T1f exp(i\u03c6\u2212 i\u03c91 t)+ \u03b4T2dm exp[2i\u03c6\u2212 i(\u03a9\u2217 /2)t)\n\b\n+6T02 R \u03b4T1f \u03b4T2dm\u2217 exp[\u2212i\u03c6 \u2212 i(\u03c91 \u2212 \u03a9\u2217 /2)t] + ... . (44)\n\nIn this case we again have just two frequency components: The first is at the frequency \u03c91 of the unstable\nfree perturbation as a result of the Doppler boost acting on the term \u03b4T1f exp(i\u03c6 \u2212 i\u03c91 t). The second is at the\nfrequency \u03c91 \u2212 \u03a9\u2217 /2 as a result of the Doppler boost acting on the term \u03b4T1f \u03b4T2dm\u2217 exp[\u2212i\u03c6 \u2212 i(\u03c91 \u2212 \u03a9\u2217 /2)t]. The\nDoppler boost acting on the remaining term in equation\n(39), \u03b4T2dm exp[2i\u03c6 \u2212 i(\u03a9\u2217 /2)t], causes no variation in the\ntotal flux. As mentioned in \u00a72.3 the present theory does\nnot predict the value of \u03b4T2dm .\n\n\f9\n5. nonlinear effect of unstable wave\n\nThe considered equilibrium disk (\u00a73) does not include\naccretion. However, the unstable Rossby mode discussed\nin \u00a74.1 gives rise to accretion in the vicinity of rR ,\nZ h\n\u1e40Ro = \u22122\u03c0r\ndz R(\u03b4\u03c1\u03b4u\u2217r ) ,\n(45a)\n\u2212h\n\nwhere h is the half-thickness of the disk. We evaluate\nthis by taking the most singular terms in \u2206\u03c9 in the limit\nwhere this quantity almost vanishes at r = rR . This gives\n\u03b4\u03c1 = 2k\u03c6 F \u03a8/(\u2206\u03c9L\u2217 ), and \u03b4ur = \u22122ik\u03c6 F \u03a8/\u03c1. Thus,\n\u1e40Ro = \u2212\n\n8\u03c9i hk\u03c62 |F |2 |\u03a8|2\n\n,\n(45b)\n\u03c1|\u2206\u03c9|2 L\u2217\nwhere \u03c9i > 0 is the growth rate and L\u2217 < 0. Thus, the\ninstability acts increase the mass accretion rate, \u1e40Ro > 0.\nThe unstable Rossby mode also gives an inflow of angular momentum,\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ h\n\u2217\n\u2217\nFRo = \u22122\u03c0r\ndz R(\u03b4\u03c1\u03b4ur )ru\u03c6 + \u03c1R(\u03b4ur r\u03b4u\u03c6 ) .\n\u2212h\n\n(46a)\nUsing the fact that \u03c1\u03b4u\u03c6 = \u2212k\u03c6 F \u03a8p\u2032\u2217 /(\u03c1\u03a9\u03c6 \u2206\u03c9L\u2217 ), we\nfind\nFRo = \u1e40Ro lQ ,\n(46b)\nwhere Q = (1 + u2K /u2\u03c6 )/2 and uK = r\u03a9K is the Keplerian\nvelocity. For the case of Figure 6, Q = 1.884. Because\nQ > 1, the Rossby mode transports inward more specific\nangular momentum l than exists in the equilibrium. Consequently, a nonlinear effect of the Rossby mode is to make\nthe positive slope of l(r) smaller in the vicinity of rR . A\nsufficiently large reduction of dl/dr may cause the growth\nrate to decrease.\n6. conclusions\n\nWe have investigated three modes of accretion disks\naround rotating magnetized neutron stars which may explain the separations of the kilo-Hertz quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO) seen in low mass X-ray binaries. This work\nis a continuation of the earlier work by LR07 where these\nmodes were identified. We develop the theory of compressible, non-barotropic MHD perturbations of an axisymmetric equilbrium flow with \u2202/\u2202z = 0. We assume that there\nis a maximum in the angular velocity \u03a9\u03c6 (r) of the accreting material larger than the angular velocity of the star\n\u03a9\u2217 , and that the fluid is in approximately circular motion\nnear this maximum rather than moving rapidly towards\nthe star or out of the disk plane into funnel flows. MHD\nsimulations by Romanova et al. (2002, 2008), Long et al.\n(2005), and Kulkarni & Romanova (2008) show this type\nof flow and \u03a9\u03c6 (r) profile.\nThe first mode we find is a Rossby wave instability or\nunstable corotation mode which is radially trapped in the\nvicinity of the maximum of a key function g(r)F (r) at\nrR . We derive a Schr\u00f6dinger type equation for the perturbation, \u03c6\u2032\u2032 = U (r)\u03c6, where U (r) is the effective potential. This instability is analogous to that found earlier by\nLovelace & Hohlfeld (1978), Lovelace et al. (1999), and\n\nLi et al. (2000) and in simulations by Li et al. (2001).\nThe real part of the angular frequency of the mode is\n\u03c9r = m\u03a9\u03c6 (rR ), where m = 1, 2... is the azimuthal mode\nnumber. The imaginary part of the frequency \u03c9i (the\ngrowth rate) is determined by a Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization of the perturbation in the effective potential. We\nargue that for generally oriented disk, the Doppler boost of\nthe disk surface emission from the unstable m = 1 mode\nwill give periodic variations in the total flux with angular frequency \u03c9r which we suggest is the higher frequency\ncomponent of the twin QPOs as proposed by LR07 The\nsaturation of the growth of this mode remains to be analyzed in detail in future work.\nThe second mode, is a mode driven by the rotating,\nnon-axisymmetric quadrupole [\u223c exp(i\u03c6)] and/or octupole\n[\u223c exp(2i\u03c6)] components of the star's magnetic field. It\nhas an angular frequency equal to the star's angular rotation rate \u03a9\u2217 . This mode is strongly excited near the\nradius of the Lindblad resonance which is slightly outside\nthe radius of the maximum of gF . When both the first and\nsecond modes are present the nonlinearity of the emission\nwill in general give a product term with angular frequency\n\u03c9r \u2212 \u03a9\u2217 . For a quadrupole field taking into account the\nDoppler boost, we find that the total flux has periodic\nvariations at three frequencies, \u03c9r , \u03a9\u2217 , and \u03c9r \u2212 \u03a9\u2217 . However, the frequency \u03a9\u2217 is usually not observed (van der\nKlis 2006). The situation is different for an octupole field\ncomponent again taking into account the Doppler boost.\nIn this case the total flux has periodic variations at two\nfrequencies, \u03c9r the upper QPO and \u03c9r \u2212 \u03a9\u2217 the lower\nQPO.\nThe third mode arises from the interaction of the flow\nperturbation with the rotating non-axisymmetric components of the star's magnetic field. This interaction arises\nnaturally owing to the fact that the magnetic force is\nproportional to the gradient of the square of the magnetic field. We derive a linear differential equation for\nthis driven modulated perturbation. We find that the angular frequency of the perturbation is \u03a9\u2217 /2 both for the\nquadrupole and the octupole field components. In the case\nof the octupole field component and taking into account\nthe Doppler boost, we find that the total flux has periodic variations at two frequencies, \u03c9r the upper QPO and\n\u03c9r \u2212 \u03a9\u2217 /2 the lower QPO. Because the equation for the\ndriven modulated perturbations is linear, the amplitude\nof the motion is indeterminate. One possibility is that the\n\u03a9\u2217 /2 motion is excited nonlinearly by the rotating nonaxisymmetric field which has frequency \u03a9\u2217 . This will be\ndiscussed in a future work. Thus present theory does not\ndetermine whether the lower QPO frequency is \u03c9r \u2212 \u03a9\u2217 or\n\u03c9r \u2212 \u03a9\u2217 /2.\nacknowledgements\nWe thank Mr. Akshay Kulkarni and Prof. Chengmin Zhang for helpful comments.
