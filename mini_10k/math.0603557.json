Introduction\nLet C/K be a smooth projective curve over a number field. Fix some K-rational\ndivisor class D of positive degree d (for example, the canonical class, if the genus\nof C is at least 2) and use it as a \"basepoint\" in order to map points on C to\npoints on the Jacobian J of C:\n\u03c6 : C \u220b P 7\u2212\u2192 [d * P ] \u2212 D \u2208 J\nNow, given a set \u03a3 \u2282 C(K) of rational points on C, we can ask ourselves how large\nthe subgroup of J(K) generated by \u03c6(\u03a3) may be. In particular, are the points\nin \u03a3 indpendent, i.e., does \u03c6(\u03a3) generate a group of rank #\u03a3?\nWe can also turn around this question - we take a subgroup G \u2282 J(K) and ask\nhow many points in C(K) map into G. In this paper, we will give answers to these\nquestions when C is a twist of a fixed curve. It will turn out that we get fairly tight\nbounds if the number of points (or the rank of the subgroup) is sufficiently small\nrelative to the genus, as long as we are willing to accept finitely many exceptions\n(which can be found in an explicitly given finite set of twists).\nWe give a few applications. The first one deals with quadratic twists of hyperelliptic curves. For simplicity, we formulate the result with Q as the base field,\nthough it is valid for any number field. For hyperelliptic curves, we use the class\nof twice a Weierstrass point as our \"basepoint\" D.\nDate: February 27, 2006.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Let C : y 2 = f (x) be a hyperelliptic curve over Q of genus g \u2265 2,\nwhere f \u2208 Z[x] is squarefree. Let \u2206 be the discriminant of f , considered as a\npolynomial of degree 2g + 2. Let d \u2208 Z be a squarefree integer and n \u2264 g a natural\nnumber such that d is divisible by a prime p > 2n + 1 that does not divide \u2206. Let\nCd : d y 2 = f (x) be the quadratic twist of C associated to d, and denote by \u03b9 the\nhyperelliptic involution. Then any set \u03a3 \u2282 Cd (Q) of rational points on Cd such\nthat #\u03a3 \u2264 n and \u03a3 \u2229 \u03b9(\u03a3) = \u2205 generates a subgroup of rank #\u03a3 in the Jacobian\nof Cd .\nNote that the exceptional values of d are squarefree integers with prime divisors in\nthe finite set {p | p \u2264 2n + 3 or p|\u2206} and so are finite in number. The condition\n\u03a3 \u2229 \u03b9(\u03a3) = \u2205 is necessary, since \u03c6(\u03b9(P )) = \u2212\u03c6(P ) provides a trivial dependence.\nSeen from the other side, we can state this result in the following form.\nTheorem 1.2. Keep the notations of Thm. 1.1. Assume that the Mordell-Weil\nrank r of the Jacobian of Cd satisfies r < g and that the prime p dividing d\nsatisfies p > 2r + 3 and does not divide \u2206. Then Cd has at most r pairs of rational\nnon-Weierstrass points.\nAgain there are only finitely many exceptional squarefree d, contained in an explicit finite set. This result is obviously best possible, except that it does not say\nanything about the excluded cases.\nThe next application is to Thue equations.\nTheorem 1.3. Let F \u2208 Z[X, Y ] be homogeneous of degree n \u2265 3 and squarefree.\nLet h \u2208 Z be an integer not divisible by the nth power of any prime, such that h\nhas a prime factor p > n + r + 1 that does not divide the discriminant of F , where\nr is the Mordell-Weil rank of the Jacobian of the curve given by the Thue equation\n(1.1)\n\nF (X, Y ) = h .\n\nIf r \u2264 n \u2212 3, then this equation has at most r rational solutions. More generally,\nif r \u2264 21 n(n \u2212 3) and p > n + 2r + 1, then there are at most 2r rational solutions.\nThe possible exceptions are again finite in number and contained in an explicitly\ngiven set. It is interesting to compare this with the bound of Lorenzini and Tucker\n[LT02], Thm. 3.11, which is that there are at most 2n3 \u2212 2n \u2212 3 primitive integral\nsolutions to (1.1) if r \u2264 12 n(n \u2212 3). The bound is weaker, but it holds for all h\n(subject to the rank condition). On the other hand, our result, when applicable,\neven bounds the number of rational solutions, and our bound is much stronger.\nIn a similar way, we can state a general bound on the number of rational points\non twists of a fixed curve. For a curve C, denote by Ctriv the set of points that\nare fixed by some nontrivial (geometric) automorphism of C and by Ctors the set\nof points that map to a torsion point in the Jacobian, where we have chosen the\n\"basepoint\" D to be invariant under the automorophism group of C. We denote\nby r(C) the Mordell-Weil rank of J(K), where J is the Jacobian of C.\n\n\fINDEPENDENCE OF RATIONAL POINTS\n\n3\n\nTheorem 1.4. Fix a curve C of genus g \u2265 2 over a number field K. Then for all\nbut finitely many twists C \u2032 /K of C such that r(C \u2032 ) < g, we have\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n#C \u2032 (K) \u2264 fC (r(C \u2032 )) + #Ctriv\n(K) + #(Ctriv\n\\ (Ctriv\n(K) \u222a Ctors\n)) .\n\nHere, fC is a function that depends on the geometry of C; for 0 \u2264 r < g, we have\nr \u2264 fC (r) \u2264 2r.\nIn particular, this implies that within the family of twists of rank < g of C, the\nnumber of rational points is bounded. This is not new; it follows from a result\ndue to Silverman [Sil93], which states that\n\u2032\n\n#C \u2032 (K) \u2264 \u03b3(C/K) 7r(C )\nfor all twists C \u2032 , with a constant \u03b3(C/K) depending only on C/K, which is effective\nin principle, but which nobody has tried to find a value for, as far as we know.\nSilverman's result is stronger than ours in that it covers all twists, regardless of\nthe rank. On the other hand, our result is stronger than Silverman's in that it\nprovides a much better bound, when it applies. It should be mentioned, however,\nthat the so-called Lang conjecture on varieties of general type would imply that\nthe number of rational points on any curve (of genus at least 2) is bounded by a\nconstant only depending on the genus and the degree of the base field, see [CHM97]\nand [Pac97].\nAs a final application, we remark that one can use the method developed here to\nobtain sharp bounds for the number of rational points on twists of fixed rank. For\nexample, a detailed study of the possible behaviour at small primes shows that\nfor the family\nCA : y 2 = x5 + A\n(with A an integer not divisible by the tenth power of any prime), the maximal\nnumber of rational points is 7 when r(CA ) = 1, and this maximum is attained\nonly for the curve that has A = 182 . Note that the general result proved in this\npaper implies that all but finitely many of these curves (such that r(CA ) = 1)\nhave at most 5 rational points. The more specific arguments necessary to obtain\nthe precise result stated above are given in [Sto06].\nAs is already apparent to the cognoscenti from the small rank conditions in the\nresults given above, we use a version of the Chabauty-Coleman method for the\nproof. The main new ingredient is to apply this method over an extension field\nof a completion Kv , where v is a place of bad reduction for the twist in question.\nSurprisingly, this leads to much better bounds than working directly with Kv or\nat primes of good reduction.\nIn the next sections, we state the main theorem and deduce the results given\nabove. We then proceed to review the Chabauty-Coleman method. Finally, we\napply this method to prove our main theorem.\nAcknowledgements.

Then, but certainly not\nless important, I want to thank Nils Bruin, Noam Elkies, Dino Lorenzini, Bjorn\n\n\f4\n\nMICHAEL STOLL\n\nPoonen, Ed Schaefer, Joe Silverman and Joe Wetherell for useful, interesting and\nsometimes inspiring conversations, either directly or by email.\n2. Notation\nFor a field K, we denote by K\u0304 a fixed algebraic closure. When \u0393 is a (not necessarily abelian) group, on which the absolute Galois group of K acts, we denote\nby H 1 (K, \u0393) the first Galois cohomology; for non-abelian \u0393, this is a pointed set\n(see [Ser97], \u00a7 5). We let the Galois group act on the right and write the action\nexponentially: P \u03c3 .\nWe continue to use the notation from the introduction. So C/K is a smooth\nprojective curve over a number field. The Jacobian of C is denoted J. It is an\nabelian variety over K of dimension g = g(C), the genus of C. We fix a K-rational\ndivisor (or divisor class) D on C of degree d > 0 (which will have to satisfy a\ncertain invariance condition, see below; if g \u2265 2, we can always take the canonical\nclass) and use it to map C into J via \u03c6 : P 7\u2192 [dP \u2212 D].\nIt then makes sense to define Ctors as the preimage of the torsion points in J. Note\nthat this set is finite when the genus of C is at least two, see Raynaud's proof of\nthe Manin-Mumford conjecture in [Ray83].\n3. Some Geometry\nFor a K\u0304-defined divisor D on C, we let \u03a9(D) denote the K\u0304-vector space of differentials \u03c9 satisfying (\u03c9) \u2265 D. We then define the function fC : Z\u22650 \u2192 Z\u22650 \u222a {\u221e}\nas follows.\nfC (r) = max{deg D | D \u2265 0 and dim \u03a9(D) \u2265 g \u2212 r} ,\nwhere D runs through all effective divisors on C. We obviously have fC (r) = \u221e\nas soon as r \u2265 g. For the interesting values of r, we have the following results.\nLemma 3.1.\n(1) If 0 \u2264 r < g, then r \u2264 fC (r) \u2264 2r.\n(2) fC (0) = 0, fC (g \u2212 1) = 2g \u2212 2.\n(3) C is hyperelliptic if and only if fC (1) = 2, if and only if fC (r) = 2r for\n0 \u2264 r < g.\n(4) If C is a smooth plane curve of degree n, then\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012\nn\nn\u22121 o\nk\nn\u2212a\n.\n<g=\n\u2212 1 , where a = max k r +\nfC (r) = r +\n2\n2\n2\nIn particular, fC (r) = r for r \u2264 n \u2212 3 in this case.\nProof. 1) The lower bound follows from dim \u03a9(D) \u2265 g \u2212 deg D for any effective\ndivisor D. For the upper bound, we use Riemann-Roch and the standard bound\ndim L(D) \u2264 1 + deg D/2 for D such that 0 \u2264 deg D \u2264 2g. This gives\ng \u2212 r \u2264 dim \u03a9(D) = dim L(D) \u2212 deg D + g \u2212 1 \u2264 g \u2212 deg D/2\n\n\fINDEPENDENCE OF RATIONAL POINTS\n\n5\n\nand so deg D \u2264 2r. 2) Clear. 3), 4) The facts about hyperelliptic and plane curves\nare well-known.\n\u0003\nWhen we consider fC/kv (r) for the reduction of C at a place v of K of good\nreduction for C (where kv is the residue field), it is possible that fC/kv (r) > fC (r)\nfor certain v and r. For example, the Klein Quartic, a smooth plane quartic curve,\nhas over a certain number field K that is totally ramified at 7 a model that reduces\nto a hyperelliptic curve at the place above 7, see [Elk99]. In this case, we have\nfC (1) = 1, but fC/kv (1) = 2.\nHowever, we have the following result.\nProposition 3.2. For all but finitely many places v of K such that C has good\nreduction at v, we have fC/kv = fC .\nProof. Let\nFC (d) = max{dim L(D) | D \u2265 0 and deg D = d}\nbe the largest dimension of a Riemann-Roch space of an effective divisor of degree d; define FC/kv similarly. Then, since by the Riemann-Roch Theorem,\ndim L(D) = deg D \u2212 g + 1 + dim \u03a9(D) ,\nwe have, for 0 \u2264 r < g,\nfC (r) = max{d | FC (d) \u2265 d \u2212 r + 1} ,\nand similary for fC/kv . Therefore it is sufficient to show the statement with FC\nand FC/kv in place of fC and fC/kv .\nNow choose a smooth projective model C/OS of C over some ring of S-integers\nOS in K. Then we have a canonical morphism\n\u03c6 : SymdOS C \u2212\u2192 PicdOS C =: W\nfrom the dth symmetric power of the OS -scheme C into the degree-d component\nof the relative Picard scheme of C over OS . According to our definition,\nFC (d) = 1 + max{dim \u03c6\u22121 (w) | w \u2208 W(K\u0304)}\nand\nFC/kv (d) = 1 + max{dim \u03c6\u22121 (w) | w \u2208 W(k\u0304v )} .\nNow the subscheme of W of points w such that the dimension of the fiber \u03c6\u22121 (w) is\nat least a certain number n is constructible and so is its image Xn in Spec OS under\nthe structure morphism (see [Har77], Exc. II.3.19 and II.3.22, or [CC55], exp. 7\nand 8). Also, these schemes will be empty for n > d \u2212 g. For 0 \u2264 n \u2264 FC (d),\nXn will contain the generic point of Spec OS ; for larger n, it will not. The set\nof places v outside S such that FC/kv (d) 6= FC (d) is therefore contained in the\nconstructible subscheme\nFC (d)\nd\u2212g\n[\n[\nX (d) =\nXn .\n(Spec OS \\ Xn ) \u222a\nn=0\n\nn=FC (d)+1\n\nSince X (d) does not contain the generic point, it is finite, and since we have to\nconsider only d \u2264 2g \u22122, the set of places v such that FC/kv 6= FC is also finite. \u0003\n\n\f6\n\nMICHAEL STOLL\n\nIt is a different matter to actually find the \"mildly bad\" places v such that the\ncurve has good reduction at v, but \"its geometry changes\" under reduction, in the\nsense that fC changes. For practical purposes, we will therefore choose a function\nf \u0303C , together with a set of \"bad\" places SC such that for all places v \u2208\n/ SC , C has\n \u0303\ngood reduction at v and fC/kv \u2264 fC . Of course, Prop. 3.2 says that there is always\nsome such set SC that works with f \u0303C = fC .\nProposition 3.3. The following are possible choices for f \u0303C and SC .\n(1) f \u0303C (r) = 2r and SC = places of bad reduction.\n(2) If C is a smooth plane curve, pick a projective plane model C/O over the\nintegers of K and take f \u0303C = fC and SC = places of bad reduction of the\nmodel C.\nProof. Clear.\n\n\u0003\n\nNote that hyperelliptic curves are always \"worst-case\" for fC , and so we lose\nnothing if we take the first alternative above in this case.\nFor the following, we let K be an arbitrary field. Recall that the set of twists of C,\ni.e., the set of curves C \u2032 /K, isomorphic to C over K\u0304, up to isomorphism over K,\nis parametrized by the Galois cohomology set H 1 (K, AutK\u0304 (C)). Given such a\ntwist C \u2032 and a K\u0304-isomorphism \u03c6 : C \u2032 \u2212\u2192 C, the corresponding cohomology class\nis represented by the cocycle \u03be : \u03c3 7\u2192 \u03c6\u03c3 \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121 ; see for example Silverman's\nbook [Sil86], \u00a7 X.2.\nFor the purposes of this paper, it is useful to introduce a more general notion.\nA twist C \u2032 of C is called a \u0393-twist of C if the corresponding cohomology class\nlies in the image of H 1 (K, \u0393) in H 1 (K, AutK\u0304 (C)). This means that there is a\nK\u0304-isomorphism \u03c6 : C \u2032 \u2212\u2192 C such that the cocycle \u03be : \u03c3 7\u2192 \u03c6\u03c3 \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121 takes values\nin \u0393. For such a cocycle, we will denote the corresponding \u0393-twist of C by C\u03be .\nAn important example is given by quadratic twists of hyperelliptic curves; here\nwe take for \u0393 the subgroup of order two of the automorphism group generated by\nthe hyperelliptic involution.\n4. The main result - local version\nIn this section, we consider a smooth projective curve C of genus g \u2265 1 over a\np-adic field K. We denote by v its normalized additive valuation, by O its ring of\nintegers, and by k its residue field. GK is the absolute Galois group of K, relative\nto a fixed algebraic closure K\u0304, and IK \u2282 GK denotes the inertia group. K unr is\nthe maximal unramified extension of K (inside K\u0304).\nWe will always assume that C has good reduction, so that there is a smooth\nprojective curve C/O with generic fiber C.\nLet \u0393 \u2282 AutK\u0304 (C) be a finite K-defined subgroup of the (geometric) automorphism\ngroup of C. We always assume that v(#\u0393) = 0, i.e., that the order of \u0393 is prime\nto the residue characteristic p.\n\n\fINDEPENDENCE OF RATIONAL POINTS\n\n7\n\nProposition 4.1. Under the assumptions made, IK acts trivially on \u0393.\nProof. Let \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 and \u03c3 \u2208 IK , and set \u03c6 = \u03b3 \u22121 \u03b3 \u03c3 \u2208 \u0393. We have to show that\n\u03c6 is the identity. Now, since g \u2265 1 and C is the minimal proper regular model\nof C (trivially), \u03c6 extends to an automorphism of C, see for example [Sil94],\nProp. IV.4.6. (We base-extend C to the ring of integers of the field of definition\nof \u03c6; since we have good reduction, we still have a minimal proper regular model.)\nSince IK acts trivially on the special fiber of C, the automorphism induced by \u03c6\non the special fiber is the identity. Pick some point P \u2208 C(k\u0304) and consider its\nresidue class\nDP = {Q \u2208 C(K\u0304) | Q\u0304 = P } ,\n(where Q\u0304 is the image of Q in the special fiber of C). We claim that either \u03c6 is the\nidentity on DP or else it has a unique fixed point on DP . Given that, it follows\nthat \u03c6 = 1 in \u0393: in any case, \u03c6 has at least one fixed point on every residue class\nDP ; since there are infinitely many residue classes, \u03c6 has infinitely many fixed\npoints on C and thus must be the identity automorphism.\nLet us now prove the claim. Consider a finite extension L of K such that \u03c6 is\ndefined over L and P is defined over the residue class field of L. Then\nDP (L) = DP \u2229 C(L)\ncan be parametrized analytically by the maximal ideal pL of OL , and in this\nparametrization, the action of \u03c6 is given by a power series\nF\u03c6 (T ) = \u03b10 + \u03b11 T + * * * \u2208 OL [T ]\nwith vL (\u03b10 ) > 0, since the action fixes pL . Now \u03c6m = 1 with some m prime to p,\nso, reducing mod pL ,\nF\u0304\u03c6\u25e6m (T ) = \u1fb11m T + * * * = T .\nHence \u03b11 is a unit reducing to an mth root of unity. Suppose first that \u1fb11 = 1\nand that F\u03c6 (T ) 6= T (otherwise, \u03c6 is the identity on DP ). Write\nF\u03c6 (T ) = T + \u03c0Ln F\u0303 (T )\nfor the maximal possible n; we claim that n \u2265 1. Otherwise, write (mod pL )\nF\u0304\u03c6 (T ) = T + \u03b2T N + O(T N +1)\nwith N \u2265 2 and \u03b2 6= 0; then\nT = F\u0304\u03c6\u25e6m (T ) = T + m\u03b2T N + O(T N +1 ) ,\na contradiction. So in the above, n \u2265 1, and F\u0303 will not reduce to zero mod pL .\nIterating, we get\nT = F\u03c6\u25e6m (T ) = T + m \u03c0Ln F\u0303 (T ) + O(\u03c0L2n ) ,\nwhich is a contradiction. So when \u1fb11 = 1, \u03c6 is the identity on DP .\nOtherwise, \u03b11 \u2212 1 is a unit, and then F\u03c6 (T ) = T has a unique solution in pL , by\na standard Newton polygon argument. It follows that \u03c6 has a unique fixed point\non DP (L). Since this holds for all fields L as above, there is also a unique fixed\npoint on DP .\n\u0003\n\n\f8\n\nMICHAEL STOLL\n\nThis result, a special case of which is the similar statement on torsion points on\nelliptic curves (see [Sil86], Prop. VII.4.1), has the following consequence.\nProposition 4.2. Let \u03b1 \u2208 H 1 (K, \u0393) be a cohomology class, represented by a\ncocycle \u03be. Then the restriction \u03be|IK is a homomorphism IK \u2212\u2192 \u0393, and its image\nis a cyclic subgroup of \u0393, whose conjugacy class only depends on \u03b1.\nProof. Since by Prop. 4.1 IK acts trivially on \u0393, the cocycle condition for \u03be on IK\nsimply means that \u03be|IK is a homomorphism. Since p \u2224 #\u0393, this homomorphism has\nto factor through a (finite) quotient of IK of order prime to p. All such quotients\nare cyclic. The last statement follows from the definition of cohomology classes\nin H 1(IK , \u0393) (and again the fact that IK acts trivially).\n\u0003\nFor \u03be \u2208 Z 1 (K, \u0393), we define its type t(\u03be) to be the cyclic subgroup\nt(\u03be) = \u03be(IK ) \u2282 \u0393 .\nWith these notations, we can state the main theorem in its local version.\nTheorem 4.3. Let C/K be a smooth projective curve of genus g \u2265 1, such that\nC has good reduction. Choose \u0393 as above, and pick a divisor class D of positive\ndegree that is fixed under \u0393 in order to define the map \u03c6 : C \u2212\u2192 J.\nLet \u03be \u2208 Z 1 (K, \u0393) be a cocycle whose cohomology class is ramified, and let C\u03be be\nthe corresponding twist of C, with map \u03c6\u03be : C\u03be \u2212\u2192 J\u03be . Assume that\np > #t(\u03be) v(p) + fC/k (r) + 1\nfor some 0 \u2264 r < g. Let K \u2032 /K be an unramified extension, and let\nF\u03be = {P \u2208 C\u03be (K\u0304) | P fixed under t(\u03be)} .\nPick a subgroup G of J\u03be (K \u2032 ) of rank r and set\nT = {P \u2208 C\u03be (K \u2032 ) | \u03c6\u03be (P ) \u2208 G} .\nIf F\u03be is empty, then T is empty, and otherwise\n#T \u2264 fC/k (r) + #(T \u2229 F\u03be ) + #(F\u03be \\ (T \u222a C\u03be,tors )) .\nThe proof will be given in section 7 below.\n5. The main result - global version\nWe are now back in the global situation, where C/K is a smooth projective curve\nover a number field.\nWe let \u0393 \u2282 AutK\u0304 (C) be a finite K-defined subgroup of the automorphism group\nof C and let\nC \u0393-triv = {P \u2208 C | \u03b3(P ) = P for some 1 6= \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393}\nbe the set of \u0393-trivial points on C; C \u0393-triv is a finite (possibly empty) subset of C.\nFor the \"basepoint\" of the map of C into its Jacobian, we will always choose a\ndivisor class of positive degree that is invariant under \u0393.\n\n\fINDEPENDENCE OF RATIONAL POINTS\n\n9\n\nWe let m(\u0393) denote the maximal order of an element of \u0393 that fixes at least one\npoint on C.\nRecall the notation f \u0303C and SC from section 3.\nTheorem 5.1. Let C/K be a smooth projective curve of genus g, and let \u0393 be a\nK-defined finite subgroup of the automorphism group of C. Let C\u03be be a \u0393-twist\nof C such that \u03be is ramified at some place v of K outside SC . Assume that the\nresidue characteristic p of v satisfies\np > m(\u0393) ev + f \u0303C (r) + 1\nfor some r < g, where ev is the ramification index of Kv over Qp . Let G be a\nsubgroup of J\u03be (K) of rank r and let T = {P \u2208 C\u03be (K) | \u03c6\u03be (P ) \u2208 G}. Then\n#T \u2264 f \u0303C (r) + #(T \u2229 C\u03be\u0393-triv) + #(C\u03be\u0393-triv \\ (T \u222a C\u03be,tors )) .\nProof. This follows from Thm. 4.3, applied to C over Kv , since F\u03be \u2282 C\u03be\u0393-triv and\n#t(\u03be) \u2264 m(\u0393).\n\u0003\nThe bound can be read as \"f \u0303C (r), plus the trivial points in T , plus the trivial nontorsion points outside T \". The last contribution is somewhat annoying (the first\ncan be considered as bounding the non-trivial points in T ). Luckily, in many cases,\nall the trivial points are torsion, and so this contribution vanishes. A sufficient\ncondition for this is that all the quotients C/h\u03b3i have genus zero, for all 1 6= \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393\nhaving at least one fixed point on C.\nIn cases where this last contribution cannot be shown to vanish, it may be possible\nto improve the bound by noting that it can be replaced by\nmax{#(C h\u03b3i \\ Ctors ) | 1 6= \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393} ,\nthe maximal number of non-torsion fixed points of any nontrivial automorphism\nin \u0393, which bounds #(F\u03be \\ (T \u222a C\u03be,tors )) in Thm. 4.3.\nNow let us proceed to prove the results given in the introduction. To prove\nThm. 1.1, we set K = Q and \u0393 = \u03bc2 acting on y. Then C \u0393-triv consists of\nthe Weierstrass points, which map to zero in the Jacobian, i.e., C \u0393-triv \u2282 Ctors ,\nand the same holds for all the quadratic twists. Hence the last term in the bound\nabove vanishes. Now take \u03a3 \u2282 Cd (Q) as in Thm. 1.1 and let G be the subgroup\ngenerated by \u03a3 in the Jacobian. The set T in our theorem above then contains\n\u03a3 \u222a \u03b9(\u03a3) and the rational Weierstrass points of Cd . We assume that r < #\u03a3; then\n2#\u03a3 + #(T \u2229 Cd\u0393-triv) \u2264 #T \u2264 2r + #(T \u2229 Cd\u0393-triv ) ,\na contradiction. Therefore, we must have r = #\u03a3. Note that the condition on\nramification reduces to p | d with p > 2#\u03a3 + 1 and such that C has good reduction\nat p ; the latter condition is implied by p not dividing the discriminant of f .\nThe proof of Thm. 1.2 is very similar. Here we take for G the Mordell-Weil group\nJd (Q); then T = Cd (Q) in Thm. 5.1, which then says that\n#Cd (Q) \u2264 2r + #{Weierstrass points in Cd (Q)} .\n\n\f10\n\nMICHAEL STOLL\n\nTo prove Thm. 1.3, we consider the smooth plane projective curve\nC : Z n = F (X, Y ) .\nWe take \u0393 = \u03bcn , acting on Z, and we let G be the Mordell-Weil group in the\nJacobian of the twist Ch : h Z n = F (X, Y ). If its rank r is at most n \u2212 3, then\nfC (r) = r, and we get the same value for the reduction mod p when p does not\ndivide the discriminant of F . Furthermore, the trivial points all have Z = 0 (and\nthey all belong to Ctors ), so we do not see them in the affine equation (1.1). Hence\nonly the first term in the bound remains, which is r. The ramification conditions\nagain boil down to p | h with p > n+r+1 and p \u2224 disc(F ). The more general bound\nfor larger r follows similarly, using that fC (r) \u2264 2r. Note that g = 21 (n \u2212 1)(n \u2212 2).\nThe next result, Thm. 1.4, follows directly from Thm. 5.1 above, noting that the\nramification condition is violated only for a finite set of cocycle classes. Here we\npick a set SC that is large enough so that we can choose f \u0303C = fC .\nAnother easy application is the following.\nProposition 5.2. Let l \u2265 9 be an odd integer. Then there are infinitely many\n2lth power free integers A such that r(Cl,A) \u2265 4, where Cl,A : y 2 = xl + A.\nProof. We take C = Cl,1 and \u0393 = \u03bc2 \u00d7 \u03bcl . Then we can deduce that for all\nbut finitely many A, a set of n points in Cl,A (Q) with nonvanishing x-coordinate\nand positive y-coordinate will generate a subgroup of rank n in the Mordell-Weil\ngroup, provided n \u2264 g = (l \u2212 1)/2 \u2265 4. Since the family\nY 2 + Y = X l + t2l\nprovides infinitely many curves Cl,A that have at least four such points (given by\nX \u2208 {\u2212t, t, \u2212t2 , t4 }), the claim follows.\n\u0003\nThe statement is also true for l = 5 and 7, as can be shown by more direct\nmethods.\n6. The Chabauty-Coleman machine\nThe Chabauty-Coleman method consists in bounding the number of K-rational\npoints of C, where K is a number field, in terms of the number of zeros of certain\ndifferentials of C/K, where K = Kv for some finite place v of K. We will extend\nthe method and allow K to be some finite extension of Kv .\nThe basic result of this method is a bound for the number of Kv -points mapping\ninto a subgroup of rank r < g in the Jacobian, which takes the form (see Thm. 6.6\nbelow)\n#X + fC/kv (r) + \u2206v (#X , fC/kv (r)) .\nThe first term is the number of residue classes the points are sitting in, the second\nterm comes from the zeros of differentials and was up to now taken to be 2g \u2212 2\nin published applications of the method. We improve this part of the bound by\nreplacing it with fC/kv (r). The third term is a contribution that has to be put in\nto account for the possible presence of small denominators divisible by p in the\nlogarithm series. It vanishes if p is large enough. On the other hand, the first\n\n\fINDEPENDENCE OF RATIONAL POINTS\n\n11\n\nterm usually grows with p. The new trick we use to obtain our main result lets us\nkeep #X small while p is large.\nSince we need the precise statement with the improvement we introduce, we provide proofs of the relevant facts.\nLet us first set some notation. As before, K will be a p-adic local field with\nnormalised valuation v, uniformiser \u03c0 and residue class field k (of characteristic p).\nWe will denote the ring of integers of K by O.\nSometimes we will consider a finite field extension L/K; then we denote the objects\nassociated to L by vL , kL , OL etc.\nWe let e = v(p) be the ramification index of K/Qp and define\n\u03b4(v, n) = max{d \u2265 0 | n + d + 1 \u2212 v(n + d + 1) \u2264 n + 1 \u2212 v(n + 1)}\n= max{d \u2265 0 | e vp (n + 1) + d \u2264 e vp (n + d + 1)} .\nFor s, r \u2265 0, let\n\u2206v (s, r) = max\n\ns\nnX\n\n\u03b4(v, mj )\n\nj=1\n\ns\nX\nj=1\n\no\nmj \u2264 r .\n\nNote that \u2206v is obviously an increasing function in both arguments.\nWe need to bound \u03b4 and \u2206 from above.\nLemma 6.1. If p > e + 1, then \u03b4(v, n) \u2264 e \u230an/(p \u2212 e \u2212 1)\u230b. In particular, if\np > n + e + 1, then \u03b4(v, n) = 0.\nProof. If \u03b4(v, n) = d, then evp (n + d + 1) \u2265 evp (n + 1) + d \u2265 d. This implies that\np\u2308d/e\u2309 divides n + d + 1, so p\u2308d/e\u2309 \u2264 n + d + 1. Hence we always have\n\u03b4(v, n) \u2264 e max{d | pd \u2264 n + ed + 1} .\nNow suppose p \u2265 e + 2. Then by an easy induction, we see that pd \u2212 ed \u2212 1 \u2265\n(p \u2212 e \u2212 1)d for all d \u2265 0, hence d \u2264 n/(p \u2212 e \u2212 1) for all d in the set above. \u0003\nLemma 6.2. If p > e + 1, we have\n\u2206v (s, r) \u2264 e \u230ar/(p \u2212 e \u2212 1)\u230b .\nIn particular, if p > r + e + 1, then \u2206v (s, r) = 0.\nProof. This follows immediately from Lemma 6.1 and the definitions.\n\n\u0003\n\nIn the following, we will assume that C/K has good reduction. We will denote by\nC a smooth model of C over O. Let Cs denote the special fiber of C. The preimage\nof a point P \u2208 Cs (k\u0304) under the reduction map \u03c1 : C(K\u0304) \u2212\u2192 Cs (k\u0304) is called a\nresidue class and denoted by DP . We write DP (K) for DP \u2229 C(K).\nWe write \u03a9(C/K) for the K-vector space of global regular (K-rational) differentials on C. This space has dimension g.\nThere is a pairing\n\u03a9(C/K) \u00d7 J(K) \u2212\u2192 K\nwith trivial left kernel and right kernel J(K)tors ; it is given by a logarithm map, see\n[McC94] or [Wet97]. So when the rank r(C) of J(K) is less than g, the dimension\n\n\f12\n\nMICHAEL STOLL\n\nof \u03a9(C/K), then there is a subspace \u039b of \u03a9(C/K) of codimension at most r(C)\nthat annihilates J(K).\nWe will use a more general setup here. Let G \u2282 J(K) be a subgroup of torsion-free\nrank r < g (i.e., r = dimQ G \u2297Z Q). Furthermore, let \u1e20 be the saturation of G,\ni.e.,\n\u1e20 = {P \u2208 J(K) | nP \u2208 G for some n > 0} .\nWe define\n\u039b = \u039b(G) = {\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9(C/K) | \u03c9 kills G} .\nThen we obviously have codim \u039b \u2264 r, i.e., dim \u039b \u2265 g \u2212 r. Note that \u039b kills not\nonly G, but also \u1e20.\nLet X be the set of points in C(K) that map into \u1e20 under the fixed map of C\ninto J. For example, we could have G = J(K), then X \u2283 C(K) \u222a C(K)tors . We\nlet X denote the image of X in Cs (k).\nLet 0 6= \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9(C/K). Then (since \u03a9(C/O) is a lattice in \u03a9(C/K)) there is a\nmultiple of \u03c9 reducing to a nonzero differential \u03c9\u0304 \u2208 \u03a9(Cs /k). If P \u2208 Cs (k) is a\npoint, we denote by n(\u03c9, P ) = vP (\u03c9\u0304) the order of vanishing of \u03c9\u0304 in P . We write\n\u03bd(P ) = #(DP \u2229 X).\nThen we have the following result.\nProposition 6.3. Let 0 6= \u03c9 \u2208 \u039b, and let P \u2208 Cs (k). Then\n\u03bd(P ) \u2264 1 + n(\u03c9, P ) + \u03b4(v, n(\u03c9, P )) .\nProof. Without loss of generality, \u03c9 itself reduces to \u03c9\u0304. For simplicity, write n for\nn(\u03c9, P ). Choose a uniformizer t at a point in DP (K); since\n\u03c9\u0304 = (u t\u0304n + higher order terms) dt\u0304\nwith u \u2208 k \u00d7 , \u03c9 has an expansion with coefficients in O,\n\u03c9 = (a0 + a1 t + a2 t2 + . . . ) dt ,\nwhere a0 , a1 , . . . , an\u22121 have positive valuation and an is a v-adic unit. The\nlogarithm corresponding to \u03c9 is then given on DP (K) by\nam\n\u03bb\u03c9 (Q) = c + a0 \u03c0 T + * * * +\n\u03c0 m+1 T m+1 + * * * = \u03bb(T ) ,\nm+1\nwhere t(Q) = \u03c0 T , T \u2208 O, and c is a constant of integration. By a standard\nNewton polygon argument, \u03bb\u03c9 has at most n + 1 + \u03b4(v, n) zeros on DP (K), since\nthese zeros correspond to integral zeros of the power series \u03bb.\nSince X \u2229 DP is contained in this set of zeros (for \u03bb\u03c9 kills X by definition), the\nclaim follows.\n\u0003\nThis result prompts the following definitions.\nn(\u039b, P ) = min{n(\u03c9, P ) | 0 6= \u03c9 \u2208 \u039b}\nX\nN(\u039b, C/K) =\nn(\u039b, P ) ,\nP\n\nwhere the sum extends over the points P \u2208 Cs (k).\n\nand\n\n\fINDEPENDENCE OF RATIONAL POINTS\n\n13\n\nIn their paper [LT02], p. 59, Lorenzini and Tucker ask whether it is possible to\nsharpen the trivial bound N(\u039b, C/K) \u2264 2g \u2212 2 to get N(\u039b, C/K) \u2264 2 codim \u039b.\nWe can give an affirmative (and even better) answer. Let fC/k be defined as in\nsection 3.\nTheorem 6.4. Let C/K be a smooth projective curve of genus g, and let 0 6= \u039b\nbe a K-linear subspace of \u03a9(C/K). If C has good reduction, then\nN(\u039b, C/K) \u2264 fC/k (codim \u039b) \u2264 2 codim \u039b .\nProof. Because of good reduction, there is a well-defined reduction map\n\u03c1 : P(\u03a9(C/K)) \u2212\u2192 P(\u03a9(Cs /k)) ,\nwhich preserves dimensions of subspaces. Let \u039b\u0304 be the linear subspace corresponding to the image of P(\u039b); it has dimension dim \u039b. For any \u03c9 \u2208 P(\u03a9(C/K)), we\nhave n(\u03c9, P ) = vP (\u03c1(\u03c9)). Let D be the effective divisor\nX\nn(\u039b, P ) * P\nD=\nP\n\non Cs ; then N(\u039b, C/K) = deg D \u2264 2g \u2212 2 and \u03c9 \u2208 \u039b\u0304 implies (\u03c9) \u2265 D. So\nN(\u039b, C/K) \u2264 max{deg D | D \u2265 0, dim \u03a9(D) \u2265 dim \u039b} = fC/k (codim \u039b) .\n\u0003\nRemark 6.5. This result is still true when C is hyperelliptic and of bad reduction.\nHowever, to formulate the method in the case of bad reduction requires the use\nof a minimal proper regular model, and since we do not need this case here, we\nrefrain from giving the details.\nWe now have the following \"master theorem\" for the Chabauty-Coleman method.\nTheorem 6.6. Let G \u2282 J(K) be a subgroup of rank r < g, let\nX = {P \u2208 C(K) | \u03c6(P ) \u2208 \u1e20} ,\nand let X be the image of X in Cs . Then we have the bound\n#X \u2264 #X + fC/k (r) + \u2206v (#X , fC/k (r)) .\nFurthermore, when p > fC/k (r) + e + 1, we have\n#X \u2264 #X + fC/k (r) .\nProof. Sum the bounds of Prop. 6.3 over the residue classes corresponding to\npoints in X and use Thm. 6.4 and Lemma 6.2.\n\u0003\nAs a corollary, we get a refinement of Coleman's bound [Col85].\nCorollary 6.7. Let K be a number field, C/K a curve, and suppose that C has\ngood reduction at the finite place v of K. Let K = Kv , and let C/O be a model\n\n\f14\n\nMICHAEL STOLL\n\nof C with good reduction. Then if the rank r(C) of J(K) is less than the genus\nof C, we have\n#C(K) \u2264 #C(k) + fC/kv (r(C)) + \u2206v (#C(k), fC (r(C)))\n\u2264 #C(k) + 2 r(C) + \u2206v (#C(k), 2 r(C)) .\nIf in addition p > fC/kv (r(C)) + ev + 1, where p is the residue characteristic of v,\nthen we have\n#C(K) \u2264 #C(k) + fC/kv (r(C)) \u2264 #C(k) + 2 r(C) .\nProof. We choose G = J(K) \u2282 J(K). The set X then contains C(K), and using Thm. 6.6, we get the bound as given, noting that fC/kv (r(C)) \u2264 2r(C) by\nLemma 3.1.\n\u0003\n7. Proof of the main result\nNow we want to apply this machine to prove our main result. We continue to use\nthe notations set in the previous sections. In particular, we will always assume\nthat v(#\u0393) = 0, i.e., that p does not divide the order of \u0393, where p is the residue\ncharacteristic of K.\nRecall that a cocycle class in H 1 (K, \u0393) is called ramified when it has nontrivial\nimage in H 1 (K unr , \u0393), where K unr is the maximal unramified extension of K.\nProposition 7.1. Let C/K be a curve with good reduction, and let C\u03be be a \u0393twist of C such that \u03be is ramified. Let L/K be a finite extension such that C and\nC\u03be become isomorphic over L, and let C be a model of C over O that has good\nreduction. Then the image of C\u03be (K) in Cs (kL ) consists of points fixed under t(\u03be),\nthe type of \u03be.\nProof. Let \u03c6 : C\u03be /L \u2212\u2192 C/L be an isomorphism, and let (\u03be\u03c3 ) be the associated\ncocycle \u03be\u03c3 = \u03c6\u03c3 \u03c6\u22121 taking values in \u0393. We have t(\u03be) = \u03be(IK ) 6= {1}, and for all\n\u03b3 = \u03be\u03c3 \u2208 t(\u03be) (for some \u03c3 \u2208 IK ) and all points P \u2208 C\u03be (K), we have (indicating\nimages in Cs by putting a bar above the point)\n\u03b3(\u03c6(P )) = \u03b3(\u03c6(P )) = \u03c6\u03c3 (P ) = \u03c6(P \u03c3\u22121 )\u03c3 = \u03c6(P \u03c3\u22121 ) = \u03c6(P ) ,\nso \u03c6(P ) is fixed by \u03b3. The last two equalities use that \u03c3 acts trivially both on Cs\nand on P .\n\u0003\nCorollary 7.2. Let C/K be a curve with good reduction, and let C\u03be be a \u0393-twist\nof C such that \u03be is ramified. Assume that v(#\u0393) = 0 and that C \u0393-triv(K\u0304) = \u2205 (or\njust C t(\u03be) (K\u0304) = \u2205). Then C\u03be (K) = \u2205.\nProof. Let L be as in Prop. 7.1. The condition v(#\u0393) = 0, together with good\nt(\u03be)\nreduction, implies that C t(\u03be) (L) \u2192 Cs (kL ) is a bijection. Since by assumption,\nt(\u03be)\nt(\u03be)\nC t(\u03be) (L) is empty, so is Cs (kL ). Since by Prop. 7.1, C\u03be (K) maps into Cs (kL ),\nC\u03be (K) must be empty.\n\u0003\nIf we apply this to curves over number fields, we get the following well-known\nresult. (This goes back to Chevalley and Weil [CW32].)\n\n\fINDEPENDENCE OF RATIONAL POINTS\n\n15\n\nTheorem 7.3. Let D \u2212\u2192 C be an unramified cover of curves over a number\nfield K that is geometrically Galois with Galois group \u0393. Then for all but finitely\nmany twists D \u2032 \u2212\u2192 C of this cover, D \u2032 (K) is empty. More strongly, only finitely\nmany twists have points everywhere locally.\nProof. All but finitely many twists are ramified at some place v with v(#\u0393) = 0\nand such that D has good reduction at v. For such a twist, Cor. 7.2 shows that\nalready D \u2032 (Kv ) is empty. Note that the twists of the cover are exactly the \u0393-twists\nof D and that D \u0393-triv is empty, since we assume the cover to be unramified.\n\u0003\nNow let us proceed to prove Thm 4.3. Note that the assumptions are preserved if\nwe replace K by an unramified extension. We can therefore assume that K \u2032 = K.\nThere is a finite extension L/K such that C and C\u03be are isomorphic over L, which\ncan be taken to be the fixed field of {\u03c3 \u2208 GK | \u03be\u03c3 = 1}. Then eL/K = #t(\u03be),\nand so vL (p) = #t(\u03be)v(p). We apply Thm. 6.6 with the field L and the group\nG \u2282 J\u03be (K) \u0592\u2192 J(L). As before, let C be a model of C over O with good reduction.\nThen X is the set of points in C(L) mapping into the saturation \u1e20 of G, and X is\nthe image of X in Cs (kL ). By Prop. 7.1, the set X consists of fixed points of t(\u03be)\nin Cs (kL ). Now Thm. 6.6 says\n#X \u2264 #X + fC/k (r) + \u2206w (#X , fC/k (r)) ,\nwhere w = vL is the normalised valuation of L. Now eL = #t(\u03be)eK = #t(\u03be)v(p),\nso we have p > fC/k (r) + eL + 1, which gives the better bound\n#X \u2264 #X + fC/k (r) .\nIn the following, we will identify T with its image in C(L), so T \u2282 X. We have\nv(#\u0393) = 0. This implies that each point P \u2208 Cs (kL )t(\u03be) lifts to a (unique) point\nP\u0303 \u2208 DP \u2229 C t(\u03be) (L). Such a point will belong to X if it belongs to T or if it is\ntorsion. Hence\n#X \u2264 #Cst(\u03be) (kL ) = #C t(\u03be) (L) \u2264 #(C t(\u03be) (L) \\ (T \u222a Ctors )) + #(X \u2229 C t(\u03be) (L)) .\nTherefore\n#T \u2264 #(X \\ C t(\u03be) (L)) + #(T \u2229 C t(\u03be) (L))\n= #X \u2212 #(X \u2229 C t(\u03be) (L)) + #(T \u2229 C t(\u03be) (L))\n\u2264 fC/k (r) + #X \u2212 #(X \u2229 C t(\u03be) (L)) + #(T \u2229 C t(\u03be) (L))\n\u2264 fC/k (r) + #(T \u2229 C t(\u03be) (L)) + #(C t(\u03be) (L) \\ (T \u222a Ctors ))\n\u2264 fC/k (r) + #(T \u2229 F\u03be ) + #(F\u03be \\ (T \u222a C\u03be,tors ))\nas it was stated in Thm. 4.3. Note that in the last line, we have used the identification of C\u03be (L) and C(L) given by the isomorphism of C\u03be and C over L in order\nto transfer the result back to C\u03be .\n\n\f16\n\nMICHAEL STOLL\n\nReferences\n[CHM97] L.
