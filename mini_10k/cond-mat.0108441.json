INTRODUCTION\n\nProblems of evolution of non-equilibrium statistical systems attract attention in many areas of physics. These\nproblems are of particular interest for configurational alloy kinetics-the evolution of the atomic distribution in\nnon-equilibrium alloys. The microstructure and macroscopic properties of such alloys, e.g. strength and plasticity,\ndepend crucially on their thermal and mechanical history-for example, on the kinetic path taken during phase\ntransformations. Theoretical treatments of these problems usually employ either Monte Carlo simulation-see e.g.1 -\nor phenomenological kinetic equations for local concentrations and order parameters2\u20134 . However, Monte Carlo\nstudies in this field are time consuming, and until now they provided a limited information on the details of the\nmicrostructural evolution. Use of the phenomenological kinetic equations is more feasible, and Khachaturyan and coworkers2\u20134 used this approach as a basis for discussing many microstructural effects. However, the phenomenological\napproach employs a number of unclear approximations-in particular, the extrapolation of linear Onsager equations\nfor weakly nonequilibrium states to the nonlinear region of states far from equilibrium, and the relation between the\nphenomenological and microscopic approaches is often unclear.\nA consistent description of non-equilibrium alloys can be based on the fundamental master equation for the probabilities of various atomic distributions over lattice sites. The idea to employ this equation for studies of phase\ntransformations was first suggested by Martin5 . For the last decade this approach has been formulated in terms\nof both approximate and exact kinetic equations6\u201312 and was applied to many concrete problems6\u201320 . In this paper we describe the main ideas and methods of this approach and illustrate them with an application to studies of\nmicrostructural evolution under L10 (CuAu I)-type orderings in FCC alloys.\nII. EXACT RELATIONS\n\nFollowing Ref. 9 we consider a substitutional alloy that includes atoms of m species p = p1 , p2 , . . . pm , in particular,\nvacancies for which p=v. Various distributions of atoms over lattice sites i are described by the different occupation\nnumber sets {npi } where the operator npi is unity when the site i is occupied by a p-species atom and zero otherwise.\nFor each i the sum of operators npi over all species p is unity, thus only m \u2212 1 of them are independent. It is\nconvenient to mark the independent operators with special symbols, e.g. with greek letters: (npi )indep = n\u03b1i , while\nthe rest operator denoted as nri is expressed via n\u03b1i :\nX\nnri = 1 \u2212\nn\u03b1i .\n(1)\n\u03b1\n\nThe configurationally dependent part of energy H t can be written as\nX\nX pq\npqr\nVij npi nqj +\nVijk\nnpi nqj nrk + . . .\nHt =\npq,i>j\n\n(2)\n\npqr,i>j>k\n\nAfter elimination of the operators nri according to (1) Eq. (2) yields the interaction Hamiltonian H in terms of only\nindependent operators n\u03b1i :\n\n1\n\n\fH=\n\nX\n\n\u03b1\u03b2\nvij\nn\u03b1i n\u03b2j + +\n\n\u03b1\u03b2,i>j\n\nX\n\n\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\nvijk\nn\u03b1i n\u03b2j n\u03b3k + . . .\n\n(3)\n\n\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3,i>j>k\n\n\u03b1...\u03b2\np...q\nwhere effective interactions vi...j\nare linearly expressed via Vi...j\nin (2).\nThe fundamental master equation for the probability P to find the occupation number set {n\u03b1i } = \u03be is\nX\ndP (\u03be)/dt =\n[W (\u03be, \u03b7)P (\u03b7) \u2212 W (\u03b7, \u03be)P (\u03be)]\n\n(4)\n\n\u03b7\n\nwhere W (\u03be, \u03b7) is the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03be transition probability per unit time. Adopting for this probabilitiy the conventional\n\"thermally activated atomic exchange model\"5,6 , we can express W (\u03be, \u03b7) in (4) in terms of the probabilitiy Wijpq of\nan inter-site atomic exchange (\"jump\") qj \u2194 pi per unit time:\npq\npq\ns\nin\nin\nWijpq = npi nqj \u03c9ij\nexp[\u2212\u03b2(Epi,qj\n\u2212 Epi,qj\n)] \u2261 npi nqj \u03b3ij\nexp(\u03b2Epi,qj\n).\n\n(5)\n\npq\ns\nHere \u03c9ij\nand Epi,qj\nare the \"attempt frequency\" and the \"saddle point energy\" assumed to be independent of alloy\nin\nconfiguration; \u03b2 = 1/T is the reciprocal temperature; Epi,qj\nis the initial (before the jump) configurational energy of\npq\npq\ns\njumping atoms, and \u03b3ij = \u03c9ij exp[\u2212\u03b2(Epi,qj )] is the configurationally independent factor in the jump probability.\nIf we accept for simplicity the pair interaction model, i.e. retain only the first term in Eq. (2), then the operator\nin\nEpi,qj\nin (5) may be expressed in terms of formal variational derivatives of the hamiltonian (2) over npi and nqj ,\nt\nt\nHpi = \u03b4H t /\u03b4npi and Hpi,qj\n= \u03b4 2 H t /\u03b4npi \u03b4nqj :\nin\nt\nt\nt\nEpi,qj\n= npi Hpi\n+ nqj Hqj\n\u2212 npi nqj Hpi,qj\n,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the last term corresponds to the substraction of the \"double-counted\" interaction between the jumping atoms.\npq\nThe employed neglection of a possible configurational dependence of \u03b3ij\nin (5) is actually not essential, and one can\npq\nalso use any form of Wij obeying the detailed balance principle.\nIt has been shown in9 that in studies of practically interesting problems the true vacancy-mediated atomic exchange\nmechanism can usually be replaced by some equivalent direct exchange model. For example, instead of a real binary\nalloy ABv with vacancies and the vacancy-mediated atomic exchanges A\u2194v and B\u2194v we can consider a more simple\nmodel of a binary alloy AB with the direct A\u2194B exchange and only one independent variable nAi \u2261 ni in Eqs. (3)\u2013(6)\nfor each site i. Discussing below for simplicity only the binary alloy case we can seek the distribution function P (\u03be)\nin (4) in the form of a \"generalized Gibbs distribution\":\nX\n\u03bbi ni \u2212 Q)].\n(7)\nP {ni } = exp[\u03b2(\u03a9 +\ni\n\nHere the operator Q is an analogue of the Hamiltonian H in (3):\nX\nX\naij ni nj +\naijk ni nj nk + . . . ;\nQ=\ni>j\n\n(8)\n\ni>j>k\n\nthe \"local chemical potentials\" \u03bbi and \"quasi-interactions\" ai...j (being, generally, both time and space dependent)\nare the parameters of the distribution; and the generalized grand canonical potential \u03a9 = \u03a9{\u03bbi , gi...j } is determined\nby the normalizing condition:\nX\n\u03a9 = \u2212T ln Tr exp[\u03b2(\n\u03bbi ni \u2212 Q)].\n(9)\ni\n\nMultiplying equation (4) by operators ni , ni nj , etc., and summing over all configurational states, i.e. over all number\nsets {ni }, we obtain the set of equations for the averages gij...k = hni nj . . . nk i \u2261 Tr(ni nj . . . nk P ), in particular, for\nthe mean occupation ci = hni i = gi .

Eqs. (16) are the usual Gibbs relations for the parameters \u03bbi and ai...j in the\ndistribution (7) for the stationary case.\nIII. KINETIC MEAN-FIELD AND KINETIC CLUSTER APPROXIMATIONS\n\nTo approximately solve kinetic equations (10) one can use the regular approximate methods of statistical physics,\nsuch as the mean-field approximation (MFA), the cluster variation method (CVM)21,22 , and also its simplified version,\nthe cluster field method (CFM)23 . In both the kinetic MFA and kinetic CFM (KMFA and KCFM) the equations for\nci (t) are separated from those for gi...j (t) and have the form8\u201310 :\nX\nMij sinh[\u03b2(Fj \u2212 Fi )/2]\n(17)\ndci /dt = 2\nj\n\nwhere Fi = \u03bbi = \u2202F/\u2202ci , while Mij = Mij {ck } and F = F {ci } is the MFA or CFM expression for the generalised\nmobility and the free energy of a nonuniform alloy. For simplest approximations, such as the KMFA or the kinetic paircluster approximation (KPCA), these expressions can be written analytically. For example, the KMFA expressions\nfor Mij and Fi in an alloy with only pair interactions Vijpq in (2) are\n\"\n#\nq\n\u03b2X\n\u2032\n\u2032\nMij = \u03b3ij ci ci cj cj exp\n(uik + ujk )ck ;\n2\nk\n\nFi = ln\n\nci X\n+\nvik ck .\nc\u2032i\n\n(18)\n\nk\n\nHere c\u2032i = 1 \u2212 ci , and uik = VikAA \u2212 VikBB is the \"asymmetrical potential\"5 . Substituting Eqs. (18) into (17) we obtain\nthe analytical KMFA equation for ci (t). A similar equation is obtained in the KPCA9 .\nThe usual phenomenological kinetic equations, in particular, those used by Khachaturyan and coworkers2\u20134 , correspond to the linearization of the KCFM equations (17) in (Fi \u2212 Fj ) and neglecting the ci -dependence in the mobility\nMij . Such approach is usually sufficient for qualitative considerations, but for some problems it can lead to a notable\ndistortion of both the time scale and other details of the microstructural evolution14 .\nKMFA or KCPA are usually sufficient for studies of main kinetic features of spinodal decomposition, as well as\norderings in the BCC lattice13\u201318 . However, for more complex orderings, e.g. L12 and L10 orderings in the FCC\nlattice, MFA and PCA are known to be insufficient and more precise methods are necessary, such as the CVM or\n3\n\n\fCFM21\u201323 . Recently we suggested a simplified version of CVM, the tetrahedron cluster field method (TCFM)23 , that\ncombines a high accuracy of CVM in describing thermodynamics with great simplification of calculations making it\nposible to develop its kinetic generalization, KTCFM10 . Similarly to the KMFA and KPCA, the KTCFM provides\nexplicit equations for the mobility Mij and the local chemical potential Fi in Eq. (17) via mean occupations ck , and\nfor each site i these equations can be reduced to a system of four nonlinear algebraic equations which can easily be\nsolved using Newton's method.\nLet us now make remarks about effective interactions vi...j in the Hamiltonian (3) for real alloys. These interactions\nc\ninclude the \"chemical\" contributions vi...j\nwhich describe the energy changes under permutations of atoms A and B in\nd\nthe rigid lattice, and the \"deformational\" interactions vi...j\nrelated to the lattice deformations under such permutations.\nThe chemical contributions are estimated from either first-principle calculations or fitting to some experimental data22 ,\nbut for the long-ranged deformational interactions such methods can not be directly used. A microscopical model for v d\nin dilute alloys which includes only one experimental parameter was suggested by Khachaturyan2. The deformational\ninteraction in concentrated alloys can lead to some new effects being absent in dilute alloys, for example, to the lattice\nsymmetry changes under phase transformations, such as the tetragonal distortion under L10 ordering, and earlier\nthese effects were described only phenomenologically3. Recently we suggested a microscopical model for calculations\nof v d in concentrated alloys11 which generalizes the Khachaturyan's approach2. Unlike the case of dilute alloys, this\ndeformational interaction turns out to be essentially non-parwise, and it includes two parameters which can be found\nfrom experimental data about the lattice distortion under phase transformations.\nIV. METHODS OF SIMULATION OF L10 ORDERING\n\nUp to recently most of theoretical treatments of kinetics of alloy ordering considered only simplest B2 (CuZntype) orderings with just two types of antiphase-ordered domain (APD) and one type of antiphase boundary (APB)\nseparating these APDs. Yet ordered structures in real alloys are usually more complex and include many types of\nAPD. For example, under the D03 (Fe3 Al-type) ordering on the BCC lattice there are four types of APD18 , while\nunder the L12 (Cu3 Au-type) or L10 ordering on the FCC lattice there are four or six types of APD, respectively.\nIt results in a number of peculiar kinetic features that are absent for the simple B2 ordering. In Refs. 18,10 we\ndiscussed such features for the D03 and L12 -type orderings. Below we consider the L10 -type orderings for which the\nmicrostructural evolution turns out to be still more complex and interesting.\nTo study this evolution we made simulations of A1\u2192L10 transformations after a quench of an alloy from the\ndisordered A1 phase to the single-phase L10 state. For these simulations we used the master equation approach\nand the KTCFM described above. We considered five alloy models with different types of chemical interaction:\nthe second-neighbor (or \"short-range\") interaction models 1, 2, and 3 with v1 = 1000 K and the ratio v2 /v1 equal\nto (-0.125), (-0.25) and (-0.5), respectively; the \"intermediate-range\" fourth-neighbor-interaction model 4 with vn\nestimated by Chassagne et al.24 from their experimental data for Ni\u2013Al alloys: v1 = 1680 K, v2 = \u2212210 K, v3 = 35 K,\nand v4 = \u2212207 K; and the \"extended-range\" fourth-neighbor-interaction model 5 with v1 = 1000 K, v2 /v1 = \u22120.5,\nv3 /v1 = 0.25, and v4 /v1 = \u22120.125. The deformational interaction v d for all these models was estimated as described in\nsection 3 with the use of experimental data for Co-Pt alloys. The critical temperature Tc for our models corresponds to\nthe stoichiometric composition c = 0.5 and is 614, 840, 1290, 1950 and 2280 K for model 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively.\nThe distribution of mean occupations ci under alloy ordering can be described in terms of both long-ranged and\nlocal order parameters. For the homogeneous L12 or L10 ordering the distribution ci = c(Ri ) (where Ri is the FCC\nlattice vector) can be written in terms of three long-ranged order parameters \u03b7\u03b1 , see e. g.2 :\nci = c + \u03b71 exp(ik1 Ri ) + \u03b72 exp(ik2 Ri ) + \u03b73 exp(ik3 Ri )\n\n(19)\n\nwhere k\u03b1 is the superstructure vector corresponding to \u03b7\u03b1 : {k1 , k2 , k3 } = {[100], [010], [001]}2\u03c0/a. For the cubic L12\nstructure |\u03b71 | = |\u03b72 | = |\u03b73 |, \u03b71 \u03b72 \u03b73 > 0, and four types of ordered domain are possible. In the L10 -ordered structure\nwith the tetragonal axis \u03b1, a single non-zero parameter \u03b7\u03b1 is present which is either positive or negative. Therefore, six\ntypes of ordered domains are possible with two types of APB. That separation of two APDs with the same tetragonal\naxis will be for brevity called the \"shift-APB\", and that separation of the APDs with perpendicular tetragonal axes\nwill be called the \"flip-APB\". The transient partially ordered alloy states can be conveniently described in terms of\n2\nlocal squared order parameters \u03b7\u03b1i\ndefined in10 . The simulation results in figures 1\u20135 below are usually presented as\n2\n2\n2\n2\nthe distributions of quantities \u03b7i = \u03b71i\n+ \u03b72i\n+ \u03b73i\n(to be called the \"\u03b7 2 \u2013representation\"): the grey level linearly varies\n2\nwith \u03b7i between its minimum and maximum values from completely dark to completely bright, and this distribution\nis similar to that observed in the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images25\u201329 .\nThe simulations were performed in FCC simulation boxes of sizes Vb = L2 \u00d7 H (where L and H are given in units\nof the lattice constant a) with periodic boundary conditions. We used both 3D simulations with H = L and quasi-2D\n4\n\n\fsimulations with H = 1, and all significant features of evolution in both types of simulation were found to be similar.\nEach of figures 1\u20135 below includes all FCC lattice sites lying in two adjacent planes, z = 0 and z = a/2, thus it shows\n4L2 lattice sites. The initial as-quenched distribution ci (0) was characterized by its mean value c and small random\nfluctuations \u03b4ci ; usually we used \u03b4ci = \u00b10.01.\nV. KINETICS OF A1\u2192L10 TRANSFORMATION\n\nTo avoid discussing the problems of nucleation, in this work we consider the transformation temperatures T lower\nthan the ordering spinodal temperature Ts . Then the evolution under the A1\u2192L10 transition includes the following\nstages25\u201328 :\n(i) The initial stage of the formation of finest L10 -ordered domains when their tetragonal distortion still has little\neffect on the evolution and all six types of APD are present in microstructures in the same proportion.\n(ii) The imtermediate stage which corresponds to the so-called \"tweed\" contrast in TEM images. The tetragonal\ndeformation of the L10 phase here leads to a predominance of the (110)-oriented flip-APBs in the microstructures,\nbut all six types of APD are still present in similar proportions.\n(iii) The final, \"twin\" stage when the tetragonal distortion of the L10 -ordered APDs becomes the main factor\ndetermining the evolution and leads to the formation of the (110)-type oriented bands. Each band includes only two\ntypes of APD with the same tetragonal axis, and these axes in the adjacent bands are \"twin\" related, i.e. have the\nalternate (100) and (010) orientations for the given set of the (110)-oriented bands.\nThe thermodynamic driving force for the (100)-type orientation of flip-APBs is the gain in the elastic energy of\nthe adjacent APDs: at other orientations this energy increases under the growth of an APD proportionally to its\nvolume2,19 . For an APD with the characteristic size l, surface Sd , tetragonal deformation \u03b5, and shear constant\nv\ncs , this force begins to affect the microstructural evolution when the volume elastic energy Eel\n\u223c cs \u03b52 lSd becomes\ncomparable with the surface energy Es \u223c \u03c3Sd where \u03c3 is the APB surface energy. The beginning of the tweed stage\nv\n\u223c Es or to the characteristic APD size\n(ii) corresponds to the relation Eel\nl0 \u223c \u03c3/cs \u03b52 .\n\n(20)\n\nThe distortion \u03b5 is proportional to the order parameter squared19 , and below it is characterized by its maximum value\n\u03b5m corresponding to T = 0 and c = 0.5.\nSome results of our simulations are presented in figures 1\u20135. The symbol A or A, B or B and C or C in these\nfigures corresponds to an L10 -ordered domain with the tetragonal axis along (100), (010) and (001) and the positive\nor negative value of the order parameter \u03b71 , \u03b72 and \u03b73 , respectively. Frame 2d is shown in the \u03b722 -representation: the\n2\ngrey level linearly varies with \u03b72i\nbetween its minimum and maximum from completely dark to completely bright,\nwhich corresponds to the usual bright-field TEM images25\u201329 .\n\n5\n\n\fFIG. 1. Temporal evolution of the extended\u2013range-interaction model 5 under the phase transformation A1\u2192L10 shown in\nthe \u03b7 2 -representation for the simulation box size Vb = 1282 \u00d7 1 at c = 0.5, the reduced temperature T \u2032 = T /Tc = 0.7, |\u03b5m | = 0.1\nand the following values of the reduced time t\u2032 = t\u03b3ij : (a) 10; (b) 20; (c) 50; (d) 100; (e) 250; and (f) 280. The symbol A, A,\nB, B, C or C indicates the type of the ordered domain as described in the text. The single, the double and the thick arrow\nindicates the splitting APB process, the quadruple junction of APDs, and the fusion-of-domain process, respectively, mentioned\nin the text.\n\nFIG. 2. As figure 1, but at |\u03b5m | = 0.15 and the following values of t\u2032 : (a) 10; (b) 20; (c) 50; (d) 150; (e) 172; and (f) 350.\nFrame 2d is shown in the \u03b722 -representation described in the text.\n\n6\n\n\fFigures 1\u20135 illustrate quasi-2D simulations for which microstructures include only the edge-on APBs normal to the\n(001) plane. The above-mentioned elimination of the volume-dependent elastic energy in such geometry is possible\nonly for the (100) and (010)-ordered APDs A or A and B or B separated by the (110)-oriented flip-APB, while in\nthe (001)-oriented domains C and C this elastic energy is always present. Therefore, the tweed stage (ii) in these\nsimulations corresponds to both the predominance of (110)-oriented APBs and the decrease of the number of domains\nC and C in the microstructures.\n\nFIG. 3. As figure 2, but for the intermediate-range-interaction model 4 at T \u2032 = 0.67 and the following values of t\u2032 : (a) 10;\n(b) 20; (c) 50; (d) 170; (e) 200; and (f) 700.\n\nLet us first consider figures 1\u20133 in which frames 1a\u20131b, 2a and 3a correspond to the initial stage; frames 1c\u20131d,\n2b\u20132c, and 3b\u20133c, to the tweed stage; and the rest frames, to the twin stage. At both the initial and the tweed stage\nwe can observe the following features of evolution20 :\n(a) The presence of abundant processes of fusion of in-phase domains which are one of the main mechanisms of\ndomain growth at these stages.\n(b) The presence of peculiar long-living configurations, the quadruple junctions of APDs (4-junctions) of the type\nA1 A2 A1 A3 where A2 and A3 can correspond to any two of four types of APD different from A1 and A1 .\n(c) The presence of many processes of \"splitting\" of a shift-APB into two flip-APBs which is finished by either a\nfusion of in-phase domains mentioned in point (a) (s \u2192 f process), or a formation of a 4-junction mentioned in point\n(b) (s \u2192 4j process).\nFor example, s \u2192 f processes can be followed in frames 1a\u20131b; 1c\u20131d; 1d\u20131e; 2c\u20132d; etc. The fusion with the\ndisappearance of an intermediate APD which initially separates two in-phase domains to be fused20 can be seen in\nthe lower right part of frames 1a\u20131b. Several long-living 4-junctions are seen in frames 1a\u20131d and 2c\u20132d; and an\ns \u2192 4j process can be followed in the lower right part of frames 1a\u20131c. Let us also note that the microstructural\nfeatures (b) and (c) can be naturally explained by a significant excess of the surface energy of shift-APBs with respect\nto flip-APBs found in our CFM calculations for the systems under consideration.\nFrames 3a\u20133c also display some (100)-oriented and thin \"conservative\" APBs10,20 . Such APBs are most typical of\nthe short-range-interaction systems-see10 and figure 4 below-where they have a low surface energy (being zero for\nthe nearest-neighbor interaction model). Under an increase of the interaction range (as well as temperature or the\ndeviation from stoichiometric composition \u03b4c = 0.5 \u2212 c) the anisotropy of this surface energy decreases, and so for\nmodel 4 such APBs are few, while for the extended-range-interaction model 5 they are absent at all.\nFrames 1c\u20131d, 2b\u20132c, and 3b\u20133c (as well as 4a\u20134b) illustrate a (110)-type alignment of APBs between APDs A\nor A and B or B and a \"dying out\" of APDs C and C at the tweed stage. Frames 1c and 1d also show that in the\n7\n\n\fsimulation with a realistic distortion parameter |\u03b5m | = 0.1 (fitted to the structural data for CoPt) the APD size l0\n(20) characteristic of the tweed stage is about (20 \u2212 40) a. It agrees with the order of magnitude of l0 observed in the\nCoPt-type alloys FePt and FePd26,27 .\nDiscussing the final, twin stage of the evolution we first mention some characteristic configurations observed in\nexperimental studies of transient twinned microstructures3,26\u201329 :\n(1) \"semi-loop\" shift-APBs adjacent to the twin band boundaries;\n(2) \"S-shaped\" shift-APBs stretching across the twin band;\n(3) short and narrow twin bands-usually with one or two shift-APBs near their edges\u2013lying within the main twin\nbands;\n(4) an alignment of shift-APBs in the final, \"nearly equilibrium\" twin bands: within a (100) oriented band in a\n(110)-type polytwin the APBs tend to align normally to some direction n = (cos \u03b1, sin \u03b1, 0) with a \"tilting\" angle \u03b1\nwhich is less than \u03c0/4 in CoPt and is close to zero in CuAu28,29 .\nComparing our results with experiments one should consider that due to the limited size of the simulation box the\ntwin band width d in our simulations has the same order of magnitude as the APD size l0 (20) characteristic of the\ntweed stage, while in experiments d usually much exceeds l0 26\u201329 . Therefore, the distribution of shift-APBs within\ntwin bands in our simulation is usually much more close to equilibrium than in experiments. In spite of this difference,\nthe simulations reproduce not only \"nearly equilibrium\" configurations (4) but also transient configurations (1)\u2013(3)\nand elucidate their formation mechanisms. In particular, both the \"semi-loop\" and \"S-shaped\" shift-APBs are formed\nfrom regular-shaped approximately quadrangular APDs (characteristic of early twin stages) due to the disappearance\nof adjacent APDs which are \"wrongly-oriented\" with respect to the given twin band; it is seen, for example, in frames\n1d\u20131f, 2e\u20132f, 3c\u20133e, etc. The formation of short and narrow twin bands with the edges touched by shift-APBs is\nillustrated by frame 2d (which is strikingly similar to the experimental microstructure shown in Fig. 2 of Ref. 3) and\nalso by frame 3d.\nThe alignment of shift-APBs mentioned in point (4) is illustrated by frames 2f and 3f, as well as 4d and 5a\u20135d.\nThese frames show that the tilting angle \u03b1 sharply depends on the interaction type, particularly on the interaction\nrange, as well as on the concentration c and temperature T . In particular, for the extended-range-interaction model\n5 this angle is close to \u03c0/4; for the intermediate-range-interaction model 4 (which seems to more realistically describe\nproperties of CoPt-type alloys) the angle \u03b1 is less than \u03c0/4, i.e. APB planes are tilted to the tetragonality axis;\nand for the short-range-interaction models 1 and 2 the APB planes tend to be parallel with the tetragonality axis, i.\ne. \u03b1 \u2243 0. Such interaction-dependent alignment of shift-APBs can be explained19 by the competition between the\nanisotropy of their surface energy - which for both the intermediate and short-ranged-interaction systems tends to\norient APBs parallel with the tetragonality axis decreasing the angle \u03b1, and a tendency to minimize the APB area\nwithin the given twin band which corresponds to \u03b1 = \u03c0/4. Therefore, the comparison of experimental tilting angles\nwith the theoretical calculations19 can provide both qualitative and quantitative information about the interatomic\ninteractions in an alloy.\n\n8\n\n\fFIG. 4. As figure 2 but for the short-range-interaction model 1 at T \u2032 = 0.9 and the following values of t\u2032 : (a) 30; (b) 40; (c)\n60; and (d) 120.\n\nFigure 4 illustrates evolution for model 1 which describes the short-ranged-interaction systems such as alloys Cu\u2013\nAu10 . The microstructures for such systems include many conservative APBs mentioned above, and the shift-APBs in\nthe final frame 4d are \"step-like\" consisting of (100)-type oriented conservative segments and small non-conservative\nledges (being similar to the APBs observed in the L12 -ordered Cu3 Au alloy10 ). These step-like APBs can be viewed as\na \"facetted\" version of tilted APBs seen in frames 2f, 3f, 5c and 5d. As mentioned, under an increase of temperature\nT or \"non-stoichiometry\" \u03b4c = 0.5 \u2212 c the anisotropy in the APB energy rapidly decreases. It results in sharp, phasetransition-like changes in morphology of aligned APBs, from the \"faceting\" to the \"tilting\", which is illustrated by\nframes 5a\u20135d. These morphological changes are realized via some local bends of facetted APBs illustrated by frames\n5a\u20135b. Therefore, this \"morphological phase transition\" is actually smeared over some intervals of temperature or\nconcentration, but frames 5a\u20135d show that these intervals can be relatively narrow.\n\n9\n\n\fFIG. 5. As figure 1 but for model 2 at |\u03b5m | = 0.1 and the following values of c, T \u2032 and t\u2032 : (a) c = 0.5, T \u2032 = 0.77, t\u2032 = 350;\n(b) c = 0.46, T \u2032 = 0.77, t\u2032 = 350; (c) c = 0.5, T \u2032 = 0.95, t\u2032 = 300; and (d) c = 0.44, T \u2032 = 0.77, t\u2032 = 300.\n\nFinally, let us make a general remark about the kinetics of multivariant orderings in alloys, such as the D03 , L12\nand L10 orderings considered in Refs. 10,18\u201320 and in this work. It is well known that the thermodynamic behavior\nof different systems under various phase transitions reveals features of universality and insensitivity to microscopical\ndetails of structure, particularly in the critical region near thermodynamic instability points. The results of this and\nother studies of multivariant oderings show that such universality does not seem to hold for their phase transformation\nkinetics, anyway outside the critical region (which for such orderings is usually either quite narrow or absent at all).\nThe microstructural evolution reveals a great variety of peculiar features, the detailed form of which sharply depends\non the type of interatomic interaction, structure, the degree of deviation from stoichiometric composition, and other\n\"non-universal\" characteristics.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors are much indebted to Georges Martin for numerous stimulating discussions.
