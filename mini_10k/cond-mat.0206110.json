If we replace E by \u03a8, the\nq\nwavefunction for an electron, k by 2mE/h\u03042 , and n2 by 1 \u2212 V /E, where V is the potential and E is the energy of\nthe electron, we obtain the time independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation for an electron. Hence we see that the effects of\nthe refractive index on electromagnetic waves and the effects of an electrostatic potential on electrons are similar.\nDespite the close similarity between the equations describing the propagation of electromagnetic waves and electrons,\nthere is by no means an exact mapping of properties between the two systems. A particularly tricky topic is the\nabsorption of waves that takes place in the presence of dissipation, particularly for evanescent waves. Continuum\nelectromagnetic theory adds an imaginary part to the dielectric permittivity or the magnetic permeability to model\nthe microscopic processes of absorption.2 An imaginary potential is frequently adopted to model scattering of electrons\ninto inelastic channels1 and is often referred to as an optical potential because of the analogy with electromagnetic\nwaves. Such potentials are extensively used in nuclear physics to describe the scattering events in which particles are\nremoved from the incident flux and to describe the formation of complex nuclei.3\nIt is now possible to fabricate solid-state structures that are small enough for the transport of electrons to be\nlargely coherent so that the wave nature of the electrons dominates. Such systems are known as mesoscopic and their\ncurrent characteristics are modeled using a scattering formalism analogous to that used to calculate the transmission\nof light through one or more slabs of dielectric material.4 The propagation of electrons can be thought of as due\nto contributions from a number of different coherent channels that are essentially coherent wave modes. Complex\npotentials can be used in such systems to describe the removal of electrons from a coherent channel due to inelastic\nscattering processes5 and dephasing6 (scattering out of one wave mode into others and loss of coherence). However,\nalthough it is frequently used, this approach is over simplistic because it neglects the important fact that any potential\n(whether real or imaginary) also gives rise to additional scattering.7\nWe will discuss some aspects of wave propagation in dissipative media that many students (and some teachers)\ndo not appreciate after a first course on quantum mechanics. In Sec. II we begin by discussing the familiar cases\nof propagating and evanescent classical electromagnetic waves in an absorbing medium. In Sec. III, we analyze the\nanalogous case for electrons: propagation in a region with an imaginary contribution to the potential. Such nonunitary Hamiltonians can formally cause the absorption of the particle and are frequently used to mimic absorption.\nWe examine the consequences of an optical potential on both propagating and evanescent electron waves. Then in\nSec. IV we use the example of scattering from a complex delta-function potential to explore the additional scattering\nthat is encountered when using optical potentials in quantum mechanics. In Sec. V, we address the problem of how\n\n\f2\nto construct a maximally absorbing material, a so-called perfect absorber. Intriguingly, a way of maximizing the\nabsorption of light in non-magnetic materials can be derived by analogy with a mesoscopic system. Finally we draw\nconclusions in Sec. VI.\nII.\n\nTHE CASE OF LIGHT\n\nIt is possible to describe the propagation of light through an absorbing medium using a very simple prescription:8\njust add an imaginary part to the refractive index of the medium, n = nr + ini , where ni , the imaginary part of the\nrefractive index, is proportional to the degree of absorption in the medium. The ratio \u03ba = ni /nr is often called the\nattenuation index.8 A complex refractive index implies that the wave vector of a wave in the medium will also be\ncomplex, k \u2261 2\u03c0n/\u03bb = 2\u03c0(nr + ini )/\u03bb, and a propagating wave, eikz (in one dimension), decays in amplitude as it\ntravels through the medium.\nThe imaginary part of n enters the continuum theory as an imaginary component of the dielectric constant.8 A\nmaterial will typically be at least partly absorbing and so the dielectric constant will generally be complex, with\nthe degree of absorption measured by the magnitude of its imaginary component (for non-magnetic materials.9 ) The\nrefractive index is given by\np\n\u221a\nn = c \u03bc\u03b5 = c \u03bc(\u03b5r + i\u03b5i )\n(2)\n\u0002\n\u03b5i \u0003\n\u221a\n\u2243 c \u03bc\u03b5r 1 + i\n= nr + ini ,\n(3)\n2\u03b5r\nq\nwhere ni = 2c \u03b5\u03bcr \u03b5i , and we have made the usual assumption that \u03b5i \u226a \u03b5r . The energy flow through the medium\n\nis determined by the magnitude of the time-averaged Poynting vector for the electromagnetic wave, hSit . For a\ndissipative medium,\nr\n\u01eb\nc\nc\n\u2217\n|hSit | =\n|E \u00d7 H | =\n|E0 |2 e\u22124\u03c0ni z/\u03bb ,\n(4)\n8\u03c0\n8\u03c0 \u03bc\n\nwhere z is the distance propagated, |E0 | is the amplitude of the electric field vector associated with the electromagnetic\nwave and H\u2217 is the complex conjugate of H, the magnetic field vector. The decay of the energy flow with distance\ncorresponds to the energy dissipated into the medium (\u223c \u2212dS/dz). The quantity \u03c7 = 4\u03c0ni /\u03bb = 4\u03c0nr \u03ba/\u03bb is called\nthe absorption coefficient.8\n\nFIG. 1: A schematic illustration of total internal reflection. A wave incident on a dielectric medium with a larger dielectric\nconstant at an angle greater than the critical angle, \u03b8 > \u03b8c , results in an exponentially decaying wave in medium 2. The plane\nof incidence is the x-z plane and the electric vector is taken to lie in the plane of polarization (p-polarization).\n\nEvanescent waves occur when the magnitude of the transverse incident wave vector, kk , is larger than the wave vector\nin the medium, k0 = 2\u03c0n/\u03bb. The physics of evanescent waves is readily understood by considering what happens\n\n\f3\nwhen light is shone on a non-absorbing medium at an angle greater than the angle for total internal reflection from a\n(1)\n(1)\nmedium with lower refractive index. The geometry is illustrated in Fig. 1 where a wave with a wave vector [kx , 0, kz ]\n\u0001\n2\n(1)\n(1)\nin medium 1 is incident on medium 2. Maxwell's equations require that (kx )2 + (kz )2 = \u03b51 \u03bc \u03c9c in medium 1 and\n(1)\n(2)\nthe continuity condition at the boundary requires kx = kx = kx . Therefore, if \u03b52 < \u03b51 and kx is sufficiently large,\n\u00012\n(2)\n(2)\n(2)\nkz must become imaginary to satisfy the condition in medium 2, (kx )2 + (kz )2 = \u03b52 \u03bc \u03c9c . This condition\nis the\n\u0001\n\u221a\norigin of total internal reflection as there exists no propagating wave inside medium 2 for kx > \u03b52 \u03bc \u03c9c .\nThe spatial dependence of the electromagnetic field in medium 2 takes the form\neik\n\n(2)\n\n.r\n\n(2)\n\n= eikx\n\nx\u2212|kz(2) |z\n\n,\n\n(5)\n\nand the amplitude of the wave decays exponentially with distance into the medium. However, in this case the decay\nof the wave amplitude does not imply the absorption of the wave energy because examination of the Poynting vector\nshows that no energy enters medium 2. Evanescent waves are the classic example of a wave in which exponential\ndecay of the amplitude does not imply that dissipation is taking place.\nThe electromagnetic near-field of a radiation source and the electromagnetic fields inside a metal or plasma are\nalso evanescent.8 The case of the field inside a metal or plasma is interesting because the dielectric constant is large,\nis almost entirely real, but with a negative sign. A negative dielectric constant makes it impossible to satisfy the\n\u00012\ndispersion relation, kx2 + ky2 + kz2 = \u03b5\u03bc \u03c9c , without making at least one component of the wave vector imaginary.\nSuch a medium cannot support propagating waves at all and the wave amplitudes always decay exponentially with\ndistance inside the medium. If the dielectric constant is a purely real and negative number, then the Poynting vector\nis identically zero, corresponding to a dissipationless metal. Purely evanescent waves do not transmit energy, and so\ncannot give rise to dissipation.\nThings become a little more complicated if the medium supporting the evanescent wave has a dielectric constant\nwhich has not only a real part that is negative, but also a small imaginary part corresponding to absorption in the\nmedium. In this case the magnetic field associated with the wave in the medium takes the form (assuming that the\nelectric field of the incident radiation lies in the plane of incidence),\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\nH(r, t) = [0 1 0]H0 eikx x\u2212kz z\u2212ikz z\u2212i\u03c9t ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere [0 1 0] denotes a unit vector in the y-direction. Because we are dealing with an evanescent mode with kx2 >\n\u0001\n\u03c9 2\nRe[\u03b5\u03bc], we have made the transformation kz \u2192 ikz with real and imaginary parts kz\u2032 and kz\u2032\u2032 , respectively. The\nc\nelectric field can be obtained from Maxwell's equation, ck \u00d7 H = \u2212\u03c9eE. Although the imaginary part of the dielectric\nconstant does not affect the amplitude of the evanescent wave, it induces a phase shift as a function of the distance\ninto the medium (that is, the z-direction). The Poynting vector is now finite and given by\ni c2 |H |2\nh\n\u2032\n0\nhSit = \u03b5r kx , 0, \u03b5r kz\u2032\u2032 + \u03b5i kz\u2032\ne\u22122kz z ,\n8\u03c0\u03c9|\u03b5|2\nq\n\u00012\nwhere \u03b5 = \u03b5r + i\u03b5i . Because kz = kx2 \u2212 \u03b5\u03bc \u03c9c , we see that\n\u03bc\u03b5i (\u03c9/c)2\n,\nkz\u2032\u2032 \u2243 \u2212 p\n2 kx2 \u2212 \u03b5r \u03bc(\u03c9/c)2\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nthat is, kz\u2032\u2032 \u221d \u03b5i . In other words, the Poynting vector is only finite if \u03b5i 6= 0. Hence the energy dissipation (\u223c \u2212dS/dz)\narises, as before, from the imaginary part of the dielectric constant although the exponential decay of the Poynting\nvector is due to the real part.\nThe roles of the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant in affecting the amplitude of an evanescent wave\nare the opposite of those for a propagating wave. The decay in the amplitude of an evanescent wave is due to the\nreal (and perhaps, negative) part of the dielectric constant. In contrast, the imaginary part of the dielectric constant,\nto first order in \u03b5i , only causes a phase shift with respect to the distance into the medium. This phase shift can be\nmeasured experimentally under suitable conditions.10 The phase shift as a function of position is crucial: it means\nthat the Poynting vector of the evanescent wave is finite and energy is absorbed by the medium.\nIII.\n\nTHE CASE OF ELECTRONS\n\nMatter waves, like electrons, are described by a wave function which, for non-relativistic energies, satisfies the unitary\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation. The unitarity of Schr\u00f6dinger's equation implies that probability is preserved. This condition\n\n\f4\nreflects the fact that massive particles, in contrast to photons, cannot be physically absorbed. However, in mesoscopic\nsystems there are many situations in which electrons in one coherent channel are scattered inelastically due to electronelectron and electron-phonon interactions into other channels.4 Thus when the transmission through the coherent\nchannel is measured using an interferometer, it appears as if the electrons in the specified channel are absorbed. To\ndescribe this problem completely, a substantial generalization of the usual scattering formalism would be required to\ninclude all relevant interactions and processes. However, the problem can be simplified dramatically by modeling the\napparent absorption of electrons using a phenomenological approach based on an imaginary potential.5,6,11\nImaginary potentials are often introduced in the context of scattering theory and the optical theorem.1 The presence\nof an imaginary potential destroys the unitarity of Schr\u00f6dinger's equation. For a complex potential of the form\nV (r) = Vr (r) \u2212 iVi (r) (with Vi (r) a positive definite function), the equation of motion for a wavepacket \u03a8(r, t) is\nih\u0304\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2202\u03a8(r, t)\nh\u03042 2\n=\u2212\n\u2207 \u03a8(r, t) + Vr (r) \u2212 iVi (r) \u03a8(r, t).\n\u2202t\n2m\n\n(9)\n\nThe importance of the minus sign in the potential becomes apparent from the equation of motion for the probability\ndensity, P (r, t) = \u03a8\u2217 (r, t)\u03a8(r, t),\n2Vi\n\u2202P (r, t)\n+ \u2207 * S(r, t) = \u2212\nP (r, t),\n\u2202t\nh\u0304\n\n(10)\n\nwhere S is the particle flux. The imaginary potential clearly acts as a sink for particles.\nThe imaginary potential in the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be eliminated by writing the wavefunction as \u03a8(r, t) =\nexp(\u2212Vi t/h\u0304)\u03c6(r, t), where \u03c6(r, t) obeys the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in the absence of the imaginary potential. Thus\nan imaginary potential in the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is equivalent to a wavefunction that intrinsically decays in time.\nThus it is not surprising that imaginary potentials have been widely used to construct phenomenological models for\nabsorption in quantum mechanics.\nIf the imaginary potential is spatially uniform, then in the absence of any sources of particles, the decay of probability\nwill be uniform in time. In this case it makes sense to examine the steady-state scattering solutions, that is, solutions\nof the form \u03a8(r, t) = \u03c8(r) exp(\u2212iEt), which obey (in one-dimension) the time-independent wave equation\n\u2212\n\nh\u03042 d2 \u03c8(x)\n+ (Vr \u2212 iVi )\u03c8(x) = E\u03c8(x),\n2m dx2\n\n(11)\n\nwhere E is the energy of the wavefunction. For constant potentials and E > Vr , \u03c8(x), represents propagating waves\nof the form \u03c8 \u223c exp(ikx) = exp(ik \u2032 x \u2212 k \u2032\u2032 x), where\nq\nh\ni\nVi\nk = k \u2032 + ik \u2032\u2032 \u2243 2m(E \u2212 Vr )/h\u03042 1 + i\n,\n(12)\n2(E \u2212 Vr )\nassuming Vi \u226a E \u2212 Vr . The amplitude of the wave decays with distance because of the imaginary component in the\npotential, in close analogy with the optical case where the imaginary part of the dielectric constant causes a wave to\ndecay in amplitude.\nIn the classically forbidden region, where E < Vr , the wavefunction corresponds to tunneling rather than propagation, \u03c8 = \u03c80 exp(\u2212Kx) = \u03c80 exp[\u2212(K \u2032 \u2212 iK \u2032\u2032 )x], where\n\u0014\n\u0015\nq\nVi\n2\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nK = K \u2212 iK = 2m(Vr \u2212 E)/h\u0304 1 \u2212 i\n.\n(13)\n2(Vr \u2212 E)\nThis behavior is like the optical case of evanescent waves: the decay of the wavefunction with distance is controlled\nby the real part of the potential, while the imaginary part of the potential gives rise to just a change in the phase.\nHowever, the phase change is again important because it is responsible for absorption.\nThe absorption that arises from evanescent waves that undergo a position-dependent phase shift is nicely illustrated\nby considering the text-book example of tunneling through a rectangular barrier,1 shown schematically in Fig. 2. If\nthe wave has energy E > V0 so that it is propagating\nthroughout, then the wavefunction inside the barrier region\nq\nis given by \u03c8 = Aeikx + Be\u2212ikx , where k = 2m(E \u2212 V0 )/h\u03042 and the coefficients A and B are determined by the\nboundary conditions for the wavefunction. The particle flux takes the form\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0001\nih\u0304\nh\u0304k\n\u2202\u03c8 \u2217\n\u2217 \u2202\u03c8\nJ =\u2212\n\u03c8\n=\n(14)\n|A|2 \u2212 |B|2 .\n\u2212\u03c8\n2m\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\nm\n\n\f5\n\nV0\nA'e -Kx B'e Kx\n\ne ikx\n\nT\n\nE\nR\n\nx\nFIG. 2: Tunneling of a wave across a potential barrier. The dash-dotted lines inside the barrier schematically show the decaying\nand amplifying evanescent waves inside.\n\nThat is, for propagating waves the flux is given by the difference in amplitudes between the forward and backward\ntravelling wave solutions.\nFor a wave of energy less than the barrier height, 0 < E < V0 , the wavefunction inside the barrier has the form,\n\u03c8(x) = A\u2032 e\u2212Kx + B \u2032 eKx ,\n\n(15)\nq\nwith K = 2m(V0 \u2212 E)/h\u03042 , and consists of two parts that decay and amplify with x, respectively. In this case, the\nparticle current is given by,\nJ =\u2212\n\nih\u0304K \u2032\u2217 \u2032\n(A B \u2212 B \u2032\u2217 A\u2032 ).\nm\n\n(16)\n\nCrucially, the particle current depends on the phase difference between A\u2032 and B \u2032 , that is, between the decaying and\ngrowing solutions. For a barrier of finite width with 0 < E < V0 , the coefficients A\u2032 and B \u2032 are complex and there is\na finite particle current.\nFor an incident evanescent wave, the energy is less than zero so the coefficients A\u2032 and B \u2032 are real as long as V0 is\nreal. Hence there is no particle flux in the entire system - reaffirming that an evanescent wave does not give rise\nto a particle current. However, in the case of an evanescent wave in an absorbing medium with \u03c8 = \u03c80 exp[\u2212Kx] K\ngiven by Eq. (13), the particle current is\nJ=\n\nh\u0304K \u2032\u2032\n|\u03c80 |2 exp(\u22122K \u2032 x).\nm\n\n(17)\n\nHere the change of phase due to the imaginary part of the potential causes a finite amount of absorption, and there\nis a finite particle current corresponding to absorption in the medium.\nIV.\n\nIMAGINARY POTENTIALS AND SCATTERING\n\nAs we have seen, an imaginary potential in Schr\u00f6dinger's equation can account phenomenologically for absorption\nin a flux of electrons. This approach has been applied to a number of problems in mesoscopics such as the effect\nof inelastic processes on tunneling resonances in one dimension.5 However, as Rubio and Kumar7 have pointed out,\nan imaginary potential causes scattering in addition to absorption and this means that it must be used with great\ncare. The scattering due to an imaginary potential introduced to model inelastic processes is frequently neglected (see\nRefs. 7, 5, and 11), but such an approximation is hardly warranted because there is no guarantee that the scattering\nshould be weak.\nA localized imaginary potential causes scattering, just like a real potential, because of the inevitable mismatch in\nthe overall potential where the imaginary potential begins and ends. We can see this effect more clearly by considering\nthe example used in Ref. 7 of a complex scatterer located at the origin, V (x) = (Vr \u2212 iVi )\u03b4(x). We use a delta-function\npotential because of its simplicity, even though it doesn't resemble the potential in any realistic mesoscopic system.\nHowever, the main features of this simple example carry over to much more realistic mesoscopic systems such as\ndouble barrier potentials.\n\n\f6\n\nFIG. 3: The absorption (A), reflection (|R|2 ), and transmission (|T |2 ) coefficients for a wave incident on a \u03b4 potential of\nstrength Vr \u2212 iVi . The real part Vr = 1 and m/(h\u03042 k) = 1 in the graph.\n\nBy solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for a plane wave, \u03c8(x) \u221d eikx , incident from the left (x = \u2212\u221e), we can obtain\nthe transmission (T ) and reflection (R) coefficients associated with the potential,7\n2\n\n|T |2 =\n\n1\n,\n1 \u2212 \u03be(Vr \u2212 iVi )\n\n|R|2 =\n\n\u03be(Vr \u2212 iVi )\n,\n1 \u2212 \u03be(Vr \u2212 iVi )\n\n(18)\n\n2\n\n(19)\n\nwhere \u03be = m/(ih\u03042 k). The absorption due to the potential, A = 1 \u2212 |T |2 \u2212 |R|2 , is given by\nA=\n\n2mVi /h\u03042 k\n.\n(1 + mVi /h\u03042 k)2 + (mVr /h\u03042 k)2\n\n(20)\n\nNotice that the absorption goes to zero when Vi = 0. In contrast, R 6= 0 when Vr is zero, but Vi is finite. Indeed, the\nbehavior of R, T , and A with increasing Vi is surprisingly complex, as shown in Fig. 3. Crucially, the absorption does\nnot increase steadily with Vi , but instead goes through a maximum and then decreases as Vi is increased further. Thus\nthe idea that the magnitude of the imaginary potential is a simple measure of absorption is incorrect. These surprising\nproperties are by no means peculiar to the \u03b4-function potential, but apply quite generally to complex potentials.7,12,13\nWe should point out, however, that it is possible to engineer some complex (real + imaginary) spatially varying\npotentials that completely absorb a wave without reflection or transmission at selected wave numbers.14 Carefully\nengineered potentials not withstanding, the basic lesson remains: it is not possible to model inelastic processes with\ncomplete fidelity in mesoscopic systems by simply adding an imaginary part to the potential. Such an ansatz always\ngives rise to additional scattering, which is an artifact of the model rather than physically real.\nFor light, an imaginary component in the dielectric constant generally gives rise to scattering as well as absorption.\nHowever, unlike the case of electrons, the scattering is not an artifact of an oversimplified model of absorption, but\nis physically real. For electromagnetic systems we are interested in learning how we should tailor the properties of\na material in order to observe certain types of behavior. In contrast, in the case of electrons we want to see how to\ntune the potential in order to faithfully model the physics of a particular system.\nIn electromagnetism there are exceptions to the link between absorption and scattering. In other words, we can\nconceive of a material in which there is absorption but no reflection. Consider, for example, the case of light passing\nfrom air to a medium with \u03b5 = \u03bc = 1 + i\u2206 at p\nnormal incidence. The reflection amplitude at the interface between\nthe media is R = (Z \u2212 1)/(Z + 1) where Z = \u03bc/\u03b5 is the impedance. Clearly there will be no reflection for \u03b5 = \u03bc\n\u221a\nas Z = 1. However, there will still be absorption because the refractive index, n = \u03b5\u03bc = 1 + i\u2206, is complex. The\nsame effect can be obtained by making the imaginary parts of both \u03b5 and \u03bc very large compared to the respective\n\n\f7\nreal parts. This effect turns out to be the basis of the \"stealth\" materials: a material that absorbs electromagnetic\nradiation without reflection sends no signal back to a radar and so, in principle, is undetectable. The breaking of\nthe link between absorption and reflection for electromagnetic waves is possible because there are more degrees of\nfreedom to play with compared to the case of electrons. In the Schr\u00f6dinger equation we are only able to make the\npotential complex, but in optical materials both the dielectric constant and the permeability constant can be made\ncomplex leading to a richer range of phenomena.\nIn passing, we note that optical media are amplifying when \u03b5i < 0. In contrast to electrons, coherent amplification\nof light is well-known and arises from stimulated emission - a characteristic unique to bosons. A mismatch in the\nimaginary part of the dielectric constant alone can cause resonant enhancement of the scattering coefficients when the\nscatterer is amplifying. For electrons, a positive imaginary component of the potential would formally correspond to\nthe amplification of the particle flux. Indeed, if the potential is a purely imaginary \u03b4-function, V = \u2212iVi \u03b4(x), then\nthe reflection and transmission coefficients diverge when Vi = \u2212h\u03042 k/m, as is clear from Eqs. (18) and (19). However,\nthere exists no analogous process for electrons that can give rise to coherent amplification of the particle flux.\nV.\n\nPERFECT ABSORBERS\n\nIn practice, maximizing the absorption is surprisingly complicated: increasing the imaginary part of the potential\n(for electrons) or the imaginary part of the dielectric constant (for light) does not simply equate to increased absorption;\nrather the effect of absorption can be drowned out by scattering. In optics, the way to produce absorption without\nreflection is to exploit the magnetic properties of the medium. However, for electrons there is no easy way of eliminating\nreflection entirely,14 so the question becomes one of optimizing the amount of absorption relative to the amount of\nreflection.\nThe problem of maximizing the absorption for the canonical case of electrons incident on a (real) double barrier\npotential with a constant imaginary potential in the well between the barriers was considered in Ref. 7. In this\ncase electrons that have energies close to those of the levels inside the well undergo resonant transmission. In the\nabsence of an imaginary potential the electrons spend a time \u223c h\u0304/\u0393e in the well,4 where \u0393e , the elastic resonance\nwidth, is determined by the size of the (real) potential barriers. The trick for maximizing absorption is to ensure\nthat the electrons are trapped in the potential well for as long as possible, while also making Vi (which gives rise to\nan inelastic resonance width \u0393i \u221d Vi ) as large as possible so that the absorber can gradually \"bleed\" the probability.\nHowever, making the imaginary part of the potential too large leads to additional scattering which starts to destroy\nthe resonance and thus reduce the time spent by the electron in the well. It turns out that the best compromise\nbetween dwell-time and absorption is achieved when the elastic and inelastic widths of the resonance are matched,\n\u0393e \u2243 \u0393i .\nFor non-magnetic optical media, maximizing the amount of absorption is also non-trivial. One particularly interesting case is that of surface plasmon modes at an air-metal interface where the analogy between optical and electronic\nsystems can be used to devise a way of maximizing the absorption of light by making use of a plasmon resonance.\nAt a resonant frequency, \u03c9, the real part of the metal's dielectric constant, \u03b5\u2032m (\u03c9) = \u2212\u03b5a , where \u03b5a is the dielectric\nconstant of air, and surface plasmon modes on the metal-air interface can be excited.15 These are purely longitudinal\nsolutions of Maxwell's equations and correspond to charge density oscillations on the metallic surface. A metal's\ndielectric permittivity disperses with frequency and the resonance condition can be achieved at some other frequency\nby swapping air for another medium with a suitable dielectric constant. The surface plasmon modes can be thought\nof as bound states at the metal surface because their amplitude decays exponentially on both sides of the air-metal\ninterface. However, for a dissipative metal the plasmons cannot exist as stationary states.\nUnder normal circumstances, the surface plasmon modes cannot be directly excited on a smooth surface by an\nincident propagating electromagnetic wave, because the wave vector of the surface plasmon is larger than the photon\nwave vector (|ksp | > \u03c9/c).16 However, it is possible to excite the surface modes on a structured metal surface (grating)\nor a rough metal surface by a propagating wave. For a metal film on a dielectric medium, we can again excite surface\nplasmons on the air-metal surface by impinging light at certain angles from inside the dielectric medium. It is also\npossible to resonantly excite the surface plasmon modes by an incident evanescent wave arising, for example, from\nthe near field modes of an object in air.\nLet us consider the case of an evanescent mode incident on a metal surface from air, with dielectric constants\n\u03b5m = \u03b5\u2032m + i\u03b5\u2032\u2032m and \u03b5a , respectively. For p-polarized light (the electric field vector lies in the plane of incidence), the\nmagnetic field on the air side of the interface is given by\ni\nh\n(a)\n(a)\n(21)\nH = [0 1 0]H0 ei(kx x\u2212\u03c9t) e\u2212kz z + Rekz z ,\n\n\f8\nwhere,\n(a)\n\nR=\n\n(m)\n\n(kz /\u03b5a \u2212 kz\n(a)\n(kz /\u03b5a\n\n+\n\n/\u03b5m )\n,\n(m)\nkz /\u03b5m )\n\n(22)\n\nis the Fresnel coefficient for reflection, which is obtained by matching the tangential components of the electric and\nmagnetic fields at the interface.8 Similarly, the magnetic field on the metal side of the interface is given by,\ni\nh\n(m)\n(23)\nH = [0 1 0]H0 ei(kx x\u2212\u03c9t) T e\u2212kz z ,\nwhere\nT = \u0010\n\n(m) (a)\nkz /\u03b5m \u03b5a\n\n2kz\n(m)\n\nkz\n\n(a)\n\n/\u03b5m + kz /\u03b5a\n\n\u0011\n\n(24)\n\n\u00012\n(m)\nis the Fresnel coefficient for transmission, and kx2 \u2212 (kz )2 = \u03b5m \u03c9c .\nIf we calculate the Poynting vector on the metal side, we obtain an expression very similar to that in Eq. (7)\nhSit = [\u03b5\u2032m kx , 0, \u03b5\u2032m kz\u2032\u2032 + \u03b5\u2032\u2032m kz\u2032 ]\n(m)\n\n\u2032\nc2\n|T |2 H02 e\u22122kz z ,\n8\u03c0\u03c9|\u03b5m |2\n\n(25)\n\n(m)\n\nwhere kz\u2032\u2032 = Im[kz ] and kz\u2032 = Re[kz ]. Although the energy flow is predominantly along the surface for large kx ,\nthere is a component normal to the boundary that corresponds to the energy dissipated in the metal.\nFor large kx , |T |2 \u223c 1/(\u03b5\u2032\u2032m )2 at the resonance (when \u03b5\u2032m = \u22121). Under these conditions the absorption is maximized\nin the limit that the imaginary part of the dielectric constant goes to zero. Increasing the value of \u03b5\u2032\u2032m causes a decrease\nin absorption because the consequent mismatch in dielectric constants at the boundary causes reflection and prevents\nthe wave from even entering the metal.\nThe conditions for maximizing absorption in this optical system turn out to be very similar to those for electrons\ntraversing a double potential well. In either case absorption arises from a small imaginary part to the dielectric constant\nor potential in combination with a resonance due to the corresponding real part. In both cases, the resonance keeps\nthe wave in the vicinity of the absorber long enough for it to suck energy (density) out of the wave.\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have discussed aspects of light and electron wave motion in dissipative media. Specifically, we have explored the\nproblems associated with propagating and evanescent light in absorbing media and by analogy the inelastic scattering\nof electrons in mesoscopic systems. Adding an imaginary part to the dielectric constant for light, or the potential for\nelectrons, can be used to model absorption, but it also causes additional scattering. This scattering complicates the\nuse of such phenomenological models to describe inelastic processes for electrons because the additional scattering\nis an unphysical artifact of the model. In fact, the spurious scattering due to the imaginary part can dominate\nand actually prevent absorption of the particle flux if it is large enough, which would clearly invalidate the model\ncompletely.\nFinally, we discussed the problem of maximizing the absorption of a wave. The existence of a bound state for\nelectrons greatly aids the absorption as it ensures that the electron remains in the region of absorption for a long\ntime while a small amount of absorption slowly bleeds the wave without scattering it out of the bound state. In this\ncase the analogy between electrons and light can be used to suggest a way of maximizing absorption of light in a\nnon-magnetic medium by exploiting a resonant surface plasmon state.\nAcknowledgments\n\nSAR would like to thank N.
