Each chain of the materials is composed of transition-metal\nions M +3 (=Pt+3 , Pd+3 , Ni+3 ) bridged by halogen ions X \u2212 (=Cl\u2212 , Br\u2212 , I\u2212 ), with ligands\nattached to the metals and in some cases counterions between the chains to maintain charge\nneutrality. M +3 has an unpaired electron in its dz 2 orbital (\u02c6z is parallel to the chain), and\nthis orbital makes an energy band through the supertransfer between neighbouring two dz 2\norbitals. This supertransfer comes from the hybridization between the dz 2 orbital and the\npz orbital of X. Because of the electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling, the charge transfer occurs\nbetween neighbouring two M \u2032 s so as to give the mixed-valence state. This is nothing but the\nCDW state with twice the period of the original lattice. The MX chain materials constitute\na rapidly expending class of near single-crystal quasi-one-dimensional systems with phases\nof ground states ranging from strong CDW to spin-density-wave or spin-Peierls [4].\nMany previous investigations of MX chain materials used the adiabatic approximation\nfor the phonons. The adiabatic approximation means neglect of the dynamic energy of halogen ions, that is, neglect of the effect of lattice vibration. In nonadiabatic case, the phonon\nfrequency \u03c9\u03c0 is finite. Generally speaking, the nonadiabatic effect will suppress the state\norder parameters of the system [5, 6]. As far as the optical-absorption coefficient is concerned, the results of adiabatic approximation methods have inverse-square-root singularity\nat the gap edge. By considering the nonadiabatic effect, the inverse-square-root singularity\nat the gap edge may disappear [7]. The relationship between the change of optic-absorption\nshape and the phonon frequency in the range from \u03c9\u03c0 = 0 to \u03c9\u03c0 \u2192 \u221e should be studied\nfor understanding the physical properties of e-ph interactions of MX chain in nonadiabatic\ncase.\n\n2\n\n\fThe one-dimensional one-band model for MX chain complexes can be written as [8, 9, 10]\nH=\n\nX\u0012\nl\n\nX\nX\n1 2 K 2\nPl + u l \u2212\nt0 (c\u2020l,s cl+1,s + c\u2020l+1,s cl,s ) +\n\u03b1(ul \u2212 ul+1 )c\u2020l,s cl,s + Hc ,\n2M\n2\nl,s\nl,s\n\u0013\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\nHc = U\n\nX\n\nnl,\u2191 nl,\u2193 + V\n\nX\n\nnl,s nl+1,s\u2032 .\n\n(2)\n\nl,s,s\u2032\n\nl\n\nHere c\u2020l,s and cl,s are the creation and annihilation operators of electrons sitting at site l\nwith spin s, ul (it's conjugated momentum is pl ) is the displacement of the lth ion, t0 is the\nsupertransfer energy of electrons between neighbouring two orbitals, \u03b1 is the e-ph coupling\nconstant, K is the elastic constant and M the mass of ions. U and V correspond to the\non-site and the nearest-neighbour Coulomb energies, respectively (throughout this paper, we\nset h\u0304 = kB = 1).\n\n2\n\nTheoretical analysis\n\nIn the Hamiltonian (1), the operators of lattice modes, ul and pl , can be expanded by the\nphonon creation and annihilation operators b\u2020\u2212q and bq , and after Fourier transformation, the\nH reads\nH = H 0 + Hep + Hc ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere\nH0 =\n\nX\nq\n\nHep =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c9\u03c0 b\u2020q bq +\n\nX\n1\n+\n\u01ebk c\u2020k,s ck,s ,\n2\nk,s\n\u0013\n\n1\n\u221a g(q)(bq + b\u2020\u2212q )c\u2020k+q,sck,s .\nN\nq,k,s\nX\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\nHere, \u01ebk = \u22122t0 cos k is the bare band function, and N is the total number of sites. The\nq\n\ncoupling function g(q) = \u03b1 1/(2M\u03c9\u03c0 )[1 \u2212 exp(iq)] and the dispersionless phonon frequency\n\u03c9\u03c0 =\n\nq\n\nK/M.\n\nIn order to take into account the fermion-phonon correlation, an unitary transformation\nis applied to H [11, 12],\nH \u2032 = exp(S)H exp(\u2212S),\n3\n\n(6)\n\n\fwhere the generator S is\n1 X g(q) \u2020\nS=\u221a\n(b\u2212q \u2212 bq )\u03b4(k + q, k)c\u2020k+q,sck,s .\nN q,k,s \u03c9\u03c0\n\n(7)\n\n\u2032\n\nHere we introduce a function \u03b4(k , k) which is a function of the energies of the incoming and\noutgoing fermions in the fermion-phonon scattering process and will be determined later.\nThe unitary transformation can proceed order by order,\n1\n1\nH \u2032 = H 0 + Hep + Hc + [S, H 0 ] + [S, Hep ] + [S, Hc ] + [S, [S, H 0 ]] + [S, [S, Hc ]] + O(\u03b13 ). (8)\n2\n2\nThe first-order terms in H \u2032 are\n1 X\nHep + [S, H 0 ] = \u221a\ng(q)(b\u2020\u2212q + bq )c\u2020k+q,sck,s\nN q,k,s\n1 X\ng(q)\u03b4(k + q, k)(b\u2020\u2212q + bq )c\u2020k+q,sck,s\n\u2212\u221a\nN q,k,s\n\n1 X g(q)\n+\u221a\n\u03b4(k + q, k)(b\u2020\u2212q \u2212 bq )(\u01ebk \u2212 \u01ebk+q )c\u2020k+q,s ck,s .\nN q,k,s \u03c9\u03c0\n\n(9)\n\nNote that the ground state |g0 i of H 0, the non-interacting system, is a direct product of a\nfilled fermi-sea |F Si and a phonon vacuum state |ph, 0 i [13]:\n|g0 i = |F S i |ph, 0 i .\n\n(10)\n\nApplying the first-order terms on |g0 i we get\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\n1 X\n\u01ebk \u2212 \u01ebk+q\n\u2020\n\u2020\n|g0 i , (11)\n(Hep + [S, H ])|g0 i = \u221a\ng(q)b\u2212q ck+q,sck,s 1 \u2212 \u03b4(k + q, k) 1 \u2212\n\u03c9\u03c0\nN q,k,s\n0\n\nsince bq |ph, 0 i = 0. As the band is half-filled, the Fermi energy \u01ebF = 0. Thus c\u2020k+q ck |F S i =\n6 0\nonly if \u01ebk+q \u2265 0 and \u01ebk \u2264 0.

For the gapped state\n(insulating state) we believe that the mean-field approximation is still an effective one.\nThe reason is as follows: The quadratic part of Heff (which can be exactly diagonalized)\ncontains a gap term (\u22060 (k) 6= 0) that is related to the Peierls dimerization and suppresses\nthe quantum fluctuations. Furthermore, the logarithmic singularity (related to the infrared\ndivergence of low dimensional system) has been removed by the factor 1 \u2212 \u03b4(k \u2212 \u03c0, k) =\n4t0 | cos k|/(\u03c9\u03c0 + 4t0 | cos k|). Comparing Eq. (24) with that in the adiabatic case, \u2206 = 2\u03b1u0,\nwe have the gap in the nonadiabatic case, \u2206 = \u2206(\u03c0/2) = 2\u03b1u0[c \u2212 1/2], which is nonzero\nbut smaller than the adiabatic gap.

The parameter values used are: \u03b12 /K = 0.5t0 ,\nU = 1.0t0 and V = 0.15t0 with \u03c9\u03c0 = 0.004t0, 0.008t0 , and 0.012t0 . One can see that the\nspectrum broadens but the peak height decreases as \u03c9\u03c0 increases. The inverse-square-root\nsingularity at the gap edge in the adiabatic case [16] disappears because of the nonadiabatic\neffect. For comparison, the adiabatic (\u03c9\u03c0 = 0) result is also shown which has an inversesquare-root singularity at gap edge. For finite \u03c9\u03c0 , the singularity is absent and there is a\nsignificant tail below the peak. We note that in our theory, in mathematical viewpoint, the\ndifference between the \u03c9\u03c0 = 0 and \u03c9\u03c0 > 0 cases mainly comes from the functional form of\nthe gap [see Eq. (24)]. Comparing it with that in the adiabatic limit, one can see that the\nsubgap states come from the quantum lattice fluctuations, i.e., the second term in the square\nbracket of Eq. (24).\nFigure 2 shows the calculated optical-absorption coefficients \u03b1(\u03c9) versus the normalized\nphoton frequency relations for \u03c9\u03c0 = 0.008t0 , U = 1.0t0 and V = 0.15t0 in the cases of\n\u03b12 /K = 0.3t0 , 0.4t0 , and 0.5t0 . One can see that as the e-ph coupling constant \u03b12 /K\nincreases, the peak of optical-absorption spectrum moves to higher photon energy and the\n9\n\n\fdimerization gap becomes wider.\nFigure 3 (a) and Figure 3 (b) show the calculated optical-absorption coefficients \u03b1(\u03c9)\nversus the normalized photon frequency relations for \u03c9\u03c0 = 0.008t0 and \u03b12 /K = 0.5t0 in the\ncases of different U and V values, respectively. One can see that the spectra are generally\nthe same, except that the peak height decreases and shifts to higher photon energy when\nU decreases or V increases. The on-site and the nearest-neighbour Coulomb repulsions\nare to weaken and strengthen the lattice dimerization, respectively. In the MX chain, a\ncharge-transfer (CT) excitation originates in the electron excitation over the CDW gap. If\nno definite fine structure can be observed in the absorption band, it cannot be clarified, only\nfrom the line shape of optical-absorption, whether this band is due to the CT exciton or the\ninterband transition. Wada et al. [17] claimed that because of the electric field dependence\nof the modulation signal observed in the measurement of the electroreflectance spectra of\nthe MX chain, it can be excluded that the CT excitation absorption band is an interband\nabsorption. However, K. Iwano et al. [18] indicated that in the case of weak electron-hole\nbinding, i.e., small V , the spectrum becomes the mixture of the exciton absorption and the\ninterband ones. If the value of V is reduced toward zero, the exciton contribution then\nbecomes more and more small and, finally, the exciton disappears and the spectrum is now\ngiven completely by the interband transitions. Our calculated result of the V = 0 case is also\nshown in Fig. 3 (b) and this is the optical-absorption spectrum of the interband transitions.\nIn Figure 4, we compare our calculation (solid line) with the observed optical absorption\n(solid circles) of MX chain complexes [19]. Here we use the same input parameters (without\nadjusting them) U = 1.0t0 and V = 0.3t0 , as those of K. Iwano and K. Nasu [18]. Other input\nparameters used are \u03c9\u03c0 = 0.01t0 and \u03b12 /K = 0.2t0 . One can see that the agreement between\nthe experiment result and our calculation is quite good. In experiments, the measurement\nof optical-absorption spectrum could be affected by various factors, such as the impurity in\nsamples, the finite measurement temperature, and the finite measurement resolution (about\n\u00b15% accuracy of the reflectivity measurement [19]). These made the measured absorption\nspectrum to be broadened and led to the slight discrepancy between the experiment result\nand our calculation.\n\n10\n\n\fIn Figure 5, we plot the calculated optical-absorption coefficients versus the rescaled\nphoton frequency relations with U = 1.0t0 and V = 0.15t0 for different \u03c9\u03c0 and \u03b12 /K. Quite\nremarkably, when we scale the optical-absorption coefficient by the peak value, and scale\nthe photon frequency by \u0393, the half-width for the low photon frequency side of the peak,\nwe find that the scaled curves for various \u03c9\u03c0 and \u03b12 /K values have an universal form below\nthe peak photon frequency. In their studies of temperature dependence of subgap optical\nconductivity for KCP(Br) and trans-polyacetylene, J.W. Wilkins et al. [20] discovered that\nthe strong subgap tail of the conductivity had an universal scaling form. We use the same\nscaling method as that of J.W. Wilkins et al., but to study the \u03c9\u03c0 and \u03b12 /K dependence of\noptical-absorption coefficient. Our universal form is similar to that of J.W. Wilkins et al.,\nwhich implies that the temperature effect and nonadiabatic effect on quasi-one-dimensional\nPeierls systems have similar characteristic properties.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nThe effects of quantum lattice fluctuations on the optical-absorption coefficient in the ground\nstate of MX chain are studied by introducing an energy-dependent e-ph scattering function\n\u03b4(k \u2032 , k) via an unitary transformation. The functional dependence of \u03b4(k \u2032 , k) on k \u2032 and k\nis determined by the vanishing of the second-order perturbation of first-order terms in the\ntransformed Hamiltonian. By using the retarded Green's-function method we have shown\nthat our theory gives a good description of the effects of quantum lattice fluctuations and\nchange of various parameters on the optical-absorption. The inverse-square-root singularity\nof optical-absorption spectrum at the gap edge in the adiabatic case disappears because\nof the nonadiabatic effect. The calculated optical-absorption coefficient is consistent well\nwith the experiment observation of optical conductivity measurements. The curve of subgap\noptical-absorption coefficient has an universal scaling form.\n\nReferences\n[1] H. Okamoto, and Y. Oka, Phys. Rev. B55, (1997) 6330.\n11\n\n\f[2] K. Iwano, K. Nasu, J. Phys.
