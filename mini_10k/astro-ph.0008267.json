They are typically\nmarked by a decrease (& 50%) in the flux density near 1 GHz for a period of several weeks to\nmonths, bracketed by substantial increases, viz.\nFigure 1. Because of the simultaneity of the events\nat different wavelengths, the time scales of the\nevents, and light travel time arguments, ESEs are\nlikely due to strong scattering by ionized structures, possibly in the Galactic interstellar medium\n(ISM; Fiedler et al. 1987a; Romani, Blandford, &\nCordes 1987; Walker & Wardle 1998). First identified in the light curves of extragalactic sources,\nESEs have since been observed during a timing\nprogram of the pulsars PSR B1937+21 (Cognard\net al. 1993; Lestrade, Rickett, & Cognard 1998)\nand PSR J1643\u22121224 (Maitia, Lestrade, & Cognard 1998).\nModelling of ESE light curves leads to inferred\ndensities ne & 102 cm\u22123 within these ionized\nstructures (Romani et al. 1987; Clegg, Fey, &\nLazio 1998). In turn, these densities imply pressures nT \u223c 106 K cm\u22123 or more, well in excess of the \"average\" interstellar pressure nT \u223c\n3000 K cm\u22123 (Kulkarni & Heiles 1988).\nA key issue regarding these ionized structures\nis their relationship to other phases of the interstellar medium. Do they represent (relatively)\nisolated structures, perhaps in pressure balance\nwith a lower density, higher temperature \"background\" phase (Clegg, Chernoff, & Cordes 1988)?\nor do they reflect a low level of cosmic-ray ionization within an otherwise neutral structure (Heiles\n1997)? or are they perhaps not interstellar at all,\nbut due to photoionized molecular clouds in the\nGalactic halo (Walker & Wardle 1998)?\nThis paper reports the first H I absorption measurements of a source (1741\u2212038, OT\u2212068) while\nit was undergoing an ESE. From these observations we can constrain the connection between the\nionized structures responsible for ESEs and any\nneutral structures. In \u00a72 we describe the observations, in \u00a73 we discuss the implications of our\nobservations, and in \u00a74 we present our conclusions\nand suggestions for future work.\n\nObservations and Analysis\n\nFigure 1 shows a portion of the 2.25 and\n8.3 GHz light curve of 1741\u2212038 as obtained\nby the US Navy's extragalactic source monitoring program at the Green Bank Interferometer (Fiedler et al. 1987b; Lazio et al. 2000a).\nClearly evident is an approximately 50% decrease in the source's flux density at 2.25 GHz\nand an approximately 25% decrease at 8.3 GHz.\nThe minimum occurred on or near 1992 May 25\n(JD 2448768.264), and the 2.25 GHz flux density\nof the ESE is nearly symmetric about this epoch.\nThe complete GBI light curve of 1741\u2212038, extending from 1983 to 1994, has been published\npreviously (Clegg et al. 1998).\nWe used the VLA to measure the H I absorption toward 1741\u2212038 at four epochs. Figure 2\nshows these four epochs; Table 1 summarizes the\nobserving logs for the four epochs. The first epoch,\n1991 September 6, was prior to the onset of the\nESE and shall be used as a control. The remaining three epochs occurred during the ESE.\nDuring the first epoch, full circular polarization\nwas recorded; only right circular polarization was\nrecorded for the three epochs during the ESE. At\nall four epochs on-line Doppler corrections and online Hanning smoothing were applied. A bandwidth of 0.78 MHz was recorded in 256 channels,\nproducing a velocity resolution of 0.64 km s\u22121 .\nThe observations on 1992 June 6 also included a\ncomparable amount of observing time with an observing bandwidth of 1.56 MHz in 256 channels,\nproducing a velocity resolution of 1.29 km s\u22121 . We\ncalibrated these data following the same procedures described below for the narrower bandwidth\nobservations. As these wider bandwidth observations were obtained at only a single epoch, we will\nfocus largely on the narrower bandwidth observations. We will use the wider bandwidth observations only to test for the possibility of H I absorption at large velocities.\nFor the three ESE epochs, observing runs consisted of scans on 3C 48 and 3C 286, for flux\ndensity calibration, and \"on-line\" and \"off-line\"\nscans of 1741\u2212038. On-line scans were centered\non an LSR velocity of 0 km s\u22121 and included\nthe H I line. Off-line scans were centered at an\nLSR velocity of \u2212360 km s\u22121 ; the scans on 3C 48\nand 3C 286 were frequency-shifted by an amount\n\n2\n\n\fTable 1\nVLA Observing Log\nEpoch\n1991\n1992\n1992\n1992\n1992\na\n\nSeptember 6\nJune 6a\nJune 6a\nJune 24\nJuly 28\n\nVLA\nConfiguration\n\nSynthesized\nBeam\n(\u2032\u2032 )\n\nPolarization\n\nBandwidth\n(MHz)\n\nVelocity\nResolution\n(km s\u22121 )\n\nOn-Source\nTime\n(hr)\n\nFlux\nDensity\n(Jy)\n\nA\nDnC\nDnC\nDnC\nD\n\n2.5\n50\n50\n50\n50\n\nR, L\nR\nR\nR\nR\n\n0.78\n0.78\n1.56\n0.78\n0.78\n\n0.64\n0.64\n1.29\n0.64\n0.64\n\n0.66\n2.2\n2.2\n3.3\n3.5\n\n2.13\n0.59\n0.59\n0.71\n1.92\n\nObservations on 1992 June 6 were obtained quasi-simultaneously with both 0.78 and 1.56 MHz bandwidths.\n\nbetween \u2212360 and \u2212442 km s\u22121 . For the 1991\nSeptember 6 epoch, there were no off-line scans\nof 1741\u2212038, the on-line scans of 1741\u2212038 were\ncentered at an LSR velocity of 30 km s\u22121 , only\n3C 286 was observed for flux density calibration\npurposes, and the scans of 3C 286 were frequency\nshifted to \u2212200 km s\u22121 and +200 km s\u22121 .\nFigure 3 shows the H I emission spectrum obtained by a single VLA antenna on 1992 June 24.\nThe emission spectra from the other three epochs\nare similar; in particular, the spectra at the other\ntwo ESE epochs show no deviations above the\n2\u03c3 level within the H I line. The shape of the\nline on 1991 September 6 is identical, though the\nmaximum amplitude of the line differs by approximately 10%. We would not expect any change\nduring the ESE because the large primary beam\nof the VLA antennas means that they are sensitive to H I emission on angular scales much larger\nthan any structures plausibly responsible for the\nESE itself. The emission spectra we obtain are\nin generally good agreement with that found by\nDickey et al. (1983) using the NRAO 90 m telescope: The peak emission occurs near 5 km s\u22121 ,\nand the emission is skewed toward positive velocities. The width of the emission line from our spectrum and the brightness temperature of the line\nare larger than that found by Dickey et al. (1983)\nowing to the smaller diameter antenna in our case\n(25 m vs. 90 m).\nBecause we are searching for changes in an absorption line with time, we discuss in detail the\nsteps we took to calibrate these observations. Our\nprimary focus will be on the three observations\nwith a common bandwidth and velocity resolution during the ESE. The calibration of the wider\n\nFig.\n1.- The extreme scattering event toward 1741\u2212038. The upper panel shows the\n8.3 GHz light curve, and the lower panel shows\nthe 2.25 GHz light curve. Both light curves were\nobtained with the Green Bank Interferometer.\n\nFig. 2.- The epochs of H I absorption during the\nESE of 1741\u2212038. The dots show the 2.2 GHz flux\ndensities measured by the Green Bank Interferometer. The vertical lines indicate the epochs at\nwhich H I absorption observations were acquired.\n3\n\n\fbandwidth observations on 1992 June 6 was identical to the procedure described below. The calibration of the first epoch, 1991 September 6, was\nextremely similar; we shall only point out the minor ways in which it differed from the calibration\nof the other four observations.\nThe conventional calibration of spectral-line observations involves determining a bandpass correction. With such widely distributed emission as for\nthe H I line, position-switched observations of another source cannot be utilized to find the bandpass correction, and frequency switching requires\nobservations both above and below the H I line.\nFurthermore, frequency switching can introduce\nphase jumps, which would then be propagated into\nthe bandpass correction, and errors introduced in\nthe frequency switching ultimately limit the bandpass that can be obtained (Wilcots, Brinks, & Higdon 1997). In this case, frequency-switched observations both above and below the H I line were\navailable only on 1991 September 6 and then only\nfor 3C 286.\nMore important than the shape of the bandpass\nduring any particular observation, however, is its\nstability from one observation to the next, particularly during the ESE. In order to assess this\nstability, we constructed bandpass corrections for\neach of the three ESE epochs using the off-line\nscans on 1741\u2212038. For any given antenna at any\nepoch, the amplitude of the bandpass correction\nwas within 8.4% of unity with a standard deviation of approximately 5% and the maximum phase\ncorrection was no more than 7.\u25e6 5 with a standard\ndeviation of approximately 5\u25e6 .\nWe decided ultimately to forego a bandpass\ncorrection. As further insurance against any\nbandpass-induced changes, we also excluded the\nfirst and last 16 channels from the analysis. We\nalso repeated the calibration described here for\nthe 1992 June 6 observations, including various\nbandpass calibrations determined from the offline scans of 1741\u2212038. We discuss the results\nin more quantitative detail below, but the lack\nof a bandpass calibration produces no significant\nchange in the absorption spectra we measure.\nAmplitude calibration was performed using\n3C 48 and 3C 286. The frequency offsets between the on-line scans and the frequencies at\nwhich 3C 48 and 3C 286 were observed contribute\nto less than a 0.1% bias in the flux density cali-\n\nbration. Far more important is the contribution\nof the H I line emission to the system temperature of the on-line scans. In order to avoid a bias,\nwe determined the antenna gain amplitudes for\n1741\u2212038 using the off-line scans only, then applied these to both the on- and off-line scans. For\nthe 1991 September 6 observations, for which no\noff-line scans of 1741\u2212038 were available, we used\nchannels well outside the range over which the H I\nemission was seen. Typical differences between\nthe flux densities on- and off-line were 10\u201315%.\nAs 1741\u2212038 is itself a VLA calibrator and well\napproximated by a point source over the range\nof available baselines, the visibility phases were\ncalibrated using the off-line scans on 1741\u2212038\nitself.\nThe observations during the three ESE epochs\nwere acquired when the VLA was in its most compact configurations (DnC and D). In these configurations the H I emission may not be entirely resolved out, particularly on the shortest baselines.\nAs a result there may be contamination of the H I\nspectra from the changing sky distribution of the\nH I emission moving through the VLA's sidelobes\nas the VLA tracks the source (Goss, van Gorkom,\n& Shaver 1979). After amplitude and phase calibration, we inspected the visibility amplitudes and\nphases on the shorter baselines for evidence of H I\nline contamination. We found that some shorter\nbaselines did show phase and/or amplitude offsets\ncharacteristic of such contamination. As a precaution we eliminated baselines shorter than 125 m\n(600\u03bb) from further analysis for all epochs.\nBefore imaging the data, a single iteration\nof phase-only self-calibration was performed on\na single continuum channel in the on-line data.\nThe starting model was a point source, with the\nflux density appropriate for each epoch (Table 1).\n1741\u2212038 is well approximated by a point source\nfor all VLA configurations, and we subtracted\nthe continuum in the visibility domain, utilizing\nline-free channels of the on-line data to generate\na linear baseline. We imaged and cleaned each\nchannel of the data cube separately. We also produced a continuum image from the line-free channels of the on-line data (prior to performing the\ncontinuum subtraction). Absorption spectra were\nformed by integrating the continuum-subtracted\ndata cube over a region whose size was that of the\nsynthesized beam and which was centered on the\n4\n\n\fposition of 1741\u2212038. These were converted to\nopacity spectra using the flux density determined\nby fitting a gaussian function to the continuum\nimage.\nFigure 4 shows the resulting H I opacity spectra for the four epochs. All of the spectra\nshow the presence of a strong absorption feature\nnear 5 km s\u22121 , a slight curvature resulting from\nthe absence of a bandpass correction, and a typical\nrms determined outside the H I line of \u03c3\u03c4 \u2248 0.012.\nOur absorption spectra are in good agreement\nwith that found by Dickey et al. (1983).\nAs a further assurance that our lack of a bandpass calibration has not introduced significant uncertainties, we repeated the above analysis using\ntwo different bandpass corrections applied to the\n1992 June 6 observations. We applied a bandpass correction determined from the off-line scans\nof 1741\u2212038 from 1992 June 6 and from 1992\nJune 24. In both cases, the spectral baseline after correction is more nearly constant with velocity. The rms uncertainty in the opacity spectrum\nincreases slightly with the application of the 1992\nJune 6 bandpass correction and little, if at all, with\nthe application of the 1992 June 24 bandpass correction. The increase in the rms uncertainty is approximately 25% from \u03c3\u03c4 \u2243 0.012 to \u03c3\u03c4 \u2243 0.015.\nIn order to account for the uncertainties resulting\nfrom the lack of a bandpass calibration and from\nany possible changes between epochs, we shall use\nthe value \u03c3\u03c4 = 0.015 as the value for the typical\nuncertainty in the opacity spectrum at all three\nepochs during the ESE.\n3.\n\nEmission Flux Density [Jy]\n\n100\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n-80\n\n-60\n\n-40\n\n-20\n\n0\n20\nLSR Velocity [km/s]\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\nFig. 3.- The H I emission spectrum as measured\nby a single VLA antenna on 1992 June 24.

All spectra were obtained by spatially integrating the brightness distribution of 1741\u2212038 at every frequency channel\nover a region comparable to the half-power width\nof the synthesized clean beam. Our angular resolution is such that 1741\u2212038 is unresolved, so we\ndo not show the images for these epochs. Shown\nin the upper left of each figure is the \u00b13\u03c3 uncertainty in the optical depth, determined from a\nregion of the spectrum where there is no absorption.

Table 2 summarizes these observable\nquantities at the four epochs.\nThere is no gross change in the absorption line,\n5\n\n\fTable 2\nObservable Quantities at Each Epoch\n\n1991\n1992\n1992\n1992\n\nEpoch\n\n\u03c4max\n\nv at \u03c4max\n(km s\u22121 )\n\nW\n(km s\u22121 )\n\nmax(\u2206\u03c4 )\n\nEpoch of max(\u2206\u03c4 )\n\nSeptember 6\nJune 6\nJune 24\nJuly 28\n\n0.79\n0.61\n0.61\n0.60\n\n5.5\n5.8\n5.8\n5.8\n\n6.27\n4.80\n4.77\n4.83\n\n***\n0.049\n0.049\n0.045\n\n***\n1992 June 24\n1992 June 6\n1992 June 6\n\nNote.-\u03c4max is the maximum optical depth. max(\u2206\u03c4 ) is the maximum difference in optical depths\nbetween two epochs. For a given epoch the maximum difference in optical depth occurs between itself and\nthe epoch listed in Column 6.\n\nparticularly during the ESE. The maximum optical depth for the ESE epochs is \u03c4 \u2243 0.61 and\noccurs at 5.8 km s\u22121 . The equivalent width is\nW \u2248 4.8 km s\u22121 , and from Table 2 the maximum difference in W between any two epochs is\n0.03 km s\u22121 . We estimate the uncertainty in W as\n\u03c3W = \u03c3\u03c4 \u2206v where \u2206v is the velocity extent of the\nline, \u2206v \u2248 10 km s\u22121 . Thus, \u03c3W \u2248 0.15 km s\u22121 ,\nand we conclude that there has been no change in\nthe equivalent width of the line.\nOne notable difference between the absorption\nspectra of 1991 September 6 and the ESE epochs\nis the change in the maximum optical depth. The\nmaximum optical depth for all four of our epochs\nalso differs from previous observations by Dickey\net al. (1983), \u03c4max \u2248 1, and Dickey & Benson (1982), \u03c4max \u2248 3. Dickey & Benson (1982)\nobserved 1741\u2212038 using an interferometer composed of the NRAO 140 ft and 300 ft telescopes\nin 1980 and 1981. Dickey et al. (1983) observed\n1741\u2212038 using the phased VLA in 1982. There\nis some danger in comparing observations from\ndifferent telescopes, and the large optical depth\nfound by Dickey & Benson (1982) has a large uncertainty associated with it. Nonetheless, these\nchanges in the optical depth are indicative of a\ndecreasing secular trend in the H I column density by 50% or more over the decade between the\nvarious observations.\nQualitatively, there do appear to be fine scale\nchanges in the line shape from epoch to epoch dur-\n\ning the ESE. In particular the line has two, nearly\nequally deep minima on 1992 June 6, but only a\nsingle deep minimum in the other two epochs. We\nassess the significance of this difference in the line\nshape quantitatively by finding the maximum difference in optical depth between two epochs at the\nsame velocity (Columns 4 and 5 of Table 2).\nThe maximum optical depth difference between\nany two epochs occurs between 1992 June 6 and\nJune 24 and is max(\u2206\u03c4 ) = 0.049. The maximum difference between 1992 June 6 and July 28 is\n0.045. (The difference between 1992 June 24 and\nJuly 28 is half this value, reflecting their qualitatively more similar shapes.) We do not regard\nany of these differences as significant. The rms\nuncertainty in an individual opacity spectrum is\n\u03c3\u03c4 = 0.015. Adding the uncertainties from two\nspectra in quadrature, the combined uncertainty\nis 0.021, meaning that the maximum deviation is\nless than 2.3\u03c3. We have also examined the difference spectra (i.e., the spectra formed by taking the\ndifference in the absorption spectra at two epochs)\nfor any skewness. If line features either appear\nor disappear, one would expect an excess of either positive or negative deviations about the average. Conversely, if the deviations are simply the\nresult of measurement uncertainty, there should\nbe a roughly equal number of positive and negative deviations about the average. The latter is\nthe case for all three difference spectra.\nIn addition to the line shape not changing by\n\n6\n\n\fposed tiny-scale atomic structures (TSASs) as being responsible for the ESE. TSASs are AU-scale\nstructures distributed throughout the Galactic interstellar medium with neutral column densities\nNH \u223c 3 \u00d7 1018 cm\u22122 and interior temperatures\nTs \u223c 15 K. Heiles (1997) proposes TSASs in order to explain observations of small (angular) scale\nchanges in the H I opacity, though he does not associate TSASs explicitly with ESEs.\nObviously, geometrical factors (e.g., a line of\nsight that does not cut through the center of a\nTSAS) could account for the discrepancy. Other\nindications of an association between TSASs and\nionized structures are also not clear-cut. In favor\nof an association is that Clegg et al. (1998) reproduced the ESE light curve of 1741\u2212038 by assuming a gaussian refracting lens passed in front of\nthe source; they find an electron column density\nof 10\u22124 cm\u22123 pc is required to produce the light\ncurve, comparable to what the TSASs should have\nin their interiors due to photoionization (Heiles\n1997). On the other hand a comparable change in\nthe dispersion measure of PSR B0823+26 occurred\n(Phillips & Wolszczan 1991) with no change in the\nH I opacity (Frail et al. 1994). Though, after the\nconclusion of the DM monitoring program, an H I\nopacity change was detected.\nOur limit on \u2206NH appears to rule out Galactic\nhalo molecular clouds, the AU-scale, H I-opaque\nstructures that Walker & Wardle (1998) have proposed to explain ESEs. The photoionized skins of\nthese clouds would provide the necessary refracting media for ESEs. We see no indication of a\n\u03c4 > 1 feature in our spectra (though Walker 2000,\nprivate communication, has since suggested that\n\u03c4 \u223c 0.1 might be more accurate). Walker &\nWardle (1998) point out that, because of multiple imaging, an H I absorption line during an ESE\ncould saturate with a non-zero intensity, but Lazio\net al. (2000b) find no evidence of multiple imaging in VLBI images of 1741\u2212038 acquired at similar epochs as these H I absorption measurements.\nHowever, as halo objects, the clouds could have\nvelocities approaching 500 km s\u22121 (i.e., a velocity range of 1000 km s\u22121 ). The velocity range of\nour observations, even the wide bandwidth observations of 1992 June 6, is considerably less, being\nno more than 250 km s\u22121 . Thus, a significant H I\nabsorption line could have been present outside of\nour velocity range.\n\nany significant amount, there is also no evidence\nfor the appearance of additional absorption components at other velocities. The only significant\nabsorption occurs between \u22125 and 10 km s\u22121\nfor all four epochs. We can also compare the\nabsorption spectrum from our wider bandwidth\n(1.56 MHz; 1992 June 6) to those of Dickey et\nal. (1983) as they have a similar velocity coverage. Both spectra have a single deep absorption\nfeature, with no significant absorption outside of\nit.\n3.2.\n\nESE Structures\n\nOur limit on changes in the optical depth during the ESE of \u2206\u03c4 < 0.05 implies the neutral\ncolumn density change during the ESE must be\nlimited to\n\u0013\n\u0012\nTs\n(1)\n\u2206NH < 6.4 \u00d7 1018 cm\u22122\n100 K\nfor the structure(s) responsible for the ESE. Here\nTs is the spin temperature of the H I within the\nstructure, and we have assumed that the structure\nresponsible for this ESE is optically thin to H I\nradiation. This assumption is justified by the lack\nof a large change in the H I profile.\nWe consider Ts \u2248 200 K and Ts \u223c 10 K as possible values for Ts . The former value is motivated\nfrom observations by Dickey & Benson (1982) who\nfind a typical value of Ts \u223c 200 K for 14 lines of\nsight with a Galactic latitude 10\u25e6 < |b| < 20\u25e6\n(1741\u2212038 has b = 13\u25e6 and is one of the 14 lines\nof sight observed). The latter value is motivated\nfrom models by Heiles (1997) and Walker & Wardle (1998), who have both proposed a population\nof cold, small-scale structures.\nIf Ts \u2248 200 K, then \u2206NH < 1.3 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 .\nThis is not a stringent limit. Models of ESE lenses\nrequire electron column densities Ne \u223c 1016 cm\u22122\n(Fielder et al. 1994; Clegg et al. 1998). We presume that any H I structure associated with an\nESE lens will have a size scale of order the ESE\nlens, namely AU scale. If the neutral structure\nis in approximate pressure balance with the ESE\nlens (which itself may be overpressure with respect to the ambient medium, \u00a71), then the neutral structure would have column densities NH \u223c\n1018 cm\u22122 , well below this observational limit.\nIf Ts \u223c 10 K, then \u2206NH < 6.4 \u00d7 1017 cm\u22122 .\nThis limit marginally rules out Heiles' (1997) pro7\n\n\fAll models considered thus far have explained\nan ESE as being due to an ionized object, either\npartially or totally ionized, occulting a background\nsource. An alternate possibility is suggested by the\ndecrease in the H I optical depth observed between\nthe 1991 September 6 observations and the epochs\nduring the ESE. If an ionizing source crossed the\nline of sight to 1741\u2212038 and ionized some of the\nhydrogen, the result would be a decrease in the optical depth of the line. The difference in equivalent\nwidths between 1991 September 6 and the epochs\nduring the ESE is 1.47 km s\u22121 . The resulting total change in the column density, integrated over\nthe line is NH = 2.7 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 (Ts /10 K).\nWe assume that any such ionized region would\nbe comparable in extent to the angular diameter of\n1741\u2212038, about 0.5 mas (Fey, unpublished data).\nAt a distance of 100 pc, the total quantity of hydrogen that would have been ionized was 1.2 \u00d7\n1043 (Ts /10 K)(D/100 pc)2 atoms. An estimate of\nthe ionizing rate required to maintain the ionization for this many atoms is, following Osterbrock\n(1989), at least 1038 s\u22121 (Ts /10 K)2(D/100 pc), assuming that the ionized region was approximately\nspherical. An A0 star would suffice as an ionizing\nsource.\n4.\n\noptical depth change between any two epochs during the ESE is \u2206\u03c4 < 0.05 (2.3\u03c3) which we do not\nregard as significant.\nThe limit on the optical depth change, \u2206\u03c4 <\n0.05, implies a limit on the H I column density of\nany neutral structure(s) associated with the ESE\nlens, NH < 6.4 \u00d7 1018 cm\u22122 (Ts /100 K), having a\nspin temperature Ts = 100 K. This limit poses\nno significant constraint on structures with Ts \u2248\n200 K.\nSome proposed colder structures are allowed.\nTiny-scale atomic structures (Heiles 1997), with\nTs \u2248 15 K and NH \u223c 3 \u00d7 1018 cm\u22122 , are\nmarginally ruled out, though geometric arguments\nmay allow TSASs to be responsible for ESEs and\nmeet this constraint on the H I column density.\nWalker & Wardle (1998) propose cold, H I-opaque\nmolecular clouds in the Galactic halo. Any such\nstructures within our observed velocity range are\nclearly excluded. However, the observed velocity\nrange covers only 25% of the allowed range, so such\na cloud could have been responsible for this ESE\nwithout violating our observational constraints.\nWe are grateful to E.

The absorption\nfeature itself is probably a blend of multiple components. Our absorption spectra are quite similar\nto a lower-resolution spectrum obtained by Dickey\net al. (1983).\nWe find a secular trend of decreasing maximum optical depth during the decade between the\nobservations of Dickey & Benson (1982), Dickey\net al. (1983), and those reported here.
