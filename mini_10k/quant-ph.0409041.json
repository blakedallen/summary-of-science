Our model assumes\nthe coupling to be a delta function. It is used to calculate the effect of curve crossing on electronic\nabsorption spectrum and resonance Raman excitation profile.\n\narXiv:quant-ph/0409041v1 7 Sep 2004\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nNonadiabatic transition due to potential curve (or surface) crossing is one of the most important mechanisms\nto effectively induce electronic transitions in collisions [1].\nThis is a very interdisciplinary concept and appears in\nvarious fields of physics and chemistry, even in biology\n[2]. The most typical examples are, of course, a variety of atomic and molecular processes such as atomic\nand molecular collisions, chemical reactions and molecular spectroscopic processes. Attempts have been made to\nclassify organic reactions by curve crossing diagrams [3].\nOther examples are nuclear collisions and reactions in nuclear physics [4, 5], dynamic processes on solid surfaces,\nenergy relaxation and phase transitions in condensed\nphase physics [6, 7], and electron and proton transfer\nprocesses in biology [8, 9]. Two state curve crossing can\nbe classified into the following two cases according to the\ncrossing scheme: (1) Landau-Zener (L.Z) case, in which\nthe two diabatic potential curves have the same signs for\nthe slopes and (2) non-adiabatic tunnelling (N.T) case,\nin which the diabatic curves have the opposite sign for\nslopes. There is also a non-crossing non-adiabatic transition called the Rosen-Zener-Demkov type [1, 2], in which\ntwo adiabatic potentials are in near resonance at large\nR. The theory of non-adiabatic transitions dates back to\n1932, when the pioneering works for curve-crossing and\nnon-crossing were published by Landau [10], Zener [11]\nand Stueckelberg [12] and by Rosen and Zener [13] respectively. Since then numerous papers by many authors\nhave been devoted to these subjects, especially to curve\ncrossing problems. Two categories might be classified for\nfinding an exact analytical solution of the curve crossing\nproblem. The first is that an exact analytical solution\ncan be obtained for the whole region of the variable (say\nx here, see in the next section). For example, Osherov\nand Voronin solved the case where two diabatic potentials are constant with exponential coupling [14]. C. Zhu\nsolved the case where two diabatic potentials are exponential with exponential coupling [15]. The second is that\nan exact analytical solution is not possible for the whole\nregion of the variable, but is possible for the asymptotic\nregion. Then, physical quantities such as eigenvalues,\nscattering matrices can still be solved in an exact analytical form, providing that the connection problem of the\nasymptotic solution is known. The Stokes phenomenon\n\n[16] of asymptotic solution of the ordinary differential\nequation provides a powerful tool to deal with these kinds\nof problems [17, 18, 19]. Generalizing the real variable to\nthe complex variable and tracing the asymptotic solution\naround the complex plane, the connection matrix which\nconnects the asymptotic solution in the complex plane\ncan be expressed in terms of Stokes constants. Recent\nwork by Zhu and Nakamura [19] found an exact analytical solution of the Stokes constants for the second-order\nordinary differential equation with the coefficient function as the fourth-order polynomial. In this way, exact\nanalytical solutions of scattering matrices were obtained\nfor the two state linear curve crossing problem with constant coupling [20].\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nWe consider two diabatic curves, crossing each other.\nThere is a coupling between the two curves, which causes\ntransitions from one curve to another. This transition\nwould occur in the vicinity of the crossing point. In particular, it will occur in a narrow range of x, given by\n|V1 (x) \u2212 V2 (x)| \u2243 |V (xc )| .\n\n(1)\n\nwhere x denotes the nuclear coordinate and xc is the\ncrossing point. V1 and V2 are the diabatic curves and\nV represent the coupling between them. Therefore it is\ninteresting to analyze a model, where coupling is localized\nin space near xc . Thus we put\nV (x) = K0 \u03b4(x \u2212 xc ),\n\n(2)\n\nhere K0 is a constant. This model has the advantage\nthat it can be exactly solved (delta function sink model\nfor electronic relaxation in solution is known in literature [21]). One can roughly estimate the value of K0\nas follows. If the two curves are approximated as linear near the vicinity of crossing,\n\u0002 \u2202 then the \u0003energy sep(V1 \u2212 V2 ) xc (x \u2212 xc ).\naration between the two is \u2248 \u2202x\nThis will be of the order of \u2206V (xc ), if (x \u2212 xc ) takes\n\u2206V (xc )\n. So it is reasonable to put\nthe value \u2243 \u2202 (V\n( \u2202x 1 \u2212V2 ))xc\nK0 =\n\n2V (xc )\n\u2202\n(V1 \u2212V2 ))\n( \u2202x\nxc\n\n\u00d7 V (xc ).\n\n\f2\nThis may be written as\n\nEXACT ANALYTICAL SOLUTION\n\nWe start with a particle moving on any of the two diabatic curves. The problem is to calculate the probability\nthat the particle will still be on any one of the diabatic\ncurves after a time t.

In the position\nrepresentation, the above equation may be written as\nZ \u221e\n\u03a8(x, \u03c9) = i\nG(x, x0 ; \u03c9)\u03a8(x0 , \u03c9)dx0 ,\n(10)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere G(x, x0 ; \u03c9) is\nG(x, x0 ; \u03c9) = hx|(\u03c9 \u2212 H)\u22121 |x0 i.\n\n(11)\n\nWriting\nG(x, x0 ; \u03c9) =\n\n\u0012\n\nG11 (x, x0 ; \u03c9) G12 (x, x0 ; \u03c9)\nG21 (x, x0 ; \u03c9) G22 (x, x0 ; \u03c9)\n\n\u0013\n\n(12)\n\nand using the partitioning technique [22] we can write\nH=\n\n\u0012\n\nH1 (x) V (x)\nV (x) H2 (x)\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Hi (x) is\nHi (x) = \u2212\n\n1 \u22022\n+ Vi (x).\n2m \u2202x2\n\n(6)\n\nWe find it convenient to define the half Fourier Transform\n\u03a8(\u03c9) of \u03a8(t) by\nZ \u221e\n\u03a8(\u03c9) =\n\u03a8(t)ei\u03c9t dt.\n(7)\n\nG11 (x, x0 ; \u03c9) = hx|[\u03c9 \u2212H1 \u2212V (\u03c9 \u2212H2 )\u22121 V ]\u22121 |x0 i. (13)\nThe above equation is true for any general V . This\nexpression simplify considerably if V is a delta function\nlocated at xc . In that case V may be written as V =\nK0 S = K0 |xc i hxc |. Then\nG11 (x, x0 ; \u03c9) = hx|[\u03c9 \u2212 H1 \u2212 K02 G02 (xc , xc ; \u03c9)S]\u22121 |x0 i,\n(14)\nwhere\nG02 (x, x0 ; \u03c9) = hx|(\u03c9 \u2212 H2 )\u22121 |x0 i,\n\n(15)\n\n0\n\nHalf Fourier transformation of Eq.

(8)\n\nand corresponds to propagation of the particle starting\nat x0 on the second diabatic curve, in the absence of\ncoupling to the first diabatic curve. Now we use the\noperator identity\n\n(\u03c9 \u2212 H1 \u2212 K02 G02 (xc , xc ; \u03c9)S)\u22121 = (\u03c9 \u2212 H1 )\u22121 + (\u03c9 \u2212 H1 )\u22121 K02 G02 (xc , xc ; \u03c9)S[\u03c9 \u2212 H1 \u2212 K02 G02 (xc , xc ; \u03c9)S]\u22121 . (16)\n\nR\u221e\nInserting the resolution of identity I = \u2212\u221e dy |yi hy| in\nthe second term of the above equation, we arrive at\nG11 (x, x0 ; \u03c9) =G01 (x, x0 ; \u03c9) + K02 G01 (x, xc ; \u03c9)\n\n(17)\n\nG02 (xc , xc ; \u03c9)G11 (xc , x0 ; \u03c9).\n\n(18)\n\n\u00d7\n\ngives\n\nG11 (xc , x0 ; \u03c9) =G01 (xc , x0 ; \u03c9)\n\u00d7 [1 \u2212\n\n(19)\n\nK02 G01 (xc , xc ; \u03c9)G02 (xc , xc ; \u03c9)]\u22121 .\n(20)\n\nPutting x = xc in Eq. (17) and solving for G11 (xc , x0 ; \u03c9)\n\nThis when substituted back into Eq. (17) gives\n\n\f3\n\nG11 (x, x0 ; \u03c9) = G01 (x, x0 ; \u03c9) +\n\nK02 G01 (x, xc ; \u03c9)G02 (xc , xc ; \u03c9)G01 (xc , x0 ; \u03c9)\n.\n1 \u2212 K02 G01 (xc , xc ; \u03c9)G02 (xc , xc ; \u03c9)\n\nUsing the same procedure one can get\nG12 (x, x0 ; \u03c9) =\n\nK0 G01 (x,xc ;\u03c9)G02 (xc ,x0 ;\u03c9)\n.\n1\u2212K02 G01 (xc ,xc ;\u03c9)G02 (xc ,xc ;\u03c9)\n\n(22)\n\n(21)\n\ngating wave functions on the excited state potential energy curves are given by solution of the time dependent\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation\n\nSimilarly one can derive expressions for G22 (x, x0 ; \u03c9) and\nG21 (x, x0 ; \u03c9). Using these expressions for the Green's\nfunction in Eq. (9) we can calculate \u03a8(\u03c9) explicitly.\nThe expressions that we have obtained for \u03a8(\u03c9) are quite\ngeneral and are valid for any V1 (x) and V2 (x). However, their utility is limited by the fact that one must\nknow G01 (x, x0 ; \u03c9) and G02 (x, x0 ; \u03c9). It is possible to find\nG0i (x, x0 ; \u03c9) only in a few limited cases and the harmonic\noscillator is one of them.\nELECTRONIC ABSORPTION SPECTRA AND\nRESONANCE RAMAN EXCITATION PROFILE\n\nIn this section we apply the method to the problem\ninvolving harmonic potentials. We consider a system of\nthree potential energy curves, ground electronic state and\ntwo 'crossing' excited electronic states (electronic transition to one of them is assumed to be dipole forbidden and\nwhile it is allowed to the other) [23, 24].

As G0i (x, x0 ; \u03c9) for the harmonic potential is known [26], we can calculate G(x, x0 ; \u03c9). We\nuse Eq. (31) to calculate the effect of curve crossing on\nresonance Raman excitation profile.\n\nResults using the model\n\nIn the following we give results for the effect of curve\ncrossing on electronic absorption spectrum and resonance Raman excitation profile in the case where one\ndipole allowed electronic state crosses with a dipole forbidden electronic state as in Fig. 1. As in [24], the\nground state curve is taken to be a harmonic potential energy curve with its minimum at zero. The curve\nis constructed to be representative of the potential energy along a metal-ligand stretching coordinate. We take\nthe mass as 35.4 amu and the vibrational wavenumber\nas 400 cm\u22121 [24] for the ground state. The first diabatic excited state potential energy curve is displaced by\n0.197 \u00c5 and is taken to have a vibrational wavenumber\nof 400 cm\u22121 . Transition to this state is allowed. The\nminimum of the potential energy curve is taken to be\nabove 10700 cm\u22121 of that of the ground state curve. The\nsecond diabatic excited state potential energy curve is\ntaken to be an un-displaced excited state. On that potential energy curve, the vibration is taken to have same\nwavenumber of 400 cm\u22121 . Its minimum is 11000 cm\u22121\nabove that of the ground state curve. Transition to this\nstate is assumed to be dipole forbidden. The two diabatic curves cross at an energy of 11673.6 cm\u22121 with\nxc = 0.0895 \u00c5. Value of K0 we use in our calculation\nis K0 = 5.9643 \u00d7 10\u221215 erg.\u00c5. The lifetime of both the\nexcited states are taken to be 100 cm\u22121 . The calculated\nelectronic absorption spectra is shown in Fig. 2. The\nprofile shown by the dashed line is in the absence of any\ncoupling to the second potential energy curve. The full\n\n\f5\nline has the effect of coupling in it. The calculated resonance Raman excitation profile is shown in Fig. 3. The\nprofile shown by the full line is calculated for the coupled potential energy curves. The profile shown by the\ndashed line is calculated for the uncoupled potential energy curves. It is seen that curve crossing effect can alter\nthe absorption and Raman excitation profile significantly.\nHowever it is the Raman excitation profile that is more\neffected. Even though our calculations are for a simple\nmodel (which has the convenience that everything can\nbe found analytically), similar conclusions are valid for\nmore complicated couplings [24].\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have proposed a simple model for the two state curve\ncrossing problem which can be analytically solved. Our\nsolution is quite general and is valid for any potentials\nfor which Green's functions for the motion in the absence\nof coupling is known. The model is used to calculate the\neffect of curve crossing on electronic absorption spectrum\nand on resonance Raman excitation profile. We find that\nRaman excitation profile is affected much more by the\ncrossing, than the electronic absorption spectrum.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe author thanks Prof. K. L.
