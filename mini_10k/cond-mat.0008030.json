Introduction\nThe recently discovered [1], superconducting compounds RNi2 B2 C, where\nR is rare earths (Lu, Tm, Er, Ho and Dy) and Y, still remain a hot topic of\nintensive research. Their crystallographic structure resembles that of highTc materials, albeit being 3D in electronic properties. The mechanism of\nCooper pairing in these compounds is not known in detail although they\nare commonly believed to be mediated by the ordinary electron-phonon\ninteraction, like A15. The boron isotope effect [2, 3] clearly points that the\nphonons are involved in superconductivity . Whether these compounds are\ns\u2212 or d\u2212wave superconductors [4] is still under debate. The important subclass in these materials is presented by the magnetic compounds (R =Tm,\nEr, Ho, and Dy), with the antiferromagnetic (AFM) order [5] and weak\nferromagnetism (Er) [6] coexisting with superconductivity.\nThe measurements of the quasiparticle density of states (DOS) by tunneling spectroscopy encounters experimental difficulties, especially these refer to the magnetic superconductors. To our knowledge, no information is\navailable about the electron-quasiparticle-interaction (EQI) spectral function measured by tunneling spectroscopy in the superconducting state,\nwhich unambiguously allows one to determine the mechanism of Cooper\npairing.\nAn investigation of point contacts between a normal metal and a superconductor can partially solve these problems. The superconducting energy gap and DOS can be measured by Andreev-reflection spectroscopy\n[7], and EQI spectral function can be obtained by inelastic point-contact\n\n\f2\nspectroscopy (PCS) both in the normal [9] and in the superconducting [10]\nstates. Comparing the tunneling junction with point contacts, we can see\nthat the boundary between RNi2 B2 C-superconductor and vacuum (dielectric) in tunnel devices constitutes much stronger discontinuity than the\ninterface between RNi2 B2 C and a normal metal in point contacts, since in\nthe latter case there is a Fermi-sea of electrons at both sides around the\ninterface with no additional dielectric layer introduced. This discontinuity\nmay severely influence the measurements making them different from the\nbulk properties.\nThe schematic experimental setup is shown in Fig.1. A small noble\nmetal (Ag, Cu) rod with sharp edges touches the (a \u2212 b)-plane edge of a\nflat RNi2 B2 C single crystal or a sharp edge of a polycrystal with an a priory\nunknown orientation. Many spots can be tried both on the rod and along\nthe RNi2 B2 C edge for investigating the point contacts. The temperature\nand magnetic field can be varied, the latter, in case of a single crystal, is\noriented either k or \u22a5 to the a\u2212 b plane. The I \u2212 V characteristics and their\nfirst, R(V ) = dV /dI(V ), and second, dR/dV (V ), derivatives are recorded\nby\n\u221a means of a standard lock-in technique. The latter equals dR/dV (V ) =\n2 2V2 /V12 , where V2 is the second harmonic and V1 is the modulation rms\nvoltage. The diameter of a point contact can\u221abe estimated through the\nSharvin formula for a clean orifice d = 27.5/ R0 where d is in nm, the\nnominator is the average of the noble metal and RNi2 B2 C [11], and R0 is\nthe zero-bias normal-state resistance of a contact in \u03a9.\n2. Superconducting energy gap measurements by Andreev-reflection\nspectroscopy.\n2.0.1. BCS-like DOS in paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic state of\nRNi2 B2 C (R=Dy, Tm)\nRecently the temperature dependence of quasiparticle DOS has been measured in the DyNi2 B2 C-Ag point contacts [11] by means of Andreev-reflection\nspectroscopy. The R(V )-curves normalized by the normal-state R(V ) dependences are fitted very well with the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (BTK)\ntheory [7] with a zero smearing parameter \u0393 [8]. This evidences that the\nquasiparticle DOS is BCS-like in this material. The superconducting energy gap extrapolated to zero temperature equals (3.63\u00b10.05) kB Tc which\nevidences that on the average DyNi2 B2 C is a moderately strong coupling\nsuperconductor. The only disagreement with the BTK theory is that the\ndecrease of the differential resistance around zero bias in the superconducting state is typically a few percentage, instead of the order of one-half\nof a normal resistance [7]. This can be due either to microscopic inhomogeneity of the material under the contact where only a small part re-\n\n\f3\nveals the unperturbed superconducting properties, or to the intrinsically\ndecreased Andreev reflection from an AFM superconductor with ferromagnetically ordered DyC planes. It should be stressed that DyNi2 B2 C is the\nonly RNi2 B2 C compound which has Tc < TN . Hence, one might think that\nthe molecular field due to the AFM order averages to zero on the scale of\nsuperconducting coherence length except of very narrow directions almost\nparallel to the a \u2212 b planes.\nThe situation is different in TmNi2 B2 C where incommensurate spin\nwave ordering occurs at temperatures much below the superconducting\ntransition (Tc \u226b Tm ) and the superconductivity develops in the paramagnetic state. Preliminary results [12] show that the overall behavior of R(V )curves also fits the BTK predictions. That means that this compound also\nhas the BCS form of quasiparticle DOS.\n2.0.2. Fine structure in temperature dependence of superconducting\nenergy gap in ErNi2 B2 C near Tm .\nThe overall temperature dependence of the Andreev-reflection spectra in\nErNi2 B2 C (Fig.2) also follows the BTK model. In this material Tc > Tm\nand around Tm = 6.5 K spin fluctuations depress the superconducting order\nparameter which manifested as the lowering of Hc2 near Tm [13]. Recently,\nthis depression has been measured using the temperature dependence of the\nsuperconducting penetration depth \u03bb(T ) [14] which together with superconducting coherence length \u03be(T ) permits determination of the\n\u221a temperature\ndependence of the thermodynamic critical field Hc = \u03c60 /[2 2\u03c0\u03be(T )\u03bb(T )]\nproportional to the superconducting order parameter (energy gap). Direct\nmeasurement of the superconducting energy gap by means of the Andreev\nreflection and corresponding BTK fitting (Fig.2) is shown in Fig.3. There\nis a noticeable dip in \u2206(T ) around Tm , but the overall dependence follows the BCS law shown with the solid line. For this particular contact\nmeasured on polycrystalline sample with unknown orientation, the extrapolated gap is 1.82 mV (2\u22060 =4.23 kB Tc ), which is larger than the average\nvalue \u22060 /kB Tc = 3.66 \u00b1 0.4 [15], probably because of underestimated Tc .\nInterestingly, the \u0393-parameter drops around Tm while it takes relatively\nlarge value at other temperatures. The barrier parameter Z experiences no\nchange around Tm . We emphasize that except the small anomaly around\nTm , the quasiparticle density of states in superconducting state can be approximated by the BCS dependence both in paramagnetic and AFM states\nas follows from the BTK fits (Fig.2).\n2.0.3. Two superconducting states of HoB2 Ni2 C.\nIn the Ho-compound, the superconducting transition temperature (Tc = 8.7\nK) is close to that of the magnetic transition temperature (Tm \u223c 8.5 K) into\n\n\f4\nthe incommensurate helical state with wave vector q\u2217c =0.91c\u2217 . Moreover,\nthe incommensurate a-axis modulation with q\u2217a =0.55a\u2217 also exists over the\nsame temperature range along with the spiral-AFM transition. Both of\nthese states collapse near the commensurate AFM transition with q\u2217 =c\u2217\nand TN \u2248 5 K [5]. The Andreev-reflection spectra of HoNi2 B2 C vividly\nmirror these transformations (Fig.4) [16]. Below Tc and down to TN the\nR(V )-spectra cannot be fitted by the BTK model. The shallow dip which\nappears around zero bias has an order of magnitude larger width than that\nexpected for the given Tc . We emphasize that for Tc \u2265 T \u2265 6.5 K the\nAndreev spectra are completely different from those in the paramagnetic\nstate of Dy, Tm and Er compounds. Hence, in HoNi2 B2 C we observed the\nmagnetic transition at the same temperature as the superconducting one,\nbut not at Tm =6.5 K as in the single crystals [17]. It is probable that the\nuncompensated internal magnetic field along the a \u2212 b plane for the spiral\nstructure leads to the gapless behavior of DOS in the temperature region\ndiscussed. Below the AFM transition (T < TN = 6.6 K), the spectra reveal\nthe ordinary BTK behavior. Interestingly, the temperature dependence of\nthe spectra follows the BCS law albeit with a new Tc\u2217 \u2248 6.6 K. The BTK\nfits yield a zero-temperature energy gap \u22060 = 1.04 \u00b1 0.06 meV which\ngives 2\u22060 /kB Tc\u2217 = 3.7 \u00b1 0.2 for lower \"Tc\u2217 \", i.e. the same as for other\nRNi2 B2 C [18]. Using the upper Tc = 8.5 K, one obtains unreasonably low\n2\u22060 /kB Tc = 2.8.\n3. Point-contact spectroscopy of electron-quasiparticle-interaction\nspectral function.\n3.0.4. Principles of PCS.\nThe point-contact spectroscopy (PCS) involves studies of the nonlinearities\nof the I \u2212 V characteristics of metallic constrictions in the normal state,\nwith the size d smaller than the inelastic electron mean free path (m.f.p.)\n[19, 20]. In contrast to a tunneling junction, an ideal point contact has no\nbarrier. PCS has the advantage that the material is probed into the depth\nof the current spreading region, which is of the order of the constriction\nsize. This size should not be too large in order not to violate \u221a\nthe conditions\nof the spectroscopic regime of the current flow: d \u2264 min(lin , lin le ), where\nle and lin are the elastic and inelastic electron mean free paths, respectively.\nIn the ballistic regime (d \u2264 le , lin ), the second derivative of the I \u2212\nV characteristic, dR/dV (V ), is proportional to the electron-quasiparticleinteraction (EQI) spectral function analogous to the Eliashberg function\nfor the electron-phonon-interaction (EPI):\nd ln R\n4 ed\n(V ) =\ngP C (\u03c9) |h\u0304\u03c9=eV ;\ndV\n3 h\u0304vF\n\n(T \u2243 0)\n\n\f5\nHere gP C (\u03c9) is the EQI or EPI spectral function with kinematic restrictions imposed by the contact geometry. The factor 4 (instead of 8 as in\nhomocontacts) is due to weak EPI coupling and much greater vF for the\nnoble metal, as compared to RNi2 B2 C. Correspondingly, the noble-metal\nEPI function is not seen in the spectrum. For the same reason, in the twoband model of RNi2 B2 C [21], only the EQI spectral function for the band\nwith the lowest Fermi velocity and largest EQI is seen in the spectrum.\nIn the spectroscopic regime no heating of the contact area occurs since\nthe energy dissipation length, \u039b\u03b5 , is much larger than the contact size. However, if the contact size is large compared to \u039b\u03b5 , then there is local heating\nand the temperature rises up to T0 \u2243 eV /3.63kB . The thermal feature in the\nPC spectra can be quite large if at a particular temperature Tcr a sharp increase in resistivity occurs like, for example, for the superconducting-normal\nor AFM-paramagnetic transitions. The voltage position of such transition\non the I \u2212 V curve should depend on the input power V /R2 , which means\non the contact resistance.\n3.0.5. Comparison between phonon DOS and EQI spectral function for\nsuperconducting YNi2 B2 C and non-superconducting LaNi2 B2 C.\nIt is very instructive to compare the phonon density of states, measured\nby inelastic neutron scattering, and the EPI (EQI) spectral function, obtained by PCS, for superconducting and non-superconducting compounds\n(Fig.5). For these we choose the nonmagnetic superconducting compound\nYNi2 B2 C and non-superconducting homologue LaNi2 B2 C [22, 23]. The\nphonon spectra measured by neutrons contain three groups of peaks: lowfrequency modes (0\u201330 meV), middle-frequency group (40\u201360 meV) and\nboron high-frequency modes (100\u2013160 meV) [22]. For point-contact spectra, the high-frequency modes cannot be seen as separate peaks because\nof non-spectroscopic (thermal) regime of current flow where the m.f.p.\nbecomes shorter than the contact size. For the same reason, the middlesize peaks are smeared, approaching the thermal regime. On the contrary,\nthe low-frequency peaks are well resolved and can be compared with the\nphonon spectra. It should be noted that the neutron spectra are taken at\nroom temperature while the PC spectra at liquid helium temperature. For\nnon-superconducting LaNi2 B2 C the positions of the low-frequency peaks\nare very close in both spectra (a) and (b) whereas for YNi2 B2 C the whole\nlow-frequency group in PC spectrum (d) is shifted appreciably below the\nneutron one (c). This substantial softening of the low-frequency peaks with\ndecreasing temperature was thoroughly studied in Ref.[24] by neutron scattering. A special problem arises with the low-frequency peak at \u2248 4 meV,\nwhich is not resolved yet. In neutron scattering, the emergence of this peak\ncoincides with the transition to the superconducting state and it is observed\n\n\f6\nwithin a narrow solid angle of phonon wave vectors. In PCS it is seen both\nin the superconducting and sometimes in the normal state whereas in the\nlatter case its intensity is greatly diminished by the magnetic field. Here\nwe remind that in order to measure the PCS spectra the requisite magnetic field should be applied to suppress superconductivity. One should\nalso take into account that the lowest-frequency peak is clearly seen in the\nEPI spectrum which is the phonon DOS weighted by the averaged EPI\nmatrix element within a relatively large (\u223c 45\u25e6 ) solid angle.\nSummarizing the PCS study of EQI function, one can argue that the low\nfrequency modes are characteristic of the superconducting compounds while\nthe behaviour of high energy part of the spectra does not differ appreciably\nfor superconducting and non-superconducting compounds [25, 23, 18].\n3.0.6. Low-frequency phonon and crystal-electric-field excitation peaks in\nErNi2 B2 C\nIn the RNi2 B2 C compound where magnetic and superconducting orders\ncoexist (i.e. R-ion is magnetic), the new branches of excitations appear\nwhich can interact with an electron. These are the magnons at temperatures below the characteristic magnetic transition temperatures (Tm , TN )\nand crystal-electric-field (CEF) excitations. Neutron scattering experiments\nand magnetization measurements show that the characteristic energies in\nthe latter case are absent in the range 2-10 meV in Ho-, and possibly, Dycompounds [26, 27]. In Fig.6 the PC EQI spectra are shown for two different\nErNi2 B2 C-Ag point contacts. Along with the second harmonic curves 1,2,\nV2 (V ), taken in the magnetic field needed to destroy superconductivity, the\nFig.6 shows (insets) the Andreev-reflection spectra R(V ) for the same junctions. These curves serve as a \"passport\" evidencing that there is an intact\nmaterial under the contact. Both PC spectra have a large low-frequency\npeak at about 8-9 meV confirming that this low-frequency phonon feature\nis necessary for observation of the superconducting state. There is an additional structure at about 6 meV which most probably corresponds to the\nCEF-excitation determined in ErNi2 B2 C by neutrons [28, 29]. There is also\na non-identified structure (maximum of R(V )) at zero bias which does not\nbelong to superconductivity.\n3.0.7. Low-energy peaks in HoNi2 B2 C and DyNi2 B2 C compounds.\nThe low-energy parts of the EQI spectra of HoNi2 B2 C and DyNi2 B2 C are\nshown in Fig.7. These compounds possess the same ground state (commensurate AFM order with magnetic moments aligned ferromagnetically along\nthe [110] direction on the RC planes [5]) though with different TN . Their\nspectra are very similar in overall shape while the positions of peaks are\ndifferent. The characteristic energies are hardly due only to the differences\n\n\f7\nbetween the phonon branches since the masses of the constituent atoms\nare nearly the same. Quite definitely, the magnetic excitations should be\ninvolved. This follows from the strong temperature and magnetic field dependences of the intensity and energy position in HoNi2 B2 C [25, 23]. It is\ndifficult to interpret these dependences, since the magnetic phase diagram\nin HoNi2 B2 C is very complicated. Fortunately, it is simpler in DyNi2 B2 C.\nThe unexpected temperature dependence of the lowest-peak for the latter\ncompound is shown in Fig.8 [30]. At lowering the temperature, the lowestfrequency peak appears at about 15 K, much above the superconducting\norder Tc = 6 K and even the magnetic order TN = 10.6 K. Its height and\narea grow linearly with T (see the lower inset), which means that its width\nremains approximately constant. It can also be seen in the superconducting\nstate as a strong feature superimposed on the rapidly changing background\ndue to the superconducting DOS. The other phonon lines (eV = 10 \u2212 30\nmeV in Fig.8) are smeared due to the large background in the PC spectra\nwithout any noticeable overall change of intensity with temperature. We are\ninclined to relate the lowest-lying peak with magnetic excitations (like the\nsame peak at eV = 3.5 meV, Fig,7, in HoNi2 B2 C). It should not be the true\nmagnon density of state peak, since it is observed above TN in DyNi2 B2 C,\nneither it is due to the CEF excitation, since no peak at this energy is\nexpected. Its origin still remains a puzzle. Perhaps it may be attributed to\nthe spin fluctuations which, judging from the neutron measurement, have\na large tail at higher temperatures [5]. In HoNi2 B2 C, the lowest-frequency\npeak mentioned above exists starting at T = 12 K , which is also above the\nmagnetic transition temperature Tm = 8.5 K in this material.\n4. Discussion\nIn literature [31, 32] one can encounter a statement that at least the nonmagnetic compounds RNi2 B2 C (Y, Lu) are similar to A15 superconductors\nin that they have enhanced electron density of state at the Fermi energy\nand their Cooper-pairing mechanism involves phonons [2, 3]. Still, despite\nseveral attempts, no phonon structure was observed above the energy gap in\nthe tunneling characteristics [35, 36, 37, 38]. In the tunneling characteristics\nof A15, a distinct phonon structure is observed with a proper value of the\nelectron-phonon parameter \u03bb [40]. For magnetic RNi2 B2 C, the situation is\neven worse, since the superconducting energy gap is not safely measured\n[35], to say nothing about the above the gap spectroscopic structure. This\nsituation is disturbing and similar to that in high-Tc superconductors where\nno structure is seen above the gap, yet [33, 34].\nContrary to tunneling, the PC spectra show strong electron-quasiparticles\ninteractions both with phonons and magnetic excitations. In principle, they\n\n\f8\ncan be studied both in normal and superconducting [10] states. Interpretation of these spectra is not straightforward, since several electronquasiparticles interactions can interfere with each other. The magnetic\nstructure can hinder the electron-phonon interaction responsible for Cooper\npairing [41, 42]. On the other hand, the superconducting transition may lead\nto a change in magnetic order [43] since it affects the RKKY interaction.\nEven in the non-magnetic compounds, the proximity of the superconducting energy gap to nonadiabatic softening of phonon modes may lead to\ndrastic changes in the phonon spectrum and electron-phonon interaction.\nOnly the systematic study of PC spectra, both in non-magnetic and magnetic compounds in different magnetic fields and at various temperatures,\ncan shed light on the peculiarities of Cooper pairing in these compounds.\nIn this respect, the use of high quality single crystals is invaluable, since\nthe properties of these compounds are often very anisotropic.\nReferences\n1.\n\n2.\n3.\n4.\n\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10.\n\n11.\n\nNagarajan, R., Mazumdar, C., Hossain, Z., Dhar, S.K., Gopalakrishnan, K.V.,\nGupta, L.C., Godart, C., Padalia, B.D., and Vijayaraghavan, R.
