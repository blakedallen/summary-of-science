Though the mathematical treatment is relatively straightforward, several conceptual issues remain\nto be settled. This paper is a sequel to a previous one in which we attempted to clarify some of these open issues in\nthe context of a single oscillator with general time dependent parameters. Here, we shall shift our attention to the\nbroader context of quantum fields evolving in certain time dependent external backgrounds, and in particular try to\nunderstand the relation of particle production with the approach to classicality in terms of phase space correlations.\nWe begin by recalling the basic issues that were raised (and elaborated on) in Paper I [7], that one encounters in\nany semiclassical analysis: (1) In a general time dependent background, there is no well-defined procedure for defining\nthe notion of particles. If adiabatic regions cannot be defined asymptotically, the usual definition of particles in terms\nof in and out states is rendered invalid. (2) A time-dependent particle concept is also required for a proper treatment\nof the question of back reaction of the quantum system on the classical background, which is not an asymptotic\nnotion. many such definitions for 'particles' can be given; our aim is not to come up with a unique definition but\na useful definition and explore its consequences. (3) The standard treatment for computing backreaction in the\nsemiclassical approximation considers only the real part of the effective Lagrangian in determining the modified\nbackground equations of motion. The non-zero imaginary part (which directly quantifies the asymptotic particle\ncontent) is usually ignored in such a calculation, because the resulting equations (and solutions) will be complex (see\nfor e.g. ref. [8]). This leads one to ask whether information about particle production gets encoded in some way in\nthe real part. (4) The concept of particles is intimately tied with the notion of classicality of the state. This issue has\nparticular relevance in studying the generation of primordial perturbations in inflationary cosmology [9\u201313]: in the\nstandard approach, these density perturbations are assumed to be generated as vacuum fluctuations of a quantized\n(inflaton) field, but their late time evolution at super-Hubble scales is treated using classical notions, with the only\nreference to their quantum origin being in the choice of initial conditions. This naturally brings up the question of\nprecisely how something that originates as a quantum mechanical entity can develop classical features over time.\nIn Paper I, we confined ourselves to the case of a quantized time dependent oscillator and presented a general\nformalism to quantify the time dependent physical content of an evolving Gaussian quantum state in the Schrodinger\n\n\u2217 gaurang@iucaa.ernet.in\n\u2020 nabhan@iucaa.ernet.in\n\n\f2\npicture. In particular, we chose to adopt an instantaneous concept of a particle, defining it in terms of instantaneous\neigenstates specified at each moment in close analogy with a simple time-independent oscillator. (We emphasize that\nwe view this as a useful definition rather than a unique definition.) As illustrated by its subsequent application to\nseveral toy examples, this approach provides a physically reasonable picture of the time evolution, with reference to\nparticle content and phase space correlations. The main conclusions reached by our analysis of an oscillator with\na general frequency \u03c9(t) were: (1) Peaking of the Wigner function on the classical phase space trajectory (usually\nassociated with classicality) is a rather general feature that can happen even when the oscillator evolves adiabatically,\ni.e. it is quite independent of the particle production. (2) To make the idea of interpreting classicality less ambiguous,\nwe suggested considering an additional correlation measure (calling it the classicality parameter S); this quantity\nwas found to track the particle creation more closely, and it does not always follow the behavior of the Wigner\ndistribution. Based on an approximate asymptotic analysis of a general \u03c9(t), we identified two distinct late time\nlimits: whenever the oscillator evolves adiabatically (|\u000f(t)| \u001c 1) at late times, particle creation is suppressed and the\nclassicality parameter maintains an oscillatory profile; in contrast, when adiabaticity is violated (with |\u000f(t)| \u2192 \u221e),\nstrong particle production occurs and this is accompanied by a sharp growth in S, whose magnitude saturates at the\nmaximum value of unity.\nHere, we shall exploit the above ideas in the semiclassical context of quantum fields in time dependent external\nclassical backgrounds, laying particular emphasis on making precise the connection of particle production with the\nemergence of classicality in the phase space picture. We will take up two very conventional examples, that of a\nmassless minimally coupled scalar field in an FRW spacetime and a complex scalar field in a constant electric field\nbackground, which will prove to be quite illuminating for our purposes. (These are, of course, very well-studied\nexamples which allows us one to make comparison with previous results.) The form of the action functional in these\ncontexts allows, through a Fourier decomposition, to decompose the field as a set of uncoupled harmonic oscillators,\nwith the time dependence of the background variables getting incorporated in the oscillator parameters. This reduces\nthe field theory problem to one studied in Paper I and our formalism becomes directly applicable. (There is, of course,\nthe standard issue of divergences which arise when one adds up infinite number of oscillators. While this is important\nin a different conceptual context, it is irrelevant for our purposes when we will be dealing with a quadratic action in\na given background. Alternatively, one can imagine that a cut-off is imposed in the Fourier space at high momenta\nand attention is confined to modes well below the cut-off.)\nThis paper is structured as follows. Section II provides a succinct outline of the key ideas of the formalism that\nwas developed in detail in Paper I [7] to analyze a general time-dependent oscillator, placing it now in the broader\ncontext of the field picture. Section III is devoted to a detailed analysis, in Fourier space, of the evolution of a\nminimally coupled real scalar field in expanding FRW spacetimes and of a complex scalar field in a constant electric\nfield background, with particular attention given to particle production and the phase space evolution of the Wigner\nfunction of the quantized field modes. Our results essentially corroborate and strengthen the conclusions that were\ndrawn on the basis of the toy models we analyzed in Paper I, in relation to the dependence of phase space correlations\non the particle production (i.e. adiabatic vs. non-adiabatic evolution). This is followed by a discussion and conclusion\nin section IV. In what follows, we shall set ~ = c = 1.\nII.\n\nFORMALISM\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, we consider here scenarios involving a quantized field, say \u03a6(x, t), coupled to an\nexternal classical background where the action for the field is expressible, by means of a Fourier transform, in the\nfollowing form:\nZ\nZ\n\u0001\n1\n(1)\nd3 k dt mk (t) q\u0307k2 \u2212 \u03c9k2 (t) qk2 .\nA[\u03a6] =\n2\nHere, qk is a real variable associated with the Fourier mode k and stands for the coordinate of the kth oscillator.\nt is the time coordinate and the dot denotes differentiation w.r.t. t. The oscillator variables mk and \u03c9k of each\nFourier mode incorporate the time-dependence of the external background. (To be more precise, if the background\nis characterized by time dependent parameters collectively denoted by C(t), the mass and frequency, being assumed\nto be functions of C, are implicitly time-dependent.) The form of Eq. (1) allows for a mode-by-mode analysis of the\nquantized field to be carried out, once the functions C(t) are specified.\nAlthough we will not go into the details here (for which the reader is referred to Paper I [7]), we provide a quick\nsummary of the Schrodinger picture formalism to study the time evolution of the time dependent oscillator, to set up\nthe notation. We will consider form invariant Gaussian states with vanishing mean [14\u201316] to describe each oscillator,\n\n\f3\nwhich have the general form\n\u03c8(qk , t) = N\n\nexp[\u2212Rk (t)qk2 ]\n\n\u0014\n\nmk \u03c9k\n\u2261 N exp \u2212\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n1 \u2212 zk\n1 + zk\n\n\u0013\n\nqk2\n\n\u0015\n(2)\n\nwhere the wave function has been written equivalently in terms of the either the function Rk (t) or zk (t). Using the\ntime dependent Schrodinger equation, these functions can be shown to satisfy first order (but nonlinear) differential\nequations:\n\u1e58k =\n\n1\n2Rk2\n\u2212 mk \u03c9k\nmk\n2\n\n(3)\n\nand\n1\n\u017ck + 2i\u03c9k zk +\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c9\u0307k\n\u1e41k\n+\n\u03c9k\nmk\n\n\u0013\n\n(zk2 \u2212 1) = 0,\n\n(4)\n\nand we shall denote the quantity ((m \u0307 k /mk ) + (\u03c9 \u0307k /\u03c9k ))/\u03c9k , called the adiabaticity parameter, as \u000fk (t). The problem\nof determining the quantum evolution thus boils down to directly solving for Rk or zk (with an appropriate choice of\ninitial conditions). Alternatively, since Eq. (3) and Eq. (4) are of the generalized Riccati type, they can be transformed\ninto second order linear equations; for example, setting Rk = \u2212 (i mk /2) (\u03bc\u0307k /\u03bck ) where \u03bck (t) is a new function in\nEq. (3) implies that \u03bck satisfies the following differential equation:\n\u03bc\u0308k +\n\n\u1e41k\n\u03bc\u0307k + \u03c9k2 \u03bck = 0\nmk\n\n(5)\n\nwhich is same as the classical equation of motion satisfied by the oscillator variable qk , and the Wronskian condition\n\u03bc\u0307\u2217k \u03bck \u2212 \u03bc\u0307k \u03bc\u2217k = \u2212iW (k)/mk , where W (k) is independent of time, also holds. In some cases, it turns out to be more\nconvenient to solve Eq. (5) rather than start from Eq. (4). But this obviously makes no real difference as zk is trivially\nrelated to \u03bck :\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c9k \u03bck + i\u03bc\u0307k\nzk =\n.\n(6)\n\u03c9k \u03bck \u2212 i\u03bc\u0307k\nAlthough \u03bck (t) (or zk ) completely determines the state of the system, it is useful, particularly from the point of\nview of understanding the physical content of the evolving quantum state, to define a set of variables with physically\nreasonable interpretation, that can be built out of the wave function. For this purpose, following our approach of\nPaper I [7], we consider the following quantities:\n(1) The mean particle number hnk i, that specifies for us the instantaneous particle content of the quantum state\nand is defined using the concept of instantaneous eigenstates. The mean particle number as well as the mean energy\nin a given mode (defined as the expectation value of the Hamiltonian) at any moment t are specifiable in terms of zk :\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n|zk |2\n;\nE\n=\nhn\ni\n+\n\u03c9k (t).\n(7)\nhnk i =\nk\nk\n1 \u2212 |zk |2\n2\n(2) The time-dependent generalization of the effective Lagrangian Lef f (k, t) [3, 4, 10], that specifies the transition\namplitude between instantaneous vacuum states defined at two different moments, which again is related in a simple\nmanner to zk :\n\u0012\n\u0013\ni \u03c9\u0307k\n\u1e41k\nLef f (k, t) =\n+\nzk .\n(8)\n4 \u03c9k\nmk\nThis is to be understood as the contribution of the kth mode to the effective Lagrangian for the field. (This expression\nis somewhat formal since the functional dependence of Lef f (k, t) on the brackground variables is not explicit in this;\nin spite of this, we will see that it is useful.)\n(3) The Wigner distribution function defined in the qk -pk phase space of the oscillator, that provides a reasonable\nmeans of quantifying the approach to classicality of the quantum state in terms of its phase space evolution [10, 14,\n15, 17]. The Wigner function for the Gaussian state in Eq.

(The quantity\nJk \u03c3k2 has the simple interpretation of being just twice the phase space average of qk pk .) Our analysis in Paper I\nsuggested contrasting behavior of the Wigner function and the classicality parameter in different circumstances; the\nclassicality parameter (but not the Wigner function) was shown to closely mirror the variation of hni.\nSince one is dealing with a field here, one can go a step further here and choose to look at the evolution in coordinate\nspace which we could not do in the case of single oscillator studied in Paper I. Consider, in particular, the coordinate\nspace representation of the function zk by taking a Fourier transform and defining a function Z(xi ). Working in\nthe Heisenberg picture, it can be shown that zk is related to the transition amplitude between: (i) a vacuum state\ndefined at some initial instant ti and (ii) a two particle state (with momenta k, \u2212k) defined using the instantaneous\nthe vacuum state at time t:\nzk (t) =\n\nh0, t|\u00c2\u2212k (t)\u00c2k (t)|0, ti i \u22122i\u03c1k (t)\ne\nh0, t|0, ti i\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u03c1 \u0307k (t) = \u03c9k (t) and \u00c2k (t) is the annihilation operator defined at the instant t (see Paper I [7] for a derivation of\nthis relation). Multiplying both sides by exp(ik * r) and integrating over k, we get the real space function:\nZ\nd3 k\n(14)\nZ(r, t) \u2261 zk eik*r\n3.\n(2\u03c0)\nThis quantity has an interesting physical interpretation. If we define the positive frequency part of the field by\nZ\nd3 k\nF\u0302 (x, t) = \u00c2k (t)eik*x\u2212i\u03c1k\n,\n(15)\n3/2\n(2\u03c0)\nthen the state |x, y; ti = F\u0302 \u2020 (x, t)F\u0302 \u2020 (y, t)|0, ti can be thought of as a state with two particles at x and y. The quantity\nZ(r, t) can be expressed as\nZ(x \u2212 y, t) =\n\nh0, t|F\u0302 (x, t)F\u0302 (y, t)|0, ti i\nhx, y; t|0, ti i\n\u2261\n.\nh0, t|0, ti i\nh0, t|0, ti i\n\n(16)\n\nThis quantity can, therefore, be interpreted as the amplitude for the initial vacuum state to appear as a state with two\nparticles at points x and y at the moment t. Obviously it contains some information relating to the quantum versus\nclassical nature of the field. One would have expected the particles to be uncorrelated - so that Z(x\u2212y, t) \u2192 \u03b4(x\u2212y)\n- in the classical context, while the two particles created at two different points to retain a long range correlation in\nthe quantum regime. It is therefore worthwhile to analyze the evolution of this quantity in different contexts.\nSince all the quantities defined above are related to the real and imaginary parts of zk in a simple manner, it is\noperationally convenient to determine zk and then determine the various physical quantities. Our analysis in Paper\nI thus focused on solving for the time-evolution of z in different scenarios involving various functional choices for\n\u03c9(t). In particular, we considered in detail\n\u221a toy models to illustrate the two kinds of late time evolution possible: for\nexample, a frequency function \u03c91 (t) = \u03bb 1 + \u03bb2 t2 , goes over into an adiabatic phase at late times (\u03bbt \u001d 1) with\nthe adiabaticity parameter \u000f(t) going to zero, while another function \u03c93 (t) = \u03bb/(1 + \u03bb2 t2 ), is characterized by a\nstrongly non-adiabatic late time regime (with the magnitude of \u000f(t) diverging as t \u2192 \u221e). We found that the late time\n\n\f5\nbehavior (starting from an instantaneous vacuum state at a sufficiently early moment), while differing appreciably in\ngeneral, shows similarities in certain respects. Although the instantaneous mean particle number follows the expected\nvariation, saturating in the adiabatic example but diverging in the non-adiabatic case, as one would have expected,\nthe Wigner distribution ends up peaking on the corresponding classical phase space trajectory in both situations,\nbeing clearly independent of the nature of the evolution, and is therefore of little use in making a statement about\nthe approach to classicality. This prompted us to also look at the classicality parameter as an additional measure to\ncharacterize the phase space correlations; this quantity was found to closely track the particle production, and like the\nparticle number, showed a clear difference in the two limits, remaining bounded (with oscillations) in the adiabatic\ncase but saturating at unity (corresponding to a diverging q-p phase space average) in the other extreme limit. Taken\ntogether, these features point to potential subtleties involved in interpreting classicality in terms of the phase space\npicture.\nWith a view to exploring these ideas further, we shall now proceed to take up some standard examples appearing\nfrequently in field theory in the semiclassical context, which are expected to further illustrate the two kinds of late\ntime evolution mentioned in the previous paragraph. First, we will consider the often studied Schwinger effect in\na constant electric background, using a complex scalar field. This scenario can be brought into the form of timedependent oscillator by a particular choice of gauge. When expressed in the time-dependent gauge, \u221athis scenario\nbecomes mathematically identical to the toy model corresponding to the frequency function \u03c91 (t) = \u03bb 1 + \u03bb2 t2 we\nanalyzed in Paper I, which was characterized by adiabatic evolution at very early as well as very late times. On\nthe other hand, the second set of examples we consider - evolution of a real scalar field in inflationary as well as\ndecelerating FRW backgrounds - will differ in certain respects from the electric field case, and these will be pointed\nout in the course of our analysis. It may be mentioned that the examples referred to above are very standard, and\nin which particle creation has been extensively analyzed in the literature [1, 6, 10, 14, 18]. But here we will be\nre-examining them in the broader context using the definitions introduced in Paper I which seems to lead to a more\nunified and clearer picture.\nIII.\nA.\n\nANALYSIS OF EXAMPLES\n\nQuantum evolution in a classical electric field background\n\nIt has been known for quite a while that a classical electromagnetic field can have non-trivial quantum effects, like\npair creation out of the vacuum (the so-called Schwinger effect) [3\u20135, 10]. A simple model that suffices to illustrate\nthis situation involves a complex scalar field \u03c6 evolving in a spatially uniform electric background. The electric field\nE(t) can be described in a time-dependent gauge corresponding to Az \u2261 Az (t), with the other components being zero,\nand the action for a scalar field can then be written as [3\u20135]:\nZ\n1\nA[\u03c6] =\nd4 x (\u2202\u03bc + iqA\u03bc )\u03c6 (\u2202 \u03bc \u2212 iqA\u03bc )\u03c6\u2217\n(17)\n2\n1\n=\n2\n\nZ\n\n3\n\nd k\n\nZ\n\ndt |q\u0307k |2 \u2212 (kn2 + m2 + (kz \u2212 qA(t))2 )|qk |2\n\n\u0001\n\n(18)\n\nwith k 2 = kn2 + kz2 . Since the scalar field is complex, each mode k is associated with two degrees of freedom\n(corresponding to the real and imaginary parts of qk ); hence the number of oscillators is twice that in the case of a\nreal field.\nComparing Eq. (18) with the general action in Eq. (1), it follows that the field can\np be regarded as a collection of\nuncoupled oscillators, each with unit mass and a time-dependent frequency \u03c9k (t) = kn2 + m2 + (kz \u2212 qA(t))2 . The\nclassical equation for the variable \u03bck , Eq. (5), takes the form\n\u03bc\u0308k + \u03c9k2 (t)\u03bck = 0.\n\n(19)\n\nWe shall choose the case of a constant electric field E > 0 which can be described by the vector potential A(t) =\n\u2212Et (\u2212\u221e < t < \u221e). This example has been widely studied as a particularly simple demonstration of particle creation\neffects in semiclassical theory, but here we are also interested in considering the phase space evolution of the quantized\nfield.\n\u221a\n\u221a\nBy the transformation \u03c4 = kz / qE + qEt, Eq. (19) can be converted to a simpler form:\nd2 \u03bck\n+ (\u03c4 2 + \u03bbk )\u03bck = 0,\nd\u03c4 2\n\n(20)\n\n\f6\n\u221a\nwhere \u03bbk = (kn2 + m2 )/qE. This corresponds to an oscillator with the time-dependent frequency \u03c9k (\u03c4 ) = \u03c4 2 + \u03bbk .\nFor this frequency function, the adiabaticity parameter given by \u000fk (\u03c4 ) = \u03c4 /(\u03bbk + \u03c4 2 )3/2 vanishes in the asymptotic\nlimits (\u03c4 \u2192 \u00b1\u221e), so in and out vacuum states can be defined in the adiabatic regions. If one starts out in the in\nvacuum state (defined by hnk i \u2192 0 as \u03c4 \u2192 \u2212\u221e), the non-equivalence of the two asymptotically defined vacua implies\nthat the state will appear populated with quanta measured with respect to the out vacuum at late times.\nAs a first step, we would like to understand how the instantaneous particle number, introduced in Paper I, evolves\nwith time. This quantity is, of course, expected to coincide with the definition based on in-out states in the adiabatic\nregions. A computation of the particle content requires one to solve for zk or \u03bck and, for the constant electric field\ncase, Eq. (20) is identical in form to the Schrodinger equation for an inverted harmonic oscillator, which is exactly\nsolvable. We can thus obtain the analytic solution, and this will allow us to determine all the physical properties,\nincluding the exact asymptotic particle content at late times.\nThe linearly independent solutions of Eq. (20) are the parabolic cylinder functions D\u03bdk\u2217 (\u00b1(1+i)\u03c4 ) and their complex\nconjugates [19], where \u03bdk = \u22121/2 + i\u03bbk /2. The particular solution depends on the initial condition chosen. If it is\nassumed that the field modes start out in the instantaneous vacuum state (vanishing particle number) in the asymptotic\npast (\u03c4 \u2192 \u2212\u221e), then the wave function of each oscillator must satisfy\n\u0012\nlim \u03c8k (\u03c4 ) \u2212\u2192\n\n\u03c4 \u2192\u2212\u221e\n\n\u03c9k (\u03c4 )\n\u03c0\n\n\u00131/4\n\n\u03c4\n\n\u0012\nZ\n\u03c9k (\u03c4 ) 2\ni\nexp \u2212\nqk \u2212\n2\n2\n\n\u0013\n\u03c9k d\u03c4\n\n(21)\n\nwhich translates into the following condition on \u03bck :\n\u03bc0k\n\u2248 i\u03c9k (\u03c4 )\n\u03c4 \u2192\u2212\u221e \u03bck\nlim\n\n(22)\n\nwhere the prime denotes differentiation w.r.t. \u03c4 . (qE > 0 has been assumed, so t and \u03c4 have the same sign in the\nasymptotic limits.) The particular solution of Eq. (20) which has the required behavior is D\u03bdk\u2217 [\u2212(1 + i)\u03c4 ]. This may\nbe seen by using the asymptotic form of this function in the \u03c4 \u2192 \u2212\u221e limit:\n\u221a\n\u2217 i\u03c0 \u2217\ni\u03c4 2\nlim D\u03bdk\u2217 [\u2212(1 + i)\u03c4 ] \u2248 ( 2|\u03c4 |)\u03bdk e 4 \u03bdk \u2212 2\n\n(23)\n\n1 \u03c9k0 (\u03c4 )\n\u03bd\u2217\n\u03bc0k\n\u2248 i|\u03c4 | \u2212 k \u2248 i\u03c9k (\u03c4 ) \u2212\n\u03bck\n|\u03c4 |\n2 \u03c9k (\u03c4 )\n\n(24)\n\n\u03c4 \u2192\u2212\u221e\n\nwhich gives\n\nand the \u03c9k0 /\u03c9k term vanishes in the \u03c4 \u2192 \u2212\u221e limit. We next need to obtain the behavior at late times, for which the\n\u03c4 \u2192 \u221e limit of \u03bck is required.

The analytic forms are not illuminating but the plot giving the variation of the mean particle\nnumber as a function of the dimensionless variable \u03c4 - given in figure 1(a) for the choice of \u03bbk = 1 - has several\ninteresting features. The particle number hnk i is nearly constant at very early and very late times as expected. It\nstarts from zero in the asymptotic past, because of our specific choice of initial state. At late times, in the \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e\nlimit, it saturates at the constant value given by Eq. (31). It may be noted that since the variable \u03c4 actually depends\non both the original time coordinate t and the momentum kz , the value of \u03c4 for a given t varies from mode to mode,\nimplying that modes with different momenta would saturate and reach the adiabatic phase corresponding to \u03c4 \u001d 1 at\ndifferent times. More importantly, at intermediate times (when the adiabaticity parameter \u000f is appreciably non-zero),\nhnk i is characterized by oscillatory behavior superimposed on a steadily increasing mean, which can be interpreted\nas a continual interplay of creation and annihilation of quanta. The amplitude of these oscillations gets progressively\ndiminished as the evolution proceeds into the late time adiabatic regime, and the mean settles down at a constant\nvalue. (Though Schwinger effect is extensively discussed in the literature, the authors are not aware of a plot like the\none in figure 1(a) in any of the works.)\nA handle on the nature of the time-evolution of the oscillator can be gained by directly visualizing the evolution of\nzk in the complex plane. This is shown in figure 1(b). The complex trajectory of zk starts from the origin, and after\nmeandering around for a while in the intermediate phase, ultimately ends up, for large values of \u03c4 , on a |zk | = constant\ncurve, corresponding to an asymptotically constant mean particle number.\nWhen we study particle production in cosmological backgrounds - especially in the context of inflationary models\n- it is usual to focus attention on the power spectrum, which is related to the Fourier transform of the two-point\ncorrelation function for the field. To make latter comparison between Schwinger effect and cosmological particle\nproduction easier, we shall compute this for the Schwinger effect. The power in the kth mode is just the variance of\nqk in the given quantum state, and it can be written as\nhqk2 i =\n\n1\n(2hnk i + 1) (hnk i + 1)\n+\nRe(zk ).\n=\n2 (Rk + Rk\u2217 )\n2\u03c9k\n\u03c9k\n\n(32)\n\nThe power, though related to the time dependent mean particle number, is not completely expressible in terms of it,\nbeing also dependent on the phase of zk (the particle number however involves only the magnitude of zk ). Only under\nthe condition of zk taking on a constant value, are the two quantities directly connected. In the present situation, zk\nremains oscillatory in the adiabatic limit at late times while the particle number approaches a constant value, so the\npower, for large \u03c4 , is approximately given by\n!\n\u0012 \u2212\u03c0\u03bbk\n\u0013 \u0012 \u2212\u03c0\u03bbk\n\u0013\n\u2212i(\u03c4 2 +\u03bbk ln \u03c4 )\n2e\n+\n1\ne\n+\n1\ne\nhqk2 i \u2248\n+\nRe\n(33)\n2\u03c4\n\u03c4\nRk\nwhich can be written as\nhqk2 i\n\n1\n\u2248\n\u03c4\n\n\u0012\ne\n\n\u2212\u03c0\u03bbk\n\n1\n+ +\n2\n\n\u0013\nq\n\u0001\n2\n\u2212\u03c0\u03bb\n\u2212\u03c0\u03bb\nk\nk\ne\n(e\n+ 1) cos \u03c4 + \u03bbk ln \u03c4 + rk\n\n(34)\n\n\f8\nwhere Rk = |Rk | exp(irk ).

But this connection is not quite clearcut for two reasons. First, it requires our ignoring the additional oscillatory term which allows us to ignore the phase\ninformation contained in zk . Second, the correlation actually dies down as \u03c4 when \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e and its interpretation\nis unclear. This point will be taken up again when making a comparison with the field theory in the de Sitter\nbackground.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 1: Plots\nof the particle number hnk i and the complex trajectory of zk with time for the constant electric field case\n\u221a\n(\u03c9k (\u03c4 ) = \u03bbk + \u03c4 2 ) for \u03bbk = 1. hnk i saturates at a finite value at late times, zk starts from zero, and at late times ends up\ngoing around in a circle centered on the origin of the complex plane.\n\nLet us now turn to considering the question of quantum versus classical nature in terms of the phase space evolution\nof the Wigner function given by Eq.

This behavior may be compared with that of the\ncorresponding classical phase space trajectory, which, in either asymptotic limit (|\u03c4 | \u001d 1) has the approximate form\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0014 \" 2 \u03bb\n\"\u0015\nh R\u03c4 \u221a\ni\n1\n1\n\u03bbk\ni \u03c42 + 2k ln |\u03c4 |\ni\n\u03bbk +\u03c4 02 d\u03c4 0\nqc \u223c\nRe Ce\n\u2248 p\n1 \u2212 2 Re Ce\n(36)\n4\u03c4\n(\u03bbk + \u03c4 2 )1/4\n|\u03c4 |\n\n\f9\nwhere C is an arbitrary complex constant, with the momentum being\n\u0013\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\" 2\n\u03bb\np\n\u03bbk\nqc\ni \u03c42 + 2k\n|\u03c4 | +\nRe\ni\nCe\npc = q\u0307c \u2248 \u2212\n+\n3/2\n2\u03c4\n4|\u03c4 |\n\n\"\u0015\nln |\u03c4 |\n\n.\n\n(37)\n\nIt is clear that in both asymptotic limits, qc \u2192 0 and the trajectory is along the pk axis. In other words the Wigner\nfunction is concentrated on the classical trajectory both at very early times (when the field is in the in vacuum) and\nat late times (when particle number has reached an asymptotically constant limit. Hence, this aspect (i.e. peaking\non the classical trajectory) of the evolutionary behavior of the Wigner function alone cannot be used in a direct\nmanner to conclude the emergence of classicality. Obviously interpreting classicality merely in terms of peaking on\nthe classical trajectory is suspect, since this can happen even when the oscillator is in a near-vacuum state (which\nhappens to be the case here at early times).\nIt would be of interest to compare the above behavior with that of the classicality parameter Sk defined in Eq. (12),\nfor this situation; its time variation is depicted in figure 3. This correlation measure clearly displays an asymmetry in\ntime and more closely tracks the particle number: Sk stays very close to zero in the course of the early time adiabatic\nevolution, but in the late time adiabatic regime, ends up oscillating about Sk = 0. The oscillatory nature of Sk\nreflects the oscillations of the imaginary part of zk , as it circles around; this becomes obvious by recalling the relation\nconnecting zk with Sk . As is evident from the plot, the time-averaged mean of this oscillatory variation is nearly zero,\nbut the variance of Sk has a non-zero finite value that stays nearly constant in the late time limit. Thus, although\nthe Wigner function provides little help in addressing the question of classicality in this situation, the variation of\nSk points to the state becoming more correlated at late times, basically due to some amount of particle creation\noccurring over time, in comparison with the nearly zero value at early times. Nevertheless, none of these measures\nindicate a clear emergence of classicality in this context. We will see later that the situation is quite different in the\ncase of evolution in the de Sitter background, showing a sharp difference between the Schwinger effect and evolution\nof a quantum field in a deSitter background.\n\nFIG. 3: Variation of the classicality parameter Sk with time for the constant electric field case (\u03bbk = 1). Sk is nearly zero in\nthe asymptotic past, but ends up oscillating about zero with a finite amplitude at late times. The variation of Sk reflects the\ncomplex trajectory of zk , which at late times is a circle centered on the origin of the complex plane.\n\nOne can also determine the form of the time-dependent effective Lagrangian Lef f in the asymptotic limits from\nEq. (8). Using Eq. (24), it can be shown that zk has the following approximate form in the adiabatic early time limit:\n\u0001\ni\nzk \u2248 \u2212 \u000fk (\u03c4 ) + O \u000f2\n4\n\n(38)\n\nwhere \u000fk (\u03c4 ) = \u03c9k0 /\u03c9k2 , and the mean particle number is given by\nhnk i \u2248\n\n\u0001\n\u000f2k (\u03c4 )\n+ O \u000f3 .\n16\n\n(39)\n\nThe asymptotic form of zk allows one to derive an approximation for Lef f in the \u03c4 \u2192 \u2212\u221e limit. The real part can\nconsequently be written as\nReLef f = \u2212\n\ni \u03c9k0\n\u03c9k (\u03c4 )\u000f2k (\u03c4 )\nIm(zk ) \u2248\n\u2261 hnk i\u03c9k (\u03c4 )\n4 \u03c9k\n16\n\n(40)\n\n\f10\nto lowest order in \u000f. This expression has the simple interpretation of being the energy drained from the background\nelectric field due to particle production, \u2212\u03c9k hnk i. (Recall that the effective Lagrangian and effective Hamiltonian\ndiffer by a sign in this case.) Thus, to lowest non vanishing order in \u000f, the real part of the effective Lagrangian\nincorporates information about particle creation during adiabatic evolution starting from a vacuum state, and this\nsuggests that to lowest order in the adiabaticity parameter, the backreaction due to the production of particles can\nbe incorporated using the first term in ReLef f .\nAs for the late time adiabatic limit of large \u03c4 , the asymptotic form of zk in Eq. (28) suggests that at the lowest order,\nthe real part of the effective action (per mode) will pick up dominant contribution over the late time adiabatic phase\nof evolution from the non-oscillatory term of magnitude \u000f2k /16 in the expression for ReLef f . The imaginary part,\non the other hand, is directly related to the asymptotic particle content with respect to the out vacuum state. One\ncan further obtain an expression for the effective action for the field itself, by using the result that the contribution\ncoming from one mode is just (1/4) ln(1 + hnk i) (see Eq.(38) of Paper I). We get:\nImAef f =\n\n\u0001 V\n1X\nln 1 + e\u2212\u03c0\u03bb =\n4\n2\nk\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\u2212\u03c0n\u03bb\nd3 k X\nn+1 e\n(\u22121)\n(2\u03c0)3 n=1\nn\n\n(41)\n\nTo arrive at the last expression we have summed over every k twice, since each mode of a complex field is associated\nwith two degrees of freedom, and used the Taylor series representation of ln(1 + e\u2212\u03c0\u03bb ). The summation over k has\nbeen transformed into an integral by the standard procedure of box normalization with periodic boundary conditions\nover a (large)\nvolume\nR\nR\nRV . The integrand has no dependence on the z-component of the momentum; so making the\nchange d3 k \u2192 dkz 2\u03c0kn dkn and integrating over kn gives\nZ\nImAef f = V\n\n\u221e\n2\ndkz X (\u22121)n+1 (qE)2 \u2212 \u03c0nm\nqE\ne\nqE n=1\nn2\n(2\u03c0)3\n\n(42)\n\nMaking the replacement kz /qE \u2192 T (regarding T as a time coordinate) brings the above expression into the form\nImAef f = V T\n\n\u221e\nX\n2\n(\u22121)n+1 (qE)2 \u2212 \u03c0nm\ne qE\n2\n3\nn\n(2\u03c0)\nn=1\n\n(43)\n\nwhich is of course the same as the standard expression obtained using in-out states [3, 5].\nTo summarize, our analysis of the time evolution in a constant electric field, which maps to a harmonic oscillator\nproblem with late time adiabatic evolution, reproduces all the standard results. In addition it indicates that the\npeaking of the Wigner distribution on the classical phase trajectory to be a fairly general feature, quite independent\nof the amount particle production. It occurs even in the course of adiabatic evolution and in the initial quantum\nvacuum state. The q-p correlation, in contrast, remains bounded and oscillatory in the late time adiabatic regime\nwhere particle production is suppressed, and is evidently more sensitive to the nature of the evolution, viz. whether it\nis adiabatic or non-adiabatic. The relevance of these results will become more apparent when we study the evolution\nin cosmological background.\nWe shall now take up another scenario, that of expanding spacetime backgrounds, and consider time-evolution\nof a quantized field in specific models which illustrate both the kinds of late time evolution: adiabatic as well as\nnon-adiabatic.\n\nB.\n\nQuantum evolution in expanding universes\n\nThe Friedmann model provides an instructive setting for analyzing quantum effects in a time-dependent gravitational\nfield. A spatially flat Friedmann universe [1, 9\u201312] is described by the line element\n\u0001\nds2 = dt2 \u2212 a2 (t) dx2 = a2 (\u03b7) d\u03b7 2 \u2212 dx2 ,\n(44)\nwhere t is the cosmic time, a(t) is the scale factor and \u03b7 denotes the conformal time with d\u03b7 = dt/a(t). We will\nconsider a massless and minimally coupled real scalar field \u03a6 in this spacetime (which, for example, could even describe\nlinearized tensor perturbations [1, 9, 10, 12]), governed by the covariant action\nZ\n\u221a\n1\nA[\u03a6] =\nd4 x \u2212g \u2202\u03bc \u03a6 \u2202 \u03bc \u03a6.\n(45)\n2\n\n\f11\nThe homogeneity and isotropy of the Friedmann metric (44) allows one to decompose the scalar field \u03a6 as\nZ\nd3 k\nQk (\u03b7) eik*x .\n\u03a6(x, \u03b7) =\n(2\u03c0)3/2\n\n(46)\n\nThe Qk are in general complex and can be written as Qk = ak + ibk , ak and bk being real. But since \u03a6 is a real\nfield, Q\u2212k = Q\u2217k and this imposes the constraints a\u2212k = ak and b\u2212k = \u2212bk , which means there actually is only one\nindependent degree of freedom for every k, and this can be chosen to be ak for one half of k-space and b\u2212k for the\nother half. Relabeling these real variables as qk over all of k-space, the action can then be expressed as\nZ\nZ\n\u0001\n1\nA[\u03a6] =\nd3 k d\u03b7 a2 qk02 \u2212 k 2 qk2 ,\n(47)\n2\nwhere the primes denote differentiation with respect to the conformal time \u03b7 and k = |k|. The action (47) describes\na collection of independent oscillators with time dependent mass m = a2 and frequencies \u03c9 = k. The quantized field\ncan thus be analyzed mode-by-mode, and the general formalism developed to study a time dependent oscillator can\nbe directly applied here.\nLet us now quickly recall some standard notions. In an expanding universe (described by a scale factor that is an\nincreasing function of the cosmic time t), all physical length scales get stretched by the factor a(t). Depending on\nthe equation of state of the matter source that drives the expansion, the Friedmann model can undergo acceleration\n(characterized by \u00e4(t) > 0) or deceleration (\u00e4(t) < 0). The scale that determines the dynamics of a field, say, in\nsuch a background is set by the Hubble radius, defined as RH (t) = H(t)\u22121 = (\u0227/a)\u22121 = (a0 /a2 )\u22121 . Any given field\nmode with a comoving wave vector k will have its physical wavelength red-shifted by the a(t) factor, and there are\ntwo possible regimes: one, when the proper wavelength is smaller than RH (sub-Hubble scales) and the other when\nthe mode is 'outside' the Hubble radius, its physical scale exceeding RH (super-Hubble scales). The dynamics of the\nevolution of field modes in these two limits can be qualitatively quite different.\nThe adiabaticity parameter for any given mode in this setting has the form \u000f(\u03b7) = 2a0 /(a|k|) (or in terms of cosmic\ntime, \u000f(t) = 2\u0227/|k| \u221d \u03bb(t)/RH (t)), which is essentially the ratio of its physical wavelength to the Hubble radius.\nThis immediately tells us that in an accelerating universe (characterized by \u00e4 > 0), the adiabaticity parameter is an\nincreasing function of time, so any given mode is expected to make a transition from initially adiabatic to highly nonadiabatic evolution at sufficiently large times, following Hubble exit. This trend will reverse in the case of decelerating\nmodels (\u00e4 < 0) and any mode will eventually end up evolving adiabatically.\nThese features clearly show that this scenario of a quantum field in an expanding gravitational background is quite\ndifferent (conceptually and algebraically) from that of the constant electric field case discussed earlier. In the case\nof electric field the evolution was adiabatic both at early and late times allowing us to define asymptotic vacuum\nstates. Rigorously speaking, we can define an adiabatic in-vacuum at early times in the case of accelerating models\nwhile one can define an adiabatic out-vacuum at late times in the case of decelerating models. In such situations, the\ntime-dependent definition of the particle concept is expected to provide a physically reasonable alternative, and will\nbe adopted in our analysis of the quantized field in the examples which follow.\nOn general grounds, particle creation effects are likely to be significant only in the non-adiabatic, i.e. super-Hubble\nphase of evolution (where \u000fk (\u03b7) \u2261 k/aH & 1). The expectation of strong late time particle production in inflationary\nuniverses, contrasted by saturation of the particle content as well as energy in the decelerating models at large times,\nnaturally follows from this. (We again stress that terms like 'particle production' are used here in a specific sense,\nbased on the idea of instantaneous vacuum, and should not be misinterpreted.)\nThe standard approach to determine the evolution of the system starts with the equation for \u03bck , Eq. (5). (Isotropy\nof the background means that all quantities will be functions of only |k| = k, and this allows us to replace the label k\nby k; we shall stick to this notation from now on.) The solutions of Eq. (5) are usually straightforward to obtain, and\nonce the particular solution for a given initial condition has been chosen, it completely fixes the quantum state.

This set covers accelerating (p > 1) as\nwell as decelerating (0 < p < 1) types. As mentioned before, our intention is to consider examples that illustrate\nthe two possible extreme cases of late time evolution, and the power law models prove adequate for this purpose.\nIn particular, the accelerating models have close correspondence with the toy model of the frequency function \u03c93\nwe considered earlier, which is non-adiabatic at large times, while the non-inflationary ones share the feature of an\nasymptotically adiabatic phase in common with two other toy models (those with the frequency functions \u03c91 and\n\u03c92 ). We shall begin by picking one representative example from each of these two distinct groups, the de Sitter\nmodel and the radiation-dominated model respectively, and try to bring out the essential features that distinguish\n(or are shared in common by) them. Following this, a model combining an initial decelerating phase with a late time\naccelerated period of expansion will be analyzed, and finally a general approximate asymptotic analysis will be carried\nout separately for inflationary and decelerating models.\n\n1. The de Sitter universe\n\nThe de Sitter universe [9\u201312] has exponential a(t) and can describe the inflationary universe. It essentially corresponds to taking the limit of the index p \u2192 \u221e in the power law models with suitable normalization. In terms of the\nconformal time \u03b7, the scale factor is given by\na(\u03b7) = \u2212\n\n1\nH\u03b7\n\n(48)\n\nwhere \u03b7 \u2264 0. The adiabatic parameter \u000fk = 2/k|\u03b7| \u2261 2aH/k clearly blows up as the scale factor goes to infinity. This\nnaturally means that every mode, starting out at sub-Hubble scales at early times, will 'exit' the Hubble radius and\ncontinue to remain super-Hubble thereafter. As indicated earlier, the divergence of \u000fk (\u03b7) indicates the absence of an\nadiabatic out-vacuum state, and hence a natural definition of particles at late times. Consequently, and definition for\nparticle is intrinsically ad hoc and one need to base the discussion on something which is useful. We will see that the\ntime-dependent instantaneous particle concept is a fairly reasonable choice in such a situation.\n\n\f13\nTo determine the time evolution of the quantum state, we will begin with Eq. (5). For the expansion given by\nEq. (48) the general solution for \u03bck can be expressed in terms of simple functions [19, 20] as follows:\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\nik\nik\niaH\niaH\n1\n\u2212 aH\naH\n1\u2212\ne\n+ Rk 1 +\ne\n(49)\n\u03bck (a) = \u221a\nk\nk\n2ka\nwhere Rk is an arbitrary complex number. If one assumes the mode to be set in the instantaneous ground state at\nthe moment a = ai , this corresponds to imposing the condition Rk (ai ) = k a2i /2. The function Rk then turns out to\nbe\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\n\u0013\n2ik\n2ik\nexp \u2212\nRk = 1 \u2212\n.\n(50)\nai H\nai H\nHere, we shall choose to work with a state that begins in an instantaneous vacuum in the asymptotic past; this\nimplies ai \u2192 0, so that Rk vanishes for all k. This state is generally known in the literature as the Bunch-Davies\nvacuum [1, 9, 10], and its evolution will be considered in the analysis which follows. Once the form of \u03bck is specified,\nit is trivial to show that\nzk (a) =\n\ni\n1\n\u2261\n2k\n2ik\ni \u2212 aH\n1 + aH\n\n(51)\n\nwhich is quite simple. From this it follows that the time-dependent mean particle number is given by the following\nexpression:\nhnk i =\n\n|zk (a) |2\na2 H 2\n1\n=\n\u2261\n2\n1 \u2212 |zk (a) |\n4k 2\n4\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bbp\nRH\n\n\u00132\n(52)\n\n\u03bbp being the physical wavelength of the mode. The particle number sharply diverges in the late time non-adiabatic\nregime, i.e. at super-Hubble length scales (k/aH \u001c 1) as the accelerated expansion drives rapid particle production.\nThe time-variation of hnk i as well as the trajectory of zk in the complex plane for the Bunch-Davies state are depicted\nin figures 4(a) and 4(b). zk starts from the origin, and eventually ends up at the limiting point corresponding to\nzk = +1. This is in sharp contrast to the evolution in the case of Schwinger effect, in which the z goes around a\nclosed loop in the complex plane at late times (see figure 1(b)).\nIt may be noted that since the mean particle number here grows monotonically with time, one can trade off the\ntime dependence for dependence on hnk i, and therefore express zk entirely in terms of the mean number of particles:\np\nhnk i\n1\np\n.\n(53)\n=\nzk (hnk i) =\n2ik\n1 + aH\ni + hnk i\nThis in turn allows one to express the wave function, too, explicitly as a function of just the mean particle number:\n\"\n! #\n\u0014 3 \u0012\n\u0013\u00151/4\n4k\n2k 3\nhnk i\nhnk i\np\n\u03c8k (qk , hnk i) =\nexp \u2212 2\nqk2 .\n(54)\n\u03c0H 2 1 + 4hnk i\nH\n1 \u2212 2i hnk i\nThis is possible here only because of a one-to-one relation between a and hnk i. Such a transformation will not be\nunique in general (for e.g. if the mean particle number is oscillatory, the inversion would give multiple values of time\nfor the same hnk i).\nIn the literature, what is normally computed for inflationary models is not the particle number but the power\nspectrum of the field [9\u201311, 13], and we would like to connect it up with the particle concept used above. As\nmentioned earlier, the power in the kth Fourier mode is just the variance of the qk variable in the given quantum\nstate, and is expressible as follows:\nhqk2 i =\n\n1\n(2hnk i + 1) (hnk i + 1)\n=\n+\nRe(zk ).\n\u2217\n2 (Rk + Rk )\n2ka2\nka2\n\n(55)\n\nFrom Eq. (55), it is clear that the power spectrum is not in one-to-one correspondence with the particle content, since\nit also depends on the phase of zk through the Re(zk ) term. It is only under certain conditions - like when zk goes to\na constant value - that a direct correspondence between the two can be established. This is possible, for example, if\n\n\f14\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 4: Plots of the particle number hnk i and the complex trajectory of zk with the dimensionless variable aH/k for the\nBunch-Davies state in the de Sitter model. Sub- and super-Hubble regimes are color-coded blue and red respectively. hnk i\nstarts from zero and diverges at late times. The trajectory of zk , starting from the origin, remains confined to a quadrant in\nthe complex plane, and at late times (super-Hubble scales) approaches the point zk = 1.\n\nthe power is evaluated at super-Hubble scales (k/aH \u001c 1), because in this limit, zk \u2192 1, and from this it also follows\nthat the particle number is large (hnk i \u001d 1). Consequently, we have\nhqk2 i \u2248 2hnk i/(ka2 )\n\n(56)\n\nand thus, at large scales, the power in any given mode does provide a measure of its particle content. Comparing\nEq. (56) with the corresponding equation Eq. (35) in the case of Schwinger effect, we find that there are significant\ndifferences. First, the situation is mathematically much clearer in the case de Sitter universe in which the asymptotic\nlimit of z is unambiguous. This is not the situation in the case of Schwinger effect and one need to drop oscillatory\nterms in a somewhat arbitrary fashion to arrive at Eq. (35). This can be tracked down to the fact that in the case of\nde Sitter universe the late time evolution is highly non-adiabatic while in the case of Schwinger effect the late time\nevolution is adiabatic. As shown in Paper I, the adiabatic evolution generally leads to a late time oscillatory behavior\nfor zk making the relation between power spectrum and particle content ambiguous.\nFor the case of de Sitter evolution starting from the Bunch-Davies state, the power is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\nk2\nH2\n(57)\nhqk2 i = 3 1 + 2 2 .\n2k\na H\nWhen evaluated for every mode at Hubble exit (k/aH = O(1)), this expression yields k 3 hqk2 i \u221d H 2 , corresponding to\na scale-invariant spectrum.\nWe now turn our attention to understanding the quantum versus classical nature of the state. We will start with\nthe evolution of the Wigner function in phase space. The Wigner function is determined in terms of the two variables\n\u03c3k2 and Jk which are given by\n\u03c3k2 (a) =\n\nH2\nk3\n\n\u0012\n1+\n\nk2\n2\na H2\n\n\u0013\n;\n\nJk (a) = \u2212\n\nak 2\nH\n\n\u0012\n1+\n\nk2\n2\na H2\n\n\u0013\u22121\n.\n\n(58)\n\nFigures 5(a),5(b) show the variation of these functions with time. From the above expressions, it is clear that\nJk \u2192 0, \u03c3k2 \u2192 \u221e at early times (k/aH \u2192 \u221e) i.e. sub-Hubble scales, which corresponds to a state that starts sharply\nconcentrated on the q-axis. At late times (k/aH \u2192 0), however, Jk \u2192 \u221e with a finite \u03c3k2 , which causes the Wigner\nfunction to end up peaking on the p-axis.\nLet us compare the above behavior with that of the corresponding classical phase space trajectory. For the case of\nexponential inflation, the general solution for qk in terms of the time coordinate \u03b7 can be written as\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\ni\nqk = Re C\u03b7 1 +\neik\u03b7\n(59)\nk\u03b7\n\n\f15\nwhere C is an arbitrary complex number. Writing C = C ei c , this solution can be re-expressed as\nqk = C \u03b7 cos (k\u03b7 + c) \u2212\n\nC\nsin (k\u03b7 + c) .\nk\n\n(60)\n\n\u0001\nThe conjugate momentum pk = a2 qk0 corresponding to the above qk is then given by\n\u0001\npk = \u2212 C k/H 2 \u03b7 sin (k\u03b7 + c) .\n\n(61)\n\nThe classical trajectory of the system in the phase space thus takes the form\nqk =\n\n\u0012\n\u00131/2\nH 4 \u03b72 2\nH 2\u03b7\np\n\u00b1\nC\u03b7\n1\n\u2212\np\nk\nk2\nC 2 k2 k\n\n(62)\n\nwhere \u03b7 is to be understood as being an implicit function of qk (which can be found by inverting Eq. (60)). At late\ntimes (\u03b7 \u2192 0) i.e. at super-Hubble scales, (qk /pk ) \u2192 0, indicating a trajectory that ends up along the vertical pk\naxis, and this is precisely what the Wigner function gives. As for the other limit of \u03b7 \u2192 \u2212\u221e, we get pk \u2192 0 with\n\u03b7pk remaining finite, which obviously gives a trajectory along the qk axis. This again matches with the analysis\nbased on the Wigner function. Thus, the Wigner function is found to peak on the classical trajectory not only in\nthe non-adiabatic late time phase when strong particle creation takes place, but even at very early times when the\nquantum state of the mode is in fact assumed to be close to a vacuum. This may be taken to suggest that this\naspect of the evolutionary behavior of the Wigner distribution is not sufficient as far as providing information about\nclassicality is concerned. We reached a similar conclusion in the case of the Schwinger effect.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 5: Variation of the dimensionless functions k3 \u03c3k2 /H 2 and H 2 Jk /k3 for the Bunch-Davies state. Sub- and super-Hubble\nregimes are color-coded blue and red respectively. The Wigner function starts uncorrelated and concentrated on the q-axis; at\nlate times (aH/k \u2192 \u221e), q/p \u2192 0 representing a state concentrated on the p-axis.\n\nIn contrast, the classicality parameter gives a more meaningful description here. It can be directly determined from\nEq. (58), and is given by\ns\n(aH/k)\nhnk i\n\u2261 \u22122\n.\n(63)\nSk (a) = \u2212 q\n1 + 4hnk i\n2\n1 + (aH/k)\nLet us look at the asymptotic limits of this expression. At sub-Hubble scales (k/aH \u2192 \u221e), the mean particle number\nis small, and\np\nSk \u2248 \u2212 2 hnk i [1 + O (hnk i)]\n(64)\nwhile at late times, as hnk i grows sharply at super-Hubble scales (k/aH \u2192 0),\nSk \u2248 \u2212 1 +\n\n1\n8hnk i\n\n(65)\n\n\u221a\nto the lowest order. (At Hubble crossing, k/aH \u223c 1 and so Sk \u223c 1/ 2.) It is clear that this quantity Sk follows\nmore closely the particle content, in that it remains close to zero in the initial adiabatic sub-Hubble phase, but grows\n\n\f16\nsubsequently, saturating at unity in the large hnk i limit. (This, it may be remembered, was also found to happen\nin the non-adiabatic toy model corresponding to \u03c93 considered in Paper I [7].) Thus, if Sk is used as a measure of\nthe degree of correlation, then one can unambiguously conclude that the state is evolving towards classicality, which\nagrees with the standard lore in this subject. But note that the Wigner function peaks on the classical trajectory\nboth at early and late times and hence is not such a good descriptor.\nThe plot of Sk for the Bunch-Davies state is shown in figure 6.\n\nFIG. 6: Plot of the classicality parameter Sk for the Bunch-Davies state in the de Sitter model. Sub and super Hubble regimes\nare color-coded blue and red respectively. |Sk | starts from zero in the asymptotic past and saturates at unity at super-Hubble\nscales.\n\nThe contribution to the time-dependent effective Lagrangian coming from the kth mode also can be computed\nusing the expression for zk , and is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\niaH\ni m0k\nk\n1+\n(66)\nLef f =\nzk =\n2\n4 mk\n2k\n1 + a4k\n2H2\nwhere the real part can be rewritten in terms of the mean number of particles in the mode k, as\nReLef f =\n\nk\n1+\n\n4k2\na2 H 2\n\n\u2261\n\nkhnk i\n.\n1 + hnk i\n\nIn the asymptotic past (k/aH \u2192 \u221e), the imaginary part goes to zero, while the real part gives\n\u0001\nReLef f \u2248 khnk i + O hnk i2\n\n(67)\n\n(68)\n\n(recalling that the mean particle number in the Bunch-Davies state vanishes in this limit). To lowest order in hnk i,\nthis can be interpreted as the energy drained from the gravitational field that goes into creating particles, \u2212hnk ik.\nThis again suggests, as in the electric field case, that information about particle production during adiabatic evolution\nstarting from a vacuum state (for the quantum field) is encoded in the real part of the effective Lagrangian, and that\none can take into account backreaction due to the produced particles using ReLef f . This makes sense and lends\nfurther credence to our time dependent definitions.\nIn the other limit of late times (corresponding to k/aH \u2192 0), the imaginary part blows as a consequence of strong\nparticle creation, while the real part assumes the approximate form\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nReLef f \u2248 k 1 \u2212\n(69)\nhnk i\nwhich saturates at the limiting value ReLef f = k asymptotically. Clearly, in this limit where hnk i \u001d 1, the correspondence of ReLef f with particle creation which holds in the adiabatic regime is not valid, and the interpretation of\nthe above expression is presently unclear.\nFinally the physical content of the quantum state can also be clarified in terms of the spatial Fourier transform of\nzk , which, as was shown earlier, can be thought of as the amplitude for a pair of particles to be produced from the\nvacuum at any given instant. This function Z(r, a) is given by\nZ\nZ \u221e\nd3 k\n1\nk\nsin(kr)\nZ(r, a) = eik*r zk\n=\n\u2212\ndk\n(70)\n3\n2ik\n2\n2\u03c0 0 1 + aH\nr\n(2\u03c0)\n\n\f17\nwhich can be written in terms of standard functions:\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0012 2 2\u0013\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0013\u0015\nraH\nraH\nraH\na H\ni\n1\n1\n\u2212 raH\n2 Ei\n2 Ei\n\u2212\nZ(r, a) =\n+\ne\n\u2212\ne\n4\u03c0 2\nr\nraH\n4\n2\n2\n\n(71)\n\nEi(x) being the exponential integral function [19]. While this is not very illuminating, it has clear asymptotic forms\nwhich confirms our interpretation. When a \u2192 0, the second term in the square brackets above vanishes and\n\u0012\n\u0013\naH\ni\n.\n(72)\nlim Z(r, a) \u223c\na\u21920\n4\u03c0 2 r2\nOn the other hand, when a \u2192 \u221e it reduces to a Dirac delta function:\nlim Z(r, a) = \u03b4(r).\n\na\u2192\u221e\n\n(73)\n\n(While one can get this result by a careful limiting procedure, it is obvious from the fact that at late times, zk \u2192 1.)\nThe first limit found above can be interpreted as suggesting that at early times, the particles created at two points are\nstrongly correlated, implying an underlying quantum nature, and the correlation falls off with separation only as r\u22122 .\nThe large a limit of a delta function, on the other hand, implies particles with non-zero separation are uncorrelated,\nin line with the classical notion of a particle as a spatially localized entity. Thus, Z(r, a) provides a measure of the\nclassicality and particle content of the state consistent with what we found earlier.\nTo recapitulate, the de Sitter background provides an example in which the late time evolutions is highly nonadiabatic with no sensible out-vacuum in the conventional terminology. Our formalism, nevertheless produces sensible\nresults - consistent with what have been known in the literature - and shows that the state evolves towards\nclassicality. This is clear in the behavior of the classicality parameter (which increases from zero to unity in the course\nof evolution) and that of Z(r, a) which becomes a delta function at late times. The Wigner function, on the other\nhand, is not a good descriptor of classicality since it is peaked on the classical trajectory both at early and late times\nand does not track the classical trajectory in the intermediate epochs. This shows a contrasting behavior vis-a-vis\nthe evolution in a constant electric field background which leads to adiabatic evolution both at early and late times\nallowing for adiabatic in-vacuum and out-vacuum to be defined. The evolution of the system towards classicality is\nmuch less clear in this case. Altogether, these results closely resemble those found for the non-adiabatic and adiabatic\ntoy examples of Paper I [7].\nWe now move on and choose an example of a decelerating universe, to illustrate the other alternative of late time\nadiabatic evolution. We expect this to present a contrast with the behavior found above and resemble the Schwinger\neffect more closely.\n2. The radiation-dominated model\n\nWe shall now work in the setting of radiation dominated expansion [11, 12], that corresponds to setting p = 1/2.\nThe radiation dominated model is thus governed by the expansion law\na(\u03b7) = a0 \u03b7\n\n(0 \u2264 \u03b7 < \u221e).\n\n(74)\n\nHere, the adiabaticity parameter given by \u000f(\u03b7) = 2/k\u03b7 \u2261 2a0 /(ka) steadily drops to zero with expansion, and particle\nproduction in any given mode is naturally expected to be strongly suppressed in the late time sub-Hubble phase of\nevolution. In fact, in being characterized by a late time adiabatic regime, the radiation dominated model bears close\nresemblance to the constant electric field case that was considered earlier and contrasts with the de Sitter example.\nFor the linear scale factor in Eq. (74), a00 = 0 and the solutions of the classical mode equation Eq. (5) are particularly\nsimple, being just plane waves; the general solution for \u03bck can be written as\n\u0011\na\n1 \u0010 ik aa\n\u03bck (a) = \u221a\ne 0 + Rk e\u2212ik a0\n(75)\n2ka\nRk being an arbitrary constant coefficient. If it is assumed that the mode starts off in the instantaneous vacuum state\n\u22121\nat the moment a = ai , then Rk = \u2212 (1 + 2i kai /a0 ) e2ikai /a0 , and it is straightforward to determine the form of zk :\n\u0010 \u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\na\na\n2ik aa0 Rk e\u22122ik a0 + 1 + Rk e\u22122ik a0\n\u0010 \u0011 \u0010\n\u0011\nzk (a) =\n.\n(76)\na\n2ik aa0 \u2212 1 + Rk e\u22122ik a0\n\n\f18\nIf the state is extended into the past to a < ai , zk \u2192 \u22121 and the particle number is found to diverge as the initial\nsingularity is approached, for arbitrary Rk , and it is not possible to define an instantaneous vacuum state at ai = 0\nwhen the spacetime is singular. Therefore, we have to confine ourselves to states which start off in the ground state at\nsome ai > 0. The behavior of the field mode prior to ai will not be of relevance to us, and we will limit ourselves only\nto the subsequent evolution of the wave function (for a > a0 ). This situation does not occur in the de-Sitter model,\nwhere one is free to choose the initial conditions at arbitrarily early times, like in the case of the Bunch-Davies state\nfor which ai \u2192 0.\nWe are particularly interested in the behavior of the quantum state at large times (ka/a0 \u001d 1). In this limit, zk\nassumes the approximate form\n\u0012 2 \u0013\n\u00112\ni a0 \u0010\na0\n\u22122ik aa\n\u22122ik aa\n0\n0\n1 + Rk e\n.\n(77)\n\u2212\nzk (a) \u2248 Rk e\n+O\n2 ka\nk 2 a2\nThe above expression makes it clear that in the adiabatic late time limit, the mean particle number in any given mode\nsaturates at a finite value:\nlim\n\nka/a0 \u2192\u221e\n\nhnk i =\n\na2\n|Rk |2\n\u2261 20 2 .\n2\n1 \u2212 |Rk |\n4k ai\n\n(78)\n\nThe plot of hnk i (for the particular case where the instantaneous vacuum is chosen at ka/a0 = 1/2) is shown in\nfigure 7(a). Starting from zero, the mean number is characterized by transient oscillations that get steadily suppressed\nas the mode turns adiabatic. Figure 7(b) displays the corresponding complex trajectory of zk which ends up going\naround in a circle centered on the origin of the complex plane, indicative of a finite, asymptotically constant particle\nnumber. These are identical in form to what we found in the case of the constant electric field.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 7: Plots of the particle number hnk i and the complex trajectory of zk as functions of the dimensionless variable ka/a0\nfor the radiation-dominated model, for the case when the initial condition is imposed at ka/a0 = 1/2. Sub- and super-Hubble\nregimes are color-coded blue and red respectively. hnk i saturates at a finite value at late times (sub-Hubble scales). zk starts\nfrom zero, and at late times ends up circling around the origin of the complex plane.\n\nLet us look at the Wigner distribution in this case. It is again described in terms of the following two functions:\na\n\n\u03c3k2 (a) =\n\n1 + Rk e\u22122ik a0\n\n2\n\n(79)\n\n(1 \u2212 |Rk |2 ) ka2\n\nand\n\uf8ee\n\n2\n\n\u0010\n\n\u22122ik aa\n\n\uf8ef 2ka Im Rk e\nJk (a) = \uf8f0\na\n1 + Rk e\u22122ik a0\n\n\u0011\n\n\uf8f9\n\n0\n\n2\n\n\uf8fa\n\u2212 a0 a\uf8fb ,\n\n(80)\n\n\f19\nand these are depicted in figures 8(a) and 8(b). The Wigner function clearly starts off in an uncorrelated state\n2\n(Jk = 0) at a = ai and with a finite spread of magnitude \u03c3k2 = k \u22121 a\u22122\ni . However, at late times, \u03c3k \u2192 0 and this\ncorresponds to a distribution sharply peaked along the p-axis. (This is presumably a consequence of the a \u2192 \u221e limit\nof the scale factor.) As for the corresponding general classical phase space trajectory, it is given, in terms of the\nconformal time \u03b7 by\n\u0012 ik\u03b7 \u0013\ne\ncos(k\u03b7 + c)\n=C\n(81)\nqk = Re C\n\u03b7\n\u03b7\nwhere C = Ceic is an arbitrary complex number. The corresponding momentum has the form\npk = a2 qk0 = \u2212a20 C [k\u03b7 sin(k\u03b7 + c) + cos(k\u03b7 + c)] .\nExpressing qk in terms of pk yields the following expression for a general classical trajectory:\ns\np2\npk\nCk\n1\u2212 4 2 k 2 2\nqk = \u2212 2\n\u00b1p\n2\n2\na0 \u03b7(1 + k \u03b7 )\na0 C (1 + k \u03b7 )\n1 + k2 \u03b72\n\n(82)\n\n(83)\n\nwhere, again, \u03b7 is to be treated as an implicit function of qk , making use of Eq. (81). Every trajectory at the initial\nmoment ai starts from some point (qk (ai ), pk (ai )) in the phase space. But we are particularly interested in the late\ntime behavior here. It is evident that in this limit, qk \u2192 0 and we get a trajectory along the p-axis. This matches with\nthe corresponding limiting form of the Wigner function. Clearly, we here have yet another instance of the Wigner\nfunction showing peaking on the classical trajectory despite the absence of continuing particle creation.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 8: Variation of the dimensionless functions a20 \u03c3k /k and kJk /a20 for the radiation-dominated model. Sub and super Hubble\nregimes are color-coded blue and red respectively. The Wigner function starts uncorrelated at ka/a0 = 1/2 with a finite value\nof \u03c3k2 ; at sub-Hubble scales, \u03c3k2 \u2192 0 causing the Wigner function to get peaked on the p-axis.\n\nThis may be compared with the late time variation of the classicality parameter, which is shown in figure 9. Sk\nis oscillatory with an amplitude less than unity; this of course is a consequence of the nature of the underlying q-p\ncorrelation, which, as can be directly figured using Eq. (79) and Eq. (80), remains finite and oscillatory over the course\nof the late time adiabatic evolution. Recalling the corresponding behavior in the non-adiabatic de Sitter case we dealt\nwith earlier, the evolution, with regard to this feature, differs sharply in the two scenarios (as does the mean particle\nnumber).\nThe imaginary part of the time dependent effective action at late times directly expresses the asymptotic particle\ncontent in the quantum state, and an out-vacuum is definable in the adiabatic region. On the other hand, making\nuse of the approximate expression for zk in Eq. (77) gives the following expression for the real part of the effective\nLagrangian at late times:\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0012 2 \u0013\u0015\n\u0011\u0013\n1 m0k\n1 a0\n1 a0\ni a0 \u0010 2 \u22124ik aa\na0\n\u22122ik aa\n\u22122ik aa\n0 \u2212\n0 + 2R e\n0\nReLef f = \u2212\nImzk \u2248 \u2212\n\u2212\n+ Im Rk e\nRk e\n+O\n.\nk\n4 mk\n2 a\n2 ka\n2 ka\nk 2 a2\n(84)\nExcept for the first term in the brackets, the remaining terms (up to first order in 1/a) are oscillatory in the a \u2192 \u221e\nlimit, so their contribution to the effective action may be expected to be highly suppressed. Thus, the first non-trivial\ncontribution to the effective action from the late time adiabatic evolution comes from the non-oscillatory term with\nmagnitude a20 /(4ka2 ), which is equivalent to \u000f2 (a)k/16.\n\n\f20\n\nFIG. 9: Plot of the classicality parameter Sk as a function of the dimensionless variable ka/a0 for the radiation-dominated\nmodel, for the case when the initial condition is imposed at ka/a0 = 1/2. Sub- and super-Hubble regimes are color-coded blue\nand red respectively. Sk at late times ends up oscillating about zero with a finite [constant] amplitude. The variation of Sk\nreflects the complex trajectory of zk , which at late times is a circle centered on the origin.\n\nBased on the analysis carried out above, combined with that of the de Sitter model, it is evident that peaking of\nthe Wigner function on the corresponding classical phase trajectory at late times is a fairly general feature, seemingly\nindependent of the adiabatic vs. non-adiabatic nature of the time evolution. In contrast, the classicality parameter,\nproviding an alternative handle to quantify the variation of the Wigner distribution, shows appreciably dissimilar\nbehavior in the two examples, and bears a rather close relation with particle production. As alluded to earlier, these\nobservations are pretty much similar to the results obtained our in the toy models in Paper I revealed.\nThe analysis of the preceding sections brings out the contrast of time evolution of quantized field modes in the\ninflationary scenario with that in the electric field case, and we would like to emphasize it once again here. A\ncomparison of the plots for various quantities evaluated for the de Sitter case in section III B with those in section III A\nmakes this point amply clear. In particular, a constant electric background provides adiabatic in as well as out regions\nwhere the notion of a particle can be unambiguously defined, which is not the case for the de Sitter model, where the\nlate time evolution is highly non-adiabatic. Moreover, the power spectrum (related to the two-point function for the\nfield) of field modes does not provide a direct measure of the particle content in the adiabatic limit in the electric field\nscenario (see Eq. (32)) due to the asymptotically oscillatory nature of zk ; in contrast, for the de Sitter background, as\nis clear from Eq. (55) such a correspondence is made possible in the late time non-adiabatic phase of evolution where\nzk \u2192 1. As pointed out before, the electric field case is qualitatively much closer to a decelerating universe like the\nradiation-dominated example, at least in being characterized by a late time adiabatic phase. The similarities in the\nnature of the plots in sections III A and III B make this fairly clear.\n4. A radiation-dominated universe going over to an asymptotically de Sitter phase\n\nWe would like to provide another illustration of our formalism by considering quantized field evolution in a cosmological model which decelerates (radiation-dominated) initially before making a transition to a de Sitter phase of\naccelerated expansion. The Friedmann equation for the scale factor describing such a universe [11] is given by\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u0011\n8\u03c0G \u0010 \u03c1r0\n\u0227\n=\n+ \u03c1\u039b\n(85)\n4\na\n3\na\n(\u03c1r0 being the radiation energy density at a = a0 \u2261 1) and the solution in terms of the cosmic time t has the form\n\u0012\na(t) =\n\n\u03c1r0\n\u03c1\u039b\n\n!#1/2 \u0012\nr\n\u00131/4 \"\n\u00131/4\n8\u03c0G\n\u03c1r0\n1/2\nsinh 2\n\u03c1\u039b t\n\u2261\n(sinh (2\u03c4 ))\n3\n\u03c1\u039b\n\n(86)\n\nq\nwhere we have introduced the dimensionless variable \u03c4 \u2261 8\u03c0G\n3 \u03c1\u039b t.\nThe adiabaticity parameter \u000fk corresponding to this expansion factor diverges in both extreme limits (a \u2192 0 and\na \u2192 \u221e), so asymptotic in and out states are not definable. Nonetheless, one can solve Eq. (4) to determine the time\nevolution of the quantum state of every mode.\n\n\f21\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFIG. 10: Plots of the particle number hnk i, complex trajectory of zk and classicality parameter Sk as functions of the dimensionless variable \u03c4 for the radiation+Lambda model. The instantaneous ground state is imposed at \u03c4 = 0.001, and\nradiation-dominated and Lambda-dominated phases have been color-coded blue and red respectively. hnk i diverges at late\ntimes (super Hubble scales). zk , after circling around for a while, asymptotically ends up at zk = 1. This is reflected in the\nevolution of Sk , which oscillates in the intermediate sub Hubble phase before saturating at unity.\n\nFigures 10(a), 10(b) and 10(c) show the numerical solutions for the mean number of particles, complex path of zk\np\n1/4\nand classicality parameter for a mode k corresponding to 3/8\u03c0Gk/ (\u03c1r0 \u03c1\u039b0 )\n= 10, plotted against the variable\n\u03c4 . Here, the initial condition zk = 0 has been imposed at \u03c4 = 0.001 (which corresponds to RH /\u03bbp = 0.5) and the\nradiation-dominated and Lambda-dominated phases have been color-coded blue and red respectively. The average\nparticle number, after a short period of transient oscillations (when the mode is temporarily inside the Hubble radius)\nmonotonically increases at late times, and this mirrors the behavior of zk , which circles around the origin for a while\nbefore finally winding up at the point zk = 1. The behavior of Sk , saturating at unity after a phase of oscillatory\nvariation, follows from this. In fact, one can see pretty clearly that the plots for this model can be thought of as\nobtained by 'patching up' the corresponding plots for the pure radiation-dominated and de Sitter examples which\nwere considered earlier. Our time-dependent formalism thus provides a convenient way to visualize the differences in\nmode evolution during the decelerating and accelerating phases of expansion.\n\n5. Approximate analysis of accelerating models\n\nWe would now like to verify that the features suggested by the preceding examples are fairly generic, i.e. they\nhold to a reasonable extent for all power law models (i.e. for all values of the index p). To this end, an approximate\n\n\f22\nanalysis of the time evolution for arbitrary p is outlined below. We will first consider the range p > 1 corresponding\nto inflation, followed by the case of decelerating models with 0 < p < 1.\nThe accelerating models are described by the following scale factor [14]:\na(t) = a0 tp\n\n(p > 1)\n\n(87)\n\nwhich, in terms of the conformal time coordinate can be re-expressed as\na(\u03b7) = (\u2212H\u03b7)\u03b3+1\n\n(\u2212\u221e < \u03b7 < 0)\n\n(88)\n\n1/p\n\nwhere \u03b3 = (2p \u2212 1)/(1 \u2212 p) with \u03b3 \u2264 \u22122 and H = (p \u2212 1)a0 . De Sitter inflation is a particular example belonging to\nthis set, and corresponds to the choice \u03b3 = \u22122. Needless to say, all these models are characterized by non-increasing\nHubble radius, and the evolution of every field mode turns strongly non-adiabatic at late times following Hubble\ncrossing.\nWe would like to consider a scenario where the quantum state of any mode starts out in the instantaneous vacuum\nin the asymptotic past. The solution to the equation for \u03bck , Eq. (5), which gives vanishing particle number in the\n\u03b7 \u2192 \u2212\u221e limit is given by\n\u03bck (\u03b7) = N (k\u03b7)\u03bd H\u03bd(1) (k\u03b7)\n\n(89)\n\n\u221a\nwhere N = \u03c0/2k \u03bd and \u03b3 has been replaced by the new variable \u03bd = \u2212\u03b3 \u2212 1/2; the normalization has been chosen\n0\u2217\nso that \u03bck \u03bck \u2212 \u03bc0k \u03bc\u2217k = \u2212i/a2 , so the Wronskian is set equal to unity.\nFixing the form of \u03bck , in principle completely specifies the time evolution of the state in all respects. Since we\nhowever are particularly interested in determining the late time behavior, the \u03b7 \u2192 0 limit of the various quantities will\nbe considered. Let us start with the solution for \u03bck in Eq. (89). At super-Hubble scales (k|\u03b7| \u001c 1), the approximate\nform of the Hankel function is given by\nH\u03bd(1) (k\u03b7) \u2248 A\n\n\u0012\n\nk\u03b7\n2\n\n\u0013\u2212\u03bd\n\n\u0012\n+B\n\nk\u03b7\n2\n\n\u00132\u2212\u03bd\n(90)\n\nwhere\nA=\u2212\n\ni\n\u0393(1 \u2212 \u03bd) sin \u03c0\u03bd\n\n,\n\nB=\n\ni\n\u0393(2 \u2212 \u03bd) sin \u03c0\u03bd\n\n(91)\n\nand so\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03bck (\u03b7) \u2248 N 2\u03bd A + 2\u03bd\u22122 B(k\u03b7)2 + O(\u03b7 2+\u03bb )\n\n,\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03bc0k (\u03b7) \u2248 N 2\u03bd\u22121 Bk 2 \u03b7 + O(\u03b7 1+\u03bb )\n\n(\u03bb > 0).\n\n(92)\n\nThis gives the following approximation for the energy in the mode at late times (super-Hubble scales) to the lowest\norder of approximation:\nEk =\n\n\u0001\na2\n22\u03bd\u22123 \u03c0k\n1\u22122\u03bd\n1\u22122\u03bd\n|\u03bc0k |2 + k 2 |\u03bck |2 \u2248 22\u03bd\u22123 \u03c0k|A|2 (k\u03b7)\n\u2261\n(k\u03b7)\n2\n2\n(\u0393(1 \u2212 \u03bd)) sin2 \u03c0\u03bd\n\n(93)\n\nSince \u03bd \u2265 3/2 for this class of models (corresponding to p > 1), the energy in every mode diverges at sufficiently late\ntimes (k\u03b7 \u2192 0). This also means that the mean number of particles, being directly related to the energy, diverges as\nwell:\nhnk i =\n\nEk\n1\nEk\n22\u03bd\u22123 \u03c0\n1\u22122\u03bd\n\u2212\n\u2248\n\u2248\n(k\u03b7)\n.\n2\n2\nk\n2\nk\n(\u0393(1 \u2212 \u03bd)) sin \u03c0\u03bd\n\n(94)\n\nLet us now move over to the phase space and consider the behavior of the corresponding Wigner function at late\ntimes; this is specified in terms of the functions \u03c3k2 and Jk , whose late time approximations have the forms\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03c3k2 = 2|\u03bck |2 \u2248 N 2 22\u03bd |A|2 + 22\u03bd\u22122 (AB \u2217 + A\u2217 B)(k\u03b7)2\n(95)\nand\n\u0012\nJk =\n\na2\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0003\n1 d|\u03bck |2\n(\u2212H\u03b7)2\u03b3+2 \u0002\n\u2248\n1 + O(k 2 \u03b7 2 ) .\n|\u03bck |2 d\u03b7\n2\n\n(96)\n\n\f23\nIt is clear that \u03c3k2 has a finite limiting value, while Jk is an increasing function of time, and diverges at super-Hubble\nscales. This represents a Wigner function that sharply peaks on the p-axis at late times.\nIn contrast, in the asymptotic past as zk \u2192 0, \u03c3k2 \u221d a\u22122 \u2192 \u221e while Jk \u2192 0, describing a Wigner function that\npeaks around the q-axis.\nThe behavior of the Wigner function needs to be compared with that of the corresponding classical trajectory in\nphase space. A general solution to the classical equation of motion is given by\nh\ni\nqk = Re C\u03b7 \u03bd H\u03bd(1) (k\u03b7)\n(97)\nwhere C is an arbitrary complex constant. At sufficiently early times (\u03b7 \u2192 \u2212\u221e), using the asymptotic form of the\nHankel function, it can be shown that\nr\ni\n\u0010\nh\n1\n\u03c0\u03bd\n2\n\u03c0\u0011\n\u03c6=\u2212\n(98)\nRe C\u03b7 \u03bd\u2212 2 ei(k\u03b7+\u03c6)\n\u2212\nqk \u2248\n\u03c0k\n2\n4\nwhile the conjugate momentum is given by\nr\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0015\n\u0010\n2\n1\n2 0\n1\u22122\u03bd\n\u2212\u03bd\u2212 21 i(k\u03b7+\u03c6)\n\u2212\u03bd+ 12 i(k\u03b7+\u03c6)\npk = a qk \u2248 (\u2212H)\n\u2212 k Im C\u03b7\n\u03bd\u2212\nRe C\u03b7\ne\ne\n\u03c0k\n2\n\n(99)\n\nwhich implies that in the asymptotic past, pk \u2192 0 with an oscillatory qk whose amplitude sharply increases in the\n\u03b7 \u2192 \u2212\u221e limit, and the classical trajectory starts close to the q-axis. In contrast, at late times (k|\u03b7| \u001c 1), we have\n\"\n\u0012 \u0013\u03bd\n\u0012 \u0013\u03bd\u22122 !#\n2\n2\nqk \u2248 Re C A\n+B\n\u03b72\n(100)\nk\nk\nwith the corresponding momentum being\npk =\n\na2 qk0\n\n\u2248 2(\u2212H)\n\n1\u22122\u03bd\n\n\u0012 \u0013\u03bd\u22122 !\n2\nRe CB\n\u03b7 2\u22122\u03bd .\nk\n\n(101)\n\nSince \u03bd \u2265 3/2, qk /pk \u2192 0 as \u03b7 \u2192 0, and we have a trajectory that ends up on the p-axis. Thus, based on the above\nlimits one concludes that the Wigner function,for all p > 1, peaks on the classical trajectory in both asymptotic regions.\nThis generalizes to all accelerating power law models what was earlier found for the de Sitter case, namely that this\naspect (peaking on the classical trajectory) of the Wigner function may not provide much information regarding the\napproach to classicality.\nFurthermore, using the approximations for \u03c3k2 and Jk in Eqs. (95) and (96), it trivially follows that the q-p correlation\n(being just the product Jk \u03c3k2 ) will diverge as Jk \u2192 \u221e at late times, implying a classicality parameter which ends up\nsaturating at unity, accompanying strong particle production. This feature, too, was found to occur in the de Sitter\nexample, and now has been generalized to all accelerating models of the type a \u221d tp .\nWe will now move on to examine the other class, that of decelerating models, and explore the generality of the\nfeatures the radiation-dominated model taken up earlier suggested.\n6. Approximate analysis of decelerating models\n\nThese models are characterized by the scale factor\na(t) = a0 tp\n\n(0 < p < 1)\n\n(102)\n\nand in terms of conformal time, have the form\na(\u03b7) = (\u2212H\u03b7)\u03b3+1\n1/p\n\n(0 < \u03b7 < \u221e)\n\n(103)\n\nwhere \u03b3 = (2p \u2212 1) / (1 \u2212 p) and H = (p \u2212 1)a0 . In contrast with the situation in accelerating models, the adiabatic\nparameter given by \u000fk = 2/k\u03b7 is strongly suppressed in the late time sub-Hubble regime (k\u03b7 \u2192 \u221e).\nLike in the previous case, we would like to focus on the late time behavior of various quantities associated with the\nevolving quantum state. So we start with the general solution to Eq. (5), which is given by\n\u221a\ni\n\u03c0\u03b7 h\n\u03bck (\u03b7) =\nAk H\u03bd(1) (k\u03b7) + Bk H\u03bd(2) (k\u03b7)\n(104)\n2a(\u03b7)\n\n\f24\nwhere \u03bd = \u2212\u03b3 \u2212 (1/2). It should be recalled that the \u03b7 \u2192 0 limit here is highly non-adiabatic, so a natural in-vacuum\nstate is not definable in this region. We will therefore just work under the assumption that the state is chosen to\ncoincide with the instantaneous vacuum at some moment \u03b7 = \u03b7i , which basically fixes Bk /Ak . At sufficiently late\ntimes, however, every mode (in any arbitrary state) will eventually turn sub-Hubble and evolve adiabatically, so we\nhave, for large values of k\u03b7,\n\u03bck (\u03b7) \u2248 \u221a\n\n\u03c0\u03bd\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\u0001\n\u03c0\u03bd\n1\nAk eik\u03b7\u2212i 2 \u2212i 4 + Bk e\u2212ik\u03b7+i 2 +i 4\n2ka(\u03b7)\n\n(105)\n\nwhich gives the following approximation for zk at late times:\nzk (\u03b7) \u2248 Rk e\u22122ik\u03b7 \u2212 i(1 + Rk e\u22122ik\u03b7 )2\n\n\u0001\n(1 \u2212 2\u03bd)\n+ O (k\u03b7)\u22122\n4k\u03b7\n\n(106)\n\nwhere Rk = (Bk /Ak ) exp (i\u03c0\u03bd + i\u03c0/2). Using this approximate expression, one can derive approximations for the\nparticle number as well as the correlation parameter in the adiabatic limit:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0001\n(1 \u2212 2\u03bd) Im(Rk e\u22122ik\u03b7 )\n|Rk |2\n\u22122\n1\u2212\n+ O (k\u03b7)\n(107)\nhnk i \u2248\n1 \u2212 |Rk |2\n2k\u03b7\n|Rk |2\n\u0001\n\u0001\nwhich implies that the particle number saturates at the finite value |Rk |2 / 1 \u2212 |Rk |2 \u2261 |Bk |2 / |Ak |2 \u2212 |Bk |2 , and\nJk \u03c3k2\n\n2Im(Rk e\u22122ik\u03b7 ) (1 \u2212 2\u03bd)\n2Imzk\n\u2248\n\u2212\n=\n1 \u2212 |zk |2\n1 \u2212 |Rk |2\n2k\u03b7\n\nRe(1 + Rk e\u22122ik\u03b7 )2 + 2 Im(Rk e\u22122ik\u03b7 )\n1 \u2212 |Rk |2\n\n\u00012 !\n\n\u0012\n+O\n\n1\n2\nk \u03b72\n\n\u0013\n. (108)\n\nIn the late time limit (k\u03b7 \u2192 \u221e), only the first oscillatory term survives, and describes a correlation function that\noscillates with a finite amplitude. Thus, as particle production is suppressed in the adiabatic limit, the q-p correlation\nremains bounded, generalizing the behavior which was found earlier in the radiation dominated model.\nFrom the expressions for \u03c3k2 and Jk (see table), it is clear that in the strongly adiabatic limit (k\u03b7 \u2192 \u221e) since |zk |\ndoes not go to unity, the behavior of these functions is primarily determined by the late time limit of mk \u2261 a2 ; this\nimplies \u03c3k2 \u2192 0 while Jk is oscillatory (due to the oscillatory nature of zk ) with an amplitude that is proportional to a2 ,\ndescribing a Wigner function that progressively gets peaked on the p-axis at late times. The Wigner function, however,\nwas started off at \u03b7 = \u03b70 in an uncorrelated state (Sk = 0) that is fairly spread out (with \u03c3k2 (\u03b7i ) = k \u22121 a\u22122 (\u03b7i )). Thus\nthe Wigner function gets sharply peaked with time even though the mean particle number remains finite all along.\nAs for the classical trajectory, it has the same form as in the p > 1 models, Eq. (97); however, the late time limit here\ncorresponds to taking \u03b7 \u2192 \u221e, and this gives\nr\nh\ni r 2\n1\n2\n\u03bd\u2212 21 i(k\u03b7+\u03c6)\nqk \u2248\nRe C\u03b7\ne\n\u2261\nC\u03b7 \u03bd\u2212 2 cos (k\u03b7 + \u03c6 + c)\n(109)\n\u03c0k\n\u03c0k\nwhere C has been written as Ceic , and\nr\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\n1\n2\n2 0\n1\u22122\u03bd\n\u2212\u03bd\u2212 12\n\u2212\u03bd+ 12\n\u03bd\u2212\npk = a qk \u2248 (\u2212H)\nC\n\u03b7\ncos (k\u03b7 + \u03c6 + c) \u2212 k\u03b7\nsin (k\u03b7 + \u03c6 + c) .\n\u03c0k\n2\n\n(110)\n\nSince \u03bd < 1/2 for 0 < p < 1, we have qk (\u03b7) \u2192 0 as \u03b7 \u2192 \u221e, and the classical trajectory (for arbitrary C) ends up\non the p-axis, matching with the late time behavior of the Wigner distribution. As in the case of the classicality\nparameter above, this too is a generalization of what was seen in the radiation-dominated example.\nTo conclude, based on the approximate analysis of the last couple of subsections, the two distinct late time limits of\npower law expansion, adiabatic vs. non-adiabatic, show clearly differing behavior as regards particle production and\nvariation of the classicality parameter (found to be sensitive to the particle creation) providing one possible measure\nof phase space correlations. Peaking of the Wigner function on the classical trajectory, on the other hand, is a fairly\ngeneral feature, happening whenever one of the oscillator parameters blows up/goes to zero, and is quite independent\nof the particle production, i.e. adiabatic vs. non-adiabatic evolution. The observations drawn here, it may be noted,\nare broadly similar to, and thus to an extent corroborate, what we learned from the various toy models dealt with in\nPaper I.\n\n\f25\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn the previous sections, we have attempted to shed some light on a few conceptual issues arising in the study of\nthe quantized time dependent oscillator, focusing our attention on a couple of conventional examples drawn from field\ntheory in external backgrounds that hold particular physical relevance; this has been intended as an exploitation of\nthe analysis (based on the Schrodinger picture formalism) that was carried out in Paper I.

This renders the interpretation of classicality based solely on peaking on the classical\ntrajectory dubious, and naturally brings in the need to have an additional measure to specify the degree of correlation,\nif one seeks to address the question of approach to classicality confining oneself solely to the phase space evolution of\nthe system. Our choice of the classicality parameter, which is found to closely track the particle production, proves\nfairly reasonable in this regard and is seen as having a more sensible interpretation in some situations, like being zero\nin a vacuum state even though the Wigner function may peak in this limit etc..\nLet us reconsider the various limiting cases we came across in our examples in a step-by-step manner. First, let us\nconsider the limit of early times. For all three cases considered, the function Jk as well as the classicality parameter\nSk vanish at the moment when the mode is started off in the instantaneous ground state, and this clearly represents\nan uncorrelated Wigner distribution, although it is peaked in a limited region in phase space. (In the de Sitter and\nelectric field cases, one can start off in the instantaneous vacuum state at t = \u2212\u221e, but for the radiation dominated\nuniverse, a non-zero initial time \u03b7i is chosen.)\nAs for the late-time behavior, the three examples differ in specific respects. For the de Sitter model, \u03c3k2 approaches\na finite limiting value while Jk blows up. It can also be seen that the classicality parameter smoothly goes to unity\nin the a \u2192 \u221e limit [while it remains nearly zero at sub-Hubble scales in the asymptotic past]. Clearly, these features\nare indicative of a fairly correlated phase space distribution, and this is in line with the usual conclusion of classicality\nemerging on super-Hubble scales [10, 14, 17, 18]. For the radiation-dominated case, the Wigner distribution ends up\ngetting peaked on the p-axis (coinciding with the corresponding classical trajectory) at late times on account of the\nfact that \u03c3k2 \u2192 0.\nAs regards the variation of the classicality parameter, it turns out that this measure is zero to start with (at the\ninstant when the mode is in the instantaneous ground state) but subsequently (for \u03b7 > \u03b70 ) develops an oscillatory\nprofile that has a finite amplitude at late times. So, it can probably be argued that in some sense, the state gets\n\n\f26\nsignificantly more correlated in comparison with the initial state, although this is in contrast with the de-Sitter case\n[where Sk \u2192 1 at late times], and is not so obvious. The difference is clearly tied with the adiabatic vs. non-adiabatic\nnature of the late time evolution.\nFinally, for the electric field example, the late time variation qualitatively proceeds along lines similar to the\nradiation-dominated model, in that \u03c3k2 \u2192 0, representing a Wigner function peaked on the p-axis [and which coincides\nwith the classical trajectory]. However, the classicality parameter exhibits a variation that's more straightforward to\ninterpret: it vanishes in the asymptotic past (Sk \u2192 0 as t \u2192 \u2212\u221e) but is oscillatory with a finite, nearly constant\namplitude in the t \u2192 \u221e limit. So in terms of Sk , the phase space correlations clearly appear to grow more significant\nin the far future in relation to early times. The de Sitter and electric field cases thus display a fairly unambiguous\nemergence of phase space correlations with time, but the evolution in the radiation model, in this particular respect,\nis a little less clear. The bottom line, thus, is that particle production is not necessary for peaking of the Wigner\nfunction on the classical trajectory as the three examples that were considered indicate, where this was found to\nhappen even as hnk i saturated at late times or decreased to zero in the asymptotic past. (It may however be noted\nthat one or the other of the oscillator parameters blows up/goes to zero in these limits.) Our analysis thus points\ntoward the fact that peaking on the classical trajectory alone need not suffice to regard a system as turning classical;\none needs to supplement this criterion with looking at some sensible measure of phase space correlations to settle this\nquestion. The classicality parameter that we have used is a simple yet useful construct in this regard, and leads one\nto conclude that strong particle creation, although not necessary for causing the Wigner function to get concentrated\non the classical trajectory, is a necessary condition for driving the quantum state to become highly correlated (i.e.\nhqpi \u2192 \u221e).\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nG.M. is supported by the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research, India.\n\n[1] V.
