Introduction\nDenote by S\u03b4 the space of contravariant symmetric tensor fields with\ncoefficients in \u03b4-densities over Rn and by D\u03bb,\u03bb+\u03b4 the space of differential\noperators acting between spaces of densities of weight \u03bb and \u03bb + \u03b4. A\nprojectively equivariant quantization procedure over Rn , as introduced by\nP. Lecomte and V. Ovsienko in [22], is a linear bijection from S\u03b4 to D\u03bb,\u03bb+\u03b4\nthat intertwines the actions of the Lie algebra pgl(n + 1) of infinitesimal\nprojective transformations on both spaces. This bijection is required to\nsatisfy a natural normalization condition (see Formula (5)).\nIn their seminal work [22], P. Lecomte and V. Ovsienko showed the existence and uniqueness of the projectively equivariant quantization in the\ncase \u03b4 = 0. This result was generalized in [11] for arbitrary \u03b4 \u2208 R \\ C, where\nC is a set of critical values.\nVarious generalizations of these results were considered so far. Let us mention [9, 23, 3, 4] for the analysis of equivariant quantizations over Euclidean\nspaces, [6, 7, 10, 25] for first steps towards the definition of such quantizations over arbitrary manifolds, [24] for the formal definition of natural and\nprojectively invariant quantization procedures over arbitrary manifolds and\nfinally [5, 16, 29, 12, 17, 27, 28, 26, 34, 35, 36, 8] for existence theorems\n(for non-critical situations) and several independent constructions for such\nquantization procedures in more and more general contexts.\nDate: November 2, 2018.\n1\n\n\fPROJECTIVELY EQUIVARIANT QUANTIZATIONS\n\n2\n\nRecently, several papers dealt with the problem of equivariant quantizations in the context of supergeometry: first, in [13, 30] the problem of\nequivariant quantizations over the supercircles S 1|1 and S 1|2 was considered (with respect to orthosymplectic superalgebras). Second, the thesis\n[31] dealt with conformally equivariant quantizations over supercotangent\nbundles. Finally, a result extending to supergeometry the theory of projectively invariant quantization appeared in [14] where it was shown that,\ngiven a supermanifold endowed with a projective class of superconnections,\nit is possible to associate a differential operator of order two to any supersymmetric tensor field in a projectively invariant way.\nThe similarity between the formula appearing in that paper (see [14, Theorem 3.2]) and the explicit formulas in the context of pgl(n + 1)-equivariant\nquantization over Rn led us to consider here the problem of equivariant\nquantizations with respect to the Lie superalgebra pgl(p + 1|q) over the superspace Rp|q .\nOver fields of characteristic 0, the projective Lie algebra pgl(n) is isomorphic to the special linear algebra sl(n). This is not always the case if the\ncharacteristic of the ground field is positive or for Lie superalgebras. It turns\nout that our results vary in accordance with the isomorphism of these Lie\nsuperalgebras:\n\u2022 When the projective superalgebra pgl(p + 1|q) is isomorphic to the\nspecial linear Lie superalgebra, our result is similar to the classical\none [22, 11]: we show the existence and uniqueness of the quantization, except for a countable set of critical values of the parameter \u03b4\n(see Proposition 4.1.2 and Theorems 4.2.1 and 4.2.4);\n\u2022 When the projective superalgebra is pgl(n|n) for some n, it is not\nisomorphic to sl(n|n) and our results do not depend on the parameters \u03bb and \u03b4. We prove the existence of a one-parameter family\nof psl(n|n)-equivariant quantizations, that turn out to be pgl(n|n)equivariant (see Theorems 5.2.2 and 5.2.3).\nIn both situations we obtain explicit formulas for the quantization in terms\nof a generalized divergence operator acting on supersymmetric tensor fields.\nThese formulas coincide with the one given by J. George [14] for tensor fields\nof degree two over Rp|q endowed with the flat superconnection.\n2. Notation and problem setting\nIn this section, we will recall the definitions of the spaces of differential\noperators acting on densities and of their corresponding spaces of symbols\nover the superspace Rp|q . Several objects that we use appear here and there\nin the literature, sometimes with different sign conventions. We present\nthem in an explicit way to fix the notation and for the convenience of the\nreader. Then we set the problem of existence of projectively equivariant\nquantizations and symbol maps. Throughout the paper, we only consider\nLie superalgebras over R. We denote by \u00e3 the parity of an homogeneous\n\n\fPROJECTIVELY EQUIVARIANT QUANTIZATIONS\n\n3\n\nobject a. For indices i \u2208 {1, . . . , p + q}, we set \u0129 = 0 if i 6 p and 1 otherwise.\nWe denote by x1 , . . . , xp the set of even indeterminates, and by \u03b8 1 , . . . , \u03b8 q\nthe set of odd (anticommuting) indeterminates. We also use the unified\nnotation y i , where i 6 p + q, for the set of even and odd indeterminates,\ny 1 , . . . , y p being the even x1 , . . . , xp .\n2.1. Densities and weighted symmetric tensors. In the purely even\nsituation, \u03bb-densities (\u03bb \u2208 R) over a manifold M are defined as smooth\nsections of the rank 1 bundle |Vol(M )|\u03bb \u2192 M . This endows the space of\n\u03bb-densities F\u03bb (M ) with a natural action of diffeomorphisms and of vector\nfields. The Vect(M )-modules F\u03bb (M ) can also be seen as deformations of\nthe space of smooth functions. We adopt this second point of view for the\ndefinition of densities over Rp|q and use the classical divergence over Rp|q\nin order to define such a deformation of the Vect(Rp|q )-module of smooth\nfunctions F = C \u221e (Rp|q ).\nDefinition 2.1.1. The divergence of a vector field X \u2208 Vect(Rp|q ) is given\nby\np+q\nX\nfi\n(\u22121)y \u0303i X \u2202yi X i ,\ndiv(X) =\nwhenever X =\n\ni=1\n\nPp+q\n\ni\ni=1 X \u2202y i .\n\nDefinition 2.1.2. The Vect(Rp|q )-module F\u03bb of densities of degree \u03bb is the\nspace of smooth functions F endowed with the Lie derivative given by\nL\u03bbX f = X(f ) + \u03bb div(X)f\nfor all X \u2208 Vect(Rp|q ) and f \u2208 F.\nIt turns out that the Lie derivative of densities is a particular case of Lie\nderivative on generalized tensors considered for instance in [2, 15]. If (V, \u03c1)\nis a representation of the algebra gl(p|q), the space of tensor fields of type\n(V, \u03c1) is defined as T (V ) = F \u2297 V and the Lie derivative of a tensor field\nf \u2297 v along any vector field X is defined by the explicit formula\ne  \u0303X\nf Jij \u2297 \u03c1(eij )v,\n(1)\nLX (f \u2297 v) = X(f ) \u2297 v + (\u22121)X f\nij\n\n \u0303i e\nwhere\n= (\u22121)y X+1 (\u2202yi X j ) and eij is the operator defined in the standard\nbasis e1 , . . . , ep+q of Rp|q (see Definition 3.3.2) by eij (ek ) = \u03b4ki ej . This formula\ndefines a representation of Vect(Rp|q ) on T (V ). For example, identifying the\n\nJij\n\nvector ek \u2208 Rp|q with the constant vector field \u2202yk and taking for \u03c1 the\nidentity representation, we get the Lie derivative (bracket) of vector fields.\nRemark 2.1.3. Formula (1) is not word for word the one given in [2]. Let us\nexplain the correspondence. In that paper, the formula is given by\ne  \u0303X\nf D ij \u2297 \u03c1(Eij )v,\n(2)\nLX (f v) = X(f )v + (\u22121)X f\nij\n\n\fPROJECTIVELY EQUIVARIANT QUANTIZATIONS\n\nwhere\n\n4\n\n \u0303i  \u0303j\n\n \u0303i fj\n\nD ij = (\u22121)y (X +1) \u2202yi X j = \u2212(\u22121)y (y +1) Jij ,\nand Eij is the matrix whose canonical action on ek corresponds to the adjoint\naction of the vector field y i \u2202yj on \u2202yk (identifying ek and \u2202yk as above). We\n \u0303i (y \u0303j +1) i\nej ,\n\nthen have Eij = \u2212(\u22121)y\nsame Lie derivative.\n\nso that Formulas (1) and (2) define the\n\nThe particular case of densities corresponds to a vector space B \u03bb of dimension 1|0 spanned by one element u and the representation of gl(p|q)\ndefined by \u03c1(A)u = \u2212\u03bb str(A)u. Note that in the formulas below, we will\nnot explicitly write down the generator u of B \u03bb unless this leads to confusion.\nAs we continue, we will be interested in the space of symmetric tensor\nfields over Rp|q . Recall that the symmetric algebra over Rp|q is defined as\nthe quotient of the tensor algebra of Rp|q by the graded ideal generated\nby elements of the form v \u2297 w \u2212 (\u22121)\u1e7dw\u0303 w \u2297 v, where v, w \u2208 Rp|q . There\nis a bijection from the symmetric algebra to the subspace of the tensor\nalgebra made of symmetric tensors. It is given, for homogeneous elements\nv1 , . . . , vk \u2208 Rp|q , by\nX\n[v1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 vk ] 7\u2192 v1 \u2228 * * * \u2228 vk =\nsgn(\u03c3, v1 , . . . , vk )v\u03c3\u22121 (1) \u2297 * * * \u2297 v\u03c3\u22121 (k) ,\n\u03c3\u2208Sk\n\nwhere sgn(\u03c3, v1 , . . . , vk ) is the signature of the permutation \u03c3 \u2032 induced by\n\u03c3 on the ordered subset of all odd elements among v1 , . . . , vk . We denote\nby S k the subspace of elements of degree k in the symmetric algebra of the\nsuperspace Rp|q or the corresponding space of supersymmetric tensors.\nThere is also a natural representation \u03c1 of gl(p|q) on S k defined by\n\u03c1(A)(v1 \u2228 * * * \u2228 vl ) =\n\nl\nPj\u22121\nX\n(\u22121)\u00c3( k=1 \u1e7dk ) v1 \u2228 * * * \u2228 Avj \u2228 * * * \u2228 vl .\n\n(3)\n\nj=1\n\nThe space of weighted symmetric tensors S\u03b4k over Rp|q is then the tensor\nproduct B \u03b4 \u2297 S k , where the weight \u03b4 is a real number. It is endowed with\nthe tensor product representation of gl(p|q).\nDefinition 2.1.4. The space of weighted symmetric tensor fields S\u03b4k is\nthe space of tensor fields T (S\u03b4k ) = F \u2297 S\u03b4k endowed with the action L of\nVect(Rp|q ) defined by Formula (1).\n2.2. Differential operators and symbols. We denote by D\u03bb,\u03bc the space\nof linear differential operators from F\u03bb to F\u03bc . The space D\u03bb,\u03bc is filtered by\nk the space of differential\nthe order of differential operators. We denote by D\u03bb,\u03bc\nk\nhas a\noperators of order at most k. It is easy to see that every D \u2208 D\u03bb,\u03bc\nunique expression of the form\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\nX\n\u2202 \u03b1p \u2202 \u03b1p+1\n\u2202 \u03b1p+q\n\u2202 \u03b11\n***\n***\nf, (4)\nD(f ) =\nf\u03b1 (x, \u03b8)\n\u2202x1\n\u2202xp\n\u2202\u03b8 1\n\u2202\u03b8 p\n|\u03b1|6k\n\n\fPROJECTIVELY EQUIVARIANT QUANTIZATIONS\n\n5\n\nP\nwhere \u03b1 is a multiindex, |\u03b1| = p+q\ni=1 \u03b1i , \u03b1p+1 , . . . , \u03b1p+q are in {0, 1} and\nf\u03b1 (x, \u03b8) is in F.\nThe action of Vect(Rp|q ) is induced by its actions on F\u03bb and F\u03bc : it is\ngiven by the supercommutator. For every D \u2208 D\u03bb,\u03bc and X \u2208 Vect(Rp|q ), we\nhave\nLX D = L\u03bcX \u25e6 D \u2212 (\u22121)X\u0303 D\u0303 D \u25e6 L\u03bbX .\nThis action preserves the filtration of differential operators. The space of\nsymbols is the graded space associated with D\u03bb,\u03bc , endowed with the Lie derivative induced by the Lie derivative of differential operators.

The projective superalgebra of vector fields. Let us recall how\nto realize the algebra pgl(p + 1|q) = gl(p + 1|q)/RId as a subalgebra of vector\nfields.

This means that the function gI\nshould be homogeneous of degree \u2212|I|.\n\n\fPROJECTIVELY EQUIVARIANT QUANTIZATIONS\n\n6\n\nAlso recall that it is possible to realize the Lie superalgebra gl(m|n) as a\nsubalgebra of vector fields of Rm|n by the homomorphism of superalgebras\nX\nhm,n : gl(m|n) \u2192 Vect(Rm|n ) : A 7\u2192 \u2212\n(\u22121)j\u0303(\u0129+j\u0303) Aij y j \u2202yi .\ni,j\n\nWe consider the open subset of Rp+1 defined by \u03a9 = {(x0 , . . . , xp ) : x0 > 0}\nand we denote by H(\u03a9) the space of restrictions of functions satisfying (7)\nto \u03a9. There is a correspondence i : F \u2192 H(\u03a9) given by\n\u0013\n\u0012 1\nX\nxp\nx\n0\np\n0 \u2212|I|\n, . . . , 0 \u03b8I ,\ni(f )(x , . . . , x ) =\n(x ) fI\nx0\nx\nI\u2286{1,...,q}\n\nP\n\nif f is given by I\u2286{1,...,q} fI \u03b8 I . Now, the space H(\u03a9) is preserved by the\naction of linear vector fields. Therefore, we can associate with every linear\nvector field X over \u03a9 a vector field \u03c0(X) \u2208 Vect(Rp|q ) by setting\n\u03c0(X)(f ) = i\u22121 \u25e6 X \u25e6 i(f ) for all f in F.\nFor a matrix B = (Bji )i,j=0,...,p+q , the image \u03c0 \u25e6 hp+1,q (B) is given by\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\np+q\np+q\np+q\nX\nX\nX\nBj0 y j (\u22121)j\u0303 E \u2212 B00 E \uf8f8 ,\nB0j \u2202yj \u2212\n(\u22121)j\u0303(\u0129+j\u0303) Bji y j \u2202yi +\n\u2212\uf8ed\ni,j=1\n\nj=1\n\nj=1\n\nwhere E is the Euler vector field defined by\nE=\n\np+q\nX\n\ny i \u2202yi .\n\n(8)\n\ni=1\n\nMoreover, it is easy to check that \u03c0 \u25e6 hp+1,q (Id) = 0, so that the homomorphism \u03c0 \u25e6 hp+1,q induces a homomorphism from pgl(p + 1|q) to Vect(Rp|q ).\nFor a matrix B \u2208 gl(p + 1|q), we denote by [B] its equivalence class in\npgl(p + 1|q). The algebra pgl(p + 1|q) carries a Z-grading defined by\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\na \u03be\nj : pgl(p + 1|q) \u2192 g\u22121 \u2295 g0 \u2295 g1 :\n7\u2192 (h, A \u2212 aId, \u03be),\n(9)\nh A\nwhere g\u22121 = Rp|q , g0 = gl(p|q) and g1 = (Rp|q )\u2217 (the space of row vectors\nwith entries in R).

Projectively equivariant quantizations. A projectively equivariant quantization over Rp|q (in the sense of [9, 22]) is a quantization\nQ : S\u03b4 \u2192 D\u03bb,\u03bc\nsuch that, for every h \u2208 pgl(p + 1|q), one has\nL X h \u25e6 Q = Q \u25e6 LX h .\nThe existence and uniqueness of such quantizations in the purely even case\nwere discussed in [22, 11, 23] for differential operators acting on densities\nand in [3] for differential operators acting on forms.\n3. Construction of the quantization\nHere we will show how the ingredients of the construction of the quantization in the purely even situation generalize and allow us to build the\nquantization in the super situation. A first tool is the so-called affine quantization map.\n3.1. The affine quantization map. Let us build a linear even bijection\nQAff from the space of symbols to the space of differential operators. This\nquantization is defined as the inverse of the total symbol map \u03c3Aff whose\nk is\nrestriction to D\u03bb,\u03bc\nX\n\u03b1p+1\n\u03b1p+q\n\u03b1\nk\n\u03c3Aff : D\u03bb,\u03bc\n\u2192 S\u03b4k : D 7\u2192\nf\u03b1 (x, \u03b8) \u2297 e\u03b11 1 \u2228 * * * \u2228 ep p \u2228 ep+1\n\u2228 * * * \u2228 ep+q\n|\u03b1|6k\n\nwhen D is given by (4). It is easy to see that this map intertwines the actions\nof the affine algebra (made of constant and linear super vector fields) on the\nspace of differential operators and of symbols.\n\n\fPROJECTIVELY EQUIVARIANT QUANTIZATIONS\n\n8\n\nNow, we can use formula (10) in order to express this quantization map\nin a coordinate-free manner:\nProposition 3.1.1. If h1 , . . . , hk \u2208 Rp|q \u223c\n= g\u22121 , t \u2208 F and\nT = t \u2297 h1 \u2228 * * * \u2228 hk ,\none has\nQAff (T ) = (\u22121)k t LX h1 \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 LX hk .\n3.2. The map \u03b3. Using the affine quantization map, we can endow the\nspace of symbols with a structure of representation of Vect(Rp|q ), isomorphic\nto D\u03bb,\u03bc . Explicitly, we set\nLX T = Q\u22121\nAff \u25e6 LX \u25e6 QAff (T )\nfor every T \u2208 S\u03b4 and X \u2208 Vect(Rp|q ).\nThen a projectively equivariant quantization corresponds through the\nmap QAff to a pgl(p + 1|q)\u2212module isomorphism from the representation\n(S\u03b4 , L) to the representation (S\u03b4 , L). Also note that the so-defined representation L on S\u03b4 depends explicitly on the parameter \u03bb associated with\nD\u03bb,\u03bc .\nIn order to measure the difference between these representations, the map\n\u03b3 : g \u2192 gl(S\u03b4 , S\u03b4 ) : h 7\u2192 \u03b3(h) = LX h \u2212 LX h\nwas introduced in [4]. This map can be easily computed in coordinates, and\nit has the same properties as in the classical situation (see [4]):\nProposition 3.2.1. The map \u03b3 vanishes on g\u22121 \u2295 g0 . Moreover, for every\nh \u2208 g1 and k \u2208 N, the restriction of \u03b3(h) to S\u03b4k has values in S\u03b4k\u22121 and is a\ndifferential operator of order zero and parity h\u0303 with constant coefficients.\nRemark 3.2.2. It follows from Proposition 3.2.1 that \u03b3(h) is completely determined by its restriction to constant symbols.\nFor our purpose, it will also be interesting to obtain a coordinate-free\nexpression of \u03b3. To this aim, we first define the interior product of a row\nvector and a symmetric tensor.\nDefinition 3.2.3. The interior product of h \u2208 (Rp|q )\u2217 in a symmetric tensor\nh1 \u2228 * * * \u2228 hk (h1 , . . . , hk \u2208 Rp|q ) is defined by\nk\nPj\u22121  \u0303\nX\n(\u22121)h\u0303( r=1 hr ) hh, hj ih1 \u2228 * * * b\nj * * * \u2228 hk ,\ni(h)h1 \u2228 * * * \u2228 hk =\nj=1\n\nwhere hh, xi denotes the standard matrix multiplication of the row h by the\ncolumn x.\nThis means that we extend the pairing of (Rp|q )\u2217 and Rp|q as a derivation\nof the symmetric product. We may also extend it to S\u03b4 by setting i(h)u = 0\nfor u in B \u03b4 and by defining i(h) as a differential operator of order zero and\nparity h\u0303. This definition allows us to express the operator \u03b3 in simple terms.\n\n\fPROJECTIVELY EQUIVARIANT QUANTIZATIONS\n\n9\n\nProposition 3.2.4. For every h \u2208 g1 \u223c\n= (Rp|q )\u2217 we have on S\u03b4k\n\u03b3(h) = \u2212(\u03bb(p \u2212 q + 1) + k \u2212 1)i(h),\nwhere i(h) is the interior product from Definition 3.2.3.\nProof. Since both sides of the equality are differential operators of order zero\non S\u03b4k , it is sufficient to prove that they yield the same result when applied\nto a tensor h1 \u2228 * * * \u2228 hk (h1 , . . . , hk \u2208 Rp|q ). But by the definition of \u03b3, the\nexpression\nQAff (\u03b3(h)(h1 \u2228 * * * \u2228 hk ))\nis equal to\nLX h \u25e6 QAff (h1 \u2228 * * * \u2228 hk ) \u2212 QAff (LX h (h1 \u2228 * * * \u2228 hk )).\n\n(12)\n\nThis expression is a differential operator of order at most k. Its term of\norder k vanishes: just apply the operator \u03c3k to (12). Hence, we only have\nto sum up the terms of order less than or equal to k \u2212 1 in the first term of\nexpression (12). This latter term writes\n \u0303\n\n \u0303\n\n(\u22121)k [LX h \u25e6 LX h1 \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 LX hk \u2212 (\u22121)h\u0303(h1 +***+hk ) LX h1 \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 LX hk \u25e6 LX h ].\nUsing that the Lie derivative defines a representation of the algebra of vector\nfields, we can successively move LX h to the right in the first term to see that\nthe expression is equal to\n(\u22121)k\n\nk\nPi\u22121  \u0303\nX\n(\u22121)h\u0303( r=1 hr ) LX h1 \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 LX [h,hi ] \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 LX hk .\n| {z }\ni=1\n(i)\n\nMoving LX [h,hi ] back to the left shows that the expression is also equal to\nk\nX\n \u0303 Pi\u22121  \u0303\n(\u22121)k [ (\u22121)hi ( r=1 hr ) LX [h,hi ] \u25e6 LX h1 \u25e6 * * * bi * * * \u25e6 LX hk\ni=1\n\n+\n\ni\u22121\nk X\nX\n\nPi\u22121  \u0303\n \u0303 Pi\u22121\n \u0303\nr=1 hr )+(h\u0303+hi )( r=j+1 hr )\n\n(\u22121)h\u0303(\n\ni=1 j=1\n\nLX h1 \u25e6* * * LX [hj ,[h,hi ]] * * * bi * * *\u25e6LX hk ].\n| {z }\n(j)\n\nIt follows from Equations (1) and (11) that the term of order less than or\nequal to k \u2212 1 in the first summand is exactly\n(\u22121)k\n\nk\nX\n\n \u0303 Pi\u22121 h \u0303r )\nr=1\n\n\u03bb(p \u2212 q + 1)(\u22121)hi (\n\ni=1\n\nhh, hi iLX h1 \u25e6 * * * bi * * * \u25e6 LX hk .\n\nIn order to deal with the second term, we notice that hh, hj i vanishes if h\nand hj do not have the same parity, we compute the bracket\n \u0303  \u0303\n\n \u0303\n\n[hj , [h, hi ]] = hh, hi ihj + (\u22121)hj (hi +h\u0303)+hi h\u0303 hh, hj ihi\n \u0303\n= hh, hi ihj + (\u22121)h\u0303hj hh, hj ihi ,\nand the result follows.\n\n\u0003\n\n\fPROJECTIVELY EQUIVARIANT QUANTIZATIONS\n\n10\n\n3.3. Casimir operators. The construction of the quantizations in the even\ncase can be achieved easily by using Casimir operators. After recalling the\ndefinition of second order Casimir operators for Lie superalgebras [20, p. 57]\n(also see [1, 33, 32, 37, 38] and references therein for detailed descriptions of\nCasimir elements), we specialize to pgl(p + 1|q) \u223c\n= sl(p + 1|q) (thus assuming\nq 6= p + 1). We consider the Casimir operators C and C associated with the\nrepresentations L and L on S\u03b4 . We show that the Casimir operator C is\ndiagonalizable and that there is a simple relation between these operators.\nAs in the purely even case, the analysis of the eigenvector problem for these\noperators allows us to build the quantization.\nDefinition 3.3.1. Consider a Lie superalgebra l endowed with an even nondegenerate supersymmetric bilinear form F and a representation (V, \u03b2) of l.\nChoosing a homogeneous basis (ui : i 6 n) of l and denoting by (u\u2032i : i 6 n)\nthe F -dual basis (F (ui , u\u2032j ) = \u03b4i,j ), the Casimir operator of (V, \u03b2) is defined\nby\nn\nn\nX\nX\n\u2032\nu \u0303i\n\u03b2(u\u2032i )\u03b2(ui ).\n(\u22121) \u03b2(ui )\u03b2(ui ) =\nC=\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nRecall that the Killing form K\u03c6 associated with a representation (V, \u03c6) of\na Lie superalgebra l is defined by\nK\u03c6 (A, B) = str(\u03c6(A)\u03c6(B))\n\nfor all A, B in l. Unless otherwise stated, we will only consider the Killing\nform associated with the adjoint representation of the superalgebra, which\nwe will denote by K and call the Killing form of the superalgebra. Then the\nKilling form of sl(p + 1|q) is given by\nK(A, B) = str(ad(A)ad(B)) = 2(p + 1 \u2212 q) str(AB)\n\n(13)\n\nfor all A and B in sl(p + 1|q). Under our assumption q 6= p + 1, it is a\nnon-degenerate even supersymmetric bilinear form on this algebra.\nThe Casimir operator does not depend on the choice of a particular basis.\nWe thus choose a basis that is homogeneous with respect to the Z-grading\nof the algebra.\nDefinition 3.3.2. For r 6 p + q, we denote by er (resp. \u03b5r ) the column\n(resp. row) vector in Rp|q (resp. (Rp|q )\u2217 ) whose entries are 0, except the\n(\u22121)r\u0303\n\u03b5r .\nr-th one which is 1. We also set \u01ebr = 2(p\u2212q+1)\nThe following proposition is a direct transposition in the super setting of\n[4, Proposition 1]. It can be checked directly.\nProposition 3.3.3. For every basis (gs , s 6 dim g0 ) of g0 , the set (er , gs , \u01ebt )\nis a basis of sl(p+1|q) whose Killing-dual basis writes (\u01ebr , gs\u2032 , (\u22121)t\u0303 et ), where\n(gs\u2032 , s 6 dim g0 ) is a basis of g0 .

Then the Killing-dual basis\nE\n, (\u22121)t\u0303 et ), where (h\u2032s ) is a basis of h0 .\nof (er , hs , E, \u01ebt ) is (\u01ebr , h\u2032s , 2(p\u2212q)\nUsing this particular choice of a basis, we obtain directly a decomposition\nof the Casimir operator of any representation of sl(p + 1|q) that is consistent\nwith the additionnal Z-grading of this algebra (see Formula (9)).\nLemma 3.3.4.

The Casimir operators are related by\nC = C + N.\n\n(17)\n\nNow, we want to compute the Casimir operator C on S\u03b4k . We need to\nintroduce some notation from the classical representation theory of gl(p|q)\nor sl(p|q). For the most part, we follow the notation of [18]. We denote\nby D (resp. H) the subalgebra of gl(p|q) (resp. sl(p|q)) made of diagonal\nmatrices. We denote by (\u03b7i : i 6 p + q) the standard basis of D \u2217 , i.e. if\n\u2206 = diag(\u22061 , . . . , \u2206p+q ) we set\n\u03b7i (\u2206) = \u2206i .\nWe use the same notation for the restrictions of \u03b7i to H. When p 6= q, the\nrestriction of the Killing form of sl(p|q) to H is non-degenerate. It induces a\nnon-degenerate bilinear form on H \u2217 . It can be computed that this bilinear\nform is given by\n1\n(\u22121)\u0129\n\u03b4ij \u2212\n,\n(\u03b7i , \u03b7j ) =\n2(p \u2212 q)\n2(p \u2212 q)2\nfor all 1 6 i, j 6 p + q. We also consider the Borel subalgebra made of\nupper triangular matrices. The choice of this subalgebra allows us to define\n\n\fPROJECTIVELY EQUIVARIANT QUANTIZATIONS\n\n12\n\npositive roots. There are also even and odd roots, corresponding to root\nspaces in the even or odd subspaces of sl(p|q). We denote by \u03c1S the element\nof H \u2217 defined by \u03c1S = \u03c10 \u2212 \u03c11 , where \u03c10 (resp. \u03c11 ) is half the sum of the\npositive even (resp. odd) roots. In this situation, we can show that \u03c1S is\ngiven by\n!\nq\np\nX\n1 X\n(18)\n(p + q + 1 \u2212 2r)\u03b7p+r .\n(p \u2212 q + 1 \u2212 2r)\u03b7r +\n\u03c1S =\n2 r=1\nr=1\nThese data allow us to compute the Casimir operator C.\n\nProposition 3.3.7. The Casimir operator defined by the action of the projective superalgebra pgl(p + 1|q) \u223c\n= sl(p + 1|q) on S\u03b4k is a multiple of the\nidentity. The associated eigenvalue is given by\n\u03b1(k, \u03b4) =\n\np \u2212 q 2 2k + p \u2212 q\nk(k + (p \u2212 q))\n\u03b4 \u2212\n\u03b4+\n.\n2\n2\n(p \u2212 q + 1)\n\nProof. The proof goes as in the purely even case (see [4, 27] for instance).\nLet us recall the main developments and assume first that p and q are distinct. The Casimir operator C commutes with the action of constant vector\nfields on S\u03b4k . A direct computation shows that it has therefore constant coefficients. Hence, in (16), we just collect the terms with constant coefficients.\nThe first summand does not contain such terms if \u03b2 = LX . In \u03b2(E), terms\nwith constant coefficients are (\u03b4(p \u2212 q)\u2212 k) times the identity. Finally, in the\nP\n \u0303\nlast summand, they are equal to s (\u22121)hs \u03c1(hs )\u03c1(h\u2032s ), where \u03c1 is the action\nof sl(p|q) on symmetric tensors defined by (3). This operator is actually\np\u2212q\nk\np\u2212q+1 C0 , where C0 is the Casimir operator of the representation (S , \u03c1) of\nsl(p|q). Indeed, the bases (hs ) and (h\u2032s ) are dual with respect to the Killing\nform of sl(p + 1|q) and the restriction of this Killing form to the subalgebra\nsl(p|q) is equal to (p \u2212 q + 1)/(p \u2212 q) times the Killing form of the subalgebra.\nSince the space S k is an irreducible representation with highest weight k\u03b71 ,\nits Casimir operator is a multiple of the identity with eigenvalue\n(k\u03b71 , k\u03b71 + 2\u03c1S ) =\n\nk(p \u2212 q \u2212 1)\n(k + (p \u2212 q)),\n2(p \u2212 q)2\n\n(19)\n\nand the result follows in this case.\nIn the particular case p = q, we use the same developments, but we use\n(15) instead of (16) to obtain\nX\n1\nC = \u03c1(Id) +\n(\u22121)g \u0303s \u03c1(gs )\u03c1(gs\u2032 ).\n(20)\n2\ns\nThe first summand is clearly equal to k2 Id, while the second is the Casimir\noperator of gl(p|p) associated with the invariant bilinear form K0 induced\non g0 = gl(p|p) by the Killing form of sl(p + 1|p). This form is given by\nK0 : gl(p|p) \u00d7 gl(p|p) \u2192 R : (A, B) 7\u2192 2(str(AB) \u2212 str(A)str(B)).\n\n\fPROJECTIVELY EQUIVARIANT QUANTIZATIONS\n\n13\n\nThis Casimir operator can be computed in a standard way: we notice that\nthe space of weighted symmetric tensors S\u03b4k over Rp|p is a representation of\ngl(p|p) with highest weight\n!\np\nX\n(\u03b7r \u2212 \u03b7r+p ) .\n\u039b = k\u03b71 \u2212 \u03b4str = k\u03b71 \u2212 \u03b4\nr=1\n\nThe restriction of K0 to the Cartan subalgebra D of diagonal matrices is\nnon-degenerate and allows one to define a bilinear form (*, *) on D \u2217 . It is\nthen easy to compute the relations\n(\u039b, \u039b) = k(k \u2212 \u03b4)\n\nk\nand (\u039b, 2\u03c1S ) = \u2212 ,\n2\n\nwhere \u03c1S is given by (18) (with q = p). Therefore, the last summand in (20)\n\u0003\nreads (k(k \u2212 \u03b4) \u2212 k2 )Id and the result follows.\n4. The explicit construction\n4.1. Critical values. Let us start this section with the definition of critical\nvalues of the parameter \u03b4.\nDefinition 4.1.1. A value of \u03b4 is critical if there exist k, l \u2208 N with l < k\nsuch that \u03b1(k, \u03b4) = \u03b1(l, \u03b4).\nUsing Proposition 3.3.7, we can easily describe the set of critical values.\nProposition 4.1.2. The set of critical values for the sl(p + 1|q)-equivariant\nquantization over Rp|q is given by\n\u001a\n\u001b\n2k \u2212 l + p \u2212 q\n\u221e\nC = \u222ak=1 Ck , where Ck =\n: l = 1, . . . , k .\np\u2212q+1\nRemark 4.1.3. The critical values here correspond to the ones in the classical\nsituation (see [11, p. 63]) up to replacement of the dimension n by the\nsuperdimension p \u2212 q. However, since the superdimension can be negative,\nthere exist some values of (p|q) such that \u03b4 = 0 is a critical value.\n4.2. The construction. We can now state the main results.\nTheorem 4.2.1. If \u03b4 is not critical, then there exists a unique projectively\nequivariant quantization from S\u03b4 to D\u03bb,\u03bc .\nProof. The proof is as in [4] and [9]. We give here the main ideas for the\nsake of completeness.\nFirst, remark that for every S \u2208 S\u03b4k , there exists a unique eigenvector \u015c\nof C with eigenvalue \u03b1(k, \u03b4) such that\n\u001a\n\u015c = Sk + Sk\u22121 + * * * + S0 , Sk = S\nSl \u2208 S\u03b4l for all l 6 k \u2212 1.\n\n\fPROJECTIVELY EQUIVARIANT QUANTIZATIONS\n\n14\n\nIndeed, these conditions write\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 C(S) = \u03b1(k, \u03b4)S\n(C \u2212 \u03b1(k, \u03b4)Id)Sk\u2212l = \u2212N (Sk\u2212l+1 ) for all l \u2208 {1, . . . , k}\n\uf8f3\nSk\u2212l \u2208 S\u03b4k\u2212l .\n\n(21)\n\nThis system of equations has a unique solution. Indeed, as \u03b4 is not critical,\nthe differences \u03b1(k, \u03b4) \u2212 \u03b1(l, \u03b4) are different from 0.\nNow, define the quantization Q (remark that this is the only way to\nproceed) by\nQ|S k (S) = \u015c.\n\u03b4\n\nIt is clearly a bijection and it also fulfills\nQ \u25e6 LX h = L X h \u25e6 Q\n\nfor all h \u2208 sl(p + 1|q).\n\nIndeed, for all S \u2208 S\u03b4k , the tensors Q(LX h S) and LX h (Q(S)) share the\nfollowing properties:\n\u2022 they are eigenvectors of C of eigenvalue \u03b1(k, \u03b4) because, on the one\nhand, C commutes with LX h for all h and, on the other hand, C\ncommutes with LX h for all h.\n\u2022 their term of degree k is exactly LX h S.\nThe first part of the proof shows that they have to coincide.\n\u0003\nLet us now introduce a new operator on symmetric tensor fields.\nDefinition 4.2.2. Using the bases of Definition 3.3.2 we define the divergence operator on symbols by :\ndiv : S\u03b4k \u2192 S\u03b4k\u22121 : S 7\u2192\n\np+q\nX\n\n \u0303j\n\n(\u22121)y i(\u03b5j )\u2202yj S.\n\n(22)\n\nj=1\n\nRemark 4.2.3. It is easy to check that the restriction of this divergence\noperator to vector fields, that is, to S01 , coincides with the divergence of\nDefinition 2.1.1. It is also easy to check that this divergence operator is not\ninvariant with respect to divergence-free vector fields unless k 6 1.\nWe can now give the explicit formula for the sl(p + 1|q)-equivariant quantization.\nTheorem 4.2.4. If \u03b4 is not critical, then the map Q : S\u03b4 \u2192 D\u03bb,\u03bc defined by\nQ(S)(f ) =\n\nk\nX\n\nCk,r QAff (divr S)(f )\n\nfor all S \u2208 S\u03b4k\n\n(23)\n\nr=0\n\nis the unique sl(p + 1|q)-equivariant quantization over Rp|q if\nQr\nj=1 ((p \u2212 q + 1)\u03bb + k \u2212 j)\nfor all r > 1,\nCk,r = Qr\nr! j=1 (p \u2212 q + 2k \u2212 j \u2212 (p \u2212 q + 1)\u03b4)\n\nCk,0 = 1.\n\n\fPROJECTIVELY EQUIVARIANT QUANTIZATIONS\n\n15\n\nProof. Using the definition of N , Equation (21) is equivalent to\nP\ni\ne\n2 p+q\ni=1 \u03b3(\u01eb )LX i Sr+1\nSr =\n, 0 6 r 6 k \u2212 1.\n\u03b1(k, \u03b4) \u2212 \u03b1(r, \u03b4)\nWe conclude using Definition 3.3.2 and Proposition 3.2.4.\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 4.2.5.\na) Formula (23) coincides with Formula (2.4) given in [11], if we replace\nthe dimension n by the superdimension p \u2212 q and the divergence operator D by the divergence operator div defined above. In particular,\nFormula (23) can be written under the same form as Equation (3.2)\nin [11], using hypergeometric functions.\nb) It was already pointed out in [23] and [11] that for critical values of\n\u03b4 the quantization does not exist for generic values of \u03bb, but there\nare some specific values of this parameter such that the equivariant\nquantization exists.\n\n5. psl(p + 1|p + 1)- and pgl(p + 1|p + 1)-equivariant quantizations\n5.1. The setting. In the developments above, we analyzed the pgl(p + 1|q)equivariant quantizations on Rp|q when q 6= p+1. In this section, we analyze\nthe remaining special case that presents phenomena that have no analogues\nin the classical theory of projectively equivariant quantization.\nIndeed, the projective superalgebra pgl(p + 1|p + 1) is not isomorphic\nto sl(p + 1|p + 1). The formula div(f X) = f divX + X(f ) that holds for\nevery function f and every even vector field X, shows that the quadratic\nvector fields of this superalgebra are divergence-free. It is not endowed with\na non-degenerate bilinear symmetric invariant form and moreover it is not\nsimple, because it has a codimension one ideal psl(p + 1|p + 1). We now\nanalyze the existence of the psl(p + 1|p + 1)-equivariant quantization. Since\nthis algebra is made of divergence-free fields, the modules of densities are all\nisomorphic to the space of functions and the existence of the quantization\ndoes not depend on the parameters \u03bb and \u03b4. We show that the method\nabove can be applied to the ideal psl(p + 1|p + 1) to define a one-parameter\nfamily of psl(p+1|p+1)-equivariant quantizations over Rp|p+1 and that these\nquantizations are in fact pgl(p + 1|p + 1)-equivariant.\nIt was remarked by I. Kaplansky [21] that, even though the Killing form\nof psl(p + 1|p + 1) vanishes, this algebra is endowed with a non-degenerate\ninvariant supersymmetric even form, namely\nK([A], [B]) = str(AB).\nThe isomorphism j (see (9)) identifies the subalgebra psl(p + 1|p + 1) to\ng\u22121 \u2295 g0 \u2295 g1 , where g\u22121 = Rp|p+1 , g0 = sl(p|p + 1) and g1 = (Rp|p+1 )\u2217 .\n\n\fPROJECTIVELY EQUIVARIANT QUANTIZATIONS\n\n16\n\n5.2. Construction of the quantization. We now modify the arguments\nof Section 3 to get the existence of the quantization.\nTheorem 5.2.1. The Casimir operator C of psl(p + 1|p + 1) acting on S\u03b4k\nis equal to 2k(k \u2212 1) times the identity.\nProof. We choose a suitable basis as above by considering (ei , gs , (\u22121)\u0129 \u03b5i ),\nwhere ei and \u03b5i are as in Definition 3.3.2 and the elements gs form a basis in sl(p|p + 1). It is then easy to see that the K-dual basis is of the\nform ((\u22121)\u0129 \u03b5i , gs\u2032 , (\u22121)\u0129 ei ), where gs\u2032 is some basis in sl(p|p + 1). An easy\ncomputation shows that, in psl(p + 1|p + 1), we have\nX\n[ei , \u03b5i ] = 0.\ni\n\nTherefore, we can then adapt Lemma 3.3.4: for any representation (V, \u03b2) of\npsl(p + 1|p + 1), the Casimir operator of (V, \u03b2) is given by\n2\n\n2p+1\nX\n\n\u03b2((\u22121)r\u0303 \u03b5r )\u03b2(er ) +\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)g \u0303s \u03b2(gs )\u03b2(gs\u2032 ).\n\n(24)\n\ns\n\nr=1\n\nWhen \u03b2 = LX , we collect again the terms with constant coefficients. The\nfirst summand does not contain such terms and in the second summand,\nthey are equal to\nX\n(25)\n(\u22121)g \u0303s \u03c1(gs )\u03c1(gs\u2032 ),\ns\n\nwhere \u03c1 denotes the action of sl(p|p + 1) on supersymmetric tensors (see\nFormula (3)). We remark that the Killing form of sl(p|p + 1) is equal to \u22122\ntimes the restriction of the form K to sl(p|p + 1), so that (25) is equal to\n\u22122 times the Casimir operator of sl(p|p + 1). The result follows using (19),\nwith q = p + 1.\n\u0003\nWe deduce from the previous result that the situation is critical for the\npsl(p+1|p+1)-equivariant quantization, since the eigenvalues of the Casimir\noperator on S\u03b41 and on S\u03b40 coincide. However, it is possible to build the\nquantization because \u03b3(h) vanishes on S\u03b41 for every h \u2208 g1 (see Remark\n4.2.5).\nTheorem 5.2.2. The map Q : S\u03b4 \u2192 D\u03bb,\u03bc given on S\u03b4k for k 6= 1 by Theorem\n4.2.4 and by\nQ1 : S\u03b41 \u2192 D\u03bb,\u03bc : S 7\u2192 Q(S)(f ) = QAff (S)f + t div(S)f\n\ndefines a psl(p+1|p+1)-equivariant quantization over Rp|p+1 for every t \u2208 R.\nProof. For the quantization of symbols of degree not equal to 1, we just\nfollow the lines of Theorems 4.2.1 and 4.2.4. For symbols of degree 1, since\n\u03b3(h) vanishes on S\u03b41 , QAff defines a psl(p + 1|p + 1)-equivariant quantization\nof symbols of degree 1 (recall that \u03b3 precisely measures the failure of equivariance of QAff ). The proposed map Q1 defines a quantization for every t,\n\n\fPROJECTIVELY EQUIVARIANT QUANTIZATIONS\n\n17\n\nsince the psl(p + 1|p + 1)-modules S\u03b41 and S01 are equivalent and we have\ntherefore, using the basic properties of the divergence,\nLX divS = divLX S\nfor every S \u2208 S\u03b41 and every divergence-free vector field X.\n\n\u0003\n\nWe now have a result about the pgl(p + 1|p + 1)-equivariant quantization.\nTheorem 5.2.3. The psl(p + 1|p + 1)-equivariant quantizations defined in\nTheorem 5.2.2 are equivariant with respect to pgl(p + 1|p + 1).\nProof. Since the algebra of vector fields pgl(p + 1|p + 1) is generated by\nP2p+1 i\npsl(p + 1|p + 1) and the Euler field E = i=1\ny \u2202yi , it is sufficient to show\nthat the quantization is equivariant with respect to this linear vector field.\nThis reduces to show that we have\nLE divS = divLE S\nfor every S \u2208\n\nS\u03b4k .\n\nThis can be checked directly.\n\n\u0003\n\n6.
