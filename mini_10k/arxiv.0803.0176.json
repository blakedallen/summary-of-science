This formulation is suitable for studying the high-energy dynamics of YangMills theory. For instance, it is well known that the perturbation theory in the\ncoupling constant developed in terms of the Yang-Mills field is very powerful in the\nultraviolet region due to its asymptotic freedom. In the low-energy region, however,\nwe encounter the strong coupling problem, and its description in terms of the YangMills gauge field is no longer valid. In studying the low-energy dynamics of Yang-Mills\ntheory and quantum chromodynamics (QCD), it is important to specify the most\nrelevant degrees of freedom for the phenomenon in question. Quark confinement as\na typical phenomenon in the low-energy dynamics caused by strong interactions is\nbelieved to be explained by topological defects including magnetic monopoles, vortices\nand merons. This motivates us to devise another formulation of Yang-Mills theory in\nterms of new variables reflecting the topological degrees of freedom.\nFor quark confinement, magnetic monopoles and center vortices are believed\nto be the dominant topological degrees of freedom. However, Abelian magnetic\nmonopoles [2] or center vortices in SU(N) Yang-Mills theory have been obtained as\ngauge\u2013fixing defects by partial gauge fixings called the maximal Abelian gauge [2, 3]\nSU(N) \u2192 U(1)N \u22121 or the maximal center gauge [4] SU(N) \u2192 Z(N), where U(1)N \u22121\nis the maximal torus (Cartan) subgroup and Z(N) is the center subgroup of SU(N).\nTherefore, the current method of constructing Abelian magnetic monopoles and center vortices cannot avoid charge of the gauge artifact.\nIn view of this, we take up the Cho-Faddeev-Niemi-Shabanov (CFNS) decomposition of the Yang-Mills field, which was first proposed in 1981 by Cho [5] and has been\nrecently readdressed by Faddeev and Niemi [6] and Shabanov [7]. This machinery\nenables one to explain and understand some of the low-energy phenomena by separating the contributions due to topological defects in a gauge-invariant manner. This\nfeature should be compared with other methods.\nBy developing the approach founded in CFNS [5\u20137], we have succeeded in giving a\ngauge-invariant description of the dual superconductivity in SU(2) Yang-Mills theory\nin a continuum [8\u201310] and on a lattice [11\u201313]. In particular, the Wilson loop operator\n[14] is expressed exactly in terms of the gauge-invariant magnetic current [15], and the\nmagnetic monopole can be defined in a gauge-invariant manner, which follows from a\nnon-Abelian Stokes theorem for the Wilson loop operator, see [15\u201317] and references\ntherein. These results enable us to determine the role of a magnetic monopole in\nconfinement.\nFor the SU(2) gauge group, the CFNS decomposition of the Yang-Mills field and\nthe reformulation of Yang-Mills theory in terms of the resulting new variables are\nessentially unique. Therefore, we have nothing new to be added for SU(2) gauge\ngroup. It is important to note that a unit vector field n(x) called the color field\nhereafter plays the key role.\nFor the SU(N) gauge group, the conventional approaches [18\u201321] introduce r unit\nvector fields nj (x) from the beginning, where r = N \u2212 1 is the rank of the SU(N)\ngroup. These r color fields are used to define r gauge-invariant magnetic monopoles.\nThis feature should be compared with the Abelian projection in which r Abelian\nmagnetic monopoles corresponding to every U(1) of the maximal torus subgroup\nU(1)r are generated due to the partial gauge fixing SU(N) \u2192 U(1)r . In this paper\n1\n\n\fwe point out that such an approach is sufficient, but not necessary for reformulating\nYang-Mills theory and that there are other options. In fact, we explicitly construct\nan option called the minimal case. In connection to the minimal case, we call the\nconventional option [option corresponding to the conventional case] the maximal case.\nEven in the maximal case, we show that there are new options that yield the same\nconclusion.\nThe conventional approach suggests that r magnetic monopoles can be the dominant topological degrees of freedom for confinement. However, this is not the inevitable conclusion. As conjectured in [17], it is shown [15] using a non-Abelian\nStokes theorem that the SU(N) Wilson loop operator can be rewritten in terms\nof the gauge-invariant magnetic current corresponding to a single non-Abelian magnetic monopole [22] irrespective of N. Therefore, the Wilson loop operator does\nnot require r gauge-dependent Abelian and gauge-invariant Abelian-like magnetic\nmonopoles. Rather, the Wilson loop operator can probe only a single non-Abelian\nmagnetic monopole. From this viewpoint, the minimal option is the most economical\nway of reformulating Yang-Mills theory, where a single unit color field h is introduced\nand the gauge-invariant magnetic monopole constructed in this option agrees exactly\nwith the magnetic monopole derived from the Wilson loop operator through a nonAbelian Stokes theorem. The lattice versions of new reformulations for the SU(N)\ngauge group given in this paper are constructed in [23, 24], which enable us to perform a numerical simulation on the lattice to study the nonperturbative phenomena\nin question.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we discuss how to construct\nthe color field for SU(N) gauge group. In this construction we introduce the maximal and minimal options for SU(N), N \u2265 3. The distinction originates from the\ndegeneracy associated with the diagonalization of the scalar field introduced for determining the color field, which undergoes an adjoint transformation under the gauge\ntransformation. We examine how many degrees of freedom the color field carries\nfrom the viewpoint of the change of variables. Moreover, we point out that there\nare intermediate options other than the maximal and minimal options for SU(N),\nN \u2265 4.\nIn section 3, we show how such a color field defined in section 2 is realized as\na functional of the original Yang-Mills field for the maximal and minimal options.\nWe obtain the defining equations, which enable us to specify the new variables as\nfunctionals of the original Yang-Mills field. This is important for identifying the color\nfield as one of the new variables obtained by the change of variables from the original\nYang-Mills field. We give a prescription called the reduction condition for obtaining\nthe color field as a functional of the original Yang-Mills field.\nIn section 4, we discuss the physically interesting SU(3) case to explicitly demonstrate the general procedure given in the previous section.\nIn section 5, we consider a quantum version of the reformulated Yang-Mills theory\nbased on a functional integral method. The key issue is to obtain the Jacobian\nassociated with the change of variables from the original Yang-Mills field to the new\nvariables.\nThe final section is devoted to a conclusion and discussion. Some of the technical\ncontent is summarized in the Appendices.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nConstruction of the color vector field\n\nIn the conventional approach, the magnetic monopole in Yang-Mills theory is extracted using the Abelian projection [2]. The Abelian projection selects a special direction in color space. Consequently, partial gauge fixing, e.g., the maximal Abelian\n(MA) gauge [2, 3] used so far for realizing the Abelian projection, breaks the color\nsymmetry explicitly. In our reformulation of Yang-Mills theory, the color field n(x)\nplays the role of recovering the color symmetry that is lost in the conventional treatment of the Abelian projection, in which the maximal torus subgroup is selected from\nthe original gauge group G.\nFirst of all, we consider how to define the color field n(x) in SU(N) Yang-Mills\ngauge theory. The color field n(x) is used to specify only the color direction in the\ncolor space at each space-time point x \u2208 RD in D-dimensional space-time, and its\nmagnitude is irrelevant for our purposes. Therefore, the color field n(x) is introduced\nas a unit field; its length is equal to one, i.e., n(x) * n(x) = 1.\nTo express the color vector, we use two different notations in this paper:\nthe vector form:\nn(x) = (nA (x))dA=1 = (n1 (x), n2 (x), * * * , nd (x)),\n\nd \u2261 dimSU(N) = N 2 \u2212 1, (2.1)\n\nwhere d is the dimension of the gauge group G = SU(N).\nLie algebra form:\nn(x) = nA (x)TA (A = 1, 2, * * * , d),\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere TA are the generators of the Lie algebra G = su(N) of the Lie group G =\nSU(N). The two notations are equivalent, since the color field is constructed in such\na way that it transforms according to the adjoint representation under the action of\nthe gauge group. Hereafter, we use these notations for other fields that transform\naccording to the adjoint representation under the action of the gauge group, e.g.,\n~\n\u03c6(x)\n=(\u03c6A (x))dA=1 = (\u03c61 (x), \u03c62 (x), * * * , \u03c6d (x)),\n\n\u03c6(x) =\u03c6A (x)TA (A = 1, 2, * * * , d).\n\n(2.3)\n(2.4)\n\nIt should be understood that TA denotes the generator in the fundamental representation, unless otherwise stated.\nThe product of two Lie algebra valued functions, X = X A T A and Y = Y A T A ,\nis rewritten as the sum of three types of products, which is written in the vector form\nas\n1\n1\n1\nX Y = X AY B T AT B =\n(X * Y)1 + iX \u00d7 Y + X \u2217 Y,\n(2.5)\n2N\n2\n2\nwhere the three types of products are defined by\nX * Y :=X A Y A ,\n\n(2.6a)\n\nX \u00d7 Y :=f ABC X B Y C ,\nX \u2217 Y :=d\n\nABC\n\nB\n\nC\n\nX Y .\n\n(2.6b)\n(2.6c)\n\nHere the structure constants f ABC of the Lie algebra su(N) are defined by\nf ABC = \u22122iTr([T A , T B ]T C ),\n\n(A, B, C \u2208 {1, 2, . . .

For SU(2), a\nHermitian matrix\n\u03c6(x) = \u03c6A (x)TA ,\n\n1\nTA = \u03c3A , (A = 1, 2, 3)\n2\n\n(2.12)\n\nwith 2 by 2 Pauli matrices \u03c3A can be cast into the diagonal form using a suitable\nunitary matrix U \u2208 SU(2)(\u2282 U(2)) as\nU(x)\u03c6(x)U \u2020 (x) = diag(\u039b1 (x), \u039b2 (x)) := \u039b(x).\n\n(2.13)\n\nThe eigenvalues \u039b1 and \u039b2 must be real due to the Hermiticity of \u03c6, i.e., \u03c6\u2020 = \u03c6.\nThe traceless condition tr(\u03c6) = tr(\u039b) = \u039b1 + \u039b2 = 0 yields \u039b1 = \u2212\u039b2 . Hence, \u03c6(x)\nis written as\n\u03c6(x) = U \u2020 (x)diag(\u039b1 (x), \u2212\u039b1 (x))U(x) = \u039b1 (x)U \u2020 (x)\u03c33 U(x).\n\n(2.14)\n\nFor the explicit representation of the matrix\n!\n\n1\n\u03c63 (x)\n\u03c61 (x) \u2212 i\u03c62 (x)\n,\n\u03c6(x) = \u03c6A (x)TA =\n\u2212\u03c63 (x)\n2 \u03c61 (x) + i\u03c62 (x)\n\n(2.15)\n\nits eigenvalues are easily obtained as\n1q\n1 ~\n1 q~\n~\n\u03c6(x) * \u03c6(x)\n:= \u00b1 |\u03c6(x)|,\n\u03c61 (x)2 + \u03c62 (x)2 + \u03c63 (x)2 = \u00b1\n2\n2\n2\n(2.16)\nsince det(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03bb1) = \u03bb2 \u2212 41 (\u03c621 + \u03c622 + \u03c623 ).\nImposing the condition of unit length |\u03c6(x)| = 1, we obtain \u039b1 (x) = \u00b11/2, and\ntherefore a unit color field n(x) is obtained in the form\n\u039b1 (x), \u039b2 (x) = \u00b1\n\nn(x) = \u00b1U \u2020 (x)T3 U(x).\n4\n\n(2.17)\n\n\fThe unit color field n(x) is also expressed as\nn(x) = \u03c6(x)/|\u03c6(x)|,\n\n|\u03c6(x)| :=\n\nq\n\n2tr(\u03c6(x)2 ) =\n\nq\n\n~\n~\n\u03c6(x)\n* \u03c6(x).\n\n(2.18)\n\nNote that \u03c6(x) is invariant under the U(1) local transformation in the sense that for\nU\u03b8 (x) = eiT3 \u03b8 U(x),\nU\u03b8 (x)\u03c6(x)U\u03b8\u2020 (x) = \u039b1 (x)eiT3 \u03b8 \u03c33 e\u2212iT3 \u03b8 = \u039b1 (x)\u03c33 .\n\n(2.19)\n\nHere we consider the Weyl group as a discrete subgroup of SU(2), i.e., the permutation\ngroup P2 with 2 elements corresponding to the permutations of the 2 bases in the\nfundamental representation. An element of the Weyl group is expressed as a constant\n(or uniform) off-diagonal matrix, e.g.,\n\u03c32\n\u03c31\ncos \u03c6 +\nsin \u03c6\nW = exp i\u03c0\n2\n2\n=i (\u03c31 cos \u03c6 + \u03c32 sin \u03c6)\n\u0014\n\n=i\n\n0\ne+i\u03c6\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\n!\n\ne\u2212i\u03c6\n\u2208 P2 \u2282 SU(2).\n0\n\n(2.20)\n\nTherefore, \u03c6(x) changes its sign under the Weyl transformation: For UW (x) =\nW U(x), we have\n\u2020\n(x) = \u039b1 (x)W \u03c33 W \u2020 = \u2212\u039b1 (x)\u03c33 .\nUW (x)\u03c6(x)UW\n\n(2.21)\n\nChanging the sign of \u039b(x) globally corresponds to changing the order of the diagonal\ncomponents \u039bk (x) globally. We can fix the discrete global symmetry for the Weyl\ngroup by imposing an additional condition such as \u039b(x) \u2265 0 or the ordering condition\n\u039b1 (x) \u2265 \u039b2 (x).\nNow we consider the situation in which the two eigenvalues become degenerate\nat a certain space-time point x0 \u2208 RD , i.e., \u039b1 (x0 ) = \u039b2 (x0 ). This is realized only\nwhen \u039b1 (x0 ) = \u039b2 (x0 ) = 0. Therefore, the three conditions \u03c61 (x0 ) = \u03c62 (x0 ) =\n\u03c63 (x0 ) = 0 must be satisfied simultaneously at the degenerate point x0 . Hence, a\nset of degenerate points forms a 0-dimensional (pointlike) manifold in R3 or a onedimensional (linelike) manifold in R4 . Note that the conditions, \u03c61 (x0 ) = \u03c62 (x0 ) =\n\u03c63 (x0 ) = 0, are SU(2) rotation-invariant. The rotation-invariant condition \u03c6(x) = 0\nfor \u03c6(x) can be regarded as the singularity condition for the unit vector field n(x) =\n\u03c6(x)/|\u03c6(x)|. Therefore, the degenerate point of \u03c6(x) appears as the singular point of\nn(x). In fact, it is known that a magnetic monopole in Yang-Mills theory can appear\nas the hedgehog configuration at such a singular point, see, for example, [15].\nFor G = SU(2), the color field is given by the three-dimensional unit vector\nn(x) = (n1 (x), n2 (x), n3 (x)).\n\n(2.22)\n\nThe unit vector n(x) = (n1 (x), n2 (x), n3 (x)) specifies a two-sphere S 2 at x, which is\nisomorphic to SU(2)/U(1), since n1 (x)2 + n2 (x)2 + n3 (x)2 = 1. The maximal torus\ngroup of SU(2) is U(1) and the U(1) local rotation corresponds to the local rotation\naround the direction of the color field n(x), which does not change (the direction of)\nthe color vector n(x) at x. Here, by the local rotation, we mean that the angle of\n5\n\n\frotation is arbitrary at each spacetime point. This enables us to decompose the group\nSU(2)local as\nSU(2)local = [SU(2)/U(1)]local \u00d7 U(1)local .\n(2.23)\n\nWith shown in the above, the color field in the SU(2) case can be constructed using\nthe so-called adjoint orbit representation:\nn(x) = U \u2020 (x)T3 U(x),\n\nU(x) \u2208 SU(2).\n\n(2.24)\n\nIt is easy to check for example using the Euler-angle representation of the group\nelement U(x) that the diagonal U(1) part of the group element U(x) does not affect\nthe right-hand side of the adjoint orbit representation. Therefore, n(x) defined in\nthis way indeed reflects the [SU(2)/U(1)]local symmetry. The composition of U(x) \u2192\nU(x)U\u03c9 (x) yields the adjoint local rotation\nn(x) \u2192 n\u03c9 (x) = U\u03c9\u2020 (x)U \u2020 (x)T3 U(x)U\u03c9 (x) = U\u03c9\u2020 (x)n(x)U\u03c9 (x),\n\n(2.25)\n\nwhose infinitesimal form is given for U\u03c9 (x) = exp(ig\u03c9(x)) = exp(igTA \u03c9A (x)) by\n\u03b4\u03c9 n(x) := n\u03c9 (x) \u2212 n(x) = ig[n(x), \u03c9(x)].\n\n(2.26)\n\nThis is indeed the desired transformation property for the color field under the local\nrotation.\nThe conventional Abelian projection in the SU(2) case corresponds to taking the\nspecial limit of the color field; the color field is chosen to be uniform in the third\ndirection at whole space-time points:\nn(x) \u2261 n\u221e := (0, 0, 1) \u21d0\u21d2 n(x) \u2261 n\u221e := T3 .\n\n(2.27)\n\nEven in this limit, we have still the U(1) local symmetry for the U(1) local rotation\naround the uniform color field n\u221e := (0, 0, 1), which does not change the uniform\ncolor vector. This limit is identified with the partial gauge fixing corresponding to\nthe Abelian projection\nSU(2)local \u2192 U(1)local .\n(2.28)\n\n2.2\n\nSU (3) case\n\nWe now consider the SU(3) case. We consider a real scalar field \u03c6(x) taking its value\nin the Lie algebra su(3) of SU(3):\n\u03c6(x) = \u03c6A (x)TA ,\n\n\u03c6A (x) \u2208 R. (A = 1, 2, * * * , 8)\n\n(2.29)\n\nThus, \u03c6 is a traceless and Hermitian matrix for real \u03c6A , i.e., tr(\u03c6) = 0 and \u03c6\u2020 =\n\u03c6, since we have chosen the traceless generators to be Hermitian; tr(TA ) = 0 and\n(TA )\u2020 = TA . The Hermitian matrix \u03c6 can be cast into the diagonal form \u039b using a\nsuitable unitary matrix U \u2208 SU(3)(\u2282 U(3)):\nU(x)\u03c6(x)U \u2020 (x) = diag(\u039b1 (x), \u039b2 (x), \u039b3 (x)) := \u039b(x),\n\n(2.30)\n\nwith real elements \u039b1 , \u039b2 , \u039b3 . The traceless condition leads to\ntr(\u03c6(x)) = tr(\u039b(x)) = \u039b1 (x) + \u039b2 (x) + \u039b3 (x) = 0.\n6\n\n(2.31)\n\n\fThe diagonal matrix \u039b is expressed as a linear combination of two diagonal generators\nH1 and H2 belonging to the Cartan subalgebra as\nU(x)\u03c6(x)U \u2020 (x) = a(x)H1 + b(x)H2 .\n\n(2.32)\n\nFrom (2.30), we obtain the relation\n~*\u03c6\n~ (A, B = 1, 2, * * * , 8)\n2tr(\u03c62 ) =2\u03c6A \u03c6B tr(TA TB ) = \u03c6A \u03c6B \u03b4 AB = \u03c6A \u03c6A = \u03c6\n=2tr(\u039b2 ) = 2(\u039b21 + \u039b22 + \u039b23 ) = a2 + b2 .\n\n(2.33)\n\nAt this stage, the color vector field n(x) defined by n(x) = \u03c6(x)/|\u03c6(x)| is an\neight-dimensional unit vector, i.e.,\nn(x) * n(x) = nA (x)nA (x) = 2tr(n(x)2 ) = 1 (A = 1, 2, * * * , 8).\n\n(2.34)\n\nIn other words, n belongs to the 7-sphere, n \u2208 S 7 , or the target space of the map\nis S 7 ; n : RD \u2192 S 7 . Hence, n(x) has 7 independent degrees of freedom at each x.\nHowever, the group G does not act transitively on the manifold of the target space\nS 7 . 1 If the stationary subgroup H\u0303 of G is nontrivial,2 then the transitive target\nspace M is identified with the left coset space, G/H\u0303, where G/H\u0303 \u2282 M. Thus, we\nhave\nx \u2208 RD \u2192 n(x) := \u03c6(x)/|\u03c6(x)| \u2208 G/H\u0303 \u2282 S 7 .\n(2.35)\nThen the unit color field n(x) \u2208 su(3) is expressed as\n\nn(x) =(cos \u03b8(x))n1 (x) + (sin \u03b8(x))n2 (x),\nn1 (x) :=U \u2020 (x)H1 U(x),\n\nn2 (x) := U \u2020 (x)H2 U(x),\n\n(2.36)\n\nwhere a2 + b2 = 1 is used to rewrite a and b in terms of an angle \u03b8: cos \u03b8(x) = a(x),\nsin \u03b8(x) = b(x). Note that n1 (x) and n2 (x) are Hermitian and traceless unit fields:\nn\u2020j (x) = nj (x),\n\ntr(nj (x)) = 0,\n\n2tr(nj (x)2 ) = 1 (j \u2208 {1, 2}).\n\n(2.37)\n\nThis is also the case for the color field n(x):\nn\u2020 (x) = n(x),\n\ntr(n(x)) = 0,\n\n2tr(n(x)2 ) = 1.\n\n(2.38)\n\nIt should be remarked that U used in the expression for n1 and n2 is regarded as\nan element of SU(3) rather than U(3), since a diagonal generator of a unit matrix in\nU(3) commutes trivially with all the other generators of U(3). It is easy to see that\nthe SU(2) case considered in the previous subsection is reproduced in a similar way\nto the SU(3) case we have just considered.\n1\n\nWe say that the group G acts transitively on the manifold M if any two elements of M are\nconnected by a group transformation.\n2\nWe define the stationary subgroup as a subgroup of G that consists of all the group elements\nh that leave the reference state (or highest weight state) |\u039b > invariant up to a phase factor:\nh|\u039b >= |\u039b > ei\u03c6(h) .\n\n7\n\n\fFor concreteness, we can adopt the Gell-Mann matrices \u03bbA for SU(3) to denote\nthe generators TA = \u03bbA /2 (A = 1, * * * , 8):\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n0 1 0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n1\n\u03bb =\uf8ed 1 0 0 \uf8f8,\n0 0 0\n\n0 0 1\n\uf8ec\n4\n\u03bb =\uf8ed 0 0 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8,\n1 0 0\n\n0 0 0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\u03bb6 = \uf8ed 0 0 1 \uf8f8 ,\n0 1 0\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n0 \u2212i 0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n2\n\u03bb = \uf8ed i 0 0 \uf8f8,\n0 0 0\n\n0 0 \u2212i\n\uf8ec\n5\n\u03bb =\uf8ed 0 0 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8,\ni 0 0\n\n0 0 0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\u03bb7 = \uf8ed 0 0 \u2212i \uf8f8 ,\n0 i 0\n\nFor the Gell-Mann matrices, we have\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n1 0 0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n3\n\u03bb = \uf8ed 0 \u22121 0 \uf8f8 ,\n0 0 0\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n1 0 0\n1 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\u03bb8 = \u221a \uf8ed 0 1 0 \uf8f8 .\n3 0 0 \u22122\n\nf123 = 1,\nf147 = f246 = f\u221a257 = f345 = \u2212f156 = \u2212f367 = 21 ,\nf458 = f678 = 23 ,\nand\n\nd118\nd146\nd247\nd448\n\n= d228\n= d157\n= d366\n= d558\n\n= d338\n= d256\n= d377\n= d668\n\n= \u2212d888 = \u221a13 ,\n= d344 = d355 = 21 ,\n= \u2212 21 ,\n= d778 = \u2212 2\u221a1 3 .\n\n(2.39)\n\n(2.40)\n\n(2.41)\n\nFor this choice: H1 = T3 = \u03bb3 /2 and H2 = T8 = \u03bb8 /2,\n\u221a\nb(x) = \u2212 3\u039b3 (x).\n\n(2.42)\n\nn8 (x) = U \u2020 (x)T8 U(x) = n2 (x).\n\n(2.43)\n\na(x) = 2\u039b1(x) + \u039b3 (x) = \u22122\u039b2 (x) \u2212 \u039b3 (x),\nHere we use the notation n3 , n8 instead of n1 , n2 :\nn3 (x) = U \u2020 (x)T3 U(x) = n1 (x),\n2.2.1\n\nIndependent degrees of freedom carried by the color field n\n\nFrom the viewpoint of reformulating the theory, it is important to recognize which\nare the independent degrees of freedom to describe the theory in question. For SU(3)\nwith a rank of two, it appears to be convenient to introduce two unit vector fields\nn3 (x) and n8 (x). In fact, this choice has been adopted as a conventional approach by\nmany authors. However, we point out that this choice is not necessarily unique from\nthe viewpoint of reformulating the theory, as shown below.\nFirst, we observe that under the three types of products, nk (k = 3, 8) satisfy\nn3 * n3 = 1,\n\nn3 \u00d7 n3 = 0,\n\nn3 * n8 = 0,\n\nn3 \u00d7 n8 = 0,\n\nn8 * n8 = 1,\n\nn8 \u00d7 n8 = 0,\n\n(2.44a)\n(2.44b)\n\nand\n1\nn3 \u2217 n3 = \u221a n8 ,\n3\n\n1\nn3 \u2217 n8 = \u221a n3 ,\n3\n8\n\n\u22121\nn8 \u2217 n8 = \u221a n8 ,\n3\n\n(2.44c)\n\n\fwhere the equations (2.44c) are also written as ni \u2217 nj = dijk nk , i, j, k \u2208 {3, 8}. 3\nFor SU(3), we find from (2.44a), (2.44b) and (2.44c) that n3 and n8 constitute a\nclosed set of variables under all multiplications: *, \u00d7, and \u2217. In particular, it is\nimportant\n\u221a to note that n8 can be constructed from n3 by the multiplication \u2217, i.e.,\nn8 = 3n3 \u2217 n3 . (In other words, n8 is a composite of n3 .) In view of this, only\nthe field n3 is an independent variable. This interpretation does not necessarily agree\nwith the conventional approach. This case will be called the maximal case.\nOn the other hand, we find that the field n8 is closed under self-multiplication:\nn8 * n8 =1,\n\n(2.46a)\n\nn8 \u00d7 n8 =0,\n\u22121\nn8 \u2217 n8 = \u221a n8 .\n3\n\n(2.46b)\n(2.46c)\n\nThis constitutes a novel option, which will be called the minimal case.\nThis observation suggests that in the maximal or minimal case for SU(3), one\nof the fields, n3 or n8 , is sufficient as a representative of the color field n to rewrite\nYang-Mills theory based on the change of variables, and that the choice of n3 or n8\nas a fundamental variable can be used an alternative for the equivalent reformulation\nof Yang-Mills theory. This statement will be verified in the next section.\nIt should be noted, however, that n3 carry 6 degrees of freedom, while n8 carry 4\ndegrees of freedom. Therefore, the other fields to be introduced for rewriting YangMills theory must provide the remaining degrees of freedom in each case. In particular,\nfor the SU(2) gauge group, n carries always 2 degrees of freedom and there is no\ndistinction between the maximal and minimal cases.\nFor N \u2265 4, there exist intermediate cases other than the maximal and minimal\ncases. To see this, it is instructive to consider the SU(4) case explicitly, as outlined\nin the next section. This also clarifies the meaning of this type of classification and\nhelps to correct a misunderstanding in the previous work [7] regarding the number of\nindependent degrees of freedom.\n2.2.2\n\nMaximal and minimal cases defined by degeneracies\n\nWe now show that the unit color field n is classified into two categories, maximal and\nminimal, according to the degeneracies of the eigenvalues. By taking into account\nthe fact that the three eigenvalues obey two equations,\n\u039b1 (x) + \u039b2 (x) + \u039b3 (x) = 0,\n3\n\n1\n\u039b1 (x)2 + \u039b2 (x)2 + \u039b3 (x)2 = ,\n2\n\n(2.47)\n\nThis is equivalent to the relationship between n3 and n8 of\n{ni , nj } =\n\n1 ij\n\u03b4 1 + dijk nk ,\n3\n\ni, j, k \u2208 {3, 8},\n\n(2.45a)\n\n{Ti , Tj } =\n\n1 ij\n\u03b4 1 + dijk Tk ,\n3\n\ni, j, k \u2208 {3, 8},\n\n(2.45b)\n\nfollowing from the identity\n\nwhere we have used the identity for the anticommutator of the generators (2.9) and dija =\n2Tr({Ti , Tj }Ta ) = 0 (a \u2208 {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}) from (2.10).\n\n9\n\n\fwe find that only one degree of freedom is independent, which corresponds to the\nchoice of \u03b8.

The total set is invariant under the action of the Weyl group.\nIn particular, for (a, b) = (0, \u00b11) or equivalently \u03b8 = \u03c0/2, 3\u03c0/2, the color field\nn(x) can be written using only n8 (x), i.e., n(x) = \u00b1n8 (x), and n3 (x) disappears\nfrom the color field. In other minimal cases, n3 (x) reappears in the color field n(x),\nand the \u03b8 = \u03c0/2, 3\u03c0/2 cases may appear to be special and distinct from other cases.\nAs the structure of the degenerate matrix \u039b indicates, however, the color field n(x)\nhas the same degrees of freedom in all the minimal cases. Therefore, the difference is\napparent due to the special choice of the Gell-Mann matrices. In fact, we find that\nn8 (x) covers only the four dimensional internal space SU(3)/U(2), i.e., the complex\nprojective space P 2(C). Also,\nn8 = U \u2020 T8 U = U \u2020 H2 U \u2208 SU(3)/U(2) = P 2 (C),\n\n(2.52)\n\n[T8 , TA ] = 0. (A = 1, 2, 3, 8)\n\n(2.53)\n\nin agreement with the above definition (II). This originates from the fact that the\nSU(2) \u00d7 U(1)8 = U(2) rotations caused by four generators {T1 , T2 , T3 , T8 } do not\nchange (the direction of) n\u221e\n8 := T8 , since the only generators commuting with T8 are\nthe four generators {T1 , T2 , T3 , T8 } specified by the standard Gell-Mann matrices:\n{ 16 \u03c0, 21 \u03c0, 65 \u03c0, 76 \u03c0, 23 \u03c0, 11\n\u03c0}\n6\n\nThus, all choices of \u03b8 \u2208\nshould be treated on an equal\nfooting, but the apparently simplest way to define the color field in the minimal case\nis to choose \u03b8 = \u03c0/2, i.e., n(x) = n8 (x).\n2.2.4\n\nMaximal case\n\nIn particular, for (a, b) = (\u00b11, 0) or equivalently \u03b8 = 0, \u03c0, the color field n(x) can\nbe written using only n3 (x), i.e., n(x) = \u00b1n3 (x), and n8 (x) disappears from the\nexpression of the color field n(x). In the other maximal cases with \u03b8 6= 0, \u03c0, n(x)\ncontains both n3 (x) and n8 (x). The appearances of the representation n(x) are\nconsiderably different from each other in the two cases. However, both\u221areveal the same\nphysical situation because n8 (x) is constructed from n3 (x) as n8 (x) = 3n3 (x)\u2217n3 (x).\nTherefore, it is sufficient for us to consider n3 (x) to define the color field n(x). In\nfact, n3 (x) covers the six-dimensional internal or target space SU(3)/(U(1) \u00d7 U(1)),\ni.e., the flag space F2 :\nn3 = U \u2020 T3 U = U \u2020 H1 U \u2208 SU(3)/(U(1) \u00d7 U(1)) = F2 ,\n\n(2.54)\n\nin agreement with the above definition (I). This is understood from the fact that the\nU(1) \u00d7 U(1) rotations caused by the two diagonal generators {T3 , T8 } do not change\n(the direction of) n\u221e\n3 := T3 , since the only generators commuting with T3 are the two\ngenerators {T3 , T8 }:\n[T3 , T3 ] = 0, [T3 , T8 ] = 0.\n(2.55)\nThus the easiest way to define the color field in the maximal case is to choose \u03b8 = 0,\ni.e., n(x) = n3 (x). Of course, this does not prohibit the introduction of both n3 (x)\nand n8 (x) for convenience. 4\n4\n\nIn the original approach for decomposing the SU (3) Yang-Mills gauge field [18], two fields n3\nand n8 are introduced from the beginning as they were fundamental variables. Therefore, this option\n\n11\n\n\f2.3\n2.3.1\n\nSU (N ) case\nGeneral consideration\n\nWe consider the su(N)-valued field\n\u03c6(x) = \u03c6A (x)TA . (A = 1, 2, * * * , N 2 \u2212 1)\n\n(2.56)\n\nThus, \u03c6 is a traceless and Hermitian matrix for real \u03c6A , i.e., tr(\u03c6) = 0 and \u03c6\u2020 = \u03c6,\nsince tr(TA ) = 0 and (TA )\u2020 = TA . Therefore, it can be cast into the diagonal form \u039b\nusing a unitary matrix U \u2208 SU(N) \u2282 U(N):\nU(x)\u03c6(x)U \u2020 (x) = diag(\u039b1 (x), \u039b2 (x), * * * , \u039bN (x)) := \u039b(x),\n\n(2.57)\n\nwhere \u039ba (a = 1, * * * , N) are real and satisfy\ntr(\u03c6(x)) = tr(\u039b(x)) =\n\nN\nX\n\n\u039ba (x) = 0.\n\n(2.58)\n\nj=1\n\nTherefore, the diagonal matrix \u039b is expressed as a linear combination of r = N \u2212 1\ndiagonal generators Hj (j = 1, 2, * * * , r) belonging to the Cartan subalgebra\n\u2020\n\nU(x)\u03c6(x)U (x) =\n\nr\nX\n\naj (x)Hj ,\n\n(2.59)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere aj (x) is obtained as a linear combination of \u039bj (x).\nBy taking into account the relation\n~*\u03c6\n~ =\u03c6A \u03c6A\n\u03c6\n=2tr(\u03c62 ) = 2tr(U\u03c6U \u2020 U\u03c6U \u2020 )\n\nr\nX\n\n2aj ak tr(Hj Hk ) =\n\nj,k=1\n\n=2tr(\u039b2 ) = 2\n\nr\nX\n\nr\nX\n\na2j\n\nj=1\n\n\u039b2j ,\n\n(2.60)\n\nj=1\n\nthe unit color field n(x) \u2208 su(N) satisfying\nn(x) * n(x) = nA (x)nA (x) = 2tr(n(x)2 ) = 1\n\n(2.61)\n\nis expressed as\nn(x) =\n\nr\nX\n\naj (x)nj (x),\n\nnj (x) := U \u2020 (x)Hj U(x),\n\n(2.62)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere each coefficient aj belongs to the (r \u2212 1)-sphere S r\u22121 :\nr\nX\n\nj=1\n\naj (x)2 = n(x) * n(x) = nA (x)nA (x) = 2tr(n(x)2 ) = 1.\n\nis included in the maximal case.\n\n12\n\n(2.63)\n\n\fSince each field nj (x) (j = 1, * * * , r) is a traceless and Hermitian unit field:\nn\u2020j (x) = nj (x),\n\ntr(nj (x)) = 0,\n\n2tr(nj (x)2 ) = 1 (j = 1, * * * , r),\n\n(2.64)\n\nthe color field n(x) satisfies the same property:\nn\u2020 (x) = n(x),\n\ntr(n(x)) = 0,\n\n2tr(n(x)2 ) = 1.\n\n(2.65)\n\nNote that the U used for the expression for nj is regarded as an element of the SU(N)\ngroup rather than U(N), since a diagonal generator in U(N) commutes with all other\ngenerators of U(N).\nAt this stage, the color field n(x) is an (N 2 \u22122)-dimensional vector, i.e., nA nA = 1\n(A = 1, 2, * * * , N 2 \u2212 1), or n(x) has (N 2 \u2212 2) degrees of freedom at each x.

Which root vector is\npositive depends on the definition of the positive root, while the numbers of positive\nroots and simple roots do not depend on their definitions. For example, the positive\nroots according to our definition [17] are as follows:\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1 3\n1 3\n, 0), (\u2212 ,\n, 0),\n(1, 0, 0), ( ,\n2 2\n2 2\n1 1\n2\n1 2\n1 1\n2\n( , \u221a , \u221a ), (0, \u2212 \u221a , \u221a ), ( , \u221a , \u221a ).\n(2.76)\n2 2 3 6\n2 2 3 6\n3 6\nThe simple roots are \u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b13:\n1\n\n\u03b1 := (1, 0, 0),\n\n\u221a\n1 3\n, 0),\n\u03b1 := (\u2212 ,\n2 2\n2\n\n1 2\n\u03b13 := (0, \u2212 \u221a , \u221a ),\n3 6\n\n(2.77)\n\nand other roots are expressed as linear combinations of the simple roots as indicated\nabove.

This\nis the minimal case. The last three equations in (2.79) show that the field n2 and\nn3 are closed under multiplication. This corresponds to intermediate cases. The first\nthree equations in (2.79) show that n1 , n2 and n3 are closed under multiplication.\nThis constitutes the maximal case. It should be remarked that n1 , n2 and n3 in the\nmaximal case are constructed from the single color field n, which is sufficient for our\npurposes.\nIn all cases (maximal, intermediate and minimal), the single color field n(x) is\nconstructed by choosing the appropriate matrix T such that\nn(x) = U \u2020 (x)T U(x) \u2208 G/H\u0303.\n\n(2.80)\n\nThe minimal case occurs when three of the four eigenvalues are equal, which corresponds to the largest stability subgroup H\u0303 = U(3), e.g.,\n\uf8eb\n\n1 \uf8ec\n1\n\uf8ec\nT15 = \u03bb15 = \u221a \uf8ec\n2\n2 6\uf8ed\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n0 0\n0 0\n1 0\n0 \u22123\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f8\n\nH\u0303 =\n\nU(3) \u00d7 U(1)\n= U(3).\nU(1)\n\n(2.81)\n\nThe two intermediate cases are obtained for the stability subgroup H\u0303 = U(2)\u00d7SU(2),\ne.g.,\n\uf8eb\n\n1 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nT = \u221a \uf8ec\n2 2\uf8ed\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n0 0\n0\n1 0\n0\n0 \u22121 0\n0 0 \u22121\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n\u221a\n2 \u03bb8 1 \u03bb15\n+\u221a\n,\n=\u221a\n3 2\n3 2\n\nH\u0303 =\n\nU(2) \u00d7 U(2)\n= U(2)\u00d7SU(2).\nU(1)\n(2.82)\n\nand H\u0303 = U(2) \u00d7 U(1), e.g.,\n\uf8eb\n\n1\n1\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nT3 = \u03bb3 = \uf8ec\n2\n2\uf8ed\n\n1 0 0 0\n0 \u22121 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f8\n\nH\u0303 =\n\nU(1) \u00d7 U(1) \u00d7 U(2)\n= U(1)\u00d7U(2), (2.83)\nU(1)\n\n16\n\n\for\n\uf8eb\n\n1\n1 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nT8 = \u03bb8 = \u221a \uf8ec\n2\n2 3\uf8ed\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\n0 \u22122 0\n0 0 0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f8\n\nH\u0303 =\n\nU(2) \u00d7 U(1) \u00d7 U(1)\n= U(2) \u00d7 U(1).\nU(1)\n\n(2.84)\nThe maximal case occurs when all (four) eigenvalues are distinct, which corresponds\nto the smallest stability subgroup H\u0303 = U(1)3 , e.g.,\n\uf8eb\n\n1 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nT = \u221a \uf8ec\n2 5\uf8ed\n\u2032\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n0 0\n0\n2 0\n0\n0 \u22121 0\n0 0 \u22122\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2212 5 \u03bb3\n15 \u03bb8 2 30 \u03bb15\n=\n+\n+\n,\n10 2\n6 2\n15 2\n\nU(1)4\nH\u0303 =\n= U(1)3 .\nU(1)\n\n(2.85)\nHere the matrix has been chosen such that the absolute value of the elements is simple\nand as small as possible.\nIn this example, we can see the role of the three fields n1 , n2 , and n3 in constructing the three cases. Note that dimSU(4) = 15 and dimG/H\u0303 = dimG \u2212 dimH\u0303.\nFirst, we find that T15 commutes with T1 , T2 , * * * , T8 and T15 which constitute 9\ngenerators of U(3). Therefore, n3 spans the 15 \u2212 9 = 6 dimensional space:\nn3 = U \u2020 H3 U = U \u2020 T15 U \u2208 SU(4)/U(3) = P 3 (C),\n\n(2.86)\n\nwhich generates the color field n in the minimal case of SU(4), as shown in (2.81).\nSecond, we find that T8 commutes with T1 , T2 , T3 and T8 , which constitute 4\ngenerators of U(2), in addition to T15 as a generator of U(1). Therefore, n2 spans the\n15 \u2212 5 = 10-dimensional space:\nn2 = U \u2020 H2 U = U \u2020 T8 U \u2208 SU(4)/(U(2) \u00d7 U(1)),\n\n(2.87)\n\nwhich can be used to define the color field n in an intermediate case of SU(4) as\nshown in (2.84).\nThird, we find that T3 commutes with T3 ,\u221aT8 , T13 , T\u221a\n14 and T15 . Then\n14 and\n\u221a T13 , T2 \u221a\n1\n1\n1\ntwo linear combinations of T8 and T15 (i.e., 3 6T15 \u2212 3 3T8 and \u2212 3 6T15 \u2212 3 3T8 )\nconstitute 4 generators of U(2), in addition to T3 as a generator of U(1). Thus, n1\nspans the 15 \u2212 5 = 10-dimensional space:\nn1 = U \u2020 H1 U = U \u2020 T3 U \u2208 SU(4)/(U(2) \u00d7 U(1)),\n\n(2.88)\n\nwhich can be adopted as the color field n in an intermediate case of SU(4) as shown\nin (2.83).\nThe color field n in the maximal case of SU(4) is obtained by the following linear\ncombination of n1 , n2 and n3 as exemplified in (2.85):\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n15\n2 30\n\u2212 5\nn1 +\nn2 +\nn3 \u2208 SU(4)/U(1)3 = F3 ,\n(2.89)\nn=\n10\n6\n15\nwhich is consistent with the above consideration based on (2.79).\nFor larger N, there may exist more intermediate cases, although we do not discuss\nsuch cases here.\n17\n\n\fH\n\nFigure 1: The relationship between the original Yang-Mills (YM) theory and the reformulated Yang-Mills (YM') theory. A single color field n is introduced to enlarge the original\nYang-Mills theory with a gauge group G into the master Yang-Mills (M-YM) theory with the\nenlarged gauge symmetry G\u0303 = G \u00d7 G/H\u0303. The reduction conditions are imposed to reduce\nthe master Yang-Mills theory to the reformulated Yang-Mills theory with the equipollent\ngauge symmetry G\u2032 .\n\n3\n\nReduction condition and change of variables\n\nOur strategy for reformulating Yang-Mills theory is shown in Fig. 1. By introducing\na single color field n in the original Yang-Mills theory written in terms of the variable\nA\u03bc with an original gauge group G = SU(N), we obtain a gauge theory called the\nmaster Yang-Mills theory with the enlarged gauge symmetry G\u0303 = GA \u00d7 [G/H\u0303]n,\nwhere the degrees of freedom [G/H\u0303]n are possessed by the color field n. By imposing\na sufficient number of constraints, say, the reduction conditions, 5 to eliminate the\nextra degrees of freedom, the master Yang-Mills theory is reduced to the gauge theory\nreformulated in terms of new variables with the gauge symmetry G\u2032 = SU(N), say\nthe equipollent gauge symmetry,6 which is respected by the new variables.\nG \u0580 (enlargement) G\u0303 = GA \u00d7 [G/H\u0303]n\n\n\u0581 (reduction) G\u2032 .\n\n(3.1)\n\nThe reformulated Yang-Mills theory is written in terms of new variables, i.e., the\ncolor field n(x) and the other new fields.\nIn the reformulated Yang-Mills theory, the color field n(x) is given as a functional\nof the SU(N) Yang-Mills gauge field A\u03bc (x):\nn(x) = n[A ] (x).\n\n(3.2)\n\nOther new variables are also obtained from the original A\u03bc (x) by a change of variables\nthanks to the existence of this color field. In fact, we shall show later that imposing the\n5\n\nIn previous papers, we called the reduction condition the new maximal Abelian gauge (new\nMAG). However, this is misleading for SU (N ), N \u2265 3. Therefore, we do not use this terminology\nin this paper.\n6\nIn previous papers, we called the equipollent gauge transformation the gauge transformation II.\n\n18\n\n\freduction condition is a relevant prescription for obtaining n[A ] (x). For the moment,\ntherefore, we do not ask how this is achieved and we omit the subscript A of n[A ] to\nsimplify the notation, keeping the above comments in mind.\nWe require that the original SU(N) gauge field A\u03bc (x) is decomposed into two\nparts, V\u03bc (x) and X\u03bc (x):\nA\u03bc (x) = V\u03bc (x) + X\u03bc (x),\n(3.3)\nsuch that V\u03bc (x) transforms under the SU(N) gauge transformation \u03a9(x) identically\nto the original gauge field A\u03bc (x), while X\u03bc (x) transforms identical to an adjoint\nmatter field:\nV\u03bc (x) \u2192 V\u03bc\u2032 (x) = \u03a9(x)[V\u03bc (x) + ig \u22121 \u2202\u03bc ]\u03a9\u2020 (x),\n\nX\u03bc (x) \u2192\n\nX\u03bc\u2032 (x)\n\n\u2020\n\n= \u03a9(x)X\u03bc (x)\u03a9 (x),\n\n(3.4a)\n(3.4b)\n\nby way of a single n field, which transforms according to the adjoint representation:\nn(x) \u2192 n\u2032 (x) = \u03a9(x)n(x)\u03a9\u2020 (x).\n\n(3.4c)\n\nThe gauge transformation for the new variables is the equipollent gauge transformation, which should be compared with the original gauge transformation for A\u03bc (x):\nA\u03bc (x) \u2192 A\u03bc\u2032 (x) = \u03a9(x)[A\u03bc (x) + ig \u22121 \u2202\u03bc ]\u03a9\u2020 (x).\n\n(3.5)\n\nIn the following, we use the decomposition of the Lie algebra valued function F\ninto two parts, an H\u0303-commutative part FH\u0303 and the remaining part FG/H\u0303 :\nF (x) := FH\u0303 (x) + FG/H\u0303 (x) FH\u0303 (x) \u2208 L (H\u0303), FG/H\u0303 (x) \u2208 L (G/H\u0303), .\n\n(3.6)\n\nwhere\n[FH\u0303 (x), n(x)] = 0.\n\n(3.7)\n\nIn this decomposition, it should be remarked that H\u0303 does not necessarily agree with\nthe maximal torus subgroup H for SU(N), N \u2265 3. For SU(2), H\u0303 = H and the two\nparts are uniquely specified:\nF = FH + FG/H ,\n\nFH \u2208 L (H), FG/H \u2208 L (G/H).\n\n(3.8)\n\nThis is also written as\nF := Fk + F\u22a5 ,\n\n(3.9)\n\nwhich corresponds to the well-known decomposition of a vector F into the parallel\npart Fk and perpendicular part F\u22a5 in the vector form:\nF = Fk + F\u22a5 = n(n * F ) + n \u00d7 (F \u00d7 n),\nwhich follows from the simple identity, n \u00d7 (n \u00d7 F ) = n(n * F ) \u2212 (n * n)F .\n\n19\n\n(3.10)\n\n\f3.1\n\nMaximal case for SU (N )\n\nIn the maximal case, it is convenient to introduce a set of unit fields nj (x) (j =\n1, * * * , r) using the adjoint orbit representation:\nnj (x) = U \u2020 (x)Hj U(x),\n\nj \u2208 {1, 2, * * * , r},\n\n(3.11)\n\nwhere r := rankSU(N) = N \u2212 1 and Hj are the Cartan subalgebra. The fields nj (x)\ndefined in this way are indeed unit vectors, since\n(nj (x), nk (x)) = 2tr(nj (x)nk (x)) = 2tr(U \u2020 (x)Hj U(x)U \u2020 (x)Hk U(x))\n= 2tr(Hj Hk ) = (Hj , Hk ) = \u03b4jk .\n\n(3.12)\n\nThese unit vectors mutually commute,\n[nj (x), nk (x)] = 0,\n\nj, k \u2208 {1, 2, * * * , r},\n\n(3.13)\n\nsince Hj are the Cartan subalgebra obeying\n[Hj , Hk ] = 0,\n3.1.1\n\nj, k \u2208 {1, 2, * * * , r}.\n\n(3.14)\n\nDecomposition\n\nIn the maximal case, the decomposed fields V\u03bc (x) and X\u03bc (x) are specified by two\ndefining equations (conditions):\n(I) all nj (x) are covariant constants in the background V\u03bc (x):\n0 = D\u03bc [V ]nj (x) := \u2202\u03bc nj (x) \u2212 ig[V\u03bc (x), nj (x)],\n\n(j = 1, 2, * * * , r)\n\n(3.15)\n\n(II) X \u03bc (x) does not have the H-commutative part, i.e., X \u03bc (x)H = 0. In other\nwords, X\u03bc (x) is orthogonal to all nj (x):\nA\n(nj (x), X\u03bc (x)) := 2tr(nj (x)X\u03bc (x)) = nA\nj (x)X\u03bc (x) = 0. (j = 1, 2, * * * , r) (3.16)\n\nIt should be remarked that the defining equations are invariant under the gauge\ntransformation (3.4).\nFirst, we determine the X\u03bc field by solving the defining equations. For this\npurpose, we take into account the following identity: Any su(N) Lie algebra valued\nfunction F can be decomposed into the H-commutative part FH and the remaining\nG/H part FG/H [7, 21]: 7\nF := FH + FG/H :=\n\nr=N\nX\u22121\n\nnj (nj , F ) +\n\nr=N\nX\u22121\n\n[nj , [nj , F ]].\n\n(3.18)\n\nj=1\n\nj=1\n\nThe derivation of this identity is given in Appendix B.

(j = 1, 2, * * * , r = N \u2212 1)\n\n(3.24)\n\nSuch an H-commutative part (or a parallel part in the vector form) C\u03bc (x) in V\u03bc (x)\nis not determined uniquely from the first defining equation (3.15) alone. However, it\nis determined by the second defining equation as shown above. In view of this, we\nfurther decompose V\u03bc (x) into C\u03bc (x) and B\u03bc (x):\nV\u03bc (x) = C\u03bc (x) + B\u03bc (x).\n\n(3.25)\n\nApplying the identity (3.18) to C\u03bc (x) and by taking into account (3.24), we obtain\nC\u03bc (x) =\n\nr\nX\n\n(C\u03bc (x), nj (x))nj (x).\n\nj=1\n\n21\n\n(3.26)\n\n\fIf the remaining part B\u03bc (x), which is not H-commutative, i.e., [B\u03bc (x), nj (x)] 6= 0,\nis perpendicular to all nj (x):\n(B\u03bc (x), nj (x)) = 2tr(B\u03bc (x)nj (x)) = 0,\n\n(j = 1, 2, * * * , r)\n\n(3.27)\n\nthen we have\n(A\u03bc (x), nj (x)) = (V\u03bc (x), nj (x)) = (C\u03bc (x), nj (x)).\n\n(3.28)\n\nConsequently, the H-commutative part C\u03bc (x) is\nC\u03bc (x) =\n\nr\nX\n\n(A\u03bc (x), nj (x))nj (x).\n\n(3.29)\n\nj=1\n\nand the remaining part B\u03bc (x) is determined as\nB\u03bc (x) = ig \u22121\n\nr\nX\n\n8\n\n[nj (x), \u2202\u03bc nj (x)].\n\n(3.30)\n\nj=1\n\nIn fact, it is easy to verify that this expression indeed satisfies (3.27) and that\nD\u03bc [B]nj (x) = \u2202\u03bc nj (x) \u2212 ig[B\u03bc (x), nj (x)] = 0 (j = 1, 2, * * * , r).\n\n(3.31)\n\nThere are other ways of deriving the same result. 9\nThus, once a full set of color fields nj (x) is given, the original gauge field has the\nfollowing decomposition in the Lie algebra form:\nA\u03bc (x) = V\u03bc (x) + X\u03bc (x) = C\u03bc (x) + B\u03bc (x) + X\u03bc (x),\n\n(3.32a)\n\nwhere each part is expressed in terms of A\u03bc (x) and nj (x) as\nC\u03bc (x) =\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\n(A\u03bc (x), nj (x))nj (x) =\n\ncj\u03bc (x)nj (x),\n\n(3.32b)\n\nj=1\n\nj=1\n\nB\u03bc (x) =ig \u22121\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\n[nj (x), \u2202\u03bc nj (x)],\n\n(3.32c)\n\nj=1\n\nX\u03bc (x) = \u2212 ig\n\n\u22121\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\n[nj (x), D\u03bc [A ]nj (x)].\n\n(3.32d)\n\nj=1\n\nIn what follows, the summation over the index j should be understood when it is\nrepeated, unless otherwise stated.\nEquivalently, the decomposition (3.32) is written in the vector form as\nA\u03bc (x) = V\u03bc (x) + X\u03bc (x) = C\u03bc (x) + B\u03bc (x) + X\u03bc (x),\n8\n\n(3.33a)\n\nThe SU(2) version in the vector form is expressed as B\u03bc (x) = g \u22121 \u2202\u03bc n(x) \u00d7 n(x).\nFor example, the same expression for V\u03bc is also obtained by solving the defining equations\nas follows. Taking into account the commutator of the first defining equation (3.15) with nj , we\nhave ig \u22121 [nj (x), \u2202\u03bc nj P\n(x)] = ig \u22121 [nj (x), ig[V\u03bc (x), nj (x)]]\n[nj (x), [nj (x), V\u03bc (x)]]. Then we obtain\nP=\nr\nr\nthe relation V\u03bc (x) = j=1 (V\u03bc (x), nj (x))nj (x) + ig \u22121 j=1 [nj (x), \u2202\u03bc nj (x)]. The second defining\nequation (3.16) leads to (A\u03bc (x), nj (x)) = (V\u03bc (x), nj (x)), and hence we have (3.23).\n9\n\n22\n\n\fwhere each part is expressed in terms of A\u03bc (x) and nj (x) as\nC\u03bc (x) :=\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\nj=1\n\nB\u03bc (x) :=g \u22121\n\n(A\u03bc (x) * nj (x))nj (x) =\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\nj=1\n\nX\u03bc (x) =g \u22121\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\ncj\u03bc (x)nj (x),\n\n(\u2202\u03bc nj (x) \u00d7 nj (x)),\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\nj=1\n\n(3.33b)\n\nj=1\n\n(nj (x) \u00d7 D\u03bc [A]nj (x)).\n\n(3.33c)\n(3.33d)\n\nAll nj (x) fields in the maximal case are constructed from a single color field n(x).\nTherefore, a single color field n(x) is sufficient to specify the decomposition. See\nsection 4.1 for the explicit form.\nFinally, we point out that another equivalent expression is obtained in a slightly\ndifferent way. The differentiation of nk (x) yields the relation\n\u2202\u03bc nk (x) = [\u2202\u03bc U \u2020 (x)U(x), nk (x)].\n\n(3.34)\n\nIf we require the covariant constantness for all nk (x) in the background of V\u03bc (x):\nD\u03bc [V ]nk (x) := \u2202\u03bc nk (x) \u2212 ig[V\u03bc (x), nk (x)] = 0,\n\n(3.35)\n\nthe following relation must hold for all nk (x) by taking into account the relation\n(3.34).\n[V\u03bc (x) + ig \u22121 \u2202\u03bc U \u2020 (x)U(x), nk (x)] = 0.\n\n(3.36)\n\nThis shows that \u2202\u03bc U \u2020 (x)U(x) \u2212 igV\u03bc (x) \u2208 su(N) commutes with all nk (x) and that\nit can be written as a linear combination of all nj :\nV\u03bc (x) + ig \u22121 \u2202\u03bc U \u2020 (x)U(x) =\n\nr\nX\n\nj=1\n\ncj\u03bc (x)nj (x) \u2208 U(1)r ,\n\n(3.37)\n\nor\nV\u03bc (x) =\n\nr\nX\n\nj=1\n\nnj (x)cj\u03bc (x) \u2212 ig \u22121 \u2202\u03bc U \u2020 (x)U(x) =\n\nr\nX\n\nnj (x)cj\u03bc (x) + ig \u22121 U \u2020 (x)\u2202\u03bc U(x).\n\nj=1\n\n(3.38)\n\nHere V\u03bc is determined up to the terms parallel to nj . It is clear that B\u03bc (x) corresponds to the pure gauge form.\n3.1.2\n\nReduction in the maximal case\n\nWe wish to regard the new variables nA , cj\u03bc , X\u03bcA as those obtained by the change of\nvariables from the original gauge field:\nA\u03bcA =\u21d2 (nA , cj\u03bc , X\u03bcA ). (A = 1, * * * , N 2 \u2212 1; j = 1, . . . , N \u2212 1; \u03bc = 1, * * * , D)\n(3.39)\nIn the maximal case, the naive counting of independent degrees of freedom is as\nfollows.\n23\n\n\f\u2022 A\u03bc \u2208 L (G) = su(N) \u2192 (N 2 \u2212 1)D ,\n\u2022 n \u2208 L (G/H) = su(N) \u2212 [u(1) + * * * + u(1)] \u2192 N 2 \u2212 1 \u2212 (N \u2212 1) = N 2 \u2212 N ,\n\u2022 c\u03bc \u2208 L (H) = u(1) + * * * + u(1) \u2192 (N \u2212 1)D,\n\u2022 X\u03bc \u2208 L (G/H) = su(N) \u2212 u(N \u2212 1) \u2192 (N 2 \u2212 1)D \u2212 (N \u2212 1)D = (N 2 \u2212 N)D.\nIn the decomposition just given, therefore, there is an issue of mismatch for the\nindependent degrees of freedom. In fact, the new variables carry N 2 \u2212 N extra\ndegrees of freedom after the decomposition. Therefore, we must eliminate N 2 \u2212 N\ndegrees of freedom. For this purpose, we intend to impose N 2 \u2212 N constraints to\neliminate the extra degrees of freedom.\nThe transformation properties of the decomposed fields B\u03bc , C\u03bc , X\u03bc are uniquely\ndetermined, once we specify those for A\u03bc and n, as in the SU(2) case discussed in\nthe previous paper [8]. We consider the infinitesimal version of the enlarged gauge\ntransformation \u03b4\u03c9,\u03b8 , which is obtained by combining the local transformations for\n\u03b4\u03c9 A\u03bc and \u03b4\u03b8 n:\n\u03b4\u03c9 A\u03bc (x) = D\u03bc [A]\u03c9(x),\n\n\u03b4\u03b8 n(x) = gn(x) \u00d7 \u03b8\u22a5 (x),\n\n(3.40)\n\nwhere \u03b8\u22a5 \u2208 L (G/H).\nWe propose a constraint, which we call the reduction condition, as follows. To\nfind the reduction condition for G = SU(N), we calculate the SU(N) version of X\u03bc\nsquared as suggested from the SU(2) case:\ng 2 X\u03bc * X\u03bc = {nj \u00d7 D\u03bc [A]nj } * {nk \u00d7 D\u03bc [A]nk }\n= D\u03bc [A]nk * [(nj \u00d7 D\u03bc [A]nj ) \u00d7 nk ]\n\n= D\u03bc [A]nk * [(nk \u00d7 D\u03bc [A]nj ) \u00d7 nj ]\n\n= D\u03bc [A]nk * [(nj \u00d7 D\u03bc [A]nk ) \u00d7 nj ]\n\n= D\u03bc [A]nk * [D\u03bc [A]nk \u2212 (nj * D\u03bc [A]nk )nj ]\n\n= (D\u03bc [A]nj )2 ,\n\n(3.41)\n\nwhere the summation is over j, k and we have used the Jacobi identity in the third\nand fourth equalities and nj * D\u03bc [A ]nk = 0 in the last step.\nWe show that a reduction condition is obtained by minimizing the functional\nR[A, {nj }] :=\n\nZ\n\n1\ndD x (D\u03bc [A]nj )2 ,\n2\n\n24\n\n(3.42)\n\n\funder the enlarged gauge transformation.

In this case, A\u03bc is\ndecomposed into V\u03bc (x) and X\u03bc (x), i.e., A\u03bc (x) = V\u03bc (x) + X\u03bc (x), using only a single\ncolor field h(x) without other fields nj (x). 10 Here we require that V\u03bc (x) and X\u03bc (x)\nare expressed in terms of A\u03bc (x) and h(x) so as to obey the expected transformation\nproperty for the given gauge transformations of A\u03bc (x) and h(x).\n3.2.1\n\nDecomposition\n\nThe respective components V\u03bc (x) and X\u03bc (x) are specified by two defining equations\n(conditions):\n(I) h(x) is a covariant constant in the background V\u03bc (x):\n0 = D\u03bc [V ]h(x) := \u2202\u03bc h(x) \u2212 ig[V\u03bc (x), h(x)];\n\n(3.52)\n\n(II) X \u03bc (x) does not have the H\u0303-commutative part, i.e., X \u03bc (x)H\u0303 = 0:\nN \u22121\nX (x)H\u0303 := 1 \u2212 2\n[h, [h, *]] X \u03bc (x) = 0.\nN\n\u0012\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u0013\n\n(3.53)\n\nNote that condition (II) is different from the orthogonality to h(x): (X\u03bc (x), h(x)) :=\n2tr(X\u03bc (x)h(x)) = X\u03bcA (x)hA (x) = 0, which is not sufficient for characterizing the\nH\u0303-commutative part, in contrast to the H-commutative part. This is understood\nfrom an identity used in the minimal case, see Appendix. B.2.\nFirst, we apply the second defining equation (3.53) to X \u03bc (x):\nX\u03bc (x) =X\u03bc (x)H\u0303 +\n=\n\n2(N \u2212 1)\n[h, [h, X\u03bc (x)]]\nN\n\n2(N \u2212 1)\n[h, [h, X\u03bc(x)]].\nN\n\n(3.54)\n\n10\n\nIn the Gell-Mann representation of the generators, we adopt the last diagonal matrix TN 2 \u22121 =\nHN \u22121 for defining a single color field:\nh(x) := nr (x) = U \u2020 (x)Hr U (x).\n\n26\n\n(3.51)\n\n\fBy taking into account the first defining equation:\nD\u03bc [A ]h =D\u03bc [V ]h \u2212 ig[X\u03bc , h]\n=ig[h, X\u03bc],\n\n(3.55)\n\nX\u03bc (x) is expressed in terms of A\u03bc (x) and h(x) as\nX\u03bc (x) = \u2212ig \u22121\n\n2(N \u2212 1)\n[h(x), D\u03bc [A ]h(x)].\nN\n\n(3.56)\n\nNext, the V\u03bc field is expressed in terms of A\u03bc (x) and h(x):\nV\u03bc (x) =A\u03bc (x) \u2212 X\u03bc (x)\n2(N \u2212 1)\n=A\u03bc (x) + ig \u22121\n[h(x), D\u03bc [A ]h(x)].\nN\n\n(3.57)\n\nThus, V\u03bc (x) and X\u03bc (x) are written in terms of A\u03bc (x) once h(x) is given as a functional\nof A\u03bc (x).\nWe further decompose V\u03bc (x) into the H\u0303-commutative part C\u03bc (x) and the remaining part B\u03bc (x):\nV\u03bc (x) = C\u03bc (x) + B\u03bc (x).\n\n(3.58)\n\nWe rewrite (3.57) as\n2(N \u2212 1)\n[h(x), [h(x), A\u03bc (x)]]\nN\n2(N \u2212 1)\n[h(x), \u2202\u03bc h(x)].\n+ ig \u22121\nN\n\nV\u03bc (x) =A\u03bc (x) \u2212\n\n(3.59)\n\nThe first two terms on the right-hand side of (3.59) together constitute the H\u0303commutative part of A\u03bc (x), i.e., A\u03bc (x)H\u0303 .

This feature is discussed for SU(3)\nin more detail.\n3.2.2\n\nReduction in the minimal case\n\nThe minimal version of the reduction condition is obtained as follows. For G =\nSU(N), the stability group is H\u0303 = U(N \u2212 1). Therefore, the respective field variable\nhas the following degrees of freedom at each space-time point:\n\u2022 A\u03bc \u2208 L (G) = su(N) \u2192 (N 2 \u2212 1)D ,\n\u2022 h \u2208 L (G/H\u0303) = su(N) \u2212 u(N \u2212 1) \u2192 (N 2 \u2212 1) \u2212 (N \u2212 1)2 = 2(N \u2212 1) ,\n\u2022 C\u03bc \u2208 L (H\u0303) = u(N \u2212 1) \u2192 (N \u2212 1)2 D,\n\u2022 X\u03bc \u2208 L (G/H\u0303) = su(N) \u2212 u(N \u2212 1) \u2192 2(N \u2212 1)D.\nIf we wish to regard the new variables C\u03bc , X\u03bc and h as those obtained from the\noriginal field variable A\u03bc by the non-linear change of variables\nA\u03bc =\u21d2 (h, C\u03bc , X\u03bc ),\n\n(3.73)\n\nwe must give a procedure for eliminating the 2(N \u2212 1) extra degrees of freedom. Here\nwe do not include the variable B\u03bc in this counting, since it is written only in terms\nof h. For this purpose, we impose 2(N \u2212 1) reduction conditions \u03c7 = 0:\n\u2022 \u03c7 \u2208 G/H = su(N)/u(N \u2212 1) \u2192 2(N \u2212 1).\nBy introducing h in the original SU(N) Yang-Mills theory, the gauge symmetry is\nenlarged to SU(N)A \u00d7 [SU(N)/U(N \u2212 1)]h. The resulting theory is called the master\nYang-Mills theory. By imposing an appropriate constraint, say, the minimal version\nof the reduction condition, the master Yang-Mills theory is reduced to the gauge\ntheory with the gauge symmetry SU(N), say, the equipollent gauge symmetry, which\nis respected by the new variables.\n29\n\n\fRecall that X\u03bc is transformed according to the adjoint representation under the\nequipollent gauge transformation.

The field n3 belongs to G/H\u0303 = SU(3)/(U(1) \u00d7 U(1)) = F2 and hence\nhas 8\u22122\n\u221a = 6 degrees of freedom. As already pointed out, n8 is constructed from n3 by\nn8 = 3n3 \u2217 n3 . Note that B\u03bc is uniquely determined once n3 is fixed. The maximal\nAbelian potential C\u03bc commutes with both n3 and n8 and hence C\u03bc \u2208 H\u0303 = U(1)\u00d7U(1)\nhas 2D components. In contrast, X\u03bc has no components in the direction of H\u0303, i.e.,\nX\u03bc \u2208 G/H\u0303 has (8 \u2212 2)D = 6D components. Therefore, there are 6 extra degrees of\nfreedom after the transformation A\u03bc \u2192 (n, C\u03bc , X\u03bc ), although the number of degrees\nof freedom agrees between (n, A\u03bc ) and (n, C\u03bc , X\u03bc ).\nBy introducing a single color fields n, the original Yang-Mills theory with the\ngauge symmetry SU(3) is extended into a gauge theory with the enlarged gauge\n32\n\n\fgroup SU(3)\u00d7[SU(3)/(U(1)\u00d7U(1))], which we call the master Yang-Mills theory. To\neliminate the 6 extra degrees of freedom, we must impose 6 independent conditions,\nwhich we call the maximal version of the reduction condition. Consequently, we\ncan reduce the enlarged gauge symmetry to the original gauge symmetry, i.e., the\nequipollent gauge symmetry. Thus, we can regard\nA\u03bc \u2192 (n, C\u03bc , X\u03bc )\n\n(4.8)\n\nas the change of variables and obtain a new reformulation of SU(3) Yang-Mills theory\nwritten in terms of the new variables (n, C\u03bc , X\u03bc ).\n4.1.2\n\nReduction to SU(3): maximal case\n\nTo find the reduction condition for SU(3), we calculate the SU(3) version of the\nsquare of X\u03bc , as suggested from the SU(2) case.

Therefore, there are 4 extra\ndegrees of freedom associated with the transformation A\u03bc \u2192 (n8 , C\u03bc , X\u03bc), although\nthe number of degrees of freedom agrees between (n8 , A\u03bc ) and (n8 , C\u03bc , X\u03bc ). 11\n4.2.2\n\nReduction to SU(3): minimal case\n\nBy introducing a single color field n8 , the original Yang-Mills theory with gauge\nsymmetry SU(3) is extended to the master Yang-Mills theory with the enlarged\ngauge group, SU(3) \u00d7 [SU(3)/U(2)]. Therefore, we impose a constraint which we\ncall the minimal version of the reduction condition, to eliminate the 4 extra degrees\nof freedom. By imposing the minimal version of the reduction condition with the\nsame number of independent conditions as the extra degrees of freedom, we reduce\nthe enlarged gauge symmetry to the original gauge symmetry SU(3), which is called\nthe equipollent gauge symmetry. Thus, we can regard\nA\u03bc \u2192 (n8 , C\u03bc , X\u03bc )\n\n(4.29)\n\n11\nDefining n(1) := U \u2020 T1 U, n(2) := U \u2020 T2 U, n(3) := U \u2020 T3 U , we find that [n(a) , n8 ] = 0 (a =\n1, 2, 3, 8), since [Ta , T8 ] = 0 (a = 1, 2, 3, 8). For an arbitrary element V \u2208 H = U (2) generated by\n{T1 , T2 , T3 , T8 }, we define W := U \u2020 V U . Then we find that n(a) is transformed as\n\nn\u2032(a) := W \u2020 n(a) W = (U \u2020 V \u2020 U )(U \u2020 Ta U )(U \u2020 V U ) = U \u2020 (V \u2020 Ta V )U.\nIn particular, n8 is invariant, i.e., n\u20328 = n8 , since V T8 V \u2020 = T8 . Therefore, H\u0303 = U (2) in G = SU (3)\nleaves n8 invariant. In other words, n8 \u2208 G/H\u0303. Using the degrees of freedom of H\u0303, we can change\nn(1) , n(2) and n(3) without changing n8 .\n\n35\n\n\fas the change of variables and obtain a new reformulation of SU(3) Yang-Mills theory\nwritten in terms of the new variables (n8 , C\u03bc , X\u03bc ).\nIt turns out that X\u03bc (x) * X\u03bc (x) = 43 (D\u03bc [A]n8 (x))2 is invariant under the enlarged\ngauge transformation (4.26) when \u03c9\u22a5 = \u03b8\u22a5 .

We now reformulate a quantum Yang-Mills theory in terms of new\nvariables. For this purpose, we must specify the action and the integration measure.\nWe can immediately rewrite the Yang-Mills action SYM [A ] in terms of the new variables by substituting the transformation law (3.32) or (3.63) into the original gauge\nfield A in the Yang-Mills Lagrangian LYM [A ]. To write the integration measure explicitly in terms of the new variables, we need to know the Jacobian associated with\nthe change of variables from the original Yang-Mills gauge field to the new variables\nin the reformulated Yang-Mills theory.\n\n5.1\n\nJacobian for the nonlinear change of variables\n\nWe consider the Jacobian associated with the change of variables for the decomposition\nA\u03bc (x) = V\u03bc (x) + X\u03bc (x) = C\u03bc (x) + B\u03bc (x) + X\u03bc (x).\n(5.1)\nIn the following, we show that the Jacobian can be simplified by choosing appropriate\nbases in the group space without changing the physical content.\nFor G = SU(2), we have already introduced [10] the orthonormal basis (e1 (x), e2 (x), n(x))\nsatisfying the following relations in vector form using ea (x) = (eA\na (x)) , n(x) =\nA\n(n (x)):\nea (x) * eb (x) =\u03b4ab ,\n\nea (x) * n(x) = 0,\n\nea (x) \u00d7 eb (x) =\u01ebab n(x),\n\nn(x) * n(x) = 1,\n\nea (x) \u00d7 n(x) = \u2212\u01ebab eb (x)\n\n(a, b = 1, 2),\n\n(5.2)\n\nA\n, n(x) = nA (x)T A\nwhich are written in the Lie algebra form using ea (x) = eA\na (x)T\nas\n\ntr[ea (x)eb (x)] =\u03b4ab /2,\n\ntr[ea (x)n(x)] = 0,\n\n[ea (x), eb (x)] =i\u01ebab n(x),\n\ntr[n(x)n(x)] = 1/2,\n\n[ea (x), n(x)] = \u2212i\u01ebab eb (x)\n\n(a, b = 1, 2).\n\n(5.3)\n\nBy definition, C\u03bc (x) is parallel (or commutes with) n(x), i.e.,\n[C\u03bc (x), n(x)] = 0.\n\n(5.4)\n\nHence, for SU(2), C\u03bc (x) can be written as\nC\u03bc (x) = C\u03bc (x)n(x),\n\n(5.5)\n\nC\u03bcA (x) = C\u03bc (x)nA (x).\n\n(5.6)\n\nwhich has the components\nOn the other hand, B\u03bc (x) and X\u03bc (x) are orthogonal to (or noncommutative with)\nn(x),\nB\u03bc (x) * n(x) = 0, X\u03bc (x) * n(x) = 0,\n(5.7)\nand hence can be written using orthonormal bases {ea (x)} as\nB\u03bc (x) = B\u03bca (x)ea (x),\n\nX\u03bc (x) = X\u03bca (x)ea (x),\n37\n\n(5.8a)\n\n\fwhich yield the components\nB\u03bcA (x) = B\u03bca (x)eA\na (x),\n\nX\u03bcA (x) = X\u03bca (x)eA\na (x).\n\n(5.8b)\n\nFor G = SU(N) (N \u2265 3), we introduce complete orthonormal bases {ea , uj } for\nsu(N) where\nea \u2208 L (G/H\u0303),\n\nuj \u2208 L (H\u0303), (a = 1, * * * , dimG/H\u0303; j = 1, * * * , dimH\u0303)\n\n(5.9)\n\nA\nwhich satisfy the relations in vector form using ea (x) = (eA\na (x)) , uj (x) = (uj (x)):\n\nea (x) * eb (x) = \u03b4ab ,\n\nea (x) * uj (x) = 0 uj (x) * uk (x) = \u03b4jk ,\n\n(a, b = 1, * * * , dimG/H\u0303; j, k = 1, . . . , dimH\u0303),\n\n(5.10)\n\nA\nA\nA\nwhich are written in the Lie algebra form using ea (x) = eA\na (x)T , uj (x) = uj (x)T :\n\ntr[ea (x)eb (x)] =\u03b4ab /2,\n\ntr[ea (x)uj (x)] = 0,\n\ntr[uj (x)uk (x)] = 1/2\u03b4jk .\n\n(5.11)\n\nIt is instructive to note that uj reduces to a single color field n in SU(2).\nThe fields B\u03bc (x) and X\u03bc (x) are orthogonal to (or noncommutative with) all uj (x):\nB\u03bc (x) * uj (x) = 0,\n\nX\u03bc (x) * uj (x) = 0 (j = 1, * * * , dimH\u0303).\n\n(5.12)\n\nHence they can be written using the bases {ea (x)}:\nB\u03bc (x) =B\u03bca (x)ea (x) \u2208 L (G/H\u0303),\n\nX\u03bc (x) =X\u03bca (x)ea (x) \u2208 L (G/H\u0303) (a = 1, * * * , dimG/H\u0303).\n\n(5.13)\n\nBy definition, C\u03bc (x) can be written as\nC\u03bc (x) = C\u03bcj (x)uj (x) \u2208 L (H\u0303) (j = 1, * * * , dimH\u0303).\n\n(5.14)\n\nThus, in the minimal case, H\u0303 = U(N \u2212 1), and the decomposition is\na\nA\na\nA\nA\u03bcA (x) = C\u03bcj (x)uA\nj (x) + B\u03bc (x)ea (x) + X\u03bc (x)ea (x)\n\n(j = 1, * * * , dimH\u0303 = (N \u2212 1)2 ; a = 1, * * * , dimG/H\u0303 = 2N \u2212 2).\n\n(5.15)\n\nIn the maximal case, H\u0303 = H = U(1)N \u22121 and uj (x) reduce to nj (x) (j = 1, * * * , dimH\u0303),\nwhich mutually commute, i.e., [nj (x), nk (x)] = 0 (3.13).

For a while, we disregard this procedure, as it can\nbe carried out following the standard method.\nSecond, the color field n(x) is introduced to extend the original YM theory (see\nthe up arrow in Fig. 1) to the enlarged Yang-Mills theory called the master YangMills (M-YM) theory, which is defined by a partition function written in terms of\nboth n\u03b1 (x) and A\u03bcA (x) (see the top part in Fig. 1),\nZ\u0303YM =\n\nZ\n\n\u03b1\n\nDn\n\nZ\n\nDA\u03bcA exp(\u2212SYM [A ]).\n\n(5.21)\n\nZ\n\nDC\u03bdk\n\nZ\n\nDX\u03bdb J exp(\u2212S\u0303YM [n, C , X ]),\n\n(5.22)\n\nThird, we regard (5.21) as\nZ\u0303YM =\n\nZ\n\n\u03b2\n\nDn\n\nwhere J is the Jacobian associated with the change of variables, and the action\nS\u0303YM [n, C , X ] is obtained by substituting the decomposition (5.15) of A\u03bcA into SYM [A ]:\nS\u0303YM [n, C , X ] = SYM [A ].\n\n39\n\n(5.23)\n\n\fStarting with this form, we wish to obtain a new Yang-Mills (YM') theory written\nin terms of new variables (n\u03b2 , C\u03bdk , X\u03bdb ) (see the middle right part in Fig. 1), which\nis equipollent to the original Yang-Mills theory. Here, as already discussed in the\nprevious subsection,\n(n\u03b1 (x), A\u03bcA (x)) \u2192 (n\u03b2 (x), C\u03bdk (x), X\u03bdb (x))\n\n(5.24)\n\nshould be considered as a change of variables in the sense that n\u03b2 (x), C\u03bdk (x), X\u03bdb (x)\nbecome independent field variables in the new YM' theory.\nHowever, the M-YM has enlarged gauge symmetry, which is larger than the original gauge symmetry G = SU(N). Therefore, to obtain a YM' theory that is equipollent to the original YM theory, the extra gauge degrees of freedom must be eliminated.\nTo fix the enlarged gauge symmetry in the M-YM theory and retain only the same\ngauge symmetry as that in the original YM, therefore, we impose the constraint\n\u03c7[A , n] = 0 (the reduction condition), which is also written in terms of the new\nvariables as \u03c7\u0303 := \u03c7\u0303[n, C , X ] = 0. (see the diagonal down arrow in Fig. 1).\nThe constraint \u03c7[A , n] = 0 is introduced in the functional integral as follows. We\nwrite unity in the form\n1=\n\nZ\n\n\u03b8\n\n\u03b8\n\nD\u03c7 \u03b4(\u03c7 ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03b4\u03c7\u03b8\nD\u03b8\u03b4(\u03c7 ) det\n,\n\u03b4\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\n!\n\n(5.25)\n\nwhere \u03c7\u03b8 is the constraint written in terms of the gauge-transformed variables, i.e.,\n\u03c7\u03b8 := \u03c7[A , n\u03b8 ]. As an intermediate step for moving from M-YM to YM', we insert\nthis into the functional integral (5.22), and cast the partition function of the M-YM\ntheory into an intermediate form (see the middle right part in Fig. 1)\nZ\u0303YM =\n\nZ\n\nDn\u03b2\n\n\u00d7\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nDC\u03bdk\n\nZ\n\nDX\u03bdb J\n\n\u03b4\u03c7\u03b8\nD\u03b8\u03b4(\u03c7\u03b8 ) det\nexp(\u2212S\u0303YM [n, C , X ]).\n\u03b4\u03b8\n!\n\n(5.26)\n\nWe next perform the change of variables n \u2192 n\u03b8 obtained through a local rotation by\nangle \u03b8 and the corresponding gauge transformations for the other new variables C\u03bc\nand X\u03bc : C\u03bc , X\u03bc \u2192 C\u03bc\u03b8 , X\u03bc\u03b8 . From the gauge invariance of the action S\u0303YM [n, C , X ]\nand the measure Dn\u03b2 DC\u03bdk DX\u03bdb , we can rename the dummy integration variables\nn\u03b8 , C\u03bc\u03b8 , X\u03bc\u03b8 as n, C\u03bc , XR \u03bc , respectively. Thus, the integrand does not depend on \u03b8,\nand the gauge volume D\u03b8 can be removed:\nZ\u0303YM =\n\nZ\n\nD\u03b8\n\nZ\n\n\u03b2\n\nDn\n\nZ\n\nDC\u03bdk\n!\n\nZ\n\nDX\u03bdb J\n\n\u03b4\u03c7\nexp(\u2212S\u0303YM [n, C , X ]).\n\u00d7 \u03b4(\u03c7) det\n\u03b4\u03b8\n\n(5.27)\n\nThus, we have arrived at the reformulated YM' theory with the partition function:\n\u2032\nZYM\n=\n\nZ\n\nDn\u03b2\n\nZ\n\nDC\u03bdk\n\nZ\n\nDX\u03bdb J\u03b4(\u03c7\u0303)\u2206rc\nF P exp(\u2212S\u0303YM [n, C , X ]),\n40\n\n(5.28)\n\n\fwhere the reduction condition is written in terms of the new variables:\n\u03c7\u0303 := \u03c7\u0303[n, C , X ] := D \u03bc [V ]X\u03bc ,\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n(5.29)\n\n\u0011\n\n\u03b4\u03c7\n\u03b4\u03c7\nand \u2206rc\nF P := det \u03b4\u03b8 \u03c7=0 = det \u03b4n\u03b8 \u03c7=0 is the Faddeev-Popov determinant associated with the reduction condition. It is important to note that the independent\nvariables are regarded as n\u03b2 (x), C\u03bdk (x) and X\u03bdb (x) in the reformulated Yang-Mills\ntheory to simplify the Jacobian.\nAs already mentioned above, in order to obtain a well-defined Yang-Mills theory\nby completely fixing the gauge, we must impose the overall gauge fixing condition\n(see the down arrows in Fig. 1) in addition to the reduction condition. However, we\nhave omitted to write this procedure while simplifying the presentation, since the\noverall gauge fixing can be performed according to standard procedures. Moreover, a\nsystematic treatment of gauge fixing and the associated Faddeev-Popov determinant\nor the introduction of ghost fields can be carried out using the BRST symmetry of\nthe new theory. Although the BRST treatment can also be performed for the SU(N)\ncase following the method already performed for SU(2) [8], such a treatment is rather\ninvolved. Therefore, we have given a heuristic explanation based on the FaddeevPopov trick for SU(N) in the above, even though it is possible to develop the BRST\napproach. Some applications of this reformulation will be given in a subsequent paper.\n\n6\n\nConclusion and discussion\n\nIn this paper we have proposed a new version of the SU(N) Yang-Mills theory reformulated in terms of new field variables, which are obtained by a nonlinear change\nof variables from the original Yang-Mills gauge field. The basic idea of our reformulation originates from the Cho-Faddeev-Niemi decomposition of the gauge potential.\nHowever, our reformulation differs from other proposals [18, 19] for the gauge group\nSU(N), N \u2265 3, including the SU(3) case, which is most interesting from the physical\nviewpoint, although it agrees with the conventional approach for the SU(2) gauge\ngroup. In particular, we have mainly studied the maximal and minimal cases.\nThis reformulation of Yang-Mills theory has already been applied to a few physical\nproblems. It enables us to study the low-energy dynamics of Yang-Mills theory by\nexplicitly extracting the topological degrees of freedom such as magnetic monopoles\nand vortices [25]. Such topological configurations are believed to provide the dominant\ndegrees of freedom responsible for quark confinement from the viewpoint of dual\nsuperconductivity. Using the reformulation, the dual superconductivity in Yang-Mills\ntheory can indeed be understood in a gauge-invariant way, as demonstrated recently\nby a non-Abelian Stokes theorem for the Wilson loop operator [15]. The non-Abelian\nStokes theorem has played a crucial role in understanding the gauge-invariant meaning\nof the Abelian dominance in the Wilson loop operator [26], which was confirmed using\nthe Abelian projection approach. From this viewpoint, the reformulation given in this\npaper will give a useful framework for other applications, which will be discussed in\nsubsequent papers.\n\n41\n\n\fA\n\nSU (N ) group\n\nThe group G = SU(N) has rank N \u2212 1, and the Cartan subalgebra is constructed\nfrom N \u2212 1 diagonal generators Hk . Hence, there must be N(N \u2212 1) off-diagonal shift\noperators E\u03b1 , since dimSU(N) := N 2 \u2212 1 = (N \u2212 1) + N(N \u2212 1). Therefore, the total\nnumber of roots is N(N \u2212 1), of which there are N \u2212 1 simple roots, and the other\nroots are constructed as linear combinations of the simple roots.\nAn element of SU(N) in the fundamental representation is expressed by the N \u00d7\nN unitary matrices with determinant 1 that are generated by traceless Hermitian\nmatrices, i.e., N 2 \u2212 1 linearly independent generators T A (A = 1, * * * , N 2 \u2212 1). The\ngenerators are normalized as tr(TA TB ) = 12 \u03b4AB . The diagonal generator Hm is defined\nby\nm\nX\n1\n(Hm )ab = q\n( \u03b4ak \u03b4bk \u2212 m\u03b4a,m+1 \u03b4b,m+1 )\n(A.1)\n2m(m + 1) k=1\n1\ndiag(1, * * * , 1, \u2212m, 0, * * * , 0),\n(A.2)\n= q\n2m(m + 1)\n\nwhere for m = 1 to N \u2212 1, the first m diagonal elements (beginning from the upper\nleft-hand corner) of Hm are 1, the next element is \u2212m, and the rest of the diagonal\nelements are 0. Thus,\n\u221a Hm is traceless. Each off-diagonal generator E\u03b1 has a single\nnonzero element 1/ 2.\nThe weight vector \u03bdj is defined as the eigenvector of Hj , i.e.,\nHj |\u03bdi = \u03bd j |\u03bdi.\n\n(A.3)\n\nWe have N weight vectors in the fundamental representation N (N-dimensional irreducible representation of SU(N)) given by\n\u03bd1\n\u03bd2\n\u03bd\n\n3\n\n..\n.\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n1 1\n1\n1\n\uf8f8,\n= \uf8ed , \u221a ,*** , q\n,*** , q\n2 2 3\n2m(m + 1)\n2(N \u2212 1)N\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n1\n1 1\n1\n\uf8f8,\n,*** , q\n= \uf8ed\u2212 , \u221a , * * * , q\n2 2 3\n2m(m + 1)\n2(N \u2212 1)N\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n1\n1\n1\n\uf8f8,\n= \uf8ed0, \u2212 \u221a , \u221a , * * * , q\n3 2 6\n2(N \u2212 1)N\n\uf8eb\n\nm\n\n1\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8,\n\u03bd m+1 = \uf8ed0, 0, * * * , 0, \u2212 q\n,*** , q\n2m(m + 1)\n2(N \u2212 1)N\n..\n.\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u2212N\n+\n1\n\uf8f8.\n\u03bd N = \uf8ed0, 0, * * * , 0, q\n2(N \u2212 1)N\n\n(A.4)\n\nAll the weight vectors have the same length, and the angles between different weights\nare the same:\nN \u22121\n1\n\u03bdi * \u03bdi =\n. \u03bdi * \u03bdj = \u2212\n.

Nonorthogonal roots are only obtained when \u03b11 is included in the linear\ncombinations. It is not difficult to show that the total number of non-orthogonal roots\nis 2(N \u2212 1), and hence there are N(N \u2212 1) \u2212 2(N \u2212 1) = (N \u2212 2)(N \u2212 1) orthogonal\nroots. The (N \u2212 2)(N \u2212 1) shift operators E\u03b1 corresponding to these orthogonal roots\ntogether with the N \u2212 1 diagonal generators of the Cartan subalgebra Hk constitute\nthe maximal stability subgroup H\u0303 = U(N \u2212 1), since (N \u2212 2)(N \u2212 1) + (N \u2212 1) =\n43\n\n\f(N \u2212 1)2 = dimU(N \u2212 1).
