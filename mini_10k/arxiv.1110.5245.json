In practice, in isolated systems\nand for long times, macroscopic observables which involve the averages over many particles can be calculated equally accurately starting from thermodynamic considerations. The 'thermalization' of macroscopic\nsystems is one of the building principles of statistical mechanics. According to statistical mechanics, expectation values for macroscopic observables should, for long times, become independent of time and,\nmoreover, become equal to their statistical average; for a recent example of the relaxation of classical particles in a one-dimensional box, see Ref. [1]. The 'thermalization principle' equally applies to quantum\nmechanics where the Schr\u00f6dinger equation describes the deterministic evolution of a given initial state in\ntime. Recently, the question under which conditions thermalization is possible in closed quantum systems\nhas also been studied, both experimentally and theoretically [2\u20134]. According to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, each generic state of a closed quantum system already contains a thermal state which\nis revealed during unitary time evolution due to dephasing and relaxation processes. However, proofs for\nthis hypothesis have so far only been obtained in very specific settings [5, 6]; its applicability for generic\nquantum systems remains a matter of current research.\nIn this work, we are interested in the quantum-mechanical injection of particles into a chain. For this\ntoy model we can study the approach to a steady state analytically and numerically. The time evolution\nof prepared initial states in one-dimensional quantum systems such as our toy model can be studied experimentally using cold atomic gases on optical lattices confined to one dimensional potentials [2, 3, 7, 8].\nThese systems are to a very high degree isolated from the environment and are therefore ideally suited to\nstudy non-equilibrium dynamics in closed quantum systems. Besides the Hermitian time evolution we also\naddress the non-Hermitian case for our toy model where the chain particles cannot return to the bath sites\n\u2217\n\nCorresponding author\n\nE-mail: florian.gebhard@physik.uni-marburg.de, Phone: +49 6421 282 1318, Fax: +49 6421 282 4511\nCopyright line will be provided by the publisher\n\n\f2\n\nF. Gebhard, K. zu M\u00fcnster, J. Ren, N. Sedlmayr, J. Sirker, and B. Ziebarth: Particle injection into a chain\n\n(a 'quantum ratchet' [9, 10]). In general, effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians are naturally obtained if\none simulates a dissipative environment for a quantum model in the form of a Lindblad equation [11]. An\neffective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian has also been used to study the depinning of flux lines in superconductors [12]. Interesting from a fundamental point of view are, in particular, so-called pseudo-Hermitian\nHamiltonians-including Hamiltonians having PT -symmetry-which have real spectra and therefore offer a natural framework to extend standard quantum mechanics [13\u201315].\nIn Sect. 2 we recapitulate the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for time evolution in quantum mechanics. We treat\nboth cases of Hermitian and non-Hermitian Hamilton operators. In Sect. 3 we introduce our model system\nfor spinless fermions. We consider a chain of sites which is initially empty and is coupled to initially filled\nbath sites. At finite times, the hybridization introduces particles in the chain where they can move between\nneighboring sites. The hybridizations can be homogenous or inhomogeneous; in the latter case they induce\na transient current in the chain.\nIn Sect. 4 we discuss the particle density, the single-particle density matrix, and the current density for\nnon-interacting fermions. In the thermodynamic limit, the particle and current densities become constant\nfor large times because the contributions of individual modes interfere destructively ('decoherence'). The\noscillations in the single-particle density matrix on the other hand reveal the absence of relaxation for\nnon-interacting particles. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of the ratchet condition on the chain\ndynamics. In Sect. 5 we include a density-density interaction between the particles. We use the timedependent density-matrix renormalization group (t-DMRG) method to evolve the quantum-mechanical\nstates in time. The interaction between the particles induces a fast relaxation to stationary distributions for\nthe particle density, single-particle density matrix, and current. For our model system, with interactions of\nthe order of the bandwidth, we find that the relaxation time scale is two orders of magnitude shorter than\nthe time scale for dephasing.\nA summary and conclusions, Sect. 6 , close our presentation. Calculations for the asymmetric chain\nfilling in the ratchet case are deferred to appendix A.\n\n2\n\nHermitian and non-Hermitian time evolution\n\nWe begin our discussion with the Schr\u00f6dinger equation which defines the time evolution for Hermitian\nand non-Hermitian Hamilton operators. As in standard quantum mechanics, expectation values are to be\ntaken using the time-dependent wave function. The von-Neumann equation of motion of the corresponding\nstatistical operator can be cast into the general form of a Kossakowski\u2013Lindblad equation.\n2.1 Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nWe consider a finite-dimensional Hilbert space V. Its elements are the states |\u03c8i. We use the standard\nscalar product h\u03c6|\u03c8i \u2208 C where h\u03c6| is the shorthand notation for the linear functionals h\u03c6|*i which form\nthe dual space V\u2217 of our Hilbert space. For an operator \u00d4 which acts in V, its adjoint \u00d4\u2020 is defined by\nh\u03c6|\u00d4\u2020 |\u03c8i = h\u03c8|\u00d4|\u03c6i\u2217 for all h\u03c6| \u2208 V\u2217 and |\u03c8i \u2208 V where z \u2217 is the complex conjugate of z \u2208 C.\nFor time t \u2265 0, the time evolution of a state |\u03c8i and of its adjoint state h\u03c8| is given by\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n|\u03c8(t)i = exp \u2212i\u0124t |\u03c8i , h\u03c8(t)| = h\u03c8| exp i\u0124 \u2020 t ,\n(2.1)\nwhere \u0124 is a time-independent Hamilton operator and \u0124 \u2020 is its adjoint.\nIn the following we shall assume that the spectrum of \u0124 is real, i.e., the eigenstates of \u0124 obey\n\u0124|En i = En |En i\n\n(n = 1, 2, . . .)\n\n(2.2)\n\nwith En \u2208 R. As shown in Ref. [13] this implies that \u0124 is pseudo-Hermitian and \u0124 \u2020 has the same\nspectrum,\n(2.3)\n\u0124 \u2020 |En i = En |En i (n = 1, 2, . . .) .\nCopyright line will be provided by the publisher\n\n\fandp header will be provided by the publisher\n\n3\n\nEq. (2.3) implies that there is a left eigenvector hEn | of \u0124 for every right eigenvector |En i of \u0124 with the\nsame eigenvalue En .\n\u2020\nNote that hEn | = (|En i) only if \u0124 is Hermitian, \u0124 \u2020 = \u0124. The eigenstates of \u0124 and \u0124 \u2020 for different\nenergies are orthogonal hEn |Em i = 0 if En 6= Em .

It is important to note that the\ntime evolution described by (2.1) is not unitary so that the norm h\u03c8(t)|\u03c8(t)i is not conserved and must be\nconsidered separately.\nAs a consequence, the equation of motion for the statistical operator changes its form. The statistical\noperator for the pure state |\u03c8(t)i is defined by\n\u03c1\u0302(t) =\n\n|\u03c8(t)ih\u03c8(t)|\n.\nh\u03c8(t)|\u03c8(t)i\n\n(2.7)\n\nWith the help of the statistical operator, expectation values can be expressed in the form\n\u0001\nh\u00d4i(t) = Tr \u03c1\u0302(t)\u00d4 .\n\n(2.8)\n\nwhere Tr denotes the trace which implies the sum over the expectation values of an orthonormal basis set.\nThe statistical operator obeys \u03c1\u0302\u2020 = \u03c1\u0302, \u03c1\u03022 = \u03c1\u0302 and Tr\u03c1\u0302 = 1.

To this end, we consider the average particle number, the single-particle density matrix, and the\ncurrent density in the chain, as functions of time.\nAt short times we expect a linear increase of the particle density in the chain because we start with\nall particles at the source sites. At later times, we shall see an oscillatory behavior of the particle density\nbecause of the coherent quantum-mechanical movement of the particles within and into the chain (and back\nonto the source sites for the Hermitian case). In the non-interacting case, a constant average occupation is\nreached only for long times because the two-level systems stay coherent for relatively long times so that\nthe oscillations in the particle density die out only slowly. Interactions dampen these oscillations strongly\nand also modify the value in the long-time limit considerably, see Sect. 5.\n\n4.1 Homogeneous chain filling\nWe begin with the translationally invariant case for non-interacting particles, \u03b3l,in = \u03b3in and \u03b3l,out = \u03b3out\nin eq. (3.2). For a homogeneous chain filling, the single-particle density matrix is diagonal and the current\ndensity is zero for all times.\nCopyright line will be provided by the publisher\n\n\f6\n\nF.

Even in the ratchet case, not all particles are injected into the chain at long times.\nOnly for \u03b3in \u2192 \u221e does the particle number in the chain approach unity, see eq. (4.19). In addition, one still\nobserves fluctuations so that the particle density in the chain is not a monotonically increasing function. The\nmotion of the fermions on the chain leads to Pauli blocking and to quantum-mechanical interference effects\nwhich result in the observed incomplete and oscillatory chain filling. In comparison with the Hermitian\ntime evolution it can be seen that in the ratchet case the quantum-mechanical fluctuations are smaller and\nthe chain filling is bigger for the same parameter \u03b3/J.\n\n0.1\n0.08\nnc 0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n0\n0\n0.6\n\n(a)\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\nnc 0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n0\n1\n0.8\nnc 0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n(b)\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n(c)\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nJt\nFig. 3 Particle density in the chain nc (t) for non-interacting fermions on a chain with L = 50 sites for (a) \u03b3in /J =\n0.1, (b) \u03b3in /J = 1, and (c) \u03b3in /J = 10 (ratchet time evolution).

At small times all particles enter the chain at roughly the same moment which leads\nto a relatively flat distribution for Jt = 1. At larger times, the individual dynamics of each k-point\nbecomes visible and a lot of maxima and minima have developed already by Jt = 50. At very large times,\nJt = 5000, the map Ak,k (t), corresponding to a large collection of undamped oscillators, displays a nonmonotonic (\"chaotic\") distribution. The size of the fluctuations around the time-averaged distribution is as\nlarge as its mean. The system does not relax.\nThe corresponding results for the single-particle density matrix Ak,k for non-interacting electrons in the\nratchet case are shown in Fig. 5. The average distribution is sharply peaked at k = \u03c0/2, see eq. (4.18).\nThis means that for large times the k-points near \u03c0/2 show very little variation with time while the k-points\naway from \u03c0/2 are still strongly oscillating in time.\nCopyright line will be provided by the publisher\n\n\fandp header will be provided by the publisher\n\n9\n1\n\n1\nJt=50\n\n0.8\n\nJt=10\n\n0.6\n\nJt=1\n\nAk,k(t)\n\nAk,k(t)\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n0.2\n\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n0.6\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nk/\u03c0\n\nk/\u03c0\n\nFig. 4 Density matrix Ak,k (t) in the Hermitian time evolution with \u03b3/J = 1 for a chain of length L = 1000 as a\nfunction of the discrete momenta k = \u03c0n/(L + 1) for times Jt = 1, 10, 50 (left) and Jt = 5000 (right) where the\nsolid line is the long-time mean.\n1\n\n1\nJt=50\nJt=10\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nAk,k(t)\n\nAk,k(t)\n\n0.8\n\nJt=1\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n0.2\n\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n0.6\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n1\n\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nk/\u03c0\n\nk/\u03c0\n\nFig. 5 Density matrix Ak,k (t) in the ratchet case with \u03b3in /J = 1 for a chain of length L = 1000 as a function of the\ndiscrete momenta k = \u03c0n/(L + 1) for times Jt = 1, 10, 50 (left) and Jt = 5000 (right) where the solid line is the\nlong-time mean.\n\n4.1.2 Ratchet case\nHere we provide the analytical expressions on which the data in Figs. 3 and 5 are based.

Due to the motion of\nthe particles on the chain, some bath particles are prevented from falling down into the chain because their\nchain sites are blocked by other particles (Pauli exclusion principle).\n4.2 Inhomogeneous chain filling\nFor an inhomogeneous coupling, the problem must be treated numerically. It involves the diagonalization\nof the Hamiltonian (Hermitian time evolution) or the inversion of the self-energy matrix (ratchet case).\n4.2.1 Hermitian time evolution\nWe rewrite the Hamilton operator as\n\u0124 =\n\n2L\nX\n\nHi,j p\u0302\u2020i p\u0302j\n\n(4.20)\n\ni,j=1\n\nwith p\u03022m\u22121 = \u015dm , p\u03022m = \u0109m for m = 1, 2, . . . , L and H2m\u22121,2m = H2m,2m\u22121 = \u03b3m , H2m+2,2m =\nH2m,2m+2 = \u2212J for m = 1, 2, . . . , L \u2212 1.

The calculation of Ap,q (t) involves five lattice summations which are\nperformed numerically.\nFor an inhomogeneous coupling, \u03b3l = J exp(\u2212l/L), the particle-density in the chain nc (t) is qualitatively similar to the case of a symmetric filling for \u03b3 = J. In Fig. 6, we show the filling of the chain for\nthe unitary time evolution and the ratchet case for times Jt \u2264 100.\n0.45\n\n0.45\nL=200\nL=1000\n\n0.4\n\nL=200\nL=1000\n\n0.4\n\n0.35\n\n0.35\n\nnc\n\nnc\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.25\n\n0.25\n\n0.2\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\nJt\n\n80\n\n100\n\n0.2\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nJt\n\nFig. 6 Particle density in the chain nc (t) for non-interacting fermions with hopping \u03b3l = J exp(\u2212l/L) on a chain\nwith L = 200 (L = 1000) sites for unitary time evolution (left) and ratchet time evolution (right).\n\nIn the unitary case, the fluctuations in the particle density are much smaller for the inhomogeneous\nhybridizations than for constant hybridizations. In addition, larger system sizes reduce the fluctuations\nfurther as can be seen from the comparison for system sizes L = 200 and L = 1000. In any case the\nparticle density reaches its long-time value for times Jt & 1000 with small fluctuations around it. These\nreflect the transient current density in the system, see Fig. 8. In the ratchet case, we observe that the particle\ndensity in the long-time limit for the same set of parameters is higher than in the unitary case. Furthermore,\nthe oscillations around this long-time mean are more regular and decay algebraically.\nIn the case of an inhomogeneous coupling, \u03b3l = J exp(\u2212l/L), the single-particle density matrix is no\nlonger diagonal. The solution of the equations (4.23) and (4.29) for L = 200 sites shows that dephasing\nis very efficient for the non-diagonal elements Ak,p6=k . Even at short times, Jt \u223c 1, the single-particle\ndensity matrix is almost diagonal with Ak,p6=k (t) being an order of magnitude smaller than Ak,k (t) for all\nk, p. Further decay in time of the off-diagonal elements is only algebraic thus leading to an algebraically\ndecaying current density, see the following discussion. In Fig. 7 we show the time evolution of the diagonal\ncomponents of the single-particle density matrix, Ak,k (t). The qualitative behavior of Ak,k (t) is the same\nfor the homogenous and the inhomogeneous coupling. Note that the different chain fillings for the same\nparameter set lead to a different overall scale for Ak,k . The comparison shows that the frequency and the\nsize of the beating oscillations is smaller in the Hermitian time evolution than in the ratchet case. For an\ninhomogeneous hybridization, k is no longer a good quantum number. Apparently, the mode coupling in\nthe Hermitian case noticeably reduces the fluctuations of Ak,k (t) around its time average. In the ratchet\ncase, the Hamiltonian can still be written as a sum over commuting k-modes, see eq. (4.24). Therefore,\nwe observe a pronounced beating in Ak,k (t) even for inhomogeneous hybridizations. As we shall see in\nCopyright line will be provided by the publisher\n\n\fF.

A small transient current sets in at t > 0 and decays to zero for long times Jt \u226b 1. For our case study we choose\n\u03b3l = J exp(\u2212l/L) so that we insert particles more readily in the left part of the chain than in the right.\nOriginally, there is a current from the left to the right of the chain (jc > 0) which is reflected at the right\nchain end so that jc (t) changes sign as a function of time. As for the particle density, the current density\nshows oscillations which decay algebraically.\nIn Fig. 8 we show the transient current density for the Hermitian time evolution and the ratchet case\nfor L = 200 sites. The amplitudes differ for the same parameter set which is mostly due to the fact\nthat there are more particles in the chain for the ratchet case. The frequency of the current oscillations\nis comparable. The current oscillations correspond to a swapping of the particles between the right and\nleft chain boundaries. Since the mobile particles are concentrated around \u03b5(k0 ) = 0 (k0 = \u03c0/2), their\ndominant velocity is given by v0 = (\u2202\u03b5(k))/(\u2202k)|k=k0 = 2. Therefore, their travel time between the\nchain boundaries is T /2 \u2248 L/v0 = L/2 so that the oscillation period is T \u2248 L. As seen in Fig. 8,\nthis rule applies better for the ratchet case where the distribution Ak,p (t) is more peaked around (k, p) =\n(\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2).\n\n0.05\n\nunitary\nnon-unitary\n\njc\n0\n\n-0.05\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\nJt\n\nFig. 8 Current density jc (t) for non-interacting electrons for \u03b3l = J exp(\u2212l/L), unitary and non-unitary time\nevolution, for L = 200 sites.\n\nCopyright line will be provided by the publisher\n\n\fandp header will be provided by the publisher\n\n13\n\n4.2.2 Ratchet case\nHere we derive the formulae on which the data in Figs. 6, 7 and 8 are based.

This is obtained from the solution of the\nmatrix equation\n\u03a3 = \u2212(1 + f * H)\u22121 f .\n(4.29)\nHere, the entries of the matrices 1, H and f are 1a,b = \u03b4a,b (unit matrix), Ha,b = H(a, b) (commutator\nmatrix) and fa,b = \u03b4a,b fa , fa = |ga |2 (diagonal vertex matrix). The numerical solution requires the\ninversion of an L \u00d7 L matrix.\n\n5\n\nInteracting fermions\n\nIn the thermodynamic limit and for non-interacting electrons, the average particle number in the chain goes\nto a constant at long-times only due to decoherence. On the other hand, a true relaxation of the particle\ndensity and other physical quantities can only take place when interactions are included.\nTo investigate the model with the density-density interaction terms, eq. (3.3), included, we use an adaptive time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (t-DMRG) algorithm. In DMRG the wave function of the problem under consideration is approximated by a matrix-product state in a truncated Hilbert\nCopyright line will be provided by the publisher\n\n\f14\n\nF. Gebhard, K. zu M\u00fcnster, J. Ren, N. Sedlmayr, J. Sirker, and B. Ziebarth: Particle injection into a chain\n\nspace. The time evolution of this state is then calculated by using a second-order Trotter-Suzuki decomposition of the time-evolution operator. For details of the algorithm the reader is referred to Refs. [18, 19].\nIn our calculations we use a Trotter slicing \u03b4t = 0.1 and keep \u03c7 = 250 states. It is known that the matrix\ndimension necessary to represent faithfully the time-evolved state increases exponentially with time. The\nt-DMRG algorithm is therefore only capable of describing the time evolution at short and intermediate\ntimes.\n5.1 Particle number in the chain\nIn order to test the algorithm and the limitations for the time evolution, we perform numerical calculations\nfor the particle density of non-interacting fermions with a homogeneous coupling where analytical results\nare available, see Sect. 4.1. In Fig. 9 we compare numerical results obtained with the t-DMRG algorithm\nwith exact results in the non-interacting case, both for the unitary and ratchet time evolution. As seen\nfrom the figure, the t-DMRG results (\u03c7 = 250 states kept) are reliable for times Jt \u223c 14 (Jt \u223c 8) in the\nHermitian (ratchet) time evolution.\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\nnc\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n0\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\nnc\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n0\n\n(a)\n\n10\n\n5\n\n20\n\n15\n\n(b)\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nJt\nFig. 9 Particle density in the chain nc (t) for non-interacting fermions on a chain with L = 50 sites (a) for the\nHermitian time evolution (\u03b3/J = 1) and (b) for the ratchet time evolution (\u03b3in /J = 1). Full lines: analytical result;\ndots: data from t-DMRG (\u03c7 = 250 states kept).\n\nApparently, the t-DMRG is not able to reach the limit of large times when the two-level systems will\nhave dephased completely. However, the algebraic decay of the phase coherence in nc (t) as given in\neq. (4.13) and as shown in Fig. 2 is special to non-interacting fermions. Interactions between the particles\nlead to a much faster dephasing and, moreover, to a true relaxation. In Fig. 10 we show examples for the\nparticle density in the chain for the Hermitian time evolution (\u03b3/J = 1) in the presence of various types\nand strengths of the density-density interaction. In all cases, the interactions damp the oscillations and the\naverage particle number reaches its limiting value much faster.\nDepending on the type of interactions present, the energy of the system in its initial state\nEini = h\u03a80 |H|\u03a80 i\n\n(5.1)\n\nis different. Since the Hamiltonian is a conserved quantity, the energy cannot change during time evolution.\nIn the case where Vs = 0 (Fig. 10a) the system starts in a state with Eini = 0. Another state with zero\npotential energy for this type of density-density interactions is the twofold degenerate charge ordered state\nwhere chain and source sites are occupied alternatingly (Wigner lattice).

At least in the limit where Vc = Vcs is large, i.e., where the potential energy dominates over\nthe kinetic energy, we therefore expect the system to reach a stationary state which is close to this charge\nordered state. Therefore, the average particle density approaches nc (Jt \u226b 1) = 1/2 (see Fig. 10a) for\nlarge interactions which is larger than in the non-interacting case. Apparently, the Coulomb interaction\nreduces the degree of delocalization of electrons on the chain whereby the Pauli blocking becomes less\neffective. The reduction of the Pauli pressure increases the density of fermions in the chain.\nThe case Vc = Vcs = 0 with Vs 6= 0 (Fig. 10b) has an energy Eini = (L \u2212 1)Vs . For the situation\nwhere Vs is smaller than the bandwidth, energy conservation can be fulfilled by compensating the loss of\npotential energy by kinetic energy which the fermions gain by entering the chain. Numerically we find\nthat the density of these almost free fermions in the chain can reach nc (Jt \u226b 1) \u2248 1/2, see Fig. 10b. For\nVc = Vcs = 0 with Vs larger than the bandwidth, on the other hand, there is no possibility of compensating\nthe loss in potential energy with kinetic energy in the chain. Hence the particles are almost all confined to\nthe bath sites by energy conservation and nc (Jt \u226b 1) remains small, see Fig. 10b.\n\nFig. 11 Charge ordering in a Wigner crystal state. The crosses mark the occupied sites.\n\nThe fast damping of the oscillations of the particle density is a genuine interaction effect which does\nnot depend on the formation of a charge-density wave. This can be seen in Fig. 12 where we show the\ntime evolution of the particle density in the chain for Vs = Vc = Vcs = 1, 2, 3, 4 and \u03b3 = J = 1. As\nfor Vc = Vcs = 0, Vs 6= 0, due to the large initial energy, Eini = (L \u2212 1)Vs , of the system the number\nof accessible states is severely restricted. Therefore larger interactions, V \u2265 3, not only lead to a faster\nrelaxation but also suppress the particle density in the chain.\nCopyright line will be provided by the publisher\n\n\f16\n\nF.

In general,\nthe system can tunnel between these two possible states. For a large system size, however, the probability\nof all particles coherently tunneling is very small and therefore the associated timescale is very long. If\nwe reduce the system size to L = 2, on the other hand, the oscillations between these states occur on a\nrelatively short timescale as can be seen in Fig. 13.

In the interacting case, scattering processes between fermions provide an efficient\nmechanism for the relaxation of the single-particle density matrix. Therefore, we expect that Ak,k (Jt \u226b 1)\nbecomes independent of time. Note, however, that this distribution may, but need not, correspond to a\nthermal distribution for an appropriately chosen ensemble at a temperature determined by h\u0124ithermal \u2261\nh\u0124iinitial . The interesting question whether or not this thermal state is reached will be addressed in a\nforthcoming publication [20].\nIn Fig. 15 we show results for interaction parameters Vc = Vcs = 2, Vs = 0 and Vc = Vcs = 0,\nVs = 2.

At longer times, the interactions lead to a rapid damping of\nthe oscillations and, already at Jt = 10, the distribution in both cases becomes almost time-independent.\nFor Vc = Vcs = 2, Vs = 0 the distribution is very flat Ak,k (t \u226b 1) \u2243 1/2. This observation supports\nour interpretation of the data shown in Fig. 10a: for strong interactions, the fermions tend to form a\nWigner lattice of alternatingly occupied chain and source sites which corresponds to a completely flat\nsingle-particle density matrix. For Vc = Vcs = 0, Vs = 2, on the other hand, the distribution at long\ntimes resembles more a thermal Fermi distribution. Here the loss of potential energy due to particles\nleaving the bath has to be compensated by a gain in kinetic energy. For the interaction strength considered,\napproximately half of the particles enter the chain in the long-time limit, see Fig. 10b.

Despite the fact that our t-DMRG cannot go much beyond Jt = 10, our data suggest that\nthe electron-electron interactions lead to a fast relaxation of the single-particle density matrix to its value\nin the long-time limit.\n5.3 Current density\nFor non-interacting particles, the current decays to zero algebraically in time. The reason is the dephasing\nof the k-modes. In the presence of interactions, the current not only dephases but decays (exponentially)\nquickly. In Fig. 16 we show the result for the Hermitian time evolution for L = 50 sites and two sets of\ninteraction parameters. The fast decay of the current is clearly observed.\n\n0.04\n\n0.03\n\njc 0.02\n0.01\n\n0\n0\n\n10\n\n5\n\n15\n\nJt\nFig. 16 Current density jc (t) for interacting electrons for \u03b3l = J exp(\u2212l/L) in the Hermitian time evolution (J = 1)\nfor L = 50 sites with Vc = Vcs = 2, Vs = 0 (circles) and Vc = Vcs = 4, Vs = 0 (squares). For comparison we also\nshow the result for noninteracting fermions (full line).\n\nAs discussed in Sect. 4.2, the inhomogeneous injection of non-interacting fermions results in a swapping\nof particles between the chain boundaries. As seen in Fig. 8, the current density increases to a maximal\nnon\u2212int\nvalue of jc,max\n\u2248 0.1 at Jt \u2248 50, oscillates with period T \u2248 L, and decays to zero algebraically\nint\nslowly. For interacting fermions, however, the current density reaches its maximum of jc,max\n\u2248 0.02 at\nJt \u2248 5, and rapidly decays to very small values already at Jt \u2248 10. Apparently, the interactions prevent\nthe buildup of a coherent mesoscopic particle wave package, and only local transient current fluctuations\ncan be seen. Note that this effect is most prominent in one dimension where particles can scatter forward\nand backward only. In addition, we have chosen quite sizable interactions to make the rapid relaxation\nvisible within our restricted time interval in t-DMRG. For a more detailed analysis, longer times must be\nstudied. This is beyond our numerical capabilities.\n\n6\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nIn this work, we studied the injection of spinless fermions from filled reservoir sites into an empty chain\non which the particles can move between neighboring sites. We treated the cases of homogeneous and\nCopyright line will be provided by the publisher\n\n\fandp header will be provided by the publisher\n\n19\n\ninhomogeneous hybridizations between the source and chain sites under a Hermitian time evolution and\nfor the quantum ratchet case where the chain particles cannot return to the source sites. For non-interacting\nelectrons, we provide analytical expressions as a function of time for the particle density, the single-particle\ndensity matrix, and the current density. In the presence of interactions, we use the t-DMRG algorithm to\ndescribe the time evolution of observables for short to medium time scales.\nThe Hermitian time evolution and the ratchet time evolution both show some qualitatively similar effects\nwhich is quite surprising at first. Despite the fact that the particles cannot return from the chain to the source\nsites in the ratchet case, their injection remains a coherent quantum-mechanical process. Therefore, the\nwell-known quantum-mechanical phenomena such as constructive and destructive interference and Pauli\nblocking are seen in our observables. In particular, there are in both cases oscillations around the longtime average of the chain filling. Naturally, the results differ quantitatively. For example, the chain filling\n(transient current) is larger (smaller) for the ratchet case than for the Hermitian case for the same parameter\nset.\nThe time evolution of non-interacting particles is characterized by the absence of relaxation so that\nfairly large dephasing times, Jt > 103 , dominate the time evolution of our quantities. For large systems,\nthe dephasing ultimately leads to steady-state expressions for the particle and current densities but the\nsingle-particle density matrix reveals that the spectrum is that of a single-particle Hamiltonian. For a homogeneous coupling, the system consists of independent two-level systems and the single-particle density\nmatrix reflects the beating of these two-level systems. For inhomogeneous hybridizations, the beating of\nthe diagonal terms Ak,k (t) is less pronounced because k is no longer a good quantum number. The inhomogeneous coupling between chain and source sites generates non-diagonal elements in the single-particle\ndensity matrix which, however, are small and dephase in time. They give rise to the coherent motion of\na spreading particle wave packet between the chain ends which results in a transient oscillating current\ndensity.\nWhen we introduce substantial interactions between the particles, the picture changes qualitatively.\nDepending on the type of density-density interactions considered, the system starts with different initial\nenergies. Since the energy is conserved during time evolution, only parts of the Hilbert space are accessible. Interactions can therefore increase or decrease the particle density in the chain compared to the\nnon-interacting case. Furthermore, the single-particle density matrix in the long-time limit can show a\ncompletely flat distribution in cases where the potential energy dominates, or become similar to a thermalized free fermion distribution when the kinetic energy plays the dominant role. Most importantly, instead of\na slow dephasing or beating phenomena, we observe a rapid relaxation to stationary values on time scales\nJt = 10, not only for the particle and current densities but also for the single-particle density matrix. This\nshows the importance of interactions for a fast relaxation for all physical quantities of interest. In how far\nthe obtained time-independent results do coincide with those predicted by thermodynamic considerations\nis a question we are planning to address in more detail elsewhere [20].\nAcknowledgements J.S. acknowledges support by the MAINZ (MATCOR) school of excellence and the DFG via\nthe SFB/Transregio 49.\n\nA\n\nSingle-particle density matrix for non-interacting fermions (inhomogeneous ratchet case)\n\nA.1 State\nAs seen from eq.
