In common with conventional DGLAP parton\ndistribution functions, GPDs cannot be calculated from\nfirst principles at present due to the confinement problem, but they can be pinned down through a global RGE\nanalysis of all available experimental data. The simplest\nexample of such a hard, exclusive, diffractive process is\ndeeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) [1,2,5,6], for\nwhich there is recent first data available from HERA [7,8],\nHERMES [9] and JLAB [10].\nThe RGE for the GPDs involve kernels which have\nbeen computed up to next-to-leading order (NLO) in perturbation theory so far [11]. The solutions of these NLO\nevolution equations are necessary to obtain accurate predictions for various experimentally accessible processes.\nIn fact the DVCS amplitude itself can be directly accessed experimentally through the interference of DVCS\nwith the Bethe-Heitler process [7\u20139]. In this paper we\npresent numerical solutions to the NLO QCD evolution\nof the GPDs for large (HERMES) and small (HERA)\nskewedness which corresponds to large and small Bjorken\nx in the particular representation used. As input for the\nNLO evolution, we use a model based on double distributions (DDs) [12,13] incorporating for comparison two related sets of conventional NLO unpolarized and polarized\n\u2032\nparton distribution functions (PDFs), MRSA [14] and\nGehrmann-Stirling ('GS(A)') [15], and GRV98 [16] and\nGRSV00 [17], respectively. The resultant input GPDs,\nby design, respect all the known symmetries and properties of the GPDs, which are preserved under evolution.\nThis latter condition constitutes a stringent test of any\nproposed solutions, which is passed by our numerical solutions to very good accuracy.\nThis paper presents the first results of the numerical\nsolution to the RGEs at NLO accuracy [18\u201320] for any x\n(see, e.g., [21,22] for leading order skewed evolution) and\nis organised as follows. In section II we give the formal\ndefinitions of the GPDs and discuss their symmetry and\nspectral properties. Section III describes our choice of input distributions to the evolution equations outlined in\nsection IV. We present our numerical results, including\na comparison between leading order and next-to-leading\norder skewed evolution and a comparison with conventional next-to-leading order evolution, in section V, and\nconclude in section VI. Our evolution code will be made\navailable to the community in the near future via the\ninternet [23].\n\nThe QCD evolution of both unpolarized and polarized generalized parton distributions (GPDs) to next-to-leading order\n(NLO) accuracy is presented, in both the DGLAP and ERBL\nregions, for two appropriately symmetrized input distributions based on conventional parton density functions. To illustrate the relative size of the NLO corrections a comparison\nis made with leading order evolution of the same distributions. For the first time, NLO results are given for both small\nand large values of the skewedness parameter, \u03b6 = xbj , i.e. for\nall of the kinematic range relevant to HERA and HERMES.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nGeneralized Partons Distributions (GPDs) [1\u20134] are\ngeneric two-parton correlation functions of nucleons that\nprovide the boundary conditions for the calculation of\nvarious hard, exclusive, diffractive processes in QCD. For\nsuch processes, which are characterised by a suitable hard\nscale (for example a large photon virtuality, Q2 , in Deep\nInelastic Scattering (DIS) experiments), the incoming nucleon remains intact and at high energies is well separated\nin rapidity from the rest of the final state, i. e. the diffractively produced low mass particle (e.g. a meson or real\nphoton). A perturbative QCD analysis is possible provided that a factorization theorem is proved which illustrates the separation of short and long distance physics.\nThe QCD amplitude is then a sum of terms involving a\nconvolution of a hard scattering coefficient (calculated to\na given order in \u03b1s ) with a GPD (specified to a related\naccuracy in logarithms) and possibly a second convolution with a distribution amplitude, in the case of the\nproduction of a hadronic final state.\nThe universal, non-perturbative GPDs obey renormalization group equations (RGE) and are formally defined,\nup to power suppressed contributions, by Fourier transforms of non-local, renormalized, light-cone operators\nsandwiched between nucleon states of unequal momentum (the corresponding distributions in inclusive DIS involve equal momenta for the incoming and outgoing nu-\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nandreas.freund@physik.uni-regensburg.de\nmartinmc@amtp.liv.ac.uk\n\n1\n\n\fand r * z [1,3,24] as follows:\n\nII. DEFINITIONS, SYMMETRIES AND\nSPECTRAL REPRESENTATIONS OF GPDS\n\nAmplitudes for quark and gluon correlators of unequal\nmomentum nucleon states may be defined in a number of\nways. We choose a definition which treats the initial and\nfinal state nucleon momentum (p, p\u2032 , respectively) symmetrically by involving parton light-cone fractions with\nrespect to the momentum transfer, r = p \u2212 p\u2032 , and the\naverage momentum, P\u0304 = (p + p\u2032 )/2.

Note that in accordance with the associated Lorentz structures, the F 's\ncorrespond to helicity non-flip and the K's to helicity flip\namplitudes, and are collectively known as double distributions. Henceforth, for brevity, we shall only discuss\nthe helicity non-flip piece explicitly. However, the helicity flip case is exactly analogous. The D-terms in the last\ntwo lines permit non-zero values for the singlet M S and\nM G in the limit P\u0304 * z \u2192 0 and r * z 6= 0, which is allowed\nby their evenness in P\u0304 * z (cf. eq.(2)). Conversely, M N S\nis required by its oddness under P\u0304 * z, for any r * z, to be\nzero [24].\nBy making a particular choice of the light-cone vector, z \u03bc , as a light-ray vector (so that in light-cone variables, z\u00b1 = z0 \u00b1 z3 , only its minus component is non-zero\nz \u03bc = (0, z\u2212 , 0)) one may reduce the double spectral representation of eq.(4), defined on the entire light-cone, to\na one dimensional spectral representation, defined along\na light ray, depending on the skewedness parameter, \u03be,\ndefined by\n\n(1)\n\nM N S (P\u0304 * z, r * z) = \u2212M N S (\u2212P\u0304 * z, \u2212r * z)\n(2)\n\n\u03be = r * z/2P\u0304 * z = r+ /2P\u0304+ .\n\nThe opposite properties are observed for the polarized\ncase. Hermitian conjugation gives for all polarized and\nunpolarized species (i = S, N S, G)\nM i (P\u0304 * z, r * z) = M i (P\u0304 * z, \u2212r * z) .\n\nZ\n\ndxe\u2212ixP\u0304 *z\n\n\u22121\n\n\u0014\n\nwhere P+,\u2212 = P\u0304 \u00b1 2r , t = r2 is the four-momentum transfer, \u1e91 = \u03b3 \u03bc z\u03bc , P\u0304 * z and r * z are dimensionless Lorentz\nscalars, a = u, d, s, c... is a flavour index and the symbol\nP represents the usual path ordered exponential.

The unpolarized singlet and the\ngluon have additional resonance-like contributions called\nthe D-term [24,25] which ensures the correct symmetry\nand polynomiality properties (cf. eq.(4)). Note that the\nsymmetries which hold for the matrix elements change\nfor the H i s, due to the P\u0304 * z, \u1e91 factors in eq.(4). The\nunpolarized quark singlet is antisymmetric about v = 0,\nwhereas the unpolarized quark non-singlet and the gluon\nare symmetric. The opposite symmetries hold for the\npolarized distributions. The helicity flip GPDs, (labelled\nwith Es), are found analogously (double integrals with\nrespect to the Ks).\nHenceforth, we shall make the usual assumption that\nthe t-dependence of all of these functions factorizes into\nimplicit form factors. One should bear in mind that in\norder to make predictions for physical amplitudes (for\nt 6= 0) these form factors must be specified. Note that\nthe assumption of a factorized t-dependence, as a general\nstatement, must be justified within the kinematic regime\nconcerned. It appears to be valid at small x and small t,\nfrom the HERA data on a variety of diffractive measurements. However, it appears to be wrong for moderate\nto large t and larger x [26]. The evolution used in this\nnote assumes the same factorized t-dependence for each\nparton species, which therefore factorizes in the evolution equations. Thus any effect of assuming a different\nt-dependence for quark singlet and gluon, which mix under evolution, is neglected (but could in principle be investigated within the same framework). The effect on\nevolution of relaxing the assumption of factorization of\nthe t-dependence altogether remains an open question.\nTaking the N \u2212 1 moments (for even N ) of the GPDs\nyields a sum of polynomials in the skewedness parameter\n\u03be [24]:\nZ 1\ndvv N \u22121 H(v, \u03be, t) =\n\nwhere v1 \u2208 [\u2212\u03be, 1], v2 \u2208 [\u22121, \u03be] (see fig.(4) of [22]),\n\u03b6 \u2261 r+ /p+ is the skewedness defined on the domain\n\u03b6 \u2208 [0, 1] such that \u03be = \u03b6/(2 \u2212 \u03b6) and \u03b6 = xbj for DVCS,\nup to terms of O(xbj t/Q2 ).

In the DGLAP\n[27] region, X > \u03b6 (|v| > \u03be), F q (X, \u03b6) and F q\u0304 (X, \u03b6)\nare independent functions, corresponding to quark or\nanti-quark fields leaving the nucleon with momentum\nfraction X and returning with positive momentum fraction X \u2212 \u03b6. As such they correspond to a generalization of regular DGLAP PDFs (which have equal outgoing and returning fractions). In the ERBL [28] region,\nX < \u03b6 (|v| < \u03be), both quark and anti-quark carry positive momentum fractions (X, \u03b6 \u2212 X) away from the nucleon in a meson-like configuration, and the GPDs behave\nlike ERBL [28] distributional amplitudes characterising\nmesons. This implies that F q and F q\u0304 are not independent in the ERBL region, indeed a symmetry is observed:\nF q (\u03b6 \u2212 X, \u03b6) = F q\u0304 (X, \u03b6) (which directly reflects the symmetry of H q (v, \u03be) about v = 0). Similarly, the gluon\ndistribution, F g , is DGLAP-like for X > \u03b6 and ERBLlike for X < \u03b6. This leads to unpolarized non-singlet,\nF N S,a = F q,a \u2212F q\u0304,a , and gluon GPDs which\nP are symmetric, and a singlet quark distribution F S = a F q,a +F q\u0304,a\nwhich is antisymmetric, about the point X = \u03b6/2 in the\nERBL region. Again the opposite symmetries hold for\nthe polarized distributions.\n\n1\u2212|x|\n\nF (x, y, t)xN \u2212k y k .\n\n(11)\n\nFor the gluon one may use either transformation, e.g.\n\n\u22121\n\nN\nX\n\nX1 \u2212 \u03b6/2\n\u03b6/2 \u2212 X2\n, v2 =\n.\n1 \u2212 \u03b6/2\n1 \u2212 \u03b6/2\n\n(8)\n\n\u22121+|x|\n\nThis powerful polynomiality condition arises because \u03bci\nindices of a local operator O\u03bc1 ...\u03bcN must be carried by\neither P\u0304 or r (taking moments is equivalent to going\nfrom non-local to local operators). In building models for\nGPDs, eq.(8) always has to be fulfilled and thus strongly\nconstrains any model for the GPDs. We incorporate it\nin a natural way in building our input distributions in\nsection III.\n\nIII. INPUT GPDS\n\nIn this section we describe how to build input distributions, F q,q\u0304,g (X, \u03b6, Q0 ), at the input scale, Q0 , with\n3\n\n\fFor the anti-quark, since v2 = \u2212v1 one may use\neqs.(10,13) with v2 , v1 \u2192 \u2212v1 , and exploiting the fact\nthat f q (x) = \u2212q\u0304(|x|) for x < 0, one arrives at\n\nthe correct symmetries and properties from conventional\nPDFs in the DGLAP region, for both the unpolarized\nand polarized cases. These input NDPDFs then serve as\nthe boundary conditions for our numerical evolution.\nFactoring out the overall t-dependence we have for the\nquark for example (v1 > \u2212\u03be):\n\nF q\u0304,a (X, \u03b6) =\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ \u2212v1\u2212\u03be\n1 +\u03be\n\u2212v1 \u2212 x\u2032\n2\ndx\u2032 \u03c0 q x\u2032 ,\nq\u0304 a (|x\u2032 |).\n1 \u2212\u03be\n\u03b6 \u2212v1+\u03be\n\u03be\n\nH q,a (v1 , \u03be)\n=\nF (X, \u03b6) =\n1 \u2212 \u03b6/2\nZ 1\nZ 1\u2212|x\u2032 |\nF q,a (x\u2032 , y \u2032 )\n\u2032\ndx\ndy \u2032 \u03b4 (x\u2032 + \u03bey \u2032 \u2212 v1 )\n.

We have explicitly checked\nthis forward limit for our input codes against independent codes for the conventional PDFs (see fig.(1) later).\nSo far, models for polarized distributions have been\nstrongly based, for reasons of consistency, on closely associated models for unpolarized distributions. For this\nreason we choose as our inputs these closely related pairs\nof models. Unfortunately, the polarized set of distributions of Gehrmann and Stirling ('GS(A)') [15] is rather\n\u2032\nold now and is based on the MRSA unpolarized set [14].\nOur other set is the very recent GRSV set from 2000 [17]\nwhich is based on the 1998 unpolarized model by GRV\n[16] (we will denote these GRSV00 and GRV98 respectively [30]).\nHaving defined this model for the double distribution\none may then perform the y \u2032 -integration in eq.(13) using\nthe delta function.

NLO EVOLUTION OF GPDS\n\nThe input GPDs, defined above, are continuous functions which span the DGLAP and ERBL regions, and\nevolve in scale appropriately according to the DGLAP or\nERBL evolution equations, given below. Note that the\nevolution in the ERBL region depends on the DGLAP\nregion (see eq. (25)) whereas the DGLAP evolution is independent of the ERBL region. One remarkable feature\nis that the evolved functions remain continuous under\nevolution and continue to satisfy all appropriate symmetries in the ERBL region. As can be seen, our numerical\nsolutions manifestly exhibit these properties (see Section\nV), thus making us confident in the correctness of our\nnumerical solutions.\nIn the DGLAP region the singlet and gluon distributions mix under evolution:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ 1\ny \u03b6\ndz\ndF S (y, \u03b6, Q2 )\nF S (z, \u03b6, Q2 )\n=\nP\n,\nqq\nd ln(Q2 )\nz\nz\nz\ny\n+\n\u0013Z 1\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\ny \u03b6\ndz\n\u03b6\nPqg\n,\nF G (z, \u03b6, Q2 ) ,\n+ 1\u2212\n2\nz z\ny z\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ 1\ndF G (y, \u03b6, Q2 )\ny \u03b6\ndz\nF G (z, \u03b6, Q2 )\n=\nP\n,\ngg\nd ln(Q2 )\nz\nz\nz\ny\n+\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ 1\n1\ny \u03b6\ndz\n+\nF S (z, \u03b6, Q2 ) ,\n(22)\nPgq\n,\nz z\n1 \u2212 2\u03b6 y z\n\nIn the ERBL region we have\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\ndF S (y, \u03b6, Q2 ) h 1 dz qq y z\n+\n=\nV\n,\nd ln(Q2 )\n\u03b6 \u03b6 +\ny \u03b6\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\nZ 1\nZ y\ndz qq y z i S\ndz qq y z\nF\n\u2213\nV\n,\nV\n,\n\u03b6\n\u03b6 \u03b6 +\n\u03b6\n\u03b6 \u03b6\n\u03b6\n0\n\u0012\n\u0013 Z\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03b6 h 1 dz qg y z\nV\n,\n+ 1\u2212\n2\n2\n\u03b6 \u03b6\ny \u03b6\n\u0013 Z 1\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\nZ y\ndz qg y z i G\ndz qg y z\n\u2213\nV\nV\n,\n,\nF ,\n\u2212\n2\n2\n\u03b6 \u03b6\n\u03b6 \u03b6\n\u03b6 \u03b6\n0 \u03b6\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\ndF G (y, \u03b6, Q2 ) h 1 dz gg y z\n+\n=\nV\n,\nd ln(Q2 )\n\u03b6 \u03b6 +\ny \u03b6\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\nZ 1\nZ y\ndz gg y z i G\ndz gg y z\n\u00b1\nF\nV\n,\nV\n,\n\u03b6\n\u03b6 \u03b6 +\n\u03b6\n\u03b6 \u03b6\n\u03b6\n0\n\u0012\n\u0013\nhZ 1\ny z\n1\ngq\n\u0011\ndzV\n,\n+\u0010\n\u03b6 \u03b6\ny\n1\u2212 \u03b6\n2\n\n\u2212\n\nZ\n\n0\n\ny\n\ndzV\n\ngq\n\n\u0012\n\ny z\n,\n\u03b6 \u03b6\n\n\u0013\n\n\u00b1\n\nZ\n\n\u03b6\n\n1\n\ndzV\n\ngq\n\n\u0012\n\ny z\n,\n\u03b6 \u03b6\n\n\u0013i\n\nFS ,\n\n(25)\n\nwith generalized ERBL kernels [11], where the bar notation means for example, z/\u03b6 = 1 \u2212 z/\u03b6.

The quark singlet\nis scaled by a factor of 10\u22124 at \u03b6 = 0.0001 and by 10\u22122 at\n\u03b6 = 0.1. For \u03b6 = 0.1 the symmetry of the gluon GPD and the\nanti-symmetry of the singlet quark GPD are apparent about\nthe point X = \u03b6/2 = 0.05.\n\nIn fig.(1) we plot the ratio of our input gluon GPDs\nto the conventional input gluon PDFs on which they are\nbased, in the DGLAP region (X > \u03b6 = 0.0001). The\nforward limit F (X \u226b \u03b6, \u03b6, Q0 )/f (X, Q0 ) \u2192 1, built into\nour input model of eqs.(13, 14, 15) by design, is illustrated for each input PDF. In the region X \u2248 \u03b6, the un\u2032\npolarized distributions MRSA and GRV98 exhibit the\nfamiliar enhancement (of about 15 \u2212 20%) required by\npositivity constraints, F (X \u2248 \u03b6, \u03b6, Q0 )/f (X, Q0 ) > 1. In\ncontrast, the polarized input model shows a suppression\n(of about 35 \u2212 40%) in this region. We choose to plot results for the gluon since this is most relevant to small-x\nexclusive diffractive processes at HERA, for which it has\nbeen argued that the inclusion of skewedness (at least\nat LO in the unpolarized case) leads to an enhancement\n(see e.g. [21,22,33]).\nIn [21] it was demonstrated that LO skewed evolution\nin the unpolarized case yields a ratio consistently above\nunity with a strong enhancement near X = \u03b6 and a ratio\ntending to unity from above at large X \u226b \u03b6. This is\ndue to the probabilistic interpretation of the evolution\nat LO [34]. At NLO, this interpretation is lost in the\nunpolarized case [35] and thus the LO statement does not\nnecessarily apply, since perturbative quantities become\nscheme dependent in NLO.\n80\n2\n60\nFS(X,\u03b6,Q )\n40\n\u03b6=0.0001\n20\n0\n\u221220\n\u221240\n\u221260\n\u221280 \u22127\n\u22126\n\u22125\n10\n10\n10\n\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n\n10\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\n10\n\n\u22123\n\n0 \u22127\n10\n\nB.

However, on inspecting the ratio of the\nNLO gg and gq kernels for the GPDs to the NLO gg and\ngq kernels of the forward PDFs, one observes that even\nfor X \u226b \u03b6 they can be very different from one another\nover a broad range of X, but will eventually settle at\nunity. An enhancement due to skewed evolution is still\nseen at NLO , but only very close to X = \u03b6 (for both the\npolarized and unpolarized cases).\nIn the lower plot of fig.(2) we illustrate the polarized\ncase using the GS(A) polarized gluon. Again we see the\nratio drop progressively below unity for X > \u03b6.

The lower plots\nin figs.(3,4), with \u03b6 = 0.1, use a linear scale on the X axis,\nand hence illustrate very explicitly the symmetries in the\nERBL region about the point X = \u03b6/2 = 0.05 which are\nmanifestly preserved under evolution. These symmetries\nalso hold for the upper curves (for \u03b6 = 0.0001) but are\nless visible on a logarithmic scale. These features indicate\nthat our code is indeed correct and properly performs the\nNLO evolution in both the ERBL and DGLAP region.\nFrom fig.(3) and the upper plots of fig.(5) we note that\nboth unpolarised input sets (GRV98 and MRSA') produce similar results for the input and evolved GPDs.\nFrom fig.(4) and the lower left plot of fig.(5) we note\nwith particular interest the result for the NLO evolution\nof the polarized quark singlet at small \u03b6. The GS(A)\nset assumes a rather different sea content to GRSV00,\nin particular the former has a positive quark singlet at\nthe input scale and the latter a negative one. The NLO\nevolution keeps the GRSV00 distribution unchanged in\nshape, only altering its size, whereas the GS(A) distribution is driven towards the same shape as well as overall\nsign as the GRSV00 distribution. This seems to indicate\nthat the NLO generalised evolution favours the initial\nshape of the GRSV00 distribution and thus a negative\npolarized quark singlet at small \u03b6. At larger \u03b6, where the\nsea is of little numerical importance, the initial shapes\nare very similar and so one does not observe the same\ntype of effect for GS(A).\n\n0.10\n\n1\n\n0.00\n\n0.8\n\n\u22120.10\n\n0.6\n\n20\n\n0.5\n\nV\n\n2\n\nF S(X,\u03b6,Q )\n\u03b6=0.0001\n\n0.4\n\nV\n\n2\n\nF g(X,\u03b6,Q )\n\u03b6=0.0001\n\n15\n10\n\n0.3\n0.2\n\n5\n0.1\n0\n0.001\n\n\u22120.20\n\u22120.30\n\u22120.40\n0.001\n\n0\n0.1 0.001\n\n0.01\n\nA\n\n2\n\nF S(X,\u03b6,Q )\n\u03b6=0.0001\n0.01\n\nX\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\nA\n\n2\n\nF g(X,\u03b6,Q )\n\u03b6=0.0001\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0.001\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\nX\n\nFIG. 5.

The input parton sets for each curve are the same as\nthose given in Figs. 3 and 4. The quark singlet is scaled by\na factor of 10\u22124 in the unpolarised case and by 10\u22122 in the\npolarised case.\n\nAlthough similar in shape (except for the polarized\nquark singlet at the input), the two sets of polarised distributions differ considerably in size. The general evolution effects which push partons to smaller X with increasing Q2 , are naturally the same for both sets of inputs.\nIn order to quantify the relative effects of including\nNLO skewed kernels in detail, we also evolved the same\ninput GPDs using LO skewed kernels. In the upper and\nlower plots of fig.(6) we present the ratio of the evolved\nGPDs at NLO to those at LO, for the unpolarized and polarized cases, respectively. Overall the effect of including\nNLO corrections is at most a 25% effect, within the kinematic ranges illustrated. The regions furthest from unity\nin these ratio plots illustrate the ranges in X, relative\nto \u03b6, where the greatest effects are felt. The symmetry\nof the individual distributions about \u03b6/2 continue to be\nreflected in these ratio plots, which further indicates that\nthe NLO evolution slightly alters the shape of the distributions relative to LO, but in such a way as to preserve\nthe symmetries.\n\n8\n\n\f1.3\n1.2\n1.1\n1\n0.9\n0.8\nNLO/LO\n2\nRg\n(X,\u03b6,Q )\n0.7\n\u03b6 = 0.0001\n0.6\n0.5 \u22127\n\u22125\n\u22123\n10\n10\n10\n1.15\n\n1.25\n1.15\n1.05\n\n0.75 \u22127\n10\n1.15\n\n\u22121\n\n1.1\n\n1.05\n\n1.05\n1\n\n(X,\u03b6,Q )\n\n\u03b6 = 0.1\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.9\n\n\u22125\n\n10\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n2\n\nNLO/LO\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\nX\n\nX\n\n1.2\n\n1.20\n\n1.15\n\n1.15\n\n1.1\n\nC.

The solid and dashed-dotted curves shows the\nratio at Q = 5 GeV and Q = 10 GeV , respectively.\n\nRecall that in the definition of the unpolarized singlettype quark input GPDs we included an extra piece in the\nERBL region only, known as the D-term, which we modelled following [25] in eq.(21). This extra piece simply\nforms part of the definition of the input which is then\nevolved. In order to quantify its influence we consider\nin fig.(7) the ratio of the quark singlet with the D-term\nincluded to that with it omitted for various values of \u03b6.\nOne observes that its numerical influence becomes progressively less significant as \u03b6 decreases (at \u03b6 = 0.01 it is\nless than 1%).\n\nThe spikes in the antisymmetric unpolarized singlet\nquark and polarized gluon ratios result from a slight loss\nof numerical accuracy in a few bins around the point \u03b6/2\n(where the distributions have to pass through zero). The\neffect is magnified in this ratio. However, since the distributions vary by as much as twelve orders of magnitude\n(in the unpolarized quark singlet case), and the effect\noccurs close to a zero, this is not a cause for concern.\nThe cusps observed at X = \u03b6 are due to the fact that\nthe NLO over LO ratios approach the same value from\nthe ERBL and DGLAP region very rapidly around the\nX = \u03b6 region. This change in shape in NLO over LO,\nwhich could be seen more clearly if the region around\nthe X = \u03b6 were to be enlarged, is easily explained.

The original model specified a more general\nform for the profile functions:\n\nb=1 Q=2\nb=100 Q=2\nb=1, Q=10\nb=100, Q=10\n\n150\n100\n\n(27)\n\n2\n\nQuark Singlet GPD\n\nQuark Singlet GPD\n\n\u0393(2b + 2) [(1 \u2212 |x|)2 \u2212 y 2 ]b\n.\n\u03c0(x, y) = 2b+1 2\n2\n\u0393 (b + 1) (1 \u2212 |x|)2b+1\n\n3\n\n200\n\nb=1 Q=2\nb=100 Q=2\nb=1, Q=10\nb=100, Q=10\n\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n\n50\n0\n-50\n-100\n\n-3\n\nSo that eq.(14) corresponds to b = 1 for the quark and\nb = 2 for the gluon. It was suggested in [25] that variable b could be used as a fit parameter to extract GPDs\nfrom DVCS observables. It was also noted that the limit\nof very large b corresponds to the forward limit of \u03b6independent GPDs, for all X > \u03b6.\nWe have investigated this issue numerically and find\nthat in the DGLAP region the GPDs tend to the PDFs\nvery slowly as a function of b, particularly close to X = \u03b6.\nMeanwhile the behaviour of the GPDs in the ERBL region is seen to change dramatically. We illustrate this\nin fig. 8 at small and large \u03b6 (i.e. \u03b6 = 0.0001, 0.1, respectively), comparing b = 100 with the canonical values for both the quark singlet and gluon, using GRV98\nforward distributions. As can be seen, in the DGLAP\nregion (X > \u03b6) using such a large value of b has only a\nmarginal effect. In the ERBL region a rather dramatic\neffect is seen at the input scale, particularly close to the\nsymmetric point X = \u03b6/2. It is satisfying to observe\n(from the Q = 10 GeV curves) that under evolution both\nchoices appear to tend to similar evolved distributions (as\nthe memory of the details of the input distribution are\nwashed out by the skewed evolution). We may conclude\nfrom the figures that if parameter b is to be used as a\nfit parameter to constrain GPDs using data, it would require high statistics data on DVCS observables which are\nvery sensitive to the details of the real part of DVCS amplitudes in the ERBL region, such as the azimuthal angle\nasymmetry or the charge asymmetry (see e.g. [29]). We\nmay also conclude that taking the very large b limit of\nRadyushkin's ansatz is not a particularly good way of numerically probing models in which the GPD is the same\nas the PDF in the DGLAP region, since the convergence\nappears to be very slow.\n\n-150\n\n-4\n-5\n\n-200\n0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 0.12 0.14\nX\n\n8\n7\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n10000 X\n100\n\nb=2, Q=2\nb=100, Q=2\nb=2, Q=10\nb=100, Q=10\n\n1.2 1.4\n\nb=2 Q=2\nb=100 Q=2\nb=2, Q=10\nb=100, Q=10\n\n90\n80\n\n6\nGluon GPD\n\nGluon GPD\n\n70\n5\n4\n\n60\n50\n40\n\n3\n30\n2\n\n20\n\n1\n\n10\n0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 0.12 0.14\nX\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n10000 X\n\n1.2 1.4\n\nFIG. 8. Sensitivity of the input (Q = 2 GeV) and evolved\n(Q = 10 GeV) GPDs to the choice of the parameter b for the\nprofile functions in eq.(27). We compare large b = 100 with\nthe canonical values of eq.(14) (b = 1.0 for the quark singlet\nand b = 2 for the gluon), using GRV98 forward distributions\nat both small \u03b6 = 0.0001 and large \u03b6 = 0.1 skewedness (right\nand left hand plots respectively). The b = 100 case is shown\nwith thickened lines.\n\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have presented a complete numerical\nsolution for the next-to-leading order (NLO) evolution\nequations for polarized and unpolarized generalised parton distributions (GPDs). We demonstrated that our\nsolutions stay smooth and preserve all the symmetries\nof GPDs, giving us confidence in the correctness of our\nnumerical implementation. We presented the relative effect of moving from leading-order (LO) to NLO for a\ncommon input. We illustrate the effect of NLO skewed\nevolution on the magnitude and shape of two correctlysymmetrized input models based on conventional parton\ndensity functions, for two values of the skewedness parameter, \u03b6 = 0.0001, 0.1, typical of HERA and HERMES\nkinematics. We demonstrate that in NLO, in contrast to\nLO, for small skewedness, the ratio of GPD gluon to PDF\ngluon in the unpolarized case does not have to be larger\n10\n\n\fthan unity in the M S scheme employed here. This new\neffect is directly relevant to the study of small-x exclusive diffractive vector meson and real photon production\nat HERA. The next step is to use these NLO GPDs to\nmake NLO predictions for measurable physical processes\n[39\u201341], such as DVCS, at HERA [7,8], HERMES [9] and\nJefferson Lab [10]. A detailed and direct comparison with\nall available data from a wide range of experimental observables is ultimately required to establish accurately\nthe details of the GPDs.\n\n[16] M.

In order to make a meaningful comparison of the\neffects of skewedness, we evolve both polarized and unpolarized distributions to the common input scale of\nQ0 = 2 GeV before introducing skewedness into the evolution. For computational reasons, we also found it convenient to use a faithful multi-parameter fit to these GRV\nand GRSV distribution rather than using the codes provided by the authors. For GRSV00 we choose the \"standard scenario\" option of unbroken polarised sea distributions.\n[31] The endpoint (z = 1) concentrated terms in eqs.(22,25)\ncan be found in [11] and are determined by the requirement that the zeroth order conformal moment of the kernel has to be zero. Note that in the numerical implementation of the evolution the pure singlet component in the\nqq kernel in both DGLAP and ERBL regions is not regularized (for more details see [11]).\n[32] http://www.phys.psu.edu/ \u0303 cteq/#PDFs\n[33] L.

The NLO evolution enhances this difference and\nthus we do not expect the ratio to approach unity pre-\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nAt the initial stages of this work, A. F. was supported\nby the E.

Note however that the deviation\nis at most 2%. The small wiggles in the curves are artifacts of the fitting procedure since we normalise to the\ncode of GRV98.\nSmall deviations from unity are observed at very large\nX > 0.2 for evolved scales. This results from the fact that\nin our input GPDs we directly implement eqs.(9,10,13)\nand tables.(1,2) of [15] (gluon A) analytically and the\nresultant numbers deviate slightly from those obtained\nfrom the grid-based FORTRAN routine provided by\nGehrman-Stirling at such large X. Since we use the latter\nto normalise this ratio we do not expect to reproduce the\nforward limit with perfect accuracy.\nIn the quark case, we used only the singlet type combination of the down quark since it does not change sign\nas the up and the strange do. A change in sign distorts\nratio plots by a large ratio around the point where the\ndistributions changes sign, since this particular point is\nshifted towards lower X in NLO compared to LO.\nA.
