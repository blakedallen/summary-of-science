Here, part of the Mn atoms (y= 0.25), referred to as MnI, occupy the Ni site\nwhile the remaining Mn (y= 1.0) atoms at the Mn site are referred to MnII. The MnI atoms,\nwhich are 20% of the total Mn atoms, are excess with respect to the stoichiometric Ni2 MnGa\ncomposition. These excess MnI type atoms are expected to have interesting influence on\nthe resistivity, MR, and magnetization, since in related systems like Ni2 Mn1.25 Ga0.75 and\nMn2 NiGa their moments are reported to be anti-parallel to the MnII atoms.10,27 Here, we\nreport an intriguing switching behavior of MR with temperature that is related to the occurrence of martensitic transition at low temperature in the ferrimagnetic state. To the best\nof our knowledge, such MR behavior reported here has not been observed in any magnetic\nmaterial till date. This basically arises from the interplay of magnetism and shape mem2\n\n\fory effect. Our studies indicate possibility of new practical applications for ferromagnetic\nSMA as magnetic sensor for data storage and encryption, whose response can be toggled by\nchanging the temperature. It is envisaged that the multifunctional combination of properties\n(magnetic sensing, magnetocaloric, actuation and shape memory effects) of the ferromagnetic SMA's will be important for their future application.\n\nII.\n\nMETHODS\n\nBulk polycrystalline ingots of Ni1.75 Mn1.25 Ga have been prepared by the standard method\nof melting appropriate quantities of Ni, Mn and Ga (99.99% purity) in an arc furnace. The\ningot was annealed at 1100 K for nine days for homogeneization and subsequently quenched\nin ice water.12,28 The composition has been determined by energy dispersive analysis of xrays using a JEOL JSM 5600 electron microscope. A superconducting magnet from Oxford\nInstruments Inc., U.K. was used for carrying out the longitudinal MR measurements up to\na maximum magnetic field of 8 T.29 MR is defined as \u2206\u03c1m =\n\n\u2206\u03c1\n\u03c10\n\n=\n\n(\u03c1H \u2212\u03c10 )\n,\n\u03c10\n\nwhere \u03c1H and \u03c10\n\nare the resistivities in H and zero field, respectively. The statistical scatter of the resistivity\ndata is 0.03%. M(T ) measurements were performed with Lakeshore 7404 vibrating sample\nmagnetometer with a close cycle refrigerator. M(H) measurements were done using a MPMS\nXL5 SQUID magnetometer. Temperature-dependent powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) data\nwere collected using an 18 kW copper rotating anode-based Rigaku powder diffractometer\nfitted with a graphite monochromator in the diffracted beam. The temperature was stable\nwithin \u00b10.3 K during data collection at each temperature. The data were collected in the\nBragg- Brentano geometry using a scintillation counter.\nSpin-polarized first principle density functional theory calculations were performed by full\npotential linearized augmented plane wave (FPLAPW) method using the WIEN97 code.30\nGeneralized gradient approximation for the exchange correlation was used.31 The muffin-tin\nradii were taken to be Ni: 2.1364 a.u., Mn: 2.2799 a.u., and Ga: 2.1364 a.u. The convergence\ncriterion for total energy was 0.1 mRy, i.e. an accuracy of \u00b10.34 meV/atom. The details of\nthe method of calculation are given elsewhere.9,10\n\n3\n\n\fIII.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nFig. 1 shows the isothermal magnetoresistance (\u2206\u03c1m ) of Ni1.75 Mn1.25 Ga as a function of\nmagnetic field at different temperatures. It can been seen from the figure that at 300 K,\nthe magnitude of \u2206\u03c1m (H) increases with H to -1.35% at 8 T (Fig. 1a). In order to ascertain the H dependence, we have fitted \u2206\u03c1m (H) by a second order polynomial of the form\n\u03b1 H + \u03b2 H2 (solid lines in Fig. 1). We find the second order term (\u03b2) to be very small, the ratio\n\u03b2/\u03b1 being 0.02, which shows that the variation is essentially linear. Similar linear variation\nis obtained up to 150 K, although the magnitude of \u2206\u03c1m decreases to -0.3%. Linear variation\nof negative MR with field has been observed for Ni2 MnGa.21 Also Kataoka has calculated\n\u2206\u03c1m (H) for ferromagnets with different electron concentrations using the s \u2212 d scattering\nmodel, where the scattering of s conduction electrons by localized d spins is suppressed by\nthe magnetic field resulting in a decrease in \u03c1.32 Magnitude of \u2206\u03c1m is shown to increase\nalmost linearly with H for ferromagnetic materials.32 Since Ni1.75 Mn1.25 Ga has large Mn 3d\nlocal moment with high electron concentration (valence electron to atom ratio, e/a= 7.31),\nnegative MR in the 150-300 K range is well described by the s \u2212 d scattering model. As the\ntemperature is lowered, \u2206\u03c1m (H) decreases due to reduction in the spin disorder scattering.\nMR in Fig. 1b shows an interesting behavior: \u2206\u03c1m (H) is positive at 100 K. However,\nat 50 K it is negative, but with a different H dependence compared to the s \u2212 d scattering\nregime (Fig. 1a). In other ferromagnetic Heusler alloys like Ni2 MnSn and Pd2 MnSn, positive\nMR has been observed and attributed to the Lorentz contribution.33 In such cases, \u2206\u03c1m is\npositive at lowest temperatures and decreases as temperature increases. For example, MR\nis positive for Pd2 MnSn at 1.8 K and is negative above 60 K.33 In contrast, the MR variation\nin Ni1.75 Mn1.25 Ga is opposite. Lorentz contribution gives rise to a positive MR when the\ncondition \u03c9 C \u03c4 >> 1 is satisfied, where \u03c9 C and \u03c4 are cyclotron frequency and conduction\nelectron relaxation time, respectively. This condition is valid for extremely pure metallic\nsingle crystals at very low temperatures (where \u03c4 is large and \u03c1\u226410\u22128 \u03a9cm) or at large H\n(where \u03c9 C is large). But for Ni1.75 Mn1.25 Ga, the residual resistivity is large, implying small\n\u03c4 so that even at 8 T the above condition is not satisfied. By the same argument, we expect\na more positive contribution at 5 K compared to 50 K, since the resistivity is lower at 5 K\n(Fig. 2a). On the other hand, the observed data show opposite trend. Hence, the positive\nMR in Ni1.75 Mn1.25 Ga cannot be ascribed to Lorentz force and other mechanisms need to\n4\n\n\fbe explored to understand this finding.\nFig. 2a shows resistivity (\u03c1(T )) at zero and 5 T magnetic field between 5 and 180 K for\ntwo cycles. Above 120 K, where the sample is in the austenitic phase \u03c1(T ) has a positive\ntemperature coefficient of resistance, and the data for the different cycles overlap. Between\n88 and 37 K, the hysteresis in \u03c1(T ) becomes highly pronounced and this is a signature\nof the martensitic transition. The martensitic transition is also clearly shown by the acsusceptibility data in Ref.26 and the low field magnetization data shown in Fig. 4a (discussed\nlatter). The onset of the martensitic transition is depicted by the change in slope in \u03c1 at\nMs (= 76 K, in agreement with Ref.26). The other transition temperatures like martensite\nfinish Mf = 37 K, austenitic start As = 47 K, and austenitic finish Af = 88 K, shown in Fig. 2a,\nconcur with the M(T ) data to be discussed later (Fig. 4a). \u03c1 shows a step centered around\n65 K. This possibly arises due to strain effect on the nucleation and growth of the martensitic\nphase at such low temperatures, and similar effect has been observed in Ni2 FeGa.26\nIn order to establish beyond any doubt that the hysteresis in \u03c1(T ) is related to the\nmartensitic transition, we show the powder XRD pattern at different temperatures in Fig. 3.\nTo record the XRD patterns, Ni1.75 Mn1.25 Ga ingot was crushed to powder and annealed at\n773 K for 10 hrs to remove the residual stress. The L21 cubic austenitic phase is observed up\nto 100 K. There is no signature of any phase transition, related to the formation of a possible\npremartensitic phase around 120 K, which could have been responsible for the upturn in\n\u03c1(T ).\n\nThe lattice constant at 100 K turns out to be aaus = 5.83\u00c5. At 80 K, new peaks\n\nappear. These peaks correspond to the martensitic phase and coexist with the austenite\npeaks. By 40 K, the XRD pattern shows that the martensitic transition is complete as there\nis no austenite phase, in agreement with the \u03c1(T ) data. The XRD patterns have been indexed\nby Le Bail fitting procedure;34 and we find that the martensitic phase is monoclinic in the\nP 2/m space group. The refined lattice constants are a= 4.22, b= 5.50 and c= 29.18 \u00c5, and\n\u03b2= 91.13. Since c\u2248 7\u00d7a, a seven layer modulation may be expected, and such modulated\nstructures with monoclinic or orthorhombic symmetry have been reported for Ni-Mn-Ga.35\nMagnetic field induced strain has been observed in Ni-Mn-Ga for structures that exhibit\nmodulation.13,14 The unit cell volume of the martensitic phase is within 2% of that of the\nequivalent austenitic cell given by 7\u00d7a3aus /2. This shows that the unit cell volume changes\nlittle between the two phases, as expected for a shape memory alloy.36\nAfter establishing the existence of the structural martensitic transition from XRD, we\n5\n\n\fdiscuss the details of the resistivity behavior. \u03c1(T ) at 5T shows a difference in the first and\nsecond FH (field heating) cycles, the first cycle \u03c1(T ) being higher. In the first FH cycle,\nthe sample is subjected to a magnetic field of 5T at 5 K after ZFC (zero field cooling).\nSubsequently, FC data were taken and then the second cycle of FH was measured. Thus,\nwhile in FH first cycle, the magnetic field of 5 T was switched on at 5K, where as in the\nFH second cycle the field is on from RT. The possible reason for the difference in resistivity\nbetween the two FH cycles is discussed later on. In Fig. 2b, we show the MR calculated\nfrom the difference between the ZFC and FC (cooling MR data) and ZFH and FH second\ncycle (heating MR data). But, if the FH first cycle is considered, MR is lower by about\n0.4% at 5 K, which argees with the value in Fig. 1. This is because the MR in Fig. 1, \u2206\u03c1m\nis measured in a different way: at 300 K, H is varied from 0 to 8 to 0 to -8 to 0 Tesla. Then,\nthe specimen was cooled down to the next measurement temperature of 235 K and the field\nwas varied in a similar way. For the next measurement, the sample was heated up to 300 K\nand cooled under zero field condition to the temperature of measurement. Thus, for the\nmartensitic phase, this MR data (Fig. 1) can be related to \u2206\u03c1m calculated from ZFH and\nFH first cycle \u03c1 data (Fig. 2a).\nFig. 2b clearly shows the switching effect in MR as a function of temperature. A comparison of Fig. 2a and b shows a significant correlation between the hysteresis in MR and\n\u03c1(T ). For the cooling cycle, MR is negative from 300 to 135 K, and exhibits a negative to\npositive switching at 135 K. This negative MR region is explained by s \u2212 d scattering, as\ndiscussed above. MR is positive between 135 to 76 K (= Ms ); and this is also manifested in\nMR(H) data at 100 K in Fig. 1b. As discussed earlier, the positive MR cannot be assigned\nto Lorentz force contribution. MR exhibits a positive to negative switching at Ms in the\ncooling cycle. MR becomes negative at Ms with a shallow minimum at 73 K, shows a hump\nat 64 K, and then plunges to large negative values below 64 K, and finally increases slightly\nto reach a temperature independent value of about -3% below 37 K (= Mf ). The shape of\nthe MR(T) curve in Fig. 2b during heating is very similar to that during cooling, but is\nshifted in temperature in the martensitic transition region due to hysteresis. Thus, hysteresis in MR is clearly observed, which indicates the possibility of studying phase co-existence\nand first order phase transition in FSMA's using MR.\nMagnetization measurements have been performed to understand the magnetoresistance\nbehavior. A sharp decrease of magnetization at the martensitic transition (Fig. 4a) in small\n6\n\n\ffields (0.01-0.1 T) is the manifestation of large MCA in the martensitic phase.37 Large MCA\nhas been observed in different Ni-Mn-Ga alloys and is responsible for magnetic field induced\ntwin variant reorientation. The magnetization in the martensitic phase decreases because in\nthe low field, a twinned state with moments along the easy axis ([001]) oriented in dissimilar\ndirections for different twins is energetically favorable. The gradual decrease of magnetization in the austenitic phase, on the other hand, is possibly related to an increase of the\naustenitic phase MCA with decreasing temperature.37 A step-like decrease in magnetization with distinct change of slope is evident at 120 K for both 0.01 and 0.1 T fields (inset,\nFig. 4a). This decrease is significant because it suggests that the upturn in \u03c1(T) and positive\nMR could be related to a magnetic transition that decreases the magnetization.\nFig. 4b shows M(T ) at 5 T in FC and FH. This field is much higher than the saturation\nfield, as shown by the isothermal M \u2212 H curves in Fig. 5. M(T ) shows the characteristic\nvariation of saturation magnetization with temperature. By fitting the higher temperature\nregion using the expression (TC - T)\u03b3 (bold dashed line in Fig. 4b), we obtain an approximate\nestimate of TC to be 380 K. This is close to the TC of 385 K reported for Ni1.8 Mn1.2 Ga.26 In\ncomparison to Fig. 4a, magnetization increases by two orders of magnitude for 5 T FC and\nFH runs. Thus, the changes in the magnetization that are clearly visible in the low field\nmeasurement (Fig. 4a) are not evident here.\n\nFor example, the large relative decrease in\n\nmagnetization in the martensitic phase (Fig. 4a) and the decrease at 120 K are not observed\nin Fig. 4b. Instead, the magnetization gradually increases in the martensitic phase. This\nincrease is intrinsic and is due to higher saturation magnetization in the martensitic phase.\nThis results from alterations in interatomic bonding related to the change of structure, as\nalso observed in Ni2 MnGa.8,38 The saturation moment turns out to be 3.5 \u03bcB . The only\nsignature of the martensitic transition in Fig. 4b is the hysteresis in M(T ) during heating\nand cooling cycles.\n\nHowever, there is hardly any change in the martensitic transition\n\ntemperature with field. This shows that for this alloy, magnetic field does not change Ms\nresulting in magnetic field induced martensitic transition, unlike in Ni-Mn-Sn and Ni-MnIn.3 The isothermal M \u2212 H loop in Fig. 5 shows a decrease in the saturation magnetic\nfield between the martensitic phase (20 K) and the austenitic phase (283 or 360 K). This is\nbecause in the austenitic phase, the MCA is very small and there is no twinning compared\nto the martensitic phase with large MCA and twinning.\nWe have calculated the magnetic ground state using ab initio, spin polarized density\n7\n\n\ffunctional theory employing FPLAPW method to understand the origin of positive MR\nbehavior. Good agreement between experiment and theory has been obtained earlier for\nthe magnetic moments, lattice constants, total energies and the density of states for both\nthe phases.8,9,10,12,28 In particular, the total energies have been used to explain the phase\ndiagram and magnetic states of Ni2 MnGa, Ni2.25 Mn1.75 Ga and Mn2 NiGa.9,10\nHere, we calculate the total energies of the different magnetic states of non-stoichiometric\nNi1.75 Mn1.25 Ga for the L21 structure (see Fig. 1 in Ref.8) with lattice constant of 5.843\u00c5 determined from XRD at room temperature. The structure consists of 4 interpenetrating f.c.c.\nsub-lattices occupied by two Ni atoms, one Mn (MnII) and one Ga atom. To emulate the\nnon-stoichiometric composition, a 16 atom L21 super-cell is considered, where one of the eight\nNi atoms is replaced by one excess MnI type atom.9 Thus, there are seven Ni, five Mn (one\nMnI and four MnII i.e. out of total Mn atoms only 20% are MnI) and four Ga atoms in the\nsuper cell with the chemical formula Ni7 Mn5 Ga4 , which is equivalent to Ni1.75 Mn1.25 Ga. The\ntotal energy that consists of the total kinetic, potential, and exchange correlation energies of\na periodic solid with frozen nuclei has been calculated for two magnetic configurations with\nMnI spin moment parallel and anti-parallel to MnII. We find that the total energy is significantly lower by 16 meV/atom, when MnI is anti-parallel to MnII, compared to their parallel\norientation. Anti-parallel alignment of Mn spins is energetically favored because of the direct\nMnI-MnII nearest neighbor (at 2.53 \u00c5 distance) interaction, as has been shown for other\nMn excess systems like Mn2 NiGa, Ni2 Mn1.25 Ga0.75 and Ni-Mn-Sn.3,10,27 The exchange pair\ninteraction as a function of Mn - Mn separation was calculated by a Heisenberg-like model\nand an antiferromagnetic coupling at short interatomic distances was found.39 Enkovaara\net al. reported antiferromagnetic Mn configuration in Ni2 Mn1.25 Ga0.75 from magnetization\nand first principle calculations.27 Here for Ni1.75 Mn1.25 Ga, the Ni magnetic moment (0.3\u03bcB )\nis parallel to MnII. The MnI and MnII moments for the anti-parallel (parallel) orientation\nare unequal: -2.74 (1.9) and 3.23 (3.16) \u03bcB , respectively.\n\nThus, the magnetic moment\n\nof MnI is smaller than MnII. Smaller magnetic moment for MnI has also been obtained for\nMn2 NiGa, and this has been assigned to stronger hybridization between the majority-spin\nNi and MnII 3d states in comparison to hybridization between Ni and MnI 3d minority-spin\nstates.10\nThe difference in total energy between the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases of\nNi2 MnGa was equated to kB TC .40 Following a similar approach, the total energy difference\n8\n\n\fbetween the ferro- and ferrimagnetic states (16 meV/atom) corresponds to 186 K. As discussed earlier, M(T ) shows a decrease in magnetization at 120 K which is indicative of a\nmagnetic transition. Since from theory, we find that the MnI atoms have magnetic moment\ndifferent from and anti-parallel to the MnII atom, we term the state below 120 K to be ferrimagnetic. Here, anti-parallel alignment of unequal local Mn moments would exist for those\nMnII atoms that have MnI as a nearest neighbor. The estimate of a transition temperature\nof 186 K from theory can be considered to be in fair agreement with the experiment (120 K),\nconsidering that theory considers an ideal situation while the actual conditions may be more\ncomplicated. For example, the MnI atoms would replace the Ni atoms at random positions,\nand absence of any superlattice peak in the XRD pattern (Fig. 3) indeed indicates that. This\ndisorder effect in not considered in theory. Moreover, anti-site defects, possibility of canted\nalignment are not considered by theory. So, in reality, the lattice sites where anti-parallel\nalignment between MnI and MnII moments occurs would be random and the moment of\nMnI could be less than what is calculated. In fact, this is indicated by the underestimation\nof the total moment by theory (3.1 \u03bcB ) compared to the experimental value of 3.5 \u03bcB\n(Fig. 4b).\nTo explain the positive MR shown in Figs. 1 and 2, we note that the application of\nmagnetic field to a state with partial antiferromagnetic alignment of moments (MnI and\nMnII in this case) would induce spin fluctuations, thus increasing the spin disorder and hence\nresistivity that would result in positive MR.41,42 In Eu0.83 Fe4 Sb12 , large positive MR has been\nassigned to a ferrimagnetic or canted magnetic phase.41 We also find that for Ni1.75 Mn1.25 Ga\npositive MR increases linearly with field.\n\nIn many antiferromagnetic intermetallic alloys\n\npositive MR has been observed to increase linearly with H.43 For Eu0.83 Fe4 Sb12 , at low\ntemperatures a H2/3 variation was observed. Linear positive MR has been recently reported\nfor Fe, Co and Ni thin films up to 60 T and has been explained by quantum electron-electron\ninteraction theory.44 To the best of our knowledge, no theoretical prediction exists about\nMR behavior for a ferrimagnet with disordered antiferromagnetic alignment of a fraction of\nthe local moments. To understand the linear MR variation in Ni1.75 Mn1.25 Ga, measurements\nwith higher fields would constitute an interesting study.\nIn the martensitic phase, MR is negative and its magnitude increases up to the saturation\nfield (5 and 50 K data in Fig. 1b). But the behavior is clearly different from the austenitic\nphase: the slope of MR(H) does not change with temperature between 0 to 2 T (see the\n9\n\n\f5 and 50 K plots in Fig. 1b). In contrast, the slope changes between 300, 235 and 150 K\ndata in the austenitic phase where s - d scattering dominates. This indicates that the origin\nof negative MR is different in the martensitic phase. Unlike in Ni2 MnGa,21 here the TC\n(= 380 K) is much higher than Ms (= 76 K) and so the effect of s \u2212 d scattering in the\nmartensitic phase is not visible.\nOne of the reasons for the increase in \u03c1 in the martensitic phase is the scattering of the\nBloch wave functions at the twin boundaries (TB), which are known to increase the defect\ndensity and hence resistivity;45 and this has been reported earlier for FSMA's.46,47 The origin\nof negative MR in the martensitic phase that leads to positive to negative switching of MR\nwhile cooling (Fig. 1b and 2b) possibly arises from the decrease in electron scattering due to\ndecrease in the density of twin boundaries and domain walls with the application of external\nmagnetic field. These are oriented in dissimilar directions at zero field and would tend to\nform larger twin variants and domains as the saturation field is reached. This will have\nsmaller resistivity compared to the twinned state with small sized twins and domains at\nH= 0.19,48 Negative MR due to domain wall scattering has been observed in ferromagnetic\nthin films.49,50,51,52 The hysteresis normally observed in domain wall MR is related to the\nhysteresis of the M \u2212H curve. However, for Ni1.75 Mn1.25 Ga the M \u2212H curves hardly exhibit\nany hysteresis (Fig. 5). For Ni1.75 Mn1.25 Ga, the observation that the increase in the negative\nMR magnitude occurs for fields less than equal to the saturation field (arrow, Fig. 1b),\nsuggests that its origin is linked with the twin and domain rearrangement.\nTwin boundary motion occurs when twinning stress is small and MCA is high governed\nby the condition K > \u01eb0 \u03c3tw , where K is the magnetic anisotropy energy density, \u03c3tw is\nthe twinning stress and \u01eb0 is the maximal strain given by (1 \u2212 c/a).14 For this specimen,\nhigh MCA is expected because Ms is much lower than TC and this is supported by magnetization data in Fig. 4a. In fact, the decrease in magnetization at Ms gives rise to inverse\nmagnetocaloric effect, and its magnetic field dependence has been explained by twin variant reorientation.53 From XRD, we find that the unit cell volume remains similar across\nthe martensitic transition and the structure is modulated in the martensitic phase (Fig. 3).\nModulated structures have lower twinning stress and hence are expected to exhibit twin\nboundary motion.54 These indicate that Ni1.75 Mn1.25 Ga would have small twinning stress\nand thus exhibit twin boundary motion. In fact, highest MFIS of 10% has been reported\nin a Mn excess specimen with composition of Ni1.95 Mn1.19 Ga0.86 that exhibits seven layer\n10\n\n\fmodulated structure and a low twinning stress of 2 MPa.14 MFIS has been reported to occur\nin polycrystals that are textured and with large grain size, in trained samples, and also in\nfine grained systems.6,16,18,55,56,57 In our case, the specimen has been annealed for more than\na week at 1100 K, and that leads to the growth of large grains (200-500 \u03bcm). On the other\nhand, in the absence of field, the width of the twins is only a few microns.19,48,58 Thus, within\na grain the twins are ubiquitous and twin boundary rearrangement can occur due to external\nmagnetic field. Coarse grained Ni-Mn-Ga is known to show larger MFIS, while annealing of\nNi-Mn-Ga ribbons is reported to increase the MFIS by an order of magnitude.59\n\nSozinov\n\net al. obtained single variant state for polycrystalline Ni-Mn-Ga at 1 T.18 For polycrystals,\nsince the grains are oriented randomly, which lead to internal geometric constraints, for\nexample, the motion of the twin boundaries would be suppressed by the grain boundaries,\nthe macroscopic strain is small. However, at the microscopic level within a grain the twin\nboundary motion is expected to occur in Ni1.75 Mn1.25 Ga and this is what is important in\nthe present context to explain the negative MR behavior in the martensitic phase. The\ncharacteristic shape of the MR curve in the martensitic phase in polycrystalline Ni-Mn-Ga\nhas been explained by twin variant rearrangement with magnetic field.21\nThe difference in resistivity between the first and second FH cycles (Fig. 2) can be related\nto the extent of twin boundary rearrangement. Lower values of \u03c1(T ) in second FH cycle,\nwhich is recorded after cooling in presence of magnetic field across the martensitic transition\nfrom 300 K, indicate that the field would more effectively reorient the twins as soon as these\nare formed below Ms . On the other hand, for FH first cycle where \u03c1 is higher the magnetic\nfield is switched on at 5 K. Thus, although MCA increases with decreasing temperature,37\ntwinning stress may also increase limiting the extent of twin variant rearrangement forming\nlarger twins. The variation of negative MR with temperature in the martensitic phase shown\nin Fig. 2b is significant because the heating and cooling data are very similar. This may\nbe related to the microscopic details of the domain and twin variant reorientation with\ntemperature and further studies are required to explain this.\nAnother interesting observation in the MR of the martensitic phase is as follows: above\nthe saturation field although MR is negative, a positive component is evident from its gradual\nincrease with field (see Fig. 1b). For example, at 50 K MR increases from -0.2% at 1 T to\n-0.1% at 8 T. A weakly increasing MR is also observed for the 5 K data, but its slope is\nless compared to 50 K. This shows that at lower temperatures where thermal fluctuations\n11\n\n\fdecrease, higher field would be required to induce spin disorder in the ferrimagnetic state\nfor causing similar increase in MR. This, in turn, supports the argument that below 120 K\nthe magnetic state is ferrimagnetic in nature. Thus, there are two competing effects that\ngovern MR in the martensitic phase with increasing field: a dominant negative trend due to\nthe formation of larger size twin variants and domains and a weaker positive trend due to\nthe ferrimagnetic nature of the magnetic state. While the first effect is present only up to\nthe saturation field, the second effect becomes visible only above the saturation field.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe switching of MR from negative to positive and back to negative values with decreasing\ntemperature is observed in a Mn excess ferromagnetic shape memory alloy Ni1.75 Mn1.25 Ga.\nPositive MR below 120 K in the austenitic phase is related to a ferrimagnetic state where\nthe excess Mn atoms (MnI) at Ni site are antiferromagnetically oriented with the Mn atoms\nat Mn site (MnII). The existence of the ferrimagnetic state is shown by density functional\ntheory, and experimental evidence is obtained from a decrease in magnetization and resistivity upturn at 120 K. In the martensitic phase, negative MR arises due to decrease in\nelectron scattering related to reduction in the density of twin boundaries and domain walls\nwith the application of external magnetic field. This effect is visible up to the saturation\nmagnetic field. Above this, a weaker positive trend due to the ferrimagnetic nature of the\nmagnetic state is visible. On the other hand, negative MR above 120 K in the ferromagnetic\naustenitic phase is explained by the s \u2212 d scattering model. The hysteresis in MR(T) is a\nmanifestation of the first order nature of the martensitic phase transition.\n\nV.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\n\nWe are grateful to S. N. Kaul, A. K. Majumdar, E. V.

MR has been measured\nin the cooling cycle. The arrow indicates the saturation magnetic field at 20 K. Solid lines\nare fit to the data.\nFig. 2: (Color online) (a) Resistivity (\u03c1) as a function of temperature at zero and 5 T\nfield for Ni1.75 Mn1.25 Ga between 5 to 180 K for two cooling and heating cycles. The data\nhas been recorded in the following sequence: zero-field heating (ZFH); zero-field cooling\n(ZFC); the sample is then subjected to a magnetic field of 5T and field-cooled heating (FH,\nfirst cycle) is done up to RT; field-cooled cooling (FC) and once again FH (second cycle)\nwas measured. As , Af , Ms , and Mf are the austenitic and martensitic start and finish\ntemperatures, respectively. (b) Magnetoresistance during cooling and heating calculated\nfrom the difference of \u03c1(T ) at zero and 5 T after interpolating to same temperature intervals.\nThe difference has been taken between ZFC and FC in the cooling cycle and ZFH and FH\nsecond cycle while heating.\nFig. 3: X-ray diffraction pattern of Ni1.75 Mn1.25 Ga as a function of temperature while cooling.\nThe calculated profiles obtained by Le Bail fitting (solid line through the experimental data\npoints) are shown for 150 and 40 K data. A and M indicate the peaks related to the\naustenitic and martensitic phases, respectively.\nFig. 4: (a) Temperature dependence of magnetization in (a) a small applied field of 0.01 T\nFig. 5: Isothermal M \u2212 H loops at different temperatures.\n\n17\n\n\flayout50, Graph63_1, R-MR.pxp\n\n4\n\nA\n\n(x 4)\n\nM\n\nA\n\nM\n\nM\n\nM\n\nM\n\n-4\n\nM\n\n42\n\n(/ 2)\nA\n\n-1.0\n\n(-2 0 16)\n\nM\n\nM\n(-1 2 7)\n\n(-2 0 1)\n\nM\nM\n(1 1 11)\n\nM\n(-1 0 12)\n\n40\n\n20K\n100K\n283K\n360K\n\n(x 5)\n\n(x 12)\n\n80K\n\n40K\n\nA\n\n-2\n\n100K\n\n(0 0 14)\n\nintensity (arb. unit )\n\n120K\n\n0\n\n(620)\n\n150K\n\n(220)\n\nM (\u03bcB / f.u.)\n\n2\n\n(x 3)\n\n46 66\n\n44\n2\n\n\u03b8 (degree)\n\n68 112\n\n114\n\n0.0\n\n\u03bc0H (tesla)\n\n1.0\n\n\f"}
