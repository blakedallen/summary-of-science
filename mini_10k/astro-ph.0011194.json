We analyzed RXTE data of GRS 1915+105 of X-ray low states between\n1996 and 1998. The X-ray spectrum is dominated by the power law component. We\nfound (i) that the power law is pivoting at 10-30 keV, (ii) that the power law slope\ncorrelates with radio flux, (iii) three different groups of 3-10 keV residuals, (iv) that\none of these residual groups correlates with the power law slope.\nKeywords: X-ray binary, GRS 1915+105, X-ray spectroscopy\n\nThe prototypical microquasar GRS 1915+105 was discovered by\nGranat (Castro-Tirado, Brandt & Lund 1992) as a transient X-ray\nsource. Observations with RXTE PCA revealed astonishing X-ray variability (Greiner et al. 1996) which has been classified into a dozen\ndifferent X-ray states (Belloni et al. 2000).\nWe analyzed 68 observations from the RXTE public archive of GRS\n1915+105 during X-ray low states, so called \u03c7-states (Belloni et al.\n2000; no large amplitude variations nor obvious structured variability)\nfrom November 1996 to June 1998. For each observation we used PCU\n0 data of the PCA and binned HEXTE cluster A data and fitted these\nwith a model consisting of cold absorption (wabs), disk blackbody\n(diskbb) and reflection (refsch, including a power law) in XSPEC with a\nfixed folding energy of 400 keV and solar abundances. Energies between\n4 and 8.5 keV were ignored during the fit.\nAll reduced X-ray spectra can be divided into three groups depending on the residuals in the energy range 3-10 keV. The first group shows\na small hump at 6.4 keV and a dip at 4.5 keV, and the second group has\ntwo broad humps at 4.5 and 6 keV. Both groups are mainly seen during\nthe long 1997 low state. The third group has a deep dip at 4.5 keV as\nthe only feature and occurs only at times of radio flares. A deepening\nof the \"dip\"-residuals with steeper power law and increasing radio flux\nis seen, whereas no such trend is visible for the other groups. This\ncorrelation between dip depth and radio flares suggests that the depth\nis connected with the strengths of a possibly nearly-spherical outflow\nor accretion disk wind (inclination is 70\u25e6 from radio jet characteristics,\ne.g. nearly edge-on) where a part may be collimated into a jet.\nDuring \u03c7-states (independent of the three residual groups) an increasing PCA count rate is related to a decreasing HEXTE count rate\nand an increasing spectral photon index. Interestingly, the power law\nc 2018 Kluwer Academic Publishers. Printed in the Netherlands.\n\nrau_PIV-03.tex; 28/11/2018; 19:57; p.1\n\n\f2\n\nRau & Greiner\n\nFigure 1. X-ray power law photon index as function of a) the 3-200 keV power law\nflux and b) the 2.25 GHz Green Bank Interferometer (GBI) radio flux.\n\npivotes at 10-30 keV, while the disk component is always negligible.\nTherefore a factor of 3-4 in PCA count rate can be explained by a\nvarying power law flux by the same factor (Fig. 1a). Thus, the power\nlaw producing corona of hot electrons can be the origin of the observed\ncount rate variation. An increasing photon index is caused by a decreasing electron temperature in the corona and the observed variation\nimplies a temperature variation between 25 and 50 keV (Sazonov &\nSunyaev 2000).\nAlso correlated with the power law slope is the 2.25 GHz radio flux\nas measured with the GBI such that a higher photon index (lower electron temperature) is related to higher radio flux (Fig. 1b). This could\nbe due to a shift of the synchrotron radiation to longer wavelengths\nwith decreasing electron temperature. This would be in agreement to a\ncorrelation of the K band flux with the X-ray hardness ratio (Greiner\net al. 2001).\n\nReferences\nBelloni T., Klein-Wolt M., Mendez M. et al. 2000, A&A 355, 271\nCastro-Tirado A.J., Brandt S., Lund N., 1992, IAU Circ., 5590\nGreiner J., Morgan E., Remillard R.A., 1996, ApJ, 473, L107\nGreiner J., Vrba F.J., Henden A.A. et al. 2001, these proceedings\nSazonov S.Y., Sunyaev R.A., 2000, AstL, 26, 494\n\nrau_PIV-03.tex; 28/11/2018; 19:57; p.2\n\n\f"}
