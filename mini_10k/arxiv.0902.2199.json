INTRODUCTION\n\nClassical Novae (CNe) are caused by nuclear explosions in cataclysmic variables. A history of accretion of\nhydrogen-rich material from a main-sequence star onto\nthe white dwarf (WD) primary can lead to sufficient\npressure in the surface envelope for thermonuclear runaway to occur. Enough radiation is produced to launch\na radiatively-driven wind that ejects the outer envelope\nand forms an optically-thick shell around the WD within\nwhich the high-energy radiation that is produced by nuclear burning is initially trapped. The radiative output\nof the nova then occurs primarily in the optical, but\nas the mass ejection rate decreases, the radius of approximately unit opacity shrinks, and successively hotter\nlayers become visible (see, e.g., Gallagher & Starrfield\n1978). If nuclear burning continues long enough, the\npeak of the spectral energy distribution eventually shifts\ninto the X-ray regime, and at that time the nova emits\nan X-ray spectrum that resembles those typically observed in the class of supersoft X-ray sources (SSS:\nKahabka & van den Heuvel 1997). For a review of nova\nevolution see, e.g., Starrfield et al. (2008).\nEarly X-ray emission has been detected in several cases\nthat was much harder than typical SSS spectra (e.g.,\nLloyd et al. 1992; Krautter et al. 1996; Mukai & Ishida\n2001; Orio et al. 2001). The origin of this emission is\nnot entirely clear because it has never been observed\nwith sufficient signal-to-noise ratio and spectral resolution to constrain theoretical models. The observed\nspectra are generally a good match to optically thin\nOxford Street, Manchester, M13 9PL, UK\n\n\f2\nplasma models (e.g., Krautter et al. 1996; Balman et al.\n1998; Orio et al. 2001), which suggests that the plasma\nis collisional. Mukai & Ishida (2001) argued that shocks\nwithin the nova ejecta were responsible, and this is\nconsistent with earlier work by Lloyd et al. (1992) and\nO'Brien et al. (1994). In some cases, hard emission\nline spectra have also been observed after the nova had\nturned off (e.g., V382 Vel: Ness et al. 2005). This has\nbeen attributed to nebular emission that originates from\nthe surrounding medium that had been heated by radiation from the nova. However, some of the emission\nlines that have been observed arise at energies too high\nto be explained by photoexcitation. It is possible that\nthese lines are part of the continuing hard component,\nwhich would imply that the cooling time scales of the\nhard component are extremely long, up to years.\nA different situation is the case of symbiotic novae\nsuch as RS Oph, where the secondary is a giant with\na dense stellar wind. The ejecta run into the stellar\nwind, dissipating some kinetic energy, producing X-ray\nradiation. The luminosity of the emission from these\nshock systems is much higher than observed in Classical\nNovae, and well-exposed X-ray spectra with high spectral resolution have been obtained (Ness et al. 2009). In\nClassical Novae, the secondary is a Main-Sequence star\nwhere the wind is not dense enough for this scenario\n(O'Brien et al. 1994).\nIn order to understand the evolution of the X-ray emission of novae, more systematic observations are required,\nas exemplified by recent Swift campaigns on RS Oph and\nV2491 Cyg (Osborne et al. 2008, Bode et al. 2006, Page\net al., in preparation). Here, we present Swift monitoring\nobservations of the nova V458 Vul, which was discovered\nby H. Abe 2007, August 8.54 at 9.5 mag (Nakamura et al.\n2007; see also Henden & Munari 2007). Buil & Fujii\n(2007) found P-Cygni profiles in H-\u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 lines, as\nwell as in various He i lines with full-width at half maximum (FWHM) corresponding to \u223c 1700 \u2212 1900 km s\u22121 .\nOn these grounds, they classified it as a Classical Nova.\nImages obtained by the IPHAS survey (Drew et al. 2005)\nshortly before the nova outburst, reveal a point source\nnova progenitor surrounded by a faint shell. Follow-up\nimaging and spectroscopy imply this is a slow moving\nand massive shell of a planetary nebula (PN) as opposed to a fast-moving and much lower mass nova remnant (Wesson et al. 2008). The only other likely example of a Classical Nova occurring inside a PN was Nova\nGK Per 1901 (Bode et al. 2004). The optical decline of\nV458 Vul was observed in detail by Poggiani (2008), and\nthe time scale t2 (time for decline by 2 mag) was estimated at 7 days. The maximum magnitude versus rate\nof decline relationship (MMRD) for the smoothed light\ncurve implies a distance of 6.7-10.3 kpc (Poggiani 2008),\nand the relation derived by della Valle & Livio (1995)\nleads to a distance of 8.8 \u00b1 0.8 kpc. However, the optical\nlight curve showed two strong flare-like peaks on days\n4 and 10 after outburst (Tarasova 2007). This complicates the determination of a reliable decline time, and the\nMMRD relationship method may not work very well for\nnovae with such erratic early light curves. Wesson et al.\n(2008) found a distance of 13 kpc based on light travel\ntime from the nova to the flash-ionized nebula and\nother methods, and we adopt this value for our pur-\n\nposes. The interstellar extinction (AV,ISM ) was estimated\nto be 1.76 \u00b1 0.32 mag (Poggiani 2008). This converts\nto an interstellar hydrogen-equivalent extinction column\ndensity of NH,ISM = (3.15 \u00b1 0.57) \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 using\nthe relation NH,ISM /AV,ISM = 1.79 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 mag\u22121\n(Predehl & Schmitt 1995). The HEASARC NH tool20\ncalculates the total Galactic H i column density for\nany direction using the Leiden/Argentine/Bonn (LAB;\nKalberla et al. 2005) and Dickey & Lockman (1990)\nGalactic H I surveys. For a cone of radius 0.5\u25e6 centered on the J(2000) coordinates of V458 Vul, the LAB\nand Dickey & Lockman (1990) maps give an average\nNH value of 3.7 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 . Lynch et al. (2007) found\nE(B \u2212 V ) = 0.6, which converts to 3.6 \u00b1 1.2 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122\nusing the relation NH /E(B \u2212 V ) = 6 \u00b1 2 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 by\nDickey & Lockman (1990); Bohlin et al. (1978).\nA number of photometric periods were reported by\nGoranskij et al. (2008), and they attributed a periodicity\nof 0.58946 days (14.147 hours) to the orbital modulation.\nWe caution, however, that different periods have been\ndetected in different observations (Wesson et al. 2008)\nand finding the orbital period is not a straightforward\ntask. Apart from the two flares in the early optical light\ncurve, Tarasova (2007) found changes in the line widths\nthat were related to these brightenings. Such events have\nbeen observed in other novae as well (e.g., in V723 Cas or\nV2362 Cyg, Goranskij et al. 2007 and Lynch et al. 2008,\nrespectively). The nature of rebrightenings in novae is\nunclear, and secondary ejection events or interactions\nwith the accretion disk have been proposed (Lynch et al.\n2008).\nThe first X-ray observation of V458 Vul was obtained\n1.2 days after outburst21 with the X-Ray Telescope\n(XRT) aboard Swift but yielded no detection (see below). Observations at this early stage of nova evolution\nare justified by the X-ray detection of V838 Her approximately 5 days after discovery (Lloyd et al. 1992). 70 days\nlater, another Swift observation of V458 Vul was carried\nout, and Drake et al. (2007) found 192 X-ray counts in\na 6.7-ks exposure. From thermal models they estimated\na plasma temperature of kT = 0.2+0.40\n\u22120.07 keV and an ab21\nsorbing column of NH = 8+2\n\u00d7\n10\ncm\u22122 . Around day\n\u22123\n88 after outburst (2007, November 4), a Suzaku observation with medium spectral resolution and higher S/N\nthan obtained by Swift was carried out using the X-ray\nImaging Spectrometer (XIS: Koyama et al. 2007), and\nTsujimoto et al. (2008) found a plasma temperature of\n21\n\u22122\nfrom\n0.64 \u00b1 0.07 keV and NH = 3.1+1.8\n\u22121.3 \u00d7 10 cm\noptically-thin collision-dominated plasma emission models. Since the Suzaku detectors have higher spectral resolution than the Swift XRT, individual lines can be identified, and the spectrum is clearly an emission line spectrum. Tsujimoto et al. (2008) investigated the chemical\ncomposition and found overabundances of Ne, Mg, Si\nand S, and an underabundance of Fe. For O they determined an upper limit of 1.5 times solar. On day 397,\nthe nova entered the SSS phase with a highly variable\nSwift XRT count rate (Drake et al. 2008). The aim of\nthis paper is the study of the evolution of the hard X20\n\nhttp://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/Tools/w3nh/w3nh.pl\nAll times are given in days after discovery, 2007, August 8.54,\nand are mid-times between start and end of the observations\n21\n\n\f3\nray component that was first observed on day 71 after\noutburst (Drake et al. 2007). In \u00a72 we describe four observing campaigns with optical, ultraviolet, and X-ray\nobservations. For the Swift observations taken after day\n397 we only analyze the hard X-ray emission component\nand postpone the analysis of the SSS phase to a later paper that will be published after the SSS phase has ended.\nIn \u00a73 we discuss our results, and summarize our conclusions in \u00a74.\n2. OBSERVATIONS\n\nIn this paper we present 31 Swift XRT (Burrows et al.\n2005) and UVOT (Roming et al. 2005) observations\ntaken between August 2007 and September 2008. The\nobservations are grouped in four campaigns (see Table 1),\none observation only 1.2 days after the outburst, ten observations taken between days 71 and 140.5, eight observations taken between days 315 and 390, and twelve\nobservations taken during the SSS phase, after day 390\n(Drake et al. 2008). The fourth campaign was a highdensity campaign in response to the emergence of the\nbright SSS component. In this paper we analyze only\nthe hard emission component of the observations taken\nduring the fourth campaign and postpone the analysis\nof the SSS phase because it has not ended at the time\nof writing. During the third campaign we also obtained\ndense ground-based optical monitoring observations in\nthe V -band.\n\nto produce level 2 products (sky images for UVOT observations and cleaned event files for XRT observations).\nUV fluxes were extracted from the sky images using standard tools, and X-ray count rates were obtained from the\ncleaned event files following the procedure described by\nNess et al. (2007).\nWe have determined the source count rate using a\ncircular source extraction region with radius 10 pixels\n(= 23.6\u2032\u2032 ), and an annular background region with inner\nand outer radii of 10 and 80 pixels, respectively. This\nouter radius (= 188.8\u2032\u2032) was chosen so as to exclude a\nnearby X-ray source. The analysis procedure adopted\nfrom Ness et al. (2007) corrects for source photons contained in the wings of the point spread function (PSF)\nthat are recorded in the background region. We have\nalso corrected for losses in cases where the source position coincided with bad columns on the detector. The\nbad columns can be identified on the exposure maps, and\nwe have calculated a correction factor by comparing the\neffective areas extracted from the level 2 event file and\nfrom the exposure map.\n\n2.1. Optical observations\n\nGround-based photometric time series of V458 Vul\nwere obtained during the period July 8 to August\n28 using four different 0.28\u20130.4 m telescopes located\nin Wales, England, Belgium and New Hampshire, US,\nand are equipped with SBIG or Starlight Express cameras. Images were processed in a standard fashion using\nMaxIm DL and AIP4WIN, and differential magnitudes\nwere measured using USNO-B1.0 1108-0459444, 11090453942, and 1108-0459876 as comparison stars. Instrumental magnitudes were then converted to a pseudoV band using the AAVSO photometric sequence for\nV458 Vul.\n2.2. Swift UV and X-ray observations\n\nIn the left part of Table 1 we list all Swift observations, giving the date and time when each observation\nstarted and ended, the corresponding number of days after outburst (averaged between start- and stop times),\nthe ObsID, and the exposure time. Due to its low-Earth\norbit, Swift can only observe a given target for a maximum of \u223c 2 ks every 96-minute revolution, and each observation consists of a number of these short snapshots.\nThe XRT observations are integrated over all snapshots,\nwhile the UVOT filters can be switched during an observation. The bandpasses for each filter are given in terms\nof central wavelengths and full width at half maximum\n(FWHM) in the header of the right part of Table 1.\n2.2.1. Reduction procedures\n\nWe have used the Swift tools version 2.9 with CALDB\n2.9, which are part of the HEADAS software package22\n22\n\nhttp://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/lheasoft/\n\nFig. 1.- Comparison of the X-ray light curve, X-ray hardness\n(top two panels; with S and H the count rates in the bands 0.25 \u2212\n1 keV and 1 \u2212 10 keV, respectively), and UV fluxes. After day 400\nthe X-ray count rate is higher than 90 counts per ks due to the\nSSS phase component, and these rates don't fit in the top graph.\n\nIn the right part of Table 1, we list the corrected\nXRT count rates with 1-\u03c3 uncertainties or 95-% upper limits, hardness ratios, and UVOT fluxes. The\nXRT hardness ratio is defined conventionally here as\nHR = (H \u2212 S)/(H + S), with H and S the number of\ncounts in a hard and soft X-ray band, respectively. With\nthis definition, the hardness ratio is +1 for very hard\nsources and -1 for very soft sources. We have calculated\nthe hardness ratios using an energy band of 0.25 \u2212 1 keV\nfor S and 1\u221210 keV for H. We chose these ranges to yield\na roughly equal number of counts in each band in order\nto minimize the uncertainties in the hardness ratios.\n2.2.2. Four observing campaigns\n\nIn Fig. 1 we illustrate the evolution of X-ray count\nrates and hardness ratios (top two panels) and the UVOT\nfluxes (in units of 10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , bottom three panels) during the first \u223c 420 days.\nFor day 1.2, we find a 95-per cent upper limit of\n0.0021 cps.

The uvw2 flux corresponds to a luminosity of 4\u00d71033 erg s\u22121 in the waveband\n1271 \u2212 2585 \u00c5.\nFrom day 71 to day \u223c 100, the X-ray count rate increases monotonically, while the hardness stays about\nthe same. A small drop in count rate after day \u223c 100\nis accompanied by a reduction in hardness. The spectrum does not evolve into that of an SSS at this time.\nWe have studied the likelihood for the hardness ratio being variable during campaign II. All values are consistent\nwith their mean, and assuming a constant ratio of +0.02\nyields a reduced \u03c72 = 0.8. The UV flux has significantly\ndecreased from campaign I to II, and the corresponding UV luminosity varies between 5 \u00d7 1032 erg s\u22121 and\n1.5 \u00d7 1033 erg s\u22121 in the waveband 1271 \u2212 2585 \u00c5, thus a\nfactor around 10 lower than in campaign I.\nCampaign III starts with a lower X-ray count rate compared to campaign II, but the spectrum is significantly\nsofter. However, 30 days into campaign III, the hardness ratio was back up again, and the observation taken\non day 315 is the only campaign-III observation that\n\nhas a SSS component. In campaign III we have used\nthe same UVOT filter (uvw1) for all observations, and\nthe UV luminosity varies between 6 \u00d7 1031 erg s\u22121 and\n1.6 \u00d7 1032 erg s\u22121 in the waveband 1900 \u2212 3300 \u00c5.\nIn Fig. 2 we present details of the first observation\nof campaign III (day 315), showing detailed X-ray light\ncurves in two energy bands and the simultaneous uvw1\nlight curve. Three data points are missing because of\ntracking problems in orbits 7, 8, and 10, during which\nthe source was not in the field. We have excluded these\norbits for extracting the average count rate listed in Table 1. In the soft band a flare-like event with a peak\naround day 314.86 and a duration less than 0.4 days is\nseen which has no counterpart in harder X-rays or the\nuvw1 fluxes. A similar flare event has been reported\nby Drake et al. (2003) in the nova V1494 Aql (see also\nRohrbach et al. 2009). The hard X-ray count rate seems\nto be anticorrelated with the uvw1 fluxes, as each increase in X-ray count rate coincides with a decrease in\nUV brightness.

A small flare is seen in the soft X-ray component.\nThe hard X-ray count rate and the uvw1 flux are suggestive of an\nanticorrelation, but a Spearman rank test with eleven values gives\na coefficient of \u22120.43, which is not significant.\n\nfluxes, we have computed a Spearman rank coefficient23\nof rS = \u22120.43. This corresponds to a < 2\u03c3 probability\nof an anti-correlation which thus cannot be considered\nstatistically significant.\nIn Fig. 3 we show the X-ray and uvw1 datapoints for\nall observations taken between days 315 and 390 (campaign III). In order to study only the hard emission,\nwe extracted the X-ray count rates in the band pass\n0.6 \u2212 10 keV. Our choice of energy range here is based on\nthe spectrum that is shown in Fig. 6 (dark grey shade),\nwhere it can be seen that below 0.6 keV the emission\nis dominated by the new soft component. For comparison we include the V -band magnitudes described in \u00a72.1,\nand they show the same long-term variations as the uvw1\ndata.\nFrom the top two panels it is again suggestive that\nthe hard X-ray count rates anticorrelate with the uvw1\nfluxes. In order to illustrate this anticorrelation, we have\nrescaled the X-ray count rates to the uvw1 fluxes and\ninverted the X-ray light curve. In the bottom panel of\nFig. 3 we show the inverse X-ray light curve in comparison to the uvw1 fluxes. The same up- and down trends\ncan be seen. The Spearman rank coefficient is rS = \u22120.59\nfor all eight datapoints but rS = \u22120.93 if excluding the\nobservation taken on day 390. A reason to exclude this\ndata point would be that the UV flux in this observation\ncould already be affected by emission from the WD, as a\nbright SSS spectrum was observed only a week later (see\nFig. 4). The latter correlation yields a 97-% probability,\nwhich is suggestive of a real anticorrelation.\nNext, we have tested the proposed orbital solution\ngiven by Goranskij et al.

The\ncomparison of the inverted X-ray light curve with the uvw1 light\ncurve is shown in the bottom panel and illustrates the anticorrelation. The Spearman rank test on the first seven datapoints yields a\n97-% probability that the anticorrelation is real, but with the last\ndata point (day 390) included, the indication for an anticorrelation\nis much weaker. A reason could be that at that time the UV flux\nis affected by the emerging SSS component (see text).\n\nthis period. We performed additional period checks on\nthe uvw1 light curve of days 315 to 390 but found no\nconvincing evidence for any periodic changes. We note\nthat a period search is difficult with the interrupted light\ncurves available from Swift.\nAfter day 397 the SSS phase started, and a campaign\nof monitoring at higher cadence was initiated (campaign\nIV; see Drake et al. 2008). In this paper we focus on\nthe evolution of the hard component and postpone the\ndiscussion of the SSS phase to a future paper. In order\nto trace the evolution of the hard component separately\nfrom the SSS emission, we have extracted the light curves\nin the energy bands 0.25 \u2212 0.7 keV and 0.7 \u2212 10 keV, respectively. We chose a higher pivot energy of 0.7 keV in\norder to exclude any SSS emission from the hard band\npass (see Fig. 6). The brightness of the SSS component\nleads to significant effects of pile up, whereby two incoming X-rays are counted as one count of twice the energy.\nIn order to avoid contamination of the hard component\nby these counts, we have corrected for pile up by excluding the central 5 pixels for the time intervals when the\ntotal count rate was between 0.3 and 0.5 cps, and 7 pix-\n\n\f6\n\nFig. 4.- Soft and hard X-ray light curves (top two panels) and\ncorresponding uvw1 fluxes for campaign IV. The pivot energy is\nchosen higher to avoid contamination of the hard count rates by\nSSS emission. All X-ray count rates are corrected for pile up (see\ntext).\n\nels when it was above 0.5 cps. The extracted count rates\nhave then been upscaled, yielding the PSF-integrated total number of counts. We note, however, that the pile up\ncorrection leads to small raw numbers of counts, which\nleads to large statistical uncertainties. Detailed analyzes\nare thus not possible for the faint hard component. In\nFig. 4, we compare the evolution of the corrected soft\n(0.25\u22120.7 keV) and hard (0.7\u221210 keV) X-ray count rates\nand of the uvw1 fluxes (top to bottom, respectively). The\nhard component is still present, and the corrected count\nrates are consistent with those found in the pre-SSS observations. In the middle panel of Fig. 4 one can see\nthat the hard count rate exhibits variability that is uncorrelated to that of the soft flux (top panel). The hard\ncomponent is thus unaffected by the SSS emission and\ncan be assumed to continue to fade at a very slow rate.\nHowever, no significant reduction in count rate can be\nidentified from the middle panel of Fig. 4.\n\nFig. 5.- XRT spectrum integrated over days 71-140.5 (total of\n25 ks). The solid line is a thermal model (VAPEC with variable\nabundances) with the parameters listed in Table 2. Labels are\nincluded at energies where strong lines are expected. The instrumental response at 1 keV is 200 eV FWHM, and strong isolated\nlines can be identified.\n\n2.3. Spectral analysis\n\nIn Fig. 5 we show the X-ray spectrum integrated over\nthe time interval from day 71 to 140.5 (campaign II).\n\nWe have included labels at the energies where strong\nemission lines can in principle arise. Strong emission\npeaks appear at the wavelengths of silicon and nitrogen\nlines, while the lines of magnesium are weaker. The full\nwidth at half maximum (FWHM) of the XRT spectral\nresponse is \u223c 200 eV at 1 keV. Between 0.7 \u2212 1.0 keV the\nH-like and He-like Ne lines overlap with strong Fe xvii\nL-shell lines. The combined XRT spectrum resembles\nthe Suzaku spectrum taken on day 88 after outburst (see\nTsujimoto et al. 2008).\nWe have modeled the XRT spectrum using an isothermal VAPEC model (Smith et al. 2001), which represents\na collisional, optically thin plasma. We have used the\nxspec fitting package, version 11.3.2ag (Arnaud 1996),\nallowing variable abundances for N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, and\nFe, with the abundances of all other elements fixed at the\nsolar values of Anders & Grevesse (1989). In order to account for absorption in the interstellar medium (ISM) we\nhave used the tbabs module with the single parameter\nNH , the neutral hydrogen column density in cm\u22122 , assuming solar composition of the ISM (Wilms et al. 2000).\nWe have optimized the parameters using cstat statistics\nwith which we avoid having to rebin the spectrum. We\nhave used the error command to compute 90% uncertainty ranges.\nThe results and 90% uncertainty ranges for each parameter are listed in Table 2. The temperature, kT , neutral hydrogen column density, NH , element abundances,\nand X-ray luminosity are in good agreement with the parameters found from Suzaku spectra by Tsujimoto et al.\n(2008), indicating little evolution in the hot plasma between the respective epochs of the Swift average spectrum analyzed here (days 71-141) and the Suzaku (day\n88) spectra. From the average count rate we determine a rough count rate-to-luminosity conversion factor\nof 5\u00d71035 erg s\u22121 cps\u22121 , thus the upper limit of 0.002 cps\nfor day 1.2 converts to an upper limit to the luminosity\nof 1033 erg s\u22121 over 0.25 \u2212 10 keV. Element abundances\nare all consistent with solar values, except for that of\nFe, which we find to be at least a factor of two lower.\nUnderabundance of Fe is possibly common in post-AGB\nstars which have undergone dredge-up of s-processed material. Low Fe abundances have also been found in the\nX-ray spectra of novae, e.g., RS Oph (Ness et al. 2009)\nand V382 Vel (Ness et al. 2005). Unfortunately, abundances of N and O could not be usefully constrained.\nThe upper limit found for N is relatively high, and allows for the possibility that the hot gas is enriched by\nCNO processing. The plasma temperature lies in the\nrange 0.58-0.7 keV.\nThe best-fit model is included with a solid line in Fig. 5.\nThe model represents a satisfactory fit. To give a goodness criterion, we have calculated a value of reduced\n\u03c72 = 0.85 (263 degrees of freedom), using the errors extracted with the spectrum in the original binning. In\naddition we have carried out the goodness command\nwith 10,000 trials, and found that 41% of realizations\nhave a fit statistic better than the best fit. For comparison, the \"ideal\" fit yields 50% of all realizations in\nthe Monte Carlo calculation to be better, i.e., our fit is\nformally acceptable.\nIn Fig. 6 we compare the sum of all campaign-II XRT\nspectra (solid line, see Fig. 5), the observation taken on\nthe first day of campaign III (day 315 in dark shading),\n\n\f7\nTABLE 2\nSpectral Models to XRT spectra of days 71-140.5 and 315\nParam.\nUnit\nValuea\nVAPEC model to Campaign II, combined XRT spectrum\nkT\nkeV . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n0.64 \u00b1 0.06\nNH\n1021 cm\u22122 . . . . . . . . .\n2.7 \u00b1 0.9\nA(N)\nsolarb . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n< 27.9\nA(O)\nsolarb . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n< 1.1\nA(Ne)\nsolarb . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n< 0.9\nA(Mg)\nsolarb . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n0.5 \u00b1 0.3\nA(Si)\nsolarb . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n0.8+1.0\n\u22120.4\nA(S)\nsolarb . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n0.7+1.0\n\u22120.5\nA(Fe)\nsolarb . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n0.2+0.3\n\u22120.1\nfluxc\n10\u221212 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121\n1.15 \u00b1 0.65\nc,d\nLX\n1034 erg s\u22121 . . . . . . .\n2.3 \u00b1 1.3\n...................\n0.85 (263)\n\u03c72red (dof )\nBlackbody (bb) plus VAPEC fit to day 315 spectrum\nNH\n1021 cm\u22122 . . . . . . . . .\n3.1 \u00b1 0.4\nTeff (bb)\neV . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n22.8+9.4\n\u22125.1\nd\n\u22121\nlog(Lbol )\nerg s . . . . . . . . . . . .\n39 \u00b1 2\nradiusd\n103 km . . . . . . . . . . . .\n170+2640\n\u2212161\nkT (VAPEC)\neV . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n0.55\nfluxc (VAPEC) 10\u221212 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121\n0.30 \u00b1 0.15\na 90% uncertainty ranges \u2022 b Anders & Grevesse (1989)\nc Unabsorbed over range 0.25 \u2212 10 keV\nd assuming distance 13 kpc\n\nFig. 6.- XRT spectrum from Fig. 5 in comparison to the observation taken on day 315 (dark gray shading) and the sum of observations taken between days 342.4 and 390 (light gray shading).\nOverplotted is a model consisting of a blackbody and a VAPEC\nwith parameters given in Table 2.\n\nand the sum of the last seven campaign-III observations\n(days 342.4-390 in light shading). From day 140.5 to\n315, the hard component between 0.7 and 1.0 keV has\nfaded, but below 0.5 keV a significantly higher emission\nlevel was observed on day 315. This soft component leads\nto the lower hardness ratio listed in Table 1. After day\n342.4 the hardness ratio is higher again, and the soft\ncomponent is not present in the combined XRT spectrum\nfrom days 342.4-390. However, the hard component has\nnot changed from day 315 to the summed observation of\ndays 342.4-390.\nWe have fitted this soft component with a blackbody.\nIn order to constrain the blackbody fit against arbitrarily high temperatures, we have added a VAPEC model\nwith the abundances fixed at the same values as those\nlisted in Table 2. The best-fit blackbody plus VAPEC\nmodel is shown with a thin solid line in Fig. 6, and the\nresults are given in the lower part of Table 2. The black-\n\nbody temperature is reminiscent of a typical SSS spectrum and the value of NH is consistent with that found\nfrom campaign II. The luminosity range encompasses the\nEddington luminosity of a 1M\u2299 white dwarf, but it is\nnot well constrained owing to the uncertainty in effective\ntemperature and NH . Similarly, the radius derived from\nthe temperature and luminosity is very uncertain and is\nconsistent with an extended white dwarf.\nIn the spectrum taken on day 315, the hard component above 0.6 keV is difficult to model owing to lack of\nsignal. We find a temperature of the VAPEC component\nthat is consistent with that found from the sum of the\ncampaign-II observations (top part of Table 2). The flux\nof the VAPEC component is a factor 3.8 lower than that\nseen in the previous observation on day 315, and the hard\ncomponent has thus faded by this amount. The light\ngray-shaded spectrum shown in Fig. 6 indicates the sum\nof the XRT spectra over days 342.4-390, and there is no\nsignificant difference between the dark- and light shaded\nspectra except for the disappearance of the soft component. This indicates that the hard component evolves\nslowly.\n3. DISCUSSION\n\nThe Classical Nova V458 Vul has been monitored in\nX-rays and the ultraviolet between days 1 and 422 after outburst using the Swift satellite. No X-ray emission\nwas detected 1.2 days after outburst, but the source was\nbright in the UV. The early optical light curve shows two\nstrong peaks on days 4 and 10 after outburst with dramatic changes in line-width velocities (Tarasova 2007).\nSince no X-ray emission was detected three days before\nthe first peak, it is possible that the peaks were in some\nway associated with the trigger for the X-ray emission.\nHowever, no X-ray observations were taken during and\nimmediately after the peaks occurred, and we can not\ndiscuss whether this peculiar behavior is in any way related to the slowly evolving hard X-ray emission. We\nthus encourage systematic monitoring through this evolutionary phase of future nova outbursts in order that\nsuch scenarios can be confirmed or rejected.\nThe second monitoring campaign took place between\ndays 71 and 140.5 after outburst, and a variable, hard\nX-ray source was observed. We have modelled the\ncombined X-ray spectrum and found a good fit with\nan isothermal collision-dominated optically-thin plasma\nmodel. Our model parameters are consistent with the\nspectral model fits to Suzaku spectra obtained on day\n88 after outburst (see Tsujimoto et al. 2008). We find\na chemical composition consistent with a solar mixture,\nexcept for Fe which appears underabundant by a factor\nof at least 2. In CNO-cycled material, nitrogen is expected to be overabundant, however, our data allow us\nonly to derive an upper limit to the N abundance. This\nlimit is high enough that CNO ashes are not ruled out\nfrom the observations. The low Fe abundance might reflect the composition of the post-AGB progenitor star of\nthe white dwarf, and Fe underabundance has been found\nin several other novae as well.\nThe first observation of the third campaign between\n315 and 390 days after outburst shows the first glimpse\nof the SSS phase, but the proper SSS phase does not\nstart until 80 days later (Drake et al. 2008). The soft\ncomponent (0.25\u22120.6 keV) is highly variable with a flare-\n\n\f8\nlike event in X-rays, while the hard component (0.6 \u2212\n10 keV) shows a different pattern of variability.\nWe have searched for the orbital period proposed by\nGoranskij et al. (2008) but found no evidence for it in either X-ray, UV, or optical. Variations seen in the UV are\nin closer relationship to those in the harder X-ray component than in the soft band. During the entire third campaign, the UV brightness is anti-correlated with the hard\nX-ray count rate at the 97-% probability level. The hard\ncomponent during campaign III is a factor 3.8 fainter\nthan during campaign II and can also be modelled with\nan optically-thin plasma spectrum. The signal-to-noise\ndoes not allow us to detect any changes in temperature.\nIf the emission originates from the same plasma as in\ncampaign II, then it has only cooled slightly, and the\nhard component fades extremely slowly. Owing to additional short-term variability within each observing campaign (see Fig. 1), we cannot determine an analytic decay\nlaw.\nThe fourth campaign is dominated by the SSS emission (Drake et al. 2008). At the time of writing, the SSS\nphase has not ended yet, and we postpone the analysis\nof the entire SSS phase. Meanwhile, the hard component\nappears virtually unaffected, which is consistent with expectations that it originates in regions far away from the\nphotosphere of the white dwarf. Our finding of anticorrelations between the hard component and the UV flux\nsuggests that the UV emission originates at least partly\nfrom those outer regions as well. However, the fact that\nthe UV emission also correlates with the SSS emission\n(Drake et al. 2008) suggests that we are seeing a mixture of different UV sources. This may explain why the\ndetection of the anticorrelation between X-ray and UV\nemission during campaign III is so difficult.\nWhile the SSS phase is the most prominent evolutionary phase in X-rays, additional X-ray production mechanisms are poorly understood. While we are not able to\nderive a decay law, it is clear that the hard X-ray component fades over a time scale of more than a year and is\nstill present after the SSS phase started. Since the density in the ejecta must have decreased for the SSS spectrum to emerge, X-ray emission originating from shocks\nwithin the ejecta might be expected to have faded by\nthis time (Lloyd et al. 1992; O'Brien et al. 1994), yielding a shorter time scale than that observed. However,\nit is possible that the emission observed in campaign II\ncould have its origin in internal shocks as discussed by\nTsujimoto et al. (2008). In that case the hard component observed during campaigns III and IV would have\na different origin. On the other hand, Orio et al. (1996)\nstate that they can't be definitive either about their latetime single epoch detection of Pup 1991 coming from internal shocks in the ejecta or from accretion at a high\nrate.\nOther sources of the hard X-ray emission could have\nbeen shock interactions of the expanding ejecta with the\nstellar wind of the companion or with the surrounding\nmedium which includes the innermost regions of the planetary nebula as is suggested for GK Per from direct imaging (see Bode et al. 2004 and references therein; and also\nBalman 2005 and Vrielmann et al. 2005). Shocks with\nthe stellar wind of the companion occur most notably\nin the case of long-period symbiotic novae in which the\nmass-donor star is an evolved object with a massive wind\n\n(e.g., RS Oph: Bode et al. 2006). However, Wesson et al.\n(2008) note that the pre-outburst colors are consistent\nwith an O-type spectral class, and attribute this to either the post-AGB evolution of the PN progenitor, or to\nan accretion disk. It is possible that the more tenuous\ncircumstellar environment of this system still provides for\nsignificant shock-induced X-rays. The timescale for dissipation of the explosion energy in such a tenuous medium\nwould also be much longer than in the denser wind of\nthe symbiotic case.\n4. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe four observing campaigns can be summarized as\nfollows:\n\u2022 The early evolution, before day 70 after outburst,\nshowed an erratic optical light curve (Tarasova\n2007), but we have only one X-ray observation on\nday 1.2 that yields a non-detection. This nondetection suggests that the hard X-ray component\nhas not started its evolution with the outburst directly. The two peaks in the optical light curve on\ndays 4 and 10 after outburst could be related to the\ntrigger for the X-ray emission. For example, X-ray\nand optical emission could have been produced on\nimpact of the expanding ejecta with denser regions\nof the ambient medium, possible related to the proposed planetary nebula. However, in order to test\nsuch scenarios, denser coverage in X-rays during\nthe early evolution is needed.\n\u2022 The first X-ray detection on day 71 after outburst\nis not an SSS spectrum, but a hard component that\ncontinues to increase until \u223cday 100 after outburst.\nThe X-ray spectrum is consistent with collisional\nplasma, yielding typical nova abundances. The Xray light curve is variable during the second campaign from day 71-140.5.\n\u2022 The third campaign, starting on day 315 after outburst, shows a first appearance of a SSS component, but this component disappears again, and is\nnot observed again until day 397 after outburst.\nWe see a suggestion of an anticorrelation between\nthe hard component and the UV emission, which\nwould indicate that the UV emission may at least\npartially originate from the same outer regions as\nthe hard X-ray emission.\n\u2022 The fourth campaign contains a bright SSS component that is not analyzed in this paper. The hard\nX-ray component is still present, suggesting that\nit is unaffected by the SSS component, and that it\nfades extremely slowly. If the UV flux is anticorrelated to the SSS component and to the hard X-ray\ncomponent (see above) then the observed UV flux\noriginates from the photosphere around the white\ndwarf and from the outer regions at the same time.\nWe have discussed several production mechanisms for\nthe hard X-ray component. For internal shocks within\nthe ejecta we expect a shorter decay time than observed (Lloyd et al. 1992; O'Brien et al. 1994), however,\nit is possible that the earlier hard X-ray emission (before day 140) could have originated from within the\n\n\f9\nejecta (Tsujimoto et al. 2008). Detectable emission from\nshocks arising from ejecta interaction with a stellar wind\nwould require a red giant secondary as in symbiotic novae. If this nova occurred within a planetary nebula as\nsuggested by Wesson et al. (2008), then the interaction\nof the nova ejecta with the innermost regions of material\nassociated with the ejection of the PN may be the most\nplausible source of the long-lasting hard X-ray emission.\nWe thank the Swift PI Neil Gehrels and Swift schedulers for their support of these TOO observations.
