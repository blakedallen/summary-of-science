Experiments with gold-gold collisions at RHIC have revealed (i)\nstronger suppression of charmonium production at forward rapidity than at\nmidrapidity and (ii) the similarity between the suppression degrees at RHIC and\nSPS energies. To describe these findings we employ the model that includes\nnuclear shadowing effects, calculated within the Glauber-Gribov theory, rapiditydependent absorptive mechanism, caused by energy-momentum conservation, and\ndissociation and recombination of the charmonium due to interaction with comoving matter. The free parameters of the model are tuned and fixed by\ncomparison with experimental data at lower energies. A good agreement with\nthe RHIC results concerning the rapidity and centrality distributions is obtained\nfor both heavy Au+Au and light Cu+Cu colliding system. For pA and A+A\ncollisions at LHC the model predicts stronger suppression of the charmonium and\nbottomonium yields in stark contrast to thermal model predictions.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe investigation of nuclear matter under extreme temperatures and densities, and\nthe search for a predicted transition to a deconfined phase of quarks and gluons, the socalled Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), is one of the main goals of heavy-ion experiments\nat ultrarelativistic energies. Both theorists and experimentalists are looking for\ngenuine QGP fingerprints, that cannot be masked or washed out by processes on\na hadronic level. Charmonium was proposed about two decades ago [1] as one of the\nmost promising QGP messengers because its yield would be significantly suppressed\ndue to color Debye screening in the plasma phase. Also, due to the small interaction\ncross section of J/\u03c8 in hadronic matter, charmonium spectrum is expected to carry\ninformation about the early hot and dense stage of nuclear collision. Since the volume\nof the produced QGP depends on the collision energy, centrality and mass of colliding\nnuclei, it is generally believed that the suppression of the J/\u03c8 yield would increase\nwith rise of the aforementioned factors.\nTherefore, the PHENIX measurement\nof the nuclear modification factor of\n\u221a\ncharmonium at top RHIC energy s = 200 AGeV [2] uncovered at least two\nunexpected features. Firstly, compared to charmonium suppression in lead-lead\n\n\fResolving the J/\u03c8 RHIC puzzles at LHC\n\n2\n\ncollisions at SPS energy Elab = 160 AGeV [3] the level of suppression at midrapidity\nat RHIC was found to be quite similar for the same number of participants despite\nthe order of magnitude difference in center-of-mass energies of heavy-ion collisions.\nSecondly, J/\u03c8 suppression increases unambiguously with rising rapidity, whereas the\nhighest energy density and the most dense medium should be produced at y = 0.\nThese findings, as well as the experimental results for dAu collisions, where the plasma\nformation is very unlikely, attract the attention to the whole variety of the processes,\nincluding both initial and final state effects, that are responsible for the charmonium\nproduction and its propagation through hot and dense medium.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a description of the model\nthat contains a comprehensive treatment of initial-state nuclear effects, such as nuclear\nshadowing and nuclear absorption, and final state interactions with the co-moving\nmatter. Comparison with the available experimental data and predictions for P b + P b\ncollisions at LHC energy is given in Sec. 3. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Sec. 4.\n2. Description of the model\nNuclear effects in nucleus-nucleus collisions are usually expressed through the so-called\nJ/\u03c8\nnuclear modification factor, RAB (b), defined as the ratio of the J/\u03c8 yield in A+A and\npp scaled by the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions, n(b). We have then\nJ/\u03c8\n\nRAB (b) =\n\nJ/\u03c8\n\ndNAB /dy\nJ/\u03c8\n\nn(b) dNpp /dy\nR 2\nsh\nd s \u03c3AB (b) n(b, s) SJ/\u03c8\n(b, s) S abs (b, s) S co (b, s)\nR 2\n=\n.\n(1)\nd s \u03c3AB (b) n(b, s)\nR\nHere \u03c3AB (b) = 1 \u2212 exp[\u2212\u03c3pp AB TAB (b)], TAB (b) = d2 sTA (s)TB (b \u2212 s) is the nuclear\noverlapping function, TA (b) is obtained from Woods-Saxon nuclear densities, and\nn(b, s) = \u03c3pp AB TA (s) TB (b \u2212 s)/\u03c3AB (b) ,\n\n(2)\n\n2\n\nwhere upon integration over d s we obtain the number of binary nucleon-nucleon\ncollisions at impact parameter b, n(b). The three additional factors in the numerator\nof Eq. (1), S sh , S abs and S co , denote the effects of shadowing, nuclear absorption, and\ninteraction with the co-moving matter, respectively. Let us discuss them briefly.\nThe nuclear absorption is usually interpreted as suppression of J/\u03c8 yield because\nof multiple scattering of a cc\u0304 pair within the nuclear medium. At low energies the\nprimordial spectrum of particles created in scattering off a nucleus is mainly altered by\n(i) interactions with the nuclear matter they traverse on the way out to the detector\nand (ii) energy-momentum conservation. For A+A collisions these effects can be\ncombined into the generalized suppression factor\n[1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03be(x+ )\u03c3QQ\u0304 ATA (b))]\n2 AB T (s)T (b \u2212 s)\n\u03be(x+ )\u03be(x\u2212 )\u03c3Q\nA\nB\nQ\u0304\n\u00d7 [1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03be(x\u2212 )\u03c3QQ\u0304 BTB (b \u2212 s))] ,\n\nS abs =\n\n(3)\np\n\u03b3\n2\n2\nwhere x\u00b1 = ( xF \u2212 4M /s \u00b1 xF )/2, and \u03be(x\u00b1 ) = (1 \u2212 \u01eb) + \u01ebx\u00b1 determines both\nabsorption and energy-momentum conservation. In [4] it has been found that \u03b3 = 2,\n\u01eb = 0.75 and \u03c3QQ\u0304 = 20 mb give a good description of data. This corresponds to\n\u03c3abs = 5 mb at mid-rapidity and agrees well with other studies.\n\n\fResolving the J/\u03c8 RHIC puzzles at LHC\n\n3\n\nSecondly, coherence effects will lead to nuclear shadowing for both soft and hard\nprocesses at RHIC, and therefore for the production of heavy flavor. Shadowing can\nbe calculated within the Glauber-Gribov theory [5], and we will utilize the generalized\nSchwimmer model of multiple scattering [6]. In this case the second suppression factor\nin Eq. (1) reads\n1\n1\n,\n(4)\nS sh (b, s, y) =\n1 + AF (yA )TA (s) 1 + BF (yB )TB (b \u2212 s)\nwhere the main contribution to the function F (y), that encodes the dynamics of\nshadowing, comes from the gluon rather than from the quark shadowing [7, 8]. At\nSPS energy the nuclear absorption dominates over the shadowing, whereas RHIC\nalready belongs to the high-energy regime. Nuclear shadowing is non-negligible at midrapidity, and the combined effect of shadowing and energy-momentum conservation\nshould be accounted for at forward rapidities. At LHC shadowing will be very strong\neven at y = 0, while energy-momentum conservation becomes a minor effect.\nFinally, the processes of dissociation and recombination of cc\u0304 pairs in the dense\nmedium should be taken into account. We employ the co-movers interaction model\n(CIM) [9] that was recently modified to incorporate the recombination mechanism\ninto consideration [10]. Assuming a pure longitudinal expansion and boost invariance\nof the system, the rate equation which includes both dissociation and recombination\neffects for the density of charmonium at a given production point at impact parameter\ns reads\nh\ndNJ/\u03c8 (b, s, y)\n\u03c4\n(5)\n= \u2212 \u03c3co N co (b, s, y)NJ/\u03c8 (b, s, y)\nd\u03c4\ni\n\u2212 Nc (b, s, y)Nc\u0304 (b, s, y) ,\nwhere N co , NJ/\u03c8 and Nc(c\u0304) is the density of comovers, J/\u03c8 and open charm,\nrespectively, and \u03c3co is the interaction cross section for both dissociation of\ncharmonium with co-movers and regeneration of J/\u03c8 from cc\u0304 pairs in the system\naveraged over the momentum distribution of the participants. It is the constant of\nproportionality for both the dissociation and recombination terms due to detailed\nbalance NJ/\u03c8 (b, s, y) N co(b, s, y) = Nc (b, s, y) Nc\u0304 (b, s, y). The solution of Eq. (5) can\nbe approximated by\nn\n\u0002\nS co (b, s, y) = exp \u2212 \u03c3co N co (b, s, y)\n\u0003 \u0002 N co \u0003o\n\u2212 C(y)Nbin (b, s)S shad (b, s, y) ln\n,\nNpp (0)\nwhere\n\u000e \u00012\ncc\u0304\ndy\nd\u03c3pp\n(6)\nC(y) =\n\u000e .\nJ/\u03c8\nN D d\u03c3\ndy\n\u03c3pp\npp\nDetails of the model can be found in [10]. The quantities in Eq. (6) are all related to\npp collisions at the corresponding energy and are taken from experiment. Note, that\nthe extension of the CIM to the recombination effects does not imply any additional\nparameters.\n3.

The dash-dotted ones are the results without\nrecombination (C = 0). The dashed line is the total initial-state effect. The\ndotted line in the right figure is the result of shadowing. In the left figure the last\ntwo lines coincide.\n\nour model compared to experimental data at mid-rapidity. The different contributions\nto J/\u03c8 suppression are shown. Note that at mid-rapidities the initial-state effect is\njust the shadowing. As discussed above nuclear absorption due to energy-momentum\nconservation is present at forward rapidities but is negligibly small at mid-rapidities.\nOne can see that the J/\u03c8 suppression at forward rapidity is somewhat larger than\nthat at mid-rapidities, in full accord with experimental data. This is due to both the\nrecombination term and the initial-state effects. The latter are stronger for forward\nrapidities.\nFor consistency, we have also made calculations for the J/\u03c8 suppression in\nCu+Cu collisions at RHIC using the same parameters as above for Au+Au collisions.\nThe results are shown in Fig. 2, and are in good agreement with the experimental\ndata, except maybe for peripheral collisions, where the error bars are quite large.\nConcluding, our procedure gives a reasonable description of data both at mid- and\nforward rapidity for different collision systems at RHIC. The effect of recombination\nis more pronounced at midrapidity.\nBased on our previous discussion, it is obvious that dissociation-recombination\n\u221a\neffects will be of crucial importance in Pb+Pb collisions at LHC ( s = 5.5 TeV).\nAssuming that the energy dependence of open charm and J/\u03c8 in pp collisions is the\nsame (between RHIC and LHC energies), the energy dependence of the parameter\ncc\u0304\nC will be that of \u03c3pp\n/\u03c3pp . The total and differential cross section for charm can be\ncalculated using perturbative techniques [13]. The calculations for low energies are in\nagreement with data, yet predictions for RHIC and Tevatron energies are lower than\nthe data. Therefore, the extrapolation to LHC is quite uncertain. If we parameterize\nthe energy dependence of open charm production as \u03c3 cc\u0304 \u221d s\u03b1 , with \u03b1 = 0.3 and use\nthe values of non-diffractive \u03c3pp as 34 mb for RHIC and 59 mb for LHC, we obtain\nC = 2.5 at LHC \u2013 a value about four times larger than the corresponding one at\n\n\f1.4\n\nshadowing\n+ dissociation\n+ recombination\n\n1.2\n\ne+e- PHENIX (|y|<0.35)\n\n5\n\nRCu+Cu\n\nRCu+Cu\n\nResolving the J/\u03c8 RHIC puzzles at LHC\n\n1.4\n\n1.2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\nshadowing\n+ absorption\n+ dissociation\n+ recombination\n\n80\n\n100\n\n0\n\nNpart\n\n0\n\n\u03bc +\u03bc - PHENIX (|y|\u2208[1.2,2.2])\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nNpart\n\n\u221a\nFigure 2.

In view of that we consider that realistic values of C at LHC are of the range\n2 to 3. In Fig. 3(a) we have calculated the J/\u03c8 suppression at LHC for several values\nof C, including the case of absence of recombination effects (C = 0). Although the\ndensity of charm grows substantially from RHIC to LHC, the combined effect of initialstate shadowing and comovers dissociation appears to overcome the effect of parton\nrecombination. This is in sharp contrast with the findings of [14], where a strong\nenhancement of the J/\u03c8 yield with increasing centrality was predicted. Note that in\nour approach only comovers and open charm produced at the same impact parameter\nas the initial J/\u03c8 are allowed to interact, whereas models assuming global equilibrium\nof the produced charm with the medium allow for recombination of cc\u0304 pairs from the\nwhole volume of the fireball.\nFinally, we would like to discuss the impact of initial state effects on bottomonium\nproduction. The absorptive cross section for \u03a5 is 40-50% smaller than that for J/\u03c8\nand \u03c8 \u2032 , and energy-momentum conservation mechanisms are pushed to higher xF\ndue to the large mass of the bottomonium. Therefore, nuclear absorption for \u03a5 at\nLHC is expected to be quite small. The suppression of bottomonium due to gluon\nshadowing in Pb+Pb collisions at LHC is shown in Fig. 3(b) for several rapidities.\nThe suppression is about 50% from mid-central to central collisions, and would be\nthe same for all members of the \u03a5 family. This establishes the baseline for further\ncalculations of bottomonium dissociation and recombination in the final state.\n4. Conclusions\nThe effects of recombination of cc\u0304 pairs into J/\u03c8 are incorporated in the comovers\ninteraction model. These effects are negligible at low energies (SPS) due to the low\ndensity of open charm. The model does not assume thermal equilibrium of the matter\nproduced in the collision and includes a comprehensive treatment of initial-state\neffects, such as shadowing, nuclear absorption and energy-momentum conservation.\n\n\f1.4\n\nshadowing\nC = 0 - no recombination\nC=2\nC = 3.5\nC=5\n\n1.2\n\n6\n\nRPbPb\n\nRPb+Pb\n\nResolving the J/\u03c8 RHIC puzzles at LHC\n\n1\n\n\u03a5\n0.8\n\ny=0\ny = 2.2\ny = 3.5\n\n1\n\ns = 5500 GeV\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.4\n0.2\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100 150 200 250\n\n300 350 400\n\nNpart\n\n0\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100 150 200 250\n\n300 350 400\nNpart\n\n\u221a\nFigure 3.

Using it as an input, the centrality and\nrapidity dependence of experimental data is reproduced both for Au+Au and Cu+Cu\ncollisions at full RHIC energy. For LHC we are lacking the experimental information\nand should rely on estimates from theoretical models. For a reasonable choice of\nparameters, we predict that the suppression observed at RHIC and lower energies\nwill still dominate over the recombination effects. This is due to the large density of\ncomovers and to the strong initial-state suppression at these ultra-relativistic energies.\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n\nMatsui T, Satz H 1986 Phys.
