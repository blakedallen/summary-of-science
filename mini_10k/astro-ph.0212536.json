In the currently\nfavored models the \u03b3-ray emission is attributed to radiation from shock-accelerated electrons in the relativistic\nfireball outflow or jet from a cataclysmic stellar event.\nThe latter may be connected to compact stellar mergers, or the core collapse of a massive stellar progenitor\n(collapsar), which could also involve a core-collapse supernova (SN) [1]. Together with electrons, the shocks are\nexpected to accelerate protons as well, and high energy\nneutrinos are thought to be produced dominantly by p\u03b3\ninteractions of the protons with synchrotron or inverse\nCompton scattered photons [2, 3]. Recent reports of detection of X-ray lines from several GRB afterglows have\nbeen interpreted [4], although not unambiguously, as providing support for a version of the collapsar model in\nwhich a SN explosion occurs weeks before the GRB (the\n\"supranova\" model, [5]). In the supranova scenario the\nsupernova remnant (SNR) shell provides nucleon targets\nfor pp interactions with protons accelerated in the MHD\nwind of a pre-GRB pulsar [6], leading to a 10 TeV neutrino precursor to the GRB (other nucleon targets from\na stellar companion disruption leading to \u03c0 0 decay GeV\n\u03b3-rays were discussed by [7]). The SNR also provides\nadditional target photons for p\u03b3 interactions [6] with internal shock-accelerated protons, resulting in \u223c 1016 eV\nneutrinos. In this Letter we investigate some important\nunexplored aspects of the GRB-SNR interaction, namely\npp and p\u03b3 interactions involving GRB protons in the\nshocked shell, which have significant consequences in the\nassessment of the neutrino signatures from these objects.\nSNR target nucleons and photons.- The typical mass\nejected in a SN is Msnr \u223c msnr M\u2299 = 2 \u00d7 1033 msnr g.

Besides ejecting the SNR envelope, the SN explosion may\nleave behind parts of the He core, which take longer in\nfalling back to make a black hole leading to the GRB\n(months in the supranova scenario). If the fall-back is\nanisotropic and a channel forms in the He core (e.g.\nalong the rotation axis), the relativistic MHD wind may\nflow out and impact the SNR shell further out. The\nMHD wind is highly relativistic, and is decelerated to\na subrelativistic velocity in a reverse shock, driving a\nforward shock into the shell [9]. The shock velocity vs\nin the observer frame satisfies, from pressure balance in\nthe shock frame, vs \u2212 v \u2243 [Lm (10\u22121 R/c)/Msnr]1/2 \u2243\n10\u22121 [E(t)/Msnr ]1/2 \u223c 10\u22122 c for typical E(t) = tLm\nand Msnr . Thus the shock will propagate through a\nsignificant fraction of the shell width, and we approximate the situation by taking the shock to cross the entire shell, producing photons distributed throughout the\nshell. Given the high Thomson optical depth in the SNR\nshell, these photons thermalize to a maximum energy\n1/4 1/4 \u22123/4 \u22121/2\ntd\nkeV, assuming that all\n\u01eb\u03b3,m \u223c 0.1 Lm46\u03b4\u22121 v9\nthe MHD wind energy goes into photons.

However, even\nif they have super-Eddington luminosities L\u2217,He \u223c 1044\nerg/s as inferred in some SN, these photons have an optical depth \u03c4p\u03b3 \u223c 5L44 v9\u22122 t\u22121\nfor protons with Ep &\nd\n3 \u00d7 108 td GeV, negligible compared to Eqs. (1) and (2).\nThe non-relativistic MHD forward shock moving into\nthe SNR is likely to be collisionless (as also generally\nassumed for non-relativistic GRB internal shocks [10]).\nThe transition is dominated by the process giving the\nnarrower shock width, i.e. the shortest timescales for\nchanging particle momenta. A collisionless shock thickness is \u223c c/(\u03b2\u03c9p ), where \u03b2 is shock velocity, \u03c9p is plasma\nion frequency. For our parameters \u223c 1 M\u2299 shell at\n\u223c 1014 cm radius, \u03c9p = 3 \u00d7 1010 /sec and \u03b2 = 0.01,\nthis shock width is 100 cm. The thickness of a radiation\nshock is l/\u03b2, where l is the photon mean free path, giving\na thickness \u223c 1011 cm. The thickness for pp collisions is\neven larger due to a smaller cross section than Thomson.\nThis strongly suggests that the shock is collisionless.\nThe average magnetic field inside the SNR shell is\n1/2\n\n\u22121/2 \u22121/2 \u22123/2\ntd\n\nB \u223c 104 \u03beB m1/2\nsnr \u03b4\u22121 v9\n\nG,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03beB is the equipartition value in respect to the\nproton kinetic energy.

However, since\ninternal shock radii range over 3 \u00d7 1012 \u2212 3 \u00d7 1014 cm,\nthis may allow a significant fraction of . 1016 eV protons to interact with the SNR shell.

If \u03besh (typically . 10\u22121 ) is the fraction of shell\nprotons which is accelerated to relativistic energies by the\ncollisionless MHD shock going through the SNR shell,\nthe column density of cold protons in the SNR shell is\n\u22122\n\u03a3p \u223c 1028 \u03b6sh msnr v9\u22122 t\u22122\n, where \u03b6sh = 1 \u2212 \u03besh \u223c 1.\nd cm\nThe total cross-section for pp interaction has\n\u221a been measured up to very high energies (120 mb at s = 30 TeV\n[11]) in accelerator experiments. We take the mean pp\ncross-section to be <\u03c3pp>\u2248 100 mb in the TeV and above\nenergy range. The corresponding mean optical depth is\n<\u03c4pp>= \u03a3 <\u03c3pp>\u2248 103 \u03b6sh msnr v9\u22122 t\u22122\nd .\n\n(5)\n\nTo calculate the neutrino flux from pp interactions, one\nneeds to know the secondary\ncharged particle multiplici\u221a\nties as a function of s. Analytic calculations of this multiplicity, known as the KNO scaling law [12], are based on\nthe rapidity (y = ln[(E+pz )/(E\u2212pz )]/2, taking the beam\ndirection along the z-axis) distribution of the secondary\ncharged particles. Analytically the total charged particle\nmultiplicity increases as \u223c ln(s). Accelerator data show\na slightly\nfaster growth in pp interactions measured\nup\n\u221a\n\u221a\nto s = 1.8 TeV [13]. An extrapolation up to s \u223c 400\nTeV, relevant for our calculation, for \u03c0 \u00b1 and K \u00b1 multiplicities from pp interactions using \u223c ln(s) scaling is\ncertainly very conservative. There exist in the literature\nother faster growing models such as \u223c s0.3 [14]. The\ndominant neutrino production channels in our calculation are pp \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 /K \u00b1 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bc \u2192 e\u03bde \u03bd\u03bc \u03bd\u0304\u03bc . High energy\nphotons are also produced from \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3.\nWe used the PYTHIA 6.2 event generator [15] to simulate pp interactions [16]. The angular deviation of a\nsecondary particle is related to its Lorentz invariant rapidity (y) as \u03b8 \u2248 1/ cosh(y). We select \u03c0 \u00b1 and K \u00b1 which\nare forward, namely, y \u2265 \u221a\n0. The average \u03c0 \u00b1 and K \u00b1\nmultiplicities measured at s = 540 GeV in the pseudorapidity (\u03b7 \u2248 y for momentum p \u226b m) region 0 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 5\nare <n\u03c0>= 11.15 and <nK >= 1.25 [13]. These numbers\n\n\f3\nagree with our PYTHIA simulations within error bars.\nFor\n\u221a y \u2265 0 we have < n\u03c0 >= 15.3 and < nK >= 1.7 at\ns = 540 GeV from\nenergy,\n\u221a simulations. At the highest\n\u221a\nEp = 1020 eV ( s = 4.33 \u00d7 105 GeV), ln( s) extrapolation gives < n\u03c0 >= 15.3 \u00d7 ln(4.33 \u00d7 105 /540) \u2248 103,\nabout 75% of our simulated value of 136. Similarly\n< nK >= 1.7 \u00d7 ln(4.33 \u00d7 105 /540) \u2248 11.4, also about\n75% of our simulated value of 15.2 at Ep = 1020 eV.\nFor our calculation we used more conservative values:\n20\n< n\u221a\neV and\n\u03c0 >= 103 and < nK >= 11.4 at Ep = 10\nln( s) scaling at lower energies.\nSecondary charged particles (\u03c0 \u00b1 and K \u00b1 ) in the pp\ninteraction follow a 1/E energy distribution [16]. The\nenergy of a particle of mass m ranges from m cosh(y)\u03b3cm ,\nwhere \u03b3cm is the Lorentz boost of the center of mass in\nthe lab frame and cosh(y) is the rapidity dependent boost\nfactor, up to the primary proton energy Ep . For y \u2265 0\nwe use for secondary \u03c0 \u00b1 and K \u00b1 the range\n\u03b3cm m\u03c0, K \u2264 E\u03c0, K .

The normalization\nfactors N\u03c0 and NK are found by integrating the 1/E distribution of \u03c0 \u00b1 and K \u00b1 in the energy range given in Eq.\nmx\n(6) for E\u03c0,K\n\u2248 1011 GeV and equating to the respective total numbers, N\u03c0 =<n\u03c0 > /ln (E\u03c0mx /m\u03c0 \u03b3cm ) \u2248 7,\nmx\nNK = 0.64 <nK > /ln (EK\n/mK \u03b3cm ) \u2248 0.6.\nAn additional pp component may result from protons\naccelerated by the collisionless shock in the shell colliding with shell thermal nucleons. For a typical SNR\nshell energy 1051 E51 ergs this neutrino component has\n. \u03b6sh 1051 E51 ergs, at least an order of magnitude below\nthe GRB shock proton component, but it could become\nimportant for exceptionally energetic supernova shells.\nNeutrino flux calculation.- The GRB protons from\ninternal shocks undergo pp interactions below Ep,th from\nEqs.

Here fpp = min(1, < \u03c4pp >) from Eq.\n(5), and f\u03c0 is the fraction of Ep lost to \u03c0's in p\u03b3 interactions [2], which is \u223c 1 for an SNR with \u03c4p\u03b3 \u226b 1.\nThe synchrotron cooling energy E\u03bds is found by equating\nthe decay times (\u03c4j \u03b3j with j = \u03c0, K, \u03bc) and synchrotron\ncooling times for \u03c0's, K's and \u03bc's. For the magnetic field\nin Eq.

The corresponding \u03bd steepening break\nenergies are & 109 GeV.

Figure\n1 shows the diffuse \u03bd\u03bc energy flux per decade (same for \u03bde\nand \u03bd\u0304\u03bc ) from GRB models with pre-ejected SNR shells.\nWe assumed \u223c 10\u22121 of protons escape the fireball shocks\nto reach the shell, where fpp = 1 and E\u03bds = 109 GeV.\nThe top curve is calculated assuming all the GRBs have\na SNR shell. This is an upper limit for maximum \u03bd's\nthrough pp and p\u03b3 interactions in the SNR shell. The\nbottom curve assumes 10% of the GRBs have an SNR\nshell. Also shown are the diffuse \u03bd-fluxes from p\u03b3 interactions in the internal shocks of bursts (WB [2], short\ndashed curve), and in GRB afterglows ([3], short dashed\ncurve), as well as the \u03bd-flux obtained from the cosmic ray\nlimits (WB Limit [17], long dashed straight lines). In a\nkm2 detector [18], the number of diffuse events assuming 10% of GRBs have SNR shells is \u223c 6 yr\u22121 sr\u22121 at\nTeV-PeV, and \u223c 0.3 yr\u22121 sr\u22121 in the PeV-EeV range.\nDiscussion and Implications.- The single-burst \u03bdfluxes calculated here are predicated on the existence of\n\n\f4\nsame GRB-contemporaneous internal shock protons interacting with thermal 0.1 keV photons within the shell\nwall, whereas [6] consider such protons interacting with\nphotons from the MHD wind inside the shell cavity.\n\nE 2\u03bd \u03a6\u03bd [log10(GeV/cm2 s sr)]\n\n-7\nWB Limit\n\n-8\nSupranova\n\nThe pre-ejected supernova (supranova) model of GRB\nis a subject of interest and debate [10] for interpreting\nthe \u03b3- and X-ray data, and independent tests would be\nuseful. The neutrino fluxes discussed here provide such\na test, the predicted event rates being detectable with\nkilometer scale planned Cherenkov detectors.\n\n-9\nBurst\n\n-10\n\n-11\n\nAfterglow\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nE \u03bd [log10(GeV)]\n\nFIG. 1: Diffuse neutrino flux (E\u03bd2 \u03a6\u03bd ) from post-supernova\n(supranova) models of GRBs (solid curves), assuming that\n(top curve) all GRBs have an SNR shell, or (bottom) 10%\nof all GRBs have an SNR shell, and 10\u22121 of the fireball protons reach the shells. Long dashed lines correspond to the\nWaxman-Bahcall cosmic-ray limit, short dashed curves are\nthe diffuse \u03bd flux from GRB internal shocks and afterglows.\n\na pre-ejected SNR shell by the progenitor of the GRB,\nwhich occurs at the same location after a delay of weeks\n[5]. The \u03bd's produced by pp and p\u03b3 interactions between\nGRB relativistic protons and SNR shell target protons\nand photons will be contemporary and of similar duration\nas the GRB electromagnetic event. The high pp optical\ndepth of the shell also implies a moderately high average\nThomson optical depth \u03c4T \u221d td\u22122 of the shell, dropping\nbelow unity after \u223c 100 d. Large scale anisotropy as\nwell as clumpiness of the shell will result in a mixture of\nhigher and lower optical depth regions being observable\nsimultaneously, as required in the supranova interpretation of X-ray lines and photon continua in some GRB\nafterglows [4]. Depending on the fraction of GRB with\nSNR shells, the contributions of these to the GRB diffuse\n\u03bd-flux has a pp component which is relatively stronger at\nTeV-PeV energies than the internal shock p\u03b3 component\nof [2], and a shell p\u03b3 component which is a factor 1 (0.1)\nof the internal shock p\u03b3 component (Fig. 1) for a fraction 1 (0.1) of GRB with SNR shells. Due to a higher\nsynchrotron cooling break in the shell, at E\u03bd & 1017 eV\nthe shell component could compete with the internal [2]\nand afterglow [3] components.\nOur pp component is caused by internal shockaccelerated power-law protons contemporaneous with the\nGRB event, differing from [6] who considered quasimonoenergetic \u03b3p \u223c 104.5 protons from an MHD wind\nover 4\u03c0 leading to a \u223c 10 TeV neutrino months-long precursor of the GRB.
