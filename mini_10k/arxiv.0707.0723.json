In lightweight nuclei, it is known that clustering plays a significant role in the features of ground and excited states\n[1, 2]. On the other hand, in heavier nuclei, the clustering effects are not clear, though many theoretical [3, 4]\nand experimental [5] studies have been conducted. In\nthe f p-shell region, the focus should be on proton-rich\nN \u223c Z nuclei, because such nuclei can have a clustered\nstructure comprising stable nucleus. Moreover, protonrich nuclei have a large radius and stronger Coulomb repulsion, and may also derive a cluster structure. In the\nscope of this research, the features of cluster structures\nin 40 Ca are a key issue, because they are the heaviest\nN = Z stable nuclei, and many experimental data exist for this nuclei. In this paper, we have studied the\nstructure of 40 Ca as a starting point to understand the\nstructures of medium- and heavy-weight N \u223c Z nuclei.\n40\nCa has a typical double closed-shell structure nucleus\nand has a spherical ground state. However, it is known\nthat many kinds of deformed band appear in low energy\nregions. The first K \u03c0 = 0+ band built on the J \u03c0 = 0+\n2\nstate (3.35 MeV) is considered to be a normal-deformed\n(ND) state and the dominant configuration is 4p-4h [6].\nThe K \u03c0 = 2+ band built on J \u03c0 = 2+\n2 (5.25 MeV) exists\njust above the K \u03c0 = 0+ band. It has been suggested that\nthe ND band deforms triaxially and has the K \u03c0 = 2+ side\nband due to triaxiality [7, 8].\nThe \u03b1-36 Ar cluster structure has been studied for a\nlong time, because 40 Ca is an analogue of 16 O, which has\nan \u03b1-12 C cluster structure in the first K \u03c0 = 0+ band, as\na double closed-shell nuclei. The local potential model\n[9, 10, 11] and \u03b1-36 Ar orthogonal condition model (OCM)\n[12, 13] have been performed theoretically. Ohkubo et\nal. suggested that the first K \u03c0 = 0+ band (ND) has an\n\u03b1-36 Ar structure, and predicted that its parity-doublet\n\nK \u03c0 = 0\u2212 band and \u03b1-36 Ar higher nodal band exist in\nhighly excited states [10]. Sakuda et al. obtained the\nK \u03c0 = 2+ band as well as the K \u03c0 = 0+ and 0\u2212 states\nusing the \u03b1-36 Ar OCM, and succeeded in reproducing\nE2 transition strengths [13]. Experimentally, the \u03b1-36 Ar\nstructure is studied through the 36 Ar(6 Li,d)40 Ca reaction [14, 15]. The states in these K \u03c0 = 0+ and 0\u2212 bands\nare populated by the \u03b1-transfer reactions and have large\n\u03b1 spectroscopic factors [14]. In the experiments we describe, the \u03b1-36 Ar higher-nodal states were also observed\n[15].\nIt has been suggested that the states in the K \u03c0 = 0+\nrotational band built on the J \u03c0 = 0+\n3 state (5.21 MeV)\nhave a 8p-8h configuration [7], and have been observed\nduring experimental work searching for the 8p-8h states\nwith 32 S(12 C, \u03b1)40 Ca reactions [16]. Due to the strong\npopulation in the multi-nucleon transfer data and the\nstrong E2 transitions [17], the 0+ (5.21 MeV), 2+ (5.63\nMeV) and 4+ (6.54 MeV) bands have been thought to\nbelong to the superdeformed (SD) band with the dominant 8p-8h configuration. Recently, by using GAMMASPHERE array detectors, the level structure of the deformed bands in 40 Ca has been explored and many excited states up to high spin have been discovered. This\nband was thus confirmed as the SD band [18].\nMotivated by these the experimental observations,\nmany theoretical microscopic studies on deformed states\nof 40 Ca have been performed recently with the methods\nof Skyrme-Hartree-Fock (SHF) [19], SHF-BCS + GCM\n[20], spherical-basis AMD [21] and the shell model [22].\nInakura et al. performed cranked SHF calculations without assuming axial symmetry, though energy levels were\nnot calculated [19]. Bender et al. performed SHF-BCS +\nGCM calculations [20]. Although they calculated energy\nlevels and quadrupole transition strengths in the ND and\nSD bands, they could not study triaxiality nor side bands\nbecause they assumed axial symmetry. In these studies, the relationship between deformed states and clus-\n\n\f2\nter structure was not discussed. It has been suggested\nthat the SD state forms a 12 C-28 Si-like cluster structure\nin spherical-basis AMD [21]. Within the spherical-basis\nAMD, triaxiality does not appear in ND nor SD states.\nThe purpose of the present study is to understand the\nclustering and triaxial deformations in the low energy\nstates of 40 Ca in a unified manner. We use the framework of AMD + GCM. The basis functions of GCM are\nobtained by energy variation after parity projection with\nconstraints. We adopted two kinds of constraints. One is\na constraint on the quadrupole deformation parameter \u03b2\n(\u03b2-constraint) and the other is on the distance d between\nclusters' centers of mass (d-constraint). It has already\nbeen proven that the d-constraint is useful for obtaining\nvarious kinds of clustering wave function, which are not\ncomputed within a simple \u03b2-constraint [23]. For example, the 8 Be(2\u03b1)-12 C cluster structure in 20 Ne is calculated with a d-constraint but not with the \u03b2-constraint.\nAlso in the case of 40 Ca, many kinds of cluster structure, for example \u03b1-36 Ar, 8 Be(2\u03b1)-32 S and 12 C-28 Si, can\nbe calculated with the d-constraint, although no cluster\nstructure is obtained in 40 Ca with the \u03b2-constraint. We\nsuperposed mean-field-type and cluster-type wave functions calculated with \u03b2- and d-constraints respectively,\nand calculated energies and E2 transition strength. We\nanalyzed the superposed wave functions in order to investigate clustering and triaxial deformations.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In the next section\n(\u00a7II), we explain the framework of this study. The calculated results and discussions are presented in \u00a7III, and\nlastly, we present a summary in \u00a7IV.\nII.\nA.\n\n|\u03a6\u03c0 i =\n\nWave Function and Hamiltonian\n\nWe used the theoretical framework of AMD + GCM.\nIn the present study, the AMD wave function is a Slater\ndeterminant of triaxially deformed Gaussian wave packets (deformed-basis AMD),\n|\u03a6int i = \u00c2|\u03c61 , \u03c62 , * * * , \u03c6A i,\n(1a)\n|\u03c6i i = |\u03c6i , \u03c7i , \u03c4i i,\n(1b)\n\"\n1\n\u00132 #\n\u0012\nY \u0012 2\u03bd\u03c3 \u0013 4\nZi\u03c3\nhr|\u03c6i i =\n,\nexp \u2212\u03bd\u03c3 r\u03c3 \u2212 \u221a\n\u03c0\n\u03bd\u03c3\n\u03c3=x,y,z\n(1c)\n(1d)\n(1e)\n\nHere, the complex parameters Zi , which represent the\ncentroids of the Gaussian in phase space, take independent values for each single particle wave function.

By applying the \u03b2-constraint we obtained energy curves for D1S\n(solid line) and SLy7 (dotted line). Both forces give quite\nsimilar curves that have three local minima or shoulders\nat \u03b2 \u223c 0, 0.4 and 0.6. As shown in Table. I, they also give\napproximately the same kinetic and potential energies\naround each minimum. Therefore, we mainly discuss the\nD1S result and make some comments on the differences\nbetween D1S and SLy7 below. The lowest minimum at\n\u03b2=0 corresponds to the spherical ground state and the\ntwo minima at \u03b2 \u223c 0.4 and 0.6 correspond to the ND\nand SD states respectively. The excitation energies of\nthe ND and SD minima are approximately 14 MeV and\n18 MeV. This result qualitatively agrees with the constrained SHF calculation using SLy4 [19]. On the other\nhand, the energy curve in the constrained SHF-BCS calculation with SLy6 [20] reveals different behavior. It does\nnot have the ND minimum nor shoulder, but has a SD\nminimum.

This\ndifference may be due to the strong pairing correlation\nreported in Ref. 20.\nIn the present calculation, we do not make any assumptions regarding the spatial symmetry of the wave function\nnor put any constraints on the quadrupole deformation \u03b3.\n\u03b3 therefore has the optimal value for each given value of\n\u03b2. Figure 1 (b) shows the projection of the energy curve\nonto the \u03b2-\u03b3 plane. It shows that in most regions the system is triaxially deformed and the degree of the triaxial\ndeformation greatly changes as a function of \u03b2. Starting from the spherical ground state, the system rapidly\nchanges to oblate deformation around \u03b2=0.15-0.25 via a\nsmall prolate deformation. Then, it changes to triaxial\ndeformation around \u03b2=0.35 where the ND minimum appears and the system has the largest triaxiality. With a\nfurther increase of \u03b2, \u03b3 decreases gradually from \u03b3=30\u25e6\nat \u03b2=0.35 to \u03b3=15\u25e6 at \u03b2=0.70. The SD minimum that\nappears at \u03b2=0.60 also has a large triaxial deformation\n\u03b3=15\u25e6.\n\nFIG. 2: Density distributions of the ND and SD minima obtained using the \u03b2-constraint. The crosses in the figure show\nthe centroids of the wave packets. The deformation parameters are (\u03b2, \u03b3) = (0.39, 25.2\u25e6 ) and (0.62, 14.5\u25e6 ) for the ND\nand SD minima, respectively.\n\nThe deformation of the \u03b2-\u03b3 curve for SLy7 shows similar behavior except in the region of \u03b2=0.15-0.30. In the\n\u03b2 \u223c 0.30 region, the deformation obtained for SLy7 is\ntriaxial, which is different from the oblate deformation\nwith D1S. The wave functions in this region did not affect the ND and SD bands, nor their side bands as shown\nlater.\nFigure 2 shows the density distribution of the ND and\nSD minima, and confirms their large triaxial deformation. It also reveals the deformed mean-field nature of\nthe ND minimum and implies the existence of a relationship between the SD minimum and the cluster structure. At the limit when all Zi \u2192 0 (all centroids of\nsingle particle wave packets go to the origin of the coordinate frame), the AMD wave function is identical to\nan eigenstate of the deformed harmonic oscillator whose\noscillation number is given by the relation \u03c9\u03c3 =2~\u03bd\u03c3 /M .\nIn contrast, when the system has a cluster-like structure, the Zi are separated into several groups to describe\ncluster subunits. In the case of the ND minimum, the\ncentroids of the single particle wave packets are located\naround the origin and the wave packets are strongly deformed, (\u03bdx , \u03bdy , \u03bdz ) = (0.16, 0.14, 0.11), suggesting that\nthe nature of the mean-field is deformed. In the case\nof the SD minimum, the wave packets are further deformed, (\u03bdx , \u03bdy , \u03bdz ) = (0.17, 0.15, 0.10), and reveal the\naspect of a triaxially deformed mean-field. In the case\nof the SD minimum, the centroids of the single particle\nwave packets appear separated into two (28+12) or three\n((12+16)+12) groups and the density distribution reveals\nan octupole deformation implying that the SD minimum\nalso has an asymmetric cluster-like nature. It will be\nshown using the d-constraint that this has a significant\noverlap with the 12 C-28 Si cluster structure.\nThere are few studies on the triaxial deformation of\n40\nCa, but some theoretical work has suggested the triaxiality of the ND [7, 8] and SD [19] states. The present\ncalculation with the \u03b2-constraint has shown that most\n\n\f5\nof the states on the energy curve have a triaxial deformation. We therefore consider it indispensable to study\nthe issue without the assumption of spatial symmetry in\norder to understand the excited states of 40 Ca.\n\u03b1-36 Ar: type (a)\n\n2 fm\n\n\u03b1-36 Ar: type (b)\n\n2 fm\n\n12\n\nC-28 Si\n\ndid not find a change in the orientation of the clusters.\nd-constraints have generated excited energy curves in\nwhich the system has prominent cluster structures.

We have therefore applied the dconstraint. We discuss the results obtained with d\u03b1-36 Ar and d12 C-28 Si -constraints. Other combinations of clusters\nsuch as 2\u03b1-32 Si have been also applied, but they have\nappeared at comparatively high excitation energy levels\nand were not involved with the ND and SD states even\nafter the GCM calculation.\nBy applying the d\u03b1-36 Ar -constraint, we have obtained\nan excited energy curve above the energy curve obtained\nwith the \u03b2-constraint (Fig. 1). Two different kinds of\nstructure appeared on the energy curve. In both cases,\nthe system has well developed \u03b1-36 Ar cluster structures\nas may be clearly seen in their density distributions (Fig.\n3 (a) and (b)). The difference between them is the\norientation of the axis of symmetry in the oblately deformed 36 Ar cluster. The first is denoted as type (a).\nIn this type, the axis of symmetry for 36 Ar is perpendicular to the vector that connects the \u03b1 and 36 Ar clusters. Therefore the whole system has a triaxial deformation. This type of structure is favored under d\u03b1-36 Ar constraints with large d\u03b1-36 Ar values and appears in the\nregion of \u03b2 =0.45-0.7. The second kind of structure is\ndenoted type (b). In this type, the axis of symmetry in\nthe 36 Ar cluster is parallel to the vector that connects the\n\u03b1 and 36 Ar clusters, resulting in an axial deformation of\nthe system. This type is obtained when the inter-cluster\ndistance is restricted to a shorter distance (d\u03b1-36 Ar =4.55.5 fm) and appears in the region of \u03b2=0.15-0.3. It is\ninteresting that type (b) is bound deeper than type (a)\nfor shorter inter-cluster distances and 36 Ar changes its\norientation as the inter-cluster distance becomes larger.\nWe assume that 36 Ar changes its orientation to make\nthe overlap and potential energy between the \u03b1 and 36 Ar\nclusters larger.\nBy applying a d12 C-28 Si -constraint (d12 C-28 Si =4.0-6.0\nfm), we obtained a strongly deformed and excited energy curve that appears in the region of \u03b2=0.55-0.8. The\nsystem has a prominent 12 C-28 Si cluster structure and is\ntriaxially deformed as shown in Fig. 3.

The\nJ \u03c0 =0+ and 2+ states obtained with the \u03b2-constraint are\nshown in Fig. 4. AMP reduces the excitation energies of\nthe deformed states. For example, the J \u03c0 =0+ states of\nND and SD are lowered by approximately 6 and 9 MeV\nrespectively. As a result, they almost degenerate in terms\nof energy. We have obtained two 2+ states for each given\nvalue of \u03b2 in the deformed region by the diagonalization\nof the quantum number K. These states are denoted as\nK \u03c0 =0+ and 2+ according to the dominant component of\ntheir wave function. The presence of the K \u03c0 =2+ state\nis due to the triaxial deformation in the \u03b2 & 0.3 region.\nAs will be discussed below, the triaxial deformations of\nthe ND and SD states leads to the presence of their side\nbands, K \u03c0 =2+ .\nThe energy of the wave functions obtained with the\nd-constraint are also lowered by AMP. The \u03b1-36 Ar type\n(a), (b) and 12 C-28 Si states are lowered by approximately\n5-10, 10-15 MeV and 10 MeV respectively. \u03b1-36 Ar type\n(a) and 12 C-28 Si wave functions have the K \u03c0 =2+ components because of the triaxial deformation.\n\n\f6\nC.\n1.\n\nGCM Calculation\n\nEnergy levels and deformations\n\nAfter applying the AMP, we carried out GCM calculations. For the GCM basis, we adopted 15 \u03b2-constrained\nwave functions \u03b2 = 0.00-0.73, 7 d\u03b1-36 Ar -constrained wave\nfunctions of type (a) with d\u03b1-36 Ar = 4.5-9.0 fm, 3 d\u03b1-36 Ar constrained wave functions of type (b) with d\u03b1-36 Ar =\n4.5-5.5 fm, and 3 d12 C-28 Si -constrained wave functions\nwith d12 C-28 Si = 4.0-6.0 fm. Then we obtained the final GCM wave functions by diagonalizing Hamiltonian\nand norm matrices for the parity and angular momentum projected states with K \u03c0 = 0+ and \u00b12+ for the 28\nindependent wave functions.\nThe theoretical energy levels of the GCM states and\nthe experimental levels are shown in Fig. 5. The energies\nof the simple AMP for the main components in the band\nheads are also given. In most levels, the GCM states\ngain 1-2 MeV from the simple AMP. Experimentally, the\n+\nK \u03c0 = 0+ , 2+ and 0+ bands built on J \u03c0 = 0+\n2 , 21 and\n+\n+\n03 states are known to be the ND band (K \u03c0 = 0ND ), the\nside band of the ND band (K \u03c0 = 2+\nND ) and the SD band\n(K \u03c0 = 0+\nSD ). In the result of the GCM calculation, we\nobtained three K \u03c0 = 0+ and two K \u03c0 = 2+ bands in lowlying states above the ground state. We assigned the first\nand second K \u03c0 = 0+ bands to the observed K \u03c0 = 0+\nND\n\u03c0\n+\nand 0+\nSD bands respectively, and the first K = 2 band\nto the observed K \u03c0 = 2+\nND band, because the theoretical moments of inertia and electric transition strength\nB(E2) of these bands correlate well with the experimental data for the corresponding bands as discussed below.\nThe second K \u03c0 = 2+ band in the results is regarded as\nthe side band K \u03c0 = 2+\nSD of the SD band. We denote\nthe third theoretical K \u03c0 = 0+ band as the K \u03c0 = 0+\nob\nband because of the oblate shape. We also obtained the\nK \u03c0 = 0+ and 2+ bands in highly excited states with\nlarge \u03b1-36 Ar cluster structure components, which are the\ncandidates for \u03b1-36 Ar higher-nodal bands, K \u03c0 = 0+\nhn and\n+\n2hn , observed experimentally [15].\nLet us consider the GCM results of the low-lying states\n(ground, ND, SD and oblate states) in more detail by\nanalyzing the squared overlap between J \u03c0 = 0+ states\nand the AMP states from the \u03b2-constrained wave func+\ntions. The ND state's K \u03c0 = 0+\nND and 2ND bands are\nmainly constructed from the \u03b2-constrained wave functions around the ND minimum occurring in the \u03b2 \u223c 0.4\nregion. Their band-head states have a maximum overlap\nof approximately 85% for the triaxially deformed state\nwith (\u03b2, \u03b3) = (0.39, 25.2\u25e6). There is no mixing between\nthe ND state and the ground state. The squared overlap with the \u03b2-constrained wave functions is almost unchanged up to high spin states along the K \u03c0 = 0+\nND band.\nOn the other hand, in the K \u03c0 = 2+\nband,\nthe\nsquared\nND\noverlap of each component changes with the increase in\nspin, which implies the change of structure in this band.\nIn the result of the GCM calculation, the theoretical ex-\n\nTABLE II: The squared overlap (SO) of \u03b2-constrained wave\nfunctions and d-constrained wave functions.\n\u03b2-constraint\nd-constraint\nK\u03c0 J \u03c0\nSO\nSO configuration\n+\nND\n0+\n0.99\n0.37\n\u03b1-36 Ar\nND 0\n+\n2\n0.99\n0.40\n4+\n0.99\n0.40\n+\n2+\n0.99\n0.40\nND 2\n+\n3\n0.99\n0.45\n4+\n0.99\n0.46\n+\n12\nSD\n0+\n0.95\n0.59\nC-28 Si\nSD 0\n+\n2\n0.95\n0.59\n4+\n0.95\n0.56\n+\n2+\n0.95\n0.61\nSD 2\n+\n3\n0.95\n0.61\n4+\n0.95\n0.60\n+\n36\n\u03b1- Ar\n0hn 0+\n0.41\n0.49\n\u03b1-36 Ar\nhigher-nodal\n2+\n0.45\n0.50\n4+\n0.52\n0.50\n+\n2hn 2+\n0.38\n0.55\n3+\n0.52\n0.45\n4+\n0.59\n0.39\n\ncitation energies of the band heads in the K \u03c0 = 0+\nND\nand 2+\nND bands are 11.2 MeV and 12.1 MeV respectively.\nThese are much higher than the experimental excitation\nenergies. However, the rotational energies in the band\nare reproduced well, as shown in Fig. 6.\n+\nThe SD states, K \u03c0 = 0+\nSD and 2SD , are constructed\nmainly by \u03b2-constrained wave functions around the\nSD local minimum. The main component is the \u03b2constrained wave function with triaxial shape, (\u03b2, \u03b3) =\n(0.62, 14.5\u25e6). The squared overlap is more than 90% in\nthe band-head states, and almost unchanged up to high\n+\nspin states along the K \u03c0 = 0+\nSD and 2SD bands. A small\ndegree of mixing between the ND and SD bands is seen\nin the \u03b2 \u223c 0.5 region. The result of the GCM calculation reveals the band-head energies of the K \u03c0 = 0+\nSD\nand 2+\nSD bands are 12.1 MeV and 14.0 MeV respectively.\nAlthough the present calculations overestimate the experimental excitation energies of the K \u03c0 = 0+\nSD band as\nwell as the ND bands, the rotational energies in the band\nare reproduced well as shown in Fig. 6.\nThe oblate bands are dominated by the \u03b2-constrained\nwave functions in the \u03b2 \u223c 0.3 region. The main\ncomponent is the oblate wave function with (\u03b2, \u03b3) =\n(0.33, 51.2\u25e6). The oblate band (K \u03c0 = 0+\nob ) has not been\ndiscovered experimentally yet.

The\ndefinition of the specific functional space is explained in\n\u00a7II C. The squared overlap between the ND state and \u03b2-\n\nconstrained wave functions is 99%. This means that the\nND state is practically represented by the \u03b2-constrained\nwave functions alone. On the other hand, it is surprising that the ND states have a significant overlap of approximately 40% with the d\u03b1-36 Ar -constrained wave functions as well. This indicates that the \u03b2-constrained wave\nfunctions for the ND states include the \u03b1-36 Ar component, though the spatially developed cluster structure is\nnot seen in the density distributions. The \u03b1-36 Ar cluster\ncomponent in the ND band is mainly consistent with type\n(a) wave functions, while the squared overlap of type (b)\nwave functions in ND states is almost negligible. The result, that the ND state contains an \u03b1-36 Ar cluster structure component, is associated with the results of the \u03b136\nAr potential model calculation [10, 11],36 Ar(6 Li,d)40 Ca\nreaction [14, 15] and \u03b1-36 Ar OCM calculation[13].\nThe SD states are dominated by the \u03b2-constrained\nwave function as well as the ND states. However, the\nSD states also have a large overlap with the d12 C-28 Si constrained wave functions as reflected by the SO of approximately 60%. We found that the \u03b2-constrained AMD\nwave functions for the SD states also include the cluster\ncomponents, even though the cluster structure is not visible in the density distributions. The 12 C-28 Si cluster\nconfigurations also make a significant contribution to the\nenergy of the SD states. In particular, the energies of\nthe SD states gain 1-2 MeV due to the mixing of 12 C-\n\n\f8\n28\n\nSi cluster structure wave functions. This is associated\nwith the results of spherical-basis AMD [21] according\nto which the SD states have a 12 C-28 Si cluster structure\nconfiguration.\n\n3.\n\n+\n\u03b1-36 Ar higher-nodal states, K \u03c0 = 0+\nhn and 2hn bands\n\nAs shown in Fig. 5, we obtained K \u03c0 = 0+ and 2+\nbands with large \u03b1-36 Ar cluster components in the excitation energy region approximately 10 MeV higher than\nthe ND band. The main component of the higher \u03b1-36 Ar\n+\nbands, K \u03c0 = 0+\nhn and 2hn , are d\u03b1-36 Ar -constrained wave\nfunctions obtained with a large distance d\u03b1-36 Ar = 6.0 fm.\nWe assume that this corresponds to the \u03b1-36 Ar highernodal band observed with the 36 Ar(6 Li,d)40 Ca reaction\n[15], where the fragments of the J \u03c0 = 0+ state for this\nband were reported around 8 MeV above the band-head\nof the ND band.\n0.40\nnormal-deformed\nhigher-nodal\n\n0.35\n0.30\n0.25\n0.20\n0.15\n0.10\n\nTABLE III: Theoretical and experimental B(E2) of 40 Ca.\nThe units of transitions are Weisskopf units, B(E2)W.u. =\n8.12 e2 fm4 .

The squared overlap for 0hn is\nsuppressed in the small d\u03b1-36 Ar region and has a peak at\nd\u03b1-36 Ar = 6 fm, which demonstrates the nodal property of\nthe inter-cluster motion in this band. It can be assumed\nthat the \u03b1-36 Ar higher-nodal states arise from the intercluster excitation built on the ND states. In other words,\nthe significant component of the \u03b1-36 Ar cluster structure\nin the ND states must be essential for the formation of the\nhigher-nodal states, because the cluster component in the\nsmall distance region is possible if the ND states contain\nno cluster component. This means that the higher-nodal\nstates appear as a consequence of the orthogonality to\nthe cluster components with a small distance d, which\nare already contained in the ND states. This situation is\nsimilar to the relationship between the ground band and\n\n\u03b1-40 Ca higher-nodal band in 44 Ti suggested by Kimura\net al. with deformed-basis AMD [28].\n\n4.\n\nElectric transitions\n\nHere, we investigate the electric quadrupole strengths\nand discuss the band structure. The theoretical and experimental values of E2 transition strengths B(E2) are\nshown in Fig. 8. The B(E2) values for intra-band transitions are remarkably strong, and the transitions between\n\u03c0\nthe K \u03c0 = 0+\n= 2+\nND and K\nND bands, and those be+\n\u03c0\ntween the K = 0SD and 2+\nSD bands are also strong.\nThis reflects the side-band features of the K \u03c0 = 2+\nND\n+\n\u03c0\nand K \u03c0 = 2+\nSD bands, corresponding to K = 0ND and\nK \u03c0 = 0+\nSD respectively. The inter-band transitions between ND and SD states and those from ND or SD states\nto the ground state are underestimated. This is because\nmixing of wave functions among these bands is small in\nour calculation. On the other hand, we predict the transitions from the oblate K \u03c0 = 0+\nob band to the ND bands,\n+\nK \u03c0 = 0+\nand\n2\n,\nbecause\nof\nthe mixing among these\nND\nND\nbands.\nDetailed comparisons between the theoretical values\n\n\f9\n\nexp.\n\nK\u03c0=0+ND\n\nexcitation energy [MeV]\n\n12\n11\n10\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\nK\u03c0=2+ND\n\ntheory\n\nK\u03c0=0+SD\n\nK\u03c0=0+ND\n\nK\u03c0=2+ND\n\nK\u03c0=0+SD\n\nK\u03c0=2+SD\n\nK\u03c0=0+ob\n8\n\n19\n18\n17\n16\n15\n14\n13\n12\n11\n10\n9\n\n8\n\n7\n8\n\n8\n8\n\n8\n\n7\n6\n5\n\n6\n\n4\n3\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n6\n4\n4\n\n2\n0\n\n2\n0\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n\nunknown\n-4\n4- 16\n16- 32\n32- 64\n64-128\n128-\n\n8\n\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n\n6\n4\n\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n\n6\n\n4\n2\n0\n\n2\n0\n\n\u2248\n0\n\n4- 16\n16- 32\n32- 64\n64-128\n128-\n\n\u2248\n0\n\nFIG. 8: Experimental and theoretical B(E2) values.

The experimental data are taken from Refs. 13 and\n26. \"unknown\" indicates the transition has been observed but B(E2) has not been measured.\n\nand experimental data of the B(E2) values are shown\nin Table III. The B(E2) values for the intra-band transitions in the ND and SD states are reproduced well,\nexcept for the 6+ \u2192 4+ transition when K \u03c0 = 0+\nND . The\nsmall value of the experimental B(E2; 6+ \u2192 4+ ) is overestimated by the calculation, although the error in the\nexperimental value is rather large.\nQuadrupole moment\nThe theoretical and experimental values of quadrupole\nmoments deduced from the E2 strengths for the K \u03c0 =\n+\n+\n0+\nND , 2ND and 0SD bands are listed in Table IV. The\nresults of other theoretical studies are also shown in the\ntable. The intrinsic quadrupole moment Q is defined by\nthe B(E2) value as follows.\nQ\u2261\n\ns\n\n16\u03c0 B(E2, Ii \u2192 If )\n,\n5e2 hIi K20|If Ki2\n\n(14)\n\nwhere hIi K20|If Ki is the Clebsh-Gordan coefficient.\nThe theoretical quadrupole moments of the ND and SD\nstates are around 130 fm2 and 220 fm2 respectively. The\nvalues are almost unchanged up to high spin. This means\nthat the ND and SD bands consist of approximately rigid\nrotor states. These results are consistent with the rigid\nrotor-like spin dependence of the excitation energies of\nthe ND and SD states shown in Fig. 6. The theoretical\nQ moments are consistent with experimental values evaluated from life-time measurements and branching ratios\n(I) except for the 6+ \u2192 4+ transition in the ND state.\nThe small value of the experimental Q moment for the\n\n6+ \u2192 4+ transition might suggest some structure change\nin high spin states in the ND band.\nWe compared our results with those of other theoretical studies. The Q values in (4) \u03b1-36 Ar OCM are consistent with the present values for the ND states. This\nmay indicate that the deformation of the ND states in\nour calculations is similar to that calculated with the \u03b136\nAr cluster model. In (1) the spherical-basis AMD and\n(3) the shell model, smaller Q values for the K \u03c0 = 0+\nstates were obtained by comparison to our model. In (2)\nSHF-BCS + GCM, the Q values are also smaller than our\nresults for K \u03c0 = 0+ states. In particular, the Q moments\nfor the 4+ \u2192 2+ transition in both the ND and SD states\nare remarkably small. This shows that the ND and SD\nbands obtained in the SHF-BCS + GCM calculation are\nnot rigid rotor-like. This seems to be inconsistent with\nexperimental results regarding the rigid rotor-like property, which has been found in rotational energies and E2\ntransitions. In recent experimental observations, the Q\nvalues have been obtained by globally fitting all transitions. They ((II)-a and b) are smaller than the values of\nthe life-time measurement (I) and also smaller than the\npresent results. Further analysis requires more detailed\nmeasurements of the E2 transition strengths.\nTriaxial rotor\nIn this section we discuss the characteristics of the side\nbands, K \u03c0 = 2+ , in the ND and SD states. In a naive\ncollective model, a K \u03c0 = 2+ band can be described by\neither a triaxial rotor or a \u03b3 vibration. In order to identify\nthe mode of the side bands, it is useful to analyze the\n\n\f10\nTABLE IV: Intrinsic quadrupole moments of the ND band and the SD band extracted from B(E2).

The value of Rrot is 0.7 for the axial symmetric\nlimit, \u03b3 \u2192 0\u25e6 and 60\u25e6 . As the triaxiality increases, Rrot\ndecreases, going to zero at the peak of triaxiality, \u03b3 =\n30\u25e6 . Regarding the ND state, the theoretical value R\nof the E2 strength ratio is nearly equal to 0, and the\nexperimental value R = 0.06 is also close to 0. Both the\nvalues agree well with Rrot (\u03b3 \u223c 30\u25e6 ) but are far from that\nof the \u03b3 vibration limit, 0.7. In the present results, the\n\u03b3 value of the main component of the ND state is 25.2\u25e6,\nwhich is consistent with \u03b3 \u223c 30\u25e6 for the triaxial rotor\nderived from the experimental R value. We therefore\nconclude that the mode of the observed K \u03c0 = 2+\nND band\nis a triaxial rotor, not a \u03b3 vibration.\nRegarding the SD state, the theoretical value of R\nis equal to 0.51, and the \u03b3 value of the main component of the theoretical SD state is 14.5\u25e6 . These values,\n(\u03b3, R) = (14.5\u25e6 , 0.51) can be described by the relation\nRrot (\u03b3) in Eq. (15) for the triaxial rotor.

Superposing mean-field-type and\ncluster structure-type wave functions obtained with \u03b2and d-constraints respectively, we obtained the ground\nstates, ND, SD, oblate and \u03b1-36 Ar higher-nodal states.\nWe found both the ND and SD bands are constructed\nfrom triaxially deformed shapes, and we obtained the\nK \u03c0 = 2+ side bands of these bands. The theoretical B(E2) and moments of inertia are consistent with\nexperimental data, although the excitation energies are\nhigher than empirical values. By analyzing quadrupole\nmoments calculated from the B(E2) and the E2 strength\nratio R values, we found that the ND and SD states can\nbe understood by a relatively rigid rotor conception of\ntriaxial deformations. The ND band and it's side band\ncontain approximately 40% of the \u03b1-36 Ar cluster structure component, and the SD band and it's side band con-\n\n[1] H. Horiuchi, K. Ikeda and Y. Suzuki, Prog.

The \u03b1-36 Ar higher-nodal band was obtained\ndue to the excitation of inter-cluster motion between the\n\u03b1 and 36 Ar clusters. The present results suggested that\ncluster correlation will be important for deformation and\nexcitation even in medium- and heavy-weight nuclei.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work has been supported by JSPS Research Fellowships for Young Scientists.
