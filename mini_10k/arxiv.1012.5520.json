We prove that Morse relations hold and, at\nlast, we give a definition of multiplicity of geodesics which is geometrical\nmeaningful. In section 5 we compare our theory with the weak slope approach existing in literature.

A conical manifold M is a complete n-dimensional C 0 sub\nmanifold of Rm which is everywhere smooth, except for a finite set of points V .\nA point in V is called vertex.\nThese kind of manifold have many common features with other singular\nmanifolds present in literature, as the Cone-manifolds studied by Hodgson and\nTysk [17], the piecewise linear manifolds (see, e.g [1, 21, 22]), or the Orbifolds\n([6, 5, 23]); in [16] these links are briefly examined.\nFurthermore, the geodesic problem on a singular manifold is studied by\nDegiovanni and Morbini, in [12]. In section 5 we will point out the common\nfeature and the main differences between our approach and the Degiovanni and\nMorbini one.\nIn our previous work we gave the following definition of geodesic, which\nseems to be appropriate for these kind of problems ([15, Definition 2]).\nDefinition 1.2. A path \u03b3 \u2208 H 1,2 ([0, 1], M ) is a geodesic iff\n\u2022 the set T = T\u03b3 := {s \u2208 (0, 1) : \u03b3(s) \u2208 V } is a closed set without internal\npart;\n\u2217 Dipartimento\n\ndi Matematica, Universit\u00e0 di Pisa, via Buonarroti 1c, 56127, Pisa, Italy\n\n1\n\n\f\u2022 Ds \u03b3 0 = 0 \u2200s \u2208 [0, 1] r T ;\n\u2022 |\u03b3 0 |2 is constant as a function in L1 .\nBy this definition, we were able to prove a deformation lemma that allows us to\napply the main theorems of the calculus of variation in the large. In particular\nwe can estimate the number of geodesics using the Ljusternik-Schnirelmann\ntheory ([15, Theorem 1]).\nIn this work we will associate to each geodesic \u03b3 an index i(\u03b3) similar to\nthe Morse index, that allows us to obtain some information on the qualitative\nproperties of the geodesics. By this index we state also an analogous of the\nMorse relations that hold in the smooth case.\nAs usual, given p, q \u2208 M , we set\n\b\n\u03a9 = \u03a9p,q := \u03b3 \u2208 W 1,2 ([0, 1], Rn )|\u03b3(0) = p, \u03b3(1) = q, \u03b3([0, 1]) \u2282 M ,\nthe suitable path space, and a functional\nE:\u03a9\u2192R\nZ1\nE(\u03b3) =\n\nk\u03b3 0 k2 dt.\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n0\n\nMoreover we set\n\u03a9c = \u03a9cp,q := {\u03b3 \u2208 \u03a9, E(\u03b3) \u2264 c} .\n\u03a9ba = {\u03a9p,q }ba := {\u03b3 \u2208 \u03a9, a \u2264 E(\u03b3) \u2264 b} .\nUnder suitable assumption, if M is a generic smooth manifold, we know that\nthe following Morse relations hold.\nX\n\u03bbm(\u03b3) = P\u03bb (\u03a9a , \u03a9b ) + (1 + \u03bb)Q\u03bb .\n(3)\nK\u2229\u03a9ba\n\nX\n\n\u03bbm(\u03b3) = P\u03bb (\u03a9) + (1 + \u03bb)Q\u03bb .\n\n(4)\n\nK\n\nwhere K is the set of geodesics, P\u03bb (X, Y ) is the Poincar\u00e9 polynomial (in the\nvariable \u03bb) of the couple (X, Y ), Q\u03bb is a formal series with coefficient in N \u222a\n{+\u221e}, and m(\u03b3) is the Morse index of the geodesic \u03b3, i.e. the signature of\nthe second variation of the energy. Furthermore, if we take a geodesic \u03b3 s.t.\nE(\u03b3) = c and \u03a9c+\u03b5\nc\u2212\u03b5 \u2229 K = \u03b3 for some \u03b5 > 0, then we have that\n\u03bbm(\u03b3) = P\u03bb (\u03a9c+\u03b5 , \u03a9c\u2212\u03b5 )\n\n(5)\n\n(for some references on Morse theory the reader can check, for example [19],\n[2, 3, 4],[8]).\nComing back to conical manifold, the usual definition of m(\u03b3) makes no sense\nsince the energy is not differentiable. However, under suitable assumptions, we\ncan define the index of a geodesic as the formal polynomial\ni(\u03b3) = P\u03bb (\u03a9c+\u03b5 , \u03a9c\u2212\u03b5 ),\n\n2\n\n(6)\n\n\faccording to (5). In this case the Morse relations (3) and (4) become\nX\ni(\u03b3) = P\u03bb (\u03a9a , \u03a9b ) + (1 + \u03bb)Q\u03bb .\n\n(7)\n\nK\u2229\u03a9ba\n\nX\n\ni(\u03b3) = P\u03bb (\u03a9) + (1 + \u03bb)Q\u03bb .\n\n(8)\n\nK\n\nIn this work we prove that i(\u03b3) is a good definition, i.e. does not depends on \u03b5\nand that (7) and (8) hold.\nWe have also that, while in a smooth manifold, for a generic geodesic, i(\u03b3)\nis a monome in \u03bb, for a geodesic in a conical manifold this is not true. Then we\nhave introduce the multiplicity of a geodesic (Definition 4.5) as\nmult(\u03b3) = i(\u03b3)|\u03bb=1 .\n\n(9)\n\nwe show some examples in which an high multiplicity, or a 0 multiplicity of a\ngeodesic occurs.\nAlso, the definition of index that we give, allows us to make a comparison\nbetween our approach to conical manifold and the approach of Degiovanni,\nMarzocchi and Morbini (Section 5), which is based on the concept of the weak\nslope (see [7, 9, 10, 11]), and was presented in [12, 18]\n\n2\n\nPreliminary Results\n\nIn this section we present some peculiarities of the study of geodesics in conical\nmanifold, which motivate Definition 1.2. Also, we resume briefly some result\ncontained in [15] which will be useful for this paper.\nUsually there are two ways to introduce geodesics in a smooth manifolds: at\nfirst we can formulate a Cauchy problem, i.e., given p \u2208 M , v \u2208 Tp M , we look\nfor a continuous curve \u03b3 : I \u2192 M s.t.\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 Ds \u03b3 0 = 0;\n\u03b3(0) = p;\n(10)\n\uf8f3 0\n\u03b3 (0) = v.\nOtherwise we can choose a suitable path space and an energy functional, for\nexample, the space \u03a9 and the functional E previously defined, and we look for\ncritical points of the energy.\nContrarily to the smooth case, these two methods are not equivalent for\nmanifolds which have conical singularities, and each one of them have some\npeculiarity. If we try to solve the Cauchy problem we have neither uniqueness\nnor continuous dependence from starting condition: David Stone (see [21], [22])\nshowed that there are piecewise linear manifold with a vertex p (indeed a special\ncase of conical manifolds) in which, given a point q, there is a family of minimal\ngeodesics solving (10) that are the same straight line between q and p, then\nstart again from p with different angles. So (10) has many solutions, and there\nis no reasonable criterion to choose one of these geodesics instead of another.\nNow, taken an Euclidean half cone, we can represent it as a circular sector\nin a plane, in which the straight edges are identified. Taking p on these edges,\nwe represent the geodesics as straight lines starting from p. In Fig. 1 we show\n3\n\n\fp\nFigure 1: Geodesics starting from a point.\n\ntwo sequence of geodesics, respectively the continuous and the dotted lines,\napproaching the edges of the circular sector. It is easy to see that a dotted and\na continuous line can not be too close, even if they approach the geodesic which\nstart from p and goes to the vertex. Even in a familiar case we are not able\nto say how can a geodesic pass through the vertex, in order to have continuous\ndependence from initial data.\nAlso, if we take two points, say p and q, symmetrical respect to the vertex, we\ncan say that there are always two minimal geodesics joining them, even if p and\nq are as close as we want; so it is not possible to define a normal neighborhood\nof the vertex. Thus we can not hope to define a global exponential map.\nThe functional approach, on the contrary, gives us an easy result on minimal\ngeodesics. To finding minima is useful to extend E in the whole space\n\b\n1,2\nWp,q\n:= \u03b3 \u2208 W 1,2 ([0, 1], Rn )| \u03b3(0) = p, \u03b3(1) = q\n\n(11)\n\nand to look at minima of E with the constraint Im(\u03b3) \u2282 M ; in this way we\nknow that E is lower semi continuous for the W 1,2 -weak topology and the set\n\b\n1,2\n1,2\n\u03b3|\u03b3 \u2208 \u03a9 \u2229 Wp,q\n, k\u03b3kW 1,2 < c is weakly compact in Wp,q\n, because M is\ncomplete: then the problem\nmin1,2 E(\u03b3)\n(12)\n\u03b3\u2208Wp,q\nIm\u03b3\u2282M\n\nhas a solution, and we can formulate the following theorem.\nTheorem 2.1. Let M be a conical manifold; let p, q \u2208 M .\nThen, the energy functional\nE : \u03a9p,q \u2192 R\nR1\nE(\u03b3) = k\u03b3 0 k2 dt.\n0\n\nhas a minimum.\nProof. Just proved.\n4\n\n(13)\n\n\fHowever, this approach is not completely useful, because the energy is not\nsmooth, so there is no easy way to define a critical point of energy different\nfrom minimum. In the cited work we gave a generalized definition of geodesic\n(Definition 2) which seems to be the right one for these kind of problems.\nIn fact, although this is a local definition, it let us show two deformation\nlemmas typical of the calculus of variation in the large ([15, Theorem 2 and\nTheorem 7]). This lemmas are crucial for this work and are briefly recalled\nhere. In the next section we will provide also some sketch of the proof of these\nresults.\nLemma 2.2 (First deformation lemma). Let M be a conical manifold, and let\np, q \u2208 M . Suppose that there exists c > 0 s.t. there are a finite number of\ngeodesics with energy lesser than c. Suppose also that there are no geodesics\nwhich energy is in the strip [a, b] for some a, b \u2208 R, a < b < c. Then \u03a9a is a\ndeformation retract of \u03a9b .\nLemma 2.3 (Second deformation lemma). Let M be a conical manifold, p, q \u2208\nM . Suppose that there exists c > 0 s.t. there are a finite number of geodesics\nwith energy lesser than c. Suppose also that there are no geodesics which energy\nis in the strip [a, b) for some a, b \u2208 R, a < b < c. Set kb the set of b-energy\ngeodesics, then there exists a neighborhood U of kb s.t.\n\u03a9b r U ' \u03a9a .\nThese results link the topological structure of sublevels of E with our definition of geodesics and allow us to consider geodesics as critical points of energy.\nBy these lemmas, in the cited work we proved an estimate on the number of\ngeodesic in a conical manifold, via the Ljusternik-Schnirelmann theory. In this\npaper these lemmas allow us to prove that the definition of the index i(\u03b3) is a\ngood definition.\n\n3\n\nMorse Theory For Critical Levels\n\nIn order to define the index of a critical point and of a critical level, we recall\nthe definition of Poincar\u00e9 polynomial\nDefinition 3.1. Let H \u2217 the Alexander-Spanier cohomology with coefficient in\na field F. For every pair (X, A) of closed spaces, the Poincar\u00e9 polynomial is the\nformal series in the variable \u03bb (with the convention that \u03bb\u221e = 0)\nP\u03bb (X, A, F) = P\u03bb (X, A) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\ndim H q (X, A, F)\u03bbq .\n\n(14)\n\nq=0\n\nMoreover, we set\nP\u03bb (X, F) := P\u03bb (X, \u2205, F).\n\n(15)\n\nFor the main properties of the formal series we refer to [4]. We use the\nAlexander-Spanier cohomology (see [20] for an exhaustive treatment) to define\nthe index of a geodesic because we need its continuity property (recalled in\nTheorem 4.2) to prove Theorem 4.3.\n\n5\n\n\fDefinition 3.2. Given p, q \u2208 M , suppose that there exists a c\u0304 s.t. \u03a9c\u0304 contains\na finite number of geodesics. Let c < c\u0304. Set, as usual kc the set of c-energy\ngeodesic, we define the index of kc as\ni(kc ) = P\u03bb (\u03a9c+\u03b5 , \u03a9c\u2212\u03b5 ),\n\n(16)\n\nfor \u03b5 sufficiently small.\nIn order to prove that 3.2 is a good definition, we need to show now that\nthere exists \u03b5\u0304 s.t. \u2200\u03b51 < \u03b52 \u2264 \u03b5\u0304\nP\u03bb (\u03a9c+\u03b51 , \u03a9c\u2212\u03b51 ) = P\u03bb (\u03a9c+\u03b52 , \u03a9c\u2212\u03b52 ).\nIn order to prove it, we show that \u03a9c+\u03b52 retracts on \u03a9c+\u03b51 and that \u03a9c\u2212\u03b51\nretracts on \u03a9c\u2212\u03b52 . This is possible by the deformation lemmas (2.2 and 2.3)\ncited previously. Here we recall shortly the main tools of the proof.\nWe choose \u03b5 s.t. [c \u2212 \u03b5, c + \u03b5] contains only c as critical value. We start\nc\u2212\u03b52\n1\ndefining some special subset of \u03a9c+\u03b5\nc+\u03b52 (for \u03a9c\u2212\u03b51 we will act in the same way).\nLet\n1\n\u03a3 = {\u03b3 \u2208 \u03a9c+\u03b5\n(17)\nc+\u03b52 , s.t. Im\u03b3 \u2229 V 6= \u2205}\n(we recall that V is the set of vertexes). If \u03b3i is a geodesic in \u03a9c+\u03b5 , let\n\u03a3i = {\u03b3 \u2208 \u03a3 s.t. \u03b3 = \u03b3i up to affine reparametrization }.\n\n(18)\n\nLemma 3.3. \u03a3i is compact for all i\nProof. The proof is not difficult and can be found in ([15, Lemma 3])\nBy the compactness we can prove the following lemma.\nS\nS\nLemma 3.4 (existence of retraction in i \u03a3i ). There exist R \u2283 i \u03a3i , \u03bd, t\u0304 \u2208 R+\nand\n\u03b7R : R \u00d7 [0, t\u0304 ] \u2192 H 1 (I, M )\na continuous function s.t.\n\u2022 \u03b7R (\u03b2, 0) = \u03b2\n\u2022 E(\u03b7R (\u03b2, t)) \u2212 E(\u03b2) < \u2212\u03bdt\nfor all t \u2208 [0, t\u0304 ], \u03b2 \u2208 R.\nProof. The proof is quite technical, and is based on a modification of Degiovanni\nand Marzocchi techniques. For the details we refer to ([15, Lemma 4])\nWe can prove also a deformation result that is in some sense the complementary of the previous lemma.\nS\nLemma 3.5. For any U \u2283 i \u03a3i there exist t\u0304, \u03bd \u2208 R+ and a continuous functional\nc+\u03b51\n1\n\u03b7U : \u03a9c+\u03b5\nc+\u03b52 r U \u00d7 [0, t\u0304 ] \u2192 \u03a9c+\u03b52\nsuch that\n\u2022 \u03b7U (*, 0) = Id\n6\n\n\f\u2022 E(\u03b7U (\u03b2, t)) \u2212 E(\u03b2) \u2264 \u2212\u03bdt\nc+\u03b51\nrU\nfor all t \u2208 [0, t\u0304 ], for all \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a9c+\u03b5\n2\n\nProof. We use that for every \u03b3 \u2208 \u03a3 r U we can find a vector field w\u03b3 s.t.\ndE(\u03b3)[w\u03b3 ] exists, although the energy is not smooth. Moreover, outside \u03a3\nthe energy can be differentiated, so we can use pseudo gradient vector field\nconstruction and we find the wanted retraction (for all details see [15, Lemma\n5])\nFrom Lemma 3.4 and Lemma 3.5 we get the following result, which states\nthat Definition 3.2 is a good definition.\nTheorem 3.6. Let M be a conical manifold, let p, q \u2208 M be s.t. E admits only\na finite set of critical points under a certain level c\u0304. Let c < c\u0304 be a critical level.\nThere exists an \u03b5 > 0 s.t., for any \u03b51 , \u03b52 < \u03b5, we have that\nP\u03bb (\u03a9c+\u03b51 , \u03a9c\u2212\u03b51 ) = P\u03bb (\u03a9c+\u03b52 , \u03a9c\u2212\u03b52 ).\n\n(19)\n\nProof. Because there are a finite number of critical points, we can choose \u03b5 s.t.\n[c \u2212 \u03b5, c + \u03b5] contains only c as critical value. Chosen \u03b51 < \u03b52 < \u03b5, we want\nto retract \u03a9c+\u03b52 on \u03a9c+\u03b51 and \u03a9c\u2212\u03b51 on \u03a9c\u2212\u03b52 . Defined as before \u03a3 and \u03a3i\n2\nin \u03a9c+\u03b5\nc+\u03b51 , we note that for i 6= j then \u03a3i \u2229 \u03a3j = \u2205, because the geodesics \u03b3i\nand \u03b3j are distinct. Set N the number\nof critical points under the level c + \u03b5,\nS\nwe can find a neighborhood R \u2283 \u03a3i and a retraction \u03b7R as in Lemma 3.4.\ni\n\nFurthermore, for every U \u2283\n\nN\nS\ni=0\n\n2\n\u03a3i there exists a retraction \u03b7U on \u03a9c+\u03b5\nc+\u03b51 r U in\n\nanalogy\nwith Lemma 3.5.

Let \u03b81 : \u03a9c+\u03b52 \u2192 [0, 1] be a\ncontinuous map s.t.\n\u03b81 |U \u2261 0;\n\u03b81 |\u03a9c+\u03b51 rV \u2261 1.\nThen we define a continuous map\n\u03bc1 : \u03a9c+\u03b52 \u00d7 [0, 1] \u2192 \u03a9c+\u03b52 ,\n\n(20)\n\n\u03bc1 (\u03b2, t) = \u03b7U (\u03b2, \u03b81 (\u03b2)t);\n\n(21)\n\nwe know that E(\u03bc1 (\u03b2, t)) \u2212 E(\u03b2) \u2264 \u2212\u03bdt\u03b81 (\u03b2), so\n\u03bc1 (\u03a9c+\u03b52 , 1) \u2282 V \u222a \u03a9c+\u03b52 \u2212\u03bd ,\nin fact if \u03bc1 (\u03b2, t) \u2208\n/ V for all t, then E(\u03bc1 (\u03b2, t)) \u2212 E(\u03b2) \u2264 \u2212\u03bdt, so \u03bc1 (\u03b2, 1) \u2208\n\u03a9c+\u03b52 \u2212\u03bd .\nBy \u03bc1 we have retracted \u03a9c+\u03b52 on \u03a9c+\u03b52 \u2212\u03bd \u222a V ; now we define a continuous\nmap \u03b82 : \u03a9c+\u03b52 \u2192 [0, 1] s.t.\n\u03b81 |\u03a9c+\u03b52\n\n\u2261 1;\n\nc+\u03b52 \u2212\u03bd/2\n\n7\n\n\f\u03b81 |\u03a9c+\u03b51 \u2212\u03bd \u2261 0.\nThen set\n\u03bc2 : V \u222a \u03a9c+\u03b52 \u2212\u03bd \u00d7 [0, 1] \u2192 \u03a9c+\u03b52 ,\n\n(22)\n\n\u03bc2 (\u03b2, t) = \u03b7R (\u03b2, \u03b82 (\u03b2)t);\n\n(23)\n\nc+\u03b52 \u2212\u03bd\n\nc+\u03b52 \u2212\u03bd/2\n\n\u03bc2 is a continuous map that retracts V \u222a \u03a9\non \u03a9\n. By iterating\nthis algorithm we can retract continuously \u03a9c+\u03b52 on \u03a9c+\u03b51 .\nThe retraction of \u03a9c\u2212\u03b51 on \u03a9c\u2212\u03b52 is obtained in the same way.\nRemark 3.7. The hypothesis of finiteness of critical points seems quite restrictive. Indeed, because we have a finite number of vertexes, in many concrete\nexamples this assumption is easily verified, as shown in the applications.\nTo conclude this section we show some properties of P\u03bb useful in the next.\nLemma 3.8. (see [2, lemma 4.2,(v)]). Let X a metric space, A, B two closed\nsubspace of X s.t. B \u2282 A \u2282 X; then there exist a formal series Q\u03bb s.t.\nP\u03bb (X, A) + P\u03bb (A, B) = P\u03bb (X, B) + (1 + \u03bb)Q\u03bb .\n\n(24)\n\nProof. We consider the exact sequence relative to the triple X, A, B:\n\u2217\n\u03b4q\u22121\n\ni\u2217\nq\n\njq\u2217\n\n\u03b4q\u2217\n\n. . . \u2212\u2192 H q (X, A) \u2212\u2192 H q (X, B) \u2212\u2192 H q (A, B) \u2212\u2192 . . .\nand we set\n\n(25)\n\naq = dim(ker i\u2217q ),\nbq = dim(ker jq\u2217 ),\ncq = dim(ker \u03b4q\u2217 ).\n\nBy exactness of (25) we have that\ndim H q (X, A) = aq + cq\u22121 ;\ndim H q (X, B) = aq + bq ;\ndim H q (A, B) = bq + cq ,\nthus\nP\u03bb (X, A) =\nP\u03bb (X, B) =\nP\u03bb (A, B) =\n\nP\u221e\nq\nq=0 (aq + cq\u22121 )\u03bb ;\nP\u221e\nq\nq=0 (aq + bq )\u03bb ;\nP\u221e\nq\nq=0 (bq + cq )\u03bb .\n\nSo\nP\u03bb (X, A) + P\u03bb (A, B) = P\u03bb (X, B) +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(cq + cq\u22121 )\u03bbq ,\n\n(26)\n\nq=0\n\nbut we can write\n\u221e\n\u221e\nX\nX\n(cq + cq\u22121 )\u03bbq = (1 + \u03bb)\ncq \u03bbq ,\nq=0\n\nand then, by setting Q\u03bb =\n\n(27)\n\nq=0\n\nP\u221e\n\nq\nq=0 cq \u03bb ,\n\nwe conclude the proof.\n\nLemma 3.9. (see [3, theorem II.3.5]) Let M a conical manifold. If M is\ntopologically trivial, then also \u03a9 is topologically trivial, thus\nP\u03bb (\u03a9) = 1.\n8\n\n\fProof. Obvious.\nBy lemma 3.8 we can formulate the Morse relations for critical levels.\nTheorem 3.10. Let M a conical manifold; let p, q \u2208 M s.t.

We know that there is a finite set, say {c1 , * * * , cl }, of critical levels in\n[a, b]. We can, by previous theorem, iterate (24) obtaining that\nl\nX\n\ni(kcj ) = P\u03bb (\u03a9cl+\u03b5 , \u03a9c1\u2212\u03b5 ) + (1 + \u03bb)Q\u03bb .\n\n(30)\n\nj=1\n\nThen by deformation lemma we obtain (28).\nFinally, by a limiting process, and considering that \u03a9\u22121 = \u2205 we can prove\n(29) (we recall that, by definition, P\u03bb (\u03a9, \u2205) = P\u03bb (\u03a9)).\n\n4\n\nMorse Theory For Geodesics\n\nIn this section we will define the Morse index for an isolated geodesics and\nfinally prove, as claimed, the Morse relations. Under some a priori bound on\nthe number of geodesics, we obtain an analogous of the Morse relations that\nholds in the smooth case.\nDefinition 4.1. Let c an isolated critical value. Let kc the set of c energy\ngeodesics and let \u03b3 an isolated point of kc . Then\ni(\u03b3) = P\u03bb (\u03a9c , \u03a9c r \u03b3)\n\n(31)\n\nTo proceed, we need to recall the continuity property of Alexander-Spanier\ncohomology (see [20, Cor. 6.6.3]).\nTheorem 4.2.

Let M a conical manifold. let p, q \u2208 M s.t. E admits only a\nfinite set of geodesics for every sublevel \u03a9c .\nThen, if a, b are regular values, we have\nX\ni(\u03b3) = P\u03bb (\u03a9a , \u03a9b ) + (1 + \u03bb)Q\u03bb .\n(33)\n\u03b3\u2208\u03a9ba geodesic\n\n9\n\n\fFurthermore, if we consider the whole space we obtain\nX\ni(\u03b3) = P\u03bb (\u03a9) + (1 + \u03bb)Q\u03bb .\n\n(34)\n\n\u03b3 geodesic\n\nProof. We know, by theorem 3.10 that\nX\ni(kc ) = P\u03bb (\u03a9a , \u03a9b ) + (1 + \u03bb)Q\u03bb ;\nc critical in (a,b)\n\nwhere\ni(kc ) = P\u03bb (\u03a9c+\u03b5 , \u03a9c\u2212\u03b5 ).\nBecause the critical point are in a finite number,\nwe can choose d s.t., if\nS\ni 6= j, B(\u03b3i , d) \u2229 B(\u03b3j , d) = \u2205. Setting Bkc (d) = \u03b3\u2208kc B\u03b3 , we have obviously,\nby the second deformation lemma, that \u03a9c\u2212\u03b5 ' \u03a9c r Bkc (d), thus\nP\u03bb (\u03a9c+\u03b5 , \u03a9c\u2212\u03b5 ) = P\u03bb (\u03a9c+\u03b5 , \u03a9c r Bkc (d)).\nThen, by the continuity property of the Alexander-Spanier cohomology (Theorem 4.2) we have\nP\u03bb (\u03a9c+\u03b5 , \u03a9c r Bkc (d)) = P\u03bb (\u03a9c , \u03a9c r Bkc (d)).\nTo obtain the proof we want to show that\nH \u2217 (\u03a9c , \u03a9c r Bkc (d)) ' H \u2217 (\u03a9c , \u03a9c r kc ).\nIt's easy to see that both \u03a9c rBkc (d), \u03a9c rkc are locally contractible subsets, so\nthere is an isomorphism between Alexander-Spanier and singular cohomology\nH\u0304 \u2217 (see [20, Chap.6,Sec.9]). Furthermore, according to Definition 3.1, we are\nworking with coefficient in a field F, so there is also an isomorphism between\nH\u0304 \u2217 and Hom(H\u0304\u2217 ) (see [20, Th.5.5.3]). So it is enough to show that\nHom(H\u2217 (\u03a9c , \u03a9c r Bkc (d))) ' Hom(H\u2217 (\u03a9c , \u03a9c r kc )).\nGiven \u03c9 \u2208 H\u2217 (\u03a9c , \u03a9c r kc ), we know that \u03c9 \u2208 H\u2217 (\u03a9c , \u03a9c r Bkc (d)) for a sufficiently small d, because \u03c9 has compact support. So\nH\u2217 (\u03a9c , \u03a9c r kc ) = lim\u2192 H\u2217 (\u03a9c , \u03a9c r Bkc (d)),\nd\n\nbut H\u2217 (\u03a9c , \u03a9c r Bkc (d)) is definitely constant in d, thus we have that\nH\u2217 (\u03a9c , \u03a9c r Bkc (d)) = H\u2217 (\u03a9c , \u03a9c r kc ).\nWe proved that\nP\u03bb (\u03a9c+\u03b5 , \u03a9c\u2212\u03b5 ) = P\u03bb (\u03a9c , \u03a9c r kc ).\nFinally, by excision, we obtain\nP\u03bb (\u03a9c , \u03a9c r kc ) =\n\nM\n\nP\u03bb (\u03a9c , \u03a9c r \u03b3) =\n\n\u03b3\u2208kc\n\nX\n\ni(\u03b3)\n\n\u03b3\u2208kc\n\nthat proves (33). As usual by a limiting process we prove (34).\n10\n\n\fRemark 4.4. Following the proof of the above theorem, it's easy to see that, if\nkc = {\u03b3}, then i(kc ) = i(\u03b3), so the definition of index for a geodesic and for a\ncritical set are compatible.\nBy the index we can also define the multiplicity of a critical point.\nDefinition 4.5. Let \u03b3 an isolated critical point of energy. Then\nmult(\u03b3) = i(\u03b3)|\u03bb=1 .\nIt is well known that the geodesics with high multiplicity are unstable in\nsmooth manifolds, i.e. up to small perturbations of extremal points p and q we\ncan find only isolated geodesics, that have multiplicity 1. For conical manifolds\nthis is false.\nWe will show in the next example, that in some cases, given p, q on a conical\nmanifold M , there exists a geodesic \u03b30 with mult(\u03b30 ) > 1 joining them; for\na sufficiently small change of the boundary data p, q we will obtain another\ngeodesic with the same multiplicity of \u03b30 .\nExample. Let C be a 2-dimensional Euclidean half cone embedded in R3 ; let\np, q be two points of C and let v be its vertex. We want to estimate the number\nof standard geodesics between p and q.\n\nv\np\nq(n)\nq\n\np(n)\np'\nq' p''\n\nq''\n\nFigure 2: Geodesic on a Cone.\nWe represent C as a circular sector in the plane: let \u03b1 be the wideness of\nthe sector; we see that, if \u03b1 is sufficiently small, there are many regular geodesic\njoining p and q (see, for instance [13, exercise 6, section 4-7]), and the number\nof these geodesics depends on p, q and \u03b1. If \u03b1 is bigger than \u03c0, on the contrary,\nwe have an unique geodesic joining p and q. We can also observe that all these\ncurves have different energies, and that they are shorter than the broken straight\nline \u03b30 , which joins p to v and v to q, as shown in Fig 2. Because the cone is\nflat, any one of these geodesics has Morse index 0. In this case classical Morse\ntheory fails, in fact P\u03bb = 1, because the cone is contractible (see lemma 3.9), so\nn\nX\n\n\u03bbm(\u03b3i ) = n = 1 + (1 + \u03bb)Q\u03bb\n\ni=1\n\n11\n\n(35)\n\n\fand so there will be at least n \u2212 1 geodesics whose Morse index is 1: this is\na contradiction. If use our definition of generalized geodesic (Definition 1.2)\nto estimate the number of critical points of energy, we see that we must consider all the classical geodesics \u03b31 ,. . . ,\u03b3n , plus the broken geodesic \u03b30 (up to\nreparametrization). The critical levels are all distinct, so every geodesic is isolated and we can apply (34), which states that Morse relations hold. These\nestimates give us that\nn + i(\u03b30 ) = 1 + (1 + \u03bb)Q\u03bb ,\n\n(36)\n\nQ\u03bb = n \u2212 1 + R\u03bb ,\n\n(37)\n\nthen\nwhere R\u03bb is a formal series with non negative coefficients.\nSo\ni(\u03b30 ) \u2265 (n \u2212 1)\u03bb,\n\n(38)\n\nand\nmult(\u03b30 ) \u2265 (n \u2212 1).\n\n(39)\n\nAs claimed, we have a geodesic \u03b30 with an high multiplicity. If we look at\nthe definition of this curve, we have obviously that mult(\u03b30 ) is stable for small\nperturbations of p and q.\nThe above example gives us also a geometrical interpretation of multiplicity,\nin fact, if we smooth C, classical Morse theory holds, and we will see exactly\nmult(\u03b30 ) geodesics appearing. We can think that, is some sense, this geodesics\naccumulates in \u03b30 .\nFurthermore mult(\u03b30 ) depends on the wideness \u03b1 and it is zero if \u03b1 > \u03c0. We\nhave a change of topology of the energy sublevels only when mult(\u03b30 ) 6= 0; this\nfact allows us another consideration that we clarify with the following example.\nExample. Let M = R2 be endowed with the usual scalar product and let v =\n(0, 0), p = (0, 1), q = (1, 0); obviously, the unique Riemannian geodesic between\np and q is the straight line pq.\nWe can also consider M as a conical manifold with vertex v, according to\ndefinition 1.1. We see that also the broken line pvq is a geodesic following\ndefinition 1.2: this fact seems artificial. By Morse relations we prove that\ni(pvq) = 0, in fact, i(pq) = 1, and P\u03bb = 1, thus\ni(pvq) + 1 = 1 + (1 + \u03bb)Q\u03bb .\n\n(40)\n\nThen even mult(pvq) = 0. The geodesic pvq, thus, does not affect the structure\nof the sublevels of energy: the multiplicity of a curve allows us to distinguish\nthe geodesics as pvq from the ones that are meaningful critical points of energy.\nThis example shows that, by the multiplicity, we also recover the geometrical\nmeaning of geodesic that we lost in the starting definitions.\n\n5\n\nComparison with weak-slope approach\n\nTo complete the our study about geodesics, we want to compare our approach\nwith Degiovanni-Marzocchi-Morbini one. These authors in [12, 18] study the\nproblem of finding geodesics in manifolds with boundary by using the weak slope\n12\n\n\ftheory; under certain hypothesis on the conical manifold, both approaches are\npossible. We'll see that there is a strong bound between these theories, and we'll\nbe able to recover a regularity result. Let M be a conical manifold embedded\nin Rn , and assume that M is the Lipschitz boundary of an open convex set\nA \u2282 Rn . Let C = Rn r A, and let p, q \u2208 M \u2282 C. We set the functional space\nX = {\u03b3 \u2208 H 1 ([0, 1], C), \u03b3(0) = p, \u03b3(1) = q},\nand we define a functional\nJ : L2 ([0, 1], Rn ) \u2192 R \u222a {\u221e},\n\u001a R1\n\n|\u03b3 0 |2\n+\u221e\n\nJ(\u03b3) =\n\n0\n\nif \u03b3 \u2208 X\notherwise,\n\n(41)\n\nin order to have the P.S. condition for every sublevel J c .\nDefinition 5.1. A curve \u03b3 is a critical point of J iff |dJ|(\u03b3) = 0, where |dJ| is\nthe weak slope introduced in [11].\nWe have that\nTheorem 5.2. Let \u03b3 \u2208 X be a critical point for J. Then\n\u2022 |\u03b3 0 | is constant almost everywhere.\n\u2022 \u2200(a, b) \u2282 [0, 1] we have that \u03b3 0 \u2208 BV ((a, b), Rn ) and there exists a finite\nBorel measure \u03bc on (a, b) and a bounded Borel function \u03bd : (a, b) \u2192 Rn\ns.t \u03bd(s) \u2208 N\u03b3(s) C (the Clarke normal cone to C) for \u03bc a.e. s \u2208 (a, b) such\nthat\nZ\nZ\nb\n\nb\n\n|\u03b3 0 |ds = \u2212\n\na\n\n\u03bd\u03b4d\u03bc\na\n\n\u2200\u03b4 \u2208 W 1,1 ((a, b), Rn ) (i.e. in a distributional sense \u03b3 00 = \u03bdd\u03bc)\nProof. This theorem is a reformulation of [12, th.3.5] and[18, th.2.10], which we\nrefer to.\nWe can prove now the following proposition, that states a link between our\napproach and weak slope one.\nProposition 5.3. Let M be a conical manifold as above, and let p, q \u2208 M . Let\nE be defined as usual in (2). Suppose that exist a \u03b3 \u2208 \u03a9 and an \u03b5 > 0 s.t. \u03b3\nc+\u03b5\nis the unique geodesic (in the sense of Definition 1.2) in the strip \u03a9c\u2212\u03b5\n, where\nc = E(\u03b3).\nIf i(\u03b3) 6= 0, then \u03b3 is a critical point of J in sense of weak slope, i.e.\n|dJ|(\u03b3) = 0. Furthermore \u03b3 has the regularity properties of theorem 5.2.\nProof. Obviously J(\u03b3) = E(\u03b3) = c. Given \u03b5 as in the hypothesis, we know that\n\u03a9c+\u03b5 6' \u03a9c\u2212\u03b5 . We can easily see that, by a convexity argument, J a ' \u03a9a for all\nc+\u03b5\na \u2208 R: thus, it must exist a \u03b2 \u2208 Jc\u2212\u03b5\ns.t. |dJ|(\u03b2) = 0 and, again by convexity,\n\u03b2([0, 1]) \u2282 M . We apply theorem 5.2 and we obtain that |\u03b2 0 | is constant a.e.,\nc+\u03b5\nthen \u03b2 is a generalized geodesics according to Definition 1.2. Also, \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a9c\u2212\u03b5\n:\nc+\u03b5\nby hypothesis, \u03b3 is the unique geodesic in \u03a9c\u2212\u03b5 , so \u03b2 = \u03b3. The proof follows\nimmediately.\n13\n\n\f6\n\nA final remark\n\nWe have introduced this theory to solve a problem arising in a natural way:\nwhat is a geodesic on a cone? Although the answer is obvious for minimal ones,\na general definition is difficult. To overrides this obstacle, we have introduced\na large class of generalized geodesics in Definition 1.2.\nAt a first sight our definition seems a little bit artificial, but the existence\nof a Morse theory and the examples provided in the last section, suggest that\nthis definition is appropriate to our purpose. Indeed, when a geodesic has a\npositive index then there is a change in the topology of energy sublevels: these\ngeneralized geodesics can be considered as critical points, at least in a topological\nsense. This fact has two peculiarities.\nFirst, a generalized geodesic is suitable for the global variational approach.\nSecond, we have a criterion to establish when a generalized geodesic is geometrically meaningful. In fact, even if our definition might introduce \"artificial\"\ngeodesics, as we have shown in Example 4, the index theory states that these\ncurves are not critical points of energy; namely, they have 0 multiplicity.\nFurthermore, if M is a conical manifolds which is a Lipschitz boundary of a\nconvex open set in Rn , a geodesic \u03b3 with non zero index is a critical point even\naccording to Degiovanni, Marzocchi and Morbini approach.\n\nReferences\n[1] Thomas Banchoff.
