We define analogues of Verma modules for finite W -algebras.\nBy the usual ideas of highest weight theory, this is a first step towards the\nclassification of finite dimensional irreducible modules. We also introduce\nan analogue of the BGG category O. Motivated by known results in type\nA, we then formulate some precise conjectures in the case of nilpotent orbits\nof standard Levi type.\n\n1. Introduction\nThere has been a great deal of recent interest in W -algebras and their representation theory. To each nilpotent element e in the Lie algebra g of a complex\nreductive algebraic group G, one can associate a finite W -algebra U (g, e). Up\nto isomorphism, this algebra depends only on the adjoint orbit G * e of e and\ncan be viewed informally as the \"universal enveloping algebra\" of the Slodowy\nslice to this orbit. Finite W -algebras were introduced into the mathematical\nliterature by Premet [P1, \u00a74]; see also [GG]. For nilpotent orbits admitting even\ngood gradings in the sense of [EK], these algebras already appeared in work of\nKostant and Lynch [K, Ly] in the context of (generalized) Whittaker modules.\nAt one extreme, U (g, 0) = U (g); at the other extreme, when e is regular, U (g, e)\nis isomorphic to the center Z(g) of U (g).\nThere is much motivation for studying the representation theory of finite\nW -algebras. For instance, through Skryabin's equivalence [S], there is a relationship between the representation theory of U (g, e) and the representation\ntheory of g. This provides an important connection between the primitive\nideals of U (g) whose associated variety contains G * e and the primitive ideals of\nU (g, e); see [P2, Theorem 3.1] and [L, Theorem 1.2.2]. In another direction, it is\nshown by Premet [P1, \u00a76] that U (g, e) gives rise to a natural non-commutative\ndeformation of the singular variety that arises by intersecting the Slodowy slice\nto the orbit G * e with the nilpotent cone of g.\nIn mathematical physics, finite W -algebras and their affine counterparts have\nattracted a lot of attention under a slightly different guise; see for example\n[BT, VD, A, DK]. It has recently been proved in [D3 HK] that the definition in\nthe mathematical physics literature via BRST cohomology agrees with Premet's\ndefinition; see the discussion in \u00a72.3.\nFor the case G = GLN (C), the first and third authors made a thorough\nstudy of the finite dimensional representation theory of U (g, e) in [BK2]. In\nthis case U (g, e) is isomorphic to a quotient of a shifted Yangian [BK1]. Using\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification: 17B10, 81R05.\nThe first and third authors supported by the NSF grant DMS-0654147.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nJ. BRUNDAN, S. M. GOODWIN AND A. KLESHCHEV\n\nthis connection and the natural triangular decomposition of shifted Yangians,\nwe developed a highest weight theory for U (g, e), leading to the classification\nof finite dimensional irreducible U (g, e)-modules; see [BK2, \u00a77.2]. On the other\nhand, using Premet's definition of U (g, e) and the so-called Whittaker functor,\nwe obtained character formulae for the finite dimensional irreducibles as a consequence of the Kazhdan\u2013Lusztig conjecture for a certain parabolic category\nO attached to g; see [BK2, \u00a78.5]. This type A theory has already had several\nother quite striking applications; see [B1, B2, BK3].\nIn the general case there is little concrete knowledge about representations\nof U (g, e). It has only recently been proved that U (g, e) always has \"enough\"\nfinite dimensional irreducible representations; see [P3, Theorem 1.1] and [L,\nTheorem 1.2.3]. The purpose of this paper is to set up the framework to study\nrepresentation theory of U (g, e) via highest weight theory. In particular, we\ndefine Verma modules for U (g, e), which turns out to be surprisingly non-trivial.\nRecall in classical Lie theory that Verma modules are \"parabolically induced\"\nfrom irreducible representations of a Cartan subalgebra. The main problem\nfor finite W -algebras is to find a suitable algebra to play the role of Cartan\nsubalgebra. It turns out that this role is played by the \"smaller\" finite W algebra U (g0 , e) where g0 is a minimal Levi subalgebra of g containing e, i.e. e\nis a distinguished nilpotent element of g0 ; see \u00a74.1. Given a parametrization\n{V\u039b | \u039b \u2208 L}\nof a complete set of pairwise inequivalent finite dimensional irreducible U (g0 , e)modules, we will construct the Verma modules\n{M (\u039b, e) | \u039b \u2208 L}\nfor U (g, e) by parabolically inducing the V\u039b 's from U (g0 , e) to U (g, e); see \u00a74.2.\nWe then prove as usual that the Verma module M (\u039b, e) has a unique irreducible\nquotient L(\u039b, e) and that the L(\u039b, e)'s parametrized by the subset\nL+ := {\u039b \u2208 L | dim L(\u039b, e) < \u221e}\ngive a complete set of pairwise inequivalent finite dimensional irreducible U (g, e)modules. Incidentally, all our Verma modules belong to a natural category O(e)\nwhose objects have composition series with only the L(\u039b, e)'s as composition\nfactors; see \u00a74.4. In the case e = 0 this category O(e) is the usual BernsteinGelfand-Gelfand category O from [BGG].\nThe general principles just described reduce the problem of classifying the\nfinite dimensional irreducible U (g, e)-modules to two major problems:\n(1) Find a natural parametrization of the finite dimensional irreducible\nU (g0 , e)-modules by some explicit labelling set L.\n(2) Describe the subset L+ of L combinatorially.\nWe remark that the definition of Verma module, hence the subset L+ of L,\ndepends essentially on a choice of positive roots in the restricted root system of\nU (g, e) in the sense of [BG, \u00a72]. Unlike in the classical situation there is often\nmore that one conjugacy classes of such choices. The combinatorial description\nof the subset L+ will certainly depend in a significant way on this choice.\n\n\fFINITE W -ALGEBRAS\n\n3\n\nIn the special case that e is of standard Levi type, i.e. e is actually a regular\nnilpotent element of g0 , Kostant showed in [K, \u00a72] that U (g0 , e) is canonically\nisomorphic to Z(g0 ). Hence in this case the solution to problem (1) is very\nsimple: the set L labelling our Verma modules can be naturally identified with\nthe set t\u2217 /W0 of W0 -orbits in t\u2217 , where W0 is the Weyl group of g0 with respect\nto a maximal toral subalgebra t. This resembles a result of Friedlander and\nParshall [FP, Corollary 3.5] giving a similar labelling of irreducible representations for reduced enveloping algebras of standard Levi type in characteristic\np. In \u00a75.1 we formulate two explicit conjectures concerning the standard Levi\ntype case. The first of these conjectures reduces the solution of problem (2)\nto the combinatorics of associated varieties of primitive ideals in g. We prove\nthis conjecture in type A (for a standard choice of positive roots) in \u00a75.2, by\ntranslating the results from [BK2] into the general framework. Our second conjecture is quite a bit stronger, and was inspired by Premet's ideas in [P2, \u00a77]. It\npredicts an explicit link between our category O(e) and another category O(\u03c7)\nintroduced by Mili\u010d\u0131\u0301c and Soergel [MS]. This conjecture also implies the truth\nof the Kazhdan\u2013Lusztig conjecture for finite W -algebras of standard Levi type\nfrom [VD]. We speculate for e of standard Levi type that every primitive ideal\nof U (g, e) is the annihilator of an irreducible highest weight module in O(e),\nthough we have no evidence for this beyond Duflo's theorem in the case e = 0.\nThe rest of the article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we explain in\ndetail the relationship between three quite different definitions of finite W algebra. The key to the new results in this paper actually comes from the third\nof these definitions, namely, the BRST cohomology definition as formulated in\n[DK]. We point out especially Theorem 2.8 which makes the link between the\nsecond and third definitions quite transparent. In Section 3 we survey various\nresults of Premet describing the associated graded algebra to U (g, e) in its two\nnatural filtrations, setting up more essential notation along the way. The main\nnew results of the paper are proved in Section 4, the most important being\nTheorem 4.3. Finally in Section 5 we discuss standard Levi type and explain\nhow to translate the type A results from [BK2].\nWe work throughout over the ground field C. By a character of a Lie algebra\ng we mean a Lie algebra homomorphism \u03c1 : g \u2192 C. Any such \u03c1 induces a shift\nautomorphism\nS\u03c1 : U (g) \u2192 U (g)\nof the universal enveloping algebra U (g) with S\u03c1 (x) := x + \u03c1(x) for each x \u2208 g.\nAcknowledgements.

Three definitions of finite W -algebras\nIn this section we give three equivalent definitions of the finite W -algebra\nU (g, e). The first two of these definitions have left- and right-handed versions\n\n\f4\n\nJ. BRUNDAN, S. M. GOODWIN AND A. KLESHCHEV\n\nwhich are not obviously isomorphic; we establish that they are indeed isomorphic using the third definition. Although not used here, we point out that\nthere is also now a fourth important definition of the finite W -algebra, namely,\nLosev's definition via Fedosov quantization; see [L, \u00a73].\n2.1. Definition via Whittaker models. Let g be the Lie algebra of a connected reductive algebraic group G over C. Let e \u2208 g be a nilpotent element.\nBy the Jacobson\u2013Morozov theorem, we can find h, f \u2208 g so that (e, h, f ) is an\nsl2 -triple in g, i.e. [h, e] = 2e, [h, f ] = \u22122f and [e, f ] = h. We write ge , gf\nand gh for the centralizers of e, f and h in g, respectively. Then gh \u2229 ge is a\nLevi factor of ge . Pick a maximal toral subalgebra te of this Levi factor, and a\nmaximal toral subalgebra t of g containing te and h. So te is the centralizer of\ne in t. Assume in addition that we are given a good grading\nM\ng=\ng(j)\nj\u2208Z\n\nL\nfor e that is compatible with t, i.e. e \u2208 g(2), ge \u2286\nj\u22650 g(j) and t \u2286 g(0).\nGood gradings for e are classified in [EK]; see also [BG]. As h \u2208 t we have\nh \u2208 g(0) and, by [BG, Lemma 19], it is automatically\nthe case that f \u2208 g(\u22122).\nP\nAny element x \u2208 g decomposes as x =\nj\u2208Z x(j) with x(j) \u2208 g(j); we let\nP\nP\nx(< 0) := j<0 x(j) and x(\u2265 0) := j\u22650 x(j). From now on, we abbreviate\nM\nM\nM\np :=\ng(j), m :=\ng(j), n :=\ng(j), h := g(0), k := g(\u22121).\nj\u22650\n\nj\u2264\u22122\n\nj<0\n\nIn particular, p is a parabolic subalgebra of g with Levi factor h and n is the\nnilradical of the opposite parabolic. If the subspace k is non-zero then it is not\na subalgebra of g. If it is zero then the good grading is necessarily even, i.e.\ng(j) = {0} for all odd j.\nLet (.|.) be a non-degenerate symmetric invariant bilinear form on g, inducing\nnon-degenerate forms on t and t\u2217 in the usual way. Define a linear map\n\u03c7 : g \u2192 C,\n\nx 7\u2192 (e|x).\n\nAlso let h.|.i be the non-degenerate symplectic form on k defined by\nhx|yi := \u03c7([y, x]).\nNote that \u03c7 restricts to a character of m. Let I (resp. I) be the left (resp. right)\nideal of U (g) generated by the elements {x \u2212 \u03c7(x) | x \u2208 m}. Set\n(resp. Q := U (g)/I),\n\nQ := U (g)/I\n\nwhich is a left (resp. right) U (g)-module by the regular action. The adjoint\naction of n on U (g) leaves the subspace I (resp. I) invariant, so induces a\nwell-defined adjoint action of n on Q (resp. Q) such that\n[x, u + I] := [x, u] + I\nfor x \u2208 n, u \u2208 U (g). Let\nThen\n\nQn\n\n(resp. [x, u + I] := [x, u] + I)\nn\n\n(resp. Q ) be the corresponding invariant subspace.\n\n(x \u2212 \u03c7(x))(u + I) = [x, u + I]\n\n(resp. (u + I)(x \u2212 \u03c7(x)) = \u2212[x, u + I])\n\n\fFINITE W -ALGEBRAS\n\n5\n\nfor all x \u2208 m, u \u2208 U (g). This is all that is needed to check that the multiplication\nn\non U (g) induces a well-defined multiplication on Qn (resp. Q ):\n(u + I)(v + I) := uv + I\n\n(resp. (u + I)(v + I) := uv + I)\nn\n\nfor u + I, v + I \u2208 Qn (resp. u + I, v + I \u2208 Q ). We refer to Qn as the Whittaker\nmodel realization of the finite W -algebra associated to e and the chosen good\ngrading. Up to isomorphism, the algebra Qn is known to be independent of\nthe choice of good grading; see [BG, Theorem 1] or [L, Corollary 3.3.3]. Later\nin the section, we will construct a canonical isomorphism between Qn and the\nn\nright-handed analogue Q ; the existence of such an isomorphism is far from\nclear at this point.\nRemark 2.1. The definition of Qn just explained is not quite the same as\nPremet's definition of the finite W -algebra from [P1]. To explain the connection,\nwe need to fix in addition a Lagrangian subspace l of k with respect to the form\nh.|.i. Note that \u03c7 still restricts to a character of m \u2295 l (though it need not\nrestrict to a character of n). Let Il \u2287 I denote the left ideal of U (g) generated\nby {x \u2212 \u03c7(x) | x \u2208 m \u2295 l}. Set Ql := U (g)/Il and\nQlm\u2295l : = {u + Il \u2208 Ql | [x, u] \u2208 Il for all x \u2208 m \u2295 l}\n= {u + Il \u2208 Ql | (x \u2212 \u03c7(x))u \u2208 Il for all x \u2208 m \u2295 l}.\nAgain this inherits a well-defined algebra structure from the multiplication in\nU (g); it is even the case that\nQm\u2295l \u223c\n= EndU (g) (Ql)op .\nl\n\nQlm\u2295l\n\nThe algebra\nis exactly Premet's definition of the finite W -algebra from\n[P1]. By [GG, Theorem 4.1] the canonical quotient map Q \u0589 Ql restricts to an\nalgebra isomorphism\n\u223c\n\u03bd : Qn \u2192 Qlm\u2295l.\nHence our Whittaker model realization is equivalent to Premet's.\n2.2. Definition via non-linear Lie algebras. The next definition of the\nfinite W -algebra is based on [P2, \u00a72.4], and is the main definition that we will\nuse in the subsequent sections. To formulate it, we will use an easy special\ncase of the notion of a non-linear Lie superalgebra from [DK, Definition 3.1].\nFor the remainder of this article, a non-linear Lie superalgebra means a vector\nsuperspace a = a0\u0304 \u2295 a1\u0304 equipped with a non-linear Lie bracket [., .], that is, a\nparity preserving linear map a \u2297 a \u2192 T (a) satisfying the following conditions\nfor all homogeneous a, b, c \u2208 a:\n(1) [a, b] \u2208 C \u2295 a;\n(2) [a, b] = (\u22121)p(a)p(b) [b, a] (where p(a) \u2208 Z2 denotes parity);\n(3) [a, [b, c]] = [[a, b], c] + (\u22121)p(a)p(b) [b, [a, c]] (interpreted using the convention that any bracket with a scalar is zero).\nThis definition agrees with the general notion of non-linear Lie superalgebra\nfrom [DK, Definition 3.1] when the grading on a in the general setup is concentrated in degree 1.\n\n\f6\n\nJ. BRUNDAN, S. M. GOODWIN AND A. KLESHCHEV\n\nThe universal enveloping superalgebra of a non-linear Lie superalgebra a is\nU (a) := T (a)/M (a) where M (a) is the two-sided ideal generated by the elements\na \u2297 b \u2212 (\u22121)p(a)p(b) b \u2297 a \u2212 [a, b] for all homogeneous a, b \u2208 a. By a special case of\n[DK, Theorem 3.3], U (a) is PBW generated by a in the sense that if {xi | i \u2208 I}\nis any homogeneous ordered basis of a then the ordered monomials\n{xi1 * * * xis | s \u2265 0, i1 \u2264 * * * \u2264 is and it < it+1 if p(xit ) = 1\u0304}\ngive a basis for U (a). By a subalgebra of a non-linear Lie superalgebra a we\nmean a graded subspace b of a such that [b, b] \u2286 C \u2295 b. In that case b is itself a\nnon-linear Lie superalgebra and U (b) is identified with the subalgebra of U (a)\ngenerated by b. We call a a non-linear Lie algebra if it is purely even.\nNow return to the setup of \u00a72.1. Following the language of [DK, \u00a75] and\n[D3 HK], let\nkne = {xne | x \u2208 k}\nbe a \"neutral\" copy of k. We allow ourselves to write xne for any element x \u2208 g,\nmeaning x(\u22121)ne . Make kne into a non-linear Lie algebra with non-linear Lie\nbracket defined by\n[xne , y ne ] := hx|yi\nfor x, y \u2208 k, recalling that hx|yi = (e|[y, x]). Then U (kne ) is the Weyl algebra\nassociated to k and the symplectic form h.|.i. Let\ne\ng := g \u2295 kne\n\nviewed as a non-linear Lie algebra with bracket obtained by extending the\nbrackets already defined on g and kne to all of e\ng by declaring [x, y ne ] := 0 for\nne\nx \u2208 g, y \u2208 k. Then U (e\ng) = U (g) \u2297 U (k ). Also introduce the subalgebra\ne\np := p \u2295 kne\n\nof e\ng, whose universal enveloping algebra is identified with U (p) \u2297 U (kne ). For\nuse in \u00a73.2, we record the following crucial lemma which is proved as in [GG,\n(2.2)].\nM\nLemma 2.2. e\np = ge \u2295\n[f, g(j)] \u2295 kne .\nj\u22652\n\nExtend the left (resp. right) regular action of g on Q (resp. Q) to an action\nof e\ng by setting\nxne (u + I) := ux + I\n\n(resp. (u + I)xne := xu + I)\n\nfor u \u2208 U (g) and x \u2208 k. This makes Q into a left U (e\ng)-module (resp. Q into a\nright U (e\ng)-module). For x, y \u2208 n, we have that\n[x \u2212 \u03c7(x) \u2212 xne , y \u2212 \u03c7(y) \u2212 y ne ] = [x, y] \u2212 \u03c7([x, y]) \u2212 [x, y]ne ,\nbecause [x, y]ne = 0. Hence the map n \u2192 U (e\ng), x 7\u2192 x \u2212 \u03c7(x) \u2212 xne is a\nLie algebra homomorphism. So we can make U (e\ng) into an n-module via the\ntwisted adjoint action defined by letting x \u2208 n act as the derivation u 7\u2192 [x \u2212\n\u03c7(x) \u2212 xne , u]. Since \u03c7(x) is a scalar, this map can be written more succinctly\nas u 7\u2192 [x \u2212 xne , u].\n\n\fFINITE W -ALGEBRAS\n\n7\n\nLemma 2.3. The natural multiplication map\nU (e\ng) \u0589 Q, u 7\u2192 u(1 + I)\n\n(resp. U (e\ng) \u0589 Q, u 7\u2192 (1 + I)u)\n\nintertwines the twisted adjoint action of n on U (e\ng) with the adjoint action of n\non Q (resp. Q).\nProof. We verify this in the left-handed case, the other case being similar. We\nneed to show that [x \u2212 xne , u](1 + I) = [x, u(1 + I)] for x \u2208 n and u \u2208 U (e\ng). We\nmay assume that u = vy1ne * * * ynne for v \u2208 U (g) and y1 , . . . , yn \u2208 k. Then,\n[x \u2212 xne , u] = [x, v]y1ne * * * ynne \u2212 v[xne , y1ne * * * ynne ].\nActing on 1 + I, we get that\n[x \u2212 xne , u](1 + I) = [x, v]yn * * * y1 + v[x, yn * * * y1 ] + I\n= [x, vyn * * * y1 ] + I = [x, vyn * * * y1 + I] = [x, u(1 + I)]\nas required.\nLet J (resp. J) be the left (resp. right) ideal of U (e\ng) generated by the elements\n{x \u2212 \u03c7(x) \u2212 xne | x \u2208 n}. By the PBW theorem, we have that\nU (e\ng) = U (e\np) \u2295 J\n\n(resp.

The subspaces U (g, e) and U (g, e) are subalgebras of U (e\np), and\nthe maps\nU (g, e) \u2192 Qn, u 7\u2192 u(1 + I),\n\nn\n\nU (g, e) \u2192 Q , u 7\u2192 (1 + I)u\n\nare well-defined algebra isomorphisms.\nProof. We deal with the left-handed case, the right-handed analogue being\nsimilar. Note for x \u2208 n that (x \u2212 \u03c7(x) \u2212 xne )(1 + I) \u2286 I, so J(1 + I) \u2286 I. Hence\nPr(u)(1 + I) = u(1 + I) for every u \u2208 U (e\ng). Given this, Lemma 2.3 implies that\nPr([x \u2212 xne , u])(1 + I) = [x \u2212 xne , u](1 + I) = [x, u(1 + I)]\nfor x \u2208 n and u \u2208 U (e\np). By the PBW theorem, the map U (e\np) \u2192 Q, u 7\u2192 u(1+I)\nis a vector space isomorphism. Putting our observations together, u \u2208 U (e\np)\n\u223c\nbelongs to U (g, e) if and only if u(1+I) belongs to Qn. Thus the map U (e\np) \u2192 Q\n\u223c\nrestricts to a vector space isomorphism\nU (g, e) \u2192 QnP\n.\nP\nne\nne\nne and\nNow take general elements x ux xne\n*\n*\n*\nx\ns\n1\ny vy y1 * * * yt in U (g, e)\nfor ux , vy \u2208 U (p) and x1 , . . . , xs , y1 , . . . , yt \u2208 k. The image in Q of their product\nin U (e\np) is equal to\nP\nx,y ux vy yt * * * y1 xs * * * x1 + I.\nWe claim that this is equal to the product of their images in Qn, namely,\nP\nx,y ux xs * * * x1 vy yt * * * y1 + I.\n\n\f8\n\nJ. BRUNDAN, S. M. GOODWIN AND A. KLESHCHEV\n\nP\nTo see this, note that y vy yt * * * y1 + I belongs to Qn. Hence for each i the\nP\ncommutator [xi , y vy yt * * * y1 ] belongs to I. Also observe that Ixi\u22121 * * * x1 \u2286 I.\nUsing these two facts applied successively to i = 1, . . . , s, we get that\nX\nX\nvy yt * * * y1 + I =\nvy y t * * * y 1 x s * * * x 1 + I\nxs * * * x1\ny\n\ny\n\nand the claim follows.\nThe claim shows that the product of two elements in U (g, e) is again an\nelement of U (g, e), because the image of the product lies in Qn. Hence U (g, e)\nis indeed a subalgebra of U (e\np). At the same time, the claim establishes that\nour vector space isomorphism is actually an algebra isomorphism.\nWe refer to U (g, e) simply as the finite W -algebra associated to e.\n\n2.3. Definition via BRST cohomology. We now turn to the third definition\nof the W -algebra. This has been proved to be equivalent to the Whittaker model\ndefinition above in [D3 HK]. Let\nnch = {xch | x \u2208 n}\nbe a \"charged\" copy of n. As before, we allow ourselves to write xch for any\nx \u2208 g, meaning x(< 0)ch . Recalling that e\ng = g \u2295 kne , let\nb\ng := e\ng \u2295 n\u2217 \u2295 nch\n\nviewed as a non-linear Lie superalgebra with even part equal to e\ng, odd part\nequal to n\u2217 \u2295 nch , and non-linear Lie bracket [., .] defined as follows. It is equal\nto the non-linear Lie bracket defined above on e\ng. It is identically zero on n\u2217 , nch\nor between elements of e\ng and n\u2217 \u2295nch . Finally [f, xch ] := hf, xi for f \u2208 n\u2217 , x \u2208 n,\nwhere hf, xi denotes the natural pairing of f \u2208 n\u2217 with x \u2208 n. We also have the\nsubalgebra\nb\np := e\np \u2295 n\u2217 \u2295 nch\nof b\ng. We put the cohomological grading on b\ng, hence also on b\np, consistent with\nthe Z2 -grading, by declaring that elements of e\ng are in degree 0, elements of n\u2217\nare in degree 1, and elements of nch are in degree \u22121.

As usual, we just prove the left-handed version. By definition,\nU (g, e) = {u \u2208 U (e\np) | Pr([bi \u2212 bne\ni , u]) = 0 for each i = 1, . . . , r}.\n\nThe injectivity\nPr([bi \u2212 bne\ni , u]) = 0 for each i = 1, . . . , r if\nPr of \u03c6, implies that\nne\nand only if i=1 fi \u03c6(Pr([bi \u2212 bi , u])) = 0. By Lemma 2.7, this is precisely the\nstatement that d(\u03c6(u)) = 0. In particular, this shows that \u03c6(U (g, e)) \u2286 ker d.\nFinally, recalling the commutative diagram immediately before Lemma 2.5, we\nconsider the induced commutative diagram\n\u03c6(U (g, e)) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 H \u2022 (U (b\ng), d)\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\npy\nyq\n\u223c\n\nU (g, e) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nQn\nwhere the top map is the map u 7\u2192 u + ker d. The left hand map is an isomorphism by Lemma 2.6. We have already observed, the right hand map is an\nisomorphism by [D3 HK]. Hence the top map is an isomorphism too, showing\nthat ker d = \u03c6(U (g, e)) \u2295 im d.\n\nWe are now in a position to give the promised explicit isomorphism between\nU (g, e) and U (g, e).\nCorollary 2.9. The restrictions of the automorphisms S\u00b1\u03b2 of U (e\np) define mutually inverse algebra isomorphisms\n\u223c\n\nS\u03b2 : U (g, e) \u2192 U (g, e),\n\n\u223c\n\nS\u2212\u03b2 : U (g, e) \u2192 U (g, e).\n\nProof. By Theorem 2.8, d(\u03c6(U (g, e))) = {0} and d(\u03c6(U (g, e))) = {0}. Thus\nby Lemma 2.6, d(\u03c6(S\u03b2 (U (g, e)))) = {0}. So by Theorem 2.8 again, we have\nS\u03b2 (U (g, e)) \u2286 U (g, e). Similarly, we have S\u2212\u03b2 (U (g, e)) \u2286 U (g, e).\n\n\f14\n\nJ. BRUNDAN, S. M. GOODWIN AND A. KLESHCHEV\n\nUsing Corollary 2.9 it is an easy matter to translate statements about U (g, e)\ninto analogous statements about U (g, e). So for the remainder of the article we\nwill just formulate things in the left-handed case.\n3. Associated graded algebras\nFinite W -algebras possess two important filtrations. In this section we review the fundamental theorems describing the corresponding associated graded\nalgebras; almost all of these results are due to Premet [P1, P2].\nL\n3.1. Restricted roots. For \u03b1 \u2208 (te )\u2217 , let g\u03b1 =\nj\u2208Z g\u03b1 (j) denote the \u03b1e\nweight space of g with respect to t . So\nM\ng = g0 \u2295\ng\u03b1\n\u03b1\u2208\u03a6e\n\nwhere \u03a6e \u2282 (te )\u2217 denotes the set of non-zero weights of te on g. Similarly each\nof the spaces p, m, n, h and k decomposes into te -weight spaces. In the language\nof [BG, \u00a72], \u03a6e is a restricted root system. It is not a root system in the usual\nsense; for example, for \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6e there may be multiples of \u03b1 other than \u00b1\u03b1 that\nbelong to \u03a6e . There is an induced restricted root decomposition\nM\nge = ge0 \u2295\nge\u03b1\n\u03b1\u2208\u03a6e\n13], \u03a6e is\n\nge .\n\nof the centralizer\nBy [BG, Lemma L\nalso the set of non-zero weights\ne\ne\ne\ne\nof t on g , so all the subspaces g\u03b1 =\nj\u22650 g\u03b1 (j) in this decomposition are\nnon-zero. Moreover ge\u03b1 (j) is of the same dimension as ge\u2212\u03b1 (j); if j = 0 this\ndimension is either 0 or 1, but for j > 0 the space ge\u03b1 (j) can be bigger.\nRecall that te is contained in he = ge (0). We define a dot action of he , hence\nalso of te , on the vector space b\ng by setting\nt * x := [t, x],\n\nt * y ne := [t, y]ne ,\n\nt * z ch := [t, z]ch ,\n\nht * f, zi := \u2212hf, [t, z]i\n\nfor t \u2208 he , x \u2208 g, y \u2208 k, z \u2208 n and f \u2208 n\u2217 . Using the following lemma, it is routine\nto check that this extends uniquely to an action of te on U (b\ng) by derivations.\nMoreover the dot action leaves all the subspaces b\np, e\np and ge invariant, so there\nare induced dot actions on U (b\np), U (e\np) and U (ge ) too.\nLemma 3.1. The adjoint action of he on k preserves the form h.|.i.\nProof. We calculate\nh[t, x]|yi + hx|[t, y]i = \u03c7([y, [t, x]] + [[t, y], x]) = \u03c7([t, [y, x]])\n= (e|[t, [y, x]]) = ([e, t]|[y, x]] = 0,\nfor t \u2208\n\nhe\n\nand x, y \u2208 k.\n\nLet Z\u03a6e denote the Z-submodule of (te )\u2217 generated by \u03a6e . Using the dot action of te we can also decompose all of the universal enveloping (super)algebras\nU (b\ng), U (b\np), U (e\np) and U (ge ) into weight spaces. For example:\nM\nU (e\np) =\nU (e\np)\u03b1\n\u03b1\u2208Z\u03a6e\n\n\fFINITE W -ALGEBRAS\n\n15\n\nwhere U (e\np)\u03b1 = {u \u2208 U (e\np) | t * u = \u03b1(t)u for all t \u2208 te }. Recall the W -algebra\nU (g, e) is a subalgebra of U (e\np).\n\nLemma 3.2. The dot action of he on U (e\np) leaves U (g, e) invariant.\n\nProof. We first check that t * J \u2286 J for t \u2208 he . For this we need to show for any\nx \u2208 n that t * (x \u2212 \u03c7(x) \u2212 xne ) belongs to J. We have that \u03c7([t, x]) = (e|[t, x]) =\n([e, t]|x) = 0 as t centralizes e. Hence,\nt * (x \u2212 \u03c7(x) \u2212 xne ) = [t, x] \u2212 [t, x]ne = [t, x] \u2212 \u03c7([t, x]) \u2212 [t, x]ne \u2208 J.\n\nNow to prove the lemma, we take u \u2208 U (g, e), so [x \u2212 xne , u] \u2208 J for all x \u2208 n.\nWe need to show for t \u2208 he that [x \u2212 xne , t * u] \u2208 J for all x \u2208 n too. Using the\nLeibniz rule, we have that\nt *[x\u2212 xne , u] = [t *(x\u2212 xne ), u]+ [x\u2212 xne , t *u] = [[t, x]\u2212 [t, x]ne , u]+ [x\u2212 xne , t *u].\nAs [t, x] \u2208 n, we know already that [[t, x] \u2212 [t, x]ne , u] \u2208 J. As [x \u2212 xne , u] \u2208 J,\nwe deduce that t * [x \u2212 xne , u] \u2208 J too. Hence [x \u2212 xne , t * u] \u2208 J as required.\nHence the dot action of te induces a restricted root space decomposition of\nU (g, e):\nM\nU (g, e) =\nU (g, e)\u03b1 .\n\u03b1\u2208Z\u03a6e\n\nActually, we can do rather better: the following theorem due to Premet constructs a canonical embedding of te into U (g, e) such that the dot action of te on\nU (g, e) coincides with its adjoint action via this embedding. This means that\nte also acts on any U (g, e)-module; we will use this later on to define weight\nspace decompositions of U (g, e)-modules compatible with the above restricted\nroot space decomposition. To formulate the theorem following [P2, \u00a72.5], let\nz1 , . . . , z2s be a symplectic basis for k, so that hzi |zj\u2217 i = \u03b4i,j for all 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 2s\nwhere\n\u001a\nzj+s for j = 1, . . . , s,\n\u2217\nzj :=\n\u2212zj\u2212s for j = s + 1, . . . , 2s.\nTheorem 3.3. There is a te -equivariant linear map \u03b8 : ge \u0592\u2192 U (e\np) such that\n\u001a\nP\n\u2217 ne ne if x \u2208 he ,\nx + 12 2s\ni=1 [x, zi ] zi\n\u03b8(x) =\nx\notherwise,\nfor each homogeneous element x \u2208 ge . The map \u03b8 does not depend on the choice\nof basis z1 , . . . , z2s . Moreover:\n(1) [\u03b8(x), u] = x * u for any x \u2208 he and u \u2208 U (e\np);\ne\n(2) [\u03b8(x), \u03b8(y)] = \u03b8([x, y]) for each x, y \u2208 g ;\n(3) \u03b8(x) belongs to U (g, e) for every x \u2208 he .\nProof. This is proved in [P2, \u00a72.5] but we repeat the details since our setup\nis slightly different. It is routine that \u03b8 is independent of the choice of the\nsymplectic basis. Moreover, as the symplectic form on k is te -invariant, we\nmay choose the symplectic basis to be a te -weight basis with the weight of zi\nbeing the negative of the weight of zi\u2217 for each i. It is then clear that \u03b8 is\nte -equivariant.\n\n\f16\n\nJ. BRUNDAN, S. M. GOODWIN AND A. KLESHCHEV\n\nWe next check (1) for a fixed x \u2208 he . Both the maps u 7\u2192 [\u03b8(x), u] and\nu 7\u2192 x * u are derivations, so it suffices to check that [\u03b8(x), y] = x * y for each\ny \u2208 p and that [\u03b8(x), (zj\u2217 )ne ] = x * (zj\u2217 )ne for each j = 1, . . . , 2s. The first of\nthese statements is obvious, since both [\u03b8(x), y] and x * y equal [x, y]. For the\nsecond, we calculate using Lemma 3.1:\nP\n[\u03b8(x), (zj\u2217 )ne ] = 21 i h[x, zi\u2217 ]|zj\u2217 izine + 12 [x, zj\u2217 ]ne\nP\n= 21 i h[x, zj\u2217 ]|zi\u2217 izine + 12 [x, zj\u2217 ]ne = [x, zj\u2217 ]ne .\n\nFor (2), take homogeneous x, y \u2208 ge . If x or y belongs to ge (j) for some j > 0\nthen (2) is obvious so assume x, y \u2208 he . Then using (1) we get\nP\nP\n[\u03b8(x), \u03b8(y)] = x * \u03b8(y) = [x, y] + 12 i [x, [y, zi\u2217 ]]ne zine + 21 i [y, zi\u2217 ]ne [x, zi ]ne .\nNow we simplify the last term:\nP\nP\n\u2217 ne\nne = \u2212\n[y, zi ]ne [x, zi\u2217 ]ne\ni [y, zi ] [x, zi ]\nPi\n= \u2212 i,j h[x, zi\u2217 ]|zj\u2217 i[y, zi ]ne zjne\nP\n= \u2212 i,j h[x, zj\u2217 ]|zi\u2217 i[y, zi ]ne zjne\nP\n= \u2212 i [y, [x, zi\u2217 ]]ne zine\nP\nP\n= i [[x, y], zi\u2217 ]ne zine \u2212 i [x, [y, zi\u2217 ]]ne zine .\n\nThus\n\nP\n[\u03b8(x), \u03b8(y)] = [x, y] + 12 i [[x, y], zi\u2217 ]ne zine = \u03b8([x, y]).\nTo check (3), take x \u2208 he . We need to show that [y \u2212 y ne , \u03b8(x)] \u2208 J for all\ny \u2208 n. If y \u2208 m, then [y \u2212 y ne , \u03b8(x)] = [y, x] \u2208 J, as \u03c7([y, x]) = 0 using the fact\nthat x \u2208 ge . If instead y \u2208 k, then using (1) we have that\n[y \u2212 y ne , \u03b8(x)] = [y, x] + [\u03b8(x), y ne ] = [y, x] + x * y ne\n= [y, x] + [x, y]ne = [y, x] \u2212 \u03c7([y, x]) \u2212 [y, x]ne\nwhich does belong to J.\nRemark 3.4. One can modify the map \u03b8 in Theorem 3.3 by composing with an\nautomorphism of U (e\np) of the form x 7\u2192 x+ \u03b7(x), y ne 7\u2192 y ne for some character \u03b7\nof p. Providing the character \u03b4 in \u00a74.1 below is replaced by \u03b4 \u2212 \u03b7, all subsequent\nresults remain true exactly as formulated for \u03b8 modified in this way. This extra\ndegree of freedom will be useful when we discuss type A in \u00a75.2 below.\n3.2. The Kazhdan filtration. Now we introduce the first important filtration, working to start with in terms of the Whittaker model realization Qn of\nthe W -algebra following [GG]. The Kazhdan filtration\n* * * \u2286 Fi U (g) \u2286 Fi+1 U (g) \u2286 * * *\non U (g) is defined by declaring that x \u2208 g(j) is of Kazhdan degree (j + 2).\nSo Fi U (g) is the span of the monomials x1 * * * xn for n \u2265 0 and x1 \u2208 g(j1 ),\n. . . , xn \u2208 g(jn ) such that (j1 + 2) + * * * + (jn + 2) \u2264 i. The associated graded\nalgebra gr U (g) is the symmetric algebra S(g) viewed as a graded algebra via\nthe Kazhdan grading on g in which x \u2208 g(j) is of degree (j + 2).\n\n\fFINITE W -ALGEBRAS\n\n17\n\nThe Kazhdan filtration on U (g) induces a filtration on the left ideal I and on\nthe quotient Q = U (g)/I such that gr Q = S(g)/ gr I. We use the bilinear form\n(.|.) to identify S(g) with the algebra C[g] of regular functions on the affine\nvariety g. Then gr I is the ideal generated by the functions {x \u2212 \u03c7(x) | x \u2208 m},\ni.e. the ideal of all functions in C[g] vanishing on the closed subvariety e + m\u22a5\nof g. In this way, we have identified\ngr Q = C[e + m\u22a5 ].\nLet N be the closed subgroup of G corresponding to the subalgebra n. The\nadjoint action of N on g leaves e + m\u22a5 invariant, so we get induced an action\nof N on C[e + m\u22a5 ] by automorphisms; the resulting action of n on C[e + m\u22a5 ]\nby derivations coincides under the above identification with the action of n on\ngr Q induced by the adjoint action of n on Q itself. By [GG, Lemma 2.1], the\naction of N on e + m\u22a5 is regular and the Slodowy slice\ne + gf \u2286 e + m \u22a5\ngives a set of representatives for the orbits of N on e + m\u22a5 . So restriction of\nfunctions defines an isomorphism from the invariant subalgebra C[e+m\u22a5 ]N onto\nC[e + gf ]. Finally, the Kazhdan filtration on Q induces an algebra filtration on\nQn so that gr(Qn) is identified with a graded subalgebra of gr Q = C[e + m\u22a5 ].\nNow the PBW theorem for Qn [GG, Theorem 4.1] gives:\ngr(Qn) = C[e + m\u22a5 ]N \u223c\n= C[e + gf ].\nThe next goal is to reformulate this PBW theorem for U (g, e) directly. To do\nthis, extend the Kazhdan filtration on U (g) to U (e\ng) by declaring that elements\nne\ne\ne\nof k are of degree 1. Setting Fi U (p) := U (p) \u2229 Fi U (e\ng), we get an induced\nKazhdan filtration on the subalgebra U (e\np). We can obviously identify gr U (e\ng)\nand gr U (e\np) with S(e\ng) and S(e\np), both graded via the analogous Kazhdan grading\nin which x \u2208 g(j) is of Kazhdan degree j + 2 and y ne \u2208 kne is of Kazhdan\ndegree 1. The Kazhdan grading on e\np only involves positive degrees, so the\nKazhdan filtration on U (e\np) is strictly positive in the sense that F0 U (e\np) = C\nand Fi U (e\np) = 0 for i < 0. We get an induced strictly positive filtration\nF0 U (g, e) \u2286 F1 U (g, e) \u2286 * * *\n\non U (g, e) such that gr U (g, e) is canonically identified with a graded subalgebra\nof gr U (e\np) = S(e\np).

The algebra\n\u223c\nhomomorphisms S(e\ng) \u0589 C[e + m\u22a5 ] and S(e\np) \u2192 C[e + m\u22a5 ] are induced by the\n\n\f18\n\nJ. BRUNDAN, S. M. GOODWIN AND A. KLESHCHEV\n\n\u223c\nmultiplication maps U (e\ng) \u0589 Q, u 7\u2192 u(1 + I) and U (e\np) \u2192 Q, u 7\u2192 u(1 + I), on\npassing to the associated graded objects. Explicitly, they send x \u2208 g or p to\nthe function z 7\u2192 (x|z) and y ne \u2208 kne to the function z 7\u2192 (y|z).\nThe homomorphism pr : S(e\ng) \u0589 S(e\np) is induced by Pr : U (e\ng) \u0589 U (e\np)\non passing to the associated graded algebras. Explicitly, pr is the identity on\nelements of e\np and maps x \u2208 n to \u03c7(x) + xne . The top triangle in the diagram\ncommutes even before passing to the associated graded objects, as we observed\nthat Pr(u)(1 + I) = u(1 + I) for u \u2208 U (e\ng) in the proof of Theorem 2.4.\nThe twisted adjoint action of n on U (e\ng) induces a graded action of n on\nS(e\ng) by derivations, such that x \u2208 n maps y \u2208 e\ng to [x \u2212 xne , y]. This action\nfactors through the map pr to induce an action of n on S(e\np) by derivations,\nne\nn\ne\ne\nsuch that x \u2208 n maps y \u2208 p to pr([x\u2212x , y]). We let S(p) denote the invariant\nsubalgebra for this action.\nBy Lemma 2.3, the map S(e\ng) \u0589 C[e + m\u22a5 ] intertwines the twisted adjoint\naction of n on S(e\ng) with the action of n on C[e + m\u22a5 ] derived from the action\n\u223c\nof the group N . Hence the map S(e\np) \u2192 C[e + m\u22a5 ] restricts to an isomorphism\n\u223c\nS(e\np)n \u2192 C[e + m\u22a5 ]N . By Theorem 2.4 and the PBW theorem for Qn, the\n\u223c\nisomorphism S(e\np) \u2192 C[e + m\u22a5 ] maps gr U (g, e) isomorphically onto gr(Qn) =\nC[e + m\u22a5 ]N . This shows that gr U (g, e) = S(e\np)n.\nLet \u03b6 : S(e\np) \u0589 S(ge ) be the homomorphism induced by the projection e\np \u0589 ge\nalong the decomposition from Lemma 2.2. We have that\n\nL\n\n([f, x]|z) = (x|[z, f ]) = (x|[e, f ]) = (x|h) = 0\n\nf\nfor all x \u2208\nj\u22651 g(j) and z \u2208 e + g . So the image of any element of ker \u03b6\n\u223c\nunder the isomorphism S(e\np) \u2192 C[e + m\u22a5 ] annihilates e + gf . Hence there is an\ninduced homomorphism S(ge ) \u2192 C[e + gf ] making the bottom square in the\ndiagram commute. This homomorphism maps x \u2208 ge to the function z 7\u2192 (x|z),\nfrom which it is easy to check that it is actually an isomorphism.\nFinally, we have already noted that the map res sends C[e + m\u22a5 ]N isomorphically onto the coordinate algebra C[e + gf ] of the Slodowy slice. So the\n\u223c\nrestriction of \u03b6 gives an isomorphism S(e\np)n \u2192 S(ge ). This completes the justification of the above diagram, and we have now derived the following convenient\nreformulation of [GG, Theorem 4.1]:\n\nLemma 3.5. We have that gr U (g, e) = S(e\np)n. Moreover, the restriction of \u03b6\nis an isomorphism of graded algebras\n\u223c\n\n\u03b6 : S(e\np)n \u2192 S(ge ),\n\nwhere the grading on S(ge ) is induced by the Kazhdan grading on ge .\nThe dot action of te on e\np extends to an action on S(e\np) by derivations, which\ncoincides with the action induced by the dot action of te on U (e\np) on passing to\nthe associated graded algebra. Hence the te -weight space decomposition\nM\nS(e\np) =\nS(e\np)\u03b1\n\u03b1\u2208Z\u03a6e\n\n\fFINITE W -ALGEBRAS\n\n19\n\nsatisfies gr(U (e\np)\u03b1 ) = S(e\np)\u03b1 . In view of Lemma 3.2, U (g, e) is a te -submodule\nof U (e\np), hence gr U (g, e) = S(e\np)n is a te -submodule of S(e\np) and the induced\ndecomposition\nM\ngr U (g, e) =\nS(e\np)n\u03b1\n\u03b1\u2208Z\u03a6e\n\nS(e\np)n\u03b1 .\n\nsatisfies gr(U (g, e)\u03b1 ) =\nNow we can deduce the following PBW theorem\nfor U (g, e), which is essentially [P1, Theorem 4.6]. We remark that the original\nproof in [P1] involved lifting from characteristic p, whereas we are deducing it\nultimately from [GG, Theorem 4.1].\nTheorem 3.6. There exists a (non-unique) te -equivariant linear map\n\u0398 : ge \u0592\u2192 U (g, e)\n\nsuch that \u0398(x) \u2208 Fj+2 U (g, e) and \u03b6(grj+2 \u0398(x)) = x for each x \u2208 ge (j), and\n\u0398(t) = \u03b8(t) for each t \u2208 he . Moreover, if x1 , . . . , xt is a homogeneous basis of\nge with xi \u2208 ge (ni ) then the monomials\n{\u0398(xi1 ) . . . \u0398(xik ) | k \u2265 0, 1 \u2264 i1 \u2264 * * * \u2264 ik \u2264 t, ni1 + * * * + nik + 2k \u2264 j}\nform a basis for Fj U (g, e) (j \u2265 0).\nProof. Let x1 , . . . , xt be a basis for ge with xi \u2208 g(ni ) of te -weight \u03b3i . As\nthe decomposition from Lemma 2.2 is a direct sum of te -modules, the isomor\u223c\nphism \u03b6 : S(e\np)n \u2192 S(ge ) from Lemma 3.5 is a te -equivariant isomorphism of\nKazhdan graded vector spaces. For each i, let x\u0302i \u2208 S(e\np)n\u03b3i be the unique element with \u03b6(x\u0302i ) = xi . So x\u0302i belongs to grni +2 (U (g, e)\u03b3i ). Hence there is a lift\n\u0398(xi ) \u2208 Fni +2 U (g, e)\u03b3i with grni +2 \u0398(xi ) = x\u0302i , i.e. \u03b6(grni +2 \u0398(xi )) = xi . Moreover if ni = 0 then by Lemma 3.3(3) we know that \u03b8(xi ) \u2208 F2 U (g, e)\u03b3i and\n\u03b6(gr2 \u03b8(xi )) = xi , so we can choose \u0398(xi ) to be \u03b8(xi ). Now extend by linearity\nto obtain the desired map \u0398. The final statement then follows immediately\nfrom Lemma 3.5.\n3.3. The good filtration. Now we turn our attention to the second filtration\non U (g, e), which we refer to as the good filtration. To define it, the good grading\non p induces a grading on U (p). We extend this to the good grading\nM\nU (e\np) =\nU (e\np)(j)\nj\u22650\n\non U (e\np) by declaring that elements of kne are of degree 0. The subalgebra\nU (g, e) is not a graded subalgebra in general, but the good grading at least\ninduces the good filtration\nF\u20320 U (g, e) \u2286 F\u20321 U (g, e) \u2286 * * *\nL\non U (g, e), where F\u2032j U (g, e) = U (g, e) \u2229 i\u2264j U (e\np)(i). The associated graded\n\u2032\nalgebra gr U (g, e) is then canonically identified with a graded subalgebra of\nU (e\np). Our goal is to identify this associated graded algebra with U (ge ), a\nresult which is a slight variation on [P2, Proposition 2.1].\n\n\f20\n\nJ. BRUNDAN, S. M. GOODWIN AND A. KLESHCHEV\n\nLemma 3.7. Let \u03b8 and \u0398 be as in Theorems 3.3 and 3.6. For x \u2208 ge (j) we\nhave that \u0398(x) \u2208 F\u2032j U (g, e) and gr\u2032j \u0398(x) = \u03b8(x).\nProof. Take 0 6= x \u2208 ge (j) for j \u2265 0. Let x\u0302 \u2208 S(e\np)n be the unique element such\nthat \u03b6(x\u0302) = x. We claim to start with that\nL\nn e\nx\u0302 \u2261 x (mod\nn\u22652 S (p)).\n\nTo see this, note \u03b6 is a graded map with respect to the Kazhdan grading\nand x\nL\nn (e\nS\np))\nis in Kazhdan degree j + 2, so we certainly have that x\u0302 \u2261 y (mod\nn\u22652\nfor some unique y \u2208 g(j) with \u03b6(y) = x. Now we just need to show that\ny centralizes e, i.e. \u03b6(y) = y. If not then [e, y] 6= 0, so we can find some\nz \u2208 g(\u2212j \u2212 2) such that ([e, y]|z) 6= 0. Then\npr([y, z]) = \u03c7([y, z]) = (e|[y, z]) = ([e, y]|z) 6= 0.\nOn the other hand if x1 * * * xn is any monomial in S n (e\np) of Kazhdan degree j +2\nfor some n \u2265 2, we have that\nn\nX\nx1 * * * xi\u22121 pr([xi , z])xi+1 * * * xn .\npr([x1 * * * xn , z]) =\ni=1\n\nAs n \u2265 2 we know that xi is of Kazhdan degree strictly smaller than j + 2, so\n[xi , z] lies in g(k) for some k < \u22122. Hence pr([xi , z]) = 0 so pr([x1 * * * xn , z]) = 0\ntoo. So pr([x\u0302, z]) = pr([y, z]) 6= 0. But x\u0302 lies in S(e\np)n, so by the definition of\nthe n-action we have that pr([z, x\u0302]) = 0, giving the desired contradiction.\nNow to prove the lemma, take x \u2208 ge (j). If j = 0 then \u0398(x) = \u03b8(x) by\nTheorem 3.6, and the conclusion is clear. So assume L\nthat j > 0. We need\ne\nto show that \u0398(x) = \u03b8(x) + (\u2020) where (\u2020) belongs to\ni<j U (p)(i). By the\nclaim, the lift x\u0302 is equal to x plus a linear combination of monomials of the\nform y1 * * * yr z1ne * * * zsne for r + s \u2265 2 and elements yi \u2208 p(ki ) and zi \u2208 k with\n(k1 + 2) + * * * + (kr + 2) + s = j + 2. Hence the lift \u0398(x) of x\u0302 to U (g, e) is\nequal to x plus a linear combination of such monomials y1 * * * yr z1ne * * * zsne plus\nsome element u \u2208 Fj+1 U (e\np). Each y1 * * * yr z1ne * * * zsne is of degree k1 + * * * + kr =\nj\u22122r\u2212s+2. As r+s \u2265 2, we deduce that k1 +* * *+kr is either\nL zero or it is strictly\np)(i). Finally\nless than j, so all the y1 * * * yr z1ne * * * zsne terms belong to i<j U (e\nthe element u is itself a linear combination of monomials y1 * * * yr z1ne * * * zsne with\nyi \u2208 p(ki ) and zi \u2208 k such that (k1 + 2) + * * * + (kr + 2) + s \u2264 j + 1. Hence\nk1 + * * * + kr \u2264 j \u2212 2r \u2212 s + 1, so again we have that kL\n1 + * * * + kr is either zero\nor strictly less than j. This shows that u belongs to i<j U (e\np)(i) too.\nTheorem 3.8. The homomorphism U (ge ) \u2192 U (e\np) induced by the Lie algebra homomorphism \u03b8 from Theorem 3.3 defines a te -equivariant graded algebra\nisomorphism\n\u223c\n\u03b8 : U (ge ) \u2192 gr\u2032 U (g, e),\nviewing U (ge ) as a graded algebra via the good grading.\n\nProof. Pick \u0398 and a homogeneous basis x1 , . . . , xt for ge as in Theorem 3.6, so\nthat the monomials \u0398(xi1 ) * * * \u0398(xik ) for all 1 \u2264 i1 \u2264 * * * \u2264 ik \u2264 t form a basis\n\n\fFINITE W -ALGEBRAS\n\n21\n\nfor U (g, e). Lemma 3.7 implies that\n\u0398(xi1 ) * * * \u0398(xik ) = \u03b8(xi1 * * * xik ) + (\u2020)\nwhere the first term on the right hand side lies in U (e\np)(ni1 + * * * + nik ) and\nthe term (\u2020) lies in the sum of all strictly lower graded components. Hence the\nmonomials {\u03b8(xi1 * * * xik ) | 1 \u2264 i1 \u2264 * * * \u2264 ik \u2264 t} give a homogeneous basis\nfor gr\u2032 U (g, e). By the PBW theorem for U (ge ), the same monomials give a\nhomogeneous basis for \u03b8(U (ge )).\n4. Highest weight theory\nThis section contains the main new results of the paper. We are going to\ndefine Verma modules and explain their relevance to the problem of classifying\nfinite dimensional irreducible U (g, e)-modules.\n4.1. \"Cartan subalgebra\". Recall from \u00a73.1 thatLthe restricted root system\n\u03a6e is the set of non-zero weights of te on g = g0 \u2295 \u03b1\u2208\u03a6e g\u03b1 . The zero weight\nspace g0 is the centralizer of the toral subalgebra te in g, so it is a Levi factor of\na parabolic subalgebra of g. According to Bala\u2013Carter theory [C, 5.9.3, 5.9.4],\ne is a distinguished nilpotent element of g0 , i.e. the only semisimple elements\nof g0 that centralize e belong to the center of g0 . It is also clear that h and f\nlie in g0 .\nL\nBy [BG, Lemma 19], our fixed good grading g = j\u2208Z g(j) coincides with the\ne\neigenspace decomposition of ad (h + p) for some\nL element p \u2208 t . As p centralizes\ng0 it follows that the induced grading g0 = j\u2208Z g0 (j) coincides simply with the\nad h-eigenspace decomposition of g0 . Of course this is another good grading for\ne, viewed now as an element of the smaller reductive Lie algebra g0 . Moreover\nby [C, 5.7.6] it is an even grading, which means that e\ng0 = g0 , e\np0 = p0 , m0 = n0\nand k0 = {0}. In particular, the finite W -algebra U (g0 , e) associated to e \u2208 g0\nis defined simply by\nU (g0 , e) := {u \u2208 U (p0 ) | Pr0 ([x, u]) = 0 for all x \u2208 m0 },\nwhere I0 is the left ideal of U (g0 ) generated by the elements {x \u2212 \u03c7(x) | x \u2208 m0 },\nand Pr0 is the projection along the decomposition U (g0 ) = U (p0 ) \u2295 I0 . This\nfinite W -algebra is going to play the role of Cartan subalgebra in our highest\nweight theory. However, unlike in the case e = 0 it does not embed obviously\nas a subalgebra of U (g, e); instead we will realize it as a certain section.\nBefore we can do this, we need to fix one more critically important choice:\nlet q be a parabolic subalgebra of g with Levi factor g0 . We stress that there is\noften more than one conjugacy class of choices for q, unlike in the case e = 0\nwhen there is just one conjugacy class of Borel subalgebras containing t. In the\nlanguage of [BG, \u00a72], the choice of q determines a system \u03a6e+ of positive roots\nin the restricted root system L\n\u03a6e , namely, \u03a6e+ := {\u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6e | g\u03b1 \u2286 q}. Setting\ne\ne\n\u03a6\u2212 := \u2212\u03a6+ , we define g\u00b1 := \u03b1\u2208\u03a6e g\u03b1 , so that\n\u00b1\n\ng = g\u2212 \u2295 g0 \u2295 g+ ,\n\nq = g0 \u2295 g+ .\n\n\f22\n\nJ. BRUNDAN, S. M. GOODWIN AND A. KLESHCHEV\n\nThe choice \u03a6e+ of positive roots induces a dominance ordering \u2264 on (te )\u2217 : \u03bc \u2264 \u03bb\nif \u03bb \u2212 \u03bc \u2208 Z\u22650 \u03a6e+ .\nIn this paragraph, we let a denote one of b\ng, b\np, e\np or ge . Recall from \u00a73.1\ne\nthat the dot actions of t on a and L\nits universal enveloping (super)algebra\nU (a)\nL\nU\n(a)\ninduce decompositions a = a0 \u2295 \u03b1\u2208\u03a6e a\u03b1 and U (a) =\ne\n\u03b1 . In\n\u03b1\u2208Z\u03a6\nparticular, U (a)0 , the zero weight space of U (a) with respect to the dot action,\nis a subalgebra of U (a). Also let U (a)\u266f (resp. U (a)\u266d ) denote the left (resp. right)\nideal of U (a) generated by the root spaces a\u03b1 for \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6e+ (resp. \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6e\u2212 ). Let\nU (a)0,\u266f := U (a)0 \u2229 U (a)\u266f ,\n\nU (a)\u266d,0 := U (a)\u266d \u2229 U (a)0 ,\n\nwhich are obviously left and right ideals of U (a)0 , respectively. By the PBW\ntheorem for non-linear Lie algebras, we actually have that\nU (a)0,\u266f = U (a)\u266d,0 ,\nhence U (a)0,\u266f is a two-sided ideal of U (a)0 . Moreover a0 is a subalgebra of a,\nand by the PBW theorem again we have that U (a)0 = U (a0 ) \u2295 U (a)0,\u266f . The\nprojection along this decomposition defines a surjective algebra homomorphism\n\u03c0 : U (a)0 \u0589 U (a0 )\nwith ker \u03c0 = U (a)0,\u266f . Hence U (a)0 /U (a)0,\u266f \u223c\n= U (a0 ).\nWe can repeat some but not all of the preceding discussion for the W -algebra\nU (g, e) itself. To make things as explicit as possible, let us choose a homogeneous te -weight basis f1 , . . . , fm , h1 , . . . , hl , e1 , . . . , em of ge so that the weight\nof fi is \u2212\u03b3i \u2208 \u03a6e\u2212 , the weight of ei is \u03b3i \u2208 \u03a6e+ , and h1 , . . . , hl \u2208 ge0 ; the\nweights \u03b3i here are not necessarily distinct. Choosing an embedding \u0398 as\nin Theorem 3.6, we get the corresponding elements Fi := \u0398(fi ) \u2208 U (g, e)\u2212\u03b3i ,\na\nEi := \u0398(ei ) \u2208 U (g, e)\u03b3i , and Hj := \u0398(hj ) \u2208 U (g, e)0 . For a \u2208 Zm\n\u22650 , we write F\nm\nam , and define H b and E c for b \u2208 Zl\nfor F1a1 . . . Fm\n\u22650 and c \u2208 Z\u22650 similarly. We\nget the following PBW basis for U (g, e):\nl\n{F a H b E c | a, c \u2208 Zm\n\u22650 , b \u2208 Z\u22650 }.\n\nThe subspace U (g, e)\u03b1 in the restricted root spaceP\ndecomposition has basis given\nby all the PBW monomials F a H b E c such that i (ci \u2212 ai )\u03b3i = \u03b1.\nNow we define U (g, e)\u266f (resp. U (g, e)\u266d ) to be the left (resp. right) ideal of\nU (g, e) generated by E1 , . . . , Em (resp. F1 , . . . , Fm ). Note that U (g, e)\u266f (resp.\nU (g, e)\u266d ) is equivalently the left (resp. right) ideal of U (g, e) generated by all\nU (g, e)\u03b1 for \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6e+ (resp. \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6e\u2212 ), so it does not depend on the explicit choice\nof the basis. Set\nU (g, e)0,\u266f := U (g, e)0 \u2229 U (g, e)\u266f ,\n\nU (g, e)\u266d,0 := U (g, e)\u266d \u2229 U (g, e)0 ,\n\nwhich are obviously left and right ideals of the zero weight space U (g, e)0 ,\nrespectively. The PBW monomials F a H b E c with c 6= 0 (resp. a 6= 0) form\na basis of U (g, e)\u266f (resp.

From top to bottom, they\nhave kernels U (e\np)0,\u266f , U (b\np)0,\u266f and U (b\ng)0,\u266f . For the vertical maps, recall the\nderivation d : U (b\ng) \u2192 U (b\ng) and the homomorphism \u03c6 : U (e\np) \u2192 U (b\np) from\n\u00a72. One checks that both of these are te -equivariant, hence they restrict to give\nthe maps d and \u03c6 in the diagram. The maps d0 and \u03c60 come from the analogous\nmaps for the reductive subalgebra g0 .\nWe first verify that the top square commutes. As \u03c6 is te -invariant, it maps\nU (e\np)0,\u266f into U (b\np)0,\u266f . Hence the top square commutes on restriction to U (e\np)0,\u266f , as\ne\ne\nwe get zero both ways round. Since U (p)0 = U (p)0 \u2295 U (p)0,\u266f it remains to check\nthe square commutes on restriction to U (p0 ). So take x \u2208 p0 . Introduce the\nP\nP0\nshorthands \u00b1\nsums over all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r such that \u03b2i |te \u2208 \u03a6e\u00b1 and\ni and\ni for the\nP+\nP\nch\nb\n\u03b2i |te = 0, respectively. Both i fi [bi , x]ch and \u2212\ni [bi , x] fi belong to U (p)0,\u266f ,\nhence map to zero under \u03c0. So we get\nP\nP\nP\nch\n\u03c0(\u03c6(x)) = \u03c0(x + i fi [bi , x]ch ) = \u03c0(x + 0i fi [bi , x]ch + \u2212\ni fi [bi , x] )\nP\u2212\nP\nch\n= \u03c0(\u03c60 (x) + \u2212\ni [bi , x] fi )\ni hfi , [bi , x]i +\nP\n= \u03c60 (x) \u2212 \u2212\ni hfi , [x, bi ]i = \u03c60 (x) \u2212 \u03b3(x) = \u03c60 (S\u2212\u03b3 (\u03c0(x))).\n\nNext we check that the bottom square commutes. Again d is te -equivariant\nso maps U (b\np)0,\u266f into U (b\ng)0,\u266f , hence the bottom square commutes on restriction\nb\nto U (p)0,\u266f . It remains to check it commutes on restriction to U (b\np0 ).

The calculation in the third case is as follows:\nP\nP\nch\n\u03c0(d(y ch )) = \u03c0(y \u2212 \u03c7(y) \u2212 y ne + i fi [bi , y]ch ) = \u03c0(d0 (y ch ) + \u2212\ni fi [bi , y] )\nP\nP\u2212\nch\nch\n= d0 (y ch ) \u2212 \u03c0( \u2212\ni [bi , y] fi +\ni hfi , [y, bi ]i) = d0 (\u03c0(y )),\n\nnoting each hfi , [y, bi ]i = 0 by degree considerations.\nNow Theorem 2.8 gives that d(\u03c6(u)) = 0 for all u \u2208 U (g, e)0 . By the commutativity of the diagram we deduce that d0 (\u03c60 (S\u2212\u03b3 (\u03c0(u)))) = 0 for all such u. By\nTheorem 2.8 again, we have that U (g0 , e) = {u \u2208 U (p0 ) | d0 (\u03c60 (u)) = 0}. Hence\nS\u2212\u03b3 (\u03c0(U (g, e)0 )) \u2286 U (g0 , e), showing that the restriction of S\u2212\u03b3 \u25e6\u03c0 defines an algebra homomorphism \u03c0\u2212\u03b3 : U (g, e)0 \u2192 U (g0 , e).

Recall that the quotient U (g, e)0 /U (g, e)0,\u266f has basis\ngiven by the cosets of the PBW monomials H b with b \u2208 Zl\u22650 . Therefore to\ncomplete the proof it suffices to show that the monomials \u03c0\u2212\u03b3 (H b ) \u2208 U (g0 , e)\nactually form a basis for for U (g0 , e), since that shows simultaneously that \u03c0\u2212\u03b3\nis surjective and that its kernel is no bigger than U (g, e)0,\u266f .\nBy Lemma 3.7, H b = \u03b8(hb ) + (\u2020) where hb := hb11 * * * hbl l and (\u2020) denotes\na linear combination of terms of strictly smaller degree in the good grading.\nApplying \u03c0\u2212\u03b3 using Lemma 4.2, we deduce that \u03c0\u2212\u03b3 (H b ) = S\u2212\u03b4 (hb ) + (\u2021)\nwhere (\u2021) consists of lower degree terms. Recalling that gr\u2032 U (g0 , e) = U (ge0 )\nby Theorem 3.8, we see by the PBW theorem for U (ge0 ) that the monomials\n\u03c0\u2212\u03b3 (H b ) for all b \u2208 Zl\u22650 do indeed form a basis for U (g0 , e).\n4.2. Verma modules. Recall the embedding \u03b8 : te \u0592\u2192 U (g, e) from Theorem 3.3 and the weight \u03b4 from \u00a74.1. For a U (g, e)-module V and \u03bb \u2208 (te )\u2217 , we\ndefine the \u03bb-weight space\nV\u03bb := {v \u2208 V | (\u03b8 + \u03b4)(t)v = \u03bb(t)v for all t \u2208 te }.\nBy Theorem 3.3(1) we have that U (g, e)\u03b1 V\u03bb \u2286 V\u03bb+\u03b1 . In particular each V\u03bb\nis invariant under the action of the subalgebra U (g, e)0 . We say that V\u03bb is\na maximal weight space of V if U (g, e)\u266f V\u03bb = {0}. For example, if \u03bb is any\nmaximal weight of V in the dominance ordering, i.e. V\u03bb 6= {0} and V\u03bc = {0}\nfor all \u03bc > \u03bb, then V\u03bb is a maximal weight space of V .\nLet V\u03bb be a maximal weight space in a U (g, e)-module V . Then the action of\nU (g, e)0 on V\u03bb factors through the map \u03c0\u2212\u03b3 from Theorem 4.3 to make V\u03bb into\na U (g0 , e)-module such that um = \u03c0\u2212\u03b3 (u)m for u \u2208 U (g, e)0 and m \u2208 V\u03bb . Note\nalso that te is a Lie subalgebra of U (g0 , e) (since te even lies in the center of\nU (p0 )), so we get another action of te on V\u03bb by restricting the U (g0 , e)-action.\nBy Lemma 4.2 this new action satisfies\ntv = \u03bb(t)v\nfor all t \u2208 te . This explains why we included the additional shift by \u03b4 in the\ndefinition of the \u03bb-weight space of a U (g, e)-module.\nWe say that a U (g, e)-module V is a highest weight module if it is generated by\na maximal weight space V\u03bb such that V\u03bb is finite dimensional and irreducible as\na U (g0 , e)-module. In that case, as we will see shortly, \u03bb is the unique maximal\nweight of V in the dominance ordering. Let\n{V\u039b | \u039b \u2208 L}\nbe a complete set of pairwise inequivalent finite dimensional irreducible U (g0 , e)modules for some set L. If V is a highest weight module generated by a maximal\nweight space V\u03bb and V\u03bb \u223c\n= V\u039b for \u039b \u2208 L, we say that V is of type \u039b.\nSince U (g, e)\u266f is invariant under left multiplication by U (g, e) and right multiplication by U (g, e)0 , the quotient U (g, e)/U (g, e)\u266f is a (U (g, e), U (g, e)0 )bimodule. Moreover the right action of U (g, e)0 factors through the map \u03c0\u2212\u03b3\nfrom Theorem 4.3 to make U (g, e)/U (g, e)\u266f into a (U (g, e), U (g0 , e))-bimodule.\n\n\f26\n\nJ. BRUNDAN, S.

Recall the PBW basis for U (g, e) fixed in \u00a74.1.\nLemma 4.4. As a right U (g0 , e)-module, U (g, e)/U (g, e)\u266f is free with basis\n{F a | a \u2208 Zm\n\u22650 }.\nProof. This follows because the cosets of the PBW monomials of the form F a H b\ngive a basis for the quotient U (g, e)/U (g, e)\u266f and the cosets of the monomials\nof the form H b give a basis for U (g, e)0 /U (g, e)0,\u266f \u223c\n= U (g0 , e).\nTheorem 4.5. Given \u039b \u2208 L, let v1 , . . . , vk be a basis for V\u039b and \u03bb be its\nte -weight.\n(1) The vectors {F a \u2297 vi | a \u2208 Zm\n\u22650 , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k} give a basis of M (\u039b, e).\n(2) The weight \u03bb is the unique maximal weight of M (\u039b, e) in the dominance\nordering, M (\u039b, e) is generated by the maximal weight space M (\u039b, e)\u03bb ,\nand M (\u039b, e)\u03bb \u223c\n= V\u039b as U (g0 , e)-modules.\n(3) The module M (\u039b, e) is a universal highest weight module of type \u039b.\n(4) There is a unique maximal proper submodule R(\u039b, e) in M (\u039b, e),\nL(\u039b, e) := M (\u039b, e)/R(\u039b, e)\nis irreducible, and {L(\u039b, e) | \u039b \u2208 L} is a complete set of pairwise inequivalent irreducible highest weight modules over U (g, e).\nProof. (1) This is clear from Lemma 4.4.\nP\n(2) The basis vector F a \u2297 vi is of weight \u03bb \u2212 i ai \u03b3i . Hence the \u03bb-weight\nspace of M (\u039b, e) is 1 \u2297 V\u039b and all other weights of M (\u039b, e) are strictly smaller\nin the dominance ordering.\n(3) By (1)\u2013(2) M (\u039b, e) is a highest weight module of type \u039b. Let V be\nanother highest weight module generated by a maximal weight space V\u03bc and\nf : V\u039b \u2192 V\u03bc be a U (g0 , e)-module isomorphism. By comparing te -actions we\nget that \u03bc = \u03bb. By adjointness of tensor and hom f extends uniquely to a\nU (g, e)-module homomorphism f \u0303 : M (\u039b, e) \u2192 V such that f \u0303(1 \u2297 vi ) = f (vi )\nfor each i. As f \u0303(1 \u2297 V\u039b ) = f (V\u039b ) generates V , we get that f \u0303 is surjective.\n(4) Let N be a submodule of M (\u039b, e). Then N is the direct sum of its te weight spaces. If N\u03bb 6= 0 then N\u03bb generates all of 1 \u2297 V\u039b as a U (g0 , e)-module,\nhence it generates all of M (\u039b, e) as a U (g, e)-module.\nThis shows that if N\nL\nis a proper submodule then it is contained in \u03bc<\u03bb M (\u039b, e)\u03bc . Hence the sum\nof all proper submodules of M (\u039b, e) is still a proper submodule, so M (\u039b, e)\nhas a unique maximal submodule R(\u039b, e) as claimed. By (3) any irreducible\nhighest weight module V of type \u039b is a quotient of M (\u039b, e), hence V \u223c\n= L(\u039b, e).\n\n\fFINITE W -ALGEBRAS\n\n27\n\nMoreover \u03bb is the unique maximal weight of L(\u039b, e) by (2) and L(\u039b, e)\u03bb \u223c\n= V\u039b\nas U (g0 , e)-modules. Hence \u039b is uniquely determined by V .\nCorollary 4.6. Let L+ := {\u039b \u2208 L | dim L(\u039b, e) < \u221e}. Then the modules\n{L(\u039b, e)|\u039b \u2208 L+ } give a complete set of pairwise inequivalent finite dimensional\nirreducible U (g, e)-modules.\nProof. Any finite dimensional irreducible U (g, e)-module L has a maximal\nweight \u03bb. Moreover by irreducibility L is generated by any irreducible U (g0 , e)submodule of L\u03bb . Hence L is an irreducible highest weight module. Now apply\nTheorem 4.5(4).\nUnfortunately we have absolutely no idea how to give an explicit combinatorial parametrization {V\u039b | \u039b \u2208 L} of a complete set of pairwise inequivalent\nfinite dimensional irreducible U (g0 , e)-modules unless the distinguished nilpotent element e of g0 is actually regular. We will discuss the regular case in more\ndetail in \u00a75.1.\n4.3. Central characters. Let Z(g) denote the center of U (g) and Z(g, e) denote the center of U (g, e). It is easy to see that the restriction of the linear map\nPr from \u00a72 defines an injective algebra homomorphism Pr : Z(g) \u0592\u2192 Z(g, e). As\nexplained in the footnote to [P2, Question 5.1], this map is also surjective, so\nit is an algebra isomorphism\n\u223c\n\nPr : Z(g) \u2192 Z(g, e).\nA U (g, e)-module V is of central character \u03c8 : Z(g) \u2192 C if Pr(z)v = \u03c8(z)v for\nall z \u2208 Z(g) and v \u2208 V . Analogously for g0 we have the isomorphism\n\u223c\n\nPr0 : Z(g0 ) \u2192 Z(g0 , e),\nand we say that a U (g0 , e)-module V is of central character \u03c80 : Z(g0 ) \u2192 C\nif Pr0 (z)v = \u03c80 (v) for all z \u2208 Z(g0 ) and v \u2208 V . We want to relate the\ncentral character of an irreducible highest weight module over U (g, e) to the\ncentral character of its maximal weight space over U (g0 , e). We remark that\nthe surjectivity of the map Pr will not be used in any of the arguments below\nbut the surjectivity of Pr0 is essential; if e is regular in g0 then the surjectivity\nof Pr0 is already clear from [K, \u00a72].\nLet \u03a6 (resp. \u03a60 ) denote the root system of g (resp. g0 ) with\n\b respect to t and\nW (resp.

We stress that \u03a6+ is\nnot a positive system of roots in \u03a6; we reserve the notation \u03a6+ for such a thing\nbelow. For each \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6, fix a non-zero vector x\u03b1 in the \u03b1-root space of g and\nlet \u03b1\u2228 := 2\u03b1/(\u03b1|\u03b1) \u2208 t\u2217 .\nNow we define Harish-Chandra isomorphisms\n\u223c\n\n\u03a8 : Z(g) \u2192 S(t)W ,\n\n\u223c\n\n\u03a80 : Z(g0 ) \u2192 S(t)W0\n\n\f28\n\nJ.

Given \u03c3, \u03c4 \u2208 {+, 0, \u2212} let \u03a6\u03c3 (\u03c4 ) denote the set of all \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6\u03c3 such that\nthe degree of x\u03b1 in the good grading is positive, zero or negative according\nto whether \u03c4 = +, 0 or \u2212, respectively. Note that \u03a6\u03c3 (\u03c4 ) = \u2212\u03a6\u2212\u03c3 (\u2212\u03c4 ), in\nparticular, \u03a60 (0) is a closed subsystem of \u03a6 (it is the root system of the reductive\nLie algebra h0 ). Pick a system \u03a6+\n0 (0) of positive roots in \u03a60 (0). Then set\n\u03a6+ := \u03a6+\n0 (0) \u2294 \u03a6+ (0) \u2294 \u03a6+ (\u2212) \u2294 \u03a60 (\u2212) \u2294 \u03a6\u2212 (\u2212),\nwhich is a system of positive roots in \u03a6. Using this choice we define the weights\n\u03c1, \u03c10 and the Harish-Chandra isomorphisms \u03a8, \u03a80 , as explained above. So\n\u0001\nP +\n\u03a60 (0) \u2294 \u03a6+ (0) \u2294 \u03a6+ (\u2212) \u2294 \u03a60 (\u2212) \u2294 \u03a6\u2212 (\u2212) ,\n\u03c1 = 12\n\u0001\nP\n\u03c10 = 21\n\u03a6+ (+) \u2294 \u03a6+ (0) \u2294 \u03a6+ (\u2212) \u2294 \u03a6+\n0 (0) \u2294 \u03a60 (\u2212) .\nRecalling the weight \u03b3 from \u00a74.1, we deduce that\nP\nP\nP\n\u03a6\u2212 (\u2212) = \u03b3.\n\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c10 = 12 \u03a6\u2212 (\u2212) \u2212 21 \u03a6+ (+) =\n\nNow we need to fix some PBW bases. Let t1 , . . . , tn be a basis for t. Also enumerate the elements of \u03a6+\n0 (0) as \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1s , the elements of \u03a60 (\u2212) as \u03b21 , . . . , \u03b2q ,\nthe elements of \u03a6+ (\u2212) \u2294 \u03a6\u2212 (\u2212) as \u03b2q+1 , . . . , \u03b2r , and the elements of \u03a6+ (0) as\n\u03bd1 , . . . , \u03bdp . Order the basis {ti , x\u03b1 | 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6} of g so the x\u2212\u03b2i come\nfirst, then the x\u2212\u03bdi , then the x\u2212\u03b1i , then the ti , then the x\u03b1i , then the x\u03bdi , then\nthe x\u03b2i . This ordering determines a corresponding PBW basis for U (g). Using\n\n\fFINITE W -ALGEBRAS\n\n29\n\nthe same ordering on the basis {ti , x\u03b1 | 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a60 } of g0 we also get a\nPBW basis for U (g0 ).\nWe next calculate Pr0 (z0 ) for any z0 \u2208 Z(g0 ). We can write\nz0 = S\u03c10 (\u03a80 (z0 )) + u0 + v0\nwhere S\u03c10 (\u03a80 (z0 )) \u2208 S(t), u0 is a linear combination of ordered PBW monomials ending in x\u03b1i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 s) and v0 is a linear combination of ordered\nPBW monomials ending in x\u03b2i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 q). As z0 is central it is of degree\n0 in the good grading. Hence S\u03c10 (\u03a80 (z0 )), u0 and v0 are all of degree 0 too.\nNote u0 only involves products of the basis vectors x\u03b11 , . . . , x\u03b1s on the positive\nside, all of which are of degree 0. Hence it can only involve products of the\nbasis vectors x\u2212\u03b11 , . . . , x\u2212\u03b1s on the negative side because each x\u2212\u03b21 , . . . , x\u2212\u03b2q\nis of strictly positive degree. Hence u0 \u2208 U (h0 ) and Pr0 (S\u03c10 (\u03a80 (z0 )) + u0 ) =\nS\u03c10 (\u03a80 (z0 )) + u0 . To compute Pr0 (v0 ), our PBW monomials are ordered so\nthat the basis vectors x\u03b21 , . . . , x\u03b2q for m0 appear on the right hand side, so\nwe simply replace each x\u03b2i by the scalar \u03c7(x\u03b2i ). Since all x\u03b2i are of strictly\nnegative degree, it follows that Pr0 (v0 ) is of strictly positive degree. We have\nshown that\nPr0 (z0 ) = S\u03c10 (\u03a80 (z0 )) + u0 + Pr0 (v0 ) \u2208 Z(g0 , e) \u2286 U (p0 )\nP\nP\nwith S\u03c10 (\u03a80 (z0 )) \u2208 S(t), u0 \u2208 si=1 U (h0 )x\u03b1i and Pr0 (v0 ) \u2208 j>0 U (p0 )(j). In\nparticular we see from this that z0 can be recovered uniquely from Pr0 (z0 ): it\nis the unique element of Z(g0 ) such that\nP\nPs\nS\u03c10 (\u03a80 (z0 )) \u2261 Pr0 (z0 ) (mod\nj>0 U (p0 )(j)).\ni=1 U (h0 )x\u03b1i +\nInstead take an element z \u2208 Z(g). We expand it as\nz = S\u03c1 (\u03a8(z)) + t + u + v\nwhere S\u03c1 (\u03a8(z)) \u2208 S(t), t is a linear combination of ordered PBW monomials\nending in x\u03b1i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 s), u is a linear combination of ordered PBW monomials\nending in x\u03bdi (1 \u2264 i \u2264 p), and v is a linear combination of ordered PBW\nmonomials ending in x\u03b2i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 r). We apply the map Pr and argue just like\nin the previous paragraph to get that\nPr(z) = S\u03c1 (\u03a8(z)) + t + u + Pr(v) \u2208 Z(g, e) \u2286 U (e\np)0\nPp\nPs\nwhere S\u03c1 (\u03a8(z)) \u2208 P\nS(t), t \u2208\ni=1 U (h)x\u03bdi and finally\ni=1 U (h)x\u03b1i , u \u2208\nPr(v) \u2208 U (e\np)kne + j>0 U (p)(j). Next we apply the graded homomorphism\np)0 \u2229 U (e\np)kne .\nS\u2212\u03b3 \u25e6 \u03c0 : U (e\np)0 \u2192 U (p0 ) to this. It annihilates U (h)x\u03bdi and U (e\nSo we deduce recalling Theorem 4.3 that\n\n\u03c0\u2212\u03b3 (Pr(z)) = S\u2212\u03b3 (S\u03c1 ((\u03a8(z))) + w \u2208 Z(g0 , e)\nP\nfor w \u2208 i=1 U (h0 )x\u03b1i + j>0 U (p0 )(j). Using the last sentence of the previous\nparagraph and the fact from [P2] that Pr0 : Z(g0 ) \u0592\u2192 Z(g0 , e) is surjective, we\ndeduce that \u03c0\u2212\u03b3 (Pr(z)) = Pr0 (z0 ) where z0 is the unique element of Z(g0 )\nsuch that S\u03c10 (\u03a80 (z0 )) = S\u2212\u03b3 (S\u03c1 (\u03a8(z))). Equivalently, by the first paragraph,\n\u03a80 (z0 ) = \u03a8(z).\nPs\n\n\f30\n\nJ. BRUNDAN, S. M. GOODWIN AND A. KLESHCHEV\n\nNow we can prove the theorem. Since \u03a8 and \u03a80 are isomorphisms, there\nis obviously a unique map c so the right hand square commutes. For the left\nhand square, we have shown for z \u2208 Z(g) that \u03c0\u2212\u03b3 (Pr(z)) = Pr0 (z0 ) where\n\u03a80 (z0 ) = \u03a8(z). This means that z0 = c(z) hence \u03c0\u2212\u03b3 (Pr(z)) = Pr0 (c(z)).\nFor \u039b \u2208 L, Schur's lemma implies that Z(g0 , e) acts diagonally on \u039b. Let\n: Z(g0 ) \u2192 C be the resulting central character, i.e. Pr0 (z)v = \u03c80\u039b (z)v for\nall z \u2208 Z(g0 ) and v \u2208 \u039b. Let \u03c8 \u039b : Z(g) \u2192 C denote \u03c80\u039b \u25e6 c.\n\n\u03c80\u039b\n\nCorollary 4.8. Let V be a highest weight U (g, e)-module of type \u039b \u2208 L. Then\nV is of central character \u03c8 \u039b : Z(g) \u2192 C.\nProof. Say V is generated by its maximal weight space V\u03bb and f : V\u039b \u2192 V\u03bb\nis an isomorphism of U (g0 , e)-modules. For z \u2208 Z(g) and v \u2208 V\u039b , the theorem\nimplies that\nPr(z)f (v) = f (\u03c0\u2212\u03b3 (Pr(z))v) = f (Pr0 (c(z))v) = \u03c80\u039b (c(z))f (v).\nHence Pr(z) acts on V\u03bb as the scalar \u03c8 \u039b (z). Since V\u03bb generates V as a U (g, e)module it follows that Pr(z) acts on all of V as \u03c8 \u039b (z). Hence V has central\ncharacter \u03c8 \u039b .\nRemark 4.9. Given in addition a weight o \u2208 t\u2217 orthogonal to all the roots in\n\u03a6, one can modify the above definitions of \u03c1 and \u03c10 by adding o \u2208 t\u2217 to them\nboth (\"change of origin\"). Providing one also adds o to the weight \u01eb defined in\n\u00a75.1 below, all our subsequent results remain true as stated. The point is that\nalthough adding o changes the Harish-Chandra isomorphisms \u03a8 and \u03a80 , hence\nalso the parametrization of central characters, it does not affect the maps c or\n\u03b9 in Theorem 4.7.\n4.4. Category O(e). We want to prove that Verma modules have finite length.\nThis is not a hard result if e is regular in g0 , but to prove it in general we need\nto appeal to some recent results of Losev. We first recall a little more of the\nbackground for this.LLet l be a Lagrangian subspace of k (for example a natural\nchoice is l := k+ = \u03b1\u2208\u03a6e k\u03b1 ). Define the left U (g)-module Ql = U (g)/Il and\n+\n\nthe algebra Qlm\u2295l as in Remark 2.1. It is obvious from the definition of Qlm\u2295l\nthat there is a well-defined multiplication map\nQl \u2297 Qlm\u2295l \u2192 Ql,\n\n(u + Il) \u2297 (v + Il) 7\u2192 uv + Il\n\n(U (g), Qlm\u2295l)-bimodule.\n\nmaking Ql into a\nIdentifying Qlm\u2295l with U (g, e) using\nthe isomorphism \u03bd from Remark 2.1 and the isomorphism from Theorem 2.4,\nthis makes Ql into a (U (g), U (g, e))-bimodule too.\nLet C(e) denote the category of all left U (g, e)-modules. Let W(e) denote\nthe category of all g-modules on which x \u2212 \u03c7(x) acts locally nilpotently for all\nx \u2208 m \u2295 l. Note Ql belongs to W(e), hence tensoring with this bimodule defines\na functor\nQl\u2297U (g,e)? : C(e) \u2192 W(e).\nThe important Skryabin's theorem asserts that this functor is an equivalence of\ncategories; see [S] or [GG, Theorem 6.1].\n\n\fFINITE W -ALGEBRAS\n\n31\n\nHence if L is any irreducible U (g, e)-module then Ql \u2297U (g,e) L is an irreducible\nU (g)-module, and its annihilator AnnU (g) (Ql \u2297U (g,e) L) is a primitive ideal of\nU (g). For any primitive ideal P of U (g), we let VA(P ) \u2286 g denote its associated\nvariety; see e.g. [J, \u00a79]. It is known that VA(P ) is the closure of a single\nnilpotent orbit in g; see [J2, 3.10]. By [P2, Theorem 3.1] and [L, Theorem\n1.2.2(ii),(ix)], it is known for any irreducible U (g, e)-module L that\nVA(AnnU (g) (Ql \u2297U (g,e) L)) \u2287 G * e\nwith equality if and only if L is finite dimensional.\nTheorem 4.10. The number of isomorphism classes of irreducible highest\nweight modules for U (g, e) with prescribed central character \u03c8 : Z(g) \u2192 C\nis finite, i.e. the set {\u039b \u2208 L | \u03c8 \u039b = \u03c8} is finite.\nProof. By Corollary 4.8, \u03c8 \u039b = \u03c8 implies \u03c80\u039b = \u03c80 for some central character\n\u03c80 : Z(g0 ) \u2192 C such that \u03c80 \u25e6 c = \u03c8. Each W -orbit in t\u2217 is a union of finitely\nmany W0 -orbits, hence there are finitely many such \u03c80 . Therefore it suffices to\nprove for each \u03c80 : Z(g0 ) \u2192 C that the set {\u039b \u2208 L | \u03c80\u039b = \u03c80 } is finite. In other\nwords, replacing g by g0 , we may assume that e is a distinguished nilpotent\nelement in g and need to prove that the number of isomorphism classes of\nfinite dimensional irreducible U (g, e)-modules with fixed central character \u03c8 is\nfinite. This statement is immediate if e is regular in g by [K, \u00a72]. In general\nwe use [L, Theorem 1.2.2], as follows. The map sending L to AnnU (g,e) (L)\ninduces a bijection between isomorphism classes of finite dimensional irreducible\nU (g, e)-modules of central character \u03c8 and primitive ideals of U (g, e) of finite\ncodimension that contain Pr(ker \u03c8). So we just need to show there are finitely\nmany such primitive ideals. By [L, Theorem 1.2.2(ii),(iii)], if P = AnnU (g,e) (L)\nis a primitive ideal of U (g, e) containing Pr(ker \u03c8) then AnnU (g) (Ql \u2297U (g,e) L) is\na primitive ideal of U (g) containing ker \u03c8. A well known consequence of Duflo's\ntheorem [Du] is that there are only finitely many such primitive ideals in U (g).\nHence there are only finitely many possibilities for P thanks to [L, Theorem\n1.2.2(vi),(vii)].\nCorollary 4.11. For each \u039b \u2208 L, the Verma module M (\u039b, e) has a composition\nseries.\nProof. Imitate the standard argument in the classical case from [D, 7.6.1], using\nCorollary 4.8, Theorem 4.5(1)\u2013(2) and Theorem 4.10.\nNow we introduce an analogue of the Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand category\nO: let O(e) = O(e; t, q) denote the category of all finitely generated U (g, e)modules V that are semisimple over te with finite dimensional te -weight spaces,\nsuch that the set {\u03bb \u2208 (te )\u2217 |V\u03bb 6= {0}} is contained in a finite union of sets of the\nform {\u03bd \u2208 (te )\u2217 | \u03bd \u2264 \u03bc} for \u03bc \u2208 (te )\u2217 . As U (g, e) is Noetherian, O(e) is closed\nunder the operations of taking submodules, quotients and finite direct sums.\nThe following statement follows routinely from Corollary 4.11 and Theorem 4.5.\nCorollary 4.12. Every object in O(e)Lhas a composition series. Moreover the\ncategory O(e) decomposes as O(e) = \u03c8 O\u03c8 (e), where the direct sum is over\n\n\f32\n\nJ. BRUNDAN, S. M. GOODWIN AND A. KLESHCHEV\n\nall central characters \u03c8 : Z(g) \u2192 C, and O\u03c8 (e) denotes the Serre subcategory of\nO(e) generated by the irreducible modules {L(\u039b, e) | \u039b \u2208 L such that \u03c8 \u039b = \u03c8}.\nIn particular, this shows that the irreducible objects in O(e) are all of the\nform L(\u039b, e) for \u039b \u2208 L. In the case e = 0, O(e) is the usual BGG category O\nfor the semisimple Lie algebra g with respect to the maximal toral subalgebra t\nand the Borel q. At the other extreme, if e is a distinguished nilpotent element\nof g, then O(e) is the category of all finite dimensional U (g, e)-modules that\nare semisimple over the Lie algebra center of g.\nRemark 4.13. If e is a distinguished but not a regular nilpotent element\nof g then U (g, e) has primitive ideals of infinite codimension by [L, Theorem\n1.2.2(viii)] and [P2, Theorem 3.1]. So there is no chance in this case that every\nprimitive ideal of U (g, e) is the annihilator of an irreducible highest weight\nmodule in our narrow sense (finite dimensional weight spaces).\n5. Special cases\nIn this section we specialize further. First we discuss the case that e is of\nstandard Levi type in the sense of [FP], i.e. it is a regular nilpotent element of\ng0 . In particular, we will formulate a precise conjecture for the classification\nof finite dimensional irreducible U (g, e)-modules in standard Levi type. Then\nwe prove this conjecture for the standard choice of positive roots in type A, by\ntranslating some results from [BK2] into the present framework. We continue\nwith the notation from the previous section; in particular, recall we fixed a\nparabolic subalgebra q with Levi factor g0 in \u00a74.1.\n5.1. Standard Levi type. Assume from now on that e is a regular nilpotent\nelement of g0 . In that case, by [K, \u00a72], the map Pr0 is an isomorphism\n\u223c\n\nPr0 : Z(g0 ) \u2192 U (g0 , e).\nAs we have already observed in \u00a7\u00a74.3\u20134.4, many things in the theory are simpler\nunder this assumption. To start with, p0 is actually a Borel subalgebra of g0\nwith opposite nilradical n0 . Let \u03a8 and \u03a80 be the Harish-Chandra\nisomorphisms\n\b\nfor g and g0 , defined as in \u00a74.3. Recalling that \u03a6+ = \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6 \u03b1|te \u2208 \u03a6e+ is the\nset of roots corresponding to the nilradical g+ of q, let\nX\nX\n\u03b1 + 21\n\u03b2i .\n\u01eb := 21\n1\u2264i\u2264r\n\u03b2i |t e =0\n\n\u03b1\u2208\u03a6+\n\nThis is just the weight \u03c10 from \u00a74.3 for the system of positive roots in \u03a60\ncorresponding to the Borel subalgebra t \u2295 n0 of g0 (though we don't necessarily\nwant to fix this choice). With this in mind, the following lemma is essentially\n[K, Proposition 2.3]:\nLemma 5.1. Let \u03be : U (p0 ) \u0589 S(t) be the homomorphism induced by the natural\nprojection p0 \u0589 t. Then the restriction of S\u2212\u01eb \u25e6\u03be defines an algebra isomorphism\n\u223c\n\n\u03be\u2212\u01eb : U (g0 , e) \u2192 S(t)W0\nsuch that \u03a80 = \u03be\u2212\u01eb \u25e6 Pr0 .\n\n\fFINITE W -ALGEBRAS\n\n33\n\nWe can now define an explicit set L parametrizing the Verma modules\nM (\u039b, e) and the irreducible highest weight modules L(\u039b, e) for U (g, e): define\nL := t\u2217 /W0 = Spec(S(t)W0 ).\nThus each \u039b \u2208 L is a W0 -orbit of weights in t\u2217 . For each \u039b \u2208 L, let V\u039b\ndenote the one dimensional irreducible U (g0 , e)-module obtained by lifting the\nirreducible S(t)W0 -module corresponding to \u039b through the isomorphism \u03be\u2212\u01eb :\n\u223c\nU (g0 , e) \u2192 S(t)W0 from Lemma 5.1. Also fix finally a Borel subalgebra b0 of\ng0 containing t and let\nb := b0 \u2295 g+ ,\nwhich is a Borel subalgebra of g contained in the parabolic q. Let \u03a6+\n0 and\n+\n+\nsystems of positive roots in \u03a60 and \u03a6 corresponding to\n\u03a6 = \u03a60 \u2294 \u03a6+ be theP\nb0 and b. Let \u03c1 := 21 \u03b1\u2208\u03a6+ \u03b1. For \u03bb \u2208 t\u2217 , let C\u03bb\u2212\u03c1 be the one dimensional\nt-module of weight \u03bb \u2212 \u03c1. Let\nM (\u03bb) := U (g) \u2297U (b) C\u03bb\u2212\u03c1\ndenote the usual Verma module for g of highest weight (\u03bb \u2212 \u03c1), with unique\nirreducible quotient L(\u03bb). Note by Corollary 4.8 and Lemma 5.1 that the central\ncharacter \u03c8 \u039b of L(\u039b, e) is equal to the central character of L(\u03bb) for any \u03bb \u2208 \u039b.\nAll other notation used below is as explained in \u00a74.4.\nConjecture 5.2. For \u039b \u2208 L, pick \u03bb \u2208 \u039b such that (\u03bb|\u03b1\u2228 ) \u2208\n/ Z>0 for each\n\u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6+\n.\nThen\nL(\u039b,\ne)\nis\nfinite\ndimensional\nif\nand\nonly\nif\n0\nVA(AnnU (g) (L(\u03bb))) = G * e.\nWe will verify this conjecture in type A (for the standard choice of positive\nroots) in Corollary 5.6 below. To formulate a stronger conjecture which was\ninspired by ideas of Premet, let\nu := n0 \u2295 g+ ,\nwhich is a maximal nilpotent subalgebra of g contained in q. Note that \u03c7\nrestricts to a character of u. Let O(\u03c7) = O(\u03c7; t, q) denote the category of all\nfinitely generated g-modules M that are locally finite over Z(g) and semisimple\nover te , such that x\u2212\u03c7(x) acts locally nilpotently on M for all x \u2208 u. This is the\ncategory N (\u03c7) from [MS] (with n there equal to our u) except we have added\nthe mild extra condition that the center of the Levi factor of q containing t acts\nsemisimply. In the case \u03c7 = 0 we note that O(\u03c7) is the usual BGG category\nO again. To define the basic objects in the category O(\u03c7), let R denote the\nquotient of U (g) by the left ideal generated by all {x \u2212 \u03c7(x) | x \u2208 u}. This left\nideal is invariant under right multiplication by elements of U (g0 , e), hence R is\na (U (g), U (g0 , e))-bimodule. For \u039b \u2208 L, set\nM (\u039b, \u03c7) := R \u2297U (g0 ,e) V\u039b ,\nnaturally an object of O(\u03c7) of central character \u03c8 \u039b . In [MS, \u00a72], it is shown\nthat M (\u039b, \u03c7) has a unique irreducible quotient L(\u039b, \u03c7), and that every object\nin O(\u03c7) has a composition series involving only the L(\u039b, \u03c7) as composition\nfactors.\n\n\f34\n\nJ. BRUNDAN, S. M. GOODWIN AND A. KLESHCHEV\n\nConjecture 5.3. There is an equivalence of categories W : O(\u03c7) \u2192 O(e) such\nthat WM (\u039b, \u03c7) \u223c\n= M (\u039b, e) and WL(\u039b, \u03c7) \u223c\n= L(\u039b, e) for each \u039b \u2208 L. Moreover,\nW should respect annihilators in the sense that\nAnnU (g) (M ) = AnnU (g) (Ql \u2297U (g,e) WM )\nfor each M \u2208 O(\u03c7).\nWe point out that Conjecture 5.2 follows from Conjecture 5.3. Indeed, using\n[MS, Theorem 5.1], one can check for \u03bb \u2208 \u039b as in Conjecture 5.2 that\nAnnU (g) (L(\u039b, \u03c7)) = AnnU (g) (L(\u03bb)).\nBy Conjecture 5.3 we get that AnnU (g) (Ql \u2297U (g,e) L(\u039b, e)) = AnnU (g) (L(\u03bb)),\nand then Conjecture 5.2 follows using [P2, Theorem 3.1] and [L, Theorem\n1.2.2(ii),(ix)] (see the discussion just before Theorem 4.10). Combined with [Ba,\nTheorem 6.2] and the Kazhdan\u2013Lusztig conjecture for g, Conjecture 5.3 would\nalso mean that the composition multiplicities of all Verma modules M (\u039b, e)\ncan be computed in terms of Kazhdan\u2013Lusztig polynomials. In particular, the\nKazhdan\u2013Lusztig conjecture of [VD] (as we understand it) is a consequence, as\nis [BK2, Conjecture 7.17] in type A. Note finally that Conjecture 5.3 (hence\nalso Conjecture 5.2) is true if e \u2208 g is a long root element. In this special case\nfor the good grading arising from the ad h-eigenspace decomposition of g, the\nequivalence of categories W is given simply by taking Whittaker vectors with\nrespect to m \u2295 k+ ; see [P2, Theorem 7.1].\n5.2. Type A. We now recast some of the results of [BK2] in the language of\nthis paper. In particular we prove Conjecture 5.2 for the standard choice of\npositive roots in type A. So let g := glN (C) equipped with the trace form (.|.),\nt be the set of diagonal matrices and b be the set of upper triangular matrices.\nLet \u03b5i \u2208 t\u2217 be the ith diagonal coordinate function. Then the root system is\n\u03a6 = \u03a6+ \u2294 (\u2212\u03a6+ ) where \u03a6+ := {\u03b5i \u2212 \u03b5j | 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 N } as usual.\nLet p be a partition of N and draw its Young diagram like in the following\nexample:\np1 1 2\np2 3 4 5\np3 6 7 8 9\nq1 q2 q3 q4\nWe let n denote the number of rows and l denote the number of columns in the\nYoung diagram of p. We index the rows of the diagram by 1, . . . , n from top\nto bottom, columns by 1, . . . , l from left to right, and boxes by 1, . . . , N along\nrows as in the example. Let pi (resp. qi ) denote the number of boxes in the\nith row (resp. ith column). Let row(i) and col(i) denote the row and column\nnumbers of the ith box. Letting ei,j denote the ij-matrix unit, we let e \u2208 g2 be\nthe nilpotent matrix\nX\nei,j ,\ne=\n1\u2264i,j\u2264N\nrow(i)=row(j)\ncol(i)=col(j)\u22121\n\n\fFINITE W -ALGEBRAS\n\n35\n\nwhich clearly has Jordan type p; e.g. e = e1,2 + e3,4 + e4,5 + e6,7 + e7,8 + e8,9\nin the above example. We define an even good grading for e by declaring that\nei,j is of degree 2(col(j) \u2212 col(i)). We call this the standard good grading. Now\ndefine the finite W -algebra U (g, e) as in \u00a72.2. As the good grading is even,\nU (g, e) is simply a subalgebra of U (p). The Levi factor h of p satisfies\n\u223c gl (C) \u2295 * * * \u2295 gl (C).\nh=\nq1\n\nql\n\nWe also fix the choice of the parabolic q in \u00a74.1 to be the span of the matrix\nunits {ei,j | row(i) \u2264 row(j)}. So the Levi factor g0 of q satisfies\n\u223c gl (C) \u2295 * * * \u2295 gl (C).\ng0 =\np1\npl\nThe choice of q determines a system of positive roots \u03a6e+ in the restricted root\nsystem \u03a6e , which we call the standard positive roots.\nWe incorporate the following two shifts as indicated in Remarks 3.4 and 4.9:\n\u03b7 :=\n\nN\nX\n\n(n \u2212 qcol(i) \u2212 qcol(i)+1 \u2212 * * * \u2212 ql )\u03b5i ,\n\no := \u2212 21 (N \u2212 1)\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03b5i .\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nNoting \u03b7 does indeed extend to a character of p, the embedding \u03b8 from Theorem 3.3 shifted in this way is the restriction of S\u03b7 : U (p) \u2192 U (p), which matches\n[BK1, (9.2)]. Also the choice of origin o means that the weight \u03c1 from \u00a74.3 is\n\u03c1 = \u2212\u03b52 \u2212 2\u03b53 \u2212 * * * \u2212 (N \u2212 1)\u03b5N ,\nwhich agrees with the choice made in [BK2]. In [BK1] an explicit linear map\n\u0398 : ge \u0592\u2192 U (g, e) as in Theorem 3.6 was described. The images of a certain\ndistinguished basis of ge under this explicit map \u0398 were denoted\n(r)\n\n{Di\n\n\u2208 U (g, e) | 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 r \u2264 pi },\n\n(r)\n\n{Ei,j \u2208 U (g, e) | 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n, pj \u2212 pi < r \u2264 pj },\n(r)\n\n{Fi,j \u2208 U (g, e) | 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n, 0 < r \u2264 pi }.\nThese elements belong to the zero, positive and negative restricted root spaces\nof U (g, e), respectively. Recall the maps \u03be\u2212\u01eb from Lemma 5.1 and \u03c0\u2212\u03b3 from\nTheorem 4.3.\n(r)\n\nLemma 5.4. \u03be\u2212\u01eb (\u03c0\u2212\u03b3 (Di )) is equal to the rth elementary symmetric function\nin {ej,j + i \u2212 1 | 1 \u2264 j \u2264 N, row(j) = i}.\n(r)\n\nProof. We need to recall the explicit form of the element Di from [BK1,\nCorollary 9.4]:\nr\nX\nX\n(r)\n(\u22121)r\u2212s+#{1<k\u2264s | row(ik )<i} S\u03b7 (ei1 ,j1 * * * eis ,js )\nDi =\ns=1 i1 ,...,is\nj1 ,...,js\n\nwhere the second sum is over all 1 \u2264 i1 , . . . , is , j1 , . . . , js \u2264 N such that\n(1) col(j1 ) \u2212 col(i1 ) + * * * + col(js ) \u2212 col(is ) = r \u2212 s;\n(2) col(it ) \u2264 col(jt ) for each t = 1, . . . , s;\n(3) if row(jt ) \u2265 i then col(jt ) < col(it+1 ) for each t = 1, . . . , s \u2212 1;\n\n\f36\n\nJ. BRUNDAN, S. M. GOODWIN AND A. KLESHCHEV\n\n(4) if row(jt ) < i then col(jt ) \u2265 col(it+1 ) for each t = 1, . . . , s \u2212 1;\n(5) row(i1 ) = row(js ) = i;\n(6) row(jt ) = row(it+1 ) for each t = 1, . . . , s \u2212 1.\nWe claim that the map \u03c0 : U (p)0 \u2192 U (p0 ) annihilates all S\u03b7 (ei1 ,j1 * * * eis ,js ) on\nthe right hand side of this formula that have row(it ) 6= i for some t. To see\nthis, take such a monomial and the maximal such t. If row(it ) < i then eit ,jt\ncan be commuted to the end of the monomial in view of (3), hence since it lies\nin a positive restricted root space it is mapped to zero by \u03c0. If row(it ) > i then\nwe let 1 \u2264 u < t be maximal such that row(iu ) < row(ju ). Again eiu ,ju can be\ncommuted to the end of the monomial by (3) and \u03c0 gives zero.\n(r)\nUsing the claim and (6) we see that \u03c0(Di ) is given explicitly by the analogous expression summing over 1 \u2264 i1 , . . . , is , j1 , . . . , js \u2264 N satisfying the same\nconditions as before and also row(it ) = row(jt ) = i for all t. Applying S\u2212\u03b3 then\nS\u2212\u01eb \u25e6 \u03be and using Lemma 4.2 (recalling that \u03b8 is the restriction of S\u03b7 ) we see\n(r)\nthat \u03be\u2212\u01eb (\u03c0\u2212\u03b3 (Di )) is equal to the rth elementary symmetric function in\n{S\u2212\u01eb\u2212\u03b4 (ej,j ) | 1 \u2264 j \u2264 N, row(j) = i}.\nIt remains to show S\u2212\u01eb\u2212\u03b4 (ej,j ) = ej,j +i\u22121. To see this, let N(j), NE(j), E(j), . . .\ndenote the number of boxes to the north (strictly above and in the same column), north east (strictly above and strictly to the right), east (strictly to the\nright and in the same row), . . . of the jth box. The weights \u03b4 from \u00a74.1 and \u01eb\nfrom \u00a75.1 are then given explicitly by the formulae\n\u03b4=\n\nN\nX\n(NW(j) + N(j) + NE(j) + E(j) + S(j) + 1 \u2212 n)\u03b5j ,\nj=1\n\n\u01eb=\u2212\n\nN\nX\n\n(NW(j) + N(j) + NE(j) + E(j))\u03b5j ,\n\nj=1\n\nrecalling we have shifted by \u2212\u03b7 and o as indicated in Remarks 3.4 and 4.9.\nHence\nN\nN\nX\nX\n(1 \u2212 row(j))\u03b5j\n(S(j) + 1 \u2212 n)\u03b5j =\n\u01eb+\u03b4 =\nj=1\n\nj=1\n\nas required to complete the proof.\nA p-tableau means a filling of boxes of the Young diagram\nof p with complex\nP\nnumbers. The map sending a tableau to the weight N\na\n\u03b5\ni=1 i i , where ai is the\nentry in the ith box, defines a bijection from the set Tab(p) of all p-tableaux\nto the set t\u2217 . It induces a bijection from the set Row(p) of all row equivalence\nclasses of p-tableaux to the set L = t\u2217 /W0 from \u00a75.1. Let \u2264 denote the partial\norder on C defined by a \u2264 b if b \u2212 a \u2208 Z\u22650 . We call a tableau column strict if\nits entries are strictly increasing up columns from bottom to top in this order.\nTheorem 5.5. Let \u039b \u2208 L and A \u2208 Row(p) be the corresponding row equivalence class of p-tableaux. Then L(\u039b, e) is finite dimensional if and only if A\nhas a column strict representative.\n\n\fFINITE W -ALGEBRAS\n\n37\n\nProof. In [BK2, \u00a76.1] a U (g, e)-module M is called a highest weight module of\n(r)\ntype A if it is generated by a vector v+ that is annihilated by all the Ei,j and\n(r)\n\nsuch that Di acts on v+ by multiplication by the rth elementary symmetric\nfunction in the elements {aj + i \u2212 1 | 1 \u2264 j \u2264 N, row(j) = i}, where aj is the\nentry in the jth box of some representative of A. In view of Lemma 5.4 and\nthe explicit definition of V\u039b given just after Lemma 5.1, this is exactly the same\nas the notion of a highest weight module of type \u039b \u2208 L from \u00a74.2. Hence the\nVerma modules M (\u039b, e) and their irreducible quotients L(\u039b, e) here are exactly\nthe same as the modules M (A) and L(A) in [BK2, \u00a76.1]. Given this, the present\ntheorem is a restatement of [BK2, Theorem 7.9].\nCorollary 5.6. Conjecture 5.2 holds in the present situation.\nProof. To deduce this from Theorem 5.5, we need to recall some classical results describing the associated varieties of primitive ideals in U (g) in terms\nP\n\u2217\nthe Robinson-Schensted correspondence. Let \u03bb = N\ni=1 ai \u03b5i \u2208 t . We define a\ntableau A(\u03bb) by starting from the empty tableau and then using the RobinsonSchensted row insertion algorithm to successively incorporate the complex numbers a1 , . . . , aN . At the ith step we add ai to the bottom row of the tableau\nunless there is an entry b already in the bottom row with ai < b, in which case\nwe pick the smallest such b, replace b by ai then bump b into the next row\nup by the analogous procedure. See [F, \u00a71.1] for a detailed account. By [J1,\nCorollary 3.3] (together with [J1, Lemma 2.4] to reduce to regular weights) it\nis known that VA(AnnU (g) (L(\u03bb))) is equal to the closure of the orbit consisting\nof all nilpotent matrices of Jordan type equal to the shape of the tableau A(\u03bb).\nNow to prove the corollary we take \u039b \u2208 L and pick a representative \u03bb \u2208 \u039b\nsuch that (\u03bb|\u03b1\u2228 ) \u2208\n/ Z>0 for all \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6+\n0 . Let A be the corresponding p-tableau.\nThus if a < b are entries in the same row of A then a is located to the left of b.\nIt is now an elementary combinatorial exercise to check that A is row equivalent\nto a column strict tableau if and only if A(\u03bb) is of shape p. Combined with\nTheorem 5.5 and the preceding paragraph, we deduce that L(\u039b, e) is finite\ndimensional if and only if VA(AnnU (g) (L(\u03bb))) = G * e.\nThe result just proved also holds for an arbitrary good grading; the general\ncase easily reduces to the standard good grading considered here using [BG,\nTheorem 2].\nReferences\n[A]\n[Ba]\n[BGG]\n[BT]\n[B1]\n\nT.
