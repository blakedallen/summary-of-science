Condensed matter analogues have been\nmainly proposed, because of their conceptual simplicity and experimental feasibility in the laboratory. They appear\nparticularly useful in order to simulate kinematical properties of curved space-time. Such a research area is appealing\nalso because sometimes insights gained within the GR context could help to understand aspects of the analogue model.\nFollowing this line of thought different condensed matter systems have been introduced as analogue models. In\nsuch a context acoustics in flowing fluids, light in moving dielectrics or quasiparticles in moving superfluids, have\nbeen shown to reproduce some aspects of GR and cosmology3,4 . They can be conceived as laboratory toy models in\norder to make experimentally accessible some features of quantum field theory on curved space-time. The analogy\nbetween the motion of sound waves in a convergent fluid flow and massless spin-zero particles exposed to a black\nhole was first outlined in the seminal paper by Unruh2 . Since then, the search for an emergent space-time has been\nextended to various media, such as electromagnetic waveguides5, superfluid helium3 and Bose-Einstein condensates\n(BEC)6 . Emergent space-time and gravity effects in superfluids are of particular interest. Indeed the extremely low\ntemperatures experimentally accessible allow in principle the detection of tiny quantum effects, such as Hawking\nradiation, particle production and quantum back-reaction7,8 . In particular, liquid helium II offers the possibility of\nan experimental control of the value of the speed of first sound, which corresponds to thermal phonons. That may\nbe achieved, for example, by fixing temperature and varying pressure within a wide range (up to about 2.5 MPa)\nbelow the lambda transition point9 . On the other hand, Bose-Einstein condensates made of cold atoms in optical\nlattices are very promising because of the high degree of experimental control10 . Indeed such systems have been\nproposed to mimic an expanding Freedman, Robertson, Walker (FRW) universe11 , where the behavior of quantum\nmodes has been reproduced by manipulating the speed of sound through external fields via Feshbach resonance\ntechniques12 . The key point of such a finding is the relation c2s \u221d as between the propagation speed cs and the s-wave\nscattering length as of the atoms of the condensate6 . In this way the value of cs can be changed at will by varying the\nscattering length in a sufficiently slow manner by means of suitable external fields. That happens without violating\nthe basic assumptions made in deriving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation10 , which describes BEC, and makes some of\nthe predictions of semiclassical quantum gravity and cosmology testable in the laboratory12.\nIn a recent paper1 a new analogy between superfluids and cosmology has been presented, which relies on the\ndepletion of the mass density \u03c1 in the superfluid due to thermal phonons. That is the back-reaction of the vacuum to\nthe quanta of sound waves. Under these new conditions, the free energy is written as the sum of two contributions:\nthe energy of the quantum vacuum and the free energy of the \"matter\", the phonons. Then, it is possible to show7\nthat\n1\nF (T, \u03c1) = Fvac + Fmat = Fvac \u2212 Pmat = \u03b5(\u03c1) \u2212 \u03bc\u03c1 \u2212 \u03b5mat (\u03c1),\n3\n\n(I.1)\n\nwhere \u03b5 \u2212 \u03bc\u03c1 = \u03b5vac and \u03b5mat are, in this order, the energy density of the quantum vacuum and the energy density\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\ne-mail: naddeo@sa.infn.it\ne-mail: Giovanni.Scelza@unige.ch\n\n\f2\nof the gas of thermal phonons (radiation energy). By expanding the free energy F in terms of \u03b4\u03c1 = \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c10 and\n\u03b4\u03bc = \u03bc \u2212 \u03bc0 (where \u03c10 and \u03bc0 are the equilibrium density and the chemical potential at T = 0, \u03c1 = \u03c1(T 6= 0) and\n\u03bc = \u03bc(T 6= 0)) and then by minimizing over \u03b4\u03c1 the following hydrodynamical equation7 is obtained\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03b5mat 1\n\u03c1 \u2202cs\n\u03b4\u03c1\n.\n(I.2)\n=\u2212 2\n+\n\u03c1\n\u03c1cs 3 cs \u2202\u03c1\n\u03b4\u03c1\nIt is possible to show1 that, under the hypothesis \u03b5mat\n<< 1, Eq. (I.2) can be cast in a form which looks very similar\nto the cosmological fluid one (see Eq. (I.4) for a comparison):\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd\u03c1\n3\n2 \u03c1 \u03b4\u03c1\n\u03c1 \u2212 3cs\n,\n(I.3)\n\u2243\u2212\ndcs\ncs\n\u03b5mat\n\ncs being the phonon speed. Indeed in the cosmological context, the Friedman fluid equation11\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd\u03c1\np\n3\n\u03c1+ 2 ,\n=\u2212\nda\na\nc\n\n(I.4)\n\nwhere a = a(t) is the scale parameter of the Universe, is obtained starting from the Einstein equations by means of\nthe condition\nD\u03bd T0 \u03bd = D\u03bd T 0\u03bd = 0,\n\n(I.5)\n\nwhere D\u03bd is the covariant derivative.\nLet us notice that the correspondence between the above equations (I.3) and (I.4) is\ncs ! a.\n\n(I.6)\n\nWe point out that the result (I.2), from which we deduce (I.3), can be obtained through the analysis of a classical\nhydrodynamic equation made by Stone13 for which the Unruh metric2 holds. Furthermore the conclusion (I.6) is a\ncrucial one in that leads us to derive in an alternative way the effective metric for the superfluid.\nSuch a derivation is the aim of this letter. Indeed by exploiting the mathematical analogy between the propagation\nof sound in a nonhomogeneous potential flow and the propagation of a scalar field in a curved space-time, in full\nanalogy with Ref.13 , we will show that it is possible to introduce an action S and an energy-momentum tensor\nT\u03bc\u03bd = \u221a2\u2212g \u03b4g\u03b4S\u03bc\u03bd in such a way that the conservation law D\u03bd T \u03bc\u03bd = 0 is satisfied, D\u03bd being the usual GR covariant\nderivative.\nIn Section 2, following these steps, Eq. (I.3) will be recovered and the formal analogy between GR and fluid\ndynamics introduced in Ref.1 will be fully exploited. Finally, in Section 3 we summarize our conclusions and outline\nsome perspectives and open problems.\nII.\n\nTHE FOUR-DIMENSIONAL ANALOGY\n\nIn this Section we fully exploit the analogy between the propagation of sound in a nonhomogeneous potential flow\nand that of a scalar field in a curved space-time by carrying out an analysis similar to the one developed by Stone13\nor Fedichev and Fischer14 . There it is shown how it is possible to describe a perfect, irrotational fluid, within a\nfour-dimensional formalism, through the equation \u0003\u03a6 = 0, where \u03a6 is a scalar field, by means of the Unruh metric.\nLet us start by finding an effective metric for\nof our reasoning is as follows.\nBy\no\ni\nn the\nh superfluid. The key point\n\u2212\n\u03c1(t,\u2192\nx)\n2\n2\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n2\n2\n2\n2\n,\nwhere\ndt\n\u2212\n2\nv\n(t,\nx\n)\n*\ndtd\nx\n+\nd\nx\n\u2212 (cs (t, x )) \u2212 ( v (t, x ))\nlooking at the Unruh metric : dsUN = c t,\u2192\n\u2212\ns( x )\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\nv (t, x ) is the physical velocity of the superfluid with respect to the laboratory, it is possible to deduce a minkowskian\n\u2192\n\u2192\nacoustic metric in the case \u2212\nv (t, \u2212\nx ) = 0, i.e. the case of an inner observer. By means of a conformal transformation 15 ,\nsuch a metric can be written as\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\u22122\n1 \uf8ec0 \u2212cs (t)\n0\n0 \uf8f7\n(II.7)\n[g\u03bc\u03bd ] =\n\uf8f8.\n\uf8ed\n0\n\u2212c\u22122\n(t)\n0\n\u03c1(t) 0\ns\n\u22122\n0\n0\n0\n\u2212cs (t)\nLet us notice that the density \u03c1 is a function of the time alone in order to describe an homogeneous fluid.\nNow, within the GR context the cosmological fluid equation (I.4) is derived starting from the Einstein equations which\ndo not hold for a quantum fluid. Then, in order to satisfy the condition (I.5) also for the analogue superfluid system\n\n\f3\nunder study we need to proceed in a different way.\nOur strategy is the following. Let us suppose that the hydrodynamical equation (I.3) is derived by a wave equation\nof the kind\n\u221a\n1\n\u0003\u03a6 = \u221a \u2202\u03bc ( \u2212gg \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bd \u03a6) = 0,\n(II.8)\n\u2212g\nwhere \u03a6 = \u03a6(t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) is some massless scalar field and g\u03bc\u03bd is the metric tensor (II.7), with g = Det(g\u03bc\u03bd ).\nWe explicitly note that for a pure radiation field, that is the case considered in (II.8), it is cp2 = \u03c13 , then Eq. (I.4) can\n\u03b4\u03c1\nd\u03c1\n= \u2212 a4 \u03c1. Remembering our hypothesis about \u03b5mat\n, we can rewrite (I.3) as ddc\u03c1s \u2243 \u2212 c3s \u03c1 and, then, the\nbe written as da\nformal similitude between Eqs. (I.3) and (I.4) is preserved.\nThe result is:\n\u0012\n\u0013!\nd\u03c1\ncs \u2202t,t \u03a6\n\u03c1\nc3s\n\u0003\u03a6 = 0 \u21d2\n\u2202\u03c6,\u03c6 \u03a6 + \u2202\u03b8,\u03b8 \u03a6 + \u2202r,r \u03a6\n= 0.\n(II.9)\n3\u2212\n=\u2212\n+\ndcs\ncs\nc \u0307s \u2202t \u03a6\nc \u0307s \u2202t \u03a6\nHere, c \u0307s is the time derivative of the sound velocity, and \u2202x and \u2202x,x are the first and second order partial derivatives\nwith respect to the variable x. Now, by making a simple comparison among Eqs. (II.9) and (I.3), we can also find\n(with arbitrary parameters) the suitable expression for the field \u03a6(t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6).\nIn order to analytically solve such an equation, we make the following simplifying assumptions:\n\u2022 \u03a6 is a function of the time alone: \u03a6 = \u03a6(t);\n1\n\n\u2022 the sound velocity is equal to cs (t) = \u03b3t 2 , so that cs \u010bs =\n\u2022 the quantity \u03b6 =\n\n\u03b4\u03c1\n\u03b5mat\n\n\u03b32\n2 ,\n\n\u03b3 being a constant21 ;\n\nis assumed to be a constant.\n\nIn this way, by means of a direct comparison with Equation (I.3), Equation (II.9) can be easily solved and a simple\nsolution for the field \u03a6 is given by\n\u03a6(t) =\n\n\u221a ek t\n,\n2\nk\n\n(II.10)\n\nwhere k = 29 \u03b3 2 \u03b6. Such a field can be identified with the sound field, which is expected to correspond to a quantum\ncoherent state of phonons13 .\nThe next step to carry out in order to fully exploit the similarity with GR is to find an an action S from which to\ndeduce an energy-momentum tensor that could allow us to achieve Eq. (I.3). Proceeding in analogy with Reference13 ,\nlet us introduce an action S defined as:\nZ\nZ\n\u221a\n4 1\u221a\n\u03bc\u03bd\nS= d x\n\u2212gg \u2202\u03bc \u03a6\u2202\u03bd \u03a6 = d4 x \u2212gL,\n(II.11)\n2\nwhere the sound field \u03a6 is defined through Eq. (II.8). Let us remember explicitly that such an action gives rise\nto Eq. (II.8) by setting equal to zero the variation of the action with respect to \u03a6, i.e. \u03b4\u03a6 S = 0 (see for instance\nRef.16 ). It is well known11,17 that any action S automatically provides us with a covariantly conserved and symmetric\nenergy-momentum tensor\n2 \u03b4g S\nT\u03bc\u03bd = \u221a\n,\n\u2212g \u03b4g \u03bc\u03bd\n\n(II.12)\n\nwhere now \u03b4g S is the variation of the action with respect to the metric. In this way we find\n1\nT \u03bc\u03bd = \u2202 \u03bc \u03a6\u2202 \u03bd \u03a6 \u2212 g \u03bc\u03bd (g \u03b1\u03b2 \u2202\u03b1 \u03a6\u2202\u03b2 \u03a6),\n2\nthat, in the case under study, takes the form:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u03c1(t)2\n0\n0\n0\n2\n2\n0\n0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0 cs (t) \u03c1(t)\n[T \u03bc\u03bd ] = e2k t \uf8ed\n\uf8f8,\n0\n0\ncs (t)2 \u03c1(t)2\n0\n2\n2\n0\n0\n0\ncs (t) \u03c1(t)\n\n(II.13)\n\nwhere the result of Eq. (II.10) has been introduced.\nThe condition \u03b4g S = 0, gives rise to the following crucial one17 :\nD\u03bd T \u03bc\u03bd = T \u03bc\u03bd;\u03bd =\n\n\u2202T \u03bc\u03bd\n+ \u0393\u03bc\u03bd\u03c3 T \u03c3\u03bd + \u0393\u03bd\u03bd\u03c3 T \u03bc\u03c3 = 0,\n\u2202x\u03bd\n\n(II.14)\n\n\f4\nwhere it appears clearly that D\u03bc is the usual GR definition of the covariant derivative. In particular, from the equation\nT 0\u03bd;\u03bd = 0\n\n(II.15)\n\nwe re-obtain the hydrodynamical equation (I.3). That is a statement of the correctness of our hypotheses and a proof\nof the formal analogy between GR and superfluid dynamics introduced in Ref.1 .\nFurthermore let us notice that, starting from:\n\uf8f6\n\u03c1(t)\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0 \u2212\u03c1(t)\n,\n[T \u03bc\u03bd ] = e2k t \uf8ed\n0\n0\n\u2212\u03c1(t)\n0 \uf8f8\n0\n0\n0\n\u2212\u03c1(t)\n\uf8eb\n\n(II.16)\n\nthe energy density and the pressure of the massless scalar field \u03a6 are derived and take the form (we follow the definition\nof Kolb and Turner18 ):\n\u03c1\u03a6 = T 00 = e2k t \u03c1(t)\nand\np\u03a6 =\n\n1 i\nT = \u2212e2k t \u03c1(t).\n3 i\n\nThen, finally, we automatically get the relation\n\u03c1\u03a6 = \u2212p\u03a6 ,\n\n(II.17)\n\nwhich coincides with the equation of state for the inflaton field in an inflationary universe19 . We plan to further investigate this topic and to clarify how inflationary dynamics can be mimicked in the laboratory in a future publication20 .\nIII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES\n\nIn conclusion, by means of the field equation (II.9) we have rewritten the hydrodynamical equation (I.3) within\na four-dimensional framework. That allowed us to make a direct comparison among superfluid dynamics and GR.\nFollowing Stone13 we were able to introduce an action S and an energy-momentum tensor T \u03bc\u03bd for the sound field \u03a6.\nThat allowed us to derive the relevant hydrodynamical equation (I.3) from the condition D\u03bd T \u03bc\u03bd = 0 even if superfluid\ndynamics theory lacks general covariance. In this way the analogy between GR and superfluid theory can be made\nvery transparent. We stress that within the new conditions considered here, i. e. the back-reaction of the vacuum to\nthe quanta of sound waves, we are faced with a sound speed cs depending on the time. In order to make Equation\n1\n\u0003\u03a6 = 0 equivalent to Equation (I.3), the relation cs \u221d t 2 has been found.\nThe relevance of finding similarities among different fields of research and of building up analogue models in order\nto test theories which otherwise could not be proven. In the particular case we study in this letter, the paradigm of\ncosmology as a research area where it is not possible to check hypotheses is bypassed since we have a toy model, a\nsuperfluid system built in the laboratory, where our predictions could be tested. Then, all the formal similarities we\nfind could give us new insights to understand the nature of the universe. For instance, in the context of superfluid\nsystems the presence of thermal phonons plays the same role as the matter in the universe. At this stage a question\nseems to emerge as a speculation: within the cosmological area, can we conceive the matter as a thermal perturbation\nof the vacuum as for the superfluids?\n\nIV.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe wish to thank Dr. F.
