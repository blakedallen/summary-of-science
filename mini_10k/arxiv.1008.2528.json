This characteristic was somehow lacking in electrical circuit\ntheory, since resistors, capacitors and inductors are defined by voltage-current, charge-voltage\nand flux-current relations, respectively. The design of such a memory-resistor or memristor\nat the nanometer scale announced by an HP team in 2008 [37] has driven a lot of attention\nto these devices. Many applications are being developed (cf. [9, 21, 36, 38, 40] and references\ntherein). Memristive devices pose challenging problems at the device and circuit modeling\nlevels [4, 28, 33, 39] but also from a dynamical perspective [20, 25, 26, 27, 31].\nThe memristor reported in [37] is governed by a relation of the form\nv = M(q)i,\n\n(1)\n\nbeing framed in the charge-control setting postulated by Chua in his seminal paper [10];\nindeed, assuming \u03c6 to be C 1 , taking time derivatives in the equation \u03c6 = \u03c6(q) and using the\nrelations \u03c6\u2032 = v, q \u2032 = i, we are led to (1) with M(q) = \u03c6\u2032 (q). Chua and Kang considered in\n[11] the more general characteristic\nv = M(q, i)i.\n\n(2)\n\nBoth (1) and (2), but also the maps governing other devices such as capacitors or resistors,\nare particular instances of the fully nonlinear relation\nv = \u03b7(q, i)\n\n(3)\n\nto be discussed in this paper. The general characteristic (3) will give a deeper insight into\nthe mathematical properties that underly several dynamical features of memristive circuits.\nIn particular, memristors increase the dynamical degree of freedom regardless of their actual location in the circuit, contrary to capacitors or inductors which in certain (so-called\ntopologically degenerate) configurations do not increase the state dimension; additionally,\nmemristors have been observed to introduce null eigenvalues in the linearization of different circuits [25, 31]. This kind of problems can be nicely addressed in the framework here\nintroduced.\nThis will be possible because of the fact that (3), together with its dual relation\ni = \u03b6(\u03c6, v)\n\n(4)\n\nand their time-varying counterparts, allow for a surprisingly simple, albeit general, model\nfor the dynamics of nonlinear circuits including resistors, memristors, capacitors, inductors,\n\n2\n\n\fand voltage and current sources. Indeed, such a model can be written as\nq \u2032 = iq\n\u03c6\n\n\u2032\n\n(5a)\n\n= v\u03c6\n\n(5b)\n\nvq = f (q, iq , t)\n\n(5c)\n\ni\u03c6 = g(\u03c6, v\u03c6 , t)\n\n(5d)\n\n0 = Bq vq + B\u03c6 v\u03c6\n\n(5e)\n\n0 = Dq iq + D\u03c6 i\u03c6 ,\n\n(5f)\n\nwhere B = (Bq B\u03c6 ) and D = (Dq D\u03c6 ) stand for the reduced loop and cutset matrices of the\ncircuit (cf. subsection 3.1). The circuit elements (and hence B and D) are divided into socalled q- and \u03c6-devices, as detailed in Section 2. The key aspect supporting the model (5) is\nthat e.g. (5d) accommodates a great variety of devices, including flux-controlled memristors,\nlinear inductors, Josephson junctions, pn and tunnel diodes, independent current sources,\nvoltage-controlled current sources, etc.; similar remarks apply to (5c).\nThe goal of our research is two-fold: first, from a modeling point of view, we want not only\nto accommodate in circuit theory general devices governed by (3) or (4), but also emphasize\nthe fact that these characteristics allow for a very general description of the circuit dynamics,\nproviding in turn a framework for the analysis of different nonlinear phenomena; from an\nanalytical standpoint, we wish to tackle several dynamical properties of circuits with fully\nnonlinear memristors. The structure of the paper reflects the two main aspects that drive\nthis research: we address modeling issues in Section 2, and dynamical properties in Section\n3. Section 4 compiles some concluding remarks.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nDevice models\nq-devices\n\nDefinition 1. A q-device is a circuit element which admits a C 1 description of the form\nv = \u03b7(q, i, t).\n\n(6)\n\nThe terminology comes from the fact that q-devices may be controlled by the charge q (this\nwill be the case for capacitors), its time derivative q \u2032 = i (for current-controlled resistors)\nor both (for q-memristors). Voltage sources will be included in this group for the sake of\ncompleteness.\nThe relation (6) is a time-varying generalization of (3). Depending on the actual form of\nthe map \u03b7 in (6), q-devices particularize to the ones listed in Table 1. It is worth noting that\n\u03b7 need not be a scalar map; this accommodates coupling effects within the different types\nof q-devices. Keep also in mind that e.g. \u2202\u03b7/\u2202q 6\u2261 0 (resp. \u2261 0) means that this derivative\n3\n\n\fdoes not vanish (resp. does vanish) identically; in the first case, it may find a zero at certain\npoints, though; for instance, it vanishes at i = 0 in Chua's memristor, for which v = M(q)i.\n\n1. A q-memristor is a q-device for which\n\u2202\u03b7\n\u2202\u03b7\n6\u2261 0,\n6\u2261 0.\n\u2202q\n\u2202i\nThe map governing the set of q-memristors will be denoted by vm = \u03b71 (qm , im , t).\n2. A capacitor is a q-device for which\n\u2202\u03b7\n\u2202\u03b7\n6\u2261 0,\n\u2261 0.\n\u2202q\n\u2202i\nThe relation governing the set of capacitors will be denoted by vc = \u03b72 (qc , t).\n3. A current-controlled resistor is a q-device for which\n\u2202\u03b7\n\u2202\u03b7\n\u2261 0,\n6\u2261 0.\n\u2202q\n\u2202i\nThe map governing the set of current-controlled resistors will be written as vr = \u03b73 (ir , t).\n4. An independent voltage source is a q-device for which\n\u2202\u03b7\n\u2202\u03b7\n\u2261 0,\n\u2261 0.\n\u2202q\n\u2202i\nThe relation governing independent voltage sources will be denoted by vu = \u03b74 (t).\nTable 1: q-devices.\nIn a time-invariant setting, if \u03b7 is linear in i then we get Chua's memristor, for which\nv = M(q)i. For this reason we use the expression \"fully nonlinear\" to label memristors with\nthe general form v = \u03b7(q, i). This should cause no misunderstanding with the nonlinear\nnature of the original flux-charge relation \u03c6 = \u03c6(q) in Chua's setting. Note also that these\nmemristors are referred to in the literature either as charge-controlled memristors or as\ncurrent-controlled memristors; with the expression \"q-memristor\" we want to emphasize\nthat the charge q is the dynamic variable actually involved in the description of the device,\nas it will happen with the flux \u03c6 in \u03c6-memristors.\n\n4\n\n\f2.2\n\n\u03c6-devices\n\nDefinition 2. A \u03c6-device is a circuit element which admits a C 1 description of the form\ni = \u03b6(\u03c6, v, t).\n\n(7)\n\nThe different types of \u03c6-devices are enumerated in Table 2.\n1. A \u03c6-memristor is a \u03c6-device for which\n\u2202\u03b6\n\u2202\u03b6\n6\u2261 0,\n6\u2261 0.\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202v\nThe map governing the set of \u03c6-memristors will be denoted by iw = \u03b61 (\u03c6w , vw , t).\n2. An inductor is a \u03c6-device for which\n\u2202\u03b6\n\u2202\u03b6\n6\u2261 0,\n\u2261 0.\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202v\nThe relation governing the set of inductors will be denoted by il = \u03b62 (\u03c6l , t).\n3. A voltage-controlled resistor is a \u03c6-device for which\n\u2202\u03b6\n\u2202\u03b6\n\u2261 0,\n6\u2261 0.\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202v\nThe map governing the set of voltage-controlled resistors will be written as ig = \u03b63 (vg , t).\n4. An independent current source is a \u03c6-device for which\n\u2202\u03b6\n\u2202\u03b6\n\u2261 0,\n\u2261 0.\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202v\nThe relation governing independent current sources will be denoted by ij = \u03b64 (t).\nTable 2: \u03c6-devices.\nAgain, Chua's flux-controlled memristor [10], for which i = W (\u03c6)v, is obtained in particular when \u03b6 is time-independent and linear in v.\nWe do not impose any condition on the time derivatives, either for q- or \u03c6-devices. If they\nvanish in memristors, resistors, capacitors and inductors we would be led to a time-invariant\nsetting, with \u03b7k , \u03b6k (k = 1, 2, 3) being independent of t. For sources this assumption would\nmodel DC ones. It is also worth remarking that current-controlled voltage sources (CCVS's)\n5\n\n\fcould be easily included in the above taxonomy as q-devices and, similarly, voltage-controlled\ncurrent sources (VCCS's) can be modeled as \u03c6-devices.\n2.3\n\nCharacteristic matrices and passivity\n\nThe matrices of partial derivatives of the maps introduced above define the so-called characteristic matrices of the different devices.\nDefinition 3. The incremental memristance, elastance and resistance matrices of q-memristors,\ncapacitors and current-controlled resistors, respectively, are defined as\nM(qm , im , t) =\n\n\u2202\u03b71 (qm , im , t)\n\u2202\u03b72 (qc , t)\n\u2202\u03b73 (ir , t)\n, Ec (qc , t) =\n, R(ir , t) =\n.\n\u2202im\n\u2202qc\n\u2202ir\n\nAdditionally, the incremental elastance of q-memristors is\nEm (qm , im , t) =\n\n\u2202\u03b71 (qm , im , t)\n.\n\u2202qm\n\nIn Chua's memristor, for which v = M(q)i, the incremental memristance depends only\nRt\non the charge q. The fact that q(t) = \u2212\u221e im (\u03c4 )d\u03c4 makes this element behave as a resistor\nin which the resistance depends on the device history; the \"memory-resistor\" name stems\nfrom this.\nIf the elastance of capacitors is non-singular at a given operating point, then because\nof the implicit function theorem these devices admit (at least locally) a voltage-controlled\ndescription\nqc = \u03b3(vc , t).\nThe incremental capacitance matrix is then defined as\nC(vc , t) =\n\n\u2202\u03b3(vc , t)\n= (Ec (\u03b3(vc , t), t))\u22121 .\n\u2202vc\n\nNote that when a given set of devices (memristors, capacitors or resistors) does not exhibit\ncoupling effects, the corresponding characteristic matrix is a diagonal one, with diagonal\nentries defined by the memristances, elastances or resistances of the individual devices.\nThe characteristic matrices of \u03c6-devices are defined analogously, as detailed below.\nDefinition 4. The incremental memductance, reluctance and conductance matrices of \u03c6memristors, inductors and voltage-controlled resistors, respectively, are defined as\nW (\u03c6w , vw , t) =\n\n\u2202\u03b61 (\u03c6w , vw , t)\n\u2202\u03b62 (\u03c6l , t)\n\u2202\u03b63 (vg , t)\n, Rl (\u03c6l , t) =\n, G(vg , t) =\n.\n\u2202vw\n\u2202\u03c6l\n\u2202vg\n\nThe incremental reluctance of \u03c6-memristors is\nRw (\u03c6w , vw , t) =\n6\n\n\u2202\u03b61 (\u03c6w , vw , t)\n.\n\u2202\u03c6w\n\n\fAs for capacitors, if the reluctance of inductors is non-singular, then via the implicit\nfunction theorem these devices can be shown to admit a local current-controlled description\n\u03c6l = \u03be(il , t),\nand the incremental inductance matrix is defined as\nL(il , t) =\n\n\u2202\u03be(il , t)\n= (Rl (\u03be(il , t), t))\u22121 .\n\u2202il\n\nIn order to define the local notions of passivity and strict passivity, we make use of the\nconcept of a positive (semi)definite matrix; a square matrix P is positive semidefinite (resp.\ndefinite) if uT P u \u2265 0 (resp. > 0) for every non-vanishing vector u. We do not assume P to\nbe symmetric.\nDefinition 5. We call the q-memristors, capacitors, current-controlled resistors, \u03c6-memristors, inductors or voltage-controlled resistors locally passive (resp. strictly locally passive) at\na given point if the incremental memristance, elastance, resistance, memductance, inductance\nor conductance matrix is positive semidefinite (resp. definite) at that point.\nIt is easy to check that a positive definite matrix is non-singular, and that its inverse is\nitself positive definite; this means that the capacitance and inductance matrices are positive\ndefinite if the elastance and reluctance matrices of capacitors and inductors are so. No\ncondition is imposed on the elastance and reluctance matrices of q- and \u03c6-memristors, except\nfor the fact that they cannot vanish identically since otherwise these devices would amount\nto (current- or voltage-controlled) resistors. Note finally that, with terminological abuse, the\nadverb \"locally\" is often omitted when a given set of devices satisfies the (semi)definiteness\nrequirement everywhere. Similarly, the term \"incremental\" is very often omitted in the\ncharacteristic matrices.\n\n3\n\nAnalytical results: nondegeneracy, null eigenvalues\n\nThe general framework introduced in Section 2 makes it possible to address different analytical properties of memristive circuits in broad generality. After introducing some background\nmaterial in subsection 3.1, we tackle in subsections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 two particular problems\nwhich rely on linearization, emphasizing the role of the form of the different characteristic\nmatrices discussed above; specifically, the absence of memristance (resp. memductance) in\ncapacitors (resp. inductors), namely, the conditions \u2202\u03b7/\u2202i \u2261 0, \u2202\u03b6/\u2202v \u2261 0 holding for them,\ntogether with the form of the elastance and reluctance matrices for different memristors,\nwill explain certain dynamical features of memristive circuits. Our approach should also be\nuseful in future analyses of many other aspects of memristive circuit dynamics, including\ne.g. stability properties, oscillatory phenomena or bifurcations.\n7\n\n\f3.1\n\nSome auxiliary results from digraph theory\n\nMany aspects of our analysis will rely on the properties of the directed graph or digraph\nunderlying a given electrical circuit. We compile below some background material on digraph\ntheory. The reader is referred to [1, 2, 5, 14, 30] for additional details.\nWe will work with a directed graph having n nodes, m branches and k connected components. A subset K of the set of branches of a digraph is a cutset if the removal of K increases\nthe number of connected components of the digraph, and it is minimal with respect to this\nproperty, that is, the removal of any proper subset of K does not increase the number of\ncomponents. In a connected digraph, a cutset is just a minimal disconnecting set of branches.\nThe removal of the branches of a cutset increases the number of connected components by\nexactly one. Furthermore, all the branches of a cutset may be shown to connect the same\npair of connected components of the digraph which results from the deletion of the cutset.\nThis makes it possible to define the orientation of a cutset, say from one of these components\ntowards the other. The cutset matrix D\u0303 = (dij ) is then defined by\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 1 if branch j is in cutset i with the same orientation\ndij =\n\u22121 if branch j is in cutset i with the opposite orientation\n\uf8f3\n0 if branch j is not in cutset i.\n\nThe rank of D\u0303 can be proved to be n \u2212 k; any set of n \u2212 k linearly independent rows of D\u0303\ndefines a reduced cutset matrix D \u2208 R(n\u2212k)\u00d7m . In a connected digraph, any reduced cutset\nmatrix has order (n \u2212 1) \u00d7 m.\nThe space spanned by the rows of D equals the one spanned by the rows of the so-called\nincidence matrix, defined as A = (aij ) with\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 1 if branch j leaves node i\naij =\n\u22121 if branch j enters node i\n\uf8f3\n0 if branch j is not incident with node i.\n\nSimilarly, chosen an orientation in every loop, the loop matrix B\u0303 is defined as (bij ), where\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 1 if branch j is in loop i with the same orientation\nbij =\n\u22121 if branch j is in loop i with the opposite orientation\n\uf8f3\n0 if branch j is not in loop i.\n\nThe rank of this matrix equals m \u2212 n + k. A reduced loop matrix B is any ((m \u2212 n + k) \u00d7 m)submatrix of B\u0303 with full row rank.\nWe denote by BK (resp. BG\u2212K ) the submatrix of B defined by the columns which correspond to branches belonging (resp. not belonging) to a given set of branches K; the same\napplies to the cutset matrix D. Certain submatrices of B and D characterize the existence of\nso-called K-cutsets and K-loops (that is, cutsets or loops just defined by branches belonging\nto K), as stated below (cf. [30, Sect. 5.1]).\n8\n\n\fLemma 1. Let K be a subset of branches of a given digraph G. The set K does not contain\ncutsets if and only if BK has full column rank or, equivalently, iff DG\u2212K has full row rank.\nAnalogously, K does not contain loops if and only if DK has full column rank or, equivalently, iff BG\u2212K has full row rank.\nActually, the dimensions of the spaces ker BK and ker DK are defined by the number of\nlinearly independent K-cutsets and K-loops, respectively.\nThe proof of the following result can be found e.g. in [14, Sect. 7.4].\nLemma 2. If the columns of the reduced loop and cutset matrices B, D of a digraph are\narranged according to the same order of branches, then BD T = 0, DB T = 0.\nThe relations im D T = ker B and im B T = ker D hold true. This expresses that the cut\nspace im D T spanned by the rows of D can be described as ker B and, analogously, the cycle\nspace im B T spanned by the rows of B equals ker D [5]. These spaces are orthogonal to each\nother since (im D T )\u22a5 = (ker B)\u22a5 = im B T .\nFinally, when applying these results to circuit analysis, we will split the columns of B and\nD according to the nature of the devices accommodated in the corresponding branches; Bq ,\nB\u03c6 , Dq , D\u03c6 describe the submatrices of B and D defined by q- and \u03c6-devices; these matrices\nwill be further split into Bm , Bc , Br , Bu , Bw , Bl , Bg , Bj (resp. Dm , Dc etc.), according to\nthe division of q- and \u03c6-devices into q-memristors, capacitors, current-controlled resistors\nand voltage sources, and \u03c6-memristors, inductors, voltage-controlled resistors and current\nsources, respectively. With this notation, the identity BD T = 0 in Lemma 2 can be written\nas\nT\nBm Dm\n+ Bc DcT + Br DrT + Bu DuT + Bw DwT + Bl DlT + Bg DgT + Bj DjT = 0.\n\n3.2\n\n(8)\n\nNondegenerate problems and the order of complexity\n\nThe order of complexity or state dimension of an electrical circuit is the number of variables\nthat can be freely assigned an initial value. Stemming from the work of Bashkow and Bryant\n[3, 7, 8], a circuit composed of capacitors, inductors, resistors and voltage and current sources\nis said to be nondegenerate if its order of complexity equals the number of reactive elements\n(capacitors and inductors). A necessary condition for a circuit to be nondegenerate is its\ntopological nondegeneracy, that is, the absence of VC-loops (loops formed only by voltage\nsources and/or capacitors) and IL-cutsets (cutsets defined only by current sources and/or\ninductors). Different sufficient conditions can be given, involving e.g. the strict passivity of\nthe circuit matrices or the structure of the circuit spanning trees [12, 30, 32, 34, 35].\nIn Theorem 1 we address the characterization of the order of complexity of circuits with\nfully nonlinear memristors, under strict passivity assumptions and restricting the discussion to cases without VC-loops and IL-cutsets. We show that memristors, even under a\nfully nonlinear assumption, do not introduce topological degeneracies; this means that every memristor increases by one the order of complexity, regardless of its location in the\n9\n\n\fcircuit. The key difference with capacitors and inductors, which actually introduce degeneracies when entering VC-loops or IL-cutsets, is made by the fact that the characteristics of\nthese, namely, vc = \u03b72 (qc , t) and il = \u03b62 (\u03c6l , t), do not involve the current ic or the voltage vl ,\nrespectively.\nNote, in this regard, that the equations qr\u2032 = ir , qu\u2032 = iu , \u03c6\u2032g = vg , \u03c6\u2032j = vj will be excluded\nfrom the dynamical description of the circuit, since the variables qr , qu , \u03c6g , \u03c6j are decoupled\nfrom the rest of the system and are hence irrelevant from the dynamical point of view. This\nmeans that the circuit dynamics will be defined by the model\n\u2032\nqmc\n= imc\n\n(9a)\n\n\u03c6\u2032wl\n\n(9b)\n\n= vwl\n\n0 = vq \u2212 f (qmc , iq , t)\n\n(9c)\n\n0 = i\u03c6 \u2212 g(\u03c6wl, v\u03c6 , t)\n\n(9d)\n\n0 = Bq vq + B\u03c6 v\u03c6\n\n(9e)\n\n0 = Dq iq + D\u03c6 i\u03c6 ,\n\n(9f)\n\nin the understanding that qmc and \u03c6wl stand for (qm , qc ) and (\u03c6w , \u03c6l ), respectively. The\nsame splitting applies to imc and vwl . Notice that f and g group together the maps \u03b7k , \u03b6k\n(k = 1, . . . , 4) arising in Tables 1 and 2 for the sets of q- and \u03c6-devices.\nTheorem 1. Consider a circuit without VC-loops and IL-cutsets in which the memristance,\nresistance, memductance and conductance matrices M, R, W , G are positive definite. Then\nits order of complexity is given by the total number of q- and \u03c6-memristors, capacitors, and\ninductors.\nProof. We will check that the relations (9c)-(9f) make it possible to write explicitly all the\nbranch voltages and currents in terms of qm , qc , \u03c6w , \u03c6l , and that these relations impose\nno constraint among these variables in the absence of VC-loops and IL-cutsets. The way\nto do so is to check that the matrix of partial derivatives of (9c)-(9f) with respect to the\nbranch voltages and currents vq , iq , v\u03c6 , i\u03c6 , is non-singular; a straightforward application of\nthe implicit function theorem yields the result.\nThis matrix of partial derivatives has the form\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nIq \u2212Mq\n0\n0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n0\n\u2212W\u03c6 I\u03c6 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0\n(10)\nJ =\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n0\nB\u03c6\n0 \uf8f8\n\uf8ed Bq\n0\nDq\n0\nD\u03c6\nwith\nMq =\n\n\u2202g\n\u2202f\n, W\u03c6 =\n.\n\u2202iq\n\u2202v\u03c6\n10\n\n\fUsing a Schur reduction [19, 30], it is easy to see that (10) is non-singular if and only if so\nit is\n\u0012\n\u0013\nBq Mq\nB\u03c6\nJred =\n.\n(11)\nDq\nD\u03c6 W\u03c6\nAccording to the classification of q-devices into q-memristors, capacitors, resistors and\nvoltage sources, the matrix Mq has the block-diagonal structure block-diag{M, 0c , R, 0u },\nwhere M and R are the incremental memristance and resistance matrices. Analogously, W\u03c6\nreads as block-diag{W, 0l , G, 0j }. This confers the matrix Jred in (11) the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\nBm M 0 Br R 0\nBw Bl Bg Bj\n.\n(12)\nDm Dc Dr Du Dw W 0 Dg G 0\nAssume that (12) has a non-trivial left-kernel; that is, suppose that there exists a nonvanishing (xT y T ) such that the following relations hold:\nxT Bm M + y T Dm = 0\nT\n\n(13a)\n\ny Dc = 0\n\n(13b)\n\nxT Br R + y T Dr = 0\n\n(13c)\n\nT\n\ny Du = 0\n\n(13d)\n\nx Bw + y Dw W = 0\n\n(13e)\n\nxT Bl = 0\n\n(13f)\n\nx Bg + y Dg G = 0\n\n(13g)\n\nT\n\nT\n\nT\n\nT\n\nT\n\nx Bj = 0.\n\n(13h)\n\nMultiply the identity (8) from the left by xT and from the right by y. Using (13b), (13d),\n(13f) and (13h), we get\nT\nxT (Bm Dm\n+ Br DrT + Bw DwT + Bg DgT )y = 0.\n\nThis equation can be recast,using (13a), (13c), (13e) and (13g), as\nT\nxT Bm M T Bm\nx + xT Br RT BrT x + y T Dw W DwT y + y T Dg GDgT y = 0.\n\n(14)\n\nBe aware of the fact that M T and RT are positive definite since so they are M and R.\nTogether with the positive definiteness of W and G, this implies that the relations\nxT Bm = 0\nT\n\nx Br = 0\nT\n\n(15a)\n(15b)\n\ny Dw = 0\n\n(15c)\n\ny T Dg = 0\n\n(15d)\n\n11\n\n\ffollow from (14). These relations yield, in turn,\ny T Dm = 0\nT\n\n(16a)\n\ny Dr = 0\n\n(16b)\n\nxT Bw = 0\n\n(16c)\n\nT\n\nx Bg = 0.\n\n(16d)\n\nNow, the identities (13f), (13h), (15a), (15b), (16c) and (16d) imply that x = 0, because\nof the absence of VC-loops and Lemma 1. Similarly, (13b), (13d), (15c), (15d), (16a) and\n(16b), together with Lemma 1 and the absence of IL-cutsets, yield y = 0. This means that\n(12) and so J in (10) are indeed non-singular; therefore, the implicit function theorem makes\nit possible to write vq , v\u03c6 , iq , i\u03c6 in terms of qm , qc , \u03c6w and \u03c6l , and this in turn yields an\nexplicit ODE formulated in terms of the charges of q-memristors and capacitors and the\nfluxes of \u03c6-memristors and inductors. The state dimension of this ODE is obviously defined\nby the number of memristors, capacitors and inductors and the proof is complete.\n\u2737\nNote that this result applies to fully nonlinear memristors, regardless of the actual form\nof the maps \u03b71 and \u03b61 , as far as the memristance M and the memductance W are positive\ndefinite. It holds true, in particular, for Chua's memristors.\nThe different role played in this regard by q-memristors and capacitors, on the one hand,\nand by \u03c6-memristors and inductors, on the other, becomes apparent in the light of the form\nof the matrix (12). Indeed, the fact that the characteristic vc = \u03b72 (qc , t) of capacitors does\nnot involve the current ic is responsible for the vanishing block over Dc in (12). Together\nwith the null block over Du , this explains the key role of VC-loops in the state dimension\nproblem. By contrast, the presence of the M matrix within (12) makes the location of memristors irrelevant in this problem, showing that q-memristors cannot introduce topological\ndegeneracies. In particular, VCM-loops (with at least one q-memristor) do not reduce the\nstate dimension of the problem. The same reasoning applies to \u03c6-memristors, inductors,\nIL-cutsets and ILW-cutsets.\nWith more technical difficulties it is possible to show, assuming the elastance of capacitors\nand the reluctance of inductors (or, equivalently, the capacitance and the inductance) to\nbe positive definite, that the order of complexity of topologically degenerate circuits with\nfully nonlinear memristors is given by the total number of memristors plus the number\nof capacitors in a normal tree (that is, a tree including all voltage sources, the maximum\npossible number of capacitors, the minimum possible number of inductors and no current\nsource) and the number of inductors in a normal cotree. This provides an extension of\nBryant's results [7, 8] to circuits with fully nonlinear memristors.\n\n12\n\n\f3.3\n\nNull eigenvalues; regular equilibrium points\n\nMany qualitative properties of dynamical systems at equilibria can be characterized in terms\nof the linearized problem. In particular, zero eigenvalues of the linearization may be responsible for stability changes and bifurcation phenomena. In particular, within the context of\nmemristive systems, some particular circuits with Chua-type memristors have been shown\nin the literature to display null eigenvalues [25, 31]. Below we tackle this problem for general\ncircuits with fully nonlinear memristors, addressing Chua's memristors as a particular case\nwith distinctive properties.\nSystem (9) is a semiexplicit differential-algebraic equation (DAE) [6, 22, 23, 29, 30].\nEquilibrium points are defined by the vanishing of its right-hand side, and the linearization\nat a given equilibrium leads to the matrix pencil [15] \u03bbH \u2212 K, where H = block-diag{I, 0}\nand K is the Jacobian matrix of the right-hand side at equilibrium. The spectrum of the\nmatrix pencil is the set of values of \u03bb which make \u03bbH \u2212 K singular. In particular, the pencil\nhas null eigenvalues if and only if the Jacobian matrix K is singular.\nAn equilibrium point is said to be regular if and only if K is a non-singular matrix.\nRegular equilibria are important regarding DC-solvability and Newton-based computations\n[13]. The following result extends to systems with fully nonlinear memristors a property\nalready known for RLC circuits [16, 17, 24]. With the same terminological convention,\na VLW-loop is a loop defined by voltage sources, inductors and/or \u03c6-memristors, and an\nICM-cutset is a cutset including only current sources, capacitors and/or q-memristors.\nTheorem 2. Consider a memristive circuit with positive definite incremental resistance and\nconductance matrices R, G. An equilibrium point of this circuit is regular if and only if\n\u2022 the elastances Em , Ec of q-memristors and capacitors, as well as the reluctances Rw ,\nRl of \u03c6-memristors and inductors, are non-singular at the equilibrium; and\n\u2022 the circuit does not have either VLW-loops or ICM-cutsets.\nProof.

Conversely, in order to show that the absence of\nthese configurations guarantees Kred to be non-singular, it suffices to check that a columnreordering gives this matrix the form of Jred in (11); proceeding exactly as in the proof of\nTheorem 1, and using only the positive definiteness of R and G, it is easy to check that\nin the absence of VLW-loops and ICM-cutsets the matrix Kred (and then K) is actually\nnon-singular, as we aimed to show.\n\u2737\nMore is true, actually; proceeding as in Theorem 3 below, one can show that, in problems\nin which the elastance of q-memristors and capacitors and the reluctance of \u03c6-memristors\nand inductors are non-singular, the geometric multiplicity of the zero eigenvalue of K equals\nthe number of independent VLW-loops and independent ICM-cutsets, where the notion of\nindependence relies on the cut- and cycle-spaces described in subsection 3.1.\n3.4\n\nNull eigenvalues in circuits with Chua-type memristors\n\nA distinct feature of Chua's memristors is that the elastance Em = \u2202\u03b71 /\u2202qm and the reluctance Rw = \u2202\u03b61 /\u2202\u03c6w do vanish at equilibrium points, because \u03b71 (qm , im ) = M(qm )im\nand \u03b61 (\u03c6w , vw ) = W (\u03c6w )vw are linear in im and vw , respectively, and the identities im = 0,\nvw = 0 hold at equilibria. Theorem 2 above then predicts the existence of null eigenvalues\nin Chua-type memristive circuits owing to this zero-crossing property, as already observed\nin specific examples [25, 31]. The number of memristive devices actually characterizes the\n14\n\n\fgeometric multiplicity of the zero eigenvalue in a broad class of circuits with Chua-type\nmemristors, as detailed below.\nTheorem 3. Consider a circuit in which the elastance Em of q-memristors and the reluctance Rw of \u03c6-memristors do vanish at equilibria. If the resistance and conductance\nmatrices R, G are positive definite at a given equilibrium, and the elastance Ec of capacitors and the reluctance Rl of inductors (equivalently, the capacitance and the inductance)\nare non-singular, then the geometric multiplicity of the null eigenvalue equals the number of\nmemristors, independent VL-loops and independent IC-cutsets.\nProof. Making Em = 0 and Rw = 0 in (18), the corank of the matrix K can be easily seen\nto equal the number of (q- and \u03c6-) memristors plus the corank of\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0\n0\nIm 0 0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0 0\n\uf8ec \u2212Ec\n0\n0 Ic 0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0\n\uf8f7\n0\n0\n0\nI\n\u2212R\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nr\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nI\n0\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nw\n(20)\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8ec 0\n\u2212Rl 0\n0 0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0 Il 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0\n\uf8f7\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\u2212G\n0\n0\n0\nI\ng\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed 0\n0\nBm Bc Br 0\n0 Bg Bj 0\n0 0 \uf8f8\n0\n0\n0\n0 0 Dr Du 0\n0 Dw Dl Dg\nThe corank of (20) in turn equals that of\n\u0012\n\u0013\nBc Ec\n0\nBr R 0\nBg Bj\n.\n0\nDl Rl Dr Du Dg G 0\n\n(21)\n\nContrary to (19), (21) is not a square matrix, and its corank is defined by the dimension of\nits (right) kernel. A vector (u, v, w, x, y, z) of the kernel of this matrix verifies\nBc Ec u = 0\n\n(22a)\n\nBr Rw = 0\n\n(22b)\n\nBg y = 0\n\n(22c)\n\nBj z = 0\n\n(22d)\n\nDl Rl v = 0\n\n(22e)\n\nDr w = 0\n\n(22f)\n\nDu x = 0\n\n(22g)\n\nDg Gy = 0.\n\n(22h)\n\nThe relations (22) imply that (0, Ec u, Rw, 0, 0, 0, y, z) \u2208 ker (Bm Bc Br Bu Bw Bl Bg Bj ) =\nker B, and (0, 0, w, x, 0, Rlv, Gy, 0) \u2208 ker (Dm Dc Dr Du Dw Dl Dg Dj ) = ker D. Use then\n15\n\n\fthe identities ker B = im D T and ker D = im B T to derive the existence of vectors p, q\nsatisfying\nT\n0 = Dm\np, Ec u = DcT p, Rw = DrT p, 0 = DuT p, 0 = DwT p, 0 = DlT p, y = DgT p, z = DjT p,\nT\n0 = Bm\nq, 0 = BcT q, w = BrT q, x = BuT q, 0 = BwT q, Rl v = BlT q, Gy = BgT q, 0 = BjT q.\n\nPre- and post-multiplying (8) by q T and p, respectively, we get, in the light of these identities,\nw T Rw + y T GT y = 0,\nthat is, w = y = 0 because of the positive definiteness of R and G. Then (Ec u, z) belongs to\nker (Bc Bj ) and (x, Rl v) belongs to ker (Du Dl ). Due to the non-singular nature of Ec and\nRl , this means that the corank of (20) equals the number of independent IC-cutsets plus the\nnumber of independent VL-loops (cf. subsection 3.1). Hence, the corank of the matrix K,\nand therefore the geometric multiplicity of its null eigenvalue, equals the number of (q- and\n\u03c6-) memristors plus the number of independent VL-loops and the number of independent\nIC-cutsets, as we aimed to show.\n\u2737\nIn particular, in circuits without VL-loops and IC-cutsets, the geometric multiplicity\nof the null eigenvalue matches exactly the number of memristors; this is the case in the\nexamples arising in [25, 31].\n\n4\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nThe fully nonlinear characteristics (3) and (4) introduced in the present paper might accommodate future devices arising in nonlinear circuit theory and displaying memristive effects,\nor provide more accurate models for already existing devices. The general form of these\nrelations and their time-varying counterparts allows for a simple description of a very broad\nclass of electrical and electronic circuits; different dynamical features of these can be then\naddressed in great generality. Several of these features can be understood to follow from\nthe special form of the characteristic matrices of the different devices arising in the analysis. For instance, the zero-crossing property of Chua-type memristors makes them display a\nvanishing elastance and reluctance at equilibria; from Theorems 1 and 3, it then follows that\nin strictly passive circuits with Chua-type memristors, not exhibiting VC-loops, IL-cutsets,\nVL-loops or IC-cutsets, the order of complexity equals the number of memristors plus reactive elements, every memristor introducing a vanishing natural frequency in the linearized\nproblem. Similarly, the absence of null eigenvalues is characterized, for general memristive\ncircuits and in terms of the circuit matrices and the digraph topology, in Theorem 2. The\ncharacterization of other analytical properties of memristive circuits within the framework\nhere introduced defines the scope of future research.\n\n16\n\n\fReferences\n[1] B.
