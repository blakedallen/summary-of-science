The field has\nsince expanded, with the two-phase technique now being applied to WIMP dark matter\nsearches, with coherent neutrino scattering and double \u03b2-decay experiments proposed [3,\n4]. Some of these applications require detection of very small signals from rare events,\ndemanding high sensitivity from the technique.\nIn the case of two-phase xenon, the interaction between an incident particle and a liquid\nxenon target produces prompt scintillation photons [5, 6] in the vacuum ultra-violet (VUV)\nwith \u03bb \u2243 175 nm (FWHM \u2243 14 nm) [7, 8]. With no external electric field applied, ionization\nelectrons created by the interaction will recombine, increasing the scintillation signal. By\napplying an electric field across the liquid, some electrons can be extracted from the interaction site, to be detected independently. The currently favoured method of low level charge\ndetection from a liquid target relies on using the electroluminescence process to convert the\nionization signal into a proportional photon yield in the gas phase. Upon reaching the liquid\nsurface, the ionization electrons must be emitted into the gas, a process dependent upon the\nelectric field perpendicular to the surface [9]. Measurements of the emission coefficient in\nxenon, i.e. the fraction of electrons emitted into the gas, show that extraction approaches\nunity at 5 kV/cm [10]. Once in the gas phase, the electrons are accelerated by a stronger\nelectric field, exciting the gas atoms through collisions and causing the production of secondary VUV scintillation photons. This electroluminescence process has been simulated and\nmeasured previously [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16], although some disagreement still remains over\nthe absolute number of photons produced per electron.\nPresented here is the first study quantifying the response to the emission of a single\nionization electron in a two-phase noble gas detector. In two-phase argon, a triple-GEM\nstructure used for charge amplification in the gas has recently been reported to achieve\nsingle-electron sensitivity, although this study relied on electrons photo-produced in the\nfirst GEM rather than emitted from the liquid phase [17].\nIn this article the single electron response of a two-phase xenon detector is described and\nthe origin of the ionization electrons considered. Sensitivity to single ionization electrons is\nimportant in experiments searching for very small, rare events. On a technical level, it allows\nfor a direct measurement of the ionization yields of different interacting particles, such as\n2\n\n\fnuclear and electron recoils, and may help with the study of photoionization processes in\nliquid xenon. Understanding the origin of these electrons may highlight new backgrounds\nfor experiments relying on the detection of even smaller ionization signatures than those\nconsidered of interest in WIMP dark matter searches, which motivated this particular study.\nOne such example is the proposed detection of keV energy deposits from coherent neutrino\nscattering [4].\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic of the ZEPLIN-II detector. The liquid and gaseous xenon regions are shown,\nalong with the electric field electrodes and the array of PMTs detecting VUV photons.\n\nThis work was carried out using ZEPLIN-II, a two-phase xenon detector searching for\nWIMP dark matter. The detector uses a 31 kg liquid xenon (LXe) target, held in a truncated\ncone of reflective PTFE, 140 mm deep with upper and lower diameters of 324 mm and 290\nmm (Fig. 1). The liquid surface lies between two meshes separated by 10 mm, where a\nstrong electric field can be applied to produce electroluminescence from emitted electrons.\nThe details of the detector design, operation and primary analysis are detailed in Ref.\n[18]. The extraction electrodes consist of a woven stainless steel mesh of 30 \u03bcm diameter\nwire, with a centre-to-centre separation of 500 \u03bcm. The electrons are drifted towards the\nextraction region by a vertical 1 kV/cm electric field; upon reaching the liquid surface,\nthey are emitted into the gas by an electric field of \u223c4.8 kV/cm and accelerated across the\n2-3 mm gas gap by a field \u2243 9.5 kV/cm. Both the primary (scintillation) and secondary\n(electroluminescence) signals are independently detected by the same array of seven photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). The time taken for the electrons to drift through the liquid\nprovides separation in time proportional to the depth in the detector.\nIn this work data from the 31-day shielded run of ZEPLIN-II was used to search for evidence of single electron emission into the gas phase. During this run the average background\nrate from gamma-ray interactions was \u223c2 events/s (>5 keV). An unexpected population of\nvery small secondary-like signals immediately following large secondaries was apparent dur3\n\n\fing early tests. Some of these signals were also observed between the primary and secondary\npulses associated with normal events and these were selected for further analysis.\nThe response of the detector to a single electron emitted from the liquid is predicted to be\nsmall, yielding fewer than 10 photoelectrons across the array of seven PMTs. To search for\nthese small signals, quiet timelines free from spurious noise, overlapping events and optical\nfeedback effects are required. For this reason the search for candidate single electron signals\nwas carried out on the high-quality, low-background dataset used for WIMP searches and\nanalysed in Ref. [18]. From this dataset, only events triggered by the primary scintillation\nsignal were selected in order not to bias the single electron signal distribution. The trigger\nfunction is a five-fold coincidence at the level of a third of a single PMT photoelectron (phe).\n\nFIG. 2: Seven-PMT sum waveform containing a candidate single electron event. The primary\nscintillation pulse (p4) and secondary electroluminescence pulse (p6) are clearly visible, with the\nsingle electron (p5) occuring in the quiet section of the timeline between the two.\n\nFig. 2 shows an example of an 80 \u03bcs waveform (sampled at 2 ns) containing a primary\nscintillation pulse and a secondary electroluminescence pulse, with a single electron candidate extracted in the intervening time. The single electron pulse is detected as a collection\nof individual PMT photoelectrons spread over a \u223c500 ns period, the time taken for the\nelectron to cross the high-field electroluminescence region.\nIn the analysis described in Ref. [18], the data were corrected for the finite electron\nlifetime in the liquid as well as operational parameters which affect the gain of the ionization\nchannel (such as variations of pressure, liquid level and electric fields). In this analysis the\n'purity' correction, compensating the secondary scintillation signal for trapping of electrons\nby electronegative impurities during their drift to the liquid surface, is not required as a\n4\n\n\fsingle electron will either reach the surface or be trapped, meaning no partial loss of signal.\nThe other operational parameters are considered as variables.\nA pulse area histogram of all small signals detected between primary and secondary\npulses, representing the number of photoelectrons detected by the PMTs, is shown in Fig.\n3. The mean area of a single phe pulse for each PMT is independently measured. The\nfigure shows a clear population which we attribute to single electrons, along with an exponential noise pedestal. The distribution of single electrons is fitted with a gaussian function.\nAlthough phe statistics suggest a Poisson distribution, further broadening occurs due to\nelectronic noise and other fluctuations. The spectrum shows the single electron mean of\n8.8\u00b10.4 phe and a width \u03c3=5.0 phe. As discussed later this corresponds to over 200 VUV\nphotons, demonstrating the large gain of the ionization channel.\n\nFIG. 3: Example of a single electron spectrum, with gas pressure of 1.5 bar. The continuous line\nshows the fit to the entire spectrum; the Gaussian and exponential components are also shown.\nThe inset shows the gaussian plus exponential fit parameters.\n\nThe number of electroluminescence photons created by one electron depends on the pressure, electric field and gas thickness. The electroluminescence yield of xenon, defined as the\nnumber of VUV photons produced per electron per cm travelled, has been studied mainly\nfor gas at room temperature (see [16] and references therein). A dependence is found of\nthe form Y = aE \u2212 bPeq , where a and b are experimentally determined parameters, E is\nthe electric field in the gas and Peq is the equivalent pressure for the same gas density at\n0 \u25e6 C. It is known that the photon yield in the cold, saturated vapour is higher than that in\nthe warm gas (for the same density). This effect is clearly shown in Ref. [14], where the\nroom temperature measurement is consistent with other published results, but the yield in\n5\n\n\fthe vapour is clearly higher. We note that for the mesh design and thickness of the gas\nlayer mentioned previously, a parallel and uniform electric field can be assumed without\nsignificant error. This permits direct calculation of the absolute electroluminescence yield\nin ZEPLIN-II. If the small signals under scrutiny correspond to the emission of a single\nelectron, this yield must agree with that measured for the cold vapour and show the same\npressure dependence.\nXe Number Density (x1025 m-3)\n5\n\n5.5\n\n6\n\n6.5\n\n7\n\n7.5\n\nMean Single Electron Response, phe\n\n16\nThis work\nFonseca et al.

The shaded\nbands represent uncertainties assigned to these predictions, including an ad-hoc 10% error assumed\nfor parameters a and b (not given in the literature).\n\nGas pressure, P , is one of the main operational parameters affecting the size of the\nsingle electron response in the detector, doing so in two complementary ways: it affects\nelectroluminescence at a microscopic level and is also directly linked to the liquid level\nthrough thermal expansion of the liquid, which is in thermal equilibrium with the gas. The\nthermal expansion causes variation in the electric field in the gas, although this contribution\nis small. Previous yield measurements can be compared directly with the results from\nZEPLIN-II by factoring in the thickness of the gas region, d, the light collection efficiency,\n\u03b7=0.24, and the quantum efficiency, QE=0.17, of the PMTs. The gas thickness is calculated\nfrom the drift time of background interactions occurring very near the lower extraction grid\njust under the liquid surface; the light collection was simulated by Monte Carlo; there is some\nuncertainty about the variation of PMT QE down to low temperatures for this particular\nphototube model, which we believe to be small. Fig. 4 shows the mean single electron\nresponse (in phe), QE \u03b7 d(P ) Y (P ), demonstrating the expected inverse dependence with\n6\n\n\fxenon pressure over the range 1.2\u20131.9 bar, the variation observed during the science data\nrun. Both the absolute yield of VUV photons and the dependence on pressure are in good\nagreement with predictions made from the previous measurements of electroluminescence\nyield, providing strong evidence that the population observed is indeed from single electrons.\nIn ZEPLIN-II position reconstruction in the horizontal plane uses a simple centroid\nmethod, which naturally lacks precision for small signals such as those from single electrons. However, the reconstructed radial distribution (shown in Fig. 5) suggests an origin\ndistributed over all radii which is clearly incompatible with that of small ionization signals\noriginating from the detector walls (corresponding to a radius of 0.7 a.u.). The later is a\nknown background of nuclear recoils arising from plating of the walls with alpha-emitters\nfrom radon decay in the Xe [18]. Furthermore the depth (electron drift time) distribution\ndemonstrates relatively uniform production throughout the whole liquid xenon bulk.\n\nFIG. 5: Radial (top) and depth (bottom) distributions of single electrons measured. In radial plot\nthe solid line shows the single electron population, with the dashed line showing the distribution\nof small ionization signals (\u223cfew electrons) from detector walls [18].\n\nThe fact that large secondary signals are seen to be followed by multiple single electron\npulses suggests their production may be related to the number of VUV photons present in\nthe chamber. The quiet timelines found between primary and secondary signals, together\nwith the proportionality between the primary signal and the energy deposited, allow testing\nof this hypothesis in a quantitative manner. Fig. 6 shows the fraction of events where a single\nelectron is observed as a function of energy (proportional to the number of VUV scintillation\n7\n\n\fphotons generated in the liquid). A clear dependence on energy is observed, suggesting that\nthe production of single electrons could be, at least in part, due to photoionization processes\nin the liquid bulk.\nNumber of Scintillation Photons\n8\n\n0\n\n250\n\n500\n\n750\n\n1000\n\n1250\n\n1500\n\n1750\n\n2000\n\nElectron rate, %\n\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nEnergy, keV\n\nFIG. 6: Relative rates of single electrons as a function of the size of the primary signal (normalized\nto gamma-ray energies). The rate is given as the percentage of timelines checked which contain\nsingle electron signals.\n\nThe mean free path (mfp) of \u22437.1 eV (\u03bb \u2243 175 nm) scintillation photons for generating\nan electron in the liquid can be estimated from the event frequency shown in Fig. 6. A\nscintillation yield of 39 photons/keV at 1 kV/cm has been measured, indicating an average\n39,000 scintillation photons are required to produce an electron. Photons generated in the\nliquid can escape from the surface or be absorbed in the surrounding PTFE reflectors or\nin the electrodes. A Monte Carlo simulation places the mean escape length in the liquid\nxenon at \u223c25 cm for photons generated uniformly throughout the liquid. The latter value\nis not significantly affected by bulk absorption for the xenon purity considered here, or by\nRayleigh scattering. This places the photon mfp for photoionization at \u223c1.0x106 cm.\nSeveral chemical species can be responsible, mainly related to impurites present in the\nliquid xenon. Unfortunately, the mfp depends on both the microscopic cross-section and\nthe atom concentration, and so none can be ruled out with certainty since either (or both)\nquantities may be unknown.\nSub-threshold photoionization, either of impurities or of xenon atoms, dimers and higher\norder polymers, cannot be ruled out, even if they are unlikely. Some of the most abundant impurities are electronegative species (such as O2 , H2 O, N2 O, etc) responsible for the\nfinite electron lifetime, and their concentration can be estimated from the rate of electron\nattachment. From known attachment cross-sections [19] and considering an average energy\n8\n\n\fof 0.1 eV for electrons drifting in a 1 kV/cm electric field [20], we estimate that an O2\nconcentration of \u223c60 ppb or a N2 O concentration of just \u223c8 ppb would produce the \u223c100\n\u03bcs electron lifetime observed during this ZEPLIN-II run. The photoionization cross-section\nneeded to explain the measured mfp is only \u223c0.001 Mb (compared to 10-100 Mb typically\nfound well above threshold). In the case of intrinsic photoionization (the threshold in liquid\nxenon is 9.3 eV [21]) the large atom density of \u223c1022 cm\u22123 means that a cross-section as\nlow as 35 \u03bcb is sufficient. So, although sub-threshold photoionization is very unlikely, the\ninteraction probabilities required are also extremely small; in addition, the non-zero width\nof the scintillation emission will play a favourable role. Alternatively, minute concentrations\nof other species with low ionization thresholds may be responsible. Of these there are many\ncandidates, both organic and inorganic. In addition to neutral species, it is also possible\nthat negative ions previously created by electron attachment can be photoionised during\ntheir long drift towards the anode, which is as slow as \u223c0.7 cm/s for an O\u2212\n2 ion in liquid\nxenon at 1 kV/cm [25]. However, the concentration of O\u2212\n2 ions accumulated from electron\nattachment during calibration and background runs seems insufficient to explain the rate\nobserved. It is also believed that these ions do not affect the electroluminescence field by\nmore than 10%. Finally, we mention photoionization induced by the well-known 'n=1' exciton in liquid xenon, which lies below the intrinsic threshold at 8.4 eV [22, 23, 24]. Although\nexcitons do not cause photoionization directly, they can transfer the excitation to impurities\nonto which they become trapped and ionise them in a Penning-type interaction. Clearly,\nfurther work is required to establish the most likely species undergoing photoionization in\nliquid xenon systems due to luminescence photons.\nIn summary, a population of small signals in the ZEPLIN-II low-background data were\ninvestigated and identified as single ionization electrons emitted into the gas region. The\nelectroluminescence yield shows good agreement with previous measurements for saturated\nxenon vapour, also displaying the expected pressure dependence. The detection of single\nelectrons shows the excellent sensitivity of two-phase xenon systems in the ionization channel, vital for high-sensitivity experiments such as WIMP dark matter searches. The production of electrons occurs throughout the liquid xenon, with photoionization of contaminant\nspecies (either directly or exciton-induced) being the most probable production mechanism.\nThis may have possible implications for future experiments, as single electrons not directly\nrelated to particle interactions in the xenon could constitute an additional background when\n9\n\n\fsearching for very small ionization signals.\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the work of the ZEPLIN-II collaboration\nand thank D.
