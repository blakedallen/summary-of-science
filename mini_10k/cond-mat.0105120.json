It is therefore\nnot surprising that the Kondo effect in N-QD-S hybrid\nsystems has attracted considerable attention7\u201311 . So far,\nthe focus on Kondo effects in N-QD-S devices has been on\nenhancement or reduction of conductance as compared to\nthat of N-QD-N systems7,8,10 ; and the emergence of subKondo peaks in LDOS at \u00b1\u22067,8 where \u2206 is the superconductor gap energy. In these studies Andreev tunneling precesses, in essence, happen alone while the Cooper\npairs do not participate the formation of spin-singlet.\nHowever, since the Kondo effect in a QD results from\nco-tunneling processes, for a N-QD-S hybrid system, it is\nvery natural to ask: are there co-tunneling processes consisting of one virtual Andreev tunneling and one virtual\nnormal electron tunneling? If there are, can coherent superpositions of these Andreev-normal co-tunneling give\nrise to a Kondo effect? What are the consequences and\ncharacteristics of the Kondo effect induced this way?\nIt is the purpose of this letter to report our theoretical investigation on these issues. In contrast to previous\nwork7\u201311 , we emphasize the possibility of virtual Andreev\ntunneling directly participating the co-tunneling process\nso that the Cooper pairs directly participate formation\nof the spin-singlet: these physical processes give rise to\nKondo effect in the first place. Our results predicts a\nnew co-tunneling process formed by an Andreev tunneling and a normal tunneling, and the superposition of this\ntype processes induce four Kondo peaks in the LDOS.\nWe consider the standard model Hamiltonian12 of a\nN-QD-S system H = HN + HS + HQD + HT where\nP\nP\n\u2020\n\u2020\nH\nk\u03c3 \u01ebSk bk\u03c3 bk\u03c3 +\nk\u03c3 \u01ebN k ak\u03c3 ak\u03c3 and HS =\nPN =\nk (\u2206bk\u2193 b\u2212k\u2191 + H.c.) describe the normal lead and the\nsuperconducting lead, respectively, in here we have set\nP\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u03bcS = 0.

The effects of intradot Coulomb interaction and Andreev tunneling give rise to Andreev bound resonances. As a result, a new type of co-tunneling process which\nwe term Andreev-normal co-tunneling, is predicted. At low\ntemperatures, coherent superposition of these co-tunneling\nprocesses induces a Kondo effect in which Cooper pairs directly participate formation of a spin singlet, leading to four\nKondo resonance peaks in the local density of states, and enhancing the tunneling current.\n72.15Qm, 73.40Gk, 72.15Nj\n\nThe Kondo effect is a prototypical many-body correlation effect involving interactions between a localized\nspin and free electrons.1 Its recent observation in semiconductor quantum dots (QD)2\u20134 has generated a great\ndeal of theoretical and experimental interests and provided rich understanding to many-body phenomena at\nthe mesoscopic scale.5 For a QD coupled to two normal\n(N) leads, the physical origin of the Kondo effect is now\nunderstood1,2,4 . Consider a single spin degenerate level\n\u01ebd of the QD such that \u01ebd < \u03bcN < \u01ebd + U , where \u03bcN is\nthe chemical potential of the leads and U the on-site e-e\ninteraction energy. An electron of either spin up or spin\ndown which occupies \u01ebd cannot tunnel out of the QD\nbecause \u01ebd < \u03bcN ; as well, an electron outside the QD\ncannot tunnel into it unless the on-site Coulomb energy\nU is overcome. Therefore, the first-order tunneling process is Coulomb blockaded. However, due to Heisenberg\nuncertainty, the virtual higher-order co-tunneling events\ncan still take place1,2,4 by which the electron inside QD\ntunnels out followed by an electron with opposite spin\ntunneling into the QD, on a time scale \u223c h\u0304/|\u03bcN \u2212 \u01ebd |.\nAs a consequence, the local spin is flipped. At low temperatures, the coherent superposition of all possible cotunneling events gives rise to the Kondo effect in which\nthe time-averaged spin in the QD is zero due to frequent\nspin flips: the whole system, QD plus leads, forms a spin\nsinglet, and a very narrow Kondo peak located at \u03bcN\narises in the local density of states (LDOS).\nWhen one of the leads is a superconductor (S), another transport process-Andreev tunneling, will occur\nin the normal-superconductor interface in which an incident electron from the normal side is reflected as a\nhole while a Cooper pair is created in the superconductor. Andreev tunneling is very important6 because\n\n1\n\n\fretarded and Keldysh Green's functions Gr and G< for\nthe QD in the well known Nambu representation12 .\nWe have solved Gr (\u01eb) using the equation of motion\nmethod. Although this method is quantitatively less\naccurate in predicting intensity of Kondo effect, it has\nbeen proven to provide correct qualitative physics at low\ntemperatures13 , therefore it is sufficient for the purpose\nof this work. Then we obtain the matrix form of Gr (\u01eb)\nas,14\n\nwhere \u03a30 is the exact self-energy for noninteracting system. Then, from \u03a3< \u2212\u03a3> = \u03a3r \u2212\u03a3a , it is easy to determine X = \u03a3r \u2212 \u03a3a . This ansatz has several advantages:\n(i) it is exact both in equilibrium (the bias Vb = 0) and in\nnoninteracting limit (U = 0); (ii) when \u2206 = 0, it is consistent with the original ansatz of Ng17 ; (iii) the current\nconservation is automatically satisfied; (iv) it guarantees\n<\u2217\nthe exact relation of matrix elements G<\n12 (\u01eb) = \u2212G21 (\u01eb),\n\u2020 \u2020\nwhich in turn guarantees < d\u2193 d\u2191 >=< d\u2191 d\u2193 >\u2217 ; (v)\n!\n(0)\n(0)\n(b)\n(0)\n(b)\n(0)\nab\n\u01eb \u2212 \u01ebd \u2212 \u03a311 + U A1 B(\u03a3ab\n11 + \u03a3S;12 A2 \u03a3S;21 ) \u2212\u03a3S;12 \u2212 U A1 B(\u03a3S;12 + \u03a3S;12 A2 \u03a322 )\nGr\n(b)\n(0)\n(b)\n(0)\n(0)\n(0)\nab\nA\n\u03a3\n)\n\u2212\u03a3S;21 + U A2 B(\u03a3S;21 + \u03a3S;21 A1 \u03a3ab\n)\n\u01eb\n+\n\u01eb\n\u2212\n\u03a3\n\u2212\nU\nA\nB(\u03a3\n+\n\u03a3\n1\nd\n2\n11\n22\n22\nS;21\nS;12\n!\n(0)\n(0)\n1 + U A1 B(n\u2193 + \u03a3S;12 A2 < d\u2020\u2191 d\u2020\u2193 >), U A1 B(< d\u2193 d\u2191 > \u2212\u03a3S;12 A2 n\u2191 )\n=\n(0)\n(0)\n\u2020 \u2020\nU A2 B(< d\u2191 d\u2193 > +\u03a3S;21 A1 n\u2193 ),\n1 \u2212 U A2 B(n\u2191 \u2212 \u03a3S;21 A1 < d\u2193 d\u2191 >)\n(2)\n\nwhere Ai (\u01eb)(i = 1, 2) and B(\u01eb) are defined as Ai (\u01eb) \u2261 [\u01eb\u2213\n(0)\n(0)\n(1)\n(0)\n\u01ebd \u2213 U \u2212 2\u03a3ii \u2212 \u03a3ii ]\u22121 ; B(\u01eb) \u2261 [1 \u2212 \u03a3S;12A2 \u03a3S;21 A1 ]\u22121 ;\nand the self-energies \u03a3 = \u03a3N + \u03a3S are:\nX V 2 \u0012 \u01eb+ \u2212\u2206 \u0013\n(0)\nS\nSk\n\u03a3S (\u01eb) =\n,\n\u2212\u2206 \u01eb\u2212\nE\nSk\n\n<\nG<\n11 (\u01eb) and G22 (\u01eb) automatically becomes purely imaginary. In this regard, we note that Ref. 11 proposed to\nuse only the first term of Eq.(3) as \u03a3< . At least for\nour purpose this choice is not correct because our matrices in (3) are non-diagonal therefore cannot be permuted,\nand more importantly, it generates result violating points\n(iv) and (v). Finally, using (3), G< is obtained from the\nKeldysh equation G< = Gr \u03a3< Ga where Ga = (Gr )\u2020 .\nWith Green's functions Gr and G< , from Eq.(1) the current I is calculated immediately.\nTo gain physical insights to the analytical result, in\nthe rest of the paper we discuss them numerically. In\nour numerical calculations, we assume square bands of\nwidth 2W so that \u0393N/S (\u01eb) = \u0393N/S \u03b8(W \u2212 |\u01eb|), with\nW = 1000 \u226b max(kB T, Vb , \u0393, \u2206). We emphatically investigate the case when \u2206 > \u0393S and with asymmetrical barriers, \u0393S > \u0393N . In this case, an electron with\nenergy |\u01eb| < \u2206 in the QD undergoes multiple Andreev\nreflections before it decays to the normal lead, and it\ncannot decay into the superconductor due to the gap.\nThese multiple reflections give rise to Andreev bound\nstates in the QD which are indicated by the peaks in the\nLDOS18 . Fig.(1a) shows LDOS at a high temperature\nT =p\n0.5. If U = 0, two Andreev bound states emerge\nat \u00b1 \u01eb2d + \u03932S /4 (when \u2206 \u226b \u0393S \u226b \u0393N ). When U becomes finite, due to a competition of intradot Coulomb\ninteraction and Andreev tunneling, each U = 0 Andreev\nbound state is split into two sub-states an energy U apart.\nAs a result, four Andreev bound state peaks emerge in\nthe LDOS each with half-width set by \u0393N . Note that\nfor large interactions U \u2192 \u221e, Andreev reflections are\nCoulomb blockaded therefore only two ordinary resonance peaks at \u01ebd and \u01ebd + U can be detected in LDOS.\nNext, we drop the temperature to T = 0.005 so that\nKondo effect can be investigated, the data shown in\nFig.(1b). In LDOS, the four broad peaks correspond to\nthe four Andreev bound states just discussed. On top of\nthem, four additional narrow peaks emerge.

The self-energy \u03a3N for the coupling to\nthe normal lead can easy be obtained from \u03a3S by setting\n\u2206 = 0 and substituting (VS , \u01ebSk , bk\u03c3 ) by (VN , \u01ebN k , ak\u03c3 ).\nThe quantity n\u03c3 in Eq.(2) is the intradot electron occupation number of state \u03c3; < d\u2193 d\u2191 > and < d\u2020\u2191 d\u2020\u2193 > are\nthe pair correlation in the QD due to the well known\nproximity effect. These quantities must be calculated\nself-consistently7,15 . We emphasis that Eq.(2) is suitable for arbitrary Coulomb interaction strength U and\nsuperconducting gap \u2206. In the zero-gap limit so that\nthe superconducting lead becomes a normal lead, Eq.(2)\nreduces to that of the N-QD-N system16 .\nNext, we solve the Keldysh Green's function G< (\u01eb)\nwhich, for interacting systems, can not be obtained from\nthe equation of motion without introducing additional\nassumptions. We follow the most commonly used ansatz\nfor interacting lesser (greater) self-energy \u03a3\u03b1 (\u03b1 =< and\n>), due to Ng17 , but we generalize this ansatz to mesoscopic hybrid systems in the following way,\n\u03a3\u03b1 =\n\n\u0003\n1\u0002 \u03b1 r\n(3)\n\u03a30 (\u03a30 \u2212 \u03a3a0 )\u22121 X + X(\u03a3r0 \u2212 \u03a3a0 )\u22121 \u03a3\u03b1\n0\n2\n2\n\n\fannihilated, a Cooper pair is created in the superconductor, the spin of the QD is flipped and a net current flows\nthrough the QD. At low temperatures, a coherent superposition of all possible co-tunneling processes of this kind\nproduces the Kondo effect. The entire system, QD plus\nleads and including the Cooper pair, forms a spin singlet. The local spin is effectively screened and two very\nnarrow Kondo peaks emerge at \u01eb = \u03bcN and \u2212\u03bcN in the\nLDOS. The new physics here is that Andreev tunneling\ncan directly participate co-tunneling processes, in other\nwords the Cooper pair can directly participate formation\nof the spin singlet.\nThird, the excess Kondo peak at 2\u01ebd + U \u2212 \u03bcN is from\nthe Andreev assisted co-tunneling process. An Andreev\nevent involves a two-particle tunneling process, hence the\nelectron number in QD can fluctuate by two. In particular, when \u0393S > \u0393N , Andreev tunneling occurs more\nfrequently than normal tunneling, therefore the probability for QD to have zero- or two-occupancy is greatly\nenhanced. This induces the following co-tunneling process. When QD is empty, an electron with energy \u223c \u03bcN\nin the normal lead can tunnel into the QD state \u01ebd , following closely by another electron having opposite spin\nand energy \u223c 2\u01ebd + U \u2212 \u03bcN tunneling on to the state\n\u01ebd + U . If the QD begins with a two-occupancy, the inverse process can occur. These co-tunneling processes\ninduce the Kondo peak at 2\u01ebd + U \u2212 \u03bcN . Notice that the\nelectron fluctuation is two in these co-tunneling process,\nso it only occurs under the assistance of Andreev tunneling. Finally, the Kondo peak at \u22122\u01ebd \u2212 U + \u03bcN originates\nfrom a combination of the processes discussed in this and\nthe last paragraph.\nThe above picture clearly indicates the physical process\nbehind the excess Kondo peaks. Is the tunneling current\nenhanced by these excess Kondo resonances? The inset of\nFig.(1c) plots current versus \u01ebd at bias Vb = 0.5. A finite\nbias makes the conventional Kondo peak at \u03bcN not to\nalign with \u03bcS , so that this peak alone contributes weakly\nto current. At low temperatures (solid curve), our results\nsuggest that the current is indeed enhanced in the region\n\u2212U to 0 by the excess Kondo effect because the Andreevnormal co-tunneling does generate net current flow. Under what conditions can we observe the excess Kondo\nresonances? (i). When \u0393N \u2265 \u0393S , no excess Kondo peaks\ncan be obtained and only the conventional Kondo peak at\n\u03bcN emerges (inset of Fig.1b). This is because the normal\ntunneling at the N-QD interface is frequent which diminishes the virtual Andreev tunneling and the two electron fluctuation processes necessary for the excess Kondo\npeaks, as well suppresses the formation of Andreev bound\nstates. (ii). When U \u2192 \u221e, all excess Kondo peaks disappear, because at large U the timescale (lifetime) of the\nvirtual two-occupancy state, \u223c h\u0304/|U + \u01ebd \u2212 \u03bcN |, goes to\nzero thereby greatly suppressing the Andreev tunneling\n(including the virtual process). This is the qualitative\ndifference between the excess Kondo peaks discovered in\nthis work and the Kondo peaks at \u00b1\u2206 when \u2206 \u223c \u0393:\nthe latter survive the U \u2192 \u221e limit because their physi-\n\nrow peaks only exist at low temperature and they have\nthe typical character of Kondo effect: their peak heights\ngreatly depend on T and they heighten with reducing T .\nThe positions of these Kondo peaks are at \u01eb = \u03bcN , \u2212\u03bcN ,\n2\u01ebd + U \u2212 \u03bcN , and \u22122\u01ebd \u2212 U + \u03bcN . Note that two of\nthem are dependent on \u01ebd which is qualitatively different from the conventional Kondo effect. Moreover, the\nKondo peaks at \u2212\u03bcN and \u22122\u01ebd \u2212 U + \u03bcN are outside the\nKondo region of a normal system. Thus, instead of one\nKondo peak, we now have three \"excess Kondo peaks\".\nAt bias Vb = 0.7, the two Kondo peaks at 2\u01ebd + U \u2212 \u03bcN\nand \u22122\u01ebd \u2212 U + \u03bcN overlap each other, therefore only\nthree peaks are observed (see Fig.(1b)). As an extremely\nstrict confirmation of our analytical derivations and numerical\ncalculations, for all cases we have checked that\nR\nd\u01eb[LDOS(\u01eb)] = 2 which indicates that there are two\nstates in the QD.\nWhere do the excess Kondo peaks originate? They\ncertainly cannot be due to first-order tunneling processes\nbecause Andreev bound states do not align with \u03bcN . In\naddition, although direct Andreev tunneling does occur,\ntheir effect is to evolve the intradot level \u01ebd into the Andreev bound states, i.e. to give the four broad peaks in\nthe LDOS as discussed in the above. They cannot give\nrise to the Kondo effect simply because this process can\nnot flip local spin.\nOur investigation suggests that the excess Kondo peaks\noriginate from an interesting co-tunneling process not\ndiscovered before, which is indicated by Fig.(2). First,\nthe conventional Kondo peak at \u01eb = \u03bcN originates from\nthe normal co-tunneling event between the QD and the\nnormal lead depicted in Fig.(2a). Note that this process does not induce any net current. Second, the excess Kondo peak at \u01eb = \u2212\u03bcN is from a Andreev-normal\nco-tunneling process described in Fig.(2b-d). To start,\nan electron with spin-up, for example, occupies the QD\n(Fig.2b). Then a down-spin electron in the normal lead\nwith energy \u223c \u03bcN can tunnel into QD and reach the\nQD-S interface causing an Andreev reflection by which\na hole is reflected back, Fig.(2c). If \u0393N \u2265 \u0393S , this hole\ncan easily tunnel into the normal lead and neutralizes an\nup-spin electron. This is a real Andreev process in which\ntwo electrons with opposite spin in the normal lead are\nannihilated concomitant to the creation of a Cooper pair\nin the superconductor, leaving the occupancy and the\nspin of the QD unchanged. However, when \u0393S > \u0393N\nwhich is our concern, it is more difficult for this hole to\ntunnel into the normal lead, the probability is increased\nfor this hole to combine with the original up-spin electron of the QD (Fig.2c). Note that this is a virtual Andreev tunneling process: after it the system is in a highenergy virtual state which can only exist for a timescale\n\u223c h\u0304/|\u03bcN + \u01ebd |. Closely following this virtual Andreev\nprocess, another virtual process involving a normal tunneling event can occur where a down-spin electron with\nenergy \u223c \u2212\u03bcN tunnels into the QD. As consequences of\nthis virtual Andreev and virtual normal co-tunneling process, two electrons with same spin in the normal lead are\n3\n\n\fak\u03c3 , a\u2020k\u03c3 , bk\u03c3 , and b\u2020k\u03c3 ; Y is d\u03c3 and d\u2020\u03c3 .\nR d\u01eb <\nThe self-consistent\nare: n\u2191 = RIm 2\u03c0\nG11 (\u01eb),\nR d\u01eb equations\n<\nd\u01eb\n1 \u2212 n\u2193 = Im 2\u03c0 G<\n(\u01eb),\n<\nd\nd\n>=\n\u2212i\nG\n(\u01eb),\nand\n\u2193\n\u2191\n2\u03c0 12\nR d\u01eb 22<\n< d\u2020\u2191 d\u2020\u2193 >= \u2212i 2\u03c0\nG21 (\u01eb).\n16\nY.

When \u03bcN < \u01ebd , all Kondo peaks disappear and\nfour broad peaks due to Andreev bound states still exist\nas shown in Fig.(1c). Although \u2212\u03bcN is still between \u01ebd\nand \u01ebd + U , the excess Kondo peak at \u2212\u03bcN nevertheless disappears because when \u03bcN < \u01ebd , the Fermi surface\nis below \u01ebd which forbids all co-tunneling process from\nhappening.\nIn summary, for a N-QD-S device satisfying the condition \u2206 > \u0393S > \u0393N , excess Kondo peaks are predicted in\nthe local density of states which enhances the tunneling\ncurrent. These excess Kondo peaks are due to an interesting co-tunneling process involving an Andreev tunneling from the QD-S interface and a normal tunneling from\nthe N-QD interface. This new co-tunneling phenomenon\nclearly demonstrates the rich many-body physics of the\nhybrid system in which the formation of a spin singlet\nnot only can be due to the many free electrons, but also\ncan be due to a combined effect of free electrons and the\nmany Cooper pairs in the superconducting lead.\nAcknowledgments: We gratefully acknowledge financial support from NSERC of Canada, FCAR of Quebec (Q.S., H.G), and NSF of China (T.L.).\n\n15\n\nFIG. 1.\n(a) LDOS vs \u01eb at different U for a high temperature T = 0.5, with parameters Vb = 0, \u0393N = 0.1.
