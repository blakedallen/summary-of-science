While this approach has a potential of generating highly organized\nand sophisticated structures([7],[8]), most of the studies report random aggregation of colloidal particles([9],[10]).\nDespite these shortcomings, the aggregation and melting properties may provide important information for future\ndevelopment of DNA-based self\u2013assembly techniques. These results also have more immediate implications. For\ninstance, the observed sharp melting transition is of particular interest for biosensor applications [11]. For these\nreasons the development of a statistical mechanical description of these types of systems is of great importance. It\nshould be noted that the previous models of aggregation in colloidal-DNA systems were either phenomenological or\noversimplified lattice models([12],[13],[14]), which gave only limited insight into the physics of the phenomena.\nIn this paper, we develop a theory of reversible aggregation and melting in colloidal-DNA systems, starting from\nthe known thermodynamic parameters of DNA (i.e. hybridization free energy \u2206G), and geometric properties of\nDNA-particle complexes. The output of our theory is the relative abundance of the various colloidal structures\nformed (dimers, trimers, etc.) as a function of temperature, as well as the temperature at which a transition to an\ninfinite aggregate occurs. The theory provides a direct link between DNA microscopics and experimentally observed\nmorphological and thermal properties of the system. It should be noted that the hybridization free energy \u2206G\ndepends not only on the DNA nucleotide sequence, but also on the salt concentration and the concentration of DNA\nlinker strands tethered on the particle surface[15]. In this paper \u2206G values refer to hybridization between DNA free\nin solution.\nIn a generic experimental setup, particles are grafted with DNA linker sequences which determine the particle\ntype(A or B). In this paper we will restrict our attention to a binary system1 . These linkers may be flexible or\nrigid. A selective, attractive potential between particles of type A and B can then be turned on by joining the linkers\nto form a DNA bridge. This DNA bridge can be constructed directly if the particle linker sequences are chosen to\nhave complementary ends. Alternatively, the DNA bridge can be constructed with the help of an additional linker\nDNA. This additional linker is designed to have one end sequence complementary to the linker sequence of type A\nparticles, and the other end complementary to type B. The properties of the DNA bridge formed will depend on the\nhybridization scheme(see figure 1).\nThe plan for the paper is as follows. In section II.A we provide a description of the problem. In section II.B\nwe determine the bridging probability for the formation of a DNA bridge between two colloids, assuming the known\nthermodynamic parameters of DNA(hybridization free energy \u2206G). Using this bridging probability as input, in\nsection II.C we calculate the effective binding free energy \u01ebAB for the formation of a dimer. Sections III.A-III.C\nestablish the connection between the theory and the experimentally determined melting profile f (T ), the fraction of\n\n1\n\nThis restriction to binary systems is consistent with the current experimental approach. In a recent work we demonstrated that if each\nparticle has a unique linker sequence, one might be able to programmably self-assemble nanoparticle clusters of desired geometry[8].\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: (Color Online) Graphical depiction of various schemes for DNA bridging.

C) A rigid bridge\nconstructed from short, flexible linker DNA and a long, rigid linker.\n\nunbound particles as a function of temperature. In particular, we demonstrate how knowledge of \u01ebAB can be used to\ndetermine this profile, including the effects of particle aggregation. In Section III.D the theory is compared with two\nrecent experiments detailing the reversible aggregation of colloids with DNA-mediated attraction[12],[9]. The main\nresults of the model are summarized in section IV.\nII.\n\nDNA-MEDIATED INTERACTIONS\nA.\n\nDescription of the problem\n\nWe consider particles of type A and B which form reversible AB bonds as a result of DNA hybridization. The\ntask at hand is to determine the relative abundance of the various colloidal structures that form as a function of\ntemperature. From this information we can determine which factors affect the melting and aggregation properties in\nDNA-colloidal assemblies. To do so we must determine the binding free energy for all of the possible phases(monomer,\ndimer, ..., infinite aggregate), and then apply the rules for thermodynamic equilibrium. As we will see in section III,\nthese binding free energies can all be simply related to \u01ebAB , the binding free energy for the formation of a dimer. Our\ntask is thus reduced to determining \u01ebAB from the thermodynamic parameters of DNA and structural properties of the\nDNA linkers. In our statistical mechanical framework, \u01ebAB is calculated from the model partition function, taking\ninto account the appropriate ensemble averaging for the non-ergodic degrees of freedom. The result is related to the\nbridging probability for a pair of linkers. By considering the specific properties of the DNA bridge that forms, the\nbridging probability can be related to the hybridization free energy \u2206G of the DNA. In this way, we obtain a direct\nlink between DNA thermodynamics and the global aggregation and melting properties in colloidal-DNA systems.\nB.\n\nBridging probability\n\nTo begin we relate the hybridization free energy \u2206G for the DNA in solution to the bridging probability for a pair\nof linkers. This bridging probability is defined as the ratio PPbound\n, with Pbound the probability that the pair of linkers\nf ree\nhave hybridized to form a DNA bridge, and Pf ree the probability that they are unbound. This ratio is directly\ne (throughout this paper we\nrelated to the free energy difference of the bound and unbound states of the linkers \u2206G\n\n\f3\nwill use units with kB = 1):\n#\n\"\n\u0015\n\u0014\ne\ncef f\n\u2212\u2206G\n\u2212\u2206G\nPbound\n=\n= exp\nexp\nPf ree\nT\nco\nT\nR\nP (r1 , r)P (r2 , r)d3 r\ncef f =\nR\n\u00012\nP (r, r\u2032 )d3 r\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nHere co = 1M is a reference concentration. P (r, r\u2032 ) is the probability distribution function for the linker chain which\nstarts at r\u2032 and ends at r. The effective concentration cef f is a measure of the change in conformational entropy\nof the linker DNA as a result of hybridization. It will depend on the properties of the linker DNA(ex: flexible vs.\nrigid), and the scheme for DNA bridging(ex: hybridization of complementary ends vs. hybridization mediated by an\nadditional linker). cef f is the concentration of free DNA which would have the same hybridization probability as the\ngrafted linkers in our problem. As discussed in section III.D, the DNA linker grafting density also plays an important\nrole in determining the possible linker configurations and hence cef f .\nAssuming that the size of the linkers is much smaller than the particle radius R, we first consider the problem\nin a planar geometry. Let the two linkers be attached to two parallel planar surfaces separated by a distance 2h.\nReferring to figure 2 we see that r\u2032 is the location where the linker DNA is grafted onto the particle surface, and r is\nthe position of the free end.\n\nFIG. 2: (Color Online) The statistical weight of a bound state is calculated by determining the number of hybridized configurations for two complementary linker chains relative to the number of unhybridized configurations.\n\nIn this paper we consider hybridization by complementary, rigid linker DNA (scheme A in Figure 1). This scheme\nis particularly interesting since it is directly related to several recent experiments [9],[12]. In a future work we will\naddress other hybridization schemes. We assume that L < Lp and L \u226a R, where Lp \u2243 50nm is the persistence\nlength of ds DNA and L is the ds linker DNA length. In this regime, the linker chains can be treated as rigid rods\ntethered on a planar surface. The interaction is assumed to be point-like, in which a small fraction \u2206/L of the linker\nbases hybridize.\nWe can calculate the effective concentration by noting that the overlap integral in Eq. (2) is proportional to the\nvolume of intersection of two spherical shells (red and blue circles in Figure 3) :\ncef f =\n\n2\u03c0rA\n2\n\n(2\u03c0L2 \u2206)\n\n=\n\n\u0398 (L \u2212 |r\u20321 \u2212 r\u20322 | /2)\n,\n2\u03c0 2 L2 |r\u20321 \u2212 r\u20322 |\n\n(3)\n\nq\n2\nhere A = \u2206 / sin \u03b2 and r = L2 \u2212 |r\u20321 \u2212 r\u20322 | /4 (see notations in Figure 3). We have used the fact that cos \u03b2/2 =\n|r\u20321 \u2212 r\u20322 | /2L. cef f and the binding probability are largest when the linkers are grafted right in front of each other,\n2\n\n\f4\ni.e. when |r\u20321 \u2212 r\u20322 | \u223c 2h. By taking the limit h \u2248 L we arrive at the following result for the corresponding \"bridging\"\nfree energy\n\u0003\n\u0002\ne A \u2248 \u2206GA + T log 4\u03c0L3 co .\n(4)\n\u2206G\n\nThis free energy remains nearly constant for any pair of linkers, as long as they can\n\u221a be connected in principle, i.e.\n|r\u20321 \u2212 r\u20322 | < 2L. This limits the maximum lateral displacement of the linkers: r\u22a5 < 2 L2 \u2212 h2 , and therefore sets the\neffective cross-section of the interaction:\n\u0001\n2\na = \u03c0r\u22a5\n= 4\u03c0 L2 \u2212 h2\n(5)\n\nFIG. 3: (Color Online) Cross-sectional view of the hybridization of two complementary rigid linker DNA. The effective\nconcentration is calculated in a planar approximation to the particle surface.\n\nC.\n\nEffective binding free energy\n\nWe now proceed with the calculation of the effective free energy \u01ebAB , which is associated with the formation\nof a dimer from a pair of free particles, A and B. Since the DNA coverage on the particle surface is not uniform,\nthis free energy, and the corresponding partition function Z, would in principle depend on the orientations of the\nparticles with respect to the line connecting their centers. The equilibrium binding free energy would correspond to\nthe canonical ensemble of all possible orientations, i.e. \u01ebAB = \u2212T log 4\u03c0 hZi. However, this equilibrium can only be\nachieved after a very long time, when the particle pair samples all possible binding configurations, or at least their\nrepresentative subset. The real situation is different. After the first DNA-mediated bridge is created the particle\npair can still explore the configurational space by rotating about this contact point. However, after the formation of\ntwo or more DNA bridges (at certain relative orientation of the particles), the further exploration requires multiple\nbreaking and reconnecting of the DNA links, which is a very slow process. We conclude that the system is ergodic\nwith respect to the various conformations of the linker DNA for fixed orientations of the particles, but the orientations\nthemselves are non-ergodic variables. The only exceptions are the single-bridge states: the system quickly relaxes to\na more favorable orientational state (unless the DNA coverage is extremely low, and finding a second contact is very\nhard). If N denotes the number of DNA bridges constituting the AB bond, the appropriate expression for \u01ebAB in\nthis partially ergodic regime is the so-called component averaged free energy([16],[17]):\n\u01ebAB = \u2212T hlog ZiN \u22652\n\n(6)\n\n\f5\nEach DNA bridge between particles can be either open or closed.\nZbridge\n\ne \u2032 , r\u20321 \u2212 r\u20322 )\n\u2206G(h\n= 1 + exp \u2212\nT\n\n!\n\n(7)\n\nHere r\u2032i is the 2D position where the bridge is grafted onto surface i.

In this section of the paper we establish the\nconnection between that result and the experimentally observable morphological behavior of a large system. One of\nthe ways to characterize the system is to study its melting profile f (T ), which is the fraction of unbound particles\nas a function of temperature. To determine the profile we calculate the chemical potential for each phase(monomer,\ndimer, etc.) and apply the thermodynamic rules for phase equilibrium. We will demonstrate how the single binding\nfree energy \u01ebAB can be used to determine the contribution of each phase to the melting profile, including the effects\nof aggregation.\nA.\n\nDimer formation\n\nTo begin we discuss the formation of dimers via the reaction A + B \u21cb AB. We can express the chemical potential\nof the ith species \u03bci in terms of the particle concentrations ci = NVi .\n\u03bcA = T log (cA )\n\u03bcB = T log (cB )\n\u03bcAB = T log (cAB ) + \u01ebAB\n\n(21)\n(22)\n(23)\n\nHere \u01ebAB is the binding free energy for the formation of a dimer. In terms of the potential V (r) between A and B\ntype particles we have:\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\nZ\nV (r)\n2\n\u01ebAB = \u2212T log 4\u03c0(2R) co dr exp \u2212\n(24)\nT\n\n\f7\nIn this section we are not particularly concerned with the specific form of the DNA-induced potential V (r), having\nalready determined \u01ebAB in the previous section. We simply note that the prefactor 4\u03c0(2R)2 arises since the interaction\nis assumed to be isotropic, with R the particle radius. Equilibrating the chemical potential of the various particle\nspecies, we obtain the condition for chemical equilibrium.\n\u03bcA + \u03bcB = \u03bcAB\n\n(25)\n\nThe result is a relationship between the concentration of dimers and monomers.\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u2212\u01ebAB\ncA cB\nexp\ncAB =\nco\nT\n\n(26)\n\nThe overall concentration of particles in monomers and dimers must not differ from the initial concentration.\nciA = cA + cAB\n\n(27)\n\nciB\n\n(28)\n\n= cB + cAB\n\nIf the system is prepared at equal concentration, ciA = ciB = 12 ctot , subtracting the two equations we see that\ncA = cB \u2261 c.

The chemical potential is slightly different in this\ncase.\n\u03bcABA = T log (cABA ) + \u01ebABA\n\n(32)\n\nTaking into account that there are now two AB bonds in the structure, one might conclude that \u01ebABA = 2\u01ebAB . This\nis not quite correct, since there is a reduction in solid angle available to the third particle. To form a trimer, an AB\nbond forms first, which contributes \u01ebAB to \u01ebABA . Some simple geometry shows that the remaining A particle only\nhas 3\u03c0 steradians of possible bonding sites to particle\nB. Making this change in the prefactor of eq. 24, one can see\n\u0001\nthat the second bond contributes \u01ebAB \u2212 T log 43 to \u01ebABA .\n\u0012 \u0013\n3\n(33)\n\u01ebABA = 2\u01ebAB \u2212 T log\n4\nThe equation for chemical equilibrium can once again be expressed in terms of the particle concentrations.\n2\u03bcA + \u03bcB = \u03bcABA\ncABA =\n\n3\n4\n\nc2A cB\nc2o\n\nexp\n\n\u0014\n\n\u22122\u01ebAB\nT\n\n\u0015\n\n(34)\n(35)\n\n\f8\nTo include the trimer contribution, we note that there are two possible varieties, with \u01ebABA = \u01ebBAB .\nciA = cA + cAB + 2cABA + cBAB\n\n(36)\n\nciB\n\n(37)\n\n= cB + cAB + cABA + 2cBAB\n\nFollowing the same line of reasoning as before, the resulting equation for the unbound fraction f is:\n\u0015\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0014\n9\n\u22122e\u01ebAB 3\n\u2212e\u01ebAB\nf 2 + exp\nf\n1 = f + exp\nT\n4\nT\n\n(38)\n\nFor tetramers we will follow the same general reasoning, however in this case there are two different structure types.\nThe reaction 2A + 2B \u21cb ABAB results in the formation of string like structures.\n\u03bcABAB = T log (cABAB ) + \u01ebABAB\n\n(39)\n\u0001\nAs in the trimer case, the last particle has 3\u03c0 steradians of possible bonding sites, and contributes \u01ebAB \u2212 T log 34 to\n\u01ebABAB .\n\"\u0012 \u0013 #\n2\n3\n(40)\n\u01ebABAB = 3\u01ebAB \u2212 T log\n4\n2\u03bcA + 2\u03bcB = \u03bcABAB\n\u0012 \u00132 2 2\n\u0015\n\u0014\n3\ncA cB\n\u22123\u01ebAB\ncABAB =\nexp\n4\nc3o\nT\n\n(41)\n(42)\n\nIf an A type particle approaches a trimer of variety ABA, a branched structure can result.

The fraction of particles in dimers, trimers, and tetramers is also plotted.\nC.\n\nReversible sol-gel transition\n\nTo understand the basic structure of the aggregate, we simply note that there are many DNA attached to each\nparticle. This gives rise to branching, as in the discussion of possible tetramer structures. Since the DNA which\nmediate the interaction are grafted onto the particle surface, once two particles are bound, the relative orientation of\nthe pair is essentially fixed. The resulting aggregate is a tree-like structure, and the transition to an infinite aggregate\nat low temperatures is analogous to the sol-gel transition in branched polymers[19].\nParticles in the aggregate are pinned down by their nearest neighbor bonds, so we do not consider their translational\nentropy. As a result the chemical potential is simply \u03bc\u221e = \u01eb\u221e . Equilibrating the chemical potential of the monomer\nin solution and in the aggregate we have:\nT log (c) = \u01eb\u221e\n\u01eb\u221e = \u01ebAB \u2212 T log (\u03b3 \u221e )\n\n(50)\n(51)\n\nHere \u03b3 \u221e \u2243 1 is the configurational entropy of the branched aggregate, per particle.\nThe concentration of particles in the aggregate c\u221e is the the total concentration minus the n-mer concentration.\nHere c1 = cA + cB is the total monomer concentration, c2 = cAB is the total dimer concentration, etc.\nc\u221e \u2248 ctot \u2212 c1 \u2212 c2 \u2212 c3 \u2212 c4\nExpressed in terms of e\u01ebAB and the fraction of solid angle available to particles in the aggregate \u03b3 \u221e =\n\u0015\n\u0014\ne\u01ebAB\n1\nexp\nf\u221e =\n\u03b3\u221e\nT\n\n(52)\n\u03a9\u221e\n4\u03c0\n\nwe have:\n(53)\n\nThe transition from dimers, trimers, etc. to the aggregation behavior is the temperature T \u2217 at which f\u221e (T \u2217 ) is a\nsolution to eq. 49. In words, T \u2217 is the temperature at which the aggregate has a non-zero volume fraction. The\nfraction of unbound particles for these colloidal assemblies will be governed by eq. 53 for T < T \u2217 and eq. 49 for\nT > T \u2217 . As claimed, we can simply relate the unbound fraction to e\u01ebAB for both n-mers and the aggregate.\nD.\n\nComparison to the experiment\n\nLet's consider the experimental scheme of Chaikin et al[9]. In the experiment, R = .5\u03bcm polystyrene beads were\ngrafted with ds DNA linkers of length L \u2243 20nm. The 11 end bases of the A and B type particles were single stranded\n\n\f10\nand complementary. We have already determined the bridging probability in this scenario(see section II.B). In the\nexperiment[9] a polymer brush is also grafted onto the particle surface, which will have the effect of preferentially\norienting the rods normal to the surface(See Figure 3). This confinement of the linker DNA can be incorporated\ne and hN i. Returning to section II.B, when integrating over linker conformations\nquite easily into our results for \u2206G\nwe simply confine each rigid rod to a cone of opening angle 2\u03b1. The upper bound for the polar integration is now \u03b1\nas opposed to \u03c0.\n\u0003\n\u0002\ne A \u2243 \u2206GA + T log 4\u03c0L3 co (1 \u2212 cos \u03b1)2\n(54)\n\u2206G\n\nThe alignment effect should also be taken into account when calculating hN i. If the particles are separated by less\nthan \u20322L cos \u03b1 the end sequences will be unable to hybridize. Following the same steps as before, the lower bound for\nthe h integration is now L cos \u03b1 as opposed to 0.\nZ L\n\u2032\n\u2032\n(L2 \u2212 h 2 )dh\n(55)\nhN i = 8\u03c0 2 \u03c3 2 R\nL cos \u03b1\n\nh\ni\n16 2 2\ncos \u03b1\n=\n\u03c0 \u03c3 RL3 1 +\n(cos2 \u03b1 \u2212 3)\n3\n2\n\n(56)\n\nIn the absence of the brush, and at sufficiently low linker grafting density \u03c3, the alignment effect could be removed\nby setting \u03b1 = \u03c02 , in which case we recover our previous results. Since the polymer brush is stiff, it also imposes a\nminimum separation of 2h between particles, where h is the height of the brush. As a result, in the expression for\n\u01ebAB we can approximate the radial flexibility of the AB bond as \u03b4 \u2243 L \u2212 h.\n1\n0.9\n\nSinglet beads fraction\n\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\nTemperature(oC)\n\nFIG. 5: (Color Online) Comparison of the melting curves f (T ) determined by our model to the experimental data of Chaikin\net al(See Fig.2 in [9]).

The height of the polymer brush is h = 13 \u00b1 5nm[9]. In\nfitting the experimental data we have taken the average value hhi = 13nm. Changing h within these bounds does\nnot have a major effect on the melting curves. As a result there is one free parameter in the model, the confinement\ne which in turn determine e\u01ebAB , and finally the melting profile f .\nangle \u03b1. This angle determines hN i and \u2206G,\nWith some minor modifications we can also analyze the \"tail to tail\" hybridization mode in a recent experiment\nof Mirkin et al[12]. In this experiment, R = 6.5nm gold nanoparticles were chemically functionalized with ss DNA\nlinkers. The last 15 bases on the markers for particles of type A and B were chosen to be complementary to a 30\nbase ss DNA linker.

This experiment is done without the addition of a\npolymer brush, but the grafting density is two orders of magnitude larger than the experiment of Chaikin et al. As\na result, there is still an entropic repulsion[7] associated with compressing the particles below separation 2h.

This highlights some incorrect assumptions\nof the thermodynamic melting model[12], where the two hybridization free energies were not calculated separately,\nand the translational entropy of the additional linker DNA was ignored. By introducing dilutent strands to the\nsystem, one can probe the effect of the linker grafting density \u03c3 on the melting properties of the assembly(See Figure\n2B in [12]). The agreement between the experimental data and our theory is good, except at small f values. This\nis not surprising, since comparing the two requires relating the measurement of optical extinction to the unbound\nfraction f . This is a nontrivial matter when dealing with aggregation, which corresponds to the small f regime.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have developed a statistical mechanical description of aggregation and melting in DNA-mediated colloidal\nsystems. First we obtained a general result for two-particle binding energy in terms of DNA hybridization free\nenergy \u2206G, and two model\u2013dependent parameters: the average number of available bridges hN i and the effective\nDNA concentration cef f . We have also shown how these parameters can be calculated for a particular bridging\nscheme. In our discussion we have explicitly taken into account the partial ergodicity of the problem related to slow\nbinding-unbinding dynamics.\n\n\f12\nIn the second part of the paper it was demonstrated that the fractions of dimers, trimers and other clusters,\nincluding the infinite aggregate, are universal functions of a parameter e\u01ebAB /T = \u01ebAB /T \u2212 log [ctot /2c0 ]. We have\napplied the results of our theory to a particular scheme when the DNA bridge is made of two freely jointed rods (ds\nDNA). The obtained melting curves are in excellent agreement with two types of experiments, done with particles\nof nanometer and micron sizes. Furthermore, our analysis of the experimental data give an additional insight into\nmicroscopic physics of DNA bridging in these systems: it was shown that the experiments cannot be explained\nwithout introduction of angular localization of linker ds DNA. The corresponding localization angle \u03b1 is the only\nfitting parameter of the model, which allows one to fit both the position and width of the observed melting curves.\nThere are several manifestations of the greater predictive power of our statistical mechanics approach, compared to\nthe earlier more phenomenological models. First, once \u03b1 is determined for a particular system, our theory allows one\nto calculate the melting behavior for an alternative choice of DNA linker sequences. Second, if the resulting clusters\nare separated, for example in a density gradient tube, the relative abundance of dimers, trimers, and tetramers can\nbe compared to the values determined from the theory.\nFinally, the theory predicts aging of the colloidal structures, one experimental signature for which is hysteresis\nof the melting curves. Such an experiment proceeds by preparing a system above the melting temperature, and\nmeasuring the unbound fraction of colloids as the temperature is lowered. The system is allowed to remain in this\ncooled state for a very long time, perhaps months, during which multiple DNA bridges break and reform. During\nthis time the colloids relax into a more favorable orientation state, including states which are not accessible by simply\nrotating about the contact point formed by the first DNA bridge between particles. This favorable orientation state\nis characterized by an average number of DNA bridges hN i greater than what we calculate in the partially ergodic\nregime. If the unbound fraction is then measured as the temperature is increased, the melting curve will shift to a\nhigher temperature, consistent with a larger value of hN i.\nV.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis work was supported by the ACS Petroleum Research Fund (grant PRF #44181-AC10), and by the Michigan\nCenter for Theoretical Physics (award # MCTP 06-03).\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n\nMirkin, C.
