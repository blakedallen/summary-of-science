Helicity measures complexity in the field. Magnetic helicity is given by a volume\nintegral over the scalar product of magnetic field B and its vector potential A.

This indicates a long term\nbehaviour of the hemispheric helicity patterns in the Sun. The above sums up my PhD thesis.\nKeywords. Sun: atmosphere, Sun: magnetic fields, Sun: sunspots\n\n1. Introduction\nMagnetic helicity is a physical quantity that measures the degree of linkage and twistedness in the magnetic field lines (Moffatt 1978). It is given as\nZ\nHm = A * B dV\n(1.1)\nThe term magnetic helicity was introduced by Elsasser (1956) and many of its important\ncharacteristics were studied by Woltjer (1958); Taylor (1974); Berger & Field (1984) etc.\nThe handedness associated with the field is defined by 'chirality'. Helicity is closely\nrelated to chirality. If the twist on the surface is clockwise, the chirality is negative and\nthe field bears dextral chirality. The sunspot twist direction is decided by the curvature\nof sunspot whirls (Martin 1998; Tiwari 2009). If the twist is counterclockwise (when we\ngo from sunspot center towards outside), the chirality is sinistral and sign of helicity is\npositive. Reverse is true for the dextral chirality. These definitions of chirality have been\nused to study the hemispheric patterns of the active regions (Tiwari et al. 2008, 2010b).\nOne of the main motivations of the thesis (Tiwari 2009) was to use the helicity or related\nparameters to help in predicting the severity of the solar flares. If done so, this would\ncontribute in improving the space-weather forecasting. We have found the parameter\nsigned shear angle (SSA) to be very useful in this context (Tiwari et al. 2010a).\nSome of the important results of my Ph.D. thesis are summarized very briefly in the\nfollowing sections.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nSanjiv Kumar Tiwari\n\n2. Estimating magnetic parameters\nPhysical meaning of \u03b1. We arrive at the following depiction of \u03b1 (for details, please\nsee Appendix A of Tiwari et al. (2009a)):\n\u03b1=2\n\nd\u03c6\ndz\n\n(2.1)\n\nFrom Equation 2.1, it is clear that the \u03b1 gives twice the degree of twist per unit axial\nlength. If we take one complete rotation of flux tube i.e., \u03c6 = 2\u03c0, and loop length \u03bb \u2248 109\nmeters, then\n2 \u00d7 2\u03c0\n\u03b1=\n(2.2)\n\u03bb\ncomes out to be of the order of 10\u22128 per meter.\nCorrelation between sign of Hm and that of \u03b1. Vector potential in terms of scalar potential \u03c6 can be expressed as (for details, please see Appendix B of Tiwari et al. (2009a))\nA = B\u03b1\u22121 + \u2207\u03c6\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhich is valid only for constant \u03b1. Using this relation in Equation 1, we get magnetic\nhelicity as\nZ\nHm = (B\u03b1\u22121 + \u2207\u03c6) * B dV\nZ\nZ\nZ\n= B 2 \u03b1\u22121 dV + (B * \u2207)\u03c6 dV \u223c ( (\u03c6 B) * n dS)\n(2.4)\nshowing that the force free parameter \u03b1 has the same sign as that of the magnetic helicity\niff n * B = 0 i.e., no field lines cross the boundary, which is not the case with the Sun.\nA direct method for calculating global \u03b1. We prefer to use the second moment of minimization (Tiwari et al. 2009a) leading to the following expression:\nP \u2202By\nx\n)Bz\n( \u2202x \u2212 \u2202B\nP 2\u2202y\n\u03b1g =\n.\n(2.5)\nBz\n(2)\n\nThis formula gives a single global value of \u03b1 in a sunspot and is the similar to \u03b1av of\nHagino & Sakurai (2004). We do not use direct mean (0th order moment) as it leads\nto singularities at neutral lines where Bz \u223c 0. First order moment will also lead to\nsingularities when flux is balanced.\nEstimating the effect of polarimetric noise in the measurement of field parameters. Using the analytical bipole method (Low 1982), non-potential force-free field components\nBx , By & Bz in a plane have been generated. We calculate the synthetic Stokes profiles\nfor each B, \u03b3 and \u03be in a grid of 100 x 100 pixels, using the He-Line Information Extractor \"HELIX\" code (Lagg et al. 2004). We add random noise of 0.5 % of the continuum\nintensity Ic (Ichimoto et al. 2008) to the polarimetric profiles as observed in SOT/SP\naboard Hinode. In addition, we also study the effect of adding a noise of 2.0% level to\nStokes profiles as a worst case scenario. We add 100 realizations of the noise of the orders\nmentioned above to each pixel and invert the corresponding 100 noisy profiles using the\n\"HELIX\" code. The effect of polarimetric noise in the derivation of vector fields and\nother parameters such as \u03b1g and magnetic energy is found to be very small. We have\ndone similar investigations as a second step using real data (Gosain et al. 2010). As a\nthird step we plan to use MHD simulated data to check the inversion codes including the\neffect of optical depth corrugation.\n\n\fHelicity of the solar magnetic field\n\n3\n\n3. Global twist of sunspot magnetic fields\nIntroduction of signed shear angle (SSA). To emphasize the sign of shear angle we introduce the signed shear angle (SSA) for the sunspots as follows: choose an initial reference azimuth for a current-free field (obtained from the observed line of sight field).\nThen move to the observed field azimuth from the reference azimuth through an acute\nangle. If this rotation is counter-clockwise, then assign a positive sign for the SSA. A\nnegative sign is given for clockwise rotation. This sign convention will be consistent with\nthe sense of azimuthal field produced by a vertical current. This sign convention is also\nconsistent with the sense of chirality (Tiwari et al. 2009b). The SSA is computed from\nthe following formula (Tiwari et al. 2010a):\nSSA = tan\u22121 (\n\nByo Bxp \u2212 Byp Bxo\n)\nBxo Bxp + Byo Byp\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere Bxo , Byo and Bxp , Byp are observed and potential transverse components of sunspot\nmagnetic fields respectively. A spatial average of the SSA (SASSA) gives the global twist\nof sunspot magnetic fields at observed height irrespective of the force-free nature of the\nfield and shape of sunspots (Venkatakrishnan & Tiwari 2009).\nFine structures in terms of Jz and \u03b1. Local Jz and \u03b1 patches of opposite signs are\npresent in the umbra of each sunspot. The amplitude of the spatial variation of local\n\u03b1 in the umbra is typically of the order of the global \u03b1 of the sunspot. We find that\nthe local \u03b1 is distributed as alternately positive and negative filaments in the penumbra.\nThe amplitude of azimuthal variation of the local \u03b1 in the penumbra is approximately\nan order of magnitude larger than that in the umbra. The contributions of the local\npositive and negative currents and \u03b1 in the penumbra cancel each other giving almost\nno contribution for their global values for whole sunspot. The data sets used in the\nanalysis are taken from ASP/DLSP and Hinode (SOT/SP). See for details: Tiwari et al.\n(2009b). Most of the data sets we studied are observed during the declining minimum\nphase of solar cycle 23. All except 5, out of 43 sunspots observed, follow the reverse twist\nhemispheric rule, while 5 follow the conventional helicity rule. Also, \u03b1g has same sign as\nthe SASSA and therefore the same sign of the photospheric chirality of the sunspots, but\nthe magnitudes of SASSA and \u03b1g are not well correlated. This lack of correlation could\nbe due to a variety of reasons: (a) departure from the force-free nature (b) even for the\nforce-free fields, \u03b1 is the gradient of twist variation whereas SASSA is purely an angle.\nThe missing link is the scale length of variation of twist.\n\n4. Net current in sunspots\nExpression for net current. We consider a long straight flux bundle surrounded by a\nregion of \"field free\" plasma following Parker (1996). Parker (1996) assumed azimuthal\nsymmetry as well as zero radial component Br , of the magnetic field. For realistic sunspot\nfields, we have already seen the ubiquitous fine structure of the radial magnetic field.\nHence, we need to relax both these assumptions.\nThe vertical component of the electric current density consists of two terms, viz.\n\u2202(rB )\nr\n\u2212 \u03bc10 r \u2202B\nand \u03bc10 r \u2202r \u03c8 . We will call the first term as the \"pleat current density\",\n\u2202\u03c8\njp and the second term as the \"twist current density\", jt . The total current Iz within a\ndistance \u031f from the center is then given by\nZ 2\u03c0\nZ \u031f\nIz (\u031f) =\nd\u03c8\nrdr(jp + jt )\n(4.1)\n0\n\n0\n\n\f4\n\nSanjiv Kumar Tiwari\n\nThe \u03c8 integral over jp vanishes, while the second term yields\nZ\n\u031f 2\u03c0\nIz (\u031f) =\nd\u03c8B\u03c8 (\u031f, \u03c8)\n\u03bc0 0\n\n(4.2)\n\nwhich gives the net currents within a circular region of radius \u031f. The transverse vector\ncan be expressed in cylindrical geometry as\nBr =\n\n1\n(xBx + yBy )\nr\n\n(4.3)\n\n1\n(\u2212yBx + xBy )\n(4.4)\nr\nThe azimuthal field B\u03c8 is then used in Equation 4.2 for obtaining the value for the total\nvertical current within a radius \u031f.\nNo net current: an evidence for fibril bundle nature of sunspot magnetic field? As expected from the trend in Figure 3 of Venkatakrishnan & Tiwari (2009), the net current\nshows evidence for a rapid decline after reaching a maximum. Similar trends were seen\nin other sunspots. This can be interpreted as evidence for the neutralization of the net\ncurrent. Table 1 of Venkatakrishnan & Tiwari (2009) shows the summary of results for\nall the sunspots analyzed. Along with the power law index \u03b4 of B\u03c8 decrease, we have\nalso shown the average deviation of the azimuth from the radial direction (\"twist angle = tan\u22121 (B\u03c8 /Br )\"), as well as the SASSA. The average deviation of the azimuth is\nwell correlated with the SASSA for nearly circular sunspots, but is not correlated with\nSASSA for more irregularly shaped sunspots. Thus, SASSA is a more general measure\nof the global twist of sunspots, irrespective of their shape.\nAs is well known for astrophysical plasmas, that the plasma distorts the magnetic field\nand the curl of this distorted field produces a current by Ampere's law (Parker 1979).\nParker's (1996) expectation of net zero current in a sunspot was basically motivated by\nthe concept of a fibril structure for the sunspot field. However, he also did not rule out the\npossibility of vanishing net current for a monolithic field where the azimuthal component\nof the vector field in a cylindrical geometry declines faster than 1/\u031f. While it is difficult\nto detect fibrils using the Zeeman effect, notwithstanding the superior resolution of SOT\non Hinode, the stability and accuracy of the measurements have allowed us to detect the\nfaster than 1/\u031f decline of the azimuthal component of the magnetic field, which in turn\ncan be construed as evidence for the confinement of the sunspot field by the external\nplasma. The resulting pattern of curl B appears as a sharp decline in the net current\nat the sunspot boundary. Although the existence of a global twist in the absence of a\nnet current is possible for a monolithic sunspot field (Baty 2000), a fibril model of the\nsunspot field can accommodate a global twist even without a net current (Parker 1996).\nA sunspot, made up of a bundle of magnetically isolated current free fibrils, can be given\nan overall torsion without inducing a global current. For details and more discussions\nplease see Venkatakrishnan & Tiwari (2009); Tiwari (2009, 2010).\nB\u03c8 =\n\n5. Relationship between the SASSA of active regions and associated\nGOES X-ray flux\nWe find an upper limit of peak X-ray flux for a given value of SASSA can be given for\ndifferent classes of X-ray flares. Figures 5(a) and 5(b) of Tiwari et al. (2010a) represent\nscatter plots between the peak GOES X-ray flux and interpolated SASSA and mean\nweighted shear angle (MWSA: Wang (1992)) values for that time, respectively. The cubic\nspline interpolation of the sample of the SASSA and the MWSA values has been done\n\n\fHelicity of the solar magnetic field\n\n5\n\nto get the SASSA and MWSA exactly at the time of peak flux of the X-ray flare. For\ndetails kindly see Tiwari et al. (2010a). We find that the SASSA, apart from its helicity\nsign related studies, can also be used to predict the severity of the solar flares. However\nto establish these lower limits of SASSA for different classes of X-ray flares, we need\nmore cases to study. The SASSA already gives a good indication of its utility from the\npresent four case studies using 115 vector magnetograms from Hinode (SOT/SP). Once\nthe vector magnetograms are routinely available with higher cadence, the lower limit of\nSASSA for each class of X-ray flare can be established by calculating the SASSA in a\nseries of vector magnetograms. This will provide the inputs to space weather models.\nAlso, SASSA has shown a good correlation with the free magnetic energy computed by\nJing et al. (2010).\nThe other non-potentiality parameter MWSA studied in Tiwari et al. (2010a) does\nshow a similar trend as that of the SASSA. The magnitudes of MWSA, however, do not\nshow consistent threshold values as related with the peak GOES X-ray flux of different\nclasses of solar flares. One possible reason for this behavior may be explained as follows:\nThe MWSA weights the strong transverse fields e.g., penumbral fields. From the recent\nstudies (Su et al. 2009; Tiwari et al. 2009b; Tiwari 2009; Venkatakrishnan & Tiwari 2009,\n2010) it is clear that the penumbral field contains complicated structures with opposite\nsigns of vertical current and vertical component of the magnetic tension forces. Although\nthe amplitudes of the magnetic parameters are found high in the penumbra, they do\nnot contribute to their global values because they contain opposite signs, which cancel\nout in the averaging process (Tiwari 2009; Tiwari et al. 2009b). On the other hand, the\nMWSA adds those high values of shear and produces a pedestal that might mask any\nthe relation between the more relevant global non-potentiality and the peak X-ray flux.\nWhereas the SASSA perhaps gives more relevant value of the shear after cancelation of\nthe penumbral contribution.\n\n6. Solar cycle dependence\nHelicity hemispheric rule. We compare the behaviour of magnetic helicity sign of AR's\nobserved in the beginning of 24th solar cycle with some AR's observed in the declining\nphase of 23rd solar cycle. We find that the majority of active regions in the beginning\nof solar cycle 24 do follow the hemispheric helicity rule whereas those observed in the\ndeclining phase of solar cycle 23 do not (Tiwari, 2009; Tiwari et al., 2010c, in prep.).\nSign of magnetic helicity at different heights in the solar atmosphere. A good correlation has been found among the sign of helicity in the associated features observed at\nphotospheric, chromospheric and coronal heights without solar cycle dependence (Tiwari\net al. 2008; Tiwari, 2009; Tiwari et al. 2010b; Tiwari et al., 2010c, in prep.).\n\n7. Conclusions\nThe magnetic field parameters can be derived very accurately using the recent data\navailable (e.g., from Hinode (SOT/SP)) and advanced inversion codes. The SASSA is\nthe best measure of the global magnetic twist of sunspot magnetic fields at observed\nheight, irrespective of the force-free nature and the shape of sunspots. The sunspots with\nsignificant twist and no net currents show consistency with the fibril bundle nature of\nthe sunspots. The study of evolution of SASSA of sunspots showed threshold values for\ndifferent classes of X-ray flares. This is an important discovery which was being sought\nafter for many decades. The magnetic helicity sign of active regions studied, has good\ncorrelation with the sign of chirality of associated features observed at chromospheric\n\n\f6\n\nSanjiv Kumar Tiwari\n\nand coronal heights. The majority of sunspots observed in the declining phase of solar\ncycle 23 follow a reverse hemispheric helicity rule, whereas most of the AR's emerged in\nthe beginning of solar cycle 24 follow the conventional helicity rule. This result indicates\nthat revisiting the hemispheric helicity rule using data sets of several years is required.\nAcknowledgements\nThe presentation of this paper in the IAU Symposium 273 was possible due to partial support from the National Science Foundation grant numbers ATM 0548260, AST\n0968672 and NASA - Living With a Star grant number 09-LWSTRT09-0039.
