With also precision determinations of the branching ratios of B \u2192 Xs \u03b3, B \u2192 K\u03c0,\nand other rare B decays[2, 3, 4], the study of rare B decays has entered a precision era. These decays being rare\nin the Standard Model (SM) are very sensitive probes for\nnew physics beyond the SM.\nThe recently measured CP asymmetry ACP (B\u0304 0 \u2192\nK \u03c0 ) has important implications for B decays and\nthere have been some discussions in the literatures[5].\nThe experimental value for ACP (B\u0304 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) is substantially different from the predictions based on factorization calculations which predict ACP (B\u0304 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) to\nbe positive for a set of favored hadronic parameters [6, 7].\nAlthough at this stage one cannot conclude that there is\nthe need of new physics beyond the SM, as there are also\nmethods which can give a value close to the experimental data, such as pQCD calculations[8]. We emphases\nthat at present there is not a method which can explain\nall data, branching ratios and CP asymmetries in B decays simultaneously. It is, nevertheless, important to see\nwhat new physics may be needed to explain the data\nand what predictions can be made by consistently using\none method. When combined with other processes which\nare more hadronic model independent crucial information\nabout new physics beyond SM can be extracted.\n\u2212 +\n\nIn this letter we take such an approach to study\nimplications of the CP asymmetry in B\u0304 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 +\non supersymmetric (SUSY) flavor changing neutral current (FCNC) interaction via gluonic dipole term using\nQCD improved factorization.

We will not display the full sets\nof Oi and ci here, but only give the definitions of the\ngluonic and photonic dipole operators O11 and O12 for\nthe convenience of later discussions.

G\u03bc\u03bd and F\u03bc\u03bd are the gluon and\nphoton field strengths. In the SM c11 = \u22120.151 and\nc12 = \u22120.318[9, 10, 11].\nWhen going beyond the SM, there are some modifications of the above coefficients. In SUSY models, exchanges of gluino and squark with Left-Right squark mixing can generate a large contribution to c11,12 at one-loop\nlevel[13, 14] since their interactions are strong couplings\nin strength and also enhanced by a factor of the ratio\nof gluino mass to the b quark mass[15]. We will concentrate on the effects of this interaction, although there are\nalso possible large contributions from other sources[16].\nIn general exchange of squarks and gluinos can generate\nnon-zero c11,12 for dipole operators with 1 + \u03b35 , as well\nas with non-zero c\u203211,12 for dipole operators with 1 \u2212 \u03b35 .\nThe Wilson coefficients csusy\n11,12 from SUSY contributions\nobtained in the mass insertion approximation are given\n\n\f2\nby, for the case with 1 + \u03b35 [14],\n\ncontribution to ACP (B \u2192 XS \u03b3) is given by\n\n\u221a\nbs\n2\u03c0\u03b1s (mg\u0303 ) \u03b4LR\nmg\u0303\n=\nG0 (xgq ),\n2\nGF mg\u0303 Vtb Vts\u2217 mb\n\u221a\nbs\nmg\u0303\n2\u03c0\u03b1s (mg\u0303 ) \u03b4LR\nF0 (xgq ),\ncsusy\n12 (mg\u0303 ) =\n2\nGF mg\u0303 Vtb Vts\u2217 mb\n\nAXS \u03b3 =\n\ncsusy\n11 (mg\u0303 )\n\nx[22 \u2212 20x \u2212 2x2 + (16x \u2212 x2 + 9) ln(x)]\n,\n3(1 \u2212 x)4\n4x[1 + 4x \u2212 5x2 + (4x + 2x2 ) ln(x)]\n, (3)\nF0 (x) = \u2212\n9(1 \u2212 x)4\n\nbs\nwhere \u03b4LR\nparameterizes the mixing of left and right\nsquarks, xgq = m2g\u0303 /m2q\u0303 is the ratio of gluino mass mg\u0303\n\u2032\n\nsusy\nand squark mass mq\u0303 .

If mg\u0303 is of\norder a few hundred GeV, there is an enhancement factor\nof (mg\u0303 /mb )(m2W /m2g\u0303 ) for the SUSY dipole interactions.\nbs\nIn this case even a small \u03b4LR,RL\n, which can easily satisfy\n0\n0\nconstraints from B \u2212 B\u0304 mixing and other data, can\nhave large effects on rare B decays.\nWe first consider constraint on the SUSY paramebs\nters \u03b4LR,RL\nfrom B \u2192 XS \u03b3.

We use \u03b4 = 90% which gives Br(B \u2192 XS \u03b3) \u2248\n3.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 , which is consistent with the data and the\ncomplete NLO QCD results in Ref. [12].\nAlthough experimentally CP asymmetry in B \u2192 XS \u03b3\nhas not been well established, there are constraints from\nexperiments with 0.005 \u00b1 0.036 [3]. We will also take\nthis information into account. In the SM, the leading\n\nFrom Ref.[11], we find a87 \u223c \u22129.5%, a27 \u223c 1.06%, and\na28 \u223c 0.16%. For the calculation of ACP (B \u2192 XS \u03b3)\nin SUSY model considered here, one just replaces cSM\n11,12\nby the total c11,12 and adds a term a87 Im[c\u203211 c\u2032\u2217\n12 ] to the\nnumerator and |c\u203212 |2 to the denominator in the above\nequation.\n(\u2032 )\nUsing the above, deviations of c11,12 from the SM values are severely constrained. In Figure 1 we show the\nbs\nallowed ranges for the absolute values of \u03b4LR,RL\nand\ntheir phases \u03c4 for mg\u0303 = 300GeV and mq\u0303 in the range\n100 \u223c 1000GeV at the one \u03c3 level. We find that the constraints from Br(B \u2192 XS \u03b3) are slightly more stringent\nthat those from ACP (B \u2192 XS \u03b3). Using the allowed pa(\u2032 )\nrameters, one can obtain the allowed c11 through Eq.(3)\nand to study implications for other rare B decays.

The light-dark doted areas are the\nallowed parameter spaces from Br(B \u2192 Xs \u03b3) and ACP (B \u2192\nXS \u03b3) constraints. The dark doted areas are allowed ranges\nby ACP (B\u0304 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) constraint. Figure 1a (on the left)\nand Figure 1b (on the right) are for the dipole operators with\n1 + \u03b35 and 1 \u2212 \u03b35 , respectively.\n\nWe now study whether after the constraint from B \u2192\nXS \u03b3, the observed CP asymmetry ACP (B\u0304 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + )\ncan be reproduced and analysis what constraint can be\nput on the SUSY parameters. For this purpose, we need\nto calculate the amplitudes for B \u2192 K\u03c0 decays. We follow the QCD factorization approach in Ref.[6]. Since O12\nis suppressed by a factor of \u03b1em /\u03b1s compared with O11 ,\nwe will neglect its contribution in our later discussions.\nWe find that the gluonic\ndipole contributions to the de\u221a\n0\ncay\namplitudes:\n\u2212\n2A(\nB\u0304\n\u2192 K\u0304 0 \u03c0 0 ), A(B\u0304 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + ),\n\u221a\n\u2212\n\u2212 0\n\u2212\n2A(B \u2192 K \u03c0 ), A(B \u2192 K\u0304 0 \u03c0 \u2212 ) are the same,\nwhich are given by\nGF\nCF \u03b1s\ni \u221a fK m2B F0B\u2192\u03c0 (m2K )Vtb Vts\u2217\n(c11 \u2212 c\u203211 )GK\u03c0 , (6)\n2\u03c0Nc\n2\n\n\f3\nR1\nwhere GK\u03c0 = 0 \u03c6K (x)dx/(1 \u2212 x) + RK . RK =\n2m2K /ms mb , and CF = (Nc2 \u2212 1)/(2Nc ) with the number of color Nc = 3. \u03c6K (x) is the light cone distribution\namplitude.\nIn our numerical analysis we will take the CKM parameters to be known, with the standard parametrization\ns12 = 0.2243, s23 = 0.0413, s13 = 0.0037, \u03b413 = 1.05,\nwhich is the central value given by the Particle Data\nGroup[17]. With the SM amplitudes obtained and the default values for the hadronic parameters used in Ref. [6],\nwe obtain the CP asymmetry ACP (B\u0304 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) in the\nSM to be 0.15. This is different in sign with the experimental value. When SUSY dipole interactions are\nincluded the experimental value can be reproduced. For\nexample mg\u0303 = mq\u0303 = 300GeV, \u03b4LR = 2.62 \u00d7 10\u22123 e0.238i ,\n\u03b4RL = 4.31 \u00d7 10\u22123 e1.007i the asymmetry ACP (B\u0304 0 \u2192\nK \u2212 \u03c0 + ) is approximately \u22120.114. Using the same set of\nSUSY parameters, we have Br(B \u2192 Xs \u03b3) = 3.48\u00d710\u22124,\nACP (B \u2192 XS \u03b3) = 0.016. It is clear that the CP asymmetry ACP (B\u0304 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) can be brought to be in agreement with data at one \u03c3 level when SUSY gluonic dipole\ninteractions are included.\nTo see how the CP asymmetry provides stringent constraint on the SUSY flavor changing parameters, we show\nin Figure 1 the parameter space allowed from ACP (B\u0304 0 \u2192\nK \u2212 \u03c0 + ) (the dark doted areas) on top of the allowed\nranges by B \u2192 XS \u03b3 constraint alone at the one \u03c3 level.\nWe see that the CP asymmetry in B\u0304 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + considerably reduces the allowed parameter space.\nUsing the above allowed SUSY parameters, one can\npredict the branching ratios for all the four B \u2192 K\u03c0\nbranching ratios and also the unmeasured CP asymmetries. Since the branching ratios involve unknown\nB \u2192 K and B \u2192 \u03c0 form factors, one cannot make precise predictions without a good understanding of these\nform factors. We therefore study just the CP asymmetries in which large part of the form factor effects are\ncancelled out. In Figure 2, we show the direct CP asymmetries in B \u2212 \u2192 K\u0304 0 \u03c0 \u2212 , B \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 0 and B\u0304 0 \u2192 K\u0304 0 \u03c0 0\nfor the allowed parameter space in Figure 1. We see that\nlarge CP asymmetries are allowed. In particular that the\nCP asymmetry in B \u2212 \u2192 K\u0304 0 \u03c0 \u2212 can be as large as \u22120.3,\nwhereas in the SM this asymmetry is very small.

There are two\nCP violating parameters Af and Sf which can be measured in time dependent decays of B and B\u0304 produced\nat e+ e\u2212 colliders at the \u03a5(4S) resonance, ACP (t) =\nAf cos(\u2206t\u2206mB ) + Sf sin(\u2206t\u2206mB ). The parameters Af\nand Sf are related to the decay amplitudes as\nAf =\n\n|\u03bbf |2 \u2212 1\n,\n|\u03bbf |2 + 1\n\nSf = \u22122\n\nIm[(qB /pB )\u03bbf ]\n,\n|\u03bbf |2 + 1\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03bbf = \u0100/A and \u0100 and A are the decay amplitudes\nof B\u0304 0 \u2192 fCP and B 0 \u2192 fCP , respectively. qB /pB is the\nmixing parameter in B \u2212 B\u0304 mixing.\nFor B\u0304 0 \u2192 K\u0304 \u22170 \u03b3 \u2192 \u03c0 0 KS \u03b3 and B 0 \u2192 K \u22170 \u03b3 \u2192 \u03c0 0 KS \u03b3,\nwe have[11, 15, 18]\nSK \u2217 \u03b3 = \u22122\n\nIm[(qB /pB )(c12 c\u203212 )]\n.\n|c12 |2 + |c\u203212 |2\n\n(8)\n\nTo the leading order AK \u2217 \u03b3 is the same as ACP (B \u2192\nXS \u03b3).\nNote that the hadronic matrix element <\nK \u2217 |s\u0304\u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd (1 \u00b1 \u03b35 )b|B > does not appear, which makes\nthe calculation simple and reliable. In order to have a\nnon-zero SK \u2217 \u03b3 both c12 and c\u203212 cannot be zero.\nIn the SM the asymmetries AK \u2217 \u03b3 and SK \u2217 \u03b3 are preSM\ndicted to be small with ASM\nK \u2217 \u03b3 \u2248 0.5%, SK \u2217 \u03b3 \u2248 3%[11, 18].\nWith SUSY gluonic dipole interaction, the predictions for\nthese CP asymmetries can be changed dramatically[15].\nWith the constraints obtained previously, we find that\nthe parameter qB /pB is not affected very much compared with the SM calculation. To a good approximation\nqB /pB = e\u22122i\u03b2 .\nA large gluonic dipole interaction also has a big impact\non B \u2192 \u03c6KS decays[19]. In the SM, A\u03c6KS is predicted\nto be very small and S\u03c6KS is predicted to be the same as\nSJ/\u03c8KS = sin(2\u03b2). With SUSY gluonic dipole contribution, the decay amplitude for B \u2192 \u03c6KS will be changed\nand the predicted value for both A\u03c6KS and S\u03c6KS can be\nvery different from those in the SM[19]. To obtain concrete values, we again use QCD factorization to evaluate\nthe amplitude. We obtain the contributions of c11 and\nc\u203211 to B \u2192 \u03c6Ks amplitude to be\nGF\n\u221a m\u03c6 f\u03c6 F1B\u2192K (m2\u03c6 )\u01eb\u03bc\u03c6 * (P\u03bcB + P\u03bcK )(c11 + c\u203211 )G\u03c6,11 ,(9)\n2\nwhere \u01eb\u03bc\u03c6 is the polarization vector of \u03c6.

The\nresults are shown in Figure 3. The current values of\nSK \u2217 \u03b3 and AK \u2217 \u03b3 from Babar (Belle) are: 0.57 \u00b1 0.32 \u00b1\n009(\u22120.00 \u00b1 0.38), 0.25 \u00b1 0.63 \u00b1 0.14(\u22120.79+0.63\n\u22120.50 \u00b1 0.09),\nrespectively [20]. From Figure 3, we see that the allowed ranges can cover the central values of SK \u2217 \u03b3 from\nBabar and Bell, but it is not possible to obtain the central value of AK \u2217 \u03b3 by Belle.

From Figure 3 we see\nthat the current data of A\u03c6KS and S\u03c6KS can be easily\naccommodated by the allowed ranges. We also note that\nthe allowed ranges can cover last year's Belle data. Since\nthe error bars on the data are large, no definitive conclusions can be drawn at present.\nIn summary we have studied the implications of the\nrecently measured CP asymmetry in B\u0304 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + on\nSUSY flavour changing interactions. The experimental\nvalue for this asymmetry \u22120.114 \u00b1 0.020 is substantially\ndifferent than QCD factorization prediction. We have\nshown that SUSY FCNC interaction via gluonic dipole\ncan explain this difference. The allowed SUSY parameter\nspace is considerably reduced compared with constraint\nfrom B \u2192 Xs \u03b3 alone. CP asymmetries in other B \u2192\nK\u03c0 decays are predicted to be sizeable. We also find\nthat the allowed time dependent CP asymmetries Sf in\nB\u0304 0 \u2192 K\u0304 \u22170 \u03b3 \u2192 \u03c0 0 KS \u03b3 and B\u0304 0 \u2192 \u03c6KS are in the ranges\nof \u22120.4 \u223c 1 and \u22121 \u223c 1, respectively. These predictions\nare quite different from the ones in the SM and can be\ntested in the near future.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and Specialized Research\nFund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education.\n\n[11] A.L.
