In this paper we present a fully selfconsistent\nSSC model with particle acceleration due to shock and\nstochastic acceleration (Fermi-I and Fermi-II-Processes respectively) to model the quiescent spectral energy distribution (SED) observed from PKS 2155. The simultaneous\nAugust/September 2008 multiwavelength data of H.E.S.S.,\nFermi, RXTE/SWIFT and ATOM give new constraints to\nthe high-energy peak in the SED concerning its curvature.\nWe find that, in our model, a monoenergetic injection of\nelectrons at \u03b30 = 910 into the model region, which are accelerated by Fermi-I- and Fermi-II-processes while suffering\nsynchrotron and inverse Compton losses, finally leads to the\nobserved SED of PKS 2155-30.4 shown in H. E. S. S. and\nFermi-LAT collaborations (2009). In contrast to other SSC\nmodels our parameters arise from the jet's microphysics and\nthe spectrum is evolving selfconsistently from diffusion and\nacceleration. The \u03b30 -factor can be interpreted as two counterstreaming plasmas due to the motion of the blob at a bulk\nfactor of \u0393 = 58 and opposed moving upstream electrons at\nmoderate Lorentz factors with an average of \u03b3u \u2248 8.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAmong the class of active galactic nuclei (AGN), blazars are\nshowing a spectral energy distribution (SED) that is strongly\ndominated by nonthermal emission across a wide range of\nwavelengths, from radio waves to gamma rays, and rapid,\nlarge-amplitude variability. Presumably, these characteristics\nare due to a highly relativistic jet which covers a small angle\nto the line-of-sight, emitting the observable Doppler-boosted\nsynchrotron and inverse Compton radiation.\nIn SSC models the characteristic double humped spectra\nof blazars are explained by electrons in the jet emitting\nCorrespondence to: M. Weidinger\nmweidinger@astro.uni-wuerzburg.de\n\nsynchrotron radiation while being accelerated in a magnetic\nfield, which gives the first peak in the SED. These high\nenergy electrons upscatter the very same synchrotron\nphotons to TeV energies due to the inverse Compton effect,\nresulting in a second peak in the SED. Another approach to\nthe explanation of the double humped structure are proton\ninitiated electromagnetic cascades (e.g., Mannheim, 1993)\nor external Compton models.\nThe key issue is to understand which physical mechanisms\nare leading to such SEDs. In particular that means to explain\nthe ultrarelativistic electron spectra within the jet, which are\nbelieved to be responsible for the gamma radiation.\nThe high peaked BL Lac objects (HBLs) as a subclass\nof blazars show a peak in their SED in the X-ray regime,\nsuggesting that an inverse Compton peak should occur at\ncorrespondingly high gamma-ray energies. In fact, a large\nfraction of the known nearby HBLs have already been\ndiscovered with Cerenkov telescopes, such as H.E.S.S.,\nMAGIC, and VERITAS. Since 2008 the Fermi satellite\nmeasures at these high gamma-ray energies. The energy\nrange of the Fermi data is slightly different from the H.E.S.S.\nand VERITAS-Telescopes which gives new constraints to\nthe SEDs.\nThe first Fermi data published is from PKS 2155-30.4,\na HBL at redshift z = 0.117 (luminosity distance:\ndL = 1.67 * 1027 cm) (H. E. S. S. and Fermi-LAT collaborations, 2009).\nWe present a selfconsistent SSC model that is not only\nable to model the SED of PKS 2155-30.4 shown in\nH. E. S. S. and Fermi-LAT collaborations (2009) but also to\npartly explain the \"ad-hoc\" injected particle spectra of many\nSSC models. Therefore we introduce and solve the kinetic\nequation describing the synchrotron-self-Compton emission\nnumerically in two different zones within the jet (see section\n2). We use the exact Klein-Nishina cross section which\nis important at the relevant very high gamma-energies to\n\n\f2\n\nM. Weidinger et al.: Modelling the steady state SED of PKS 2155\n\ndescribe the inverse Compton radiation and energy losses of\nthe electrons. The emphasis lies on the accurate treatment of\nthe two possible particle acceleration mechanisms (Fermi-Iand Fermi-II) which are able to produce high energy\nelectrons as well as on the selfconsistent treatment of the\nradiation processes.\n2\n\nTHE MODEL\n\n2.1\n\nModel geometry\n\nWe extend the well-established SSC model by Fermi-I and\nFermi-II acceleration mechanisms to a selfconsistent SSC\nmodel with two zones in a nested setup. Both regions (the\nacceleration- and the radiation zone) forming the blob are assumed to be spherical and homogeneous containing isotropically distributed non-thermal electrons and a randomly oriented magnetic field. The acceleration zone is assumed to\nbe spatially significantly smaller than the surrounding radiation zone. Furthermore every electron leaving the accelerationzone enters the radiation zone. These assumptions are\ncommon place in SSC models (e.g., Kirk et al., 1998).\nTo derive the kinetic equations describing the time evolution\nof ne (\u03b3), Ne (\u03b3) (ne in the acceleration zone, Ne in the radiation zone) as the differential electron densities we use the\none dimensional diffusion approximation (eq. (1)) of the relativistic Vlasov equation (e.g. Schlickeiser, 2002), which is\napplicable due to the assumptions made above.\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n1 \u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\nf (p, t) = 2\nF p, f, f\n+ S(p, t) ,\n(1)\n\u2202t\np \u2202p\n\u2202p\nwhere f (p, t) is a particle distribution function, with the particle's momentum value p. F describes the contributing processes, such as synchrotron radiation or acceleration, in momentum space. Catastrophic particle gains and losses are\nconsidered via S(p, t).\nMaking use of the relativistic approximation E \u2248 pc = \u03b3mc\nand the relation n(p, t) = 4\u03c0p2 f (p, t) one can derive the\nkinetic equations governing the model.\n2.2\n2.2.1\n\nKinetic equations\nAcceleration zone\n\nWhile the blob propagates through the jet, electrons are continuously injected into the acceleration zone when considering the blob's rest frame, leading to an injection function\nQinj (\u03b3, t) := Q0 \u03b4(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b30 )\u03b8(t \u2212 t0 ) , t0 = 0\n\n(2)\n\nwhich we assume monoenergetic and time independent.\nThese low- to mid-energy electrons are accelerated systematically and stochastically due to Fermi-I and Fermi-II processes while suffering synchrotron and inverse Compton\nlosses. Energy losses due to inverse Compton scattering are\n\ncalculated using the full Klein-Nishina cross section, see eq.\n(15). This leads to PIC (\u03b3) given in eq. (8) with the corresponding radiation field nPH of the acceleration zone. Due\nto the non equilibrium of magnetic and radiative energy in\nthe acceleration zone the energy losses via inverse Compton scattering can become quite significant and must not be\nneglected, also the Thomson limit is not appropriate here.\nThe synchrotron losses are calculated using eq. (3) from\nGinzburg and Syrovatskii (1969) for isotropic particle distributions\nPs (\u03b3) =\n\n1 \u03c3T B 2 2\n\u03b3 = \u03b2s \u03b3 2\n6\u03c0 mc\n\n(3)\n\nwith the Thomson cross section \u03c3T .

Substituting p \u2192 \u03b3 in eq. (1) and eq. (4) according to the relativistic approximation mentioned above, one will finally find\neq.

(6) for tacc is a direct consequence of the derivation of eq.\n(5) out of eq. (1) using eqn. (4) and (3). The expression in\neq. (6) includes the analytical timescale for non-relativistic\nshock acceleration. According to Bednarz and Ostrowski\n(1996) and especially to Ellison et al. (1990) the acceleration timescale for parallel relativistic shock waves decreases\napproximately by a factor of 3. We did not take into account\nthis behavior for it is unclear how the analytical expression\nlooks like in that case. Secondly we are omitting the energy\ndependency of tacc using hard spheres for the plasma instabilities anyway. This issue is irrelevant for the modelling\n(for we are setting numerical values for tacc ) and the type of\nenergy spectrum (a powerlaw) produced by Fermi-I acceleration is identical in the non-relativistic and relativistic case\n\n\fM.

All escaping electrons enter\nthe radiation zone downstream the jet. The seperation in two\nzones can firstly explain the injected electron spectra and secondly takes account of a much more confined shock region\nfor Fermi-I acceleration will probably not occur in the whole\nblob region when considering physical sources.\nOur model can be compared with the model presented by\nKatarzy\u0144ski et al. (2006). The kinetic equation (eq. 3 in their\npaper) is almost similar to the kinetic equation in the acceleration zone eq. 5. One major difference to our model is their\nsole use of stochastic acceleration. In fact their model is the\nlimit of our model for a \u2192 0. Additionally they limit themselves to radiation in the acceleration zone, which is useful\nwhen not taking into account shock acceleration. Besides\nthat there are number of minor differences regarding the exact treatment of inverse Compton losses and the derivation of\nescape rates.\nDue to the small spatial extent the acceleration zone does not\ncontribute to the SED directly, i.e. nph (\u03bd) is only calculated\nin order to determine the inverse Compton loss rate for the\nelectrons in the acceleration zone.\n\n3\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n\u03b3\n\n5\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n7\n\n10\n\n8\n\n10\n\nFig. 1. Lossrates due to the inverse Compton effect for an electron\nof Lorentzfactor \u03b3 in the model photon field of PKS 2155 (Thompson limit, red and used Klein-Nishina treatment, black) compared\nto the synchrotron losses, blue. Other losses like adiabatic cooling,\npair production are irrelevant at typical SSC configurations.\n\nleading to a time resolved model. The loss rates for the\nelectron distribution of PKS 2155 in the steady state are\nshown in Fig. 1, which indicates that in our case the inverse\nCompton losses would be slightly overestimated in the often\nused Thomson limit for all Lorentzfactors R\u03b3 because of the\ndependency on the photon field Pthom \u221d d\u03bd\u03bdNph \u03b3 2 and\nits special shape due to the modified injection at \u03b30 = 910.\nThis would not be the case for low energetic injected electrons and the resulting powerlaw-like photon distribution.\nFor high Lorentzfactors \u03b3 however the deviation of the\nThompson limit for the inverse Compton scattering to the\nreal Klein-Nishina treatment becomes more significant in\neach case. Again electrons escaping the blob are taken into\naccount via tesc,rad = \u03b7Rrad /c with the empirical factor \u03b7\nset to \u03b7 = 10. Both electronic PDEs are connected via the\n3\ncatastrophic particle loss/gain-term.

The downstream motion of the electrons induces the sequence of solving the acceleration zone's equation before the kinetic equation of the radiation zone in each time step. The simple Euler\nscheme was found adequate to do the time integration.\nIn the acceleration zone we had to combine the CrankNicholson scheme (Press, 2002) with Godunov's method to\nprovide both correct treatment of the characteristics and stability for the derivation in \u03b3. In the radiation zone the characteristic flows, due to the absence of acceleration, only in one\ndirection making the Crank-Nicholson scheme sufficient.\nWith our carefully tested code it is possible to calculate the\ndynamics of SEDs in a range of 20 orders of magnitude. The\nimplemented code complies particle conservation in each\nzone alone and both together as well as the conservation of\nthe total energy (i.e. of the electrons and the photons) over\ntypical simulation times with a maximum error of O(5%).\nFor negligible stochastic acceleration, i.e. a \u2192 \u221e, and without a radiation field, i.e. no inverse Compton losses, the\nsteady state solution for the kinetic equation yields\n1\nne,steady (\u03b3) = C 2\n\u03b3\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n\u2212 \u03b2s tacc\n\u03b3\n\n\u0013 tacct\u2212tesc\nesc\n\n\fM.

This is leading to a deep dip between the optical/X-ray\nand the gamma-ray peak. We are able to model the SED of\nPKS 2155-30.4 with our model by setting\n\u03b30 = 910\n\n(19)\n\nfor the monoenergetic injection into the acceleration zone.\nThis is rather unusual but required to model the SED of PKS\n2155. Such moderate but not small Lorentz factors can be\nexplained e.g. by two counterstreaming plasmas. If the upstream electrons would be at rest, the bulk doppler factor of\n\u03b4 = 116 would automatically lead to \u03b30 = \u0393 \u2248 58. Assuming speculatively that the upstream electrons moving in\nthe opposite direction of the blob with a mean velocity of\nvu hence a upstream Lorentz-Factor \u03b3u the \u03b30 factor in the\nblob's rest frame must be calculated according to the relativistic superposition:\nv\nu\nu\n\u03b30 = t1 \u2212\n\n\u221a\n\n!2 \u22121\np\n\u03932 \u2212 1\u0393 + \u03b3u2 \u2212 1\u03b3u\n\u03932 + \u03b3u2 \u2212 1\n\n(20)\n\nSolving eq. (20) for our setup we find \u03b3u \u2248 8 for the upsteam\nelectrons which are streaming towards the blob. The numerically solved steady state electron density in the acceleration\nzone is shown in Fig. 2. We also show the time development\nfor a \"switched on\" injection, i.e. ne (\u03b3)|t<0 = 0 \u2200\u03b3 and\nQ = Q0 \u03b4(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b30 )\u03b8(t), until the steady state is reached.\nIn Fig. 2 it can clearly be seen tvhat accelerating electrons\n\nelectron density\nacceleration zone\n\n4\n\n10\n\ninjection function, Q0\n2\n\ntime evolution\nsteady state\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-3\n\n10\n\nne(\u03b3) / cm\n\nwith \u03b3max = (tacc \u03b2s ) and the constant C determined by\nthe injection function Q. The implemented numeric model\nconverges against this solution for sufficient simulation time.\nAdditionally it was tested against the steady state analytical\nsolution with Fermi-II processes given in Schlickeiser (1984)\nwith no significant deviations. Setting tesc,rad \u2192 \u221e and neglecting inverse Compton scattering the spectral index of the\npowerlaw part of the electron distribution in the radiation\nzone is (analytically) reduced by one compared to the one\nin the acceleration zone, which also was confirmed by the\nimplemented code. The inverse Compton scattering rate was\nconfirmed against the approximate analytical results (low energetic Thompson regime and extreme Klein-Nishina limit)\nbefore implementing. Concerning the photon distributions\nwe validated the expected spectral indices in the steady state\nsolution for the different frequency regimes, which together\nwith the energy conservation between electrons and photons\napproves the integrity of the model.\nA detailed description of the used numeric techniques as well\nas the implemented model also in context with the variability\nof the sources will be given in a paper yet to be published.\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n10\n\n-10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n\u03b3\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n6\n\nFig. 2. Steady state electron distribution and its time development in\nthe acceleration zone modelling the SED of PKS 2155-30.4 shown\nin Fig. 3 as arising from the injection function Q0 . The corresponding intrinsic times are t = 1000 s (dashed black), t = 5000 s\n(dashed blue), t = 1 * 104 s (dashed red), t = 2 * 104 s (dashed\ngreen). The steady state with its rising and falling powerlaw and the\nexponential cutoff at \u03b3 \u2248 105 is reached at about t = 105 s.\n\nusing Fermi-I and Fermi-II processes leads to powerlaw electron distributions with an exponential cut-off often used as\nthe ad-hoc injection function in onezone-SSC models (Chiang and B\u00f6ttcher, 2002) (right side of \u03b30 in Fig. 2), thus explaining them using the diffusion theory derived from plasma\nphysics. By injecting electrons with eq. (19) and significant\nstochastic acceleration (i.e. a = O(1)) we are also able to\nproduce rising electron spectra before decreasing in a powerlaw and an exponential cut-off, like introduced in B\u00f6ttcher\nand Chiang (2002) (left side of \u03b30 in Fig. 2). The Fermi-II\nprocesses are responsible for the rising power-law and exponential cut-off, whereas the ratio of tacc /tesc determines the\nspectral index of the power-law at \u03b3 > \u03b30 . It can clearly\nbe seen from Fig. 2 that the convergence against the steady\nstate solution for the electron density begins relatively rapid\nwhile slowing down eventually. The simulation time when\nthe steady state is reached corresponds to the escape time\nof the electrons in the acceleration zone. When concerning\nvariability and time resolved lightcurves of blazars this is an\nadvantage of the twozone model because the rising part in\nsuch lightcurves corresponds partially to the escape time of\nthe acceleration zone (while the falling part is connected to\nthe response time of the system, trad,esc ).\nAn acceleration zone electron density as shown by the solid\nblack curve in Fig. 2, leads to the desired broken power-law\nelectron spectrum in the radiation zone which finally is able\nto model the SED of PKS 2155-30.4 (see Fig. 3 and Fig. 4).\nWe used the parameters in Table 1 for the model SED in Fig.\n4 (black, solid line).

The intrinsic times are t = 1 * 104 s (dashed black), t = 2 *\n104 s (dashed blue), t = 5 * 104 s (dashed red), t = 1 * 105 s (dashed\ngreen), the complete steady state is reached at about t = 2 * 106 s,\nwhich correlates to the response time of the system due to tesc,rad .\n\nsponds to a fit assuming a black body for the thermal contribution of the host galaxy thus the ATOM optical data is not\nto be taken into account for the SSC modelling. The curvature and deep dip in the model SED is a direct consequence\nof the rising part in the electron density of the acceleration\nzone. Thus it can be modeled by varying the ratio a of shock\nto stochastic acceleration. All the parameters in Table 1 are\nconsistent with the limits given via other observations and\nstatistics, e.g. determination of \u0393 using superluminal motion\nof Quasar jets.\nThe recent Fermi, H.E.S.S. and ATOM data (H. E. S. S. and\nFermi-LAT collaborations, 2009) have been averaged over\na period of 14 days and show a lowstate of the HBL PKS\n2155-30.4. This is confirmed by the Aharonian et al. (2005)\ndata of H.E.S.S. a few years ago which show the same flux\nlevel as the recent data. We used the EBL studies described\nin Primack et al. (2005) to do the EBL deabsorption for the\nH.E.S.S. datapoints, a correction of the Fermi data is not necessary.\nThe time development of the SED due to a switched on in-\n\njection of electrons into the acceleration zone at time t0 = 0\nis shown in Fig. 3. It can clearly be seen that the final state\nof the model SSC correlates with the response time of the\nradiation zone tesc,rad and that the convergence again begins\nfast and slows down rapidly at higher simulation times.\n\n5\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nOur model is able to explain the injection function of\nmany onezone-SSC models as shock and stochastic acceleration of electrons upstream the jet entering the blob\nwhile continuously suffering synchrotron losses. By introducing Fermi-II acceleration we get rid of the sharp\ncut-off introduced in Kardashev (1962) or Kirk et al. (1998)\nwhich probably does not occur in physical sources. Additionally we are able to model relatively complex electron\ndensities with increasing and decreasing parts through\nthe stochastic acceleration of electrons, only by varying\nthe monoenergetic injection to higher \u03b30 . In contrast to\nthe ad-hoc injection of some onezone-SSC models such\nLorentz factors have a physically reasonable, but highly\nspeculative, explanation as upstream previously accelerated\nbut already partially cooled electrons. These electrons are\naveragely moving in the opposite direction of the blob with\na mean Lorentz factor of \u03b3u \u2248 8 resulting, together with\nthe motion of the blob, in \u03b30 \u2248 900 for the monoenergetic\ninjection function used in the acceleration zone of our model.\nAs recent data points out, these complex electron distributions are necessary to model the new constraints\nconcerning the gamma-ray peak of blazar's SEDs if one\ndoes not simply shift the synchrotron-peak to achieve the\ninverse Compton spectrum (e.g., Kataoka et al., 2000). The\ncurvature of the peak, and thus the deep dip between the\ntwo humps, is a direct consequence of the rising part in\nthe responsible electron distribution within the blob. This\nconstraint rules out many SSC models, which are not able to\nproduce such electron spectra.\nWith our model we are able to form the curvature of the\ngamma-ray peak and the dip by varying the influence of\nthe Fermi-II processes. The shape and position of the\nsynchrotron peak in the model SED is dominated by tacc\nand Racc , Rrad as well as B. For the parameters concerning\nthe acceleration arise from plasmaphysics considerations we\ngain insight into the jets microphysics while modelling observed SEDs. We have also shown that in such environments\nthe Thomson approximation for the inverse Compton effect\ncan not always be applied, especially when considering time\nresolution and hence non equilibria of the energy distribution\nin the blob.\nHere we only introduced steady state solutions of our\nmodel, but due to the spatially relatively small acceleration\nregion, which is at least an oder of magnitude smaller than\n\n\fM. Weidinger et al.: Modelling the steady state SED of PKS 2155\nthe emitting region, this twozone-SSC model is able to\nselfconsistently model the rising part in the lightcurves of\nflaring blazars which are connected to the behavior in the\nacceleration zone, especially the energy transport from low\nto high energies. This, together with the consequences of\nthe model geometry on the observable SEDs and lightcurves\nof blazars like in Sokolov et al. (2004), will be subject of a\nfollowing paper.\n\nReferences\nAharonian et al.: Multi-wavelength observations of PKS 2155-304\nwith HESS, 442, 895\u2013907, doi:10.1051/0004-6361:20053353,\n2005.\nBednarz, J. and Ostrowski, M.: The acceleration time-scale for firstorder Fermi acceleration in relativistic shock waves, 283, 447\u2013\n456, 1996.\nBlumenthal, G.

Lowstate of PKS 2155-30.4 with the simultaneous data of ATOM, SWIFT, RXTE, Fermi and H.E.S.S of the August/September\n2008 campaign from H. E. S. S. and Fermi-LAT collaborations (2009) (red triangles and circles). The 2003 H.E.S.S. data (blue circles) is\nalso shown, proofing the lowstate of PKS2155-30.4. The VHE data have been deabsorbed using Primack et al. (2005). The dashed black\ncurve shows a thermal fit for the contribution of the host-galaxy. Our model SSC fit, arising from the steady state electron distribution in the\nradiation zone is shown in the solid black curve, a moderate energy injection at \u03b30 \u2248 910 into the acceleration zone together with stochastic\nand systematic acceleration is needed to meet the curvature of the VHE peak given via the Fermi data.\n\n\f"}
