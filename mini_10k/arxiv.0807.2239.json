INTRODUCTION\n\nThe central parsec of our Galaxy harbors different\ngroups of young stars orbiting the central SMBH. These\ninclude one or two stellar disks at \u2248 0.1 pc from Sgr\nA\u2217 made up of 5\u20136 Myr old stars (Paumard et al. 2006),\nand a number of stars on highly eccentric orbits even\ncloser, the so-called S stars (Eckart & Genzel 1997).\nWith orbital periods as small as 15 years, the S stars\nprovide powerful constraints on the mass and size of\nthe central dark object (Ghez et al. 2005). While the\norigin of the stellar disk(s) observed in the Galactic\ncenter can be understood (Levin & Beloborodov 2003;\nGenzel et al. 2003; Nayakshin & Cuadra 2005; Gerhard\n2001; McMillan & Portegies Zwart 2003), the S stars\nshow a puzzling combination of interesting features\n(Eckart & Genzel 1997): They are very young (<\n10 Myr), with less than 0.01 pc a factor of 10 closer to\nthe SMBH than the closest young population known (the\nstellar disks), and move around Sgr A\u2217 on randomly oriented eccentric orbits.\nA number of mechanisms to create the S stars have\nbeen proposed, but so far none of them was able to\naccount for all their properties (see also review by\nAlexander 2005): It has been suggested that the S stars\nare not young but rejuvenated stars or exotic objects,\nbut this is in conflict with their spectral properties,\nshowing they are ordinary main-sequence B-type stars\n(Ghez et al. 2005; Eisenhauer et al. 2005; Martins et al.\n2008). In situ formation is excluded by the inexplicably high pressure required to overcome the strong tidal\nforces, and will also lead to a stellar disk (Ghez et al.\n2005), which cannot account for the random orientation and high eccentricity of the orbits within the\nstars' lifetime (G\u00fcrkan & Hopman 2007).\nThe latter argument also argues against the suggested scenario of an infalling cluster of young stars (Gerhard\n2001), which would moreover require a very high mass\n(Portegies Zwart et al. 2003), or an intermediate-mass\nElectronic address: uloeck@astro.uni-bonn.de\n\nblack hole in its center for it to survive the tidal force of\nSgr A\u2217 (Hansen & Milosavljevi\u0107 2003). Exchange capture with compact remnants (Alexander & Livio 2004)\nonly works with a large cluster of black holes and fails\nto explain the youth and high initial eccentricities. The\nLense-Thirring effect may account for the innermost star\n(Levin & Beloborodov 2003), S2, being dragged out of\nthe disk plane, but cannot explain the orbital orientation of the longer-period S stars, nor the proximity of\nthe orbit itself. Interaction of stars in a central cluster\nwith a fossil accretion disk can lead to high eccentricities\nand orbital decay (\u0160ubr & Karas 2005) if the disk mass\nis sufficiently high, but fails to explain the observed bias\ntoward young B-type stars. Furthermore, such an accretion disk is expected to fragment and form stars and\nshould thus have been observed.\nTidal disruption of binaries falling into the Galactic\ncenter on highly eccentric orbits has been shown to be\nan effective mechanism to create S stars, but until now\nrequired very massive star clusters passing close to Sgr\nA\u2217 (Gould & Quillen 2003) or the presence of a large\nenough population of compact massive perturbers in\ncombination with many young stars on eccentric orbits\n(Perets et al. 2007).\nIn the following we show how the dynamical interaction\nof two stellar disks at larger radii, as they are observed\nin the Galactic center, naturally leads to the creation of\nS stars. Section 2 describes the setup of our numerical\nsimulations. In \u00a7 3, we present the outcome of these\nsimulations, showing how the disk stars can eventually\ngain very high eccentricities. Section 4 explains how binary stars on such eccentric orbits around the SMBH get\ndisrupted, leaving behind an S star and possibly a hypervelocity star. In \u00a7 5 we discuss our results, showing how\nthe mechanism suggested here explains all the observed\nproperties of the S stars.\n2. MODELING DISK INTERACTION\n\nAn extensive analysis of young massive stars in the innermost parsec of our Galaxy shows that almost all stars\n\n\f2\n0 Myr\n5 Myr\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n0.4\nSemi-major axis [pc]\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\nFig. 1.- Aitoff projection of normal vectors of the orbits of stars\nsituated in two interacting disks. The separation of two points\nin the projected plot indicates the relative inclination of the two\ncorresponding stellar orbits, and thus the disk thickness. The red\nsquares indicate the initial state of two nearly flat disks inclined\nat an angle of 130\u25e6 . The orientation of the disks changes with\ntime due to precession. By 5 Myr (circles), the massive disk shows\na slight warping (bottom). The less massive disk (top to left)\nprecesses faster and is affected more strongly by warping, especially\ntowards the inner edge (green and yellow circles), where it loses its\ndisk shape.\n\nreside in two 6 \u00b1 2 Myr old rotating disks-except for the\nS stars in the central arcsecond (Paumard et al. 2006).\nWhile the clockwise disk is very distinct, there is some\ndebate over the disk structure of the counterclockwise\nsystem (Lu et al. 2006). However, Cuadra et al. (2008)\nhave shown that a single stellar disk cannot explain the\nhigh inclinations and eccentricities observed. Using direct N -body calculations as described below, we find that\nthe distribution of eccentricities and inclinations of the\nobserved young stars' orbits is consistent with an initial\nconfiguration of two relatively flat disks, since the less\nmassive disk is destroyed over time due to dynamical interaction (see \u00a7 3).\nTo investigate the stellar dynamical evolution of two\ninteracting stellar disks, we have computed a number of N -body integrations. The parameters of our\nmodel are chosen so as to best fit the observations by\nPaumard et al. (2006) and are as follows: Our model\nconsists of a 3.5 \u00d7 106 M\u2299 SMBH and two flat circular\nstellar disks, mutually inclined at an angle of 130\u25e6 , with a\nsurface density profile that scales with distance as r\u22122.5 .\nThe disks have well-defined initial extents of 0.05\u22120.5 pc\nand 0.07 \u2212 0.5 pc, respectively.\nWe assume that the lower mass limit of the stars observed by Paumard et al. (2006) is 20 M\u2299 . For our models, we assume a disk age of 5 Myr, and hence an upper\ninitial mass limit of 42.5 M\u2299 for the observed disk stars\n(Hurley et al. 2000; Fuchs et al. 2006). Using the initial\nmass function dN/dm \u221d m\u22121.35 as derived from the Kband luminosity function by Paumard et al. (2006) with\nmass limits 1 and 120 M\u2299 , this leads to a total initial\nstellar mass of 10, 380 M\u2299 to explain the 73 observed O\nstars. Allowing for 30% binaries and another 10% for\nstars disrupted by the SMBH or unobserved, and using\na mass ratio of 2 : 1 for the disks, we have initial stellar masses of 9, 900 and 4, 950 M\u2299, respectively. As a\nconsequence, our disks initially consist of 535 and 267\nmultimass stars (and binaries), respectively. The above\nparameters have proven to result in a distribution of eccentricities and semimajor axes as well as an inclination\nbetween the two disks after 5 Myr which best match the\n\nobservations.\nWe used our bhint code (L\u00f6ckmann & Baumgardt\n2008) for the integration, which has been developed\nspecifically to calculate the dynamics of stars orbiting\na SMBH, and includes post-Newtonian treatment up to\norder 2.5 to account for the effects of general relativity. Furthermore, we have added the SSE package by\nHurley et al. (2000) to account for the effects of stellar\nmass loss.\nThe stars and binaries are modeled as point masses,\nand all binaries are assumed to be equal-mass. Tidal\ndisruption is not considered; however, we assume that\nstars on very tight orbits (a < 80 AU) are swallowed by\nthe SMBH. We switch on the post-Newtonian terms for\nthe central motion around the SMBH in our bhint integrator (L\u00f6ckmann & Baumgardt 2008) for eccentricities\ne > 0.9, and switch it off when e falls below 0.8. A fully\npost-Newtonian calculation shows that in the regime considered in this Letter, relativistic effects are negligible\nfor orbits with lower eccentricities within the considered\ntimescale.\nWe finally note that the detailed choice of parameters\nseems not to be too important. A number of models with\nvariations in total mass, mass function, and disk age lead\nto comparable results.\n3. ACHIEVING VERY HIGH ECCENTRICITIES\n\nDue to mutual torques, the two stellar disks described\nabove precess about each other, with a frequency proportional to the other disk's mass: The precession frequency\nof a star orbiting a SMBH of mass MSMBH at radius R at\nan inclination \u03b2 relative to a narrow disk of mass Mdisk at\na radius Rdisk can be approximated as (Nayakshin 2005)\nr\n2\n3 Mdisk\nR3 Rdisk\nGMSMBH\n\u03c9p = \u2212\n.\ncos \u03b2\n2 )5/2\n4 MSMBH\nR3\n(R2 + Rdisk\n(1)\nAs can be seen, the precession frequency depends\nalso on the distance of a star from the central SMBH\n(Nayakshin 2005), and since both disks have a finite extent, stars at different central distances precess with different frequencies, thus warping the originally flat disks.\nIn particular, the innermost stars quickly get inclined\nwith respect to their disk of origin, and so start precessing about both disks. This leads to further thickening\nand deformation of the disks as well as large inclinations.\nFigure 1 depicts the evolution of the stellar disks' shape\nand thickness. Being exposed to the larger torque, the\nless massive disk is warped much faster, explaining why\nthe observed thickness of the less massive disk in the\ncenter of our Galaxy is substantially higher, making its\npresent existence controversial (Lu et al. 2006).\nApart from precession, all stars are subject to the\nKozai mechanism (Kozai 1962): Stars on highly inclined\norbits relative to an axisymmetric perturbation periodically obtain small inclinations, and simultaneously gain\nhigh eccentricities. At their pericenter, stars on orbits\nwith eccentricity e > 0.99 pass the central SMBH within\n\u223c 100 AU, less than the S stars' pericenter distances.\nThe effects of general relativity causes eccentric orbits to\nprecess, which may damp the Kozai mechanism and prevent further growth in eccentricity (Holman et al. 1997).\nHowever, our simulations show that in the presence of\n\n\f3\n1\n\n0.001\n25%\n20%\n15%\n\n1,000\n0.1\n\n1-eouter\n1-einner\naouter\nainner\n\n100\n10\n\n1-e\n\nSemi-major axis [AU]\n\n0.01\n\n0.01\n\n1\n0.1\n\n0.001\n\n10%\n0\n\nemax > 0.9\nemax > 0.99\n\n5%\n0%\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n3\nTime [Myr]\n\n4\n\n5\n\nFig. 2.- Eccentricity evolution of stellar orbits. The top panel\nshows as an example the time evolution of orbital eccentricity of\nthree stars with short Kozai periods. The cyclic nature of the\nKozai mechanism, leading to extremely high eccentricities, is evident. The solid and dotted lines in the bottom panel depict the\nfraction of stars having reached eccentricities higher than 0.9 and\n0.99, respectively, as a function of time. Any star on a Kozai oscillation keeps a high eccentricity for a short time only, but as most\nstars have a Kozai period longer than the computed time, these\nnumbers are increasing until the end of the integration.\n\nvery massive, nearby disks, relativistic effects do not prevent eccentricities as high as e = 0.999.\nFigure 2 shows the eccentricity evolution of some stars\nin our simulation, and the total fraction of stars that\nhave reached eccentric orbits within a given time. A significant fraction of the stars obtain very high eccentricities. In contrast, a single stellar disk around a SMBH\nevolves only very slowly: In a corresponding integration,\nno star obtained an orbital eccentricity above 0.8 within\na comparable time span. This is mainly due to the lack\nof an external torque, and the lack of large inclinations\nrequired for the Kozai mechanism to become effective.\n4. DISRUPTION OF STELLAR BINARIES\n\nAs most stars form in binaries (Goodwin et al. 2007), it\nis natural to assume that a significant fraction of stars in\nthe stellar disks are followed by a companion. The orbits\nof these binaries around the SMBH are subject to the\nsame Kozai mechanism as single stars, but a very close\npericenter passage may break up the binary and leave\none star on a tightly bound orbit around the SMBH.\nIn a set of three-body integrations of a stellar binary\norbiting a SMBH, we have investigated the distribution\nof binary disruption remnants. As can be seen in Figure\n2, the eccentricity evolution due to the Kozai effect is\nsmooth.\nWe calculated a set of models including a SMBH, an\nintermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) to drive the Kozai,\nand a stellar binary on an initially circular orbit at high\ninclination with respect to the IMBH's orbit in order to\ntest the impact of a Kozai oscillation on the binary's\ninner orbital parameters. Figure 3 shows the time evolution of a 0.1 AU binary's both outer and inner eccentricity and semimajor axis. It can be seen that until binary\ndisruption, only the outer eccentricity is changing. In\nparticular, the binary does not widen. Only during the\nlast few pericenter passages does the inner eccentricity\ngrow to a value of e = 0.6, but this does not significantly\nchange the resulting semimajor axis of the bound member, nor the velocity of the ejected star.

It is seen that the binary's inner\norbital parameters stay constant until binary disruption, while the\nouter eccentricity grows due to the Kozai mechanism.\n0.1\n\nSemi-major axis [pc]\n\nFraction of stars\n\n1 - eccentricity\n\n1\n10,000\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n\n0.0001\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\nBinary separation [AU]\n\nFig. 4.- Orbital parameters about the SMBH of the (more\nstrongly) bound member star of a disrupted equal-mass binary as\na function of initial binary separation. While the disruption of wide\nbinaries leaves the individual stars on orbits similar to the initial\ntrajectory, the bound star of a disrupted tight binary ends up on a\nvery tight orbit around the SMBH. The solid line depicts the initial\nsemimajor axis before disruption. The shaded area indicates the\nsemimajor axes of the S stars in the Galactic center.\n\nwith wider binaries (1 AU) yield similar results.\nWe thus conclude that any tight binary undergoing\nKozai resonance reaches its point of disruption basically\nunperturbed. We have therefore computed a set of models where the pericenter distance of a binary orbiting a\nSMBH is equal to the disruption distance (Fig. 4). We\nfind that the disruption remnants of binaries with separations larger than a few AU orbit the central SMBH\non similar trajectories as the initial binary, and so can\nstill be observed as disk stars. However, the disruption\nof a tight binary (with separation of 1 AU or less) forces\none star onto a very tight and eccentric S-star-type orbit,\nwhile the other star gains a significant amount of energy\nand may even be ejected from the Galaxy, thus becoming a progenitor of the hypervelocity stars observed in the\nGalactic halo (e.g., Brown et al. 2007; Gualandris et al.\n2005). For example, disruption of binaries with a separation of 0.2 AU leaves one star on an orbit with semimajor\naxis consistent with those of the observed S stars, while\nthe other star is ejected from the Galaxy with a velocity\nof up to 1000 km s\u22121 in more than half of our integrations.\nBinary disruption has been shown to be an effec-\n\n\f4\ntive mechanism to create the S stars (Gould & Quillen\n2003). One way to create young close-passage binaries\nis by massive perturbers like star clusters or molecular\nclouds at distances of a few pc from the Galactic center\n(Perets et al. 2007). Our simulations show that these binaries are also a natural consequence of the interaction of\nthe two stellar disks: Using a binary fraction of 30%, 18\nof the B-type binaries achieve pericenter distances below their tidal radius, assuming a binary separation of\n0.1 AU. Given that not much is known about the binary\nfraction in the Galactic center, this is fully consistent\nwith the observed number of 15 S stars.\n5. DISCUSSION\n\nThe mechanism described above naturally explains the\nreported mysteries of the S stars: The disruption of stellar binaries as tight as 0.1\u20131 AU can leave a single star\norbiting the central SMBH a factor of 10 closer than the\noriginal binary. This is just the distance ratio of S stars\nand stellar disks observed in the center of our Galaxy.\nThe orientation of the disks rapidly changes due to\nprecession. Furthermore, the change of orientation of\na binary's orbit is a natural consequence of the Kozai\neffect. Once a binary is disrupted and leaves a single star\non a much closer orbit, this orbit is decoupled from the\noriginating stellar disk's motion, as both the precession\nfrequency and the Kozai oscillation period are functions\nof central distance, explaining the widely varying orbital\norientations observed.\nThe eccentricities created for the tightly bound stars\nafter tidal disruption are as high as 0.99. Resonant relaxation (Rauch & Tremaine 1996) and Kozai interactions between the S stars are expected to turn these extremely high eccentricities into an isotropic distribution\non a short timescale, just as is observed for the S stars.\nWhile all of the S stars observed so far are mainsequence B-type stars, observations of the stellar disks\nin the Galactic center mostly revealed OB giants and\n\nWolf-Rayet stars. But even for the unusually flat mass\nfunction suggested (Paumard et al. 2006), one would expect a factor of 5 more B-type main-sequence stars in the\ndisks than O stars. Most of these stars have not been\nobserved yet, mainly due to crowding of the observed region, limited spatial resolution, and strong nebular emission (Paumard et al. 2006). Our computation assuming\nequal-mass binaries predicts only one S star above 20 M\u2299\nper 18 B-type S stars. The lack of observed O-type S\nstars is therefore not statistically significant. The number of expected massive S stars would drop further for\nrandom pairing of binary component masses, since disruption of a high mass ratio binary will only moderately\nchange the orbit of the massive member. Furthermore,\nthe massive O stars might not form in as tight binaries\nas are required to produce S stars. Hence, it is legitimate to assume that both S stars and disk stars formed\nin the same environment, thus providing a solution to\nthe \"paradox of youth\".\nIn this Letter, we studied the evolution of two isolated stellar disks orbiting a SMBH. In a forthcoming\npublication, we will analyze the effects of other contributions of a perturbing potential, such as a stellar cusp (e.g., Sch\u00f6del et al. 2007), a massive circumnuclear disk (Christopher et al. 2005), an intermediatemass black hole and/or a star cluster (probably IRS 13;\nMaillard et al. 2004). Preliminary results indicate, e.g.,\nthat the presence of a cusp of stellar black holes (e.g.,\nFreitag et al. 2006) does not prevent the dynamical formation of S stars as described in this Letter.\n\nWe thank Ladislav \u0160ubr for helpful discussions.
