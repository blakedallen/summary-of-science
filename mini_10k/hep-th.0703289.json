INTRODUCTION\n\nThe geometric transition between conifold geometries is an example of a string theory duality between compactifications on different geometrical backgrounds.\nInitial arguments came from two different angles: a generalisation of AdS/CFT via the\nKlebanov and Strassler (2000) model and independently\nas a duality between open and closed topological\nstrings by Gopakumar and Vafa (1999).\nA common embedding has since been found in IIB, IIA\nand M-theory (Atiyah et al., 2001; Cachazo et al., 2001;\nDasgupta et al., 2001, 2002b; Vafa, 2001) and the geometric transition has been confirmed on the supergravity\nlevel (Alexander et al., 2005; Becker et al., 2006, 2004;\nDasgupta et al., 2006; Knauf, 2007). It is the intention\nof this article to give a comprehensive overview of the different ideas underlying geometric transitions and review\nbriefly the lengthy supergravity calculations of the latter\nreferences.\n\nThe model of Klebanov and Strassler is based\non a series of papers (Gubser and Klebanov, 1998;\nKlebanov and Nekrasov, 2000; Klebanov and Tseytlin,\n2000; Klebanov and Witten, 1998) generalising the\nAdS/CFT\ncorrespondence\n(Gubser et al.,\n1998;\nMaldacena, 1998; Witten, 1998).\nInstead of the\nN = 4 superconformal field theory one obtains from\nconsidering AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 , theories with less supersymmetry\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: gwynr, knauf@physics.mcgill.ca\n\ncan be found by taking AdS5 \u00d7 M 5 , where M 5 is some\nfive-dimensional manifold. One can break conformal\ninvariance by introducing fractional D3-branes instead of\n(only) D3-branes. These are objects that wrap compact\ncycles in the internal manifold and therefore appear\neffectively three dimensional. Once conformal invariance\nis broken, the gauge theory exhibits a running coupling.\nThe coupling constant is related to the NS-NS B-field\nin the string theory dual. One approaches the far IR\nlimit of the gauge theory as the radial co-ordinate in\nthe supergravity dual approaches zero. The manifold\nM5 considered in this model is the base of a conifold, so\nthere is a singularity at r = 0. This does not mean that\nthe far IR limit of the gauge theory is not well defined.\nOn the contrary, knowledge about the strong-coupling\nbehaviour of the dual Super\u2013Yang\u2013Mills theory led\nKlebanov and Strassler to the following remarkable\nconclusion: since SYM exhibits gaugino condensation\nand chiral symmetry breaking (which breaks the U (1)\nsymmetry down to Z2 ) in the far IR, the dual string\ntheory background has to be modified for r \u2192 0, in\norder to reflect this symmetry property. The singularity\nis smoothed out, giving a manifold which looks like the\nconifold at large radial distances, but approaches a finite\nthree-sphere at the tip of the cone. This manifold is\ncalled the \"deformed conifold\" and has precisely the\nrequired symmetry property, i.e. it is only invariant\nunder Z2 , where the (singular) conifold was invariant\nunder a full U (1). We summarise this picture in Figure\n1.\nGopakumar and Vafa (1999) also considered conifold\ngeometries, but they were interested in topological string\namplitudes. They showed that the open A-model on the\ndeformed conifold (with a blown-up S 3 ) agrees with the\n\n\f2\nString theory\n\nGauge theory\n\nN D3 branes at tip\nM wrapped D5s\nSingular conifold\nNSNS & RR fluxes\n\n(3+1) D N = 1\nSU(N) x SU(N+M)\n\nUV picture\n\nRG flow: Seiberg duality cascade\ncoupling constant given by size\nof dilaton and NSNS flux\n\nM fractional D3s\nSingular conifold\nNSNS & RR fluxes\n\n(3+1) D N=1 SU(M)\n\nIR picture\n\nchiral symmetry breaking\n\nDeformed conifold\nNSNS & RR fluxes\n\nFar IR\n\nGaugino\ncondensate\n\nBranes?\n\nFIG. 1 The Klebanov-Strassler model\n\nString theory\n\nN D3branes at tip\nM D5s on finite 2\u2212cycle\nResolved conifold\nNSNS & RR fluxes\n\nGauge theory\n\n(5+1) D N = 1 SU(N)\n\nUV picture\n\nRG flow: infinite series of flops\ncoupling constant given by size\nof 2\u2212cycle and NSNS flux\n\nM fractional D3s\nResolved conifold\nNSNS & RR fluxes\n\n(3+1) D N=1 SU(M)\n\nIR picture\n\nopen/closed\ntopological strings\n\nDeformed conifold\nNSNS & RR fluxes\nNo branes\n\nFIG. 2 Vafa's model\n\nGaugino\ncondensate\n\nFar IR\n\n\f3\nclosed A-model on the resolved conifold (with a blown-up\nS 2 ) on the level of topological string partition functions.\nOne has to identify the correct parameters from each theory: roughly speaking the size of the three-cycle in the\ndeformed geometry (its complex structure modulus) is\nidentified with the size of the two-cycle in the resolved\ngeometry (its K\u00e4hler modulus). Via mirror symmetry,\nthe same can be said for the B-model, but here the roles\nof deformed and resolved conifold are exchanged. The\nconnection to the KS model becomes apparent if one embeds this B-model into IIB superstring theory, as done by\nVafa (2001). Before the geometric transition, D5-branes\nwrap the non-vanishing two-cycle in the resolved conifold\nand appear as fractional D3-branes that carry an N = 1\nSU (N ) SYM.\nThis seems to be precisely the picture one finds at\nthe \"bottom of the duality cascade\" in the KS model:\nfor the model with N D3 and M fractional D3-branes\nthe gauge group is SU (N ) \u00d7 SU (N + M ) and the RG\nflow is such that one of the theories flows towards strong\nand the other towards weak coupling. This translates\nvia Seiberg duality to an SU (N \u2212 M ) \u00d7 SU (N ) theory,\nwhere the two gauge group factors now exhibit the opposite running coupling behaviour. Ergo, one can follow\na \"cascade\" of such Seiberg dualities, where in each step\nthe gauge group factor drops by M . If N is a multiple\nof M (we will discuss the more general case in section\nII.A.2) all the regular D3-branes will \"cascade away\" and\nthe gauge group becomes SU (M ), like in the Vafa setup. The only difference is that Vafa considers a resolved\nconifold, whereas KS started with the singular version.\nNevertheless, the picture they both find in the IR is very\nsimilar: Vafa also argues that in the large M limit the\nstring theory background is rather given by a deformed\nconifold. He gives an even more concise description of\nthis picture: since the topological string argument was\nbased on an open/closed duality, there is no equivalent\nfor the D-branes in the dual closed theory. The geometric transition conjectured by Vafa is therefore a duality between a background with D-branes (on which the\ngauge degrees of freedom propagate) and a background\nwith only fluxes (where a geometrical parameter enters\ninto the flux-generated superpotential to give the correct\nconfining IR behaviour). We therefore conclude that the\nD-branes in the KS model should also disappear once the\nsingular conifold is traded against its deformation \u2013 see\nFigure 2 for comparison.\nAll the transitions discussed so far take either the singular or resolved conifold to the deformed conifold by\nblowing up a non-trivial two-cycle. Thus what we have\nreally been discussing is the \"conifold transition\". As all\nconifold geometries are cones over S 2 \u00d7 S 3 , this can be\npictured as depicted in Figure 3.\nGeneralisations could be imagined for other manifolds\nthat allow for non-trivial two- and three-cycles. In fact,\nwhen trying to confirm Vafa's picture on the supergravity level, we immediately encountered generalisations of\nthe conifold (Becker et al., 2004). These come about be-\n\nFIG. 3 The conifold transition. All three geometries share\nthe base S 2 \u00d7 S 3 , but the S 3 of the deformed conifold (left)\nremains finite. In the conifold transition it can be shrunk to\nzero size to give the singular conifold (centre), from which\nblowing up the S 2 gives the resolved conifold (right).\n\ncause under T-duality the original geometry attains a\ntwisting of its fibration structure by the B-field. The\nresulting manifold is therefore non-K\u00e4hler and we will\nreview its construction in Section III.C. The B-field is\na key ingredient in the Vafa and KS model, as its radial\ndependence is what gives rise to the running coupling\n(Klebanov and Nekrasov, 2000). It cannot be avoided\nwhen introducing fractional D3-branes. Therefore, either\nthe IIA or IIB embedding of the geometric transition will\nhave such a B-field and its mirror (or T-dual) will be nonK\u00e4hler.\nThe outline of this article is as follows. In Section II we\nwill review the Klebanov\u2013Strassler and the Gopakumar\u2013\nVafa models. Section II.A explains in great detail the\ngauge theory duals of regular and fractional D3-branes,\nas well as the duality cascade and the singularity resolution via chiral symmetry breaking. The discussion of\nGopakumar and Vafa's model, Section II.B, starts with a\nshort review of topological string theory and states their\nconjecture. References are provided for the detailed calculations, as they alone would fill an entire article. We\ndo, however, discuss the embedding of the open/closed\nduality into superstring theory and review the derivation\nof the flux-generated superpotential in Section II.C. The\nIIB and IIA pictures can be connected to an M-theory\nbackground in which the geometric transition manifests\nitself as a flop; this is what we call Vafa's duality chain\nin Section II.C.2. Both IIB models, the KS and the Vafa\nmodel, have an intuitive description in T-dual IIA theory,\nwhere the conifold background turns into a pair of NS5branes. This picture is useful for observing the gauge\ntheory construction and the unification of the geometric transition with the cascading solution in M-theory\n(Dasgupta et al., 2001, 2002a,b). We review the arguments in Section II.D before we finally turn to summarising the supergravity analysis of the duality chain in Section III. We walk the reader through the main steps, as\nthere appear some non-trivial issues along the way, but\nwe try to be as non-technical as possible.\nAn extensive appendix summarises known facts about\nconifold geometries. In Appendix A.4 we give the choice\nof complex structures that make all three conifold metrics Ricci flat and K\u00e4hler and we use this knowledge in\nAppendix A.5 to evaluate the supersymmetry require-\n\n\f4\nN D3 branes\n\nments for known supergravity solutions for fractional D3branes on conifold geometries. We agree with earlier results of Cvetic et al. (2003) that the KS model on the\nsingular conifold preserves supersymmetry, whereas the\nPando Zayas and Tseytlin (2000) solution for D5-branes\nwrapped on the resolution of the conifold does not.\nII.

The D3-branes sit at\nthe singular point of the conifold, while the fractional\nbranes arise from wrapping M D5-branes on the vanishing two-cycle of the conifold. The gauge theory living on\nthe branes is non-conformal, and in the IR is given by an\nSU (M ) theory which exhibits chiral symmetry breaking\nand gaugino condensation, suggesting that the correct\ndual of the gauge theory in the IR limit is a deformed\nconifold. In this section we review the argument for this\nduality from the Klebanov-Strassler model. We begin by\nconstructing the gauge theory of the Klebanov-Witten\nmodel in which no fractional branes are present and\nthe gauge theory is conformal, and then proceed to the\nnon-conformal case corresponding to the presence of\nwrapped D5-branes.\n\nFirst\nconsider\nthe\nKlebanov\u2013Witten\nmodel\n(Klebanov and Witten, 1998) in which a stack of\nD3-branes is placed at the tip of a conifold (see Figure\n4 (a)). As in the original scenario of the AdS/CFT\nconjecture, we expect a duality between the gauge\ntheory living on the branes and the gravity theory, found\nby taking the near-horizon limit. The near-horizon\ngeometry in this case is AdS5 \u00d7 T 1,1 where T 1,1 is the\nbase of the conifold, a Sasaki-Einstein manifold. The\nreader not familiar with conifold geometries might wish\nto consult Appendix A for more details. It is the coset\nspace (SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2))/U (1) and has topology S 2 \u00d7 S 3\n(as depicted in Figure 3). The metric of T 1,1 was found\nby Candelas and de la Ossa (1990) and is given by\n1\n(d\u03c8 + cos \u03b81 d\u03c61 + cos \u03b82 d\u03c62 )2\n9\n1 X\n(d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8i d\u03c62i ),\n+\n6 i=1,2 i\n\n(b) The Klebanov\u2212Strassler model\nFIG. 4 Comparing the Klebanov-Witten and KlebanovStrassler set-ups.\n\n\u0001\n1\n1\nds2 = H \u2212 2 (r)ds20123 + H 2 (r) dr2 + r2 d\u03a32T 1,1 (2.3)\n4\n\nand is nonsingular everywhere since H(r) = 1 + Lr4 with\nL4 = 4\u03c0gS N (\u03b1\u2032 )2 .\nWe would like to study the gauge theory living on the\nD3-branes. To do this we will use the symmetries of the\nconifold to find a convenient set of co-ordinates that can\nbe promoted to fields. We will thus construct a gauge\ntheory with exactly the conifold symmetries, and find the\ncorrect gauge theory on the branes by adding first one Dbrane and then generalising to the case where there is a\nstack of N D3-branes on the conifold tip. We begin by\nrewriting the defining equation for the conifold (A.2),\n\n(2.1)\n\nz12 + z22 + z32 + z42 = 0,\n\nz i \u2208 C4\n\n(2.4)\n\nas\n\nso that the metric on the (singular) conifold is\nds2 = dr2 + r2 d\u03a32T 1,1 .\n\nM wrapped D5 branes\n\nfor the configuration of N D3-branes at the tip is given\nby\n\n1. The Klebanov\u2013Witten Model\n\nd\u03a32T 1,1 =\n\nN D3 branes\n\ndet Zij = 0,\n(2.2)\n\nThe conifold is a non-compact Calabi-Yau. Note that although the conifold is singular, the supergravity solution\n\n(2.5)\n\nP n\nwhere Zij = \u221a12 n \u03c3ij\nzn , with \u03c3 n the Pauli matrices\nfor n = 1, 2, 3 and \u03c3 4 = \u01311. The defining equation for\n\n\f5\nthe conifold is now det Z = 0, where we have a choice of\nco-ordinates1\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nz3 + \u0131z4 z1 \u2212 \u0131z2\nA1 B1 A1 B2\nZ =\n=\n(2.6)\nz1 + \u0131z2 \u2212z3 + \u0131z4\nA2 B1 A2 B2\nAs explained in more detail in Appendix A.1, the conifold is invariant under SO(4) \u2248 SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) where\nSO(4) acts on the zi in (2.4) and the SU (2)s act on the i\nand j indices in (2.5), respectively. In addition, there is a\nU (1) symmetry under which all the zi in (2.4) are rotated\nby the same phase. It is easy to see that the metric (2.1)\npossesses the same symmetries. Each SU (2) acts on one\n{\u03b8i , \u03c6i , \u03c8i } (where \u03c8 in (2.1) is given by \u03c81 \u2212\u03c82 ) while the\nU (1) symmetry corresponds to invariance under shifts in\n\u03c8. To find the gauge theory we will consider D3-branes\non this space and study the low-energy field theory of the\nmodes localised on the brane. The moduli space of vacua\nof this theory should be exactly N copies of the manifold\n- in this case the conifold - modulo the action of the permutation group (since the D3-branes are identical). The\nglobal symmetry group of the gauge theory living on the\nD3-branes will therefore be SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1).\nThe co-ordinates Ai and Bj , i, j = 1, 2 give a useful\nparametrisation of the conifold. The Ai are rotated into\neach other under one SU (2) and the Bj transform under\nthe other. As they stand, these co-ordinates represent 8\nreal degrees of freedom. However, in describing the conifold using A1 , A2 , B1 and B2 we have invariance under\nAi \u2192 \u03bbAi ,\n1\nBj \u2192 Bj .\n\u03bb\n\n\u03bb\u2208C\n\n(2.7)\n\n(2.8)\n\nThis removes one degree of freedom.2 To fix the phase,\nwe have to divide by U (1), which means we make the\nidentifications\nAi \u223c e\u0131\u03b1 Ai ,\nBj \u223c e\u2212\u0131\u03b1 Bj ,\n\n(2.9)\n\nleaving 6 degrees of freedom. In other words no more\nconditions are required in order for these co-ordinates to\ngive a complete description of the conifold. Thus we have\narrived at a description of the conifold given by the 4\nco-ordinates Ai , Bj and the magnitude constraint (2.8),\nsubject to the identifications (2.9). This description is\nequivalent to the equation of the conifold given by (2.5).\n\n1\n\n2\n\nW = \u03bb det(\u00c3i B\u0303j )\n\nThe main references for this section are (Klebanov and Witten,\n1998), (Klebanov and Strassler, 2000) and (Strassler, 2005). A\nrecent useful reference is (Klebanov and Murugan, 2007).\nIt's then further dividing by the scale invariance that one obtains\nthe base, see (A.4).\n\n(2.10)\n\n= \u03bb(\u00c31 B\u03031 \u00c32 B\u03032 \u2212 \u00c31 B\u03032 \u00c32 B\u03031 ),\nwhich preserves SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1)R . The D-term\ncondition for supersymmetry is given by D = 0, where\ni\n1 Xh\nD = \u2212\nq\u00c3i \u00c3\u2217i \u00c3i + qB\u0303i B\u0303i\u2217 B\u0303i + \u03be, (2.11)\n2 i\n\u03be being the coefficient of the Fayet-Iliopoulos term and\nqi being the U (1) charge of the relevant field. When \u03be\nis zero3 this is exactly our conifold constraint (2.8). The\nmoduli space of vacua is found by furthermore dividing\nby the gauge group U (1) which is equivalent to imposing\n(2.9). Now we claim that for a single D3-brane on a\nconifold, the gauge theory whose moduli space exactly\nmatches the conifold is in fact given by a gauge group\nU (1) \u00d7 U (1), so the fields now have charges (1, \u22121) and\n(\u22121, 1), respectively, under the two U (1) groups. The\ntwo D-term conditions (one for each U (1)) both yield the\nrelation (2.8). The superpotential (2.10) is unchanged\nand zero, so there are no F-term conditions\nFi = \u2212\n\nWe fix the magnitude and phase of \u03bb separately. To fix\nthe magnitude, impose\n|A1 |2 + |A2 |2 \u2212 |B1 |2 \u2212 |B2 |2 = 0.\n\nNext we turn to the gauge theory. We can formulate\nthe field theory in terms of Ai and Bi because they have\nthe symmetries we want; we promote them to chiral superfields. Consider then an N = 1 supersymmetric theory with U (1) gauge group and chiral superfields \u00c3i , B\u0303j\nwith i, j = 1, 2, such that the \u00c3i have charge 1 and the\nB\u0303j have charge -1. The superpotential is given by\n\n\u2202W\n= 0,\n\u2202 \u00c3i\n\nand this theory's moduli space is the conifold.\nWhen we place instead of a single brane a stack of\nN D3-branes on the conifold, the gauge group becomes4\nSU (N )\u00d7SU (N ) so the superpotential no longer vanishes.\nIt is given by\nW = \u03bbtr det(\u00c3i B\u0303j ),\n\n(2.12)\n\nwhere the trace is now necessary because the superfields\ncarry a gauge index for each U (N ) and should therefore\nbe treated as matrices. The \u00c3 and B\u0303 fields are now bifundamental fields transforming in the (N, N ) and (N , N )\nrepresentations of the gauge groups, respectively. Together with the D-term conditions and the gauge invariance they give a description of the moduli space which\nmatches the description of the conifold in terms of A and\nB arrived at above. The F-term equations\nB\u03031 \u00c3i B\u03032 \u2212 B\u03032 \u00c3i B\u03031 = 0,\n\n(2.13)\n\n\u00c31 B\u0303j \u00c32 \u2212 \u00c32 B\u0303j \u00c31 = 0,\n\n3\n4\n\nIn fact \u03be 6= 0 corresponds to a resolved conifold, as discussed in\nmore detail in Klebanov and Murugan (2007).\nActually it is U (N ) \u00d7 U (N ) but the U (1) factors decouple in the\nIR.\n\n\f6\ntogether with the D-term conditions (2.11), can be shown\nto have a solution if and only if \u00c3 and B\u0303 can be\nsimultaneously diagonalised (Strassler, 2005). In this\ncase the superpotential vanishes, giving exactly (2.5).\nThe theory flows to a non-trivial infrared fixed point\n(Klebanov and Witten, 1998). We have seen how the\nsymmetry group SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) acts on Ai , Bj .\nThe U (1) global symmetry of the conifold manifests as\nwhat is called a U (1)R symmetry in the gauge theory,\nunder which\n(Ai , Bj ) \u2212\u2192 eR\u03b1 (Ai , Bj ).\n\n(2.14)\n\nThe R-charges of the fields Ai and Bj are found by imposing conformal invariance5 and are equal to 1/2. This\nleads to an R-charge of 2 for the superpotential, as required. The extra U (1) symmetry expressed in (2.9) is\nreferred to in the gauge theory as baryonic symmetry.\n2. The duality cascade\n\nHaving discussed the Klebanov-Witten model in detail,\nwe are now in a position to study the Klebanov-Strassler\nmodel (Klebanov and Strassler, 2000). As shown in Figure 4(b), the difference between the two set-ups is that in\nthe configuration considered by Klebanov and Strassler\nthere are M D5-branes wrapping the vanishing 2-cycle of\nthe conifold. These are effectively D3-branes with fractional charge, called fractional branes. Their effect is to\nrender the dual gauge theory non-conformal, with many\ninteresting consequences.\nThis set-up was studied by Gubser and Klebanov\n(1998) and Klebanov and Nekrasov (2000), where the\nrunning of the gauge coupling was found. An exact solution, including backreactions, was set out in\nKlebanov and Tseytlin (2000), but the details of the duality cascade, chiral symmetry breaking and confinement\nwere elucidated in Klebanov and Strassler (2000), which\nwe follow closely here. A comprehensive review is given\nby Strassler (2005).\nConsider first the gravity theory. The fractional branes\nare magnetic sources for the three-form field strength (F3\nis the Hodge dual of F7 = dC6 )\nF3 = M \u03c93 ,\n\n(2.15)\n\nwhere\n\u03c93 =\n\n5\n\n1\nd\u03c8 \u2227 (sin \u03b81 d\u03b81 \u2227 d\u03c61 \u2212 sin \u03b82 d\u03b82 \u2227 d\u03c62 ) (2.16)\n2\n1\n+ d\u03c61 \u2227 d\u03c62 \u2227 (cos \u03b81 sin \u03b82 d\u03b82 + sin \u03b81 cos \u03b82 d\u03b81 )\n2\n\nSetting the \u03b2-functions equal to zero yields anomalous dimensions -1/2 for the fields, and one can make use of the relation\ndimO = 1 + 12 \u03b3O = 3R2O for an operator O to solve for the\nR-charges.\n\nis the 3-form dual to the non-trivial 3-cycle of the conifold. In addition there are N units of five-form flux due to\nthe D3-branes, but the total five-form RR field strength\nalso has a contribution from the NS-NS B-field, which is\nnecessarily present in the supergravity solution:\nF\u03035 = dC4 + B2 \u2227 F3 ,\n\u0012 \u0013\nr\n.\nB2 = 3gs M \u03c92 ln\nr0\n\n(2.17)\n(2.18)\n\nHere \u03c92 = 12 (sin \u03b81 d\u03b81 \u2227 d\u03c61 \u2212 sin \u03b82 d\u03b82 \u2227 d\u03c62 ) is the 2form on the 2-cycle wrapped by the D5s and r0 is some\nUV scale.\nFrom the gauge theory point of view, the presence of\nthe M fractional branes changes the gauge group6 from\nSU (N ) \u00d7 SU (N ) to SU (N + M ) \u00d7 SU (N ). The field\ncontent is still given by four chiral superfields Ai and Bj ,\nwhile the superpotential is given by (2.12). However, the\nrelative gauge coupling depends on B2 and therefore on r\n(Klebanov and Nekrasov, 2000; Klebanov and Tseytlin,\n2000):\n\u0015\n\u0014Z\n1\n1\n1\n1\n.\n(2.19)\n\u2212\n\u223c\nB\n\u2212\n2\ng12\ng22\ngs S 2\n2\nAccording to the usual AdS/CFT dictionary, r maps to\nthe RG scale in the dual gauge theory. Thus this theory\nis no longer conformal.\nThe gauge couplings g12 and g12 flow in opposite direc1\n2\ntions. Facing a divergence in one we can continue by performing a Seiberg duality transformation (Seiberg, 1995),\nunder which we obtain an SU (N ) \u00d7 SU (N \u2212 M ) theory\nwhich resembles closely the theory we started with. We\ncan see this by noting the running of the five-form flux\nunder which the D3-branes are charged (2.17). Since C4\nis oriented along the worldvolume of the D3-branes in the\n0123-directions, we can write the self-dual five-form\nF\u03035 = F5 + \u22c6F5\nin terms of\nF5 = N (r)vol(T 1,1 ) .\nHere we used \u03c92 \u2227 \u03c93 \u223c vol(T 1,1 ) and defined\n\u0012 \u0013\nr\n3\n.\ngs M 2 ln\nN (r) = N +\n2\u03c0\nr0\nSo the number of colours in the theory has become a\nscale-dependent quantity. N (r) will decrease in units of\nM , i.e. the running gives rise to a flow under which\nSU (N + M ) \u00d7 SU (N ) \u2192 SU (N ) \u00d7 SU (N \u2212 M ). This\n\n6\n\nSee Gubser and Klebanov (1998); Klebanov and Nekrasov\n(2000) and Klebanov and Tseytlin (2000). An easy way to\nunderstand this generalisation is given in the brane construction\ndiscussion in Section II.D.\n\n\f7\nprocess will continue until the gauge group is SU (2M ) \u00d7\nSU (M ) or just SU (M ), corresponding to a situation in\nwhich only the M fractional D3-branes remain \u2013 the fiveform flux has decreased to zero indicating that the N\nD3-branes have \"cascaded away\". The process is called\na duality cascade, since the SU (N ) and SU (N \u2212 M )\ntheories are related by a Seiberg duality (Seiberg, 1995).\n3. Chiral symmetry breaking and deformation of the conifold\n\nWhen N \u2212 kM approaches zero we should do a more\ncareful analysis; the cascade must stop because negative\nN is physically nonsensical. At sufficiently small r the\nsolution becomes singular. By studying the far IR of\nthe gauge theory, Klebanov and Strassler argued that\nthis singularity is removed by the IR dynamics, via a\ngluino condensate which breaks the anomaly-free Z2M\nR-symmetry in the theory to Z2 . The expectation value\nacquired by the gaugino condensate maps to the deformation parameter of the conifold: \u03bc in (A.15). Thus the\nsingularity is removed in the gravity picture by blowing\nup the S 3 of T 1,1 .\nAlthough the metric of the KS set-up has a continuous U (1)R symmetry, the full SUGRA solution is only\ninvariant under a Z2M subgroup of this, under which\n(Ai , Bj ) \u2192 (Ai , Bj )e\n\n2\u03c0\u0131n\n4M\n\nWL\n\n2\u039b3M+1\n= \u03bbNij Nkl \u01eb \u01eb + (M \u2212 1)\nNij Nkl \u01ebik \u01ebjl\n\n\u0015 M1\u22121\n\nto which the only solutions for a supersymmetric vacuum\nare\nNij Nkl \u01ebik \u01ebjl\n\n\u0001M\n\n=\n\n2\u039b3M+1\n.\n\u03bbM\u22121\n\n\u039b3M+1\n(2\u03bb)M\u22121\n\n\u0013 M1\n\n.\n\n(2.22)\n\nThus the probe brane moves not on the singular but on\nthe deformed conifold, where the deformation is given\nby the gaugino condensate responsible for chiral symmetry breaking. It is the deformed conifold which gives the\ncorrect moduli for the field theory and which is the correct background geometry for the SUGRA solution that\nis dual to the gauge theory in the far IR.\nIt has been pointed out by Gubser et al. (2004) that\nthe IR of the KS background should really be thought\nof as the next\u2013to\u2013last step of the cascade. Studying the\nfield theory dual to this SU (2M )\u00d7SU (M ) one finds that\nbaryonic operators, instead of mesonic ones as for mobile\nD3\u2013branes, acquire a vev. This background is therefore\nsaid to lie on the baryonic branch.\nB. Open/Closed duality\n\n2\u03c0\u0131n\n\n\u0014\n\ndet Nij =\n\n\u0012\n\n(2.20)\n\nand the superpotential rotates by e M .\nThe theory has a moduli space with M independent\nbranches in the IR. To see this, we probe the space with\na single additional D3-brane. Since in the far IR the\nfive-form field strength has cascaded to zero and only\nthe M fractional D3-branes remain, the gauge group is\nSU (M + 1) \u00d7 SU (1) or SU (M + 1). The fields are Ai and\nBj , i, j = 1, 2, in the M + 1 and M + 1 representations,\nand the superpotential is of the form of (2.12). We can\nwrite this in terms of the gauge invariant Nij = Ai Bj ,\nwhich one can think of as a meson.\nAt low energy the theory is described by the Affleck\u2013\nDine\u2013Seiberg superpotential (Affleck et al., 1984)\nik jl\n\nII.A.1 in which we promoted our co-ordinates to chiral superfields. We can now go the other way, using Nij to find\na co-ordinate description of the geometry in terms of the\ngauge theory fields. In the classical theory, det Nij = 0,\nwhich should be compared to (2.5). In this case the probe\nbrane is moving on the singular conifold. However, as we\nhave seen, in the Klebanov-Strassler model the field theory in the IR gives\n\nA different perspective on geometric transitions comes\nfrom topological string theory. Gopakumar and Vafa\n(1999) conjectured a duality between an open and a\nclosed topological string theory that live on different\nbackgrounds. The connection to the Klebanov\u2013Strassler\nmodel became apparent after Vafa (2001) embedded\nthis duality into superstring theory. We will only review the arguments and refer the reader to the original work (Bershadsky et al., 1994; Gopakumar and Vafa,\n1999; Vafa, 2001) or the reviews (Auckly and Koshkin,\n2007; Neitzke and Vafa, 2004) for details. The purpose\nof Section II.B.1 is to define topological string amplitudes and explain the difference between open and closed\ntopological string theories. The reader familiar with\ntopological string theory may want to skip ahead to the\nGopakumar\u2013Vafa conjecture explained in Section II.B.2.\n1. Topological Sigma Models and String Theory\n\n(2.21)\n\nIn other words, the theory in the far IR has a\nmoduli space with M independent branches.\nThe\nZ2M R-symmetry permutes these branches, rotating\nNij Nkl \u01ebik \u01ebjl by e2\u03c0\u0131M , so the R-symmetry is spontaneously broken from Z2M to Z2 . Thus the gaugino condensate is responsible for the chiral symmetry breaking.\nTo see how this symmetry breaking smooths out the singularity in the IR, we should remind ourselves of Section\n\nThroughout this section we will restrict ourselves to\nthe case H3 = 0. We will closely follow the review Neitzke and Vafa (2004), see e.g. Eguchi and Yang\n(1990); Witten (1988a,b) and Marino (2005) for details.\nString theory is intrinsically linked to sigma models. We can view string theory as the description of a\ntwo-dimensional worldsheet \u03a3 propagating through a 10dimensional target space M . The sigma model that describes this theory deals with maps \u03c6 : \u03a3 \u2192 M . These\n\n\f8\nmaps can be promoted to chiral superfields \u03a6 that have \u03c6\nin their lowest component and obey the 2d sigma model\naction\nZ\n1\nd\u03c4 d\u03c3 d2 \u03b8 (gij (\u03a6) + Bij (\u03a6)) D\u03b1 \u03a6i D\u03b1 \u03a6j ,\nS = \u2212\n4\n(2.23)\nwith indices i, j = 1, ..., d parametrising the target space\nand\nD\u03b1 =\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03b8\n\n\u03b1\n\n+ i\u03c1\u03bc \u03b8\u03b1 \u2202\u03bc ,\n\n(2.24)\n\nwhere \u03c1\u03bc is a 2d \u03b3-matrix and \u03b8\u03b1 a two-component\nGrassmann-valued spinor. Chiral superfields are defined\n\u03b1\nby D \u03a6i = 0. Written in terms of N = 1 superfields,\nthis action has explicit N = 1 supersymmetry. In the\ncase H = dB = 0 it has further non-manifest supersymmetry if and only if the target space is K\u00e4hler (Zumino,\n1979).\nConsidering a sigma model that does contains not only\nchiral but also twisted chiral superfields, one can find\nadditional supersymmetry with H 6= 0 even if the target is not K\u00e4hler. This was proposed by Gates et al.\n(1984) more than twenty years ago and has recently\nfound an embedding in generalised complex geometry (Hitchin, 2003).\nIt turns out that the target\nmanifolds in this model define a (twisted) generalised\nK\u00e4hler structure (Gualtieri, 2003). Stimulated by this\nnew mathematical language, there has been tremendous progress in defining generalised (topological) sigma\nmodels (Bredthauer et al., 2006; Kapustin and Li, 2004;\nLindstrom et al., 2005, 2007; Pestun, 2006), but we will\nnot discuss this direction any further.\nTopological string theory integrates not only over all\nmaps \u03c6 but also over all metrics on \u03a3; this is often called\na sigma model coupled to two-dimensional gravity. Classically, the sigma model action depends only on the conformal class of the metric, so the integral over metrics\nreduces to an integral over conformal (or complex) structures on \u03a3.\nThe sigma model (2.23) with K\u00e4hler target can\nbe made topological by a procedure called \"twisting\"\n(Witten, 1988b), which basically shifts the spin of all\noperators by 1/2 their R-charge. There are two conserved supercurrents for the two worldsheet supersymmetries that are nilpotent\n\u00b1 2\n\n(G ) = 0 ,\n\n(2.25)\n\nso one might be tempted to use these as BRST operators\nand build cohomologies of states. But they have spin\n3/2. The twist shifts their spin by half their R-charge to\nobtain spin 1 operators:\nSnew = Sold +\n\n1\nq,\n2\n\n(2.26)\n\nwhere q is the U (1) R-charge of the operator in question.\nClassically, the theory has a vector U (1)V symmetry and\nan axial U (1)A symmetry. Twisting by U (1)V gives the\n\nso-called A-model; twisting by U (1)A the B-model. The\nU (1)A might suffer from an anomaly unless c1 (M ) = 0,\nwhich leads to the requirement that the target must be\na Calabi\u2013Yau manifold for the B-model. One could now\ndefine Q = G+ or Q = G\u2212 and use this nilpotent operator as a BRST operator, i.e. restrict one's attention to\nobservables which are annihilated by Q.\nBefore doing so let us note a special feature of N =\n(2, 2) supersymmetry. Since left and right movers basically decouple, we can split any of the operators G\u00b1\ninto two commuting copies, one for left and one for right\nmovers. In terms of complex co-ordinates let us denote\nthe left movers as holomorphic G\u00b1 and the right movers\nas antiholomorphic G\u00b1 . This makes the (2,2) supersymmetry more apparent. Now twisting can be defined for\nleft and right movers independently and we obtain in\nprinciple four models, depending on which we choose as\nBRST operators:\n+\n\nB model : (G+ , G ),\n\n\u2212\n\nB\u0304 model : (G\u2212 , G ) .\n\nA model :\n\n(G+ , G ) ,\n\n\u0100 model :\n\n(G\u2212 , G ) ,\n\n\u2212\n\n+\n\nOf these four models, only two are actually independent,\nsince the correlators for A (B) and for \u0100 (B\u0304) are related\nby complex conjugation. So we will ignore \u0100 and B\u0304 in\nthe following.\nStarting with this set-up, one can now discuss observables in topological theories. It turns out that Q + Q in\nthe A-model reduces to the differential operator d = \u2202+\u2202\non M , i.e. the states of the theory lie in the de Rham cohomology. A \"physical state\" constraint requires states\nto be in H (1,1) (M ) only, which corresponds to deformations of the K\u00e4hler structure on M . One can also show\nthat correlators are independent of the complex structure modulus of M , since the corresponding operators are\nQ-exact (they decouple from the computation of string\namplitudes).\nIn the B-model the relevant cohomology is that of \u2202\nwith values in \u039b\u2217 (T M ), i.e. the observables are (0,1)forms with values in the tangent bundle T M . These correspond to complex structure deformations. One can also\nshow that in this case correlation functions are independent of K\u00e4hler moduli. So each of the two topological\nmodels depends only on half the moduli,\nA model on M :\nB model on M :\n\ndepends on K\u00e4hler moduli of M ;\ndepends on complex structure\nmoduli of M .\n\nIn this sense both models describe topological theories,\nbecause they only depend on the topology of the target,\nnot its metric.\nIt can also be shown that the relevant path\nR\nintegral e\u2212S simplifies tremendously compared to ordinary field theories. It localises on Q-invariant configurations. These are simply constant maps \u03c6 : \u03a3 \u2192 M with\nd\u03c6 = 0 for the B-model and holomorphic maps \u2202\u03c6 = 0 for\nthe A-model. In this sense the B-model is simpler than\nthe A-model, because the string worldsheet \"reduces to\n\n\f9\na point\" on M ; its correlation functions are those of a\nfield theory on M . They compute quantities determined\nby the periods of the holomorphic 3-form \u03a9(3,0) , which\nare sensitive to complex structure deformations.\nThe holomorphic maps in the A-model are called\n\"worldsheet instantons\". Each worldsheet instanton is\nweighted by\n\u0012Z\n\u0013\nexp\n(J + iB) ,\nC\n\n2\n\nwhere t = J +iB \u2208 H (M, C) is the complexified K\u00e4hler\nparameter and C is the image of the string worldsheet in\nM . Summing over all instantons makes this theory more\ncomplicated than the B-model, but only in the sense that\nit is not local on M and does not straightforwardly reduce\nto a field theory on M . In summary, the A-model moduli\nare complexified volumes of 2-cycles, while the B-model\nmoduli are the periods of \u03a9.\nLet us now talk about the relation of these topologically twisted sigma models to string theory. As mentioned before, string theory sums not only over all possible maps \u03c6 : \u03a3 \u2192 M , as discused for the sigma models\nabove, but also over all possible metrics on \u03a3. The latter\nactually reduces to a sum over the moduli space of genus\ng Riemann surfaces. The topological string free energy\nis then defined as a sum over all genera\nF =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\ngs2\u22122g Fg ,\n\n(2.27)\n\ng=0\n\nwith the string coupling gs and Fg being the amplitude\nfor a fixed genus g. The string partition function is given\nby Z = exp F .\nThe interesting quantities for the topological string\ntheory are therefore the genus g partition functions. Already at genus zero one finds a lot of interesting information about M . In the A-model the genus zero free energy\nturns out to be\nZ\nF0 =\nJ \u2227 J \u2227 J + instanton corrections . (2.28)\nM\n\nThe first term corresponds to the classical contribution\nof the worldsheet theory: it gives the leading order contribution in which the string worldsheet just reduces to\na point. The instanton term contains a sum over all homology classes H2 (M, Z) of the image of the worldsheet,\neach weighted by the complexified area, and a sum over\n\"multi-wrappings\" in which the map \u03a3 \u2192 M is not oneto-one.\nTo define the genus zero free energy in the B-model\nrequires a little more effort. We already noted that the\nrelevant moduli are periods of \u03a9 \u2208 H 3 (M, C). This cohomology can be decomposed as\nH 3 = H 3,0 \u2295 H 2,1 \u2295 H 1,2 \u2295 H 0,3 .\n\n(2.29)\n\nFor a Calabi\u2013Yau threefold the Hodge numbers are given\nby h3,0 = h0,3 = 1, because there is one unique holomorphic 3-form, and h2,1 = h1,2 . Therefore, H 3 (M, C) has\n\nreal dimension 2 h1,2 + 2. It is customary to choose a\nsymplectic basis of 3-cycles Ai and Bj with intersection\nnumbers\nAi \u2229 Aj = 0 ,\n\nBi \u2229 Bj = 0 ,\n\nAi \u2229 Bj = \u03b4ji ,\n\n(2.30)\n\nwith i, j = 1, ..., h1,2 + 1. One can then define homogeneous co-ordinates on the moduli space of complex structure deformations by\nZ\n\u03a9.\n(2.31)\nX i :=\nAi\n\nThis gives h1,2 + 1 complex co-ordinates, although the\nmoduli space only has dimension h1,2 . This overcounting\nis due to the fact that \u03a9 is only unique up to overall\nrescaling, so the same is true for the co-ordinates defined\nthis way. Therefore they carry the name \"homogeneous\nco-ordinates\". There are also h1,2 + 1 periods over Bcycles\nZ\n\u03a9.\n(2.32)\nF\u0302i :=\nBi\n\nDue to the relation between A and B cycles, there must\nbe a relation between the periods. In other words, we\ncan express F\u0302i as a function of X j .\nF\u0302i = F\u0302i (X j ) .\n\n(2.33)\n\nOne can prove that these satisfy an integrability condition,\n\u2202\n\u2202\nF\u0302j =\nF\u0302i ,\n\u2202X i\n\u2202X j\n\n(2.34)\n\nwhich allows us to define a new function F via\nF\u0302i =\n\n\u2202\nF.\n\u2202X i\n\n(2.35)\n\nThis function is actually nothing but the genus zero free\nenergy of the B-model. It is given by the simple formula\nF =\n\n1\nXi F\u0302 i .\n2\n\n(2.36)\n\nIn general, the sum over all worldsheet configurations\nis too hard to carry out explicitly. There are nevertheless\nsome tools that enable one to calculate topological string\namplitudes. For example, mirror symmetry between the\nA- and B-models can be used to compute amplitudes in\nthe model of choice (usually the B-model since it does not\nobtain instanton corrections) and then extrapolating the\nresult to the mirror theory. We will be more interested in\na duality between open and closed strings, which enables\none in principle to calculate the free energy at all genera\nfor a particular class of non-compact geometries - e.g.\nconifolds. To describe open topological strings we need to\nexplain what we mean by topological branes that appear\nas boundaries of \u03a3.\n\n\f10\nA D-brane corresponds to a boundary condition for\n\u03a3 that is BRST-invariant. In the A-model this implies\nthat the boundary should be mapped to a Lagrangian\nsubmanifold7 L of M . If we allow open strings to end on\nL, we say that the D-branes are wrapped on L. Having\na stack of N D-branes on L corresponds to including a\nweighting factor N for each boundary.\nD-branes carry gauge theories in physical string theory\n(we will use \"physical\" for the target space perspective to\ndistinguish it from toplogical string theory). The same\nis true for topological branes. In the A-model it turns\nout that one can actually compute the exact string field\ntheory, which is again a topological theory: U (N ) Chern\u2013\nSimons theory (Witten, 1986, 1995). Its action in terms\nof the U (N ) gauge connection A is given by\nS =\n\nZ\n\nL\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\nT r A \u2227 dA + A \u2227 A \u2227 A .\n3\n\n(2.37)\n\nThis action might still obtain instanton corrections, but\nWitten (1995) showed that in the special case where L =\nS 3 there are none. This is fascinating, because the S 3\nin the deformed conifold (which is also T \u2217 S 3 ) is such a\nLangrangian submanifold.\nIn physical superstring theory, D-branes are sources\nfor RR fluxes. So under what quantity are topological\nbranes charged? The only fluxes available are the K\u00e4hler\n2-form J and the holomorphic 3-form \u03a9. Wrapping a\ntopological brane on a Lagrangian subspace L of M (in\nthe A-model) creates a flux through a 2-cycle C which\n\"links\" L. This link means that C = \u2202S for some 3-cycle\nS that intersects L once, so C is homologically trivial in\nM , although it becomes nontrivial\nif considered as a cycle\nR\nin M \\ L. This implies that C J = 0 since J is closed\nand C trivial.\nWrapping N branes on L has the effect of creating a\nK\u00e4hler flux through C\nZ\n\nJ = N gs ,\n\n(2.38)\n\nC\n\nbecause the branes act as a \u03b4-function source for the twoform, i.e. J is no longer closed on L, but dJ = N gs \u03b4(L).\nSimilarly, a B-model brane on a holomorphic 2-cycle Y\ninduces a flux of \u03a9 through the 3-cycle linking Y . In\nprinciple we could also wrap branes on 0, 4 or 6-cycles in\nthe B-model, but there is no field candidate those branes\ncould be charged under. This suggests a privileged role\nfor 2-cycles.\n\n7\n\nThis means L has half the dimension of M and the K\u00e4hler\nform restricted to L vanishes or in other words it is an isotropic\nsubmanifold of maximal dimension (half of that of the ambient Calabi\u2013Yau). However, a more generic condition that allows for a non\u2013flat gauge field on the brane has been derived in\n(Kapustin and Li, 2003).\n\n2. The Gopakumar\u2013Vafa Conjecture\n\nAfter all these preliminaries we are now ready to explain the geometric transition on conifolds. This is a duality between open and closed topological strings (it has\nbeen shown that they give rise to the same string partition function) which has profound physical consequences.\nThe dual gauge theory from the open string sector is\nN = 1 SYM in d=4. The IR dynamics of this gauge\ntheory can be obtained either from the open or from the\nclosed string sector. In this sense, both string theory\nbackgrounds are dual; they compute the same superpotential because they have the same topological string partition function. The key to this duality in the gauge theory is to identify parameters from the open string theory\nwith parameters from the closed string theory. In the\nIR it will be the gluino condensate which is identified\neither with the K\u00e4hler or complex structure modulus of\nthe closed or open string theory background.\nThe\ngeometric\ntransition\nin\nquestion\n(Gopakumar and Vafa, 1999) considers the A-model\non the deformed conifold T \u2217 S 3 . As noted by Witten\n(1995), the exact partition function of this theory is\nsimply given by U (N ) Chern\u2013Simons theory. The closed\nA-model on this geometry is trivial, because it has no\nK\u00e4hler moduli. But the T \u2217 S 3 contains a Lagrangian\n3-cycle L = S 3 on which we can wrap branes in the\nopen A-model. This creates a flux N gs of J through\nthe 2-cycle C which links L, in this case C = S 2 . So it\nis natural to conjecture that this background is dual to\na background with only flux through this 2-cycle. The\nresolved conifold is the logical candidate for this dual\nbackground as it looks asymptotically like the deformed\nconifold, but has a finite S 2 at the tip of the cone. This\nled Gopakumar and Vafa to the following\nConjecture: The open A model on the deformed conifold\nT \u2217 S 3 with N branes wrapping the S 3 is dual to the closed\nA model on the resolved conifold O(\u22121)\u2295O(\u22121) \u2192 CP1 ,\nwhere the size of the CP1 is determined by t = N gs .\nThere are no branes anymore in the dual geometry;\nthere is simply no 3-cycle which they could wrap. The\npassage from one geometry to the other is called a \"geometric transition\" or \"conifold transition\" in this case.\nThe agreement of the partition function on both sides\nwas shown by Gopakumar and Vafa (1999) for arbitrary\n't Hooft coupling \u03bb = N gs and to all orders in 1/N . In\nthis sense, this duality is an example of a large N duality as suggested by 't Hooft: for large N holes in the\nRiemann surface of Feynman diagrams are \"filled in\" or\n\"condensed\", where one takes N \u2192 \u221e with gs fixed.\nThe authors Gopakumar and Vafa (1999) matched the\nfree energy Fg at every genus g via the identification of\nthe 't Hooft coupling\ni\u03bb = N gs\n\n(open)\n\n\u2194\n\ni\u03bb = t\n\n(closed) ,\n\n(2.39)\n\n\f11\nwhere t is the complexified K\u00e4hler parameter of the S 2 in\nthe resolved conifold and the identification of the 't Hooft\ncoupling for open strings is dictated by the Chern\u2013Simons\ntheory on S 3 .\nBeyond that, it was also shown that the coupling to\ngravity (to the metric8 ) and the Wilson loops take the\nsame form for the open and closed theories. The two\ntopological string theories described here correspond to\nthe different limits \u03bb \u2192 0 and \u03bb \u2192 \u221e, but they are\nconjectured to describe the same string theory (with the\nsame small gs ) only on different geometries.\n\nC. The Vafa Model\n1. Embedding Gopakumar\u2013Vafa in Superstrings and\nSuperpotential\n\nThis scenario has an embedding in \"physical\" type IIA\nstring theory. Starting with N D6-branes on the S 3 of the\ndeformed conifold we find a dual background with flux\nthrough the S 2 of the resolved conifold. The Calabi\u2013Yau\nbreaks 3/4 of the supersymmetry (which leaves 8 supercharges), therefore the theory on the worldvolume of the\nbranes has N = 1 supersymmetry (the branes break another half). There is a U (N ) gauge theory on the branes\n(in the low-energy limit of the string theory the U (1)\nfactor decouples and we have effectively SU (N )). As described in the last section, these wrapped branes create\nflux and therefore a superpotential.9 This superpotential\nis computed from topological strings, but we need a gauge\ntheory parameter in which to express it. The relevant superfield for N = 1 SU (N ) is S, the chiral superfield with\na gaugino bilinear in its bottom component. We want\nto express the free energy Fg in terms of S. Since there\nwill be contributions from worldsheets with boundaries,\nwe can arrange this into a sum over holes h:\nFg (S) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nFg,h S h .\n\n(2.40)\n\nh=0\n\nIt turns out that the genus zero term computes the pure\ngauge theory, i.e. pure SYM. Higher genera are related\nto gravitational corrections.\nAs discussed above, the open topological string theory\nis given by Chern-Simons on T \u2217 S 3 , which has no K\u00e4hler\nmodulus. The superpotential created by the open topo-\n\n8\n\n9\n\nIt might seem contradictory that there can be a coupling to the\nmetric when we are speaking about topological models. The\nclassical Chern\u2013Simons action is indeed independent of the background, but at the quantum level such a coupling can arise. On\nthe closed side there are possible IR divergences, anomalies for\nnon-compact manifolds, that depend on the boundary metric of\nthese manifolds.\nWe will set the string coupling gs = 1 throughout most of this\nsection.\n\nlogical amplitude of genus zero was found by Vafa (2001)\nto be\nZ\n\u2202F0open (S)\n+ \u03b1 S + \u03b2,\n(2.41)\nW open =\nd2 \u03b8\n\u2202S\nwith \u03b1, \u03b2 = constant and \u03b1 S being the explicit annulus\ncontribution (h = 2).\nAlthough the topological model is not sensitive to any\nflux through a 4- or 6- cycle, in the superstring theory the\ncorresponding RR forms F4 and F6 can be turned on. On\nthe closed string side this corresponds to a superpotential\nZ\nclosed\nW\n=\nF2 \u2227 (J + \u0131B) \u2227 (J + \u0131B)\nZ\nZ\n+i F4 \u2227 (J + \u0131B) + F6 , (2.42)\nwhere (J + \u0131B) is the complexified K\u00e4hler class, whose\nperiod over the basis 2-cycle gives the complex K\u00e4hler\nmodulus t (of the resolved conifold). According to Vafa\n(2001) the topological string amplitude is not modified\nby these fluxes. The genus zero topological string am0\nplitude F0 determines the size of the 4-cycle to be \u2202F\n\u2202t\n(Vafa, 2001). If we have M, L and P units of 2-, 4- and\n6-form flux, respectively, the superpotential yields after\nintegration\nW closed = M\n\n\u2202F0\n+ itL + P .\n\u2202t\n\n(2.43)\n\nNote that requiring W = 0 and \u2202t W = 0 fixes P and L\nin terms of M and t. M is of course fixed by the number\nof branes in the open string theory.\nThis looks very similar to the superpotential for the\nopen theory (2.41). We have already discussed that the\ntopological string amplitudes agree\nF open = F closed\n\n(2.44)\n\nif one identifies the relevant parameters as in (2.39). To\nmap the superpotentials onto each other we have to identify S with t and \u03b1, \u03b2 with the flux quantum numbers\niL, P . It is clear from the gauge theory side that \u03b1 (or\nL) is related to a shift in the bare coupling of the gauge\ntheory. In particular, to agree with the bare coupling to\nall orders we require iL = V /gs , where V is the volume\nof the S 3 that the branes are wrapped on. This gives an\ninteresting relation between the size V of the blown-up\nS 3 (open) and the size t of the blown-up S 2 (closed):\net \u2212 1\n\n\u0001N\n\n= const * e\u2212V .\n\n(2.45)\n\nThis indicates that for small N (N/V \u226a 1) the description with D-branes wrapped on S 3 is good (since t \u2192 0),\nwhereas for large N the description with blown-up S 2 is\ngood (since V \u2192 \u2212\u221e does not make sense). It should\nbe clear from our discussion that after the S 3 has shrunk\nto zero size there cannot be any D6-branes in the background, but RR fluxes are turned on.\n\n\f12\nLet us finish this section with the explicit derivation of\nthe Veneziano\u2013Yankielowicz superpotential in type IIB\n(Cachazo et al., 2001), from the perspective of the closed\nstring theory. This theory is mirror dual to the IIA scenario discussed above,10 so the open string theory lives\non a resolved conifold background and the closed theory\nwith fluxes lives on the deformed conifold described by\nf =\n\n4\nX\ni=1\n\nzi2 \u2212 \u03bc2 = 0.\n\n(2.46)\n\nB\n\nThe holomorphic 3-form is given by\ndz1 \u2227 dz2 \u2227 dz3\ndz1 \u2227 dz2 \u2227 dz3 \u2227 dz4\n=\ndf\n2z4\ndz1 \u2227 dz2 \u2227 dz3\n= p\n.\n(2.48)\n2 \u03bc2 \u2212 z12 \u2212 z22 \u2212 z32\n\n\u03a9 =\n\nViewing the 3-cycles A and B as 2-spheres (spanned by a\nreal subspace of z2 , z3 ) fibred over z1 , one can integrate\n\u03a9 over S 2 , resulting in a one-form\nZ\nq\n1\nz12 \u2212 \u03bc2 dz1 .\n(2.49)\n\u03a9 =\n2\u03c0i\nS2\n\nThe compact A-cycle, projected to the z1 plane, becomes\nan interval (\u2212\u03bc, \u03bc), so that the A-period results in\nZ \u221a\u03bc\nq\n1\n\u03bc\nS =\ndz\nz12 \u2212 \u03bc2 = .\n(2.50)\n1\n2\u03c0\u0131 \u2212\u221a\u03bc\n4\n\nThe non-compact B-cycle is projected to (\u03bc, \u221e).

The vacuum\nof the theory exhibits all the known phenomena of gaugino condensation, chiral symmetry breaking and domain\nwalls. This is a remarkable result and the first example\nwhere string theory produces the correct superpotential\nof a gauge theory.\nThe discussion of the IR limit deserves a word of caution. We argued earlier, that both the KS and the Vafa\nmodel reach an SU (M ) gauge theory. This suggests that\nthe open string background in Vafa's scenario is actually\nnothing but the IR limit of the KS cascade, which then\nin the far IR is dual to the closed string background.\nThis is not quite accurate, as the UV limit of Vafa's scenario does not coincide with the UV limit of KS. Instead, it approaches a (5+1)-dimensional theory. The\nUV limit of Vafa's scenario should rather correspond to\na Maldacena and Nunez (2001) (MN) type of solution.\nHowever, the MN UV\u2013limit does not quite fit into interpolating scenarios known as the KS baryonic branch\n(Gubser et al., 2004; Papadopoulos and Tseytlin, 2001),\nwhich is a one\u2013parameter family of backgrounds obtained\nby deformations of the original KS solution (Benna et al.,\n2006; Butti et al., 2005; Dymarsky et al., 2006). These\nSU (3) structure backgrounds are all expected to have a\ndual field theory description with vevs of baryonic operators turned on. The MN background, however, does not\nshare this property (Gubser et al., 2004). In terms of the\ninterpolating solution of Butti et al. (2005), it can only\nbe reached in an infinite limit of the parameter space and\ncan therefore not be interpreted as on the same \"branch\"\nas the KS solution. 11 Although we have illustrated\n\n11\n\nWe thank I. Klebanov for discussion on this point.\n\n\f13\n\nFIG. 5 Vafa's duality chain. By following the arrows through a series of mirror symmetries and a flop\ntransition we can verify the geometric transition as conjectured for IIA and IIB.\n\nvarious similarities between the KS cascade and Vafa's\ngeometric transition, the reader should keep this subtle\ndistinction in the UV behaviour in mind.\n\nmensions, the resolved geometry).12 In other words, both\nscenarios are related by an exchange of the finite-size Se3\nwith the vanishing S 3 , which is called a \"flop transition\".\nA cone over S 3 \u00d7 Se3 is given by R+ \u00d7 S 3 \u00d7 Se3 which\nis equivalent to R4 \u00d7 Se3 . The topology of this manifold\ncan be viewed as (Atiyah et al., 2001)\n\n(u21 + u22 + u23 + u24 ) \u2212 (v12 + v22 + v32 + v42 ) = V , (2.56)\n\n2. Vafa's duality chain\n\nLet us summarise the superstring picture of the conifold transition: In type IIA we start with N D6-branes on\nthe S 3 of the deformed geometry and find as its dual N\nunits of 2-form flux through the S 2 of the resolved conifold. In the mirror type IIB, N D5-branes wrapping the\nS 2 of the resolved conifold are dual (in the large N limit)\nto a background without D-branes but with the 3-form\nflux turned on. The geometry after transition is given by\nthe deformed conifold with blown-up S 3 . In both cases\nwe have to identify the complex structure modulus of\nthe deformed conifold with the K\u00e4hler modulus of the\nresolved conifold or, roughly speaking, the size of the S 3\nwith the size of the S 2 .\nThe type IIA scenario can be lifted to M -theory where\nthe deformed and resolved conifolds are related by a\nflop transition. In seven dimensions both manifolds\nstem from a manifold with G2 -holonomy and symmetry\nSU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1). Topologically, the manifold in\nquestion is equivalent to a cone over S 3 \u00d7 Se3 that has a\nU (1) fibre on which one can reduce to d=6. One can either reduce on a fibre that belongs to an S 3 of vanishing\nsize (this yields a six-dimensional manifold with blownup Se3 , the deformed conifold) or on a fibre that belongs\nto an Se3 of finite size (this gives a finite size Se2 in six di-\n\nwith ui , vi \u2208 R. For V > 0 the blown-up Se3 is described\nby ui , and the vi correspond to R4 . For V < 0 their roles\nare exchanged. The flop transition can then be viewed\nas a sign flip in V or as an exchange of the two S 3 . In\nthe presence of G-flux in M-theory the volume V can be\ncomplexified to V + iG, so that even for the transition\npoint V = 0 the singularity is avoided.\nUsing the arguments from this section, one can follow\na \"duality chain\", as depicted in Figure 5, which leads\nfrom D-branes in IIB through mirror symmetry to IIA,\nthen via an M-theory flop to the closed string side in\nIIA and back to IIB via another mirror symmetry. Precisely this chain was followed by (Becker et al., 2004),\n(Alexander et al., 2005), (Becker et al., 2006), (Knauf,\n2007) and will be reviewed in Section III.\nD. Brane constructions\n\nWe saw in Section II.A.1 that finding gauge theories\non singular geometries like the conifold can be difficult.\nA more intuitive way to arrive at these gauge theories\n\n12\n\nFurthermore modding out by a ZN in both cases gives a singularity corresponding to N D6-branes or a non-singular solution\nwith N units of flux, respectively (Atiyah et al., 2001).\n\n\f14\nis to T-dualise the type IIB picture of branes on a conifold along a direction perpendicular to the branes. As we\nshall see, this gives type IIA configurations of branes suspended between orthogonal NS5-branes, from which the\ngauge theory living on the branes can be easily deduced\nas in the Hanany-Witten set-up (Hanany and Witten,\n1997). In addition, lifting these IIA configurations to Mtheory allows one to reproduce the dualities conjectured\nvia gauge or topological string theory arguments in the\nKS and Vafa set-ups, respectively. This was done by\nDasgupta et al. (2001) for the geometric transition (see\nalso Dasgupta et al. (2002a); Hori et al. (1998)), and in\nDasgupta et al. (2002b) for Klebanov-Strassler (following\nDasgupta and Mukhi (1999a) and Dasgupta and Mukhi\n(1999b)). In both cases use was made of Witten's MQCD\n(an M-brane description of QCD) methods (Witten,\n1997a,b) based on lifting to M-theory configurations of\nD4-branes suspended between NS5-branes.\nIn this section we discuss first the brane configuration\ndual to string theory on conifold geometries and then in\nturn the relevant brane configurations dual to both the\nKlebanov-Strassler and the geometric transition (as embedded in type IIB) set-ups. In the brane configuration\npicture, and even more so in the pictures lifted to Mtheory which allow us to track the duality in each case,\nwe see the similarities between the two arguments. The\nbrane configuration picture is useful for understanding\nseveral aspects of the theories in a different way, and for\nhighlighting deep similarities between the two scenarios.\nHowever it has some limitations which should be kept in\nmind and which we shall mention as they arise.\n\n1. The T-dual of a conifold\n\nAs shown in Bershadsky et al. (1996) and\nHanany and Uranga (1998), a conifold can be described by two degenerating tori varying over a P1 base.\nWhen two T-dualities are performed, one over a cycle of\neach torus, the conifold gives rise to a pair of orthogonal\nNS5-branes. A configuration of orthogonal NS5-branes\nis also found upon performing a single T-duality along\nthe U (1) fibration of the conifold, as shown explicitly in\nDasgupta and Mukhi (1999a). To see this, consider the\nconifold equation in the form given in (A.24):\nxy \u2212 uv = 0.\n\n(2.57)\n\nWe can define co-ordinates in such a way that x = x4 +\u0131x5\nand y = x8 + \u0131x9 . Here we map \u03b81 , \u03c61 to x4 , x5 and \u03b82 , \u03c62\nto x8 , x9 . Following the literature, we will also make the\nidentifications x6 = \u03c8 and x7 = r for the rest of this\nsection. We will perform the T-duality along x6 . Our\nreason for adopting this change of coordinates is that in\nthe dual brane picture x4 , x5 , x8 and x9 are no longer\ncompact directions.\nUpon T-dualising, the NS5-branes will arise on the degeneration loci of the fibration (Bershadsky et al., 1996;\n\nUranga, 1999). The fibre degenerates at the conifold singularity, where x = y = u = v = 0. A convenient choice\nof co-ordinates allows us to take the fibre as degenerating\nto two intersecting complex lines given by\nxy = 0.\n\n(2.58)\n\nIn the T-dual picture this curve then defines the intersection of the two NS5-branes: one extends along x\n(y = u = v = 0) and the other along y (x = u = v = 0).\nFor the deformed conifold,\nxy \u2212 uv = \u03bc2 ,\n\n(2.59)\n\nxy can no longer be zero at the tip but is given by\nxy = \u03bc2 .\n\n(2.60)\n\nThis gives the intersection curve of the NS5-branes in\nthe corresponding T-dual picture. In both cases x6 and\nx7 parametrise possible separations between the NS5branes. If it is present an NS-NS B-field on a vanishing\n2-cycle in the conifold picture maps to separation in x6\nof the NS5-branes (Karch et al., 1998), while a finite S 2\nimplies a separation in x7 given by the resolution parameter.\nIn Dasgupta and Mukhi (1999a,b) and Uranga (1999)\nthis T-duality was exploited for the construction of a\ntype IIA brane configuration dual to the KlebanovWitten and Klebanov-Strassler set-ups, further studied in Dasgupta et al. (2002a,b) where Witten's MQCD\nmethods were used to track the conjectured geometric transition via the M-theory description. This was\nalso applied to Vafa's geometric transition (see also\nDasgupta et al. (2001)). A discussion of the general approach is given in Karch et al. (1998), where the references for several key results are collected.\n2. The Klebanov-Strassler set-up via brane configurations\n\nWe begin with the Klebanov-Witten set-up and then\nproceed to the Klebanov-Strassler scenario and discuss\nwhat becomes of the M fractional D3-branes under the\nT-duality.\nIn Section II.A.1 we argued that while an N = 1 supersymmetric theory with U (1) gauge group reproduced\nthe parametrisation of the conifold given by the fields\nAi , Bj and the equations (2.8) and (2.9), the gauge theory\nwhose moduli space corresponded to a single D3-brane\non the conifold had gauge group U (1) \u00d7 U (1) (which\ngeneralised to U (N ) \u00d7 U (N ) for N D3-branes). The\nappearance of two gauge group factors can be understood by T-dualising the conifold set-up in a direction\nperpendicular to the branes. Under a T-duality along\n\u03c8 or x6 a conifold will give rise to a pair of NS5-branes\n(Dasgupta and Mukhi, 1999a).13 The presence of D3-\n\n13\n\nThe explicit calculation at the supergravity level presented in\nDasgupta and Mukhi (1999a) takes the T-dual of the NS5-brane\n\n\f15\n(N, N )\n\nN D4\u2212branes\n\n_\n(N, N )\n\u2212\n0\nN D4\u2212branes\n\nNS 5\nx\n\nNS 5'\ny\n\nFIG. 6 The IIA brane configuration dual to the KlebanovWitten set-up.\n\nbranes as in the Klebanov-Witten set-up yields a configuration of D4-branes stretching between these NS5-branes,\nalong the T-dual direction x6 , as shown in Figure 6.\nWe label one NS-brane NS5 and the other NS5'. In\nthe figure, the 0123 and radial directions are suppressed.\nThe branes are orthogonal: NS5 extends in x and NS5'\nextends in y. The NS5-branes are much heavier than\nthe D4-branes because they are infinite in all of their\nworldvolume directions and so they can be treated classically (Hanany and Witten, 1997; Witten, 1997b). We\nstudy the gauge theory on the D4-branes where the NS5branes are considered as fixed and the positions of the\nD4-branes parametrise the moduli space of the theory.\nThe D4-branes have only four infinite directions, so the\nfield theory living on them is effectively 3+1-dimensional.\nIt is the same as that living on the D3-branes at the tip\nof the conifold in the IIB picture.\nAs should be clear from Fig. 6, the gauge theory is easily deduced. The configuration preserves 4 supercharges,\nand therefore describes an N = 1 supersymmetric gauge\ntheory on the D4-branes. Gauge fields transforming as\n(N, N ) or (N\u0304 , N\u0304 ) in the adjoint representation correspond to open strings ending on the D4-branes between\nthe NS5-branes, while matter fields transforming in the\nbifundamental representations (N, N\u0304 ) or (N\u0304 , N ) correspond to strings stretching between D4-branes on opposite sides of an NS5-brane. The separation of the NS5branes in x6 -direction is given by the NS-NS two-form,\nand is not specified by the geometry.14 Thus generically\nthe N D4-branes are broken into two segments by the\nNS5-branes, and the gauge group is U (N ) \u00d7 U (N ), as\nclaimed in Section II.A.1.\n\n14\n\nconfiguration described and does not exactly reproduce a conifold\nbut something similar, where x4 , x5 and x8 , x9 remain 2-planes\ninstead of the required fibred 2-spheres. This means that the\nSU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) global symmetry is not directly visible in the\nbrane construction. Other arguments, coming from the gauge\ntheory and the fact that this symmetry is regained in the Mtheory lift, nevertheless support the geometrical interpretation\ngiven here (Dasgupta and Mukhi, 1999a).\nAs expected, the separation of the NS5-branes is related to the\ncoupling(s) of the dual field theory.\n\nFor N = 1 supersymmetry the NS5-branes must be\nperpendicular. If NS5' is rotated in the (x, y)-plane so\nthat they are parallel, the gauge theory on the D4-branes\nhas N = 2 supersymmetry. In this case, the D4-branes\ncan move in x (the scalars corresponding to their fluctuations in these directions fit into the adjoint representation\nof N = 2). This is no longer true once there is a relative\nrotation of the NS5-branes, since any separation of the\nD4-branes in x would lead to twisting of the D4-branes\nthat would break supersymmetry completely. When the\nNS5-branes are perpendicular, there are no moduli for\nmotion of the D4-branes in the directions of the NS5branes. Furthermore, the angle between the NS5-branes\nserves as a SUSY-breaking parameter. In fact, this angle\n(\u03b8) is related to the mass of the adjoint chiral multiplets\nby \u03bc = tan \u03b8 (Barbon, 1997; Hori et al., 1998; Witten,\n1997b). Thus the adjoints can be integrated out of the\nsuperpotential when the NS5-branes are perpendicular,\nand agreement with Klebanov-Witten is also found at\nthe superpotential level (Dasgupta and Mukhi, 1999a).\nOn the other hand the D4-branes on either side of each\nNS5-brane cannot be split from each other, so the bifundamental fields remain massless. This T-duality therefore allows us to rederive the gauge theory dual of the\nKlebanov-Witten set-up.\nTo study the brane configuration dual to the KlebanovStrassler model we need to know how a fractional D3brane will transform under a T-duality along a direction perpendicular to it. In a five-dimensional spacetime, D3-branes and fractional D3-branes are domain\nwalls (Gubser, 1999; Gubser and Klebanov, 1998). There\nis a jump in the 5-form flux when one crosses them, and\nthis is related in AdS compactifications to the number of\nbranes on which the gauge theory lives. Thus crossing\na domain wall corresponds to increasing or decreasing\nthe rank of the gauge group in the dual gauge theory.\nIt is easy to see in the brane configuration set-up dual\nto the Klebanov-Witten scenario that addition of a single D3 brane will increase the rank of the gauge group\nfrom SU (N ) \u00d7 SU (N ) to SU (N + 1) \u00d7 SU (N + 1). However, we will soon see that the M wrapped branes of\nthe KS model map to D4-branes extended only along\npart of x6 between NS5 and NS5' (Dasgupta and Mukhi,\n1999b; Karch et al., 1998). Thus fractional D3-branes\nfunction as exotic domain walls, the crossing of which\nwill take the gauge group of the dual field theory from\nSU (N ) \u00d7 SU (N ) to SU (N + 1) \u00d7 SU (N ). With the presence of M wrapped D5-branes, the brane configuration\nshown in Figure 7 results.\nThe action of the T-duality on the M wrapped D5branes of the KS model can be deduced by noting that\nthe S 2 they wrap is the difference in the sense of homology between the two S 2 s which form the base of the\nU (1) fibration giving T 1,1 , i.e. S 2 = S12 \u2212 S22 , where the\nfirst S 2 is parametrised by \u03b81 and \u03c61 and the second is\nparametrised by \u03b82 , \u03c62 . The cohomology H 2 is given by\ntwo-forms which are closed but not exact. Candidate representatives of H 2 are sin \u03b81 d\u03b81 \u2227 d\u03c61 \u00b1 sin \u03b82 d\u03b82 \u2227 d\u03c62 ,\n\n\f16\nN\n\nN+M\n\nNS5\n\nSU(N+M) x SU(N)\n\nNS5 '\n\nFIG. 7 The IIA brane configuration dual to the KlebanovStrassler set-up.\n\nboth of which live only on the two S 2 factors in T 1,1\nand are independent of the U (1) fibre. One might\nthink that they are exact, since they can be written\nd(cos \u03b81 d\u03c61 \u00b1 cos \u03b82 d\u03c62 ), but these expressions are not\nglobally defined because \u03c6i is not well defined at the\npoles. As argued in Dasgupta and Mukhi (1999b), the\nterm with the plus sign is actually exact, since it can be\nwritten as d(d\u03c8 + cos \u03b81 d\u03c61 + cos \u03b82 d\u03c62 ) \u223c de\u03c8 , where e\u03c8\nis one of the five vielbeins and is globally defined, because\n\u03c8 exhibits a shift symmetry. Therefore it is the minus\nterm which is a representative of the second cohomology:\nsin \u03b81 d\u03b81 \u2227 d\u03c61 \u2212 sin \u03b82 d\u03b82 \u2227 d\u03c62 .\nThis means that the dual object to the domain wall in\nthe type IIA picture is something that carries a charge\naway from the (x4 , x5 ) plane and deposits it on the\n(x8 , x9 ) plane.15 A D4-brane with one end on NS5 and\nthe other on NS5' performs this function. Thus an exotic\ndomain wall maps under this T-duality into a D4-brane\nstretched only part of the way along x6 .\nNext we can use the brane picture to study the gauge\ntheory on the D4-branes. The coupling constant of\nthe gauge theory is determined by the distance between the branes in x6 (Dasgupta and Mukhi, 1999a,b;\nKarch et al., 1998), which is given by the B-field and\ntherefore matches arguments from Sections II.A.2 and\nII.C.1. For our product gauge group set-up,\n\nis because the endpoints of the D4-branes on the NS5branes introduce a dependence of a on \u03b8i , \u03c6i . Thus the\npositions of the NS5-branes should really be measured far\nfrom the D4-branes. As shown in Witten (1997b), a will\nonly have a well-defined limiting value when the NS5brane has an equal number of D4-branes on either side.\nFor the KS brane configuration, this is not the case - in\nother words the branes are bent in r (the only available\ndirection, suppressed in the figures). This introduces a\ndependence of a on r, from which one can rederive the\nrunning of the gauge theory coupling constant(s).\nIn addition, the duality cascade is also observed in\nthe brane configuration picture. An early reference is\nElitzur et al. (1997); see also Uranga (1999). The bending of the NS5-branes means that, at some point far\nfrom the suspended D4-branes, a will vanish, implying\na divergence of one coupling constant. To avoid it one\nmust move the NS5-branes, pulling one through the other\naround the circle. As NS5' approaches NS5, the N D4branes occupy the entire x6 , and the N +M branes shrink\nto zero size. When NS5' is pulled through NS5, the N\nbranes double up, while the branes that were originally\nbetween NS5 and NS5' regrow with the opposite orientation as antibranes. These can partially annihilate the\n2N branes, leaving N \u2212 M branes on the expanding segment, as shown in Figure 8. The system now has a dual\ndescription in terms of a gauge theory with gauge group\nSU (N \u2212M )\u00d7SU (N ), so that moving the branes through\neach other corresponds to performing a Seiberg duality.\n\nN\n\nN+M\n\nN\n\n1\nl6 \u2212 a\n=\n,\ng12\ngs\na\n1\n=\n,\ng22\ngs\n\n(2.61)\n(2.62)\n\nwhere g1 and g2 are the couplings of the two theories,\ngs is the string coupling, and l6 gives the circumference\nof the x6 circle so that a is the separation between the\nNS5-branes. We see that it is exactly the presence of the\nM fractional branes that breaks conformal invariance:\nIn the IIA description, a non-zero \u03b2-function arises in\nthe gauge theory when the NS5-branes are bent. This\n\n15\n\nRecall that \u03b81 , \u03c61 map to x4 , x5 , and \u03b82 , \u03c62 map to x8 , x9 . The\nU (1) fibre is \u03c8 which maps to x6 and is the direction in which\nwe perform the T-duality.\n\nN\n\n2N + N + M = N \u2212 M\n\nFIG. 8 A Seiberg duality transformation in the dual brane\npicture. Note that here N = 1 and M = 2 so in the final\npicture two of the branes are actually antibranes (denoted by\ndashed lines).\n\nThe branes continue to be bent, so one is led to repeat\nthe motion around the circle. As in the duality cascade\ndescribed in Section II.A.3, the process continues until\n\n\f17\nonly the NS5-branes with M D4-branes stretching between them are left and the gauge group is just SU (M ).\nTo see how this configuration maps to the deformed\nconifold, we have to lift it to M-theory. This allows us to\nstudy the non-perturbative dynamics of the theory. The\nfirst such analysis was performed by Witten, for the case\nof N =2 theories (Witten, 1997b), but it was generalised\nto N =1 by Brandhuber et al. (1997); Witten (1997a) and\nHori et al. (1998) and it is these results which apply most\ndirectly to our case (in particular elliptic N = 1 models).\nBoth D4-branes and NS5-branes map to M5-branes in Mtheory, with the D4-branes corresponding to M5-branes\nwrapped on the eleventh dimension x10 . Define\nx6\n\nt = e(\u2212 R +\u0131x\n\n10\n\n)\n\n,\n\n(2.63)\n\nwhere R is the radius of the eleventh dimension.16 In the\ncase that no fractional branes are present, the D4- and\nNS5-branes lift to a configuration with three separate\ncomponents. The fully wrapped N D4-branes become\nM5-branes wrapping x6 and x10 or t. These N toroidal\nbranes are described by the equations\nxN = 0,\ny N = 0,\n\n(2.64)\n\nwhich have to be supplemented with the equations describing the lifted NS5-branes: y = 0, t = 1 (NS5) and\na\nx = 0, t = e\u2212 R (NS5'). For the brane dual picture at\nthe bottom of the cascade when the D3-branes have cascaded away and the gauge group is just SU (M ), the M\nsuspended (fractional) branes join with the NS5-branes\nto become a single object in the M-theory description\n(Dasgupta and Mukhi, 1999b). This introduces dynamical effects into the model. This set-up for pure N = 1\nSYM was studied in Witten (1997a), but in the limit\nwhere x6 \u2192 \u221e.\nThe NS5-branes by themselves would lift to xy = 0,\nwhich describes the conifold. The Klebanov-Strassler\nconfiguration of NS5-branes and fractional branes lifts\nto an M5-brane described by Dasgupta et al. (2002b) as\nxy = \u03b6,\nt = xM ,\n\n(2.65)\n\nwhere \u03b6 \u2208 C is some complex parameter. If we now\ntry to continue the cascade by shrinking the distance x6\n10\nbetween the NS5-branes, we find t = e\u0131x , i.e. t now\nparametrises a circle. The embedding of the M5-brane\ninto (x, y, t) must be holomorphic in order for susy to be\npreserved but as there is no non-constant holomorphic\nmap into S 1 , t must be constant. Then (2.65) become\nxy = \u03b6,\nt = t0 .\n\n16\n\nThis object is exactly the lifted deformed conifold dual\ndescribed by (2.60). The appropriate RR flux arises from\nthe usual one-form one obtains by dimensional reduction\nof the M-theory lift to IIA on a twisted circle. It is then\nT-dualised to F3 in IIB.\n\n3. The Vafa set-up via brane configurations\n\nThe duality put forward by Vafa was studied from\nthe brane configuration point of view by Dasgupta et al.\n(2001, 2002a,b). We begin with the IIB embedding setup, in which N D5-branes wrap the finite S 2 of a resolved\nconifold. Under a T-duality in x6 , this maps to a IIA configuration of N D4-branes stretching between two orthogonal NS5-branes, similar to the brane configuration dual\nof the KS set-up.17 There are two differences between\nthe KS and Vafa brane configuration duals. Firstly, the\nNS5-branes here are also separated in x7 , with the separation in x7 given by the size of S 2 at the tip of the\nconifold, the resolution parameter. More precisely, the\ntwo NS5-branes will be separated along z = x6 + \u0131x7\nsince B2 controls the separation in x6 (Dasgupta et al.,\n2001). In the IR limit which interests us, the separation\nin x6 will be negligible. In addition, the direction along\nwhich the D4-branes stretch between NS5 and NS5' is\nnon-compact, as shown in Figure 9.\nNS5'\n\nNS5\n\nx7\n\nx\n\ny\n\nFIG. 9 The IIA brane configuration dual to the Vafa set-up.\n\nVafa's geometric transition duality as expressed in the\ntype IIB embedding can be seen directly in the IIA brane\ndescription (Dasgupta et al., 2001). The easiest way to\ntrack it is \"backwards\", beginning with the final IIB picture of a deformed conifold with fluxes and no branes\nand asking what its T-dual (along x6 ) is. Then we will\nshrink the S 3 to zero size and blow up S 2 , both in the IIA\nbrane configuration, and finally T-dualise back to IIB to\nfind the resolved conifold with wrapped D5-branes. First\nnote that the orthogonal NS5-branes described as T-dual\nto type IIB string theory on a singular conifold in Section II.D.1 are coincident in x6 and x7 . The T-dual of a\n\n(2.66)\n\nFor our case we should keep in mind that t is not periodic in x6\nso we should only use it for a finite range of values.\n\n17\n\nThis should not be confused with the mirror IIA embedding of\nVafa's, in which D6-branes wrap the S 3 of a deformed conifold.\nIn the rest of this section, any reference to T-duals or T dualities\nis to those along \u03c8 or x6 which take us between the IIB embedding set-up described above and the IIA brane configuration\ndual shown in Figure 9.\n\n\f18\ndeformed conifold consists of two NS5-branes intersecting on a curve xy = \u03bc2 . However, when there is an RR\nflux F3 through the S 3 in the IIB picture, the T-dual will\nbe modified. Since F3 has one component in the direction of the T-duality (\u03c8 or x6 ), the IIA picture will have\na 2-form flux F2 in the x, y directions.18 The geometric transition must involve shrinking the S 3 to zero size.\nThen x and y describe vanishing spheres. This implies an\ninfinite flux per unit area, which singularity is resolved\nby the creation of a D4-brane. F2 = dA couples to the\nworldvolume of the NS5-brane through\nZ\nZ\nA \u2227 \u22c6d\u03c6 =\nF2 \u2227 C4 ,\n(2.67)\nwhere \u03c6 is one of the periodic scalars on the worldvolume\nof the NS5. The correct susy-preserving source for C4 in\nthis case is a D4-brane, which intersects NS5 and NS5'\nin the requisite 4 dimensions. Since we should complete\nthe geometric transition by blowing up the two-sphere,\nit must stretch between the NS5-branes. Here we see\nthe fundamental connection between the KS and geometric transition pictures most clearly. The two directions available for the D4-brane to stretch along are x6\nand x7 . Growing it in the x6 direction only results in the\npre-transition Klebanov-Strassler IIA brane set-up, while\ngrowing it in the z = x6 + \u0131x7 direction gives exactly the\nbrane configuration dual of the resolved conifold with D5s\nwrapping the S 2 . We are able to begin with the deformed\nconifold picture in type IIB, T-dualise it to type IIA and\nfind after the relevant transitions either the T dual of the\nKS picture or of the Vafa picture, depending on whether\nthe direction in which the dual NS5-branes are separated\nis compact or not.\nThe geometric transition can also be followed in Mtheory (Dasgupta et al., 2001), where the argument now\nruns most easily in the opposite direction to that of the\nprevious paragraph. The pre-transition configuration of\nD4s stretching between orthogonal NS5-branes lifts to a\nsingle M5-brane with a complicated worldvolume structure given by R1,3 \u00d7\u03a3 where \u03a3 is a complex curve defined\nby\nxy = \u03b6,\nt = xN .\n\n(2.68)\n\nThis time we shrink S 2 to effect the transition, and find\nagain that t must parametrise a circle and is therefore\nconstant. This implies xN y N = \u03b6 N , i.e. \u03a3 \u2192 \u03a3k , where\nt = t0 and\nxy = \u03b6e\n\n2\u03c0\u0131k\nN\n\n.\n\nWe obtain N degenerate curves which are no longer\nthe M-theory lift of D4-branes, but correspond to a\n\n18\n\nThis can be seen from the fact that F3 = N \u03c93 , where \u03c93 is given\nby (2.16).\n\nclosed string background, the deformed conifold. The\nmain difference between the pre-transition set-ups in Mtheory is that the KS M5-brane is wrapped on a torus\nparametrised by x6 +\u0131x10 while the M5-brane of the Vafa\nset-up is wrapped on a cylinder x7 + \u0131x10 , at least in the\nIR.\nIII. SUPERGRAVITY TREATMENT AND NON-K\u00c4HLER\nDUALITY CHAIN\n\nIn the last section we reviewed three arguments for\ngeometric transition: one based on gauge theory, one\non topological strings and the third on brane constructions and MQCD methods. The \"duality chain\" derived by Atiyah et al. (2001); Vafa (2001), see Figure 5,\nseems to suggest a straightforward way to verify geometric transitions on the supergravity level. Exploiting the\nwell-known fact that mirror symmetry on Calabi\u2013Yaus\ncan be realized (in a certain limit) by three T-dualities,\nsee Strominger\u2013Yau\u2013Zaslow (SYZ) (Strominger et al.,\n1996), and that a T-duality for a given metric and set\nof background fields is performed by applying Buscher's\nrules (Buscher, 1987, 1988), one should be able to explicitly formulate the supergravity solution corresponding to all the links in the above chain. Proving more\nsubtle than naively expected, this analysis was nevertheless carried out (Alexander et al., 2005; Becker et al.,\n2006, 2004; Dasgupta et al., 2006; Knauf, 2007) and we\nwill review it in this section.\nThe issues that make the supergravity treatment nontrivial are the following:\n\u2022 Resolved and deformed conifolds are only approximately mirror to each other. Whereas the resolved conifold does indeed admit a T 3 fibre for\nT-dualising, the deformed conifold possesses less\nsymmetry. It is therefore only possible to recover\na deformed conifold mirror in the large complex\nstructure limit. This was discussed in great detail\nby Knauf (2007) in chapter 2.\n\u2022 Taking the back-reaction of RR and NS-NS fluxes\n(or D-branes) into account changes the IIB supergravity solution. Instead of D5-branes wrapping a\nresolved conifold, the manifold is only conformally\na Calabi\u2013Yau. It acquires a warp factor h(r), depending on the radial direction. Strictly speaking\nthis spoils the SYZ argument, but this problem can\nbe overcome by working in the \"local limit\", i.e. restricting the metric to a patch over which h(r) does\nnot vary too much. This approach is inherent to\nall references (Alexander et al., 2005; Becker et al.,\n2006, 2004; Dasgupta et al., 2006; Knauf, 2007)\nand we will comment on its shortcomings.\n\u2022 We have seen that a supergravity solution \u00e0 la\nKlebanov\u2013Strassler (with fractional branes) necessarily contains non-trivial NS-NS flux. Assuming the SYZ argument still holds and performing\n\n\f19\n\nFIG. 10 The modified duality. The backgrounds in IIA have to be replaced by non-K\u00e4hler versions of\nthe deformed and resolved conifolds and the M-theory lift does not possess G2 holonomy anymore.\n\nT-dualities along the isometry directions of the\nresolved conifold, the metric and the B-field get\nmixed. This phenomenon can be used to argue that\nthe mirror of a CY in the presence of NS-NS flux\nis no longer CY and it was postulated that these\nmanifolds are half-flat (Gurrieri et al., 2003).19 It\nhas now been established (Grana et al., 2004a,b,\n2005) that the most general N = 1 susy-preserving\nbackgrounds are generalised CYs in the sense of\nGualtieri (2003); Hitchin (2003); they contain halfflat manifolds as a subclass. Even if we don't start\nwith a simple torus, we encounter the same phenomenon of twisted fibres and the IIA solutions in\nFigure 5 have to be replaced by non-K\u00e4hler backgrounds.\n\u2022 All that said, there remains another problem: no susy-preserving background for D5branes on the resolved conifold is known (without other ingredients).\nThe one derived by\nPando Zayas and Tseytlin (2000) was later on\nshown by Cvetic et al. (2003) to break susy completely; we will review the argument in Appendix\nA.5. This problem was avoided by Becker et al.\n(2006); Knauf (2007) by constructing a IIB solution\nfrom F-theory, which in addition to the D5-branes\ncontains D7 and O7-planes. Note that this subtlety is not visible in the local limit and does not\nalter the calculations presented in Alexander et al.\n(2005); Becker et al. (2004) much. Nevertheless,\n\n19\n\nIn contrast to a CY, which is characterised by a closed fundamental 2-form J and a closed holomorphic three-form \u03a9 = \u03a9+ +i\u03a9\u2212 ,\nhalf-flat manifolds only obey d(J \u2227 J) = 0 and d\u03a9\u2212 = 0, and are\ntherefore a special class of non-K\u00e4hler manifolds (dJ 6= 0).\n\nthe whole analysis with all fluxes that are consistent with this orientifold construction was repeated\nby Knauf (2007) in full detail.\nTo treat all these subtleties simultaneously, we will first\nreview mirror symmetry \u00e0 la SYZ and explain the local\nlimit. After that we will describe the orientifold set-up\nused by Becker et al. (2006); Knauf (2007) and then walk\nthe reader through the whole duality chain, as depicted\nin Figure 10.\n\nA. Mirror symmetry between the resolved and deformed\nconifolds\n\nThe resolved and deformed conifolds describe asymptotically a cone over S 2 \u00d7 S 3 , but the singularity at\nr = 0 is smoothed out to an S 2 or S 3 , respectively. The Ricci-flat K\u00e4hler metric of the resolved\nconifold was derived by Candelas and de la Ossa (1990);\nPando Zayas and Tseytlin (2000):\nds2res = \u03b3\ne\u2032 de\nr2\n\u00012\n\u03b3\ne\u2032\n+ re2 d\u03c8e + cos \u03b8e1 d\u03c6e1 + cos \u03b8e2 d\u03c6e2\n4\n\u0001\n\u03b3\ne e2\n(3.1)\nd\u03b81 + sin2 \u03b8e1 d\u03c6e21\n+\n4\n\u0001\n\u03b3\ne + 4a2 e2\n+\nd\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8e2 d\u03c6e22 ,\n4\n\nwhere (\u03c6ei , \u03b8ei ) are the usual Euler angles on S 2 , \u03c8e =\n0 . . . 4\u03c0 is a U (1) fibre over these two spheres and \u03b3\ne is a\n\n\f20\nfunction20 of re that goes to zero as re \u2192 0. The constant a\nis called the resolution parameter, because it produces a\nfinite size prefactor for the (\u03c6e2 , \u03b8e2 )-sphere at re = 0. This\nmetric clearly has three isometries related to shift syme \u03c6e1 and \u03c6e2 . These are inmetries in the co-ordinates \u03c8,\ndeed the appropriate Killing directions as the metric was\nconstructed to be invariant under SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1)\n(Candelas and de la Ossa, 1990), see Appendix A.1, A.3\nfor a brief review.\nThe deformed conifold metric on the other\nhand is given by (Minasian and Tsimpis, 2000;\nOhta and Yokono, 2000; Papadopoulos and Tseytlin,\n2001)\nds2def\n\n= \u0393\u0302\n\n\u0014\n\n4 de\nr2\n(3.2)\nre2 (1 \u2212 \u03bc4 /e\nr4 )\n\u00112 \u0015\n\u0010\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\n+ d\u03c8 + cos \u03b81 d\u03c61 + cos \u03b82 d\u03c62\n\n\u0011i\n\u0011 \u0010\n\u03b3\u0302 h\u0010 e2 e2\nsin \u03b81 d\u03c61 + d\u03b8e12 + sin \u03b8e22 d\u03c6e22 + d\u03b8e22\n4\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u03b3\u0302\u03bc2 h\n+ 2 cos \u03c8e d\u03b8e1 d\u03b8e2 \u2212 sin \u03b8e1 sin \u03b8e2 d\u03c6e1 d\u03c6e2\n2 re\n\u0011i\n\u0010\n+ sin \u03c8e sin \u03b8e1 d\u03c6e1 d\u03b8e2 + sin \u03b8e2 d\u03c6e2 d\u03b8e1 ,\n\n+\n\nwith the deformation parameter \u03bc and a similar function\n\u03b3\u0302(e\nr ). \u0393\u0302 can be read off from equation (A.19). This mete\nric exhibits the same structure of a \u03c8-fibration\nover two\nspheres, but there are additional cross terms in the last\ntwo lines. We see that the U (1) symmetry associated\nwith shifts \u03c8e \u2192 \u03c8e + k is absent. This is not a peculiarity\nof our co-ordinate choice but an inherent property of the\ndeformed conifold. As discussed in Section II.A.2, the\ndeformed conifold breaks the U (1) symmetry of the singular conifold (which the resolved conifold also exhibits).\nClearly, the manifolds cannot be mirrors of each other\nin the naive SYZ sense: one possesses a T 3 fibration and\nthe other one doesn't. From the point of view of cohomology, mirror symmetry implies an exchange of odd\nand even cohomologies; more precisely h1,2 \u2194 h1,1 . This\nis expressed in the exchange of the blown up two-cycle\nof the resolved conifold with the blown-up three-cycle\nof the deformed conifold. But Aganagic et al. (2000);\nHori et al. (2000) made an attempt to find the mirror\nof the resolved conifold, and the resulting manifold was\nfound to differ from the deformed conifold in that some\nco-ordinates are elements of C\u2217 instead of C. The mirror\nmanifold can be described by x1 +x2 +x1 x2 et +1\u2212uv = 0,\nwhere xi \u2208 C\u2217 and u, v \u2208 C and t is the size of the blownup S 2 in the original resolved geometry. The mirror symmetry between the two manifolds only becomes exact in\nthe limit where the size of the S 2 and S 3 shrink to zero.\n\nThe way to realise mirror symmetry via T-duality even\nin the absence of isometry directions is to go to the large\ncomplex structure limit (Strominger et al., 1996) that\ntakes us away from the singular fibres. We can still apply\nSYZ if the base is large compared to the T 3 fibre. If we\ne \u03c6e1 , \u03c6e2 )\nidentify (e\nr , \u03b8e1 , \u03b8e2 ) as the base co-ordinates and (\u03c8,\n3\nas the co-ordinates of the T fibre in the resolved metric\n(3.1), we can T-dualise along the latter.\nIt was furthermore shown by Becker et al. (2004) that\nthe large complex structure limit has to be imposed \"by\nhand\", i.e. the co-ordinates (\u03b8e1 , \u03b8e2 ) receive a large boost.\nThis would be a non-trivial manipulation of the metric that is not guaranteed to preserve the Calabi\u2013Yau\nproperty, which is why the following analysis will be presented in local co-ordinates in which this boost is actually\nnothing but a co-ordinate redefinition. See Chapter 2 of\nKnauf (2007) for details; we will just review the results.\nWe restrict our analysis to a small neighbourhood of\n(r0 , hzi, h\u03c61 i, h\u03c62 i, h\u03b81 i, h\u03b82 i) by introducing\nr\nre = r0 + p \u2032 ,\n\u03b3\ne0\n\n2z\n\u03c8e = hzi + p \u2032 ,\n\u03b3\ne0 r0\n2\u03b81\n\u03b8e1 = h\u03b81 i + p ,\n\u03b3\ne0\n\n2x\n,\n\u03c6e1 = h\u03c61 i + p\n\u03b3\ne0 sinh\u03b81 i\n2y\n\u03c6e2 = h\u03c62 i + p\n,\n(e\n\u03b30 + 4a2 ) sinh\u03b82 i\n2\u03b82\n\u03b8e2 = h\u03b82 i + p\n,\n(e\n\u03b30 + 4a2 )\n\nwhere \u03b3\ne0 is constant, namely \u03b3\ne(e\nr ) evaluated at re = r0 .\nThe co-ordinates (r, z, x, y, \u03b81 , \u03b82 ) describe small deviations from these expectation values and we will call\nthem \"local co-ordinates\" henceforth. In these local coordinates the metric on the resolved conifold takes a very\nsimple form (in lowest order in local co-ordinates):\nds2 = dr2 + (dz + A dx + B dy)2\n+(dx2 + d\u03b812 ) + (dy 2 + d\u03b822 ) ,\nwhere we have defined\ns\n\u03b3\ne0\u2032\nA =\nr0 coth\u03b81 i ,\n\u03b3\ne0\ns\n\u03b3\ne0\u2032\nr0 coth\u03b82 i .\nB =\n(e\n\u03b30 + 4a2 )\n\ne as \u03b3\nThe function \u03b3\ne is related to the K\u00e4hler potential F\ne =\ne/\u2202r 2 ), and similarly for \u03b3\u0302 below, see (A.11).\nre2 (\u2202 F\n\n(3.4)\n\n(3.5)\n\nNote that at lowest order in local co-ordinates these are\nsimply constants. In Dasgupta et al. (2006) it was shown\nthat at linear order in r the \u03b8i -dependences can be resummed to give precisely cot \u03b8i instead of coth\u03b8i i, but\nfor illustrative purposes we will stick to the simplest case\nof lowest order in local co-ordinates in this article. For\nlater convenience we define\n\u03b1 = (1 + A2 + B 2 )\u22121 .\n\n20\n\n(3.3)\n\n(3.6)\n\nThe metric (3.4) is easily T-dualised along x, y and\nz (which correspond to the former isometry directions\n\n\f21\ne \u03c6e1 , \u03c6e2 ) with the help of Buscher's rules (Buscher,\n\u03c8,\n1987, 1988). To illustrate the large complex structure\nlimit, consider again (3.4), which can be written as\nds2 = dr2 + (dz + A dx + B dy)2 + |d\u03c71 |2 + |d\u03c72 |2 , (3.7)\nwith the two tori\nd\u03c71 = dx + \u03c41 d\u03b81 ,\n\nd\u03c72 = dy + \u03c42 d\u03b82 .\n\n(3.8)\n\nIn (3.4) the complex structures are simply \u03c41 = \u03c42 = i.\nNote that these tori are just local versions of the spheres\nin (3.1), since locally a sphere resembles a degenerate\ntorus.21 The large complex structure limit is then given\nby letting\n\u03c41 \u2212\u2192 i \u2212 f1 ,\n\n\u03c42 \u2212\u2192 i \u2212 f2 ,\n\n(3.9)\n\nwith real and large f1,2 . With the choice f12 = f22 = \u03b1/\u01eb\none recovers the mirror metric in type IIA (taking \u01eb \u2192 0\nand rotating the (y, \u03b82 ) torus \u2013 see Section 2.2 of Knauf\n(2007))\n2\n\nds\u03032 = dr2 + \u03b1\u22121 (dz \u2212 \u03b1A dx \u2212 \u03b1B dy)\n+ \u03b1(1 + B 2 ) (dx2 + d\u03b812 ) + \u03b1(1 + A2 ) (dy 2 + d\u03b822 )\n+ 2\u03b1AB [coshzi (d\u03b81 d\u03b82 \u2212 dx dy)\n+ sinhzi (dx d\u03b82 + dy d\u03b81 )] ,\n(3.10)\nwhich matches indeed the local limit of a deformed conifold. To see this, simply rewrite (3.2) in local co-ordinates\nsimilar to those of (3.3) (but A and B will differ). There\nis one subtle difference, though: the two spheres (tori)\nparameterised by (x, \u03b81 ) and (y, \u03b82 ) are not of the same\nsize as in the CY metric (3.2). It was discussed in Knauf\n(2007) how the mirror symmetry becomes exact in the\nlimit where the resolution and deformation parameters\napproach zero, as expected by Hori et al. (2000). But\nsince this means having vanishingly small two- or threecycles (\"close to the transition point\"), this is a regime\nwhere the base cannot be large compared to the T 3 fibre,\ni.e. we cannot expect SYZ to work. This is why the large\ncomplex structure boost \"by hand\" became necessary.\nB. IIB orientifold and resolved conifold\n\nThe SL(2, Z) symmetry of IIB string theory has been\nproposed to have a geometrical interpretation in terms\nof F-theory (Vafa, 1996). Consider an elliptically fibred\nCalabi\u2013Yau fourfold K which is a toroidal fibre bundle over a base B. Even though K is a smooth manifold, there will be points in the base where the fibre\nbecomes singular and its complex structure parameter\n\u03c4 can have non-trivial monodromy around these points.\n\n21\n\nAn F-theory compactification on K refers to a compactification of type IIB on B, where the IIB axion-dilaton\n\u03bb = \u03c7 + ie\u2212\u03c6 is identified with the geometrical parameter \u03c4 (Vafa, 1996). This leads to orientifolds in IIB (Sen,\n1996, 1997), see e.g. Dabholkar (1997) for a detailed review. In our case, the base B is an orientifold of the\nresolved conifold22\n\nThe appearance of tori instead of spheres is also consistent with\nthe dual brane pictures as described in Section II.D.\n\nB\n,\n\u03a9(\u22121)FL I2\n\n(3.11)\n\nwhere FL indicates the left-moving fermion number, \u03a9\nstands for the worldsheet parity operator and I2 is a\ntarget space parity that inverts both co-ordinates of the\ntoroidal fibre.\nIn general, \u03c4 varies over the base resulting in\na non-constant field \u03bb.\nHowever, there are possible scenarios that allow for a constant solution of \u03bb\n(Dasgupta and Mukhi, 1996; Sen, 1996, 1997). These solutions are characterised by 24 singularities in the function describing the elliptic fibration. In the special case\nwhere these singularities appear at four different locations with a multiplicity of six, \u03bb is constant. The singularities are interpreted as 24 seven-branes in F-theory and\ngive rise to 4 orientifold seven-planes with 4 D7-branes\non top of each (to cancel their charges), located at the\nfour orientifold fixed points.\nIf we now wrap D5-branes on the S 2 of the resolved\ngeometry, we obtain an intersecting D5/D7-brane scenario on a IIB orientifold. This preserves supersymmetry, because it can form a bound state (Gava et al.,\n1997). The boundstate metric was actually derived by\nDasgupta et al. (2007) and agrees with the local limit we\nuse here. We will not make explicit use of the boundstate\ndescription in order to keep this section illustrative. The\nmetric of the base B has to resemble the resolved conifold\nlocally, but globally it will also contain singularities that\ncorrespond to the 7-branes. Adding D5-branes creates\nwarp factors. To incorporate these effects we make the\nfollowing generic ansatz for the base\nds2 = h0 (e\nr ) de\nr2 + h1 (e\nr ) d\u03c8e + cos \u03b8e1 d\u03c6e1 + cos \u03b8e2 d\u03c6e2\n+h2 (e\nr ) d\u03b8e2 + h3 (e\nr ) sin2 \u03b8e1 d\u03c6e2\n1\n\n1\n\n+h4 (e\nr ) d\u03b8e22 + h5 (e\nr ) sin2 \u03b8e2 d\u03c6e22 ,\n\n\u00012\n\n(3.12)\n\nwhich allows in particular for the two spheres to be asymmetric and squashed. This ansatz is motivated by the\nidea that in the absence of D-branes and fluxes we should\nrecover the K\u00e4hler metric. Also, for re \u2192 \u221e the warp\nfactors should approach 1, so we will suppress any \u03b81,2 dependence in the functions hi although it would not\ninfluence the following local analysis. We again define\n\n22\n\nB will not be a Calabi\u2013Yau threefold anymore, since X is a\nCalabi\u2013Yau, but it is still K\u00e4hler (Becker et al., 2006).\n\n\f22\nlocal co-ordinates and absorb the prefactors hi (e\nr ), which\ngives the same simple form of the local metric\nds2 = dr2 + (dz + A dx + B dy)2\n+(dx2 + d\u03b812 ) + (dy 2 + d\u03b822 ) ,\n\n(3.13)\n\nwhere we have with a slight abuse of notation kept the\nnames A and B for the constants, but they are now more\ngenerically defined. Apart from this redefinition of A\nand B, the mirror symmetry analysis will be completely\nunchanged from Section III.A. The mirror is then given\nby (3.10), which is the local limit of a deformed conifold.\nWe will show shortly the consistency of this construction\nwith an orientifold in IIA.\nWe need our IIB background to be invariant under the\norientifold action, which is given by \u03a9 (\u22121)FL Iij . Since\nthe IIB background is invariant under \u03a9 (\u22121)FL , we require the metric to be invariant under spacetime parity\nIij of the two co-ordinates xi and xj over which the fibre\ndegenerates. Furthermore, we require the IIA orientifold\nmetric that results after three T-dualities to resemble the\ndeformed conifold. This severely restricts the possibilities for xi and xj .\nThe choice we adopt is that the F-theory torus is fibred\nnon-trivially over the two-torus (x, \u03b81 ). This is actually\nthe only choice that preserves all the symmetries we require (Becker et al., 2006). The D5-branes are wrapped\non the two-torus (or sphere) given by (y, \u03b82 ) (recall from\n(3.1) that this is the sphere that remains finite as re \u2192 0).\nThis means that under three T-dualities\nIIB on\n\nTxyz\nB\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 IIA on\n\u03a9(\u22121)FL Ix\u03b81\n\nB\u2032\n.\n\u03a9(\u22121)FL Iyz\u03b81\n\nWe find the following system of D-branes and orientifold\nplanes in type IIB\nD5 :\nD7/O7 :\n\n0 1 2 3 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 y \u03b82\n0 1 2 3 r z \u2212 \u2212 y \u03b82 ,\n\nwhich turns after three T-dualities along x, y and z into\nIIA with\nD6 :\nD6/O6 :\n\n0 1 2 3 \u2212 z x \u2212 \u2212 \u03b82\n0 1 2 3 r \u2212 x \u2212 \u2212 \u03b82 .\n\nIt is easy to see that the metric (3.13) is indeed invariant\nunder Ix\u03b81 (remember that A contains coth\u03b81 i, so it is\nodd under this parity) and the mirror will be symmetric\nunder Iyz\u03b81 after we impose some restrictions on the Bfield components (more in the next section).\nNote that the D7-branes extend along the non-compact\ndirection r. A similar brane configuration on the singular conifold was considered by Ouyang (2004), but it was\nnot constructed from F-theory23 . It was shown there how\n\nstrings stretching between D7 and D5-branes (or D6 and\nD6) give rise to a global symmetry. It is not a gauge\nsymmetry because of the large volume factor associated\nwith the D7-branes extending along the non-compact direction r. We will call the D7 or D6s that originate from\nF-theory \"flavour branes\" to distinguish them from the\nD5 or D6s that carry the gauge theory.\n\nC. Mirror symmetry with NS-NS flux and \"non-K\u00e4hler\ndeformed conifold\"\n\nHaving argued that (3.4) or equivalently (3.13) is the\ncorrect local metric for D5s and D7/O7s on the resolved\nconifold, we now turn to the first link in the duality\nchain. As already mentioned, the mirror symmetry analysis from Section III.A is changed once we take fluxes into\naccount. The full RR spectrum that is consistent with\nthe IIB orientifold was studied in Knauf (2007). We only\nfocus on the NS-NS sector here, as it alone is relevant for\nthe geometry. It should also have become clear that we\ncan only present a local analysis here, for two reasons:\n1) The mirror symmetry argument between resolved and\ndeformed conifold fails globally and 2) We don't know\nthe full F-theory solution, in other words the functions\nhi (e\nr ) in (3.12) remain unknown.\nFor the NS-NS flux we make the most generic ansatz\nthat is consistent with our orientifold, with one exception: we only allow for electric NS-NS flux (magnetic\nNS-NS flux leads in general to non-geometrical solutions (Dabholkar and Hull, 2006; Flournoy et al., 2005;\nHellerman et al., 2004; Hull, 2005; Shelton et al., 2005)),\ni.e. B-field components that have only one leg along Tduality directions:24\nB2IIB = bz\u03b81 dz\u2227d\u03b81 +bx\u03b82 dx\u2227d\u03b82 +by\u03b81 dy\u2227d\u03b81 . (3.14)\nIn general, the coefficients bz\u03b81 , bx\u03b82 and by\u03b81 can depend\non all base co-ordinates (r, \u03b81 , \u03b82 ) to preserve the background's isometries.\nThis B-field has non-trivial consequences when we perform T-dualities along x, y and z. We will not merely\nfind a local version of the deformed conifold, but a manifold with twisted fibres that is clearly the local limit of a\nnon-K\u00e4hler version of the deformed conifold.\nThe reason why mirror symmetry with NS-NS field\ngives rise to a non-K\u00e4hler manifold is actually very easy\nto illustrate in the SYZ picture. T-duality mixes B-field\n\n24\n23\n\nThis analysis has recently been extended to the resolved conifold\n(Dasgupta et al., 2008).\n\nWithout loss of generality we do not include components involving dr since components of the 3-form field strength like\ndr \u2227 dx \u2227 d\u03b8i can easily be obtained from \u2202r bxi (r) dr \u2227 dx \u2227 d\u03b8i .\n\n\f23\nand metric. In the presence of NS-NS flux, Buscher's\nrules (Buscher, 1987, 1988) read\n\ne \u03bc\u03bd\nG\ne\u03bc\u03bd\nB\n\ne\u03bcy\nB\n\n1\n,\nGyy\n\ne \u03bcy = B\u03bcy ,\nG\nGyy\nG\u03bcy G\u03bdy \u2212 B\u03bcy , B\u03bdy\n,\n(3.15)\n= G\u03bc\u03bd \u2212\nGyy\nB\u03bcy G\u03bdy \u2212 G\u03bcy B\u03bdy\n= B\u03bc\u03bd \u2212\n,\nGyy\nG\u03bcy\n,\n=\nGyy\n\ne yy =\nG\n\nso cross terms in the metric are traded against the corresponding components in B2 and vice versa. Therefore,\nthe T 3 fibres acquire a twisting by B2 -dependent oneforms under T-duality that we denote by\ndx \u2212\u2192 dx\u0302 = dx \u2212 bx\u03b82 d\u03b82 ,\ndy \u2212\u2192 d\u0177 = dy \u2212 by\u03b81 d\u03b81 ,\ndz \u2212\u2192 d\u1e91 = dz \u2212 bz\u03b81 d\u03b81 .\n\nit is at best a conformal Calabi\u2013Yau. Conformal Calabi\u2013\nYaus are complex manifolds,25 and there is ample evidence in the literature, see e.g. Chuang et al. (2007);\nJeschek (2004), that the mirror of a complex manifold\nis symplectic (which can be half-flat at the same time,\nbut does not have to be). Furthermore, our background\nincludes RR flux and therefore has to fulfill different susy\nrequirements than a purely geometrical background, i.e.\nit does not lift to a manifold with G2 -holonomy, as halfflat manifolds do, but only to one with G2 structure.\n\nD. Completing the duality chain\n\nWith the metric (3.17) we are now ready to follow the\nduality chain through the M-theory flop and back to type\nIIB.\n\n(3.16)\n\nThis does not mean that dx\u0302 etc. are exact; in general the\nB-field is non-constant. Apart from this modification, we\nperform the same steps as in Section III.A: we boost the\ncomplex structure as in (3.9) and take the limit \u01eb \u2192 0.\nThen we find the mirror in IIA to be\nde\ns2 = dr2 + \u03b1\u22121 [d\u1e91 \u2212 \u03b1A dx\u0302 \u2212 \u03b1B d\u0177]2\n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0002\n+ \u03b1(1 + B 2 ) d\u03b812 + dx\u03022 + \u03b1(1 + A2 ) d\u03b822 + d\u0177 2\n\u0002\n\u0003\n+ 2\u03b1AB coshzi d\u03b81 d\u03b82 \u2212 dx\u0302 d\u0177\n\u0003\n\u0002\n(3.17)\n+ 2\u03b1AB sinhzi dx\u0302 d\u03b82 + d\u0177 d\u03b81 ,\n\nwith \u03b1 defined in (3.6). We therefore conjecture the local\nresolved conifold to be mirror dual to a local \"non-K\u00e4hler\ndeformed conifold\" with twisted fibres that make this\nmetric inherently non-K\u00e4hler.\nIn the absence of a B-field this is clearly a K\u00e4hler background, since in this local version all coefficients in the\nmetric are constants. With a B-field dependent fibration\nthe fundamental two-form will in general no longer be\nclosed, because it will depend on derivatives of bij . A\nmore thorough analysis of this geometry was attempted\nin Knauf (2007), but it remains somewhat incomplete\nbecause we lack the knowledge of a global background.\nStrictly speaking, we only know the metric in a small\npatch and have no global information about the manifold. We can, however, make some predictions on what\nwe expect for the global solution, since supersymmetry\nimposes restrictions on allowed non-K\u00e4hler manifolds.\nWe were able to show that this metric admits a symplectic structure, but we were not able to find a half-flat\nstructure (with quite a generic ansatz for the almost complex structure, see Chapter 4 in Knauf (2007)). This is\nnot in contradiction with the results from Gurrieri et al.\n(2003), where the mirror of a torus was found to be halfflat. Our IIB starting background is not a Calabi\u2013Yau;\n\nM-theory lift\n\nNote that there is no longer any NS-NS flux in our IIA\nbackground since it was completely \"used up\" under Tduality and became part of the metric, but there is RR\nflux, dual to the RR three- and five-forms of the original\nIIB background. This flux means that we have to lift\nthe ten-dimensional solution on a twisted fibre instead\nof a circle and that there will be G-flux in M-theory. It\nwas shown in Becker et al. (2004); Knauf (2007) that the\nRR flux does not change during the flop, so let us only\nconsider the RR one-form potential that enters into the\neleven-dimensional metric. It can be written as\nC1 = \u22061 dx\u0302 \u2212 \u22062 d\u0177 ,\n\n(3.18)\n\nwhere \u22061 and \u22062 depend on the assumptions made about\nthe IIB RR forms in the very beginning. (Recall the\ndefinition of the twisted fibres dx\u0302, d\u0177, d\u1e91 from (3.16).)\nAs usual in the presence of a gauge field C1 and dilaton \u03c6 (which remains unchanged under three T-dualities\n(Becker et al., 2004; Knauf, 2007)), type IIA on a manifold X is lifted to M-theory on a twisted circle via\nds2M = e\u22122\u03c6/3 ds2X + e4\u03c6/3 (dx11 + C1 )2 ,\n\n(3.19)\n\nwith x11 parametrising the extra dimension with radius\nR: x11 \u2208 (0, 2\u03c0R). In the limit R \u2192 0 we recover 10-\n\n25\n\nThis is obvious from their SU (3) torsion classes, for example. See\ne.g. Chiossi and Salamon (2002); Lopes Cardoso et al.

They are very similar in structure, even more\nso if one introduces new co-ordinates \u03c81 and \u03c82 via\ndz = d\u03c81 \u2212 d\u03c82\n\nand\n\ndx11 = d\u03c81 + d\u03c82 . (3.21)\n\nThis choice is particularly convenient for performing the\nflop, as we will explain now.\nFlop\n\nThe metric of all three conifold geometries can be written in terms of two sets of SU (2) left-invariant one-forms,\nsee Appendix A.4.

(2002b), i.e. the limit c \u2192 0 corresponds\nto a reduction to ten dimensions. This metric has less\nsymmetry than the metric in Atiyah et al. (2001), for\nwhich the flop was discussed. Note that the parameter\n\u03be describes an asymmetry between the two S 2 in a deformed metric. It seems therefore appropriate to adopt\nthis ansatz for our purposes.\nOf course our metric (3.20) does not describe S 3 \u00d7 S 3\nprincipal orbits. Recall that our co-ordinates x, y, z are\nnon-trivially fibred due to the B-field components which\nentered into the metric. We can nevertheless adopt the\nansatz (3.24) with a different definition of vielbeins:\n\u03c31\n\u03c32\n\u03c33\n\u03a31\n\u03a32\n\u03a33\n\n(\u03c3i + \u03a3i )2\n\n(3.23)\n\ni=1\n\n2\n\n+ b2 (\u03c312 + \u03c322 ) + c2 (\u03a33 \u2212 \u03c33 ) + f 2 (\u03a33 + g3 \u03c33 )2 ,\n\ni=1\n2\n\n+C (\u03c33 \u2212 \u03a33 ) + D dr ;\n2\n2\nX\nX\ne2\ne2\n(\u03a3i )2\n(\u03c3i )2 + B\n= A\ni=1\n\nthe resolved conifold does not have this symmetry since\ne 6= B.\ne\nA\nBoth geometries can be lifted to a G2 holonomy manifold, a cone over S 3 \u00d7 Se3 , where S 3 describes a sphere\nwith vanishing size at the tip of the cone, whereas Se3\nremains finite. As described in Section II.C.2, the flop\ncorresponds to an exchange S 3 \u2194 Se3 . In terms of vielbeins, the flop simply amounts to an exchange \u03c3i \u2194 \u03a3i ,\nsince each S 3 is described by a set of SU (2) left invariant\none-forms. But note that this also implies that the U (1)\nfibre along which one reduces to d=6 is contained either\nin \u03c33 or \u03a33 , i.e. it is given either by \u03c81 or \u03c82 , but not\nby x11 = \u03c81 + \u03c82 as we defined it in (3.21).\nThis discussion was for Calabi\u2013Yau metrics. The \"nonK\u00e4hler deformed conifold\" we found in Section III.C does\nnot have two S 2 s of the same size. We therefore need to\nuse a more general ansatz. In Cvetic et al. (2002a,b) it\nwas shown that there exists a one-parameter family of\nG2 \u2013holonomy metrics (that includes the lift of the resolved and deformed conifolds27 ) of the form\n\u0002\n\u0003\nds2 = dr2 + a2 (\u03a31 + \u03be\u03c31 )2 + (\u03a32 + \u03be\u03c32 )2\n(3.24)\n\n2\n\n+C (\u03c33 \u2212 \u03a33 ) + D dr ,\n\nwith the coefficients A, B etc. determined by K\u00e4hler and\nRicci flatness conditions, see (A.30) and (A.19). This\nclearly shows that the deformed conifold is completely\nsymmetric under a Z2 that acts as \u03c3i \u2194 \u03a3i , whereas\n\nWe are essentially following the conventions of Cvetic et al.\n(2002a,b), but our notation differs from theirs by \u03c62 \u2192 \u2212\u03c62 .\n\ncos \u03c81 d\u03b81 + sin \u03c81 dx\u0302,\n\u2212 sin \u03c81 d\u03b81 + cos \u03c81 dx\u0302,\nd\u03c81 \u2212 \u03b1A dx\u0302,\ncos \u03c82 d\u03b82 \u2212 sin \u03c82 d\u0177,\n\u2212 sin \u03c82 d\u03b82 \u2212 cos \u03c82 d\u0177,\nd\u03c82 + \u03b1B d\u0177 .\n\n(3.25)\n\nThe flop has to be different from the case considered\nin Atiyah et al. (2001), since we do not want to exchange\nthe roles of \u03c81 and \u03c82 , but we want to exchange x11 and\nz as these are the naturally fibred co-ordinates in (3.20).\nFurthermore, we have the asymmetry factor \u03be, so that\n\n27\n\n26\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nIn particular, Cvetic et al. (2002b) solved the differential equations for the r\u2013dependent coefficients a, b, c, f, g3 and \u03be and\nshowed that the resulting K\u00e4hler form looks like that for the\nresolved conifold. It was not considered how a flop between resolved and deformed conifolds can be performed.\n\n\f25\nour metric does not exhibit the Z2 symmetry \u03c3i \u2194 \u03a3i\nas the lift of the Calabi\u2013Yau deformed conifold does. As\nexplained in Section 3.3 of Knauf (2007), the flop in our\nconventions corresponds to\n\u03c33 \u2212 \u03a33 \u2194 \u03c33 + \u03a33 ,\n\u03c3i \u2192 \u03a3i ,\n\u03a3i \u2192 \u03be (\u03c3i \u2212 \u03a3i ),\n\n(3.26)\n\nwith i = 1, 2.

Instead, we\nfind\n\u0002\nds2IIA = dr2 + e2\u03c6 (dz \u2212 bz\u03b81 d\u03b81 )\n\u00032\n\u2212 \u03b1A (dx \u2212 bx\u03b82 d\u03b82 ) \u2212 \u03b1B (dy \u2212 by\u03b81 d\u03b81 )\n\u0003\n\u0002\n+ C d\u03b812 + (dx \u2212 bx\u03b82 d\u03b82 )2\n\u0003\n\u0002\n(3.28)\n+ D d\u03b822 + (dy \u2212 by\u03b81 d\u03b81 )2 ,\nwhere we have written the fibration structure explicitly\nas a reminder that the original IIB B-field is contained in\nthis metric.

Comparing it to (3.13) shows that it also possesses the characteristic metric of a resolved conifold (locally). We therefore baptise this manifold a \"non-K\u00e4hler\n\n28\n\nHere we used an explicit gauge choice for the RR one-form corresponding to C1 = \u2212\u03b1A dx\u0302 + \u03b1B d\u0177.\n\nresolved conifold\" and claim it to be transition dual to\nthe metric (3.17). The latter is a manifold with D6branes wrapping a 3-cycle, whereas the former describes\na blown-up 2-cycle with fluxes on it.\nThe final mirror\n\nWe can now \"close the duality chain\" by performing\nanother mirror which takes us back to IIB. We should\nrecover a K\u00e4hler background similar to the Klebanov\u2013\nStrassler model (Klebanov and Strassler, 2000), since we\nstarted with a K\u00e4hler manifold in IIB. In principle the\nanalysis follows the same steps as laid out when Tdualising the resolved conifold from IIB to IIA without\nNS-NS flux in Section III.A, only now our starting metric\nis the non-K\u00e4hler version of the resolved conifold (3.28).\nT-dualising this background along x, y and z is tedious but nevertheless straightforward. See Section 3.4\nof Knauf (2007) for the details of the calculation. We\nmake the fascinating observation that the same mechanism that converted the B-field into metric cross terms\nnow serves to restore bx\u03b82 , by\u03b81 and bz\u03b81 as the B-field\nand the metric is completely free of any B-field dependent fibration. The final IIB metric after transition is\nfound to be\nds\u03032IIB = dr2\n\u00032\ne\u22122\u03c6 \u0002\n+\ndz + \u03b10 \u03b1ADe2\u03c6 dx + \u03b10 \u03b1BCe2\u03c6 dy\n\u03b10 CD\n\u0001\n+ \u03b10 D + \u03b12 B 2 e2\u03c6 (dx2 + \u03b6 d\u03b812 )\n(3.30)\n\u0001\n2 2 2\u03c6\n2\n2\n+ \u03b10 C + \u03b1 A e\n(dy + d\u03b82 )\n\u0002\n2\n2\u03c6\n+ 2\u03b10 \u03b1 ABe\ncoshzi(d\u03b81 d\u03b82 \u2212 dx dy)\n\u0003\n+ sinhzi(dx d\u03b82 + dy d\u03b81 ) ,\n\nwhere we have introduced the \"squashing factor\"\n\u03b6 =\n\nC \u2212 \u03b12 A2 \u03b2\u030312\n.\n\u03b10 (D + \u03b12 B 2 e2\u03c6 )\n\n(3.31)\n\nWe therefore find that the final IIB metric after the flop\n(3.30) is not quite a deformed conifold due to the asymmetry in the (x, \u03b81 ) sphere/torus. In the local version\npresented above it is of course K\u00e4hler (all coefficients are\nconstant), but we cannot make any statement about the\nglobal behaviour. Remember that we do not have the\nglobal metric for our starting background with D7/O7\nand D5-branes.\nThe cross terms in the metric (3.28) are now converted into B-field components by the same mechanism\nof Buscher's rules (3.15). One recovers the B-field (3.14)\nwe started with in IIB before the transition. The same\nholds true for the RR flux. The flux does not change\nunder geometric transition (Becker et al., 2004; Knauf,\n2007), confirming the picture advocated by Vafa (2001).\nIn conclusion, we have shown that we can construct a\nnew pair of IIA string theory backgrounds that are non-\n\n\f26\nK\u00e4hler and deviate from the deformed and resolved conifolds in a very precise manner: the T 3 fibres are twisted\nby the B-field. They are related by a geometric transition, because their respective lifts to M-theory are related by a flop. The IIB backgrounds (3.13) and (3.30),\non the other hand, are K\u00e4hler and are also transition\ndual, based on mirror symmetry.\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nWe have presented a supergravity analysis confirming Vafa's \"duality chain\", see Figure 5, with the inclusion of non-K\u00e4hler manifolds in type IIA. These manifolds are non-K\u00e4hler due to a twisting of their fibres\nby the B-field that is introduced via T-duality. Thus,\nthey should fall into the classification of T-folds (Hull,\n2005), where the transition functions of a manifold are\nallowed to take values in the T-duality group O(d, d; Z)\nor into generalised complex geometries (Gualtieri, 2003;\nHitchin, 2003). They are only trivial examples though,\nas we have only considered T-duality with a B-field\nof (1,1)-type (also called \"electric\"). Thus our backgrounds are still geometric, i.e. true manifolds rather\nthan T-folds, and their generalised complex structure is\nnot of a mixed type, but purely symplectic (as the IIB\nbackground we started with was complex and it is by\nnow well established that mirror symmetry with \"electric\" NS-NS flux connects complex and symplectic manifolds (Chuang et al., 2007; Jeschek, 2004)). A symplectic structure was indeed found in terms of SU (3) torsion\nclasses; see Becker et al. (2006); Knauf (2007) for details.\nWe still lack a global description for these manifolds,\nas mirror symmetry between the resolved and the deformed conifolds forced us to adopt a local limit. On\ntop of that, there is no known global description for our\nIIB starting background: D5-branes wrapped on the resolution of the conifold. The Pando Zayas\u2013Tseytlin solution (Pando Zayas and Tseytlin, 2000) suggested for this\ncase explicitly breaks supersymmetry, as explained in Appendix A.5. We circumvented this problem by viewing\nthe IIB background as an orientifold stemming from Ftheory. This background contains additional D7-branes\nand O7-planes, but allows for a supersymmetric background with D5-branes. We left the ansatz for the fluxes\ngeneric, as long as they are invariant under the orientifold operation. It would of course be more satisfying\nto find a global background with all these properties and\nexplicitly confirm its supersymmetry.\nOnce we introduce additional D7-branes, we might immediately ask two questions: Can the D5s and D7s form\na supersymmetric bound state? And do these branes introduce additional symmetry into the dual gauge theory?\nBoth questions have been answered affirmatively; see\nDasgupta et al. (2007) and Becker et al. (2006), respectively. In Dasgupta et al. (2007) the metric of a D5/D7\nbound state on a resolved conifold geometry was found\n\nexactly, in the sense that all backreactions neglected in\nearlier papers were taken into account. Difficulties inherent in solving the equations of motion were circumvented by a U-duality chain which took as its starting\npoint a D1/F1 bound state or (m,n) string. The result\nmatches earlier conjectures in certain limits, completing\nthe supergravity description of the Vafa duality chain\nstarting point as found from the F-theory set-up. The\n7-branes from F-theory will lead to a global symmetry\ngroup depending on the special degeneration of the Ftheory torus over the base. In Becker et al. (2006) the\nsymmetry group was argued to be SU (2)16 . This was\ndue to the fact that in IIB every orientifold fixed point\ncontributes four D7-branes giving rise to an SO(8) that\nis broken by Wilson lines to SO(4) \u00d7 SO(4) \u2243 SU (2)4 .\nThis is consistent with the IIA orientifold that contains\neight fixed points, each accompanied by two D6-branes.\nThe symmetry group generated by eight stacks of D6s is\ntherefore SO(4)8 \u2243 SU (2)16 . In Dasgupta and Mukhi\n(1996) it was shown that one can even construct the\nexceptional gauge groups E6 , E7 and E8 , which are of\nparticular interest for Grand Unified Theories (GUTs).\nThe D7s don't give rise to a gauge symmetry because\nthey extend along the non-compact radial direction and\ntherefore suffer from a large-volume suppression. A similar set-up was suggested by Ouyang (2004), but there\nthe flavour branes did not have an F-theory origin and\nwere treated in a probe approximation.\nThe superpotential in our flux backgrounds also remains to be calculated. One of the remarkable results\nfrom Vafa (2001) was to show that the flux generated superpotential does indeed agree (at lowest order) with the\nVeneziano\u2013Yankielowicz superpotential for Super\u2013Yang\u2013\nMills (SYM) theory. This superpotential actually receives corrections from field theory (Cerdeno et al., 2003;\nFarrar et al., 1998) as well as from string theory considerations (Dijkgraaf and Vafa, 2002). One question we\nwould like to address is whether a generalised superpotential (taking the non-K\u00e4hler structure of the target\nmanifold into account) might be better suited to reproduce these corrections. Furthermore, we would like to\naddress the additional global symmetry. The field theory analogue to Veneziano\u2013Yankielowicz for an SU (N )\ntheory with matter is given by the Affleck\u2013Dine\u2013Seiberg\nsuperpotential (Affleck et al., 1984). It would be interesting to see if we could reproduce this superpotential\n(as in the case of a Calabi\u2013Yau orbifold C3 /Z2 \u00d7 Z2\n(Imeroni and Lerda, 2003)) or if we would find an extension to it when including the flux due to D7-branes.\nWe would need the precise supergravity solution to see\nwhich fluxes are actually turned on. In our set-up, the\ncharge of the D7-branes is immediately cancelled by the\norientifold planes. We would have to move the orientifold\nplanes away from the flavour branes to observe their effect. This would lead to non-perturbative corrections.\nAnother generalisation of our duality chain was suggested by Alexander et al. (2005). One can exploit the\nidea of a IIB orientifold to go to the orientifold limit i.e.\n\n\f27\n\nFIG. 11 The heterotic duality chain. Following the arrows we can construct non-K\u00e4hler backgrounds\nin type I and heterotic theory that are dual to the type IIB backgrounds before and after transition.\nThis implies that the new backgrounds are also transition duals in some sense.\n\ntype I. Another S-duality takes us to heterotic SO(32)\nand we find two non-K\u00e4hler backgrounds that must in\na certain sense be dual to each other, since they are individually U-dual to the IIB backgrounds for which we\nconfirmed the geometric transition picture, see Figure 11.\nThe orientifold operator we have to choose here is different from the one used in Section III.B and the heterotic\nbackgrounds will therefore not resemble non-K\u00e4hler versions29 of conifolds anymore. See Alexander et al. (2005)\nor Knauf (2007) for details.\nThe interpretation of this duality is still mysterious.\nSince heterotic string theory does not contain any open\nstrings, the interpretation as an open/closed duality fails.\nWe think this is a case where the geometric transition\nchanges the vector bundle in a way that it requires the introduction of NS5-branes as localised sources for anomaly\ncancellation (before transition). It would also be interesting to study the underlying topological (0,2) theory.\nResults from Kapustin (2005); Katz and Sharpe (2006);\nSharpe (2005) and Witten (2005) should prove useful\nhere.\nWe would also like to gain a better understanding of\nhow our IIA non-K\u00e4hler backgrounds fit into generalised\ncomplex geometry. We have not explicitly shown that our\nmanifolds are (twisted) generalised Calabi\u2013Yau (i.e. possess a (twisted) closed pure spinor (Grana et al., 2004a,b,\n2005) or have SU (3) \u00d7 SU (3) structure, see Grana et al.\n(2007) and references therein), which is the most general\n\n29\n\nThese manifolds are non-K\u00e4hler because we perform 2 Tdualities before S-dualising to heterotic. The aim is to \"use up\"\nall the NS-NS field of the IIB theory, so that only RR flux is\nleft, which becomes NS-NS flux in the heterotic theory and to\nconvert the D5/D7 system into D5/D9s.\n\ncondition for all non-K\u00e4hler backgrounds with fluxes to\npreserve supersymmetry (there is a second pure spinor,\nwhich is not closed, but its derivative is proportional\nto the RR field strengths; NS-NS flux and dilaton enter into the (twisted) d-operator). With much progress\nhaving been made in the field of generalised topological\nsigma models (Kapustin and Li, 2004; Lindstrom et al.,\n2005) and topological string theory (Kapustin, 2004;\nKapustin and Li, 2005; Pestun, 2006) one could hope to\nrepeat the analysis of Bershadsky et al. (1994) on these\nkinds of backgrounds and show agreement of the open\nand closed generalised topological partition functions.\nThis is complicated by the fact that we also have RR\nflux in our model, whose role in topological string theory\nis still not well understood.\n\nTo make contact with phenomenology, one would need\nto compactify the six-dimensional manifolds suggested\nhere. Since our analysis was performed in a local limit\nanyway, it would still hold if the conifold bulk was cut\noff and replaced with a compact Calabi\u2013Yau. This is\nsimilar in spirit to all the cosmological models working\nwith the \"warped Klebanov\u2013Strassler throat\". Indeed,\nonce we compactify we would also be forced to introduce extra objects for charge cancellation. If these were\nanti-D-branes, we'd find ourselves in the realm of nonsupersymmetric, potentially viable cosmological models.\nAnother phenomenologically appealing direction is the\nstudy of more realistic gauge groups, like the standard\nmodel or simply QCD, in terms of geometric transitions.\nFor the future one might hope that open-closed duality\ncan teach us something about the strong coupling behaviour of confining gauge theories.\n\n\f28\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank our collaborators on the various\nprojects that entered into this review, Stephon Alexander, Katrin Becker, Melanie Becker, Keshav Dasgupta,\nMarc Grisaru, Sheldon Katz and Radu Tatar, and we are\nvery grateful to Keshav Dasgupta, Andrew Frey and Igor\nKlebanov for many helpful discussions.

There are two \"relatives\" of the conifold, in which the singularity has been\nsmoothed out in two different ways: one is called a \"resolved conifold\", with a blown-up S 2 at the tip of the\ncone; the other is the \"deformed conifold\", in which the\nsingularity is blown up into an S 3 . All three manifolds\nlook asymptotically the same, like a cone over S 2 \u00d7 S 3 .\nTheir metrics then take the form\nds2 = dr2 + r2 ds2base .\n\nCandelas and de la Ossa (1990); Minasian and Tsimpis\n(2000);\nPando Zayas and Tseytlin\n(2000)\nand\nPapadopoulos and Tseytlin (2001).\n1. The singular conifold\n\nJust as a two-dimensional cone is embedded in real\nthree-dimensional space as x2 + y 2 \u2212 z 2 = 0, a real sixdimensional conifold can be expressed in terms of three\ncomplex co-ordinates, and is therefore embedded in C4\nas\n4\nX\n\nThis describes a surface which is smooth apart from a\nsingularity at zi = 0. The space has an SO(4) \u2248 SU (2)\u00d7\nSU (2) symmetry by which the zi are rotated into each\nother, and a U (1) which rotates all the zi by the same\nphase. There is also a scaling symmetry given by the\ntransformation zi \u2192 tzi , t \u2208 C\u22c6 . By choosing zi = xi +\n\u0131yi , we can rewrite (A.2) as\n4\nX\n\n4\nX\n(x2i \u2212 yi2 ) = 0 .\n\nxi yi = 0 ,\n\n(A.3)\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nThe xi describe a three-sphere for any yi , with vanishing\nradius at yi = 0, and the co-ordinates yi are orthogonally\nfibred to them. Therefore the space is given by T \u2217 S 3 .\nTo find the base of the conifold we take its intersection\nwith a three-sphere of radius r:\n4\nX\ni=1\n\n|zi |2 =\n\n4\nX\n\n(x2i + yi2 ) = r2 ,\n\n(A.4)\n\ni=1\n\nwhich removes the scaling symmetry zi \u2192 tzi . The resulting five-dimensional space is a Sasaki\u2013Einstein manifold30 called T 1,1 . Together with \u221a\n(A.3) we see that (A.4)\ngives a three-sphere of radius r/ 2 parametrised by xi ,\nwhereas the yi describe a two-sphere fibred over the S 3 .\nSince all such fibrations are trivial, the topology of the\nbase T 1,1 is S 2 \u00d7 S 3 (Candelas and de la Ossa, 1990).\nT 1,1 also has a coset space description as (SU (2) \u00d7\nSU (2))/U (1). To see this, define\n1 X n\n\u03c3 zn ,\nW = \u221a\n2 n\n\nHere, the deformed conifold on the left approaches the\nsingular conifold as the S 3 shrinks to zero size and the\nresolved conifold is obtained by blowing up the orthogonal S 2 .\nWe will in the following review the symmetry properties and Ricci-flat K\u00e4hler metrics on all three manifolds, as well as discuss\ntheir complex structures.\nUseful references are\n\n(A.2)\n\ni=1\n\n(A.1)\n\nIt was shown in Candelas and de la Ossa (1990) that all\nthree possess a K\u00e4hler metric and are Ricci flat and that\none can pass continuously from one geometry to another.\nThis is despite the fact that they are topologically different, which is seen immediately from the Euler numbers:\n\u03c7(S 3 ) = 0, \u03c7(point) = 1 and \u03c7(S 2 ) = 2. This transition\nis called a \"conifold transition\" and can be pictured as\nfollows:\n\nzi2 = 0 .\n\n(A.5)\n\nwith \u03c3 n the Pauli matrices for n = 1, 2, 3 and \u03c3 4 = \u01311 so\nthat\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nz3 + \u0131z4 z1 \u2212 \u0131z2\nW = \u221a\n.\n2 z1 + \u0131z2 \u2212z3 + \u0131z4\n\n30\n\nThe base of a K\u00e4hler cone is a Sasakian manifold and the base\nof a Ricci-flat cone is an Einstein manifold, so the base of a\nCalabi-Yau cone is a Sasaki-Einstein manifold.\n\n\f29\nThen the defining equation for the conifold (A.2) and the\nbase (A.4) can be written as\ndet W = 0 ,\ntrW \u2020 W = r2 .\nBy a rescaling Z =\n\nW\nr\n\n(A.6)\n(A.7)\n\nthese become\ndet Z = 0,\ntrZ \u2020 Z = 1.\n\nGiven a particular solution Z0 , say Z0 = 12 (\u03c31 + \u0131\u03c32 ), the\ngeneral solution can be written as\nZ = LZ0 R\u2020 ,\n\n(A.8)\n\nwhere\nL=\n\n\u0012\n\na \u2212b\u0304\nb \u0101\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\nR=\n\n\u0012\n\nk \u2212l\u0304\nl k\u0304\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(A.9)\n\nL, R \u2208 SU (2) so |a|2 + |b|2 = |k|2 + |l|2 = 1. Thus we\nhave shown that SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) acts transitively on the\nbase. When (L, R) = (\u0398, \u0398\u2020 ) with\n\u0012 \u0131\u03b8\n\u0013\ne\n0\n\u0398 =\n,\n0 e\u2212\u0131\u03b8\nZ0 is left fixed. This means that we can identify\n(L, R) and (L\u0398, R\u0398\u2020 ), i.e. the base is the coset space\n3\nSU(2)\u00d7SU(2)\n\u00d7S 3\n= SU(1)\nwith topology S 2 \u00d7 S 3 and symmeU(1)\ntry group SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1).\nWe now turn to the discussion of the K\u00e4hler metric on\nthe singular conifold. The metric on a complex manifold\nis K\u00e4hler if and only if it can be written as\ng\u03bc\u03bd\u0304 = \u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bd F ,\nwhere F is the K\u00e4hler potential. If this potential is to be\ninvariant under the action of SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) it can only\nbe a function of r2 , so\n\nthe base has an especially useful description in terms of\nEuler angles. Choosing the following parametrisation of\nL and R in (A.9)\n\u03b81 2i (\u03c81 +\u03c61 )\n,\ne\n2\n\u03b81 i\nb = sin e 2 (\u03c81 \u2212\u03c61 ) ,\n2\n\na = cos\n\nwhere \u03c8i , \u03c6i , \u03b8i are the Euler angles of each SU (2), one\nobtains from (A.10)\n2\n2\nX\n1\n1X 2\ncos \u03b8i d\u03c6i )2 +\n(d\u03b81 +sin2 \u03b8i d\u03c62i ) .\n(d\u03c8+\n9\n6\ni=1\ni=1\n(A.14)\nThis form of the metric clearly shows the two spheres\n(\u03b8i , \u03c6i ) and the U (1) fibre over them, parametrised by\n\u03c8 = \u03c81 + \u03c82 . We also observe that the U (1) symmetry\n(discussed after (A.2)) manifests itself as a shift symmetry in \u03c8.\n\nds2T 1,1 =\n\n2. The deformed conifold\n\nOne way to repair the singularity of a conifold is by\ndeformation in which the defining equation (A.2) near\nr = 0 is replaced by\n4\nX\n\n(A.10)\n\nTo find the condition that our metric be in addition\nRicci flat, we need the Ricci tensor, which takes the form\nR\u03bc\u03bd\u0304 = \u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bd\u0304 ln(det g\u03bc\u03bd\u0304 ) on a K\u00e4hler manifold. Define a\nfunction\n\u03b3(r) = r2 F \u2032 ,\n\n(A.11)\n\nthen requiring Ricci flatness leads to\n\u03b3(r) = r4/3 .\n(A.12)\np\nAfter a rescaling r \u2192 r\u0303 = 3/2 r2/3 one recovers indeed\na metric of the form (A.1) from (A.10). The metric of\n\n(A.15)\n\nBy taking again the intersection with the three-sphere\nto find the base, one finds 2x2i = \u03bc2 + r2 , i.e. a finite\nS 3 remains at r = 0. This is called a deformed conifold.\nNote that the U (1) symmetry of the singular conifold\n(corresponding to a rotation zi \u2192 ei\u03b1 zi with constant\nphase \u03b1 for all i) is broken to a Z2 that sends zi \u2192 \u2212zi .\nIn terms of the matrix W as defined in (A.5) the deformed conifold is given by\ndet W = \u2212\u03bc2 /2\n\n2\n\nds2 = F \u2032 T r(dW \u2020 dW ) + F \u2032\u2032 |T r W \u2020 dW |2 .\n\nzi2 = \u03bc2 .\n\ni=1\n\ng\u03bc\u03bd\u0304 = (\u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bd\u0304 r2 )F \u2032 + (\u2202\u03bc r2 )(\u2202\u03bd\u0304 r2 )F \u2032\u2032 ,\nwhere the prime indicates a derivative with respect to r .\nIn terms of W\n\n\u03b82 2i (\u03c82 +\u03c62 )\n,\ne\n2\n\u03b82 i\n)\nl = sin e 2 (\u03c82 \u2212\u03c62(A.13)\n,\n2\nk = cos\n\nand as in (A.7) we define a radial co-ordinate via the\nrelation r2 = T r (W \u2020 W ). Splitting the zi into real and\nimaginary parts we obtain\nr2 =\n\n4\nX\ni=1\n\n(x2i + yi2 ) ,\n\n\u03bc2 =\n\n4\nX\ni=1\n\n(x2i \u2212 yi2 ) ,\n\n(A.16)\n\nwhich implies that r ranges from \u03bc to \u221e. But it is also\nclear that the deformed conifold is still the cotangent\nbundle over a three-sphere T \u2217 S 3 , only that the S 3 has\na minimal size; it never shrinks to zero. A particular\nsolution is found to be\n!\np\n\u03bc\n\u221a\nr 2 \u2212 \u03bc2\n2\nW\u03bc =\n(A.17)\n0\n\u2212 \u221a\u03bc2\n\n\f30\nand the general solution is obtained by setting W =\nL W\u03bc R\u2020 . For r 6= \u03bc the stability group is again U (1).\nSo for each r 6= \u03bc the surfaces r =constant are again\nS 2 \u00d7 S 3 . Note however, that for r = \u03bc the matrix W\u03bc\nis proportional to \u03c33 and is invariant under an entire\nSU (2). Thus, the \"origin\" of co-ordinates r = \u03bc is in\nfact an SU (2) = S 3 .\nAgain we define a K\u00e4hler potential F\u0302 and \u03b3\u0302 = r2 F\u0302 .\nThen the metric is given by (A.10) and the condition for\nRicci flatness becomes (Candelas and de la Ossa, 1990)\nr2 (r4 \u2212 \u03bc4 )(\u03b3\u0302 3 )\u2032 + 3\u03bc4 \u03b3\u0302 3 = 2r8 .\n\nds2def\n\n\u0014\n\nThis can be integrated and one finds that for r \u2192 \u221e the\nfunction \u03b3\u0302 approaches r4/3 , which agrees with the singular conifold solution. So asymptotically (for large r) the\ntwo spaces look the same. In terms of Euler angles (A.13)\nthe metric is explicitly given as (Minasian and Tsimpis,\n2000; Papadopoulos and Tseytlin, 2001) (see also\nOhta and Yokono (2000))\n\n(A.18)\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03bc4\ndr2\n1\n2\n=\n1 \u2212 4 + \u03b3\u0302\nr \u03b3\u0302 \u2212 \u03b3\u0302\n+ (d\u03c8 + cos \u03b81 d\u03c61 + cos \u03b82 d\u03c62 )\nr\nr2 (1 \u2212 \u03bc4 /r4 ) 4\n\u0003\n\u03b3\u0302 \u0002\n+\n(sin \u03b812 d\u03c621 + d\u03b812 ) + (sin \u03b822 d\u03c622 + d\u03b822 )\n4\n\u03b3\u0302\u03bc2\n+ 2 [cos \u03c8(d\u03b81 d\u03b82 \u2212 sin \u03b81 sin \u03b82 d\u03c61 d\u03c62 ) + sin \u03c8(sin \u03b81 d\u03c61 d\u03b82 + sin \u03b82 d\u03c62 d\u03b81 )] ,\n2r\n2 \u2032\n\n\u0001\n\nwhere we would still need to rescale r to ensure that \u03b3\u0302\nhas dimension r2 . Note that even the metric now shows\nthe absence of the U (1) symmetry formerly associated\nwith shifts in \u03c8. As stressed at the beginning of this\nsection, this is not an accident of the parametrisation we\nchose, but inherent to the defining equation (A.15) of the\ndeformed conifold.\n3. The resolved conifold\n\ndescribe a CP1 \u223c S 2 at the tip of the cone. Therefore,\nthe resolved conifold is depicted as O(\u22121) \u2295 O(\u22121) \u2192\nCP1 . We will work in a patch where \u03be2 /\u03be1 = \u03bb is a good\ninhomogeneous co-ordinate on CP1 . Hence\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2212u\u03bb u\n.\nW =\n\u2212y\u03bb y\n\n(A.26)\n\nThe radial co-ordinate is defined as in (A.4) and becomes\n\nAnother way to repair the conifold singularity is to\nresolve it by blowing up a two-sphere. Upon defining\nnew variables\nx\ny\nu\nv\n\n(A.19)\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nz1 + \u0131z2 ,\nz2 + \u0131z1 ,\nz3 \u2212 \u0131z4 ,\nz4 \u2212 \u0131z3 ,\n\n(A.20)\n(A.21)\n(A.22)\n(A.23)\n\nthe conifold equation (A.2) becomes\nxy \u2212 uv = 0 .\n\n(A.24)\n\nThis is equivalent to requiring non-trivial solutions to\n\u0013\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012\n\u03be1\nx u\n= 0,\n(A.25)\n\u03be2\nv y\nin which \u03be1 , \u03be2 are not both zero. So, for (u, v, x, y) 6= 0\n(away from the tip), they describe again a conifold. But\nat (u, v, x, y) = 0 this is solved by any pair (\u03be1 , \u03be2 ). Due\nto the overall scaling freedom (\u03be1 , \u03be2 ) \u223c (\u03bb\u03be1 , \u03bb\u03be2 ) we can\nmod out by this equivalence class and (\u03be1 , \u03be2 ) actually\n\nr2 = T r W \u2020 W = \u03c3\u039b,\n\n(A.27)\n\nwith \u03c3 = |u|2 + |y|2 and \u039b = 1 + |\u03bb|2 . The K\u00e4hler\npotential K in this case is not only a function of r2 , but\nK = Fe + 4a2 ln \u039b,\n\n(A.28)\n\nwith Fe a function of r2 and a a constant, the resolution\nparameter. This gives the metric on the resolved conifold\n|d\u03bb|2\nds2 = Fe\u2032 T r(dW \u2020 dW ) + Fe\u2032\u2032 |T r W \u2020 dW |2 + 4a2\n.\n\u039b2\n\nThis reduces to the singular conifold metric when a \u2192 0.\nWe again define \u03b3\ne = r2 Fe. Then Ricci flatness requires\n\u03b3\ne\u2032 \u03b3\ne(e\n\u03b3 + 4a2 ) = 2r2 /3 ,\n\n(A.29)\n\n\f31\nwhich can be solved for \u03b3\ne(r). In terms of the Euler angles\n(A.13) with \u03c8 = \u03c81 + \u03c82 , this metric was derived by\nPando Zayas and Tseytlin (2000) to be31\n\u2032\n\n\u00012\n\u03b3\ne 2\nr d\u03c8 + cos \u03b81 d\u03c61 + cos \u03b82 d\u03c62\n4\n\u0001\n\u03b3\ne\n2\n+ d\u03b81 + sin2 \u03b81 d\u03c621\n(A.30)\n4\n\u0001\n\u03b3\ne + 4a2\nd\u03b822 + sin2 \u03b82 d\u03c622 ,\n+\n4\n\nds2res = \u03b3\ne\u2032 dr2 +\n\nwith \u03b3\ne=\u03b3\ne(r) going to zero like r2 and e\n\u03b3 \u2032 = \u2202e\n\u03b3 /\u2202r2 . a is\ncalled the resolution parameter because it determines the\nsize of the blown up S 2 at r = 0. This shows very nicely\nthat the (\u03b82 , \u03c62 ) sphere is the only part of the metric that\nremains finite as we approach the tip at r = 0.\nIt is convenient to define a new radial co-ordinate via\n\u03c12 = 3/2 \u03b3. Using (A.29), the Ricci-flat metric with appropriate dimensions can be written as\nds2res =\n\n\u00012\n\u03ba(\u03c1) 2\n\u03c1 d\u03c8 + cos \u03b81 d\u03c61 + cos \u03b82 d\u03c62\n9\n\u0001\n\u03c13\n(A.31)\nd\u03b812 + sin2 \u03b81 d\u03c621\n+\n6\n2\n2\n\u0001\n\u03c1 + 6a\nd\u03b822 + sin2 \u03b82 d\u03c622 + \u03ba(\u03c1)\u22121 d\u03c12 ,\n+\n6\n\nwith \u03ba(\u03c1) = (\u03c12 + 9a2 )/(\u03c12 + 6a2 ). It is interesting that\nthere is another K\u00e4hler metric on the resolved conifold\nwhich is related to this one by a flop, basically corresponding to the exchange of the two S 2 .\n\nsponding two S 3 s, we choose left-invariant one-forms on\nthe conifold base:\n\u03c31\n\u03c32\n\u03c33\n\u03a31\n\u03a32\n\u03a33\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\ncos \u03c81 d\u03b81 + sin \u03c81 sin \u03b81 d\u03c61 ,\n\u2212 sin \u03c81 d\u03b81 + cos \u03c81 sin \u03b81 d\u03c61 ,\nd\u03c81 + cos \u03b81 d\u03c61 ,\ncos \u03c82 d\u03b82 + sin \u03c82 sin \u03b82 d\u03c62 ,\n\u2212 sin \u03c82 d\u03b82 + cos \u03c82 sin \u03b82 d\u03c62 ,\nd\u03c82 + cos \u03b82 d\u03c62 .\n\n(A.32)\n\nThey\nsatisfy\na\nMaurer\u2013Cartan\nequation\nd\u03c3i = \u2212i/2 \u01ebijk \u03c3j \u2227 \u03c3k and similarly for \u03a3i .\nPapadopoulos and Tseytlin (2001) used only five\nangles and \u03c81 = \u03c82 = \u03c8/2. This is sufficient for the\nsix-dimensional conifolds, but Cvetic et al. (2002b) lifted\nthese geometries to a unified solution in M-theory. It\nwas shown here that all three conifold geometries give\nrise to one G2 holonomy metric. The eleventh direction\nis identified with \u03c81 \u2212 \u03c82 and therefore the co-ordinate\nchoice \u03c81 + \u03c82 = \u03c8 and \u03c81 \u2212 \u03c82 = 0 can indeed be viewed\nas a dimensional reduction from 7 to 6 dimensions.\na. Singular conifold\n\nThe one-forms (A.32) give rise to vielbeins on the sixdimensional conifold:\nr\nr\ne1 = \u221a \u03c31 ,\ne2 = \u221a \u03c32 ,\n6\n6\nr\nr\ne 4 = \u221a \u03a32 ,\n(A.33)\ne 3 = \u221a \u03a31 ,\n6\n6\nr\ne5 =\n(\u03c33 + \u03a33 ), e6 = dr,\n3\nand the metric is diagonal in these vielbeins:\n\n4. Complex structures of conifolds\n\nIn this section we will explore a set of vielbeins that\ndoes not only give rise to the Ricci flat K\u00e4hler metric on all three conifold geometries, but also makes\nthe closed K\u00e4hler and holomorphic three-form apparent. We follow the convention of Cvetic et al. (2002b),\nwhich is very similar to Papadopoulos and Tseytlin\n(2001).\nBut note that the simpler set of vielbeins advocated by Klebanov and Strassler (2000) and\nMinasian and Tsimpis (2000) does not produce a closed\nholomorphic three-form for the deformed conifold. We\nassume that the reader is familiar with the basic concepts\nof complex differential geometry. A good introduction is\nfound for example in Nakahara (2003).\nThe vielbeins are deduced from the symmetry group\nSU (2) \u00d7 SU (2). In terms of Euler angles on the corre-\n\nds2 =\n\n6\nX\ni=1\n\n+\n\nAgain we have to rescale the radial co-ordinate such that e\n\u03b3 has\ndimension r 2 .\n\nX\nr2\ncos \u03b8i d\u03c6i )2\n(d\u03c8 +\n9\ni=1\n\n2\nr2 X 2\n(d\u03b8 + sin2 \u03b8i d\u03c62i ) .\n6 i=1 1\n\n(A.34)\n\nHere we identify \u03c8 = \u03c81 + \u03c82 . Note that the odd combination of \u03c81 \u2212 \u03c82 does not appear and we recover the\nby-now-familiar structure of the base \u2013 an S 2 fibred over\nan S 3 \u2013 although we started out with co-ordinates for\ntwo S 3 s.\nAn (almost) complex structure on this real sixdimensional manifold is defined by choosing complex vielbeins\nE1 = e1 + \u0131 e2 , E2 = e3 + \u0131 e4 , E3 = e5 + \u0131 e6 . (A.35)\nIn terms of these complex vielbeins, the fundamental twoform J and holomorphic three form \u03a9 are defined as\n\u0131\n(E1 \u2227 \u01121 + E2 \u2227 \u01122 + E3 \u2227 \u01123 )(A.36)\n2\n= E1 \u2227 E2 \u2227 E3 .\n(A.37)\n\nJ (1,1) =\n31\n\n2\n\ne2i = dr2 +\n\n\u03a9(3,0)\n\n\f32\nFor the singular conifold their co-ordinate expressions are\nstill fairly simple (again, only the even combination of \u03c81\nand \u03c82 appears):\n\nr\nr2\nJ = \u2212 dr \u2227 (d\u03c8 + cos \u03b81 d\u03c61 + cos \u03b82 d\u03c62 ) \u2212\n(sin \u03b81 d\u03c61 \u2227 d\u03b81 + sin \u03b82 d\u03c62 \u2227 d\u03b82 ) ,\n3\n6\nh\ni\n2\nr\n(cos \u03c8 \u2212 \u0131 sin \u03c8) dr \u2227 sin \u03b81 d\u03b82 \u2227 d\u03c61 \u2212 sin \u03b82 d\u03b81 \u2227 d\u03c62 + \u0131(d\u03b81 \u2227 d\u03b82 \u2212 sin \u03b81 sin \u03b82 d\u03c61 \u2227 d\u03c62 )\n\u03a9 =\n6\nh\nr3\n(cos \u03c8 \u2212 \u0131 sin \u03c8) d\u03b81 \u2227 d\u03b82 \u2227 (d\u03c8 + cos \u03b81 d\u03c61 + cos \u03b82 d\u03c62 ) \u2212 sin \u03b81 sin \u03b82 d\u03c61 \u2227 d\u03c62 \u2227 d\u03c8\n+\n18\ni\n\n\u2212\u0131(sin \u03b81 d\u03b82 \u2227 d\u03c61 \u2212 sin \u03b82 d\u03b81 \u2227 d\u03c62 ) \u2227 d\u03c8 \u2212 \u0131(sin \u03b81 cos \u03b82 d\u03b82 + cos \u03b81 sin \u03b82 d\u03b81 ) \u2227 d\u03c61 \u2227 d\u03c62 ,\n\nand one can easily show that\ndJ = 0\n\nand\n\nd\u03a9 = 0 .\n\n(A.38)\n\nTogether these relations imply that the almost complex\nstructure is actually integrable, so the closure of the fundamental two-form means that this manifold is K\u00e4hler.\nFor a K\u00e4hler manifold the closure of \u03a9 means furthermore that it is Calabi\u2013Yau (see e.g. Chiossi and Salamon\n(2002)).\nThe complex structure induced by these vielbeins is of\ncourse identical with the one coming from the holomorphic coordinates zi used in (A.2) to define the singular\nconifold. One finds that, up to a numerical factor, the\nholomorphic three\u2013form can also be expressed as\n\u03a9 =\n\ndz1 \u2227 dz2 \u2227 dz3\n,\nz4\n\n(A.39)\n\nwhich agrees with above coordinate expression if the\nholomorphic coordinates are parameterized as\n\u03b81\n2\n\u03b81\ncos\n2\n\u03b81\ncos\n2\n\u03b81\nsin\n2\n\nx = r3/2 e\u0131/2(\u03c8\u2212\u03c61 \u2212\u03c62 ) sin\ny = r3/2 e\u0131/2(\u03c8+\u03c61 +\u03c62 )\nu = r3/2 e\u0131/2(\u03c8+\u03c61 \u2212\u03c62 )\nv = r3/2 e\u0131/2(\u03c8\u2212\u03c61 +\u03c62 )\n\n\u03b82\n2\n\u03b82\ncos\n2\n\u03b82\nsin\n2\n\u03b82\ncos .\n2\nsin\n\n(A.40)\n\nWe also make use of the coordinate redefinition (A.20)\nto relate these coordinates to zi\n1\n(x \u2212 \u0131 y)\n2\n1\n=\n(x + \u0131 y)\n2\u0131\n1\n= (u + \u0131 v)\n2\n\u22121\n=\n(u \u2212 \u0131 v) .\n2\u0131\n\nz1 =\nz2\nz3\nz4\n\nFor practical computations these coordinates are not very\nuseful, as they are the homogeneous ones. The real coordinates make the structure of the six dimensional manifold much more transparent and the vielbeins serve as\na convenient basis for all sorts of differential forms, like\nfluxes.\n\nb. Resolved conifold\n\nThe same complex structure (A.35) can be used for\nthe resolved conifold. We only have to scale the vielbeins\naccording to the metric:\n\u03c1\ne1 = \u221a \u03c31 ,\n6\np\n\u03c12 + 6a2\n\u221a\n\u03a31 ,\ne3 =\n6\ns\n\u03c1 \u03c12 + 9a2\ne5 =\n(\u03c33 + \u03a33 ),\n3 \u03c12 + 6a2\n\n\u03c1\ne2 = \u221a \u03c32 , (A.41)\n6\np\n\u03c12 + 6a2\n\u221a\ne4 =\n\u03a32 ,\n6\ns\n\u03c12 + 6a2\ne6 =\nd\u03c1 ,\n\u03c12 + 9a2\n\nthen the metric remains diagonal and we recover (A.31)\nwith \u03c8 = \u03c81 + \u03c82 . The fundamental two-form (A.36) is\nfound to be\n\u03c1\n(A.42)\nJ = \u2212 d\u03c1 \u2227 (d\u03c8 + cos \u03b81 d\u03c61 + cos \u03b82 d\u03c62 )\n3\n\u03c12 + 6a2\n\u03c12\nsin \u03b81 d\u03c61 \u2227 d\u03b81 \u2212\nsin \u03b82 d\u03c62 \u2227 d\u03b82\n\u2212\n6\n6\nand is closed, as is the holomorphic three-form one obtains from (A.37):\n\n\f33\n\n\u03a9 =\n\nh\ni\n\u03c1(\u03c12 + 6a2 )\np\n(cos \u03c8 \u2212 i sin \u03c8) d\u03c1 \u2227 sin \u03b81 d\u03b82 \u2227 d\u03c61 \u2212 sin \u03b82 d\u03b81 \u2227 d\u03c62 + i(d\u03b81 \u2227 d\u03b82 \u2212 sin \u03b81 sin \u03b82 d\u03c61 \u2227 d\u03c62 )\n6 \u03c12 + 9a2\nh\n\u03c12 p 2\n+\n\u03c1 + 9a2 (cos \u03c8 \u2212 i sin \u03c8) d\u03b81 \u2227 d\u03b82 \u2227 (d\u03c8 + cos \u03b81 d\u03c61 + cos \u03b82 d\u03c62 ) \u2212 sin \u03b81 sin \u03b82 d\u03c61 \u2227 d\u03c62 \u2227 d\u03c8\n18\ni\n\u2212i(sin \u03b81 d\u03b82 \u2227 d\u03c61 \u2212 sin \u03b82 d\u03b81 \u2227 d\u03c62 ) \u2227 d\u03c8 \u2212 i(sin \u03b81 cos \u03b82 d\u03b82 + cos \u03b81 sin \u03b82 d\u03b81 ) \u2227 d\u03c61 \u2227 d\u03c62 .\n\nSo this complex structure also fulfills the Calabi\u2013Yau conditions.

To show that\nit is indeed closed one needs to make use of (A.18).\n\nFor the deformed conifold we can use the same holomorphic coordinates as for the singular conifold (A.40),\nbut the three\u2013form (A.39) now reads\ndz1 \u2227 dz2 \u2227 dz3\n\u03a9 = p\n.\n\u03bc2 \u2212 z12 \u2212 z22 \u2212 z32\n\n(A.48)\n\n\f34\nAs a side remark, let us note that the much simpler\nvielbeins from Klebanov and Strassler (2000):\ng1\ng2\ng3\ng4\ng5\ng6\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n\u2212 sin \u03b81 d\u03c61 ,\nd\u03b81 ,\n\u2212 sin \u03c8 d\u03b82 + cos \u03c8 sin \u03b82 d\u03c62 ,\ncos \u03c8 d\u03b82 + sin \u03c8 sin \u03b82 d\u03c62 ,\nd\u03c8 + cos \u03b81 d\u03c61 + cos \u03b82 d\u03c62 ,\ndr\n\n(A.49)\n\nwill never give a closed holomorphic three-form on the deformed conifold, even with a generic ansatz for a linear\ncombination of these vielbeins.32 In other words, they are\nnot compatible with the holomorphic coordinates (A.40).\nThey do work for the singular and resolved conifold, because they happen to give the same 2 and 3-forms. So\nthere is more than one choice of vielbeins that allows\nfor a Calabi\u2013Yau metric. However, if we wish to pass\nfrom one geometry to the other, we prefer to employ a\ncomplex structure that allows for all three of them to be\nCalabi\u2013Yau. The set of vielbeins (A.49) was also used\nby Minasian and Tsimpis (2000). Caution should therefore be used with their solutions, in particular from the\nviewpoint of supersymmetry.\n\nbeins that would give the right resolved metric (A.30) 33 ,\ni.e.\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\u01eb1 = \u221a d\u03b81 ,\n\u01eb2 = \u221a sin \u03b81 d\u03c61 ,\n6\n6\np\np\n2\n2\n\u03c1 + 6a\n\u03c12 + 6a2\n\u221a\n\u221a\nd\u03b82 , \u01eb4 =\nsin \u03b82 d\u03c62 ,\n\u01eb3 =\n6\n6\ns\n\u03c12 + 6a2\n\u01eb5 = \u2212\nd\u03c1,\n(A.51)\n\u03c12 + 9a2\ns\n\u03c1 \u03c12 + 9a2\n\u01eb6 =\n(d\u03c8 + cos \u03b81 d\u03c61 + cos \u03b82 d\u03c62 ),\n3 \u03c12 + 6a2\nand\nthen\nshow\nthat\nthe\nfluxes\nfrom\nPando Zayas and Tseytlin (2000) have not only a\n(2,1) but also a (1,2) part w.r.t. the complex structure:\nE1 = \u01eb1 + \u0131 \u01eb2 , E2 = \u01eb3 + \u0131 \u01eb4 , E3 = \u01eb5 + \u0131 \u01eb6 .\nNote, however, that this choice is not the right one to\nobserve the Calabi\u2013Yau property.

Fluxes on conifolds\n\nHaving studied the complex structure of conifold geometries, we can now turn to the question of what types\nof fluxes are allowed on them. In type IIB compactifications the background three-form flux G3 = F3 + \u03c4 H3\n(\u03c4 = C0 + ie\u2212\u03c6 is the axion-dilaton) has to obey a selfduality condition (Giddings et al., 2002)\n\u22176 G3 = iG3 ,\n\n(A.50)\n\nwhere \u22176 indicates the Hodge dual in 6 dimensions. Supersymmetry requires G3 to be of type (2,1) and primitive (Grana and Polchinski, 2001; Gubser, 2000), i.e.\nthat it satisfy G3 \u2227 J = 0. In Cvetic et al. (2003) it\nwas shown that the solution of Klebanov and Strassler\n(2000) for D5-branes on the singular conifold fulfills these\nrequirements, whereas the Pando Zayas and Tseytlin\n(2000) (PT) solution for D5-branes on the resolved conifold does not. The latter has a (1,2) part in addition to\nthe allowed (2,1).\nAlthough we agree with the result obtained by\nCvetic et al. (2003), we question the complex structure\nthey use. Following PT they take the simplest set of viel-\n\n32\n\nThis statement was confirmed with Mathematica for arbitrary\nr-dependent coefficients.\n\n+(sin \u03b81 cos \u03b82 d\u03b82 + cos \u03b81 sin \u03b82 d\u03b81 ) \u2227 d\u03c61 \u2227 d\u03c62\n\ni\n\nlacks the (cos \u03c8 \u2212 \u0131 sin \u03c8) terms compared to (A.43).

This statement remains true for\nthe singular conifold, so this complex structure should\n\n33\n\nNote that there is a typo in equation (6.5) of Cvetic et al.

(2003) should be\ntaken with a grain of salt.\nWe can use our knowledge from Section A.4 to\nfind out to which cohomology group the flux from\nPando Zayas and Tseytlin (2000) belongs. The imaginary self-dual 3-form flux G3 = F3 + iH3 found in\nPando Zayas and Tseytlin (2000) is given by34\nH3 = d\u03c1 \u2227 (F1\u2032 (\u03c1) sin \u03b81 d\u03b81 \u2227 d\u03c61\n+F2\u2032 (\u03c1) sin \u03b82 d\u03b82 \u2227 d\u03c62 )\n\n(A.52)\n\nand\nF3 = P (d\u03c8 + cos \u03b81 d\u03c61 + cos \u03b82 d\u03c62 ) \u2227\n(sin \u03b81 d\u03b81 \u2227 d\u03c61 \u2212 sin \u03b82 d\u03b82 \u2227 d\u03c62 ) , (A.53)\nwhere P is a constant (to ensure dF3 = 0) and F1\u2032 (\u03c1) and\nF2\u2032 (\u03c1) were determined from the equations of motion to\nbe\nF1\u2032 (\u03c1) = 3P\n\n\u03c12\n\n\u03c1\n,\n+ 9a2\n\nF2\u2032 (\u03c1) = \u22123P\n\n(\u03c12 + 6a2 )2\n.\n\u03c13 (\u03c12 + 9a2 )\n\nWe now use the vielbeins from Section A.4.b and invert\n(A.41) to solve for the co-ordinate differentials. We then\nfind the flux in terms of vielbeins\np\n18P \u03c12 + 6a2\np\n(e1 \u2227 e2 \u2227 e5 \u2212 \u0131 e3 \u2227 e4 \u2227 e6 )\nG3 =\n\u03c13 \u03c12 + 9a2\n18P (e3 \u2227 e4 \u2227 e5 \u2212 \u0131 e1 \u2227 e2 \u2227 e6 )\np\np\n.\n(A.54)\n\u2212\n\u03c1 \u03c12 + 6a2 \u03c12 + 9a2\nThe vielbein notation is extremely convenient to see that\nthis flux is indeed imaginary self-dual35 (remarkable since\nPT also used the wrong set of vielbeins). The Hodge dual\nis simply found by\n\u22176 (ei1 \u2227 ei2 \u2227 . . . \u2227 eik ) = \u01ebi1 i2 ...ik\n\nik+1 ...i6\n\neik+1 \u2227 . . . \u2227 ei6\n\u221a\nand does not involve any factors of g. We use the convention that \u01eb123456 = \u01eb123456 = 1. With the usual complex structure (A.35) the PT flux becomes\nG3 = \u2212\n\n9\u0131P\np\np\n\u00d7\n\u03c13 \u03c12 + 9a2 \u03c12 + 6a2\n\nh\n(\u03c12 + 3a2 ) (E1 \u2227 E3 \u2227 E 1 \u2212 E2 \u2227 E3 \u2227 E 2 )\ni\n\u22123a2 (E1 \u2227 E 1 \u2227 E 3 + E2 \u2227 E 2 \u2227 E 3 ) .(A.55)\n\n34\n\n35\n\nThis is a solution with constant dilaton, which can therefore be\nset to zero, and vanishing axion. Furthermore, there is a typo in\nequation (4.3) in (Pando Zayas and Tseytlin, 2000), concerning\nthe sign of F3 .\nThe self\u2013duality should really be checked w.r.t. the warped resolved conifold, but since we consider a 3\u2013form flux on a 6\u2013\ndimensional manifold, the appropriate factors of the warp factor\ndrop out when taking the Hodge dual.\n\nWe make several observations: This flux is neither primitive36 nor is it of type (2,1). It has a (1,2) and a (2,1)\npart. With just a (1,2) part present we could have made\nthis flux supersymmetric by a different choice of complex\nstructure. But as it stands, this flux indeed breaks supersymmetry, as claimed by Cvetic et al. (2003). Apart\nfrom that, in the limit a \u2192 0 the (1,2) part vanishes,\nthe flux becomes primitive and we recover the singular\nconifold. This seems to indicate that the resolution parameter forbids a supersymmetric supergravity solution\nfor wrapped D5-branes on the resolution in the presence\nof flux.\nLet us close this section by repeating the flux analysis for the KS model, which in the region away from\nthe tip agrees with the singular conifold solution first advocated by Klebanov and Tseytlin (2000) (KT). Again,\nwe agree with the result of Cvetic et al. (2003), but we\nmaintain that a complex structure that allows for a closed\nholomorphic 3-form on the singular conifold should have\nbeen used. We use the set (A.33) with the same complex\nstructure as in (A.35). The 3-form flux G3 = F3 + \u0131 H3\nwith\nM\n(d\u03c8 + cos \u03b81 d\u03c61 + cos \u03b82 d\u03c62 ) \u2227\n2\n(sin \u03b81 d\u03b81 \u2227 d\u03c61 \u2212 sin \u03b82 d\u03b82 \u2227 d\u03c62 ),\n3\ndr \u2227 (sin \u03b81 d\u03b81 \u2227 d\u03c61 \u2212 sin \u03b82 d\u03b82 \u2227 d\u03c62 ),\n=\n2M r\n\nF3 =\n\nH3\n\nbecomes\nG3 = \u2212\n\n9\u0131M\n(E1 \u2227 E3 \u2227 E 1 \u2212 E2 \u2227 E3 \u2227 E 2 ) , (A.56)\n2r3\n\nwhere M indicates the number of fractional D3-branes in\nthe KT model; see Section II.A.2. It is also easy to check\nthat this flux is indeed primitive (J \u2227 G3 = 0). Also, the\nresulting 5\u2013form flux F5 = dC4 + B2 \u2227 F3 can be made\nself\u2013dual by choosing\ndC4 = d(h\u22121 (r))\u2227dx0 \u2227...\u2227dx3 = \u221710 (B2 \u2227F3 ) , (A.57)\nwhere the 10\u2013dimensional Hodge dual is to be taken\nw.r.t. to the warped metric\nds2 = h\u22121/2 (r)\u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + h1/2 (r)(dr2 + r2 ds2T 1,1 ) .\nThus, we have confirmed that the KT model preserves\nsupersymmetry in the correct complex structure. We also\nsee that in the limit where the 2-cycle in the resolved\nconifold shrinks to zero, the flux in the PT solution agrees\nwith the singular conifold solution of KT.\n\n36\n\nP\nSince J = 2\u0131\ni (Ei \u2227 E i ) it follows immediately that J \u2227 G3 has\na nonvanishing E1 \u2227 E2 \u2227 E1 \u2227 E2 \u2227 E3 part that is proportional\nto a2 .\n\n\f36\nReferences\nAffleck, I., M.
