On the other hand, the Anthropic Principle self-imposes the facts in the universe from\nthe existence of the observer. This is in conflict with the first principle ambitions of the No-Boundary\nProposal. Workers often use the Anthropic Principle to select dimensionality of spacetime. However,\nwe show here certain models do not require this.\nIt is believed that, in M-theory, spacetime has ten or eleven dimensions, but six or seven dimensions are curved up, leaving four apparent dimensions we can observe. The orthodox argument for\nthis phenomenon is based on the Anthropic Principle [1]: there may exist five or more large dimensions, however only in the 4-dimensional nearly flat spacetime will the question be asked: \"Why is\nthe spacetime 4-dimensional?\"\nHowever, under a very reasonable ansatz in d = 11 supergravity, it is possible to show that\nthe nearly flat spacetime must be 4-dimensional. Here, in addition to fermion fields, a 3-index\nantisymmetric tensor AMN P is introduced into the theory by supersymmetry [2]. In the classical\nbackground of the W KB approximation, one sets the fermion fields to vanish. Then the action of\nthe bosonic fields can be written\nI \u0304 =\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\n\u2212g11\n\n!\n\u221a\n2\n1\n1\nM1 M2 ***M11\nMN P Q\nFM1 M2 M3 M4 FM5 M6 M7 M8 AM9 M10 M11 d11 x,\n\u03b7\nR \u2212 FMN P Q F\n+\n2\n48\n6 * (4!)2\n(1)\n\nwhere\nFMN P Q \u2261 4!\u2202[M AN P Q] ,\n\n(2)\n\n1\n\u01ebA***N\n\u03b7 A***N = \u221a\n\u2212g11\n\n(3)\n\nand R is the scalar curvature of the spacetime with metric signature (\u2212, +, +, * * * +).\nThe Kaluza-Klein ansatz we are using is that spacetime is a Lorentzian continuation of the\nproduct space of two spheres Sn \u00d7 S11\u2212n . It is assumed that all components of the F field with\nmixed indices in the two factor spaces are zero.\nThe field equations are\n1\n1\nRMN \u2212 RgMN =\n(8FMP QR FN P QR \u2212 gMN FSP QR F SP QR ),\n2\n48\nand\nQ\nF MN P;M\n\n\u221a #\n\u2212 2\n* \u03b7 M1 ***M8 N P Q FM1 ***M4 FM5 ***M8 .\n=\n2 * (4!)2\n\"\n\n2\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n\fIn the quantum cosmology scenario the Lorentzian evolution of the universe originates from a\ncompact instanton solution, i.e. a stationary action solution [3]. Under the ansatz, in the factor\nspace Sn (n = 1, 2, 3) the F components must be vanish due to the antisymmetry of the indices.\nThen F must be a harmonic in S11\u2212n since the right hand side of the field equation (5) vanishes.\nIt is known in de Rham cohomology that H 4 (S4 ) = 1 and H 4 (Sm ) = 0 (m 6= 4). So there is\nno nontrivial instanton for n = 1, 2, 3. For n = 5, 6, both F components in S5 and S6 must be\nharmonics and so vanish since the right hand side of (5) must be zero. By the dimensional duality,\na nontrivial instanton does not exist for n = 10, 9, 8. The case S4 \u00d7 S7 is the only possibility for the\nexistence of a nontrivial instanton, the F components must be a harmonic in S4 , but do not have\nto be in S7 . The no-boundary proposal and the ansatz are very strong, otherwise the nonzero F\ncomponents could live in open or closed n-dimensional factor spaces (4 \u2264 n \u2264 10), and no explicit\nrestriction is given to the dimensionality of the universe [4].\nFour compact instantons are known [5][6][7][8]. They are products of a 4-sphere and a round or\nsquashed 7-sphere. These spaces are distinguished by their symmetries from other infinitely many\nsolutions with the same F field. From now on, Greek letters run from 0 to 3 for the indices in S4\nand small Latin letters from 4 to 10 for the indices in S7 .\nOne can analytically continue the S7 or S4 space at the equator to form a 7- or 4-dimensional\nde Sitter or anti-de Sitter space, which is identified as our macroscopic spacetime, and the S4 or S7\nspace as the internal space. One may naively think, since in either case the seed instanton is the\nsame, that the creation of a macroscopic 7- or 4-dimensional universe should be equally likely. Now\nit is possible to show (15 years late!) that the apparent spacetime must be 4-dimensional without\nappealing to the Anthropic Principle [9].\nThe solutions of the F components in the S4 factor space must be\n\u221a\nF\u03bc\u03bd\u03c3\u03b4 = i\u03ba g4 \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c3\u03b4 ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere g4 is the determinant of the S4 metric and \u03ba is a constant. If the other F components are\nzero, then we obtain the Freund-Rubin model [5]. There the F field plays the role of an anisotropic\neffective cosmological constant, which is \u039b7 = \u03ba2 /3 for S7 and \u039b4 = \u22122\u03ba2 /3 for S4 , in the sense that\nRmn = \u039b7 gmn and R\u03bc\u03bd = \u039b4 g\u03bc\u03bd , respectively. The S4 space must have radius r4 = (3/\u039b4 )1/2 and\nmetric signature (\u2212, \u2212, \u2212, \u2212), while the S7 space is of radius r7 = (6/\u039b7 )1/2 and metric signature\n(+, +, * * * +).\n3\n\n\fThe S4 metric can be written\nds24\n\n3\nsin2\n= \u2212dt \u2212\n\u039b4\n2\n\nr\n\n!\n\u039b4\nt (d\u03c72 + sin2 \u03c7(d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 )).\n3\n\n(7)\n\nOne can obtain the 4-dimensional anti-de Sitter space through two steps. First, one has to analytically continue on a three surface where the metric is stationary. One can choose \u03c7 =\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\nas the\n\nsurface, set \u03c9 = i(\u03c7 \u2212 \u03c02 ), and then analytically continue the metric through the null surface at t = 0\ni\u03c0\n2\n\nand get the anti-de Sitter metric\n!\nr\n3\n\u039b\n4\nds24 = \u2212dt2 +\nsin2\nt (d\u03c12 + sinh2 \u03c1(d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 )).\n\u039b4\n3\n\nby redefining \u03c1 = \u03c9 +\n\n(8)\n\nThe relative probability of the creation, at the W KB level, is the exponential to the negative of\nthe Euclidean action of the instanton S7 \u00d7 S4\nP = \u03a8\u2217 * \u03a8 \u2248 exp(\u2212I),\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03a8 is the wave function of the configuration at the quantum transition. The configuration is\nthe metric and the matter field at the equator. I is the Euclidean action.\nIf we are living in the Lorentzian section of the 7-dimensional (4-dimensional) factor space with\nS4 (S7 ) as the internal space, then the Euclidean action I should take the form\n!\n\u221a\nZ\n1\n2i M1 M2 ***M11\n1\n\u221a\nMN P Q\nFM1 M2 M3 M4 FM5 M6 M7 M8 AM9 M10 M11 d11 x,\n\u03b7\nR \u2212 FMN P Q F\n+\nI = \u2212k\ng11\n2\n48\n6 * (4!)2\n(10)\nwhere k = 1(\u22121). This is obtained through analytical continuation from the Lorentzian section as\nin the usual 4-dimensional Euclidean quantum gravity. The choice of the value k is also supported\nby its cosmological implication. The \u2212 k2 R term in the action can be decomposed into the difference\nof the curvatures for the two factor spaces \u2212 k2 (R7 \u2212 R4 ). The negative sign in front of R7 (R4 ) is\nrequired so that the perturbation modes of the gravitational field in the S7 background would take\nthe minimum excitation state allowed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\nThe Euclidean action I of the AdS4 \u00d7 S7 space can be calculated [9]\nI=\n\n1 2\n\u03ba V7 V4 ,\n3\n\n(11)\n\nwhere V7 (V4 ) is the volume of S7 (S4 ).\nThe field equation (5) is derived from the action (1) for the condition that the tensor AMN P is\ngiven at the boundary. Therefore, if one uses the action (1) in the evaluation of the wave function\n4\n\n\fand the probability, then the induced metric and tensor A on it must be the configuration of the wave\nfunction. The wave function is expressed by a path integral over all histories with the configuration\nas the only boundary. In deriving Eq. (9), one adjoins the histories in the summation of the\nwave function to their time reversals at the equator to form a manifold without boundary and\ndiscontinuity.\nThe induced metric and scalar field (if there is any) at the equator will remain intact under the\ntime reversal operation. However, for other fields, one has to be cautious. This occurs to our AMN P\nfield. If one use AMN P as the argument for the wave function, then one has implicitly fixed the\ngauge condition and there must be a discontinuity at the equator \u03c7 =\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\nwhich cannot be fixed by\n\na gauge transformation.\nIn order for the instanton approach to be valid, one has to use the canonical conjugate representation. One can make a Fourier transform of the wave function \u03a8(hij , A123 ) to get the wave function\n\u03a8(hij , P 123 ),\n\u03a8((hij , P\n\n123\n\n1\n)=\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\neiA123 P\n\n123\n\n\u03a8(hij , A123 ).\n\n(12)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere P 123 is the canonical momentum conjugate to A123 . the only degree of freedom of the matter\ncontent under the minisuperspace ansatz is A123 for a specified gauge.\nThe discontinuity which occurs at the instanton equator is thus avoided using the momentum\nrepresentation. At the W KB level, the Fourier transform of the wave function is equivalent to the\nLegendre transform of the action. The Legendre transform has introduced an extra contribution\n\u22122A123 P 123 to the Euclidean action, where all quantities are in the Euclidean version, and the factor\n2 is due to the two sides of the equator in the adjoining. Then the effective action becomes [9]\n2\nIef f ect = \u2212 \u03ba2 V7 V4 .\n3\n\n(13)\n\nIf we consider the quantum transition to occur at the equator of S7 instead, using the same\nargument, then it turns out that the corresponding canonical momentum using the time coordinate\nin S7 vanishes, and the effective action should be the negative of (11).\nSince the creation probability is the exponential to the negative of the Euclidean action, the\nprobability of creating a 7-dimensional macroscopic universe is exponentially suppressed relative to\nthat of the 4-dimensional case.\nIn the classical framework, the S7 factor space in the Freund-Rubin model can be replaced by\n\n5\n\n\fS2 \u00d7 S5 , S2 \u00d7 S2 \u00d7 S3 , S4 \u00d7 S3 or other Einstein spaces. However, all these product spaces have\nvolumes smaller than that of S7 . This would lead to an exponential suppression of the creation\nprobability. Therefore, the internal space must be the round S7 space.\nIn the Freund-Rubin model, the S7 factor space can be replaced by a general Einstein space\nwith the same cosmological constant \u039b7 . Among them, the Awada-Duff-Pope model [7] is most\ninteresting, where the round 7-sphere is replaced by a squashed one. As far as the scenario of\nquantum creation is concerned , the argument for the Freund-Rubin model remains intact; the only\nalternations are that the quantum transition should occur at one of its stationary equators and V7\nshould be the volume of the squashed 7-sphere.\nThe same argument applies to the Englert model [6]. There, in addition to the F components\nof the space S4 in (6), the Fmnpq components of the S7 space are non-vanishing. As in the FreundRubin model, before we take account of the Legendre term, the Euclidean action of the Englert\nAdS4 \u00d7 S7 space is [9]\n\n1\nI = \u2212 \u03ba2 V7 V4 .\n4\n\n(14)\n\nAfter including the Legendre term the effective action becomes [9]\n2\nIef f ect = \u2212 \u03ba2 V7 V4 .\n3\n\n(15)\n\nIf the quantum transition occurred at an equator of the S7 space, one has to include the Legendre\nterms correspondingly. In contrast to the Freund-Rubin model, the canonical momenta do not\nvanish. Fortunately, due to the symmetries of the momenta, the sum of the C63 = 20 Legendre terms\ncancel exactly. The action is the negative of that in (14). Again, one can conclude that the universe\nwe are living is most likely 4-dimensional.\nEnglert, Rooman and Spindel also discussed the model with a squashed S7 factor space [8]. It is\nbelieved that our conclusion should remain the same.\nThe right configuration for the wave function has also been chosen in the problem of quantum\ncreation of magnetic and electric black holes [10]. If one considers the quantum creation of a general\ncharged and rotating black hole, this point is even more critical. It is become so acute that unless\nthe right configuration is used, one cannot even find a constrained instanton seed [11].\nFor d = 11 supergravity, there is no way to discriminate the d = 4 and d = 7 macroscopic universes in the classical framework, as in other similar but more artificial models. This discrimination\n\n6\n\n\fcan be realized only through quantum cosmology.\nNow, it seems that one can dispel the Anthropic Principle so far as the dimensionality of the\nspacetime is concerned. Can we show the Anthropic Principle is not required at all?\nReferences:\n1. Hawking S W 2001 The Universe in a Nutshell (Bantam Books, New York)chap 3\n2. Cremmer E, Julia B and Scherk J 1978 Phys.
