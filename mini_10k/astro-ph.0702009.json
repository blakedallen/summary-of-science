These Fanaroff-Riley type\nII radio galaxies (Fanaroff & Riley 1974) are thought to be powered by narrow collimated\njets, terminating in high surface brightness regions called 'hotspots'. Regions of low surface\nbrightness emission lying between the galaxy center and the hotspots, called radio bridges,\nare believed to be a result of the accumulation of relativistic particles accelerated at the\nhotspots over the lifetime of an FRII source that form a low-density cocoon around the jet\n(see Begelman et al. 1984, for a theoretical review). The ultimate motivation of our project\nis to study the radio bridges in FRII radio galaxies and do a spectral aging analysis. In this\npaper we present the first results of our study and describe the global properties of our FRII\nradio galaxy sample.\nIn order to comprehend the phenomenology of FRII galaxies, large samples of radio\ngalaxies have hitherto been observed, yielding an extensive database of information. Results from arcsecond-scale radio observations of FRII radio galaxies have been presented\nby many authors, for example, Laing (1981); Leahy & Williams (1984); Alexander & Leahy\n(1987); Leahy et al. (1989); Pedelty et al. (1989); Garrington et al. (1991); Liu et al. (1992);\nHardcastle et al. (1998); Ishwara-Chandra et al. (2001); Goodlet et al. (2004); Gilbert et al.\n(2004) and Mullin et al. (2006), and others. Previous studies of the radio bridges have included relatively low-resolution observations (\u223c 3\u2032\u2032 \u2212 4\u2032\u2032 ) at 151 MHz and 1.4 GHz of the full\nbridge region (e.g., Leahy et al. 1989), while the higher resolution observations (\u223c 1\u2032\u2032 ) at 1.4,\n5 and 15 GHz have sampled the bridge emission partially (e.g., Liu et al. 1992). However,\nto empirically address and understand the different physical processes that are important\nat different radio frequencies, physical locations, and stages of evolution of a source, both\nlow-frequency radio data and high-resolution radio data are required.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nTo this end, we observed 13 FRII radio galaxies with the Very Large Array (VLA)\nin multiple configurations at 330 MHz, 1.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 8 GHz. Here we present\nimages of the total and polarized radio intensity, spectral index between 1.4 and 5 GHz,\n0.3 and 1.4 GHz, and rotation measure between 1.4 and 5 GHz1 . Further, we probe the\nrelationship between different global characteristics of the radio galaxies by augmenting our\ndata with additional galaxy data gleaned from the literature. We will subsequently refer to\nthis extended, eclectic sample as the \"combined\" dataset, while the 13 FRII galaxies will be\nreferred to as such.\nThe paper is arranged as follows: the radio galaxy sample is described in Sect. 2 while the\nobservations and data reduction are discussed in Sect. 3; the source properties are presented\nin Sect. 4; the correlations are discussed in Sect. 5; and the summary and conclusions follow in\nSect. 6. This paper is the first in a series of four papers. In Paper II, we will present the results\nof the spectral aging analysis, lobe propagation velocities, pressures, beam powers, and\nambient gas densities. In Paper III, we will describe the use of these sources for cosmological\nstudies and present the results for a large sample of powerful FRII galaxies. Finally, in Paper\nIV, we will present a detailed analysis of the radio bridge structure of the sources.\nThroughout the paper, we have adopted the cosmology in which H0 =71 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ,\n\u03a9m =0.27 and \u03a9\u039b =0.73. The spectral indices \u03b1 are defined such that the flux density S\u03bd at\nfrequency \u03bd, is S\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u2212\u03b1 .\n2.\n\nTHE SAMPLE\n\nThe FRII radio galaxies considered for the present study are part of the 3CR sample\nof radio sources (Bennett 1962). The 13 sources which are a focus of this paper were those\nfor which we were alloctated observing time, from a larger sample of powerful FRII sources\nselected for an extensive study of their radio bridges. These sources satisfy the following\ncriteria: their radio power at 178 MHz is greater than 1028 W Hz\u22121 ; their angular sizes are\nlarger than 27\u2032\u2032 , they span the redshift range of z \u2243 0.4\u20131.65, and are classified as narrow-line\nFRII radio galaxies (Hes et al. 1996; Jackson & Rawlings 1997). The largest source in our\nsample, 3C172, has an angular extent of > 100\u2032\u2032 , which corresponds to a linear size of \u2243 680\nkpc. The large angular sizes ensure that the radio lobes span several beam widths, crucial\nfor the spectral aging study, which will be presented in Paper II. A compilation of the basic\nparameters for each source is given in Table 1.\n\n1\n\nSpectral index and RM maps are available only in the electronic version\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n\nTable 1.

Table 2 provides a summary of the VLA observations. The sources\nwere observed in a \u223c10 min snapshot mode. In order to be able to extract possible radio\nfrequency interference, which can become significant at low frequencies, the 330 MHz data\nwere observed in the spectral-channel mode. While making the radio maps at 330 MHz, only\nthe central 80% of the spectral channels were averaged. Scheduling constraints resulted in\nsome sources not being observed at some frequencies. For a few sources, VLA archival data\nexisted at one or more frequencies and these were not observed (see Table 3). We used the\nVLA archival data for these sources, the program IDs of which are listed in Table 3.\nThe data were reduced using the standard calibration and reduction procedures in the\nAstronomical Image Processing System (AIPS). 3C48 was used as the primary flux density\ncalibrator for the experiment. The instrumental polarization and electric vector position\nangles were calibrated using 0217+738 and 3C138, respectively. The polarization data at\n1.4 GHz were corrected for ionospheric Faraday rotation using the total electron content\nmaps available at CDDIS data archive2 in the AIPS task TECOR.\nAfter the initial amplitude and phase calibration using the calibrators, the source data\nwere phase and amplitude self-calibrated (Schwab 1980) and imaged in an iterative manner,\nusing the tasks CALIB and IMAGR. In order to improve the UV coverage, we combined\nthe self-calibrated datasets from the various configurations at a given frequency using the\nAIPS task DBCON, and performed additional rounds of phase and amplitude self-calibration\non the combined datasets. Table 2 lists the largest angular scale structure which can be\nimaged well in single snapshot observations with the different VLA configurations. A quick\ncomparison with the angular sizes of our 13 FRII galaxies listed in Table 1 demonstrates\nthat our sources were imaged reasonably well when the data from A, B and C-arrays were\ncombined at the L-band, B, C and D-arrays were combined at the C-band, and A and\nC-arrays were combined at the P-band.\nThe polarization maps were made by combining the Stokes Q and U images using the\nAIPS task COMB. We split our L-band data into its constituent Intermediate frequencies\n(IFs, see Table 2) and used the lower frequency, ie., 1345 MHz and the averaged C-band\ndata at 4860 MHz, to create the spectral index maps using the AIPS task COMB. For the\nrotation measure maps, we used the three frequencies, 1345, 1665 and 4860 MHz, in the\n2\n\nftp cddisa.gsfc.nasa.gov\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nAIPS task RM. When archival data were used, we could still combine the respective L-band\nIFs, which sometimes differed from our frequencies, to the closest frequency in our data.\nFor 3C142.1 we noticed RM flips across the southern lobe, which were a result of the n\u03c0\nambiguity in the polarization angles. We therefore used a guess (integrated) RM value of\n+84 rad m\u22122 (Simard-Normandin et al. 1981) in the AIPS task RM for the rotation measure\nmap of 3C142.1.\nWe typically recover 95% to 100% of the integrated flux density listed in Kuehr et al.\n(1996) at the L and C-bands. For 3C441 and 3C469.1, between 85% and 90% of the integrated\nflux density is recovered in our maps. The registration of images for the spectral index and\nrotation measure maps is better than \u223c 0.1\u2032\u2032 . By blanking values in the task COMB, the\npolarization intensity, polarization angle and fractional polarization maps were restricted to\nhave S/N> 3, output errors less than \u224810 degrees and 10%, respectively. No Ricean bias\ncorrection (e.g., Wardle & Kronberg 1974) was made to the polarized intensity. The mean\nrotation measure and the dispersion/spread in rotation measure, \u03c3RM was obtained by using\nthe AIPS task IMEAN.\n\n4.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe final maps at 1.4 GHz and 5 GHz, restored with a 2.0\u2032\u2032 or 2.5\u2032\u2032 circular Gaussian\nbeam, the 330 MHz maps restored with a 5.0\u2032\u2032 circular Gaussian beam, and the 8 GHz maps\nwith insets for the hotspots, are presented in Figs. 13 to 49. The total intensity contours\nare superimposed with the fractional polarization vectors. 1.4 GHz polarization maps could\nnot be made for 3C6.1 and 3C41 because their respective (archival) datasets did not include\nscans of a polarization angle calibrator. The dynamic range in the final images (defined as\npeak brightness/rms noise) varies from 7400 to 400, being typically greater than 3000. The\n1.4\u22125 GHz spectral index and RM maps were made at a resolution of 2.0\u2032\u2032 or 2.5\u2032\u2032 , while the\n0.3\u22121.4 GHz spectral index maps were made at a resolution of 5.0\u2032\u2032 .\nThe high resolution A-array 8 GHz images reveal the details of the hotspot structure.\nMost sources show the presence of multiple hotspots. These could be due to the plasma\nbeam moving about along the cavity wall as in the 'dentist's drill' model (Scheuer 1982).\nAlternatively, multiple hotspots could be interpreted as 'splatter-spots' formed by a jet with\na variable direction (Williams & Gull 1985). Table 6 presents selected characteristics of the\nhotspots in our 13 FRII galaxies. Our high-resolution 8 GHz images reveal that the brightest\nhotspots at either end, which probably are the current acceleration sites of particles, lie\nroughly along a line connecting the hotspots and the core for each of the 13 sources.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n\nTable 2.

Therefore, more sensitive observations are required to detect the radio bridges in these sources. The spectral index maps\nshow a gradual steepening of the radio spectra away from the hotspots with some spectral\nindex variations superimposed, in agreement with previous studies (e.g., Myers & Spangler\n1985; Alexander 1987; Alexander & Leahy 1987). Some quantitative estimates of the radio\nlobe properties are tabulated in Table 5.\nThe majority of the sources exhibit a regular bridge structure, with some distortions\nbecoming apparent at very low surface brightness. We have classified distortions using\nthe radio morphology classification of Leahy & Williams (1984): Type 1 (hereafter LW1)\nmorphology describes a bridge with no distortions but a marked decrease in the bridge\nsurface-brightness towards the centre; Type 2 (hereafter LW2) describes a bridge which\nbends away from the central galaxy only on one side; Type 3 (LW3) describes a bridge\nwhich bends away from the galaxy on both sides in a cross-shape; Type 4 (LW4) is a radio\nbridge which bends on both sides in the same direction away from the host galaxy; and\nType 5 (LW5) describes a bridge that is continuous across the galaxy which is displaced\ntowards the steepest edge of the radio source. The bridge types are presented in Table 5.\nThe radio core prominence (Rc ) is the ratio of the flux density from the radio core\n(Score ) to the extended radio lobe emission (Sext ). In the restframe of the source, Rc =\nScore\n(1 + z)\u03b1core \u2212\u03b1ext , where z is the redshift of the source, and \u03b1 is the spectral index,\nSext\nassumed to be 0 and 1 for the core and extended emission, respectively. Due to Doppler\nbeaming effects in the radio core (which is the unresolved base of the relativistic jet), Rc\ncan be used as a statistical indicator of beaming and therefore orientation (Kapahi & Saikia\n1982; Orr & Browne 1982). We have derived Rc using the radio core flux densities from the\nhigh-resolution 8 GHz maps (where the core is clearly delineated) and lobe flux densities\nfrom the 1.4 GHz maps (see Table 4). The lobe flux density is primarily all the extended\nradio emission minus the radio core, and therefore includes the emission from the hotspots\nand jets. We find that the core prominence in our 13 FRII radio galaxies is small \u2013 Rc varies\nfrom 4.7\u00d710\u22125 to 0.0029. This is consistent with the picture of these radio galaxies oriented\nclose to the plane of the sky.\nIn Table 5 we have tabulated the mean values of the rotation measure (RM) and the\ncorresponding dispersion (\u03c3RM ) in the radio lobes of our 13 FRII galaxies. The mean RM\nwas averaged over the two lobes. We have estimated the lobe depolarization parameter,\nml\nDP , as DP = m\n, where mh , ml are the fractional polarizations at high and low frequencies,\nh\nrespectively. A higher value of DP implies lower depolarization. We created DP maps using\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nthe lower frequency L-band (IF1) and the C-band fractional polarization maps in AIPS using\nthe task COMB. We used these maps to obtain a mean lobe DP by putting a box around\neach lobe (using AIPS verbs TVWIN and IMSTAT).\nNote that a few sources have DP > 1. While the degree of polarization will occasionally\nincrease with wavelength by chance due to Faraday effects, a close examination of our maps\nrevealed that the high DP values were mostly obtained for those sources which showed\npolarization at 1.4 GHz only in the hotspots, where the systematic errors are expected\nto be the highest (e.g., 3C13, 3C54-North, 3C469.1-North, 3C470). Residual instrumental\npolarization errors and errors in the position-angle zero-point contribute to the total error\nin DP , especially since data from multiple configurations has been combined to get the\npolarization maps. The DP errors quoted in Table 5 were estimated by taking the difference\nin the DP obtained using the L-band IF1 or IF2, and the C-band, respectively. In our\ndiscussions of lobe depolarization we have therefore excluded all values of DP that are not\nestimated over the radio lobes.\nThe spectral index for the lobes in Table 5 was obtained by putting a box around the lobe\nin the spectral index map and getting a mean value. The hotspot spectral index was taken\nas the value in this map corresponding to the total intensity peak position at the hotspot.\nThe arm-length ratio (Q) is the ratio of the angular extent of the larger radio lobe (core to\nhotspot) to the smaller. Another fundamental structural parameter is the axial ratio (AR),\nwhich is the ratio of the length to width of the radio lobe. The axial ratio was estimated for\nour radio galaxies following Leahy & Williams (1984) - the width was estimated of a section\n\u221a\nof the radio lobe roughly half-way between the hotspot and the core and defined as 2/ 3\ntimes the FWHM of the Gaussian function fitted to the lobe surface brightness. We used\nthe 1.4 GHz maps to get the widths and the 8 GHz maps to get accurate lengths. Table 5\npresents the arm-length and axial ratios for the sample FRII radio galaxies.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n\nTable 4.

The additional data comes primarily\nfrom Leahy & Williams (1984); Leahy et al. (1989); Pedelty et al. (1989); Garrington et al.\n(1991); Liu & Pooley (1991b); Hardcastle et al. (1998) and Goodlet et al. (2004) (see Table 7). We emphasize here that the data from the literature is inhomogeneous and chosen on\nthe basis of the availabilty of the relevant physical parameters that we wished to examine in\nsamples of (primarily 3C) FRII radio galaxies observed at a resolution of a few arcseconds.\nWe have excluded radio-loud quasars from our analysis, and restricted our selection to powerful FRII radio galaxies at a redshift-range matching our sample. The combined dataset\nincludes a few broad-line radio galaxies.\nWhen not listed explicitly in the above-mentioned references, the arm-length ratios and\nmisalignment angles were directly estimated (using a ruler and protractor) from the maps\npresented in these papers. Therefore, the angle estimates have errors of the order of a few\ndegrees, while the error in the arm-length ratios is expected to be less than 10%. When no\nradio core was observed in the maps, the position of the centre of the host galaxy was used\nfor the core position. The host galaxy positions were procured either from the papers directly\nor through the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED)3 . For the 13 FRIIs, radio core\nprominence was derived using the 8 GHz core and 1.4 GHz lobe flux densities. If similar\ndata were not available in the literature, we converted flux densities from other frequencies\nto 1.4 GHz for lobe and 8 GHz for core emission by assuming a spectral index of 1 and 0\nrespectively.\n3\n\nhttp://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/\n\n\fTable 5.

We find that our 13 FRII radio\ngalaxies follow the same trend. In Fig. 1 we have plotted the hotspot size (of the brighest\nhotspot at each end) against the core-hotspot distance. Here we have considered only the\n8 GHz measurements for the hotspot sizes from Hardcastle et al. (1998) and excluded the\nbroad-line radio galaxies from the analysis. The size of an individual hotspot was defined as\nthe geometric mean of the largest and smallest angular sizes (see Table 6).\nUsing the least absolute deviation method (implemented in the LADFIT routine in\nIDL), we fitted a linear model in the log-log space to the combined dataset and obtained\na slope of 0.72\u00b10.06. Note that by fitting a linear model to the combined dataset using\nchi-square minimization (implemented in the LINFIT routine in IDL), we obtain a slope of\n0.52\u00b10.08 (Perucho & Mart\u0131\u0301 (2003) have found the slope of the radio galaxy correlation to\nbe 0.40\u00b10.11). However since the use of the chi-square error statistic can result in a poor\nfit due to an undesired sensitivity to outlying data, we consider the slope of the correlation\nto be close to 0.7. Thus the following relation holds for the hotspot-size rh and core-hotspot\ndistance l of the radio galaxy: rh \u221d l0.7 .\nThis correlation provides support for suggestions that the hotspot sizes scale with source\nlinear size (see Hardcastle et al. 1998; Laing 1989; Bridle et al. 1994). This is consistent with\nthe hotspot maintaining ram pressure balance as the source propagates through a medium\nwith declining ambient density (Carvalho & O'Dea 2002b). Carvalho & O'Dea (2002a,b)\ndiscuss the results of two-dimensional axisymmetric numerical simulations of light, supersonic jets propagating into different density atmospheres and compare them with the predictions of three types of self-similar models. Of the self-similar models discussed, type\nI corresponds to the jet moving with a constant speed in a constant density atmosphere\n(e.g., Begelman & Cioffi 1989; Daly 1990); the type II model corresponds to jet motion in a\nmedium where the ambient density falls off as d\u22122 (e.g., Daly 1990), where d is the distance\nfrom the source; while the type III model assumes a power-law density distribution with an\nexponent \u03b4 (e.g., Kaiser & Alexander 1997).\nFollowing the relations between hotspot size, expansion time and the core-hotspot distance for type III models in Carvalho & O'Dea (2002a), i.e., rh2 \u221d t(\u03b4+4)/(5\u2212\u03b4) and l \u221d t3/(5\u2212\u03b4) ,\nthe derived exponent of 0.7 for the rh \u2212 l relation translates to a \u03b4 of 0.2. This implies that\nthe jet propagates in a nearly constant ambient density medium (\u03c1a \u221d d\u22120.2 ). This inference is consistent with the sources being located in the cores of protoclusters or clusters of\ngalaxies, which have a roughly constant ambient gas density. Indeed, a couple of our 13\nFRII radio galaxies seem to reside in such environments (see notes on individual sources in\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nthe Appendix). This is supported by the previous studies of Cygnus A (Carilli et al. 1991),\n3C295 (Perley & Taylor 1991), and the study of Wellman et al. (1997). Finally, with a \u03b4\nof 0.2, the hotspot advance speed is proportional to t\u22120.4 , thereby implying a decelerating\nsource.\n\n1.6\n\n1.0\n1.2\n0.5\n\u03b1HS\n\nLog hotspot size (kpc)\n\n1.5\n\n0.8\n\n0.0\n0.4\n\n-0.5\n-1.0\n1.0\n\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\nLog Core-HS dist (kpc)\n\n3.0\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\nRedshift\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\nFig. 1.- (Left) Log-log plot of the hotspot size versus the core-hotspot distance of the\nsources.

This is consistent with the findings of\nWellman et al. (1997); Dennett-Thorpe et al. (1999); Blundell et al. (1999) and Ishwara-Chandra & Saikia\n(2000). We find that the following approximate relation holds \u2013 \u03b1HS \u221d z 0.4 , with the absolute deviation in the exponent being \u223c0.03. Note that the \u03b1HS for our sources and from\nGarrington et al. (1991) have been estimated between 1.4 and 5 GHz, while the spectral\nindex from Leahy et al. (1989) were derived between 151 MHz and 1.4 GHz. Excluding\nthe data from Leahy et al. (1989) yields a slope of 0.43\u00b10.04. The chi-square minimization\nmethod (LINFIT in IDL) results in a slope of 0.22\u00b10.05 for all the data, and 0.26\u00b10.07\nwhen the data from Leahy et al.

(2004), diamonds from Garrington et al. (1991). (Right) Hotspot\nspectral index versus lobe spectral index for our 13 FRII radio galaxies.\nA correlation between spectral index and redshift is already well established for the\nintegrated extended emission in FRII galaxies (e.g., Laing & Peacock 1980; Chambers et al.\n1990; Athreya & Kapahi 1999; De Breuck et al. 2000). In Fig. 2, we have plotted the z \u2212 \u03b1\ncorrelation for our combined radio galaxy dataset. We do not find a correlation between the\nspectral index difference between the lobes and redshift, consistent with Goodlet & Kaiser\n(2005).\nIt has been pointed out that although a simple redshifting of the curved spectrum\ncontributes to the z \u2212 \u03b1 relation (e.g., Gopal-Krishna 1988; Lacy et al. 1993), it cannot\naccount for the whole effect (e.g., Lacy et al. 1993; Blundell et al. 1999). It has been proposed\nthat the hotspot spectral index is affected by inverse-Compton cooling owing to scattering\nwith microwave background photons, which is a strong function of redshift (e.g., Rees & Setti\n1968; Krolik & Chen 1991; Wellman et al. 1997). It has also been suggested that enhanced\nsynchrotron losses in more powerful hotspots could also produce a spectral steepening at\nhigher luminosity (e.g., Blundell et al. 1999; Dennett-Thorpe et al. 1999). Blundell et al.\n(1999) had examined three complete samples with successively fainter flux-limits, in order to\nbreak the luminosity-redshift degeneracy. They reached the conclusion that the rest-frame\nspectral indices have a stronger dependence on luminosity than on redshift, except at GHz\nfrequencies. Based on the finding that the extremely steep-spectrum radio galaxies in the\nlocal universe inevitably reside at the centres of rich galaxy clusters (e.g., Baldwin & Scott\n1973), Klamer et al. (2006) have postulated that z \u2212 \u03b1 correlation could be a result of a\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nhigher fraction of radio galaxies being located, as a function of redshift, in environments\nwith densities similar to nearby rich clusters.\nThe hotspot spectral index correlates with the lobe spectral index (Fig. 2 Right). Further, the lobe spectral index is systematically steeper than the hotspot spectral index. These\ntwo results provide support to the spectral aging model in the radio lobes. Electrons are injected into the lobe with the spectral index of the hotspots. They subsequently age, making\nthe spectra steeper.\n\n5.4.\n\nThe Rotation Measures and Dispersion\n\nThe mean rotation measure (RM) across the lobes of 11 of our 13 FRIIs varies from \u223c\n10\u221280 rad m\u22122 . On comparison with integrated RM measurements of Simard-Normandin et al.\n(1981), we find that our observed RM values are comparable to that expected from our\nGalaxy. The error in the rotation measure is typically less than 5 rad m\u22122 . The rotation\nmeasure dispersion (\u03c3RM ) is typically less than 20 rad m\u22122 for our sources. For two of the\nsources with \u03c3RM greater than 30 rad m\u22122 , viz., 3C13 and 3C470, large systematic errors\nwere probably present in their bright hotspots.\n\n50\n100\nRM Dispersion (rad m-2 )\n\nAbsolute Rotation Measure (rad m-2 )\n\n120\n\n80\n60\n40\n\n30\n20\n10\n\n20\n0\n0\n\n40\n\n20\n40\n60\nAbsolute Galactic Latitude (deg)\n\n80\n\n0\n0\n\n20\n40\n60\nAbsolute Galactic Latitude (deg)\n\n80\n\nFig. 3.- (Left) The absolute mean rotation measure for each of the two radio lobes versus\nthe absolute Galactic latitude.

(1989) and\nGarrington et al. (1991), respectively.\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nPedelty et al. (1989) had found a weak correlation between the rotation measures across\nthe radio lobes and source Galactic latitudes, with the higher values of rotation measure\noccuring at lower Galactic latitudes. We find that such a correlation is significant at the\n99% level (Spearman-Rank and Kendall's-tau correlation tests) for the combined radio galaxy\ndataset (Fig. 3). The rotation measure dispersion and Galactic latitude are not correlated\n(see Table 8). These results suggest that the large-scale rotation measure is likely dominated\nby the Galactic foreground, whereas the small-scale structure in rotation measure (\u03c3RM ) is\nproduced in the source and/or its environment for these relatively high latitude sources (eg.,\nKronberg et al. 1972; Simonetti et al. 1984; Leahy 1987).\n\nDP\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n30\n\u03c3 RM (rad m-2 )\n\n40\n\n50\n\nFig. 4.- The two depolarization parameters DP and \u03c3RM plotted against each other.\nFilled circles denote our sample FRII radio galaxies while crosses denote radio galaxies from\nGoodlet et al. (2004).\nFigure 4 shows the rotation measure dispersion plotted against the depolarization measure. We find no correlation between these two parameters (see Table 8). The lack of a\ncorrelation is consistent with the possibility that both the RM dispersion and depolarization\nresult from a partially resolved foreground screen, associated with the radio source but in\nfront of it (Tribble 1991; Johnson et al. 1995; Goodlet & Kaiser 2005). However this cannot\nbe demonstrated unequivocally for these sources.\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\n5.5.\n\nThe Depolarization Asymmetry in Radio Lobes\n\nSeveral strong correlations have been observed with lobe depolarization asymmetries in\nFRII radio galaxies. In sources with strong one-sided jets, the jet side tends to depolarize less\nrapidly with increasing wavelength, also referred to as the 'Laing-Garrington' effect (Laing\n1988; Garrington et al. 1988). Further, the more depolarized lobe has a steeper spectrum\n(the 'Liu-Pooley' effect) and smaller angular distance between the core and the hotspot\n(Laing 1988; Liu & Pooley 1991a,b). Also, an asymmetry exists in the distribution of the\nemission-line gas in radio galaxies, with more emission-line gas lying on that side of the radio\nsource for which the depolarization is stronger (McCarthy & van Breugel 1989).\nMost of the 13 FRII radio galaxies have an arm-length ratio close to unity (Table 5). The\nmisalignment angles are typically less than 8 degrees. Further, the radio core prominence\nin these 13 FRIIs is small, \u22124.3 6 Log Rc 6 \u22122.5 (see Table 4). The small misalignment\nangles and radio core prominence suggest that our 13 FRII galaxies are largely plane-of-sky\nobjects. This is consistent with the absence of bright radio jets in these radio galaxies. This\nmakes them useful for a spectral aging study (Paper II).\n\n5.5.1.

(2004), respectively, while squares and diamonds are galaxies from\nPedelty et al. (1989) and Garrington et al. (1991), respectively.\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\nThe jet-sidedness \u2212 depolarization relation cannot be unambiguously examined for our\n6 FRII radio galaxies with mostly tentative jet detections. As the Laing-Garrington effect\nis suggested to be a consequence of Doppler-beaming, we examined the difference in lobe\ndepolarization with respect to the (statistical) orientation-indicators \u2013 the radio core prominence and the misalignment angle, for the larger combined dataset (Fig. 5). We find that\nthe lobe-to-lobe differences in depolarization are not correlated with either the radio core\nprominence or the misalignment angle. The lack of a correlation is consistent with the picture of these radio galaxies lying close to the plane of the sky. However it must be noted\nthat Garrington et al. (1991) failed to see a correlation between depolarization asymmetry\nratio and core strength, even in quasars. This is probably due to the large scatter in core\nprominence relation and the fact that this test is intrinsically less sensitive than one which\ncompares quantities pertaining to two lobes. The lack of any correlation between the sidedness of faint jets with depolarization in a radio galaxy sample with weak jets has been noted\nby Laing (1993).\n\n5.5.2. The Liu-Pooley effect\nLiu & Pooley (1991a) found evidence for a correlation between the depolarization measure and lobe spectral index. They found that the radio lobe with the flatter spectrum is\nassociated with lower depolarization. Among the 13 sample FRIIs, eleven sources have lobe\ndepolarization measure and spectral index estimates, while only seven have depolarization\nestimates for both the lobes (see Table 5). Six out of these seven sources show lower depolarization in the lobe with the flatter spectral index. We examined the Liu-Pooley correlation\nwith the combined dataset and found that the correlation is significant at the 99.99% significance level (Fig. 6). This is a significant improvement from the original radio galaxy\n(excluding quasars) correlation which was observed at the \u223c 80% significance level (also see\nIshwara-Chandra et al. 2001).\nLiu & Pooley (1991a) have pointed out that the line-of-sight effects which derive from\nthe orientation of the jet do not give a clear explanation for the DP -\u03b1 correlation (see also\nDennett-Thorpe et al. 1997). They concluded that differences in the medium surrounding\nthe two radio lobes influence both the spectrum and the depolarization. A denser medium\naround one radio lobe would result in greater confinement of the lobe, thereby decreasing the\nexpansion losses and possibly increasing the radiative losses, resulting in a steeper spectral\nindex and greater depolarization. McCarthy et al. (1991) have indeed demonstrated that the\nemission-line gas is intrinsically asymmetric in powerful radio sources, and the differences in\nthe density of the surrounding medium is sufficient to explain the observed arm-length ratios\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\n\n1.5\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\nDPN-DPS\n\n\u03b1N - \u03b1S\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n-0.5\n-1.0\n\n-0.5\n-1.0\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\nDPN-DPS\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n-1.5\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n1.5\nN-S length ratio\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\nFig. 6.- (Left) The North-to-South lobe difference in the spectral index versus the depolarization parameter.

We do find the presence of the \"alignment\neffect\" (McCarthy 1993), in 4 of our 13 FRII radio galaxies (see Notes in Appendix A).\nWith the intention of singling out factors that could contribute to the DP \u2212 \u03b1 correlation, we examined the dependence of lobe depolarization and spectral index with (possible)\norientation and environmental indicators. We find that the lobe depolarization difference is\ncorrelated with the North to South arm-length ratio (see Fig. 6), (as found by Pedelty et al.\n1989; Laing 1996), in the sense that the shorter side of the source is more depolarized. This is\nin keeping with the idea of greater confinement around the shorter lobe by the source environment, which leads to greater depolarization (Liu & Pooley 1991b). We also find a tentative\ncorrelation between the difference in the lobe depolarization and the difference in axial ratios\nat a significance level greater than 99.8% (see Fig. 7). No trend is observed between the\ndepolarization and axial ratio taken for each lobe separately. More data are clearly required\nto re-examine these relations. The trend between lobe depolarization difference and the\naxial ratio difference implies that shorter and/or fatter lobes are more depolarized. Again\nthis is consistent with the picture of greater confinement around the lobes by the source\nenvironment, which gives rise to fatter lobes and depolarization.\nWe find that the absolute lobe-to-lobe difference in spectral index does not correlate with\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\n\n1.0\n0.5\nDPN-DPS\n\n\u03b1N - \u03b1S\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n-0.5\n-0.5\n-1.0\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n1.5\nN-S length ratio\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n2\nN-S Axial Ratio\n\n4\n\n6\n\nFig. 7.- (Left) The North-to-South lobe difference in the spectral index versus the North-toSouth arm-length ratio.

However, if relativistic beaming was indeed present in these radio\ngalaxies, one would expect a correlation in the opposite sense. We confirm the significant\ncorrelation of the lobe spectral index difference with the North to South arm-length ratio,\nie., the shorter lobe has the steeper spectral index (Fig. 7).\n\n5.6.\n\nStructural Asymmetries and Trends with Redshifts\n\nAlthough the 13 FRIIs have largely symmetric structures, trends with structural asymmetries emerge when the larger combined dataset is considered (see Gopal-Krishna & Wiita\n2004, for a review on structural asymmetries). We find a correlation between the arm-length\nratio and misalignment angle at the 99.9% significance level for the combined radio galaxy\nsample (Fig. 10) - sources whose lobes are asymmetric in length show greater misalignment\nbetween the two sides. This effect has been previously observed by, for example, Macklin\n(1981) and Kapahi & Saikia (1982). This correlation could suggest that the environmen-\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\n\nTable 8.

(1991), respectively.\ntal asymmetries that give rise to the arm-length ratio could also be contributing to the\nmisalignment angles in these radio galaxies, as also suggested by Macklin (1981).\nThe amount of misalignment also places a limit on the systematic jet axis stability\nand/or the dentist drill effect. If a source has two or more hotspots on one side of the source,\nand these two hotspots plus the core (or these two hotspots and the hotspot on the other side\nof the source) aligned to within some angle, say one degree, then the outflow axis must not\nchange by more than an amount \u03b8 in a time \u03b4t. \u03b8 is the accuracy with which the hotspots and\nthe core line up and \u03b4t is equal to or larger than the separation of the two hotspots on one\nside of the source divided by the speed of light. Thus if the separation of the two hotspots\non one side is 10 kpc, and all of the hotspots line up to better than a degree, the wobble\nof the outflow axis must be less than about 10\u221214 rad s\u22121 . Wobbling could also produce\nsubstructure within the hotspots with a characteristic size that is proportional to the corehotspot separation, and this could impact the overall hotspot size. As the misalignment\nangles are typically less than 10\u25e6 in our 13 FRII radio galaxies, we infer that the wobble of\nthe outflow axis in these sources is less that 10\u221213 rad s\u22121 . This argument is based on the\nrelative positions of the hotspots and the core, and does not account for possible light travel\ntime effects. These effects will be small if the source is close to the plane of the sky.\nThe radio core prominence is plotted with respect to the arm-length ratio and mis-\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\n\n3.5\n25\n\nMisalignment (deg)\n\nArm-length ratio\n\n3.0\n\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n20\n15\n10\n5\n\n1.0\n\n0\n-4\n\n-3\nLog Rc\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n-4\n\n-3\nLog Rc\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\nFig. 9.- (Left) Arm-length ratio versus the radio core prominence parameter.

We observe a weak correlation between core prominence Rc and\nmisalignment angle \u03b6, but none between Rc and arm-length ratio Q (see Table 8). The radio\ncore prominence-misalignment angle (Rc \u2212 \u03b6) correlation has previously been observed by,\nfor example, Kapahi & Saikia (1982) and Hough & Readhead (1989). This correlation could\nbe suggestive of the presence of relativistic beaming effects in the core due to orientation\nin the combined radio galaxy sample. On the other hand, there could be an environmental\ncontribution to both the radio core prominence and misalignment angle. For example, the\ninteraction of the jet as it is launched, with the surrounding nuclear environment could give\nrise to a brighter radio core along with changes in its direction of propagation, resulting in\ngreater misalignment angles.\nWe find an anti-correlation between the arm-length ratios and axial ratios for the radio\ngalaxies. In Fig. 10, we have plotted the axial ratios for each lobe separately, with respect to\nthe arm-length ratio, for the combined radio galaxy dataset. The (anti)-correlation implies\nthat sources which have a fatter lobe on one side, are also the most asymmetric in length.\nThis effect is also clearly visible in the radio maps. If one radio lobe is shorter than the\nother, it could perhaps be due to a difference in the surrounding medium which slows down\nthe expansion and confines one radio lobe preferentially. The overpressured radio plasma\nexpands laterally when the jet meets resistance in the forward direction, thus producing\nfatter lobes. A larger variation in outflow direction can also lead to larger misalignment,\nfatter lobes and smaller axial ratios. The axial ratios and misalignment angles are however\n\n\f\u2013 30 \u2013\n\n12\n25\nMisalignment (deg)\n\n10\n\nAxial Ratio\n\n8\n6\n4\n\n20\n15\n10\n5\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n1.0\n\n1.5\n2.0\nArm-Length Ratio\n\n2.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n2.5\nArm-length ratio\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\nFig. 10.- (Left) Axial ratio for each radio lobe versus the arm-length ratio.

The lack of a correlation does not diminish the importance\nof the variation in outflow direction, because symmetric motions like the precession of the\nentire blackhole-double-jet system, could result in zero misalignment but still increase the\naxial ratios.\nThe anticorrelation between axial ratio and arm-length ratio and the correlation between\ndepolarization and axial ratio (Figure 7) leads to an interesting new result. While it has been\nknown for a long time that the shorter lobe is more depolarized in these radio galaxies, we find\nthat shorter lobe is also the fatter one. This explains the correlation between depolarization\nand axial ratio. In a nutshell, we find that the shorter lobe is fatter, more depolarized and\nhas a steeper spectrum.\nWe do not find any correlation between misalignment angle and redshift, nor between\narm-length ratio and redshift (Fig. 11). Barthel & Miley (1988) had found a tentative\ncorrelation between misalignment angle and redshift but Kapahi & Kulkarni (1990) and\nBest et al. (1995) did not find such a correlation, consistent with our result.\nWe find a correlation between the lobe depolarization DP and redshift (Fig 12). Kronberg et al.\n(1972) and Goodlet & Kaiser (2005) have also found that the lobes of high redshift galaxies are more depolarized that their local counterparts. This would indicate that source\nenvironments vary with redshift, which would be consistent with the increasing alignment\n\n\f\u2013 31 \u2013\n\n3.5\n3.0\n\n20\nArm-length ratio\n\nMisalignment (deg)\n\n25\n\n15\n10\n\n2.0\n1.5\n\n5\n0\n0.0\n\n2.5\n\n1.0\n0.5\n\n1.0\nRedshift\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\nRedshift\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\nFig. 11.- (Left) Misalignment angle and (Right) arm-length ratio versus redshift.

However, Morris & Tabara (1973)\ndiscovered that lobe depolarization showed a stronger dependence on the radio luminosity\nrather than on redshift. Goodlet & Kaiser (2005) have also found that lobe depolarization\ndepends on both radio luminosity and redshift. We do not find a correlation between the\ndepolarization difference between the lobes and redshift (see Table 8). Goodlet & Kaiser\n(2005) have reported the presence of this correlation, contrary to our finding. We note however that our sample-size is twice as large as Goodlet's sample and spans a larger redshift\nrange.\n\n6.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have observed 13 large and powerful FRII radio galaxies with multiple arrays of the\nVery Large Array at the frequencies 330 MHz, 1.4, 5 and 8 GHz. Extended radio bridges are\ndetected in all but two FRII galaxies (3C13 and 3C470). The rotation measures between 1.4\nand 5 GHz are small, comparable to the expected Galactic contribution. The spectral index\nmaps between 1.4 and 5 GHz show a gradual steepening of the radio spectra away from\nthe hotspots with some spectral index variations superimposed, in agreement with previous\n\n\f\u2013 32 \u2013\n\n2.0\n\nDP\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\nRedshift\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\nFig. 12.- Depolarization for each radio lobe versus redshift.

This is also consistent with the\nsmall misalignment angles which are less than 8\u25e6 in all but one source. These characteristics\nmake our sample useful for a spectral aging analysis, which will be presented in paper II.\nWe have supplemented our small sample with similar radio galaxy data gleaned from\nthe literature and examined some well-known radio galaxy correlations.\n1. We confirm that the hotspot size rh is correlated with the core-hotspot distance l\nof the source and follows the relation rh \u221d l0.7 . This is consistent with the hotspot\nmaintaining ram pressure balance as the source propagates through a medium with\ndeclining ambient density. This result is further consistent with a self-similar model of\na jet propagating in a medium where the ambient density \u03c1a falls off with distance from\nsource d as \u03c1a \u221d d\u22120.2 . This could be due to the jets spanning hundreds of kiloparsecs\nin these sources, propagating through a roughly constant medium such as that which\nmight be found in the core of a cluster or proto-cluster of galaxies.\n2. The hotspot spectral index varies with redshift as \u03b1HS \u221d z 0.4 , consistent with previous\nstudies on radio galaxies. A simple redshifting of the curved spectrum along with\n\n\f\u2013 33 \u2013\nan increase in inverse-Compton cooling due to scattering with microwave background\nphotons at larger redshifts, could be responsible for this correlation. Alternatively,\nenhanced synchrotron losses in more powerful hotspots could be producing a spectral\nsteepening at higher luminosity. This correlation could also be a result of a higher\nfraction of radio galaxies being located, as a function of redshift, in environments with\ndensities similar to nearby rich clusters.\n3. The hotspot spectral index is correlated with and flatter than the lobe spectral index,\nconsistent with the assumptions of spectral aging models.\n4. We find that the trend between the lobe depolarization and orientation, i.e., the 'LaingGarrington effect' is weak in these radio galaxies, suggesting that orientation/Doppler\neffects are not strong in them - these galaxies lie largely in the plane of the sky.\n5. The correlation between lobe depolarization and lobe spectral index, i.e., the 'LiuPooley effect', gains in statistical significance - radio lobes with a flatter spectrum\nexhibit lower depolarization.\n6. The lobe depolarization difference is correlated with the North-to-South arm-length\nratio, in the sense that the shorter side of the source is more depolarized. This strongly\nsuggests that lobe depolarization depends significantly on environmental asymmetries\nin radio galaxies. The weak correlation between the lobe depolarization and the axial\nratio difference is consistent with this inference.\n7. In agreement with previous studies, we find that the lobe spectral index and depolarization are correlated with redshift. While the lobe spectral index \u2212 redshift correlation\nfollows from points 2 and 3 above, the lobe depolarization \u2212 redshift correlation could\nsuggest a variation in the source environments. However this effect cannot be differentiated from the dependence of depolarization on radio luminosity.\n8. Based on the small misalignment angles in our 13 FRII radio galaxies, we infer that\nthe wobble of the outflow axis in these sources is less that 10\u221213 rad s\u22121 .\n9. We observe a weak correlation between the radio core prominence and misalignment\nangle but none between core prominence and arm-length ratio. This is consistent with\nboth core prominence and misalignment angle being orientation indicators, and the\narm-length ratio being more sensitive towards asymmetries in the environment. The\nradio core prominence and misalignment can however also be correlated if the inner\njet interacts with the ambient medium, resulting in brighter radio cores and larger\nmisalignment angles.\n\n\f\u2013 34 \u2013\n10. The arm-length ratio seems to be significantly correlated with the misalignment angle\nbetween the two sides of the radio source but anti-correlated with the axial ratio. This\nis again suggestive of environmental asymmetries close to the radio sources. Such\nasymmetries can cause a variation in the outflow direction which can result in larger\nmisalignments. Variation in the jet direction can also result in fatter radio lobes and\nlower axial ratios.\n11. We find that the shorter lobe is fatter, more depolarized and has a steeper spectrum.\nTo summarize, the FRII radio galaxy attributes can be influenced by many factors such\nas their local environment and asymmetries in the gas in the interstellar and intergalactic\nmedium, and relativistic beaming effects. Changes in the outflow direction and variations\nin the beam power with time, may also be playing a role. Radio core prominence and\nmisalignment angles can be used as statistical indicators of orientation while the arm-length\nand axial ratios can serve to highlight environmental asymmetries, in large radio galaxy\nsamples. However the environmental contribution to the orientation-indicators, and the\npresence of variable motion of the outflow axis cannot be ignored.\n\n\f79 17 05\n\n79 17 05\n\n00\n\n00\n\nDECLINATION (J2000)\n\nDECLINATION (J2000)\n\n\u2013 35 \u2013\n\n16 55\n\n50\n\n16 55\n\n50\n\n45\n\n45\n\n40\n\n40\n\n35\n\n35\n\n00 16 36\n\n34\n\n32\n30\nRIGHT ASCENSION (J2000)\n\n28\n\n26\n\n00 16 36\n\n35\n\n34\n\n33\n32\n31\n30\n29\nRIGHT ASCENSION (J2000)\n\n28\n\n27\n\nFig. 13.- Total intensity image of 3C6.1 at (left) 1.66 GHz and (right) 4.86 GHz, at a resolution of 2\u2032\u2032 with fractional polarization vectors superimposed.

The spectral index \u03b15.0\nshows a\ngeneral steepening away from the hotspot and towards the core.\n3C13: The HST observations of this source show the optical galaxy to be extended over\nnearly 4\u2032\u2032 with two tail-like structures to the south and east of the nucleus (McCarthy et al.\n1997). The extended emission in both the nucleus and on the 1\u2032\u2032 scale is aligned with the\nradio axis at a PA of 145\u25e6 . Best et al. (1997, 1998) find that the infrared emission from\nthe host galaxy is also strongly aligned with the radio axis. Our radio image shows clear\nhotspots but no radio core in this high-redshift source (Fig. 15). More sensitive observations\nare required to be able to image the full radio bridge.\n3C34: This source lies in a compact cluster of galaxies (McCarthy et al. 1995). The\nHST observations of McCarthy et al. (1997) find that the central galaxy is diffuse with a\nlow surface brightness. Best et al. (1997) have proposed that the aligned optical emission\nobserved in the HST images of 3C34 is associated with a region of massive star formation,\ninduced by the passage of the radio jet through a galaxy within the surrounding cluster. In\nFig. 18 we see that 3C34 shows twin hotspots on the eastern side. The polarization image\nshows extensive structure and changes in the orientation of the magnetic field. The 5 GHz\ngreyscale image shows a faint jet on both sides of the core with the jet on the western side\nbeing brighter closer to the core.\n3C41: The HST observations of McCarthy et al. (1997); Best et al. (1997) show that\nthe optical galaxy is compact and symmetrical. The K-band image of the galaxy indicates\n\n\f\u2013 85 \u2013\nthat it is misaligned by about 25\u25e6 with the radio axis (Best et al. 1997, 1998). We observe\nextended radio bridge region in this source, but the radio core is observed only in the 8\nGHz image (see Fig. 21). The high resolution image at 8 GHz also shows a complex hotspot\nregion. The radio morphology shows a LW3-type distortion, although the southern lobe\nseems to turn back towards the core close to it. The spectral index map shows a flatter\nspectral index extending through the centre of the northern lobe, perhaps suggesting the\npresence of the radio jet (Fig 57).\n3C44: This galaxy lies in a cluster (Spinrad 1986; McCarthy et al. 1995). The HST\nobservations show that the galaxy is either composed of two components oriented northsouth or, more likely, is bisected by a dust lane running east-west (McCarthy et al. 1997).\nFigure 23 shows that this source exhibits a LW1-type radio morphology. We detect a weak\nradio core at the position, RA=01h,31m,21.6459s, Dec=06\u25e6 ,23\u2032 ,43.1048\u2032\u2032. There is a bright\nradio source on the eastern side about 50\u2032\u2032 from the core in 3C44. The spectral index shows a\ngeneral steepening away from the hotspots (Fig. 58). 3C44 shows a hint of a jet-like structure\nextending towards the southern hotspot in the 5 GHz image (Fig. 69).\n3C54: The HST observations reveal a compact nucleus in this galaxy with an extension\nto the southwest in PA 220\u25e6 (McCarthy et al. 1997). There is a compact object near the\nend of the 2\u2032\u2032 extension from the nucleus. It is unclear if the extension is a bridge, tidal tail,\nor jet. There is another companion object a few arcseconds to the southeast. In Fig.26 we\nsee that this source shows a LW1-type lobe morphology. No radio core is observed. The\nnorthern hotspot shows two components in the 5 GHz image. 3C54 shows a jet-like structure\nextending towards the southern hotspot in the 5 GHz image.\n3C114: The low surface brightness optical galaxy of 3C114 is poorly detected in the\nHST observations (McCarthy et al. 1997). A faint compact nucleus with several clumps\nwithin the central few arcseconds is observed in this source. The radio bridge region and\ncore are clearly detected in our observations (Fig.29). 3C114 shows a jet-like structure\nextending towards the southern hotspot in the 5 GHz image. However, the jet-like feature\nis more prominent on the northern side in the 1.4 GHz image.\n3C142.1: Extended [OII] emission in an elongated east-west structure \u223c 5\u2032\u2032 across has\nbeen observed for 3C142.1 by Hes et al. (1996). The radio source lies close to a PA\u223c 40\u25e6 ,\nnot aligned with the emission-line region. We see clear extended radio lobes in 3C142.1.\n(Fig. 32). The southern lobe shows a nearly constant spectral index across it (Fig. 59).\nThis is an interesting source with a bridge structure that is different from most sources. It\ndoes not show the classic surface brightness decline from the hotspot toward the core, has a\nroughly constant spectral index, and a complex hotspot structure.\n\n\f\u2013 86 \u2013\n3C169.1: McCarthy et al. (1997) have observed two galaxies in this system, both with\nextended structure. The host galaxy of 3C169.1 shows a clear extension to the east with\na number of faint clumps within the central arcsecond. The two components lie along the\nradio axis, and the companion object has an extension pointing towards the radio galaxy.\nIn Fig. 35 we see that the northern hotspot is much fainter than the southern hotspot. The\nnorthern hotspot is not detected in the 8 GHz image.\n3C172: The HST image of 3C712 shows that it lies in a complex system \u2013 four objects\nare detected in the optical image (McCarthy et al. 1997). There are two galaxies lying to the\nsouthwest that appear to be associated with 3C172, and they lie along the axis of the radio\nsource. We find that this source has an interesting radio structure (see Fig. 38). The bridge\nappears to pull away to the west side of the source. The polarization image suggests that\nthe magnetic field has been carried to the side of the radio bridge along with the relativistic\nplasma. However, the 8 GHz image indicates that the two brightest hotspots and the weak\nradio core lie roughly along a line. 3C172 shows a jet-like feature closer to the northern\nhotspot in the 5 GHz image.\n3C441: The HST observations of 3C441 by McCarthy et al. (1997) and Best et al.\n(1997) show that the host galaxy is compact and lies in a cluster. The optical galaxy shows\na slight extension to the northwest, along the radio axis. The HST image shows a diffuse\nobject located 12\u2032\u2032 north and 8\u2032\u2032 west of the core galaxy. We find that this source has a\ncomplex radio morphology, especially in the northern radio lobe and hotspot (Fig. 41). The\nmaps suggest that the jet has shifted position moving from the west to the present position\nindicated by the brightest hotspot. The bridge seems to exhibit a type LW3 lobe morphology.\nThe 5 GHz greyscale image shows a jet-like feature extending towards the northern hotspot.\n3C469.1: The HST observations of McCarthy et al. (1997) find that the host galaxy\nof 3C469.1 shows a double structure at PA 95\u25e6 , not aligned with the radio axis. We detect a\nbright radio core in this source but not sufficient radio bridge emission (Fig. 44). The source\nis at a redshift of z=1.336 and more sensitive observations are needed to observe the full\nbridge region in the source 3C469.1 shows a jet-like feature extending towards the southern\nhotspot in the 5 GHz image.\n3C470: Best et al. (1998) find that the host galaxy of 3C470 is slightly extended in\nboth the optical and the K-band images, with the elongation being highly misaligned (by\n80\u25e6 ) with the radio axis. We find that the radio bridge in 3C470 is partly visible only on\nthe southern side (Fig. 44). This is the highest redshift object in our sample (z=1.653).\nTherefore more sensitive observations are required to observe the full bridge region. We\ndetect a radio core at the position, RA=23h,58m,35.9063s, Dec=44\u25e6 ,04\u2032 ,45.5180\u2032\u2032. 3C470\nshows a slight extension in the radio core towards the southern hotspot in the 5 GHz image.\n\n\f\u2013 87 \u2013\nREFERENCES\nAlexander P., 1987, MNRAS, 225, 27\nAlexander P., Leahy J.
