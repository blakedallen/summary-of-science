These follow\nfrom the exponential ansatz of Bern, Dixon and Smirnov [2] for MHV amplitudes in N = 4 SYM. In\nthis paper we examine the amplitudes dependence on helicities and particle-types of external states.\nWe consider the prefactor of string amplitudes and give arguments suggesting that the prefactor\nat strong coupling should be the same as the Yang-Mills tree-level amplitude for the same process.\nThis implies that scattering amplitudes in N = 4 SYM simplify dramatically in the strong coupling\nlimit. It follows from our proposal that in this limit all (MHV and non-MHV) n-point amplitudes\nare given by the (known) tree-level Yang-Mills result times the helicity-independent (and particletype-independent) universal exponential.\nPACS numbers:\n\nIn Ref. [1] Alday and Maldacena uncovered how the\nAdS/CFT string \u2013 gauge theory duality can be used to\ndetermine all n-point scattering amplitudes in N = 4\nsupersymmetric gauge theory at strong coupling.\nUntil now it was unclear if the AdS/CFT correspondence can address scattering amplitudes in gauge theory\ndirectly. These amplitudes should correspond to scattering of open strings with ends living on N D3 branes.\nHowever in the Maldacena \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 decoupling limit [3]\nthe D3 branes essentially disappear giving rise to the\nAdS5 \u00d7 S 5 geometry which serves as the target space\nfor type IIB theory of (closed) strings. The well-known\nholographic relation [4, 5] relates Green functions of chiral primary composite operators in SYM to interactions\nof type IIB supergravity states in AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 , but does\nnot address the on-shell scattering amplitudes in SYM.\nIn the Alday-Maldacena approach [1], as will be reviewed below, the open strings which correspond to gluons (and their superpartners) end on the infrared D3\nbrane. This infrared brane is placed in the AdS5 space at\na large fixed value ZIR of the radial coordinate, and extends along the four worldvolume directions X \u03bc . The infrared brane plays the role of the infrared cutoff in gauge\ntheory. Scattering amplitudes of massless on-shell states\nare infrared divergent in gauge theory and cannot be defined without an infrared cutoff. Infrared-regularised amplitudes in gauge theory are used at intermediate stages\nto calculate infrared-safe physical observables, such as jet\ncross sections, etc. In [1] scattering amplitudes of open\nstrings in AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 which end on the infrared D3 brane\nare identified with the IR-regularised amplitudes in the\nN = 4 SYM. Taking ZIR \u2192 \u221e removes the IR cutoff\nand renders these amplitude IR divergent.\nAt the leading order in strong coupling, \u03bb \u2192 \u221e, scat-\n\ntering amplitudes An are dominated by a single classical string configuration whose boundary conditions are\ndetermined by the external momenta p1 , . . . , pn as explained in [1]. The colour-ordered planar scattering\namplitudes of n gluons with momenta pi and helicities\nhi = \u00b1 at strong coupling are of the form [1],\n\u221a\n\n\u03bbScl\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03bb\n\n= K e\u2212 2\u03c0 Areacl ,\n(1)\nwhere Scl is the worldsheet action evaluated on the classical solution. It is given by the area of the minimal surface Area(p1 , . . . , pn )cl in AdS5 that ends on the boundary of the string worldsheet, with the prescribed boundary conditions determined by the external momenta pi .\nThe exponent in (1) is universal: every n-point\u221a ampli\u03bb\ntude (for fixed n) contains the same function e\u2212 2\u03c0 Areacl\nof the n external momenta. The prefactor K in (1) is\nnon-universal: it depends on the helicities (and particle\ntypes) of the external states in An as well as on the kinematics. Thus, K distinguishes between specific n-point\namplitudes, and has to be determined for each amplitude in order to, for example, calculate cross sections. In\nthe \u03bb \u2192 \u221e limit the entire\n\u03bb dependence of the ampli\u221a\n\u2212 2\u03c0\u03bb Areacl\ntudes is contained in e\nwhile the prefactor K is\n\u03bb-independent.\nThe authors of [1] have concentrated on the universal exponent in (1). They have computed it explicitly\nfor 4-point amplitudes, and also have studied its infrared\nproperties for general n-point amplitudes. The Areacl is\ninfinite when ZIR \u2192 \u221e in agreement with the fact that\nthe amplitudes are IR divergent. When the IR regulator\nis present, it was shown in [1] (both using the explicit\ncutoff and the dimensional\nreduction schemes) that the\n\u221a\n\u03bb\ninfrared properties of e\u2212 2\u03c0 Areacl are in precise agreement\nAn (p1 , h1 , . . . , pn , hn ) = K ei\n\n\f2\nwith the expected IR behaviour of resummed perturbative amplitudes in gauge theory [2, 6, 7, 8].\nFor 4-point amplitudes the classical string action in\nthe exponent of (1) was computed explicitly in [1] using\ndimensional reduction to D = 4 \u2212 2\u01eb dimensions to order \u01eb12 + 1\u01eb + \u01eb0 . Agreement was found with the strong\ncoupling limit of the previously known gauge theory result for A4 due to Bern, Dixon and Smirnov (BDS) [2].\nThis fact, together with the matching of the IR behaviour\nfor all n-point amplitudes provides a non-trivial test of\nthe AdS/CFT result (1) and, perhaps more importantly,\nexplains from the string theory perspective the exponentiated form of SYM amplitudes. In perturbative gauge\ntheory this exponentiation is a consequence of the up to\nnow mysterious iterative structure of MHV loop amplitudes [9],[2, 10, 11, 12, 13] in planar perturbative N = 4\nSYM.\nThe purpose of this letter is to determine the prefactor K of the n-point amplitudes in (1). As already\nmentioned, K is the factor which distinguishes the amplitudes with different helicities (and particle states) and\nis required for any cross section-type calculation. We will\nargue that for all n-point amplitudes K is given by the\ncorresponding tree-level results, K \u221d Atree\nwhich are ein\nther known or can be easily computed using the tree-level\nMHV rules [14, 15, 16] in perturbative N = 4 SYM. More\n\u2212S0\n, where S0 does not depend on\nprecisely, K = Atree\nn e\n\u03bb and is also independent of the helicities of external\nparticles. In string\u221atheory S0 arises from the subleading corrections to \u03bbScl in the effective action. If the\nBDS conjecture holds for all n-point MHV amplitudes\nin gauge theory, S0 can be easily determined by comparing to those. In any case, if our approach is valid,\nit represents arbitrary (MHV or non-MHV) gauge theory n-point planar amplitude at strong coupling in the\nfactorised form\n\u221a\n\u03bbScl \u2212S0\n\nAn = Antree ei\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere only the first factor on the RHS depends on helicities of external states. This form of the answer is in\nagreement with what was known (or conjectured) previously for MHV amplitudes in N = 4 SYM [2]\nAnMHV = Antree\n\nMHV FnBDS (\u03bb;pi )\n\ne\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nEquation (3) is the exponential ansatz of Bern, Dixon\nand Smirnov, conjectured to hold to all orders at weak\ncoupling and continued to the strong coupling regime.\nThe fact that MHV loop amplitudes are proportional to\nthe tree-level MHV amplitudes is a consequence of N = 4\nsupersymmetry (see e.g. Appendix E of Ref. [17] and can\nbe understood from the fact that Antree MHV is given by\na single term, see Eq. (21) below, which is uniquely fixed\nby the kinematic limits and symmetries of N = 4 SYM.\nIt is known, however, that this factorisation does not\nhold order by order in \u03bb for non-MHV amplitudes, and\n\nFIG. 1: Scattering of four open strings ending on N coincident\nD3-branes. A, B, C, D are the Chan-Paton indices labelling\nthe branes on which strings end. For future reference we\nchoose external states described by open strings with one end\non the N th brane, B = D = N (shown in blue), and the other\nend on the remaining N \u22121 branes, A, C = 1, . . . N \u22121 (shown\nin red).\n\n(3) is not valid beyond the MHV case at fixed values of\n\u03bb. However our result (2) implies that such factorisation\ndoes hold in the strong coupling limit \u03bb \u2192 \u221e.\nOur main goal is to find how string amplitudes depend\non the helicities and types of external states. These states\n\u2013 gluons and their N = 4 superpartners \u2013 are massless\nexcitations of the open string. To proceed we first need\nto locate the worldsheet boundary of the open string and\ndiscuss where the vertex operators describing the external states should be placed.\nThe standard AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 string theory description of\nconformal N = 4 SYM arises from considering a stack of\nN coincident D3-branes in flat ten-dimensional IIB string\ntheory and subsequently taking the large-N near horizon\nlimit [3]. Gluon scattering in gauge theory corresponds to\na scattering of open strings with ends on the D3-branes\nfrom the stack, as shown in Figure 1. External states are\nA\nA\ndescried by the vertex operators V (p)T (a) B , where T (a) B\nare the usual SU (N ) generators which keep track of the\nChan-Paton factors A, B = 1, . . . , N .\nWe will be following the philosophy of [1] where one\nD3-brane is separated from the stack of N \u2212 1 branes\nand placed at Z = ZIR . This gives the Coulomb branch\nin gauge theory such that the states transforming in the\nbifundamental1 of SU (N \u2212 1) \u00d7 U (1) become massive\nand all the remaining states of SU (N ) remain massless.\nThis procedure implements an IR regularisation for the\namplitudes where all the external states are in the bifundamental of SU (N \u22121)\u00d7U (1). In practical computations\nthis prescription was actually not used in [1] (they instead\nadopted a version of dimensional reduction), but for our\n\n1\n\nThat is strings stretched between the N \u2212 1 stack and the single\nbrane at ZIR .\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 2: Scattering of open strings stretched between the separated IR brane and the stack of N \u2212 1 D3-branes.\n\ntask of keeping track of the external states, we have to\nemploy the more geometrical prescription in terms of the\nseparated infrared probe brane.\nIn Figure 2 we show what happens to the amplitude\nin Figure 1 when the IR brane is separated from the\nN \u22121 stack. The external states are those of the stretched\nstrings. We now take the Maldacena near-horizon limit\nof the N \u2212 1 stack of D3-branes. The N \u2212 1 branes\ndissolve and generate the AdS5 \u00d7S 5 geometry with N \u22121\nunits of flux through the S 5 as in the usual case, but\nthe IR brane at ZIR remains and can be viewed as a\nprobe brane. Strings with both ends on the IR brane\nremain open strings, strings with both ends on the N \u2212\n1 stack become IIB closed strings in AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 . Our\nexternal states are strings which were stretched between\nthe IR brane and the N \u2212 1 branes in Figure 2. These\nare replaced by the open\u2013closed string interactions. At\ntree level in the string coupling gst these interactions are\nreflected by bending of the open string worldsheet in the\nclassical AdS5 background. Thus, the string worldsheet\nof open strings previously stretched between the IR brane\nand the N \u2212 1 branes in Figure 2 is now bending into\nthe bulk of the AdS5 as shown in Figure 3. The vertex\noperators describing external states are located on the\nDirichlet IR brane, which is the only brane remaining.\nNormally one expects that the external states, being\nthe states of the boundary conformal SYM theory, should\nlive on on the boundary of the Anti de-Sitter AdS5 space,\nand this is where the boundary of the open string worldsheet must be. In terms of Poincar\u00e9 coordinates (X \u03bc , Z)\nthe AdS5 boundary is spanned by coordinates X \u03bc and\nis placed at the radial coordinate Z \u2192 0. However,\nour earlier discussion shows that the open string worldsheet in the Alday-Maldacena approach ends on the IR\nbrane at large values of Z = ZIR rather than at Z \u2192 0.\nAs explained in [1], possible confusion is avoided when\none recalls that the Z = ZIR \u2192 \u221e surface also touches\n\nFIG. 3: In the Maldacena near-horizon limit the N \u2212 1 stack\ndissolves into the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 geometry and the IR brane is\nthe only brane remaining. The stretched strings worldsheet\nin Figure 2 becomes the open string worldsheet curved into\nthe AdS bulk. We show a slice of this worldsheet at finite\nvalues of X \u03bc . In the asymptotic region X \u03bc \u2192 \u221e the red\ndotted lines approach the IR brane so that all the asymptotic\nscattering states are located on the IR brane.\n\nthe boundary of AdS5 at values of X \u03bc \u2192 \u221e. Thus the\nboundary of AdS5 is not only described by Z \u2192 0, but\nalso by Z = ZIR at large values of X \u03bc .\nThe reason why the correct description of gluon scattering is achieved in terms of open strings ending at\nZ = ZIR and not at Z \u2192 0 is most easily understood\nby comparing two problems: one of gluon scattering in\nSU (N ) gauge theory, and the other of calculation of Wilson loops made by infinitely heavy quarks in the fundamental representation of the SU (N \u2212 1) SYM. Both\nproblems are addressed by considering the worldvolume\nactions of the string stretched between a single D3 brane\nput at a fixed value of Z and the remaining N \u2212 1 D3\nbranes of the SU (N ) gauge theory. The mass of the\nstretched string goes to infinity when Z \u2192 0 (giving an\ninfinitely heavy fundamental quark state of SU (N \u2212 1))\nand this set-up corresponds to the Wilson loop calculation of [20]. The alternative scenario where the single\nbrane is at Z = ZIR gives masses of stretched strings\nof order m = 1/ZIR which correspond to light gluons\n(becoming massless when the IR regulator is removed,\n1/ZIR \u2192 0).\nThus we have established that the asymptotic external\nstates live on the boundary of AdS5 , which (up to a constant rescaling by ZIR ) is the 4-dimensional Minkowski\nspace.2 There we can use the standard flat space definition of vertex operators V . For a gluon state of momen-\n\n2\n\nRecall that the Dirichlet IR brane which defines the string worldsheet boundary, approaches the boundary of AdS5 at asymptoticly large X. Since the IR brane is placed at ZIR , the relevant\nto us component of the AdS5 boundary is also at ZIR . Hence\nthe vertex operators (4) below will also be at ZIR .\n\n\f4\ntum pi and helicity hi = \u00b1 we use\nV (pi ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bc\nd\u03c4 eipi X\u03bc (\u03c4 ) \u03b5\u00b1\n\u03bc (pi )(\u2202\u03c4 X (\u03c4 ) + . . .),\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c4 parameterises the boundary of the worldsheet\n(\u03c4, \u03c3), the polarisation vector of the gluon is \u03b5\u00b1\n\u03bc (pi ) and\nX \u03bc = X \u03bc (\u03c4, \u03c3 = 0) is taken at the boundary (with the\nradial coordinate Z = ZIR ). The ellipses on the right\nhand side indicate the supersymmetric completion of the\nvertex operator. These terms will not modify our conclusion for the prefactor.3\nAs mentioned earlier, the vertex operators (4) must be\naccompanied by the Chan-Paton factors of the external\nA\nstates of the form T (a) B where the choice of our external\nstates requires that one of the labels A, B corresponds\nto the IR brane, and the other runs from 1 to N \u2212 1.\nThe full Chan-Paton factors of the amplitudes in Figures 1, 2 remain unchanged after the Maldacena limit\nis taken and are inherited by the amplitudes in Figure 3\neven though the N \u22121 stack has disappeared. The amplitudes can now be represented in the colour-ordered form\nand we can concentrate on the purely kinematic partial\namplitudes, ignoring the colour SU (N ) structure. Full\namplitudes are obtained from the kinematic partial amplitudes in the standard way (see e.g. [21, 22]) by multiplying them with known colour structures (traces of\nproducts of T (a) 's) and summing over inequivalent permutations. The general philosophy up to now was set up\nto address scattering amplitudes with very specific external states \u2013 those transforming in the bifundamental\nof SU (N \u2212 1) \u00d7 U (1) \u2013 which is a subset of the full set\nof states in the adjoint representation of SU (N ). Then\nfrom the kinematic partial amplitudes arising in this approach one can assemble the full SU (N ) amplitude for\ngeneral SU (N ) external states by simply assuming the\nfull SU (N ) gauge invariance. Moreover, we also expect\nthat the original set-up itself can be extended to address\nmore general non-Abelian amplitudes. To this end one\nwould have to pull out a few (but still a fixed number) of\ndistinct IR branes before taking the large-N near horizon limit. The choice of external states dictates which\nIR branes should be selected for each process. We will\nnot pursue this any further at present.\nThe n-point open string partial amplitude is repre-\n\n3\n\nIt will turn out that the prefactor is determined in our approach\nby a corresponding tree-level open string amplitude in the \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0\nlimit and in the flat background. In this limit the amplitude\nis the same whether it is calculated in the non-supersymmetric\nopen string theory, or in the fully supersymmetrised version reflecting the fact that gauge theory tree-level amplitudes are not\nsensitive to superpartners. (For fixed external states, superpartners can propagate only in loops and are decoupled at tree level.)\n\nsented by the Polyakov's functional integral\nZ\n\u221a\nAn = DX V (p1 ) . . .

However, we will argue that such a solution can be obtained by patching a \u03c4i -independent IRregulated solution of [1] in the bulk to a new \u03c4i -dependent\nsolution which we will construct near the boundary.\nWe start by revisiting the classical string solution of\n[1]. This is an extremum of the exponent in (7) without\nsources, i.e. at J = 0. It is best described in terms of\nfields (y \u03bc , r) dual to (X \u03bc , Z) which are defined via [1]\n\u2202\u03b1 y \u03bc = i\n\n1\n1\n\u01eb\u03b1\u03b2 \u2202\u03b2 X \u03bc , r =\nZ2\nZ\n\n(9)\n\nThe boundary conditions that the original coordinate X \u03bc\ncarries a momentum p\u03bci give the conditions that y \u03bc jumps\nby an amount proportional to the momentum p\u03bci at the\nemission points.

Projection on the (y1p\n, y2 ) plane gives the square with the sides\nof length k = s/2 which by rescaling can be set to 2,\nas shown in Figure 4 (b).\nIdeally for our full action, one would like to instead\nevaluate it in the conformal gauge retaining full dependence on \u03c4i .

However the answer would be\ndominated by the classical action of [1] which is independent of the \u03c4i .\nNow consider the procedure for IR regulation. The\nsolution of [1]\nq\ny0 (y1 , y2 ) = y1 y2 , r(y1 , y2 ) = (1 \u2212 y12 )(1 \u2212 y22 ) (11)\n\ndoes not have an explicit infrared cutoff; instead of\nboundary conditions\nr(\u00b11, y2 ) = r(y1 , \u00b11) = rIR ,\n\n(12)\n\ny0 (\u00b11, y2 ) = \u00b1y2 , y0 (y1 , \u00b11) = \u00b1y2\n\n4\n\nFor example at the insertion point \u03c41 we have y1 = +1 and y2\nchanges from \u22121 to +1, dictated by \u2206y2 (\u03c41 ) = ~k1 = 2.\n\nthe solution (11) satisfies the boundary conditions with\nrIR = 0. In [1] the classical action on the solution (11)\n(and on more general boosted solutions with s 6= t) was\nregulated by dimensional reduction with the IR divergences manifesting themselves as 1/\u03b5 poles. Here however it is more illuminating to introduce an IR cutoff into\n(11) by limiting the range of integrations over y1 and y2\nsuch that on the boundary of the integration region, the\nfunction r is constant rIR 6= 0. This defines the boundary\nin the form\n2\nrIR\n= (1 \u2212 y12 )(1 \u2212 y22 ) , 0 < rIR \u226a 1\n\n(13)\n\nwhich we plot in Figure 5. In terms of the explicit\nIR cutoff rIR = 1/ZIR , the action on the solution\n(11),(13) is equivalent to the double integral performed\ninside the boundary curve (13) (the shaded region in Figure 5.) In other words, by construction, the action in\nthe inner region corresponds to an IR-regulated AldayMaldacena universal exponent, albeit in the ZIR regularisation rather than the dimensional reduction scheme\nused in [1].\nThis regulation (13) clearly excises an important region from the integration, namely the cusps of the square\nwhere IR divergencies occur. However, smoothing the\ncusps has not only removed the IR divergencies, but has\nalso removed from the \u03c4i integrations precisely those regions in which the wavefunctions of the asymptotic states\nare completely separated and indeed they are never fully\nresolved. In other words the smoothing of the square\nhas removed the kinematic poles of the \u03c4i integration.\nIn order to restore them, we propose to patch the solution inside the smooth region by matching it to another\nsolution which has r nearly equal to rIR = 1/ZIR > 0\nand extends all the way to the square boundary. We will\nsee below that this patch is really needed only near the\nboundary (the dotted outer region in Figure 5) and can\nbe constructed essentially in flat space.\nTo restate the argument, we claim that if one were able\nto determine a full solution to the equations of motion in\nthis background, the action would separate into a \"bulk\"\npart described by (an IR-regulated) action of ref.[1], and\na near-boundary contribution which will be constructed\nshortly. This near-boundary contribution (in distinction\nwith the AM action) carries dependence on the insertion points \u03c4i of the vertex operators and is essential for\ndetermining the prefactor. This contribution is manifestly IR-safe (thus can be calculated in a regularisation\nscheme of our choice) and due to its \u03c4i -dependence it is\nclearly distinct from the AM action. Finally, this boundary action is not important for the universal exponent\nof \u221a\n[1] (since it will turn out to be formally subleading in\n1/ \u03bb), but is necessary to determine the prefactor.\nAs already mentioned, the Alday-Maldacena action\ndoes not depend on the emission points \u03c4i and is a homogenous function of external momenta. Specifically its\nIR-finite part depends only on the ratios of momenta and\n\n\f6\nas such it does\u221anot matter whether we keep k fixed or p\nfixed (k = p/ \u03bb) when we eventually send \u03bb to infinity. There are also boundary contributions to the action\ncoming solely from the edges of the square, or more generally from the edges of n-sided polygons, for n-point\namplitudes. Note that in the boundary part of the action it will be important to keep the physical unrescaled\nmomenta p\u03bci fixed when taking the strong coupling limit.\nTo calculate the contributions near the edges we look\n\u03bc\nfor the classical solution Xcl\nnear the worldsheet boundary in the dotted region of Figure 5. There, as explained\nearlier we treat the Z-field as approximately constant\nZ = ZIR .

It is the\nboundary contribution to the action we are after. We\nboundary\ndenote it \u221a1\u03bb Scl\n(\u03c4i , pi ). The total action reads\n\u221a\n\n1 boundary\nbulk\n\u03bbScl\n(pi ) + \u221a Scl\n(\u03c4i , pi ).\n\u03bb\n\n\u221a\nusual log(\u03c4i \u2212 \u03c4j )). We now take the limit of \u03bb \u2192 \u221e\nkeeping the physical momenta p\u03bci and the IR-cutoff ZIR\nfixed. In this limit we pick up the poles contribution of\nthe tree-level Veneziano amplitude in flat space, which is\nprecisely the tree-level Yang-Mills amplitude we are after.\nNote that the contribution to the amplitude coming from\nboundary\n(\u03c4i , pi ) is actually independent of\nour patch \u221a1\u03bb Scl\n2\nZIR . This can be seen by recalling that G = ZIR\nGflat\nand these two powers of ZIR can be removed by rescaling\np \u2192 ZIR p and J \u2192 ZIR J. Since the amplitude An goes\nas p\u2212n , the ZIR -dependence disappears from An . Thus\nwe see that the prefactor is IR-safe as it should be for the\ntree-level amplitude. A posteriori, this justifies our use\nof the IR regularisation scheme by a cut-off ZIR for the\ncalculation of the prefactor.\nWe conclude that the prefactor K in (1) is proportional\nto the tree-level Yang-Mills amplitude. It is important to\nnote that the nature of our strong coupling limit is different from the one taken in [23]. The authors of [23] were\ntaking the combination \u03b1\u2032 pi pj \u2192 \u221e which corresponded\nto their case of interest, namely of taking the very high\nenergy limit of the string amplitude in flat space. In our\ncase this procedure would give us the exponential tail\nof the Veneziano string amplitude, rather than its pole\npart. The correct way to take the limit in the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence\n\u221a case at hand, is to fix physical momenta\nand to send \u03bb \u2192 \u221e (or \u03b1\u2032 pi pj \u2192 0 in the language of\n[23]).\nIt is instructive at this point to compare our patched\nsolution approach in AdS5 to a calculation performed\nentirely in flat space.5 In the latter case, there is no\nradial coordinate (Z or r), the action is free and our\n\"near-boundary\" solution\n(15) is valid everywhere in the\n\u221a\nworldsheet (with \u03bb replaced by 1/\u03b1\u2032 and G being the\nflat space Green function, log(\u03c4i \u2212\u03c4j )). Thus in flat space\nwe don't need the \"bulk\" solution and the full classical\naction is given by (18) i.e. by the second term in (19).\nThe fact that the \"bulk\" action vanishes in flat space\ncan be seen explicitly. We have found the configuration\ny0 (y1 , y2 ) which minimises the Nambu-Goto action, giving SN G = 0, and satisfies the appropriate boundary\nconditions. Hence, in flat space the area (or bulk) contribution to the action is trivial, and the full answer is given\nby (18). This shows an important difference between the\nclassical string actions in the flat case of [23] and the\nAdS case of [1]. In our language, the Alday-Maldacena\nAdS action is the bulk action while the flat-space action\nis purely of the boundary type. In the case considered\n\n(19)\n5\n\nboundary\nThe expression for \u221a1\u03bb Scl\n(\u03c4i , pi ) on the right hand\nside of (18) is precisely the exponent of the generating\nfunctional for the tree-level amplitudes in flat space (we\nrecall that Z = ZIR =const and the Green function is the\n\nWe are of course not implying that the flat space calculation\ndescribes the AdS case. As discussed in detail by Polchinski and\nStrassler [24], the flat space approximation of the AdS is justified\nonly at high energies, when the scattering event takes place in a\nsmall region of space. Moreover, even then, the result of the flat\nspace calculation is folded against AdS wave functions.\n\n\f7\nin [23] the remaining integrations over emission points \u03c4i\nwere performed in the saddle-point approximation relevant to their case of interest, \u03b1\u2032 pi pj \u2192 \u221e. As mentioned\nearlier we work in the opposite limit, \u03b1\u2032 pi pj \u2192 0, where\nthe \u03c4i integrations are dominated by regions \u03c4i \u2192 \u03c4j .\nThis gives the poles part of the Veneziano amplitude\nwhich is precisely the tree-level Yang-Mills amplitude.6\nIn the AdS case the bulk action in non-vanishing (and\nprovides for an overall universal exponent), while the\ntree-level amplitude gives the prefactor of the full amplitude. Since this prefactor arises from the \"pinched\nregions\" where \u03c4i \u2243 \u03c4i+1 , the flat space calculation is\njustified. In other words, in this limit the Green function\nG(\u03c4i \u2212 \u03c4j , \u03c3 = 0) does not enter the AdS5 bulk and stays\non the Minkowski-space boundary.\nWe now briefly comment on the effect of Gaussian fluctuations around the saddle point. A systematic approach\nto integrate out semiclassical fluctuations of strings in\nAdS5 \u00d7 S 5 based on the Green-Schwarz formalism [25]\nwas developed in Refs. [26, 27]. The bosonic part of the\naction contains terms quadratic in\n\u0001 b\nM\n\u03b6 ,\n\u03b4ba \u2202\u03b1 + \u03c9M a b \u2202\u03b1 Xcl\n\n(20)\n\nand other similar terms, as explained in [26, 27]. Here\n\u03b6 a denotes quantum fluctuations around the saddle point\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\nM\nsolution Xcl\n= (Xcl\n, Zcl\n). We note that J and \u03c4i can en\u03bc\nter this action only via Xcl\n(i.e. only in the second term\n\u03bc\n\u22121/2\nJ, as dictated by (15), these\nin (20)). Since X \u223c \u03bb\nJ- and \u03c4i -dependent terms can be neglected in (20). This\nline of argument assumes the validity of our patching approach and that the scaling of the J-dependent part of\n\u03bc\nX is essentially determined by the flat space patch. In\nthis case the overall external-state-dependent structure\nof the prefactor at leading order in \u03bb \u2192 \u221e, is not affected by the fluctuations. One would need to carry out\nthese integrations, however, if one wanted to derive S0\nin string theory. Here we should note that it is not clear\nif the Alday-Maldacena set-up (at least\n\u221a in dimensional\nregularisation) admits a consistent 1/ \u03bb expansion, as\nwas recently pointed out in Ref. [31].\nTo summarise, we have argued that the prefactor K\nof the Alday-Maldacena string amplitude (1) takes essentially the same form as in flat space. Since we are\nignoring cubic and higher powers of fluctuations, and the\nstring worldsheet is a disc, this results in K being proportional to the tree-level planar amplitude and (2) follows.\nAs already mentioned, in gauge theory scattering processes at strong coupling were previously discussed only\nfor the MHV amplitudes, i.e. those with 2 negative and\n\n6\n\nOf course integrations over \u03c4i can be carried out exactly giving\nthe full Veneziano string amplitude. Then the \u03b1\u2032 pi pj \u2192 0 limit\nis the Yang-Mills amplitude.\n\nn \u2212 2 positive helicities. These results follow from the exponentiated ansatz (3) of Bern, Dixon and Smirnov [2],\nwhich was based on a 3-loop calculation of 4-point amplitudes, and was conjectured in [2] to hold to all-orders\nin weakly coupled perturbation theory for n-point MHV\namplitudes. The prefactor in (3) is the tree-level ParkeTaylor MHV amplitude [18, 19] which for n-gluons takes\nthe form\nX\nhpr ps i4\npi )\n(2\u03c0)4 \u03b4 (4) (\nhp1 p2 ihp2 p3 i . . . hpn p1 i\ni\n(21)\nThis amplitude is written in the helicity spinor formalism. Similar expressions hold for all tree-level MHV amplitudes involving gluons, fermions and scalars of N = 4\nSYM. They can be found in e.g. section 5 of Ref. [15].\nFnBDS (\u03bb; pi ) in (3) are functions of kinematical invariants of n external momenta and are computed perturbatively by Taylor expanding in powers of (small) \u03bb. The\nimportant point is that the entire kinematic dependence\nin FnBDS (\u03bb; pi ) is determined from a 1-loop calculation\n(i.e. at order \u03bb1 in weakly coupled SYM perturbation\ntheory). More precisely, we first factor out of the amplitude the IR-divergent part,\n\u22122\nAntree\nMHV = gY M\n\n1\nFnBDS (\u03bb; pi ) = Fndiv ( ; \u03bb; pi ) + Fnfin (\u03b5; \u03bb; pi ),\n\u03b5\n\n(22)\n\nwhere the IR-divergent part contains double and single\npoles in the \u03b5 parameter of the dimensional reduction.\nFndiv is fixed by (and is in agreement with) the general\ntheory of IR divergences in amplitudes [6, 7, 8],[2],[1].\nThe IR-finite part, Fnfin (\u03b5) is determined by the BDS\nansatz [2] for \u03b5 = 0\nFnfin (\u03b5 = 0; \u03bb; pi ) =\n\nf (\u03bb) (1)\nF (pi ) + C(\u03bb).\n4 n\n\n(23)\n\nIf the BDS conjecture is correct, Eq. (23) implies that\nthe kinematic dependence of the amplitude appears only\n(1)\nin Fn (pi ) and is disentangled from the coupling \u03bb de(1)\npendence. The functions Fn (pi ) are determined at the\n1-loop level and are given in Eq. (4.55) of [2]. Functions\nf (\u03bb) and C(\u03bb) depend only on the coupling and are calculated perturbatively [2]. The function f (\u03bb) is the soft\n(cusp) anomalous dimension and is also known\nin the\n\u221a\n2\n\u03bb\nstrong coupling regime [29, 30, 31], f (\u03bb) \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 3 log\n\u03c0 .\nIn order to have an explicit ansatz for all n-point amplitudes\nwe can identify the action of the classical string\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03bb\nArea\nwith the \u03bb terms in the \u03bb \u2192 \u221e limit of the\ncl\n2\u03c0\nBDS exponent for all n-point amplitudes. This identification in principle can (and should) be checked explicitly\nfor general n (and in particular for n \u2265 6) by computing\nappropriate classical string actions and gauge theory amplitudes as well (to check the validity of the BDS ansatz).\nIf it does not hold, then even the MHV amplitudes cannot be matched in string and in gauge theory. This would\n\n\f8\nimply that either the BDS ansatz does not work, or that\nthe proposal of [1] of extending the AdS/CFT correspondence to address gauge theory scattering amplitudes is\nincorrect or at least incomplete. If on the other hand the\nidentification does hold, we have a formula for all n-point\nplanar amplitudes in strongly coupled N = 4 SYM,\nBDS\n\nAn = Antree eFn\n\n(\u03bb\u2192\u221e;pi )\n\n.\n\n(24)\n\nThis would give the prefactor K (at \u03b5 = 0) for a general\n3 log 2 (1)\namplitude (1) in the form, K = Antree e\u2212 4\u03c0 Fn (pi ) up\nto a numerical coefficient coming from eC(\u221e) .\nAfter the earlier version of this paper was published\nit was pointed out in Refs. [32, 33, 34] that there are\nreasons to suspect that the BDS conjecture in gauge theory may fail for MHV amplitudes with n \u2265 6 external\nlegs. The reason for this lies in the \"dual space\" conformal symmetry which uniquely constrains the 4-point\nand 5-point amplitudes to take the BDS form, but not\nthe n \u2265 6 point amplitudes which a priori can differ from\nthe BDS proposal by an arbitrary function of conformal\nratios. Since the BDS proposal was influenced by explicit calculations of only 4-point and 5-point amplitudes\nin [2, 10, 11, 12, 13] it may indeed fail or require modifications at the 6-point level. The main conclusions of\nthis paper are not affected by the validity of the specific\nBDS conjecture.\nThe statement that in the strong coupling limit all amplitudes of N = 4 SYM exhibit an exponential form with\na universal exponential factor in our view is the main\nconclusion of the general approach initiated by Alday\nand Maldacena. The factorised form for these amplitudes (2) is our main result. As mentioned earlier, for\nnon-MHV amplitudes this factorization cannot be seen\nin the weakly coupled perturbation theory. However, the\nremarkable prediction from string theory is that it must\nhold in the strong coupling limit \u03bb \u2192 \u221e where YangMills must simplify dramatically.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Juan Maldacena and Stefan\nTheisen for valuable comments on the first version of this\npaper.\n\n[1] L.
