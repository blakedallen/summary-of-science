Its derivative at contact\nagrees very well with our simulations for D = 2. For jammed states, the expression predicts that\nthe number of exact contacts is equal to 2D, in agreement with established simulations. When\nthe particles are wetted, they interact by the formation and rupture of liquid capillary bridges.\nSince formation and rupture events of capillary bonds are well separated in configuration space, the\ninteraction is hysteretic with a characteristic energy loss Ecb . The pair correlation is strongly affected\nby this capillary interaction depending on the liquid-bond status of neighboring particles. A theory\nis derived for the nonequilibrium probability currents of the capillary interaction which determines\nthe pair correlation function near contact. This finally yields an analytic expression for the equation\nof state, P = P (N/V, T ), of wet granular matter for D = 2, valid in the complete density range\nfrom gas to jamming. Driven wet granular matter exhibits a van-der-Waals-like unstable branch\nat granular temperatures T < Tc corresponding to a first order segregation transition of clusters.\nFor the realistic rupture length of the liquid bridge, scrit = 0.07d, the critical point is located at\nTc = 0.274Ecb . While the critical temperature weakly depends onpthe rupture length, the critical\ndensity \u03c6c is shown to scale with scrit according to scrit = 4d( \u03c6J /\u03c6c \u2212 1). The segregation\ntransition is closely related to the precipitation of granular droplets reported for the free cooling of\none-dimensional wet granular matter [1], and extends the effect to higher dimensional systems. Since\nthe limiting case of sticky bonds, Ecb \u226b T , is of relevance for aggregation in general, simulations\nhave been performed which show very good agreement with the theoretically predicted coordination\nK of capillary bonds as a function of the bond length scrit .

However, the addition of small amounts of liquid are sufficient to transform it into a plastic (or, more\nprecisely, a viscoplastic) material. The same is true for all granular matter when a few volume percent of liquid are\nadded, provided the latter wets the grains well and the grains are not too large. It is understood that this dramatic\nchange, from a quasi-fluid to a solid behavior, is due to the formation of liquid bridges [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]\nbetween the granules wherever they come into contact. These liquid bridges mediate a cohesion force, and rupture as\nsoon as the particle surfaces are separated by a distance scrit which scales as the cube root of the amount of added\nliquid [11]. These processes of formation and rupture of liquid bridges are the main cause of the observed dramatic\nchanges in the mechanical properties of the material. Because of the generality of the effects, it has become common\nto study systems with spherical grains (usually glass beads), in order to ease theoretical modelling and to avoid side\neffects. We decided to follow this approach.\nIn this work we show analytically that the peculiar interaction by capillary bridges gives rise to a first order\ntransition, and we compute the critical density and the critical temperature. We shall focus on the two dimensional\ncase, but many concepts carry over to dimensionality D = 3. Since there is no clear observation of a first order phase\ntransition in the hard-sphere fluid for D \u2264 2 [12, 13], the added liquid leads to a qualitative change. More importantly,\nthis transition is determined entirely by the geometric and energetic properties of the capillary bridges.\nA dry system of N hard spheres with diameter d confined to an area or volume V has no intrinsic energy scale,\nso that the equation of state is of the form P = T f (N/V ) with the temperature T = hmvi vi i and a nonlinear\ndensity dependence, f .

(A) Capillary bridges form at contact and mediate an attractive\nforce Fcb . At the bridge length scrit the bridge becomes unstable and pinches off. (B) This hysteretic interaction by capillary\nbridges gives rise to a well-defined loss of energy denoted by Ecb . The rupture length scrit is largely exaggerated for illustration.\nWhile the particle diameter d is the only length scale for dry granulates, in wet granular matter there is a second scale set by\nscrit . A realistic value is scrit \u2248 0.07d, which is realized when 1% of the jamming volume is added by a wetting liquid (with\nzero contact angle). Furthermore, the bond energy Ecb defines an intrinsic energy scale, which is absent in dry granulates. As\nit is shown, the length and energy scale set by the capillary interaction give rise to a phase transition with a critical density \u03c6c\nand a critical granular temperature Tc .\n\ndimensionless occupied fraction \u03c6 = \u03c3D ndD /(2D D) (\u03c3D the surface of a D-dimensional unit sphere), which is the\narea fraction \u03c6 = \u03c04 nd2 for two, and volume fraction \u03c6 = \u03c06 nd3 for three dimensions.\nThe capillary interaction of wet granular matter has a well-defined binding energy Ecb [10], and it has been\ndemonstrated experimentally [14] under realistic dynamical conditions with impact velocities typical for strongly\nfluidized wet granular matter that the hysteretic character of the interaction is essential: the dominant mechanism\nof dissipation is the hysteretic formation and rupture of capillary bridges, the energy Ecb of which is irreversibly\ntaken from the kinetic energy of the granular motion whenever a liquid\n\u221a bridge ruptures [11]. The bridge energy\nhas been quantified [11, 14], according to which Ecb is proportional d W . Figure 1 illustrates this hysteresis in\nthe Minimal Capillary model [11] applied here, which assumes a constant bridge force Fcb . This may appear as an\noversimplification at first glance, but there is increasing experimental evidence that the details of the force law are\ninsignificant for the collective dynamics on which we focus here [11, 14, 15], as also confirmed from the point of view\nof dynamical systems theory [16, 17].\nObviously, an external energy current has to be continuously injected to drive the system into a nonequilibrium\nsteady state. In the equilibrium limit, Ecb \u2192 0, we will have a pressure of the form P = T f (\u03c6). It is the objective of\nthis article to derive the equation of state for the hysteretic liquid bridge interaction of wet granular matter in such\na driven state. In view of the intrinsic energy scale Ecb , this relation has to be of the form P = P (\u03c6, T /Ecb ).\nThe equation of state is understood as an intrinsic property of homogeneous wet granular matter, kept in a stationary\nnonequilibrium state of granular temperature T . With this given temperature we may subsume various ways in which\nthe system can be externally driven to compensate for the dissipation by rupturing liquid bridges, so that this granular\ntemperature T is maintained over many particle diameters.\nWe remark that in most experimental situations involving wet granular matter, the granular temperature is a\nnonlinear, even discontinuous, response depending on the details of the driving, such as boundary motion or air flow\nin air-fluidized beds. In this article we deliberately regard the granular temperature as the control parameter, so that\nthe theoretical description of the boundary coupling is conveniently separated. Yet we emphasize that for the full\ndescription of an experimental situation one has to insert the equation of state into the equation for the external\nenergy input, and then solve for the granular temperature as the nonlinear response to the external driving.\nWe aim at describing the steady nonequilibrium states of wet granular matter, which are so multifaceted that at first\nglance one might think that aside from density and granular temperature further physical parameters are necessary\nin order to describe such a state. Yet as simulations have shown, states of wet granular matter far from equilibrium\n[1] are very well described by a single granular temperature T assuming a Gaussian velocity distribution, neglecting\nhigher cumulants. Furthermore, it is known that the self-organized velocity distribution of free cooling wet granular\nmatter has a vanishing fourth cumulant [18]. We point out that the condition of a locally isotropic and homogenous\n\n\f3\nstate used in this work implies that the temperature field may vary only slowly over many particle diameters so that\nthere is no strong influence by a heat current, which would otherwise be considered as a third parameter of the local\nnonequilibrium state.\nThroughout this study, we allow for a certain polydispersity, 0 \u2264 \u2206d/d < 0.1. (For higher polydispersity, the dense\nsystem undergoes a kinetic glass transition [19, 20]). First of all, polydispersity is frequently used in simulations\nand experiments to prevent the monocrystalline state. Secondly, most systems of practical relevance exhibit some\npolydispersity. Another characteristic of 'real' granulates is that the surfaces of the grains are not ideal, bearing\ncertain roughness. This does, however, only change the amount of liquid which must be added in order to achieve\nthe capillary interaction: first some liquid is required to fill the crevices and tiny recesses in the grain surfaces, until\nthe grains effectively have a smooth liquid coating, which is then completely wetted by all additional liquid. For glass\nbeads, as those used in most of the experiments, this is typically the case above a volume fraction Wmin = 0.1% of\nliquid with respect to the jammed granular sample volume. We also require an upper limit on the volume fraction of\nthe wetting liquid, so that the maximal length scrit\u221aof liquid bridges is of the order or below the polydispersity \u2206d\nof the spheres. This is to demand that scrit /d \u2248 3 W /3 is smaller than \u2206d/d < 0.1, so that W < Wmax = 2.8%.\nThis happens to closely coincide with the upper limit set on the liquid content to ensure that neighboring capillary\nbridge do not merge [21]. For this range of the liquid content the capillary interaction is a truly pairwise interaction\nwith the capillary force acting radially between pairs of particles. Another implication of roughness is that there is a\nsubstantial tangential friction between adjacent grains. This means that in principle one has to include all rotational\ndegrees of freedom in the kinetic considerations for any statistical physical treatment of our system. However, we are\nhere focussing on the effects due to the liquid capillary bridges, which mediate central forces. These do not couple\nto the (tangential) rotational modes. We therefore expect that the rotational degrees of freedom play, in our system,\nthe role of a spectator heat bath which follows the translational dynamics, but does not influence it greatly, aside\nfrom a quantitative increase of the granular specific heat. In fact, recent experiments and simulations of wet granular\nsystems [15] show that this approach yields remarkable agreement with experimental data. In this work, we thus\ncompletely neglect all rotational degrees of freedom.\nII.\n\nDRY SPHERES AS STARTING POINT\n\nBefore we add the wetting liquid to the hard sphere system, we investigate the dry case in this section and derive\nexpressions for the pair correlation near contact, which will be extended to the wet case in the following section.\nDue to their finite size, the positions of hard spheres are not distributed independently from each other, as it is\nthe case for the point-particles of the ideal gas. The configuration space of N spheres is not V N , but restricted to a\nconcave subset in which the systems moves chaotically as a high dimensional billiard. With the absence of an intrinsic\nenergy scale, the dry system is athermal, which means that a change in temperature is equivalent to rescaling the\ntime axis. The excluded volume gives rise to correlations in the particle positions, which are measured by the pair\nPN\ncorrelation function. Denoting by n = N/V the mean macroscopic particle density and by nm (r) = i \u03b4(r \u2212 ri ) the\nmicroscopic density, the isotropic pair correlation G(r) is defined as the probability\nhnm (r)iparticle at 0 d vol = n G(|r|) d vol = n g(s) d vol\n\n(1)\n\nto find the center of a particle in the shell d vol = \u03c3D r(D\u22121) dr of radius r = ri + rj + s and thickness dr = ds centered\naround a reference particle. We have conveniently subtracted the particle radii ri + rj in the last equality of (1), so\nthat s > 0 is the surface separation. The function g(s) is advantageous for polydispersity scattered around the mean\ndiameter d [63], because of its defined contact point, s = 0, which is smeared out in the function G(r). Furthermore it\nis the natural way to describe an interstitial liquid bridge between the considered pair of particles, with s the length\nof the bridge. For a certain liquid volume per particle and contact angle of the wetting liquid, there is a well defined\ncritical bridge length scrit at which the bridge becomes unstable and ruptures. The mean density n is factored out in\n(1) so that the dimensionless g would be equal to unity for all separations if there was no particle-particle correlation.\nFigure 2 shows the pair correlation of a fluidized state in which long range order is lost, so that g(s), respectively\nG(r), tends to unity for r \u226b d.\nThe forces in wet granular matter, hard-core repulsion and liquid bridge attraction, are short-ranged and radial,\nacting between pairs of particles over a separation range 0 < s < scrit with scrit \u226a d. We are therefore interested in\nthe short-range behavior of the pair correlation g(s) up to leading order in s/d. For such short particle separations\nthe pair correlation g(s) is (up to a normalization constant) just the probability P\nto find next neighbors at a separation\n\u221e\ns. Put in equivalent words: decomposing the pair correlation function g(s) = k=1 gk (s) in contributions gk of the\nk's shell of Vorono\u0131\u0308 neighbors, we have g(s) = g1 (s) in the range of interest, 0 < s < scrit \u226a d. To shorten notation\nwe suppress the subindex 1.\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 2: The pair correlation of wet granular matter in a fluidized state resulting from a molecular dynamics-type simulation\nin D = 2 dimensions. The correlation function G(r) vanishes in the range (0, d) where the finite particle size leads to excluded\nvolume. We use the function g(s) with the surface separation s of neighboring particles as it is convenient for wet granular\nmatter where interstitial liquid bridges have the length s. Note that this is not exactly identical to the function G(d + s) shifted\nby one particle diameter d, since a realistic granular system has some polydispersity \u2206d around the mean diameter d. Aside\nfrom kinetic contributions, the pressure is due to the interaction forces which become dominant with increasing density. The\ninternal forces in wet granular matter are short-ranged. Therefore our interest focuses on the sharp fall-off in the indicated\nrange 0 < s < scrit of capillary interaction. This highlighted region indicates the typical range of scrit , and corresponds to the\nregion highlighted in Fig. 4. Furthermore, we derive more detailed correlation functions, g u (s) and g b (s), for unbound and\ncapillary connected pairs, respectively, in order to describe the hysteretic interaction in wet granular matter.\n\nA.\n\nThe Dense Limit\n\nFigure 3 gives an overview of results by [20], [22] (Fig. 15 therein), and [23] for the phases of the two-dimensional\nsystem depending on density and polydispersity. For polydispersity below 0.1, there are two density regimes separated\nby the ordering transition at \u03c6o [64]. These transitions are a purely geometric property (i.e. excluded volume effect)\nof the configuration space and are therefore athermal. To compute the radial next-neighbor distribution at densities\nabove the critical density, \u03c6 > \u03c6o , we consider the Vorono\u0131\u0308 tessellation of the system, which embeds each particle into\na convex polygonal cell. The sizes {Vi } of these Vorono\u0131\u0308 cells scales as (d + s)D , with the particle separation s. The\nPN\nmean cell size i Vi /N = V /N = 1/n is exactly the inverse density n.

The athermal transitions shown are properties of the configuration\nspace of hard discs. Since the wet granular dynamics takes place in this configuration space, results for hard discs form the\nstarting point for a theory of wet granular matter in two dimensions. At low (gas) and moderate (fluid) densities \u03c6, the\nconfiguration space is probed ergodically and the system has low shear viscosity. As density is increased, the system gets\ntrapped in a disordered state (glass for polydispersity above 0.1), or in a state with local triangular order. Both transitions, the\nglass transition (vertical line at \u03c6 \u2248 0.80) and the ordering transition (curved line ending at \u03c6o = 0.71) can be detected by the\nrapid increase of the shear viscosity \u03b7 (cf. [24] for the ordering transition). While there is an athermal first order transition in\nthree dimensions, it is at present discussed in the literature whether the transition region (double lines ending at \u03c6o ) represents\na fluid/solid coexistence (corresponding to a weak first order transition with a small jump of the entropy per particle) or if\nthere is an intermediate hexatic phase (according to the Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young scenario) [12, 13]. As the\npacking fraction \u03c6 is increased further, the islands to which the system is confined in the configuration space shrink to points.\nThis jamming limit can be detected by the divergence of the pressure p (at fixed granular temperature) under compression (for\nexample using the particle expansion of the Lubachevsky-Stillinger algorithm). The maximal random jammed state (MRJ, for\nstrict jamming as defined by Torquato, Truskett, and Debenedetti [25]) is the vertical curve at the right. Densities higher than\nMRJ are deep in the glassy regime. From the thermodynamic point of view, the system would cluster in phases separated\naccording to the particle size, but this eutectic freezing-transition is kinetically suppressed [22] and unreachable.\n\n[26].

Expression (9) is exact for D = 1, and has been confirmed as the asymptotic behavior of the\ndiverging pressure close to jamming for D = 2 [24, 29] in event-driven simulation with accuracy 10\u22124 . We remark\nthat this expression is not limited to weak polydispersity and has been confirmed for polydispersity far above 0.1 in\nthe glass state [30, 31].\nInserting (9) in (6), we have as our first central result a closed expression for the near-contact pair correlation of\nneighbors which form exact contacts in the jamming limit (so-called A-neighbors):\n\u0012 D\u22121\n\u0015\u0013\n\u0014\u0010\n2\ns \u0011D\ngA (s) = gcat exp \u2212\n\u22121\n.\n(10)\n\u03c6 gcat\n1+\nD\nd\nEq.

(11) can be viewed as a consequence of normalization:\nthe height of the contact peak is gcat and so the width is of the order 1/gcat, which means that the negative slope is\nof the order gc2 . In fact, writing the A-neighbor correlation function gA (s) in terms of the contact value gcat , as we\ndid in (10), is the natural form to express the density dependence of gA because this manifests that the coordination\nnumber of A-neighbors is density independent:\nZ\nKA = n gA d vol\n\u0014\u0010\n\u0015\u0013 \u0010\n\u0012 D\u22121\nZ \u221e\ns \u0011D\ns \u0011D\u22121\n2\n2D D\n1+\n\u22121\n1+\nds\n\u03c6 gcat\n\u03c6 gcat\nexp \u2212\n=\nd\nD\nd\nd\ns=0\n= 2D .\n(12)\nMore significantly, KA equals exactly the isostatic contact value 2D, which is obviously correct for particles on a line\n(D = 1) and is the accepted value for ideal discs and spheres in D = 2 and D = 3 dimensions respectively [22, 32, 33].\nThe finding (12) is an essential confirmation of consistency of our approach, since it is independent from conventional\narguments based on the rank of the rigidity matrix (which accounts for global constraints on the degrees of freedom)\n[32].\nAs the contact value gcat (9) grows to infinity in the jamming limit, \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6J , the constant integral (12) implies that\nn gA (s) becomes a delta distribution with 'weight' 2D at contact, s = 0.\n2.\n\nThe Background Contribution: The B-Neighbors\n\nThe configuration space is spanned by all particle positions {ri }. Consequently, a jammed configuration is \u2013 aside\nfrom a small fraction of rattlers [65] \u2013 an isolated configuration point, and the set of jammed configuration is a set of\ndiscrete points. When the density is slightly relaxed, a finite system remains confined to a finite environment around\nthe jamming point (cf. [34], p. 35). As density is lowered further, these environments are no longer isolated so that\nthe system is able to migrate between theses 'islands of jamming'.\nThe stability analysis of contact networks [32, 35, 36, 37, 38] has put forth the result that frictionless spheres\n(except for the singular limiting case of a monodisperse crystal) jam strictly in an isostatic packing with 2D contacts\nper particle on average, as confirmed numerically [32] for D = 3, be the state random (glass regime in Fig. 3) or\nlocally ordered. Therefore we can identify within an island of jamming on average four neighboring particles in D = 2\ndimensions which are close to the reference particle, and which will be in contact with the reference particle, sA \u2192 0,\nin the jamming limit, \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6J . These are the A-neighbors with the contribution gA to the pair correlation derived\nin (10). Furthermore, it is a mathematical fact that any discrete set of points in flat two-dimensional space has on\naverage six Delaunay/Vorono\u0131\u0308 neighbors [39], two of which have no contact to the reference particle, gB (0) = 0. Hence,\non the mean field level the following picture arises: Beside the four A-neighbors there are two B-neighbors which are\nsterically hindered by other particles from further approach to the reference particle.

Close to jamming we distinguish between\nneighbors which form exact contacts in the jamming limit (contribution gA , Eq. (10)) and those that are blocked at positive\nseparation s (curve gB , Eq. (14)). The near-contact correlation is the sum of both contributions. For this plot the density is\nchosen to \u03c6 = 0.8.

They are out\nof the interaction range, 0 < s < scrit , which is indicated by the highlighted stripe.\n\ngives us the pair correlation function near contact. The pair correlation near contact which arises from these blocked\nstates, gB , is discussed in detail in appendix A. The essential result is that the configuration space of blocked states\ntends quadratically to zero in sB , so that to leading order the normalization of two B-neighbors for D = 2 determines\nthe B-contribution in (13):\ngB (sB ) = N PB (sB )\ni\nh\n\u0010 s \u0011i\n1 \u0010 sB \u00112 \u2212 (1+ ds )2 \u22121 /cB h\nB\n1+O\n=\ne\n3\n\u03c6cB\nd\nd\n\n(14)\n\nwith cB = \u03c6max /\u03c6 \u2212 1.

When two spheres are closer than one diameter,\ns < d, they shield each other from certain collisions events. If one was to neglect three-particle correlations, the\nisotropic bombardment by 'third' particles gives rise to the well-known attractive depletion force first proposed by\nS. Asakura and F. Oosawa [40, 41]. As is evident from Fig. 5, summing up equal contributions over the accessible\ncross section is equivalent to the pressure exerted onto the submanifold indicated by the solid line in Fig. 5C and\ndenoted by \u03a3.\nThis depletion force, as well as the liquid bridge force which we will take into account in the next section, will\naffect the pair correlation function. A systematic way to study this effect has been worked out by Hansen et al. [42],\nresulting in a Fokker-Planck equation for the two-particle distribution function. After integrating out the momenta\nand the center of mass coordinates, one finds that the depletion force as well as other non-entropic pair forces (such\nas the liquid bridge force), give rise to a Boltzmann factor,\n\u0013\n\u0012\nV (s)\n.\n(15)\ng(s) \u221d exp \u2212\nT\nFor the depletion force\n\u2032\nFdepl = \u2212Vdepl\n= T n gcat \u03a3 ,\n\n(16)\n\n\f8\n\nFIG. 5: Origin of the depletion force attracting neighboring particles that are separated by less than a particle diameter. One\nmay either think of this as an entropic force, due to the decrease of excluded volume when the shells of excluded volume\noverlap. Equivalently one may view this as the net force due to isotropic bombardment. Obviously, the integration over the\nsolid arc in A is up to a sign equivalent to the integration in plot B. In B the integration is over the outer solid arc, which is the\nconfiguration space of the third particle's coordinate at impact. Since the integration in B is projected by a cos-factor to give\nthe axial symmetric force component, we can equivalently drop the cos-factor and integrate over the submanifold indicated by\nthe solid line \u03a3 in C.\n\nwhere\nn gcat \u03a3 ds =\n\ndVconf\n= \u2212d ln g(s)\nVconf\n\n(17)\n\nis the infinitesimal logarithmic change of the excluded area (or the configuration space per particle, Vconf ), when the\nparticles are separated by s < d, and \u03a3 denotes the size of the corresponding section (line or area) in Fig. 5C.

Polydispersity is known to have a minor effect on the\ndepletion attraction [44]. For D = 1 (17) gives the Poisson distribution Vdepl /T = \u03c6 gcat s/d which is exact only for\nD = 1.\nIn two dimensions, the depletion potential is\n\u0010\n\u0011\nVdepl\n\u03b3vol\n2\n=\n\u03c6 gcat 4 arctan\n+ \u03b3vol W \u2212 C\n(20)\nT\n\u03c0\nW\n\u0011\n\u0010\ns 2\n\u03c6 s\n(21)\n+O\n= 2gcat\n\u03c6max d\nd\np\n\u221a\nfor D = 2 with \u03b3vol (s) = 1 + s/d, the square root W (s) = (1 \u2212 s/d)(3 + s/d) and the constant C = 2\u03c0/3 + 3 to\nhave Vdepl = 0 at s = 0. The first line (20) is valid for 0 \u2264 s \u2264 d, and the second line (21) suffices for the region of\ninterest, 0 \u2264 s \u2264 scrit \u226a d. For the application of results on the near-contact decay of the pair correlation function,\nsuch as (21), we prefer the exponential notation (used before in the dense case (10)) because it is most elegant to\nperform volume integration:\n\u0012\n\u0015\u0013 \u0014\n\u0014\u0010\n\u0010 s \u00112 \u0015\n\u03c6\ns \u00112\nB\ndilute\nat\nat\ngAO (s) = gc exp \u2212\n\u22121\n1+O\ng\n1+\n(22)\n\u03c6max c\nd\nd\nfor D = 2. In this notation the dilute and dense behavior of the pair correlation are conveniently compared, showing\nthat the result (22) for the gaseous/fluid regime differs by the factor 1/\u03c6max = 1.10 in the exponent from the dense\nresult (10) close to jamming, so that according to (22) the depletion force falls-off slower than the configuration density\n\u03c6gcat . We will now show that this is due to an over-estimation of the depletion force, caused by neglecting correlated\nthree-particle events: when the plane of incidence of the third particle closely coincides with the symmetry plane \u03a3,\n\n\f9\nthe incoming particle will hit in short sequence the pair of particles considered, which increases very effectively the\nexchange of momentum, i.e. the depletion attraction is reduced.\nTo determine analytically and numerically the effect of correlated collisions which correct the Asakura-Oosawa\nresult (22) we define the dimensionless measure\nZ=\n\n4 Fdepl\ndg \u2032\n= \u2212 c2 ,\nat\n\u03c0 nT dgc\n\u03c6 gc\n\n(23)\n\n\u221a\nfor which the Asakura-Oosawa approach (16) and (18) gives ZAO = \u03c04 3 \u2248 2.205 (Line A in Fig. 7). When we take\ncorrelated three-particle events into account, there are three contribution. Firstly, an attractive contribution Z1 > 0\ndue to collisions on the front side of the pair, indicated by '1' in Fig. 6, which fall in the range \u2212\u03c0/2 < \u03c6 < \u03c0/2. The\ncorresponding value Z1 is easily integrated. Isotropy of the state demands that the angle \u03b1 between the symmetry\naxis of the pair P \u2032 P and the incoming momentum pi is uniformly distributed, as well as the impact parameter b (cf.\nFig. 6). These collision parameters are related by (\u03b1, b) = (\u03c6 + \u03b8, d sin \u03b8) to the position \u03c6 on P and the angle of\nincidence \u03b8 with respect to the normal of P, which implies that \u03c6 is uniformly distributed and \u03b8 is weighted by the\ncosine-factor cos \u03b8. Integration over \u2212\u03c0/2 < \u03c6 < \u03c0/2 yields the axial force contribution\nF1 = 2T ngcat d ,\n\n(24)\n\nso that Z1 = 8/\u03c0 \u2248 2.546.\nSecondly, the attraction is weakened by collisions hitting P in the remaining range \u03c0/2 < |\u03c6| < \u03c6max (s) (which we\nrefer to as the 'broad side') giving rise to Z2 < 0. At contact \u03c6max (s = 0) is 2\u03c0/3. For these collisions the incidence\nis shadowed by the partner particle P' so that the angle of incidence \u03b8 is restricted to \u2212\u03c0/2 < \u03b8 < \u03b8max (\u03c6). (Confer\nthe collision event '2' in Fig. 6.) Some trigonometry determines \u03b8max (s, \u03c6) by the relation\n(1 + \u03b3vol (s) cos \u03c6) sin \u03b8max = 1 \u2212 \u03b3vol (s) cos \u03b8max sin \u03c6 ,\n\n(25)\n\nwhich allows for an explicit function of \u03c6 at s = 0:\n2 cos \u03b8max (\u03c6) = tan\n\n\u03c6 p\n\u2212 1 + 2 cos \u03c6 .\n2\n\n(26)\n\nAfter integrating over the impact momenta pi in the rest frame of P, the axial force imposed on P is\nZ \u03c6max (s)\nZ \u03b8max (\u03c6)\n4\nat\nd\u03c6 cos \u03c6\nd\u03b8 cos2 \u03b8 ,\nF2 (s) = T ngc d\n\u03c0\n\u03c0/2\n\u2212\u03c0/2\n\n(27)\n\nwhere the cos \u03c6 projects the force on the symmetry axis of the pair PP'. The cos \u03b8 factor appears quadratically in the\nintegrand (27) because of the cosine-distribution (or equivalent, because the Enskog collision frequency is proportional\nto the radial velocity (pi /m) cos \u03b8), and the transferred momentum which is pi cos \u03b8. Symmetry allows us to integrate\nover the upper half, \u03c0/2 < \u03c6 < \u03c6max (s) in (27) and multiply by 2 with the general result\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n8 \u03c6max(s)\n1 \u03b8max (s, \u03c6) sin 2\u03b8max (s, \u03c6)\nZ2 (s) =\n,\n(28)\nd\u03c6 cos \u03c6\n+\n+\n\u03c0 \u03c0/2\n2\n\u03c0\n2\u03c0\nand the numerical value Z2 (0) = \u22120.32813(9).\nThirdly, the most obvious and important correction on the three-particle level comes from double collisions denoted\nby 3 in Fig. 6. The third particle hits first P' (gray arrow in Fig. 6) from the broad side at \u03c6\u2032 \u2208 (\u03c0/2, \u03b8max ). The\nradial component pi cos \u03b8\u2032 of its incoming momentum pi is transferred to P', which is why the third particle moves on\ntangentially to the circular cross section of P' with momentum pi sin \u03b8\u2032 to collide shortly afterwards with particle P.\nHere the momentum transferred is the radial component with respect to P, pi sin \u03b8\u2032 cos \u03b8, so that\nF3 (s) =\n\n4\nT ngcatd\n\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u03c6max (s)\n\n\u03c0/2\n\nd\u03c6\u2032 cos \u03c6(\u03c6\u2032 ) cos \u03b8(s, \u03c6\u2032 )\n\nZ\n\n\u03b8max (s,\u03c6\u2032 )\n\nd\u03b8\u2032 cos \u03b8\u2032 sin \u03b8\u2032 .\n\n(29)\n\n0\n\nThe collision point on P' described by \u03c6\u2032 (\u03c6) is related to \u03c6 (the subsequent collision point on P) by cos(\u03c6\u2032 \u2212 \u03c6) =\n1 + \u03b3vol (s) cos \u03c6.

Satisfactorily, this result (32) has exactly the same functional dependence on the configuration density\n\u03c6 gcat as the formula put forward for the dense case (10) in the previous subsection. While three-particle collisions are\nobviously important since they shift Z in the right direction, no analytic explanation for this coincidence corresponding\nto the value Z = 2 is provided at present. Yet we shall see in the next section that any value other than Z = 2 would\nlead to inconsistencies when we introduce the liquid bridge interaction.\nWe finally remark that the result (32) strongly differs from the 'Poissonian fluid' [45], for which the contact\ncorrelation gcat \u2212 1 > 0 is ignored. Even at the lowest density (\u03c6 = 0.1) considered in Fig. 7 the Poisson fluid would\ngive ZPoisson (\u03c6 = 0.1) = 1.7 which is 15% below the simulation value, and the deviation from Z = 2 grows with\ndensity \u03c6.\nIII.\n\nTHE PAIR CORRELATION UNDER THE HYSTERETIC INTERACTION\n\nIn this section we dress up the pair correlation function in order to describe the status of the liquid-bonds which\nare created and ruptured hysteretically in wet granular matter. We will proceed in two steps: first, we introduce in\npart III A the liquid bridges as hysteretic but forceless objects which follow the unperturbed particle dynamics. As a\nresult, a direct relation of the dynamical system and the limiting case of isostatic granular packings [33, 38] at rest is\nfound. In III B we turn on the liquid bridge force to its physical value, so that the bridges unfold their back-reaction\non the granular dynamics. In the limit of low granular temperatures, T \u226a Ecb , the particles stick together. For this\nfrozen state of wet granular matter the bridge coordination K is computed analytically as a function of the rupture\nlength scrit , and we find very good agreement with simulations.\n\n\f11\n\nA\nB\nC\n\nA: Asakura-Oosawa\nB: 3-Particle Collision Events\nC: Dense Functional Form\n\nFIG. 7: Functional test of the near-contact pair correlation (32). The vertical axis is proportional to the depletion force,\nFdepl \u221d \u2212d ln g/ds at contact, divided by the configuration density \u03c6 gcat . This fraction Z is predicted to be density independent\nby (32) and to assume the value Z = 2 (line C). Line A corresponds to the classical Asakura-Oosawa result, which is only\nvalid for large beads immersed in a bath of small beads. In line B the corrections due to temporally correlated collisions events\n(derived in the text) have been taken into account. These events occur when a third particle of equal size strikes a pair of\nparticles with a given separation s \u226a d as sketched in Fig. 6. We proceed using the value Z = 2 (line C) because it agrees best\nwith the simulation. Furthermore, Z = 2 corresponds to a near contact correlation function which is of exactly the same form\nas the function gA we use in the dense case, when expressed in terms of the configuration density \u03c6 gcat (\u03c6).\n\nA.\n\nThe Hysteretic Coupling\n\nDue to the hysteretic interaction, the pair correlation g is no longer a function of the particle separation s. In\norder to include the knowledge about the collision history the configuration space has to be enlarged in two respects:\nObviously we distinguish between pairs with and without liquid bridges, which we denote by superscript indices, g b (s)\nand g u (s) respectively, for 'bridged' and 'unbridged' neighbors (cf. Fig. 8). In addition, time reversal-symmetry is\nbroken by the formation of the capillary bridge at contact. Hence we distinguish approaching pairs (with a negative\nrelative velocity) which might collide and form a liquid bridge in the future, and those that move apart so that they\ncan rupture the liquid-bond in the future. This relative velocity is denoted by a subscript arrow.\nAs we discuss the radial pair distribution, contact and rupture become the important points on the s-axis of the\npair correlation function. At theses points the functions g b and g u are coupled according to the hysteretic transition\nof the bond status. We use an intuitive notation to refer to these points:\n(\nThe probability for a pair\nu\ngc\u2190 r = at rupture distance\napproaching without bridge.\n(\nThe probability for a pair\ng bc \u2192r = at contact\nmoving away with bridge.\netc.\nThe contact point s = 0 (or to be more precise: the right-sided limit s = 0+) is denoted by a circled c , and the\nrupture at s = scrit by the circled r . Infinitesimally close to contact, there are four detailed correlation values: the\nbridge-connected and the unconnected states, either particularized by the sign of the relative velocity. The same is\ntrue for the left-sided limit s = scrit \u2212 of the rupture point. An infinitesimal distance beyond this point, at s = scrit +,\nthere is only the unbound state possible with the two signs for incoming and outgoing velocities. This gives us in\ntotal ten detailed pair correlation coefficients. These are determined by the following ten equations describing the\n\n\f12\nhysteretic flow of probability, as it we can be read off from Fig. 8:\ng uc \u2192r\ng bc \u2192r\n\nConditions on the contact shell\n= 0\n=\n\ng uc \u2190r\n\n+\n\ng bc \u2190r\n\n(33)\n(34)\n\nThe Eq. (33) expresses that no particles rebound without a liquid-bond, but rather that all return with a bridge as\nstated by (34). This implies that the particle number is conserved in collisions (in contrast to the absorbent dynamics\nmodelled in [18] for D = 1).\nDomain of capillary interaction\ng br = \u03b3 b (scrit ) g bc\ng ur = \u03b3 u (scrit ) g uc\nu\nu\ngc\u2192 r = \u03b3pass gc\u2190\nr\n\n(35)\n(36)\n(37)\n\nThe functions \u03b3 u (s) and \u03b3 b (s) take into account the near-contact decay of the pair correlation without and with liquid\nbond, respectively. The last Eq. (37) describes spectator grains, i.e. grains which pass through the domain of possible\ncapillary interaction without bridge formation. The fraction of these passing particles, \u03b3pass = 1 \u2212 (1 + scrit /d)1\u2212D\n(= 1/(1 + d/scrit ) for D = 2) equals the gap between the considered cross section (2d + 2scrit )D\u22121 of the capillary\ninteraction and the hard-core cross section (2d)D .\n\nb\ngc\u2192\nr +\n\nb\ngc\u2190\nr\nu\ngc\u2190\nr\nu\ngc\u2192\nr\n\nConditions on the rupture shell\n= 0\n= gcu r \u2190\n\n(38)\n(39)\n\n= gcu r \u2192\n\n(40)\n\nThe Eqs. (38, 39) state that only unbound particles enter the domain of capillary interaction, and (40) describes the\nrupture of a capillary bridge when the pair escapes from the domain.\nThe hysteretic capillary dynamics is coupled to the hard particle dynamics by the source term of new unbound\npairs of particles entering the capillary interaction range:\nSource Term\nu\nu\ng uc \u2190r + gc\u2190\n/\u03b3\n(s\n)\n=\n(1\n\u2212 K/Ksites )g at\ncrit\nr\nc\n\n(41)\n\nThe left-hand side is the current of approaching unbound neighbors (measured at contact). If all neighbors were\nunconnected, K = 0, this current would equal the dry value g at\nc . But since there are K neighbors with bonds out\nof the Ksites 'docking sites' which are sterically accessible for liquid bonds, the remaining unconnected fraction is\n1 \u2212 K/Ksites .\nThe final tenth equation is the stationary state condition, which demands that the rupture frequency equals the\nbinding frequency:\n\nfbind\n\nStationary state condition\n= frupt .\n\n(42)\n\nThese frequencies follow from the probability to have a particle on the collision or rupture shell, respectively, multiplied by the radial component of the relative velocity under the condition that the particle moves in the appropriate\ndirection for the event to occur.

Note that the\nformation and rupture of the liquid bridge is spatially separated, which gives rise to a hysteretic loss and a coupling between\nthe pair correlation functions g b for neighbors with and without, g u , capillary bridge. In this sketch the maximal liquid bridge\nlength scrit is drawn largely exaggerated. For a typical volume fraction of 1% wetting liquid added to the volume of jammed\ngranular matter one finds scrit /d \u2248 0.07 [11].\n\nEliminating those correlation coefficients that are identically zero (33, 38), we can arrange the coupling equations\nfor the domain of capillary interaction as a 6 \u00d7 6 matrix system:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb gu\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n1 1 \u22121 0\n0\n0\nc \u2190r\n0\nCollision:\nb\ng c \u2190r \uf8f7\n\uf8ec0\uf8f7\nWith Bridge: \uf8ec 0 \u03b3 b \u03b3 b 0 \u22121\n0 \uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\ng bc \u2192r \uf8f7\nUnconnected: \uf8ec \u03b3 u 0 0 \u22121 0\n\u22121 \uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7 = (1 \u2212 K/Ksites ) g at\n(45)\n\uf8f7\u25e6\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nu\nc \uf8ec 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\nStationarity: \uf8ec \u22121 0 0 0 \u03b3vol 0 \uf8f7 \uf8ec\ng\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ec c\u2192 r \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed gb\n0\nSpectators:\n0 0 0 \u22121 0 \u03b3pass\nc\u2192 r\nu\n1\nSource:\n1 0 0 0\n0 1/\u03b3 u\ngc\u2190 r\n\nThe \u03b3-functions in the matrix are to be evaluated at s = scrit . As it has to be on physical grounds, this system is\nnon-singular with determinant (1 + scrit /d)D\u22121 (2 + \u03b3pass ) \u03b3 b (scrit ) > 0.\nThe last row of the system (45) describes the creation of new liquid bridges as discussed before in the context\nof the equivalent Eq. (41). We remark that here we used that the correlation g at\nc of the dry system at contact has\nequal contributions from positive and negative relative velocities, immediately before and after the collision, which\nis still true for the wetted elastic particles we consider. This symmetry between positive and negative radial relative\nvelocities is broken if one wishes to introduce a restitution coefficient 0 < \u01eb < 1 to model inelastic collisions: the\ncontact correlation of positive velocities is then increased by a factor 1/\u01eb as compared to the negatives.\nOne should see clearly the very different meaning of K and Ksites . The dynamical quantity K is the number of\ninstantaneously existing capillary bonds:\nZ scrit\ng bc\nD\nK=2 D\u03c6\n\u03b3 b (s) \u03b3vol (s) ds .\n(46)\nd\n0\n\nK rapidly decays close to zero in dilute systems. As K comes closer to the value of Ksites in a very dense system,\nthe binding frequency fbind \u221d g uc \u2190r \u221d K \u2212 Ksites (43) goes to zero because steric hindrance prohibits the formation\nof further capillary contacts: K \u2212 Ksites gives the number of vacant sites for capillary bonds. Therefore Ksites is the\nmaximum number of 'docking sites' for capillary bonds. It is a pure geometric property and grows with scrit , because\nscrit > 0 still allows for a slight rearrangement of particles in the formation of new capillary bridges without breaking\nexisting ones. In the limit scrit \u2192 0, Ksites is the number of 'contact sites'. We therefore expect Ksites to equal the\nnumber of exact contacts, 2D = 4. So let us compute Ksites (\u03c6, scrit ) in the following paragraph.\nThe maximum number of possible bonds, Ksites , is an athermal function of density \u03c6 and the critical liquid bridge\nlength scrit . We determine Ksites from the obvious fact, that the granular dynamics is unaffected by the introduction\nof forceless bridges: for \u03b3 b = \u03b3 u we recover the dry contact correlation g bc + g uc = g at\nc . This is the athermal limit, or\nhigh temperature limit of wet granular matter.\n\u001a b\n\u03b3 = \u03b3u\nHigh temperature limit\n(47)\ng bc + g uc = g at\nc\n\n\f14\n\nK (T=0)\n\ncapillary bridge regime\n\nscrit / d\nFIG. 9: The capillary bridge coordination K in the low temperature limit, T \u226a Ecb . As proven in the text, K converges\nto the athermal function Ksites (\u03c6, scrit ) in this low temperature limit. The solid line is Ksites (\u03c6o , scrit ) over a wide range of\nmaximal bridge lengths scrit . Points represent final states of free cooling simulations with 1000 particles of uniformly distributed\npolydispersity \u2206d = 0.06d. The open symbols are clusters with winding number one (cylindrical topology), connected over\none periodic boundary on a rectangular domain. Such structures have internal tensile strength which necessitates a slightly\nincreased coordination, visible as a small shift compared to the closed symbols which represent localized clusters (as the two\nexamples drawn in the plot). As predicted by Eq. (51) of the presented theory, the structures emerging with exact contacts,\nscrit \u2192 0, are found to be precisely isostatic, Ksites = 4. The line is the the analytic result (50), for which very good agreement\nis found with the simulations over the entire range of the capillary bridge regime, 0 < s < 0.2r (with r the particle radius),\nwhich is indicated in the figure. Beyond this regime, the theory does not hold because in the derivation we limited ourselves to\nthe leading order in scrit /d. More importantly, the rupture length scrit cannot be further increased beyond the capillary regime\nby simply increasing the liquid content in the granular sample. As mentioned in the introduction, liquid bridges residing on\nthe same sphere would rather merge [21] into more complicated objects.\n\n6\n\n6\n\n5\n4\n\nKsites 5\n\nK\n\n3\n2\n\n4\n1\n\nfc\n\n0.75\n\n0.80\n\n0.85\n\nfmax\n0\n\n(A)\n\nf\n\n(B)\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nT / Ecb\n\nFIG. 10: (A) The maximum number of 'docking sites' for capillary bonds on a particle, Ksites , which is possible in two dimensions\ngiven the pinch-off length scrit of capillary bridges and the density \u03c6. Ksites is independent of the temperature because it is a\npure geometric quantity: the number of possible neighboring sites. Here Ksites is shown as a function of \u03c6 for different scrit\nranging from scrit /d = 0.07 (solid curve), 0.04, 0.02, to 0.01 (short dashes). As is shown in the text, Ksites is the coordination\nnumber in the zero temperature limit. While the mean coordination number K rapidly goes to zero with density for finite\ntemperature, the zero-temperature limit is \u2265 4 for all densities, because the system clusters. The dotted curve represents the\nlimit scrit \u2192 0. The longer scrit the closer Ksites comes to six, the number of next neighbors in two dimensions. In the limit\nscrit \u2192 0 the coordination Ksites converges to the number of exact contacts which is precisely four. (B) The capillary bridge\ncoordination K drops down in the vicinity of the critical temperature as clustered structures break up. For this plot the mean\ndensity is chosen to be \u03c6 = 0.75.\n\n\f15\nFrom the hysteretic bridge system (45) follows in this forceless or high granular temperature limit (47):\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b3 u \u03b3vol\n1\u2212\nKsites = (1 + \u03b3 u \u03b3vol ) K and\n1 + \u03b3pass\ng at\nc\n.\ng bc =\n1 + \u03b3 u \u03b3vol\n\n(48)\n(49)\n\nThe \u03b3-functions with the argument s suppressed are understood to be evaluated at s = scrit .

The result (51) is the second important\nconsistency test. Finding the number of exact contacts in the jamming limit to equal four in (12) showed the\nconsistency of the free-volume argument applied there. Here in (51) we find for any density that the different function\nKsites for the number of possible bridges sites equals four as well when scrit = 0. This is as intuitively expected and\na confirmation of the consistency between the hysteretic system (45) and the near-contact pair correlation. In view\nof the numerical finding Zsim = 2 for the derivative at contact of the pair correlation (as defined in (23)) we remark\nthat the entirely analytic description by the hysteretic system gives in general Ksites = 8/Z + O (scrit ), which is why\nthe consistency is non-trivial and the finding Zsim = 2 fits favorably into the entire picture.\nThus the hysteretic system (45) provides a direct connection between the static granular properties captured in\nKsites and the granular system in motion at positive granular temperature which we are treating in general. We\nremind that Ksites is determined by the steric self-hindrance and therefore a pure geometric property independent of\nthe granular temperature. When inspecting a snapshot of a close granular packing we can find local cases of contact\ncoordination (scrit = 0) higher than four. These are fluctuations within the granular ensemble, while Ksites and K are\nmean-field quantities. Of course, for a finite bridge length scrit > 0, a mean bridge coordination K \u2208 (0, Ksites ) with\nKsites higher than four is possible due to elongated bridges, as described by (50). Before we evaluated the expression\n(50) of Ksites for positive scrit (plotted in Fig. 9), it is enlightening to switch on the capillary forces in the following\nsection because this allows us to apply Ksites to 'frozen' wet granular matter.\nB.\n\nSwitching On the Force of Capillary Bridges\n\nUnder the attraction of a liquid bridge, the pair correlation g b (s) of connected neighbors falls off faster than g u (s)\nfor unbound particles, depending on the granular temperature T /Ecb compared to the bridge energy. The logarithmic\nderivative of the radial pair correlation is to be interpreted as the effective radial force [46, 47], \u03b2F = \u2202s ln g(s), as\ndiscussed before in section II B. This exponential dependence can be justified as the solution of the Fokker-Planck\nequation derived in [42]. Moreover, in the context of the hysteretic interaction of wet granular matter this exponential\nfactor has been successfully applied in the case D = 1 (cf. Eq. (3) in [1]). Therefore we proceed by switching on the\nliquid bridge force to the physical value of the Minimal Capillary model [11], Fb = Ecb /scrit , including this exponential\nin the short-range dependence of the pair correlation function for bridges neighbors:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nEcb s\n.\n(52)\n\u03b3 b (s, T ) = \u03b3 u (s) exp \u2212\nT scrit\nAt low granular temperatures this exponential gives rise to shorter average bridge lengths, and describes the reduced\nprobability that a bridge reaches its critical length scrit . Therefore the hysteretic system (45) describes the sticking\nof particles and the onset of clustering.\nWe have discussed in the previous section III A that steric effects in the dynamical system limit the mean number\nof bonds to a maximum of Ksites , and we derived that Ksites converges to the number of isostatic contacts in the limit\nscrit \u2192 0. Here this connection is put on firm grounds with a clear physical interpretation attributed to Ksites : Ksites\nis the bridge coordination K of solid wet granular matter.\n\n\f16\nProof of K \u2192 Ksites in the low temperature limit. Solving (45) for K/Ksites , we obtain\n1\nK(T, scrit, \u03c6)\n=\n,\nKsites (scrit , \u03c6)\n1 + X(T )/Y (T )\n\n(53)\n\nwith\nX(T ) = \u03b3 b (scrit , T ) Ksites (\u03b3pass + 2)\u03b3vol and\nY (T ) = 8I(T ) \u03c6g at\nc (\u03b3pass + 1) ,\nwhere I(T ) stands for the integral over bond states,\nZ scrit\nZ scrit\nE s\n\u0001\nT scrit\n\u2212 cb\n+ O T2 ,\ne T scrit \u03b3 u \u03b3vol ds/d =\n\u03b3 b \u03b3vol ds/d =\nI(T ) =\nEcb d\ns=0\ns=0\n\n(54)\n(55)\n\n(56)\n\nwhich goes linearly to zero, while \u03b3 b (T ) \u221d e\u2212Ecb /T vanishes for T \u2192 0 faster than any power of T . Hence X/Y \u2192 0\nso that Eq. (53) implies\nlim K = Ksites\n\nT \u21920\n\n(57)\n\nas conjectured.\nThis low temperature limit (T \u226a Ecb ) is of general interest since it represents a sticky gas of ideal spheres, which\nserves as a model for aggregation in various areas of physics [48] and astrophysics [49]: once two particles had contact,\nthe remaining degree of freedom is tangential motion. The analytic prediction of formula (51) is Ksites = 4 in the\nlimit of exact contacts, scrit = 0. In order to evaluate (50) for positive scrit we insert the near-contact decay \u03b3 u given\nby the general results (10), (14), and (32), setting D = 2. The explicit expression for \u03b3 u which we use throughout this\narticle for results without free parameters is given in the appendix B. Here we take into account known formulas for\nthe contact value g at\nc at low densities, as well as higher corrections to the free volume theory. Inserting this expression\nin (50) results in the curve shown in Fig. 9. We have performed simulations in this low-temperature limit. The wet\ngranular matter was initially prepared in a gas state with T = 50Ecb and cooled by the formation and rupture of\nbonds. The insets in Fig. 9 show final states when the granular temperature T is more than one order of magnitude\nbelow Ecb and no further change in the configuration was observed on exponential time scales. The symbols in Fig. 9\nhave been measured in this final state. In perfect agreement with the prediction of Eq. (51), we find in the contact\nlimit, scrit \u2192 0, the coordination to be exactly 4. Moreover, the increase in the number of bonds per particle with\nthe increase of the maximal bridge length scrit is found to be in very good agreement with the simulations.\nFurther analytic results for high densities are shown in Fig. 10 (A). As is intuitively clear and shown by the family\nof curves in Fig. 10 (A), the convergence of the limit scrit \u2192 0 is not uniform with respect to density, since Ksites is\npinned to the kissing number 6 of the monodisperse crystal density at \u03c6max .\nIV.\n\nTHE EQUATION OF STATE\n\nWe are now in the position to derive the equation of state, P = P (T, \u03c6), for wet granular matter with capillary\nbonds tensile up to the rupture length scrit . The cohesion of capillary bridges will reduce the pressure as compared\nto a dry hard-sphere system of equal temperature. By virtue of Eq. (53), we have the bridge coordination number K\nas a function of density \u03c6 and granular temperature T . Since in the Minimal Capillary model [11] the bridge force is\nassumed to be independent of the bridge length s, the knowledge of the mean number of bridges K will allow us to\nevaluate the reduction of the pressure due to cohesion. Furthermore, the particle-particle collisions are enhanced by\nfor wet granular matter derives\nthe bridge attraction, increasing the contact correlation.

Since there is one particle in each\nVorono\u0131\u0308 cell, the mean area equals the inverse density. In section II A we have used the Vorono\u0131\u0308 tessellation to compute the\nderivative of the pair correlation at contact for a dry and dense system. For such a dense system, the Vorono\u0131\u0308 cell resembles a\nhexagon with a size proportional to (d + s)2 , where s is the particle separation. The cell borders are at half surface separation\nfor polydisperse diameters (not half center distance), so that each cell contains one particle completely.\n\nThe analytic expression (58) for the contact correlation of wet granular matter, g wet\nc , is indeed strictly greater than\nthe one of the dry system, g at\n,\nto\nwhich\nit\nconverges\nin\nthe\nhigh\ntemperature\nlimit\nwhen the capillary energy Ecb\nc\nis small compared to the granular temperature T . This limit follows obviously from (58) because the functions with\nsuperscript index 'b' turn into those with 'u' for T \u226b Ecb . In the low temperature limit, liquid bonds oscillate with an\namplitude proportional to the kinetic energy which equals T on average, so that the probability to find the particles\nat contact, g wet\nc , grows proportional to 1/T , as can be derived easily from (58) using the expansion (56).\nA.\n\nFrozen Degrees of Freedom\n\nAs the system starts to cluster at temperatures close to Ecb , voids remain between the clusters with linear dimensions\nlarge compared to the particle diameter. Clearly, this growing length scale, which is set by the sizes of clusters and\nvoids, is not captured by the short-range behavior of the pair correlation function. Here we advance the theory beyond\nthe level of two-particle correlations to take correlation on large scales, such as the collective particle motion in a\ncluster, in an approximative fashion into account.\nThe collective motion of a cluster is due to stable capillary bonds which impose constraints, such that the internal\ndegrees of freedom\nof\u0011clusters are frozen. Since K is the number of instantaneous capillary bridges of which the\n\u0010p\nfraction erf\nEcb /T with kinetic energies below Ecb forms stable bonds, we have\nKfrozen = K erf\n\nr\n\nEcb\nT\n\n!\n\n(60)\n\nfor the number of frozen degrees of freedom.\nWe are interested in the density of the remaining degrees of freedom. The idea is simple and powerful: As a general\nmathematical property of triangulations, there are on average precisely six Vorono\u0131\u0308 neighbors [39], independent of\ndensity or ordering. In Fig. 11 we can observe that the Vorono\u0131\u0308 neighbors with stable bonds contribute less to the\narea 1/n of the Vorono\u0131\u0308 cell. This picture suggest a two-fluid model with frozen and free neighborhoods as the two\nconstituents. The fraction of frozen and free triangulation bonds is proportional to Kfrozen and Kfree respectively, and\nthe area contributions associated to each bond sum up to the total size of the Vorono\u0131\u0308 cell:\nKfrozen + Kfree = 6\n6\nKfrozen Kfree\n+\n=\n.\nnfrozen\nnfree\nn\n\n(61)\n(62)\n\nBecause of this reciprocal sum rule for the densities one may call this a reciprocal two-fluid model.\nThe density nfrozen of the stable bond component follows analogously to (2) when averaged with the additional\n\n\f18\nexponential factor (52) due to the capillary force:\n\u001c\u0010\n\u001d\ns \u0011D\nnJ\n1+\n=\nd\nnfrozen\nfrozen\nR scrit\n. . . \u03b3frozen (s) \u03b3vol (s) ds\nh. . . ifrozen = 0R scrit\n\u03b3frozen (s) \u03b3vol (s) ds\n0\n\u0012\n\u0014\u0010\n\u0015\n\u0013\ns \u0011D\nEcb s\nat\n\u03b3frozen (s) = exp \u2212\u03c6 g c\n1+\n\u22121 \u2212\nd\nT scrit\n\n(63)\n(64)\n(65)\n\nWithout affecting the leading order in s/d one is free to replace the last s in the exponent (65) by s + s2 /(2d), so that\nthe integral (63) is elementary resulting in\n\u0013\n\u0015 \u0012\n\u0014\u0010\nnJ\nscrit \u0011D\n1\n1\n(66)\n\u22121\n\u22121= 1+\n\u2212 \u03b1\nnfrozen\nd\n\u03b1 e \u22121\n\u0014\u0010\n\u0013\n\u0015\u0012\nscrit \u0011D\nEcb d\nwith \u03b1 = 1 +\n(67)\n\u2212 1 \u03c6 g at\n+\nc\nd\nT Dscrit\nWe point out that Eq. (66) implies Eq. (4) in [1] for D = 1.\nFrom the Eqs. (53), (60)-(62), and (66)-(67) follows the density of degrees of freedom which are not frozen out by\ncapillary bonds, nfree (T, scrit , \u03c6). One may regard nfree as the density of clusters.\nWe remark that the two-fluid model of neighborhoods is the only concept presented in this theory of wet granular\nmatter which cannot be generalized in a straight forward manner to three dimensions, because for D = 3 the number\nof Vorono\u0131\u0308 neighbors (double counted per particle) is not a universal constant (such as 6 for D = 2 and 2 for D = 1),\nbut depends on the granular order (reaching its minimum value 12 for close packing and its maximum of approximately\n15.5 in the ideal gas limit) [50]. The reason for this is that three-dimensional space cannot be filled with tetrahedrons,\nwhile flat space can be tiled by triangles. As a consequence, the number of constituents in the two-fluid model of\nneighborhoods would not be conserved for D = 3 and the numerator on the right-hand side of (62) is not a constant.\nB.\n\nThe Pressure of Wet Granular Matter\n\nHere we arrive at the pressure P (T, \u03c6) using the density nfree (T, \u03c6) (61) of degrees of freedom, the coordination\nK(T, \u03c6) (53), and the contact correlation g wet\nc (T, \u03c6) (58). The pressure is the trace of the stress tensor\nP =\u2212\n\n1\ntr\u03c3 .\nD\n\n(68)\n\nkin\n=\nThe stress tensor \u03c3 = \u03c3 kin + \u03c3 force describes the flow of momentum. The kinetic term has components \u03c3i,j\nE\nPN D (k) (k)\n(k)\n\u2212 k mvi vj \u03b4(r \u2212 r ) . With the granular temperature T = hmvi vi i, its trace yields nT for uncorrelated\n\nparticle motion (as in an ideal gas). In general we have the kinetic contribution\nP kin = nfree T\n\n(69)\n\nwherein there frozen degrees of freedom have been taken out. For moderate densities, one may interpret (69) as the\nkinetic contribution to the pressure due to a gas of clusters.\nThe interparticle forces F give rise to the Cauchy tensor \u03c3 force , which is the tensor product of the center-to-center\nvector r and the pair force F,\n\u03c3 force =\n\nnfree\nhF \u2297 ri ,\n2\n\n(70)\n\nso that \u03c3 force is diagonal for radial forces. The factor 1/2 assigns half of the momentum current to either of the\ninteraction particles, i.e. r/2 may be seen as the transport vector within the Vorono\u0131\u0308 cell. The Cauchy tensor (70)\nhas contributions only by the unfrozen pairs of particles with density nfree , because in frozen neighborhoods the\nrepulsive momentum exchanged in collisions is exactly balanced by the bridge attraction under the time average on\nthe right-hand side of (70).\nA comment on the significance of the reciprocal two-fluid model as represented by Eq. (61) and (62) is in order here.\nWe consider for instance a compressed state of wet granular matter with Kfrozen around five and Kfree around unity.\n\n\fP dD / Ecb\n\n19\n\nf = 0.1\n\nT / Ecb\nFIG. 12: The pressure P of wet granular matter is shown as function of the granular temperature T . The dimensionality\nis D = 2 and the covered area fraction is \u03c6 = 0.1, so that at high temperatures the system is a dilute gas. The maximum\nbridge length is scrit = 0.07d. The behavior below the critical temperature Tc = 0.274Ecb of wet granular can be understood in\nthe following way: the system agglutinates to clusters. With these effective particles the pressure is reduced according to the\nreduced number density of effective particles. The breakup of clusters is reflected by the rising pressure around Tc . The straight\nat\nline is the athermal pressure of hard discs, P dry = ngwall\nT which is reached asymptotically when the granular temperature is\nhigher than the energy scale Ecb set by the capillary interaction.\n\nWhile Kfree is small, the prefactor nfree in (70) is not necessarily small. From (61) and (62) follows that both, nfree\nand nfrozen , converge to nJ as the system gets jammed (n \u2192 nJ ), so that the repulsive dominated state is correctly\ndescribed by the Cauchy tensor (70) which grows beyond all bounds as n \u2192 nJ . If one had (in contradiction to the\nadditivity of areas) summed up densities linearly instead of the reciprocal sum rule (62), the free density would vanish\nor could even become negative under such conditions.\nIt is finally easy to determine the time average on the right-hand side of (70) for the two different forces acting in\nwet granular matter, the delta-force in collisions of hard particles and the flat force Fcb = Ecb /scrit of the capillary\nbonds. In a collision at time tcoll the radial momentum \u2206p is transferred instantaneously:\nD\nhFcoll \u2297 ri = h\u2206p \u2297 r \u03b4(t \u2212 tcoll )i = 1I h\u2206p (r, \u2212v) \u03b8 ((r, \u2212v)) \u03b4(r \u2212 d)i = \u22121I g wet\nc n\u03c3D d T .\n\n(71)\n\nIn the last equality the \u03b4-function gives rise to the contact correlation g wet\nand the trivial integration of angles leaves\nc\n\u03c3D dD\u22121 . 1I is the unity matrix and \u03b8 is the Heaviside step function.

The position of the critical point is described by the critical parameters (\u03c6c , Tc ), which are plotted on the left\nand right vertical axis respectively. Solid lines result from the full theory (74) by solving for the intersection of \u2202\u03c6 P (\u03c6, T ) = 0\nand \u2202\u03c62 P \u03c6, T = 0. For the critical temperature we find a very mild variation with the rupture length, so that over the entire\nphysically relevant range of capillary interaction we have Tc \u2248 Ecb /4. The influence of the rupture length scrit on the critical\ndensity \u03c6c can be \"understood very\n\" clearly with the help of the dashed line. The critical density is such that the mean particle\np\nseparation s = d D \u03c6J /\u03c6c \u2212 1 scales with the rupture length scrit . This shows that both intrinsic characteristics of the\ncapillary interaction, the rupture length and the bridge energy Ecb , determine the critical point of wet granular matter.\n\nclusters are predicted to segregate due to the mechanically unstable branch of the pressure as a function of density,\nwhich appears in Fig. 13 below the critical temperature. Figure 14 provides a close-up of the critical point of wet\ngranular matter and its spinodal. The critical density of this transition is high, because the particles have to be close\nenough in order to form a dynamical capillary network. As we show in Fig. 15, the critical density is determined by\nthe length scale of capillary bridges, such that the rupture length scrit scales with the mean particle separation s.\nMoreover, the rupture length is approximately four times the mean particle separation, scrit \u2248 4s (dashed line shown\nin Fig. 15 for comparison). This result is to be compared with the very same ratio for the reported critical density\nof the un-clustering effect [1]: in the free cooling of dense one-dimension wet granular matter, the granular network\nwas found to break up into granular droplets which precipitate out of the homogenous intial state, as soon as the\ndensity exceeded a critical value. This critical density was shown numerically and analytically to be set by scrit \u2248 3s\n[1]. The different prefactor is due to the additional cooling dynamics and the dimensionality D = 1. The theory of\nwet granular matter presented in this work predicts this transition to persist in higher dimensions.\nAs we shorten the rupture length scrit (which can be easily done experimentally by evaporating the wetting liquid),\nthe dry system is approached in such a way that the spinodal narrows in the T \u2212 \u03c6 plane and is shifted to the\njamming point, where it eventually shrinks to a line and vanishes. Figure 15 shows the convergence of the critical\ndensity to the jamming density. Since the capillary bridge regime sets an upper limit on the rupture length, the critical\npoint is confined on the density axis between the ordering transition at \u03c6o and the jamming density \u03c6J . The critical\ntemperature almost exclusively depends on the bridge energy, according to Tc \u2248 Ecb /4, over the entire capillary\nregime.\nWith this discussion of transitions occurring in wet granular matter the presentation of our theory for wet granular\nmatter is completed. The reader may find in appendix C a brief methodical extension of the theory where a selfconsistent equation is derived for future works.\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nStarting with the hard-sphere fluid, an expression (10) for the narrowing of the near contact pair correlation was\nderived, which describes in the jamming limit the delta-peak of 2D isostatic contacts per particle, in agreement with\nthe excepted value of simulations. In the gas and fluid regime the fall-off predicted by this expression for the pair\n\n\f22\ncorrelation at contact was found to be well confirmed by simulations. We then addressed the nonequilibrium case\nof wet granular matter by the introduction of capillary bridges which are formed hysteretically. The description in\nterms of the pair-correlation function was extended with six different non-vanishing correlation coefficients which take\nthe bridge status into accoount and allow for the hysteretic dissipative dynamics. The coordination number of bonds\nwas computed analytically as a function of the rupture length of the capillary bridges, the granular temperature,\nand the density. The limiting case of strong bonds led to the sticky gas dynamics for which simulations have been\nperformed which showed very good agreement with the analytic prediction of the coordination number. Based on\nthe derived expressions for the contact correlation and the bridge coordination, we finally computed the pressure of\nwet granular matter analytically as a function of density and granular temperature. Here a method was put forward,\nwhich describes the effective degrees of freedoms in order to take the correlated motion of particles glued to clusters\ninto account. The isotherms of wet granular matter were found to have an unstable branch which gives rise to the\nsegregation of dense clusters. The critical temperature of this transition was derived to be approximately one quarter\nof the capillary bond energy. The critical density is directly related to the pinch-off distance of the capillary bridges. A\nclose relation to the un-clustering effect reported in one dimension [1] was shown, for which reason this effect persists\nalso in higher dimensions.\nIt will be interesting to probe the critical point of wet granular matter experimentally and by direct simulations.\nAs we have shown, the position of the critical point is determined by the length and energy of the capillary bridges.\nThese quantities can be controlled very accurately in an experiment of shaken wet granular matter. Therefore the\nmeasurement of the critical temperature will allow to discern between extensions such as the nonlinear coupling\ndiscussed in appendix C.\nFuture analytic work includes the background contribution gB in the dense regime, since our numerics indicate that\nthe pair correlation is flatter near the contact as predicted by gA alone. This task might be addressed in conjunction\nwith the analogous background contribution in three dimensions, for which in the jamming limit an integrable powerlaw divergence, gB \u221d 1/s\u03b4 , has been reported in numerical studies (with \u03b4 = 0.5 [51] or \u03b4 = 0.6 [32]) and experiments\n[52], but is as well lacking a theoretical explanation at present.\nAcknowledgments Discussions with Martin Brinkmann, Svenja Hager, J\u00fcrgen Vollmer, Klaus R\u00f6ller and Mario\nScheel are greatfully acknowledged.\nAPPENDIX A: THE BACKGROUND CONTRIBUTION gB\n1.\n\nThe Weighting Factors\n\nWith gA in (10) we considered the four (cf. Eq. 12) A-neighbors, which form isostatic contacts at jamming, sA \u2192 0\nfor \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6J (3), and are separated by sA according to Eq. (4) before jamming. Analogously, the separation sB of the\ntwo B-neighbors is weighted by\n!\n\u00012\n1 + sdB \u2212 1\nPB (sB ) \u221d exp \u2212\n.\n(A1)\n\u03c6max /\u03c6 \u2212 1\nWhile in Eq. (4) the denominator in the exponential is cA = \u03c6J /\u03c6 \u2212 1 so that sA \u2192 0 at the jamming density, in\nEq. (A1) the denominator is cB = \u03c6max /\u03c6 \u2212 1 since the blocked B is only forced to form a contact, sB \u2192 0, for a\nperfect crystal with \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6max . Of course this limit is kinematically unreachable because the system comes to rest\nat the jamming density \u03c6J < \u03c6max . \u03c6max would be reached. We note that cB is a small dimensionless quantity: for\n\u03c6 > \u03c6o = 0.71 we have 0 < cB < 0.2774.\nClose to jamming, the B-neighbors are fixed in space by particles other than the reference particle. Except for\narch-like constructions which are rare for frictionless particles, and would include second Vorono\u0131\u0308 neighbors keeping\nB at a separation larger than our region of interest, sB > scrit , this hindrance is due to the A-neighbors. Therefore\nthe probability gB (sB ) to find a B-neighbor at separation sB from the reference particle (sketched with hatching in\nFig. 17) is given by the integral over all configurations where four A-neighbors hinder two B-neighbors.\nThe configurations will be weighted by a phase space factor C and the exponential factor PB . We are above the\nordering density \u03c6o , so that the neighborhood has (by definition of the phase) hexagonal order as sketched in the\ninset of Fig. 16. Projecting the configurations with the two B-neighbors blocked (gray subset in Fig. 16) on a single\n\u03b8-axis, we find the configuration space factor\nC(\u03b8) =\n\n3(5\u03c0 \u2212 6\u03b8)\n.\n2\u03c0 2\n\n(A2)\n\n\f23\n\nq3\n\nq3\nA3\nA4\n\nB1\n\nA2\nA1\n\nq2\n\nB2\nq1\n\nq2\n\nq1\n\np/3\n\n2p/3\n\np\n\nFIG. 16: The angular configuration space of four neighbors close to the reference particle. These we denote as A-neighbors.\nThe faceted inner subset shown in gray is the subspace conditioned to the property that two further particles, the B-neighbors,\nare hinder by the A-particles in approaching the reference particle. The projection of this subset onto an \u03b8-axis (for the\nangle between a blocking A-pair, \u03b81 or \u03b83 in this example) gives rise to a linear configuration space factor C(\u03b8). Obviously\na B-neighbor acts like a wedge driven between two A-neighbors, and therefore increases \u03b8. This is taken into account by the\nweighting factor PB (sB ) which favors shorter separations sB between the particle B and the reference particle, depending on\nthe density \u03c6.\n\nIn the sequel we abbreviate\n\u03b3vol (s) \u221d 1 + s/d .\n\n(A3)\n\nfor the volume factor (A1) in D = 2. Wide gaps of length sB are exponentially suppressed by PB .\n2.\n\nThe Configuration Space\n\nLet us now address the configuration space plotted in Fig. 17.

The probability gB (sB ) to find a B-neighbor at a separation sB follows from integrating over the gray\ndomain, which grows with increasing sB . The lower bound, \u03b8S (sA , sB ), is plotted for the values sB = 0.05, 0.30, and 0.60. Large\nareas spanned by this neighborhood are exponentially rare the higher the mean density \u03c6, so that the probability distribution\nin this plot concentrates in the vicinity of the upper left corner P as we come closer to the jamming limit. At the line QR the\nB-neighbor slips through and turns into an A-neighbor, so that QR is the transit to another jamming island in configuration\nspace. The corresponding transition rate is proportional to the probability density along QR and therefore vanishes in the\njamming limit.\n\nFIG. 18: The sA -\u03b8-plot of Fig. 17 with the full sB dependence shown on the additional vertical axis.\n\n\f25\nwhere B hits A.\nThe simple lower bound on \u03b8,\n\u03b8min (sA )\n=\ncos\n2\n\ns\n\n1\u2212\n\n\u0012\n\nd/2\nd + sA\n\n\u00132\n\n,\n\n(A8)\n\nwhich ensures that the A-neighbors\ndo not overlap is without applicatory relevance, as it implies that the B-neighbor\n\u221a\nis pushed out to sB /d > 3 \u2212 1 \u2248 0.73.

Since there are two independent A-neighbors involved, their configuration is the direct product\n(sA1 , \u03b81 ) \u00d7 (sA2 , \u03b82 ). On this account the configuration integral is squared in (A10), with the important consequence\nthat the leading order in gB (sB ) is quadratical. The normalization constant N is determined by the knowledge that\nthere are two B-neighbors.

Hence the result (14).\nAPPENDIX B: EXPLICIT EXPRESSIONS FOR THE PAIR CORRELATION IN TWO DIMENSIONS\nWITHOUT FREE PARAMETERS\n\nIn our general derivation of the theory of wet granular \u221a\nmatter we distinguished between the jamming density \u03c6J\nand the (highest possible) crystalline packing \u03c6max = \u03c0/(2 3) achieved in monodisperse domains. The exact value of\nthe jamming density \u03c6J depends on many details such as the distribution of polydispersity and the jamming protocol\nfor the increase of density. When we want to give explicit results without free parameters on the bridge coordination\nK(T, \u03c6, scrit ) and the equation of state P = P (T, \u03c6, scrit ) we do this for weak polydispersity, where the difference\nbetween \u03c6J and \u03c6max is negligible and the limiting case of 'dry' discs has been studied extensively.\n1.\n\nHigh Density\n\nFor monodisperse 'dry' discs, \u03c6J = \u03c6max , there are higher order corrections to the free volume result (9) available\nin the literature which are incorporated in the final results on the bridge coordination and the equation of state for\nwet granular matter.

The center column shows the results of the Scaled Particle Theory and the right column\ncontains the exact expression for one dimension, and heuristic expressions [59] of Henderson [60] for two dimensions and\nCarnahan-Starling [61] in three dimensions.\n\nEquation (B1) holds in the dense regime, \u03c6o < \u03c6 < \u03c6max , above \u03c6o = 0.71. The numerical coefficients are a0 = \u22121.07\nand a2 = 5.89 [29], confirmed by our own simulations. Similar empirical expressions are also available for polydisperse\ndiscs in the glass state (Eq. (6) in [22]).\n2.\n\nLow and Moderate Density\n\nFor the analytic treatment an explicit expression for the contact correlation gcat in Eq. (32) is needed (as the\ncounterpart to the dense expression (B1)). Aside from the trivial one-dimensional case [66], exact expressions for the\ncontact correlation of hard spheres are unknown for the dilute regime. Yet there are well-established approximations in\nthe literature resulting from Scaled Particle theory [54, 55], from the virial expansions [56], as solutions of the PercusYevick closure [57], as well as heuristic expressions [58] such as the Carnahan-Starling formula with corrections to\nbetter fit simulation results (cf. Tab. I).\nAs in the dense regime B 1 we shall use the Henderson-Luding expression [29]\ngcdilute =\n\n1 \u2212 7\u03c6/16\n(1 \u2212 \u03c6)\n\n2\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c63 /128\n(1 \u2212 \u03c6)\n\n(B2)\n\n4\n\nfor the uncaged regime, 0 < \u03c6 < \u03c6o , and the merging function m(\u03c6) = 1/(1 + exp((\u03c6o \u2212 \u03c6)/m0 )) with a cross-over\nwidth m0 = 0.0111 to smoothly connect the dense (B1) and dilute (B2) expressions [29]:\ng(s) = m(\u03c6) g dilute (s) + (1 \u2212 m(\u03c6)) g dense (s)\n\n(B3)\n\nwith g dilute (0) = gcdilute and g dense (0) = gcdense as given by the Eqs. (B1) and (B2). The near-contact decay has been\nestablished in the Eqs. (10) and (14) for \u03c6 > \u03c6o , and in Eq.

We may therefore proceed by introducing the hysteretic\ncapillary bridges.\n\n\f28\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nFIG. 20: A typical graphical solution of the self-consistent equation (C2). Here the density is chosen to be \u03c6 = 0.6 and the\ngranular temperature is T = 0.2Ecb .\n\nAPPENDIX C: SELF-CONSISTENCY OF BRIDGE COORDINATION K\n\nAll results presented so far on the coordination K(\u03c6, T ) and pressure P (\u03c6, T ) allowed explicit analytic results. Here\nwe want to demonstrate how to treat more complicated source terms of the hysteretic system (45) numerically. Such\nan extension of the theory could be motivated as follows. The current of free (unbound) approaching particles could\nbe a function of the free density nfree instead of the mean density, since some of the unconnected neighbors traverse\nthe voids between clusters, so that Eq. (41) is changed to\nu\nat\nu\n\u03c6 g uc \u2190r + \u03c6 gc\u2190\nr /\u03b3 (scrit ) = (1 \u2212 K/Ksites ) \u03c6free g c (\u03c6free ) .\n\n(C1)\n\nObviously this approach is a lower estimate for the current of freely approaching particles, which is why (C1) is\nconsidered as a methodical example rather than a physical competitor to the theory presented above.\nWith the altered Eq. (C1) the hysteretic system (45) can still be solved analytically to find the correlation coefficients\nu\nb\nu\ng = {g uc \u2190r , g bc \u2190r , g bc \u2192r , gc\u2192\nr , gc\u2192 r , gc\u2190 r }. Unlike before, due to the coupling (C1) and the Eqs. (60)-(62), the\ncorrelations g are a highly nonlinear function of K. Therefore Eq. (46) becomes a nonlinear self-consistent equation:\nK(g(K, \u03c6, T ), \u03c6, T ) = K .\n\n(C2)\n\nThe physical value K(\u03c6, T ) of the coordination is the solution K of (C2). The numerical solution of (C2) is found to be\nvery robust, as Fig. 20 indicates. Plugging the resulting self-consistent K(\u03c6, T ) back into the equation for the pressure\n(74) of wet granular matter, we find that the critical point is shifted from Tc = 0.273(5)Ecb to Tc = 0.216(5)Ecb.\nThis reduction of the critical temperature is intuitively clear since with less particles arriving to form bonds, the wet\ngranular matter 'evaporates' at lower granular temperatures.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n\nA.
