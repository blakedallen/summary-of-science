This letter concentrates\non one aspect of jet production, namely, the comparison of jet cross sections for the\nsame reaction at different centre-of-mass energies. This highlights the effects of scaling\nviolations, while a QCD analysis of jet-production rates allows the measurement of the\nstrong coupling constant, \u03b1s .\nThe parton model predicts a jet cross section that scales with the centre-of-mass energy. In\njet\njet\nthis case, the scaled jet invariant cross section, (ETjet )4 E jet d3 \u03c3/dpjet\nX dpY dpZ , as a function\nof the dimensionless variable xT \u2261 2ETjet /W , should be independent of W , where W is\nthe centre-of-mass energy, E jet is the jet energy, ETjet is the jet transverse energy and\njet jet\n(pjet\nX , pY , pZ ) are the components of the jet momentum. Thus, the ratio of scaled jet\ninvariant cross sections for different centre-of-mass energies will be unity for all xT . On the\nother hand, QCD predicts that jet cross sections should exhibit a non-scaling behaviour,\ndue both to the evolution of the structure functions of the colliding hadrons and to the\nrunning of \u03b1s . Scaling violations have been observed in the ratio of the scaled jet invariant\ncross sections as a function of xT in pp\u0304 collisions at centre-of-mass energies of either 546\nor 630 and 1800 GeV [1].\nAt HERA, similar tests can be made in the photoproduction of jets. Two types of QCD\nprocesses contribute to jet production in \u03b3p interactions at O(\u03b1\u03b1s ) [2,3]: either the photon\ninteracts directly with a parton in the proton (the direct process) or the photon acts as\na source of partons, one of which interacts with a parton in the proton (the resolved\nprocess). Violations of scaling should be observed both in resolved and direct processes.\nFurthermore, measurements of high-ETjet jet cross sections in \u03b3p interactions over a wide\nrange of ETjet allow a determination of \u03b1s (MZ ) as well as its energy-scale dependence.\nThis letter presents a measurement of the inclusive jet cross section in \u03b3p interactions as\na function of ETjet in the \u03b3p centre-of-mass-energy range 142 < W\u03b3p < 293 GeV for jets\nwith pseudorapidity \u22121 < \u03b7 jet < 2.5. Scaled jet invariant cross sections are also presented\njet\njet\nas a function of xT for hW\u03b3p i = 180 and 255 GeV in the region \u22122 < \u03b7\u03b3p\n< 0, where \u03b7\u03b3p\nis the jet pseudorapidity in the \u03b3p centre-of-mass frame.\n\n2\n\nExperimental conditions\n\nThe data were collected during the running period 1998-2000, when HERA operated with\nprotons of energy Ep = 920 GeV and electrons or positrons of energy Ee = 27.5 GeV, and\ncorrespond to an integrated luminosity of 82.2 \u00b1 1.9 pb1. A detailed description of the\n1\n\n\fZEUS detector can be found elsewhere [4, 5]. A brief outline of the components that are\nmost relevant for this analysis is given below.\nCharged particles are tracked in the central tracking detector (CTD) [6], which operates\nin a magnetic field of 1.43 T provided by a thin superconducting solenoid. The CTD\nconsists of 72 cylindrical drift-chamber layers, organized in nine superlayers covering the\npolar-angle1 region 15\u25e6 < \u03b8 < 164\u25e6 . The transverse-momentum resolution for full-length\ntracks can be parameterised as \u03c3(pT )/pT = 0.0058pT \u2295 0.0065 \u2295 0.0014/pT , with pT in\nGeV. The tracking system was used to measure the interaction vertex with a typical\nresolution along (transverse to) the beam direction of 0.4 (0.1) cm and to cross-check the\nenergy scale of the calorimeter.\nThe high-resolution uranium\u2013scintillator calorimeter (CAL) [7] covers 99.7% of the total\nsolid angle and consists of three parts: the forward (FCAL), the barrel (BCAL) and\nthe rear (RCAL) calorimeters. Each part is subdivided transversely into towers and\nlongitudinally into one electromagnetic section (EMC) and either one (in RCAL) or two (in\nBCAL and FCAL) hadronic sections (HAC). The smallest subdivision of the calorimeter\nis called a cell. Under test-beam conditions, the CAL single-particle relative energy\np\np\nresolutions were \u03c3(E)/E = 0.18/ E (GeV) for electrons and \u03c3(E)/E = 0.35/ E (GeV)\nfor hadrons.\nThe luminosity was measured from the rate of the bremsstrahlung process e+ p \u2192 e+ \u03b3p.\nThe resulting small-angle energetic photons were measured by the luminosity monitor [8],\na lead-scintillator calorimeter placed in the HERA tunnel at Z = \u2212107 m.\n\n3\n\nData selection and jet search\n\nA three-level trigger system was used to select events online [5,9]. At the first level, events\nwere triggered by a coincidence of a regional or transverse energy sum in the CAL and at\nleast one track from the interaction point measured in the CTD. At the second level, a\ntotal transverse energy of at least 8 GeV, excluding the energy in the eight CAL towers\nimmediately surrounding the forward beampipe, was required, and cuts on CAL energies\nand timing were used to suppress events caused by interactions between the proton beam\nand residual gas in the beampipe. At the third level, a jet algorithm was applied to\nthe CAL cells and jets were reconstructed using the energies and positions of these cells.\nEvents with at least one jet with ET > 10 GeV and \u03b7 < 2.5 were accepted.\n1\n\nThe ZEUS coordinate system is a right-handed Cartesian system, with the Z axis pointing in the\nproton beam direction, referred to as the \"forward direction\", and the X axis pointing left towards\nthe centre of HERA. The coordinate origin is at the nominal interaction point.\n\n2\n\n\fEvents from collisions between quasi-real photons and protons were selected offline using\nsimilar criteria to those reported in a previous publication [10]. The main steps are briefly\ndiscussed here. After requiring a reconstructed event vertex consistent with the nominal\ninteraction position and cuts based on the tracking information, the contamination from\nbeam-gas interactions, cosmic-ray showers and beam-halo muons was negligible. Charged\ncurrent deep inelastic scattering (DIS) events were rejected by requiring the total missing\ntot\ntransverse momentum, pmiss\nT , to be small compared to the total transverse energy, ET ,\np\n\u221a\ni.e. pmiss\nETtot < 2 GeV. Any neutral current (NC) DIS events with an identified\nT /\nscattered-positron or electron candidate in the CAL [11] were removed from the sample\nusing the method described previously [12]. The remaining background from NC DIS\nevents was estimated by Monte Carlo (MC) techniques to be below 0.3% and was neglected. The selected sample consisted of events from ep interactions with Q2 . 1 GeV2\nand a median Q2 \u2248 10\u22123 GeV2 , where Q2 is the virtuality of the exchanged photon. The\nevents were restricted to \u03b3p centre-of-mass energies in the range 142 < W\u03b3p < 293 GeV,\nas described in Section 6.\nThe longitudinally invariant kT cluster algorithm [13] was used in the inclusive mode [14]\nto reconstruct jets in the hadronic final state from the energy deposits in the CAL cells.\nThe jet search was performed in the pseudorapidity-azimuth (\u03b7\u2212\u03c6) plane of the laboratory\nframe. The jet variables were defined according to the Snowmass convention [15]. The\njets reconstructed from the CAL cell energies are called calorimetric jets and the variables\njet\njet\nassociated with them are denoted by ET,cal\n, \u03b7cal\nand \u03c6jet\ncal . A total of 197 155 events with\njet\njet\nat least one jet satisfying ET,cal > 13 GeV and \u22121 < \u03b7cal < 2.5 were selected.\n\n4\n\nMonte Carlo simulation\n\nThe MC programs PYTHIA 6.1 [16] and HERWIG 5.9 [17] were used to generate resolved\nand direct photoproduction events. In both generators, the partonic processes are simulated using leading-order matrix elements, with the inclusion of initial- and final-state parton showers. Fragmentation into hadrons was performed using the Lund string model [18]\nas implemented in JETSET [19] in the case of PYTHIA, and a cluster model [20] in the\ncase of HERWIG. The generated events were used for calculating energy and acceptance\ncorrections. The corrections provided by PYTHIA were used as default values and those\ngiven by HERWIG were used to estimate the systematic uncertainties coming from the\ntreatment of the parton shower and hadronisation. Samples of PYTHIA including multiparton interactions [21] with a minimum transverse momentum for the secondary scatter\nof 1 GeV [22] were used to study the effects of a possible \"underlying event\".\nAll generated events were passed through the ZEUS detector- and trigger-simulation pro-\n\n3\n\n\fgrams based on GEANT 3.13 [23]. They were reconstructed and analysed by the same\nprogram chain as the data. The jet search was performed using the energy measured in\nthe CAL cells in the same way as for the data. The same jet algorithm was also applied\nto the final-state particles; the jets found in this way are referred to as hadronic jets.\n\n5\n\nFixed-order QCD calculations\n\nThe QCD calculations, at both leading order (LO) and next-to-leading order (NLO),\nused in this analysis are based on the program by Klasen, Kleinwort and Kramer [24].\nThe calculations use the phase-space-slicing method [25] with an invariant-mass cut to\nisolate the singular regions of the phase space. The number of flavours was set to five; the\nrenormalisation, \u03bcR , and factorisation scales, \u03bcF , were set to \u03bcR = \u03bcF = \u03bc = ETjet ; \u03b1s was\n(5)\ncalculated at two loops using \u039bMS = 220 MeV, which corresponds to \u03b1s (MZ ) = 0.1175.\nThe MRST99 [26] parameterisations of the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the\nproton and the GRV [27] sets for the photon were used as defaults for the comparisons\nwith the measured cross sections.\nSince the measurements refer to jets of hadrons, whereas the QCD calculations refer to\npartons, the predictions were corrected to the hadron level using the MC models. The\nmultiplicative correction factor, Chad , defined as the ratio of the cross section for jets of\nhadrons over that for jets of partons, was estimated with the PYTHIA and HERWIG\nprograms. The values of Chad obtained with PYTHIA were taken as the defaults; the\npredictions from the two models were in good agreement. The values of Chad differed\nfrom unity by less than 2.5%.\n\n6\n\nEnergy and acceptance corrections\n\nThe comparison of the reconstructed jet variables for the hadronic and the calorimetric jets\njet\nin simulated events showed that no correction was needed for \u03b7 jet and \u03c6jet (\u03b7 jet \u2243 \u03b7cal\nand\njet\njet\n\u03c6 \u2243 \u03c6cal ). However, the transverse energy of the calorimetric jet was an underestimate\nof the corresponding hadronic jet energy by an average of \u223c 15%, with an r.m.s. of\n\u223c 10%. This underestimation was mainly due to the energy lost by the particles in the\ninactive material in front of the CAL. The transverse-energy corrections to calorimetric\njet\njet\njets, as a function of \u03b7cal\nand ET,cal\nand averaged over \u03c6jet\ncal , were determined using the\nMC events. Henceforth, jet variables without subscript refer to the corrected values.\nAfter these corrections to the jet transverse energy, events with at least one jet satisfying\nETjet > 17 GeV and \u22121 < \u03b7 jet < 2.5 were retained.\n4\n\n\f\u221a\nThe \u03b3p centre-of-mass energy is given by W\u03b3p = sy, where y is the inelasticity variable\n\u221a\nand s is the ep centre-of-mass energy, s = 4Ee Ep . The inelasticity variable was reconstructed using the method of Jacquet-Blondel [28], yJB = (E \u2212 pZ )/2Ee , where E is the\ntotal CAL energy and pZ is the Z component of the energy measured in the CAL cells.\nThe value of y was systematically underestimated by \u223c 20% with an r.m.s. of \u223c 10%.\nThis effect, which was due to energy lost in the inactive material in front of the CAL and\nto particles lost in the rear beampipe, was satisfactorily reproduced by the MC simulation\nof the detector. The MC event samples were therefore used to correct for this underestimation [29] and obtain ycor . Events were required to have 142 < W\u03b3p < 293 GeV, where\n\u221a\nW\u03b3p = sycor .\nThe variable xT was reconstructed using the corrected values of ETjet and W\u03b3p . Its resolujet\ntion was \u223c 12%. The variable \u03b7\u03b3p\nwas computed by boosting \u03b7 jet to the \u03b3p centre-of-mass\njet\njet\nframe using the formula \u03b7\u03b3p\n= \u03b7 jet \u2212ln(2Ep /W\u03b3p ). The comparison of \u03b7\u03b3p\nfor the hadronic\nand the calorimetric jets in simulated events showed a good correlation, so that no corjet\nrection was needed. The resolution on \u03b7\u03b3p\nwas \u223c 0.08.\nThe PYTHIA MC event samples of resolved and direct processes were used to compute the\nacceptance corrections to the jet distributions. These correction factors took into account\nthe efficiency of the trigger, the selection criteria and the purity and efficiency of the jet\nreconstruction. The contributions from direct and resolved processes in the MC models\nwere added according to a fit to the uncorrected data distribution of the energy deposited\njet\nin the RCAL. A reasonable description of the ETjet , \u03b7 jet , W\u03b3p , \u03b7\u03b3p\nand xT distributions in\nthe data was provided by both PYTHIA and HERWIG. The differential inclusive jet cross\nsections were obtained by applying bin-by-bin corrections to the measured distributions.\nThese correction factors differed from unity by typically less than 10%.\n\n7\n\nExperimental uncertainties\n\nA detailed study of the experimental systematic uncertainties of the cross-section measurements included the following sources:\n\u2022 the effect of the presence of a possible underlying event was estimated by using the\nsamples of PYTHIA including multiparton interactions to evaluate the correction factors. This effect was typically 5% and increased to \u223c 10% in the high-xT tail of the\nscaled jet invariant cross sections;\n\u2022 the effect of the treatment of the parton shower and hadronisation was estimated by\nusing the HERWIG generator to evaluate the correction factors. The uncertainty in\nthe cross sections was typically 2%;\n\n5\n\n\f\u2022 the effect of the uncertainty on the modelling of the Q2 spectrum of resolved processes in the MC was estimated by using the different approximations implemented in\nPYTHIA and HERWIG. The uncertainty in the cross sections was below 2%;\n\u2022 the effect of the uncertainty on W\u03b3p was estimated by varying yJB by \u00b11% in simulated\nevents. The uncertainty in the cross sections was below 1% at low ETjet , increasing to\n\u223c 3% at high ETjet ;\n\u2022 the effect of the uncertainty on the parameterisations of the proton and photon PDFs\nwas estimated by using alternative sets of PDFs in the MC simulation to calculate\nthe correction factors. The variation of the cross sections was smaller than 1% in each\ncase.\nThe uncertainty on the simulation of the trigger was negligible. All the above systematic\nuncertainties were added in quadrature, giving a total systematic uncertainty in the cross\nsections of 5% at low ETjet , increasing to \u223c 10% at high ETjet . The absolute energy scale\nof the calorimetric jets in simulated events was varied by its uncertainty of \u00b11% [10, 30].\nThe effect of this variation on the inclusive jet cross sections was typically \u22135% at low\nETjet increasing to \u221310% at high ETjet . This uncertainty is highly correlated between\nmeasurements in different bins. The uncertainty in the luminosity determination of 2.25%\nwas not included.\n\n8\n\nUncertainties on the theoretical predictions\n\nThe following uncertainties were considered:\n\u2022 the uncertainty on the NLO calculations due to higher-order terms was estimated by\nvarying \u03bc between ETjet /2 and 2ETjet . It was less than 10% and mainly affected the\nnormalisation. In the ratio of the scaled jet invariant cross sections, it was less than\n2.5%;\n\u2022 the uncertainty on the NLO calculations due to the uncertainties on the photon PDFs\nwas estimated by using an alternative set of parameterisations, AFG-HO [31]. The\neffect was below 5% for the cross sections and 2% for the ratio;\n\u2022 the uncertainty on the NLO calculations due to the statistical and correlated systematic experimental uncertainties of each data set used in the determination of the proton\nPDFs was calculated, making use of the results of an analysis [32] that provided the\ncovariance matrix of the fitted PDF parameters and the derivatives as a function of\nBjorken x and \u03bc2F . The resulting uncertainty in the cross sections was 1% at low ETjet\nand increased to 5% at high ETjet . The uncertainty in the ratio of the scaled jet invariant cross sections was below 0.3%. To estimate the uncertainties on the cross sections\n\n6\n\n\fdue to the theoretical uncertainties affecting the extraction of the proton PDFs, the\ncalculation of all the differential cross sections was repeated using a number of different parameterisations obtained under different theoretical assumptions in the DGLAP\nfit [32]. This uncertainty was below 3% for the cross sections and negligible for the\nratio;\n\u2022 the uncertainty on the NLO calculations due to that on \u03b1s (MZ ) was estimated by\nvarying \u03b1s (MZ ) within its uncertainty [33] and, simultaneously, by repeating the calculations using two additional sets of proton PDFs, MRST99\u2191\u2191 and MRST99\u2193\u2193, determined assuming \u03b1s (MZ ) = 0.1225 and 0.1125, respectively. The difference between\nthe calculations using these sets and MRST99 was scaled by 60% to reflect the current\nuncertainty on the world average of \u03b1s [33]. The resulting uncertainty in the cross\nsections was \u223c 8% at low ETjet decreasing to \u223c 2% at high ETjet . The uncertainty in\nthe ratio of the scaled jet invariant cross sections was below 4%;\n\u2022 the difference in the hadronisation corrections as predicted by PYTHIA and HERWIG\nresulted in an uncertainty smaller than 2.5%.\nAll the above theoretical uncertainties were added in quadrature.\n\n9\n9.1\n\nResults\nInclusive jet differential cross sections\n\nUsing the selected data, inclusive jet differential cross sections were measured for 142 <\nW\u03b3p < 293 GeV. The cross sections were determined for jets with ETjet > 17 GeV and\n\u22121 < \u03b7 jet < 2.5. There were 113 843 events, containing 145 797 jets, in this kinematic\nregion.\nThe cross-section d\u03c3/dETjet , measured in the ETjet range between 17 and 95 GeV, is presented in Fig. 1 and Table 1. The data points are located at the weighted mean of each ETjet\nbin. The measured d\u03c3/dETjet falls by over five orders of magnitude in this ETjet range. Figjet\njet\nure 2 and Table 2 show the scaled jet invariant cross-section, (ETjet )4 hE jet d3 \u03c3/dpjet\nX dpY dpZ i\u03b7 ,\njet\naveraged over the range \u22122 < \u03b7\u03b3p\n< 0, as a function of xT for hW\u03b3p i values of 180 and\n255 GeV; the hW\u03b3p i values were chosen as the centres of the intervals 169-191 GeV and\njet\n240-270 GeV. The measurements were restricted to the same range in \u03b7\u03b3p\nto have the\nsame acceptance for the two hW\u03b3p i intervals.\nFixed-order QCD calculations are compared to the data in Fig. 1. The LO QCD calculation underestimates the measured cross section by about 50% for ETjet < 45 GeV. The\ncalculation that includes NLO corrections gives a good description of the data within\n\n7\n\n\fthe experimental and theoretical uncertainties over the complete ETjet range studied. In\nparticular, no significant deviation is observed in the highest ETjet region. The NLO calculations also give a good description of the scaled jet invariant cross sections as a function\nof xT , as shown in Fig. 2.\n\n9.2\n\nTest of scaling\n\nTo test the scaling hypothesis, the ratio of the scaled jet invariant cross sections as a\nfunction of xT was measured for the two chosen values of hW\u03b3p i, after correcting for the\ndifference in the photon flux [34] between these intervals. Figure 3 and Table 2 show the\nmeasured ratio as a function of xT . It shows a clear deviation from unity, in agreement\nwith the NLO QCD predictions, which include the running of \u03b1s and the evolution of\nthe PDFs with the scale. This constitutes the first observation of scaling violations in \u03b3p\ninteractions.\nThe ratio of the scaled jet invariant cross sections can be used to test QCD more precisely\nthan is possible with the individual cross sections, since the experimental and theoretical\nuncertainties partially cancel. In particular, the experimental uncertainty in the absolute\nenergy scale of the jets cancels almost completely in the ratio. The theoretical uncertainty\non the predictions of the scaled jet invariant cross section was 13%, whereas that on\nthe ratio was reduced to 2 \u2212 5%. The NLO QCD prediction is in agreement with the\ndata within the improved experimental (below 12%) and theoretical uncertainties. This\nagreement shows that the energy-scale dependence predicted by QCD is in accord with\nthe measured dependence.\n\n9.3\n\nDetermination of \u03b1s (MZ )\n\nThe measured cross-section d\u03c3/dETjet as a function of ETjet was used to determine \u03b1s (MZ )\nusing the method presented previously [35]. The NLO QCD calculations were performed\nusing the three MRST99 sets of proton PDFs, central, MRST99\u2193\u2193 and MRST99\u2191\u2191; the\nvalue of \u03b1s (MZ ) used in each partonic cross-section calculation was that associated with\nthe corresponding set of PDFs. The \u03b1s (MZ ) dependence of the predicted d\u03c3/dETjet in\neach bin i of ETjet was parameterised according to\nh\ni\njet\nd\u03c3/dET (\u03b1s (MZ )) = C1i \u03b1s (MZ ) + C2i \u03b1s2 (MZ ),\ni\n\nC1i\n\nC2i\n\nwhere\nand\nare constants, by using the NLO QCD calculations corrected for hadronisation effects. Finally, a value of \u03b1s (MZ ) was determined in each bin of the measured\ncross section as well as from all the data points by a \u03c72 fit.\n\n8\n\n\fThe uncertainties on the extracted values of \u03b1s (MZ ) due to the experimental systematic\nuncertainties were evaluated by repeating the analysis for each systematic check presented\nin Section 7. The largest contribution to the experimental uncertainty comes from the jet\nenergy scale and amounts to \u00b11.5% on \u03b1s (MZ ). The theoretical uncertainties were evaluated as described in Section 8. The largest contribution was the theoretical uncertainty\non \u03b1s (MZ ) arising from terms beyond NLO, which was +4.2\n\u22123.3 %. The change of \u03b1s (MZ )\ndue to the uncertainties on the photon PDFs and on the hadronisation corrections were\n+0.7% and +0.8%, respectively. The uncertainty on \u03b1s (MZ ) due to the uncertainties on\nthe proton PDFs was \u00b10.9%. The total theoretical uncertainty on \u03b1s (MZ ) was obtained\nby adding these uncertainties in quadrature.\nThe values of \u03b1s (MZ ) as determined from the measured d\u03c3/dETjet in each region of ETjet\nare shown in Fig. 4a) and Table 3. By combining all the ETjet regions, the value of \u03b1s (MZ )\nobtained is\n\u03b1s (MZ ) = 0.1224 \u00b1 0.0001 (stat.)\n\n+0.0022\n\u22120.0019\n\n(exp.)\n\n+0.0054\n\u22120.0042\n\n(th.).\n\nThis value of \u03b1s (MZ ) is consistent with the current world average [33] of 0.1183 \u00b1 0.0027\nas well as with recent determinations from jet production in NC DIS at HERA [36, 35]\nand pp\u0304 collisions at Tevatron [37]. It has a precision comparable to the values obtained\nfrom e+ e\u2212 interactions [33].\n\n9.4\n\nEnergy-scale dependence of \u03b1s\n\nThe QCD prediction for the energy-scale dependence of the strong coupling constant\nwas tested by determining \u03b1s from the measured d\u03c3/dETjet at different ETjet values. The\nmethod employed was the same as described above, but parameterising the \u03b1s dependence\nof d\u03c3/dETjet in terms of \u03b1s (hETjet i) instead of \u03b1s (MZ ), where hETjet i is the weighted mean\nof ETjet in each bin. The measured \u03b1s (ETjet ) values are shown in Fig. 4b) and Table 3. The\nresults are in good agreement with the predicted running of the strong coupling constant\nover a large range in ETjet .\nThe energy-scale dependence of the measured \u03b1s (ETjet ) was quantified by fitting the results\nusing the functional form predicted by the renormalisation group equation. Perturbative\nQCD predicts that \u03b1s\u22121 (ETjet ) varies approximately linearly with ln ETjet . At two loops, the\nenergy-scale dependence of \u03b1s\u22121 (ETjet ) is given by\n#\u22121\n\"\njet\n\u03b2\nln(2\nln(E\n/\u039b))\n\u03b2\n1\n0\nT\nln(ETjet /\u039b) * 1 \u2212 2\n,\n(1)\n\u03b1s\u22121 (ETjet ) =\n2\u03c0\n\u03b20 ln(ETjet /\u039b)\nn and nf is the number of active flavours. Thus, the\nwhere \u03b20 = 11 \u2212 32 nf , \u03b21 = 51 \u2212 19\n3 f\njet\n\u22121\nslope of \u03b1s (ET ) gives \u03b20 /2\u03c0. A \u03c72 fit to the extracted \u03b1s\u22121 (ETjet ) values was performed\n9\n\n\fto determine \u03b20 using the functional form given by Eq. (1), leaving \u03b20 and \u039b as free\nparameters; \u03b21 was set to (19\u03b20 \u2212 107)/2. Figure 4c) shows the measured \u03b1s\u22121 (ETjet )\nas a function of ln ETjet together with the results of the fit. Although the value of \u039b,\n+0.506\n0.535 \u00b1 0.073 (stat.) +0.140\n\u22120.126 (exp.) \u22120.233 (th.) GeV, is not well constrained in the fit,\nthe value of \u03b1s (MZ ) obtained by extrapolation from the results of the fit is more precise,\n+0.0069\n\u03b1s (MZ ) = 0.1188 \u00b10.0009 (stat.) +0.0043\n\u22120.0039 (exp.) \u22120.0067 (th.). This determination of \u03b1s (MZ )\nis consistent with that of Section 9.3, in which the running of \u03b1s as predicted by QCD\nwas assumed. The extracted value of \u03b20 is\n\u03b20 = 8.53 \u00b1 0.22 (stat.)\n\n+0.56\n\u22120.53\n\n(exp.)\n\n+1.34\n\u22120.82\n\n(th.).\n\nThis value is consistent with the prediction of perturbative QCD for the relevant number\nof active flavours in the ETjet region considered, \u03b20 = 7.67 for nf = 5.\n\n10\n\nSummary and conclusions\n\nMeasurements of differential cross sections for inclusive jet photoproduction have been\nmade in ep collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 318 GeV using 82.2 pb1 of data\ncollected with the ZEUS detector at HERA. The cross sections refer to jets identified\nwith the longitudinally invariant kT cluster algorithm in the inclusive mode and selected\nwith ETjet > 17 GeV and \u22121 < \u03b7 jet < 2.5. The measurements were made in the kinematic\nregion defined by Q2 \u2264 1 GeV2 and 142 < W\u03b3p < 293 GeV.\n\nThe inclusive jet cross section was measured as a function of ETjet in the range between\njet\n17 and 95 GeV. The scaled jet invariant cross sections, averaged over \u22122 < \u03b7\u03b3p\n< 0, were\nmeasured as a function of the dimensionless variable xT for hW\u03b3p i = 180 and 255 GeV.\nThe NLO QCD calculations give a good description of the shape and magnitude of the\nmeasured cross sections. No significant deviation with respect to QCD was observed up\nto the highest scale studied. The ratio of scaled jet invariant cross sections at two values\nof hW\u03b3p i represents the first observation of scaling violations in \u03b3p interactions.\nA QCD analysis of the measured d\u03c3/dETjet yields a value of the strong coupling constant\nof\n\u03b1s (MZ ) = 0.1224 \u00b1 0.0001 (stat.)\n\n+0.0022\n\u22120.0019\n\n(exp.)\n\n+0.0054\n\u22120.0042\n\n(th.),\n\nwhich is in agreement with the current world average and constitutes the first determination of \u03b1s (MZ ) from jet production in \u03b3p interactions. The value of \u03b1s as a function of\nETjet is in good agreement, over a wide range of ETjet , with the running of \u03b1s as predicted\nby QCD.\n\n10\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nWe thank the DESY Directorate for their strong support and encouragement.
