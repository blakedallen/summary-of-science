The present results imply that a two-dimensional soliton model is required for adequate\ninterpretation of DW motions in the linear- and oscillatory-DW-motion regimes as well as in the\nbeyond-velocity-breakdown regime.\n\n1\n\n\fMagnetic field-driven magnetization (M) reversals in bulk or thin-film magnetic materials via\ndomain-wall (DW) movements as well as coherent or incoherent M rotation have been historically\nlongstanding issues in the research field of magnetism.1 The motion of a head-to-head (or tail-totail) DW in magnetic thin-film nanostripes under applied magnetic fields and/or spin-polarized\ncurrent, the subject of cutting edge research,2-10 has very promising potential applications to new\nclasses of race-track memory11 and logic12 devices. When a static field, H, is applied to a DW, its\nvelocity increases with increasing H in a low-H region, but remarkably drops above a certain\ncritical field known as the Walker field, Hw.2-4,13-15 From earlier studies16, 17 it is known that in the\nlow-H region a single transverse wall (TW) moves steadily along the nanostripe parallel to the field\ndirection. The velocity breakdown is known to be associated with the oscillations of the internal\nstructure of a single moving DW between the TW and the vortex or antivortex wall (VW or\nAVW)16 with the time period of T = 2\u03c0 / \u03b3H ,17 where \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio. In the velocitybreakdown region, V or AV within the VW or AVW exhibits a non-linear gyrotropic motion in the\nnanostripe, resulting in the reduced average DW velocity due to the V or AV motion against the M\nreversal direction (backward or toward the H direction). In a much-higher-field region beyond the\nvelocity-breakdown regime, on the contrary the average DW velocity has been typically observed\nto again increase with a further increase of the applied field.4,16 The physical origin and detailed\nunderstanding of this unexpected behavior remains elusive, whereas the linear and oscillatory DW\ndynamics have been described by one-dimensional (1D) models13,18 and a 2D dynamic soliton\nmodel.16,17 The dynamic origin of the increased DW velocities in the higher-H region beyond the\nDW oscillatory regime is as yet unknown.\n\n2\n\n\fIn this article, we report on the underlying mechanism of M reversal dynamics in soft magnetic\nthin-film nanostripes beyond the velocity-breakdown regime, which occurs via the serial processes\nof the nucleation, gyrotropic motion, and annihilation of V-AV pairs, while maintaining the\nconservation of their total topological charge in the nanostripes. The present results offer a new and\ndeeper physical insight in V-AV-mediated M reversal dynamics in nanostripes beyond the velocitybreakdown regime. We confirm that a 2D dynamic soliton model proposed in our earlier work16,17\nis necessary for an adequate physical description of M reversal dynamics, covering all the different\nfield regimes of DW motions in nanostripes.\nIn the present micromagnetic simulations, we used a rectangular-shaped soft magnetic\nnanostripe (made of Permalloy, Py) of 10 nm thickness (L), 6 \u03bcm length, and different width, w =\n140, 240 and, 400 nm. The simulation procedure and details were reported in Ref. 16. The initial\nDW type used in this study was a head-to-head TW having non-zero average transverse M as the\nground state at zero field in the given nanostripe [Fig. 1(a)]. This DW was driven by a static\nmagnetic field of varying strength applied along the long axis of the nanostripes (in the + x\ndirection).\nThe M reversal dynamics for w = 140 nm and with three different fields, H = 5, 25, and 150 Oe,\nare represented by the displacements of DW versus time (D-vs-t) curves shown in Fig. 1(b). Each of\nthe three different field strengths was selected from each of the represented three distinct H regions,\nnoted as H < HW , HW < H < H mult , and H > H mult , hereafter simply noted as Regions I, II, and\nIII, as reported in Ref. 16. H mult is the field by which the oscillatory DW dynamics above HW are\ndistinguished from the region where a multi-V-AV state appears during the M reversal. In this\ngeometry, HW and H mult were determined to be approximately 10 and 90 Oe, respectively. Those\n\n3\n\n\fcharacteristic D-vs-t curves indicate that the speeds of the M reversals are quite different. In Region\nIII (H = 150 Oe), that is, well above the velocity-breakdown regime, the M reversal again becomes\nfaster (the average DW velocity \u03c5 =162 m/s) than that in Region II ( \u03c5 = 66 m/s) as well as more or\nless comparable to that in Region I ( \u03c5 = 231 m/s). As another example, the D-vs-t for w =240 nm\nand H = 100 Oe is also shown, indicating that the reduced velocity of DW motions in Region II is\nmarkedly increased in Region III. This reflects the fact that the underlying reversal mechanisms in\nthe individual field regions are quite distinct. For the details of other regions I and II, see Refs. 16,\n17.\nTo understand the exact M reversal mechanism in Region III, the serial snapshot images shown in\nFig 2(a) were taken at the indicated times to represent the temporal evolution of the head-to-head\nDW for w = 140 nm and with H = 150 Oe. The similar images shown in Fig 2(b) for w = 240 nm\nand with H = 100 Oe illustrate a different reversal mechanism, as will be discussed below. Unlike\nthe motions in Regions I and II,16,17 the DW motion in Region III is neither a steady motion of a\nTW nor a periodic oscillation of the internal structure of a single moving DW between its different\ntypes (TW, VW, or AVW). Rather, the internal structure of the moving DW contains several\nmagnetic topological solitons16,17 such as Vs and AVs whose cores are seen as black or white spots\naccording to the M orientation of their cores (polarization, p ; p = +1(-1) for the up-(down-)core\norientation. Those serial snapshot images display the individual steps associated with the V-AVmediated dynamic processes. To elucidate the characteristic dynamic features of the nucleation,\ngyrotropic motion, and annihilation of the V-AV pairs, in Fig 3 we presented a schematic\nillustration and the trajectories of the cores of Vs and AVs during their gyrotropic motions in the\nplane of a given nanostripe.\n\n4\n\n\fCase I, shown in Fig. 3(a), illustrates that the V and AV with the same up-core orientation\nnucleate (1) at the opposite edges of the nanostripe at nearly the same time. Then, both the V and\nAV move inward the nanostripe, become closed (2), according to their own non-linear gyrotropic\nmotions, and then finally collapse (3) inside the nanostripe and annihilate [see their core\ntrajectories (right panel)]. Immediately after the V-AV annihilation process, strong spin waves are\nemitted (3) according to the mechanism reported earlier.19 For convenience, hereafter, we denote\nVs and AVs by the symbols V and V , respectively, and their core polarizations by the arrows \u2191\nand \u2193 in the symbols' subscripts, respectively. On the other hand, case II, for w = 240 nm and H =\n100 Oe,20 is shown in Fig. 3(b), where V\u2191 and V\u2191 simultaneously nucleate (1) at the opposite\nedges as in case I. However, unlike case I, the V\u2191 moves (2) inward faster than V\u2191 , while the V\u2191\nis maintained near the same stripe edge. As the next step, the V\u2191 moves further inward, and around\nit an additional V\u2193\u2032 - V\u2193\u2032 pair with p = -1 is nucleated (3). The prime in the superscripts is used to\ndistinguish the newly nucleated V-AV pair from the V-AV pair ( V\u2191 - V\u2191 ) nucleated earlier at both\nnanostripe edges. Then, the V\u2191 \u2212 V\u2193\u2032 pair annihilation process is followed (4) according to the\nmechanism reported in Refs.16, 21, and is accompanied by spin wave emission by the core\nreversal.19 The remaining new vortex ( V\u2193\u2032 ) with the reversed core polarization moves towards the\nup edge of the nanostripe according to its own gyrotropic motion (5), as illustrated in the\nschematic drawing (middle panel) and serial snapshot images, as well as in the core trajectories\n(right panel) in Fig. 3. Although cases I and II differ in the overall M reversal mechanism, the same\n\n5\n\n\fserial processes of the individual steps of the nucleation, non-linear gyrotropic motions, and\nannihilation of the Vs and AVs commonly apply.\nIn order to gain better physical insight into those common individual processes, it is necessary\nto adopt the V-AV-mediated DW dynamics with regard to the emission, motion, and absorption of\ntopological solitons in the framework of collective dynamic variables \u2013 the soliton core positions.\nThe in-plane M configuration of a single symmetric TW resembles an isosceles triangle with three\napexes [Fig. 1(a), right]. An AV can nucleate only at a single apex, in this case, placed at the down\nstripe edge, and a V can nucleate at one of the double apexes at the upper edge, so that the three\napexes can act as the nucleation sites for the magnetic solitons. This is so, because the M\nconfiguration of the moving TW can be represented by magnetic solitons of half-integer topological\ncharges q located on the stripe edges, as shown in the right of Fig. 1(a). A similar approach was\ndeveloped to explain the oscillatory transformation of the internal structure of the different-type\nDWs in the nanostripes within the velocity-breakdown regime.16 In Region II, oscillatory DW\nmotions are associated with the transformation of the internal structure of a single moving DW\nbetween a TW and a V or an AV .\nIn the higher-field Region III, however, both V and AV simultaneously nucleated at the\nopposite edges, as seen in Fig. 3. Such nucleations, compared with that of a single V or AV in\nRegion II, lead to the increase of the exchange energy due to the presence of additional soliton\ncores. These events occur owing to a remarkable reduction of the Zeeman energy by a further\nincrease of H, resulting in the excess exchange energy, due to the increased number of the soliton\ncores inside the nanostripe, being compensated. For the cases of further increases of w and/or H, the\nnumber of the nucleated V-AV pairs was observed to be increased. This M reversal is much faster\n\n6\n\n\fthan those via a single V or AV motion or a single V-AV pair mediated DW motion. Consequently,\nthe reason for the increased DW velocities in the beyond-velocity-breakdown regime is because VAV-pair nucleation is the dominant reversal process in such high-H region. In such V-AV-mediated\n\nM dynamics, the total topological charge of all magnetic solitons (indexed by j) inside the\nnanostripe should be maintained constant, i.e.,\n\n\u2211\n\nj\n\nq j = const . For the case of this nanostripe\n\ngeometry, the constant value is zero because the TW initially has half integer charges, q = +1/2 and\n-1/2 at the opposite edges. The V and AV also bear an integer topological charge, q = 1 and q = -1,\nrespectively.17\nNext, to understand the observed complex trajectories of the coupled V and AV motions\nshown on the right side of Fig. 3, it is necessary to introduce the gyrovector, G = \u2212Gpqz\u02c6 ,22 where\n\n\u1e91 is the unit vector perpendicular to the stripe plane. Since G = 2\u03c0M s L / \u03b3 with M s =| M | is a\npositive constant for the given M distribution,23 the non-zero gyrovector of a soliton results in the\ngyrotropic motion of the soliton center position, X, in a given potential profile W Additionally, the\nmagnetostatic energy plays an important role in forming the potential well (hill) for a single V(AV)\nwith respect to the middle of the nanostripe.16 For the present nanostripe geometry, the sense of the\ngyromotion of a single V or AV is thus determined by the sign of the stiffness coefficient\n\n\u03ba = \u03ba sign(q) of the corresponding W in the transverse direction as well as by the product of pq .\nTherefore, the direction of a single AV or V motion in Region II depends only on the soliton\npolarization p.16,17 However, having considered interactions between V and AV or the same types,\nsuch as interacting Vs and AVs, the potential profile is not simply determined by the sign of q as in\n\n\u03ba = \u03ba sign(q) . For instance, the core trajectories of V\u2191 and V\u2191 in Fig. 3(a), are CCW rotation for\n\n7\n\n\fa certain period of time after their nucleation at stripe edges, but V\u2191 changes its rotation sense to\nCW owing to the attractive interaction between V\u2191 and V\u2191 when they become closed near the\nstripe center. The exchange interaction energy of the two solitons with the charges q1, q2 and the\ncore positions X1 , X 2 can be written as Wint = \u22124\u03c0ALq1 q 2 ln ( X1 \u2212 X 2 / Le ) with Le = 2 A / M s and\nexchange stiffness A, which is relatively small in comparison with the magnetostatic interaction.24\nV and AV attract each other, and the solitons with the same sign of q repel each other,\nindependently of the p and chirality of V and AV (the sense of the in-plane M orientation around its\ncore). A more complex example is shown in Fig. 3(b), where V\u2191 and V\u2193\u2032 seem to follow the\nrotation senses determined by their p's, but their motion directions with respect to the field direction\nare different from the motions in the oscillatory transformation of a single moving DW, as reported\nin Ref. 16. Note that the DW velocity in Region III calculated in Ref. 25 is too small to explain the\nexperimental results.4,8,9 Further studies on the effect of the exchange and magnetostatic interactions\nbetween V and AV on their gyrotropic motions are necessary.\nAccording to the results shown above, we conclude the following. In Region I, the M-reversal\nvelocity is determined by the velocity of a single TW motion, which strongly depends on the\ndamping parameter and the applied field strength, and in Region II, the reversal velocity is\ndetermined by the repeated forward and backward motion of a single V or AV that was nucleated at\nthe stripe edges and transformed from a TW, resulting in the reduced average velocity. Meanwhile,\nin Region III beyond the velocity-breakdown regime, the M-reversal dynamics are a consequence\nof the serial dynamic processes of the nucleation, gyrotropic motion, and annihilation of coupled Vs\nand AVs inside or at the edges of nanostripes, which processes repeatedly take place to complete\n\n8\n\n\fthe M reversal. Thereby, the M-reversal velocity in Region III is determined by the nucleation\nprocess of V-AV pairs, which is the dominant reversal process, followed by the gyrotropic motions\nof the individual V and AV and their annihilation. Such nucleation of V-AV pairs can occur at\nseveral local regions for further increase of H, in order to increase the number of V-AV pairs,\nmaking the M reversal much faster than that in Region II. Nucleation of the coupled V-AV pairs,\ntheir motions, and annihilation play a crucial role in M-reversal dynamics in restricted geometry.\nThe present results reflect the fact that even though 1D models can, albeit incompletely, explain\nlinear and oscillatory DW motions in low- and intermediate-field regions, they cannot adequately\ndescribe the nucleation, gyrotropic motion, and annihilation of V-AV pairs inside nanostripes at\nhigh fields. For adequate physical interpretations of DW motions and transformations of the internal\nDW structure of different-type DWs (TWs, VWs and AVWs) in Regions I and II, as well as of the\nindividual processes of the nucleation, non-linear gyrotropic motion, and annihilation of topological\nmagnetic solitons in soft magnetic thin-film nanostripes, a 2D soliton model should be applied.\n\nThis work was supported by Creative Research Initiatives (ReC-SDSW) of MOST/KOSEF.\n\n9\n\n\fReferences\n\nCorresponding author; sangkoog@snu.ac.kr\n1\n\nA.

(Color online) (a) Left: In-plane M configuration of a TW with the nonzero transverse (+ y\ndirection) M component in nanostripe. The colors denote the local in-plane M, as indicated by the\ncolor wheel. Right: Representation of half-integer topological charges located at both stripe edges,\nalong with the nucleation sites for V (dark yellow dots) and AV (green dot). The streamlines\nindicate the in-plane orientation of the local Ms. (b) DW displacement versus time curves, for DW\nmotions driven by magnetic fields H along long axis of nanostripe of 10 nm thickness, 140 nm\nwidth, and 6 \u03bcm length, as reported in Ref. 16.\n\nFig. 2. (Color online) Serial snapshot images of temporal dynamic evolution of DW motions in a\ngiven nanostripe of w = 140 nm and with H = 150 Oe in (a) and w = 240 nm and H = 100 Oe. in (b).\nThe gray scale and streamlines indicate the normalized out-of-plane M components, as noted by the\ngray bar, and the in-plane M orientation, respectively. The white and black spots indicate the core\npolarization p= +1 and p = -1, respectively, of the Vs and AVs. The positions of the moving DWs at\nindicated times, are noted by numbered images.\n\nFig. 3. (Color online) Snapshot images (left) and schematic illustrations (middle), representing\nnucleation, gyrotoropic motion, and annihilation of Vs and AVs, along with spin-wave radiation, (a)\nand (b) correspond to the dynamic evolutions marked by the red boxes in Fig. 2(a) and 2(b),\nrespectively. Right columns display trajectories of motions of V and AV cores. The different colors\ndenote the different types of vortices, with the indicated core orientations. The arrows nearby the\n\n13\n\n\ftrajectories indicate the directions of the movement of each soliton. The open circles with the\nnumbers on the trajectories describe the core positions at the indicated times noted by the same\nnumbers as those in the plane-view images.\n\nFigures\ny\n\n(a)\n\nz\n\nx\n\nDisplacement (\u03bcm)\n\n\u03c5 = 337 (m/s)\n231 162\n(b) 2.0\n\n66\n\n1.5\nw = 140 (nm),\nH = 5 (Oe)\n140, 25\n\n1.0\n0.5\n0\n\n140, 150\n240, 150\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\nTime (ns)\n\nFig. 1\n\n14\n\n30\n\n\fFig. 2\n\n15\n\n\fFig. 3\n\n16\n\n\f"}
