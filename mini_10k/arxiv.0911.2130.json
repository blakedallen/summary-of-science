Cold atoms trapped in optical lattices\noffer the possibility of studying the time evolution of\nquantum many-body systems with time-dependent system parameters.1 Due to the excellent isolation from the\nenvironment the non-equilibrium dynamics of these systems are accessible with negligible decoherence over long\ntimes.\nNanostructures such as quantum dots provide\nthe framework to examine experimentally the nonequilibrium dynamics in quantum impurity models. Most\nimportantly for the present work, quantum dots can act\nas magnetic impurities displaying Kondo physics.2 In\ncontrast to impurities in a bulk sample, unscreened electrical or magnetic fields can be applied directly such that\nthe local system parameters can be varied in time by\nchoosing appropriate time-dependent fields.3\nThe possibility to experimentally study the properties of interacting many-body systems out of equilibrium\nmotivated numerous analytical and numerical theoretical\ntreatments. Most of the activities have been concentrating on interaction quenches in various model systems.4\u20137\nFor periodically driven interacting many-body systems,\nhowever, less results are known. Recently, periodic timedependent Falicov-Kimball models have been investigated in the limit of infinite dimensions by using dynamical mean-field theory.9 Considerable activity in the\nfield of time-dependent quantum impurity models led\nto a number of works on periodically driven Anderson\nimpurity3,10 and Kondo models11\u201314 .\nAs the Kondo model is the paradigm model for\nstrongly correlated systems, it is of particular interest\nin the field of non-equilibrium phenomena. In equilibrium, the Kondo effect emerges from the interaction of a\nlocalized spin degree of freedom with a bath of surrounding electrons. At sufficiently low temperatures, this bath\nof itinerant electrons develops a localized spin polariza-\n\ntion cloud in the vicinity of the local spin, the so-called\nKondo cloud, providing a mechanism to screen the local\nmagnetic moment. In the zero temperature limit, the\nscreening becomes dominant leading to the emergence\nof a bound state. The surrounding spin polarization\ncloud is tied to the local spin establishing the so-called\nKondo singlet with an associated binding energy TK , the\nKondo temperature. The Kondo effect manifests itself\nmost prominently in the Kondo resonance, a sharp peak\nin the local density of states that is pinned exactly at the\nFermi energy. As the Kondo effect is a coherent manybody phenomenon, the question arises how it is affected\nin a non-equilibrium setting.\nDue to the complexity of many-body systems out of\nequilibrium, it is instructive to investigate those cases\nwhere exact nonperturbative solutions are accessible. In\nthis context, it is of particular interest that the Kondo\nmodel as a paradigm model for strongly correlated systems exhibits a special line in parameter space, the\nToulouse limit, where it becomes exactly solvable.15 The\nToulouse limit displays many generic and universal properties of the strong coupling limit of the Kondo model in\nequilibrium as well as for interaction quenches4 . The local spin dynamics, for example, that is also investigated\nin this work, is well described whereas other universal\nquantities such as the Wilson ratio explicitly depend on\nthe anisotropy.\nThe exact solvability of the Kondo model in the\nToulouse limit is used in this work to investigate nonperturbatively a steady state that is generated by periodically switching on and off the interaction at zero\ntemperature. This steady state is characterized by analyzing exact analytical results for the local dynamical\nquantities, that is the magnetization of the impurity spin,\nthe spin-spin correlation function and the dynamical spin\nsusceptibility.\nA system that is driven by an external force approaches\na steady state if the amount of energy that is provided\nto the system does not lead to an overheating, as it may\nhappen for systems with an unbounded spectrum.

Via the SchriefferWolff transformation, the corresponding Anderson impurity model can be mappedhonto a Kondo model\ni with\n1\n.18 Folan exchange coupling J \u221d \u0393 \u03b5F \u2212\u03b51d \u2212U + \u03b5F \u2212\u03b5\nd\n\nlowing a suggestion by Nordlander and coworkers7 , consider the case where the local single-particle level \u03b5d alternates between two different values \u03b5d1 and \u03b5d2 with\n|\u03b5d2 \u2212 \u03b5F | \u001d |\u03b5d1 \u2212 \u03b5F | where for each \u03b5d1 and \u03b5d2 the\nquantum dot is assumed to be in the Kondo regime.\nThen, the Kondo exchange coupling J2 corresponding to\n\u03b5d2 is much smaller than\n\u221a J1 . The associated Kondo temperature kB TK2 = D \u03c10 J2 e\u22121/(J2 \u03c10 ) , \u03c10 is the density of\nstate at the Fermi level and D a high-energy cutoff, vanishes exponentially such that J2 can be set equal to zero.\nAs a result, the corresponding Kondo model becomes\ntime-dependent with an exchange interaction J1 that is\nswitched on and off periodically. This can be shown rigorously by performing a time-dependent Schrieffer-Wolff\ntransformation.11\u201313\nThe periodic driving in a quantum dot sets an upper bound on the driving frequency \u03a9. As the Kondo\nHamiltonian requires strict single occupancy, the driving has to be small enough not to induce charge fluctuations on the dot caused by hopping processes between\nthe central region and the conduction band by absorbing or emitting quanta of the driving frequency, i.e.,\n\u03a9 \u001c |\u03b5d |, \u03b5d + U .11\u201313\nAt zero temperature in equilibrium, the screening of\nthe local magnetic moment by the conduction-band electrons becomes dominant leading to the emergence of\na bound state called the Kondo singlet. Many universal features of the equilibrium Kondo model in this\nstrong coupling limit are well described by the anisotropic\nKondo Hamiltonian in the Toulouse limit that corresponds to a special line in parameter\n\u221a space of the Hamiltonian in Eq. (1) where Jk = 2\u2212 2. For this value of the\nparallel coupling, the Hamiltonian can be mapped onto\nan exactly solvable quadratic noninteracting resonantlevel model using bosonization and refermionization.16\nRecently, it was shown by Lobaskin and Kehrein4 that\nthese methods can also be adopted to an exact solution\nof an interaction quench scenario. The only difference\nis an additional potential scattering term in the effective\nHamiltonian.\nThe bosonization technique establishes a bosonic representation of fermionic fields \u03a8\u03b1 (x) in one dimension\ncalled the bosonization identity, see Ref.19 for a recent\nreview. In the thermodynamic limit, the bosonization\n\nidentity reduces to:\n1\n\u03a8\u03b1 (x) = \u221a F\u03b1 e\u2212i\u03c6\u03b1 (x) , \u03b1 =\u2191, \u2193,\n(3)\na\nP\nwhere the bosonic field \u03c6\u03b1 (x) = \u2212 q>0 [e\u2212iqx bq\u03b1 +\n\u221a\neiqx b\u2020q\u03b1 ]e\u2212aq/2 / nq is related to the fermionic densities \u03c1\u03b1 (x) = :\u03a8\u2020\u03b1 (x)\u03a8\u03b1 (x): = \u2202x \u03c6\u03b1 (x) and a\u22121 is\nan ultraviolet cutoff. The bosonic operators b\u2020q\u03b1 =\n\u221a P\ni/ nq k c\u2020k+q\u03b1 ck\u03b1 create a superposition of particlehole pairs with momentum transfer q = 2\u03c0nq /L > 0.\nHere, L denotes the system size. The Klein factor F\u03b1 accounts for the annihilation of one electron as this cannot\nbe achieved by the bosonic field \u03c6\u03b1 (x).\nBy performing a sequence of unitary transformations,\nthe Kondo Hamiltonian in the Toulouse limit can be\nsimplified tremendously. First, the spin and charge\n(s, c) degrees of freedom are separated\u221aby defining the\nbosonic fields \u03c6s\u221a\n(x) = [\u03c6\u2191 (x) \u2212 \u03c6\u2193 (x)]/ 2 and \u03c6c (x) =\n[\u03c6\u2191 (x) + \u03c6\u2193 (x)]/ 2. The charge sector of the anisotropic\nKondo Hamiltonian is decoupled from the local spin and\nreduces to a collection of uncoupled harmonic oscillators. Therefore it will be omitted from now on. In\nthe first\u221ahalf period, the interaction part\nin the spin sec\u221a\ntor Jk / 2\u2202x \u03c6s (x)Sz + J\u22a5 /(2a)[F\u2191\u2020 F\u2193 ei 2\u03c6s (0) S\u2212 + h.c.]\nis modified by \u221a\nan Emery-Kivelson transformation U =\nei\u03b3\u03c6s (x)Sz , \u03b3 = 2 \u2212 1, to J\u22a5 /(2a)[F\u2191\u2020 F\u2193 ei\u03c6s (0) S\u2212 + h.c.]\n\u221a\nin the Toulouse limit where Jk = 2 \u2212 2. For the\nsecond half period, the Emery-Kivelson transformation\ngenerates a scattering term \u221d hSz (t)i\u2202x \u03c6s (0), whose\nstrength depends on the instantaneous magnetization of\nthe impurity spin hSz (t)i.4 The exponentials appearing\nin the transformed interaction part can be refermionized by introducing new spinless fermionic fields \u03a8(x) =\na\u22121/2 Fs e\u2212i\u03c6s (x) using the inverse of the bosonization\nidentity where Fs = F\u2193\u2020 F\u2191 .20 One may think of the\n\u03a8\u2020 (x) fields as creating spin excitations at point x in\nthe reservoir. Moreover, another unitary transformation\nU2 = ei\u03c0Ns Sz has to be imposed in order to arrive at a\ncompletely refermionized Hamiltonian and to ensure correct anticommutation relations for all operators.20 Here,\nNs = 12 [N\u2191 \u2212 N\u2193 ] measures the total spin polarization\nof the conduction-band electrons. By defining the operator d = e\u2212i\u03c0[Ns \u2212Sz ] S\u2212 and its Hermitian conjugate d\u2020\nas well as by performing a mode\nR expansion for the new\nfermionic fields ck = (2\u03c0L)\u22121/2 dx\u03a8(x)eikx , one arrives\nat the following Hamiltonian:\nX\nX \u2020\nH=\nk : c\u2020k ck : + g(t)hSz (t)i\n: ck ck0 :\nk\n\ni\nXh \u2020\n+V (t)\nck d + d\u2020 ck\n\nkk0\n\n(4)\n\nk\n\nwhere\nV (t) = V \u03b8(sin(\u03a9t)), V =\np g(t) = g\u03b8(\u2212 sin(\u03a9t)),\n\u221a\nJ\u22a5 \u03c0/2aL, g = (1 \u2212 2)\u03c0/L for t > 0, and g(t) = g,\nV (t) = 0 for t < 0. For times N \u03c4 < t < N \u03c4 + \u03c4 /2\nthe Hamiltonian is a resonant-level model. For times\n\n\f4\nN \u03c4 + \u03c4 /2 < t < N \u03c4 + \u03c4 the dynamics are governed\nby a potential scattering Hamiltonian and the local d\noperators do not evolve in time such that hSz (t)i =\nhSz (N \u03c4 + \u03c4 /2)i. As it will turn out in the following\nanalysis, the intermediate time evolution with the potential scattering Hamiltonian has no influence on the\nlocal spin dynamics such as the magnetization hSz (t)i at\nall. Therefore, it is not necessary to solve the dynamics\nin a self-consistent way.\nThe Kondo scale can be connected to the parameters of\nthe resonant-level model via the impurity contribution to\nthe Sommerfeld coefficient in the specific heat:4 Cimp =\n\u03b3imp T where \u03b3imp = w\u03c0 2 /3TK and w = 0.4128 is the\nWilson number. In this way, the Kondo temperature TK\nis determined by TK = \u03c0w\u2206 where \u2206 = V 2 L/2 is the\nhybridization function.\nThe functional dependence between the spinless\nfermions ck and the conduction-band electrons ck\u03b1 is\nhighly nonlinear and nontrivial. The local spin observable Sz , however, commutes with all unitary transformations and can be connected to operators of the effective\nHamiltonian in a simple way:\n1\nSz = d\u2020 d \u2212 .\n2\n\n(5)\n\nThis relation allows to analytically calculate correlation\nfunctions that involve the Sz observable such as the magnetization of the impurity spin P (t) = hSz (t)i, the spinspin correlation function hSz (t)Sz (t0 )i and the dynamical\nspin susceptibility \u03c700 (t, \u03b5), as it will be done in this work\nfor the periodic driving setup.\n\nwith a unitary matrix G. Despite the complexity of\ntime evolution for time-dependent Hamiltonians, the periodic driving as it is considered in this work involves\ntwo time slices, during which the Hamiltonian is constant. For each half period, the dynamics is determined\nby the Green's functions for a potential scattering G (n)\nand a resonant-level model G. The Green's function for\nthe potential scattering Hamiltonian varies for different\nperiods, as the strength of the scatterer depends on the\ninstantaneous magnetization of the impurity spin. Therefore, the Green's functions are labeled by an additional\nsuperscript where n stands for the number of the period\nafter starting the periodic driving. The time evolution\nover one period transforms the single-particle operators\nin the following way:\n\u0010 \u03c4 \u0011i\nh \u0010\u03c4 \u0011\nMll0 (n)cl0 , Mll0 (n) = G\n,\nG (n)\n2\n2 ll0\nl0\n(7)\ndefining the unitary matrices M(n) that are obtained by\nmatrix multiplication. Note that the order of time evolution in the Heisenberg picture is opposite to the order\nof time evolution in the Schr\u00f6dinger picture: the operators are first evolved according to the potential scattering\nHamiltonian although it acts in the second half period. In\nthis formulation, the problem of long-time evolution reduces to a matrix multiplication problem since the longtime evolution is completely determined by evolving the\nsingle-particle operators over multiple periods:\ncl (\u03c4 ) =\n\nX\n\ncl (N \u03c4 ) =\n\nX\nl0\n\nIII.\n\nTIME EVOLUTION\n\nAs the Hamiltonian in Eq. (4) is quadratic, the time\nevolution of the single-particle operators ck and d is\nentirely determined by the Green's functions Gll0 (t) =\n\u03b8(t)h{cl (t), c\u2020l0 }i:\ncl (t) =\n\nX\n\nGll0 (t)cl0 , l, l0 = k, d\n\n(6)\n\n(N )\n\n(N )\n\nMll0 cl0 , Mll0 = [M(1) . . .

The matrices M(n), however, display nice mathematical properties\nsuch that an analytical calculation can be carried out as\nis shown in Appendix A. The goal is to derive solvable\nrecursion formulas by partially performing summations\nover intermediate indices.

As\na reference, the equilibrium curve for a resonant-level model\nwith the same Kondo temperature TK is included. The parameter \u03b7 = \u03c4 TK = \u03c4 /tK compares the speed of switching \u03c4\nwith the internal time scale tK = 1/TK .\n\nto transform into |l0 i after N periods \u03c4 . Here, |i denotes\nthe true vacuum without any fermion. In Fig. 2, plots\n(\u221e)\nfor |Mdk |2 are shown, that is the probability for a d\nfermion to decay into a k fermion after an infinite number of periods, i.e., as the steady state has developed. For\nlarge periods, the probability distribution approaches its\nequilibrium shape of a resonant-level model whereas for\ndecreasing the period \u03c4 side-peaks appear located at odd\nmultiples of the driving frequency \u03a9. This corresponds\nto hopping processes under the absorption or emission\nof an odd number of quanta \u03a9. Regarding the d\u2020 and\nd operators as raising or lowering the local spin and c\u2020k\nas creating a spin excitation of energy k in the fermionic\nreservoir, one can deduce from Fig. 2 that the elementary excitations caused by the periodic driving are those\nwhere the local spin is flipped by simultaneously creating spin excitations of energy n\u03a9, n odd. A Fourier series\nexpansion of the \u03b8(sin(\u03a9t))-function in the interval [0, \u03c4 ]\nreveals why mostly the odd frequencies contribute:\n\u03b8 [sin(\u03a9t)] = \u2212\n\nX\n\ncos(n\u03a9t).\n\n(10)\n\nn\u22082Z+1\n\nTherefore, the switch on and off driving can be thought\nof as a non-monochromatic driving including all odd multiples of the driving frequency.\nAs an aside, one can deduce from Eq. (9) that the\nperiodic switching only leads to the enhancement of certain fluctuations that are already present in the corresponding equilibrium Hamiltonians. The periodic timedependence of the Hamiltonian leads to a selection of\ncertain transitions that correspond to the absorption or\nemission of an odd number of energy quanta \u03a9.\n\n(11)\n\nitself appears in the Hamiltonian. Therefore, the magnetization provides the full access to the time evolution\nin the present time-dependent setup. As it will turn\nout in the following, this does not imply that the problem has to be solved self-consistently. In contrast, the\ntime evolution of the magnetization is independent of\nthe potential scattering term appearing in the effective\nHamiltonian as already mentioned below Eq. (4). Due to\nEq. (5), the magnetization is connected to the occupation\nnd (t) = hd\u2020 (t)d(t)i of the local d-level:\n1\nP (t) = nd (t) \u2212 .\n2\n\n(12)\n\nAs a consequence of the periodicity of the Hamiltonian,\nit is convenient to represent time coordinates in the following way:\nt = n\u03c4 + s\n\n, n \u2208 N, s \u2208 [0, \u03c4 /2].\n\n(13)\n\nFor s \u2208 [\u03c4 /2, \u03c4 ] the Sz operator is constant due to the\nswitch off of the spin dynamics. Therefore, the formulas\nin the following will always be presented for s \u2208 [0, \u03c4 /2].\nUsing the formulas in Eq. (9) and the fact that the matrices M(N ) are unitary, it can be shown that the magnetization decays exponentially in time:\nP (t) = P (0) e\u2212n\u2206\u03c4 e\u22122\u2206s ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere the time scale is set by the Kondo scale tK =\n1/TK = 1/(\u03c0w\u2206). For a single interaction quench, the\nmagnetization Pqu (t) equals:4,16,21,22\nPqu (t) = P (0) e\u22122\u2206t .\n\n(15)\n\nComparison with the result in Eq. (14) reveals that the\nperiodic driving affects the impurity spin orientation only\nby reducing the total time during which the spin dynamics in the Kondo Hamiltonian is switched on. The initial\nlocal spin polarization is transferred to the conduction\nband and flows away from the central region to infinity. Note that the magnetization is independent of the\nintermediate time evolution generated by the potential\nscattering Hamiltonian.\nIn the limit of fast switching, \u03c4 \u2192 0, the magnetization\ndecays exponentially in time\nP\u03c4 \u21920 (t) = P (0) e\u2212\u2206t .\n\n(16)\n\nThe associated rate \u2206, however, is smaller compared\nto the single quench case where it is equal to 2\u2206, see\n\n\f6\nEq. (15). This is surprising, as one might expect that\nthe additional energy provided to the system by the periodic driving may open additional phase space for relaxation processes. The decrease in the rate by one half occurs simply because the spin dynamics that are the only\nsource of relaxation of the magnetization are switched on\nonly during half of the time.\nThe exact result in Eq. (16) for the magnetization,\nhowever, contrasts the dynamics one obtains by a naive\nimplementation of the Trotter formula. Following a suggestion by Eisler and Peschel23 the dynamics of a periodically quenched system in the limit \u03c4 \u2192 0 is identical to\nthat of an effective equilibrium Hamiltonian that can be\nobtained by applying the Trotter formula24 to the time\nevolution operator U over one period:\nU = e\u2212iH1 \u03c4 /2 e\u2212iH2 \u03c4 /2 \u2248 e\u2212i\n\nH1 +H2\n2\n\n\u03c4\n\n+ O(\u03c4 2 ).\n\n(17)\n\nAs a result, the effective Hamiltonian equals the timeaveraged one, that is a resonant-level model with a hopping amplitude V /2 plus a potential scattering term. The\npotential scattering term, however, does not affect the\nspin dynamics. Therefore, it will be omitted in the following. A resonant-level model with hopping amplitude\nV /2 generates a decay of the magnetization at a rate \u2206/2\nas \u2206 \u221d V 2 , compare Eq. (15), in contrast to the exact\nvalue \u2206.\nFrom a mathematical point of view, the Trotter formula fails as both Hamiltonians H1 and H2 have to be\nself-adjoint in a mathematical sense, that is a stronger\nrequirement than Hermitian. For bounded operators (in\nfact, all realistic models are equipped with a high-energy\ncutoff), self-adjointness is guaranteed, in contrast to unbounded operators as considered in this work. In fact, regarding a resonant-level model with a nontrivial hopping\n2\nelement Vk (t) = V (t) e\u2212(k/kc ) where V (t) = V \u03b8[sin(\u03a9t)]\nand kc a high-energy cutoff, one indeed observes that in\nthe limit \u03c4 \u2192 0 the magnetization converges to the result\nobtained by applying the Trotter formula, see Eq. (17).\nPhysically speaking, the inapplicability of the Trotter\nformula is a consequence of the creation of high-energy\nexcitations in the fast driving limit. The typical excitations generated by the periodic driving are of the order\nof \u03a9 = 2\u03c0/\u03c4 corresponding to the absorption and emission of quanta of the driving frequency, compare Fig. (2).\nAs \u03a9 \u2192 \u221e for \u03c4 \u2192 0, the typical excitations carry high\nenergies. If the system is not provided with a mechanism, such as a finite bandwidth, that suppresses or cuts\noff these high-energy excitations, they will exist in the\nsystem even for \u03c4 \u2192 0. Clearly, such excitations are\nnot present in equilibrium systems leading to the con-\n\nclusion that this fast driven system cannot described by\nan equilibrium Hamiltonian reflecting the mathematical\nstatement above.\nSumming up, the Trotter formula is not applicable in\nthis model with a flat hybridization function. Despite\nthe fact that realistic models actually exhibit a bounded\nspectrum, the results presented in this work describe correctly the dynamics in the limit \u03a9 \u001d TK , provided that\nthe physical cutoff D is still much bigger than \u03a9.\n\nV.\n\nSPIN-SPIN CORRELATION FUNCTION\n\nA dynamical quantity that carries more information\nabout the local properties of the Kondo model is the\nspin-spin correlation function:\ni\nhSz (t)Sz (t0 )i = C(t, t0 ) \u2212 \u03c7(t, t0 ),\n2\n\n(18)\n\nwhere C(t, t0 ) = 21 h{Sz (t), Sz (t0 )}i denotes the symmetrized part and \u03c7(t, t0 ) = i\u03b8(t \u2212 t0 )h[Sz (t), Sz (t0 )]i the\nresponse function for t > t0 . After an infinite number of\nperiods \u03c4 , a steady state develops in which all real-time\ncorrelation functions are invariant under a discrete time\nshift \u03c4 in all their time arguments. For the spin-spin\ncorrelation function this implies\nhSz (t + \u03c4 )Sz (t0 + \u03c4 )i = hSz (t)Sz (t0 )i.\n\n(19)\n\nTherefore, the time coordinate t0 can be restricted to the\ninterval [0, \u03c4 ]. The average h. . .i in the steady state is to\nbe understood as\nhSz (t)Sz (t0 )i = lim h\u03a80 (N \u03c4 )|Sz (t)Sz (t0 )|\u03a80 (N \u03c4 )i,\nN \u2192\u221e\n\n(20)\nwhere |\u03a80 i denotes the initial state. In the steady state\nwhere hSz (t)i = hSz (t0 )i = 0, the spin-spin correlation\nfunction equals\n1\nhSz (t)Sz (t0 )i = hn\u0302d (t)n\u0302d (t0 )i \u2212 .\n4\n\n(21)\n\nUsing the formulas in Eq. (9), the spin-spin correlation\nfunction, that is a four-point function in terms of the\nfermionic operators of the effective Hamiltonian, can be\nrelated to a two-point function:\nhSz (t)Sz (t0 )i = hd\u2020 (t)d(t0 )i2 ,\nwhere\n\n(22)\n\n\f7\n\nhd\u2020 (t)d(t0 )i =\n\n\u0014\n\u0011\n\u0001\u0010\n0\n0\ne\u2212i\u03c9\u2206\u03c4 \u2212\u2206(s+t0 ) 1 \u2212 2 cos(\u03c9\u2206\u03c4 /2)e\u2212\u2206\u03c4 /2 + e\u2212\u2206\u03c4\n+ e\u2212i\u03c9\u2206s \u2212 e\u2212\u2206s ei\u03c9\u2206t \u2212 e\u2212\u2206t\ne\n2\n\u2212\u2206\u03c4\n/2\n\u2212\u2206\u03c4\n1+\u03c9\n1 \u2212 2 cos(\u03c9\u2206\u03c4 )e\n+e\n0\n\u0015\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2212i\u03c9\u2206\u03c4\n/2\n\u2212\u2206\u03c4\n/2\n\u0001 i\u03c9\u2206\u03c4 /2 \u2212 e\u2212\u2206\u03c4 /2\n\u2212e\n\u2212\u2206s\n\u2212i\u03c9\u2206t0\n\u2212\u2206t0 e\n\u2212\u2206t0\ni\u03c9\u2206s\n\u2212\u2206s e\ne\n+e\n\u2212e\n+e\ne\n\u2212e\n.\n(23)\ne\u2212i\u03c9\u2206\u03c4 \u2212 e\u2212\u2206\u03c4 /2\nei\u03c9\u2206\u03c4 \u2212 e\u2212\u2206\u03c4 /2\n\n1\n\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nd\u03c9\n\n0.25\n\nRemarkably, the real part of the hd\u2020 (t)d(t0 )i correlator\ncan be calculated analytically\n(24)\n\nas one can expect by dimensional analysis. As a consequence, the Kondo scale, though an equilibrium quantity, remains the only relevant time and energy scale as\nit was shown for the conductance through a Kondo impurity in the work by Kaminski et al..11,12 The period \u03c4\nonly appears in combination with the Kondo time scale\ntK = 1/TK defining the ratio:\n\u03b7=\n\n\u03c4\n= \u03c4 TK .\ntK\n\n(26)\n\nTherefore, it is only important how fast the system is\ndriven compared to the internal time scale tK .\nThe limit of long switching times: In the limit of large\nperiods \u03c4 , the behavior of the local correlation functions\nis accessible by general arguments. Roughly speaking,\nthe system is able to relax during each half period. Initially, the system is prepared in one of the ground states\n|\u03a80 i of the noninteracting Hamiltonian that are product\nstates of the Fermi sea for the conduction-band electrons\nand a spin wave function for the local level. Switching\n\nC(t)\n\nmatching precisely the result of Langreth and\nNordlander25 who derived a general formula of this\ncorrelator for an arbitrarily time-dependent resonantlevel model.\nInserting the time-dependence of the\nhopping amplitude V (t) of the present setup into their\nresult shows perfect agreement. As the anticommutator\nof two time-evolved fermionic single-particle operators is\nindependent of the state if the Hamiltonian is quadratic,\nthe full information about the influence of the steady\nstate onto the spin-spin correlation function is contained\nin the imaginary part of the hd\u2020 (t)d(t0 )i correlator. The\nimaginary part is not accessible analytically, but can be\nevaluated numerically. A representative plot of C(t, t0 )\nand \u03c7(t, t0 ) is shown in Fig. 3. A detailed discussion will\nbe given below.\nDue to the appearance of a new scale in the present\nperiodic driving setup, the universal description of the\nspin-spin correlation function gets modified in comparison to its equilibrium form:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nt t0 \u03c4\nhSz (t)Sz (t0 )i = F\n,\n,\n,\n(25)\ntK tK tK\n\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n-0.05\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\nt/tK\n\n6\n\n8\n\n0.12\n\u03b7 = 0.13\n\u03b7 = 2.6\n\u03b7 = 6.5\n\u03b7 = 26\n\n0.08\n\u03c7(t)\n\n\b\n0\nh d\u2020 (t), d(t0 ) i = e\u2212n\u2206\u03c4 /2 e\u2212\u2206(s\u2212t )\n\n\u03b7 = 0.13\n\u03b7 = 1.0\n\u03b7 = 1.8\n\u03b7 = 13\n\n0.2\n\n0.04\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\nt/tK\n\n6\n\n8\n\nFIG. 3: Universal curves for the symmetrized correlation\nfunction C(t) = C(t, 0) and the response function \u03c7(t) =\n\u03c7(t, 0) for different values of the driving rate \u03b7 at zero waiting time t0 = 0. The parameter \u03b7 = \u03c4 /tK compares the speed\nof the external driving \u03c4 with the internal Kondo time scale\ntK = 1/TK .\n\non the interaction in the Kondo model creates local excitations in the vicinity of the local spin and the Kondo\nsinglet forms. The excitations generated by the quench\ndelocalize and flow away from the central region to infinity such that they cannot contribute to local properties\nany more. Therefore, the time evolved state looks like\nthe ground state for local observables after a sufficiently\nlong time. As was emphasized in Ref.4 , however, the\nstate |\u03a80 i can never develop into the true ground state\nof the Kondo model as the overlap of both wave func-\n\n\f8\ntions is constant in time. Nevertheless, the time evolved\nstate |\u03a80 i is essentially equivalent to the true ground\nstate as far as expectation values of local observables\nsuch as the Sz operator are concerned. All statements\nabout relaxation of the state itself in the following are\nto be understood in this sense. After half of the period, the interaction in the Kondo model is switched off,\nthereby destroying the Kondo singlet. The excitations\nthat are created by breaking up the Kondo singlet delocalize as argued before and the system evolves into the\nground state of the noninteracting Hamiltonian, that is a\nproduct state of the Fermi sea and a spin wave function\nwith zero magnetization. Therefore, the system at the\nmoment of the second switch on of the interaction is prepared as initially up to a change in the local spin wave\nfunction. As a result, the system behaves as for a single interaction quench, a situation that has already been\naddressed by Lobaskin and Kehrein.4,5 Analytically, the\nspin-spin correlation function transforms into:\n\u0014\n\u03c4 \u2192\u221e 1 \u2212\u2206(t\u2212t0 )\nhSz (t)Sz (t0 )i \u2212\u2192\ne\n\u2212 i (s(t \u2212 t0 )\n2\n\u0011i2\n0\n\u2212e\u2212\u2206t s(t) + e\u2212\u2206t s(t0 )\n, (27)\n\nR\u221e\nwhere s(t) = \u03c0 \u22121 0 d\u03c9 sin(\u03c9\u2206t)/(\u03c9 2 + 1). This result\nmatches precisely the result obtained by Lobaskin and\nKehrein4 for a single interaction quench.\n\nThe limit of fast switching: In the opposite limit\n\u03c4 \u2192 0, there exists no general argument capturing the\ndynamics in the resulting steady state. The sole reason\nfor this is that the Trotter formula is not applicable in\nthis model as explained in Sec. IV. Otherwise, the dynamics in the steady state would be governed by an effective equilibrium Hamiltonian. Nevertheless, the fast\ndriving generates dynamics similar to equilibrium as the\nsystem is not able to follow the fast externally prescribed\nperturbation.\nPerforming the limit \u03c4 \u2192 0, the spin-spin correlation\nfunction reduces to:\n\u0014\n\u00152\n1\n\u03c4 \u21920 1 \u2212\u2206(t\u2212t0 )/2\n0\n0\ne\n\u2212 i s((t \u2212 t )/2) .\nhSz (t)Sz (t )i \u2212\u2192\n2\n2\n(28)\nThus, it only depends on the time difference signaling\nthe similarity to an equilibrium problem in the sense\nthat time-translational invariance is restored. The equilibrium spin-spin correlation function equals:4\n\u0014\n\u00152\n1 \u2212\u2206(t\u2212t0 )\n0\n0\nhSz (t)Sz (t )ieq =\ne\n\u2212 is(t \u2212 t ) .\n(29)\n2\nComparing the result of Eq. (28) with the equilibrium\ncase, one first observes that the time argument is scaled\nby a factor of 1/2. As for the magnetization, this can\nbe understood by the fact that the spin operators evolve\nnontrivially only during half of the time. Additionally, a\nprefactor of 1/2 appears in front of the function s such\n\nthat the real and imaginary part of the hd\u2020 (t)d(t0 )i correlator transform qualitatively different in the limit \u03c4 \u2192 0.\nThus, the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, a signature of\nequilibrium systems, is violated. This then leads to the\nconclusion that it is impossible to find an equilibrium\nHamiltonian generating the same dynamics.\nNevertheless, other quantities such as the dynamical\nspin susceptibility, as it will be shown in Sec. VI, can be\nrelated to equilibrium Hamiltonians. The inapplicability\nof the Trotter formula does not exclude the possibility to\nfind equilibrium behavior, it only excludes the possibility\nto find a unique equilibrium Hamiltonian describing the\ncorrect dynamics for all observables. Concluding, the\nsteady state in the limit \u03c4 \u2192 0 provides an example\nfor the emergence of new quantum states similar to\nequilibrium states but with new properties that are not\naccessible by equilibrium thermodynamics.\nThe asymptotic long-time behavior: In equilibrium, the\nspin-spin correlation function exhibits a characteristic algebraic long-time behavior at zero temperature:\n\u0014\n\u00152\ntK\nt\u2212t0 \u2192\u221e\nhSz (t)Sz (t0 )ieq \u2212\u2192 \u2212w2\n.\n(30)\nt \u2212 t0\nAt finite temperatures, the decay is exponential due to\nthe smearing of the Fermi surface. Therefore, the longtime behavior of the spin-spin correlation function can\nserve as a measure whether the excitations that are created by the periodic driving are equivalent to those induced by a finite temperature. In this case, the steady\nstate may be characterized by relating it to an equilibrium system at an effective temperature, a concept that\nhas been widely used recently.3,5,7,8\nIn the present periodic time-dependent setup, the\nasymptotic long-time behavior of the spin-spin correlation function can be determined analytically:\n\u00152\n\u0014\ntK\nt\u2212t0 \u2192\u221e\n0\n2\nhSz (t)Sz (t )i \u2212\u2192 \u2212w\n.\n(31)\nt \u2212 t0\nSurprisingly, the long-time behavior of the spin-spin correlation function is universal in the sense that it is completely independent of the external driving. Moreover, it\nprecisely matches the equilibrium behavior at zero temperature. As the algebraic decay in equilibrium is caused\nby the sharp Fermi surface at zero temperature, one can\nconclude that the periodic driving is not able to smear\nthe Fermi surface or to at least locally heat up the system\nexcluding the concept of effective temperature. Furthermore, the low-energy excitations in the immediate vicinity of the Fermi level that are relevant for the long-time\nbehavior are unaffected by the periodic driving. The excitation spectrum involves excitations of multiples of the\ndriving frequency that emerge from processes where the\nlocal spin is flipped by simultaneously creating collective\nspin excitations in the fermionic reservoir with energies\nof odd multiples of the driving frequency \u03a9, as can be\nseen in Fig. 2. Therefore, the excitation spectrum is of\n\n\f9\ndiscrete character, in contrast to the excitation spectrum\ninduced by temperature.\nVI.\n\nDYNAMICAL SPIN SUSCEPTIBILITY\n\nIn the steady state, the magnetization of the impurity\nspin vanishes due to Eq. (14). A local spin polarization\ncan be induced by applying a magnetic field to the local\nspin. In the linear response regime one obtains:\nZ \u221e\ndt0 \u03c7(t, t0 )h(t0 ).\n(32)\nhSz (t)ih = hSz (t)i +\n\u2212\u221e\n\nExpectation values without an index h are to be evaluated with respect to the unperturbed Hamiltonian. In\nthe steady state, the magnetization vanishes such that\nthe expectation value for the local spin polarization is\nsolely determined by the response function\n\u03c7(t, t0 ) = i\u03b8(t \u2212 t0 )h[Sz (t), Sz (t0 )]i.\n\n(33)\n\nIn equilibrium, the response function \u03c7(t, t0 ) only depends on the time difference thereby establishing a spectral representation of only one frequency argument whose\nimaginary part \u03c700 (\u000f) is called the dynamical spin susceptibility. It shows a peak located near the Kondo temperature TK that can be associated with the Kondo singlet.\nThe existence of such a peak in a non-equilibrium setting can also be interpreted as a signature for the presence of the Kondo effect as a whole, as the Kondo singlet is just one manifestation of this coherent many-body\nphenomenon. Moreover, in equilibrium, the fluctuationdissipation theorem holds that connects the dynamical\nspin susceptibility with the local spin fluctuation spectrum. In systems out of equilibrium, the FluctuationDissipation theorem is violated, as can be seen explicitly for a single interaction quench scenario in the Kondo\nmodel.5\nFor periodic time-dependent Hamiltonians there also\nexists a preferable spectral decomposition. Due to the\nperiodicity property in Eq. (19), it is suitable to define\ntwo new time arguments:\nt + t0\n, trel = t \u2212 t0 .\n(34)\n2\nExpressing \u03c7(t, t0 ) in these coordinates, \u03c7(tav , trel ) is invariant under the transformation tav \u2192 tav + \u03c4 such that\na Fourier series expansion in the coordinate tav can be\nperformed. Therefore, one can spectrally decompose \u03c7\nin the following way that is usually referred to as the\nWigner representation:\ntav =\n\n\u03c7n (\u03b5) =\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\nZ\n1 \u03c4\ntrel\ntrel\nin\u03a9tav\ni\u03b5trel\n=\ndtav e\ndtrel e\n\u03c7 tav +\n, tav \u2212\n\u03c4 0\n2\n2\nZ \u03c4\nZ\n1\n=\ndtav ein\u03a9tav dtrel ei\u03b5trel \u03c7 (tav + trel , tav )\n\u03c4 0\nZ\n1 \u03c4\n=\ndtav ein\u03a9tav \u03c7(tav , \u03b5)\n(35)\n\u03c4 0\n\nwhere \u03b5 = \u03b5 + n\u03a9/2. With each component n, one can\nassociate the behavior of the quantity \u03c7 due to processes\nwhere n quanta of the driving frequency \u03a9 are absorbed\n(n > 0) or emitted (n < 0). The quantity \u03c7(tav , \u03b5) can be\ninterpreted as the spectral decomposition of \u03c7 at a given\npoint tav in time. The n = 0 component of \u03c7n simply is\nthe time average of the quantity \u03c7(tav , \u03b5).\nApplying a small sinusoidal magnetic field h(t) =\nh0 sin(\u03a90 t) to the local spin in the steady state, linear\nresponse theory predicts for the magnetization of the impurity spin hSz (t)ih in the presence of the small perturbation h:\nX\nhSz (t)ih = h0\n[\u03c70n (\u03a90 + n\u03a9/2) sin[(\u03a90 + n\u03a9)t]\nn\n\n\u2212\u03c700n (\u03a90 + n\u03a9/2) cos[(\u03a90 + n\u03a9)t]] . (36)\n\nRemarkably, this expression contains a static contribution if \u03a90 = m\u03a9, m \u2208 Z\\{0}. Therefore, it is possible to\nalign the local spin on average by applying a sinusoidal\nmagnetic field that itself contains no static contribution:\nhSz (t)ih = \u03c700m (m\u03a9/2).\n\n(37)\n\nHere, h. . . i denotes the time average. As the spin dynamics are switched off during the second half period,\nthe external magnetic field is not able to influence the local spin magnetization in this time window regardless of\nits time dependence. Therefore, the magnetic field must\nbe capable of polarizing the local spin during the first\nhalf period in order to induce a static component. This\ncan be achieved by h(t) = h0 sin(\u03a90 t) with \u03a90 = m\u03a9.\nNote that a definite order of taking limits is implicitly\nprescribed in this linear response calculation. First, the\nsystem is evolved into the steady state that is established\nafter an infinite number of periods. Afterwards, an additional sinusoidal magnetic field is applied that acts for\nan eventually infinite amount of time. Therefore, linear\nresponse theory only provides the information of how\nan additional infinitesimal magnetic field influences the\nlocal spin properties after the steady state has already\nbeen established. It does not necessarily describe the\nproperties of a system whose interaction is periodically\nswitched on and off in presence of a magnetic field,\nas the two involved limiting processes may not commute.\nResults for \u03c700 (tav , \u03b5): In Fig. 4, results for the dynamical spin susceptibility \u03c700 (tav , \u03b5) are shown for different\nvalues of the driving frequency \u03a9. The first plot displays the case of slow driving, i.e., \u03c4 \u001d tK , and reveals\nagain the single quench dynamics as argued before. After\na transient regime on a time scale tK , that is the time\nscale for the buildup of the Kondo effect7 , the dynamical spin susceptibility approaches its equilibrium shape\nwith a peak located at \u03b5 \u2248 TK representing the buildup\nof the Kondo singlet and therefore of the Kondo effect.\nNear the half period boundary, however, a new structure emerges. At tav \u2248 \u03c4 /2 \u2212 tK , a whole sequence of\nstrong peaks appears that cannot be explained by the\n\n\f10\n\u03b7 = 31\n\n3\n\n\u03c7\u2032\u2032 (tav , \u03b5) \u00d7 TK\n\n4\n3.5\n3\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n-0.5\n\n2.5\n\n\u03b5/TK\n\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n0\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9\ntav /\u03c4\n\u03b7 = 1.3\n\n3\n\n1\n\n\u03c7\u2032\u2032 (tav , \u03b5) \u00d7 TK\n\n0.35\n0.3\n\n2.5\n\n0.25\n\u03b5/TK\n\n2\n\n0.2\n\n1.5\n\n0.15\n0.1\n\n1\n\n0.05\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-0.05\n0\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9\ntav /\u03c4\n\u03b7 = 0.13\n\n3\n\n1\n\n\u03c7\u2032\u2032 (tav , \u03b5) \u00d7 TK\n\n0.3\n\n2.5\n\n0.25\n\n\u03b5/TK\n\n2\n\n0.2\n\n1.5\n\n0.15\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n0.5\n\n0.05\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9\ntav /\u03c4\n\n1\n\nFIG. 4: False color plots of the dynamical susceptibility\n\u03c700 (tav , \u03b5) at a given point tav in time for different values of\nthe parameter \u03b7. The upper plot shows the behavior for slow\ndriving consistent with a single interaction quench picture.\nThe lower plot displays the fast driving behavior that is similar to an equilibrium problem. The plot in the middle shows\nthe intermediate regime of competing time scales.\n\nsimple single interaction quench picture as this coherent phenomenon is solely caused by the periodic driving.\nApproaching tav = \u03c4 these peaks rapidly decrease and\ndisappear. Note, that the dynamical spin susceptibility\nis not discontinuous at tav = \u03c4 /2 as it might seem. The\ncollapse near \u03c4 /2, however, is so fast that it cannot be\nresolved by the pictures presented here.\nIn the case of fast switching, the lower plot in Fig. 4,\nthe dynamical spin susceptibility stays nearly constant\n\nover the whole period. The system is not able to adapt\nto the fast external perturbation, as it is faster than the\ninternal time scale tK , on which the system is able to\nreact. Remarkably, the shape of the spectral decomposition at any time point tav resembles the shape of an\nequilibrium dynamical spin susceptibility with a reduced\nKondo temperature TK /2. It was shown in Eq. (28) that\nthe response function \u03c7\u03c4 \u21920 (t, TK ) in the limit \u03c4 \u2192 0\nis identical to half of an equilibrium response function\n\u03c7eq (t/2, TK )/2 at a rescaled time argument t/2 and identical Kondo temperature TK . Here, the Kondo temperature has been included explicitly for convenience. Such\na relation for functions in time implies the following relation for the corresponding Fourier transforms:\n\u03c7\u03c4 \u21920 (\u03b5, TK ) = \u03c7eq (2\u03b5, TK ).\n\n(38)\n\nFor the dynamical spin susceptibility, this statement can\nbe rewritten in terms of a modified Kondo temperature:\n\u03c700\u03c4 \u21920 (\u03b5, TK ) = 2\u03c700eq (\u03b5, TK /2).\n\n(39)\n\nThe equilibrium dynamical susceptibility at zero temperature is known exactly, such that16,26\n\"\n\u0012 \u00132 !\n2\n\u2206\n2\u03b5\n1\n1\n\u03c700\u03c4 \u21920 (\u03b5) =\nln 1 +\n2\u03c0 \u03b52 + \u22062 2\u03b5\n\u2206\n\u0012 \u0013\u0015\n1\n2\u03b5\n+ arctan\n.

Therefore, one\ncan speculate that the Kondo effect itself survives with a\nrescaled Kondo temperature TK /2.27 Although this analogy suggests the equivalence to an effective equilibrium\nproblem, this is not valid in a strict sense, since it was\nshown, compare Eq. (28), that one cannot find an effective equilibrium Hamiltonian that generates the same\ndynamics. Nevertheless, it is remarkable that the dynamical spin susceptibility, that is a measurable quantity in\nprinciple, shows an equilibrium-like behavior of a Kondo\nmodel with reduced Kondo temperature in this limit.\nThe robustness of the Kondo effect even for \u03a9 \u001d TK\nhas also been observed by Nordlander and coworkers3\nwhere the time-averaged local spectral density shows a\nKondo resonance in the limit \u03a9 \u001d TK .\nThe plot in the middle of Fig. 4 shows the intermediate regime where both the external time scale \u03c4 and\nthe internal time scale tK are of the same order. In\nthis case, the system is able to adapt partially to the\nexternally prescribed perturbation. For small times\ntav , one observes that the Kondo singlet tries to form,\nthe dynamical spin susceptibility tends to approach its\nequilibrium profile. Near the half period boundary where\nthe interaction is switched off, however, the dynamical\nspin susceptibility collapses onto a curve with a peak located approximately at TK /2 as in the fast driving case.\n\n\f11\n0.25\n\u03b7 = 1.3\n\u03b7 = 6.5\n\u03b7 = 13\n\u03b7 = 26\n\u03b7 = 65\n\n\u03c7\u0001\u00010 (\u03b5) \u00d7 TK\n\n0.2\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n0.001\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\u03b5/TK\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0.05\n0\n\n\u03c700n (\u03b5) = \u2212\u03c700\u2212n (\u2212\u03b5),\n\n\u03c7\u0001\u00011 (\u03b5) \u00d7 TK\n\n-0.05\n-0.1\n-0.15\n\u03b7 = 1.3\n\u03b7 = 6.5\n\u03b7 = 26\n\u03b7 = 65\n\n-0.2\n-0.25\n-0.3\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n(\u03b5 \u2212 \u03a9/2)/\u03a9\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n-2\n\n0\n(\u03b5 \u2212 \u03a9)/\u03a9\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n0.2\n\u03b7 = 1.3\n\u03b7 = 6.5\n\u03b7 = 26\n\u03b7 = 65\n\n0.15\n\n\u03c7\u0001\u00012 (\u03b5) \u00d7 TK\n\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n-0.05\n-0.1\n-0.15\n\ncrease in the binding energy as well as the stability of the\nassociated Kondo singlet. For large \u03b7, this peak vanishes\naccording to the single quench dynamics for \u03c4 = \u221e where\nonly a Kondo singlet of energy TK exists. Indeed, for intermediate \u03b7, a second peak emerges at TK with a height\nof only half of its equilibrium value, as half of the time\nthe interaction is switched off. Thus, the n = 0 component of the dynamical susceptibility shows the crossover\nfrom a Kondo singlet of binding energy TK at \u03c4 = \u221e to a\nKondo singlet with binding energy TK /2 for \u03c4 = 0. The\noscillations appearing for large \u03b7 originate in the periodic\nstructure near the half period boundary of \u03c7(tav , \u03b5) that\ncan be seen in Fig. 4.\nThe n = 1 and n = 2 modes that correspond to processes where one or two energy quanta \u03a9 are absorbed\nare shown in the lower two plots of Fig. 5. Due to the\nrelation\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\nFIG. 5: Universal curves of the zeroth, first and second mode\n\u03c700n (\u03b5 \u2212 n\u03a9/2) for different values of the parameter \u03b7.\n\nResults for \u03c700n (\u03b5): In Fig. 5, universal curves for the\nmodes \u03c700n (\u03b5) are shown. In the upper plot of the n = 0\ncomponent, one can nicely see the crossover from the\nfast to the slow driving regime. For fast driving, small \u03b7,\none observes a peak located at \u03b5 \u2248 TK /2, whose height\nand position decreases by increasing \u03b7. This signals a de-\n\n(41)\n\nthese results can be extended straightforwardly to the\nn = \u22121, \u22122 modes.\nFor small periods \u03c4 , all modes n 6= 0 vanish due to the\nequilibrium-like dynamics where absorption and emission\nof photons is not taking place. As \u03a9 \u2192 \u221e for \u03c4 \u2192 0,\nthe absorption or emission of an energy quantum \u03a9 involves high energy transfers that are cut off by the finite\nwidth of the local hybridized d level. The equilibrium\nspin fluctuations of the conduction-band electrons in the\nKondo model at large energies are suppressed due to energy conservation. As mentioned in Sec. III, the only\ninfluence of the periodic driving is the enhancement of\ncertain fluctuations that are present in the equilibrium\nversions of the involved Hamiltonians. If the equilibrium\nfluctuations already vanish, their enhancement due to the\nperiodic driving is negligible, too.\nThe larger the parameter \u03b7, the larger becomes the response for processes under absorption and emission, as\nthe excitations generated by the periodic driving now\nturn out to be excitations of lower energy as \u03a9 decreases.\nIn the limit \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e, however, the n 6= 0 components\nare expected to vanish as in the \u03c4 \u2192 0 limit, since the\nsystem is able to relax during each half period and locally behaves as in equilibrium nearly all of the time.\nThe behavior for the n = 1 and n = 2 components is\nqualitatively different for energies above or below n\u03a9/2.\nThe absorption or emission of one photon is likely for the\nn = 1 mode whereas the n = 2 mode decays to zero much\nfaster away from its maximum. The different properties\nof the even and odd modes can be traced back to Eq. (10),\nstating that the square wave driving can be thought of as\na non-monochromatic driving including all frequencies of\nodd multiples of \u03a9.\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this work, the steady state in a periodically driven\nKondo model in the Toulouse limit has been investigated\n\n\f12\nby analyzing exact analytical results for the local spin\ndynamics at zero temperature. Remarkably, the analysis revealed a universal asymptotic long-time behavior\nof the spin-spin correlation function, compare Eq. (31),\nindependent of the driving matching precisely the zero\ntemperature equilibrium result. This universality originates in the discrete character of the excitation spectrum\nthat leaves the low-energy excitations in the immediate\nvicinity of the Fermi level unchanged.\nFor large switching times, \u03c4 /tK \u2192 \u221e where tK is the\nequilibrium Kondo time scale, the local observables behave as for a single interaction quench, since the system\nis able to relax during each half period. In the opposite\nlimit, \u03c4 /tK \u2192 0, the system is not able to follow the\nfast externally prescribed perturbation. Although the\ndynamics is \"equilibrium-like\" (in the sense that timetranslational invariance is restored, e.g. Eq. (28)), it is\nimpossible to find an effective equilibrium Hamiltonian\ngenerating the same dynamics. This can be seen in the\ndiscussion below Eq. (29) were it was shown that the\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem is violated for the local\nspin observable. Consequently, the steady state created\nby the periodic time-dependent setup provides an example for the possibility to reach new quantum states in systems out of equilibrium that are not accessible by equilibrium thermodynamics. The reason for the existence\nof this unusual steady state is the inapplicability of the\nTrotter formula in the present periodic time-dependent\nsetup. This observation might also be useful for other\nperiodically driven systems.\nRemarkably, in the Toulouse limit the Kondo effect is\nrobust against the periodic driving as long as the driving\nfrequency is unable to induce charge fluctuations in the\nquantum dot. Even in the case of fast driving \u03a9 \u001d TK\nthe Kondo singlet survives. The associated binding energy TK /2 is reduced to half of its equilibrium value. For\nintermediate \u03c4 , a crossover is observed from a Kondo singlet of binding energy TK /2 in the fast switching limit to\na Kondo singlet of binding energy TK for long switching\ntimes.\nIt would be interesting to investigate related questions\nfor the Kondo model away from the Toulouse limit, where\none also expects that the flow to the strong-coupling fixed\npoint itself is affected by the periodic switching.
