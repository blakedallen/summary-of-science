The constraints on reaction rates are obtained and in two-species case, they are solved to obtain a solvable model.\nThe conditional probabilities of this model are calculated.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nOne-dimensional asymmetric simple exclusion processes (ASEP) have been shown\nto be of physical interest in various problems in recent years. These problems\nare, for example: the kinetics of biopolymerization [1][2], traffic models [3],\npolymers in random media, dynamical models of interface growth [4][5], noisy\nBurgers equation [6], and study of the shocks [7][8]. There are many review\narticles in these fields, see for example [9]-[15].\nThe totally ASEP has been solved exactly in ref.[16]. In this simple model,\neach lattice site is occupied by at most one particle and particles hop with\nrate one to their right-neighboring sites if they are not occupied. The model is\ncompletely specified by a master equation and a boundary condition, imposed\non probabilities appear in the master equation. The coordinate Bethe ansatz\nhas been used to show the factorization of the N -particle scattering matrix to\nthe two-particle matrices.\nBy choosing other suitable boundary conditions, without changing the master equation, one may study the more complicated reaction-diffusion processes,\neven with long-range interaction. In ref.[17], the so-called drop-push model has\nbeen studied by this method. In this model the particle hops to the next right\nsite even it is occupied. The particle hops to this site by pushing all the neighboring particles to their next right sites, with a rate depending on the number\n\u2217 alimohmd@ut.ac.ir\n\n1\n\n\fof right neighboring particles. The generalization of this model, by considering\nboth the right and left hopping, has been done in ref.[18]. Further generalization of the ASEP boundary condition have been proposed in [19]-[21]. As a\ncomprehensive review on the ASEP, see [22].\nAll of the above studies are about the single-species systems. If one considers\nthe model with more-than-one species, the situation becomes more complicated.\nThe source of complexity is the abovementioned factorization of N -particle scattering matrix, which in these cases restricts the two-particle S-matrices satisfies\nin some kind of spectral Yang-Baxter (SYB) equation. In ref.[23], all the solvable two-species reaction-diffusion models, in which the number of particles is\nconstant in time and the reaction rates are all equal, have been obtained. It\nwas shown that there are 28 independent interactions (among 4096 possible\ntypes) which are solvable. One of these 28 models, in which the particles have\nexchange-interaction: A + B \u2192 B + A, has been generalized to p species in\nref.[24]. In this model, besides diffusion to the right (with equal rates), particles\ninteract through Aj + Ai \u2192 Ai + Aj with rate rij . The spectrum of rij , to ensure the solvability, has been obtained. Another multi-species reaction-diffusion\nmodel, which somehow relates to one considered in [24], has been discussed in\n[25]. In this model the particles have exchange-interaction with rates which are\ndetermined by the differences of their diffusion rates.\nThe multi-species generalization of the models considered in [23], has been\nconsidered in [26]. The processes are\nA\u03b1 \u2205\nA\u03b1 A\u03b2\n\n\u2192 \u2205A\u03b1 with rate 1,\n\u2192 A\u03b3 A\u03b4 with rate c\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03b3\u03b4 .\n\n(1)\n\nAgain the solvability restricts the reaction rates c\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03b3\u03b4 . Some general remarks on\nthe solution of SYB equation, and some special solutions of it have been given\nin [26].\nRecently, the generalization of the drop-push model to multi-species case has\nbeen considered in ref.[27]. The reactions are\nA\u03b1 \u2205\nA\u03b1 A\u03b2 \u2205\n\n\u2192 \u2205A\u03b1 with rate 1,\n\u2192 \u2205A\u03b3 A\u03b4 with rate b\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03b3\u03b4 .\n\n(2)\n\nThe same drop-push reactions, but with n adjacent particles and with rates that\nare specified by a specific combinations of b\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03b3\u03b4 's, also exist. Some comments have\nbeen given for solutions of SYB equation in [27]. The reactions (2) are called\nthe extended drop-push reactions.\nIn this paper we are going to study the most general multi-species model, i.e.\nthe most general boundary condition, which all the previous mentioned models\nare the special cases of it. In its general form, the reactions are\nA\u03b1 \u2205\nA\u03b1 A\u03b2\nA\u03b1 A\u03b2 \u2205\n\n\u2192 \u2205A\u03b1 with rate 1,\n\u2192 A\u03b3 A\u03b4 with rate c\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03b3\u03b4 ,\n\n\u2192 \u2205A\u03b3 A\u03b4\n..\n.\n\nwith rate b\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03b3\u03b4 ,\n(3)\n\nwhere the dots indicates the other drop-push reactions with n adjacent particles,\nin which in the meantime the types of the particles can also be changed. We\n2\n\n\fshow that the reaction rates must satisfy some specific constraints, in order that\nwe have a set of consistent evolution equations. The two-particle S-matrices of\nthis general multi-species model must also satisfy SYB equation, which in this\ncase becomes more complicated. In the two-species case, we study a special\nclass of reactions (3) in detail and show that in this class, there is only one\nsolvable model, i.e. the solution of SYB equation is unique in this case. We\nstudy some physical properties of this unique model.\nThe scheme of the paper is the following. In section 2, by using the law of\nconservation of probabilities, we obtain the most general boundary condition\nfor a p-species reaction-diffusion model, in terms of two p2 \u00d7 p2 matrices b and\nc. We obtain a constraint on the sum of the elements of each column of matrix\nb + c. We see that in special cases, this model is same as those have been\nstudied previously. In section 3, we consider the matrix c as a diagonal matrix.\nIt is shown that there are two cases. In the first case, the matrix b must be also\ndiagonal, which the model reduces to the ordinary, i.e. single-species, drop-push\nmodel with variable rate. In the second case, c must be zero matrix, which the\nmodel becomes the one considered in [27], that is the extended drop-push model.\nIn section 4, we take c a non-diagonal matrix and obtain the necessary and\nsufficient conditions (constraints) for the matrices b and c, to have a consistent\nevolution equations. We see that the reactions are those indicated in eq.(3).\nWe find some classes of solutions of this set of constraints. In section 5, we\ninvestigate the coordinate Bethe ansatz solution for our problem and obtain the\nSYB equation, to ensure the solvability of the model. For p = 2, we show that for\na specific class of parameters, which corresponds to a special exchange-reaction\ntogether with a special extended drop-push model, the SYB equation has a\nunique solution. Finally in section 6, the conditional two-particle probabilities\nare calculated for this unique model, and their large-time behaviour are studied.\n\n2\n\nThe general boundary condition\n\nConsider a p-species system with particles A1 , A2 , * * * , Ap . The basic quantities\nthat we are interested in are the probabilities P\u03b11 ***\u03b1N (x1 , * * * , xN ; t) for finding\nat time t the particle of type \u03b11 at site x1 , particle of type \u03b12 at site x2 ,\netc.. We take these functions to define probabilities only in the physical region\nx1 < x2 < ... < xN . The most general master equation for an asymmetric\nexclusion process is\n\u2202\nP\u03b1 ***\u03b1 (x1 , * * * , xN ; t) =\n\u2202t 1 N\n\nP\u03b11 ***\u03b1N (x1 \u2212 1, * * * , xN ; t) + * * * + P\u03b11 ***\u03b1N (x1 , * * * , xN \u2212 1; t)\n\u2212N P\u03b11 ***\u03b1N (x1 , * * * , xN ; t).\n\n(4)\n\nThis equation describes a collection of N particles drifting to the right with\nunit rate. It can be shown that if one decides to solve the master equation by\ncoordinate Bethe ansatz method, one may only choose all the diffusion rates\nequal, which can be scaled to one [24]. So in eq.(4), we take all the diffusion\nrates equal to one. The master equation (4) is only valid for\nxi < xi+1 \u2212 1,\n\n(5)\n\nsince for xi = xi+1 \u2212 1, there will be terms with xi = xi+1 in the right-hand\nside of eq.(4), which is out of the physical region. One can, however, assume\n3\n\n\fthat (4) is correct for all the physical region xi < xi+1 , and impose certain\nboundary conditions for xi = xi+1 . These boundary conditions determine the\nnature of the interactions between particles. Now the question is that what are\nthe possible boundary conditions? To see this, we follow the same argument\nwhich has been given for single-species model in [28].

The only possible choice that leads\nthe right-hand side of eq.(6) to zero, and consistent with more-than-two particle\nanalogue of eq.(6) (see ref.[28]) is taking P\u03b11 \u03b12 (x, x; t) as a linear combination of\nP\u03b21 \u03b22 (x, x + 1; t) and P\u03b21 \u03b22 (x \u2212 1, x; t)'s.

So the\nleft-hand side of (6) is zero, without summing over \u03b11 and \u03b12 , and therefore\nX\nX\n\u03b11 \u03b12\n\u2212\n(x, x + 1) = 0.\n(10)\nP\nP\u03b11 \u03b12 (x, x + 1) +\n(b + c)\u03b1\n1 \u03b12 \u03b11 \u03b12\nx\n\nx\n\nSo in diagonal case, we have, instead of condition (9),\nb = 1 \u2212 c.\n4\n\n(11)\n\n\fThe simple exclusion processes of [16] is an example of this model with p = 1\nand b = 0, the drop-push model with equal rate is p = 1 and c = 0 case, and with\nnon-equal rate, is an example of one-species case of eqs. (7) and (11) [17]. The\ntwo-species model of [23], special p-species of [24] and general p-species reactions\nof [26] are examples of eqs. (7) and (9) with b = 0. Finally the extended droppush model of [27] is an example with c = 0. Now we are going to consider the\nsituations which have not been studied yet, that is the multi-species boundary\nconditions in which both b and c matrices present.\n\n3\n\nDiagonal c\n\nAs the first step of our study, let us consider the matrix c to be diagonal. As we\nwill show in the next section, the non-diagonal elements of c are reaction rates\nand so they are non-negative, but the diagonal elements are not reaction rates\nand are defined through eq.(9), which for diagonal c results\nX\n\u03b21 \u03b22\n.\n(12)\nc\u03b2\u03b211 \u03b2\u03b222 = 1 \u2212\nb\u03b1\n1 \u03b12\n\u03b1\n\nNow consider \u1e56\u03b11 \u03b12 (x, x + 1). Using eqs.(4), (7) and (12), one finds\nX\n\u1e56\u03b11 \u03b12 (x, x + 1) = P\u03b11 \u03b12 (x \u2212 1, x + 1) +\nb\u03b2\u03b111\u03b2\u03b122 P\u03b21 \u03b22 (x \u2212 1, x)\n\u2212(1 +\n\nX\n\n\u03b2\n\nb\u03b2\u03b111\u03b2\u03b122 )P\u03b11 \u03b12 (x, x + 1).\n\n(13)\n\n\u03b2\n\nThe above evolution equation determines the following reactions as the source\nand sink of this model\nA\u03b1 \u2205\nA\u03b21 A\u03b22 \u2205\n\n\u2192 \u2205A\u03b1 with rate 1,\n\u03b21 \u03b22\n.\n\u2192 \u2205A\u03b11 A\u03b12 with rate b\u03b1\n1 \u03b12\n\n(14)\n\nTo check the consistency of our description, we next consider the 3-particle\nprobability P\u03b11 \u03b12 \u03b13 (x\u22121, x, x+1). In this case, the boundary term P\u03b11 \u03b12 \u03b13 (x\u2212\n1, x, x) appears in the right-hand side of master equation. To calculate this term,\nwe must use the boundary condition (7) in two steps. The result is\nX\nX \u03b3\u03b3\n\u03b11 \u03b22\n\u03b22 \u03b23\nP\u03b11 \u03b12 \u03b13 (x \u2212 1, x, x) =\n[\nP\u03b11 \u03b22 \u03b23 (x \u2212 1, x, x)]\nb\u03b1\nb\u03b111 \u03b222 P\u03b31 \u03b32 \u03b23 (x \u2212 2, x \u2212 1, x) + c\u03b1\n2 \u03b13\n1 \u03b22\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b3\n\n\u03b12 \u03b13\n(x \u2212 1, x, x + 1).\nP\n+c\u03b1\n2 \u03b13 \u03b11 \u03b12 \u03b13\n\nIt is seen that the boundary term P\u03b11 \u03b12 \u03b13 (x \u2212 1, x, x) is found as a linear combination of other boundary terms, i.e. P\u03b11 \u03b22 \u03b23 (x \u2212 1, x, x)'s. To avoid this\nproblem, which in general does not lead to a consistent description of the interactions, we have two choices. One choice is to restrict ourselves to the cases in\nwhich the multiplication factors of the boundary terms in the right-hand side\nof eq.(15) are zero. Then\nX\n\u03b22 \u03b23\n1 \u03b22 \u03b22 \u03b23\n= 0.\n(16)\nc\u03b1\nb\u03b3\u03b111\u03b3\u03b222 )b\u03b1\n\u03b11 \u03b22 b\u03b12 \u03b13 = (1 \u2212\n2 \u03b13\n\u03b3\n\n5\n\n(15)\n\n\fP\n\u03b11 \u03b22\n\u03b22 \u03b23\n= 0 (i.e. \u03b3 b\u03b3\u03b111\u03b3\u03b222 =\nSo for non-zero reaction rates, i.e. b\u03b1\n6= 0, we have c\u03b1\n2 \u03b13\n1 \u03b22\n1). In this case the model reduced to one studied in [27], that is the extended\ndrop-push model.\nThe second choice is to consider the situations in which the boundary term\nin the right-hand side of eq.(15) is the same as one appeared in the left-hand\nside. In other words, we choose\n\u03b11 \u03b22 \u03b22 \u03b23\n= r\u03b11 \u03b12 \u03b13 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b222 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b233 .\nb\nc\u03b1\n1 \u03b22 \u03b12 \u03b13\n\n(17)\n\nThis means that the matrix b must be also diagonal.

This completes our investigation and the final processes are those indicated in (32). Of course, the question of solvability is open yet.\nAs the elements of matrix b and the non-diagonal elements of matrix c are\nreaction rates, they must be non-negative, and this point restricts the allowed\nsolutions of eqs.(9), (26) and (31). Let us focus on two class of solutions. To\nbe specific, we consider p = 2 case, but the arguments can be easily applied\nto arbitrary p. In p = 2, we may denote the two-particle states (\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) as\nfollowing:\n|1 >= (1, 1) , |2 >= (1, 2) , |3 >= (2, 1) , |4 >= (2, 2).\n\n(36)\n\nsolution of class 1: If b\u03b2\u03b122\u03b2\u03b133 in eq.(26) is independent of \u03b22 , that is\np\u03b23\n2\u03b23\n3\nb1\u03b2\n\u03b12 \u03b13 = b\u03b12 \u03b13 = * * * = b\u03b12 \u03b13 ,\n\nthen eq.(26) reduces to\n\nX\n\nc\u03b3\u03b111\u03b3\u03b22 = 0.\n\n\u03b2\n\n8\n\n(37)\n(38)\n\n\fFor p = 2, eq.(37) gives bi 1 = bi 3 ( for \u03b23 = 1) and bi 2 = bi 4 ( for \u03b23 = 2), and\neq.(38) for \u03b11 = 1, 2 specifies the elements of c as following\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u2212c21 c12\n0\n0\n\uf8ec c21 \u2212c12\n0\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\nc=\uf8ec\n(39)\n\uf8ed 0\n0\n\u2212c43 c34 \uf8f8\n3\n4\n0\n0\nc4\n\u2212c3\n\nIt can be easily shown that if we take the sum of elements of each column of b\nequal to one, then the constraints (9) and (31) are also satisfied. The resulting\nmodel is a ten-parameter reaction-diffusion model.\n\u03b31 \u03b32\n3\nand b\u03b2\u03b3\nsolution of class 2: If we take, for each \u03b2, one or both of c\u03b1\n\u03b12 \u03b13\n1\u03b2\n\u03b31 \u03b32\nequal to zero, then eq.(26) is satisfied. In p = 2, we can take c\u03b11 2 = 0 and\n3\nb1\u03b3\n\u03b12 \u03b13 = 0, which means that taking zero the second and fourth rows of c and\nfirst P\nand second\nof b. Then solving (31), results b23 + b43 = b24 + b44 = 1\nPcolumns\n4\n3\nand i bi = i bi . Finally considering (9) and noting the non-negativity of\nreaction rates, gives\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0 0\n0\n0\n1 \u2212 c31\nc12\nc13 0\n\uf8ec 0 0\n\uf8ec\nb23\nb24 \uf8f7\n0\n0\n0\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7 , c=\uf8ec\n\uf8f7,\nb=\uf8ec\n1\n2\n3\n\uf8ed 0 0\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n0\n0\nc3\n1 \u2212 c1 \u2212c1 0 \uf8f8\n0 0 1 \u2212 b23 1 \u2212 b24\n0\n0\n0\n0\n(40)\nwith condition\n(b23 , b24 , c12 ) \u2264 1.\n(41)\nIn p = 2, one can show that these two classes are the complete set of solutions\nof the constraint equations. Now we must seek the Bethe ansatz solution for\nthe allowed set of parameters.\n\n5\n\nThe Bethe ansatz solution\n\nTo solve the master equation (4) with boundary condition (7), we consider the\nfollowing ansatz\nP\u03b11 ,*** ,\u03b1N (x; t) = e\u2212EN t \u03c8\u03b11 ,*** ,\u03b1N (x),\nwith\n\u03a8(x) =\n\nX\n\nA\u03c3 ei\u03c3(p).x .\n\n(42)\n(43)\n\n\u03c3\n\n\u03a8 is a tensor of rank N with components \u03c8\u03b11 ,*** ,\u03b1N (x), and the summation runs\nover the elements of the permutation group of N objects [29][30].

But we must note that\nthe generators of the permutation group satisfy \u03c3k \u03c3k+1 \u03c3k = \u03c3k+1 \u03c3k \u03c3k+1 , so\none also needs\nA\u03c3k \u03c3k+1 \u03c3k = A\u03c3k+1 \u03c3k \u03c3k+1 .\n(51)\nIn terms of S-matrices, eq.(51) becomes\nS12 (z2 , z3 )S23 (z1 , z3 )S12 (z1 , z2 ) = S23 (z1 , z2 )S12 (z1 , z3 )S23 (z2 , z3 ).\n\n(52)\n\nWriting S-matrix as the product of the permutation matrix \u03a0 and a R matrix:\nSk,k+1 =: \u03a0k,k+1 Rk,k+1 ,\n\n(53)\n\neq.(52) is transformed to\nR23 (z2 , z3 )R13 (z1 , z3 )R12 (z1 , z2 ) = R12 (z1 , z2 )R13 (z1 , z3 )R23 (z2 , z3 ).\n\n(54)\n\nThis is the spectral Yang-Baxter equation [31]-[33].\nNow the matrices b and c must be such that if one computes the two-particle\nS-matrix (50) by them, it satisfies the spectral Yang-Baxter equation (54), or\nequivalently eq.(52). These equations are complicated and determining the elements of b and c, in such a way that eq.(52) is satisfied, is not easy.\nFor b = 0, the S-matrix (50) becomes a binomial of degree one with respect to\nz2 and therefore (52) becomes a quadratic expression with respect to z3 . Using\nthis, one can transform the spectral Yang-Baxter equation (52) to a non-spectral\nmatrix equation for matrix c, which its study is much easier than eq.(52) [26].\nThe same is true for c = 0, since in this case eq.(50) is linear in z1\u22121 = e\u2212ip1\n[27]. When b and c are both different from zero, this procedure does not work\nbecause of the presence of z2 and z2\u22121 ( or equally z1 and z1\u22121 ) in both terms of\n(50).\nFor matrices b and c which are given in eq.(40), if one computes the corresponding S-matrix and writes eq.(52) as RHS - LHS = 0, then one has 64\n10\n\n\fequations that must be solved for five variables b23 , b24 , c12 , c13 and c31 . The solutions must be momentum-independent and non-negative. By obtaining the set\nof solutions of this system of equations by standard mathematical softwares, it\nis seen that all of the solutions are momentum-dependent except one. This only\nacceptable solution is: b23 = 1, and other four parameters are zero.
