For homogenized initial states we obtain quantitative\nagreement of the results from the respective approaches for the time evolution of the one-body\ndensity distribution and the osmotic pressure on the walls. We demonstrate that single particle information can be obtained experimentally in systems that were initialized further out-of-equilibrium\nsuch that complex lateral patterns form.\n\n1\n\n\fThe process of dispersed particles settling under gravity is a prevalent phenomenon in colloidal dispersions, relevant for isolation of cells from blood [1], separation of macromolecules\n[2], industrial filtration [3], and the shelf-life of paint [4]. As demonstrated by the beautiful\npioneering work of Perrin [5], particles with buoyant mass m that are exposed to a gravitational field with acceleration g can be viewed as being subject to a (linearly) changing\nlocal chemical potential \u03bc(z) = \u2212mgz + const, where z is the height variable. This provides\na means to access isotherms and e.g. study equilibrium phase behavior, provided that the\ngravitational length, \u03beg = kB T /(mg), where kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is temperature, is large compared to the inter-particle correlation length, but small compared to\nthe vertical container size L [6, 7]. In equilibrium a pressure gradient that originates from\nan inhomogeneous density profile, \u03c1(z), balances gravity and for a dilute dispersion ideal\ngas-like behavior results, \u03c1(z) \u221d exp(\u2212z/\u03beg ). In concentrated systems pronounced density\noscillations, indicative of liquid layering, occur near the lower wall [8].\nUnderstanding the time evolution of a given initial state towards sedimentation-diffusion\nequilibrium is a difficult problem due to the interplay of direct and (solvent-mediated) hydrodynamic interactions between the particles [9]. An isolated sphere of radius a in a solvent\nof dynamical viscosity \u03b7 sediments at an average (Stokes) velocity u0 = \u03930 mg, where the\nmobility is \u03930 = (6\u03c0\u03b7a)\u22121 for no-slip boundary conditions on the sphere. Two timescales\nare of relevance, that of diffusion is the Brownian time it takes a particle to diffuse over\na distance of one radius, \u03c4B = 3\u03c0\u03b7\u03c3 3 /(4kB T ), and that of gravity is the time it takes a\nparticle to sediment over one radius, \u03c4S = \u03c3/(2u0), where \u03c3 = 2a is the particle diameter.\nThe ratio between both is the Peclet number, Pe = \u03c4B /\u03c4S = a/\u03beg , that characterizes the\ntype of dynamics. Previous experiments were carried out using sedimenting granular matter\n[10] where the effects of diffusion are small (Pe \u226b 1), and using relatively small colloids\n[9, 11] where diffusion dominates (Pe \u226a 1). Steady-state in the intermediate regime was\nrecently investigated with computer simulations [12] showing that hydrodynamic backflow\neffects are relevant but depend little on Pe and that the velocity correlations are similar to\nthose near equilibrium.\nIn this Letter we investigate full non-equilibrium sedimentation of dispersions inside horizontal planar slits with plate distance L and Pe \u223c 1 using experiment, theory and simulation,\nall of which are capable of resolving the microscopic structure of the dispersion on the particle level. We obtain quantitative agreement of results from the respective approaches for\n2\n\n\fthe strongly inhomogeneous density profiles. This contributes to our understanding of the\neffects of particle correlations and confinement on the non-equilibrium time evolution of sedimentation and could be relevant for transport of cells in microfluidic devices [16], bacteria\nin groundwater [17] and in porous media [18].\nOur experimental system [19] consists of micron-sized, sterically stabilised, fluorescently\nlabelled Poly methyl methacrylate particles [20] (PMMA), dispersed in a mixture of cyclohexyl bromide (CHB) and cis-decalin with 260 \u03bcM tetrabutyl ammonium bromide (TBAB)\nsalt to screen the (weak) electrostatic interactions between the colloids, resulting in a Debye\nscreening length of \u223c100 nm [19]; see Tab. I for a summary of all relevant parameters. We\ntailored the density difference between solvent and particles to control the buoyant mass m\nand hence Pe. Initially dry capillaries were filled with the suspension; this is a very rapid\nprocess due to large capillary forces between the walls and the solvent. The capillaries were\nlaid flat such that the colloids sediment towards the bottom wall, and imaged with a confocal\nlaser scanning microscope, see Fig. 1a for an illustration. Confocal scans were made in three\ndimensions and time series are presented as slices in either vertical (xz, see Fig. 1b-d) or\nhorizontal (xy) planes. Coordinates of the particles were tracked in three dimensions [21],\nyielding the colloid density profile, \u03c1(z, t), as a function of the altitude z and time t. We\npresent results for L/\u03c3 = 12 (system A) and L/\u03c3 = 38.5 (system B).\nExperimental results for the time evolution of the sedimentation profile for system A\nare shown in Fig. 2a. The inital density distribution is almost flat, save for a small peak\nat the lower wall. This peak grows in time and two more layers appear. The final profile\nexhibits clear second and third layers and decays smoothly for higher altitudes. We have\nobserved no pronounced changes in the lateral (xy) structure, nor strong fluctuations in\nparticle velocity, in accord with the findings of Ref. 12 and contrasting with the case of\nstrongly driven (steady-state) sedimentation [10].\nA recent and very promising theory for the time evolution of the one-body density, \u03c1(r, t),\nwhere r is the position coordinate, is dynamical density functional theory [22, 23] (DDFT):\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202\u03c1\n\u03b4F [\u03c1]\n,\n(1)\n= \u2207 * \u0393\u03c1\u2207\n\u2202t\n\u03b4\u03c1\nwhere \u0393 is the mobility, F [\u03c1] is taken to be the equilibrium Helmholtz free energy functional,\nR\nR\nF [\u03c1] = kB T dr\u03c1(r)[ln(\u03c1(r, t)\u039b3 ) \u2212 1] + Fexc [\u03c1] + dr\u03c1(r)Vext (r), where the first term is the\n\nHelmholtz free energy of the ideal gas, \u039b is the (irrelevant) thermal wavelength, Fexc [\u03c1] is\n3\n\n\fthe excess (over ideal gas) contribution to the free energy, and the external potential in\nthe present case is Vext (r) = kB T z/\u03beg for \u03c3/2 < z < L \u2212 \u03c3/2 and \u221e otherwise. The\ninterparticle interactions are described by the excess free energy functional Fexc [\u03c1], which\nwe take to be that of hard spheres of diameter \u03c3eff > \u03c3 to model the (strongly screened)\nelectrostatic repulsion. We use Rosenfeld's successful fundamental-measures theory [24] to\napproximate Fexc [\u03c1]. As a simple treatment of hydrodynamic interactions we take into\naccount the reduction of \u0393 upon increasing density with the result by Hayakawa and Ichiki\n[25], \u0393HI (\u03c6)/\u03930 = (1 \u2212 \u03c6)3 /[1 + 2\u03c6 + 1.492\u03c6(1 \u2212 \u03c6)3 ], where \u03c6 = 4\u03c0\u03c1a3 /3 is the colloid\npacking fraction, and we generalize to strongly inhomogeneous situations by using the local\npacking fraction \u03c6\u0304(r, t), obtained as the convolution of the bare density profile, \u03c1(r, t),\nwith a weight function characteristic of the particle volume [24]. We determine values\nfor \u03beg and \u03c3eff such that the theoretical result for the equilibrium sedimentation profile\n[obtained from solving \u03b4F [\u03c1]/\u03b4\u03c1(r) = \u03bc for \u03c1(r), where \u03bc is the chemical potential] matches\nits experimental counterpart. The resulting agreement is very good indeed, see the top pair\nof curves in Fig. 2a. In addition we have checked that values for \u03c3eff are consistent with\nour experimental results for the radial distribution function (not shown) and that the values\nfor \u03beg are compatible with those obtained from estimating m from sample composition.\nWe assume \u03c1(r, t) = \u03c1(z, t), take \u03c1(z, t = 0) to be the equilibrium profile for hard spheres\nbetween hard walls without gravity, and integrate Eq. (1) forward in time. The results for\n\u03c1(z, t) compare very well with the experimental data, including the time evolution of the\nlayering at the bottom which was not captured in earlier treatments [9], where monotonic\ndensity profiles were obtained \u2013 as is appropriate on a macroscopic scale.\nWe further test the DDFT by comparing results for \u03c1(z, t) to those from BD simulations.\nTo correct for the finite resolution of the simulations, we have used an intrinsic clock to\nmeasure time: The clock ticks only when a trial move is accepted, but not when a trial\nmove is rejected due to hard core overlap. We have extensively tested this approach against\ntime step extrapolation [26] and are confident that it is accurate using time steps of 10\u22123 \u03c4B ,\nhence offering significant advantages in computational efficiency. We use a constant mobility\n\u0393HI (\u03c60 ) both in BD and DDFT, with \u03c60 being the overall packing fraction. The agreement\nbetween results from theory and simulation is remarkable, see Fig. 2b, establishing for the\nfirst time that DDFT is accurate for describing Brownian dynamics of hard spheres in\nthree dimensions; this is both of fundamental and practical importance due to the high\n4\n\n\fcomputational efficiency of the scheme.\nSystem B serves to investigate the crossover from strongly confined to macroscopic systems. In the early stages we find a large region at intermediate heights where the density\nremains nearly constant, reminiscent of batch settling [27], as well as a pronounced upper\ninterface of the sediment towards an essentially particle-free supernatant, see Fig. 2c. For\nlong times pronounced layering at the bottom of the container develops; we have analyzed\nthe lateral structure in the experiment and have ascertained that these layers remain liquidlike, with no signs of crystallization, which is expected to occur for yet more layers [28]. We\nachieve very good agreement of the experimental and theoretical results for \u03c1(z, t), albeit\nwith a small mismatch in time scales: The theoretical results are shown for a value of \u03c4B\nthat is 20% larger than the experimental value \u03c4B = 29.3 s, obtained from measurements\nof particle size and viscosity. The discrepancy might be due to particle size polydispersity\n(\u223c 5%) becoming more important in the case of the larger value of Pe in system B, and not\ntaken into account in the DDFT.\nThe detailed structural information contained in \u03c1(z, t) enables us to investigate the time\nevolution of important macroscopic quantities such as the osmotic pressure [8] exerted by\nthe particles on the bottom and top walls, Pb (t) = kB T \u03c1(z = \u03c3/2, t) and Pt (t) = kB T \u03c1(z =\nL \u2212 \u03c3/2, t), respectively. Results shown in Fig. 2d indicate a sharp initial increase in Pb (t)\nwith a crossover to slow relaxation for long times towards its equilibrium value, whereas\nPt (t) very rapidly decays (not shown). Note that in equilibrium Pb \u2212 Pt = kB T \u03bd/\u03beg , where\n\u03bd is the number density per area.\nIn order to drive the system further out-of-equilibrium we have altered the initial state by\nturning equilibrated samples upside-down, such that the colloids preferentially reside at the\ntop of the capillary. For this system \u03beg \u2248 0.35\u03c3 and L \u2248 18\u03c3, such that Pe \u2248 1.6. Despite the\nfact that these parameters are comparable to those considered above, sedimentation proceeds\nin an entirely different fashion. A strong degree of lateral inhomogeneity develops [29], see\nFig. 3. In the horizontal (xy) plane, see Fig. 3c, a network-like structure emerges [30]. The\nstructure formation is reminiscent of that resulting from the Rayleigh-Taylor instabililty in\ntwo layered liquids, given that the steep initial density gradient resembles that of a liquidliquid interface. There is likely a relationship between this phenomenon and the swirls\nobserved in sedimenting granular matter [10]. A theoretical investigation of this instability\nrequires an explicit treatment of the lateral x and y coordinates and a more sophisticated\n5\n\n\fhandling of the solvent hydrodynamics [31] than only through a density-dependent mobility;\nthese tasks are beyond the scope of the present work. We believe that DDFT, when extended\nalong these lines, could be a very promising candidate for studying such phenomena, both\non the grounds of the high accuracy in simpler situations (demonstrated above) and that it\nalso has been used successfully in the past to describe pattern formation in processes such\nas spinodal decomposition [32].\nIn conclusion we have presented the first measurements on the single-particle level of\nsedimentation in model colloidal dispersions. Unlike previous macroscopic descriptions that\napply when the gravitational length is much larger than the particle size [9], we have considered cases where both lengths are similar in magnitude. We have demonstrated that DDFT\ngives accurate results as compared to computer simulation results and that it describes\nlaterally homogenous sedimentation very well as compared to experimental data. Besides\nsystems that exhibit lateral pattern formation it would be interesting to investigate in future\nwork larger systems where crystallization occurs as well [33].\nWe thank A.J. Archer and H.

(b) Same as (a) but obtained from BD computer simulations (full lines) and\nDDFT (dashed lines); in both approaches a constant mobility is used. (c) Same as (a) but for\nsystem B for times t/\u03c4B = 7, 26, 44, 63, 255 (from bottom to top). Time t = 0 is set such that\nthe results for the earliest time match; the theoretical curves are scaled with a value of \u03c4B that is\n20% larger than the experimental value. The experimental result for t = 255\u03c4B is compared to the\ntheoretical equilibrium profile. (d) The osmotic pressure that the particles exert on the lower wall,\nPb (t), as a function of the scaled time, t/\u03c4B , as obtained from DDFT for system A (lower solid\nline) and system B (upper solid line).
