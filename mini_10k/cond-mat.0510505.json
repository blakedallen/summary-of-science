Depending on the band filling the effective\nfield theory has a form of a deformed Gross-Neveu model with either O(7) \u00d7 Z2 (half filling) or\nU (1) \u00d7 O(5) \u00d7 Z2 symmetry.\n\nAlthough high symmetries do not occur frequently in\nnature, they deserve attention since every new symmetry\nbrings with itself a possibility of new physics. According\nto [1], the SO(5) and SO(7) symmetries can be realized\nwithout fine-tuning of parameters in lattice models of\nisospin-3/2 fermions with a contact interaction. An experimental realization was found in [2], where a four component gas of fermionic K40 atoms was kept in an optical\ntrap for 50 seconds. In this letter we will limit ourselves\nto one dimensions where the corresponding models happen to be exactly solvable. The appropriate model is the\none-band generalized Hubbard model [1, 3]\nX\nX\n\u03c8\u03b1+ (i)\u03c8\u03b1 (i)\n[\u03c8\u03b1+ (i + 1)\u03c8\u03b1 (i) + h.c.] \u2212 \u03bc\nH = \u2212t\ni,\u03b1\n\ni,\u03b1\n\n+U0\n\nX\n\n+\nP0,0\n(i)P0,0 (i)\n\n+ U2\n\nX\n\n+\nP2,m\n(i)P2,m (i)\n\n(1)\n\ni,m\n\ni\n\nwhere \u03b1 and m take values \u03b1 = \u00b13/2, \u00b11/2 and m =\n0, \u00b11, \u00b12. The singlet (total spin ST = 0) and quintet (\n+\n+\nST = 2) pairing operators P0,0\n, P2,m\nare defined through\nthe Clebsch-Gordon coefficients\n+\n(i) =\nPF,m\n\nX 33\n33\nh ; F, m| ; \u03b1\u03b2i\u03c8\u03b1+ (i)\u03c8\u03b2+ (i),\n22\n22\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\nwhere F = 0, 2 and m = \u2212F, \u2212F + 1, ...F . In [1] it was\nshown that this model, together with its continuous version, have a precise U(1)\u00d7SO(5) symmetry at arbitrary\nfilling and SO(7) symmetry at half filling.\nIt was demonstrated later that, at least in the low energy limit, the total symmetry of these models is greater\nbeing U(1)\u00d7O(5)\u00d7Z2 and SO(7)\u00d7Z2 respectively [4, 5].\nFollowing the standard procedure (see, for example, [6]),\nat temperatures much smaller than the Fermi energy one\ncan linearize the fermionic spectrum in the vicinity of the\nright and left Fermi points and to arrive to the effective\nfield theory description. If the band filling is incommensurate, the charge sector decouples from the other degrees\nof freedom at low energies. In this limit the Hamiltonian\ncan be decomposed into a sum of the charge and the spin\npart H \u2248 Hcharge + Hspin , where the charge sector is described by the Gaussian model. All nontrivial physics is\nconcentrated in the spin Hamiltonian. It has SO(5)\u00d7Z2\n\nsymmetry. The four-fermion interaction can be written\nas a sum of products of the SU1 (4) currents of the right\nand left chirality [5], though its symmetry is lower than\nSU(4). To make the true symmetry manifest one can\nemploy the nonlinear transformation of fields suggested\nin [7] and rewrite the Hamiltonian density in the spin\nsector in terms of six species of Majorana fermions (the\nbosonized form of this Hamiltonian was obtained in [4]):\n5\n\niX\nvs (\u03c7\u0304a \u2202x \u03c7\u0304a \u2212 \u03c7a \u2202x \u03c7a ) +\n2 a=0\n!2\n!\n5\n5\nX\nX\ng\n\u03c7\u0304a \u03c7a\n+ 2gX (\u03c7\u03040 \u03c70 )\n\u03c7\u0304a \u03c7a .\n\nH=\u2212\n\na=1\n\n(2)\n\na=1\n\nwhere g \u223c \u2212(U0 +U2 ), gX \u223c \u22123U2 +U0 . One can run few\nsimple checks to justify that above model does represent\nthe continuum limit of (1). First, the interaction in (2)\nhas the right scaling dimension (in other words, this is\na model with four-fermion interaction). Second, at temperatures much higher than the spectral gap but much\nsmaller than the bandwidth, when the interactions can\nbe neglected, the two models have the same specific heat.\nThis corresponds to model (2) having the right ultraviolet\ncentral charge CUV = 3. Third, model (2) has the symmetry predicted in [5] (the Z2 symmetry corresponds to\n\u03c70 \u2192 \u2212\u03c70 ). In the limit g = gX the O(5)\u00d7Z2 model becomes the SO(6)\u2261SU(4) Gross-Neveu (GN) model. This\nlimit is also contained in original model (1) [5]. At half\nfilling, due to the Umklapp processes, the charge mode\nis not decoupled. Therefore the entire effective Hamiltonian is given by Eq.(2) with seven degenerate Majorana\nfermions instead of five (the O(7)\u00d7Z2 model).\nThe O(5)\u00d7Z2 (Eq. 2) and O(7)\u00d7Z2 models (further\ndown we refer to them as (5+1) and (7+1) models) have\nnontrivial dynamics for g > 0, when they scale to strong\ncoupling and spectral gaps are generated. As field theories they exist in two limits, both corresponding to integrable models [8]. One limit, associated to the largest\nsymmetry (SO(6) or SO(8)), is realized when g = gX .\nThe corresponding exactly solvable model is the SO(2N)\n(N = 3, 4) GN model [9, 10, 11, 12].\nIn this letter we discuss the exact solution of the\nanisotropic version of the models with g 6= gX . Most\n\n\f2\nof the calculations are conducted for the (5+1) case; at\nthe end of the paper we briefly discuss the O(7)\u00d7Z2 generalization. We construct the exact solution using the\nbootstrap procedure as described, for instance, in [11].\nNamely, guided by the symmetry of the model and the\nperturbation theory results we suggest the two-particle Smatrix. In integrable models, where multi-particle collisions are representable as a sequence of independent twoparticle ones (factorizability), such S-matrix contains all\ninformation about the spectrum and the thermodynamics, as well as off-shell properties, such as correlation\nfunctions. The two-particle S-matrix must satisfy the\ncrossing, unitarity and the Yang-Baxter conditions [13].\nThe latter one is a condition of associativity of the algebra of creation (annihilation) operators. This condition, being an overcomplete system of equations for the\nS-matrix elements, is very restrictive. Ones such solution is found, one has to complete the bootstrap process\nby calculating the free energy and comparing it with the\nperturbation theory for the model at hand.\nAs we shall see, the bootstrap solution we obtain does\nnot contain the fully symmetric (O(6) or O(8)) limit.\nThis suggests that the symmetric limit is unstable and\ncannot be reached asymptotically from the exact solution\nof the asymmetric model. This conclusion is supported\nby the analysis of the renormalization group (RG) equations. The RG equations for the O(2N+1)\u00d7Z2 model are\n[4, 8, 14]\n2\n\u0121 = \u2212(2N \u2212 1)g 2 \u2212 gX\n,\n\u0121X = \u22122N gX g.\n\n(3)\n\nThey have the following RG invariant: C = (g 2 \u2212\n2\ngX\n)/|gX |b , b = (2N \u2212 1)/N . From this it follows\nthat the distance from the symmetric line |g \u2212 gX | \u223c\n|C||gX |(N \u22121)/N does not decrease for all N \u2265 1 under\nthe increase in gX rendering this line unstable.\nThe integrability of the O(2N+1)\u00d7Z2 model is a natural extension of the N = 1 case studied in detail in\nRefs. 15, 16. In that case the two-particle S-matrix has\nthe form\n!\n\u1fb1,\u03b2\u0304\n[\u015c SU(2) ]\u03b1,\u03b2\n\u03b6\u03b4\u03b1\u1fb1\nS3+1 =\n,\n(4)\n\u03b6\u03b4\u03b1\u1fb1\n\u22121\nwhere \u03b1, \u1fb1 are in and out spinon indices, \u03b6(\u03b8) = (e\u03b8 \u2212\ni)/(e\u03b8 + i) and \u015c SU(2) is the S-matrix of SU(2) Thirring\nmodel [11, 17]. An important check of the validity of this\nS-matrix is that the Thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations constructed from it yield the correct UV central\ncharge c3+1 = 2 and particle multiplicity.\nThe S-matrix for the model (2) was outlined in [8] as\na generalization of the (3+1) case. In this letter we give\nfurther details of this solution. The suggested S-matrix\n\nhas the following form:\n\nS5+1\n\n\uf8f6\n\u015cvv \u015cvs \u2212I\u02c6\n= \uf8ed \u015cvs \u015css \u015cs0 \uf8f8 .\n\u2212I\u02c6 \u015cs0 \u22121\n\uf8eb\n\n(5)\n\nThe indices s and v label massive kinks belonging to the\n4-dimensional spinor representation and vector particles\n(associated to the original fermions \u03c7a ( a = 1, ...5)). The\nkink's mass is Ms ; the vector particles have masses Mv .\nIn the present model they are not bound states of kinks.\nThere is an additional singlet particle (corresponding to\nthe original \u03c70 fermion) with mass M0 . All masses are\nexpenentially small in the bare coupling constants. Since\nthere are only two couplings in the theory, Ms , Mv and\nM0 are not independent, though to determine this dependence one needs a microscopic derivation. As one\nmight have expected, the Majorana fermion \u03c70 acquires\na nontrivial phase factor by scattering on a kink:\n\u015cs0 (\u03b8) = \u03be(\u03b8) \u03b4\u03b1\u1fb1 ,\n\n\u03be(\u03b8) =\n\ne3\u03b8 \u2212 i\ne3\u03b8 + i\n\n(6)\n\n(\u03b1, \u1fb1 are in and out kink indices) and has a trivial Smatrix with the other vector particles. The rest of the\nnotations are as follows. \u015c vv , \u015c vs and \u015c ss are O(5) Smatrices of vector and spinor particles.

As usual,\nwe expect that the massless mode does not appear in\nthe Bethe ansatz for massive particles. We observe that\nin this limit the above TBA equations coincide with the\nones derived in [18] for the O(2N+1) GN model for the\ncase N = 2. The dressed energies \u01eb0 , \u01ebv , \u01ebs correspond\nto \u01ebN,\u22121 , \u01ebN \u22121,0 , \u01ebN,0 of [18]. This is an important selfconsistency check of our solution. Please note that while\n\u01ebN,\u22121 was an auxiliary particle in the O(5) GN model, in\nour model (M0 6= 0) it is a physical particle.\nWith the TBA equations one can run two additional\nchecks. First, by calculating the free energy at T >> Ma\n(for this end one can use the results of [18]) one finds the\nuniversal asymptotics F/L = \u2212CUV T 2 \u03c0 2 /6 such that at\nM0 6= 0 one gets CUV = 3. This is the correct asymptotics for a theory of 6 Majorana fermions. On the other\nhand the T << Ma limit reproduces another asymptotics\nZ\nX\nd\u03b8\ncosh \u03b8e\u2212Ma cosh \u03b8/T (17)\nF/L = \u2212T\nra Ma\n2\u03c0\na\nwith rs = 4, rv = 5, r0 = 1 being the correct particle\nmultiplicities.\nThe generalization for the (7+1) model is straightforward. Here we have 8 kinks, 7+1 vector particles and\n28 tensor particles. The S-matrix has the same block\nstructure as (5), but with\n\u03be7 (\u03b8) =\n\ne5\u03b8 \u2212 i\ne5\u03b8 + i\n\n(18)\n\nand an additional block Stt for the tensor particles. The\nblocks Svv and Stt coincide with the vector and tensor Smatrices of the O(7) GN model and are described in [18].\nThe spinor block Sss is similar in its form to (7) with\n\u03c0/3 substituted by \u03c0/5. It does not have poles since the\nvector particles are not bound states of spinors.\nThe spin sector at arbitrary filling and the entire model\n(1) at half filling are quantum liquids. Away from half\nfilling the corresponding order parameters and the phase\ndiagram are described in [4, 5]. At moderate forward\nscattering there are two phases corresponding to Density\nWave or the superfluid state of the BCS type. They\nare distingushed by the sign of coupling gX which does\nnot affect the excitation spectrum. Both these phases\nhave power law correlations and are separated by the\nIsing type Quantum Phase transition. Generalizing the\narguments given in [4], we conclude that for half filling\nthere are also two phases. Just one of them has an order\nparameter local in terms of the fermions: it is 2kF = \u03c0\nCharge Density Wave (CDW). It condenses at gX < 0;\nat gX > 0 the order parameter is nonlocal corresponding\nto a hidden (topological) order.\nThe fact that the O(6)( or O(8)) symmetry is broken\ndown to O(5)\u00d7Z2 (or O(7)\u00d7Z2 ) will play a role for the\ncorrelation functions. Indeed, the O(6) and O(8) groups\nhave two irreducible spinor representations and O(5) and\n\nO(7) have just one. As it was shown in [19], in the O(2N)\nGN model right and left moving fermions transform according to different spinor representations making it impossible to have a nonzero Green's function containing\nright and left fermions. However, since the O(8) symmetric point in model (2) is unstable, the number of kinks\nin the exact solution is the same as for the O(7) group,\nwhich has just one irreducible representation. Therefore\nthe Green's function of the right and left fermions may\nbe non zero. It is logical to assume that it does exist in\nthe dimerized phase corresponding to gX < 0. We intend\nto discuss this issue in subsequent publications.\nWe are grateful to A. Nersesyan, V. Fateev, F.\nSmirnov, F. Essler and especially G.
