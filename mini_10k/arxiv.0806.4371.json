The relevant framework for two light flavors is an SU (6|4)\npartially quenched theory, where the extra valence quarks differ only by their boundary conditions.\nFocusing on the pion electromagnetic form factor, finite volume corrections are calculated at nextto-leading order in the chiral expansion and are estimated to be small on current lattices.\nPACS numbers: 12.38.Gc,12.39.Fe\n\nTwisted Boundary Conditions and the Breit\nFrame. Simulations of QCD on Euclidean spacetime\nlattices are making progress towards quantitative understanding of strong interactions [1]. A source of systematic error in these calculations is the finite lattice volume.\nWhile observables generally depend upon the lattice volume, there is a potentially more serious effect: periodic\nboundary conditions on quark fields limit the available\nmomentum modes to integer multiples of 2\u03c0/L, where L\nis the size of the lattice. This presents difficulty for the\nstudy of hadronic properties at small momentum. Periodic boundary conditions, however, are often chosen for\nconvenience; and, a more general class of boundary conditions, twisted boundary conditions (TwBCs), see e.g. [2],\nare possible. A TwBC by an arbitrary twist angle \u03b8 on\nthe matter field \u03c8, has the form: \u03c8(x+L) = ei\u03b8 \u03c8(x), and\nconsequently the matter field has kinematic momentum\np = (2\u03c0n + \u03b8)/L, where n is an integer. The ability to\nproduce continuous hadronic momentum has motivated\nthe study of TwBCs in lattice QCD [3\u201316].\nProducing continuous hadronic momenta via TwBCs\ndoes not necessarily give one the ability to probe amplitudes at continuous momentum transfer. In fact, these\ntechniques are of no avail for flavor singlet form factors\nwhich require operator self-contractions. In a current\nself-contraction, the boundary condition chosen for the\nquark in the current does not affect the momenta of the\nexternal states. Flavor non-singlet form factors, however, can be accessed at continuous momentum transfer.\nA conceptually clear way to see this is to consider form\nfactors of flavor changing currents [8]. If the current induces a change from a quark flavor satisfying periodic\nboundary conditions to one satisfying TwBCs, continuous momentum transfer, \u03b8/L, will be induced. There\nis another way to utilize TwBCs for flavor non-singlet\ncurrents [14]. For this method, imagine that the current\nstrikes a quark of a given twist angle \u03b8, and then produces\na different twist angle \u03b8\u2032 . Here the momentum transfer\n(\u03b8\u2032 \u2212 \u03b8)/L is induced. In the infinite volume limit, these\nboundary conditions become irrelevant and the current\nthus produces momentum transfer by striking a single\n(non self-contracted) quark. Furthermore one can choose\n\n\u03b8\u2032 = \u2212\u03b8 to work in the Breit frame, which often simplifies the calculation of form factors. At finite volume,\nhowever, the initial- and final-state quarks are actually\ndistinct because a given field can only have one boundary\ncondition. Hence the lattice action must be described by\na theory with an enlarged valence flavor group [14]. The\npurpose of this note is to utilize the effective field theory\nfor the Breit frame implementation of TwBCs, discussed\nin [14], to compute volume corrections to observables, in\nparticular the pion electromagnetic form factor.\nPartially Quenched Chiral Perturbation Theory.\nTo address the long-distance effects of TwBCs in the\nBreit frame, we must formulate the low-energy effective\ntheory. From the discussion in [14], this variant of chiral perturbation theory includes additional fictitious valence quarks. These fictitious quarks only differ by their\nboundary conditions. We can remove the twists by a field\nredefinition in favor of periodic quark fields. In terms of\nthese fields, the quark part of the partially twisted, partially quenched QCD Lagrangian appears as\n\u0011\n\u0010\n/ + mQ Q,\nL = Q D\u0303\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the vector Q accommodates ten quark fields,\nQ = (u1 , u2 , d1 , d2 , j, l, \u01691 , \u01692 , d \u03031 , d \u03032 )T . The field Q\ntransforms under the fundamental representation of the\ngraded group SU (6|4). The quark mass matrix in the\nisospin limit1 of the valence and sea sectors is given by\nmQ = diag(mu , mu , mu , mu , mj , mj , mu , mu , mu , mu ).\nBecause we implement twisted boundary conditions only\nin the valence sector, we have additionally chosen to work\naway from the unitary point, where mj = mu . With this\nchoice, we can track sea-quark effects with ease and account for partial quenching errors. Formulae relevant at\nthe unitary point can easily be recovered by taking the\nlimit mj \u2192 mu .\n\n1\n\nAlthough we work with md = mu , we have kept the flavor group\nto be SU (6|4) [as opposed to SU (5|3)] to allow for strong isospin\nbreaking, md 6= mu .\n\n\f2\nThe Q field is periodic and the effects of partially\nTwBCs have been shuffled into the covariant derivative D\u0303\n/, where they have the form of a uniform U (1)\ngauge potential B\u03bc : D\u0303\u03bc = D\u03bc + iB\u03bc . The quark\nflavors are charged differently under this U (1) potential, specifically the flavor matrix is given by B\u03bc =\ndiag(B\u03bcu , \u2212B\u03bcu , \u2212B\u03bcd , B\u03bcd , 0, 0, B\u03bcu , \u2212B\u03bcu , \u2212B\u03bcd , B\u03bcd ). Because the U (1) field is uniform, the B\u03bc act as flavor\ndependent field momenta, each having the form B\u03bcq =\n(\u03b8 q /L, 0), where L is the spatial length of the lattice and\nq is a flavor index. Notice there is no fourth component to B\u03bc because the boundary conditions are only spatially twisted. The twist angles \u03b8 can be implementedq on\nthe lattice by modifying the links, Uj (x) \u2192 Uj (x)ei\u03b8j /L ,\nwhere j is a spatial index. Notice that the twist angles\nvanish for the sea-sector, this corresponds to the partially twisted scenario where existing gauge configurations can be post-multiplied by the uniform U (1) gauge\npotential. We additionally must choose the ghost quarks\nto be degenerate with their valence counterparts, and\nfurther to satisfy the same boundary conditions as their\nvalence counterparts. The determinant thus arises only\nfrom the sea quarks. The graded symmetry of SU (6|4)\nhence provides a way to write down a theory corresponding to partially twisted, partially quenched QCD, see [17]\nfor a more rigorous discussion.\nThe low-energy effective theory of partially quenched\nQCD is partially quenched chiral perturbation theory\n(PQ\u03c7PT), which describes the dynamics of pseudoGoldstone mesons arising from spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking. In finite volume, we restrict our analysis\nto the p-regime [18] in which the long-range fluctuations\nof the Goldstone modes cannot conspire to restore chiral symmetry.

At finite volume,\nmass splittings are generated, and kinematic momenta\nare renormalized by infrared effects [13]. These effects\nwere estimated to be on the order of a few percent on\ncurrent lattices. As we shall calculate finite volume corrections to the pion form factor, which themselves are\nat the percent level, we can safely ignore mass splittings\nand momentum renormalization below.\nPion Form Factor in Finite Volume. To calculate\nthe pion form factor on the lattice using TwBCs in the\nBreit frame, two separate current insertions are used. In\nthe first (second) insertion, the current strikes the up\n(anti-down) quark. Matching to this lattice setup, in our\ntheory we have2\n+\n+\nh\u03c021\n(0)|J\u03bc1 |\u03c011\n(0)i\n\n\u03b8 d =0\nL\u2192\u221e\n+\n\n+\n+\n(0)i\n+ h\u03c022\n(0)|J\u03bc2 |\u03c021\n+\n\n\u2212\u2192 h\u03c0 (\u2212p)|J\u03bc |\u03c0 (p)i,\n\n\u03b8 u =0\n\n(5)\n\nwith p = \u03b8/L fixed. The currents J\u03bc1,2 correspond to the\nphoton hitting the u and d quarks, respectively:\nJ\u03bc1 = qu u2 \u03b3\u03bc u1\n\n(6)\n\nJ\u03bc2 = qd d1 \u03b3\u03bc d2 .\n\n(7)\n\nHere qu , qd are the light quark electric charges. The current insertion effectively injects momentum by changing\nflavors, from u1 to u2 in the case of J\u03bc1 , for example.\nThese quark-level operators must of course be matched\nonto the effective theory.\n\n2\n\nThere are three other combinations of matrix elements that lead\nto the same infinite volume physics. This is due to the redundancy of the spectator quarks, which are evaluated at zero twist\nangle. We have verified that each of the four matrix elements calculated in the effective theory yield the same answer at infinite\nand finite volume.\n\nAt leading order the matching has already been performed in Eq. (2) as we have minimally coupled the\nsource field Aa\u03bc . As explained in [8], the generators T a\ncan be chosen purely in the valence sector. The simplest\nchoice is the obvious one: (T 1 )ij = \u03b4i2 \u03b4j1 corresponding\nto the current J\u03bc1 , and (T 2 )ij = \u03b4i3 \u03b4j4 corresponding to\nJ\u03bc2 . At next-to-leading order there is only one additional\nterm needed in the effective theory.3 This local correction\nto the current has the form\n\u0011i\nh \u0010\n\u03b4J\u03bca = i\u03b19 D\u0303\u03bd str T a [D\u0303\u03bc \u03a3\u2020 , D\u0303\u03bd \u03a3] \u2212 [D\u0303\u03bd \u03a3\u2020 , D\u0303\u03bc \u03a3] .\n\n(8)\nThis is just a rewriting of the current derived from the\nrelevant term of the Gasser-Leutwyler Lagrangian [19].\nAs \u03b4J\u03bca will only contribute to tree level, it will not appear\nin the expression for the finite volume correction. It is\ninstructive to note that this current depends only on the\nflavor non-singlet part of the generators. Any local terms\nin the effective theory arising from flavor singlet terms\nwill be inaccessible using TwBCs, as these must appear\n\u221d str(T a ) = 0.\nHaving written down the matching of the current in\nthe effective theory up to next-to-leading order, we can\nnow deduce the pion form factor at finite volume. As\nmentioned above, we work in the p-regime [18] with time\ntreated as infinite in extent. Furthermore, we choose\nto calculate the form factor from the time-component\nof the current as is done in the actual lattice calculations, e.g. [15, 16]. The loop diagrams contributing to\nthe form factor are depicted in [13]. The hairpin contributions exactly cancel, which is not surprising given\nthat flavor neutral mesons are electrically neutral. As a\ncheck on our calculation, we have verified that the infinite\nvolume form factor agrees with the known SU (4|2) partially quenched expression [20, 21]. Furthermore when\nmj = mu , the partially quenched expression turns into\nthe well-known infinite volume SU (2) result [22]. The finite volume modification \u03b4M(L) \u2261 M(L) \u2212 M(L = \u221e)\nto the time-component of the current matrix element is\ngiven by\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ 1 \"\n1\n\u03b8\n, m2ju\n\u03b4M(L) = 2E\u03c0 (\u03b8) 2\ndx \u2212 I1/2\nf 0\nL\n\u0013#\n\u0012\n\u03b82\n\u03b8\n2\n, (9)\n+ I1/2 (1 \u2212 2x) , mju + 4x(1 \u2212 x) 2\nL\nL\nwhere we have set the\np overall charge qu \u2212qd = 1. The pion\nenergy is E\u03c0 (\u03b8) = m2\u03c0 + \u03b8 2 /L2 , and the finite volume\nmodification is encoded in the function I1/2 (v, m2 ) [13].\nThere is no isospin breaking term in the above expression\n\n3\n\nThere are additional couplings that are exactly cancelled by\nwavefunction renormalization. Not surprisingly, these can be\nremoved from the current by a field redefinition.\n\n\f4\n0.00\n\nbreaking and cubic symmetry breaking terms from finite\nvolume effects [13]. While numerically the finite volume\neffect is demonstrated to be small for either kinematics,\nit would be interesting to investigate nucleon isovector\nquantities in the Breit frame. Results for the nucleon\nisovector magnetic moment suggested a larger than expected volume correction arising from cubic symmetry\nbreaking terms [12]. The Breit frame kinematics could\nmitigate such effects.\n\n\u2206L @G\u03a0 HQ2 L - 1D\n\n-0.02\n\n-0.04\n\nm\u03a0 =0.14 GeV\n\n-0.06\nm\u03a0 =0.25 GeV\n-0.08\nm\u03a0 =0.35 GeV\n-0.10\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n\u0398\n\nWe thank S.

In Fig. 1, we hold\nthe lattice size L fixed at 2.5 fm, and plot the relative difference \u03b4L [G\u03c0 (Q2 ) \u2212 1] as a function of \u03b8 for a few values\nof the pion mass. On current lattices, the volume corrections are at the percent level and become non-negligible\nonly for light pions with small twists.\nConclusion. Above we investigate an extension of\nPQ\u03c7PT which is relevant for lattice calculations using\nTwBCs in the Breit frame. For hadrons consisting of\ntwo light quark flavors, the appropriate theory has an\nenlarged SU (6|4) flavor group. The additional valence\nquarks are fictitious flavors differing only in their boundary conditions. This theory is described in [14], and we\nutilize it here to determine finite volume corrections for\nlattice calculations of the pion electromagnetic form factor. The result we derive is quite compact, maintains\nisospin symmetry, as well as a discrete rotational symmetry. This is in contrast to the result derived employing rest frame kinematics, which possessed both isospin\n\n\u2020\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n\nfjjiang@itp.unibe.ch\nbctiburz@umd.edu\nT.
