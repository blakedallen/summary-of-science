The fragmentation pattern\nand the momentum distribution (temperature) of the emanated fragments are\ndetermined by the phase space at the freeze-out volume where the interaction\namong the fragments is supposedly frozen out. However, to get coherence\nwith the experimental momentum distribution of the charged particles, one\nintroduces Coulomb acceleration beyond this freeze-out. To be consistent,\nwe investigate the effect of the attractive nuclear force beyond this volume\nand find that the possible recombination of the fragments alters the physical\nobservables significantly casting doubt on the consistency of the statistical\nmodel.\n\nPACS Number(s): 25.70.Pq 24.10.Pa\n\n1\n\n\fMultifragmentation of nuclear systems in energetic nuclear collisions serves a\nnovel window for understanding the properties of hot nuclear matter. It has a\nsensitive bearing on the nuclear equation of state (EoS) [1, 2], focusses our attention\non the possibility of liquid-gas phase transition in finite and infinite nuclear systems\n[3, 4] and from the production of rare isotopes helps for a better understanding\nof the nucleosynthesis in astrophysical context [5]. Various statistical models have\nbeen suggested to explain the phenomenon of nuclear multifragmentation; dynamical\nmodels have also been proposed which we will not discuss further in this work[1, 2, 6].\nBroadly the statistical approaches are classified in two groups, namely, sequential\nbinary decay (SBD) [7, 8] and one-step prompt multifragmentation (PM) [9, 10]. It\nis generally believed that at low excitation energy, fragmentation proceeds through\nSBD whereas at relatively higher energies, it is possibly a one-step break-up process.\nNuclear disassembly in the PM picture has been viewed as a statistical process and\ndifferent genres of statistical hierarchy have been employed to explain the physical\nprocess, from grand canonical [11], canonical [10] to micro-canonical [9]. In all these\nstatistical calculations, a freeze-out volume, around 3V0 to 8V0 (V0 being the normal\nnuclear volume of the fragmenting system) is employed when the PM process takes\nplace. The fragments so generated are the primary fragments which are in general\nin the excited states. Secondary decay from these hot fragments have been taken\ninto account [12, 13]. Furthermore, in the PM models the fragments are generally\ndistributed in the freeze-out volume and Coulomb trajectories are calculated for\nan improved description of the momentum distribution of the charged fragments.\nAt high excitation energies a collective motion further need to be added to the\nfragments [1, 2]. These are inconsistent with the assumption of freeze-out and is a\npointer to the inadequacy of the statistical model. On the same footing, the action of\ninterfragment nuclear force beyond freeze-out needs to be considered. The evolution\nof the fragments under the combined action of the Coulomb and nuclear fields has\n2\n\n\fnot been considered so far except the one reported in ref.[14]. In the exit channel\nmotion, two fragments, when close enough to be under the influence of the nuclear\nforce may recombine to produce an excited heavier fragment which may or may not\ndecay further. In [14], these effects were taken into account and it was found that the\nyield of relatively heavier fragments is enhanced significantly. Of course this implies\nthat the original yield and momentum distributions given by the statistical model\nare altered and in order to get, for instance, roughly the original yield, one has to\nadjust the parameters including the collective flow. The large success of statistical\nmodels (without recombination) in reproducing experimental data, has been tacitly\nassumed as a proof of equilibration in nuclear collisions. Including the nuclear force\n(which is a must) for such small freeze out volumes might significantly alter this\n'idola tribus' (or belief) and the role of dynamics, so far hidden under the carpet of\na few parameters and ideal assumptions, must be reconsidered. In this work we will\ndiscuss the role of nuclear forces in the model beyond the freeze-out; because we are\nadding some minimum of dynamical effects, we will dub our approach as Dynamical\nStatistical Fragmentation Model (DSFM). In a later work we will discuss the flow\neffects[14, 15]. The situation now is somewhat similar to fission, where one utilizes\nstatistical models to determine the mass distribution at the saddle point and evolves\nthe system including Coulomb, nuclear and even friction forces. At variance with\nfragmentation, the system evolves after the saddle point thus the mass distributions\ngiven by the statistical models are not altered. Including radial flow in DSFM will\nroughly cancel the effect of recombination and give a picture similar to the fission\none.\nIsotopic yields from multifragmentation have been employed to infer about important physical observables like the temperature of the fragmenting system [16]\nand the associated liquid-gas phase transition in finite nuclei. The effect of recombination has so far been ignored in drawing these inferences. The results reported\n3\n\n\fin[14] are restricted to a fixed freeze-out volume Vf and excitation energy E \u2217 ; no\nattempt was made to look into the consequences of the changed isotopic yield on\nthe physical observables after recombination. In the present communication, the\neffect of recombination with the variation in Vf as well as in E \u2217 has been addressed\nin some detail and we find that the importance of recombination on the multifragmentation scenario can not be ignored, further adding to the ambiguities of the\nstatistical approaches discussed above.\nThe model employed in the present calculation is the same as that in[14]. For\nthe sake of completeness, only the salient features of the methodology are discussed\nhere. In the first step, the fragment multiplicities ni for the various fragments are\nevaluated in the grand canonical model (GCM). They are given by\nni = Vf\n\nmAi\n2\u03c0h\u03042 \u03b2\n\n!3/2\n\n\u03c6i (\u03b2)exp[\u2212\u03b2(B \u2212 Bi + Vi \u2212 \u03bcn Ni \u2212 \u03bcp Zi )],\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b2 is the inverse of the temperature T , m the nucleon mass, Ai , Ni and Zi are\nthe mass, neutron and charge numbers of the fragment species i, B's are the ground\nstate binding energies of the fragmenting system and the generated species, \u03bc's are\nthe nucleonic chemical potentials and \u03c6i (\u03b2)'s are the internal partition function. The\ninternal partition function is calculated with the assumption that the excitation of\nthe fragment is below the particle emission threshold. The single particle potential\nVi is the sum of the Coulomb and nuclear interaction of the ith fragment with the\nrest of the fragments and is evaluated in the complementary fragment approximation [17, 18]. Employing the GCM fragment formation probability pi = ni /\n\nP\n\nni ,\n\nmicrocanonical events are generated following the method similar to that given by\nFai and Randrup [19]. After generation of fragments in a microcanonical event, the\nfragments are placed in a nonoverlapping manner within the freeze-out volume. The\nmicrocanonical temperature is evaluated from energy conservation. The fragment velocities are generated from a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution commensurate with\n4\n\n\fthe microcanonical temperature. At this stage the role of the statistical model is\nover, but a further Coulomb acceleration is now considered which is in contrast to\nthe statistical assumption. Even if the introduction of dynamics in the model is\naccepted, one should be consistent and include the nuclear forces as well since the\nnuclear surfaces in the freeze out volume are rather close to each other. Evaluation\nof the Coulomb interaction is straightforward; the nuclear part of the interfragment\ninteraction in the exit channel is broadly classified in three groups depending on the\nmasses of the fragments. The details are given in ref.[14]. Two fragments in the\nexit channel are assumed to coalesce when they touch each other. If the excitation\nenergy of the coalesced fragment is above the particle emission threshold (taken as\n8 MeV ), the fragment is assumed to undergo binary decay; the decay probability is\ncalculated in the transition state model of Swiatecki [20].\nTo study the effect of recombination in nuclear multifragmentation we have considered\n\n197\n\nAu as a representative system. In order to see the effect of recombination\n\non excitation energy, the calculations have been performed at E \u2217 /A=3, 4 and 5 MeV\nwith a fixed freeze-out volume Vf = 6V0 . Volume effects have also been considered\nwith E \u2217 /A fixed at 4 MeV . For generation of microcanonical ensemble, typically\n105 events have been used. Since we have assumed that the fragments are produced in the particle stable states, the charge or mass distribution is decided at the\nvery onset of fragmentation if there is no recombination. The recombined complex\nmay have excitation above the particle emission threshold and they may undergo\nsequential binary decay in flight till a particle-stable state is reached. In the panels\n(a), (b) and (c) of Fig.1, the charge distributions at different excitation energies at\nVf = 6V0 are displayed. Except for the very light charge particles, the fragment yield\nis substantially enhanced. At the lowest excitation energy considered (3 MeV /A),\nthe yield of very heavy fragments is found to be somewhat reduced. The neutron\nyield is enhanced at all the excitation energies considered. This behavior results\n5\n\n\ffrom a delicate interplay between fragment recombination and subsequent binary\ndecay. It is expected that with reduction in freeze-out volume, the recombination\neffect would be more prominent. This is apparent from Fig.1(b) and 1(d). This is\nfurther evident from the left panel of Fig.2 where the charge distribution has been\ndisplayed for a very large freeze-out volume (16V0 ) at the same excitation energy of 4\nMeV per particle. One would expect the recombination effect to be minimal at this\nlarge freeze-out volume, however, we find that though it is significantly reduced, it\nis not negligible, particularly for fragments with Z > 10. In order to understand the\npersistence of the recombination effect at this large freeze-out volume, we have calculated the surface to surface separation (S) of the different fragment pairs (Npair )\nproduced in a disassembly event. In the right panel of Fig.2, the average number\nof fragment pairs (hNpair i) present within the separation distance S is displayed\nfor different freeze-out volumes at E \u2217 /A = 4 MeV . The fragment pairs within the\nnuclear force range (taken as 1.4 f m shown as the horizontal dotted line) are potential candidates to undergo recombination. It is seen from the figure that even at\nVf = 16V0 , there are significant number of fragment pairs within the nuclear force\nfield.\nThe knowledge of temperature of the disassembling system is crucial in drawing many important physical inferences such as liquid-gas phase transition. There\nis no direct way to measure the temperature in such processes; a number of thermometers have been proposed to that end. Experimentally, it has been the usual\npractice to resort to the isotopic double-ratio [16] to extract the temperature which\nis based on the statistical multifragmentation model with certain approximations.\nIf the isotopic yield changes due to recombination, the extracted temperature based\non this model is bound to be erroneous. To investigate this aspect, we have calculated temperatures from different isotopic double-ratios at a number of excitation\nenergies with and without the effects of recombination. This is displayed in pan6\n\n\fels (a), (b) and (c) of Fig.3. It is found that the temperatures extracted without\nrecombinaton are consistent with the excitation energies, however, with inclusion\nof recombination effects, the extracted temperatures from the isotopic double-ratios\ndecrease dramatically. Recombination introduces a multitude of low temperature\nsources in the system which may be responsible for the reduction in the temperature observed. An anomalous fall in temperature at E \u2217 /A = 4 MeV is also seen for\nall the double-ratio thermometers. The temperature extracted after recombination\nare, however, found to be not too sensitive to the excitation energy(3-6 MeV per\nnucleon) that we have considered. The dependence of the double-ratio temperature\non the freeze-out volume is displayed in Fig.3(d). We have chosen a representative\nthermometer (d/t)/(3 He/4He) at an excitation energy E \u2217 /A = 4 MeV . Even at\nthe very large freeze-out volume of 16V0 , the temperatures extracted without and\nwith recombination effects are appreciably different, but a very slow approach to a\ncommon temperature with increasing Vf is apparent from the figure.\nTo sum up, the effect of recombination of fragments on the charge distributions\nand isotopic double-ratio temperatures in a nuclear disassembly process in the statistical model has been investigated in this paper at different excitation energies and\nfreeze-out volumes. The effect is found to be very significant for both the observables. With recombination, the yields for relatively heavy fragments are appreciably\nenhanced at all the excitation energies we have considered. This persistence of larger\nyield continues even at a freeze-out volume as large as 16V0 . With recombination\nconsidered, the isotopic double-ratio temperature is reduced dramatically. The extracted temperatures without recombination are found to be not too different from\nthose obtained in the Fermi gas model, however, with inclusion of recombination, in\nthe excitation energy range of 3-6 MeV per nucleon that we have investigated, the\ntemperatures are found to be \u223c 4 MeV and not too sensitive to the excitation energy. At relatively higher excitations, the collective flow and an improved dynamics\n7\n\n\fin the fusion process are likely to play a very important role and should be taken\ninto account. We, however, stress that the statistical approaches in a freeze-out\nscenario should not need any dynamics. The large effects seen with the introduction\nof dynamics (though has been done in an ad-hoc manner) even in a large freeze-out\nvolume is counter-intuitive and cast doubt on the applicability of the freeze-out concept in the fragmentation process; nonequilibrium dynamical features [1, 6] should\npossibly be incorporated at the very outset.\n\nAcknowledgement\nS.K.S. acknowledges the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research of the Government of India, for the financial support.

The right panel shows the\naverage number of fragment pairs within a separation distance S at different\nfreeze-out volumes at the same excitation energy.\nFig. 3 In panels (a), (b) and (c), different isotopic double-ratio temperatures are\nshown at various excitation energies at Vf = 6V0 with and without recombination. In panel (d), the volume dependence of the double-ratio temperature\n(d/t)/(3 He/4He) at E \u2217 /A =4 MeV is displayed.\n\n11\n\n\f10\n10\n\n2\n\nWith Recomb.\nNo Recomb.\n\n1\n\nVf/V0=6.0\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n*\n\nYield\n\n10\n10\n10\n10\n\nE /A=4 MeV\n\n0\n\n197\n\n\u22121\n\nAu\n\nVf/V0=6.0\n*\n\n\u22122\n\nE /A=3 MeV\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\n1\n\nVf/V0=4.1\n\n(c)\n\nVf/V0=6.0\n\n(d)\n\n*\n\nYield\n\n10\n10\n10\n10\n\nE /A=4 MeV\n\n0\n*\n\nE /A=5 MeV\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22123\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\nZ\nFig.1\n\n60\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\nZ\n\n60\n\n80\n\n\f10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\n3\n197\n\nWith Recomb.\nNo Recomb.\n\n1\n\nAu\n\n*\n\nE /A=4 MeV\n197\n\n0\n\nAu\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\nS(fm)\n\nYield\n\n*\n\nE /A=4 MeV\n\u22121\n\nVf/V0=16.0\n\u22122\n\n1\nVf/V0=4.1\nVf/V0=6.0\nVf/V0=16.0\n\n\u22123\n\n\u22124\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\nZ\n\nFig.2\n\n30\n\n0\n\n0\n\n50\n\n<Npair>\n\n100\n\n\f(a)\n\npd\u2212He\n\nNo Recomb.\nWith Recomb.\n\n5\n\n3\n\n7\n\nVf/V0=6.0\n\n3\n\n*\n\n4\n\n5\n\nT (MeV)\n\nT (MeV)\n\n7\n\n(b)\n197\n\nAu\n\ndt\u2212He\nVf/V0=6.0\n5\n\n3\n\n6\n\n3\n\n*\n\nE /A (MeV)\n\n(d)\n\ndt\u2212He\n\n(c)\n\nT (MeV)\n\nT (MeV)\n\n6\n\n7\n\nVf/V0=6.0\n5\n\n3\n\n5\n\nE /A (MeV)\n\nLi\u2212He\n7\n\n4\n\n3\n\n*\n\n4\n\n5\n\nE /A (MeV)\nFig.3\n\n6\n\n*\n\nE /A=4 MeV\n5\n\n3\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\nVf/V0\n\n16\n\n\f"}
