Email:\nadams@lorentz.leidenuniv.nl\n(16 Dec.'03)\nA simplified test of universality in Lattice QCD is performed by analytically evaluating the continuous Euclidean time limits of various lattice fermion determinants, both with and without a Wilson\nterm to lift the fermion doubling on the Euclidean time axis, and comparing them with each other\nand with zeta-regularised fermion determinant in the continuous time-lattice space setting. The\ndeterminant relations expected from universality considerations are found to be violated by a certain\ngauge field-dependent factor, i.e. we uncover a \"universality anomaly\". The physical significance,\nor lack thereof, of this factor is a delicate question which remains to be settled.\n11.15.Ha, 12.38.Gc\n\nThe low-lying spectrum of the naive lattice Dirac operator approximates the low-lying spectrum of the continuum\nDirac operator but with a 16-fold degeneracy due to fermion doubling [1]. Lattice QCD with a naive fermion is\ntherefore regarded as a regularisation of continuum QCD with 16 degenerate fermion flavours. Lattice QCD with a\nstaggered fermion [2] is regarded as a regularisation of 4 flavour QCD, in accordance with the fact that one naive\nfermion flavour is equivalent after spin diagonalisation to 4 staggered fermion flavours [3]. Lattice QCD with a Wilson\nfermion [1], where the Wilson term is added to the naive fermion action to lift the fermion doubling, is regarded as\na regularisation of QCD with a single fermion flavour. Implicit in this is a universality hypothesis: the LQCD's with\nnaive fermion, staggered fermion, and Wilson fermion are all in the right universality class to reproduce continuum\nQCD, the only difference being in the number of continuum fermion flavours the different lattice fermion formulations\ndescribe.\nIt is highly desirable to test this universality hypothesis wherever possible. This is particularly important in view\nof the fact that LQCD calculations with both dynamical Wilson and staggered fermions are currently being pursued\nat great effort and expense (see [4] for a recent review with references to the literature). An interesting quantity to\nconsider in this context is the fermion determinant, which appears in the QCD functional integral when the fermions\nare dynamical. In LQCD with dynamical staggered fermions, the fourth root of the staggered fermion determinant\nis used as the fermion determinant for a single quark flavour. An important test of the universality hypothesis would\ntherefore be to check whether the fourth power of the Wilson fermion determinant coincides with the staggered fermion\ndeterminant in the continuum limit, or, equivalently, whether the 16th power of the Wilson determinant coincides\nwith the naive fermion determinant in this limit. Such a test appears analytically impossible with currently known\ntechniques though. However, a simplified version of this test is feasible: instead of the full continuum limit one can take\nthe continuum limit for one of the spacetime coordinates while keeping the remaining coordinates discrete. The effect\nof including in the fermion action a Wilson-type term to lift the fermion doubling along the chosen coordinate axis\ncan then be investigated. In this paper we perform such a simplified test of universality by evaluating the continuous\nEuclidean time limits of the various lattice fermion determinants, both with and without the time part of the Wilson\nterm in the action, and comparing them with each other and with the fermion determinant in the continuous time-\nlattice space setting. (The fermion determinant in the latter setting is defined via zeta-regularisation.)\nOn a finite spacetime lattice, with N\u03c3 sites along the spacial axes \u03c3 = 1, 2, 3 , N\u03b2 sites along the Euclidean time\naxis, time lattice spacing=a, spacial lattice spacing=a\u2032, setting \u03b2 = aN\u03b2 =time length (=inverse\ntemperature in the\nP\nfinite temperature QCD setting), we consider lattice fermion actions of the form S = a(a\u2032 )3 (x,\u03c4 ) \u03c8\u0304(x, \u03c4 )D(r) \u03c8(x, \u03c4 )\nwhere (x, \u03c4 ) runs over the lattice sites and\nD(r) = \u03b34 a1 \u22074 +\n\u22074 \u03c8(x, \u03c4 ) =\n\nr\n2a \u22064\n\n+ Dspace + m\n\n1\n2 (U4 (x, \u03c4 )\u03c8(x, \u03c4\n\n(1)\n\u22121\n\n+ a) \u2212 U4 (x, \u03c4 \u2212 a)\n\n\u03c8(x, \u03c4 \u2212 a))\n\u22121\n\n\u22064 \u03c8(x, \u03c4 ) = 2\u03c8(x, \u03c4 ) \u2212 U4 (x, \u03c4 )\u03c8(x, \u03c4 + a) \u2212 U4 (x, \u03c4 \u2212 a)\n(r \u2032 )\nDspace\n\n=\n\n\u272aspace \u03c8(x, \u03c4 ) =\n\u2207\n\u272a\n\nr\u2032\n1\n\u272aspace + 2a\n\u2207\n\u2032 \u2206space\na\u2032 \u272a\n3\nX\n\u03b3\u03c3 12 (U\u03c3 (x, \u03c4 )\u03c8(x +\n\u03c3=1\n\n\u03c8(x, \u03c4 \u2212 a)\n\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n\n\u03c3\u0302, \u03c4 ) \u2212 U\u03c3 (x \u2212 \u03c3\u0302, \u03c4 )\u22121 \u03c8(x \u2212 \u03c3\u0302, \u03c4 ))\n\n1\n\n(5)\n\n\f\u2206space \u03c8(x, \u03c4 ) =\n\n3\nX\n\n(2\u03c8(x, \u03c4 ) \u2212 U\u03c3 (x, \u03c4 )\u03c8(x + \u03c3\u0302, \u03c4 ) \u2212 U\u03c3 (x \u2212 \u03c3\u0302, \u03c4 )\u22121 \u03c8(x \u2212 \u03c3\u0302, \u03c4 ))\n\n(6)\n\n\u03c3=1\n\nFor r = r\u2032 = 0 this is the naive fermion action while for r = r\u2032 6= 0 it is the Wilson action. We are going to evaluate the\n(r)\ncontinuous time limit (a \u2192 0 , N\u03b2 \u2192 \u221e with \u03b2 = aN\u03b2 held fixed) of the fermion determinants detD\u03b1 at r = 0 and\nr = 1 and compare them with each other and with the zeta-regularised fermion determinant det\u03b6 D\u03b1 in the continuous\ntime-lattice space setting. The Dirac operator in the latter setting is\nd\nD = \u03b34 ( d\u03c4\n+ A4 ) + Dspace + m\n\n(7)\nR1\n\naA (x,\u03c4 +(1\u2212t)a)dt\n\nwith A4 (x, \u03c4 ) being the 4-component of a smooth continuum gauge field such that U4 (x, \u03c4 ) = T e 0 4\n(r)\n(T=t-ordering) is the lattice transcript. The subscripts \"\u03b1\" in D\u03b1 and D\u03b1 refer to the operators defined by replacing\nU4 \u2192 e\u2212\u03b1a U4 in (1)\u2013(6) and A4 \u2192 A4 \u2212 \u03b1 in (7), respectively. The role of the complex parameter \u03b1 is to incorporate\n(r)\nthe effect of a general boundary condition at the time boundaries: D\u03b1 (resp. D\u03b1 ) with periodic time b.c. has the same\n(r)\nspectrum and determinant as D (resp. D) with time b.c. \u03c8(x, \u03b2) = e\u03b1\u03b2 \u03c8(x, 0). Thus the introduction of \u03b1 allows\nus to always take periodic time b.c. when considering the fermion determinant. It can also be used to incorporate a\nchemical potential \u03bc : QCD at finite temperature and density, where the fermion fields satisfy anti-periodic time b.c.,\ncorresponds to \u03b1 = \u03bc + i\u03c0/\u03b2. The gauge fields are required to satisfy periodic time b.c. The spacial b.c.'s for the\nfermion and gauge fields will not play a role in our considerations; we can simply take them to be periodic.\nr\nThe term 2a\n\u22064 in (1) is the \"time part\" of the usual Wilson term. It lifts the fermion doubling on the Euclidean\ntime axis when r 6= 0. Therefore, if we think of the continuous time-lattice space setting as the \"continuum setting\",\nthen the aforementioned universality hypothesis, which relates the continuum limits of the naive, staggered and Wilson\nfermion determinants, translates into the following\nSimplified universality hypothesis:\n\u0010\n\u00112\nlim detD\u03b1(0) = lim detD\u03b1(r)\n(mod p.i.f.'s)\n(8)\na\u21920\n\na\u21920\n\nr6=0\n\nwhere \"p.i.f.'s\" refers to 'physically inconsequential factors'. This is now something which can be checked analytically.\nOur main technical result in this paper is the following\nResult of calculation:\n\u00112 R \u03b2\n\u0010\nr\u2032\n\u2212\nT r ( 2a\n(0)\n(1)\n\u2032 \u2206space (\u03c4 )) d\u03c4\n(mod p.i.f.'s)\n(9)\ne 0\nlim detD\u03b1 = lim detD\u03b1\na\u21920\n\na\u21920\n\nwhere \u2206space (\u03c4 ) is defined on the space of lattice spinor fields \u03c8(x), living only on the spacial lattice, by replacing\n\u03c8(x, \u03c4 ) by \u03c8(x) in (6). The p.i.f.'s in (9) are gauge field-independent factors whose only effects are to produce constant\n(vacuum) shifts in certain physical quantities. They include inverse powers of a which diverge in the a \u2192 0 limit.\nThe result (9) reveals a \"universality anomaly\": the exponential factor in the right-hand side violates the universality\nexpectation (8). Thus it is important to ascertain the significance, or lack thereof, of this factor. Since it is gauge fielddependent it cannot strictly speaking be regarded as a p.i.f. in the continuous time-lattice space theory. However,\nr\u2032\nsince the spacial Wilson term 2a\n\u2032 \u2206space formally vanishes in the spacial continuum limit, one could argue that the\nexponential factor is effectively a p.i.f. when one goes on to take that limit. This is a delicate issue though, since\nT r a1\u2032 \u2206space actually diverges in in the a\u2032 \u2192 0 limit (note that in the free field case the largest eigenvalue of a1\u2032 \u2206space\nis \u223c a1\u2032 ). Further study is required to clarify this issue.\nSince the reasoning which leads to the universality expectation (8) is the same as that which leads to the expectation\nthat LQCD with naive, staggered and Wilson fermions are all in the same universality class, (9) is a potential reason for\nconcern about whether the latter universality hypothesis really holds. It would therefore be a significant reassurance\nif the anomaly factor in (9) can be shown to be physically inconsequential. It should be noted, however, that even\nif this turns out not to be the case, it would not in itself invalidate the universality hypothesis for LQCD with\nnaive, staggered and Wilson fermions, since the comparison between naive fermion (r = r\u2032 = 0) and Wilson fermion\n(r = r\u2032 6= 0) is not covered by (9) and we could still be lucky in this case. But it would certainly raise a serious\nconcern.\nRemarkably, the anomaly in (9) is mirrored by an ambiguity in the zeta-regularised fermion determinant in the\ncontinuous time-lattice space setting. The latter can be expressed either as det\u03b6 D\u03b1 or det\u03b6 (\u03b34 D\u03b1 ) (since \u03c8\u0304 = \u03c8 \u2217 \u03b34 ).\nFormally, the determinants of D\u03b1 and \u03b34 D\nR \u03b1 coincide, but it turns out that the rigorously defined zeta-determinants\ndo not. In fact we find det\u03b6 (\u03b34 D\u03b1 ) = e\n\n\u2212 21\n\n\u03b2\n\n0\n\n\u2032\n\nr\nT r ( 2a\n\u2032 \u2206space (\u03c4 )) d\u03c4\n\n2\n\ndet\u03b6 D\u03b1 (mod p.i.f.'s), and\n\n\flim detD\u03b1(1) = det\u03b6 D\u03b1\n\na\u21920\n\n,\n\nlim detD\u03b1(0) = det\u03b6 (\u03b34 D\u03b1 )2\n\na\u21920\n\n(mod p.i.f.'s)\n\n(10)\n\nThis shows that the lattice regularisations are consistent with zeta-regularisations of the fermion determinant in\nthe continuous time-lattice space setting, and that the requirement that the anomaly factor in (9) be physically\ninconsequential is also necessary for consistency of continuous time\u2013lattice space QCD when the fermion determinant\nis defined by zeta-regularisation.\nIn the remainder of this paper we sketch the derivation of (9)\u2013(10) and give other, more explicit, expressions for\n(0)\n(1)\nthe a \u2192 0 limits of detD\u03b1 and detD\u03b1 . The full details are provided in [5]. It is convenient to regard \u03c8(x, \u03c4 ) as a\nfunction \u03a8(\u03c4 ) living on the lattice sites of the Euclidean time axis and taking values in the vectorspace W = {\u03c8(x)},\ni.e. the space of lattice spinor fields living on the spacial lattice only. Set N := dim W . Define the linear operator\nU4 (\u03c4 ) on W by (U4 (\u03c4 )\u03c8)(x) = U4 (x, \u03c4 )\u03c8(x). The operator Dspace (\u03c4 ) on W is defined similarly by replacing \u03c8(x, \u03c4 ) by\n\u03c8(x) in (4)\u2013(6). Since \u03a8(\u03b2) = \u03a8(0) we can represent \u03a8 by the vector \u03a8\u0302 = (\u03a8\u0302(0), . . . , \u03a8\u0302(N\u03b2 \u2212 1)) where \u03a8\u0302(k) = \u03a8(ka).\nThen D(r) is represented by\n(r)\n\n(r)\n\n(r)\n\nD\u0302(r) \u03a8\u0302(k) = d\u22121 (k)\u03a8\u0302(k \u2212 1) + d0 (k)\u03a8\u0302(k) + d1 (k)\u03a8\u0302(k + 1)\n(r)\n\n(r)\n\nwhere the operators dj (k) : W \u2192 W are given by d1 (k) =\n(r)\n\n1\n2a\n\n(11)\n\n(r)\n\n1\n(\u03b34 \u2212 r) \u00db4 (k) , d\u22121 (k) = \u2212 2a\n(\u03b34 + r) \u00db4 (k \u2212 1)\u22121 ,\n(r)\n\nd0 (k) = ar + D\u0302space (k) + m with \u00db4 (k) := U4 (ka) and D\u0302space (k) := Dspace (ka). The generalisation of D\u0302(r) to D\u0302\u03b1 ,\n(r)\n(r)\n(r)\ngiven by U4 \u2192 e\u2212\u03b1a U4 , is equivalent to d\u00b11 \u2192 e\u2213\u03b1a d\u00b11 in (11). After writing D\u0302\u03b1 as an N\u03b2 \u00d7 N\u03b2 matrix, its\ndeterminant can be straightforwardly evaluated via the method of [6]. The cases r = 1 and r 6= 1 require separate\n(r)\ntreatments due to the fact that d\u00b11 (k) is invertible when r 6= 1 but not when r = 1. The details of the calculation\nare provided in [5]; here we simply quote the results, assuming for convenience that N\u03b2 is even in the r 6= 1 case:\n\u0012\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0010 (1 \u2212 r2 )2 \u0011N N\u03b2\n1 0\ne\u2212\u03b1\u03b2N det\n\u2212 e\u03b1\u03b2 \u00db (r) (N\u03b2 /2)\n(12)\ndetD\u03b1(r6=1) =\n2a\n0 1\n\u0014 NY\n\u00151/2\n\u03b2 \u22121\n\u0010 1 \u0011N N\u03b2\ndetD\u03b1(1) =\ne\u2212\u03b1\u03b2N/2\ndet(1 + aM\u0302 (k))\ndet(1 \u2212 e\u03b1\u03b2 V\u0302(N\u03b2 ))\n(13)\na\nk=0\n\nr\u2032 \u02c6\n(r)\n(N\u03b2 /2) on W \u2295 W and\nwhere M\u0302 (k) := 2a\n\u2032 \u2206(k) + m (i.e. the scalar part of D\u0302space (k) + m). The linear maps \u00db\n(r)\nV\u0302(N\u03b2 ) on W in (12)\u2013(13) are defined as follows. Exploiting the periodicity of the link variables to define dj (k) for all\nk \u2208 Z, periodic under k \u2192 k + N\u03b2 , and thereby define D\u0302(r) \u03a8\u0302(k) for all k \u2208 Z , we consider the equation D\u0302(r) \u03a8\u0302(k) = 0\n(r)\n(no periodicity requirement on \u03a8\u0302(k)). In the r 6= 1 case, since the d\u00b11 (k)'s are invertible, it is clear from (11)\nthat solutions \u03a8\u0302(k) are specified by two initial values. Thus the solution space is isomorphic to W \u2295 W . Setting\n\u03a8\u0302\n\u0011 \u03a8\u0302(2n) and\u0010\u03a8\u03022 (n)\u0011= \u03a8\u0302(2n+1) the solutions are determined from their initial values via an evolution operator:\n\u0010 1 (n) =\n\u03a8\u03021 (n)\n\u03a8\u03022 (n)\n\n= \u00db (r) (n)\n\n\u03a8\u03021 (0)\n\u03a8\u03022 (0)\n\n. The operator \u00db (r) (N\u03b2 /2) appearing in (12) can also be characterised as follows: Due to\n(r)\n\nthe N\u03b2 \u2013periodicity of the dj (k)'s in (11) there is a linear map on the solution space defined by \u03a8\u0302(k) 7\u2192 \u03a8\u0302(k + N\u03b2 ),\nor, equivalently, (\u03a8\u03021 (n), \u03a8\u03022 (n)) 7\u2192 (\u03a8\u03021 (n + N\u03b2 /2), \u03a8\u03022 (n + N\u03b2 /2)). This map coincides with \u00db (r) (N\u03b2 /2) when the\nsolution space is identified with W \u2295 W .\nIn the r = 1 case, solutions to D\u0302(1) \u03a8\u0302(k) = 0 are determined by just a single initial value; this is connected with\n(1)\nthe non-invertibility of d\u00b11 (k) and can be seen, e.g., from the expression (16) below. Thus the solution space in\nthis case is isomorphic to W . The evolution operator V\u0302(k) determines solutions from their initial value through\n\u03a8\u0302(k) = V\u0302(k)\u03a8\u0302(0). The V\u0302(N\u03b2 ) in (13) can be alternatively characterised as the linear map on the solution space which\nmaps \u03a8\u0302(k) 7\u2192 \u03a8\u0302(k + N\u03b2 ).\nFinite difference approximations to differential operators in one variable and their determinants have been studied\nin [7,8] and we are going to use a convergence result from there. In the setting of [7,8], specialising to 1st order\ndifferential operator, the operator L and its finite difference approximation L\u0302 have the forms\nL = L1 (\u03c4 )\n\nd\n+ L0 (\u03c4 )\nd\u03c4\n\n,\n\nL\u0302 = L\u03021 (k)\n\n1\n\u2202 + L\u03020 (k)\na\n\n(14)\n\n(\u03c4 \u2208 R , k \u2208 Z) \u2202 \u2208 {\u2202 + , \u2202 \u2212 } , \u2202 + \u03a8\u0302(k) = \u03a8\u0302(k + 1) \u2212 \u03a8\u0302(k) , \u2202 \u2212 \u03a8\u0302(k) = \u03a8\u0302(k) \u2212 \u03a8\u0302(k \u2212 1) , with Lj (\u03c4 ), L\u0302j (k) : W \u2192 W\nbeing periodic under \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03b2 , k \u2192 k + N\u03b2 , respectively, and\n3\n\n\fL\u0302j (k) = Lj (ka) + O(a)\n\n(j = 0, 1).\n\n(15)\n\nThen the solutions to L\u03a8(\u03c4 ) = 0 and L\u0302\u03a8\u0302(k) = 0 are both determined by a single initial value, so the solution spaces\nin both cases are isomorphic to W . Solutions \u03a8\u0302 approximate solutions \u03a8 , i.e. if \u03a8\u0302(0) = \u03a8(0) then \u03a8\u0302(k) \u2248 \u03a8(ka) for\nsmall a. Consequently the\nR evolution operator \u00db (k) for L\u0302\u03a8\u0302 = 0 approximates the evolution operator U(\u03c4 ) for L\u03a8 = 0.\n(Explicitly, U(\u03c4 ) = T e\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c4\n\n0\n\nL1 (t)\u22121 L0 (t) dt\n\n.) In particular one has the following (cf. \u00a73 of [8]):\n\nConvergence Theorem: \u00db(N\u03b2 ) \u2192 U(\u03b2) for a \u2192 0 with aN\u03b2 = \u03b2 held fixed.\n\nAn obvious variant of this which we will make use of is the following. If p is a multiple of N\u03b2 and L\u0302 = L\u03021\n\n1\npa\n\n\u2202 + L\u03020\n\nwith the L\u0302j (k)'s periodic under k \u2192 k +N\u03b2 /p and satisfying L\u0302j (k) = Lj (kpa)+O(a) (j = 0, 1) then \u00db (N\u03b2 /p) \u2192 U(\u03b2)\nfor a \u2192 0. Furthermore, if \u0010W is \u0011replaced by W1 \u2295 W2 in the preceding then the convergence theorem continues to\nhold when \u2202 is replaced by \u22020 \u22020 \u0303 with \u2202, \u2202 \u0303 \u2208 {\u2202 + , \u2202 \u2212 }.\n\nIn order to apply the convergence theorem to evaluate the a \u2192 0 limits of (12)\u2013(13) we need to rewrite D\u0302(r) in the\nform of L\u0302 in (14), or its aforementioned variant. We have only been able to do this in the r = 0 and r = 1 cases. The\n(r)\nbeyond\nproblem of evaluating lima\u21920 detD\u03b1 in the general r case therefore remains for future work; new techniques\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1 0\nthose of [7,8] may be required for this. In the r = 1 case we specialise to a \u03b3-representation where \u03b34 = 0 \u22121 and\ndecompose W = W+ \u2295 W\u2212 so that \u03b34 = \u00b11 on W\u00b1 .

Using this and noting\ndet(1 + aM\u0302 (k)) = e aT r M\u0302 (k) + O(a2 ) the a \u2192 0 limit of (13) is now obtained:\nR\u03b2\n\u0010 1 \u0011N N\u03b2\nT r M(\u03c4 ) d\u03c4\n\u2212\u03b1\u03b2N/2+ 21\n0\nlim detD\u03b1(1) =\ndet(1 \u2212 e\u03b1\u03b2 V(\u03b2))\n(20)\ne\na\u21920\na\nThe gauge field-independent factor 1/aN N\u03b2 , which diverges in the a \u2192 0 limit, is physically inconsequential; it can at\nmost give rise to an overall constant shift in the calculation of certain physical quantities (such as the energy density\nin finite temperature QCD).\nAn application of the zeta-regularised determinant formula for differential operators in one variable, Theorem 1 of\n[7], leads to an expression for det\u03b6 D\u03b1 which coincides with (20) without the 1/aN N\u03b2 factor and with M (\u03c4 ) replaced\nby \u00b1M (\u03c4 ) (the details of this are given in [5]). The sign \u00b1 depends on the choice of cut in the complex plane used\n(1)\nto define the zeta-determinant. Choosing this so that the sign is \"+\" we then have lima\u21920 aN N\u03b2 detD\u03b1 = det\u03b6 D\u03b1\nwhich establishes the first part of (10).\nIn the r = 0 case, with \u03a8\u0302 represented by (\u03a8\u03021 (n), \u03a8\u03022 (n)) as before, we have\n\u0012 +\n\u0013\n\u2202\n0\n(0)\n(0) 1\n+ L\u03020\n(21)\nD\u0302(0) = L\u03021\n2a\n0 \u2202\u2212\nwhere\n\n4\n\n\f(0)\nL\u03021 (n)\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\nJ\u02c61 (n)\n0\nK\u03021 (n)\n0\n\n,\n\n(0)\nL\u03020 (n)\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\nDspace (2na) + m\nK\u03020 (n)\nDspace ((2n + 1)a) + m\nJ\u02c60 (n)\n\n\u0013\n\nJ\u02c61 (n) = \u03b34 U4 ((2n \u2212 1)a)\u22121 , K\u03021 (n) = \u03b34 U4 ((2n + 1)a)\n\u0011\n\u0011\n1 \u0010\n1 \u0010\nJ\u02c60 (n) = \u03b34\n,\nK\u03020 (n) = \u03b34\nU4 (2na) \u2212 U4 ((2n \u2212 1)a)\u22121\nU4 ((2n + 1)a) \u2212 U4 (2na)\u22121\n2a\n2a\n\n(22)\n(23)\n(24)\n\n(0)\n\nClearly L\u0302j (n) is periodic under n \u2192 n + N\u03b2 /2 and\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\nDspace (2na) + m\n\u03b34 A4 (2na)\n0 \u03b34\n(0)\n(0)\n+ O(a) ,\nL\u03020 (n) =\nL\u03021 (n) =\n+ O(a) .\n\u03b34 A4 (2na)\nDspace (2na) + m\n\u03b34 0\n\n(25)\n\nThe convergence\ntheorem then gives lima\u21920 \u00db (N\u03b2 /2) = U(\u03b2) where U(\u03b2), acting on W \u2295W , is the evolution operator\n\u0010 \u0011\n\u03a81\ne\n(\u03c4 ) = 0 with\nfor D\n\u03a82\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0012\n\nd\nDspace (\u03c4 ) + m \u03b34 ( d\u03c4\n+ A4 (\u03c4 ))\nd\n\u03b34 ( d\u03c4 + A4 (\u03c4 )) Dspace (\u03c4 ) + m\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(26)\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\ne O = (\u03b34 \u03b35 )\u22121 D (\u03b34 \u03b35 ) 0 , where D is\non W \u2295 W , we find after a little calculation O\u22121 D\n0\nD\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u22121\n(\u03b34 \u03b35 )\n0\nthe Dirac operator (7).

After noting det(1 \u2212 e\u03b1\u03b2 V(\u03b2)) = det(1 + e\u03b2\u03bc e\u2212\u03b2H ) where\n\u2202\nlogZ (with \u03b2\u03bc\nH = \u03b34 (Dspace + m) it is easy to check that physical quantities such as the mean energy hEi = \u2212 \u2202\u03b2\nheld constant) calculated from the expressions in this paper are consistent with the standard results described, e.g.,\nP r\u2032\nin [9]. One subtlety is that in the r = 1 case lima\u21920 hEi has an additional shift of \u22122 p ( 2a\n\u2032 \u2206space (p) + m) due\nto the exponential factor in (20), while such a shift does not occur in the r = 0 case (cf. (27)). This shift can also\nbe seen from the standard calculation in \u00a718.11 of [9]: There the computation is reduced to a weighted sum of the\nresidues of a certain function g(z)/z. In addition to the poles at z = z\u00b1 discussed there, there is also a pole at z = 0\nand its residue is readily seen to give the aforementioned shift in lima\u21920 hEi. In the r = 0 case there is no pole at\nz = 0 and hence no corrsponding shift in that case.\nWe have considered only the simplest lattice fermion formulations in this paper, namely the naive and Wilson\nfermions (with the connection to staggered fermions due to the relation between the naive and staggered fermion\ndeterminants). More recent formulations of major current interest are the domain wall [10] and overlap [11] fermions,\nas well as other chirally improved approaches to lattice fermions [13]. It appears feasible to evaluate the continuous\ntime limit of the domain wall fermion determinant (with finite, discretised fifth dimension) along the same lines as\nhere; this is currently under investigation. Doing this in the case of overlap fermions seems more technically difficult\nthough. We remark that the overlap fermion determinant has previously been successfully tested (in both the chiral\nand vector cases) against known continuum expressions in 2 dimensions [12].\nI thank Pierre van Baal and Claude Bernard for useful discussions and feedback.
