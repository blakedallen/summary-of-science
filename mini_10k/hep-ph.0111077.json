The fa torised model. In this approa h one assumes that fa torisation [7\u2104\n\nan be\n\napplied to the pro ess, just as in in lusive hard s attering pro esses, modulo an\noverall multipli ative fa tor whi h has\n\nome to be\n\nalled the \u0010gap survival prob-\n\nability\u0011 [8\u2104. Following Ingelman and S hlein (IS), one\n\nan go further and assume\n\nso- alled \u0010Regge Fa torisation\u0011 [9\u2104 whi h assumes that the pro ess is driven by\npomeron ex hange, as illustrated in Figure 1. Thus one assigns an experimentally\ndetermined parton density and \u001dux fa tor to the ex hanged pomeron [4\u2104.\n\nIt is\n\nexpe ted that this fa torisation will be violated at the Tevatron [2, 7, 10, 11\u2104 and\nthe extent to whi h the breaking\n\nan be a\n\nommodated, at some level, by a gap\n\nsurvival fa tor is very mu h an open question. Central dijet produ tion within a\nfa torised model has been studied before [3, 2, 12\u2104.\n2. The non-fa torised model. These models have been developed in [10, 13, 14, 15\u2104.\nThey are ex lusive in the sense that all energy lost by the intera ting hadrons goes\ninto the \u001cnal state dijets. Therefore we will see no pomeron remnants in the \u001cnal\n\n1\n\nstate, as illustrated in Figure 2 . This feature would manifest itself as a peak in\nthe distribution showing the fra tion of the available\n\nentre-of-mass energy whi h\n\ngoes into the jets; a feature whi h is absent in the CDF data. However this need\nnot be the\n\nase for Tevatron Run II whi h ought to be a good pla e to look for\n\neviden e of a non-fa torised\n\nontribution.

We have extended previous\n\nal ulations by in luding\n\nthe e\u001be ts of parton showering and hadronisation and found that they lead to a suppression of the\n\nross-se tion relative to the naive parton level by a fa tor of around 4. We also\n\nfound that, in the kinemati\n\nregion probed by the Tevatron, the e\u001be t of non-di\u001bra tive\n\n(reggeon) ex hange is probably important. At the present time the issue of gap survival\nis not very well understood. However, it is en ouraging that we are able to des ribe the\ndata with a gap survival probability of around 10% whi h is\n\nonsistent with previous\n\ntheoreti al estimates.\nWe would like to thank Arjun Berera, Brian Cox, Dino Goulianos, Christophe Royon and\nMike Seymour.\n\nThis work was supported by the UK Parti le Physi s and Astronomy\n\nResear h Coun il.\n\nReferen es\n[1\u2104 T.
