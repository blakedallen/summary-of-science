A possibility of ferromagnetism in quark matter has been first suggested by one of the authors (T.T.)\nby the use of the OGE interaction;2) a trade-off between the kinetic and the Fock\nexchange energies gives rise to spin polarization, similar to Bloch's idea for itinerant\nelectrons.3), 4) Salient features of spin polarization in the relativistic system are also\ndiscussed in Ref. 2).\nIf these phases are realized in quark matter, there should be some interplay between them; we examine here a possibility of the coexistence of FM and CSC in quark\nmatter. It would be worth mentioning in this context that ferromagnetism (or spin\npolarization) and superconductivity are fundamental concepts in condensed matter\nphysics, and their coexistent phase has been discussed for a long time.5) As a recent\nprogress, a superconducting phase have been discovered in ferromagnetic materials\n\u2217)\n\u2217\u2217)\n\u2217\u2217\u2217)\n\nE-mail: tatsumi@ruby.scphys.kyoto-u.ac.jp\nE-mail: tomo@brs.nihon-u.ac.jp\nE-mail: enakano@comp.metro-u.ac.jp\n\n\f2\n\nT. Tataumi, T. Maruyama and E. Nakano\n\nand many efforts have been made to understand the coexisting mechanism.6)\nIn a phenomenological context their coexistence should have some implications\nfor the magnetic and thermal properties of compact stars. Recently, a new type of\nneutron stars, called \"magnetars\", with a super strong magnetic field of \u223c O(1015 G)\nhas been discovered.7) They may remind us of a long-standing problem about the\norigin of the magnetic field in compact stars, since its strength is too large to regard it\nas a successor from progenitor main-sequence stars, unlike canonical neutron stars.8)\nSince hadronic matter develops over inside neutron stars beyond the nuclear density\n(\u03c10 \u223c0.16fm\u22123 ), it should be interesting to consider the microscopic origin of the\nmagnetic field in magnetars.\nThus, it might be also interesting to examine the possibility of the spin-polarized\nphase with CSC in quark matter, in connection with magnetars.\nWe investigate spin polarization in the color superconducting phase by a selfconsistent framework, in which quark Cooper pairs are formed under the axial-vector\nmean-field. We shall see that this phenomenon is a manifestation of spontaneous\nbreaking of both color SU (3) and rotation symmetries.\n\u00a72.\n\nFerromagnetism in quark matter\n\nA possibility of FM in quark matter has been first suggested by a perturbative calculation with the one-gluon-exchange (OGE) interaction:2) the mechanism\nof spontaneous spin polarization of quark matter is caused by the Fock exchange interaction, since quark matter is globally color neutral system, which is analogous to\nthat due to itinerant electrons in condensed matter physics.3), 4) One of the important features there is that there is no spin independent interaction ab initio, while the\nspin polarization occurs as a consequence of the Pauli exclusion principle: electrons\nwith the same spin direction can effectively avoid the Coulomb repulsion. Since a\nquark should be treated relativistically and no more eigenstate of the spin operator\n\u03a3z , we must carefully define \"ferromagnetism\" in quark matter.2)\nBy operating the Fierz transformation on the original Lagrangian, we can extract\nthe relevant Fock interaction to magnetism: we shall see the condensation of the\naxial-vector mean-field (AV), h\u03c8\u0304\u03b35 \u03b33 \u03c8i, is a key phenomenon.9) It is well known\nthat any non-vanishing mean-field, h\u03c8\u0304\u0393\u03b1 \u03c8i, implies the importance of the particlehole (or anti-particle) degree of freedom.\nTaking AV in the form,\nV = \u2212\u03b35 \u03b33 UA , UA //\u1e91,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwithout loss of generality, we have the quark Green function in the presence of AV,\np \u2212 m \u2212 /\u03bc + \u03b35 /UA .\nG\u22121\nA (p) = /\n\n(2.2)\n\nThe particle spectrum is then easily obtained by seeking for the poles of the Green\nfunction GA (p), det G\u22121\nA (p0 = \u01ebn )|\u03bc=0 = 0, for uniform magnetization:\n\u01ebn = \u00b1\u01eb\u00b1\n\n(2.3)\n\n\fFerromagnetism and Superconductivity in Quark Matter\n\u01eb\u00b1 =\n\nr\n\nq\np2 + U2A + m2 \u00b1 2 m2 U2A + (p * UA )2 ,\n\n3\n(2.4)\n\npz\n\nwhere the sign \u00b1 in \u01eb\u00b1 represents an exchange splitting of different \"spin\" eigenp2\n\u00b1 |UA | in the\nstates.4) The spectrum is reduced to a familiar form \u01eb\u00b1 \u223c m + 2m\n4)\nnon-relativistic limit. In the massless limit, on the other hand, \u01eb\u00b1 \u2192 [p2\u22a5 + (|pz | \u00b1\n|UA |)2 ]1/2 , which is nothing else but the free-particle energy with a shift of the z\ncomponent of momentum, and UA becomes a redundant degree of freedom. We\ncan immediately see that there appears a coupling term in \u01eb\u00b1 , \u221d p * UA , reflecting that the direction of spin changes as a particle moves in the relativistic case.\nThus we must consider the spin configuration in the phase space, different\nfrom the non-relativistic case like the\nHeisenberg model.\nThe system loses rotation sym0\nmetry in the momentum space as well\nas in the coordinate space due to the\npresence of AV (O(3) \u2192 O(2)), so\nthat the Fermi sea is deformed in\nthe relativistic case. Consequently we\np\nhave two deformed Fermi seas with\nFig. 1. Schematic view of the shapes of the Fermi\ndifferent volumes: one (F \u2212 ) has a\nseas: a prolate shape for majority \"spin\"\nprolate shape for majority particles\nquarks (F \u2212 ) and an oblate shape for minority\n+\nand the other (F ) an oblate shape\n\"spin\" quarks (F + ).\n\u2217)\nfor minority particles.\nThe mean-value of the spin operator is then given by\nZ\nd4 p\n1\ntr\u03b35 \u03b33 GA (p)\ns\u0304z = h\u03a3z i = \u2212i\n4\n2\nC (2\u03c0)\n\u0015\n\u0014Z\nZ\n1\nd3 p |UA | \u2212 \u03b2\nd3 p |UA | + \u03b2\n=\n+\n(2.5)\n3\n2 F + (2\u03c0)3\n\u01eb+\n\u01eb\u2212\nF \u2212 (2\u03c0)\np\nwith \u03b2 = p2z + m2 , and we can obviously see that the nonvanishing value of |UA |\ncauses finite magnetization.\nx,y\n\n\u00a73.\n\nColor magnetic superconductivity\n\nHere let's tackle the coexistence problem of FM and CSC, a possibility of color\nmagnetic superconductivity;11) more definitely, our main concern here is to examine\nthe possibility of the quark Cooper instability under AV in Eq. (2.1), which is responsible for spin polarization of quark matter. In other words we'd like to figure\n\u2217)\n\nIt would be interesting to see a similar idea given in ref. 10); these authors variationally\nintroduced the deformed Fermi seas in the context of the gap function of CSC for a pair with\ndifferent Fermi surfaces.

In general we must take into account these self-energies in V , V = Us +\n\u03bc\n3 in\n\u03b35 Ups + \u03b3\u03bc Uv\u03bc + \u03b3\u03bc \u03b35 Uav\nwith the mean-fields Ui . Here we retain only Us , Uv0 , Uav\nV and suppose that others to be vanished.\nWe shall see this ansatz gives self-consistent solutions for Eq.(3.5) because of\naxial and reflection symmetries of the Fermi seas under the zero-range approximation\nfor the gluon propagator (see \u00a73.1). We furthermore discard the scalar mean-field\nUs and the time component of the vector mean-field Uv0 for simplicity since they are\ndirectly irrelevant for the spin degree of freedom.\nHere we take the following ansatz for V and \u2206: V has a form given in Eq.

The structure of the gap function (3 7) is inspired by a physical consideration of\na quark pair on the same Fermi surface of F \u2212 or F + :11) we consider here the quark\npair on each Fermi surface with opposite momenta, p and \u2212p so that they result\n \u0303s is still a matrix in the\nin a linear combination of J \u03c0 = 0\u2212 , 1\u2212 (see Fig. 3). \u2217) \u2206\ncolor-flavor space and we take\n\u0010 \u0011\n \u0303s\n\u2206\n= \u01eb\u03b1\u03b23 \u01ebij \u2206s\n(3.8)\n\u03b1\u03b2;ij\n\nto satisfy the fermionic constraint for the two-flavor case (2SC), where \u03b1, \u03b2 denote\nthe color indices and i, j the flavor indices.

The middle two figures show diffusion of the Fermi surfaces in the presence of the\npolar-angle dependent gap function \u2206\u00b1 .\n\nfunctions have nodes at poles (\u03b8 = 0, \u03c0) and take the maximal values at the vicinity\nof equator (\u03b8 = \u03c0/2), keeping the relation, \u2206\u2212 & \u2206+ (Fig. 3). This feature is\nvery similar to the 3 P pairing in liquid 3 He or nuclear matter;13), 14) actually we can\nsee our gap function Eq. (3.12) to exhibit an effective P wave nature by a genuine\nrelativistic effect due to the Dirac spinors. To summarize, we depict in Fig. (3) the\ndeformed Fermi seas for \u2206\u00b1 = 0 and the quasi-particle distributions for \u2206\u00b1 6= 0.\nWe also find that the expression for UA , Eq. (3.11), is nothing but the simple\nsum of the expectation value of the spin operator with the weight of the occupation\nprobability of the quasi-particles vs2 for two colors and the step function for remaining\none color (cf. (2.5)).\n\n\fFerromagnetism and Superconductivity in Quark Matter\n\n7\n\n3.1. Self-consistent solutions\nHere we demonstrate some numerical results; we replaced the original OGE by\nthe \"contact\" interaction with the cutoff around the Fermi surface in the momentum\nspace,\n(3.13)\n\nD \u03bc\u03bd \u2192 \u2212g \u03bc\u03bd /\u039b2 , \u2206s (p) \u2192 \u2206s (p)\u03b8(\u03b4 \u2212 |\u01ebs \u2212 \u03bc|)\n\nas in the BCS theory in the weak-coupling limit.\nFirst we show the magnitude of AV. It is seen that the axial-vector mean-field\n(spin polarization) appears above a critical density and becomes larger as baryon\nnumber density gets higher. Moreover, the results for different values of the quark\nmass show that spin polarization grows more for the larger quark mass. This is\nbecause a large quark mass gives rise to much difference in the Fermi seas of two\ndifferent \"spin\" states, which leads to growth of the exchange energy in the axialvector channel. A slight reduction of UA arises as a result of diffuseness of the\nFermi surface due to \u2206s . As seen in Eq. (3.11), UA can be obtained as addition\nand cancellation of the contributions by two different Fermi seas; the latter term is\nmore momentum dependent than the former one and thereby vs2 (p) enhances the\ncancellation term (see Fig. 4).\n(a)\n\nm = 16 MeV\n\nUA (MeV)\n\n30\n20\n\nm = 15 MeV\n\n10\nNormal\nSuper\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\nm = 14 MeV\n\n10\n\n15\n\n10\n8\n\n(b)\n\n\u3008\u2206\u00b1 \u3009 (GeV)\n\nUA (MeV)\n\n200\n\nm = 25 MeV\n\n150\n100\nm = 20 MeV\n\n6\n4\n\u2206+ (m=15 MeV)\n\u2206 - (m=15 MeV)\n\n2\n\n\u2206+ (m=20 MeV)\n\u2206 - (m=20 MeV)\n\n50\n\n0\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n\u03c1B/\u03c10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\u03c1B/\u03c10\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\nFig. 4.

Solid (dashed) lines denote AV in the presence (absence) of CSC; (Right panel)\nMean value of the gap functions.\n\nNext we show the gap function as a function of \u03c1B . To see the bulk behavior\nof the gap function, we use the mean-value with respect to the polar angle on the\n\u00011/2\nR\u03c0\nFermi surface, h\u2206\u00b1 i \u2261 0 d\u03b8 sin \u03b8\u22062\u00b1 /2\n. The mean values h\u2206\u00b1 i begin to split\nat a certain density where UA becomes finite.\nWith these figures we can say that FM and CSC barely interfere with each other.\n\n\f8\n\nT. Tataumi, T. Maruyama and E. Nakano\n\u00a74.\n\nSummary and concluding remarks\n\nWe have discussed color magnetic superconductivity with a simple model and\nfound that the coexistence of FM and CSC is possible, while CSC somewhat suppresses FM.\nWe can still expect a high magnetic field enough to explain BMAX \u223c 1015 G\nobserved in magnetars, while the magnitude of polarization is not so large (\u223c several\n%).\nThrough numerical calculations we used the constant quark masses by regarding\nthem as input parameters and studied the mass effect on the present problem. We\nfound that the quark mass is very important to realize, especially, FM, and a larger\nquark mass favors spontaneous magnetization. Once taking into account the restoration of chiral symmetry at a certain density, we must allow a dynamical change of\nthe quark mass. This subject is under progress.15)\nFinally it would be worth mentioning related other works. As a recent progress\nin CSC, some authors considered S = 1 pairing as well as a usual one,16) which also\nexhibits an polar-angle dependence of the gap function. However, its magnitude is\nmuch less than the usual one. Note that there is only one type of pairing in our case.\nWe hope this work serves as an impetus for further study on color magnetic\nsuperconductivity.\nAcknowledgements\nThe present work of T.T. and T.M. is partially supported by the Japanese Grantin-Aid for Scientific Research Fund of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports,\nScience and Technology (11640272, 13640282), and by the REIMEI Research Resources of Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI).\nReferences\n1) B.
