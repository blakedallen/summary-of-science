INTRODUCTION\n\nSince the discovery of the first pulsar, radio observations have steadily revealed a wide range of fast (.\n1s) transient phenomena. Pulsars (Hewish et al. 1968;\nBacker et al. 1982; Camilo et al. 2006), planets and active stars (Hallinan et al. 2007; Griessmeier et al. 2007),\nand peculiar new transients (McLaughlin et al. 2006;\nLorimer et al. 2007) all have distinct radio phenomenology related to the physics of the host and the medium\nthrough which the signal propagates.\nWhile large, single-dish telescopes have pioneered the\nstudy of fast radio transients, the nature of their design\nhas several limits. Single-dish telescopes can only localize\nan individual pulse to somewhere in its field of view (typically arcminutes; Manchester et al. 2001). Timing of periodic emission can localize very precisely, but individual\npulses can't be localized well enough to easily identify\noptical or X-ray counterparts. Since interferometers simultaneously have a large collecting area and a large\nfield of view, they survey more efficiently than singledish telescopes. Survey speed scales roughly the square\nof the product of the number of dishes and their diameter; this predicts that the VLA surveys almost 40 times\nfaster than the Green Bank Telescope, assuming all other\nfactors are equal. Despite this potential, next-generation\nradio interferometers (VLA, PAPER, LOFAR, ASKAP,\nand MeerKAT) have fast transients observing modes that\nare essentially identical to the single-dish concept: point\none or more beams on the sky and search for pulses\n(Macquart 2011; Siemion et al. 2011).\nIn principle, interferometers have much more information available to them because they detect the electromagnetic wave over a distributed array of receivers. In-\n\nstead of forming a beam, interferometers can measure\nvisibilities by correlating signals across the array. Visibilities contain spatial information that can reject interference and localize a source to arcsecond precision over a\nlarge field of view. Traditionally, visibilities haven't been\nused in this way because it was difficult to run correlators\nthis fast and the data volume was too large to handle or\nefficiently search for pulses (Law et al. 2011). As a result,\na standard radio interferometer averages data to second\ntime scales, losing nearly all information about millisecond variability in the sky. Even on these longer time\nscales, imaging algorithms are complex and subject to\nsubtle statistical biases (Condon et al. 1998). The challenge of data rates and volumes is expected to grow with\nnext-generation interferometers, which will have more\nantennas, wider bandwidths, and larger fields of view\n(Perley et al. 2011).\nHere, we present a technique that reduces the challenge\nof detecting transients in visibilities to the much simpler\nsingle-dish problem, while maintaining the utility of visibilities. The technique is based on the \"bispectrum\",\na quantity formed from visibilities that is sensitive to a\npoint source anywhere in the field of view (Cornwell 1987;\nKulkarni 1989; Rogers et al. 1995). Differencing visibilities makes it possible to interpret the bispectrum as a\nstatistic for transients anywhere in the field of view on\ntime scales from milliseconds to seconds. We describe an\nalgorithm for real-time, arcsecond localization of transients using raw visibilities from a radio interferometer.\nThe theory of closure quantities and their application\nto transients is presented in \u00a72. In \u00a73 we test the theoretical predictions with millisecond time scale visibilities\nfrom the VLA and the \"Pocket Correlator\" (PoCo) in-\n\n\f2\nstrument at the ATA (Law et al. 2011). As shown in \u00a74,\nthis technique has a moderate computational demand\nand can reduce the flow of data to a manageable size.\nWe conclude with thoughts about new science accessible\nwith this technique and how it can address the growing\nchallenge of big data in the study of transients with radio\ninterferometers.\n2. THEORY OF TRANSIENT DETECTION WITH THE\nBISPECTRUM\n\nClosure quantities are the combination of visibilities\nfrom antennas that form a closed loop (Cornwell 1987).\nAn example of a closure quantity is the closure phase\nor triple phase, which is the sum of the visibility phase\nfrom three baselines, \u03c6ijk = \u03c6ij + \u03c6jk + \u03c6ki . This combination is useful because it is independent of phase errors\nassociated with any individual antenna. Closure quantities have largely been developed for very long baseline\ninterferometry, because they make it possible to detect a\nsource even if phase calibration is unstable (Rogers et al.\n1995). An interesting corollary is that the triple phase\nresponds in the same way to a point source anywhere in\nthe field of view.\nA related closure quantity is the product of visibilities\non a closed loop, called the closure triple or bispectrum.\nThe bispectrum can be written as bijk = aij ajk aki ei\u03c6ijk ,\nwhere aij are the amplitudes of visibilities for baseline ij.\nIn the absence of signal, the bispectra have a mean at the\norigin of the real-imaginary plane with variance proportional to the cube of the thermal noise. A celestial point\nsource is coherent across the array and moves all bispectra to positive real values proportional to the cube of\nits brightness (Kulkarni 1989; Rogers et al. 1995). This\nmakes the bispectrum useful for the statistical detection\nof a source anywhere in the field of view.\nAn interferometer can detect sources with a low signal to noise ratio (SNR) per baseline, s, by coherently\ncombining signals over many baselines. For a homogeneous array of na elements, there are nbl = na (na \u2212 1)/2\nindependent baselines, so\u221acoherently combining all baselines improves SNR to s nbl . For combinations of three\nantennas, there are ntr = na (na \u2212 1)(na \u2212 2)/6 closed\npossibilities. It can be shown that some triple phases are\nredundant (e.g., \u03c6123 = \u03c6124 + \u03c6143 + \u03c6234 ), which leaves\nonly (na \u2212 1) (na \u2212 2)/2 \"unique\" triples (Rogers et al.\n1995). However, the bispectrum is subject to different\ncorrelated noise properties, since it is formed by multiplying complex visibilities rather than summing scalar\nphases. As a result, in the limit of small s, all ntr triples\nare independent (Kulkarni 1989) and can be coherently\ncombined to improve SNR.\nInterferometers can detect a source in many ways.\nCoherent beamforming sums complex visibilities with\nweights to direct the beam 1 . Antenna-based incoherent beamforming sums the power detected at each antenna, while baseline-based beamforming sums power detected on each baseline (i.e., the amplitude of a visibility; Thompson et al. 2001). In all of these cases, the\nSNR of a source detection can be written in terms of the\nSNR per baseline and size of the array (Kulkarni 1989;\nRogers et al. 1995). The SNR for coherent beamforming,\n1 In this context, one can think of imaging as coherently beamforming all possible beams.\n\nbispectrum, antenna-based incoherent beamforming, and\nbaseline-based incoherent beamforming are:\n\u221a\nSNRbfc = s nbl ,\n1 \u221a\nSNRbisp = s3 ntr ,\n2\u221a\nSNRbfia = s na ,\n\u221a\n1\ns2\nnbl\n(1)\nSNRbfib = \u221a\n2\n2 1+s\nNote that for constant sources, the relation for SNRbisp\nis only valid when s is smaller than 1 (Kulkarni 1989).\nHowever, for transient sources the noise is measured off\npulse. This removes the correlated noise effect and makes\nthe s3 scaling valid for all s. We refer to these relations as\nthe \"apparent SNR\", since they are valid when the statistics are measured relative to the standard deviation off\nsource. For Gaussian statistics, the apparent\nSNR\nre\u0010\n\u0010 is \u0011\u0011\nSNR\n1\nlated to the false positive rate as 2 \u2217 1 \u2212 erf \u221a2\n(Rogers et al. 1995); a 5\u03c3 deviation corresponds to a\nfalse-positive rate of 2.87 \u00d7 10\u22127 .\nAn important complication to this SNR analysis is\nthat an individual bispectrum measurement is not Gaussian distributed. Visibilities are Gaussian distributed,\nso multiplying three, noise-like complex visibilities together produces a long-tailed distribution. The product\nof three independent real -valued random variables follows the Meier G function G3,0\n0,3 (Lomnicki 1967); we are\nnot aware of an analytic expression for the real part of the\nproduct of three complex random variables. Regardless\nof the exact distribution, the Central Limit Theorem predicts that the mean of many, independent bispectra will\napproach a Gaussian distribution (Rogers et al. 1995).\nIn the presence of pure noise, each bispectrum in an array is independent (Kulkarni 1989), so the distribution\nof the mean bispectrum will approach a Gaussian as the\nnumber of elements in the array grows, as shown in Figure 1.\nTo include this effect in our sensitivity calculation, we\nsimulated noise-like visibilities and directly measured the\nflux limit of the coherent beamforming and bispectrum\nstatistics as a function of array size, na . The flux limit is\nquantified by calculating s (from Equations 1) that would\nproduce the simulated 5\u03c3 false-positive rate under Gaussian statistics. This simulation shows that the flux limit\nof coherent beamforming matches the expectation for a\nGaussian-distributed quantity. However, the mean bispectrum has a larger false-positive rate than expected for\nan apparent 5\u03c3 deviation, especially for small na where\nthe Central Limit Theorem has less effect. We use these\nsimulations to define an effective bispectrum 5\u03c3 flux limit\nthat produces the Gaussian false-positive rate. The effective 5\u03c3 flux limit is higher than predicted by Gaussian statistics at a level of 53%, 26%, 13%, and 6% for\nna = 3, 6, 12, 24, respectively. For this work, we assume\nthe mean bispectrum is Gaussian distributed, which is\nreasonable for arrays larger than a roughly a dozen elements for a 5\u03c3 flux limit. Future work will develop a\nmore general expression for the false-positive rate and optimizations for transient detection in the non-Gaussian\ndomain.\nFigure 2 shows how the apparent SNR of four techniques scales with SNR per baseline for a 27-element ar-\n\n\f3\n\nFig. 1.- Simulated histograms of the noise distribution of the\nreal part of the mean bispectrum. Each bispectrum is calculated by\nmultiplying random complex visibilities for an array of na antennas producing nbl independent visibilities. The real and imaginary\nparts of the visibilities are sampled from a Gaussian with standard\ndeviation of 1 and mean of 0. The mean bispectrum for na = 3\n(the smallest array with a bispectrum) is centrally peaked with long\ntails. For larger arrays, the distribution of the mean bispectrum\nnarrows and approaches that of a Gaussian, as expected from the\nCentral Limit Theorem. The distribution can also be used to estimate the false-positive rate for a signal of a given apparent SNR.\n\nray like the VLA. The apparent bispectrum SNR scales\nas s3 , giving it a strong response to bright sources and\nvery little response to faint sources. However, the effective bispectrum SNR, defined according to a Gaussian false-positive rate, would be less sensitive for large\ns. Our simulations suggest that the effective bispectrum\nSNR never exceeds that of coherent beamforming.\nThe bottom panel of Figure 2 shows the effective 5\u03c3\nflux limit for an array with na elements and sensitivity\nlike the VLA. For the beamforming techniques, this plot\nessentially shows how the lines in the top panel intersect\nSNR = 5 as the array size changes. For the bispectrum,\nthe effective flux limit is shown by correcting for sensitivity loss due to non-Gaussianity, as measured in our\nsimulations. Generally, since large arrays are sensitive\nto pulses with SNR per baseline much less than one, coherent beamforming and imaging become more sensitive\nthan the bispectrum as na increases. For large na , the\nbispectrum and incoherent beamforming techniques scale\n\u22121/2\nsimilarly (s \u221d na ), so the bispectrum is always more\nsensitive than the incoherent techniques.\nTo interpret the bispectrum as the brightness of a transient requires subtracting the signature of constant emission from the visibilities. Proper subtraction requires\nthat the visibility fringe does not change over background\nsubtraction time. The maximum fringe rate is equal to\nthe product of the rate of change of the longest baseline in the (u,v ) plane and the largest direction cosine.\nIn units of radians per day, the maximum fringe rate is\n\u03c0 bmax \u03b8f.o.v./\u03bb, where bmax is the longest baseline, \u03b8f.o.v.\nis the field of view in radians, and \u03bb is the wavelength.\nMore precisely, the error from subtracting visibilities\nleaves residual errors proportional to the brightness of\nsources in the field. Thompson et al. (2001) quantify the\neffect of time smearing as a reduction in the peak brightness of a source. For small changes, we can parametrize\n\nFig. 2.- Top: Apparent SNR for coherent beamforming, bispectrum, and incoherent beamforming techniques as a function of\nSNR per baseline for a 27-element array. For an effective SNR,\ndefined according to the false-positive rate, the bispectrum SNR\nnever exceeds that of coherent beamforming. Bottom: The effective 5\u03c3 flux limits as a function of the number of antennas. The\neffective bispectrum flux limit includes a correction due to nonGaussianity. The text marks the sizes of major new and planned\nobservatories, including LOFAR (Stappers et al. 2011), MeerKAT\n(Booth et al. 2009), and ASKAP (Johnston et al. 2008). This assumes Stokes I detection with a SEFD of 400 Jy, 1 GHz bandwidth,\nand 10 ms integrations, which gives a 1\u03c3 sensitivity of 63 mJy per\nbaseline. For reference, the VLA 5\u03c3 10-ms sensitivity is 17 mJy\nfor coherent beamforming, 38 mJy for the bispectrum, 50 mJy for\nbaseline incoherent, and 85 mJy for antenna incoherent detection.\n\nthis in terms of a 1.4 GHz VLA A configuration observation:\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u00152\n\u0014\u0010 \u0011 \u0012\n\u03b8f.o.v\nbmax\n\u03c4\nSop \u2212 S p\n\u22124\n(2)\n= 6 \u00d7 10\nSop\n1s\n0.\u25e6 5\n36km\nwhere \u03c4 is the integration time scale.\nFor visibility (or image) subtraction, the peak flux lost\nfrom time smearing is similar to the flux residual in the\ndifferenced data given by Equation 2. This error will\ncontribute to the mean bispectrum in proportion to the\nfraction of all triples that contain the long baseline. A\nsingle antenna is part of (na \u2212 1) (na \u2212 2)/2 triples, so\n\n\f4\nerrors for a long baseline are suppressed by the fraction\nof triples with that baseline, or a factor of 3/na . Table\n1 gives the longest time scale for which the bispectrum\ntechnique can be used on several radio interferometers.\nThe time scale shows when the systematic errors introduced by background subtraction biases the mean bispectrum more than its thermal noise (1\u03c3). This shows\nthat most interferometers are suitable for using the bispectrum technique to search for transients as long as 1\nsecond. The VLBA is so extended that the fringe rate\ncan only be subtracted on millisecond time scales2 .\nThe bispectrum also contains information about the\nspatial distribution of emission. For a point source with\nlarge s, the\n\u221a standard deviation of complex bispectra\nis \u03c3B = 3 s2 Q3 , where Q is the noise per baseline\n(Kulkarni 1989). Note that the standard deviation of\nbispectra is subject to correlated noise, as opposed to\nthe standard deviation of the mean bispectrum in time.\nIn contrast with a celestial source, interference is often in\nthe near-field or subject to multipath propagation, which\nproduces a random triple phase and a larger variance between bispectra. Another way to think about this is that\nterrestrial interference can look like a spatially-extended\ntransient. The variance between bispectra provides a\nsimple way to quantify whether a transient is point-like,\nas expected.\n3. DEMONSTRATION\n\nTo use the bispectrum for transient detection, we assume that the real part of the mean of all bispectra is\nrelated to the brightness of a single source in the field\nof view. To use the bispectrum to detect and localize\npulses, we propose the following algorithm:\n\u2022 Subtract the mean visibility in time: Differencing visibilities removes all constant emission\nover some time scale, \u03c4 .\n\u2022 Dedisperse visibilities:\nThe frequencydependent arrival time must be removed to\nmaximize SNR per baseline before creating the\nbispectra.\n\u2022 Calculate mean and standard deviation of\nbispectra: The mean of bispectra gives a single\nvalue related to the significance of the transient,\nwhile the standard deviation is related to its spatial structure. Both the mean and standard deviation have dimensions of DM and time, so they can\nbe used to set thresholds just as for a single-dish\ntransients search.\n\u2022 Calibrate and image candidate pulses: Bispectra can be used to make an image, but calibrated visibilities are needed for an accurate localization (Schwab & Cotton 1983). Visibilities need\nto be buffered long enough to capture the dispersive\ndelay across the band. The pulse is then imaged in\na separate process.\nFigure 3 shows how the bispectrum and coherent\nbeamforming techniques detect pulses in PoCo data toward B0329+54. For both techniques, the plot shows the\n2 While this estimate uses the full field of view, the VLBA\nhas a much smaller effective field of view due to the delay beam\n(Deller et al. 2011).\n\nFig. 3.- Top: Time series of the apparent SNR measured by\nthe bispectrum (blue) and with coherent beamforming (red) in 5antenna PoCo data of pulsar B0329+54. The PoCo data have a\ntime resolution of 1.2 ms and have been dedispersed assuming the\nknown DM of B0329+54. This panel shows calibrated data with\nB0329+54 at the phase center. Middle: The same plot but with\nthe pulsar off the phase center. Bottom: The same plot but with\nno phase calibration.\n\napparent pulse SNR when the pulsar is at the phase center, away from the phase center, and at the phase center\nbut uncalibrated. The beamforming technique only detects the pulse when it is at the phase center and data are\ncalibrated. The bispectrum detects the pulse regardless\nof its location or the phase calibration.\nThe apparent SNR of the bispectrum and coherent\nbeamforming techniques for data including several pulses\nare shown in Figure 4. The top panel in Figure 4 shows\nthat the PoCo pulse SNR distribution measured with\nbeamforming and the bispectrum follow the relation of\nRogers et al. (1995) well. Since there are only nine baselines and five triples in this analysis, the pulses shown\nhere have relatively high s. The brightest pulse in this\ndata has s \u223c 3, corresponding to a brightness of about\n50 Jy. A similar search with a larger array would have a\nmuch slower rise in SNRbisp relative to SNRbfc .\nFigure 5 shows how the bispectrum can distinguish between a celestial point transient and terrestrial interference. The top panel shows a typical dynamic spectrum\nfor a VLA observation of the Crab pulsar with 12 millisecond integrations. As is well known from single-dish\nobserving, interference is bright enough to be detected\neven after dedispersion. The bottom panel shows the\nmean bispectrum and standard deviation over bispectra\nfor the same pulse and interference. The interference has\na large standard deviation of bispectra, while the true\nCrab pulse follows the expected theoretical relation for\ns \u226b 1.\n4. DATA AND OPERATIONS RATES\n\nAnother strength of the bispectrum technique is its\ncomputationally efficiency. Table 2 shows how the computational demand scales for three coherent fast transient detection techniques at the VLA. These computational demand values are scaled to operations per second (flops) by multiplying by the integration rate in Hz.\nFor the bispectrum and imaging techniques, the visibilities are dedispersed for each baseline and DM trial,\n\n\f5\n\nFig. 4.- Top: Apparent SNR of the bispectrum versus that\nof coherently beamforming of PoCo data toward B0329+54. The\nSNR is shown for each integration, regardless of significance. The\ndashed line shows the expected cubic dependence in the apparent\nSNR, as described in \u00a72 and shown in Rogers et al. (1995). Bottom:\nA time series of the same two statistics for the same data. The\nrotation period of B0329+54 is about 600 integrations and four of\nthe five pulses in this window are detected. For all detected pulses,\nthe apparent bispectrum SNR is higher than that of beamforming,\nas expected for a small array as PoCo was used at the ATA.\n\nwhile coherent beamforming is traditionally done before dedispersion. The imaging FFT requires Nbl Nch +\n2\n5 Npix\nlog2 N2pix operations per image (Briggs et al. 1999).\nFor the VLA D configuration, images require roughly 128\npixels per side, so Npix = 128.\nThe bispectrum technique is the most computationally\nefficient technique for coherent pulse detection. Running\nthis algorithm on 10 ms integrations at the VLA would\nrequire roughly 34 Gflops. Imaging is at least two times\nmore demanding (this estimate excludes image cleaning).\nThe coherent beamforming is driven by the number of\nbeams needed to fill the field of view. Even in the compact D configuration, roughly 7000 beams are needed.\nThe VLA A configuration would require about 900 times\nmore synthesized beams and 3 Pflops to calculate. The\nlarge computational demand of coherent beamforming\nexplains why it is typically only done with a few beams\n(Stappers et al. 2011).\nOur pulse detection algorithm consists of many independent processes (across frequency, DM trial, and time),\nso the problem is readily parallelized. Moreover, as-\n\nFig. 5.- Top: VLA dynamic spectrum toward the Crab pulsar\nat 1.4 GHz with 12 ms integrations and 128 MHz bandwidth. The\ndynamic spectrum is formed from the sum of all cross correlations,\neffectively forming a synthesized beam at the location of the Crab\npulsar with a brightness in units of Janskys. At the left is a pulse\nfrom the Crab pulsar, which appears as a red vertical line with\na slight kink due to dispersion. Two channels show interference\nof similar strength toward the right. Bottom: The apparent bispectrum SNR versus standard deviation of all bispectra for each\ndedispersed integration. The blue dashed line shows the theoretical expectation for a point source with s \u226b 1. The one point near\nthat line corresponds to the Crab pulse with s \u2248 4.\n\npects of the algorithm, such as the large number of multiplications and dedispersion, are well suited to GPUs\n(Magro et al. 2011; Clark et al. 2011). Table 2 suggests\nthat the bispectrum computational demand can be met\nwith a single GPU-accelerated server. However, the data\nrate associated with millisecond integrations from a large\narray can limit its application for some correlator designs, so careful attention must be paid to data rate bottlenecks. For example, at the VLA, the visibility integration time must be greater than roughly 10 ms, since\nnodes of the WIDAR compute cluster have 1 GbE input\nports (Perley et al. 2011). A correlator that can produce\nvisibilities at high (\u2265 10 Gb s\u22121 ) data rates is more likely\nto be limited by computational resources, driven largely\nby the need to dedisperse visibilities from each baseline.\nIn this case, it will be easier to run this algorithm in real\ntime on arrays with a small number of elements.\nThis description has focused on how the bispectrum\ncan detect an astrophysical transient, but it can't be used\n\n\f6\nto localize it. While the bispectrum can be used to make\nimages of the sky (Schwab & Cotton 1983), precise localization requires external phase calibration. Thus, the\nfinal step in this algorithm is to save candidate transient\ndata for calibration and imaging using traditional techniques (Briggs et al. 1999). This kind of post-processing\nis computationally more intensive than the bispectrum\nand is not feasible in real time on every integration. However, since we only need to calibrate and image the occasional candidate event, the total computational demand\nwill still be dominated by the steps before the event detection.\n5. CONCLUSION\n\nWe demonstrate how to use the bispectrum to detect\nand localize transients with radio interferometers. The\ntechnique produces a single statistic proportional to the\nbrightness of celestial transients, thus reducing the problem of interferometric pulse detection to that of singledish pulse detection. For a small cost in sensitivity, this\ntechnique makes an interferometer into a massive multibeam receiver with a proportionately large survey speed.\nUsing coherent beamforming to survey a similar area\nwith next-generation radio interferometers would require\n102 to 105 times more computational power.\nThe bispectrum technique is efficient enough to build\ninto a correlator for real-time, millisecond transient detection. This system could save visibility data associated with a candidate and apply standard calibration\nand imaging techniques to localize it to arcsecond precision. The growing capacity of correlators for interferometers will make it possible to run such a system in real\ntime to commensally search all data for transients. The\ntechnique can also be used to find transients offline and\non longer time scales. In that case, the bispectrum is\nuseful because it is computationally simple, resistant to\ninterference, and requires no calibration.\nA real-time, commensal system would probe an unprecedented volume of data, giving it sensitivity to rare\ntransients. Each pulse could be localized in real time\n\nto arcsecond precision, opening a range of new science.\nPulses from rotating radio transients (McLaughlin et al.\n2006) could be associated with X-ray counterparts to\nhelp address their relation to the normal pulsar population.\nThe dispersion of extragalactic transients\nwould measure the electron density of the intergalactic\nmedium for the first time (McLaughlin & Cordes 2003;\nLorimer et al. 2007); localization will help find optical\ncounterparts and redshifts to host galaxies for each pulse.\nA fast transients survey of the Galactic center could detect individual pulses from pulsars that would probe the\ndispersion toward the region and potentially find a pulsar\nin orbit around a supermassive black hole (Pfahl & Loeb\n2004; Macquart et al. 2010; Wharton et al. 2011). Magnetospheres of exoplanets and active stars can emit\nbright, complex bursts that could uniquely identify them\n(Lazio et al. 2004; Hallinan et al. 2006).\nThe strength of the bispectrum technique is its realtime ability to find transients throughout the field of\nview and reduce the flow of data to select times. This\nshows how algorithms will be key to efficiently extracting the best science in the era of big data. The ability\nto find pulses with interferometers may have application\nto communications problems, such as developing smart\nantennas for the efficient use of spectrum. If so, this\ntechnique would follow in the footsteps of previous transients searches that contributed to the development of\nWi-Fi (Osullivan et al. 1978).\n\nWe thank Michael Rupen, Rick Perley, and Bryan Butler for providing VLA fast dump data, Peter Williams\nfor developing Miriad-Python, and Gregg Hallinan, Scott\nVander Wiel, and Olaf Wucknitz for useful discussion.\nWe are grateful to National Science Foundation grant\nAST-0807151 for support of this research.
