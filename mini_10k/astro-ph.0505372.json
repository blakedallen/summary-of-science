Introduction\nThe gravitational lens system QSO 2237+0305 consists of a\ndistant quasar, at zQ = 1.695, quadruply imaged by a nearby\nspiral galaxy, at zG = 0.039 (Huchra et al. 1985). Soon after its discovery, photometric monitoring of the individual images revealed that they possessed uncorrelated variability; this\nwas interpreted as being due to gravitational microlensing by\ncompact objects in the lensing galaxy (Irwin et al. 1989). This\nconclusion was confirmed with further monitoring of this system, revealing complex variability consistent with the quasar\nbeing swept with the high magnifications associated with caustics (Corrigan et al. 1991, \u00d8stensen et al. 1996, Vakulkik et\nal. 1997, Wo\u017aniak et al. 2000, Alcalde et al. 2002, Schmidt et\nal. 2002). Two recent campaigns have provided exquisite light\ncurves for the four images in this system; OGLE (Wo\u017aniak et\nal. 2000) consists of low temporal sampling over a long time\nframe, while GLITP (Alcalde et al. 2002) was a short, targeted\ncampaign, undertake at high temporal sampling.\nThe datasets from OGLE and GLITP have been used extensively to probe the physical properties of both the quasar emission region and the distribution of microlensing masses in the\nforeground galaxy. Wyithe et al. (2000a) used the OGLE (and\nother extant datasets) to place a limit on the size of the quasar\nemission region, finding it to be smaller than 0.025 \u03b70 (99%\nconfidence level). Here, \u03b70 is the Einstein radius in the source\nplane, the natural scale length for microlensing (e.g., Schneider\net al. 1992); this depends upon the square root of the microlensing masses, and for a Solar mass star in QSO 2237+0305 this\ncorresponds to 1.9 \u00d7 1017cm. For a sub-Jupiter mass microlensSend offprint requests to: R. Gil-Merino\n\ning (10\u22124 M\u2299 ) acting as a microlenses, this implies a source\nemission radius of \u223c 5 \u00d7 1013 cm. In a subsequent paper, these\nauthors ruled out explicitly and unambiguously a significant\ncontribution of such (sub-)Jupiter-mass microlenses (Wyithe\net al 2000b), while Wyithe et al. (2000c) also put limited the\ntransverse velocity of the lensing galaxy with an upper limit\nvt < 600 km/s in the lens plane (which corresponds approximately to vt < 6000 km/s in the source plane), analyzing statistically the properties of the derivatives of the amplitude variations in the light curves of the system. Furthermore, Shalyapin\net al. (2002) and Goicoechea et al. (2003) analyzed the light\ncurves obtained during the GLITP observational campaign, utilizing both V and R bands to obtained a physical source size of\n3.7 \u00d7 1016 cm (0.012 pc) at 2\u03c3 confidence level. Moreover,\nthey fitted a standard Newtonian accretion disk for the source\n(Shakura & Sunyaev 1973), amongst others, to obtain a mass\nfor the central massive black hole of 108 M\u2299 .\nIn a recent contribution, Lee et al. (2005) also used the results of the OGLE and GLITP monitoring campaigns to determine the physical properties in QSO 2237+0305. Their study\npresents a new method for fitting the variability observed in a\nmicrolensing light curve, exactly determining the locations of\nthe microlensing masses and the emission profile of the source,\nfinding that only a source model with a black hole can reproduce the features seen in one of the components (namely\nA, see Fig. 1). In addition, they found that the masses of\nthe microlenses in the lensing galaxy must be of the order of\n10\u22124 M\u2299 , and the continuum source size of the quasar should\nbe \u2248 4 \u00d7 1015 cm.\nClearly, the physical quantities obtained by Lee et al.\n(2005) are in evident disagreement with these previous stud-\n\n\f2\n\nGil-Merino & Lewis: Microlensing in QSO 2237+0305: Stars or planets?\ngalaxy bar\n\nB\nC\n\ngalaxy center\nD\nA\ngalaxy bar\n\nN\nE\n\n1 arcsec\n\nFig. 1.

In this contribution,\nthe approach adopted by Lee et al. (2005) is critically examined and it is shown that the modeling technique is based upon\nflawed assumptions and hence their conclusions cannot be accepted.\n\n2. Discussion\nMicrolensing at low optical depths, where lensing objects are\nwell separated (except for cases of binary stars, etc.) can be\nsimply analyzed; an example of this is microlensing within\nthe Galactic halo where detailed parameters for lensing masses\nand separations, as well as source profiles, can be determined\nfrom well sampled light curves (Paczynski 1986a). Once the\ndensity of stars, and hence the microlensing optical depth, increases, such a simple approach is not possible as the combination of the gravitational lensing by many bodies results in complex magnification patterns and clustered caustics (Paczynski\n1986b). A semi-analytical formulation is still possible for point\nsources (Lewis et al. 1993; Witt 1993), but in the case of\nextended sources, such a situation rapidly becomes analytically intractable and numerical approaches are required. The\nworkhorse for studying gravitational lensing in the high optical depth regime has been the inverse ray-tracing method\n(Kayser et al. 1986, Wambsganss et al. 1990). The synthetic\nlight curves derived from these simulations depend upon several parameters: the mass of the microlenses, the distribution\nof matter in the lens plane (this is modeled by a surface mass\ndensity and the shear obtained fitting the observable parameters of the system to a lens model), the adopted emission profile for the source and the resulting effective transverse velocity due to the joint motion of source, lens, microlenses and\nobserver. Even when representing a combination of these parameters, an extraordinary range of potential light curves are\npossible due to the different random configurations of the microlensing masses. A dominant factor, however, is the relative\nsize of the source emission region compared to the Einstein radius of a typical microlensing mass; as the size of the source\nregion is increased, the more the microlensing magnification\nmap is smoothed out, reducing the degree of variability in a\nmicrolensing light curve. An implication of this relation is that\n\na small source with small microlensing masses can induce the\nsame degree of flux variability as a large source with correspondingly large masses.\nThe caustic network produced at high optical depth is very\ncomplex, displaying regions of tight, clustered caustics, interspaced with regions of gently undulating magnification (see fig.\n2). Importantly, it has been shown (e.g. Paczynski 1986b) that\nat such high optical depth individual microlenses cannot accurately reproduce the complicated net of caustics seen in magnification maps. Since the generation of caustics in a magnification map is a highly non-linear process, the addition or elimination of a single microlens can significantly distort significant\nregions of the magnification pattern, typically on scales larger\nthan the caustic influence of an isolated mass (Wambsganss\n1992). This was revealed during the first analysis of the microlensing light curve of QSO 2237+0305: Irwin et al. (1989)\ntried to directly estimate the mass of the microlens responsible for a particular event observed in one of the images in\nthis system, using the time scale of the variability and relating to the Einstein radius of an isolated microlensing mass. In\na further analysis of this microlensing light curve, the same\ngroup (Webster et al. 1991) suggested that this procedure was\nnot the correct approach, due to the non-linear way in which\nmicrolenses masses combine to produce the caustic structure,\na situation confirmed in the theoretical work of Wambsganss\n(1992).\nIt is important to remember this lesson when examining\nthe recent study of microlensing in QSO 2237+0305 by Lee et\nal. (2005). Their approach attempts to directly and exactly reconstruct the observed variability in the light curves, by firstly\nadopting the shear for the two images they analyzed (A and C)\nfrom the macromodel of Witt et al. (1995). They then proceed\nto construct the caustic network by individually adding microlenses; the first mass produces the simple caustic structure\nof an isolated Chang-Refsdal lens (Chang & Refsdal 1979), but\nsubsequent individual masses distort this caustic structure into\na more complex form. Then, convolving this caustic map with a\nsource surface brightness distribution, the synthetic light curve\ncan be directly compared with the observed variability and the\nlocation of the microlensing masses and the source profile can\nbe adjusted via a standard minimization to account for the observed variability. From the density of microlensing masses\nused to finally reconstruct the microlensing light curve, these\nauthors then \"deduce\" the microlensing optical depth responsible.\nIn critically examining the approach by Lee et al. (2005),\nnamed LOHCAM (Local High Amplification Event Caustic\nModel), a number of shortcomings are directly evident. The\nconstruction approach assumes that the microlensing masses\nare somehow isolated, resulting in an isolated caustic network\nwhose precise properties can be determined. While isolated\ngroups of caustics do occur at high optical depths, such groups\nare not formed by isolated groups of stars, rather they occur\ndue to the non-linear combination of distributed microlensing\nmasses embedded in a population as a whole. This effectively\ninvalidates one of the primary assumptions of the approach by\nLee et al. (2005). This is further exacerbated by their treatment\nof the shear. Firstly, Lee et al. (2005) chose the model of Witt\n\n\fGil-Merino & Lewis: Microlensing in QSO 2237+0305: Stars or planets?\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n\u221210\n\u221220\n\u221230\n\u221240\n\u221250\n\u221250\n\n\u221240\n\n\u221230\n\n\u221220\n\n\u221210\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\nmagnification\n\net al. (1995), arguing that the accurate model of Schmidt et\nal. (1998) does not take account of the dark halo of the lensing galaxy. However, the analysis of Witt et al. (1995) found\nthe shear at a particular image is strongly dependent upon the\nadopted parameterization of their mass models and hence the\nselection of a particular value may not reflect the true shear.\nThe second problem with their approach comes in the application of this shear; again, the authors consider the cluster of\nstars responsible for the microlensing in QSO 2237+0305 to be\nsomehow isolated, subject only to the global shear for the region. In reality, however, the shear at any point in a high optical\ndepth microlensing star field will differ significantly from the\nglobal shear due to coherent shearing effects of other masses\nin the population. The only way to counter this is to assume\nthat the microlensing situation under consideration is actually\nat low optical depth [effectively the conclusion reached by Lee\net al. (2005)], or that the cluster is somehow truly isolated from\nthe overall microlensing population. The first option contradicts all modeling of the gravitational lensing in this system,\nwhereas the second is extremely contrived.\nThe result of this procedure, therefore, will be a macro\nmodel for the images in QSO 2237+0305 which bares no resemblance to reality. Rather, like a typically underconstrained\nmodel, with enough parameters a fit to the data can be made,\nbut this fit will have no physical meaning. This can clearly be\nseen if we extend the analysis of Lee et al (2005) to images B\nand D in QSO 2237+0305. Unlike images A and C, these two\nimages have remained relatively quiescent since the discovery\nof this lensing system (see Fig. 1 again for the configuration\nof the four images of the system). The approach of Lee et al.\n(2005) would conclude that the optical depth to microlensing\nin these images is essentially zero, with no caustic features required to explain the lack of variability. Clearly this conflicts\nwith the established models of these images which show the\noptical depth to be substantial and where quiescent periods naturally arise in the clustered caustic maps that result at such optical depths (see fig. 2). It should be noted that such quiescent\nperiods are not due to gaps in the stellar distribution, but are\nthe result of the complex combination of magnfications due to\nmany stars in the lensing galaxy.\nHence, the approach adopted by Lee et al. (2005) results\nin an unphysical model, but could it be employed to understand the details of microlensing at high optical depth? Such\nan approach would require no a priori selection of parameters,\nsuch as global shear, but would have to have to search parameter space for particular combinations of convergence and shear.\nSuch an approach, however, is extremely computationally expensive, especially given the almost infinite random locations\nof microlensing masses, as well as the more vexing question\nof just how many masses are required to properly describe the\nmicrolensing as a whole. In summary, the search for a unique\nanswer will be underconstrained and plagued by degeneracies.\nTherefore, any realistic analysis of the microlensing mass distribution in QSO 2237+0305 can only be undertaken via statistical techniques.\nLee et al. (2005) seem to be aware of the necessity of a\nstatistical approach, although it is not employed in their current contribution, and note that it is necessary to determine the\n\n3\n\n0\n\n\u22120.5\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22121.5\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\npixel units\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nFig. 2. The upper panel presents a subregion of the random star\nfield for image D of Q2237 using the model parameters given\nby Schmidt el al. (1998), while the central panel presents the\ncorresponding caustics pattern is 10 Einstein radii on a side,\ncovered by 1024 pixels. This shows regions of very low magnification (dark areas) and also complicated caustic clustering\n(lighter areas). Synthetic light curves drawn from such magnification patterns reveal both quiescent periods and episodes\nof higher variability. Note that for a typical transverse velocity,\nthe time scale for the light curve in this figure (lower panel) is\n\u223c 50 years, simply accounting for the flat nature of the light\ncurve of image D.\n\ntransverse velocity of the lensing galaxy in QSO 2237+0305.\nSeveral statistical approaches have already been conducted to\ndetermine this velocity (see Wyithe et al 2000c; Kochanek\n2004; Tuntsov et al. 2004). Gil-Merino et al. (2005) studied\n1.5\u00d7107 synthetic light curves drawn from magnification maps\nfor images B and D, examining the distribution of quiescent periods, although all four images were utilized in the overall analysis. Hence, this analysis is compatible with both periods of\nquietness for these two components and periods of variability\nin the A and C components. Using a range of physical source\nsizes from 1014 cm to 1016 cm, they obtained an upper limit for\nthe effective transverse velocity vt < 630 km/s in the lens plane\nfor M\u03bclenses = 0.1 M\u2299 (a factor of 10 larger in the source plane\nand a factor of 3.5 for M\u03bclenses = 1 M\u2299 ). The result in the\n\n\f4\n\nGil-Merino & Lewis: Microlensing in QSO 2237+0305: Stars or planets?\n\neffective transverse velocity was not dependent on the source\nsize in the explored range. Hence, the source size adopted by\nLee et al. (2005) was indirectly tested in this previous work,\nwhich adds another argument against the Lee et al. (2005) results; if the conclusions of Lee et al. (2005) are correct, and a\npopulation of sub-Jupiter mass objects are responsible for the\nmicrolensing in QSO 2237+0305, then the transverse velocity\nof the lensing galaxy must be reduced by a factor of 10-100 to\nbe able to produce the quiescent periods observed in light curve\nof image D. Such a situation is physically implausible as even\nif the bulk velocity of the galaxy is assumed to be small, the\npeculiar motions of the stars will be much higher (215 km/s,\nFoltz et al. 1992) and will be the dominant effect (Kundic &\nWambsganss 1993).\n\n3. Conclusions\nLee et al. (2005) have presented a new analysis of\nthe light curves of the gravitationally microlensed quasar\nQSO 2237+0305. The conclusions of this result differ significantly from other analyses of the same data set, finding an exact\nfit to the light curves with only a small number of microlensing stars. This letter has outlined several significant flaws in\nthe approach adopted by Lee et al. (2005), finding their initial assumptions, and hence their conclusions, to be incorrect.\nFurthermore, given the almost infinite potential range of configurations of microlensing masses, any exact fit to the data will\nbe subject to a huge range of degeneracies and no uniqueness\nfor a particular configuration can be reliably claimed. Hence,\nsuch microlensing analysis cannot be represented by a model\nminimization approach. In summary, this letter suggests that\nthe Lee et al. (2005) claim that their approach will play a key\nrole in the future of the study of high magnification microlensing events is incorrect.\nReferences\nAlcalde D., Mediavilla E., Moreau O. et al. 2002, ApJ, 572, 729\nChang K., Refsdal S., 1979, Nature, 282, 561\nCorrigan R.T., Irwin M.J., Arnaud J. et al. 1991, AJ, 102, 34\nFoltz C.B., Hewett P.C., Webster R.L., Lewis G.F., 1992, ApJ, 386, 43\nGil-Merino R., 2003, PhD Thesis, Potsdam Univ., Germany\nGil-Merino R., Wambsganss J., Goicoechea L.J., Lewis G.F., 2005,\nA&A, 432, 83\nGoicoechea L.J., Alcalde D., Mediavilla E., Mu\u00f1oz J.A., A&A, 397,\n517\nHaugan S.V.H., IAU, 173, 255\nIrwin M.J., Webster R.L., Hewett P.C. et al. 1989, AJ, 98, 1989\nKayser R., Refsdal S., Stabell R., 1986, A&A, 166, 36\nKochanek C.S., 2004, ApJ, 605, 58\nKundic T., Wambsganss J., 1993, ApJ, 404, 455\nLee D.-W., Surdej J., Moreau O. et al. 2005, A&A, submitted,\nastro-ph/0503018\nLewis G.F., Miralda-Escud\u00e9 J., Richardson D.C., Wambsganss J.,\n1993, MNRAS, 261, 647\n\u00d8stensen R., Refsdal S., Stabell R. et al. 1996, A&A, 309, 59\nPaczynski B., 1986, ApJ, 304, 1\nPaczynski B., 1986, ApJ, 301, 503\nShakura N.I., Sunyaev R.A., 1973, A&A, 24, 337\nSchmidt R., Kundi\u0107 T., Pen U.-L. et al. 2002, A&A, 392, 773\n\nSchmidt R.W., Webster R.L., Lewis G.F, 1998, MNRAS, 295, 488\nShalyapin V.N., Goicoechea L.J., Alcalde D. et al., 2002, ApJ, 579,\n127\nSchneider P., Ehlers J., Falco E.E., 1992, \"Gravitational Lenses\"\n(Berlin, Springer Verlag)\nTuntsov A.V., Walker M.A., Lewis G.F., 2004, MNRAS, 352, 125\nVakulik V.G., Dudinov V.N., Zheleznyak A.P. et al. 1997, Astron.\nNachr., 318, no.2, 73\nWambsganss J., 1992, ApJ, 392, 424\nWambsganss J., Paczynski B., Katz N., 1990, ApJ, 352, 407\nWebster R.L., Ferguson A.M.N., Corrigan R.T.
