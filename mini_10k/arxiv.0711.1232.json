Using the photometric and spectroscopic database of these 504 GCs,\nwe have investigated the kinematics of the M31 GC system. We find that the all\nGC system shows strong rotation, with rotation amplitude of vrot \u223c 190 km s\u22121 ,\nand that a weak rotation persists even for the outermost samples at |Y | \u2265 5 kpc\nwhere Y represents the projected distance from the major axis. The rotationcorrected velocity dispersion for the GC system is estimated to be \u03c3p,r \u223c 130 km\ns\u22121 , and it increases from \u03c3p,r \u223c 120 km s\u22121 at |Y | < 1 kpc to \u03c3p,r \u223c 150 km\ns\u22121 at |Y | \u2265 5 kpc.

They are much brighter than stars and the\nspatial distribution of the GCs is much more extended than that of the halo stars in galaxies.\nTherefore they are an excellent tool to investigate the kinematics of the main components\n(stellar and dark matter halo, bulge, and disk) of galaxies and to estimate the mass of their\nhost galaxies.\n\nM31 is a unique object as the nearest spiral galaxy in the Local Group, providing an\nexcellent place to study GCs. It has the largest GC system of any galaxy within several Mpc.\nTherefore, there are numerous studies of GCs in M31 since the first study by Hubble (1932)\n(e.g., (van den Bergh 1969; Sargent et al. 1977; Battistini et al. 1987; Huchra et al. 1991;\nBarmby et al. 2000; Perrett et al. 2002; Morrison et al. 2004; Burstein et al. 2004; Huxor et al.\n2005; Beasley et al. 2005; Puzia et al. 2005; Galleti et al. 2006; Kim et al. 2007) and see\nextensive lists of earlier references in Hodge (1992); van den Bergh (2000)). In addition,\nthere were several surveys and studies of the M31 GCs with X-ray detection, finding that the\nX-ray emitting GCs are commonly associated with low-mass X-ray binaries (Supper et al.\n2001; Kong et al. 2002; Di Stefano et al. 2002; Kaaret 2002; Williams et al. 2004; Trudolyubov & Priedh\n2004; Pietsch et al. 2005; Fan et al. 2005; Trudolyubov et al. 2005, 2006).\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nKinematics is one of the notable features for the M31 GCs, and has long been a focus\nof study. It is known that the kinematics of the M31 GCs is much different from that of the\nGalactic GCs in the sense that the former is dominated by rotation, while the latter shows\nweak rotation (Perrett et al. 2002)\nThe first detailed kinematic analysis of the M31 GC system was given by Hartwick & Sargent\n(1974) using radial velocities for 44 GCs in van den Bergh (1969). They estimated the total mass of M31, Mtot = 3.4 \u00b1 1.4 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 , and found that the metal-poor GCs have a\nlarger velocity dispersion than the metal-rich GCs. Huchra et al. (1982) obtained digital,\nlow-dispersion spectra of 61 GCs, and found that the GC system rotates with an amplitude\nof 160 \u00b1 40 km s\u22121 . They also found a measurable but small metallicity gradient and no\nsignificant spectroscopic difference between the GCs with X-ray detection and those without\nX-ray detection. Federici et al. (1990) using the velocity data of 81 GCs obtained a total\nmass of 3.2 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 for a radius of 16 kpc using a projected mass estimator. A comparison\nof the data with the model of Richstone & Tremaine (1984) showed that the GCs have circular or isotropic orbits, and lead to a total mass of \u223c 7 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 based on circular orbits.\nLater, Federici et al. (1993) updated the total mass of M31 to be 5 \u2212 8 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 for a\nradius of 30 kpc using velocity data for 176 GCs.\nIn the 1990's, metallicity information for a large sample of GCs (N > 100) became\navailable, and it was possible to investigate the kinematics of GC subsamples based on the\nmetallicity. Huchra et al. (1991) estimated the radial velocities and metallicities for 150\nGCs, and presented the detailed kinematics of the GC system using expanded subsamples\nof GCs based on metallicity. They identified a weak metallicity gradient as a function of\nprojected radius. They found that, in the inner region (< 2 kpc), the metal-rich ([Fe/H]\u2265\n\u22120.8) GCs exhibit a rapid rotation of 100 \u2212 200 km s\u22121 , while the metal-poor GCs show\nno significant rotation. However, the rotation of the two subsamples could not be easily\nmeasured at larger radii. Later, Perrett et al. (2002) showed, using higher precision data\nof over 200 GCs ( typical velocity measurement error of 12 km s\u22121 ), that the entire M31\nGC system is highly rotation-supported. This is in strong contrast to the case of the Milky\nWay where the GC system composed mostly of halo GCs is pressure-supported, although\na minor system of the bulge GCs shows some rotation. They also found that the centrally\nconcentrated metal-rich GCs appear not to be flattened, but are analogous to the bulge\npopulation with a strong rotation, and that the less concentrated metal-poor GCs also show\na rapid rotation. Galleti et al. (2006) obtained velocity data for 42 genuine GCs, and\nproduced a large data set of 349 M31 GCs with up-to-date velocities by combining all\ninformation in the literature.\nRecently, large datasets of velocities for M31 GCs and several deep photometric studies\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nof the halo fields in M31 have provided important clues for understanding the evolution of\nM31. Brown et al. (2003) presented very deep photometry of stars in a halo field along\nthe minor axis of M31 at a projected distance of 11 kpc (corresponding to a deprojected\ndistance of 53 kpc) and found that the M31 halo includes a major intermediate-age metalrich population and a significant old metal-poor population. They suggested from this result\nthat M31 may have undergone a major merger 6 \u2212 8 Gyr ago. Later Brown et al. (2007)\nsuggested, from photometry of another minor-axis halo field at a projected distance of 21\nkpc, that the outer spheroid is dominated by the debris of earlier merging events that might\nhave occurred more than 8 Gyr ago.\nMorrison et al. (2004) suggested the existence of an old thin disk composed of GCs in\nM31, using the data for 321 GCs presented in Perrett et al. (2002). Since the GCs in the\nthin disk have a metallicity distribution from [Fe/H] \u223c \u22122.2 to above solar, and the metalpoor GCs are regarded as being as old as their Galactic counterparts, they concluded that\nthe thin disk has remained undisturbed for \u223c 10 Gyr or more. This is contradictory with the\nscenario of Brown et al. (2003) that M31 may have undergone a major merger 6\u22128 Gyr ago.\nLater Beasley et al. (2004, 2005) suggested that the majority of M31 thin disk GCs may\nbe significantly younger than 10 Gyr, up to \u223c 1 Gyr and metal-rich (\u22120.20 \u2264[Fe/H]\u2264 0.35).\nThe existence of young and metal-rich GCs in the disk is also confirmed in other studies as\nwell (Burstein et al. 2004; Puzia et al. 2005).\nOn the other hand Ashman & Bird (1993) first tried to identify subgroups in the M31\nGC system using the positional and velocity information for 144 GCs in Huchra et al.\n(1991). They suggested that the clustering of GCs in position and velocity space may be\na surviving signature of gaseous clumps from which the galaxy halo of M31 formed. Later,\nPerrett et al. (2003), using 301 GCs with measured velocity and metallicity in Perrett et al.\n(2002), searched for the subclustering of M31 GCs in the parameter space of projected radius,\nradial velocity, and metallicity. Interestingly Morrison et al. (2003) found a possible tidally\ndistorted satellite of M31, Andromeda VIII, from the identification of a group of 5 \u2212 12\nplanetary nebulae (PNe), 1 \u2212 3 GCs, and two HI clouds. Recent kinematic studies of M31\nstreams (Ibata et al. 2001; McConnachie et al. 2004) started examining the GC groups\nincluding Andromeda VIII as a possible progenitor of the stream (e.g., Font et al. 2006a;\nFardal et al. 2006a).\nAlthough there were numerous studies to obtain the radial velocities and the metallicities\nfor M31 GCs, there are still many GC candidates for which spectroscopic information is\nneeded. For example, there are 569 GC candidates for which radial velocities are not available\nin a combined sample of M31 GCs in Galleti et al. (2006). Recently we have performed\na homogeneous photometric and spectroscopic, wide-field survey of GCs in M31 covering a\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nfield of \u223c 3\u25e6 \u00d7 3\u25e6 centered on M31. We presented the first result of our survey: a catalog of\nnew GCs in M31 (Kim et al. 2007, Paper I). This is the second in the series of papers on\nthis survey.\nIn this paper, we present the results of a kinematic study of the GC system in M31\nusing the velocity data of 150 GCs newly obtained in our survey and 354 GCs previously\nknown in the literature. Section 2 gives a brief description of the data used in this analysis,\nand section 3 investigates the kinematic properties for various subsamples of M31 GCs. We\ndiscuss primary results in \u00a74. A summary is given in the final section.\nWe adopted a distance to M31 of 780 kpc derived by McConnachie et al. (2005) based\non the method of the tip of the red giant branch, which is similar to the value given by\nFreedman & Madore (1990), 770 kpc. At this distance one arcmin in the sky corresponds\nto 0.227 kpc. We adopted the center position of M31 as \u03b10 = 00h 42m 44.s 3, \u03b40 = +41\u25e6 16\u2032 09\u2032\u2032\n(J2000; Crane et al. 1992). Following the geometric transformation of Huchra et al. (1991),\nwe define the X and Y coordinates, which are the projected distances along the major\nand minor axis, respectively. X and Y increase towards the northeast and the northwest,\nrespectively, and are given by,\nx\u2032 = sin (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b10 ) cos \u03b4,\n\n(1)\n\ny = sin \u03b4 cos \u03b40 \u2212 cos (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b10 ) cos \u03b4 sin \u03b40 ,\n\n(2)\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nX = x sin (PA) + y cos (PA),\n\n(3)\n\nY = \u2212x\u2032 cos (PA) + y \u2032 sin (PA),\n\n(4)\n\nwhere x\u2032 and y \u2032 are Cartesian coordinates for \u03b1 and \u03b4 with a center at (\u03b10 , \u03b40 ), and PA= 37.7\u25e6\nis the position angle for the major axis (de Vaucouleurs 1958).\n\n2.\n2.1.\n\nData\n\nMaster catalog of M31 GCs\n\nFirst we used the data of GCs in M31 given in Paper I, which describes the details of\nour survey's photometric and spectroscopic observations, data reduction, and the data set.\nHere we only give a brief summary of the data set of M31 GCs.\nWe selected GC candidates in Washington CMT1 CCD images covering a \u223c 3\u25e6 \u00d7 3\u25e6\nfield centered on M31, obtained at the KPNO 0.9 m telescope. Spectroscopic observations\nwere made using the Hydra multifiber bench spectrograph at the WIYN 3.5 m telescope\nin September 2000 and November 2001 for 748 GC candidates including 106 previously\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nknown GCs. We determined the radial velocities for GC candidates by cross-correlating\nthe candidate spectrum with those of two bright bonafide GCs in M31. Finally, we have\nindependently found 1164 GCs and GC candidates, of which 559 are previously known GCs or\nGC candidates and 605 are newly found GC candidates. Among the GCs and GC candidates\nin our survey, there are 211 genuine GCs (class 1 in Paper I) with measured velocity. We\nhave derived new velocity data for 150 GCs in our wide-field survey.\nGalleti et al. (2004) compiled all known GCs and GC candidates in M31 in the literature,\nand published the Revised Bologna Catalogue (RBC) with 1035 objects. Later, Galleti et al.\n(2006) published an updated version of the Revised Bologna Catalogue V2.0 (RBC2) with\n1164 objects. In order to produce a master catalog of radial velocities for M31 genuine\nGCs, we have secured, from the RBC2, 349 genuine GCs (class 1 in RBC2) with measured\nvelocities and 5 GC candidates (ID B366, G137, B102, B430, B134 in RBC2) with measured\nvelocities that were classified as genuine GCs in our survey. There are 61 objects in common\nbetween this study and the RBC2, if we use a matching tolerance of 4\u2032\u2032 . We have compared\nour velocity measurements with published velocity measurements (references are in RBC2)\nfor these common objects, as displayed in Figure 1. This shows that our measurements,\nwith a typical error of 35.3 km/s, agree with the published values within the combined\nerrors except for nine objects showing velocity differences of over 110 km s\u22121 . We present\nthe identification in RBC2 for these GCs in Figure 1. We tried to find any cause of the large\ndifference for the nine objects, finding some explanation for five of them (B109, B124, B293,\nB315, and NB 21), but none for the other four(B347, B200, B331, and B387). The reasons\nfor large velocity differences for five of these nine objects are as follows:\n1. B109 There are two velocity measurements for this object: \u2212613 \u00b1 24 km s\u22121 in\nHuchra et al. (1991) and \u2212372\u00b112 km s\u22121 in Perrett et al. (2002). Since the velocity\ndifference between two measurements is large and Perrett et al. (2002) gives higher\nprecision data, RBC2 quoted \u2212372 \u00b1 12 km s\u22121 . However, the measured velocity in\nour study is \u2212568 \u00b1 47 km s\u22121 , which is consistent with the value in Huchra et al.\n(1991).\n2. B124 There are two velocity measurements for this object: \u221275 \u00b1 22 km s\u22121 in\nJablonka et al. (1998) and 70 \u00b1 13 km s\u22121 in Barmby et al. (2000). Since the velocity difference between these two measurements is large and Barmby et al. (2000)\ngives the value with the smaller error, RBC2 quoted 70 \u00b1 13 km s\u22121 . However, the\nmeasured velocity in our study is \u2212138 \u00b1 49 km s\u22121 , which is consistent with the value\nin Jablonka et al. (1998).\n3. B293 There are two velocity measurements for this object: \u2212345 \u00b1 35 km s\u22121 in\nHuchra et al. (1991) and \u2212467 km s\u22121 in Federici et al. (1993). RBC2 presented the\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nvalue of a weighted mean (\u2212424 \u00b1 23 km s\u22121 ), although the velocity difference is about\n130 km s\u22121 . However, the measured velocity in our study is \u2212534 \u00b1 31 km s\u22121 , which\nis closer to the value of Federici et al. (1993).\n4. B315 There are three velocity measurements for this object: \u2212291 \u00b1 108 km s\u22121 in\nHuchra et al. (1991), \u2212434 km s\u22121 in Federici et al. (1993), and \u2212559 \u00b1 12 km s\u22121 in\nPerrett et al. (2002). RBC2 presented the value of a weighted mean (\u2212437 \u00b1 18 km\ns\u22121 ) excluding the measurement in Perrett et al. (2002). However, the measured velocity in our study is \u2212566\u00b146 km s\u22121 , which is consistent with the value of Perrett et al.\n(2002).\n5. NB21 The velocity measurement in our study is \u2212311 \u00b1 35 km s\u22121 , while that in\nJablonka et al. (1998) is \u2212773 \u00b1 40 km s\u22121 . Since the pointing coordinate of our\nspectroscopic observation is different from the photometric center of this object by\nabout 1.72 \u2032\u2032 , and this object is located in Field 25 in Paper I that is close to the M31\ncenter, the observed spectrum in this study might be significantly contaminated by the\nM31 stellar light.\nSince our measurements for B109, B124, B293, and B315 are similar to those of at\nleast one value in the literature, we prefer to keep our measurements for those GCs at this\ntime. We keep our measurement for NB21 for further analysis, since there is no convincing\nevidence to change our measurement at this moment.\nFrom the weighted linear fit discarding these nine objects with large velocity differences,\nwe derive a transformation relation between the two systems,\n\nvThis\n\nstudy\n\n= 1.09(\u00b10.03) vRBC2 + 37.8(\u00b18.8) km s\u22121 , rms = 37.8 km s\u22121 , N = 52.\n\n(5)\n\nThe radial velocities for the GCs in RBC2 were transformed onto our velocity system\nusing equation (5), and the transformed velocities were used for further analysis. We used\nour velocity measurements for the above nine objects. Finally, we produced a master catalog\nof radial velocities for 504 genuine GCs in M31. We derived T1 magnitudes for 483 out of\n504 GCs in the master catalog from the CCD images used for our survey as described in\nKim et al. (2007).\nFigure 2 displays the errors of the measured velocities for the M31 GCs versus T1\nmagnitude (a) and versus R, a galactocentric radial distance corrected for the inclination of\nM31 using the equation R = [X 2 + (Y /cos i)2 ]1/2 where i is the inclination angle, i = 77.7\u25e6\n(b). In Figure 2(a), the errors for 136 metal-poor GCs and 63 metal-rich GCs derived in\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nthis study are plotted with those for 174 metal-poor GCs and 58 metal-rich GCs derived in\nthe previous studies. In Figure 2(b), the errors for 46 bright GCs and 99 faint GCs derived\nin this study are plotted with those for 155 bright GCs and 104 faint GCs derived in the\nprevious studies (Division of the entire sample of M31 GCs into subclasses depending on\nthe metallicity and magnitude will be described in detail in the following section). Mean\nerrors for the measured velocities are 27 \u00b1 18 km s\u22121 for all 504 GCs, 40 \u00b1 16 km s\u22121 for\n211 GCs measured in this study, and 17 \u00b1 12 km s\u22121 for 293 GCs measured in the previous\nstudies. Mean errors for the measured velocities of the bright and faint GCs are 35 \u00b1 12\nkm s\u22121 and 40 \u00b1 17 km s\u22121 for 46 bright GCs and 99 faint GCs, respectively, measured in\nthis study, and 17 \u00b1 13 km s\u22121 and 17 \u00b1 9 km s\u22121 for 155 bright GCs and 104 faint GCs,\nrespectively, measured in the previous studies. In the case of the previous measurements, a\nsignificant fraction of the measurements for faint GCs have typical errors of 12 km s\u22121 given\nby Perrett et al. (2002), much smaller than the values in other studies, which leads to a\nsmaller mean value for faint GCs. Excluding the data by Perrett et al. (2002), the mean\nerrors are 18 \u00b1 15 km s\u22121 and 22 \u00b1 13 km s\u22121 for bright GCs and faint GCs, respectively.\nFigure 2 shows that the mean errors for the measured velocities increase as the GCs get\nfainter, and that they are larger in the inner region where the background level is higher\nthan that in the outer region of M31.\nThe mean values of the radial velocities are derived using the biweight location of\nBeers et al. (1990): vp = \u2212281 \u00b1 13 km s\u22121 for 211 GCs measured in this study, and\nvp = \u2212285 \u00b18 km s\u22121 for all 504 GCs in the master catalog. These values are consistent with\nthose in the previous studies (vp = \u2212284\u00b19 km s\u22121 in Perrett et al. 2002 and vp = \u2212296\u00b112\nkm s\u22121 in Galleti et al. 2006) within the uncertainty, and are also compatible with the M31\nsystemic velocity measured in this study (vp = \u2212290 \u00b1 69 km s\u22121 ) and that in the literature\n(vp = \u2212300 \u00b1 4 km s\u22121 in de Vaucouleurs et al. 1991) within the uncertainty. The larger\nerror in our estimate of the M31 systemic velocity is primarily due to the fact that we used,\nas templates, the spectra of GCs with small velocity dispersion to estimate the velocity of\nthe nucleus of M31 that has much larger velocity dispersion.\nFigure 3 shows the radial velocity histogram for all 504 GCs as well as 211 GCs measured\nin this study. It appears that the majority of all GCs are in the range \u2212750 km s\u22121 \u2264 vp <\n+100 km s\u22121 , and the velocity distribution for all GCs is roughly symmetric with respect to\nthe mean value of the radial velocities. Interestingly, there is one GC with vp \u2264 \u2212850 km\ns\u22121 measured in this study (ID 106 in Table 5 of Paper I). This GC is in the northern disk of\nM31 (Field 13 in Fig. 1 of Paper I), and has T1 =18.94, C\u2212T1 =1.83, and vp = \u2212890 \u00b1 38 km\ns\u22121 . Since the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the spectrum for this GC is only \u223c5 (measured\nusing H\u03b2 and Fe5015 lines), a higher S/N spectrum is needed to verify its radial velocity\nand membership clearly.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nThe velocity dispersion derived using the biweight scale of Beers et al. (1990) is esti\u22121\n\u22121\nmated to be \u03c3p = 185+7\nfor 211 GCs measured in this study, and \u03c3p = 178+4\n\u22126 km s\n\u22124 km s\nfor all 504 GCs in the master catalog. Both agree well within the errors.\nIn Figure 4, we show the spatial distribution of 504 GCs with measured velocities\noverlaid on a 4\u25e6 \u00d7 4\u25e6 optical image of M31 from the Digitized Sky Survey. The spatial\ndistribution of 211 GCs measured in this study is globally similar to that of the 293 GCs\nmeasured in the literature. However, the GCs measured in this study are mainly located\nin the outer disk of M31 since the spectroscopic observation for the outer disk was done\nrepeatedly (see Paper I for the configuration of the spectroscopic observations).\n\n2.2.\n\nSubsamples\n\nMetallicities of 199 GCs in M31 were derived from the line indices measured in the\nWIYN/Hydra spectra by Lee et al. (2007, in preparation, Paper III). We made subsamples\nbased on the metallicities and T1 magnitudes for 504 GCs in the master catalog for further\nanalysis. We combined the metallicity data of 176 GCs in Barmby et al. (2000) and 194\nGCs in Perrett et al. (2002) with our data of 199 GCs (Paper III) in order to include the\nmetallicity data in the master catalog. There are 32 objects in common between this study\nand Barmby et al. (2000), and 34 objects in common between this study and Perrett et al.\n(2002). We have compared our metallicity measurements with those in these two previous\nstudies for the common objects, as displayed in Figure 5. It shows that our measurements\nagree well with the published ones overall, while the scatter in the comparison between this\nstudy and Barmby et al. (2000) is smaller than that in the comparison between this study\nand Perrett et al. (2002). We also derive transformation relations between the measurement\nin this study, and those in Barmby et al. (2000) and in Perrett et al. (2002) using the GCs\nwith small measurement errors,\n\n[Fe/H]This\n[Fe/H]This\n\nstudy\n\nstudy\n\n= 0.92(\u00b10.02) [Fe/H]Barmby\n\net al.\n\n\u2212 0.11(\u00b10.02), rms = 0.19, N = 30,\n\n(6)\n\n= 0.87(\u00b10.03) [Fe/H]Perrett\n\net al.\n\n\u2212 0.12(\u00b10.03), rms = 0.20, N = 25.\n\n(7)\n\nThe measured metallicities for the GCs in Barmby et al. (2000) and Perrett et al.\n(2002) were transformed into our metallicity system using equations (6) and (7), and the\ntransformed metallicities were used for further analysis. We used our metallicity measurements for the common objects. Finally, we obtained metallicities for 431 GCs in total. The\ndetails of our metallicity data will be given in Paper III.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nWe present the metallicity distribution of M31 GCs in Figure 6(a). The KMM test\nbased on the algorithm of Ashman et al. (1994) yields the result that the hypothesis that a\nunimodal distribution fits the data better rather than a bimodal distribution can be rejected\nat a confidence level of 99.9%. The bimodal test results in the following two groups: the\nmetal-poor ([Fe/H]\u2264 \u22120.905) GCs (N = 310) with a mean value of [Fe/H]= \u22121.47 (\u03c3 = 0.37)\nand the metal-rich ([Fe/H]> \u22120.905) GCs (N = 121) with a mean value of [Fe/H]= \u22120.62\n(\u03c3 = 0.32). The KMM test with a trimodal distribution also rejects the hypothesis of a\nunimodal metallicity distribution at a confidence level of 99.8%. The trimodal test results\nin the following three groups: the metal-poor GCs (N = 183 GCs) with a mean value of\n[Fe/H]= \u22121.67 (\u03c3 = 0.29), the intermediate metallicity GCs (N = 155 GCs) with a mean\nvalue of [Fe/H]= \u22121.14 (\u03c3 = 0.26), and the metal-rich GCs (N = 93 GCs) with a mean value\nof [Fe/H]= \u22120.52 (\u03c3 = 0.27). Although there is no reason to reject the trimodal metallicity\ndistribution for M31 GCs (to be discussed in detail in Paper III), we use the two subsamples\nof metal-poor and metal-rich GCs from the bimodal distribution to increase the number of\nGCs per subsample for kinematic analysis in this study.\n\u22121\nWe derived the mean values of the radial velocities: vp = \u2212294+11\nfor 310 metal\u221211 km s\n+15\n\u22121\npoor GCs, and vp = \u2212250\u221214 km s for 121 metal-rich GCs. The value for the metal-poor\n\u22121\nGCs is consistent with that for the entire 504 GC sample (vp = \u2212285+8\n\u22128 km s ), but the\nvalue for the metal-rich GCs is significantly smaller than that for the metal-poor GCs, which\nwas seen earlier in Perrett et al. (2002).\n\nFor the velocity dispersion, we found that the dispersion for the metal-poor GCs (\u03c3p =\nkm s\u22121 ) is significantly larger than that of the metal-rich GCs (\u03c3p = 154+11\n\u22129 km\ns ). This is in contrast with the result of Perrett et al. (2002) that the dispersions for the\nmetal-poor and metal-rich GCs agree within the quoted errors (\u03c3p = 155 \u00b1 7 km s\u22121 for\nthe metal-poor GCs and \u03c3p = 146 \u00b1 12 km s\u22121 for the metal-rich GCs). We find that this\ndifference may be due to the fact that the sample used by Perrett et al. (2002) was derived\nmainly from the disk of M31, while ours are based on a much wider area, including a larger\nfraction of probable halo GCs.\n183+5\n\u22125\n\u22121\n\nThe luminosity function for M31 GCs is shown in Figure 6 (b). We used only 483 GCs\nfor which T1 magnitudes are available in our photometric catalog of M31 survey. Since the\nsurvey depth is not uniform across the galaxy due to varying background of stellar light,\nwe use only the GCs brighter than T1 = 18.5 to make subsamples based on T1 magnitudes.\nFinally, we divide the GCs into 201 bright (T1 \u2264 16.9) and 203 faint (16.9 < T1 \u2264 18.5) GCs\nso that the number of GCs in each subsample is similar.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n3.\n\nResults\n\nUsing the master catalog of 504 GCs in M31, we have investigated the kinematic properties of the M31 GC system for several cases of subsamples: all GCs, metal-poor and metal\nrich GCs, bright and faint GCs, and X-ray emitting GCs. Primary results of the kinematics\nof the M31 GC system derived in this study are summarized in Table 1.\n\n3.1.\n\nAll GCs\n\n3.1.1. Kinematic Properties\nIn Figure 7, we present the spatial distribution of M31 GCs with the measured velocity.\nHere we adopted as the systemic velocity of M31 the value derived for all GCs in the previous\nsection, \u2212285 \u00b1 8 km s\u22121 . Figure 7 shows clearly a rotation signature. The receding GCs,\nwith velocities greater than the systemic velocity of M31, and the approaching GCs, with\nvelocities less than the systemic velocity of M31, are spatially separated effectively by the\nminor axis, indicating a disk rotation. Interestingly, there are some GCs showing a retrograde\nrotation (filled circles at +X and open circles at \u2212X) that will be discussed in \u00a73.1.2. We\npresent the radial velocities for M31 GCs versus the projected radii along the major axis (X)\nand along the minor axis (Y) in Figure 7 (b) and (c), respectively. A linear least-squares fit,\npassing through (X, vp \u2212vM 31 ) = (0, 0), along the major axis results in vp \u2212vM 31 = 4.69+0.61\n\u22120.55 X\n+1.28\n\u22121\n\u22121\nkm s and vp \u2212 vM 31 = 0.31\u22121.17 Y km s , where X and Y are units of arcmin. The large\nvalue of the slope between vp \u2212vM 31 and X indicates a strong rotation of the M31 GC system\naround the minor axis, while the small value of the slope between vp \u2212 vM 31 and Y indicates\nno significant rotation around the major axis.\nIn Figure 8, we present the radial velocities of GCs as a function of the projected\ndistance along the major axis of M31 and the velocity histogram of the GCs for the samples\nof different distance bins along the minor axis in order to investigate any rotational variation\nalong the minor axis. The mean radial velocity in a distance bin of 10\u2032 is overlaid by a large\nsquare with an errorbar representing the velocity dispersion. We fit the mean radial velocities\nwith a straight line representing a solid-body rotation for the inner region. We select the\nappropriate boundary that gives the minimum \u03c7 value by moving the fitting boundary from\n10\u2032 to 50\u2032 symmetrically. Then, a flat rotation curve is connected to the solid-body rotation\ncurve at that radius. The rotation amplitude that is inclination-corrected, is estimated by\none-half of the velocity difference between the flat rotation curves. We also estimate the\nrotation amplitude using the velocity histogram for M31 GCs. We fit the observed velocity\nhistogram using the sum of two or three Gaussian functions. Then, the rotation amplitude\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nis represented by one-half of the velocity difference between the two Gaussian peaks - one is\nthe largest positive value and the other is the smallest negative value. We derive finally the\nrotation velocity corrected for inclination, vrot = vp,rot /sin i where vp,rot represents a projected\nrotation velocity. The rotation amplitude of all GCs in M31 estimated by fitting the rotation\n+39\n\u22121\ncurve is vrot \u2243 188+34\n\u221228 km s , while that from the velocity histogram is vrot \u223c 188\u221233 km\ns\u22121 . These two values agree very well. The uncertainties on these (and following) estimates\nrepresent 68% (1 \u03c3) confidence intervals. We computed the uncertainties using 1000 artificial\ndata sets constructed by randomly choosing GCs up to the number of GCs in the real data.\nThe fitting procedure is performed on the 1000 trial data sets, the results are sorted, and\nthe values corresponding to the 16th and 84th percentiles are identified. The uncertainties\nare defined as the offsets between these values and the values computed using the real data.\nWe have also derived the rotation-corrected velocity dispersion of the all GC sample, that\n\u22121\nis, the dispersion about the rotation curve shown in Figure 8: \u03c3p,r = 134+5\n\u22125 km s .\nThe velocity histogram for the thin disk |Y | < 1 kpc (d) shows not only two rotation\npeaks but also a velocity dispersion peak due to the central bulge of M31. The rotation\namplitudes decrease as the distance along the minor axis of M31 increases. Interestingly, the\nrotation amplitude is not zero even for the outermost samples at |Y | \u2265 5 kpc, although the\nsmall size of the sample for outer GCs leads to a large uncertainty (Figure 8 (i) and (j)).\nThis result indicates that the halo (or extended bulge) of M31 may be not totally\npressure-supported but is rotating as well. This result is consistent with the idea that the\nM31 halo is dominated by a moderately rotating large bulge rather than by a non-rotating\nhalo far from the plane, which is based on the kinematics of PNe in M31 (Hurley-Keller et al.\n2004). However, this does not necessarily indicate that there is no classical halo in M31 (see\nIrwin et al. (2005); Kalirai et al. (2006)), as discussed in the next section.\nOn the other hand, the rotation-corrected velocity dispersion of the GCs increases from\n\u22121\n\u22121\nat |Y | \u2265 5 kpc. Thus the velocity\n\u03c3p,r = 119+9\nat |Y | < 1 kpc to \u03c3p,r = 151+9\n\u22128 km s\n\u22129 km s\ndispersion becomes about twice as large as the nominal rotation amplitude at |Y | \u2265 5 kpc,\nshowing that pressure support is much larger than rotation support in the outer halo.\n\n3.1.2. Friendless GCs\nAlthough the GC system in M31 is dominated by disk rotation, there are also seen some\nGCs that do not follow the disk rotation. To identify the GCs that do not follow the disk\nrotation, we select 'friendless' GCs adopting the method used for the study of the kinematics\nof M31 PNe in Merrett et al. (2003).\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nIn summary, we select the friendless GCs that deviate from the mean velocity of neighbor\nGCs on the sky more than n \u00d7 \u03c3, where \u03c3 is the velocity dispersion of neighbor GCs. The\nnumber of GCs that defines the local environment is taken to be \u223c [Nall GCs (= 504)]1/2 , and\nn = 2 is used in this study. Among all 504 GCs, we find 50 friendless GCs. The spatial\ndistribution of the friendless GCs is shown in Figure 9. It is seen that they are located\nmostly in the disk. However, most of them are located in the quadrants of retro-grade\nrotation (the first and third) in the vp \u2212 vM 31 versus X diagram. The friendless GCs in the\nsecond and fourth quadrants have mostly velocities larger than the largest velocities of the\nGCs following the major disk rotation. These friendless GCs may have different origin from\nthe main population of GCs following disk rotation.\nTo highlight the kinematics of the friendless GCs, we plot, in Figure 10, the spatial\ndistribution of only the friendless GCs with the symbol size scaled according to their velocity\ndeviations from the systemic velocity of M31. Interestingly, it appears that the friendless\nGCs rotate around the major axis of M31 unlike the rotation around the minor axis for the\ndisk population.\nMerrett et al. (2003) suggested that the friendless PNe in their sample may link to the\nSouthern Stream and the Northern Spur since the positions and velocities of the friendless\nPNe are consistent with the two streams. Recently, other stellar substructures in M31 were\nfound by several authors (Ferguson et al. 2002; McConnachie et al. 2004; Fardal et al.\n2006b). Since the kinematic information on stellar substructures in M31 is available, it\nwould be interesting to compare the kinematics of the friendless GCs with those of stellar\nsubstructures, which may provide a clue to understand the motion and origin of the friendless\nGCs, but it is beyond the scope of this paper.\nIn Figure 11, we show the photometric properties of T1 magnitudes and (C \u2212 T1 ) colors,\nand spectroscopic metallicities for the friendless GCs. The friendless GCs have a mean T1\nmagnitude of < T1 >= 17.13 mag with a deviation of \u03c3T1 = 1.47 mag, which is similar\nto the values of < T1 >= 17.09 mag with a deviation of \u03c3T1 = 1.30 mag for the normal\nGCs. The mean metallicities are also similar between the friendless and normal GCs, but\nthe mean (C \u2212 T1 ) color for the friendless GCs (< C \u2212 T1 >= 1.66 mag with \u03c3C\u2212T1 = 0.42)\nis slightly redder than that for the normal GCs (< C \u2212 T1 >= 1.55 mag with \u03c3C\u2212T1 =\n0.60). We used a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test to determine whether the friendless and\nnormal GC populations were drawn from the same distribution. The hypothesis that the two\ndistributions are extracted from the same parent population can be rejected at the confidence\nlevel of \u223c 86% for the T1 magnitude distribution, \u223c 91% for (C \u2212 T1 ) color distribution, and\n\u223c 1% for the metallicity distribution. Therefore, only T1 magnitudes and (C \u2212 T1 ) colors\nappear to be slightly different. However, this problem needs to be investigated further using\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nthe reddening-corrected magnitudes and colors.\n\n3.2.\n\nMetal-Poor and Metal-Rich GCs\n\nFigure 12 shows the spatial and radial distributions of the 310 metal-poor and 121\nmetal-rich GCs. The most striking difference in the radial distribution between the two\nsubpopulations is that the metal-rich GCs show a much stronger central concentration than\nthe metal-poor GCs, which is consistent with the results based on the smaller data set in\nHuchra et al. (1991) and Perrett et al. (2002). In particular the radial distribution of the\nmetal-rich GCs show a very narrow peak with a half width of about 10 arcmin, showing that\nthey belong to the central bulge of M31. Median values of the absolute distances along the\nmajor axis for the metal-poor and metal-rich GCs are 23.1\u2032 and 16.0\u2032 , respectively, and those\nalong the minor axis for the metal-poor and metal-rich GCs are 9.3\u2032 and 4.7\u2032 , respectively.\nIn addition, a small number of metal-rich GCs are found in the outer region, even at about\n70\u2032 from the major axis. There are 9 GCs within the boundary of the standard diameter\nin NGC 205. All of these GCs are metal-poor, as found by earlier studies (Perrett et al.\n2003).\nTo highlight the difference in spatial distribution between the metal-poor and metalrich GCs, we plot, in Figure 13, the number density contours for the metallicity subsamples.\nSeveral features are noted in Figure 13. First, the spatial distribution of the metal-rich\nGCs shows a much stronger central concentration than that of the metal-poor GCs, as seen\nbefore. Second, the spatial distribution of the metal-rich GCs shows almost circular structure\nin the central region of M31, while that of the metal-poor GCs shows an extended structure\nelongated along the major axis with a similar ellipticity to that of the M31 disk. This\ndifference is less clearly seen in the sample of bright GCs (T1 < 17). Third, there are several\nsubstructures in both subpopulations. The most notable metal-poor substructures are one\nin the region \u221240\u2032 < X < \u221220\u2032 and Y \u2248 \u221210\u2032 , and one in the region \u221260\u2032 < X < \u221240\u2032\nand Y \u2248 0\u2032 . These two correspond to the GC groups IDs 10 and 11, respectively, in\nPerrett et al. (2003). These are close to, but not consistent with, the position of And VIII.\nOne metal-rich GC and four metal-poor GCs are found within the standard diameter of And\nVIII. The substructure of metal-poor GCs in NGC 205 corresponds to the GC group ID 5\nin Perrett et al. (2003). Two notable substructures among the metal-rich GCs are on the\nmajor axis: one at X \u2248 \u221225\u2032 and the other at X \u2248 20\u2032 . These correspond, respectively, to\nthe GC group ID 8 and the sum of IDs 2 and 3, respectively, in Perrett et al. (2003). One\nsubstructure containing both metal-poor GCs and metal-rich GCs at X \u2248 \u221210\u2032 and Y \u2248 20\u2032\n(seen only in the bright GCs) corresponds to the GC group ID 7 in Perrett et al. (2003).\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nTherefore most of the GC groups in Perrett et al. (2003) are confirmed in this study.\nIn Figure 14, we present the radial velocities for the metal-poor and metal-rich GCs\nversus the projected radii along the major axis (X) and the minor axis (Y). A linear leastsquares fit, passing through (X, vp \u2212vM 31 ) = (0, 0), along the major axis results in vp \u2212vM 31 =\n\u22121\n\u22121\n+5.12+0.46\nfor the metal-poor GCs and vp \u2212 vM 31 = +5.28+1.52\nfor the\n\u22120.49 X km s\n\u22121.54 X km s\nmetal-rich GCs. A least-squares fit along the minor axis results in vp \u2212 vM 31 = \u22120.20+1.60\n\u22121.47 Y\n+3.10\n\u22121\n\u22121\nkm s for the metal-poor GCs and vp \u2212 vM 31 = +1.46\u22122.34 Y km s for the metal-rich\nGCs. As known previously, both the metal-poor and metal-rich GCs show a strong and very\nsimilar rotation around the minor axis and no or a weak rotation around the major axis.\nThe kinematic difference between the two subsamples is not significant at this stage.\nTo investigate any kinematic difference between the two subsamples in detail, we plot,\nin Figure 15, the radial velocities for the metal-poor and metal-rich GCs as a function of the\nprojected distance along the major axis of M31 and the velocity histograms. We also plot the\nmean radial velocities of the GCs in a distance bin of 10\u2032 along the major axis. We estimate\nthe rotation amplitudes for the two subsamples using the same fitting procedure applied in\nFigure 8. The rotation amplitude estimated by fitting the rotation curves (left panels) shows\n\u22121\nthat the rotation of the metal-rich GCs (vrot = 191+34\n\u221237 km s ) is indistinguishable from that\n\u22121\nof the metal-poor GCs (vrot = 193+44\n\u221241 km s ). However, Perrett et al. (2002) found that\nthe rotation of the metal-rich GCs (vrot = 160 \u00b1 19 km s\u22121 ) is slightly stronger than that of\nthe metal-poor GCs (vrot = 131 \u00b1 13 km s\u22121 ).\nIt is worth noting that the rotation curve in the metal-poor GCs is asymmetric at\n|X| > 30 arcmin. The metal-poor GCs at |X| < 30 arcmin follow a solid-body rotation,\nwhile those at |X| > 30 arcmin do not. Since the distribution of the metal-poor GCs is more\nextended than the metal-rich GCs, the asymmetric rotation curve is seen only for the metalpoor GCs. Contours in Figure 15 show clearly this asymmetry at \u221260\u2032 < X < \u221230\u2032 where\nthe mean radial velocities are larger than the opposite end (at 30\u2032 < X < 60\u2032). Note also\nthat there is a significant substructure at X \u2248 \u221225\u2032 with vp \u2212 vM 31 \u2248 \u2212200 km s\u22121 , found in\na wide-field survey. This corresponds to the most notable metal-poor substructure described\nabove. Therefore these substructures are distinguishable not only in spatial distribution but\nalso in kinematics. This substructure may be related with the Southern Stream emanating\nfrom the southwest disk of M31 found in a wide field survey of red giants by Ibata et al.\n(2001).\nIn addition, we derived the rotation amplitude from the velocity histogram of the metalpoor GCs (panel (b)). The rotation amplitude of the metal-poor GCs is estimated to be\n\u22121\nvrot = 151+8\n\u22128 km s , which is slightly smaller than, but agrees within the error to, the value\nderived from the vp \u2212 vM 31 vs X diagram above. The velocity histogram of the metal-rich\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nGCs shows a single strong peak, showing that the sample is dominated by the GCs in the\ncentral bulge. So we did not try to derive a rotation velocity for the metal-rich GCs from the\nvelocity histogram. We have derived the rotation-corrected velocity dispersions: \u03c3p,r = 129+7\n\u22126\n\u22121\nkm s\u22121 for the metal-poor GCs, and \u03c3p,r = 121+9\nkm\ns\nfor\nthe\nmetal-rich\nGCs.\nThus\nthe\n\u221210\nrotation-corrected velocity dispersion for the metal-poor GCs is very similar to that for the\nmetal-rich GCs.\nIn Figures 16 and 17, we also present the radial velocities of the metal-poor and metalrich GCs as a function of the projected distance along the major axis of M31 and the velocity\nhistogram of the GCs for the samples of different distance bins along the minor axis in order\nto investigate the rotational variation along the minor axis. The metal-poor GCs show that\nthe rotation velocity is roughly decreasing with increasing distance from the major axis, but\nthe uncertainties are too large to derive a reliable rotational velocity for the outer region at\n|Y | > 3 kpc. The metal-rich GCs show a similar trend to that of the metal-poor GCs at\n|Y | < 3 kpc, but they suffer more from the small number statistics problem.\nThe rotation-corrected velocity dispersion of the metal-poor GCs increases from \u03c3p,r =\n\u22121\nkm s\u22121 at |Y | < 1 kpc to \u03c3p,r = 145+11\nat |Y | \u2265 5 kpc. Thus the velocity\n\u221211 km s\ndispersion becomes about twice as large as the rotation amplitude at |Y | \u2265 5 kpc, showing\nthat pressure support is much larger than rotation support in the outer halo of M31.\n119+17\n\u221215\n\n3.3.\n\nBright and Faint GCs\n\nIn Figure 18, we show the spatial distribution of the bright and faint GCs. It is seen\nthat the bright GCs are more centrally concentrated than the faint GCs. Median values of\nthe absolute distances along the major axis for the 201 bright and 203 faint GCs are 14.9\u2032\nand 22.2\u2032 , respectively, and those along the minor axis for the bright and faint GCs are\n7.1\u2032 and 8.0\u2032 , respectively. Thus, the difference between the two subsamples in the spatial\ndistribution along the major axis is significant, while that along the minor axis is not. This\nis mainly due to the fact that a significant fraction of bright GCs are located in the central\nbulge of M31 and that a large number of faint GCs in the central region of M31 were not\ndetected in the current surveys.\nWe present the radial velocities of the bright and faint GCs versus the projected radii\nalong the major axis (X) and along the minor axis (Y) in Figure 19. The linear least-squares\nfits, passing through (X, vp \u2212 vM 31 ) = (0, 0), along the major axis result in vp \u2212 vM 31 =\n\u22121\n\u22121\n+4.98+0.98\nfor the bright GCs and vp \u2212 vM 31 = +5.06+0.30\nfor the faint\n\u22120.96 X km s\n\u22120.30 X km s\n+1.66\nGCs. The least-squares fit along the minor axis results in vp \u2212 vM 31 = +0.18\u22121.55Y km s\u22121\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\n\u22121\nfor the bright GCs and vp \u2212 vM 31 = \u22120.79+1.17\nfor the faint GCs. Both the bright\n\u22121.16 Y km s\nand faint GCs show a strong rotation around the minor axis and no or weak rotation around\nthe major axis. The kinematic difference between the two subsamples is not significant.\n\nWe also plot the radial velocities for the bright and faint GCs as a function of the\nprojected distance along the major axis of M31 and the velocity histograms in Figure 20.\nWe estimate the rotation amplitudes for the two subsamples using the same fitting procedure\napplied in Figure 8. The rotation amplitudes estimated by fitting the rotation curves (left\n\u22121\npanels) show that the rotation of the faint GCs (vrot = 209+21\n\u221215 km s ) is stronger than that\n\u22121\nof the bright GCs (vrot = 129+35\n\u221235 km s ). In addition, the rotation amplitude from the\n\u22121\nvelocity histogram shows again that the rotation of the faint GCs (vrot = 178+23\n\u221223 km s )\n\u22121\nis stronger than that of the bright GCs (vrot = 144+43\n\u221246 km s ). The difference in rotation\namplitudes between the bright and faint GCs is closely related to the difference in their\nspatial distributions. Since the faint GCs are more extended along the major axis than the\nbright GCs, the rotation amplitude of the faint GCs is estimated to be larger than that of\nthe bright GCs. It is noted that the rotation-corrected velocity dispersion for the bright\n\u22121\n\u22121\nGCs, \u03c3p,r = 146+7\nis much larger than that for the faint GCs, \u03c3p,r = 107+8\n\u22127 km s\n\u22128 km s .\n\n3.4.\n\nGCs with X-ray detection\n\nTo investigate the kinematic properties of X-ray emitting GCs in M31, we cross-correlated\nthe GCs and GC candidates from the optical survey with the X-ray sources in M31. We\nused as the optical source list, the catalog of 1778 GC candidates prepared combining our\nsurvey, RBC2, Huxor et al. (2005) and Mackey et al. (2007).\nWe made a master catalog of X-ray sources in M31 by combining 560 sources in the\nROSAT survey (Supper et al. 2001), 204 sources in the Chandra survey (Kong et al. 2002),\n856 sources in the XMM-Newton survey (Pietsch et al. 2005), and 62 X-ray emitting GCs\nin Fan et al. (2005). If a GC candidate in the optical survey lies within a circle of 2\u03c3\npositional uncertainty of an X-ray source, we regard it as a match. We used 1\u03c3 positional\nuncertainty for the ROSAT sources due to its large positional uncertainty (5\u221248 arcsec of\n1\u03c3 with a median value of 7 arcsec). In addition, we matched optical GC candidates with 62\nX-ray emitting GCs in Fan et al. (2005) using the identification of GCs, since Fan et al.\n(2005) presented only a catalog of X-ray emitting GCs.\nFinally, we identify 56 GCs and GC candidates (classes 1 and 2 in Paper I and RBC2)\nwith X-ray detections (40 genuine GCs including 39 GCs with measured velocities, and 16\nGC candidates). There are 13 GCs that were identified as X-ray emitting GCs in Fan et al.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n(2005), but were not included in our combined optical GC catalog. Therefore, we increase\nthe number of X-ray emitting GCs in M31 by 69, including 13 GCs that were not presented\nin our GC catalog. For further kinematic analysis, we use only the homogeneous data set of\n56 X-ray emitting GCs and GC candidates presented in our optical GC catalog.\nWe show, in Figure 21, the spatial distribution of 39 genuine GCs with X-ray detection\nand measured velocity in company with 1 GC and 16 GC candidates with X-ray detection but\nno measured velocity. It is difficult to make strong conclusions about the spatial distribution\nof the X-ray emitting GCs since the X-ray surveys did not uniformly cover the whole region\nin M31. However, it is clearly seen that a large number of the X-ray emitting GCs are\nlocated in the central bulge region of M31 and that they show a large velocity dispersion.\nIn addition, it appears that the majority of X-ray emitting GCs follow the disk rotation of\nM31.\nIn Figure 22, we show the photometric properties of the X-ray emitting GCs compared\nwith that of all 504 GCs. We used the KS test to determine whether the X-ray emitting\nand the entire GC population were drawn from the same distribution. Interestingly, the\nhypothesis that the two distributions are extracted from the same parent population can be\nrejected at the confidence level of \u223c 99% for the distribution of T1 magnitude, (C \u2212T1 ) color,\nand the metallicity. This result based on the analysis of the expanded sample of M31 X-ray\nemitting GCs confirms the previous results (Bellazzini et al. 1995; Di Stefano et al. 2002;\nTrudolyubov & Priedhorsky 2004; Fan et al. 2005). The properties of X-ray emitting GCs\nin M31 are consistent with those of GCs in early-type galaxies: redder, more metal-rich, and\nbrighter GCs are more likely to be detected as X-ray emitting GCs (Sarazin et al. 2003;\nKim et al. 2006; Sivakoff et al. 2006).\n\n3.5.\n\nRotation Curve\n\nRotation curves are useful for inferring the amount and distribution of underlying dark\nmatter in galaxies (e.g., Sofue & Rubin 2001). For M31, there are several studies to derive\nthe rotation curve using various tracers: HII regions (Rubin & Ford 1970; Kent 1989), HI\n(Braun 1991; Carignan et al. 2006, 2007), CO (Loinard et al. 1995), PNe (Merrett et al.\n2006), and GCs (Perrett et al. 2002).\nTo obtain the rotation curve of M31 using the sample of 504 GCs in this study, we first\nselected 454 GCs following the M31 disk rotation by rejecting 50 friendless GCs defined in\n\u00a73.1.2. Then, we selected 75 GCs with |Y /X| < 0.5 and |Y | < 0.6 kpc that are dominated by\nthe rotational motion, since the inclination of M31 to the line of sight is as high as i = 77.7\u25e6 .\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nWe display the rotation curve using the selected GCs in Figure 23. We plot the rotation\nvelocity corrected for inclination, vrot = (vp \u2212 vM 31 )(R/X)/sin i, where X is the projected\ndistance along the major axis of M31 and R is the deprojected radius in the plane of the\ndisk, R = [X 2 +(Y /cos i)2 ]1/2 . For each GC, we use the nearest 21 GCs to estimate the mean\nvelocity, taken as the rotation velocity at that radius, and to estimate the velocity dispersion.\nWe stop the calculation when the number of the nearest GCs is less than 21 (R < 8.9\u2032 and\nR > 46.4\u2032 ). Typical 1\u03c3 uncertainties using the bootstrap procedure for the rotation velocity\nand for the dispersion are 12 km s\u22121 and 8 km s\u22121 , respectively. For comparison, we derive\nalso the rotation curve of PNe using the velocity data in Merrett et al. (2006) by applying\nthe same procedure as above. For PNe, typical 1\u03c3 uncertainties for the rotation velocity and\nfor the dispersion are both 4 km s\u22121 .\nIt appears that the rotation curve of the GCs in this study agrees well with those of\nother tracers in the range R = 20\u2032 \u2212 45\u2032 . However, the rotation curve of PNe derived\nusing the velocity data of Merrett et al. (2006) is different from the other profiles in the\nsimilar radial range. The rotation velocity for PNe at R = 20 \u2212 60\u2032 is on average about 50\nkm s\u22121 smaller compared with those of other tracers, as seen in Figure 33 of Merrett et al.\n(2006). They showed that the presence of significant random velocities at all radii account\nfor the asymmetric drift between the rotational motion and the local circular speed for PNe.\nIn the inner region (R < 20\u2032 ) of M31, the rotation curves are significantly different from\neach other. A careful study is needed for the rotation curves in the inner region due to the\ncontribution of the non-circular motion of the bulge and the projection effect of an inclined\nM31 disk.\nThe velocity dispersion profiles for the GCs and the PNe are similar in general except\nfor the inner region at R < 15\u2032 . The velocity dispersion decreases from \u223c 120 km s\u22121 at\nR = 10\u2032 to \u223c 80 km s\u22121 at R = 30\u2032 , and changes little in the outermost area. The velocity\ndispersion of the GCs seems to increase again at R \u2248 45\u2032 , while that of the PNe keeps slowly\ndecreasing with R. More data on the GCs further out in the halo are needed to confirm this\ndifference, which can probe whether a pressure-supported hot halo exists or not in M31.\n\n3.6.\n\nMass of M31\n\nWe have estimated the mass of M31 from the kinematic information of the GCs in this\nstudy using two methods: 'Projected Mass Estimator (PME)' and 'Tracer Mass Estimator\n(TME)'. PME was introduced by Bahcall & Tremaine (1981) for the case of test particles\norbiting a point mass, and later was extended by Heisler et al. (1985) for those tracing the\ntotal mass. The mass based on PME is given by\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n\nfp X 2\nv Rp,i ,\n=\nNG i=1 i\nN\n\nMPME\n\n(8)\n\nwhere N is the number of objects, G is the gravitational constant, Rp is the projected\ngalactocentric radius, and v is the line-of-sight velocity relative to the systemic velocity of\nthe galaxy. The constant fp = 32/\u03c0 is used for the objects with an isotropic orbit, while\n11\nfp = 64/\u03c0 for the objects with a radial orbit. We obtain MPME = 5.5+0.4\n\u22120.3 \u00d7 10 M\u2299 using all\n\u2032\n504 GCs out to a radius of 242 \u223c 55 kpc with an assumption of isotropic orbits.\nLater Evans et al. (2003) introduced a new method of TME for the case that the\ntracer population such as GCs and PNe does not follow the underlying mass distribution\ndominated by dark matter. They applied the TME to 321 GCs of Perrett et al. (2002),\nand obtained, for Rp \u223c 100 kpc, MTME = 1.2 \u00d7 1012 M\u2299 that is composed of a rotation\ncontribution, Mrot = 3 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 and of a pressure contribution, Mpress = 9 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 .\nSimilarly, Galleti et al. (2006) obtained a larger mass of MTME = 2.4 \u00d7 1012 M\u2299 using the\nTME with the expanded sample of 349 GCs. In this study, we first select 301 metal-poor GCs\nconsidered to be halo GCs, and choose a radial range where the surface number density of the\nhalo GCs falls off as a power law. The surface number density of our metal-poor GCs follows\napproximately a power law Rp\u22123 beyond 30\u2032 , similar to that of Evans et al. (2003). Finally,\n146 halo GCs in the range of projected radius, Rp = 30\u2032 \u2212 152\u2032 (6.7 \u2212 34.2 kpc) are selected.\nWe set \u03b1 = 0 (isothermal-like galaxy), \u03b3 = 4, Rp,in = 6.7 kpc, and Rp,out = 100 kpc using\nthe same assumptions as in Evans et al. (2003). Then, we obtain for Rp \u223c 100 kpc, the\n11\ntotal mass of M31, MTME = 19.2+1.4\n\u22121.3 \u00d7 10 M\u2299 that is composed of a rotation contribution,\n+1.4\n11\n11\nMrot = 6.2+0.6\n\u22120.6 \u00d7 10 M\u2299 , and of a pressure contribution, Mpress = 13.1\u22121.3 \u00d7 10 M\u2299 .\nTo compare our estimation with the results in the literature, we plot the various dynamical mass estimates using GCs (Hartwick & Sargent 1974; van den Bergh 1981; Federici et al.\n1993; Evans & Wilkinson 2000; Perrett et al. 2002; Evans et al. 2003; Galleti et al. 2006),\nsatellite galaxies (Courteau & van den Bergh 1999; Evans & Wilkinson 2000; C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al.\n2000), and streams (Fardal et al. 2006a) of M31 in Figure 24. In addition, several profiles\nof the mass model for M31 are plotted (Widrow et al. 2003; Ibata et al. 2004; Seigar et al.\n2006; Geehan et al. 2006). The mass estimate based on PME derived in this study agrees\nwell with other observational estimates by Evans & Wilkinson (2000); Galleti et al. (2006)\nand two mass models by Widrow et al. (2003); Seigar et al. (2006).\nHowever, the mass estimates based on TME derived in this study and in Galleti et al.\n(2006) are larger than other estimates, and they are also larger than any models. If the TME\nis correct, the mass model of M31 needs a revision to a larger mass. This is also consistent\nwith the Majewski et al. (2007)'s suggestion based on the study of a new dwarf galaxy,\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nAndXIV. Noting that AndXIV shows a large velocity of \u2212203 km s\u22121 relative to M31 at a\nprojected galactocentric distance of 162 kpc, Majewski et al. (2007) suggested that recent\nmass models of M31 need a revision to larger, if AndXIV is bound to M31. Similar discussion\non the increase of the Milky Way Galaxy's mass based on the most distant satellite (d = 270\nkpc), the Leo I dwarf spheroidal galaxy, was given in Lee et al. (1993).\n\n4.\n4.1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nA dominant bulge versus a wimpy halo in M31?\n\nThe existence of a halo in M31 has been controversial. While Huchra et al. (1991)\nsuggested that the metal-poor GCs in M31 show little evidence of rotation, indicating that\nthey belong to the halo of M31, other studies based on surface photometry, counts of red\ngiant branch stars, and counts of PNe along the minor axis of M31 found an extended\nbulge, but no evidence of any halo component in M31 (Pritchet & van den Bergh 1994;\nMould & Kristian 1986; Hurley-Keller et al. 2004; Irwin et al. 2005; Merrett et al. 2006).\nHowever, recent studies covering a very wide field of M31 are finding evidence for a huge halo\nin M31 (Irwin et al. 2005; Guhathakurta et al. 2005; Chapman et al. 2006; Kalirai et al.\n2006; Gilbert et al. 2006; Ibata et al. 2007) as well as a vast extended disk reaching about\n40 kpc from the center of M31 (Ibata et al. 2005).\nIrwin et al. (2005) presented a minor-axis surface brightness profile reaching out to a\nprojected radius of 4\u25e6 (\u2248 55 kpc), combining surface photometry and faint red giant star\ncounts. They found that the minor-axis profile can be fit by a de Vaucouleurs law with\neffective bulge radius Reff = 0\u25e6 .10 (1.4 kpc) out to a projected radius of 1\u25e6 .4 (\u2248 20 kpc),\nand that there is a separate component beyond 1\u25e6 .4 that can be fit by either a power law of\nindex about \u20132.3 or an exponential law of scale length 14 kpc. One thing interesting about\nthis component is that it has the same color as the inner region, indicating that it has a\nsimilar metallicity to that of the bulge (assuming the two components have the same age).\nIn addition, the photometry of remote fields along the minor axis of M31 showed that most\nstars in these fields have unexpectedly high metallicity, [m/H]\u223c \u22120.5 ([Fe/H]\u223c \u22120.8) while\nthere are some metal-poor stars as well (Mould & Kristian 1986; Durrell, Harris, & Pritchet\n2001). Thus there are two components in the outer region of M31 that are distinguished in\nstructure, but not in metallicity. We may say from the results based on stars that M31 has\na huge dominant bulge reaching out to 4\u25e6 , or that M31 has two bulges: an inner bulge (out\nto 1\u25e6 .4) and an outer bulge (out to 4\u25e6 ). Even the inner bulge is much larger than the central\nbulge in our Galaxy, and the outer bulge may be called a halo.\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nThe progenitors of PNe are low to intermediate mass stars so that they are often considered as a good tracer for old stellar populations. For example, the radial number density\nprofiles of PNe in M31 show excellent agreement with the R-band surface brightness profiles\nof the stellar bulge and disk (Walterbos & Kennicutt 1987; Merrett et al. 2006). In particular, the number density profile of PNe along the minor axis of M31 is consistent with the R1/4\nprofile out to one degree (Merrett et al. 2006; Hurley-Keller et al. 2004). Merrett et al.\n(2006) pointed out that there is little excess of PNe over the R1/4 profile even at \u223c10 Ref f\n(one degree), indicating no separate halo component. This is also consistent with the result based on the surface brightness profile along the minor axis (Pritchet & van den Bergh\n1994; Irwin et al. 2005). Considering the rotating kinematics of the outer PNe at |Y | > 6\nkpc in M31 as well as the above points, Hurley-Keller et al. (2004) suggested that the bulge\nis the most dominating component in M31, while a nonrotating, pressure-supported halo is,\nif any, only a very minor component of M31.\nIn general, or at least in our Galaxy, metal-poor GCs are considered as a tracer of the\nhalo, while metal-rich GCs belong to the bulge or thick disk like the PNe, although the\nbulge does have some metal-poor GCs (Harris 1996). Note that the kinematics of 17 old\nstar clusters in M33, irrespective of their metallicity, show evidence for the existence of a hot\nhalo in M33 (Chandar et al. 2002). Therefore we may use metal-poor GCs to investigate the\nproperties of any halo in M31. The kinematics of the metal-poor GCs along the major axis at\n|Y | < 1 kpc show a rotation as strong as the metal-rich GCs. The rotation amplitude of the\nmetal-poor GCs decreases with increasing distance from the major axis, and the metal-poor\nGCs show some rotation (60 \u223c 100 km s\u22121 ) even far from the major axis at |Y | > 5 kpc.\nThese results are consistent with those of Perrett et al. (2002), but not with Huchra et al.\n(1991).\nHowever, the rotation-corrected velocity dispersion for the metal-poor GCs is about\ntwice as large as the rotation amplitude in the outer region at |Y | > 5 kpc. The rotationcorrected velocity dispersion for the metal-poor GCs at |Y | > 5 kpc in M31, \u03c3p,r = 145+11\n\u221211\n\u22121\nkm s , is comparable to that of the metal-poor GCs in the Galactic halo at RGC > 4\nkpc, \u03c3 = 123 km s\u22121 given by C\u00f4t\u00e9 (1999). Considering that the spatial distribution of\nthe metal-poor GCs in M31 is much more extended than that of the metal-rich GCs and\nthat the velocity dispersion of the metal-poor GCs in the outer region of M31 is about\ntwo times larger than the rotation amplitude, we conclude that there is a dynamically hot\nhalo in M31 that is rotating but primarily pressure-supported. This is consistent with the\ndiscovery of a pressure-supported metal-poor stellar halo based on the observations of red\ngiant branch stars at radii from 10 kpc to 165 kpc (Chapman et al. 2006; Gilbert et al.\n2006; Kalirai et al. 2006). Chapman et al. (2006) found from the analysis of a large sample\nof red giant branch stars: (a) there is seen a stellar halo component with low metallicity (\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\n[Fe/H]\u223c \u22121.4 ) at radii from 10 to 70 kpc, (b) there is little radial gradient of metallicity,\n(c) there is no significant evidence for rotation, and (d) the velocity dispersion of this metalpoor halo can be represented by \u03c3v (Rp ) = 152 \u2212 0.90Rp km s\u22121 where Rp is a projected\ngalactocentric distance in units of kpc.\nIn Figure 25 we display the radial variation of the mean metallicity for the metal-poor\nGCs in comparison with that for the red giant branch stars given by Kalirai et al. (2006).\nA few features are noted in Figure 25: (a) the mean metallicity for the metal-poor GCs\nis much lower than that for the red giant branch stars at the same distance from the M31\ncenter; (b) the mean metallicity for the metal-poor GCs in the inner region is similar to\nthat for the red giant branch stars much further out at Rp \u2248 80 kpc that was considered to\nbe the part of the stellar halo by Kalirai et al. (2006); and (c) the mean metallicity of the\nmetal-poor GCs shows little radial dependence: [Fe/H]= \u22121.48 \u00b1 0.27 at R = 7.1 kpc to\n[Fe/H]= \u22121.62 \u00b1 0.25 at R = 25.5 kpc (if we use all GCs, we obtain [Fe/H]= \u22121.24 \u00b1 0.27\nat R = 6.7 kpc to [Fe/H]= \u22121.62 \u00b1 0.25 at R = 25.5 kpc). These show that the metal-poor\nGCs are tracing the metal-poor halo, even in the inner region of M31.\nRecently Ibata et al. (2007) found a faint, smooth and extremely extended halo component, reaching out to 150 kpc, about three times larger than the limit studied by Irwin et al.\n(2005). In addition, they found, from the photometry of red giant branch stars, that the\nmajority of the stars in this extended halo are metal-poor, in contrast to the Irwin et al.\n(2005) finding that its integrated color is similar to the inner bulge. In spite of its huge size,\nthe total luminosity of this halo derived assuming that it is symmetric is found to be \u223c 109\nL\u2299 , similar to the stellar halo of our Galaxy. Therefore it will be interesting to find GCs and\ninvestigate their kinematics in this outer halo of M31.\n\n4.2.\n\nComparison of GC and PN kinematics\n\nPNe are an excellent tool for studying the kinematics of the bulge and halo of a galaxy.\nRecently huge data sets for the PNe in M31 were published by Merrett et al. (2006);\nHalliday et al. (2006). How do the kinematics of the GCs compare with that of the PNe\nin M31? We have derived the kinematics of about 2500 PNe using the same method to the\ndata given by Merrett et al. (2006), as used for the analysis of the GC data, which are\nsummarized in Table 2.\nFigure 26 displays radial velocities (dots) versus the projected distances along the major axis (X) and the velocity histogram for the PNe in M31 based on the data given by\nMerrett et al. (2006), like Figure 8 for GCs. We plot also the mean radial velocity and its\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\ndispersion of the PNe in a distance bin of 10 \u2032 along the major axis. Velocity histograms of\nPNe are displayed with Gaussian fits as in Figure 8. Figure 26 shows that the rotational\nproperties of the PNe are very similar to those of the GCs. The rotational amplitudes of all\n\u22121\n\u22121\nPNe are vrot \u2243 187+12\nfrom the rotation curve, and vrot \u2243 198+58\nfrom the\n\u221213 km s\n\u221233 km s\nvelocity histogram, which are similar to those of GCs derived in this study, vrot \u2243 188+34\n\u221228 km\n+39\n\u22121\n\u22121\ns , and vrot \u223c 188\u221233 km s , respectively. The rotation amplitudes of the PNe decrease as\nthe distance along the minor axis of M31 increases, but the rotation amplitude is not zero\neven for the outermost samples at |Y | \u2265 5 kpc, which are consistent with the results based\non GCs derived in this study.\nThe rotation-corrected velocity dispersion for all PNe is estimated to be \u03c3p,r = 94+1\n\u22121\nkm s\u22121 , which is much smaller than that for all GCs, \u03c3p,r \u223c 134 \u00b1 5 km s\u22121 . The rotation\u22121\ncorrected velocity dispersion for the PNe at |Y | < 1 kpc is \u03c3p,r = 97+2\n\u22122 km s , and it\n\u22121\nbecomes smaller and shows little variation with |Y |: \u03c3p,r = 75+2\nfor 1 \u2264 |Y | < 3\n\u22122 km s\n+4\n+3\n\u22121\n\u22121\nkpc, \u03c3p,r = 88\u22124 km s for 3 \u2264 |Y | < 5 kpc, and \u03c3p,r = 79\u22123 km s for |Y | \u2265 5 kpc.\nThus the rotation-corrected velocity dispersion for the PNe at |Y | < 1 kpc is consistent with\n\u22121\nthat for the metal-rich GCs at |Y | < 1 kpc, \u03c3p,r = 107+24\n\u221222 km s . We cannot compare the\nkinematics of the PNe at |Y | > 1 kpc with that of the metal-rich GCs at |Y | > 1, because\nthere are too few such GCs in this region.\nThe rotation-corrected velocity dispersions for the PNe at |Y | > 1 kpc are significantly\ndifferent from those for the metal-poor GCs. That is, the rotation-corrected velocity dispersion for the PNe at |Y | > 1 kpc are smaller than that for the metal-poor GCs at |Y | > 1\nkpc, and the former shows little variation depending on |Y | for |Y | > 1 kpc, while the latter\nincreases with |Y |. These differences show that the PNe are tracing well the bulge, while\nthe metal-poor GCs are tracing better the metal-poor halo, although their spatial coverages\nin the sky are similar. Therefore we conclude again that there do exist both an extended\nrotating bulge and a dynamically hot metal-poor halo in M31.\n\n4.3.\n\nFormation and Evolution of M31\n\nMain features related with the kinematics of the M31 GC system revealed in this study\ncan be summarized as follows. Most of the GCs show a strong rotation around the minor\naxis. The rotation velocity decreases with increasing distance from the major axis. It is\nstill as large as 60 \u223c 100 km s\u22121 even at |Y | > 5 kpc, indicating the bulge of M31 is\nlarge and rotation-dominated, which is consistent with the finding based on the PNe by\nHurley-Keller et al. (2004) and Merrett et al. (2006). The rotation velocity of the metalrich GCs is similar to that of the metal-poor GCs in the region close to the major disk. The\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\nspatial distribution of metal-rich GCs shows a stronger central concentration than that of\nthe metal-poor GCs. The rotation-corrected velocity dispersion of the metal-poor GCs in\nthe outer region of M31 is about twice larger than the rotation amplitude. There are several\nsubstructures in the spatial distribution of both metal-poor GCs and metal-rich GCs. There\nare about 50 friendless GCs all over the disk of M31, and most of them show retrograde\nmotion. Interestingly it appears that these GCs show a rotation around the major axis,\nwhile most of M31 GCs show a rotation around the minor axis.\nWhat do these results in addition to the known properties of M31 tell us about the\nformation and evolution of M31 in comparison with our Galaxy? The most distinguishable\nkinematic difference between the M31 GCs and the Galactic GCs is a difference in the bulge\nand halo kinematics. In our Galaxy metal-poor halo GCs are the most dominant population\namong the GCs, and metal-rich GCs in the bulge (or thick disk) are a minor population .\nThe bulge GCs show significant rotation (vrot = 193 \u00b1 29 km s\u22121 ), while the halo GCs are\npressure-supported (vrot = 43 \u00b1 29 km s\u22121 and \u03c3v = 123 km s\u22121 ) (Armandroff 1989; C\u00f4t\u00e9\n1999). In contrast, the disk and bulge GCs are the most dominant population in M31, and\nthe halo GCs may be a minor population compared with the Galactic halo GCs.\nThe current picture of the formation and evolution of the halo in our Galaxy involves\nbasically two classical scenarios: (a) The monolithic collapse model according to which\nthe stellar halo is formed by the rapid collapse of a monolithic protogalactic cloud in a\ndynamical time scale of about 0.1 Gyr(Eggen, Lynden-Bell, & Sandage 1962), and (b) the\naccretion/merging model according to which the stellar halo is formed via successive accretion\nand merging of protogalactic fragments (Searle & Zinn 1978; White & Rees 1978). The\nlatter is related with the current paradigm for explaining the formation of the cosmological\nlarge scale structure: a hierarchical merging scenario in the \u039bCDM universe. It appears\nthat both scenarios are involved in forming the halo of our Galaxy (Chiba & Beers 2000).\nWhile the inner part of our Galaxy can be explained mainly by the first, the outer part of\nour Galaxy is explained better by the latter.\nRecently, Renda et al. (2005a) suggested from a semi-analytic multizone chemical evolution model that the observed higher metallicity in the M31 halo compared with the Galactic\nhalo can be explained by two scenarios: (a) a higher star formation efficiency for the halo\nthat is expected from the accretion of smaller satellites, or (b) a larger reservoir of infalling\nhalo gas with a longer halo phase, producing the intermediate-age population in the halo.\nThese were also confirmed in the semi-cosmological spiral galaxy simulation by Renda et al.\n(2005b), indicating that the M31 halo may have a more protracted assembly history compared with the halo of our Galaxy. On the other hand, Font et al. (2006b) found from\nthe simulation of the stellar halo in our Galaxy based on the hierarchical scenario: (a) the\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\nstellar halo of our Galaxy formed inside out via accretion of satellites; (b) the inner halo at\nR < 20 kpc assembled rapidly, and most of its mass were in place more than 8-9 Gyr ago; (c)\nsatellites surviving today were accreted within the past few Gyr; and (d) a major fraction of\nthe present-day stellar halo was originally from a few massive satellites with M \u223c 108 \u2212 1010\nM\u2299 . They also pointed out that the much lower metallicity of the Galactic halo compared\nwith the M31 halo indicates that our Galaxy could have formed mainly through smaller\nsatellites. Noting that our Galaxy has a stellar mass and angular momentum that are 2 to 3\ntimes lower than M31, which is a typical spiral galaxy, Hammer et al. (2007) suggested that\nour Galaxy has an exceptionally quiet formation history involving no major merger during\nthe last 10-11 Gyr. However, it is noted that the term 'M31 halo' used in these studies corresponds to the extended bulge, not to the metal-poor halo in M31. Therefore these studies\nexplain the formation of the extended bulge in M31 and the halo in our Galaxy.\nM31 might have formed and evolved in a way similar to our Galaxy, with some differences. The existence of the rotating metal-rich central bulge, the radial gradient of the\nmetallicity and the extended smooth metal-poor halo in M31 can be explained by a rapid\ndissipative collapse of a proto-Galactic cloud, while the extended bulge and its several substructures including giant streams and friendless GCs (Ibata et al. (2005); Gilbert et al.\n(2007); Ibata et al. (2007) and this study), are evidence for accretion and merging of small\nscale fragments. Differences between M31 and our Galaxy are that the degree of merging\nwas larger, the scale of merging fragments was larger, and the duration of merging (or the\nfrequency of merging) was larger in M31 compared with our Galaxy. Remaining questions\nare: (a) Why does M31 have an extended metal-rich bulge in M31, which is not seen in our\nGalaxy?; (b) Why is the M31 extended bulge a strong rotator?; (c) Are there metal-poor\nGCs that do not show systematic rotation in the halo of M31?; (d) Why do the metal-poor\nGCs in M31 show some rotation while those in our Galaxy do not?; and (e) Is there indeed\na population of young disk GCs in M31 as posited by Morrison et al. (2004), which has no\ncounterpart in the Galaxy?\n\n5.\n\nSummary\n\nWe produced a master catalog of 504 GCs with measured velocity in M31 combining\nthe data for 211 GCs measured in our survey (Kim et al. 2007) and 354 GCs (including 61\ncommon GCs) available in the literature. Using the photometric and spectroscopic database\nof these GCs, we have investigated the kinematics of the GC system of M31. Our velocities\nare in good agreement with published values for objects in common, with a typical error of\n35.3 km/s. Primary results are summarized below:\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\n1. The mean value and dispersion of the radial velocities for the 211 GCs measured in\n\u22121\n\u22121\nthis study are vp = \u2212281+13\nand \u03c3p = 185+7\n\u221213 km s\n\u22126 km s , respectively. Using all\n504 GCs in the master catalog, we obtain the mean value and dispersion of the radial\n\u22121\n\u22121\nvelocities as vp = \u2212285+8\nand \u03c3p = 178+4\n\u22128 km s\n\u22124 km s , respectively.\n2. For all GCs, the rotation amplitude estimated by fitting the rotation curve is vrot =\n+39\n\u22121\n\u22121\n188+34\n\u221228 km s , while the one from the velocity histogram is vrot = 188\u221233 km s . The\nrotation amplitude decreases as the distance along the minor axis of M31 increases.\nHowever, the rotation amplitude is not zero for the outermost samples at |Y | \u2265 5 kpc,\nindicating an extended rotating bulge or a hot rotating halo.\n3. We have identified 50 friendless GCs among all 504 GCs. It appears that the friendless\nGCs rotate around the major axis of M31 unlike the rotation around the minor axis\nfor the disk population, which calls for more sophisticated investigation. A KS test\nyields that the difference between the friendless and normal GCs is significant for the\ndistribution of T1 magnitude and (C \u2212 T1 ) color.\n4. For the subsamples of the metal-poor GCs and metal-rich GCs, it is found that the\nmetal-rich GCs are more centrally concentrated than the metal-poor GCs, and that the\nrotation amplitudes for the metal-poor GCs and metal-rich GCs are similar. For the\nsubsamples of bright and faint GCs, it is found that the bright GCs are more centrally\nconcentrated than the faint GCs, and that the rotation for the faint GCs is stronger\nthan that for bright GCs.\n5. The rotation-corrected velocity dispersion for all GCs is estimated to be \u03c3p,r \u223c 130\nkm s\u22121 , and it increases from \u03c3p,r \u223c 120 km s\u22121 at |Y | < 1 kpc to \u03c3p,r \u223c 150 km\ns\u22121 at |Y | \u2265 5 kpc. These results are very similar to those for the metal-poor GCs.\nThis shows that there is a dynamically hot halo in M31 that is rotating but primarily\npressure-supported.\n6. We have identified 56 GCs and GC candidates with X-ray detection including 39 genuine GCs with measured velocities. Kinematic difference between the X-ray emitting\nand other GCs is not significant at this stage, but further studies are needed with an\nexpanded sample of X-ray emitting GCs. The photometric properties of the X-ray\nemitting GCs show that the GCs that are redder, more metal-rich, and brighter are\nmore likely to be detected as X-ray emitting GCs, as seen for GCs in early-type galaxies\n7. We derived the rotation curve of M31 using the metal-poor GCs at |Y | < 0.6 kpc\nfrom 8.9 to 46.4 arcmin. The rotation curve using the GCs in this study is consistent\nwith those using other tracers in the range 20 \u2212 45\u2032 except for that based on PNe of\nMerrett et al.
