In this paper we consider the critical\nbehavior of one of the simplest quasi-1D quantum spin\nsystems, the alternating Heisenberg chain with spin-1/2,\nas it approaches the uniform chain limit. This model is\nof special interest for the study of critical behavior, since\nmuch is known analytically about the gapless uniformchain limit through the Bethe Ansatz. This system is also\nimportant for studies of the magnetic spin-Peierls effect,\nand gives a reasonably accurate description of magnetic\ninteractions in many dimerized quasi-1D antiferromagnets.\nThe alternating Heisenberg antiferromagnet is a simple\ngeneralization of the uniform Heisenberg chain, with the\nnearest-neighbor exchange constant J replaced by two\nalternating values. The spin-1/2 system is defined by\nthe Hamiltonian\nH = J \u0303\n\nL/2 \u0010\n\u0011\nX\n~2i\u22121 * S\n~2i + (1 \u2212 \u03b4) S\n~2i * S\n~2i+1\n(1 + \u03b4) S\ni=1\n\n(1)\nand has a spin-singlet ground state with energy E0 and a\nnonzero singlet-triplet gap E1 \u2212 E0 for any alternation1\n0 < \u03b4 < 1.\nFor our study we introduce a finite-lattice, scaled\nground-state energy per spin,\n\u1ebd0 (L, \u03b4) = E0 (L, \u03b4) /LJ \u0303\nand a corresponding singlet-triplet gap\n\u0010\n\u0011\n \u0303\n\u2206(L,\n\u03b4) = E1 (L, \u03b4) \u2212 E0 (L, \u03b4) / J \u0303 .\n\n(2)\n\nby a factor of (1 + \u03b4) (albeit giving the same leading critical behavior). In addition, energies quoted with a single\nreal argument and a tilde (e.g. \u1ebd0 (\u03b4)) are bulk limits of\nthe scaled alternating chain, those with no tilde and a\nsingle integer argument (e.g. e0 (L)) are finite-L uniform\nchain results, and those with no arguments (e.g. e0 ) are\nbulk limits of the uniform chain.\nThe uniform spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnetic\nchain, which we recover at \u03b4 = 0, is the best understood 1D critical quantum spin system. It has a groundstate energy per spin of e0 = 1/4 \u2212 ln 2 and a band of\ngapless spin-triplet excitations with dispersion relation\n\u03c9(k)/J = \u03c0/2 | sin(k)|. The approach of noncritical models to this limiting case is not well established, and has\nbeen the subject of surprisingly few theoretical and numerical studies.\nEarly analytical studies of the effect of a small alternation \u03b4 on the uniform chain were reported by Cross and\nFisher2 and Black and Emery3 . Cross and Fisher used a\nJordan-Wigner transformation to map the original spin\nproblem onto a pseudo-fermion Hamiltonian, and approximated the latter by the exactly solvable LuttingerTomanaga model. This approach, which unfortunately\ninvolves uncontrolled approximations, yields critical exponents (defined by f (\u03b4) \u221d \u03b4 p ) of p = 4/3 for the groundstate energy and p = 2/3 for the singlet-triplet gap.\nBlack and Emery3 related the critical behavior of the\nalternating Heisenberg chain to the 4-state Potts model,\nand found logarithmic corrections to these power laws,\ne0 \u2212 \u1ebd0 (\u03b4) \u221d \u03b4 4/3 /| log \u03b4 |\n\n(4)\n\nfor the ground-state energy per spin, and\n(3)\n\nThe tilde indicates that these energies are scaled by J \u0303\n \u0303 which would divide our results\nrather than J \u2261 (1 + \u03b4)J,\n\n \u0303\n\u2206(\u03b4)\n\u221d \u03b4 2/3 /| log \u03b4 |1/2\n\n(5)\n\nfor the gap. Note that at this order the gap scales as\nthe square root of the ground-state energy defect. More\nrecent theoretical work by Affleck et al.4 has shown that\n\n\f2\nEqs. (4,5) are leading-order predictions of the renormalization group. The overall constants in these results and\nimplicit in the logarithms are non-universal, and have not\nyet been determined analytically for this model.\nSeveral previous numerical studies have investigated\nthe critical behavior of spin-1/2 alternating Heisenberg\nchains using bulk-limit extrapolations of exact diagonalization results on systems up to about L = 30 in extent\n(see Barnes et al.5 and Yu and Haas6 and references cited\ntherein). We shall see that important systematic errors\ncan arise from extrapolations using these relatively small\nsystems, for example in estimates of critical exponents.\nStudies of much larger spin-1/2 alternating Heisenberg\nchains have also been published using the DMRG algorithm, although there has been little systematic study\nof the critical behavior of the simple alternating chain\nmodel of Eq.(1) using DMRG. The single published reference on this topic is the work of Uhrig et al.9 , who\nestimate a gap critical exponent of 0.65. Their numerical\nenergies however deviate systematically from this power\nlaw at small alternation \u03b4 (see Fig.3 of Uhrig et al.9 ).\nIn related work, Chitra et al.8 used the DMRG method\nto study the effects of dimerization and frustration on\na generalized alternating chain model with next-nearestneighbor couplings, and Lou et al.10 studied the gap induced by a staggered magnetic field.\nIn this work we present a systematic DMRG study of\nthe critical behavior of the original alternating spin-1/2\nHeisenberg chain of Eq.(1), and compare the theoretical\npredictions Eqs.(4,5) to numerical results for the groundstate energy per spin and singlet-triplet gap of this model,\nusing systems up to L = 192 in extent.\n\nII.\n\nNUMERICAL METHOD\n\nFor our numerical study we employed the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm7 , which\nis a very effective method for studying critical behavior\nin quasi-1D quantum spin systems. Numerical determination of the critical behavior of the alternating chain,\nor any similar quantum spin system, is a daunting computational task. One must accurately determine energy\neigenvalues on quite large systems, since characteristic\nlengths typically diverge at critical points. An extrapolation through a series of fixed-L results is then required\non sufficiently large lattices to insure that one is in an\nasymptotic regime in which finite size effects can be accurately parametrized and eliminated. The computer memory requirements for diagonalizing these large systems are\nsuch that the detailed critical behavior of relatively few\nquantum spin systems has been explored numerically.\nThe DMRG algorithm has previously been applied\nto various interacting fermion systems, including onedimensional spin chains7 , lattice models11 , quasilinear\nmolecules12 and nuclei13,14 . The essential concept in\nDMRG is to \"grow\" a small, finite system into a larger\none by the iterative incorporation of new lattice sites. At\n\neach such iteration one retains only the m most relevant\nbasis states for spanning the targeted energy eigenstate.\n(These basis states are chosen according to a densitymatrix weight.) This selective sampling of Hilbert space\nyields accurate energy eigenvalues on systems which are\nwell beyond the limits of exact diagonalization. For details of the DMRG method we refer the reader to the\noriginal papers of White7 and to a series of lectures recently compiled by Peschel et al.11\nOur numerical implementation proceeds as follows. We\ndivide the spin chain into blocks A \u2212 a \u2212 B \u2212 b, where A\nand B denote the \"system\" and \"environment\" blocks,\nand a and b are elementary blocks to be added to A and\nB respectively. Blocks b and A are linked by periodic\nboundary conditions. We take spin dimers (two lattice\nsites of spin s = 1/2 each) as our elementary blocks, and\nuse the infinite algorithm to grow the spin chain, while\ntargeting the lowest-lying spin-0 or spin-1 state. In the\ncase of the spin-0 ground state of the alternating Heisenberg chain, we found that subsequent sweeps with the\nfinite algorithm do not lead to much improvement in the\nresults of the infinite algorithm. In contrast, for the spin1 state we found that sweeps with the finite algorithm\nwere important for convergence. Our DMRG implementation uses large, sparse matrices, so the sparse matrix\npackage Arpack15 was employed. The time consuming\nmatrix-vector multiplications and the Arnoldi/Lanczos\nalgorithm Arpack were parallelized.\nThe ground-state energy per spin \u1ebd0 (L, \u03b4) of a spin\nchain of length L and alternation \u03b4 is of special interest for our study of critical behavior (see Eq. (2)).\nDMRG yields approximate values \u1ebd0 (m; L, \u03b4) that typically converge exponentially fast from above as one increases the number m of states retained7,11 . We also\nobserved this behavior in the present study. We computed \u1ebd0 (m; L, \u03b4) numerically using DMRG on chains of\nlength L = 28, 48, 96, 144 and 192, and alternation\n\u03b4 = 2\u22123 , 2\u22124 , 2\u22125 , . . . , 2\u221210 . At each L and \u03b4 we increased\nm in steps of 10 starting at m = 30 until a fit of the form\n\u1ebd0 (m; L, \u03b4) = \u1ebd0 (L, \u03b4) + c1 exp (\u2212c2 m) gave sufficiently\nstable coefficients for our desired accuracy; this m extrapolation yielded our DMRG energy estimate \u1ebd0 (L, \u03b4).\nWe found that the maximum m needed for convergence to\na given accuracy increases with increasing chain length\nL and decreasing alternation \u03b4. For our extreme case\nL = 192 and \u03b4 = 2\u221210 , adequate convergence was not\nachieved until m = 150, and we retained the maximum\nof m = 170 states in this case. This resulted in a sparse\nmatrix problem of dimension \u2248 9 \u00d7 104 at each DMRG\niteration. Finally, we also confirmed recovery of exact\nL = 28 alternating chain results on allowing our DMRG\ncode to iterate to the full Hilbert space.\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS\n\nTable I gives our DMRG results for the ground-state\nenergy per spin for different alternations \u03b4 and chain\n\n\f3\n0.1\n\n1\n\n~(L,\u03b4)\n\u2206\n\ne0 - ~\ne 0(L,\u03b4)\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\nL=28\nL=48\nL=96\nL=144\nL=192\n1.45\n0.39 \u03b4\n4/3\n\u03b4\n\n0.0001\n\n1e-05\n0.0001\n\n0.001\n\n0.01\n\n\u03b4\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\nFIG. 1: Approach of \u1ebd0 (L, \u03b4) to the uniform-chain limit e0 =\n1/4 \u2212 ln(2) with decreasing alternation \u03b4 and increasing chain\nlength L.

We estimate that\nthe energy errors in Table I are a few units in the last\ndigit, based on the difference between the maximum-m\nDMRG result and the exponential m \u2192 \u221e extrapolation\nwhich we quote.\nFig. 1 shows the approach of \u1ebd0 (L, \u03b4) to the limit\ne0 = 1/4 \u2212 ln 2 as a function of alternation \u03b4 for spin\nchains of increasing length, L = 28, 48, 96, 144 and 192.\nThe asymptotic large-L envelope evident in this figure\n\u22128\nfor \u03b4 >\nclearly shows the bulk limit. The dashed\n\u223c 2\nline is a power-law fit c0 \u03b4 p to this envelope, which gives\nc0 = 0.39 and exponent p = 1.45. The renormalizationgroup prediction p = 4/3 from Eq. (4) (without the logarithmic factor) is also shown, displaced for clarity of\npresentation. Clearly this gives an inferior description of\nthe DMRG data over the range considered here.\n \u0303\nFig. 2 shows the singlet-triplet gap \u2206(L,\n\u03b4) as a function of alternation \u03b4 for spin chains of length L = 28, 48,\n96, 144 and 192. The envelope of these curves is the bulk\n\u22127\n \u0303\nlimit \u2206(\u03b4),\nwhich is evident for \u03b4 >\n\u223c 2 .

The renormalization-group prediction p = 2/3 from Eq.(5) is also shown, displaced for\npresentation. Evidently the renormalization-group exponent (without the logarithmic term) again gives a less\naccurate description of our DMRG data.

(9)) and our DMRG\nresults is evidently very good on the shorter chains. The\ndiscrepancy evident at L = 144 may be due to convergence problems encountered by the DMRG algorithm\nwhen applied to this asymptotically gapless system on\nlarge lattices. The DMRG results for the spin-1 energy\ndefect depart significantly from the leading-order term in\nEq.(10), but are consistent with this prediction when we\ninclude the O(L\u22122 (ln L)\u22121 ) correction.\nFinally we consider the dependence of the groundstate energy per spin \u1ebd0 (L, \u03b4) on the chain length L for\nfixed, nonzero alternation \u03b4. This is especially relevant\nto exact diagonalization studies, which extrapolate to the\n\nFIG. 4: Finite-size energy defects |es (L) \u2212 e0 | of the lowest spin-s levels on the uniform chain versus chain length L.\nThe data points are DMRG (+:spin-0, \u00d7:spin-1) and the lines\nare Bethe-Ansatz results (leading order (LO), solid; next-toleading order (NLO), dashed), from Eqs.(9,10).\n\nbulk limit from rather small systems of at most about\n30 spins. To test the accuracy of finite size extrapolations we used DMRG to compute the ground-state energy per spin and singlet-triplet gap on chains of length\nL = 28, 32, 36, 40, 44 and 48, and fitted the results to\nf (L) = a + b exp (\u2212L/c)/L and g(L) = a + b exp (\u2212L/c)\nrespectively. (These forms were used to extrapolate exact diagonalization results to the bulk limit by Barnes\net al.5 and Yu and Haas.6 ) Both functions yield reasonably good fits to our six data points in the range\nL = 28, . . . , 48. However, on comparing this extrapolation with our DMRG results on L = 96, 144 and 192\nlattices, we noted clear discrepancies as the alternation\n\u03b4 decreases. This is likely due to a rapid increase in the\ncharacteristic length (modeled by c in the exponents of\nf (L) and g(L)), which makes subleading terms in the\nasymptotic behavior more important. Our results thus\nsuggest caution in attempting to establish critical behavior from studies of relatively small systems.\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe have employed the DMRG algorithm to determine\nthe ground-state energy per spin and singlet-triplet gap\nof the alternating Heisenberg chain, and studied the critical behavior of this model in the limit of small alternation. We find that the approach of the bulk-limit groundstate energy per spin and singlet-triplet gap to the uniform chain limits are well described by power laws in the\n<\nalternation parameter \u03b4 over the range 0.008 <\n\u223c \u03b4 \u223c 0.1,\nand scale approximately as \u03b4 1.45 and \u03b4 0.73 respectively.\nThe renormalization group predictions of power laws\ntimes logarithmic corrections also appear consistent with\nour results, provided that a surprisingly large scale factor\n\n\f5\n\u03b40 is present in the logarithms.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe acknowledge useful communications with I.
