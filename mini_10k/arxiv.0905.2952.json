For example, several authors have used the\nmotion of a ruck to illustrate how dislocations can facilitate the relative motion of two crystalline planes of\natoms (see pg. 117 of [1]). In this situation the ruck is\nquasistatic. However, those working with carpets every\nday know that shaking one end leads to the propagation\nof rucks, which facilitate small-scale sliding [2]. This dynamic scenario is used to explain the observation of Schallamach waves [3]: waves of detachment that control the\nsliding of rubber surfaces [4, 5]. In much the same way\nthe slip pulses observed in some earthquakes [6, 7] are\noften thought to be akin to moving rucks in a rug [8].\nThough these analogies are frequently referred to in the\nliterature, we are not aware of any investigation of their\nquantitative validity nor even a study of the properties\nof rucks in rugs themselves. In this Letter, we consider\nthe statics and inertial dynamics of a ruck in a rug. Our\naim is to characterize the model system as a first step\ntowards understanding the validity of these analogies.\nRecently, a great deal of attention has been focussed\non understanding the statics and dynamics of thin elastic objects, of which a rug is a particular example. Static\nlocalized structures qualitatively similar to a ruck in a\nrug have been observed in the compression of thin films\nfloating on water [9] or deadhering from a polymer substrate [10]. Generally, studies of the dynamics of thin\nelastic objects have been focused on investigating the interaction of a flexible object with a fluid [11, 12]. The\npurely elastic propagation of localized disturbances along\nthin objects has received less attention, notable exceptions being investigations of a wave in a whip [13], the\ntravelling waves that form in suspension bridges [14] and\nthe rolling mode in vibrated thin plates [15].\n\nWe begin by considering the static problem of a twodimensional sheet of thickness h, density \u03c1 and bending\nstiffness B lying on a rigid, horizontal substrate. A certain end-end displacement \u2206l is then imposed symmetrically (see fig. 1). Since compression of the sheet itself\nis energetically expensive, we expect that the sheet will\nbuckle out of the plane. Opposing this is the weight per\nunit area of the sheet, \u03c1gh, which makes it energetically\nexpensive for the sheet to lose contact with the substrate\neverywhere along its length (in contrast with the conventional elastica [16]). Instead, contact is lost only over a\nlocalized region - a ruck is formed. We denote the shape\nof the ruck by [x(s), w(s)] in which s is the arc-length,\nthough it is more convenient to determine an intrinsic\nequation for the local inclination of the ruck, \u03b8(s). This\ncan be found by minimizing the value of the functional\nZ l/2 n\nh\nio\n2\n1\nB\u03b8\n+\n\u03c1gh\nw\n\u2212\n\u03a3\n\u2206l/l\n\u2212\ncos\n\u03b8\nds, (1)\nF\u2261\ns\n2\n0\n\nin which the first two terms are the bending and gravitational energies of deformation (per unit width), respectively, and the inextensibility constraint is enforced by a\nLagrange multiplier \u03a3 - the compressive force per unit\nwidth in the ruck. Here l is the total arc length contained\nin the ruck and we may consider only the interval [0, l/2]\nby symmetry. Integrating by parts and using ws = sin \u03b8,\nR l/2\nR l/2\n\u0001\nwe find that 0 w ds = 0 l/2 \u2212 s sin \u03b8 ds. We may\nthen use the Euler-Lagrange equations to find a differential equation for the \u03b8(s) that extremizes the functional\nin (1). We first note that a natural lengthscale\nlg \u2261\n\n\u0012\n\nB\n\u03c1gh\n\n\u00131/3\n\n(2)\n\narises. This elasto-gravitational length measures the typical sheet length required for the sheet to be deformed by\nits own weight.

Eqn. (3) is\ncommonly referred to as the heavy elastica equation [17]\n- it is the classical elastica equation [16] supplemented\nby a term representing the weight of the material. The\ndifferential equation (3) is of second order but contains an\nunknown eigenvalue \u03c3 so that three boundary conditions\nare required. These are\n\u03b8(0) = \u03b8S (0) = 0,\n\n\u03b8(L/2) = 0,\n\n(4)\n\nwhich express that the sheet is horizontal to the substrate and torque free where it first touches the substrate\n(at S = 0) as well as the symmetry of the sheet about\nS = L/2. The boundary value problem (3)-(4) may readily be solved numerically using, for example, MATLAB's\nbvp4c routine[18]. Some example profiles are shown in\nfig. 1 superimposed upon images of experimentally observed rucks in which a fixed end-end displacement \u2206L\nis imposed. We observe very good agreement between the\ntheoretically predicted and experimentally observed ruck\nshapes though for larger values of \u2206L there is a symmetry breaking instability [19]. Although the ruck shapes\nshown in fig. 1 are qualitatively similar to those observed\nin the classical elastica [16], a quantitative comparison\nshows that the heavy elastica shapes are flatter with a\nmore localized 'bump'. This is a result of the additional\nboundary condition \u03b8S (0) = 0 in the heavy elastica case.\nAnalytical progress may be made by linearizing (3) for\nsmall deformations, \u03b8 \u226a 1. The resulting problem may\nbe solved analytically giving\n2\n\n\u03c3 \u2248 4\u03b1 L\n\n\u22122\n\n,\n\n1/7\n\nL \u2248 (768/5)\n\n4/7\n\n\u03b1\n\n1/7\n\n\u2206L\n\n,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03b1 \u2248 4.49341 is the smallest positive solution of\ntan x = x.

The numerically computed boundary between sticking and slipping (solid curve) compares well with the asymptotic result (6) (dashed curve) for \u2206L \u226a 1. The unit of length\nis the elasto-gravitational length lg , defined in (2).\n\nthe laws \u03c3 \u2248 3.441\u2206L\u22122/7 , L \u2248 4.844\u2206L1/7 and \u03b4 \u2248\n1.326\u2206L4/7 where \u03b4 \u2261 d/lg is the dimensionless ruck\nheight. These laws were previously presented as functions\nof \u03c3 [20]. Recently, energy arguments for the scalings\nalone were also given [21]. The dependence of L on \u2206L is\ndistinct from the classical elastica where L is the system\nsize and hence independent of \u2206L.\nWe next consider the question will a ruck remain once\nthe compressing force that formed it is removed? For a\nstationary ruck to stick, the compressive force within the\nruck, \u03c3, must be smaller than the maximum static frictional force that can be exerted on the heavy sheet by\nthe substrate. With a coefficient\nof static friction\n\u03bc, we\n\u0003\n\u0002\ntherefore require that \u03c3 \u2264 \u03bc (L0 \u2212L)/2+N0 in which L0\nis the total (non-dimensional) length of the sheet and N0\nis the normal reaction on the sheet at the point of contact\nbetween the sheet and substrate (i.e. at S = 0). Considering (3) we see that N0 = L/2, i.e. the normal force at\ncontact exactly balances the weight of the material contained in the half of the ruck for which S < L/2. We\ntherefore find that a ruck sticks provided that \u03c3 \u2264 \u03bcL0 .\nThis result is exact though, in general, the dependence\nof \u03c3 on \u2206L must be determined numerically. However,\nfor small deformations, (5) may be used to relate \u03c3 and\n\u2206L and show that a ruck sticks only if\n\u221a\n\u0001\u22127/2\n20 2\u03b13\n\u2206L \u2265\n,\n(6)\n\u03bcL0\n3\ni.e. a ruck must be sufficiently large to stick. Qualitatively speaking, this result remains valid even for large\ndeformations, since the compressive force \u03c3 is always a\ndecreasing function of the imposed end-end compression,\n\u2206L. Fig. 2 shows a regime diagram of the regions of\n\n\f3\n\nW\n\nlg Xpeak (m)\n\n1.4\n(\u03bcL0 , \u2206L) parameter space for which a ruck sticks or\nslips. Fig. 2 also shows the results of experiments in\n1.2\nwhich the critical value of \u2206L at which rucks first stick\n1\nwas determined for different sheet lengths using a variety of sheet materials and substrates. In each case, the\n0.8\nvalue of lg was measured experimentally using the loop\np\n0.6\nc glg\ntest [22] and \u03bc was measured from the angle of friction.\nWe now move on to discuss the dynamic motion of\n0.4\na ruck. The experiments described here involved my0.2\nlar sheets (Goodfellow, Cambridge) of thicknesses h =\n125, 250, 350 and 500 \u03bcm and length 2 m. These sheets\n0\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nwere laid horizontally on various different substrates (to\n1/2\n(lg /g) T (s)\ninvestigate the role of substrate friction). The far end\nof the sheet is left free to move[23] and the near end at1.5\ntached to a vertical track. We generate a moving ruck\nby lifting the near end of the sheet vertically along the\ntrack (allowing the free end to slide in) and then moving\n1\nthe near end rapidly downwards. This leads to the formation of a localized ruck, which typically propagates at\nspeeds \u223c 1 m/s away from the near end. The size of the\n0.5\nruck may be controlled by lifting the near end to different\nPSfrag replacements\ninitial heights. However, to render air resistance negligible we ensure that the mass of air contained beneath the\nruck is less than the mass of the ruck itself.

Experimental points are shown for different sheet thicknesses and substrates (hence different values\nof the friction coefficient \u03bc) as shown in the legend. The values measured of the friction coefficients are \u03bc = 0.13 (copper),\n\u03bc = 0.41 (carpet) and \u03bc = 0.16 (wood). The dependence of\n\u03c3 + c2 on \u03b4 determined from the numerical solution of (9) is\nplotted as the solid curve while the asymptotic result (10) is\nplotted as the dashed line.

This point is illustrated in fig. 3b\nwhere we see that while the ruck is propagating with a\nconstant speed, its shape is indistinguishable from that\nof a static ruck with the same value of \u2206L.\nIt is a simple matter to solve numerically the eigenproblem (9) with boundary conditions analogous to (4).\nThe linearized problem may be solved analytically giving\nthe effective tension in terms of the ruck height \u03b4 \u2261 d/lg\n\u03c3 + c2 \u2248 3.962\u03b4 \u22121/2.\n\n(10)\n\nThe presence of the combination \u03c3 + c2 in (9) and\n(10) indicates that the ruck speed c is not uniquely determined by the solution of the eigenproblem (9) with\nboundary conditions (4). This is demonstrated by the\ninset\np of fig. 4, which shows raw results for the speed,\nc glg , as a function of ruck height, d. However, we note\nthat the slipping away of the ruck enables us to estimate\nthe value of \u03c3 - at the commencement of slipping, \u03c3\nmust exactly balance the maximum static friction force\nthat can be generated by the material remaining between\nthe ruck and the free end. Fig. 4 shows non-dimensional\nresults for \u03c3+c2 as a function of ruck height \u03b4 determined\nusing this experimental procedure.

These show that\n\nIn this Letter we have considered the properties of\nstatic rug rucks and shown that friction allows sufficiently\nlarge rucks to remain once the initial compression is removed. We have also considered the inertial dynamics\nof rucks, complementing a recent study of the creeping\nmotion of a ruck on an inclined plane [21]. A result of particular interest is that large rucks generally move more\nslowly than smaller ones. If colliding rucks aggregate\nthis fact would drive a population of travelling rucks to\nform one large, slow moving ruck. Future work will focus on determining whether this is qualitatively the same\nin populations of slip pulses in geophysical settings and\ncould in turn lead to alternative mechanical rationalizations [25] of the statistics of earthquakes.\nWe thank L.
