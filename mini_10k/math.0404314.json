The purpose of this paper is to show that\nthis approach can also be used to describe the Galois action on \u03c01 (X, x\u0304) \u2297 Ql , with X\nnow defined over a number field K.\nLet G = Gal(K\u0304/K), and p a prime of K\u0304. The main idea in Section 1 is to define, for\neach p, a Gp-invariant decomposition on L(\u03c01 (X, x\u0304), Ql ), the Lie algebra underlying the\n\u2217\n\nThe author was supported during this research by Trinity College, Cambridge and by the Isle of\nMan Department of Education.\n\n1\n\n\fpro-l-unipotent fundamental group. This can be done for every prime p \u2224 l at which X is\nof potentially good reduction. Weight restrictions on cohomology then give restrictions\non the possible weight decompositions on this Lie algebra. In particular, when X is\nproper, the Gp-action on \u03c01 (X, x\u0304) \u2297 Ql is completely determined by the Gp-action on\ncohomology. The case when p | l is more difficult. A suitable weight decomposition can\n\u03c6\n. This requires that L(\u03c01 (XK\u0304 , x\u0304), Ql )\noften be defined, but only after tensoring with Bcris\nbe a potentially crystalline Galois representation, and the remainder of the paper is\nconcerned with proving that this is the case.\nIn Section 2, the pro-unipotent crystalline fundamental group is defined, together\nwith a cosimplicial algebra which can be thought of as the crystalline homotopy type.\nThe cohomology groups of the crystalline homotopy type are the crystalline cohomology\ngroups of the scheme, and the pro-unipotent fundamental group can be recovered from\nthe algebra.\nThe purpose of Section 3 is to establish a comparison theorem between the crystalline\nhomotopy type and the pro-p \u00e9tale homotopy type defined in [Pri04]. This just amounts\nto showing that the chain of isomorphisms of cohomology groups in [Fal89] can be\nreplaced by a chain of quasi-isomorphisms of cosimplicial algebras. As a consequence\nof this comparison, we can compare fundamental groups (Corollary 3.3) when X is of\ngood reduction:\nL(\u03c01cris (Xk , xs ), K0 ) \u2297K0 B \u223c\n= L(\u03c01\u00e9t (XK\u0304 , x\u0304\u03b7 ), Qp ) \u2297Qp B.\nso that L(\u03c01\u00e9t (XK\u0304 , x\u0304\u03b7 ), Qp ) is indeed a crystalline Galois representation.\n\n1\n\nThe pro-l-unipotent fundamental group\n\nAs in [Pri04] Section 1, define NQl to be the category of finite-dimensional nilpod\ntent Lie algebras over Ql , and N\nQl to be the category of finitely generated (i.e.\ndim L/[L, L] < \u221e) pro-nilpotent Lie algebras over Ql .\nRecall (ibid. Section 2.2) that, for a pro-finite group \u0393, we define the Ql Malcev Lie\nd\nalgebra L(\u0393, Ql ) \u2208 N\nQl to pro-represent the functor on NQl given by\ng 7\u2192 Homcts (\u0393, exp(g)).\n\nDefine the pro-Ql -unipotent completion of \u0393 by\n\u0393 \u2297\u1e90 Ql := exp(L(\u0393, Ql )).\nGiven a ground field k, a connected scheme X0 /k and a point x \u2208 X0 , let\nX = X0 \u2297k k\u0304, and let x\u0304 \u2208 X be the point above x. We wish to study the action of\nGal(k\u0304/k) on the group\n\u03c01 (X, x\u0304) \u2297 Ql ,\nfor l different from the characteristic of k. From ibid. Lemma 2.25, this fundamental\ngroup has tangent space H1 (X, Ql ) and obstruction space H2 (X, Ql ).\n\n2\n\n\fDefinition 1.1. Given a smooth proper variety X\u0304 over k\u0304, with D a divisor locally of\nnormal crossings, let X = X\u0304 \u2212 D, and fix a geometric point x\u0304 \u2192 X. Define the ideal\nK as the kernel of the map\nL(\u03c01 (X, x\u0304), Ql ) \u2192 L(\u03c01 (X\u0304, x\u0304), Ql ).\nLemma 1.2. The definition of K is independent of the choice X\u0304 of compactification of\nX.\nProof. Consider the Lie algebra L(\u03c01 (X, x\u0304), Ql )/K.\nThis has tangent space\n1\n1\n2\nIm (H (X\u0304, Ql ) \u2192 H (X, Ql )), and obstruction space H (X, Ql ). Now, as in [Del71]\n3.2.4.1, and similarly to [Mil80] Corollary VI 5.3, we have the Gysin exact sequence\nH1 (X\u0304, Ql ) \u2192 H1 (X, Ql )) \u2192 H0 (D\u0303, Ql (\u22121)),\nwhere D\u0303 is the normalisation of D. If we adopt the same conventions for weights as in\n[Del75] (i.e. Frobenius in finite characteristic, and Hodge theory in characteristic zero)\nthen we see that\nIm (H1 (X\u0304, Ql ) \u2192 H1 (X, Ql )) = W1 H1 (X, Ql ),\nthe component of weight one. Thus for any two choices of X\u0304, our Lie algebra has the\nsame tangent and obstruction spaces.\nAs in [Del71] 3.2.11 C, we my compare any two compactifications by taking morphisms to a third, and since these morphisms induce isomorphisms of the tangent and\nobstruction spaces of the corresponding Lie algebras, they must induce isomorphism on\nthe Lie algebras themselves.\nDefinition 1.3. In the situation above, define the increasing weight filtration on\nL := L(\u03c01 (X, x\u0304), Ql ) to be the filtration generated by the following conditions:\nW\u22121 L = L,\n\nK \u2282 W\u22122 L,\n\n[Wm L, Wn L] \u2282 Wm+n L.\n\nMost of this paper is concerned with finding splittings of this weight filtration, i.e.\nweight decompositions. Note that if X is smooth and proper then the weight filtration\nis just the commutator filtration W\u2212n = \u0393n .\nRemark 1.4. There are times when X0 /k has no closed points, yet we may still define\nan outer action of Gal(k\u0304/k) on \u03c01 (X). We may regard \u03c01 (X) \u2297 Ql as being the hull of\nthe deformation functor PB(X) defined in [Pri04] Section 2.2. Alternatively, we may\nuse tangential basepoints, as dealt with in ibid. Remark 2.30.\n\n1.1\n\nFinite characteristic\n\nLet k = Fq be a finite field, with X variety over k\u0304, either proper or smooth. There is a\nnatural Frobenius action F on \u03c01 (X, x\u0304), and hence on\nL := L(\u03c01 (X, x\u0304), Ql ).\nLet Ln = L/(\u0393n+1 L), recalling that \u0393n is the nth commutator (i.e. \u03931 L = L, and\n\u0393n+1 L = [L, \u0393n L]). Since Ln is finite dimensional, we may consider Jordan decompositions (over Q\u0304l ) given by F .\n3\n\n\fLemma 1.5. On Ln , all of the eigenvalues of F are algebraic numbers, all of whose\nconjugates have norm q w/2 , for some negative integer w (dependent on \u03b1).\nProof. We prove this by induction on n. For n = 1, L1 \u223c\n= H1 (X, Ql )\u2228 , so this statement\nis just [Del80] Corollaries (3.3.4)\u2013(3.3.6).\nNow, note that if v is in the generalised \u03bb-eigenspace for F , and w in the generalised\n\u03bc-eigenspace, then [v, w] is in the generalised \u03bb\u03bc-eigenspace, since\n(F \u2212 \u03bb\u03bc)[v, w] = [(F \u2212 \u03bb)v, F w] + [\u03bbv, (F \u2212 \u03bc)w],\nso (F \u2212 \u03bb\u03bc)N [v, w] = 0 for N \u226b 0.\nHence the statement of the Lemma holds for \u0393n (L)/\u0393n+1 (L) (by multiplicativity),\nsince it holds for L1 .\nAssume the statement holds for Ln\u22121 . Consider the exact sequence\n0 \u2192 \u0393n (L)/\u0393n+1 (L) \u2192 Ln \u2192 Ln\u22121 \u2192 0.\nSince the statement holds for the terms on either side, it holds for Ln .\nL\nCorollary 1.6. There is a weight decomposition Ln = i Wi (Ln ) on the inverse system\nLn .\nProof. We just decompose by the weights i of the eigenvalues of norm q i/2 .\nTheorem 1.7. If X is smooth, satisfying the conditions of Definition 1.3, then this\nweight decomposition is a splitting of the weight filtration W .\nProof. It suffices to show that GrW\ni L is pure of weight i (in the sense of Frobenius\neigenvalues). Indeed, it is enough for Grr\u0393 GrW\ni L to be pure of weight i. But now observe\nr\nW\nthat Gr\u0393 Gri L is spanned by commutators consisting of i \u2212 r elements of K/K \u2229 \u03932\nand 2r \u2212 i elements of L/(\u03932 + K).\nNow, L/(\u03932 + K) is dual to W1 H1 (X, Ql ), which is pure of weight 1, by Lemma\n1.2, so L/(\u03932 + K) is pure of weight \u22121. Meanwhile, K/K \u2229 \u03932 is dual to\nH1 (X, Ql )/W1 H1 (X, Ql ), which is pure of weight 2, so K/K \u2229 \u03932 is pure of weight\n\u22122.\nTherefore Grr\u0393 GrW\ni L is pure of weight i, as required.\nCorollary 1.8. For X as above, there is a Frobenius equivariant isomorphism of inverse\nsystems Ln (\u03c01 (X, x\u0304), Ql ) \u223c\n= GrW Ln (\u03c01 (X, x\u0304), Ql ).\nTheorem 1.9.\n1. If H1 (X, Ql ) is pure of weight a > 0, then there is a Frobenius\nequivariant map\nL(H1 (X, Ql )\u2228 ) \u0589 L(\u03c01 (X, x\u0304), Ql ),\ninducing the identity on tangent spaces H1 (X, Ql ).\n2.

Since H1 (X, Ql ) is pure of weight a, it follows that \u0393n L = W\u2212na L. It then\nfollows that the composition\nW\u2212a \u0592\u2192 L \u0589 L/\u03932 (L) \u223c\n= H1 (X, Ql )\u2228\nis a Frobenius equivariant isomorphism, so we may take its inverse to give a map\nH1 (X, Ql )\u2228 \u2192 L, extending to give\nL(H1 (X, Ql )\u2228 ) \u0589 L(\u03c01 (X, x\u0304), Ql ).\n2. This is essentially the same as the proof of [Pri04] Theorem 3.2. Let J be the\nkernel of the map above, and write H1 for H1 (X, Ql )\u2228 . It follows that (J/[H1 , J])\u2228\nis a universal obstruction space for L, which gives us a unique morphism\n(J/[H1 , J])\u2228 \u0592\u2192 H2 (X, Ql )\nof obstruction theories. These obstruction theories are both Frobenius equivariant,\nso this map must be. Now note that J \u2282 \u03932 L(H1 ), so J is of weights \u2264 \u22122a, so\n(J/[H1 , J])\u2228 is of weights \u2265 2a. By hypothesis, H2 (X, Ql ) is of weights \u2264 2a, so\nthe inclusion above implies that (J/[H1 , J])\u2228 must be pure of weight 2a.\nNow, since [H1 , J] is of weights \u2264 3a, the composition\nW\u22122a \u2229 J \u0592\u2192 J \u0589 J/[H1 , J]\nmust be an isomorphism, so W\u22122a \u2229 J generates the ideal J, and since H1 (X, Ql )\nis pure of weight a,\n^2\nW\u22122a =\nH1 (X, Ql )\u2228 .\n\nThe inclusion of obstruction spaces therefore corresponds to a Frobenius equivariant map\n^2\nH2 (X, Ql )\u2228 \u0589 W\u22122a \u2229 J =\nH1 (X, Ql )\u2228 \u2229 J,\n\nwhich, by comparing primary obstruction maps, must be dual to the cup product.\nHence\n\u02c7 H2 (X, Ql )\u2228 ),\nJ = (\u222a\nso\n\n\u02c7 H2 (X, Ql )\u2228 )) \u223c\nL(H1 (X, Ql )\u2228 )/(\u222a\n= L(\u03c01 (X, x\u0304), Ql ).\n\nRemarks 1.10.\n1. If X is smooth and proper, then H1 (X, Ql ) will be pure of weight\n1, and H2 (X, Ql ) pure of weight 2, so both conditions will be satisfied.\n2. If X = X\u0304 \u2212D, for X\u0304 smooth, proper and simply connected, and D a divisor locally\nof normal crossings, then H1 (X, Ql ) will be pure of weight 2. Since H2 (X, Ql ) is\nautomatically of weights \u2264 4, both conditions of the theorem are satisfied.\n3. If X = X\u0304 \u2212 D, with the Gysin map H0 (D\u0303, Ql (\u22121)) \u2192 H2 (X, Ql ) injective, then\nH1 (X, Ql ) will be pure of weight 1, so the first condition is satisfied.\n5\n\n\f1.2\n\nGood reduction, l 6= p\n\nIn characteristic zero, the easiest case to deal with is when working over a local field.\nLet V be a complete discrete valuation ring, with fraction field K, and finite residue\nfield k of characteristic p.

By passing to a global field, and then localising at a different prime,\nwe may describe the structure, but not the Galois action. If we could describe the\nGalois action on \u03c01 (XK\u0304 , x\u0304\u03b7 ) \u2297 Qp , then we would also be able to describe the action on\nits tangent space, H1 (XK\u0304 , Qp ), but this requires p-adic Hodge theory.\nLet K be as before, and K \u2032 /K a finite Galois extension, with residue field k\u2032 = Fq ,\nof characteristic p.

We wish to define, for any connected scheme X/k, and any point\nx \u2208 X(k), a pro-nilpotent crystalline fundamental group\n\u03c01cris (X, x) \u2297 K.\n\n11\n\n\fDefinition 2.1. Given a smooth group scheme H/W , let Hn = H \u2297W Wn . Define a\nconstructible H-torsor D on X to be an inverse system of principal H-torsors Dn on the\ncrystalline sites X/Wn , such that\nDn = i\u22121\nn Dn+1 ,\nfor in : (X/Wn )cris \u2192 (X/Wn+1 )cris , so we may regard D as\nD = lim Dn .\n\u2190\u2212\nThe principal H-torsor is then given by the sheaf\n(U \u0592\u2192 T ) 7\u2192 H(T ),\nfor U \u2282 X, and U \u2192 T a DP-thickening.\nDefinition 2.2. Given a smooth group scheme G/K, define a constructible G-torsor B\nto be\nB = D \u2297W K,\nfor some group scheme H/W with G = H \u2297W K, and some constructible H-torsor D.\nTo make this explicit, a constructible G-torsor is a pair (H, D), with H/W as above,\nand if we have a map H1 \u2192 H2 of smooth group schemes over W , becoming the identity\nmap on G when tensored with K, then we regard the H2 -torsor\nT 7\u2192 D1 (T ) \u00d7H1 (T ) H2 (T )\nas being equivalent to the H1 -torsor (H1 , D1 ).\nWe are now in a position to define a functor on NK which \u03c01cris (X, x) \u2297 K should\npro-represent. Given any g \u2208 NK , observe that exp(g) is represented by a smooth affine\ngroup scheme over K. Explicitly, we may construct this group scheme by considering\nthe polynomial algebra over K generated by g\u2228 , with comultiplication coming from the\nCampbell-Baker-Hausdorff formula, which will converge, since g is nilpotent.\nDefinition 2.3. Define the functor\nT(X) : NK \u2192 Grpd\nto associate to g the groupoid of constructible exp(g)-torsors on X.\nDefine the groupoid\nTx (X)(g)\nto be the fibre of\nT(X)(g) \u2192 T(x)(g)\nover (exp(g \u2297 OX/W ), id).\nThe crucial difference between the groupoids Tx (X)(g) and T(X)(g) is that only\nthose morphisms which give the identity on Bx are permitted in the former.\n\n12\n\n\fDefinition 2.4. Define\nL(\u03c01cris (X, x), K)\nto pro-represent the functor Tx (X). Note that this functor is clearly homogeneous, and\nhas trivial automorphisms, so will be pro-representable provided the relevant tangent\nspace (which will be H1cris (X/W ) \u2297 K) is finite dimensional. Define\n\u03c01cris (X, x) \u2297 K := exp(L(\u03c01cris (X, x), K)).\nRemark 2.5. Since exponentiation gives an equivalence between NK and the category of\nunipotent algebraic K-groups, Tannakian duality implies that linear representations of\n\u03c01cris (X, x)\u2297 K correspond to nilpotent isocrystals on X. This means that our definition\nof \u03c01cris agrees with [Shi00] Definition 4.1.5.\nDefinition 2.6. Let\nFHS(X) : NQl \u2192 Cat\nassociate to g the category of faithful constructible homogeneous exp(g)-sheaves on X.\nObserve that T(X) is the fibre of FHS(X) over the trivial exp(0)-sheaf 1 (the constant\nsheaf of singleton sets).\nIn order to find a suitable SDC to govern this problem, we will follow [BO78] 5.28\nand 5.26.

The adjunction v \u22121 \u22a3 v\u2217 is also comonadic, since the\nmaps X \u2032 \u2192 X are coverings. Note that w = vj = jv, and that the maps v \u22121 , v\u2217 , j \u22121 , j\u2217\nall commute with each other (whenever the composition can be defined), since v \u22121 and\nj \u22121 always commute with everything, and direct images commute with each other.\nNext, observe that the maps\n\u2032\nFHS(Xcris\n|X \u2032 DP ) o\n\n\u03c6\u2217\n\u03c6\u2217\n\n/\n\n\u2032\nFHS(XZar\n)\n\ngive an equivalence of categories.

However, it will be whenever the U\u03b1\nare such that the U\u03b1o \u2297 K\u0304 are K(\u03c0, 1) spaces.\nRecall (for instance, from [Fal88] Ch.II \u00a72) the definition of a K(\u03c0, 1) space. Suppose\nZ is a smooth irreducible scheme over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero,\nwith fundamental group \u03c0.
