Most\ndiscussions of this geometry take place in the \"thin-wall\" limit, where the geometries\ninside and outside of the bubble are pieces of de Sitter space, Minkowski space, or\nAnti de Sitter space, sewn together nonanalytically at the domain wall. This picture\nis sufficient for many qualitative questions, but is troublesome when applied to calculations of correlation functions in the CDL background [7, 8]. This often involves\nvarious analytic continuations from Euclidean to Lorentzian signature, and also from\none part to another of the geometry, and pathologies can appear when the geometry\nis not analytic. Our goal in this paper is to give some reasonably simple analytic expressions for \"thick-wall\" CDL bubbles which mediate various types of decays. There\nis a conservation of trouble here, however, in that we will not be able to give closed\nform expressions for the scalar potentials which give rise to these geometries. Rather\nwe will work out a set of general constraints that the metric needs to obey in order for\nit to come from some scalar field theory with a potential, and then give examples of\ngeometries which satisfy all the constraints. Since it is the potential that usually comes\nout of \"top-down\" constructions this may not seem eminently useful, but we consider\nour approach to be more appropriate for \"bottom-up\" investigations of bulk physics\nin the CDL background. Similar analyses have been applied to other less-restricted\ncases such as thick domain walls [9\u201311] and FRW cosmologies [12], both of which are\ncontained in our analytic CDL geometries.\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\f2\n\nGeneral Properties of the Coleman-De Luccia Geometry\n\n2.1\n\nEuclidean Preliminaries\n\nThe Euclidean CDL geometry is a solution of the equations of motion for the scalar/gravity\nsystem with Euclidean action\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\nZ\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\n1\nd \u221a\nd \u221a\n(2.1)\nS=\u2212\nd x gR + d x g g \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202\u03bd \u03c6 + V (\u03c6) .\n16\u03c0G\n2\nThe solution has SO(d) symmetry, so we can write the metric as\n\u0001\nds2 = d\u03be 2 + a(\u03be)2 d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03a92d\u22122 .\n\n(2.2)\n\nThe equations of motion for solutions with this symmetry are\na0\n\u03c600 + (d \u2212 1) \u03c60 \u2212 V 0 (\u03c6) = 0\na\n\u0012 0 \u00132\n\u0013\n\u0012\na\n16\u03c0G\n1\n1 02\n\u03c6 \u2212 V (\u03c6) .\n= 2+\na\na\n(d \u2212 1)(d \u2212 2) 2\n\n(2.3)\n\nIf V has a local extremum at \u03c6 = \u03c6min then there is a simple solution. When\nV (\u03c6min ) = 0 we have flat space:\na(\u03be) = \u03be.\n(2.4)\nWhen V (\u03c6min ) = \u03c1min > 0, we have the sphere:\na(\u03be) = `ds sin(\u03be/`ds )\n16\u03c0G\u03c1min\n.\n`\u22122\nds =\n(d \u2212 2)(d \u2212 1)\n\n(2.5)\n\nWhen V (\u03c6min ) = \u03c1min < 0, we have hyperbolic space:\na(\u03be) = `ads sinh(\u03be/`ads )\n16\u03c0G\u03c1min\n.\n`\u22122\nads = \u2212\n(d \u2212 2)(d \u2212 1)\n\n(2.6)\n\nMore interesting solutions will interpolate smoothly between different minima\nof the potential; these have the interpretation of causing bubble nucleation.1 The\ngeometries describing the decay of Minkowski space and AdS are noncompact and can\nbe chosen to have \u03be \u2208 [0, \u221e), while the geometry describing the decay of dS space\nis compact and can be chosen to have \u03be \u2208 [0, \u03bec ]. In all cases for the solution to be\nsmooth at \u03be = 0 we need\n\u03c6(\u03be) = \u03c60 + O(\u03be 2 )\na(\u03be) = \u03be + O(\u03be 3 ).\n1\n\n(2.7)\n\nThe Euclidean solution does not actually quite reach the minimum; the more precise boundary\nconditions are stated momentarily. Also for vacua which have V < 0 it is possible for a maximum to\nbe stable or metastable; we include this case below in our definition of a CDL geometry.\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fFor the noncompact cases, as \u03be \u2192 \u221e we want \u03c6 to approach its value in the false\nvacuum and a to approach (2.4) or (2.6). When the false vacuum is dS then as \u03be \u2192 \u03bec\nsmoothness requires\n\u03c6(\u03be) = \u03c6c + O((\u03bec \u2212 \u03be)2 )\na(\u03be) = (\u03bec \u2212 \u03be) + O((\u03bec \u2212 \u03be)3 ).\n2.2\n\n(2.8)\n\nLorentzian Continuation\n\nTo find the Lorentzian geometry describing the aftermath of bubble nucleation we\nanalytically continue the Euclidean solution of the previous subsection. To get inside\nthe bubble we define\n\u03be = it\n\u03b8 = i\u03c1\n\u00e21 (t) = \u2212ia(it),\n\n(2.9)\n\nwhich gives an open FRW cosmology\n\u0001\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + \u00e21 (t)2 d\u03c12 + sinh2 \u03c1d\u03a92d\u22122 .\n\n(2.10)\n\nTo get the Lorentzian geometry outside of the bubble we continue\n\u03b8=\n\n\u03c0\n+ i\u03c9,\n2\n\nwhich gives a \"warped de Sitter\" geometry\n\u0002\n\u0003\nds2 = d\u03be 2 + a(\u03be)2 \u2212d\u03c9 2 + cosh2 \u03c9d\u03a92d\u22122 .\n\n(2.11)\n\n(2.12)\n\nWhen the false vacuum is dS there is an additional region outside of the bubble which\nis up near the future boundary of the false vacuum, which we reach by\n\u03be = \u03bec + it\n\u03b8 = i\u03c1\n\u00e22 (t) = ia(\u03bec + it).\n\n(2.13)\n\nBoth \u00e21 and \u00e22 obey the Lorentzian FRW equations of motion\n\u00e2 \u0307\n\u03c6\u0308 + (d \u2212 1) \u03c6\u0307 + V 0 (\u03c6) = 0\n\u00e2\n!2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u00e2 \u0307\n1\n16\u03c0G\n1 2\n= 2+\n\u03c6\u0307 + V (\u03c6) .\n\u00e2\n\u00e2\n(d \u2212 1)(d \u2212 2) 2\n\n(2.14)\n\nThe metric and scalar produced by these continuations are guaranteed to be real\nbecause they obey equations of motion and boundary conditions that are real. In\nparticular the simple Euclidean solutions with constant \u03c6 become various patches of\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fMinkowski, de Sitter, or Anti de Sitter space. The late time behaviour inside of the\nbubble depends on the nature of the \"true\" minimum. If the minimum is infinitely far\naway in field space then there are many possibilities, but if the minimum is at some\nfinite \u03c6 there are only three. These are Minkowski space2\n\u00e21 (t) \u2192 t,\n\n(2.15)\n\n\u00e21 (t) \u223c et/`1 ,\n\n(2.16)\n\n\u00e21 (t) \u223c sin(t/`1 ).\n\n(2.17)\n\nde Sitter\nand Anti de Sitter3\nIf the false vacuum has positive energy and is at finite field value then we also expect\n\u00e22 (t) \u223c et/`2 .\n\n(2.18)\n\nThe full analytic continuation is illustrated in Figure 1.\n\n\u03be\na1(t)\n\na2(t)\na(\u03be)\n\n\u03bec\nFigure 1. On the left we have the three regions of interest in the \u03be plane for the Lorentzian\ncontinuation of a compact CDL geometry. The red line gives \u00e21 (t), the blue line gives a(\u03be),\nand the green line gives \u00e22 (t). On the right we show the regions of the CDL Penrose diagram\nthat are described by these different continuations. If the geometry is noncompact then the\nblue line extends to infinity and the \u00e22 region doesn't exist.\n\n2.3\n\nConstraints and a Definition\n\nFor a given potential the boundary conditions are sufficient to determine a unique\nsolution of the equations of motion (2.3). What we will do in this section is to identify\nthe constraints that a real and positive function a(\u03be) must obey in addition to the\nboundary conditions to ensure that a potential exists which has this a(\u03be) (and some\n\u03c6(\u03be)) as a solution, and also that its analytic continuation describes a Lorentzian\nbubble geometry of true vacuum surrounded by false vacuum.\n2\n\nWe use \"\u2192\" here instead of \"\u223c\" to indicate a(t) = t(1 + o(t0 )), i.e. unlike the dS and AdS cases\nthe prefactor must go to one.\n3\nIn this case late time does not make so much sense, since we expect the geometry to crunch in\ntime of order `1 and there isn't really a good asymptotic limit.\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fWe begin by writing expressions for \u03c6 and V in terms of a:\n\u0012 0 \u00132\n8\u03c0G 02\na\n1\na00\n\u03c6 =\n\u2212 2\u2212\nd\u22122\na\na\na\n\u0012 0 \u00132\n16\u03c0G\n1 a00\n1\na\n\u2212\n.\nV\n(\u03c6)\n=\n\u2212\n(d \u2212 2)2\na2\na\nd\u22122 a\n\n(2.19)\n\nThe first of these make it clear that throughout the physical range of \u03be we must have\na02 \u2212 aa00 \u2212 1 \u2265 0.\n\n(2.20)\n\nIn fact if this inequality is satisfied then we can integrate the first equation in (2.19) to\nfind \u03c6(\u03be), which we can then invert and insert into the second equation to find V (\u03c6).4\nThis inequality may appear unusual, but we show in Appendix A that it is equivalent\nto the null energy condition in the region produced by the continuation (2.11).\nAdditional constraints come from the Lorentzian continuation. We want \u00e21 (t) to\nbe real and positive for all t > 0, and also to obey (2.15), (2.16), or (2.17), with the\ncaveat that in the last case (2.17) \u00e21 (t) need only be positive before the crunch. If the\nfalse vacuum is dS then we want \u00e22 (t) to be real and positive for all t > 0 and to obey\n(2.18). By continuing (2.19) we see that to reconstruct the scalar field and potential\nwe need both \u00e21 and \u00e22 to obey\n \u0308 \u2212 1 \u2265 0.\n\u00e2 \u0307 2 \u2212 \u00e2\u00e2\n\n(2.21)\n\nThis inequality is again equivalent to the null energy condition in these two regions.\nWe claim that these are all of the constraints that a proposed a(\u03be) needs to obey to\nbe considered a CDL geometry.\nThe condition that \u00e21 (t) is real can be rewritten in a nice way by observing that\nin a neighborhood around \u03be = 0 we can see from the Taylor expansion for a(\u03be) that it\nis equivalent to\na(\u2212\u03be) = \u2212a(\u03be).\n(2.22)\nBy analytic continuation this equation must hold in any simply-connected region containing \u03be = 0 in which a(\u03be) is analytic. Conversely, (2.22) (together with the reality\nand positivity of a(\u03be) on (0, \u03bec )) implies that \u00e21 (t) is real and positive for small positive\nt, and by analytic continuation must be so for all t > 0 unless we encounter a zero or\nsingularity. Similarly the condition that \u00e22 (t) is real is equivalent to\na(\u03bec \u2212 \u03be) = \u2212a(\u03bec + \u03be).\n\n(2.23)\n\nA final condition we would like to have is that the vacua involved are at least\nmetastable and not unstable. If the geometry is compact then the late time behaviour\n4\n\nIf there are places where the inequality is saturated and \u03c6 comes to a rest, this inversion is slightly\nmore subtle. This happens for example inside the bubble if the field oscillates about the true minimum\nbefore settling down, as in reheating. This subtlety does not affect our ability to find the potential\nsince the scalar traverses all relevant parts of the potential at least once.\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\f(2.15-2.18) of \u00e21,2 ensures that the scalar field is rolling down to a minimum in both\nasymptotic regions. But if the geometry is noncompact then the false vacuum is\nreached already in the Euclidean geometry as \u03be \u2192 \u221e, and there is no \u00e22 . So if we do\nnot impose an additional condition, then the constraints we have stated so far allow\nsituations where there is an unstable Minkowski or AdS maximum that the field rolls\ndown from, which we feel does not deserve the name of a CDL geometry since it is\nnot a tunnelling process. If the false vacuum is Minkowski we thus need to demand\nthat V 00 (\u03c6(\u03be)) > 0 as \u03be \u2192 \u221e. The simplest way to achieve this is to demand that the\npotential is decreasing as \u03be \u2192 \u221e, which from (2.19) means that\n!0\n\u0012 0 \u00132\n1\na\n1 a00\n\u2212\n\u2212\n<0\nas \u03be \u2192 \u221e.\n(2.24)\na2\na\nd\u22122 a\nNote that unlike our other restrictions, this one depends on the dimension d. If the\nfalse vacuum is AdS, then a maximum should be allowed if its negative mass-squared\nobeys the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound [13]\nV 00 (\u03c6(\u03be)) > \u2212\n\n(d \u2212 1)2\n4(`2 )2\n\nas \u03be \u2192 \u221e.\n\n(2.25)\n\nThe potential in this inequality is written in terms of a by using (2.19). Examples of\npotentials with metastable maxima of this type were given in [14, 15].\nWe can now gather the results of this section into a definition; a function a(\u03be) is\na \"CDL Geometry\" if:\n(a) It is real and positive on a real interval \u03be \u2208 (0, \u03bec ), possibly with \u03bec \u2192 \u221e.\n(b) Near \u03be = 0 it obeys (2.7), and if \u03bec is finite then it obeys (2.8). If \u03bec is infinite then\nas \u03be \u2192 \u221e either a(\u03be) \u223c e\u03be/`2 (\"tunnelling from AdS\") or a(\u03be) \u2192 \u03be (\"tunnelling\nfrom Minkowski\").\n(c) It is analytic in a simply connected region D containing the real interval [0, \u03bec ],\nthe positive imaginary axis,5 and if \u03bec is finite the ray R defined by \u03be = \u03bec + it\nwith t > 0.\n(d) There are no zeros of a on the positive imaginary axis or on R if \u03bec is finite, and\nthroughout D we have a(\u2212\u03be) = \u2212a(\u03be). If \u03bec is finite we also have a(\u03bec \u2212 \u03be) =\n\u2212a(\u03bec + \u03be) and the dS asymptotic (2.18).\n(e) On the real interval [0, \u03bec ] we have the null energy condition (2.20). On the\npositive imaginary axis and on R if \u03bec is finite, we have the null energy condition\n(2.21).\n(f) If \u03bec is infinite then for \"tunnelling from Minkowski\" the inequality (2.24) is\nsatisfied, while for \"tunnelling from AdS\" we have (2.25).\n5\n\nFor tunnelling to (crunching) AdS we only include the open interval between the origin and the\nfirst zero of a on the positive imaginary axis. This also applies to constraints (d) and (e).\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fIn this definition we assumed that the false vacuum was at a finite point in field space.\nIf we wish to restrict to cases where the true vacuum is also at a finite point in field\nspace then we can introduce an additional requirement:\n(g) For large purely imaginary \u03be we have the asymptotic geometry (2.15), (2.16), or\n(2.17).\n2.4\n\nCompact Coleman-De Luccia Geometries\n\nBefore presenting our examples of CDL geometries, we will make some special observations about the compact case. We first note that the reality conditions (2.22) and\n(2.23) allow continuation of a(\u03be) to a neighborhood of the full real axis and together\nimply the periodicity\na(\u03be + 2\u03bec ) = a(\u03be).\n(2.26)\nThus for the compact case we have Fourier Analysis at our disposal. We will henceforth\nchoose units where \u03bec = \u03c0, after which we see that we may write\na(\u03be) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\ncn sin(n\u03be).\n\n(2.27)\n\nn=1\n\nThere are no cosines because the function is odd. This form is not the most useful\nhowever because the boundary conditions (2.7) and (2.8) imply nontrivial constraints\non the cn 's. We can reorganize the series using trigonometric identities to take the\nform\na(\u03be) = sin(\u03be) [1 + f (sin \u03be) + cos(\u03be)g(sin \u03be)] ,\n(2.28)\nwhere f (*) and g(*) are even functions which go to zero as their argument goes to zero,\nand which are analytic in a region containing the real interval (0, 1] and also the pure\nimaginary axis. This form is completely general; any compact CDL geometry must\nhave it. It is convenient because it automatically incorporates the reality conditions\nand boundary conditions at 0 and \u03c0, so the only remaining things to check are that\nthe scale factor is nonvanishing, the null energy condition is satisfied, and that at late\ntimes outside the bubble we have (2.18). The cosine term has a simple interpretation\nin that it breaks the symmetry between the two minima. In particular, the analytic\ncontinuations (2.9) and (2.13) give\n\u00e21,2 (t) = sinh(t) [1 + f (i sinh t) \u00b1 cosh(t)g(i sinh t)] ,\n\n(2.29)\n\nwhich are real because f and g are even functions. Here \u00e21 (or \u00e22 ) takes the plus (or\nminus) sign. Depending on the desired nature of the true vacuum we might also like\nto impose (2.15), (2.16), or (2.17).\n\n3\n\nExamples\n\nIn this section, we first derive some general results that illustrate the difficulty of\nconstructing geometries that satisfy our definition. In the following subsections we\nthen give a series of explicit examples.\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fIn writing down functions a(\u03be) that obey our constraints (a)\u2013(g), the biggest\nchallenge is the null energy conditions (2.20) and (2.21). We first consider the case\nwhere a(\u03be) (or \u00e2(t)) is linear with unit coefficient both at \u03be = 0 and \u03be \u2192 \u221e. This is\nappropriate for tunnelling to or from Minkowski space. We parametrize this as\na(\u03be) = \u03be(1 + \u03b4(\u03be)).\n\n(3.1)\n\nHere \u03b4(\u03be) must go to zero both at \u03be = 0 and \u03be = \u221e, and we must have \u03b4 > \u22121 to\navoid collapse. If there is a point where \u22121 < \u03b4 < 0, then by continuity \u03b4 must have\na minimum \u03bemin with \u22121 < \u03b4(\u03bemin ) < 0. The null energy condition however takes the\nform\n\u03b4(2 + \u03b4) + \u03be 2 \u03b4 02 \u2212 \u03b4 00 \u03be 2 (1 + \u03b4) \u2265 0,\n(3.2)\nand it is easy to check that a local minimum with \u22121 < \u03b4 < 0 necessarily violates it.\nThus we must have\n\u03b4 \u2265 0.\n(3.3)\nWe can use this observation to constrain the behaviour of a near \u03be = 0. We can expand\n\u03b4(\u03be) = A\u03be n + O(\u03be n+2 ), with n some even integer greater than 1. Inserting this into\n(3.2) we find that if n > 2 then we must have A < 0, which is not allowed because\nthen near \u03be = 0 we would have \u03b4 < 0. So \u03b4(\u03be) must start out like A\u03be 2 with A > 0. We\ncan also rule out the possibility that \u03b4 is a rational function. If \u03b4 were rational then\nat large \u03be it would scale like \u03be \u2212n for some positive integer n. From (3.2), we find the\nrestriction n(n + 1) \u2264 2. The only possibility is n = 1, but if \u03b4 is rational then this is\nimpossible since (2.22) requires \u03b4 to be an even function of \u03be. In our examples below\nwe overcome this by including radicals.\nAnother constraint of this type is that when the false vacuum is de Sitter, its\nradius must be greater than 1 in the units where \u03bec = \u03c0:\n\u03bec\n.\n(3.4)\n\u03c0\nIn the thin-wall limit, this is the statement that if we draw the Euclidean CDL instanton\nas a piece of a sphere glued to a piece of flat space, the hyperbolic plane, or a larger\nsphere, the radius of the sphere corresponding to the metastable dS vacuum is always\nlarger than the \"size\" \u03bec of the instanton divided by \u03c0.6 We show this is generally true\nin Appendix B. Note that when the \"true\" vacuum is also dS this also implies that\n`1 > 1 since `1 > `2 by definition. This constraint implies that the even functions f (*)\nand g(*) in equation (2.28) cannot both be rational, as this would lead to scaling (2.18)\nwith `\u22121\n2 = (n + 1) and n \u2208 Z (we are now setting \u03bec = \u03c0). This is clearly impossible\nif `2 > 1. So again in the compact case we will include radicals to avoid this problem.\n`2 >\n\n3.1\n\nDe Sitter Domain Walls\n\nOur simplest example of a CDL geometry describes a one-parameter family of (thick)\ndomain walls interpolating between two degenerate dS minima. Geometries that describe genuine decays are given later, as they are in general more complicated. The\n6\n\nOne can also think of this as a bound on the proper length \u03bec of the warped de Sitter region\n(2.12).\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fdomain walls are simple because in these cases a(\u03be) is symmetric under \u03be \u2194 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03be and\ntherefore only involves sin \u03be when written in the form (2.28). Our domain walls are\ngiven by\ns\nr\n2\na(\u03be) = c 1 \u2212 1 \u2212 2 sin2 \u03be,\n(3.5)\nc\n\u221a\nwhere c is any constant greater than 2, as required by the reality of the inner square\nroot. As \u03be approaches 0 or \u03c0 we may expand the inner square root and check the\nsmoothness conditions (2.7) and (2.8). We also need to check the null energy condition\n(2.20), which reads\np\n2\nc2 \u2212 2 sin2 \u03be) 2\n(c\n\u2212\n2)(c\n\u2212\nsin \u03be \u2265 0,\n(3.6)\na02 \u2212 aa00 \u2212 1 =\n(c2 \u2212 2 sin2 \u03be)3/2\n\u221a\nwhich is manifestly satisfied for any c \u2265 2.\nNext, we analytically continue (3.5) to Lorentzian signature by applying (2.9).\nThe resulting scale factor is\nsr\n2\n1 + 2 sinh2 t \u2212 1,\n(3.7)\n\u00e21 (t) = c\nc\nwhose late time behavior is\n\u00e21 (t) \u2192\n\nr\n\nc\n\u221a et/2\n2\n\nas t \u2192 \u221e.\n\n(3.8)\n\nMatching this to (2.16), we find an asymptotically dS space with radius `1 = 2. This\nagrees with the bound `2 > 1 mentioned earlier and proven in Appendix B (here\n`1 = `2 ). We still need to check the null energy condition (2.21), which is simply the\nanalytic continuation of (3.6):\np\n2\nc2 + 2 sinh2 t \u2212 c)\n(c\n\u2212\n2)(\n \u03081 \u2212 1 =\n\u00e2 \u0307 21 \u2212 \u00e21 \u00e2\nsinh2 t \u2265 0.\n(3.9)\n(c2 + 2 sinh2 t)3/2\nBy symmetry the second analytic continuation (2.13) gives exactly the same \u00e22 (t) =\n\u00e21 (t).\nWe have verified that (3.5) satisfies all conditions (a)\u2013(g) to be a CDL geometry.\nWe may then use (2.19) to solve for \u03c6(\u03be) and V (\u03c6). Their analytic forms are not very\nilluminating, as \u03c6(\u03be) involves a hypergeometric function and V (\u03c6) is written in terms\nof the inverse of \u03c6(\u03be). However, in many applications of CDL (such as calculating the\ncorrelation functions) it is a(\u03be) that we would like to be simple, not V (\u03c6).\n3.2\n\nDecays from dS to dS\n\nIn Sec. 3.1 we discussed domain walls interpolating between two degenerate dS minima.\nWhen this degeneracy is broken, we arrive at the phenomenologically interesting case\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\f[16] of decays from one dS space to another with a smaller cosmological constant. We\ngive analytic examples of such geometries in this subsection.\nIn order to interpolate between two dS minima with different cosmological constants, it is necessary to break the symmetry of a(\u03be) under \u03be \u2194 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03be. In the form\n(2.28) this means that a(\u03be) has to depend on cos \u03be in addition to sin \u03be. Under the\nanalytic continuations (2.9) and (2.13), cos \u03be becomes cosh t and \u2212 cosh t respectively\nas we see in (2.29). This minus sign is crucial in making the late time behaviors of\n\u00e21 (t) and \u00e22 (t) different, which is necessary for them to describe asymptotically dS\nspaces with different cosmological constants.\nOne of the simplest examples that we found is\n\uf8f61/2\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\na(\u03be) = \uf8ed\n\n1 + 101/4\n\uf8f7\nh\n\u0010p\n\u0011i1/4 \uf8f8\n1 + 10 \u2212 sin2 \u03be\n2 \u2212 sin2 \u03be + cos \u03be\n\nsin \u03be.\n\n(3.10)\n\nOne can show that this is of the form (2.28) by first writing out its Taylor expansion\nin terms of sin \u03be and cos \u03be, and then eliminating all quadratic or higher order terms in\ncos \u03be by applying cos2 \u03be = 1 \u2212 sin2 \u03be. One can check the null energy conditions (2.20)\nand (2.21). Upon analytic continuation we have\n\uf8f61/2\n\n\uf8eb\n1/4\n\n\uf8ec\n\u00e21,2 (t) = \uf8ed\n\n1 + 10\n\uf8f7\nh\n\u0010p\n\u0011i1/4 \uf8f8\n1 + 10 + sinh2 t\n2 + sinh2 t \u00b1 cosh t\n\nwhere \u00e21 (t) takes the plus sign and asymptotes to\n\u221a\n1 + 101/4 5t/8\n\u00e21 (t) \u2192\ne\nas t \u2192 \u221e,\n23/4\nand \u00e22 (t) takes the minus sign and asymptotes to\n\u221a\n1 + 101/4 7t/8\ne\nas t \u2192 \u221e.\n\u00e22 (t) \u2192\n23/4\n\nsinh t,\n\n(3.11)\n\n(3.12)\n\n(3.13)\n\nThe radii of the two dS vacua are `1 = 8/5 and `2 = 8/7, which again obey the bound\nof Appendix B. We show this geometry in d = 4 in Figure 2, together with the scalar\npotential that gives rise to it.\nA family of geometries of this type can be found by varying the parameters in\n(3.10) (subject to the smoothness and null energy conditions). We will not give the\nexact parameter space here, but we note that it is quite large. For instance, one can\nverify that all constraints are still satisfied if we change both constants \"10\" in (3.10)\nto any number larger than 4.2, or if we change the power 1/4 to any number between\n0 and 1/4.\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\f`\na1\n\na\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n20\n15\n10\n5\n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0\n\n\u039e\n\n1\n\n`\na2\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nt\n\nV\n\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n\nt\n\n\u03a60\n\n\u03a6c\n\u03a62\n\n\u03a61\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n\u03a6\n\nFigure 2.

The geometry and potential describing a decay from dS to asymptotically\nMinkowski space. See the caption of Figure 2 for detailed explanations.\n\nAs before, a family of geometries of this type can be found by varying the parameters in (3.14). Additionally, we could get CDL geometries that describe decays from\ndS to FRW which has a zero cosmological constant but does not have the asymptotic\nbehavior (2.15). As discussed above (2.15) this means that the scalar field is rolling\noff to infinity in the FRW. A particular class of interesting FRW solutions of this type\nwas studied in [8] and conjectured to have holographic duals. They are characterized\nby the following late time behavior:\n\u00e21 (t) \u2192 ct as t \u2192 \u221e.\n\n(3.18)\n\nWe give analytic CDL geometries of this type by multiplying the \"arcsin\" term in\n(3.14) by a constant c > 1, and multiplying the first term by (2 \u2212 c) to preserve the\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\fsmoothness conditions.7 Over a range of c the null energy conditions are satisfied, and\nwe get an asymptotically linear scale factor \u00e21 (t) \u2192 ct with c > 1.\n3.4\n\nNoncompact Examples\n\nNoncompact examples have simpler functional forms, but have the added complication\nof the conditions (2.24) or (2.25). These decays are arguably the least interesting,\nsince exactly Minkowski spaces are expected to be supersymmetric and stable, and\nmetastable AdS is inherently ill-defined [20\u201322]. A candidate example for a decay of\nMinkowski space to a crunch is\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03be2\n.\n(3.19)\na(\u03be) = \u03be 1 +\n(1 + \u03be 2 )3/2\nThe radical is still necessary because of the argument given below equation (3.3). This\nobeys the null energy conditions (2.20) and (2.21), and crunches inside the bubble at\nfinite time. For d = 4 however it corresponds to rolling down from a maximum, and\nwe find we need to set d = 3 to satisfy (2.24). This can be checked analytically by\nexpanding (2.24) to order 1/\u03be 6 at large \u03be.8 An improved example that works in d = 4\nis\n!\n2\n\u03be\n.\n(3.20)\na(\u03be) = \u03be 1 + p\n1 + \u03be6\nWe can show that the potential leading to this geometry has a metastable minimum\nby expanding (2.24) to order 1/\u03be 10 . This potential is shown in Figure 4.\n\nV\n\nV\n\n10\n-10\n-20\n-30\n\n\u03a6c\n1\n\n2\n\n\u03a60\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n0.4\n0.2\n\n\u03a6\n\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.6\n\n\u03a6c\n3.6 3.8 4.0 4.2 4.4 4.6 4.8\n\n\u03a6\n\nFigure 4. The potential V (\u03c6) leading to a CDL geometry (3.20) describing the decay from\nMinkowski space to a crunching AdS. On the right we zoom in on the same potential at \u03c6c\n(the asymptotic field value) and see that it is a local minimum with a very shallow barrier.\n7\n\nThe lower limit c > 1 is required by the null energy condition (2.21). The apparent upper limit\nc < 2 is superficial and can be relaxed by changing the \"2\" inside the arcsin in (3.14).\n8\nNote that for the compact examples in the previous subsections the dimension was irrelevant.\nIt is only for noncompact geometries that we have the inequalities (2.24) or (2.25) which depend on\ndimension.\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\fA candidate family of decays of AdS to a crunch is\n\u03be\na(\u03be) = (1 + c) sinh \u03be \u2212 2c sinh .\n2\n\n(3.21)\n\nThis example is simple enough that we can check the null energy conditions (2.20) and\n(2.21) analytically, finding that any c > 0 is allowed.

We first apply this to the \"warped de Sitter\" geometry (2.12), which\nwe rewrite as\nds2 = d\u03be 2 + a(\u03be)2 \u03b3ij dxi dxj .\n(A.2)\nThe Ricci tensor is\na00\nR\u03be\u03be = \u2212(d \u2212 1)\na\n\u0002\n\u0003\nRij = \u2212 aa00 + (d \u2212 2)(a02 \u2212 1) \u03b3ij\nR\u03bei = Ri\u03be = 0,\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n(A.3)\n\n\fso the Einstein tensor is\n\"\u0012 \u0013\n#\n2\n(d \u2212 1)(d \u2212 2)\na0\n1\nG\u03be\u03be =\n\u2212 2\n2\na\na\n\"\n!#\n\u0012 0 \u00132\na00 (d \u2212 2)(d \u2212 3)\na\n1\nGij = (d \u2212 2) +\na2 \u03b3ij\n\u2212 2\na\n2\na\na\nG\u03bei = Gi\u03be = 0.\n\n(A.4)\n\nTo check the null energy condition, consider the radial null vector k = \u2202\u03be + a1 \u2202\u03c9 .9\nContracting this with G\u03bc\u03bd we find (A.1) is satisfied if\n\u0012 0 \u00132\na\n1\na00\n\u2212 2\u2212\n\u2265 0,\na\na\na\n\n(A.5)\n\nwhich agrees with (2.20). We can easily continue this Einstein tensor to find the\nEinstein tensor for the open FRW metric (2.10), and a similar computation confirms\n(2.21).\n\nB\n\nA Bound on Parent dS Radius\n\nIn this appendix we show that for any compact CDL geometry describing the decay of\ndS space, the parent dS radius (which is `2 according to (2.18)) must be greater than\n\u03bec /\u03c0. In the convenient units proposed in Sec. 2.4 where \u03bec = \u03c0, this means `2 > 1.\nWe will not need to know what kind of space the parent dS decays into, whether it is\ndS, AdS, Minkowski space, or even something else.\nWe prove this by using the null energy conditions (2.20) and (2.21). First, we\nnote that it is impossible for a(\u03be) or \u00e2(t) to have a local minimum within their physical\ndomains. Clearly if for example a(\u03be) had a local minimum, we would have a0 (\u03be) = 0\nand a00 (\u03be) \u2265 0 there, manifestly violating the null energy condition (2.20). Therefore it\nis impossible to have a contracting phase followed by an expanding phase. Combining\nthis with the boundary conditions (2.7) and (2.8), we find that a(\u03be) must monotonically\nincrease to a maximum at some \u03bem and after that monotonically decrease to 0. For \u00e22 (t)\nthere has to an expanding phase (2.18) at late times, so \u00e22 (t) must be a monotonically\nincreasing function for all t \u2265 0.\nLet us define an \"energy function\" E \u2261 (a02 \u2212 1)/a2 and take its derivative\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd a02 \u2212 1\n2a0 (a02 \u2212 aa00 \u2212 1)\ndE\n=\n=\u2212\n.\n(B.1)\nd\u03be\nd\u03be\na2\na3\nUsing the null energy condition (2.20), we find that E never increases in an expanding\nphase and never decreases in a contracting phase. For a more physical argument, we\n9\n\nAny nonradial vector can be boosted into a radial one unless it lies entirely within the dS slice,\nbut in that case the Null Energy Condition is trivially saturated since the dS Einstein tensor is\nproportional to the metric.\n\n\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n\fnote that E is equal to the total energy up to a constant coefficient, as we can see\nfrom the second equation in (2.3).10 The total energy is drained by friction during an\nexpanding phase and replenished by anti-friction during a contracting phase. Exactly\nthe same statements hold for \u00ca2 \u2261 (\u00e2 \u0307 22 \u2212 1)/\u00e222 .\nIt is therefore clear that E(\u03be) reaches an absolute minimum exactly as a(\u03be) reaches\nits maximum at \u03bem :\nE(\u03be) \u2265 E(\u03bem ) = \u2212\n\n1\na(\u03bem )2\n\n\u2200\u03be \u2208 [0, \u03bec ].\n\nfor\n\n(B.2)\n\nLet us abbreviate a(\u03bem ) as am . For the expanding phase 0 \u2264 \u03be \u2264 \u03bem we rewrite the\nabove inequality as\na0\np\n\u22651\n(B.3)\n1 \u2212 a2 /a2m\nand integrate both sides from \u03be = 0 to \u03be = \u03bem , which gives\n\u03c0\nam \u2265 \u03bem .\n2\n\n(B.4)\n\nFor the contracting phase \u03bem \u2264 \u03be \u2264 \u03bec there is a minus sign on the left hand side of\n(B.3). After integrating from \u03bem to \u03bec we find\n\u03c0\nam \u2265 \u03bec \u2212 \u03bem .\n2\n\n(B.5)\n\nCombining this with (B.4) we arrive at\n\u03c0am \u2265 \u03bec .\n\n(B.6)\n\nFinally, we argue that am is bounded from above by `2 . From the analytic continuation (2.13) we find\nE|\u03be=\u03bec =\n\na02 \u2212 1\na2\n\n=\u2212\n\u03be=\u03bec\n\n\u00e2 \u0307 22 \u2212 1\n\u00e222\n\n= \u2212\u00ca2 |t=0 .\n\n(B.7)\n\nt=0\n\nPhysically, the field is at rest when \u03be = \u03bec or t = 0, so the total \"Euclidean energy\" \u2212V (\u03c6c ) is just minus the \"Lorentzian energy\". From this we have a chain of\n(in)equalities\n\u2212\n\n1\n1\n=\nE|\n\u2264\nE|\n=\n\u2212\n\u00ca\n|\n\u2264\n\u2212\n\u00ca\n|\n=\n\u2212\n,\n\u03be=\u03be\n\u03be=\u03be\n2\nt=0\n2\nt\u2192\u221e\nm\nc\na2m\n`22\n\n(B.8)\n\nwhere we have the first inequality because E never decreases in a contracting phase,\nand the second inequality because \u00ca2 never increases in an expanding phase. The last\nequality comes from the asymptotically dS condition (2.18). Therefore we have\nam \u2264 `2 .\n10\n\n(B.9)\n\nThe Euclidean equations of motion (2.3) are completely the same as the Lorentzian equations\n(2.14) with the inverted potential \u2212V (\u03c6), so we may use our usual intuition about real-time evolution.\n\n\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n\fCombining this with (B.6), we have shown the bound on the parent dS radius\n`2 >\n\n\u03bec\n.\n\u03c0\n\n(B.10)\n\nThis inequality cannot be saturated without saturating all the above inequalities. In\nparticular, saturating (B.2) and (B.9) leads to a(\u03be) = `2 sin(\u03be/`2 ) which describes a\npure dS geometry rather than a CDL decay.\n\nReferences\n[1] S. R. Coleman and F.
