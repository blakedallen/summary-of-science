Our proposal to realize an asymmetric collider,\nin which polarized protons with momenta of about 3.5 GeV/c collide with polarized\nantiprotons with momenta up to 15 GeV/c, is well\u2013suited to perform a direct measurement of the transversity distribution function h1 . In this report we summarize\nthe outcome of various working group meetings within the PAX collaboration. The\noverall machine setup at the HESR, proposed by the PAX collaboration, is described\nalong with the associated PAX experimental program.\n\nThe possibility to test the nucleon structure via double spin asymmetries in polarized\nproton\u2013antiproton reactions at the HESR ring of FAIR at GSI has been suggested by the\nPAX collaboration last year in Ref. [1]. Since then, there has been much progress, both in\nunderstanding the physics potential of such an experiment [2, 3, 4, 5] and in studying the\nfeasibility of efficiently producing polarized antiprotons [6]. The physics program of such\na facility would extend to a new domain the exceptionally fruitful studies of the nucleon\nstructure performed in unpolarized and polarized deep inelastic scattering (DIS), which\nhave been at the center of high energy physics during the past four decades. It suffices\nto mention the unique possibility of a direct measurement of the transversity distribution\nfunction h1 , one of the last missing fundamental pieces in the QCD description of the\nnucleon. In the available kinematic domain of the proposed experiment, which covers the\nvalence region, the Drell\u2013Yan double transverse spin asymmetry was recently predicted to\nbe as large as 30% [2, 3]. Other novel tests of QCD at such a facility include the polarized\nelastic hard scattering of antiprotons on protons and the measurement of the phases of\nthe time\u2013like form factors of the proton (see [1]). A viable practical scheme1 which allows\nus to reach a polarization of the stored antiprotons at HESR\u2013FAIR of \u2243 30% has been\n1\nThe basic approach to polarizing and storing antiprotons at HESR\u2013FAIR is based on solid QED\ncalculations of the spin transfer from electrons to antiprotons [7], which is being routinely used at Jefferson\nLaboratory for the electromagnetic form factor separation [8], and which has been tested and confirmed\nexperimentally in the FILTEX experiment [9].\n\n1\n\n\fworked out and published in Ref. [6].\nIn this brief report we summarize the outcome of various working group meetings of the\nPAX Collaboration, the results of which have been presented in 2004 at several workshops\nand conferences [10]. The PAX collaboration proposes an approach that is composed of\ntwo phases. During these the major milestones of the project can be tested and optimized\nbefore the final goal is approached: A polarized proton\u2013antiproton asymmetric collider, in\nwhich polarized protons with momenta of about 3.5 GeV/c collide with polarized antiprotons with momenta up to 15 GeV/c. These circulate in the HESR, which has already been\napproved and will serve the PANDA experiment. In the following, we will briefly describe\nthe overall machine setup at the HESR, schematically depicted in Fig. 1, as proposed by\nthe PAX collaboration.\n\np\n\np injection\n\nHESR\nAP\np Injector\n\np\n\nCSR\nPAX\nPANDA\n\nFigure 1: The proposed accelerator set\u2013up at the HESR (black), with the equipment used by the\nPAX collaboration in Phase I: CSR (green), AP, beam transfer lines and polarized proton injector\n(all blue). In Phase II, by adding two transfer lines (red), an asymmetric collider is set up. It\nshould be noted that, in this phase, also fixed target operation at PAX is possible.\nLet us summarize the main features of the accelerator setup:\n1. An Antiproton Polarizer (AP) built inside the HESR area with the crucial goal of\npolarizing antiprotons at kinetic energies around \u2248 50 MeV (p \u2248 300 MeV/c), to be\naccelerated and injected into the other rings.\n2. A second Cooler Synchrotron Ring (CSR, COSY\u2013like) in which protons or antiprotons can be stored with a momentum up to 3.5 GeV/c. This ring shall have a\nstraight section, where a PAX detector could be installed, running parallel to the\nexperimental straight section of HESR.\n3. By deflection of the HESR beam into the straight section of the CSR, both the\ncollider or the fixed\u2013target mode become feasible.\nIt is worthwhile to stress that, through the employment of the CSR, effectively a second interaction point is formed with minimum interference with PANDA. The proposed\nsolution opens the possibility to run two different experiments at the same time.\n\n2\n\n\fThe physics program should be pursued in two different phases.\n(I) A beam of unpolarized or polarized antiprotons with momentum up to 3.5 GeV/c\nin the CSR ring, colliding on a polarized hydrogen target in the PAX detector. This\nphase is independent of the HESR performance.\nThis first phase, at moderately high energy, will allow for the first time the measurement of the time\u2013like proton form factors in single and double polarized p\u0304p interactions in a wide kinematical range, from close to threshold up to Q2 = 8.5 GeV2 . It\nwould enable to determine several double spin asymmetries in elastic p\u0304\u2191 p\u2191 scattering.\nBy detecting back scattered antiprotons one can also explore hard scattering regions\nof large t: In proton\u2013proton scattering the same region of t requires twice the energy.\nThere are no competing facilities at which these topical issues can be addressed. For\nthe theoretical background, see the PAX LoI [1] and the recent review paper [4].\n(II) This phase will allow the first ever direct measurement of the quark transversity\ndistribution h1 , by measuring the double transverse spin asymmetry AT T in Drell\u2013\nYan processes p\u2191 p\u0304\u2191 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 X as a function of Bjorken x and Q2 (= M 2 )\nP 2 q\n2\n2 q\nd\u03c3 \u2191\u2191 \u2212 d\u03c3 \u2191\u2193\nq eq h1 (x1 , M )h1 (x2 , M )\nP\n= \u00e2T T\n,\nAT T \u2261\n2\n2\n2\nd\u03c3 \u2191\u2191 + d\u03c3 \u2191\u2193\nq eq q(x1 , M )q(x2 , M )\nwhere q = u, u, d, d . . ., M is the invariant mass of the lepton pair and \u00e2T T , of the\norder of one, is the calculable double\u2013spin asymmetry of the QED elementary process\nqq \u2192 e+ e\u2212 . Two possible scenarios might be foreseen to perform the measurement.\n(a) Asymmetric Collider: A beam of polarized antiprotons from 1.5 GeV/c up\nto 15 GeV/c circulating in the HESR, colliding on a beam of polarized protons\nwith momenta up to 3.5 GeV/c circulating in the CSR. This scenario however\nrequires to demonstrate that a suitable luminosity is reachable. Deflection of\nthe HESR beam to the PAX detector in the CSR is necessary (see Fig. 1).\nBy proper variation of the energy of the two colliding beams, this setup would\nallow a measurement of the transversity distribution h1 in the valence region of\nx > 0.05, with corresponding Q2 = 4 . . . 100 GeV2 (see Fig. 2). AT T is predicted\nto be larger than 20 % over the full\n\u221a kinematic range, up to the highest reachable\n\u221a\ncenter\u2013of\u2013mass energy of s \u223c 200. The cross section is large as well: With\na luminosity of 5 * 1030 cm\u22122 s\u22121 about 2000 events per day can be expected2 .\nFor the transversity distribution h1 , such an experiment can be considered as\nthe analogue of polarized DIS for the determination of the helicity structure\nfunction g1 , i.e. of the helicity distribution \u2206q(x, Q2 ); the kinematical coverage\n(x, Q2 ) will be similar to that of the HERMES experiment.\n(b) High luminosity fixed target experiment: If the required luminosity in\nthe collider mode is not achievable, a fixed target experiment can be conducted.\nA beam of 22 GeV/c (15 GeV/c) polarized antiprotons circulating in the HESR\nis used to collide with a polarized internal hydrogen target. Also this scenario\nrequires the deflection of the HESR beam to the PAX detector in the CSR (see\nFig. 1).\n2\n\nA first estimate indicates that in the collider mode luminosities in excess of 1030 cm\u22122 s\u2212 1 could be\nreached. We are presently evaluating the influence of intra-beam scattering, which seems to be one of the\nlimiting factors.\n\n3\n\n\f1\n\ncollider\ns=200\n\nATT/\u00e2TT\n\nx2\n\nA theoretical discussion of the significance of the measurement of AT T for a\n22 GeV/c (15 GeV/c) beam impinging on a fixed target is given in Refs. [2, 3, 5]\nand the recent review paper [4]. The theoretical work on the K\u2013factors for\nthe transversity determination is in progress [11, 12]. This measurement will\nexplore the valence region of x > 0.2, with corresponding Q2 = 4 . . . 16 GeV2\n(see Fig. 2). In this region AT T is predicted to be large (of the order of 30 %,\nor more) and the expected number of events can be of the order of 2000 per\nday.\n\nfixed target\ns=45\n\n0.3\n\n0.8\n\n30\n45\n0.6\n\n80\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n200\n0.1\n\n1000\n\n400\n\n0.2\n\ns = 10000\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nxF\n\nx1\n\nFigure 2: Left: The kinematic region covered by the h1 measurement at PAX in phase II. In\nthe asymmetric collider\n(blue) antiprotons of 15 GeV/c impinge on protons of 3.5 GeV/c\n\u221a\n\u221a scenario\nat c.m. energies of s \u223c 200 GeV and Q2 > 4 GeV2 . The fixed\n\u221a case (red) represents\n\u221a target\nantiprotons of 22 GeV/c colliding with a fixed polarized target ( s \u223c 45 GeV). Right: The\nexpected asymmetry as a function of Feynman xF for different values of s and Q2 = 16 GeV2 .\n\nWe would like to mention, that we are also investigating whether the PANDA detector, properly modified, is compatible with the transversity measurements in the\ncollider mode, where an efficient identification of the Drell\u2013Yan pairs is required. At\nthe interaction point, the spins of the colliding protons and antiprotons should be\nvertical, with no significant component along the beam direction.\nTo summarize, we note that the storage of polarized antiprotons at HESR will open\nunique possibilities to test QCD in hitherto unexplored domains. This will provide another\ncornerstone to the antiproton program at FAIR.\n\nReferences\n[1] PAX LoI, http://www.fz-juelich.de/ikp/pax\n[2] M. Anselmino, V. Barone, A. Drago and N.
