Bean and J. Livingston [1] vortex entry in a Type II superconductor submitted to a magnetic\nfield parallel to its surface can be delayed beyond the field\nHc1 where the mixed state becomes thermodynamically\nstable in the bulk. Vortex entry may not occur up to a\nfield of the order of the thermodynamical critical field Hc\nwhere the free energies of the normal and full Meissner\nstates become equal. The delayed vortex entry comes\nfrom the attraction between a vortex and its anti-vortex\nimage. The vortex is however also submitted to a repulsive force from Meissner surface screening currents (Fig.\n1. At low applied fields these Meissner currents are weak,\nthe vortex - anti-vortex attraction wins and a surface energy barrier prevents vortex penetration in the bulk. At\nhigh fields, Meissner currents are strong, the repulsive\ninteraction wins, the surface barrier disappears and vortices can penetrate freely. The attractive and repulsive\ninteractions balance each other at a field of the order of\nHc . In practice, vortex penetration occurs in general at\na field lower than Hc , as the sample surface roughness\ncan locally enhance the surface field value above that of\nthe applied field because of demagnetization effects.\nRecently, Iniotakis et.al. [2] have predicted than in\na dx2 \u2212y2 wave superconductor having its surface normal\nparallel to a nodal direction, vortex penetration for fields\napplied along the z direction (the c-axis perpendicular\nto the CuO planes in the cuprates, see Fig. 2) can be\ndelayed well beyond the field of first vortex entry Hs .\nThe increase of the barrier, being particularly significant\nat low temperatures, is due to is due to strong surface\ncurrents carried by Andreev - Saint-James bound states\n[3]. This current is paramagnetic and flows in the opposite direction with regards to that of the diamagnetic\nscreening Meissner current. A schematic illustration of\nthe currents is presented in Fig. 1. One must notice that\nthe Fogelstr\u00f6m paramagnetic current flows at a distance\nof the order of the coherence length \u03be from the surface\nwhile the Meissner screening current flows at the scale\nof the penetration length \u03bb from the surface. The effect\nof the paramagnetic current on vortex entry is to reduce\nthe repulsive force driving the vortex into the bulk and\n\nJ\n\n\u03be\n\n\u03bb\n\nx\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic representation of a vortex and its antivortex image (dotted) together with the sum of Meissner diamagnetic screening current and the Fogelstr\u00f6m surface paramagnetic current. The vortex anti-vortex interaction is attractive, the effect of the diamagnetic Meissner current is repulsive and that of the Fogelstr\u00f6m paramagnetic current is\nattractive. Dashed and full arrows indicate the directions of\nthe paramagnetic and diamagnetic currents. At low temperatures, the sum of both currents becomes paramagnetic on the\nscale of the coherence length \u03be.\n\naway from the surface.\nIn this work, we present a study of the temperaturemagnetic field dependence of the Bean - Livingston surface barrier for vortex entry on the nodal surface of\nslightly overdoped YBa2 Cu3 O7\u2212x (YBCO) thin films.\nOur results basically confirm the theoretical predictions.\nThin films of YBa2 Cu3 O7\u2212x (YBCO) were grown by\nDC off-axis sputtering on substrates of SrTiO3 with (110)\norientation. A buffer layer of PrBa2Cu3 O7\u2212x , was deposited using RF off-axis sputtering on top of the substrate [4] in order to reduce the (103) orientated grains.\nThe YBCO growth time was 3 hours corresponding to\na thickness of 2400\u00c5. Normal metal - Insulator - Superconductor (NIS) junctions were prepared by placing thin\nIndium rods on top of the surface of the thin film[5, 6].\nOxidation of the Indium to InO at the contact area gives\nthe Insulating layer of the NIS junction.

The\nround rod represents the planar tunnel junction (Indium in\ngrey, InO in black).\n\norder parameter. The samples discussed in this work\nwere all slightly overdoped with a Tc downset of 89K.\nAndreev - Saint-James zero energy surface bound\nstates (ASJ bound states) are known to develop at surfaces perpendicular to a node direction, such as (110)\nsurfaces in YBa2 Cu3 O7\u2212x [7, 8]. In a tunneling experiment, these states show up as a Zero Bias Conductance\nPeak (ZBCP), which splits due to a Doppler effect under\nsuperfluid currents flowing parallel to the surface [3] as\noccurs in the geometry show in Fig. 2. We have used\nthis split 2\u03b4 to investigate the field and temperature dependence of the barrier against vortex entry.\nIn films thicker than the London penetration length\nas is the case for the samples investigated here, the field\nevolution is known to be hysteretic, being larger in increasing than in decreasing fields [5, 9, 10]. The split\nin increasing fields has been interpreted as due to the\nDoppler effect induced by Meissner currents [3, 11] while\nthat in decreasing fields has been shown to be a field\nrather than a current effect [10]. A third case is that\nof a field cooled condition, in which there should be no\nBean-Livingston effect. A set of three such measurement\nis shown in Fig. 3. In order to cancel out the field effect, we have characterized currents resulting from the\nBean-Livingston barrier by the difference between values\nof \u03b4 measured in increasing field after cooling the sample in zero field and field cooled conditions, (\u03b4up \u2212 \u03b4F.C. ).\nThis quantity has been measured as a function of field\nand annealing temperature Ta as described in the next\nparagraph.\nIn the absence of any Bean-Livingston barrier effect,\n(\u03b4up \u2212 \u03b4F.C. ) should reach a maximum value at H =\nHc1 . In the presence of a barrier against vortex entry,\n(\u03b4up \u2212 \u03b4F.C. ) should reach its maximum value at the field\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nV [mV]\n\nFIG. 3: dI/dV at 2.5 Tesla for increasing, decreasing and field\ncooled conditions. Defining 2\u03b4 to be the distance between the\ntwo peaks, we note \u03b4 is maximum for increasing field, minimum for decreasing field and has an intermediate value for\nthe field cooled measurement. Inset shows the measurement's\nfull scale (\u00b120mV ) for the decreasing field condition. The\nYBa2 Cu3 O7\u2212x coherence peaks are located at \u223c 16mV .\n\nHS where the barrier disappears (following the notations\nby C. Bean and J. Livingston [1]). Tunneling measurement at relative high temperatures have thermal smearing that makes it impossible to follow the ZBCP splitting. In order to follow the temperature dependance of\nthe barrier by tunneling measurements and to eliminate\nthe effect of thermal smearing on the tunneling characteristic, we have pursue the following procedure in determining the temperature dependence Hs (T ). After cooling in zero field down to 1.4K, the field is raised up to a\nvalue H \u2217 . The temperature is then raised up to a value\nTa (hence annealing temperature) for a time sufficient to\nreach equilibrium (2 minutes), then cooled down again\nto 1.4K for a measurement of \u03b4up (H \u2217 , Ta ). In order to\nreturn to the virgin conditions (zero field cooled from\nabove Tc ), the temperature is then raised up to 105K,\nthe field is lowered to zero, and a new measurement is\ncarried out at a different value of Ta . Once several values\nof Ta have been explored, a new cycle is started with a\ndifferent value of H \u2217 . In order to check if the performed\nfield-thermal cycle damaged the sample or the junction,\nthe tunneling characteristic was measured every time a\nvirgin state was reached and also at the increasing field\nstate at the previous H \u2217 value and compared to the tunneling characteristics obtained at the beginning of the\nmeasurements. No change in the tunneling characteristic occurred during the measurements.\nFig. 4 summarizes our results for (\u03b4up (Ta ) \u2212 \u03b4F.C. ) as\na function of H \u2217 at different annealing temperatures.

At the lowest temperatures, no clear maximum can be seen up to the highest\nfield where the value of \u03b4up (Ta ) can be identified.\nIdeally, the field dependence of (\u03b4up (Ta )\u2212\u03b4F.C. ) should\nshow a sharper maximum than that which we observe\nsince a reduction in surface currents and hence of \u03b4up is\nexpected once vortices start to penetrate. Yet, we tentatively identify the field at maximum with HS . What\nis clear from the data is that surface currents keep increasing up to a field that is much higher than HC1 (of\nthe order of 1 * 10\u22122T esla) at all temperatures, and than\nHC (of the order of 1 T esla [1, 12] ) at low temperatures, this basically confirms the prediction of Iniotakis\net.al. [2]. In order to check whether thermal fluctuations are the reason for the continuous change in \u03b4up , a\nset of measurements was done with much longer time of\ntemperature annealing - up to 6 hours. No difference between the short and long annealing time was found and\nhence - the thermal fluctuation is ruled out from being a\nreason for this behavior.\nAnother way to represent the results is shown Fig. 5,\nwhere the dependence of of \u03b4up (T a) \u2212 \u03b4up (1.4K) is displayed for a fixed field H \u2217 as a function of TTac . \u03b4(H \u2217 )\nis reduced progressively from its value in increasing field\ndown to its field cooled value as a function of the annealing temperature (5). This reduction can be fitted to\nan exponential decay, giving a temperature scale Ts (H \u2217 )\nthat decreases as H \u2217 is increased. Instead of this progressive reduction, one would have expected \u03b4(H \u2217 ) to sustain\nits low temperature value up to the temperature where\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nT/Tc\n\nFIG. 6: Field of first vortex entry as a function of the reduced\ntemperature TTc . The lines correspond to the Bean-Livingston\nfield of first vortex entry, using Hc = 1 T esla [12], in the case\nof conventional superconductor (dashed line) and in the case\nof nodal surface calculated by Iniotakis et. al. [2] (full line).\nThe circles are represent the field where the hysteresis value of\nthe splitting, (\u03b4up (Ta , H \u2217 ) \u2212 \u03b4F.C. ) is at maximum that is HM\ntaken from Fig. 4. The lowest temperature (noted also with a\nquestion mark)is only a lower boundary since no maximum is\nobserved. The stars represent the decay order Ts (H \u2217 ) taken\nfrom Fig. 5. Both methods of analysis show the enhancement\nof Hs for low temperatures.\n\nH \u2217 is equal to the vortex entry field.\nThere are several possible reasons for the observed\nbroad maximum (Fig. 4) and for the continuous decay of\n\u03b4up (Fig. 5). A first one is the surface roughness of the\nsample that can have weak spots for vortex entry where\nthe surface is not (110) oriented. A second one is the\n\n\f4\nheight of the barrier which may become of order KB T\nat high fields. One must also take into account the finite\nthickness of the sample which is only a few penetration\ndepths.\nThe formation of an idxy subdominant order parameter [10, 13], can be expected to reduce the paramagnetic\ncurrents and hence Hs . However, at fields of less than\n3 Tesla the idxy component disappears above about 7K\n[13]. Therefore, it can not effect the results presented in\nFig. 4 and Fig. 5 at temperatures above 14K. As for the\n1.4K data (Fig. 4), it only allows to determine a minimum value for Hs which was not calculated by Iniotakis\net.al. [2].\nTo summarize the results, we show Fig.6 values of\nTs (H \u2217 )\nand of HM ( TTac ). Within error bars, both sets\nTc\nof values fall on the same line, showing that both capture the same physics. The dashed line in Fig. 6 is\nthe temperature dependence of the Bean-Livingston field\nof first entry in a conventional superconductor, taking\nHc = 1 T esla [12]. The solid line is the temperature dependence of the Bean-Livingston field of first entry in the\ncase of a nodal surface, taken from Iniotakis et. al. [2],\nagain with Hc = 1 T esla. The predicted large enhancement is clearly seen experimentally at low temperatures.\nThe reason for the low temperature enhancement of\nthe field of first entry is easily understood. As shown by\nFogelstr\u00f6m et.al. [3] the Andreev - Saint-James states\ncarry paramagnetic currents at nodal surfaces. Iniotakis\net.al. [2] have shown that these currents strongly increase\nat low temperatures, thus reducing the usual repulsive\nLorenz force due to Meissner currents. This reduction\nof the repulsive force allows the attractive force of the\nimage vortex to remain dominant up to higher fields at\nlow temperatures.\nIn order to better understand the barrier further theoretical and experimental work is needed in lower temperatures regime where the barrier is strongly enhanced.\nThe doping dependence of the enhancement and especially the appearance of a subdominant nodal order pa-\n\nrameter can strongly effect the Bean-Livingston barrier\nenhancement due to the node removal effect. In such a\ncase, strong over-doped samples and/or high magnetic\nfields are necessary in order to allow the existence of the\nsubdominant order paramter at temperatures as high as\n0.3Tc [10, 13].\nThe Authors would like to thank S. Hacohen and B.\nAlomg for the use of their low noise dI/dV measurement\nsystem.
