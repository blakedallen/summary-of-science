We focus on the X-ray spectroscopic results\nobtained from a new sample of the 16 broadest Balmer line AGN observed with\nChandra and Swift.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nForty years of research on the Broad Line Regions (BLRs) of Active Galactic\nNuclei (AGN) has not yielded a clear picture of the structures and detailed\nphysical conditions involved in setting the observed line profiles and strengths.\nOur current understanding involves contributions from an outflowing, likely\nclumpy, magnetohydrodynamically or line-driven wind, and an accretion disk\n(e.g, Collin et al. 2006). The BLR is photoionized and must intercept at least\n10% of the radiation from the central engine to produce lines of the observed\nstrengths. If the accretion disk contributes to the BLR emission from AGN,\nwe expect to see a clear signature of this contribution in the form of a doublepeaked line profile, distorted by the effects of Doppler boosting and gravitational\nredshift.\n2.\n\nOptical and UV Properties of Double-Peaked Emitters\n\nAbout 3% of optically selected AGN have H\u03b1 lines with the characteristic\ndouble-peaked shape consistent with accretion-disk emission (Strateva et al. 2003,\nhereafter S03). Among broad-line radio galaxies this fraction is up to 20%\n(Eracleous et al. 2003, hereafter E03), suggesting that Balmer-line accretiondisk emission is more prevalent among AGN with jets and lower luminosities/accretion rates.\nAs a class double-peaked emitters are characterized by broader Balmer lines\n(up to 40,000 km s\u22121 full width at half maximum [FWHM]), similar UV/optical\nluminosities to those of other AGN in the same redshift range, and a higher incidence of LINER characteristics \u2013 for example, larger low-ionization line ratios\nand low-ionization line equivalent widths ([O I] 6300\u00c5/[O III] 5007\u00c5, [S II] EWs,\n1\n\nMPI f\u00fcr extraterrestrische Physik, Postfach 1312, 85741 Garching, Germany\n\n2\n\nDept. of Astronomy and Astrophysics, 525 Davey Lab., University Park, PA 16802, USA\n\n3\n\nCenter for Gravitational Wave Physics, 104 Davey Lab., University Park, PA 16802, USA\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nStrateva et al.\n\n0.01\n10\u22123\n\nCOUNTS s\u22121 keV\u22121\n\netc.; E03, S03). Lewis et al. (2006) report the black-hole masses of 8 doublepeaked emitters based on the stellar velocity dispersions of their host-galaxy\nbulges and find that the accretion rates as a function of Eddington vary considerably even in this small sample, with 10\u22125 < L/LEdd < 0.1. UV observations\nof double-peaked emitters often show single-peaked high-ionization lines (e.g.\nC III], CIV, Ly\u03b1; Halpern et al. 1996), and are likely dominated by emission\nfrom the outflowing BLR component.\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n5\n\nCOUNTS s\u22121 keV\u22121\n\n2\u00d710\u22125\n\n5\u00d710\u22125 10\u22124 2\u00d710\u22124\n\n5\u00d710\u22124\n\nOBSERVED\u2212FRAME ENERGY (keV)\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n5\n\n10\n\nOBSERVED\u2212FRAME ENERGY (keV)\n\nFigure 1. Optical (left panels; both the AGN and AGN+host-galaxy spectra are shown) and X-ray spectra (right panels) of two of the Swift targets.\n\nAxisymmetric accretion-disk fits to the H\u03b1 line profiles of about 3 dozen\nobjects from the E03 and S03 samples constrain the accretion-disk line emission\nto originate between a few hundred and a few thousand RG (gravitational radii)\n1\nfrom the center. The outer radii of emission, typically <\n\u223c 4000 RG , are consistent with the onset of disk self gravity. The disk inclinations range between\n20\u25e6 < i < 75\u25e6 (from the accretion-disk axis), with the inclination distribution\nsuggestive of the presence of coplanar obscuration, whose probability becomes\nexponentially higher for large inclinations. This is consistent with clumpy unification models (see the Elitzur, Sturm, and Hao contributions in this volume).\n3.\n\nX-ray Properties of Double-Peaked Emitters\n\nStrateva et al. (2006) [S06] studied the X-ray emission of 39 double-peaked emitters, serendipitously detected in ROSAT (22/39), Chandra and XMM-Newton\nobservations. As a class the double-peaked emitters showed similar UV/opticalto-X-ray ratios (\u03b1ox = 0.3838 log[F2 keV /F2500 \u00c5 ]) and X-ray power-law spectral\nindices to other broad-line AGN. In practically all cases (see Fig. 3b) a comparison of the H\u03b1 emission strength with the viscous power available locally\n1\n\nThe outer emission radii are often poorly constrained due to a degeneracy between the disk\nouter radius and the power-law slope of the illuminating radiation.\n\n\fDouble-peaked emitters\n\n3\n\nfrom the accretion disk supports the need for external illumination of the disk\nto produce lines of the observed strength.\n\n4.\n\nNew Chandra and Swift Observations\n\nOur Chandra(5/16)/Swift(11/16) sample consists of the 16 double-peaked emitters with the broadest Balmer lines (FWHMH\u03b1 > 15, 000 km s\u22121 ) ever observed.\nThe Balmer-line emission in these AGN originates from the immediate vicinity\nof the black hole, immediately adjacent to the region responsible for the X-ray\nemission and the external illumination. Fig. 1 shows the optical and X-ray spectra of two radio-quiet [RQ] double-peaked emitters. Despite their comparable\n4200\u00c5 luminosities their X-ray spectra are strikingly different \u2013 with large cold\nabsorption modifying the power-law emission in one case, but not in the other\n(5\u00d71020 cm\u22122 and 1023 cm\u22122 for the top and bottom spectra, respectively). Half\nof the Chandra/Swift sample objects show intrinsic X-ray absorption.\n\nFigure 2. Left: The 2500\u00c5 vs. 2 keV monochromatic luminosities of the\nChandra/Swift targets (circles), the double-peaked emitters from S06 (triangles and squares), and the general SDSS AGN population (small dots). The\nopen symbols denote RL AGN, the solid symbols RQ AGN, and the arrows\nupper limits. Right: The \u03b1ox residual distributions for the RQ double-peaked\nemitters (top), the general SDSS lower-luminosity population (middle) and\nthe RL double-peaked emitters (bottom). The solid histograms in the top\nand bottom panels show only the Chandra/Swift samples, while the open\nhistogram indicates X-ray limits.\n\nThe X-ray power-law spectral indices of extremely broad double-peaked\nemitters are similar to those of other double-peaked emitters and normal AGN\nwith comparable radio-loudness. Unlike the general sample of double-peaked\nemitters, however, the broadest Balmer-line double-peaked emitters appear X-ray\nbrighter relative to other AGN with comparable UV emission (see Fig. 2). In\n\n\f4\n\nStrateva et al.\n\nFigure 3.\nLeft: The intrinsic X-ray absorption (arrows indicate limits based\non the Galactic absorption) vs. the Hydrogen column inferred from the NLR\nBalmer decrement; the dashed line is a line of equality. Right: The distribution of the ratio of line-strength (LH\u03b1 ) and locally available viscous power\n(Wdisk ) for the Chandra/Swift targets (solid histogram) and the E03 and S06\nobjects (hatched). A ratio larger than 10% (solid line) indicates the need for\nexternal illumination.\n\nFig. 2b we quantify this difference by comparing the \u03b1ox residual distributions2\nfor RQ and radio-loud [RL] double-peaked emitters to those of normal SDSS\nAGN with comparable luminosities. RL AGN are brighter in the X-rays than\nsimilar UV luminosity RQ AGN regardless of their Balmer-line shapes (i.e. they\nhave larger \u03b1ox residuals). After the addition of the broadest Balmer-line doublepeaked emitters to the objects in S06, we now find a statistically significant difference (99%) for the RQ double-peaked emitters, which are also X-ray brighter.\nFig. 3a shows the X-ray absorbing-gas column vs. the hydrogen column\nestimated based on the optical reddening (via the narrow line region [NLR]\nBalmer-line decrements). In a handful of double-peaked emitters (those close to\nthe dashed line in Fig. 3a) the observations are consistent with a single absorber\nwith gas-to-dust ratio similar to that of the interstellar medium in our Galaxy\n(e.g. the AGN host galaxy). In at least 3 cases the X-ray absorbing column is\nmuch higher, possibly indicating a dust-free or a partial absorber on scales much\nsmaller than the NLR.\nReferences\nCollin, S., Kawaguchi, T., Peterson, B.
