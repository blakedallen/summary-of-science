Recall that a contact form on Y is a 1-form \u03bb on\nY with \u03bb \u2227 d\u03bb > 0 everywhere. The contact form \u03bb determines a contact\nstructure, namely the oriented 2-plane field \u03be = Ker(\u03bb). It also determines\nthe Reeb vector field R characterized by d\u03bb(R, *) = 0 and \u03bb(R) = 1. A\nLegendrian knot in (Y, \u03bb) is a smooth knot K \u2282 Y such that T K \u2282 \u03be|K . A\nReeb chord of K is a trajectory of the Reeb vector field starting and ending\non K, i.e. a path \u03b3 : [0, T ] \u2192 Y for some T > 0 such that \u03b3 \u2032 (t) = R(\u03b3(t))\nand \u03b3(0), \u03b3(T ) \u2208 K. The main result of this paper is:\nTheorem 1.1. Let Y be a closed oriented 3-manifold with a contact form\n\u03bb. Then every Legendrian knot in (Y, \u03bb) has a Reeb chord.\nThis is a version of a conjecture of Arnold [2]. For the 3-sphere with any\ncontact form inducing the standard contact structure, and more generally\nfor boundaries of subcritical Stein manifolds in any odd dimension, this was\nproved by Mohnke [11]. This was also proved by Abbas [1] for Legendrian\nunknots in tight contact 3-manifolds satisfying certain assumptions.\nThe proof of Theorem 1.1 given here uses the relationship between embedded contact homology and Seiberg-Witten Floer cohomology. We now\nrecall the relevant parts of this correspondence.\n1\n\n\f1.2\n\nEmbedded contact homology\n\nWe begin by briefly reviewing the definition of embedded contact homology.\nFor more details see [6] and the references therein.\nLet Y be a closed oriented 3-manifold with a contact form \u03bb. A Reeb orbit\nis a closed orbit of the Reeb vector field, i.e. a map \u03b3 : R/T Z \u2192 Y for some\nT > 0 with \u03b3 \u2032 (t) = R(\u03b3(t)), modulo reparametrization. The linearized Reeb\nflow along a Reeb orbit \u03b3 defines an endomorphism P\u03b3 of the 2-dimensional\nsymplectic vector space (\u03be\u03b3(0) , d\u03bb). A Reeb orbit \u03b3 is nondegenerate if P\u03b3\ndoes not have 1 as an eigenvalue. In this case either P\u03b3 has real eigenvalues,\nin which case we say that \u03b3 is hyperbolic, or P\u03b3 has eigenvalues on the unit\ncircle, in which case \u03b3 is called elliptic. These notions do not depend on the\nparametrization of \u03b3. We say that the contact form \u03bb is nondegenerate if all\nits Reeb orbits are nondegenerate. A generic contact form has this property.\nAssume now that the contact form \u03bb on Y is nondegenerate. An orbit set\nis a finite set of pairs \u0398 = {(\u0398i , mi )} where the \u0398i 's are distinct embedded\nReeb orbits, and the mi 's are positive integers which one can think of as\n\"multiplicities\". The homology class of the orbit set \u0398 is defined by\nX\n[\u0398] :=\nmi [\u0398i ] \u2208 H1 (Y ).\ni\n\nThe orbit set \u0398 = {(\u0398i , mi )} is called admissible if mi = 1 whenever \u0398i is\nhyperbolic. An admissible orbit set is also called an ECH generator .\nIf \u0393 \u2208 H1 (Y ), then the embedded contact homology ECH\u2217 (Y, \u03bb, \u0393) is the\nhomology of a chain complex which is freely generated over Z/2 by admissible\norbit sets \u0398 with [\u0398] = \u0393.\nConvention. Although ECH is ordinarily defined over Z, with the signs\nspecified in [9, \u00a79], in this paper ECH is always defined with Z/2 coefficients,\nbecause this is sufficient for the applications here and will allow us to avoid\norientation headaches.\nTo define the chain complex differential one chooses a generic almost\ncomplex structure J on R \u00d7 Y of the following type:\nDefinition 1.2. An almost complex structure J on R\u00d7Y is symplectizationadmissible if J is R-invariant, J(\u2202s ) = R where s denotes the R coordinate,\nand J sends \u03be to itself, rotating \u03be positively with respect to the orientation\non \u03be given by d\u03bb.\nThe reason for the terminology is that the noncompact symplectic manifold (R \u00d7 Y, d(es \u03bb)) is called the symplectization of (Y, \u03bb).\nGiven a symplectization-admissible J, we now consider (not necessarily\nembedded) J-holomorphic curves in R \u00d7 Y whose domains are (not necessarily connected) punctured compact Riemann surfaces. A positive end of\n2\n\n\fsuch a holomorphic curve at a (not necessarily embedded) Reeb orbit \u03b3 is an\nend which is asymptotic to the cylinder R \u00d7 \u03b3 as the R coordinate s \u2192 +\u221e.\nA negative end is defined analogously with s \u2192 \u2212\u221e.\nDefinition 1.3. Given a symplectization-admissible J, and given (not necessarily admissible) orbit sets \u0398 = {(\u0398i , mi )} and \u0398\u2032 = {(\u0398\u2032j , m\u2032j )}, a \"Jholomorphic curve from \u0398 to \u0398\u2032 \" is a J-holomorphic curve in R\u00d7Y as above\nwith positive ends at covers of \u0398i with total multiplicity mi , negative ends\nat covers of \u0398\u2032j with total multiplicity m\u2032j , and no other ends.\nSuch a holomorphic curve may be multiply covered, but we are only\ninterested in the corresponding current. In particular, let MJ (\u0398, \u0398\u2032 ) denote\nthe moduli space of J-holomorphic curves from \u0398 to \u0398\u2032 , where two such\ncurves are considered equivalent if they represent the same current in R \u00d7 Y ,\nup to translation of the R coordinate.\nGiven ECH generators \u0398 and \u0398\u2032 with [\u0398] = [\u0398\u2032 ] = \u0393, the differential\ncoefficient h\u2202\u0398, \u0398\u2032 i \u2208 Z/2 is the mod 2 count of J-holomorphic curves in\nMJ (\u0398, \u0398\u2032 ) with \"ECH index\" equal to 1. The definition of the ECH index\nis not needed in this paper and may be found in [5]. If J is generic, then \u2202 is\nwell-defined and \u2202 2 = 0, as shown in [8, \u00a77]. In this case we denote the chain\ncomplex by ECC\u2217 (Y, \u03bb, \u0393; J). A symplectization-admissible almost complex\nstructure that is generic in this sense will be called ECH-generic here. It\nturns out that the curves counted by the ECH differential are embedded,\nexcept that they may include multiple covers of R-invariant cylinders. The\nECH index defines a relative Z/d(c1 (\u03be) + 2 PD(\u0393)) grading on the chain\ncomplex, where d denotes divisibility in H 2 (Y ; Z)/ Torsion.\n\n1.3\n\nThe isomorphism with Seiberg-Witten Floer cohomology\n\nAlthough the ECH differential depends on the choice of J, the homology\nof the chain complex does not. This follows from a much stronger theorem\nof the second author [15, 16, 17, 18] asserting that ECH is isomorphic to\na version of Seiberg-Witten Floer cohomology as defined by KronheimerMrowka. To be precise, there are three basic versions of Seiberg-Witten\nd \u2217 , HM\n\u02c7 \u2217 , and HM \u2217 . The first of these is\nFloer cohomology, denoted by HM\nd \u2217 (Y, s) to each\nthe one that is relevant to ECH; it assigns Z/2-modules HM\nspin-c structure s on Y , which have a relative Z/d(c1 (s))-grading.\nConvention 1.4. In this paper, all Seiberg-Witten Floer cohomology is\ndefined with Z/2 coefficients (even though it can be defined over Z, which\nis the default coefficient system in [12]).\nRecall that the set Spinc (Y ) of spin-c structures on Y is an affine space\nover H 2 (Y ; Z), and the contact structure \u03be determines a distinguished spin-c\n3\n\n\fstructure s\u03be . With this convention, the theorem is now that\nd \u2212\u2217 (Y, s\u03be + PD(\u0393)),\nECH\u2217 (Y, \u03bb, \u0393) \u2243 HM\n\n(1.1)\n\nas relatively graded Z/2-modules. (There is also an isomorphism with Z\ncoefficients [17].)\nIt follows from scrutiny of the proof of (1.1), together with the invarid \u2217 , that the versions of ECH\u2217 (Y, \u03bb, \u0393) defined using\nance properties of HM\ndifferent almost complex structures J are canonically isomorphic to each\nother. This point is explained in detail in [10]. Thus it makes sense to talk\nabout ECH\u2217 (Y, \u03bb, \u0393) without referring to a choice of J. Moreover, under\nthis identification, the isomorphism (1.1) is canonical.\nAt times it is convenient to ignore the homology class \u0393 in the definition\nof ECH, and simply define\nM\nECH\u2217 (Y, \u03bb) :=\nECH\u2217 (Y, \u03bb, \u0393).\n\u0393\u2208H1 (Y )\n\nThis is the homology of a chain complex ECC\u2217 (Y, \u03bb; J) generated by all\nadmissible orbit sets, and by (1.1) this homology is canonically isomorphic\n(as a relatively graded Z/2-module) to\nd \u2212\u2217 (Y ) :=\nHM\n\nM\n\ns\u2208Spinc (Y )\n\nd \u2212\u2217 (Y, s).\nHM\n\nThe proof of Theorem 1.1 makes use of two additional structures on\nECH: the action filtration and cobordism maps. We now explain these.\n\n1.4\n\nThe action filtration\n\nIf \u0398 = {(\u0398i , mi )} is an orbit set, its symplectic action or length is defined\nby\nZ\nX\n\u03b3.\n(1.2)\nA(\u0398) :=\nmi\ni\n\n\u0398i\n\nThe ECH differential for any (generic) symplectization-admissible J decreases the action, i.e. if h\u2202\u0398, \u0398\u2032 i 6= 0 then A(\u0398) \u2265 A(\u0398\u2032 ). This is because\nif C \u2208 MJ (\u0398, \u0398\u2032 ), then d\u03bb|C \u2265 0 everywhere1 . Thus for any real number\nL, it makes sense to define the filtered ECH , denoted by ECH\u2217L (Y, \u03bb), to be\nthe homology of the subcomplex ECC\u2217L (Y, \u03bb; J) of the ECH chain complex\nspanned by ECH generators with action less than L. It is shown in [10]\n1\n\nIn fact if h\u2202\u0398, \u0398\u2032 i 6= 0 then the strict inequality A(\u0398) > A(\u0398\u2032 ) holds, because d\u03bb\nvanishes identically on C if and only if the image of C is R-invariant, in which case C has\nECH index zero and cannot contribute to the differential.\n\n4\n\n\fthat ECH\u2217L (Y, \u03bb), just like ECH\u2217 (Y, \u03bb), does not depend on the choice of\nECH-generic J. However ECH\u2217L (Y, \u03bb), unlike the usual ECH, can change\nwhen one deforms the contact form \u03bb.\nFor L < L\u2032 there is a map\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u0131L,L : ECH\u2217L (Y, \u03bb) \u2212\u2192 ECH\u2217L (Y, \u03bb)\n\n(1.3)\n\ninduced by the inclusion of chain complexes (for some given J, although it is\nshown in [10] that (1.3) does not depend on J). The usual ECH is recovered\nas the direct limit\nECH\u2217 (Y, \u03bb) = lim ECH\u2217L (Y, \u03bb).\nL\u2192\u221e\n\n(1.4)\n\nIn particular, there is a natural map\n\u0131L : ECH\u2217L (Y, \u03bb) \u2212\u2192 ECH\u2217 (Y, \u03bb),\n\n(1.5)\n\nagain induced by an inclusion of chain complexes.\n\n1.5\n\nCobordism maps in ECH\n\nLet (Y+ , \u03bb+ ) and (Y\u2212 , \u03bb\u2212 ) be closed oriented 3-manifolds with nondegenerate\ncontact forms. An exact symplectic cobordism from (Y+ , \u03bb+ ) to (Y\u2212 , \u03bb\u2212 ) is\na compact symplectic 4-manifold (X, \u03c9) with boundary \u2202X = Y+ \u2212 Y\u2212 , for\nwhich there exists a 1-form \u03bb on X such that d\u03bb = \u03c9 on X and \u03bb|Y\u00b1 =\n\u03bb\u00b1 . A 1-form \u03bb as above is called a Liouville form for (X, \u03c9). When we\nwish to specify a Liouville form (which we usually do), we denote the exact\nsymplectic cobordism by (X, \u03bb), and we continue to write \u03c9 = d\u03bb.\nNote that our designation of the cobordism as \"from Y+ to Y\u2212 \" is natural from the perspective of symplectic geometry, but opposite from the\nusual convention in Seiberg-Witten and Heegaard Floer homology. This is\nconnected with the fact that embedded contact homology is identified with\nSeiberg-Witten Floer cohomology.\nNow let (X, \u03bb) be an exact symplectic cobordism as above. This cobordism, like any smooth cobordism, induces a map2 of ungraded Z/2-modules\n2\n\nKronheimer-Mrowka define this map on the \"completed\" Seiberg-Witten Floer cohod \u2022 . However for HM\nd , the completed and uncompleted cohomologies are the\nmology HM\n\u02c7 \u2217 and HM \u2217 of\nsame. Completion only makes a difference for the alternate versions HM\nSeiberg-Witten Floer cohomology.\nNote also that if one uses coefficients in Z instead of Z/2, then the signs in the cobordism\nd depend on a choice of \"homology orientation\" of X. However one expects\nmap on HM\nto be able to define cobordism maps on ECH over Z without making such a choice, cf.\n[14, Lem. A.14]. Presumably an exact symplectic cobordism has a canonical homology\norientation which makes the signs agree.\n\n5\n\n\ffrom the Seiberg-Witten Floer cohomology of Y+ to that of Y\u2212 , which we\ndenote by\nd \u2217 (X) : HM\nd \u2217 (Y+ ) \u2212\u2192 HM\nd \u2217 (Y\u2212 ).\nHM\n(1.6)\n\nDefinition 1.5. Define\n\n\u03a6(X) : ECH\u2217 (Y+ , \u03bb+ ) \u2212\u2192 ECH\u2217 (Y\u2212 , \u03bb\u2212 )\n\n(1.7)\n\nto be the map on ECH obtained by composing the map (1.6) on SeibergWitten Floer cohomology with the canonical isomorphism (1.1) on both\nsides.\nIt is natural to expect that the map (1.7) can be defined directly, without\nusing Seiberg-Witten theory, by suitably counting holomorphic curves in the\n\"completion\" of (X, \u03bb). The latter is a noncompact symplectic manifold\ndefined as follows. To start, one can find \u03b5 > 0, a neighborhood N\u2212 of Y\u2212\nin X, and an identification N\u2212 \u2243 [0, \u03b5) \u00d7 Y\u2212 , such that \u03bb = es \u03bb\u2212 on N\u2212 ,\nwhere s denotes the [0, \u03b5) coordinate. The requisite map [0, \u03b5) \u00d7 Y\u2212 \u2192 X is\nobtained using the flow starting at Y\u2212 of the unique vector field V on X such\nthat \u0131V \u03c9 = \u03bb. Likewise, a neighborhood N+ of Y+ in X can be identified\nwith (\u2212\u03b5, 0] \u00d7 Y+ so that \u03bb = es \u03bb+ on N+ . Using these identifications, one\ncan then glue symplectization ends to X to obtain the completion\nX := ((\u2212\u221e, 0] \u00d7 Y\u2212 ) \u222aY\u2212 X \u222aY+ ([0, \u221e) \u00d7 Y+ ).\n\n(1.8)\n\nNote for reference later that the Liouville form \u03bb on X canonically extends\nto a 1-form on X which equals es \u03bb\u00b1 on the ends.\nDefinition 1.6. An almost complex structure J on X is cobordism-admissible\nif it is \u03c9-compatible3 on X, and if it agrees with symplectization-admissible\nalmost complex structures J+ for \u03bb+ on [0, \u221e) \u00d7 Y+ and J\u2212 for \u03bb\u2212 on\n(\u2212\u221e, 0] \u00d7 Y\u2212 .\nGiven a cobordism-admissible J, and given (not necessarily admissible)\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\norbit sets \u0398+ = {(\u0398+\ni , mi )} in Y+ and \u0398 = {(\u0398j , mi )} in Y\u2212 , we define a\n\"J-holomorphic curve in X from \u0398+ to \u0398\u2212 \" analogously to Definition 1.3,\nand denote the moduli space of such curves by MJ (\u0398+ , \u0398\u2212 ), where two such\ncurves are considered equivalent if they represent the same current in X.\nOne would now like to define the map (1.7) by choosing a generic cobordismadmissible J and suitably counting J-holomorphic curves in X as above with\nECH index 0, so as to define a chain map between the ECH chain complexes\n3\nEverything we describe below should still be possible if one weakens the \u03c9-compatible\ncondition here to \u03c9-tame. However, because the papers relating Seiberg-Witten Floer\ncohomology to ECH use compatible almost complex structures, we will stick with the\nlatter to avoid confusion.\n\n6\n\n\fwhich induces the map (1.7) on homology. (In general one also needs to\ninclude contributions from \"broken\" J-holomorphic curves, see \u00a72.) An important consequence of such a construction would be that the map (1.7)\nrespects the action filtrations, i.e. is induced by a chain map which does not\nincrease the action filtration. The reason is that if C is any holomorphic\ncurve in MJ (\u0398+ , \u0398\u2212 ), then by Stokes' theorem and the exactness of the\ncobordism we have\nZ\nZ\nZ\n+\n\u2212\nd\u03bb\u2212 , (1.9)\n\u03c9+\nd\u03bb+ +\nA(\u0398 ) \u2212 A(\u0398 ) =\nC\u2229X\n\nC\u2229[0,\u221e)\u00d7Y+\n\nC\u2229(\u2212\u221e,0]\u00d7Y\u2212\n\nand all of the integrands on the right hand side are pointwise nonnegative\nby our assumptions on J.\nUnfortunately it is not currently known how to define the map (1.7) in\nterms of holomorphic curves as above. The difficulty is that, as explained\nin [5, \u00a75], the compactifications of the relevant moduli spaces of holomorphic curves can include broken curves with negative index multiply covered\ncomponents, and it is not clear in general what these should contribute to\nthe count (although examples show that such broken curves must sometimes\nmake nonzero contributions). However we can still use Seiberg-Witten theory to show that the map (1.7) respects the action filtrations (in a slightly\nweaker sense than above), and enjoys some other useful properties which\nwould follow from a definition in terms of holomorphic curves. The precise\nstatement uses filtered ECH and is given in Theorem 2.4 below.\nThe basic idea of the proof of Theorem 2.4 is to perturb the SeibergWitten equations on X using a large multiple of the symplectic form, much\nas in the proof of (1.1), and to show that with such a perturbation, SeibergWitten solutions that contribute to the cobordism map (1.7) give rise to\n(possibly broken) holomorphic curves. The main analytical machinery is\nadapted from the proof of (1.1) in [15, 18]. Nonetheless the detailed proof\nis still long, so we have deferred it to the sequel [10].\n\n1.6\n\nLegendrian surgery\n\nReturning finally to the chord conjecture, let (Y0 , \u03bb0 ) be a closed oriented\n3-manifold with a contact form, and let K be a Legendrian knot in (Y0 , \u03bb0 ).\nThe contact structure determines a framing of K, which we denote by tb(K).\nLet Y1 denote the 3-manifold obtained by surgery on K with framing tb(K)\u2212\n1. The surgery procedure determines a smooth cobordism X from Y1 to Y0 .\nAs was shown in [20] and as we review in \u00a73, the 3-manifold Y1 has a natural\ncontact structure, which can be expressed as the kernel of a contact form \u03bb1\nsuch that X has the structure of an exact symplectic cobordism from (Y1 , \u03bb1 )\nto (Y0 , \u03bb0 ). Moreover, as is familiar from the work of Bourgeois-Ekholm-\n\n7\n\n\fEliashberg [4] on Legendrian surgery in contact homology, the contact form\n\u03bb1 can be chosen so that, modulo \"long\" Reeb orbits, one has:\n(*) The Reeb orbits of \u03bb1 correspond to the Reeb orbits of \u03bb0 , together\nwith cyclic words in the Reeb chords of K.\nIn particular, if K has no Reeb chord, then \u03bb1 and \u03bb0 have the same \"short\"\nReeb orbits.\nThe idea of the proof of the chord conjecture is to use the preceding\nobservation, together with Theorem 2.4 regarding the properties of ECH\ncobordism maps, to show that if there is no Reeb chord then the ECH\ncobordism map\n\u03a6(X) : ECH\u2217 (Y1 , \u03bb1 ) \u2212\u2192 ECH\u2217 (Y0 , \u03bb0 )\n\n(1.10)\n\ninduced by the Legendrian surgery cobordism is an isomorphism. Note that\nthis is what one would expect by analogy with a very special case of the\naforementioned work of Bourgeois-Ekholm-Eliashberg.\nBut the map (1.10) cannot be an isomorphism, because this would contradict results of Kronheimer-Mrowka, namely:\nLemma 1.7. If Y1 is obtained from a closed oriented 3-manifold Y0 by\nsurgery along a knot K, and if X denotes the corresponding smooth cobordism\nfrom Y1 to Y0 , then the induced map on Seiberg-Witten Floer cohomology with\nZ/2 coefficients,\nd \u2217 (X) : HM\nd \u2217 (Y1 ) \u2212\u2192 HM\nd \u2217 (Y0 ),\nHM\n\n(1.11)\n\nis not an isomorphism.\n\nProof. It follows from [12, Thm. 42.2.1], see also [3, 13], that there is an\nexact triangle\nd\u2217\n\n(X)\nd \u2217 (Y2 ) \u2212\u2192 HM\nd \u2217 (Y1 ) HM\nd \u2217 (Y0 ) \u2212\u2192 HM\nd \u2217 (Y2 ) \u2212\u2192 * * *\n* * * \u2212\u2192 HM\n\u2212\u2192 HM\n\nwhere Y2 is obtained from Y0 by a certain different surgery along K. Note\nthat the exact triangle was only proved over Z/2, so it is fortunate that we\nare using Z/2 coefficients everywhere. Now the exact triangle implies that\nd \u2217 (Y2 ) would vanish. However the\nif (1.11) were an isomorphism, then HM\nlatter is nontrivial, because it follows from [12, Cor. 35.1.4] that for any 3manifold Y , if s is a torsion spin-c structure on Y (these always exist), then\nd \u2217 (Y, s) is infinitely generated. This is proved in [12] with Z coefficients,\nHM\nwhich immediately implies the statement with Z/2 coefficients.\n\n8\n\n\fThere are two wrinkles in the above argument. First, statement (*) is\ntrue only for Reeb orbits whose action is not too large, where the definition\nof \"large\" depends on the details of the Legendrian surgery construction.\nHowever one can modify \u03bb1 so as to make the corresponding upper bound\non the action arbitrary large, see Lemma 3.2 below. Moreover the different\nversions of (Y1 , \u03bb1 ) fit into a sequence of exact cobordisms. As a result, by\nmaking appropriate use of the cobordism maps on filtered ECH, we can still\nshow that if there is no Reeb chord then the ECH cobordism map (1.10)\ninduced by the Legendrian surgery is an isomorphism.\nSecond, the above argument only makes sense if the contact form \u03bb0\n(and with it the contact form \u03bb1 ) is nondegenerate, so that its ECH chain\ncomplex is well-defined. A priori there could exist a degenerate contact form\nand a Legendrian knot with no Reeb chord, such that for any nondegenerate\nperturbation of the contact form the knot does have a Reeb chord. To deal\nwith this issue, we will show that when \u03bb0 is nondegenerate, there exists\na Reeb chord with an upper bound on its symplectic action, given by a\nquantitative measure of the failure of the cobordism map (1.10) to be an\nisomorphism. The precise statement is given in Theorem 4.4 below. The\naforementioned upper bound depends \"continuously\" on the contact form,\nas shown in Proposition 5.1. It then follows from a compactness argument\nthat the chord conjecture holds in the degenerate case as well.\nContents of the rest of the paper. In \u00a72 we give the precise statement\nof Theorem 2.4 on the existence and properties of maps on (filtered) ECH\ninduced by exact symplectic cobordisms. In \u00a73\u2013\u00a75 we use Theorem 2.4 as a\n\"black box\" to prove the chord conjecture. The formal proof of the chord\nconjecture is put together at the end of \u00a75. In the sequel [10] we use SeibergWitten theory to prove Theorem 2.4.\nAcknowledgments.

Below, let (X, \u03bb) be an exact symplectic cobordism from (Y+ , \u03bb+ ) to (Y\u2212 , \u03bb\u2212 ), and assume that the contact\nforms \u03bb\u00b1 are nondegenerate. Fix a cobordism-admissible almost complex\nstructure J on X which restricts to symplectization-admissible almost complex structures J+ on [0, \u221e)\u00d7Y+ and J\u2212 on (\u2212\u221e, 0]\u00d7Y\u2212 , as in Definition 1.6.\nBroken curves. Let \u0398+ and \u0398\u2212 be (not necessarily admissible) orbit sets\nin (Y+ , \u03bb+ ) and (Y\u2212 , \u03bb\u2212 ) respectively.\nDefinition 2.1. A broken J-holomorphic curve from \u0398+ to \u0398\u2212 is a collection of holomorphic curves {Ck }1\u2264k\u2264N , and (not necessarily admissible)\norbit sets \u0398k+ and \u0398k\u2212 for each k, such that there exists k0 \u2208 {1, . . . , N }\nsuch that:\n\u2022 \u0398k+ is an orbit set in (Y+ , \u03bb+ ) for each k \u2265 k0 ; \u0398k\u2212 is an orbit set in\n(Y\u2212 , \u03bb\u2212 ) for each k \u2264 k0 ; \u0398N + = \u0398+ ; \u03981\u2212 = \u0398\u2212 ; and \u0398k\u2212 = \u0398k\u22121,+\nfor each k > 1.\n\u2022 If k > k0 then Ck \u2208 MJ+ (\u0398k+ , \u0398k\u2212 ); Ck0 \u2208 MJ (\u0398k0 ,+ , \u0398k0 ,\u2212 ); and if\nk < k0 then Ck \u2208 MJ\u2212 (\u0398k+ , \u0398k\u2212 ).\n\u2022 If k 6= k0 then Ck is not R-invariant (as a current).\nLet MJ (\u0398+ , \u0398\u2212 ) denote the moduli space of broken J-holomorphic curves\nfrom \u0398+ to \u0398\u2212 as above.\nNote that MJ (\u0398+ , \u0398\u2212 ) is a subset of MJ (\u0398+ , \u0398\u2212 ) corresponding to\nbroken curves as above in which N = 1 (and it is perhaps a misnomer to\ncall such curves \"broken\").\nProduct cylinders. If the cobordism (X, \u03bb) and the almost complex\nstructure J on X are very special, then X may contain regions that look like\npieces of a symplectization, in the following sense:\nDefinition 2.2. A product region in X is the image of an embedding [s\u2212 , s+ ]\u00d7\nZ \u2192 X, where s\u2212 < s+ and Z is an open 3-manifold, such that:\n\u2022 {s\u00b1 } \u00d7 Z maps to Y\u00b1 , and (s\u2212 , s+ ) \u00d7 Z maps to the interior of X.\n\u2022 The pullback of the Liouville form \u03bb to [s\u2212 , s+ ] \u00d7 Z has the form es \u03bb0 ,\nwhere s denotes the [s\u2212 , s+ ] coordinate, and \u03bb0 is a contact form on\nZ.\n\u2022 The pullback of the almost complex structure J to [s\u2212 , s+ ] \u00d7 Z has the\nfollowing properties:\n\n10\n\n\f\u2013 The restriction of J to Ker(\u03bb0 ) is independent of s.\n\u2013 J(\u2202/\u2202s) = f (s)R0 , where f is a positive function of s and R0\ndenotes the Reeb vector field for \u03bb0 .\nGiven a product region as above, the embedded Reeb orbits of \u03bb\u00b1 in\n{s\u00b1 } \u00d7 Z are identified with the embedded Reeb orbits of \u03bb0 in Z. If \u03b3 is\nsuch a Reeb orbit, then we can form a J-holomorphic cylinder in X by taking\nthe union of [s\u2212 , s+ ] \u00d7 \u03b3 in [s\u2212 , s+ ] \u00d7 Z with (\u2212\u221e, 0] \u00d7 \u03b3 in (\u2212\u221e, 0] \u00d7 Y\u2212\nand [0, \u221e) \u00d7 \u03b3 in [0, \u221e) \u00d7 Y+ .\nDefinition 2.3. We call a J-holomorphic cylinder as above a product cylinder.\nComposition of cobordisms. If (X1 , \u03bb1 ) is an exact symplectic cobordism from (Y+ , \u03bb+ ) to (Y0 , \u03bb0 ), and if (X2 , \u03bb2 ) is an exact symplectic cobordism from (Y0 , \u03bb0 ) to (Y\u2212 , \u03bb\u2212 ), then we can compose them to obtain an\nexact symplectic cobordism (X2 \u25e6 X1 , \u03bb) from (Y+ , \u03bb+ ) to (Y\u2212 , \u03bb\u2212 ). Here\nX2 \u25e6 X1 is obtained by gluing X1 and X2 along Y0 analogously to (1.8), and\n\u03bb|Xi = \u03bbi for i = 1, 2.\nHomotopy of cobordisms. Two exact symplectic cobordisms (X, \u03c90 )\nand (X, \u03c91 ) from (Y+ , \u03bb+ ) to (Y\u2212 , \u03bb\u2212 ) with the same underlying four-manifold\nX are homotopic if there is a one-parameter family of symplectic forms\n{\u03c9t | t \u2208 [0, 1]} on X such that (X, \u03c9t ) is an exact symplectic cobordism\nfrom (Y+ , \u03bb+ ) to (Y\u2212 , \u03bb\u2212 ) for each t \u2208 [0, 1].\nScaling. If \u03bb is a nondegenerate contact form on Y , and if c is a positive\nconstant, then there is a canonical \"scaling\" isomorphism\n\u2243\n\ns : ECH\u2217L (Y, \u03bb) \u2212\u2192 ECH\u2217cL (Y, c\u03bb).\n\n(2.1)\n\nTo see this, observe that the chain complexes on both sides have the same\ngenerators. Moreover, an ECH-generic almost complex structure J for \u03bb\ninduces a symplectization-admissible almost complex structure J c for c\u03bb,\nsuch that J and J c agree when restricted to the contact planes \u03be. The selfdiffeomorphism of R \u00d7 Y sending (s, y) 7\u2192 (cs, y) then induces a bijection\nbetween J-holomorphic curves and J c -holomorphic curves. So with these\nchoices, the canonical identification of generators is an isomorphism of chain\ncomplexes. Moreover, it is shown in [10] that the resulting isomorphism\n(2.1) does not depend on J (under the canonical isomorphisms between the\nversions of ECH defined using different almost complex structures).\n\n11\n\n\fTheorem 2.4. Let (Y+ , \u03bb+ ) and (Y\u2212 , \u03bb\u2212 ) be closed oriented 3-manifolds\nwith nondegenerate contact forms. Let (X, \u03bb) be an exact symplectic cobordism from (Y+ , \u03bb+ ) to (Y\u2212 , \u03bb\u2212 ). Then there exist maps (of ungraded Z/2modules)\n\u03a6L (X, \u03bb) : ECH\u2217L (Y+ , \u03bb+ ) \u2212\u2192 ECH\u2217L (Y\u2212 , \u03bb\u2212 )\n(2.2)\nfor each real number L, such that:\n(Homotopy Invariance) The map \u03a6L (X, \u03bb) depends only on L and the homotopy class of (X, \u03c9).\n(Inclusion) If L < L\u2032 then the following diagram commutes:\n\u03a6L (X,\u03bb)\n\nECH\u2217L (Y+ , \u03bb+ ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 ECH\u2217L (Y\u2212 , \u03bb\u2212 )\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6 L,L\u2032\n\uf8e6 L,L\u2032\ny\u0131\ny\u0131\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03a6L (X,\u03bb)\n\n\u2032\n\nECH\u2217L (Y+ , \u03bb+ ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 ECH\u2217L (Y\u2212 , \u03bb\u2212 ).\n(Direct Limit)\nlim \u03a6L (X, \u03bb) = \u03a6(X) : ECH\u2217 (Y+ , \u03bb+ ) \u2212\u2192 ECH\u2217 (Y\u2212 , \u03bb\u2212 ),\n\nL\u2192\u221e\n\nwhere \u03a6(X) is as in Definition 1.5.\n(Composition) If (X, \u03bb) is the composition of (X2 , \u03bb2 ) and (X1 , \u03bb1 ) as above\nwith \u03bb0 nondegenerate, then\n\u03a6L (X2 \u25e6 X1 , \u03bb) = \u03a6L (X2 , \u03bb2 ) \u25e6 \u03a6L (X1 , \u03bb1 ).\n(Scaling) If c is a positive constant then the following diagram commutes:\nECH\u2217L (Y+ , \u03bb+ )\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6s\ny\n\n\u03a6L (X,\u03bb)\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\n\u03a6cL (X,c\u03bb)\n\nECH\u2217L (Y\u2212 , \u03bb\u2212 )\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6s\ny\n\nECH\u2217cL (Y+ , c\u03bb+ ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 ECH\u2217cL (Y\u2212 , c\u03bb\u2212 ).\n(Holomorphic Curves) Let J be a cobordism-admissible almost complex\nstructure on X such that J+ and J\u2212 are ECH-generic.

For any three-manifold with a nondegenerate contact form,\nthe empty set of Reeb orbits is a cycle in the ECH chain complex (whose\nhomology class in ECH corresponds to the \"contact invariant\" in SeibergWitten Floer cohomology, see [19]). If \u2205\u00b1 denotes the empty set of Reeb\norbits, regarded as a generator of the ECH chain complex for Y\u00b1 , then it\nfollows from the Holomorphic Curves axiom that\n\u03a6L (X, \u03bb) : [\u2205+ ] 7\u2212\u2192 [\u2205\u2212 ].\nThe reason is that for any cobordism-admissible almost complex structure J,\nby (1.9) there is a unique J-holomorphic curve with no positive end, namely\nthe empty holomorphic curve.\nRemark 2.6. Theorem 2.4 has applications beyond the chord conjecture,\nfor example to symplectic embedding obstructions [7]. The Scaling axiom is\nnot needed for the proof of the chord conjecture, but is useful in these other\napplications.\n\n3\n\nLegendrian surgery\n\nWe now explain the details of the Legendrian surgery construction we will\nuse. In particular we define a sequence of Legendrian surgeries, related to\neach other by exact symplectic cobordisms, in which the Reeb vector field is\nincreasingly well-behaved.\nTo begin, recall that a Liouville vector field on a symplectic manifold\n(X, \u03c9) is a vector field V such that LV \u03c9 = \u03c9. A Liouville vector field V is\nequivalent to a 1-form \u03bb such that d\u03bb = \u03c9, via the equation \u03bb = \u0131V \u03c9.\nIf Y is a hypersurface in (X, \u03c9) transverse to a Liouville vector field V ,\nthen \u03bbY := \u03bb|Y is a contact form on Y . Now let Y \u2032 be another hypersurface\ntransverse to V , and suppose that the time t flow of V defines a diffeomorphism \u03c6 : Y \u2192 Y \u2032 , where t is some function on Y . Then the contact forms\non Y and Y \u2032 are related by\n\u03c6\u2217 \u03bbY \u2032 = et \u03bbY .\n\n(3.1)\n\nWith the above preliminaries out of the way, consider now a closed oriented 3-manifold Y0 with a nondegenerate contact form \u03bb0 . Let K be a\nLegendrian knot in (Y0 , \u03bb0 ). Let Y1 be the 3-manifold obtained by surgery\nalong K with framing tb(K) \u2212 1.\n13\n\n\fProposition 3.1. There exist:\n\u2022 a nondegenerate contact form \u03bb1 on Y1 ,\n\u2022 an exact symplectic cobordism (X, \u03bb) from (Y1 , \u03bb1 ) to (Y0 , \u03bb0 ); let V\ndenote its associated associated Liouville vector field;\n\u2022 a compact hypersurface Y1/n in X transverse to V for each positive\ninteger n,\nT\n\u2022 and neighborhoods U1/n of K in Y0 with U1/n \u2283 U1/(n+1) and \u221e\nn=1 U1/n =\nK,\nwith the following properties:\n(a) The induced contact form \u03bb1/n on Y1/n is nondegenerate.\n\u2243\n\n(b) The negative time flow of V induces a diffeomorphism Y1/n \u2192 Y1/(n+1) .\n(The flow time varies over Y1/n .)\n(c) The time \u22121/n flow of V , call it \u03c6\u22121/n , is defined on all of Y1/n . There\ne1/n of Y1/n such that\nis a subset U\ne1/n ) = Y0 \\ U1/n .\n\u03c6\u22121/n (Y1/n \\ U\n\n(d) The Reeb vector field on (Y1/n , \u03bb1/n ) has no closed orbits contained\ne1/n .\nentirely within U\n\nProof. The idea for building the cobordism (X, \u03bb) is to start with the exact\nsymplectic cobordism ([0, 1]\u00d7Y0 , es \u03bb0 ), where s denotes the [0, 1] coordinate.\nOne then attaches a 2-handle with an appropriate Liouville form to {1} \u00d7 Y0\nin a neighborhood of {1} \u00d7 K. We proceed in four steps.\nStep 1. We first describe a model for the handle attachment, following\n[20]. PConsider R4 with coordinates q1 , q2 , p1 , p2 and the symplectic form\n\u03c9 = 2i=1 dpi dqi . Define a Liouville vector field on R4 by\nV =\n\n2 \u0012\nX\ni=1\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+ 2qi\n\u2212pi\n\u2202pi\n\u2202qi\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\nConsider the hypersurface\nY = (p21 + p22 = 1) \u2282 R4 ,\nregarded as the boundary of (p21 + p22 \u2265 1). The Liouville vector field V is\ntransverse to Y and so induces a contact form on Y . With respect to this\ncontact form, the circle\nC = (q1 = q2 = 0, p21 + p22 = 1)\n14\n\n\fis a Legendrian knot. To the region (p21 +p22 \u2265 1) we now attach the 2-handle\nconsisting of the subset of R4 where\np21 + p22 \u2264 1,\n\nq12 + q22 \u2264 \u03b5\n\nfor some \u03b5 > 0. The boundary of the region with the 2-handle attached\nhas a corner where p21 + p22 = 1 and q12 + q22 = \u03b5. To round the corner, we\nreplace the boundary hypersurface q12 + q22 = \u03b5 of the handle with a nearby\nhypersurface, staying within the region \u03b5/2 < q12 + q22 \u2264 \u03b5, and defined by\nan equation of the form\nf (q12 + q22 , p21 + p22 ) = 0,\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere at each point on the zero set of f we have \u2202f /\u2202x > 0 and \u2202f /\u2202y \u2264 0.\nThe boundary of the region with the 2-handle attached is then a smooth\nhypersurface Y \u2032 which is transverse to the Liouville vector field V .\nStep 2. We now pass from the model case to the case of interest. By [20,\nProp. 4.2], there is a diffeomorphism of a neighborhood N of C in R4 with\na neighborhood of {1} \u00d7 K in the symplectization R \u00d7 Y0 , which respects\nthe symplectic forms and Liouville vector fields and locally identifies the\nhypersurface Y in R4 with the hypersurface {1} \u00d7 Y0 in R \u00d7 Y0 . If \u03b5 > 0\nis sufficiently small, then N \u2229 Y will contain the region in Y to which the\n2-handle in R4 is attached. We then use the above diffeomorphism to attach\nthe 2-handle described above in R4 , with its symplectic form and Liouville\nvector field, to [0, 1] \u00d7 Y0 . We now provisionally define X to be the resulting\nexact symplectic cobordism, and (Y1 , \u03bb1 ) to be its positive boundary with the\ninduced contact form. It is not hard to check that as a smooth 3-manifold,\nY1 is obtained from Y0 by surgery on K with framing tb(K) \u2212 1. We also\ne1 to be the part of Y1 in the handle, and U1 = Y0 \\ \u03c6\u22121 (Y1 \\ U\ne1 ).\ndefine U\nThat is, U1 \u2282 Y0 corresponds to the subset of {1} \u00d7 Y0 to which the handle\nis attached.\nStep 3. We now check that the Reeb vector field R1 on Y1 has the required\ne1 . On\nproperties. We first show that R1 has no closed orbit contained in U\n4\ne1 , in terms of the coordinates on R , the Reeb vector field R1 is parallel to\nU\nthe Hamiltonian vector field associated to the function (3.2). Thus\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202f\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202f\n+ q2\n+ p2\n\u2212\n,\nq1\np1\ngR1 =\n\u2202x\n\u2202p1\n\u2202p2\n\u2202y\n\u2202q1\n\u2202q2\ne1 . Now define another function h on\nwhere g is some positive function on U\ne1 by\nU\nh := p1 q1 + p2 q2 .\nWe then compute that\nR1 (h) > 0\n15\n\n(3.3)\n\n\fe1 . It follows immediately that R1 has no closed orbit contained\non all of U\ne\nin U1 .\nNext we consider nondegeneracy of \u03bb1 . By construction, \u03bb1 is a constant\ne1 . Since \u03bb0 was assumed nondegenerate, it follows\nmultiple of \u03bb0 outside of U\ne1 is nondegenerate as well.\nthat any Reeb orbit for \u03bb1 that avoids the region U\nConsequently we can make \u03bb1 nondegenerate by perturbing it (specifically,\ne1 . By equation (3.1),\nmultiplying it by a positive function close to 1) in U\ne1\nsuch a perturbation of \u03bb1 can be effected by perturbing the hypersurface U\n1\nin the definition of X. If this perturbation is sufficiently C -small, then (3.3)\nwill still hold, so the Reeb vector field of \u03bb1 will now have all of the required\nproperties.\nStep 4. The hypersurface Y1/n \u2282 X is now defined to be the positive\nboundary of the region obtained by starting with [0, 1/n] \u00d7 Y0 and attaching\na taller and thinner 2-handle. This handle is obtained by starting with the\nsubset of R4 where\np21 + p22 \u2264 e2(1\u22121/n) ,\n\nq12 + q12 \u2264 21\u2212n \u03b5,\n\nthen rounding corners as before and perturbing if necessary to make \u03bb1/n\ne1/n to be the part of Y1/n in the handle,\nnondegenerate. Finally, one defines U\ne1 ).\nand U1/n = Y0 \\ \u03c6\u22121/n (Y1 \\ U\nA basic consequence of the above construction is the following:\n\nLemma 3.2. Suppose K has no Reeb chord with action \u2264 L. Then for all\nn sufficiently large:\ne1/n .\n(a) The Reeb orbits of \u03bb1/n with action < e1/n L avoid the region U\n\n(b) \u03c6\u22121/n defines a bijection from the Reeb orbits of \u03bb1/n with action <\ne1/n L to the Reeb orbits of \u03bb0 with action < L.\n\nProof. Suppose {nk }k=1,2,... is an increasing sequence of positive integers\nand that for each k there exists a Reeb orbit \u03b3k for \u03bb1/nk of action < e1/nk L\ne1/n . Then for each k, the set \u03c6\u22121/n (\u03b3k \u2229 (Y1/n \\ U\ne1/n )) is\nintersecting U\nk\nk\nk\nk\na union of Reeb trajectories of \u03bb0 starting and ending on the boundary of\nU1/nk with total action less than L. Picking one of these trajectories for\neach k, we can pass to a subsequence so that these trajectories converge to\na Reeb chord with action \u2264 L. This proves (a). Similarly, if n is sufficiently\nlarge then the Reeb orbits of \u03bb0 with action < L avoid the region U1/n . This\ntogether with (a) implies (b).\n\n16\n\n\f4\n\nThe chord conjecture: nondegenerate case\n\nWe now prove the chord conjecture, Theorem 1.1, in the case when the\ncontact form \u03bb0 is nondegenerate. Below, we use the notation from the\nLegendrian surgery construction in Proposition 3.1. Also, to shorten the\nnotation we write H\u2217 (Y, \u03bb) to denote ECH\u2217 (Y, \u03bb), and H\u2217L (Y, \u03bb) to denote\nECH\u2217L (Y, \u03bb).\nObserve that by the construction in \u00a73, the exact symplectic cobordism\n(X, \u03bb) contains an exact symplectic cobordism from (Y1/n , \u03bb1/n ) to (Y0 , \u03bb0 ),\ncall this X1/n . The main lemma is now:\nLemma 4.1. Let L > 0. Suppose that K has no Reeb chord of action \u2264 L.\nThen for all n sufficiently large, the cobordism map\n\u03a6e\n\n1/n L\n\n(X1/n , \u03bb) : H\u2217e\n\n1/n L\n\n(Y1/n , \u03bb1/n ) \u2212\u2192 H\u2217e\n\n1/n L\n\n(Y0 , \u03bb0 )\n\n(4.1)\n\nis the composition of an isomorphism\nH\u2217e\n\n1/n L\n\n\u2243\n\n(Y1/n , \u03bb1/n ) \u2212\u2192 H\u2217L (Y0 , \u03bb0 )\n\nwith the inclusion-induced map \u0131L,e\n\n1/n L\n\n: H\u2217L (Y0 , \u03bb0 ) \u2192 H\u2217e\n\n(4.2)\n1/n L\n\n(Y0 , \u03bb0 ).\n\nProof. By Lemma 3.2, if n is sufficiently large, then the Reeb orbits for \u03bb1/n\nof action less than e1/n L correspond via \u03c6\u22121/n to the Reeb orbits for \u03bb0 of\naction less than L, and the latter stay outside of the neighborhood U1/n of\nK. Let n be so large.\nBy Proposition 3.1(c), the flow of the Liouville vector field V starting on\nY1/n for times in the interval [\u22121/n, 0] defines an embedding of [\u22121/n, 0] \u00d7\n0\nY1/n into X1/n . Let X1/n\ndenote the image of this embedding. We identify\n0\nX1/n with [0, 1/n] \u00d7 Y1/n such that Y1/n is identified with {1/n} \u00d7 Y1/n , and\nthe Liouville vector field V = \u2202/\u2202s, where s denotes the [0, 1/n] coordinate.\nThen {0} \u00d7 Y1/n defines a hypersurface in X1/n which includes Y0 \\ U1/n \u2282\n1\n\u2202X1/n , and which also passes into the interior of X1/n . Let X1/n\ndenote\n0 . We can now decompose the completed cobordism X\nX1/n \\ X1/n\n1/n as\n1\nX1/n = ((\u2212\u221e, 0] \u00d7 Y0 ) \u222a X1/n\n\u222a ([0, \u221e) \u00d7 Y1/n ),\n\n(4.3)\n\n0\nwhere X1/n\ncorresponds to [0, 1/n] \u00d7 Y1/n in (4.3).\nWe now choose a cobordism-admissible almost complex structure J on\nX1/n in four steps as follows. First, let J+ be an almost complex structure\non R \u00d7 Y1/n which is symplectization-admissible with respect to \u03bb1/n and\nECH-generic. Require J to agree with J+ on [1/n, \u221e) \u00d7 Y1/n . Second,\nextend J over [0, 1/n] \u00d7 Y1/n by setting J = J+ on Ker(\u03bb1/n ), and J(\u2202s ) =\n\n17\n\n\ff (s)R1/n , where R1/n denotes the Reeb vector field associated to \u03bb1/n , and\nf : [0, 1/n] \u2192 R is a positive function which equals 1 near s = 1/n and which\nequals e1/n near s = 0. Third, extend J over (\u2212\u221e, 0] \u00d7 Y0 so that it agrees\nwith an almost complex structure J\u2212 on R \u00d7 Y0 which is symplectizationadmissible for \u03bb0 and ECH-generic. Note that one can arrange for J\u2212 to\nbe ECH-generic without disturbing the previous choices because J+ is ECHgeneric. To complete the construction of J, choose an arbitrary \u03c9-compatible\n1 .\nextension of J over X1/n\ne1/n ) is a product region in the\nWith the above choices, [0, 1/n] \u00d7 (Y1/n \\ U\nsense of Definition 2.2. In particular, let \u0398 be an ECH generator for \u03bb1/n\nof action less than e1/n L. Since the Reeb orbits in \u0398 stay out of the region\ne1/n , there is a union of covers of product cylinders (see Definition 2.3) in\nU\nX1/n from \u0398 to \u03c6\u22121/n (\u0398).\nWe claim that if C is any other J-holomorphic curve in X1/n from the\nabove \u0398 to an ECH generator \u0398\u2032 for \u03bb0 , then\ne\u22121/n A(\u0398) > A(\u0398\u2032 ),\n\n(4.4)\n\nwhere A denotes the symplectic action. To prove (4.4), observe that the\nLiouville form \u03bb on X1/n agrees with es \u03bb0 on (\u2212\u221e, 0] \u00d7 Y0 and agrees with\nes\u22121/n \u03bb1/n on [0, \u221e) \u00d7 Y1/n in (4.3). Using Stokes' theorem, we obtain\nZ\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u22121/n\n\u2032\nd e\u22121/n \u03bb1/n\ne\nA(\u0398) \u2212 A(\u0398 ) =\nC\u2229([0,\u221e)\u00d7Y1/n )\n\n+\n+\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n1\nC\u2229X1/n\n\nd\u03bb\nd\u03bb0 .\n\nC\u2229((\u2212\u221e,0]\u00d7Y0 )\n\nThe first and third integrals on the right are pointwise nonnegative, and zero\nonly where C is tangent to \u2202s . The second integral on the right is pointwise\npositive. We conclude that e\u22121/n A(\u0398) \u2212 A(\u0398\u2032 ) \u2265 0, with equality if and\nonly if C is a union of covers of product cylinders.\n1/n\nConsider now the chain map \u03a6\u0302e L (X1/n , \u03bb) inducing (4.1) provided by\nthe Holomorphic Curves axiom in Theorem 2.4.

(a) Define A to be the infimum of the set of real numbers\nL such that the image of the inclusion-induced map\n\u0131L : H\u2217L (Y0 , \u03bb0 ) \u2212\u2192 H\u2217 (Y0 , \u03bb0 )\nis not contained in the image of the cobordism map (1.10).\n(b) Define B to be the infimum of the set of real numbers L such that the\nkernel of the cobordism map\n\u03a6L (X, \u03bb) : H\u2217L (Y1 , \u03bb1 ) \u2212\u2192 H\u2217L (Y0 , \u03bb0 )\nis not contained in the kernel of the inclusion-induced map\n\u0131L : H\u2217L (Y1 , \u03bb1 ) \u2212\u2192 H\u2217 (Y1 , \u03bb1 ).\nLemma 4.3. (a) If (1.10) is not surjective, then A < \u221e.\n(b) If (1.10) is not injective, then B < \u221e.\nProof. (a) If (1.10) is not surjective then there exists an element of H\u2217 (Y0 , \u03bb0 )\nwhich is not in the image; and by (1.4), any given element of H\u2217 (Y0 , \u03bb0 )\ncomes from H\u2217L (Y0 , \u03bb0 ) for some L.\n(b) If (1.10) is not injective, then there exists a nonzero element H\u2217 (Y1 , \u03bb1 )\nwhich maps to zero in H\u2217 (Y0 , \u03bb0 ). We can represent the former by a chain\n\u03b6 of action less than some L, and its image under the cobordism chain map\nis the boundary of a chain with action less than some L\u2032 . We may assume\nthat L\u2032 \u2265 L. It then follows from the Inclusion axiom in Theorem 2.4 that\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u0131L,L [\u03b6] is in the kernel of the cobordism map \u03a6L (X, \u03bb).

Thus B \u2264 L\u2032 .\nIn view of Lemma 1.7 and Definition 1.5, the chord conjecture in the\nnondegenerate case now follows from:\nTheorem 4.4. Let Y0 be a closed oriented 3-manifold with a nondegenerate\ncontact form \u03bb0 , and let K be a Legendrian knot in (Y0 , \u03bb0 ).\n(a) If (1.10) is not surjective, then K has a Reeb chord of action \u2264 A.\n(b) If (1.10) is not injective, then K has a Reeb chord of action \u2264 B.\n\n19\n\n\fProof. To prove part (a), it is enough to show that given L > 0, if there is\nno Reeb chord of action \u2264 L, then A \u2265 L.

In addition, the composition of\nthe lower two arrows is the cobordism map (1.10), by the Composition axiom\nd \u2217 ). The statement\nin Theorem 2.4 (or by the composition property for HM\nwe need to prove now follows by chasing the diagram.\nThe proof of part (b) is similar to the proof of part (a). It is enough\nto show that if there is no Reeb chord of action \u2264 L, then the kernel of\nthe cobordism map H\u2217L (Y1 , \u03bb1 ) \u2192 H\u2217L (Y0 , \u03bb0 ) is contained in the kernel of\nthe inclusion-induced map H\u2217L (Y1 , \u03bb1 ) \u2192 H\u2217 (Y1 , \u03bb1 ). To do so, let n be\nsufficiently large as in Lemma 4.1 (with L replaced by e\u22121/n L). Then by the\nInclusion and Direct Limit axioms in Theorem 2.4, we have a commutative\ndiagram\n\u03a6L (X\\X1/n , \u03bb)\n\n\u2243\n\nH\u2217L (Y1 , \u03bb1 ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 H\u2217L (Y1/n , \u03bb1/n ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 H\u2217e\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6L\n\uf8e6L\ny\u0131\ny\u0131\nH\u2217 (Y1 , \u03bb1 )\n\n\u2243\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nH\u2217 (Y1/n , \u03bb1/n )\n20\n\n\u22121/n L\n\n(Y0 , \u03bb0 )\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6 e\u22121/n L,L\ny\u0131\n\nH\u2217L (Y0 , \u03bb0 ),\n\n\fwhere the composition of the two rightmost arrows is \u03a6L (X1/n , \u03bb). By the\nComposition axiom in Theorem 2.4, the composition of the three arrows from\nH\u2217L (Y1 , \u03bb1 ) to H\u2217L (Y0 , \u03bb0 ) is \u03a6L (X, \u03bb). Now suppose \u03b6 \u2208 H\u2217L (Y1 , \u03bb1 ) maps to\n\u22121/n L\nzero in H\u2217L (Y0 , \u03bb0 ). Since the latter is the direct limit of H\u2217e\n(Y0 , \u03bb0 ) as\nn \u2192 \u221e, it follows that if n is chosen sufficiently large then \u03b6 maps to zero\n\u22121/n L\n(Y0 , \u03bb0 ). Chasing the diagram then shows that \u03b6 maps to zero in\nin H\u2217e\nH\u2217 (Y1 , \u03bb1 ), as required.\n\n5\n\nThe chord conjecture: degenerate case\n\nWe now use Theorem 4.4 for the nondegenerate case to deduce the chord\nconjecture when \u03bb0 is degenerate.\nWhen \u03bb0 is degenerate, one can repeat the surgery construction from \u00a73,\nto obtain an exact symplectic cobordism (X, \u03bb) as before, now with degenerate contact forms \u03bb1/n on the hypersurfaces Y1/n . However by (3.1) one can\nperturb these hypersurfaces slightly, as well as the boundary hypersurfaces\nY0 and Y1 , in the completion X, so as to make the induced contact forms on\nthem nondegenerate. In particular, for each positive integer k we can find\n(k)\n(k)\nfunctions f1/n on Y1/n and f0 on Y0 with\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\nkf1/n kC 1 , kf0 kC 1 < 1/k\nsuch that we have an exact cobordism X (k) as in \u00a73, contained in X with the\nsame Liouville form \u03bb (which we henceforth omit from the notation), with\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\nf1/n\n\nnondegenerate contact forms \u03bb1/n = e\nY0 . We can also assume that\n(1)\n\nf0\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(1)\n\n> f0 ,\n\n(k)\n\n\u03bb1/n on Y1/n and \u03bb0 = ef0 \u03bb0 on\n\nf1\n\n(k)\n\n> f1 ,\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhich will be convenient below.\nNow let A(k) and B(k) denote the upper bounds on the action of a\n(k)\n(k)\nReeb chord coming from the cobordism X (k) from (Y1 , \u03bb1 ) to (Y0 , \u03bb0 ).\nBy Theorem 4.4 and a compactness argument for Reeb chords explained at\nthe end of this section, to prove the chord conjecture for \u03bb0 it is enough to\nshow that A(k) and B(k) stay bounded as k \u2192 \u221e. In fact we have:\nProposition 5.1. A(k) \u2264 A(1) and B(k) \u2264 B(1).\n(k)\n\nProof. By the first part of (5.1), there is a subset X+ of X, diffeomorphic\n(1)\n\nto [0, 1] \u00d7 Y1 , which defines an exact symplectic cobordism from (Y1 , \u03bb1 )\n(k)\n(k)\nto (Y1 , \u03bb1 ). Likewise, by the second part of (5.1), there is a subset X\u2212\nof X, diffeomorphic to [0, 1] \u00d7 Y0 , which is an exact symplectic cobordism\n21\n\n\f(1)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\nfrom (Y0 , \u03bb0 ) to (Y0 , \u03bb0 ). Let X0 denote compact subset of X bounded\n(k)\n(k)\nby the negative boundary of X+ and the positive boundary of X\u2212 . This\n(k)\n\n(1)\n\nis an exact symplectic cobordism from (Y1 , \u03bb1 ) to (Y0 , \u03bb0 ), and we have\n(k)\n(k)\n(k)\n(k)\nthe compositions X0 \u25e6 X+ = X (1) and X\u2212 \u25e6 X0 = X (k) .\nNow fix L and consider the diagram\n(k)\n\n(1)\n\n\u03a6L (X+ )\n\n(1)\n\n\u03a6(X+ )\n\n(k)\n\n\u03a6L (X\n\n(k)\n\n\u03a6(X\n\n(k)\n\n)\n\n(k)\n\n(1)\n\n\u03a6L (X\u2212 )\n\n(1)\n\n\u03a6(X\u2212 )\n\n(k)\n\nH\u2217L (Y1 , \u03bb1 ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 H\u2217L (Y1 , \u03bb1 ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u22120\u2212\u2192 H\u2217L (Y0 , \u03bb0 ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 H\u2217L (Y0 , \u03bb0 )\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6L\n\uf8e6L\n\uf8e6L\n\uf8e6L\ny\u0131\ny\u0131\ny\u0131\ny\u0131\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\nH\u2217 (Y1 , \u03bb1 ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 H\u2217 (Y1 , \u03bb1 ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u22120\u2212\u2192 H\u2217 (Y0 , \u03bb0 ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 H\u2217 (Y0 , \u03bb0 ).\n\u2243\n\n\u2243\n\n(k)\n\nThis diagram commutes by the Inclusion axiom, and the maps \u03a6(X\u00b1 ) are\n(k)\n\nisomorphisms because the cobordisms X\u00b1 are diffeomorphic to products,\nwhich induce isomorphisms on Seiberg-Witten Floer cohomology. By the\nComposition axiom, the composition of the two upper left horizontal arrows\nis \u03a6L (X (1) ), the composition of the two upper right horizontal arrows is\n\u03a6L (X (k) ), the composition of the two lower left horizontal arrows is \u03a6(X (1) ),\nand the composition of the two lower right horizontal arrows is \u03a6(X (k) ).\nTo prove that A(k) \u2264 A(1), it is enough to show that if the image of\n(k)\n(k)\nL\n\u0131 : H\u2217L (Y0 , \u03bb0 ) \u2192 H\u2217 (Y0 , \u03bb0 ) is contained in the image of \u03a6(X (k) ), then\n(1)\n(1)\nthe image of \u0131L : H\u2217L (Y0 , \u03bb0 ) \u2192 H\u2217 (Y0 , \u03bb0 ) is contained in the image of\n\u03a6(X (1) ). This follows immediately by chasing the above diagram.\nTo prove that B(k) \u2264 B(1), it is enough to show that if the kernel of\n(k)\n(k)\nL\n\u03a6 (X (k) ) is contained in the kernel of \u0131L : H\u2217L (Y1 , \u03bb1 ) \u2192 H\u2217 (Y1 , \u03bb1 ), then\n(1)\nthe kernel of \u03a6L (X (1) ) is contained in the kernel of \u0131L : H\u2217L (Y1 , \u03bb1 ) \u2192\n(1)\nH\u2217 (Y1 , \u03bb1 ). This also follows immediately from the above diagram.\nTo conclude, we have:\nProof of Theorem 1.1. Let Y0 be a closed oriented 3-manifold with a contact\nform \u03bb0 , and let K be a Legendrian knot in (Y0 , \u03bb0 ).\nIf \u03bb0 is nondegenerate, then it follows from Lemma 1.7 and Definition 1.5\nthat the map (1.10) is not an isomorphism. Let A, B \u2208 [0, \u221e] be the numbers in Definition 4.2. By Lemma 4.3 we have min(A, B) < \u221e, and by\nTheorem 4.4 the knot K has a Reeb chord of length at most min(A, B).\n(k)\nIf \u03bb0 is degenerate, let {\u03bb0 }k=1,2,... be a sequence of nondegenerate\nperturbations of \u03bb0 as described at the beginning of this section, and let\nA(k), B(k) denote the corresponding quantities from Definition 4.2. By\n(k)\nthe nondegenerate case, K has a Reeb chord \u03b3k for \u03bb0 of length at most\n\n22\n\n\fmin(A(k), B(k)) < \u221e. By Proposition 5.1, the length of \u03b3k has a kindependent upper bound. Thus we can pass to a subsequence such that\nthe lengths of the Reeb chords \u03b3k converge to a real number L. We can also\npass to a subsequence so that the starting and ending points of the Reeb\n(k)\nchords \u03b3k converge to points y0 , yL \u2208 K. Now as k \u2192 \u221e, the 1-form \u03bb0\n(k)\nconverges to \u03bb0 in C 1 , and so the Reeb vector field for \u03bb0 converges to the\nReeb vector field for \u03bb0 in C 0 . Consequently there is a Reeb chord for \u03bb0 of\nlength L from y0 to yL .\n\nReferences\n[1] C. Abbas, The chord problem and a new method of filling by pseudoholomorphic curves, Int. Math. Res.
