We match these models\nto QCD and provide estimates for hA2 i in terms of other physical quantities. In particular, in the\nsimplest strictly linear radial Regge model with equal residues hA2 i is proportional to the pion decay\nconstant squared.

In fact, in spite of increasing evidence provided by instanton model studies [2],\nphenomenological QCD sum rules re-analyses [3], phenomenological studies of the \u03c4 decay data [4], theoretical considerations [5, 6, 7, 8], quark-model calculations [9, 10], lattice simulations [11, 12], and their relevance in the confinement-deconfinement phase transition [13], the dynamical origin of hA2 i is still unclear.\nFor short and recent reviews see, e.g., [14, 15].\nIn this paper we stress that within the large-Nc expansion the 1/Q2 corrections appear naturally. The\nissue was discussed briefly by Afonin, Andrianov, Andrianov, and Espriu [16] in the framework of a Regge\nmodel. Here we reexamine this point and demonstrate\nthat the signs and magnitudes of both the dimension2 and dimension-4 gluon condensates can be accommodated comfortably with reasonable values of the parameters of the hadronic spectra. The idea of comparing\nRegge models to OPE has been explored in a number\nof works [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22], however with the exception of Ref. [22] the dimension-2 condensate has been\n\n\u2217 Research\n\nsupported by the Polish Ministry of Education and Science, grants 2P03B 02828 and 2P03B 05925, by the Spanish Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores and the Polish Ministry of Education and Science, project 4990/R04/05, by the Spanish DGI and\nFEDER funds with grant no.

We note here a recent attempt to\nparameterize such a dimension-2 object within the holographic approach based on the AdS/CFT correspondence\nand the resulting Regge behavior [23].\nOur method is based on the analysis of the vector and\naxial vector meson correlators and has three basic elements: Firstly, we use the operator product expansion\n(OPE) of QCD with the non-standard 1/Q2 power correction in the V + A meson correlator (the contribution\nvanishes in the V \u2212 A combination). Secondly, confinement is incorporated in terms of the radial Regge spectra\nwhich necessarily satisfy certain constraints at high energies, in particular, residues must asymptotically become\nconstant and the string tensions in the vector and axial vector channels must be the same. Finally, the large\nnumber of colors is assumed, i.e. the correlators are saturated with sharp non-interacting meson states. Matching\nto OPE allows for enforcement of the two Weinberg sum\nrules and for the identification of the QCD condensates\nin terms of the parameters of the model of the hadronic\nspectra. A novel element of our analysis is a consistency\ncondition based on matching the values of the short- and\nlong-distance string tensions.\nWe begin with the basic formulas in order to fix the\nnotation as well as derive formal constraints on the Regge\nmodels in the presence of the hA2 i condensate. The\nOPE of the chirally even and odd combinations of the\ntransverse parts of the\nvector and axial vector currents,\na\n\u03bca\nJV,A\n= \u03c8\u0304i\u03b3 \u03bc {1, \u03b35 } \u03c42 \u03c8, gives in the strict chiral limit\n1 n Nc\nQ2\n\u03a0TV +A (Q2 ) = 2 \u2212\nlog 2\n4\u03c0\n3\n\u03bc\n\u03c0 h\u03b1S G2 i 256\u03c0 3 \u03b1S hq\u0304qi2 o\n\u03b1S \u03bb2\n+\n+\n+ ... ,\n\u2212\n\u03c0 Q2\n3 Q4\n81\nQ6\n32\u03c0 \u03b1S hq\u0304qi2\n+ ... ,\n(1)\n\u03a0TV \u2212A (Q2 ) = \u2212\n9\nQ6\n\n\f2\nwith the non-standard 1/Q2 term proposed in Ref. [24]\npresent. According to Ref. [3] the dimension-2 coefficient\n\u03bb2 is interpreted as the tachyonic gluon mass, mg , providing the short-distance string tension\n\u03c30 = \u22122\u03b1s \u03bb2 /Nc .\n\n(2)\n\nIt is also related to the dimension-2 gluon condensate,\n(3/Nc )2 \u03bb2 = m2g = \u2212 4(NN2c\u22121) g 2 hA2 i, where we have inc\nserted appropriate factors of Nc , such that \u03b1S \u03bb2 \u223c Nc\nand mg \u223c 1.\nNow comes an important observation: The coefficient\nof 1/Q2 is proportional to \u03c30 , and on the other hand,\nas we show shortly, it involves the series over mesonic\nspectra which depend on the long-distance string tension\n\u03c3. This allows for building a sum-rule or a consistency\ncheck, since \u03c3 \u2243 \u03c30 . The near equality is supported by\nSU (2) lattice simulations [6], where only a 92% reduction\nof hA2 i at the deconfinement transition point is found\nsuggesting a similar factor between \u03c3 and \u03c30 .\nIn the large-Nc limit the vacuum sector of QCD becomes a theory of infinitely many non-interacting mesons\nand glueballs, hence the correlators may be saturated by\ninfinitely many meson states. Thus one has, up to subtractions,\n\u03a0TV (Q2 ) =\n\u03a0TA (Q2 ) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n2\nFV,n\n+ c.t.,\n2\nMV,n + Q2\nn=0\n\u221e\n2\nX\nFA,n\nf2\n+\n+\n2\nQ2 n=0 MA,n\n+ Q2\n\nc.t.,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the first term in the axial-vector channel is the\nmassless pion contribution with f = 86MeV denoting\nthe pion decay constant in the chiral limit. Next, we\nuse the radial Regge spectra to saturate the vector and\naxial-vector channels,\n2\n2\n= MA2 + aA n, n = 0, 1, . . .(4)\nMV,n\n= MV2 + aV n, MA,n\n\nwhich is well fulfilled [25] in the experimentally explored region. The vector correlator satisfies the oncesubtracted dispersion relation, hence\n!\n\u221e\n2\n2\nX\nFV,n\nFV,n\nT\n2\n\u03a0V (Q ) =\n. (5)\n\u2212 2\nMV2 + aV n + Q2\nM V + aV n\nn=0\n2\n\nThe sum needs to reproduce the log Q term of the OPE\nexpansion (1), for which only the asymptotic part of the\nspectrum matters. We note that this is the case if at large\nn the behavior of the residues is FV,n \u2243 FV , i.e. there is\nno n-dependence. Similarly, FA,n \u2243 FA . If this is satisfied, then the sum (5) leads to the digamma function,\nwhich upon expansion produces the log Q2 term with\npure power-law corrections (see the following). At first\nsight this seems a rather surprising result, since the condition on residues means that all highly-excited radial\nstates are coupled to the current with equal strength.\n\nHowever, this is toPbe expected. The spectral den2\nsity is \u03c1V (s) = FV2 \u221e\ni=0 \u03b4(s \u2212 MV + aV n), which from\nthe far Euclidean end looks as a continuum of constant\nstrength in the dispersive integral, which obviously gives\nrise to the log Q2 . Any dependence of FV,n or FA,n on n\nwould spoil this behavior and damage the twist expansion. Thus the parton-hadron duality requests, for linear\nradial Regge spectra, asymptotically constant residues.\nThe chirally-odd combination of currents satisfies the\nunsubtracted dispersion relation, which implies\nFV2 /aV = FA2 /aA .\n\n(6)\n\nWith this constraint we may now compute the series\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\n\u0012 2\nF2\nF2\nMV + Q2\nMA + Q2\n\u03a0TV \u2212A (Q2 ) \u2243 \u2212 V \u03c8\n+ A\u03c8\naV\naV\naA\naA\n2\n2\nf\nF\naV\n\u2212 2 = V log\n+ O(1/Q2 ),\n(7)\nQ\naV\naA\nwhere \u03c8(z) = \u0393\u2032 (z)/\u0393(z) is the digamma function, and\ncompare to OPE (1). We also assume aV = aA , which\ntogether with (6) means that for asymptotic n\nFV = FA = F,\n\naV = aA = a.\n\n(8)\n\nNote that aV = aA yields the same density of states in\nthe V and A channels which complies to the \"chiral symmetry restoration\" in the spectra [26, 27].

Matching of the coefficient of the log Q2 to (1) gives\na = 2\u03c0\u03c3 = 24\u03c0 2 F 2 /Nc ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03c3 is the (long-distance) string tension. If we\nuse\n\u221a F = 154MeV from the \u03c1 \u2192 2\u03c0 decay [28] we get\n\u221a\u03c3 = 546MeV. The lattice calculation of Ref. [29] gives\n\u03c3 = 420MeV. We stress that the conditions (8,11)\ncome solely from the asymptotic spectrum and are insensitive to the low-lying states. In addition, we may\nread off from (10) the dimension-2 and -4 condensates.\nThe Regge spectrum assumes confinement, \u03c3 6= 0, as well\nas F 6= 0. The chiral symmetry might a priori be broken or unbroken. However, since \u03c3 \u2243 \u03c30 , also \u03c30 6= 0,\nand this this via (2) implies spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, f 6= 0. Thus, from WSR I MA 6= MV and\nfrom WSR II a = MA2 + MV2 . In this case (1,9,10) give\nMA2 = MV2 +\n\nthe couplings should be the same. In principle, these\nconstants are measurable, thus in the large-Nc world the\nvalues of the OPE condensates can be expressed in terms\nof the parameters of the large-Nc spectra. This is very\nclose to the approach of Ref.[17, 30] with the important\nextension of admitting the possibility of the dimension-2\ncondensate. For the purpose of illustration we consider\nthe following simple modification of the previous model:\n2\nMV,0 = m\u03c1 , MV,n\n= MV2 + an, n \u2265 1,\n\n2\nMA,n\n= MA2 + an, n \u2265 0.\n\nIn words, the lowest \u03c1 mass is shifted, otherwise all is kept\n\"universal\", including constant residues for all states. In\nthe present case the Weinberg sum rules have the form\n(we set Nc = 3 from now on)\nMA2 = MV2 + 8\u03c0 2 f 2 ,\n2\n\n(12)\n\nand\n\u03b1S \u03bb2\n= f 2,\n(13)\n4\u03c0 3\n4\n2\n2\n4\n2\nMA \u2212 4MV MA + MV\n\u03b1S hG i\n=\n12\u03c0\n48\u03c0 2\n4 4\n288\u03c0 f /Nc2 \u2212 24\u03c0 2 f 2 MV2 /Nc \u2212 MV4\n=\n.\n24\u03c0 2\n\n\u2212\n\nThe numerical\nvalue for the dimension-2 condensate is\n2\n\u2212 \u03b1S\u03c0\u03bb = 0.3GeV2 as compared to the value of 0.12GeV2\nfrom Ref. [3, 14]. We note that Andreev [23] also\n2\nquotes the estimate \u2212 \u03b1S\u03c0\u03bb = 0.3GeV2 . Eq. (2) gives\n\u221a\n\u03c30 = 782MeV, about twice as much as deduced from\nEq. (11,12), thus the consistency check is violated badly.\nAlso, the dimension-4 gluon condensate is negative for\nMV \u2265 0.46 GeV. Actually it never, not even at very low\nvalues of MV , reaches the QCD sum-rules value of the\ncondensate. The dimension-6 condensate in the model is\nzero in the V + A channel, while from OPE it should not\nbe. All these problems show that the strictly linear radial\nRegge model with constant residues is too restrictive.\nMore parameters can be inserted in models of the spectra by treating separately the low-lying states, both their\nresidue and position. Actually, this is physical. We know\nthat there are departures from the linear Regge trajectories at low n, also there is no reason why at low energies\n\n8\u03c0 2 f 2 4\u03c0 2 f 2 + MV 2\n\n\u0001\n\n4\u03c0 2 f 2 \u2212 m\u03c1 2 + MV 2\n\n.\n\n(15)\n\nWhen m\u03c1 = 0.77GeV is fixed, the model has only one free\nparameter left.

Remarkably, the window for which both condensates are simultaneously positive yields very acceptable values of \u03c3, cf. Ref. [25].\u221a Moreover, the consistency\ncheck \u03c3 = \u03c30 is satisfied for \u03c3 = 497MeV. The magnitude of the condensates is in the ball park of the \"physical\" values. The value of MV in the fiducial range is\naround 0.82 GeV \u2013 again a very reasonable value. Note\nthe close value of MV to m\u03c1 , 0.82 GeV vs. 0.77 GeV.\nThis shows sensitivity of the condensates even to small\ndeviations from the linearity of the Regge trajectory. The\nexperimental \u03c1 states are at 770, 1450, 1700, 1900, and\n2150 MeV, with the last two states not well established,\nwhile the model with \u03c3 = (0.47 GeV)2 gives 770, 1355,\n1795, and 2147 MeV.

The region in \u03c3 for which both\ncondensates are positive is in the acceptable range compared\nto the estimates of Ref.

As in recent study of Ref. [9], we apply the\nDas-Mathur-Okubo sum rule to evaluate the low-energy\nconstant L10 , and the Das-Guralnik-Mathur-Low-Yuong\nsum rule to obtain the electromagnetic pion mass splitting.

Thus our explicit calculation illustrates the\nsignificance of confinement also for the short-distance expansion, as discussed in Ref. [3, 14]. More generally,\nOPE with the dimension-2 and all other condensates can\nbe matched by radial Regge models, provided conditions\n(8,11) are satisfied by the asymptotic spectra, and the\nparameters of the low-lying states are adjusted to reproduce the values of the condensates. In principle, these\nparameters are measurable, hence the information encoded in the low-lying states is the same as the information in the condensates and we could verify consistency.\nYet the sensitivity of the values of the condensates to\nthe parameters of the spectra, as seen by comparing the\ntwo explicit models considered in this paper, make such\na study difficult at a more precise level.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Oscar Cata, Marteen Golterman, and Santiago Peris for helpful comments.\n\n[17] M.
