In particular Seiberg and Witten [1, 2] found that the low-energy\ndynamics of these theories is governed by the geometry of Riemann surfaces. Moreover Nekrasov\n[3] gave a microscopic derivation of the Seiberg-Witten geometry.\nLast year, a mysterious relation which relates N = 2 gauge theories in four dimensions to\nconformal field theories in two dimension was discovered in [4]. This relation originated in the\nM5-brane construction of N = 2 gauge theories which was developed in [5]. In this construction,\na four-dimensional N = 2 superconformal gauge theory arises from compactification of M5-branes\non a Riemann surface with punctures. Since a N = 2 superconformal gauge theory of such a type\nis associated with a Riemann surface, it is very natural that there exists a relation between the\nSeiberg-Witten-Nekrasov solution of a N = 2 superconformal gauge theory and the conformal field\ntheory on the corresponding surface. Inspired by the development, Alday, Gaiotto and Tachikawa\nfound the specific realization of the idea, which is called the AGT relation [4]: the Nekrasov partition\nfunction of a N = 2 superconformal gauge theory is equal to the Liouville conformal block for the\nRiemann surface.\nThe part of the extended objects, such as 'tHooft-Wilson line operators and surface operators,\nin the dual Liouville theory was explained in [6, 7, 8]: the N = 2 gauge theory in the presence of an\nelementary surface operator corresponds to the Liouville conformal block with an added insertion\nof a degenerate primary field \u03a62,1 (z). The expectation values of 'tHooft-Wilson line operators are\nthen computed by using the monodromy operation for the conformal blocks. In this way the AGT\nrelation can be extended to gauge theories in the presence of extended observables.\nIn this paper we study the stringy realization of the AGT relation in the presence of elementary\nsurface operators. By using M2-brane construction of surface operators [7], we can obtain surface\noperators from toric A-branes of topological string theory via the Ooguri-Vafa duality [9]. This\nis an extended version of the well-known geometric engineering of N = 2 gauge theories in fourdimensions [10]. The open topological string construction enables us to grasp some important\nproperties of the AGT relation.\nIn [4] it was found that the degenerate conformal block in the semi-classical limit gives the\nSeiberg-Witten curve in the Gaiotto form. We interpret this property string-theoretically by using the wave-function behavior of the open topological strings [11] and mirror symmetry. Since\nthis approach gives the differential equation for the expectation value of a surface operator, we\ncan compute it very efficiently. Then we find that a Gaiotto curve relates to mirror Calabi-Yau\ncorresponding to a N = 2 gauge theory via four-dimensional limit or decoupling one of gravity.\n1\n\n\fRecall the extended AGT relation [7] that the insertion of the degenerate field leads to the\nNekrasov partition function in the presence of a surface operator, which we call the ramified instanton partition function. The degenerate conformal block is equal to a certain Nekrasov partition\nfunction for the specialized masses via the AGT relation. These facts imply that the Nekrasov partition function of a gauge theory gives the ramified instanton partition function of another gauge\ntheory by degenerating physical mass parameters. We show that this is precisely the geometric transition of the A-model topological strings under which branes change to the bubbling of a\nbackground Calabi-Yau geometry.\nThe organization of this paper is as follows: In section 2 we study surface operators in the\ncontext of topological string theory. The role of the wave-function behavior in the AGT relation\nbecomes clear. In section 3 we discuss the extended AGT conjecture for the insertion of surface\noperators from the viewpoint of topological string theory. We explain why the degenerate field\ninsertion leads to the inclusion of a surface operator in the gauge theory side. The geometric\ntransition gives a partial explanation to the question. In Appendix A we present a brief review on\nthe Young diagrams and the Schur functions. We review the five-dimensional Nekrasov partition\nfunctions and the refined vertex in Appendix B.\nWhile preparing this paper, [12] which has some overlap with this paper appeared.\n\n2\n\nSurface Operators and Topological Strings\n\nIn this section we study the simple surface operators of N = 2 four dimensional gauge theories via\nthe geometric engineering. We illustrate the relation between toric branes and surface operators\nwith a simple example, which is called the T3,0 theory. This theory was studied extensively in\n[13, 14, 15]. We show that the Gaiotto curve for the gauge theory comes of the wave function\nbehavior of the corresponding open topological string amplitude.\n\n2.1\n\nToric brane and surface operator for T3,0 theory\n\nT3,0 (A1 ) theory, which is just the theory of four free hypermultiplets, are associated with the\nRiemann sphere with three punctures via the AGT relation. In this section, we study how surface\noperators arise from string theory setup. The key to stringy realization is the geometric engineering\nof N = 2 gauge theories. In [10] it was shown that Seiberg-Witten solutions are engineered from\nthe genus-zero topological string theory on the corresponding Calabi-Yau geometries. The higher\ngenus extension of the engineering was studied extensively in [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21], and they\nfound that all-genus topological string partition function leads to the Nekrasov partition functions\n\n2\n\n\fthrough the topological vertex formalism [22]. The toric geometry which engineers the SU (2) gauge\ntheory with four flavors is shown in the left side of Fig.1.\n\nFigure 1: The toric geometry which engineers the SU (2) gauge theory with four flavors (left) and\nthe corresponding Gaiotto curve (right). This geometry is constructed by gluing two geometries\nthat engineers the four free hypermultiplets theory respectively.\nLet us compactify M5-branes on a Riemann surface in order to construct N = 2 gauge theory\n[25, 5]. The SU (2) gauge theory with four flavors T4,0 (A1 ) comes of the Riemann surface with four\npunctures. We turn off the gauge coupling to get free theory: this is done by tearing the surface into\nspheres with three punctures. Since the Riemann sphere with four punctures degenerates into two\nRiemann surfaces with three punctures, we obtain the toric geometry associated with this T3,0 (A1 )\ntheory by decomposing the toric geometry of T4,0 (A1 ) as Fig.1. We thus employ the half-geometry\nof Fig.1 as the toric geometry for the T3,0 theory.\nLet us consider the open A-model topological strings on this geometry in the presence of a\ntoric A-brane on a non-compact Lagrangian submanifold. Let U be the holonomy matrix for the\nnon-dynamical gauge field on the A-brane. The open A-model amplitude for Fig.2 is then given by\nZ open =\n\nX\nY\n\nTrY U * ZY (Q1 , Q2 , Q3 ; q),\n\n(2.1)\n\nand it is easy to compute ZY (Q1 , Q2 , Qf ; q) by using the topological vertex [22]. We will compute\nthe refined version of the amplitude in the next section. Since we insert a single A-brane, the\nholonomy is one by one matrix U = diag(z). The trace for the representation R is then nonzero only for the Young diagrams with one column Y = [1n ], and we obtain the following simple\n\n3\n\n\fFigure 2: The open A-model topological strings with a toric A-brane on the leg. The background\ngeometry is the toric Calabi-Yau three-fold which engineers the T3,0 theory. The dotted line here\ndenotes the non-compact Lagrangian branes.

Since q \u2212\u2202u is the shift operator q \u2212\u2202u e\u2212u = qe\u2212u ,\nit acts on the partition function as follows:\n(1 \u2212 q \u2212\u2202u ) * e\u2212nu Z (n) = (1 \u2212 q n ) * e\u2212nu Z (n) =\n\n(1 \u2212 q n\u22121 Q1 )(1 \u2212 q n\u22121 Q1 Q2 Q3 ) \u2212u \u2212(n\u22121)u (n\u22121)\ne e\nZ\n.\n(1 \u2212 q n\u22121 Q1 Q3 )\n\nTherefore, the operator 1 \u2212 q \u2212\u2202u shifts the length of a column [1n ]. This relation gives the following\ndifferential equation for the open string partition function\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n(1 \u2212 Q1 Q3 q \u2212\u2202u \u22121 )(1 \u2212 q \u2212\u2202u ) \u2212 z(1 \u2212 Q1 q \u2212\u2202u )(1 \u2212 Q1 Q2 Q3 q \u2212\u2202u ) Z open (z) = 0.\n4\n\n(2.5)\n\n\fThis characteristic of the open topological string amplitudes is called the wave function behavior\n[11, 23, 24]. This feature relates to the mirror B-model of the system: the mirror of A-brane is\nthe fermion \u03c8(z) in the two-dimensional Kodaira-Spencer theory. Then quantization of such a\nmirror system on a Riemann surface leads to the wave equation H * h\u03c8i = 0. The Hamiltonian,\nor the Schr\u00f6ringer difference operator H, is associated with the local mirror Calabi-Yau geometry\nxy + H(u, v) = 0.

We study the recursion relation from the viewpoint\nof the geometric engineering of the gauge theories.\n\nField theory limit\nLet ~ be the self-dual \u03a9-background in four dimensions \u01eb1 = \u2212\u01eb2 = ~. Then the gauge theory\nparameters are introduced by\nq = e\u2212R~ ,\n\nQa = e\u2212Rma ,\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere R and ma are the fifth-dimensional radius and masses respectively. We take the fourdimensional limit of the open string amplitude as follows:\nW (n) (z) = lim Rn\u22121 W(n) (z),\nR\u21920\n\n(2.8)\n\nwhere W(0) = W . Then the four-dimensional partition function, which corresponds to the Nekrasov\npartition function in the presence of a surface operator, takes the following form:\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014 \u0012\n1\nopen\nW(z) + W(1) (z) + ~W(2) + * * *\n.\n\u03a8(z) = lim Z\n(z) = exp \u2212\nR\u21920\n~\nn\n\u221e\nY\nX\n(j~ \u2212 ~ + m1 )(j~ \u2212 ~ + m1 + m2 + m3 )\nzn\n=\n.\nj~(j~ \u2212 ~ + m1 + m3 )\nn=0\n\n(2.9)\n\nj=1\n\nNotice that this is a fundamental solution of the hypergeometric differential equation near z = 0\n\u0013\n\u0012\nm1 m1 + m2 + m3 m1 + m3\n,\n;\n;z .\n(2.10)\n2 F1\n~\n~\n~\nThis coincides with the sphere conformal block with the insertion of two primary fields and a\ndegenerate field.\nWe want to extract the information of the Seiberg-Witten curve, or Gaiotto curve, from the\npartition function. The wave function behavior then plays a key role. Let us expand the differential\n5\n\n\fequation in R\n(m1 + m3 \u2212 ~\u2202u \u2212 ~ + * * * )(\u2212~\u2202u + * * * )\n\u0001\n\u2212 z(m1 \u2212 ~\u2202u + * * * )(m1 + m2 + m3 \u2212 ~\u2202u + * * * ) Z open (z) = 0,\n\n(2.11)\n\nwhere the dots * * * represent terms of order O(R). In the field theory limit, the wave equation (2.5)\ntakes the following form\n\u0002\n\n(1 \u2212 z)~2 \u2202u 2 \u2212 ((m1 + m3 \u2212 ~) \u2212 z(2m1 + m2 + m3 )) ~\u2202u\n\u0003\n\u2212 zm1 (m1 + m2 + m3 ) \u03a8(z) = 0.\n\n(2.12)\n\nThis four-dimensional open string wave function is exactly the hypergeometric differential equation\nwhose solution is (2.9). The lesson here is that the wave function behavior of the open topological\nstrings gives the null state condition on the degenerate conformal blocks which are the ramified\ninstanton partition functions via the AGT relation. This construction, or the geometric engineering,\nof the the ramified Nekrasov partition functions implies that the Gaiotto curve can be derived from\nthe mirror Riemann surface via geometric engineering.\nThe wave function (2.12) in the leading order ~0 constraints the superpotential W, which is\nfour-dimensional limit of the disk amplitude, as follows\n(1 \u2212 z)\u2202u W(z)2 + ((m1 + m3 ) \u2212 z(2m1 + m2 + m3 )) \u2202u W(z) \u2212 zm1 (m1 + m2 + m3 ) = 0. (2.13)\nIt is easy to solve this \"loop equation\" as follows\nq\nZ z \u03b12 (z \u2032 2 \u2212 z \u2032 ) + \u03b12 (1 \u2212 z \u2032 ) + \u03b12 z \u2032\n1\n2\n3\ndz \u2032 ,\nW(z) = \u03b12 log z + \u03b13 log(1 \u2212 z) \u00b1\nz \u2032 (1 \u2212 z \u2032 )\n\n(2.14)\n\nwhere we introduce the CFT parameters\nm1 = \u2212\u03b11 + \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b13 ,\n\nm2 = \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b13 ,\n\nm3 = \u03b11 + \u03b12 + \u03b13 .\n\n(2.15)\n\n\u2032\n\nThe logarithmic terms of the solution are just the overall factor z \u03b1 (1 \u2212 z)\u03b1 . The Gaiotto curve is\nthen given by \u2202u W(0) = \u03c62 (z) as follows:\n\u03c62 (z) =\n\np\n\n\u03b121 (z 2 \u2212 z) + \u03b122 (1 \u2212 z) + \u03b123 z\n.\nz(1 \u2212 z)\n\n(2.16)\n\nThis is the well-known Gaiotto curve for the sphere with three punctures, or the N = 2 theory of\nfour free hypermultiplets T3,0 [13, 14].\n\n6\n\n\fGeneric \u03a9-background and Nekrasov-Shatashivili limit\nWe can also compute the wave function for the generic \u03a9-background \u01eb1 6= \u2212\u01eb2 . We call the\ncorresponding extension of topological string theory \"the refinement\" [26]. The refined topological\nvertex computation in the next section leads to the refined partition function\nZ open (z) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nzn\n\nn=0\n\nn\nY\n(1 \u2212 q i\u22121 Q1 )(1 \u2212 q i\u22121 Q1 Q2 Q3 )\ni=1\n\n(1 \u2212 q i )(1 \u2212 q i t\u22121 Q1 Q3 )\n\n.\n\n(2.17)\n\nThe difference equation follows from this expression of the refined partition function:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(1 \u2212 Q1 Q3 q \u2212\u2202u t\u22121 )(1 \u2212 q \u2212\u2202u ) \u2212 z(1 \u2212 Q1 q \u2212\u2202u )(1 \u2212 Q1 Q2 Q3 q \u2212\u2202u ) Z open (z) = 0.\n\n(2.18)\n\nThis difference equation is the five-dimensional lift of the differential equation derived from the null\ncondition of the degenerate field [14, 15]. It would be interesting to study such difference equations\nby employing the five-dimensional version of the AGT relation and the q-Virasoro conformal blocks\n[27].\nAn important feature of the refined wave-equation is that it depends almost exclusively on q (or\nt) for the brane on an un-preferred toric leg1 [26, 28]. Recall that \u01eb1,2 are the rotational parameters\nof two distinct planes in C2 , and a sueface operator fills one plane. It is therefore natural that the\ncorresponding toric brane senses one-half of these parameters. In the following, we study the wavefunction in the Nekrasov-Shatashivili limit t \u2192 1 [29]. Now let us assume that the wave function in\nthe limit is almost equal to the unrefined one. Then we can use the following mirror wave-equation\nfor the toric brane [11] in place of the differential equation in the Nekrasov-Shatashivili limit\nH(ep , ex ) * Z open (z) = 0,\n\n(2.19)\n\nwhere [x, p] = gs . Note that the polynomial H(ep , ex ) = 0 defines the mirror curve of the toric\ngeometry. We expect that this equation essentially leads to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the\ncorresponding integrable system.\nLet us take the SU (2) pure super Yang-Mills theory for example. The quadrangle toric webdiagram describes the Calabi-Yau three-fold which engineers the gauge theory (see Fig.4). Since we\nobtain the mirror geometry by fatting the toric diagram off, the genus of the corresponding curve\nis one. The local mirror symmetry [10] implies the defining equation\nz+\n1\n\n1\n+ y 2 + c1 y + c0 = 0,\nz\n\n(2.20)\n\nIn this paper we study toric branes on an un-preferred leg of the refined topological vertex. Branes placed on\n\nthe preferred leg lead to the homological link invariants through the geometric transition [28].\n\n7\n\n\fwhere we fix the irrelevant coefficients by re-normalization.

We also fix\nu=\n\n1\n\u039bc1 2\n\u2212\n,\nR2\n4\n\n(2.22)\n\nin order to recover the Seiberg-Witten curve:\n2\n\n\u039b\n\n\u0012\n\n1\nz+\nz\n\n\u0013\n\n+\n\ny+\n\nr\n\n1\n\u2212u\nR2\n\n!2\n\n+ u = 0.\n\n(2.23)\n\nThen the field theory limit R \u2192 0 implies\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n2\n\u039b z+\n+ p2 + u = 0.\n(2.24)\nz\np\nwhere we take y = \u2212e\u2212Rp 1/R2 \u2212 u. In this limit, the quantization condition of the mirror curve\n\nbecomes [x, p] = \u01eb1 where z = ex . This is precisely the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the sine-Gordon\n\nmodel\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\u0001\n\u2202\n2\nx\n\u2212x\n\u01eb1\n+\u039b e +e\n+ u \u03a8 = 0.\n\u2202x\n2\n\n(2.25)\n\nIn [30, 31, 32, 33], the authors have proposed that the wave-functionof the sine-Gordon system is\nequal to the ramified Nekrasov partition function in the Nekrasov-Shatashivili limit. Our argument\ngives a naive derivation of the conjecture from the perspective of the geometric engineering.\nNotice that we have assumed that the open string amplitude in the limit t = 1 satisfies essentially\nthe same equation as the self-dual case q = t. It is not evident that such an observation is true\nfor more complicated cases. In fact the dual-CFT computation in [33] shows that the differential\nequations for SU (2) gauge theories also depend on \u01eb2 . This fact suggests that we have to modify\nour naive derivation. Thus it is very important to improve our sketch of stringy derivation by\nformulating the refined version of the B-model and the corresponding integrable systems.\n\n2.3\n\nGeometric engineering of surface operators\n\nSo far, we have assumed that an open topological A-model amplitude gives the corresponding\nNekrasov partition function in the presence of a surface operator. We then verify this expectation\nby combining the stringy construction of surface operators with string dualities.\n8\n\n\fLet us start with the M-theory construction of surface operators. Recall that a gauge theory of\n[5] can be realized as the world-volume theory of M5-branes compactified on a punctured Riemann\nsurface. A surface operators is then engineered by a semi-infinite transverse M2-brane. Let x, y \u2208 C\n\nbe two complex combination of four coordinates x4 , x5 , x6 and x7 . Then the holomolorphic curve\nwhich M5-branes wrap is described by \u03a3 : H(x, y) = 0. We summarize the configuration as follows:\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n\u03a3\n\nM5\n\u00d7\n\nM2\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u00d7\n\n(2.26)\n\nLet us move on to Type IIA superstring setup. The dimensional reduction along the M-circle x10\nleads to the type IIA string theory with NS5-branes on \u03a3 and a transverse D2-brane.\nRecall that the transversal T-duality replaces N NS5-branes to a local AN \u22121 singularity [34, 35].\nAfter T-dualizing, the circle fiber degenerates on the locus on which the NS5-branes were placed.\nThus, taking the T-duality along the circle transverse to \u03a3 [36], we obtain the type IIB string\ntheory on the following Calabi-Yau geometry\nuv + H(x, y) = 0.\n\n(2.27)\n\nThen the D2 brane changes into a semi-infinite D3-brane by the T-duality. This D3-brane wraps\nthe following two-cycle parametrized a complex parameter H(x0 , y0 ) = 0\nu = 0,\n\nv = arbitrary,\n\nH(x0 , y0 ) = 0.\n\n(2.28)\n\nThe cylinder fiber uv = \u2212H over the xy-plane degenerates on the curve H(x, y) = 0 into two\ncones corresponding to uv = 0, and the D3-brane wraps one of them as illustrated in Fig.3. The\n\nFigure 3: The D3 brane wraps the non-compact two-cycle whose circle fibration degenerates on the\nbase Riemann surface H(x, y) = 0.\n\n9\n\n\fparameter (x0 , y0 ) is a modulus of the D-brane, which corresponds to a point on the base Riemann\nsurface \u03a3. This modulus parametrizes an elementary surface operator.\nFinally we apply the mirror symmetry on this type IIB setup. The mirror of the geometry (2.27)\nis well-studied [37]: it is a toric Calabi-Yau three-fold whose toric diagram is the skeleton which\nis obtained by thinning down the Riemann surface \u03a3. The mirror brane of (2.28) is also studied\nin [38, 39]: it is the D4-brane which wraps the non-compact Lagrangian three-cycle corresponding\nto the semi-infinite line on the toric diagram as Fig.4. This D4-brane also fills the subspace of the\nspace-time R2 \u2282 R4 . This is precisely the setup of the Ooguri-Vafa duality [9]. As was explained in\n\nFigure 4: The toric diagram of the Calabi-Yau mirror to uv + H(x, y) = 0. The toric skeleton is\njust the thinned Riemann surface H(x, y) = 0.\n[9], we can compute the effective F-term in the presence of the D4-brane by counting the open worldsheet instantons via the A-model open topological strings. The open topological string amplitude\nfor a toric Calabi-Yau such as Fig.4 is computed by using the topological vertex formalism. Note\nthat the topological vertex for the closed topological strings on the engineering toric Calabi-Yau\ngives the corresponding Nekrasov partition function. Therefore, by introducing the Lagrangian\nbrane, we can extend this idea to the instanton counting in the presence of surface operators. In\nthis way string dualities verify the observation that the open topological string amplitude for the\ntoric Calabi-Yau which engineers a gauge theory leads to the ramified instanton partition function.\nFrom this stringy realization of surface operator, we can also explain why the insertion of the\ndegenerate field \u03a62,1 leads to a ramified instanton partition function. Recall the discussion of [43]:\nthe collective fields for the matrix corresponding to the B-model imply the Liouville field. The\nmirror of N toric A-brane is N B-brane whose matrix description is the insertion of\nVN (z) = det(\u03a6 \u2212 z)\u03b2N = e\u2212N \u01eb1 \u03c6(z)/2 ,\n\n(2.29)\n\np\nwhere \u03a6 is the matrix field, \u03c6 is the Liouville field and \u03b2 = \u2212\u01eb2 /\u01eb1 [43]. Here we use the CFT\n\u221a\ndescription of matrix model \u2212\u01eb1 \u01eb2 \u2202\u03c6 = tr (z \u2212 \u03a6)\u22121 . A single brane N = 1 thus leads to the\n10\n\n\fdegenerate field \u03a62,1 = e\u2212b\u03c6 of interest. In this way we can show that the degenerate field leads to\nthe surface operator via the string dualities. See [44, 45, 46, 47] for details of the \u03b2-ensemble which\nis the B-model in the generic \u03a9-background.\nIn the next section, we study the AGT relation by using this topological string description of\nthe surface operators. We employ the refined topological vertex in order to deal with the generic\n\u03a9-background \u01eb1,2 .\n\n3\n\nGeometric Transition and AGT relation\n\nIn this section we explain why the degenerate field insertion gives the instanton partition function\nin the presence of a surface operator. We employ the concept of the geometric transition [40, 41, 42]\nfor the purpose of studying this aspect of the AGT relation.\n\n3.1\n\nGeometric engineering of surface operators\n\nLet us recall the two dual constructions of surface operators: the insertion of degenerate fields in the\nCFT side and the open string version of the geometric engineering with toric branes of topological\nstrings. By comparing these two approachs, we reveal an interesting aspect of the AGT relation\nwhich is a gauge theory version of the open/closed duality.\nSurface operators from degenerate AGT relations\nBy using the AGT relation, we can compute an instanton partition function from the corresponding\nconformal block of the Liouville CFT. The Nekrasov partition function in the presence of a surface\noperator also can be calculated by introducing an additional degenerate field in the corresponding\nconformal block. This result implies the following characteristic: by the specialization of parameters\n\nFigure 5: T2,1 v.s. T1,1 : torus with two punctures and torus with a puncture and a degenerate\nfield insertion. The X denotes the insertion of a degenerate field.\nwhich corresponds to change a primary to a degenerate field in the Liouville CFT side, an ordinary\nNekrasov partition function leads to a surface operator partition function of another gauge theory.\n11\n\n\fSee Fig.5 for a typical example. The torus with two primary fields (punctures) corresponding to\nthe so-called \u00c21 quiver gauge theory (a.k.a. the T2,1 theory). On the one hand, the torus with a\n\nprimary and a degenerate fields, which is the right hand side of Fig.5, describes the N = 2\u2217 theory\n\nwith an elementary surface operator. We can therefore obtain the surface operator of N = 2\u2217\n\ntheory by adjusting the parameters of the Nekrasov partition function of the \u00c21 quiver to the\ninsertion of the degenerate field.\nIt is very unclear why surface operators emerge only by adjusting physical parameters of a\ngauge theory. In this section we explain this phenomena from the perspective of the open/closed\nduality. Before studying it, we mention to the stringy version of this characteristic.\nSurface operators from open topological strings\nAs we saw in the previous section, surface operators emerge from the topological A-branes via the\ngeometric engineering. Meanwhile we can compute a partition function for surface operator from a\nNekrasov partition function by choosing degenerate parameters of a gauge theory. The open string\namplitude which engineers a surface operator therefore comes of an closed string partition function\nby adjusting parameters. This stringy situation corresponding to the N = 2\u2217 theory (Fig.5) is\n\nFigure 6: The toric geometry which engineers the SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00c21 quiver gauge theory T2,1 and\nbrane insertion in the T1,1 geometry.\nillustrated in Fig.6. Then a question arises: why do the open strings be recovered from the closed\nstrings by choosing degenerate parameters? We will give an answer to this question by utilizing\nthe open/closed duality, or the geometric transition, of the topological string theory.\n\n12\n\n\f3.2\n\nT4,0 : SU(2) gauge theory with 4 flavors\n\nLet us consider the simple example, SU (2) gauge theory with 4 flavors (a.k.a the T4,0 [A1 ] theory).\nThis theory is related to the sphere with four functures through the M5-brane construction. In\norder to introduce a surface operator, we need to add a degenerate field in the CFT side. We then\nobtain the sphere with five functures, which corresponds to the T5,0 [A1 ] theory. We therefore study\nthe geometric engineering of the T5,0 [A1 ] theory.\nT5,0 : SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) quiver gauge theory\nThe T5,0 [A1 ] theory is the SU (2)\u00d7SU (2) quiver gauge theory with a bifundamental hypermultiplets\nand two fundamentals for each SU (2). This theory is engineered by the toric Calabi-Yau geometry\nwhich is illustrated in Fig.7.\nThe topological string partition function for the generic \u03a9-background is computed by using the\nrefined topological vertex. We compute it by dividing this geometry into three parts in order to get\nthe expression of the Nekrasov-type. See Appendix B for the definition of the refined topological\nvertex. We choose the horizontal direction for the preferred one of the refined vertex as in [26, 48].\n\nFigure 7: The toric geometry which engineers the SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) linear quiver gauge theory T5,0 .\nLet us compute the partial amplitude in the left side of Fig.7. We attach Young diagrams Y1,2\non the two chopped edges. Since all the bundles over the local curve CP1 inside the geometry are\nO(\u22121) \u2295 O(\u22121), the framing numbers are all zero and we need not to insert any framing factors.\n\n13\n\n\fThe topological string amplitude is then given by\nZ L Y1 ,Y2 (t, q; Qm1 , Qm2 , Qf1 ) =\n\nX\n(\u2212Qm1 )|R1 | (\u2212Qf1 )|R2 | (\u2212Qm2 )|R3 |\nRi\n\n\u00d7 CR1 \u03a6 Y1 (t, q)CR1 T R2 \u03a6 (q, t)CR3 R2 T Y2 (t, q)CR3 T \u03a6 \u03a6 (q, t)\n=\n\n2\nY\n\nq\n\n||Ya ||2\n2\n\nZ\u0303Ya (t, q)\n\na=1\n\nX\n\nSR1 T ( Qm1 Qf1 t\u2212\u03c1 q \u2212Y1 )\n\nRi ,V,W\n\n\u2212\u03c1\n\u00d7 SR1 /V (\u2212Q\u22121\nf1 q ) SR2 /V (\u2212\n\np\n\nq/t Qf1 t\u2212\u03c1 )\n\np\nT\n\u00d7 SR2 T /W ( t/q t\u2212Y2 q \u2212\u03c1 ) SR3 T /W (t\u2212\u03c1 q \u2212Y2 )\n\u00d7 SR3 (\u2212Qm2 q \u2212\u03c1 ).\n\n(3.1)\n\nThis is a typical strip geometry partition function which is ubiquitous in the geometric engineering\nof the superconfomal gauge theories.

The AGT relation suggests that\nthe following specialization which corresponds to the degeneration of a primary field leads to the\nNekrasov partition function in the presence of a surface operator:\n\u00e3 = \u2212m\u03031 = m\u03032 + \u01eb1 .\n\n(3.17)\n\nThen the K\u00e4her parameters of the toric geometry take the quantized values\nQ\u0303m1 = q \u22123/2 t1/2 ( \u2192 q \u22121\nQ\u0303m2 = q \u22121/2 t1/2 ( \u2192 1\n\nwhen q = t ),\nwhen q = t ).\n\n(3.18)\n(3.19)\n\nNote that t\u0303m1 and t\u0303m2 here are essentially 0 and gs , where gs is the topological string coupling\nconstant. The geometric transition will explain this quantization of the K\u00e4her parameters.\n16\n\n.\n\n\fThis degeneration of the K\u00e4her parameters simplifies the topological string partition function.\nLet us focus on the instanton measure coming from the fundamentals:\nY\n\nf =1,2\n\n~ , m\u0303f ; t, q) \u2192\nzfund.,5D (~\u00e3, W\n\nY\n\n(i,j)\u2208W1\n\n(1 \u2212 ti\u22121 q \u2212j+2 )\n\nY\n\n(i,j)\u2208W2\n\n(1 \u2212 ti\u22121 q \u2212j+1 )\n\n(3.20)\n\nFrom these factors, the Young diagram W1 must not contain the box (1, 2) and W2 must be the\nempty Young diagram \u03a6 in order to give a non-zero contribution to the partition function. This\n~ have to take the following form:\nmeans that the Young diagrams W\nW1 = [1n ] ( n = 0, 1, 2, * * * ),\n\nW2 = \u03a6.\n\n(3.21)\n\nThese degenerate parameters thus cut off the toric geometry of the original theory as Fig.8. This\ntoric geometry is very resemble to that of the SU (2) gauge theory with four flavors. The reason of\nit will soon be clear.\n\nFigure 8: The toric geometry which engineers the SU (2) gauge theory with four flavors in the\npresence of the simple surface operator.\n~ = ([1n ], \u03a6) simplifies the partition function for the T5,0 [A1 ] theory. Due to the\nThe limitation W\nAGT relation, the resulting partition function is precisely the ramified instanton partition function\nfor the Nf = 4 theory. In this way the degeneration of parameters gives the five-dimensional\nNekrasov partition for the SU (2) gauge theory with four flavors in the presence of a surface operator:\n\u03a8 T4,0 ,5D (z) =\n\nX\n\n~ ; t, q)\nz n Q|Y1 |+|Y2 | zvect.,5D (~a, Y\n\nY1,2 , n\n\nY\n\nzfund.,5D (~a, Y~ , mf ; t, q)\n\nf =1,2\n\n~ ; (\u2212m\u03031 , m\u03031 ), ([1n ], \u03a6); m; t, q)\n\u00d7 zbifund.,5D (~a, Y\n\nn\nY\n\u00d7 zvect.,5D ((\u2212m\u03031 , m\u03031 ), ([1 ], \u03a6); t, q) (1 \u2212 e2Rm\u03031 ti\u22121 )(1 \u2212 ti\u22121 q).\nn\n\n(3.22)\n\ni=1\n\nWe can recast it into the Nekrasov partition function for the Nf = 4 theory with an added insertion\n\n17\n\n\fof the factor coming of the surface operator\n\u03a8 T4,0 ,5D (z) =\n\nX\n\nn\n\nz Q\n\n|Y1 |+|Y2 |\n\n~ ; t, q)\nzvect.,5D (~a, Y\n\nY1,2 , n\n\n\u00d7\n\n4\nY\n\nf =1\n\nn\n2\nY\nN[1n ],Ya (e\u2212R(aa \u2212m4 +\u01eb) ; q; t) Y\n\na=1\n\nzfund.,5D (~a, Y~ , mf ; t, q)\n\nN\u03a6,Ya\n\n(e\u2212R(aa \u2212m4 +\u01eb) ; q; t)\n\ni=1\n\n1\n(1 \u2212\n\nti )(1\n\n\u2212\n\ne\u2212R(m3 \u2212m4 ) ti q \u22121 )\n\n,\n\n(3.23)\n\nwhere we introduce the mass parameters\nm3 = m \u2212 m\u03031 + \u01eb,\n\nm4 = m + m\u03031 + \u01eb.\n\n(3.24)\n\nThis formula is the five-dimensional lift of the result of [15]. While the four-dimensional version of\n(3.23) was derived from the conformal block via the AGT relation in [15], we employ the topological\nvertex for engineering the ramified instanton partition function.\nNow let us move on to make the meaning of the specialization (3.18) and (3.19) clear. The\npoint is that the toric brane realization of surface operators leads to these special values through\nthe open/closed duality. Let us consider the system which is drawn on the left side of Fig.9. As\n\nFigure 9: The geometric transition relates the surface-operator/toric-brane insertion and the bubbling geometry which engineers the SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) linear quiver gauge theory T5,0 .\nwe have discussed in the previous section, the Lagrangian brane denoted by the broken line in\nFig.9 engineers the surface operator. Here we introduce the framing in order to compactify the\nLagrangian cycle. Such a compactification does not essentially change the amplitude since the\nA-model topological string theory is independent of the complex structure moduli. Then we apply\nthe geometric transition [40] which changes branes into the background geometry. The multiplicity\nof branes then becomes the K\u00e4hler parameter of the emerged cycle. The geometric transition\nfor our system is shown in Fig.9. Since we have inserted only one brane on the upper leg as\nin Fig.9, a new CP1 whose size is t\u03031 = gs emerges into the toric geometry after the transition.\nThere is also the Lagrangian cycle S 3 without a brane. This Lagrangian three-cycle gives the zerosize CP1 through the transition. In this way, the geometric transition relates the two reaization\nof the surface operator: the open topological string approach and the closed topological string for\n18\n\n\fFigure 10: The toric geometry which engineers the SU (Nc ) Nf = 2Nc gauge theory in the presence\nof the elementary surface operator.\ndegenerate parameters. The refined version of the brane-induced parameters t\u03031,2 = gs , 0 is precisely\nequal to (3.18) and (3.19) which were derived from the CFT side.\nThe phenomenon which changes branes into two-cycles is known as the bubbling Calabi-Yau\n[50, 51]. The field theory limit of such a duality then proves the implication of the AGT relation: the\nramified instanton partition function for an elementary surface operator emerges from the Nekrasov\npartition function by limiting the parameters. This feature provides an efficient tool to compute\nramified instanton partition functions.\n\n3.3\n\nGeneralization to SU(Nc ) gauge theory with 2Nc flavors\n\nWe can easily generalize this result to the T4,0 [ANc \u22121 ] theory. The toric geometry for the SU (Nc )\ngauge theory can be obtained by gluing the geometries for SU (2) theory in vertical direction. See\n[49] for details. We choose the degenerate parameters as in Fig.10. The refined vertex on the\nstrip geometry then leads to the following factors for each O(\u22121) \u2295 O(\u22121) curve inside the strip\ngeometry\nY\n\n(i,j)\u2208W1\n\n(1 \u2212 ti\u22121 q \u2212j+2 )\n\nNc\nY\n\nY\n\na=2 (i,j)\u2208Wa\n\n(1 \u2212 ti\u22121 q \u2212j+1 ).\n\n(3.25)\n\nThe Young diagrams take the following form give the non-zero contribution for the partition function:\nW1 = [1n ] ( n = 0, 1, 2, * * * ),\n\nW2,3,*** ,Nc = \u03a6.\n\n(3.26)\n\nTherefore the toric geometry Fig.10 engineers the ramified instanton partition function for the\nSU (Nc ) gauge theory with 2Nc flavors.\n\n19\n\n\fFigure 11: The toric geometry which engineers the N = 2\u2217 gauge theory T1,1 .

Our study\nsuggests that topological string theory provides the powerful way to reveal the mechanism behind\nthe mysterious AGT relation.\nWe study the geometric engineering of the Nekrasov partition function in the presence of the\nsurface operator, which we call the ramified instanton partition function. We find that a toric\nA-brane corresponds to a surface operator of gauge theory through string dualities. We show that\nwe can derive Gaiotto curves from the wave functions for the open topological string amplitudes\nbased on the idea. This approach will be an alternative to the matrix model computation of the\nB-model in [15].\nWe also show that the insertion of surface operators leads to the bubbling of Calabi-Yau geometry. By using this idea, we compute the ramified instanton partition functions for the Nf = 4,\nN = 2\u2217 and pure Yang-Mills theory. Our approach provides an efficient way to compute the\nramified instanton partition functions for elementary surface operators and their five-dimensional\nlifts.\nThere are many open problems related to our study. For example, it would be very interesting\nto develop topological string realization for more generic type of surface operators such as the full\ntype in [59]. Since these operators appear when we study SU (N \u2265 3) gauge theories [60, 61], we\nwould get the idea from topological strings on toric geometries with long strip. It would be also\nimportant to study relation to the Hitchin systems [62, 63], which are expected to play a key role\nin the AGT relation. We want to come back to these problems in the future.\n\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank Kazunobu Maruyoshi for useful comments and discussion.
