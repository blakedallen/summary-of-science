We present the catalogue of the REFLEX Cluster Survey providing information on the X-ray properties,\nredshifts, and some identification details of the clusters in the REFLEX sample. The catalogue describes a statistically complete X-ray flux-limited sample of 447 galaxy clusters above an X-ray flux of 3 10\u221212 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 (0.1\nto 2.4 keV) in an area of 4.24 ster in the southern sky. The cluster candidates were first selected by their X-ray\nemission in the ROSAT-All Sky Survey and subsequently spectroscopically identified in the frame of an ESO key\nprogramme. Previously described tests have shown that the sample is more than 90% complete and there is a\nconservative upper limit of 9% on the fraction of clusters with a dominant X-ray contamination from AGN. In\naddition to the cluster catalogue we also describe the complete selection criteria as a function of the sky position\nand the conversion functions used to analyse the X-ray data. These are essential for the precise statistical analysis\nof the large-scale cluster distribution. This data set is at present the largest, statistically complete X-ray galaxy\ncluster sample. Together with these data set we also provide for the first time the full three-dimensional selection\nfunction. The sample forms the basis of several cosmological studies, one of the most important applications being\nthe assessment of the statistics of the large-scale structure of the universe and the test of cosmological models.\nPart of these cosmological results have already been published. \u22c6\u22c6\n\n1. Introduction\nClusters of galaxies are the largest building blocks of our\nUniverse that can still reasonably well be characterized as\nunique objects. This makes them on one hand very important large-scale astrophysical laboratories in which a large\nvariety of astrophysical processes can be studied in well\nSend offprint requests to: H. B\u00f6hringer\nhxb@mpe.mpg.de\n\u22c6\nBased on observations at the European Southern\nObservatory La Silla, Chile\n\u22c6\u22c6\nThe full versions of Tables 2 through 9 will be\navailable in electronic form at the CDS via anonymous\nftp\nto\ncdsarc.u-strasbg.fr\n(130.79.128.5)\nor\nvia\nhttp://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?J/A+A/\nas\nwell\nas\non\nour\nhome\npage\nhttp://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/theorie/REFLEX/DATA\n\ncharacterized environments. For these laboratories we can\nmeasure for example their total gravitational mass, their\nmatter composition, the internal gas density, temperature,\nand pressure of the intergalactic medium, their distance,\nand other important properties. The best basis for such\nastrophysical studies is a well documented catalogue of\ngalaxy clusters to choose the best suited objects for the\nprospective study (e.g. B\u00f6hringer et al. 2001b).\nOn the other hand X-ray selected galaxy clusters\nare very good tracers of the large-scale structure of the\nUniverse. Since there is a quite well understood relation\nbetween the distribution of galaxy clusters with known\nmass and the dark matter distribution, the statistics of\nthe large-scale matter distribution in the Universe can be\nderived from the distribution of clusters in a well selected,\nstatistically complete sample. This study of the large-scale\n\n\f2\n\nB\u00f6hringer et al.: The REFLEX Cluster Catalogue\n\nstructure was the main objective for the construction of\nthe REFLEX sample. Several results on the construction\nof the sample (B\u00f6hringer et al. 2001a, Paper I), the assessment of the large-scale structure (Collins et al. 2000,\nPaper II; Schuecker et al. 2001a, Paper III; B\u00f6hringer et\nal. 2002, Paper IV; Schuecker et al. 2002, 2003a (Papers\nVI and VII), 2003b, Kerscher et al. 2001), on the statistics of substructure in REFLEX clusters Schuecker et al.\n(2001b), on the statistics of the cluster galaxy velocity\ndispersions (Ortiz-Gil et al. 2003), and on the X-ray temperatures of the most luminous, distant REFLEX clusters\n(Zhang et al. 2003) have already been published. Several\nfurther papers are in preparation.\nDue to the close correlation of X-ray luminosity and\nmass for clusters of galaxies (e.g. Reiprich & B\u00f6hringer\n2002) the detection and selection of the sample clusters is\ncurrently best performed through the cluster X-ray emission. The ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS), which is still\nthe only all-sky or wide-angle X-ray survey performed\nwith an imaging X-ray telescope, is by far the best basis\nfor such cosmological studies. It has been used previously\nin several projects to construct statistical galaxy cluster\nsamples (Pierre et al. 1994, Romer et al. 1994, Ebeling et\nal. 1996, 1998, 2000, Burns et al. 1996, De Grandi et al.\n1999, Ledlow et al. 1999, B\u00f6hringer et al. 2000, Henry et\nal. 2001, Cruddace et al. 2002, 2003, Ebeling et al. 2001,\n2002, Gioia et al. 2003). Part of these projects were studies\nconnected to and profiting from the REFLEX survey program. None of the previous projects covers an area in the\nsouthern sky as large as REFLEX, except for the XBACS\nAbell cluster survey (Ebeling et al. 1996), which is shallower and restricted to those clusters previously identified\nby Abell (1958) and Abell, Corwin, and Olowin (1989).\nThe REFLEX catalogue of 447 clusters provides\npresently the largest statistically complete X-ray cluster\nsample. The volume of the Universe that is probed is larger\nthan that covered by any present galaxy redshift survey\nexcept for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which goes to a\nslightly larger depth but will only cover about half the sky\narea of that covered by REFLEX, when completed.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we describe the survey and the selection characteristics. Section\n3 provides a brief description of the X-ray data reduction\nand section 4 describes the redshift determination and the\ncluster galaxy redshift statistics. The main catalogue is\npresented in section 5 and some of its properties are reviewed in section 6. In the latter section we also provide\nthe numerical data and the recipe to construct the survey\nselection function in one and two dimensions for any flux\nlimit equal to or above the nominal REFLEX flux limit.\nSection 7 gives some further information on the identification and the properties of some individual clusters. Section\n8 lists close cluster pairs and clusters with double or multiple X-ray maxima found in the REFLEX catalogue, and\nwe describe in more detail those clusters where multiple\nredshift clustering is observed in the line-of-sight of the Xray source. In section 9 we compare the results with the\npreviously derived survey samples and, finally, in section\n\nTable 1.

The REFLEX Survey\nThe construction of the REFLEX cluster sample is described in detail in paper I. The survey area covers the\nsouthern sky up to declination \u03b4 = +2.5o , avoiding the\nband of the Milky Way (|bII | \u2264 20o ) and the regions of\nthe Magellanic clouds. The total survey area is 13924 deg2\nor 4.24 sr. The regions that have been excised are defined\nin Table 2 in paper I.\nThe X-ray detection of the clusters is based on the second processing of the RASS (RASS II, Voges et al. 1999),\nproviding 54076 sources in the REFLEX area. Note that\nthe public RASS catalogue available through the internet\n(http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/rosat/survey/rass-bsc/;\nhttp://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/rosat/survey/rass-fsc/) is\nbased on the third processing of the RASS which has a\nmore complete sky coverage. Since we have frozen the\ncluster candidate list in 1998 near the end of the optical\nfollow-up program, the cluster selection of the present\ncluster catalogue is based on RASS II. We have, however,\nchecked that the X-ray properties of the individual\ncatalogued objects are still consistent with the results\nobtained with the new processing. We have in particular\nredetermined all cluster centers by applying our analysis\n\n\fB\u00f6hringer et al.: The REFLEX Cluster Catalogue\n\n3\n\nTable 2.

The positional changes were\nsmall in relation to the extent of the X-ray source. The\nsecond, enlarged version of the REFLEX sample with a\nlower flux limit will be based completely on RASS III.\nAll sources were reanalysed by means of the growth\ncurve analysis (GCA) method (B\u00f6hringer et al. 2000) and\nthe results are used to produce a flux-limited sample of\nRASS sources with a nominal flux of Fn \u2265 3 * 10\u221212 erg\ns\u22121 cm\u22122 (with Fn as defined below). This redetermination of the fluxes has been shown to be crucial for a precise measure of the fluxes of extended sources, as are the\nmajority of the REFLEX clusters (Ebeling et al. 1996,\nDe Grandi et al. 1997, B\u00f6hringer et al. 2000). Cluster\ncandidates were found using a machine based correlation\nof these X-ray sources with galaxy density enhancements\nin the COSMOS optical data base (derived from digital\nscans of the UK Schmidt survey plates by COSMOS at\nthe Royal Observatory Edinburgh (MacGillivray & Stobie\n1984, Heydon-Dumbleton et al. 1989). The resulting candidate list was carefully screened based on X-ray and op-\n\ntical information, literature data, and results from the optical follow-up observation program. The selection process\nwas designed to provide a completeness in the final cluster\ncatalogue in excess of 90% with respect to the flux-limited\nsample of GCA selected RASS sources. This high completeness of the cluster identification of the RASS sources\nensures that the selection effects introduced by the optical identification process are minimized and negligible\nfor our purpose (see also the statistics given in paper I).\nFurther tests provide support that this value of > 90%\nalso describes the the overall detection completeness of\nthe flux-limited cluster sample in the survey area. For example an independent search for X-ray emission from the\nclusters catalogued by Abell, Corwin, & Olowin (1989)\nreturns only one supplementary cluster, S567, with a flux\nabove the flux-limit that has not been included in the\nREFLEX sample. In addition tests based on the Galactic\nlatitude, redshift and photon count distribution, and on an\nindependent screening of all significantly extended RASS\nX-ray sources in the survey region, are consistent with this\nclaim (B\u00f6hringer et al. 2001, Schuecker et al. 2001). Based\non the X-ray spectral properties of the REFLEX cluster\n\n\f4\n\nB\u00f6hringer et al.: The REFLEX Cluster Catalogue\n\nsources we can also estimate that at most 9% of the X-ray\ncluster sources may have a strong X-ray flux contribution\nfrom AGN (see paper I).\nTo test further the identification of cluster candidates\nprior to the follow-up observations in La Silla, we adopted\na very conservative scheme, as described in more detail\nin paper I. To reject a source, we required it to have at\nleast two (in some combinations three) properties which\nare incompatible with a cluster identification. The properties were drawn from the following list: X-ray source is\npoint-like, X-ray source is too soft, no optical cluster visible on digitized optical images, known optical or radio\nAGN at the center of the X-ray emission. This conservative scheme made the follow-up observations somewhat\nmore expensive, but ensured a high completeness of the\nfinal catalogue.\nThe final cluster sample comprises 447 objects. The\ndistribution of these sources in the sky is shown in Figs.\n1 and 2\n\n3. Determination of the X-ray parameters\nThe X-ray count rates, fluxes, and luminosities of the\nREFLEX clusters are determined from the count rate\nmeasurements provided by the GCA (B\u00f6hringer et al.\n2000). In the first step the source count rates are integrated out to the radius where an effectively flat plateau\nof the cumulative source count curve is reached. The radius at which the plateau is reached is documented.\nTo determine the cluster X-ray flux we convert the\nmeasured count rate into a unabsorbed \"nominal\" X-ray\nflux for the ROSAT band (0.1 to 2.4 keV), Fn , by assuming a Raymond-Smith type spectrum (Raymond & Smith\n1977) for a temperature of 5 keV, a metallicity \u03b1 of 0.3\nof the solar value (Anders & Grevesse 1989), a redshift of\nzero, and an interstellar hydrogen column density given for\nthe line-of-sight in the compilation by Dickey & Lockman\n(1990), as provided within EXSAS (Zimmermann et al.\n1994). The value of Fn is used to make the flux cut independent of any redshift information (since the redshift\nis not available for all objects at the start of the survey). With the redshift value at hand, the unabsorbed\nX-ray flux is redetermined (Fx ) with an improved spectral model, where the temperature is now estimated (iteratively) from the preliminarily derived X-ray luminosity\nand the luminosity-temperature relation (uncorrected for\ncooling flow effects) derived by Markevitch (1998). The\nestimated temperature of the cluster is now taken into account, by folding the appropriate thermal spectrum with\nthe instrument response and the interstellar absorption,\nleading to a revised flux, Fx of the source (this correction\nis less than 5% for sources with an X-ray luminosity above\n4 1043 erg s\u22121 ). To obtain the cluster rest-frame luminosity from the flux, Fx we use the usual conversion with the\ncosmological luminosity distance and further scale the luminosity by the ratio of the luminosity integrated in the\nobserved, redshifted and rest frame 0.1 - 2.4 keV band.\nThe latter is equivalent to the K-correction. We note one\n\nsimplification made in the above transformation. In calculating the revised flux, Fx , we should have additionally taken the redshift effect into account by folding a\nredshifted source spectrum with the instrument response\nmatrix and interstellar absorption effect to calculate the\nexact countrate-to-flux conversion factor. We found, however, that this correction is largest for the low temperature\nobjects at high redshift and since we observe these objects\nonly at closer distances, we established that this effect\nnever becomes larger than 2% for any source in our catalogue and therefore we neglected this effect for the present\nanalysis. In the various applications of our project we have\nused the results in Tables 2 and 3 for all the necessary conversion factors. Therefore in neglecting this effect we limit\nthe necessary interpolations between observed and tabulated values to two-dimensional interpolations. This helps\nin the theoretical modeling when large parameter grids\nhave to be evaluated.\nThus, luminosities are calculated for the rest frame energy band 0.1 to 2.4 keV. We also account for the X-ray\nflux missed outside the detection aperture by the following\ncorrection. We correct the fluxes and luminosities based on\na self-similar cluster model as described in B\u00f6hringer et\nal. (2000): a \u03b2-model (Cavaliere & Fusco-Femiano 1976)\nwith a \u03b2-value of 2/3, a core radius that scales with mass,\nand an assumed extent of the X-ray halo out to 12 times\nthe core radius. The correction procedure has been successfully tested by simulations based on the same cluster\nmodel. The typical mean correction factor is about 8%\nwith the largest corrections of up to 30% occuring for the\nnearby groups which are extended and have a low surface\nbrightness (B\u00f6hringer et al. 2000). Note that in contrast\nto our convention of extrapolating the corrected total flux\nout to the estimated virial radius, Ebeling et al. (1996,\n1998) and De Grandi et al. (1999) extrapolate their flux\ncorrections to infinity. The difference between the two approaches - which uses the same \u03b2-model with a slope of\n2/3 - is 8.3%. Nevertheless the agreement between the results of, for example, Ebeling et al. (1998) and the results\nof B\u00f6hringer et al. (2000) have been found to show a bias\nsmaller than this difference. We attribute this to the fact\nthat the GCA method is capturing slightly more of the\ncluster flux than the other methods.\nTo allow the reader to easily and fully reproduce our\npresent results and the results on the cosmological implications of the REFLEX project published in other papers of this series, without having to resort to ROSAT\ninstrument specific calculations, we provide here all the\nconversion tables used in the flux and luminosity determination described above. In the underlaying calculations\nwe were aiming for an accuracy of better than about 2-3%\n(e.g. in the energy dependent vignetting correction, the\ntested difference between calculations with different radiation codes), so that the errors from the conversion factors\nis in any case negligible compared to the measurement errors.

A graphical\nrepresentation of this function for three selected temperatures can be found in B\u00f6hringer et al.

Table 5\nprovides the conversion from the ROSAT band (0.1 - 2.4\nkeV) to the bolometric system. The print version of the\n\npaper gives only a few example lines for Tables 2 through\n5. The full tables can be obtained from the electronic version of the paper.\n\n4. Redshift determination\nFor cluster candidates with published redshifts we adopted\nthe following procedure to obtain the final redshift. The\nsearch for redshift information in the literature was conducted with an aperture radius of 7 arcmin for more distant clusters and the search radius was increased to half\nthe virial radius (half the virial radius was taken to be\n5 times the core radius estimated from LX as described\nin B\u00f6hringer et al. 2000) if this radius was larger than 7\narcmin. This is of course an iterative process in which a\nfirst redshift result was chosen for which the search radius\nwas calculated and then a refined search for cluster galaxy\nmembers was performed in NED. This was found to be\nvery important for the nearby clusters where an increasing\nnumber of redshifts becomes available from large redshift\nsurveys which help greatly in improving the cluster red-\n\n\f6\n\nB\u00f6hringer et al.: The REFLEX Cluster Catalogue\n\nFig. 2. The same sky distribution of REFLEX clusters as shown in Fig. 2, but now the symbols indicate the cluster\ndistance. The clusters are sorted into five redshift classes: z = 0 \u2212 0.05, z = 0.05 \u2212 0.1, z = 0.1 \u2212 0.15, z = 0.15 \u2212 0.2,\nand z \u2265 0.2 indicated by decreasing symbol size with increasing redshift. The three largest symbol classes are shown\nas open circles to avoid shading of other clusters. In this plot superstructures can be recognized.

For more details on these superstructures see Einasto et al. (2001).\nshifts. The final redshift taken was the cluster redshift that\ninvolved the largest number of galaxy redshifts. If no reliable cluster redshift was available, the cluster redshift was\ncomputed from the median of individual galaxy redshifts\nlocated within the aperture radius around the central target position after the rejection of obvious non-members of\nthe cluster. The secondary line-of-sight clustering found\nfor a number of REFLEX clusters is further described in\nsection 8. The present literature redshift compilation is\nlargely based on information requested from NED in July\n2003.\nCluster candidates without published redshifts or reliable identification were observed from 1992 to 1999 within\na large ESO key programme (B\u00f6hringer et al. 1998, Guzzo\net al. 1999). For a detailed spectroscopic follow-up we used\nfor the brighter objects the ESO 1.5m with the Boller &\nChivens spectrograph and the ESO 2.2m with the EFOSC2 instrument. For the more distant and thus fainter objects\n\nthe ESO 3.6m telescope with the EFOSC-1 (later EFOSC2) instrument was used. This instrument was preferentially used in multi-object spectroscopic mode, but also\nlong-slit spectra were taken with EFOSC for some of the\nclusters. If necessary we also performed CCD imaging in\norder to test for galaxy overdensities in the target direction. A detailed description of the observing strategy,\nthe reduction of the spectra, redshift measurements, astrometry, and morphological classification is in preparation (Guzzo et al. 2003, in preparation). A brief summary\nis given below.\nThe main goal of the follow-up observations was to\nget for each X-ray cluster candidate at least five spectra,\nwhich we found was enough for a first identification of the\nX-ray source and for a good estimate of the cluster redshift. This comparatively small number of spectra results\nfrom the fact that the optical follow-up could be restricted\nto the location of the X-ray peak, that is, to the region\n\n\fB\u00f6hringer et al.: The REFLEX Cluster Catalogue\n\n7\n\nTable 4.

In order\nto optimize the efficiency of cluster identification and redshift measurement, for clusters with a few bright (nearby)\ngalaxies, spectra were observed in the single-slit mode,\nwhereas for clusters with many faint galaxies the multislit mode was chosen. The multi-slit mode gives spectra\nfor about 10-25 galaxies, so that for many clusters we also\nhave information about the velocity dispersion (Ortiz-Gil\net al. 2003).\nFig. 3 shows the cumulative distribution of the\nREFLEX clusters with a number of member galaxy redshifts greater than the given limit. Indeed about half of the\nclusters have 5 or more galaxy redshifts and the derived\nredshift is fairly secure. However, about 42 clusters feature only one galaxy redshift, mostly values coming from\nthe literature. The available observation time budget for\nthis project did not allow for a redetermination of all the\n\nliterature values. Still most of these data yield a reliable,\nas they refer to the central brightest cluster galaxy at the\ncenter of the X-ray emission. For 8 clusters in the catalogue we were so far not able to find the information in\nthe literature on the number of galaxies from which the\ncluster redshift was determined.\nThe majority of spectra were reduced in a standard\nmanner (bias and flat field correction, wavelength calibration) using procedures from the IRAF software package.\nCosmics were rejected from the combination of at least two\nspectral exposures obtained for each spectral observation.\nAll spectra were visually classified into the categories elliptical galaxy, spiral galaxy, Seyfert 1/2 galaxy, quasar,\nstarforming galaxy (tentatively), and stellar. Heliocentric\nredshifts were determined from cross-correlation with a\nsample of 17 template spectra with spectral types covering the large range usually found in clusters of galaxies\nand in the field. In addition, redshifts were also determined from emission lines (if present), including a measurement of their equivalent widths. The final redshifts of\nthe clusters were obtained from the median of the measured galaxy redshifts after the rejection of obvious nonmembers. The criterion for the assignment of the cluster\nmembership was a maximum velocity deviation of 3000\nkm s\u22121 from the median.\nAll optical and X-ray information is collected and organized in a data base which we are planing to make publicly\navailable. A more detailed account of the optical data will\nbe given in a forthcoming paper listing in particular the\nindividual galaxy redshifts determined in this ESO key\nprogram (Guzzo et al.)\n\n\f8\n\nB\u00f6hringer et al.: The REFLEX Cluster Catalogue\n\n5.

Note that the core radii determined\nhere are only a qualitative measure for the source extent,\nsince the errors are very large and the fitting grid was\ncoarsely spaced. Therefore core radii and their lower limiting values can give a further qualitative feeling for the\nextent of the X-ray sources, but we recommend not to\nuse these results for rc as a quantitative measure of\ncluster shapes at this point.

Column (13) indicates\nthe deviation of the measured hardness ratio from the expectation value calculated for given NH and for an assumed temperature of 5 keV as factors of \u03c3. The last column (14) repeats from Table 6 the aperture radius within\nwhich the source count rate was measured, but now in\nphysical units of Mpc. This is the radius where the cumulative source count rate profile reaches the plateau value.\nThe print version of this paper gives only a few example\nlines of this table. The full table as well as a second version of Table 6 for an Einstein-de Sitter Universe model is\nprovided in the electronic version.\nThe probability of an X-ray source to be a point source,\nas given in column (5) was determined by means of a\nKolmogorov-Smirnov test comparing the normalized radially cumulative photon distribution within an aperture\nradius of 6 arcmin with the expectations for a point source\nand background. In this test we consider a source to be\nsignificantly extended if the probability is less than 1%,\ncorresponding to an entry value in Table 7 larger than 2.\nThe source hardness ratio, as given in column (8), was determined from the source count rate in the soft (ROSAT\nPSPC channel 11 to 40) and hard (PSPC channel 52 to\n201) band by the formula:\n\nHR =\n\nH \u2212S\nH +S\n\nwhere H is the hard band and S the soft band count\nrate.\nFigure 1 shows the sky distribution of the REFLEX\nclusters with five different X-ray flux classes marked by\ndifferent symbols. The empty region around RA = 75 deg\n(5 hr) and DEC = \u221270 deg is due to the excision of the\nregions of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. Fig. 2\nshows the same sky distribution but now with the clusters\nsorted in five different redshift classes. This illustrates the\nlarge scale clustering of the clusters, and several known\nsuperclusters are marked.\n\n\fB\u00f6hringer et al.: The REFLEX Cluster Catalogue\n\n9\n\nTable 6.

Selection properties of the cluster sample\nA number of tests in papers I through III demonstrate\nthe quality of the catalogue, in particular the completeness and homogeneity. For example through the LogNlogS distribution, a V /Vmax -test, and the photon number distribution, do not indicate a significant deficiency\nat faint fluxes or low source photon numbers. The sample\nshows a large scale density homogeneity at least out to\nz = 0.15 with pronounced traces of large scale structure\non scales smaller than the sample size (paper III). The\ntwo-point correlation function (paper II) shows a good\noverall isotropy (except for possibly small dynamical redshift distortion effects which are expected and currently\ninvestigated) and the number count distribution on large\nscales (\u2265 50h\u22121 Mpc) is approximately Gaussian (paper\nIV). We do not see any significant bias in the cluster density as a function of Galactic latitude or longitude (papers II and III). Here we provide another test, showing\nthe cluster density as a function of interstellar absorption.\nFig. 4 shows the surface density of clusters averaged over\n0.5 1020 cm\u22122 column density intervals and compares it\nto the distribution of NH over the sky. The density is almost constant within the formal Poissonian errors (which\ndo not include fluctuations from large-scale structure and\ncosmic variance) up to the region where the statistics becomes too poor and the expectation value drops below\none or two. Since the column density as well as the stellar density, which hampers the cluster identification, increases with decreasing |b|, we are also testing here the\nbias in the optical cluster identification due to crowding\nof the sky fields near the Galactic plane and find no major effect. These plots have to be compared with similar\ntests conducted with the optically identified clusters in the\nAbell catalogue (e.g. Ebeling et al. 1996).\nAnother mark of quality of the REFLEX cluster identification is the fact that the vast majority of the clusters,\n79.5%, have been identified as extended sources.

Two major factors\nmodify the depth of our survey as a function of sky position: the RASS exposure time and the interstellar column\ndensity in the line-of-sight. We model the sensitivity function which depends on these two parameters in the following way: we calculate the flux limit reached per number\nof photons specified to be required for secure source detection. In this sense Table 8 gives the sky area in the\nREFLEX survey for a given flux limit for the detection of\none photon. This sky coverage table is for example used\nin the calculation of the luminosity function in paper IV,\nwhere we assume conservatively that at least 30 photons\nare detected for the cluster.

Sky density of the REFLEX clusters as a function\nof the Galactic hydrogen column density (solid line) in\nunits of deg2 multiplied by a factor of 20000. The dotted\nline gives the sky area distribution of NH values in units\nof deg2 for 0.5 * 1020 cm\u22122 bins.\nreaches the nominal flux limit of the REFLEX survey of\n3 * 10\u221212 erg s\u22121 cm \u22122 . Note also, that this excludes some\nclusters in the catalogue with less than 30 source photon counts from the analysis. For the large-scale structure\nanalysis in paper III we have included more clusters for\na better three-dimensional coverage and relaxed the detection requirement to 10 source photons. In this case the\nREFLEX survey reaches the nominal flux limit in 97% of\nthe survey area, which corresponds to a more simple survey window function in k-space for the determination of\nthe density fluctuation power spectrum.\n\nFig. 5. LogN-LogS distribution of the REFLEX clusters.\nThe upper curve shows all the clusters while the lower,\ndashed curve shows the 79.5% fraction of significantly extended sources as measured with the KS test for the survey\npoint spread function.\nFor the large-scale structure modeling, e.g. for the construction of the comparison Poisson sample used in the\nevaluation of the two-point correlation function or the density distribution power spectrum, the sensitivity limit as\na function of the sky position has to be known. This has\nbeen constructed from the exposure map of the RASS2\nproduct and the 21 cm maps from Dickey & Lockman\n(1990) and Stark et al. (1992), and is given in a similar\nway in Table 9. In fact Table 8 is only a cumulative account\nof Table 9. The table gives the sensitivity distribution on\na roughly one square degree grid. It lists also the exposure and interstellar column density distribution used in\nthe calculation. For both tables only a few example lines\nare given in the print version of the paper, but the full\ntables (which in case of Table 9 consists of 13902 lines)\nare provided in the electronic version of the paper and on\nour home page given above.\n\n7. Information on individual Objects\nThe REFLEX data base used for the cosmology work in\nthe REFLEX papers up to number VIII is based on the\ncatalogue version of 1999. As we have collected more information since, we went through a further critical inspection\nof all the catalogue entries prior to the release of this catalogue, in addition to the revision of redshifts as described\nabove. A major route of approach was to carefully assess\nthe nature of those objects for which the X-ray criteria\nleft us with a not very satisfactory means of identification. Thus we inspected especially all those X-ray sources\nagain which appeared point-like in the RASS. The fact\nthat an X-ray source appears point-like at the resolution\nof the All-Sky Survey is not yet a criterion to reject a\nsource. An illustrative example for this is the massive,\nand optically very impressive cluster RXCJ1206.2-0848 at\nredshift z = 0.4414 which appears in the RASS as a point\n\n\f16\n\nB\u00f6hringer et al.: The REFLEX Cluster Catalogue\n\nTable 10.

On the other hand,\nif an X-ray source is clearly well extended, we can be sure\nthat most of the X-ray emission is diffuse and the contribution to the X-ray flux from AGNs or radio galaxies\nfound at other wavelength can at most be a minor fraction. In addition to the X-ray based reinspection we have\nalso screened again the literature for any information that\ncould cast doubts on the cluster identification, with a special eye on contaminating AGN. One source of further\nobservational information that was used for some clusters\nare pointed observations with the ROSAT PSPC and HRI\ndetector as well as new observations with XMM-Newton\nand CHANDRA.\nAs a result of this screening procedure we could improve our identification and discarded 6 objects from the\nREFLEX list as described in the subsection below. We\nshould also point out that most of the critical cases commented below were known as problematic targets to our\nobserving team at the time of the observation. One of the\nobservational requirements was therefore to take a spectrum of suspicious objects in the center of the X-ray emission (often bright galaxies) to critically check for the presence of an AGN. More details about the spectra of these\nobjects will be given in Guzzo et al. (in preparation). Thus\nfor some of the objects where the identification is still not\ncompletely certain the standard optical means have already been used and a final decision can only come from a\nhigh angular resolution X-ray observation or for example\nfrom optical polarimetric measurements. In total we are\nleft with 14 cases where the identification is not definitive.\nFollowing our previous philosophy to keep the objects in\nour working list until we can positively rule them out as\ncluster identifications, we have conservatively kept them\nin our catalogue but we have marked them in the table.\nWe realistically expect that less than 10 are non-cluster\nobjects. The effect this small fraction (less than 2.3 %)\nhas on any of the cosmological applications of REFLEX\nis completely negligible.\nIn the following we provide notes on the results of our\ninspection including the critica cases mentioned as well as\npositive confirmations. These remarks should be of help\nfor any further identification or follow-up work that may\nbe conducted on these REFLEX objects. The comments\ngiven for each object illustrate some aspects of the manual\nscreening process.\nRXCJ0014.3-6604, A2746 (also included in\nXBACS) is a typical example of a point-like X-ray source\nwhich was inspected in more detail. The X-ray spectral\nhardness ratio is not outside the acceptable limit for\ncluster emission. The source appears very compact with\na core radius 2\u03c3 upper limit of about 120h\u22121\n50 kpc at\na redshift of z = 0.156. This does not rule out that\nthe X-ray emission comes from a cluster. We have five\nconcordant redshifts including the cD galaxy, with no\nspectrum indicating an AGN and the optical image is\nclearly showing a galaxy cluster. Therefore, even though\n\n19\n\nwe cannot establish the extent of the X-ray source, we\nconclude that the source is most likely a cluster.\nRXCJ0015.4-2350, A14, has an X-ray emission\nwhich is very faint and diffuse: about 48 source photons\nspread in a clumpy distribution over a region with a radius\nof about 12 arcmin. The cluster position was not taken as\nthe center of the large-scale distribution but at a local\nmaximum. The cD galaxy, ESO 473-G 005 at the position 00 15 10.6, -23 52 57.0 is located at this highest local\nmaximum. This is surely a good example of a dynamically young cluster with a size slightly smaller than the\nVirgo cluster. Even though there is a slight probability\nthat the X-ray emission originates from a collection of\npoint sources, by far the most likely interpretation is that\nof a poor galaxy cluster. This is supported by the finding\nof four coincident galaxy redshift in the optical follow-up.\nRXCJ0117.8-5455 is another source with X-ray\nemission consistent with a point source origin. The source\nis also detected as a bright radio source in the SUMSS\nsurvey (Mauch et al. 2003). Since the cluster is found to\nbe at a redshift of z = 0.2510 as determined from 6 galaxy\nvelocities (where none of the spectra indicate an AGN),\nan upper limit on the X-ray core radius of about 270 h\u22121\n50\nkpc is consistent with a cluster source and also the spectral hardness ratio is within the limits expected for cluster\nemission. Therefore this point-like X-ray source is kept in\nthe catalogue until we have better data for a more secure\nidentification.\nRXCJ0132.6-0804 is classified as Seyfert 1.5 in the\ncross correlation work of the ROSAT All-Sky Survey and\nthe NVSS sources by Bauer et al. (2000). We find narrow emission lines in the central galaxy, PKS 0130-083, of\nthis cluster at z = 0.1485. The OIII lines are more prominent than the H\u03b2 lines which makes the AGN identification more likely than that of the typcail emission lines\noften found in central cluster galaxies in cooling core clusters (e.g. Crawfrord et al. 1999). The X-ray luminosity of\nthe object is about 3.6 1044 erg s\u22121 which is quite high\nfor a Seyfert galaxy. The Digital Sky Survey image shows\nclearly a central dominant galaxy surrounded by a collection of galaxies and we recorded three coincident galaxy\nredshifts. The spectral hardness ratio is within the limits\nexpected for thermal emission from a cluster. Therefore\nthe identification of this X-ray source is uncertain at this\nstage. The X-ray emission could come from the cluster or\nthe AGN. A high resolution X-ray observation is required\nfor a definitive decision.\nRXCJ0250.2-2129 has been classified as a BL Lac\n(z = 0.4980, off-set 0.4 arcmin) in the ROSAT Bright\nSource Catalogue by Schwope et al. (2000) and is listed as\na radio source in Bauer et al. (2000). The BL Lac is not at\nthe same redshift as the cluster. The X-ray source shows\na marginal extent and is too soft by about 1.3\u03c3 compared\nto the expectation. Our deeper CCD image clearly shows\nan optical cluster and we found two coincident galaxy redshifts. We therefore take the cluster identification as more\nlikely, but cannot rule out a contribution to the X-ray\nemission by the AGN. The cluster is also coverd by a\n\n\f20\n\nB\u00f6hringer et al.: The REFLEX Cluster Catalogue\n\nFig. 6. Surface brightness profile of the REFLEX cluster\nRXCJ0301.6+0155 as observed in a pointed observation\nwith the ROSAT HRI (data points and Poissonian errors).\nThe profile is compared to the point spread function of the\nROSAT HRI (solid line).\n\nROSAT PSPC archive observation. But the offset from\nthe pointing center is so large that the possibility to better resolve a point source is not improved over the survey\ndata.\nRXCJ0301.6+0155 This source, which has previously been identified as a cluster in the NORAS Survey\n(B\u00f6hringer et al. 2000) and which is coinciding with a\nZwicky cluster (ZwCl0258.9+01), appears point-like. A\nROSAT HRI observation in the archive showed that the\nsource is very compact but definitely not a point source.\nTherefore the cluster identification is well justified. The\ncomparison between the surface brightness profile and the\npoint spread function of the ROSAT HRI is shown in\nFig. 6.\nRXCJ0331.1-2100 is coincident within 0.5 arcmin\nwith a Seyfert 1.9 galaxy identified by Bauer et al. (2000).\nThe source is listed in Schwope et al. (2000) as RBS 0436.\nThe X-ray emission is only marginally extended, but the\nspectral hardness ratio is consistent with thermal intracluster medium emission. We have nine coincident galaxy\nredshifts for this cluster. Therefore it is possible that the\nAGN is contaminating the X-ray radiation, but there is\nalso definitely a cluster at this position.\nRXCJ0336.3-0347 This is a compact X-ray source\nwith a peaked center and a weak extent. The central\ngalaxy is listed as an AGN, as 2MASS and radio source,\nprobably a BL Lac at z = 0.1595 (Bauer et al. 2000,\nVeron-Cetty & Veron 2001). It appears to have a bright\ncentral spot in sky images, but our spectra also easily show\nthe underlaying galaxy continuum with the Balmer break.\nThe optical image also shows an optical cluster for which\nwe have three concordant redshifts at the same redshift\nas the AGN. The most likely interpretation of this source\nis that it is indeed a galaxy cluster with some (less than\nhalf) contamination of the X-ray emission by the AGN.\n\nThe hardness ratio of the X-ray emission is consistent with\na cluster, also.\nRXCJ0425.8-0833 is coincident within 1.3 arcmin\nwith a Seyfert 2 galaxy identified by Hewitt & Burbidge\n(1991). The source is listed in Schwope et al. (2000) as\nRBS 0540. The central dominant galaxy has the spectrum of a passive ellitpical galaxy without emission lines\nas found in our follow-up observations. The X-ray emission is very extended and the dominant part of the X-ray\nemission must come from the cluster, for which we have\ntwo concordant redshifts.\nRXCJ0437.1-2027, A499, is detected with only 26\nphotons and the result for the extent is not completely\nconvincing. A ROSAT HRI observation from the archive\nshows that the source is quite compact but clearly extended. Two coincident galaxy redshifts are available for\nthis cluster.\nRXCJ0528.9-3927 also identified as RBS0653\n(Schwope et al. 2000) is listed in NED as a QSO. The\nX-ray emission is slightly extended but the spectral hardness ratio deviates by 5.2\u03c3 from the value expected for\nthermal cluster emission. A deeper X-ray observatio with\nXMM-Newton shows this object to be an X-ray luminous\ncluster with a less than 20% contamination (in the ROSAT\nhard band) by a bright, soft AGN point source.\nRXCJ0918.1-1205, A780 or Hydra A, is a well\nknown X-ray cluster. Thus even though one finds a coincidence within 0.2 arcmin with a Seyfert galaxy listed\nby de Vaucouleurs et al. (1991), there is no doubt about\nthe clear dominance of the thermal cluster emission.\nRXCJ1027.9-0647, A1023, is coincident within 0.2\narcmin with an AGN at z = 0.1165 identified by Grazian\net al. (2002). The X-ray emission is marginally extended\nand the spectral hardness ratio is consistent with thermal\ncluster emission. There is a residual possibility that the Xray emission of this source is contaminated by an AGN.\nSix coincident galaxy redshifts support the existence of a\ngalaxy cluster at this position.\nRXCJ1050.5-0236, A1111, is coincident within 0.6\narcmin with a Seyfert 2 galaxy identified by Machalski\n& Condon (1999). The X-ray emission is found to be extended and the dominant part of the X-ray emission comes\nfrom the cluster. There is an X-ray emitting star in the\nsouth of the cluster whose X-ray emission was deblended.\nNine coincident galaxy redshifts leave no doubt about the\nexistence of a cluster at this position (see also the ASCA\nstudy of Matsumoto et al. 2001).\nRXCJ1050.6-2405 features a point source and an\nextended fainter halo in the RASS. About one third of\nthe flux seems to come from the central compact emission.\nThe hardness ratio gives no indication for two source components, however, and is perfectly consistent with thermal emission from a cluster. At the cluster redshift of\nz = 0.2037 the compact center could still be a bright\ncompact cluster cooling core as well as a contaminating\ncentral AGN. Near the center (0.4 arcmin offset) is a radio source, PKS B1048-238 (MRC1048-238), at a redshift\nof z = 0.2060 (McCarthy et al. 1996) and identified with\n\n\fB\u00f6hringer et al.: The REFLEX Cluster Catalogue\n\na broad line radio galaxy Kapahi et al. (1998). We expect\nthat most of the X-ray emission is due to the cluster. But\nso far we have made no effort to subtracted the possible\nAGN contribution.\nRXCJ1141.4-1216, A1348, is coincident within 0.2\narcmin with a Seyfert 1.8 galaxy listed by Machalski &\nCondon (1999). The X-ray emission shows a small extent\nand the X-ray emission is slightly softer (\u223c 2.9\u03c3) than\nexpected. From the extended X-ray emission we still conclude that most of the emission comes from the cluster.\nThe X-ray luminosity of the object is 3.3 * 1044 erg s\u22121\nwhich would be towards the upper end of the luminosity distribution of Seyfert galaxies. Six coincident galaxy\nredshifts confirm the existence of a cluster at this position.\nRXCJ1149.7-1219, A1391, is coincident within 0.9\narcmin with an AGN listed by Machalski & Condon\n(1999). The X-ray emission is found to be clearly extended\nand the dominant part of the X-ray emission must come\nfrom the cluster. Six coincident galaxy redshifts confirm\nthe existence of a cluster at this position.\nRXCJ1212.3-1816 was detected with only 12.5\nsource photons with a significance of just about 3\u03c3. This\nsignal is detected in an aperture significantly larger than\nthe point spread function and the significance decreases\nfor a smaller detection cell. Therefore, if the detection is\naccepted, the source has to be extended. We have two coincident cluster galaxy redshifts.\nRXCJ1234.2-3856 appears as a point source in\nRASS with a spectral hardness ratio consistent with thermal cluster emission. It is also listed as a radio source\nwithout classification by Bauer et al. (2000). Two coincident galaxy redshifts give some further support for the\ncluster identification.\nRXCJ1253.6-3931 appears as point-like source in\nthe RASS with a cluster like hardness ratio and coincides\nwithin 0.5 arcmin with the unclassified radio source PMN\nJ1253-3932 (see also Bauer et al. 2000). We have a spectrum as well as a redshift from the central galaxy which\ndoes not show an AGN or BL Lac signature. A CCD image shows a galaxy cluster. Therefore we keep this source\nin our list as a likely cluster candidate.\nRXCJ1326.2+0013 is coincident within 0.2 arcmin\nwith a BL Lac found in the 2dF survey. The X-ray emission is clearly extended and the emission from the intracluster medium certainly dominates. The spectral hardness ratio is as expected and there are 16 coincident galaxy\nredshift. Therefore there is no doubt about the cluster\nidentification of this source.\nRXCJ1332.9-2519 is detected in the RASS with very\nlow surface brightness, but with 50 counts and an about\n4\u03c3 detection. An archival PSPC observation, with an exposure of only 982 sec shows a similar very low surface\nbrightness structure providing a good confirmation of this\nvery diffuse structure. We have three coincident galaxy\nredshifts from the follow-up observations confirming the\nexistence of a cluster at this position.\nRXCJ1347.2-3025 & RXCJ1349.3-3018, A 3574\nor Klemola 27 at a redshifts of 0.0145 and 0.0160, re-\n\n21\n\nspectively, is a cluster with two components. It presents\na particular problem to its detection and identification.\nThe central galaxy is the X-ray luminous Seyfert 1 galaxy,\nIC 4329, and two further AGNs contribute to the X-ray\nemission from the cluster region. While the central detection could easily have been dismissed because of its almost\npoint-like appearance in the RASS and its identification\nwith a known X-ray AGN, the additional detection of fragments of the diffuse outer emission in the RASS analysis\ntriggered a further inspection of this cluster. A pointed observation shows clearly the diffuse X-ray halo of the cluster in addition to the three cluster AGN point sources. We\nhave used this pointed observation to subtract the contribution of the three AGN from the total emission. The central AGN IC4329A carries about 75% of the flux, the two\nother AGNs contribute about 4 to 5% each and the cluster emission amounts to 15 - 20%. Therefore, with a net\nflux of \u223c 1.35 10\u221211 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 in the ROSAT band,\nthe cluster is well above the flux limit of the REFLEX\nand the XBACS survey. Fig. 7 shows the surface brightness distribution of this cluster. In the catalogue we have\nlisted the central cluster region and the western concentration (about 25 arcmin, \u223c 0.6 Mpc distance) as separate\nsources identified with A3574E and A3574W, respectively,\nrecognizing that they are two separate virializing clumps.\nAlso the diffuse Western component is, with a nominal\nflux, Fn \u223c 3.5 10\u221212 erg s\u22121 cm \u22122 , above the REFLEX\nflux limit.\nThe cluster properties were determined also with the\nhelp of the pointed observation, which allows a better\ncontamination subtraction. The cluster was dismissed in\nXBACS as an AGN. At a larger distance it would probably have escaped its identification as a cluster in REFLEX.\nThis shows that there is probably not only a small fraction\nof clusters which are erroneously included in the sample\nbecause of an AGN contribution to the X-ray flux, but\nalso a small fraction of clusters which are erroneously discarded because the cluster X-ray emission is not easily\nvisible if it is blended by a bright AGN.\nRXCJ1350.7-3343 has a central galaxy with a\nSeyfert 1 spectrum but the X-ray emission in RASS is\nextended and therefore indicates a galaxy cluster.\nRXCJ1415.2-0030, tentatively identified with\nA1882 (offset 13.3 arcmin), is coincident within 1.6\narcmin with a QSO identified in the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey. The X-ray emission is very extended and diffuse,\nhowever, and we do not detect a contribution by a point\nsource. 20 concordant redshifts confirm the existence of a\ncluster.\nRXCJ1416.8-1158 appears as a point source in\nRASS and has a spectrum that is 1.7\u03c3 too soft. 10 coincident galaxy redshift give good support for the existence\nof a cluster at this position.\nRXCJ1504.1-0248 is a very peculiar object. We have\nobtained a spectrum of the central galaxy (with an offset\nof 0.3 arcmin from our reference position of the cluster)\nwhich shows Liner like emission lines. It was identified as\nan AGN by Shectman et al. (1996). The X-ray source is\n\n\f22\n\nB\u00f6hringer et al.: The REFLEX Cluster Catalogue\n\nFig. 7. ROSAT PSPC image of Abell 3574 (RXCJ1347.23025 & RXCJ1349.3-3018) from a pointed PSPC observation with an exposure of 8.3 ksec. The image is exposure and vignetting corrected. It has been treated with a\nvariable Gaussian filter. The contours are logarithmically\nspaced. We can see two bright point sources in the center and another one to the south which carry most of the\nflux received from this object. The diffuse emission of the\ncluster shows some clumpiness and amounts to about 20%\nof the total emission. The central part and the Western\nsubcluster are tabulated as two different catalogue entries.\nOne sky pixel is 0.5 arcsec, thus the image size is 42 \u00d7 42\narcmin2 . The image is centered on the sky coordinate 13\n49 19.2, -30 18 36 (J2000).\nvery compact but significantly extented (the probability\nthat the emission comes from a point source is estimated\nto be 0.0016). The X-ray luminosity is extremely high with\nLx \u223c 4.3 * 1045 erg s\u22121 in the 0.1 - 2.4 keV band and not\ntypical for a narrow line AGN.\nA short CHANDRA observation that was finally performed early 2004 shows a perfect galaxy cluster image\nwithout any significant AGN contamination. This is in our\nsample the most spectacular example of an object which\nwas for long time marked as very suspicious for its unusual compactness for given brightness and distance but\nwas finally revealed to be a prominet X-ray cluster. The\nLiner-like spectrum observed for the central galaxy is also\ntypical for cooling flow clusters (e.g. Crawford et al. 1999\nand references theirin).\nRXCJ1958.2-3011 is an X-ray source that appears\npoint-like in RASS with a hardness ratio consistent with\ncluster emission. It is listed as an unclassified radio source\nin Bauer et al. (2000). The optical image shows a galaxy\nwith a bright nucleus and our ESO spectrum indicates an\nenhanced blue continuum. There is clearly a cluster visible\nwith a likely Bright Cluster Galaxy (BCG) that is about\n1 arcmin offset to the NEE from the radio source and the\ncenter of the cluster emission. The cluster detection is further supported by four concordant redshifts. Therefore, we\n\nclassify this object as a cluster-AGN combination whose\nfluxes must be determined by a higher angular resolution\nX-ray image. Since low X-ray luminosity AGN appear very\nfrequently in clusters, with an X-ray luminosity well below that of the cluster emission, we keep this object in the\nREFLEX catalogue at present.\nRXCJ2035.7-2513 shows diffuse X-ray emission\naround a large early type galaxy with a luminosity of\nabout 4 1042 erg s\u22121 . An archival PSPC image also shows\nthe diffuse emission but also some contamination of 1020% by point sources, which is within the error of the\nflux determination in the catalogue and no correction has\nbeen made. The object is probably associated with A3698\nwhose center has an offset of 4.6 arcmin assumed to coincide with NGC 6936. Seven coincident galaxy redshifts\nconfirm the existence of a cluster at the X-ray source position.\nRXCJ2147.0-1019 contains a BL Lac identified by\nBauer et al. (2000) within 0.2 arcmin of our reference position. The X-ray source is marginally extended (probability 97%) and has a hardness ratio well consistent with\nthermal cluster emission. We cannot rule out that the BL\nLac could substantially contribute to the cluster emission,\nhowever.\nRXCJ2216.9-1725 contains a Seyfert galaxy identified by Schwope et al. (2000) within 0.2 arcmin of our reference position. The X-ray source is marginally extended\n(probability 90%) and the X-ray hardness ration shows\nthat the source is about 2\u03c3 too soft. Therefore, it is not\nimpossible that the Seyfert galaxy contributes to the Xray emission. The cluster is with an X-ray luminosity of\nLx \u223c 4 * 1044 erg s\u22121 so luminous that the Seyfert galaxy\nhas to be relatively bright to affect the total flux.\nRXCJ2220.5-3509, A3866, has an AGN found in our\nspectroscopic follow-up 40 arcsec from the X-ray center\nat z = 0.0754. The X-ray emission shows a small but\nsignificant extent, but the core of the emission looks like\na point source. The cluster redshift is measured as z =\n0.1544 and the optical image shows a nice cluster with a\ndominant giant galaxy close to the X-ray maximum. We\nexpect that the X-ray emission from the cluster is partly\ncontaminated by the AGN.\nRXCJ2234.5-3744, A3888, is a cluster in which we\nalso detected a Seyfert 1 galaxy within 2 arcmin from\nthe center (A. K. Romer, Ph.D. Thesis). Therefore, there\nwas some concern about the X-ray contamination from\nthe AGN in this source. An XMM-Newton observation\n(P.I. A.C. Edge) allows us to distinguish the cluster and\nAGN X-ray emission. We find that the AGN contribution\nis about 10% of the total emission in the 0.5 - 2.0 keV\nband. 70 coincident galaxy redshifts confirm the existence\nof a cluster at this position.\nRXCJ2251.7-3206 is an X-ray source that appears\npoint-like in RASS with a hardness ratio which is too soft\nby about 2.9\u03c3 compared to the expectation for cluster\nemission. It has been found to be a radio source (Bauer\net al. 2000) classified as a BL Lac (Schwope et al. 2000).\nWe have one galaxy redshift for this cluster. The question\n\n\fB\u00f6hringer et al.: The REFLEX Cluster Catalogue\n\nif it is an X-ray BL Lac or an X-ray cluster is undecided.\nThis is to be clarified by further observations.\nRXCJ2351.6-2605 contains an AGN within 0.2 arcmin of our reference position identified by Caccianiga et\nal. (2000). The X-ray source is, however, extended with\nhigh significance, and the X-ray hardness ratio is perfectly\nconsistent with thermal emission from a cluster. We do not\ndetect a signature of point source contribution. Therefore,\nthe identification of this X-ray source as a cluster is safe\ninspite of the coincidence with the AGN.\nFor some of the objects in this list, where the central\ncluster galaxy is identified with an AGN because of the\nobservation of emission lines, the emission lines could also\nbe associated to the cluster cooling core. Emission lines\nwith preferentially low excitation energies are frequently\nobserved in cooling core clusters (e.g. Crawford et al. 1999\nand references therein). In these cases the dominant Xray emission comes from the cluster and its cooling core.\nTherefore the observation of emission lines in the central\ncluster galaxies does not cast doubts on the cluster identification in general.\n\n7.1. Objects removed from the present catalogue at\nfinal inspection\nIn the final two observing runs a number of cluster candidates were observed which had been flagged to be weak\ncluster candidates. A large fraction of them turned out to\nbe clusters at the telescope and were therefore included in\nthe catalogue. Now, during this final inspection a few of\nthem turn out to be most probably optical clusters with\na dominant X-ray AGN. In the following we list these 7\nobjects which were excluded from our catalogue.\nRXCJ0730.8-6602 looks like a point source. The\ncentral galaxy with a redshift of z = 0.1063 could be an\nAGN; it has a bright core in the optical image. While the\nDSS image shows a trace of a promising galaxy grouping at the center of the X-ray position, a deeper R-band\nCCD did not confirm the presence of a rich enough cluster.\nThe Parks 4.85 GHz survey lists a 84 mJy radio source,\nPMN0730-6602, (Griffith & Wright 1993) and the SUMSS\nsurvey (Mauch et al. 2003) as a 81.7 mJy source at 485\nMHz. Therefore we have removed this object from the final catalogue and classify it tentatively as an X-ray AGN,\npossibly a BL Lac, within a galaxy group, where the X-ray\nemission comes preferentially from the AGN.\nRXCJ0934.4-1721 is a source with a marginal X-ray\nextent, but a hardness ratio consistent with thermal cluster emission within 1\u03c3. There is no striking galaxy overdensity in deeper optical images and no clear central BCG.\nA galaxy close to the center with a redshift of z = 0.2499\nwas identified as a BL Lac candidate by Bauer et al. (2000)\nin the ROSAT-NVSS correlation sample. Therefore, this\nobject is most probably not a cluster and was removed\nfrom our cluster catalogue.\nRXCJ1046.8-2535 looks like a point source in the\nRASS and is confirmed to be a point source in a ROSAT\n\n23\n\nHRI observation. Therefore, a cluster identification is\nruled out for the dominant fraction of the X-ray emission. Nevertheless we find an optical cluster at redshift\nz = 0.2426 with 8 coincident galaxy velocities. The source\nis also listed as a radio source in Condon et al. (1998) and\nBauer et al. (2000). There is an indication in the HRI observation that there is a faint halo underneath the point\nsource with a flux of at most 5% of that of the central\nsource, which could be the emission from the cluster. The\nflux is, however, more than an order of magnitude below\nthe REFLEX limit and therefore the cluster was removed\nfrom the REFLEX sample. This object falls most probably into the category of X-ray AGN in a galaxy group or\ncluster.\nRXCJ1213.3-2617 is coincident within 0.5 arcmin\nwith a BL Lac identified by Fischer et al. (1998). Our\nspetrum of the central galaxy does not show an AGN or\nBLLac signature, however, and a CCD image provides\nsome indication of a cluster. The X-ray emission is not\nsignificantly extended and the spectral hardness ratio is\nconsistent with thermal cluster emission. A short ROSAT\nHRI exposure (2.7 ksec) shows only a point source, whose\nflux corresponds only to about 0.13 PSPC counts s\u22121\ncompared to 0.244 observed in the survey. There is no\nsignature of further extended emission in the HRI image. Therefore the most likely interpretation of this X-ray\nsource is an AGN which has shown a dimming by a factor\nof 1.8 between the two ROSAT observations.\nRXCJ1545.7-2339 appears as point-like in RASS,\nbut has a reasonable hardness ratio for cluster emission.\nThe archival HRI data show that more than 90% of the\nflux comes from a point source. Since the total flux of the\nsource is only about twice above the REFLEX flux limit\nand since the cluster emission for this object at a redshift\nof 0.1205 should well be extended at the HRI resolution,\nwe remove this source from the REFLEX sample. Bauer\net al. (2000) list this as a radio source without further\nclassification, making an AGN counterpart likely, but our\nESO spectroscopic observations provided no evidence for\nan AGN. Two coincident galaxy redshifts found make it\nlikely that the AGN resides in a group or cluster.\nRXCJ2040.0-7114, tentatively identified with the\ncluster A3701 at redshift z = 0.1607, is an X-ray source\nthat appears point-like in the RASS with a hardness ratio\nconsistent with cluster emission. An archival ROSAT HRI\nobservation shows a surface brightness distribution with\na bright point source and a faint, small halo with an upper limit on the flux contribution of only a few percent.\nThis brings this X-ray source well below the REFLEX flux\nlimit and we removed this source from the REFLEX catalogue. An R-band CCD image shows a nice galaxy cluster\nwith two bright central galaxies, which is no surprise as it\nwas already classified as a cluster by Abell et al. (1989).\nOur spectroscopic follow-up provides 12 coincident galaxy\nredshifts confirming the cluster detection. Therefore, this\nobject falls most probably into the category of X-ray luminous AGN in a galaxy cluster.\n\n\f24\n\nB\u00f6hringer et al.: The REFLEX Cluster Catalogue\n\nRXCJ2041.8-3733, tentatively identified with the\ncluster S892 at redshift z = 0.0997 (offset \u223c 5 arcmin),\nis an X-ray source that appears point-like in the RASS\nwith a hardness ratio which is too soft by about 1.8\u03c3 compared to the expectation for cluster emission. An archival\nROSAT HRI observation shows only a point source. Our\nspectroscopic flollow-up observations show a Seyfert 1\nspectrum for the central galaxy and provide 8 further coincident galaxy refdshifts. A deep R-band image shows a\ncluster with an appearance consistent with the determined\nredshift around z = 0.1 and the central galaxy appears to\nhave a bright core. At the measured redshift this cluster\nshould appear clearly as an extended X-ray source. in the\nRASS and definitely in the HRI image. Therefore we identify the main X-ray emission with the AGN and removed\nthis object from the REFLEX catalogue.\nThe source is also listed in the bright RASS - NVSS\ncorrelation by Bauer et al. (2000) as an unclassified radio source and as a cluster in the ROSAT Bright Survey\n(Schwope et al. 2000).\n\n8. Notes on double clusters\nOne problem in defining an X-ray cluster catalogue, as\nwell as in comparing different cluster catalogues, is the\nidentification of double clusters and of single clusters with\nsubstructure. This becomes obvious when we compare our\nresults to other compilations in the next section. For the\npresent catalogue we have taken a very pragmatic approach and made the distinction on the basis of a visual inspection as to how well the different parts can be\nseparated. If the X-ray halos are hardly connected in the\nRASS images, given the short exposure, we treated them\na separate units, while different maxima still engulfed by\na common X-ray halo where treated as multiple-maxima\nclusters. This is a subjective criterion because the distinction is exposure and distance dependend. Also due\nto the short exposure in the RASS only a smaller fraction of the objects in this category will be found having\nenough source counts. Therefore a catalogue with any kind\nof completeness is extremely difficult to produce. A more\nviable approach is possibly a statistical characterization of\nthe type used by Schuecker et al. (2001b) to describe the\nsubstructure frequencey in the brighter REFLEX clusters.\nTherefore the present compilation is merely pointing out\nthe most obvious examples of the two kinds, which could\nalso be interesting targets for follow-up studies.\nWe distinguish between two classes of objects in the\ncatalogue: close cluster pairs and clusters with two pronounced X-ray maxima in the surface brightness distribution which were treated as single units. In total we find 10\nclose cluster pairs (including one triplet and one quadruplet) at closely concordant redshifts, listed in Table 11.\nWe have not included pairs seen only in projection where\nthe redshift of the two components is clearly different.\nTable 12 lists those 14 clusters which feature two or several distinct X-ray maxima.\n\nTable 11.

In this case we have assigned the redshift to the\ncluster, which is derived from the largest number galaxies\n(including the bright central galaxy). In most cases the\nassignment is quite obvious, as illustrated by Table 13 for\nthe combined data of our follow-up observations and the\nliterature search. The table is ordered such that the first\ncomponent refers to the chosen cluster identification while\nthe remaining components are ordered by their redshift.\nThe table also gives a helpful reference for those cases were\ndiscrepancies may be found in future observations. Most\nof the detailed information listed in the table comes from\nthe ESO key program of the ENACS survey by Katgert et\nal. (1996) and Mazure et al. (1996). For each line-of-sight\ncomponent we list the redshift and the number of known\ncoincident galaxies.\n\n9. Comparison to other catalogues\nWe have inspected the previously published catalogues of\nclusters detected in the RASS, to further check the completeness of our sample.

Thus these samples are not\nindependent. But since we have used a very strict automated selection criterion for the primary selection of the\ncluster candidates and have not included arbitrarily all we\nknow about clusters in the REFLEX region, this is a very\nimportant completeness test and a test of the galaxy overdensity detection method applied to the COSMOS data\nbase as described in paper I.\nThe XBACS catalogue lists 5 clusters that are not included in REFLEX after four clusters are removed from\nthe correlation (A3186, A3216, A3230, A3389), because\nthey are located in the Magellanic cloud regions that have\nbeen excised in the present sample. For these 5 objects\nwe have a definite reason for the exclusion. A3041: the\nREFLEX flux is 2.58 10\u221212 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 and below the\ncurrent flux limit; A467: is characterized by a point source\nwhich is by about 5\u03c3 too soft to be consistent with cluster emission; A3662: the REFLEX flux is 1.67 10\u221212 erg\ns\u22121 cm\u22122 , below the flux limit of REFLEX, but there is\na \u223c 40% uncertainty in the flux due a low exposure of\nonly 122 sec in RASS II; A3701: (RXCJ2040.0-7114) was\nremoved from our cluster list as explained in section 7;\nA3716: has no exposure in RASS2 (This is implicitly accounted for in the construction of the sky coverage map).\nThus no cluster has been missed in REFLEX which is included in XBACS. There are further some nomenclature\nproblems that are encountered in this comparison: A189\nin XBCAS is a misclassification since the Abell cluster is\nabout half a degree away and the correct identification\nshould be NGC 533 as in REFLEX, A1664 is identical\nwith A3541, A3017 in XBACS is identified with A3016\nin REFLEX. Three clusters are listed with two separate\ncomponents in XBACS which are treated as one source in\nthe present compilation: A901, A1631, and A1750.\n\n25\n\nA comparison with the SGP sample by Cruddace et\nal. (2002, 2003) which is based on the same X-ray source\ncatalogue and source characterization as REFLEX but\nused a different optical search method, shows only two\nadditional clusters with a recently determined flux above\nthe REFLEX flux limit: RXCJ2356.0-0129 which is here\ntreated as a double source where each component falls\nbelow the flux limit, and RXCJ0016.3-3121 which was\nfor the REFLEX catalogue deblended from a soft contaminating component and therefore fell below the flux\nlimit after this treatment. Six clusters listed in the SGP\nsample catalogue with a flux above the REFLEX flux\nlimit have slightly lower fluxes in REFLEX and are scattered below the REFLEX flux limit: RXCJ2306.8-1324,\nRXCJ0048.6-2114, RXCJ0108.5-4021, RXCJ0212.8-4707,\nRXCJ0244.1-2611, RXCJ0248.2-0216. They will be\nincluded in REFLEX II. The following 9 clusters in the\nSGP region are only listed in the REFLEX catalogue:\nRXCJ0034.6-0208, RXCJ0043.4-2037, RXCJ0132.6-0804,\nRXCJ0250.2-2129, RXCJ0301.6+0155, RXCJ2211.70350, RXCJ2248.5-1606, RXCJ2251.7-3206, RXCJ2306.61319. Note that already four of these nine objects have\na problematic identification, as discussed in section 7.\nTherefore the missing of these clusters is to a large part\nnot a real incompleteness but a classification problem.\nThe southern RASS Bright sample, compiled from an\nearlier version of the ESO key program X-ray cluster identification list based on the RASS1 data set (De Grandi et\nal. 1999), contains two additional clusters that should be\nincluded in REFLEX. One was again found in our supplementary search for clusters among the sources found\nto be extended by the GCA analysis, RXCJ2129.6+0005\nat z = 0.2347. This source and RXJ0600.5-4846 were not\nflagged by the optical correlation. Since these objects were\nnot automatically included through the correlation with\nthe COSMOS data we have not included them in the\npresent list. RXCJ0528.9-3927 listed by De Grandi et al.\nis removed from the present list as explained in section\n7. Two further objects from this catalogue have been removed from our sample in earlier steps of the identification\nRXJ2136.4-6224 is a point-like X-ray source coincident\nwith a Seyfert 1 galaxy at z = 0.0588 and RXJ2253.95812 is a point source with a soft spectrum coincident with\nthe radio source PMNJ2253-5812. All the objects listed in\nthe HIFLUGCS sample by Reiprich & B\u00f6hringer (2002)\nin the REFLEX survey area are included in the present\ncatalogue.\n\n10. Discussion and conclusions\nMore than 100 000 X-ray sources were identified in the\nROSAT All-Sky Survey (Voges et al. 1999) and more\nthan 10% of the X-ray sources in the sky away from the\nGalactic plane are expected to be galaxy clusters for the\nrelevant range of flux limits. Thus taking into account the\nsurely lower detection efficiency for extended cluster X-ray\nsources and the Galactic source population one can easily\nexpect about 6000 - 8000 clusters among the X-ray sources\n\n\f26\n\nB\u00f6hringer et al.: The REFLEX Cluster Catalogue\n\nTable 13.

However, the REFLEX sample\nis constructed from a selection with a relatively high flux\nlimit, in order to yield a sample of high quality. The median number of detected source photons for the REFLEX\nclusters is 79 photons. Relatively safe source detections,\ne.g. as listed in the RASS faint source catalogue, can still\nbe obtained from a detection of only 6 photons in a detection aperture with 2 arcmin radius, which for the typical\nexposure of about 400 sec and a typical background in\nthe hard band (channel 52 - 201) of about 3 * 10\u22124 cts s\u22121\narcmin\u22122 would contain about 1.5 background photons.\nThus a detection of 6 photons corresponds roughly to a\n3.7\u03c3 background enhancement and roughly to a flux limit\nof 3 * 10\u221213 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 - a flux limit one order of magnitude below the REFLEX cut. Thus the RASS provides\nthe prospect of finding many more clusters than presented\nhere, but the price is a much lower quality of the X-ray\ncharacteristics as well as a much more difficult job for the\ndefinitive source identification. 1\nWith the relatively high flux cut the high quality of the\nREFLEX sample is characterized by the following most\nimportant properties: (i) a flux determination with a typical accuracy of 10 - 20%, (ii) a large fraction of the cluster\nX-ray sources can be characterized as extended (\u223c 80%)\nwhich adds very much to a safe identification, (iii) we\ncan in general obtain a meaningful spectral hardness ratio\nwhich allows further discrimination in our identification,\n(iv) we arrive at a selection function which is almost homogeneous across the sky. At an even higher flux limit, e.g.\n6 * 10\u221212 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 , only 9 clusters are not flagged as\nextended X-ray sources by our analysis. The spatially very\nhomogeneous selection function ensures for example that,\nfor a detection limit of 10 photons used in most of our spatial distribution analysis, the flux limit is reached in 97%\nof the sky and only small corrections apply for the remaining region. The selection function is also characterized by\nthe analysis of the source photon count distribution shown\nin Fig. 25 of paper I, from which we conclude that only\nabout 14 clusters might be missed if the correction for the\nlower sensitivity in some regions of the REFLEX survey is\nneglected. Therefore the cosmological results derived by us\nin the series of REFLEX papers could also be reproduced\nin good approximation if the angular modulation of the\nselection function given in Tables 8 and 9 were neglected.\nSince the completion of the optical follow-up observations for REFLEX we have already embarked on the\nextension of this survey, REFLEX II which is now close\nto complete down to a flux limit of 1.8 10\u221212 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122\n1\n\nAlready the number of spurious sources is expected to be of\nthe order of 1000 in the REFLEX area for the mentioned low\nflux limit. This is in comparison to a few Thousand clusters to\nbe found in the same area not unreasonable. But good extra\ninformation as for example optical or other wavelength data is\nmandatory for an identification in this case.\n\n27\n\nincluding more than 800 clusters. We stress that in addition to the fact that the X-ray parameters become less\naccurate at these lower fluxes, the identification work becomes significantly harder: the optical counter parts are\nless striking on for example the optical DSS images, it is\nmore difficult to detect and catch the signature of contamination AGN, and the spatial modulation of the selection\nfunction can no longer be neglected. Therefore the gain\nin the statistics by the increase of the sample size has a\nprice and there is some optimum quality and size of the\ncluster sample, depending of course on the application, for\nwhich the flux limit should not be much lower than that\nof REFLEX I.\nFurther work on the identification of RASS clusters\nis useful if the RASS data can be combined with survey\ninformation from other wavelengths. A good example is\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Based on the parent SDSS\ncluster sample from Sheldon et al. (2001) we have demonstrated that we can almost recover the REFLEX X-ray\nluminosity function for clusters down to a flux limit in the\nRASS of 8 * 10\u221213 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 . Work in progress on the\ncombined detection of galaxy clusters in X-rays (RASS)\nand the optical (SDSS) extends these detections to even\nlower fluxes (Schuecker et al., 2003c) recovering an arial\ndensity of about 0.5 clusters deg\u22122 .\nThe high quality of the REFLEX sample makes the\npresent catalogue a useful basis for the careful selection of\ntargets for detailed follow-up studies at all wavelengths. A\ndeep XMM-Newton follow-up study has been targeted at\na complete sample of 13 X-ray luminous REFLEX clusters\n(Lx \u2265 1 * 1045 erg s\u22121 ) in the redshift interval 0.27 to 0.31\n(Zhang et al. 2003) to study for example the evolution of\nthe cluster population at the high mass end, from z \u223c 0.3\nto the present. One first result of this study is that all 13\nclusters of the sample show X-ray emission which is dominated by thermal, diffuse intracluster medium radiation\nand only two clusters have a point source contribution\nof at most 30%. This provides a very nice confirmation\nfor the REFLEX cluster sample, since at this upper end\nof the redshift distribution of the REFLEX clusters it is\nalready quite difficult to recognize the point source contamination of the cluster emission. The same clusters form\nalso the subject of a very detailed optical study with the\nVLT in the frame of a Large Program to study among\nother objectives the galaxy dynamics, the characteristics\nof the galaxy population, and the supernova rate. Recently\na Large XMM-Newton follow-up program has been approved, to study in detail 33 clusters from REFLEX selected in such a way that they form a volume complete\nsample (with a complex but known volume structure),\nthat they cover the X-ray luminosity range almost homogeneously, and that they are optimally observed with\nthe field-of-view of the XMM-Newton instruments. The\nmain goal of this survey is to understand the statistics of\ncluster structure and the scaling relations of observable\nand physical parameters, like the very important X-ray\nluminosity-mass and temperature-mass relations. These\n\n\f28\n\nB\u00f6hringer et al.: The REFLEX Cluster Catalogue\n\nrelations form the backbone of the cosmological application of cluster samples like REFLEX.\nFurther applications of the REFLEX catalogue are in\nprogress involving the study of radio haloes, SunyaevZeldovich observations, correlations with microwave background data (e.g. WMAP), and gravitational lensing studies. The cosmological applications of the REFLEX sample demonstrates the power of using clusters of galaxies\nas cosmological probes in a way complementary to studies\nbased on supernovae and on the microwave background.\nTherefore we hope that in a next step a new X-ray allsky survey which goes much deeper, covers a larger X-ray\nband width, and provides a better angular resolution will\nenable us with much higher precision to test cosmological\nmodels and determine cosmological parameters. There is\na constant effort in the X-ray community to make such a\nproject and such an important progress possible.\nAcknowledgements.
