Here we show that dimple formation on approach and the\npossibility of coalescence on separation of proximal drops in relative motion are\nexamples of this general dynamic behaviour of soft matter that arise from the\ncoupling between hydrodynamic forces and geometric deformations. The key\nparameter is a film capillary number Caf \u2261 (\u03bcVo/\u03c3)(R/Ho)2 that depends on viscosity\n\u03bc, interfacial tension \u03c3, the Laplace radius R, characteristic film thickness Ho and\nvelocity Vo.\nDynamic interactions involving deformable bodies such as drops, bubbles or\nelastic particles that are in close proximity to each other or to interfaces and\nboundaries is a central problem in soft matter physics. Such interactions involve\ntime dependent flows and geometric deformations that occur simultaneously\nacross very different length scales where nm thick films with \u03bcm lateral\ndimensions separate drops or particles ranging from 10's of \u03bcm to mm in size.\nRecent studies of dynamic interactions include the use of: the surface force\napparatus to measure the time-dependent profiles of thinning films between a\n\n\fdeformable mercury drop in aqueous solution against a mica plate1,2 ; optical\ninterference to visualize the dynamic stability of glycerol or water in silicone oil\nsystems3; the atomic force microscope to measure dynamic forces between oil\nemulsion drops moving at typical Brownian speeds in aqueous electrolyte4-6 and\nforces between bubbles and a solid substrate7; and the four-roll mill to manipulate\ninteracting drops8.\nThe above suite of experiments has been modelled numerically using the StokesReynolds lubrication film theory plus the Young-Laplace equation for drop\ndeformations. Key characteristics of thin films such as dimple formation9-11,\nwimple excitation12 and dynamic force measurements4-7 have been predicted with\ngood quantitative agreement. However, a recent drop coalescence study using a\nmicrofluidic cell revealed \"a counter-intuitive phenomenon: coalescence occurs\nduring the separation phase and not during the impact\" and \"there is no model that\ndescribes this phenomenon\"13.\nIn this communication we present a simple and physically perspicuous analysis\nof the Stokes-Reynolds Young-Laplace model that explains the general underlying\nphysics of dynamic coalescence including the above counter-intuitive coalescence\non separation as well as the onset of dimple deformations between approaching\ndrops \u2013 a phenomenon that has been observed in experiments and numerical\nsolutions. The key result can also be applied to deduce geometric deformations of\ninteracting drops from measured forces.\nOur approach is to use a perturbation analysis with matched asymptotic\nexpansion of the Stokes-Reynolds Young-Laplace equations to derive a simple\napproximate solution which captures fully the essential physics and gives\nquantitative accuracy when compared to the full numerical solution of the\ngoverning equations. Consider two identical deformable drops separated by an\naxisymmetric film of the continuous phase. The radial, r and time, t evolution of\nthe film thickness h(r,t) and pressure p(r,t) is, according to the Stokes-Reynolds\nlubrication model,\n\u2202h\n1 \u2202 \uf8eb\uf8ec 3 \u2202p\uf8f6\uf8f7\n=\nrh\n.\n\u2202t\n12\u03bcr \u2202r \uf8ed\n\u2202r \uf8f8\n\n(1)\n\n\fImplicit in Eqn. (1) is the assumption that the tangentially immobile (\"no-slip\")\nhydrodynamic boundary condition holds at the surface of the drops.\n\nThis\n\nboundary condition has been shown to be consistent with a large number of\nexperiments on the micro to nano scale1-7,9,10,12. Deformations of the drops are\ngoverned by the Young-Laplace equation in the inner film region where non-linear\nterms in the curvature may be omitted\n\u03c3 \u2202 \uf8eb\uf8ec \u2202h\uf8f6\uf8f7 2\u03c3\nr\n=\n\u2013 p.\n2r \u2202r \uf8ed \u2202r \uf8f8 R\n\n(2)\n\nThe Laplace pressure (2\u03c3/R) defines the Laplace radius R.\nWe seek a formal solution of the form (see Inset of Fig. 1)\nh(r,t) \u2261 ho(r,t) + h1(r,t) ; p(r,t) \u2261 po(r,t) + p1(r,t)\n\n(3)\n\nand by choosing ho(r,t) \u2261 H(t) + r2 /R as the reference parabolic profile, Eqn.

(4) gives the exact r \u2192 \u221e asymptotic form: h1 (r,t) \u2192 \u2013 (F/\u03c0\u03c3)\n\u221e\n\nlog(r), where F = 2\u03c0 \u222b0 rp dr is the hydrodynamic force between the two drops (F\n> 0, if repulsive). This logarithmic behaviour reflects the fact that Eqn. (2) is an\ninner equation for the film shape. The apparent divergence at large r is to be\nmatched to the outer solution that describes the drop shape outside the interaction\nzone of the film14,15. The appearance of the force F in the pre-factor of the\nlogarithm has been exploited recently to extract the total force exerted on a drop\nfrom the measured outer shape of its deformation16.\nThe outer boundary condition required for the complete solution of Eqns. (1)\nand (2) or equivalently Eqns. (1) and (4), can be derived by imposing a constant\nvolume constraint on the drop4. If one drop rests on a flat substrate where it\nsubtends a contact angle \u03b8 and the substrate is moved relative to the other drop\nwith a specified drive velocity V(t) (V > 0 for separating drops), the outer\nboundary condition takes the form:\n\n\fV(t) =\n\n\uf8eb rm2 \uf8f6\n\u2202h(rm,t)\n1\ndF\n+\n{ log \uf8ec\uf8ed 2 \uf8f7\uf8f8 + 2B(\u03b8) }\n\u2202t\n2\u03c0\u03c3\n4R\ndt\n\n(5)\n\nwhere rm is some large radial position at the edge of the film and B(\u03b8) is a known\nfunction of the contact angle \u03b817.\nTheoretical predictions based on Eqns. (1), (2) and (5)4-7,9,10,12,16 gave excellent\nagreement with different types of experimental studies of drop dynamics but the\ncoupled partial differential equations had to be solved numerically.\nWe now derive a simple approximate analytical solution of Eqns. (1), (2) and (5)\nthat provides informative physical insight into drop dynamics with quantitative\nprecision.\nThe physical rationale in seeking a solution of the form of Eqn. (3) is to express\nthe film thickness h(r,t) formally as a non-deforming parabolic shape ho(r,t) whose\nlocation varies in time via H(t). Deformations are described by h1 (r,t) for which\nwe derive a solution by perturbation. By setting h(r,t) \u2248 ho (r,t) in Eqn. (1) we find\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6 dH\n3\u03bcR\n\uf8f7\npo(r,t) = \u2013 \uf8ec\uf8ed\n.\n2\n2\uf8f8\n2(H + r /R)\ndt\nAnd using this result for p in Eqn. (4) gives h1 (r,t)\n3\u03bcR2 dH\nh1(r,t) =\n{ log(H + r2/R) + C(t) }.\n4\u03c3\u0397 dt\n\n(6a)\n\nBy integrating po(r,t), the force is\n\uf8eb 3\u03c0\u03bcR2 \uf8f6 dH\n\uf8f7\nF = 2\u03c0 \u222b0 r po(r,t) dr = \u2013 \uf8ec\uf8ed\n2H \uf8f8 dt\n\u221e\n\n(6b)\n\nso from Eqns. (6a) and (6b) we see that h1 (r,t) has the expected logarithmic form:\nh1(r,t) \u2192 \u2013 (F/\u03c0\u03c3) log(r), as r \u2192 \u221e.\nThe functions H(t) and C(t) can be determined by applying Eqn. (5) at the outer\nboundary rm. Since ho(r,t) is a non-deforming parabolic shape at position H(t), we\nt\n\nhave \u2202ho(r,t)/\u2202t = dH/dt = V(t) and H(t) = Ho + \u222b0 V(\u03c4) d\u03c4, where Ho is the initial\n\n\fseparation between the drops; and C(t) can now be determined from Eqns. (5) and\n(6a). This then gives the desired solution:\n2\n\uf8eb 3\u03bcR2V(t) \uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7{log\uf8ecH(t) + r /R \uf8f7 +2B(\u03b8)}\nh(r,t) \u2261 ho(r,t) + h1(r,t) = [H(t) + r /R] + \uf8ec\uf8ed\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n4\u03c3H(t) \uf8f8\n4R\n2\n\n(7)\n\nThis is the key result of this communication from which we can infer the\ncharacteristic behaviour of approaching and separating drops. As expected in\nmatched expansion calculations, the result is independent of the precise value of\nmatching position rm, provided in this case, rm2/R >> H.\nWe make two important observations regarding the film deformation h1(r,t)\ngiven by Eqn. (7):\n(i) the magnitude of the film deformation h1(r,t) is characterized by the film\ncapillary number: Caf \u2261 (\u03bcVo/\u03c3)(R/Ho)2 \u2261 Ca (R/Ho)2, where Vo is a\ncharacteristic velocity;\n(ii) the term in braces in Eqn. (7) is negative so time variations of the deformation\nh1 (r,t) and the parabolic profile ho (r,t) have opposite signs whether the drops\nare separating (V(t) > 0 and H(t) increasing) or are approaching (V(t) < 0 and\nH(t) decreasing).\nDimple formation on approach. If the film capillary number Caf is sufficiently\nlarge, the central portion of the film can thicken when the drops approach (V(t) <\n0) and this is the physical origin for dimple formation between approaching drops.\nNumerical studies of drops approaching at constant velocity10 identified a critical\ncentral film thickness hdimple ~ \u03b1 Ca1/2 R at which dimple formation will occur,\nwhere the numerical constant \u03b1 is between 0.4 \u2013 0.7 for Ca between 10\u201310 \u201310\u20134 .\nWhile the perturbation solution Eqn. (7) predicts the same dependence on Ca1/2R,\nthe pre-factor is too large by an order of magnitude. This is not surprising since\ndimple formation actually occurs at separations where non-deforming drops would\nhave overlapped.\nCoalescence on separation. When the drops separate (V(t) > 0), the perturbation\nh1(r,t) will initially contribute a decrease to the central film thickness while H(t)\nincreases. For sufficiently large film capillary number Caf, the initial decrease in\n\n\fcentral film thickness can potentially bring the separation down to the range where\nthe de-stabilizing influence of van der Waals attraction can take hold and initiate\ncoalescence as observed in recent microfluidic cell experiments13 or in four-roll\nmill experiments8 where \"coalescence frequently occurs during the part of the\ncollision after the drops have already rotated to a configuration where they are\nbeing pulled apart by the external flow\". Similar result has also been observed\nexperimentally and verified theoretically for a mercury drop being separated from\na mica surface12. Eqn. (7) therefore provides an approximate criterion as to when\ncoalescence on separation can occur, namely when Caf = (\u03bcVo /\u03c3)(R/Ho )2 ~ 1.\nWe now compare the predictions of Eqn. (7) for the evolution of the film with\nfull numerical solutions of Eqns. (1), (2) and (5) using the following scales4 to\nrender these equations dimensionless and with all terms having the similar\nmagnitude:\nh ~ Ca1/2R,\n\nr ~ Ca1/4R,\n\nt ~ Ca\u20131/2\u03bcR/\u03c3,\n\np ~ \u03c3/R .\n\n(8)\n\nWe use a dimensionless velocity ramp V(t) = vo (1 \u2013 e\u2013t/\u03c4) that accelerates the drops\nsmoothly from rest to unit velocity: vo = 1 (separation) or \u20131 (approach). The\ndimensionless position of the reference parabolic profile is H(t) = Ho + vo (t \u2013 1 +\ne\u2013t/\u03c4). We choose \u03c4 = 1 (in dimensionless units), but since we are interested in\ntimes t >> 1, the precise value of \u03c4 is not important. We choose the capillary\nnumber Ca = 10\u20137 , typical for experiments of dynamic deformations1-3 and\ndynamic forces4-7. For simplicity, we set the contact angle \u03b8 = 90o, so B(\u03b8) = 117 .\nIn\n\nFig.\n\n1,\n\nwe\n\ncompare\n\nthe\n\ntotal\n\ncentral\n\nfilm\n\nthickness\n\nh(0,t) = ho(0,t) + h1(0,t) predicted by Eqn. (7) to the full numerical solution for\ntwo approaching drops (vo= \u20131) from an initial dimensionless film thickness Ho =\n10. Since for approaching drops H(t) is decreasing, the analytic solution is only\nexpected to hold well before the non-deforming parabolic profiles come into\ncontact at H(t) = 0. In spite of this limitation, the perturbation solution of Eqn. (7)\nperforms remarkably well down to a dimensionless thickness ho(0,t) ~ 5 at the\ndimensionless time of 7. Beyond t > 8, the magnitude of the deformation is over\npredicted by the perturbation h1(0,t).\n\n\fFig. 1 Approaching drops (vo = \u20131): Time variations of the central film thickness, h(0,t) of an\naxisymmetric film obtained from numerical solution (\u2022 \u2022) of the film evolution equations (1),\n(2) and (5) compared to that of the reference parabolic shape: ho(0,t) = H(t) = Ho \u2013 (t \u2013 1 + e\u2013\nt/\u03c4\n\n) (\u2013 \u2013) and the analytical solution: ho(0,t) + h1(0,t)) in Eqn. (7) (\u2013\u2013). All quantities are\ndimensionless according to Eqn. (8).\n\nA demonstration of the onset of coalescence on separation is given in Fig. 2\nwhere we show variations of the dimensionless deformation h1 (r,t) for separating\ndrops (vo = 1) from an initial film thickness Ho = 10. We see that the central\ndeformation h1(0,t) becomes negative as the drops begin to separate,\n\nso\n\ndeformations make the film thinner than that predicted by the parabolic profile\nho(r,t). But as the separation progresses, h1(0,t) returns to zero after attaining a\nsharp minimum. If the magnitude of this minimum reduces the local film thickness\nsufficiently, coalescence can be initiated. There is good quantitative agreement\nbetween the analytical results in Eqn. (7) and the full numerical solution. Also the\nspatial form of h1(r,t) at various times marked on the h1 (0,t) curve is reproduced\nrather accurately by Eqn. (7). This is perhaps not too surprising since the\nperturbation calculation is expected to be more accurate as the separation\nprogresses.\nIn Fig. 3, we exhibit the onset of dimple formation on approach by showing\nvariations of the dimensionless deformation h1 (r,t) for approaching drops (vo = \u20131)\nfrom an initial film thickness Ho = 10. In contrast to the case of separating drops,\nthe central deformation h1(0,t) is positive and increases monotonically so that\ndeformations make the film thicker than that predicted by the parabolic profile\nho(r,t) as the drops approach. The prediction of the spatial form of h1 (r,t)\n\n\faccording to Eqn. (7) is satisfactory for times < 6. Note that for drops approaching\nat constant velocity, the reference parabolic profiles of the two drops will\neventually come into contact and the perturbation method must then fail. For the\ncase in Fig. 3, this occurs at dimensionless time \u2248 11.\n\nFig. 2. Separating drops (vo = 1): Time variations of the deformation, h1(0,t) at the centre of\nan axisymmetric film and (inset) a comparison of spatial variations of the deformation h1(r,t)\nat the indicated times (a to d) calculated by the analytical results in Eqn. (7) (\u2013\u2013) and by a\nnumerical solution (- -) of the film evolution equations (1), (2) and (5). All quantities are\ndimensionless according to Eqn. (8).\n\nFig. 3 Approaching drops (vo = \u20131): Time variations of the deformation, h1(0,t) at the centre\nof an axisymmetric film and (inset) a comparison of spatial variations of the deformation\nh1(r,t) at the indicated times (a to d) calculated by the analytical results in Eqn.

If the force F between two drops can be\nobtained, for example, from measurement with the atomic force microscope, the\nfilm profile h(r,t) can be obtained by re-casting Eqns. (6b) and (7), with\nV(t) = dH(t)/dt, as\nh(r,t) = [H(t) + r2/R] \u2013\n\n\uf8ebH(t) + r2/R \uf8f6\nF\n\uf8f7 +2B(\u03b8)}\n{log\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n2\u03c0\u03c3\n4R\n\n(9)\n\nwhere H(t) can be calculated from the way the drops are being driven in the\nexperiment the experiment. To illustrate this idea, we show in Fig. 4 the film\nprofile constructed with Eqn. (9) using the force obtained from our numerical\ncalculation for the case shown in Fig. 3. This example illustrates the connection\nbetween the measured force F and dynamic deformations of the film, and is\ncomplementary to an earlier approach whereby forces between deformed drops\nwere calculated from drop geometry16. The utility of this approach is clear from\nthe improvements in film profiles shown in Fig. 4 over those in Fig. 3 that was\ndeduced from Eqn. (7). If, on the other hand, the drops are driven by a constant\nexternal force, Fext (Fext > 0, to pull the drops apart), the function H(t) can be\nfound from solving: Fext = (3\u03c0\u03bcR2/2H)(dH/dt) which gives: H(t) = Ho\nexp[(2Fext/3\u03c0\u03bcR2)t], a result that has been obtained earlier14.\n\nFig. 4 Approaching drops (vo = \u20131): Time variations of central film thickness, h(0,t) and\n(inset) the film profile, h(r,t) of an axisymmetric film obtained from numerical solution (- -)\nof the film equations given by eqs. (1), (2) and (5) compared to that of the analytical solution\n(\u2013\u2013) of Eqn. (9) using the numerically computed force. System parameters are the same as\nthat in Fig. 3. All quantities are dimensionless according to Eqn. (8).\n\n\fIn this communication, we have derived a simple solution for the space-time\nevolution of the thin film between two drops as they approach or separate and\nelucidated the importance of coupling hydrodynamic interactions and geometric\ndeformations that gave rise to the counter-intuitive phenomenon of coalescence on\nseparation and the familiar dimple formation on approach. Although we have\ngiven results for the interaction between two identical drops, it is straightforward\nto generalize to the case of interacting dissimilar drops or to describe how drops\ninteract with solids17.\nThe above results are valid provided the film thickness is small compared to the\ncharacteristic radius of curvature so that the Stokes-Reynolds lubrication theory\nholds and the tangentially immobile (\"no-slip\") hydrodynamic boundary condition\napplies at the drop surface. As mentioned earlier, this boundary condition is\nconsistent with a large number of experiments on the micro to nano scale1-7,9,10,12.\nFor the case where the drop interface is mobile, internal flow in the drop will have\nto be taken into account by solving an integral equation relating the surface\nvelocity to the surface stress18,19.\n\nIn aqueous systems, inevitable surface\n\nimpurities tend to arrest interfacial mobility and the mobile interface is not\ncommonly encountered for drops or bubbles in the \u03bcm size range20 .\nThe concept of coupling between applied forces and geometric deformations\ngiving rise to novel behaviour developed here can be generalized to soft matter\nbodies that deform because of elasticity or rearrangement of internal structures and\ninteract via forces due to fluid flow, chemical or temperature gradients or due to\napplied magnetic or electrical fields together with differing material properties\nsuch as surface charge, magnetic susceptibility or dielectric permittivity.\nSupported in part by Australian Research Council, AMIRA International and State\nGovernments of Victoria and South Australia.
