Smolyaninov, Y.J.Hung , and C.C. Davis\nDepartment of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of\nMaryland, College Park, MD 20742, USA\nOptical microscopy is an invaluable tool for studies of materials and biological\nentities. With the current progress in nanotechnology and microbiology imaging tools\nwith ever increasing spatial resolution are required. However, the spatial resolution of\nthe conventional microscopy is limited by the diffraction of light waves to a value of\nthe order of 200 nm. Thus, viruses, proteins, DNA molecules and many other samples\nare impossible to visualize using a regular microscope. The new ways to overcome\nthis limitation may be based on the concept of superlens introduced by J. Pendry [1].\nThis concept relies on the use of materials which have negative refractive index in the\nvisible frequency range. Even though superlens imaging has been demonstrated in\nrecent experiments [2], this technique is still limited by the fact that magnification of\nthe planar superlens is equal to 1.\nIn this communication we introduce a new design of the magnifying superlens and\ndemonstrate it in the experiment. Our design has some common features with the\nrecently proposed \"optical hyperlens\" [3], \"metamaterial crystal lens\" [4], and the\nplasmon-assisted microscopy technique [5]. The internal structure of the magnifying\nsuperlens is shown in Fig.1(a). It consists of the concentric rings of polymethyl\nmethacrylate (PMMA) deposited on the gold film surface. Due to periodicity of the\nstructure in the radial direction surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) [5] are excited on\nthe lens surface when the lens is illuminated from the bottom with an external laser.\nThe SPP dispersion law is shown in Fig.1(b). In the frequency range marked by the\nbox PMMA has negative refractive index n2<0 as perceived by plasmons (the group\nvelocity is opposite to the phase velocity). The width of the PMMA rings d2 is chosen\nso that n1d1= - n2d2 , where d1 is the width of the gold/vacuum portions of the\ninterface. While the imaging action of our lens is based on the original superlens idea\nby J. Pendry, its magnification is based on the fact that all the rays in the superlens\ntend to propagate in the radial direction when n1d1= - n2d2 (see the inset in Fig.1(b)).\nThis behavior was observed in the experiment upon illumination of the lens with 495\nnm laser light (the bottom portion of Fig.1(c)) for which n1d1= - n2d2. The narrow\nbeam visible in the image is produced by repeating self-imaging of the focal point by\nthe alternating layers of positive and negative refractive index materials. On the other\nhand, if 515 nm light is used the lens becomes uncompensated and the optical field\ndistribution inside the lens reproduces the field distribution in the normal \"plasmonic\nlens\" described in ref.[6] (see the top portion of Fig.1(c)).\nThe magnifying action of the superlens is demonstrated in Fig.1(d). In this\nexperiment three defects have been produced on the superlens surface, as shown in\nthe optical image obtained under white light illumination from the top. When these\ndefects are illuminated from the bottom with 495 nm laser light they produce plasmon\nbeams, which are emitted in the radial direction. The lateral separation between these\nbeams increases by a factor of two as the beams reach the outer rim of the superlens.\n\n\fTo our knowledge, this is the first experimental demonstration of a magnifying\nsuperlens in the visible frequency range.\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n\nJ.B.
