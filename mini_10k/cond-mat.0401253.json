The relevance of this\nstudy to experiments is also discussed.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nUniformly ordered ferromagnetic states tend to break up into domains due to a variety of reasons.\nThe most familiar reason is the competition between short-range exchange forces, and long-range\ndipolar forces. The domain structure has a lower free energy than the uniformly ordered ferromagnetic state. Imry and Ma [1] argued that quenched random fields in a system may also cause a\nuniform ferromagnetic state to break into domains. The main result of Imry and Ma is that there is\na lower critical dimensionality for a system below which an arbitrarily weak, quenched random field\nwith average value zero would destroy the uniform ferromagnetic order even at zero temperature.\nThey concluded that the lower critical dimensionality is equal to two for spins of discrete symmetry\n( Ising spins ), and four for spins of continuous symmetry (XY or Heisenberg spins). The argument\nof Imry and Ma is intuitively appealing, but nonrigorous. It remained unclear for several years if the\nresults obtained from the argument were correct. The controversy was generated by the existence of\nanother argument based on a field theoretic method that predicted the lower critical dimensionality\nof a pure ( i.e. not disordered ) system to be two dimensions lower than the lower critical dimensionality of corresponding random field system. The lower critical dimensionality of pure Ising model is\nequal to one, and that of continuous spin model is equal to two. Thus the dimensional reduction\nargument predicted the lower critical dimensionality of random field Ising model to be three, and\nthat of random field continuous spin model to be four. It took several years to realize the error in\nthe dimensional reduction argument, and to resolve that the results obtained on the basis of the\nImry-Ma argument are correct.\nIn section II, we define a classical spin model of ferromagnetism incorporating random fields, and\nrecapitulate the arguments due to Imry and Ma for the existence of domains in the ground state of\nthe model if the dimensionality of the system is lower than a critical dimension. Quenched random\nfields are actually realized in several experiments. In the following, we illustrate this with a few\nwidely studied examples [2, 3]. We also mention briefly the difficulties involved in the experiments,\nand in the interpretation of experiments. It is due to these difficulties that the controversy between\nthe domain wall theory and the dimensional reduction theory could not be resolved for several years\nbased on experiments alone.\nAlthough the domain argument gives the correct value of the lower critical dimension, it becomes\ninconclusive exactly at the lower critical dimension. It fails to clarify if Ising spins in two dimensions,\nand continuous spins in four dimensions can support true long range ferromagnetic order. In section\nIII, we discuss in detail the random field Ising model in two dimensions focusing on the nature of\ndomain walls and their roughness in this model. We conclude that there is no long range ferromag-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: shukla@nehu.ac.in\n\n\fnetic order in the two dimensional random field model. Our presentation is largely based on the\nwork of Binder [4] supplemented with numerical simulation of the model. One might also wish to\nexamine more closely continuous spin models in four dimensions because domain wall arguments are\ninconclusive here as well. However, we do not go into this analysis, and not much is published on\nthis problem. The reason is perhaps historical. The conflict between the domain wall theory and\nthe dimensional reduction theory occurred in the case of lower critical dimension of random Ising\nsystems, and therefore the bulk of the study has been on the random field Ising model.\nII.\n\nDOMAINS IN QUENCHED RANDOM FIELDS\n\nWe first describe the random field model for classical spins. A classical spin is an n-component unit\nvector; it is called an Ising spin if n=1, XY spin if n=2, and Heisenberg spin if n=3. Higher values of\nn may also considered. The limit n \u2192 \u221e is known as the spherical model. Mutually interacting spins\nof continuous symmetry (n \u2265 2) do not have a gap between the ground state and low lying excited\nstates, while the spins of discrete symmetry (n=1) do have a gap. Therefore the qualitative behavior\nof continuous spin models is different from that of the Ising model. For simplicity, we shall focus on\nthe Ising model. The model is defined on a d-dimensional hypercubic lattice. Each site is labeled by\nan integer i, and carries a classical spin Si that takes the value +1 if the spin is pointing along the\npositive z-axis, and \u22121 if it is pointing along the negative z-axis. Each site also carries a quenched\nrandom magnetic field hi . The set of fields {hi } are independent identically distributed random\nvariables with a continuous probability distribution \u03c6(hi ). There is a ferromagnetic interaction J\nbetween nearest neighbor spins. The Hamiltonian of the system is\nH = \u2212J\n\nX\ni,j\n\nSi Sj \u2212\n\nX\n\nhi Si\n\n(1)\n\ni\n\nIn the absence of the random field, the ground state of the system at zero temperature has all spins\naligned parallel to each other. The ground state is doubly degenerate. The energy of the system\nwhen all spins are pointing up is the same as when they are all pointing down. To be specific, we\nchoose the state with all spins pointing up i.e. Si = 1 for each site i, and focus on a block of linear\ndimension L inside the infinite system. The volume of the block is Ld . The number of lattice sites\nand therefore the number of spins contained in the block is also of the order of Ld . The surface of\nthe block is of the order of Ld\u22121 . If the spins in the entire block were to flip down simultaneously,\nthe bulk energy of the block would not be affected because the spins are still aligned parallel to each\nother. However, the block would now appear as a defect in the background of up spins. The energy\nof this defect will be the surface energy of the block. The surface energy is of the order of JLd\u22121 . In\nthe absence of thermal energy or random fields, there is no possibility that the block will flip down\nspontaneously in the fashion envisaged above. Now consider the effect of random fields. The energy\nof spin Si in the field hi is equal to hi Si or simply hi since Si = 1. Thus the random field energy\nof the block is simply the sum of Ld random fields inside the block. This sum is equally likely to\nbe positive or negative, and is of the order of \u03c3Ld/2 , where \u03c3 is the root mean square deviation of\nthe random fields from their average value zero. The surface energy of the block is always positive.\nIf the random field energy is negative and overwhelms the surface energy, the block will flip down\nspontaneously to lower its energy. Imry and Ma argue that if d/2 > (d \u2212 1), i.e. if d < 2, then for\nany \u03c3, there will be a characteristic length L\u2217 such that the bulk energy gain will dominate over\nthe surface energy loss for L > L\u2217 . In other words, domains will occur spontaneously if d < 2. The\ncharacteristic length L\u2217 is given by the equation,\n\n\f\u2217 d/2\n\n\u03c3[L ]\n\n\u2217 d\u22121\n\n= J[L ]\n\nJ\n, or L =\n\u03c3\n\u2217\n\n\u0014\n\n2\n\u0015 (2\u2212d)\n\n(2)\n\nAs may be expected, the characteristic size of the domain L\u2217 decreases with increasing disorder\n\u03c3. Although we have considered the formation of a single defect in a uniform ferromagnetic state,\nnumerous domains of linear size L\u2217 will be formed in the system if d < 2, and the uniform ferromagnetic state will be completely destroyed. The density of domains is inversely related to their\ncharacteristic area. On the basis of arguments presented above, Imry and Ma concluded that the\nlower critical dimensionality of the random field Ising model is two, i.e. the model would not support\na uniform ferromagnetic state if the dimensionality of the system is lower than two. The argument\nis inconclusive in two dimensions.\nEquation (1) is readily generalized to continuous spins. The Hamiltonian is given by,\nH = \u2212J\n\nX\ni,j\n\nS~i .S~j \u2212\n\nX\n\nh~i .S~i\n\n(3)\n\ni\n\nThe spin S~i , and the field h~i are now n-component vectors. In the absence of the random field,\nthe ground state of the system at zero temperature is infinitely degenerate. We choose one of the\ndegenerate states, and consider the energetics of the formation of a reversed spin block of size L.\nThe random field energy of the block is calculated as before, but the surface energy gets modified.\nIn the case of discrete spins the surface of the block is sharp. It cuts a pair of spins that are oriented\nopposite to each other. Ising spins can only point up or down. They cannot \"tilt\". The energy\nof a pair of Ising spins across the wall is equal to J compared with \u2212J in the absence of the wall.\nContinuous spins can tilt and the system utilizes this flexibility to lower its free energy. The change\nfrom up orientation outside the block to down orientation inside the block is achieved gradually by\nbending away from the z-axis over a distance that is known as the width of the domain wall. The\nadvantage of bending away from the z-axis is that each pair of nearest neighbor spins in a domain\nwall is nearly parallel, and therefore it is an energetically favorable way of creating a defect. Suppose\nthe angle between a pair of nearest neighbor spins in a domain wall is equal to \u03b8. The energy of\nthe pair with reference to the ground state without any defect is therefore equal to \u22122J(1 \u2212 cos \u03b8),\nor J\u03b82 in the limit \u03b8 \u2192 0. If the width of the domain wall is \u03c9 ( i.e. there is a chain of \u03c9 bent\nspins between an up spin and a down spin ), \u03b8 is equal to \u03c0/\u03c9, and the energy cost of a wall of\nthickness \u03c9 is approximately equal to \u03c9 (\u03c0/\u03c9)2, or \u03c0 2 /\u03c9. This shows that the energy cost of a\nwall goes to zero as the thickness of the wall goes to infinity. In a real physical system, there is\noften an axis of easy magnetization. The domains are oriented up or down along the axis of easy\nmagnetization. Bending of spins away from the easy axis costs what is known as the anisotropy\nenergy. The anisotropy energy increases with the width of the wall, and therefore limits the width of\nthe domain wall. In our simple model, we have not considered the anisotropy energy term. However,\nrecognizing that domain walls have to be finite, we may make the plausible assumption that the\ndomain walls are of similar size as the domains. In this case, the domain wall energy (per unit area\nof the wall) is approximately equal to J\u03c0 2 /L. Noting that the area of the wall scales as Ld\u22121 , we\nfind that the domain wall energy scales as JLd\u22122 . This is the energy cost of creating the domain.\nThe gain from random fields scales as \u03c3Ld/2 as before. Comparing the two terms we find the lower\ncritical dimensionality for continuous spins is equal to four. The characteristic length L\u2217c of domains\nin the continuous spin model is given by the equation,\n\n\f\u03c3[L\u2217c ]d/2\nIII.\n\n=\n\nJ[L\u2217c ]d\u22122 ,\n\nor\n\nL\u2217c\n\nJ\n=\n\u03c3\n\u0014\n\n2\n\u0015 (4\u2212d)\n\n(4)\n\nRELEVANCE TO EXPERIMENTS\n\nA random field is not merely a theoretical artifact. Defects and imperfections in magnets have\nthe effect of creating a quenched random field in the system. We illustrate this with a few examples\n[2, 3] that have played an important role in investigating the effects of random fields experimentally.\nThe connection with experiments was first made by a theoretical argument due to Fishman and\nAharony [2] who showed that a weakly diluted anti-ferromagnet in a uniform external field acts\nlike a ferromagnet in a random field. Consider a one dimensional Ising anti-ferromagnet. Each unit\ncell has two spins, say S1 and S2 that are oriented opposite to each other. The order parameter (\nstaggered magnetization per unit cell ) is S1 \u2212S2 , and the total magnetization is S1 +S2 . The system is\nexposed to a uniform external magnetic field h that couples to the total magnetization. In a randomly\ndiluted system, one of the spins in a cell may be missing. Then the external field would couple to\nthe remaining spin instead of the sum. The remaining spin may be written as an even or odd linear\ncombination of the total and staggered magnetization. We may write S1 = [(S1 + S2 ) + (S1 \u2212 S2 )]/2,\nand S2 = [(S1 + S2 ) \u2212 (S1 \u2212 S2 )]/2. This means that in cells where one spin is missing, the external\nfield couples to total magnetization as well as the staggered magnetization. The sign of the coupling\nto the staggered magnetization ( the order parameter ) is positive if S2 is missing, and negative\nif S1 is missing. The sign of the coupling between the order parameter and its conjugate field is\nrandom because either spin can be absent with equal probability. We may conclude from this that\nthe critical behavior of a randomly diluted anti-ferromagnet in one dimension will be similar to that\nof a ferromagnet in a random field. The argument is generalizable to higher dimensions. An antiferromagnet without dilution has two sub-lattices on which the spins are oriented opposite to each\nother. One of the sub-lattice is aligned with the applied field. In the presence of dilution, locally\nthe sub-lattice with most spins tends to align with the applied field in competition with the global\nanti-ferromagnetic order in the absence of dilution. As in the one dimensional case, the applied field\nacts as an effective random field coupling to the order parameter ( staggered magnetization ).\nThe effective random field produced by the applied field is proportional to the applied field. The\nstrength of the random field is therefore easily controlled. One can do scaling studies with varying strengths of disorder in a system by simply tuning the applied field rather than making fresh\nsamples with different degrees of dilution. This simplifying feature has a far reaching significance in\ninvestigating a theoretical model (RFIM) experimentally, and the interaction between theory and\nexperiment has helped the field develop considerably, and clarified many fine points of the model\n[5].\nIf there is an experimental system that fits a theoretical model well, one may think that the\npredictions of the model may be tested easily by experiments. For example, the domain argument\npredicts the lower critical dimensionality of RFIM to be two, and the dimensional reduction argument\npredicts it to be three, so we may determine the correct value by doing an appropriate experiment.\nHowever, the interpretation of experiments is often not straightforward. Concentration gradients in\nthe diluted sample tend to round off a transition and affect the measurements of critical behavior\ndrastically. Further, the majority of experiments are performed on samples prepared in the following\ntwo ways; (i) cooling it in zero magnetic field, and (ii) cooling it in a magnetic field, and turning the\nfield off at the end. Experiments on samples prepared in the two ways give different results. Three\ndimensional field cooled samples show no long range order and were first thought to show that the\n\n\flower critical dimensionality of RFIM is three. But three dimensional samples cooled in zero field\nshowed long range order. So the question of lower critical dimensionality could not be settled by\nexperiments initially. It was only after several years of controversy that the experimental situation\nresolved itself in favor of the domain argument, i.e. no long range order in two dimensions, but long\nrange order in three dimensions. The main point that was clarified by theoretical work is that the\nfield cooled state is not an equilibrium state. It relaxes logarithmically slowly, and one should not\nexpect to see an equilibrium ordered state in a field cooled sample over any reasonable experimental\ntime scale.\nRb2 CoF4 is a good two dimensional Ising anti-ferromagnet [6]. It consists of layers of magnetic ions\nwith a single dominant intralayer exchange interaction, and an interlayer interaction which is smaller\nby several orders of magnitude. It is very anisotropic so that the spins can be well represented as Ising\nspins. The material can be magnetically diluted by introducing a small fraction of manganese ions\nin place of cobalt ions. Crystals of Rb2 Cox Mn1\u2212x F4 are good examples of a two dimensional diluted\nanti-ferromagnet suitable for an experimental realization of the two dimensional random field Ising\nmodel. In three dimensions, the most studied dilute anti-ferromagnet is F ex Zn1\u2212x F2 crystal. In the\npure ferrous fluoride F eF2 crystal [7], the ferrous ions ( F e++ ) are situated approximately on a body\ncentered tetragonal lattice. Each ferrous ion is surrounded by a distorted octahedron of flurine ( F \u2212\n) ions. The predominant interactions are a large single-ion anisotropy, and an anti-ferromagnetic\nexchange between nearest neighbor ferrous ions. The magnetic moments of ferrous ions on the\ncorners of the tetragonal cell are anti-parallel to the magnetic moments of F e++ ions on the body\ncenters. The large crystal field anisotropy persists as the magnetic spins are diluted with Zn. The\ndiluted crystal remains an excellent Ising anti-ferromagnet for all ranges of magnetic concentration\nx. Furthermore crystals with excellent structural quality can be grown for all concentrations x with\nextremely small concentration variation \u03b4x < 10\u22123 . These attributes combine to make F ex Zn1\u2212x F2\nthe popular choice for experiments on diluted anti-ferromagnets, although experiments have been\ndone on several other materials as well [3].\nIV.\n\nROUGHNESS OF INTERFACES\n\nThe discussion in section (2) was based on domains having flat interfaces with other domains.\nFor example, we considered a cube of upturned spins in a uniform ferromagnetic background. The\nfaces of the cube defined the interface in this case. We could have considered a sphere of upturned\nspins in which case the interface would have been a surface of constant curvature. In both cases,\nthe arguments for the stability of domains presented earlier would hold good. The question arises\nif our conclusions would hold even in the presence of rough interfaces with fluctuating curvature.\nIt is conceivable that the freedom of a wandering interface in a random background would make it\nenergetically more favorable for the system to break up into domains. In other words, the roughness\nof the interface could raise the lower critical dimensionality of the system from the value given by\nthe domain argument. In order to address this concern, several workers reformulated the problem in\nterms of the interface. In this approach we focus on a single interface in the system. It is convenient\nto use a continuum model of the interface. We visualize the interface as an elastic membrane. A\nflat interface is described by a vector \u03c1~ in the (d-1)-dimensional hyperplane transverse to the zaxis. Fluctuations in the interface are described by a displacement z(\u03c1) away from the flat surface\n(z = 0). The displacement z(\u03c1) is a scalar that can take positive or negative values. The random\nfield is denoted by a function h(\u03c1, z) with the property,\n< h(\u03c11 , z1 )h(\u03c12 , z2 ) >= \u03b4(\u03c11 \u2212 \u03c12 )\u03b4((z1 \u2212 z2 ),\n\n(5)\n\n\fwhere \u03b4 denotes Dirac's delta function.\nThe Hamiltonian of the interface is written as,\nH=J\n\nZ\n\n~ \u03c1 z)2 ]1/2 \u2212\nd~\u03c1[1 + (\u2207\n\nZ\n\nd~\u03c1\n\nZ\n\ndz \u2032 h(\u03c1, z \u2032 ) sign[z \u2032 \u2212 z(\u03c1)]\n\n(6)\n\nThe first term is the total area of the interface multiplied by the exchange energy J; it gives the\nenergy penalty for creating the interface. The second term is the random field energy gained in\nroughening the interface on the assumption that the spins are up above the interface and down\nbelow it. The Hamiltonian can be simplified by adding to it a constant term equal to\nZ\n\nd~\u03c1\n\nZ\n\ndz \u2032 h(\u03c1, z \u2032 ) sign(z \u2032 )\n\nOne gets,\nH=J\n\nZ\n\n~ \u03c1 z)2 ]1/2 + 2\nd~\u03c1[1 + (\u2207\n\nZ\n\nd~\u03c1\n\nZ\n\nz(\u03c1)\n\n0\n\ndz \u2032 h(\u03c1, z \u2032 )\n\n(7)\n\nOn length scales larger than the bulk correlation length, the slope of the interface |\u2207\u03c1 | should be\nsmall in comparison with unity if the domain argument is to be valid. In the following, we shall\nassume that |\u2207\u03c1 | is small, and explore the condition for the validity of this assumption. We therefore\nlinearize the fluctuations in the interface to first order in |\u2207\u03c1 |. We also omit an infinite constant\nthat does not depend on the fluctuations in the interface. Thus we write\nH=\n\nZ\n\n1 ~ 2\nd~\u03c1 J|\u2207\n\u03c1 z| + V (\u03c1, z(\u03c1))\n2\nZ\n\u0014\n\nwhere, V (\u03c1, z(\u03c1)) = 2\n\nz(\u03c1)\n\n0\n\n\u0015\n\ndz \u2032 h(\u03c1, z \u2032 )\n\n(8)\n\nOften the potential energy term V (\u03c1, z(\u03c1)) is regarded as an independent random variable with\nmean value zero and variance given by,\n< V (\u03c11 , z1 )V (\u03c12 , z2 ) >= \u03b4(\u03c11 \u2212 \u03c12 )R(z1 \u2212 z2 ),\n\n(9)\n\nHere R(z1 \u2212 z2 ) is a sort range function of its argument [8, 9].\nWe characterize the roughness of the interface over a length |\u03c11 \u2212 \u03c12 | in the mean interface plane\nby a quantity \u03c9(|\u03c11 \u2212 \u03c12 |) that is defined as follows:\nD\n\n\u03c9 2 (|\u03c11 \u2212 \u03c12 |) = [z(\u03c11 ) \u2212 z(\u03c12 )]2\n\nE\n\n(10)\n\nOver large length scales, the roughness \u03c9(|\u03c11 \u2212 \u03c12 |) is characterized by an exponent \u03b6 defined as\nfollows:\n\u03c9(|\u03c11 \u2212 \u03c12 |) = |\u03c11 \u2212 \u03c12 |\u03b6\n\n(11)\n\nIf the exponent \u03b6 is nonzero, but less than unity, the interface is called a self-affine interface.\nWe shall not go into the detailed analysis of the interface Hamiltonian, but be content to give rough\nscaling arguments to show that the interface approach to the problem of lower critical dimensionality\n\n\f~ \u03c1 z(\u03c1)| by \u03c9(L)/L, i.e. the ratio\nyields the same result as the domain approach. We approximate |\u2207\nof the height of the interface to its linear extension. In this rather crude approximation the energy\nof the interface scales as\n\u0014 \u00152\n\u221a\nd\u22121 \u03c9\n\u2206E = JL\n\u2212 \u03c3 \u03c9Ld\u22121\nL\nThe first term gives the energy cost of creating a fluctuation in a flat interface and the second\nterm the energy gain from the fluctuation (the sum of random fields under the interface). The two\nterms should balance each other in equilibrium. Differentiating \u2206E with respect to the height of\nthe interface \u03c9, we get the scaling relations\n\u03c3\n\u03c9(L) =\n4J\n\u0014\n\n\u00152/3\n\nL\n\n5\u2212d\n3\n\n~ \u03c1 z(\u03c1)| = \u03c9 \u223c L 2\u2212d\n3\n, and |\u2207\nL\n\nThe above relations predict that the interface roughness is negligible if d > 2. The domain theory\npresented in section (2) assumes that the interfaces are are not rough. We have now shown that this\nassumption is justified if the dimensionality of the system is greater than two. Actually, the interface\napproach is not fundamentally different from the domain approach. Therefore the interface analysis\npresented above should be seen as a consistency check with the domain approach, rather than an\nindependent proof of the results of the domain theory. The central result of both approaches is that\nthe lower critical dimensionality of the random field Ising model is equal to two.\nV.\n\nABSENCE OF ORDER IN 2D RFIM\n\nConsider an L\u00d7L square of down spins in a plane of up spins. Our task is to investigate if this\ndefect or a similar defect can appear spontaneously in the two dimensional random field Ising model?\nThe energy of the defect (referred to the uniform state with all spins up) is equal to\n\u2206E = 8JL \u2212 2\u03c3L\nThe first term is the energy required to create a domain wall along the edges of the square. Each\nof the four edges of length L requires an energy 2 J L. The second term gives the possible gain\nin energy ( with probability half ) from the random fields inside the square. There are L2 sites\ninside the square. The sum of random fields inside the square is therefore approximately equal to\n\u00b1 \u03c3L. The sum is equally likely to be positive or negative. Only if the sum is negative, the block\ngains energy by flipping down. However, if \u03c3 < 4J, the gain from random fields is not sufficient to\ncompensate the loss from domain walls. Therefore at first thought it appears that the long range\nferromagnetic order will remain stable in the presence of small disorder ( \u03c3 < 4J ).\nWe show in the following that sufficient energy may be gained from random fields to compensate\nthe loss due to domain walls if roughening of the domain walls is taken into account. Suppose the\nsquare of down spins is placed in the first quadrant of the xy plane such that the bottom left corner\nof the square coincides with the origin of the coordinate system. For simplicity, we focus on the\nroughening of just one edge of the square, say the bottom edge along the x-axis from x=0 to x=L.\nSpins above the edge are down, and those below it are up.\nFollowing Binder [4], we cut the wall into smaller pieces along its length and allow each piece to\nmove up or down without bending. The cuts along the length are made in an iterative, self-similar\nmanner on smaller and smaller length scales. First the entire wall is allowed to move up or down\ntill it gains maximum energy from the random fields. Then, the wall in its new position is cut into\nn segments of equal length. Each segment is allowed to move up or down in order to lower the\n\n\fenergy of the system. The process is repeated by cutting each segment into n equal pieces again,\nand relaxing each piece without allowing it to bend.\nSuppose the entire length L of the horizontal wall moves vertically by a distance \u03c9 when relaxed.\nThe area covered\nby the moving wall is equal to \u03c9L, and therefore the gain from random fields is\n\u221a\nequal to \u2212\u03c3 \u03c9L. The wall may move up or down with equal probability. We consider the case\nwhen the wall moves down. In this case the patch of down spins increases in area from an L\u00d7L\nsquare to a rectangle L\u00d7(L+\u03c9) rectangle, and an extra vertical wall of length \u03c9 has to be created\non each side of the moving wall. This costs an energy equal to 2 J \u03c9 on each side. The total energy\nchange in relaxing the wall is equal to,\n\u221a\n\u2206E = 4J\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c3 \u03c9L\n\n(12)\n\nMinimizing the above expression with respect to \u03c9 gives\n\n\u03c9=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c3\n8J\n\n\u00132\n\nL\n\n(13)\n\nSubstituting from equation (13) into equation (12) gives,\n\u03c3\n\u2206E = \u22124J\n8J\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n\nL\n\n(14)\n\nNext we divide the wall into n equal segments. Each segment of length L/n is relaxed independently. It moves a distance \u03c91 , and gains an energy for the system equal to \u2206E1 given by,\n\u03c91 =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c3\n8J\n\n\u00132\n\nL\n\u03c3\n; \u2206E1 = \u22124J\nn\n8J\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n\nL\nn\n\n(15)\n\nDividing each segment of length L/n into further n equal segments, and relaxing each smaller\nsegment independently yields,\n\n\u03c92 =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c3\n8J\n\n\u00132\n\nL\n\u03c3\n; \u2206E2 = \u22124J\n2\nn\n8J\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n\nL\nn2\n\n(16)\n\nThe process is continued till the typical distance moved by the smallest segment is of the order of\nunity. Note that distances less than unity ( in units of lattice constant ) do not have any physical\nsignificance on a lattice. Suppose it takes kmax iterations to reach the end, i.e.\n\n\u03c9kmax\n\n\u03c3\n=\n8J\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n\nL\nnkmax\n\n= 1,\n\n(17)\n\nor,\n\uf8ee\n\nkmax = \uf8f0\n\n2 log\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03c3\n8J\n\n\u0011\n\n+ log L\n\nlog n\n\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\n\nThe energy gained in the entire process of relaxation is given by,\n\n(18)\n\n\f\u2206E =\n\nk=kmax\nX\nk=0\n\n\u03c3\nn \u2206Ek = \u22124J\n8J\n\u0012\n\nk\n\n\u00132\n\nL \u00d7 (kmax + 1)\n\n(19)\n\n\uf8f9\n\n(20)\n\nOr,\n\u03c3\n\u2206E = \u22124J\n8J\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n\n\uf8ee\n\nL\u00d7\uf8f0\n\n2 log\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03c3\n8J\n\n\u0011\n\n+ log L + log n\n\n\uf8fb\n\nlog n\n\nIn the limit \u03c3 \u2192 0, and L \u2192 \u221e, the dominant term becomes\n\u03c3\n\u2206E = \u22124J\n8J\n\u0012\n\n\u00132 \"\n\nL \u00d7 log L\nlog n\n\n#\n\n(21)\n\nThus the energy gained from random fields by roughening the domain scales as L log L. Roughening\nof the flat domain wall also increases its length. However, the increase in the length of the domain\nwall due to roughening is marginal in cases where the domain wall is well defined. In order to see\nthis, we estimate the new length of the staggered contour describing the interface:\n\nLnew = L +\n\nk=kmax\nX\nk=0\n\n\uf8ee\n\n= L \uf8f01 +\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c3\nn |\u03c9k | = L[1 +\n8J\n\n\u03c3\n8J\n\n\u0012\n\nk\n\n\u0010\n\uf8f1\n\u00132 \uf8f2 2 log\n\n.\n\n\u03c3\n8J\n\n\uf8f3\n\n\u0011\n\n\u00132\n\n(kmax + 1)]\n\n(22)\n\n\uf8fc\uf8f9\n\n(23)\n\n+ log L + log n \uf8fd\n\n\uf8fb\n\uf8fe\n\nlog n\n\nThe first term is the leading term in the limit L \u2192 \u221e, \u03c3 \u2192 0.

The important point\nis that the first term ( the cost of making a domain wall ) is linear in L, and the second term (\nthe grain from roughening the wall in random fields ) is of the order of L log L. The characteristic\n\n\flength L\u2217 is the minimum length beyond which \u2206E can become negative, and therefore the system\ncan spontaneously break up into domains. Approximately,\n\u03c3\nL \u2248\nJ\n\u2217\n\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n\nJ\nL \u00d7 log L ; or log L \u2248\n\u03c3\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n\n\u2217\n\n; or L \u2248 exp\n\n\u0012 \u00132\n\nJ\n\u03c3\n\nIt is easily checked that over length scales L\u2217 , the total length of the staggered contour of the\ninterface is of the order L\u2217 because (\u03c3/J)2 log L\u2217 is of the order unity. This proves an assumption\nmade earlier that there is a length scale over which the cost of the domain wall scales as L, and the\ngain from random fields as L log L. The gain from random fields dominates over the cost of making\na domain wall for L > L\u2217 , and the system forms domains spontaneously. Hence we conclude that\nthe two dimensional random field Ising model does not support long range ferromagnetic order in\nthe limit of infinite system size.\nA few remarks are in order:\n1. The energy gained from random fields depends on a parameter n that is an artifact of our\nmethod of estimation of the energy. However this dependence is rather weak because it arises\nvia a log n factor. It is not expected to seriously affect the conclusions drawn above.\n2. Excursion of the wall at the k-th step may take it into a region already crossed by the wall at\nthe previous step. Thus \u2206Ek may have a contribution that is already included in \u2206Ek\u22121 . In\nother words, there may be a problem of double counting in our procedure. Binder [4] argues\nthat this problem is not serious.\n3. Binder [4] also argues that the conclusions drawn above would hold even if all cuts of the flat\ninterface at the k-th stage are not exactly equal to L/nk , but are equal to this value on the\naverage.\nVI.\n\nA TOY PROBLEM\n\nThe analysis presented in the preceding section shows that the energy gained by an interface from\nroughening in a random background scales as L log L, where L is the length of the interface. This\nresult is extracted after several simplifying assumptions and approximations. It is therefore desirable\nto check the theoretical prediction against numerical simulations of the model. The difficulty is\nthat the numerical simulation of the minimum energy configuration of an interface in a random\nbackground is almost as difficult as an exact theoretical solution of the problem. We therefore adopt\nan algorithm that has the virtue of being efficient, and we hope that it captures the essence of the\nphysical problem. Simulation of our toy problem on systems of moderate size appear to bear out\nthe theoretical predictions of the previous section [10].\nWe consider a square lattice of size L\u00d7L, and an interface that joins the bottom left corner of the\nsquare to the top right corner. It is convenient to consider the bottom left corner as the origin of the\ncoordinate system; the bottom edge of the square as the x-axis; and the left edge as the y-axis. The\ninterface is modeled by the path of a directed walk along the nearest neighbor bonds on the lattice.\nThe walk is always directed along the positive y-axis and the positive x-axis. The interface made by\nsuch a walk does not have any overhangs or loops. For simplicity, we assume that the spins above\nthe interface are down, and those below it are up. The spins reside in the middle of plaquettes made\nby joining nearest neighbor bonds around square unit cells. The spins are conveniently labeled by\ncartesian coordinates (i, j) where i denotes the i-th row from below, and j-th column from left. A\nspin in the plaquette (i, j) experiences a random field h(i, j).\n\n\fOur object is to find an interface that divides the up spins from the down spins in such a way\nthat the net interaction energy of the spins with the random fields at their sites is minimum. We\nconsider the spins in one column of the square at a time. Suppose the interface in the first column\nseparates i spins below the interface that are up, from L \u2212 i spins above the interface that are down\n(0 \u2264 i \u2264 L). The magnetic energy of the first column can be written as,\nE(i, 1) =\n\n\u2032 =L\niX\n\n\u2032\n\nh(i , 1)Si\u2032,1 =\n\ni\u2032 =0\n\n\u2032 =i\niX\n\ni\u2032 =0\n\n\u2032\n\nh(i , 1) \u2212\n\n\u2032 =L\niX\n\nh(i\u2032 , 1)\n\n(26)\n\ni\u2032 =i+1\n\nA computer algorithm generates random fields h(i, 1); and computes E(i, 1) for each row in the first\ncolumn (i = 1, 2, . . . L; j = 1). The same process is repeated for the second column, i.e. we generate\nrandom fields h(i, 2), and compute E(i, 2) for each row in the second column. Now a naive approach\nmay be to put the interface at a position in the first column that corresponds to the minimum energy\nin the set {E(i, 1)}, and put the interface in the second column that corresponds to the minimum\nenergy in the set {E(i, 2)} subject to the restriction that the interface in the second column be\nplaced at the same level or above the interface in the first column. Our algorithm described below\nis an improvement over this naive approach. We compute a quantity Emin (i, 2) for each row in the\nsecond column from E(i, 2) and {E(i, 1)} as follows:\nEmin (i, 2) = Min(0 \u2264 j \u2264 i) [E(i, 2) + E(j, 1)]\n\n(27)\n\nThis process is recursed to calculate Emin (i, 3) from E(i, 3) and {Emin (i, 2)}; and so on.\nEmin (i, 3) = Min(0 \u2264 j \u2264 i) [E(i, 3) + Emin (j, 2)]\n\n(28)\n\nAfter L recursions of the process we get,\nEmin (i, L) = Min(0 \u2264 j \u2264 i) [E(i, L) + Emin (j, L \u2212 1)]\n\n(29)\n\nThe quantity Emin (L, L) gives the minimum energy required to place an interface diagonally across\nthe square. Equivalently, Emin (L, L) is the maximum energy that an interface whose length is of the\norder of L can gain by roughening itself in the background of quenched random fields.\nFigure 1 shows the results of numerical simulations on systems of linear size varying from L = 5\nto L = 100. Emin (L, L)/L is plotted along the y-axis against log L on the x-axis. The figure shows\ngraphs for three distinct distributions of the random field: (i) random fields taking two discrete\nvalues \u00b11 with equal probability, (ii) a continuous rectangular distribution of width 2 centered\naround the origin, and (iii) a gaussian distribution of variance unity. The data has been averaged\nover 106 independent realizations of the random field distribution. The figure suggests that the\nenergy gained by the interface from \u221a\nrandom fields scales as L log L. The data for the rectangular\ndistribution has been\n\u221a multiplied by 3. The modified data for the rectangular distribution (after\nmultiplication by 3) lies very close to the data for the discrete \u00b11 distribution. This may be\nexpected because the standard square deviations of the two distributions are in the ratio 1 : 13 .\nVII.\n\nTHERMAL EFFECTS\n\nAt finite temperatures, interfaces are roughened by thermal energy as well as by quenched disorder.\nLet \u03bed be the length scale that describes roughening due to disorder at zero temperature, and \u03beT be\n\n\fthe characteristic length over which the interface would roughen due to temperature if there were no\ndisorder. As discussed in the previous section, \u03bed is the smallest portion of a straight line interface\nthat moves sideways by a unit distance when the interface is relaxed in a random background. We\nget from equation (17),\n\u03bed =\n\n\u0012\n\n8J\n\u03c3\n\n\u00132\n\n(30)\n\nThe thermal length \u03beT is the typical distance one has to move along a straight interface before one\nfinds a kink (i.e. a sideways turn of the interface) due to thermal fluctuation. The density of kinks\nis proportional to the Boltzmann factor exp (\u22122J/kB T ). Therefore,\n2J\n\u03beT = exp\nkB T\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(31)\n\nLet us consider a system with fixed disorder \u03c3, and raise its temperature gradually above zero.\nAt very low temperatures we have \u03beT >> \u03bed and therefore roughening of the interface is dominated\nby disorder. As may be expected, thermal fluctuations are essentially irrelevant at very low temperatures. At higher temperatures, when \u03beT < \u03bed , the thermal effects become relatively important\nand enhance roughening of the interface. Consider roughening by disorder at length scale Lk . The\nstraight segment of length Lk will develop on average Lk /\u03beT kinks due to thermal fluctuations. Thus\nthe mean square deviation < \u03c9 2 >T due to thermal effects will be equal to\nLk\n2J\n< \u03c9 >T =\n= Lk exp \u2212\n\u03beT\nkB T\n\u0012\n\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n(32)\n\nThe probability distribution of the interface width may be written as\n#\n\u221a\n\u03c3 \u03c9Lk\n\u03c92\n+\nPT (\u03c9) \u2248 exp \u2212\n2 < \u03c9 2 >T\nkB T\n\"\n\n(33)\n\nThe first term on the right is the distribution corresponding to a completely random (Gaussian)\nwalk. The second term takes into account the energy that can be gained by excursions in a random\nfield background. Minimizing PT (\u03c9) with respect to \u03c9 gives\n\u03c9l =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c3\nT\n\n\u00132\n\n3\n\n\u0012\n\nLk exp \u2212\n\n4J\nkB T\n\n\u0013\n\n(34)\n\nThe energy gained from random fields at length scale Lk is given by\n\u03c3\nUk = \u2212\u03c3 \u03c9Lk = \u2212\u03c3\nT\n\u0012\n\nq\n\n\u00131\n\n3\n\n2J\nLk exp \u2212\n3kB T\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(35)\n\nSumming over contributions from all independent length scales, we get the total gain in energy U\nfrom roughening of a domain wall in a random medium at a finite temperature\n\u03c3\nU = \u2212\u03c3 \u03c9Lk = \u2212\u03c3\nT\nq\n\n\u0012\n\n\u00131\n\n3\n\n2J\nL log L exp \u2212\n3kB T\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(36)\n\n\fThe leading term in the cost of making a domain wall still scales linearly with the length of the\nwall. At a characteristic length L\u2217 the energy cost and energy gain terms balance each other. We\nget\n\uf8ee\n\nJ\nL\u2217 = exp \uf8f0\n\u03c3\n\n\u0012 \u0013\u0012\n\nT\n\u03c3\n\n\u0013 31\n\n\uf8f9\n\u0013\n\n2J \uf8fb\nexp\n3kB T\n\u0012\n\n(37)\n\nAs noted earlier in this section, the above equation applies in the regime exp(J/kB T ) < (8J/\u03c3).\nRandom field systems with linear size greater than L\u2217 will spontaneously breakup into domains at\ntemperature T. Our discussion assumes that we have an interface with no overhangs and bubbles.\nThis assumption is justified if the density of kinks is negligible, or equivalently if \u03beT >> 1. If\noverhangs and bubbles are present in the system, it is not possible to formulate the problem in\nterms of a single-valued variable z(\u03c1) describing the transverse fluctuations of a wall from a (d-1)dimensional flat reference plane.\nAt higher temperatures, at around the critical temperature of the pure (i.e. without disorder)\nsystem overhangs and bubbles are no longer negligible. At these temperatures, a new length \u03bec\ncomes into play that describes the diverging correlation length of the pure system at its critical\npoint. We have,\n\u03be(t) = t\u2212\u03bd , t =\n\nTc \u2212 T\n,\nTc\n\n(38)\n\nwhere Tc is the critical temperature of the pure system, t is the reduced temperature, and \u03bd is a\ncritical exponent. In a domain of linear size \u03bec , the net random field is of the order of \u03c3\u03be d/2 , but\nthe spins within the domain are not aligned parallel to each other to the same degree as at low\ntemperatures. The average magnetization per spin is of the order of t\u03b2 , where \u03b2 is another critical\nexponent. Thus the gain from random field energy is reduced to a quantity of the order of\nU = \u03c3\u03be d/2 t\u03b2 = \u03c3\u03be\n\nd\u03bd\u22122\u03b2\n2\u03bd\n\n\u03b3\n\n= \u03c3\u03be 2\u03bd\n\n(39)\n\nHere \u03b3 is the critical exponent describing the diverging susceptibility at the critical temperature.\nWe have made use of the well known relations, \u03b1 + 2\u03b2 + \u03b3 = 2, and d\u03bd = 2 \u2212\u03b1, where \u03b1 is the critical\nexponent describing the singular part of the specific heat. Just as the thermal fluctuations reduce\nthe gain from random fields by a factor t\u03b2 , they also reduce rather drastically the cost of making\na domain wall. The domain walls become ill-defined and spread out over a distance comparable to\nthe linear size of the domain, and therefore the cost of making a wall is reduced from J\u03be to J only.\nThe cost and gain become comparable to each other at a value of \u03be given by\n\n\u03be=\n\n\u0012 \u0013 2\u03bd\n\u03b3\n\nJ\n\u03c3\n\n(40)\n\nThe crossover to the length scale \u03be takes place at a temperature given by the reduced temperature\n\nt=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c3\nJ\n\n\u00132\n\n\u03b3\n\n(41)\n\nIn summary, as the temperature of the system is increased keeping the amount of random disorder\n\u03c3 fixed, we may see crossover phenomena between different length scales; a crossover from \u03bed to\n\n\fL\u2217 , another from L\u2217 to \u03be, and finally from \u03be to a distance of the order of unity at very high\ntemperatures. It is plausible that the length scales are rather asymmetrical on the two sides of the\ntransition temperature Tc of the pure system, and they remain finite and smaller than L\u2217 in the\nvicinity of Tc due to slow relaxation of the system on experimental time scales. This speculation may\npossibly explain several observed phenomena in systems where the underlying lattice goes through\na transition driven by a competition between temperature and quenched disorder.\nI thank D Dhar for critically reading the manuscript.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n\nY Imry and S K Ma, Phys Rev Lett 35, 1399 (1975).\nS Fishman and A Aharony, J Phys C 12, L729 (1979).\nD P Belanger, in Spin Glasses and Random Fields, ed.
