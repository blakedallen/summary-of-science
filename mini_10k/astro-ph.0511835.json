The interest of these systems is stressed in view of future\nspectroscopic observations.\nKeywords: LMC, Stars: fundamental parameters\n\n1. Introduction\nAs recalled by Wyithe & Wilson (2001), \"systems where the stars are\ncompletely eclipsed are particularly important because they can provide robust measurements of the ratio of radii\", k. Accurate determination of k is indeed a well known problem in partially eclipsed\nsystems. An impressive demonstration of this is provided by Fig. 3 of\nGonz\u00e1les et al. (2005). Here, I draw attention to a few tens of totally\neclipsing systems in the LMC, which would deserve spectroscopic observations for an orbit determination, and possibly additional photometric\nones for a more accurate determination of radii and surface brightness\nratio. Such systems will be useful, not only for distance determination,\nbut also for comparison with stellar structure models.\n\n2. Sample, lightcurve solution and stellar parameters\nFrom the sample of Wyrzykowski et al. (2003) based on OGLE photometry, we have selected a subsample of 510 binaries with Imax \u2264 18.0,\na depth of the secondary minimum \u2265 0.20 mag and an EA type.\nThis is the same sample as that used by North & Zahn (2004). All\nlightcurves were solved interactively with the EBOP code, assuming a\nlinear limb-darkening coefficient up = us = 0.18 except in the few cases\nof clearly cool components. Out of this sample, we selected visually 35\nsystems with clearly total eclipses. The fundamental stellar parameters\nwere determined through interpolation in the evolutionary tracks of\nSchaerer et al. (1993) computed for a metal-content Z = 0.008 typical\n\nnorth.tex; 23/10/2016; 7:15; p.1\n\n\f2\n\nPierre North\n\nof the LMC. This was done as in North & Zahn (2004), but without\nthe hypothesis of identical components and assuming (m \u2212 M )0 = 18.5.\nThe relative radii, orbital period and surface brightness ratio Js were\nused to constrain the solution. Js was calibrated in terms of Teff ratio through the models of Kurucz (1979). In addition, E(B \u2212 V ) and\nAV = 3.1 E(B \u2212 V ) were determined simultaneously, using the measured B \u2212 V index, following North (2004). The condition that both\ncomponents lie on the same isochrone was not implemented, because\nof the presence of some post-mass exchange systems; for the latter, the\nmasses given are just those of single stars with same Teff and luminosity,\nand therefore may be wrong. For main sequence systems lacking a B\u2212V\nindex, stellar parameters were determined in a cruder way, assuming\nboth components lie on a log t = 7.0 isochrone. The Teff of cool giants in\na few systems were derived from the B \u2212 V or the V \u2212 I index assuming\nE(B \u2212 V ) = 0.143, while the masses were assumed identical to those\nof stars with same MV on the isochrone. Some parameters of the I\nDIA lightcurve as well as Teff and mass of the primary components are\ngiven in Table 1, a more complete version of which is available at the\nsite http://obswww.unige.ch/~north/DEB/tot_param.\nThe errors are the formal ones given by the EBOP code and give an\nidea of the quality of the fit, though one has to keep in mind that some\nparameters were kept fixed in the fit, so that the errors displayed are\nrather lower limits to the real uncertainties.\n\n3. Discussion\nMany systems with total eclipses have also relatively shallow minima.\nAlthough this might be due to 3rd light in some cases, this cannot\nexplain all of them. Many such systems are certainly pairs of main\nsequence stars with a relatively small ratio of masses and radii. Among\nthem, those for which Js \u223c 1 are especially interesting: they are composed of two stars close to the turn-off, with an evolved primary and an\nunevolved secondary. The ratio of radii is often near 0.5. Such systems\nallow to probe efficiently the global metallicity and helium content of\neach component \u2013 as far as the stellar structure models can be trusted \u2013\naccording to the method of Ribas et al. (2000). Since the metallicity of\nthe LMC is less than half that of the Sun, this can potentially improve\nthe \u2206Y /\u2206Z relation obtained by Ribas et al. on the basis of Galactic\nsystems. Adding totally eclipsing systems of the SMC will further improve the determination of this relation, even providing an independent\nestimate of the primordial He abundance through extrapolation to zero\nmetallicity.\n\nnorth.tex; 23/10/2016; 7:15; p.2\n\n\fTotally eclipsing binaries in the LMC\n\n3\n\nFigure 1. HR diagram of the totally eclipsing systems in the LMC. Notice the\nthree systems with giant components (a fourth one, in the I vs V-I diagram, is\nan Algol-type system).\n\nHowever, the great interest of these systems has a price as regard to\nspectroscopic observations: the small k implies a small luminosity ratio\n\u2013 especially in the blue (\u03bb domain of choice because of the number of\nspectral lines) if the secondary is cooler than the primary \u2013 so that high\nS/N spectra will be needed. The UVES instrument on the VLT, used\nwith a wide slit, may be appropriate. Another possibility would be the\nuse of FLAMES-GIRAFFE in the IFU \"low\" resolution mode (R \u223c\n10000), which would allow to observe a few systems simultaneously.\n\nReferences\nGonz\u00e1les, J.

Eleven stars in the list are common to\nMichalska & Pigulski (2005): W03 No 114, 362, 1148, 1291, 1520, 1551, 1748, 1880, 1996, 2279 and 2462.\nThe Teff of cool stars were estimated from B \u2212 V with the calibration of Hauck & K\u00fcnzli (1996) or from\nV \u2212 I with the calibration of Kenyon & Hartmann (1995) (their Table A5).\nNo\n\nIquad\n\nPorb\n\n114\n362\n398\n406\n416\n460\n670\n810\n841\n1148\n\n15.125\n15.266\n16.862\n18.037\n16.736\n16.618\n16.604\n16.743\n17.861\n17.224\n\n2.98958\n3.37025\n3.33782\n13.16448\n5.16691\n2.68062\n4.14459\n3.31516\n5.40797\n2.16054\n\n0.258\n0.306\n0.176\n0.315\n0.175\n0.278\n0.178\n0.342\n0.158\n0.262\n\n2\n1\n4\n5\n3\n4\n4\n4\n3\n2\n\n0.537\n0.733\n1.666\n0.427\n0.473\n0.423\n1.632\n0.357\n0.542\n0.653\n\n04\n03\n47\n09\n05\n04\n35\n04\n09\n05\n\n0.0704\n-0.0093\n0.0031\n0.0000\n-0.2392\n0.0005\n0.0058\n0.0061\n-0.0012\n-0.0341\n\n1208\n1212\n1263\n1278\n1291\n1344\n1381\n1450\n1469\n1520\n\n17.602\n18.034\n17.076\n17.567\n16.898\n17.710\n16.860\n15.439\n17.334\n16.082\n\n2.58542\n2.05110\n6.12966\n7.42814\n5.23194\n4.14494\n79.17160\n2.72713\n1.56400\n1.33832\n\n0.258\n0.245\n0.175\n0.168\n0.184\n0.233\n0.126\n0.330\n0.316\n0.354\n\n3\n7\n2\n3\n3\n5\n2\n1\n3\n1\n\n0.476\n0.497\n0.556\n0.413\n0.504\n0.505\n0.526\n0.605\n0.482\n0.694\n\n06\n09\n05\n07\n05\n08\n07\n02\n04\n04\n\n1551\n1566\n1675\n1748\n1880\n1996\n2009\n2073\n2279\n2289\n\n16.393\n17.566\n17.574\n15.544\n17.202\n17.045\n17.570\n17.007\n16.289\n17.789\n\n1.53805\n3.23738\n3.39105\n5.45728\n1.34524\n1.82795\n3.22935\n2.89578\n3.31752\n3.80450\n\n0.349\n0.223\n0.295\n0.248\n0.333\n0.258\n0.204\n0.303\n0.257\n0.196\n\n2\n6\n8\n2\n3\n3\n4\n5\n2\n4\n\n0.778\n0.450\n0.364\n0.535\n0.668\n0.535\n0.447\n0.386\n0.691\n0.568\n\n2380\n2462\n2482\n2533\n2583\n\n17.374\n16.767\n16.272\n17.748\n17.717\n\n2.83324\n4.26120\n8.07316\n3.27882\n2.07166\n\n0.275\n0.189\n0.177\n0.269\n0.266\n\n4\n2\n4\n6\n4\n\n0.447\n0.617\n1.547\n0.640\n0.567\n\nrp\n\ne cos \u03c9\n\nLp (I)\n\nTeff\n\n00\n03\n00\n00\n09\n00\n00\n00\n09\n09\n\n0.842\n0.682\n0.563\n0.965\n0.829\n0.866\n0.561\n0.896\n0.798\n0.741\n\n0.0192\n0.0535\n0.1714\n0.0011\n0.1656\n0.0009\n-0.0016\n0.0001\n0.0006\n0.0000\n\n18\n23\n06\n00\n08\n17\n10\n05\n00\n00\n\n05\n09\n09\n03\n07\n05\n09\n06\n07\n10\n\n0.0000\n-0.0256\n0.0088\n0.0254\n-0.0001\n-0.0037\n-0.1751\n0.0159\n-0.1347\n0.0001\n\n07\n06\n39\n11\n09\n\n0.0939\n0.0993\n0.0000\n-0.0394\n-0.0346\n\nk\n\nMp\n\nTeff\n\n34768\n21999\n23133\n6387\n19066\n19924\n21405\n14032\n12686\n18293\n\n23.2\n9.6\n7.6\n6.1?\n6.6\n7.2\n7.0\n4.9\n3.5\n5.7\n\n26930\n20959\n8256\n4056\n17758\n18539\n8226\n13591\n11453\n16106\n\n11.1\n7.8\n2.7\n1.6?\n4.6\n4.8\n2.9\n3.1\n2.5\n4.1\n\n0.867\n0.858\n0.762\n0.852\n0.816\n0.812\n0.819\n0.765\n0.889\n0.720\n\n16308\n7348\n14506\n11135\n17385\n11088\n5552\n31983?\n19480\n27348?\n\n5.0\n5.9?\n4.6\n3.3\n5.9\n3.2\n8.6?\n14.6?\n6.1\n10.8?\n\n12647\n6440\n14514\n11313\n15840\n10558\n5214\n23557?\n13044\n21970?\n\n2.8\n2.7?\n3.6\n2.4\n4.0\n2.3\n4.7?\n8.2?\n2.8\n7.2?\n\n00\n13\n00\n06\n00\n12\n23\n16\n09\n15\n\n0.716\n0.864\n0.886\n0.800\n0.753\n0.850\n0.869\n0.883\n0.680\n0.769\n\n22260\n15696\n11436\n19860\n18153\n23050\n18001\n14864\n18293\n13681\n\n7.9\n4.7\n3.5\n8.4\n5.4\n8.1\n5.5\n4.8\n6.5\n3.9\n\n17536\n13351\n11451\n18469\n15305\n16899\n13873\n14108\n18112\n13130\n\n5.2\n2.9\n2.4\n5.8\n3.8\n4.2\n3.0\n3.1\n5.5\n3.0\n\n20\n10\n00\n19\n20\n\n0.852\n0.766\n0.616\n0.736\n0.788\n\n14296\n23378?\n8800?\n10035\n14909\n\n4.4\n8.1?\n9.6?\n2.8\n4.2\n\n13320\n17646?\n7050?\n9311\n13389\n\n3.0\n4.9?\n8.0?\n2.2\n3.0\n\np\n\nnorth.tex; 23/10/2016; 7:15; p.4\n\ns\n\nMs\n\n\f"}
