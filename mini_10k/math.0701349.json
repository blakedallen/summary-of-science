In this paper, we proved the quantum layer over a surface\nwhich is ruled outside a compact set, asymptotically flat but not totally\ngeodesic admits ground states.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe spectrum of the Laplacian on manifolds is a classic domain of research within geometric analysis. One of its least developed area is spectral\nanalysis on noncompact, non-complete manifolds. An insteresting paper by\nDuclos, Exner, and Krej\u010di\u0159\u0131\u0301k ([2], 2001) demonstrated the existence of discrete spectrum, or bound states, of the Dirichlet Laplacian acting on L2\nfunctions on a particular type of noncompact, non-complete manifold which\nthey termed the \"quantum layer\". In particular, the existence of bound\nstates means that at least there exists the lowest bound state - the ground\nstate. The main results in their paper were generalized in [5] and [6] by Lin\nand Lu to higher dimensions under more general geometric settings. The\nexistence of discrete spectrum for the Laplacian is a non-trivial phenomenon\non noncompact manifolds, even when the manifold is complete. The results\nin [2], [5], and [6] are rare instances in which the discrete spectrum is clearly\nknown to exist on noncompact, non-complete manifolds.\nWe recall the definition of a quantum layer below, following [5].\nDefinition 1. Let \u03a3 \u0592\u2192 R3 be an isometrically immersed, oriented hyper~ respectively be the unit normal vector field and the\nsurface. Let N and A\nsecond fundamental form on \u03a3, and define the map\n(1)\n\np : \u03a3 \u00d7 (\u2212a, a) \u2212\u2192 R3\n\nby (x, u) 7\u2192 x + uN , where the number a > 0, which is called the thickness,\n~ < Co < 1 on \u03a3.

The relation between A\nabove is simply to ensure that the map (1) is also an immersion. The terminology of \"quantum\" simply eludes to the fact that when suitable geometric\nconditions are imposed on the tubular neighborhood, ground state exists.\nBefore we go any further, let us establish a consensus on the notions and\nterminologies from functional analysis used in this paper. A good source\nof this can, for example, be found in [7]. We will use \u2206 to denote the\nDirichlet Laplacian throughout the paper, which is a self-adjoint exension\nin L2 (\u03a9) of the positive-definite Laplacian \u2206 = \u2212div \u25e6 grad on smooth,\ncompactly supported functions on \u03a9. The Dirichlet Laplacian \u2206 is thus an\nunbounded operator with a dense domain Dom(\u2206) \u2282 W01,2 (\u03a9) \u2282 L2 (\u03a9).\nThe resolvent set \u03c1(\u2206) of the operator is the set of all complex numbers\nsuch that (\u2206 \u2212 \u03bbI)\u22121 exists as a bounded operator on L2 (\u03a9), and the spectrum \u03c3(\u2206) is defined as the set C \\ \u03c1(\u2206). The self-adjointness and positivedefiniteness of \u2206 imply that \u03c3(\u2206) \u2282 [0, \u221e). The spectrum can be decomposed as \u03c3(\u2206) = \u03c3disc (\u2206) \u2294 \u03c3ess (\u2206), where the discrete spectrum \u03c3disc (\u2206)\ncan simply be defined as all the isolated eigenvalues1 in \u03c3(\u2206) with finite\nmultiplicity and the essential spectrum \u03c3ess (\u2206) is simply the complement.\nThe essential spectrum is stable under compact perturbations in the sense\nthat \u03c3ess (\u2206 + T ) = \u03c3ess (\u2206) for any compact operator T . One would like to\nthink that compact perturbations of the metric on a manifold amounts to\nperturbing \u2206 by a compact operator. This is a useful idealization. However,\nit is heuristic.\nIn light of the heuristic notion that the essential spectrum is invariant\nunder compact perturbation of the metric, the following result (for which\nits less general version first appeared in [2]) is not surprising.\nTheorem 1 (see [2] or [5]). Let \u03a9 be a quantum layer over an isometrically\n~ \u2192 0 at infinity, then\nimmersed surface in R3 , if we further assume that kAk\nthe bottom of the essential spectrum of the Dirichlet Laplaician is bounded\nbelow as\n\u0010 \u03c0 \u00112\n.\ninf \u03c3ess (\u2206) \u2265\n2a\nThe variation principle says that\ninf \u03c3(\u2206) =\n\ninf\n\u221e\n\n\u03c6\u2208C0 (\u03a9)\n\nR\n\n2\n\u03a9R |\u2207\u03c6|\n.\n2\n\u03a9\u03c6\n\n1i.e., \u2206\u03c6 = \u03bb\u03c6 for some \u03c6 \u2208 Dom(\u2206) and (\u03bb \u2212 \u03b5, \u03bb + \u03b5) \u2229 \u03c3(\u2206) = \u03bb.\n\n\fQUANTUM LAYERS OVER SURFACES RULED OUTSIDE A COMPACT SET\n\n3\n\nTherefore assuming asymptotic flatness of the surface \u03a3, to prove that the\nquantum layer \u03a9 has ground state it suffices to find a test function so that\n(2)\n\ninf \u03c3(\u2206) < (\u03c0/2a)2 .\n\nThis was achieved first in [2], and more generally in [5](Theorem 1.1) by assuming L1 Gauss curvature and non-positivity of the total Gauss curvature.\nThus there is the following conjecture:\nConjecture 1. Let \u03a3 be a complete, non-compact surface isometrically\nimmersed in R3 and asymptotically flat. Consider the quantum layer built\nover it. If \u03a3 is not the plane and the Gaussian curvature K is integrable\non \u03a3, does the Dirichlet Laplacian on the quantum layer have non-empty\ndiscrete spectrum?\nR\nThe remaining case of the conjecture above, which is the \u03a3 K > 0 case, was\nanswered partially through special examples of surfaces in both [2] and [5].\nIn particular, in [5](Theorem 1.3) the example of quantum layers over a convex surface (graph of a convex function f : R2 \u2212\u2192 R in R3 ) is demonstrated\nto have ground state (assuming asymptotic flatness). A convex surface has\npositive Gauss curvature everywhere.\nR\nWe must emphasize that in the proof of (2) for the \u03a3 K \u2264 0 case, there\nwas no reference to the immersion of \u03a3 in the ambient Euclidean space.\nThus the existence of ground state there is of an intrinsic nature. However,\nfor the convex surface example, a careful analyis of the (integral of) mean\ncurvature was used in an essentialRway. Therefore, we believe that in order\nto answer the conjecture for the \u03a3 K > 0 case, the mean curvature - or\nmore generally - the second fundamental form of \u03a3, must always play a\ncentral role.\nIn this paper we will discuss another rather general example of surfaces\nwhose layers possess bound states, and the mean curvature on such surfaces\nwill be heavily involved in the analysis. We consider embedded surfaces in R3\nthat is ruled outside a compact subset. A ruled surface is such that for each\npoint on the surface there passes an Euclidean straight line, called a ruling,\nlying also on the surface, and such that a local collection of such lines and\nthe orthogonal flow lines through them constitute a local coordinate system\non the surface. Since this description is local in nature (at least we can\nallow the situation where the rulings end somewhere on the surface), we can\ndefine surfaces which are potentially only ruled outside a compact subset\nof the surface. More details about ruled surfaces will be given in the next\nsection.\nOur main reslut is as follows:\nTheorem 2 (Main Theorem). Let \u03a3 be a surface in R3 that is ruled outside\na compact subset. Then the bottom of the spectrum of the Dirichlet Laplacian\n\n\f4\n\nCHRISTOPHER LIN AND ZHIQIN LU\n\non a quantum layer \u03a9 of thickness a over \u03a3 has the upperbound\n\u03c0 \u00012\n.\ninf \u03c3(\u2206) <\n2a\nRemark 1. Note that for a surface which is ruled outside a compact set,\nthe Gauss curvature is automatically integrable. The surface also can't be\nflat outside a compact set, because otherwise the total Gauss curvature would\nbe zero and in that case, the theorem follows from the main theorem in [1],\nor [5].\nUsing Theorem 1, we also obtain the following:\nCorollary 1. The layer above, along with the assumption that the second\nfundamental form goes to zero at infinity, has Dirichlet ground state.\nWe end this section with an overview of the rest of the paper. In section 2 we discuss the (local) geometry of ruled surfacs. In section 3 we\ngive relevant information about the topology of noncompact surfaces with\nintegrable Gauss curvature. The dicussion there will center around the generalized Gauss-Bonnet Theorem of Hartman [3]. In particular, we will make\nessential use of the theorem of B. White [8] in the proof of the main theorem.\nSection 4 contains the proof of the main theorem.\nAcknowledgement.

The Geometry of Ruled Surfaces\nHere we discuss some basic geometry about ruled surfaces.\nDefinition 2. A non-intersecting surface \u03a3 in R3 is called a ruled surface\nif every point lies in a coordinate chart of the form\n(3)\n\nx(s, v) = \u03b2(s) + v\u03b4(s),\n\nwhere \u03b2 and \u03b4 are vectors in R3 .\nIt is important to note that the coordinate charts described above are in\ngeneral only local. We can always choose \u03b2 to be unit speed and \u03b4 to be a\nunit vector field. Furthermore, we may reparameterize the coordinate chart\nabove so that\n\uf8f1\n\u2032\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2|\u03b2 | = 1;\n(4)\n|\u03b4| = 1;\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u2032\nh\u03b2 , \u03b4i = 0.\n\n\fQUANTUM LAYERS OVER SURFACES RULED OUTSIDE A COMPACT SET\n\n5\n\n\u2032\n\nBy product rule we also have h\u03b4 , \u03b4i = 0. From Definition 2 we see that at\neach point of a ruled surface \u03a3, there exists a straight line segment in R3\nthat also lies in \u03a3. Such a line segment, called a generator, is simply the vparameter curve of the coordinate system provided by (3). Now, we see that\n\u2032\n\u2032\nhxs , xv i = h\u03b2 , \u03b4i + vh\u03b4 , \u03b4i = 0, hence we have local orthogonal coordinate\nsystems on a ruled surface \u03a3. Then letting X = xv and Y = xs /|xs |, we\nget local orthonormal frames on \u03a3. Denote by f (v) and h(t) the integral\ncurves of X and Y , respectively. Let N denote the oriented unit normal on\n\u03a3, then the Gauss curvature on \u03a3 is\nd\nd\nd\n(5)\nK = h N \u25e6 f, Xih N \u25e6 h, Y i \u2212 h N \u25e6 f, Y i2 .\ndv\ndt\ndv\n\u2032\u2032\nSince the ruling f (v) is really a line segment, f = 0, so by product rule we\nsee that\nd\n\u2032\u2032\nh N \u25e6 f, Xi = \u2212hN, f i = 0.\ndv\nThus K \u2264 0 on a ruled surface by (5). A surface \u03a3 is called a developable surface\nif it is a ruled surface such that its normal is parallel in R3 along any of its\nd\nN \u25e6 f = 0. Then again by (5) we see that K \u2261 0 on a degenerators, i.e. dv\nvelopable surface. In fact the concept of a developable surface is inseparable\nfrom the zero Gauss curvature condition:\nTheorem 3 (Massey's Theorem). (Corollary to Theorem 5, [4]) A complete, connected surfcace in R3 is a developable surface if and only if K \u2261 0.2\nNext we compute the mean curvature on a ruled surface \u03a3. Let \u00d7 denote\nthe cross pruduct of vectors in R3 . Moreover, since |xv | = |\u03b4| = 1 we have\n|xs \u00d7 xv | = |xs |. The mean curvature on \u03a3 is computed as\nd\nd\nH = h\u2212 N \u25e6 f, Xi + h\u2212 N \u25e6 h, Y i\ndv\ndt\nhxs \u00d7 xv , xss i\n(6)\n.\n=\n|xs \u00d7 xv |3\n3. The Topology of Noncompact Surfaces\nThe famous Gauss-Bonnet Theorem asserts that the total Gauss curvature of a compact 2-dimensional manifold without boundary is a constant\nmultiple of its Euler Characteristic. If a surface is complete, non-compact,\nbut has integrable Gauss curvature, then the total Gauss curvature is no\nlonger completely topological. In 1957, A. Huber showed that a complete,\nnoncompact surface \u03a3 of integrable curvature is conformally equivalent to\n2It is an elementary exercise to show that a ruled surface is developable if and only if\nit has zero Gauss curvature. The more general theorem of Massey, on the other hand, is\nquite non-trivial.\n\n\f6\n\nCHRISTOPHER LIN AND ZHIQIN LU\n\na compact Riemann surface with finitely many punctures.

The ends contribute to the deficit in (7) via the following\nwonderful result.\nTheorem 4 (Hartman [3] '64). Let \u03a3 be a complete, noncompact surface\nwith integrable Gauss curvature. Then\nZ\nk\nX\n1\n\u03bbi ,\nK = \u03c7(\u03a3) \u2212\n(8)\n2\u03c0 \u03a3\ni=1\n\nwhere \u03c7(\u03a3) is the Euler characteristic of the surface.\n\nP\nThe Euler Characteristic is defined by \u03c7(\u03a3) = (\u22121)i bi , where bi is the\ni-th Betti number. Now, we always assume implicitly that manifolds are\nconnected, hence path-connected. Thus for a noncompact (path-connected)\nsurface, \u03c7(\u03a3) = 1 \u2212 b1 , and in the case that \u03a3 also has integrable Gauss\ncurvature we see that in fact\nZ\nK \u2264 2\u03c0.\n(9)\n\u03a3\nR\nMoreover, if we assume that \u03a3 K > 0, then by (8) we must have b1 = 0\nas well. This means \u03c7(\u03a3) = 1, which via the uniformization theorem for\nsurfaces implies that \u03a3 is conformally equivalent to R2 . Therefore we see\nthat positve total Gauss curvature surfaces are topologically very simple\n(it is just R2 ). However, ironically the analysis which are hopeful towards\ndeducing the existence of ground state is significantly less straight-forward.\nContrasting this with the non-positive total Gaussian curvature case, where\nvia Hartman's formula, if we start with any surface and add sufficient many\nhandles we could obtain a ground state eventually.3\nFor later use, we shall need the following result of B. White, which depends\non the way in which a surface sits in R3 .\nTheorem 5 (B. White [8] '87). Let \u03a3 be a surface immersed in R3 . If\nR\nR\n~2\n\u03a3 |A| < \u221e, then K is integrable and \u03a3 K = 4\u03c0n for some n \u2208 Z.\n3This was first discussed in a subsequent paper [2] to [1].\n\n\fQUANTUM LAYERS OVER SURFACES RULED OUTSIDE A COMPACT SET\n\n7\n\n4. Proof of Main Result\nWe assume that the surface \u03a3 is ruled outside B(R0 ), where we have\nsuppressed the reference point x0 with respect to which the geodesic distance\nR0 is measured. From now on if the center of a geodesic ball of certain\nradius is suppressed, it is implicit that the center is the point x0 . Thus\neach point in \u03a3 \\ B(R0 ) is contained in a local coordinate chart given by\nx(s, v) = \u03b2(s) + v\u03b4(s) for a curve \u03b2 in R3 and a nonzero outward-pointing\nvector field \u03b4 along \u03b2.\nWe would like to have a finite cover of \u03a3 \\ B(R0 ) with ruled coordinate\ncharts satisfying property (4). Let R1 > R0 . For any point p \u2208 \u2202B(R1 ),\nthere exists a local ruled coordinate chart with property (4). However, we\nmust pay attention to the possibility that in the reparameterization described above, t(s) may be so negative for some s that \u03b3(s) is no longer on\nthe surface \u03a3. Such a possibility requires consideration since our surface is\nnot entirely ruled. Note that however,\nZ s\nZ s\ndu = l(\u03b2).\nh\u03b2 \u2032 , \u03b4i du \u2264\n(10)\n|t(s)| \u2264\n0\n\n0\n\nTherefore for each point p \u2208 \u2202B(R1 ), without loss of generality let x(s, v) :\n(\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5) \u00d7 (b, \u221e) \u2212\u2192 \u03a3 be a ruled coordinate chart satisfying property (4)\nsuch that p = x(0, 0). If we further require that \u03b5 < l(\u03b2), then the image of\nx will definitely lie in \u03a3.4 Then since \u2202B(R1 ) is compact, there is a finite\ncollection of such coordinate charts covering \u03a3 \\ B(R1 ), assuming that we\nalso take R1 large enough.\nBy (6) and using property (4), the mean curvature has the expression\nH=\n\n(11)\n\nhxs \u00d7 xv , xss i\n|xs \u00d7 xv |3\n\n\u0010 \u2032\n\u0011\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nh\u03b2 \u00d7 \u03b4, \u03b2 i + v h\u03b4 \u00d7 \u03b4, \u03b2 i + h\u03b2 \u00d7 \u03b4, \u03b4 i + v 2 h\u03b4 \u00d7 \u03b4, \u03b4 i\n.\n=\n\u00113/2\n\u0010\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032 2\n2\n1 + 2vh\u03b2 , \u03b4 i + v |\u03b4 |\n\nLet us denote the numerator of H above by P , and the term inside the\n3/2 power in the denominator by Q.

Moreover, by (11) if we assume v is large\n4The number b < 0 can always be chosen accordingly so that this is true.\n\n\f8\n\nCHRISTOPHER LIN AND ZHIQIN LU\n\nenough, H 6= 0 along the ruling line for s = 0. Switching the orientation of\n\u03a3 if necessarily, we can then take \u03b5 small enough and v0 large enough\nfor\n\u0001\nall s \u2208 (\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5) such that H > 0 for all v \u2265 v0 on x (\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5) \u00d7 (v0 , \u221e) . This\nassumption on the positive sign of H will be made implicitly throughout the\nremaining arguments.\nLemma 1. Let t > 0 and \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 (\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5) such that \u03b1 < \u03b2. Suppose that\ndeg(P ) and deg(Q) remain unchanged on (\u03b1, \u03b2). Then the integral\nZ \u03b2 Z t+t0\nH|xs \u00d7 xv | dv ds = o(t0 )\n\u03b1\n\nt\n\nfor large enough t if and only if deg(P ) < deg(Q) for all s \u2208 (\u03b1, \u03b2).\n\nProof. First we suppose\ndeg(P ) < deg(Q), which consists of only two\n\u0001\ncases: deg(P ), deg(Q) = (1, 2), and (0, 2). For the first case, since [\u03b1, \u03b2] is\ncompact we can choose constants C1 , C2 > 0 such that for large enough v,\n\nQ > C2 v 2\n\u221a\nfor all s \u2208 (\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5). Then by (11), since |xs \u00d7 xv | = 1 + Av + Bv 2 , we see\nthat\nZ \u03b2 Z t+t0\nZ \u03b2 Z t+t0\n\u0010t + t \u0011\nP\n0\ndv ds < C log\nH|xs \u00d7 xv | dv ds =\n(12)\nQ\nt\n\u03b1\nt\n\u03b1\nt\nP < C1 v\n\nand\n\nfor some constant C > 0, hence o(t0 ). For the second case, similarly we can\nfind constants C1 , C2 > 0 such that for large enough v,\nP < C1\n\nand\n\nQ > C2 v 2\n\nfor all s \u2208 (\u03b1, \u03b2). Then we see that for large enough t,\nZ \u03b2 Z t+t0\n\u00101\n1 \u0011\nH|xs \u00d7 xv | dv ds < C\n(13)\n,\n\u2212\nt\nt + t0\n\u03b1\nt\n\nwhich is clearly o(t0 ).\n\n\u0001\nNext suppose deg(P ) \u2265 deg(Q), which consists of three cases: deg(P ), deg(Q)\n= (2, 2), (0, 0), and (1, 0). In any of these cases, we can long divide (for each\ns) and get\nP\nR\n= P\u0303 + ,\nQ\nQ\n\n(14)\n\nwhere deg(P\u0303 ) = deg(P ) \u2212 deg(Q), and deg(R) < deg(Q). For large enough\nt, the integral over (\u03b1, \u03b2) \u00d7 (t, t + t0 ) of the second term in (14) is o(t0 ) by\napplying the previous argument. However, integrating the first term in (14)\nwe see that it becomes a polynomial in t0 of degree at least 1. To be more\nprecise, for large eough t we have\nZ \u03b2 Z t+t0\nH|xs \u00d7 xv | dv ds = f (t0 ) + o(t0 ),\n\u03b1\n\nt\n\n\fQUANTUM LAYERS OVER SURFACES RULED OUTSIDE A COMPACT SET\n\n9\n\nwhere f (t0 ) is a polynomial of degree either 1 (corresponding to the (2,2)\nand (0,0) cases listed above) or 2 (corresponding to the (1,0) case) with\ncoefficients in t. Hence it cannot be o(t0 ).\n\u0003\nLemma 1 is an important lemma that will allow us to deduce the existence\nof ground states. In particular, we will need the integral of H over a sectorlike region in \u03a3\\B(R0 ) to grow at least linearly in t0 (i.e., in the ruling\ndirection). In view of this, we shall need to prove the following result.\nProposition 1. Let \u03a3 be a surface embedded in R3 that is ruled, but nonflat outsideR B(R0 ) for some R0 > 0. Furthermore, assume the total Gauss\ncurvature \u03a3 K > 0. Then there exists p \u2208 \u03a3 \\ B(R0 ), H(p) 6= 0, and\na ruled coordinate chart x : (\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5) \u00d7 (b, \u221e) \u2212\u2192 \u03a3 satifying (4) such that\np = x(0, 0) and deg(P ) \u2265 deg(Q) at s = 0 \u2208 (\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5).\nBefore we proceed with the proof of Proposition 1, let us remark on its\nnature. Any point p \u2208 \u03a3 \\ B(R0 ) such that H(p) 6= 0 lies in a ruled\ncoordinate chart satifying (4), and we can always reparameterize the chart\nso that x(0, 0) = p by translation in the v-direction. Moreover, the degrees\nof P and Q certainly do not change under translation in v. Therefore, the\nproposition is really a statement about the ruled coordinate charts covering\n\u03a3 \\ B(R0 ).\nProof of Proposition 1. Let p \u2208 \u03a3 \\ B(R0 ) with H(p) 6= 0. Consider\na ruled coordinate chart x : (\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5) \u00d7 (b, \u221e) \u2212\u2192 \u03a3 containing p such that\nx(0, 0) = p. Suppose deg(P ) < deg(Q) for all s \u2208 (\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5) on such a chart,\nwe will prove that\nZ \u03b5Z \u221e\n(15)\nH 2 |xs \u00d7 xv | dv ds < \u221e.\n\u2212\u03b5\n\n0\n\nNow suppose deg(P ) < deg(Q) at s = 0 for all points p = x(0, 0) with\nH(p) 6= 0. By continuity, we may assume \u03b5 is small enough so that H(s, 0) 6=\n0 for all s \u2208 (\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5). For such a chart x, deg(P ) < deg(Q) for all s \u2208 (\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5).\nTo see this, suppose deg(P ) \u2265 deg(Q) at some s0 \u2208 (\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5). Then we can\nmake the reparametrization\n\u03b2(s) \u2212\u2192 \u03b2(s \u2212 s0 )\n\nand\n\n\u03b4(s) \u2212\u2192 \u03b4(s \u2212 s0 )\n\nto obtain a new ruled coordinate chart x\u0303 with x\u0303(0, 0) = x(s0 , 0). Note that\nproperty (4) is preserved for x\u0303, and moreover the coefficients A, B, D, E, J\nare also invariant under the reparametrization above. Thus deg(P\u0303 ) = deg(P )\nand deg(Q\u0303)=deg(Q), and we would get a contradiction. Then via (15) and\nby our earlier remark on the existence of a finite cover of \u03a3 \\ B(R0 ) by\nruled coordinate charts, it would imply that H \u2208 L2 (\u03a3). By the elementary\n~ 2 + 2K and the fact that K \u2208 L1 (\u03a3), we must then\nformula H 2 = |A|\n\n\f10\n\nCHRISTOPHER LIN AND ZHIQIN LU\n\nR\n~2\nhave\n\u03a3 |A| < \u221e, which by B. White's theorem (Theorem 5) means that\nR\n\u03a3 K = 4\u03c0n for some n \u2208 Z. However, the assumption of connectedness and\nnoncompactness of \u03a3 implies we must have Euler characteristic \u03c7(\u03a3) \u2264 1.\nThen by Hartman's formula and our hypothesis we must have\nZ\nK \u2264 2\u03c0,\n(16)\n0 <\n\u03a3\n\nwhich would give a contradiction.\nNow we prove (15) assuming deg(P ) < deg(Q) for all s \u2208 (\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5) on a\nchart. First we see that\nZ t\nZ t\nP2\n2\ndv.\nH |xs \u00d7 xv | dv =\n(17)\n5/2\n0 Q\n0\n\u0001\nFirst consider all s \u2208 (\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5) such that deg(P ), deg(Q) = (1, 2). Since the\ncoefficients of P and Q are functions of s bounded on (\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5), we can choose\nc > 0 such that Q > 1, Q2 > Cv 4 for some constant C > 0, and P 2 < Cv 2\nfor some constant C > 0, for all v > c and for all such s. Then for any such\ns, we have\nZ t 2\nZ t\nP\nP2\ndv\ndv \u2264\n2\n5/2\nQ\nQ\nc\nc\nZ t\n1\n<C\ndv\n2\nc v\n\u00101 1\u0011\n(18)\n,\n\u2212\n=C\nc\nt\n\n\u0001\nwhich converges as t \u2192 \u221e. Similarly, for any s \u2208 (\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5) at which deg(P ), deg(Q)\n= (0, 2) we have\nZ t 2\nZ t\nP\n1\n2\ndv \u2264 P\ndv\n2\n5/2\nc Q\nc Q\nZ t\n1\n2\n<CP\ndv\n4\nv\nc\n\u00101\n1\u0011\n(19)\n= C P2 3 \u2212 3 ,\nc\nt\nwhich again converges as t \u2192 \u221e. Combining (18) and (19) proves (15) and\nhence the proposition.\n\u0003\n\nRemark 2. Although this is not necessary for the proof of Proposition 1,\nit is in good spirit to check that deg(P ) \u2265 deg(Q) at p = x(0, 0) does not\nrender H 2 unintegrable over (\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5) \u00d7 (0, \u221e) for a small enough \u03b5 > 0 where\ndeg(P ) and deg(Q) are unchanged. As in the previous case of deg(P ) <\ndeg(Q), we can narrow down to three cases. The first two consist of deg(P )\n\n\fQUANTUM LAYERS OVER SURFACES RULED OUTSIDE A COMPACT SET\n\n11\n\n= 1, 0 coupled with deg(Q) = 0. It is clear in these two cases that\nZ \u03b5Z t\nH 2 |xs \u00d7 xv | dv ds\n\u2212\u03b5\n\n0\n\ndoes not converge as t \u2192 \u221e.

There exists a point p \u2208 \u03a3 \\ B(R0 ), H(p) 6= 0, and a ruled\ncoordinate chart x : (\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5) \u00d7 (b, \u221e) \u2212\u2192 \u03a3 satisfying (4) such that deg(P )\n\u2265 deg(Q) for all s \u2208 (\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5). Moreover, we can choose the chart so that\ndeg(P ) and deg(Q) are fixed for all s \u2208 (\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5).\nProof. By Proposition 1, there exists at least one point p \u2208 \u03a3 \\ B(R0 ),\nH(p) 6= 0, and a ruled coordinate chart x : (\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5) \u2212\u2192 \u03a3 such that x(0, 0) =\np and deg(P ) \u2265 deg(Q) at s = 0. Suppose at such a point p = x(0, 0),\nthe first assertion of the corollary is false. Then by the smoothness of the\ncoefficients of P and Q in s, there must exist an \u03b5 > 0, \u03b5 \u2264 \u03b5, such that\ndeg(P ) \u2265 deg(Q) at s = 0 and deg(P ) < deg(Q) for all s \u2208 (\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5) \\ {0}.\nThus the ruling lines that pass through these points must comprise a set of\ndiscrete lines, and hence of measure zero. Then applying the integration of\nH 2 argument in Proposition 1, we would get the same contradiction as we\ndid there.\nNext we argue that we can fix deg(P ) and deg(Q) in a small enough interval of s. Observe that due to the smoothness of the coefficient functions in\ns, the degrees of P and Q cannot decrease in an arbitrarily small \u0001neighborhood of s, but it can certainly increase. Now, if deg(P ), deg(Q) = (2, 2)\nat s = 0, then since this is the case of the largest possible degrees, we can\ncertainly find an \u03b5 > 0 small enough so that the degrees remain 2 for all\ns \u2208 (\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5). If we are in the (1, 0) case at s = 0, then either the degrees remain as (1, 0) in a small interval about s = 0, or there exists an s0 near s at\nwhich the degrees increase to (2, 2) and to which we can apply the preceding\nargument upon reparametrization of the chart. For the last case of (0, 0), if\nthe degrees increase near s = 0 then we simply apply the arguments in the\nprevious two cases.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 2.\nNow, the surface\nR is not totally-geodesic (nonplanar) by our hypothesis. Therefore if \u03a3 K \u2264 0, the conclusion of the\ntheorem follows as a special case\nR of the result in [5].

Let \u03a3 be an embedded surface in R3 with zero Gauss curvature\nbut non-flat outside a compact subset.

Our proof depends heavily on the fact that the surface is ruled\noutside a compact set. If we assume that the surface is asymptotically flat,\nthen it is asymptotically ruled on any compact set. However, with only the\nasymptotic flatness, we don't know the behavior of the surface at infinity.\nThus the analysis in this paper is not enough to prove Conjecture 1. More\ncareful estimates are needed but the motivation of the development of the\ntechniques in this paper is clearly justified.\n\n\fQUANTUM LAYERS OVER SURFACES RULED OUTSIDE A COMPACT SET\n\n17\n\nReferences\n[1] G.
