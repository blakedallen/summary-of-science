The current method of flow estimation mainly uses the ground flow equation,\nwhich is a partial differential equation. Software systems such as MODFLOW can only\nsolve 2D equations and pass the data vertically to form a 3D volume. The research on the\n3D models of groundwater flow has fundamental and practical importance to\nhydrogeology. A method used to establish a true 3D Groundwater flow will be very\nuseful to groundwater related research in DC. The new method can also be extended for\nuse in other regions.\nA feasible and true 3D model for groundwater flow is essential to groundwater\nresearch. This project attempts to establish a 3D model using discrete mathematics,\nespecially graphical and graph-theoretical methods, to compute groundwater flow. It is\ncalled the gradual variation method. This method can be combined with the existing\ntechnology such as MODFLOW for more accurate results. The research is focused on the\ngroundwater flow of the DC area. We have established a connection to use gradually\nvaried functions in groundwater research. We have accomplished three tasks: (1)\nextracting of real data from databases of DC areas, (2) storing the data into local\ndatabase, (3) reconstructing the water-head surfaces for time sequences using gradually\nvaried surface fitting. We have also completed the design of the combined gradually\nvaried fitting using the finite difference method.\nThe advantage of the gradually varied fitting and its related method does not need\nthe strictly defined boundary condition as it is required in MODFLOW.\nThe results of the research will provide a reliable source to better understand the\ngroundwater of DC. The images of data flow will indicate the activity of the groundwater\nflow. Beyond the theoretical achievements, the undergraduate and graduate students of\ncomputer science will have the opportunity to learn how to conduct state of the art\ngroundwater research and use various software systems. These students could work in the\nenvironmental sciences in the future.\n2. Problems and Methods\nIn order to use discrete methods for Groundwater Modeling, we need to solve the\nfollowing problems: (1) Groundwater flow equations and its discrete forms, (2)\nGradually varied functions for groundwater data, (3) Real data preparation, (4)\nAlgorithms, especially fast design, (5) Real data processing and applications.\nMuch research has already been done to find a discrete model for the groundwater flow\nequations. The research is mainly based on numerical methods and analytical methods.\nThe finite difference method (FDM) and the finite element method (FEM) are popular in\n\n2\n\n\fthis area. Pruist et al. [22] has indicated that FEM has advantages on local refinement of\ngrid (adaptive mesh generation) due to non-rectangular grids, good accuracy, stability,\nrepresentation of the spatial variation of anisotropy. However, its computational cost is\nmuch larger and relative less manageable in application. In fact, groundwater industry is\nnot like the automobile industry, there is no much need for a good-looking smoothed\ngroundwater level surface.\nOn the other hand, FDM has simplicity of theory and algorithm, plus easiness of\napplication; however it has the problems of inefficient refinement of grid and poor\ngeometry representation. This is because of the strict use of rectangular grids. In addition,\nthere is no standard method to implement the Neumann boundary condition.\nThe gradually varied function is supposed to pick up the advantages and overcome the\ndisadvantages in FEM and FDM. So our first task is to investigate the suitableness of\ngradually varied functions for groundwater data. Then, we must find a connection\nbetween the flow equations and gradually varied functions. We also need to design an\ninput data format to store the data in a database.\nA gradually varied function is for the discrete system where a high level of\nsmoothness is not a dominant factor. It can be used in any type of decomposition of the\ndomain. It is more flexiable than rectangle-cells used in MODFLOW and triangle-cells\nused in FEFLOW. Because gradual variation does not have strict system requirements,\nthe other mathematical methods and the artificial intelligence methods can be easily\nincorprated into this method to seek a better solution. Based on the boundary conditions\nor constraints of the groundwater aquifer, the constraints could be in explicit forms or in\ndifferential forms such as the diffusion equations. The gradually varied function exists\nbased on the following theorem: The necessary and sufficient condition of the existance\nof a gradually varied function is that the change of values in any pair of sample points is\nsmaller or equal to the distance of the points in the pair.\n3. Background and Related Research\nThe research of groundwater flow is one of the major topics in groundwater\nresearch [1] [2] (this sentence does not make sense and just repeats itself). The\ngroundwater flow equation based on Darcy's Law usually describes the movement of\ngroundwater in a porous medium such as aquifers. It is known in mathematics as the\ndiffusion equation. The Laplace equation (for a steady-state flow) is a simplification of\nthe diffusion equation under the condition that the aquifer has a recharging boundary. The\nconservation of mass states that for a given increment of time (\u2206t) \"the difference\nbetween the mass flowing in across the boundaries, the mass flowing out across the\nboundaries, and the sources within the volume, is the change in storage.\"[2]\n(1)\nIts differential form is\n\n3\n\n\f(2)\nTo solve this equation, a grid method is usually used, such as the finite difference or\nfinite element method [3] [4]. Other methods including the analytic element method\nattempt to solve the equation exactly, but need approximations of the boundary\nconditions [5][6]; they are mainly used in academic and research labs.\nThe practical way of calculating is to use numerical methods to solve these\nequations. The most popular system is called MODFLOW, which was developed by\nUSGS [7]. MODFLOW is based on the finite-difference method on rectangular Cartesian\ncoordinates. MODFLOW can be viewed as a \"quasi 3D\" simulation since it only deals\nwith the vertical average (no z-direction derivative). Flow calculations between the 2D\nhorizontal layers use the concept of leakage.\nGradual variation is a discrete method that can build on any decomposition or\nnetworking. It was originally introduced to solve image processing problems and\ndiscrete surface reconstruction [8][9][21]. See Fig 1. When a boundary is known, it can\nused to fit (solve) for the interal points in any type of linked connection. The original\nresearch\n\nFig. 1 Examples of gradually varied functions\nGradually Varied Surfaces of this project is to use Darcy's Law or differential constrains\nto determine the value of the unknown points instead of the random selection of the\nconstruction of gradually varied surfaces when there are more than one possible\nselections [10]. When the determination of the values are uncertain, we will try to use the\nartificial intelligence methods such as neural networks and genetic algorithms to help us\nto find near optimal solutions. These types of studies have already been done by many\nresearchers in groundwater flow [11][12].\nOn the other hand, current research still showed considerable interest in\nestablishing new modeling methods for groundwater flow [13-16]. Both the US and DC\ngovernments are concerned with the future of groundwater flow research [17][18]. This\nproject on the 3D models of groundwater flow has fundamental and practical importance\nto hydrogeology. A method used to establish a true 3D model for groundwater flow will\nbe very useful to groundwater related research in DC and in other urban areas.\n4\n\n\f4. Data Preparation\nData Preparation is a very important part of this project, please see appendix or [20] for\nmore information. UDC student Branham has to use PHP to build a web application to\naccess groundwater log data in Virginia and Maryland. Data is stored in MySQL\ndatabases.\n\nFig. 2 Web based data collection\nThe application, in its current form, can be found at:\nhttp://www.travisbranham.com/waterquality/\n\n5. Ground Water Surface Fitting\nWe have done extensive research on data collection and initial data reconstruction\nusing gradually varied functions that are for the discrete system where a high level of\nsmoothness is not a dominant factor. Since they can be used on any type of\ndecomposition of the domain, gradually varied functions are more flexible than rectanglecells used in MODFLOW and triangle-cells used in FEFLOW.\nBecause gradual\n5\n\n\fvariation does not have strict system requirements, the other mathematical methods and\nthe artificial intelligence methods can be easily incorporated into this method to seek a\nbetter solution. Based on the boundary conditions or constraints of the groundwater\naquifer, the constraints could be in explicit forms or in differential forms such as the\ndiffusion equations. Again we select the gradually varied function because of the\nfollowing theorem: The necessary and sufficient condition of the existence of a gradually\nvaried function is that the change of values in any pair of sample points is smaller or\nequal to the distance of the points in the pair.\n5.1 Individual surface fitting\nGradual variation is a discrete method that can be built on any graph. The\ngradually varied surface is a special discrete surface. We now introduce this concept.\nThe Concept of Gradual Variation: Let function f: DAE{1, 2,...,n}, if a and b are\nadjacent in D implies |f(a)- f(b)| \u22641, point (a,f(a)) and (b,f(b)) are said to be gradually\nvaried. A 2D function (surface) is said to be gradually varied if every adjacent pair are\ngradually varied.\nDiscrete Surface Fitting: Given J\u2286D, and f: JAE{1,2,...n} decide if there is a F:\nDAE{1,2,...,n} such that F is gradually varied where f(x)=F(x), x in J.\nTheorem (Chen, 1989) The necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence\nof a gradually varied extension F is: for all x,y in J, d(x,y)\u2265 |f(x)-f(y)|, where d is the\ndistance between x and y in D.\nThe above theorem can be used for a single surface fitting if the condition in the\ntheorem is satisfied. The problem is that the sample data does not satisfy the condition of\nfitting. So the original algorithm cannot be used directly for individual surface fitting.\nAn algorithm (Algorithm A) based on the sample point contribution to the fitting\npoint is created. The core part of the program is given in the following code. This\nalgorithm can produce the surface but do not give good fit in some cases. We have\nshowed the result in the previous report.\n\n6\n\n\fAlgorithm A:\nz\nfor (k=0;k<nGuildPoints;k++){\nz\nii=(latIndex[k]-latMin)/latDet;\nz\njj=(longtIndex[k]-longtMin)/longtDet;\ndistance=sqrt((ii -i)*(ii-i)+(jj -j)*(jj-j));\ntemp_j=abs((array[i][j] - dat[k][time]))/Ratio-distance;\nif(temp_j>0){ // not satisfy gvs condition\n\nz\nz\n\nif( array[i][j] > dat[k][time])\ntemp=-temp_j *Ratio ;\nelse\ntemp= temp_j *Ratio;\narray[i][j]=array[i][j]+temp ;\n\nz\nz\nz\nz\nz\nz\n\n}\n\nz\n\nA new algorithm was developed recently to overcome these problems [23]. In [23], a\nsystematic digital-discrete method for obtaining continuous functions with smoothness to\na certain order (C^n) from sample data is designed. This method is also based on\ngradually varied functions. The new algorithm tries to search for a best solution of the\nfitting. We have added the component of the classical finite difference method. The result\nof the new method will be shown in following sections. This method is independent from\nexisting popular methods such as the cubic spline method and the finite element method.\nThe new digital-discrete method has considerable advantages for a large amount of real\ndata applications. This digital method also differs from other classical discrete method\nthat usually uses triangulations. This method can potentially be used to obtain smooth\nfunctions such as polynomials through its derivatives f^{(k)} and the solution for partial\ndifferential equations such as harmonic and other important equations.\n\n5.2 Sequential surface fitting and involvement of the flow equation\nThe individual surface fitting in the above code is not an adequate method since\nthe relationship of groundwater surfaces at each time is not accounted for in the\ncalculation. In particular, we have to use the flow equation in the sequential surface\ncalculation.\nAccording to flow equation (2),\nh2-h1 = alpha*(h2(x-1,y)+h2(x+1,y)-2h2(x,y)+\nh2(x,y-1)+h2(x,y+1)-2h2(x,y)) \u2013G\n\n(3)\n\n7\n\n\fWe can let\nf4= (h2(x,y)-h1(x,y)+G)/alpha + 4*h2(x,y) =\nh2(x-1,y)+h2(x+1,y)+ h2(x,y-1)+h2(x,y+1).\n\n(4)\n\nf4 can also be viewed as the average of 4 times the center point. Using the gradually\nvaried function, the average is ((h2-h1+G)/alpha + 4*h2(x,y))/4. Based on the properties\nof gradually varied functions, the maximum difference is three. For example, h2_old(x1),y) is bigger , then h2_new(x-1),y) should be smaller.\nThe iterating procedure is to update the center point after the first fit.\n6. Real Data Processing and Application\nThis results use an algorithm to fit the initial data set using an individualized fit,\nsee Fig 3. This algorithm is also made by the rough graduate varied surface fitting by\nscanning through the fitting array. There are many clear boundary lines in the images. In\norder to reduce error, our new algorithm will use more accurate formulas to calculate the\nderivatives (1):\nCS-UDC\n\nCS-UDC\n\nFig. 3 Gradually varied functions for initial surface\nFig.4 shows the sequential surface fitting and the water flow equation updating.\nIndividual surface fitting results are shown in (a), (b), and (c).

The brighter pixels mean the deeper distance from the surface. In\nmountain area, the groundwater level is lower in general. Some mismatches may be\ncaused by not having enough sample data points (wells).\nFuture work: to ensure the accuracy of the calculation, we will add the finite\nelement method to our research. We also want to use MODEFLOW to calculate local and\nsmall-region flow, and to use gradual variation to compute regional or global data.\nAcknowledgement: This research was supported by USGS seed grants.
