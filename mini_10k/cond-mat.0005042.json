The power\nspectrum a(\u03c9, t) describes the decay with time t of the\nenvelope of the oscillations with frequency \u03c9. It is a basic\ndynamical observable in optics, acoustics, and seismology\n[1]. In the seismological context, the attention has focused on randomly layered media, which are a model for\nthe subsurface of the Earth. The fundamental result of\nWhite, Sheng, Zhang, and Papanicolaou [2] for this problem is that a(\u03c9, t) decays as t\u22122 for times long compared\nto the scattering time \u03c4s at frequency \u03c9. The dynamics\non this time scale is governed by localisation, since the\nproduct of \u03c4s and the wave velocity c equals the localisation length in one dimension. Although this result for the\npower spectrum is more than a decade old, it has thus far\nresisted an extension beyond one-dimensional scattering.\n\nLet us first formulate the problem more precisely. We\nconsider the reflection of a scalar wave (frequency \u03c9) from\na disordered region (length L, mean free path l = c\u03c4s )\nembedded in an N -mode waveguide (see Fig. 1, inset).\nWe assume that the length L is greater than the localisation length \u03be = N l, so that transmission through the\ndisordered region can be ignored. If in addition the absorption length is greater than \u03be, the reflection matrix\nr(\u03c9) can be regarded as unitary. The matrix product\nC(\u03c9, \u03b4\u03c9) = r\u2020 (\u03c9 \u2212 12 \u03b4\u03c9) r(\u03c9 + 21 \u03b4\u03c9)\n\n(1)\n\nis unitary for unitary r, so that its eigenvalues are phase\nfactors exp(i\u03c6n ).\nThe power spectrum for a pulse incident in mode n\nand detected in mode m is related to C by\nZ \u221e\na(\u03c9, t) =\nd\u03b4t ei\u03c9\u03b4t hrmn (t)rmn (t + \u03b4t)i\n\u2212\u221e\nZ\n1 \u221e d\u03b4\u03c9 \u2212it\u03b4\u03c9\ne\nhTr C(\u03c9, \u03b4\u03c9)i.\n(2)\n=\nN \u2212\u221e 2\u03c0\nR\n(We have normalised dt a(\u03c9, t) = 1.) The phase shifts\nhave the joint distribution function P (\u03c61 , \u03c62 , . . . , \u03c6N ).\nTo calculate the average of Tr\nto know the\nR C it suffices\nR\none-point function\n\u03c1(\u03c6\n)\n=\nN\nd\u03c6\n.\n.\n.\nd\u03c6\nP (\u03c6), since\n1\n2\nN\nR\nhTr Ci = d\u03c6 \u03c1(\u03c6)ei\u03c6 . We will present two different\nmethods of exact solution. The first method [9] (based\non analytic continuation) is simple but restricted to the\none-point function, while the second method [2] (based\non a Fokker-Planck equation) is more complicated but\ngives the entire distribution function.\nAnalytic continuation to the imaginary frequency difference \u03b4\u03c9 = i/\u03c4a relates exp (i\u03c6n ) to the reflection eigenvalue Rn of an absorbing medium with absorption time\n\u03c4a . The one-point functions are related by\n\nWork towards such an extension by Papanicolaou and\ncoworkers [3,4] has concentrated on locally layered media, in which the scattering is one-dimensional on short\nlength scales and three-dimensional on long length scales.\nThis is most relevant for seismological applications. Recent dynamical microwave experiments by Genack et al.\n[5] have motivated us to look at this problem in a waveguide geometry, in which the scattering is fully threedimensional - but restricted to a finite number N of\npropagating waveguide modes. (The single-mode case\nN = 1 is statistically equivalent to the one-dimensional\nmodel of Ref. [2].) We find that the long-time decay\nof the average power spectrum is a power law as in the\none-dimensional case, but with two exponents: a decay\n\u221d t\u22123/2 crosses over to a t\u22122 decay after a characteristic time tc \u221a\n= N 2 \u03c4s . The corresponding characteristic\nlength scale Dtc (with diffusion constant D) is the localisation length in an N -mode waveguide. The crossover\nis therefore a dynamical signature of localisation in the\nreflectance of a random medium, distinct from the signature in the transmittance (or conductance) considered\npreviously in the literature [6\u20138].\n\n\u221e\n\nX\nN\n1\n\u03c1(\u03c6) =\n+ Re\ne\u2212in\u03c6\n2\u03c0 \u03c0\nn=1\n\nZ1\n\nRn \u03c1(R) dR.\n\n(3)\n\n0\n\nThis is a quick and easy way to solve the problem, since\n\u03c1(R) is known exactly as a series of Laguerre polynomials\n1\n\n\f[10]. The method of analytic continuation is restricted to\nthe one-point function because averages of negative powers of exp (i\u03c6n ) are not analytic in the reflection eigenvalues [9]. For example, for the two-point function one\nwould need to know the average hexp (i\u03c6n \u2212 i\u03c6m )i \u2192\n\u22121\nhRn Rm\ni that diverges in the absorbing problem.\nThe calculation of the power spectrum from Eqs. (2)\nand (3) is easiest in the absence of time-reversal symmetry, because \u03c1(R) then has a particularly simple form\n[10]. We obtain the power spectrum\n\u0013\n\u0012\nt\nd\n\u22121\n,\n(4a)\na(\u03c9, t) = \u2212N \u03b8(t) F\ndt\n2N \u03b1\u03c4s\n\u0013n \u0012 2\n\u0013\nN \u22121 \u0012\nt +1\n1 X t\u22121\n,\n(4b)\nPn 2\nF (t) =\nt + 1 n=0 t + 1\nt \u22121\n\nWe defined the dimensionless frequency increment \u2206 =\n\u03b1\u03c4s \u03b4\u03c9 and abbreviated c\u03b2 = 12 \u03b2(N \u2212 1) + 1. The index\n\u03b2 = 1(2) in the presence (absence) of time-reversal symmetry. We emphasise that, although the Fokker-Planck\nequation can be obtained by analytic continuation, its\nsolution cannot. Indeed, this would give the solution\nP \u221d e\u03a9 , that fails because it is not normalisable.\nWe proceed\nas\n\u0002\n\u0003 in Ref. [11] by substituting P (z) =\n\u03a8(z) exp 12 \u03a9(z) , in order to transform the FokkerPlanck equation (7) into the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nN h\nX\n\ni\nX\n\u22022\n+\nV\n(z\n)\n+\nU\n(z\n,\nz\n)\n\u03a8 = 0,\n(8a)\nn\nn m\n\u2202zn2\nn=1\nm6=n\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\n1\n\u2206\n2\n2\ncosh z \u2212 \u2206 sinh z +\nV (z) = c\u03b2\n+ V0 ,\n4\n4 cosh2 z\n\nwhere Pn is a Legendre polynomial and \u03b8(t) is the unit\nstep function. The coefficient \u03b1 = 2, \u03c0 2 , 8/3 for dimensionality d = 1, 2, 3. In the single-mode case Eq. (4)\nsimplifies to\na(\u03c9, t) = 4\u03c4s (\u03c9)[t + 4\u03c4s (\u03c9)]\u22122 \u03b8(t),\n\nU (z, z \u2032 ) =\n\n(5)\n\nN\n\n\u03a8(z) = Det {\u03c8\u03bcn (zm )}n,m=1 ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere I1 is a modified Bessel function. The power spectrum now decays aspt\u22123/2 . For any finite N we find a\ncrossover from a = \u03b1\u03c4s /2\u03c0 t\u22123/2 for \u03c4s \u226a t \u226a N 2 \u03c4s to\na = 2N \u03b1\u03c4s t\u22122 for t \u226b N 2 \u03c4s .\nIn the presence of time-reversal symmetry the exact\nexpression for a(\u03c9, t) is more cumbersome but the asymptotics carries over with minor modifications. In particular, the large-N limit (6) with its t\u22123/2 decay remains the\nsame, while the t\u22122 decay changes only in the prefactor:\na = (N + 1)\u03b1\u03c4s t\u22122 for t \u226b N 2 \u03c4s .\nWe now turn to the second method of solution, based\non a Fokker-Planck equation for the entire distribution\nfunction P (\u03c6). The equation for N = 1 was derived in\nRef. [2]. The multi-mode generalisation can be obtained\nmost directly by analytic continuation of the FokkerPlanck equation for the probability distribution of the reflection eigenvalues - which is known [10]. The resulting\nFokker-Planck equation for the phase shifts takes a simple form in the variable z = ln cotan (\u03c6/4) \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, \u221e)\nfor \u03c6 \u2208 (0, 2\u03c0).

The bottom of the well\nis positive for sufficiently large \u2206, so that the real spectrum contains only positive \u03bcn 's. How then are we to\nsatisfy the condition of zero sum of the eigenvalues? The\nway out of this impasse is to allow for complex eigenvalues. The corresponding eigenfunctions will not be square\nintegrable, but that is not a problem as long as the probability distribution P (z) remains normalisable. This is a\nnew twist to the active field of non-Hermitian quantum\nmechanics [12].\nThe differential equation (10) is known as the confluent Heun equation [13], but we have found no mention of\nthe complex spectrum in the mathematical physics literature - perhaps because it was considered unphysical.\nThe complex spectrum is constructed by means of a complete set of polynomials to order N \u2212 1,\n\n(7a)\n\n(ln cosh zn \u2212 c\u03b2 \u2206 sinh zn )\n\nX\n\ncosh2 z + cosh2 z \u2032\n1\n.\n\u03b2(\u03b2 \u2212 2)\n2\n(sinh z \u2212 sinh z \u2032 )2\n\n1 2\nHere V0 = 12\n\u03b2 (N \u2212 1)(N \u2212 2 + 6/\u03b2) + 41 . By restricting\nourselves to \u03b2 = 2, the interaction term U vanishes and\nEq. (8) has the form of a one-dimensional free-fermion\nproblem. The general solution is given by the Slater determinant\n\nwhich is the result of White et al. [2]. It decays as t\u22122 .\nFor N \u2192 \u221e Eq.

(18)\n\nThis is the exact solution of Eq. (7) for \u03b2 = 2. Correlation functions of arbitrary order can be obtained from\nEq. (18) in terms of a series of the bi-orthogonal functions A\u03bc and B\u03bc [14,15]. For example, the density of\neigenphases \u03c1(\u03c6) is given by\nN\ndx X\nA\u03bc (x)B\u03bcn (x).\nd\u03c6 n=1 n\n\nn<m\n\nN\nY\n\ne\u2212N \u2206 xi \u03b8(xi ).\n\n(21)\n\ni=1\n\nY\n\nn<m\n\nei\u03c6n \u2212 ei\u03c6m\n\n2\n\n,\n\n(22)\n\nwhich we recognize as the circular ensemble of randommatrix theory [17]. This is as expected, since for large \u03b4\u03c9\nthe matrix C is the product of two independent reflection\nmatrices r, each of which is uniformly distributed in the\nunitary group. The circular ensemble is the corresponding distribution of the eigenphases.\nThe intermediate regime l \u226a L\u03b4\u03c9 \u226a \u03be, or N \u22122 \u226a\n\u2206 \u226a 1, is the diffusive one. To study this regime we\nmake a WKB approximation of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation (10). This approximation requires N 2 \u2206 \u226b 1 and\nN \u226b 1, hence it contains both the ballistic and the diffusive regimes. We obtain\n\n(17)\n\nor, in terms of the variable x = sinh z = cotan (\u03c6/2),\n\n\u03c1(\u03c6) =\n\n(xn \u2212 xm )2\n\nP (\u03c6) \u221d\n\ni=1\n\n\u00d7 Det {B\u03bcn (sinh zm )}N\nn,m=1 ,\n\nY\n\nThis is the Laguerre ensemble of random-matrix theory.\nThe distribution is dominated by x = cotan (\u03c6/2) \u226b 1,\nso that one can replace xn \u2192 2/\u03c6n and recover the result\n[18] that the inverse time delays, 1/\u03c4n \u2261 lim\u03b4\u03c9\u21920 \u03b4\u03c9/\u03c6n ,\nare distributed according to the Laguerre ensemble. The\ncondition \u2206N 2 \u226a 1 for Laguerre\np statistics means that\nthe characteristic length L\u03b4\u03c9 = D/\u03b4\u03c9 associated with\nthe frequency increment \u03b4\u03c9 is greater than the localisation length \u03be. We therefore refer to the regime of validity\nof Eq. (21) as the localised regime.\nAt the opposite extreme we have the ballistic regime\nL\u03b4\u03c9 \u226a l, or \u2206 \u226b 1. The integral (14) is now dominated by x\u2032 \u226a 1, hence B\u03bc (x) \u221d (x2 + 1)\u22121 A\u22121\n\u03bc (x).\nMoreover, the off-diagonal elements of the matrix M\nmay be neglected so that the polynomials have a\nsimple structure: A\u03bcn (x) \u221d (x + i)N \u2212n (x \u2212 i)n\u22121 .\nThe corresponding functions B are given by B\u03bcn (x) =\nsinN +1 (\u03c6/2) exp [i\u03c6(n \u2212 N \u2212 12 )]. The resulting distribution of the eigenphases in the ballistic regime is\n\n\u2032\n\ne\u2212N \u2206 x\nA\u22122 (x \u2212 x\u2032 ) dx\u2032 . (14)\n(x \u2212 x\u2032 )2 + 1 \u03bc\n\nThe functions A\u03bc and B\u03bc form a bi-orthogonal set on the\nreal axis. We choose the normalisation such that\nZ \u221e\n(15)\ndx A\u03bcn (x)B\u03bcm (x) = \u03b4nm .\n\nY\n\n(20)\n\nHere \u03b6 = 4i\u03c4s \u03b4\u03c9(1 \u2212 ei\u03c6 )\u22121 and Ei is the exponentialintegral function. For N > 1 the eigenvalues \u03bcn remain real for \u2206N 2 \u226a 1. In this regime the integral (14) is easily evaluated, because one can substitute effectively [(x \u2212 x\u2032 )2 + 1]\u22121 \u2192 \u03c0\u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 ). Hence\nB\u03bc (x) \u221d exp (\u2212N \u2206 x)A\u03bc (x) \u03b8(x). Using again Eq. (16),\nwe obtain\n\nP\n\nZ\u221e\n\n2\n\u03c4s \u03b4\u03c9(1 \u2212 cos \u03c6)\u22121 Im e\u03b6 Ei (\u2212\u03b6), .\n\u03c0\n\n(19)\n\n\u03c8\u03bcI,II (z) = c(\u03bc) (V (z) \u2212 \u03bc)\u22121/4 e\n3\n\n\u00b1\n\nRz\n0\n\ndu\n\n\u221a\n\nV (u)\u2212\u03bc\n\n, (23)\n\n\ftime \u03c4s , and frequency difference \u03b4\u03c9. With increasing\n\u03b4\u03c9 the distribution crosses over from the Laguerre ensemble in the localised regime (\u03b4\u03c9 \u226a 1/N 2 \u03c4s ) to the\ncircular ensemble in the ballistic regime (\u03b4\u03c9 \u226b 1/\u03c4s ), via\nan intermediate \"diffusive\" regime. The distribution in\nthis intermediate regime does not have the form of any\nof the ensembles known from random-matrix theory and\ndeserves further study.\nThis work grew out of an initial investigation of the\nsingle-mode case with K.

The \"+\" sign\nin the exponent refers to \u03c8\u03bcII and the \"\u2212\" sign to \u03c8\u03bcI .\nThe eigenvalues \u03bcn densely fillPa curve RC in the complex plane. We may substitute \u03bc f\u03bc \u2192 C \u03c1(\u03bc)f (\u03bc) d\u03bc,\nwhere \u03c1(\u03bc) = N [4\u03c0ic2 (\u03bc)]\u22121 is the eigenvalue density.\nFor analytic f (\u03bc), the integral along C depends only on\nthe end points \u03bc\u00b1 = N 2 ( 13 \u00b1 i\u2206) of the curve. From Eqs.\n(13), (19) and (23) we obtain the eigenphase density\nq\nN\nIm\n\u22062 + 2i\u2206(1 \u2212 e\u2212i\u03c6 ). (24)\n\u03c1(\u03c6) =\n4\u03c0 sin2 (\u03c6/2)\nThis result can be obtained also from Eq. (3) in the limit\nN \u2192 \u221e. It is derived here for \u03b2 = 2, but is actually \u03b2independent. (The \u03b2-dependent corrections in the diffusive regime are due to weak localisation, and are smaller\nby a factor 1/N .) One can check that \u03c1(\u03c6) \u2192 N/2\u03c0\nfor \u2206 \u226b 1, as expected in the ballistic regime.
