The di\u001berential \u001dow equations of the Wilson renormalization group [1\u2104 appear for the \u001crst time in a paper of Wegner and Houghton [2\u2104 in 1972. In a seminal\npaper by Pol hinski [3\u2104 in 1984 a renormalization proof for s alar \u03c644 -theory was performed. It is based\non the observation that the \u001dow equations give a ess to a tight indu tive s heme wherefrom bounds on\nthe regularized S hwinger fun tions implying renormalizability may be dedu ed. The S hwinger fun tions\nare regularized by an U V - uto\u001b \u039b0 and by an infrared uto\u001b \u039b, the \u001dow parameter. The bounds on these\nS hwinger fun tions obtained in [4\u2104 are uniform in the UV uto\u001b and \u001cnite for \u039b \u2192 0. This basi ally solves\nthe renormalization problem. Later on renormalization theory with \u001dow equations was extended in various\ndire tions, for a re ent review overing some of the rigorous work see [5\u2104. Among the issues treated are the\nrenormalization of omposite operators and the short distan e expansion, sharp bounds on the S hwinger\nfun tions, massless theories, the transition to Minkowski spa e, the treatment of abelian and nonabelian\ngauge theories and \u001celd theories at \u001cnite temperatures.\nI will adress subsequently massive Eu lidean \u03c644 -theory. I \u001crst outline the simplest version of the renormalization proof based on relatively rude bounds on the regularized S hwinger fun tions. Then I present\nsharpened versions of these bounds in momentum and position spa e. Hereafter analyti ity properties of the\nS hwinger fun tions and statements on renormalizability in Minkowski spa e are presented. These notes end\nwith a short overview on further rigorous results obtained in the \u001dow equation framework.\nColleagues I had the pleasure to work with on renormalization theory with \u001dow equations are Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ri\nMeunier, Walter Pedra, Thomas Reisz, Manfred Salmhofer, Clemens S hophaus and Vladimir Smirnov. In\nparti ular I am grateful for the fruitful long term ollaborations with Georg Keller and Volkhard M\u00fcller.\n2\n\nRENORMALIZATION of\n\n\u03c644 -THEORY\n\nMassive Eu lidean \u03c644 -theory is the simplest theory on whi h the general issues of renormalization theory\nan be studied. When one analyzes the divergen e stru ture of its bare Feynman amplitudes one fa es\nthe problem to be solved by general renormalization theory, namely the so- alled overlapping divergen es\nwhi h had paved the way to a rigorous theory of renormalization with so many di\u001e ulties during the \u001crst\nfew de ades of existen e of perturbative quantum \u001celd theory. The most astonishing message from the\n\u001dow equation framework is that the fo us on overlapping divergen es and the heavy ombinatorial and\nanalyti al ma hinery employed for its solution are not intrinsi to the problem2 . In the \u001dow equation\napproa h overlapping divergen es do not leave any tra e.\n2.1\n\nThe basi\n\ntools\n\nThe bare propagator of the theory is repla ed by a regularized \u001dowing propagator\nC \u039b,\u039b0 (p) =\n\n\u2212p\n1\n{e\n2\n2\np +m\n\n2 +m2\n\u039b2\n0\n\n\u2212 e\u2212\n\np2 +m2\n\u039b2\n\n},\n\n0 \u2264 \u039b \u2264 \u039b0 \u2264 \u221e .\n\nThe full propagator is re overed by taking the regulator \u039b0 to \u221e and the \u001dow parameter \u039b to 0 . We\nal ulate the derivative of C \u039b,\u039b0 as\n\u010a \u039b (p) = \u2202\u039b C \u039b,\u039b0 (p) = \u2212\n2\n\nThis is of\n\nourse is of no\n\nrenormalization theory.\n\n2\n2 \u2212 p2 +m\ne \u039b2 .\n3\n\u039b\n\nonsequen e as for the merit atta hed to the hard and profound work done in early rigorous\n\n\f2 RENORMALIZATION of\n\n3\n\n\u03c644 -THEORY\n\nSubsequently we will denote by d\u03bc\u039b,\u039b0 the Gaussian measure with ovarian e ~ C \u039b,\u039b0 . The parameter ~ is\nintrodu ed as usual to obtain a systemati expansion in the number of loops.\nThe theory we want to study is massive Eu lidean \u03c644 -theory. This means that we start from the bare a tion\nL0 (\u03c6) =\n\nZ\n\nd4 x {\n\ng 4\n\u03c6 + a0 \u03c62 + b0 (\u2202\u03bc \u03c6)2 + c0 \u03c64 }\n4!\nb0 = O(~2 ) .\n\na0 , c0 = O(~) ,\n\nFrom the bare a tion and the \u001dowing propagator we may de\u001cne Wilson's \u001dowing e\u001be tive a tion L\u039b,\u039b0 by\nintegrating out momenta in the region \u039b2 \u2264 p2 \u2264 \u039b20 . It is de\u001cned through\n1\n\ne\u2212 ~ L\n\n\u039b,\u039b0\n\n(\u03c6)\n\n:= N\n\nZ\n\n1\n\nd\u03bc\u039b,\u039b0 (\u03c6) e\u2212 ~ L0 (\u03c6 + \u03c6)\n\nand an be re ognized to be the generating fun tional of the onne ted free propagator amputated S hwinger\nfun tions of the theory with propagator C \u039b,\u039b0 and bare a tion L0 . For the normalization fa tor N to be \u001cnite\nwe have to restri t the theory to \u001cnite volume. All subsequent formulae are valid also in the thermodynami\nlimit sin e they do not involve any more the va uum fun tional or partition fun tion.\nThe fundamental tool for our study of the renormalization problem is then the fun tional Flow Equation\n\u2202\u039b L\u039b,\u039b0 =\n\n1 \u03b4L\u039b,\u039b0 \u039b \u03b4L\u039b,\u039b0\n\u03b4\n~ \u03b4\nh , \u010a \u039b\niL\u039b,\u039b0 \u2212 h\n, \u010a\ni.\n2 \u03b4\u03c6\n\u03b4\u03c6\n2\n\u03b4\u03c6\n\u03b4\u03c6\n\nIt is obtained by deriving both sides of the previous equation w.r.t. \u039b and performing an integration by\nparts in the fun tional integral on the r.h.s.

The important\n\n\f5\n\n\u03c644 -THEORY\n\n2 RENORMALIZATION of\n\npoint to note on this indu tion hypothesis is that it is independent of (and thus uniform in) the UV uto\u001b\n\u039b0 . This means that its veri\u001c ation implies essentially the solution of the renormalization problem. We\nshortly des ribe the\n\nMethod of proof :\n\nThe indu tion hypothesis is proven by \u001crst verifying it for the boundary onditions spe i\u001ced previously and\nthen by inserting it on the right hand side of the \u001dow equation bounding the integrals in an elementary way.\nOn has to distinguish irrelevant terms with n + |w| \u2265 5 whi h are integrated downwards from \u039b0 to \u039b and\nrelevant terms whi h are integrated upwards from 0 to \u039b . We note that the relevant terms are imposed by\nthe renormalization onditions at \u001cxed external momentum. To move away from the renormalization point\none uses the S hl\u00f6mil h interpolation formula, e.g. for theZ two-point fun tion\n\u039b,\u039b0\n0\nL\u039b,\u039b\nl,2 (p) = Ll,2 (0) +\n\nX\n\n1\n\np\u03bc\n\n\u03bc\n\nd\u03bb (\n\n0\n\n\u2202 \u039b,\u039b0\n) (\u03bbp) ,\nL\n\u2202p\u03bc l,2\n\n\u039b,\u039b0\n\u039b,\u039b0\n\u2202\n\u2202\n0\nand similar formulas where L\u039b,\u039b\nl,2 (p) is repla ed by \u2202p\u03bc Ll,2 (p) or by \u2202p\u03bc \u2202p\u03bd Ll,2 (p) . When applying\nthree derivatives to the two-point fun tion or one derivative to the four-point fun tion the ontribution beomes irrelevant and is integrated downwards from \u039b0 . In this way the analogue of the previous equation\n2\n0\nwritten for \u2202p\u03bc\u2202\u2202p\u03bd L\u039b,\u039b\nl,2 (p) gives full ontrol of the twi e derived two-point fun tion.

By Eu lidean invarian e one realizes that no renormalization onditions\nare needed for terms whi h are not s alars w.r.t. this symmetry.

One might note that\n\n\f2 RENORMALIZATION of\n\n6\n\n\u03c644 -THEORY\n\nthis generalization is of pra ti al importan e on one hand, sin e su h irrelevant terms typi ally will appear,\ne.g. in e\u001be tive a tions used to des ribe riti al behaviour in statisti al me hani s [6\u2104. On an al ulate\nsubdominant orre tions to s aling near se ond order phase transitions due to su h terms.\nOn the other hand these terms pose onsiderable problems in the BPHZ type renormalization proofs of whi h\nwe are not sure whether they have been solved in full rigour up the present day [7\u2104.\nIt is also possible to give mu h sharper bounds on the S hwinger fun tions with the aid of the \u001dow\nequations whi h do not only imply renormalizability but also restri t the high momentum or large distan e\nbehaviour of the S hwinger fun tions in a basi ally optimal way (in the sense that they are saturated by\nindividual Feynman amplutudes). To phrase those bounds we need the following on ept of\n\nWeighted trees:\n\nWe regard trees with n external lines and V verti es of oordination number 3 or 4. To the n external lines of a\ntree T we asso iate n external in oming momenta p~ = (p1 , . . . , pn ) respe tively positions ~x = (x1 , . . . , xn ) .\nWe then de\u001cne weight fa tors in momentum and position spa e.\n\nWeight fa tor in momentum spa e :\n\nTo ea h internal line I \u2208 I of the tree is atta hed a weight \u03bc(I) \u2208 {1, 2} su h that I\u2208I \u03bc(I) = n \u2212 4 .

These derivatives ne essarily\nappear due to the use of the S hl\u00f6mil h interpolation formula. Here the main problem to solve is to \u001cnd\noptimal paths in the interpolation formula for the four point fun tion so as to avoid that derivatives only\nlead to a net gain of a small external momentum only whereas subsequent appli ation of the interpolation\nformula then may lead to multipli ation by a large one.

In our\nframework we address the relativisti renormalization problem in momentum spa e, and we want to re over\nthe results from BPHZ renormalization theory saying that the perturbative relativisti Green fun tions are\ndistributions in momentum spa e, and at the same time analyti fun tions in those domains where the\nexternal in oming energy stays below the physi al thresholds. For a fully satisfa tory renormalization theory\nin Minkowski spa e one would also like to have ontinuity properties of the Green fun tions above threshold,\nsu\u001e ient at least to de\u001cne a physi al renormalized oupling for physi al values of the external momenta\nwhi h ne essarily lie above threshold.

One of the earliest appli ations of Pol hinski's method was by Mitter and Ramadas [13\u2104, who gave a\nrenormalization proof for the two-dimesnional nonlinear \u03c3-model on the ultraviolet side.\n2. Massless theories [14\u2104\nMassles theories or partially massless theories have been treated in momentum spa e. In this ase the\nindu tive bounds of ourse have to allow for the singularities present in the onne ted S hwinger fun tions\nat ex eptional external momentum, i.e. when subsums of external momenta vanish. One then has to \u001cnd\nand prove bounds whi h hara terize these singularities in a basi ally optimal way so that the su essive\nintegration pro edures of the \u001dow equation reveal how the possible singularities disappear when passing from\nLl\u22121,n+2 to Ll,n . We think that a better and more transparent way of treating this problem than that of [14\u2104\nis by the more re ent method of [8\u2104. There we give sharp large momentum bounds for the massive theory.\nIt should be possible to translate them to the massless theory, taking are of restri tions on the admissible\nrenormalization onditions in this ase.\n2. Composite Operators, Zimmermann identities [15\u2104 and the Wilson short distan e expansion [16\u2104\nThe renormalization of S hwinger fun tions with omposite operator insertions is an indispensable tool\nin many appli ations of renormalization theory. In parti ular in gauge theories these omposite operator\ninsertions appear as quantities whi h hara terize the violation of the Ward identities due to the presen e\nof uto\u001bs. Besides, inserted Green fun tions are of physi al interest in their own rigth, e.g. urrent- urrentorrelators in relativisti \u001celd theory, or the < \u03c62 \u03c62 >- orrelator from whi h one reads the behaviour of the\nspe i\u001c heat when applying Eu lidean \u001celd theory to riti al phenomena. The Zimmermann identities relate\nthese omposite operator insertions in di\u001berent renormalization s hemes with ea h other. They are obtained\nin a straightforward way from the linear stru ture of \u001dow equations for inserted Green fun tions. Having at\nhand the general omposite operator renormalziation te hniques one an then prove asymptoti expansions\nfor perturbative Green fun tions of the Wilson type. This has been done in Eu lidean spa e only.\n3. Gauge theories [17, 18\u2104\nWe mentioned that the Ward identities are violated in momentum spa e regulated gauge theories. In the \u001dow\nequation framework the renormalization of gauge theories then requires to prove that the Ward identities an\nbe restored in the limit where the uto\u001bs are taken away. To do so one disposes of the freedom of imposing\nrenormalization onditions on all relevant terms of the theory. This programme has been a hieved expli itly\nfor QED and for massive SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs theory.\n4. Finite temperature theory [19\u2104\nUsing \u001dow equations it is possible to study expli itly the di\u001beren e between the (massive Eu lidean s alar)\n\u001cnite temperature and zero temperature \u001celd theories and to show that this di\u001beren e theory is ompletely\nirrelevant in the sense of the renormalization group. That is to say, both theories (T > 0 and T = 0) are\nrenormalzied with identi al ounter terms. This result is new (though expe ted by experts) and its proof is\nsimple : our framework is parti ularly suited for this kind analysis where one has to lay hand on the bare\nand renormalized a tions at the same time, sin e both appear automati ally as opposite boundary values of\nthe \u001dow to be ontrolled.\nTwo further topi s of related nature have been treated within the \u001dow equation framework. First the\nSymanzik programme of improved improved a tions [20\u2104 has been arried out: it is possible to modify the\nbare a tion through irrelevant terms su h that the onvergen e of the regularized towards the renormalized\ntheory is a elerated, in terms of inverse powers of 1/\u039b0 . Se ondly de oupling theorems [21\u2104 for heavy\nparti les have been proven.\n\n\f4 A short look on further results\n\n11\n\nIn on lusion we may say that\n1. The Wilson-Wegner \u001dow equation allows for a simple transparent rigorous solution of the perturbative\nrenormalization problem, without introdu ing Feynman diagrams.\n2. The method gives new results and perspe tives on various aspe ts of the problem.\n3. It pla es the problem in a more general, more physi al and less te hni al ontext, relating perturbative\nand nonperturbative aspe ts.\nWe should also mention that \u001dow equations in di\u001berent forms and in various approximation s hemes are\npresently applied to many problems in high energy and solid state physi s, a topi not overed in this\nle ture.
