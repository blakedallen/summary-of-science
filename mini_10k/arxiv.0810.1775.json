The direction of the induced polarization is in the plane of the film and it\ndepends non-analitically on the corrugation wave vector k. The magnitude of the polarization can\nreach very high values in spite of being at least quadratic in atomic displacements due to BN sheets\nbeing able to tolerate large mechanical strains. The discovered effect can find many applications, in\nparticular, in a new type of efficient and reliable nanogenerators.\nPACS numbers: 61.46.Np, 77.55.+f, 77.80.-e, 77.84.-s\n\nThree-dimensional (3D) bulk crystals can generate a\nvoltage either in response to a mechanical strain \u2202i ul\n(piezoelectric effect [1, 2]) or to a strain gradient \u2202i \u2202j ul\n(flexoelectric effect [2, 3]), where u (r) is the displacement vector, with l its Cartesian index, \u2202i the gradient\noperator. The flexoelectric effect is usually small and\nevades experimental detection unless large strain gradients are externally imposed or artificially designed inhomogeneous metamaterials are used [3, 4]). It is commonly\nassumed that the effects nonlinear in \u2202i ul and \u2202i \u2202j ul on\na polarization are negligible in bulk dielectrics.\nContrary to 3D systems, sp2 -bonded 2D crystals, like\ngraphene and boron nitride (BN) [5, 6], are able to sustain much larger structural distortions and, thus, exhibit\nnew forms of electromechanical coupling. The BN sheet,\nfor example, becomes pyroelectric when it is wrapped\ninto a chiral or zigzag nanotube with the macroscopic\npolarization inversely proportional to the inverse square\nof the tube radius, 1/R2 , and directed along the tube\n[7, 8, 9]. Formally, this effect can be considered as a\nquadratic flexoelectric effect since 1/R2 is only a partic2\nular form of (\u2202i \u2202j uk ) .\nHere, we predict another unusual nonlinear electromechanical effect in 2D BN monolayer that has not been\nnoticed so far: generation of a macroscopic in-plane polarization in response to out-of-plane atomic displacements like the corrugation uz (r) = A sin(k * r + \u03c6),\nwhere k is the undulation wave vector, r is the in-plane\nvector, z\u2212axis is perpendicular to the plane, and \u03c6 is\nsome phase. Although such displacements have no inplane components and produce zero net curvature, they\nnevertheless induce an in-plane macroscopic polarization\nP (k) , which is purely electronic in origin and related to\nthe shifts of \u03c0 and \u03c3 chemical bonds. It is remarkable\nthat the induced polarization practically does not depend\non the phase \u03c6 but strongly depends on wave vector k,\nand there are some (\"optimal\") directions along which\nthe absolute value |P (k)| goes through a maximum. We\nshow further that being at least quadratic in amplitude\nof atomic displacements A, the corrugation-induced polarization is decomposed basically into a sum of two con2\ntributions associated with the quadratic terms (\u2202i uk )\n\n2\n\nand (\u2202i \u2202j uk ) , respectively. Whereas the first (\"piezoelectric\") contribution can be understood starting from\nthe piezoresponse of an isolated planar sheet, the second ( \"flexoelectric\") term has the same nature as the\ncurvature-induced polarization in BN nanotubes, where\nP \u221d 1/R2 .\nIt should be stressed that the discovered effect bears\nno relation to the formation of the normal polarization\ndue to bending of 2D systems like graphene flat sheets\nwhere P \u221d 1/R [10, 11]. From a more general point\nof view, the effect can be considered as a mechanicallyinduced improper ferroelectric phase transition, with A\nplaying a role of an order parameter. The externally imposed acoustic-phonon-like displacements uz (r) reduces\nthe initially nonpolar symmetry group to some lower polar subgroup, so that P (k) is expanded in powers of A\nbeginning with the term \u221d A2 . Although P (k) is at\nleast quadratic in A, the generated polarization can be\nvery large provided that A is a fraction of the wavelength\n2\u03c0/k. The effect may find a variety of practical applications and, in particularly, for conversion of the ambient\nwave-like micromovements into electricity: this tantalizing possibility is discussed below.\nAmong the truly 2D crystals that have been recently\nobtained using the so-called cleavage technique [12],\nboron-nitride monolayer is the only piezoelectric with\nwide band gap. Being partially ionic and partially covalent with sp2 -bonding, a flat BN sheet has a remarkable\nmechanical flexibility associated with the ease of forming\nintermediate sp2+\u03b1 bonds. Due to its D3h point symmetry group, it does not have a ground state polarization,\nalthough it exhibits piezoresponse with the piezoelectric\ntensor obeying the symmetry relations for the following\nnon-vanishing components:\nex,xx = \u2212ex,yy = \u2212ey,xy = \u2212ey,yx ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere x is directed along the symmetry axis of 2-th order\n[13].\nTo describe periodically and commensurately distorted\nhexagonal BN sheets, we introduce the corrugation wave\nvectors k as 2\u03c0e/\u03bb, where the unit vector e and wavelength \u03bb are expressed via the lattice vectors a1 and\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: Honeycomb BN lattice with basis vectors a1 and a2 .\nThe x axis is chosen to be parallel to (a1 +a2 ), whereas the\ny axis perpendiculat to it. The angle between the (a1 +a2 )\nand the chiral vector \u03bb is the polar angle \u03b8 used in the paper\nto describe the the corrugation wave vectors k=2\u03c0/\u03bb(n, m).\nThe example corresponds to the case of n = 3, m = 1.\n\na2 of a 2D sheet in the following\n\u221a way: e = \u03bb/\u03bb, with\n\u03bb(n, m) = na1 + ma2 , \u03bb = a n2 + nm + m2 , where n\nand m are integers, a1 = a2 = a (Fig. 1). Note that the\nvector \u03bb(n, m) coincides with the chiral or circumferential vector defined in the theory of carbon nanotubes [5].\nThe corrugation with the wave-length \u03bb(n, m) leads to\na rectangular supercell whose translational vectors are\n\u03bb(n, m) and some translation vector T = N a1 + M a2 ,\nwhich is\u221a perpendicular to \u03bb. The vector T with length\nT = a N 2 + N M + M 2 is completely defined by the\nvector \u03bb [18]:\n\u001a\nT =\n\n\u221a\n6 3pq,\n\u221a 3\u03bb/p, N \u2212 M =\n3\u03bb/ (3p) , N \u2212 M = 3pq,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere p is the greatest common divisor of N and M ,\nand q is an integer. It is also convenient to define the\nvectors k in the polar coordinate system, (k, \u03b8), where \u03b8\nis the angle between the k and (a1 + a2 ) [19]. We choose\n(a1 + a2 ) in such a way that the shortest interatomic\ndistance along this vector is passed from B to N atom\n(not from N to B, Fig. 1). Borrowing the terminology\nfrom the theory of nanotubes, we shall call the sine-wave\ndistortions with \u03b8 = 0 \u00b1 \u03c0l/3 the \"armchair\"-like and\nwith \u03b8 = \u03c0/6 \u00b1 \u03c0l/3 the \"zigzag\"-like, where l is an\ninteger. All other distortions falling between the two will\nbe called \"chiral\".\nTo calculate the corrugation-induced polarization, we\nuse the Berry-phase approach [14]. Namely, we treat the\nelectronic polarization as a geometrical phase accumulated by the occupied electrons in the slow (adiabatic)\n\nFIG. 2: A scheme showing the angular dependency of the\npolarization (depicted as arrows) induced by sinusoidal corrugations at a fixed \"amplitude-to-wave-length\" ratio Ak.\nWhile the k-vector scans the angle \u03b8 from 0 to 2\u03c0, the Cartesian components of the polarization change approximately as\n(\u2212 cos 2\u03b8, sin 2\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle defined in Fig. 1. Green\nsolid and blue dashed lines indicate the armchair and zigzag\ndirections along which the polarization is pure longitudinal\nand transverse, respectively.\n\nprocess of corrugation: P = P (u) - P (0) , with\nP (u) = \u2212\n\nM Z\nD\nE\n2ie X\n(u)\n(u)\n2\nd\nk\nu\n|\u2207\nu\nk\nnk\nnk ;\n(2\u03c0)2 n=1 BZ\n\n(3)\n\n(u)\n\nwhere unk is the periodic part of the Bloch functions\nand e is the electron charge. Note that the integral in\nthis expression is taken over 2D Brillouin zone, so that\nthe value of polarization has a dimension of a charge per\nunit length (electron charge per Bohr radius, e/aB , if\natomic units are used). Alternatively, in the simplest\ncase of isolated bands, the formula (3) can be cast as\n\nP (u) = \u2212\n\nM\n2e X (u)\nr ,\nS (u) n=1 n\n\n(4)\n\nwhere r n is the center of the Wannier function (WF)\ncorresponding to the occupied band n and S (u) =\n\u03bb T the P\nsurface area. Since the ionic contribution\n(u)\n(e/S (u) ) i Zi Ri\nto the total in-plane polarization\ndoes not change under the corrugations of interest, it\ncan be completely neglected.\nThe integrals P (u) (3) were computed using ABINIT\ncode [15] with a 12\u00d74\u00d71 Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid,\nwhere the largest number 12 corresponds to the direction of undulations \u03bb and 4 to the vector T , perpendicular to \u03bb. The flat and corrugated BN sheets were\nsimulated by a slab-supercell approach with the interplanar distances of 20aB and larger to ensure negligible\n\n\f3\nwave function overlap between the replica sheets. For the\nplane-wave expansion of the valence and conduction band\nwave-functions, a cutoff energy was used in the range of\n80-100 Ry, depending on the corrugation wave length \u03bb.\n(u)\nThe WFs and their geometrical centers r n [see (4)] have\nbeen calculated with the PWSCF package [16] in three\nsteps. First, we performed a self-consistent ground-state\ncalculation and then a non-self-consistent calculation at\nfixed k-points for all the occupied bands. And finally,\nthe obtained Bloch functions were transformed into maximally localized WFs (MLWFs) as described in Ref. [17].\nWe used \u03c0 and \u03c3 orbitals as initial guess projection functions allowing to obtain converged result for MLWFs .\nThere are N \u03c0-derived and 3 N \u03c3-derived WFs, where\nN is the number of B-N pairs per unit cell \u03bb\u00d7T.\nBefore describing the results of ab-initio modeling,\nwe shall derive a phenomenological expression for P (k)\nconsidering the BN sheet as a continuous elastic membrane, which appears to be very accurate. Obviously,\nin the long-wave length limit (k \u2192 0) the induced polarization can be expressed via 2D piezoelectric tensor\ncomponents ei,jk and pure shear deformations, because\nisotropic distortions do not contribute to the polarization of a flat BN. Substituting the displacement field\nuz (r) = A sin(k * r + \u03c6) into the standard deformation\ntensor of a membrane [20]\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202uj\n\u2202uz \u2202uz\n1 \u2202ui\n+\n+\n,\n(5)\n\u03b5ij =\n2 \u2202xj\n\u2202xi\n\u2202xi \u2202xj\nwhere xi = (x, y), one can easily find the net shear components \u03b7 = (\u03b5xx \u2212 \u03b5yy )/2 and \u03b3 = \u03b5xy = \u03b5yx as\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b5k cos 2\u03b8\n\u03b7\n=\n,\n(6)\n\u03b3\nsin 2\u03b8\n2\nwhere \u03b5k = A2 k 2 /4 is the net film stretch along the k\nassociated with the third term in Eq. (5) and \u03b8 is is the\nangle related to k the way shown in Fig. 1. The Cartesian components of polarization in the long wavelength\napproximation become Px = 2\u03b1\u03b7, Py = \u22122\u03b1\u03b3, where \u03b1\nis the 'clamped-ion' piezoelectric constant ex,xx of a flat\nBN sheet. Using these components and relation (6), the\nvector of polarization can be presented as\nP (k) = 2\u03b5k (ek cos 3\u03b8 \u2212 e\u22a5 sin 3\u03b8),\n\n(7)\n\nwhere ek and e\u22a5 are the unit vectors parallel\nand\u0003 per\u0002\npendicular to k (e\u22a5 are defined so that z * e\u22a5 \u00d7 ek > 0,\nzk [x \u00d7 y]). It is clear that the vector P (k) simply rotates with \u03b8 for the constant \u03b5k .\nBeing accurate in the long-wave length limit (k \u2192 0),\nthe formula (7) must be corrected for shorter wavelengths\nby supplementing the terms \u221d k 4 . The first such term\ncomes from the fact that the longitudinal component of\npolarization is tangent to the surface and tilted down\nand up relative to the initial (x, y)- plane. It, therefore, should be projected onto the plane, which has\nnot been taken into account in Eq. (7). To obtain\n\nthis correction, one should average over \u03bb the quantity 12 \u03b1A2 k 2 ek cos 3\u03b8 cos2 (k * r + \u03c6) [cos \u03b8(r) \u2212 1], where\n\u03b8(r) is the tilting angle. Noticing that cos \u03b8(r) \u2212 1 \u2248\n\u2212 21 A2 k 2 cos2 (k * r + \u03c6) one can easily find the average as\n3\n\u2212 32\n\u03b1A4 k 4 ek cos 3\u03b8.\nThe second correction accounts for the flexoelectric effect, i.e. the appearance of the macroscopic polarization\ndue to finite curvature like in BN nanotubes. By symmetry, such a polarization is maximal in amplitude for\nthe zigzag and minimal (zero) for the armchair directions; this angular dependence can be simply described\nby sin 3\u03b8. Besides, the polarization should be parallel to\ne\u22a5 , in close analogy with the tubes where the macroscopic polarization is always along the tube. And, finally, it should be proportional to the net inverse radius of curvature squared, 1/R2 , instead of 1/R2 in the\ntubes. Defining the principal local curvature along the k\nas \u22072 uz (r) = A k 2 sin(k * r+\u03c6) = 1/R(r), one can easily\nfind that 1/R2 \u2261 R\u22122 = A2 k 4 /2. Thus, the curvatureinduced correction can be represented as \u03b2 R\u22122 e\u22a5 sin 3\u03b8,\nwhere \u03b2 is the flexoelectric constant.\nBy adding the above corrections to the expression (7),\nwe come to the final result:\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0014 \u0012\n3\nP (k) = \u03b1\u03b5k ek 1 \u2212 \u03b5k cos 3\u03b8 \u2212 e\u22a5 sin 3\u03b8\n2\n+\u03b2R\u22122 e\u22a5 sin 3\u03b8.\n\n(8)\n\nThis formula is invariant with respect to rotation \u03b8 \u2192\n\u03b8 + 2\u03c0/3, as one would have expected from the D3h\nsymmetry. The first term comes from the increase in\nsurface area that accompanies the sine-wave atomic displacements, it represents the piezoelectric effect. The\nsecond term, on the contrary, is non-zero only due to finite averaged curvature squared, obviously, it renders the\nflexoelectric effect. Since \u03b1 < 0 and \u03b2 > 0, the extrema\nof the polarization are:\nPmax = |\u03b1|\u03b5k + \u03b2R\u22122 ,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3\nPmin = |\u03b1|\u03b5k 1 \u2212 \u03b5k ,\n2\n\nzigzag,\narmchair.\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\nFor all the other (chiral) directions, the amplitude falls\nwithin the above limits.\nThe calculations show that for relatively small A/\u03bb .\n0.2 the dependence P (k) does follow the continuous expression (8) very well. The mutual orientation of the P\nand k constantly evolves as the latter rotates through\nthe angle \u03b8 (Fig. 2). P becomes pure longitudinal along\nthe armchair k\u2212directions and pure transversal along the\nzigzag directions. Along the chiral k-directions, it has\nboth components. Being practically independent of the\ninitial phase \u03c6, the magnitude of polarization P slightly\ndepends on k (within 30%) and reaches its minima along\nthe armchair and maxima along the zigzag directions.\nWe have found \u03b1 and \u03b2 numerically to be \u22120.118e/aB\nand 0.044eaB , respectively. To check that the flexoelectric constant \u03b2 is indeed related to the properties of BN\n\n\f4\nnanotubes, we considered a set of 'ideal' zigzag (n, 0)\nnanotubes cut out of BN sheets in such a way that the\nB and N ions fall on the cylinder with radius R, 2\u03c0R coinciding with the 'wave-length' \u03bb(n, 0). These tubes are\nlongitudinally polarized and their polarization is proportional to 1/R2 to a leading order in 1/R. The coefficient\nof proportionality, as we found from additional calculations, is 0.042eaB , which is very close to the parameter \u03b2\n(0.044eaB ). This means that the curvature-induced polarizations in the corrugated BN sheets and in the BN\nnanotubes indeed have the same origin.\nTo analyze the relationship between electronic structure and P (k), we notice that the WF in a flat BN sheet\nhave roughly the character of the \u03c3- and \u03c0-bond orbitals\n(\u03c3 and \u03c0 WFs). The \u03c0\u2212like WFs are centered exactly\non the N atoms, whereas their \u03c3 counterparts are somewhere in the middle of the B-N bonds closer to the N\natoms (Fig. 3C). The contributions of the \u03c0 and \u03c3 WFs\nto the 'clamped-ion' polarization induced by an in-plane\nuniaxial stretching have the same sign, with the \u03c0 WFs\ndominating and amounting to as much as 85% of the\ntotal (see also Ref. [9]).\nAlthough the corrugation of a flat BN sheet leads to\nthe rehybridization effects like mixing of \u03c0 and \u03c0 \u2217 electronic bands due to breaking the z \u2192 \u2212z mirror symmetry [21], it is still possible to classify all the WFs into\n\u03c0 and \u03c3 types, Figs. 3 and 4. It might naively appear\nthat in the corrugated structures the main contribution\nto P (k) would also come from the \u03c0 WFs. In fact, this\nis not the case. The contribution of \u03c3 WFs generally\nincreases, becoming strongly dominant in some special\ncases in corrugated films.\nConsider first the case of zigzag corrugation with n =\n4, m = \u22124, A/\u03bb = 0.1 and \u03c6 = 0, Fig. 3. Here, the\nshifts of \u03c0 WFs are still dominant but not so apparently\nand |P\u03c0 /P\u03c3 | is only about 2.5. In contrast to the flat\ncase, the \u03c0 and \u03c3 WFs have the opposite sign contributions to P (k) exhibiting inhomogeneous shifts within the\ntwo-dimensional supercell \u03bb \u00d7 T . Upon the corrugation,\nthe \u03c0 WF centers shift relative to the initial positions as\nshown in Fig. 3D. Although the sum of the shifts along\nthe y axis cancels within the supercell, the similar sum\nalong the x axis is nonzero, which means the appearance of a macroscopic transverse polarization, P \u22a5 k.\nInterestingly, the magnitude of the shifts is larger in flatter and more stretched areas, and the shifts themselves\n(along y) are always directed towards more curved and\nless stretched areas. Because of the charge transfer from\nthe flatter to curved regions, the conduction band maximum increases and the valence minimum increases in the\ncurved areas, thus leading to a space modulation of the\nband gap with the wavelength \u03bb.\nNow, we turn our attention to another case, represented by the armchair undulation with n = 4, m = 4,\nA/\u03bb = 0.1, and \u03c6 = 0, Fig. 4. Here again, the \u03c0 and \u03c3\nWFs give the compensating contributions to the polarization. But now, in contrast to the zigzag case, \u03c3 WFs\ndominate by a wide margin: |P\u03c3 /P\u03c0 | \u223c 4.5. All the WFs\n\nshift strictly either along or opposite the k-vector (Fig.\n4C), so that the induced polarization is purely longitudinal. The dominant \u03c3 WFs move towards the N-atoms,\nthus further increasing the polarity of the \u03c3 B-N bonds.\nThe magnitude of the shifts, as in the previous case, is\nlarger in more flattened and stretched areas, but this\nworks only in the second and fourth quarters of the \u03bb. In\nthe first and third quarters, the shifts of \u03c3 WFs are modest even in the well stretched areas. The charge transfer,\ntherefore, increases the energy gap mainly in the second\nand fourth quarters at the expense of the first and third\nquarters of the wavelength.\nTaking a reasonable amplitude-to-wavelength ratio of\nA/\u03bb \u223c 0.2, it is easy to estimate from Eq. (8) that the\ninduced polarization can be on the order of 4\u00d710\u22122 e/aB .\nThis quantity cannot be compared directly to that of 3D\nbulk materials because the latter has different dimension,\ne/a2B . The comparison can be performed, nevertheless,\nif both 2D and 3D polarizations are expressed as the total dipole per stoichiometric unit [9]; then the polarization estimated above becomes 0.8eaB . It is tempting to\ncompare this value with that in the standard perovskite\nPbZrx Ti1\u2212x O3 that has very high efficiency for converting electricity into mechanical strain and vice versa. Taking for the latter an experimental \"bulk\" piezoelectric\nconstant e33 of 11.3 C/m2 [23] and an achievable strain of\n0.2% [24], we obtain only 0.2eaB , four times smaller than\nthe one for BN (!). Hence, the generated polarization in\na BN sheet can be comparable or even higher than that\nin best perovskite ferroelectrics. This situation pretty\nmuch resembles that in the field of electrostrictive materials. Usually, the electrostriction is a small effect, because\nthe induced deformation is only quadratic in electric field\nor polarization. However, dielectrics with large polarization, such as the relaxor ferroelectric Pb(Mg1/3 Nb2/3 )O3 PbTiO3 , are capable of exhibiting the exceptionally large\nelectrostrictive strains.\nThe important characteristic, the voltage drop\nU between opposite sides of the BN strip, can be estimated as (P/\u03c0\u000f\u000f0 ) ln(L/b), where P is the usual 2D\npolarization (in units of C/m), L the separation between\nthe charged strip edge states (strip width), and b the\neffective radius of those states, \u000f0 the dielectric permittivity of vacuum. Taking b to be on the order of the\nlattice parameter a, for reasonable L = (100 \u2212 1000)a,\nand P = 10\u22122 e/aB , we formally obtain U . 5 \u2212 8V for\nBN strip suspended in vacuo and smaller values for the\nstrip on dielectric substrate like SiO2 (\u000f = 3.9), or more\nthan 20 times that of ZnO nanowires [29]. Interestingly,\nin case of suspended BN the band bending qU exceeds the\nvalue of the bandgap Eg = 5.8eV [30], meaning that it\nwill result in a charge transfer between the charged edges\nto make qU \u2248 Eg . This would mean that the achieved\nbias voltage would not depend on the strip width. For\nsmaller bare values of the bias, it depends on L only logarithmically, i.e. very weakly. This insensitivity of the\nproduced bias voltage is extremely attractive for applications. The ability of a BN sheet to effectively convert\n\n\f5\n\nFIG. 3: Wannier functions and their shifts in a corrugated BN sheet corresponding to a zigzag period vector \u03bb(4, \u22124) (\u03b8 = 90\u25e6 ),\nA/\u03bb=0.1, phase \u03c6= 0.

Note that the yellow arrow points along one of the red ones.\n\nwave-like deformations into electricity makes this material very promising for electromechanical applications at\nthe nanoscale (Fig. 5). Below, we present a new concept of a nanogenerator powered by an ambient motion\nor agitation.\nThe direct and efficient conversion of mechanical energy into electricity is of great interest for practical applications. Recently, much attention has been attracted to\nthe possibility of creating miniature nano-generators using semiconducting piezoelectric nanowires such as ZnO,\nGaN, and CdS [26, 27, 28]; during bending they generate\nthe voltage bias between the opposite sidewalls. Unfortunately, such nanowires are not really suitable for this\napplication. First, as has been pointed out in Ref. [29],\nthey lose a significant fraction of their generated charges\nalready in the process of bending due to large internal\nconductivity by virtue of being semiconducting. Second,\nsince the nanowires are grown randomly, only a small\n\nfraction of them (only about 1%) contributes to the generated electric current. And third, in order to generate a\ndc current, the nanowire should slide over a metallic electrodes until the nanowire/electrode interface becomes a\nforward-biased Schottky barrier; this is equivalent to a\nac-dc converter.\nThe nanogenerator based on BN sheets does not suffer\nfrom all of the above shortcomings. First, the BN sheet\nis a dielectric nanostructure with a relatively wide energy\ngap (\u223c 5.8 eV). Second, all the atoms in the sheet are\ninvolved into producing electricity (it is the \"bulk\" effect). Third, the nanogenerator does not need any ac-dc\nconverter, like a diode bridge rectifier, because the generated polarization has a constant direction provided that\nthe direction of the wave vectors k is fixed or, in other\nwords, the ambient wave-like movements are oriented in\nthe space. Fourth, the produced bias voltage is nearly independent from the BN strip width. Moreover, all these\n\n\f6\n\nFIG. 4: Wannier functions and their shifts in a corrugated BN sheet corresponding to a armchair period vector \u03bb(4, 4) (\u03b8 = 0\u25e6 ),\nA/\u03bb=0.1, \u03c6= 0.

The red arrows show the most pronounced shifts in \u03c3 WFs\ninduced by the corrugation (the amplitudes of the shifts are scaled up for clarity). Note that the yellow arrow corresponds to\nthe red one.\n\nadvantages couple with outstanding mechanical properties of a BN sheets, like their ability to be stretched or\nbent by several percent with no atomic defects involved\n[5].\n\nFIG. 5: Schematic showing generation of a bias voltage between the edges of a corrugated BN nanosheet (the geometry\ncorresponds to Fig. 4). Note that the induced polarization is\nlongitudinal, because the corrugation is of the armchair type\n(see text).\n\nIt should be stressed that the corrugation-induced polarization can not be observed in a thin BN film cut out\nof the hexagonal bulk BN material. In such a film, the B\nand N arrangement is reversed in the neighboring hexagonal atomic layers, so that the polarization produced by\neach such pair of layers cancels out. However, the effect\ncan be observed in an ultra-thin BN films with odd number of layers, 1, 3, 5, ... Here, of all the layers only one\nis going to produce the polarization, while the rest can\nbe considered as a mechanically supporting substrate or\nscaffold.\n\n\f7\nIt is worth mentioning that the BN monolayer is not\nthe only 2D system capable of generating electricity under periodic bending. Its isoelectronic analog BC2 N exhibits similar effect in the ground state, like, for example,\nstructure found with the LDA total energy calculations\n[31]. Due to absence of inversion symmetry, BC2 N in this\nstructure is already polarized (electret) in the initial flat\nstate with a polarization of 0.73 \u00d7 10\u22122 e/aB pointing\nalong the armchair-type direction perpendicular to the\npure C-C chains. Moreover, due to in-plane anisotropy\nunder 2\u03c0/3 rotations, the corrugation-induced polarization P (k) is no longer described by the formula (8) and\nits magnitude depends on \u03b8 much stronger than that\nin BN. Nevertheless, there are some k-directions along\nwhich the generation of polarizations is practically as effective as in BN, such directions include the parallel and\nperpendicular ones to the above-mentioned C-C chains.\nHere, we assumed that the edges of BN sheets are\nfixed and, therefore, the surface area of the membrane\nincreases due to its deformation in the third dimension,\nand this increase is simply \u03b5k . It is possible, however,\nto imagine the situation when the edges are not clamped\nand the layer bends in accordion-like fashion without any\nin-plane (average) stretching. In this case, the in-plane\ndeformations \u2202x uy and \u2202y ux would cancel the nonlinear\nterm \u2202x uz \u2202y uz in Eq. (5), and the induced polarization\nwould be defined entirely by the second, 'flexoelectric'\nterm in (8). Such a polarization, however, is relatively\nmodest because the elastic energy associated with the\nout-of-plane bending is noticeably smaller than the elastic stretching energy [22] (this, of course, is already evident from the comparison of the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2).\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n\nR.

Ahn, and J.-M.\n\nWe have studied above the effectively infinite BN\nsheets satisfying the periodic boundary conditions, and\nthe important question is whether the present results apply to the finite 2D BN systems. This question can be\nmotivated by an example of a finite graphene sheet where\nthe presence of zigzag edges induces the localized electronic states at each edge, thus modifying the properties\nof the initial infinite system [32]. Shall we expect the\nsame effect in the case of BN? The answer is no, because,\ncontrary to the carbon counterpart, the BN sheet does\nnot have the conduction and valence bands that touch in\na linear fashion at two inequivalent Dirac points, K and\nK 0 . This degeneracy is always lifted in a 2D BN due to a\nbroken sublattice symmetry, so that the system remains\ninsulating. In the present case the difference between P\nin flat and electroded corrugated states in finite systems\ncan be calculated by using periodic boundary conditions\n[33].\nIn summary, we have found that there is a strong\npolarization-corrugation coupling in a two-dimensional\nstrip cut out of BN sheet, which can be decomposed\ninto the nonlinear 'piezoelecric' and the flexoelectric effects. The direction of the induced polarization strongly\ndepends on the corrugation wave vector k and changes\napproximately as (\u2212 cos 2\u03b8, sin 2\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle\nbetween the zigzag axes and k. The magnitude of the polarization as a total dipole moment per chemical formula\ncan reach very large values comparable to those in the\nbest known perovskite piezoelectrics. The present effect\nmay be used in nanoscale generators activated by ambient vibrations that can power small electronic devices\nand circuits.\n\nTriscone (Springer, Berlin, 2007), pp. 31-68.\n[15] ABINIT code is a common project of the Universite\nCatholique de Louvain, Corning Incorporated, and other\ncontributors (URL http://www.abinit.org).\n[16] S.
