The result is presented in terms of multiple polylogarithms with simple arguments, which allow for analytic continuation in a\nstraightforward manner.\n\n1. Introduction\nSearches for new physics in particle physics rely to a large extend on our\nability to constrain the parameters of the standard model. For instance,\nthe strong coupling constant \u03b1s can be measured by using the data for\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 3-jets. At present, the error on the extraction of \u03b1s from this measurement is dominated by theoretical uncertainties [1], most prominently,\nby the truncation of the perturbative expansion at a fixed order.\nThe perturbative QCD calculation of e+ e\u2212 \u2192 3-jets at next-to-nextto-leading order (NNLO) requires the tree-level amplitudes for e+ e\u2212 \u2192\n5 partons [2], the one-loop amplitudes for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 4 partons [3, 4] as well\nas the two-loop amplitude for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 q q\u0304g together with the one-loop amplitude e+ e\u2212 \u2192 q q\u0304g to order \u03b52 in the parameter of dimensional regularization.\nThe helicity averaged squared matrix elements at the two-loop level for\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 q q\u0304g have recently been given [5]. In contrast, having the two-loop\namplitude available, one keeps the full correlation between the incoming\ne+ e\u2212 and the outgoing parton's spins and momenta. Thus, one can study\noriented event-shape observables. In addition, one has the option to investigate event-shape observables in polarized e+ e\u2212 -annihillation at a future\nlinear e+ e\u2212 -collider TESLA.\n(1)\n\n\f2\n\n2. Calculation\nWe are interested in the following reaction\ne+ + e\u2212 \u2192 q + g + q\u0304 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhich we consider in the form, 0 \u2192 q(p1 ) + g(p2 ) + q\u0304(p3 ) + e\u2212 (p4 ) + e+ (p5 ),\nwith all particles in the final state, to be consistent with earlier work [3].\nThe kinematical invariants for this reaction are denoted by\nsij = (pi + pj )2 , sijk = (pi + pj + pk )2 , s = s123 ,\n\n(2)\n\nand it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless quantities\nx1 =\n\ns12\ns23\n, x2 =\n.\ns123\ns123\n\n(3)\n\nWorking in a helicity basis, it suffices to consider the pure photon exchange amplitude A\u03b3 as it allows the reconstruction of the full amplitude\nwith Z-boson exchange by adjusting the couplings. Furthermore, the complete information about A\u03b3 is given by just one independent helicity amplitude, which we take to be A\u03b3 (1+ , 2+ , 3\u2212 , 4+ , 5\u2212 ). All other helicity configurations can be obtained from parity and charge conjugation.\nWe can write A\u03b3 (1+ , 2+ , 3\u2212 , 4+ , 5\u2212 ) in terms of coefficients c2 , c4 , c6 and\nc12 for the various independent spinor structure as\ni [12]\nA\u03b3 (1+ , 2+ , 3\u2212 , 4+ , 5\u2212 ) = \u221a\n(4)\n2 s3\n\u0015\n\u0013\n\u001a\n\u0014\n\u0012\n2\n\u00d7 sh35i[42] (1 \u2212 x1 ) c2 + c6 \u2212 c12 + (1 \u2212 x2 ) (c4 \u2212 c12 ) + 2c12\nx2\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\u001b\n2\n\u2212h31i[12] [43]h35i c2 + c6 \u2212 c12 + [41]h15i (c4 \u2212 c12 )\n,\nx2\nwhere we have introduced the short-hand notation for spinors of definite\nhelicity, |i\u00b1i = |pi \u00b1i = u\u00b1 (pi ) = v\u2213 (pi ), hi \u00b1 | = hpi \u00b1 | = \u016b\u00b1 (pi ) = v\u0304\u2213 (pi ),\nand for the spinor products hpqi = hp \u2212 |q+i and [pq] = hp + |q\u2212i.\nThe coefficients ci depend on the x1 and x2 of eq.(3) and can be calculated in conventional dimensional regularization. To that end, we proceed\nas follows [6]-[8]. In a first step, with the help of Schwinger parameters [9],\nwe map the tensor integrals to combinations of scalar integrals in various\ndimensions and with various powers \u03bdi of the propagators. For every basic\ntopology, these scalar integrals can be written as nested sums involving \u0393functions. The evaluation of the nested sums proceeds systematically with\n\n\f3\n\nthe help of the algorithms of [6], which rely on the algebraic properties of\nthe so called Z-sums,\nX\n\nZ(n; m1 , ..., mk ; x1 , ..., xk ) =\n\nn\u2265i1 >i2 >...>ik\n\nxikk\nxi11\n.\n.\n.\n.\ni m1\nik mk\n>0 1\n\n(5)\n\nBy means of recursion the algorithms allow to solve the nested sums in\nterms of a given basis in Z-sums to any order in \u03b5. Z-sums can be viewed\nas generalizations of harmonic sums [10] and an important subset of Z-sums\nare multiple polylogarithms [11],\nLimk ,...,m1 (xk , ..., x1 ) = Z(\u221e; m1 , ..., mk ; x1 , ..., xk ).\n\n(6)\n\nAll algorithms for this procedure have been implemented in FORM [12]\nand in the GiNaC framework [13, 14]. In this way, we could calculate all\nloop integrals contributing to the one- and two-loop virtual amplitudes very\nefficiently in terms of multiple polylogarithms.\nThe perturbative expansion in \u03b1s of the functions ci is defined through\nci =\n\n\u221a\n\n4\u03c0\u03b1s\n\n(0)\nci\n\n+\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b1s (1)\nc +\n2\u03c0 i\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b1s\n2\u03c0\n\n\u00132\n\n(2)\nci\n\n3\n\n!\n\n+ O(\u03b1s )\n\n.\n\n(7)\n\nThen, after ultraviolet renormalization, the infrared pole structure of the\nagrees with the prediction made by Catani [15]\nrenormalized coefficients cren\ni\nusing an infrared factorization formula.

As remarked, the infrared poles agree with the structure predicted by Catani [15]. This provides\na strong check of the complete pole structure of our result. In addition, we\nhave tested various relations between the ci . For instance, the combination\nx1 c6 is symmetric under exchange of x1 with x2 . Finally, we could compare with the result for the squared matrix elements, i.e. the interference\nof the two-loop amplitude with the Born amplitude, and the interference of\nthe one-loop amplitude with itself. The results of [5] are given in terms of\none- and two-dimensional harmonic polylogarithms, which form a subset of\nthe multiple polylogarithms [11]. Thus, we have performed the comparision\nanalytically and we agree with the results of [5].\n3. Conclusions\nOur result represents one contribution to the full next-to-next-to-leading\norder calculation of e+ e\u2212 \u2192 3-jets. It has been obtained by means of an\nefficient method based on nested sums and is expressed in terms of multiple polylogarithms with simple arguments. As a consequence, our result\ncan be continued analytically and applies also to (2 + 1)-jet production in\ndeep-inelastic scattering or to the production of a massive vector boson in\n\n\f5\n\nhadron-hadron collisions. At the same time, it provides an important cross\ncheck on the results for the squared matrix elements [5] with a completely\nindependent method.\nAfter the results of section 2 had been presented at this conference,\nGarland et al. published results for the complete two-loop amplitude for\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 q q\u0304g. Our results are in agreement with ref. [17].\nREFERENCES\n[1] G. Dissertori, (2001), hep-ex/0105070.\n[2] F. A. Berends, W. T. Giele, and H. Kuijf, Nucl. Phys. B321, 39 (1989);\nK. Hagiwara and D.
