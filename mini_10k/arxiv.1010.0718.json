This fact is reflected in the longitudinal part of the triangle\ndiagrams. The longitudinal part of triangle anomalies does not depend on the energy scale\ndue to its topological nature: the triangle anomalies calculated in QCD at the level of\nquarks and gluons are reproduced at the level of hadrons (the 't Hooft anomaly matching\ncondition) [4]; this leads to observable consequences for the low-energy physics involving\npions in QCD. A well-known example is the \u03c00 \u2192 2\u03b3 decay. One can ask if the transverse\npart of the triangle graphs is also constrained. If such a constraint exists, it would have\nimplications for the physics of hadron resonances (the \u03c1 and a1 mesons, in particular).\nSuch a question was posed in Ref. [5] and further studied in Refs. [6, 7]. It was found\nthat the transverse part of the current-current correlator in an infinitesimally weak electromagnetic field [denoted as wT (Q2 ) and defined below] is not renormalized in perturbative\nQCD, and so the transverse part is related to the longitudinal part. However, chiral symmetry breaking leads to a violation of this relationship. The nonperturbative aspects of the\ntransverse part have been studied mostly at large Euclidean momentum Q2 = \u2212q 2 . Clearly,\nthe main difficulty is that the transverse part of triangle anomalies has a dynamical nature\nrather than a topological one.\nIn this paper, we study the transverse part of triangle anomalies using the technique of\nholography [8\u201310]. We consider first a class of theories whose gravity dual is described by the\nYang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory with chiral symmetry broken by boundary conditions in\nthe infrared. This class of theories include the early \"bottom-up\" AdS/QCD model inspired\nby dimensional deconstruction and hidden local symmetry [11] and the \"top-down\" Sakai-\n\n\f2\nSugimoto model [12]. (Both models reproduce rather well various aspects of the physics of\nlow-lying hadrons in QCD.) For models in this class, we derive the following relation for the\ntransverse part of triangle anomalies:\nwT (Q2 ) =\n\n\u0003\nNc Nc \u0002\n\u2212 2 \u03a0A (Q2 ) \u2212 \u03a0V (Q2 ) ,\n2\nQ\nf\u03c0\n\n(1)\n\nfor any Q2 . Here wT (Q2 ) is defined in Eq. (3) below, Nc is the number of colors, f\u03c0 is the pion\ndecay constant, and \u03a0A and \u03a0V are the axial and vector current correlators, respectively.\nEquation (1) fully includes the nonperturbative correction and may be regarded as the\n\"anomaly matching for resonances\" as an analogue of that for the massless excitations\nin QCD. As will be shown, Eq. (1) provides a set of sum rules involving the resonance\nparameters, leading to the formulas for the matrix elements of the vector and axial currents\nin the presence of the soft electromagnetic field [see Eqs. (54) and (55)].\nWe also argue that Eq. (1) holds at least approximately in real QCD at both small and\nlarge Q2 .\nII.\n\nTRIANGLE ANOMALIES\n\nFirst we review the triangle anomalies. We consider massless QCD with Nc colors and\nNf flavors. Let us define the correlation function of the vector current j\u03bca = q\u0304\u03b3\u03bc ta q and the\naxial current j\u03bc5b = q\u0304\u03b3\u03bc \u03b35 tb q in a weak electromagnetic background field F\u0302\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc V\u0302\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd V\u0302\u03bc ,\nZ\nab\n5\n(2)\nd hj\u03bc j\u03bd iF\u0302 \u2261 i d4 x eiqx hj\u03bca (x)j\u03bd5b (0)iF\u0302 ,\np\nwhere ta (a = 1, 2, * * * , Nf2 \u2212 1) and t0 = 1/ 2Nf are the U(Nf ) flavor matrices normalized\nso that tr(ta tb ) = \u03b4 ab /2. We also define dab = (1/2) tr(Q{ta , tb }) where Q is the electric\ncharge matrix. Since hj\u03bc j\u03bd5 iF\u0302 is a Lorentz pseudo-tensor, the leading term in its expansion\nover the weak background field F\u0302\u03bc\u03bd is a linear combination of three structures: F\u0303\u03bc\u03bd , q\u03bc q \u03c3 F\u0303\u03c3\u03bd ,\nand q\u03bd q \u03c3 F\u0303\u03c3\u03bc with F\u0303\u03bc\u03bd = (1/2)\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 F\u0302 \u03b1\u03b2 . Imposing vector current conservation q \u03bc hj\u03bc j\u03bd5 iF\u0302 = 0,\nthe number of independent structures reduces to two: the longitudinal and transverse parts\nwith respect to q \u03bd . The general expression up to the leading order in F\u0303 is\ni\n1 h\nhj\u03bc j\u03bd5 iF\u0302 = \u2212 2 wT (q 2 )(\u2212q 2 F\u0303\u03bc\u03bd + q\u03bc q \u03c3 F\u0303\u03c3\u03bd \u2212 q\u03bd q \u03c3 F\u0303\u03c3\u03bc ) + wL (q 2 )q\u03bd q \u03c3 F\u0303\u03c3\u03bc ,\n(3)\n4\u03c0\nwhere we follow the notation of [5]. The longitudinal and transverse nature of the terms in\nthis expression can be manifestly shown by using the transverse and longitudinal projection\n\u03b1k\ntensors, P\u03bc\u03b1\u22a5 = \u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 \u2212 q\u03bc q \u03b1 /q 2 and P\u03bc = q\u03bc q \u03b1 /q 2 :\nhj\u03bc j\u03bd5 iF\u0302 =\nwhere Q2 = \u2212q 2 .\n\n\u0003\nQ2 \u03b1\u22a5 \u0002 \u03b2\u22a5\n2\n\u03b2k\n2\nP\nP\nw\n(q\n)\n+\nP\nw\n(q\n)\nF\u0303\u03b1\u03b2 ,\nT\nL\n\u03bc\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\n4\u03c0 2\n\n(4)\n\n\f3\nThe result for wL is well-known [1, 2]:\nwL (Q2 ) =\n\n2Nc\n.\nQ2\n\n(5)\n\nThis quantity does not receive corrections [3]. At the level of hadrons, the 1/Q2 singularity\nin Eq. (5) is accounted for by the massless pion.\nOn the other hand, the result for wT is known perturbatively [5],\nwTpert (Q2 ) =\n\nNc\n.\nQ2\n\n(6)\n\nThis quantity does not receive perturbative corrections as first shown by Vainshtein [5] but\nit receives nonperturbative corrections [6, 7]. In the next section, we will show that the\nnonperturbative corrections are given in Eq. (1) for any Q2 in the class of holographic QCD\nmodels mentioned above.\nIII.\n\nHOLOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION\nA.\n\nSetup\n\nThe five-dimensional (5D) action of the holographic dual of our theory consists of a\nYang-Mills (YM) and a Chern-Simons (CS) terms with a U(Nf ) gauge group,\nS = SYM + SCS\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\n1\n5\n2\n2\n2\nSYM = \u2212 d x tr \u2212f (z)Fz\u03bc + 2 F\u03bc\u03bd ,\n2g (z)\n\u0015\nZ \u0014\n1 5\ni 3\n2\nSCS = \u03ba tr AF \u2212 A F \u2212 A .\n2\n10\n\n(7)\n(8)\n(9)\n\nHere and below, z is the fifth coordinate which runs from \u2212z0 to z0 (z0 > 0); the Greek\nindices \u03bc, \u03bd, * * * denote the 4D boundary coordinates and the Latin indices M, N, * * * denote\nthe bulk 5D coordinates. A(x, z) = AM dxM is the 5D U(Nf ) gauge field and F = dA+iA\u2227A\nis the field strength. They are decomposed as A = Aa ta and F = F a ta .\nThe functions f (z) and g(z) with the conditions f (\u2212z) = f (z) and g(\u2212z) = g(z) (required\nby parity) are related to the metric of the bulk. For example, in the \"cosh\" model considered\nin [11], f (z) \u223c cosh(z) and g(z) = const with z0 = \u221e, and in the Sakai-Sugimoto model [12],\nf (z) \u223c (1 + z 2 )1/2 and g(z) \u223c (1 + z 2 )1/6 with z0 = \u221e. In order to keep discussion general,\nwe will leave f (z) and g(z) unspecified; our results below will be valid for any choice of f (z)\nRz\nand g(z) [provided that \u2212z0 0 dz f \u22122 (z) is convergent, see Eq. (23)]. On the other hand, \u03ba will\nbe fixed as \u03ba = Nc /(24\u03c0 2 ) to reproduce the correct anomaly in QCD [see Eq. (29)]. In the\ntop-down approach, the CS term with \u03ba = Nc /(24\u03c0 2 ) is obtained from the effective action\nof the probe D8-branes [12].\n\n\f4\nAs shown in Ref. [11], this theory can be interpreted as a theory of mesons, which\nincludes infinite towers of vector mesons and axial-vector mesons, and one massless pion.\nWe decompose the gauge field A(x, z) into a parity-even part V (x, z) and a parity-odd part\nA(x, z),\nA(x, z) = V (x, z) + A(x, z),\nV (\u2212z) = V (z),\n\nA(\u2212z) = \u2212A(z),\n\n(10)\n\nwhich correspond to vector and axial-vector modes, respectively. Then boundary conditions\nare imposed at z = 0 (which we call the IR brane): V \u2032 (0) = 0 and A(0) = 0, where\nthe derivative is taken with respect to z. Chiral symmetry is broken due to the different\nboundary conditions of V and A. The boundary conditions at z = \u00b1z0 (the UV branes) are\nthe external gauge fields,\nA(z0 ) = AL \u2261 V + A,\n\nA(\u2212z0 ) = AR \u2261 V \u2212 A.\n\n(11)\n\nLet us first recall the computation of two-point functions of currents in the absence of\nthe external field F\u0302 . For this purpose, the nonlinear CS term in the action can be dropped.\nWe will work in the Az (x, z) = 0 gauge. The field A\u03bc satisfies a linear differential equation,\nwhich is easiest to solve in terms of the Fourier components A(x, z). The solution depends\na\nlinearly on the boundary conditions, V\u03bc0\nand Aa\u03bc0 , through the mode functions V (q, z),\nA(q, z), and \u03c8(z),\na\na\nAa\u03bc (q, z) = V (q, z)P\u03bc\u03b1\u22a5 V\u03b10\n(q) + A(q, z)P\u03bc\u03b1\u22a5 Aa\u03b10 (q) + P\u03bc\u03b1k V\u03b10\n(q) \u2212 \u03c8(z)P\u03bc\u03b1k Aa\u03b10 (q)\n\n(12)\n\n(as will be seen later, the mode function for the longitudinal part of V is simply 1). The\nmode functions satisfy the boundary conditions\nV (q, \u00b1z0 ) = 1,\n\nA(q, z0 ) = \u2212A(q, \u2212z0 ) = 1,\n\n\u03c8(z0 ) = \u2212\u03c8(\u2212z0 ) = 1.\n\n(13)\n\nThe linearized field equations are given by\n\u0002\n\u0003\nQ2\n\u2202z f 2 (z)\u2202z V (Q, z) \u2212 2 V (Q, z) = 0,\ng (z)\n\u0002\n\u0003\nQ2\n\u2202z f 2 (z)\u2202z A(Q, z) \u2212 2 A(Q, z) = 0,\ng (z)\n\u0002 2\n\u0003\n\u2202z f (z)\u2202z \u03c8(z) = 0,\n\n(14)\n(15)\n(16)\n\nwhere Q2 = \u2212q 2 . We note that V and A are two linearly independent solutions to the same\ndifferential equation, so their Wronskian should be independent of z:\nf 2 (z)[V (Q, z)A\u2032 (Q, z) \u2212 A(Q, z)V \u2032 (Q, z)] = W (Q).\nOn the other hand, Eq.

(16), but with the\nboundary value of 1 at both \u00b1z0 . This function is identically 1.\nUsing the field equations, one can perform integration in the action by parts and the\nintegral reduces to the boundary values at z = \u00b1z0 :\nZ 4\nz=+z0\n1\ndq 2\na\n\u03bca\n.\n(19)\nSYM =\nf (z)A\u03bc (q, z)\u2202z A (q, z)\n2 (2\u03c0)4\nz=\u2212z0\na\nDifferentiating the action twice with respect to the boundary value V\u03bc0\n, one finds the vector\ncurrent correlation function,\nZ\n\u22a5\ni d4 x eiqx hj\u03bca (x)j\u03bdb (0)i = \u03b4 ab Q2 P\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03a0V (Q2 ),\n(20)\n\n1\n\u03a0V (Q ) = 2 f 2 (z)V (Q, z)V \u2032 (Q, z)\nQ\n\nz=+z0\n\n2\n\nz=\u2212z0\n\n2\n= 2 f 2 (z)V \u2032 (Q, z)\nQ\n\nz=z0\n\n,\n\n(21)\n\nand similarly for \u03a0A . Especially, the pion decay constant f\u03c0 can be obtained from the\nlongitudinal part of the axial current correlation function,\nf\u03c02 = f 2 (z)\u03c8(z)\u03c8 \u2032 (z)\n\nz=+z0\nz=\u2212z0\n\n= 2C\u03c0 ,\n\n(22)\n\nor equivalently,\n4\n=\nf\u03c02\n\nZ\n\nz0\n\ndz\n.\n2\n\u2212z0 f (z)\n\n(23)\n\nThis expression is consistent with the one obtained in [11] as it should be. We assume that\nthe right hand side of Eq. (23) is convergent so that f\u03c0 is finite.\nB.\n\nLongitudinal and transverse triangle anomalies\n\nWe then take into account the effect of the CS term induced by the weak background\nfield F\u0302\u03bc\u03bd . We will work in the limit of weak background field F\u0302 , and expand to linear order\nin F\u0302 . For the computation of wL and wT , we can neglect the nonlinear terms in the YM\naction, because they do not include V V A interactions accompanied with \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 tensor.\nFirst we note that we do not have to find the correction to the classical solution that comes\nfrom the CS action. Indeed, our old solution (to the Maxwell equation) is an extremum of\nthe classical action, and hence a small change in the solution does not change the YM action\nto linear order. All we have to do is to substitute our old solution into the CS action.\nWe then note that, unlike the YM action, the CS action is not gauge-invariant (up to\nboundaries). In order for Az = 0, we carry out the gauge transformation\nAM \u2192 AM \u2212 \u2202M \u039b,\nZ z\nf\u03c0\n\u039b=\ndz 2 \u03c0(x).\n2f (z)\n0\n\n(24)\n(25)\n\n\f6\nThis keeps the transverse part of AM unchanged, but changes the longitudinal part as\nk\n\u2202\u03bc Az \u2192 \u2212\u2202z A\u03bc . The contributions to wL and wT come from the first term in Eq.

(21), one obtains\n\u03a0A \u2212 \u03a0V =\n\n2\nW (Q).\nQ2\n\n(32)\n\nCombining Eqs (31) and (32), one finally arrives at the relation\nwT (Q2 ) =\n\n\u0003\nNc Nc \u0002\n2\n2\n\u03a0\n(Q\n)\n\u2212\n\u03a0\n(Q\n)\n,\n\u2212\nA\nV\nQ2\nf\u03c02\n\n(33)\n\nfor any Q2 . It is clear from our derivation that this relation holds independently of f (z)\nand g(z) (i.e., the metric of the gravity). This relation for wT , which leads to the strong\n1\n\nThe expression for wL is similar to the one obtained in [13], but is different by the boundary value.\n\n\f7\nconstraints between the resonance parameters, as we will show below, may be called the\n\"anomaly matching for resonances\" as an analogue of wL .\nUsing the both relations for wL and wT , one also has2\nhj\u03bcL j\u03bdR iF\u0302 = \u2212\n\nNc Q2\n\u03a0LR (Q2 )P\u03bc\u03b1\u22a5 P\u03bd\u03b2\u22a5 F\u0303\u03b1\u03b2 ,\n2\u03c0 2 f\u03c02\n\n(34)\n\nfor arbitrary Q2 , where j\u03bcLa = q\u0304L \u03b3\u03bc ta qL is the left-handed current and j\u03bcRa = q\u0304R \u03b3\u03bc ta qR is the\nright-handed current. The form of this expression except the proportionality coefficient is\nfixed solely by the chiral symmetry SU(Nf )L \u00d7 SU(Nf )R ; what we obtained here is the exact\ncoefficient \u2212Nc Q2 /(2\u03c0 2 f\u03c02 ) including the Q2 -dependence.\nC.\n\nSum rules for resonances\n\nWe shall consider the implications of the relation (33) in terms of resonances (\u03c1 meson,\na1 meson, and so on). In the large Nc limit, a tower of resonances with the decay widths\n\u0393 \u223c 1/Nc are well defined. We denote the i-th vector meson as Vi (i = 1, 2, * * * ) and j-th\naxial-vector meson as Aj (j = 1, 2, * * * ). The wave functions for Vi and Aj in the fifth\ndimension bVi ,Aj (z) and their masses mVi ,Aj can be determined by decomposing Eqs.

Substituting\nthe mode expansions (37) and (38) into Eqs.

(54) and (55) are the new formulas involving resonances.\nRemarkably, for fixed isospins a and b, the transverse parts of the matrix elements (54) and\n(55) are respectively proportional to the decay constants gVi and gAj with the universal proportionality coefficient independent of species i and j (apart from the transverse projection).\nFor example, for Nf = 2, one has\nk\n\nNc\nF\u0303\u03bc\u03bd h0|j \u03bd5a |\u03c0 a i,\n8\u03c0 2 f\u03c02\nNc\n= tr[Q]\nF\u0303\u03bc\u03bd h0|j \u03bd5a |Aaj i,\n16\u03c0 2 f\u03c02\nNc\n= tr[Q]\nF\u0303\u03bc\u03bd h0|j \u03bda|Via i,\n16\u03c0 2 f\u03c02\n\nh0|j\u03bca|\u03c0 a iF\u0303 = tr[Q]\nh0|j\u03bca |Aaj i\u22a5\nF\u0303\nh0|j\u03bc5a |Via i\u22a5\nF\u0303\n\n(56)\n(j = 1, 2, * * * ),\n(i = 1, 2, * * * ),\n\n(57)\n(58)\n\nwhere no summation is taken over a. We note here that the universality of the proportionality\ncoefficient originates from the constant value \u2212Nc /f\u03c02 with no Q2 -dependence in front of the\nbracket in Eq. (33).\nThe above sum rules and resultant matrix elements are generic to any theory with a\nYang-Mills-Chern-Simons gravity dual in the large Nc limit. As an example, we explicitly\ncheck the sum rules using the \"cosh\" model [11] in Appendix A. However, they will not\nbe generally valid in a theory incorporating the scalar field corresponding to the chiral\ncondensate [14\u201316] (although we have a different type of sum rules which may be irrelevant\nto real QCD). We provide this counterexample in Appendix B. In the next section, we will\ndiscuss that real QCD behaves similarly to the former class of theories with the universality\nrather than to the latter counterexample.\nIf one assumes that sum rules (51) and (52) are saturated by the lowest resonances\ni = j = 1, one has\ngV1 = gA1 ,\nNc\ng\u03b3V1 A1 = \u2212 2 2 (m2A1 \u2212 m2V1 ).\n4\u03c0 f\u03c0\n\n(59)\n(60)\n\nEquation (59) is equivalent to the second Weinberg sum rule gV21 \u2212 gA2 1 = 0 [17], whereas\nEq.

Taking experimental values for these parameters, we find\ng\u03b3\u03c1f1 \u2248 \u22129.2 (and g\u03b3\u03c1a \u2248 \u22128.0) for Nc = 3.5 This is not far from the value |g\u03b3\u03c1f1 | = 7.6 \u00b1 1.1\ndetermined from the experimentally measured decay rate \u0393exp (f1 \u2192 \u03c10 + \u03b3) = 1.34 \u00b1 0.38\nMeV [19] by using the formula [20]:\n\u0393(f1 \u2192 \u03c10 + \u03b3) =\n\n2\n(m2f1 + m2\u03c1 )(m2f1 \u2212 m2\u03c1 )3\n\u03b1d230 g\u03b3\u03c1f\n1\n,\n24\nm2\u03c1 m5f1\n\n(61)\n\nwhere d30 = 1/4 for Q = diag(2/3, \u22121/3).\n5\n\nA numerical evaluation of (46) using the specific metric of the Sakai-Sugimoto model gives g\u03b3\u03c1f1 = \u22123.8\n[18] (after matching notation to ours), which is rather smaller than our prediction using the truncated\nsum rules.\n\n\f11\n\nFIG. 2: Diagrams contributing to hj\u03bc j\u03bd5 inonpert . The solid and spiral lines denote quarks and gluons\nF\u0302\n\nrespectively.\n\nIV.\n\nREAL QCD\n\nLet us discuss whether the relation (33) is realized in real QCD. This is easy to check for\nQ \u226a \u039b2QCD where the dynamics is governed by the low-lying pions. Because pions do not\ncontribute to wT , the left hand side of (33) should vanish at small Q2 . In the right hand\nside, pions only contribute to the axial correlator \u03a0A \u2243 f\u03c02 /Q2 ; the singularities of 1/Q2\ncancel in total, and hence, Eq. (33) is valid.\nIn the opposite regime, Q2 \u226b \u039b2QCD , one can make use of the operator product expansion\n(OPE) analysis, which is an expansion of the correlator in terms of \u039b2QCD /Q2 . As usually\nadopted in the practical applications of the QCD sum rules [21], we shall neglect the \u03b1s corrections and the anomalous dimensions of local composite operators in the OPE. Although\nthese simplifications (called the practical OPE) are numerically good [22], our discussion\nbelow is approximate at this level.\nFor convenience, look at the relation (34) instead of (33).

Our relation provides a set of sum\nrules involving the masses, decay constants and couplings between resonances, and leads to\nthe formulas for the matrix elements of the vector and axial currents in the presence of the\nsoft electromagnetic field. These results are generic to any theory with a Yang-Mills-ChernSimons gravity dual where chiral symmetry is broken by the boundary conditions.\nIn real QCD, our relation is also valid at least approximately when the magnetic susceptibility of the chiral condensate takes a special value \u03c7 = \u2212Nc /(4\u03c0 2f\u03c02 ). The uncertainty of\nour relation in real QCD should be resolved in the future. This is relevant to the theoretical estimate of the hadronic electroweak contribution concerning \u03b3\u03b3 \u2217 Z triangle diagrams to\nthe muon anomalous magnetic moment, which can be experimentally determined to high\nprecision [26, 27].\nThere are several open questions. Among others, it is desirable to understand our relation\nand resulting formulas for the matrix elements in the field theoretical point of view. One\n\n\f13\ncan also consider its generalization to nonzero temperature and/or nonzero baryon chemical\npotential. In relation to heavy ion physics, this may lead to some possible effects on the\n\"chiral magnetic effect\" [28, 29] considered to explain the fluctuations of charge asymmetry\nin noncentral collisions.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors thank M.

The result for wL is consistent with the anomaly matching\ncondition (5).7\nNow we are ready to check the validity of the relation (33) in this theory. Let us first\nconsider small Q2 . Using V (0, z) = 1, one can easily check that \u03a0V and wT vanish while\n\u03a0A (Q2 ) \u2192 f\u03c02 /Q2 ; thus the relation (33) is valid.\nOn the other hand, for large Q2 , we can expand V\u22a5 and A\u22a5 near the boundary,\n1\nV\u22a5 (Q, z) = 1 + (Qz)2 ln(Q2 z 2 ) + . . . ,\n4\n1\n4\ng 2\u03c3 2\nA\u22a5 (Q, z) = 1 + (Qz)2 ln(Q2 z 2 ) \u2212 (Qz)2 5 6 + . . . ,\n4\n5\nQ\n\n(B21)\n(B22)\n\nwhich lead to (up to contact terms):\n1\nln Q2 ,\n2g52\n8 \u03c32\n1\n,\n\u03a0A (Q2 ) = \u2212 2 ln Q2 +\n2g5\n5 Q6\nNc 32Nc g52 \u03c3 2\nwT (Q2 ) = 2 \u2212\n,\nQ\n5 Q8\n\n\u03a0V (Q2 ) = \u2212\n\n(B23)\n(B24)\n(B25)\n\nwhere the integral\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ndx x2 K1 (x) = 2,\n\n(B26)\n\n0\n\nis used for evaluating wT .

One may improve this point by adding a surface term at the IR brane [25].\n\n\f18\nfor large Q2 . Clearly, the nonperturbative correction is different from Eq. (33) and from the\nbehavior in real QCD shown in Sec. IV: the coefficient in front of the bracket is Q2 -dependent\nbut not a constant \u2212Nc /f\u03c02 . This difference originates from the OPE of wT in Eq. (B25)\nwhere the nonperturbative correction is proportional to 1/Q8 rather than 1/(f\u03c02Q6 ). This\nwill be due the absence of the field corresponding to the operator q\u0304\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd q in this theory which\nis essential for the relation (33) to be realized in real QCD at large Q2 . One may improve\nthis point by adding the tensor field H\u03bc\u03bd corresponding to the operator q\u0304\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd q in the theory,\nalthough it would still require a fine-tuning of parameters to reproduce the quantitatively\ncorrect OPE in QCD.\nIn this case, one can still derive a set of transverse sum rules [but different type from\nEqs. (51) and (52)] for highly excited resonances using Eq. (B29). Since pions do not\ncontribute to wT , we have only to consider the contributions from the vector and axialvector mesons for wT . Similarly to Eq.

(54) and (55). This again comes from the 1/Q2 behavior in front of the bracket in\nEq. (B29), and is different from real QCD where this factor should be approximately replaced\nby a constant value. Therefore, we expect that real QCD would have the properties (54)\nand (55) rather than (B32) and (B33).\nAppendix C: Magnetic susceptibility of the chiral condensate\n\nIn this appendix, we review the derivation of the magnetic susceptibility of the chiral\ncondensate by Vainshtein [5].
