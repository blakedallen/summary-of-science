Introduction\nUsing modular techniques inspired by the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, it was finally\nshown in [10] that the only perfect powers in the Fibonnaci sequence are 1, 8 and 144.\nFibonnaci is just one example of an infinte sequence (hm ) of integers\n. . . , h\u22122 , h\u22121 , h0 , h1 , h2 , . . .\nsatisfying hm |hn whenever m|n and, up to sign,\n\nhm+n hm\u2212n = hm+1 hm\u22121 h2n \u2212 hn+1 hn\u22121 h2m\n\nfor all m, n \u2208 Z, where h2 h3 , 0. Gezer and Bizim [27] have recently described the squares\nin some of these sequences but (hm ) was first studied in general by Ward [49] and is related\nto a Weierstrass equation\n(1.1)\n\ny2 + a1 xy + a3 y = x3 + a2 x2 + a4 x + a6\n\nwith integer coefficients. See [43, 44] for background on Weierstrass equations and elliptic\ncurves. The non-singular rational points on (1.1) form a group Ens (Q) and for P \u2208 Ens (Q)\ndifferent from the identity we can write\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec AP C P \uf8f7\uf8f7\n(1.2)\n(x(P), y(P)) = \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed 2 , 3 \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 ,\nBP BP\n\nwhere AP , BP , C P \u2208 Z and gcd(AP C P , BP ) = 1. Let (hm ) be a sequence of integers as above\nwith h0 = 0 and h1 = 1. Building on work of Ward, Shipsey [39] has given a formula\nfor a Weierstrass equation (1.1) such that hm = \u03c8m (0, 0), where \u03c8m is the mth division\npolynomial (see Section 3.2) and hm = \u00b1Bm(0,0) if gcd(a3 , a4 ) = 1. For example, up to sign,\n(0, 0) on\ny2 + xy + y = x3 \u2212 2x2\ngenerates the Fibonacci sequence (Bm(0,0) ). In [49] Ward calls (hm ) an elliptic divisibility\nsequence; however, as in the Fibonacci case, the Weierstrass equation for (hm ) may have a\nDate: November 7, 2018.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 11G05, 11D41.\nThe author is supported by a Marie Curie Intra European Fellowship (PIEF-GA-2009-235210).\nThe author thanks Gunther Cornelissen, Sander Dahmen and Shaun Stevens for helpful comments.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nJONATHAN REYNOLDS\n\nsingular point and so not define an elliptic curve. Via the work of Everest [21, 23], Ingram\n[29], Silverman [31, 41] et al, it has now become conventional to use the following\nDefinition 1.1. Let E/Q be an elliptic curve and (1.1) a Weierstrass equation for E. Let\nP \u2208 E(Q) be a non-torsion point. For m \u2208 N denote BmP , as in (1.2), by Bm . The sequence\n(Bm) is an elliptic divisibility sequence.\nIn the current paper, we are interested in analogues for elliptic divisibility sequences (in\nthe sense of Definition 1.1) to the result for Fibonacci numbers. There are certainly perfect\npowers in some elliptic divisibility sequences. For example,\nE : y2 + xy = x3 + x2 \u2212 7x + 5\n\nwith P = (2, \u22123) gives Bm = 1 for m = 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and B12 = 27 . However, the following\ntheorem shows that one can often prove that there are only finitely many perfect powers in\nsuch sequences.\nTheorem 1.2. Let (Bm ) be an elliptic divisibility sequence whose first term is divisible by 2\nor 3. There are finitely many perfect powers in (Bm ). Moreover, if Bm = zl for some integer\nz and prime l then l can be bounded explicitly in terms of E and P.\nThe proof of Theorem 1.2 combines a recent Frey-Hellegouarch construction for Klein\nforms by Bennett and Dahmen [3] with a primitive divisor result due to Silverman [41].\nThe method of proof is so flexible that it also allows one in certain concrete cases to completely determine the set of all perfect power terms, as was done for the Fibonacci sequence\n(see Proposition 1.5 and Example 1.9 below). The condition that only 2 or 3 divides the\nfirst term is because higher primes, such as 5, do not give a Klein form as in Defintion 3.7.\nLet E/Q be an elliptic curve and (1.1) a Weierstrass equation for E. Siegel [40] proved\nthat there are finitely many P \u2208 E(Q) with BP = 1. In [24] it is shown that for fixed l > 1,\nthere are finitely many P \u2208 E(Q) with BP = zl for some z \u2208 Z. Since their denominator is\na perfect power, perhaps it is reasonable to give the following\nDefinition 1.3. Call P \u2208 E(Q) power integral if BP (as in (1.2)) is equal to a perfect power.\nNote that 1 is a perfect power and so power integral points can be thought of as a\ngeneralization of the integral points. A lot of work has been done to make Siegel's theorem\neffective [2, 11, 25, 28, 34] and there are many techniques which can find all of the integral\npoints for large classes of elliptic curves [26, 35, 46, 47]. For certain curves we are now\nable to find all of the power integral points.\n1.1. Mordell curves. Theorem 1.2 can be strengthened considerably for Mordell curves.\nTheorem 1.4. Let D \u2208 Z be non-zero and E : y2 = x3 + D. There are finitely many perfect\npowers in an elliptic divisibility sequence (Bm) whose first term is greater than 1. As in\nTheorem 1.2, there is a bound depending on D and P for the possible prime exponents.\nBy utilizing the proofs of the theorems above in a specific case we are able to find the\nMordell curve of smallest conductor with non-zero rank and no power integral points.\nProposition 1.5. The elliptic curve E : y2 = x3 + 11 has no power integral points.\nIn the general case, allowing for integral points, we expect the following to hold.\nConjecture 1.6. Let D \u2208 Z be non-zero and E : y2 = x3 + D. For l a sufficiently large\nprime, if BP (as in (1.2)) is an lth power then BP = 1.\nAt the end of Section 5 it is explained that Conjecture 1.6 would follow from the FreyMazur conjecture [16].\n\n\fPERFECT POWERS IN ELLIPTIC DIVISIBILITY SEQUENCES\n\n3\n\n1.2. Congruent number curves. A much studied class of elliptic curves is the congruent\nnumber curves E N : y2 = x3 \u2212 N 2 x, where N \u2265 1 is an integer. Let p be an odd prime and\na, b non-negative integers. For N = 2a pb , a simple algorithm for the determination of the\nintegral points in E N (Q) has been given in [19] and [20]. In this case we are able to find all\npower integral points in 2E N (Q); in fact they are all integral.\nTheorem 1.7. Let N = 2a pb . If P \u2208 2E N (Q) is power integral then N = 2a 3b and\nP = (c2 25, c3 35), where a, b are odd, a \u2265 3 and c = \u00b12(a\u22123)/2 3(b\u22121)/2 .\nIn Section 6 Theorem 1.7 is proven using Fermat's Last Theorem, due to Wiles [50],\nalong with the first variants by Ribet [38], Darmon and Merel [17].\nTheorem 1.8. Let N = 2a p, where a = 0 or 1. Suppose that P \u2208 E N (Q) has\nx(P) \u2208 \u2212Q\u22172\n\nand\nx(P) + N \u2208 pQ\u22172 .\n\nThen there are no perfect powers in the elliptic divisibility sequence generated by P.\nTheorem 1.8 is proven using Theorem 1.7 along with an equation recently solved by\nBennett, Ellenberg and Ng [4].\nExample 1.9. There are no perfect powers in the elliptic divisibility sequence generated\nby (\u2212(60/41)2, \u2212455700/413) on E5 : y2 = x3 \u2212 25x.\nLet N = 2a p, where a = 0 or 1. Points belonging to two cosets in E N (Q)/2E N (Q) have\nbeen considered above. The remaining cases lead to equations which currently appear unresolvable in general. As the next example shows, there can be power integral points on E N\nwhich are not integral. However, in the example N is equal to the odd terms of a sequence\n(Cm ) and, since these odd terms form an elliptic divisibility sequence, there are conjectured to be finitely many possibilities with N prime [22]. This, along with Theorem 1.7\nand Theorem 1.8, suggests that the number of power integral points in E N (Q) which are\nnot integral could be uniformly bounded.\nExample 1.10. For (\u22121, 1) on y2 = x3 \u2212 2x and m odd write\n!\nA2m AmCm\n.\nm(\u22121, 1) = \u2212 2 ,\nBm B3m\nWe get a power integral point on ECm : y2 = x3 \u2212 Cm2 x given by x(P) = \u2212(Cm Am )2 /B4m .\nMoreover, Cm is prime for m = 3, 7 and 23.\n2. Properties of elliptic divisibility sequences\nIn this section the required properties of elliptic divisibility sequences are collected.\nLemma 2.1. Let (Bm ) be an elliptic divisibility sequence.\n(i) Let p be a prime and m0 be the smallest positive integer such that p | Bm0 . Then for\nevery m \u2208 N,\np | Bm \u21d0\u21d2 m0 | m.\n(ii) Let p be an odd prime. For any pair n, m \u2208 N, if ord p (Bn) > 0 then\nord p (Bmn ) = ord p (Bn) + ordp (m).\n\n\f4\n\nJONATHAN REYNOLDS\n\n(iii) For any pair n, m \u2208 N, if 2 | Bn then\n\nord2 (Bmn) = ord2 (Bn ) + ord2 (m)\n\nif a1 is even and\n|ord2 (Bmn) \u2212 (ord2 (Bn ) + ord2 (m))| \u2264 \u01eb\n\notherwise, where the constant \u01eb depends only on E and P.\n(iv) For all m, n \u2208 N,\ngcd(Bm , Bn) = Bgcd(m,n) .\nProof. See [41] and Section 4 in Chapter IV of [45].\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 2.2. Given a prime p, a rational point on (1.1) can be reduced modulo p to give a\npoint defined over a finite field (see Chapter VII of [43]). It follows that m0 in Lemma 2.1\nexists for every prime at which the generator of the elliptic divisibility sequence has nonsingular reduction.\nLemma 2.3. Assume that the given Weierstrass equation for E has a1 even. For a prime p\nsuppose that m0 = p in Lemma 2.1. Write m = pe m\u2032 where p \u2224 m\u2032 . If Bm is an lth power\nthen so is Bm\u2032 . Moreover, p \u2224 Bm\u2032 .\nProof. By Lemma 2.1, if a prime q divides Bm\u2032 then q , p and\nordq (Bm ) = ordq (Bm\u2032 ) + ordq (pe ) = ordq (Bm\u2032 )\nso the result follows.\n\n\u0003\n\nDefinition 2.4. A prime p|Bm such that p \u2224 Bm\u2032 for any m\u2032 < m is called a primitive divisor.\nTheorem 2.5 (Silverman). For all but finitely many m \u2208 N, Bm has a primitive divisor.\nMoreover, if Bm does not have a primitive divisor then m is bounded by an effectively\ncomputable constant which depends only on E and P.\nProof. See [41] or Chapter IV of [45].\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 2.6. For certain minimal Weierstrass equations the number of terms without a\nprimitive divisor has been uniformly bounded (see [29, 30, 31]).\n3. The modular approach to Diophantine equations\nFor a more thorough exploration see [15] and Chapter 15 in [13]. As is conventional, in\nwhat follows all newforms shall have weight 2 with a trivial character at some level N and\nshall be thought of as a q-expansion\nX\nf =q+\ncn q n ,\nn\u22652\n\nwhere the field K f = Q(c2 , c3 , * * * ) is a totally real number field. The coefficients cn are\nalgebraic integers and f is called rational if they all belong to Z. For a given level N,\nthe number of newforms is finite. The modular symbols algorithm [14], implemented on\nMAGMA [8] by William Stein, shall be used to compute the newforms at a given level.\nTheorem 3.1 (Modularity Theorem). Let E/Q be an elliptic curve of conductor N. Then\nthere exists a newform f of level N such that a p (E) = c p for all primes p \u2224 N, where c p is\npth coefficient of f and a p (E) = p + 1 \u2212 #E(F p ).\nProof. This is due to Taylor and Wiles [48, 50] in the semi-stable case. The proof was\ncompleted by Breuil, Conrad, Diamond and Taylor [9].\n\u0003\n\n\fPERFECT POWERS IN ELLIPTIC DIVISIBILITY SEQUENCES\n\n5\n\nThe modularity of elliptic curves over Q can be seen as a converse to\nTheorem 3.2 (Eichler-Shimura). Let f be a rational newform of level N. There exists an\nelliptic curve E/Q of conductor N such that a p (E) = c p for all primes p \u2224 N, where c p is\nthe pth coefficient of f and a p (E) = p + 1 \u2212 #E(F p ).\nProof. See Chapter 8 of [18].\n\n\u0003\n\nGiven a rational newform of level N, the elliptic curves of conductor N associated to it\nvia the Eichler-Shimura theorem shall be computed using MAGMA.\nProposition 3.3. Let E/Q be an elliptic curve with conductor N and minimal discriminant\n\u2206min . Let l be an odd prime and define\nY\np.\nN0 (E, l) := N/\nprimes p||N\nl|ord p (\u2206min )\n\nSuppose that the Galois representation\n\u03c1lE : Gal(Q\u0304/Q) \u2192 Aut(E[l])\nis irreducible. Then there exists a newform f of level N0 (E, l). Also there exists a prime L\nlying above l in the ring of integers O f defined by the coefficients of f such that\n(\na p (E) mod L\nif p \u2224 lN,\ncp \u2261\n\u00b1(1 + p) mod L if p || N and p \u2224 lN0 ,\nwhere c p is the pth coefficient of f . Furthermore, if O f = Z then\n(\na p (E) mod l\nif p \u2224 N,\ncp \u2261\n\u00b1(1 + p) mod l if p || N and p \u2224 N0 .\nProof. This arose from combining modularity with level-lowering results by Ribet [36,\n37]. The strengthening in the case O f = Z is due to Kraus and Oesterl\u00e9 [33]. A detailed\nexploration is given, for example, in Chapter 2 of [15].\n\u0003\nRemark 3.4. Let E/Q be an elliptic curve with conductor N. Note that the exponents of\nthe primes in the factorization of N are uniformly bounded (see Section 10 in Chapter IV\nof [42]). In particular, only primes of bad reduction divide N and if E has multiplicative\nreduction at p then p || N.\nCorollary 3.5.

The Frey curve already given in Section 3.2\ncan be seen as sufficient; however, for ease of reference we give a construction from [6].\nLet\nF(x, y) = t0 a3 + t12 y + t2 xy2 + t3 y3 \u2208 Z[x, y]\nbe a separable cubic binary form. In [6] a Frey curve is given for the Diophantine equation\nF(a, b) = dcl ,\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhere gcd(a, b) = 1, d \u2208 Z is fixed and l \u2265 7 is prime.

Consider the Galois representation\n\u03c1a,b\nl : Gal(Q\u0304/Q) \u2192 Aut(E a,b [l]).\nTheorem 3.11 ([6]). Let S be the set of primes dividing 2d\u2206F .

This is Theorem 2.3 and Lemma 2.4 in [6].\n\n\u0003\n\n4. Proof of Theorem 1.2\nProof of Theorem 1.2. Let n = 2 or 3 and let S be the set of primes dividing n\u2206E . Assume\nthat Bm is an lth power. Note that by Theorem 1.1 in [24] it is enough to bound l in terms\nof E and P. To do this we shall derive an equation of the form (3.3) and prove the existence\nof a prime divisor p0 to which Corollary 3.5 can be applied.\nUsing Theorem 2.5, fix e0 \u2265 1 such that\n\u2022 Bne0 is divisible by a prime p0 \u2224 n\u2206E ,\n\u2022 p0 \u2224 Bne for all 0 \u2264 e < e0 .\n\n\fPERFECT POWERS IN ELLIPTIC DIVISIBILITY SEQUENCES\n\n9\n\nNote that e0 does not depend on m. From Lemma 2.1, since ordn (B1 ) > 0,\nordn (Bm ) \u2212 (ordn (B1) + ordn (m)) = O(1).\nHence, since l | ordn (Bm ), we can assume that l is large enough so that\nordn (m) \u2265 e0 .\n\n(4.1)\nFor Q \u2208 E(Q), using (3.1) gives\n(4.2)\n\n2\n\n2\n\u03b8n (AQ /B2Q )\nB2n\nAnQ\nQ \u03b8n (AQ /BQ )\n=\n=\n,\nB2nQ \u03c82n (AQ /B2Q ) B2 \u03c82n (AQ /B2 )B2(n2\u22121)\nQ\nQ Q\n\nwhere\n2\n\n\u22121)\n=\n\u03c82n (AQ /B2Q )B2(n\nQ\n\n(\n\nK2E (AQ , B2Q )\n(K3E (AQ , B2Q ))2\n\nif n = 2,\nif n = 3\n\n(see Definition 3.7). Since \u03b8n is monic and the leading coefficient of \u03c82n is n2 , BQ is coprime\nwith the numerator of (4.2) and if BnQ is an lth power then BQ is a power of n multiplied\nby an lth power. Write m = nordn m m\u2032 with n \u2224 m\u2032 . From (4.1) it follows that Bne0 m\u2032 is a\npower of n multiplied by an lth power. Write Q = ne0 \u22121 m\u2032 P then ne0 m\u2032 P = nQ. The primes\nwhich divide the numerator and the denominator of (4.2) also divide the discriminant \u2206E\n(see [1]). So\n(4.3)\n\nKnE (AQ , B2Q ) = uC l ,\n\nwhere u \u2208 Z\u2217S . Moreover, p0 \u2224 BQ (since gcd(BQ , Bne0 ) = Bne0 \u22121 ) and so C \u2208 Z is divisible\nby p0 . In characteristic away from n the multiplication by n map is separable (see Chapter\nIII of [43]) so the set of primes which divide the discriminant of KnE is equal to S . Applying\nProposition 3.10 shows that there exists a newform f of level N0 (as in (3.4)). It follows that\nthere are finitely many choices for f . We have p0 \u2224 lN0 and p0 | NAQ ,BQ (see Proposition\n3.9) so Corollary 3.5 bounds l.\n\u0003\nRemark 4.1. Note that KnE (AQ , B2Q ), as in (4.3), does not belong to Z\u2217S so Theorem 8.1\nin [3] along with Silverman's primitive divisor theorem proves the existence of an effectively computable bound for l which depends only on E and P. However, keeping in mind\nthat p0 \u2224 lN0 , in practice a much better bound is obtained by computing the newforms at\nlevel N0 and applying Proposition 3.3 directly.\nRemark 4.2. Let S be a finite set of fixed primes and let (Bm ) be an elliptic divisibility\nsequence whose first term is divisible by 2 or 3 . The results in Section 3.2 hold with the\nprimes in S added to S F . Using this the proof above can be extended to show that there\nare finitely terms in (Bm ) equal to a perfect power multiplied by an S -unit.\n5. The Mordell curves y2 = x3 + D\nProof of Theorem 1.4. Write D = d2 D\u2032 , where D\u2032 is square free. Suppose\nthat P \u2208 E(Q)\n\u221a\nwith x(P) , 0 and BP = zl for some prime l.

Note that u and v are non-zero in (5.1) and at least one of u, v\nis non-zero in (5.2); it follows that the cubic forms considered are separable. Construct a\nFrey curve Ea,b as in (3.6). Let S be the set of primes dividing 2d\u2206F .\nAssume that n | B1 and n > 1 is prime. Using the Siegel-Mahler theorem about finiteness of S -integral points on elliptic curves, fix e0 \u2265 1 such that Bne0 is divisible by a prime\np0 < S . Note that e0 does not depend on m. From Lemma 2.1, since ordn (B1) > 1,\nordn (Bm ) \u2212 (ordn (B1) + ordn (m)) = O(1).\nHence, since l | ordn (Bm ), we can assume l is large enough so that\nordn (m) \u2265 e0 .\nThen Bne0 | Bm and, in particular, p0 | Bm . Applying Theorem 3.11 and Proposition 3.3\nwith p = p0 gives that l is bounded. (Note that p0 divies the conductor of the Frey curve but\nnot the level of the newform.) The finiteness claim follows from Theorem 1.1 in [24]. \u0003\nLet D \u2208 Z be square-free. For P \u2208 2E(Q) write P = 2Q.

Suppose that BP is an lth power\nand that BQ is even. Since D is square-free, gcd(AQ , C Q ) = 1 so only 3 can divide both C Q\nand the numerator of (5.3). If gcd(3, C Q ) = 1 then C Q and 2BQ must be an lth powers.\nProof of Proposition 1.5. Note that E(Q) = h(\u22127/4, 19/8)i. Let P = m(\u22127/4, 19/8) for\nsome m \u2265 1 and denote BP , as in (1.2), by Bm. Assume that BP is an lth power. Using\nLemma 2.3 we can assume that 3 \u2224 BP and 3 \u2224 m. From Lemma 2.1,\n(5.4)\n\nord2 (Bm) = ord2 (B1) + ord2 (m) = 1 + ord2 (m) \u2265 l\n\nso m is even. Thus P = 2Q for some Q \u2208 E(Q). By (5.3) it follows that C Q and 2BQ are\nlth powers.\nLemma 5.1. If l > 2 then 13, 19 and 619 divide BQ . Also 7 | AQ but 7 \u2224 BQC Q .\nProof. If l > 2 then (5.4) gives that m = 4m\u2032 thus Q = 2m\u2032 (\u22127/4, 19/8) for some m\u2032 \u2265 1\nso B2 | BQ and, in particular, 19 | BQ . Using Lemma 2.1 again,\nord19 (BQ ) = ord19 (B2 ) + ord19 (m\u2032 ) = 1 + ord19 (m\u2032 ) = l\n\nso ord19 (m\u2032 ) > 0 and, in particular, 13 | BQ . Similarly, B13 | BQ so 619 | BQ .\n\n\fPERFECT POWERS IN ELLIPTIC DIVISIBILITY SEQUENCES\n\n11\n\nSince 7 | B3 and gcd(BP , B3) = 2, we have that 7 \u2224 BP so, from (5.3), 7 \u2224 BQC Q .\nReducing the equation C Q2 \u2212 11B6Q = A3Q modulo 7 shows that AQ \u2261 0 mod 7.\n\u0003\nAssume that l \u2265 5.

If l = 2\nthen (5.7) becomes \u22123C\u0304 2 + ( B\u03042 )3 \u2212 23 11(2B2)6 = 0 and Proposition 6.5.9. in [12] gives a\nrational point on the elliptic curve given by Y 2 = X 3 \u2212 2376, but there are no such points.\nIf l = 3 then (5.8) becomes C\u0304 3 + 3(\u2212 B\u03043)3 + (2C 2 )3 = 0 and Proposition 6.4.14 in [12] gives\na rational point with non-zero coordinates on the elliptic curve given by Y 2 = X 3 + 144,\nbut there are no such points.\nFor the other parameterizations details are given only for (u, v) = (10, 3). The other\ncases are similar. Assume that (u, v) = (10, 3). Then AQ = a2 \u2212 11b2 ,\nB3Q = 3a3 + 30a2 b + 99ab2 + 110b3\nand\nC Q = 10a3 + 99a2 b + 330ab2 + 363b3 .\nSuppose that l = 2. Since C Q and 2BQ are squares, multiplying the two expressions gives\na rational point on the hyperelliptic curve\nF : Y 2 = 60X 6 + 1194X 5 + 9900X 4 + 43780X 3 + 108900X 2 + 144474X + 79860.\nBut computations implemented in MAGMA confirm that the Jacobian of F has rank 0 and,\nvia the method of Chabauty, F(Q) is empty. Finally, suppose that l = 3. By Lemma 5.1,\nAQ \u2261 0 mod 7. Hence, a/b \u2261 2 or 5 mod 7. Substituting these in the parametrization\nof B3Q shows that a/b \u2261 5 mod 7, but this cannot be a solution if C Q is a cube. This\ncompletes the proof of Proposition 1.5.\n\u0003\nBy (5.1) and (5.2) we see that Conjecture 1.6 would follow from\nConjecture 5.2 ([6]). Let F be a seperable homogenous cubic binary form with integer\ncoefficients, d a fixed integer \u2265 1 and l a prime number. There exists a constant Cd,F > 0\ndepending only on d and F such that if l > Cd,F and\nF(a, b) = dcl\nwith gcd(a, b) = 1 then c = \u00b11.\nIn [6] it is explained that Conjecture 5.2 would follow from the Frey-Mazur conjecture.\nRemark 5.3. A more direct Frey curve for C P2 = A3P + DB6P with BP an lth power is\nE P : Y 2 = X 3 \u2212 3AP X + 2C P .\nHowever, parametrizing as above highlights the connection with cubic binary forms and,\nas in the proof of Proposition 1.5, helps resolve specific cases.\n\n\fPERFECT POWERS IN ELLIPTIC DIVISIBILITY SEQUENCES\n\n13\n\n6. The congruent number curves y2 = x3 \u2212 (2a pb )2 x\nLet E N be the elliptic curve given by y2 = x3 \u2212 N 2 x, where N is a congruent number.\nFor a non-torsion point P \u2208 E N (Q) there exists non-zero integers z1 , z2 , z3 so that\nAP\n\n=\n\n\u03b11 z21 ,\n\nAP + NB2P\n\n=\n\n\u03b12 z22 ,\n\nNB2P\n\n=\n\n\u03b13 z23 ,\n\nAP \u2212\n\nwhere the \u03b1i are square free.

The result is due to Wiles [50] for r = 0, Ribet [38] for r \u2265 2, and Darmon and\nMerel [17] for r = 1.\n\u0003\nLemma 6.2.

The only torsion points in E N (Q) are 2-torsion. If b is even then the\nrank of E N (Q) is zero (since it is zero when b = 0), so assume that b is odd. Assume that\nP \u2208 2E N (Q) is non-zero. The fundamental 2-descent map (see, for example, Section 8.2.3\nin [12]) shows that:\nAP\n\n=\n\nz21 ;\n\nAP \u2212 2a pb B2P\n\n=\n\nz22 ;\n\n=\n\nz23 .\n\nAP + 2a pb B2P\n\nSuppose that p divides AP exactly e times. Then e is even, e < b, and, by replacing AP\nby AP /pe and b by b \u2212 e, we can assume that p does not divide AP . Equations (6.2)-(6.4)\nbecome:\n\u22122a pb B2P\n\n2a pb B2P\n2a+1 pb B2P\n\nNow gcd(z j \u2212 zi , z j + zi ) divides 2z j and\n\n=\n=\n=\n\n(z2 \u2212 z1 )(z2 + z1 );\n\n(z3 \u2212 z1 )(z3 + z1 );\n\n(z3 \u2212 z2 )(z3 + z2 ).\n\n2a+1 pb B2P ,\n\nso is a power of 2.\n\n\f14\n\nJONATHAN REYNOLDS\n\nSuppose that BP is a perfect power. Now p divides z2 + (\u22121) s1 z1 and z3 + (\u22121) s2 z1 , where\ns1 , s2 \u2208 {0, 1}. So p divides z3 + (\u22121) s3 z2 , where s3 = s1 + s2 + 1.

So\n\u22122a pb B2P = (\u22121) s3+1 u(z2 + (\u22121) s1+1 z1 )(z3 + (\u22121) s3 z2 )\nand\n2a pb B2P = \u2212v(z3 + (\u22121) s2+1 z1 )(z3 + (\u22121) s3 z2 ).\n\nDividing the two equations gives\n\nz3 + (\u22121) s2+1 z1\nu\n= (\u22121) s3+1\n.\nv\nz2 + (\u22121) s1+1 z1\nBut\n\nz3 + (\u22121) s2+1 z1\nz3 + (\u22121) s3 z2\n\u2212\n= (\u22121) s3 ,\nz2 + (\u22121) s1+1 z1 z2 + (\u22121) s1+1 z1\n\nthus u , v,\nv\nz2 + (\u22121) s1+1 z1\n= (\u22121) s3\n,\ns\n3\nz3 + (\u22121) z2\nv\u2212u\n\nand\n\nz2 + (\u22121) s1+1 z1\nz3 + (\u22121) s3 z2\nSo\n\n!\n\n!\n\u22122a pb B2P\nuv\nz2 + (\u22121) s1 z1\n.\n=\n=\nz3 + (\u22121) s3 z2\nu \u2212 v (z3 + (\u22121) s3 z2 )2\n\n\u2212uv\n\u2212 v)\nis a square.

Let N = 2a p where a = 0 or 1. Let P \u2208 E N (Q) non-torsion point\nwith x(P) \u2208 \u2212Q\u22172 and x(P) + N \u2208 pQ\u22172 . If m is even then the result follows from Theorem\n1.7. If m is odd then the fundamental 2-descent map (see, for example, 8.2.3 in [12]) shows\nthat \u03b11 = \u22121 and \u03b12 = p so \u03b13 = \u2212p.\nNow (6.3) becomes z22 + z23 = 2a+1 B2P and (6.4) becomes 2z21 + pz22 = pz23 so\nz22 + 2p(z1 /p)2 = z23 .\nCorollary 6.3.6 in [12] with the particular solution (1, 0, 1) gives dz2 = s2 \u2212 2pt2 , dz1 =\n2pst, dz3 = s2 + 2pt2 where s, t are coprime integers and d | 2p.\n\n\fPERFECT POWERS IN ELLIPTIC DIVISIBILITY SEQUENCES\n\n15\n\nIf d = \u00b11 then |z2 | = s2 \u2212 2pt2 , |z1 | = 2pst and |z3 | = s2 + 2pt2 . Since z1 is even, a = 0\nand substituting into (6.3) gives (s2 \u2212 2pt2 )2 + (s2 + 2pt2 )2 = 2B2P so\ns4 + 4p2 t4 = B2P .\nNow applying Theorem 1 in [4] shows that BP cannot be a perfect power.\nIf d = \u00b12 then |z2 | = 2s2 \u2212 pt2 , |z1 | = 2pst and |z3 | = 2s2 + pt2 , where s, t are coprime\nintegers. So a = 0 and substituting into (6.3) gives\n4s4 + p2 t4 = B2P .\nSo 4s4 = B2P \u2212 p2 t4 = (BP + pt2 )(BP \u2212 pt2 ). Since 2 \u2224 BP and p \u2224 BP , we have BP + pt2 =\n\u00b12s\u20324 and BP \u2212 pt2 = \u00b12t\u20324 where s\u2032 , t\u2032 are coprime and odd. Thus \u00b1s\u20324 \u00b1 t\u20324 = BP . Again\napplying Theorem 1 in [4] shows that if BP is a perfect power then it is a square or a cube,\nbut these remaining cases are well known (see 6.5.2 of [12] and 14.6.6 of [13]).\nFinally, the cases d = \u00b1p and d = \u00b12p give the same two parametrizations already\nconsidered above.\n\u0003\nReferences\n1.
