Thus, it is the most suitable\nbound-state approach to treat the light pseudoscalar\nmesons (those composed of the u, d and s quarks), for\nwhich dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DChSB) is\nessential. One solves the (\"gap\") DS equations (DSEs)\nSq\u22121 = (Sqfree )\u22121 \u2212 \u03a3q for the dynamically dressed\nquark propagators Sq , where q is the quark flavor (q =\nu, d, s, ...), Sqfree is the free quark propagator, and \u03a3q is\nthe quark self-energy. These dressed quark propagator\nsolutions are then employed in Bethe-Salpeter equations\n(BSEs) for the bound-state vertex \u0393qq\u0304\u2032 of the meson composed of the quark of the flavor q and antiquark of the\nflavor q \u2032 :\nZ\n\u2032\n[\u0393qq\u0304 ]ef = [Sq \u0393qq\u0304\u2032 Sq\u2032 ]gh [K]hg\n(1)\nef ,\nwhere e, f, g, h schematically represent spinor, color and\nflavor indices, integration is meant over loop momenta,\nand K is the interaction kernel. Solving Eq. (1) for \u0393qq\u0304\u2032\nalso yields Mqq\u0304\u2032 , the mass eigenvalue of the q q\u0304 \u2032 meson.\nTo obtain the chiral behavior as in QCD, DS and\nBS equations must be solved in a consistent approximation. The rainbow-ladder approximation (RLA), where\nDChSB is well-understood, is still the most usual approximation in phenomenological applications. This also\nentails that in both DSE and BSE (1) we employ the\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: davorh@phy.hr\naddress: blaschke@ift.uni.wroc.pl\n\u2021 Electronic address: kalinov@jinr.ru\n\u00a7 Electronic address: kekez@lei.irb.hr\n\u00b6 Electronic address: klabucar@phy.hr; Corresponding author; Senior Associate of Abdus Salam ICTP, Trieste, Italy\n\u2020 Electronic\n\nsame effective interaction kernel,\n2 ab\n[K(k)]hg\nef = i g D\u03bc\u03bd (k)eff [\n\n\u03bba \u03bc\n\u03bba\n\u03b3 ]eg [ \u03b3 \u03bd ]hf ,\n2\n2\n\n(2)\n\nso that the quark self energy in the gap DSE is\nZ 4\n\u03bba \u03bc\nd l 2 ab\n\u03bbb \u03bd\ng\nD\n(k)\n\u03b3\nS\n(l)\n\u03b3 .

For example, for renormalization-group improved\n(RGI) interactions (e.g., in Refs. [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]), it has\nthe form\nab\nab\ng 2 D\u03bc\u03bd\n(k)eff = 4\u03c0\u03b1eff (k 2 )D\u03bc\u03bd\n(k)free\n\n(4)\n\nab\nwhere D\u03bc\u03bd\n(p)free is the free gluon propagator, and\n2\n\u03b1eff (k ) is an effective running coupling. For large spacelike momenta (k 2 \u226b 1 GeV2 ), \u03b1eff (k 2 ) approaches the\nperturbative QCD running coupling \u03b1s (k 2 ) known from\nthe QCD renormalization group analysis, although it\nmust be modeled at low momenta.\nConcretely, in the present paper we recall and utilize\nthe results obtained i) in Refs. [7, 8] by using the RGI\nof Jain and Munczek [9], ii) in Ref. [10] by using the\nRGI gluon condensate-induced interaction [11], and iii)\nin Refs. [12, 13] by using the separable interaction [14].\nIn any case, such effective interactions must be modeled\nat least in the low-energy, nonperturbative regime in order to be phenomenologically successful \u2013 which above\nall means to be sufficiently strong in the low-momentum\ndomain to yield DChSB. In the chiral limit (and close\nto it), light pseudoscalar (P ) meson q q\u0304 bound states\n(P = \u03c0 0,\u00b1 , K 0,\u00b1 , \u03b7) then simultaneously manifest themselves also as (quasi-)Goldstone bosons of DChSB. This\nenables one to work with the mesons as explicit q q\u0304 bound\nstates, while reproducing the results of the Abelian axial\nanomaly for the light pseudoscalars, i.e., the amplitudes\nfor P \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and \u03b3 \u22c6 \u2192 P 0 P + P \u2212 . This is unique among\n\n\f2\nthe bound state approaches \u2013 e.g., see Refs. [3, 15, 16, 17]\nand references therein. Nevertheless, one keeps the advantage of bound-state approaches that from the q q\u0304 substructure one can calculate many important quantities\n(such as the pion, kaon and ss\u0304 pseudoscalar decay constants: f\u03c0 , fK and fss\u0304 ) which are just parameters in most\nof other chiral approaches to the light-quark sector. The\ntreatment [7, 8, 10, 18] of the \u03b7-\u03b7 \u2032 complex is remarkable\nin that it is very successful in spite of the limitations\nof RLA. (Very recently, during the work on the present\npaper, the first and still simplified DS treatments of \u03b7\nand \u03b7 \u2032 beyond RLA appeared [19, 20]. However, RLA\ntreatments will probably long retain their usefulness in\napplications where simple modeling is desirable, as in\nthe calculationally demanding finite-temperature calculations [13].) The RLA treatments of the \u03b7-\u03b7 \u2032 complex\nat first determined [7, 8, 18] the anomalous \u03b70 mass parameter by fitting the empirical \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 masses. More\nrecently, the treatment was improved by avoiding this\nfitting while retaining the phenomenologically successful\ndescription [10, 13]. Namely, the anomalous \u03b70 mass was\nno longer a free parameter but determined from the lattice results (on QCD topological susceptibility) through\nthe Witten-Veneziano (WV) relation [21, 22]. However,\nShore achieved [23, 24] what can be considered as a generalization of the WV relation, and the purpose of the\npresent paper is exploring the usage of this generalization in the DS context.\nThe paper is organized as follows: in the next section, we recapitulate the procedures and results of our\nprevious treatments [8, 10, 13] relying on the WV relation (17), and present in Table I also their extension to\nthe scheme of the four decay constants (and two mixing\nangles) of \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 . In Section III, we expose the usage\nof the pertinent Shore's equations [23, 24] in the context\nof DS approach. The last section concludes after giving\nthe results of solving the pertinent equations.\n\nII. \u03b7-\u03b7 \u2032 MASS MATRIX FROM\nWITTEN-VENEZIANO RELATION\n\nAll q q\u0304 \u2032 model masses Mqq\u0304\u2032 (q, q \u2032 = u, d, s) used in the\npresent paper, and corresponding q q\u0304 \u2032 bound-state amplitudes, were obtained in Refs. [7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 25] in\nRLA, i.e., with an interaction kernel which (irrespective\nof how one models the dynamics) cannot possibly capture the effects of the non-Abelian, gluon axial anomaly.\nThus, when we form the \u03b7-\u03b7 \u2032 mass matrix\n\u0015\n\u0014 2\n2\nM88 M80\n2\n,\nM\u0302NA\n=\n(5)\n2\n2\nM08\nM00\nin this case in the octet-singlet basis \u03b78 -\u03b70 of the (broken)\nflavor-SU(3) states of isospin zero,\n1\n\u03b78 = \u221a (u\u016b + dd \u0304\u2212 2ss\u0304),\n6\n\n1\n\u03b70 = \u221a (u\u016b + dd \u0304+ ss\u0304), (6)\n3\n\nthis matrix (5), consisting of our calculated q q\u0304 masses,\n2\n2\nM88\n\u2261 h\u03b78 |M\u0302NA\n|\u03b78 i =\n\n2\nM80\n\n\u2261\n\n2\nh\u03b78 |M\u0302NA\n|\u03b70 i\n\n=\n\n2\nM08\n\n=\n\n2\n2\nM00\n\u2261 h\u03b70 |M\u0302NA\n|\u03b70 i =\n\n1 2\n2\n2\n(Mss\u0304\n+ Mu\u016b\n),\n3\n2\n\n(7)\n\n\u221a\n\n2\n2\n2\n(Mu\u016b\n\u2212Mss\u0304\n) < 0, (8)\n3\n\n2 1 2\n2\n( M + Mu\u016b\n),\n3 2 ss\u0304\n\n(9)\n\nis purely non-anomalous (NA), vanishing in the chiral limit. In the isospin limit, to which we adhere\nthroughout, the pion is strictly decoupled from the gluon\nanomaly and Mu\u016b = Mdd\u0304 is exactly our model pion mass\nM\u03c0 . Also the unphysical ss\u0304 quasi-Goldstone's mass Mss\u0304\nresults from RLA BSE and does not include the contribution from the gluon anomaly. This is consistent\nwith the fact that due to the Dashen-Gell-Mann-OakesRenner (DGMOR) relation, it is in a good approximation\n[7, 8, 10, 13] given by\n2\n2\nMss\u0304\n= 2MK\n\u2212 M\u03c02 ,\n\n(10)\n\ni.e., by the kaon and pion masses protected from the\nanomaly by strangeness and/or isospin.\nIn our previous DS studies [7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 25], to\nwhich we refer for all model details, the phenomenology\nof the non-anomalous sector was successfully reproduced,\ne.g., f\u03c0 , fK , as well as the empirical masses M\u03c0 and MK\n(see the upper part of Table I), yielding a strongly non2\n(5). Its diagonalization leads to the eigendiagonal M\u0302NA\nstates known as the nonstrange-strange (NS-S) basis,\n1\n \u0304 ,\n\u03b7NS = \u221a (u\u016b + dd)\n2\n\n\u03b7S = ss\u0304 ,\n\n(11)\n\n2\n2\nand to M\u0302NA\n= diag[M\u03c02 , Mss\u0304\n]. In contrast to these masssquared eigenvalues, the experimental masses are such\nthat (M\u03c02 )exp \u226a (M\u03b72 )exp , and \u03b7 \u2032 is too heavy, (M\u03b7\u2032 )exp =\n958 MeV, to be considered even as the ss\u0304 quasi-Goldstone\nboson. This is the well-known UA (1) problem, resolved\nby the fact that the complete \u03b7-\u03b7 \u2032 mass matrix M\u0302 2 must\ncontain the anomalous (A) part M\u0302A2 . That is, M\u0302 2 =\n2\nM\u0302NA\n+ M\u0302A2 .\nHowever, M\u0302A2 is inaccessible to RLA which yields our\nGoldstone pseudoscalars. In Refs. [7, 8, 10, 12, 13], M\u0302A2\nwas extracted from lattice data through the WV relation\n[the second equality in Eq. (17)]. The purpose of the\npresent paper, instead, is to approach \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 through\nShore's [23, 24] recent generalization of that relation.\nBefore that, however, we review the usage of the\nWV relation in Refs. [7, 8, 10, 12, 13]. The expansion in the large number of colors, Nc , indicates that the\nleading approximation in that expansion describes the\nbulk of main features of QCD. The gluon anomaly is suppressed as 1/Nc and can be viewed as a perturbation in\nthe large Nc expansion. In the SU(3) limit [compare Eqs.\n\n\f3\n(12) and (13)], it is coupled only to the singlet combination \u03b70 (6); only the \u03b70 mass receives, from the gluon\nanomaly, a contribution which, unlike quasi-Goldstone\n2\n, does not vanish in the\nmasses Mqq\u0304\u2032 's comprising M\u0302NA\nchiral limit. As discussed in Refs. [7, 10], in the present\nbound-state context it is thus meaningful to include the\neffect of the gluon anomaly just on the level of a mass\nshift for the \u03b70 as the lowest-order effect, and retain the\nq q\u0304 bound-state amplitudes and the corresponding mass\neigenvalues Mqq\u0304 as calculated by solving DSEs and BSEs\nwith kernels in RLA.\nReferences [7, 8, 10, 12, 13] thus break the UA (1)\nsymmetry, and avoid the UA (1) problem, by shifting the\n\u03b70 (squared) mass by an amount denoted by 3\u03b2 (in the\nnotation of Refs. [8, 10]). The complete mass matrix\n2\nM\u0302 2 = M\u0302NA\n+ M\u0302A2 then contains the anomalous part\nM\u0302A2\n\n= diag[0, 3\u03b2] ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere the anomalous \u03b70 mass shift 3\u03b2 is related to\nthe topological susceptibility of the vacuum, but in the\npresent approach must be treated as a parameter to be\ndetermined outside of our RLA model, i.e., fixed by phenomenology or taken from the lattice calculations [26].\n(The possibility of employing an additional microscopic\nmodel for the gluon anomaly contribution, such as the\none of Ref. [27], is presently not considered.)\nThe SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking and its interplay with the gluon anomaly modifies [10] M\u0302A2 (12) to\n#\n\"\n\u221a\n2\n2\n2\n(1\n\u2212\nX)\n(1\n\u2212\nX)(2\n+\nX)\n2\n3\n3\n,\nM\u0302A = \u03b2 \u221a2\n1\n2\n3 (1 \u2212 X)(2 + X)\n3 (2 + X)\n(13)\nwhere X is the flavor symmetry breaking parameter. It is\nmost often estimated as X = f\u03c0 /fss\u0304 \u223c 0.7\u22120.8 (see, e.g.,\nRefs. [8, 10, 28, 29], although there are some other [8], of\ncourse related, estimates of X). Presently we also adopt\nX = f\u03c0 /fss\u0304 , which means that X is a calculated quantity\nin our approach. The employed models achieved good\nagreement with phenomenology [7, 8, 10, 13], e.g., fitted\nthe experimental value of M\u03b72 + M\u03b72\u2032 for \u03b2 around 0.26 \u2013\n0.28 GeV2 . The anomaly contribution M\u0302A2 then brings\nthe complete M 2 rather close to a diagonal form for all\nconsidered models [7, 8, 10, 13]; that is, to diagonalize\nM 2 , only a relatively small rotation (|\u03b8| \u223c 13\u25e6 \u00b1 2\u25e6 ) of\nthe \u03b78 -\u03b70 basis states,\n\u03b7 = cos \u03b8 \u03b78 \u2212 sin \u03b8 \u03b70 ,\n\n\u03b7 \u2032 = sin \u03b8 \u03b78 + cos \u03b8 \u03b70 , (14)\n\nis needed to align them with the mass eigenstates, i.e.,\nwith the physical \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 .

Of course, this is again in agreement with\nphenomenological requirements [8, 10], since \u03c6 is fixed\nto the \u03b78 -\u03b7\u221a0 state-mixing angle \u03b8 by the relation \u03c6 =\n\u03b8 + arctan 2 = \u03b8 + 54.74\u25e6 .

Thus, \u03b2 does not need to be a free\nparameter, but can be determined from lattice results on\n\u03c7YM , so that no fitting parameters are introduced. For\nthe three models [9, 11, 14] utilized in our treatments\n[7, 8, 10, 13] of \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 , the bare quark mass parameters\nand the interaction parameters were fixed already in the\nnon-anomalous sector, by requiring the good pion and\nkaon phenomenology. (See the \u03c0 and K masses and decay constants in the uppermost part of Table I.) Then,\nfollowing Refs. [10, 13] in adopting the central value\nof the weighted average of the recent lattice results on\nYang-Mills topological susceptibility [30, 31, 32],\n\u03c7YM = (175.7 \u00b1 1.5 MeV)4 ,\n\n(18)\n\nwe have obtained the good descriptions of the \u03b7-\u03b7 \u2032 phenomenology [7, 8, 10, 13], exemplified by the first three\ncolumns (one for each DS models used) of the middle\npart of Table I, giving the predictions for the \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032\nmasses and for the NS-S mixing angle \u03c6.\nThe lowest part of the table, below the second horizontal dividing line, contains the results on the quantities\n(\u03b80 , \u03b88 , etc.) defined in the scheme with four \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 decay constants and two mixing angles, introduced and explained in the following Section III. Table I also compares\nthese results of ours (in the first three columns) with\nthe corresponding results of Shore's approach [23, 24], in\nwhich the experimental values of the meson masses M\u03c0 ,\nMK , M\u03b7 , and M\u03b7\u2032 , as well as the decay constants f\u03c0 and\nfK (in contrast to our q q\u0304 bound-state model predictions\nfor these quantities) are used as inputs enabling the calculation of various decay constants in the \u03b7-\u03b7 \u2032 complex\nand the two mixing angles \u03b80 and \u03b88 (corresponding to\n\u03c6 = 38.24\u25e6 in our approach).\n\n\f4\nIII.\n\nUSAGE OF SHORE'S EQUATIONS IN DS\nAPPROACH\n\nThe WV relation was derived in the lowest-order approximation in the large Nc expansion.

[8, 10, 13], compared with the results of Shore's analysis [23, 24] and with the experimental results. The first column was obtained by the WV-recalculation of the results of\nRef. [8], which in turn used the Jain-Munczek Ansatz for\nthe gluon propagator [9]. Column 2: the results based on\nRef. [10], which used the OPE-inspired, gluon-condensateenhanced gluon propagator [11]. Column 3: the results based\non Ref. [13], which utilized the separable Ansatz for the\ndressed gluon propagator [14]. Column 4: The results of\nShore [23, 24], who used the lattice result \u03c7YM = (191 MeV)4\nof Ref. [31], and not the weighted average (18), in contrast\nto us. Column 5: the experimental values. All masses and\ndecay constants are in MeV, and angles are in degrees. For\nmore details, see text.\n\nwhere A is the full QCD topological charge parameter,\nand f\u03b70\u2032 , f\u03b70 , f\u03b78\u2032 , f\u03b78 are the four decay constants [33, 34,\n35] associated with the two isoscalar pseudoscalars \u03b7 and\n\u03b7\u2032 .\nThe nonperturbative parameter A is related to the\nQCD topological susceptibility, quark condensates and\nquark masses [23, 24]. At large Nc , it should be wellapproximated by the topological susceptibility, A \u2248 \u03c7.\nMore precisely, it reduces to the YM topological susceptibility in the large Nc limit: A = \u03c7YM +O(1/Nc ), but at\npresent it is not known better than that, as there are still\nno lattice data on this nonperturbative QCD parameter.\nTherefore, in his own phenomenological analysis, Shore\nhimself had to approximate A by a value of \u03c7YM [23, 24].\nIn that sense, because of this crucial assumption based\non the lowest-order 1/Nc approximation, even his analysis was not (and, because of the lack of the corresponding\nlattice data, could not be) carried out numerically consistently in the orders of Nc , even though his formulas\nare valid in all orders in the 1/Nc expansion.\nWhile the present bound-state DS approach clearly\ncannot improve on the consistency aspect, it offers the\npossibility of a phenomenological analysis entirely different from Shore's. Namely, in addition to A \u2248 \u03c7YM , Shore\nused the experimentally known quantities (pion, kaon, \u03b7\nand \u03b7 \u2032 masses, as well as the pion and kaon decay constants) as inputs in Eqs. (19)-(21) to obtain the \u03b7 and\n\u03b7 \u2032 decay constants f\u03b70\u2032 , f\u03b70 , f\u03b78\u2032 , f\u03b78 . On the other hand,\nthe predicting power of our bound-state DS approach is\nmuch larger: not only are pion and kaon masses and decay constants calculated quantities, predicted from the\nq q\u0304 substructure, but once we formulate the incorporation of Shore's generalization within the bound-state DS\napproach, it will become obvious that also these four \u03b7\nand \u03b7 \u2032 decay constants and their masses M\u03b7 and M\u03b7\u2032\ncome out as pure predictions. Such a phenomenological\nanalysis, complementary to Shores, motivates us to formulate and perform the treatment based on Shore's generalization, instead of the original WV relation (or fitting\nthe anomalous \u03b70 mass shift) as in our earlier references\n[7, 8, 10, 13, 18].\nAdding Eqs. (19) and (21), one gets the relation\n(f\u03b70\u2032 )2 M\u03b72\u2032 + (f\u03b70 )2 M\u03b72 + (f\u03b78 )2 M\u03b72\n2\n2\n+ (f\u03b78\u2032 )2 M\u03b72\u2032 \u2212 2fK\nMK\n= 6A\n\n(22)\n\nwhich is the analogue of the standard WV formula (17),\nto which it reduces in the large Nc limit where A \u2192 \u03c7YM ,\nthe f\u03b70\u2032 , f\u03b78 , fK \u2192 f\u03c0 limit, and the limit of vanishing subdominant decay constants (since \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 are dominantly\n\u03b78 and \u03b70 , respectively), i.e., f\u03b70 , f\u03b78\u2032 \u2192 0. However, we\nwill need to use not just this single equation, but the\nthree equations (19)-(21) from Shore's generalization.\nThese four \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 decay constants are often parameterized in terms of two decay constants, f8 and f0 ,\nand two mixing angles, \u03b88 and \u03b80 :\nf\u03b78 = cos \u03b88 f8 ,\n\nf\u03b70 = \u2212 sin \u03b80 f0 ,\n\n(23)\n\n\f5\nf\u03b78\u2032 = sin \u03b88 f8 ,\n\nf\u03b70\u2032 = cos \u03b80 f0 .\n\n(24)\n\nThis is the so-called two-angle mixing scheme, which\nshows explicitly that it is inconsistent to assume that the\nmixing of the decay constants follows the pattern (14) of\nthe mixing of the states \u03b78 and \u03b70 [28, 29, 33, 34, 35, 36,\n37].\nThe advantage of our model is that, as we shall see,\nwe are able to calculate the f8 and f0 parts of the physical decay constants (23)-(24) from the q q\u0304 substructure.\nHowever, we cannot keep the full generality of Shore's\napproach, which allows for the mixing with the gluonic\npseudoscalar operators, and therefore employs the definition [23, 24] of the decay constants which, in general,\ndue to the gluonic contribution, differs from the following standard definition through the matrix elements of\nthe axial currents Aa \u03bc (x):\nh0|Aa \u03bc (x)|P (p)i = ifPa p\u03bc e\u2212ip*x , a = 8, 0; P = \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 .\n(25)\nNevertheless, Shore's definition [23, 24] coincides with\nthe above standard one in the non-singlet channel, where\nthere cannot be any admixture of the pseudoscalar gluonic component. Similarly, since our BS solutions (from\nRefs. [7, 8, 10, 13]) are the pure q q\u0304 states, without any\ngluonic components, using Shore's definition would not\nhelp us calculate the gluon anomaly influence on the decay constants. We thus employ the standard definitions\n(25), also used by, e.g., Gasser, Leutwyler, and Kaiser\n[33, 34, 35], as well as by Feldmann, Kroll, and Stech\n(FKS) [28, 29, 37].\nIn Eqs. (23)-(24), the angles are chosen so [28] that\n\u03b88 = \u03b80 = \u03b8 = 0 in the limit of the exact SU(3) flavor symmetry, since only then there are just two decay constants, purely octet f\u03b78 = f8 and purely singlet\nf\u03b70\u2032 = f0 , while the off-diagonal decay constants vanish,\nf\u03b70 = 0 = f\u03b78\u2032 , in this limit. Otherwise, all four decay constants (25) are different from zero due to the breaking of\nthe SU(3) flavor symmetry, since this leads to \u03b8 6= 0 and\ngives both \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 the both components \u03b78 and \u03b70 . [In\nthe parameterization (23)-(24), the angles \u03b88 and \u03b80 differ from \u03b8 since also h0|A8\u03bc |\u03b70 i =\n6 0 6= h0|A0\u03bc |\u03b78 i.] Thus,\nalthough not \u03b78 but \u03b70 couples to the gluon anomaly, the\noctet-chanel constants f\u03b78 and f\u03b78\u2032 are influenced by the\ngluon anomaly through its interplay with the SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking [similarly to the anomalous mass\nmatrix (13) having nonvanishing 88, 08 and 80 elements\nwhen X 6= 1].\nEquivalently to f\u03b70\u2032 , f\u03b78 , f\u03b70 , and f\u03b78\u2032 , defined by\nEq. (25), one has four related but different constants\nNS\nf\u03b7NS\n, f\u03b7S , and f\u03b7S\u2032 , if instead of octet and singlet axial\n\u2032 , f\u03b7\ncurrents (a = 8, 0) in Eq.

For example, fNS fS sin(\u03c6NS \u2212 \u03c6S ) differs from zero just by an\nOZI-suppressed term [28]. Neglecting this term thus implies \u03c6NS = \u03c6S . (Refs.

In general, neglecting the\nOZI-suppressed terms, i.e., application of the OZI rule,\nleads to the so-called FKS scheme [28, 29, 37], which\nexploits a big practical difference between the (in principle equivalent) parameterizations (23)-(24) and (29)(30): while \u03b88 and \u03b80 differ a lot from each other and\nfrom the octet-singlet state mixing angle \u03b8 \u2248 (\u03b88 + \u03b80 )/2,\nthe NS-S decay-constant mixing angles are very close to\neach other and both can be approximated by the state\nmixing angle: \u03c6NS \u2248 \u03c6S \u2248 \u03c6. Therefore one can deal\nwith only this one angle, \u03c6, and express the physical \u03b7-\u03b7 \u2032\ndecay constants as\nq \uf8f9\n\"\n# \"\n#\uf8ee 1\n2\nf\u03b78 f\u03b70\nfNS cos \u03c6 \u2212fS sin \u03c6 \uf8f0 \u221a\n3 \uf8fb\nq3\n=\n.\n8\n0\n2\n1\nf\u03b7 \u2032 f\u03b7 \u2032\nfNS sin \u03c6 fS cos \u03c6\n\u221a\n\u2212\n3\n\n3\n\n(33)\nThis relation is valid also in our approach, where \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032\nare the simple \u03b7NS -\u03b7S mixtures (16).

Therefore, our decay constants are calculated quantities, fNS =\nfu\u016b = fdd\u0304 = f\u03c0 and fS = fss\u0304 , in agreement with the OZI\nrule. Our DS approach is thus naturally compatible with\nthe FKS scheme, and we can use the \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 decay constants (33) with our calculated fNS = f\u03c0 and fS = fss\u0304 in\nShore's equations (19)-(21).\n\nIV.\n\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nAll quantities appearing on the right-hand side of\nEqs. (19)-(21), namely M\u03c0 , MK , f\u03c0 , and fK , are calculated in our DS approach [8, 10, 13] (for the three dynamical models [9, 11, 14]), except the full QCD topological\ncharge parameter A. Since it is at present unfortunately\nnot yet known, we follow Shore and approximate it by\nthe Yang-Mills topological susceptibility \u03c7YM .\nOn the left-hand side of Eqs. (19)-(21), the model\nresults for fNS = f\u03c0 and fS = fss\u0304 and Eq. (33) reduce the unknown part of the four \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 decay constants f\u03b70 , f\u03b70\u2032 , f\u03b78 , and f\u03b78\u2032 , down to the mixing angle\n\u03c6. The three Shore's equations (19)-(21) can then be\nsolved for \u03c6, M\u03b7 and M\u03b7\u2032 , providing us with the up-\n\nInputs:\nfrom Ref. [8]\nfrom Ref. [10]\nfrom Ref.

Columns 1\nand 2: The results when the non-anomalous inputs for Eqs.\n(19)-(21), namely M\u03c0 , MK , f\u03c0 = fNS , fss\u0304 = fS and fK , are\ntaken from Ref. [8], which uses Jain\u2013Munczek Ansatz interaction [9]. Columns 3 and 4: The results for the non-anomalous\ninputs from Ref. [10] using OPE-inspired interaction nonperturbatively dressed by gluon condensates [11]. Columns 5 and\n6: The results for the inputs from Ref. [13] using the separable Ansatz interaction [14]. All masses and decay constants,\n1/4\nas well as \u03c7YM , are in MeV, and angles are in degrees.\n\nper three lines of Table II. For each of the three different dynamical models which we used in our previous\nDS studies [7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 25], these results are displayed for \u03c7YM = (175.7 MeV)4 as in Refs. [10, 13] and\nfor \u03c7YM = (191 MeV)4 [31] (adopted by Shore [23, 24]).\nThe lower part of the table, displaying various additional\nresults, is then readily obtained through Eq. (33) and/or\nthe useful relations (34)-(35) which give f8 , f0 , \u03b88 \u2212\u03c6 and\n\u03b80 \u2212 \u03c6 in terms of fNS = f\u03c0 and fS = fss\u0304 . Thus, unlike\nthe mixing angles, f0 and f8 do not result from solving\nof Eqs. (19)-(21), but are the calculated predictions of a\nconcrete dynamical DS model, independently of Shore's\nequations.\nFor all three quite different (RGI [9, 11] and non-RGI\n[14]) dynamical models which we used in our previous DS\nstudies [7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 25], the situation with the results\nturns out to be rather similar. Similar results from various models mean that the usage of Shore's generalization\nin conjunction with the DS approach does not help one\nto discriminate between various dynamical models and\nso draw conclusions on the dynamics. This is not surprising, as it has been established [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] that\nwhile a successful reproduction of static properties and\nother low-energy meson phenomenology requires interaction modeling at low momenta, it is possible to achieve\na satisfactory description of low-energy phenomenology\nfor many forms of model interactions as long as their integrated strength at low momenta (p2 < 1 GeV2 ) is sufficient to achieve a realistic DChSB. On the other hand,\nthis (similarity of our results from the very different models) has the advantage that our conclusions further below\nare not sensitive to the changes of the model dynamics.\nThe most conspicuous feature of our results is that \u03b7\nand \u03b7 \u2032 masses are both much too low when the weighted\naverage \u03c7YM = (175.7 \u00b1 1.5 MeV)4 of Refs. [30, 31, 32]\nis used, in contrast to the results from the standard WV\nrelation, displayed in Table I. If we single out just the\nhighest of these values (191 MeV)4 [31]), the masses improve somewhat. However, other results are spoiled \u2013\ne.g., the mixing angle \u03c6 becomes too high to enable agreement with the experimental results on \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decays,\nwhich require \u03c6 \u223c 40\u25e6 [10].\nWhen we turn to the lower parts of Tables I and II,\nwhere the results for the \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 decay constants, and\nthe corresponding two mixing angles \u03b80 and \u03b88 , are given,\nwe notice a feature common to all our results, as well as\nShore's (also given in Table I). The diagonal ones, f\u03b70\u2032\nand f\u03b78 , are all of the order of f\u03c0 , being larger by some\n10% to 30%. The off-diagonal ones, f\u03b78\u2032 and f\u03b70 , are, on\nthe other hand, in general strongly suppressed. This is\nexpected, as \u03b7 \u2032 is mostly singlet, and \u03b7 is mostly octet.\nTo understand the dependence of the decay constants on the topological susceptibility \u03c7YM (approximating A), it is important to note that our f0 , which in a\nfull QCD bound-state calculation would be influenced by\nthe gluon anomaly, presently is not, since it is calculated\n(same as f8 ) from the modeled meson q q\u0304 substructure\nrelying on RLA. In Tables I and II one therefore sees no\n\n\f7\n\u03c7YM -dependence of not only f8 , but also of f0 , since the\ndifference between f0 and f8 is presently generated only\nby their different NS and S quark content. This feature\nis not only consistent with the FKS scheme, but is in\nfact a general characteristic of this scheme. Namely, due\nto the neglect of OZI-violating contributions [28], in the\nSU(3) flavor symmetry limit one would have fNS = fS\nand f0 = f8 . (The DS approach will be able to obtain\nthe gluon anomaly dependence of f0 only when it manages to go beyond RLA, which is presently achieved only\nwith schematic, very simplified \u03b4-function-type interactions [20].) Thus, not only in the present DS calculation,\nbut in fact in any application of the FKS scheme, the\n\u03c7YM -dependence of the four physical \u03b7-\u03b7 \u2032 decay constants\n(23)-(24) stems exclusively from the \u03c7YM -dependence of\nthe mixing angles \u03c6, \u03b88 and \u03b80 . Its origin, as explained in\nthe previous section, is in the interplay of the anomaly\nwith the flavor symmetry breaking. In fact, the FKS\nscheme is based on the assumption that the flavor symmetry breaking is significantly more important than the\nOZI-violating contributions (arising beyond RLA in DS\napproach).\nThe feature that may be surprising is that Shore's\nresults (which, to be sure, were obtained [23, 24] in quite\na different way from ours) are more similar to our results\nobtained through the standard WV relation, than to our\nresults obtained through Shore's Eqs. (19)-(21).\nTo summarize: the present paper has explored a\nmodification of the DS treatments of the \u03b7-\u03b7 \u2032 complex\nemployed in Refs. [7, 8, 10, 18]. In Refs. [7, 8, 18], the\nvalue of the anomalous \u03b70 mass shift was obtained by fitting, but Ref. [10] improved the treatment by obtaining\nit from the lattice through the WV relation. A generalization of this relation was recently proposed [23, 24],\nand the purpose of the present paper is to tests the usage\nthereof in the bound-state, DS context, and compare the\nresults with those from the standard WV relation.\nAll in all, inspection and comparison of the results in\nTable II with the results (in Table I) from the analogous\ncalculations but using the standard WV relation to construct the complete \u03b7-\u03b7 \u2032 mass matrix, leads to the conclusion that the DS approach with the standard WV relation\n(17) is phenomenologically more successful, yielding the\nmasses closer to the experimental ones. This may seem\n\n[1] For example, see Refs. [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] for recent reviews and\nreferences on various applications of the DS approach.\n[2] R. Alkofer and L. von Smekal, Phys.

This in general precludes a consistently improved 1/Nc treatment in spite of\nthe usage of Shore's relations. The problems with inconsistencies in the 1/Nc counting may well cause spoiling of\nresults, especially in an approach such as ours, where the\n\u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 masses are not inputs, but predicted quantities.\nOur results thus add a new argument to the motivation\nfor undertaking lattice calculations proposed by Shore\n[24] and aimed at proper finding the quantity A. Also,\nwe should recall from Sections I and II that the very usage\nof the RLA assumed that the anomaly is implemented on\nthe level of the anomalous mass only, as a lowest order\n1/Nc correction [7, 8, 10, 12, 13]. Thus, with respect to\nthe orders in 1/Nc, using Shore's generalization in the\npresent formulation of our DS approach may be less consistent than using the standard WV relation, which may\nwell be the cause of its lesser phenomenological success.\nIn spite of the lesser phenomenological success (than\nthe standard WV relation) in the present context of\nbound-state DS calculations at zero temperature, the\npresently exposed usage of Shore's generalization will\nlikely find its application at finite-temperature calculations in the DS context. Namely, there it may help alleviate the difficulties met due to the usage of the standard\nWV relation in the DS approach at T > 0, as discussed\nin Ref. [13].\nAcknowledgments\nD.H. and D.Kl. acknowledge the support of the\nproject No. 119-0982930-1016 of MSES of Croatia.
