Introduction\nOne of interesting features inherent in the theories with more than four spacetime dimensions is a possibility to explain the mysterious pattern of fermion mass hierarchies [1, 2, 3]\n(see also review [4] and references therein). In the previous series of works [2, 3, 5], we\nhave constructed a model in which a single family of fermions, with vector-like couplings to\nthe Standard Model (SM) gauge groups in 6 dimensions, gives rise to three generations of\nchiral Standard Model fermions in 4 dimensions. This mechanism is based on localization\nof fermion zero modes on a two-dimensional vortex with winding number n. In particular,\nin the paper [2] the case of global vortex (i.e. group of symmetry of the vortex Ug (1) is\nglobal) with winding number n = 3 was considered. In this setup three localized fermionic\nzero modes appear due to specific Yukawa coupling to the vortex scalar \u03a6. Coupling of\nfermions to the SM Higgs doublet H results in four-dimensional effective fermion masses.\nInter-generation mixings occur due to explicit breaking of Ug (1) symmetry. The latter\npoint is the main drawback of this model since it does not allow to gauge Ug (1) symmetry.\nIn the paper [3] this problem was overcome. The price for unbroken Ug (1), however, is the\nnecessity to invoke higher dimension operators in the scalar-fermion interactions1 . More\nprecisely, to obtain n fermionic generations we consider the vortex with winding number\n1 but fermions coupled to the vortex scalar raised to the nth power. In both cases (global\nand gauged Ug (1) symmetry) the hierarchical pattern of the fermion masses occurs due\nto different profiles of the fermionic wave functions in the transverse extra dimensions.\n1\n\nThe requirement of renormalizability of the theory does not make much sense anyway in the sixdimensional models, since even usual Yukawa scalar-fermion-fermion coupling is non-renormalizable.\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fNamely, in Refs. [2, 3] a crude dimensional analysis has been presented which shows that\nhierarchical mass pattern has the form\n1 : g2 : g4 ,\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere g is small Yukawa coupling, which yields the localization of fermionic modes. Also,\nin Refs. [2, 3] it has been pointed out that any exact prediction of the fermion masses (as\nwell as a check of the Eq.(1.1)) can be obtained only numerically.\nIn this paper we return to the models of Refs. [2, 3] and pay special attention to a\ncheck of the Eq.(1.1). We will see that this equation literally does not hold. Namely, in\nthe case of gauged vortex the hierarchical mass pattern takes the form\n1 : g : g2 .\nAt the same time, in the case of global vortex unnatural hierarchical pattern appears. We\nwill also evaluate fermion masses numerically. For reasonable values of parameters in the\ncase of the gauged vortex our results reproduce SM fermionic mass pattern. Furthermore,\nwe will obtain Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix for the same set of parameters,\nand see that six-dimensional theory reproduces the mixing matrix quite well.\n\n2. The Setup\nIn what follows we restrict ourselves to the model of Ref. [3]. In this section we give a brief\ndescription of this construction. Our notations coincide with those used in Refs. [2, 3].\nIn particular, six-dimensional coordinates xA are labeled by capital Latin indices A, B =\n0, . . . , 5. Four\u2013dimensional coordinates x\u03bc are labeled by Greek indices \u03bc, \u03bd = 0, . . . , 3.\nThe Minkowski metric is gAB = diag(+, \u2212, . . . , \u2212). We use also chiral representation for\nsix-dimensional Dirac \u0393-matrices (see Ref. [2]). Besides this we introduce polar coordinates\nr, and \u03b8 in the x4 , x5 plane.\nThe matter field content of the six-dimensional theory is summarized in Table 1. There\nare three scalar fields. One of these \u03a6, together with the Ug (1) gauge field, forms a vortex,\nwhile two other scalars, X and H, develop profiles localized on the vortex. The potential\nterm of the Lagrangian which gives rise to the non-trivial profiles for the scalar fields has\nthe following form\n\u00012 \u03ba\n\u00012\n\u00012\n\u03bb\n\u03c1\nVs =\n|\u03a6|2 \u2212 v 2 +\n|H|2 \u2212 \u03bc2 + h2 |H|2 |\u03a6|2 +\n|X|2 \u2212 v12 + \u03b7 2 |X|2 |\u03a6|2 . (2.1)\n2\n2\n2\nThere is also one fermionic generation which consists of five six-dimensional fermions\nQ, D, U , L and E. These fermions have vector-like coupling to SM gauge bosons, (a subtle\nissue of localization of the latters we do not discuss here), and axial couplings with the\nvortex background2\n1 \u2212 \u03937\n1 \u2212 \u03937\n1 \u2212 \u03937\nV1 = gq \u03a63 Q\u0304\nQ + gu \u03a6\u22173 \u016a\nU + gd \u03a6\u22173 D\u0304\nD+\n2\n2\n2\n(2.2)\n1 \u2212 \u03937\n1 \u2212 \u03937\ngl \u03a63 L\u0304\nL + ge \u03a6\u22173 \u0112\nE + h.c.\n2\n2\n2\n\nFor the scalar\u2013fermion interactions, we take the most general operators of the lowest order, consistent\nwith gauge invariance. On the other hand, in the scalar self\u2013interaction (2.1) there could be terms of the\nform \u03a6X \u2217 or \u03a6X \u2217 |H|2 which we do not include.

For convenience, we describe\nhere also the profiles of the classical scalar fields and fermionic wave functions in extra dimensions.\n\n(\u03937 is a six-dimensional analog of four-dimensional matrix \u03b35 ).\nNote that the scalar background \u03a63 , where the field \u03a6 has the winding number one,\n\u03a6 = F (r)ei\u03b8 , has exactly the same topological properties as the background \u03a61 of the\nvortex with winding number three, \u03a61 = F1 (r)e3i\u03b8 . As a result, the interactions Eq. (2.2)\ngive rise to three left\u2013handed (right\u2013handed) zero modes for each of the fermions Q, L (U ,\nD, E). All of these modes are localized in the core of the vortex3 , and could be identified\nwith the three generations of the chiral SM fermions. The last point, however, is not quite\nfair since these zero modes are massless from the four-dimensional point of view. To give\n\u221a\nsmall (compared to the vortex scale \u03bbv) masses to these modes we introduce the following\ninteractions of the fermions with the Higgs doublet H and singlet X\nV2 = Yd HX Q\u0304\n\n1 \u2212 \u03937\n1 \u2212 \u03937\n1 \u2212 \u03937\nD + Yu H\u0303X \u2217 Q\u0304\nU + Yl HX L\u0304\nE + h.c.,\n2\n2\n2\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere H\u0303\u03b1 = \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2 H\u03b2\u2217 , \u03b1, \u03b2 are SUW (2) indices. Finally, there is one more gauge invariant\nin the scalar\u2013fermions interaction\nV3 = Yd \u01ebd H\u03a6Q\u0304\n\n1 \u2212 \u03937\n1 \u2212 \u03937\n1 \u2212 \u03937\nD + Yu \u01ebu H\u0303\u03a6\u2217 Q\u0304\nU + Yl \u01ebl H\u03a6L\u0304\nE + h.c.,\n2\n2\n2\n\n(2.4)\n\n(we denote Yukawa coupling constants in Eq. (2.3) as Yu,d,l , and in Eq. (2.4) as Yu \u01ebu , . . .,\nfor convenience). This term yields inter-generation mixings.\nin the (2.2), can be forbidden, for example, by the imposition of Z4 discrete symmetry: \u03a6 \u2192 i\u03a6, Q \u2192\nexp(i\u03937 3\u03c0\n)Q, X \u2192 X. This symmetry is explisitly broken by the interaction (2.3), (2.4), and, therefore the\n4\nundesirable terms will be generated by the radiative corrections. However, the value of these corrections\n4\nY2\n(for the operator |H|2 \u03a6X \u2217 , for instance; \u039b is the cut off), and for our choice of the\nis of order (4\u03c0)\n3 \u01eb\u039b\n\u0001\n\u039b 4\n\u03bb, where M is mass scale, and \u03bb = 1/M 2 . So, if we choose\nparameters (see Sec. 5) is of order 10\u22126 M\nthe cut off to be of order \u039b \u223c 10M , then this corrections can be neglected.\n3\nThese modes were discussed in detail in Ref. [2].\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fIt is worth noting that to obtain small fermion masses and mixing, it is not necessary to\ntake Y or \u01eb small. Small masses and mixings originate from small overlaps of the fermionic\nwave functions and the scalar profiles.\nNow let us consider this model in more detail. First of all we will present stable nontrivial configuration for the scalars and Ug (1) gauge fields. Then we will find fermion zero\nmodes in this background. Finally, we will calculate the fermion masses and the CKM\nmatrix.\n\n3. The vortex background\nAs described in the previous section, in our model there are three scalar fields and one\nUg (1) gauge field which form a non-trivial vortex background. In this section we present a\nstable solution of the static field equations which meets all the requirements.\nThe set of the static equations to the background has the following form (prime denotes\nthe derivative with respect to r; e is Ug (1) gauge charge),\n\u0001\n1\n1\nF \u2032\u2032 + F \u2032 \u2212 2 F (1 \u2212 A)2 \u2212 \u03bbv 2 F F 2 \u2212 1 \u2212 h2 F H 2 \u2212 \u03b7 2 F X 2 = 0,\nr\nr\n1 \u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nA \u2212 A + 2e2 v 2 F 2 (1 \u2212 A) \u2212 2e2 H 2 A \u2212 2e2 X 2 A = 0,\nr\n1\n1\n\u2032\u2032\nH + H \u2032 \u2212 2 HA2 \u2212 h2 Hv 2 F 2 \u2212 \u03baH(H 2 \u2212 \u03bc2 ) = 0,\nr\nr\n1\n1\nX \u2032\u2032 + X \u2032 \u2212 2 XA2 \u2212 \u03b7 2 Xv 2 F 2 \u2212 \u03c1X(X 2 \u2212 v1 2 ) = 0,\nr\nr\n\n(3.1)\n\nwith the boundary conditions\nF (r) = 0, H \u2032 (r) = 0, X \u2032 (r) = 0, A(r) = 0,\nF (r) \u2192 1, H(r) \u2192 0, X(r) \u2192 0, A(r) \u2192 1,\n\nat r = 0,\nat r \u2192 \u221e.\n\n(3.2)\n\nHere we use the standard anzatz for Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen vortex (i, j = 4, 5)\nAi (x) = \u2212\n\n1\n\u01ebij xj A(r),\ner 2\n\nH\u03b1 (x) = \u03b42\u03b1 H(r),\n\n\u03a6(x) = vF (r)ei\u03b8 ,\nX(x) = X(r).\n\n(3.3)\n\nLet us briefly discuss the choice of the boundary conditions (3.2) and the anzatz (3.3).\nAt infinity the fields should tend to their vacuum expectation values (VEV) which are\ndetermined from the potential (2.1). In general at arbitrary set of the coupling constants\nthe potential (2.1) may admit several minima including those in which X and (or) H are\nnon-zero. However, there are several regions in the space of the parameters where the\npotential (2.1) has only one minimum \u03a6 = v, H = X = 0. In particular, one of the regions\nis determined by the conditions h4 > \u03bb\u03ba, \u03bb\u03c1 > \u03b7 4 , \u03b7 2 v 2 > \u03c1v12 , and in what follows we will\nassume that these conditions are satisfied.\nIn general, any configuration of the fields \u03a6, H, and X may be characterized by three\nH\nX\ntopological charges QT = (Q\u03a6\nT , QT , QT ). The zero VEVs of X and H admit the existence\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fof the topologically trivial configuration of these fields (3.3) (in spite of the interaction with\nwinded gauge field), QT = (1, 0, 0). In principle, there may exist a solution of the field\nequation with QT = (1, \u22121, 1) and with the same topological properties of the gauge field\nA\u03bc . However, as we will see, the solution with QT = (1, 0, 0) is stable, and, therefore, the\nchoice of the anzatz (3.3) is apropriate.\nAs mentioned in the previous section, scalar-fermion interactions (2.3), (2.4) generate\nlow energy mass terms for fermionic modes. Thus, to obtain non-zero fermion masses one\nshould have a non-trivial solution for H(r) and X(r). On the other hand, the boundary\nvalue problem (3.1), (3.2) always adopts trivial solutions H = 0 or (and) X = 0. Fortunately, it has been pointed out in [6], that in some region of parameters these trivial\nsolutions are unstable. Namely, the necessary conditions to have non-trivial stable solutions are h2 v 2 > \u03ba\u03bc2 and \u03b7 2 v 2 > \u03c1v12 [6]. However, it turns out that these conditions are\ninsufficient. To clarify the situation, let us study the problem of the stability in more detail.\nThe stability of the scalar \u03a6 and gauge fields is guaranteed by topology. To investigate\nthe stability of the static solution H(r) one linearizes equations of motion (3.1) and obtain\nSchr\u00f6dinger-type problem with the potential\nh2 v 2 F 2 (r) +\n\n1 2\nA \u2212 \u03ba(\u03bc2 \u2212 3H 2 (r)).\nr2\n\n(3.4)\n\np\nAt large r the solution of Eq.(3.1), H(r), has asymptotic H \u223c exp(\u2212 h2 v 2 \u2212 \u03ba\u03bc2 r).\nSo, at large enough h the Higgs profile becomes narrow compared to F (r). This means, in\nparticular, that there is a region of r where H(r) becomes negligible while A(r) and F (r)\nare still almost equal to zero. Therefore, the main contribution to the potential (3.4) in this\nregion comes from r-independent term \u2212\u03ba\u03bc2 and is negative. Thus, the potential becomes\nnot positively definite, and there may exist negative levels which mean the instability. The\nnumerical calculations show that this is the case.\nTo be specific, we have chosen the following set of the parameters: v = \u03bc = 1 * M 2 ,\nv1 = 0.3 * M 2 , \u03bb = \u03ba = \u03c1 = 1 * M \u22122 , h = 1.02 * M \u22121 , \u03b7 = 0.31 * M \u22121 , e = 0.04 * M \u22121 ,\nwhere M is a unit of mass which we will define in Section (5). In numerical calculations\nwe assume M = 1. To solve the boundary value problem (3.1), (3.2) we have used the\nrelaxation method [7]. The solutions for profiles F (r), H(r), X(r) and A(r) in the vicinity\nof the origin are presented in Figure 1. The potential (3.4) for these solutions is positive\nand, therefore, the solutions are stable.\nThe vortex background in the case of global Ug (1) group can be obtained from the\nEqs.(3.1), (3.2) by the setting e = 0, A(r) = 0 (A(\u221e) = 0). The profiles for the scalar\nfields have the same shapes as in the gauge case. We do not present the corresponding plot\nhere.\n\n4. Mass hierarchy: cases of global and gauged Ug (1)\nNow we have all ingredients to find fermionic zero modes in the vortex background and to\nobtain hierarchy of the low energy fermionic masses. To do this let us first briefly remind\nthe analysis given in Refs. [2, 3].\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\f1\nF (r)\nX(r)\nA(r)\nH(r)\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nFigure 1: Profiles of the background at \u03bb = \u03ba = \u03c1 = 1, v = \u03bc = 1, e = 0.04, h = 1.02, \u03b7 = 0.31,\nv1 = 0.3.\n\n4.1 Global Ug (1)\nLet us consider first the case of global Ug (1) group and one fermionic family, say Q and\nU . The part of the Lagrangian describing the interaction of six-dimensional spinor Q with\nvortex scalar \u03a6 is\n\u0013\n\u0012\nA\n3 1 \u2212 \u03937\nQ + h.c. .\n(4.1)\nLQ = iQ\u0304\u0393 \u2202A Q \u2212 gq \u03a6 Q\u0304\n2\nThis Lagrangian is invariant under Ug (1) rotations\nQ \u2192 ei\n\n3\u03b1\n\u0393\n2 7\n\nQ, \u03a6 \u2192 ei\u03b1 \u03a6.\n\nIn the vortex background, one can expand an arbitrary spinor in eigenfunctions of the\ncorresponding Dirac operator. There is a set of massive heavy modes (with masses of\norder gv 3 ) and zero modes. The careful analysis given in [8, 2, 3] shows that in the\nvortex background with winding number one there are exactly three localized zero modes\ndescribing four-dimensional left-handed spinors. To obtain three right-handed zero modes\none should consider a six-dimensional spinor U which has an axial charge \u22123/2 under Ug (1)\nwith the Lagrangian\n\u0012\n\u0013\nA\n3 1 + \u03937\nLU = i\u016a \u0393 \u2202A U \u2212 gu \u03a6 \u016a\nU + h.c. .\n(4.2)\n2\nThese left-handed and right-handed zero modes have the form\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nu4\u2212p (r)ei(1\u2212p)\u03b8\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec q (r)ei(3\u2212p)\u03b8 \uf8f7\n0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec p\n,\nU\n=\nQp = \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7 .\np\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed q4\u2212p (r)ei(1\u2212p)\u03b8 \uf8f8\n0\ni(3\u2212p)\u03b8\nup (r)e\n0\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n(4.3)\n\n\fHere p = 1, 2, 3 enumerates three modes (three fermionic generations).

We will present the numerical results hereinafter, now,\nhowever, let us consider the equations in more details.\nWe are interested in obtaining low energy fermion masses which originate from the\nintegration over extra dimensions of the following expression\nZ\n1 \u2212 \u03937\nU + h.c.\n(4.6)\nYu d2 xH\u0303X \u2217 Q\u0304\n2\nSubstituting here the zero modes (4.3), and integrating over polar angle \u03b8 one finds\nmups\n\n= Yu\n\nZ\n\nrdrd\u03b8H(r)X(r)qp (gq , r)us (gu , r)ei\u03b8(r\u2212s) =\n\nZ\u221e\n\u03b4ps 2\u03c0Yu rdrH(r)X(r)qp (gq , r)up (gu , r).\n\n(4.7)\n\n0\n\nIt is worth noting that due to orthogonality of the zero modes and due to the fact that\nH and X do not depend on \u03b8 the integral over \u03b8 leads to a selection rule, mups \u223c \u03b4ps . To\nobtain non-trivial inter-generation mixings one should also consider the term\nZ\n1 \u2212 \u03937\nU + h.c.\n(4.8)\nYu \u01ebu d2 xH\u0303\u03a6\u2217 Q\u0304\n2\nThe non-trivial \u03b8-dependence of \u03a6 (3.3) leads to the off-diagonal elements in the mass\nmatrix\nZ\nmups = Yu \u01ebu rdrd\u03b8H(r)\u03a6(r)qp (gq , r)us (gu , r)ei\u03b8(r\u2212s\u22121) =\nZ\u221e\n\u03b4p,s+1 2\u03c0Yu \u01ebu rdrH(r)\u03a6(r)qp(gq , r)up\u22121 (gu , r).\n0\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n(4.9)\n\n\fIn the same way one finds non-zero off-diagonal elements for down-type quarks mdps \u223c\n\u03b4p+1,s . Therefore, the mass matrices have the following form\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nm11 0\n0\nm11 m12 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nmu = \uf8ed m21 m22 0 \uf8f8 ,\nmd = \uf8ed\nm22 m23 \uf8f8 .\n0 m32 m33\n0\n0 m33\n\nTo evaluate the integrals (4.7) and (4.9) over r we take into account that the functions\nH(r) and X(r) are localized inside the vortex. So, the integral (4.7) is saturated near the\norigin, and therefore only the behavior of the zero modes at r \u2192 0 is relevant. It is easy to\nfind from equations (4.4) that qp \u223c r 3\u2212p at r \u2192 0, however, it is not so easy to obtain the\ndependence on gq of the zero modes. To obtain the dependence on small Yukawa couplings\ng of the fermion masses we should take into account the normalization condition (4.5) and\ninvestigate the behavior of the zero modes near the origin more carefully. To do this let us\nconsider the following simplified model.\nLet us approximate the vortex background by the functions\n(\nr3, r < 1\nv 3 F (r)3 =\n1, r \u2265 1\n(\n1, r < 1\nH(r) = X(r) =\n(4.10)\n0, r \u2265 1\n\nThese functions have the correct behavior at the origin and at infinity. So, this is a\nreasonable approximation. The zero mode equations (4.4) with the background Eq.(4.10)\nhave analytical solution in terms of modified Bessel functions. However, to clarify the\npicture, we present here only the leading dependence on g of the solutions at r < 1 (which\nis only relevant for our purposes), and exact solutions at r \u2265 1:\n(\n(\nC\u03032 r,\nr<1\nC \u03031 r 2 ,\nr<1\nq2 (r) = Cm r \u2212gq r\nq1 (r) =\nCr\n\u2212g\nr\nq\n\u221a e\n\u221a e\n, r\u22651\n, r\u22651\ngq\ngq\n(\nC \u03033 ,\nr<1\nq3 (r) =\n(4.11)\n1\nCr \u2212gq r\n\u221a\n(1 + gq r ), r \u2265 1\ngq e\n\nTo find the dependence on gq of the coefficients C and C\u0303 let us assume that the\nnormalization integral (4.5) is saturated at r \u2265 1. Then substituting the solutions (4.11)\n5/2\ninto the condition (4.5) one has C \u2243 Cm \u2243 gq . Thus, from the continuity of the solutions\nat r = 1, we find that C\u03031,2 \u2243 gq2 and C\u03033 \u2243 gq . This means in particular that our assumption\nis indeed valid: the normalization integrals at r < 1 are of order gq2 and can be neglected.\nNow we can find the mass pattern in this simplified model. Substituting the solutions\n(4.11) and background (4.10) into integral (4.7) we have the following dependence on gq,u\nof the fermion masses,\nm11 \u223c m22 \u223c (gq gu )2 ,\n\nm33 \u223c (gq gu ).\n\n(4.12)\n\nWe see that m11 and m22 are parametrically of the same order, and therefore there is no\nhierarchy in the case of global Ug (1). This result was confirmed by the numerical evaluation\nof the zero modes and the integral (4.7).\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\f4.2 Gauged Ug (1)\nLet us concentrate now on the case of the gauged Ug (1). In this case the equations for the\nzero modes can be obtained from (4.4) by the replacement\n\u2202r \u2192 \u2202r +\n\n3A(r)\n.\n2r\n\nTherefore, all dependence of the zero modes on the gauge field can be absorbed into a\nfactor\n\uf8eb r\n\uf8f6\nZ\n\u2032\n3A(r ) \u2032 \uf8f8\n(qp )gauge = exp \uf8ed\u2212\ndr * (qp )global .\n(4.13)\n2r \u2032\n\nApproximating the gauge field as\n\nA(r) =\nwe find the following zero modes\n(\nC \u03031 r 2 ,\nr<1\nq1 (r) =\n\u221aC e\u2212gq r , r \u2265 1\ngq r\nq3 (r) =\n\n(\n\n(\n\n0, r < 1\n1, r \u2265 1\n\nq2 (r) =\n\n(4.14)\n\n(\n\nC \u03033 ,\n\u221aC e\u2212gq r (1\ngq r\n\n+\n\n1\ngq r ),\n\nC\u03032 r,\nCm \u2212gq r\n\u221a\n,\ngq r e\n\nr<1\nr\u22651\n\nr<1\nr\u22651\n\n(4.15)\n\nThe situation changes drastically compared to the global Ug (1) group. The continuity\nat r = 1 results in the following relations between C \u0303p and C, Cm :\nC\u03031 = Cgq\u22121/2 ,\n\nC \u03032 = Cm gq\u22121/2 ,\n\nC \u03033 = Cgq\u22123/2 .\n\n(4.16)\n\nUsing the normalization condition (4.5) one obtains that the main contribution to the\nintegral (4.5) for the second mode comes from r > 1, and, so, Cm \u223c gq . However, the\nnormalization integral for the first and third modes is saturated now in the core r < 1 by\n3/2\nthe third mode. Thus, C \u223c gq and\n3\u2212p\n\nC\u0303p \u223c gq 2 .\n\n(4.17)\n\nWith the dependence (4.17), one finds the hierarchical mass pattern in the case of gauge\nvortex\n3\u2212p\n(4.18)\nmupp \u223c Yu (gu gq ) 2\nwhich was announced in the Introduction.\nIn the same way one estimates mixing terms from the Lagrangian (2.4), (4.8)\n3\u2212p\n\u221a\nmups \u223c \u03b4p,s+1 Yu \u01ebu gu (gu gq ) 2 ,\nand\n\n\uf8f6\ngu gq\n0 0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\u221a \u221a\nmu \u223c Yu \uf8ed \u01ebu gu gq gu gq 0 \uf8f8\n\u221a\n0\n\u01ebu gu 1\n\uf8eb\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n(4.19)\n\n(4.20)\n\n\fm\u030333\nm\u030332\nm\u030322\nm\u030321\nm\u030311\n\n0.001\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\nFigure 2: The g-dependence of the fermion mass pattern m\u0303ps = mps /g (6\u2212p\u2212s)/2 calculated in the\nbackground shown at Fig. 1.\n\nOf course, the vortex background obtained numerically differs from our crude approximation. In particular, one can see from Fig. 1 that the gauge field A(r) is wider than the\nscalar F (r), and even far outside the core is almost equal to zero. So, our approximation\n(4.14) is not quite appropriate. One may expect that in the real background (Fig. 1) the\ng-dependence of the mass pattern is more resembling with the dependence in the case of\nthe global Ug (1) group (4.12) when A(r) = 0. However, the numerical calculations show\nthat the mass pattern depends weakly on the width of the gauge field. We present in Fig. 2\nfive non-zero elements of the mass matrix (4.20) divided by the corresponding power of g\nin the case g = gq = gu . We see that mps /g(6\u2212p\u2212s)/2 indeed depend weakly on g in the\nwide interesting range.\n\n5. Results for Standard Model fermions\nNow we are ready to find the set of the parameters of the our model (Y , \u01eb, g) which\nreproduce the real SM fermionic mass pattern.\nTo do this, one has to find eigenvalues of the mass matrix mups (Yu , \u01ebu , gq , gu ), to equate\nthe result with known fermion masses, and to obtain three equations on four unknown\nvariable, Yu , \u01ebu , gq , gu . However, even to solve numerically these equations is not an easy\nproblem. The point is that to find the solution one has to obtain the mass matrix mups\nin some range of the parameters, which requires in turn the calculation of the zero modes\n(solving the Eqs. (4.4)) at each value of g. Fortunately, there is a simpler way. First of all,\nnote that the mass matrix is proportional to Yu,(d,l) , and, therefore, any ratio of the masses\ndoes not depend on Yu,(d,l) . Forming two ratios of the masses one obtains two equations on\nthree variables \u01ebu , gq , gu . The second simplification is to use the established dependence\nof the mass matrix on g and \u01eb (4.18), (4.19). After this the obtained equations can be\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\feasily solved. In fact, in the quark sector the situation is more complicated since besides\nthe mass matrix for up-quarks, there are also the mass matrix for down quarks and the\nCKM matrix. Therefore, we have seven equations (four equations for the mass ratios and\nthree equations for CKM angles) on five parameters (gq , gu , gd , \u01ebu , \u01ebd ). In our simulations\nwe have used five of seven equations to reproduce correct mass ratios and one element of\nCKM ). As a result we have obtained\nthe CKM-matrix (U33\ngq = 0.0013 * M \u22125 , gu = 0.0013 * M \u22125 , gd = 0.03 * M \u22125 , \u01ebu = 0.9, \u01ebd = 0.1.\n\n(5.1)\n\nHaving at hand these parameters, one can find two other independent elements of the\nCKM-matrix, but, in general, we could not expect that they will coincide with the known\nvalues. However, we have obtained the following CKM-matrix\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0.9780 0.2084 0.0100\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nU CKM = \uf8ed 0.2086 0.9769 0.0453 \uf8f8 ,\n(5.2)\n0.0004 0.0464 0.9990\n\nand see that this matrix coincides quite well with the measured CKM-matrix in the Standard Model [9]\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0.9742 \u00f7 0.9757 0.219 \u00f7 0.226 0.002 \u00f7 0.005\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nCKM\nUSM\n= \uf8ed 0.219 \u00f7 0.225 0.9734 \u00f7 0.9749 0.037 \u00f7 0.043 \uf8f8 .\n(5.3)\n0.004 \u00f7 0.014 0.035 \u00f7 0.043 0.9990 \u00f7 0.9993\nIn the leptonic sector the correct mass ratios are reproduced at\ngl = ge = 0.01, \u01ebl = 0.75.\n\nTo find Yukawa couplings Y we should first of all understand how the obtained dimensionful parameters (that is all parameters except \u01eb) correlate with the absolute energy\nscale. Let us assume that the first non-zero fermion level is of order 100TeV. It means that\ngv 3 \u2243 100TeV. Substituting here g = 0.001 and v = 1 one finds our units:\n1 * M = 105 TeV.\nWith this relation, one can convert all parameters measured in our units to the absolute\nmass scale:\nv = \u03bc = 1010 TeV2 , v1 = 3 * 109 TeV2\n\u03bb = \u03ba = \u03c1 = 10\u221210 TeV\u22122 , h = 1.02*10\u22125 TeV\u22121 , \u03b7 = 3.1*10\u22126 TeV\u22121 , e = 4*10\u22127 TeV\u22121\ngq = gu = 1.3 * 10\u221228 TeV\u22125 , gd = 3 * 10\u221227 TeV\u22125 , gl = ge = 1 * 10\u221227 TeV\u22125 .\nNow taking into account the actual values of the fermion masses one finds the values of\nthe Yukawa couplings Y :\nYu = 3.7 * 10\u221217 TeV\u22123 , Yd = 2.1 * 10\u221220 TeV\u22123 , Yl = 1.8 * 10\u221221 TeV\u22123 .\nIt is worth noting that we do not obtain any additional hierarchy: all dimensionless\n1/5 \u221a\ncombinations of the our parameters are of order unity. For instance, gu / \u03bb = 0.4,\n1/3 1/5\nYu /gu = 1.3, etc.\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\f6. Conclusions\nIn a class of multidimensional models with one vector-like fermionic family, the low-energy\neffective theory describes three chiral families in four dimensions. Hierarchy of fermionic\nmasses appears due to different profiles of the fermionic wave functions in extra dimensions.\nIn this paper we have investigated numerically one of the models of this kind. Namely,\nwe considered the model suggested in [2] and [3]. We have shown that hierarchical mass\npattern indeed appears in the model [3] with the gauged Ug (1) group which is responsible\nfor the forming of Abrikosov\u2013Nielsen\u2013Olesen vortex, but the dependence of the mass matrix\non the parameters is slightly different than it was presented in the Refs. [2, 3]. On the\nother hand, in the case of global Ug (1) unnatural mass pattern appears. In the gauge case\nwe found the set of the parameters of the model which reproduces well all known fermion\nmasses and mixings, without hierarchy among parameters. Moreover, in SM quark sector\nwe have reproduced the nine known values (six masses and three mixing angles) by the\nvariation of the seven parameters of the model: three couplings gu,d,q , two \u01ebu,d , and two\nYukawa couplings Yu,d .\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe are indebted to V.Rubakov, S.Troitsky, and J.-M.
