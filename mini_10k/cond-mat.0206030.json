This result, besides its importance concerning network efficiency and/or security, has the striking\nimplication that the small-world property of scale-free networks is mainly due to short-range links.\nPACS numbers: 87.23.Ge,89.20.Hh,89.75.Hc,89.75.Da\n\nMany real networks have been identified to have an amazingly small average shortest path since Watts and Strogatz\n(WS) [1] introduced their model of small-world networks.\nThis model is constructed from a sparse regular network by\nrewiring a small fraction of links at random. Watts [2] introduced the concept of range to characterize different types\nof links: the range of a link lij connecting nodes i and j is\nthe length of the shortest path between nodes i and j in the\nabsence of lij (see also Ref. [3]). In this sense, typically,\nlocal connections are short-range links but rewired connections are long-range links. A key feature in the WS model\nis that it clearly identifies the small shortest paths observed\nin locally structured, sparse networks as being due to longrange connections, while short-range links are responsible for\nhigh clustering. This remarkable observation matches very\nwell with the known results for the Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi (ER) model\nof random graphs [4], where almost all links are long-range\nconnections and the average shortest path increases only logarithmically with the number N of nodes [5]. In regular networks, on the other hand, all the links have small range and\nthe average shortest path increases with a power of N .\nThe WS and ER models explain some important features\nof real networks, such as the small-world phenomenon. However, since these models are homogeneous, their connectivity\ndistribution P (k), where k is the number of links connected\nto a node, has an exponential tail, in contrast to the algebraic\none that characterizes scale-free networks recently discovered\nin a variety of real-world situations [6, 7],\nP (k) \u223c k \u2212\u03b3 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is the scaling exponent. Scale-free networks are heterogeneous as their connectivity can vary significantly from\nnode to node and a considerable number of links can be associated with a few highly connected nodes. Barab\u00e1si and\nAlbert (BA) identified in their seminal paper [6], growth with\npreferential attachment as the universal mechanism generating the algebraic behavior (1). As most scale-free networks\npossess the small-world property, it has been tacitly assumed\nthat long-range connections are responsible for the small average shortest path exhibited by these networks. In addition\n\nto the insights provided by the WS model, the main argument\nfor this comes from the observation that the removal of a link\nlij of range R increases the length of the shortest path between nodes i and j by R \u2212 1. The length of the shortest path\nbetween nodes connected by a short-range link is then robust\nagainst the removal of the link because the second shortest\npath between these two nodes is still short. But this is not true\nfor long-range links, as they connect nodes that would otherwise be separated by a long shortest path.\nScale-free networks have attracted a tremendous amount of\nrecent interest [7]. The aim of this paper is to investigate explicitly the contribution of short-range links to the small-world\nproperty in scale-free networks by analyzing the impact of attacks on short-range links versus those on long-range links.\nAttack here is defined as the deliberate removal of a subset of\nselected links. The importance of studying attacks on complex\nnetworks is twofold. First, it can identify the vulnerabilities\nof real-world networks, which can be used either for protection (e.g., of Internet) or for destruction (e.g., of metabolic\nnetworks targeted by drugs). Second, it provides guidance in\ndesigning more robust artificial networks (e.g., power grids).\nDifferent aspects of attacks on complex networks have been\nanalyzed recently [3, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. However, to our\nbest knowledge, almost all the previous works consider attacks on nodes rather than on links, with very few exceptions\n[14, 15].\nTo study range-based attacks on links, we consider the following models of scale-free networks: (1) semirandom model\n[16]; (2) BA model [6] and its generalization with aging [17].\nIn each case, we generate scale-free networks with the smallworld property and a tunable scaling exponent. Because of the\nsmall-world property, one might intuitively think that these\nnetworks are much more sensitive to attacks on long-range\nthan on short-range links. Surprisingly, our analysis and\nnumerical computation show exactly the opposite for many\nscale-free networks. This result has an unexpected implication: short-range links are the vital ones for efficient communication between nodes in these networks. Our findings are\nbased on the observation that the average shortest path is a\nglobal quantity that is mainly determined by links with large\n\n\f2\n\nE=\n\nX 1\n2\n,\nN (N \u2212 1)\ndij\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the sum is over all N (N \u22121)/2 pairs of nodes. The network is more efficient when it has small shortest paths, which\naccording to our definition corresponds to large E. Definition (2) was introduced in Ref. [21] to generalize the concept\nof small world, as it applies to any network regardless of its\nconnectedness.\nWe first consider the semirandom model as follows. We\nstart with N nodes {1, 2, . . . , N } and a list of N integers\nrepresenting their connectivities, i.e., the number of \"halflinks\" of each node: {k1 , k2 , . . . , kN }, where ki \u2264 N \u2212 1\nPN\nand i=1 ki is even. In the case of scale-free networks, this\nconnectivity sequence is generated according to the algebraic\ndistribution (1). Next, we pick up pairs of half-links at random\nand connect them to form a link and repeat this process until\nthe last pair is connected, prohibiting self- and repeated links.\nIn order to have nontrivial networks in the limits of small and\nlarge \u03b3, we bound the connectivity so that kmin \u2264 ki \u2264 kmax\nfor i = 1, 2, . . . , N , where kmin and kmax are constant integers. For \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e, the network becomes a regular random\ngraph, which is homogeneous with all the nodes having the\nsame connectivity kmin . For \u03b3 \u2192 0, most of the links are\nassociated with nodes with connectivity of the order of kmax ,\nand the network becomes densely connected. The most interesting regime corresponds to intermediate values of \u03b3 because in this case, the network is highly heterogeneous but\nstill sparse, having the number of links much smaller than\nN (N \u2212 1)/2. Consider then this case.\nEmploying the generating function formalism of Ref. [16],\nwe have derived an approximate expression for the expected\nvalue of the shortest path between nodes with connectivity ki\nand kj ,\ndij =\n\nln(N z1 /ki kj )\n+ 1,\nln(z2 /z1 )\n\n(3)\n\n4\n\nAveraged Product\nof Connectivities\n\nload, where the load of a link is defined as the number of shortest paths passing through the link [18, 19]. For scale-free networks with exponent \u03b3 in a finite interval around 3, due to heterogeneity, the load is on average larger for links with shorter\nrange, making the short-range attack more destructive. For\nvery large values of \u03b3, the corresponding networks become\nhomogeneous and, as a result, the opposite occurs.\nFor a given network, our attack strategy is as follows. We\nfirst compute the range for all the links. We then measure the\nefficiency of the network as links are successively removed\naccording to their ranges: (i) for short-range attacks, links\nwith shorter ranges are removed first; (ii) for long-range attacks, links with longer ranges are removed first [20]. In both\ncases, the choice among links with the same range is made\nat random. The efficiency is measured by the shortest paths\nbetween pairs of nodes. The shortest path between two given\nnodes i and j is defined as the minimal number dij of links\nnecessary to follow from one node to the other. A convenient\nquantity to characterize the efficiency is then\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\nLoad\nRange\nPath\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nFIG. 1: Averaged product of connectivities as a function of the shortest path, range, and load for \u03b3 = 3, where the load is binned and\nnormalized by 104 . Each curve corresponds to the average over 10\nrealizations for N = 5000, kmin = 3, and kmax = 500.\n\nwhere z1 and z2 are the average numbers of first and second\nneighbors, respectively. Accordingly, nodes with larger connectivity are on average closer to each other than those with\nsmaller connectivity. The remarkable property of Eq. (3) is\nthat dij depends only on the product of the connectivities ki\nand kj . This relation suggests that the range is also correlated\nwith the product of the connectivities [22] so that short-range\nlinks tend to link together highly connected nodes, while longrange links tend to connect nodes with very few links. Moreover, links between nodes with large connectivities are expected to be passed through by a large number of shortest\npaths. That is, on average, these links should possess a higher\nload [15, 23] than those connected to nodes with fewer links.\nThese have been confirmed numerically, as shown in Fig. 1\nfor \u03b3 = 3, where we plot the product of connectivities averaged over all pairs of nodes separated by a given shortest path\nlength, or connected by a link with a given range or load.\nCombining the above analyses for range and load, we observe that high load should be associated mainly with shortrange links. With the understanding that links with higher load\nshould contribute more to the shortness of the paths between\nnodes, this correlation between load and range implies that attacks on short-range links are more destructive than those on\nlong-range links, in contrast to what one might naively think.\nNow we present numerical verification of our main result\nconcerning the effect of attacks on links. In Fig. 2, we\nshow the efficiency (normalized by its initial value) for both\nshort- and long-range attacks, for different values of \u03b3. Notably, short-range attacks are more destructive than long-range\nones for intermediate values of \u03b3, as shown in Figs. 2(a) and\n2(b) for \u03b3 = 3 and \u03b3 = 5, respectively. The corresponding relation between the average load and range, plotted in\nFig. 3 for \u03b3 = 3 (open circles), confirms that higher load\non links with shorter range is the mechanism underlying this\nphenomenon. Long-range attacks become more destructive\nonly for networks with sufficiently small or large values of \u03b3.\nIn Figs. 2(c) and 2(d), we show the results for \u03b3 = 2.5 and\n\u03b3 = \u221e, respectively. The exchange of the roles of attacks\non short- and long-range links for networks with small values\nof \u03b3 is due to the appearance of a densely connected subnet-\n\n\f3\n1.00\n\n1.00\n\n\u03b3=3 (a)\n\n1.00\n\n\u03b3=5 (b)\n\n1.00\n\n\u03b1=0 (a)\n\n0.99\n\n0.98\n\n0.98\n\n\u03b1=\u22122 (b)\n\n0.96\n\n0.94\n0.00\n\n0.96\n\nshort\u2212range\nlong\u2212range\n0.02\n\n1.00\n\n0.04\n\n\u03b3=2.5 (c)\n\n0.99\n\nshort\u2212range\nlong\u2212range\n\n0.00\n\n0.02\n\n1.00\n\n0.04\n\n\u03b3=\u221e (d)\n\n0.98\n\nNormalized Efficiency\n\nNormalized Efficiency\n\n0.98\n4500\n\n10000\n\n0.96\n\n0.98\n\nL\n\nL\n3000\n\n5000\n1500\n2\n\n0.94\n0.00\n\n4\n\n6\n\n0.97\n\nR\n\n0.02\n\n1.00\n\n0.04\n\n\u03b1=1 (c)\n\n2\n\n3\n\nR\n\n0.00\n\n4\n\n5\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n1.00\n\nER (d)\n\n0.99\n0.96\n4500\n\n0.98\n\n0.98\n\nshort\u2212range\nlong\u2212range\n\n0.97\n0.00\n\n0.02\n\n0.94\n0.04 0.00\n\nshort\u2212range\nlong\u2212range\n\n0.97\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n4\n\nAveraged Load\n\nx 10\n\n1\n\u03b3=3\n\u03b3=\u221e\n9\n\nRange\n\n0.00\n\n4\n\nR\n\n6\n\n8\n\n0.02\n\n0.92\n0.04 0.00\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n1/R\n\n0.4\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\nFraction of Removed Links\n\nwork of nodes with large connectivity. In this case, there are\nso many redundant short-range connections that the removal\nof one will not increase the average shortest path by much because, for a given pair of nodes, there are, in general, more\nthan one path of minimal length which pass through different\nshort-range links. For networks with large values of \u03b3, switching of the roles of short- and long-range attacks is caused by\nthe homogenization of the network. In a homogeneous network, all the nodes have approximately the same connectivity.\nTherefore, links with higher load are precisely those between\ndistant nodes, i.e., those with larger range, as shown in Fig. 3\nfor \u03b3 = \u221e (open squares).\nTo demonstrate the generality of our results, we turn next to\ndynamic models of scale-free networks, where the algebraic\nscaling results from growth with preferential attachment, as\nobserved in many realistic networks [6, 7]. For concreteness,\nwe consider the BA model [6] and its generalization with aging of nodes due to Dorogovtsev and Mendes [17].

Each\ngraph corresponds to the average over 10 realizations for: (a-c) N =\n5000, N0 = 3, and m = 3; (d) N = 5000 and z1 = 6. The\ncorresponding relations between averaged loads L and ranges R are\nplotted in the insets. Observe that in inset (d) the horizontal axis is\nR\u22121 .\n\nis constructed as follows. We start at t = 0 with N0 nodes and\nzero links. At each successive time step, we add a new node\nwith m \u2264 N0 links so that each new link is connected to some\nold node i with probability \u03a0i \u223c \u03c4i\u2212\u03b1 (ki + 1), where \u03c4i is the\nage of the node i and ki is its connectivity. The standard BA\nmodel with scaling exponent \u03b3 = 3 is recovered by taking\n\u03b1 = 0. In general, scale-free networks with \u03b3 > 2 are generated by choosing values of \u03b1 in the interval (\u2212\u221e, 1] [17],\nwhere \u03b3 approaches the value of 2 as \u03b1 \u2192 \u2212\u221e and becomes\ninfinite as \u03b1 \u2192 1.\nMost of the arguments and conclusions presented for the\nsemirandom model are also valid for the growth model. In\nparticular, the short-range attack is still expected to be more\ndestructive than the long-range one at intermediate values of\n\u03b3, while the opposite is expected for sufficiently large \u03b3. However, there is an important difference for 2 < \u03b3 < 3. Since\nnew links come with new nodes, the subnetwork of highly\nconnected nodes must be sparse. Accordingly, for this model,\nthere will be no switching concerning the effect of short- versus long-range attacks at a small value of \u03b3.\nOur predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations, as\nshown in Fig. 4 for different values of \u03b1 (\u03b3). Indeed, shortrange attacks are more destructive for \u03b1 = 0 (\u03b3 = 3) and also\nfor \u03b1 = \u22122 (\u03b3 \u2248 2.3), while long-range attacks are more\ndestructive for \u03b1 = 1 (\u03b3 = \u221e). In all cases, the best strategy\nof attack is consistent with the correlation between load and\nrange, as shown in the insets of Figs. 4(a)-4(c).\nIt is instructive to compare the results for scale-free networks with those for homogeneous networks with Poissonlike distribution of connectivities. In Fig. 4(d), we show the\n\n\f4\nefficiency for the ER random model [24]. This network is\nmore sensitive to attacks on long-range links because of the\nstrong concentration of load on links with range infinity (see\nthe inset). Incidentally, the long-range attack is also more destructive in the WS model [1], where the rewired connections\ntend to have higher load [25].\nIn summary, we have shown that for a wide interval of\nthe scaling exponent \u03b3, scale-free networks are more vulnerable to short- than long-range attacks, which results from a\nhigher concentration of load on short-range links. In contrast\nto the load-based strategies of attacks considered in Ref. [15],\nwhich are based on global information, short-range attacks are\nquasilocal in that, for a given range R, they require information only up to the (R \u2212 1)th neighbors [26]. Our findings\nhave important implications that go beyond the issue of attack\nitself, as they provide insights into the structure and dynamics\nof scale-free networks. In particular, they show that shortrange links are more important than long-range links for efficient communication between nodes, which is the opposite to\nwhat one might expect from other classes of small-world networks. For instance, in the network of sexual contacts, which\nis known to be scale-free [27], this means that the rapid spread\nof a disease may be mainly due to short-range contacts between people with large number of partners, in sharp contrast\nto its homogeneous counterpart [3].\nThis work was supported by AFOSR under Grants Nos.\nF49620-01-1-0317 and F49620-98-1-0400, and by NSF under Grant No. PHY-9996454.\n\n[1] D.J.

In addition, in terms of attack\nefficiency, updating is time consuming.\n[21] V. Latora and M. Marchiori, Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 198701 (2001).\n[22] Indeed, the range of a link can be regarded as the length of\nthe second shortest path between the nodes that are connected\nto the link. Since we are considering the semirandom model,\nfor which everything other than the connectivity distribution is\nrandom, the length of the second shortest path should also be\ncorrelated with the product of connectivities.\n[23] For pairs of nodes connected by n \u2265 1 shortest paths, the contribution to the load due to each path is 1/n.\n[24] In this model, we start with N nodes and zero links. Then for\neach pair of nodes, with probability p, we add a link between\nthem. The resulting network has on average z1 = p(N \u2212 1)\nlinks per node.\n[25] The same tendency displayed in Figs. 2 and 4 was observed for\nlarger fractions of removed links. In particular, short-range attack is still the most effective one for scale-free networks with\nscaling exponent around 3. We observe, however, that the removed fraction shown in these figures is already unrealistically\nlarge for many practical situations.\n[26] Reference [15] also considers local strategies of attack.\n[27] F.
