Though intriguing, the small-scale Xray flares are not the long sought-after \"smoking gun\" of nucleonic CR acceleration in\nSNRs.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nRecently, Uchiyama et al. (2007) reported the detection of intriguing small-scale X-ray\nflares in the supernova remnant (SNR) \"RX J1713-3946\" (a.k.a. G347.3-0.5), which is\nalso a TeV gamma-ray emitter (Aharonian et al., 2007). They contend that the variability\nof these X-ray \"hotspots\" implies that the magnetic field in the remnant is about a\nhundred times larger than normally assumed; and this, they say, means that the detected\n\n\fTeV range photons were produced in energetic nuclear interactions, providing \"a strong\nargument for acceleration of protons and nuclei to energies of 1 PeV (1015 eV) and\nbeyond in young supernova remnants.\"\n\nThe authors' main argument is that the X-ray variability of the small \"hotspot\" regions\nimplies a variability of the energetic electron population on the flare time scale (~1yr),\nwhich in turn requires a strong magnetic field, ~1mG, to allow the electrons to lose a\nsignificant fraction of the energy during this period (Uchiyama et al., 2007). For such a\nstrong magnetic field, the detected X-ray emission would be produced by a small\npopulation of electrons, which could not account for the observed TeV flux. The authors\ntherefore conclude that the TeV emission is produced by nuclei, rather than by electrons.\n\nPROBLEMS WITH THE HADRONIC INTERPRETATION\nHowever, there are two important caveats to such an interpretation. Firstly, the X-ray\nflares do not necessarily reflect variations in the electron population at all. These may\nwell be due, for instance, to a change in the intensity of the local magnetic field on time\nscales much shorter than the electron acceleration or cooling time. In fact, if the cooling\ntime and acceleration efficiency change on short time scales as suggested by Uchiyama et\nal., this would likely be accompanied (or generated by) a change in the intensity of the\nlocal magnetic field. And so in both cases changes in the magnetic field intensity on ~1yr\ntime scales are expected. Secondly, even if the authors' interpretation of a strong, ~1mG,\nmagnetic field is accepted, the inferred field value would apply only to the miniscule Xray hotspot regions. Since the TeV gamma-ray emission is present over the entire SNR\nshell (Aharonian et al., 2007), and not limited to the small hotspots, inverse-Compton\nemission by high energy electrons cannot yet be ruled out as the origin of the bulk of the\nextended TeV flux (Porter, Moskalenko & Strong 2006; Katz & Waxman, 2008).\n\nFurthermore, the strong large-scale magnetic field advocated by Uchiyama et al. for RX\nJ1713-3946 is incompatible with the very weak extended radio emission of this remnant\n(Lazendic et al., 2004). Consider the relationship between the predicted radio synchrotron\n\n\fluminosity at 1.4GHz, \u03bdL\u03bd (sync; 1.4GHz), and the TeV gamma ray pion decay\nluminosity, \u03bdL\u03bd (PP; TeV) (Katz & Waxman, 2008):\n\n\u03bdL\u03bd (sync; 1.4GHz) ~ \u03bdL\u03bd (PP; TeV) (Kep/0.01) (B/100 \u03bcG)3/2(n/ 1 cm-3) -1\nwhere B is the magnetic field, n is the target density, and the electron and proton\ndistributions are given by dNe/dE= Kep dNp/dE= KepC E-2 with Kep the electron/proton\nnumber ratio and C the normalization constant. The observed ratio of fluxes per\nlogarithmic frequency at 1.4GHz and 1 TeV, in RX J1713-3946 is \u03bdf\u03bd (1.4GHz)/\u03bdf\u03bd\n(TeV) ~0.01. Thus, if the extended magnetic field in the remnant really were as high as\nproposed (i.e. ~1mG), and if the TeV emission were generated by nucleons, this would\nlead to radio synchrotron emission that is ~1000 times brighter than has been measured\n(Figure 1).\n\nOnly by invoking far fewer high-energy electrons as compared to protons, with a number\nratio, Kep<10-6, could the strong magnetic field model of the authors be brought into line\nwith the radio observations. However, this would be highly unrealistic as such low values\nof Kep would be roughly four orders of magnitude below that found both in direct\nmeasurements of the composition of Galactic CRs, and in observations of other SNRs\n(Katz & Waxman, 2008; Vink, 2004; Ellison, Berezhko & Baring, 2000, and references\ntherein).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThus, mG-scale magnetic fields almost certainly cannot be present over the large swaths\nof the SNR shell where the TeV emission is detected. If small regions of enhanced\nmagnetic field do exist in RX J1713-3946, it is likely that they are embedded in a much\nweaker extended field (eg. Pohl, Yan and Lazarian, 2005). Consequently, the type of\nparticles generating the extended gamma-ray emission remains unconstrained. In fact, as\nrecent detailed studies indicate, there is good reason to suspect that the bulk of the TeV\nemission in this SNR is actually leptonic in origin (Porter, Moskalenko & Strong 2006;\nKatz & Waxman, 2008; Plaga, 2008).\n\n\fQuite generally, models of this remnant in which the TeV emission is generated by\nnucleons require unrealistically few accelerated electrons relative to protons\nwith Kep<10-4, and predict thermal X-ray Bremsstrahlung emission which is much\nbrighter than the observed X-ray flux (Katz & Waxman, 2008). The latter problem in\nsuch models arises independently of the accelerated electron population or magnetic field\nvalue adopted.\n\nHopefully, the debate regarding the nature of the particles responsible for the TeV\nemission of RX J1713-3946 will be resolved with additional GeV-range gamma-ray data,\ne.g., from the Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST) satellite which is\nscheduled to be launched in 2008. These data will cover a critical energy range and will\nhelp discriminate between the leptonic or nucleonic origins of the gamma-ray photons\n(Funk et al., 2007).\n\nREFERENCES\nAharonian, F. et al., 2007, A&A 464, 235\u2013243\nBerezhko, E.
