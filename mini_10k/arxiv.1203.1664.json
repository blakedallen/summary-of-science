They are particularly\nuseful for observing changes in the stellar populations as a\nfunction of galaxy size, velocity dispersion or mass and allow\nus to test the conventional view that ETGs are composed of\nold populations which formed in a single burst of star formation some 12 \u2013 16 Gyr (Baade 1958; Tinsley & Gunn 1976;\nBruzual A. 1983; Hamilton 1985). The Faber-Jackson rela\u22c6\n\nEmail: rcwh@astro.ox.ac.uk\n\ntion (FJR, Faber & Jackson 1976) relates the central stellar\nvelocity dispersion (\u03c3) to the absolute magnitude or luminosity of a galaxy,\nM = \u03b1FJR log\u03c3 + \u03b2FJR .\n\n(1)\n\nLikewise, the Kormendy relation (KR, Kormendy 1977;\nHamabe & Kormendy 1987) relates the effective radius (Re )\nto the surface brightness of the galaxy (\u03bce ),\nh\u03bcie = \u03b1KR logRe + \u03b2KR .\n\n(2)\n\nThe original Kormendy relation was defined between the\nsurface brightness at Re and Re itself. It is now conventional\nto use the average surface brightness within Re against Re .\n\n\f2\n\nR. C. W. Houghton, Roger L. Davies, E. Dalla Bont\u00e0, R. Masters\n\nFor a de Vaucouleurs light profile (de Vaucouleurs 1953),\nthese are related by a constant factor, but for a S\u00e9rsic profile\n(S\u00e9rsic 1963) this is not the case and the conversion depends\non the S\u00e9rsic index n.\nBoth the FJR and the KR are projections of the\nFundamental plane of ETGs (FP: Dressler et al. 1987;\nDjorgovski & Davis 1987), linking Re , \u03c3 and h\u03bce i (sometimes expressed in L\u2299 pc\u22122 as hIie ).\nlogRe = \u03b1FP log\u03c3 + \u03b2FP h\u03bcie + \u03b3FP\n\n(3)\n\nThe FP is tilted compared to the Virial Theorem prediction\nwhich is thought to be caused by a variation in mass-tolight (M/L) with mass (Faber et al. 1987; Renzini & Ciotti\n1993).\nThe colour-magnitude relation (CMR, Sandage 1972)\nis a tight relation between the (red) colour of ETGs and\ntheir magnitude (or luminosity). Defining generic variables\nmb and mr for the magnitudes in the blue and red filters\nrespectively,\nmb \u2212 mr = \u03b1CMR Mr + \u03b2CMR .\n\n(4)\n\nwhere M refers to the absolute magnitude.\n1.1\n\n1.2\n\nEvolution in slope and intercept of scaling\nrelations\n\nStudying scaling relations at earlier cosmic times allows us\nto study the evolution of the stellar populations. Under the\nassumption that all galaxies evolve uniformly in brightness\nfrom the changes in stellar populations, one should observe\na change in the zeropoint, \u03b2. For the FJR, the non-local\nrelation becomes\nMz = \u03b1FJR log\u03c3z + \u03b2FJR + \u2206\u03b2FJR .\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Mz and \u03c3z are the non-local measurements and\n\u2206\u03b2FJR represents the difference in luminosity from the local\nsample. Similarly for the KR,\nh\u03bcie,z = \u03b1KR logRe,z + \u03b2KR + \u2206\u03b2KR .\n\nrather than age (in that respect, the cluster ETGs were\nfound to be coeval and old).\nRecently there has been debate over the observation of\ndownsizing (Cowie et al. 1996; Thomas et al. 2005) and the\nrole of selection effects: the study of Holden et al. (2010)\nat z \u223c 0.8 found no evidence that the tilt of the highz FP changes from its local value, which implies that the\nfindings of J\u00f8rgensen et al. (2006), Fritz et al. (2009) and\nSaglia et al. (2010) are biased by selection effects.\nWe emphasise the importance of updating local scaling\nrelations with the latest technology, techniques and cosmology in relation to observations at higher redshift \u2013 the vast\nmajority of KR, FJR and FP studies compare high redshift\nobservations to the 15 yr old Gunn r-band observations of\nJ\u00f8rgensen et al. (1996) and observations in different bands\nare even older (see the review by D'Onofrio et al. 2006). Although potentially a good reference, the SDSS FP parameters (Bernardi et al. 2003) have not been used due to their\ndisparity with other work.\n\n(6)\n\nStudies of the KR at intermediate redshift show changes\nin \u2206\u03b2KR consistent with ETGs becoming more luminous\nwith lookback time and the slope generally appears\nto be unchanged (Barrientos et al. 1996; Pahre et al.\n1996; Schade et al. 1996, 1997; Ziegler et al. 1999;\nLa Barbera et al. 2003; Fritz et al. 2005; Holden et al.\n2005). Similar conclusions are drawn from the evolution\nof the FJR (Bender et al. 1996; Ziegler et al. 2001, 2005;\nFritz et al. 2005) and the FP (van Dokkum & Franx 1996a;\nvan Dokkum et al. 1998; Treu et al. 2001; Kelson et al.\n2000; van Dokkum et al. 2001; van Dokkum & Ellis 2003;\nFritz et al. 2005; Holden et al. 2005; van der Wel et al.\n2005;\nMoran et al.\n2005;\nJ\u00f8rgensen et al.\n2006;\nBarr et al. 2006; van Dokkum & van der Marel 2007;\nvan der Wel et al. 2006; van der Marel & van Dokkum\n2007; Fritz et al. 2009; Holden et al. 2010; Saglia et al.\n2010).\nAn important use of scaling relations was demonstrated by Kodama & Arimoto (1997) who broke the age\u2013\nmetallicity degeneracy (Worthey 1994) by showing that the\nCMR slope is the same in clusters at z \u223c 0.2\u20130.4 and must\noriginate from a variation in metallicity with luminosity,\n\nScatter in the CMR\n\nBower et al. (1992, hereafter BLE92) first used the U-V\nColour\u2013Magnitude Diagram (CMD) of the Coma cluster to\nplace constraints on the star formation histories (SFHs) of\nthe galaxies. They estimated the scatter in the red sequence\n(RS) of the Coma CMD to be \u223c0.04 mag, which can then\nbe used to infer that either: a) all the galaxies in Coma\nformed at high redshift (z>2) but randomly over the preceding interval, or b) the galaxies in Coma formed more\nrecently but were highly coeval, thus demonstrating a remarkable degree of synchronisation. Given that if all the\ngalaxies formed at z\u223c1, the star formation would have been\napparent with moderately deep surveys and had not been\nobserved, the authors concluded that the ETGs in Coma\nformed at z>2 with little synchronisation in the SFHs.\nBy considering the effects of more complex stellar populations (CSPs), Bower et al. (1998, hereafter BKT98) confirmed the original conclusion of BLE92. They also investigated the effects of merging on the RS and found that the\nsmall scatter of the CMR requires that the cluster galaxies\nformed in mass sub-units not much smaller than half their\npresent day mass.\nStanford et al.\n(1995),\nEllis et al.\n(1997),\nStanford et al. (1998) and Mei et al. (2009), have studied\nmany clusters with z <\n\u223c 1.3 to address evolution of the\nCMR scatter. They all found remarkably constant scatter,\ngenerally consistent with that of Coma with values < 0.1\nmag. This implies that the bulk of the stars in these\ncluster ETGs are very old and formed at z > 2 with\nlittle synchronisation in the SFHs, although Stanford et al.\nand Mei et al. highlight the possibility of progenitor bias.\nMei et al. also found evidence that the scatter is less\nfor more luminous galaxies, suggesting more massive\ngalaxies are slightly older (by \u223c 0.5 Gyr). We note that\nStanford et al. (1998) discuss a gap in the estimates of the\nCMR scatter between 0.1 < z < 0.3 which, together with\ntheir slightly higher CMR scatter at z > 0.3, led them to\nsuggest possible evolution of the CMR scatter during this\nepoch.\n\n\fData and 2D scaling relations for galaxies in Abell 1689: a hint of size evolution at z\u223c0.2\n1.3\n\nThis study\n\nThe evolution of the KR, FJR, FP and CMR appears to\nbe consistent with passive fading of the stellar population\nfrom a single burst of star formation at z > 1. Similarly, the\ncurrent evidence from analysis of the CMR is also greatly\nin favour of the simple passive fading of ETGs. However, simultaneous study of multiple scaling relations is rarely performed and it is unclear if they are all quantitatively consistent. Furthermore, it is important to account for magnitude\ncuts and selection effects given the results of Holden et al.\n(2010).\nIn this paper we present data and analysis techniques\nfor the cluster Abell 1689. We compare the 2D scaling relations (CMR, KR and FJR) for Abell 1689 to those of\nthe local cluster Coma, accounting for magnitude cuts and\nselection effects, and specifically testing for consistency:\nif the evolution of different scaling relations is governed\nsolely by luminosity evolution of the stellar populations,\nthey should all agree. Note that we will present the FP of\nAbell 1689 in a future paper. Abell 1689 is a massive cluster\nat z=0.183 (Struble & Rood 1999) with an X-ray luminosity of 20.74\u00d71044 erg s\u22121 (Ebeling et al. 1996) making it one\nof the most X-ray luminous galaxy clusters known (the Xray luminosity for Coma is 7.21\u00d71044 erg s\u22121 , Ebeling et al.\n1996). The KR, FJR, FP and CMR have not been previously\nstudied in regard to the passive fading of ETGs despite it\nbeing one of the main targets for HST lensing surveys. We\npresent colours and magnitudes for 531 galaxies, as well as\nspectroscopic data for 71 galaxies and surface photometry\nfor 43 galaxies with which we investigate the CMR, KR and\nFJR.\nThroughout this work, we adopt a WMAP7 Cosmology\n(Komatsu et al. 2011); specifically, we use H0 = 71km s\u22121\nMpc\u22121 , \u03a9m = 0.27 and \u03a9\u039b = 0.73. All quoted uncertainties\nare standard (1\u03c3, 68%) unless otherwise stated. The structure of this paper is as follows. In \u00a72 we discuss the data\nreduction of the GMOS imaging, GMOS spectra and HST\nimaging as well as the data analysis techniques for the photometry and the kinematics and end with a discussion of\nhow we fit the 2D scaling relations. Then in \u00a73 we present\nour results and discuss the use of stellar population models to interpret them in \u00a74. In \u00a75 we present the discussion\nand conclude in \u00a76. We also present Appendices regarding\nthe data reduction and analysis: Appendix A discusses our\ncurve-of-growth (COG) technique and the associated error\nanalysis; Appendix B discusses how we matched the spectral\nprofile of the stellar library to that of the GMOS-N instrument, and Appendix C presents the techniques used to fit\nand compare the scaling relations of Abell 1689.\n\n2\n\nDATA REDUCTION AND ANALYSIS\n\nWe now describe the reduction and analysis techniques used\nto measure integrated photometry (from GMOS-N g G0301\nand r G0303 imaging, hereafter referred to as g\u2032 and r\u2032 ),\nsurface photometry (from HST/ACS F625W imaging), and\nkinematics (from GMOS-N MOS).\n\n2.1\n\n3\n\nGEMINI/GMOS imaging\n\nDetails of the seeing limited images of Abell 1689 are given\nin Table 1. The g\u2032 -band images have a plate scale of 0.\u2032\u2032 1454\nper pixel (2x2 binning) while the r\u2032 -band images have a plate\nscale of 0.\u2032\u2032 0727 (no binning). The reduction of the GMOS\nimaging was based on that of J\u00f8rgensen et al. (2005) and\nBarr et al. (2005) but with a few differences. We use custom\nmodified versions of the Gemini IRAF data reduction software (v1.14) and for completeness, we outline our method\nbelow.\n\n2.1.1\n\nPreliminary stages: bias subtraction, mosaicing and\ninterpolation\n\nWe first processed the GMOS CCD images by performing\nthe bias subtraction using the overscan region. A flat field\nimage was created using a series of scaled twilight exposures\n(of differing exposure times) which was then applied to the\nAbell 1689 images. The individual chips were mosaiced onto\na single image using 'nearest' interpolation to avoid correlating pixels (the error in nearest interpolation is at most\nhalf the pixel size which in this case is less than 10% of the\nseeing width, see also \u00a72.5). All these processing s.ps were\nperformed with gireduce, which makes use of gprepare.\n\n2.1.2\n\nScattered light removal\n\nBefore mosaicing the images with gmosaic and subtracting the residual scattered light, the background (sky and\nscattered light) levels on each chip were estimated (using\nthe modal value) and equalised (individual chip levels subtracted, mean level added). However, both the g\u2032 - and r\u2032 band images show a non-uniform scattered light pattern\nacross the three CCD chips.\nWe produced a stacked scattered light frame following\nthe recipe described in J\u00f8rgensen et al. (2005), but to prevent removal of the intra-cluster light (ICL) a 4th order polynomial surface was fit to the frame, one chip at a time, to\nprovide a smooth representation of the scattered light while\nleaving the ICL present. As in J\u00f8rgensen et al. (2005), we\nscaled the scattered light frame (a polynomial surface in our\ncase) by between 0.8 and 1.2 (in 0.05 intervals) and determined the best subtraction by eye for each frame.\nThe scattered light corrected frames were then aligned,\nscaled and combined using a modified version of the imcoadd routine (allowing multiple pointings to be combined\ninto a single mosaic). The default intensity scaling of individual images by imcoadd (given by the header keyword\nRELINT) was found to be unreliable; instead, we fitted a\nMoffat function to a star present in the overlapping pointings of all images, and used the flux within 3 FWHM to\nscale each of the images to a common standard.\n\n2.1.3\n\nFlux calibration\n\nFlux calibration of the g\u2032 -band images followed the prescription in J\u00f8rgensen (2009) and final zeropoints are listed\nin Table 2. We used standards from Landolt (1992) or\nLandolt & Uomoto (2007) to estimate the zero points (ZP)\nfor each night.\n\n\f4\n\nR. C. W. Houghton, Roger L. Davies, E. Dalla Bont\u00e0, R. Masters\n\nFigure 1. A negative image of the galaxy cluster Abell 1689 observed using the g\u2032 - and r\u2032 -band filters with the GEMINI/GMOS imager.\nThe g\u2032 -band image has been degraded to match the resolution of the r\u2032 -band image. Overlaid is the HST footprint (solid black square)\nand the ROSAT X-ray map (grey, solid lines; contours were shifted by {-0.008,-0.006} degrees in {RA,DEC} to align with the cluster\ncore). Coloured squares mark the galaxies in the spectroscopic sample, apart from #119, #793, #1129 which are guiding/alignment\nstars. Note that #160, #457, #892, #932, #983 and #1051 are not in the cluster potential according to their recession velocities (see\nTable 6).\n\n\fData and 2D scaling relations for galaxies in Abell 1689: a hint of size evolution at z\u223c0.2\n\nFigure 2. The GMOS-N filters transmission curves (g\u2032 , r\u2032 ) together with the HST/ACS F625W transmission curve are shown\ntogether with a galaxy template spectrum (Santos et al. 2001)\nwhich has been redshifted to z=0.183. Also shown for comparison\nis a standard Johnson V-band filter curve (Bessell 1990, photographic, from) in the rest frame of the galaxy spectrum.\n\nThe g\u2032 -data was all taken during photometric conditions and with good seeing (\u223c 0.\u2032\u2032 6 in the combined image);\nconsequently, the images required little relative scaling. The\nphotometric standard was taken minutes after the last exposure, minimising systematic error from atmospheric changes.\nWe scaled all images to the last image of the night, which\nwas nearest in time to the observation of the photometric\nstandard and also had one of the highest relative throughputs of all the images (see Table 2).\nThe r\u2032 -band data were taken over two consecutive\nnights, the first of which was not photometric while the\nsecond was. From the relative throughput of the images,\nit is clear that the flux in the photometric images of the\nsecond night varies only by a few percent compared to the\nnon-photometric images of the first night, and we scaled all\nimages to the brightest photometric image of the second\nnight (with airmass <1.2) and flux calibrated the images\nusing an average of the ZPs derived from all standards. We\nalso scaled the science images to correct for airmass (according to J\u00f8rgensen 2009). The ZPs in Table 2 do not include a\nterm for the extinction from the Galaxy. For the coordinates\nof Abell 1689, Ag = 0.106 and Ar = 0.075 (Schlegel et al.\n1998; Cardelli et al. 1989): these corrections are applied to\nall integrated (\u00a72.3) and surface photometry (\u00a72.3.1) measurements.\n2.2\n\nHST imaging\n\nWe used HST/ACS images of Abell 1689 obtained with the\nWide Field Channel (WFC) as part of the ACS Guaranteed Time Observation program 9289 (P.I. H. Ford). The\nWFC detector consists of two 4096 \u00d7 2048 SITe CCDs butted together along their long dimension and separated by a\ngap corresponding to approximately 50 pixels (2.5 arcsec).\nThe plate scale is 0.050 arcsec pixel\u22121 . Each chip uses two\namplifiers to read a single 2048 \u00d7 2048 quadrant. We downloaded from the public HST archive the images employing\nthe F625W filter, which resembles the SDSS/GMOS r \u2032 filter\n\n5\n\n(see Fig. 2). The observations were carried out on 14 June\n2002 and consist of eight exposures (four pointings split in\ntwo to deal with cosmic rays) for a total integration time\nof 9500 sec. The dithered images were able to cover the gap\nbetween the adjacent chips.\nAll images were calibrated using the standard reduction\npipeline PYRAF/CALACS maintained by the Space Telescope Science Institute. Reduction steps include bias subtraction, dark current subtraction, and flat fielding, as described in detail in the ACS instrument (Maybhate A., et al.\n2010) and data (Pavlovsky C., et al. 2004) handbooks.\nWe used PYRAF task MULTIDRIZZLE together with\nstandard tasks in IRAF1 to combine all exposures into\na single geometrically corrected image while rejecting cosmic rays. We let MULTIDRIZZLE generate the inversevariance weighting map automatically, which is suitable for\nSExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996). We analyzed the\nimages obtained with different kernels by comparing the\npoint spread function (PSF) FWHM derived fitting a twodimensional Gaussian to a few stars distributed in the field\nof view. We chose to use the square drizzle kernel. In addition, for the photometric analysis we need a well sampled\nPSF. The most suitable values for scale and pixfrac were\nfound to be 0.030 arcsec pixel\u22121 and 1.0, respectively. Prior\nto MULTIDRIZZLE, we processed every flat-fielded image\nby fitting a sky level in each quadrant separately, as suggested by Sirianni et al. (2005), because of residual differences after the bias subtraction.\nThe final, combined, and geometrically corrected image\nhas a size of 7062 \u00d7 7251 pixel2 , with 0.030 arcsec pixel\u22121 .\nThe resulting field of view is approximately 212\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 218\u2032\u2032 in\nthe shape of a rhomboid.\nThe transformation to the AB photometric system follows Sirianni et al. (2005). We adopted the photometric keywords tabulated in the header of the images, as suggested\nby Pavlovsky C., et al. (2004) to ensure up-to-date values\nbased on the throughput curves of all HST optical components:\nrAB = \u22122.5 logf (F625W) + 25.9186,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere f (F625W) refers to the integrated flux in units of\nelectrons per second.\nWe produced a suitable PSF for each sample galaxy included in the HST image. The aim is to obtain realistic PSFs\nthat underwent the same reduction-steps we performed on\nthe observed images. The method is similar to the one\nadopted by Chiboucas et al. (2009). For each galaxy we derived from the flat-fielded images the coordinates in pixel of\nits centre. By using the TINYTIM package (Krist & Hook\n1999) we produced PSFs corresponding to all the exposures.\nWe created TINYTIM PSFs with a diameter of 3 arcsec.\nThe PSFs were added to synthetic images equal to the flatfielded ones, but with pixel values set to zero. These were\nthen combined, aligned, and corrected for geometric distortion in the same way as the real images. Finally, we extracted\n\n1\n\nIRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories which are operated by the Association of Universities\nfor Research in Astronomy (AURA) under cooperative agreement\nwith the National Science Foundation.\n\n\fR.

The GEMINI/GMOS imaging standards used to calibrate the photometry used here. Note that the g\u2032 -band standards were\nobserved straight after the science observations, while the r\u2032 -band standards were observed some hours before hand (see Table 1).\nZero points (ZP) were calculated according to the prescription of J\u00f8rgensen (2009). Magnitudes for the photometric standards (mstd )\nwere calculated using the f(B, B \u2212 V ) transformation in Smith et al. (2002) and the data from either Landolt (suffix a, 1992) or\nLandolt & Uomoto (suffix b, 2007); magnitudes for these standards calculated by J\u00f8rgensen (2009) are also given (suffix c). The average\nZP from the above standards for the g\u2032 -band data is 27.85\u00b10.03 while the average ZP for the r\u2032 -band is 27.99\u00b10.07.\n\nthe PSF from the processed image, with a pixel scale of 0.03\narcsec pixel\u22121 .\n\n2.3\n\nIntegrated Photometry\n\nWe used SExtractor on the GMOS g\u2032 - and r\u2032 -band images\nto calculate the integrated magnitudes in those filters. We\nselected galaxies using the g\u2032 image (it has better seeing\nthan the r\u2032 image, see Table 1) to be above a threshold of 3\ntimes the sky noise and have a minimum area of 8 pixels. A\ntotal of 64 de-blending sub-thresholds were permitted with\na minimum contrast of 1 \u00d7 10\u22124 . No filter was applied for\ndetection.\n\nWhen running SExtractor in dual image mode, the\nimages must be identically aligned, scaled, sampled and PSF\nconvolved. We re-binned and aligned the r\u2032 -band image to\nmatch the g\u2032 -band image and degraded the g\u2032 -band resolution to that of the r\u2032 -band by convolving with a Gaussian\n(FWHM=0.\u2032\u2032 8772 ). A pseudo-colour image of Abell 1689 using the g\u2032 - and r\u2032 -band images is presented in Fig. 1.\nWe extract total (MAG AUTO: based on the Kron definition) and fixed circular aperture magnitudes (MAG AP:\ndiameter of 2.\u2032\u2032 9) for all detected objects. This aperture size\n2\n\nThis number is found by trial and error to give similar Gaussian\nfits to both the g\u2032 - and r\u2032 -band images.\n\n\fData and 2D scaling relations for galaxies in Abell 1689: a hint of size evolution at z\u223c0.2\nwas chosen because it is approximately three times the Gaussian FWHM of the seeing disc in the r\u2032 image and exactly\n20 pixels. From the aperture magnitudes in g\u2032 and r\u2032 , we\ncalculate the g\u2032 -r\u2032 colour of the galaxies.\nThe errors produced by SExtractor when using just\nthe input science images appeared to be underestimated.\nInstead, when provided with a variance image to act as a\nweight map (produced by the GMOS pipeline with stars\nmasked), SExtractor produced more realistic errors, used\nhere.\nWe present the colour-magnitude diagram in Fig. 3: the\nr\u2032 magnitude represents the total (Kron) magnitude while\nthe g\u2032 -r\u2032 colour is derived from the aperture magnitudes.\nTo use only reliable photometry of galaxies, we select data\nwhere: the errors on magnitudes are less than 0.1 mag; total\nmagnitudes are brighter than 25 mag in g\u2032 and r\u2032 ; SExtractor has not flagged the photometry for any reason3 ); the\nobject was not identified as a star (class star < 0.99) and\nthe object has a FWHM> 4 pixels. Note that the error ellipses neglect the correlation between the r\u2032 -band aperture\nand total magnitudes. This data is further presented in \u00a73.1\nand discussed in \u00a75.1. We show the constraints for spectroscopic sample selection as dotted lines, which are discussed\nin \u00a72.5.\n2.3.1\n\nIn a future paper we will compare these results with full\nsurface fitting and decomposition methods. We developed\nour own curve-of-growth (COG) software (written in IDL)\nand implemented this software on the HST/ACS F625W\nimage for the spectroscopic sample. This limited the final\nsample which could enter our analysis: we observed a total\nof 77 galaxies in the spectroscopic sample and while all these\ngalaxies have ground-based g\u2032 - and r\u2032 -band imaging (\u00a72.1),\nthe HST image covers only 43 of the original 77 galaxies.\nDetails of the COG algorithm (including masking of\nnearby sources, correction of PSF effects) are given in Appendix A. We use Monte-Carlo simulations of the fitting procedure, to estimate the random and systematic uncertainties\nin logRe and logIe . These simulations include photon shot\nnoise, typical systematic errors in the subtracted sky level\nand a suitable range of radii over which we fit model COGs\n(see Appendix A). We calculate the covariance terms for use\nwhen fitting the scaling relations (see \u00a72.9) and plotting error ellipses in \u00a73. Both the de Vaucouleurs and S\u00e9rsic COG\nsurface photometry are given in Table 4; h\u03bcie has been corrected for cosmological dimming and logRe is given in kpc\n(assuming the cosmology described in \u00a71).\n\nSurface Photometry\n\nThere are two common approaches to calculating the effective radius re and the average surface brightness within\nre , h\u03bcie from the flux calibrated images: curve-of-growth\nfitting (COG, e.g. Dressler et al. 1987; J\u00f8rgensen et al.\n1992) and differential surface fitting (e.g. GASP2D\nM\u00e9ndez-Abreu et al. 2008). The COG technique was originally used to parameterise the scale and brightness of galaxies, assuming a de Vaucouleurs like profile for all galaxies,\nwhere the surface brightness I(R) is defined to be\n\u0010\n\u0011\nI(R) = I0 exp \u22127.676[R/Re ]1/4 .\n(8)\n\nHowever, more recently the differential fitting technique has been more widely used in the literature (e.g.\nvan Dokkum & Franx 1996b); furthermore it has become\ncommon to fit the more general S\u00e9rsic model (for which the\nde Vaucouleurs profile is a special case), defined as\n\u0011\n\u0010\nI(R) = I0 exp \u2212b[R/Re ]1/n .\n(9)\n\nwhere b \u2248 2n \u2212 0.324 over the range 2 < n < 10\n(Ciotti 1991). Recall also that the intensity at Re is Ie =\nI0 exp(\u2212b) and the average intensity within Re is hIie =\nIe exp(b)\u0393(2n)nb\u22122n where \u0393 is the gamma function.\nWe chose to use the older COG technique for consistency with the majority of earlier work on scaling relations\nand fit both de Vaucouleurs and S\u00e9rsic profiles, for which\nthe integrated luminosity increases with projected radius as\nL(R) = I0 Re2\n\n2\u03c0n\n\u03b3[b(R/Re )1/n , 2n]\nb2n\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is the incomplete gamma function (Ciotti 1991).\n3\n\n7\n\nother than flags 1 and 2 which inform if the photometry was\nbiased by nearby bright objects or originally blended with a neighbour, respectively.\n\n2.4\n\nPhotometric accuracy\n\nWe perform a number of cross-checks to ensure the accuracy\nof our photometry. The results of these checks are discussed\nbelow and when (internally) comparing the derived magnitudes of the galaxies we quote the mean difference and the\nRMS scatter in the relation.\nWe check the GMOS r\u2032 -band ZP in two ways: firstly\nwe compare the magnitude of an unsaturated star in our\nfield (RA=13:11:33.5, DEC=-01:20:44.7) to the same stars\nobserved with SDSS; we measure an r\u2032 magnitude of 17.12\nwhile SDSS quotes an r \u2032 magnitude of 17.150 \u00b1 0.005 (unfortunately the same star is saturated in the g\u2032 -band due to\nbetter seeing).\nWe also check how consistent the de Vaucouleurs and\nS\u00e9rsic COG magnitudes are: a direct comparison in the HST\nF625W image indicated that the S\u00e9rsic magnitudes were\n0.06 mag fainter than the de Vaucouleurs magnitudes (with\n0.2 mag scatter; the median difference was also 0.06 mag).\nFinally we compare the GMOS r\u2032 SExtractor magnitudes to the HST r\u2032 COG magnitudes: we find the SExtractor Kron magnitudes are fainter than the de Vaucouleurs\nmagnitudes by 0.12 mag (with 0.20 mag scatter and median\nof 0.17 mag) and fainter than the S\u00e9rsic magnitudes by 0.08\nmag (with 0.22 mag scatter and median of 0.13 mag). We\nestimate that the HST F625W and GMOS r\u2032 images are\ncalibrated to better than 0.1 mag (the scatter in the r\u2032 zeropoints in Table 2 is 0.07 mag). We believe the remaining\ndifference is because SExtractor (Kron) magnitudes are\nnot extrapolated to infinity. In principle, we could generate simulations to test this, but feel it is not central to our\nanalysis because any uncertainty in the GMOS r\u2032 calibration\nhas little bearing on the results, as we use the scatter in the\nCMR derived from the GMOS r\u2032 SExtractor catalogue,\nwhich is independent of the zeropoint.\n\n\f8\n\nR.

ID is the identification from SExtractor (which\nwe find no need to quote other than in this table), while the Spec. ID is the ID in the spectroscopic sample (which is quoted in this\npaper when referring to a galaxy or star). R.A. and DEC. are given in degrees and are calculated from the g\u2032 GMOS image coordinates.\nThe Red Seq. column informs us if the object is more likely to be in the red sequence (Y=yes) than not (N=No; i.e. it is more likely\nto be in the outlier distribution) using the results of the mixture model (see \u00a72.9, \u00a73.1 & \u00a7C). The apparent r\u2032 magnitudes and the\ng\u2032 -r\u2032 colours have been corrected for extinction (atmospheric and Galactic). We refer the reader to the SExtractor manual for further\ninformation on the flag codes (v.2.13, \u00a79.1, p28). Note that the g\u2032 -r\u2032 colour is an aperture magnitude while the r\u2032 magnitude is a Kron\n(total) magnitude. Note also that galaxy #655 does not meet the criterion specified in \u00a72.3, but we include it here for completeness (it\nis included in the KR and FJR).

The spectra of 77 galaxies in Abell 1689\nand 3 guide/alignment stars were taken with GMOS-N between 10th January 2002 and 15th January 2002 using\nthe B600 G5303 grating and 0.\u2032\u2032 75 slits, giving a resolution\nR \u2248 1700 (\u03c3 \u2248 75km s\u22121 ) and a (observer-frame) wavelength range of approximately 3500\u00c5 to 7000\u00c5, depending\non the position in the field of view (FOV). The spectroscopic sample is bluer than g \u2032 \u2212 r \u2032 = 1.1 mag, redder than\ng \u2032 \u2212 r \u2032 = \u22120.17r \u2032 + 3.4 mag and 50% complete to r \u2032 = 19.5\nmag (see \u00a7C2). Of the total number of galaxies matching\nthese limits, around 50% are in the spectroscopic sample\n(but note that as a function of magnitude, we are consistent\nwith sampling 60% of each magnitude bin, see \u00a7C2). The locations of the galaxies are shown in Fig. 1 while the selection\ncriteria are shown on Fig. 3. The inset histogram in Fig. 1\ncompares the distribution of the parent sample to the total\nspectroscopic sample and the spectroscopic sample that is\nlimited to the HST footprint: the total spectroscopic sample\nis a good representation of the parent sample, while the sample that lies in the HST footprint is slightly biased towards\nmore luminous galaxies. Note that an apparent magnitude\nlimit of r\u2032 < 19.5 mag is equivalent to a rest frame absolute\nmagnitude limit of MV < \u221220.04 mag.\nFour masks were used when observing the cluster and\nfor each mask, the data were observed with two different\n\ncentral wavelengths (565 nm and 570 nm) so that the two\nchip gaps did not cause discontinuity in the data. The number of exposures for each mask varies and details are given\nin Table 5. Our reduction of the spectra is initially very\nsimilar to that of the imaging (\u00a72.1) but differs in extraction. We again follow the ideas in J\u00f8rgensen et al. (2005)\nand Barr et al. (2005) but with a few differences: we use\ncustom modified versions of the Gemini IRAF data reduction software (v1.14) and for completeness, we outline our\nmethod below.\nWe process the CCD images in the usual manner, performing bias subtraction using the overscan region and flat\nfield as normal. The individual chips were mosaiced onto\na single image using 'nearest' interpolation, which retains\nthe statistical independence of the pixels. This has no effect\non the final result, as GMOS samples the spectral and spatial PSFs better than the Nyquist limit, by a factor of \u223c 5;\nin practice the positioning of our data is accurate to 10% of\nthe PSF FWHM. These processing s.ps were performed with\ngsreduce, which itself makes use of gprepare, gireduce,\ngmosaic and gscut. Furthermore, a cosmic ray rejection\nstep is present in gsreduce.\nMost of the slits were cut at an angle so it was necessary to rectify the spectra to a uniform space and wavelength grid. This was performed with gswavelength using\na 4th-order (Legendre) polynomial fit along \u03bb and a 2ndorder polynomial fit along the spatial axis. Residuals were\ntypically less than 0.2 \u00c5. The absolute zero point of the\nwavelength calibration required correction which was ac-\n\n\fData and 2D scaling relations for galaxies in Abell 1689: a hint of size evolution at z\u223c0.2\n\n9\n\nFigure 3. The Colour-Magnitude diagram for Abell 1689 created using the GEMINI/GMOS photometry with SExtractor: only data\nwith errors less than 0.1 mag are shown. The spectroscopic galaxy sample is highlighted with coloured squares while coloured diamonds\nrepresent stars. In the legend, labels followed by a star in parenthesis are guiding/alignment stars (#119, #793, #1129); of the other\ndiamonds, #972 is reported by SExtractor to be contaminated (the galaxy is peculiar and appears in the g-band image to have two\nparts) while #655 is reported by SExtractor to be a star but its spectrum confirms it to be a galaxy (as does the HST photometry). The\ncomplete sample is shown by plotting the error ellipses (often too small to distinguish from a dot). Selection limits for the spectroscopic\nsample (\u00a72.5) are shown as dotted lines (r\u2032 = 19.5 mag represents 50% completeness) and the inset histogram shows the distribution of\nall objects brighter than r\u2032 < 20 for the parent sample (black), for the spectroscopic sample (red) and for the spectroscopic sample inside\nthe HST footprint (green).\n\ncomplished using the [OI] (5577.34 \u00c5) and NaD (5889.95\n\u00c5, 5895.92 \u00c5) sky lines. Our data were reduced to a log-\u03bb\ngrid with only one interpolation to help retain the statistical\nindependence of the pixels and minimise correlations.\nThe sky was removed using gsskysub and a 1D galaxy\nspectrum extracted using an aperture of diameter 1.\u2032\u2032 4 (4.3\nkpc at z=0.183) tracing the peak flux of the galaxy spectrum. Individual 1D spectra from each exposure were combined by scaling by the median, rejecting bad pixels (including the chip gaps) and clipping the data at \u00b15\u03c3 to remove\nbad pixels or cosmics that escaped earlier detection.\n\n2.6\n\nKinematics\n\nTo extract the kinematics from the spectra, we assume that\nthe galaxy spectrum G (sampled in log\u03bb) is the convolution\n\nof a stellar template T with a distribution of stellar velocities\nL(v),\nG(log\u03bb) = T (log\u03bb) \u2297 L(v).\n\n(11)\n\nFurthermore, we assume that L(v) takes the parameterised\nform of a Gaussian with velocity V and velocity dispersion\n\u03c3.\nIn order for Eq. 11 to be valid, the stellar template population must match the galaxy population and both should\nhave the same spectral resolution (i.e. they should both appear to have been observed with the same instrument). In\npractice, this is achieved by taking a large stellar library\n(such as the Indo-U.S. Library of Coud\u00e9 Feed Stellar Spectra (CFLIB) used here, Valdes et al. 2004) observed at high\nspectral resolution and degrading it (via convolution) to\nmatch the spectral line profile of the instrument; one then\n\n\fR.

Both de Vaucouleurs\nand S\u00e9rsic COGs were used: de Vaucouleurs parameters are headed with (dV) while S\u00e9rsic parameters are headed (S); the S\u00e9rsic index n\nonly appears in this table for S\u00e9rsic COG fits (n = 4 for de Vaucouleurs COGs). Values of logRe are in kpc and values of h\u03bcie are corrected\nfor extinction (atmospheric and Galactic), Tolman dimming and the bandpass term of the K-correction (assuming the cosmology described\nin \u00a71). The apparent magnitudes m are calculated directly from the counts in the COG and have only been corrected for extinction, as\ndescribed in \u00a72.1.3. Uncertainties in the parameters (\u03c3) were calculated from simulation, including the correlation coefficient between\nlogRe and h\u03bcie (\u03c1, see \u00a72.3.1 & \u00a7A3). The flags represent the quality of the COG fits: 1 for galaxies whose COG was well represented by\nthe model COG; 2 for galaxies whose COG was not well represented by the model COG; 3 for galaxies whose COG did not asymptotically\ntend to a constant value and/or had severe contamination from neighbouring galaxies such that, even after masking, were unreliable (see\n\u00a7A2). Only galaxies with flags 1 or 2 enter the fitting process; galaxies #584 and #610 are BCGs which were fitted in some cases (c.f.\n\u00a73 and Table 7).\nSpec.\nID\n\nlogRe\n(dV)\n\nh\u03bcie\n(dV)\n\n\u03c1\n(dV)\n\nm\n(dV)\n\nFlag\n(dV)\n\nlogRe\n(S)\n\nh\u03bcie\n(S)\n\n\u03c1\n(S)\n\nm\n(S)\n\nn\n(S)\n\nFlag\n(S)\n\n286\n341\n368\n371\n390\n398\n433\n435\n463\n476\n481\n501\n508\n514\n531\n549\n567\n584\n593\n601\n610\n635\n636\n645\n655\n670\n677\n690\n698\n717\n723\n724\n726\n753\n755\n756\n814\n816\n848\n852\n874\n883\n906\n\n0.40\u00b10.35\n0.37\u00b10.35\n1.02\u00b10.34\n0.40\u00b10.35\n0.41\u00b10.35\n0.25\u00b10.35\n0.70\u00b10.37\n0.63\u00b10.35\n0.60\u00b10.35\n0.44\u00b10.35\n0.25\u00b10.35\n0.82\u00b10.35\n0.57\u00b10.35\n0.45\u00b10.35\n0.35\u00b10.35\n0.66\u00b10.35\n0.12\u00b10.35\n1.48\u00b10.34\n0.25\u00b10.35\n0.56\u00b10.35\n1.04\u00b10.34\n0.63\u00b10.35\n0.59\u00b10.35\n0.60\u00b10.35\n0.67\u00b10.35\n0.39\u00b10.35\n0.81\u00b10.35\n0.76\u00b10.34\n0.43\u00b10.35\n0.33\u00b10.35\n0.51\u00b10.35\n0.44\u00b10.35\n0.63\u00b10.35\n0.83\u00b10.34\n0.33\u00b10.37\n0.95\u00b10.34\n0.72\u00b10.35\n0.29\u00b10.35\n0.41\u00b10.35\n0.19\u00b10.35\n0.60\u00b10.35\n0.81\u00b10.35\n0.46\u00b10.35\n\n19.79\u00b11.10\n19.34\u00b11.10\n21.37\u00b11.10\n20.38\u00b11.10\n19.74\u00b11.10\n18.87\u00b11.10\n22.11\u00b11.13\n20.62\u00b11.10\n20.45\u00b11.10\n19.17\u00b11.10\n19.31\u00b11.10\n21.01\u00b11.10\n20.16\u00b11.10\n19.83\u00b11.10\n20.27\u00b11.10\n20.45\u00b11.10\n18.64\u00b11.10\n22.07\u00b11.09\n19.55\u00b11.10\n21.01\u00b11.10\n20.99\u00b11.10\n20.25\u00b11.10\n20.68\u00b11.10\n20.02\u00b11.10\n20.75\u00b11.10\n19.36\u00b11.10\n20.98\u00b11.10\n19.88\u00b11.10\n20.34\u00b11.10\n19.29\u00b11.10\n19.95\u00b11.10\n20.41\u00b11.10\n19.90\u00b11.10\n19.85\u00b11.10\n20.86\u00b11.13\n20.61\u00b11.10\n20.52\u00b11.10\n19.75\u00b11.10\n19.64\u00b11.10\n19.45\u00b11.10\n19.94\u00b11.10\n21.18\u00b11.10\n20.71\u00b11.10\n\n-0.998\n-0.999\n-0.999\n-0.998\n-0.998\n-0.998\n-0.993\n-0.999\n-0.999\n-0.999\n-0.998\n-0.999\n-0.999\n-0.998\n-0.998\n-0.999\n-0.998\n-0.999\n-0.998\n-0.998\n-0.999\n-0.999\n-0.998\n-0.999\n-0.999\n-0.999\n-0.999\n-0.999\n-0.998\n-0.998\n-0.999\n-0.998\n-0.999\n-0.999\n-0.993\n-0.999\n-0.999\n-0.998\n-0.998\n-0.998\n-0.999\n-0.999\n-0.998\n\n18.78\u00b10.00\n18.47\u00b10.00\n17.24\u00b10.00\n19.33\u00b10.00\n18.65\u00b10.00\n18.60\u00b10.00\n19.57\u00b10.00\n18.42\u00b10.00\n18.43\u00b10.00\n17.95\u00b10.00\n19.02\u00b10.00\n17.86\u00b10.00\n18.30\u00b10.00\n18.57\u00b10.00\n19.48\u00b10.00\n18.09\u00b10.00\n18.99\u00b10.00\n15.62\u00b10.00\n19.27\u00b10.00\n19.16\u00b10.00\n16.77\u00b10.00\n18.05\u00b10.00\n18.72\u00b10.00\n17.97\u00b10.00\n18.36\u00b10.00\n18.37\u00b10.00\n17.89\u00b10.00\n17.07\u00b10.00\n19.19\u00b10.00\n18.61\u00b10.00\n18.38\u00b10.00\n19.17\u00b10.00\n17.73\u00b10.00\n16.68\u00b10.00\n20.16\u00b10.00\n16.81\u00b10.00\n17.89\u00b10.00\n19.27\u00b10.00\n18.55\u00b10.00\n19.46\u00b10.00\n17.92\u00b10.00\n18.10\u00b10.00\n19.39\u00b10.00\n\n2\n2\n2\n1\n1\n2\n2\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n1\n1\n3\n1\n2\n3\n3\n3\n2\n2\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n3\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n1\n1\n2\n1\n2\n2\n\n0.35\u00b10.13\n0.35\u00b10.13\n0.85\u00b10.03\n0.47\u00b10.20\n0.37\u00b10.13\n0.22\u00b10.11\n0.57\u00b10.20\n0.68\u00b10.08\n0.63\u00b10.08\n0.39\u00b10.05\n0.26\u00b10.11\n0.80\u00b10.06\n0.43\u00b10.06\n0.94\u00b10.09\n0.33\u00b10.20\n0.64\u00b10.06\n0.13\u00b10.16\n0.99\u00b10.00\n0.25\u00b10.16\n0.46\u00b10.13\n1.05\u00b10.03\n0.78\u00b10.09\n0.70\u00b10.31\n0.55\u00b10.04\n0.72\u00b10.07\n0.36\u00b10.05\n0.92\u00b10.08\n0.67\u00b10.01\n0.37\u00b10.06\n0.33\u00b10.13\n0.48\u00b10.05\n0.51\u00b10.12\n0.65\u00b10.06\n0.81\u00b10.03\n0.29\u00b10.35\n1.19\u00b10.05\n0.58\u00b10.04\n0.27\u00b10.13\n0.40\u00b10.16\n0.18\u00b10.22\n0.56\u00b10.05\n0.63\u00b10.03\n0.39\u00b10.20\n\n19.66\u00b10.39\n19.28\u00b10.39\n20.77\u00b10.07\n20.65\u00b10.71\n19.59\u00b10.39\n18.80\u00b10.29\n21.68\u00b10.46\n20.79\u00b10.29\n20.57\u00b10.29\n19.03\u00b10.15\n19.40\u00b10.29\n20.92\u00b10.17\n19.70\u00b10.14\n21.80\u00b10.33\n20.29\u00b10.46\n20.35\u00b10.17\n18.67\u00b10.51\n20.47\u00b10.01\n19.58\u00b10.51\n20.65\u00b10.39\n21.03\u00b10.08\n20.83\u00b10.33\n21.13\u00b11.14\n19.83\u00b10.11\n20.94\u00b10.23\n19.24\u00b10.15\n21.38\u00b10.29\n19.60\u00b10.03\n20.19\u00b10.14\n19.33\u00b10.39\n19.85\u00b10.15\n20.67\u00b10.39\n20.01\u00b10.20\n19.79\u00b10.08\n20.72\u00b11.02\n21.53\u00b10.18\n20.04\u00b10.11\n19.69\u00b10.39\n19.59\u00b10.51\n19.43\u00b10.57\n19.80\u00b10.15\n20.59\u00b10.07\n20.55\u00b10.46\n\n-1.000\n-1.000\n-0.999\n-1.000\n-1.000\n-1.000\n-1.000\n-1.000\n-1.000\n-1.000\n-1.000\n-1.000\n-0.999\n-1.000\n-1.000\n-1.000\n-1.000\n-0.998\n-1.000\n-1.000\n-1.000\n-1.000\n-1.000\n-1.000\n-1.000\n-1.000\n-1.000\n-0.999\n-0.999\n-1.000\n-1.000\n-1.000\n-1.000\n-1.000\n-1.000\n-1.000\n-1.000\n-1.000\n-1.000\n-1.000\n-1.000\n-0.999\n-1.000\n\n18.86\u00b10.00\n18.52\u00b10.00\n17.50\u00b10.00\n19.24\u00b10.00\n18.71\u00b10.00\n18.67\u00b10.00\n19.77\u00b10.00\n18.36\u00b10.00\n18.38\u00b10.00\n18.03\u00b10.00\n19.08\u00b10.00\n17.91\u00b10.00\n18.5

This affects only 4/77 of galaxies, two of which could\nenter the KR and FJR as they have good HST surface photometry (#883 & #906).\nWe corrected our velocity dispersion measurements\nfor aperture effects. Each spectrum was extracted from a\nrectangular aperture of size 1.\u2032\u2032 4 by 1.\u2032\u2032 0 and corrected to\nthe equivalent circular radius following the procedure in\nJ\u00f8rgensen et al. (1995b). We also correct our aperture dispersion measurements \u03c3ap to a velocity dispersion measured\nwithin a standard aperture size (1.62 kpc, equivalent 3.\u2032\u2032 4\nat the distance of Coma, J\u00f8rgensen et al. 1995b). The relation in J\u00f8rgensen et al. (1995b) is slightly different to the\none found by Cappellari et al. (2006); however, the effect\nof this difference on our aperture corrections is small and\nwe persist with the J\u00f8rgensen et al. relation for comparison\nwith the literature.\n\n2.7\n\nFigure 4.

We divided each input spectrum in four parts\nand fit them separately: wavelengths less than 4050 \u00c5; between 4050 \u00c5 and 4650 \u00c5; between 4650 \u00c5 and 5650 \u00c5, and\nwavelengths greater than 5650 \u00c5 (all wavelengths quoted in\nthe rest frame of the cluster). We also excluded regions affected by telluric absorption from the fit, such as the range\n6850 < \u03bb(\u00c5) < 6950. For each wavelength range a new bestfit stellar template was found. Fig. 4 shows the dispersions\ncalculated from the middle two sections (4050 \u00c5 \u2013 4650 \u00c5\nand 4650 \u00c5 \u2013 5650 \u00c5) have the least scatter; thus we average the dispersions from these two regions for all subsequent\nanalysis.\nAlthough PPXF can determine dispersions less than\nthe instrumental resolution (\u2248 75 km s\u22121 at 0.5 \u03bcm), the errors (both random and systematic) increase. Consequently,\nwe decided that dispersions found to be less than 50 km s\u22121\n\nThe local comparison sample\n\nTo draw conclusions about the changes in the properties of\nthe galaxies in Abell 1689 (at z=0.183), we need to compare\nthem with local (z \u2248 0) galaxies. For a fair comparison, we\nmust select the local galaxies from a similar environment\nto the Abell 1689 galaxies (i.e. from a massive cluster) and\nthe only suitably dense nearby environment is the Coma\ncluster (z = 0.024, Han & Mould 1992) at a distance of 103\u00b1\n10Mpc (Liu & Graham 2001, Thomsen et al. 1997 but see\nalso Jensen et al. 1999).\nFortunately, the ETGs in the Coma cluster have\nbeen rigorously investigated in the past. Like previous authors (Ziegler et al. 2001; La Barbera et al. 2003; Barr et al.\n2005), we start with the data from J\u00f8rgensen et al. (1999a,\nhereafter J99): a total of 116 velocity dispersions for galaxies\nin Coma were compiled from the literature and homogenised\nin this work. We then compare the sample with the photometry of J\u00f8rgensen et al. (1995a, hereafter J95a) and find that\nall but 2 galaxies have Gunn r surface photometry available (calculated by fitting de Vaucouleurs curve-of-growth\nmodels). We adopt the formal uncertainties given in J95a\nand J99 but refrain from imposing covariances. Furthermore, we do not attempt to update the Galactic extinction,\nK-corrections or cosmological corrections but use the data\nas presented and model them (\u00a74) as though they were observed at z = 0.0. We determine that this sample is 50%\ncomplete to r\u2032 = 14.8 (equivalent to Mr\u2032 = \u221220.28 ,see\n\u00a7C2).\n\n\f12\n\nR. C. W. Houghton, Roger L. Davies, E. Dalla Bont\u00e0, R.

Velocity dispersions measured to be\n< 50km s\u22121 were deemed unreliable (well below the resolution of\nthe instrument) and replaced with an upper limit of 50km s\u22121 ;\nthese points are not used when fitting the scaling relations, but\nare shown (as diamonds) in Fig. 6.

In a hierarchical picture, one expects more massive DM halos to collapse earlier\nand potentially produce galaxies earlier; thus, if Abell 1689\nwere considerably more massive than Coma was at z=0.183,\nit is not unreasonable to claim that the Abell 1689 population would be older, leading to a smaller CMR scatter\nand \u2206\u03b2, thus biasing our measurements. We now look at\nthese two clusters in detail and discuss how similar or different they are. We address the X-ray luminosities, the cluster\nmasses and the known details of the galaxy populations to\ngauge how robust our approach is.\nWhile Coma is relatively X-ray bright (LX =7.21\u00d71044\nerg s\u22121 ), its luminosity somewhat dwarfed by the\n(exceptionally) high X-ray luminosity of Abell 1689\n(LX =20.74\u00d71044 erg s\u22121 ). On X-ray luminosity evidence\nalone, one might conclude that the mass of Abell 1689\nis many times the mass of Coma, or that Abell 1689\nhas recently undergone a merger (it hasn't, according to\nthe relaxed nature of the X-ray contours, Lemze et al.\n\n2008). However, the X-ray luminosity is only part of the\npicture; indeed, detailed X-ray modelling of Coma and\nAbell 1689 indicate that their total masses are quite comparable given the modelling uncertainties (around 5 \u00d7 1014\nM\u2299 : Mason & Myers 2000; Ettori et al. 2002; Peng et al.\n2009; Riemer-S\u00f8rensen et al. 2009; Mahdavi et al. 2008).\nThe lensing view on the two cluster masses is broadly similar: although Abell 1689 appears marginally more massive\nthan Coma, there is considerable scatter in the lensing estimates (mass estimates for both are around 1 \u2212 2 \u00d7 1015 M\u2299 :\nKubo et al. 2007; Gavazzi et al. 2009; Okabe et al. 2010;\nBroadhurst et al. 2005; Halkola et al. 2006; Mahdavi et al.\n2008).\nWe note (like many others) that the X-ray masses of the\ninner regions of clusters are generally estimated to be half\nthose of the lensing measurements. Oguri et al. (2005) and\nMorandi et al. (2011) were able to resolve this discrepancy\nwith triaxial halos and suggest Abell 1689 is viewed along\nits major axis. This is unlikely for Coma as we see the two\ncentral BCGs well separated on the sky. Thus certain discrepancies between Coma and Abell 1689 could in part be\ndown to projection effects.\nIn terms of mass evolution, it is unlikely that Abell 1689\nwill become much more massive between z=0.183 and now:\naccording to the work of Fakhouri et al. (2010), for halo\nmasses > 1014 M\u2299 , the rate of change of mass at 0 < z < 0.2\nis < 4\u00d7104 M\u2299 yr\u22121 : therefore, the expected increase in mass\nover 2.26 Gyr is < 9.2 \u00d7 1013 M\u2299 , which is a small fraction\nof the total mass.\nThus we conclude that, aside from projection effects\nfrom possible triaxiallity, the two clusters are well matched\nin mass and are both reasonably relaxed.\n2.8\n\nMagnitude conversions, Cosmological\ncorrections and evolution measurements\n\nWe cannot compare the Coma data to the Abell 1689 data\ndirectly: the data are in different filter bands using different magnitude systems. Furthermore, the Abell 1689 data\nare affected by cosmological dimming (the Coma data has\nbeen corrected for this, see \u00a72.7) and evolution of the stellar\npopulation (the magnitude of which we wish to determine).\nTherefore, we must address these differences and where appropriate apply corrections or model the effects (see \u00a74).\n2.8.1\n\nMagnitude systems\n\nThe Coma data of JF95a was observed in the Gunn r-band\nusing the Gunn photometric system (relative to a subdwarf\nF6 star) whereas the HST F625W observations are in the\nAB system. We convert the Gunn r photometry to the AB\nsystem using the corrections listed in Frei & Gunn (1994).\n2.8.2\n\nCosmological Corrections\n\nWhen we observe galaxies at significant redshifts, it is necessary to correct for cosmological effects (i.e. expansion and\nredshift). We adopt the approaches described in Hogg (1999)\nand Hogg et al. (2002) to correct our measurements. We\nsplit the K-correction (Hogg et al. 2002) into two terms,\nK = Kb + Kc .\n\n(12)\n\n\fData and 2D scaling relations for galaxies in Abell 1689: a hint of size evolution at z\u223c0.2\nThe bandpass term Kb is easily corrected in the AB magnitude system by reducing the observed brightness by (1 + z).\nHowever, the colour term Kc depends on the details of the\nunderlying stellar population which change with age, metallicity, initial mass function (IMF), dust content, etc.. J95a\nassumed no evolution of the galaxy SED when calculating\nthe colour term of the K-correction Kc for the Coma data,\nwhich is a good approximation at low redshift. But at higher\nredshifts, we do not know the exact SED so we do not apply a Kc correction to our measurements of Abell 1689. In\n\u00a74, we describe how we model our observations by calculating magnitudes based on stellar population models in\nblueshifted filter profiles, thus negating the need for Kc .\nHowever, it is necessary to correct for Tolman dimming\n(Tolman 1930; Lubin & Sandage 2001). Incorporating this\nand Kb , the bandpass limited AB surface brightness \u03bcobs\nis related to the bandpass limited rest-frame AB surface\nbrightness \u03bcrest by\n\u03bcrest = \u03bcobs + 7.5log(1 + z).\n\n(13)\n\nFurthermore, we can calculate apparent magnitudes using\nm = h\u03bcie,rest \u2212 5log(Re ) \u2212 2.5log(2\u03c0) + 7.5log(1 + z) (14)\nand (bandpass corrected) absolute magnitudes using\nM = m + 2.5log(1 + z) \u2212 5log(DL ) + 5\n\n(15)\n\nwhere Re is measured in arcseconds and DL is the luminosity\ndistance in pc.\n2.8.3\n\nSize evolution\n\nRecent literature suggests that galaxies (both disks and\nspheroids) were more compact in the past (Mo et al. 1998;\nFerguson et al. 2004; Bouwens et al. 2004; Trujillo et al.\n2007; van der Wel et al. 2008; Hopkins et al. 2009). The details are still very much a topic of debate: the degree of\ncompactness could depend on galaxy mass (Barden et al.\n2005; McIntosh et al. 2005; Trujillo et al. 2007). We measure Re , h\u03bcie and \u03c3 (for Coma and Abell 1689) with and\nwithout correcting size evolution. The corrections we apply assume that the effective radius now, Re , is related to\nthe effective radius at non-zero redshift, Re,z , by a simple\npower-law scaling,\nlog(Re ) = log(Re,z ) + \u03b6log(1 + z)\n\n2.9\n\nFitting 2D scaling relations\n\nThere are many different techniques available to fit (thereby\nrepresent) scaling relations. The disadvantages and limitations of common techniques are discussed by Hogg et al.\n(2010) who advocate Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nmethods. We follow these guidelines and use MCMC methods to explore the posterior distributions of the parameters\nin each assumed model ; details are given in Appendix C.\nWe investigate three different models: one where the data\n(with uncertainties) are drawn from a linear relation with\nunknown slope, intercept and intrinsic dispersion and we do\nnot attempt to correct for magnitude cuts or selection effects\n(hereafter the linear model or LM); a double linear model\nwhere two sets of data (with uncertainties) are assumed to\nhave the same slope and intrinsic dispersion but with different intercepts and we apply corrections for magnitude cuts\nand selection effects (hereafter the double linear model or\nDLM); and finally, a model where the data are drawn from\na mixture of two distributions: one being the linear model\nas before, and another outlier distribution having unknown\nfirst and second moments (hereafter the mixture model, or\nMM). In all cases, we assume normal distributions for the\nmodels.\nWe use the LM and DLM to fit the KRs and FJRs of\nComa and Abell 1689 to measure any offset (i.e. evolution)\nbetween them. We use the MM to isolate and measure the\nintrinsic scatter of the CMR in Abell 1689.\n\n3\n(17)\n\nThe value of \u03b6 is still debated: for massive, high concentration galaxies, Bouwens et al. (2004) find \u03b6 = 1.05\u00b10.21 over\nthe range 2.5 < z < 6 which agrees with van der Wel et al.\n(2008) who found \u03b6 = 0.98\u00b10.11 between 0 < z < 1 for morphologically selected ETGs. However, Trujillo et al. (2007)\nfound slightly stronger evolution for massive spheroid-like\n(highly concentrated) galaxies: a factor of 4 \u00b1 0.4 since\nz = 1.5, equivalent to \u03b6 = 1.6. We adopt a value \u03b6 = 1.0 in\nthis work.\nWe also calculate the equivalent velocity dispersion\nnow, \u03c3, from the velocity dispersion measured at higher redshift, \u03c3z , to be\nlog(\u03c3) = log(\u03c3z ) \u2212 0.5\u03b7log(1 + z).\n\nwith \u03b7 = 1.0. In dynamical models of S\u00e9rsic-like\ngalaxies, the projected line-of-sight velocity dispersion\nchanges in this way when Re is scaled, if the S\u00e9rsic index is unchanged Ciotti (1991). However, Hopkins et al.\n(2010) suggest the S\u00e9rsic index does change. The effect\nof size evolution on the velocity dispersion is difficult\nto measure and not well constrained (van der Wel et al.\n2008; Cappellari et al. 2009; van Dokkum et al. 2009;\nHopkins et al. 2010). Cenarro & Trujillo (2009) report a\nvalue of \u03b7 \u2248 0.6 while the single observation by\nvan Dokkum et al. (2009) would suggest \u03b7 \u2248 2. In the absence of a clear measurement of the change in the S\u00e9rsic\nindex, we adopt \u03b7 = 1.0.\n\n(16)\n\nand therefore, assuming no other changes,\nh\u03bcie = h\u03bcie,z + 5\u03b6log(1 + z).\n\n13\n\n(18)\n\nRESULTS AND ANALYSIS\n\nWe present the Faber-Jackson relation, the Kormendy relation and the colour magnitude diagram for Abell 1689,\nbelow. As discussed in \u00a71.3, we will present and analyse the\nFP in a future paper.\n\n3.1\n\ng'- r' Colour Magnitude Diagram\n\nThe raw g\u2032 -r\u2032 colour magnitude diagram (CMD) for\nAbell 1689 was presented earlier in Fig. 3, showing only\nthe data where the uncertainties were less than 0.1 mag.\nThe RS is clearly visible, along with a blue cloud. We also\nover plot (dotted lines) the selection limits for the GMOS-N\nspectroscopic sample and show as an insert the luminosity distribution of the parent sample and the spectroscopic\nsample.\n\n\f14\n\nR. C. W. Houghton, Roger L. Davies, E. Dalla Bont\u00e0, R. Masters\n\nFigure 5. CMD with RS shown (red) and outliers (green) rejected by the MCMC mixture model.\n\n3.1.1\n\nMeasured scatter of the CMR in Abell 1689\n\nWe use a mixture model (see \u00a72.9 & Appendix C) to measure\nthe slope, intercept and intrinsic scatter of the CMR (Eq.\n4). We restrict the galaxies in the sample to be brighter\nthan r\u2032 < 22 mag as well as the constraints described \u00a72.3.\nWe do not apply constraints on the recession velocities or\nmorphologies of the galaxies, which can only increase the\nmeasured scatter.\nThe results of fitting the MCMC mixture model are\ngiven in Table 7; in particular, the intrinsic scatter is found\nto be \u03c3CMR =0.054 \u00b1 0.004 mag.\nIn Fig. 5 we show the CMD of Abell 1689 with the\ngalaxies marked according to which of the two distributions\nthey were most likely to be members of. We also show the\nbest fit to the CMR, marginalised over all other parameters. There is an excess of galaxies below the RS, and a few\nabove, which are considered to be outliers by the mixture\nmodel (points highlighted in green), but the mixture model\nhas successfully isolated the RS (points highlighted in red)\nwithout any cut in colour or clipping imposed a priori. The\nlimit in magnitude (r\u2032 < 22 mag) affects the resulting scatter significantly: brighter (lower) magnitude cuts decrease\nthe scatter while fainter (higher) magnitude cuts increase\nthe scatter. Magnitudes are taken from the entire GMOS\nr-band image, with dimensions 280\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 300\u2032\u2032 .\nBKT98 quote Coma's CMR scatter inside R < 600 kpc\nto be 0.049 for all galaxies brighter than MV < \u221218.2 mag\n(98 galaxies). We fit the CMR to galaxies brighter than\nMV < \u221217.90 mag inside R <570 kpc. The selection effects\nand resulting scatter in both clusters is very similar; the\nscatter in Coma is slightly smaller though uncertainties are\nnot given by BKT98. More recently, Terlevich et al. (2001)\nperformed a more extensive study of the CMR in Coma: for\nall galaxies brighter than MV < \u221218.2 mag in roughly a\nsquare degree (175 galaxies), they quote an intrinsic scatter\nof 0.063\u00b10.008\n0.01 mag, which is statistically consistent with our\nresult for Abell 1689 (although our uncertainties are a factor\nof 2 smaller).\nWe highlight a handful of objects at relatively faint\nmagnitudes (r\u2032 \u223c 21 mag) that lie above the CMR. These ex-\n\ncessively red objects are found beyond r\u2032 > 20 mag, so they\ndo not enter our spectroscopic sample. Galaxies redder than\nthe RS could be excessively old, excessively metal rich, heavily extincted and/or intermediate or high redshift interlopers. Alternatively, we could be underestimating the scatter\nin the CMR at this magnitude (particularly because we assume a single scatter across all magnitudes). Terlevich et al.\n(1999) correlated the residuals of the CMR with spectral absorption line indices and showed that the galaxies scattered\nblueward of the mean relation have an increased hydrogen\nBalmer absorption and are thus younger: if the reverse is\ntrue, galaxies redder than the RS could be old relics from\nthe initial cluster population. It is also worth noting that\nfor ages approaching 14Gyr and metallicities around twice\nsolar, both the BC03 and M05 models predict a maximum\n\u2032 \u2032\ng\u2032 -r\u2032 colour of <\n\u223c 1.4. Thus the few objects redder than g -r\n=1.4 are unlikely to be part of the cluster unless they are\nextremely metal rich or extincted; conversely, the majority\nof the red objects that have g\u2032 -r\u2032 < 1.4 but are redder than\nthe RS could be cluster members, in principle.\n\n3.2\n\nThe Faber-Jackson relation\n\nTable 7 presents the results for fits to the FJRs (Eq. 1) of\nComa and Abell 1689 using individual linear models (LMs)\nand the double linear model (DLM).\nIn Abell 1689, the calculation of the surface photometry\nfor the central BCGs (brightest cluster or cD galaxies: #584\n& #610) was compromised by contamination from other\ngalaxies and the ICL. Similar arguments could be made for\nthe two BCGs in Coma (GMP2921 & GMP3329). Thus we\nfit the data both with and without the two BCGs and with\nand without correcting for size evolution (see \u00a72.8.3).\nThe values for \u2206\u03b2FJR in Table 7 were either calculated\nby subtracting the absolute magnitude of the FJR at log\u03c3 =\n2.2 (where the FJRs are best constrained in individual LMs)\nor directly when fitting the DLM to both the Abell 1689 and\nComa data. For nearly all cases, the galaxies in Abell 1689\nare fainter in the F625W band than the Coma galaxies in the\nr\u2032 -band. The evolution measured from the LMs and DLM\ngenerally agree, suggesting little bias from cuts or selection\neffects in the FJR.\nCorrecting for size evolution has a significant effect in\ndecreasing the measured evolution between Abell 1689 and\nComa, decreasing \u2206\u03b2 by around 0.25 mag; removing the\nBCGs increases \u2206\u03b2 by around 0.05 mag.\nFig. 6 shows the FJR measured for Abell 1689 in F625W\ncompared to that measured for Coma in the r\u2032 -band. Both\nde Vaucouleurs and S\u00e9rsic surface photometry are shown for\nAbell 1689 but only de Vaucouleurs photometry is available\nfor Coma. We have corrected the data points for size evolution and over plot the best fit DLM (omitting BCGs) in\neach case. The DLM fits the data well and both the Coma\nand Abell 1689 galaxies populate the same {m, \u03c3} parameter\nspace.\n\n3.3\n\nKormendy relation\n\nTable 7 presents the results for the fits to the

Parameters and marginalised uncertainties for the fits to the Faber-Jackson and Kormendy relations for Coma and Abell 1689\nas well as the CMR relation for Abell 1689. Model abbreviations are: MM=Mixture model; LM=Linear model; DLM=Double linear\nmodel. The column headed SEC shows whether a size evolution correction was applied (\u00a72.8.3). The Profile column shows if the surface\nphotometry (COG) was calculated using de Vaucouleurs (dV) or S\u00e9rsic (S) profiles. Note that in the double linear fits made to Coma\nand Abell 1689 data, the Coma data is archival and was measured using de Vaucouleurs COGs while for the Abell 1689 data we had\nthe option to fit S\u00e9rsic or de Vaucouleurs profiles. Where BCGs were removed from the fitting procedure, we removed galaxies #584 and\n#610 from the Abell 1689 sample and GMP2921 and GMP3329 from the Coma sample. For the KR and FJR, results in bold are the\nones we consider to be most reliable: note that without size evolution corrections the FJR and KR luminosity evolutions disagree (2\u03c3).\nTaking the average of (i.e. combining the samples for) the KR and FJR results corrected for size evolution while excluding BCGs gives\n\u2206\u03b2 =0.22 \u00b1 0.11 mag (see \u00a73.5) which we compare to stellar population models in \u00a74.2\n\n\f16\n\nR.

Squares\nrepresent good data while diamonds and arrows represent bad data (poor COG fits, or upper limits on velocity dispersions) that were\nexcluded from the fits. Small black squares represent Coma data from J\u00f8rgensen et al. (1995a, in the r-band, corrected to the AB system)\nand J\u00f8rgensen et al. (1999b) while large coloured symbols represent data for Abell 1689 (from HST/ACS F625W imaging and GMOS-N\nspectroscopy). Error ellipses on the Abell 1689 data are shown in light grey and account for correlations between each axis. The error\nbars are larger for the de Vaucouleurs data because they include the systematic errors associated with fixing the S\u00e9rsic index to n = 4.\nSolid lines show the results of fitting the double linear models without BCGs: the light solid line represents the Coma data while the\nbold solid line represents the Abell 1689 data. Dashed lines illustrate the magnitude cuts (50% completeness) for the Abell 1689 sample\n(bold dashed) and the Coma sample (light dashed). Note that bad points (diamonds) may lie outside the plotting window. Galaxies for\nwhich \u03c3 < 50km s\u22121 are shown as upper limits in the FJR (#724, #884 & #906).\n\nThe values for \u2206\u03b2KR in Table 7, like \u2206\u03b2FJR , were calculated both at logRe = 0.5 from individual LMs, and directly\nfrom the DLM. As before, we favour the values calculated\nby the DLM. As for the FJR, galaxies in Abell 1689 are\nfainter in the F625W band than Coma galaxies in the r\u2032 band (\u2206\u03b2 > 0). Unlike the FJR, there is a significant difference between the evolution measured from the LMs and the\nDLM: the KR is sensitive to magnitude cuts and selection\neffects which is unsurprising given that the cut runs almost\nparallel to the KR (unlike the FJR). Correcting for size evolution increases \u2206\u03b2KR only by around 0.05 mag, while including the BCGs has a negligible effect: clearly the KR is\nrelatively robust to these two factors.\nFig. 6 shows the KR measured for Abell 1689 in F625W\ncompared to that measured for Coma in the r\u2032 -band. Both\nde Vaucouleurs and S\u00e9rsic surface photometry are shown\n(for Abell 1689) and as before, we have corrected the data\nfor size evolution and over plot the best fit DLM (omit-\n\nting BCGs). The galaxies in Abell 1689 do not populate\nthe same {h\u03bcie , Re } parameter space as the Coma galaxies:\nthere appear to be more bright, compact galaxies in Coma.\nRecall that we have corrected the Abell 1689 galaxies for\nsize evolution, thus making them larger and fainter, but we\ndid not apply any cuts in Re or h\u03bcie a priori ; the only cut\nwas in absolute magnitude, which is well matched to the\nabsolute magnitude cut in the Coma sample. Indeed, using\nSExtractor effective radii as an estimate for size, there is\nno difference between the size distributions of our spectroscopic sample and the parent sample with r\u2032 < 19.5. Thus\nthe different locations of the Coma and Abell 1689 data\nalong the KR are not due to size selection effects.\n\n\fData and 2D scaling relations for galaxies in Abell 1689: a hint of size evolution at z\u223c0.2\n3.4\n\nThe effects of size evolution in the KR and\nFJR\n\nWithout correction for size evolution and excluding BCGs,\nthe measured \u2206\u03b2KR and \u2206\u03b2FJR disagree at the 2\u03c3 level.\nAlthough the need to correct for size evolution is at a modest\nstatistical significance, reviewing the effect reveals why the\nFJR was more affected than the KR.\nIf we consider both the corrections to Re and h\u03bcie , using our knowledge of how these two are related (Eq. 2) we\ncan infer how they shift the whole relation up or down in\nh\u03bcie , which can be (mistakenly) interpreted as luminosity\nevolution of the stellar population. Using Eq. 16 and Eq. 17\nin Eq. 2, we find\n\u2032\n\u03bce,z = \u03b1KR logRe,z + \u03b2KR + \u2206\u03b2KR\n\n(19)\n\n\u2032\n\u2206\u03b2KR\n= (\u03b1KR \u2212 5)\u03b6log(1 + z).\n\n(20)\n\nwith\n\n\u2032\n\nThis \u2206\u03b2KR appears as a change in the surface brightness; it\narises just from scaling the size of the galaxies and not from\nchanges in the stellar populations. We see that the effects\nfrom changing Re and h\u03bcie counteract with each other in\nthe KR: the typical value for \u03b1KR is \u223c 4, which with \u03b6 = 1,\n\u2032\n= \u2212log(1 + z). This tells us that if we were to\ngives \u2206\u03b2KR\ncompare h\u03bcie vs. logRe for Coma to h\u03bcie,z vs. logRe,z for\nAbell 1689, even without any changes in the stellar populations, we would find that the Abell 1689 galaxies appear\nbrighter than the standard KR prediction by log(1 + z).\nRepeating this analysis for the FJR relation using Eq.\n18 in Eq. 1, we find a similar relation to before\n\u2032\nM = \u03b1FJR log(\u03c3z ) + \u03b2FJR + \u2206\u03b2FJR\n\n(21)\n\n17\n\nonly marginalised over the model parameters fitted to each\ncluster, depend on where (on the x-axis) we compare the two\nclusters, and do not account for magnitude cuts or selection\neffects. We favour calculating \u2206\u03b2 using the DLM for these\nreasons. However, the DLM, as currently defined, cannot\naddress downsizing.\nWe should only consider values of \u2206\u03b2 which were calculated with size evolution corrections: without such corrections, \u2206\u03b2KR and \u2206\u03b2FJR disagree. Including BCGs reduces\n\u2206\u03b2FJR and has a negligible effect on \u2206\u03b2KR , but the changes\nare small and within the uncertainties. The average \u2206\u03b2 with\nBCGs is 0.23 mag while the average without BCGs is 0.22\nmag. We somewhat arbitrarily choose to use the values of\n\u2206\u03b2 calculated without the BCGs (see \u00a75.3). Finally, \u2206\u03b2\nmeasured using S\u00e9rsic photometry in Abell 1689 is on average slightly larger than that measured using de Vaucouleurs\nphotometry for Abell 1689, but the difference is far less than\nthe uncertainties. Consequently, we take the average of the\nKR and FJR offsets (excluding BCGs) using both S\u00e9rsic and\nde Vaucouleurs photometry as the overall luminosity evolution. We now seek the uncertainty in this value. The h\u03bcie\nand Re data used in the KR are strongly correlated to the\nmagnitudes used in the FJR so we cannot treat the uncertainties in \u2206\u03b2KR and \u2206\u03b2FJR as independent. We combine the\nMCMC samples for \u2206\u03b2KR and \u2206\u03b2FJR from the fits to S\u00e9rsic\nand de Vaucouleurs surface photometry, thereby assuming\nequal evidence for all these models and measure the difference in luminosity between the Coma galaxies (measured in\nrest-frame r\u2032 ) and the Abell 1689 galaxies (measured in the\nobserved-frame F625W) to be 0.22 \u00b1 0.11 mag. We do not\nattempt to quantitatively justify the assumption of equal\nevidence as the results from the different models are very\nsimilar.\n\nbut this time with\n\u2032\n\u2206\u03b2FJR\n= \u22120.5\u03b1FJR \u03b7log(1 + z).\n\n(22)\n\n\u2032\nas\nAs with the KR, one could easily misinterpret \u2206\u03b2FJR\nluminosity evolution of the stellar populations, but it is in\nfact just an effect of size evolution. However, unlike the KR,\nthe change is quite substantial. Our typical \u03b1FJR is \u223c \u22128 and\nwith \u03b7 = 1, gives \u2206M = 4log(1 + z). If we were to compare\nM vs. log\u03c3 for Coma to Mz vs. log\u03c3z for Abell 1689 and\nthere was no change to the stellar populations, we would still\nfind Abell 1689 galaxies to be fainter than the standard FJR\nprediction by 4log(1 + z). The canonical value for \u03b1F J R is\n\u223c 10 (L \u223c \u03c3 4 ), which increases the effect to 5log(1 + z).\nThus size evolution has opposite effects in the KR and\nthe FJR: it makes the KR of earlier galaxy populations appear brighter, the FJR fainter, and we observe these changes\nin \u2206\u03b2FJR and \u2206\u03b2KR .\n\n3.5\n\nLuminosity evolution from the KR and FJR\n\nAfter correcting for size evolution, the differences between\nthe KRs and FJRs of Coma and Abell 1689 (\u2206\u03b2KR and\n\u2206\u03b2FJR ) agree. To avoid propagating multiple calculations of\n\u2206\u03b2 any further, we now consider which values are our best\nestimates.\nThe values of \u2206\u03b2 calculated using the DLM account\nfor magnitude cuts and selection effects and are fully\nmarginalised over the other model parameters; the values\ncalculated from separate LMs to Coma and Abell 1689 are\n\n4\n\nSTELLAR POPULATION MODELS\n\nAs discussed in \u00a71, changes in the scaling relations can be\nunderstood in terms of evolution of the stellar populations.\nIn order to infer such evolution from the observations, it is\nnecessary to make use of stellar population synthesis models\nwhich reproduce the SED given some assumptions regarding\nthat population, such as the age, the IMF, the metallicity (Z)\nand the star formation history (SFH). The latter describes\nthe distribution of star formation over time and in our case\nis assumed to be a delta function at some previous time\n(i.e. a simple stellar populations or SSPs), so has a single\ncharacteristic age.\nIt is beyond the scope of this paper to perform an exhaustive comparison of all the possible models now available. We use two common population synthesis models\n(Bruzual & Charlot 2003 and Maraston 2005, hereafter\nBC03 and M05) to study the evolution of the scaling relations. Both provide SSP SEDs4 spanning a variety of ages,\nmetallicities and IMFs, although we only consider models\nusing a Salpeter IMF.\nWe use these models together with the filter curves provided by BC03 (SDSS and Gunn bands) and the GEMINI\n\n4\n\nhttp://www.cida.ve/\u223cbruzual/bc2003\n(BC03)\nhttp://www.icg.port.ac.uk/\u223cmaraston/ (M05)\n\nand\n\n\f18\n\nR. C. W. Houghton, Roger L. Davies, E. Dalla Bont\u00e0, R. Masters\n\nObservatory5 (GMOS-N r\u2032 and g\u2032 ) and the Vega and Solar\nspectra provided by the HST calibration database (CALSPEC6 ). We make use of the cosmolopy7 python library\nto calculate look back times and redshifts given our cosmological parameters (see \u00a71). The model magnitudes are\ncalculated so as to be comparable to observations that are\nK-corrected for bandpass effects (Kb ), but not for colour\neffects (Kc ).\nObservations of objects at different redshifts equate to\nobservations in different frames of reference (observer, rest),\nwhile all the model calculations are performed in the rest\nframe. This, together with the different magnitude systems\n(Vega, AB, Gunn) and the different epochs at which we observe our galaxies, need particular attention. Consequently,\nwhere necessary, we label the specified filter with the magnitude system, the frame of reference and the epoch of the\nobservation in parenthesis. For example, F625W(AB, z=0.0,\nT) refers to AB magnitudes of local objects in the F625W\nfilter, while F625W(AB, z=0.183, T-2.26 Gyr) refers to observations in F625W for an object at z=0.183 (the look back\ntime for an object at z=0.183 is 2.26 Gyr for our adopted\ncosmology). The difference F625W(AB,z=0.183,T-2.26 Gyr)\n- r\u2032 (AB,z=0.0,T) is what we measure when comparing our\nAbell 1689 data to the Coma data (i.e. \u2206\u03b2). We also find it\nuseful to quote model values for which we do not have observations: F625W(AB, z=0.183, T) refers to observations in\nthe blueshifted F625W filter at the current age of the Universe and so F625W(AB, z=0.183, T)-F625W(AB, z=0.183,\nT-2.26 Gyr) is just the luminosity evolution between now\nand 2.26 Gyr ago in the blueshifted F625W filter bandpass\n(approximately equivalent to the V-band).\nThese stellar population models can be used in many\nways, but we choose two distinct and very different techniques for the CMR analysis and KR/FJR analysis. We\npresent the BC03 and M05 results for modelling the passive\nevolution of SSPs as a function of age and various metallicities in both cases.\n\n4.1\n\nAnalysis of the g\u2032 -r\u2032 CMR\n\nAs discussed in \u00a71, the intrinsic scatter in the CMR tells us\nabout the SFH of the galaxies. We can perform a similar\nanalysis to BLE92 for Abell 1689, but using state of the art\npopulation synthesis models. Fig. 7 shows the rate of change\nof (g\u2032 -r\u2032 ) as a function of the age of the stellar population for\nthe BC03 and M05 models with solar and super-solar metallicities. Like BLE92 and BKT98, we smoothed the models;\nthe resulting systematic error was no more than 0.1 mag.\nOur SSP tracks in Fig. 7 are broadly similar to those of\nBLE92 and BKT98, but the M05 models show a more rapid\nfall in the rate of change of colour before <4 Gyr, followed\nby very slow or even negligible further reddening beyond > 4\nGyr.\nFollowing BLE92 and BKT98, we model the formation\nof galaxies with a uniform distribution of random events\ndistributed over a time interval \u2206t with mean age (now)\n\n5\n\nhttp://www.gemini.edu/sciops/instruments/gmos/\nhttp://www.stsci.edu/hst/observatory/cdbs/calspec.html,\npost Feb. 2010 update.\n7 http://roban.github.com/CosmoloPy/\n\n6\n\ntf . We parameterise the time interval \u2206t as a fraction, \u03b2,\nof the time available up to the end of \u2206t; when galaxies\nform between times tstart and tstop , \u2206t = tstop \u2212 tstart , and\n\u2206t = \u03b2tstop with 0 < \u03b2 < 1 (when \u03b2 = 1, galaxy formation\nis continuous from the start of the Universe to some final\ntime tstop so we have the largest possible scatter in ages and\nno synchronisation). We can write \u2206t in terms of tf ,\n\u2206t =\n\ntuniv \u2212 tf\n\u03b2 \u22121 \u2212 1/2\n\n(23)\n\nwhere tuniv is the age of the Universe now.\nAs noted by BLE92, if the slope of the CMR is produced\nby variation in metallicity with luminosity and all galaxies\nhave have identical IMFs, then the RMS scatter of the CMR,\n\u03c3CMR is related to the RMS scatter in the formation ages of\nthe RS galaxies, \u03c3age by\n\u03c3CMR\n\u2202(g\u2032 \u2212 r\u2032 )\n\u2248\n= f (age)\n\u03c3age\n\u2202t\n\n(24)\n\nwhere the RMS scatter \u03c3age \u2248 \u2206t/3.5 for the uniform distribution considered here (see BLE92 & BKT98).\nThe observed scatter in the CMR can therefore tell us\nabout the scatter in the formation times (synchronisation,\n\u03b2). But as galaxies become redder with time and the rate of\nchange of colour decreases, a small scatter in the CMD could\nalso imply a very old population with no synchronisation.\nEq. 24 can be written\n\u0012 \u22121\n\u0013\n\u2202(g\u2032 \u2212 r\u2032 )\n\u03b2 \u2212 1/2\n\u2248 3.5\u03c3CMR\n(25)\n\u2202t\ntuniv \u2212 tf\nFor a given \u03b2, there is an age, tf , which is compatible with\nthe observed scatter \u03c3CMR . In Fig. 7, we plot the LHS of Eq.\n25 (curves of \u2202(g\u2032 \u2212 r\u2032 )/\u2202t derived from stellar population\nmodels) and the RHS of Eq. 25 (\"beta\" curves). Where these\ncurves intersect gives the model age now that satisfies Eq.\n25. While BLE92 assumed that the variation in the rate of\nchange of colour with metallicity was sufficiently small that\nthey could consider only one metallicity (in effect assuming\nthat the slope of the CMR was zero), we investigate solar\nand super solar metallicities. Fig. 7 shows all these curves\nfor the BC03 and the M05 models. Significant differences\nonly exist for younger ages (i.e. for \u03b2 \u223c 0.6). We show the\n68% uncertainty limits for individual beta curves as dotted\nlines (based on the uncertainty in \u03c3CMR ).\nFig. 7 shows that \u03c3CMR in Abell 1689 is compatible with\na large range of ages, depending on the degree of synchronisation. BLE92 and BKT98 found the same for Coma and\nthat they argued that younger ages and smaller \u2206t are increasingly unlikely because such high SFRs would be easily\nvisible but are not observed. However, we observe Abell 1689\nsome 2.26 Gyr earlier than Coma: combining both results as\nthough we had observed the same cluster twice over a 2.26\nGyr interval adds another constraint: if the scatter in the\nCMR has not significantly changed over the last 2.26 Gyr,\nthen the rate of change of colour also cannot have changed\nappreciably over 2.26 Gyr. To try and put an upper limit on\nhow much the rate of change of colour could have changed\nover these 2.26 Gyr, let us consider a lower limit on the Coma\nCMR scatter of 0.036 mag (the scatter for just ellipticals\nwithin 600 Mpc in BTK98). The scatter of all RS galaxies\n2.26 Gyr earlier (in Abell 1689) is measured to be 0.054 mag;\nthis gives a maximum rate of change of -0.008 mag/Gyr for\n\n\fData and 2D scaling relations for galaxies in Abell 1689: a hint of size evolution at z\u223c0.2\n\nFigure 7. The rate of change of colour vs. the age of the stellar population for the gmos g'-r' colour using BC03 and M05\nmodels for solar and super-solar metallcities. The x-axis represents tf +2.26 Gyr, which is the age now, rather than the age at\nz=0.183; this is to allow easy comparison with Fig. 8.\n\nthe CMR scatter, or -0.028 mag/Gyr for the rate of change\nof colour. In Fig. 7, models that allow for such a small change\nover 2.26 Gyr have ages > 6 Gyr and \u03b2 > 0.6. According to\nthe exact intersections in Fig. 7, the galaxies in the RS of\nComa and Abell 1689 formed between 0.55 < z < 1.55 (have\n5.5 < age (Gyr) < 9.5), if the Abell 1689 RS evolves into the\nComa RS. The scatter could be overestimated in Abell 1689\n(we do not select galaxies by morphology or recession velocity), so the upper limit on age, like the lower limit on the\nscatter, could be questioned; thus we are only confident that\nthe galaxies in the RS of Coma and Abell 1689 are > 5.5\nGyr old (formed at z > 0.55). Similarly, only models with\n\u03b2 > 0.6 are consistent with this view.\n\n4.2\n\nAnalysis of the KR and FJR\n\nOur principle goal is to determine what (if any) luminosity and colour evolution has taken place between now and\nz=0.183. We use the BC03 and M05 models to calculate\nthe evolution of F625W(AB, z=0.183, T ) - r(AB, z=0.0,\nT ) as a function of the age, T (roughly a V-r colour).\nThis is shown in Fig. 8(a) and shows that after \u223c 4 Gyr,\nF625W(AB, z=0.183, T )-r(AB, z=0.0, T ) for the model populations changes slowly from 0.4 to 0.5 mag at 13 Gyr, so\nany ETG older than 6 Gyr now, would not be much bluer\nat z=0.183. Note that this colour is equivalent to the colour\nterm of the K-correction in Eq. 12, Kc : there is variation\nwith age and metallicity, which is why we do not try to\napply it to our measurements. We calculate the luminosity\nevolution over 2.26 Gyr for F625W(AB, z=0.183, T ) and\nr(AB, z=0.0, T ) in Fig. 8(b): here we see the evolution is\nvery similar for all models after 4 Gyr (to within \u223c0.1 mag)\nand drops rapidly with age. Finally, we calculate the luminosity evolution we measure when we compare the KRs\nand FJRs of Coma and Abell 1689 in Fig. 8(c) and Fig.\n8(d): the evolution of F625W(AB, z=0.183, T -2.26 Gyr) r(AB, z=0.0, T ) is dominated by the change in luminosity\n\n19\n\nand not colour after 4 Gyr, according to panels (a) and (b).\nAfter 6 Gyr, the solar metallicity models show the slowest\nrate of change and there is significant difference between the\nBC03 and M05 solar metallicity predictions; because lookback time is not linearly related to redshift, the evolution\nwith respect to redshift is almost asymptotically slow in (d).\nIn Fig. 8(c) and (d) we also over-plot the measured luminosity evolution (\u2206\u03b2) found between the galaxies of Coma\nand Abell 1689 (see \u00a73.5). The various stellar population\nmodels predict different ages for the Coma and Abell 1689\ngalaxies from this measurement: considering all models and\nthe 1\u03c3 limits, the luminosity evolution between Coma and\nAbell 1689 is consistent with an age > 6.0 Gyr . Limiting\nthe models to solar metallicities, the BC03 model suggests\nan age of 8.6\u00b14.9\n1.8 Gyr , while the M05 model suggests an\nage of 11.4\u00b1>3.6\nGyr (models only run to 15 Gyr): there\n3.9\nis a discrepancy between the ages inferred from the BC03\nand M05 solar metallicity models, the latter being older by\n2.8 Gyr, although both lower limits are comparable. In the\nabsence of any reasonable cause to discriminate between the\nBC03 and M05 models, we average the ages and uncertainties (i.e. combine the samples, assuming equal evidence for\nthe different models) to conclude that the galaxies in Coma\nand Abell 1689 are now 10.2 \u00b1 3.3 Gyr old (i.e. formed at\nz = 1.8\u00b1\u221e\n0.9 ). Note that because the M05 models are only\ncalculated to 15 Gyr and the 1\u03c3 upper limit on \u2206\u03b2 is greater\nthan the model predictions at that age, we can only quote\nthe upper limit from the BC03 model.\nIt is customary to quote the luminosity evolution in the\nsame band and our stellar population models allow us to\ncalculate this. The BC03 and M05 solar metallicity models both give a luminosity evolution of 0.25 mag in the\nF625W(AB,z=0.0) band and 0.23 mag in the r\u2032 (AB,z=0.0)\nband for their respective ages.\n\n\f20\n\nR.

We discuss the CMD first, followed by the FaberJackson and Kormendy relations and summarise the findings\nat the end.\n\n5.1\n\nThe CMR of Abell 1689\n\nThe scatter in the CMR of Abell 1689, \u03c3CMR =0.054 \u00b1 0.004\nmag (for all galaxies with MV < 17.9 mag within a projected\nradius of 570 kpc from the cluster centre) is comparable to\nthe bi-weight scatter quoted by Terlevich et al. (2001) of\n0.063\u00b10.008\n0.01 mag. Combining these results, we break the \u03b2\u2013\nage degeneracy and show that the galaxies in both clusters\nhave an age > 5.5 Gyr (and formed at z > 0.55) and had\n\nlittle or no synchronisation in their formation (\u03b2 > 0.6). We\nnow ask if this result is in agreement with other clusters at\nother redshifts. Then we compare Coma and Abell 1689 to\njudge if we are making a fair comparison. We also discuss the\nusefulness of placing lower limits on the CMR scatter and\nfinally explain why certain caveats in our approach should\nnot strongly bias the outcome.\n\n5.1.1\n\nAbell 1689 in perspective\n\nAs discussed in \u00a71.2, Stanford et al. (1995), Ellis et al.\n(1997), Stanford et al. (1998) and most recently Mei et al.\n(2009) have studied the CMR scatter in clusters up to\nz \u223c 1.3. The last two authors used a clipped bi-weight estimator to measure the CMR scatter; to our knowledge, we are\nthe first to model and extract the CMR scatter using a mixture model which does not rely on arbitrary cuts, clipping\n\n\fData and 2D scaling relations for galaxies in Abell 1689: a hint of size evolution at z\u223c0.2\nthresholds or parameter tuning. Furthermore, we present a\nCMR scatter that is marginalised over all reasonable slopes\nand intercepts, whereas previous work quotes values given\na measured slope and intercept. That said, the findings of\nthese papers agree with our work: the scatter in the CMR\nhas remained relatively unchanged in the ETG population\nof massive galaxy clusters since z\u223c 1.3. Both Stanford et al.\nand Mei et al. found the scatter in their clusters to be nearly\nalways less than 0.1 mag with the average being around 0.06\nand 0.05 mag, respectively. Both authors were also careful\nto discuss how selection effects may bias the determination\nof the CMR scatter at higher redshift (so-called progenitorbias): they selected galaxies morphologically to be Es and\nS0s, so mergers or spirals were excluded from the sample.\nWe know that more (blue) spirals exist in clusters at higher\nredshift (Butcher & Oemler 1984) so it is reasonable to consider that the population of galaxies on the CMR at higher\nredshift is not the same population observed at lower redshift. Furthermore, clusters grow over time and more field\nellipticals will join the cluster later on, producing a similar\nbias. But the bias is less here, because we do not morphologically select our galaxies and at z=0.183 we are only looking\n2.26 Gyr into the past, which is less time for change in the\nETG progenitors compared to Coma.\n\n5.1.2\n\nLower limits on the CMR scatter\n\nUntil now, no one has tried to interpret a lower limit on the\nscatter of the CMR. We do so now tentatively, because we\nknow that that scatter is likely to be smaller for just ellipticals and also for samples limited to more luminous galaxies.\nTaken at face value, the lower limit of the scatter measured\nhere suggests that, with \u03b2 = 1.0, the highest possible mean\nformation age for the RS galaxies of Abell 1689 is 9.8 Gyr in\nthe past (z = 1.7, a 1\u03c3 upper limit). This may be meaningless because we know we have mixed populations (ellipticals,\nS0s etc.) which increase the scatter, but in future surveys it\nmay be of interest to consider an upper bound on the mean\nformation redshift if we wish to dedicate effort to witnessing it. If all the stars in the Coma ETGs formed in the first\nGyr after the big bang (tf = 13.2 Gyr, \u03b2 = 1.0), the CMR\nscatter would be \u223c0.005 mag \u2013 seven times smaller than\nthat of Coma. It takes time for dark matter (DM) to cluster\nsufficiently to allow the baryons to start forming stars, but\nthe difference between a scatter of 0.036 mag and 0.005 mag\nin the CMR of Coma implies there was a delay of \u223c3 Gyr\nbetween the big bang and the average SF period for rich\nclusters (assuming \u03b2 = 1). This suggests that the majority\nof stars formed for z < 3 which is in agreement with the\ncosmic star formation history (Madau et al. 1996, 1998).\n\n5.1.3\n\nCaveats\n\nBKT98 investigated exponentially declining SFHs truncated\nat different times and also looked at the effects of merging.\nThey found the same conclusions as BKT92, validating the\nSSP approach used there (and here). We treat the random\nerrors in magnitude and colour as independent, but in reality they will be correlated: noise in the central aperture of\nthe r-band images will affect the colour term as well as the\ntotal r-band magnitudes. This will have minimal effect on\n\n21\n\nour scatter measurement, but could slightly affect the uncertainties. We investigated the assumption that Abell 1689\nwill evolve into Coma in \u00a72.7.1.\n5.2\n\nThe Faber-Jackson and Kormendy relations\n\nAfter correcting for size evolution, magnitude cuts and selection effects, analysis of the FJR and KR in Abell 1689 shows\nthat the Abell 1689 galaxies in F625W are fainter than the\nComa galaxies in rest frame r\u2032 -band by 0.22 \u00b1 0.11 mag,\nwhich suggest and age of 10.2 \u00b1 3.3 Gyr (z = 1.8\u00b1\u221e\n0.9 ). We\nnow compare these findings with the literature and discuss\nthe importance of correcting for size evolution.\n5.2.1\n\nEvidence for the passive evolution of ETGs\n\nThe luminosity evolution in the KR and FJR in Coma and\nAbell 1689 is consistent with a passively evolving stellar\npopulation from single burst 10 Gyr ago. This is in agreement with the long-standing findings that ETGs both locally and at moderate redshift appear to be dominated by\nold passively evolving stellar populations that formed at\nz > 1. The majority of precision age determinations stem\nfrom measurements of absorption line indices: although the\nbroad-band colours of the Coma ETGs have been known\nto be compatible with old populations for a long time\n(see \u00a71.1), the well documented age\u2013metallicity degeneracy\nlimits this approach for local clusters, but the degeneracy\ncan be reduced by modelling the absorption line indices of\nthe metals. Little work has been done specifically on the\ngalaxy populations of Abell 1689: Mieske et al. (2004) studies the ultra-compact dwarf fraction and luminosity function of the cluster galaxies while Ba\u00f1ados et al. (2010) study\nthe faint end of the luminosity function. Carretero et al.\n(2007) studied line indices of ETGs in 4 massive clusters\nat z \u223c 0.2 and found ages of around 10\u201315Gyr, but their\nsample did not include Abell 1689. Considerably more work\nhas been done on the galaxy populations of Coma, in particular with regard to determining the stellar population ages\n(Clemens et al. 2009; J\u00f8rgensen et al. 1999b; Mehlert et al.\n2003; S\u00e1nchez-Bl\u00e1zquez et al. 2006, 2009; Rakos et al. 2007;\nTrager et al. 2008; Smith et al. 2009; Harrison et al. 2010,\n2011; Price et al. 2011). There is still some uncertainty regarding the ages (and presence of multiple populations), but\nthe current evidence suggests ages between 5 and 10 Gyr for\nthe Coma ETGs. Our age estimate from the broad band photometry of Abell 1689 and Coma is therefore towards the top\nof this range, though the BC03 result alone (8.6\u00b14.9\n1.8 Gyr )\nis nearer the midpoint and the M05 result at the upper end\n(11.4\u00b1>3.6\nGyr (models only run to 15 Gyr)); intriguingly,\n3.9\nthe age range implied by just the scatters of the CMRs in\nAbell 1689 and Coma (5.5 < age (Gyr) < 9.5) brackets the\nliterature ages very well, even though earlier we expressed\ndoubt regarding this upper limit (see \u00a74.1).\n5.3\n\nThe effects of size evolution\n\nThe measured luminosity evolution between Abell 1689\nand Coma agrees with that of other clusters\n(Barrientos et al. 1996; Pahre et al. 1996; Ziegler et al.\n2001; La Barbera et al. 2003; Fritz et al. 2005), although\n\n\f22\n\nR.

Most did\nnot simultaneously study both the FR and FJR except for\nFritz et al. who found that the galaxies appeared brighter\nin the KR than in the FJR (but the 0.07 mag difference is\nconsiderably less than the 0.3 mag found here). Saglia et al.\n(2010) allow for size evolution in their study of the FP\nout to z \u223c 1. However, we are not probing a high redshift\ncluster, but a comparatively local cluster at z=0.183. The\nfact that we need size evolution to bring the KR and FJR\ninto agreement suggests that whatever causes it is a gradual\nprocess and its effects are not limited to the high-z universe;\nindeed, the mechanism is probably still in action now and\ndoes not appear to have deviated from the high-z (1 + z)\u03b6,\u03b7\nlaws.\nWhile there has been a reasonable passage of time between z=0.183 and now (2.26 Gyr), observing the size evolution taking place in the cluster environment and in the local\nUniverse place important restrictions on models that wish\nto explain size evolution, which we now discuss.\nMerging: Wet or dry major merger scenarios (e.g.\nKhochfar & Silk 2006; Hernquist et al. 1993; Hopkins et al.\n2009) are unlikely to occur in the cluster environment because cluster galaxies have a very high relative velocity\n(larger than the typical escape velocity of two massive galaxies) making it prohibitively difficult to merge galaxies. An\nexception are central BCGs which would likely merge when\nmultiple clusters merge as they lie at rest at the bottom of\nthe potential. Minor or late accretion of smaller galaxies (e.g.\nNaab & Trujillo 2006; Maller et al. 2006; Naab et al. 2009;\nHopkins et al. 2009, 2010) could be more feasible because\nof the larger number of low-mass satellites, but in general\nthe relative velocities would still be higher than the escape\nvelocity unless the impact was at glancing angle.\nAccretion: Accretion of the intra-cluster stars (previously\nstripped from other galaxies) may be energetically plausible, if not in mass transfer rates. However, while the simulations of Bois et al. (2011) and Khochfar et al. (2011) suggest that ATLAS3D slow rotators grow from minor accretions, Stott et al. (2011) finds no evidence of size evolution\nin BCGs up to z < 1.\nAdiabatic expansion: The action of AGN expelling gas as\nproposed by Fan et al. 2008 is perhaps unfeasible here because we know that massive reservoirs of gas are stripped\nwhen galaxies fall into a cluster (observed for gas rich spirals\nfalling into the cluster potential today, Chung et al. 2009).\nHowever, the mass lost from evolving stars could be gradually stripped by the ICM. Adiabatic expansion could also\noccur when central mass (dark or luminous) is stripped or\nharassed to larger radii by high speed encounters, which are\ninevitable in clusters.\nSecular/Cosmological expansion: There are few secular arguments (the action of bars and/or resonances) for size evolution in the literature at present and perhaps these should\nbe investigated further given our findings: if S0s are believed\nto be faded spirals (the vast majority of Es show fast rotating disc-like disk kinematics, Emsellem et al. 2007, 2011),\nthen whatever action reduces disks to spheroids could also\nbe responsible for the size evolution we observe. Recall also\nthat size evolution in disks was predicted as a consequence\nof them being truncated to the critical density (Mo et al.\n1998), which is entirely a secular/cosmological effect.\n\n5.3.1\n\nCaveats\n\nSome caveats to consider for our KR and FJR analysis include not correcting for colour gradients, invoking size evolution, not selecting galaxies morphologically or to be on the\nRS, and using non-independent PDFs as though they were\nindependent. We have already investigated the assumption\nthat Abell 1689 will evolve into Coma in \u00a72.7.1.\n\nAn important difference between the FJR and KR is\nthat the latter is potentially sensitive to internal colour gradients; this may be a source of error in our work given that\nour F625W observations of Abell 1689 are approximately\nrest-frame V-band compared to the Coma r-band observations. The colour gradients in ETGs cause them to be redder towards the centre; this makes Re larger at bluer wavelengths. Using the Coma data from J\u00f8rgensen et al. (1995a),\nwe find that Re in Gunn g is a mean of \u223c 5 \u00b1 15% (or a median of 2%) larger than Re in Gunn r. However, if one considers the combined effects in the KR, we find that they cancel\nto first order. Using the same s.ps that gave rise to Eq. 20, increasing Re by 5% leads to an apparent luminosity evolution\nof log(1.05) = 0.02 mag in the KR. If we calculate the difference between the central colour (h\u03bcie (g) \u2212 h\u03bcie (r)) and the\nglobal colour (g-r) from the J\u00f8rgensen et al. (1995a) data,\nwe find a mean [h\u03bcie (g) \u2212 h\u03bcie (r)] \u2212 [g \u2212 r] = of 0.05 \u00b1 0.35\nmag (median of 0.07 mag). Allowing for the large scatter,\nthis agrees with the above and is a negligible correction.\nTherefore we conclude that it is not necessary to correct for\ncolour gradients.\n\nWe have invoked the existence of size evolution to make\nsense of the different luminosity evolution seen in the KR\nand FJR. However, we have chosen a prescription for how\nthe size and internal kinematics of the galaxies change with\ntime based on the evidence to hand (\u00a72.8.3). Although this\nis the simplest approach, one could try to measure this prescription from the data by making the simple assumption\nthat variation in the mass-to-light is determined only by\npassive evolution of the stellar population, is independent\nof galaxy luminosity (or stellar/dynamical mass) and is the\nsame for the KR and the FJR.\nReaders may have noticed that we do not select\nAbell 1689 galaxies in the KR and FJR to be morphological\nE/S0s or to be on the RS (even though we have that information from the CMR analysis). This is deliberate: we do\nnot want to bias ourselves away from including (blue, spiral)\nprogenitors of ETGs in Coma. However, blue spirals tend to\nexclude themselves from our sample because they have velocity dispersions below our spectral resolution (most likely\nbecause the luminosity is dominated by light from central\ndynamically cold star forming regions). Of the 38 galaxies\nthat have sufficient quality spectra and HST imaging to enter the fitting procedures, only one is found not to be on\nthe RS (#435). Thus although we tried not to select just\nRS galaxies, we end up being significantly biased towards\nthem.\nWhen calculating the difference between the evolution\nseen in the KRs and the FJRs, we treated the PDFs as\nthough they were independent normal distributions. Neither\nof these assumptions is true (the Coma and Abell 1689 data\nused in both are obviously correlated), but it is the best\napproach we are reasonably able to take.\n\n\fData and 2D scaling relations for galaxies in Abell 1689: a hint of size evolution at z\u223c0.2\n6\n\n23\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have presented the Kormendy, Faber\u2013Jackson and\ncolour-magnitude relations for ETGs in Abell 1689 using\nHST/ACS imaging, GEMINI/GMOS imaging and GEMINI/GMOS spectroscopy and conclude:\n(i) The intrinsic scatter in the colour\u2013magnitude relation of Abell 1689 places degenerate constraints on \u03b2 (the\nratio of assembly timescale and time available) and the\nage of the population: specifically, it is consistent with\nthe galaxies in the colour\u2013magnitude relation having either formed randomly at high redshift (z >\n\u223c 2), or at lower\nredshift with increasing synchronisation (smaller assembly\ntimescales). However, assuming the intrinsic scatter of Coma\nand Abell 1689 is that of the same cluster observed twice\nover an interval of 2.26 Gyr breaks this degeneracy and limits \u03b2 to be > 0.6 (little or no synchronisation) and the age\nof the red sequence to be > 5.5 Gyr (formed at z > 0.55).\n(ii) After accounting for size evolution effects, the F625W\nKormendy and Faber\u2013Jackson relations both show a similar change in luminosity compared to the rest frame r\u2032 -band\nrelations of Coma: 0.22 \u00b1 0.11 mag. This is consistent with\npassive evolution of the stellar populations from a single\nburst of star formation long ago: the galaxies in Coma and\nAbell 1689 have an SSP age of 10.2 \u00b1 3.3 Gyr (i.e. formed\nat z = 1.8\u00b1\u221e\n0.9 ), which agrees with the CMR analysis above.\nHowever, not accounting for size evolution causes the Kormendy and Faber\u2013Jackson relations to be inconsistent and\nthey then disagree about the amount of luminosity evolution\nat the 2\u03c3 level.\n(iii) We therefore find weak evidence that size evolution\nappears to have taken place in the cluster environment in\nthe last 2.26 Gyr; if true, this places interesting constraints\non the models, favouring harassment or secular mechanisms\nover major or minor merger scenarios.\n\nAPPENDIX A: THE CURVE OF GROWTH\n(COG) TECHNIQUE AND ASSOCIATED\nERRORS\nThe COG method we use is in essence very simple: locate\nthe centre of the galaxy via some means (in our case, via\nellipse fitting); integrate out in radius to create a curve-ofgrowth function; fit an analytical curve-of-growth (Eq. 10),\nvarying the model parameters (apparent magnitude, m; effective radius, Re and S\u00e9rsic index n) to minimise the square\nof the residuals (\u03c72 ):\n\u03c72 =\n\nN\nX\ni=1\n\n[Di \u2212 Mi ]2\n\n(A1)\n\nwhere the sum is performed over samples i for the observed\nCOG Di and model COG Mi . We sample the COG at the\nplate scale of the input image.\nWe now discuss how we deal with: PSF effects, contamination and masking of other nearby galaxies, and estimating\nour uncertainties.\nA1\n\nPSF effects\n\nThe instrumental PSF of the image creates a systematic\ndifference between the observed and true COG. Saglia et al.\n\nFigure A1. An azimuthal average of multiple HST/ACS PSFs\n(black points); radially binned points (red) and MGE approximation (green). This MGE approximation is used with Eq. A2 to\naccount for PSF effects when fitting COGs.\n\n(1993), Trujillo et al. (2001a) and Trujillo et al. (2001b) describe methods to correct for this. However, the HST/ACS\nPSF is not well approximated by a single Gaussian or Moffat function, for which these methods were developed. We\napproximate the ACS PSF with a multi-Gaussian expansion\n(MGE, Bendinelli 1991). We azimuthally average (4-fold reflect) multiple PSFs from across the FOV (see \u00a72.2), bin\nradially, and then use a 1D MGE fitting routine to calculate\na radial approximation (made available by M. Cappellari\nCappellari 2002). Fig. A1 shows an example.\nWe make use of the well known result that the convolution of the S\u00e9rsic function I(R, Re , n) with a Gaussian\nG(r, \u03c3) is I \u2032 (R, Re , n, \u03c3) =\n\u0013\u0015 \u0012\n\u0014 \u0012 2\n\u0013\nZ x=\u221e\n1\nxR\n1 x + R2\nB\n(A2)\nI(x, Re , n) exp\n\u03c3 2 x=0\n2\n\u03c32\n\u03c3\nwhere B is a modified Bessel function of the first kind, zeroth\norder (Moffat 1969; Bendinelli et al. 1982). Summing this\naccording to the amplitudes of the MGE then provides a\ngood approximation to the full PSF convolution. We do not\naccount for ellipticity in the fitting process. A LevenbergMarquardt algorithm (MPFIT8 ) minimised \u03c72 to fit Re , Ie\nand n (we fix n = 4 for a de Vaucouleurs profile).\nWe find good agreement between this 1D approach and\nS\u00e9rsic profiles convolved with the full 2D HST/ACS PSFs:\nsystematic errors in recovered parameters (Re , Ie , m, Re Ie0.8 )\nare always <1% over a wide range of parameter space.\n\nA2\n\nContamination and Masking\n\nThe galaxies in Abell 1689 are densely packed and many\noverlap in projection. To remove this contamination, we initially bin azimuthally averaged profiles of the chosen galaxy\nand sigma-clip from the mode of each bin. If necessary, we\nfurther manually mask the images, ensuring identical masks\n\n8\n\nhttp://www.physics.wisc.edu/\u223ccraigm/\n\n\f24\n\nR. C. W. Houghton, Roger L. Davies, E. Dalla Bont\u00e0, R. Masters\nA3\n\nEstimating errors (random and systematic)\n\nWe use Monte-Carlo simulations to estimate uncertainties\nin the COG parameters. Generating S\u00e9rsic profiles of various Re , Ie and S\u00e9rsic index n convolved with a typical 2D\nHST/ACS PSF (see \u00a72.2), we add random sky offsets and\nread and shot noise to simulate real observations. We use\n100 realisations for each parameter combination (Re , m and\nn) over the parameter space of the obervations. We also\nvary the radius at which we stop the COG fitting according\nto the statistics of the real data. This approach allows us\nto estimate random and systematic uncertainties (the latter\nalways being < 1%).\nThe simulations show that logRe and logIe are very\nstrongly correlated. Decomposing the covariance matrix into\nprinciple components, the first component always accounts\nfor >98% of the variation: Re Ie0.6\u00b10.1 is best constrained\nwhile Re\u22120.6\u00b10.1 Ie is most poorly constrained. Knowing the\ncovariance matrix as a function of input Re and m allows\nus to use it when fitting the scaling relations; treating Re\nand Ie as independent significantly overestimates the error\nin the direction perpendicular to the KR which is important\nwhen minimising perpendicular residuals (see \u00a7C).\nFigure A2. Examples of the masking procedure before fitting\na curve of growth model. (a) HST/ACS F625W image of galaxy\n#286 which is relatively uncontaminated; (b) shows the mask applied to this image (black pixels) and (c) shows the result of the\nimage reconstruction from replacing masked pixels with a 2-fold\nreflection. (d) HST/ACS F625W image of galaxy #435 which\nhas considerable contamination; (e) shows the mask for this image and (f ) shows the reconstructed image, produced by replacing pixels with a 2-fold reflection or azimuthally averaged values.\n(g) galaxy #635 is so badly contaminated that a reliable measure of the COG is almost impossible; (h) shows the mask (leaving enough information to provide an azimuthal average) and (i)\nshows our best reconstruction. Although the reconstruction in (i)\nand the associated COG appear convincing, such results always\nscore a 3rd class rating because of the large uncertainties. Scales\non the x- and y-axis are in arcseconds, centred on the galaxy. The\ngreyscale is logarithmic and fixed throughout, to highlight faint\nstructure.\n\nfor both the de Vaucouleurs and the S\u00e9rsic COG fits to prevent systematic differences. To replace masked pixels, a simple 2-fold reflection about the galaxy centre was usually sufficient. When masking was more severe, after a 2-fold reflection, we azimuthally binned the image, averaged the modes\nof bins at each radius, and replaced masked pixels with this\naverage. This reconstructed strongly contaminated images\nand gave good COG fits. However, as a method of quality\ncontrol when the galaxy image was minimally contaminated\nand the model COG fitted the measured COG to within 2%,\nwe rated the fit 1st class; when the contamination was again\nrelatively minor but the model COG didn't fit the measured\nCOG to within 2%, the fit was rated 2nd class; finally, when\ncontamination was severe, such that we had little confidence\nin the measured COG and thus the model fit, we rated it 3rd\nclass (shown in Table 4). Examples of masking and image\nreconstruction are shown in Fig. A2.\n\nAPPENDIX B: MATCHING SPECTRAL\nRESOLUTIONS\nThe GMOS arc and sky lines appeared top-hat like because\nthe slit width, not the grating, dictated the spectral resolution. Matching spectral resolutions in this case is difficult:\nfirstly, the size or shape of the objects being observed in\nthe GMOS slits can define the resolution and spectral PSF\nif they are smaller than the slit width; secondly, the kernel required to match the spectral PSF of the stellar library\nwith the GMOS spectra will not be Gaussian. Fortunately,\nthe seeing FWHM (estimated by Gaussian fits to the profiles of guiding/alignment stars) is greater than the 0.\u2032\u2032 75\nslit width (varying between 0.\u2032\u2032 74 and 1.\u2032\u2032 49 with an average of 1.\u2032\u2032 06). Thus the illumination of the slits was roughly\nuniform and similar to that of the arc or sky lines, which\nenables us to use arc or sky lines as a reference for the spectral PSF of the galaxy spectra. An additional complication\nin matching spectral resolutions is that the width of the\nGMOS arc lines decreases over the wavelength range used\nto extract kinematics; if one matches local stellar templates\nto the observer-frame arc spectra then when later redshifting the templates to the galaxy rest-frame, the non-uniform\nspectral resolution would introduce a systematic difference\nbetween the stellar and galaxy resolutions.\nWe developed a technique to account for all these effects by finding a transfer function which, when convolved\nwith the spectral profile of the stellar library, reproduces\nthe spectral profile of the galaxy spectra (which is equivalent to reproducing line profiles of a blueshifted arc spectrum). We found the GMOS arc lines were well described by\na truncated Gauss\u2013Hermite (GH) expansion (Gerhard 1993;\nvan der Marel & Franx 1993):\n\" \u0012\n\u00132 # X\nN\n\u03b3\n(\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 )\nT (\u03bb) = \u221a\nexp \u2212\nhi Hi (\u03c9) , (B1)\n2\u03c3\n2\u03c0\u03c3\ni=0\nwhich is a Gaussian centred on \u03bb0 with scale factor \u03b3, disper-\n\n\fData and 2D scaling relations for galaxies in Abell 1689: a hint of size evolution at z\u223c0.2\n\n25\n\nsion \u03c3 weighted by a sum of Hermite polynomials Hi . Taking\nh0 = 1, we quantify deviations from a Gaussian using the\ntruncated series {h2 , h4 , h6 } (odd Gauss-Hermite moments\nare not required to describe a symmetric shape). Furthermore, given that positive values of hi (where i is even) provide more top-hat like profiles, whereas negative values give\nprofiles with large wings and sharp peaks, only positive hi\nvalues are required.\nWe then saught a Gauss-Hermite expansion which,\nwhen convolved with another Gaussian of FWHM equal\nto that of the stellar library resolution (1\u00c5), matched the\nblueshifted arc lines. We accomplished this by minimising\nthe \u03c72 difference given by the expression\n\u03c72 =\n\nN\nX\n\u0002\ni=1\n\nA\u2032i \u2212 Si (\u03c3 \u2032 ) \u2297 Ti (\u03c3, hj )\n\n\u0001\u00032\n\n(B2)\n\nwhere A\u2032 is the (blueshifted) arc line being fit, S is the\nspectral profile of the stellar library (width \u03c3 \u2032 ), T is the\nGauss-Hermite transfer function (Eq. B1) and the sum is\nperformed over pixels. Fig. B2 illustrates the parametric results of this process at various wavelengths (and what would\nhappen if we were not to account for the redshift effect). It\nis evident that a single transfer function with parameters\n{\u03c3, h2 , h4 , h6 } = {0.428\u00c5, 0.676, 0.0, 0.435} is sufficient to\ndegrade the spectral resolution of the stellar library to the\nblueshifted GMOS arc spectrum. We did occasionally experience a problem of multiple minima when fitting the convolved Gauss-Hermite transfer functions but careful choice\nof starting parameters solved the problem. Note that because the width (\u00c5) and properties of the transfer function\nare uniform in \u03bb space, we convolved the stellar library with\nT before resampling it to log \u2212 \u03bb space. Fig. B2 compares\nthe profile of the matched stellar library to a typical profile\nfor a (blueshifted) GMOS arc line: they are barely distinguishable from each other, confirming we are able to match\nthe spectral profile of the stellar library to that of the galaxy\nspectra.\n\nFigure B1. The best-fit transfer function, matching the spectral response of the stellar library to GMOS arc emission lines at\nvarious wavelengths. Parameters for the best-fit transfer functions (Eq. B1) to blueshifted arc spectra are approximately\nuniform for all wavelengths (asterisks) and are well approximated by a single function with parameters {\u03c3, h2 , h4 , h6 } =\n{0.428\u00c5, 0.676, 0.0, 0.435}. The widths of the GMOS arc lines\n(\u03c3, black diamonds) are not constant (in \u03bb or log \u2212 \u03bb space),\nwhich can introduce a systematic error when stellar templates\nare redshifted to the recession velocity of the cluster. The correct transfer function parameters, accounting for this effect are\nshown as green diamonds (previously the black asterisks fitted\nto blueshifted arc spectra, but now redshifted back). The widths\nof the transfer functions if we had not corrected for the redshift\neffect are shown as red diamonds: these appear roughly equal to\nthe raw arc widths (black diamonds) but this is bad because the\ntransfer function still needs to be convolved with the response\nof the stellar library; after this, the stellar templates would have\na larger spectral resolution than the galaxy spectra, introducing\na systematic error into the kinematics (dispersions would be too\nlow).\n\n\fR.

Here we\ndiscuss those models in more detail. We have taken on board\nthe recent remarks made by Hogg et al. (2010) and we turn\nto Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to 'fit' the\ndata. We use three different models; each one is discussed\nbelow.\nC1\n\nThe (Simple) Linear model\n\nThis model is described by Hogg et al. (2010) in their Eq.\n35. We assume that our data {xi , yi } with (normally dis2\ntributed) uncertainties {\u03c3xi , \u03c3yi } and covariance \u03c3xyi\n=\n\u03c1xyi \u03c3xi \u03c3yi come from a linear relation y = \u03b1x + \u03b2, with\nintrinsic scatter \u03c3I . Given a data point xi with uncertainty\n\u03c3xi we can define the expected frequency9 of observing the\ncorresponding data point in the range [yi , yi + y.] with uncertainty \u03c3yi given some particular model parameters {\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03c3i }\nas\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n\u22062i\np(yi |xi , \u03c3xi , \u03c3yi , \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03c3I ) = p\nexp\n\u2212\n2\n2\n2\n2(\u03c3di + \u03c3I )\n+ \u03c3I2 )\n2\u03c0(\u03c3di\n(C1)\nwhere\n\u2206i\n\n=\n\nvT .Zi \u2212 \u03b2 \u2032\n\n(C2)\n\nmeasures the perpendicular distance between the linear\nmodel and a data point because\nZT\ni\n\n=\n\n[xi , yi ]\n\nT\n\n=\n\n[cos \u03b8, sin \u03b8]\n\n(C4)\n\n\u03b2\u2032\n\n=\n\n(C5)\n\n\u03b1\n\n=\n\n\u03b2 cos \u03b8\nsin \u03b8\ncos \u03b8\n\nv\n\n9\n\nsee Hogg et al. (2010), note #13\n\n(C3)\n\n(C6)\n\n(C8)\n\nEqually, we could have introduced the rotated coordinate system of the linear model, Z \u2032 = [x\u2032 , y \u2032 ] which describe coordinates parallel and perpendicular to the regression line. They are related to the non-rotated coordinates\nby [x\u2032 , y \u2032 ] = R.[x, y] \u2212 \u03b2 \u2032 where R is the usual rotation matrix which depends only on \u03b8. There is an obvious equality\nbetween \u2206i and yi\u2032 . There is no need to persist with this\nrotated coordinate system here, but it will be useful in the\nnext section.\nThe likelihood of observing all our data points given a\nparticular choice of linear model is then the product of the\nfrequency distributions,\nLLM =\n\nN\nY\n\ni=1\n\np(yi |xi , \u03c3x,i , \u03c3y,i , \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03c3I ).\n\n(C9)\n\nStandard fitting procedures based on minimising \u03c72 or 'maximising the likelihood' then vary the model parameters to\nmaximise this expression and find the mode of the likelihood distribution. However, the Bayesian view on this is to\nsay that the posterior probability distribution of the model\nis\np(\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03c3I |{yi }N\ni=1 , Q) =\n\nL.p(\u03b1, \u03b2|Q)\np({yi }N\ni=1 |Q)\n\n(C10)\n\nwhere Q is shorthand for all the other (not always prior)\nknowledge of the problem, such as the xi , {\u03c3x,i , \u03c3y,i } etc.\nReaders familiar with Bayes Theorem will recognise all the\nterms above, but for the unacquainted, p(\u03b1, \u03b2|Q) contains\nadditional information about the problem (and is referred to\nas the prior) and p({yi }N\ni=1 |Q) is the normalising constant\nwe evaluate by insisting that our final posterior distribution\nis normalised to one. Note that maximising the likelihood is\nequivalent to maximising the posterior given uniform priors\non all parameters.\nMCMC samplers can probe the above likelihood with\ndifferent model parameters and provide a set of sample\npoints that are distributed according to the posterior probability distribution (PDF) because they were drawn from it.\nThis is our preferred method here, for two reasons. Firstly,\nit relaxes the standard assumption that the parameters are\nnormally distributed; while normality may be a good approximation for m and b, it is certainly not so for \u03c3I because \u03c3I \u2265 0, providing a hard (asymmetric) edge to the\nallowed distribution which we can set as a prior. Secondly,\nusing MCMC here in a relatively simple model prepares us\nfor more complicated models.\nIn terms of implementation, we use the PYMC library\n(Patil et al. 2010) to sample parameters \u03b8, \u03b2 \u2032 , \u03c3I using the\nstandard Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm. We choose\nrelatively unrestrictive priors that are flat but always over\na finite range: we let \u03b8 range between \u03b80 \u00b1 \u03c0/2 (where \u03b80 is\na good initial guess; this avoids searching for solutions near\nthe boundaries); the intercept (\u03b2 \u2032 ) is limited to a finite range\nbecause we can't sample to \u00b1\u221e; the intrinsic scatter (\u03c3I ) is\n\n\fData and 2D scaling relations for galaxies in Abell 1689: a hint of size evolution at z\u223c0.2\nnot allowed to be negative and also has some sensible upper\nlimit.\nWhenever we quote a best-fit or most probable value for\none of the parameters, we quote the median of the resulting samples (which by default is marginalised over all other\nparameters). The MCMC usually requires reasonably good\ninitial guesses to converge rapidly and such a guess can be\nprovided by the 'maximum likelihood' estimates or by eye.\nAs highlighted by Hogg et al. (2010), outliers can cause\nhavoc in this simple linear model and \u00a7C3 discusses our implementation of the solution proposed by those authors.\n\n27\n\n2001; La Barbera et al. 2003; Butkevich et al. 2005). In the\nKR and FJR, magnitude cuts have the effect of masking a\nregion of parameter space from being studied. In both cases,\nthe division between the unsampled and sampled regions can\nbe defined by a linear relation of the form y = \u03b1cut x + \u03b2cut .\nFor the KR,\n\u03b1cut\n\n=\n\n5\n\n(C16)\n\n\u03b2cut\n\n=\n\nmcut + 2.5log(2\u03c0)\n\n(C17)\n\n\u22127.5log(1 + z) \u2212 5log\n\n\u0012\n\nkpc\narcsec\n\n\u0013\n\nwhile for the FJR,\nC2\n\nThe (Complex) Double Linear Model\n\nIt is often the case when studying scaling relations that one\nwishes to compare the intercept or offset of one relation to\nanother. A common solution is to calculate the offset at a\nparticular value along the x-axis, but such a result is dependent on the different slopes assumed for the two relations\n(as well as their intercepts). Alternatively, if there is good\nreason to believe the slope of the relations hasn't changed,\none might fit the slope of the local relation (which usually\nhas more data) and then impose this fixed slope on the high\nredshift data (e.g. Barr et al. 2006); then at least there is\nno error created by imposing two different slopes, although\nthere is still a strong dependence on the slope itself, the\nintercepts and any internal scatter being derived.\nTo circumvent these problems, we propose a model conT\nsisting data drawn from two populations, Z1,i\n= [x1,i , y1,i ]\nT\nand Z2,i = [x2,i , y2,i ], each of which is described by a linear relation (as in \u00a7C1) but we constrain the linear relations\nto have the same slope \u03b1 and internal scatter \u03c3I ; we then\nlet the first population have intercept \u03b21 while the second\npopulation with intercept \u03b22 is offset to this by \u2206\u03b2, such\nthat \u03b22 = \u03b21 + \u2206\u03b2. In this way, the two linear models share\nthe same properties, except for the intercept and we have\nparameterised the variable we are most interested in as \u2206\u03b2.\nThe likelihood for this model thus far would be\nX\nX\np2,j\n(C11)\np1,i \u00d7\nLDLM =\ni\n\nj\n\nwhere\np1,i\n\n=\n\np2,j\n\n=\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u220621,i\n1\nq\nexp \u2212 2\n2\u03c31,i\n2\n2\u03c0\u03c31,i\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u220622,j\n1\nq\nexp \u2212 2\n2\u03c32,j\n2\n2\u03c0\u03c32,j\n\n(C12)\n\n(C13)\n\ngive the frequency distributions of the individual data points\nfor the two populations: \u22061,i =vT .Z1,i \u2212\u03b21\u2032 defines the residuals for the first population and \u22062,j similarly defines the\nresiduals for the second population; the expressions\n2\n\u03c31,\ni\n2\n\n\u03c32, j\n\n=\n\n2\n\u03c31,di\n+ \u03c3I2\n\n(C14)\n\n=\n\n2\n\u03c32,dj\n\n(C15)\n\n+\n\n\u03c3I2\n\ngive the total variances perpendicular to the relation. Hopefully the definitions of \u03c3I , \u03c31,di and \u03c32,dj are obvious to the\nreader from \u00a7C1.\nOne would also like to account for magnitude cuts and\nselection effects which are known to cause bias in the derived\nparameters (Willick 1994; Teerikorpi 1997; Saglia et al.\n\n\u03b1cut\n\n=\n\n0\n\n(C18)\n\n\u03b2cut\n\n=\n\nm + 2.5log(1 + z) \u2212 5logDL + 5\n\n(C19)\n\nThe ratio of the spectroscopic samples to the parent\nsamples as a function of m for both Abell 1689 and Coma\ncan be fit by a selection function of the form (Wegner et al.\n1996)\n\u0013\u001b\n\u001a\n\u0012\n1\nmi \u2212 mcut\n\u221a\nSi =\n(C20)\n1 \u2212 erf\n2\n2\u03b4m\nwhere erf is the error function, mcut is the position of\nthe cut (also the 50% completeness limit) and \u03b4m is the\nwidth/uncertainty of the cut (recall that Eq. C20 describes\na Heaviside step function at mcut convolved with a Gaussian with \u03c3 = \u03b4m ). We fit the selection function (Eq. C20)\nto the spectroscopic samples of Coma and Abell 1689 following the approach described in Wegner et al. (1996). For\nAbell 1689, using SExtractor magnitudes, we find that\nthe spectroscopic sample is consistent with selecting 60%\nper magnitude bin of the parent sample down to mcut = 19.5\nmag with uncertainty \u03b4m = 0.62 mag; for Coma, we find the\nspectroscopic data of J\u00f8rgensen et al. (1996) consistent with\nsampling 100% of the population down to mcut = 14.8 (AB)\nmag with uncertainty \u03b4m = 0.5 mag.\nWe model the magnitude cuts of the two samples in\na similar way to Saglia et al. (2001) and La Barbera et al.\n(2003) by scaling the frequency distributions (i.e. the pi ) by\na factor 1/fi to account for the parameter space masked by\nthe cut. This requires us to make an assumption about the\ndistribution of the data along the regression line which we\nassume is uniform, starting at x\u2032min = min(x\u2032i ) and ending at\nx\u2032max = max(x\u2032i ) thus having width L = max(x\u2032i ) \u2212 min(x\u2032i )\n(which is not a free parameter, but is set by the data and\nvalues of \u03b1 and \u03b2). Therefore the probability space masked\nby the magnitude limit as a fraction of the total probability\nspace is\n!\nZ x\u2032max\nZ y \u2032 =\u221e\n2\n1\ny\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u221a\nfi =\n(C21)\nx.\ny. exp \u2212 2\n2\u03c3i\nL\u03c3i 2\u03c0 x\u2032 =x\u2032\ny \u2032 =ycut\nmin\n\nwhere \u03c3i2 is again the total variance perpendicular to the\nrelation and we have evaluated the integral in the rotated\ncoordinates of the linear model, {x\u2032 , y \u2032 }. Eq. C21 can be\nsolved using the integral of the error function and substitut\u2032\n\u2032\ning the relation y \u2032 = \u03b1\u2032cut x\u2032 +\u03b2cut\nwhere {\u03b1\u2032cut , \u03b2cut\n} describe\nthe magnitude cut in the rotated coordinate system.

This accounts for the gradual\nnature of our magnitude cut.\nFor the Coma sample, there is no other obvious selection effect and Si accurately describes the ratio of the spectroscopic sample to its parent distribution as a function of\nmagnitude. However, the Abell 1689 data does suffer further selection effects which are not related to the magnitude\ncut above and should be corrected for. Firstly, only 60% of\ngalaxies were selected per magnitude bin on average. Furthermore, we sample more than 60% of the most luminous\ngalaxies due to low number statistics. Finally, we have the\nconstraint that the data which enters the KR and FJR must\nhave HST surface photometry, which further limits galaxies\nto be in the core of the cluster. Because of mass segregation,\nthis biases the sample to more massive (luminous) galaxies. We calculate the ratio of the ideal sampling (given by\nSi ) to the actual sampling as a function of m which can be\nused as a weight wi to correct for sampling effects, as in\nSaglia et al. (2001). Thus, accounting for the cut in magnitude with Si and fi , and additional selection effects as\na function of magnitude with weights wi , we can describe\nthe frequency distribution of a single data point, given the\nmodel parameters to be\n\u0014\n\u0013\u0015wi\n\u0012\n\u220621,i\nS1,i\n\u221a\np\u20321,i =\n(C26)\nexp \u2212 2\n2\u03c31,i\nf1,i 2\u03c0\u03c31,i\nThe final likelihood for the model is thus\nX \u2032\nX \u2032\np2,j\np1,i +\nL\u2032DLM =\ni\n\n(C28)\n\nwhereas model B is a simpler normal distribution\n\u0014\n\u0015\n(yi \u2212 Yb )2\n1\nexp\n\u2212\npmodelB = p\n2\n2\n2(\u03c3di\n+ \u03c3b2 )\n2\u03c0(\u03c3di\n+ \u03c3b2 )\n\n(C29)\n\npmodelA = p\n\nModel B is described by just Yb and \u03c3b , rather than any\nlinear relation: it's just a scattering of points across all x,\ncentred on Yb .\nWe want to be able to reject data points when constructing the likelihood. Hogg et al. (2010) explain how this\nis achieved by a summation over a mixture of the linear\ndistribution (model A) and the outlier distribution (model\nB)10 such that the likelihood for the model is\nL\n\n=\n\nN\nY\n\ni=1\n\n=\n\nN\nY\n\n[(1 \u2212 pb ).pmodelA + pb .pmodelB ]\n\n(C30)\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 \u2212 pb\n\u22062i\nexp\n\u2212\n2\n2\n2(\u03c3di\n+ \u03c3I2 )\n2\u03c0(\u03c3di\n+ \u03c3I2 )\ni=1\n\u0013\n\u0012\npb\n(yi \u2212 Yb )2\np\n+\nexp \u2212\n2\n2\n2(\u03c3di\n+ \u03c3b2 )\n2\u03c0(\u03c3di\n+ \u03c3b2 )\np\n\nwhere pb is (a single parameter for) the probability of any\ngiven data point being bad. We again 'fit' the parameters\n\u03b8, \u03b2 \u2032 , \u03c3I , pb , Yb , \u03c3b , via MCMC sampling. The main advantage being a less subjective approach to removing outliers:\nwe let the data and our knowledge of its uncertainty decide\nwhat to reject and what to keep. Again, the MCMC requires\nreasonably accurate initial guesses for the parameters to converge rapidly onto an acceptable result and such a guess can\nbe provided by the 'maximum likelihood' estimates or by\njust being sensible.\n\n(C27)\n\nj\n\nwhere the two sums sum over the data of the two different\npopulations.\nUsing the same MCMC set-up as before for this double linear model allows us to measure the marginalised offset between two scaling relations while fully accounting for\nmagnitude cuts and selection effects.\n\nC3\n\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n\u22062i\nexp\n\u2212\n2\n2\n2(\u03c3di\n+ \u03c3I2 )\n2\u03c0(\u03c3di\n+ \u03c3I2 )\n\n(C24)\n\nThe Mixture Model\n\nWe can also describe a scaling relation using a doubleGaussian mixture model (Exercise 14 in Hogg et al.) in\nwhich we again have data {xi , yi } with uncertainties\n{\u03c3xi , \u03c3yi } that come either from a linear relation (y =\n\u03b1x+\u03b2, model A, with intrinsic scatter \u03c3I ) or another outlier\ndistribution (model B with expectation value Yb and intrinsic scatter \u03c3b ) that overlaps that of the linear relation; thus\nbad data is modelled as coming from model B, whereas good\ndata is modelled as coming from model A. The goal is to determine which data is good, and which bad. Say we have N\ndata points and we don't know a priori which distribution(s)\nthe data points are drawn from, but we assume it's either\nA or B. Model A is described by a normal distribution just\n\nAPPENDIX D: ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank Inger J\u00f8rgensen for proposing the observations of\nAbell 1689, selecting the spectroscopic sample and for useful\ncomments which improved the paper.
