Introduction\n\nBy all appearances, the distance between the peaks\non the phase plane is almost constant in time, slightly\nvarying around the value \u2206\u03c8 = 0.40(0) depending on\nenergy (see Thompson et al. 1977; Wills et al. 1982;\nWhite et al. 1985; Nolan et al. 1993; Masnou et al. 1994;\nMoffett and Hankins 1996; Pravdo et al. 1997; Kuiper et al. 2001;\nBrandt et al. 2003; Rots et al. 2004; the MAGIC collaboration 2008).\nFor a long time it has been assumed that both peaks\nare perfectly lined up in phase over the whole energy range. This assumption has been disputed for\nthe first time in the work of Masnou et al. (1994).\nBased on the data of the FIGARO II telescope (balloon experiment), the authors found that the first peak\nin the 0.15 \u2212 4 MeV energy band is leading the radio\nmain pulse by \u223c 400 \u00b1 150 \u03bcs. Later, the misalignment in phase of the main radio pulse and the main\npulse in shorter wavelengths has been confirmed by\n\nThe Crab pulsar (PSR B0531+21) is the best studied isolated pulsar. The pulsed emission was discovered long ago and in the X-rays (Fritz et al. 1969;\nBradt et al. 1969) and in the \u03b3-rays (Kurfess 1971) domains. and its pulse morphology has been studied in\nthe full range of the electromagnetic spectrum. In all\nenergies, the pulse profile has two prominent features,\nthe main pulse (or the first peak, P1) and the interpulse\n(or the second peak, P2). The relative intensities of\nthese peaks depend on the energy band. The second\npeak dominates in the \u223c 200 \u2212 1200 keV energy band.\n1 Based on observations with INTEGRAL, an ESA project with\ninstruments and science data centre funded by ESA member states\n(especially the PI countries: Denmark, France, Germany, Italy,\nSwitzerland, Spain), Czech Republic and Poland, and with the participation of Russia and the USA.\n\n1\n\n\fseveral instruments. No absolute agreement exists in\nthe value of the radio delay measured by different instruments even for the same energy band, though they\nare close to each other especially if one takes into account not only statistical errors but also the possible\nsystematic uncertainties. The most recent measurements of the X,\u03b3-rays to radio lag are: RXTE/PCA -\n344 \u00b1 40 \u03bcs (Rots et al. 2004), JEM-X/INTEGRAL\n- 300 \u00b1 67 \u03bcs (Brandt et al. 2003), ISGRI/ and\nSPI/INTEGRAL - 285 \u00b1 12 \u03bcs and 265 \u00b1 23 \u03bcs, respectively (statistical errors only, Kuiper et al. 2003),\nEGRET/CGRO - 241 \u00b1 29 \u03bcs (Kuiper et al. 2003).\nThe INTEGRAL results mentioned above are based\non observations covering only several days, thus these\ndata can be folded with the single ephemeris record,\nwhile different ephemerides were used for RXTE\nand CGRO observations. That means that RXTE\nand CGRO results should be statistically more significant since they are less affected by uncertainties\nin the radio ephemerides (see Rots et al. 2004). Recently, the optical-radio delay has also been confirmed,\n255 \u00b1 21 \u03bcs (Oosterbroek et al. 2008).\nIn this paper we present the timing analysis of the\nCrab pulsar in the 2 \u2212 300 keV energy range with the\nSPI/INTEGRAL telescope and the RXTE instruments.\n\nZ\n\n12\n\n13\n\n11\n\n3\n\n10\n\n9\n\n2\n\nY\n14\n\n0\n\n4\n\n15\n\n5\n\n16\n\n7\n\n6\n\n17\n\n8\n\n1\n\n18\n\nFig. 1.- The shadowgram of the detectors plane of the\nSPI telescope in the simple case when only one source\nis located in the SPI FOV. The\"black\" colour corresponds to the area illuminated by the source ; \"Dark\ngrey\" to the area shadowed by the mask; \"Light grey \u2013\nto the area closed for the source by the collimator.\nThe combination of a good sensitivity to the continuum and line emission in the energy band 20 \u2212 8000\nkeV, provided by a large geometrical detector's plane\narea (\u223c 500 cm2 ) and cryogenic system, and a good\ntiming resolution (102.4 \u03bcsec) gives us an opportunity\nto study even very fast X/\u03b3-rays pulsars.\nThere are two main types of SPI events: single\nevents (registered by only one detector) and multiple\nevents (scattered photon detected by two and more detectors). Though the pulsating signal is clearly detected in both types of events, we did not use the multiple events because of difficulties in the extraction of\nthe spatial information, worse timing resolution and\nthe lack of a tested energy response matrix. It should\nbe noted that this kind of data was successfully used\nby Dean et al. (2008) for measuring Crab polarisation.\n\n2. Observations and data reduction\n2.1. INTEGRAL\nThe International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL; Winkler et al. 2003) was launched\non Proton/Block-DM on October 17, 2002 into a\ngeosynchronous highly eccentric orbit with high\nperigee (Eismont et al. 2003). The scientific payload of INTEGRAL includes four telescopes: the\nspectrometer SPI (Vedrenne et al. 2003), the imager\nIBIS (Ubertini et al. 2003), the X-ray monitor JEMX (Lund et al. 2003) and the optical monitor OMC\n(Mas-Hesse et al. 2003).\n2.1.1. The SPI telescope characteristics\nIn this paper, we focus on analysis of the SPI data.\nFor detailed description of the instrument calibrations\nand performance, see Vedrenne et al. (2003), Atti\u00e9 et\nal. (2003) and Roques et al. (2003). Below we give\nonly a brief review of the key characteristics of the instrument and software relevant for this work.\nSPI consists of 19 high purity germanium detectors\n(GeD) packed into a hexagonal array (see Figure 1).\n\n2.1.2. The SPI clock and time connection\nSPI has its own internal clock, a 20MHz oscillator\nthat generates time tag signal every 2048 periods, i.e.\n102.4 \u03bcs \u2013 the time resolution of the instrument. The\nSPI clock is synchronised with the on-board clock at\nevery 125 ms (the 8Hz on-board cycle, OBT 8Hz) by a\nreseting of the counter associated to the SPI oscillator.\n2\n\n\fThe SPI time tags are counted from the beginning of\nthe 8Hz cycle and divide the 125 ms interval into 1019\nintervals of 102.4 micro seconds duration plus one interval with a duration of 70 micro seconds. In fact,\nthe base frequencies of both on-board and SPI clocks\nare slightly varying with time (e.g. due to variation\nof the crystals temperature) that leads to variation in\nduration of SPI time tag intervals. We have estimated\nthis effect to be very small (< 5 \u03bcs for any statistically\nsignificant analysis), neglected it and used the nominal\nvalues of the frequencies. The on-board time (OBT)\nof the current 8Hz cycle is the value of the datation of\nthe beginning of the cycle (SPI User Manual - Issue\n5.2 - SEP 2002). By convention, the On Board Time\n(OBT) of any event is the time of the leading edge of\nthe interval where the event has been detected, that is :\nOBT = OBT 8Hz + Ntt \u2217 D/2\u221220 ,\n\nIn our analysis, to avoid an additional discretization in time series we decided to define the time of any\nregistered event not as the time of the leading edge of\nthe appropriate time tag interval, but as a linearly randomised time inside this time tag interval, and the final\nexpression for OBT is the following:\nOBT = OBT 8Hz + ((Ntt + rand[0, 1]) \u2217 D + \u2206T ) /2\u221220 ,\n(3)\nin this case \u2206T S PI = 0 and therefore \u2206T = +36 \u00d7\n10\u22126 s.\nTable 1: List of observations used in this analysis.\nObserving Period\nExp.a\nTarget b\nUTC\nks\nYEAR 2003\n0043\n19.177 \u2212 21.783 Feb.\n164\nCRAB\n0044\n22.163 \u2212 24.772 Feb.\n177\nCRAB\n0045\n25.167 \u2212 27.699 Feb.\n162\nCRAB\n0102\n14.623 \u2212 17.218 Aug.\n91\nCRAB\n0103\n17.610 \u2212 17.845 Aug.\n22\nCRAB\n0124\n19.430 \u2212 22.031 Oct.\n195\nIC443\n0125\n22.422 \u2212 25.023 Oct.\n196\nIC443\n0126\n25.414 \u2212 28.015 Oct.\n110\nIC443\nYEAR 2004\n0170\n5.122 \u2212 7.302 Mar.\n119\nCRAB\n0182\n9.987 \u2212 12.504 Apr.\n197\nIC443\n0184\n15.976 \u2212 18.566 Apr.\n222\nIC443\n0239\n27.435 \u2212 30.036 Sep.\n187\nCRAB\n0247\n21.363 \u2212 23.964 Oct.\n223\nIC433\nYEAR 2005\n0300\n28.910 \u2212 31.504 Mar.\n188\nCRAB\n0352\n31.463 \u2212 2.890 Aug/Sep.\n200\nA0535\n0365\n11.096 \u2212 11.938 Oct.\n59\nCRAB\nYEAR 2006\n0422\n28.729 \u2212 31.198 Mar.\n190\nCRAB\n0464\n1.252 \u2212 3.011 Aug.\n60\nTaurus\n0483\n28.711 \u2212 29.627 Sep.\n69\nCRAB\nYEAR 2007\n0541\n19.537 \u2212 22.128 Mar.\n213\nCRAB\n0605\n27.016 \u2212 28.927 Sep.\n154\nCRAB\nYEAR 2008\n0665\n24.473 \u2212 27.033 Mar.\n194\nCRAB\n0666\n27.463 \u2212 30.022 Mar.\n204\nCRAB\n0727\n25.940 \u2212 28.488 Sep.\n197\nCRAB\n0728\n28.932 \u2212 1.499 Sep./Oct.\n184\nCRAB\nYEAR 2009\n0774\n13.538 \u2212 \u221216.145 Feb.\n196\nCRAB\na\n\u2013 this value represents the total exposure of selected data\nb\n\u2013 for the complete description of the observations see the\nISOC site http://www.sciops.esa.int\nRev.\nNo\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Ntt is the number of the SPI time tag interval\n(0..1019) and D = 102.4 \u00d7 10\u22126 s is the length of the\ninterval. The divisor 2\u221220 is introduced to convert time\nexpressed in seconds to on-board time units and reflects the conventional time resolution of the INTEGRAL clock (the real clock accuracy is 2\u221219 seconds).\nFor the conversion of the On Board Time to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and for the barycentric correction we have used routines from the standard Off-line Science Analysis software package version 7.0 developed at INTEGRAL Science Data Centre (Courvoisier et al. 2003) and the time correlation\nfiles provided with the auxiliary data for the INTEGRAL data archive generation number 2. The equation (1) and the time transformation routines ensure\naccuracy of returning Universal Time of the order of\n100 \u03bcs.

(2003) is the sum of the first two\nterms (134 \u03bcs) of the expression (2).\n3\n\n\f2.1.3. Data selection\nIn our analysis we have used publicly available data\nof all observations where the source was in the FOV of\nthe SPI telescope. The exposure of selected data totals\nup approximately 4 Ms.\nSPI is a telescope with a coded mask aperture and\nmost INTEGRAL observations are organised as a set\nof snapshots of the sky around a target (pointings or\nScience Windows \u2013 continuous observations pointed\non a given direction in the sky). It means that the instrument effective area for the chosen target is changing from pointing to pointing. This effective area is\nmainly determined by geometrical area of the nonshadowed part of the detector plane (see Figure 1).\nTo extract the Crab pulsed signal we have used the\nepoch folding technique (Leahy et al. 1983). Any set\nof observations can be represented as a set of the whole\ndetector plane count rates and in these terms, the total folded curve is the direct sum of the folded countrates of the individual pointings. To reach the best\nresult we need to find an optimal series of the INTEGRAL pointings for which the signal to noise ratio will\nbe the highest one. In this regard, several parameters\ncharacterise each pointing: the exposure of the pointing, T i ; the background conditions \u2013 the instrumental\nbackground countrate plus the sum of the countrates\nfrom other sources in the FOV, Cib ; the illumination\nfraction of the detector plane, \u03b1i , corresponding to the\nsource direction (could include not only geometrical\nfactor, varies from 0 to \u223c 0.6); and the mean countrate\nof the pulsating part of the source emission, Cip (for\ncompleteness, below we are introducing also the term\nCidc - the mean unpulsating countrate of the pulsar, for\nthe Crab pulsar Cidc = 0). Using the terminology introduced above and assuming that all variances follow\nthe Poisson statistic, the signal to noise ratio for the\nsequence of M pointings can be expressed as follows:\n\n\u0012S \u0013\nN\n\nM\n\n= s\n\nM\nP\n\ni=1\nM\nP\n\n(Cib +\n\ni=1\n\nFig. 2.- The left panels show the distribution of the\nnumber of SCWs (a) or the number of individual detectors (b) versus their illumination fraction for our\ndata set. The function F(K) (see the equation (6)) is\nplotted on the rights panels for two cases: a) the whole\ndetector plane; b) individual detectors. Shaded areas\ncorrespond to the data that should be excluded from\nthe analysis. The function F in the case (b) is renormalised to be in the same units as in the case (a).\nM > 1000). Several simplifications have been investigated.\nConsidering that the INTEGRAL pointings (or Science Windows, SCWs) cover generally \u223c 2 \u2212 5 ks\ntime intervals, we can treat the exposure T i of individual member of the data series as constant, i.e.\nT i \u2243 const = T , i \u2208 [1, M]. Moreover, in the SPI\ntelescope, the background dominates the useful signal,\ni.e. (Cip + Cidc ) \u226a Cib is true for any point source excluding the brightest events like Gamma-Ray Bursts or\nshort intense bursts from Soft Gamma-Ray Repeaters\nand Anomalous X-ray Pulsars. Further, the amplitude\nof the variation of the SPI background does not exceed \u223c 50% of its mean level (excluding periods of\nSolar flares). So, we can treat Cib \u2243 const = Cb for\ni \u2208 [1, M]. We are assuming also that the mean value\nof the pulsar \"Pulsed\" component is constant in time\nCip \u2243 const = C p . Now, taking into account assump-\n\n\u03b1i Cip T i\n(4)\n\u03b1i (Cip\n\n+ Cidc ))T i\n\nThe optimal set of K pointings chosen from the initial set of M pointings is that for which the value of\n(S /N)K calculated using the equation (4) reaches its\nmaximum. In the case of a large number M the exhaustive search will take infinite time (even for M = 100\nthe number of combinations exceeds 1030 , in our case\n\n4\n\n\ftions listed above, we can modify the equation (4) as:\nM\nP\n\n\u03b1\nTC 2p i=1 i\n\n1.5\n\ns\n\n(5)\nM\nIn equation (5) we do not reduce the number of combinations in comparison with the equation (4) but now\nit is easy to see that the procedure of searching for the\noptimal set is equivalent to searching for the maximum\nvalue of the following discrete function:\n\u2243\n\nK\nP\n\nCb\n\n\u221a\n\nPhase\n\nM\n\n0.5\n\nN\n\n1.0\n\n\u0012S \u0013\n\n200\n\n600\n\n1000\n\n1400\n\nScience Window number\n\n\u03b2i\n\ni=1\n\nFig. 3.- Science window by Science window folded\ncurves in the 20-100 keV energy band.

In the latter case, \u03b1i\nis the illumination fraction of an individual detector\nand varies in the range 0 \u2212 1, and M is the number of\npointings times the number of the individual detectors\n(19 for SPI).\nWe have obtained the solution for our set of INTEGRAL observations for both cases as illustrated in Figure 2. To reach the maximum of the signal to noise\nratio in case I, we should exclude from the analysis the\npointings with an illumination fraction below 21%. In\ncase II, we should use only those detectors that have an\nillumination fraction above 38%. Figure 2, shows that\nusing individual detectors (case II) we obtain a \u2243 30%\nimprovement of the signal detection significance. In\nthis paper dedicated to the timing analysis, we have\nimplemented case II.\n\nthe edge of the validity intervals and those deduced by\nextrapolation are consistent with each other better than\n0.0001 in phase and 10\u22127 in frequency. The resulting\nephemerides for the INTEGRAL observing periods\nare given in Table 2.\nThe main pulse arrival time in the monthly ephemeris\nis determined with an error around 60 \u03bcs, that includes\nthe uncertainty in the delay due to interstellar scattering \u223c 20 \u03bcs (owing to the dispersion measure uncertainty \u2206DM \u223c 0.005 pc/cm3 ) as well as those arising\nfrom unknown instrumental effects \u223c 40 \u03bcs (see e.g.\nRots et al. 2004 and references there). While the first\npart can be treated as a statistical error that follows\nthe Poisson statistic and decreases with the number of\nindependent measurements, the second part should be\ntreated as a systematic error that is always present in\nthe measured values.\n\n2.2. Jodrell Bank Crab Pulsar Monthly Ephemeris\n\n2.3. RXTE\n\nFor the folding of the Crab pulsar lightcurves, we\nhave used the time solution derived from Jodrell Bank\nCrab Pulsar Monthly Ephemeris (Lyne et al. 1993)\nand the corresponding Crab Pulsar coordinates. The\ndatabase is available through the World Wide Web\n(http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/pulsar/crab.html) and contains the dispersion-corrected time of arrival of the\ncentre of the main pulse (in TDB time system), the frequency and its first derivative and the range of validity.\nFrom this database we extracted the radio ephemerides\ncovering the periods of the INTEGRAL observations.\nFor each radio ephemeris record we took its two neighbours and calculated the second derivative of the frequencies so that the phases and frequencies given at\n\nThe PCA instrument onboard the RXTE (Rossi Xray Timing Explorer) orbiting X-ray observatory consists of five identical proportional counters with a total\narea of 6500 cm2 , operating in the 2-60 keV energy\nrange (Bradt et al. 1993). The accuracy of the RXTE\nclock in absolute time for our observing time interval\n(2003-2009 yy.) is better than 2 \u03bcs (see Rots et al.\n2004 and references therein). Because of its large area\nand excellent time resolution and time accuracy, the\ninstrument is sensitive enough to reconstruct a significant 400 bins phase curve of the Crab pulsar using\nan exposure of the order of 1 ks. We used Crab PCA\nobservations that coincide in time (within two weeks)\n\n5\n\n\flight curves with the requested resolution (here we use\n400 bins per cycle). The middle of the zero bin is corresponding to the phase 0.0.\nAs a first step, to check our SPI data set for the\npresence of unknown \"glitches\" from the Crab pulsar\nor some instrumental artifacts (e.g. inaccuracy in the\non-board to Universal time conversion procedure) we\nfolded separately each SCW lightcurve in the broad\n20 \u2212 100 keV energy band. The result of the dynamical folding is presented on Figure 3, where we see that\nthe shape of the Crab phase histograms and absolute\nphases are very stable (the two peaks of the pulse are\ngood tracers).\nIn order to determine the phase of the hard X-ray\nmain pulse and interpulse more precisely and to study\npossible variations of these values in time we summed\nup the SCW folded curves for each revolution. The SPI\npulse profile for the Crab pulsar in the 20 \u2212 100 keV\nenergy band for the exposure \u223c 100 ks is presented on\nFigure 4. To define the phase of the pulses, we fitted\nthe data for each revolution with a composite model: a\nGaussian function plus a constant background, in the\nphase intervals 0.98 \u22121.01 and 1.38 \u22121.41 for the main\npulse and interpulse, respectively, and adopted the fitted position of the Gaussian centroid as the appropriate\nphase of the corresponding pulse. To make sure that\nthe fit results are model independent, we fitted the data\nfor the main pulse with two other models: Lorentzian\n- used in Rots et al. (2004) (due to the lack of statistic for the one revolution timescale we could not apply\nthe complete procedure of the peak-finding described\nin this paper) and Lorentzian plus constant - used in\nKuiper et al. (2003). We found that all three models yield similar values, with dispersion not exceeding\n0.0003 period (< 10 \u03bcs).\nThe absolute phases of the main pulse and interpulse (with respect to the radio main pulse) together\nwith the phase difference between them, as a function of the observation number, are shown in Figure\n5. The distributions of \u03a8P1 and \u03a8P2 values are well\nconsistent with normal distributions (\u03a8P2 \u2212 \u03a8P1 is not\na measured value but a combination of two independent functions). The mean value of the hard X-ray\nmain pulse phase is 0.99182 \u00b1 0.00046, thus, the pulse\nleads the radio main pulse by 8.18 \u00b1 0.46 milliperiods or 275 \u00b1 15 \u03bcs. Such quoted error does not include 40 \u03bcs coming from the uncertainty of the radio\nephemeris. The average value of the two pulses separation is 0.3989 \u00b1 0.0009 parts of the cycle. Note, that\nthis relative value is independent of any uncertainty in\n\nFig. 4.- Crab phase histogram in the 20-100 keV energy band in absolute phase with the phase resolution\nof 0.0025. \"1\" corresponds to the phase of the main\nradio pulse. Inner panels magnify the main pulse and\nthe interpulse peaks. Dashed vertical lines bound the\nintervals used for the fit procedure. The exposure is of\nthe order of 100 ks.\nwith any of our INTEGRAL observation and contain\ndata in the Generic event mode format with time resolution better than 250 \u03bcs. For the fine clock correction\nand barycenter correction we used faxbary script from\nthe FTOOLS package that calls the axBary code (see\ne.g. the RXTE Guest Observer Facility). For the folding procedure we use the same routine and the same\nephemerides as for SPI/INTEGRAL.\n3. SPI/INTEGRAL analysis and results\nTo perform epoch folding analysis we ascribe to\neach detected photon the phase \u03a8t using the appropriate ephemeris from the Table 2 and the following\nformula:\ndf 1\nd2 f\n1\n+ (t \u2212 t0 )3 2 (7)\n\u03a8t = \u03a80 + f (t \u2212 t0 ) + (t \u2212 t0 )2\n2\ndt 6\ndt\n2\n\nwhere t0 , f , ddtf , ddt2f is the radio ephemerides valid\nfor the moment \"t\" and \u03a80 \u2261 0 (we want to work in\nabsolute phase, i.e. the main radio pulse is at phase\n0.0). Then we can plot the phase values producing\n\n6\n\n\fFig. 5.- The best fit values of the main pulse (P1),\ninterpulse (P2) positions and distance between them\nin the phase plane versus the revolution number, in the\n20\u2212100 keV energy band.

The same radio ephemerides and\nfit procedure have been used. The horizontal dashed\nlines show the one sigma (statistical only) confidence\nintervals for the averaged values.\n\nthe radio timing ephemeris.\n\n(we provided the one sigma error) even taking into account that in this case the radio error does not play a\nrole since we used the same radio ephemerides for both\nmeasurements. Another quantity that is independent\nof any uncertainty in the radio timing ephemerides is\nthe phase difference between the main pulse and interpulse. From our set of PCA/RXTE observations,\nwe got a value of 0.40016 \u00b1 0.00028 that is in a\ngood agreement with the result obtained in hard X-rays\n(0.3989 \u00b1 0.0009, SPI/INTEGRAL).\n\n4. Comparison with PCA\nFor independent check of the hard X-ray results,\nwe carried out the analogous analysis in the 2-20 keV\nenergy band. We used the data of Crab observations\nwith the PCA monitor quasisimultaneous with INTEGRAL. We used the same radio ephemeris and the\nsame pulse definition procedure. The phase positions\nof the X-ray main pulse relative to the radio one for\n79 PCA/RXTE observations are shown in the bottom\npanel of Figure 6, showing that also the main X-ray\npulse leads the radio one. To determine the mean value\nof the time lag we approximated the PCA data with a\nconstant and got 0.00933 \u00b1 0.00016 in phase units or\n310 \u00b1 6\u03bcs in time. Again we are quoting only statistical errors but we keep in mind the systematic \u223c 40\u03bcs\nerror that comes from the radio ephemeris uncertainties. Based on two measured time lags \"X-ray/radio\"\nand \"hard X-ray/radio\" we can conclude that the main\nX-ray pulse is leading the hard X-ray main pulse by\n35\u00b116\u03bcs. This value differs only marginally from zero\n\n5. Radio delay evolution with energy\nWe have measured accurately the delays of the main\npulse arrival time in wide 2 \u2212 20 keV (soft X-rays) and\n20 \u2212 100 keV (hard X-rays) energy bands with respect\nto the radio main pulse arrival time. The 310 \u00b1 6 \u03bcs\nsoft X-ray/radio delay derived in this paper based on\nthe PCA data (Rots et al. 2004 provides even higher\nvalue 344 \u00b1 40 \u03bcs) is marginally higher than the radio\ndelay with respect to 275 \u00b1 15 \u03bcs hard X-ray/radio de7\n\n\flay measured with SPI. Both values are also slightly\nhigher of the radio/optical delay of 255 \u00b1 21 \u03bcs derived from S-Cam optical observations (Oosterbroek\net al. 2008) and the 241 \u00b1 29 \u03bcs radio/gamma one\n(> 30 MeV, EGRET, Kuiper et al. 2003). To check\nwhether this differences are real or not, we have made\nan additional analysis and investigated the behaviour\nof the radio delay with energy. The radio delay evolution with energy have been observed in optical wavelength (Oosterbroek et al. 2008), that gave us an extra\nmotivation. We have built folded curves in narrower\nenergy bands. We split the 2 \u2212 20 keV PCA energy\nband on three parts, while we used five energy channels to cover the 20-300 keV energy band for SPI data.\nWe also added the High-Energy X-Ray Timing Experiment (HEXTE/RXTE) data in four energy bands covering the 20 \u2212 250 keV energy range, allowing a direct\ncrosschecking with SPI results. The position of the\nmain peak has been determined as previously, from a\nfit with a composite model: a Gaussian function plus a\nconstant background, in the phase interval 0.98 \u2212 1.01.\nFigure 7 presents the evolution of the radio delay versus energy for the RXTE and SPI data, together with\nthe optical and \u03b3\u2212rays points from Oosterbroek et al.\n(2008) and Kuiper et al. (2003). The decreasing trend\nof the radio delay with energy in the (2 \u2212 300 keV)\nenergy domain supports the reality of the delay measured between the soft X- and hard X-ray main peaks,\neven though the individual error bars are large. When\nmodelling this decrease by a simple linear law (dashed\nline in Figure 7 ) we find that the radio delay decreases\nwith a rate of \u223c 0.6 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcs/keV. The obtained Chi2\nof 7.1 for 10 dof compared to the value of 42.4 for 11\ndof for a constant model corresponds to a probability\nof 3.5\u00d710\u22125 that its improvement is by chance.\n\nFig. 7.- The radio delay in function of energy. The\noptical (S-Cam) and \u03b3\u2212ray (EGRET) points are from\nOosterbroek et al. 2008 and Kuiper et al. 2003, respectively. The data of the RXTE instruments and SPI\nare from this work.\nIt is clear that the radio delay can not decrease linearly through the full gamma rays range, since the\nEGRET point imposes a positive value. Moreover,\ncontrary to we observe above 2 keV, the radio delay increases between optical and X-rays. It is interesting to\nnote that the X-ray delay is consistent with the rate of\n\u22125.9 \u00b1 1.9 \u03bcs/1000 \u00c5 derived from the 3920 \u2212 8230 \u00c5\noptical waveband by Oosterbroek et al. (2008).\nEven thought the dependence of the main pulse\nphase position on energy is complex, we can explain it with a rather simple scheme, where the pulsed\nemission consists of the superposition of two independent components having different phase distributions and energy spectra. Indeed, such an analytical model has been introduced by Massaro et\nal. (2000) to interprete the BeppoSAX data in the\n0.1-300 keV energy band (see also improvements\nMassaro et al. 2006; Campana et al. 2009). In the optical up to \u03b3\u2212ray domain, this model includes: an\n\"optical\", Co and an \"X-ray\", C x . The fractional part\nof the C x component increases in the main pulse with\nincreasing energy from 1 keV up to a 1 MeV, then decreases up to \u223c 10 MeV energy but is negligible below\n1 keV and above 10 MeV. C x /Co ratio behaviour fol-\n\n6. Discussion and conclusions\nWe have investigated the pulse profile of the Crab\npulsar between 2 and 300 keV with PCA/RXTE instrument and SPI/INTEGRAL telescope. We found\nthe strong indication that in this energy range the radio delay is significantly decreasing with energy. The\nsimplest explanation of such a behaviour is that the\nX \u2212 ray/\u03b3 so f t -ray emission originates in a region extended along the open magnetic field lines, with softer\nphotons originating at higher altitudes while the time\noffsets represent simply the path-length differences. In\nthis case, the time delay determines the characteristic\nazimuthal size of the emitting area as 54 \u00b1 18 km.\n\n8\n\n\flowing the same law as the Bridge/P1 ratio presented\nin Kuiper et al. (2001). Thereby, in the X-ray band,\nthe C x component shifts the maximum of the pulse I\n(C x + Co ) emission toward the radio maximum on the\nphase plane. It explains that the radio delay decreases\nwith energy in X-rays while it keeps identical values in\nthe optical and \u03b3\u2212ray wavebands where the C x component is negligible. Considering that the values of the\nradio delay are nearly the same in the optical wavelengths and \u03b3\u2212rays, where Co largely dominates over\nC x , we can suggest that the Co component corresponds\nto a single emission mechanism and emission location\nfrom optical to \u03b3\u2212rays. In this case, the \u223c 250 \u03bcs radio\ndelay indicates that the radio emission is produced in\na region located closer from the Neutron Star by \u223c 75\nkm than the Co production site. On the other hand, the\nC x component could be unrelated to the Co one, with a\ndifferent origin and/or source location. In this case, the\nsource behaviour in X-rays would result from a superposition of (at least) two independent components and\nthe measured values of the radio delay in this energy\nband would not have any direct physical explanation.\n\nCampana, R., Massaro, E., Mineo, T. and Cusumano,\nG. 2009, arXiv:0903.3655v1\n\nWe are grateful to Prof. Hermsen, Dr. Kuiper, Dr.\nRots and Dr. Revnivtsev for the very helpful technical\nnotes and discussion.
