Here we concentrate\non this type of networks with the world-wide Web as a\nprominent example, in which constantly updated links\nyield rapidly changing wiring diagram [1,10].\nOn the other hand, the occurrence of various universality classes-characterized by the same scaling\nexponents-suggests that only certain details of the microscopic dynamics are relevant for the universal scaling\nbehavior of complex networks, in analogy to critical behavior in physical systems in equilibrium [13]. Although\nthe theoretical background of the universality in complex\ndynamic systems and networks is still missing, numerical\nsimulations on specific models [10] and master equation\ncalculations [14\u201317] suggest that the following local properties (alone or in the appropriate combinations) of the\ndynamics are relevant for the emergent universal behavior: (a) Directed vs symmetric links (looked from a node\nin the network); (b) Fixed vs variable wiring diagram and\ntime scale of its variations compared to the growth time\nscale; (c) Type of preference linking; and (d) Presence of\nconstraints in the microscopic growth rules [18].\nRecently we have introduced a model of growing directed graph with bias updates and biased attachment\nof links, motivated by the conduct of agents in the real\nworld-wide Web [10]. It was shown that the model captures minimum relevant properties for the dynamics of\nthe Web, leading to a satisfactory quantitative comparison of the universal scaling quantities with the ones measured in the real Web [8]. The relevant control parameter\nof the model \u03b2, defined as the average ratio of updated\nand added links per time step (thus measuring the degree\nof rewiring in the graph) can vary in the range (0, \u221e).\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nIt has been recognized recently that the key role in the\ndynamics of complex systems is played by the evolving\nnetworks of various structures [1,2]. Evolution of complex\nnetworks representing catalytic reactions, cell metabolic\nprocesses, relaxation in disordered systems, protein folding, and realistic ecological, social, and information networks [1\u20138] are guided by variety of principles inherent\nto each particular network. Technically, the study of the\nevolving networks includes theory of graphs, as opposed\nto regular lattices, which are appropriate mathematical\nobjects in the study of driven cellular automata with diffusive dynamics [9]. Both, the dynamics of nodes and\narcs (links) contribute to the evolution of the network.\nThus, network growth implies that a complex architecture of links emerges, which is peculiar to the network,\nas an effect of the individual microscopic rules at work.\nMany complex networks self-organize into a scale-free\nstructures of links (for a recent review see [2]). The appearance of a scale-free structure is not accidental, having\nthat networks grow from stochastic rules, that assumes\ncertain degree of disorder on the microscopic scale. This\nrules result in the occurrence of dynamic fractal structures on the growth time-scale [10], which is then manifested in the emergent hierarchical organization of node\ndegrees at large evolution times. In growing networks the\npreference attachment such as in socially motivated linking, e.g., in science citation network [7], was shown to be\none of dominant mechanisms [11] leading to the scale-free\nstructure of links [2,12]. However, in many other growing\nnetworks the preference attachment alone has no capacity to take into account the intimate relationship between\nstructural complexity of the networks and their evolu1\n\n\fThe dynamic processes such as random walk specifically designed to the Web graphs reveal important information on network's relaxation upon triggering and\nsuggest how these networks can be efficiently explored.\nIn Ref. [19] we introduced a random walk with adaptive\nwalk strategy, that utilizes the locally available information on the underlying graph structure. In previous works\n[10,19] we have discussed the structure and dynamics of\nthe world-wide Web, representing a directed graph in this\nclass with rapidly changing wiring diagram: Estimated\n[10] value of \u03b2 \u223c 3 \u2212 4 from the scaling agreement with\nthe observed behavior [8].\nIn this work we extend the study to the entire class\nof graphs generated by varying the control parameter \u03b2\nin the physical range (0, \u221e). In the limit of extreme\nrewiring (\u03b2 \u2192 \u221e) some of the scaling features of the class\ndisappear. On the other end, for \u03b2 \u2192 \u03b2c (N ) <\n\u223c 0.1 the\ngraph undergoes a rigidity transition, where majority of\nlinks in the graph remains fixed in time. Among the networks between these two limits are the world-wide Web\nand networks representing a potential range of naturally\noccurring metabolic networks and catalytic reactions in\nopen environment [20]. Specifically, we study (1) how the\nglobal graph structure varies with the control parameter\n\u03b2 in the entire range before the rigidity transition, and\n(2) how these structural properties influence the relaxation of the network and the dynamics of the random\nwalk with variable walk strategies. In addition, study\nof the random-walk dynamics reveal how the local clusters participate in the global behavior of the graph. We\nbriefly discuss the potential application of the randomwalk path in communication processes on these class of\ngraphs.\nThe organization of the paper is as follows: In Sec. II\nwe present the growth rules of the class of Web graphs.\nWe grow large networks of 5\u00d7106 nodes to determine the\ndistributions of out- and in-degree for the range of values of the control parameter \u03b2. In Sec. III we define the\nadaptive random walk on this class of graphs and study\nthe structure of connected subgraphs scanned by an ensemble of such walkers, which we then compare with the\nstatistics of a standard random walk on the same graphs.\nIn Sec. IV we determine the survival probability distribution of these two types of random walk and their access\ntime to a given hierarchy level. Sec. V is devoted to a\nshort summary and conclusions.\n\nand subsequently creating and/or removing links in the\nentire network, that results in total increment M (t) links\nat time step t = i. Naturally, we take M \u2261 M (t) > 0,\nsuggesting that, in the average, the number of links increase at each time step. The links are updated in the\nfollowing way. An outgoing link originates from a node\nn < i with the probability\np1 (n, i) =\n\n\u03b1M + qout (n, i)\n,\n(1 + \u03b1)M \u2217 i\n\n(1)\n\nwhich is determined by the number of outgoing links\nqout (n, i) previously created at that node. The link points\ntowards the node k < i with the probability\np2 (k, i) =\n\n\u03b1M + qin (k, i)\n,\n(1 + \u03b1)M \u2217 i\n\n(2)\n\nwhere qin (k, i) is the current number of incoming links\ncollected at target node up to the step i. It is assumed that at the time of addition of a node i to the\nnetwork qout (i, i) = qin (i, i) = 0. In addition a fraction f0 (t) \u2261 \u03b1M (t) of new links are outgoing links from\nthe new added node i = t. Whereas the remaining\nf1 (t) \u2261 (1 \u2212 \u03b1)M (t) links are the updated links at preexisting nodes in the network. Hence, the relevant parameter in the model is the ratio of updated and added links\nat each time step, i.e., \u03b2 \u2261 f1 (t)/f0 (t) = (1\u2212\u03b1)/\u03b1, (independent of the actual increment M (t)), which measures\nthe degree of rewiring (or flexibility) of the graph. The\nEqs. (1)-(2) are motivated by the conduct of the agents\nwho create links in the real Web: A new link is is likely\nto be created by the most active agents in the network,\nand, similarly, the most probable target node will be the\none that already attracted many links. For consistency,\nwe use M = 1 throughout this work [21].\nThe numerical simulations in Ref. [10] demonstrated\nthat the rules in Eqs. (1)-(2) are compatible with the observed scaling behavior of the real Web, when the single\ncontrol parameter \u03b2 is set to a given value \u03b2 \u2248 3, corresponding to \u03b1 \u2248 0.2 within estimated error bars. The\ndynamically emerging out- and in-degree cumulative distributions are given by the power-law functions\n\u2212(\u03c4\n\nP (qout ) \u223c qout out\n\n\u22121)\n\n;\n\n\u2212(\u03c4in \u22121)\n\nP (qin ) \u223c qin\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nin the asymptotic region for large number of links (i.e.,\nlarge networks). The distributions are given in Fig. 1\nfor various values of the control parameter, showing the\n\u03b1-dependent scaling exponents \u03c4out and \u03c4in .\nThe asymptotic scaling behavior of the in-degree distribution that is generated by the shifted-linear preference rule in Eq. (2) with \u03c4in = 2 + \u03b1 was proved exactly in Ref. [14], that agrees completely with our results\nin Fig. 1. Recently, a similar analysis using rate equation approach was done in Ref. [16] for a directed graph\nin which in addition the probability of creating a link\n\nII. GROWTH AND STRUCTURE OF THE WEB\nGRAPH\n\nA directed Web graph is grown from the dynamic rules\nproposed in Ref. [10], which are based on the criteria\n(a)\u2013(c) listed above. (Potential effects of aging and other\nconstraints on the microscopic dynamic rules are left out\nof this work). A growth step is defined by adding a node\n2\n\n\fC(n, k) from the preexisting node n to node k depends\non the out-degree of the node n and in-degree of the\ntarget node k. It was demonstrated that when C(n, k)\nis given by a product of two shifted-linear functions of\nthe corresponding degrees, the emergent distributions of\nin- and out-degree are power-law type and statistically\ncorrelated [16]. According to the above rules in Eqs.\n(1)-(2), the probability for link creation C(n, k) in our\nmodel is C(n, k) = p1 (n, i) \u00d7 p2 (k, i), which is exactly\nthe type of function compatible with a double-power law\ndistributions for out- and in-degrees, in agreement with\nnumerical results in Fig. 1. Emergence of statistical correlations between in- and out-degree distributions is discussed in Ref. [10]. The model of Ref. [16] is slightly\ndifferent from ours, involving three parameters that can\nnot be reduced to a single control parameter, making it\ndifficult to extract an exact value of the exponent \u03c4out\nin terms of our control parameter \u03b2 (or \u03b1). The observed behavior shown in Fig. 1 suggests that \u03c4out increases approximately linearly with \u03b1 for 0.1 < \u03b1 \u2264 0.5\n(i.e., 9 > \u03b2 \u2265 1). However, \u03c4out increases rapidly in the\nregion below \u03b2 <\n\u223c 1/2, suggesting that the distribution\nof out-degree becomes exponential when the rigidity of\nthe graph increases towards a finite critical value. Note\nthat in the ideally rigid graph \u03b2 \u2261 0 the out-degree distribution is trivial: each node has exactly M links that\nremain fixed in time.\nStudy of the distribution of connected components\ndone in Ref. [10] suggests that for \u03b2 larger than some\ncritical value \u03b2 > \u03b2c (N ) a giant connected component\noccurs, similar to the real Web [8]. By decreasing the\ncontrol parameter \u03b2 the network structure changes gradually, eventually undergoing the phase transition into a\nstructure without a giant component [10]. The critical\nvalue of \u03b2 depends on the network size N and in the cases\nstudied here it is close to \u03b2c \u2248 1/12. Loss of scaling in the\nout-degree distribution at 1/3 > \u03b2 > \u03b2c (N ), while the\nin-degree still exhibits scaling behavior, demonstrates the\npower of cooperation in the network: Although the rules\n(1) and (2) formally look alike, the dynamical variations\nin qout (n, i) are due to local force, whereas the increase\nof qin (k, i) with time is made by a collective effect. Consequently, certain dynamical processes which are related\nto the out-degree structure might change their character\nbefore the network becomes rigid. Next we study random\nwalk processes on this class of graphs.\n\ndomly selected node, say node n. In the simple case, here\ncalled a naive random walk (NRW) for the reason to be\nclear soon, the walker moves along one of the qout (n, N )\noutgoing links of that node, selecting the link with equal\nprobability\nw(n) = 1/qout (n) ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere we write qout (n) \u2261 qout (n, N ), assuming for simplicity that the network does not grow during the walk\ntime. In this way the walker selects a target node, say\nk, and moves there making one time step of the walk.\nNote that this standard random walk on the graph of the\nstructure given in Eq. (3) is more complex compared to\nthe case of hierarchical graphs with a constant branching\nratio, in that it moves in an environment with variable\nstructure of the relevant out-degree. An adaptive random\nwalk (ARW), on the other hand, makes move selections\nwith the statistical weight, which is correlated with the\nlinking strategies of the visited node. In this case we assume that a link l from node n to node k has a weight\ndefined by\nwl (n) \u223c p2 (k, N ) ,\n\nq\n\nout\n\u03a3l=1\n\n(n)\n\nwl (n) = 1 ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere p2 (k, i = N ) is given in Eq. (2) with the normalization indicated in Eq. (5). Hence, the adaptive random\nwalker uses the same type of strategy that was used earlier by the visited node, thus moving preferably along\n\"hot\" links of the visited node. Note that the probability wl (n) is not identical to p2 (k, i) both because it is\nevaluated at a later time and it is normalized. In this\nway, the adaptive walker exploits full information about\nlocal graph structure, which is done by the out-degree\nof the visited node and in-degrees of all with that node\nconnected target nodes [22]. The naive random walker,\non the contrary, uses only the first part of information.\nAs a quantitative measure of different move strategies\nit is useful to consider the first-step statistics [23]. We\nshow in Fig. 2 the comparative statistics of the first jump\nof an ensemble of Na walkers with the naive and adaptive strategies, respectively, simulated on the same graph\nand using the same set of random numbers. It is shown\nin Fig. 2 that an adaptive search of the direction by the\nfirst jump is guided by the graph structure: the slope\nof the distribution of the first-jump distances (measured\nin node ranks) resembles the in-degree distribution. For\nthe ensemble of this size the out-degree distances made in\nthe first jump are correlated with the in-degree distances\nin view of Eq. (5). In the random search the distribution is still a power-law, however, the graphs structure\nis much less recognized (slope of the distribution of the\nfirst jumps is by one lower than the in-degree distribution of the graphs). Also much weaker, if any, correlations between in- and out-degree distances are observed.\nThe walker continues as long as it is visiting nodes with\nnonzero number of out-links qout > 0.\n\nIII. RANDOM WALKS WITH VARIABLE\nSTRATEGY\n\nWe define two types of the random walks: a standard\nrandom walk, and a walk that learns its strategies from\nthe information stored at a visited node on the graph, as\ndefined below. First we grow the graph of N nodes using\nthe rules in Eqs. (1)-(2), and then start a walk from a ran3\n\n\fA. Structure of connected subgraphs\n\nIV. SURVIVAL AND ACCESS TIME OF THE\nWALK\n\nA non-interrupted walk scans a set of connected nodes\non the graph. The set of visited nodes is thus a connected subgraph smaller than a connected component\nthat is usually searched by the Web crawl [8,10]. An\nensemble of random walkers thus can be used to scan the\nlocal structure of connected subgraphs, which in principle\ndiffers from the global graph structure.\nThe \"distance\" traversed by the walker on the graph is\nbest measured in the node-rank differences, i.e., distance\nin the levels of hierarchy, in which the graph structure\nis nontrivial. Spatial distribution of nodes is, in principle, random, whereas the temporal fractal structure [10]\noccurs on the growing time scale. In Fig. 3 we show\nthe time-integrated probability distributions of the noderank distances for adaptive random walk on the graph\nwith N = 104 nodes and varying the control parameter\n\u03b2. An ensemble of N = 20 \u00d7 104 walkers was employed.\nIn Fig. 4 the corresponding distributions obtained by the\nensemble of naive random walkers are shown that are\nsimulated in the same conditions as the adaptive random\nwalkers in Fig. 3.\nThe distributions of connected subgraphs found both\nby the ensemble of adaptive, W (\u2206q), and the ensemble of naive, R(\u2206q), random walkers are power-law type\n(\u03ba = out, in):\nW (\u2206q\u03ba ) \u223c (\u2206q\u03ba )\u2212\u03b4\u03ba ;\n\nR(\u2206q\u03ba ) \u223c (\u2206q\u03ba )\u2212\u03c1\u03ba .\n\nNext we study the survival probability of a walk and\nthe average access time of a walker to a given level of hierarchy. These properties are relevant for the relaxation\nof the graph and message passing to a given distance in\nhierarchy on the graph, respectively.\nThe access time is defined as a number of steps necessary for a walker to make a given distance here measured\nin the difference of the hierarchy levels of the departing\nand accessed node. In Fig. 5 the average access time normalized to the size of the ensemble Na is plotted against\nthe difference in the hierarchy levels between departing\nand visited nodes for two values of the parameter \u03b2 and\ndistances measured both by in- and out-degree. A remarkable feature is the power-law behavior of the access\ntime [19]. In general, the scaling form\n< tacccess >\u223c (\u2206q\u03ba )\u2212\u03b8\u03ba f (t/\u2206q\u03ba )\n\n(7)\n\napplies both for adaptive and naive random walks when \u03b2\nis large. However, the exponents \u03b8\u03ba (\u03ba stands for \"in,A\"\nand \"out,A\" for the adaptive and similarly \"in,R\" and\n\"out,R\" for random walk) are both larger than 2 in the\ncase of the adaptive search of the destination, whereas\n1 < \u03b8\u03ba < 2 for the naive random walk. Hence, apart\nfrom the small distances, the average access time of the\nadaptive random walk is much shorter compared to the\nstandard random walk. This makes the adaptive random\nwalk a good basis for its potential application as an efficient algorithm [26] for message-passing to a given level of\nhierarchy. In the case of catalytic reactions, this property\nof the adaptive random walk suggests that in the average\nfewer number of reactions occur along the path before a\ntargeted reaction at a given hierarchy level is reached.\nAccordingly, the survival probability, Ps (t) shown in Fig.\n6, represents two different types of relaxation processes\nfor large graph flexibility (large \u03b2): a nearly exponential\nrelaxation in the case of ARW, and stretch-exponential\nfor the NRW, respectively.\nThe difference between adaptive and random search for\nthe target gradually diminishes with increasing rigidity\nof the graph (i.e., decreasing the degree of rewiring \u03b2),\nmaking the wandering on the graphs similar in both cases\nwhen the critical point is approached \u03b2 \u2248 \u03b2c (N ). In Fig.\n6 we show the probability Ps (t) that a walk survives for\nt steps on the graph, when the control parameter \u03b2 is\nvaried. At the critical value (\u03b2c \u223c 0.081 for the graph\nsizes used in this simulations), the survival probabilities\nof the two types of walks almost coincide statistically. In\nthe limit \u03b2 = 0, i.e., when \u03b1 = 1 in Eqs. (1)-(2), each\nnode has exactly one out-link, rendering the both walk\nstrategies redundant. As we already pointed out, this\nlimit corresponds to the graph with fixed links, belonging to another universality class compared to the Web\ngraph that we discuss here.\n\n(6)\n\nDistinction between the respective distributions for inand out-degree distances are resembling the underlying\ngraphs structure. On the other hand, the difference in\nthe scaling exponents, for instance in \u03b4out and \u03c1out and\nsimilarly with \u03b4in and \u03c1in suggest that ARW and NRW\nare two qualitatively distinct types of processes. Namely,\nboth \u03b4out > 2 and \u03b4in > 2, whereas \u03c1out < 2 and\n\u03c1in < 2 indicating that the average distance in the case\nof the naive random walk diverges [24] with \u2206q \u2192 \u221e at\nN \u2192 \u221e, whereas the adaptive random walk remains in\nthe confined areas-distances, < \u2206q >< \u221e when N \u2192 \u221e.\nThese properties have important consequences, for instance for the disease spreading [25] along the random\nwalk path on the graph.\nIn the case of ARW the similarity between the\nW (\u2206qout ) and W (\u2206qin ) and the corresponding distributions in Fig. 1 in the scaling region is striking. By increasing the probability \u03b1 of a link outcoming from the newadded node, fast decrease of the distribution W (\u2206qout )\nin Fig. 3 makes the exponent \u03b4out difficult to measure\nfor \u03b1 > 0.6 . At a crossover value close to \u03b2 \u223c 1/3 the\ndistribution approaches the exponential form. At \u03b1 = 1\nall nodes have exactly one out-link, rendering this distribution trivial.\n\n4\n\n\fon the in- and out- node degrees. Summary of all scaling\nexponents for varying flexibility (or rigidity) of the graph\nis shown in Fig. 7. To understand the theoretical basis\nof these dependences an analytical study in terms of rate\nequations of the random-walk dynamics is necessary.\n(3) By increasing the graphs rigidity (reducing degree\nof rewiring \u03b2) the advantage of the strategy \"reading full\ninformation on the way\" is lost: Survival of the adaptive\nrandom walk becomes statistically closer to the one of the\nnaive walk strategy; Access time gradually approaches\nthe Poisson character; At a critical flexibility \u03b2c <\n\u223c 0.1 the\ngraph structure undergoes the rigidity percolation transition to another universality class characterized with predominantly fixed wiring diagram, in which the random\nwalk dynamics becomes trivial.\n(4)The other limit \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e, representing the extreme\nflexibility, is formally interesting as a possible course of\nthe world-wide Web evolution. In this limit the evolving network at each growth stage shares some similarity\nwith the static random graphs! We detect certain numerical instability in the distributions that can be related to the changes in the linking probabilities Eqs.\n(1)-(2) when \u03b1 \u2192 0. After a large number N1 nodes\nare added, these probabilities are N1 -dependent as p\u03ba \u223c\n(1\u22121/\u03c4\u03ba)\n\u03b1/(1+\u03b1)N1 +1/(1+\u03b1)N1\n, where we assumed that\nmaximum degree varies with the network size approxi1/\u03c4\nmately as q\u03ba \u223c N1 \u03ba , (as before, \u03ba stands for \"in\" or\n\"out\"). In the random-graph theory the leading inverse\nlinear term of linking probability is compatible with the\noccurrence of cycles (i.e., triangles, squares, pentagons,\netc.) of all sizes, whereas the additional inverse sublinear\nterm introduces admixture of full graphs [28]. By letting \u03b1 \u2192 0 the leading linear term disappears, inducing\nsudden change in the structure of subgraphs-now being\nonly full graphs. Now, having \u03c4in \u223c 2 for small \u03b1 leads to\n1/2\npin \u223c 1/N1 , that is compatible with the occurrence of\nfully connected pentagons. Whereas \u03c4out \u223c3\u20132.5, leading\n2/3\nto pout \u223c 1/N1 \u20131/N 3/5 allowing appearance of at most\nfully connected squares. This suggests why the exponent\nof the out-degree should stay larger than the one of indegree distribution when \u03b1 \u2192 0. Numerical simulations\nsuggest (see Fig. 7) that \u03c4out \u2192 2.5, whereas \u03c4in \u2192 2 in\nthis limit.\nRandom walk path may serve as a communication\nchannel in modeling of packet transport on this class of\ngraphs. In addition to channels, the communication processes depend on the properties of packets to be transported and of driving rate resulting in load at individual\nnodes. By varying these parameters on a hierarchical tree\nit was shown in Ref. [29] that a continuous transition to\na congested regime occurs, that exhibits several universal features. Looked in this context, our study concentrates on the properties of the communication channels\nonly, and we do not specify any details on the character\nof packets. The simulation conditions thus correspond\n\nV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have studied a class of directed graphs with variable wiring diagram caused, for instance, by frequent updates of the out-links in the world-wide Web while the\ngraph evolves. The relevant control parameter that defines the class is the average ratio of updated vs. fixed\nlinks, \u03b2 \u2261 (1 \u2212 \u03b1)/\u03b1. In the case of the Web \u03b2 is estimated [10] in the range 3\u20134, i.e., to each added link\nin the Web comes in the average 3 to 4 links that connect preexisting nodes at each time step of the evolution.\nOther members of this class of graphs can be sought in\nthe catalytic biochemical reactions, in which nodes are\nsubstrates (such as ATP, CO2 , H2 O, etc.) and links are\nreactions among these substrates [1,2,19]. Since the backward reactions, although present, are usually driven by\nmuch smaller rates than forward reactions [27], the biochemical reactions are represented by directed hierarchical graphs, with ATP as a top connected node. The presence of catalysts or enzymes selects appropriate reaction\nwith a high accuracy. Investigations and potential applications of catalytic reactions among complex molecules\nis a great challenge of sciences in the future [20]. The\ncontrol parameter in this case can be roughly identified\nas the concentration of the catalyst, that can vary depending on the type of the reactants and/or catalyst.\nHere we investigated within the growth model of Ref.\n[10] how the structure of the out- and in-connections\nof the graph vary with the control parameter and how\nthat structure influences the relaxation processes on the\ngraph. We summarize the properties that appear as direct consequences of the flexibility of the graph:\n(1) In addition to in-degree, the out-degree distribution\nappears to be a power-law distribution with a new scaling exponent; Correlations between out- and in-degree\nspontaneously develop;\n(2) These structural properties of the graphs determine the properties of the random walks on these graphs.\nRichness of the doubly-hierarchical connections allows\nus to define various types of the random walk strategies. Specifically, the adaptive random walker fully utilizes local information on both in- and out-connectivity\nof a visited node and adapts its moves to follow the node\nlinking preferences. On the other hand, a standard random walker makes use of the out-degree of a visited node\nsearching only the possible ways out. For large graph\nflexibility the adaptive strategy proves effective in the\nsearch of connected subgraphs and in reducing the access time to a given hierarchy level. Quick relaxation of\nthe graph represented by the ARW path in this range\nof parameter indicates a short list of reactions before a\ntargeted reaction occur.\nThe dynamic processes on this class of graphs reflect\nthe underlying graph structure, leading to a variety of\nscale-free properties with distinct functional dependences\n5\n\n\fto idealized low driving rate below the transition point.\nApart from the occurrence of cycles (closed loops), the\nWeb graph differs from the hierarchical tree in that linked\nnodes are preferably at large distances of hierarchy, in\ncontrast to the tree structure where only next hierarchy\nlevels are coupled. We have demonstrated that due to the\ncomplex double-hierarchical structure of the Web graph\nthe channel selection can be done using various strategies,\neach of them resulting in a nontrivial statistical properties of the channels. How these channel properties would\ninfluence the communication processes when more realistic packets and driving conditions are considered remains\nfor the future study.\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated that flexible\nwiring diagrams in the class of directed graphs induces a\nnumber of structural and relaxation properties that are\ncrucial both for evolution of these graphs and for design\nof dynamic processes for exploring their structure.\n\n[15] S.N.
