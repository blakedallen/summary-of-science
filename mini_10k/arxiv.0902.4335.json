We demonstrate the existence of stochastic resonance (SR) in confined systems arising from\nentropy variations associated to the presence of irregular boundaries. When the motion of a Brownian\nparticle is constrained to a region with uneven boundaries, the presence of a periodic input may give rise\nto a peak in the spectral amplification factor and therefore to the appearance of the SR phenomenon. We\nhave proved that the amplification factor depends on the shape of the region through which the particle\nmoves and that by adjusting its characteristic geometric parameters one may optimize the response of\nthe system. The situation in which the appearance of such entropic stochastic resonance (ESR) occurs\nis common for small-scale systems in which confinement and noise play an prominent role.

This resonant phenomenon, observed in general in the wide class of periodically modulated noisy systems, was termed stochastic resonance and constituted a\nparadigm shift in the way we think about noise effects in\nsystems away from equilibrium [1]. In this new paradigm,\nthe presence of noise does not always constitute a nuisance; on the contrary, it may play a constructive role\n[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12].\nUp to now, the phenomenon of SR has been observed\nmainly in systems dominated by the presence of a purely\nenergetic potential or possessing some dynamical threshold [1]. However, when scaling down the size of a system, the free energy rather than the internal energy becomes the most appropriate potential, and there are cases\nin which changes in the free energy are mainly due to\nentropy variations [11,13,14,15,16,17,18]. This is what occurs in constrained systems. In the case of a Brownian\nparticle moving in a confined medium, entropy variations\ncontribute to changes in the free energy and may under some circumstances become its leading contribution\n[12,13,17,18]. We will show in this work that the unevenness may also give rise to a stochastic resonance effect\nand that this effect can be controlled upon variation of\n\nthe geometrical parameters, characterizing the shape of\nthe cavity in which the Brownian particle dwells.\nUsually, the analysis of SR effects have been performed\nby means of pertinent Langevin or corresponding FokkerPlanck models [19,20]. In confined systems the presence of\nboundaries exerts a strong influence in the dynamics and\none has to solve the corresponding boundary value problem. This task cannot always be easily achieved. The fact\nthat in many instances boundaries are very intricate enormously complicates the mathematical treatment of the\nproblem to the extent of becoming a Herculean task when\nthe boundaries are extremely irregular [21]. This feature\ndemands the implementation of different approaches entailing a simplification of the analysis [22,23,24]. Among\nthem, the Fick-Jacobs equation, based on a coarsening of\nthe description in terms of a single, relevant coordinate degree of freedom, accurately performs this task [17,18,21,22,23].\nThis methodology will guide us in this article to analyze\nthe appearance of the SR effect in presence of unevenness.\nThe article is organized in the following way. In Section 2, we introduce a model for Brownian motion in a\nconfined medium. In Section 3, we present a reduction\nmethod which simplifies the complex nature of the 3D/2D\ndynamics giving rise to an effective one-dimensional kinetic description. Section 4 is devoted to evaluate the transition rate from the reduced kinetic description, and the\nintroduction of spectral amplification within the two-state\napproximation. In Section 5, we present the results showing the ESR phenomenon. The impact of the geometrical\nshape and confinement on the spectral amplification is\n\n\f2\n\nBurada et al.: Entropic Stochastic Resonance\n\nG\n\nb\n\nF(t)\n\nLy\n\ny\nLx\n\nx\n\nFig. 1. Schematic illustration of the two-dimensional structure\nconfining the motion of the Brownian particles. The symmetric structure is defined by a quartic double well function, cf.\nEq. (2), involving the geometrical parameters Lx , Ly and b.\nBrownian particles are driven by a sinusoidal force F(t) along\nthe longitudinal direction and a constant force G in the orthogonal direction.\n\ndiscussed in Section 6. Finally, we summarize our main\nconclusions in Section 7.\n\nThe dynamics of a particle in a constrained geometry subjected to a sinusoidal oscillating force F (t) along the axis\nof the structure and to a constant force G acting along\nthe orthogonal, or transverse, direction can be described\nby means of the Langevin equation written, in the overdamped limit, as\np\ndr\n= \u2212Gey \u2212 F (t)ex + \u03b3 kB T \u03be(t) ,\ndt\n\n(1)\n\nwhere r denotes the position of the particle, \u03b3 is the friction coefficient, ex and ey the unit vectors along x and ydirections, respectively, and \u03be(t) is a Gaussian white noise\nwith zero mean which obeys the fluctuation-dissipation\nrelation h\u03bei (t) \u03bej (t\u2032 )i = 2 \u03b4ij \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) for i, j = x, y. The\nexplicit form of the longitudinal force is given by F (t) =\nF0 sin(\u03a9t) where F0 is the amplitude and \u03a9 is the angular\nfrequency of the sinusoidal driving.\nIn the presence of confinement, this equation has to\nbe solved by imposing reflecting (no-flow) boundary conditions at the walls of the structure. For the 2D structure\ndepicted in Fig. 1, the walls are defined by\nwl (x) = Ly\n\n\u0012\n\nx\nLx\n\n\u00134\n\n\u2212 2 Ly\n\n\u0012\n\nx\nLx\n\n\u00132\n\n\u221a\ndr\n= \u2212Gey \u2212 F (t)ex + D \u03be(t) ,\ndt\nwl (x) = \u2212wu (x) = \u01ebx4 \u2212 2\u01ebx2 \u2212 b/2 ,\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nwhere we defined the aspect ratio \u01eb = Ly /Lx and the\nrescaled temperature D = T /TR .\n\n2 Confined Brownian motion\n\n\u03b3\n\nvery close to the lower boundary of the structure, recovering the effect of an energetic bistable potential. For the\nsake of a dimensionless description, we measure all lengths\nin units of Lx , i.e. x\u0303 = x/Lx , \u1ef9 = y/Lx implying b\u0303 = b/Lx\nand w\u0303l = wl /Lx = \u2212w\u0303u , temperature in units of an arbitrary, but irrelevant reference temperature TR and time\nin units of \u03c4 = \u03b3L2x /kB TR , that is, twice the time the particle takes to diffuse a distance Lx at temperature TR , i.e.\nt\u0303 = t/\u03c4 and \u03a9\u0303 = \u03a9\u03c4 . We scale forces by FR = \u03b3Lx /\u03c4 , i.e.\nthe orthogonal force reads G\u0303 = G/FR and the sinusoidal\nforce F\u0303 (t\u0303) = F (t)/FR . For better legibility, we shall omit\nthe tilde symbols in the following. In dimensionless form\nthe Langevin-equation (1) and the boundary functions (2)\nread:\n\n\u2212\n\nb\n= \u2212wu (x) , (2)\n2\n\nwhere wl and wu correspond to the lower and upper boundary functions, respectively. The characteristic length Lx\nrefers to the distance between the bottleneck and the position of maximal width, Ly corresponds to the narrowing\nof the boundary functions and b to the remaining width at\nthe bottleneck, cf. Fig. 1. Consequently, the local width of\nthe structure reads: 2 w(x) = wu (x) \u2212 wl (x). This particular choice of the geometry is intended to resemble the classical setup for SR in the context of energetic barriers. In\nfact, in the limit of a sufficiently large transverse force G,\nthe particle is in practice restricted to explore the region\n\n3 Reduction of dimensionality\nSince the above mentioned dynamics given by Eq. (3) with\nthe boundary conditions could not be solved analytically,\nwe simplified the problem by assuming equilibration in ydirection and thereby reducing the dimensionality of the\nproblem [22,23,24,25].\nFirst, we consider the case in the absence of the periodic forcing, i.e. F (t) = 0. Then, the 2D dynamics is described by the following 2D Smoluchowski equation [20,19]\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\nP (x, y, t) = D e\u2212U(x,y)/D eU(x,y)/D P (x, y, t)\n\u2202t\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+ D e\u2212U(x,y)/D eU(x,y)/D P (x, y, t) , (5)\n\u2202y\n\u2202y\nwith reflecting boundary conditions at the confining walls\nand where the potential function is given by U (x, y) =\nG y. Since we are mainly interested in the dynamics in xdirection, we introduce the marginal probability density\nP (x, t) which is obtained by integration over the transverse coordinate:\nZ\nP (x, t) = dy P (x, y, t) .\n(6)\nOn integrating Eq. (5) over the transverse direction, we\nget\n\u2202\nP (x, t) =\n\u2202t\n\u001b\n\u001a\nZ\n\u2202\n\u2202\nD\ndy e\u2212U(x,y)/D eU(x,y)/D P (x, y, t) .\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\n(7)\n\nAssuming local equilibrium in the y-direction, we define\nthe x-dependent effective energy function A(x) (omitting\n\n\fBurada et al.: Entropic Stochastic Resonance\n\nirrelevant constants) reading\nZ\ne\u2212A(x)/D = dy e\u2212U(x,y)/D .\n\n2\n(8)\n\ne\n\n,\n\nP (x, y, t) \u223c\n= P (x, t)\u03c1(y; x) ,\n\n(10)\n\nand the kinetic equation for the marginal probability distribution, cf. Eq. (7), becomes\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\nP (x, t) \u223c\n= D e\u2212A(x)/D eA(x)/D P (x, t) .\n\u2202t\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\n= \u2212D ln\n\ne\u2212G y/D dy\n\nwl (x)\n\nD \u0010 \u2212Gwl (x)/D\ne\n\u2212 e\u2212Gwu (x)/D\nG\n\n. (12)\n\nMaking use of the symmetry of our considered structure,\ni.e. wu (x) = \u2212wl (x) and the definition of the half width\nfunction w(x) = (wu \u2212 wl )/2, the potential function turns\ninto\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0014\nGw(x)\n2D\n.\n(13)\nsinh\nA(x) = \u2212D ln\nG\nD\nEq. (11) can then be rewritten as\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u2202P (x, t)\n\u2202P\n\u2202\nD\n=\n+ A\u2032 (x) P ,\n\u2202t\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\nD = 0.25\n\n0.5\n0\n\u22120.5\n0\n(c)\n\nD = 0.005\n\n\u22120.1\n\nwu (x)\n\n\u0011\u0015\n\n1\n\n(11)\n\nIn the present case with a constant force G in the negative\ny-direction the potential function A(x) reads, cf. Eq. (8):\n\"Z\n#\n\u0014\n\n(b)\n\n(9)\n\nand is normalized for every x. As a result, the two dimensional probability distribution can be approximately\nexpressed as\n\nA(x) = \u2212D ln\n\nD = 0.5\n\n0\n\nA(x)\n\n\u03c1(y; x) = e\n\n(a)\n1\n\nConsequently, the conditional local equilibrium probability distribution of y at a given x becomes\n\u2212U(x,y)/D A(x)/D\n\n3\n\n(14)\n\nwith the potential function A(x) given by Eq. (12) (or by\nEq. (13) for wl (x) = \u2212wu (x)) and with the prime referring to the derivative with respect to x. In general, after\nthe coarse-graining the diffusion coefficient will depend on\nthe coordinate x, but since in our case |w\u2032 (x)| \u226a 1, the\ncorrection can be safely neglected [21,23,24,25,26].\nIt is important to highlight that the potential A(x) was\nnot present in the 2D Langevin dynamics, but arises due\nto the entropic restrictions associated to the confinement.\nThen, equation (14) describes the motion of a Brownian\nparticle in a free energy potential of entropic nature, as\nA(x) does not only depend on the energetic contribution of\nthe force G, but also on the temperature D and the geometry of the structure in a non-trivial way. For a structure\nlike that depicted in Fig. 1, the free energy A(x) forms a\ndouble-well potential, cf. Fig. 2. As the width at the bottleneck of the channel approaches zero, the potential A(x)\ndiverges.\nIt is worth to analyze the two limiting situations that\ncan be obtained depending on the transverse force G.\n\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.3\n\u22121\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\nx\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nFig. 2.

(Color online) A detailed comparison of the behavior of the spectral amplification factor obtained numerically\nfrom the 1D modeling (solid line), cf. Eq.(23) and Eq.(25),\nand within the two-state approximation (Eq.(22)), using either\nthe Kramers-Smoluchowski rate (K) (dotted line) or the rate\nobtained directly from the mean first passage time (MFPT)\n(dashed-line). Here, the transverse force is G = 1.0, and the\nstructure is defined by Eq. (4) with an aspect ratio \u01eb = 1/4,\nand a bottleneck width b = 0.02.\n\nthe entropic potential barrier takes place and was reported\npreviously in Ref. [18]. Under these circumstances and in\nthe presence of a finite orthogonal, i.e. transverse force G,\nincreasing the noise level results in a noise-amplified response signal. The improvement of the response is quantified in the following by the spectral amplification factor \u03b7,\nwhich is the ratio of the power stored in the response of the\nsystem at the driving frequency \u03a9 and the power of the\nsinusoidal driving signal. The occurrence of the Entropic\nStochastic Resonance effect manifests in the presence of an\noptimal dose of noise for which the spectral amplification\nis maximal [18].\n\nBy spatial discretization, using a Chebyshev collocation method, and employing the method of lines, we reduced the kinetic equation to a system of ordinary differential equations, which was then solved using a backward\ndifferentiation formula method [31]. As a result, we obtained the time dependent probability distribution P (x, t)\nand, from that, the time-dependent average position defined as\nZ\nhx(t)i = x P (x, t)dx ,\n(24)\nwhich was computed in the long-time limit. After a Fourierexpansion of hx(t)i one finds the amplitude M1 of the\nfirst harmonic of the system's response.

Fig. 4, indicating the existence of a Stochastic\nResonance effect: there is a maximum of the spectral amplification at an optimal value of noise. The qualitative\nbehavior is captured by the two-state approximation as\nwell. The prediction of the two-state modelling with rates\nevaluated directly from MFPT is closer to the 1D modelling than those obtained by making use of the Kramers5.1 Two-State modeling\nSmoluchowski approximated rate, as illustrated in Fig. 4.\nThis is due to the fact that the condition \u2206A \u226b D is\nIt is straight forward to derive an analytic expression for\nnot always fulfilled in this case.

It is also worth to point out that\nstarting out from a finite G-value the position of the ESR\npeak shifts towards smaller noise strengths as G decreases\nwhile the maximum value increases, cf. Fig. 5. A comparison between the 1D-modelling and the full 2D simulation\nis depicted in Fig. 6. The 2D simulation results convincingly corroborate the validity of the modelling within the\n1D Fick-Jacob approximation, see also below.\nThus, we detect a non-monotonic behavior of the spectral amplification only for finite values of the orthogonal\nforce G 6= 0, while for G = 0 the spectral amplification decays monotonically. In other words, for the dynamics and\nsituation considered in Sec. 2 the occurrence of the ESReffect requires a non-vanishing orthogonal force G which\ncontributes within the 1D modelling to the effective entropic potential.\n\nFig. 7.

Like in Fig. 6, in the deterministic limit (D \u2192 0),\nthe spectral amplification reaches the limiting value (1/\u03a9 2 ) for\nG = 0.\n\nstructure defined by Eq. (26). Again, the effective potential function A(x) obtained from the Fick-Jacobs approximation exhibits a large potential barrier separating the\ntwo basins each of which is additionally separated by a\nsmaller potential barrier into two wells. In fact, the construction of the alternative geometric structure was done\nin such a way to reveal the existence of a main entropic\nbarrier controlling the transitions between the two main\nbasins.\nThe behavior of spectral amplification as a function of\nthe noise strength for the new channel defined by Eq. 26,\nand for two different values of the transverse force is depicted in Fig. 8. Interestingly, we can observe the existence\nof Entropic Stochastic Resonance even in the new structure, when the transverse force is present in the system.\nComparing the results of Fig. 8 for the channel depicted\nin Fig. 7 with those in Fig. 6, one can observe that the\nESR peak appears at higher values of the noise strength.\nIn addition, the enhancement of the signal upon increasing the noise is more pronounced in the new structure.\nThese results suggest that by a proper design of the geometry of the channel it would be possible to significantly\nenhance and optimize the response of a confined system.\nThis would be specially important in biological systems,\nwhere the noise (i.e. the temperature) is a variable that\ncan neither be arbitrarily chosen nor eliminated. Finally,\nit is also worth stressing that the Fick-Jacobs approximation still holds nicely in this case since the 2D numerical\nsimulation results are in very good agreement with those\nobtained by 1D modelling.\nOverall, the results indicate that the existence of a\nsmall bottleneck separating two basins and forming an\neffective entropic potential barrier, leads robustly to the\noccurrence of an Entropic Stochastic Resonance effect.\n\nWe have shown that unevenness may be the origin of\nmany resonant phenomena in small-scale systems. The\nconstrained motion of a Brownian particle in a region\nlimited by irregular boundaries impedes the access of the\nparticle to certain regions of space giving rise to entropic\neffects that can effectively control the dynamics. The interplay between the noise present in the system, the external modulation and the entropic effects results in an\nentropic stochastic resonance. However, the presence of a\ntransverse force G is crucial to observe this resonant behavior. This ESR is genuine of small scale systems where\nconfinement yields entropic effects. The occurrence of ESR\ndepends on the shape of the channel and can then be controlled by it. Thus understanding the role of noise and\nconfinement in these systems does provide the possibility for a design of stylized channels wherein response and\ntransport become efficiently optimized.\nThis work has been supported by the DFG via research\ncenter, SFB-486, project A10, the Volkswagen Foundation (project I/80424), the German Excellence Initiative\nvia the Nanosystems Initiative Munich (NIM), and the\nDGCyT of the Spanish government through grant No.\nFIS2005-01299.\n\nReferences\n1.
