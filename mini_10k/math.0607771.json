One of\nthe main concepts introduced is the notion of physical (or Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen) measure\nfor a flow or a transformation. An invariant probability measure \u03bc for a flow Xt on\na compact manifold is a physical probability measure if the points z satisfying for all\ncontinuous functions \u03c8\n1\nlim\nt\u2192+\u221e t\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nt\n\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\ns\n\u03c8 X (z) ds =\n\u03c8 d\u03bc,\n\nform a subset with positive volume (or positive Lebesgue measure) on the ambient\nspace. These time averages are in principle physically observable if the flow models a\nreal world phenomenon admitting some measurable features.\nFor systems admitting such invariant probability measures it is natural to consider\nthe rate of convergence of the time averages to the space average, given by the volume of the subset of points whose time averages stay away from the space average\nby a prescribed amount up to some evolution time. This rate is closely related to the\nso-called thermodynamical formalism first developed for (uniformly) hyperbolic diffeomorphisms, borrowed from statistical mechanics by Bowen, Ruelle and Sinai (among\nothers, see e.g. [22, 23, 51, 52, 29, 21]). These authors systematically studied the construction and properties of physical measures for (uniformly) hyperbolic diffeomorphisms\nand flows. Such measures for non-uniformly hyperbolic maps and flows where obtained\nmore recently [48, 25, 18, 19, 2].\nThe probabilistic properties of physical measures are an object of intense study, see\ne.g. [23, 37, 58, 59, 20, 3, 4, 6, 32, 11, 7]. The main insight behind these efforts is that the\nfamily {\u03c8 \u25e6 Xt }t>0 should behave asymptotically in many respects just like a i.i.d. random\nvariable.\nThe study of suspension (or special) flows is motivated by modeling a flow admitting a cross-section. Such flow is equivalent to a suspension semiflow over the Poincar\u00e9\nreturn map to the cross-section with roof function given by the return time function\nfor the points in the cross-section. This is one of the main technical tools in the ergodic\ntheory of Axiom A (or uniformly hyperbolic) flows developed by Bowen and Ruelle [23],\nenabling them to pass from this type of flow to a suspension flow over a shift transformation with finitely many symbols and bounded roof function. Then the properties of\n2\n\n\fthe base transformation are used to deduce many results for the suspension flow, which\nare then passed to the original flow.\nRecently, based on the breakthrough of Dolgopyat [27], this kind of modeling provided results on the rate of decay of correlations for certain flows [13] based on the rate\nof decay of correlations for suspension semiflows [15]. General results on the existence\nand some statistical properties of physical measures for singular-hyperbolic attractors\nfor three-dimensional flows [10] as well as their sensitive dependence on initial conditions were also obtained using this standard technique. Moreover the classical Lorenz\nflow [43] was shown to be equivalent to a geometric Lorenz flow by Tucker [54] and so\nit can be modeled by a suspension semiflow over a non-uniformly hyperbolic transformation with unbounded roof function. Using these ideas it was recently obtained [44]\nthat the physical measure for the Lorenz attractor is mixing.\nHere we extend part of the results on large deviation rates of Kifer [37] (see also\nWaddington [57]) from the uniformly hyperbolic setting to semiflows over non-uniformly\nexpanding base dynamics and unbounded roof function. These special flows model\nnon-hyperbolic flows, like the Lorenz flow, exhibiting equilibria accumulated by regular orbits. We use the properties of non-uniformly expanding transformations, especially\nthe large deviation bound obtained in [7], to deduce a large deviation bound for the suspension semiflow reducing the estimate of the volume of the deviation set to the volume\nof a certain deviation set for the base transformation. More precisely, if we set \u03b5 > 0 as\nan error margin and consider\nZ\nZ\no\nn\n1 t \u0010 t \u0011\nBt = z :\n\u03c8 X (z) \u2212\n\u03c8 d\u03bc > \u03b5\nt 0\nthen we are able to provide conditions under which the Lebesgue measure of Bt decays\nto zero exponentially fast, i.e. weather there are constants C, \u03be > 0 such that\n\u0010 \u0011\nLeb Bt \u2264 Ce\u2212\u03bet for all t > 0.\n\nThe values of C, \u03be > 0 above depend on \u03b5, \u03c8 and on global invariants for the base\ntransformation f , such as the metric entropy and the pressure function of f with respect\nto the physical measures of f and a certain observable constructed from \u03c8 and Xt , as\ndetailed in the next section. Having this it is not difficult to deduce exponential escape\nrates from subsets of the semiflow.\nIn order to be able to apply this bound to Lorenz flows, it is necessary to allow the\nroof function of the suspension flows to be unbounded near the singularities of the\nbase dynamical system. This in turn imposes some restrictions on the admissible base\ndynamics, expressed as a slow recurrence rate to the singular set and uniqueness of\nequilibrium states with respect to the logarithm of the Jacobian of the map. However no\ncohomology condition on the roof function are needed, while this is essential to obtain\nfast decay of correlations in [28, 45, 30].\nWe present several semiflows with non-uniformly expanding base transformations\nsatisfying all our conditions, including one-dimensional piecewise expanding maps with\n3\n\n\fLorenz-like singularities and quadratic maps but also multidimensional examples. This\ndemanded the detailed study of recurrence rates to the singular set, the study of large\ndeviation bounds for unbounded observables over non-uniformly expanding transformations, and an entropy formula for non-uniformly expanding maps with singularities\n(which might be of independent interest). Now we give the precise statement of the\nresults.\n\n1.1 Statement of the results\nDenote by k * k a Riemannian norm on the compact boundaryless manifold M, by dist\nthe induced distance and by Leb the corresponding Riemannian volume form, which\nwe call Lebesgue measure or volume. We assume Leb to be normalized: Leb(M) = 1.\nGiven a C2 local diffeomorphism (H\u00f6lder-C1 is enough, see below) f : M \\ S \u2192 M\noutside a volume zero non-flat singular set, let Xt : Mr \u2192 Mr be a semiflow with roof\nfunction r : M \\ S \u2192 R over the base transformation f , as follows. Set Mr = {(x, y) \u2208\nM \u00d7 [0, +\u221e) : 0 \u2264 y < r(x)}. For x = x0 \u2208 M denote by xn the nth iterate f n (x0 ) for n \u2265 0.\nP\nf\nDenote Sn \u03c6(x0 ) = Sn \u03c6(x0 ) = n\u22121\nj=0 \u03c6(x j ) for n \u2265 1 and for any given real function \u03c6 in\nwhat follows. Then for each pair (x0 , s0 ) \u2208 Xr and t > 0 there exists a unique n \u2265 1 such\nthat Sn r(x0 ) \u2264 s0 + t < Sn+1 r(x0 ) and we define\n\u0010\n\u0011\nXt (x0 , s0 ) = xn , s0 + t \u2212 Sn r(x0 ) .\nThe non-flatness of the singular set S is an extension to arbitrary dimensions of the\nnotion of non-flat singular set from one-dimensional dynamics [26] and means that f\nbehaves like a power of the distance to the singular set. More precisely there are constants\nB > 1 and 0 < \u03b2 < 1 for which\n(S1)\n\nkD f (x)vk\n1\ndist(x, S)\u03b2 \u2264\n\u2264 B dist(x, S)\u2212\u03b2 ;\nB\nkvk\n\n(S2) log kD f (x)\u22121 k \u2212 log kD f (y)\u22121 k \u2264 B\n\ndist(x, y)\n;\ndist(x, S)\u03b2\n\n(S3) log | det D f (x)\u22121 | \u2212 log | det D f (y)\u22121 | \u2264 B\n\ndist(x, y)\n;\ndist(x, S)\u03b2\n\nfor every x, y \u2208 M \\ S with dist(x, y) < dist(x, S)/2 and v \u2208 Tx M \\ {0}. We also assume an\nextra condition related to the geometry of S. This ensures that the Lebesgue measure\nof neighborhoods S is comparable to a power of the distance to S, that is there exists\nC\u03ba , \u03ba > 0 such that for all small \u03c1 > 0\n(S4) Leb{x \u2208 M : dist(x, S) < \u03c1} \u2264 C\u03ba * \u03c1\u03ba .\nThe singular set S contains those points x where f is either not defined, is discontinuous,\nnot differentiable or else D f (x) is non-invertible (that is S contains the set C of critical\n4\n\n\fpoints of f ). Note that condition (S4) is satisfied in the particular case when S is a\ncompact submanifold of M, where \u03ba = dim(M) \u2212 dim(S). It is also satisfied for M = S1\nand S is a denumerable infinite subset with finitely many accumulation points, with\n\u03ba = 1. In particular this holds for a piecewise expanding map over the interval or the\ncircle with finitely many domains of monotonicity.\nWe say that f is non-uniformly expanding if there exists c > 0 such that\n1\nlim sup Sn \u03c8(x) \u2264 \u2212c where\nn\u2192+\u221e n\n\n\u03c8(x) = log D f (x)\u22121 ,\n\n(1.1)\n\nfor Lebesgue almost every x \u2208 M. This condition implies in particular that all the lower\nLyapunov exponents of the map f are strictly positive Lebesgue almost everywhere.\nLet \u2206\u03b4 (x) = log d\u03b4 (x, S) be the smooth \u03b4-truncated logarithmic distance from x \u2208 M to S,\ni.e. \u2206\u03b4 (x) is non-negative and continuous away from S, identically zero 2\u03b4-away from S,\nand equal to \u2212 log dist(x, S) when dist(x, S) \u2264 \u03b4.\nWe say that f has exponentially slow recurrence to the singular set S if for every \u03b5 > 0\nthere exists \u03b4 > 0 such that\n\u001a\n\u001b\n1\n1\n(1.2)\nlim sup log Leb x \u2208 M : Sn \u2206\u03b4 (x) > \u03b5 < 0.\nn\nn\u2192+\u221e n\nCondition (1.2) implies that Sn \u2206\u03b4 /n \u2192 0 in measure, i.e. for every \u03b5 > 0 there exists \u03b4 > 0\nsuch that\n1\nlim sup Sn \u2206\u03b4 (x) \u2264 \u03b5\nn\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n(1.3)\n\nfor Lebesgue almost every x \u2208 M. We say that a map f satisfying (1.3) has slow recurrence\nto S.\nThese notions were presented in [5] and in [5, 1] the following result on existence of\nfinitely many absolutely continuous measures was obtained.\nTheorem 1.1. Let f : M \u2192 M be a C2 local diffeomorphism outside a singular set S. Assume\nthat f is non-uniformly expanding with slow recurrence to S. Then there are finitely many\nergodic absolutely continuous (in particular physical or Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen) f -invariant\nprobability measures \u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bck whose basins cover the manifold Lebesgue almost everywhere,\nthat is B(\u03bc1 ) \u222a * * * \u222a B(\u03bck ) = M, Leb \u2212 mod 0. Moreover the support of each measure contains\nan open disk in M.\nHere the basin of an invariant probability measure \u03bc is the subset of points x \u2208 M\nP\n\u2217\nsuch that limn\u2192\u221e n1 n\u22121\nj=0 \u03b4 f j (x) = \u03bc in the weak topology.\nLarge deviation bounds are usually related to measure theoretic entropy and to\nequilibrium states. We denote by M f the family of all invariant probability measures\nwith respect to f . Let J = | det D f |. We say that \u03bc \u2208 M f is an equilibrium state with respect\nto the potential log J if h\u03bc ( f ) = \u03bc(log J), that is if \u03bc satisfies the Entropy Formula. We denote\n5\n\n\fby E the subset of M f consisting of all equilibrium states for f . It is not difficult to see\n(Section 5 for more details) that each physical measure provided by Theorem 1.1 belongs\nto E.\nAnother standing assumption on f is that the set E is formed by a unique f -invariant\nabsolutely continuous probability measure (see Section 2 for sufficient conditions for this to\noccur and for examples of application).\nWe denote by \u03bd = \u03bc \u22c9 Leb1 the natural Xt -invariant extension of \u03bc to Mr and by \u03bb\nthe natural extension of Leb to Mr , i.e. \u03bb = Leb \u22c9 Leb1 , where Leb1 is one-dimensional\nLebesgue measure on R: for any subset A \u2282 Mr\nZ\nZ r(x)\nZ\nZ r(x)\n1\n1\nd\u03bc(x)\nd Leb(x)\nds \u03c7A (x, s) and \u03bb(A) =\nds \u03c7A (x, s).\n\u03bd(A) =\n\u03bc(r)\nLeb(r)\n0\n0\nWe say that a function \u03c6 : M \\ S \u2192 R has logarithmic growth near S if there exists\nK = K(\u03c6) > 0 such that\n|\u03c6|\u03c7B(S,\u03b4) \u2264 K * \u2206\u03b4 for all small enough \u03b4 > 0.\n\n(1.4)\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nWe also say that f is a regular map if for E \u2282 M such that Leb(E) = 0, then Leb f \u22121 (E) = 0.\n\nTheorem A.

It turned out that these equations became one of the main models showing\nthe presence of chaotic dynamics in apparently simple systems. More recently Tucker\n[54, 55] with a computer assisted proof showed that equations (1.7) and similar equations\nwith nearby parameters define a geometric Lorenz flow, i.e. a three-dimensional flow Xt\nin R3 with a hyperbolic singularity at the origin admitting a neighborhood U (a trapping\nregion) such that Xt (U) \u2282 U for all t > 0 satisfying:\n1. the attracting set \u039b = \u2229t>0 Xt (U) contains the singularity at 0;\n2. \u039b contains a dense orbit;\n3. there exists a square S = [\u22121, 1] \u00d7 [\u22121, 1] \u00d7 {1} which is a cross-section for \u039b \\ {0},\nthat is for every w \u2208 \u039b \\ {0} there exists t > 0 such that Xt (w) \u2208 S;\n4. the Poincar\u00e9 first return map to S given by R : S\\l \u2192 S is C2 and contracts distances\nexponentially on the y direction, where l = {0} \u00d7 [\u22121, 1] \u00d7 {1} is the singular line,\nso each segment S \u2229 {x = const} is contained in a stable manifold. Moreover in\ngeneral this one-dimensional and co-dimension one foliation of the cross-section\nS defines a projection P along leaves which is C1+\u03b1 for some \u03b1 > 0;\n5. the one-dimensional map f : [\u22121, 1] \\ {0} \u2192 [\u22121, 1] obtained from R quotienting\nout the stable manifolds is a piecewise expanding map with singularities known\nas Lorenz-like map, which is in the setting of the class of examples detailed in\nSubsection 2.2;\n6. the roof function \u03c4(w) for w \u2208 S is Lebesgue integrable over S and has logarithmic\ngrowth near the singular line l.\nIt is well known that the attractor of the geometric Lorenz flows (and the attractor for\nthe Lorenz equations after the results of Tucker already mentioned) supports a unique\nergodic physical measure \u03bc (for more details on this construction see e.g. [56]). Figure 1\ngives a visual idea of the geometric Lorenz flow. The reader should consult [33, 34, 50]\nfor proofs of the properties stated above and more details on the construction of such\nflows. Using \u03c4 as a roof function over the base dynamics given by R we see that the\ndynamics of a geometric Lorenz flow on U is equivalent to a suspension semiflow over R\nwith roof function \u03c4. In addition the uniform contraction along the leaves of the foliation\n{y = const} together with the uniform expansion of the one-dimensional map f enables\nus to use Theorem A to deduce\n7\n\n\fS\n\n1\n\nf (x)\nPSfrag replacements\nl\n\u03bb3\n\u03bb2\n\n\u03bb1\n\u22121\n\n0\n\n1\n\nFigure 1: The geometric Lorenz flow and the associated one-dimensional piecewise\nexpanding map\nCorollary C.

Therefore the C2 condition on f in the statements of results can be relaxed to\nC1+\u03b1 throughout.\nKifer [37] together with Newhouse [38] obtain sharp large deviations bounds both\nfrom above and from below for uniformly partially hyperbolic attractors for flows and for\nAxiom A flows, through an estimate of the volume growth of images of balls under the\naction of the flow near the attractor (\"volume lemma\", see also [23] and [22]). Moreover\nto obtain the lower bound an assumption of uniqueness of equilibrium states is necessary\nand this assumption is also used to prove that the upper bound is strictly negative (see\nalso [58] for uniformly expanding transformations and for partially hyperbolic attractors\nfor diffeomorphisms).\nHence the assumption that E is formed by a single measure is natural in this setting.\nThe author feels this assumption should not be needed to obtain an expression for the\nupper bound in terms of entropies, as in [37]. However the relevant \"volume lemmas\"\nare presently not available in the setting of special flows over non-uniformly expanding\nbase, with singularities or criticalities. Moreover the uniqueness of equilibrium states\n8\n\n\fwith respect to a large family of potentials (or observables) is still unknown in general\n(see [47, 12, 11] for recent progress in this direction). Therefore instead of following\nthe approach of [37] we have reduced the problem of estimating the deviations for the\nsuspension flow, with respect to a continuous observable, to the problem of estimating\ndeviations for the base transformation, with respect to an unbounded observable, and\nthen rely on previous work [7] for non-uniformly expanding transformations. To deal\nwith the dynamics near the singularities we impose conditions of very slow recurrence\nto the singular set S for the base transformation f together with a growth condition on\nthe roof function r near the singularities. In the end to conclude that the upper bound\nis strictly negative we use uniqueness of the relevant equilibrium state. Unfortunately\nthis argument does not rule out superexponential decay in (1.5).\nRecently Melbourne and Nicol [46] obtained sharp large deviation bounds (i.e. they\nshowed that the limit (1.5) exists) for systems modeled on Markov towers (also known\nas Young towers) without requiring uniqueness of equilibrium states. In the same work\nupper large deviation bounds are obtained for semiflows over Markov towers assuming\nthat the roof function is bounded. However their method presents two disadvantages:\nthe large deviation estimates in [46] are proved only for H\u00f6lder observables, and these\nestimates are obtained for the invariant physical measure rather than the volume or\nLebesgue measure, which is more directly accessible.\nSection 2 shows how the conditions of f and on r are satisfied by many relevant\nexamples. In particular in Subsection 2.4 it is explained how to obtain a large deviation\nbound for geometric Lorenz flows using the statement of the Main Theorem applied\nto suspensions semiflows over piecewise expanding maps with singularities, which are\ntreated in a preliminary fashion in Subsection 2.2 and at length in Section 6. The main\nresult needed for the proof of the Main Theorem is a large deviation bound for observables with logarithmic growth near the singular set for a non-uniformly expanding\nmap, which is proved in Section 3. Then the statement of the Main Theorem about large\ndeviations for a suspension semiflow is reduced to a statement of large deviations for\nthe dynamics of the base transformation in Section 4 concluding the proof of the Main\nTheorem. Note that in contrast to the results on decay of correlations for Anosov flows\nor Axiom A flows, here we do not need any coboundary conditions on the roof function\nfor the large deviation bound to hold.\nIn Section 5 we present a derivation of the Entropy Formula for non-uniformly\nexpanding maps with slow recurrence to the singular set, which is used to establish that\nsome examples presented in Section 2 do satisfy our assumptions and which might be\ninteresting in itself.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis paper answers a question posed to me by M. Viana. I am thankful to S. Senti for\nhaving pointed to me how to make the example in Subsection 2.3 work.

I wish to thank the referee for his/her valuable suggestions\nwhich helped improve the presentation.\n\n2 Examples of application\nHere we present some concrete examples where our results can be applied.\n\n2.1 Suspension semiflows over multidimensional volume expanding\nand quasi-expanding maps\nLet f : M\\S \u2192 M be a transitive non-uniformly expanding map with exponentially slow\nrecurrence to S satisfying J = | det D f | > 1, \u03c8 = log k(D f )\u22121 k \u2264 0 and \u03c8 = 0 at finitely\nmany points only (a quasi-expanding map). We claim that in this setting E is a singleton.\nIndeed E is non-empty by Theorem 1.1 since every absolutely continuous invariant\nprobability measure is an equilibrium state (see e.g. Theorem 5.1 in Section 5). Since\nf | M \\ S is a local diffeomorphism and the support of such absolutely continuous\ninvariant measures contains open sets, the transitivity together with regularity of the\nmap ensure that there exists only one absolutely continuous invariant measure. For\notherwise let \u03bci be ergodic absolutely continuous f -invariant probability measures and\nlet Bi \u2282 supp(\u03bci ) be open sets in the support i = 1, 2; by transitivity and continuity\nthere exists a non-empty open subset B \u2282 B1 and an iterate such that f n (B) \u2282 B2 and\nby smoothness Leb-almost every point in f n (B) is both a \u03bc1 -generic point and a \u03bc2 generic point, thus \u03bc1 \u2261 \u03bc2 . This shows that there exists a unique absolutely continuous\ninvariant probability measure for f .\nNote now that every equilibrium state \u03bd \u2208 E must be such that h\u03bd ( f ) = \u03bd(log J) > 0 and\nsince \u03c8 \u2264 0 and has at most finitely many zeroes, then either \u03bd(\u03c8) < 0 and by Theorem\n5.1 the measure \u03bd must be absolutely continuous, or \u03bd(\u03c8) = 0 and supp \u03bd \u2286 \u03c8\u22121 ({0}) is\nfinite thus h\u03bd ( f ) = 0, a contradiction.\nTherefore by the uniqueness result above \u03bd must coincide with \u03bc. We have shown\nthat E = {\u03bc}, as claimed.\nHence we can apply Theorem A for semiflows over non-uniformly expanding maps\nwith exponentially slow recurrence to the singular set which are also transitive, volume\nexpanding and expanding except at finitely many points, and whose roof function grows\nwith the logarithm of the distance to S.\nFor examples of multidimensional local diffeomorphisms in this setting see [9]. In\nthis case S = \u2205 and we can apply Theorem A for semiflows with this type of base\ntransformation plus a continuous (and thus bounded) roof function.\nClearly the same large deviation bound holds for a semiflow over a local diffeomorphisms which is uniformly expanding together with any continuous roof function.\n\n10\n\n\f2.2 Suspension semiflows over piecewise expanding maps with singularities\nLet M be the circle S1 or the interval [0, 1] with {0, 1} \u2282 S and S \u2282 M an at most\ndenumerable and non-flat singular set of f such that its closure S has zero Lebesgue\nmeasure: Leb(S) = 0.\nIf we assume that \u2212\u221e < \u03c8 < \u2212c < 0 on M \\ S for some c > 0 (so that in particular\nthere are no critical points: C = \u2205) and that f is transitive with slow recurrence to\nS, then the set E of equilibrium states with respect to log | f \u2032 | is formed by a single\nabsolutely continuous invariant probability measure, as shown in Subsection 2.1, since\nf is automatically non-uniformly expanding, quasi-expanding and volume expanding\nas well.\nObserve that for C2 maps in our conditions with finitely many smoothness domains,\nor with derivative of bounded variation, it is well known that there exists a unique\nergodic absolutely continuous invariant probability measure \u03bc with bounded density\n[35, 53]. Since the function log dist(x, S) is Leb-integrable we\nR also have that this function\nlog dist\u03b4 (x, S) d\u03bc(x) < \u03b5. By\nis \u03bc-integrable. Thus for all \u03b5 > 0 there is \u03b4 > 0 such that\nthe ergodicity and absolute continuity of \u03bc this means that f has slow recurrence to S for\na positive Lebesgue measure subset of M. Theorem 1.1 together with [5] ensure that f is\nin fact non-uniformly expanding with slow recurrence to S. Moreover by [36] the same\nargument applies to C1+\u03b1 piecewise expanding maps with finitely many smoothness\ndomains, for some \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1).\nTo be able to apply the Main Theorem we need exponentially slow recurrence to S.\nWe prove this in Section 6 assuming that | f \u2032 | grows as the inverse of some power of the\ndistance to S\u2032 = S \u2229 f (M), i.e. besides conditions (S1) through (S4) we impose\n(S5) f \u2032 (x) \u2265 B\u22121 dist(x, S\u2032 )\u2212\u03b2 for all x \u2208 M \\ S,\nwhere S\u2032 is the (sub)set of singularities which matters for the asymptotic dynamics of f .\nHence a semiflow over a piecewise expanding map with singularities satisfying some technical\nconditions, and with a roof function having logarithmic growth near the singularities admits a\nlarge deviation bound as in Theorem A.\n\n2.3 Suspension semiflows over quadratic maps on Benedicks-Carleson\nparameters\nSet M = I = [\u22121, 1] and suppose the transformation f is given by fa (x) = a\u2212x2 for a \u2208 [a0 , 2]\nin the positive Lebesgue measure subset constructed by Benedicks and Carleson in\n[16, 17], where a0 \u2248 2. The properties of the family fa have been thoroughly studied\nby a considerable number of people. We just mention that Freitas in [31] showed that\nfor these parameters fa is not only a non-uniformly expanding map with S = C = {0}\nbut also exhibits exponentially slow approximation to the singular set. Actually in [31]\nonly subexponentially slow approximation is stated but the same arguments yield an\n11\n\n\fexponential bound as well, as obtained in a much more delicate setting with infinitely\nmany critical points in [8].\nMoreover Bruin and Keller [24] show that for this class of maps (specifically for\n1/n\n\nCollet-Eckman maps, i.e. such that lim infn\u2192\u221e ( fan )\u2032 (a)\n> 1 without extra conditions\nof recurrence to the criticality) the unique absolutely continuous invariant probability\nmeasure is also the unique equilibrium state with respect to log | fa\u2032 |.\nTherefore for any given suspension semiflow over such quadratic maps fa with roof\nfunction having logarithmic growth near 0 we can apply Theorem A, and obtain a large\ndeviation bound for these special flows.\n\n2.4 Lorenz and geometric Lorenz attractors\nThe C1+\u03b1 map f : [\u22121, 1] \\ {0} \u2192 [\u22121, 1] obtained as the quotient map of the Poincar\u00e9 first\nreturn map R presented in Section 1.3 through projection along the leaves of the stable\nfoliation satisfies the following conditions, which define a Lorenz-like map:\n1. there are constants c > 0 and \u03c3 > 1 such that for every n \u2265 1 and for all x \u2208\n[\u22121, 1] \\ \u222a0\u2264j<n f \u2212n {0} we have ( f n )\u2032 (x) \u2265 c\u03c3n ;\n2. f has a dense orbit;\n3. f (0+ ) = \u22121, f (0\u2212 ) = 1, f (1) \u2208 (0, 1) and f (\u22121) \u2208 (\u22121, 0).\nk\nNote in particular that there are no critical points\n\u221a and that for some k \u2265 1 the map g = f\nsatisfies the conditions of Section 2.2. (If \u03c3 > 2 then f is even locally eventually onto,\nsee e.g. [44], thus transitive.) For exponentially slow recurrence to the singularities see\nSection 6. So we can obtain a large deviation bound for g which easily gives a large\ndeviation bound for f .\nIndeed, assume without loss of generality that \u03bc(\u03c6) = 0 and that for all small \u03b5 > 0\ng\nwe have Leb{Sn \u03c6 > n\u03b5} < Ce\u2212\u03b6n for some C(\u03b5), \u03b6(\u03b5) > 0 and every n > 0. It is enough to\nargue for a bounded and continuous \u03c6 as explained in Section 3.

For this we strongly use the\nuniform contraction along the leaves of the stable foliation on the global cross-section S\nto obtain the following relation. Denote by P : S \u2192 [\u22121, 1] the projection (x, y, 1) 7\u2192 x.\nLemma 2.1.

According to the construction of geometric Lorenz flows, there are C > 0 and\n0 < \u03bb < 1 such that given x \u2208 [\u22121, 1] \\ {0} and two distinct values y1 , y2 \u2208 [\u22121, 1]\n\u0010\n\u0011\ndist Rk (x, y1 , 1), Rk (x, y2 , 1) \u2264 C\u03bbk for all 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n,\n(2.2)\n\nwhere n \u2265 1 is the first time the orbit of the points hit the singular line, corresponding\nto the stable foliation of the singularity of the flow.

The singular set S is formed by critical points of f\nand points where f is either not defined, is not continuous or is not differentiable. Recall\nfrom the Introduction that \u03c8 = log k(D f )\u22121 k and that J = | det D f |.\n20\n\n\fTheorem 5.1. Let f : M \u2192 M be a non-uniformly expanding map with slow recurrence to the\nnon-flat singular set S. Let \u03bc \u2208 M f be such that \u03bc is f -ergodic, h\u03bc ( f ) = \u03bc(log J), \u2212\u221e < \u03bc(\u03c8) < 0\nand for every given \u03b5 > 0 there exists \u03b4 > 0 so that \u03bc(\u2206\u03b4 ) < \u03b5. Then \u03bc \u226a Leb and consequently\n\u03bc \u2208 co(F).\nReciprocally, let \u03bc \u2208 M f be such that \u03bc is absolutely continuous with respect to Leb and\nassume that \u2206\u03b4 is \u03bc-integrable. Then h\u03bc ( f ) = \u03bc(log J).\nHere co(F) is the weak\u2217 closure of the convex hull of the finite set F of ergodic physical\nprobability measures for f . Clearly this is a particular case of the more general Entropy\nFormula obtained by Ledrappier and Young [40, 41] applied to maps with singularities\nand/or criticalities. For C2 endomorphisms (i.e. smooth maps with criticalities but no\nsingularities) see Bahnm\u00fcller and Liu [42, 14] for a general statement. A similar result\nfor piecewise smooth one-dimensional maps with finitely many branches was obtained\nby Ledrappier [39].\nAs an easy corollary we deduce that co(F) is isolated among the set E of all equilibrium states of f with respect to J = log det D f , which might be of independent interest\nfor the ergodic theory of non-uniformly expanding transformations.\nCorollary 5.2. Let f : M \u2192 M be a non-uniformly expanding map with slow recurrence to\nthe non-flat singular set S. Then there exists a weak\u2217 neighborhood U of co(F) in M f such that\nU \u2229 E = co(F).\nProof. Take any weak\u2217 neighborhood U of co(F) such that every \u03bc \u2208 U satisfies \u03bc(\u03c8) < 0.\nHence every \u03bc \u2208 U \u2229 E satisfies the conditions of Theorem 5.1, thus \u03bc \u2208 co(F).\n\u0003\nNote that whenever the Entropy Formula and its reciprocal hold for measures close\nto F then the argument proving Corollary 5.2 is applicable and we deduce that F is\nisolated in E. The proof of Theorem 5.1 is longer and occupies the rest of this section.\n\n5.1 Hyperbolic times\nHere we present some technical results for the study of non-uniformly expanding maps\nwhose proof can be found in [49, 5, 1].\nWe say that n is a (\u03c3, \u03b4, b)-hyperbolic time of f for a point x if there are 0 < \u03c3 < 1\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\u22121\nQ\nj\n\u2264 \u03c3k and d\u03b4 f k (x), S \u2265 e\u2212bk hold for all\nand b, \u03b4 > 0 such that n\u22121\nj=n\u2212k D f f (x)\nk = 0, . . . , n \u2212 1.\nWe now outline the properties of these special times. For detailed proofs see [5,\nProposition 2.8] and [3, Proposition 2.6, Corollary 2.7, Proposition 5.2].\nProposition 5.3. There are constants C1 , \u03b41 > 0 depending on (\u03c3, \u03b4, b) and f only such that,\nif n is (\u03c3, \u03b4, b)-hyperbolic time of f for x, then there are hyperbolic pre-balls Vk (x) which are\nneighborhoods of f n\u2212k (x), k = 1, . . . , n, satisfying\n1. f k | Vk (x) maps Vk (x) diffeomorphically to the ball of radius \u03b41 around f n (x);\n21\n\n\f\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n2. d f n\u2212k (y), f n\u2212k (z) \u2264 \u03c3k/2 * d f n (y), f n (z) for every 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n and y, z \u2208 Vk (x);\n3. C\u22121\n\u2264 det D f n\u2212k (y) / det D f n\u2212k (z) \u2264 C1 for y, z \u2208 Vk (x).\n1\n\nThe following ensures existence of infinitely many hyperbolic times for \u03bc-almost\nevery point for non-uniformly expanding maps with respect to an ergodic invariant\nprobability measure \u03bc. A complete proof can be found in [5, Section 5].\nTheorem 5.4. Let f : M \u2192 M be a C1+\u03b1 local diffeomorphism away from a non-flat singular set\nS, for some \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1), non-uniformly expanding and with slow recurrence to S, with respect to\nan ergodic invariant probability measure \u03bc. That is there exists c > 0 such that\n1\nlim sup Sn \u03c8 \u2264 \u2212c \u03bc \u2212 almost everywhere\nn\u2192+\u221e n\nand for every \u03b5 > 0 there exists \u03b4 > 0 such that\n1\nlim sup Sn \u2206\u03b4 (x) \u2264 \u03b5\nn\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n\u03bc \u2212 almost everywhere.\n\nThen there are \u03c3 \u2208 (0, 1), \u03b4, b > 0 and there exists \u03b8 = \u03b8(\u03c3, \u03b4, b) > 0 such that \u03bc-a.e. x \u2208 M\nhas infinitely many (\u03c3, \u03b4, b)-hyperbolic times. Moreover if we write 0 < n1 < n2 < n2 < . . . for\nk \u2264N}\n\u2265 \u03b8 for\nthe hyperbolic times of x then their asymptotic frequency satisfies lim infN\u2192\u221e #{k\u22651:n\nN\nLeb -a.e. x \u2208 M.\n\n5.2 Existence of generating partition\nLet \u03bc be an f -invariant ergodic probability measure in the conditions of the first part of\nthe statement of Theorem 5.1.\nObserve first that since \u03bc(\u03c8) < 0 and \u03bc is ergodic, then f is non-uniformly expanding.\nMoreover by the assumptions on \u03bc(\u2206\u03b4) we see that f has also slow recurrence to S with\nrespect to \u03bc. Hence by Theorem 5.4 there are \u03c3, \u03b4, b > 0 such that \u03bc-almost all x \u2208 M\nadmits infinitely many (\u03c3, \u03b4, b)-hyperbolic times with positive frequency at infinity. Thus\nthere exists a finite partition P0 of M which is generating with respect to \u03bc.\nIndeed let E = {B(xi , \u03b41/8), i = 1, . . . , l} be a finite open cover of M by \u03b41 /8-balls whose\nboundary has zero \u03bc measure. From this we define a finite partition P0 of M as follows.\nStart by setting P1 = B(x1 , \u03b41/8) as the first element of the partition. Then, assuming that\nP1 , . . . , Pk are already defined, set Pk+1 = B(xk+1 , \u03b41/8) \\ (P1 \u222a * * * \u222a Pk ) for k = 1, . . . , l \u2212 1.\nNote that if Pk , \u2205 then Pk has non-empty interior, diameter smaller than \u03b41 /4 and the\nboundary \u2202Pk is a (finite) union of pieces of boundaries of balls in a Riemannian manifold.\nThus \u2202Pk has zero Lebesgue measure and zero \u03bc-measure also. Define P0 by the elements\nPk constructed above which are non-empty. Note that \u03bc(\u2202P0 ) = Leb(\u2202P0 ) = 0 and by\nthe existence of infinitely\u0010 many (\u03c3, \u03b4, b)-hyperbolic\ntimes for \u03bc-almost every x it is not\n\u0011\nWn\u22121 \u2212j\ndifficult to see that diam\nj=0 f P0 (x) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 0.\nn\u2192+\u221e\n\n22\n\n\fTherefore, since \u03bc satisfies the Entropy Formula, we can write\nZ\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n1\n1\nSn log J d\u03bc = \u03bc(log J) = h\u03bc ( f ) = h\u03bc ( f, P0) \u2264 H\u03bc (Pn ) =\n\u2212 log \u03bc Pn (x) d\u03bc\nn\nn\nn\nWn\u22121 \u2212j\nwhere Pn =\nj=0 f P0 for n \u2265 1.

The hyperbolic times satisfying this condition will be\ncalled \u03bc-hyperbolic times. To use this we need some way to cover any set using atoms of\nthe sequence (Pn )n at \u03bc-hyperbolic times.\n\n5.3 Coverings by hyperbolic times\nLet \u03bc, f and (Pn )n\u22650 be as in the previous subsection. Note that since f is regular and \u03bc\nis f -invariant the boundary of g(P) still has zero Lebesgue measure and zero \u03bc-measure\nfor every atom P \u2208 P0 and every inverse branch g of f n , for any n \u2265 1.\nWe can now state the following flexible covering lemma with \u03bc-hyperbolic preballs.\nIt will enable us to approximate the \u03bc-measure of a given set through the measure of\nfamilies of \u03bc-hyperbolic preballs.\nLemma 5.5 (The Hyperbolic Covering Lemma). Let a measurable set E \u2282 M, m \u2265 1 and\n\u03b6 > 0 be given with \u03bc(E) > 0. Let \u03b8 > 0 be a lower bound for the density of \u03bc-hyperbolic times\nfor \u03bc-almost every point. Then there are integers m < n1 < * * * < nk for k = k(\u03b6) \u2265 1 and families\nEi of subsets of M, i = 1, . . . , k such that\n23\n\n\f1.

Indeed observe that, by (5.1) and\u0010 the choice\nof (\u03b3n )n\u22651 , for any\n\u0011\nn\ngiven \u03b7 > 0 we can find N = N(\u03b7) \u2208 N such that \u0393\u03b7 = \u2229n\u2265N M\\Q\u03b3n satisfies \u03bc(\u0393\u03b7 ) \u2265 1 \u2212 \u03b7.\nLet E \u2282 M be given with \u03bc(E \u2229 \u0393\u03b7 ) > 0. Let\n\u0010 m = N in the \u0011statement of the Covering\nLemma 5.5 and set \u03b6 > 0 small. Then we get \u03bc (E \u2229 \u0393\u03b7 )\u25b3 \u222aki=1 Ei < \u03b6 where all elements of\nEi are \u03bc-preballs and atoms of Pni satisfying the bound (5.2). In particular by the choice\nof m we have \u222ai Ei \u2282 \u0393\u03b7 and so we may write\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03bc(E) = \u03bc E \u2229 M \\ \u0393\u03b7 + \u03bc E \u2229 \u0393\u03b7 \u2264 \u03b7 + \u03b6 + \u03bc E \u2229 \u222ai Ei \u2264 \u03b7 + \u03b6 + C0 \u03b3nk Leb E \u2229 \u222ai Ei ,\n(5.3)\nwhere nk is the largest \u03bc-hyperbolic time used in the cover given by the Hyperbolic\nCovering Lemma.\nHence if we start with a subset E with Leb(E) = 0 and assume that \u03bc(E) > 0, then\nthere exists \u03b70 such that \u03bc(E \u2229 \u0393\u03b7 ) > 0 for all 0 < \u03b7 \u2264 \u03b70 . Therefore given \u03b6 > 0 as above\nwe obtain (5.3). But since Leb(E) = 0 we get \u03bc(Z) \u2264 \u03b7 + \u03b6, for all 0 < \u03b7 \u2264 \u03b70 , that is\n\u03bc(Z) \u2264 \u03b6. This is a contradiction since we may take \u03b6 > 0 as small as we like.\nWe have shown that if Leb(E) = 0 then \u03bc(E) = 0, i.e. \u03bc \u226a Leb. Then since the basins\nof the physical measures of f cover M except\u0010for a \u0011volume zero subset, then it follows\nP\neasily by the Ergodic Theorem that \u03bc = ki=1 \u03bc B(\u03bci ) * \u03bci , that is \u03bc \u2208 co(F).\nReciprocally, let us now assume that \u03bc is an f -invariant absolutely continuous probability measure. Then as above we have \u03bc \u2208 co(F) and and thus for some constants\nP\nP\nP\n\u03b1i \u2265 0 such that i \u03b1i = 1 we have h\u03bc ( f ) = ki=1 \u03b1i h\u03bci ( f ) = ki=1 \u03b1i \u03bci (log J) = \u03bc(log J). This\nconcludes the proof of Theorem 5.1.\n\n24\n\n\f6 Exponentially slow approximation to singularities\nHere we apply the (by now standard) arguments of Benedicks and Carleson, first presented in [16, 17], to show that Lorenz-like maps have exponentially slow recurrence to\nsingularities. This completes the presentation of the examples in Section 2.2.\nLet f : M \u2192 M be a one-dimensional C1+\u03b1 piecewise expanding map with at most\ncountably many smoothness domains for some \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) as in Subsection 2.2, that\nis | f \u2032 | \u2265 \u03c3 > 1 and the non-degenerate singular set S equals the boundaries of the\nsmoothness domains and satisfies all the conditions (S1) through (S5). Then S = {bn }n\nwhere we may assume that the sequence is strictly monotonous (in counter-clockwise\norder if M = S1 ).\nWe consider the middle points cn = (bn + bn+1 )/2 for all applicable indexes n to define\na Lebesgue modulo zero partition P0 of M as follows.\n\n6.1 Initial partition\nPartition (bn , cn ) into subintervals\n\u0011\n\u0010\nM(2n, p) = bn + d2n e\u2212p , bn + d2n e\u2212(p\u22121) ,\n\n(6.1)\n\nwhere d2n = cn \u2212 bn and partition the interval (cn\u22121 , bn ) into the following subintervals\n\u0010\n\u0011\nM(2n \u2212 1, p) = bn \u2212 d2n\u22121 e\u2212(p\u22121) , bn \u2212 d2n\u22121 e\u2212p\n(6.2)\nwhere d2n\u22121 = bn \u2212 cn\u22121 , for all p \u2265 1. The sets defined above form a partition of M\nLebesgue modulo zero consisting of small intervals whose length is exponentially small\nwith respect to the distance to S. Let S\u2032 = S \u2229 f (M) be the set of singular points of f\nwhich matter for the asymptotic dynamics of f .\nTo define the initial partition consider a threshold \u03c10 \u2208 N such that\n!\u0012\n\u03c10 \u00132/\u03c10\n2\n\u2212\u03b2\u03c10\ne\n< 1 and\n1+\n< e\u03b2\n(6.3)\n1+\n\u03c10\n2\nand let P0 be formed by the collection of all intervals\nM(n, p) for all n and\n\u0010\n\u0011 every p \u2265 \u03c10\ntogether with the connected components of M \\ \u222an;p\u2265\u03c10 M(n, p) \u222a {cn }n , which will be\ndenoted by M(n, \u03c10 \u2212 1) whenever they are adjacent to M(n, \u03c10 ).\nFor each element \u03b7 of P0 denote by \u03b7+ the interval obtained by joining \u03b7 with its two\nneighboring intervals in P0 . From (6.1) and (6.2) we have the following relations for all\nk and every p \u2265 \u03c10 \u2212 1\nLeb(M(k, p)+ ) \u2264 9 Leb(M(k, p)) = 9dk * e\u2212p (e \u2212 1).\n\n25\n\n(6.4)\n\n\f6.2 Refining the partition\nThe partition P0 is dynamically refined so that any pair x, y of points in the same atom\nof the nth refinement Pn belong to the same element of P0 during the first consecutive n\niterates, i.e. P0 ( f i (x)) = P0 ( f i (y)) for i = 0, . . . , n \u2212 1. Moreover f n | \u03c9 is a diffeomorphism\nfor every interval \u03c9 \u2208 Pn .\nThe refinement is defined inductively. Assume that Pn is already defined and for\neach \u03c9 \u2208 Pn there are sets Rn (\u03c9) of splitting times and Dn (\u03c9) of corresponding splitting\ndepths, to be defined below.\nIf f n+1 (\u03c9) intersects three or fewer elements of P0 , then we set \u03c9 \u2208 Pn+1 , Rn+1 (\u03c9) =\n\u0010\n\u0011\u22121\nRn (\u03c9) and Dn+1 (\u03c9) = Dn (\u03c9). Otherwise consider the subsets \u03b7\u2032 = f n+1 | \u03c9 (\u03b7) of the\ninterval \u03c9, for all elements \u03b7 of P0 which intersect f n+1 (\u03c9).\nThe family {\u03b7\u2032 } obtained above is a partition of \u03c9. Observe that f n+1 (\u03b7\u2032 ) is either equal\nto some \u03b7 \u2208 P0 or strictly contained in some \u03b7 \u2208 P0 . In the latter case we redefine the\npartition joining some of the extreme intervals of {\u03b7\u2032 } with its neighbors so that the new\npartition {\u03b6} of \u03c9 satisfies: for each \u03b6 there exists \u03b7 = M(k, p) \u2208 P0 such that \u03b7 \u2286 f n (\u03b6) \u2286 \u03b7+ .\nFinally we set \u03b6 \u2208 Pn+1 , Rn+1 (\u03b6) = Rn (\u03b6) \u222a {n + 1} and Dn+1 (\u03b6) = Dn (\u03b6) \u222a {(k, p)}, for\neach element of the partition {\u03b6} of \u03c9 constructed above. For these elements of Pn+1 we\nsay that n + 1 is a splitting time and the pairs (k, p) are the corresponding splitting depths.\nRepeat the procedure for each \u03c9 \u2208 Pn . This completes the construction of Pn+1 from Pn\nfor all n \u2265 0.\n\n6.3 Bounded distortion\nThe uniform expansion of length during n iterates ensures that we have bounded distortion of lengths on atoms of the partition Pn .\nIndeed let \u03c9 \u2208 Pn for some n \u2265 1 and let x, y \u2208 \u03c9. Note that f i | \u03c9 is a diffeomorphism\nfor i = 1, . . . , n, f expands distances at a minimum rate of \u03c3 and f \u2032 is \u03b1-H\u00f6lder.

Finally since l(\u03b4) grows without limit when \u03b4 \u0581 0, the statement of the lemma\nfollows just by increasing the value of C to take into account the small bound of the first\nsum (6.13).\n\u0003\n\n6.7 Measure of the points with bad recurrence\nWe are now ready to deduce exponentially slow approximation to the singular set S.\nIndeed we just have to use Tchebishev's inequality, as follows: given \u03b5, \u03b4 > 0 we know\nthere exists a constant C > 0 as in Subsection 6.5 such that\nn\u22121\nn\no\n\u0010\n\u0011\no n D\u03b4 (x)\n1X\n\u03b5o n\n\u03b4\nx\u2208M:\u2212\n= x : ezDn (x) \u2265 en\u03b5/C\n\u2265\nlog dist\u03b4 f i (x), S \u2265 \u03b5 \u2286 x : n\nn i=0\nn\nC\n\nhence\nZ\nn\u22121\no\nn\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1X\n\u03b4\n\u2212n\ni\n\u2212n\u03b5/C\nlog dist\u03b4 f (x), S \u2265 \u03b5 \u2264 e\nezDn d Leb = e\nLeb x \u2208 M : \u2212\nn i=0\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u03b5/C\u2212\u03b8(\u03b4)\n\nwhich can be made exponentially small by choosing \u03b4 > 0 small enough so that\n\u03b5/C > \u03b8(\u03b4). This proves that a piecewise expanding map f in our settings has exponentially slow recurrence to the singular set, completing the proof of the statements\nin Subsection 2.2 and of Corollary C after the reduction procedure of Subsection 2.4.\n\nReferences\n[1] J.
