Both examples are relevant to\nthe discussion of time-reversal symmetry breaking in unconventional superconductors,\nas well as for application in quantum computing.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nPairing symmetry of unconventional superconductors can produce time-reversal\nsymmetry breaking states. 1 Especially interesting are high Tc cuprates, with their dwave symmetry, since the recently developed technology 2 allows fabrication of such\nstructures, with controllable characteristics, as \u03c0-junctions, submicron size \"\u03c60 \"junctions 3 (i.e. junctions with equilibrium phase difference \u03c60 which is neither 0\nnor \u03c0), 4 \u03c0-SQUIDs 5 or \u03c0/2-SQUIDs, 6 and superconducting qubit prototypes. 7\nTherefore, quantitative prediction of properties of such restricted systems becomes\nrelevant not just from the theoretical point of view.\nGeneral approach to such calculations is based on Gorkov equations for Green's\nfunctions of the superconductor. It is limited only by the applicability of BCS-like\n\"mean field\" description of the superconducting state. This description is now\nconsidered valid on the phenomenological level, 8 independently from further developments in the first principles' theory of high Tc superconductivity. Quasiclassical\nlimit of these equations, Eilenberger equations, 9 is strictly speaking valid only when\na Also\n\nat Physics and Astronomy Dept., The University of British Columbia, 6224 Agricultural\nRd., Vancouver, B.C., V6T 1Z1, Canada.\n\n1\n\n\f|\u2206| \u226a EF ,. Unlike in conventional superconductors, this condition is not completely\nsatisfied in high Tc superconductors but is still a good approximation.\n2\n\nQuasiclassical Approach\n\nWe use the standard approach based on Eilenberger equations 9 for quasiclassical\nGreen's functions\nb b\nvF * \u2207b\ng + [\u03c9b\n\u03c43 + \u2206,\ng] = 0,\n(1)\n\nwith normalization condition b\ng 2 =b\n1, where \u03c9 is the Matsubara frequency and\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 0\ng f\n0 \u2206\nb\n\u03c4b3 =\n, b\ng=\n,\n\u2206\n=\n.\n0 \u22121\nf \u2020 \u2212g\n\u2206\u2020 0\n\nThe matrix Green's function gb and the superconducting order parameter \u2206 are both\nfunctions of the Fermi velocity vF and position r. \u2206 is determined by the (2D)\nself-consistency equation\nX\n\u2206(\u03b8) = 2\u03c0N (0)T\nhV\u03b8\u03b8\u2032 f (\u03b8\u2032 )i\u03b8\u2032\n\u03c9>0\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the angle between vF and the x-axis, V\u03b8\u03b8\u2032 interaction potential, N (0)\ndensity of states at the Fermi surface, and h...i\u03b8 represents averaging over \u03b8. Generally, it is possible to obtain a mixture of different symmetries of the order parameter, e.g. \u2206 = \u2206x2 \u2212y2 + \u2206xy + \u2206s where \u2206x2 \u2212y2 = \u22061 cos 2\u03b8, \u2206xy = \u22062 sin 2\u03b8,\nand \u2206s are the dominant dx2 \u2212y2 component, and the subdominant dxy and the\ns components of the order parameter respectively. The corresponding interaction\npotential, V\u03b8\u03b8\u2032 = Vd1 cos 2\u03b8 cos 2\u03b8\u2032 + Vd2 sin 2\u03b8 sin 2\u03b8\u2032 + Vs , must be substituted in\nthe self-consistency equation. The current density j(r) is found from g as\nX\nj = \u22124\u03c0ieN (0)T\nhvF gi\u03b8\n\u03c9>0\n\nFor numerical calculations, it is conventional 4,10,11 to parameterize the quasiclassical Green's functions by so called coherent functions a, b via\n2a\n1 \u2212 ab\n, f=\n.\n1 + ab\n1 + ab\nFunctions a and b satisfy two independent, but nonlinear, equations\ng=\n\nvF * \u2207a = \u2206 \u2212 \u2206\u2217 a2 \u2212 2\u03c9a\n\u2212vF * \u2207b = \u2206\u2217 \u2212 \u2206b2 \u2212 2\u03c9b.\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nFrom these equations it follows that a(\u2212vF ) = b\u2217 (vF ) and b(\u2212vF ) = a\u2217 (vF ). One\nshould solve these equations along all possible quasiclassical trajectories and perform\nthe summation over the trajectories to calculate the order parameter current density.\nTo find a and b along the trajectories, one needs to use boundary conditions at the\nends of the trajectories. In macroscopically large systems, one usually assumes that\n2\n\n\fFigure 1: Absolute values of the dominant (left) and subdominant (right) order parameters for\na small square d-wave super conductor in the presence of subdominant s-wave order parameter.\nThe orientation of the main order parameter is 45\u25e6 rotated with respect to the boundaries.\n\nall the trajectories go deep into the bulk of the superconductor, i.e., it is possible\nto use the bulk solutions\na\u00b1 =\n\n\u2206\n,\n\u03c9\u00b1\u03a9\n\nb\u00b1 =\n\n\u2206\u2217\n\u03c9\u00b1\u03a9\n\n(4)\n\np\nwith \u03a9 = \u03c9 2 + |\u2206|2 , as the boundary conditions at infinity. In the case of \"restricted\" systems, the above assumption is no longer self-evident. Nevertheless, we\nwill see that a stable numerical procedure can be still developed.\nNumerical calculation is stable if the integration for a (b) is taken in the (opposite) direction of vF . When \u2206 is a constant, the solution of Eq. (3) for a is\nai \u2212 a+\n\u2212 a\u2212 )e\u03a9\u03c4 sinh \u03a9\u03c4\n1+\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03a9 ai \u2212 a+\n\u2248 a+ + \u2217\ne\u22122\u03a9\u03c4 , for \u03a9\u03c4 \u226b 1\n\u2206\nai \u2212 a\u2212\n\naf = a+ +\n\n\u2206\u2217\n\u03a9 (ai\n\n(5)\n\nwhere ai and af are the values of a at the initial (ri ) and final (rf ) points of the\ntrajectory, and \u03c4 = |rf \u2212 ri |/vF is proportional to the distance between the initial\nand final points along the trajectory. It is clear that the solution for a relaxes to\nthe bulk value a+ at the distance L = vF /2\u03a9 which is of the order of the coherence\nlength \u03be0 . In other words, when the quasiparticle moves away from the initial point\nat a distance of a few \u03be0 's, any information about the initial point ai becomes lost.\nThis observation is also valid for b, and is crucial for what that follows.\nLet us now specifically consider a restricted system. After integrating over a few\n\u03be0 's, af will be almost independent of ai , although it may never coincide with the\nbulk value a+ . This solution corresponds to a simple exponential relaxation of the\nfunctions a and b to their local \"steady-state\" values defined by the local value of\nthe order parameter. This value is the limit for the functions a and b at this spatial\npoint. Such relaxation of Green's functions significantly simplifies the numerical\nsolution of the self-consistent two-dimensional problem. The system therefore has\nno memory of the local values of \u2206 beyond several \u03be0 along the trajectory.\nIn order to calculate a, we define all possible trajectories going through a given\npoint of the system. Along each of them we move back (in the direction opposite\n3\n\n\fFigure 2: Spontaneous current density (left) and magnetic field distribution (right) for the system\nof Fig. 1.\n\nto vF ) a cutoff distance (about 10\u03be0 \u2013 20\u03be0 ) and choose that point as the beginning\nof the trajectory. We set the bulk solution (a+ ) as the initial value for a at that\npoint (this really does not matter too much because the system has no memory) and\nintegrate along the trajectory, taking into account the reflections at the boundaries,\nuntil we get back to the calculation point. Calculation for b is the same, except that\nthe direction of integration is now opposite to vF . These calculations are repeated\nfor all trajectories and all points of the system (on a mesh). After each iteration,\nwe calculate the new \u2206 and use it for the next iteration until the self-consistency\nis achieved. We found this method to be very stable and independent of the value\nof the \"cutting\" distance. One should note that the above procedure is not valid in\nthe presence of magnetic field, because a path dependent phase will be accumulated\nto the Green's functions, and the above mentioned relaxation mechanism along the\ntrajectory does not work anymore.\n3\n\nResults\n\nTo illustrate the approach, we performed self-consistent calculations of the order\nparameter in a small (20\u03be0 \u00d7 20\u03be0 ) square region of d-wave superconductor in the\npresence of a subdominant s-wave order parameter. The crystalographic a and b\ndirections of the dominant order parameter make 45\u25e6 angle with respect to the\nboundaries of the square. We used a random subdominant order parameter at the\nfirst iteration in order to avoid imposing any assumption on the phase of the second\norder parameter.\nThe two components of the order parameter are displayed in Fig. 1. The dominant order parameter is suppressed at the boundaries of the square. This is due to\nthe special orientation of the order parameter which requires all quasiparticles to\nface opposite sign of the order parameter after reflecting from the boundaries. 4 As\na result, the subdominant order parameter (s) with a \u03c0/2 phase shift with respect\nto the dominant order parameter, is the main contributor at the boundaries. The\nspontaneous current distribution is displayed in Fig. 2. The current does not flow\nin the same direction at all the four edges, but changes the direction from one edge\n4\n\n\f30\n\n15\n\n0\n0\n\n15\n\nFigure 3: Absolute value of the order parameter for a grain boundary junction between two d-wave\nsuperconductors. The grain boundary is a vertical line located in the middle. The orientation of\nthe order parameter is 0\u25e6 on the left and 45\u25e6 on the right.\n\nto another closing its path towards the center of the square. The magnetic field\nproduced by the current is also shown in Fig. 2. The maximum value of the magnetic field is of the order of 10\u22123 G. Notice that the direction of the filed changes\nfrom one edge to another. Thus, the total flux produced by such a field is zero.\nWe also have calculated the spontaneous current and magnetic field distributions in a d-wave grain boundary junction. The system consists of a finite square\n(30\u03be0 \u00d730\u03be0 ) made of d-wave superconductor divided into two equal parts separated\nby a grain boundary junction. The order parameter has dx2 \u2212y2 symmetry with 0\u25e6\norientation on the left side of the grain boundary and 45\u25e6 on the right side. We\ninclude a dxy subdominant order parameter by adding an attraction potential in\nthat channel (see Ref. 4 ). The magnitude of potential is chosen in such a way to\nhave a transition temperature Tc2 = 0.1Tc (in the absence of the dominant order). 4\nWe choose a phase difference of \u2206\u03c6 = \u03c0/2 between the two sides. This actually\ncorresponds to the equilibrium phase difference of the junction at which the total\ncurrent passing through the junction is zero. 4 Calculations are done at T = 0.05Tc.\nThe results of calculation of the spontaneous current and magnetic field distributions are displayed in Fig. 3. Notice that the current is not symmetric with\nrespect to the grain boundary. On the left side (with 0\u25e6 orientation), the current\nreturns along the diagonal, whereas on the right side (45\u25e6 orientation) it forms two\nvortices and antivortices near the edges. These vortices are a consequence of the\nchiral nature of the d + id\u2032 symmetry. 4,10 Magnetic field is peaked at the location\nof vortices with a maximum of the order of 10\u22123 G. It is important to emphasize\nthat, unlike in the previous case, the existence of the spontaneous current in this\nsystem does not depend on the presence of a subdominant order parameter (although we assumed a subdominant component here). Addition of a subdominant\norder parameter will actually suppress the spontaneous current at the boundary\n(see Refs. 4,10 ).\n\n5\n\n\f4\n\nConclusions\n\nWe described a method to calculate equilibrium properties in finite size superconducting systems. We presented the results of our calculations for the distribution\nof spontaneous current and magnetic field in two systems: a small square region\nof a d-wave superconductor with a pair breaking boundary, and a d-wave grain\nboundary junctions between two differently oriented d-wave superconductors. The\nmethod described here is quite general and can be applied to any 2D geometry with\nproper boundary conditions. Presence of external magnetic field invalidates the\nmethod described here. The self-generated magnetic field due to the spontaneous\ncurrents, however, is usually very small so that its effect can be neglected in most\ncalculations.\nAcknowledgement\nWe would like to thank A.
