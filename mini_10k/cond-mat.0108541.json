Introduction\nThe non-exponential response of supercooled liquids and other systems exhibiting slow relaxation has been a topic of many investigations, cf.[1, 2]. At present, there seems to be\nconsencus about the fact that the primary or \u03b1-relaxation in supercooled liquids near the\ncalorimetric glass transition temperature Tg is of a heterogeneous nature[3, 4]. Several experimental techniques have been invented in order to monitor various aspects of these dynamic\nheterogeneities[5]. A supercooled liquid above Tg represents an ergodic system on long time\nscales. Therefore, the lifetime of the dynamic heterogeneities is finite. Up to now a couple of experimental methods exist that are able to detect these lifetimes. All of them are\nbased on the idea of selecting a sub-ensemble of slowly relaxing entities and monitor its\nre-equilibration afterwards. The development of such techniques started with the invention\nof reduced four-dimensional (4d) NMR[6], which subsequently has been applied to a number\nof glass-forming systems[7, 8, 9, 10]. Other relevant techniques are the deep-bleach experiment designed by Cicerone and Ediger[11] and the atomic force microscopy method used by\nRussell and Israeloff[12].\nA different experimental technique to monitor the dynamical behavior of liquids is provided by time-resolved fluorescence and phosphorescence spectroscopy, for a recent review\nsee[13]. After an initial optical excitation with a laser-pulse, the time-dependent emission\nspectra are observed, cf. Fig.1. Most theoretical investigations of time-resolved fluorescence have concentrated on the Stokes-shift correlation function, which is related to the\n\u2217\n\ndedicated to Prof. Hans Sillescu on occasion of his 65th birthday\n\n1\n\n\ftime-dependent mean h\u03c9(t)i of the emission spectrum:\nC(t) =\n\nh\u03c9(t)i \u2212 h\u03c9(\u221e)i\nh\u03c9(0)i \u2212 h\u03c9(\u221e)i\n\n(1)\n\nIn particular, the dependence of C(t) on molecular variables of the solvent have been investigated for both, polar[14, 15, 16, 17, 18] and nonpolar solvation[19, 20], see also the list of\nreferences in ref.[13].\nIn the field of supercooled liquids, triplet state solvation experiments have been applied.\nThe observed behavior of the time-resolved inhomogeneous broadening of the optical lines has\nbeen interpreted in terms of dynamic heterogeneities[21, 22, 23]. For one well studied system,\nquinoxaline (QX) in supercooled 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF), it has been concluded\nthat the lifetime of the dynamic heterogeneities or the 're-equilibration time', h\u03c4req i, exceeds\nthe mean time scale of the \u03b1-relaxation, h\u03c4\u03b1 i, considerably[24, 25]. This is a somewhat\nsurprising result for the following reasons. In all 4d-NMR experiments, performed on a\nvariety of glassformers, ranging from polymers[6] to simple molecular liquids[8], h\u03c4req i \u2243 h\u03c4\u03b1 i\nhas been found. Furthermore, a strong temperature dependence of h\u03c4req i has been observed\nin the deep-bleach experiments. These techniques cover the temperature range in which\nthe solvation experiments have been performed. Therefore, MTHF is assumed to behave\ndifferent from all systems studied so far. In addition, the finding of a long h\u03c4req i relies on a\npurely phenomenological interpretation of the data in terms of a very special model[23, 25].\nIt is the purpose of the present paper to present a sound theoretical description of timedependent optical line shapes in complex systems. The actual calculation is based on a socalled inhomogeneous cumulant expansion[26]. The results obtained bear a formal similarity\nto those of ref.[23], thus partly validating the phenomological approach used there. In order\nto illustrate the general results, I then treat the optical transition frequencies as a nonMarkovian stochastic process and calculate the relevant quantities in terms of a free-energy\nlandscape model for the primary relaxation[27, 28, 29, 30]. The outline of the paper is\nas follows. In the next section I will give a theoretical description of optical lineshapes in\nthe inhomogeneous limit in terms of an inhomogeneous cumulant expansion. Some formal\naspects of the derivation are treated in Appendix A. Sect. III gives a brief description of\nthe free-energy landscape model which then is used to calculate the relevant quantities. The\nresults are discussed in Sect. IV and the paper closes with some conclusions.\n\nII. Theory of time-dependent optical lineshapes\nIn this section the theory of time-dependent optical lineshapes in the inhomogeneous cumulant expansion will be presented. Throughout the discussion the inhomogeneous limit will\nbe considered exclusively and vibronic regressions and also the finite lifetime of the excited\nstate will be neglected. This means, I focus on the time evolution of the (slow, h\u03c4\u03b1 i longer\nthan roughly 10\u22128 s) solvent relaxation. To this end, the following simplified Hamiltonian of\na two-state electronic system is considered:\nH = |gi[H0 + Wg ]hg| + |ei[H0 + We + h\u0304\u03c9eg ]he|\n\n(2)\n\nHere, the electronic ground and excited state are denoted by |gi and |ei, respectively. H0 is\nthe solvent Hamiltonian in the absence of the solute, Wg and We denote the solute-solvent\n2\n\n\finteractions in the respective electronic states of the solute and h\u0304\u03c9eg is the 0\u22120 transition\nfrequency of the solvated solute. In the following, h\u0304 will be set to unity. In Appendix A\nthe time-dependent optical lineshape is calculated from the third order (in the electric field)\nresponse[17, 18] in the rotating wave approximation. In the inhomogeneous limit both, timedependent fluorescence (|ei = |S1 i) and phosphorescence (|ei = |T1 i) can be treated on the\nsame footing. In the latter case it has to be assumed additionally that intersystem crossing\nand internal conversion are much faster than any other relevant time scale. For systems\nwith slow environmental relaxation with typical relaxation times in the ms * * * s regime this\nprovides no severe restriction.\nIn this section the optical emission lineshape will be calculated within the framework of\nan inhomogeneous cumulant expansion[26] starting from\nI(\u03c9, t) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nd\u03c90 P (\u03c9, t|\u03c90)Sg (\u03c90 )\n\n(3)\n\nHere, Sg (\u03c9) denotes the initial absorption spectrum, usually approximated by the initial\n(non-equilibrium) emission spectrum. Additionally, P (\u03c9, t|\u03c90) is the conditional probability\nfor finding the transition frequency \u03c9 at time t given it had the value \u03c90 at time t = 0.\nP (\u03c9, t|\u03c90) can be cast in the form\n1\nP (\u03c9, t|\u03c90) = 2\n4\u03c0 Se (\u03c90 )\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nd\u03c41\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nd\u03c42 e\u2212i\u03c90 \u03c41 ei\u03c9\u03c42 hei\u03c9(0)\u03c41 e\u2212i\u03c9(t)\u03c42 ie\n\n(4)\n\nwhich follows immediately from the definition of the joint probability, P (\u03c9, t|\u03c90)Se (\u03c90 ) =\nh\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9(t))\u03b4(\u03c90 \u2212 \u03c9(0))ie with hAie = T r[A\u03c1e ], cf. Appendix A and ref.[20]. In Appendix\nA, Eq.(3) is derived from the general expression for the third order response and the inhomogeneous cumulant expansion is performed in detail, yielding Eqns.(A.5, A.7) for the\nlineshape.\nEq.(4) allows to discuss the formal connection to observables of other experimental techniques such as 2d-NMR. In this case, the conditional probability P (\u03c9L , t|\u03c9L\u2032 ) with \u03c9L denoting the Larmor frequency is observed directly[31]. In contrast to the optical case in NMR\nthe dependence of \u03c9L on molecular orientation is known explicitly and equilibrium correlation functions of the form hei\u03c9L (0)\u03c41 e\u2212i\u03c9L (t)\u03c42 i are accessible directly. As is well known[31],\n2d-NMR spectra are not able to provide information about dynamic heterogeneities let alone\ntheir lifetimes. This is because in order to address this question one has to probe the system\nat four points in time at least[32]. It was this knowledge that led to the invention of higherdimensional NMR techniques[6]. It is important to note that according to Eqns.(3,4) I(\u03c9, t)\ndoes not contain any information about molecular motions beyond the two-time correlation functions hei\u03c9(0)\u03c41 e\u2212i\u03c9(t)\u03c42 ie and therefore cannot provide further insight into the issue\nconcerning the lifetime of dynamic heterogeneities. Furthermore, due to the complex dependence of \u03c9(t) on all relative distances and orientations of the solute relative to the solvent\nmolecules, the optical lineshapes can be interpreted in terms of molecular quantities in a simple way only in favourable cases. An example is the relation between the solvation coordinate\nand the dielectric properties of the solvent in case of polar solvation[13, 14, 15, 16, 17].\nNow, I proceed to perform an inhomogeneous cumulant expansion of Eq.(4). For this\npurpose the Taylor expansion of the phase correlation function hei\u03c9(0)\u03c41 e\u2212i\u03c9(t)\u03c42 ie is considered. Setting h\u03c9ie = 0 and \u03c3e2 = h\u03c9 2ie without loss of generality, one has in a first order\n3\n\n\fapproximation\nhei\u03c9(0)\u03c41 e\u2212i\u03c9(t)\u03c42 ie \u2243 1 \u2212 (\u03c3e2 /2)(\u03c412 + \u03c422 ) + \u03c3e2 C(t)\u03c41 \u03c42\nwith the Stokes-shift correlation function given by:\nC(t) = h\u03c9(t)\u03c9(0)ie/\u03c3e2\n\n(5)\n\nThe non-exponential decay of C(t) can conveniently be parametrized via a Kohlrausch function, C(t) = exp [(\u2212(t/\u03c4K )\u03b2K )]. This can be rewritten as\nC(t) =\n\nZ\n\nd\u03bbp(\u03bb)e\u2212\u03bbt\n\n(6)\n\nwith relaxation ratesR \u03bb and a distribution function p(\u03bb).

Exponentiating the expression\nin the curly brackets gives:\nR\n\ni\u03c90 (0)\u03c41 \u2212i\u03c9(t)\u03c42\n\nhe\n\ne\n\nie \u2243\n\nZ\n\n\u03c32\nd\u03bbp(\u03bb) exp \u2212 e [\u03c412 + \u03c422 \u2212 2e\u2212\u03bbt \u03c41 \u03c42 ]\n2\n(\n\n)\n\n(7)\n\nIt is illustrative to compare this result with the corresponding one of an ordinary cumulant\nexpansion. In this case one finds, without using Eq.(6)\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\nhei\u03c9(0)\u03c41 e\u2212i\u03c9(t)\u03c42 ie \u2243 e\u2212(\u03c3e /2)[(\u03c41 +\u03c42 \u22122\u03c41 \u03c42 C(t)]\nTherefore, this expansion does not take into account\nthe inhomogeneities reflected\nin Eq.(6).\nR\nR\nIn the same way as an expansion of the form C(t) \u2243 d\u03bbp(\u03bb)(1\u2212\u03bbt) \u2243 exp [\u2212( d\u03bbp(\u03bb)\u03bb)t] only\nyields an exponential decay the ordinary cumulant expansion can only produce Gaussian\nprobability distributions. The inhomogeneous cumulant expansion instead allows one to\naccount for a more complex behavior[26].\nPerforming the Fourier transform in Eq.(4), using Eq.(7), yields for the conditional probability:\nP (\u03c9, t|\u03c90) =\n\nZ\n\nd\u03bbp(\u03bb)P(\u03bb) (\u03c9, t|\u03c90)\n\n[\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90 e\u2212\u03bbt ]2\nexp \u2212 2\nP(\u03bb) (\u03c9, t|\u03c90) = q\n2\u03c3e (1 \u2212 e\u22122\u03bbt )\n2\u03c0\u03c3e2 (1 \u2212 e\u22122\u03bbt )\n1\n\n!\n\n(8)\n\nNote that Eq.(8) is the same as Eq.(A.8) for \u03c3e2 (\u0393) = \u03c3e2 independent of the environmental\nvariable \u0393, which in Eq.(8) corresponds to \u03bb. It is important to notice that both, the distribution p(\u03bb) and the decay rates \u03bb are determined via the Stokes correlation function C(t).\nIn particular, the decomposition of P (\u03c9, t|\u03c90) into the functions P(\u03bb) (\u03c9, t|\u03c90) is meaningful\nonly if the \u03bb are static quantities. This means that the influence of possible exchange processes has to be incorporated in the definition of these rates. Thus, in exchange models that\nstart from bare relaxation rates which are modified due to exchange, the \u03bb are the effective\nrelaxation rates and p(\u03bb) the effective distribution. This will be further discussed below.\nFinally, the time independent absorption and emission spectra are given by:\n1\n2\n2\ne\u2212(\u03c9\u2212\u2206) /(2\u03c3g )\nSg (\u03c9) = q\n2\u03c0\u03c3g2\n\n1\n2\n2\nand Se (\u03c9) = peq (\u03c9) = q\ne\u2212\u03c9 /(2\u03c3e )\n2\u03c0\u03c3e2\n4\n\n(9)\n\n\fwhere \u2206 = h\u03c9ig denoted the overall red-shift. Additionally, \u03c3g2 = h(\u03c9 \u2212 \u2206)2 ig , \u03c3e2 = h\u03c9 2ie\nand h\u03c9ie = 0 has been used without loss of generality. In Eq.(9) the spectrum Se (\u03c9) is\ndetermined by ensemble averages with respect to the excited-state Hamiltonian, because the\nsystem occupies this state before photon-emission.\nUsing the result of the inhomogeneous cumulant expansion, Eq.(8), in Eq.(3) gives a\nsuperposition of Gaussians for the optical lineshape I(\u03c9, t). The expectation value of any\ndynamical variable A can then be calculated according to\nhA(t)i =\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c9A(\u03c9)I(\u03c9, t) =\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c9\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c90A(\u03c9)P (\u03c9, t|\u03c90)Sg (\u03c90 )\n\n(10)\n\nFrom this one finds the nth frequency moment using A = \u03c9 n . The time-dependent mean is\ndirectly related to the Stokes-shift correlation function,\nZ\n\nh\u03c9(t)i = \u2206\u00d7C(t) = \u2206\u00d7 d\u03bbp(\u03bb)e\u2212\u03bbt\n\n(11)\n\nand the second moment to C(2t):\n2\n\nh\u03c9 (t)i =\n\n\u03c3e2\n\n2\n\n+ (\u2206 +\n\n\u03c3g2\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c3e2 )C(2t)\n\nwhere C(2t) =\n\nZ\n\nd\u03bbp(\u03bb)e\u22122\u03bbt\n\n(12)\n\nTherefore, the time-dependent variance is given by:\nh\n\n\u03c3 2 (t) = \u03c3e2 + (\u03c3g2 \u2212 \u03c3e2 )C(t)2 + \u22062 C(2t) \u2212 C(t)2\n\ni\n\n(13)\n\nThis expression was found to give excellent agreement with the experimentally observed\nlinewidth in the triplet state solvation studies on supercooled liquids[13, 21, 24].\nThe results for the optical lineshape and the frequency moments obtained above and in\nAppendix A can be reduced to expressions given earlier in the literature. If there is only one\nvalue for the environmental variable \u0393 (or \u03bb) Eq.(A.5) reduces to the expression already given\nabove[20, 33]. Note that C(t) does not necessarily decay exponentially in this case. This\nresult is obtained by performing an ordinary cumulant expansion, cf. the discussion above.\nIn that case the variance is given by \u03c3 2 (t) = \u03c3e2 + (\u03c3g2 \u2212 \u03c3e2 )C(t)2 and changes monotonously\nfrom \u03c3 2 (0) = \u03c3g2 to \u03c3 2 (\u221e) = \u03c3e2 because of C(0) = 1 and C(\u221e) = 0.\nThe result for the P(\u03bb) (\u03c9, t|\u03c90) derived above, Eq.(8), can be mapped onto an expression\ngiven by Richert[23] if his loosely defined 'local response functions' \u03c7(t, \u03c4 ) are replaced by\ne\u2212\u03bbt . This point will be discussed further below. Of course, in any theoretical calculation\nof a conditional probability one can only obtain approximations to the two-time correlation\nfunction hei\u03c9(0)\u03c41 e\u2212i\u03c9(t)\u03c42 i. In a second order cumulant expansion the information is further\nreduced to the autocorrelation function h\u03c9(t)\u03c9(0)i. As mentioned already above, no twotime correlation function is able to provide any information about the lifetime of dynamic\nheterogeneity.\n\nIII. A free-energy landscape model for the optical lineshape\nIn order to illustrate the results derived above in this section the transition frequencies \u03c9(t)\nare treated as a non-Markovian stochastic process. For this purpose I consider the description\nof \u03c9(t) in terms of a free-energy landscape model. This approach has been used previously to\n5\n\n\fdescribe several aspects of the \u03b1-relaxation in supercooled liquids[27, 28]. The basic idea is\nthe following. The \u03b1-relaxation is assumed to be associated with activated transitions among\nan extensive number of metastable glassy states or valleys in the free-energy landscape[34].\nThis activated dynamics is described as a stochastic process \u01eb(t). For simplicity, \u01eb(t) is\nmodeled as a stationary Markov process. The corresponding master equation (ME) for the\nconditional probability (Green's function) G(\u01eb, t|\u01eb0 ) \u2261 P1|1 (\u01eb; t|\u01eb0 ) then reads[35]:\n\u2202\nG(\u01eb, t|\u01eb0 ) =\n\u2202t\n\nZ\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nd\u01eb \u03ba(\u01eb|\u01eb )G(\u01eb , t|\u01eb0 ) \u2212 \u03ba(\u01eb)G(\u01eb, t|\u01eb0 ) with \u03ba(\u01eb) =\n\nZ\n\nd\u01eb\u2032 \u03ba(\u01eb\u2032 |\u01eb)\n\n(14)\n\nHere, \u03ba(\u01eb|\u01eb\u2032 ) denotes the rate for a \u01eb\u2032 \u2192 \u01eb-transition. The dynamics described by Eq.(14)\nis supposed to be relevant for the environmental relaxation of the system. Of course, such\na model can be applied to any system exhibiting activated dynamics, e.g. proteins, if the\n\u03ba(\u01eb|\u01eb\u2032 ) are chosen appropriately. In the following calculations I choose a simple globally\nconnected model[27] for the kinetics. After an escape out of valley (initial state \u01eb\u2032 ) with an\nactivation energy (EA \u2212 \u01eb\u2032 ) any other valley (final state \u01eb) can be reached with a probability\n2\n2\ngiven by its density of states, \u03b7(\u01eb) \u221d e\u2212\u01eb /2\u03c3(\u01eb) :\n\u03ba(\u01eb|\u01eb\u2032 ) = k\u221e \u03b7(\u01eb)e\u03b2\u01eb\n\n\u2032\n\n(15)\n\nHere, k\u221e is a prefactor and \u03b2 = (kBoltzmann T )\u22121 . In ref.[27] other models have been considered\nalso.\nThe main assumption of the model is that if x(t) is a process observed experimentally,\nthen x(t) is allowed to change its value solely due to the \u01eb\u2032 \u2192 \u01eb transitions. Therefore, x(t)\ncan be considered as a 'slave process' of \u01eb(t)[36]. In particular, x(t) is not Markovian. In this\ncontext it is to be mentioned that in terms of Heuers Q parameter[32], which is a measure\nof how long a relaxation rate remains correlated to earlier values, this model corresponds to\nQ = 1 by definition, i.e. h\u03c4req i = h\u03c4\u03b1i. Previously, mainly the orientation of tagged particles,\nx(t) = \u03a9(t), and the position, x(t) = ~r(t), have been considered[27, 28]. In the present\npaper, x(t) is identified with the optical transition frequencies, x(t) = \u03c9(t). In order to\ndescribe the dynamics of \u03c9(t), different approaches can be used.\nA. Langevin equations\nA simple approach is to assign a value \u03c9\u01eb (t) to each of the valleys \u01eb and consider the coupled\nLangevin equations:\n\u03c9\u0307\u01eb (t) = \u2212\u03ba(\u01eb)\u03c9\u01eb (t) +\n\nZ\n\nd\u01eb\u2032 \u03ba(\u01eb|\u01eb\u2032 )\u03c9\u01eb\u2032 (t) + L\u01eb (t)\n\n(16)\n\nwhere L\u01eb (t) is a delta-correlated white noise, hL\u01eb (t)i = 0, hL\u01eb (t)L\u01eb\u2032 (t\u2032 )i = \u0393\u01eb,\u01eb\u2032 \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ). For a\nfinite number of valleys, the integral in Eq.(16) is to be replaced by a sum. After diagonalization of the matrix defined in Eq.(16) one has the decoupled Langevin equations\n\u03c9\u0307\u03bb (t) = \u2212\u03bb\u03c9\u03bb (t) + L\u03bb (t)\n\n(17)\n\nwhere \u03bb are the eigenvalues. These equations are directly related to Gaussian conditional\nprobabilities[35, 37], determined by the correlation functions h\u03c9\u03bb (t)\u03c9\u03bb (0)i = \u03c3e2e\u2212\u03bbt . Therefore, these Langevin equations yield Eq.(8) without further approximations. Due to the\n6\n\n\fstructure of Eq.(16) the p(\u03bb) are determined by the G(\u01eb, t|\u01eb0 ), cf. Eq.(14). In an actual\ncalculation, one needs to specify how the transition frequencies \u03c9\u01eb (t) depend on the environmental variables \u01eb. A very simple choice would be to neglect any correlation between\n\u03c9(t) and \u01eb(t)[38]. Without going into details of an actual calculation here, it suffices to note\nthat for any such 'Langevin model' the inhomogeneous cumulant expansion is exact. This\nis because in a Langevin approach one starts from Gaussian fluctuations from the outset\nand \u03c9(t) represents a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process[37]. This means that \u03c9(t)\nis a non-Markovian Gaussian process. As a consequence, Eq.(8) results for the conditional\nprobability.\nB. Master equations\nAnother approach allowing for a richer dynamics is to consider the ME for the composite\nMarkov process {\u03c9(t), \u01eb(t)} as has been done previously[27, 28]. As will be shown below,\nin contrast to the Langevin equations considered above, in such an approach \u03c9(t) is nonGaussian in general. In the ME, the transition rates \u03ba(\u03c9, \u01eb|\u03c9 \u2032, \u01eb\u2032 ) are chosen as simple\nproducts, \u03ba(\u03c9, \u01eb|\u03c9 \u2032, \u01eb\u2032 ) = \u03ba(\u01eb|\u01eb\u2032 )\u039b(\u03c9|\u03c9 \u2032). Here, the dimensionless functions \u039b(\u03c9|\u03c9 \u2032) determine\nthe magnitude of changes in \u03c9 associated with a \u01eb\u2032 \u2192 \u01eb-transition. Allowing only for very\nsmall frequency changes, \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c9 \u2032 = \u03c9 +\u03b4, \u03b4 \u226a 1, one can use a Kramers-Moyal expansion of\nthe ME as described in Appendix B. As a result, the following equation for the conditional\nprobability is obtained:\n\u1e561|1 (\u03c9, \u01eb; t|\u03c90, \u01eb0 ) = \u2212\u03ba(\u01eb)P1|1 (\u03c9, \u01eb; t|\u03c90, \u01eb0 )\nh\n\n+ 1 + \u03c1\u039b\n\nFP\n\n(\u03c9)\n\niZ\n\nd\u01eb\u2032 \u03ba(\u01eb|\u01eb\u2032 )P1|1 (\u03c9, \u01eb\u2032 ; t|\u03c90 , \u01eb0 )\n\n(18)\n\nwhere the Fokker Planck (FP)-operator \u039bF P (\u03c9) is defined by:\n\u039bF P (\u03c9) =\n\n\u22022\n\u2202\n\u03c9 + \u03c3e2 2\n\u2202\u03c9\n\u2202\u03c9\n\n(19)\n\nand\n\n\u03b42\n(20)\n2\u03c3e2\nThe 'fluctuation parameter' \u03c1 \u226a 1 measures the scale of the \u03c9-fluctuations relative to the\nwidth of the equilibrium distribution. An analytic solution of Eq.(18) is not feasible in\ngeneral. However, one can perform an expansion in terms of the eigenfunctions of \u039bF P (\u03c9)\nwhich are Hermite polynomials Hn (z)[37]:\n\u03c1=\n\nP1|1 (\u03c9, \u01eb; t|\u03c90, \u01eb0 ) = e\u2212\u03c9\u0304\n\n2\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=0\n\nHn (\u03c9\u0304)Hn (\u03c9\u03040 )\nq\n\n2n n!\n\n2\n2\u03c0\u03c3\u221e\n\n2\nGn (\u01eb, t|\u01eb0 ) where \u03c9\u0304 2 = \u03c9 2 /2\u03c3\u221e\n\n(21)\n\nThe Green's functions Gn (\u01eb, t|\u01eb0 ) are the solutions of the rate equations:\n\u0120n (\u01eb, t|\u01eb0 ) = \u2212\u03ba(\u01eb)Gn (\u01eb, t|\u01eb0 ) + [1 \u2212 n\u03c1]\n\nZ\n\nd\u01eb\u2032 \u03ba(\u01eb|\u01eb\u2032 )Gn (\u01eb\u2032 , t|\u01eb0 )\n\n(22)\n\nNote that G0 (\u01eb, t|\u01eb0 ) \u2261 G(\u01eb, t|\u01eb0 ) according to Eq.(14). A comparison of these rate equations\nwith those occurring in the treatment of molecular reorientations shows that the term n\u03c1\n7\n\n\fcorresponds to Pl (cos \u03b8), the lth order Legendre polynomial of the jump angle \u03b8. A full\nsolution of the problem requires the calculation of all Gn (\u01eb, t|\u01eb0 ), n = 0, 1, * * * , \u221e. From\nthis solution the stochastic process \u03c9(t) can be defined as a projection of the composite\nMarkov process {\u03c9(t), \u01eb(t)}. For this purpose one has to integrate the joint probabilities\nover the variables \u01eb. In the special case of uncorrelated equilibrium probabilites, peq (\u03c9, \u01eb) =\npeq (\u03c9)peq (\u01eb), this yields the marginal distributions[27]\nZ\n\nP (\u03c9, t|\u03c90) =\n\nZ\n\neq\n\nd\u01eb0 p (\u01eb0 ) d\u01ebP1|1 (\u03c9, \u01eb; t|\u03c90, \u01eb0 )\n\n(23)\n\nFrom this expression and Eqns.(21, 22) it becomes clear that P (\u03c9, t|\u03c90) can not be written\nas a superposition of Gaussians. This shows that even though Eq.(18) resembles a FokkerPlanck equation, \u03c9(t) is not only non-Markovian but also non-Gaussian in general.\nInhomogeneous cumulant expansion\n\nThe non-Gaussian nature of the stochastic process \u03c9(t) in the approach starting from a\nME allows to discuss the inhomogeneous cumulant expansion in detail. For this purpose\nI proceed in exactly the same manner as in Sect.II. There, it became clear that the only\nrelevant quantity determining the conditional probability is the frequency autocorrelation\nfunction. Using the properties of the Hermite polynomials, this function can be calculated\nfrom Eq.(21):\nh\u03c9(t)\u03c9(0)i =\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c90peq (\u03c90 )\u03c90\n\n= \u03c3e2\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c9\u03c9P (\u03c9, t|\u03c90) = \u03c3e2\n\nZ\n\nd\u01eb0 peq (\u01eb0 ) d\u01eb\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nd\u01eb0 peq (\u01eb0 )\n\nZ\n\nd\u01ebG1 (\u01eb, t|\u01eb0 )\n\n(24)\n\n(1) t\n\nd\u03bb(1) \u03a6(1) (\u01eb, \u03bb(1) )\u03a8(1) (\u01eb0 , \u03bb(1) )e\u2212\u03bb\n\nHere, \u03a6(1) (\u01eb, \u03bb(1) ) and \u03a8(1) (\u01eb0 , \u03bb(1) ) are the right and left eigenvectors of the matrix defined\nin Eq.(22) for n = 1. The \u03bb(1) are the corresponding eigenvalues. Performing the same\ncalculation as in Sect.II, one recovers Eq.(8) for the conditional probability, P (\u03c9, t|\u03c90), with\n(1)\n\np(\u03bb ) =\n\nZ\n\neq\n\nZ\n\nd\u01eb0 p (\u01eb0 ) d\u01eb\u03a6(1) (\u01eb, \u03bb(1) )\u03a8(1) (\u01eb0 , \u03bb(1) )\n\n(25)\n\nThus, the inhomogeneous cumulant expansion provides an explicit expression for the 'distribution of relaxation rates', p(\u03bb).\nNote, that a Gaussian approximationR is equivalent to approximating the Green's func(1)\ntions Gn (\u01eb, t|\u01eb0 ), n > 1, by Gn (\u01eb, t|\u01eb0 ) \u2243 d\u03bb1 \u03a6(1) (\u01eb, \u03bb(1) )\u03a8(1) (\u01eb0 , \u03bb(1) )e\u2212n\u03bb t . Inserting this\nexpression into Eq.(21) allows one to compute the sum over n resulting in a Gaussian[37].\nUsing Eq.(23) yields Eq.(8) with p(\u03bb) given by Eq.(25). It is important to point out that\nthe frequency autocorrelation function, Eq.(24), also determines the conditional probability\nin an ordinary cumulant expansion, cf. the discussion in Sect.II. Therefore, in the present\ncontext Eq.(8) is the result of an inhomogeneous Gaussian approximation.\nIn general the assumption of Gaussian fluctuations presents an approximation, only.\nThere are, however, two limits in which \u03c9(t) becomes a Gaussian stochastic process. As\nshown in Appendix C a perturbation expansion of Eq.(22) yields a Gaussian probability\ndistribution in the limits of short and long times, respectively.\nIn the short time limit, one has to replace the rates \u03bb in Eq.(8) by \u03c1\u03ba(\u01eb) and to set p(\u03bb) =\npeq (\u01eb). The relaxation rates are therefore determined by the escape rates \u03ba(\u01eb). This means\n8\n\n\fthat any single \u01eb \u2192 \u01eb\u2032 transition is effective for the relaxation of the transition frequencies\n\u03c9(t). This limit therefore corresponds to a situation in which the \u03c9(t) fluctuate in a quasistatic environment.\nR\nIn the long time limit, only the average relaxation rate, \u03c1h\u03bai = d\u01eb\u03ba(\u01eb), determines the\ntemporal behavior of P (\u03c9, t|\u03c90) and one has to set p(\u03bb) = \u03b4(\u03bb\u2212\u03c1h\u03bai) in Eq.(8). Therefore, in\nthis limit \u03c9(t) is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process[35] which means that \u03c9(t) is Markovian and\nGaussian in this limit. Only the time scale for relaxation is set by the mean environmental\nrelaxation rate h\u03bai.\nThe inhomogeneous Gaussian approximation discussed above smoothly interpolates between these two limits, if \u03c1 \u226a 1. Here, the difference between an inhomogeneous cumulant\nexpansion and an ordinary one can be seen most clearly. In both cases the correct long time\nlimit is approached, as is well known from the theory of random walks[35]. The correct short\ntime limit, however, is only reached if the inhomogeneous cumulant expansion is performed.\nModel calculations\n\nIn Fig.2 the Stokes-shift correlation function C(t), calculated according to Eq.(24), and\nthe time-dependent part of the variance, Eq.(13), are shown for \u03c1 = 0.1 and \u03c3g = \u03c3e . The\nparameters, \u03ba\u221e and \u03c3(\u01eb), cf. Eq.(15), are chosen in such a way that C(t) is well parametrized\nby a Kohlrausch function, C(t) = exp [\u2212(t/\u03c4K )\u03b2K ]. For the curves with \u03b2K = 0.5, the choice\nwas guided by the experimental results of Wendt and Richert on triplet state solvation in\nMTHF[24]. As already mentioned in the last section, the shown behavior for C(2t)\u2212C(t)2 =\n[\u03c3 2 (t)\u2212\u03c3e2 ]/\u22062 is in excellent agreement with the experimental data. Comparing the different\ncurves in Fig.2, it is seen that for more stretched C(t) the range of positive C(2t) \u2212 C(t)2\nis increased. Also the absolute value increases with decreasing \u03b2K . Without showing the\nresults of calculations for other choices of the fluctuation parameter \u03c1 here I just mention\nthat this has only a small effect on the overall behavior if \u03c1 is not chosen too large. In\nthis latter case, however, the Kramers-Moyal expansion is no longer meaningful and Eq.(18)\nceases to be valid.\nAs has been pointed out, the solution of Eq.(18) results in a stochastic process \u03c9(t) that\nis not only non-Markovian, but also non-Gaussian. A detailed study of the deviations from\nGaussian behavior of the exact solution of Eq.(18) is difficult in general. However, one can\ncompare the low-order moments calculated in the inhomogeneous Gaussian approximation,\nEqns.(8,25), with those obtained using the exact Eqns.(21,22). In a way similar to the\ncalculation of h\u03c9(t)\u03c9(0)i one finds for \u03c3e = \u03c3g\nh\u03c9(t)i(N G) = \u2206\u00d7C(t) and h\u03c9 2(t)i(N G) = \u03c3e2 + \u22062\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nd\u01ebpeq (\u01eb) d\u01eb0 G2 (\u01eb, t|\u01eb0 )\n\n(26)\n\nThe first moment of course coincides with the Gaussian approximation, Eq.(11), h\u03c9(t)i(N G) \u2261\nh\u03c9(t)i. For the second moment and the variance, \u03c3 2 (t), this is not true. Here, Eq.(13) has\nto be compared to\n2\n\n\u03c3 (t)(N G) =\n\n\u03c3e2\n\n2\n\n+ \u2206 \u03be(t) where \u03be(t) =\n\nZ\n\neq\n\nZ\n\nd\u01ebp (\u01eb) d\u01eb0 G2 (\u01eb, t|\u01eb0 ) \u2212 C(t)2\n\n(27)\n\nThis quantity is plotted in Fig.3(a) for the same parameters as used in Fig.2 for \u03b2K = 0.5\nalong with C(2t) \u2212 C(t)2 for comparison. It is clearly seen that \u03be(t) exceeds C(2t) \u2212 C(t)2\n9\n\n\fin the whole range where both functions are nonzero. In order to qualitatively discuss\nhigher order\nmoments h\u03c9 n (t)i(N G) it is sufficient to notice that these are determined by\nR\nR\neq\nd\u01ebp (\u01eb) d\u01eb0 Gn (\u01eb, t|\u01eb0 ), as can be seen from Eq.(21). Therefore, the functions\n\u03b6n (t) =\n\nZ\n\neq\n\nZ\n\nd\u01ebp (\u01eb) d\u01eb0 Gn (\u01eb, t|\u01eb0 ) \u2212 C(nt)\n\n(28)\n\ngive a qualitative measure for the deviations of h\u03c9 n (t)i(N G) from a Gaussian behavior. This\nis because in the Gaussian approximation the \u03b6n (t) vanish identically, \u03b6n (t) \u2261 0. The \u03b6n (t)\nare plotted in Fig.3(b) for n = 2, 4, 6, 8. From this plot it is evident that the deviations from\nGaussian behavior even increase with n. Thus, if one wants to go beyond the Gaussian\napproximation, it is not sufficient to consider only the first few moments. In particular, the\nsecond moment gives only a poor approximation to the inhomogeneous linewidth. Additionally, the Stokes-shift correlation function is no longer determined by the first moment but\nalso higher moments become important. However, it should be kept in mind that if higher\norder terms are kept in the cumulant expansion of P (\u03c9, t|\u03c90), these terms also have to be\ntaken into account for the static spectra Se (\u03c9) for reasons of internal consistency, cf. the discussion in Appendix A. As will be discussed further below, it is the identification of \u03c3 2 (t)(N G)\nwith the inhomogeneous linewidth for one special exchange model that let Richert[25] to the\nincorrect conclusion that models with h\u03c4req i \u2243 h\u03c4\u03b1 i are incompatible with the experimental\ndata obtained for QX in MTHF[24].\n\nIV. Discussion\nIn Sect.II and Appendix A an inhomogeneous cumulant expansion has been performed to\ncalculate the time-dependent optical linewidths in complex systems like supercooled liquids\nor proteins. Because the expansion has been truncated at second order, the transition\nfrequencies \u03c9(t) constitute a stochastic process that is Gaussian but non-Markovian in this\napproximation. In Sect.III the theoretical results have been illustrated by a specific stochastic\nmodel for \u03c9(t). The coupling of these frequencies to the environmental fluctuations, treated\nin terms of the free-energy landscape model, renders \u03c9(t) non-Markovian. The same is true\nif exchange models are considered instead[39].\nIn theoretical treatments of polar solvation[15, 16, 17] a simple interpretation of the\ntime-dependent Stokes shift C(t) and accordingly the solvation coordinate is given in terms\nof the dielectric properties of the solvent. If the solvation coordinate can be modeled\nas a Gaussian Markov process, also the interpretation in terms of solvation free energies\nis straightforward[15, 17]. This, however, usually leads to exponential relaxation. If instead the Stokes-shift correlation function decays non-exponentially, such a simple relation\nis no longer obvious as in this case the solvation coordinate does not constitute a Markov\nprocess. Rewriting the non-exponentially decaying Stokes-shift correlation function as in\nEq.(6) still\nallows to relate C(t) to the dielectric response via an expression of the form\nR\nC(t) \u223c d\u03bbp(\u03bb) exp (\u2212t/\u03c4diel (\u03bb)). Here, \u03c4diel (\u03bb) denote dielectric relaxation times, the values of which depend on the model considered[13]. Thus, the treatment of \u03c9(t) as a projection\nfrom a higher-dimensional Markov process along with the inhomogeneous cumulant expansion might be helpful in the interpretation of the solvation coordinate in more complex\nsituations.\n\n10\n\n\fThe free-energy landscape model for the dynamics used in the last section to treat the\nspectral diffusion process is of a phenomenological nature and specific assumptions about\nthe dynamical evolution of the 'order parameter' \u01eb(t) and the coupling between the different\nprocesses have to be made in order to obtain a tractable model. One of the main features of\nthis model lies in the fact that there is no difference between 'relaxation rates' and 'exchange\nrates' as in typical exchange models[40]. Additionally, as mentioned above, the choice of the\n\u03ba(\u01eb|\u01eb\u2032 ) according to Eq.(15) corresponds to a minimum rate memory, Q \u2261 1[32]. This means\nthat the the lifetime of the dynamic heterogeneities is the same as the time scale of the\n\u03b1-relaxation.\nThe treatment of the spectral diffusion process in terms of coupled Langevin equations,\nEq.(16), immediately gives the result of the inhomogeneous cumulant expansion, Eq.(8),\nfor the conditional probability. Consequently, the first moment is given by Eq.(11) and\nthe time-dependent variance by Eq.(13). The reason for this behavior is given by the fact\nthat in such a Langevin equation model one starts from Gaussian fluctuations from the\noutset. Therefore, \u03c9(t) represents a non-Markovian Gaussian process. According to ref.[24]\nthis means that this model gives excellent agreement with the experimental data on QX in\nMTHF if the transition rates are chosen in such a way that the Stokes-shift correlation is\nwell parameterized by a Kohlrausch function with \u03b2K = 0.5. Therefore, the experimental\ndata are fully compatible with Q \u2261 1.\nA richer dynamical behavior of \u03c9(t) can be studied by considering the more general case\nof a ME for the composite Markov process {\u03c9(t), \u01eb(t)}. The Kramers-Moyal expansion of this\nME has led to the introduction of the parameter \u03c1 = (\u03b4 2 /2\u03c3e2 ) that measures the fluctuations\nin transition frequency relative to width of the equilibrium steady state emission spectrum.\nIt has already been mentioned in the context of Eq.(22) that the fluctuation parameter \u03c1\nplays a role very similar to the jump angle in models for the reorientational motion. 2d-NMR\nexperiments performed in the time domain allow to extract these jump angles, roughly on\nthe order of 10o in supercooled liquids[8, 9, 41]. As it is the reorientational and translational\nmotion of the solvent molecules that is responsible for the \u03c9-fluctuations, one expects that\n\u03c1 also takes on finite values. Note that such finite fluctuations cannot be treated in terms\nof Langevin equations.\nIn general, the process \u03c9(t) is neither Markovian nor Gaussian in the treatment using the\nME. Only in two limiting situations the result of the inhomogeneous cumulant expansion,\nEq.(8), is found for the conditional probability for small \u03c1. At short times the transition frequencies fluctuate in a quasi-static environment and every \u01eb \u2192 \u01eb\u2032 transition gives\nrise to Rrelaxation. Therefore, in this limit the relevant rates are just the 'escape rates'\n\u03ba(\u01eb) = d\u01eb\u2032 \u03ba(\u01eb\u2032 |\u01eb). Conversely, at long times the environmental relaxation appears to be\nfast compared to the changes in \u03c9(t). Thus, only the average rate h\u03bai is relevant for the\ntime scale of the \u03c9-fluctuations, rendering \u03c9(t) an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Note that\nthese two limits can be compared to the so-called short-time approximation and long-time\napproximation in stochastic lineshape theory[42]. Apart from these limits, \u03c9(t) is not a\nGaussian process and the deviations from Gaussian behavior have been discussed in context\nof Fig.3. Furthermore, I have discussed an inhomogeneous Gaussian approximation for the\nconditional probability which allows to smoothly interpolate between the limits of short and\nlong times, where it becomes exact. For this approximation, the result of the inhomogeneous\ncumulant expansion, Eq.(8), is recovered. In contrast, an ordinary cumulant expansion fails\nto reproduce the exact behavior at short times.\n11\n\n\fIt has been mentioned already that the expression for the P(\u03bb) (\u03c9, t|\u03c90), Eq.(8), can be\ncompared to a corresponding one given by Richert[23], if his \u03c7(t, \u03c4 ) are replaced by exp (\u2212\u03bbt).\nHowever, in ref.[23] these functions were denoted as conditional probabilities and an expression similar to Eq.(8) was postulated to hold rather than derived from a theoretical treatment.\nAdditionally, the meaning of the 'local response function' \u03c7(t, \u03c4 ) remains unclear. Unfortunately, no definition for these objects was given apart from the fact that they are related to\nthe Stokes-shift correlation function via C(t) = h\u03c7(t, \u03c4 )i which contradicts the term 'response\nfunction'. Thus, it appears that a meaningful interpretation of the \u03c7(t, \u03c4 ) can be given only\nif these functions are identified with exp (\u2212\u03bbt). Surprisingly, this apparently is not Richert's\ninterpretation because he concludes that the time-dependent variance is determined by the\n'spatially distributed local solvent responses' \u03c7(t, \u03c4 ) in case of a static heterogeneity. Additionally, in ref.[25] he considers exchange models in which the 'time constants \u03c4 of the local\nresponses' fluctuate in time. He furthermore claims that the experimental results are only\ncompatible with slow rate exchange. Of course, in an inhomogeneous cumulant expansion\nthe rates \u03bb (or corresponding time constants \u03c4 ) have to be static quantities. As I have shown\nin the last section, stochastic models which do not distinguish at all between 'relaxation' and\n'exchange' give results compatible with the available experimental data[24]. The same holds\nfor exchange models[39]. The confusion seems to have its origin in the fact that the exchange\nmodels studied in ref.[25] are not Gaussian. Therefore, a Gaussian approximation has to be\napplied to the models in order to be able to compare the results to an inhomogeneous cumulant expansion truncated at the second order. Otherwise, C(t) is not determined by the\nfirst moment and the linewidth is not given by \u03c3 2 (t). As noted above, including higher order\nterms is non-trivial, as this should also be done for the static spectra. These difficulties can\nbe avoided if one considers models which are Gaussian intrinsically, like Langevin equation\nmodels.\n\nIV. Conclusions\nIn the present paper I have derived an expression for the time-dependent optical linewidths in\nthe inhomogeneous limit for systems exhibiting slow relaxation. For this purpose, an inhomogeneous cumulant expansion has been performed, utilizing the fact that a non-exponentially\ndecaying Stokes-shift correlation function can be represented as a weighted sum of exponentially decaying functions.\nIn a free-energy landscape model developed to model the primary relaxation in supercooled liquids, the optical transition frequencies were treated as a stochastic process \u03c9(t),\nwhich is not Markovian in general. Two variants of this model have been considered, a\nLangevin approach and a treatment in terms of a master equation. In the former case the\nmodel is solved exactly by the inhomogeneous cumulant expansion as the fluctuations truly\nare Gaussian. Therefore, in this case \u03c9(t) is a non-Markovian Gaussian process. This does\nnot hold for the more general ME approach. Here, the conditional probabilities are Gaussians only in the short time and the long times limits. I have additionally considered an\ninhomogeneous Gaussian approximation that interpolates between these limits. In general,\nhowever, in such more complex models \u03c9(t) is not only non-Markovian but additionally\nnon-Gaussian.\nDue to the fact that the system is probed at two times only in the optical experiments\nunder consideration, one cannot obtain any information about the lifetime of dynamic het12\n\n\ferogeneities from these experiments alone[32]. This is in contrast to recent claims where\nit was concluded on the existence of long lived heterogeneities within a special model scenario that was assumed to apply[25]. The model calculations performed in the present paper\nclearly show that the experimental data are also fully compatible with the assumption that\nthe lifetime of the dynamic heterogeneities is on the same order as the \u03b1-relaxation time.\nAcknowledgement\nI am grateful to Hans Sillescu for illuminating discussions and his continuous encouragement\nover the years.

In the Condon approximation the latter\nis simply given by Hint = |gihe| + |eihg|. Treating the excitation pulse classically and\nthe emitted radiation quantum mechanically, the following expression for the time-resolved\nlineshape is obtained in the rotating wave approximation, see eg.[17, 18]:\nS(\u03c9S , \u03c9L , t) \u221d Re\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nd\u03c43\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nd\u03c42\n\nEL (t \u2212 t1 \u2212 t2 \u2212\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nd\u03c41 ei(\u03c9L t1 +\u03c9S t3 )\n\n\u2212\u221e\nt3 )EL\u2217 (t\n\n\u2212 t2 \u2212 t3 )R(t1 , t2 , t3 )\n\n(A.1)\n\nwhere EL (t) denotes the time-dependent amplitude of the incoming field and R(t1 , t2 , t3 ) is\na third order response function which in the inhomogeneous limit is given by[17]:\nh\n\nR(t1 , t2 , t3 ) = T r e\u2212iU t3 e\u2212iLe t2 eiU t1 \u033ag\n\ni\n\n(A.2)\n\nIn this expression, U = We \u2212Wg and \u033ag denotes the canonical ground state density operator,\n\u033ag = exp (\u2212\u03b2Hg )/T r[exp (\u2212\u03b2Hg )] with Hg = hg|H|gi and \u03b2 = (kB T )\u22121 . Furthermore, Le\ndenotes the Liouville operator corresponding to He [26].\nEq.(A.1) describes the processes visualized in the double-sided Feynman diagram[26] in\nFig.4. It is to be noted that a term corresponding to a resonant Raman process has been\nneglected completely in Eq.(A.1).\nFollowing ref.[17], in a next step it is assumed that the solvation coordinate U is the only\nrelevant quantity determing the solvent relaxation. After a projection onto the operator\nU and a second order cumulant expansion, one gets a simple expression for the response\nfunction\nR(t1 , t2 , t3 ), which\nh\ni is determined solely by the Stokes-shift correlation function\niHe t\n\u2212iHe t\nT r {e Ue\n}Ue (0)\u033ae and some static quantities. Therefore, in the inhomogeneous\nlimit the optical lineshape is completely determined by a two-time correlation function.\nIn order to perform an inhomogeneous cumulant expansion[26], it is assumed that all\nquantities depend on a configurational\nvariable \u0393 chosen from some distribution p(\u0393). One\nR\nthen calculates R(t1 , t2 , t3 ) = d\u0393p(\u0393)R(t1 , t2 , t3 ; \u0393), cf.[26], with a result analogously to that\nobtained in ref.[17]:\nR(t1 , t2 , t3 ) =\n\nZ\n\nd\u0393p(\u0393) exp (ime (\u0393)t1 ) exp (it3 [me (\u0393) + (mg (\u0393) \u2212 me (\u0393))C(t2 ; \u0393)] \u00d7\n\u00d7 exp (\u2212t23 /2[\u03c3e2 (\u0393) + (\u03c3g2 (\u0393) \u2212 \u03c3e2 (\u0393))C 2 (t2 ; \u0393)]) \u00d7\n\n(A.3)\n\n\u00d7 exp (\u2212t21 /2\u03c3g2 (\u0393) \u2212 t1 t3 \u03c3g2 (\u0393)C 2 (t2 ; \u0393))\nwhere\nm\u03b1 (\u0393) = h\u03c9(0; \u0393)i\u03b1 , \u03c3\u03b12 (\u0393) = h(\u03c9 2(0; \u0393)i\u03b1 \u2212 m2\u03b1 (\u0393)\nC(t; \u0393) = (h(\u03c9(t; \u0393)\u03c9(0; \u0393)ie \u2212 m2e (\u0393))/\u03c3e2 (\u0393)\n\n(A.4)\n\nHere, hA(t; \u0393)i\u03b1 = T r [A(t; \u0393)\u033a\u03b1 ], \u03b1 \u2208 {e, g} and\n\u03c9(t; \u0393) is the classical analogue of (\u03c9eg (\u0393) +\nR\nU(t; \u0393)). As in Eq.(A.3) one has hA(t)i\u03b1 = d\u0393p(\u0393)hA(t; \u0393)i\u03b1.\n14\n\n\fA simple expression for S(\u03c9S , \u03c9L , t) is obtained by assuming that t1 is very short and\nadditionally neglecting the optical coherence during t3 . In this case t2 can be replaced\nwith the observation time t, cf. Fig.4. Formally, these approximations amount to replace\nEL (t\u2212t1 \u2212t2 \u2212t3 )EL\u2217 (t\u2212t2 \u2212t3 ) in Eq.(A.1) by |EL |2 \u03b4(t2 \u2212t)\u03b4(t1 ).

The\nreason for the formal treatment is twofold. From the inhomogeneous cumulant expansion for\nthe response function, Eq.(A.3), it becomes clear that the 'ingredients' in Eq.(A.7) are not\nindependent. This does not become clear from Eq.(A.7) alone. If only this expression would\nbe given, there would be no reason for restricting the cumulant expansions for Sg (\u03c9 \u2032; \u0393)\nand the conditional\nprobability to the same order. Also, a generalization of the expression\nR\u221e\nI(\u03c9, t) = \u2212\u221e d\u03c90P (\u03c9, t|\u03c90)Sg (\u03c90 ), cf. ref.[20], is not straightforward in general. In particular\nit is not clear how to perform the inhomogeneous cumulant expansion. Only in the limit of\n\u0393-independent static quantities, it suffices to consider P (\u03c9, t|\u03c90).\nIn the text, only the case of \u0393-independent static quantities m\u03b1 and \u03c3\u03b1 is considered for\nsimplicity. This means that one has S\u03b1R(\u03c9) = S\u03b1 (\u03c9; \u0393) independent of \u0393. Additionally, this\n\u221e\nallows to rewrite Eq.(A.7) as I(\u03c9, t) = \u2212\u221e\nd\u03c90 P (\u03c9, t|\u03c90)Sg (\u03c90 ). In the text I choose me = 0\nand additionally rename mg = \u2206 denoting the overall red-shift.\n\nAppendix B: Kramers Moyal expansion\nIn this appendix the derivation of Eq.(18) is outlined.

This\nmeans, that \u03c9(t) is modelled as a so-called one-step process[35, 43] with a jump length \u03b4\n(\u03b4 2 = 2\u03c3e2 \u03c1, cf. Eq.(20)). Furthermore, it is assumed that spectral diffusion in the limit of\nvanishing \u03b4 can be viewed as a diffusion in a potential of the form U(\u03c9) = (4\u03b2\u03c3e2 )\u22121 \u03c9 2 with\n\u03b2 = (kB T )\u22121 .

The force originating\nfrom this potential ensures that the time-dependent distribution approaches the equilibrium\ndistribution peq (\u03c9), Eq.(9), in the long time limit. With the functions A(\u03c9) = \u2212\u03c1\u03c9 and\nB(\u03c9) = 2\u03c1\u03c3e2 the \u039b(\u03c9|\u03c9 \u2032) can be written in the from\n#\n\n\"\n\n\"\n\n#\n\nA(\u03c9) B(\u03c9)\nA(\u03c9) B(\u03c9)\n\u2032\n\u03b4(\u03c9\n\u2212\n[\u03c9\n+\n\u03b4])\n+\n\u2212\n\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2032 \u2212 [\u03c9 \u2212 \u03b4])\n+\n+\n\u039b(\u03c9|\u03c9 ) =\n2\u03b4\n2\u03b4 2\n2\u03b4\n2\u03b4 2\n\u2032\n\n(B.2)\n\nThe occurence of the inverse powers of \u03b4 has its origin in the scaling properties of the\n\u039b(\u03c9|\u03c9 \u2032)[43].

Inserting Eq.(C.2) in Eq.(23) and using Eq.(21) shows that the resulting sum over n can be\nevaluated[37].\n16\n\n\fIn the short time\nlimit, one can replace G(\u01eb\u2032 , \u03c4 |\u01eb0 ) by its initial value, G(\u01eb\u2032 , \u03c4 = 0|\u01eb0 ) =\nR\n\u03b4(\u01eb\u2032 \u2212 \u01eb0 ), yielding d\u01ebGn (\u01eb, t|\u01eb0 ) \u2243 exp [\u2212n\u03c1\u03ba(\u01eb0 )t]). Thus, one finds Eq.(8) with \u03bb = \u03c1\u03ba(\u01eb)\nand p(\u03bb) = peq (\u01eb).\nIn the long time Rlimit, on the other hand, one can write G(\u01eb\u2032 , \u03c4 = \u221e|\u01eb0 ) = peq (\u01eb\u2032 ) in\nEq.(C.2).R This gives d\u01ebGn (\u01eb, t|\u01eb0 ) \u2243 exp [\u2212n\u03c1h\u03bait], where the mean relaxation rate is defined\nas h\u03bai = d\u01eb\u03ba(\u01eb). Again, one recovers Eq.(8) with p(\u03bb) = \u03b4(\u03bb\u2212\u03c1h\u03bai).\n\nFigure captions\nFig.1 : Sketch of the evolution of the optical emission spectrum.

Here, \u03c3(\u01eb) is given in temperature units (\u03b2 = 1). Additionally, the values\nof \u01eb are restricted to the interval \u01eb \u2208 {\u2212\u03c3(\u01eb)2 , \u03c3(\u01eb)2 }, giving equilibrium probabilities\npeq (\u01eb) \u221d \u03b7(\u01eb)e\u2212\u03b2\u01eb that are truncated Gaussians. Note, that the prefactors include a\nfactor exp (\u2212\u03b2EA ) and therefore are only related in an indirect way to the attempt\nfrequencies, typically on the order of 1015 s\u22121 .\nFig.3 : (a): \u03be(t) as defined in Eq.(27) and C(2t) \u2212 C(t)2 versus scaled time for the same\nparameters as in Fig.2 for \u03b2K = 0.5.

Eq.(A.1). The solute-system initially is in thermal equilibrium in the ground state (\u033a \u221d |gihg|). The interaction with the incoming radiation,\nthe wavy lines, produces an optical coherence (|eihg|), which then is converted into an\nexcited state population (|eihe|). After photon emission, which again is accomponied\nwith a coherence, the system is again in a ground state population (|gihg|).\n\n17\n\n\fReferences\n[1] See e.g., the Proceedings of the International Discussion Meeting on Relaxation in\nComplex Systems, Vigo, Spain, 1997; published as J.
