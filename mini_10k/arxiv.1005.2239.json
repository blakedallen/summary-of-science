The sizes of\nN-body simulations are now such that, for the most part, results need no longer be statistics-limited, but are still\nsubject to various systematic uncertainties. Discrepancies in the results of simulation campaigns for the halo\nmass function remain in excess of statistical uncertainties and of roughly the same size as the error limits set\nby near-future observations; we investigate and discuss some of the reasons for these differences. Quantifying\nerror sources and compensating for them as appropriate, we carry out a high-statistics study of dark matter halos\nfrom 67 N-body simulations to investigate the mass function and its evolution for a reference \u039bCDM cosmology\nand for a set of wCDM cosmologies. For the reference \u039bCDM cosmology (close to WMAP5), we quantify the\nbreaking of universality in the form of the mass function as a function of redshift, finding an evolution of as\nmuch as 10% away from the universal form between redshifts z = 0 and z = 2.

The set of wCDM cosmologies is taken from the\nCoyote Universe simulation suite. The mass functions from this suite (which includes a \u039bCDM cosmology and\nothers with w \u2243 \u22121) are described by the fitting formula for the reference \u039bCDM case at an accuracy level of 10%,\nbut with clear systematic deviations. We argue that, as a consequence, fitting formulae based on a universal form\nfor the mass function may have limited utility in high precision cosmological applications.\nSubject headings: Cosmology: large-scale structure of universe - methods: N-body simulations\nas applied to a wide range of redshifts and objects (predictions\nof bias, early galaxies, groups, quasars, spatial statistics of luminous galaxies, etc.).\nAn important motivation for the precision determination of\nthe mass function is the existence of several ongoing and upcoming surveys that aim to detect clusters via their optical, Xray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect signatures (Rozo et al.\n2010; Abbott et al. 2005; Vikhlinin et al. 2009; Kosowsky 2003;\nStaniszewski et al. 2009; Bartlett et al. 2008; Fang & Haiman\n2008). The number of detected clusters from the individual\nsurveys will range from thousands to tens of thousands. To\nmaximally extract cosmological information from these cluster\nsurveys, the mass function must be specified to better than a\nfew percent accuracy for a range of cosmologies. As discussed\nby Cunha & Evrard (2010) and by Wu et al. (2010), the current\ntheoretical uncertainty in the determination of the mass function can lead to a considerable degradation in the constraints on\ncosmological parameters. The investigations have also pointed\nto the usefulness of determining the mass function over a wide\nrange of masses, extending down into the group scale.\nBecause massive halos are very nonlinear and dynamically\nnontrivial objects, a fully satisfactory first principles approach\nto determine the structure and statistics of halos does not yet exist. It follows, therefore, that our current theoretical understanding of the halo mass function is somewhat limited. (This situation may be contrasted to that of nonlinear perturbation theory\nfor the matter power spectrum, where independent of whether\nindividual approaches fail or succeed, the actual problem is well\ndefined conceptually and mathematically.) From the analytical\nstandpoint, the only viable approach to the mass function is still\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe current paradigm for the formation of cosmological structure is based on the gravitational amplification of primordial\ndensity fluctuations in an expanding Universe. The nonlinear\ntransformation of dark matter overdensities \u2013 via a hierarchical dynamical process \u2013 into clumpy distributions called halos,\nand the subsequent infall of baryons leading to the formation\nof stars and galaxies within these halos, rounds out the present\npicture of the formation of observed structure. Although there\nis no precise mathematical definition of a 'halo', several operational definitions \u2013 depending on the particular applications of\ninterest \u2013 have been employed in practice.\nThe spatio-temporal statistics of halos and sub-halos, as well\nas of their mass distribution (and its evolution), together provide most of the descriptive framework within which fit all of\nthe structure formation-based probes of cosmology. The mass\nfunction alone is a very useful probe in determining cosmological parameters. Because large and massive halos form very\nlate, the high-mass tail of the mass function \u2013 the regime of\ncluster-scale masses \u2013 is exponentially sensitive to dark energyrelated parameters (Haiman et al. 2001). Additionally, the redshift evolution of the cluster mass function depends strongly on\nthe cosmological parameters in a way that is complementary\nto other probes. The cluster mass function can also be used to\nmeasure the normalization of primordial density fluctuations,\n\u03c38 , and search for hints of primordial non-Gaussianity (see,\ne.g., Dalal et al. 2008; Oguri 2009). On cluster mass scales and\nsmaller, the mass function, both directly and indirectly, plays an\nimportant role in halo models of galaxy formation and statistics,\n1\n\n\f2\n\nMass Function Predictions Beyond \u039bCDM\n\nrors, in the absence of rigorous testing of the universal ansatz\nthat based on the (heuristic) Press-Schechter (PS) excursion set\nthey cannot be directly applied to cosmologies other than those\nmodel (Press & Schechter 1974; Bond et al. 1991) and its exconsidered specifically (and even in this case, the actual systensions (see Zentner 2007 for a review).

Here \u03c3 2 (M, z) is the variical overdensity (SO). In the FOF method, halos are found by a\nance of the linear density field, extrapolated by linear theory\npercolation technique where particles belong to the same halo if\nto the redshift of interest, z, and smoothed by a spherical topthey are within a certain distance (the linking length b) of each\nhat filter of radius R, which on average encloses a mass M\nother.

In Section 2 we describe\nthe simulation suite used in this paper, encompassing 67 highresolution simulations for 38 different cosmologies. Several\noverlapping-volume \u039bCDM simulations are used to understand\nand control systematic errors. These errors and their ramifications for the accuracy of the mass determination of halos, and\nhow these translate to limiting the accuracy of the mass function\nitself, are discussed in Section 3. In Section 4 we present our\nresults for the mass function for the reference \u039bCDM model at\ndifferent redshifts and provide a new fitting form for the mass\nfunction matching our simulations at the 2% level as well as\nthe associated mass function-derived halo bias. We extend our\ndiscussion in Section 5 to the wider set of wCDM cosmologies and investigate how well the mass function fit derived for\nthe reference cosmology holds for this broader class of models.\nWe conclude in Section 6. We discuss error control issues and\nprovide relevant details in Appendix A.\n2. SIMULATION SUITE\n\nOur simulation suite spans a wide range of observationally\nrelevant wCDM cosmologies, as specified in Table 1. For each\nmodel we have results from a 1.3 Gpc box simulation, run with\n10243 particles, with masses of \u2248 1010 M\u2299 , exact values depending on the specific cosmology. We vary five cosmological\nparameters within the following boundaries:\n0.120 \u2264 \u03c9m \u2264 0.155,\n0.0215 \u2264 \u03c9b \u2264 0.0235,\n0.85 \u2264 ns \u2264 1.05,\n(2)\n\u22120.130 \u2264 w \u2264 \u22120.70,\n0.61 \u2264 \u03c38 \u2264 0.90.\nThe Hubble parameter h is fixed for models 1-37 by imposing the cosmic microwave background constraint, lA = \u03c0dls /rs =\n302.4, where dls is the distance to the last scattering surface and\nrs is the sound horizon. For a detailed description of the model\nselection process, see Heitmann et al. (2009). The simulations\nare carried out with GADGET-2 (Springel 2005), a tree-particle\nmesh (tree-PM) code. For a detailed discussion and comparison of different N-body methods used for cosmological simulations, including GADGET-2, see, e.g. Heitmann et al. (2008a).\nWe use a 20483 PM grid and a (Gaussian) smoothing of 1.5\ngrid cells. The force matching is set to six times the smoothing\nscale, the tree opening criterion being set to 0.5%. The softening length is 50 kpc.\nFor model 0, the reference \u039bCDM cosmology, we have carried out additional simulations for different box sizes and multiple realizations in order to cover a wide halo mass range between 6 * 1011 M\u2299 to 3*1015 M\u2299 with good statistics. Results\nfrom the overlapping volume boxes are also useful in understanding systematic errors. Details about these \u039bCDM simulations are given in Table 2. In addition to GADGET-2 we use\na second tree-PM code for a subset of these simulations, described in White (2002). The algorithmic structure of this code\nis very similar to GADGET-2 and the code was also part of the\ncode comparison carried out in Heitmann et al. (2008a). Aside\nfrom the main simulation runs, we also use a PM simulation\nwith identical cosmological parameter settings as for the \"G\"\nrun solely to study the impact of force resolution on individual\nhalo masses.\n\n3. HALOS IN NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS\n\nAn important question to understand before proceeding further is how uncertainties in individual halo masses \u2013 defined any\nway one chooses \u2013 translate into errors in the mass function itself. To investigate this sensitivity we carry out some simple experiments. Introducing a Gaussian (or other symmetric) noise\nwith \u03c3 = 4% in individual halo mass measurements can make a\nsmall difference in the mass function at high masses (at the percent level) and should not be a concern. The picture changes\nsubstantially, however, if the halo masses are given small systematic shifts. The error induced in the mass function can become much larger than the level of systematic error introduced\nin individual halo masses. We demonstrate this effect in Figure 1, where systematic shifts in halo masses of 1%, 2%, and\n4% are studied. An increase of the masses by only 4% results in\na difference in the mass function of 15% at high masses, which\nis quite significant.\nThese results, arising from the exponential sensitivity of the\nmass function at high masses, demonstrate an important point:\nGiven the level of uncertainties in halo masses due to numerical\nerrors and the definition of the halo mass itself, it is not possible\nto derive a mass function prediction from simulations at subpercent or percent accuracy without a consistent study of how\nindividual halo masses vary as a function of simulation parameters like force resolution, time step size, starting redshift, etc.\nFortunately, it is already known that (b=0.2) FOF halo masses,\nover the mass range of interest, are relatively robust to changes\nin simulation parameters; as demonstrated in Heitmann et al.\n(2005), individual halo masses as computed by six different\ncodes with varying resolutions and time-stepping schemes typically agree to better than 2%. Additionally, Luki\u0107 et al. (2007)\nhave provided criteria for running simulations so as to minimize systematic errors from a variety of possibilities. Our task\nis to ascertain whether error control can be further improved\nsystematically.\nWe focus here on three main possible systematic errors in\n\nF IG . 1.- Sensitivity of the mass function to systematic shifts in individual\nhalo masses. Changes are shown relative to a baseline mass function, taken to\nbe the fitting form of Table 4. A small shift of 2% in the halo masses can lead\nto changes of up to 5-10% in the high mass tail of the mass function.\n\n\fBhattacharya et. al.\n\n5\n\nTABLE 2\nS PECIFICATIONS OF THE S IMULATION RUNS\n\nBox size\n\nName\n\nnp\n\nmp\n\n1000 Mpc\n1736 Mpc\n2778 Mpc\n178 Mpc\n1300 Mpc\n\nC\nB\nA\nGS\nG\n\n15003\n12003\n10243\n5123\n10243\n\n1.1 * 1010 M\u2299\n1.1 * 1011 M\u2299\n7.2 * 1011 M\u2299\n1.5 * 109 M\u2299\n7.4 * 1010 M\u2299\n\n1300 Mpc Coyote 10243\n\nvaries\n\nnmin\nh\n\u039bCDM\n400\n400\n400\n400\n400\nwCDM\n400\n\n\u01eb\n\nCode\n\nzin\n\nNruns\n\nICs\n\n24 kpc TreePM 100/75\n0\n51 kpc TreePM\n100\n0, 1\n97 kpc TreePM\n100\n0, 1\n14 kpc GADGET-2 211 0, 1, 2\n50 kpc GADGET-2 211 0, 1, 2\n\n2\n6\n10\n10\n2\n\nZA/2LPT\n2LPT\n2LPT\nZA\nZA\n\n50 kpc GADGET-2\n\n37\n\nZA\n\n211\n\nzout\n\n0, 1, 2\n\nNote. - Box size, mass and force resolution for the different runs; the upper section of the table describes the reference \u039bCDM simulation suite (model 0 in\nTable 1) while the lower section specifies the Coyote Universe runs (models 1 - 37 in Table 1). The total number of particles is denoted by n p , the particle mass by\nm p , nmin\nh the number of particles in the smallest halo kept, \u01eb the force resolution, and Nruns the number of realizations. For some simulations we used the Zel'dovich\napproximation (Zel'dovich 1970) (see also discussions in Luki\u0107 et al. 2007 and Heitmann et al. 2010) to generate the initial condtions and 2LPT (Bouchet et al.\n1995, Crocce et al. 2006) for others.\n\nthe mass function (based on experience from Heitmann et al.\n(2005) and Luki\u0107 et al. (2007)): (i) small systematic errors in\nindividual halo masses due to force resolution, focusing attention on the high mass tail, (ii) the known systematic bias in individual FOF masses as a function of the number of particles in\nthe FOF halo (Warren et al. 2006), and (iii) systematic errors\nfrom missing long wavelength power due to the necessarily finite box size. We also note the easily avoidable pitfall of using\napproximate fits for the transfer function rather than the numerical solution (see Appendix A for details). As discussed below,\nand in more detail in Appendix A, all of these effects can induce\nsystematic errors in the mass function and need to be taken into\naccount. (Figure 2 shows the effect of various corrections.)\nAll numerical simulations are necessarily run with a finite\nforce resolution, balancing the need for high spatial resolution with suppression of noise/collisional artifacts. Below the\nchosen force softening length, the forces between the particles\nasymptote to zero. As a result, the halos that are formed tend\nto be \"puffed out\" in a simulation with coarse force resolution.\nThe net effect is that \u2013 for heavy halos, with scale radii significantly greater than the softening length \u2013 the mass of a given\nhalo in a simulation with coarse resolution tends to be greater\ncompared to a simulation with better resolution. This implies\nthat the halo mass and hence the mass function determined from\na simulation study would be higher compared to the \"ideal\"\ncase of infinite force (and mass) resolution. Although this effect is known to be small (Luki\u0107 et al. 2007), it can certainly be\nsignificant at the percent level of error in the mass function. We\nalso note that the effect of force resolution depends on the details of how halos are found using the SO and FOF algorithms.\nHere we focus on the case of FOF halos; a discussion of the\nimpact of force resolution on SO halos is given in Tinker et al.\n(2008). In Appendix A we provide a detailed analysis of the errors due to finite force resolution and how to correct for them.\nIn our simulations, we find that finite force resolution effects\ncan be accounted for by introducing a corrected rescaled mass\nMc via\nMc /M = 1.0 \u2212 0.04(\u01eb/650 kpc).\n(3)\nHere M is the uncorrected halo mass and \u01eb is the force resolution measured in kpc of the different runs as specified in Table 2. In our case, the biggest correction applied is \u2248 0.6% for\nindividual halo masses for the A runs (with a force resolution of\n\n97 kpc). This results in a systematic lowering of approximately\n2% in the high-mass tail of the mass function (primarily run A)\nas shown in Figure A16 in the Appendix.\nAs stated earlier, we identify halos with a standard FOF algorithm, with a linking length, b = 0.2. Although halos with only\na small number of particles (\u223c 20) can be reliably found with\nthe FOF algorithm, accurate mass estimation requires keeping\nmany more particles within individual halos. Aside from simple considerations of particle shot noise, there is an inherent\nsystematic error and scatter in the definition of an FOF halo\nmass with particle number, even in the absence of all other limitations, as pointed out by Warren et al. (2006). For ideal NFW\nhalos (and for isolated relaxed halos in simulations), this effect\nwas studied by Luki\u0107 et al. (2009) and represents the best possible scenario. To avoid problems with too few particles in halos,\nwe restrict attention to halos with at least 400 particles. With\nthis cutoff, the agreement in the mass function for the overlap regions across the various boxes is within a few percent.\nAfter first applying the FOF sampling correction suggested by\nWarren et al. (2006), we find that a slightly modified correc\u22120.65\ntion of the form ncorr\n) brings the results from the\nh = nh (1 \u2212 nh\nnested boxes in good agreement, as shown in the Appendix in\nFigure A17. We stress that this adjustment is purely empirical, targeted at matching halo masses in overlapping boxes.\nThe study in Luki\u0107 et al. (2009) shows that for NFW halos, the\ncorrection depends on nh as well as on the halo concentration.\nThus, in principle, one may expect the FOF sampling correction\nto be more complex than a simple compensation based on nh ;\nwe leave a more detailed analysis for future work. The use of\nthe restriction nh \u2265 400 appears, however, to make the correction predominantly dependent on nh alone. The net correction\nin halo mass due to finite force and mass resolution, for our\nsimulation suite, can then be written as\nMc /M = [1.0 \u2212 0.04(\u01eb/650 kpc)](1 \u2212 nh\u22120.65).\n(4)\nLast, we consider systematic errors due to the finite volume\nof simulations. There are three sorts of effects of this type.\nThe first is simply that the number of halos at high masses will\nbe poorly sampled, and the mass function in this region will\nhave large statistical error bars due to shot noise (Poisson fluctuations). This is purely a question of having sufficient total\nsimulation volume. The second effect is the fact that missing\nlarge-scale modes, with k < 2\u03c0/L (L is the box size in lin-\n\n\f6\n\nMass Function Predictions Beyond \u039bCDM\n\nF IG . 2.- Uncorrected (upper panel) and corrected (lower panel) results for the ratio of the mass function to our best fit model at z = 0. Most of the difference is\ndue to the correction for the finite particle sampling of the halos. A detailed description of the error bars is given in the appendix.\n\near dimension), lead to a suppression of structure formation,\nand hence of the mass function, as reduced power is available\nfor transfer from linear to nonlinear scales as evolution proceeds. Mass functions measured from simulations must therefore account for the infrared cutoff in the variance of matter\nfluctuations \u03c3(M). The extended Press-Schechter approach has\nbeen found to work well in compensating for this effect (see\nLuki\u0107 et al. 2007 and references therein), and we follow it here.\nFor our simulations, this volume correction is relevant only for\nthe small box (GS) set of simulations, where L = 178 Mpc, and\naffects only the low mass halos. Applying the EPS method to\nthe smallest box shifts the masses by 2%.\nThe third finite volume effect is related to the (effective) number of independent realizations, i.e., the sample variance. Because halos are biased tracers of the density field, the mass function in a given, sufficiently large, target volume is sensitive to\nthe local mean density as set by the scale-independent bias. In\na large-volume simulation, local sub-volumes will have fluctuating average densities and these will add another component\nto the mass function variance, aside from shot noise. There\nare two ways to address this: (i) because of the high covariance between the small number of low k modes in a simulation\nand its high k modes, run either very large boxes where the\n\nrelevant low k modes (in terms of power transfer) are sampled\nsufficiently well, or (ii) run a sufficient number of statistically\nindependent large-volume boxes.\nIn either case, one can successfully estimate the variance using a simple halo model prescription and linear theory for density fluctuations (Hu & Kravtsov 2003); details are given in\nAppendix A.3. An important point to note is that all simulation\nboxes necessarily have a definite infrared cutoff set by the box\nsize. This can in fact be tuned to control the mass function variance: smaller boxes have smaller variance because they have\nless low-frequency power. Of course, one cannot make the box\ntoo small because then the mass function will be biased low as\nin the EPS discussion above.\nIf one runs only one box, then resampling techniques such\nas the jackknife may have to be used to estimate the associated errors (see, e.g., Tinker et al. 2008; Crocce et al. 2010).\nThese techniques can be susceptible to misestimation of errors\nfor smaller boxes, due to the assumed independence of subvolumes of the simulation box. To estimate our errors, we prefer\nto use independent realizations for a given simulation volume.\nThis has the advantage that the individual modes of fluctuations\nare truly independent across realizations and hence averaging\nover them represents the true variance for each set of runs. We\n\n\fBhattacharya et. al.\nnote that for large boxes \u223c2 Gpc, jacknife sampling works well\n(Tinker et al. 2008). However, since we have 10 independent\n2 Gpc box runs (A), we can use the different realizations to estimate the errors. (Additionally, the increased mass resolution\nin each box makes one less susceptible to the finite sampling\nproblem in determining FOF halo masses.) The sample variance errors were computed by taking the ratio of the variance\nfor each of the runs divided by the number of realizations of\neach run; details are discussed in Appendix A.3. As stated already, with this method one also has the extra flexibility of tuning the low frequency cut-off to optimize the mass variance (if\nthe only simulation goal is to produce an accurate mass function).\nOur results from this section are summarized in Figure 2.\nThe upper panel shows the raw simulation results and the lower\npanel includes our three corrections for force resolution, finite\nsampling, and finite volume. In order to show the effects more\nclearly, we display the ratio of the mass function to our best\nfit to the data, as derived in the next section. Once the simulation parameters for initial redshift, force resolution, and box\nsize are chosen in a suitable way for studying the mass function, the major correction required is the one due to finite mass\nresolution.\n4. REFERENCE \u039b CDM MODEL\n\n4.1. Mass Function at the Present Epoch\nAfter having analyzed possible systematic errors and corrected for them in all our simulations, we now investigate the\nmass function for the reference \u039bCDM cosmology specified in\nTable 1 (model 0) at z = 0. The effective simulation volume,\ncombining all of our runs, is approximately 250 Gpc3 . The\nsimulations provide coverage of halo masses ranging from that\nrelevant for individual bright galaxies all the way to clusters,\nwith good statistics. Although the total volume is dominated by\nthe set of runs with box size of 2778 Mpc, the other runs are\nvery helpful in checking for and investigating systematic errors\nas seen above, and in extending the simulation reach to lower\nhalo masses.\nAs previously discussed, a convenient form to express the\nscaled differential mass function f (\u03c3, z) is (Jenkins et al. 2001):\nd\u03c1/\u03c1b\ndn(M, z)\nM\nf (\u03c3, z) =\n=\n.\n(5)\nd ln \u03c3 \u22121 \u03c1b (z) d ln[\u03c3 \u22121 (M, z)]\nHere n(M, z) is the number density of halos with mass M, \u03c1b (z)\nis the background density at redshift z, and \u03c3(M, z) is the variance of the linear matter power spectrum P(k) over a length R,\nZ\nD2 (z) \u221e 2\n\u03c3 2 (M, z) \u2261\nk P(k)W 2 (kR(M))dk,\n(6)\n2\u03c0 2 0\nwhen smoothed on the scale R(M) = (3M/4\u03c0\u03c1b )1/3 with the tophat filter W (x) = 3[sin(x) \u2212 x cos(x)]/x3 . We write \u03c3(M) \u2261 \u03c3 for\nbrevity in the following. The redshift dependence is encapsulated in the growth factor D(z) which is normalized in such a\nway that D(0) = 1. As mentioned earlier, the advantage of this\ndefinition of the mass function is that to a reasonable accuracy\nit does not explicitly depend on redshift, power spectrum, or\ncosmology; all of these are encapsulated in \u03c3(M, z).\nA popular numerical fit for the differential mass function\nf (\u03c3) is given in Sheth & Tormen (1999) (ST hereafter). The\nexpression for the ST mass function is\nr\n\u0015 \u0014 \u0012 2 \u0013p\u0015\n\u0014\n2a\n\u03c3\n\u03b4c\na\u03b4 2\nfST (\u03c3) = A\nexp \u2212 c2 1 +\n,\n(7)\n2\n\u03c0\n2\u03c3\na\u03b4c\n\u03c3\n\n7\n\nwhere A, a, and p are three parameters tuned to simulation results with a = 0.707 (a = 0.75 is proposed as a better estimate in\nSheth & Tormen 2002 ), p = 0.3, and A = 0.3222. The parameter A is fixed by the normalization condition that all dark matter\nparticles reside in halos, i.e.\nZ \u221e\nd ln \u03c3 f (\u03c3) = 1.\n(8)\n0\n\nWe note that, as a practical matter, the lower halo mass cut-off\nin numerical simulations is too large to test this particular assumption. So, in principle, one could leave this constant as a\nfree variable in the fitting process. With the normalization condition fullfilled, the ST mass function has two free parameters,\na and p. \u03b4c is the density threshold for spherical collapse. In an\nEinstein-de Sitter cosmology, \u03b4c = 1.686, independent of redshift. For \u03a9m 6= 1, the value for \u03b4c shows insignificant dependence on cosmology (Lacey & Cole 1993). We checked that\nincluding the cosmology dependence in \u03b4c does not explain the\nredshift evolution of f (\u03c3) seen in our simulations. In the following, we therefore keep \u03b4c = 1.686 as a fixed value.\nIn order to obtain a fit for f (\u03c3, z), we need to compare Equation (5) with the binned mass function obtained from the simulations. We measure the number density of halos in a bin of\nsize \u2206 ln M with mass limits [M1 , M2 ], as\nZ\n1 d ln \u03c3\nnbin = \u03c1b\nfdata (M, z)d ln M,\n(9)\n\u2206 ln M M d ln M\nIn the limit that \u2206 ln M \u2192 0, we can write Equation (9) as\n1 d ln \u03c3(Mbin , z)\nfdata (Mbin , z)\u2206 ln Mbin ,\nnbin = \u03c1b\nMbin d ln Mbin\nand hence fdata (Mbin , z) can be written as\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\nnbin Mbin\nd ln \u03c3(Mbin , z)\nfdata (Mbin , z) =\n,\n(10)\n\u03c1b \u2206 ln Mbin\nd ln Mbin\n\nF IG . 3.- Ratio of the mass function data at z = 0 with respect to our z = 0 fit\nfor different choices of the number of bins.

The binned numerical data are the\npoints with error bars; the ratios are taken with respect to the analytic fit to the\nnumerical data specified by Equation (12). Because the fits are based on runs\nwith different cosmologies, exact correspondence cannot be expected (since\nthe mass function is not universal).\n\nP\nwhere Mbin = Mi /Nbin , and the summation is over all the halos in a bin. When combining all the boxes from the various\nsimulations, we vary \u2206 ln M and make it small enough to ensure that Equation (10) holds within the accuracy of the data.\nThe results are shown in Figure 3. We find that four bins per\ndecade equally divided in ln-space between 1011 \u2212 1014 M\u2299 and\n15 bins per decade between 1014 \u2212 3 * 1015 M\u2299 are sufficient\nfor the mass function to converge within the measurement errors for z = 0 and z = 1. This corresponds to a bin size of\n\u2206 ln M = 0.25 between 1011 \u2212 1014 M\u2299 and \u2206 ln M = 0.06 between 1014 \u2212 1016 M\u2299 . For z = 2, four bins per decade in mass\n(\u2206 ln M = 0.25) are sufficient for the measurements to converge\nwithin the accuracy of the data.\nFigure 4 compares different mass function expressions given\npreviously as compared to our new simulation results at z = 0.\nThe expressions for different fits are given in Table 3. Some\nof these expressions, derived from earlier simulations, are significantly discrepant \u2013 especially at high masses \u2013 at the 20%\nlevel and higher. Results from more recent simulations are in\nmuch better agreement, partly because the cosmologies run are\nmuch closer. We note that exact correspondence cannot be expected because the mass function is not universal; we defer a\ndiscussion of this point to Section 5.\nIn order to obtain a fitting form to our results, we begin with\nthe ST fit as the starting point, although, as shown in Figure 4,\nthe ST mass function deviates from the simulation results by as\nmuch as 40% at the high mass end. As a first step to improve the\naccuracy of the ST mass function, we drop the normalization\nrequirement and refit all three parameters A, a, and p to the\nnumerical data. With this approach, the simulation data can\nbe fit to an accuracy of 10-15%, significantly worse than the\nstatistical errors of our data set (see also Manera et al. 2010).\n\n0.333\n,\n(1+z)0.11\n\n\u00e3 =\n\n0.788\n,\n(1+z)0.01\n\np\u0303 =\n\n0.807\n,\n(1+z)0.0\n\nq\u0303 =\n\n1.795\n(1+z)0.0\n\nThe remaining inadequacy of the ST fit can be addressed in\ndifferent ways. For example, Warren et al. (2006) introduced\na fourth parameter into the ST functional form and refitted the\nother three parameters to their simulation data, finding a best fit\nmass function:\n\u0012\n\u0015\n\u0013\n\u0014\n1\nd\nfW (\u03c3) = AW\n(11)\n+ c exp \u2212 2 ,\n\u03c3b\n\u03c3\nwith AW = 0.7234, b = 1.625, c = 0.2538, and d = 1.1982. As\nshown in Figure 4, this particular fit also severely underestimates the mass function at high masses, by up to \u223c 30%. While\nadequate as a fitting form over a finite range, Equation (11)\ndiverges when the normalization condition is imposed [Equation (8)]. To avoid this, we present a new fitting function for\nf (\u03c3). This is the simplest ST modification that does not diverge\nbut adds one extra parameter, q\u03030 (for q\u03030 = 1 we recover the ST\nmass function):\nr\n\u221a !q\u03030\n\u0015 \" \u0012 2 \u0013 p\u03030 #\n\u0014\n\u03b4c \u00e3\n\u03c3\n\u00e30 \u03b4c2\n2\nmod\nf (\u03c3, z = 0) = \u00c30\n.\n1+\nexp \u2212 2\n\u03c0\n2\u03c3\n\u00e30 \u03b4c2\n\u03c3\n(12)\nWe use a \u03c72 technique to determine the best fit f (\u03c3) that matches\nthe mass function data obtained by combining all of the \u039bCDM\nruns. That is, we minimize\nN\nX\nf (\u03c3)mod \u2212 f (\u03c3)data\n\u03c72 =\n,\n(13)\n(\u2206 f (\u03c3)data )2\ni=1\n\nwhere f (\u03c3)mod , f (\u03c3)data and \u2206 f (\u03c3)data are given by Equations (12),\n(10), and (A4) respectively.\nMinimizing \u03c72 gives the best fit parameter values: \u00c30 = 0.333,\n\u00e30 = 0.788, p\u03030 = 0.807, and q\u03030 = 1.795 with a \u03c72 per degree of\nfreedom of 1.15. The subscript \"0\" indicates that the best fit\nvalues are specified at z = 0. The results are summarized in\nTable 4. As mentioned above, this expression does not diverge\nwhen the normalization condition is imposed, however, the best\nfit does not lead to a normalization of unity. As shown in Figure 5, this modified expression agrees with the simulation data\nto better than 2% accuracy at z = 0. As further discussed in Section 4.2 a simple redshift dependence has to be introduced into\nthe fitting function to obtain agreement at the same accuracy\nlevel at higher redshifts.\n4.2. Redshift Evolution and Universality\n\nThe z = 0 mass function fit of Section 4.1 has a default universal form. However, as remarked previously, it is known that the\nmass function deviates from universality \u2013 as a function of redshift \u2013 for \u039bCDM cosmologies.

As shown in\nFigure 5, this deviation can be as much as 10% between redshifts z = 0 \u2212 2 for FOF halos, in agreement with the results of\nCrocce et al. (2010). In this section we extend our fitting function to include the redshift evolution of the mass function. We\nparameterize the possible redshift evolution of each parameter\nvia a simple power-law form\n\u00c3 = \u00c30 /(1 + z)\u03b11 ,\n\u00e3 = \u00e30 /(1 + z)\u03b12 ,\np\u0303 = p\u03030 /(1 + z)\u03b13 ,\n(14)\nq\u0303 = q\u03030 /(1 + z)\u03b14 .\nIn order to ensure that the expression for the redshift evolution\nreproduces the mass function at any intermediate redshift when\ninterpolated or even extrapolated, we fit two redshift outputs at\na time. Thus we have three values for each parameter. The final set of parameters is the average of the three values obtained\nusing redshift outputs in pairs. Figure 5 shows that the power\nlaw model of Equations (14) is able to capture the redshift evolution with an accuracy of better than 3% within the range of\n0.6 \u2264 1/\u03c3 \u2264 2.4. We find that only two of the four parameters of Equations (14) show any redshift evolution. The best\nfit values for the parameters \u03b1i describing the redshift evolution are \u03b11 = 0.11, \u03b12 = 0.01, \u03b13 = 0.0, and \u03b14 = 0.0. We note\nthat the non-universal redshift evolution is suppressed at higher\nredshifts as the effect of the cosmological constant is reduced\nand matter-domination takes over. To recap, our analytic bestfit to the mass function data uses one extra shape parameter\ncompared to ST to match the z = 0 data, and then introduces\na simple z-dependence (two more parameters) to capture nonuniversal behavior.\nWe also explore the option of allowing for a redshift dependence, \u03b4c (z), as determined by the spherical collapse model.\n\n2\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22120.75)\nand G2 (\u03c3) = exp \u2212 (ln \u03c32(0.2)\n2\n\n2\n\nFor the \u039bCDM cosmology adopted here, the spherical collapse\ncalculation yields \u03b4c = 1.674, 1.684, and 1.686 respectively for\nz = 0, 1, and 2. As expected, at z = 2, \u03b4c approaches the value\nexpected for the \u03a9m = 1 cosmology. Allowing for this redshift\ndependence does not mitigate the redshift dependence of the\nother fitting parameters; including \u03b4c (z) changes the value of\n\u00e3 to 0.799/(1 + z)0.024 (in fact increasing the redshift dependence) while the other parameters remain unchanged. Therefore, adding \u03b4c (z) does not help explain the z-dependence seen\nin our simulations, and we do not include it in our fit.\nHigh-statistics studies of the evolution of the FOF mass function have been carried out previously. In an investigation focusing mainly at high redshifts, to explain the violation of universality, Reed et al. (2007) proposed an effective spectral slope\nneff set by the halo radius, parameterized as\nd ln\u03c3 \u22121\nneff = 6\n\u2212 3.\n(15)\nd ln M\nThis new effective slope induces a redshift dependence in the\nmass function. However, as shown in Figure 6, the analytic fit\nof Reed et al. (2007) is not in good agreement with our results\n(see also Bagla et al. (2009) which studies the dependence of\nthe mass function universality on the initial matter power spectrum). This discrepancy indicates that high redshift evolution\nof the mass function is slower compared to that at lower redshifts. Crocce et al. (2010) also use a simple power-law form\nto fit for redshift evolution. Our reference model and the parameters of Crocce et al. (2010) are very close, consequently,\ntheir results are significantly closer to ours, except at very high\nmasses, where their fit appears to deviate. Here, discrepancies\nmay result from the use of an approximate transfer function 1\nand a small systematic offset in their fitting procedure at high\nmasses (Cf. their Figure 8). Taking this offset into account\n1\n\nM.

Mass function-derived large-scale halo bias\nThe evolution of the spatial distribution of halos has been\nstudied in detail in Cole & Kaiser (1989) and subsequently in\nMo & White (1996) and Sheth & Tormen (1999).

(2007)\nunderestimate the amount of evolution indicating that high redshift evolution\nof the mass function is slower compared to that at lower redshift. The agreement with Crocce et al. (2010) is better (at the 4-5% level), except for the\nrunaway at high masses (see discussion in Section 4.2).\n\nderlying dark matter distribution. The halo bias in general is\nstochastic and a nonlinear function of the underlying density\nfield (Schulz & White 2006; Seljak & Warren 2004). In addition, it also depends on the assembly history of the halos\n(Dalal et al. 2008). As discussed in Sheth & Tormen (1999),\nwithin the halo model, the large scale deterministic bias can\nbe derived knowing the shape and evolution of the mass function. It is known that the peak\u2013background split model prediction for the bias using the Sheth-Tormen or Warren et al.\n(2006) mass function is in disagreement with direct numerical calculations of this quantity obtained from ratios of correlation functions or power spectra in simulations (see, e.g., Luki\u0107\n\n\fBhattacharya et. al.\n\n11\n\nNote that this difference is maximal for halos in the mass range\n1013 \u2212 1014 M\u2299 . Unfortunately, the fact that the (nominally)\nimproved prediction for the bias lies consistently below the ST\nprediction, makes it deviate even further from numerical calculations for the large-scale bias as a function of mass. This behavior is in excellent accord with the analysis in Luki\u0107 (2008)\nperformed using the Warren et al. (2006) mass function fit and\nsimulation data from Luki\u0107 et al. (2007). Therefore, we conclude that the simple halo model result for the halo bias does\nnot converge correctly as one essential ingredient \u2013 the mass\nfunction accuracy \u2013 is systematically improved. Our conclusion is consistent with other recent studies: Tinker et al. (2010)\nhave found that SO halos are systematically biased 10% higher\ncompared to the Sheth-Tormen bias prediction. Manera et al.\n(2010) also conclude that a prediction based on a simple peakbackground ansatz is inadequate to find agreement with their\nsimulation results.\n5.

Given\na more accurate mass function, it is easy to check if the halo\nmodel approach now produces a better answer for the halo bias.\nTo test this \u2013 following Sheth & Tormen (1999) and Cole & Kaiser\n(1989) \u2013 we now obtain the expression for the large scale bias\nusing our expression for the mass function.\nThe expression for bias can be written in terms of the conditional and unconditional mass functions as\nN(m, z1 |M,V, z0 )\nbh =\n\u22121\nn(m, z1 )V\n\u03bd10 f (\u03bd10 )\n=\n\u2212 1,\n(16)\n\u03bd1 f (\u03bd1 )\nwhere N(m, z1 |M,V, z0 ) is the average number of halos of mass\nm which collapsed at z1 and in a cell of volume V which contains the mass M at z0 and \u03bd = \u03b4c2 /\u03c3 2 .\nIn the large scale limit, the 'peak-background split' formalism (Sheth & Tormen 1999; Cole & Kaiser 1989) prediction for\nthe halo bias for mass m at redshift z can be derived as follows: Define the peak height \u03bd1 relative to the background \u03bd0\n2\nas \u03bd10\n= (\u03b41 \u2212 \u03b40 )2 /(\u03c312 \u2212 \u03c302 ). Keeping the leading order terms in\n2\nthe expression gives \u03bd10\n= \u03bd12 (1 \u2212 2\u03b40 /\u03b41 ). One can then Taylor\nexpand Equation (16) and use Equation (7) to obtain the bias\npredicted by the ST mass function in Lagrangian space. Converting to bias in Eulerian space, the result is\n2p/\u03b4c\na\u03bd \u2212 1\n+\n.\n(17)\nbST = 1 +\n\u03b4c\n1 + (a\u03bd) p\nSimilarly, using the mass function fit based on our simulation\nresults, Equation (12), the large scale bias can be expressed as\n\u00e3\u03bd \u2212 q\u0303\n2 p\u0303/\u03b4c\nbmod = 1 +\n+\n.\n(18)\n\u03b4c\n1 + (\u00e3\u03bd) p\u0303\nFigure 9 shows the predicted bias compared to the ST result.\nDue to the difference in the two mass function fits, we find\na corresponding change in the large scale bias of 10 \u2212 15%.\n\nBased on our results in Section 4, which include a mass function fit at 2% accuracy for the reference \u039bCDM cosmology, we\nnow investigate how well this fit works as cosmological parameters are varied. Including the dark energy equation of state parameter, w, as a phenomenological constant, we consider a suite\nof wCDM models: 37 simulations that span a wide range of cosmological parameter values. The values of the parameters for\neach simulation are given in Table 1 with the ranges being specified in Equation (2). Although each simulation is individually\nlarge, the volume of each run is much smaller (2.2 Gpc3 ) than\nfor the combined reference \u039bCDM runs (250 Gpc3 ). Therefore,\nthe statistics of the halos, especially at high masses, is not as\nwell-determined in this case. Consequently, we do not attempt\n\nF IG . 9.- Large scale halo bias from the peak-background split formalism,\nderived from the mass function.

The lines show the ratio of the fit if \u03b4c is\ncosmology dependent in the \u039bCDM fit.\n\nan as careful statistical fit for the mass function for the wCDM\nmodels, although we do use all the relevant error controls. For\neach run we compute the Poisson error and the sample variance\nerror using Equation A5.\nInterestingly, it turns out that the modified universal fit already derived for the \u039bCDM case, including the redshift evolution, also works in a relatively unbiased way for the suite of\nwCDM cosmologies at the 5 \u2212 10% level. However, clear systematic violations of universality are observed from this suite\nof runs as cosmological parameters are varied (Figures 10, 11\nand 12). The figures show the ratio of the wCDM mass functions at z = 0, 1, and 2 obtained from our simulation suite with\nrespect to the reference \u039bCDM mass function. We find that\nthe FOF mass function shows systematic \u223c5-10% variations (in\nboth directions) with respect to the \u039bCDM reference (at higher\nmasses, the statistics is not good enough to make very precise\nstatements), although universality is preserved at the 2 \u2212 3%\nlevel upto 1/\u03c3 \u223c 1.2. Note that for some choices of cosmological parameters the difference is as large as 10% especially\nat the high mass end at z = 0.\nWe also investigate the cosmology dependence of \u03b4c as predicted by spherical collapse. Details of the calculation of \u03b4c as\na function of cosmology are given in Appendix B. (See also\n\nPace et al. 2010 for a detailed study.) The lines in Figures 10,\n11, and 12 represent the ratio of our fit at a particular redshift\nwhen \u03b4cwCDM is used in our expression in Table 4 to the reference \u039bCDM fit at that redshift. Adding \u03b4cwCDM agrees qualitatively with the wCDM runs, however the difference predicted\nby the spherical collapse model is too small to be in quantitative agreement with our results. Note that \u03b4cwCDM depends only\non two parameters for a flat wCDM cosmology, namely \u03a9m and\nw. However, universality can also break down as other parameters change, and some of these \u2013 \u03c38 , h, and ns , \u2013 are also varied\nhere. There is currently no theoretical framework to understand\nthe breaking of universality with these parameters. At higher\nredshift, wCDM cosmologies are expected to converge to the\n\u03a9m =1 cosmology. This is roughly the trend seen in Fig. 11 and\n12 for the case of z = 1 and z = 2.\nFigure 13 summarizes our findings in this section showing\nthe best fit mass function f (\u03c3) at three redshifts and the simulation results from the 37 cosmologies. Overall, all cosmologies\nare described reasonably well by our new fit. Points to be noted\ninclude: (i) An approximately universal fit describes the wCDM\nmass function at 10% accuracy over an observationally useful\nrange of cosmological parameters, and (ii) universality of the\nmass function is systematically broken at this level of accuracy\n\n\fBhattacharya et. al.\n\n13\n\nF IG . 11.- Ratio of the mass function for wCDM cosmologies to the best fit mass function for the \u039bCDM case at z=1.

To extend our work further would require a series of large simulations with their mass function results interpolated along the same lines as already achieved for the power\nspectrum to scales of order k \u223c 1 hMpc\u22121 (Lawrence et al. 2010).\n6. DISCUSSION\n\nIn this work, we study the mass function of dark matter halos\nover a wide range of masses (6 * 1011 \u2212 3 * 1015 M\u2299 for a reference \u039bCDM model) and a redshift range of z = 0 \u2212 2 for a large\nrange of wCDM cosmologies. A friends-of-friends algorithm\nwith a linking length of b = 0.2 is used for halo identification.\nThe primary aims are to control numerical errors and gain sufficient statistical power for cosmological parameter estimation\nand testing of the universality of the mass function. For a reference \u039bCDM model, we achieve a 2% error in determining the\nmass function. At this level of numerical control, deviations\nfrom universality (in both cosmological parameters and redshift\nevolution) can be studied systematically. Our level of numeri-\n\ncal control is approaching the N-body baseline level \u2013 necessary but by no means sufficient \u2013 required by next-generation\ncosmological surveys. The quest for high accuracy in the 'Nbody' mass function has a natural stopping point at the percent\nlevel simply because at this point many other physical processes\nbecome important (e.g., baryonic effects, Stanek et al. 2009).\nMoreover, the connections to observations need to be directly\nmodeled and end up adding their own significant contribution\nto the overall error.\nWe use a large number of high resolution simulations for\nstudying the mass function in a single \u039bCDM cosmology. These\nsimulations are used to establish the error control methodology\nin order to obtain an accurate mass function. Error sources systematically studied here include effects of finite force resolution, FOF particle sampling bias, and systematics induced by\nfinite-volume effects.\nUsing the more accurate mass function fit for this reference\ncosmology, we also rederive the large scale halo bias using the\n'peak-backgound split' approach. Compared to previous results obtained with the ST fit, the halo bias changes by 10-15%\nbetween z = 0 \u2212 2, and is systematically lower. Unfortunately,\ninstead of improving the agreement with direct numerical measurements of halo bias (computed by taking ratios of correlation\nfunctions), the use of an improved mass function only increases\n\n\f14\n\nMass Function Predictions Beyond \u039bCDM\n\nF IG . 12.- Ratio of the mass function for wCDM cosmologies to the best fit mass function for the \u039bCDM case at z=2. The lines show the ratio of the fit if \u03b4c is\ncosmology dependent in the \u039bCDM fit.\n\nthe discrepancy. This points to an essential difficulty with the\nhalo modeling approach. We will return to this problem elsewhere (Luki\u0107 et al. 2010).\nAfter studying the mass function in detail for the reference\n\u039bCDM cosmology, we extend the range of cosmological parameters by considering a suite of wCDM simulations. The\nrange of parameters is set by the current constraints on cosmological parameters. The simulation parameters for the runs are\ngiven in Tables 1 and 2. We note that the reference mass function fit provides a good description of the wCDM results at an\naccuracy of \u223c 10%, however, with systematic deviations that\npoint to clear violations of the universality of the mass function, not only in wCDM parameter space, but also within the\nset of \u039bCDM models (and models very close to \u039bCDM).\nThe breaking of universality as a function of different \u039bCDM\nparameters is studied in Jenkins et al. (2001); Tinker et al. (2008);\nWarren et al. (2006). These studies have shown that universality breaks down at the 20% level when \u03c38 and \u03a9m are varied.\nAlso Courtin et al. (2010) have studied how universality breaks\ndown for quintessence cosmology and found similar variation\nof universality with cosmology as reported here. The universality of the mass function in the presence of early dark energy\nhas been studied in Grossi & Springel (2009). We find that universality in the mass function holds at the 10% level as a func-\n\ntion of cosmological parameters (the wCDM suite) and redshift\n(wCDM and the reference \u039bCDM model).\nGiven the breaking of universality discussed here (see also\nTinker et al. 2008), it is not clear what the utility of fitting formulae for the mass function might be for observations that actually do require theoretical predictions at the percent level of accuracy. An extensive future simulation campaign will be needed\nto properly come to grips with this problem. Nevertheless, to\nprovide a compact description of our results, we derive a fitting formula that agrees with our reference \u039bCDM simulation\nresults at 2% accuracy over the redshift range of z = 0 \u2212 2 and\nthe mass range of 6 * 1011 \u2212 3 * 1015 M\u2299 . The fitting function is\na simple modification of the Sheth-Tormen form with one extra\nshape parameter to improve the fit at z = 0 and two extra evolution parameters. This form does not lead to divergences if the\nnormalization condition that all mass resides in dark matter halos is imposed. It holds at the 10% level of accuracy for a broad\nclass of wCDM cosmologies with the redshift evolution taken\ninto account.\nA special acknowledgment is due to supercomputing time\nawarded to us under the LANL Institutional Computing initiative.

Usually computed via Boltzmann codes such as CMBFAST (Seljak & Zaldarriaga 1996)\nor the related code CAMB2 , the transfer function is in principle known to 0.1% accuracy (Seljak et al. 2003), quite sufficient for the task at hand. Due to their simplicity, however,\nanalytic fits have sometimes been used. As an example, the forF IG . A14.- Ratio of halo abundances using the fitting formula given\nmula given in Eisenstein & Hu (1999) agrees with numerical\nin Table 3 for two different transfer functions- the analytic fitting form\nresults to better than 5% (around a central region of parameof Eisenstein & Hu (1999) and that generated using CAMB. The ratio of the\nter space). However, using such a fit (as for example, in the\nmass function for two different transfer function choices is shown. At the high\nmass end, the mass function is overestimated by several percent if the analytic\nwork of Crocce et al. 2010) gives two errors: (i) an incorrect\nfit is used.\nmapping from \u03c3(M) to M (Figure A14, where using the wrong\ntransfer function yields a noticeable overprediction of the halo\nabundance at high masses), and (ii) a systematic error in the un(PM) code with a 20483 spatial grid, corresponding to a force\nderlying simulation which no longer accurately represents the\nresolution\nof approximately 700 kpc. We call the two runs G\ncorrect cosmology. It is therefore important to use the most\nand\nPM\nrespectively.\naccurate transfer function available to obtain precision results\nSince the runs have identical initial conditions, halos in both\nfrom simulations.\nruns should have approximately the same locations.

One of the simulations\nof particles required for a halo to form is \u2248 400 (see Equais run using GADGET-2 with a force resolution of 50 kpc as\ntion 30 in Luki\u0107 et al. 2007). In order to make sure that the\nspecified in Table 2. The other was run with a particle-mesh\nmass function is not suppressed due to this effect, the actual\n2 http://camb.info\nnumber of particles in a halo should be larger than this min-\n\n\fimal value. We find that \u223c 2000 particles per halo is a good\nchoice and hunt for matched halo pairs only above a corresponding mass of 2 * 1014 M\u2299 (or halos containing more than\n2500 particles). This being the case, we find that nearly 95%\nof the halos have their centers within \u223c 400 kpc (consistent\nwith the force resolution of the PM run). The ratio between\nthe matched halo masses averaged over all the matched pairs\nis shown as a histogram in Figure A15. As a function of mass\nbin (lower panel), the peak of the ratio distribution remains essentially unchanged, with median values ranging from 1.041 to\n1.034. Roughly speaking, the data is therefore consistent with\nan overestimate by approximately 4% in individual halo masses\nin the PM run, independent of the mass. (Note that the mean of\nthe ratio distribution has a slightly stronger dependence on halo\nmass, ranging from 1.06 to 1.036, resulting from tail effects in\nthe distribution.)\nSince the effect is small, a simple linear extrapolation is sufficient to correct each of the runs in Table 2 in order to predict\nthe halo mass in the limiting case. The corrected mass Mc is\ngiven by\nMc /M = 1.0 \u2212 0.04(\u01eb/650 kpc).\n(A1)\nHere M is the uncorrected halo mass and \u01eb is the force resolution measured in kpc of the different runs as specified in Table 2. (We have checked that this formula is consistent with\nanother smaller set of PM simulations \u2013 2563 particles, 10243\nmesh, with a force resolution of 334 kpc.) The biggest correction needed is \u2248 0.6% for individual halo masses for the A runs\n(with a force resolution of 97 kpc). This results in a systematic\nlowering of approximately 2% in the high-mass tail of the mass\nfunction (primarily run A) as shown in Figure A16.\n\ncounts\n\nMass Function Predictions Beyond \u039bCDM\n120000\n110000\n100000\n90000\n80000\n70000\n60000\n50000\n40000\n30000\n20000\n10000\n0\n\nr=347 kpc\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n1.1 1.2\nMPM/MG\n\n1.3\n\n1.4\n\n1.3\n\n1.4\n\n70000\n1.3- 2.8\n2.8- 6.9\n6.9- 11.0\n11.0- 42.0\n\n60000\n50000\ncounts\n\n16\n\n40000\n30000\n20000\n10000\n0\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n1.1 1.2\nMPM/MG\n\nError due to Finite Number of Particles in a Halo\nThe reason for the scatter and bias in FOF masses due to the\nfinite number of particles in a halo is that the FOF algorithm\naims to capture the mass of a halo within a certain iso-density\ncontour, rendering the halo mass sensitive to the accurate determination of this boundary. Undersampling of the halo will\nlead to particles on the halo boundary tending to link more to\nparticles close by than in the case of a well-sampled halo with\nthe end result of overestimating the halo mass (see Luki\u0107 et al.\n2009 for details).\nIn their work on the mass function, Warren et al. (2006) suggested a correction for the FOF halo mass of the form, ncorr\n=\nh\nnh (1 \u2212 n\u22120.6\n),\nwhere\nn\nindicates\nthe\nnumber\nof\nparticles\nin\na\nh\nh\nhalo. This adjustment is an empirical finding using a set of\nnested volume simulations. This correction factor has been\nused in recent studies, for example Tinker et al. (2008); Crocce et al.\n(2010). In broad outline this result is consistent with the findings of Luki\u0107 et al. (2009). The adjustment formula lowers\nmasses for halos with smaller numbers of particles and depends\nonly on the number of particles within a halo. Unfortunately,\nthis adjustment cannot be applied in all circumstances, as the\ndetails of the correction can depend on the details of the individual simulations. Additionally, this adjustment should not be\napplied at small particle numbers, where it is known to overcompensate.\nThe problem with FOF halo masses described above is best\nseen in our simulations by comparing results for the mass function in overlapping mass bins across the different-sized simulation boxes (with differing mass resolutions, see also Warren et al.\n2006). This is shown in the upper panel in Figure 2. In our work\nwe combine five different box sizes (multiple runs for each box\n\nF IG .

The figure shows the ratio of the raw simulation results from the five different box sizes with respect to\nour best-fit mass function. In the absence of a systematic bias\nacross the boxes, the results should match up within Poisson\nerrors, but this is clearly not the case.\nIn order to correct for the finite particle sampling of the halos we investigate different strategies. If all halos are NFW,\nthen following the analysis in Luki\u0107 et al. (2009) we can implement a correction which takes into account the concentration and the number of particles in a halo. The general trend\nis that higher concentration halos should have smaller corrections while, overall, the corrected halo masses would be lower\n(as in the simulations). Since our force resolution is not sufficient to reliably determine the concentration of the halos, we\ncan use the known mass-concentration relation (including scatter) to estimate a concentration for each halo. It turns out that\nsuch a correction lowers the mass function overall by almost\n10% but does not provide an accurate match between different boxes. Therefore, this simple modeling fails to explain the\nquantitative results from the simulations, presumably because\nthe concentration estimates are too crude and because of the\n\n\fBhattacharya et. al.\n\n17\n\nF IG .

Because we are using a simple, independent simulation box technique, we compute the variance for each of the runs \u2013 separately\nfor each fixed value of the simulation volume \u2013 over the number\nof realizations of each run. Thus for each run (A, B, C, etc.) we\ncalculate\nv\nu\n\u2206n 1 uX [(n(M, z) \u2212 n\u0304(M, z))2 ]\n(A3)\n= t\nn\nn\u0304 N\nNruns\nruns\n\nwhere Nruns is the number of realizations for a particular fixedvolume run (e.g., Nruns = 10 for the A runs). n\u0304 is the average\nnumber density of halos in a bin averaged over all the realizations and n is the number density for a single realization.

Note that the lower\nlimit of the integral is specified by the simulation box size. For\nthe larger boxes, this is irrelevant, but for the GS runs, the effect is significant, as also shown in Figure A18, which demonstrates good agreement between our results and the theoretical\nestimate. Note that by using independent smaller volume runs\nwe can reduce the error due to sample variance by a significant amount (of course one should keep in mind that too-small\nboxes will systematically bias the mass function low, a small\nand correctable bias in our case, as shown in Fig. 2).\n\nF IG .

Assuming we want to calculate the value\nof \u03b4c at z = 0, we require the sphere to collapse at z = 0. We\nset the initial conditions \u03b4i\u2032 = 0. We varied \u03b4i\u2032 and checked that\nthe final value of \u03b4c is quite insensitive to the value of \u03b4i\u2032 . We\nsolve Equation B1 such that \u03b4 becomes a large number at z = 0\n(numerically we attain convergence for \u03b4 = 108 ) for a chosen\ninitial perturbation, \u03b4i . We iteratively converge to the value of\n\u03b4i such that collapse happens at z = 0, i.e., \u03b4 = 108 at z = 0.\nOnce \u03b4i is computed by solving Equation B1, we use that value\nto solve Equation B2. The solution of Equation B2 gives the\nvalue of \u03b4c at z = 0. Thus, for a given cosmology, i.e., for given\nvalues of \u03a9m and w, solving Equations B1 and B2 gives \u03b4c at a\ngiven redshift, z.\n\u03b4 \u2032\u2032 +\n\n\u0012\n\nSPHERICAL COLLAPSE CALCULATION OF \u03b4cwcdm\n\nIn this section we summarize the calculation of \u03b4c for any\ncosmology as predicted by the spherical collapse model. We\nare interested in perturbations in a homogeneous sphere. The\nfull nonlinear equation for perturbations (Pace et al. 2010) is\n\nREFERENCES\nAbbott, T. et al.
