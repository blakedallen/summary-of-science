We make use of the fact\nthat the trailing string is the locus of the light delay in bulk to obtain the explicit form\nfor quark jets in the expanding plasma. From the trailing string solution we calculate\nthe drag coefficient of a heavy quark in the strongly coupled expanding plasma. The\nenergy scaling of the maximum penetration length of an ultrarelativistic light quark\njet using light rays in bulk is estimated.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma at RHIC/LHC is believed to be described appropriately by hydrodynamics at proper times 0.5 fm/c \u2264 \u03c4 . One solution to hydrodynamics\n\ndescribing a relativistic system with infinite extent in the perpendicular direction that is\nexpanding longitudinally was given by Bjorken [1]. An important probe for the strongly\ncoupled quark-gluon plasma is the quenching of quark and gluon jets [1].\nA useful tool to study real time dynamics of a particle within a strongly coupled medium\nis the holographic approach. Modeling jet quenching of ultrarelativistic quarks and gluons\nin holography by light rays falling towards a static black hole in holography was initially\nsuggested in [2, 3] and more recently in [4, 5]. Jet quenching of (non-)relativistic quarks and\ngluons has been described by trailing strings [6, 7] and trailing and falling strings [8, 9, 10];\nsee also [11, 12]. For another approach to jet quenching within holography see [13, 14].\nThe dynamics of quark jets at early stages of their evolution was studied in [15]. Falling\nstrings are commensurate with falling light rays in the ultrarelativistic limit bridging the\ngap between the two approaches.\nThe trailing string solution reveals momentum and energy dispersion relations for a heavy\nquark being dragged through a static, hot medium at a constant velocity. For a thermal\nmedium described by a static black hole, the drag coefficient following from the longitudinal\ntension of the dragged string is in agreement with expectations from Brownian motion [16]\nthanks to the Einstein relation.\nThe trailing string configuration can be thought of as the locus of the time delay of a\nlight signal propagating along the jet direction in bulk. Indeed, static quarks and gluons\nare threaded by a vertical color string in the holographic direction. As they are made to\nmove longitudinally in space, the vertical string follows causally with each point at a given\nholographic depth traveling with the speed of light corrected by the refraction index of the\nholographic medium. As a result, the string traces the locus of time delays [3].\nThis particular interpretation was made clear in [4, 5]. The surface of stationary phase\nof the solution to 'electromagnetic' waves (more precisely R-current) propagating in bulk\nis identical to the trailing string solution. We make use of this particular interpretation to\nconstruct trailing string solutions in a time dependent black hole background, which is dual\nto a time dependent expanding thermal plasma that asymptotes Bjorken hydrodynamics.\nOur explicit string construction supplements and confirms the non-equilibrium analysis of\nquark dragging in [17].\nIn section 2 we show how to obtain the trailing string solutions by following light rays\n1\n\n\fpropagating in bulk. Instead of using the full Maxwell description of 'electromagnetic' waves\nas in [4, 5], it suffices to study null geodesics in bulk as originally suggested in [2] in order\nto reproduce the solution to the string equations of motion. This 'eikonal approximation'\nholds for trailing strings in a static as well as expanding hot medium. In section 3, we\nthen construct the trailing string solution in a time dependent, thermal background, which\ndescribes an expanding, hot medium, that asymptotically agrees with Bjorken's solution\nfor large proper times. Energy and momentum dispersion relations, as well as the drag\ncoefficient are obtained. Another trailing string solution to this setup was worked out in\n[18], which we briefly review in the Appendix. The energy scaling of the stopping distance\nfor a quark jet in holography was studied in [8, 10, 13, 14]. In section 4 we approximate\nthe stopping distance for an ultrarelativistic light quark jet by analyzing a classical particle\nfalling in bulk on a null trajectory. Our conclusions are given in section 5.\n\n2\n\nStrings made out of light\n\nMotivated by the earlier idea on radiation in holography [2] and the recent wave analysis\nin [4, 5], we propose a simple way to construct the trailing string solution by looking at null\ngeodesics in bulk. We will now show that the solution to the string equations of motion,\nwhich is a string dual to a heavy quark moving on the boundary with constant velocity\nv(t) = v, is given by the envelope of the endpoints of light rays emitted from the quark at\nthe boundary at an earlier time t \u2212 td , where td = td (z) is the time (delay) it takes light to\n\ntravel along a null geodesic from the boundary (z = 0) to some finite z in bulk. The position\nof the string extending into the bulk is equal to the position of an observer who has first\ndetected the light signal emitted from the boundary at an earlier time. We illustrate this in\nFig. 1.\n\n2.1\n\nStatic medium\n\nWe parametrize the position of the light ray by (t(\u03bb), x(\u03bb), z(\u03bb)) with \u03bb an affine parameter.\nThe AdS5 -Schwarzschild metric characterizing a static medium at finite temperature reads\nR2\nds = 2\nz\n2\n\n\u0012\n\u2212f (z)dt2 + dx2 +\n\n2\n\n1\ndz 2\nf (z)\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\n\fx(t0 ,z=0)\n\nz=0\n\nx(t1 ,z=0)\n\nv\n\nx(t2 ,z=0)\n\nx\n\nv\n\nz=z H\n\nFigure 1: Light ray (dashed line) traveling from the boundary though the bulk.

As the black hole moves away from the boundary (zH = zH (t)) in the (t, z)-frame,\n7\n\n\fthe endpoint of the string has to reflect this dynamic behavior. At large times the medium is\ndescribed by (Bjorken) hydrodynamics satisfying the assumption of near local equilibrium.\nStatic properties of the quark are insensitive to the changes in the medium as the thermal\nmass correction, \u2206m0 = \u2206m0 (T0 ), is constant in time. Interpreting \u2206m0 as a screening\nmass, we would expect it to be proportional to T (t).

Note that although the string endpoint falls in the\n(t, z)-frame, the energy flow down the string is independent of the radial coordinate. While\nthe total energy of the quark is constant in the (t, w)-frame, the momentum decreases with\ntime.As the external electric force Ftx = \u2212\u03c0x1 weakens with time, the quark loses momentum\nand is asymptotically static. (Note that the medium does not expand in the x\u22a5 direction.)\n\nWe can now evaluate the drag coefficient \u03bc.

The result (38) is also\nin agreement with the Brownian motion analysis carried in [17] for a falling black hole and\nusing different approximations.\n\n5\n\nPenetration depth for a light quark jet\n\nFor a relativistic light quark jet traveling through an (expanding) medium, we give an estimate for the maximum penetration depth. A light quark is approximately described by a\nnull string whose endpoint is initialized at some finite radial coordinate and falls into the\nblack hole following a null geodesic [9, 10]. The approximation used is that long enough\nafter the initialization, once the endpoints of the string have traveled from the boundary to\nsome depth z\u2217 , the quarks flying away from each other can be represented by trailing string\nsolutions, where the string uniformly translates with a constant velocity and its endpoints\nfollow null geodesics. The excitation on the boundary will dissolve into the medium once\nthe endpoints of the string have reached the horizon and the energy scaling of the stopping\n\u0010\n\u221a \u00111/3\ndistance is (\u2206x(E))max \u2248 E/T \u03bb\n/T .\n\nFollowing the classical approximation used in [14], we approximate the maximum stopping\n\ndistance of a relativistic particle on the boundary by following light rays in bulk. We first\nconsider the case of a static medium, whose dynamics are described by the metric in (1). To\ndescribe a quark on the boundary with velocity v, we fix the constants of motion, (3),\n\u1e8b =\n\n\u03a0x\ndx\n=\nf = vf .\ndt\n\u03a0t\n\n(39)\n\nThe null geodesic reads\n\u017c =\n\ndz p\n= f (f \u2212 \u1e8b2 ) ,\ndt\n\n9\n\n(40)\n\n\fand the distance \u2206x the quark travels before the string reaches the horizon is given by\n\u2206x =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nzH\n\n\u1e8b\ndz =\n\u017c\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nzH\n\ndz p\n\nv\n1\u2212\n\nv2f\n\nFor ultrarelativistic motion, v \u2243 1 and finite\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nzH\n\ndz r\n\n0\n\n1\n,\n\u03b3\n\nv\n1\n\u03b32\n\n+\n\nv2\n\n\u0010\n\nz\nzH\n\n\u00114 .\n\n(41)\n\nthe energy dependence of the maximum\n\npenetration depth reads\n\n(\u2206x)max \u2248\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03b3zH \u2248\n\np\n\nE/Q\n,\nT\n\n(42)\n\nwhere we have assumed a dispersion relation of the form E = \u03b3Q.

However, the disperion relation for the string, compare (31),(33),\n\nsupports the identification Q = (T ). For very heavy quarks Q can be identified with the\np\nbare quark mass.

Heavy quark diffusion in such a\ncontext was originally discussed in [17] using certain assumptions. The current analysis\nthrough the trailing string confirms these findings without additional assumptions. Key to\nthe construction of the trailing string solution in the time dependent holographic background\nis the observation that the string in bulk is the locus of the light delays [3, 4, 5].\nThe falling black hole in bulk asymptotes Bjorken hydrodynamics, describing a longitudinally expanding plasma with infinite extent in the perpendicular spatial direction. The\ntime-delayed and approximate solution to the string equations of motion accounts for a quark\n\n10\n\n\fat constant velocity. Furthermore, an exact solution exists, representing a decelerated quark\nat the boundary with an asymptotically vanishing momentum (see Appendix).\nSince the holographic metric can be expressed in a coordinate frame in which the horizon\nis fixed in proper time, the essentials of the expanding medium are captured by a time\ndependent rescaling of the temperature. A falling black hole from t0 to t describes an\nexpanding and cooling medium from T (t0 ) = T0 to T (t) \u2248 T0 /\u03c4 1/3 . Heavy quarks with\n\ninitial thermal masses M(T0 ) = m \u2212 \u2206m0 are dragged with a dragging coefficient \u03bc M(T0 ) \u2248\n\n\u2206m0 T (t). The latter is the analog of the dragging in a static medium with fixed temperature.\n\u221a\nUltrarelativistic, on-shell quarks with energy E penetrate a distance (\u2206x)max \u2248 \u03b3zH \u2248\np\nE/M(T0 )/T (t) in the expanding plasma.\n\n7\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported in parts by the US-DOE grant DE-FG-88ER40388.\n\n8\n\nAppendix\n\nIn this Appendix we show that the falling black hole background (9) also admits an exact,\ndecelerated trailing string, which exhibits identical dragging to the trailing string solution\ndiscussed in the text. This solution was worked out in [18].

Since t \u221d t 3 , the quark moving\nw2\nalong the trajectory of the endpoint of the string at z = 0 is decelerated. The string solution\n11\n\n\f(46) describes a trailing string and every point on the string moves with the same velocity\nin the x-direction in the (t, w) frame. This is no longer true if we transform to the original\nvariables (t, z), since the black hole horizon is falling in these coordinates. The deceleration\nof the quark is proportional to the rate at which the temperature decreases, T (t) \u221d t\u22121/3 .\n\nFor the solution in (46), the densities read\n\u03c0t0\n\n=\n\n\u03c0t1 =\n\u03c0x0 =\n\u03c0x1 =\n\n\u221a\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03bb\n3t0 v 2 w 2\n1\n1\nq\n+\n4\n2\u03c0 1 \u2212 v 2 3t0 \u0001 w 2\n2t wH\nf\n2t\n\u221a\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03bb\n1\n3t0 v 2\nq\n2\n2\u03c0 1 \u2212 v 2 3t0 \u0001 2t wH\n2t\n\u221a\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3t0\n\u03bb\nv\n1\nq\n\u0001\n2\n2\u03c0 1 \u2212 v 2 3t0\n2t wH f\n2t\n\u221a\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3t0\n\u2212 \u03bb\nv\n1\nq\n,\n\u0001\n2\n2\u03c0\n2t wH\n1 \u2212 v 2 3t2t0\n\n(47)\n\n(48)\n\n(49)\n\n(50)\n\nresulting in the following dispersion relations using (27), (28)\n\n1\nE = \u03b3M(T0 ) + (\u2202t E) \u2206\u03be ,\nv\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3t0\n1\np =\nv\u03b3M(T0 ) + (\u2202t p) \u2206\u03be .\n2t\nv\n\n(51)\n(52)\n\nFor both the decelerated and the constant velocity solution, v is related to the initial quark\nvelocity.
