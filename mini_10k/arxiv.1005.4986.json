While the ferroelectric polarization cannot be explained by the well-accepted spin current model nor exchange\nstriction mechanism, we have shown that it is induced by the spin-dependent p-d hybridization\nbetween the transition-metal (Co) and ligand (O) via the spin-orbit interaction. On the basis of the\ncorrespondence between the direction of electric polarization and the magnetic state, we have also\ndemonstrated the electrical control of the magnetization direction.\n\nElectrical control of magnetism has long been an important subject in condensed-matter physics as well as\nan urgent issue in contemporary spin-electronics. One\nof the promising ways toward this goal is to make use\nof magnetoelectric effect (change of magnetization by\nelectric field, or reciprocally, change of electric polarization by magnetic field) in magnetic dielectrics[1\u20135]. The\nelectric-field control of magnetism in terms of the magnetoelectric effect is much less dissipative in energy than the\ncurrent control of magnetism in itinerant ferromagnets.\nWhile the magnetoelectric effect was thought to be quite\nsmall, the magnetically-induced ferroelectrics (multiferroics) and their giant magnetoelectric effect have recently\nbeen discovered and are now attracting much attention.\nThere are several microscopic mechanisms for the\nmagnetically-induced ferroelectricity. The most prevailing mechanism is the spin current mechanism[6],\nor equivalently the inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\nmechanism[7, 8]. In the transverse-helical (cycloidal)\nspin structure, the\nP spin chirality can induce the polarization P \u221d\ni,j eij \u00d7 (S i \u00d7 S i ) in terms of the\nspin current mechanism, where eij denotes the unit\nvector connecting the interacting neighbor spins S i and\nS j . In the crystal which contains multiple inequivalent\nmagnetic sites, even the collinear spin structure may\nalso induce ferroelectricity with use of magnetostriction caused by the symmetric exchange interaction\nJS i * S j [9]. This type of the ferroelectricity is realized in\nperovskite RMnO3 (R = Y, Ho,..., Lu)[10], DyFeO3 [11],\nand Ca3 (Co,Mn)2 O6 [12]. Quite recently, the third mechanism was proposed[13] to explain the ferroelectricity\ninduced by the proper screw or the 120\u25e6 spin structure\nin delafossite CuFeO2 [14] and CuCrO2 [15]. In these\nmaterials, the ferroelectricity can be caused by the\ntransition metal-ligand (p-d) hybridization depending\non the spin direction[16, 17]. Owing to the hybridization\nrelevant to the spin-orbit interaction, the ionic charge\n\u03c1 of the ligand can vary depending on the angle \u03b7\n\nbetween the spin of the transition metal and the vector\ne connecting the transition metal and the ligand, i.e.\n\u2206\u03c1 \u221d (S * e)2 . Therefore, the local electric polarization\n\u2206P \u221d (S * e)2 e exists between the transition metal and\nthe ligand. The induced charge of the local dipoles,\nwhen summed up over the whole crystal, may induce\nthe ferroelectricity. To examine the mechanism in more\ndetail, a more simple spin structure is desirable because\nthis is a single ion problem rather than a spin correlation\n(S i \u00d7 S j , S i * S j , etc.) one. In this paper, we show the\nferroelectricity and its magnetic-field dependence in a\nsimple staggered antiferromagnet Ba2 CoGe2 O7 that can\nbe throughly explained by such a spin-dependent p-d\nhybridization mechanism. We also demonstrate a novel\nelectrical response of magnetic properties based on this\nmechanism.\nFigure 1(a) illustrates the crystal structure of\nBa2 CoGe2 O7 . It forms the tetragonal noncentrosymmetric structure (space group P 4\u030421 m), composed of corner shared CoO4 and GeO4 tetrahedra and intervening\nBa2+ ions. The Co magnetic moments have easy plane\nanisotropy and show a staggered antiferromagnetic structure in the (001) plane below TN = 6.7 K[18]. There\nare only two inequivalent Co sites and this is unchanged\neven below TN . Therefore, the sum of the vector spin\nchirality is zero and the S i * S j is uniform for all the\nCo-Co bond. For this reason, neither the S i \u00d7 S j spincurrent mechanism nor the S i * S j exchange striction one\ncan work for this compound. However, the ferroelectric\npolarization is observed below TN under magnetic field\nas reported for this[19] and related compounds[20] (see\nalso Figs. 1(c) and (d) observed in the present study),\nwhile the microscopic origin has not been clarified. In\nthe following, therefore, we take the spin-dependent hybridization mechanism as the working hypothesis for the\nobserved polarization.\nAccording to the spin-dependent hybridization model,\nthe local polarization of the CoO4 tetrahedron can be\n\n\f2\n(a)\n\n+\u03ba\n\nP421m\nCo\nGe\nO\nBa\n\n(c)\n\n150\n\nCoO4(1)\n\nCoO4(2)\n\n5T\n\n50\n\n2\n\nP c (\u03bcC/m )\n\n100\n\n\u2212\u03ba\n\n[010] (b)\n\nH || [110]\n\nH || [100]\n\n0\n\nH || [001]\n\n-50\n\n-100\n\n[001] (c)\n\n[100] (a)\n\nH || [110]\n\n-150\n\n(b)\n\nH || [001+]\n\n(d)\n\nO1\n\n20\n\n5T\n\n\u03b73\n\nO3\n\n\u03b72\n\n2\n\n\u03b71\n\nPa (\u03bcC/m )\n\nO2\n\u03b74\n\nO4\n\nH || [110]\n\n0\n\nH || [100]\nH || [110]\n\nfield[21]. When H is applied along [110], P emerges along\nthe [001] direction. The sign of Pc is reversed by changing the H direction to [11\u03040] and Pc is almost zero under\nH k [100] and H k [001]. Figures 2(e) and (f) show the\nvariations of the magnetization (M ) and P at 2 K, respectively, with rotating H in the (001) plane (H = 1\nT). Here, \u03c6H is defined as the angle between [100] and\nthe H direction in the (001) plane as shown in Fig. 2(d).\nWhile the magnitude of M is nearly invariant with \u03c6H ,\nPc shows sinusoidal \u03c6H dependence with the 180\u25e6 period.\nThe variation of P with \u03c6H is in accord with the spindependent hybridization mechanism, as shown below.\nIn the magnetic field applied parallel to the magnetic\neasy (001) plane, the staggered magnetic moments tend\nto align nearly perpendicular to H and canted to the di-\n\n-20\nH || [001-]\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6 8\nT (K)\n\n\u03c6H = -45 \u030a \u03c6 '\n\n(a)\n\n10 12\n\n\u03c6H = 0 \u030a\n\n(b)\n\n\u03c6'\n\n[100]\n\nPa \u221d sin 2\u03b81 sin(2\u03ba \u2212 \u03c61 ) \u2212 sin 2\u03b82 sin(2\u03ba + \u03c62 ),\nPb \u221d \u2212 sin 2\u03b81 cos(2\u03ba \u2212 \u03c61 ) \u2212 sin 2\u03b82 cos(2\u03ba + \u03c62 ), (1)\nPc \u221d sin2 \u03b81 sin(2\u03ba \u2212 2\u03c61 ) \u2212 sin2 \u03b82 sin(2\u03ba + 2\u03c62 ).\nThe ferroelectric polarization and its magnetic-field dependence are well explained by this equation as discussed\nbelow.\nWe show the temperature dependence of P along [001]\n(Pc ) in Ba2 CoGe2 O7 under various magnetic field (H)\ndirections as shown in Fig. 1(c).

When the spin moment S is along the upper-lying oxygen bond O1 -O2 ,\nthe polarization appears along [001].

Therefore,\nin the case of the in-plane magnetic field, the spin directions \u03b81 , \u03b82 , \u03c61 , \u03c62 can be expressed as \u03b81 = \u03b82 = 90\u25e6 ,\n\u03c61 = \u03c6H \u2212 90\u25e6 + \u03c6\u2032 , \u03c62 = \u03c6H + 90\u25e6 \u2212 \u03c6\u2032 , where \u03c6\u2032 is\nthe canting angle of the spin and invariant with \u03c6H (Fig.\n2(a)). Putting these relations into Eq. (1), we obtain\nP \u221d (0, 0, sin 2\u03c6H cos(2\u03ba \u2212 2\u03c6\u2032 )). This relation clearly\nexplains the sinusoidal \u03c6H dependence of the polarization with the 180\u25e6 period shown in Fig. 2(f).\nNext we proceed to the response of P under out-ofplane magnetic field. The in-plane polarization in H\naround [001] largely depends on the deviation of the H\ndirection from [001]. In Fig. 1(d), we show the temperature dependence of the polarization along [100] (Pa ) in H\nalong various directions. When the magnetic field (5T)\nis applied along the direction slightly (\u223c 1\u25e6 ) slanted from\n[001] to [010] (denoted as H k [001+]), the positive polarization appears below TN . When the slanted direction is\nreversed i.e. toward [01\u03040] (H k [001\u2212]), the polarization\nis also reversed. The in-plane polarization is not observed\nunder the in-plane magnetic field.\nFigures 2(h) and (i) show the variations of M and P ,\nrespectively, at 2 K under rotating H = 5 T around\n[100]. The experimental set up is depicted in Fig. 2(g).\nHere \u03b8H is defined as the angle between the H direction\nand the [001] direction. In contrast with the case of the\nin-plane rotation of H, P is always along the [100] direction in this configuration (A small Pc signal was caused\nperhaps by the misalignment of the magnetic-field direction). As shown in Fig. 2(h), M shows sinusoidal \u03b8H\ndependence and takes a minimum value in H k [001], i.e.\nalong the magnetic hard axis. On the other hand, Pa\nshows the steep sign change around \u03b8H = 0\u25e6 and 180\u25e6\nand monotonically increases with the angle between the\nsign changes. Around \u03b8H = 0\u25e6 and 180\u25e6 , the rotational\nhysteresis is observed as shown in Fig. 2 (j).\nWhen the magnetic field is not parallel to the\nmagnetic-easy (001) plane (\u03b8H 6= 90\u25e6 or 270\u25e6 ), the canting angle of the staggered magnetic moments to the\nout-of plane direction is the same for the both sites\n(\u03b81 = \u03b82 = \u03b8\u2032 ; see Fig. 2 (l)). The observed magnetic\nanisotropy in Fig. 2(h) indicates that the angle difference between \u03b8\u2032 and \u03b8H (0 \u2264 \u03b8H \u2264 180\u25e6 ) or 360\u25e6 \u2212 \u03b8H\n(180 < \u03b8H \u2264 360\u25e6) becomes larger as \u03b8H approaches\n0\u25e6 or 180\u25e6 (H k [001]). For the in-plane component of\nthe staggered magnetic moments, the directions are expressed as \u03c61 = \u03c6H \u2212 90\u25e6 + \u03c6\u2032 , \u03c62 = \u03c6H + 90\u25e6 \u2212 \u03c6\u2032 ,\nrespectively. Here \u03c6H is the angle between the in-plane\nprojected field and the [100] direction (Fig. 2(a)), and \u03c6\u2032\nis the in-plane canting angle (see Fig. 2(l) for definition).\nPutting these relations into Eq. (1), we obtain\n\nP\u2297\n\n4K\n6K\n\n0\n\n[110]\n-100\n\nlarge H\n[110]\n\n0\n\n5\n\nH (T)\n\n10\n\n15\n\nFIG. 3: (color online) (a)Illustration of the spin-structural\nchange with increasing magnetic field along [110]. (b),(c) H(k\n[110]) dependence of (b) M (c) Pc at various temperatures\nas well as the calculated curve of Pc at 2 K based on the\nspin-dependent hybridization mechanism (see Eq. (1)). The\ndefinition of the structural parameter \u03ba is shown in Fig. 1(a).\n\nNow, we discuss the polarization as a function of\nH-magnitude to more decisively evidence the spindependent hybridization mechanism. Figure 3(c) shows\nthe magnetic-field (H k [110]) dependence of Pc up\nto 14 T at various temperatures. The polarization increases with H in the low-H region and then decreases\nand shows the sign change (\u2265 4 K) in the high-H region. The critical magnetic fields of the downturn and\nsign change increase with decreasing temperature. The\nsign change is expected by the spin-dependent hybridization mechanism because the magnetic moments are almost perpendicular to H in the low-H region but parallel in the high-H region, as shown in Fig. 3(a). In\nfact, the c-axis polarization can be expressed as Pc \u221d\n(1\u22122(M/MS)2 ) cos 2\u03ba+2(M/MS)(1\u2212(M/MS )2 )1/2 sin 2\u03ba\naccording to the Eq. (1). Here, M \u221d sin \u03c6\u2032 and MS =\n3 \u03bcB /Co2+ is the saturation value of M . As shown in\nFig. 3(c), the observed magnetic-field dependence of Pc\nat 2 K is well reproduced with the M values measured\nat 2 K in Fig. 3(b) and the structural value \u03ba = 24\u25e6 of\nthe isostructural compound Ca2 CoSi2 O7 [23], except for\nthe low-H region. In the low-H region, the discrepancy\nbetween the observed and calculated values is large; the\n\n\f4\nobserved polarization is minimal at H = 0 while the calculated value is finite. Perhaps, the polarization spontaneously forms a multi-domain structure to minimize the\nelectrostatic potential in the low-H region.\n[001]\n\n500\n\nM\n\n2\n\nPa (\u03bcc/m )\n\n[010]\n\nP\n0\nT=2K\nH // [001]\n5T\n\nM\n\n[001]\n[010]\n\n-500\n\nP\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\nhave shown the H dependent ferroelectric polarization\ncan be explained in terms of the spin-dependent p-d\nhybridization mechanism via the spin-orbit interaction.\nThis is the first qualitative examination of this mechanism for multiferroicity. In addition, we have demonstrated the novel magnetoelectric functionalities such as\nthe electric-field drive of the magnetization flop around\nthe magnetic hard axis direction.\nThe authors thank I.

Pa reversal is equivalent to the magnetization flop\naround [001] as shown in the insets. Incidentally, the large\nE-linear term in Pa comes from the paraelectric component\n\u01ebr \u01eb0 E, where \u01ebr \u223c 10 and \u01eb0 is the dielectric constant in the\nvacuum.\n\nOn the basis of the correspondence between the directions of P and M as clarified above, we demonstrate here\na novel electric response of magnetism in Ba2 CoGe2 O7 .\nFigure 4 shows the P -E curve obtained in H k [001] at\n5 T at 2 K. Prior to the measurement, the H direction\nwas carefully aligned to [001]. In this case, two magnetic\nstates shown in the inset of Fig. 4 are degenerate; the\nnet magnetic moment is tilted from [001] to [010] directions in one state, while the tilting direction is reversed\nin the other state. (There are other degenerate states\nwhose net magnetic moment is in the (010) plane. Nevertheless, these magnetic states cannot be controlled in\nterms of the electric field along [100].) We applied the\nelectric field along [100] to obtain the clear P -E curve.\nSince the sign of the transverse (k [010]) component of\nthe M for H k [001] is tied to the in-plane P direction\nas shown in Figs. 2 (k) and (l), the observed P reversal indicates the magnetic domain switch as expressed\nby the inset scheme in Fig. 4. In this case, the E reversal causes the large-M (\u223c 0.4 \u03bcB /Co2+ ) flop around the\nmagnetic hard axis within 2\u25e6 . This is contrastive with\nthe previous results of the electric-field control of magnetization for the canted antiferromagnet (Cu,Ni)B2 O4\nwith a similar noncentrosymmetric crystal structure[24],\nwhere the electric field can switch the tilting angle of the\nmuch smaller magnetization (\u223c 6 \u00d7 10\u22123\u03bcB /Cu2+ ) up to\n\u00b130\u25e6 from [100] within the magnetic-easy (001) plane.\nIn conclusion, we have studied the magnetoelectric\nproperties of the staggered antiferromagnet with the noncentrosymmetric crystal structure Ba2 CoGe2 O7 .
