By\nmatching the discrete distribution in the continuous limit with the Kerr disk densities, we derive\nthe quantized energy and momentum states of the superluminal orbits. We conclude that the KerrNewman disk may be modeled as a Dirac sea of these superluminal states and we identify possible\nexcited states of the disk.\n\narXiv:0806.1674v2 [gr-qc] 16 Jun 2008\n\nPACS numbers: 04.20.-q, 03.75.Ss\n\nThe Kerr-Newman metric [1, 2] is an exact, stationary, axially symmetric vacuum solution of the coupled\nEinstein-Maxwell field equations and describes the gravitational field of a mass endowed with angular momentum\nand charge. Newman et al. [2] originally obtained this\nmetric from a complex coordinate transformation of the\nReissner-Nordstrom metric, a procedure [3] that previously was shown to transform the Schwarzschild solution\ninto the rotating Kerr metric. The Kerr vacuum is often\nused to model black holes, however, it may be also used\nto model the exterior gravitational field of a rotating astrophysical mass, provided the solution is assumed to be\nvalid outside some compact region of the object.\nOne may define a coordinate r in the Kerr manifold,\nwhich can be defined geometrically as an affine parameter along either of the two congruences of principal null\ngeodesics. This coordinate functions as an asymptotic\nradial coordinate at spatial infinity. At r = 0, the Kerr\ngeometry possesses an equatorial disk that is centered\non the axis of symmetry. In the absence of charge, this\ndisk is intrinsically flat and of radius |a| = mJ00c , where\nm0 and J0 are the gravitational mass and angular momentum observed at large r. On the boundary of the\ndisk there is a geometrical singularity. In addition, the\nKerr-Newman field exhibits the Dirac gyromagnetic ratio, twice that of a classical distribution.\nIsrael [4] investigated the source of the Kerr-Newman\nfield and derived the mass, angular momentum, and\ncharge distributions on the disk using the theory of surface layers in general relativity. He adopted the interpretation that the complete Kerr manifold is defined so that\nr \u2265 0 everywhere and that the discontinuity in the normal derivative of the metric across the equatorial disk at\nr = 0 is due to a layer of mass and charge. Israel discovered that the material component of the disk rotates with\nsuperluminal velocity and that the charge rotates with\nsubluminal velocity, both approaching the speed of light\nas r \u2192 |a|. He discovered that the disk has negative surface energy, charge, and angular momentum densitites,\nthat diverge to \u2212\u221e as one approaches the ring singular-\n\n\u2217 email:\n\nrdbock@gmail.com\n\nity. He postulated that this is rectified at the singular\nring by a positively infinite mass, angular momentum,\nand charge.\nSince classical densities are generally viewed as distributions possessing an underlying quantized structure, we\nexamine Israel's distributions in the context of discrete\norbital states. In particular, we model the material component of the Kerr disk as superluminal particles with intrinsic spin undergoing orbital rotation, restricted by the\nde Broglie quantization condition [5]. We conclude that\nthe material component of the Kerr disk may be modeled\nas a Dirac sea of superluminal particles. We derive the\nquantized energy states and examine what restrictions\nquantum theory has on the occupancy at each level. We\nalso discuss excitations of the disk and implications for\nthe mass spectrum of the fundamental particles.\nIn order to model the material component, we use the\nuncharged Kerr disk since the mass and charge densities\nrotate at different speeds. In this case the disk is intrinsically flat and r may be considered the radial coordinate.\nTaking kinetic and gravitational potential energy into account, the \"effective\" energy density is [4]:\n\u03c3ef f = \u2212\n\nm0 c2\n1\n.\n2\u03c0a2 1 \u2212 r2 \u00013/2\na2\n\n(1)\n\nThe material component of the disk rotates with superluminal speed v/c = a/r > 1 as measured by a stationary\nobserver at infinity. In addition, the annulus from r to\nr + dr contributes angular momentum:\ndr\nm0 c \u0010 r \u0011 3\ndJ = \u2212\n.\n(2)\n2 \u00013/2\n2\na\n1 \u2212 ar 2\nIsrael noted that both the energy and angular momentum diverge as r \u2192 |a|, therefore, he concluded that the\nsingular ring must contribute an infinite positive mass\nand angular momentum, in order to yield the finite net\nobserved values m0 and J0 .\nWe model the material density as quantized superluminal particles [6] of (imaginary) mass \u03bc with angular\nvelocity v/c = a/r > 1. We write the total energy of\nthese states as\nE= q\n\n\u03bcc2\nv2\nc2\n\n\u22121\n\n+ V (r),\n\n(3)\n\n\f2\nwhere V (r) is a potential that binds the particles to the\nsingular ring. The momentum of each state is:\n|p| = q\n\n\u03bcv\nv2\nc2\n\n.\n\nso that:\ndn\n1\n.\n= l\u22121\n2 \u00013/2\ndr\n1 \u2212 ar 2\n\n(4)\n\n\u22121\n\nNote that the four-momentum of the free superluminal\nstate is a space-like vector and c2 p2 \u2212 E 2 = \u03bc2 c4 . We\nassume that the particles are bound to the singular ring\nby the potential V(r) and obey Fermi-Dirac statistics so\nthat they are supported in their orbits by degeneracy\npressure. In other words, we assume that the centripetal\nacceleration (Fc ), binding force (Fb ), and supporting degeneracy force (Fd ), bind the particles such that:\nFd = Fc + Fb ,\n\nTherefore, using Equations (8), (9), (10), and (12), we\nobtain:\n\u0012 \u0013\ndE\nm0 c2\nl\nr\n=\u2212\n(13)\n\u0010 \u00112\ndn\na\na/l\n1+ n\nand\n\uf8ee\n\u0012 \u0013\nJ0 l \uf8ef\ndJ\n=\u2212\n\uf8f0\u0010\ndn\n2 a\n\n(5)\n\nwith v/c = a/r > 1. Below we will examine this assumption more carefully.\nIt can be shown (see Appendix) that the de Broglie [5]\nquantization condition can be derived for the superluminal states. Therefore, we consider the following quantization condition:\n\u03bcvr\nq\n= n~,\n(6)\nv2\nc2 \u2212 1\n\nand\n\ndE\nr\nm0 c2\n= (2\u03c0r)\u03c3ef f = \u2212 2\n2 \u00013/2\ndr\na\n1 \u2212 ar 2\n1\nm0 c \u0010 r \u0011 3\ndJ\n=\u2212\n.\n2 \u00013/2\ndr\n2\na\n1 \u2212 ar 2\n\n(8)\n\ndE\ndE dn\n=\ndr\ndn dr\ndJ dn\ndJ\n=\n.\ndr\ndn dr\nUsing Equation (7) we write:\n\u0010a\u0011\n1\nq\nn=\nl\na2\n\u22121\nr2\n\nJ0\nJ =\u2212\n2\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\n(14)\n\nl\n\n(15)\n\n\uf8ee\n\u0012 \u0013\nl \uf8f0 n2 + 2\nq\na\nn2 +\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\u0001\na 2\nl\n\uf8fb\n\u0001\na 2\nl\n\n+ J (0) ,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere E (0) and J (0) are constants of integration. Note\nthat J gives the total angular momentum (orbital + intrinsic spin) present at orbital n. In order for the continuum of states to be filled throughout the disk, we\nmust assume that the superluminal particles obey FermiDirac statistics, otherwise, only the lowest energy state\n(n = \u221e) would be filled. It does not necessarily follow,\nhowever, that they are spin-1/2 particles [6], although it\nis possible. We can solve for the constants of integration by evaluating the above at n = 0, since the velocity\nv = \u221e is allowed in the superluminal regime. Noting\nthat at n = 0 the particle energy is E = V (r = 0) and\nthe orbital angular momentum vanishes, we obtain:\n\n(9)\n\nUsing these Kerr distributions, we may calculate the total\nenergy and angular momentum present at each quantum\nnumber n by noting:\n\nn2 +\n\n\uf8fa\n\u00113/2 \uf8fb .\n\u0001\n2\na\n\nand\n\n(7)\n\n~\n. In the limit that al \u2192 \u221e Equation (7)\nwhere l \u2261 \u03bcc\nyields a continuum of states. We demand that when this\ncontinuum of states is filled it reproduces the energy and\nangular momentum densities of the Kerr disk (Equations\n(1) and (2)), which we write as:\n\nn\n\n\uf8f9\n\n3\n\nIntegrating the above equations gives:\n\u0012 \u0013r\n\u0010 a \u00112\nl\n2\n+ E (0)\nn2 +\nE = \u2212m0 c\na\nl\n\nwhere v/c = a/r. This gives the following quantized\nradii:\n1\nr\n= r\n\u0010 \u00112 ,\na\n1 + a/l\nn\n\n(12)\n\nE (0) = m0 c2 + V (r = 0)\n\n(17)\n\nJ (0) = J0 + sz (n = 0),\n\n(18)\n\nand\n\nwhere sz (n = 0) is the projection of the total intrinsic\nspin of the superluminal particles in the state n = 0\nalong the axis of symmetry.\nSince the magnitude of the orbital angular momentum\nincreases by integral values of ~ as n increases, one must\nassume that the total intrinsic spin accounts for the nonlinear functional change in J. Therefore, we write:\nJ = \u2212f n~ + sz (n),\n\n(19)\n\n\f3\nwhere f is the number of particles in each state and\n\uf8ee\n\u00012 \uf8f9\n\u0012 \u0013\nJ0 l \uf8f0 n2 + 2 al \uf8fb\nq\nsz (n) = \u2212\n\u00012\n2 a\nn2 + al\n+J0 + sz (n = 0) + f n~\n\n(20)\n\nis the total intrinsic spin along the axis of symmetry of\nthe superluminal particles as a function of n. In the\ncontinuous limit ( al \u2192 \u221e) with low n, al \u226b n, Equations\n(15) and (20) become:\n\u0012\n\u00132\nn\nm0 c2\n+ V (r = 0)\n(21)\nE\u2243\u2212\n2\na/l\nand\n\"\n\nJ0\nsz (n) \u2243 \u2212\n4\n\n\u0012\n\nn\n(a/l)\n\n\u00134\n\n#\n\n\u2212 f n~ + sz (n = 0).\n\n(22)\n\nThe opposite limit al \u226a n can be realized either in the\nlimit al \u226b 1 as n \u2192 \u221e or in the limit al \u226a 1 so that\na\nl \u226a n for all n.

Thus,\nwe assume that Equations (15) and (16) are valid for all\na\nl , understanding that this may not necessarily be the\ncase outside of the limit in which they were derived.\nNote that it may be impossible to populate states\nabove some maximum orbit, nmax , depending on the intrinsic spin of each superluminal particle, the number of\nsuperluminal particles per orbit, and the angular momentum of the Kerr metric observed at large r, because the\nmagnitude of sz may unbounded and there will be a limit\nto the number of particles allowed at each orbit. In the\nlimit al \u226a n this occurs if\n\u0010a\u0011\n.\n(25)\nJ0 > 2f ~\nl\nIn general, the states between a minimum orbit, nmin ,\nand a maximum orbit, nmax , will be occupied. nmin\ndefines the highest occupied energy level and nmax represents the lowest occupied energy level. The Kerr disk is\n\nrealized in the continuous limit ( al \u2192 \u221e) with nmin = 0\nand nmax = \u221e, so that the entire disk is a Dirac sea of superluminal states. If the magnitude of sz is unbounded,\nfor example, according to (25), then the disk may still be\ncompletely filled, however, one must then introduce an\ninfinite number of non-identical superluminal particles\nas n \u2192 \u221e. We will not examine the resulting gravitational field here for a partially-filled Kerr disk, however,\nit would be of interest to see whether or not some of\nthe problems associated with the Kerr-Newman metric,\nsuch as closed timelike curves and naked singularities, are\nresolved by restricting the occupancy to a finite orbital\nrange.\nExcitations will occur for changes in the occupancy at\na given orbital state. For example, a particle at state n\nmay be ejected from the disk. If no other particles enter\nthe disk during this transition then a \"hole\" will exist\nat the previously occupied orbit. This hole, which represents an absence of negative mass and negative angular\nmomentum, will manifest itself as an increase in the gravitational mass m0 and angular momentum J0 of the disk\nas measured at spatial infinity. Similarly, an empty or\npartially filled orbital state may be filled by capturing an\nexternal superluminal particle or from transitions within\nthe disk. In addition, if an empty or partially filled orbit\nexists on the disk near nmin , then excited states of the\ndisk exist for the transition n \u2192 n\u22121, which will increase\nboth m0 and J0 of the disk.\nNote that angular momentum (cf. Equation (16)) may\nseverely restrict such processes. If we demand that Equation (16) holds before and after any changes in the disk\noccupancy, then the transitions must satisfy the selection\nrule\n\u2206J = 0.\n\n(26)\n\nConsequently, many transitions will either be forbidden\nor will be accompanied by a realignment of the intrinsic\nspins in order to satisfy Equation (26).\nA filled orbital state at nmax may capture a nonidentical superluminal particle; this may or may not be\naccompanied by the ejection of a superluminal particle,\ndepending on the selection rule (26). Consider the following scattering process for a Kerr metric with gravitational\nmass m0 and angular momentum J0 that is filled up to\nan orbit nmax . A superluminal particle of mass \u03bca and\nspin sa at orbit nmax may be replaced by another superluminal particle of mass \u03bcb and spin sb . In terms of a\nFeynman diagram, this will appear as an interaction betwen an incoming particle (m0 , J0 ) with the incoming superluminal particle (\u03bcb , sb ), resulting in an outgoing particle of different mass and angular momentum (m\u22170 , J0\u2217 )\nand an outgoing superluminal particle (\u03bca , sa ). If the selection rule (26) is satisfied during this interaction then\nthis scenario resembles certain weak interactions, since it\nhas been speculated that neutrinos travel at superluminal speeds [7]. For example, in the example above, an\nelectron (m0 , J0 ) and a muon neutrino (\u03bcb , sb ) may be\nconsidered the incoming particles, and a muon (m\u22170 , J0\u2217 )\n\n\f4\nand an electron neutrino (\u03bca , sa ) may be considered the\noutgoing particles, with J0 = J0\u2217 .\nThis suggests that the above Dirac sea model of the\nKerr-Newman disk [8] may be used to model the electron; furthermore, the muon and tau may be identified as\nexcited states of the electron. Note that the appropriate\nlimit for the electron is al \u226a n, since the neutrino masses\nare believed to be much smaller than the electron mass.\nOf course, there are well-known problems with identifying the Kerr-Newman field with the gravitational field of\nan electron because the corresponding gravitational field\nis a naked singularity and, moreover, it possesses closed\ntimelike curves. However, it was suggested above that\nthe disk may not be completely filled because of angular\nmomentum considerations and the resulting gravitational\nfield may differ from the Kerr-Newman metric, possibly\nresolving such issues. In fact, if one demands that Equation (24) is satisfied for all orbital states, then only the\nn = 0 state can be populated, since the spin of the neutrino is not sufficient to accommodate the higher (n > 0)\norbital states. Thus, the electron may be viewed as the\nopposite limit of the Kerr disk, being a singular ring with\na single superluminal state (electron neutrino) bound at\nn = 0, with all other states unoccupied. In addition, one\nmay identify the muon and tau as excited states of the\nelectron. These excited states may be realized by the superluminal replacement process described above (an incoming muon neutrino or tau neutrino and an exiting\nelectron neutrino). The only excited states that exist\ncorrespond to the number of superluminal particles that\ncan interchange with the electron neutrino, which must\nbe identified with the lowest energy state when bound\nto the singular ring. Thus, it is the number of neutrino\ntypes that restricts the number of members in the lepton\nfamily. It follows that the electron-muon and electrontau energy differences correspond to the differences in\nbinding energy of the bound superluminal states.\nThe above model also provides insight into the structure of the weak bosons and quarks. Examination of the\nFeynman diagrams for weak interactions suggests that a\nfundamental lepton consists of the associated neutrino\nbound to a charged weak boson at the n = 0 state.\nFor example, the electron consists of an electron neutrino bound to a W \u2212 boson. It follows that the charged\nweak boson consists of the charged component of the disk\nand the singular ring. Using the example stated above\nwith an incoming electron and muon neutrino and an\noutgoing muon and electron neutrino, the W \u2212 boson can\nbe viewed as transferring the singular ring and charged\ncomponent of the disk from the electron to the muon\nneutrino, resulting in an outgong muon. Similar considerations suggest that the neutral Z 0 boson consists of the\nangular momentum component of the singular ring. In\naddition, consider an incoming electron and up quark and\nan outgoing electron neutrino and down quark, mediated\nby the W \u2212 boson. Again, the W \u2212 boson can be viewed\nas transferring the singular ring and charged component\nof the disk to the up quark, resulting in a down quark.\n\nThus, the quarks may be considered charged excitations\nof the disk. This will be discussed in more detail in a\nfollowing communication.\nIn closing, we discuss the binding potential V (r). Of\nthe four fundamental interactions, only the weak and\ngravitational forces may be considered to be the binding potential, since the neutrinos do not respond to the\nstrong and electromagnetic forces. However, it does not\nseem possible to satisfy the velocity condition v/c = a/r\nwith either gravity or the weak force. More research in\nthis direction is required. If such efforts ultimately fail,\nthen one will be led to postulate a new force to bind the\nsuperluminal particles to the singular ring.\n\nI.\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nFollowing de Broglie's original analysis [5], we derive\nthe orbital quantization condition (6) of the superluminal\nstates. The energy and momentum of a free superluminal\nparticle are given by Equation (3) with V (r) = 0 and\nEquation (4), respectively. Note that |pc| > E and the\nvelocity may still be defined by v/c = |p|/E > 1. Unlike\ntheir subluminal counterparts, the range of velocity is\n\u221e \u2265 |v| > c, with v = \u221e permitted. In addition, the\ncorresponding ranges of energy and momentum are:\n0\u2264 E <\u221e\n\u03bcc \u2264 |p| < \u221e.\n\n(27)\n\nNote that energy and momentum reverse roles in the superluminal regime, with the lower bound of energy vanishing and the lower bound of momentum remaining finite.\nIn his original analysis, de Broglie postulated a periodic phenomenon exp(i\u03bd0 t) in the rest frame (v = 0) of\nthe particle with frequency defined by:\nh\u03bd0 = m0 c2 .\n\n(28)\n\nHe noted that this relationship remained relativistically\ninvariant if \u03bd0 was interpreted as the frequency of a wave.\nConsequently, the relationship p = h/\u03bb followed from this\ninterpretation.\nWe define the superluminal \"rest\" frame of the particle as v\u221e = \u221e. In this frame, the energy vanishes,\nand therefore Equation (28) must be replaced by a relationship with the non-vanishing \"rest\" momentum. Following de Broglie, we postulate a periodic phenomenon\nexp(ik0 x) in this rest frame with\n~k0 \u2261 h/\u03bb = \u03bcc.\n\n(29)\n\nUnder a Lorentz boost of velocity u, this becomes:\n\uf8ee \uf8eb\n\uf8f6\uf8f9\nx\n\u2212\nut\n\uf8f8\uf8fb .\nexp \uf8f0ik0 \uf8ed q\n(30)\n2\n1 \u2212 uc2\n\n\f5\nTherefore, under the Lorentz boost, the periodic phenomenon becomes:\n~k0\n.\n~k = q\n2\n1 \u2212 uc2\n\n(31)\n\nHence, Equation (29) is relativistically invariant if k is\nassociated with a wave of frequency:\nu/c\n\nh\u03bd = \u03bcc2 q\n1\u2212\n\nu2\nc2\n\n.\n\nv\u221e \u2212 u\n\u0001.\n1 \u2212 uvc2\u221e\n\n\u03bcv\nh\n= q\n\u2261 p.\n\u03bb\nv2\n\u2212\n1\n2\nc\n\n(33)\n\n[1] R.
