We show that the conductance quantization depends on whether the contact region is superconducting or ferromagnetic as well as on the strength of the exchange field in the ferromagnet. The\nAndreev reflection of the ferromagnetic contact is more suppressed than that of the superconducting\ncontact. We also show that the conductance-voltage curve has a bump at zero bias-voltage if there is\nno interfacial-scattering. On the contrary, the conductance-voltage curve shows a dip if the system\nhas an interfacial-scattering.\n\nscattering between the ferromagnet and superconductor.\nOn the contrary, the conductance-voltage curve shows a\ndip for the contact with an interfacial-scattering.\nWe consider the system consisting of three cylinders as\nshown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). The left and right electrodes with a diameter WE are connected by the contact\nwith a diameter WC (< WE ) and a length D. We employ\nthe simple Stoner model with exchange field h for the\nferromagnet.\n\nThe spin-dependent transport through a magnetic\nnano-structures is of current interest both in fundamental physics and application to spin-electronics [1]. The\nmagnetic quantum point contact is one of these magnetic\nnano-structures, which exhibit rich and elegant physics\n[2\u20134] and have potential applications such as magnetic\nrecording devices [5\u20137]. Recently much attention has\nbeen focused on magnetic point contacts with superconducting electrode since it is shown that the spin polarization of the conduction electrons can be measured by\nusing the Andreev reflection [8\u201312].\nDe Jong and Beenakker have shown that the Andreev\nreflection in a ferromagnet(F)/superconductor(S) point\ncontact is strongly suppressed as the Fermi surface polarization is increased [2]. The Fermi surface polarization, P , is defined as P = (N\u2191 \u2212 N\u2193 )/(N\u2191 + N\u2193 ),\nwhere N\u2191(\u2193) is the number of transmitting channels in\nthe spin-up(spin-down) band. If N\u2193 < N\u2191 then only\n2N\u2193 = N\u2193 + N\u2191 (N\u2193 /N\u2191 ) channels are available for the\nAndreev reflection and the corresponding conductance\nis G = 4N\u2193 e2 /h. Therefore, the Andreev reflection is\nstrongly suppressed if P is large. The suppression of the\nAndreev reflection in F/S point contacts has been observed experimentally by several groups [8\u201312]. Their\nresults are qualitatively well explained by de Jong and\nBeenakker's theory.\nNow we believe that the narrow F/S point contact\nwhere the conductance is quantized is within the current\nnano-technology. It is then needed to study the spindependent transport through narrow F/S point contacts\ntaking account of the geometry of contact and the mixing of channels. In this paper, we theoretically study\nthe spin-dependent transport through narrow F/S point\ncontacts, where the Andreev reflection plays an important role. We show that the conductance quantization\ndepends on whether the contact region is superconducting or ferromagnetic as well as on the strength of the\nexchange field. The Andreev reflection of the ferromagnetic contact is more suppressed than that for the superconducting contact. For the ferromagnetic contact, the\nwidth of the contact where the new transmitting channel\nopens increases with increasing the exchange field. We\nalso show that the conductance-voltage curve shows a\nbump at zero bias voltage if the system has no interfacial-\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\nz\nWC\n\nr\n\nf\n\nWE\nD\n\nFIG. 1.

The\nexchange field is h(z) = 0 for the superconductor and\nh(z) = h for the ferromagnet. The constriction potential is V (r) = \u221e outside the constriction represented by the shadow in Fig1(b). Inside the constriction, V (r) = (h\u03042 kF Z/m)\u03b4(z \u2212 z0 ), where Z represents\nthe interfacial-scattering potential at position z0 . We assume that the superconducting energy gap \u2206(T ) is con1\n\n\fstant and neglect the proximity effects [11].\nThe stationary scattering state is obtained by connecting wave functions at the boundary of contact [13,14].\nSince the system has cylindrical symmetry, wave functions \u03a8\u03c3 can be written as\n\u03a8\u03c3 (r) =\n\nX\nn,l\n\nl\nn\nN\u03c3n\n\u03c8\u03c3l\n(z)Jn (\n\n2\u03b3nl\nr)ein\u03c6\nWE(C)\n\nkln\u00b1\n\n(7)\n(8)\n\nThe wave vectors above the superconducting energy gap\n(E > \u2206(T )) are the same as those given by Eq.(8) except\nfor the wave vector kln\u2212 in the right electrode. In order to\ndeal with the evanessent waves, we write the wave vector\nkln\u2212 as\n\u0012r\n\u0013\u2217\n\u0011\np\n2m \u0010\n2\u03b3nl 2\nn\u2212\n2\n2\nkl =\n.

Even when the contact is superconducting(F/S/S), the conductance is suppressed due to the\nmismatch of the Fermi wavelength as shown in Fig. 2(a).\nHowever, the magnitude of suppression is smaller than\nthat for the F/F/S system.\nFigures 3(a) and 3(c) show the conductance(G)voltage(V) curves for the F/S/S system and Figs.3(b)\nand 3(d) show those for the F/F/S system. The conductance is normalized by that for the F/normal-metal(N)\ncontact. One can see that the conductance for the F/F/S\nsystem is smaller than that for F/S/S system since the\nnumber of transmitting channels are limited by the Andreev reflection.\nIn order to investigate the effect of the interfacialscattering, we plot the G-V curve for the interfacialscattering of Z = 0.3 in Figs.3(c) and 3(d). Without the\ninterfacial scattering, Z = 0, the G-V curve has a bump\nat zero bias voltage as shown in Figs.3(a) and 3(b). However, the G-V curve for Z = 0.3 shows dip as shown in\nFigs.3(c) and 3(d). These dip and bump in the G-V curve\nare similar to the energy dependence of conductance for\nF/S tunnel junctions discussed by \u017duti\u0107 and Valls [?].\n\n20\n10\n0\n4\n\n30\n20\n\n(b) F/F/S\nh = 0.0\nh = 0.3\nh = 0.6\nh = 0.9\n\n2.5\n\n2.5\n\n(a) F/S/S\n2.0\nZ=0.0\n\n10\n\n0\n12\n16\n20\n4\n8\n12\n16\n20\nkF WC\nkF WC\nFIG. 2.

Note\nthat the width WC at which the new transmitting channel opens increases with increasing the exchange field, h.\nThe shift of the conductance steps can be explained as\nfollows. In the ferromagnetic contact, electrons in the\nspin-up and spin-down bands feel the different exchange\nfield \u2212h and h, respectively. Therefore, the number of\ntransmitting spin-down channels N\u2193 is smaller than that\nof transmitting spin-down channels N\u2191 . As pointed out\nby de Jong and Beenakker. The number of channels contributing to the Andreev reflection is restricted by N\u2193 .\nIn the adiabatic picture [18], N\u2193 is determined by the\ncondition that (2m/h\u03042 )(\u03bcF \u2212 E \u2212 h) \u2212 (2\u03b3nl /WC )2 > 0.\nTherefore, the conductance steps shift leftward with increasing the exchange field.\nIn the narrow F/F/S system, the suppression of the\nAndreev reflection discussed by de Jong and Beenakker\nappears as the shift of the width of the contact WC\nat which the new transmitting channel opens as shown\n\nh=0.0\nh=0.3\nh=0.6\nh=0.9\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.0\n-4\n\n(b) F/F/S\nZ=0.0\n\nGFFS /GFFN\n\nh = 0.0\nh = 0.3\nh = 0.6\nh = 0.9\n\nGFFS /GFFN\n\n(a) F/S/S\n\nGFSS /GFNN\n\n30\n\nConductance [2 e2/h]\n\nConductance [2 e2/h]\n\nnumber of open channels.

The diameter\nof electrodes and the length of contact are taken to be\nWE = 60.8/kF and D = 5.0/kF , respectively. The superconducting energy gap is assumed to be \u2206(0)/\u03bcF =\n1.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 , which is of the same order of that for Al\n[17]. The position of the interfacial-scattering is located\nat z0 = \u2212D/2(+D/2) for the F/S/S (F/F/S) system.\nIn Fig. 2 (a) the zero-bias conductance of the F/S/S\nsystem is plotted against the width of contact WC .

However, as the exchange field increases, the\nconductance is suppressed due to the mismatch of the\nFermi wavelength as shown in Fig. 2(a).\n\n0.5\n\n-2\n\n0\n\neV/D(0)\n\n2\n\n4\n\n0.0\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\neV/D(0)\n\nFIG. 3. The conductance for the F/S/S and F/F/S point\ncontacts is plotted against the bias voltage at T = 0. The\nwidth of the contact is taken to be kF WC = 18.5. The\nstrength of the interfacial-scattering Z is assumed to be zero\nfor panels (a) and (b), and Z = 0.3 for panels (c) and (d). The\nhorizontal axis represents the applied bias voltage normalized\nby the superconducting gap \u2206(0) at T = 0. The solid, dotted, dashed and dot-dashed lines represent the conductance\ncurves for the h0 = 0, 0.3, 0.6 and 0.9, respectively.\n\nComparing our theory with the experimental results of\nSoulen et al. [8,9], we conclude that in their experiments\nthere is no interfacial-scattering in the contacts with Ni,\nNiFe and Co film, whereas the interfacial-scattering exists in the contacts with NiMnSb, La0.7 Sr0.3 Mn3 and\nCrO2 film.\nSoulen et al. [8] have also studied the conductance of\n3\n\n\feven at T /Tc = 0.4.\nIn conclusion, we theoretically study the Andreev reflection of narrow F/S point contacts. We show that the\nconductance depends on whether the contact is superconducting or ferromagnetic as well as on the strength\nof the exchange field in the ferromagnet. The conductance of the ferromagnetic contact is more suppressed\nthan that of the superconducting contact. For the ferromagnetic contact, the width of the contact where the\nnew transmitting channel opens increases with increasing\nthe exchange field. We also show that the conductancevoltage curve has a bump at zero bias-voltage if there\nis no interfacial-scattering between the ferromagnet and\nsuperconductor. On the contrary, if the contact has an\ninterfacial-scattering, the conductance-voltage curve has\na dip at the zero bias-voltage.\nThis work is supported by a Grand-in-Aid for Scientific Research from MEXT.

They found the difference in\nthe G-V curve near zero bias voltage and concluded that\nthis difference is due to varying amounts of interfacialscattering, Z. However, we propose that such difference\nin the G-V curve can occur if the material of the contact\nis different: one system has the superconducting contact\nand the other system has the ferromagnetic contact. We\nalso insist that the spin-polarization obtained by analyzing the experimental date [10\u201312] depends strongly on\nwhether the contact region is ferromagnetic or superconducting.\nIn Figs.4(a)-4(d), we show the G-V curve of the F/F/S\nsystem at T /Tc = 0.2 and 0.4. The horizontal axis is\nnormalized by the superconducting energy gap \u2206(T ).\nThe temperature dependencies of the G-V curves for the\nF/S/S system are not shown since they are similar to\nthose for the F/F/S system shown in Figs.4(a)-4(d).\n2.5\n\n2.5\nh=0.0\nh=0.3\nh=0.6\nh=0.9\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n0.0\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\neV/D(T)\n\n2.5\n\n2.5\n\n(c) T/Tc=0.2\n2.0\nZ=0.3\n\nh=0.0\nh=0.3\nh=0.6\nh=0.9\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n(d) T/Tc=0.4\nZ=0.3\n\nh=0.0\nh=0.3\nh=0.6\nh=0.9\n\nGFFS /GFFN\n\nGFFS /GFFN\n\n[1] G.
