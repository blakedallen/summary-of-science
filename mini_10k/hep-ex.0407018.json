The\ncross sections are measured for the transverse momentum range of the photons 5 < ET\u03b3 <\n10 GeV and for associated jets with ETjet > 4.5 GeV. They are measured differentially as\na function of ET\u03b3 , ETjet , the pseudorapidities \u03b7 \u03b3 and \u03b7 jet and estimators of the momentum\nfractions x\u03b3 and xp of the incident photon and proton carried by the constituents participating in the hard process. In order to further investigate the underlying dynamics, the angular\ncorrelation between the prompt photon and the jet in the transverse plane is studied. Predictions by perturbative QCD calculations in next to leading order are about 30% below the\ninclusive prompt photon data after corrections for hadronisation and multiple interactions,\nbut are in reasonable agreement with the results for prompt photons associated with jets.\nComparisons with the predictions of the event generators PYTHIA and HERWIG are also\npresented.\n\nTo be submitted to Eur.

This contrasts with\njet measurements, where the partonic structure is obscured by the non-perturbative hadronisation process. Furthermore, experimental uncertainties associated with the transverse energy\nmeasurement are smaller for the electromagnetic showers initiated by photons than for the measurement of jets of hadrons. This paper presents results from the H1 experiment at HERA on\nthe photoproduction of isolated prompt photons, both inclusively and in association with a jet.\nHere photons are called \"prompt\" if they are coupled to the interacting quarks (see Fig. 1), in\ncontrast to photons which are produced as decay products of hadronic particles.\nNext to leading order (NLO) perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations have proved broadly\nsuccessful in reproducing measured jet production rates from various colliders, provided hadronisation corrections are applied. In contrast, discrepancies have been observed between data\non prompt photon production and NLO pQCD calculations in pp, p\u0304p, pN (see e.g. [1]) and\nin \u03b3p [2] interactions. These discrepancies can be reduced by introducing intrinsic transverse\nmomentum kT to the incoming partons of the proton [1, 3] or by soft gluon resummations [4].\nNLO pQCD calculations of prompt photon production in photoproduction [5\u20139] are available,\nin which the incident photon interacts with the partons of the proton either directly (Fig. 1a,b)\nor via its \"resolved\" partonic structure (Fig. 1c,d). This paper investigates the extent to which\nfixed order NLO calculations are able to describe the new data. The data are also compared\nwith the predictions of the event generators PYTHIA [10] and HERWIG [11] and with data on\ninclusive prompt photon production from the ZEUS collaboration [2].\n\n2 Strategy of Prompt Photon Measurement\nThe photoproduction process is initiated by quasi-real photons, which are produced in small\nangle ep scattering, where the scattered electron1 escapes into the beam pipe. The requirement\nof a significant energy loss in the electron beam direction, together with the condition that no\nelectrons are found in the selected events, suppresses contributions from neutral current (NC)\ndeep inelastic scattering (DIS).\nPhotons are identified in the H1 liquid argon (LAr) calorimeter [12] as compact electromagnetic clusters with no track associated to them. The main experimental difficulty is the\nseparation of the prompt photons from hadronic backgrounds, in particular \u03c0 0 meson decays,\nsince at high energy the decay photons cannot be reconstructed separately in the calorimeter.\nSince the \u03c0 0 mesons are predominantly produced in jets, this background is strongly reduced\nby requiring the photon candidates to be isolated from other particles.\nAfter the selection cuts described below, the \u03c0 0 background is still of similar size to the\nprompt photon signal. To extract the signal, different shower shape variables are combined\n1\n\nThe term \"electron\" is used for both electrons and positrons.\n\n4\n\n\fto form a discriminator function which is fitted with a sum of contributions from simulated\nphotons, \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 mesons. The fit is done double-differentially in bins of transverse energy ET\u03b3\nand pseudorapidity \u03b7 \u03b3 . 2\nThe number of selected prompt photon events is corrected for detector effects by detailed\nsimulations of prompt photon production in the H1 detector, using the event generators PYTHIA\nand HERWIG.\n\n3 Event Selection\nThe data were collected in the years 1996-2000 with the H1 detector [13] at HERA in data\ntaking periods where electrons or positrons with energy Ee = 27.6 GeV collided with protons\nof energies Ep = 820 GeV or Ep = 920 GeV. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity\n\u22121\n+\nof 105 pb\u22121 of\u221awhich 28.8 pb\u22121 and\nat center of\n\u221a 61.3 pb were recorded in e p interactions\n\u22121\nmass energies s = 301\n\u221a GeV and s = 319 GeV, respectively, and 14.9 pb were recorded\nin e\u2212 p interactions at s = 319 GeV.\nThe events are triggered by compact energy depositions in the LAr calorimeter, consistent\nwith electron or photon showers. The trigger efficiency is \u2248 60% at photon energies of 5 GeV,\nreaching 100% at \u2248 12 GeV.\nThe main requirements for the event selection are the following [14].\n\u2022 A compact electromagnetic energy cluster, consistent with a \u03b3 shower, is reconstructed\nin the LAr calorimeter in the range \u22121 < \u03b7 \u03b3 < 0.9 and ET\u03b3 > 5 GeV. For the data at\n\u221a\ns = 301 GeV a threshold ET\u03b3 > 7 GeV is required.3 The \u03b7 \u03b3 range corresponds to the\ncentral barrel region of the LAr calorimeter [12].\n\u2022 No track is allowed to point to this cluster within a distance of 25 cm in the plane transverse to the track at the calorimeter surface.\n\u2022 Events with electron candidates in the LAr calorimeter or in the backward calorimeter\nSPACAL [15] are rejected. This restricts the virtuality of the exchanged photon to Q2 < 1\nGeV2 and suppresses contributions from radiative DIS and QED Compton processes.\n\u2022 At least two tracks are required in the central tracker [13, 16], which covers the angular\nrange 20\u25e6 < \u03b8 < 160\u25e6 . This cut assures good reconstruction of the event vertex, which is\nrequired to be within \u00b135 cm in z of the nominal vertex position.\n\u2022 The inelasticity\ny = W 2 /s, where W is the \u03b3p center of mass energy, is evaluated as\nP\ny =\n(E \u2212 pz )/2Ee . Here the sum runs over all detected final state particles. The\nrequired range 0.2 < y < 0.7 corresponds to 142 < W < 266 GeV for Ep = 920 GeV.\nThe cut at high y reduces NC DIS background. The cut at low y removes beam gas\nbackground.\n2\n\nThe pseudorapidity \u03b7 of an object with polar angle \u03b8 is given by \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2), where \u03b8 is measured\nwith respect to the z axis given by the proton beam direction. Transverse energies are also measured with respect\nto this axis unless\n\u221aotherwise specified.\n3\nThe data at s = 301 GeV were taken prior to the upgrade of the LAr electronics, after which lower trigger\nthresholds became possible.\n\n5\n\n\f\u2022 The \u03b3 candidate is required to be isolated. The transverse energy, ETcone , in a cone around\nthe \u03b3 candidate, given by distances below 1 unit in the (\u03b7 \u2212 \u03c6) plane, is required to be\nless than 10% of ET\u03b3 . A further cut to remove non-prompt photon background is based\non the shower shape, as described in section 4.\n\u2022 Associated jets are reconstructed using the inclusive kT algorithm [17] with a distance\nparameter D = 1 in the (\u03b7 \u2212 \u03c6) plane. The jets are selected in the jet energy and pseudorapidity ranges ETjet > 4.5 GeV and \u22121 < \u03b7 jet < 2.3, respectively. If more than one jet\nis found, only the jet with the highest ETjet is considered.\n\n4 Signal Extraction\nThe prompt photon signal is extracted using a shower shape analysis based on the expectation\nthat showers initiated by photons are typically narrower than \u03c0 0 or \u03b7 initiated showers, with\nless energy deposited in the first calorimetric layer on average. This procedure exploits the fine\nsegmentation of the electromagnetic section of the LAr calorimeter, which has transverse cell\nsizes varying between about 5 \u00d7 7 cm2 and 7 \u00d7 13 cm2 in the central barrel region. This part\nof the calorimeter has three layers in depth, corresponding to \u2248 20 radiation lengths. The first\nlayer has a thickness of about 3 radiation lengths.\nThree observables are\ndiscriminate against background. The mean transverse shower\nPused toP\nradius is given by R = i ri \u03b5i / i \u03b5i , where ri is the transverse distance of cell i with energy\ndensity \u03b5i measured with respect to the axis from the event vertex to the center of gravity of the\n\u03b3 candidate cluster. The shower hot core fraction (HCF ) is the largest energy fraction of the\ncandidate shower which is contained in 4 or 8 contiguous cells (depending on the calorimeter\ngranularity) including the cell of highest energy. Finally the first layer fraction (F LF ) is the\nenergy fraction of the shower contained in the first, i.e. closest to the beam, layer of cells of the\ncalorimeter. The observables R and F LF are expected to be smaller and HCF to be larger for\nthe prompt photon showers than for background showers.\nTo discriminate between photon and background showers, probability densities for the three\nobservables R, HCF and F LF are determined by simulation of photons and \u03c0 0 mesons [14].\nThe products of these three densities are used as likelihood functions. For each measured event\na discriminator (d) is formed by the likelihood for photons divided by the sum of the likelihoods\nfor photons and \u03c0 0 mesons. The discriminator d produces larger values for prompt photons than\nfor the pairs of photons from \u03c0 0 or \u03b7 meson decays. This can be seen in Fig. 2a, where the measured distribution of d is shown together with the prompt photon and background components\nestimated from the PYTHIA Monte Carlo simulation. The lowest bin in Fig. 2a contains mostly\nbackground (\u2248 90%) which is composed of 65% \u03c0 0 , 30% \u03b7 and 5% other particles. After a\ncut d > 0.125, the remaining background (\u2248 50%) is composed of 94% \u03c0 0 , 5% \u03b7 and about\n1% other particles. Fig. 2a shows that the distribution in the discriminator d of signal plus\nbackground is well predicted by PYTHIA.\nThe contribution of prompt photons is determined by maximum likelihood fits of simulated\nphoton, \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 meson discriminator distributions to the data distribution for d > 0.125. Each\nmeasurement presented in section 6 is obtained by summing the results of such fits performed\n6\n\n\findependently in 6 \u00d7 6 bins of \u03b7 \u03b3 and ET\u03b3 . In this procedure, only the \u03b7/\u03c0 0 ratio (on average\n5% after the selection requirements) is taken from PYTHIA.\nThe measured distributions of R, HCF and F LF for the full \u03b7 \u03b3 and ET\u03b3 range are shown\nin Fig. 2b-d together with the contributions of photons and \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 background, the normalisations of which are taken from the fits to the discriminator distributions described above. The\ndata distribution is well described by the extracted signal and background components. The\ndiscrimination between signal and background becomes weaker at high ET\u03b3 , where the R and\nHCF distributions of \u03c0 0 mesons and photons become more similar to each other. Therefore\nevents with ET\u03b3 > 10 GeV are not included in the results presented below.\n\n5 Monte Carlo Generators and Corrections to the Data\nThe event generators PYTHIA [10] and HERWIG [11] are used 4 to correct the observed event\nyields for apparatus effects by means of a full simulation of the H1 detector. The average corrections from the two generators are applied. Both generators are based on leading order (LO)\nQCD matrix elements and leading log parton showers. Hadronisation is provided in PYTHIA\nby Lund string fragmentation [18] and in HERWIG by the decay of colourless parton clusters.\nBoth generators model additional soft remnant-remnant interactions, termed multiple parton\ninteractions (m.i.) in the following. The GRV(LO) [19] parton densities are used for the photon and the proton. In contrast to HERWIG, PYTHIA simulates radiation of photons from the\nelectron line and photon production via fragmentation of final state quarks and gluons in di-jet\nevents. In PYTHIA the parameter describing the intrinsic kT of initial state partons in the proton is k0 = 1 GeV (default) leading to < kT >= 0.9 GeV. HERWIG predictions are shown for\nthe default value kT = 0.\n\u221a\nA correction\u221afactor of about 1.04 is applied to the s = 301 GeV\n\u221a data in order to combine\nwith the data at s = 319 GeV. The final results are presented for s = 319 GeV. Background\nfrom DIS events where the scattered electron fakes the prompt photon signatures due to tracker\ninefficiency leads to a subtraction of 3% in the lowest \u03b7 \u03b3 bin at high ET\u03b3 , and is negligible\notherwise. Following the selection criteria described in section 3, other sources of background\nare negligible.\n\n6 Systematic Uncertainties\nThe following sources of systematic errors are considered.\n\u2022 The dominant systematic errors are due to possible imperfections in the simulation of the\nshower shapes. The quality of the simulated distributions of R, HCF and F LF is tested\nby comparing simulations of electrons with electron candidates from NC DIS events.\nDifferences between the data and the simulation in these distributions result in errors on\nthe prompt photon cross sections ranging from \u00b110% to \u00b120%.\n\n4\n\nPYTHIA 6.15/70 and HERWIG 6.1 are used with default multiple interactions (MSTP(82)=1 for PYTHIA,\nPRSOF=1, BTCLM=1 for HERWIG).\n\n7\n\n\f\u2022 The uncertainties on the calorimeter electromagnetic and hadronic energy scales (0.7%\nto 1.5% and \u2248 3% respectively) contribute errors of about 5% for the inclusive cross\nsections. For the case with associated jets, the hadronic energy uncertainty gives rise to\nuncertainties of about 10%.\n\u2022 The trigger efficiency is determined using independent triggers with an uncertainty of 3%.\n\u2022 The model dependence, of the corrections for detector effects is quantified as half the difference (< 6% in most cases) between the correction factors obtained with PYTHIA and\nHERWIG. Within these uncertainties the results are insensitive to reasonable variations\nof the ET\u03b3 dependence and of the underlying event activity in PYTHIA.\nAn overall normalisation uncertainty of \u00b11.5% on the luminosity measurement is not included in the results. The total systematic errors are obtained by adding the different systematic\nerrors in quadrature. For further details see [14].\n\n7 Results\nThe results are presented in tables 1 to 3 and figures 3 to 6 as bin averaged ep cross sections in\nthe kinematic region defined by\n\u221a\ns = 319 GeV, 0.2 < y < 0.7, Q2 < 1 GeV2\nand 5 < ET\u03b3 < 10 GeV, \u22121 < \u03b7 \u03b3 < 0.9, ETcone < 0.1 * ET\u03b3 .\nThe inner error bars on the data points in the figures indicate the statistical errors as obtained\nfrom the shower discriminating fits. The full error bars also contain the systematic errors added\nin quadrature.\n\n7.1 Inclusive prompt photons\nDifferential cross sections d\u03c3/dET\u03b3 and d\u03c3/d\u03b7 \u03b3 for inclusive prompt photon production are\nshown in Fig. 3 and are compared with the predictions of the PYTHIA [10] and HERWIG [11]\nevent generators. The cross sections are reasonably described in shape, but the predictions by\nPYTHIA (HERWIG) are low by about 40% (50%) in normalisation. Photons from fragmentation in di-jet events are only treated in the PYTHIA calculation, which explains the difference\nfrom HERWIG. The figure shows the full PYTHIA prediction and separately the contribution\nof direct photon interactions only. The PYTHIA prediction is also shown without multiple interactions. The predictions at 0 < \u03b7 \u03b3 < 0.9 are about 25% higher without multiple interactions,\nshowing that the cross section is reduced by the soft underlying event activity, as expected [6]\ndue to the isolation cone condition ETcone = 0.1 * ET\u03b3 . Fig. 3 also shows a comparison with the\nresults of the ZEUS collaboration [2].5 The two measurements are consistent.\n5\n\u03b3\n\u221a The ZEUS data are obtained in the somewhat different kinematic region 0.2 < y < 0.9, \u22120.7 < \u03b7 < 0.9,\ns = 301 GeV and are adjusted to correspond to the H1 conditions using the NLO calculation [6].\n\n8\n\n\fThe results are further compared in Figs. 4a,b with the NLO pQCD calculations by Fontannaz, Guillet and Heinrich (FGH) [6] and Krawczyk and Zembrzuski (K&Z) [8, 9]. The two\ncalculations are similar, the main difference being that only FGH apply higher order corrections\nto the resolved photon processes (Fig. 1c,d). The final state photon can be emitted in a hard\npartonic process or can be produced in the fragmentation of a quark or gluon. The photon isolation requirement in the cross section definition suppresses the latter contribution considerably.\nAccording to the calculations, the contribution to the cross sections from fragmentation is typically 10%. Both calculations use the photon and proton parton density functions AFG [20] and\nMRST2 [21], respectively, and BFG [22] fragmentation functions. The transverse energy ET\u03b3 is\nused for the renormalisation and factorisation scales. In order to obtain a realistic comparison of\ndata and theory, the NLO calculations are shown after correction from the parton to the hadron\nlevel including the effects of multiple interactions (m.i.). These corrections are obtained using\nthe average of PYTHIA and HERWIG, taking half the difference as an uncertainty estimate.\nThe resulting uncertainty is typically 3% as shown by the outer error bands in Figs. 4a,b.\nThe FGH (K&Z) NLO calculations are typically 30% (40%) below the data in most of the\nand \u03b7 \u03b3 ranges presented in Figs. 4a,b, if the corrections for hadronisation and m.i. are\napplied. The comparison with the parton level result of FGH shows that the correction factors\nare largest at high \u03b7 \u03b3 , where resolved photon interactions contribute most. Only here (\u03b7 \u03b3 > 0.6)\nthe corrections improve the agreement with the data. The NLO corrections are substantial, with\nthe NLO/LO ratio increasing from 1.2 to 1.4 for FGH with increasing \u03b7 \u03b3 . The effect on the NLO\ncalculations of scale variations is rather small as shown by the inner error bands in Fig. 4a,b,\nwhich indicates the effect of the variation of the renormalisation and factorisation scales from\n0.5 * ET\u03b3 to 2 * ET\u03b3 . The predictions are about 10% larger on average if the GRV parton density\nand fragmentation functions [19, 23] are used.\nET\u03b3\n\n7.2 Prompt photons with jets\nCross sections for the production of a prompt photon associated with a jet are presented in\nFigs. 4c,d as a function of the variables ET\u03b3 and \u03b7 \u03b3 and in Fig. 5 as function of ETjet , \u03b7 jet, xLO\n\u03b3 and\n\u03b3 \u2212\u03b7jet\n\u03b3 \u03b7jet\nLO\nLO\n\u2212\u03b7\u03b3\nLO\n\u03b7\u03b3\nxp . The estimators x\u03b3 = ET (e\n+ e )/2yEe and xp = ET (e + e )/2Ep are taken\nfor the momentum fractions of constituents of the incident photon and proton, respectively,\nparticipating in the hard process. These observables make explicit use only of the photon energy,\nwhich is better measured than the jet energy. They are thus most easily interpreted in the\nleading order (LO) approximation where the outgoing partons from the hard interaction, and\ncorrespondingly the reconstructed photon and jet, have equal transverse momenta. The use of\nLO\nthe variable xLO\n\u03b3 was recommended in [7, 20] to reduce infrared sensitivity. The variable xp is\ndiscussed e.g. in [24].\nThe data are compared with the pQCD calculations. In contrast to the inclusive case, both\nNLO calculations are consistent with the data in most bins. The NLO/LO correction ratios for\nd\u03c3/d\u03b7 \u03b3 are more moderate than in the inclusive case, ranging from about 0.95 to 1.25 with\nincreasing \u03b7 \u03b3 for FGH (Fig. 4d), but are still large in some bins of other distributions, as shown\nin Fig. 5. The hadronic and m.i. corrections, which are applied for both NLO calculations,\nimprove the description of the data only in some regions, such as \u03b7 \u03b3 > 0.6, \u03b7 jet < \u22120.3 and\nxLO\n< 0.6. The xLO\ndistribution (Fig. 5c) is particularly sensitive to the photon structure\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\n9\n\n\ffunction. Using the GRV parameterisation [19, 23], the K&Z prediction increases by about\n4% for xLO\n> 0.85 and by about 20% at xLO\n< 0.85 where resolved photon contributions\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\ndominate, leading to a somewhat improved description of the data.\nFurther understanding of the dynamics of the process and in particular of the effect of higher\norder gluon emissions beyond the diagrams shown in Fig. 1 may be obtained from the transverse\ncorrelation between the prompt photon and the jet. The distribution of the component of the\nprompt photon's momentum perpendicular to the jet direction in the transverse plane,\np\u22a5 \u2261 | ~pT\u03b3 \u00d7 p~Tjet | / | ~pTjet | = ET\u03b3 * sin(\u2206\u03c6) ,\nwhere \u2206\u03c6 is the difference in azimuth between the photon and the jet, is determined by higher\norder effects as p\u22a5 is zero at leading order, where the prompt photon and the jet are back-to-back\nin the transverse plane.\n> 0.85 and\nThe normalised p\u22a5 distribution is shown in Fig. 6 separately for the regions xLO\n\u03b3\nLO\nx\u03b3 < 0.85, where direct and resolved photon induced processes dominate, respectively (contributing about 80% in each case according to the FGH calculation). The FGH NLO prediction\ngives a better description of the p\u22a5 distributions than K&Z. This is due, at least in part, to the\ndifferences between the QCD corrections for resolved photon interactions in the two calcula> 0.85, the data are quite well described by PYTHIA, whereas the HERWIG\ntions. For xLO\n\u03b3\nprediction is somewhat harder than that of the data. For xLO\n< 0.85, the measured distribution\n\u03b3\nis reasonably well described by both Monte Carlo models, except in the region of p\u22a5 \u2248 5 GeV.\nThe p\u22a5 distribution at large x\u03b3 has previously been used [3] to extract information on an intrinsic kt of the initial state partons of the proton. However, the large differences between the\npredictions of the various NLO calculations and Monte Carlo models in the present comparisons\ndo not allow a reliable statement to be made.\n\n8 Conclusions\nThe photoproduction of prompt photons, both inclusively and associated with jets, is studied.\nThe measured \u03b7 \u03b3 and ET\u03b3 distributions of the inclusive prompt photons are reasonably well\ndescribed in shape by NLO pQCD calculations, but after corrections for hadronisation and\nmultiple interactions the predictions are 30%\u221240% below the data. The cross sections predicted\nby the PYTHIA and HERWIG event generators describe the data distributions well in shape\nwith normalisations that are low by about 40% \u2212 50%.\nFor prompt photons associated with a jet, the data are somewhat better described by the NLO\ncalculations including corrections for hadronisation and multiple interactions. This, together\nwith the fact that the NLO corrections are smaller on average than in the inclusive case, suggests\nthat contributions beyond NLO are less important if an energetic jet is selected together with\nthe prompt photon.\nThe distribution of p\u22a5 , the component of the prompt photon's momentum perpendicular to\nthe jet direction in the transverse plane, is sensitive to effects beyond LO. The PYTHIA generator describes the normalised p\u22a5 distributions quite well, whereas HERWIG predicts too hard\na p\u22a5 distribution at large xLO\n\u03b3 , where direct photon interactions dominate. Particularly at low\n10\n\n\fxLO\n\u03b3 , the p\u22a5 distribution is better described by the NLO calculations if NLO QCD corrections\nare also applied in the case of the resolved photon interactions.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to the HERA machine group whose outstanding efforts have made this experiment possible.

The data are compared with NLO pQCD calculations\n(K&Z [9], dotted line, and FGH [6], solid line). The NLO results are corrected for hadronisation\nand multiple interaction (h.c. + m.i.) effects (see text). The outer error bands show the estimated\nuncertainties on these corrections for the example of FGH, added linearly to the effect of a\nvariation of the renormalisation and factorisation scales in the NLO calculation from 0.5 * ET\u03b3\nto 2 * ET\u03b3 (inner band).
