(2) What is the nature of cold dark matter? (3)\nWhy is there more matter than antimatter in the present Universe? Each question has\nseveral different good answers, but they are generally unrelated. In this note, combining one\nestablished idea and two recent ones, it is pointed out for the first time that all three may have\na simple common origin, arising from the interactions of a single term, with experimentally\nverifiable consequences.\nIt has been known for a long time that neutrino mass and baryogenesis may be related\nthrough the canonical seesaw mechanism [1, 2, 3] and leptogenesis [4]. The idea is very\nsimple. The SM is augmented by three heavy neutral singlet fermions Ni (often referred\nto as right-handed neutrinos) which have large Majorana masses Mi . Through the Yukawa\ncouplings\nLY = h\u03b1i (\u03bd\u03b1 \u03c60 \u2212 l\u03b1 \u03c6+ )Ni + H.c.,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere (\u03bd\u03b1 , l\u03b1 ), \u03b1 = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 , are the three left-handed lepton doublets, and (\u03c6+ , \u03c60 ) is the SM\nHiggs scalar doublet, the unique dimension-five operator for Majorana neutrino mass [5]\nL\u039b =\nis realized with f\u03b1\u03b2 /\u039b =\n\nP\n\ni\n\nf\u03b1\u03b2\n(\u03bd\u03b1 \u03c60 \u2212 l\u03b1 \u03c6+ )(\u03bd\u03b2 \u03c60 \u2212 l\u03b2 \u03c6+ ) + H.c.\n2\u039b\n\n(2)\n\nh\u03b1i h\u03b2i /Mi . As \u03c60 acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value\n\nh\u03c60 i = v, a neutrino mass matrix (M\u03bd )\u03b1\u03b2 = f\u03b1\u03b2 v 2 /\u039b is generated [1, 2, 3]. At the same time,\nthe heavy Majorana fermions Ni may decay into either \u03bd\u03c60 and l\u2212 \u03c6+ or their antiparticles\nin the early Universe, and establish a lepton asymmetry [4], which gets converted into the\npresent observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe through sphalerons at the electroweak\nphase transition [6]. The interactions of Eq. (1) together with Mi are thus responsible for\nboth neutrino mass and baryogenesis. What is missing is just dark matter.\n\n2\n\n\fTo include dark matter, it has recently been recognized [7] that a very simple change of\nEq. (1) is all one needs, i.e.\nLY = h\u03b1i (\u03bd\u03b1 \u03b7 0 \u2212 l\u03b1 \u03b7 + )Ni + H.c.,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere (\u03b7 + , \u03b7 0 ) is a second scalar doublet, and an exactly conserved Z2 symmetry has been\nassumed, under which (\u03b7 + , \u03b7 0 ) and Ni are odd, with all other particles even. This means\nthat h\u03b7 0i = 0 and Ni are not the Dirac mass partners of \u03bd\u03b1 as in the canonical seesaw model.\nNevertheless, a Majorana neutrino mass matrix M\u03bd is obtained in one loop [8], as depicted\nin FIG. 1.\n\n\u03bd\u03b1\n\n\u03c60\n\n\u03c60\n\n\u03b70\n\n\u03b70\nNi\n\n\u03bd\u03b2\n\nFigure 1: One-loop generation of neutrino mass.\n\u221a\n0\nLet \u03b7 0 = (\u03b7R0 + i\u03b7I0 )/ 2 and mR,I be the mass of \u03b7R,I\n, then\n(M\u03bd )\u03b1\u03b2 =\n\nX\ni\n\nh\u03b1i h\u03b2i Mi\nm2R\nm2R\nm2I\nm2I\nln\n\u2212\nln\n.\n16\u03c0 2\nm2R \u2212 Mi2 Mi2 m2I \u2212 Mi2 Mi2\n\"\n\n#\n\n(4)\n\nThe immediate consequence of the exact Z2 symmetry of this model is that the lightest\n0\nNi or \u03b7R,I\nis a candidate for the cold dark matter of the Universe. Assuming that Ni is\n\nthe cold dark matter, it has been shown [9] that its relic abundance is compatible with\nobservation only for mR,I less than about 350 GeV, for which the experimental upper bound\nof 1.2 \u00d7 10\u221211 on the branching fraction of \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 implies a lower bound on the mass of the\nlightest neutrino of order 0.05 eV. This result is of course very interesting, but it goes against\n3\n\n\fleptogenesis because the interactions of Eq. (3) must then be lepton-number violating at the\nelectroweak scale and would wash out any lepton asymmetry even if it were somehow created\nat higher energies.\nThere is however another option. Instead of Ni , consider \u03b7R0 or \u03b7I0 as the cold dark matter\n[10]. In that case, its relic abundance does not have to depend on the interactions of Eq. (3),\nbut rather on its gauge and scalar interactions. This allows Mi to be much heavier than\nmR,I in Eq. (4) which reduces to\n(M\u03bd )\u03b1\u03b2 =\n\nX\ni\n\nMi2\nMi2\nh\u03b1i h\u03b2i\n2\n2\n.\nm\nln\n\u2212\nm\nln\nR\nI\n16\u03c0 2 Mi\nm2R\nm2I\n#\n\n\"\n\nCompared to the canonical seesaw formula of (M\u03bd )\u03b1\u03b2 =\n\nP\n\ni\n\n(5)\n\nh\u03b1i h\u03b2i v 2 /Mi , it is reduced by\n\na factor of about 16\u03c0 2 , assuming MR2 ln(Mi2 /MR2 ) \u2212 MI2 ln(Mi2 /MI2 ) is of order v 2 . This\nmeans that the Davidson-Ibarra bound [11] on leptogenesis is now reduced by 16\u03c0 2 , and\nthe lightest Ni needs only to be heavier than about 2.5 \u00d7 107 GeV, well below a possible\ngravitino bound of 109 GeV. In the decay of Ni to either \u03bd\u03b7 0 and l\u2212 \u03b7 + or their antiparticles,\nnot only is a lepton asymmetry created, but also dark matter. At temperatures below the\nsmallest Mi , of order 107 to 1011 GeV, the interactions of Eq. (3) are frozen out and the\nlepton asymmetry remains and will be converted to the observed baryon asymmetry of the\nUniverse through sphalerons in the usual way [12]. At the same time, because of the \u03bb5 term\nto be discussed later, there is no corresponding dark-matter asymmetry, and the annihilation\nof \u03b7 0 at a temperature when it becomes nonrelativistic will determine its relic abundance\n[13], as shown in Ref. [10]. The stated goal of having a simple common origin, i.e. Eq. (3),\nfor neutrino mass, dark matter, and baryogenesis has been realized.\nThe next question to consider is this model's experimental consequences. At the electroweak scale, its particle content is identical to that of Ref. [10], except that neutrinos have\nmass here according to Eq. (5), but not there. The scalar sector consists of two doublets:\n(\u03c6+ , \u03c60 ) as in the SM, and the new all-important (\u03b7 + , \u03b7 0 ). Their scalar interactions are given\n4\n\n\fby\nV\n\n1\n1\n= m21 \u03a6\u2020 \u03a6 + m22 \u03b7 \u2020 \u03b7 + \u03bb1 (\u03a6\u2020 \u03a6)2 + \u03bb2 (\u03b7 \u2020 \u03b7)2 + \u03bb3 (\u03a6\u2020 \u03a6)(\u03b7 \u2020 \u03b7)\n2\n2\n1\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020 2\n+ \u03bb4 (\u03a6 \u03b7)(\u03b7 \u03a6) + \u03bb5 [(\u03a6 \u03b7) + H.c.],\n2\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03bb5 has been chosen real without any loss of generality. For m21 < 0 and m22 > 0, only\n\u03c60 acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value v. The masses of the resulting physical\nscalar bosons are given by\nm2 (\u03c60R ) = 2\u03bb1 v 2 ,\n\n(7)\n\nm2 (\u03b7 \u00b1 ) = m22 + \u03bb3 v 2 ,\n\n(8)\n\nm2 (\u03b7R0 ) = m22 + (\u03bb3 + \u03bb4 + \u03bb5 )v 2 ,\n\n(9)\n\nm2 (\u03b7I0 ) = m22 + (\u03bb3 + \u03bb4 \u2212 \u03bb5 )v 2 .\n\n(10)\n\nSince \u03b7 \u00b1 cannot be dark matter, \u03bb4 \u00b1 \u03bb5 < 0 is required. If \u03bb5 < 0 is also chosen, then \u03b7R0 is\nlighter than \u03b7I0 , and becomes the dark-matter candidate of this model.\nThe \u03b7 particles can be produced in pairs directly by the SM gauge bosons W \u00b1 , Z, or \u03b3.\n0\nand a virtual W \u00b1 , which becomes a quark-antiquark\nOnce produced, \u03b7 \u00b1 will decay into \u03b7R,I\n\nor lepton-antilepton pair, and \u03b7I0 will decay into \u03b7R0 and a virtual Z 0 . The decay chain\n\u03b7 + \u2192 \u03b7I0 l+ \u03bd,\n\nthen \u03b7I0 \u2192 \u03b7R0 l+ l\u2212\n\n(11)\n\nhas 3 charged leptons and large missing energy, and can be compared to the direct decay\n\u03b7 + \u2192 \u03b7R0 l+ \u03bd\n\n(12)\n\nto extract the masses of the respective particles.\nThe direct detection of \u03b7R0 in present dark-matter search experiments is discussed in\nRef. [10], where it is found to be about two orders of magnitude below current experimental\n5\n\n\fcapabilities. The additional contribution from Eq. (3) is negligible because \u03b7R0 interacts\ndirectly only with neutrinos, and Ni are assumed very heavy. Contribution to the one-loop\nradiative process \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 is also negligible, in contrast to the case where Ni play the role of\ndark matter [9].\nTo conclude, it has been pointed out in this note that neutrino mass, dark matter, and\nbaryogenesis may have a simple common origin, i.e. Eq. (3). The proposed model [7] uses the\nresult of Ref. [10] that \u03b7R0 is a suitable bosonic dark-matter candidate, and that of canonical\nleptogenesis [4]. It predicts rather small cross sections for \u03b7R0 detection at low energies,\nalthough future experiments will become sensitive to it. The decays of \u03b7 \u00b1 and \u03b7I0 into \u03b7R0\nshould be observable at the forthcoming Large Hadron Collider (LHC).\nI thank M. Frigerio, T. Hambye, and J. Kubo for useful discussions.
