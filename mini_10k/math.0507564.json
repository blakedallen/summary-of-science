In this paper we construct a family of symplectic 4\u2013manifolds\nwith positive signature for any given fundamental group G that approaches the BMY line. The family is used to show that one cannot\nhope to do better than than the BMY inequality in finding a lower\nbound for the function f = \u03c7 + b\u03c3 on the class of all minimal symplectic\n4-manifolds with a given fundamental group.\n\n1. Introduction\nLet \u03c7(S) and \u03c3(S) denote the Euler characteristic and signature of a 4manifold respectively. Minimal complex surfaces S of general type satisfy\nc21 (S) > 0, \u03c7(S) > 0 and\n2\u03c7h (S) \u2212 6 \u2264 c21 (S) \u2264 9\u03c7h (S)\nwhere c21 (S) = 2\u03c7(S) + 3\u03c3(S) and \u03c7h (S) = 14 (\u03c7(S) + \u03c3(S)). The second\ninequality is usually referred to as the Bogomolov-Miyaoka-Yau inequality.\nFinding symplectic (or K\u00e4hler) 4-manifolds on or near the BMY line has a\nlong and interesting history (c.f. [8], [2], [3], [9], [5], [10], [11]). In particular\nthis means looking for symplectic 4-manifolds with positive signature.\nAll known examples of symplectic 4\u2013manifolds on the BMY line have large\nfundamental groups. In fact, if S is a complex surface differing from CP2\n(the only known simply-connected example on the BMY line), the equality\nc21 (S) = 9\u03c7h (S) holds if and only if the unit disk D 4 = {(z1 , z2 ) \u2208 C2 | |z1 |2 +\n|z2 |2 \u2264 1} covers S [6], [13], [7]. This implies for such S that |\u03c01 (S)| = \u221e.\nThe goal has generally been to produce examples that fill in the geography\nwith respect to (c21 , \u03c7h ). In this paper we are interested what can be said\nfor a given fundamental group.\nStipsicz constructed simply connected symplectic 4\u2013manifolds Cn for which\nc21 (Cn )/\u03c7h (Cn ) \u2192 9 as n \u2192 \u221e in [11]. Our main theorem generalizes this\nresult to any fundamental group.\nTheorem 1. Let G have a presentation with g generators x1 , * * * , xg and\nr relations w1 , * * * , wr . For each integer n > 1, there exists a symplectic\nThe first author gratefully acknowledges support from the NSF grant DMS-0507857.\nThe second author gratefully acknowledges support from the NSF grant DMS-0202148.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nSCOTT BALDRIDGE AND PAUL KIRK\n\n4\u2013manifold M (G, n) with fundamental group G with Euler characteristic\n\u03c7(M (G, n)) = 75n2 + 256n + 130 + 12(g + r + 1),\nand signature\n\u03c3(M (G, n)) = 25n2 \u2212 68n \u2212 78 \u2212 8(g + r + 1).\nOur interest in this question developed while investigating pairs (a, b) \u2208\nR2 for which the function f = a\u03c7 + b\u03c3 has a lower bound on the class\nof symplectic manifolds with a given fundamental group (see [1]). In that\narticle we considered the following.\nFix a finitely presented group G and let M denote either the class M(G)\nof closed symplectic 4-manifolds with fundamental group G or the class\nMmin (G) of minimal, closed symplectic 4-manifolds with fundamental group\nG.\nFor b \u2208 R, define fM(b) \u2208 R \u222a {\u2212\u221e} to be the infimum\nfM(b) = inf {\u03c7(M ) + b\u03c3(M )}.\nM \u2208M\n\n(In [1] we considered the infimum fM(a, b) of a\u03c7 + b\u03c3 on M and showed that\nif a \u2264 0 the infimum is \u2212\u221e. Thus we restrict to fM(1, b), which we more\ncompactly denote by fM(b) in the present article.)\nWe showed in [1] that the set\nDM = {b |fM(b) 6= \u2212\u221e}\n(the domain of fM) is an interval satisfying\n[\u22121, 1] \u2282 DM(G) \u2282 (\u2212\u221e, 1] and [\u22121, 32 ] \u2282 DMmin (G) \u2282 (\u2212\u221e, 32 ].\nThe upper bounds are sharp; in fact 1 \u2208 DM(G) and 23 \u2208 DMmin (G) .\nWe are interested in the value of the left endpoint eG of DM(G) , which is\nan intriguing invariant of a group G. (It may or may not be contained in\nDM(G) .) Since eG \u2264 \u22121, a straightforward argument shows that eG is also\nthe left endpoint of DMmin (G) .\nIn [1] we observed that the results of Stipcitz gives a better lower bound\n(than \u2212\u221e) when G is the trivial group, and so a consequence of the result\nof this article is an extension to all G. In fact Theorem 1 easily implies the\nfollowing corollary.\nCorollary 2. For any finitely presented group G,\nDM(G) \u2282 [\u22123, 1] and DMmin (G) \u2282 [\u22123, 32 ].\n\u0003\nc21\n\n\u2264 9\u03c7h is equivalent to fMmin (G) (\u22123) \u2265 0 proThe BMY inequality\nvided G is not a surface group. Hence the BMY conjecture and Corollary\n2 together imply that eG = 3. Thus, a weaker form of the BMY conjecture\ncould be stated as follows.\nConjecture 3 (Weak BMY Conjecture). For each finitely presented group\nG, eG = \u22123.\n\n\fSYMPLECTIC 4-MANIFOLDS NEAR THE BMY LINE\n\n3\n\n2. The construction\nWe use the following notation. If X and Y are symplectic 4-manifolds\ncontaining symplectic surfaces FX \u2282 X and FY \u2282 Y such that FX2 +FY2 = 0,\nthen the symplectic sum ([4]) of X and Y along FX and FY will be denoted\nby\nX#FX ,FY Y.\nRecall that topologically X#FX ,FY Y is obtained by removing tubular neighborhoods of FX and FY and identifying the resulting boundaries in a fiberpreserving way. Moreover, if EX \u2282 X (resp. EY \u2282 Y ) is a symplectic\nsurface intersecting FX once transversally (resp. intersecting FY transversally), then the fiber sum can be constructed so that (the connected sum)\nEX #EY is a symplectic surface in X#FX ,FY Y .\n2.1. The first piece: symplectic manifolds with given fundamental\ngroup. The following theorem was proven in [1].\nTheorem 4. Let G have a presentation with g generators x1 , * * * , xg and\nr relations w1 , * * * , wr . Then there exists a minimal symplectic 4-manifold\nM (G) with \u03c01 (M (G)) \u223c\n= G, Euler characteristic \u03c7(M (G)) = 12(g + r + 1),\nand signature \u03c3(M (G)) = \u22128(g + r + 1).\nWe will use the following observation. The manifold M (G) constructed\nin Theorem 4 is obtained by taking fiber sums of a certain base manifold\nwith g + r + 1 copies of the basic elliptic surface E(1). Since E(1) admits\na singular fibration with symplectic generic fibers and 6 cusp fibers (which\nare simply connected), so does E(1) \u2212 F , where F denotes the generic fiber\nin E(1) along which the fiber sum giving M is constructed. Thus each\nM (G) contains a symplectic torus T0 such that the induced homomorphism\n\u03c01 (T0 ) \u2192 \u03c01 (M (G)) is trivial.\n2.2. The second piece: symplectic manifolds near the BMY line.\nIn [11], Stipsicz proved the following theorem.\nProposition 5 (Stipsicz). For each non-negative integer n, there exists a\nsymplectic 4\u2013manifold X(n) which admits a genus-(15n+1) Lefschetz fibration with a section Tn+2 of genus (n+2) and self-intersection \u2212(n+1). Furthermore, X(n) can be equipped with a symplectic structure such that Tn+2\nis a symplectic submanifold. The projection map X(n) \u2192 Tn+2 induces an\nisomorphism on fundamental groups. The Euler characteristic of X(n) is\n\u03c7(X(n)) = 75n2 + 180n + 12 and the signature is \u03c3(X(n)) = 25n2 \u2212 60n \u2212 8.\nDenote by F15n+1 \u2282 X(n) a fixed generic fiber of X(n). This is a symplectic surface with trivial normal bundle.\n2.3. The third piece: a simply connected manifold. Gompf constructs\na symplectic 4-manifold S1,1 in [4, Lemma 5.5] which contains a disjoint pair\nT, F of symplectically embedded surfaces T of genus one and F of genus two,\n\n\f4\n\nSCOTT BALDRIDGE AND PAUL KIRK\n\nwith trivial normal bundles such that S1,1 \u2212 (T \u222a F ) is simply connected.\nThus the symplectic sum A of two copies S1,1 along the genus two surfaces\nA = S1,1 #F,F S1,1\ncontains a pair of disjointly embedded symplectic tori T1 \u222aT2 \u2282 A with trivial\nnormal bundles so that the complement A \u2212 (T1 \u222a T2 ) is simply connected.\nSince S1,1 has Euler characteristic 23 and signature \u221215, \u03c7(A) = 50 and\n\u03c3(A) = \u221230.\nThe manifold A has a useful property, whose proof is a simple application\nof the Seifert-Van Kampen theorem.\nProposition 6. Suppose B and C are symplectic 4-manifolds containing\nsymplectic tori iB : TB \u2282 B and iC : TC \u2282 C with trivial normal bundles.\nLet D = B#TB ,T1 A#T2 ,TC C be the fiber sum of B, A, and C. Then\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03c01 (D) = \u03c01 (B)/N ((iB )\u2217 (\u03c01 (TB )) \u22c6 \u03c01 (C)/N ((iC )\u2217 (\u03c01 (TC )\nwhere \u22c6 denotes free product and N (H) denotes the normal closure of a\nsubgroup H.\n\u0003\n2.4. The fourth piece: \"Elbows\". Let T be a torus and {a, b} a pair of\nsmoothly embedded loops forming a symplectic basis of \u03c01 T . Let \u03c6 : T \u2192 T\nbe the Dehn twist around a. The mapping torus Y\u03c6 fibers over S 1 with fiber\nT . Let t1 : S 1 \u2192 Y\u03c6 denote a section. Taking a product of Y\u03c6 with S 1\nyields a symplectic 4-manifold Y\u03c6 \u00d7 S 1 (this is just Thurston's manifold\nfrom [12]) which fibers over a torus with symplectic torus fibers. Moreover,\nthe symplectic structure can be chosen so that the section t1 \u00d7id : S 1 \u00d7S 1 \u2192\nY\u03c6 \u00d7 S 1 is symplectic. Denote by s1 : S 1 \u2192 {p} \u00d7 S 1 \u2282 Y\u03c6 \u00d7 S 1 the loop\nrepresenting the second factor.\nNote that Y\u03c6 \u00d7 S 1 contains a torus T \u2032 = b \u00d7 s1 , where b is the curve\ndescribed above in the fiber of Y\u03c6 . The torus T \u2032 is homologically non-trivial\nby the Kunneth theorem, since b is non-trivial in H1 (Y\u03c6 ), and is Lagrangian\nwith respect to the symplectic structure on Y\u03c6 \u00d7 S 1 . Thus the symplectic\nstructure on Y\u03c6 \u00d7 S 1 can be perturbed slightly to make T \u2032 symplectic. Note\nmoreover that T \u2032 is disjoint from the section t1 \u00d7s1 : S 1 \u00d7S 1 \u2192 Y\u03c6 \u00d7S 1 since\nwe can assume that t1 intersects the fiber containing b in a point which does\nnot lie on b. The tubular neighborhood of T \u2032 in Y\u03c6 \u00d7 S 1 is trivial since b can\nisotoped off itself in a fiber of Y\u03c6 \u2192 S 1 . Similarly the tubular neighborhood\nof the section t1 \u00d7 s1 is trivial since t1 can be pushed off itself in Y\u03c6 .\nDefine Elb(n) to be the fiber sum Elb(n) = (Y\u03c6 \u00d7 S 1 )#T,T 2 (T 2 \u00d7 \u03a3n\u22121 ).\nThe fiber sum can be carried out so that the sections of Y\u03c6 \u00d7 S 1 \u2192 S 1 \u00d7 S 1\nand T 2 \u00d7 \u03a3n\u22121 \u2192 \u03a3n\u22121 yield a symplectic section of the resulting fibration\nElb(n) \u2192 \u03a3n . Thus Elb(n) contains a disjoint pair of symplectic surfaces\nwith trivial normal bundles, a torus T \u2032 = b \u00d7 s1 and a genus n surface, the\nimage of the section, which we denote by Dn .\n\n\fSYMPLECTIC 4-MANIFOLDS NEAR THE BMY LINE\n\n5\n\nLetting t2 , s2 , * * * , tn , sn denote the generators of \u03c01 (\u03a3n\u22121 ), one computes\n\u03c01 (Elb(n)) = ha, b, t1 , s1 , . . . , tn , sn | a central , [b, t1 ] = a,\n[b, ti ] = 1 for i > 1, [b, si ] = 1 for all i,\nQ\nn\ni=1 [ti , si ] = 1i.\nThe inclusion of T \u2032 into Elb(n) takes the generators of \u03c01 T \u2032 to b and s1 ,\nand the inclusion of Dn takes the standard basis to t1 , s1 , * * * , tn , sn . The\nEuler characteristic and signature of Elb(n) both vanish.\nThe manifold Elb(n) \u2212 Dn is a punctured torus fibration over \u03a3n , and\nhence has a presentation with the same generators and all the same relations\nexcept that one no longer has a commuting with b. i.e. a commutes with\nall generators except b.\n2.5. The fifth piece: an elliptic surface. We find a symplectically embedded surface J of genus n + 3 and self-intersection n + 1 in the elliptic\nsurface E(n + 5) such that E(n + 5) \u2212 J is simply connected as follows.\nConsider n + 3 copies of the generic fiber and one copy of the section in a fibration E(n+5) \u2192 CP1 with 6(n+5) cusp fibers. The section and fibers are\nsymplectic with regards to the symplectic structure on the elliptic fibration\nE(n + 5). Resolve the n + 3 transverse double points ([4]) to get a symplectically embedded surface J of genus n + 3 and self-intersection n + 1 (the\nfiber hits the section once and that section has self-intersection \u2212(n + 5)).\nThe complement E(n + 5) \u2212 J is simply connected because E(n + 5) has a\nsimply connected fiber which intersects J in one point: the normal circle of\na tubular neighborhood of J is nullhomotopic in E(n + 5) \u2212 J.\n2.6. Putting the pieces together. We begin by a modification of Stipcizs's construction. Let Z(n) be the fiber sum of Elb(15n + 1) and X(n)\nalong D15n+1 \u2282 Elb(15n + 1) and the fiber F15n+1 of the Lefschetz fibration\nX(n) \u2192 \u03a3n+2\nZ(n) = Elb(15n + 1)#D15n+1 ,F15n+1 X(n).\nThe fiber sum can be constructed so that the fiber T \u2282 Elb(15n + 1) and\nthe section Tn+2 \u2282 X(n) add to yield a symplectic surface of genus n + 3,\nKn+3 = T #Tn+2 \u2282 Z(n) [4]. The important property of Z(n) is that it\ncontains a symplectic torus T \u2032 , since D15n+1 and T \u2032 are disjoint.\nThe fundamental group of Z(n) is easily computed, since Elb(15n + 1) \u2212\nD15n+1 is a fiber bundle with punctured torus fibers and X(n) \u2212 F15n+1\nis a Lefschetz fibration over a punctured genus n + 2 surface with at least\none simply connected fiber. Using the Seifert-Van Kampen theorem and\nNovikov additivity one obtains the following.\nLemma 7. The fundamental group of Z(n) is the free product of Z with\ngenerator b, and a genus n + 2 surface group generated by xi , yi :\nY\n\u03c01 (Z(n)) = Zb \u22c6 hxi , yi , i = 1, * * * , n + 2| [xi , yi ] = 1i.\n\n\f6\n\nSCOTT BALDRIDGE AND PAUL KIRK\n\nMoreover, Z(n) contains a disjoint pair of symplectic surfaces, T \u2032 \u222aKn+3 \u2282\nZ(n) satisfying [T \u2032 ]2 = 0, and [Kn+3 ]2 = \u2212n \u2212 1.

We take\nsymplectic sum of this manifold with A to obtain an example with a torus\nwhose complement is simply connected.\nDefine W (n) to be the symplectic sum\nW (n) = A#T1 ,T \u2032 Z(n)#Kn+3 ,J E(n + 5).\nThen since \u03c01 (A \u2212 (T2 \u222a T2 )) = 1, the following proposition follows straightforwardly.\nProposition 8. The symplectic manifold W (n) is simply connected and\ncontains a symplectic torus T2 \u2282 W (n) with trivial normal bundle so that\n\u03c01 (W (n)\u2212 T2 ) = 1. It has Euler characterstic \u03c7(W (n)) = 75n2 + 256n + 130\nand signature \u03c3(W (n)) = 25n2 \u2212 68n \u2212 78.\n\u0003\nWe can now prove Theorem 1.\nProof of Theorem 1.
