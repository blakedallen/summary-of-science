Introduction\nBlue Straggler Stars (BSSs) are objects that, in the colormagnitude diagram (CMD) of evolved stellar populations, lie\nalong an extension of the Main Sequence (MS), in a region\nwhich is brighter and bluer than the Turn-off (TO). First discovered by Sandage (1953) in M3, they have been observed in\nall Galactic globular clusters (GCs; Piotto et al. 2004), in the\nfield population (Carney et al. 2005), and in dwarf galaxies of\nthe local group (Momany et al. 2007).\nTheir location in the CMD suggests that BSSs have masses\nof 1.2 \u00f7 1.5 M , significantly larger than those of normal stars in\nold stellar systems (like GCs). Thus, they are thought to have increased their mass during their evolution. Two mechanisms have\nbeen proposed for their formation: i) the merger of two stars induced by stellar collision (COL-BSSs; Hills & Day 1976) and\nii) coalescence or mass-transfer between two companions in a\nbinary system (MT-BSSs; McCrea 1964). The two formation\nchannels are thought to act with different efficiencies according to the cluster structural parameters (Fusi Pecci et al. 1992)\nand they can work simultaneously within the same cluster in different radial regions, corresponding to widely different stellar\ndensities (Ferraro et al. 1997; Mapelli et al. 2006). Indeed, collisions are more frequent in the central region of GCs, because\nof the high stellar density, while MT-BSSs mainly populate the\nSend offprint requests to: A. Sollima\n?\nBased on ACS observations collected with the Hubble Space\nTelescope within the observing program GO 10775.\n\ncluster periphery, where binary systems can more easily evolve\nin isolation without suffering exchange or ionization due to gravitational encounters. The whole scenario is further complicated\nby the cluster dynamical evolution that leads massive systems\n(like binaries and BSSs) to sink toward the cluster center in a\ntime-scale comparable to the cluster relaxation time.\nA possible tool for distinguishing COL-BSSs from MTBSSs is based on high-resolution spectroscopic analysis. In fact,\nanomalous chemical abundances are expected at the surface of\nBSSs resulting from mass-transfer activity (Sarna & de Greve\n1996), while they are not predicted for COL-BSSs (Lombardi\net al. 1995). However, such studies have just become feasible\nand they are limited to only a small number of BSSs in just one\ncluster (47 Tucanae; Ferraro et al. 2006).\nAs an alternative way for getting insights on the relative efficiency of the two formation mechanisms, here we investigate\npossible correlations between the BSS population and the host\ncluster properties.\n\n2. Observations and Data Reduction\nThe photometric database considered here is the same used in\nSollima et al. (2007; hereafter S07) for measuring the frequency\nof binary systems in the core of thirteen low-density Galactic\nGCs. It consists of a set of high-resolution images, obtained with\nthe ACS on board HST, through the F606W (V606 ) and F814W\n(I814 ) filters. As described in S07, the target clusters are characterized by high Galactic latitude (b > 15\u25e6 ), low reddening\n\n\f2\n\nPlease give a shorter version with: \\authorrunning and/or \\titilerunning prior to \\maketitle\n\n(E(B \u2212 V) < 0.1) and low projected central density (log \u03c100 < 5,\nwhere \u03c100 is in units of M arcmin\u22122 ). These selection criteria have been chosen in order to limit the effects of field contamination, differential reddening and crowding on the determination of the binary fractions. The selected target clusters and\ntheir main physical parameters are listed in Table 1. The central\nluminosity density \u03c10 and the absolute V band magnitude MV\nare from Djorgovski (1993), the age t9 is from Salaris & Weiss\n(2002)1 , and the projected central velocity dispersion \u03c3v is from\nMcLaughlin & Van der Marel (2005). A detailed description of\nthe data reduction and calibration procedure can be found in S07\ntogether with the resulting CMDs for all the target clusters.\nAs discussed in S07, the binary sequence is well defined and\ndistinguishable from the MS and the fraction of binary systems\n(\u03bebin ) found within the cluster core radius ranges from about 10\nto 50% (the value of \u03bebin are listed in Table 1). Moreover, a number of BSSs populating the bright part of the CMD is also evident in the data sample. In the following section we describe the\nadopted procedure to derive the BSS frequencies in the core of\nthe target clusters.\n\n3. BSS population selection\nOur primary criterion for the definition of the BSS sample is\nbased on the location of stars in the (I814 , V606 \u2212 I814 ) CMD.\nSince the considered GCs have different distances, reddening,\nages and metallicities, in order to define a homogeneous criterion\nfor the BSS selection, we shifted in magnitude and color the\nCMD of each cluster to match that of M55 (see also Ferraro\net al. 1995). For minimizing the contamination from sub-giant\nbranch, horizontal branch (HB) and field stars, we limited the\nanalysis to colors bluer than (V606 \u2212 I814 ) < 0.47 and magnitudes\nin the range 15.1 < I814 < 18.1. The adopted BSS selection box\n(the same for all clusters) is shown in Figure 1 and the number of\nselected BSSs (NBSS ) in each target cluster is reported in Table\n1.\nIn order to compare the frequency of BSSs in different GCs,\nthe size of the total cluster population must be taken into consideration. Commonly, the number of BSSs is normalized to\nthe number of stars belonging to a given evolutive sequence\n(usually the HB, or the Red Giant Branch, RGB; Ferraro et al.\n1995; Piotto et al. 2004; Leigh et al. 2007). Unfortunately, in\nsome clusters of our sample the number of HB and RGB stars\nis very small, which would make the derived BSS frequency\nhighly uncertain. We therefore normalized the number of selected BSSs, to the number of MS stars (NMS ) in the magnitude range 18.1 < I814 < 19.1 and with colors comprised within\n\u2206(V606 \u2212 I814 ) < 0.05 from the cluster MS mean ridge line. Stars\nin this magnitude range are bright enough to have the same completeness level of BSSs (\u03c6 > 95%) and cover a similar mass\nrange in all clusters: following the theoretical stellar isochrones\nby Cariulo et al. (2004) and taking into account the differences\nin age and metallicities among the selected GCs, the TO mass\nvaries between 0.8 M < M < 0.9 M . Hence, we considered\nN MS a good indicator of the size of the sampled cluster population.\nThe possible effect of background and foreground field star\ncontamination on the BSS and MS selections has been estimated\nby using the Galaxy model of Robin et al. (2003). For this purpose a synthetic catalog covering an area of 0.5 square degree\n1\n\nSince NGC 6981 is not included in the list of Salaris & Weiss\n(2002), we converted the ages measured by De Angeli et al. (2005) into\nthe Salaris & Weiss (2002) scale.\n\nTable 1.

(2005). The number of contaminating\nfield stars turns out to be neglegible (<2) in all the clusters of our\nsample. Then, we counted the number of field stars included in\nMS\nthe BSS and MS selection boxes (N BSS\nf ield and N f ield , respectively),\nand we computed the BSS specific frequency as:\nF=\n\nNBSS \u2212 N BSS\nf ield\nNMS \u2212 N MS\nf ield\n\n(1)\n\nThe resulting values for the thirteen target clusters are listed\nin Table 1. In order to check the suitability of the adopted normalization criterion, we compared the derived BSS specific frequencies with those measured by Leigh et al. (2007, and uptdated by Sills 2008, private communication) for the four clusters\nin common with our sample (namely, NGC 4590, NGC 6362,\nNGC 6723 and NGC 6981). These authors normalized the number of BSSs in the cluster cores to that of red giant branch stars\nin the same magnitude range. In spite of the different normalization criterion, the specific frequencies calculated for the four\nclusters in common correlate very well (with a correlation coefficient r = 0.92).\n\n4. Correlations between BSS specific frequency\nand cluster parameters\nWith the aim of shading light on the BSS formation mechanisms,\nwe correlated the BSS specific frequency (F) calculated above\nwith the core binary fraction (\u03bebin ) obtained by S07 and with\nvarious other physical parameters of the thirteen GCs of the sample. In particular, we searched for possible correlations with the\ncluster central density, total magnitude, age, and central velocity\ndispersion (see Table 1), as well as with the stellar collision rate\n(defined as \u0393 \u2261 \u03c120 rc3 /\u03c3v ; Pooley & Hut 2006), the global metallicity ([M/H], from Ferraro et al. 19992 ), the cluster evaporation\nrate (\u03bd, from Gnedin & Ostriker 1997), concentration (c, from\n2\nFor NGC 6101, NGC 6362, NGC 6723 and Palomar 12 not included in the list of Ferraro et al.

(1999).\n\n\fPlease give a shorter version with: \\authorrunning and/or \\titilerunning prior to \\maketitle\n\n3\n\nand we calculated the quantity\nBIC = log L p \u2212\n\np\nlog N,\n2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere L p is the likelihood and N is the dimension of the sample\n(N = 13 in our case). The likelihood is calculated as log L p =\nPN\nj=1 log P p, j , where\n\nP p, j =\n\nFig. 1. (I814 , V606 \u2212 I814 ) CMD of M55. The adopted selection\nboxes for the BSS and MS populations are shown. The fiducial\nBSSs are marked with open circles.\nTrager et al. 1995), half-mass relaxation time (trh ) and half-mass\nradius (rh , from Djorgovski 1993).\nThe Pearson's linear correlation coefficients and confidence\nlevels for the considered parameter pairs are listed in Table 2.\nThe strongest correlation is found between the BSS specific frequency and the binary fraction. A noticeable correlation with the\nabsolute magnitude and anticorrelations with the cluster age and\ncentral velocity dispersion are also apparent. Considering that\nthe age estimates are quite uncertain and span a narrow range\nof values in our sample, any firm conclusion about the possible\ndependence of F on the cluster age is premature at the moment.\nHowever, if confirmed, such an anticorrelation might be a consequence of the analogous anticorrelation between binary fraction\nand age already discussed by S07, and would suggest that binary\ndisruption processes in the core of GCs become more efficient\nwith time, thus reducing the fraction of both binaries and BSS\nin the core of the oldest clusters (as suggested by Ivanova et al.\n2005, but at odds with Hurley et al. 2007). In any case, even if\nthe anticorrelation between F (or \u03bebin ) and t9 is not confirmed,\nthe correlation between the BSS specific frequency and the binary fraction still holds. The latter is shown in the upper panel\nof Figure 2 and it suggests that the main formation channel of\nBSS in these clusters is the unperturbed evolution of primordial\nbinary systems.\nWe stress that, since the considered parameters do not constitute an orthonormal basis, most of the less significant correlations could be artificially induced by primary correlations\namong other parameters. In order to investigate the possible dependence of F on more than one cluster parameter, we applied\nthe Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) test (Schwarz 1978)\nto our dataset. We assumed the BSS specific frequency F to be a\nlinear combination of a sub-sample of p parameters (\u03bbi ) selected\namong those listed above:\nF pf it =\n\np\nX\ni=1\n\n\u03b1i \u03bbi + \u03b1 p+1\n\n(2)\n\ne\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nf it 2\n\u2212 F j \u2212F\np, j\n2\u03c32\nF\n\n\u221a\n\u03c3F 2\u03c0\n\n(4)\n\nwith F j being the BSS fraction of cluster j, and \u03c3F being the\nresidual of the fit. The p parameters that maximize the quantity\nBIC are the most probable correlators with F. For our dataset\nthe maximum value of BIC is obtained with p = 2, \u03bb1 = \u03bebin\nand \u03bb2 = \u03c3v . The correlation between F, \u03bebin and \u03c3v is shown in\nFigure 2, together with the best fit line. All the other 3-variate or\nhigher-order correlations turn out to be non-significant.\nA note of caution is worth: as can be seen, these correlations are essentially due to the four clusters (namely Terzan 7,\nPalomar 12, Arp 2 and NGC 6981) with the largest (> 20%) binary fraction, while the other GCs in our sample define a group\nwith an average binary content \u03bebin \u223c 10% and a BSS frequency\nF \u223c 1.2%. In particular, all the correlations that we have found\nare mainly driven by Terzan 7, Palomar 12 and Arp 2, which are\nthe GCs not only with the largest binary and BSS fractions, but\nalso with the lowest absolute magnitudes and the lowest ages.\nThese three clusters are also the most distant from the Sun and\nthey are thought to belong to the Sagittarius Stream (Bellazzini\net. al 2003). Thus, they might be stellar systems with intrinsically different origins and properties, and the correlations found\nhere might not be appropriate for the overall class of \"genuine\"\nGalactic GCs (GGCs). By excluding these three clusters from\nthe sample, the anticorrelation with the total luminosity still\nholds (even if with lower significance), in agreement with what\nalready found by Piotto et al. (2004), Sandquist (2005) and Leigh\net al. (2007) for larger samples of GCs with different characteristics, and for BSS populations selected and normalized with\ndifferent criteria. Instead, the anticorrelation with the age disappears, thus bringing our results in agreement with those of Leigh\net al. (2007; see also De Marchi et al. 2006). The correlation\nbetween the BSS and the binary fractions also disappears excluding the three \"Sagittarius\" clusters (SgrGCs), with the range\nin \u03bebin spanned by the remaining sample being very small. Note\nhowever that both the average BSS and binary frequencies are\nhigher in SgrGCs (hFBSS i = 2.7% and h\u03bebin i = 41.5%) than\nin GGCs (hFBSS i = 1.3% and h\u03bebin i = 14%). Thus, even assuming that SgrGCs were born with different initial conditions\nfrom GGCs, the observational facts presented here allow to draw\n(at least) the \"conservative\" conclusion that binary-rich enviroments tend to produce more BSS in the low-density cluster\nregime (where collisions are expected to play a minor role in the\nformation/destruction of binaries).\n\n5. Conclusions\nWe measured the BSS specific frequency in the core of thirteen\nlow-density Galactic GCs and investigated its correlation with\ndifferent dynamical and general cluster parameters. We found\nevidences that, at least in this density regime, binary-rich environments are more efficient in producing BSS. No correlations\nhave been found with the cluster central density, concentration,\n\n\f4\n\nPlease give a shorter version with: \\authorrunning and/or \\titilerunning prior to \\maketitle\n\nTable 2.

A larger fraction of BSSs formed by the evolution of\nprimordial binaries is therefore expected in lower velocity dispersion GCs (see also Davies et al. 2004). Such an effect of \u03c3v\n(in terms of both hardening and shrinking the binary systems)\nmight be, in turn, at the origin of the inverse correlation between\nthe BSS frequency and the cluster total luminosity (mass) observed in open clusters (De Marchi et al. 2006), low density\nGCs (Sandquist 2005), as well as high density GCs (Piotto et\nal. 2004; Leigh et al. 2007). Indeed, the more massive GCs have\nlarger central velocity dispersions (as a consequence of the virial\ntheorem for systems with similar radii, as GCs; see Fig. 1 of\nDjorgovski 1995). For most of these clusters, however, the binary fraction is still unknown and the trivariate correlation between F, \u03bebin and \u03c3v cannot be derived. If its significance and\nits interpretation in terms of the velocity dispersion effect is confirmed also in high-density clusters, then stellar collisions might\nplay a secondary role in the production of BSSs, and the evolution of primordial binaries should always be the dominant process. For the moment, however, these conclusions remain speculative, since the sample of GCs analyzed here, in spite of being the largest to date with known binary fraction, is still too\nsmall for statistically reliable assessments. Enlarging the sample\nof GCs with known binary and BSS fraction is therefore essential and urgent to verify the findings presented in this paper on a\nmore robust statistical basis.\nAcknowledgements.
