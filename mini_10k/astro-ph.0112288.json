Understanding the structure and dynamics of\nbarred (SB) galaxies is, therefore, an issue of some importance. The principal dynamical quantity for SB galaxies is\nthe rotation frequency/pattern speed of the bar, \u03a9p . This\nis usually parametrized by the distance-independent ratio\nR \u2261 DL /aB , where aB is the semi-major axis of the bar\nand DL is the radius to the Lagrangian point, where the\ngravitational and centrifugal forces cancel out in the bar's\nrest frame. (The Lagrangian radius is therefore the generalization to strong bars of the corotation radius.) Contopoulos\n(1980) argued that a self-consistent bar is possible only if\nR \u2265 1. A bar is termed fast when 1.0 \u2264 R <\n\u223c 1.4, while, for\na larger value of R, a bar is said to be slow.\nA variety of methods have been used to attempt measurent of bar pattern speeds (see, for example, the review of\n\u22c6 Based on observations made with the Italian Telescopio\nNazionale Galileo (AOT-3, 3-06-119) operated on the island of La\nPalma by the Centro Galileo Galilei of the Consorzio Nazionale\nper l'Astronomia e l'Astrofisica, and the Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope operated by the Isaac Newton group at La Palma island\nat the Spanish Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos of the\nInstituto de Astrofisica de Canarias.\n\u2020 email: debattis@astro.unibas.ch\nc 0000 RAS\n\nElmegreen 1996). Most measurements of R rely on hydrodynamical simulations. These usually try to match the gas flow\nin the region of the bar, particularly at the shocks, which\nworks because the location of the shocks depends on R, moving further ahead of the bar as R increases. A bar needs to\nbe fast for the shocks to remain curved with their concave\nsides towards the bar major axis, as is usually observed (van\nAlbada & Sanders 1982; Athanassoula 1992). Detailed simulations of gas flows in individual galaxies also result in fast\nbars; examples include: NGC 1365 (R = 1.3, Lindblad et al.\n1996), NGC 1300 (R = 1.3, Lindblad & Kristen 1996), and\nNGC 4123 (R = 1.2, Weiner et al. 2001). Hydrodynamical\nsimulations can also recover R by matching morphological\nfeatures in H I; some examples are: NGC 7479 (R = 1.22,\nLaine 1996), NGC 1073 (R = 1 \u2212 1.2, England et al. 1990),\nNGC 3992 (R = 1, Hunter et al. 1989), and NGC 5850\n(R = 1.35, Aguerri et al. 2001).\nA direct method for measuring \u03a9p , using a tracer population which satisfies continuity, was developed by Tremaine\n& Weinberg (1984). Since gas is subject to phase changes, it\nis not well-suited for this application. Old stellar populations\nin the absence of significant obscuration, on the other hand,\nare ideal for the Tremaine-Weinberg (TW) method. This has\npermitted application of the method to a small number of\nearly type SB galaxies: NGC 936 (R = 1.4 \u00b1 0.3, Kent 1987\nand Merrifield & Kuijken 1995), NGC 4596 (R = 1.15+0.38\n\u22120.23 ,\nGerssen et al. 1998) and NGC 7079 (R = 0.9 \u00b1 0.15, Debattista & Williams 2001).\nThe observational evidence, therefore, favors fast bars.\n\n\f2\n\nV.P. Debattista, E.M. Corsini and J.A.L. Aguerri\n\nThe perturbation theory calculations of Weinberg (1985)\npredicted that a fast bar would be slowed down rapidly\nin the presence of a massive dark matter (DM) halo. Such\nslow-down has been seen in various simulations (Sellwood\n1980; Little & Carlberg 1991; Hernquist & Weinberg 1992;\nAthanassoula 1996). The fully self-consistent, high resolution N -body simulations of Debattista & Sellwood (1998)\nalso confirmed this prediction; however they showed that,\nfor a maximum disc (here taken to mean a disc which dominates the rotation curve throughout the inner few disc scalelengths, cf. van Albada & Sancisi 1986), a fast bar can survive for a large fraction of a Hubble time. Subsequently,\nTremaine & Ostriker (1999) suggested that bars manage to\nremain fast not because discs are maximal but rather because the inner parts of DM halos are flattened and rapidly\nrotating. However, Debattista & Sellwood (2000) showed\nthat rapid slow-down persists even then unless the halo angular momentum is very large relative to that of the disc.\nThus they concluded that SB galaxies must be maximal,\nand argued that the same must be true for all high surface\nbrightness disc galaxies.\nThis conclusion rests on a small number of pattern\nspeed measurements; in view of the fact that maximum\ndiscs are in conflict with the predictions of cold dark matter (CDM) cosmologies (e.g. Navarro et al. 1997), enlarging\nthe sample of measured pattern speeds is desireable. In this\npaper, we report observations of NGC 1023, for which we\napplied the TW method.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. The TW\nmethod is described briefly in \u00a72. Then, in \u00a73 we give an\noverview of the previously known properties of NGC 1023.\nThe photometric observations, reduction and results, including aB , are presented in \u00a74, while \u00a75 presents the spectroscopic observations and results. We derive the rotation\ncurve, corrected for the asymmetric drift, from which we\nobtain DL . With these results at hand, we then apply the\nTW method in \u00a76. We present our conclusions in \u00a77.\n\n2\n\nTHE TREMAINE-WEINBERG METHOD\n\nThe TW method is contained in the following simple equation:\n\u03a9p sin i =\n\nR\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nh(Y )\n\nR\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nR\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nh(Y )\n\n\u03a3(X, Y ) Vlos (X, Y ) dX dY\n\nR\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u03a3(X, Y ) X dX dY\n\nter, strategy. Noting that the integrals in Eqn. 1 represent\nluminosity-weighted averages, they rewrote Eqn. 1 as:\n\u03a9p sin i(X \u2212 Xc ) = V \u2212 Vsys ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere V and X are the luminosity-weighted averages relative\nto an arbitrary frame, in which the galaxy center is (Xc , Yc )\nand the systemic velocity is Vsys . Plotting V against X then\ngives a straight line with slope \u03a9p sin i. With this approach,\nthe problem of centering errors becomes one of fixing an\narbitrary reference position and velocity frame common to\nall the slits, which in general is much easier to achieve.\n(ii) Small signal-to-noise ratios. V and X measure differences across X = 0 and are, therefore, susceptible to\nnoise. This is particularly true for V, for which the nonaxisymmetric part of Vlos is not much larger than typical\nmeasurement errors. Merrifield & Kuijken (1995) overcame\nthis problem by projecting their slit spectra along the spatial direction thereby increasing the signal-to-noise ratio of\nV significantly. This projection amounts to carrying out the\nrequired velocity integral directly in photon space. The signal in X is typically much better constrained, since bars\ntend to be bright.\n(iii) Sensitivity to errors in the disc's position angle.\nThis was first recognized by Debattista & Williams (2002).\nThey used two-dimensional Fabry-Perot absorption-line\nspectroscopy of NGC 7079 to show that small errors in the\nderived position angle (PA) of the disc translate into large\nerrors in \u03a9p . For example, for NGC 7079, they found that an\nerror of as little as 5\u25e6 in the disc PA would result in an error\nof 100% in \u03a9p . Since the uncertainties in published values of\nPA for disc galaxies are often at the 5\u25e6 level, each application of the TW method requires careful measurement of the\ndisc PA. Highly inclined galaxies and galaxies in which the\nbar is at about 45\u25e6 to the disc major axis, are less sensitive\nto errors in disc PA. We note that past applications of the\nTW method using slits have been to well studied galaxies\n(Merrifield & Kuijken 1995; Gerssen et al. 1998), so that it is\nvery unlikely that large errors of this type were introduced.\nIn this work, we have followed the prescriptions of Merrifield & Kuijken (1995) to deal with the centering and\nsignal-to-noise problems. We dealt with the sensitivity to\nerrors in disc PA by obtaining deep surface photometry of\nNGC 1023 in advance of the spectroscopy.\n\n(1)\n\nwhere i is the inclination of the galaxy, Vlos is the line-ofsight (minus systemic) velocity, \u03a3 is the surface brightness,\nh is an arbitrary weighting function and (X, Y ) are coordinates on the sky, centered on the galaxy, along the disc's\napparent major and minor axes, respectively. Slit observations are equivalent to h(Y ) \u221d \u03b4(Y \u2212 Yslit ). Application of\nEqn. 1 presents three main difficulties:\n(i) Centering errors. As was already recognized by\nTremaine & Weinberg (1984), small errors in identifying either the center or the systemic velocity of the galaxy can significantly affect the value of \u03a9p obtained. Noting that most\nSB galaxies are nearly point-symmetric about their centers,\nTremaine & Weinberg (1984) suggested using a weighting\nfunction which is odd in Y to counter this problem. Merrifield & Kuijken (1995) used a different, and somewhat bet-\n\n3\n\nGLOBAL PROPERTIES OF NGC 1023\n\nNGC 1023 (UGC 2154) is a highly-inclined lenticular galaxy\nclassified as SB0 by Nilson (1973), as SB01 (5) by Sandage\n& Tammann (1981), and as SB0\u2212 (rs) by de Vaucouleurs\net al. (1991, hereafter RC3). Its total B-band magnitude\nis BT = 10.35 (RC3), which, after correcting for inclina0\ntion and extinction, corresponds to MB\n= \u221219.96 for an\nT\nadopted distance of 10.2 Mpc (Faber et al. 1997; H0 = 80\nkm s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ).\nNGC 1023 is the brightest member of the LGG 70\ngroup (Garcia 1993). Its closest companion, designated NGC\n1023A by Hart et al. (1980), is a low luminosity condensation\nlocated near the eastern end of the major axis. The centers of\nthe two objects are separated by an angular distance of 2.\u2032 7\n(RC3), corresponding to a projected linear distance of about\n8 kpc at 10.2 Mpc. The proximity of NGC 1023A to NGC\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fA Fast Bar in the Post-Interaction Galaxy NGC 1023\n1023 led Arp (1966) to include NGC 1023 in the section of\nhis Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies (Plate 135) devoted to E-like\ngalaxies with nearby fragments. NGC 1023A was recognized\nas an individual galaxy by Barbon & Capaccioli (1975) and\nclassified as Magellanic irregular or late-type dwarf galaxy\nby Capaccioli, Lorenz & Afanasiev (1986). High resolution\nradio observations by Sancisi et al. (1984) found a complex\nstructure and kinematics for the neutral hydrogen. Most of\nit was shown to be outside of the galaxy and consists of\ntails and bridges connecting NGC 1023 to three companions, including NGC 1023A. This morphology suggests an\ninteraction with NGC 1023A, a conclusion also reached by\nCapaccioli et al. (1986). Although it is rich in neutral hydrogen, NGC 1023 is undetected in ionized (Pogge & Eskridge\n1993; S\u00e1nchez-Portal et al. 2000) and molecular gas (Sofue\net al. 1993; Taniguchi et al. 1994), making application of the\nTW method to it possible.\nSurface photometry of NGC 1023 has been obtained in\nseveral optical (e.g., Barbon & Capaccioli 1975; Kormendy\n1985; Lauer et al. 1995; S\u00e1nchez-Portal et al. 2000; Bower\net al. 2001) and near-infrared bands (M\u00f6llenhoff & Heidt\n2001). Detailed stellar kinematics have been measured by\nSimien & Prugniel (1997, PA = 87\u25e6 , 177\u25e6 ), Neistein et al.\n(1999, PA = 87\u25e6 ), and recently by Bower et al. (2001,\nPA = 0\u25e6 , 45\u25e6 , 90\u25e6 ), who inferred the presence of a supermassive black hole of 4 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 by three-integral, axisymmetric modelling. Sil'chenko (1999) observed the circumnuclear\nregion of NGC 1023 via two-dimensional spectroscopy, disentangling a kinematically and chemically decoupled stellar\ndisc (with a radius of 80 pc). The stars of this nuclear disc\nhave a mean age of 7 Gyr and are substantially younger than\nthe rest of the galaxy, which is characterized by extremely\nred integrated colours (RC3) and without global star formation (Pogge & Eskridge 1993).\n\n4\n4.1\n\nSURFACE PHOTOMETRY AND DATA\nREDUCTION\nObservations and reduction\n\nWe observed NGC 1023 during December 27-28, 2000 at\nthe 1-m Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope (JKT) located at the\nRoque de los Muchachos Observatory (ORM), La Palma.\nThe detector consisted of a SITe2 device, with 2048 \u00d7 2048\npixels and an image scale of 0.\u2032\u2032 33 pixel\u22121 , giving an unvignetted field of view of about 10\u2032 \u00d7 10\u2032 . The seeing during\nthe observing run varied from 1\u2032\u2032 to 1.\u2032\u2032 5. Tab. 1 gives the\nlog of the photometric observations. The galaxy was imaged\nusing the Harris B, V and I bandpasses. Deep observations\nwere taken in all filters, reaching \u03bcI \u2243 22 mag arcsec\u22122 and\n\u03bcB \u2243 24 mag arcsec\u22122 .\nThe images were reduced using standard IRAF\u2021 tasks.\nA run of 10 bias images was obtained each night, which were\ncombined into a single bias frame and subtracted from the\nobject frames. The images were flat-fielded using sky flats\ntaken in all filters at the beginning and end of each observing\nnight. The sky background level was removed by fitting a\n\n\u2021 IRAF is distributed by NOAO, which is operated by AURA Inc.,\nunder contract with the National Science Foundation\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n3\n\nTable 1.

The calibration constant includes corrections for atmospheric and\nGalactic extinction, and a colour term. No attempt was\nmade to correct for internal extinction. The atmospheric\nextinction was taken from the differential aerosol extinction\nfor the ORM (King 1985). The Galactic extinction in the\nB-band was taken from Schlegel et al. (1998). We used the\nGalactic extinction law from Cardelli et al. (1989) in order\nto get the extinction in the other filters.\nFig. 1 shows the reduced image of the galaxy in the\nB-band and the B \u2212 I colour map image.\n\n4.2\n\nIsophotal analysis and bar length\n\nWe analysed the isophotal profiles of the galaxy by masking\nNGC 1023A and the foreground stars, then fitting ellipses\nusing the IRAF task ELLIPSE. We first allowed the centers of\nthe ellipses to vary, to test whether the optical disc is disturbed. Within the errors of the fits, we found no evidence of\na varying center. Thus the inner disc of NGC 1023 has had\nenough time to settle if it had been disturbed in the tidal\ninteraction suggested by the H I. The ellipse fits were therefore repeated with the ellipse centers fixed; the resulting\nazimuthally averaged surface brightness, B \u2212 I colour, ellipticity and PA profiles are plotted in Fig. 2. These are in good\nagreement with the surface photometry of S\u00e1nchez-Portal et\nal. (2000), although our surface photometry reaches fainter\nsurface brightness. The PA and ellipticity profiles are similar\nfor all bandpasses, suggesting that there is little, or uniform,\nobscuration, as required for the TW method. Furthermore,\nat large radii, the B\u2212I profile (see Fig. 2) is flat, which is further evidence of little obscuration. The only structure seen\nin the B \u2212 I profile is a small gradient in the region where\nthe bulge and bar dominate. This gradient is in the sense of\na bulge redder than the disc, which is most likely caused by\nan age difference between the bulge and disc stellar populations. There is also a small colour gradient in the bar region,\nbut the color variation is not patchy and is therefore unlikely\nto be caused by dust. We fitted the PA and inclination of the\ndisc by averaging the I-band data at semi-major axis greater\nthan 80\u2032\u2032 , finding PA = 80.\u25e6 2\u00b10.\u25e6 5 and i = 66.\u25e6 4\u00b11.\u25e6 2. Application of the TW method generally requires a PA measured\nto \u223c 5\u25e6 accuracy (Debattista & Williams 2002); we note\nthat the value of the PA given in the RC3 is 87\u25e6 . Our value\nof the PA is in very good agreement with that measured by\nM\u00f6llenhoff & Heidt (2001), who found PA = 79.\u25e6 15 in the\n\n\f4\n\nV.P. Debattista, E.M. Corsini and J.A.L.

The offset slits, parallel to the major axis\nand shifted by 12\u2032\u2032 to the north and 16\u2032\u2032 to the south, are shown\nby dashed lines. The companion galaxy NGC 1023A can be seen\nto the east, just south of the major axis. The contour levels shows\nare \u03bcB = 18 to 22 mag arcsec\u22122 , at unit intervals, with the outermost contour being \u03bcB = 22 mag arcsec\u22122 . The B \u2212 I map shows\nthat the strongest colour variations are associated with the bulge\n(which is red) and NGC 1023A (which is blue).\n\nJ-band, 80.\u25e6 42 in the H-band, and 78.\u25e6 84 in the K-band, for\nan average of 79.\u25e6 5 \u00b1 0.\u25e6 7.\nWe measured the disc exponential scale-length, Rd ,\nfrom our I-band surface photometry in the region outside\nthe bar (R \u2265 80\u2032\u2032 ). We obtained Rd = 59\u2032\u2032 , corresponding\nto 2.9 kpc at our assumed distance.\nThe most natural way to measure aB is with a Fourier\nanalysis of the azimuthal luminosity profile (Ohta et al.\n1990; Aguerri et al. 2000), which we have applied here. We\nbegan by deprojecting the I-band image of the galaxy by\na flux-conserving stretch along the minor axis by the factor\n1/ cos i. NGC 1023 contains a significant spheroidal bulge:\nthe bulge-disc model decompositions of M\u00f6llenhoff & Heidt\n(2001) for this galaxy have a bulge that accounts for about\n30% to 50% of the near-infrared light. Since we have not attempted to subtract the bulge, we expect that, in deprojection, it appears as a structure elongated with the minor axis,\ndominating the center of the galaxy. We then decomposed\n\n(\n\nA0 (R)/2\n\nm=0\n\np\n\nm 6= 0\n\n(6)\n\n2\nA2m (R) + Bm\n(R)\n\nFig. 3 shows the first (m = 1, 2, 3, 4) relative Fourier amplitudes, Im /I0 , of the I-band image as a function of R. The\nbar is evidenced by a strong m = 2 component. Fig. 3 also\nshows the bar/inter-bar intensity as a function of R. The bar\nintensity, Ib , is defined as the sum of the even Fourier components, I0 + I2 , while the inter-bar intensity, Iib , is given\nby I0 \u2212 I2 (Ohta et al. 1990; Elmegreen & Elmegreen 1990;\nAguerri et al. 2000). Ohta et al. (1990) arbitrarily defined\naB as the outer radius for which Ib /Iib = 2; as Aguerri et al.\n(2000) pointed out, a fixed value of Ib /Iib cannot account\nfor the wide variety of bar luminosities present in galaxies.\nInstead, Aguerri et al. (2000) defined aB as the full width at\nhalf maximum (FWHM) of the curve of Ib /Iib . Using this\ndefinition, but excluding the peak in Ib /Iib resulting from\nthe deprojected bulge, we obtain aB = 69\u2032\u2032 \u00b1 5\u2032\u2032 . The phase\nangle, \u03b82 (R) = tan\u22121 (A2 (R)/B2 (R)), of the m = 2 component is shown in Fig. 3. The bulge dominates in the inner\n20\u2032\u2032 (with \u03b82 \u2248 90\u25e6 , as expected), with a transition from\n\u2032\u2032\nbulge to bar occurring in the range 20\u2032\u2032 <\n\u223c 50 . In the\n\u223cR<\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032 <\n<\nregion 50 \u223c R \u223c 70 , \u03b82 has a minimum, implying the bar\nextends to somewhere here. However, \u03b82 is not constant, because of the influence of the bulge and the disc, and it cannot\nbe used to determine aB .\nA independent measure of aB was obtained by deprojecting the ellipses which best fit the isophotes, averaging\nover the three bands, and examining the deprojected ellipticity, \u01eb\u2032 , as shown in Fig. 3. We find a sharp break in the\nslope of \u01eb\u2032 at 69\u2032\u2032 \u00b13\u2032\u2032 , which we identify as the end of the bar.\nWe repeated this experiment, deprojecting with different i\nand PA within the standard errors of these quantities. The\nerrors in PA do not significantly change the semi-major axis\nat which the break occurs, while those in i lead to changes\nin the break semi-major axis of \u223c 3\u2032\u2032 . Thus, our second estimate of aB = 69\u2032\u2032 \u00b1 4\u2032\u2032 . Fig. 4 plots the projected and\ndeprojected ellipses, from which the change at semi-major\naxis \u223c 70\u2032\u2032 can be discerned.\nOutside the inner 5\u2032\u2032 , the largest twist due to the bar\nof the isophotes away from the sky-plane major axis is only\n\u2243 8\u25e6 , which occurs at 40\u2032\u2032 . We measured the bar's intrinsic\nangle from the major axis, \u03c8bar , in the radial range 55\u2032\u2032 to\n70\u2032\u2032 , averaged over the 3 bands. Due to the contamination\nfrom the bulge, the deprojected isophotal ellipses are not\nconstant in this range, so we used as the uncertainty in \u03c8bar\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fA Fast Bar in the Post-Interaction Galaxy NGC 1023\n\n5\n\nFigure 2.

The bottom two panels\nshow the I\u2212band ellipticity (left) and PA (right) for R \u2265 80\u2032\u2032 , which we averaged to determine the disc's inclination and PA. The solid\nlines represent the average values in this range: \u01eb = 0.595 (corresponding to i = 66.\u25e6 4) and PA = 80.\u25e6 2.\n\nthe largest deviation from the average. Thus we obtained\n\u03c8bar = 102 \u00b1 2\u25e6 , so that the bar is only some 12\u25e6 from the\nminor axis, as can be seen in Fig. 4. This bar orientation,\ntogether with the large inclination and strong bulge, tend to\nobstruct our view of the bar. In this sense, NGC 1023 is not\nan ideal candidate for the TW method, and the expected\nvalues of V and X are likely to be small, as we show in\n\u00a76. For this combination of inclination and \u03c8bar , Debattista\n(2002) suggests an accuracy of \u223c 2.\u25e6 5 in PA is required for\naccurate measurement of \u03a9p .\n\n5\n\nLONG-SLIT SPECTROSCOPY\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n5.1\n\nObservations and data reduction\n\nThe spectroscopic observations of NGC 1023 were carried\nout at the ORM in La Palma, with the 3.6-m Telescopio\nNazionale Galileo on February 01-02, 2001. The telescope\nmounted the Low Resolution Spectrograph (DOLORES).\nThe HR-V grism No. 6 with 600 grooves mm\u22121 was used\nin combination with the 0.\u2032\u2032 7 \u00d7 8.\u2032 1 slit and the thinned\nand back-illuminated Loral CCD with 2048 \u00d7 2048 pixels\nof 15 \u00d7 15 \u03bcm2 . The wavelength range between 4697 and\n6840 \u00c5 was covered with a reciprocal dispersion of 1.055 \u00c5\npixel\u22121 , which guarantees an adequate oversampling of the\ninstrumental broadening function. Indeed, the instrumental resolution, obtained by measuring the width of emission\nlines of a comparison spectrum after the wavelength calibration, was 3.10 \u00c5 (FWHM). This corresponds to an instrumental dispersion \u03c3 = 1.32 \u00c5 (i.e., \u223c 80 and \u223c 60 km s\u22121\n\n\f6\n\nV.P. Debattista, E.M. Corsini and J.A.L. Aguerri\n\nFigure 3.

The top-right panel shows the phase angle of the m = 2\nFourier component; inside R \u2243 30\u2032\u2032 , the system is clearly dominated by the spheroidal bulge, which deprojects into a feature along the\n\u2032\u2032\n\u25e6\nminor axis. In the range 50\u2032\u2032 <\n\u223cR<\n\u223c 70 , \u03b82 reaches a minimum of \u223c 65 , but is not constant anywhere. The panel on the bottom-left\nshows the bar/inter-bar intensity ratio. The dashed line indicates one-half of the peak intensity (excluding the peak at R < 30\u2032\u2032 since\nthis is an artifact of the bulge deprojection). The panel at bottom-right shows an alternative measure of aB , based on the deprojected\nellipticities, \u01eb\u2032 ; the sharp break in \u01eb\u2032 at semi-major axis \u2243 69\u2032\u2032 (indicated by the vertical dashed line) is identified as aB .

The\nangular sampling was 0.\u2032\u2032 275 pixel\u22121 .\nWe obtained two 30-minutes spectra with the slit along\nthe major axis (PA = 80\u25e6 ) and two offset spectra with the\nslit parallel to the major axis and shifted by 12\u2032\u2032 northward\nand 16\u2032\u2032 southward. The exposure time of each offset spectrum was 60 minutes. During the observing run, we took\nspectra of the giant stars HR 2035 (G8III), HR 2429 (K1III),\nHR 2503 (K4III), HR 2701 (K0III), and HR 5370 (K3III)\nto use as templates in measuring the stellar kinematics. At\nthe beginning of each exposure, the slit was positioned by\nacquiring with DOLORES a series of target images. A spectrum of the comparison helium arc lamp was taken after\n\neach target exposure to allow an accurate wavelength calibration. The value of the seeing FWHM during the galaxy\nexposures ranged between 0.\u2032\u2032 7 and 1.\u2032\u2032 0 as measured by fitting a two-dimensional Gaussian to the guide star.\nAll the spectra were bias subtracted, flatfield corrected,\ncleaned of cosmic rays, and wavelength calibrated using\nstandard MIDAS\u00a7 routines.

Cosmic\nrays were identified by comparing the counts in each pixel\nwith the local mean and standard deviation (as obtained\nfrom Poisson statistics by taking into account the gain and\nread-out noise of the detector) and then corrected by interpolating over. The residual cosmic rays were corrected\nby manually editing the spectra. The wavelength calibration was performed by means of the MIDAS package XLONG.\nEach spectrum was rebinned using the wavelength solution obtained from the corresponding arc-lamp spectrum.\nWe checked that the wavelength rebinning had been done\nproperly by measuring the difference between the measured\nand predicted wavelengths (Osterbrock et al. 1996) for the\nbrightest night-sky emission lines in the observed spectral\nrange. The resulting accuracy in the wavelength calibration\nis \u223c 1 km s\u22121 .

In the resulting spectra, the contribution of the sky was determined\nby interpolating along the outermost 20\u2032\u2032 at the two edges\nof the slit, where the galaxy light was negligible, and then\nsubtracted.\n5.2\n\nStellar kinematics\n\nWe measured the stellar kinematics from the galaxy absorption features present in the wavelength range running\nfrom 4697 \u00c5 to 5570 \u00c5 and centered on the Mg line triplet\n(\u03bb\u03bb 5164, 5173, 5184 \u00c5). The spectra were rebinned along the\nspatial direction to obtain a nearly constant signal-to-noise\nratio larger than 20 per resolution element (with a peak of\n50 in the innermost regions of the major axis spectrum).\nAt the outermost radii the signal-to-noise ratio decreases to\n\u223c 10.

This allowed us to derive, for each spectrum,\nthe line-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD) along the slit\nand to measure its moments, namely the radial velocity v,\nthe velocity dispersion \u03c3 and the values of the coefficients\nh3 and h4 . At each radius, they have been derived by fitting\nthe LOSVD with a Gaussian plus third- and fourth-order\nGauss-Hermite polynomials H3 and H4 , which describe the\nasymmetric and symmetric deviations of the LOSVD from\na pure Gaussian profile (van der Marel & Franx 1993; Gerhard 1993). We derived errors on the LOSVD moments from\nphoton statistics and CCD read-out noise, calibrating them\nby Monte Carlo simulations as done by Bender et al. (1994)\nand Bower et al. (2001), who have recently derived the stellar kinematics of this galaxy along three axes (different from\nours). In general, our errors are in the range of 10\u201320 km s\u22121\nfor v and \u03c3, and of 0.03\u20130.1 for h3 and h4 , becoming larger\nfor signal-to-noise ratios lower than 20. These errors do not\ntake into account possible systematic effects due to any tem-\n\n6\n\nPATTERN SPEED\n\nTo compute the mean position of stars, X , along the slits, we\nextracted profiles from the B, V and I-band surface photometry along the positions of the slits. The profiles in V -band\n(within which the wavelength range used in the spectroscopy\nfalls) match very well the profiles obtained by collapsing the\nspectra along the wavelength direction, confirming that the\nslits were placed as intended. We used the broad band profiles to compute X because these are less noisy than the\nspectral profiles, particularly at large radii. We therefore\ncomputed three values of X at each slit position, XB , XV\nand XI . Each value of X was computed by Monte Carlo\nsimulation, with photon, read-out and sky noise to compute the errors. Another advantage to using the broad band\nsurface photometry is that it allows us to test for contamination by NGC 1023A to the integrals. Formally, the integrals in Eqn. 1 are over \u2212\u221e \u2264 X \u2264 \u221e, but can be limited to \u2212Xmax \u2264 X \u2264 Xmax if Xmax has reached the axisymmetric part of the disc; still larger values of Xmax add\nnoise only. In the case of NGC 1023, the presence of NGC\n1023A introduces some additional light at negative X. The\nmost severely contaminated slit is the one at 16\u2032\u2032 S, where X\ncontinues changing as ever larger values of Xmax are used.\nWe therefore found it useful to compare the 16\u2032\u2032 S profiles\nto the profiles at 16\u2032\u2032 N.

further signal to X beyond Xmax = 60\u2032\u2032 . The comparison also showed that there is little or no contamination to\nthe 16\u2032\u2032 S slit inside Xmax \u223c 55\u2032\u2032 . Furthermore, since NGC\n1023A is quite blue, the contamination decreases in going\nfrom B to V , and especially to I band. Therefore, to measure X at 16\u2032\u2032 S, we averaged the Monte Carlo results between 62\u2032\u2032 \u2264 Xmax \u2264 75\u2032\u2032 (75\u2032\u2032 \u2264 R \u2264 85\u2032\u2032 , where the disc is\nroughly axisymmetric) and then averaged over each band.\nIn the remaining slits, contamination by NGC 1023A in the\nmajor axis begins at R \u2265 100\u2032\u2032 in all bands and is easily\navoided, while the 12\u2032\u2032 N slit has no obvious contamination.\nWe therefore also averaged them over 75\u2032\u2032 \u2264 R \u2264 85\u2032\u2032 . Because of the color gradient in the inner \u223c 70\u2032\u2032 (Fig. 2), the\nvalue of X in the offset slits changes with the color band\nused, with |XI | > |XV | >\n\u223c |XB |. Therefore, by averaging over\nbands and then taking the largest discrepancy from the average as our error value, we are confident that we take into\naccount any difference between the narrow wavelength range\nof the spectroscopy and the broad one of the surface photometry. The values thus obtained are given in Tab. 3.\nIf we have successfully avoided contamination by NGC\n1023A, then we expect that, since NGC 1023 is nearly pointc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000,

The resulting spectra have been\nanalysed with the FCQ method using HR 2035 as template\nstar. V is the radial velocity derived from the LOSVD of\nthe one-dimensional spectra (see Fig. 6). For each slit position, the uncertainties on V were estimated by measuring it in different wavelength ranges between 4910 \u00c5 and\n5560 \u00c5 (but always including the Mg triplet). The V values we derived along each slit are given in Tab. 3. We integrated the spectral rows at Xmax = 140\u2032\u2032 , 100\u2032\u2032 and 80\u2032\u2032\nin the major-axis, northern and southern offset spectra, respectively.

The horizontal dotted lines indicate \u03bcV = 19 mag\narcsec\u22122 and \u03bcV = 21 mag arcsec\u22122 . The 3 panels on the right indicate the LOSVD for the three slits (12\u2032\u2032 N, major axis and 16\u2032\u2032 S from\ntop to bottom), with V indicated by the dashed lines. The LOSVDs are constructed from the Gauss-Hermite moments; the 3 LOSVDs in\neach of these panels were obtained from different wavelength ranges (here, each is renormalized to the same maximum value, for clarity).\nThe central panel plots V against X (solid circles); the slope of the best fit straight line (indicated by the solid line) is \u03a9p sin i = 4.7 \u00b1 1.7\nkm s\u22121 arcsec\u22121 . The open triangles and dotted line indicates the results for using just the I-band to measure X , which gives the largest\nvalues of |X | and therefore the smallest slope, \u03a9p sin i = 4.0 \u00b1 1.4 km s\u22121 arcsec\u22121 .\n\ndecided to also try Xmax = 60\u2032\u2032 , to check for contamination\nby NGC 1023A.

The values of V we derived by\nintegrating both offset spectra out to Xmax = 140\u2032\u2032 (after\nremoving by linear interpolation the contribution of foreground stars) are close to those in Tab. 3, although their\nerrors increase by a factor 1.6 and 2 along the north and\nsouth slit, respectively. Therefore, within the errors obtained\nfrom the varying wavelength range, there is no evidence of\ncontamination by NGC 1023A in V for the southern offset\nslit.\nBy performing our analysis with all the remaining tem-\n\nTable 3.

(1994)\non the determination of the radial velocities with FCQ.\nUsing the data of Tab. 3, in Fig. 7 we plot V versus X ,\nfitting a straight line (using subroutine fitexy in Numerical Recipes). The slope of this line is \u03a9p sin i = 4.7 \u00b1 1.7\nkm s\u22121 arcsec\u22121 , which gives \u03a9p = 5.1\u00b11.8 km s\u22121 arcsec\u22121\n(corresponding to \u03a9p = 104\u00b134 km s\u22121 kpc\u22121 at 10.2 Mpc).\nWe have also fitted a \"slowest-bar\" line, using the values of\nXI (which are largest, and therefore give a shallower slope)\nin the 12\u2032\u2032 N and major-axis, and adopting the value of XI\nfrom 16\u2032\u2032 N, which gives a slightly larger |X | than the 16\u2032\u2032 S\nprofile. The slope of this line, now ignoring the uncertainties\nin X , is \u03a9p sin i = 4.0 \u00b1 1.4 km s\u22121 arcsec\u22121 (\u03a9p = 4.3 \u00b1 1.5\nkm s\u22121 arcsec\u22121 ).\nTo then determine R, we need to measure DL , which\nwe approximate by the co-rotation radius, Rc , from the axisymmetric approximation. Debattista (1998) found that,\nfor strong bars in N -body simulations, the approximation\nDL \u2243 Rc involves an error of \u223c 5%. We therefore measured\nthe rotation curve, Vc (R), of NGC 1023. This is a two step\nprocess: first we fitted tilted rings (with constant PA and\ninclination fixed to the value obtained from the surface photometry) to the data from all our slits, interpolating with\ncubic splines where necessary. This allowed us to measure\nthe heliocentric systemic velocity, Vsys = 613 \u00b1 3 km s\u22121 ,\nwhich is compared to the values based on optical data available in the literature in Tab. 4. By folding the major axis\nslit (which reaches furthest out in R) about the origin, after subtracting out Vsys , we obtained the stellar streaming\nvelocities, V\u2217 (R), shown in Fig. 8.\nWe tested V\u2217 (R) by rotating it into the orientations of\nother slit observations available in the literature. The slits\nwe compared with are those at PA = 87\u25e6 (Simien & Prugniel\n1997; Neistein et al. 1999), PA = 90\u25e6 (Bower et al. 2001) and\nPA = 177\u25e6 (Simien & Prugniel 1997). Excluding the inner\n2\u2032\u2032 , to avoid the effects of different seeing and/or slit widths,\n\u25e6\nwe find \u03c7\u03032 <\n\u223c 1 in all cases except for the PA = 87 slit of\nNeistein et al. (1999), for which we obtained \u03c7\u03032 = 2.5 (for\n27 points). Since the same PA is also covered by a slit from\nSimien & Prugniel (1997), which we match well (\u03c7\u03032 = 0.8 for\n36 points), we conclude that the stellar streaming velocity\nprofile we obtained is reasonable and in good agreement with\nprevious data.\nWe then corrected for the asymmetric drift using the\nvelocity dispersion data, to recover the true circular velocity,\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nFigure 8. The stellar velocity streaming curve, V\u2217 , derived by\nsubtracting Vsys , folding and deprojecting the observed velocities\non the major axis. The data from the major axis are shown in diamonds (approaching side) and stars (receding side). The solid line\nand the dashed lines flanking it are our fitted spline together\nwith\np\nthe 1\u03c3 error interval. The asymmetric drift terms ( Vc2 \u2212 V\u22172 )\nare shown by the dot-dashed, dotted, and dash triple-dotted lines\n(\u03b1 = 0.0, 0.5, and 1.0 respectively) in the lower-right corner at\nR \u2265 70\u2032\u2032 . The corresponding circular rotation curves, Vc , are\nshown in the bold lines.\n\nVc (R). Following Eqn. 4-33 in Binney & Tremaine (1987),\nand assuming \u2202(vR vz )/\u2202z \u2243 0, we can write the asymmetric\ndrift equation as:\n2\nVc2 \u2212 V\u22172 = \u2212\u03c3R\n\n\u0014\n\n2\n\u2202 ln \u03c1\n\u2202 ln \u03c3R\n+\n+\n\u2202 ln R\n\u2202 ln R\n\n\u0012\n\n1\u2212\n\n\u03c3\u03c62\n2\n\u03c3R\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\n.\n\n(7)\n\nThe observed velocity dispersion, at a point (R, \u03c6) in the\ngalaxy frame, is given by:\n2\n\u03c3los\n\n=\n\u2261\n\n\u0002 2\n\u0003\n1\n2\nsin2 i (\u03c3R\n+ \u03c3\u03c62 + 2\u03c3z2 cot2 i) \u2212 (\u03c3R\n\u2212 \u03c3\u03c62 ) cos 2\u03c6\n2\na(R, \u03c6) + b(R, \u03c6) cos 2\u03c6.\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03c6 = 0 is taken to be the disc's major axis. When the\ndisc is axisymmetric, a and b can only depend on R, in which\ncase a and b are simply the first 2 even moments in a Fourier\nexpansion of the line-of-sight velocity dispersion. For a disc\n2\nwith a flat rotation curve, \u03c3\u03c62 /\u03c3R\n= 1/2, which then allows\n2\nus to obtain \u03c3R from b. However, the profile of V\u2217 we found\nfor NGC 1023 is not obviously flat. (Furthermore, b is more\nsensitive to noisy data than is a.) In the general case, the\nasymmetric drift equation can be re-written in terms of both\na and b, as follows:\nR\na\u2212b\n\u2202\n\u2212\n(a \u2212 b)\n\u2202R\nsin2 i(1 + \u03b12 cot2 i) Rd\n2b\n,\n(9)\n+\nsin2 i\nwhere we have assumed that the disc density is exponential with scale-length Rd and \u03b1 \u2261 \u03c3z /\u03c3R . Using the velocity\ndispersion data from our 3 slits and the near minor-axis\ndata of Simien & Prugniel (1997), we measured a \u2212 b and\n\nVc2 \u2212 V\u22172\n\n=\n\nh\n\ni\n\n\f12\n\nV.P. Debattista, E.M. Corsini and J.A.L. Aguerri\n\nFigure 9. The average value, a, (top panel) and the cos 2\u03c6 component, b, (bottom panel) of the squared observed velocity dispersions. The top panel also indicates a \u2212 b. We fit straight lines\nto a \u2212 b and b at R \u2265 70\u2032\u2032 , as indicated.\n\nb. We fitted splines to interpolate between data points, and\nestimate errors from Monte Carlo simulation with Gaussian\nnoise added from the error estimate on each point. The resulting profiles of a and b are shown in Fig. 9. Our procedure\nfor measuring V\u2217 (R), a and b is valid only in the axisymmetric region outside the bar. Therefore we only apply the\nasymmetric drift correction to R > 70\u2032\u2032 ; for this region, we\nfit straight lines to a \u2212 b = \u2212141 (\u00b161) R + 41884 (\u00b1562)\nkm2 s\u22122 and to b = \u2212319 (\u00b139)R + 8706 (\u00b1350) km2 s\u22122 .\nWith these values, we then correct the rotation curve, assuming 0.0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 1.0. (This range of \u03b1 is a reasonable one:\nin the Solar neighborhood, Dehnen & Binney (1998) found\n\u03b1 \u2243 0.54+0.02\n\u22120.05 , while in NGC 488, Gerssen et al. (1997) measured \u03b1 = 0.70 \u00b1 0.19.) The resulting rotation curve is more\n\u22121\nor less flat, with 259 <\n\u223c Vc,f lat <\n\u223c 278 km s . Adding in\nquadrature a velocity uncertainty of 30 km s\u22121 , we obtain\nVc,flat = 270 \u00b1 31 km s\u22121 . (For comparison, Neistein et al.\n1999 found Vc = 250 \u00b1 17 km s\u22121 ; we have checked that,\nusing a method similar to their Eqn. 8, gives similar values\nfor Vc,f lat to those reported above.) If we extrapolate this\nvalue to smaller radii (which, at worst, over-estimates Rc\nand, correspondingly, R, unless the rotation curve is drop\u2032\u2032\nping between 40\u2032\u2032 <\nfrom\n\u223c R \u2264 70 , which seems unlikely\n\u2032\u2032\nFig. 8) we find Rc = Vc,flat /\u03a9p = 53 \u00b1 6+29\n\u221214 , where the\nfirst error is due to the uncertainties in Vc,f lat and the second error reflects uncertainties in \u03a9p . We obtain, therefore,\nR = 0.77 \u00b1 0.10+0.42\n\u22120.20 (where the first error now also includes\nthe uncertainty in aB ). For our \"slowest-bar\" estimate of the\nslope, we find R = 0.91 \u00b1 0.12+0.49\n\u22120.23 . We have found, therefore, that the bar in NGC 1023 is consistent with being a\nfast bar.\n\n7\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have found that the bar in NGC 1023 is fast, as are all\nbars which have been measured to date. Debattista & Sell-\n\nwood (1998, 2000) showed that fast bars can persist only if\nthe disc is maximal. Following Ostriker & Peebles (1973),\nit is sometimes thought that the unbarred (SA) galaxies are\nstabilized by massive DM halos. However, massive DM halos\nare not necessary for stabilizing discs; a rapidly rising rotation curve in the inner disc, such as when a massive bulge is\npresent, is also able to inhibit bar formation (Toomre 1981;\nSellwood & Evans 2001). Debattista & Sellwood (1998) argued that unbarred HSB galaxies must also be maximal for,\nif HSB disc galaxies form a continuum of DM halo masses\nspanning massive DM halo-stabilised SA galaxies to maximal SB galaxies, then slow bars must also be found in the\nintermediate range of halo masses. If we seek to avoid intermediate halo masses and slow bars by postulating (for whatever reason) a bimodal DM halo mass distribution for HSB\ngalaxies, then we are left with the possibility that tidal interactions can still form bars, which would be slow (Noguchi\n1987; Salo 1991; Miwa & Noguchi 1998). Thus Debattista &\nSellwood (2000) concluded that the absence of slow bars requires that all HSB disc galaxies are maximal. However, it\nis possible that no such slow bars have been found because\nof an observational bias against SB systems with evidence\nof tidal interactions.\nWe have chosen to study NGC 1023, in part, because it\nshows signs of a weak interaction in its past, without being\nat present significantly perturbed. The fast bar we found\nindicates that NGC 1023 has a maximal disc. If SA galaxies\nare stabilized by massive halos, we should find slow bars in\nthat fraction of SB galaxies in which the bar formed through\nthe interaction. While it is not possible to reach a general\nconclusion on the DM content of SA galaxies based on our\nmeasurement for a single galaxy, a large enough sample of\nsimilar SB galaxies with mild interactions in the past will\nbe able to address this question.\nAcknowledgements.\nV.P.D. and J.A.L.A. acknowledge support by the Schweizerischer Nationalfonds through grant 20-56888.99.
