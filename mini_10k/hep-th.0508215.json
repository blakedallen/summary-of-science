In modern theoretical physics we have become accustomed to\nstring theories where extra dimensions are required in order to have\nfinite predictions. These unobserved dimensions are then often taken\nto be small, compact and outside our experimental grasp.\nThe idea of extra dimensions is not altogether new, but was originally considered by Kaluza and Klein [1] in a bid to geometrically\ncombine gravity and electromagnetism. Now, with the emergence of\nM -theory, we have new models in which our universe is considered\nas a four dimensional hypersurface in a larger bulk spacetime. These\nbrane scenarios stem from a string model suggested by Horava and\nWitten [2], where the particles of the Standard Model are constrained\nto a hypersurface and remain four dimensional, while gravity is free\nto explore the full spacetime.\nThe motivations for studying these models include such things as a\nneed to account for inflation and dark energy, and resolving the hierarchy problem [3, 4]. In many of these models the brane universe\nis embedded in a 5-D AdS spacetime. The expansion of the universe\nis now viewed as arising from the motion of the brane through the\ncurved spacetime, where the scale factor a(t) appears as a transverse\ncoordinate describing the location of the brane. This motion of the\nbrane through the bulk is determined by junction conditions [5] that\nrelate the energy content of the brane to its dynamics. In general it\nis found that the brane accelerates through its bulk spacetime.\nThe concept of accelerated particle detectors in Minkowski spacetime\nwas developed in the 1970s. In its simplest form, the particle detector\nis envisaged as a point particle with discrete internal energy levels,\nwhich is coupled to a quantum field. Unruh [6] showed that such a detector moving with constant acceleration a, in Minkowski spacetime,\nperceives the vacuum state of the field to be a thermal reservoir with\na\n. This effect is not without its subtleties; for extemperature T = 2\u03c0\nample a distinction must be made between particle content and energy\ntransitions. It turns out that it is, in some sense, more meaningful to\nspeak of energy excitations rather than particle content [7, 8]. The\nresults for 4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime have been extended to\ncurved spacetimes such as de Sitter spacetime\nwhere a generalised\nq\nGibbons-Hawking temperature [9] of T = \u039b3 + a2 /2\u03c0 is found, with\n\u039b being the cosmological constant for the spacetime.\nQuantum field theory in Anti-de Sitter spacetime possesses certain\ndelicate features, such as its lack of global hyperbolicity [10]. Despite such difficulties it is found that an identical result to de Sitter\n\n2\n\n\fspacetime holds, but this\nq time the temperature switches off below the\n\ncritical acceleration of |\u039b|\n3 . This result has been shown to hold in a\ngeneral field theory framework where basic stability assumptions for\nthe vacuum hold true [11, 12]. Explicit results for the transition rates\nof an Unruh detector in 4-D Anti-de Sitter spacetime have also been\ncalculated [13].\nSince branes in general accelerate through their bulk spacetimes, we\nwould expect that some form of the Unruh effect would arise, and\ncause energy excitations on the brane. We may then consider the simplest such model consisting of a single brane moving through an AdS\nbulk and allow it to couple to a bulk scalar field in its vacuum state.\nWe aim to demonstrate explicitly the Unruh effect for N-dimensional\nAdS spacetime and calculate the energy excitations for a quantum\nsystem moving through such a spacetime.\nWe organise this paper as follows: In section 2 we establish some basic results concerning brane cosmologies. In section 3 we derive the\nnecessary Wightman functions for a scalar field in N-dimensional AdS\nspacetime and analyse their limiting behaviours. In section 4 we calculate the detector response functions for basic stationary trajectories\nin AdS and demonstrate certain modifications to the Unruh effect that\nare dependent on the dimensionality of the spacetime and on the curvature of the spacetime. In sections 5 and 6 we analyse the excitations\nof an accelerated brane by calculating the separate contributions due\nto vacuum fluctuations and back reactions from the bulk spacetime.\nWe show that the back reactions are altered in odd dimensions, while\nthe vacuum fluctuations are altered in even dimensions and provide an\nacceleration dependent excitation of the matter fields on the brane.\nWe observe that this effect would be relevant in the early universe\nwhen accelerations are large, but also in the late time universe where\nan asymptotic thermal equilibrium is achieved between the brane and\nthe bulk. In section 7 we gather the main conclusions of this paper.\n\n3\n\n\f2\n\nAcceleration of the Brane\n\nIn this section we review the dynamics of a single Z2 -symmetric brane\nin a 5-D bulk spacetime [15, 16].\nThe motion of the symmetric brane is determined by the DarmoisIsrael junction conditions1 , which state that the jump in its extrinsic\ncurvature, [KAB ], obeys the equation [5]\n1\n[KAB ] = \u2212\u03ba2 (TAB \u2212 hAB T )\n3\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere TAB is the energy momentum tensor for the brane and hAB is\nthe induced metric. We now consider the tangential component of this\nextrinsic curvature, along its trajectory and define\nK|| = uA uB KAB .\n\n(2.2)\n\nIt is a simple matter to show that\nK|| = \u2212nB aB\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere aB = uA \u2207A uB , is the acceleration of the brane and nA is a\nunit vector field normal to the brane. Since we shall consider a codimension one brane, we deduce that\nK|| = \u2212a.\n\n(2.4)\n\nUsing this, together with the junction condition and the mirror symmetry, we obtain that the acceleration of the brane is given by\na =\n\n\u03ba2\n(2\u03c1 + 3p \u2212 \u03c3)\n6\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhere \u03c3 is the tension for the brane, \u03c1 is its density and p is the\npressure. We see that in general the brane does not move along a\ngeodesic.\nA bulk spacetime that is consistent with demands of homogeneity and\nisotropy for the brane universe is 5-D AdS-Schwarzschild. We may\nobtain a modified FRW equation for a brane universe embedded in an\nAdS-Schwarzschild spacetime, whose metric is given by\nds2 = \u2212f (r)dt2 +\n1\n\ndr 2\n+ r 2 d\u03a923\nf (r)\n\n(2.6)\n\nThis condition is not sufficient if the Z2 symmetry is relaxed, see for example [14]\nand [20].\n\n4\n\n\fwhere d\u03a923 is the metric on the maximally symmetric 3-space that\npossesses a scale factor r(\u03c4 ), where \u03c4 is the proper time for the brane.\nIf we take the universe to be flat, the function f (r) is then given by\nf (r) = k2 r 2 \u2212\n\nC\n.\nr2\n\n(2.7)\n\nUsing the spatial components of the junction conditions, we obtain\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u1e59\n\u03ba4 2 \u03ba4 \u03c3\nC\n\u039b4\nH2 =\n=\n\u03c1 +\n\u03c1+ 4 +\n(2.8)\nr\n36\n18\nr\n3\nThis reproduces standard cosmology in the low density regime, but\ncontains a quadratic density term and a dark radiation term that\nbecome relevant in the very early universe. The effective cosmological\nconstant for the brane universe is given in terms of the brane tension\nand AdS mass parameter as\n\u0013\n\u0012 4 2\n\u03ba \u03c3\n2\n\u2212k .\n(2.9)\n\u039b4 = 3\n36\nSince the brane accelerates through its bulk spacetime we might expect\nit to experience some form of Unruh radiation which would produce\nenergy excitations of the fields on the brane. It can be shown [17] that,\nto lowest order in the coupling constant c, the probability amplitude\nfor transitions from the ground state |E0 > of a particle detector\ncoupled to a scalar field in its vacuum state |0 > is given by\nX\n| < E|M |E0 > |2 F(E)\n(2.10)\nc2\nE\n\nwhere M is the detector observable that is coupled to the field, and\nwe define the detector response function F(E) and the Wightman\nfunction G + (x, x\u2032 ) as\nZ\n\u2032\nF(E) =\ndtdt\u2032 G + (x(t), x(t\u2032 ))e\u2212i(E\u2212E0 )(t\u2212t )\nG + (x, x\u2032 ) = < 0|\u03c6(x)\u03c6(x\u2032 )|0 > .\n\n(2.11)\n\nWe see that if the detector response function does not vanish then excitations will be measured by the detector. In many cases the detector\nis placed on a stationary trajectory for which the Wightman function\nbecomes a function of \u2206\u03c4 = \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 \u2032 , where \u03c4 is the proper time along\nthe path. In this case the response function is ill-defined and it makes\nphysical sense to consider instead the response function per unit time\nZ \u221e\nF(E)\nd\u2206\u03c4 e\u2212i(E\u2212E0 )\u2206\u03c4 G + (\u2206\u03c4 ).\n(2.12)\n=\nT\n\u2212\u221e\n\n5\n\n\fIn the next section we shall derive the Wightman functions for a scalar\nfield in Anti-de Sitter spacetime that are necessary to discuss any\nUnruh effect that a brane, coupled to such a field, would experience.\n\n3\n\nScalar field in N-dimensional AdS\n\nIn recent times an extensive body of work has grown up around Antide Sitter spacetime, and it is this spacetime that often provides the\nsetting for brane models of cosmology. It is necessary to derive some\nbasic results that are needed in order to deal with a brane coupled to\nany bulk fields. It is no great inconvenience to talk in generalities, and\nso we may consider an N dimensional AdS spacetime with constant\nRicci scalar R = \u2212N (N \u2212 1)k2 .

In this section we consider a brane, coupled to this bulk scalar\nfield, that is moving along certain stationary trajectories in the AdS\nspacetime. The most basic stationary trajectories are the timelike\ngeodesic, and the constant acceleration trajectories. We expect the\nresponse function per unit time to vanish along geodesics, and consequently the inertial brane experiences no excitation from the bulk\nvacuum. We shall also find that excitations only occur above a certain\ncritical acceleration. For simplicity we assume that the scalar field is\nconformally coupled to gravity. We shall find that it behaves like a\nfermion in odd dimensions and a boson in even dimensions. The relevant Wightman function for such a field is given by (3.14) and for\nsimplicity we take the ground state energy E0 to be zero.\n\n4.1\n\nGeodesics\n\nWe work with the conformally flat metric\nds2 =\n\n1\n(dt2 \u2212 dx21 \u2212 dx22 \u2212 * * * \u2212 dx2N \u22122 \u2212 dz 2 )\nk2 z 2\n\n(4.1)\n\nand restrict motion to the z \u2212 t plane. The timelike geodesics may be\nwritten as\n\u03b3kt = tan(k\u03c4 + A)\n\u03b3kz = sec(k\u03c4 + A)\n\n(4.2)\n\nwhere \u03b3 and A are constants and \u03c4 is the proper time.\nWe wish to consider G + (x(\u03c4 ), x(\u03c4 \u2032 )) and expect it to be purely a function of \u2206\u03c4 = \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 \u2032 . To this end we must calculate v(\u03c4, \u03c4 \u2032 ), given by\n(3.11), along the trajectory. It is easily seen that\nv(\u03c4, \u03c4 \u2032 ) = cos(k\u2206\u03c4 \u2212 i\u01eb)\n\n(4.3)\n\nand substitution into (3.14) gives that\n\"\n#\n1\n1\nG + (\u2206\u03c4 ) = B\n\u2212\nN\nN\n(cos(k\u2206\u03c4 \u2212 i\u01eb) \u2212 1) 2 \u22121 (cos(k\u2206\u03c4 \u2212 i\u01eb) + 1) 2 \u22121\nwhere\nB =\n\nkN \u22122 \u0393( N2 \u2212 1)\nN\n\n2(2\u03c0) 2\n\n10\n\n.\n\n(4.4)\n\n\fAll the poles of this function lie in the upper half plane, at the points\nn\u03c0\nk + i\u01eb, n \u2208 Z. Since E > 0 the integral\nZ \u221e\ne\u2212iE\u2206\u03c4 G + (\u2206\u03c4 )d\u2206\u03c4\n(4.5)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nmay be evaluated by closing a contour in the lower half plane. There\nis a complete absence of poles in this region, and so we deduce that\nthe integral vanishes. No excitations are observed, as is expected for\na geodesic path.\n\n4.2\n\nTrajectories of constant acceleration\n\nAlthough no excitations are observed for an inertial brane, it is expected that some form of the Unruh effect will occur for accelerated\ntrajectories through the curved spacetime. The simplest of these trajectories are those where the acceleration remains constant throughout.\nBy considering planar intersections with AdS in a flat embedding space\nit is possible to obtain all constant acceleration curves [18]. These\ncurves are effectively conic sections of the AdS spacetime. There\nare three classes of constant acceleration timelike curves: elliptic,\nparabolic and hyperbolic. Elliptic trajectories are those curves for\nwhich the acceleration, a, satisfies a2 < k2 , parabolic curves are those\nthat satisfy a2 = k2 , while hyperbolic trajectories satisfy a2 > k2 .\nThe acceleration is then said to be subcritical, critical or supercritical\nrespectively.\n\n4.2.1\n\nSubcritical accelerations\n\nWe may describe trajectories with accelerations below k in the Poincar\u00e9\ncoordinate system by\nt(\u03c4 ) = z0 k sinh \u03b3(\u03c4 )\nz(\u03c4 ) = z0 k cosh \u03b3(\u03c4 ) + z0 a\n(4.6)\nwith\ncosh \u03b3(\u03c4 ) =\n\n\u221a\na cos( k2 \u2212 a2 \u03c4 ) \u2212 k\n\u221a\n.\na \u2212 k cos( k2 \u2212 a2 \u03c4 )\n\n(4.7)\n\nEvaluating at two points along a given trajectory we obtain that\nv(\u03c4, \u03c4 \u2032 ) =\n\np\nk2\ncos(\nk2 \u2212 a2 \u2206\u03c4 \u2212 i\u01eb)\nk2 \u2212 a2\n\n11\n\n(4.8)\n\n\fwhich gives that\n+\n\nG (\u2206\u03c4 ) =\n\nB\n\nB\n\n\u2212\n\u221a\n\u221a\nN\nN\n2\n2\n( k2k\u2212a2 cos( k2 \u2212 a2 \u03c4 \u2212 i\u01eb) \u2212 1) 2 \u22121 ( k2k\u2212a2 cos( k2 \u2212 a2 \u03c4 \u2212 i\u01eb) + 1) 2 \u22121\n\nNo poles exist in the lower half plane, and no excitations from the\nground state are detected for subcritical accelerations.\n\n4.2.2\n\nCritical accelerations\n\nTrajectories with critical accelerations may be described as\nz = z0\nt = kz0 \u03c4.\n\n(4.9)\n\nFor two points along such a trajectory with have\nv(\u03c4, \u03c4 \u2032 ) = 1 \u2212\n\nk2\n(\u2206\u03c4 \u2212 i\u01eb)2\n2\n\n(4.10)\n\nand so\nG + (\u2206\u03c4 ) = B\n\n2N \u22122\n\u2212\nkN \u22122 (\u2206\u03c4 \u2212 i\u01eb)N \u22122 (2 \u2212\n\n1\nk2\n2 (\u2206\u03c4\n\nN\n\n\u2212 i\u01eb)2 ) 2 \u22121\n\n!\n\n.\n\nIt is clear that once again all singularities lie in the upper half plane,\nand so there will be no excitations detected.

We follow [21] and\nproceed to separate these excitations into those that stem primarily\nfrom fluctuations in the bulk vacuum, and those that are due to the\ndisturbance of the bulk scalar field resulting from the matter coupling.\nThe model consists of a quantum system with no internal spatial variations, discrete multiple energy levels {Ei } and that is coupled to a\nscalar field \u03c6(x) by a term cM (\u03c4 )\u03c6(x(\u03c4 )), where \u03c4 is the proper time\nalong the trajectory of the multilevel system. This discrete system represents the accelerated brane. The Hamiltonian for the whole model\nis then\nZ\ndt\nHtotal = H(\u03c4 ) + d3 k a\u2020 (k, t)a(k, t)\u03c9(k) + cM (\u03c4 )\u03c6(x(\u03c4 ))\nd\u03c4\nwith H(\u03c4 ) the Hamiltonian for the discrete system and {a(k, t)} a\nmode decomposition for the scalar field.\nWe now divide each physical variable into a free part and a source\npart. The free part is present as c \u2192 0, while the source part is first\norder in c - its presence arising from the exchange of energy via the\nmonopole coupling\nH(\u03c4 ) = H0 (\u03c4 ) + Hs (\u03c4 )\nM (\u03c4 ) = M0 (\u03c4 ) + Ms (\u03c4 )\n\u03c6(\u03c4 ) = \u03c60 (\u03c4 ) + \u03c6s (\u03c4 ).\n\n(5.1)\n\nThe source part of an arbitrary brane operator, X, is then given, to\nfirst order in c, by\nZ \u03c4\nXs (\u03c4 ) = ic\nd\u03c4 \u2032 \u03c60 (x(\u03c4 \u2032 ))[M0 (\u03c4 \u2032 ), X0 (\u03c4 )]\n(5.2)\n\u03c40\n\nwhile the source part of an arbitrary field operator, Y , is\nZ \u03c4\nYs (x(\u03c4 )) = ic\nd\u03c4 \u2032 M0 (\u03c4 \u2032 )[\u03c60 (x(\u03c4 \u2032 )), Y0 (\u03c4 )].\n\n(5.3)\n\n\u03c40\n\nFor a given observable, X, of the discrete system we may consider the\ncontribution to its time evolution due to the scalar field \u03c6.

This would be the asymptotic temperature of the\nbulk field if no energy exchange was permitted between the brane and\nthe bulk thermal state. If energy exchange is allowed, the possibility\nexists that the universe will settle down to an equilibrium temperature Te , which is above the zero density value. We can see that at\nleast one other point exists where the brane is at the same temperature as the bulk since away from \u03c11 and \u03c12 the bulk temperature\nvaries almost linearly with \u03c1, while the brane temperature is generally\na fractional power of \u03c1. If the thermal coupling between the brane and\nbulk is strong the evolution of the temperatures is complicated. The\nissue of whether, for example, the current thermal state of the universe is determined from couplings to a bulk spacetime would depend\non, among other things, the properties of the bulk and the heating\ntime scale. Whether any thermal equilibrium point is stable or not\nwill depend on the rate of the thermal exchange between the brane\nand bulk [22]. If it is stable then the universe will remain at a nonzero density and temperature, \u03c1e and Te . If this point is unstable\nthe density of the universe will drop below \u03c12 , where its bulk motion\nbecomes subcritical and the Unruh temperature of the bulk vanishes.\nThe temperature of the bulk will switch back on when the density of\nthe universe passes below \u03c11 , and increases until thermal equilibrium\nis achieved at the Gibbons-Hawking temperature TGH .\n\n22\n\n\f7\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper we made the observation that, in general, branes accelerate through their bulk spacetimes and so any fields, coupled to matter\non the brane and in their vacuum state, will be perceived as a thermal\nreservoir. Effectively the matter fields of the universe play the role of\nan accelerated particle detector in the bulk spacetime.\nWe restricted our attentions to AdS spacetimes, and in particular to\ngeodesics and constant acceleration trajectories. The latter trajectories being further subdivided into three cases, depending on whether\nthe acceleration was greater than, equal to, or less than the mass scale\nk of the spacetime.\nWe obtained a consistent set of limits on the Wightman functions for\nN -dimensional AdS spacetime and derived the Wightman function for\na conformally coupled, massles scalar field in such a spacetime.\nWe showed that the transfer function vanished for all of the basic stationary trajectories except for those with a supercritical acceleration.\nIn this case we obtain a thermal distribution which is fermionic in odd\ndimensions, bosonic in even dimensions, and possessing a polynomial\nweighting which was curvature dependent. We analysed these thermal\nexcitations in more detail by calculating the vacuum fluctuations and\nback reactions seperately for a discrete, multilevel system coupled to\nthe scalar field. For this we were able to extract a characteristic time\nfor the process.\nWe then considered the asymptotic behaviour of a brane universe,\nwhose acceleration through the bulk approaches a contant value. For\na non-empty brane, thermal equilibrium with the bulk can occur at a\nnon-zero density. It was also shown that if the density of the brane is\nzero then any fields in their vacuum states would\nq be perceived to be\n\u039b4\n1\nat the Gibbons-Hawking temperature TGH = 2\u03c0\n3 . In this context\nit is possible to recast the Gibbons-Hawking effect as an Unruh effect\nin an embedding spacetime.\n\nAcknowledgements\nIt is a pleasure to thank Prof. Anne Davis and Prof. Ian Drummond\nfor useful and friendly conversations.
