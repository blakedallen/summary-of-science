INTRODUCTION\n\nCompact binary systems of neutron stars and black holes inspiralling under gravitational radiation reaction are\none of the most promising sources of gravitational waves for kilometre arm length interferometric gravitational wave\ndetectors like the LIGO and VIRGO. The inspiral phase is best described by a post-Newtonian approximation which\nshould eventually break down and the final merger and coalescence may be only accessible via numerical integration\nof Einstein's equations. A major obstacle in the numerical studies of such systems is the non-availability of physically\nsatisfactory initial data. Given the constraints on computational resources, one would like to start the numerical\nintegration as close as possible to the final coalescence phase, using the initial data obtained by matching on to the\nknown analytical results of inspiral. One of the suggestions in this direction is to use the analytical post-Newtonian\nresults of inspiral to provide initial data (e.g. [1]- [2]) for the numerical integration of the fully general relativistic\nsystem.\nBefore attempting to apply the above strategy to the complicated compact binary system, as a preliminary step,\nShinkai [3] has constructed a single neutron star model using the post-Newtonian approach and concluded that the\ntruncated second order post-Newtonian approximation is close enough to describe a general relativistic single star.\nThe truncated post-Newtonian series used above is essentially a Taylor expansion in the three small parameters\nA = p/(\u03c1t c2 ), B = 4\u03c0pr3 /(mc2 ) and C = 2Gm/(rc2 ) where p is the pressure, \u03c1t , the total energy density of the\nsystem, r the radial coordinate, and m(r) the mass contained in a sphere of radial coordinate r. We shall refer to\nthe post-Newtonian truncated models alternatively as Taylor models. Recently, in a related context of gravitational\nwave phasing, the slow convergence of straightforward Taylor approximants has been critically investigated [4] [5]. It\nwas shown that new approximants, with much improved convergence properties, may be constructed for gravitational\nwave data analysis applications using, as an important tool, Pad\u00e9 techniques to estimate the relevant functions from\nonly the first few terms in their perturbative post-Newtonian expansion. This approach has been systematically\nextended in a series of publications [6] [7] and most recently has been used to go beyond the adiabatic approximation\nto inspiral and provide an analysis of the transition from the inspiral to the plunge in binary black hole coalescences\n[2]. This work also provides for the first time initial dynamical data (positions and momenta) for binary black holes\nstarting to plunge, so that there is less than an orbit left to evolve. In view of this experience, in this report, we\nconstruct Pad\u00e9 approximants to the truncated post-Newtonian (Taylor) neutron star models discussed by Shinkai [3]\nand investigate their performance. We show that the Pad\u00e9 models are better than the truncated post-Newtonian\nmodels and converge faster to the exact general relativistic solution. Further, we also show that the evolution of a\ngeneral relativistic (single) star is described much better by Pad\u00e9 initial data as compared to the truncated Taylor\ninitial data of the same order.\nIn the next section we discuss the TOV equation and the truncated post-Newtonian models. In Section III we\nintroduce the standard Pad\u00e9 approximant, discuss its applicability to the present problem, and adapt it to construct\nan appropriate generalisation for the case of 3-small parameters. Pad\u00e9 models corresponding to the 'Taylor' truncated\nmodels are constructed. In the last section we discuss the results and summarise our conclusions. The Appendix lists\nthe more involved formulas for the 3PN Pad\u00e9 models.\n\n1\n\n\fII. TOV EQUATION AND TRUNCATED POST-NEWTONIAN (TAYLOR) NEUTRON STAR MODELS\n\nIn general relativity the metric of a spherically symmetric static star can be written as\nds2 = \u2212e2\u03bd(r) dt2 + e2\u03bb(r) dr2 + r2 (d\u03b82 + r2 sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ),\n\n(2.1)\n\nand the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium - the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations - obtained (in\ngeometrised units: G = c = M\u2299 = 1) from the Einstein field equations, for a given fluid distribution specified by an\nadiabatic equation of state p = p(\u03c1t ), are given by:\ndm\n= 4\u03c0r2 \u03c1t ,\ndr\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\ndp\n2m\np\n4\u03c0pr3\nm\u03c1t\n1\u2212\n,\n1+\n=\u2212 2 1+\ndr\nr\n\u03c1t\nm\nr\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\n\u0012\n2m\n4\u03c0pr3\nm\nd\u03bd\n1\u2212\n.\n= 2 1+\ndr\nr\nm\nr\n\n(2.2)\n(2.3)\n(2.4)\n\nm is given in terms of metric component \u03bb as\ne\n\n2\u03bb\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\n2m\n= 1\u2212\n.\nr\n\n(2.5)\n\nThe above set of equations are integrated from the center (r = 0) to the boundary of the star, with the initial\nconditions m(r = 0) = 0; \u03c1t (r = 0) = \u03c1tc and \u03bd(r = 0) = \u03bdc . \u03bdc is rescaled appropriately such that it matches with\nthe exterior Schwarzschild solution at the boundary. The radius of the star, R, is characterised as the radius where\ndensity \u03c1t (r = R) drops to 106 gm/cc (approximately O(10\u221210 ) in geometrised units).\nSchematically, equations (2.3) and (2.4) can be written as\nm\u03c1t\ndp\n= \u2212 2 (1 + A)(1 + B)(1 \u2212 C)\u22121 ,\ndr\nr\nm\nd\u03bd\n= 2 (1 + B)(1 \u2212 C)\u22121 .\ndr\nr\n\n(2.6)\n(2.7)\n\nAssuming that A, B and C are of comparable orders of smallness and making a Taylor series expansion in A, B, and\nC around the origin, the above equations to third post-Newtonian order then yield,\ndp\nm\u03c1t\nB + C} + |AB + BC {z\n= \u2212 2 (1 + A\n+ CA + C }2\n| + {z\ndr\nr\n1P N\n2\n\n2P N\n\n2\n\n3\n\n+ ABC + AC + BC + C +O(4) * * *) ,\n{z\n}\n|\n\n(2.8)\n\n3P N\n\nd\u03bd\nm\n+ C 2} + |BC 2{z+ C 3} +O(4) * * *) ,\n+ C} + |BC {z\n= 2 (1 + |B {z\ndr\nr\n1P N\n\n2P N\n\n(2.9)\n\n3P N\n\nwhere the post-Newtonian order of the relevant terms is indicated by the PN label under the braces. These equations\ndescribe the truncated post-Newtonian model [3]. Before proceeding ahead, we must verify that the above truncation\nis consistent and meaningful in the present problem of neutron stars. For a range of models, we evaluate the successive\ncombinations that appear in Eqs. (2.8) and (2.9), using the exact TOV equations. Figure 1 shows the combinations\nappearing in Eq. (2.8) for two such models with an equation of state of intermediate stiffness, one which is very close\nto the maximum mass limit and another, a little further down the stable branch. From the Figure it is clear that\nnumerically the successive combinations are perturbatively smaller to be consistently denoted as 1PN, 2PN and 3PN\ncontributions.\nIII. PAD\u00c9 APPROXIMANTS TO THE TRUNCATED POST-NEWTONIAN (TAYLOR) MODELS\n\nGiven a Taylor series of order n in one expansion parameter x\n2\n\n\fSn (x) = 1 + a1 x + * * * + an xn ,\n\n(3.1)\n\nits Pad\u00e9 approximant is the ratio of rational functions,\nPkm (x) =\n\nNm (x)\n,\nDk (x)\n\n(3.2)\n\nsatisfying the condition\nTn [Pkm (x)] \u2261 Sn (x);\n\nk + m = n.\n\n(3.3)\n\nIn the above, Nm and Dk are polynomials in x of order m and k respectively and Tn denotes the operation of\nexpanding a function in Taylor series upto order n.\nm\nA convenient choice of Pad\u00e9 approximants is its diagonal (or nearly diagonal) continued fraction form [8] i.e., Pm\nm\nwhen n = 2m (even) and Pm+1 when n = 2m + 1 (odd). For instance,\nP21 =\n\nc0\n,\nc1 x\n1+\nc2 x\n1+\n1 + c3 x\n\n(3.4)\n\nwhere the ci 's are determined in terms of the Taylor coefficients ai by\nc0 = 1, c1 = \u2212a1 , c2 =\n\na1 a3 \u2212 a22\na21 \u2212 a2\n, c3 =\n.\na1\na1 (a21 \u2212 a2 )\n\n(3.5)\n\nTo construct the Pad\u00e9 approximant of the truncated post-Newtonian models discussed in the previous section, we\nmust proceed carefully. In the problem under discussion, in general, there are three independent small parameters\nA, B, C, of the same order of smallness. Given this system of approximate differential equations containing three\nindependent small parameters, can we construct an associated Pad\u00e9 like approximation with faster and improved\nconvergence? Assume for a moment, that since A, B, C are of the same order of smallness, we decide to use as the\nvariable of expansion the parameter B that takes the maximum value in the entire range of integration. The first\norder Taylor term A + B + C would be rewritten as B(1 + A/B + C/B). If we treat only B as the independent variable\nthen its associated coefficient would be 1 + A/B + C/B. If A/B and C/B have only a weak dependence on r, we can\nindeed use a simpler Pad\u00e9 form with only one variable and this should suffice. We call this the one parameter Pad\u00e9\nform for the TOV equations. In this case, the relevant equations at 2PN are the following:1\ndm\n= 4\u03c0r2 \u03c1t ,\ndr\nm\u03c1t 1\ndp\n,\n=\u2212 2\ndr\nr F2\nd\u03bd\nm 1\n,\n= 2\ndr\nr G2\nA + B + C \u2212 AB \u2212 BC \u2212 CA \u2212 C 2\nwhere, F2 =\n,\nA + B + C + A2 + AB + CA + B 2 + BC\nB + C \u2212 BC \u2212 C 2\nand, G2 =\n.\nB + C + B 2 + BC\n\n(3.6a)\n(3.6b)\n(3.6c)\n(3.6d)\n(3.6e)\n\n(The more involved equations2 at 3PN are listed in the Appendix). To examine more quantitatively, the validity of\nthe above treatment, we consider, as before, a few models and compute the values of A, B and C and the associated\nratios of A/B and C/B. The results are displayed in Figure 2. From the figure it is clear, that as required, A, B, C\n\n1\n\nIdentical equations obtain if one uses any of A, B or C as the expansion parameter. It is also equivalent to introducing\nby hand a small parameter say \u03b5 in terms of which we (Taylor or Pad\u00e9) expand, treating as coefficients the associated A, B, C\ndependence.\n2\nThe explicit forms of F2 , G2 and the corresponding 3PN forms in the Appendix are exibited for analytical completeness. In\nour numerical computation however, we directly substitute Eqs. (3.4) and (3.5) in Eqs. (3.6b) and (3.6c).\n\n3\n\n\fare approximately of the same order of smallness. However, if one looks at the ratio of C/B, one finds that there is a\nregime where the r-dependence is not very weak. Consequently, we are wary of using only the usual straightforward\none parameter Pad\u00e9 form discussed above and proceed as follows. We generalise the usual construction for the one\nparameter Pad\u00e9 to the situation where there exist, not one, but three small parameters. The advantage of using a\nthree parameter form is that its 'coefficients' are pure numbers with no explicit 'r-dependence'. By treating A, B, C\nas independent variables, we avoid the explicit issue of the 'weak r-dependence' of the associated coefficients.3\nTo this end, we start with the most general second order post-Newtonian accurate polynomial in three small\nparameters A, B and C as\nT2 = 1 + tA A + tB B + tC C + tAA A2 + tBB B 2 + tCC C 2\n+tAB AB + tBC BC + tCA CA .\n\n(3.7)\n\nThe associated Pad\u00e9 approximant in continued fraction form may be chosen as\nP11 =\n\n1\n,\nF2\n\n(3.8)\n\nwhere\np1 A\n+\n1 + p11 A + p12 B + p13 C\np3 C\np2 B\n+\n.\n1 + p21 A + p22 B + p23 C\n1 + p31 A + p32 B + p33 C\n\nF2 = 1 +\n\n(3.9)\n\nBy matching coefficients of the Taylor expansion of P11 , Eq. (3.8), and T2 , Eq. (3.7), the three coefficients p1 , p2 and\np3 are uniquely determined as,\np1 = \u2212tA ; p2 = \u2212tB ; p3 = \u2212tC .\n\n(3.10)\n\nThe remaining nine coefficients pij , where i, j = 1, 2, 3, are not uniquely determined; they are solutions to the following\n(under-determined) system of six equations\ntA (tA \u2212 p11 ) = tAA ,\ntB (tB \u2212 p22 ) = tBB ,\ntC (tC \u2212 p33 ) = tCC ,\ntA p12 + tB p21 = 2tA tB \u2212 tAB ,\ntB p23 + tC p32 = 2tB tC \u2212 tBC ,\ntC p31 + tA p13 = 2tC tA \u2212 tCA .\n\n(3.11a)\n(3.11b)\n(3.11c)\n(3.11d)\n(3.11e)\n(3.11f)\n\nIf tA 6= 0, tB 6= 0, tC 6= 0, p11 , p22 and p33 , can also be uniquely determined using Eqs. (3.11a), (3.11b) and (3.11c)\nrespectively. We have\nt2A \u2212 tAA\n,\ntA\nt2 \u2212 tBB\n= B\n,\ntB\nt2 \u2212 tCC\n= C\n.\ntC\n\np11 =\n\n(3.12a)\n\np22\n\n(3.12b)\n\np33\n\n(3.12c)\n\nThe remaining six non-diagonal terms cannot be uniquely determined from the remaining three equations Eq. (3.11d)\n- (3.11f) without further input. The natural requirement that all Pad\u00e9 coefficients pij contributing to a particular\nTaylor term, contribute equally, leads one to the following symmetry choice\n\n3\n\nIndeed, one cannot relax this requirement in our three parameter construction either; however, this is only implicit in the\nfact that A, B, C are of the same order of smallness.\n\n4\n\n\fp12 = p21 , p23 = p32 , p13 = p31 .\n\n(3.13)\n\nOne can then uniquely determine all the required coefficients and finally obtain\n2tA tB \u2212 tAB\n, if tA + tB 6= 0,\ntA + tB\n2tB tC \u2212 tBC\n=\n, if tB + tC 6= 0,\ntB + tC\n2tC tA \u2212 tCA\n, if tC + tA 6= 0.\n=\ntC + tA\n\np12 = p21 =\n\n(3.14a)\n\np23 = p32\n\n(3.14b)\n\np31 = p13\n\n(3.14c)\n\nSince the form of Eq. (2.8) is equivalent to Eq. (3.7) and Eq. (2.7) has a less general form containing only 2-parameters\nB and C, the second order Pad\u00e9 approximant to the second order truncated TOV equations may be written as\ndm\n= 4\u03c0r2 \u03c1t ,\ndr\nm\u03c1t 1\ndp\n,\n=\u2212 2\ndr\nr F2\nd\u03bd\nm 1\n,\n= 2\ndr\nr G2\n\n(3.15)\n(3.16)\n(3.17)\n\nwhere F2 is given by Eq.

The 3PN three parameter Pad\u00e9 model may be similarly obtained but since the expressions are\nlengthier, we list them in the Appendix together with the one parameter 3PN Pad\u00e9 model.\nIV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nWe consider the polytropic equation of state p = K\u03c1\u0393 choosing the same models as studied by Shinkai [3] i.e.,\n\u0393 = 5/3, 2 and 3 with K (the polytropic constant) = 4.35, 102 and 105 , respectively. Before presenting the final results,\nwe have compared the performance of the one parameter Pad\u00e9 models with three parameter Pad\u00e9 models and display\nin Figure 3 a typical comparison. From the Figure it is clear that both models yield similar numerical performance\nand the difference, if any, appears in the region where anyway these models are not recommended. Consequently, all\nour Figures refer to the one parameter Pad\u00e9 models though we have verified that the three parameter Pad\u00e9 models\nalso yield similar results.\nIn Fig. 4, we plot mass (in solar mass units) as a function of central density. The different curves represent the\nexact TOV, the 2PN and 3PN truncated (Taylor) models (henceforth 2-Taylor, 3-Taylor etc; for more details, see\n[3]) and our new Pad\u00e9 approximated models. We do not plot curves corresponding to 1PN truncated Taylor and the\nassociated first order Pad\u00e9 model as they are very far away from the exact GR curve and thus evidently inadequate.\n5\n\n\fIt is very clear from the figure that for all models to the left of the (first) maximum, which represents the stable\nbranch of the mass-density curve, the Pad\u00e9 models do extremely well as compared to Taylor models. In this regime\nthe third order Pad\u00e9 (now onwards 3-Pad\u00e9) curve (dashed line) is very close to the exact GR curve (solid line). The\n2-Pad\u00e9 (long-dashed line) curve is not only better compared to the 2-Taylor one (dot-dashed) but even far better than\nthe 3-Taylor curve (dotted line). In the unstable branch i.e., to the right to the maximum, the Pad\u00e9 approximation\nstarts becoming bad. This feature is more severe when the stiffness of the considered equation of state and the order\nof the Pad\u00e9 approximants are higher4 (Fig. 4b and c). However, the stable branch is approximated well by Pad\u00e9\nmodels even for a very stiff equation of state (\u0393 = 3, Fig. 4c), where the approximation breaks down near (2.75 x\n1015 g/cm3 ) the maximum mass limit (1.85 x 1015 g/cm3 ). Studies of mass-radius curves and \u03bdc (the exponent of\nthe metric component gtt at the center of the star) vs central density curves also show a similar dependence on the\nstiffness of the chosen equation of state and on the central density. In Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, we plot mass vs radius and\n\u03bdc vs central density curves respectively, for an equation of state with intermediate stiffness \u0393 = 2. The deviation of\nthe 3-Pad\u00e9 solutions from the exact GR ones correspond to the configurations lying on the unstable branch.\nThe studies of these equilibrium configurations imply clearly that the stable general relativistic TOV configurations\nare approximated very well by Pad\u00e9 models as compared to Taylor truncated models, even if they do not perform so\nwell in the unstable branch. To study this further, we next numerically evolve these five initial configurations - Exact\nTOV, 2-Pad\u00e9, 3-Pad\u00e9, 2-Taylor and 3-Taylor truncated models - in time and qualitatively compare their evolution.\nWe use a spherically symmetric general relativistic hydrodynamical code for this purpose [9]. The code uses polar\nslicing and radial gauge. The spacetime is evolved using the ADM formalism and the hydrodynamic evolution is based\non a high resolution shock capturing [10]- [11] scheme. The grid boundary is fixed at about four times the radius of\nthe TOV model. We choose a model with central density 1.28 x 10\u22123 (geometrised units), \u0393 = 2, k = 102 and then\nevolve it upto 10 ms (though the code runs for a much longer time, 10 ms evolution is sufficient for our analysis). In\nFig. 7 the evolution of central density using various initial data is displayed. We find that the 3-Pad\u00e9 curve follows\nthe TOV evolution curve very closely. Even the 2-Pad\u00e9 evolution is much better than the 3-Taylor and the 2-Taylor\nevolutions. The oscillations in the central density are due to the numerical truncation errors which introduce non-zero\nradial velocity. These truncation errors act as the small perturbations on a stable spherically symmetric configuration\nand give rise to the radial pulsation modes of the system. A Fourier transform of the density or radial velocity\nevolution can be used to extract these pulsation modes [12] and we hope to return to this in a subsequent work. In\nFig. 8 we plot the metric components gtt and grr over the grid for t = 0 (initial time) and t = 10 ms (final time). To\ncompare the global performance of the initial data used (the exact TOV and the various truncated models), the norms\nof the Hamiltonian constraints l\u221e (maximum value at a given time step) and  \u0304l1 (average of the absolute value) are\nevaluated and shown in Fig. 9. These figures, once again, confirm the superior performance of Pad\u00e9 approximants over\nTaylor approximants of the same order. Though we do not display them, we get similar results for the other stable\nconfigurations both for relatively softer and stiffer equations of state. A final comment on the models in the unstable\nbranch of the mass-density curve: the truncation errors are enough to trigger a collapse and make the system unstable\non a time scale so short that a comparison of various approximations is not possible. A more detailed analysis would\nbe needed in this regard.\nTo conclude: Detailed studies of equilibrium configurations of single neutron stars and their evolution indicate, that\nin the stable branch, the second order Pad\u00e9 model converges to the exact general relativistic model even better than\nthe straightforward third order truncated (Taylor) PN model. Both the simpler one parameter Pad\u00e9 form and a more\ninvolved three parameter Pad\u00e9 form exhibit similar improvement over the Taylor models. The Pad\u00e9 models are thus\nquite robust and controlled and perform better than the simpler Taylor truncated models. It is better to use initial\ndata obtained from a Pad\u00e9 approximant to the Taylor model than initial data from a straightforward post-Newtonian\ntruncated model of the same order. This feature should be generic and extend to binary neutron stars and black holes\n[especially since a useful simplification in a two-body problem is via a reduction to an equivalent one-body problem]\nand prove useful in numerical studies of such systems in the future.\n\n4\n\nWhile computing the PN coefficients in Eq. (2.8) for the models which fall in the unstable branch, we notice that the values\nfor the 1PN terms become even greater than one, indicating that neither the Taylor truncation nor the Pad\u00e9 expansion is\nreliable in this region. For the stable branch models these coefficients are always lesser than one as shown in Fig. 1.\n\n6\n\n\fACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nA.
