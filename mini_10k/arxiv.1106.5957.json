The system is an High mass X-ray binary (HMXB) that contains an X-ray pulsar\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: seyda@astroa.physics.metu.edu.tr (\u015e\u015e); inam@baskent.edu.tr (S\u00c7\u0130); altan@astroa.physics.metu.edu.tr (AB)\n\n\f2\n\n\u015e. \u015eahiner, S. \u00c7. \u0130nam and A. Baykal\n\naccreting material from its blue supergiant companion star. The pulsar has an eccentric (e\n\u223c 0.28) orbit around its companion and the orbital period of the binary system is \u223c8.3753\ndays (In't Zand et al. 1998).\nThe orbital profile of 4U 1907+09 exhibits two flares per orbit separated by \u2243 0.5 orbital\nphase; a large primary at the periastron and the small secondary at the apastron (Marshall\n& Ricketts 1980, In't Zand et al. 1998). The presence of the two phase-locked flares had\nled to the suggestion that the compact object passes through a circumstellar disk of matter\naround the equatorial plane of a Be type stellar companion (Iye 1986, Cook & Page 1987).\nHowever the position of 4U 1907+09 in the Corbet diagram (Corbet 1984) indicates that the\ncompanion is probably an OB type supergiant. Latest optical (Cox et al. 2005) and infrared\n(Nespoli et al. 2008) observations actually showed that the companion could be classifed as\nan O8 - O9 Ia supergiant with a mass loss rate of \u1e40 = 7 \u00d7 10\u22126 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , and a lower limit\nof distance \u223c5 kpc.\nThe spin period of 4U 1907+09 was first measured as \u223c437.5 s using Tenma observations\n(Makishima et al. 1984). The pulse profile is known to be double peaked with variable\namplitude. The profile is insensitive to the energies below 20 keV, whereas dramatic changes\nare present above 20 keV (In't Zand et al. 1998). Historical period measurements confirm\nthat the pulsar had been steadily spinning down since its discovery until 1998 with an average\nrate of \u03bd\u0307 = \u22123.54 \u00d7 10\u221214 Hz s\u22121 (Cook & Page 1987, In't Zand et al. 1998, Baykal et al.\n2001, Mukerjee et al. 2001). Afterwards, RXTE observations in 2001 showed that the spin\nrate was lowered by a factor of \u223c0.60 (Baykal et al. 2006). From INTEGRAL observations,\nit was reported that the spin period had reached to a maximum of \u223c441.3 s then, a torque\nreversal occurred and the source began to spin up with a rate of 2.58 \u00d7 10\u221214 Hz s\u22121 after\n2004 May (Fritz et al. 2006). Recent measurements with RXTE presented in \u0130nam et al.\n(2009a) and this paper have revealed that 4U 1907+09 has returned spin down trend with\na rate of \u22123.59 \u00d7 10\u221214 Hz s\u22121 , which is close to the previous steady spin down rate. This\nimplies that another torque reversal should have been taken place before 2007 June.\n4U 1907+09 was identified as a variable X-ray source showing irregular flaring and dipping activities, \u223c20% observations of which were reported to be in dip state with no detectable pulsed emission (In't Zand et al. 1997). The typical duration of the dips was found\nto vary between few minutes to 1.5 hours. Variations in the X-ray flux were accepted to be\nthe evidences of instability in the mass accretion rate where the dipping states are associated\nwith the cessation of the accretion from an inhomogeneous wind of the companion star.\n\n\fThe X-ray Pulsar 4U 1907+09\n\n3\n\nX-ray spectra of 4U 1907+09 were basically described by a power law with photon index\n\u223c1.2 and an exponential cutoff at \u223c13 keV (Schwartz et al. 1980, Marshall & Ricketts 1980,\nMakishima et al. 1984, Cook & Page 1987, Chitnis et al. 1993, Roberts et al. 2001, Coburn\net al. 2002, Baykal et al. 2006, Fritz et al. 2006). The continuum was found to be modified\nby highly variable Hydrogen column density (nH ) over the binary orbit, between 1 \u00d7 1022\ncm\u22122 and 9 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 as a consequence of inhomogeneous accretion via dense stellar wind\n(In't Zand et al. 1997). A narrow spectral line around 6.4 keV corresponding to Fe K\u03b1\nemission produced by the fluorescence of matter surrounding the pulsar was also observed\nin the spectra. The detailed determination of Fe K emission complex has been recently\nreported using Suzaku observations, wherein Fe K\u03b2 emission has been detected for the first\ntime (Rivers et al. 2010). Observations with Ginga (Mihara 1995, Makishima et al. 1999)\nand BeppoSAX (Cusumano et al. 1998) exhibited cyclotron resonant scattering features\n(CRSFs) at higher energies. Line energies of the fundamental and the second harmonic\ncyclotron lines were found to be \u223c19 keV and \u223c39 keV respectively, implying a surface\nmagnetic field strength of 2.1 \u00d7 1012 G (Cusumano et al. 1998).\nIn this paper, we present timing and spectral analysis of RXTE monitoring observations\nof 4U 1907+09 between 2007 June and 2011 March. Selected INTEGRAL pointing observations are analyzed to cover the gap in spin period history. We describe the observations\nin Section 2. Pulse timing analysis is reported in Section 3. In Section 4, spectral results are\ndiscussed. In Section 5, we focus on the dipping states of the source. Finally, we summarize\nour results in Section 6.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nOBSERVATIONS\nRXTE\n\nOne of the main instruments on-board RXTE is the Proportional Counter Array (PCA)\nwhich consists of five co-aligned identical proportional counter units (PCUs) pointed to the\nsame location in the sky (Jahoda et al. 1996). The field of view (FOV) of PCA at full width at\nhalf maximum (FWHM) is about 1\u25e6 and the effective area of each detector is approximately\n1300 cm2 . PCA operates in the energy range 2 - 60 keV with an energy resolution of 18%\nat 6 keV.\nIn this paper, we present timing and spectral analysis of 98 pointed RXTE -PCA observations of 4U 1907+09 between 2007 June and 2011 March each with an exposure of\n\n\f4\n\n\u015e. \u015eahiner, S. \u00c7. \u0130nam and A.

(2009a).\nPreliminary timing analysis results were presented before by \u015eahiner et al. (2011).\n\n\u223c2 ks (see Table 1). Preliminary timing analysis were already performed and corresponding\nspin-rate measurements were presented before by \u0130nam et al. (2009a) and \u015eahiner et al.\n(2011). In this paper, we extend this analysis by using observations with a longer time span\nand performing a more detailed timing analysis as well as presenting our spectral analysis\nresults.\nAlthough number of active PCUs during the observations of 4U 1907+09 varies between\none and three, data obtained from PCUs 0 and 1 are not appropriate for spectral analysis due\nto increased background levels as a result of the loss of their propane layers. Consequently,\nthe only data products taken into consideration during spectral analysis belong to PCU 2 in\norder to avoid probable problems due to calibration differences between the detectors. The\nloss of propane layers of PCU 0 and PCU 1 do not affect high resolution timing, therefore\nno PCU selection is done for the timing analysis.\nThe standard software tools of HEASOFT v.6.10 are used for the analysis of PCA data.\nFilter files are produced to apply constraints on the data such that; the times when elevation\nangle is less than 10\u25e6 , offset from the source is greater than 0.02\u25e6 and electron contamination\nof PCU2 is greater than 0.1 are excluded. Data modes examined for the spectral and light\ncurve extraction are 'Standard2f' and 'GoodXenon' modes respectively. Background spectra\nand light curves are generated by the latest PCA background estimator models supplied by\nthe RXTE Guest Observer Facility (GOF) , Epoch 5C.\n2.2\n\nINTEGRAL\n\nThe INTEGRAL observations analysed in this paper are obtained from the INTEGRAL\nScience Data Centre (ISDC) archive. All publicly available pointing observations subsequent\nto the previous study of 4U 1907+09 (Fritz et al. 2006) are selected considering the good\nIBIS-ISGRI times to be above 1 ks. Selected observations, in which the source is in the FOV\nwith an off-set angle smaller than 5\u25e6 , are held on between 2005 October and 2007 November.\n\n\f5\n\n\u22121\n\u22121.5\n\nlog(Power)\n\n\u22122\n\n1\n\n\u22122.5\n\n0.8\n0.6\n\nNormalized count rate\n\n1.2\n\n\u22120.5\n\nThe X-ray Pulsar 4U 1907+09\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n0.6\nPulse Phase\n\n0.8\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n0.6\nlog(Harmonic Number)\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nFigure 1.

Imager on Board the INTEGRAL Satellite (IBIS) is a coded mask instrument,\nwhich has a fully coded FOV of 8\u25e6 .3 \u00d7 8\u25e6 .0 and 12\u2032 angular resolution (FWHM) (Ubertini et\nal. 2003). INTEGRAL Soft Gamma-Ray Imager (ISGRI) is the upper layer of the IBIS instrument which operates in the energy range 15 keV - 1 MeV with an energy resolution of 8%\nat 60 keV (Lebrun et al. 2003). The data reduction is performed by the software OSA v.7.0.\nThe standard pipeline processing comprises gain correction, good-time handling, dead-time\nderivation, background correction and energy reconstruction. Images in two energy bands\n(20 - 40 keV and 40 - 60 keV) are produced from IBIS-ISGRI data with the use of an input\ncatalogue consisting strong sources in the FOV: Ser X-1, XTE J1855-026, 4U 1909+07, SS\n433, IGR J19140+0951, GRS 1915+105 and 4U 1907+09. The background maps provided\nby the ISGRI team are used for background correction. Light curves are created by the tool\nII_LIGHT which allows high resolution timing.\n\n\f6\n\n\u015e. \u015eahiner, S. \u00c7. \u0130nam and A.

These background subtracted light curves are corrected to the barycenter of\nthe solar system. Then we correct the light curves for the binary motion of 4U 1907+09\nusing the binary orbital parameters (In't Zand et al. 1998). Since 4U 1907+09 has many\ndips, we eliminate these dips from the light curve. Pulse periods for 4U 1907+09 are found\nby folding the time series on statistically independent trial periods (Leahy et al. 1983).\nTemplate pulse profiles are constructed from these observations by folding the data on the\nperiod giving maximum \u03c72 . The pulse profiles consist of 20 phase bins and are represented\nby their Fourier harmonics (Deeter & Boynton 1985). We present a sample template pulse\nprofile and its power spectra in terms of harmonic number in Figure 1.\nThe pulse arrival times are obtained from the cross-correlation between template and\npulse profiles obtained in each \u223c2 ks observation. We have been able to connect all pulse\narrival times of RXTE observations in phase over a 1300 day time span. In the phase\nconnection procedure, in order to avoid cycle count ambiguity, we construct the pulse arrival\ntimes for a time span where the maximum phase shift is less then 1. This time scale for 4U\n1907+09 is around 160 days. We divide total time span into 10 time intervals intervals each\naround 160 days and construct the pulse arrival times with respect to the best period in\nthat time interval. Then, we align the slopes of pulse arrival times in the overlapping time\nintervals and construct pulse arrival times as presented in the upper panel of Figure 2.\n\n\fThe X-ray Pulsar 4U 1907+09\n\n7\n\nWe fit the pulse arrival times to the fifth order polynomial,\n5\nX\n1 dn \u03c6\n(t \u2212 to )n\n\u03b4\u03c6 = \u03b4\u03c6o + \u03b4\u03bd(t \u2212 to ) +\nn\nn! dt\nn=2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b4\u03c6 is the pulse phase offset deduced from the pulse timing analysis, to is the mid-time;\n\u03b4\u03c6o is the residual phase offset at to ; \u03b4\u03bd is the correction to the pulse frequency at time t0 ;\ndn \u03c6\ndtn\n\nfor n=2,3,4,5 are the first, second, third and fourth order derivatives of the pulse phase.\nThe pulse arrival times (pulse cycles) and the residuals of the fit after the removal of the\n\nfifth order polynomial trend are presented in Figure 2. Table 2 presents the timing solution\nof 4U 1907+09 between MJD 54280 and 55600. It should be noted that we also obtained\npulse residuals by performing pulse timing analysis using the timing solution parameters for\npulse frequency and its time derivatives given in Table 2.\nIn order to obtain pulse frequencies, we fit a linear model to each successive pairs of\narrival times. Slopes of these linear fits lead us to estimate the pulse frequency values at\nmid-time of corresponding observations. In Figure 3 and Table 3, we present the pulse\nperiod history of the source. In order to check the reliability of pulse arrival times, we also\nobtained the pulse periods using the slopes of pulse arrivals times obtained from 160-day\ntime intervals. We found exactly the same pulse periods as obtained from the arrival times\nof 1300 days time span. Using the pulse periods, we obtained the pulse frequency value of\n\u03bd\u0307 = \u22123.672(1) \u00d7 10\u221214 Hz s\u22121 for a time span of \u223c1300 days . This is also consistent with\nthe timing solution in Table 2.\nFor the timing analysis of INTEGRAL observations, we extract 10 s binned background\ncorrected IBIS-ISGRI light curves in the energy range 20 - 40 keV. We sample light curves\nfrom \u223c 7 \u2212 10 days time span and find the best pulse frequency by folding the light curve\non statistically independent pulse frequencies. Then constructing master and sample pulse\nprofiles, we obtain pulse arrival times as described above. From the slopes of pulse arrival\ntimes (\u03b4\u03c6 = \u03b4\u03bd(t \u2212 to )) we attain the correction for pulse frequencies. We present pulse\nfrequencies measured from RXTE -PCA and INTEGRAL IBIS-ISGRI observations in Figure\n3 and Table 3.\n\n3.2\n\nTorque Noise Strength\n\nIn order to see the statistical trend of the pulse frequency derivatives, we construct power\nspectrum of the pulse frequency derivatives.

This technique uses the polynomial\nestimators instead of sinusoidal estimate for each time scale T .\nThe power density spectra can be expressed by applying sampling function to the pulse\narrival times (Deeter 1984; for the applications see Bildsten et al. (1997) and Baykal et al.\nR\u221e\n(2007)). The power density estimator P\u03bd\u0307 (f ) is defined as 0 P\u03bd\u0307 (f )df =< (\u03bd\u0307\u2212 < \u03bd\u0307 >)2 >\nwhere < \u03bd\u0307 > is the mean pulse frequency derivative for a given analysis frequency. In\norder to estimate the power density, we first divide pulse arrival times into time spans\nof duration T and fit cubic polynomial in time. The observed time series is simulated by\nMonte Carlo techniques for a unit white noise strength defined as P\u03bd\u0307 (f ) = 1 and fitted to a\ncubic polynomial in time. Then the square of the third order polynomial term was divided\ninto the value from Monte Carlo simulations (Deeter 1984, Cordes 1980). The logarithmic\naverage of these estimators over the same time intervals is the power density estimate.\nThis procedure is repeated for different durations T to obtain a power spectrum. We also\ncalculated power density with quartic polynomial estimator and found consistent power\ndensity spectra with the cubic polynomial estimator. The frequency response of each power\ndensity and measurement noise estimates are presented at f \u223c 1/T . In Figure 4, we present\npower of pulse frequency derivatives (P\u03bd\u0307 (f )) per Hertz as a function of analysis frequency\nf . The slope of the power spectrum between 1/1300 and 1/75 d\u22121 is flat. This suggests\nthat fluctuations in the pulse frequency derivatives are white noise and the pulse frequency\n\n\fThe X-ray Pulsar 4U 1907+09\n\n9\n\nTable 3.

In these systems red noise in pulse frequency can\nnot be ruled out (Bildsten et al. 1997). For disc accretors, Cen X-3 have red noise in pulse\nfrequency derivatives, noise strength varies from low to high frequencies as 10\u221216 , 10\u221218 Hz\ns\u22122 (Bildsten et al. 1997). Power law index of power spectra in this system is \u223c \u22121. This\nimplies that, at short time scales, disc accretion is dominated and noise is less, on the other\nhand at time scales longer than viscous time scales there are excessive noise.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nSPECTRAL ANALYSIS\nOrbital Phase Resolved Spectra with RXTE -PCA\n\nThe RXTE observations of 4U 1907+09 were proposed with a time distribution such that\nthey spread over a variety of orbital phases, therefore they are very suitable for the investigation of the variation in the spectral parameters through the binary orbit. During the\nanalysis of PCA spectra energy range is restricted to 3 - 25 keV since the count statistics is\npoor beyond this range. The spectral analysis is carried out by using the XSPEC v.12.6.0\nsoftware. A systematic error of 2% is applied to handle the uncertainties in the response\nmatrices and in background modelling (Wilms et al. 1999).\n4U 1907+09 is near the Galactic plane and the supernova remnant W49B, therefore an\nextra process is needed for a correct estimation of the background spectra. The exceptional\ndipping states of the source provide a good basis for background estimation since the count\nrates are consistent with the Galactic ridge emission (Roberts et al. 2001, Baykal et al. 2006).\n4U 1907+09 is detected to be in the dipping state in about 55 ks of the 216 ks RXTE -PCA\n\n\fThe X-ray Pulsar 4U 1907+09\n\n11\n\nnH (1022 cm\u22122)\n\n3\u221225 keV Unabs.

The overall dipping state spectrum is used as an additional background, the\nprocedure was explained before by \u0130nam et al. (2009a).\nA total of 71 non-dip spectra of 4U 1907+09 are analysed for the orbital variation of\nthe spectral parameters. Results of first 19 spectra were also given in the previous paper\n(\u0130nam et al. 2009a). The basic model which consists of a power law (powerlaw) with a\nhigh energy cutoff (highecut) and photoelectric absorption (wabs) is successful for only 10\nspectra, where as an additional model component for the CRSF around 19 keV is required\nfor the rest. We use cyclabs model in XSPEC (Mihara et al. 1990 and Makishima et al.\n1990). The fundamental line energy is fixed at 18.9 keV due to the statistical insignificance\nof individual PCA spectra with short exposure time ( \u223c2 ks) and the mean values of the\ndepth and the width of the line are found as 0.4 keV and 1.7 keV respectively. These values\nare used to model CRSF since they agree within 1 \u03c3 uncertainty with the previous CRSF\nparameters (Mihara 1995, Cusumano et al. 1998 and Makishima et al. 1999). Addition of a\nmodel component for the weak Fe emission line at 6.4 keV did not improve our fits, since\nthis feature had lost its strength after subtraction of the diffuse emission from the Galactic\nridge.\nOrbital variations of unabsorbed flux at 3 - 25 keV, Hydrogen column density (nH ) and\n\n\f12\n\n\u015e. \u015eahiner, S. \u00c7. \u0130nam and A. Baykal\n\nphoton index are plotted in Figure 5, which is an updated version of Figure 5 in \u0130nam et al.\n(2009a). The variability of nH over the binary orbit is evident in the third panel of Figure\n5. The base value of nH is \u223c 2 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 . It increases up to a value of \u223c 10.5 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122\njust after the periastron passage (indicated by the vertical dash lines) and it remains at high\nvalues until the apastron, where it reduces to its base value again. 9 of our individual nH\nmeasurements exceed previously reported maximal value (\u223c 9 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 , In't Zand et al.\n1997). Similar orbital dependence of nH was also reported for the source before (Roberts\net al. 2001). One can see that there is no significant orbital variation of photon index in\nthe bottom panel of Figure 5, the mean value is \u223c1.1. Other parameters that are consistent\nwith being constant through the orbit are high energy cutoff and exponential folding energy\nwith the mean values 12.7 keV and 9.6 keV respectively.\nIn some accretion powered pulsars (e.g. Vela X-1 (Haberl & White 1990)) nH is highly\nvariable over the orbital phases and can range up to \u223c1023 - 1024 cm\u22122 . This variation\nis a probe to the density distribution of the accreting matter. The observed increase in\nabsorption at periastron passage or eclipse ingress may be due to a gas stream from the\ncompanion trailing behind the pulsar (Haberl et al. 1989). In the case of 4U 1907+09, nH\nincreasing to its maximum value after the periastron passage implies that the location of the\nabsorbing material is the dense stellar wind of the companion star (Roberts et al 2001). Leahy\n(2001) and Kostka & Leahy (2010) modeled the absorption profile according to theoretical\nwind models and they have proposed that the most probable mechanism for 4U 1907+09\nis accretion from a spherical wind with equatorially enhanced dense spiral stream of gas\naround the companion star.\n\n4.2\n\nX-ray Flux Dependence of Spectral Parameters\n\nTo look for the X-ray flux dependence of spectral parameters of the source, we use spectral\nparameters and X-ray flux values obtained from 71 spectra that are presented in Section\n4.1. We sorted observations according to the X-ray flux values and spectral parameters of\nthe observations with similar X-ray flux values are averaged to obtain a spectral parameter\nset as a function of X-ray flux. It should be noted that range of each flux value over which\nthe spectral parameters are averaged is represented as x-axis error bars of the data points in\nFigure 6. We find that no spectral parameters except power law index show any correlation\n\n\fThe X-ray Pulsar 4U 1907+09\n\n13\n\nPhoton Index\n\n1.3\n\n1.2\n\n1.1\n\n1\n\n0.9\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n6\n8\n10\n3\u221225 keV Unabs.

Whereas power law index is found to be correlated\nwith the X-ray flux (see Figure 6).\nCorrelation between power law index and X-ray flux is an indication of spectral hardening\nwith decreasing X-ray flux. Similar correlation has been seen in the accretion powered pulsars\nV0332+53 (Klochkov et al. 2011), 4U 0115+63 (Klochkov et al. 2011), 4U 1626-67 (Jain\net al. 2010) and Vela X-1 (F\u00fcrst et al. 2009). On the other hand, there are also some\naccretion powered pulsars that exhibit spectral softening with decreasing X-ray flux: Her\nX-1 (Kolochkov et al. 2011), Swift J1626.6-5156 (\u0130\u00e7dem et al. 2011), XMMU J054134.7682550 (\u0130nam et al. 2009b), 2S 1417-62 (\u0130nam et al. 2004) and SAX J2103.5+4545 (Baykal\net al. 2007). Both correlation and anti-correlation of power law index with X-ray flux might\nbe considered as results of mass accretion rate variations and/or inhomogeneities in the\ncompanion's wind.\n\n5\n\nDIPPING STATES AND PULSE-TO-PULSE VARIABILITY\n\nSince 4U 1907+09 is known to be a variable X-ray source, we analysed light curve of each\nRXTE -PCA observation to investigate pulse-to-pulse variations.The source is known to have\ndipping episodes that show no pulsations (In't Zand et al. 1997); therefore we searched for\nirregularities of pulsations due to dipping ingress and egress. Although short exposure time\n(\u223c2 ks) of RXTE observations allow us to see at most about five successive pulses, we were\nable to detect a variety of rapid pulse shape changes.\nIn Figure 7, an example of a pulsating and dipping light curve of 4U 1907+09 is given in\npanel (a). Generally, the pulse-to-pulse X-ray intensity decreases just before dipping ingress\n\n\f14\n\n\u015e. \u015eahiner, S. \u00c7. \u0130nam and A.

Time values are converted to phases (or time/pulse period) for\narbitarly observation epochs. Explanations to each panel are given in Section 5. Observation IDs of panels from top to bottom are\na:94036-01-19-00, b:96366-02-01-00, c:94036-01-05-00, d:94036-01-23-00, e:94036-01-13-00, f:93036-01-20-00, g:94036-01-03-00,\nh:93036-01-34-00, i:93036-01-38-00 and j:95350-01-06-00.\n\n\fThe X-ray Pulsar 4U 1907+09\n\n15\n\n(see panel (b)) and it increases gradually after the dipping egress (see panel (c)). However\nthis is not the case for every dipping episode. The light curve in panel (d) is an extreme\nexample, in which an X-ray flare follows a dipping episode and after a smooth decrease for\ntwo pulses, the source undergoes another dip again. Although the pulse shape is conserved in\nthese primary examples, we find that it can also be totally disrupted by the dip, e.g. in panel\n(e) the pulse shape transforms to a single broad peak after a one pulse long dip and in panel\n(f) the attached wide peaks of the faint pulse are converted into detached sharp peaks after\nthe dip. The beginning of the light curve in panel (f) is also an example of unsuccessful dip\nwhich may be observed occasionally (see also In't Zand et al. 1997). In panel (g), single peak\npulses are observable before and after the 1.5 phase long dip. In panel (h), after two broad\npulses a dipping episode starts on phase 2.6 and continues until the end of the observation.\nA very rare condition is the total disappearance of only one peak of the pulse in panel (i),\nthis example is the shortest dip we observe (between phases 2.9 and 3.4). We observe one\npulse dips more commonly e.g. in panel (j) the dip between phases 1.8 and 2.8.\nDipping states observed in Vela X-1 (Kreykenbohm et al. 2008) have no identifiable\ntransition phase in spectra before or after the dip. However, a recent study of GX 301-2\n(G\u00f6\u011f\u00fc\u015f et al. 2011) reported a spectral softening starting before the dip. The photon index\nvalues reaching maximum during the peculiar dip of GX 301-2 resumes its normal values\nimmediately after the dip. F\u00fcrst et al. (2011) studied a dip spectra of GX 301-2 and found\nthat although the pulses cease almost completely, nH does not show any significant variation.\nIn the case of 4U 1907+09, direct spectral study of the dips with RXTE is not possible due to\nthe diffuse galactic emission background, since the source is below the detection threshold\nand the dip spectra are similar to the Galactic Ridge spectra. However, it appears from\nFigure 8 that the source may be observed in dipping state in every orbital phase except\nbetween the phases 0.7 - 0.8 . Comparing this result with the spectral results of non-dipping\nobservations (see Figure 5); the absence of dips matches with the orbital phases when nH\nreaches to its maximum value just after the periastron passage (see lower panel of Figure 8).\nMoreover, the possibility of dipping is less in orbital phases from 0.8 to 1.1 when compared to\nphases from 0.1 to 0.6; which is in anti-correlation with the nH values. The source frequently\nundergoes in dipping state during the times with minimum nH and the possibility peaks\nbetween the phases 0.4 - 0.5. It is important to note that this is not a strong conclusion,\nsince direct measurement of the spectral parameters of the dips is not possible for us.\nRecently, strongly structured wind of the optical companion is accused of being the\n\n\f16\n\n\u015e. \u015eahiner, S. \u00c7. \u0130nam and A. Baykal\n\nreason of the dips in HMXB light curves. The clumpy wind of the companion, being highly\ninhomogeneous, creates regions of different density. Recent models have shown that the\ndensity of the wind material can change up to several orders of magnitude (Runacres &\nOwocki 2005). Therefore, a sudden decrease of X-ray luminosity is caused by the decrease\nin mass accretion rate. As the accretion rate decreases the Alfv\u00e9n radius increases and\naccretion stops when the source enters to propeller regime. Hence, the disappearance of\npulsations can be explained by the passage of the pulsar through low density regions of the\nwind. The limit to the luminosity that turn on the propeller mechanism can be derived from\nthe condition where the magnetospheric radius is equal to the co-rotation radius (Illarionov\n& Sunyaev 1975) and it is 6 \u00d7 1031 erg s\u22121 for the case of 4U 1907+09. Therefore, the\ndipping states are candidate episodes for propeller regime since the count rates are below\ndetection threshold. Similar propeller transition is suggested as the cause of observed dips\nin the accretion powered pulsars GX 1+4 and GRO J1744-28 (Cui 1997).\n\nThe dipping episodes of 4U 1907+09 are known to have irregular time coverage, with\nvarying duration. We investigate the distribution of dipping states through the orbital phase.\nAbout 46 of the 98 observations include dipping states. The percentage of exposure time\nspend in dipping is \u223c28% of the total exposure. In order to obtain the orbital distribution\nof dipping states, we calculate the percentage of the dip exposure to total exposure corresponding to each orbital phase with 0.1 phase resolution. The variation of the dip exposure\npercentage on orbital phase is plotted together with folded ASM light curve at orbital period\nat Figure 8. It is clearly seen that the occurrence of dips sharply decreases during the periastron passage and after the passage. Around the periastron passage, ASM count rate and\ntherefore X-ray flux increases, whereas number of dip states decreases. It should be kept in\nour mind that a transient QPO had been found during one of the flares which suggests the\nformation of a transient disc (Int Zand et al. 1997). This implies that the number of occurrences of dip states is less at the periastron passage and afterwards since the disc accretion\nis dominant mechanism. After the apastron (phases from 0.1 to 0.5), number of dip states\nincreases due to the clumpy nature of accretion and occurrence of transient propeller regime\nepisodes increases. The latter naturally explains the variable nature of the spin down. The\ncombination of disc and wind accretion at different phases of orbit may lead to random walk\nnature of pulse frequency time series.\n\n\fThe X-ray Pulsar 4U 1907+09\n\n17\n\n(cts s\u22121)\n\nASM Count Rate\n\n2\n1.5\n1\n\nDip Exposure\n\nPercentage (%)\n\n0.5\n60\n40\n20\n0\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\nOrbital Phase (T\u03c0/2 = 0)\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nFigure 8.

The data points are repeated for a cycle for clarity. The vertical dashed lines correspond\nto time of periastron passage within 1 \u03c3. It is evident that probability of observing a dipping state is lower during periastron\npassage and afterwards (between orbital phases 0.6 and 0.9).\n\n6\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn this paper, we present analysis of INTEGRAL IBIS-ISGRI (between 2005 October and\n2007 November) and RXTE -PCA (between 2007 June and 2011 March) observations of the\naccretion powered pulsar 4U 1907+09.\nUsing INTEGRAL and RXTE observations, we report new pulse period measurements\nand obtain an updated version of the pulse period history of \u0130nam et al. (2009a) which is\nshown in Figure 3. Using these measurements, we construct power spectrum density of the\npulse frequencies (see Figure 4). We find that fluctuations in the pulse frequency derivatives\nare white noise and the pulse frequency fluctuations are consistent with the random walk\nmodel. The noise strength is found to be 1.27 \u00d7 10\u221221 Hz s\u22122 . We infer that in short time\nscales, there may be transient disc formation around the neutron star which causes random\nwalk in the pulse frequency while in the long term the spin down rate is steady.\nFrom the X-ray spectral analysis of RXTE -PCA observations, we find that only Hydrogen column density (nH ) is significantly variable over the binary orbit, tending to increase\njust after the periastron passage (see Figure 5). This might indicate that the location of\nthe absorbing material is the dense stellar wind of the companion star. We also study flux\ndependence of spectral parameters and find that power law index show correlation with the\n3-25 keV unabsorbed X-ray flux indicating spectral hardening with decreasing X-ray flux\n(see Figure 6). This spectral variation might be related to mass accretion rate variations\nand/or inhomogeneities in the companion's wind.\nWe also look for the irregularities of pulsations near dipping ingress and egress (see\n\n\f18\n\n\u015e. \u015eahiner, S. \u00c7. \u0130nam and A. Baykal\n\nFigure 7). We propose that the disappearance of pulsations can be explained by the passage\nof the pulsar through low density regions of the clumpy wind which may lead to a turn-on\nof a temporary propeller state so that the X-ray luminosity decreases below the detection\nthreshold. We are able to analyse orbital dependence of the dip state occurrences (see Figure\n8). We find that the source more likely undergoes in dipping state after the apastron until\nthe periastron where transitions to temporary propeller state might occur due to accretion\nfrom clumpy wind.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nWe acknowledge support from T\u00dcB\u0130TAK, the Scientific and Technological Research Council\nof Turkey through the research project TBAG 109T748.
