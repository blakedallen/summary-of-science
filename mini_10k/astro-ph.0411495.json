Stars:formation \u2013 ISM:clouds-minimum mass-fragmentation-turbulence\n\n1. Introduction\n3-dimensional opacity-limited hierarchical fragmentation\nyields a minimum stellar mass MMIN3 \u223c 0.007 to 0.010 M\u2299.\nThis result was first obtained to order of magnitude by Rees\n(1976), but the range quoted above is the result of more\ndetailed treatments of the thermodynamics of fragmentation by Low & Lynden-Bell (1976), Silk (1977) and Boss\n(1988). However, there are problems with the process of\n3-dimensional hierarchical fragmentation, and this estimate of\nMMIN3 almost certainly needs to be revised upwards (see \u00a72).\nMoreover, it is now generally accepted (e.g. Elmegreen 2000,\nPringle et al. 2001, Hartmann et al. 2001, Elmegreen 2002,\nPadoan & Nordlund 2002, V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al. 2003)\nthat star-forming clouds are transient turbulent entities, and\nthat star formation occurs almost as soon as a cloud forms,\nwithin a few crossing times. In this picture, prestellar cores\nare created where turbulent elements collide with sufficient\nram-pressure for the resulting shock-compressed layer to be\ngravitationally unstable. The process of fragmentation is then\nquite different from that envisaged in 3-dimensional hierarchical fragmentation. In particular, (i) the fragmentation of a\nshock-compressed layer can, and usually does, proceed whilst\nthe layer is still accumulating (and therefore it is confined\nby ram pressure); (ii) the convergent motions leading to the\nformation of a fragment are initially concentrated in the plane\n\nSend offprint requests to: D.F.A.Boyd,\ne-mail: D.Boyd@astro.cf.ac.uk\ne-mail: A.Whitworth@astro.cf.ac.uk\n\nof the shocked layer, i.e. fragmentation of a shock-compressed\nlayer is essentially two-dimensional.\nIn this paper, we present a model to describe the\n2-dimensional opacity-limited fragmentation of a shockcompressed layer and use this model to determine the minimum mass of the fragments that can condense out of such\na layer, MMIN2 . Section 2 reviews the standard paradigm of 3dimensional hierarchical fragmentation, in which a cloud fragments into smaller and smaller subclouds until radiative cooling can no longer match the compressional heating rate and the\nthe subclouds become approximately adiabatic. In Section 3 we\nhighlight the differences between hierarchical 3-dimensional\nfragmentation and the fragmentation of a 2-dimensional layer.\nWe derive equations to describe how a shock-compressed layer\nis formed by the collision of two streams of gas, and how the\nlayer fragments whilst it is still forming. In Section 4 we use\nthis model to follow the evolution of a fragment and hence to\nestimate the minimum mass for a fragment. In Section 5 we\nbriefly summarize our results.\nObservational and numerical evidence for the formation\nand fragmentation of shock-compressed layers, in regions\nof imminent or ongoing star formation, is hard to identify.\nThis contrasts with the substantial evidence for the formation\nand fragmentation of filaments in such regions. Nonetheless,\nwe believe that the formation and fragmentation of shockcompressed layers must be the fundamental process in turbulent star formation regions. First (from a theoretical perspective), to create a filament ab initio would require a very contrived flow geometry. Second (again from a theoretical perspective), the fragmentation of a layer normally proceeds via\n\n\f2\n\nD.F.A.Boyd and A.P.Whitworth: The Minimum Mass for Opacity-Limited Fragmentation in Turbulent Cloud Cores\n\nthe formation of a network of filaments (e.g. Turner et al. 1995,\nWhitworth et al. 1995, Bhattal et al. 1998); this is because of\nthe well established theorem (e.g. Zeldovich 1979) which asserts that if gravitational contraction gets ahead in one dimension (due either to a greater initial perturbation, or less resistance), it tends to get further ahead. Third (from an observational perspective), layers are much harder to identify than filaments, unless they are seen edge-on, in which case they look\nlike filaments.\nMoreover, free-floating objects with masses as low as\n0.003 M\u2299 have now been detected in young star clusters, like\n\u03c3 Orionis (Zapatero Osorio et al. 2002), and it beholds us to\nask how they might have formed. They cannot form by threedimensional fragmentation, but it appears that they could form\nby layer fragmentation, as analyzed here. Other possible formation mechanisms include the photo-erosion of pre-existing\nmassive cores (Hester 1997, Whitworth & Zinnecker 2004) and\nimpulsive interactions between discs in dense clusters (Boffin\net al. 1998, Watkins et al. 1998a,b).\n\n2. Three-dimensional hierarchical fragmentation\nTheories of star formation have traditionally been based on\nthe idea of opacity-limited hierarchical fragmentation (Hoyle\n1953). A massive, 3-dimensional, Jeans-unstable cloud starts\nto contract and, as long as the isothermal sound speed, a, remains constant, the Jeans mass\n#1/2\n\"\n6 a3\n375 a6\n,\n(1)\n\u223c\nMJEANS3 \u2243\n4 \u03c0 G3 \u03c1\nG3/2 \u03c11/2\ndecreases with increasing density, \u03c1. Thus, once the original\ncloud has contracted sufficiently, the Jeans mass MJEANS3 is reduced and the cloud can fragment into subclouds. Once these\nsubclouds have contracted sufficiently, they themselves can\nfragment into still smaller 'sub-subclouds', and so on. The process can continue recursively, breaking the original cloud up\ninto ever smaller fragments, as long as the isothermal sound\nspeed remains approximately constant, i.e. as long as the contracting gas is able to radiate away, immediately, the PdV work\nbeing done on it by compression. Once the smallest fragments\nbecome so dense and opaque to their own cooling radiation that\nthey can no longer radiate away the PdV work immediately, the\nsound speed starts to increase, the Jeans mass decreases no further, and fragmentation therefore stops.\nThe minimum mass for star formation can be found from a\ngeneral analysis of this process, as shown by Rees (1976); for\nsimplicity we neglect all purely numerical factors. A fragment\nof radius R, which has just become Jeans unstable and started\nto condense out, contracts at speed dR/dt \u223c \u2212 a. Hence the\nheating rate due to PdV work is\nH = \u2212P\n\ndR\ndV\n\u223c \u2212 \u03c1 a 2 R2\n\u223c \u03c1 a 3 R2 ,\ndt\ndt\n\n(2)\n\nwhere we have substituted P = \u03c1a2 and dV/dt \u223c R2 dR/dt. If\nthe fragment is to remain approximately isothermal, this must\nbe less than the maximum possible radiative cooling rate,\nC \u223c R2 \u03c3SB T 4 ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c3SB is the Stefan Boltzman constant and T is the temperature. This maximum cooling rate will only be realized if the\nfragment cools like a blackbody, i.e. if it is optically thick but\nonly just; detailed calculations (e.g. Low & Lynden-Bell, 1976)\nindicate that this is usually the case. To ensure that C > H, i.e.\nthat cooling is sufficently rapid to keep a constant, we require\n\u03c1 <\n\u223c \u03c1MAX \u223c\n\n\u03c3SB T 4\n,\na3\n\n(4)\n\nand hence\nM >\n\u223c MMIN3 \u223c\n\na3\nG3/2 \u03c11/2\nMAX\n\n\u223c c\n\n#1\n\" #3/2 \"\nkB T 4\nh\n,\nG\nm\u03049\n\n(5)\n\nor equivalently\nM >\n\u223c MMIN3 \u223c\n\nm3PLANCK \u0014 a \u00151/2\n.\nc\nm\u03042\n\n(6)\n\nHere we have substituted a = (kB T/m\u0304)1/2 , where kB is\nBoltzmann's constant and m\u0304 is the mean gas-particle mass;\n\u03c3SB \u223c kB4 /c2 h3 , where c is the speed of light and h is Planck's\nconstant; and mPLANCK = [ch/G]1/2 is the Planck mass 1 .\nHowever, there are problems with the notion of hierarchical\nfragmentation. Observationally, there is no clear evidence for it\noccuring, and from a theoretical viewpoint, it does not seem to\nwork because the time-scale on which a subcloud condenses\nout is always longer than the time-scale on which its parent\ncloud is contracting.\nSpecifically, the condensation timescale in 3-D is given by\n\uf8f1\n# \uf8fc\u22121/2\n\"\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nMJEANS3 2/3 \uf8f4\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f2\n,\n(7)\n1\u2212\ntCOND3 \u2243 tFF3 \uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\n\uf8f3\nM\n\nwhere tFF3 = (3\u03c0/32G\u03c1)1/2 is the freefall time in 3D. Thus a\nparent cloud is always closer to freefall collapse than its subclouds. If we assume that the whole of the parent cloud breaks\nup into subclouds, so that at their inception the subclouds are\ntouching, then a subcloud has insufficient time to establish itself as a distinct entity before it gets merged with neighbouring\nsubclouds by the overall contraction of the parent cloud. For\nexample, a subcloud with M \u2243 4MJEANS3 condenses out on a\ntimescale \u223c 1.3 tFF3 (and smaller subclouds condense out even\nmore slowly), whereas the parent cloud contracts on a timescale \u223c tFF3 .\nIf, instead, we assume that at their inception the subclouds\nare not touching, we must consider whether a subcloud continues to grow by accreting material from its surroundings as\nit condenses out. If we take at face value the Bondi formula\nfor the rate of spherically symmetric accretion onto a mass M,\nfrom a background medium having density \u03c1 and isothermal\nsound speed a,\ndM\ne3/2 \u03c0 G2 \u03c1 M 2\n=\ndt\na3\n1\n\n(8)\n\nEquation (6) shows that MMIN3 is much smaller than the\nChandrasekhar mass by virtue of (i) the mean gas-particle mass m\u0304\nbeing much larger than the mean mass per electron (2mPROTON /(1 + X),\nwhere X is the fractional abundance of hydrogen by mass); and (ii) the\nsound speed, a, being much less than the speed of light, c.\n\n\fD.F.A.Boyd and A.P.Whitworth: The Minimum Mass for Opacity-Limited Fragmentation in Turbulent Cloud Cores\n\n(Bondi 1952), we can rewrite this equation in the form\n#\n\"\nM\ndln(M)\n.\n\u2243 42\nd[t/tFF3 ]\nMJEANS3\n\n(9)\n\nThus, even though the Bondi scenario is not strictly applicable,\nthe implication is that the subcloud mass will increase by a very\nlarge factor whilst it is condensing out (e.g. a fragment with\ninitial mass 4MJEANS3 notionally increases its mass by a factor of\n42 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 1.3 \u2243 220). We must conclude that the initial fragment\nmass will be a significant underestimate of the final fragment\nmass.\n\n3. Fragmentation of a two-dimensional layer\nThere is an alternative paradigm to hierarchical fragmentation,\nwhich overcomes these problems and agrees better with observation. In this paradigm (e.g. Larson 1981, Elmegreen 2000,\nPringle, Allen & Lubow 2001, Hartmann, Ballesteros-Paredes,\n& Bergin 2001, Padoan & Nordlund 2002, Elmegreen 2002,\nV\u00e1zquez-Semadeni, Ballesteros-Paredes & Klessen 2003, Mac\nLow & Klessen 2004), giant molecular clouds are relatively\nshort-lived objects which form and dissolve on a dynamical\ntimescale and have a turbulent and inhomogeneous internal\nstructure. The substructure within a molecular cloud is therefore highly transient, with clumps forming, dispersing, and reforming on a dynamical timescale, without necessarily spawning new stars. Only occasionally will a particularly dense, massive and strongly converging shock lead to the formation of a\nprestellar core. In this scenario, both core formation and core\ncollapse are triggered by the collision of two turbulent elements of gas and the formation of a gravitationally unstable,\nshock-compressed layer. This is a one-step, two-dimensional\nfragmentation process: 'one step' because the process does not\nrepeat itself hierarchically; 'two-dimensional' because, when\nthe layer fragments, the wavelengths of the most rapidly growing fragments are much larger than the thickness of the layer\n(Whitworth et al. 1994a,b).\n\n3.1. Linear fragmentation of a static layer in\nplane-parallel symmetry\n2-dimensional fragmentation of a static layer (e.g. Larson\n1985) is fundamentally different from 3-dimensional fragmentation. The Jeans mass is given by\nMJEANS2 \u2243\n\n0.2 a4\n9 a4\n\u223c\n,\n2\n16 \u03c0 G \u03a3\nG2 \u03a3\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03a3 is the surface density of the layer; and the timescale\non which Jeans unstable fragments condense out of the layer is\ngiven by\n\uf8f1\"\n#1/2 \"\n#\uf8fc\u22121/2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nMJEANS2 \uf8f4\na \uf8f4\n\uf8f2 MJEANS2\n\uf8fd\ntCOND2 \u2243\n\u2212\n.\n(11)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\n\u03c0G\u03a3 \uf8f3 M\nM \uf8f4\n\nSince tCOND2 has a minimum for M \u2243 4MJEANS2 , fragments on\nthis mass scale condense out faster than smaller fragments\nand faster than larger fragments. Therefore 4MJEANS2 is a preferred mass scale for fragmentation. Fragmentation on this\n\n3\n\nscale is likely to be permanent, because the fragments will\nnot be merged by the overall contraction of the parent layer\non larger scales. Given these differences between hierarchical\nfragmentation of a 3-dimensional cloud and one-step fragmentation of a 2-dimensional layer, we are interested in exploring\nhow, and at what mass scale, opacity limits the fragmentation\nof a 2-dimensional layer. Is the minimum mass formed at the\nopacity limit significantly different from that estimated for 3dimensional fragmentation?\n\n3.2. A shock-compressed layer in plane-parallel\nsymmetry\nWe consider two identical streams of gas with uniform density\n\u03c1 and uniform isothermal sound speed a, which collide headon at relative speed 2v to form a layer. We assume that a plane\ncontact-discontinuity forms where the two streams meet and\nwe fix our main coordinate frame in this contact discontinuity.\nThe two streams approach the contact discontinuity with velocities \u00b1v, and a plane-parallel layer forms symmetrically about\nthe discontinuity, bounded by two accretion shocks, as illustrated in Figure 3.2. For simplicity we assume that radiative\ncooling in the shocked gas is so efficient that the gas rapidly\ncools back to its pre-shock temperature. If the full thickness of\nthe layer is 2Z(t), then the gas flows into the accretion shock at\nspeed uIN = v + \u017b, where \u017b = dZ/dt, and out at speed uOUT = \u017b;\nnote that uIN and uOUT are measured relative to the shock-front.\nApplying the isothermal shock condition,\nuIN\na\n,\n(12)\n=\na\nuOUT\nwe obtain\na\nv + \u017b\n,\n=\na\n\u017b\nwhence\n\n(13)\n\n[v2 + 4a2 ]1/2 \u2212 v\n.\n(14)\n2\nThe post-shock density (i.e. the density in the shock compressed layer) is\n\n\u017b =\n\n\u03c1SHOCKED = \u03c1\n\nuIN\n[v2 + 4a2 ]1/2 + v\n=\u03c1 2\n,\nuOUT\n[v + 4a2 ]1/2 \u2212 v\n\n(15)\n\nand so the surface density \u03a3 of the layer grows linearly with\ntime according to\nn\no\n(16)\n\u03a3(t) = 2 \u03c1SHOCKED \u017b t = \u03c1 [v2 + 4a2 ]1/2 + v t .\nAs long as v \u226b a, we can approximate\n\n\u017b \u2243\n\na2\n\u226a a,\nv\n\n\u03c1SHOCKED \u2243\n\n\u03c1 v2\n,\na2\n\n\u03a3(t) \u2243 2 \u03c1 v t ,\n\n(17)\n(18)\n(19)\n\nand so the sound-crossing time of the layer, Z/a, is much\nsmaller than its growth time, Z/\u017b. This means that the layer has\n\n\f4\n\nD.F.A.Boyd and A.P.Whitworth: The Minimum Mass for Opacity-Limited Fragmentation in Turbulent Cloud Cores\n\nsufficient time to relax and remain close to hydrostatic equilibrium. We also note that, provided\nt <\n\n1\n,\n2 (G \u03c1)1/2\n\n(20)\n\nG\u03a32 \u226a \u03c1SHOCKED a2 , and thus self-gravity plays a negligible role\ncompared with ram pressure in confining the layer in the direction perpendicular to the contact discontinuity. Consequently,\nthe plane-parallel hydrostatic equilibrium of the layer has a\nvery flat density profile, with little density contrast between the\ncentre and the edge.\n\n3.3. Linear fragmentation of the layer\nNow we consider a small circular patch of radius r on the layer,\nand consider whether it is able to condense out. The radial motion of the patch is determined by a competition between the\nhydrostatic acceleration \u223c a2 /r (which promotes expansion),\nand the self-gravitational acceleration \u223c \u03c0G\u03a3 (which promotes\ncontraction).

Non-Linear fragmentation of the layer\nThe linear analysis above does not take into account the material which continues to flow into the shock layer, after it has\nstarted to fragment. It also does not describe how the fragment\ndevelops as it condenses out.\nIn order to follow the condensation of fragments into\nthe non-linear regime, we model them as uniform density\nspheroids with radius r and half-height z.

Similar expressions describe the excursions of a prolate\nspheroid.\nFor an oblate spheroidal fragment condensing out of a\nshock-compressed layer, while the layer continues to accrete\nmatter from the converging flows which are forming it, we must\nmodify these equations to take into account two facts. (i) The\nexternal pressure is the ram pressure of the inflowing gas. (ii)\nThe spheroid grows in mass as a consequence of the inflowing\ngas. Knowing \u017c, which is the speed with which the gas already\nin the spheroid expands, we can calculate how fast, \u1e8f, the shock\nfront has to advance towards the inflowing gas, in order to decelerate the new inflowing gas.

The\nopacity limit for the proto-fragment is reached as soon as H +\nD>\n\u223c C(T ). In reality, the radiative cooling is more complicated\nthan equation (40).

In either case, half the IPCS\nradiation is radiated away from the fragment, and half towards\nit. In the most extreme case, all of this latter half is absorbed by\nthe fragment, and then has to be re-radiated at temperature T ,\nalong with the internal energy delivered by PdV compression.\nThus, by requiring the fragment to radiate at temperature T all\nthe energy dissipated in the accretion shock, we are making a\nrather conservative assumption.\nTo ensure that a proto-fragment forms a distinct condensation, i.e. that it continues to undergo contraction after the opacity limit has been reached, we set the following two survival\nconditions at the opacity limit:\n1. the proto-fragment must be contracting in both the radial\nand vertical dimensions, i.e.\n\u1e59LIMIT < 0 ,\n\u017cLIMIT < 0 ;\n\n(42)\n(43)\n\n2. the final extent of the proto-fragment, in both dimensions,\nmust be less than or equal to half its initial radial size, i.e.\nrLIMIT < 0.5 rINIT ,\nzLIMIT < 0.5 rINIT .\n\n(44)\n(45)\n\n\f6\n\nD.F.A.Boyd and A.P.Whitworth: The Minimum Mass for Opacity-Limited Fragmentation in Turbulent Cloud Cores\n\nFig. 2. A log/log plot of the (\u03c1, v) plane. The dots mark combinations of pre-shock density, \u03c1, and collision speed, v, for which\n(assuming a post-shock effective sound speed a = 0.2 km s\u22121 , corresponding to molecular gas at 10 K) the fastest-growing\nfragment mass is less than 0.005M\u2299. The irregularities in the boundary of this region have to do with the tendency of fragments\nwith mass near the fastest growing one to undergo pulsations \u2013 see \u00a74.2 and \u00a74.3. The solid line is the locus (equation (41))\nbelow which \u03c1 must fall if the immediate post-shock cooling radiation is to be negligible (as we assume).\nFor given \u03c1, v and a (i.e. for a given colliding flow), we must\npick tINIT and rINIT , where tINIT is the time at which the fragment\nunder consideration starts to condense out, and rINIT is its initial\nradius. Thus the initial conditions for a trial fragment are\nt = tINIT ,\n\n(46)\n\nr(tINIT ) = rINIT ,\n\u1e59(tINIT ) = 0 ,\n\n(47)\n(48)\n\nz(tINIT ) = Z(tINIT ) ,\n\u017c(tINIT ) = \u017b(tINIT ) .\n\n(49)\n(50)\n\nWe can then use equations (37), (31), (34), (35) and (36) to\nfollow the development of the fragment. Then we can use\nequations (38), (39) and (40) to evaluate H, D, C, and check\nwhether the fragment has reached the opacity limit (H + D >\n\u223c\nC). Finally, once the limit is reached, we can check the survival\nconditions, equations (42), (43), (44) and (45).\nIn order to reduce the parameter space we fix a =\n0.2 km s\u22121 , correponding to molecular gas at 10 K. The equations are integrated using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme.\nIn reality the gas in the two colliding streams will not have\nuniform density, and so \u03c1 should be interpreted as the mean\npre-shock density. The presence of inhomogeneities in the preshock gas will promote fragmentation of the resulting layer, by\n\ncreating the seed perturbations from which condensations subsequently grow. It will also tend to yield condensations with\nfinite angular momentum. However, the lowest-mass condensations will be those with low angular momentum, and so we\nignore angular momentum in this exploratory analysis.\n\n4. Results and discussion\n\n4.1. General considerations\nA condensing fragment posseses two orthogonal dimensions r\nand z. Moreover, (a) r and z in general have different initial\nvalues (r(tINIT ) and z(tINIT )). (b) Their excursions are driven by\ndifferent external pressures (see equations (34) and (35)). (c)\nThe coupling between them (which occurs through both internal pressure and self-gravity) is non-linear. Therefore a fragment can evolve in quite complicated ways. In particular, small\nfragments which are not initially very unstable tend to oscillate\nuntil they accrete sufficient mass from the continuing inflow to\nbecome unstable against monotonic condensation. The oscillations in r and z normally have unrelated periods, and so the\nmodel has to be able to treat both oblate and prolate spheroids.\nHowever, once a fragment starts to condense out it is normally\noblate, due to the extra ram pressure exerted in the z dimension\nby the inflow.\n\n\fD.F.A.Boyd and A.P.Whitworth: The Minimum Mass for Opacity-Limited Fragmentation in Turbulent Cloud Cores\n\n7\n\nFig. 3.

Oscillations\nIf we fix \u03c1 and v, and vary tINIT and rINIT , we find that the lowestmass condensation, mMIN (\u03c1, v), forms when tINIT \u2243 tFRAG and\nrINIT \u2243 0.5 rFRAG . Fragments with rINIT <\n\u223c 0.5 rFRAG tend to undergo radial oscillations before accumulating sufficient mass to\ncondense out. Fragments with rINIT > 0.5 rFRAG tend to condense\nout monotonically. The lowest-mass fragments are those which\nstart with just enough mass to condense out monotonically, i.e.\nrINIT \u2243 0.5rFRAG . Since 0.5 rFRAG \u2243 RJEANS2 , this finding agrees\nwith the predictions of the linear stability analysis in \u00a73.3.\n\n4.3. The optimum combination of \u03c1 and v for\nproducing low-mass condensations\nSuppose now that only \u03c1 is fixed, and v is varied. For each v\nwe can determine the lowest-mass condensation mMIN (\u03c1, v), by\nvarying tINIT and rINIT as described above. What we find is that\nas v is increased at fixed \u03c1, mMIN (\u03c1, v) at first decreases, reaches\na minimum, and then increases. Thus for any value of \u03c1 there\nis an optimum value of v for spawning low-mass condensations. Fig. 2 shows the (\u03c1, v) plane and marks discrete points\nfor which mMIN (\u03c1, v) is less than 0.005M\u2299 \u2261 5MJUPITER . We see\nthat there is a significant region of (\u03c1, v) space in which condensations with mass below 0.005M\u2299 can form.\nThis region has an irregular boundary because protofragments can undergo out-of-phase pulsations in the r- and\nz-dimensions. If a proto-fragment undergoes a pulsation in the\nr-dimension and expands for a while (\u1e59 > 0), it experiences a\nprolonged period of growth due to accretion onto its relatively\nlarge cross-section (\u03c0r2 ), and hence its mass increases rapidly.\nSince the onset, amplitude and phase of such pulsations is critically dependent on initial conditions, small changes in \u03c1 and/or\nv can result in quite large changes in mMIN .\nThe full line on Fig. 2 shows the locus \u03c1 = \u03c1CRIT =\n10\u221212 g cm\u22123 [v/km s\u22121 ]5 . Hence the condition for the IPSC radiation to be neglected (equation (41)) requires \u03c1 to be well\nbelow this line. Evidently this condition is always easily fulfilled.\n\nquickly resumes its radial contraction. Soon after this the opacity limit is reached, and we must presume that the fragment\nthen switches to Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction. At this stage\nthe fragment is roughly spherical. It is still accreting, at a rate\n\u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 MJUPITER yr\u22121 , and it has a dynamical timescale of\n\u223c 1000 yr, so we might expect its mass to increase by a further\nfew tenths of a Jupiter mass during the subsequent condensation.\n\n5. Conclusions\nIn 3-dimensional hierarchical fragmentation, the minimum\nmass is estimated to be MMIN3 \u223c 7 to 10 MJUPITER (e.g. 7 MJUPITER ,\nLow & Lynden-Bell 1976, 10 MJUPITER , Silk 1977; 10 MJUPITER ,\nBoss 1988). Moreover, these estimates probably need to be revised upwards, to take account of ongoing accretion and merging during concensation (see \u00a72).\nHowever, surveys of young clusters are beginning to find\nobjects with masses estimated to be as low as 3 MJUPITER (e.g.\nZapatero Osorio et al. 2002).\nWe find that, in the 2-dimensional fragmentation of a shock\ncompressed layer, the minimum mass is significantly smaller\nthan 10 MJUPITER . For certain rather specific shock parameters,\nfragments with mass < 3 MJUPITER can condense out \u2013 specifically MMIN2 \u2243 2.6 MJUPITER \u2013 and for a wide range of shock parameters fragments with <\n\u223c 5MJUPITER can condense out. Since (i)\nlayer fragmentation is probably a more realistic model for fragmentation in highly turbulent, transient star-forming clouds,\n(ii) layer fragmentation is more likely to be permanent than\n3-dimensional fragmentation (because the fragments in a layer\ncondense out faster than the layer as a whole), and (iii) our analysis takes proper account of ongoing accretion during fragmentation, we conclude that free-floating planetary-mass objects\ncan form by the fragmentation of a shock-compressed layer,\nin the same way as stars and brown dwarves.\nAcknowledgements.

By the time the fragment has reached\nthe opacity limit, its radius is \u223c 12 AU, and it is roughly spherical, but slightly oblate. 1600 yr have passed since its inception,\nand its mass has increased by 1.1MJUPITER to 2.6MJUPITER . Thus\nMMIN2 \u2243 2.6 MJUPITER .\nFig. 3 shows the development of this fragment. For the first\n\u223c 1200 yr, the fragment contracts in the radial dimension, but\nexpands in the vertical dimension, due to accretion of extra\nmaterial from the inflow into the layer. Around 1200 years after its inception the fragment starts to contract in the vertical\ndimension. At the same time there is a very small bounce in\nthe radial dimension, but this is short-lived, and the fragment\n\nBhattal, A. S., Francis, N., Watkins, S. J., Whitworth, A.
