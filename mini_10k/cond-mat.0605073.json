Many classical quantities such as resistance\nmust be reinterpreted for systems on a mesoscopic scale.\nOne such classical concept is that of the refrigerator: a\ndevice that uses an external source of work to cool a gas.\nIn this paper we consider whether this classical concept\ncan be applied to an electron gas so that one could cool\nsuch a gas by applying a voltage to a device.\nThere are many ways to cool electrons in a condensedmatter system. For example, thermoelectric coolers\nbased on the Peltier effect1 are available commercially.\nA different kind of electron-cooling mechanism in semiconductor devices is based on a quasistatic expansion of\na two-dimensional electron gas.2 Still other possibilities\ninclude taking advantage of many-body effects that can\nlead to liquid/gas phase transitions in the electron population in a semiconductor quantum well.3,4\nIn this paper we investigate electron cooling in a mesoscopic solid-state device using evaporative emission. This\nmethod entails removal of (\"filtering\") electrons from a\nhigh-energy subband of a many-electron system, followed\nby relaxation of the remaining electrons to a temperature\nlower than that of the initial system. Evaporative cooling is widely used in bosonic systems.5 But this method\nis harder to implement for fermionic systems, as we shall\ndiscuss below.\nIn section II we describe the theory of a twodimensional device to cool electrons in quantum wires.\nWe use the Landauer formula6,7,8 to analyze the cooling\nproperties of these devices. This formula was originally\ndeveloped to explain the transport properties of electrons\nin a quantum device. It relates these properties to the\nquantum mechanical scattering amplitudes for electrons\nthat pass through the device. To calculate these amplitudes, we use an extension of R-matrix theory9,10,11 that\nwe summarize in the Appendix. In section III we use\nthis theory to calculate cooling properties of several twodimensional devices. We begin with a simple T-junction\n\ndevice and show that by optimizing its design we can\nachieve electron cooling. We improve upon this result\nby switching to a \"plus-junction\" design, which can give\nup to 15% cooling. In section IV we discuss applications\nand realistic parameters for a device to cool electrons,\nand in V we summarize our key results and describe future research.\n\nII. ELECTRON COOLING IN\nTWO-DIMENSIONAL QUANTUM DEVICES\n\nOur theoretical approach is analogous to the working principle of the classical Hilsch vortex tube,13 which\nuses a T-shaped assembly of pipes to separate highpressure air into a high-temperature system and a lowtemperature system. This separation does not violate the\nSecond Law of Thermodynamics, because the system is\ndriven by an external force.\nWe use a similar idea to cool electrons in a quantum mechanical system. The simplest such device uses a\nT-shaped assembly of quantum wires to remove higherenergy electrons from an electron gas at fixed temperature. Figure 1 is a schematic of such a configuration that\ndefines the regions of the device. We assume that our\ndevice is formed from a quantum well whose thickness is\nsufficiently small that the device can be considered twodimensional. That is, we assume that the device confines\nelectrons to a layer of thickness z0 such that the confinement energy associated with motion in the z-direction is\nmuch larger than any other energy in the problem. (This\nconfinement energy is ~2 \u03c0 2 /2m\u2217 z02 , where m\u2217 is the electron effective mass.)\nThere are three leads in the T-junction: the input lead,\noutput lead, and sidearm, as shown in Fig.1. We shall\nlabel physical quantities by subscripts \"i,\" \"o,\" and \"s\"\nrespectively; for example, we denote the widths of the\nleads by wi , wo , and ws . Electrons are injected into this\ndevice through the input lead, and in the input region are\nin thermal equilibrium at an initial temperature Ti and\nchemical potential \u03bci . Filtering of higher-energy elec-\n\n\f2\n\nle\u2212e\nInput\nRegion\n\nScattering\nRegion\n\nBallistic\nRegion\n\nA.\nAdiabatic\nRegion\n\nEquilibrium\n\nInput electron densities and populations\n\nProvided the electrons in each lead are in thermodynamic equilibrium, we can treat them as an ideal Fermi\ngas. For lead l, therefore, the subband electron density\n(per unit volume) in an open (energetically accessible)\nsubband n is\n\nle\u2212ph\n\n(l)\n\u03c1(l)\nn (E, Tl , \u03bcl ) = f (E; Tl , \u03bcl ) Dn (E)\n\n(1)\n\nSidearm\n(l)\n\nfor n such that the subband energy obeys \u01ebn \u2264 E. In\nthis equation, the density of states is\nFIG. 1: Regions in a two-dimensional T-junction device. The\n\"ballistic region\" is the part of the device within a distance\ncomparable to the electron-electron scattering length (le\u2212e )\nof the junction. The \"adiabatic region\" is within the electronphonon scattering length (le\u2212ph ) of the junction. It is in the\nadiabatic region that we achieve cooling. At larger distances,\nin the \"equilibrium region,\" the electrons have returned to\nthe temperature of the lattice.\n\ntrons from the initial electron gas occurs in the scattering\nregion. The rate of scattering into the sidearm depends\nupon the electron energy: if the subband energy in lead of\nwidth w is given by En = ~2 \u03c0 2 n2 /2mw2 , then the \"force\"\nelectrons exert on the sides of the lead, F = \u2212dE/dw,\nis larger for larger n. Thus when an electron encounters\nthe sidearm, the higher-subband states are more likely to\nsquirt down the sidearm. Alternatively, one can see that\nthe higher-subband electrons scatter preferentially to the\nsidearm because they are in states with wave functions\nthat are linear combinations of plane waves with larger\ntransverse momenta.\nElectrons that scatter forward into the output lead proceed into the ballistic region, where the electron population is determined entirely by the product of the initial\nelectron distribution and the scattering probability. Next\nthe electrons enter the adiabatic region, where they exchange energy among themselves and so relax to a temperature To and a chemical potential \u03bco . In principle, the\nvalues of these properties can be calculated from conservation laws for energy and particle number. In section\nIII we report such calculations and show that for some\ndevice geometries the temperature To is less than the initial temperature: this temperature decrease is the desired\ncooling effect.\nFinally, at large distances (as determined by the\nelectron-phonon scattering rate) the electrons will return\nto equilibrium with the lattice at the initial temperature Ti ; this re-equilibration occurs in the equilibrium\nregion. To see cooling, one must measure the electron\ntemperature before they get to this region\nBelow we define our notation and describe how we calculate the electron distributions in the input and output\nleads. We also define and describe the calculation of a\nquantitative measure of electron cooling in the device.\n\n\u0003\u22121/2\n\u0002\n.\nDn(l) (E) = E \u2212 \u01eb(l)\nn\n\n(2)\n\nThe quantity E is the dimensionless electron energy measured in units of the lowest subband energy of the input\nchannel, E1i \u2261 ~2 \u03c0 2 /2m\u2217 wi2 . We choose the zero of energy at the energy of the ground transverse state in the\ninput lead.

By the time these electrons have\ntraveled a distance along the lead comparable to several\ntimes their relaxation length, they have come to equilibrium at To and \u03bco , and it is meaningful to describe\n\n\f3\nthem by a Fermi-Dirac distribution function f (E; To , \u03bco ).\nThese output-lead properties refer to the electron population in the adiabatic region, where the electrons are in\nthermodynamic equilibrium. Given Ti and \u03bci for the input lead, our goal is to determine the values of To and \u03bco\nfor the output lead that yields the lowest To < Ti ; i.e.,\nwhich maximizes cooling of transmitted electrons.\nFor a given Ti and \u03bci , we can determine the temperature in the output lead To by requiring that the number\nof electrons in the output lead at equilibrium equals the\nnumber of electrons transmitted into this lead (conservation of electrons in the output lead). To set up equations\nto implement this strategy, we must define subband and\nlead populations in terms of electrons transmitted from\nthe input lead into the output lead.

In\na real device not all higher-subband electrons will scatter\ninto the sidearm, and not all the lower-subband electrons\nwill scatter into the output lead. The probabilities for\nelectron scattering, as quantified in transmission coefficients, depend on system properties such as the geometry, and on scattering potentials. We consider \"perfect\ndevices\" that have no impurities, so electrons are scattered only by the boundaries of the device. We further\nassume that the potential energy of the electrons in the\nleads is zero; this simplifying assumption is not essential\nto either the cooling effect or to our formalism. We can\nalter the scattering of electrons by changing the ratio of\nthe width of the sidearm to that of the input lead (Fig. 1)\nor by changing the geometry altogether.\n\n\f4\nA.\n\nT-junction cooling devices\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\nTransmission coefficient\n\nTo calculate the cooling parameter \u03b7 we need to know\nthe population of electrons in each subband. To determine this quantity we must know transmission coefficients from a state in the input lead to states in the output lead. To calculate these transmission coefficients we\nuse a generalization of R-matrix theory that we summarize in the Appendix. To determine the results reported\nhere, we calculated cooling parameters \u03b7 using transmission coefficients in a T-junction device for various ratios\nof the width ws of the sidearm to the width wi of the input lead, keeping the width wo of the output lead equal\nto wi .\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\n1.\n\n0\n\nA T-junction device with ws = wi = 1.0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nIncident electron energy\n\n2.\n\nAlternative T-junction geometries\n\nTo determine whether a T-junction device can cool\nelectrons, we now consider several widths ws of the\n\n2.2\n\n2.0\n\nCooling parameter\n\nWe first consider a T-junction device in which all leads\nhave the same width: wi = ws = wo . Figure 2(a)\nshows \"state-to-lead\" transmission coefficients for scattering into the output lead of electrons in different subbands of the input lead. These coefficients are sums\nover all energetically accessible (\"open\") subbands no\nof the output\nlead of state-to-state transmission coeffi\u2032\ncients Tnlo,i,ni [see Eq. 7] from a given state ni of the input lead. This figure illustrates the loss of some highersubband electrons from the initial electron distribution.\nThe cooling parameter \u03b7 for this case is shown in\nFig. 2(b) for different values of initial temperature Ti\nwith the initial chemical potential \u03bci = 0. (Note that we\nmeasure the energy in terms of E1i , and all the energies\nare measured from E1i . So \u03bci = 0 means that the external\npotential of the system is such that the Fermi energy is\nEF = ~2 \u03c0 2 /2m\u2217 wi2 .) For this geometry \u03b7 > 1 for all\ninitial temperatures the cooling parameter. That is, this\ndevice heats electrons-the opposite of the desired effect.\nThis case is important because it demonstrates that\neven if high-energy electrons are lost due to scattering, a\ncompensatory loss of low-energy electrons may produce\nan overall heating effect. Loss of low-energy electrons\nopens gaps in the electron distribution at low energies.\nHigher-energy electrons can then relax into these newly\naccessible low-energy states, with the resulting energy\ndifference liberated as thermal energy. If this happens,\nthen the loss of low-energy electrons will heat the system.\nEven a small dip in the scattered-electron distribution at\nlow energies will significantly affect the final temperature. To cool electrons, therefore, it is not sufficient to\nmerely scatter higher-energy electrons. We must scatter\nthermally excited electrons but not significantly scatter\nelectrons in lower-energy subbands.\n\n1.8\n\n1.6\n\n1.4\n\n1.2\n\n1.0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nReduced initial temperature\nFIG. 2: Upper panel: State-to-output-lead transmission coefficients for electrons in a T-junction device with wi = ws =\nwo .

See also the data in Tbl. I, which\nanalyzes cooling for this case.\n\nWe shall now consider in detail a device with ws /wi =\n0.4, which gives \u223c 0.05% cooling. Figure 4 shows stateto-lead transmission coefficients for such a device. Different curves correspond to different initial subbands. At\nlow energies the transmission probability is nearly unity,\nso for this geometry no low-energy electrons are lost from\nthe initial distribution. Were we to adjust the Fermi energy of this device so only the lowest two subbands were\noccupied, we would see cooling.\nIn Fig. 5 we illustrate the dependence of the cooling effect on the initial chemical potential \u03bci . This figure shows\nthe cooling parameter \u03b7 for ws /wi = 0.4 as a function\nof the initial temperature Ti for \u03bci = 0.0, 3.0, and 6.0.\nElectron cooling is maximized for \u03bci = 0, the edge of the\nlowest subband. At this chemical potential all electrons\nscattered into the sidearm are in the thermally active region of the Fermi distribution. Cooling is also obtained\nfor \u03bci = 3.0, the edge of the second subband. But at\nlarger values of \u03bci the device heats electrons.\nThis example shows that a T-junction can cool electrons. We would prefer, however, a device that produces more cooling than 0.05%. Investigation of other\n\n\f6\nthis device by, for example, increasing the width of the\nsidearms with increasing distance from the junction. Alternatively, one could round the sharp corners at each\njunction into smooth curves. However, our initial explorations of such alterations (for a T-junction) did not produce substantially more cooling than we obtained with\nthe far simpler plus junction in Fig. 6. The essential\nfeatures that makes the plus junction more effective than\nany T junction is the presence of more than one sidearm.\nIt is also essential the threshold for scattering into these\nsidearms lie above the threshold for the second subband\nof the input lead.\n\nCooling parameter\n\n1.2\n\n1.1\n\n1.0\n\nws\n0.9\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nReduced initial temperature\n\nFIG. 5: The cooling parameter \u03b7 as a function of the reduced\ninitial temperature for a T-junction device with wi = wo and\nws = 0.4wo for three initial chemical potentials, \u03bci = 0.0\n(solid curve), 3.0 (dashed), and 6.0 (dotted). These data are\nbased on the transmission coefficients shown in Fig. 4. Maximum cooling is obtained for \u03bci = 0. The reduced initial\ntemperature is defined in the caption to Fig. 2.\n\nT-junction geometries showed that such a device cannot produce significantly more cooling for any value\nof ws /wi . So we next investigate the addition of a second sidearm. This change produces the \"plus junction\"\nillustrated in Fig. 6.\n\nwi\n\nFIG. 6: Schematic of a plus-junction. Note that while the\nwidths of the input and output leads are equal (wi = wo ),\nthe width ws of the two sidearms may be smaller or larger\nthan wi . This geometry gives substantially more cooling than\nany device we have explored that has only a single sidearm.\n\nIV.\nB.\n\nA \"plus-junction\" cooling device\n\nSince we achieved cooling in a T-junction device with\nws = 0.4, we shall consider a plus junction with the\nsame lead ratios: wi = wo and ws /wo = 0.4. (Note\nthat the widths of the two sidearms in Fig. 6 are the\nsame.) State-to-lead transmission coefficients for this device are shown in Fig. 7(a), and the resulting cooling\nparameter \u03b7 as a function of initial temperature Ti in\nFig. 7(b). The latter figure shows that this geometry\nyields appreciably more electron cooling-greater than\n15%-than did the T-junction devices of Tbl. I. A single\nunit of a plus-junction device with this geometry would\ncool room-temperature electrons by about \u2206T = \u221245C.\nCooling could be further enhanced by combining several\nsuch units in sequence. Comparison of this plus-junction\nto the T-junctions discussion previously, as illustrated\nin Fig. 8, show how greatly adding a sidearm improves\nthe effectiveness with which this simple device cools electrons.\nOne could try to further optimize the geometry of\n\nwo\n\nEXPERIMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\nWe now consider a plus-junction device using realistic\nexperimental parameters for Insb and GaAs. While in\nSec. III we reported results in dimensionless units, we\nhere use dimensional units.\nAll material properties depend on the Fermi energy EF\nof the system. This quantity is inversely proportional to\nthe effective mass m\u2217 of the electrons in the material and\nis determined by the electron density in the reservoir.\nFor our device we chose for the initial chemical potential\n(which is approximately equal to the Fermi energy) \u03bci =\n0. Since we have scaled the energy by E1i and chosen E1i as\nthe zero of energy, setting the initial chemical potential\nequals zero means that\n\u03bci = EF =\n\n~2 \u03c0 2\n,\n2m\u2217 wi2\n\n(16)\n\nwhere wi is the width of the input lead of the device\nin Fig. 6.

We can increase this value\nby decreasing the electron density.\nFor a plus-junction, we were able to maximize cooling by setting the initial temperature to Ti \u223c 2 in dimensionless units. In dimensional units, this optimum\ntemperature is\nkB T = Topt E1i ,\n\n(19a)\n\nUsing Eq. (16), we obtain\nkB T = Topt EF .\n\n(19b)\n\nFor a sample with n = 1.0 \u00d7 1011 cm\u22122 , the initial\ntemperature for maximum cooling is Ti \u223c 82K for GaAs\nand Ti \u223c 399K for InSb. Room temperature (300K)\ncorresponds to T \u223c 1.5 for InSb. One can therefore obtain substantial cooling due to quantum effects in a roomtemperature device. A cooling parameter of \u03b7 \u223c 0.9\nimplies that the electron population is cooled by 30K.\nThe resulting cooled electrons could be used for photodetection of optical frequencies corresponding to thermal\nenergies near room temperature.\nThe devices we have considered have only one cooling\n\n\f8\nstage. One could increase cooling by connecting multiple\nplus junctions in series. The spacing between junctions,\nhowever, must be large enough that resonances in scattering between sidearms are negligible. If not, one would\nhave to treat the device as a single large quantum mechanical scattering target. While the presence of such\nresonances would not preclude cooling, it would make\ncalculations for a chain of junction devices more difficult\nand sensitive to details of phase breaking.\n\nan analytic solution for the amplitudes of outgoing states\nin the leads when only one incoming state is occupied.\n\nS1\nA\n\nSN\n\nLead 1\n\nLead N\nS2\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND PROSPECTS FOR\nFUTURE RESEARCH\n\nMany photo-detection applications require a cold detector. We have presented results for a prototype device\nthat demonstrates electron cooling in a single-particle\npicture. We have shown that, while a naive T-junction\ncan produce modest cooling and may produce heating, adding an additional sidearm yields a device that\ncan produce appreciable cooling -at least 15%. The\nabrupt discontinuities in the confining potentials in these\nmodels are not essential to cooling; what is essential is\nthat higher-subband states, which consist of states with\nlarger transverse momenta, scatter appreciable into the\nsidearms. We therefore expect electron cooling in such\ndevices to be insensitive to details of the potential so\nlong as the potential does not eliminate the states of the\nlowest subband.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis project was supported in part by the US National\nScience Foundation under Grant MRSEC DMR-0080054,\nand EPS-9720651, and PHY\u20130071031.

We can produce a\nHermitian operator by adding to \u0124 the so-called Bloch\noperator L\u0302B .10 We denote the eigenfunctions of the sum\nof these operators in the interior region by |\u03c6i i and write\nthe so-called Bloch eigenvalue equation as\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(A2)\n\u0124 + L\u0302B |\u03c6i i = Ei |\u03c6i i .\nInserting the Bloch operator into the Schroedinger equation we get\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0124 + L\u0302B \u2212 E \u03a8E = L\u0302B \u03a8E .\n(A3)\nWe now expand the scattering wave function |\u03a8E i in\nthe set of orthonormal Bloch eigenfunctions\nX\nCj |\u03c6j i .\n(A4)\n|\u03a8E i =\nj\n\nInserting this expansion into the Schroedinger equation\nand using the properties of the Bloch eigenfunctions\nyields\n|\u03a8E,n0 i =\n\nX h\u03c6j | L\u0302B |\u03a8E,n i\n0\n|\u03c6j i ,\nE\n\u2212\nE\nj\nj\n\n(A5)\n\nwhere Ej is the eigenvalue corresponds to the Bloch\neigenfunction |\u03c6j i. This expansion is valid throughout\nthe interior region A and on its surface (see Fig. 9).\nTo derive an equation for the R matrix, we now apply\n\n\f9\nthis expansion of the scattering state on each boundary\nSi . At each such boundary we can expand the scattering\nfunction in either lead eigenfunctions or Bloch eigenfunctions in the interior region. To be specific, we introduce\na local Cartesian coordinate system for each lead: xq and\nyq are the longitudinal and transverse coordinates of the\nq th lead, respectively. We choose xq = 0 on each boundary. (One can easily choose any orthonormal coordinate\nsystem, mutatis mutandis). Each lead eigenfunction is\nthen a product of a plane wave in the xq direction and a\ntransverse bound-state eigenfunction \u03c7n (yq ).
