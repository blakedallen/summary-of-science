The\ncombined total cross sections, measured as a function of the centre-ofmass energy are shown in Fig. 2. The overall precision of the measured productions rates is at the level of 1% for W-pairs and 5% for\nZ-pairs, and in agreement with the SM predictions. As it can be seen\nin Fig. 2, the W-pair cross section measurement represents alone a\nstunning proof of the presence of both the WWZ and WW\u03b3 couplings\ndictated by the electroweak SU(2)\u2297U(1) gauge structure.\n\nLEP PRELIMINARY\nZZTO and YFSZZ\n\n1\n\n20\n\n0.5\n\n10\nYFSWW/RacoonWW\nno ZWW vertex (Gentle)\nonly \u03bde exchange (Gentle)\n\n0\n\n160\n\n180\n\n200\n\n0\n\n180\n\n190\n\n\u221as (GeV)\n\n200\n\n\u221as (GeV)\n\n\u221a\nFigure 2: Total W-pair and Z-pair cross-sections measured at LEP at s=161207 GeV, compared to SM predictions.

The most common\nset of parameters to describe the two vertices is g1Z , \u03bb\u03b3 and \u03ba\u03b3 , which\n\n\fconserve both C and P, and obey the SM gauge structure. The combined LEP2 data yields g1Z = 0.991 \u00b1 0.022, \u03bb\u03b3 = \u22120.016 \u00b1 0.022 and\n\u03ba\u03b3 = 0.984 \u00b1 0.045, therefore in agreement with the SM expectations\n\u03bb\u03b3 = 0 and \u03ba\u03b3 = g1Z = 1 at the 2-5% level [2].\nCharged QGC as WWZZ, WWZ\u03b3 and WW\u03b3\u03b3 are predicted in the\nSM but are beyond the sensitivity of the LEP2 data. Larger anomalous\ncontributions have been searched for in WW\u03b3 and \u03bd\u03bd\u03b3\u03b3 final states,\nleading to limits on the new physics scale of the anomalous contributions \u039b >5-10 GeV at 95% confidence level [2].\nNeutral TGC as ZZZ, ZZ\u03b3 and Z\u03b3\u03b3 do not exist in the SM but\npossible contributions have been searched for in Z pair, Zee and Z\u03b3\nevents. No evidence for neutral TGC has been found and parameterizing the vertices with the hVi and fiV (i = 1, 4 and V = \u03b3, Z) couplings,\nlimits have been set at the level hVi , fiV <0.05-0.20 at 95% confidence\nlevel [2].\nNeutral QGC also do not exist in the SM, but possible contributions\nof a ZZ\u03b3\u03b3 vertex have been searched for in the LEP2 data. Here the\nstudy of ZZ\u03b3 and \u03bd\u03bd\u03b3\u03b3 events allows to set limits on the new physics\nscale of the anomalous contributions again with \u039b >5-10 GeV at 95%\nconfidence level [2].\n\nReferences\n[1] S.L.
