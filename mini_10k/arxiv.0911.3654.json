The profiles represent the most extensive spectroscopic radial coverage for\nany dE galaxy, extending to a projected distance of eight half-light radii (8reff \u223c 14\u2032 ). We achieve\nthis coverage via Keck/DEIMOS multislit spectroscopic observations of 520 and 442 member red giant\nbranch stars in NGC 147 and NGC 185, respectively. In contrast to previous studies, we find that both\ndEs have significant internal rotation. We measure a maximum rotational velocity of 17 \u00b1 2 km s\u22121\nfor NGC 147 and 15 \u00b1 5 km s\u22121 for NGC 185. While both rotation profiles suggest a flattening in the\nouter regions, there is no indication that we have reached the radius of maximum rotation velocity.\nThe velocity dispersions decrease gently with radius with an average dispersion of 16 \u00b1 1 km s\u22121 for\nNGC 147 and 24 \u00b1 1 km s\u22121 for NGC 185. The average metallicity for NGC 147 is [Fe/H] = \u22121.1 \u00b1 0.1\nand for NGC 185 is [Fe/H] = \u22121.3 \u00b1 0.1; both dEs have internal metallicity dispersions of 0.5 dex, but\nshow no evidence for a radial metallicity gradient. We construct two-integral axisymmetric dynamical\nmodels and find that the observed kinematical profiles cannot be explained without modest amounts\nof non-baryonic dark matter. We measure central mass-to-light ratios of M/LV = 4.2 \u00b1 0.6 and\nM/LV = 4.6 \u00b1 0.6 for NGC 147 and NGC 185, respectively. Both dE galaxies are consistent with\nbeing primarily flattened by their rotational motions, although some anisotropic velocity dispersion\nis needed to fully explain their observed shapes. The velocity profiles of all three Local Group dEs\n(NGC 147, NGC 185 and NGC 205) suggest that rotation is more prevalent in the dE galaxy class\nthan previously assumed, but is often manifest only at several times the effective radius. Since all\ndEs outside the Local Group have been probed to only inside the effective radius, this opens the\ndoor for formation mechanisms in which dEs are transformed or stripped versions of gas-rich rotating\nprogenitor galaxies.\nSubject headings: galaxies: dwarf - galaxies: kinematics and dynamics - galaxies: individual\n(NGC 147, NGC 185)\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nDwarf elliptical (dE) galaxies are characterized by low\nsurface brightness (\u03bceff,V > 22 mag arcsec\u22122 ), little to\nno gas, and old to intermediate age stellar populations.\nThese galaxies are spatially clustered and account for\nmore than 75% of objects brighter than MV < \u221214\nin nearby galaxy clusters (Ferguson & Sandage 1991;\nFerguson & Binggeli 1994). Since there are few, if any,\nisolated dE galaxies, most proposed dE galaxy formation scenarios are environmentally-driven, such as via\ngas stripping or gravitational harassment of gas-rich spiral or dwarf irregular galaxies (e.g. Dekel & Silk 1986;\nMoore et al. 1998; Aguerri & Gonz\u00e1lez-Garc\u0131\u0301a 2009).\nRecent evidence for embedded stellar disks and bars in\nsome dEs support these scenarios (Jerjen et al. 2000;\nGeha et al. 2005; Lisker et al. 2006; Chilingarian et al.\n2007). Since gas-rich systems have significant rotation\nvelocities, a key test of this hypothesis class is comparing the kinematics of dE and gas-rich galaxies.\n1 Astronomy Department, Yale University, New Haven,\nCT 06520. marla.geha@yale.edu\n2 Space Telescope Science Institute, 3700 San Martin Drive,\nBaltimore, MD 21218\n3 UCO/Lick Observatory, University of California, Santa\nCruz, 1156 High Street, Santa Cruz, CA 95064.\n4 Department of Astronomy, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195-1580\n5 Hubble Fellow, California Institute of Technology, Department of Astronomy, 1200 E California Blvd, Pasadena, CA 91125\n\nInternal kinematic measurements for dEs in the Fornax and Virgo Cluster have revealed an unexpected dichotomy: roughly half of the observed dEs have significant rotation about the major-axis, while the remaining galaxies show no detectable major-axis rotation (Pedraz et al. 2002; Geha et al. 2003; van Zee et al.\n2004; de Rijcke et al. 2005). dE galaxies with no rotation\npresent a challenge to any scenario in which dE progenitors are gas-rich and thus rotating (Moore et al. 1998).\nRam pressure stripping alone does not affect the kinematics of the collisionless stellar component. Gravitational processes such as galaxy harassment can reduce\nthe amount of rotational angular momentum, converting\nthis into random velocity dispersion, however, simulations are unable to completely remove rotational support\n(Mayer et al. 2001; Mastropietro et al. 2005).\nBecause dEs have low surface brightnesses, integrated\nlight (long-slit) kinematic observations of dEs in both\ngalaxy clusters and the Local Group are currently limited to within the half-light effective radius (reff ). Thus,\nit is possible that significant rotational angular momentum lies at larger distances than has so far been explored.\nAddressing this question requires kinematics tracers at\nlarger radius. While the dynamics of dE globular cluster systems suggest that there may be significant rotation at large radius (Beasley et al. 2006, 2009), the small\nnumber of clusters limits the usefulness of this tracer.\nThe dEs in the Local Group share the same general\n\n\f2\n\nGeha et al.\n\nproperties as the more numerous dEs in galaxy clusters,\nhowever, their proximity allows us to resolve individual\nstars (Geha et al. 2006), and thus trace kinematics profiles down to arbitrarily low surface brightness and large\nradius.\nThe Local Group contains three dE galaxies, NGC 205,\nNGC 147 and NGC 185, which in addition to the compact elliptical M32, are the brightest satellites around\nthe spiral galaxy M 31. We follow the terminology conventions of, e.g. Bender et al. (1992), although alternatives are in use. While the differing terminologies can\nbe confusing, the key point is that NGC 205, NGC 147,\nand NGC 185 on the one hand, and M 32 on the other\nhand, should not be grouped in a single class. The former\nthree galaxies have fundamental plane properties that indicate similarity to galaxies in the dwarf spheroidal class\n(dSph). By contrast, galaxies such as M 32 have properties that indicate similarity to (giant) elliptical galaxies.\nThis likely indicates a difference in formation history, as\ndiscussed more fully in, e.g., Kormendy et al. (2009).\nThe prototype of the dE galaxy class is NGC 205\nwhich is in very close projection to M 31 (40\u2032 = 8 kpc).\nBoth photometric and kinematic evidence suggests that\nNGC 205 is tidally interacting with M 31 (Choi et al.\n2002; Geha et al. 2006), and may in fact be on its\nfirst orbital approach (Howley et al. 2008). In contrast, NGC 147 and NGC 185 lie at a projected distance of 7\u25e6 (\u223c 150 kpc) from M 31. While the metalpoor stellar halo of M 31 extends to this distance\n(Guhathakurta et al. 2005; Kalirai et al. 2006), its gravitational influence of M 31 is not expected to influence the\nkinematics of these dE satellites (see \u00a7 4.5). NGC 147 and\nNGC 185 are separated from each other by merely 58\u2032 ,\nleading to speculation that they may be a bound galaxy\npair (Baade 1944; van den Bergh 1998). An accurate\ndistance estimate suggests that these two galaxies are\nphysically separated by over 60 kpc (McConnachie et al.\n2005) and may not be bound (however, see \u00a7 4.5). The\nlarge observed distances between these two dEs and their\nparent M 31, combined with their relative proximity to\nthe Sun, make NGC 147 and NGC 185 the best available\ntargets for studying the properties of dE galaxies to large\nradius.\nNGC 147 and NGC 185 share several similar fundamental properties, such as absolute luminosity (MV \u223c\n\u221215.5), half-light radius (reff \u223c 2\u2032 = 0.3 kpc), and central\nvelocity dispersion (for exact values see Table 1). However, they differ markedly in many aspects. NGC 185\ncontains some gas, dust and evidence for recent star formation confined to its center (Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Delgado et al.\n1999), while NGC 147 is devoid of gas or dust and shows\nno sign of recent star formation activity (Young & Lo\n1997; Sage et al. 1998). An average metallicity of [Fe/H]\n= \u22121.4 is inferred for NGC 185 (Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Delgado et al.\n1999), while a more metal rich population of [Fe/H] =\n\u22121.0 is inferred for NGC 147 (Han et al. 1997; Davidge\n2005; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2007). HST/WFPC2 imaging of\nboth galaxies also implies the presence of intermediateage stars, with NGC 147 having a more significant contribution than NGC 185 (Butler & Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Delgado\n2005). Thus, while both dEs are dominated by old to\nintermediate-age stars, the metallicity and age mixture\nof these components are different in each galaxy.\nThe first spectroscopic long-slit observations of Local\n\nGroup dEs by Bender et al. (1991) suggested that while\nNGC 185 appeared supported entirely by random motions, NGC 147 had a significant rotational component\nof 6.5 \u00b1 1.1 km s\u22121 . Somewhat deeper observations by\nSimien & Prugniel (2002) extended the kinematic profiles out \u223c 2\u2032 (1reff ), but did not measure a significant\nrotation for either galaxy. In contrast, both studies measured a rotational component in NGC 205 (within the\ntidal radius), later confirmed by Geha et al. (2006) to\nbe 11 \u00b1 5 km s\u22121 . Using the Simien & Prugniel data,\nde Rijcke et al. (2006) constructed dynamical models for\nall three Local Group dEs, concluding that, within the\nhalf-light radii, all three galaxies have mass-to-light ratios above that expected from the stellar populations\nalone.\nIn this paper, we present accurate radial velocities\nout to 8 reff in the Local Group dE galaxies NGC 147\nand NGC 185, based on Keck/DEIMOS multi-slit spectroscopy for 520 and 442 red giant branch (RGB) stars,\nrespectively. The paper is organized as follows: in \u00a7 2 we\ndiscuss target selection for our DEIMOS slitmasks, the\nobserving procedure and data reduction. In \u00a7 3, we discuss the velocity, velocity dispersion and metallicity profiles. In \u00a7 4, we construct two-integral dynamical models\nfor these galaxies and discuss the best fit mass distribution and dark matter content. Finally, in \u00a7 5, we discuss\nthe implications of these results for the formation of dE\ngalaxies.\nThroughout this paper we adopt distance moduli determined by McConnachie et al. (2005) via the tip of the\nRGB method. The distance modulus for NGC 147 is\n(m \u2212 M )0 = 24.43 \u00b1 0.04 (675 \u00b1 27 kpc) and NGC 185\nis (m \u2212 M )0 = 24.23 \u00b1 0.03 (616 \u00b1 26 kpc). This places\nNGC 147 and NGC 185 at projected distances of 140 and\n185 kpc from their parent galaxy M 31, respectively.\n2. DATA\n2.1. Target Selection\nIndividual stars in NGC 147 and NGC 185 were targeted for spectroscopy according to their probability of\nbeing a RGB star based on Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope CFH12K mosaic imaging in the R- and I-bands\n(Battinelli & Demers 2004a,b). The CCD mosaic covers\na 42\u2032 \u00d7 28\u2032 region centered on each galaxy with 0.206\u2032\u2032\npixels. Stellar photometry from these images extends\n2 mag below the tip of the RGB. The spatial distribution\nof stars is shown in Figure 1. Color-magnitude diagrams\nare shown in Figure 2.\nThe absolute magnitude of the RGB for a metal-poor\nstellar population is MI \u223c \u22124. At the assumed distance\nand reddening of NGC 147 and NGC 185, the apparent\nmagnitude of the RGB population is Io \u223c 20.3 (see Figure 2). Since internal metallicity variations will cause\na spread in the colors of RGB stars, we select spectroscopic targets based primarily on apparent magnitude\nrather than color. We note there is a 0.1-0.2 mag photometric zero-point error between individual CCD chips\nin the CFHT photometry which we discovered after our\nspectroscopic observations were completed. While this\nled us to use an alternative dataset to determine the surface brightness profiles in \u00a7 4.1, the error had little to no\naffect on our targeting efficiencies.\nFor both dEs, highest priority in the spectroscopic tar-\n\n\fLocal Group dE Dynamics\n\n3\n\nFig. 1.- Palomar Sky Survey images of the two Local Group dE galaxies, NGC 147 (left) and NGC 185 (right).

To minimize Galactic foreground contamination, targets were required to have (R \u2212 I)o > 0.2.\nStars with photometric errors larger than \u03c3I > 0.1\nwere rejected, as were stars having neighbors of equal\nor greater brightness within a radius r < 4\u2032\u2032 . The photometric criteria used for spectroscopic target selection are\nshown in Figure 2.\nSlitmasks were created using the DEIMOS dsimulator\nslitmask design software. For each slitmask the software\nfills in the mask area to the extent possible with the highest priority input targets. It then fills in the remaining\nspace on the slitmask with lower priority targets. The\nspecifics of each mask are listed in Table 2.\n2.2. Observations and Data Reduction\nThe data were taken with the Keck II 10-m telescope\nand the DEIMOS spectrograph (Faber et al. 2003). Four\nmultislit masks were observed in NGC 147 on the nights\nof August 28 and September 5-7, 2005. Five masks were\nobserved in NGC 185 on September 16, 2006. Mask positions, exposure times and other observing details are\ngiven in Table 2. The masks were observed with the\n1200 line mm\u22121 grating covering a wavelength region\n6400 \u2212 9100\u00c5. The spectral dispersion of this setup is\n0.33\u00c5, and the resulting spectral resolution, taking into\naccount the anamorphic distortion, is 1.37\u00c5 (FWHM,\nequivalent to 47 km s\u22121 at the Ca II triplet). The spatial\nscale is 0.12\u2032\u2032 per pixel and slitlets were 0.7\u2032\u2032 wide. The\nminimum slit length was 4\u2032\u2032 which allows adequate sky\nsubtraction; the minimum spatial separation between slit\nends was 0.4\u2032\u2032 (three pixels).\nSpectra were reduced using a modified version of the\nspec2d software pipeline (version 1.1.4) developed by the\nDEEP2 team at the University of California-Berkeley\nfor that survey. A detailed description of the twodimensional reductions can be found in Simon & Geha\n(2007). The final one-dimensional spectra are rebinned\ninto logarithmic wavelength bins with 15 km s\u22121 per\n\npixel. An example DEIMOS spectrum taken with the\nsame settings is shown in Figure 4 of Geha et al. (2006).\n2.3. Radial Velocities and Error Estimates\nRadial velocities were measured by cross-correlating\nthe observed science spectra with a series of high signalto-noise stellar templates. Stellar templates were observed with Keck/DEIMOS using the same setup as described in \u00a7 2.2 and cover a wide range of stellar types (F8\nto M8 giants, subgiants and dwarf stars) and metallicities ([Fe/H] = \u22122.12 to +0.11). We calculate and apply\na telluric correction to each science spectrum by cross\ncorrelating a hot stellar template with the night sky absorption lines following the method in Sohn et al. (2007).\nThe telluric correction accounts for the velocity error due\nto mis-centering the star within the 0.7\u2032\u2032 slit caused by\nsmall mask rotations or astrometric errors. We apply\nboth a telluric and heliocentric correction to all velocities presented in this paper.\nWe determine the random component of our velocity\nerrors using a Monte Carlo bootstrap method. Noise is\nadded to each pixel in the one-dimensional science spectrum, we then recalculate the velocity and telluric correction for 1000 noise realizations. Error bars are defined\nas the square root of the variance in the recovered mean\nvelocity in the Monte Carlo simulations. The systematic contribution to the velocity error was determined by\nSimon & Geha (2007) to be 2.2 km s\u22121 based on repeated\nindependent measurements of individual stars. The systematic error contribution is expected to be constant\nas the spectrograph setup and velocity cross-correlation\nroutines are identical. We add the random and systematic errors in quadrature to arrive at the final velocity\nerror for each science measurement. Radial velocities\nwere successfully measured for 1227 of the 1483 extracted\nspectra across the nine observed DEIMOS masks. The\nmajority of spectra for which we could not measure a\nredshift did not have sufficient signal-to-noise. The fitted velocities were visually inspected to ensure reliability.\n2.4. Membership Criteria\n\n\f4\n\nGeha et al.\n\nFig. 2.- Color-magnitude diagrams for NGC 147 (left) and NGC 185 (right) based on Battinelli & Demers (2004a,b) R- and I-band\nCHFT12K photometry, corrected for extinction, in a 42\u2032 \u00d7 28\u2032 region centered on each galaxy. Blue circles are Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopically confirmed members of each galaxy, open squares are non-members. The numbered regions indicate the location of our primary (1),\nsecondary (2), and tertiary (3) spectroscopic priorities.\n\nThe expected velocity distributions of NGC 147 and\nNGC 185 overlap with both the stellar velocity distribution of the M31 halo and the foreground Milky Way disk\nand halo. Thus, a simple velocity cut is not sufficient to\ndefine membership in these dE galaxies. We determine\nmembership in NGC 147 and NGC 185 using a modified version of the probability method of Gilbert et al.\n(2006). This method computes a membership probability for each star based on the assumption that dE stars\nhave different physical properties than the contaminating\nforeground and background populations.\nThe Gilbert et al. (2006) method computes the probability that a given star is either a RGB star at the\ndistance of NGC 147 or NGC 185, or a foreground\nMilky Way dwarf star based on the star's location in\nfour spectroscopic and photometric diagnostics: line of\nsight velocity, strength of the surface-gravity sensitive\nNa II absorption line at \u223c 8190\u00c5, position in a colormagnitude diagram, and a comparison of photometric\n(CMD-based) and spectroscopic (based on the Ca II\ntriplet at \u223c 8500\u00c5) metallicity estimates. A star's position in a diagnostic is compared to probability distribution functions based on appropriate training sets to\ndetermine the likelihood the star is a RGB or foreground\ndwarf star. The likelihoods from the individual diagnostics are then combined to produce an overall likelihood.\nFor the present analysis, several modifications were\nmade to the method published in Gilbert et al. (2006),\nwhich was optimized to identify red giant branch stars\nin the halo of M31. Several of the diagnostics utilize\nJohnson-Cousins V and I magnitudes, while the dE photometry was taken in the R and I bands. The CMD\ndiagnostic and spectroscopic versus photometric metallicity diagnostic were re-derived using VandenBerg et al.\n(2006) isochrones in (I, R \u2212 I) shifted to the distance\nof each dE. To utilize the Na II diagnostic, VandenBerg isochrones were used to define a relation between\nR \u2212 I and V \u2212 I, which was then used to derive a V \u2212 I\ncolor for each star. The velocity distribution of each dE\nis modeled as a Gaussian, with a constant velocity dis-\n\npersion and a central velocity that varies with distance\nalong the semi-major axis. We expect little contamination from M 31 halo stars at these radii (< 1 star per\nmask; Guhathakurta et al. 2005).\nStars that are more than three times more likely to be\na red giant branch star at the distance of the dE than a\nforeground dwarf star, and which have a spatial position\nand line-of-sight velocity consistent with that of the dE,\nare classified as members. Given these membership criteria, we identify 520 and 442 RGB star as members of the\ndE galaxies NGC 147 and NGC 185, respectively. Velocities and velocities errors for individual member stars\nare listed in Tables 6 and 7 in the electronic version of\nthe paper, or on request from the authors.\n3. RESULTS\n\nThe measured velocities of individual stars allow us\nto probe the dynamics of NGC 147 and NGC 185 to\nmuch larger radius than possible via integrated-light\nspectroscopy. In order to compare to previous results,\nand to construct dynamical models, we bin the individual velocity measurements based on their major-axis distance x, using bin widths \u2206x = 2.05\u2032 for NGC 147 and\n\u2206x = 1.87\u2032 for NGC 185. The bin widths were chosen\nto roughly match the effective radius of each dE. The\nbin with integer index number i spans values of x from\n(i \u2212 12 )\u2206x to (i + 12 )\u2206x. The value of x for each star was\ncalculated using spherical trigonometry and a zenithal\nprojection, using the galaxy center positions and major\naxis position angles (Table 1 and 3); positive radii lie on\nthe North-East side of each galaxy.\nWe analyze our kinematic data following the procedure\ndescribed in Appendix A of van der Marel & Anderson\n(2009). For each bin number i we calculated the weighted\nmean velocity Vi of the individual stellar velocities vj ,\nand its formal error \u2206Vi . Individual weights were set\nequal to the quadrature sum of the observational velocity errors \u2206vj and the velocity dispersion \u03c3i for the given\nbin. The latter was determined by finding the value that\nmaximizes the likelihood of the set of velocity residuals\nvj \u2212 Vi . The formal error \u2206\u03c3i was calculated using a\n\n\fLocal Group dE Dynamics\n\n5\n\nFig. 3.- (Top) Individual velocities as a function of semi-major axis distance for dE member stars (blue circles) and non-members (open\nsquares) of NGC 147 (left) and NGC 185 (right).

The systemic radial velocity,\nVsys , for each galaxy was determined by finding the value\nthat provides the lowest \u03c72 when the dynamical models\ndescribed in \u00a7 4 were fit to the data and is subtracted\nfrom each of the binned major-axis velocities Vi . The systemic velocity for NGC 147 is Vsys = \u2212193.1\u00b10.8 km s\u22121\nand Vsys = \u2212203.8\u00b11.1 km s\u22121 for NGC 185. This is consistent with literature values from Bender et al. (1991)\nand the velocity compilation from the NASA Extragalactic Database.\nTo further improve the signal-to-noise ratio we folded\nthe profiles above by taking the weighted average of bins\non opposite sides of the galaxy (i.e., bins i and \u2212i), using\nthe expected anti-symmetry and symmetry of the rotation and dispersion profiles, respectively. Values of the\nobserved Vrms and their formal errors were obtained by\nadding the results for V and \u03c3 in quadrature. The full\nkinematic profiles are shown in Figure 3; the folded profiles are shown in Figure 5.\n3.1. The Velocity Profiles and Rotation in dE Galaxies\n\nWe present the major-axis velocity profiles for our two\ndEs in Figure 3. The profiles extend to slightly more\nthan 14\u2032 in each galaxy, equivalent to 7 reff and 9 reff in\n\nNGC 147 and NGC 185, respectively. Previous kinematic\nobservations for each dE have been limited to within one\nreff (Simien & Prugniel 2002). In Figure 3, a clear rotation signal is seen even in the individual unbinned velocity distribution of stars. The binned major-axis velocity profiles in this figure show a well-defined rotation\ncurve profile. The maximum observed rotational velocity is 17 \u00b1 2 km s\u22121 and 15 \u00b1 5 km s\u22121 for NGC 147 and\nNGC 185, determined from the maximum data point in\nthe folded rotation curves (Figure 5). While our velocity\nprofiles flatten at large radius, it is unlikely that, even\nat these large radial distances, we have reached the maximum rotation velocity in these galaxies. The velocity\ndispersion profiles in both dEs decline gently with radius.\nThe weighted average values are \u03c3 = 16 \u00b1 1 km s\u22121 and\n24 \u00b1 1 km s\u22121 for NGC 147 and NGC 185, respectively.\nThe significant rotation velocities we measure are in\nfact consistent with literature results of little to no rotation. Previous observations of NGC 147 and NGC 185\nwere limited to within 2\u2032 , corresponding to the inner three data points of Figure 3. Fitting a simple\nstraight line to our inner data points, we predict a\nrotation velocity of merely 0.8 km s\u22121 at this radius\nfor NGC 185, well below the observational errors of\nboth Bender et al. (1991) and Simien & Prugniel (2002),\n\n\f6\n\nGeha et al.\n\nand fully consistent with their conclusion of no rotation. For NGC 147, we predict a rotation velocity of\n4.3 km s\u22121 within 2\u2032 . This is marginally inconsistent\nwith both Simien & Prugniel (2002) who found no rotation at this radius, and Bender et al. (1991) who measured 6.5 \u00b1 1.1 km s\u22121 , but is consistent with the average\nof these two observations. Our discovery of rotation at\nradii larger than reff has significant implications for studies of more distant dE galaxies. We will discuss this issue\nfurther below and in \u00a7 5.\nEarly kinematic observations of the Local Group dEs\n(Davies et al. 1983; Bender et al. 1991) established the\nparadigm that dE galaxies are supported by anisotropic\nvelocity dispersions, in contrast to low-luminosity elliptical galaxies which are rotationally-supported. Our observations show that the Local Group dEs do indeed have\nsignificant rotational support. To demonstrate this, we\ncompare the ratio of the observed and predicted values of the maximum rotational velocity to the average\nvelocity dispersion using the quantity (Vmax /\u03c3)\u2217 . For\na rotationally-supported oblate galaxy, (Vmax /\u03c3)\u2217 = 1;\nvalues less than unity imply anisotropic-support. Using the measured ellipticity of each dE (Table 1), the\nmeasured maximum rotation velocity and the average velocity dispersion values from above, we compute\n(Vmax /\u03c3)\u2217 = 0.95 for NGC 147 and (Vmax /\u03c3)\u2217 = 0.91\nfor NGC 185. Because our observed maximum rotational\nvelocities are lower limits on the true maximum rotation,\nthese (Vmax /\u03c3)\u2217 values are also lower limits to the true\nvalues. For the third dE in the Local Group, NGC 205,\nwe measured (Vmax /\u03c3)\u2217 = 0.3 in Geha et al. (2006). The\noriginal value for NGC 205 may have been somewhat\nlarger given that the outer parts of this galaxy have\nbeen tidal disrupted by interactions with M 31. Thus,\nwhile the majority of kinematic support for the observed\nshapes of the Local Group dE galaxies comes from rotation, some anisotropic velocity dispersions are needed\nto fully explain the observed shapes. This is consistent\nwith our dynamical modeling results in \u00a7 4.3.\n3.2. Metallicity\n\nWe measure the spectroscopic metallicities ([Fe/H]) of\nindividual RGB stars based on the Ca II triplet absorption lines near \u03bb = 8500 \u00c5 . This method relies on an empirical calibration to Galactic globular clusters and is reliable for metallicities above [Fe/H]> \u22122.5 (Kirby et al.\n2008), which is the case for our member stars. We calculate the equivalent widths (EWs) of the three Ca II absorption lines using the line and continuum definitions of\nRutledge et al. (1997a) and convert this to [Fe/H] using\nthe empirical calibration relationship of Rutledge et al.\n(1997b). We determine the error on the [Fe/H] values\nwith the Monte Carlo method described in \u00a7 2.3, and add\nin quadrature a systematic uncertainty of 0.3 \u00c5 as determined in Simon & Geha (2007). We restrict this analysis to stellar spectra with signal-to-noise ratio greater or\nequal to 5 per pixel.\nThe binned metallicity profiles for NGC 147 and\nNGC 185 are shown in the bottom panels of Figure 3. For NGC 147, we find an average metallicity of [Fe/H]= \u22121.1 \u00b1 0.1 and for NGC 185 we find\n[Fe/H]= \u22121.3 \u00b1 0.1. This is in agreement with previous measurements from a variety of sources, includ-\n\ning photometric and spectroscopic metallicity estimates\n(Han et al. 1997; Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Delgado et al. 1999; Davidge\n2005; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2007). While the mean metallicity\nis well determined, there is significant internal metallicity\ndispersion of 0.5 dex in each galaxy, assuming a Gaussian\nmetallicity distribution function. Although the metallicity distribution function is asymmetric, given our errors\nthe assumption of a Gaussian distribution is justified. In\nFigure 3, we plot both the error on the mean (barred\nerror bars) in each radial bin and the internal metallicity dispersion (unbarred errors). Despite our significant\nradial coverage, we do not find evidence for radial metallicity gradients.\n4. DYNAMICAL MODELING\n\nWe have constructed a set of dynamical models to provide an initial interpretation of the data. The software\nwas developed by van der Marel et al. (1994) for modeling of the Local Group galaxy M32 and used more\nrecently in van der Marel & van Dokkum (2007a). The\nmodels assume a two-integral form of the distribution\nfunction and are used to fit the binned profiles in Figure 5. Binning results some information loss and methods do exist to model unbinned data (e.g. Strigari et al.\n2008; Chanam\u00e9 et al. 2008; Coccato et al. 2009), however we chose to bin the kinematic data here primarily to facilitate comparisons to previous work on these\ngalaxies. A full analysis of this dataset should preferably\navoid spatial binning of the data, restrictive use of only\nthe lowest-order velocity moments and allow for a more\ngeneral form of the distribution function. We intend to\nconstruct such models in a future paper using the discrete Schwarzschild method of Chanam\u00e9 et al. (2008).\nOur present models are based on solutions of the Jeans\nequations of hydrostatic equilibrium with the following\nassumptions: (1) an oblate axisymmetric geometry with\na constant axial ratio; (2) a constant mass-to-light ratio M/L; and (3) a two-integral distribution function\nof the form f = f (E, Lz ), where E is the energy and\nLz the angular momentum around the symmetry axis.\n2 \u2261 v 2 , so they can be\nTwo-integral models have vR\nz\nthought of as the axisymmetric generalization of spherical isotropic models. A summary of the equations on\nwhich the models are based is provided in Section 2 of\nvan der Marel & van Dokkum (2007a). We do not repeat this here, but focus instead on the specific application to NGC 147 and NGC 185. Quantities for these\ngalaxies that are relevant to the models are listed in Table 3 and are discussed below.\n4.1. Brightness and Density Profiles\nThe modeling starts with the observed surface photometry of each galaxy. While the CFHT data discussed\nin \u00a7 2.1 are appropriate for measuring surface brightness\nprofiles, an unrecoverable calibration error resulted in a\nsignificant zero-point error between CCDs. Instead, we\nuse the data presented by Kent (1987) in the Gunn rband. We transformed the Kent major-axis data to the\nJohnson V -band using the (B \u2212 V ) colors from the RC3\n(see Table 3) combined with the transformation equation V \u2212 r = 0.486(B \u2212 V ) \u2212 0.273 (Jorgensen 1994).\nThe resulting surface brightness profiles, corrected for\nextinction (Schlegel et al. 1998), are shown in Figure 4\n\n\fLocal Group dE Dynamics\nNGC 147\n\n7\n\nNGC 185\n\n18\n\n18\n\n20\n\n20\n\n22\n\n22\n\n24\n\n24\n\n26\n\n26\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n0\n\n2\n\nx (arcmin)\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nx (arcmin)\n\n18\n\n18\n\n20\n\n20\n\n22\n\n22\n\n24\n\n24\n\n26\n\n26\n\n28\n\n28\n\n30\n\n30\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nlog(x[arcmin])\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nlog(x[arcmin])\n\nFig. 4.- Extinction-corrected V -band surface brightness profiles in mag/arcsec2 of NGC 147 (left) and NGC 185 (right). Black dots\nshow the data from Kent (1987), transformed to the V -band. Data inside of 1.5 times the seeing FWHM were ignored. The top panels\nhave the linear major-axis radius x along the abscissa, while the bottom panels have log(x) along the abscissa. Red curves in the top panels\nare the best Sersic-profile fits to the data. Red dots in the bottom panels show the Sersic extrapolation of the data to larger radii. Blue\ncurves in the bottom panels are the predictions of the best-fitting luminosity density parameterization j(R, z) in equation (1). Parameters\nof the fits are listed in Table 3.\n\nand extend to 5.3\u2032 and 6.8\u2032 for NGC 147 and NGC 185,\nrespectively. For both galaxies this is less than half the\nextent of our kinematical data. To extrapolate the photometry to larger radii we determined the best-fitting\nSersic profiles, which are over-plotted in the top panels of\nFigure 4. The profiles fit the data well, with RMS residuals of 0.04 and 0.08 mag for NGC 147 and NGC 185,\nrespectively.\nWe set the apparent axial ratio qa (qa = 1 \u2212 \u01eb) equal to\nthe average of the observed axial ratios in the radial range\n1\u2032 \u2212 5\u2032 (see Table 3). Any systematic variations in axial\nratio over this radial range are small in both galaxies\n(. 0.1; Kent 1987). The total apparent magnitude, V0 ,\ncalculated using this axial ratio and our best fitting Sersic\nmodel above agree with that in the RC3 catalog to within\n\u223c 0.1\u20130.2 magnitudes for each dE galaxy. This provides\nadded confidence in the use of Sersic extrapolations at\nlarge radii.\nThe inclination of each dE is not well constrained by\nthe data, however, both the predicted kinematical profiles and the inferred M/L are generally insensitive to the\nassumed inclination (e.g. van der Marel & van Dokkum\n2007a,b). The distribution of intrinsic axial ratios qt for\nelliptical galaxies is known (Tremblay & Merritt 1995),\n\nand we assume this distribution for our dEs. We use this\ndistribution as in van der Marel & van Dokkum (2007a)\nto calculate the statistically most likely inclination. Since\nNGC 147 appears flatter on the sky than NGC 185, its\nmost likely inclination is closer to edge-on (i = 78\u25e6 ) than\nthat for NGC 185 (i = 64\u25e6 ). The intrinsic axial ratios\nqt corresponding to these assumed inclinations are given\nin Table 3. We discuss the dependence on inclination in\n\u00a7 4.4.\nWe parameterize the three-dimensional luminosity\ndensity as:\nj(R, z) = j0 (\n\nm\nm \u03b1\n) [1 + ( )2 ]\u03b4 ,\nb\nb\n\nm2 \u2261 R2 + z 2 qt\u22122 . (1)\n\nHere z is the symmetry axis of the galaxy and (R, \u03c6, z)\nare the usual cylindrical coordinates. We fit the projected surface brightness (obtained by numerical lineof-sight integration of j) to the combination of the\nKent (1987) data and its Sersic-profile extrapolation to\n20\u2032 . The surface brightness profile fits are shown in the\nbottom panels of Figure 4 and the model parameters are\nlisted in Table 3. These results are independent of the\nassumed inclination, although j0 depends on inclination\nthrough the ratio (qt /qa ), as well as on the adopted dis-\n\n\f8\n\nGeha et al.\n\ntances. The surface brightness models fit the extrapolated profiles adequately, with RMS residuals out to 20\u2032\nof 0.06 and 0.10 mag for NGC 147 and NGC 185, respectively.\n4.2. Dynamics\n\nGiven the j(R, z) luminosity density, we assume a\nconstant M/L to calculate the gravitational potential.\nWe then solve the Jeans equations to determine the intrinsic dynamical quantities, followed by a luminosityweighted line-of-sight projection to calculate observable\nquantities. In particular, the models yield the quantity\nVrms \u2261 [V 2 + \u03c3 2 ]1/2 , where V is the mean velocity and\n\u03c3 is the velocity dispersion. The quantity Vrms scales\nlinearly with (M/L)1/2 , but its spatial and radial dependence are otherwise uniquely determined. The quantities V and \u03c3 can also be predicted separately, but this\nrequires the introduction of a free parameter (or function) k that specifies how the second azimuthal velocity\nmoment separates into mean and random components:\n2 ]1/2 .\nv\u03c6 = k[v\u03c62 \u2212 vR\n\n(2)\n\nFor k = 0 the model is non-rotating, whereas for |k| = 1\nthe velocity dispersion tensor is isotropic and the model\nis a so-called \"oblate isotropic rotator\". The quantity k\nis therefore similar to the quantity (V /\u03c3)\u2217 discussed is\n\u00a7 3.1, with the difference that k is defined locally while\n(V /\u03c3)\u2217 is defined in terms of globally averaged projected\nquantities.\n4.3. Data-Model Comparison\nFor proper comparison to the data, the model predictions were binned on the sky in rectangles of size \u2206x\u00d7\u2206y.\nHere y is the minor-axis direction. The quantity \u2206y\nwas taken to be the approximate extent of the region\naround the major-axis over which data was obtained. For\nNGC 185 we also took into account that the observed\nstars are on average somewhat offset by \u03b4y \u2248 \u22121.5\u2032 from\nthe major-axis (Figure 1). No luminosity weighting was\napplied in calculation of the binned model predictions,\nsince the observed stars are distributed approximately\nhomogeneously in each bin.\nThe value of M/L was chosen to best-fit the folded\nVrms profile near the galaxy center, which in practice was\nchosen to be the region inside 4\u2032 . We determine mass-tolight ratios of M/LV = 4.2 \u00b1 0.6 and M/LV = 4.6 \u00b1 0.6\nfor NGC 147 and NGC 185, respectively. The value of k\nin our models was chosen to best fit the rotation curve\nat all available radii. The parameters of the best-fitting\nmodels are listed in Table 3. Figure 5 compares the corresponding model predictions to the observed kinematical\nprofiles. We discuss the M/L values further in \u00a7 4.4.\nFor NGC 147, the predicted profile provides a statistically acceptable match to the Vrms data (\u03c72 = 3.8 for 8\ndegrees of freedom or \u03c72\u03bd = 0.5 ). Although the M/L was\nchosen to only optimize the fit near the center, the predicted profile fits the full observed profile out to the last\nmeasured data point. Hence, even data out to \u223c 7.3reff\nprovides no evidence for an increase in M/L with radius. By contrast, for NGC 185, the predicted Vrms profile does not provide a statistically acceptable match to\nthe data. The fit is reasonable inside 4\u2032 , since the M/L\n\nwas chosen to optimize the fit there. However, for the\ndata points outside of this radius the observed weighted\naverage Vrms = 23.0 \u00b1 1.1 km s\u22121 . The average model\nprediction at these radii is Vrms = 20.6 km s\u22121 . Therefore, the observations exceed the model predictions at\nlarge radii with 2.2\u03c3 significance. The most natural interpretation of this result is that the M/L of NGC 185 is\nincreasing with radius, although tides may also produce\nthis affect (see \u00a7 4.5).\nThe predicted rotation curves for both galaxies provide\na statistically acceptable match to the data (\u03c72 = 11.9\nand 7.6, for 8 and 7 degrees of freedom, for NGC 147 and\nNGC 185, respectively). However, inspection of the predicted rotation curves shows that they may be slightly\ntoo high at small radii and slightly too low at large radii.\nThis could easily be improved by choosing k to be an\nincreasing function of radius. This would be no less arbitrary than choosing it to have a constant value as a function of radius, as we have done here. If the model also\nprovides a statistically acceptable fit to Vrms , as is the\ncase for NGC 147, then this guarantees that the velocity\ndispersion \u03c3 is fit as well. By contrast, for NGC 185 an\nincrease of M/L with radius might be a more natural\nway to improve the fit to the rotation curve, given the\nVrms results. The best-fitting k values in Table 3 indicate\nthat while both galaxies have significant rotation rates,\nneither galaxy rotates fast enough to account for its flattening. Hence, the velocity dispersion tensors must be\nanisotropic, in agreement with our conclusion from \u00a7 3.1.\nThe fact that NGC 147 is well fit by a constant-M/L\ntwo-integral model does not mean that it is not embedded in a dark halo. The profile of Vrms with radius is\nalmost flat. So it is likely that models with a logarithmic gravitational potential can fit the data equally well.\nConversely, the fact that NGC 185 is not well fit by\nconstant M/L two-integral model does not mean that\nit necessarily must have a dark halo. It may be possible to fit the data with a constant-M/L model that has\na different velocity dispersion anisotropy than assumed\nhere. Alternatively, our assumption of dynamical equilibrium may be incorrect for NGC 185 at large radius and\nwe discuss the possibility of tidal interactions in \u00a7 4.5.\nIn principle it is possible to constrain the velocity dispersion anisotropy independent of the assumed gravitational potential by using information on deviations of the\nline-of-sight velocity distributions from Gaussians (e.g.,\nCarollo et al. 1995; Rix et al. 1997). To further explore\nthese issues, we intend to use the discrete Schwarzschild\nmethod of Chaname et al. (2009) to construct dynamical\nmodels with three-integral distribution function, including a dark halo (i.e., M/L varying with radius), which\nwill avoid spatial binning of the data. Such models will\nnot necessarily yield smaller error bars or better constraints on quantities of interest (such as the mass-tolight ratio or presence of a dark halo), given the limited\nnumber of stars available to trace the kinematics. However, they will have the benefit of yielding more rigorous\nerror bars and constraints, which include, e.g., modeling\nuncertainties due to the unknown velocity anisotropy and\nradial mass-to-light ratio profiles of these systems.\n4.4. Mass-to-Light Ratios\n\nWe compare our inferred M/L ratios with stellar\npopulation models to determine whether or not non-\n\n\fLocal Group dE Dynamics\n\n9\n\nFig. 5.- Major-axis kinematics of NGC 147 (left) and NGC 185 (right). Black dots show the binned results extracted from our data as\ndescribed in the text. Black curves show the predictions of the best-fitting f (E, Lz ) models. Parameters of the fits are listed in Table 3.\nThe top panels provide evidence for an M/L increase with radius in NGC 185, but not in NGC 147.\n\nFig. 6.- M/LB versus extinction corrected color (B \u2212 V )0 . Observed values for NGC 147 (red) and NGC 185 (blue) are shown as data\npoints with error bars. Curves show model predictions from Charlot & Bruzual (2007) for the IMFs from Chabrier (2003; left) and Salpeter\n(1955; right). Each curve is for a fixed metallicity Z and connects the predictions of simple stellar populations of fixed age. Solid circles\nindicate ages of 10 Gyr for each metallicity. The predicted curves extend up to the age of the Universe (13.73 Gyr; Spergel et al. 2007).\nBlack curves are, from left to right, Z = 0.0001, 0.0004, 0.004, and 0.008. The red and blue curves shows the interpolation of these curves\nto the metallicity appropriate for NGC 147 and NGC 185, respectively. We note for the preferred Chabrier IMF, the inferred M/LB ratios\nof these dE galaxies cannot be explained via their stellar content alone.\n\nbaryonic dark matter is needed to explain our observed kinematics. Despite our restrictive model assumptions, our resulting M/L values are likely very robust. Both van der Marel & van Dokkum (2007b) and\nCappellari et al. (2006) have compared the results of several dynamical modeling studies, showing that different\nmodeling approaches produced consistent M/L ratios to\nwithin a systematic accuracy of \u223c 5%. This is true despite the use of varying data sets (long-slit and integral\nfield data) and modeling approaches (two- and three-\n\nintegral models, and models with and without dark halos). In the context our models, we have further explored\nthe robustness of our inferred M/L values by constructing models with a range of inclinations (from edge-on to\ninclinations corresponding to models as flat as qt = 0.4).\nConsistent with previous studies we find that both the\nM/L values and the predicted profiles of Vrms with radius\nare insensitive to the assumed inclination (well within the\nerror bars). We also explored models with different ways\nof extrapolating Kent's (1987) surface brightness data to\n\n\f10\n\nGeha et al.\n\nlarger radii. Again, we found the effect on the M/L values and the predicted profiles of Vrms with radius to be\nwell within the error bars.\nWe first compare our M/L values to those of\nde Rijcke et al. (2006) who modeled NGC 147 and\nNGC 185 using a three-integral method. For the comparison, we transform our M/LV values to the B-band. The\nB-band values were obtained from the modeled V -band\nvalues using the galaxy (B \u2212 V )0 color (Table 3) and the\nsolar color (B\u2212V )\u2299 = 0.65. The de Rijcke et al. value for\nNGC 147, M/LB = 4.0+3.2\n\u22122.4 , is consistent with our result.\nHowever, their value for NGC 185, M/LB = 3.0+1.0\n\u22120.7 , is\nlower than our result at 1.5\u03c3 significance. The underlying\nreason for this may be that NGC 185 has an increasing\nM/L with radius, as suggested by Figure 5. The bestfitting M/L is then likely to depend on the radial extent\nof the data, which is larger for our data set than for the\nintegrated-light measurements of de Rijcke et al. (2006).\nFigure 6 shows the mass-to-light ratio M/LB for each\ndE versus the extinction corrected color (B \u2212 V )0 . We\ncompare these measurements to the stellar population\npredictions of Charlot & Bruzual (2007, priv. comm.)\nwhich is an updated version of their Bruzual & Charlot\n(2003) models. The [Fe/H] metallicities, determined in\n\u00a7 3.2, are Z = 0.0015 ([Fe/H] = \u22121.1) for NGC 147 and\nZ = 0.0009 ([Fe/H] = \u22121.3) for NGC 185 which assumes\na solar composition of Z\u2299 = 0.0189 (Anders & Grevesse\n1989). The predictions at these metallicities are overplotted in Figure 6 for both the initial mass functions (IMFs) of Chabrier (2003) and Salpeter (1955)\nover the range from 0.1\u2013100 M\u2299 . For the Chabrier\nIMF, the maximum M/LB ratio at the metallicity of\nNGC 147 and NGC 185 is attained for a population as old as the Universe (13.73 Gyr; Spergel et al.\n2007) with values M/LB,max = 2.5 and 2.3, respectively. This is not as high as observed, so for the\nChabrier IMF one must invoke the presence of nonbaryonic dark matter to fit the observed M/LB values. The Salpeter IMF tracks, while closer to the observations, are only marginally consistent with observations for very old stellar populations. Stellar population studies suggest significant intermediate age stellar populations in both dEs (Butler & Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Delgado\n2005), thus the Salpeter IMF also implies the presence\nof dark matter. The Chabrier IMF is now generally\npreferred over the Salpeter IMF, as the latter has too\nmany stars at low masses to properly fit real populations\n(e.g., Bell & de Jong 2000; Chabrier 2003). Therefore,\nthe high observed M/L values in NGC 147 and NGC 185\nmust be due at least in part to the presence of dark matter.\nFigure 7 shows M/LB versus the velocity dispersion\n\u03c3. For NGC 147 and NGC 185 we use along the abscissa\nthe weighted average Vrms inside 4\u2032 , as listed in Table 1.\nFor comparison we show in Figure 7 the sample of (giant) elliptical galaxies compiled by van der Marel & van\nDokkum (2007b). The latter follow a tight linear relation\nof the form M/LB \u221d \u03c3. The dE galaxies NGC 147 and\nNGC 185 clearly do not follow this relation. This result\nis not specific to these two dE galaxies. For comparison\nwe plot also the results for NGC 205 from Geha et al.\n(2006), and for six dE galaxies in Virgo from Geha et\nal. (2002). These all fall in the same region of the plot.\n\nFig. 7.- M/LB versus velocity dispersion \u03c3. Observed values\nfor NGC 147 and NGC 185 are shown in red and green respectively.\nCyan and blue data points are other dE galaxies from de Rijcke et\nal. (2006) and Geha et al. (2002), respectively. Black data points\nare giant ellipticals from the compilation of van der Marel & van\nDokkum (2007b).\n\nThe same distinction between dwarf and giant ellipticals\nis also revealed by plots of the fundamental plane; see e.g.\nthe plot of \u03ba3 vs. \u03ba1 in Geha et al. (2003). A traditional\ninterpretation of this is that it indicates a fundamental\ndistinction between dwarf and giant ellipticals. However,\nGraham & Guzman (2003) have proposed more recently\nthat there is actually a continuous sequence between the\ntwo, with the upturn in M/L towards dE galaxies driven\nby the fact that their Sersic n parameter is lower than for\ngiant ellipticals. Either way, it is clear from Figure 7 that\ndE galaxies have M/L values that are similar to those of\nintermediate- to high-luminosity giant ellipticals. The\nlatter are redder and have higher metallicity (and quite\npossibly older stellar populations) than NGC 147 and\nNGC 185. A natural explanation for the observed M/L\nof NGC 147 and NGC 185 is that these galaxies have a\nsignificant dark matter component, consistent with our\nconclusions from the comparison to population synthesis\nmodels.\n4.5. A Bound Pair?\nGiven our velocity and mass estimates, we revisit the\nquestion of whether or not NGC 147 and NGC 185 form\na gravitationally bound pair. The angular distance between NGC 147 and NGC 185 is 58\u2032 = 10 kpc. Assuming distances measured by McConnachie et al. (2005),\nNGC 147 and NGC 185 are separated by a line-of-sight\ndistance of 59 kpc, and thus a total physical separation\nof r = 60 kpc. For two point masses to be gravitationally\nbound, their potential energy must exceed the kinetic\nenergy of the system (Davis et al. 1995; van den Bergh\n1998). This leads to the criterium b \u2261 (2GMsys /r\u2206v 2 ) >\n1 for a system to be bound, where Msys is the combined\nsystem mass. We measure, in \u00a7 3, a radial velocity difference between these two dEs of \u2206v = 10.7 \u00b1 1.3 km s\u22121 .\nApproximating our dE galaxies as point masses, we calculate the criteria for these two objects to be bound as\nb = 1.6 \u00b1 1.1. This criteria suggests that, in the absence\nof transverse motion, NGC 147 and NGC 185 are a grav-\n\n\fLocal Group dE Dynamics\nitationally bound pair, in agreement with van den Bergh\n(1998). However, the large error on this quantity, in addition to the likely non-zero transverse motions of these\ntwo satellites, leaves wide open the possibility that these\nare not in fact bound.\nNGC 147 and NGC 185 are satellites of M 31. Our\nequilibrium models assume that the outer kinematics of\nthese dEs are not affected by tidal interactions with M 31,\nor each other. This is not the case for the third dE in\nthe Local Group, NGC 205, which is in the process of being tidal stripped at radii beyond 4.5\u2032 = 1 kpc by M 31.\nTo confirm our equilibrium assumption for NGC 147 and\nNGC 185, we calculate their instantaneous tidal radius in\nthe rotating frame by again approximating these galaxies\nas point sources. We assume a total mass for M 31 between 0.8\u22121.6\u00d71012M\u2299 (Klypin et al. 2002; Seigar et al.\n2008). We determine a tidal (Jacobi) radius between 10\nto 12 kpc (greater than 25 reff ) in each dE. For comparison, the tidal radius of the interacting dE NGC 205 is\n0.7 kpc. The internal kinematic profiles of NGC 147 and\nNGC 185 are unlikely to be currently affected by tidal\ninteractions with M 31, at the distances probed by the\ndata presented here. However, these calculations do not\npreclude the possibility of past tidal interactions, either\nbetween these two galaxies or with M 31, and it is yet\npossible that there are unbound stars in our kinematic\nsample. The regularity and bi-symmetry of our kinematic data for NGC 147 suggest that any contamination\nis minimal. In NGC 185, the upturn of Vrms profile over\nour models at large radius may either be interpreted as\nan increasing M/L ratio with radius, or possible tidal\ncontamination. Deeper imaging and kinematic observations are needed, particularly for NGC 185, to determine\nto what extent these dEs are affected by tidal interactions at radii beyond 8 reff .\n5. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have presented mean velocity, velocity dispersion\nand metallicity profiles for the Local Group dE galaxies\nNGC 147 and NGC 185 based on Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopic observations of 520 and 442 member RGB stars\nin each dE, respectively. The profiles represent the most\nextensive spectroscopic radial coverage for any dE galaxy,\nextending to a projected distance of eight half-light radii\n\n11\n\n(14\u2032 \u223c 8reff ). Contrary to previous results, we find that\nboth dEs have significant rotation velocities which contributes to the observed flattened shapes of each galaxy.\nOur two-integral dynamical modeling suggests that the\nobserved rotation velocities cannot fully explained the\nobserved shapes and that some anisotropic velocity dispersion is required. Our modeling estimates M/L ratios\nof M/LV = 4.2 \u00b1 0.6 and M/LV = 4.6 \u00b1 0.6 for NGC 147\nand NGC 185, respectively, which is in excess of that expected from stellar populations alone. Thus, some dark\nmatter is required to fully explain the observe kinematics.\nThe mean velocity profiles of NGC 147 and NGC 185\nsuggest that rotation may be far more prevalent in dE\ngalaxies than previously assumed. We conclude that\nthese Local Group dEs are rotationally-supported, however, if placed at the distance of the Virgo or Fornax\nClusters, integrated-light observations such as those of\nGeha et al. (2003) would have concluded that these dEs\nhave little to no rotation. It is not guaranteed that the\nLocal Group dE galaxies had similar formation mechanisms as those residing in the much denser environments\nof, e.g., the Virgo or Fornax clusters. However, this is\ncertainly plausible, given that these galaxies share similar\nfundamental plane properties, as defined by the photometric and kinematic properties inside reff (see e.g., Fig\n7). Our results then indicate that cluster dEs may also\nhave significant rotation velocities that are manifest only\nat larger radii than current observations allow. If true,\nthis significantly modifies the observational constraints\nunder which dEs can form. The observations presented\nhere open the door for formation mechanisms in which\ndEs are transformed or stripped versions of gas-rich rotating progenitor galaxies.\nWe thank S. Demers and P.
