In addition to this power\nlaw component, a second nonthermal component already detected by ASCA could be\npresent in the X-ray spectrum of the cluster, not surprisingly given the complex radio\nmorphology of the cluster central region. The spectral index of the hard tail detected\nby the PDS onboard BeppoSAX is marginally consistent with that expected by the\ninverse Compton model. A value of \u223c 0.05 \u03bcG is derived for the intracluster magnetic\nfield of the extended radio emission in the northern regions of the cluster, while a\nhigher value of \u223c 0.5 \u03bcG could be present in the central radio halo, likely related to\nthe hard tail detected by ASCA .\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\n\nSubject headings: cosmic microwave background - galaxies: clusters: individual\n(A2256) - magnetic fields - radiation mechanisms: non-thermal - X-rays: galaxies\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nNonthermal hard X-ray (HXR) radiation has been detected for the first time in the Coma\ncluster by BeppoSAX (Fusco-Femiano et al. 1999) and RXTE (Rephaeli, Gruber & Blanco 1999),\nwhile marginal evidence is reported for A2199 (Kaastra et al. 1999). These observations are only\nfirst steps towards assessing the general existence of this new component in the X-ray spectra of\nclusters of galaxies. The search for nonthermal emission in more clusters is of high importance\nas it will allow to derive additional informations on the physical conditions of the intracluster\nmedium (ICM) environment, which cannot be obtained by studying the thermal plasma emission\nonly.\nVarious interpretations of the HXR emission have been presented since its discovery in the\nComa cluster spectrum. The most direct explanation is inverse Compton (IC) scattering of\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) photons by the relativistic electrons responsible of the\nextended radio emission present in the central region of Coma (Willson 1970). The combined\nradio synchrotron and IC HXR fluxes (e.g., Rephaeli 1979) allow to estimate a volume-averaged\nintracluster magnetic field of \u223c 0.16 \u03bcG (Fusco-Femiano et al. 1999). One of the problems with\nthe IC model is that this value of the magnetic field in the ICM seems to be at odd with the\nvalue determined from Faraday rotation of polarized radiation toward the head tail radio galaxy\nNGC4869 that gives a line-of-sight B \u223c 6 \u03bcG (Feretti et al. 1995), and with the equipartition\n2/7\nvalue in the radio halo, which is \u223c 0.4 h50 \u03bcG (Giovannini et al. 1993). We note, however,\nthat Feretti et al. (1995) also inferred the existence of a weaker and larger scale magnetic field\n1/2\ncomponent in the range of 0.1 \u2212 0.2 h50 \u03bcG, and therefore the \u223c 6 \u03bcG field could be local. A low\naverage magnetic field is also consistent with the model developed by Brunetti et al. (1999), which\npredicts a magnetic field strenght decreasing with the distance from the cluster centre.\nAn alternative explanation is nonthermal bremsstrahlung (NTB) emission from suprathermal\nelectrons currently accelerated at energies greater than \u223c10 keV by shocks or turbulence (Kaastra\net al. 1998; Ensslin, Lieu, & Biermann 1999; Sarazin & Kempner 1999). Another and more trivial\npossibility is that the HXR radiation is due to a hard X-ray source present in the external regions\nof the field of view of the BeppoSAX PDS (FWHM=1.3\u25e6 , hexagonal), as for example a highly\nobscured Seyfert 2 galaxy like the Circinus galaxy (Matt et al. 1999). In the central region (\u223c 30\u2032\nin radius), the MECS image does not show evidence of this kind of sources (Fusco-Femiano 1999).\nHovewer, the detection of a hard nonthermal component in other clusters should strongly reduce\nthe probability of this last interpretation.\nIn this letter we present the results of a long observation of A2256, exploiting the unique\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\ncapabilities of the PDS, onboard BeppoSAX , to search for HXR emission (Frontera et al. 1997).\nThe cluster was also observed with the MECS, an imaging instrument working in the 1.5-10 keV\nenergy range (Boella et al. 1997). The galaxy cluster A2256 is similar to the Coma cluster in many\nX-ray properties, as luminosity and presence of substructures. The ROSAT PSPC observations\nshowed that A2256 is a double X-ray cluster (Briel et al. 1991), suggesting that a subcluster may\nbe merging with a larger cluster, although there is no strong evidence in the temperature map in\nfavour of an advanced merger (Markevitch & Vikhlinin 1997), as it is for Coma. The average gas\ntemperature is \u223c7 keV, as measured by several X-ray instruments (David et al. 1993; Hatsukade\n1989; Markevitch & Vikhlinin 1997; Henriksen 1999). Both clusters show a radio halo in the\ncentral and periferal regions. However, the radio emission from A2256 is notably complex. The\nregion around the cluster centre is occupied by an unusual concentration of radio galaxies: at\nleast five discrete sources have been identified with cluster galaxies, but there also two extended\nemission regions which have linear sizes \u22641 Mpc (Bridle & Formalont 1976; Bridle et al. 1979;\nRottgering et al. 1994).\nThroughout the Letter we assume a Hubble constant of Ho = 50 km s\u22121 M pc\u22121 h50 and\nq0 = 1/2, so that an angular distance of 1\u2032 corresponds to 92 kpc (zA2256 = 0.0581; Struble &\nRood 1991). Quoted confidence intervals are at 90% level, if not otherwise specified.\n\n2.\n\nPDS and MECS Data Reduction\n\nThe total effective exposure time was \u223c 1.3 \u00d7 105 sec for the MECS and \u223c 7.1 \u00d7 104 sec for\nthe PDS in the two observations of February 1998 and February 1999. The observed count rate for\nA2256 was 0.497\u00b10.002 cts/s for the 2 MECS units and 0.27\u00b10.04 cts/s for the PDS instrument.\nSince the source is rather faint in the PDS band (approximately 1.5 mCrab in 15-150 keV)\na careful check of the background subtraction must be performed. The background sampling was\nperformed using the default rocking law of the two PDS collimators that samples ON, +OFF,\nON, -OFF fields for each collimator with a dwell time of 96\" (Frontera et al. 1997). When one\ncollimator is pointing ON source, the other collimator is pointing toward one of the two OFF\npositions. We used the standard procedure to obtain PDS spectra (Dal Fiume et al. 1997), which\nconsists in extracting one accumulated spectrum for each unit for each collimator position. We\nthen checked the two independently accumulated background spectra in the two different +/-OFF\nsky directions, offset by 210' with respect to the on-axis pointing direction. The comparison\nbetween the two accumulated backgrounds ([+OFF] - [-OFF]) shows a difference with a marginal\nexcess below 30 keV in the [+OFF] pointing. This excess is much lower than the signal from the\nsource, but it must not be neglected. The total excess in the first two equalized energy channels\n(15-33.5 keV) is 0.048 \u00b1 0.024 cts s\u22121 , i.e. approximately 2\u03c3. This concentration in only the lowest\nenergy channels implies that the excess is likely due to contamination by a point source rather\nthan to a statistical fluctuation. The total source spectrum was therefore obtained using only the\nuncontaminated background accumulated pointing at the [-OFF] field. Hovewer, in Section 3 we\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nreport the confidence level of the nonthermal emission in excess of the thermal one considering\nthe average of the two background measurements. The background level of the PDS is the lowest\nobtained thus far with high-energy instruments on board satellites thanks to the equatorial orbit\nand is very stable again thanks to the favorable orbit. No modeling of the time variation of the\nbackground is required.\nMECS data preparation and linearization was performed using the Saxdas package under\nFtools environment. We have extracted a MECS spectrum from a circular region of 8\u2032 radius\n(corresponding to about 0.8 Mpc) centered on the primary emission peak. From the ROSAT\nPSPC radial profile, we estimate that about 70% of the total cluster emission falls within this\nradius. The background subtraction has been performed using spectra extracted from blank sky\nevent files in the same region of the detector as the source.\nA numerical relative normalization factor among the two instruments has been included in the\nfitting procedure (see next Section) to account for: a) the fact that the MECS spectrum includes\nemission out to \u223c0.8 Mpc from the X-ray peak, while the PDS field of view (1.3 degrees FWHM)\ncovers the entire emission from the cluster; b) the slight mismatch in the absolute flux calibration\nof the MECS and PDS response matrices employed (September 1997 release; Fiore, Guainazzi\n& Grandi 1999); c) the vignetting in the PDS instrument, (the MECS vignetting is included in\nthe response matrix). The estimated normalization factor is \u223c1.1. In the fitting procedure we\nallow this factor to vary within 15% from the above value to account for the uncertainty in this\nparameter.\n\n3.\n\nPDS and MECS Data Analysis and Results\n\nThe spectral analysis of the MECS data alone, in the energy range 2-9.7 keV and in the central\n\u223c0.8 Mpc region, gives a gas temperature of kT = 7.41 \u00b1 0.23 keV (\u03c72 =154.5 for 162 degrees of\nfreedom; hereafter dof), using an optically thin thermal emission model (MEKAL code on the\nXSPEC package), absorbed by a galactic line of sight equivalent hydrogen column density, NH , of\n4.01\u00d71020 cm\u22122 . This value of the temperature is consistent with the ASCA GIS measurement\n(6.78-7.44 keV; Henriksen 1999), and with the values obtained by previous observations : the\nEinstein MPC (6.7-8.1 keV; David et al. 1993) and Ginga (7.32-7.70 keV; Hatsukade 1989). Also\nthe flux of \u223c 5.3 \u00d7 10\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 in the 2-10 keV energy range is consistent with the\nprevious measurements. The iron abundance is 0.26 \u00b1 0.03, in agreement with the ASCA results\n(Markevitch & Vikhlinin 1997).\nThe analysis of the PDS data with a thermal bresstrahlung component gives a temperature\nof \u223c30 keV. Fitting the data with two thermal components, one of these at the fixed temperature\nof 7.4 keV, we obtain a temperature greater than \u223c90 keV for the second component. These\nunrealistic high values for the gas temperature obtained in both the fits are interpreted as a strong\nindication that the detected hard excess is due to a nonthermal mechanism.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nFigure 1 shows the simultaneous fit to the MECS and PDS data with a thermal component\nat the temperature of 7.47\u00b10.35 keV and a normalization factor of \u223c1.2 for the two data sets.\nThe \u03c72 is 180.5 for 167 dof. Hard X-ray radiation at energies greater than \u223c20 keV is in excess\nwith respect to the thermal component at a level of \u223c 4.6\u03c3 and this value is rather stable against\nvariation of the normalization factor. It results slightly lower (\u223c 4.5\u03c3) considering the average\nof the two background measurements. Besides, also fitting the PDS data alone with a thermal\ncomponent at the fixed temperature of 7.47 keV we obtain an excess at a level of 4.3\u03c3. If we\nintroduce a second nonthermal component, modeled as a power law, we obtain the fit shown in\nfigure 2. The \u03c72 is 156.6 for 165 dof. The improvement with respect to the previous model is\nsignificant at more than the 99.99% confidence level, according to the F-test. The confidence\ncontours of the parameters kT and photon spectral index (\u03b1X ) show that, at 90% confidence level,\nthe temperature is well determined, 6.8-7.5 keV, while \u03b1X describes a large interval 0.3-1.7. The\npresence of the nonthermal component has the effect to slightly decrease the best fit value of the\ntemperature (6.95+0.45\n\u22120.35 keV), with respect to the temperature obtained considering only the MECS\ndata. The flux of the nonthermal component is rather stable, \u223c 1.2 \u00d7 10\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 in the\n20-80 keV energy range, against variations of \u03b1X . The contribution of the nonthermal component\nto the thermal flux in the 2-10 keV energy range is \u2264 10% for \u03b1X \u22641.70. The analysis of the two\nobservations with effective exposure times of \u223c23 ksec (February 1998) and \u223c48 ksec (February\n1999) for the PDS does not show significant flux variations. These results and the fact that\nthe two clusters with a detected hard X\u2013rays excess (Coma and A2256) both have radio halos,\nstrongly support the diffuse nonthermal mechanism as responsible for the excess, as discussed in\nthe next section.\n\n4.\n\nDiscussion\n\nA2256 is the second cluster, after Coma (Fusco-Femiano et al. 1999), which shows hard X-ray\nradiation up to \u223c80 keV in the PDS spectrum, with a clear excess above the thermal intracluster\nemission. (A2199 shows only a marginal evidence in the external region of the MECS detectors,\nKaastra et al. 1999). We have investigated the possibility that the observed excess in A2256 could\nbe due by a confusing source in the field of view of the PDS. The most qualified candidate is the\nQSO 4C +79.16 observed by ROSAT PSPC with a count rate of \u223c0.041 c/s (WGA Catalogue).\nWith a typical photon index of 1.8 (ROSAT reports a steeper index of \u223c2.5), about 1.2 c/s are\nnecessary to account for the observed HXR emission of \u223c 1.2 \u00d7 10\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 in the 20-80\nkeV energy range of the PDS. Considering that the QSO is \u223c 52\u2032 off-axis, an unusual variability\nof about two orders of magnitude is required. There is still the possibility that an obscured\nsource, like Circinus (Matt et al. 1999), be responsible of the detected HXR radiation. Unless the\nobscured source is within 2\u2032 of the central bright core of A2256, our analysis of the MECS image\nexcludes the presence of this kind of sources in the central region (\u223c 30\u2032 in radius) of the cluster.\nThe application of the inverse Compton model, based on the scattering of relativistic electrons\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nwith the 3K background photons, appears less straightforward in A2256 than in the Coma\ncluster. The radio morphology is remarkably complex (Bridle & Fomalont 1976; Bridle et al. 1979;\nRottgering et al. 1994). There are at least four radio sources classified as head-tail radio galaxies,\nan ultra steep spectrum source and a diffuse region in the north with two diffuse arcs (G,H\naccording to Bridle et al. 1979), at a distance of \u223c 8\u2032 from the cluster centre. The extent of this\ndiffuse region is estimated to be 1.0\u00d70.3 Mpc, with a total flux density of 671 mJy at 610 MHz and\na rather uniform spectral index of 0.8\u00b10.1 between 610 and 1415 MHz (Bridle et al. 1979). The\npercentage polarization is uniform with an average value of 20%. The alignement of the electric\nfield vectors suggests a well ordered magnetic field. The equipartition magnetic field is 1-2 \u03bcG\n(Bridle et al. 1979). A fainter extended emission permeates the cluster centre (diffuse emission\naround D in Bridle et al. 1979) with a steeper radio spectral index of \u223c1.8 as estimated by Bridle\net al. (1979) and in agreement with the 327 MHz data from the Westerbork Northern Sky Survey\n(Rengelink et al. 1997). The total flux density is 100 mJy at 610 MHz and no polarized emission\nhave been detected from this region. We note that the physical and morphological properties of\nthe diffuse D emission are consistent with those of central halo sources while those in the G \u2212 H\nregion are consistent with the properties of peripheral relic sources as 1253+275 in the Coma\ncluster.\nIn addition to the thermal emission, a second component in the X-ray spectrum of A2256 was\nnoted by Markevitch & Vikhlinin (1997) in their spectral analysis of the ASCA data in the central\nr=3\u2032 spherical bin. Although they were not able to firmly establish the origin of this emission,\ntheir best fit is a power law model with photon index 2.4\u00b10.3, therefore favouring a nonthermal\ncomponent. The contribution of this component to the total flux is not reported in the paper.\nConsidering that there are no bright point sources in the ROSAT HRI image, they argued for an\nextended source. Also the joint ASCA GIS & RXTE PCA data analysis is consistent with the\ndetection of a nonthermal component in addition to the thermal component. The contribution of\nthis nonthermal component to the total X-ray flux in the 2-10 energy range is \u2264 4%. However,\na second thermal component (0.75-1.46 keV), instead of a nonthermal one, provides a better\ndescription of the data (Henriksen 1999). The MECS data do not show evidence of this steep\nnonthermal component in the central bin of 2\u2032 because the energy range is truncated to a lower\nlimit of 2 keV (Molendi, De Grandi, & Fusco-Femiano 2000), while a joint fit to the LECS &\nMECS data within 4\u2032 does not show a significant evidence for an additional component at energies\nlower than 2 keV.\nThe power-law component (slope 2.4 \u00b1 0.3) found in the analysis of the ASCA data\n(Markevitch & Vikhlinin 1997), and the upper limit of 1.7 for aX , determined by BeppoSAX data,\nsuggest that two tails could be present in the X-ray spectrum of A2256. The former might due to\nthe central diffuse radio source with the steep index \u03b1R \u223c1.8, and the last to the more extended\nradio emission in the northern region of the cluster with the flatter energy spectral index of\n0.8\u00b10.1. Assuming that the contribution of the power-law component, detected by ASCA , to\nthe total X-ray flux (FX (2 \u2212 10keV ) \u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 ) is \u223c 5%, we obtain a negligible\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\ncontribution at PDS energies (\u223c 4 \u00d7 10\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 ) and a magnetic field in the central\nradio region of \u223c 0.5 \u03bcG. For the external radio region, with spectral index 0.8, the nonthermal\nX-ray flux fX (20 \u2212 80keV ) \u2243 1.2 \u00d7 10\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , derived by the PDS excess, leads to a\nlow value of \u223c 0.05 \u03bcG. Even assuming that a large fraction (say 50%) of the HXR flux is due\nto the several point radio sources in the central region and/or to the contribution of different\nmechanisms, we obtain only a slightly greater value of \u223c 0.08 \u03bcG. The combined fit of ASCA GIS\nand RXTE PCA data (Henriksen 1999) gives an upper limit of 2.64 \u00d7 10\u221212 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 in the\n2-10 keV energy range for the nonthermal component that corresponds to a lower limit for the\nvolume-averaged intracluster magnetic field, B, of 0.36 \u03bcG (\u03b1R = 1.8). Considering that the HXR\nflux detected by the PDS is in agreement with the above value, we would obtain a value for B\nconsistent with that derived by the GIS & PCA data, but the fit to the MECS & PDS data is\nunacceptable for \u03b1X = 1 + \u03b1R = 2.8.\nThe previous scenario of a decreasing intracluster magnetic field from the cluster center\nwould be difficult to reconcile with the stronger periferal radio region and higher equipartition\nmagnetic field with respect to the central radio halo. Therefore, we could consider the possibility,\nrecently suggested by Brunetti et al. (1999), that the HXR IC spectrum may be flatter than the\nsynchrotron radio spectrum because of the acceleration and energy loss processes that produce\nan electron spectrum with different slopes. A different electron spectrum index for HXR and\nradio emissions is more likely for low magnetic fields which require higher electron energies for\nsynchrotron than for IC radiation. This could explain the better fit to the PDS data of A2256\nwith \u03b1X < 1 + \u03b1R =1.8. Besides, this model suggests an alternative interpretation of the HXR\nexcess of A2256. We can consider that a single hard tail is present in the X-ray spectrum of the\ncluster with index \u03b1X \u22641.7, as detected by the PDS. The electron spectrum responsible of this\nHXR IC emission can produce radio emission with spectral index \u03b1R > \u03b1X -1=0.7 with a resulting\nmean volume-averaged intracluster magnetic field higher than the one we derive from the classical\nIC model.\nA different mechanism which may produce HXR radiation is given by nonthermal\nbremsstrahlung. Sarazin & Kempner (1999) suggest that all or part of the HXR emission\ndetected in the Coma cluster might be NTB from suprathermal electrons formed through current\nacceleration of the thermal gas, either by shocks or turbulence in the ICM. For A2256 the MECS\n& PDS measurements determine a power-law momentum spectrum of the electrons with index\n\u2264 2\u03b1X \u2212 1 = 2.4 (90%). The consequence is that an accelerating electron model with flat spectrum\nproduce more IC HXR emission than the NTB mechanism, unless the electron spectrum cuts-off\nor steepens at high energies. Besides, these models produce more radio emission than observed if\nB is \u2265 1 \u03bcG.\nWe thank P. Giommi for useful suggestions regarding data analysis, G.
