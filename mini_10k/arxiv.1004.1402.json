Precise observations [1, 2] indicate that the\ncurrent epoch of the acceleration of universe is driven by a very mild (in Planck units) negative pressure, positive energy density constituent - \"dark energy\". Likewise there is strong\nevidence that the Big Bang phase of the universe was preceded by a exponentially accelerated\n(inflation) phase [3, 4] driven by a negative pressure, positive energy fluid. In most cosmological models this inflationary stage is brought about by a scalar field coupled to gravity,\nslowly \"rolling down\" an almost flat potential hill, and upon reaching the bottom of the hill\ngives rise to the big-bang stage. In most such models inflation is inevitably \"future eternal\"\ni.e. there are always some residual regions which keep on rapidly inflating. The steady state\npicture that emerges is a fractal multiverse structure with many \"pocket universes\" causally\nseparated by continually inflating sterile regions. These \"pocket universes\" might possess all\npossible different \"fundamental constants\" of nature (including a cosmological constant). So\nin this scenario one now talks about \"environmental constants\" of nature instead.\n(Super)string theory is the currently leading candidate for an unified theory of fundamental interactions and should be compatible with realistic cosmology if it has to be anything\nmore than an attractive toy model. It is great news that string theory appears to have an\nenormous \"landscape\" of vacua including many long-lived metastable states with positive\ncosmological constants [5] forming a quasi-continuum [6\u20139] which are highly relevant for\nrealistic cosmology. These metastable phases ultimately decay to neighboring stable antide Sitter phases via \"rolling down the hill\" and quantum mechanical tunneling and this is\nexactly what one needs to attempt a fundamental physics model of the (inflationary) multiverse. So it is important to develop tools in the fundamental theory which describe such\ntransitions.\nThe AdS/CFT formulation of String theory [10] is a potentially nonperturbative definition\nof superstring theory in asymptotically AdS spaces and is an perfect setting to embed the\nstring theory landscape. The neighborhood of the landscape that we study is summarized\nin figure 1.\nThe first step within this approach was taken in [11] which looked at classical AdSReissner-Nordstrom/dS domain wall type geometries (an inflating dS bubble interior patched\n2\n\n\fV(\u03c6)\n\nslow roll\n\ntunnel\ndS minima\n\nbig crunch\n\n\u03c6\nAdS minima\n\nFigure 1: The potential landscape showing the dS metastable and AdS stable vacua. The arrows\nindicate the time evolution of a possible worldline.\n\nto an asymptotic AdS black hole spacetime) in the thin wall approximation. Classical bubble\nspacetimes without charge were further investigated in [12] and subsequently in [13]. The\nlatter has an added attractive feature that the mysterious Gibbons-Hawking entropy of\nde Sitter space could be identified as a (logarithm of) subspace of black hole microstates.\nThe aim of the present paper is to build on the work of [13] by attempting to identify the\nCFT states which code these inflating states in a thermal ensemble, and further explore the\nconsequences of this scenario.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we review the semiclassical consistency\ncondition of [13] which arises from interpreting de Sitter entropy within a unitary framework for quantum gravity. This amounts to the condition that the number of states available\nmust be bounded below by the Gibbons-Hawking entropy if states corresponding to a truly\nsemiclassical region of de Sitter space exist. . Then in section 3, we review the classical\nbubble spacetimes. Keeping in mind the dual CFT as the underlying quantum description\nwe are forced to rule out the whole class of time-symmetric bubble solutions based on the\nconsistency condition. In particular, this rules out tunneling solutions of the type described\nin [14]. In section 4, we focus on the CFT picture of the time-asymmetric solutions compatible with the aforementioned consistency condition and their signatures in the dual CFT.\nWe model the effect of the radiation reflecting off the shell by reducing the problem to that\n3\n\n\fof a moving mirror in a black hole background. In section 5 we discuss consistency checks\nof such a scenario. In section 6 we draw various conclusions regarding the implications for\nsuch a picture for cosmology and how several problems/paradoxes that plague the eternal\ninflation scenario - namely the measure problem, the youngness paradox and the Boltzmann\nbrains paradox are overcome in this setting.\n\nII.\n\nQUANTUM DE SITTER STATE\n\nIn [13] it had been advocated that the Gibbons-Hawking entropy of dS space can be\ncorrectly interpreted as the logarithm of the dimension of quantum gravity state (Hilbert)\nspace. This proposition was based on numerical observations of the entropy of the present\nuniverse, dominated by a contribution from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons. We review this rationale briefly here once again. The entropy of CMB photons see,\nfor example, [15]) is,\nSCM B \u223c 1088\nwith wavelength, \u03bbCM B \u223c 1 mm, while the Gibbons-Hawking entropy of dS space with the\npresent day cosmological constant is,\nSGH \u223c 10123 .\nSo with a field theory cut off with about \u01eb = 1 TeV, the total number of states in effective\nfield theory associated with CMB photons is (\u03bbCM B \u01eb)3 SCM B \u223c 10138 , way too large to be\naccounted by the de Sitter entropy.\nFrom past experience with AdS/CFT we know that the notion of a cut off in the bulk\neffective field theory (EFT) is complex and in particular dependent on the respective quantum (CFT) state, unlike the conventional uniform cut off in usual effective field theories\n[16\u201319]. So an EFT in the bulk with an adaptive step size cutoff which allocates up to 1035\nstates per CMB photon would saturate the Gibbons-Hawking entropy of dS space with the\npresent day cosmological constant. Hence we are justified in saying that Gibbons-Hawking\nde Sitter entropy does count (logarithm of) the number of possible states in EFT, albeit\nwith a clever cut-off [13].\n\n4\n\n\fAdS/CFT also taught us that generic states in the quantum theory (CFT) have no nice\nbulk space time interpretation. But in addition to just a smooth space time geometry\n(metric) once also requires large families of observables to reproduce the entire span of\nsemiclassical physics on this smooth geometry. This observation coupled with the above\nnumerical bound on the entropy of the universe leads us to the following hypothesis for the\nde Sitter state in a quantum theory of gravity:\n\u2022 Semiclassical Consistency Hypothesis (SCH): The set of microstates representing a semiclassical de Sitter region must number at least eSGH .\n\nIII.\n\nINFLATION IN AdS/CFT: dS/SAdS DOMAIN WALLS\n\nLet us briefly review the geometric set up which can be found in great detail in [11,\n12, 20]. We have a domain wall geometry by patching together a (interior) dS-region with\ncosmological constant (c.c.) \u039bdS =\nc.c set to \u039bAdS =\n\n3\n2\nlAdS\n\n3\n2\nldS\n\nand an (exterior) AdS-Schwarzschild geometry with\n\nand hole mass M across a thin spherical shell (parametrized r = R(\u03c4 )\n\nwhere \u03c4 is the proper time of the shell. The world volume metric of the shell is then given\nby the equation,\nds2 = \u2212d\u03c4 2 + R(\u03c4 2 )d\u03a92 .\nThe geometry is specified by the following metric and the coordinate ranges,\n\n2\n\nds =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\u2212fdS (r)dt2 +\ndS\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\u2212fSAdS (r)dt2\n\ndr 2\nfdS (r)\n\nSAdS\n\n+\n\n+ r 2 d\u03a92 ,\n\ndr 2\nfSAdS (r)\n\nfdS (r) = 1 \u2212\n\nr2\n2 ,\nldS\n\n+ r 2 d\u03a92 , fSAdS (r) = 1 \u2212\n\n2GM\nr\n\nr < R(\u03c4 ) (inside)\n+\n\nr2\n,\n2\nlAdS\n\nr > R(\u03c4 ) (outside) .\n\nHere r is a global coordinate and the times inside and outside the bubble are related by\nequating the invariant distance along the shell from inside and outside.\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\ndr 2\ndr 2\n2\n2\n2\n= \u2212d\u03c4 = \u2212fSAdS (r)dtSAdS +\n.\n\u2212fdS (r)dtdS +\nfdS (r) r=R(\u03c4 )\nfSAdS (r) r=R(\u03c4 )\n\n(1)\n\nThe consistent junction conditions relate the discontinuity of the extrinsic curvature across\nthe shell to the stress energy tensor of the shell (defining \u03ba = 4\u03c0G\u03c3, with \u03c3 the surface\nenergy density of the shell),\n5\n\n\fq\nq\n2\n\u1e58 + fSAdS (r) \u2212 \u1e582 + fdS (r) = \u03baR\n\nwhich determine the shell trajectory (substituting r = R(\u03c4 )) can be rewritten\n\u1e59 2 + Vef f (r) = 0\n\n(2)\n\nso the trajectory is that of a zero net energy particle moving in potential,\n\nVef f (r) = \u2212\n\n\u0010\n\n1\n2\nldS\n\n+ \u03ba2 \u2212\n\n1\n2\nlAdS\n\n4\u03ba2\n\n\u00112\n\n+\n\n4\n2 l2\nldS\nAdS\n\nr2 + 1 +\n\nGM\n\n\u0010\n\n1\n2\nldS\n\n+\n\n1\n2\nlAdS\n\n\u03ba2\n\n\u0011\n\u2212 \u03ba2 1 G2 M 2\n\u2212 2 4\nr\n\u03ba r\n\n(3)\n\nin one space dimension. The solutions can be broadly classified into two categories - one\nwhen the parameters are such that the potential has a maximum that is positive and when\nit is negative. In the first case the zero energy particle is reflected off the barrier and the\nbubble traces out a time symmetric trajectory, in some choice of coordinates, while in the\nsecond case the particle rolls over to the top of the potential hill to the other side and the\nbubble traces out a time asymmetric trajectory , figure 2.\nAs shown in [12] for all the time symmetric cases:\nrbh < rdS\ni.e. the black hole horizon radius is less than the de Sitter horizon length and this implies,\nSGH > SBH ,\nwith SBH the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the black hole.\nNow let us consider a black hole such that rbh > lAdS so that the black hole is welldescribed by the canonical ensemble in the CFT. The available microstates, eSBH , must\nexceed the microstates of the internal dS bubble, eSGH , according to the SCH. There are\nsimply not enough microstates in the dual CFT to constitute the whole range of semiclassical\nphenomena in the interior of the bulk dS bubble. So the SCH rules out all such time\nsymmetric bubble configurations in the quantum picture. In particular no such false vacuum\ndS bubbles can be formed by quantum mechanical tunneling from AdS spacetime. Thus\nwe see in the AdS/CFT framework, the type of tunneling events considered in [14, 21]\ndo not occur. Once any kind of local tunneling process allows arbitrarily large regions of\n6\n\n\fFigure 2: A Time symmetric bubble trajectory: The left diagram is dS spacetime and the right\ndiagram is SAdS spacetime.

In the bubble interior, any worldline eventually tunnels back into the\nstable AdS vacuum, but the tunneling portion of the bubble undergoes a big crunch [22].\n\nIV.\nA.\n\nTHE CFT PICTURE\nSchwarzschild anti-de Sitter black hole\n\nThe basic setup we consider is shown in figure 5. A large black hole is formed from\nthe collapse of a null shell sent in from infinity into empty AdS4 spacetime. This process\nis expected to be described by a pure state within a single conformal field theory. Under\ntime evolution, the state is thermalized, and late-time correlation functions will be wellapproximated by those in the canonical ensemble, at temperature corresponding to the\nHawking temperature of the black hole, or alternatively in the microcanonical ensemble at\nfixed energy.\nThe conformal field theory is unitary and can be viewed as living on the left conformal\n8\n\n\fFigure 4: Penrose diagrams after taking into account perturbations. The left diagram shows the\nbubble trajectory in dS spacetime. The region to the right of the bubble wall is excised. Eventually\nany given worldline tunnels back into an AdS region, leading to a big crunch. The diagram on the\nright shows the trajectory through AdS spacetime. The region to the left of the wall is excised.\nPerturbations lead to a Cauchy horizon with a null singularity meeting the bubble wall at infinity.\n\nboundary R \u00d7 S2 . Since the spatial directions are compact the CFT entropy in these statistical ensembles will be finite and given by the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the black hole\nSBH . For timescales of order the Poincare recurrence time eSBH , the correlators will deviate\nwildly from the thermal correlators [23\u201328], but ultimately will settle down again to quasithermal correlators. This is represented in figure 5 by singularities separating well-behaved\nsemiclassical regions with a SAdS black hole exterior.\nNote that some of these regions apparently have two disconnected boundary regions at\ninfinity [29] (such as the second region from the top in figure 5). However, in line with the\nsetup in the previous paragraphs, these asymptotic regions are not to be viewed as completely\nindependent of each other, but rather as representing analytic continuation of modes with\nfinite energy from a single exterior region, dual to states in a single CFT. Ultimately these\nbulk geometries are approximate descriptions of the time evolution of a pure state in a single\nCFT.\nIn general states emerging from the white hole singularities in figure 5 will contain all\nexcitations present in the thermal ensemble. In particular, the bubble solutions of section\nIII will appear with nonvanishing probability. Since the Poincare recurrences go on forever,\nwe have an infinite number of times to produce bubbles with realistic cosmological interiors,\n\n9\n\n\fincluding inflation, while at any given time only a finite number of CFT states need be\nconsidered. These transitions populate the string theory landscape in a timelike manner\ninstead of a spacelike manner as in standard eternal inflation [30\u201337]. We refer to this\nscenario as punctuated eternal inflation. As we will see, many of the attractive features of\neternal inflation survive in this picture, while at the same time, problems of the cosmological\nmeasure and many other issues are ameliorated.\n\nB.\n\nBubble states in the CFT\n\nIt is helpful to begin by first considering modes of a scalar field with finite global energy,\nand the relevant vacuum state. Let us review Unruh's construction [38] adapted to the\neternal SAdS geometry. The geometry includes two asymptotic regions related via analytic\ncontinuation. Any finite frequency Kruskal modes can be continued analytically across the\nhorizon and used to provide a complete basis in the full SAdS manifold. Likewise, Rindler\nmodes can be patched together to define global modes. For the Rindler modes, positive\nfrequencies are defined with respect to asymptotic timelike killing vectors, and positive\nfrequency for global modes is defined with respect to the null killing vector at the horizon\nwhen the metric is written in Kruskal-like coordinate[38].\nThe two types of vacuum state are related by\n\n|0iKruskal =\n\nY\n\u03c9\n\nexp(e\u22124\u03c0GM \u03c9 b\u20201\u03c9 b\u20202\u03c9 )|0i1 \u00d7 |0i2\n\nwhere 1, 2 indicate the left/right asymptotic regions of SAdS and b1/2 (b\u20201/2 ) are the respective\nRindler annihilation (creation) operators. The Kruskal annihilation operator can expressed\nin terms of the creation and annihilation operators on the left and right regions as follows,\na\u2020Kruskal\n= b\u20201\u03c9 + e\u22124\u03c0GM \u03c9 b2\u03c9 .\n\u03c9\n\n(4)\n\nThus we see that a finite energy mode well-localized in one asymptotic region will necessarily\nhave an exponentially suppressed component in the other asymptotic region. These finite\nfrequency bulk modes may then be mapped to operators in the conformal field theory via the\nstandard bulk to boundary map of [39, 40], generalized to the eternal black hole background.\nNow we have so far made the convenient approximation that the bubble wall is thin. The\n10\n\n\fFigure 5: Punctuated Eternal Inflation: Starting with empty AdS space, dual to the vacuum state\nof the CFT, a light-like shell, shown by the blue line, collapses into a black hole. A bubble with dS\ninterior, shown by the red curve, appears out of the spacelike singularity. The left side of the red\nline i.e. the bubble wall is a piece of dS space. This sequence repeats, following the quasiperiodic\nPoincare recurrences in the dual gauge theory.\n\n11\n\n\fRegion +\n\nRegion I\n\nRegion II\n\nRegion \u2212\n\nFigure 6: The two asymptotic regions of SAdS\n\nFigure 7: Radiation coming off the bubble walls\n\nessential details of the construction are not expected to change if we generalize to consider\nwalls of finite thickness, that might be built from finite frequency modes. Moreover, we\nexpect operators creating and annihilating bubbles to obey a similar equation to (4). This\nis good news for representing such operators in the CFT, since they may be reconstructed\nusing the positive and negative frequency modes in only the right asymptotic region, which\nmay then be mapped into the CFT. In addition to this leading order effect, further details\nof the bubble state can be extracted from the radiation coming off the bubble wall to the\nleft asymptotic region (depicted by the red dashed arrows in the figure 7).\nTo study the effects of the radiation coming off the bubble we model the bubble wall as a\nperfect mirror i.e. impose purely reflecting boundary conditions for the (scalar) field propa-\n\n12\n\n\fgating in the SAdS background and restrict ourselves spherical symmetry. The computation\nis sketched in Appendix B. Further specification of the bubble would require the particular\ndetails of the metastable string theory vacuum giving rise to the potential shown in figure\n1. Nevertheless, for a given potential and choice of initial state in the gravity dual, one has\na well-defined (one-to-many) mapping into the CFT.\nAt this point let us collect a few facts on the spectrum of bubble states, which will be\nuseful in the subsequent sections. One could compute frequencies of normalizable excitations\naround the bubble geometry by solving the gravity equations of motion. However this\nspectrum is expected to receive important corrections due to back-reaction and quantum\neffects. The CFT enables us to take these effects into account. Even without all the details\nof the CFT dual that incorporates a bulk potential of the form figure 1, some qualitative\nfeatures of the spectrum can be determined. The domain wall states considered in the\npresent scenario are viewed as a subset of black hole microstates. These are dual to states\nin the CFT3 on the spacetime R \u00d7 S2 , therefore the entire spectrum of CFT states will be\ndiscrete. We can schematically write the microcanonical density matrix to be,\n\n\u03c1(E) =\n\nX\n\na,b,...\n\nwhere\n\n|\u03c8a,b,.... ih\u03c8a,b,...|\n\nH|\u03c8a,b,....i = E|\u03c8a,b,.... i\nare energy eigenstates with discrete internal labels a, b, .... . For large total energy E this\ncan be well-approximated by the density matrix of the canonical ensemble\n\n\u03c1(\u03b2) =\n\nX\n\ne\u2212\u03b2 H |\u03c8a,b,*** ih\u03c8a,b,***|\n\nwhere \u03b2 is the black hole inverse temperature. This may then be directly mapped into the\ncanonical ensemble in the CFT at inverse temperature \u03b2. This will be our basic working\ndefinition of the ensemble of states that contains inflating bubbles of the type shown in figure\n7. As we will see, this is already sufficient to provide interesting bounds on the measures of\ncosmological interest.\nOf course the canonical ensemble also contains many states that do not represent cosmological solutions of interest. One could construct a more refined ensemble by selecting\non black holes with expanding interiors. Local bulk correlators can be constructed in these\n13\n\n\fspacetimes (including points inside the bubble) by generalizing the two-dimensional construction of [19]. Correlators of massless fields will exhibit a characteristic powerlaw falloff\nwith geodesic separation inside the bubble, and this geodesic separation depends directly on\nthe vacuum energy inside the bubble. Using the methods of [16\u201318] these correlators may\nbe mapped into integral transforms of correlators in the CFT. This yields a straightforward,\nthough calculationally tedious way of selecting the vacuum energy inside the bubbles.\nAnother, more direct way, to select on expanding bubble states is to use characteristic\nradiation coming off the bubble (as shown in figure 7) to refine the specification of the CFT\nstate. As mentioned above, this is explored in a simplified model in appendix B. On the\ngravity side the solution is that of a black hole with a set of quasinormal modes excited. The\namplitudes for these modes will be determined by the bubble initial state, and the detailed\nproperties of the potential of figure 1. This can be represented by a time-dependent density\nmatrix in the CFT, that will, in general, depend on the vacuum energy inside the bubble.\n\nV.\n\nCONSISTENCY CHECKS\n\nThe semiclassical consistency hypothesis of section II by construction produces quantum\nversions of de Sitter space with a sensible semiclassical limit as ~ \u2192 0 and SGH \u2192 \u221e. In\nthis section we perform some consistency checks on the approach to the semiclassical limit,\nwith a view to keeping SGB , SBH and ~ finite to use as a physically sensible regulator for\neternal inflation. The detailed scenario we have in mind for the remainder of the paper is\nshown in figure 1, where a worldline begins in a rapidly inflating phase, that later settles\ninto a metastable de Sitter vacuum, that will be modeled as the late-time development of\nbubbles solutions such as those shown in figure 7.\nWe begin by studying the late-time history of this worldline. From the original work\n[22, 41] we know that a worldline in the dS bubble tunnels back to the stable AdS vacuum.\nThis event is accompanied by extra excitation energy that quickly leads to a big crunch.\nRelated tunneling solutions within the AdS/CFT context have recently been studied in [42].\nFrom an estimate of the tunneling rate we can we know how long this worldline lasts in\nproper time. This time is (see, for example [5] )\n\u03c4decay \u223c eS(\u03c6) eSGH ,\n14\n\n(5)\n\n\fwhere S(\u03c6) < 0, |S(\u03c6)| \u226b 1 and is just the O(4) invariant Euclidean action for the tunneling\ntrajectory from dS to AdS space. This may be converted into a timescale in the CFT by\nmapping to Schwarzschild time in the exterior AdS region. This calculation is performed in\nappendix A, eqn. (A2).\n\ntdecay,SAdS \u2248 B \u2212\n\n2\nAlAdS\ncS\ne\u2212e GH , 0 < c < 1\nldS\n\nwhere A, B are constants defined in appendix (A). Thus the decay time is typically shorter\nthan a Planck time in SAdS coordinates, from the moment when the bubble wall reaches\nthe null singularity in the exterior region, as shown in figure (4). For such short timescales\nwe should not trust the semiclassical gravity description, though the CFT description is\nvalid. We therefore conclude that this tunneling process happens long after conventional\nsemiclassical physics has broken down in the dS bubble.\nThe Poincare recurrence time for de Sitter space \u03c4P oincare, dS \u223c eSGH is already much\nlonger than the tunneling timescale (5). This eliminates all the issues one encounters when\nthe decay time exceeds the recurrence time, for instance breakdown of a classical general\nrelativity by reversal of the arrow of time in a semiclassical regime as discussed in [43].\nThe finest time resolution we can reasonably hope to resolve in the bulk is\n\u2206tSAdS = lpl\nthe Planck time. Translating this back into de Sitter proper time (as shown in appendix A)\nwe obtain\n\u03c4dS = ldS log\n\n\u0012\n\n2\nAlAdS\nlpl ldS\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(6)\n\nAs we will later see, this timescale will typically be ldS 10d where d is some number of order 1.\nThus we see that in this scenario our semiclassical de Sitter bubble survives for a far shorter\nthan one might have imagined based on tunneling probabilities, before the discreteness of\nthe CFT makes its presence felt. Nevertheless, as we will see, for reasonable parameter\nchoices, our present cosmological history can be embedded in this scenario.\nNow let us address the question of whether for times smaller than (6) the CFT can\naccurately reproduce correlators inside the dS bubble. This issue arises in studies of the black\nhole information problem, where the CFT must encode the details of the internal state of\nthe black hole. As shown in [44, 45], for effective field theory in black hole backgrounds, the\n15\n\n\fdeparture from locality on observations made over times less than the scale in Schwarzschild\ncoordinates \u2206tSAdS \u223c SBH \u03b2H is less than the scale e\u2212SBH (for example the amplitude of\nHawking emission) following information theoretic arguments first invoked in [46]. Recall\nthat the AdS5 /CFT4 map implies SBH \u221d N 2 and hence e\u2212SBH \u223c\n\n1\neN 2\n\nrepresents effects which\n\nare non-perturbative in 1/N in the dual gauge theory. For the d = 3 case the dual CFT is\nexpected to be a generalization of the CFT studied in [47]. There the CFT was realized as a\nChern-Simons theory with Chern-Simons level number k playing the role of gauge coupling,\ngY2 M .\nThe observer in the dS bubble will only be able to measure, for example, energy with an\nintrinsic error of 1/ldS given the above discussion. This is already a much larger error than\nthe error potentially allowed from a construction of bulk amplitudes from the exact CFT.\nTherefore we conclude there are no immediate obstructions to reproducing semiclassical\nphysics inside the bubble from the exact CFT description, for proper times less than (6).\n\nVI.\n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR COSMOLOGY\n\nIn this section we examine a number of standard issues in cosmology within this scenario.\n\nA.\n\nBound on the number of e-foldings of inflation\n\nSuppose we make a bubble with \u039bdS = \u039btoday \u223c (10\u22123 eV )4 and say it developed from a\n\nGUT scale bubble excitation \u039bGU T = (1016 GeV )4 following the time evolution sketched in\nfigure (1). Let us denote the maximum number of e-foldings in the high-scale phase by nmax .\n\nIf we use the Gibbons-Hawking entropy to count states in the different de Sitter phases, then\nbalancing the entropy before and after high-scale inflation, we have\nNo. of Hubble volumes \u00d7 SGU T \u2264 Stoday\nnmax \u2264\n\n\u039bGU T\n1\nlog\n3\n\u039btoday\n\nnmax \u2264 86.\n\n(7)\n\nSo we see the present scenario reproduces the bound on the number of efolds derived in [48].\nThese kinds of bounds are discussed further in [49].\n\n16\n\n\fThe logic presented here is rather different to that of [48]. Here we match the number\nof available microstates within the ensemble of states that evolves toward a single large\n\u039btoday bubble to derive the bound. In [48] they instead consider the entropy of a fluid in de\nSitter and match the entropy of the stiffest fluid, that of a gas of black holes, in order to\nreach the bound (7). Nevertheless it is satisfying the bound of [48] is reproduced when de\nSitter spacetime is embedded in a complete unitary theory of quantum gravity, such as the\nAdS/CFT duality. The present scenario offers a number of modifications and refinements\nto the Cosmological Complementarity principle presented in [50].\n\nB.\n\nNatural minimization of the cosmological constant\n\nA fundamental puzzle in modern cosmology is smallness of the cosmological constant\ncompared to the scales of fundamental physics. In terms of Hubble parameters, there is a\nhuge hierarchy\nHtoday\n\u221d\nHinf lation\n\nr\n\n\u039btoday\n\u223c 1056 .\n\u039bGU T\n\nThe present scenario gives us a natural explanation for decrease of the cosmological constant.\nLet us consider the ensemble of microstates that can evolve to a single large bubble, which\nwe will refer to as the grand ensemble. For timescales smaller than (6) we treat this ensemble\nas a closed system. Semiclassical evolution of the bubble implies that it keeps growing for as\nlong as possible. The classical singularity theorems of Hawking and Penrose [51] imply the\ninitial state began at high density. As the bubble expands, the number of states is ultimately\nbounded by eSBH , the number of black hole microstates in the external AdS spacetime.\nWe model the GUT-scale phase of inflation by a similar ensemble with \u039bdS = \u039bGU T ,\nwhich we refer to as the small ensemble. With each e-folding an entire Hubble volume worth\nobservables are added to the small ensemble. We should view the GUT-scale region as\ncontained within the grand ensemble of the previous paragraph, since ultimately it evolves\ntoward it. Therefore we can apply the second law of thermodynamics to the small ensemble\nand find that the entropy (the log of the number of available microstates) increases as the\nbubble expands. This, of course, can only be consistent if \u039btoday < \u039bGU T . Extending this\nargument by relating the cosmological entropy in a background with time-dependent Hubble\n\n17\n\n\fparameter [52] to the microscopic entropy, one finds\n\u1e60 \u2265 0 \u21d2 \u1e22 \u2264 0 .\nA closely related argument has been put forward by Strominger [53] based on a c\u2212theorem\nby viewing the de Sitter regions as dual to CFTs. He proposed our universe is represented\nas a renormalization group (RG) flow between two conformal fixed points where the forward\ntime-translation in the bulk was interpreted as an IR-to-UV RG flow of a putative dual\nCFT. The Hubble parameter,\n\nH=\n\n\u0227\na\n\n(8)\n\nwas proposed to play the special role of the (inverse of) central charge of the dual CFT,\n\nc=\n\n1\nHG\n\n(9)\n\nbecause for matter obeying the null energy condition, the Einstein equation implies,\n\n\u1e22 \u2264 0 \u21d2 \u010b > 0 .\nIn the context of the present scenario, the conformal symmetry of the de Sitter phase\narises as an emergent symmetry of the subset of black hole microstates corresponding to the\nexpanding bubbles, over a restricted range of timescales. Nevertheless, because the gravity\nproblem can be understood in terms of a RG flow, it suggests that these de Sitter solutions\ndo correspond to stable (or at least quasi-stable) fixed points. It remains an open problem\nhow to better identify these fixed points more directly once embedded in the consistent\nAdS/CFT framework.\n\nC.\n\nUnitarity and eternal inflation\n\nOne of the features of the standard eternal inflation scenario is that once started, there is\nalways a region on a given spacelike slice where high-scale inflation is occurring. Essentially\nbaby universes branch off in these highly quantum regions. It is difficult to imagine how\nsuch processes can preserve unitarity in a quantum description. If the number of microscopic\ndegrees of freedom changes with time, then unitarity is necessarily violated. Certainly if\n18\n\n\fsuch branching processes occurred locally, we can invoke the results of [54] that show that\nsuch violations of unitarity would lead to Planck scale violations of energy and momentum\nconservation in the bulk.\nAside from the issue of unitarity, standard eternal inflation has the attractive feature that\nthe probability distribution of inflating regions should eventually reach a stationary state.\nThis has the potential to lead to some very interesting predictions, however as we will review\nlater, the infinite nature of the spacelike slices in this stationary state has so far stymied\nthis effort.\nAnother useful feature of eternal inflation is that it provides a natural mechanism for\npopulating the landscape of string theory vacua. There is always some region on a given\nspacelike slice in a position to roll down to one of the stable or metastable vacua of string\ntheory. This phenomena then opens the door to anthropic arguments playing a role in our\nunderstanding of the observed parameters of nature.\nIn the bubble scenario, unitary is no longer an issue, since the states are realized as states\nin a unitary conformal field theory. As we have seen, this regulates both the spacelike and\ntimelike extent of a cosmological region that may be treated semiclassically. However as far\nas we have seen, there is room to describe a large expanding universe for a large number of\nHubble times.\nAs we have seen, the semiclassical consistency hypothesis of section (II) rules out tunneling to semiclassical expanding bubbles. Because baby universes cannot form from smooth\ninitial data, the problems with bulk unitarity described in [54] are avoided. Instead expanding bubbles only emerge from punctuation points, i.e. the spacelike singularities of\nblack/white holes. Unlike standard eternal inflation, a time-independent probability distribution does not emerge.\nHowever Poincare recurrences in the CFT lead to quasi-periodic recurrence. Thus rather\nthan in the spacelike direction, we have infinite extent in the timelike direction. The randomness of the recurrences can provide a mechanism to populate whatever stable and metastable\nvacua are present, so this attractive feature of eternal inflation is preserved.\n\n19\n\n\fD.\n\nMeasure on the space of initial data\n\nNow as emphasized before we can work in a microcanonical ensemble since the spacetime\ngoes through many punctuated phases and has sufficient time to explore the entire phase\nspace. So at the fundamental level, the measure on the space of initial data should be set\nby ergodicity. In particular, all bubble states at equal energy will be equally probable. The\nprecise probability distribution will depend on the details of the spectrum of black hole\nmicrostates in the particular CFT dual to the gravity background with potential shown in\nfigure 1. However a number of general properties of these distributions can be determined\nsimply from a knowledge of the black hole entropy, which must bound the bubble entropy,\nand the interpretation of bubble entropy described in section II and in [13].\nFor single bubbles, one could approximate the probability distribution as\nPbubble (ldS ) =\n\neSGH (ldS )\u2212q(ldS ,M )\n,\neSBH (M )\n\n(10)\n\nwhere M is the fixed mass of the large AdS black hole that dominates the microcanonical\nensemble, and q(ldS , M) \u2265 0 represents a kind of form factor that parameterizes the likelihood of the black hole having such bubble solutions as microstates. Qualitatively, we expect\nlimldS \u2192lpl q(ldS , M) = 0 since the formation of small bubbles near the singularity should be a\nlocal process, independent of M. However limldS \u2192rBH q(ldS , M) \u226b 1, where rBH is the black\nhole horizon radius, reflecting the fact that no bubble states larger than the black hole are\nallowed. This means large single bubbles are more likely, with a typical size lpl < ldS < rBH .\nNow let us consider the effect of multiple bubbles. For very large bubbles, only a single\nbubble will fit inside the black hole, so the question becomes whether there is more entropy\nin a soup of small bubbles. Let us approximate the collection of small bubbles by a gas\nof particles in thermal equilibrium with the anti-de Sitter Schwarzschild black hole. The\nentropy of this gas will be bounded above by the entropy of a gas of massless particles\n(which for the sake of simplicity we can take to be conformally coupled). This one of the\nsystems studied in the work by Hawking and Page [55]. They find that for M > m2pl lAdS\nthat the black hole entropy dominates over the entropy of the massless particles. Here\nm2pl = 1/G, with mpl the Planck mass. Assuming the form factor q(ldS , M) does not fall off\nvery rapidly, the entropy of single large bubbles will therefore dominate over that of multiple\nsmall bubbles, for sufficiently large black holes. The probability distribution for different\nvalues of ldS can then be well-approximated by (10) assuming the gravity theory has access\n20\n\n\fto a full landscape of string theory vacua with many different values of ldS possible, so that\nq(ldS , M) is a smooth function.\n\nE.\n\nResolution of cosmological paradoxes\n\nIn the present scenario time development is future eternal, and at any given time the\nregion along a spacelike slice undergoing interesting cosmology (i.e. a large region in an\nexpanding phase) is of finite extent. It will be useful to count the number of potential\nobservers within a given causal diamond inside this region. To do this we compute the\nentropy per Hubble volume inside the expanding bubble as a function of time. Here we have\nin mind a bubble with an interior rolling down the potential as shown in figure 1, so for now\non we will generalize to a Robertson-Walker metric for the interior\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + a(t)2 (dr 2 + d\u03a92 ) .\nDenoting the densities by \u03c1\u03c8 , \u03c1\u03b3 and \u03c1\u039b for the densities of matter, radiation and cosmological\nconstant respectively, the Friedman equations are\n\n\u0227(t) \u2212 a(t)\n\ns\n\n2\n8\u03c0lpl\n(\u03c1\u03c8 + \u03c1\u03b3 + \u03c1\u039b ) = 0\n3\n\n\u03c1\u0307\u03c8 (t) + 3\n\n\u0227(t)\n\u03c1\u03c8 (t) = 0\na(t)\n\n\u03c1\u0307\u03b3 (t) + 4\n\n\u0227(t)\n\u03c1\u03b3 (t) = 0\na(t)\n\n\u03c1\u0307\u039b (t) = 0 .\nThe entropy density for any component is\nsi =\n\n(\u03c1i + Pi )\n(1 + wi )\u03c1i\n=\nTi\nTi\n\nwhere P = w\u03c1 is the equation of state (w = 0, 31 , \u22121 for matter, radiation and, cosmological\nconstant respectively).

This will be less than the timescale tsc when\nsemiclassical physics breaks down (6) if we have a region where gravity is a good description\ninside the bubble. Also shown on the plot is the timescale when Boltzmann brains dominates\ntBB , which will always be much larger than the timescale (6). This figure will play a key\nrole in seeing how various cosmological paradoxes are resolved.\n\n1.\n\nCosmological measure\n\nThe theory of inflation has had many successes in terms of explaining a number of observed phenomena within our Hubble volume, such as providing natural explanations of the\n22\n\n\fSH\n\ntsc\n\ntco\n\ntbb\n\nFigure 8: Entropy of matter and radiation per Hubble volume as a function of time. This provides\nan estimate of the number of potential observers as a function of time.\n\nhorizon problem, the flatness problem and the spectrum of cosmic microwave background\nperturbations. Extending the theory of inflation using semiclassical approaches to quantum\ngravity leads to eternal inflation [30\u201337], which describes a multiverse of pocket universes.\nThe goal then becomes how to ascribe probabilities to histories through this multiverse, i.e.\nthe cosmological measure problem.\nIn eternal inflation the \"pocket universes\" are infinite in number. Without any regularization, probabilities, being a ratio of two infinities, are ill-defined. Even after regularization\nthere is no guarantee that the answer could not depend on the regularization method.\nCurrent attempts to define the measure tend to be coordinate dependent and and hence\nambiguous ([56] and references therein).\nThis issue is resolved in the present scenario: a natural regulator that preserves unitarity\nis introduced. A probability measure for different cosmologies can then be extracted by\nevaluating (10) for a given conformal field theory, which computes the likelihood of expanding\nbubbles as a function of their parameters.\nAs emphasized in [57, 58] what is most relevant for observation are probabilities conditioned on the existence of observers. This can be incorporated into the discussion in the\nfollowing way. The density of observers can be expected to be proportional to the entropy\n23\n\n\fdensity of matter (and perhaps also radiation). However entropy density alone is not a good\nguide, because one could have a high density, rapidly expanding region of spacetime. In this\ncase the number of degrees of freedom in causal contact with each other can remain small,\nso complex systems, such as observers, will not form.\nTherefore we propose to count the amount of matter and radiation per Hubble volume\nas an approximate measure of the number of degrees of freedom in causal contact with each\nother. This has the advantage of being a locally defined quantity along a given worldline.\nMoreover it reduces to the volume of a causal diamond when the cosmological constant\ndominates the expansion.\nThe result is a world-line measure that determines the likelihood an given observer will\nmeasure a particular set of landscape parameters, as well as other cosmological observables.\nFor example, if we condition on the the observer being in an expanding region where semiclassical gravity operates, then we conclude from (10) and figure 8 that the most likely\nobserver will exist at time \u03c4 = \u03c4peak .\n\n2.\n\nCosmic Coincidence Problem:\n\nAnother fundamental puzzle of cosmology is why the energy density of dark energy is\ncomparable to the energy of the matter today\n\u03c1\u039b \u223c \u03c1M atter .\n\n(14)\n\nThis is resolved by the world-line measure described in the previous section. A typical\nobserver will appear near the peak of the entropy per Hubble volume, where the densities\nare related by (13).\nThis computation is similar in spirit to the argument of [59]. There they generalize Weinberg's argument [58] for the most likely cosmological constant and treat both the cosmological constant and the density contrast at the time of recombination are random variables.\nThey conclude that most galaxies form at the time of cosmological constant dominance,\nproviding an anthropic explanation of (14). The world-line measure of the previous section\nprovides a much simplified version of this computation, relying only on H(t) .\n\n24\n\n\f3.\n\nYoungness Paradox and Oldness Paradox\n\nOne of the more popular cosmological measures in standard eternal inflation assigns\nlikelihood proportional to volume of a given pocket universe. In this picture, a region\nof large vacuum energy expands very rapidly and comes to dominate the volume along a\nfamily of spacelike hypersurfaces (see for example [56]. Thus for any finite time truncation\nthe pockets with Planck scale expansion dominate in an overwhelming manner. This would\nthen make our universe which has been around for billions of years a very special old pocket\n[36].\nThe cosmological measure described in section VI E 1 also resolves this paradox. A typical\nbubble will actually be one with a very large number of states according to (10). Since this\nstate evolves from a singular state, an observer will see higher density looking toward the\npast, but such an observer will typically sit near the coincidence point (13).\n\n4.\n\nBoltzmann Brains\n\nIf the bubble were to be arbitrarily long-lived, it might happen that the area under the\ncurve in figure 8 associated with Hawking radiation could dominate, versus the area under\nthe matter/radiation peak. This leads to a potential oldness paradox in the present scenario,\nwhich is often referred to as the Boltzmann Brain paradox.\nIn the usual picture of eternal inflation expansion is eternal. This leads to Boltzmann\nbrain observers that form at late times from thermal or vacuum fluctuations (see for example\n[43]). Again volume weighting of the expanding regions leads to an infinite number of\nBoltzmann brains in comparison with ordinary observers living around the time of cosmic\ncoincidence. Since Boltzmann brains would infinitely dominate over ordinary observers,\nobservations like ours would be atypical. Again a suitable solution to the measure problem\nis needed to cure the putative catastrophe of Boltzmann brains.\nIn the present scenario, semiclassical physics breaks down long before Boltzmann brains\nbecome an issue, and the problem is avoided. If the entropy of a Boltzmann brain is SBB \u226b 1\nthe timescale for formation will be of order\n\u03c4BB = ldS eSBB .\n\n(15)\n\nThis is to be compared with the timescale at which semiclassical physics breaks down (6).\n25\n\n\fHaving a separation of scales between ldS and lpl so that semiclassical physics is valid requires\nsome fine tuning, but these scales appear inside a log in (6). A much higher degree of fine\ntuning is needed to make this time larger than (15). Therefore most worldlines will not see\ndominance of Boltzmann brain observers.\nIf one does manage to find a region of the landscape where (15) is less than (6), one\nstill avoids eternal expansion of the bubble because the worldline eventually tunnels back\nto the stable AdS region as described in section V on timescale given in (5). We conclude\nthat while there may be regions of the landscape where Boltzmann brain observers could\ndominate, extreme fine tuning is required. A detailed specification of the CFT would be\nneeded to make sharper statements.\nIn the scenario where an expanding bubble lives inside an exterior SAdS geometry, there\nis a different type of Boltzmann brain that can appear in the exterior region. These are\npotentially more dangerous. Consider the history of such an observer who is created by\na thermal fluctuation outside the Schwarzschild black hole. Such an observer will follow a\ntimelike geodesic, and will enter the black hole horizon and hit the singularity on a timescale\nof order rbh . Semiclassical gravity should be a good approximation in this exterior region,\nand modulo Poincare recurrences, this region is eternal. Therefore we expect a substantial\nnumber of such observers to appear and this number could overwhelm the number of ordinary\nobservers.\nIn this scenario, the stable AdS vacuum state is supersymmetric, so atoms and other\ncomplex bound states will not appear. Thus the kind of complex quasi-stable bound state\ncorresponding to a Boltzmann brain may simply not appear in this region. Rather such an\nobserver would likely need a large supersymmetry breaking bubble to surround her, which\nleads us back to the original scenario.\nAlternatively, for observables of interest to us, we can condition probabilities by the\nrequirement that observers live in an expanding phase. This rules out this dangerous class of\nBoltzmann brain observers. While it is straightforward to impose this condition in the limit\nlpl \u2192 0 where semiclassical gravity is valid, it remains to be seen whether this distinction is\npossible in the full quantum regime.\n\n26\n\n\f5.\n\nProblems of time\n\nThe time coordinate is not a physical observable in a diffeomorphism invariant formulation\nof gravity. Usually the way around this is to use a rolling scalar field to define an invariant\nnotion of time. However this then raises issues with recovering locality and causality. These\nissues are reviewed in [60].\nIn the AdS/CFT context, time on the conformal boundary provides a global time coordinate. The CFT comes equipped with a well-defined norm, and time evolution in the\nconformal field theory is unitarity. The CFT norm induces a well-defined measure on the\nspace of bubble cosmologies, of which (10) is a simple example. Less clear is how bulk\nlocality and causality emerges, but this is a topic under active investigation.\nAnother problem of time is how the arrow of time arises in a CPT invariant theory such\nas gravity. Let assume the history shown in figure (5) effectively explores the microcanonical\nensemble in the CFT. In addition to expanding bubble states, by CPT invariance we will\nalso have an equal number of time-reversed collapsing bubble states. However any given\nmacroscopic bubble solution that gives an expanding or contracting region de Sitter region\nwill necessarily be time asymmetric [13]. Thus in this scenario the arrow of time arises from\nspontaneous symmetry breaking: the underlying theory is CPT invariant, but the solutions\nbreak this symmetry.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe research of D.A.L. and S.R. is supported in part by DOE grant DE-FG02-91ER40688Task A.

The proper time along the bubble wall \u03c4 satisfies (1)\nwith the radial coordinate r(\u03c4 ) determined by (2). This allows us to determine tSAdS (r) at\nthe bubble wall via\n\n27\n\n\fdtSAdS = dr\n\n\u0012\n\n1\nfSAdS (r)\n\n\u0012\n\n1\nfSAdS (r)\n\n\u2212\n\n1\nVef f (r)\n\n\u0013\u00131/2\n\n.\n\nIntegrating in the approximation, r \u2192 \u221e,\ns\n2\n4\n2\nldS\n4\u03ba2 lAdS\nlAdS\ntSAdS (r) = B \u2212 A\n, A= 1+ 2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nr\nldS\n\u2212 1)) + 4lAdS\n(\u03ba2 lAdS\n(lAdS + ldS\n\n(A1)\n\nwith B an integration constant. We see the bubble reaches r = \u221e at finite Schwarzschild\ntime tSAdS = B.\nIn the interior, the r coordinate becomes timelike for r > ldS , while tdS approaches a\nconstant on the bubble wall tdS = C. Now let us transform to comoving time \u03c4dS in the de\nSitter patch, working with flat spatial slices\n2\n2 2\u03c4dS\nds2 = \u2212d\u03c4dS\n+ ldS\ne d~x2 .\n\nThe comoving time \u03c4dS is related to r by\n\u03c4dS = ldS log\n\n\u0012\n\nr\nldS\n\n\u0013\n\nso inserting this into (A1) we obtain\ntSAdS = B \u2212\n\n2\n\u03c4\nAlAdS\n\u2212 dS\ne ldS .\nldS\n\n(A2)\n\nNow the semiclassical approximation is not expected to continue to hold very close to the\nnull singularity induced by back-reaction(4). If we assume the semiclassical approximation\nholds to tSAdS = B \u2212 lpl this translates into breakdown at comoving de Sitter time\n\u0012 2 \u0013\nAlAdS\n\u03c4dS = ldS log\n.\nlpl ldS\nAppendix B: Modeling the bubble signature\n\nIn section IV B, the signatures of the bubble state in the CFT are described. One such\nsignature is radiation propagating through the bubble wall and out to infinity in the AdS\nregion, which can be related straightforwardly to CFT correlators. In this appendix, we\ndevelop a simple model for this radiation signature. Working in the semiclassical probe\napproximation we consider a massless (conformal) scalar field propagating in this bubble\n28\n\n\fgeometry with the purely reflective boundary conditions at the bubble wall and zero flux at\nthe AdS spacelike infinity. For computational convenience we specialize to (1 + 1)-d. Since\nall space times are conformal to flat (Minkowski) space time in (1 + 1)-d, this is conformally\nmapped to the propagation of a scalar field in a flat background with moving mirror [61].\nIntroduce null coordinates u, v on the flat spacetime\nds2 = dudv .\nThe moving mirror boundary follows the trajectory x(u), \u03c4 (u) where u \u2261 \u03c4 (u) \u2212 x(u). The\nmodes solutions are,\n\u03c6\u03c9 = e\u2212i\u03c9v + e\u2212i\u03c9p(u)\nwhere\np(u) = 2\u03c4 (u) \u2212 u.\nIn the mirror rest frame (U,V ) with mirror at the origin,\n\nV = v,\n\nU = p(u)\n\nor,\nds2 = dudv =\n\n1\np\u2032 (u)\n\ndUdV .\n\nPerforming a conformal transformation, the energy flux in u, v frame [61], is\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 p \u2032 2\n1\nTuu =\np \u2202u \u221a \u2032 .\n12\u03c0\np\nNow lets move on to pure AdS2 .

So for the uniformly\naccelerating mirror we have,\np(u) = \u2212\u03b1\u22122 u\u22121 .\n30\n\n\fThe energy flux at infinity can readily be checked to be finite.\nThe calculation can be generalized to the SAdS black hole in 1 + 1-d and the same qualitative results are obtained, though formulas are more complicated. The stress-energy tensor\nsplits into two different components: Hawking radiation of the black hole; the contribution\nfrom the reflection from the moving mirror. The reflected radiation just alters the black\nhole mass as argued in the above calculation by a finite amount. We conclude the path of\nthe bubble may be deduced from the radiation received at infinity in the AdS region.\nA more realistic model would derive the boundary conditions of the fields from the detailed\nknowledge of the gravity theory, including the potential of figure 1. In this case the radiation\nreaching infinity in the AdS region will also contain information on the internal state of the\nbubble, and consequently, this information will show up CFT correlation functions in a\nbubble state.\n\n[1] A.
