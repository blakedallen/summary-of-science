Nonsingular bounces were proposed a long time ago [1].\nThey were studied in models motivated by approaches to\nquantum gravity such as modified gravity models [2, 3],\nhigher derivative gravity actions (see e.g. [4\u20136]), nonrelativistic gravitational actions [7\u201310], brane world scenarios [11, 12], \"Pre-Big-Bang\" [13] and Ekpyrotic [14]\ncosmology 1 , or loop quantum cosmology [18]. Bouncing\ncosmologies can also be obtained using arguments from\nsuperstring theory. For example, the string gas cosmology scenario [19, 20] may be embedded in a bouncing\nuniverse as realized in [21]. Non-singular bounces may\nalso be studied using effective field theory techniques by\nintroducing matter fields violating certain energy conditions, for example non-conventional fluids [22, 23], quintom matter [24\u201328], or ghost condensates [16, 17, 29]. A\nspecific realization of a quintom bounce occurs in the LeeWick cosmology studied in [30]. Various original bounce\nmodels were reviewed in Ref. [31].\nIn the context of studies of bouncing cosmologies it\nhas been realized that fluctuations which are generated\nas quantum vacuum perturbations and exit the Hubble\nradius during a matter-dominated contracting phase lead\nto a scale-invariant spectrum of cosmological fluctuations\ntoday [32, 33] (see also [34] for an earlier discussion).\nThis yields an alternative to inflation for explaining the\ncurrent observational data, which is dubbed as the matter\nbounce (see e.g. [35] for a recent review). However, in\nthis scenario there are still unclear issues. For example,\nsince scalar and tensor modes grow at the same rate in\na matter-dominated phase of contraction, the tensor-toscalar ratio is typically too large to be consistent with\ncurrent observational data. Also, the possible generation\nof entropy during the non-singular bounce phase needs\n\n1\n\nSome versions are non-singular, see e.g. [15] in the case of the\nPre-Big-Bang scenario, or the \"New Ekpyrotic scenario\" [16, 17].\n\nto be studied in detail. In this paper, we will focus on\nthe first question, leaving the second for a followup paper\n[36].\nTo date, entropy fluctuations have not been considered\nin matter bounce models. However, realistic matter theories will contain many entropy modes. In the context of\ninflationary cosmology, it has been realized that entropy\nfluctuations can lead to an additional source of curvature\nfluctuations, a source which may in fact dominate [37\u2013\n41]. This is now know as the \"curvaton mechanism\" for\ngenerating fluctuations. Entropy fluctuations also play\nan important role in the Ekpyrotic scenario [16, 17, 42\u2013\n44]. In that scenario, the primordial adiabatic fluctuations in the contracting phase acquire a steep blue spectrum, whereas the entropy modes induced by light scalar\nfields will be scale-invariant.\nIn this paper, we will consider the fluctuations induced\nby a light spectator field \u03c7 and see that they acquire\na scale-invariant spectrum of fluctuations in a matterdominated phase of contraction if they originate in their\nvacuum state on sub-Hubble scales. We will show that\nthese entropy fluctuations induce a scale-invariant spectrum of curvature perturbations after the bounce. The\ntransfer of entropy to adiabatic perturbations occurs during the bounce phase. We can easily find parameter values for which these secondary curvature perturbations\nare larger in magnitude than the primordial ones. This\nwill lead to a suppression of the tensor to scalar ratio.\nAs a simple example, we consider a two-field model\nwith potential\nV (\u03c6, \u03c7) =\n\n1 2 2 1 2 2 2\nm \u03c6 + g \u03c6 \u03c7 ,\n2\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere in our model \u03c6 is the background scalar field in the\nnonsingular bounce cosmology, and \u03c7 is a second scalar\nmatter field, the so-called entropy field 2 .\n\n2\n\nThe non-singular bounce is induced by adding another matter\nfield violating the null energy condition to the system, or by\n\n\f2\nIn the context of a matter bounce background, we\nstudy the cosmological evolution for both background\nand perturbations. We study the specific model given\nby the potential (1). We find that the entropy field \u03c7\nevolves as a tracking solution in the contracting phase\ndue to the coupling to the background scalar \u03c6, and may\nbecome dominant during a short deflationary phase before the bounce. The fluctuations of the entropy field\nare nearly scale-invariant provided the coupling parameter g is small enough. A controllable amplification on\nthe entropy modes due to the kinetic term of the entropy\nfield can be obtained in the bouncing phase, and these\nentropy modes will be converted to curvature perturbations during the bounce. Therefore, we can obtain an\nenhancement of the primordial curvature spectrum and\nhence a suppression of the tensor-to-scalar ratio. This is\nthe main message of this work. Another interesting fact\nis that the conversion of entropy fluctuations to curvature perturbation provides a sizable non-Gaussianity for\ncurvature perturbations for which the sign tends to be\nnegative.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section II we\nprovide the basic equations of the theory. In section III\nwe study the generation of isocurvature fluctuations in\nthe contracting phase. In section IV we analyze the conversion of the isocurvature perturbations into curvature\nfluctuations during the bounce and show that a reasonable amplitude of the primordial power spectrum can be\nobtained. Section V presents a summary and discussions\nof related works.\n\u221a\nWe use the convention mpl = 1/ G in this paper.\n\nII.\n\nSETUP AND BASIC EQUATIONS\n\nTo be specific, we will be considering the background\nspace-time which emerges from a quintom bounce (see for\nexample [30]) scenario in which regular matter is modelled by a scalar field \u03c6 with mass m and the non-singular\nbounce is induced by adding a ghost scalar field \u03c8g with\na much larger mass M to the system. Fig. 1 is a sketch of\nthe evolution of scales in our matter bounce model. The\nvertical axis represents conformal time, the horizontal\naxis comoving distance. Initially, both the regular matter\nfield and the ghost field are oscillating, with amplitudes\nwhich are increasing since the universe is contracting.\nDuring this period, the Hubble radius is decreasing lin-\n\nconsidering the matter Lagrangian containing the regular fields\n\u03c6 and \u03c7 in the presence of a gravitational action leading to a\nbounce. Note that in a successful bouncing cosmology the usual\nenergy conditions need to be recovered after the bounce so that\nthe universe is able to evolve smoothly into the radiation and\nmatter dominated periods. This feature exactly coincides with\nwhat occurs in the quintom dark energy model[45], in which the\ndark energy equation of state crosses the cosmological constant\nboundary.\n\nearly and \u1e22 < 0. We assume that the energy density is\ndominated by the regular field \u03c6. Once the amplitude of\nthe regular field \u03c6 reaches the value mpl , the field will\ncease to oscillate. This happens at conformal time \u03c4m .\nA short deflationary \"slow climb\" phase will begin during which the Hubble radius |H|\u22121 is nearly constant. In\nthis period the ghost field continues to oscillate. Hence,\nthe (negative) energy density of the ghost field catches\nup to the (positive) energy density of the field \u03c6 and a\nshort non-singular bounce period will result during which\n\u1e22 > 0. The conformal time \u03c4d is the transition between\nthe deflationary phase and the bounce period. After the\nbouncing phase there is a short period of inflation lasting\nuntil \u03c4R , after which the universe enters the expanding\nphase with a normal thermal history. We denote the\nbounce time by \u03c4B .\n\u03a4\n\n\u03c4\n\n\u03c4R\n|H|- 1\n\n\u03c4B\n\nXx\n\n\u03c4d\n\u03c4m\n\n\u03bb= 1/k\nFIG. 1: A sketch of the evolution of scales in a nonsingular\nbouncing universe. The horizontal axis is comoving spatial\ncoordinate, the vertical axis is conformal time. Plotted are\nthe Hubble radius |H|\u22121 and the wavelength \u03bb of a fluctuation\nwith comoving wavenumber k.\n\nIn Fig. 1 we plot the evolution of the length corresponding to a fixed comoving scale. This scale is the\nwavelength of the fluctuation mode k (k standing for the\ncomoving wavenumber) which we want to follow. The\nwavelength begins in the contracting phase inside the\nHubble radius, exits the Hubble radius during this phase\nand re-enters the Hubble radius during the normal expanding phase.\nIt is important that scales of interest exit the Hubble radius in the matter-dominated phase of contraction.\nThis is required to obtain a scale-invariant spectrum of\ncosmological perturbations. Important is also that there\nis a phase during which the energy density in the entropy\nfield grows relative to the energy density in the field \u03c6.\nThis condition is easily satisfied in the quintom bounce\nscenario. It is required in order that the conversion of\nthe entropy fluctuations to curvature perturbations is ef-\n\n\f3\nficient 3 . The efficiency of our transfer mechanism will\ndepend on whether the initial energy density of the entropy field \u03c7 is larger than the (absolute value of) the\nenergy density in the ghost field \u03c8g . We shall see that\nour mechanism is more efficient if \u03c7 dominates 4 .\nThe key goal of our paper is to understand how entropy\nperturbations are generated in the contracting phase,\nthen pass through the bounce, and finally convert into\ncurvature perturbations after the bounce. In the following, we will study cosmological perturbation theory in the\nnonsingular bouncing cosmological background described\nabove.\nWe shall work in longitudinal gauge in which the linearized scalar metric fluctuations appear in the metric in\nthe following way:\nds2 = (1 + 2\u03a6)dt2 \u2212 a2 (t)(1 \u2212 2\u03a8)d~x2 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere t is cosmic time and xi are the comoving spatial\ncoordinates. The scalar metric fluctuations are characterized by two functions \u03a6 and \u03a8 which depend both on\nspace and time. We take matter to consist of a set of\nscalar fields \u03c6i . If the gravitational action is the usual\none, then in the absence of linearized anisotropic stress 5\nthe off-diagonal components of the perturbative Einstein\nequations imply \u03a8 = \u03a6 (see [47] for a comprehensive discussion of the theory of cosmological perturbations). By\nexpanding the Einstein and matter equations to first order, we obtain the following perturbation equations [48\u2013\n50]:\n\u03b4 \u03c6\u0308i + 3H\u03b4 \u03c6\u0307i + [\u2212\n\nX\n\u22072\nV,ij \u03b4\u03c6j ]\n\u03b4\u03c6\n+\ni\na2\nj\n\n= 4\u03c6\u0307i \u03a6\u0307 \u2212 2V,i \u03a6 ,\n\n\u22072\n\u2212 3H 2 )\u03a6\na2 X\n[\u03c6\u0307i \u03b4 \u03c6\u0307i \u2212 \u03c6\u03072i \u03a6 + V,i \u03b4\u03c6i ] ,\n= 4\u03c0G\n\n(3)\n\n\u22123H \u03a6\u0307 + (\n\n(4)\n\ni\n\n\u03a6\u0307 + H\u03a6 = 4\u03c0G\n\nX\n\n\u03c6\u0307i \u03b4\u03c6i ,\n\n(5)\n\ni\n\nwhere H = \u0227/a is the Hubble parameter, and V,i denotes\nthe derivative of the scalar field potential with respect to\n\u03c6i .\n\n3\n4\n\n5\n\nThis is similar to the requirement in inflationary cosmology for\nthe curvaton mechanism to be efficient.\nIt would be of great interest to study to what extent the conversion of entropy fluctuations to curvature perturbations is efficient\nin other bounce models such as the ghost condensate scenario of\n[29] which is (unlike the quintom bounce [46]) free of ghosts at\nthe perturbative level, and stable against the addition of radiation and anisotropic stress.\nThis will be the case if matter is described by a set of scalar\nfields.\n\nWe can recast the above equations in terms of the\nSasaki-Mukhanov variables [51, 52] which are defined as\nQi \u2261 \u03b4\u03c6i +\n\n\u03c6\u0307i\n\u03a6,\nH\n\n(6)\n\nand in terms of which the equations of motion are given\nby\nQ\u0308i + 3H Q\u0307i \u2212\n\nX\n\u22072\n8\u03c0G a3\n[V\n\u2212\nQ\n+\n( \u03c6\u0307i \u03c6\u0307j ). ]Qj = 0 .\n,ij\ni\n3\na2\na\nH\nj\n\n(7)\nTo combine the above equations, we usually define the\nquantity \u03b6 which is the curvature perturbation on the\nuniform density slice, and which is given by\nP\n\u03c6\u0307i Qi\n(8)\n\u03b6 = H Pi 2 .\nj \u03c6\u0307j\n\nThis quantity is conserved on super-Hubble scales in an\nexpanding universe if there are only adiabatic fluctuations. However, the presence of entropy fluctuations on\nlarge scales will lead to a growth of \u03b6 which corresponds\nto the seeding of an adiabatic fluctuation mode by the\nentropy mode.\nAt linear order, the general equation for the time\nderivative of \u03b6 is (see Appendix)\n\u03b6\u0307 = \u2212\n\nX Qi \u03c6\u03072\nH 2\n( i ). .\n\u2207 \u03a6 \u2212 4\u03c0GH\n\u1e22\n\u03c6\u0307\ni \u1e22\ni\n\n(9)\n\nOn large scales, the first term of the r.h.s of Eq. (9) is\nnegligible. In a two field model, this equation reduces to\nthe following expression for the time derivative of \u03b6 on\nlarge scales:\nQ\u03c7 d \u03c6\u03072 \u2212 \u03c7\u03072\n\u03c6\u03072 + \u03c7\u03072 Q\u03c6\n\u2212\n) , (10)\n[\n] (\n(1 + w)\u03b6 \u0307 = 4\u03c0G\n3H\n\u03c7\u0307 dt \u03c6\u03072 + \u03c7\u03072\n\u03c6\u0307\nwhere w = p/\u03c1 is the equation of state, with p and \u03c1 being\npressure and energy density respectively. Note, however,\nthat in our case we have three fields, the regular matter\nfield \u03c6, the isocurvature field \u03c7 and the ghost matter\nfield \u03c8g which is responsible for yielding the non-singular\nbounce.\nIn the following we will study how in our non-singular\nbouncing cosmology the presence of primordial isocurvature fluctuations induces via (9) a contribution to the\ncurvature perturbations. We will consider two cases: the\nfirst where the isocurvature field \u03c7 initially contributes\nmore to the density than the ghost field, the second case\nwhere \u03c7 is sub-dominant at the background level to the\nghost field.\nIII.\n\nISOCURVATURE PERTURBATIONS IN\nTHE CONTRACTING PHASE\n\nIn this section we show that the isocurvature mode acquires a scale-invariant spectrum of fluctuations on scales\n\n\f4\nwhich exit the Hubble radius in the matter-dominated\nphase of contraction, provided the initial conditions are\ntaken to be vacuum. We will consider the model of (1),\nwhere the entropy mode corresponds to the scalar field \u03c7\nwhich is taken to be massless. Note that since the ghost\nfield \u03c8g has a large mass, its spectrum will not be scaleinvariant. It will be highly suppressed in the infrared.\nHence, \u03c8g cannot play the role of the entropy field for\nour purpose.\nWe consider a matter bounce background evolution of\na FRW universe in which the matter-dominated phase\nof contraction is realized by the oscillations of a massive scalar field \u03c6 around it vacuum state (see Refs.\n[32, 33, 53, 54] for other realizations). Hence, the Hubble\nparameter can be approximately expressed by\nhH(t)i =\n\n2\n,\n3t\n\n(11)\n\nwhere the angular brackets stand for averaging over time.\nThe solution for the scalar field \u03c6 can be asymptotically\nexpressed as\n\u03c6(t) \u2243 \u03c6\u0303(t) sin mt ,\n\nacquire a scale-invariant spectrum in the matter bounce\nscenario is based on assuming that the canonically normalized curvature fluctuation variable starts out in its\nvacuum state early in the contracting phase. It is hence\nreasonable to assume that also the fluctuations of \u03c7 start\nout in their vacuum state on scales smaller than the\nHubble radius early in the contracting phase. We focus on scale which exit the Hubble radius in the matterdominated phase of contraction and will show that due\nto the growth of fluctuations on super-Hubble scales a\nflat spectrum of isocurvature perturbations results 6 .\nWe are interested in the scalar perturbation \u03b4\u03c7, where\nwe write\n\u03c7(t, ~x) = \u03c7(t) + \u03b4\u03c7(t, ~x) .\n\nIt is important to focus on the canonically normalized\nperturbation variable v = a\u03b4\u03c7 in terms of which quantum vacuum initial conditions can be imposed. We work\non the spatially-flat slice where the metric fluctuation\n\u03a6 vanishes. On this slice, the scalar field perturbations\nsatisfy the Klein-Gordon equation[61]\n\n(12)\n\nvk\u2032\u2032 + (k 2 + a2 m2\u03c7 \u2212\n\nwith a time dependent amplitude,\nmpl\n,\n\u03c6\u0303(t) \u2261 \u221a\n3\u03c0m|t|\n\n(13)\n\nwhich yields an equation of state which has vanishing\npressure after averaging over an oscillation period of the\nfield.\nSince the entropy field \u03c7 is much lighter than the background scalar \u03c6 and we assume that it does not have a\nlarge initial homogeneous mode, it has nothing to do with\nthe background evolution before the bounce phase. Its\nevolution is determined by the equation of motion\n1\n\u03c7\u0308 + 3H \u03c7\u0307 + g 2 \u03c6\u03032 \u03c7 \u2243 0 ,\n2\n\n(14)\n\nwhere we have averaged the coherent oscillations of the\nbackground scalar in the mass term and inserted a factor\n1/2 instead (parametric resonance instabilities resulting\nas a consequence of the oscillatory nature of \u03c6 [55\u201358] see [59] for a recent review - will be studied in a subsequent paper). This equation yields the following solution\nfor \u03c7:\n\u03c7(t) \u221d t\n\n\u22121+\n\ng 2 m2\npl\n3\u03c0m2\n\n,\n\n(15)\n\nwhich evolves at the same rate as the amplitude of the\nbackground scalar if gmpl \u226a m. In this case it is convenient to define a parameter d1 \u2261 \u03c7\u03c6ii (where the subscripts\n\"i\" indicate the initial value of the corresponding fields),\nand then in the matter-dominated contracting phase we\nhave \u03c7 \u2243 d1 \u03c6.\nLet us now turn to the fluctuations of \u03c7. Let us recall [32, 33] that the finding that curvature fluctuations\n\n(16)\n\na\u2032\u2032\n)vk = 0 ,\na\n\n(17)\n\nwhere we have defined the effective mass term of the entropy field m2\u03c7 = V,\u03c7\u03c7 and made use of the conformal\ntime d\u03b7 = adt. A prime indicates a derivative with respect to \u03b7. Comparing the above equation of motion with\nthe basic perturbation equation (7), one may notice that\nthe effective mass originating from the kinetic term of \u03c7\nand the coupling between the isocurvaure and adiabatic\nperturbations has been neglected. This is justified since\nit is subdominant in the matter-dominated contracting\nphase.\nInitially, the k 2 term dominates Eq. (17), and so we\ncan neglect the mass term and gravitational term. Thus,\nthe dynamics corresponds to a free scalar propagating in\na flat spacetime, and the initial condition takes the form\nof the Bunch-Davies vacuum:\ne\u2212ik\u03c4\nvk \u2243 \u221a\n.\n2k\n\n(18)\n\nDuring the phase of background contraction, the quantum fluctuations exit the Hubble radius and become classical perturbations (see [62, 63] for an analysis of the\nclassicalization). For a \u221d \u03c4 2 and |m2\u03c7 | \u226a H 2 , Eq. (17)\nbecomes\nvk\u2032\u2032 + (k 2 \u2212\n\n6\n\n2\n)vk \u2243 0 .\n\u03c42\n\n(19)\n\nAs discussed in [60], the spectrum has a break at the scale which\nexits the Hubble radius at the time of the transition between the\nmatter-dominated phase of contraction and the following phase\n(most likely a radiation-dominated phase). On smaller scales the\nspectrum will be blue.\n\n\f5\nThe second term inside the parentheses on the left hand\nside of this equation is the term which leads to the squeezing of the fluctuations, and the coefficient and time dependence is exactly that required to transform a blue vacuum spectrum into a scale-invariant spectrum [32, 33].\nWe can see this explicitly as follows: Making use of the\nvacuum initial condition, we obtain an exact solution to\n(19):\ne\u2212ik\u03c4\ni\n).\nvk = \u221a (1 \u2212\nk\u03c4\n2k\n\n(20)\n\nNote that, in contracting phase these perturbations are\nable to grow outside the Hubble radius. Their amplitudes will keep increasing until the universe enters the\ncontracting phase ends. Thus, from (20) it follows that\non scales larger than the Hubble radius, the amplitude of\nthe spectrum of \u03b4\u03c7 in the contracting phase is given by\n1\n\n\u03b4\u03c7(t) = P\u03c72 (t) =\n\n|H(t)|\n,\n4\u03c0\n\n(21)\n\nobservations on the value of r, it is necessary that there\nbe a mechanism to amplify the size of the scalar metric perturbations. In the following we will show that the\nentropy mode studied in this paper can provide an efficient mechanism to enhance the spectrum of curvature\nfluctuations.\nThe basic idea is as follows: We expect that the entropy field will rapidly grow during the final instances of\nthe contracting phase. In this case, isocurvature perturbations can be converted into curvature perturbations as\ndescribed by (10) 7 . After the bounce, the evolution of\nthe universe will enter the normal thermal history. In\ncontrast to the bounce scenario without entropy modes,\nin the current model the energy scale for the bounce is\nable to be lowered and so the amplitude of tensor spectrum can be suppressed. Therefore, our model can solve\nthe problem of large tensor-to-scalar ratio which generally exists in nonsingular bounce cosmologies [30, 61].\nMoreover, if the energy scale can be lowered to the TeV\nlevel, our scenario may lead to a window to test a bounce\nin particle physics.\n\nwhich is a function of cosmic time. From Eq. (17), we\nare able to calculate the spectral tilt n\u03c7 of the primordial\nperturbations\nn\u03c7 \u2261\n\n2m2\u03c7\nd ln P\u03c7\n,\n=\nd ln k\n3H 2\n\n(22)\n\nwhere m\u03c7 is the effective mass of the \u03c7 field induced by\nthe coupling to \u03c6. In the specific model given by (1), we\napply the amplitude of the background scalar \u03c6\u0303 and the\nratio d, and then obtain the spectral tilt\nn\u03c7 \u2243\n\ng 2 m2pl\n.\n2\u03c0m2\n\n(23)\n\nFrom this result, we find that in order to ensure that the\nisocurvature perturbation\n\u221a are nearly scale-invariant, one\nhas to require |gmpl | \u226a 2\u03c0m.\nOne can also estimate the amplitude of tensor perturbations h. It is well known that the tensor fluctuation\namplitude satisfies the same equation of motion as a free\nscalar field in the given cosmological background. Hence,\nfollowing the analysis done above for the fluctuations in\nthe scalar field \u03c7, we obtain a scale-invariant spectrum\nof tensor modes (again assuming that they start out in\ntheir vacuum state), and an amplitude of the spectrum\ngiven by\nh \u223c H/mpl .\n\nIV. EVOLUTION OF ISOCURVATURE\nPERTURBATIONS THROUGH THE BOUNCE\n\nAs the universe contracts in the matter-dominated\nphase, the Hubble parameter increases. When it catches\nup to the mass m of the background field \u03c6, the oscillations of this field will freeze out. After freeze-out, \u03c6 will\nslowly climb up the potential. As long as the total energy density is dominated by \u03c6, the equation of state will\ndecrease from w = 0 to w \u2243 \u22121. Therefore, the universe\nwill enter a contracting deflationary period and then approach the bouncing point. During this phase, both the\nisocurvature field \u03c7 and the ghost field \u03c8g will increase\nexponentially in amplitude. Thus, after a brief deflationary phase either \u03c7 or \u03c8g will come to dominate. If the\nenergy density of \u03c8g is larger, then the bounce point is\nreached when the energy densities of \u03c6 and \u03c8g become\nequal. We will denote this case as \"Case 2\". In the\nother case (\"Case 1\") there will be another brief phase of\ncontraction driven by \u03c7, followed by another brief deflationary phase and a bounce when \u03c1\u03c7 = |\u03c1\u03c8g |. Note that\nthe deflationary phases can be understood as the time\nreversal of a period of slow-roll inflation.\n\n(24)\n\nThe tensor perturbation amplitude has the same order\nof magnitude as that of the adiabatic scalar metric perturbations. Thus (in terms of the usual ratio r \u2261 PT /P\u03b6\nof the tensor to scalar metric power spectrum), the matter bounce usually leads to a dangerously large value of\nr. From current observational CMB data [64], this ratio\nis required to be less than 0.2. Consequently, in order\nthat a matter bounce scenario be consistent with current\n\nA.\n\nDeflationary period\n\nWe first study the evolution of the entropy scalar \u03c7\nin the deflationary period. From studies of chaotic type\n\n7\n\nAs we discuss in our companion paper [36], they can also be\nparametrically amplified when they pass through the bouncing\nphase.\n\n\f6\ninflation models, it is well known that the background\nfield \u03c6 freezes out when its amplitude \u03c6\u0303 becomes of the\norder of the Planck mass, more specifically when\n2mpl\n.\n\u03c6\u0303 \u2261 \u03c6\u0303m = \u221a\n3\u03c0 3\n\n(25)\n\nThis leads to a nearly constant Hubble parameter\nHm = \u2212\n\n4m\n3\u03c0\n\n(26)\n\nand an almost exponentially decreasing scale factor for\nthe universe. In this period, the scalars \u03c7 and \u03c8g will\ngrow exponentially and the density in one of them will\nsoon catch up to the density of background field. The\nbackground equation of motion (14) yields\n\u0015\n\u0014\n4m\n(t \u2212 tm ) ,\n(27)\n\u03c7 \u2243 \u03c7m exp\n\u03c0\nwhich evolves proportional to a\u22123 . Here, the time tm is\nthe end of the matter-dominated epoch of contraction,\nand the subscripts \"m\" on the fields \u03c6 and \u03c7 indicate the\nvalues of those field at the time tm .\nWe will write\n\u03c7m \u2261 d1 \u03c6m\n(\u03c8g )m \u2261 d2 \u03c6m ,\n\n(28)\n\ntd \u2212 tm \u2243\n\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\nln\n4m 4d1\n\n(29)\n\ntd \u2212 tm \u2243\n\n\u03c0\nm\nln\n2m d2 M\n\n(30)\n\nin Case 1 and\n\nin Case 2. The difference between the two cases is due to\nthe fact that \u03c8g is oscillating in the deflationary phase,\nbut \u03c7 is not. Hence, the expressions for the energy density of the two fields take a different form.\nLet us now turn to the evolution of the entropy fluctuations which is given by Eq. (17). In a de Sitter phase\nof contraction the dominant solution is\nvk \u223c a\u22122\n\n(31)\n\n\u03b4\u03c7k \u223c a\u22123 .\n\n(32)\n\nwhich corresponds to\n\nHence, it follows that the power spectrum of \u03b4\u03c7 gets enhanced during the deflationary phase by a factor\n\u03c0 2\n)\n4d1\n\nC = (\n\n(33)\n\nm 4\n)\nd2 M\n\n(34)\n\nin Case 2.\nNote, however, that this amplification does not lead to\na suppression of the tensor to scalar ratio since the tensor modes at the same rate during the deflationary phase.\nIt is only due to matter couplings that a difference between scalar and tensor modes will result. Below, we will\nsee that such an amplification mechanism affecting only\nthe scalar modes results in the post-deflationary phase,\na phase driven by the kinetics of the fields.\nWe do need to worry about the absolute magnitude of\nthe fluctuations. There is the danger that the amplification in the deflationary phase cause the perturbations\nbecome nonlinear. Then, we would lose perturbative control of the analysis. Presumably, this would also imply\nthat space fragments into a gas of black holes rather than\nundergoing a smooth bounce. However, from (33) and\nfrom the fact that the fluctuations start out as quantum\nvacuum perturbations, it appears that this constraint on\nthe parameters is a fairly mild one.\nB.\n\nwhere the values of the coefficients d1 and d2 (both much\nsmaller than 1) depend on the initial conditions. We will\ndenote the larger of the two numbers d1 and d2 by d.\nThe deflationary phase will end when the energy of one\nof the fields \u03c7 and \u03c8g catches up to that in \u03c6. This will\noccur at the moment td given by\n\nC = (\n\nin Case 1 and\n\nPassing through the bouncing phase\n\nIn this subsection we will give a rough analysis of how\nthe fluctuations in \u03c7 pass through the bouncing phase.\nWe will discover that the coupling between the matter\nfields due to the kinetic terms results in a growth of the\nentropy fluctuations without corresponding growth of the\ntensor modes. We call this process kinetic amplification.\nAfter the period of deflation, the scalar \u03c7 continues to\nroll fast, and may even dominate over the background\nscalar \u03c6 (in Case 1 - see the beginning of this section\nfor the definition of what the Cases are). In this case,\nthe universe evolves with a background equation of state\nwhich varies from w \u2243 \u22121 during deflation to w \u2243 1\nduring \u03c7 domination. In this case, the dominant term in\nthe background Friedmann equation is the kinetic term\nof the scalar \u03c7, and leads to a nearly conserved quantity\n\u03c7\u0307/H \u2243 \u03c7\u0307d /Hd \u2243 \u03c7\u0307d /Hm ,\n\n(35)\n\nduring this short period. In addition, from Eq. (27) we\nsee that\n4m\n4m\n\u03c7\u0307d =\n\u03c6\u0303m .\n(36)\n\u03c7d \u2243\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\nAs discussed earlier, eventually the energy density in\nthe ghost field \u03c8g catches up and the bounce phase will\nbe triggered. Thus, the universe will exit the contraction\nphase and the equation of state of the universe will cross\n\u22121 and fall to negative infinity. In order to study the\nevolution of perturbations through the bouncing phase\nanalytically, it is convenient to model the evolution of\nthe Hubble parameter in the following form:\nH = \u03b1t ,\n\n(37)\n\n\f7\nwith some positive coefficient \u03b1 which has dimensions of\nk 2 and whose magnitude is set by the microphysics of the\nbounce. For example, \u03b1 \u2243 m2 in the model of Lee-Wick\nCosmology[30], while in Loop Quantum Cosmology \u03b1 is\ndetermined by a regularized Planck mass[65, 66]. Note\nthat in the above parametrization we have chosen the\ntime of the bounce to be zero.\nTo study the perturbation of the \u03c7 field, it is necessary\nto go back to the complete form of the perturbation equations given by (7). We will focus on the evolution of Q\u03c7 .\nFrom (7) we see that there is a mixing with Q\u03c6 . However,\nsince the frequency of \u03b4\u03c6 is dominated by its mass m, \u03b4\u03c6\nkeeps oscillating even outside the Hubble radius. Hence,\nits amplitude is much smaller than that of \u03b4\u03c7 and therefore we neglect its contribution in the equation of motion\nfor \u03b4\u03c7. Thus, Q\u03c7 effectively decouples from Q\u03c6 . Focusing now on the mass term in the equation of motion for\nQ\u03c7 , we notice that since \u03c7 evolves as a stiff fluid with an\neffective equation of state w = 1, the contribution of its\nkinetic term in the perturbation equation must be taken\ninto account. This contribution is given by the following\nterm:\n\u0012 3 2 \u0013.\n8\u03c0\na \u03c7\u0307\n72\u03c0 \u03c6\u03032m\n\u2212 3 2\n\u2243 \u2212\n(\u03b1 + 3\u03b12 t2 ) , (38)\na mpl\nH\nm2pl\nwhere we have used the relations (35), (36) and (37).\nConsequently, we obtain the following equation of motion for the Fourier modes of the gauge invariant perturbation variable Q\u03c7 ,\nk2\nQ\u0308\u03c7 + 3H Q\u0307\u03c7 + 2 Q\u03c7 + m2\u03c7,eff Q\u03c7 \u2243 0 .\na\n\n=\n\n(39)\n\n72\u03c0\u03b1\u03c6\u03032m\n(1 + 3\u03b1t2 )\nm2pl\n\n4g 2 m2pl\n96\u03b1\n\u2212 2 (1 + 3\u03b1t2 ) .\n3\n3\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\n(40)\n\nThus, we find that in the bouncing phase the contribution\nof the kinetic term to the perturbations of the \u03c7 field\nyields a tachyonic mass term. This results in an increase\nin the magnitude of the fluctuations, a process which we\ncall kinetic amplification. Note that this amplification\ndoes not affect the tensor modes.\nIn analogy with the theory of preheating (see e.g. [59]\nfor a recent review), we suggest that the investigation of\nthe perturbation Q\u03c7 can be simplified by redefining the\nfluctuation variable\n\u03b4Xk \u2261 a3/2 Q\u03c7 k .\n\n(41)\n\nThen, we obtain a simpler form of the equation of motion\nfor the fluctuations. Instead of Eq. (39) we now have\n\u03b4 \u1e8ck + \u03c9k2 \u03b4Xk = 0 ,\n\n\u03c9k2 \u2261\n\nk2\n3\n3\n+ m2\u03c7,eff + H 2 \u2212 \u1e22 ,\na2\n4\n2\n\n(42)\n\n(43)\n\nis the frequency for the k'th mode of the isocurvature\nperturbations.\nConsequently, if\n\u03b1 \u226b g 2 m2pl ,\n\n(44)\n\nthere exists a period \u2212tb < t < tb with\ntb \u2243 |Hm |/\u03b1 = 4m/3\u03b1\u03c0\n\n(45)\n\nnear the bounce point during which the adiabaticity condition is violated and the dispersion relation of the \u03c7 perturbation is unstable in the infrared limit. In this case\nthe evolution of the \u03c7 perturbation can be approximately\nexpressed as [67]\nZ\n\u03b4X \u221d exp[| dt\u03c9(t)|]\n(46)\nin which the integral runs from \u2212tb to tb if \u03b1 \u226b g 2 m2pl .\nAs a consequence, we find that the amplitude of the\nentropy fluctuations obtains a tachyonic amplification\naround the bounce point. Since this instability arises\nfrom the kinetic term of the entropy field, we call this\nprocess kinetic amplification. One can describe the amplification of the infrared modes of isocurvature perturbations in this resonance stage as follows:\n\u03b4\u03c7b = F \u03b4\u03c7d ,\n\nIn the bouncing phase the effective mass term is given by\nm2\u03c7,eff = g 2 \u03c6\u03032m \u2212\n\nwhere\n\nwith an amplification factor\nZ tb\nF = exp[|\ndtw(t)|]\n\u2212tb\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2 y\ny(2+y)+ \u221a32 sinh\u22121 ( 3 )\n\u2243 e\n.\n\n(47)\n\n(48)\n\nIn the above calculation, we have introduced a variable\n2\ny = m\u03b1 which characterizes how fast the bouncing phase\noccurs.\nTo understand the exponent appearing in the amplification factor F , we plot its evolution as a function of\nthe variable y in Fig. 2. One can see that in the limit\nof a fast bounce y \u2192 0 (which corresponds to \u03b1 \u226b m2 )\nthe contribution of kinetic amplification is quite limited\nsince the duration of the bouncing phase is very short.\nIn the case of the Lee-Wick cosmology \u03b1 \u2243 m2 and thus\ngives y \u2243 1, and correspondingly we obtain a value of the\namplification factor F \u2243 21.3 which is quite sizable.\nOne interesting issue which should be noticed that, if\nwe choose the value of the coefficient \u03b1 to be between\ng 2 m2pl and m2 , the amplitude of the isocurvature perturbation will be distinctly amplified. This case corresponds\nto a slow bouncing phase. This amplification becomes\nmore efficient if we take the coupling parameter g 2 to be\nslightly negative which provides a flat tachyonic potential\nfor the entropy field.\n\n\f8\nA.\n\nWe first study the linear curvature fluctuations induced\nby the isocurvature fluctuation. To do this, we return to\nthe general formula (9) which describes the transfer of\nisocurvature to curvature fluctuations.

Since the dominant mode\nof both scalar and tensor fluctuations on super-Hubble\nscales is constant, no further amplification of the entropy\nfluctuations results, nor do scalar and tensor perturbations evolve asymmetrically.\nNow let us take into account both of the amplification\neffects on the \u03c7 fluctuations discussed in the two previous\nsubsections. Combining the relations (33) and (47) and\napplying the relation (21) at the beginning of the period\nof deflation at the time tm , we eventually obtain the following amplitude of the isocurvature perturbations after\nthe bounce\n\u03b4\u03c7f \u2243\n\nm 1\nC2F ,\n3\u03c0 2\n\n(49)\n\non super-Hubble scales.\n\nV.\n\nGENERATION OF METRIC\nPERTURBATIONS\n\nIn the above section we have studied the dynamics of\nisocurvature perturbations in a particular implementation of the matter bounce scenario. Next, we will study\nthe induced curvature fluctuations, the \"matter bounce\ncurvaton\" mechanism. The transfer takes place in the\ndeflationary phase and in the bouncing phase when the\nequation of state of the background is changing because\nof the contribution of the entropy field.\n\nX H\u03b4\u03c6i \u03c6\u03072\n( i ). .\n\u03c6\u0307i \u1e22\ni\n\n(51)\n\nSince the spectrum of the ghost field \u03c8g has a blue\nspectrum due to the large mass of the ghost, the ghost\nfield contribution to (51) can be neglected, and only two\nterms remain in the sum, the one due to \u03c6 and the one\ndue to the entropy field. Since in our realization of the\nbounce scenario the regular matter field \u03c6 is massive, its\ncontribution to (51) is also negligible. A second way to\nsee that the term proportional to \u03b4\u03c6 gives a negligible\ncontribution to (51) is to realize that until the entropy\nfield \u03c7 begins to dominate the background, the factor\n\u03c6\u03072 /\u1e22 is approximately constant and thus the coefficient\nof the \u03b4\u03c6 term vanishes. Thus, (51) can be approximated\nby\n\u03b6\u0307 \u2243 \u22124\u03c0m\u22122\npl\n\nH\u03b4\u03c7 \u03c7\u03072 .\n( ) .\n\u03c7\u0307 \u1e22\n\n(52)\n\nThe right hand side of this expression vanishes at the\nbeginning of the deflationary phase and gradually grows\nuntil the bounce phase is reached. We can approximately\nintegrate the equation to obtain\n\u2206\u03b6 \u2243 \u22124\u03c0m\u22122\npl\n\nH\n\u03c7\u0307\u03b4\u03c7 .\n\u1e22\n\n(53)\n\nLet us first evaluate the magnitude of the induced curvature fluctuations in Case 1, when \u03c1\u03c7 > |\u03c1\u03c8g |. In this\ncase the contribution of the ghost condensate field to \u1e22\nat the time when the deflationary period ends can be\nneglected and\n\u0001\n2\n2\n\u1e22 \u2243 \u22124\u03c0m\u22122\n.\n(54)\npl \u03c6\u0307 + \u03c7\u0307\nWhen the \u03c7 field starts to dominate the energy density,\nthe magnitudes of \u03c7\u0307 and \u03c6\u0307 are comparable, and hence\n\u2206\u03b6 \u2243\n\nH\n\u03b4\u03c7 .\n\u03c7\u0307\n\n(55)\n\nMaking use of the background solution for the scalar \u03c7\nand the amplification of the amplitude of the isocurvature perturbation \u03b4\u03c7f before and during the bounce, we\n\n\f9\nfinally obtain the following estimate for the induced curvature perturbation\n\u2206\u03b6 \u2243\n\n1\nm\n\u221a\nC2F ,\n6 3\u03c0mpl\n\n(56)\n\nwhere we have used relation (35) which is approximately\nvalid during the deflationary and bounce periods.\nNext, let us turn to Case 2. Now, \u1e22 is dominated by\n\u03c8\u0307g instead of by \u03c7\u0307 in the bounce region. The numerator in (53) remains the same as for Case 1. Hence, the\noverall amplitude of the induced curvature fluctuations\nis suppressed by a factor S, where\nS = (\n\n\u03c7\u0307 2\n) ,\n\u03c8\u0307g\n\n(57)\n\ncompared to what happens in Case 1.\nThe tensor modes are also amplified during the deflationary phase, as mentioned earlier. Thus, they also\nobtain the amplification factor C. Their overall amplitude is hence the same as that of the induced curvature\nfluctuations, except for the factor F due to kinetic amplification. Hence, the predicted tensor to scalar ratio r\nin Case 1 is\nr \u2243 F \u22122 .\n\nm \u2243 9.02 \u00d7 10\n\nF\n\n\u22121\n\nmpl .\n\n(59)\n\nFor completeness, let us mention (as was already used\nabove in (58)) that in our model the amplitude of tensor\nperturbation is about h \u223c H/mp . Specifically, following\nthe calculations in Ref. [30], one obtains the following\nprimordial power spectrum for the tensor perturbations\nat the end of the matter dominated phase of contraction\nPT (k) \u2261\n\nWe first numerically study the evolution of two scalars.\nAs demonstrated in Fig. 3, in the era of contraction, the\nheavy field \u03c6 keeps oscillating with an increasing amplitude and dominates the background evolution, while the\nlight field \u03c7 tracks the evolution of \u03c6. When the amplitude of \u03c6 grows up to of Planck mass, \u03c7 rolls rapidly\nand finally catch up to \u03c6 near by the bounce. This numerical result is consistent with the analytic estimates\nappeared in Eqs. (15), (27). However, in our numerical\ncalculations the background evolution ceases around the\nmoment of \u03c7 domination which is before the big bounce.\nSince in the current paper we wish to discuss the dynamics of isocurvature perturbations in a general case,\nwe did not concentrate on a detailed mechanism leading\nto a bouncing phase but take a parametrization of the\nHubble parameter H = \u03b1t instead.\n\n(58)\n\nIts magnitude is determined by two parameters, namely\nthe mass of the heavy field m and the slope of the bouncing phase \u03b1.\nAccording to the latest observations from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 7-year data (WMAP7)\n[64], the amplitude of curvature perturbation is \u03b6 \u2243\n4.92 \u00d7 10\u22125 and the spectral tilt is |n\u03c7 | . 0.03. Thus,\nthe observed amplitude of the curvature perturbations\ncan be obtained in our scenario if we require\n\u22124\n\nOur analytical calculations involve some approximations. Specifically, in the deflationary phase the Hubble\nparameter is not exactly a constant and the background\nscalar \u03c6 is still rolling slowly, but in our analytical analysis we have taken their values at the freeze-out time. As\na consequence, it is important to confirm the results by\na numerical integration of the full equations.\n\n32k 3\n16H 2\n|hk |2 =\n,\n2\n\u03c0mpl\n9\u03c0m2pl\n\n(60)\n\nDuring the deflationary phase, there is an enhancement\nby a factor of C. The tensor-to-scalar ratio is given by\nr \u2243 35F \u22122 .\n\n(61)\n\nThis ratio can be greatly suppressed by a large value of\nthe factor F . In the specific model of Lee-Wick cosmology, \u03b1 \u2243 m2 so that r \u2243 0.08. With the WMAP7 data\ncombined with BAO and SN, the current limit on the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio is given by r < 0.2.\n\n0\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n6\n\n-6x10\n\n6\n\n-5x10\n\n6\n\n-4x10\n\n6\n\n-3x10\n\n6\n\n-2x10\n\n6\n\n-1x10\n\n0\n\nt\n\nFIG. 3: Evolution of the background fields \u03c6 and \u03c7 before\nthe bounce as a function of cosmic time (horizontal axis).\nThe background fields are plotted in dimensionless units by\nnormalizing by mpl . Similarly, the time axis is displayed in\nunits of m\u22121\npl . The parameters m and g appearing in the\npotential were chosen to be m = 10\u22125 mpl , g = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22126 ,\nand we assume initially d = 10\u22124 . The initial conditions for \u03c6\nwere taken to be \u03c6i = 1.19\u00d710\u22125 mpl , \u03c6\u0307i = \u22121.24\u00d710\u22129 mpl 2 .\n\nBased on the background solution obtained above, we\nthen solve the equations of motion (7) numerically. We\nshow the evolution of the gauge-invariant scalar perturbation variables Q\u03c6 and Q\u03c7 in Fig. 4. In the numerical calculations, we consider these perturbation modes\nto originate from vacuum fluctuations inside the Hubble\n\n\f10\nradius 8 . One can see from Fig. 4 that the perturbation\nof the heavy field (the adiabatic mode after the bounce)\ncatches up to the amplitude of the entropy field perturbation. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the \"matter\nbounce curvaton\" mechanism discussed here. Note that\nQ\u03c6 keeps oscillating through the whole evolution. The\namplitude of the fluctuation Q\u03c7 grows before the bounce,\nhowever, with a different slope than the growth of Q\u03c6 .\nThis difference in slope is due to the transfer of isocurvature to curvature fluctuation.

The shape is different than the one which appears in simple inflationary\nmodels since in the contracting phase \u03b6 is not constant\nand hence terms depending on \u03b6\u0307 which vanish in inflationary cosmology contribute in an important way to the\nbispectrum.\nThe second effect is a contribution to the bispectrum of\nlocal form which results from the curvaton mechanism. It\nis due to the transformation of entropy perturbations into\ncurvature fluctuations which happens around the bounce\npoint. Here, we focus on the second effect.\nA naive way to investigate the non-Gaussianity is to\nstudy the cosmological fluctuations to second order[76]\n9\n. Recalling the time evolution of the curvature perturbation given in Eq. (10) and taking the next-to-leading\norder corrections into account, we are able to decompose\nthe curvature perturbation into a Gaussian part and a\nnon-linear one, where the second part evolves according\nto the following equation[83\u201386]:\nH\nH\n(V,ss + 4\u03b8\u03072 )\u03b4s2 \u2212 3 V,\u03c3 \u03b4s\u03b4\u0307s ,\n(62)\n\u03c3\u0307 2\n\u03c3\u0307\non long wavelengths. In the above\nR formula,1 we have introduced the adabatic field \u03c3 = (\u03c6\u03072 + \u03c7\u03072 ) 2 dt, the isocurvature field s = (\u03c6\u0307\u03c7 \u2212 \u03c7\u0307\u03c6)/\u03c3, and the trajectory angle \u03b8\nsatisfying cos \u03b8 = \u03c6\u0307/\u03c3\u0307 and sin \u03b8 = \u03c7\u0307/\u03c3\u0307.\nAs usual, we define a nonlinearity parameter fN L to\nmeasure the amplitude of non-Gaussian perturbations.\nThis parameter is defined by the relation\n\u03b6\u0307N L =\n\n-10\n\n10\n\n-11\n\n10\n\n6\n\n-6.0x10\n\n6\n\n-4.0x10\n\n6\n\n-2.0x10\n\n0.0\n\n6\n\n2.0x10\n\nt\n\nFIG. 4: Evolution of the gauge-invariant scalar perturbations\nQ\u03c6 and Q\u03c7 for super-Hubble mode k = 2\u00d710\u22126 in our model.\nThe horizontal axis is cosmic time. The scalar perturbations\nare plotted in dimensionless units by normalizing by mpl . In\nthe parametrization function \u03b1 = 10\u22126 m2pl is chosen. The\nbackground parameters are the same as in Fig. 3.\n\nB.\n\nLocal non-Gaussian fluctuations\n\nNext we take a first look at an important byproduct of\nthe \"matter bounce curvaton\" scenario, namely a contribution to the induced non-Gaussian distribution of metric fluctuations which will be of local form.\nThere are two important periods for generating a large\nnon-Gaussianity in a bouncing universe. The first is the\nevolution of metric perturbations on super-Hubble scales\nin the contracting phase which at leading non-linear order\ngenerates non-Gaussianities as studied in Refs. [74, 75].\nThis generates an effective value of the non-linearity parameter fnl which is of order one, the largeness being\n\n3\n\u03b6 = \u03b6L + fN L \u03b6L2 ,\n(63)\n5\nwhere \u03b6L is the linear order value of curvature perturbation. As analyzed in the previous section, we consider\nthe leading non-Gaussianity when modes are at superHubble scales, and thus the non-Gaussianity is of the\nlocal type[77, 87].\nWe follow the time evolution of the curvature perturbations and use the solution (21), and then obtain the\nnon-linear part of the curvature perturbation,\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ f\n4m2 \u03c62\nm2 \u03c6\u03072 2\n2\n)\u03b4\u03c7 \u2212 \u03c6\u03c6\u0307\u03b4\u03c7\u03b4 \u03c7\u0307 dt\n\u03b6N L \u2243\nH 6 \u03c7\u0307 (1 +\n\u03c3\u0307\n\u03c3\u0307 2\nm\n32m\n8d2 Cmpl\n\u2243\n(1 \u2212\n)\u03b4\u03c72f ,\n(64)\n3\n\u03c0mpl\n\u03c02 m\nwhere the main contribution is provided by the integral\nfrom tm to td during which the scalar \u03c7 comes to dominate. Moreover, combined with the linear form of the\n\n9\n8\n\nNumerical analyses of inflationary preheating were performed\nwith a massive scalar [68\u201370] and a massless scalar [71, 72] (see\nalso [73]) respectively.\n\nThe issue of inflationary non-Gaussianities has been studied in\ndetail e.g. in Refs. [77, 78] and comprehensively reviewed by\n[79]. Moreover, the non-Gaussian fluctuations during inflationary preheating have been analyzed in [67]; see also [80\u201382].\n\n\f11\ncurvature perturbation (56), we obtain the leading term\nof the nonlinearity parameter\nfN L \u2243 \u2212\n\n5120 2\nd C.\n\u03c06\n\n(65)\n\nAs discussed in the previous sections, there are two\ncases for the choice of d and C parameters depending on\nhow the scalar field \u03c7 becomes dominant. For Case 1, we\nget\nfN L \u2243 \u22123.3 ,\n\n(66)\n\nby making use of C = (\u03c0/4d)2 ; for Case 2, we obtain\nfN L \u2243 \u22125.3\n\nm4\nd2 M 4\n\n.\n\n(67)\n\nIn both two cases, we see that it is possible to generate\na sizable non-Gaussianity in our model by this mechanism. Specifically, a large non-Gaussianity of local type\ncan be obtained for a small value of d in Case 2. For\nexample, taking the value of the parameters to be such\nthat M = 100m which satisfies the theoretical bound\ndiscussed at the end of the Appendix, we find that with\nm\none gets fN L \u2243 \u22125.3, a value which is cond = 10\u22122 M\nsistent with current observational constraints which give\n\u221236 < fN L < 100 at the 2\u03c3 level, but a value which is\nnot too small to be detectable in upcoming experiments.\nAlthough the mechanism discussed above is quite efficient to generate a sizable non-Gaussianity, there are\nother sources which could potentially also give a large\nvalue of fN L . For example, we expect that preheating\neffects will lead to a major contribution. In particular,\nthey will affect the shape of the non-Gaussianities, a topic\nwe did not study here. We will leave the detailed study\nof this issue to a future publication.\n\nbounce, a scenario in which the violation of the null energy condition which is required to obtain a non-singular\nbounce is obtained via the addition of a ghost field. However, the mechanism will also be effective in other realizations of the matter bounce.\nAs we have shown here, just before and during the\nbounce, the entropy fluctuations are amplified by an effective tachyonic mass due to a kinetic resonance. We\nhave called this process \"kinetic amplification\". Whereas\nthe scalar modes are amplified by this mechanism, the\ngravitational waves are not. Thus, our scenario leads to\na suppression of the tensor to scalar ratio r. The kinetic\namplification mechanism is more effective if the bounce\nis slower, since then the time interval during which the\nentropy fluctuations see an effective tachyonic mass is\nlonger. The kinetic amplification mechanism is also more\neffective if the energy density in the entropy field initially\ndominates over the absolute value of the energy density\nin the ghost field.\nWe also have taken a first look at non-Gaussianities\nfrom our mechanism. Specifically, we have discussed\none source of local type non-Gaussianity generated in\nour curvaton mechanism. We find, for typical parameter values, the predicted amplitude is quite sizable to be\nobservationally relevant. There are other sources, however, which are expected to lead to even larger effects.\nNote that there have recently been some attempts to\nseed sizable non-Gaussianity in the framework of inflationary preheating[88\u201391]. The distinguishing difference\nbetween their models and ours is that in our case the\nnon-Gaussian fluctuations arise even for modes in the far\ninfrared, modes relevant for current cosmological observations. However, those in inflation are contributed by\na narrow resonance which puts an upper bound on their\nwavelength [92].\n\nAcknowledgments\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION\n\nIn this paper we introduced the \"matter bounce curvaton\" scenario, a new mechanism to generate a scaleinvariant primordial spectrum of cosmological perturbations in the framework of a nonsingular bounce cosmology with a matter-dominated phase of contraction. This\nmodel is able to solve the \"large r problem\" from which\nmany bouncing cosmologies suffer, while preserving the\nscale-invariance of the power spectrum. Our scenario is\nbased on taking into account the contributions of light\nfields to the curvature fluctuations. The light fields act\nas curvatons. They acquire a scale-invariant spectrum of\nfluctuations on super-Hubble scales during the contracting phase. As we have shown, the change in the equation\nof state immediately before and during the bounce phase\nleads to the transfer of the fluctuations to the adiabatic\nmode, maintaining the scale-invariance of the spectrum.\nWe have studied our mechanism in a concrete realization of the matter bounce scenario, namely the quintom\n\nY.F.C. is supported by funds from the Department\nof Physics at Arizona State University.

Moreover, it is convenient to introduce the Sasaki-Mukhanov variables as defined in the\nSection II, Qi \u2261 \u03b4\u03c6i + \u03c6\u0307Hi \u03a6. Then we precisely obtain\nEq. (9).\nB.\n\nFluctuations in the Deflationary Phase\n\nNow we study the evolution of the entropy scalar \u03c7 in\nthe deflationary process. From studies of chaotic type\ninflation models, it is well known that the background\nfield \u03c6 freezes out when the amplitude \u03c6\u0303 becomes of\nthe order of the Planck mass, more specifically when\n2m\n\u03c6\u0303m = \u221a3\u03c0pl3 . This leads to a nearly constant Hubble\nparameter Hm = \u2212 4m\n3\u03c0 and an almost exponentially decreasing scalar factor for the universe. This phase is crucial to achieving a nonsingular bounce, since the matter\ncomponent, which effectively carries the negative energy\ndensity (namely, the Lee-Wick partner field or a ghost\ncondensate), will grow rapidly and soon catch up to the\ndensity of \u03c6.\nAssuming that the Lee-Wick partner \u03c8 satisfies the\nfollowing background equation of motion,\n\u03c8\u0308 + 3H \u03c8\u0307 + M 2 \u03c8 = 0 ,\n\n(81)\n\n\f13\nit is always oscillating around the stable point of its potential throughout the whole evolution of the universe.\nBefore the deflationary phase, both the amplitudes \u03c8\u0303 and\n\u03c6\u0303 are growing in the same rate. Therefore, it is convenient to define a ratio\nd2 \u2261\n\n\u03c8\u0303\n,\n\u03c6\u0303\n\n(82)\n\nwhich is almost constant until the moment tm , the end of\nthe matter-dominated phase of contraction. Afterwards,\nsolving the background equation of motion (81), one obtains\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2m\n\u03c8\u0303 \u2243 \u03c8\u0303m exp\n(t \u2212 tm ) ,\n(83)\n\u03c0\nwhich evolves proportional to a\u22123/2 . One can compute\nthat the contribution of \u03c8 catches up to that of \u03c6 at the\nmoment\nm\n\u03c0\nln\n(84)\ntd = tm +\n2m d2 M\n\nwhere we have introduced an amplification factor C,\nwhich is determined by\n\nC=(\n\nm 4\n) ,\nd2 M\n\n(86)\n\nindicating that the amplification on the isocurvature perturbation in deflationary process is depressed by the ratio\nm/M but manifestly amplified by d2 . The coefficient d2\nis determined by the the ratio of two background scalar\nfields at low energy scale which is far away before the\nbouncing point. At that moment, the excitation of \u03c8 is\nstrongly suppressed by the mass scale M as illustrated in\nthe Lee-Wick model and the ghost condensate, and thus\nd2 < m/M is satisfied commonly.\n\n(85)\n\nNote that, the above analysis involves an important\nrequirement that the coupling between the background\nscalar \u03c6 and the entropy field \u03c7 is enough week, i.e.,\ng < m/mpl . It is possible to choose a large value of the\ncoupling constant which breaks this bound. This case\ncorresponds to a stochastic resonance for the isocurvature\nperturbation before the bouncing phase, but would spoil\nthe feature of scale-invariance as observed by current experiments. A detailed analysis of stochastic resonance on\nentropy field around the bounce will be performed in an\naccompanied paper in a following up project.\n\n[1] R. C.
