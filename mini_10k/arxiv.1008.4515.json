Introduction\nThe ratio of baryon-number to photon-number densities in our universe has been\nestablished via Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) [1\u20133] and WMAP [4, 5] to be\n\u03b7 =\n\nnB\n\u2248 6 \u00d7 10\u221210 .\nn\u03b3\n\n(1)\n\nThe more precise numbers are\n\u03b710 (BBN : D/H) = 5.8 \u00b1 0.3 ,\n\u03b710 (WMAP: 7yr) = 6.18 \u00b1 0.15 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b710 = 1010 \u03b7, and the BBN value is determined from the deutron abundance\nreported in Ref. [6, 7]. As we can see, the agreement is very good.\nThe objective of baryogenesis is to explain how the above number can come\nabout from a universe initially with zero net baryon number. Since the pioneering\nwork of Sakharov [8], very many proposals have been made as to what this baryogenesis mechanism could be.a Among the early ones was a model by Dimopoulos and\nSusskind [15] in which baryon number is generated via the coherent semi-classical\ntime-evolution of a complex scalar field. Similar mechanisms have been employed\nby Affleck and Dine [16], Cohen and Kaplan [17], and Dolgov and Freese [18], of\nwhich the Affleck-Dine mechanism has been popular and intensely studied due to\nits natural implementability in SUSY models. Two of us have also considered the\n\u2217 Presenting author.\na For recent reviews,\n\nsee Refs.

The Dimopoulos-Susskind Model\nConsider the action of a complex scalar field given by\nZ\ni\n\u221a h\nd4 x \u2212g g \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2020 \u2202\u03bd \u03c6 \u2212 V (\u03c6, \u03c6\u2020 ) .\nS =\n\n(3)\n\nIf the potential V (\u03c6, \u03c6\u2020 ) is invariant under the global change of phase\n\u03c6\u2020 \u2192 e\u2212i\u03be \u03c6\u2020 ,\n\n\u03c6 \u2192 ei\u03be \u03c6 ,\n\nthen the corresponding conserved current is\n\u0011\n\u2194\n\u221a \u0010\nB\u03bc = \u2212g i \u03c6 \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2020 .\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\nIf we identify B0 with the baryon number density, then adding to the action a\npotential which is not invariant under the above phase change, such as\n\u0001\n\u0001\nV0 (\u03c6, \u03c6\u2020 ) = \u03bb \u03c6 + \u03c6\u2020 \u03b1 \u03c63 + \u03b1\u2217 \u03c6\u20203 ,\n|\u03b1| = 1 ,\n(6)\nwould lead to baryon number violation. Furthermore, unless \u03b1 = \u00b11, this potential\nalso violates C and CP since \u03c6 transforms as\nC\n\n\u03c6(t, ~x) \u2212\u2192 \u03c6\u2020 (t, ~x) ,\nCP\n\u03c6(t, ~x) \u2212\u2192 \u00b1\u03c6\u2020 (t, \u2212~x) ,\nwhere the sign under CP depends on the parity of \u03c6. (P is not violated.)\nIn Ref. [15], Dimopoulos and Susskind subject \u03c6 to the potential\n\u0001n\n\u0001\n\u0001\nVn (\u03c6, \u03c6\u2020 ) = \u03bb \u03c6 \u03c6\u2020\n\u03c6 + \u03c6\u2020 \u03b1 \u03c63 + \u03b1\u2217 \u03c6\u20203 .\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nThe purpose of the factor (\u03c6 \u03c6\u2020 )n is simply\nto give the coupling constant \u03bb a negative\n\u221a\nmass dimension. Setting \u03c6 = \u03c6r ei\u03b8 / 2, the baryon number density becomes\n\u221a\nnB = B0 = \u2212g \u03c62r \u03b8\u0307 ,\n(9)\nwhich shows that to generate a non-zero baryon number nB , one must generate a\nnon-zero \u03b8\u0307.

The \u03b8-dependence of this potential for fixed \u03c6r is\nshown in Fig. 1 for the case \u03b2 = \u03c0/2.

So in\nterms of \u03b8, the violation of B is due to the loss of translational invariance, and the\nviolation of C and CP are due to the loss of left-right reflection invariance which\nhappens when \u03b2 6= 0, \u03c0. The question is, can the asymmetric force provided by this\npotential make \u03b8 flow in one preferred direction thereby generate a non-zero \u03b8\u0307? For\nthat, one must move away from thermal equilibrium.\nIn the original Dimopoulos-Susskind paper [15], this shift away from thermal\nequilibrium is accomplished by the expansion of the universe.

If\nn > 0, both force and friction terms vanish in the limit \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e, and it is possible to\nshow that a non-zero nB \u223c d\u03b8/d\u03c4 survives asymptotically, its final value depending\non the initial value of \u03b8. This initial value is expected to vary randomly from domain\nto domain, resulting in different asymptotic baryon numbers in each, and when\nsummed results in an overall net baryon number. On the other hand, if n = 0,\nwhich would make the self-interactions of \u03c6 renormalizable, the friction term will\neventually bring all motion to a full stop.\n3. The Ratchet Mechanism\nA striking feature of the Dimopoulos-Susskind model is its similarity with the\nproblem of biased random walk one encounters in the modeling of biological motors [20\u201322]. An example of a biological motor is the myosin molecule which walks\nalong actin filaments. This molecule is modeled as moving along a periodic sawtoothshaped potential, similar to that shown in Fig. 1. Thermal equilibrium inside a living\norganism is broken by the presence of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) whose hydrolysis into ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and P (phosphate) provides the energy\nrequired to fuel the motion:\nATP \u2192 ADP + P + energy .\n\n(19)\n\nThis is often modeled as a randomly fluctuating temperature of the thermal bath:\nthe molecule is excited out of a potential well during periods of high-temperature,\nallowing it to diffuse into the neighboring ones, and then drops back into a well\nduring periods of low-temperature. Due to the asymmetry of the potential, this sequence can lead to biased motion depending on the depth and width of the repeating\npotential wells, and the height and frequency of the temperature fluctuations.\nb This assumption that |\u03c6\u0302| is constant would require the magnitude of the unscaled field |\u03c6| to\n\u221a\nevolve as 1/\u03c4 = 1/ 2t.\n\n\fOctober 21, 2018\n\n2:36\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9.75in x 6.5in\n\nscgt09-takeuchi-corrected\n\n5\n\nAnalogy with such 'temperature ratchet' models suggests a possible way to drive\nthe evolution of \u03b8 in the Dimopoulos-Susskind model without relying on the nonrenormalizability of the self-interaction of \u03c6, or the expansion of the universe directly. Let us assume the existence of ATP- and ADP-like particles A and B which\ninteract with \u03c6 via the reaction\nA+\u03c6 \u2194 B+\u03c6+Q,\n\n(20)\n\nwhere Q is the energy released in the reaction. A and B are assumed to be stable (or\nhighly meta-stable) states that have fallen out of thermal equilibrium at an earlier\ntime in the evolution of the universe. Though they interact with \u03c6, giving or taking\nenergy away from it, their masses are such that the decay\nA \u2192 B + \u03c6 + \u03c6\u0304\n\n(21)\n\nis kinematically forbidden.\nIn order to isolate the effect of the presence of a bath \u221a\nof these particles, we\nneglect the expansion of the universe and subject \u03c6 = \u03c6r ei\u03b8 / 2 to the n = 0 renormalizable Dimopoulos-Susskind potential V0 (\u03c6r , \u03b8). We again adopt the simplifying\nassumption that the evolution of \u03c6r is suppressed. Though the interactions between\n\u03c6 and the A and B particles occur randomly, we model their effect by a periodically\nfluctuating kinetic energy of \u03b8 [20] :\nh\ni2\nK(t) = K0 1 + A sin(\u03c9t) .\n(22)\nThis function oscillates between Kmin = K0 (1 \u2212 A)2 and Kmax = K0 (1 + A)2 =\nKmin + Q. Therefore,\nQ = 4K0 A .\n\n(23)\n\nThen, the equation of motion of \u03b8 in our model will be given by the Langevin\nequation\n\u03c62r \u03b8\u0308 = \u2212\n\np\n\u2202V0\n\u2212 \u03b7 \u03b8\u0307 + 4\u03b7K(t) \u03be(t) ,\n\u2202\u03b8\n\n(24)\n\nwhere \u03b7 is the coefficient of friction, and \u03be(t) is Gaussian white noise:\nh\u03be(t)i = 0 ,\n\nh\u03be(t)\u03be(s)i = \u03b4(t \u2212 s) .\n\n(25)\n\nThe above Langevin equation is equivalent to the following Fokker-Planck equation\ngoverning the evolution of the probability density p(\u03b8, t) and the probability current\nj(\u03b8, t):\n\u2202p(\u03b8, t) \u2202j(\u03b8, t)\n+\n,\n\u2202t\u0014\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u0015\n1 \u2202V0\n\u2202p(\u03b8, t)\nj(\u03b8, t) = \u2212\np(\u03b8, t) + 2K(t)\n.\n\u03b7 \u2202\u03b8\n\u2202\u03b8\n0=\n\n(26)\n\n\fOctober 21, 2018\n\n2:36\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9.75in x 6.5in\n\nscgt09-takeuchi-corrected\n\n6\n\nJ\n0.001\n5 \u030110-4\n2 \u030110-4\n1 \u030110-4\n5 \u030110-5\n2 \u030110-5\n0.5\n\nFig. 2.\n\n1.0\n\n5.0 10.0\n\n\u03a9\n\n50.0 100.0\n\n\u03c9-dependence of J for the case \u03b2 = \u03c0/2, Kmin = 0.5, Q = \u03b7 = \u03c6r = \u03bb = 1.\n\nThe quantity of interest for baryon number generation is the period-averaged probability current\nZ\n1 T\nJ =\nj(\u03b8, t) dt ,\n(27)\nT 0\nwhich is asymptotically independent of \u03b8 and approaches a constant, a non-zero\nvalue signifying a non-zero baryon number. For the sake of simplicity, we set \u03b2 =\n\u03c0/2, and \u03c6r , \u03bb, and \u03b7 all equal to one. We then solved these equations numerically\nfor various values of Kmin , \u03c9, and Q, and have found that non-zero J can be\ngenerated for a very wide range of parameter choices. As an example, we show the\n\u03c9-dependence of J for the case Kmin = 0.5 and Q = 1 in Fig. 2. Further details of\nour analysis can be found in Ref. [23].\n4. What is the ATP-like particle?\nWhether the ratchet mechanism we are proposing here can be embedded into a\nrealistic scenario remains to be seen. Of particular difficulty may be maintaining\na sufficiently large population of the ATP-like particles to drive the ratchet. But\nwhat can these ATP-like particles be? Several possibilities come to mind: First,\nit could be the inflaton at reheating, transferring energy to the \u03c6 field via parametric resonance. Second, they could be heavy Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes in some\nextra-dimension model. And third, perhaps they could be technibaryons transferring energy to technimeson \u03c6's. Finally, regardless of what their actual identities\nare, if the ATP-like particles are highly stable and still around, they may constitute\ndark matter, thereby connecting baryogenesis with the dark matter problem. These,\nand other possibilities will be discussed elsewhere [24].\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Philip Argyres and Daniel Chung for helpful suggestions.\nT.T. is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, grant DE\u2013FG05\u201392ER40709,\nTask A.\n\n\fOctober 21, 2018\n\n2:36\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9.75in x 6.5in\n\nscgt09-takeuchi-corrected\n\n7\n\nReferences\n[1] S.
