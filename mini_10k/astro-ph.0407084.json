INTRODUCTION\n\nIn the standard fireball model of gamma-ray-bursts\n(GRB's), the observable effects are due to the dissipation of kinetic energy in a highly relativistic fireball (for reviews, see, e.g., Piran 2000; M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros 2002;\nWaxman 2003). The observed radiation is well explained as synchrotron and inverse-Compton emission\nfrom shock accelerated electrons. Electrons accelerated\nin internal shock waves within the expanding fireball produce the prompt \u03b3-ray emission, while electrons accelerated in the external shock wave driven by the fireball into the surrounding medium produce the afterglow emission, from the X to the radio bands, that\ncan last months after the burst (Paczy\u0144ski & Rhoads\n1993; M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros & Rees 1997; Vietri 1997a; Waxman\n1997a; Waxman 1997b; Sari, Piran & Narayan 1998;\nGruzinov & Waxman 1999).\nAt the early stages of the afterglow, as the energy density of the surrounding matter swept by\nthe external shock wave equals the energy density\nof the fireball plasma, a reverse shock crosses the\nfireball plasma (M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros, Rees & Papathanassiou 1994;\nSari & Piran 1995). At this transition phase, lasting\nover a duration comparable to that of the burst itself, both forward and reverse shocks accelerate particles, which subsequently emit the early afterglow.\nEarly optical emission from several GRBs has been\nidentified as reverse shock emission (Akerlof et al.\n(1999); Sari & Piran (1999); M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros & Rees (1999);\nKobayashi (2000); Kobayashi & Sari (2000); Wei\n(2003); Zhang, Kobayashi & M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros (2003)).\n1 Physics faculty, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100,\nIsrael\n2 asaf@wicc.weizmann.ac.il\n\nIn the past few years, evidence accumulated for the existence of a high energy emission component (\u223c 1 GeV \u2212\n1 TeV) associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), which\nare typically observed at much lower energies, few\nkeV to few MeV. Such a component was first observed by EGRET in the \u223c 100 MeV \u2212 18 GeV range\n(Schneid et al. 1992; Hurley et al. 1994). There is evidence for even higher energy, \u223c 1 TeV emission, observed\nin one burst out of 54 BATSE GRBs in the MILAGRITO\nfield of view (Atkins et al. 2000, 2003).\nThe mechanism responsible for high energy photon emission is still controversial.\nHigh energy\nelectrons inverse Compton (IC) scatter low energy photons to high energies, 1 GeV- 1 TeV\n(M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros, Rees & Papathanassiou 1994) extending the\nspectrum to high energy. The exact shape of the\nspectrum depends on the values of the uncertain\nparameters of the model (Chiang & Dermer 1999;\nWang, Dai & Lu 2001; Zhang & M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros 2001). An\nadditional source of high energy emission is the possible acceleration of baryons, first suggested by Waxman\n(1995a), Vietri (1995) and Milgrom & Usov (1995).\nAccelerated protons can emit synchrotron radiation\nat this energy band (Vietri 1997b; Totani 1998a,b;\nB\u00f6tcher & Dermer 1998). High energy baryons can\nalso produce energetic pions, via photo-meson interactions with the low energy photons, creating an alternative source of high energy photons and neutrinos\n(Waxman & Bahcall 1997, 2000; B\u00f6tcher & Dermer\n1998). A high energy component may also be created\nby the decay of energetic pions, produced in protonproton(neutron) collisions, if the expanding plasma collides with a dense (n \u223c 1011 cm\u22123 ) cloud (Katz 1994;\nDe Paolis, Ingresso & Orlando 2000).\nIn this paper, we analyze the high energy emission\n\n\f2\n\nPeer & Waxman\n\ncomponent during the early afterglow (transition phase)\non a time scale of tens to hundreds of seconds following\nthe GRB, within the framework of the fireball model.\nWe explore the dependence of photon spectrum on uncertain model parameters, in particular on the energy\ndensity of the magnetic field, the power law index of\nthe accelerated particles and the density of the medium\nsurrounding the fireball. The ambient medium density\ndiffers widely between different scenarios for GRB production. In the neutron star merger scenario (Goodman\n1986; Paczy\u0144ski 1986; Eichler et al. 1989), for example,\na density typical to the ISM (n \u2248 1 cm\u22123 ) is generally\nexpected, while in the massive stellar collapse scenario\n(Woosley 1993; Levinson & Eichler 1993; Paczy\u0144ski\n1998) a much higher density (n \u2248 103 \u2212 104 cm\u22123 ) may\nbe expected in a wind surrounding the progenitor, due\nto mass loss preceding the collapse (Chevalier 2001). In\naddition, we explore the possible contribution of high energy protons.\nCalculation of the early high energy emission spectrum is complicated due to several reasons: First, IC\nscattering is partly in the Klein-Nishina regime. Second, high energy photons (produced by IC scattering\nor via pion decay) initiate high energy electro-magnetic\ncascades, the evolution of which is difficult to study\nanalytically. Studies of cascade processes in the past\n( Bonometto & Rees (1971); Guilbert, Fabian & Rees\n(1983); Svensson (1987)) have shown that it may have a\nsignificant effect on the spectrum at high energies. And\nthird, the optical depth to pair production may be large\nat high energy, leading to the formation of a large number of e\u00b1 pairs which affect the resulting spectra. Due to\nthese complications, numerical calculations are required\nto accurately determine the high energy spectra and their\ndependence on uncertain model parameters.\nNumerical methods where extensively used in the past\nin the study of active galactic nucleus (AGN) plasma\n(Guilbert, Fabian & Rees 1983; Zdziarski & Lightman\n1985; Fabian et al. 1986; Lightman & Zdziarski 1987;\nCoppi 1992). Using these methods, new results were\nobtained, such as the complex pattern of the spectral\nindices in the X-ray (2 \u2212 10 keV) range, that were not\nobtained by previous analytic calculations. In the context of the high energy emission from GRB's, numerical calculations are challenging. The large difference\nbetween the characteristic time scales for the evolution\nof high energy and low energy particles, and the fact\nthat the distribution of low energy particles evolves on\na time scale comparable to the dynamical time and\ndoes not reach a steady-state, implies that the numerical code must follow processes characterized by widely\ndiffering time scales. Due to these difficulties, the accuracy of existing numerical calculations of emission from\nGRB's (Panaitescu & M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros 1998) is limited above\n\u223c 1 GeV. Here we present numerical results using a code\nthat allows to overcome the difficulties mentioned above.\nOur time dependent model includes an accurate description of synchrotron emission, direct and inverse Compton\nscattering, pair production and the evolution of high energy electromagnetic cascades.\nSeveral new high energy photon detectors will become fully operational in the near future. These in-\n\nclude the GLAST3 satellite, which will greatly improve\nthe sensitivity at \u223c 1 GeV and will open a new window of observation up to \u223c 100 GeV. GLAST sensitivity, \u223c 10\u221213 erg cm\u22122 sec\u22121 at 1 GeV will allow detection of many hundreds of bursts per year, if GRB's emit\nequal amount of energy at GeV and keV bands. In addition, new generation of sub-TeV Cerenkov detectors such\nas MAGIC4 , HESS5 VERITAS6 and CANGAROO III7\nwill open new era in GRB observations. The universe is\ntransparent to 100 GeV photons up to redshift of \u2248 0.5\n(e.g. Salamon & Stecker 1998). Given the local rate of\nGRBs (Guetta, Piran & Waxman 2003), the sensitivity\nof these detectors at \u223c 100 GeV, \u223c 10\u221210 erg cm\u22122 sec\u22121\nfor a 100 second burst, will allow a detection of few to few\ntens of GRB's per year at this energy band (depending on\nthe exact instrument energy threshold) if the GRB spectrum in the keV - sub TeV range is flat, \u03bdF\u03bd \u221d \u03bd 0 . The\nfield of view of the Cerenkov telescopes is small, which\nimplies that fast slewing to the GRB position, on minute\ntime scale, would be required. This may be achievable\nwith the fast alerts that will be provided by SWIFT8 .\nThe sensitivity of the MILAGRO9 shower detector at\n\u223c 1 TeV would allow it to detect \u223c 1 event per year.\nThe results presented here may therefore be useful for\nplanning the observing strategy of the detectors and may\nallow to use high energy data to constrain the values of\nuncertain parameters of the model.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In \u00a72 we derive the\nplasma conditions during the transition phase, which is\nthe duration over which the reverse shock exists. We\ncalculate the critical synchrotron frequencies and luminosities in the \"wind\" scenario (\u00a72.1) and in the \"uniform\ndensity ISM\" scenario (\u00a72.2). In \u00a72.3 we discuss proton\nenergy loss and its contribution to high energy photon\nemission. Our numerical model is briefly presented in\n\u00a73; A detailed description of the model may be found\nin Pe'er & Waxman (2004). In \u00a74 we present our numerical results.

As the reverse shock crosses\nthe ejecta, it erases the memory of the initial conditions,\nand the expansion then approaches the Blandford-McKee\nself-similar solutions (Blandford & McKee 1976). We\nderive in this section the plasma parameters, the low energy photon luminosity and spectrum, and the proton\nenergy loss time scales expected during this transition\nphase, for fireball expanding into a wind and into a uniform medium with density typical to the ISM.\n2.1.

During the self similar expansion, the\nLorentz factor of plasma behind the forward shock is\n\u0393BM = (9E/16\u03c0\u01eb(r))1/2 r\u22123/2 , where \u01eb(r) is the energy\ndensity of the surrounding medium, \u01eb(r) \u2248 \u03c1(r)c2 , and\nE is the (isotropically equivalent) fireball energy. The\ncharacteristic time at which radiation emitted by shocked\nplasma at radius r is observed by a distant observer is\nt \u2248 r/4\u03932BM c (Waxman 1997c).\nThe reverse shock is relativistic if the energy density\nof the surrounding matter swept by the forward shock\nequals the energy density of the propagating plasma.\nSince both energy densities decrease with the second\npower of the radius, a relativistic shock is formed if\nE/(4\u03c0r2 \u03932i cT ) \u2264 4\u03932i \u01eb(r), i.e. if\nE \u2264 16\u03c0r2 \u03934i cT \u01eb(r) = 5.5 \u00d7 1056 A\u2217 T2 \u03934i,2.5 erg,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u0393i = 102.5 \u0393i,2.5 is the original ejecta Lorentz factor, and T = 100 T2 s is the burst duration.

Proton energy loss and its contribution to high\n\nenergy photon emission\nProtons accelerated to high energy in the reverse shock\ncontribute to the emission of high energy photons by synchrotron emission and photo-production of pions, which\ndecay to produce high energy photons and electrons (and\nneutrinos).

(17), (18) and (21) we find that proton\nacceleration is limited by energy losses, and that pion\nproduction losses dominates over synchrotron losses for\n\u01ebe & \u01ebB /10.\n(22)\nNote, that this is valid independent of the proton energy, since t\u03c0 \u221d tsyn \u221d \u03b3p\u22121 . X-ray afterglow observations suggest that \u01ebe is close to equipartition, \u01ebe \u223c 1/3\n(Freedman & Waxman 2001; Berger, Kulkarni & Frail\n2003). Thus, we expect proton energy losses to be dominated by pion production. Comparing eqs. (17) and (21)\nwe find that for \u01ebe \u223c 0.1 the highest energy protons lose\nall their energy to pion production. Assuming a power\nlaw distribution of proton energies, dnp /d\u03b3p \u221d \u03b3p\u22122 ,\nroughly 0.1 of the energy carried by protons will be converted in this case to pions, and roughly half of this energy would be converted to high energy photons through\nthe decay to photons and electrons (positrons). Since\nshock accelerated electrons lose all their energy to radiation, this implies that the contribution of protons to the\nluminosity is similar to that of the electrons. This is valid\nalso for values of \u01ebe well below equipartition, \u01ebe \u226a 0.1,\nsince the contribution to the luminosity of both electrons\nand protons is \u221d \u01ebe\u22121 in this case.\nIn the case that eq. (22) is not satisfied, and the proton\nenergy loss is dominated by synchrotron losses, comparing eqs. (17) and (18) implies that the highest energy\nprotons lose all their energy to synchrotron losses if the\nmagnetic field is close to equipartition. For lower values\n3/2\nof \u01ebB , the highest energy protons lose a fraction \u223c \u01ebB of\ntheir energy by synchrotron emission. In this case, proton synchrotron emission would dominate the electron\n3/2\nluminosity if \u01ebB > 10\u01ebe .\nFor explosion into a uniform density ISM, similar arguments imply that pion production losses dominate over\nsynchrotron losses when eq. (22) is satisfied. Following the analysis of Waxman & Bahcall (2000), protons\nwhich are expected to be accelerated up to \u03b3p,dyn \u2248\n1/4 1/4 1/4 1/2\n5 \u00d7 109 E53 n0 T2 \u01ebB,\u22121 , lose a fraction f\u03c0 (\u03b3p ) \u2248\n3/8 5/8\n\n\u22121/8\n\n2 \u00d7 10\u221211 \u03b3p E53 n0 T2\n\u01ebe,\u22121 of their energy to pion\nproduction. Therefore, for a power law index p = 2\nof the accelerated protons, pions receive a fraction \u2243\n5/8 7/8 1/8\n1/2\n10\u22123 E53 n0 T2 \u01ebe,\u22121 \u01ebB,\u22121 of the total proton energy.\nSince in this scenario as well electrons lose almost all their\nenergy to radiation, the total proton contribution to the\nphoton flux is \u2248 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 of the electron contribution,\nindependent on the value of \u01ebe . If eq. (22) is not satisfied, proton synchrotron losses dominate over pion production. A similar calculation to the former case shows\nthat proton synchrotron emission dominates the electron\n3/2\nluminosity in this scenario only if \u01ebB > 104 \u01ebe .\nThe discussion presented above demonstrates that the\nenergy loss of protons is expected to be dominated by\n\n\fHigh energy emission\npion production, and that this energy loss may produce a\nluminosity similar to that of the electrons in the scenario\nof explosion into a wind. Finally, it should be pointed\nout that if protons are accelerated to a power-law energy\ndistribution with an index p significantly larger than 2,\ntheir contribution to the luminosity will be significantly\nreduced, since the fraction of energy carried by the highest energy protons will be small.\n3. THE NUMERICAL MODEL\n\nThe acceleration of particles in the two shock waves\nthat exist during the transition phase is accompanied\nby numerous radiative processes. In the numerical calculations, we use the time dependent numerical model\ndescribed in Pe'er & Waxman (2004). Our time dependent model follows the evolution of the particle distribution and the emergent spectra, by solving the kinetic\nequations for the electron and photon distributions, taking into account synchrotron emission, inverse Compton\nscattering, pair production and pion photo-production\ninteractions. These calculations are done for a wide\nrange of particle energies, including the evolution of rapid\nelectro-magnetic cascades at high energies.\nIn the calculations, we focus on particles that pass\nthrough the forward or the reverse shock waves and\ntherefore are in the downstream region of the flow, relative to the relevant shock wave. While the upstream relativistic flow is highly anisotropic, the shocked gas thermalize, hence isotropise (in the plasma comoving frame)\nimmediately after passing the shock, on a characteristic\nlength scale of several skin-depth (e.g., Kirk et al. 1998,\n2000; Frederiksen et al. 2004). The emitted radiation is\ntherefore isotropic in the comoving frame. Most of the\nshocked gas and most of the blast-wave energy are concentrated in a shell of co-moving thickness \u2206r = \u03b6cTdyn\nwith \u03b6 . 1 (e.g., in the Blandford & McKee (1976) selfsimilar solutions which give the spatial dependence of\nthe hydrodynamical variables, 90% of the energy is concentrated in a shell of co-moving thickness corresponding to \u03b6 = 1/7). Since the details of the spatial dependence of the electron and magnetic field energy fractions\nare not known, we adopt in our model the commonly\nused approximation (e.g., Lightman & Zdziarski 1987;\nCoppi 1992; Pilla & Loeb 1998) that radiation is produced within a homogeneous shell of comoving width\n\u2206r = \u03b6cTdyn with \u03b6 = 1. Since the shocks velocity is\ntime independent during Tdyn , the shock-heated comoving plasma volume is assumed to increase linearly with\ntime, i.e., constant particle number density is assumed\n(see Pe'er & Waxman 2004, for further details).\nIn the comoving frame, homogeneous and isotropic distributions of both particles and photons are therefore assumed. Parallel calculations of processes in the two shock\nwaves are carried out, where photons produced at each\nshock participate in IC scattering, photo-production interactions and pair production interactions occurring at\nboth shocks.\nThe particle distributions are discretized, the proton\nspectrum spans 11 decades of energy (\u03b3p < 1011 ), and\nthe electron spectrum 14 decades (\u03b3e < 1014 ). A fixed\ntime step is chosen, typically 10\u22124 times the dynamical\ntime. Numerical integration is carried out with this fixed\ntime step. Particles and photons for which the energy\nloss time or annihilation time are shorter than the fixed\n\n5\n\ntime step, are assumed to lose all their energy in a single\ntime step, producing secondaries which are treated as a\nsource of lower energy particles. Photo-pion production\nis calculated at each time step by direct integration of\nthe second integral in Eq. 19, while approximating the\nfirst integral by the contribution from the \u2206-resonance\n(see the discussion following Eq. 20). Half of the energy\nlost by protons goes into \u03c0 0 that decays into 2 photons,\neach carrying 10% of the initial proton energy.\nThe following approximations are made: (i) Plasma\nparameters are assumed to be time independent during\nthe transition phase; (ii) The fraction of thermal energy\nthat is carried by electrons (magnetic field), \u01ebe (\u01ebB ), is\nthe same at the forward and reverse shock waves; (iii)\nThe power law index of the energy distribution of accelerated electrons and protons is the same at both shocks.\nIn the present calculations, we do not consider proton\nsynchrotron emission, which is dominated by pion production for the considered parameter range. Synchrotron\nself absorption is also not considered here, being irrelevant for processes occurring at high energies. Photons\nbelow the self absorption frequency, \u03b5ob.\nssa \u2264 1 eV (in both\nscenarios; see eqs. 8, 13) can produce pairs only with\n16\nphotons energetic than \u03932 (me c2 )2 /\u03b5ob.\nssa \u2243 10 eV, which\nare absent (see the numerical results below).

High vs. low density\n\nFigure 1 shows spectra obtained from a GRB transition\nphase in the two scenarios discussed: Explosion in a uniform low density medium typical to the ISM, n = 1 cm\u22123\n, and explosion in a A\u2217 = 1 wind, where the density of\nambient medium at the transition radius is much higher,\nn \u2248 103 cm\u22123 .\nThe most evident feature of the two spectra is their\nflatness, \u03bdF\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u03b1 with \u03b1 \u2243 0, extending over seven\nob.\nenergy decades between \u03b5ob.\n\u03b3,m,f \u2243 1.4 keV and \u03b5\u03b3,max \u2243\n60 GeV for expansion into ISM, and over ten energy\nob.\ndecades from \u03b5ob.\n\u03b3,m,r \u2248 1 eV to \u03b5\u03b3,max \u2248 10 GeV for explosion into a wind. This is a result of dominant synchrotron\nemission term at these energies.\nThe main difference between the two scenarios appears\nat high energies, 100 GeV \u2212 1 TeV, due to the different\noptical depth to pair production, \u03c4\u03b3\u03b3 (\u03b5), as shown in Figure 2. The large optical depth to pair production in the\nwind case softens the high energy IC spectrum, resulting in spectral index \u03b1 = \u22121. Consequently, while in\nthe ISM case the 1 TeV flux is comparable to the flux at\n1 GeV, in the high density wind case the 1 TeV flux is\n2.5 orders of magnitude lower. A second difference between the two scenarios appears at the optical-UV band.\nIn the low density scenario, at low energies, \u03b5 . \u03b5ob.\n\u03b3,m,f ,\nemission from both shock waves produces a moderate increase in the spectral slope, \u03b1 \u2243 0.3 above \u03b5ob.\n\u03b3,c \u2248 20 eV.\nAs demonstrated in Figure 3, this slope results from a\nflat spectrum produced at the reverse shock, \u03b1 = 0 above\n\u22122\n\u03b5ob.\neV, and forward shock emission character\u03b3,m,r \u2248 10\nized by \u03b1 = 0.5 below \u03b5ob.\n\u03b3,m,f .

The dependence of the spectrum on the fraction of thermal energy carried by the\nmagnetic field, \u01ebB , is illustrated in Figure 5. The domination of synchrotron emission implies that the values\nof \u03b5\u03b3,c and \u03b5\u03b3,m determine the spectral behavior at low\nenergies, while a flat spectrum is expected for p = 2 at\nhigher energies, up to \u03b5\u03b3,max \u2248 50 GeV. The ratio of\n1 GeV to 1 keV flux is informative about the value of \u01ebB ,\nwith large ratio (\u223c 30) implying small \u01ebB (\u2248 10\u22124 ).

This\ndiscrepancy is due to Klein-Nishina suppression of the\ncross-section at high energies. Consequently, IC scattering becomes dominant only above \u223c 50 GeV, where a flat\nspectrum is created for a power law index p = 2 of the\naccelerated electrons energy distribution. In the wind\ncase, IC scattering is more prominent due to the higher\nphoton density.\nLightcurve of the spectrum of an explosion into constant density ISM scenario is presented in Figure 4. The\nconstant injection rate of energetic electrons results in\na linear increase of the synchrotron emission component\nin time. Since the energy of photons emitted by electrons for which the synchrotron cooling time equals the\ntime t, \u03b5\u03b3,c (t) \u221d t\u22122 , the energy density in the low energy photons increases with time. Only photons with\n\u03b5ob.\n. 1 keV are in the Thompson limit for Compton\n\u03b3\nscattering, therefore the inverse Compton component increases in time, at early times. At later times, t . Tdyn ,\nwhere Tdyn = 4\u0393BM T is the dynamical time of the problem, the low energy photon density becomes high enough\nthat pair production phenomenon limits the high energy\nemission component.\nThe contribution of protons to the photon flux is negligible in the ISM case, however this contribution is 85%\nof the electrons' contribution to the flux in the wind\nscenario (see \u00a72.3). Most of this contribution results\nfrom the decay of energetic pions, initiating high energy electro-magnetic cascades. The high energy cascade results in flat (\u03b1 = 0) spectrum at the observed\nenergy range, which, for power law index of the accelerated particles p = 2 is similar to the spectrum from\ninverse Compton scattering. An additional small contribution from the decay of low energy pions results in a\nspectral slope \u03b1 = 1, contributing to the small deviation\nfrom flat spectrum shown below 1 GeV in this scenario.\nAbove the energy at which the optical depth for pair production \u03c4\u03b3\u03b3 > 1, \u223c 1 GeV, the spectrum is determined\nby the spectrum of low energy photons, thus the proton\ncontribution is hard to discriminate at these energies as\nwell.\n\nsec ]\n\n6\n\n10\n\n\u221210\n\n\u22129\n\n10\n\n\u221210\n\n10\n\n10\n\n\u221211\n\n10\n\n\u22128\n\n10\n\n\u221211\n\n0\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n10\nObs. energy [eV]\n\n10\n\n10\n\n12\n\n10\n\n14\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n10\nObs. energy [eV]\n\n10\n\n10\n\n12\n\n10\n\n14\n\n10\n\nFig. 3.- Two emission components of the observed spectra, explosion into ISM.

A second indication for\n\u01ebB \u2243 10\u22124 is a large (\u223c 30) ratio of the flux at 1 GeV to\nthe flux at 1 keV. In all cases, the spectra depend only\nweakly on the power-law index p of the accelerated electrons. The flux expected in the 1 \u2212 50 GeV energy band,\n\u03bdF\u03bd \u223c 10\u22128 \u2212 10\u22127 erg cm\u22122 sec\u22121 for z = 1 bursts, is\nwell within the detection capability of GLAST.\nThe recent detection by MILAGRITO of 1 TeV photon\nflux associated with GRB970417a (Atkins et al. 2003)\ncan be explained as due to the onset of fireball deceleration by a medium with density typical to the ISM,\nprovided that the magnetic field is well below equipartition, \u01ebB . 10\u22124 . The flux at 1 TeV is expected in this\ncase to be an order of magnitude higher than the 100 keV\n(BATSE) flux, as inferred from the MILAGRITO detection. We note, that an alternative explanation was\nsuggested for the 1 TeV flux, synchrotron emission from\nshock accelerated protons (Totani 1998a,b). This explanation requires a very low fraction of the energy to be\n\ncarried by electrons, \u01ebe \u223c 10\u22123 , and an isotropic equivalent explosion energy E \u223c 1056 erg. We find this explanation less attractive, since X-ray afterglow observations\nimply \u01ebe values near equipartition and isotropic equivalent energies in the range of \u223c 1051.5 erg to 1053.5 erg\n(Freedman & Waxman 2001; Berger, Kulkarni & Frail\n2003).\nThe energy loss of high energy protons is dominated by\nphoto-production of pions, rather than by synchrotron\nemission, for \u01ebe > \u01ebB /10. The contribution of pion decay\nto the high energy photon luminosity may be comparable\nto that of inverse-Compton emission of shock accelerated\nelectrons in the case of fireball expansion into a high density wind, and power law index p \u2243 2 of the accelerated\nparticles. However, it is difficult to distinguish in this\ncase between the electron and proton contributions since\nthe spectral shape is determined primarily by the energy\ndependence of the pair production optical depth. In the\ntwo scenarios considered, explosion into constant density\nISM and into a pre-ejected wind, if \u01ebe \u2264 10\u22125 \u221210\u22124 , proton synchrotron emission becomes the dominant emission\nmechanism.\nAlthough the MILAGRITO detection is singular, the\nnew generation of high energy sub-TeV detectors, such\nas MILAGRO, VERITAS, HEGRA, HESS, and MAGIC\nthat will become fully operational in the next few years,\nwill be sensitive enough to observe the high energy early\nafterglow emission at 100 GeV from \u223c 10 bursts per\nyear. The detection rate of higher energy, 1 TeV component is much lower, due to the large pair production\noptical depth for TeV photons originating at z > 0.3\n(e.g., Salamon & Stecker 1998). However, the predicted\n1 TeV flux implies that \u2248 1 burst per year, that arrives\nfrom low redshift z \u2264 0.3, could be detected in the 1 TeV\nband as well. Such detections will allow to constrain two\nof the uncertain parameters of the fireball model: the\nambient gas density, and the magnetic field equipartition\nfraction.\n\nThis work was supported in part by a Minerva grant\nand an ISF grant.
