In this paper we provide a geometric description of the possible poles of the Igusa local zeta function Z\u03a6 (s, f ) associated to an analytic\nmapping f = (f1 , . . . , fl ) : U (\u2286 K n ) \u2192 K l , and a locally constant function\n\u03a6, with support in U , in terms of a log-principalizaton of the K [x] \u2212ideal\nIf = (f1 , . . . , fl ).

The novelty of this notion resides in the fact that it depends on one\nNewton polyhedron, and Khovanskii's non-degeneracy notion depends on the\nNewton polyhedra of f1 , . . . , fl .

Introduction\nLet K be a p\u2212adic field, i.e. [K : Qp ] < \u221e. Let RK be the valuation ring\nof K, PK the maximal ideal of RK , and K = RK /PK the residue field of K.\nThe cardinality of the residue field of K is denoted by q, thus K = Fq . For\nz \u2208 K, ord (z) \u2208 Z \u222a {+\u221e} denotes the valuation of z, and |z|K = q \u2212ord(z)\nits absolute value. The absolute value |*|K can be extended to K l by defining\nkzkK = max1\u2264i\u2264l |zi |K , for z = (z1 , . . . , zl ) \u2208 K l .\nLet f1 , . . . , fl be polynomials in K [x1 , . . . , xn ], or, more generally, K\u2212analytic\nfunctions on an open set U \u2282 K n . We consider the mapping f = (f1 , . . . , fl ) :\nK n \u2192 K l , respectively, U \u2192 K l . Let \u03a6 : K n \u2192 C be a Schwartz-Bruhat function\n(with support in U in the second case).

A. ZUNIGA-GALINDO\n\nthe above data is defined as\nZ\u03a6 (s, f ) = Z\u03a6 (s, f , K) =\n\nZ\n\ns\n\n\u03a6 (x) kf (x)kK | dx |,\n\nKn\n\nfor s \u2208 C with Re(s) > 0, where | dx | is the Haar measure on K n normalized in\nn\nsuch a way that RK\nhas measure 1. We write Z(s, f ), Z0 (s, f ) and ZW (s, f ) when\nn\nn\n\u03a6 is the characteristic function of RK\n, PK\n, and an open compact subset W of K n ,\nrespectively.\nThe function Z\u03a6 (s, f ) admits a meromorphic continuation to the complex plane\nas a rational function of q \u2212s . Igusa established this result in the hypersurface case\nusing Hironaka's resolution theorem [16, Theorem 8.2.1]. In the case l \u2265 1 the\nrationality of Z\u03a6 (s, f ) was established by Meuser in [24], however, as mentioned\nin the review MR 83g:12015 of [24], a trick by Serre allows to deduce the general\ncase from the hypersurface case. Denef gave a completely different proof of the\nrationality of Z\u03a6 (s, f ), l \u2265 1, using p-adic cell decomposition [4]. The mentioned\nresults do not give any information about the poles of Z\u03a6 (s, f ) in the case l > 1. In\n[37] the second author showed that a list of possible poles of Z\u03a6 (s, f ), l \u2265 1, can be\ncomputed from an embedded resolution of singularities of the divisor \u222ali=1 fi\u22121 (0)\nby using toroidal geometry. In the special case in which f is a non-degenerate\nhomogeneous polynomial mapping the possible poles of Z\u03a6 (s, f ) are given in [38].\nIn this paper we provide a geometric description of the possible poles of Z\u03a6 (s, f ),\nl \u2265 1, in terms of a log-principalization of the K [x] \u2212ideal If = (f1 , . . . , fl ) (see\nTheorem 2.4). At this point it is important to mention that the main result in [37]\ngives an algorithm to compute a list of possible poles of Z\u03a6 (s, f ), l \u2265 1, in terms of\nan embedded resolution of singularities of the divisor \u222ali=1 fi\u22121 (0), while Theorem\n2.4 gives a list of candidates to poles in terms of a log-principalization of the ideal\nIf . Typically our new method provides a much shorter list of possible poles (see\nExample 2.5). It is important to mention that in the case l = 1 the problem of\ndetermining the poles of the meromorphic continuation of Z\u03a6 (s, f ) in Re(s) < 0\nhas been studied extensively (see e.g. [3], [14], [28], [23], [32], [34]). The relevance\nof this problem is due to the existence of several conjectures relating the poles of\nZ\u03a6 (s, f ) with the structure of the singular locus of f . In the case of polynomials in\ntwo variables, as a consequence of the works of Igusa, Strauss, Meuser and the first\nauthor, there is a complete solution of this problem [14], [27], [23], [33]. For general\npolynomials the problem of determination of the poles of Z\u03a6 (s, f ) is still open.\nThere exists a generic class of polynomials named non-degenerate with respect to\nits Newton polyhedron for which it is possible to give a small set of candidates\nfor the poles of Z\u03a6 (s, f ). The poles of the local zeta functions attached to nondegenerate polynomials can be described in terms of Newton polyhedra. The case of\ntwo variables was studied by Lichtin and Meuser [21]. In [5], Denef gave a procedure\nbased on monomial changes of variables to determine a small set of candidates for\nthe poles of Z\u03a6 (s, f ) in terms of the Newton polyhedron of f . This result was\nobtained by the second author, using an approach based on the p\u2212adic stationary\nphase formula and N\u00e9ron p\u2212desingularization, for polynomials with coefficients in\na non-archimedean local field of arbitrary characteristic [36], (see also [7], [29]).\nIn the case l = 1, among the conjectures relating the poles of Igusa's zeta function\nwith topology and singularity theory, we mention here a conjecture of Igusa that\nproposes that the real parts of the poles of the Igusa zeta function of f are roots\n\n\fZETA FUNCTIONS AND NEWTON POLYHEDRA\n\n3\n\nof the Bernstein polynomial of f (see e.g. [3], [16], and references therein). It\nseems reasonable to believe that such relations between poles and singularity theory\nextend to the case l > 1. Indeed, recently it was proved that the above-mentioned\nconjecture of Igusa is valid in the case in which If is a monomial ideal [13].\nIn the case l = 1, the largest real part of the poles of the Igusa zeta function has\nbeen extensively studied both in the archimedean and non-archimedean cases [7],\n[21], [31], [36]. In the case l \u2265 1 we show that the largest real part \u2212\u03bb (If ) of the\npoles of the Igusa zeta function attached to f can easily be determined from a logprincipalization of the ideal If (see Theorem 2.7). As a consequence of this result\nwe obtain an asymptotic estimation for the number of solutions of an arbitrary\nsystem of polynomial congruences in terms of the log-canonical threshold of a logprincipalization (see Corollary 2.9, and the comments that follow). At this point\nwe have to mention that in the case l = 1 Loeser found lower and upper bounds for\n\u03bb (If ) in terms of certain geometric invariants introduced by Teissier [22, Theorem\n2.6 and Proposition 3.1.1], [30]. In this form he derived a geometric bound for the\nnumber of solutions of a polynomial congruence involving one polynomial.\nIf f is a polynomial mapping with coefficients in a number field F , then for every\nmaximal ideal P of the ring of algebraic integers of F , we can consider Z(s, f , K),\nl \u2265 1, where K is the completion of F with respect to P . We give an explicit\nformula for Z(s, f , K), l \u2265 1, that is valid for almost all P (see Theorem 2.10).\nThe proof of this formula follows by adapting the argument given by Denef for the\ncase l = 1 [6].\nOne can also associate to a sheaf of ideals I on a smooth algebraic variety (over a\nfield of characteristic zero) a motivic zeta function (see Definition 2.16). By using\na log-principalization of I we give a similar explicit formula for it (see Theorem\n2.17). The proof is a reasonably straightforward generalization of the one given by\nDenef and Loeser in [8]. By specializing to Euler characteristics one obtains the\ntopological zeta function associated to I.\nWe attach to an analytic mapping f = (f1 , . . . , fl ) a Newton polyhedron \u0393 (f )\nand a new notion of non-degeneracy with respect to \u0393 (f ). The novelty of this\nnotion resides in the fact that it depends on one Newton polyhedron, and Khovanskii's non-degeneracy notion depends on the Newton polyhedra of f1 , . . . , fl (see\n[18], [26]). By constructing a log-principalization, we give an explicit list for the\npossible poles of Z\u03a6 (s, f ), l \u2265 1, in the case in which f is non degenerate with\nrespect to \u0393 (f ) (see Theorem 3.11). This theorem provides a generalization to the\ncase l \u2265 1 of a well-known result that describes the poles of the local zeta function\nassociated to a non-degenerate polynomial in terms of the corresponding Newton\npolyhedron [5], [21], [36]. This result was originally established by Varchenko [31]\nfor local zeta functions over R. If f is non-degenerate with respect to \u0393 (f ), then\n\u03bb (If ) can be computed from \u0393 (f ) in the classical way (see Corollary 3.12).\nBy using our notion of non-degeneracy and toroidal geometry we give an explicit\nformula for Z(s, f ) and Z0 (s, f ), l \u2265 1. This formula generalizes one given by\nDenef and Hoornaert in the case l = 1 [7, Theorem 4.2], and one given by the\nsecond author for the local zeta function of a monomial mapping [36, Theorem\n6.1].\nThe authors wish to thank the referee for his/her constructive remarks about the\npaper.

Recall that ZU (s, f ) = U kf (x)kK |dx|. The following lemma is known\nby the experts, however we did not find a suitable reference for it; for the sake of\ncompleteness we include its proof here.\nLemma 2.6. (1) ZU (s, f ) has no pole in s, i.e. ZU (s, f ) is a Laurent polynomial\nin q \u2212s if and only if there is no x \u2208 U such that f1 (x) = . . . = fl (x) = 0.\n(2) If 0 \u2208 U and f (0) = 0, i.e. f1 (0) = . . . = fl (0) = 0, then ZU (s, f ) has at least\none pole in s.\nProof. (1) We first note that rationality of ZU (s, f ) implies the equivalence of the\nconditions \"ZU (s, f ) has no pole in s\" and \"ZU (s, f ) is a Laurent polynomial in\nq \u2212s .\"\n(\u21d0) Since f : U \u2212\u2192 K l is continuous, also kf kK : U \u2212\u2192 q Z \u222a {0} is continuous. If\n0 does not belong to the image of kf kKR, then there are only finitely many values\ns\nin the image because U is compact.

Motivic and topological zeta functions. The analogue of the original explicit formula of Denef plays an important role in the study of the motivic zeta\nfunction associated to one regular function [8]. One can associate more generally\na motivic zeta function to any sheaf of ideals on a smooth variety, and obtain a\nsimilar formula for it in terms of a log-principalization using the argument of [8].\nWe just formulate the more general definition and formula, referring to e.g. [9],\n[32] for the notion of jets and Grothendieck ring.\nDefinition 2.16. Let Y be a smooth algebraic variety of dimension n over over a\nfield F of characteristic zero, and I a sheaf of ideals on Y . Let W be a subvariety\nof Y . Denote for i \u2208 N by Xi,W the variety of i\u2212jets \u03b3 on Y with origin in W for\nwhich ordt (\u03b3 \u2217 I) = i. The motivic zeta function associated to I (and W ) is the\nformal power series\n\u0001i\nP\n[Xi,W ] L\u2212n T ,\nZW (I, T ) =\ni\u22650\n\nwhere [*] denotes \u0002the \u0003class of a variety in the Grothendieck ring of algebraic varieties\nover F , and L = A1 .\nTheorem 2.17. Let \u03c3 : X \u2192 Y be a log-principalization of I. With the analogous\nnotation Ei , Ni , vi , (i \u2208 T ) as before, and also EI\u25e6 := (\u2229i\u2208I Ei ) \\ (\u222ak\u2208I\n/ Ek ) for\nI \u2282 T , we have\nZW (I, T ) =\n\n\u0003 Q (L \u2212 1) T Ni\nP \u0002 \u25e6\n.\nEI \u2229 \u03c3 \u22121 W\nNi\nvi\nI\u2282T\ni\u2208I L \u2212 T\n\nIn particular ZW (I, T ) is rational in T .\n\nSpecializing to topological Euler characteristics, denoted by \u03c7 (*), as in [8, (2.3)]\nor [32, (6.6)] we obtain the expression\n\u0001Q\nP\n1\n\u03c7 EI\u25e6 \u2229 \u03c3 \u22121 W\nZtop,W (I, s) :=\n\u2208 Q(s),\nv\n+\nNi s\ni\u2208I i\nI\u2282T\n\nwhich is then independent of the chosen log-principalization. (When the base field\nis not the complex numbers, we consider \u03c7(*) in \u00e9tale Q- cohomology as in [8].) It\ncan be taken as a definition for the topological zeta function associated to I (and\nW ), generalizing the original one of Denef and Loeser associated to one polynomial\n[10].\n3. Newton polyhedra and non-degeneracy conditions\n3.1. Newton polyhedra. We set R+ := {x \u2208 R | x > 0}.\nLet G be a nonempty subset of Nn . The Newton polyhedron \u0393\u0001 = \u0393 (G) associated to G is the convex hull in Rn+ of the set \u222am\u2208G m + Rn+ . For\nPinstance\nclassically one associates a Newton polyhedron (at the origin) to g(x) = m cm xm\n(x = (x1 , . . . , xn ), g(0) = 0), being a nonconstant polynomial function over K\nor K\u2212analytic function in a neighborhood of the origin, where G =supp(g) :=\n{m \u2208 Nn | cm 6= 0}. Further we will associate more generally a Newton polyhedron\nto an analytic mapping.\nWe fix a Newton polyhedron \u0393 as above. We first collect some notions and\nresults about Newton polyhedra that will be used in the next sections. Let h*, *i\n\n\f12\n\nWILLEM VEYS AND W. A. ZUNIGA-GALINDO\n\ndenote the usual inner product of Rn , and identify the dual space of Rn with Rn\nitself by means of it.\nFor a \u2208 Rn+ , we define\nd(a, \u0393) = d(a) = min ha, xi ,\nx\u2208\u0393\n\nand the first meet locus F (a) of a as\nF (a) := {x \u2208 \u0393 | ha, xi = d(a)}.\nThe first meet locus is a face of \u0393. Moreover, if a 6= 0, F (a) is a proper face of \u0393.\nWe define an equivalence relation in Rn+ by taking a \u223c a\u2032 \u21d4 F (a) = F (a\u2032 ). The\nequivalence classes of \u223c are sets of the form\n\u2206\u03c4 = {a \u2208 Rn+ | F (a) = \u03c4 },\nwhere \u03c4 is a face of \u0393.\nWe recall that the cone strictly spanned by the vectors a1 , . . . , ar \u2208 Rn+ \\{0} is the\nset \u2206 = {\u03bb1 a1 + ... + \u03bbr ar | \u03bbi \u2208 R+ , \u03bbi > 0}. If a1 , . . . , ar are linearly independent\nover R, \u2206 is called a simplicial cone. If a1 , . . . , ar \u2208 Zn , we say \u2206 is a rational\ncone. If {a1 , . . . , ar } is a subset of a basis of the Z-module Zn , we call \u2206 a simple\ncone.\nA precise description of the geometry of the equivalence classes modulo \u223c is as\nfollows. Each facet (i.e. a face of codimension one) \u03b3 of \u0393 has a unique vector\na(\u03b3) = (a\u03b3,1 , . . . , a\u03b3,n ) \u2208 Nn \\ {0}, whose nonzero coordinates are relatively prime,\nwhich is perpendicular to \u03b3. We denote by D(\u0393) the set of such vectors. The\nequivalence classes are rational cones of the form\n\u2206\u03c4 = {\n\nr\nX\ni=1\n\n\u03bbi a(\u03b3 i ) | \u03bbi \u2208 R+ , \u03bbi > 0},\n\nwhere \u03c4 runs through the set of faces of \u0393, and \u03b3 i , i = 1, . . . , r are the facets\ncontaining \u03c4 . We note that \u2206\u03c4 = {0} if and only if \u03c4 = \u0393. The family {\u2206\u03c4 }\u03c4 ,\nwith \u03c4 running over the proper faces of \u0393, is a partition of Rn+ \\{0}; we call this\n\b\npartition a polyhedral subdivision of Rn+ subordinated to \u0393. We call \u2206\u03c4 \u03c4 , the\nfamily formed by the topological closures of the \u2206\u03c4 , a fan subordinated to \u0393.\nEach cone \u2206\u03c4 can be partitioned into a finite number of simplicial cones \u2206\u03c4 ,i .\nIn addition, the subdivision can be chosen such that each \u2206\u03c4 ,i is spanned by part\nof D(\u0393) . Thus from the above considerations we have the following partition of\nRn+ \\{0}:\n(3.1)\n\nRn+ \\{0} =\n\n[\n\u03c4\n\nl\u03c4\n[\n\ni=1\n\n\u2206\u03c4 ,i\n\n!\n\n,\n\nwhere \u03c4 runs over the proper faces of \u0393, and each \u2206\u03c4 ,i is a simplicial cone\ncontained in \u2206\u03c4 . We will say that\n\b {\u2206\u03c4 ,i } is a simplicial polyhedral subdivision of\nRn+ subordinated to \u0393; and that \u2206\u03c4 ,i is a simplicial fan subordinated to \u0393.\nBy adding new rays , each simplicial cone can be partitioned further into a finite\nnumber of simple cones. In this way we obtain a simple polyhedral subdivision of\nRn+ subordinated to \u0393; and a simple fan subordinated to \u0393 (see e.g. [17]).\n\n\fZETA FUNCTIONS AND NEWTON POLYHEDRA\n\n13\n\n3.2. The Newton polyhedron associated to an analytic mapping. Let f =\n(f1 , . . . , fl ), f (0) = 0, be a nonconstant polynomial mapping, or more generally,\nan analytic mapping defined on a neighborhood U \u2286 K n of the origin.\u0001 In this\npaper we associate to f a Newton polyhedron \u0393 (f ) := \u0393 \u222ali=1 supp (fi ) , and a\nnon-degeneracy\nP condition to f and \u0393 (f ).\nIf fi (x) = m cm,i xm , and \u03c4 is a face of \u0393 (f ), we set\nP\ncm,i xm .\nfi,\u03c4 (x) :=\nm\u2208supp(fi )\u2229\u03c4\n\nDefinition 3.1. (1) Let f = (f1 , . . . , fl ) : U \u2212\u2192 K l be a nonconstant analytic\nmapping satisfying f (0) = 0.

The mapping f is called strongly non-degenerate with\nrespect to \u0393(f ), if for any face \u03c4 \u2282 \u0393(f ), including \u0393(f ) itself, and\nanyi\nh\n\b\n\u2202fi,\u03c4\n\u00d7 n\nz \u2208 z \u2208 (K ) | f1,\u03c4 (z) = . . . = fl,\u03c4 (z) = 0\nit verifies that rankK \u2202xj (z)\n= min{l, n}.\n\nRemark 3.2. Let f = (f1 , . . . , fl ) : U \u2212\u2192 K l be a nonconstant analytic mapping\nsatisfying f (0) = 0.\n(1) Let \u03b3 be a face of \u0393(f ) for which the rank condition in Definition 3.1 is satisfied.\nIf supp(fi ) \u2229 \u03b3 6= \u2205 \u21d4 i \u2208 I\u03b3 for a non-empty subset I\u03b3 \u2286 {1, . . . , l} satisfying\ncard(I\u03b3 ) < min{l, n}, then necessarily\n\\ \b\n\u0001n\nz \u2208 K \u00d7 | fi,\u03b3 (z) = 0 = \u2205.\ni\u2208I\u03b3\n\n(2) If for a given face \u03b3 at least one fi,\u03b3 is a monomial, then the rank condition\non \u03b3 is satisfied. This is in particular true if \u03b3 is a point.\n\u0001\nExample 3.3. Let f (x, y) = x3 \u2212 xy, y . The mapping f is strongly nondegenerate at the origin with respect to \u0393(f ), and also strongly non-degenerate\nwith respect to \u0393(f ).\n\u0001\nExample 3.4. Let f (x, y, z) = x2 , y 2 , z 2 , xy, xz, yz . Then f is strongly nondegenerate at the origin with respect to \u0393 (f ), and also strongly non-degenerate\nwith respect to \u0393 (f ),\n\n3.2.1. Monomial mappings. Any monomial mapping is strongly non-degenerate at\nthe origin with respect to its Newton polyhedron. If f 0 is a fixed monomial mapping\nwith Newton polyhedron \u0393 (f 0 ), and f = f 0 +g is a deformation of f 0 such that all\nthe monomials in g have exponents in the interior of \u0393 (f 0 ), then f is strongly nondegenerate at the origin with respect to \u0393 (f ) = \u0393 (f 0 ). This type of mapping\nwas introduced by the second author in [37, Definition 6.1]. Furthermore, the\ncorresponding local zeta function can be computed by using a simple polyhedral\nsubdivision subordinated to \u0393 (f 0 ) [37, Theorem 6.1].\n3.2.2. Saia's non-degeneracy condition. In [28] Saia introduced the following notion of non-degeneracy for ideals. Let I = (f1 , . . . fl ) be a polynomial\n\u0001 ideal. I is\nnon-degenerate with respect to \u0393 (I) (where \u0393 (I) = \u0393 \u222ali=1 supp (fi ) ), if for every\n\n\f14\n\nWILLEM VEYS AND W. A. ZUNIGA-GALINDO\n\ncompact face \u03c4 of \u0393 (I), the system of equations f1,\u03c4 (z) = 0, . . . fl,\u03c4 (z) = 0 does\nn\nnot have a solution in the torus (K \u00d7 ) . Thus Saia's notion of non-degeneracy is\na particular case of our notion of non-degeneracy. Saia's notion of non-degeneracy\nplays an important role in the study of the integral closure of ideals.\n3.2.3. Khovanskii's non-degeneracy condition. Now we discuss the relation between our notion of non-degeneracy and Khovanskii's notion of non-degeneracy of\nan analytic mapping with respect to several Newton polyhedra ([18], see also [26]).\nGiven a positive vector a (i.e. a \u2208 (N\\ {0})n ), and an analytic mapping g, we set\nga (x) := gF (a) (x), where F (a) is the first meet locus of a with respect to \u0393 (g).\nTo make explicit the dependence between F (a) and \u0393 (g) we shall write F (a, \u0393 (g))\ninstead of F (a).\nDefinition 3.5. A nonconstant analytic mapping f = (f1 , . . . , fl ) : U \u2212\u2192 K l ,\nf (0) = 0, is non-degenerate\nwith respect to (\u0393 (f1 ) , . . . , \u0393 (fl )), if for any positive\n\b\nn\nvector a and any z \u2208 z \u2208 (K \u00d7 ) | f1,a (z) = . . . = fl,a (z) = 0 it verifies that\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u2202fi,a\nrankK\n(z) = min{l, n}.\n\u2202xj\nHere fj,a (z) = fj,F (a,\u0393(fj )) (z) for every j.\n\nThe above definition is equivalent to the non-degeneracy notion given by Oka\nin [26], that is in turn a reformulation of the notion of non-degeneracy introduced\nby Khovanskii in [18].\nRemark 3.6. Let f = (f1 , . . . , fl ) : U \u2212\u2192 K l be a nonconstant analytic mapping\nsatisfying f (0) = 0. Then \u0393 (f ) is the convex hull in (R+ )n of \u222alj=1 \u0393 (fj ). This\n\nassertion follows from the fact that for any subsets A, B \u2286 (R+ )n , A \u222a B = A \u222a B,\nn\nwhere the bar denotes the convex hull in (R+ ) .\n\nThe following is the relation between Khovanskii's non-degeneracy notion and\nthe one introduced here.\nProposition 3.7. Let f = (f1 , . . . , fl ) : U \u2212\u2192 K l be an analytic mapping strongly\nnon-degenerate at the origin with respect to \u0393(f ). Then f is non-degenerate with\nrespect to\n(\u0393 (f1 ) , . . . , \u0393 (fl )).\nn\n\nProof. Let a \u2208 (N\\ {0}) be a fixed positive vector. We set \u0393 = \u0393(f ), \u0393j = \u0393 (fj ),\nj = 1, . . . , l. Since \u0393j \u2286 \u0393 by the above remark,\nd(a, \u0393) = min ha, xi \u2264 d(a, \u0393j ) = min ha, xi ,\nx\u2208\u0393\n\nx\u2208\u0393j\n\nfor j = 1, . . . , l. We define I \u2286 {1, . . . , l} by the condition\nj \u2208 I \u21d4 d(a, \u0393) = d(a, \u0393j ).\n\nNote that I 6= \u2205.

Then the ideal \u03c3 \u2217 (If )\nis principal (and monomial) in a sufficiently small neighborhood of \u03c3 \u22121 {0}.\nProof. We first recall the construction of (YK , \u03c3 0 ) from a simple fan Ff subordinated to \u0393 (f ) (see e.g. [2]). Let \u2206\u03c4 be an n\u2212dimensional simple cone in Ff such\nthat F (a) = \u03c4 for any a \u2208 \u2206\u03c4 . Then the face \u03c4 of \u0393 (f ) is necessarily a point. Let\na1 , . . . , an be the generators of \u2206\u03c4 . Then in the chart of YK corresponding to \u2206\u03c4 ,\nthe map \u03c3 0 has the form\n\u03c30 : K n\ny\n\n(3.3)\nwhere xi =\n\nY\n\nj\n\n\u2212\u2192 U\n\u2212\u2192 x,\n\na\n\nyj i,j , with [ai,j ] = [a1 , . . . , an ]. Denote this chart by V\u03c4 . We\n\nslightly abuse notation here : since \u03c3 0 only maps to U instead of to the\nP whole of\nK n , at some charts it will not be defined everywhere on K n .

We will study simultaneously points with exactly r zero coordinates (where\n1 \u2264 r \u2264 n \u2212 1); after permuting indices, we may assume that the first r coordinates\nare zero.\nLet \u03c4 \u2032 be the first meet locus of the cone \u2206\u03c4 \u2032 spanned by a1 , . . . , ar ; it is a\ncompact face of \u0393 (f ) (cf.

The first case occurs when there exists an index i\nQr\nd(a )\nsuch that fei (e\np) 6= 0.

The case of tf < 1 is more difficult and is\nestablished in [7] with some additional conditions on \u0393 (f ) by using a difficult\nresult on exponential sums.

But then\nin general we have to introduce new rays which give rise to superfluous candidate\npoles.\n\u0001\nExample 4.3. Let f = x3 \u2212 xy, y as in Example 2.14. It is strongly nondegenerate over K with respect to \u0393(f ). We shall compute Z(s, f ) using Theorem\n4.2 and the obvious rational simplicial polyhedral subdivision of R2+ . More precisely, set a1 = (0,\n\b 1), a2 = (1, 3), and a3 = (1, 0); \u2206i = {ai \u03bb | \u03bb > 0} for i = 1, 2,\n3, and \u2206i,i+1 = \u03bbai + \u03bb\u2032 ai+1 | \u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 > 0 , i = 1, 2. Then\nR2+ = {0} \u222a \u22061 \u222a \u22061,2 \u222a \u22062 \u222a \u22062,3 \u222a \u22063 .\n\nWith the notation of Theorem 4.2 one easily verifies that all D\u03c4 = \u2205 and hence\nall L\u03c4 = q \u22122 (q \u2212 1)2 . Further\nS\u03c4 1 = S\u03c4 3 =\nS\u03c4 1,2\nTherefore\n\nq \u22124\u22123s\nq \u22121\n, S\u03c4 2 =\n,\n\u22121\n1\u2212q\n1 \u2212 q \u22124\u22123s\n\n\u0001\n1 + q 2+s + q 3+2s q \u22125\u22123s\nq \u22125\u22123s\n=\n, S\u03c4 2,3 =\n.\n(1 \u2212 q \u22121 ) (1 \u2212 q \u22124\u22123s )\n(1 \u2212 q \u22121 ) (1 \u2212 q \u22124\u22123s )\n\n\u0001\nq + 1 + q \u22121\u2212s + q \u22122\u22122s\n.\nZ(s, f ) = q (q \u2212 1)\n1 \u2212 q \u22124\u22123s\nIf we would use the natural simple polyhedral subdivision of the one above, introducing two new rays generated by (1, 1) and (1, 2), we would introduce the same\nsuperfluous (real) candidate poles \u22122 and \u2212 23 as in Example 2.14. This is reasonable because the log-principalization of Proposition 3.9 associated to this simple\nfan is in fact the same as the one constructed in Example 2.14.\n\u22122\n\n\fZETA FUNCTIONS AND NEWTON POLYHEDRA\n\n21\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\nExample 4.4. Let f = y 2 \u2212 x3 , y 2 \u2212 z 2 as in Example 2.15. When char K 6=\n2, it is strongly non-degenerate at the origin over K with respect to \u0393(f ). The\nNewton polyhedron \u0393(f ) has seven compact faces. The polyhedral subdivision associated to it is already simplicial, so in the formulation of Theorem 4.2 (2) we need\nto sum over seven cones: the ray through a = (2, 3, 3), the three 2\u2212dimensional\ncones with a in their boundaries, and the three 3\u2212dimensional cones. We note\nthat all \u0001the D\u03c4 = \u2205, except when \u03c4 is the unique compact facet, in this case\ncard D\u03c4 = 2 (q \u2212 1). Concerning the S\u03c4 (q \u2212s ) we just mention that the expresP\nsion h q \u03c3(h)+d(h)s is three times equal to 1, three times equal to 1 + q 3+2s + q 6+4s ,\nand once to 1 + q 5+3s . One can verify that the formula in Theorem 4.2 yields the\nsame expression for Z0 (s, f ) as in Example 2.15. Note that \u22128/6 and \u22122 are the\nonly (real) candidate poles given by Theorems 3.11 or 4.2.\nRemark 4.5. With the obvious analogous definitions for strongly non-degeneracy\nover C, we have the following. Suppose that f1 , . . . fl are polynomials in n variables\nwith coefficients in a number field F (\u2286 C). Then we can consider f = (f1 , . . . , fl )\nas a map K n \u2192 K l for any non-archimedean completion K of F . If f is strongly\nnon-degenerate at the origin over C with respect to \u0393 (f ), then f is strongly nondegenerate over K with respect to \u0393 (f ) for almost all the completions K of F .\n(And analogously for non-degeneracy at the origin.) This fact follows by applying\nthe Weak Nullstellensatz.\nRemark 4.6. By using our notion of non-degeneracy with respect to a Newton\npolyhedron it is also possible to give lists of candidate poles and explicit formulae for the motivic and topological zeta functions introduced in 2.4, associated to\na polynomial ideal. These explicit formulas are reasonably straightforward generalizations of those in [1] and [10, Th\u00e9or\u00e8me 5.3 (i)]. For the topological zeta\nfunction one requires here strongly non-degeneracy with respect to all the faces of\nthe \"global\" Newton polyhedron as in [10, (5.1)].\nReferences\n[1] Artal Bartolo E., Cassou-Nogu\u00e8s P., Luengo I., and Melle Hern\u00e1ndez A., Quasi-Ordinary\npower series and their zeta functions, Mem.
