Introduction\nCoagulation and fragmentation processes occur in the dynamics of cluster growth and describe\nthe mechanisms by which clusters can coalesce to form larger clusters or fragment into smaller\nones. Models of this type have found important applications in areas ranging over polymer kinetics\n[29], aerosols [16], cluster formation in astrophysics [26] to the animal grouping in biology [27].\nThis paper is devoted to the numerical simulation of the dynamics of the density function\nf = f (t, x, y) \u2265 0 of particles (polymers, clusters) with position x \u2208 \u03a9 \u2282 RN (N \u2265 1), volume\ny \u2208 R+ := (0, \u221e), and time t \u2265 0. The distribution function f is subject to coagulation and\nfragmentation phenomena with respect to the volume variable y and diffusion in space x \u2208 \u03a9 and\nis governed by the following equation\n\u2202f\n(1)\n\u2212 d(y) \u2206x f = Q(f ),\n\u2202t\nwhere Q(f ) is the coagulation-fragmentation operator acting on the volume variable y \u2208 R+ and\nthese particles diffuse in the environment \u03a9, which is assumed to be a smooth bounded domain\nwith normalized volume |\u03a9| = 1. Moreover, the model (1) is supplemented with an initial datum\n(2)\n\nf (0, x, y) := f in (x, y),\n\nand in the following analysis we will consider homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions on \u2202\u03a9\n(3)\n\n(t, x, y) \u2208 R+ \u00d7 \u2202\u03a9 \u00d7 R+ ,\n\n\u2207x f (t, x, y) * \u03bd(x) = 0,\n\nwith \u03bd the outward unit normal to \u03a9. We also assume the diffusion coefficient d(y) to be non\ndegenerate in the sense that there exists d\u2217 , d\u2217 \u2208 R+ such that\n(4)\n\nd\u2217 \u2265 d(y) \u2265 d\u2217 > 0,\n\ny \u2208 R+ .\n\nLet us first describe precisely the coagulation and fragmentation process. In the simplest coagulationfragmentation models the clusters are usually assumed to be fully identified by their size (or volume, or number of particles). The coagulation-fragmentation models we consider in this paper\ndescribe the time evolution of the cluster size distribution as the system of clusters undergoes\n1\n\n\fbinary coagulation and binary fragmentation events. More precisely, denoting by Cy the clusters\nof size y with y \u2208 R+ , the basic reactions taken into account herein are\n(5)\n\nCy + Cy \u2032\n\nand\n\na(y, y \u2032 )\nCy+y\u2032 , (binary coagulation)\n\u2212\u2192\n\nb(y \u2212 y \u2032 , y \u2032 )\nCy\u2212y\u2032 + Cy\u2032 , (binary fragmentation),\n\u2212\u2192\nwhere a and b denote the coagulation and fragmentation rates respectively, and are assumed to\ndepend only on the size of the clusters involved in these reactions.\nThus, the coagulation-fragmentation operator is defined by\n(6)\n\nCy\n\n(7)\n\nQ(f ) = Qc (f ) \u2212 Qf (f ),\n\nwhere the coagulation operator is\nZ \u221e\nZ\n1 y\n(8) Qc (f )(x, y) =\na(y, y \u2032 ) f (x, y) f (x, y \u2032 ) dy \u2032\na(y \u2032 , y \u2212 y \u2032 ) f (x, y \u2032 ) f (x, y \u2212 y \u2032 ) dy \u2032 \u2212\n2 0\n0\n\nwhereas fragmentation mechanism by which a single particle splits into two pieces is given by\nZ \u221e\nZ\n1 y\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nb(y, y \u2032 ) f (x, y + y \u2032 ) dy \u2032 .\nb(y , y \u2212 y ) dy f (x, y) \u2212\n(9)\nQf (f )(x, y) =\n2 0\n0\n\nThe coagulation coefficient, a = a(y, y \u2032 ), characterizes the rate at which the coalescence of two\nparticles with respective volumes y and y \u2032 produces a particle of volume y + y \u2032 , whereas the\nfragmentation coefficient, b = b(y, y \u2032 ), represents the rate at which the fragmentation of one\nparticle with volume y + y \u2032 produces two particles of volume y and y \u2032 . Both coefficients a and b\nare nonnegative functions and\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 a(y, y \u2032 ) = a(y \u2032 , y), b(y, y \u2032 ) = b(y \u2032 , y),\n(10)\n\u0001\n\uf8f3\n+\n+\na, b \u2208 L\u221e\n.\nloc R \u00d7 R\n\nFor symmetric kernels, we observe that during the microscopic coagulation and fragmentation\nprocesses, as depicted in equations (5)-(6), the number of particles varies with time while the\ntotal volume of particles is conserved.\nIn terms of f , the total number of particles and the total volume of particles at time t \u2265 0 are\nrespectively given by\nZ\nZ\ny f (t, x, y) dy.\nf (t, x, y) dy, M1 (t, x) :=\nM0 (t, x) :=\nR+\n\nR+\n\nBesides existence and uniqueness results, few is known on the qualitative behavior of solutions\nof coagulation-fragmentation equations except when coagulation and fragmentation coefficients\nare linked by the so called \"detailed balanced condition\" : there exists a nonnegative function\nM \u2208 L1 (\u03a9 \u00d7 R+ , (1 + y)dxdy) such that\n\n(11)\n\na(y, y \u2032 ) M (y) M (y \u2032 ) = b(y, y \u2032 ) M (y + y \u2032 ),\n\n(x, y, y \u2032 ) \u2208 \u03a9 \u00d7 R+ \u00d7 R+ .\n\nThis condition implies that M is a stationary solution to the coagulation-fragmentation equation\nd(y) \u2206x f + Q(f ) = 0.\n2\n\n\fWe further assume that, for each R \u2208 R+ , the equilibrium M satisfies the positivity condition\n(12)\n\ninf M (y) > 0.\n\ny\u2208[0,R]\n\nAn additional and interesting feature of the detailed balanced condition is that there exists an\nentropy H given by\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u0012\nZ\nf (x, y)\n\u2212 1 + M (y) dy dx,\nH(f |M ) =\nf (x, y) ln\nM (y)\n\u03a9\u00d7R+\n\nwhich satisfies the following H theorem\n\ndH\n1\n= \u2212 D(f ) \u2212\ndt\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u03a9\u00d7R+\n\n(\u2207x f )2\n(t, x, y) dy dx \u2264 0,\nf\n\nwhere the entropy dissipation of the coagulation-fragmentation operator is defined by\nZ Z\n\u0001\n\u0001\na f f \u2032 \u2212 b f \u2032\u2032 ln(a f f \u2032 ) \u2212 ln(b f \u2032\u2032 ) dy dy \u2032 dx,\nD(f ) =\n\u03a9\n\nR+ \u00d7R+\n\nwith the shorthand notation f := f (t, x, y), f \u2032 := f (t, x, y \u2032 ) and f \u2032\u2032 := f (t, x, y + y \u2032 ). Since D(f )\nonly vanishes when f is an equilibrium, it naturally means that\nf (t) \u2212\u2192 M,\n\nwhen\n\nt \u2192 \u221e.\n\nThe main purpose of this work is to present a numerical scheme to solve (1) built upon a finite\nvolume discretization with respect to the space variable x \u2208 \u03a9 and volume variable y \u2208 R+ . The\nanalysis of the so-obtained scheme would allow to prove the convergence of the discretized particle\ndensity towards a solution to the continuous problem on a fixed time interval [0, T ] (T > 0), see for\ninstance [4], but here our aim is different. It will consist in the study of the long time behavior of\nthe numerical solution on a fixed mesh in space and volume variables. Indeed, often in applications\nwe are interested in steady states or in the long time behavior of the solution, it is then important\nto design a numerical scheme, which has good stability properties uniformly in time and remains\nconsistent with respect to the exact solution for long time. Thus, the scheme proposed in this\npaper is designed such that it preserves qualitative properties of the exact solution as steady\nstates of the coagulation-fragmentation operators (8)-(9). Moreover, an estimate of the entropy\ndissipation due to an appropriate finite volume approximation with respect to space and volume\nvariables is given and the scheme is shown to give a consistent approximation of the continuous\nproblem in the long time asymptotic limit t \u2192 \u221e.\nBefore describing more precisely our results, let us recall that the coagulation and fragmentation\nequations (1) with (8)-(9) have been the object of several studies recently.\nOn the one hand, among the various approaches for the approximation of coagulation and\nfragmentation models, we may distinguish between deterministic and Monte Carlo methods. We\nrefer for instance to [9, 12, 23] for deterministic methods, [2, 17] for stochastic methods, and the\nreferences therein. Concerning the convergence analysis of numerical methods for coagulation\nand fragmentation models, we refer to [22] for a rigorous study of quasi Monte-Carlo methods.\nFor deterministic approximations, the situation is different since the relationship between discrete\nand continuous models has been considered by some authors, see the survey paper [8] and [1].\nA rigorous setting for the formal analysis performed in [1] under general assumptions on the\ncoagulation and fragmentation coefficients has been given in [21]. Then, similar techniques are\nused to prove convergence of discrete schemes to the exact solution in [4].\n3\n\n\fHowever, few is known concerning the stability and the analysis of the numerical solution in\nthe long time asymptotic limit. For the continuous model, in reference [20], the authors are able\nto apply the techniques of weak compactness, as in the paper by R.J. DiPerna and P.-L. Lions [7]\nabout the Boltzmann equation, to prove the weak stability of weak solutions. In the case when\nan H-theorem holds, they can obtain some partial information about the large-time behavior of\nsolutions. More recently, J. A. Carrillo et al. prove exponential decay of the solution towards\nequilibrium for the inhomogeneous Aizenman-Bak model [5] using entropy dissipation methods\n[6]. Our analysis for discrete models will be inspired by these works.\nWe now briefly outline the contents of the paper. In the next section, we introduce the numerical\napproximation of (1) and state the stability result which we prove in Section 3. In the final section\n(Section 5), some numerical simulations are performed with the numerical scheme presented in\nSection 2 and the long time behavior of the solution is investigated.\n2. Numerical scheme and main results\nIn order to compute an approximation of this model using a finite volume method in space\nvariable x \u2208 \u03a9 and volume variable y \u2208 R+ , we observe that the coagulation-fragmentation\noperator can be written in a conservative form. Indeed, writing equation (1) in a \"conservative\"\nform, as proposed in [26, 28], enables to describe precisely the time evolution of the total volume.\nAlso, this formulation is particularly well adapted to a finite volume discretization which, in\nturn, is expected to give a precise account of volume conservation. Precisely, the coagulation and\nfragmentation terms can be written in divergence form:\n\uf8f1\n\u2202C(f )\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n(x, y),\ny Qc (f )(x, y) = \u2212\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u2202y\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 y Qf (f )(x, y) = \u2212 \u2202F(f ) (x, y),\n\u2202y\n\nwhere the operator C(f ) is given by\nZ yZ \u221e\nC(f )(x, y) :=\n(13)\nu a(u, v) f (x, u) f (x, v) dvdu ,\n0\n\nand F(f ) is\n(14)\n\nF(f )(x, y) :=\n\nZ\n\n(x, y) \u2208 \u03a9 \u00d7 R+ ,\n\ny\u2212u\n\ny\n0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nu b(u, v) f (x, u + v) dvdu ,\n\ny\u2212u\n\n(x, y) \u2208 \u03a9 \u00d7 R+ .\n\nFinally, the coagulation-fragmentation equation reads\n\uf8f1\n\u2202 C(f )\n\u2202 F(f )\n\u2202f\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u2212 d(y) y \u2206x f = \u2212\n+\n,\n\uf8f2 y\n\u2202t\n\u2202y\n\u2202y\n(15)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 f (0, x, y) = f in (x, y), (x, y) \u2208 \u03a9, \u00d7R+\n\nand we assume that the initial datum f in is a nonnegative function which satisfies:\n(16)\n\nf in \u2208 L1 (\u03a9 \u00d7 R+ ) \u2229 L1 (\u03a9 \u00d7 R+ , ydxdy).\n\nHere and below, the notation L1 (\u03a9 \u00d7 R+ , ydxdy) stands for the space of the Lebesgue measurable\nreal-valued functions on \u03a9 \u00d7 R+ which are integrable with respect to the measure ydxdy.\n4\n\n\fWhen designing the volume discretization of the coagulation and fragmentation terms, it is\nnecessary to truncate the infinite integrals in formulae (13)-(14). But this means restricting the\ndomain of action of kernels a and b to a bounded set of volumes y, that is, preventing coagulation\nto occur among particles with volume exceeding a fixed value. The discretization we propose is\nbased on the conservative truncation method for the coagulation and fragmentation terms. Given\na positive real R, let (x, y) \u2208 \u03a9 \u00d7 (0, R)\nZ y Z R\u2212u\nR\nC (f )(x, y) :=\nu a(u, v) f (x, u) f (x, v) dvdu ,\n0\n\n(17)\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n0\n\ny\n\nZ\n\nx\u2212u\nR\n\nu a(u, w \u2212 u) f (x, u) f (x, w \u2212 u) dw du .\n\ny\n\nIn that case, C R (f )(x, 0) = C R (f )(x, R) = 0 foreach x \u2208 \u03a9 so that the total volume of the\nsolution is now nonincreasing with respect to time.\nAs regards the fragmentation term, the truncation is also a conservative truncation on the\nfragmentation term. Using the same idea, we introduce for (x, y) \u2208 \u03a9 \u00d7 (0, R)\nZ y Z R\u2212u\nR\nu b(u, v) f (x, u + v) dv du.\nF (f )(x, y) :=\n0\n\n(18)\n\n=\n\nZ\n\ny\n\n0\n\ny\u2212u\nR\n\nZ\n\ny\n\nu b(u, w \u2212 u) f (x, w) dv du.\n\nThen, the conservative coagulation-fragmentation operator satisfies exactly the conservation of\ntotal volume, so that the following equation is indeed a truncated conservative coagulation and\nfragmentation equation:\n\uf8f1\n\u2202C R (fR )\n\u2202F R (fR )\n\u2202f\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 y R \u2212 d(y) y \u2206x fR = \u2212\n(x, y) +\n(x, y)\n\u2202t\n\u2202y\n\u2202y\n(19)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nf (0, x, y) = f in (x, y), (x, y) \u2208 \u03a9 \u00d7 (0, R),\nsince\n\nZ Z\nd R\ny fR (t, x, y) dx dy = 0.\ndt 0 \u03a9\nUnder the detailed balance condition (11), model (19) has also a steady state MR , only depending\non y and such that\nMR (y) = M (y), y \u2208 [0, R].\nand\nZ R\nZ RZ\n1\nin\nMR (y) dy.\nf (x, y) dx dy =\n|\u03a9| 0 \u03a9\n0\nConvergence for large values of R has been thoroughly studied in the recent past. We briefly\nmention some results for the coagulation equation (that is, with b = 0). These results adapt easily\nto the coagulation-fragmentation equation but under different assumptions on the kernels. Let us\nmention that when a(y, y \u2032 )/(y y \u2032 ) \u2192 0 as y + y \u2032 \u2192 +\u221e, convergence as R \u2192 +\u221e of the solutions\nto (19) toward a solution of (13)-(15) can be proven by using the approach developed in [21].\nThus, since the convergence of solutions to (19) towards solutions of (13)-(15) is well established\nin rather general situations, this paper will only focus on the convergence of a sequence built on\na numerical scheme towards a solution to the equation (19) when the truncature R is fixed. In\n5\n\n\fthe remainder of the paper, for the sake of clarity, we drop the subscript R and write f instead\nof fR for a solution of equation (19). Parameter R being fixed, this should raise no confusion.\nNow, we turn to the discretization of equation (19). Having reduced the computation to a\nbounded interval, the second step is to introduce the space and volume discretizations. To this\nend, we set \u2206y \u2208 (0, 1) and Ny a large integer, and denote by (yi\u22121/2 )i\u2208{0,...,Ny } a mesh of (0, R),\nwhere yi\u22121/2 = i \u2206y, and \u039bi = [yi\u22121/2 , yi+1/2 ) for i \u2265 0.\nConcerning the space variable, we choose an admissible mesh of \u03a9 given by a family T of control\nvolumes (open and convex polygons in 2-D), a family E of edges and a family of points (xK )K\u2208T\nwhich satisfy Definition 5.1 in [11]. It implies that the straight line between two neighboring\ncenters of cells (xK , xL ) is orthogonal to the edge \u03c3 = K|L. In the set of edges E, we distinguish\nthe interior edges \u03c3 \u2208 Eint and the boundary edges \u03c3 \u2208 Eext . For a control volume K \u2208 T , we\ndenote by EK the set of its edges, Eint,K the set of its interior edges, Eext,K the set of edges of K\nincluded in \u0393 = \u2202\u03a9.\nIn the sequel, we denote by d the distance in RN , m the measure in RN . We assume that the\nfamily of mesh considered satisfies the following regularity constraint : there exists \u03be > 0 such\nthat\n(20)\n\nd(xK , \u03c3) \u2265 \u03be d(xK , xL ),\n\nfor K \u2208 T , for \u03c3 \u2208 Eint,K , \u03c3 = K|L.\n\nThe size of the mesh is defined by\n(21)\n\n\u03b4 = max (diam(K)) .\nK\u2208T\n\nFor all \u03c3 \u2208 E, we define the transmissibility coefficient:\n\uf8f1\nm(\u03c3)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 d(xK , xL ) , for \u03c3 \u2208 Eint , \u03c3 = K|L,\n\u03c4\u03c3 =\n\uf8f4\nm(\u03c3)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n,\nfor \u03c3 \u2208 Eext,K .\n\uf8f3\nd(xK , \u03c3)\n\nNext, X(T ) will be the set of functions from \u03a9 to R which are constant over each control volume\nK \u2208T.\nWe define the approximation f h (0) of the initial datum f in as usual by\n(22)\n\nf h (0) =\n\nNy\nX\nX\n\nin\nfK,i\n1K\u00d7\u039bi ,\n\ni=0 K\u2208T\n\nwith\nin\nfK,i\n=\n\n1\nm(K) \u2206y\n\nZ\n\n\u039bi\n\nZ\n\nf in (x, y) dx dy ,\n\nK\n\nwhere 1E denotes the characteristic function of the subset E of \u03a9 and converges strongly to f 0\nin L1 (\u03a9 \u00d7 (0, R)) as h = (\u2206y, \u03b4) goes to 0.\nLet us now introduce the numerical scheme itself. For each integer i \u2208 {0, * * * , Ny } and each\nK \u2208 T , we define the approximation of f (t, x, y) for t \u2208 R+ and (x, y) \u2208 K \u00d7 \u039bi as fK,i (t).\nThe sequence (fK,i )K,i is defined by the following discretization of the coagulation-fragmentation\n6\n\n\fequation : for K \u2208 T , i \u2208 {0, . . . , Ny }, we solve the ordinary differential system\n\uf8f1\nX\ndfK,i\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u03c4\u03c3 DK,\u03c3 fK,i = m(K) QK,i ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 m(K) dt \u2212 d(yi\u22121/2 )\n\u03c3\u2208EK\n(23)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 f (0) := f in .\nK,i\nK,i\nWe have set\n(24)\n\nQK,i = \u2212\n\nCK,i+1/2 \u2212 CK,i\u22121/2 FK,i+1/2 \u2212 FK,i\u22121/2\n+\nyi\u22121/2 \u2206y\nyi\u22121/2 \u2206y\n\nwhere the flux CK,i+1/2 in (24) represents an approximation of the coagulation operator (17),\nFK,i+1/2 is the approximation of the fragmentation part (18) and both are defined by\n(25)\n\nCK,i+1/2 =\n\ny \u22121\ni NX\nX\n\n\u2206y 2 yj\u22121/2 aj,l\u2212j fK,j fK,l\u2212j ,\n\nj=0 l=i+1\n\nwhere ai,j := a(yi , yj ) with yi = (i + 1/2) \u2206y and\n(26)\n\nFK,i+1/2 =\n\ny \u22121\ni NX\nX\n\n\u2206y 2 yj\u22121/2 bj,l\u2212j fK,l ,\n\nj=0 l=i+1\n\nwhere bi,j := b(yi , yj ) whereas the fluxes at the boundary are\n(27)\n\nCK,\u22121/2 = FK,\u22121/2 = CK,Ny +1/2 = FK,Ny +1/2 = 0,\n\nK \u2208T.\n\nConcerning the approximation of the diffusion in space, we set \u03bdK,\u03c3 the unit normal to \u03c3 outward\nfrom K and define an approximation of \u2207x f * \u03bdK\u03c3 on \u03c3 by\n\u001a\nfL,i \u2212 fK,i, if \u03c3 = K|L \u2208 Eint,K ,\n(28)\nDK,\u03c3 fK,i =\n0, if \u03c3 \u2208 Eext,K ,\nfor all K \u2208 T . This discretization obviously relies on a simple finite volume approach for the\nspace and volume variables (see, e.g. [4]).\nThe following function f h defined on R+ \u00d7 \u03a9 \u00d7 [0, R] will be useful in the sequel.\nh\n\n(29)\n\nf (t, x, y) =\n\nNy\nXX\n\nfK,i (t) 1K\u00d7\u039bi .\n\nK\u2208T i=0\n\nWe may now state our main result.\nTheorem 2.1.

A priori estimates\nAs we mentioned in the introduction, our goal is not to prove that the sequence of functions\n(f h )h converges in some sense to a function f as h = (\u2206y, \u03b4) goes to 0, but to study the long\ntime behavior of the numerical solution and to prove its uniform stability with respect to time.\nFirst, we prove that the solution f h to the scheme (23)-(27) enjoys properties similar to those of\nfunction f given by (19) which we gather in Proposition 3.2 below.\nOn the one hand, we first re-write the discrete coagulation-fragmentation obtained form the\nconservative form (19) in a new form which is consistent with the classical formulation (7)-(9).\nOn the other hand, we find a discrete version of the weak formulation from which we prove a\npriori estimates.\nProposition 3.1.

Numerical simulations\nThis section is devoted to the numerical study of the convergence to equilibrium under the\ndetailed balance condition and when this condition is not satisfied. We also investigate numerically\nthe case with non homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions.\n5.1. Detailed balance kernels and convergence to equilibrium. We assume that the coagulation and fragmentation coefficients fulfil the detailed balance condition: there exists a nonnegative function M \u2208 L11 (R+ \u00d7 R+ ), such that\n\n(48)\n\na(y, y \u2032 ) M (y) M (y \u2032 ) = b(y, y \u2032 ) M (y + y \u2032 ),\n\n(y, y \u2032 ) \u2208 R+ \u00d7 R+ .\n\nSince in that case there exists a Lyapunov functional H at the discrete level, we have proven that\nthe numerical solution f h converges to a discrete equilibrium M h . Here, we choose kernels a and\nb as follows:\na(y, y \u2032 ) = b(y, y \u2032 ) = 1,\n\u221a\nwhich yields M (y) = exp(\u2212y/ M1 ). It is the Aizenman-Bak model for reacting polymers which\ndiffuse in space with a non degenerate size-dependent coefficient d(y) = \u03b1 > 0. In [5], the authors\ndemonstrate that the entropy-entropy dissipation methods developed by Desvillettes and Villani\nfor the Boltzmann equation [6] applies directly and gives the exponential convergence with explicit\nrates towards global equilibrium for constant diffusion coefficient in any spatial dimension or for\nthe non degenerate diffusion in dimension one. Thuerefore, the global equilibrium is given by\np\nM (y) = exp(\u2212y/ M1 ), y \u2208 R+ ,\nwhere the number M1 is given by\n\nM1 :=\nand M satisfies\n\n1\n|\u03a9|\n\nZ Z\n\u03a9\n\ny f in (x, y) dx dy,\n\nR+\n\nd(y) \u2206x M + Q(M ) = 0.\nOn the other hand, the local equilibrium Mloc is\np\nMloc (x, y) = exp(\u2212y/ M1 (x))\nwhere the function x \u2208 \u03a9 \u2192 M1 (x) \u2208 R+ is given by\nZ\ny f (t, x, y) dy,\nM1 (x) :=\nR+\n\nand Mloc satisfies\n\nQ(Mloc ) = 0.\nThe relative entropy H(f |M ) can be split in two different parts\n(49)\n\nH(f |M ) = H(f |Mloc ) + H(Mloc |M ),\n\nwhere the first term in the right-hand side represents the \"distance\" between f and the local\nequilibrium whereas the second term evaluates the distance between the local and global equilibria\n16\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 1. Evolution of (a) the total number of particles M0 , the total volume M1 ,\nM2 and M3 (b) the functional H(f |M ), H(f |Mloc ) and H(Mloc |M ) in log scale.\nand only depends on the macroscopic quantity M1 . In the following we present some numerical\nresults. As an initial datum, we take\nf in (x, y) = exp(\u2212 \u03b1(x) y),\nwith \u03b1(x) = 1 + 0.1 cos(2 \u03c0 x1 ) cos(2 \u03c0 x2 ) and x = (x1 , x2 ) \u2208 (\u22121/2, 1/2)2 . The diffusion is taken\nto be constant d(y) = 0.1, R = 20, Ny = 64 and next 128 and finally \u2206t = 0.002.\nLet us first mention that in [14, 15] a similar problem i.e.; trend to equilibrium of the solution\nto the nonhomogeneous Boltzmann equation, is investigated numerically. It is shown that the\nrelative entropy with respect to the local equilibrium oscillates with time when the solution\nbecomes close to the equilibrium. Here, we will show that the situation is completely different\nand much simpler.\nIn Figure 1, we report the evolution of the total number of particles M0 , the high order moments in y of f h with respect to time and the Lyapunov functional H(f |M ). As expected, the\ntotal volume M1 (t) remains constant throughout time evolution and the moments stabilize to a\nfixed value. As regards the asymptotic profile, our numerical results are in fair agreement with\nthe equilibrium M (x) = exp(\u2212x). Moreover, we observe that the scheme is able to give the\ncorrect behavior of the numerical entropy H(f |M ), which converges exponentially fast to zero [5].\nHowever, we observe that trend to equilibrium for the coagulation-fragmentation with diffusion is\nmuch more simpler than trend to equilibrium for the Boltzmann equation [14] since no oscillation\noccurs for the relative entropy H(f |Mloc ). Indeed, after a short transient regime, the solution f\nconverges to equilibrium as an exponential with respect to time.\n5.2. Convergence to equilibrium for not detailed balance kernels. After this first result,\nwe now explore a different situation where nothing is known about equilibrium and entropy\n17\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 2.

Indeed, we choose kernels a and b as follows:\na(y, y \u2032 ) = (y y \u2032 )1/2 ,\n\nb(y, y \u2032 ) = 1.\n\nThe situation becomes much more complicated since we do not know neither the expression of\nthe steady state nor the expression of entropy. As an initial datum, we take\nf in (x, y) = exp(\u2212 \u03b1(x) y),\nwith \u03b1(x) = 1+0.5 cos(4 \u03c0 x1 ) cos(4 \u03c0 x2 ) and x = (x1 , x2 ) \u2208 [\u22121/2, 1/2]2 . Moreover, the diffusion\nis taken to be\nd(y) = 0.1/(1 + y),\nwhich is degenerated for large y. We choose the truncation such that R = 20, Ny = 64 and\nnext 128 and finally \u2206t = 0.002. In Figure 2, we still report the evolution of the total number\nof particles M0 and other high order moments in y of f h , that is M1 , M2 and M3 . As expected,\nthe total volume M1 (t) remains constant throughout time evolution, whereas high order moments\nvary and next stabilize to a fixed value, which means that the solution converges to a steady state.\nIn the same figure (right hand side), we also report the distribution function with respect to y in\nlog scale for large time, which indicates that the tail with respect to y of the steady state f \u0304 is\nstill exponentially decreasing and f \u0304 is of course constant in x \u2208 \u03a9.\n5.3. Convergence to equilibrium for non homogeneous boundary conditions. In this\nlast section, we study the coagulation-fragmentation operator with diffusion in space and mixed\nboundary conditions in x \u2208 \u03a9. More precisely, we aim to approximate the solution in \u03a9 =\n18\n\n\f(0, 1/8) \u00d7 (0, 1) to\n\uf8f1\n\u2202f\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u2212 d(y) \u2206x f = Q(f ), ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u2202t\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 f (t = 0, x, y) = f in (x, y), (x, y) \u2208 \u03a9 \u00d7 R+ ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nf (t, x1 = 0, x2 , y) = exp (\u2212y/\u03b1\u0303(x2 )) , (x2 , y) \u2208 \u2202\u03a9 \u00d7 R+ ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u2207x f * \u03bd(x) = 0, x1 = 1/8, or x2 = 0, or x2 = 1,\n\nwith \u03b1\u0303(x2 ) = (1 + cos(4\u03c0x2 ))/2 and \u03bd the external unit normal to \u2202\u03a9.\nWe consider an initial condition, which is at equilibrium for the coagulation fragmentation\noperator\nf in (x, y) = exp(\u2212y/\u03b1(x)), (x, y) \u2208 \u03a9 \u00d7 R+ ,\nwith \u03b1(x) = (1 + cos(32 \u03c0 x1 ) cos(4 \u03c0 x2 ))/2.\nWe perform numerical simulations using the finite volume scheme with diffusion coefficient\nd(y) = 0.01/(1 + y) and a = b \u2261 1. The following figures (Fig 3, 4 and 5) are illustrations of the\nprofile of the number of particles M0 (t, x) and total volume M1 (t, x) for t \u2208 R+ and x \u2208 \u03a9 and\nalso the projections\nZ 1/8\ny f (t, x, y)dx1 , x2 \u2208 (0, 1), y \u2208 R+ .\nP (t, x2 , y) =\n0\n\nIt allows us to observe the qualitative behavior of the system. The profiles are in that case smooth\nand also converges to an equilibrium. For such a computations we have considered Ny = 64 and\n128 \u00d7 128 grid points for the space variable x \u2208 \u03a9. In this situation, we cannot characterize\nexplicitly the equilibrium in space since the diffusion coefficient is not constant and H is not\nvalid here due to the Dirichlet boundary conditions for x1 = 0 and then the total volume is not\npreserved at all. However, we still observe that the numerical solution converges to a discrete\nequilibrium (see Fig. 3-5).\n6. Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we make use of different principles (volume conservation, entropy dissipation,\nexistence of steady states) which allow to build a stable and accurate numerical scheme for the\nnonlinear dynamics of coagulation, fragmentation and diffusion equations. Such an algorithm is\nable to recover the main properties of the exact solution and in some particular cases, it is proven\nthat the method is asymptotically stable, in the sense that the numerical solution converges to an\nequilibrium which is consistent with the exact equilibrium of the system. Numerical simulations\nillustrate the efficiency of the algorithm even when we cannot prove convergence to equilibrium.\nHere, we have only considered the time evolution of a distribution function, but the method\ncan be easily coupled with Euler or Navier-Stokes equations after some adaptations. Typical\napplications are transport problems (including linear and nonlinear diffusion or fluid dynamics),\nwhich are coupled with population balance dynamics represented by a distribution function f\ndepending on space x \u2208 \u03a9 and \"size\" variable y \u2208 R+ .\nOn the other hand, for some coagulation and fragmentation kernels [12, 4], total volume is not\nconserved at all and then a non conservative formulation can be used to dicretize the coagulation\nand fragmentation operators using the same kind of finite volume scheme. Then, the finite volume\n19\n\n\f1\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0\n0.02\n\n0.02\n\n0.4\n\n0.04\n0.06\n\n0.6\n\n0\n\n0.08\n\n0.4\n\n0.04\n0.06\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.08\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n0.12 0\n\n0.12 0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0\n0.02\n\n0\n0.02\n\n0.4\n\n0.04\n0.06\n\n0.4\n\n0.04\n0.06\n\n0.2\n\n0.08\n\n0.6\n\n0.2\n\n0.08\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n0.12 0\n\n0.12 0\n\nFigure 3.
