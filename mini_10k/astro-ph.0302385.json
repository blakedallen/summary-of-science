We have been recently faced with the problem of cross\u2013identifying stars recorded in historical catalogues\nwith those extracted from recent fully digitized surveys (such as DENIS and 2MASS). Positions mentioned in\nthe old catalogues are frequently of poor precision, but are generally accompanied by finding charts where the\ninteresting objects are flagged. Those finding charts are sometimes our only link with the accumulated knowledge\nof past literature. While checking the identification of some of these objects in several catalogues, we had the\nsurprise to discover a number of discrepancies in recent works.The main reason for these discrepancies was generally\nthe blind application of the smallest difference in position as the criterion to identify sources from one historical\ncatalogue to those in more recent surveys. In this paper we give examples of such misidentifications, and show how\nwe were able to find and correct them.We present modern procedures to discover and solve cross\u2013identification\nproblems, such as loading digitized images of the sky through the Aladin service at CDS, and overlaying entries\nfrom historical catalogues and modern surveys. We conclude that the use of good finding charts still remains the\nultimate (though time\u2013consuming) tool to ascertain cross\u2013identifications in difficult cases.\nKey words. Errata \u2013 Catalogs \u2013 Surveys \u2013 Stars: carbon \u2013 Magellanic Clouds\n\n1. Introduction\nThe question adressed in this Research Note is the following : can one cross\u2013identify old catalogues listing inaccurate coordinates with modern ones providing good coordinates using automatic blind matches ? Of course one\ncan, one just has to write or borrow rather simple routines and to digitize the old catalogue. But is the error\nrate acceptable ?\nHere we give a piece of answer, based on the cross\u2013\nidentification of the carbon star catalogue of Blanco &\nMcCarthy (1990, acronym LMC\u2013BM) with the one of\nKontizas et al. (2001, acronym [KDM2001]), as well as\nwith the DENIS Catalogue towards the Magellanic Clouds\n(Cioni et al. 2000, acronym DCMC). The sensitivity of\nboth surveys is similar, but Blanco & McCarthy were lim2\nited to 49 circular regions of \u223c 0.12\u25e6 , while Kontizas et\nal. have surveyed the whole LMC. From the restricted\npoint of view of this article, the main difference beSend offprint requests to: C. Loup\n\ntween both surveys is the astrometric accuracy, \u223c 1\u2032\u2032\nfor Kontizas et al., and better than 17\u2032\u2032 in Blanco &\nMcCarthy. Moreover, the way the astrometry was performed in Blanco & McCarthy involved much more manual work than in Kontizas et al., leading to a much higher\nrisk of human errors, as will be seen in Sect. 2. Kontizas\net al. have matched (automatically) both catalogues and\npresent the results in their Table 3. During the course\nof a more general work about cross\u2013identifications in the\nLMC, we have checked some of their results by looking at\nthe finding charts. This led us to cross\u2013identify the whole\nBlanco & McCarthy catalogue in the same \"old\u2013fashion\"\nway, and to compare it with automatic matches, as presented in Sec. 3. Sec. 4 lists a few additional errata. Short\nconclusions are given in Sect. 5.\n\n2. The case of the Blanco & McCarthy field 37\nThe case of the Blanco and McCarthy field number 37\nillustrates very well the risk of cross\u2013identifications in a\n\n\f2\n\nC. Loup et al.: On the usefulness of finding charts\n\nFig. 1. Distribution of distances between LMC\u2013BM and\nDCMC positions as derived from the cross\u2013identifications\nbased on finding charts.\n\"blind way\", that is, on the basis of poor coordinates\nonly. We would like to suggest the reader to visit the\nCentre de Donn\u00e9es Astronomiques de Strasbourg (CDS,\nhttp://cdsweb.u\u2013strasbg.fr), then the Aladin image facility, to type in the coordinates of, for instance, LMC\u2013BM\n37\u201320 (05 43 42 \u201370 27.5, J2000), and to load the ESO\nMAMA or AAO DSS2 digitized R image. At first view\none does not recognize the field of the finding chart. At\nsecond view neither. The experience can be made with\nany star of the field 37, the field centered on the coordinates never corresponds to the one of the finding chart.\nHowever, if one looks at, for instance, LMC\u2013BM 37\u201324 (05\n44 03 \u201370:26.1, J2000), one can recognize the field thanks\nto two bright stars, both very far away from the expected\nlocation, more precisely about 50s (4\u2032 ) towards the West\nand 2\u2032 towards the South. It turns out that all the positions of the LMC\u2013BM stars in the field 37 are erroneous\nby about 4.5\u2032 , as well as the position of the field center.\n(The reason for this error remains unknown).\nKontizas et al. find 13 cross\u2013identifications in this field,\n29% of the total number of C stars found by Blanco &\nMcCarthy. As the shift of the position is about 4.5\u2032 , while\nthe search radius of Kontizas et al. was about 1\u2032 , it is\nclear that the 13 cross\u2013identifications given by Kontizas\net al. must all be erroneous. They are just random associations. This problem has some consequences on the\ncross\u2013identifications with field 42 as well, because it is located very close to field 37. Five cross\u2013identifications were\nmissed because the corresponding [KDM2001] star was already associated to an LMC\u2013BM star of the field 37. In\nreality, Kontizas et al. and Blanco & McCarthy have 30\nstars in common in the field 37.\n\n3. Finding charts versus automatic blind match\nThe case of the Blanco & McCarthy field 37 may be considered as an accident. However, Kontizas et al. find a surprisingly large number of random associations in this field.\nIt does occur that two LMC\u2013BM C stars are separated by\nless than 1\u2032 , and sometimes by less than 30\u2032\u2032 . Moreover, for\n\nvarious reasons discussed in both catalogues, both surveys\nare incomplete, especially the one of Kontizas et al. in the\nmost crowded regions (see their Sect. 5.3 and the field 33\nin Table 1). It follows that to find a carbon star in both\ncatalogues separated by less than 1\u2032 does not necessarily\nmean that they are the same star. From the example of the\nfield 37 we thus expected to find some misidentifications\nin the other fields.\nWe have cross\u2013identified the 849 C stars listed in the\nBlanco & McCarthy catalogue with the Kontizas et al.\nand the DCMC (Cioni et al. 2000) catalogues, using the\nfinding charts. We have proceeded in the following way.\nWe use the CDS Aladin facility. We first load a R image\n(ESO MAMA or AAO DSS2) centered on the Blanco &\nMcCarthy coordinates. Then, comparing with their finding chart, we mark the carbon star. Finally, using the CDS\nVizieR database, we superimpose the Kontizas et al. and\nDCMC (or 2MASS or GSC2.2) catalogues on the digitized\nimage. As in general these catalogues have good coordinates (\u223c 1\u2032\u2032 accurate), there is usually no doubt on identifying the star, except in very few cases of double stars. In\nthe latter case, we could always identify the carbon star,\nby comparing the I magnitude in Kontizas et al. and in\nthe DCMC, or because one star was much too blue to be\na carbon star (J \u2212 KS < 0.5 mag.).\nTable 1, available electronically only at CDS, summarizes the cross\u2013identifications between the Blanco &\nMcCarthy and Kontizas et al. catalogues, field by field. In\ntotal, out of 849 stars, 69.0% are re\u2013discovered in Kontizas\net al., and 99.1% are listed in the DCMC. The list of the\ncross\u2013identifications for individual stars is given in Table\n2, available electronically only at CDS. It gives the LMC\u2013\nBM, [KDM2001], and DCMC identifications. We found\nsome double entries in the DCMC, which are listed as\nwell. Cross\u2013identifications between the DCMC, 2MASS,\nand the GSC2.2 catalogues are given in Delmotte et al.\n(2002).\nThe distribution of distances between the LMC\u2013BM\nand DCMC positions is shown in Fig. 1. According to\nBlanco & McCarthy, the accuracy of both their coordinates is expected to be smaller than 12\u2032\u2032 , so that the global\nerror on the position is expected to be smaller than 17\u2032\u2032 .\nIn fact more than a quarter of the sources have a distance\nto the DCMC position larger than 17\u2032\u2032 . The tail of the\ndistribution reaches 40\u2032\u2032 . To this general distribution one\nhas to add 52 particular cases: (i) the 45 sources of the\nfield 37 are shifted by \u223c 4.5\u2032 as seen in Sect. 2; (ii) the 4\nsources of the field 49 are shifted by \u223c 50\u221255\u2032\u2032 ; (iii) LMC\u2013\nBM 6\u201320, 38\u201310, and 42\u201332, are found 62, 67, and 48\u2032\u2032\naway from the DCMC position, respectively. One thus may\nsay that the Blanco & McCarthy positions are erroneous\nfor 6.1% of their sources. Finally, we suspect that there\ncould be an additional error in one finding chart. LMC\u2013\nBM 3\u20133, as drawn on the finding chart, corresponds to\nDCMC J044614.35-675116.8 = 2MASSI J0446143-675116,\nwith I \u2212 J \u2243 0.5 and J \u2212 KS \u2243 0.35 mag. This source\nseems to be much too blue to be a C star. About 40\u2032\u2032 away,\nthere is a C star, [KDM2001] 457. We thus suspect that\n\n\fC. Loup et al.: On the usefulness of finding charts\n\n[KDM2001] 457 and LMC\u2013BM 3\u20133 are in fact the same\nstar while Blanco & McCarthy would have indicated the\nwrong star on the finding chart.\nTo cross\u2013identify 849 objects by looking at the finding charts is not the most pleasing work one could imagine, nor is it the technique one would first think of to\ncross\u2013identify catalogues. By default one would first make\na digitized version of the old Blanco & McCarthy catalogue, and match it automatically with that of Kontizas\net al. To compare with the results derived from the finding charts, we have also matched blindly both catalogues.\nWithout knowing the distribution in Fig. 1, and being a\nlittle cautious, one would most likely use a search radius of\n30\u2032\u2032 . We finally matched both catalogues using two radii,\n30\u2032\u2032 and 1\u2032 . In case of multiple associations, we strictly\nkeep the closest one, checking on both entire catalogues.\nThe results field by field are listed in Table 1. Compared\nto the finding chart method, an automatic match leads\nto 11 (1.3%) and 20 (2.4%) misidentifications using a radius of 30\u2032\u2032 and 1\u2032 , respectively. Among these misidentifications, only 30% are due to erroneous LMC\u2013BM coordinates, all the others are due to the presence of two close\ncarbon stars. The number of missed cross\u2013identifications\namounts to 5.4% using 30\u2032\u2032 , and 3.3% using 1\u2032 . For both\nsearch radii the total number of errors is about 6%. This\nis far from being negligible. Misidentifications are especially problematic for individual sources. It could lead to\ndiscover strange variables, and derive incorrect physical\nparameters. Missed cross\u2013identifications lead to a loss of\ninformation on individual sources. Both are problematic\nfor statistical purposes because some sources would disappear, or conversely would be counted twice.\nIn their Table 3, Kontizas et al. give cross\u2013\nidentifications between their catalogue and that of Blanco\n& McCarthy. According to their Sect. 5.3, they have\nmatched both catalogues. Their results are summarized\nin the last 3 columns of Table 1. They find a match for\n3 out of 4 LMC\u2013BM sources of the field 49, for LMC\u2013\nBM 6\u201320, but not for LMC\u2013BM 38\u201310 (see above), so\nmost likely they used an association radius of about 1\u2032 .\nHowever, there are some differences between their results\nand our match with the same radius. In the field 37, we\nget only 7 misidentifications, while they list 13. The most\nlikely reason is that, in case of multiple associations, they\nhave kept the closest one field by field rather than on the\nentire catalogue. Out of the 6 matches that we do not find\nin the field 37, one source is a little more than 1\u2032 away from\nthe [KDM2001] position, and the 5 others have a closer association in the field 42 (see also Sect. 2). The other difference is the larger number of missed cross\u2013identifications\nin the list of Kontizas et al. than found in our match.\nAccording to Morgan (private communication) they are\ndue to human errors when compiling the final Table. In\ntotal, the number of misidentifications and missed cross\u2013\nidentifications amounts to 2.7 and 7.9%, respectively, in\nthe Table 3 of Kontizas et al.\nFinally, out of curiosity, we have also matched the\nBlanco & McCarthy and DCMC catalogues, using a search\n\n3\n\nradius of 30\u2032\u2032 , and taking into account some redundant entries in the DCMC which are correctly seen as the same\nsource. Of course, the density of sources in the DCMC\n(or in 2MASS) is such that it would not be reasonable to\njust match both catalogues on the basis of the coordinates\nonly. We have then added some colour criteria. Almost all\nLMC\u2013BM stars have I \u2212 J > 1.2 and J \u2212 KS > 0.8. The\nlast colour criterion is confirmed by the Fig.5 of Kontizas\net al. Even applying this, a match between both catalogues\nleads to . . . a disaster, with 24.8% of misidentifications,\nand 2.5% of missed cross\u2013identifications. To use a larger\nradius would not change much the result because only 23\nLMC\u2013BM sources do not have a match within 30\u2032\u2032 .\n\n4. More errata . . .\nIt is not uncommon to find erroneous or missed cross\u2013\nidentifications, or errors on the listed coordinates, in published catalogues. During the course of more general cross\u2013\nidentifications in the Large Magellanic Cloud, we found a\nfew errors in various papers, sometimes real errors, sometimes probably misprints.\nIn the catalogue of M supergiants and suspected giants\nof Westerlund et al. (1981), the listed coordinates are in\ngeneral better than 5\u2032\u2032 , with a tail in the distribution up to\nabout 20\u2032\u2032 . We however found 5 stars in the list of the M\nsupergiants with erroneous coordinates (i.e. in disagreement by more than 1\u2032 with the finding chart location).\nThese sources are: WOH S 66, S 151, S 156, S 199, and S\n212. Like in the case of Kontizas et al. with the Blanco &\nMcCarthy field 37, we find that the erroneous coordinates\nof Westerlund et al. have led to at least one misidentification in the literature. We have checked on finding charts\nthat WOH S 66, SP77 30\u20136 (Sanduleak & Philip 1977),\nRM 1\u201345 (Rebeirot et al. 1983), and DCMC J045421.73\u2013\n684524.1 are the same star. Remarkably, the coordinates\nlisted by Westerlund et al. for WOH S 66 are in excellent\nagreement with those of Hughes (1989) for SHV 0454257\u2013\n684856, alias DCMC J045414.33\u2013684414.2. It follows that\nWOH S 66 was misidentified with SHV 0454257\u2013684856\nin Loup et al. (1997). The IRAS source IRAS 04544\u20136849,\nLI\u2013LMC 153 (Schwering & Israel 1990), is more likely associated to the SHV star than to the M supergiant. For\nsure, the object observed with ISO in Trams et al. (1999)\nwas the Long Period Variable (SHV) star and not WOH\nS 66.\nOld catalogues, though in principle checking carefully\nthe cross\u2013identifications on finding charts, do not all escape the problem. For instance Sanduleak & Philip (1977)\nhave erroneously identified SP77 46\u201359 with HV 2650,\nwhile the SP77 star is actually HV 996. Similarly, SP77\n51\u20137 is HV 5916, while Sanduleak & Philip give HV 591.\nThis latter case is probably a misprint.\nThe Blanco & McCarthy catalogue has a few mistakes\nas well. In particular, it associates twice SP77 30\u201320, once\nwith LMC\u2013BM 9\u201313, and once with LMC\u2013BM 9\u201323. A\ncareful check of the finding charts shows that LMC\u2013BM\n9\u201313 is not associated to any SP77 star, that SP77 30\u201320\n\n\f4\n\nC. Loup et al.: On the usefulness of finding charts\n\nis LMC\u2013BM 9\u201318, and that LMC\u2013BM 9\u201323 is SP77 30\u201321.\nThe last case is very likely a misprint. Blanco & McCarthy\nalso forgot some associations. In particular, their fields\n16 and 15 (\"Bar West\", published earlier by Blanco et\nal. 1980, acronym BMB) overlap. They provide 15 cross\u2013\nidentifications between both fields. Detailed checks show\nthat they missed three additional cross\u2013identifications:\nBMB\u2013BW 37 = LMC\u2013BM 16\u201316, BMB\u2013BW 38 = LMC\u2013\nBM 16\u201320, and BMB\u2013BW 54 = LMC\u2013BM 16\u201326.\n\n5. Conclusions\nIn practice, depending on the quality of the finding charts\nand on problems arising, and using modern facilities like\nAladin at CDS, it is possible to check 20 to 50 finding charts per day, including lunch and coffee breaks. To\nuse finding charts to cross\u2013identify the DCMC, 2MASS,\nand GSC2.2 catalogues, each containing a few million\nstars towards the LMC only, one would need an army of\nBenedictine monks working day and night over 10 years. It\nis fortunately not required either because, in general, the\nthree catalogues provide coordinates more accurate than\n1\u2032\u2032 . Thus, a match based on coordinates, plus some additional validation criteria, allows one to reach an acceptable\nerror rate (Delmotte et al. 2002).\nOn the other hand, not all astronomical objects have\ngood coordinates yet, especially those discovered in old\ncatalogues. Most of them have been reobserved in modern\ncatalogues, however the observations of these modern catalogues do not necessarily allow to determine the nature\nof the object. Thus it is important to keep our knowledge,\nand then to cross\u2013identify properly old and modern catalogues. For instance, many planetary nebulae discovered\nin the Magellanic Clouds have been detected by 2MASS.\nBut from the 2MASS data, it is impossible to set any selection criteria to find planetary nebulae. Most of them just\nlook like faint blue stars, or overlap with the large population of RGB stars, like millions of others sources. In such\na case it is obvious that to cross\u2013identify old catalogues\nof planetary nebulae with 2MASS must be done with the\nfinding charts. Carbon stars are a better case because they\nare red objects which are much less numerous than faint\nblue stars. However, as shown in this Research Note, even\nthis is not so straightforward. Misidentifications in the\nliterature are also a problem for compilation databases\nsuch as SIMBAD and NED. Matching procedures are continuously improved, but case by case examination by an\nexpert often remains necessary, as demonstrated in this\nNote. Among others, the contribution of B. Skiff, in this\nrespect, is specifically acknowledged by the CDS.\nTo conclude, if one of the catalogues has poor coordinates (accuracy worse than 5\u2032\u2032 ), if one is not looking at an\nempty region of the sky, if the objects do not have extraordinary colours or physical properties, and are not shining\nlike the lighthouse of Alexandria, there is no other way to\nmake cross\u2013identifications than to go back to the finding\ncharts. Yes, it is time\u2013consuming.\n\nAcknowledgements. We are very grateful to the referee Dr.\nH.J. Habing for his helpful comments and suggestions. We\nwould like to thank Dr. D.H.
