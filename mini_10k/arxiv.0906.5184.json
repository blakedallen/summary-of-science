These stripes of increased diamagnetic susceptibility are consistent\nwith enhanced superfluid density on twin boundaries. Individual vortices avoid pinning\non or crossing the stripes, and prefer to travel parallel to them. These results indicate a\nrelationship between superfluid density, local strain, and frustrated magnetism, and\ndemonstrate two mechanisms for enhancing critical currents.\n\n1\n\n\fThe iron arsenide superconductors have critical temperatures Tc up to 57 K, multiband Fermi surfaces, and undoped parent compounds that have an antiferromagnetic,\northorhombic state below temperatures of ~100-200 K. In Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 and other\nmembers of the 122 family (AFe2As2 with A = Ca, Sr, Ba), doping causes the spin\ndensity wave transition temperature TSDW and the structural transition temperature TS to\ndecrease [1,2], falling to zero at or near the doping where the highest Tc occurs,\nsuggesting the importance of lattice changes in determining transport properties.\nProposals for magnetic mechanisms for superconductivity range from antiparamagnons\n[3] to magnetic antiphasons [4]. The existence of a large magnetoelastic effect in\ncalculations [5], the close relationship between the structural and magnetic transitions [6],\nand the observation of a large and similar iron isotope effect for both Tc and TSDW [7] all\nindicate the close relationship between structural and magnetic properties, to the point\nthat some authors describe both the lattice and the SDW with a single order parameter\n[8,9]. Structural inhomogeneity is also important: in the 122 compounds, very small\namounts of non-hydrostatic pressure can induce superconductivity [10-13], suggesting\nthat structural inhomogeneity enhances superconductivity. Lattice changes due to\npressure and chemical doping are remarkably similar [14,15]. The recent observation of\ntwin boundaries in the 122 parent compounds [16] offers a controlled source of structural\nvariation. We find that images of the local diamagnetic susceptibility (Figure 1) of single\ncrystals of underdoped Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 show a striped pattern for T \u2264 Tc. , and we show\nthat these features are consistent with a large enhancement of the superfluid density on\nthe twin boundaries.\nThe crystal growth is described elsewhere [1]. We use a variable-T scanning\nSQUID susceptometer [17-19] with two field coil / pickup loop pairs (Figure 1a overlay\nsketch) in a gradiometer configuration. Each pair has a mutual inductance \u03c7 = 800 \u03c60/A.\nThe susceptibility of the pair that is scanned close to the sample is modified by an amount\n\u0394\u03c7 [20]. The exact relationship of \u0394\u03c7 to the local magnetic penetration depth \u03bb and\nsuperfluid density ns ~ 1/\u03bb2 is determined by the sample and sensor geometry as\ndescribed in [17-21]. For a uniform sample in the limit of small ns, \u0394\u03c7 \u221d ns. The spatial\n\n2\n\n\fresolution is primarily determined by the pickup loop diameter (3 \u03bcm), although the field\ncoil diameter (13 \u03bcm) and sample-sensor separation (1-2 \u03bcm) also play a role.\nWe observe lines of enhanced diamagnetic susceptibility, henceforth called\n\"stripes\", along the orthorhombic [110] or [ 1 1 0 ] crystalline directions. The spacing of\nthe stripes is not periodic and varies between 10-16 \u03bcm in Figure 1, up to 35 \u03bcm in other\nparts of this sample, and down to 5 \u03bcm in parts of other samples. There were also regions\nof each sample that did not show any stripes.\nThe spacing and orientation of the stripes, the known orthorhombicity of Ba(Fe1xCox)2As2\n\non the underdoped side, and the recent demonstration of the existence of twin\n\nboundaries in the parent compound [16], all suggest identifying the stripes with twin\nboundaries (Figure 1d-g). Recent local polarization and x-ray measurements by Tanatar\net al. [16] in the undoped parent compound BaFe2As2 have confirmed that the twin\nboundaries form in stripes spaced by around 10-50 \u03bcm, and shift position between\nthermal cycles above TS.\nWe checked the hypothesis that the stripes are twin boundaries in three ways.\nFirst, we checked their behavior on thermal cycling (Figure 2). The stripes disappear on\nincreasing T above Tc, but reappear in the same locations when cooled as long as T is not\nraised above Ts. However, each time T is raised above TS and then decreased below Tc,\nthe stripes reappear in somewhat different locations, consistent with twin boundaries,\nwhich would be formed as T decreases through TS.\nSecond, in all the samples studied (Table 1), the stripes appeared only in\nunderdoped samples, consistent with twin boundaries, which would not exist in the\ntetragonal overdoped samples.\nThird, we made T dependent powder x-ray diffraction measurements on samples\nfrom x = 0% to 5.1%, which confirmed the existence of the tetragonal to orthorhombic\nphase transition at a doping dependent T from 135K to 55K. We also confirmed the\nexistence of a structural phase transition on three single-crystal samples with dopings of\n\n3\n\n\f0%, 2.5%, and 5.1% using spatially resolved single-crystal x-ray diffraction with a beam\nspot of 10 \u03bcm. We found that each sample formed twins with at least two different\norientations, again consistent with the hypothesis of enhanced diamagnetic susceptibility\non twin boundaries.\nThe susceptibility of each sample (Figure 3a) was measured as the difference\nbetween the \u0394\u03c7 high above the sample and in contact at a specific location (Method 1) or\n\u0394\u03c7 averaged over a region of the sample (Method 2). The difference in low-T \u0394\u03c7\nbetween UD1 and UD3 is likely due to uncertainty in the sensor-sample separation. As\nexpected, \u0394\u03c7 decreases with increasing T until it disappears at Tc, where \u03bb diverges. The\nlocally measured Tc typically varied by ~\u00b10.25K for different regions of the samples with\nx = 5.1% (UD1, UD3, and UD5), by ~\u00b11K for samples with x = 4.5% (UD2 and UD4),\nand by ~\u00b10.1K for samples with x = 6.1% and 8.5% (OD1, OD2, and OPD1).\nThe magnitude of the susceptibility signal associated with the stripes, \u0394\u03c7stripe(T),\nfor three individual stripes is shown in Figure 3b (from the stripe images on the right side\nof figure 4b and 4d). The typical T-dependence in both samples is similar (Figure 3c).\n\u0394\u03c7stripe ~ 2-6 \u03a60/A is comparable to the bulk susceptibility signal close to Tc, but much\nsmaller than the saturated bulk susceptibility \u03c7sample ~ 600 \u03a60/A at lower T. The reduction\nof \u0394\u03c7stripe at lower T likely reflects more effective screening from the bulk.\nThe spatial width of every stripe was apparently limited by our spatial resolution.\nTo estimate the superfluid density associated with \u0394\u03c7stripe, we used fasthenry (Whiteley\nResearch) to model a stripe as a vertical slab of width w between 0.2 and 5.0 \u03bcm with\npenetration depth \u03bbstripe between 0.2 and 5 \u03bcm. For narrow vertical slabs with enhanced\nns, we found \u0394\u03c7 proportional to sheet density nsw, with \u0394\u03c7stripe ~ 6 \u03a60/A corresponding to\nnsw ~1019 m-2, assuming a bulk penetration depth \u03bbbulk \u2265 10 \u03bcm. Incorporating stronger\nMeissner screening in the bulk (with \u03bbbulk between 0.2 and 10 \u03bcm) reduced the signal,\nimplying that 1019 m-2 is an order of magnitude lower bound.\n\n4\n\n\fThe stripes dramatically affect the behavior of individual vortices. Figure 4\ncompares susceptometry with magnetometry images. The magnetometry images show\nindividual vortices, pinned on local defects, whose small density is consistent with the\nsmall magnetic field in the cryostat. These images are similar to those observed in other\ntype II superconductors, except that in multiple thermal cycles on multiple samples, every\nvortex avoids pinning directly on a stripe. The vortices also avoid the stripes when\nmoving under the influence of temperature or the SQUID. Close to Tc, where vortices are\nweakly pinned and easily moved, they tend to move along the nearest stripe, and avoid\ncrossing it. In figure 4g, we applied a small dc current to the field coil to create a\ncontrolled ~0.7 pN force [22] on the vortex shown while imaging it at 15.5 K: despite the\napplied force, it did not cross the stripe but moved easily along it.\nAs T increases, the vortices spread out and become more mobile until at 18K we\ncannot detect them. At these temperatures the stripes can be seen in magnetometry\nimages with a small amplitude of ~ 0.03 \u03a60. We suspect that the reason the stripes are\nvisible in magnetometry here is the distorted magnetic shape of the vortices, which, while\nvery large, still terminate on the stripes.\nThat vortices avoid the stripes is consistent with enhanced superfluid density on\nthe stripes: it is more energetically costly to create a vortex core in a region of enhanced\nsuperfluid density. This behavior is in sharp contrast to the behavior observed in\nErNi2B2C, where, in a small magnetic field, all vortices are observed to sit specifically on\ntwin boundaries in the antiferromagnetic and superconducting state [23-25]. The behavior\nof avoiding twin boundaries is also opposite to the familiar picture of twin boundaries in\nthe cuprate superconductor YBCO, where vortices are either trapped on the boundary or\nchannel along it, in both cases preferring to be co-located with the twin boundary [26-28].\nAll the data are consistent with a substantial enhancement of superfluid density on\nthe twin boundaries in underdoped Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2, persisting to within at least 0.2 K of\nTC. Two immediately apparent explanations for a variation in ns at a twin boundary are\nunlikely to apply here. First, variation in chemical doping across the twin boundary is\nunlikely, because the structural transition occurs well below 200 K. Second, in elemental\n\n5\n\n\fSn or Nb, there is enhanced Tc at a twin boundary due to phonon softening [29].\nHowever, conventional electron-phonon coupling alone cannot explain the Tc of the\npnictides [30], and the dominant effect that we report here is an enhanced ns.\nMore exotic categories of explanations include the possibility that the local\nsymmetry of the twin boundary allows competing superconducting order parameters to\narise, or that the presence of the twin boundary modifies the spin density wave and allows\nsuperconductivity to gain the upper hand in the competition between the two. In Figure\n1g we have drawn the co-linear antiferromagnetic ordering of the Fe spins below TSDW in\nthe configuration they would have without the twin boundary. It is clear that along the\ntwin boundaries the spin orientation is ill-defined, which may enhance spin-fluctuation\nmediated pairing along the boundary.\nThe present measurements may be related to results that connect\nstructural/magnetic deformations to superconductivity[10-12,31]. For example, the multiphase structure present under non-hydrostatic pressure may have an increased number of\nplanar structural inhomogeneities[10-12]. As another example, SrFe2As2 shows a\ndecreasing volume fraction of superconductivity with increasing Tc vs. pressure on the\nunderdoped side of the phase diagram in [31]. Since moving along the pressure axis\nchanges the surface area of twin boundaries as well as their strain, our results would\nprovide a natural reason why Tc might not follow the bulk superconducting transition.\nThe observation of enhanced superfluid density along two-dimensional planes,\nwhich likely are twin boundaries, indicates the need for caution in interpreting sampleaveraged measurements in terms of homogeneous properties. In addition, it provides a\nphysical realization of a relatively well-understood source of inhomogeneity that has a\nmajor effect on superfluid density. Any correct theory of the relationship between\nstructure, superconductivity, and magnetism should be able to explain the presence of an\nenhanced superfluid density on the twin boundaries.\nFinally, we note that the behavior we observe here should increase the bulk Jc in\ntwo ways: by providing a channel for increased supercurrent density along the twins, and\n\n6\n\n\fby providing strong barriers to vortex motion across the twins. These results suggest that\nincreasing twin density should increase the sample-averaged bulk Jc.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank O.M. Auslaender, Lan Luan, A. Auerbach and A.

(a) Local diamagnetic susceptibility, at\nT=17 K, of the ab face of sample UD1 (x = 0.051, Tc = 18.25 K), showing stripes of\nenhanced diamagnetic response (white). Overlay: sketch of the scanning SQUID's\nsensor. The size of the pickup loop sets the spatial resolution of the susceptibility images.\n(b,c) Images of the same region at T=(b) 17.5 K and (c) 18.5K show that the stripes\ndisappear above Tc. (d) BaFe2As2 unit cell in the (e) tetragonal and (f) orthorhombic\nphases (orthorhombic distortion exaggerated for clarity). (g) Possible twin boundary\nconfiguration. Spins on the Fe sites are drawn in the configuration that they would have\nin the absence of the twin boundary.\nFigure 2: Effect of thermal cycling on the locations of the stripes. (a-c) Local\nsusceptibility images at 17 K (a) before and (b) after thermal cycling to T=25 K, above Tc\nbut below TS/SDW, show (c) unchanged stripe locations. (d-f) Images (d) before and (e)\nafter thermal cycling to 90 K, above TS/SDW, show (f) changed stripe locations.\nFigure 3: Temperature dependence of the local diamagnetism. (a) Typical susceptibility\nsignal \u0394\u03c7(T) in samples UD1 and UD3 vs. T/Tc. (b) Amplitude for three individual\nstripes in UD3 (stripes shown in Figs. 4b and 4d). (c) Average stripe amplitude for one\nregion of UD1 and two different regions of UD3. T is scaled by the local Tc=18.5K for\nUD1 and 18K for UD3.\nFigure 4: Interaction between vortices and stripes. (a) Magnetometry and (b)\nsusceptometry images of the same region of UD3 at 5 K. Comparison of stripe (b) to\nvortex (a) locations shows that no vortex is pinned on a stripe. Light grey disks at the\nvortex locations in (b) are artifacts related to nonlinearity in the SQUID feedback loop at\nthis set-point. (c,d) show the same location imaged at 15K, where the vortices are\ndragged by an attraction to the SQUID sensor, and tend to move along the stripes. (e)\nOverlay of susceptometry and magnetometry images in UD1 at 17.5K, where the vortices\nare wider. The vortices move during the scan, generally avoid crossing the stripes, and\n\n10\n\n\fshow a distorted shape near the stripes. Magnetometry (f) and susceptometry (g) images\nof a single vortex sitting between stripes in UD3, imaged with a current on the field coil\nto apply an attractive field coil - vortex force of ~0.7pN. The vortex is dragged by the\nfield coil at 15K, but only moves between the stripes, not across them. Arrows in (f)\nshow scan directions: the sensor is incremented along the long arrow while rastered back\nand forth along the double arrows.\n\n11\n\n\fTable 1.
