It comprises a central 60m x 80m\nx 8m pond surrounded by a 200m x 200m array of 175 \"outrigger\" tanks. The pond, covered\nwith a light barrier, is instrumented with two layers of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). The top \"airshower\" layer consists of 450 PMTs while the bottom \"muon\" layer has 273 PMTs. Each outrigger\ntank contains \u223c4000l of water and one PMT. The\nPMTs collect the Cherenkov light produced by the\nair shower particles, as they transverse the detector's water volume. The AS and OR layers allow\nthe accurate measurement of the air shower particle arrival times used for reconstructing the direction of the shower-initiating particle. The greater\ndepth of the muon layer (\u223c17 radiation lengths) is\nused to distinguish deeply penetrating muons and\nhadrons, which are common in hadron induced air\nshowers, from electrons and \u03b3-rays.\nThe motivation for the uniformity tests described\nhere was a disagreement between the single-muon\nresponse of the muon-layer PMTs and a Monte\nCarlo simulation of this response. According to the\nPMT tests performed by the IceCube experiment1,\nthe photocathode response of their 10' PMTs is not\nuniform all over the photocathode's surface. Be-\n\nfore the experimental work reported in this paper,\nthe Milagro PMTs were simulated as having the\nsame properties all over the face of the PMT. We\nthought it possible that the way the PMTs were\nsimulated was the cause of the disagreement regarding the single-muon response of the muonlayer PMTs.\nFor that reason, an apparatus was constructed to\nexamine the dependence of the gain and detection\nefficiency on the distance of the photon-detection\nposition from the center of the photocathode.\n\nExperimental setup\nA light source that produced a narrow parallel\nbeam of light was constructed. Its body was composed of two threaded tubes and a ND2 optical filter between them. Two end-caps were attached to\nthe edges of the light source. Each end-cap had\na hole of 4.8mm diameter. One of the end-caps\nwas used to firmly hold an LED and the other as\na collimator. The light was produced by a 5mm\ndiameter red NSPR518AS LED by Nichia Corp.\nIts biggest advantage is that its spectral response is\nnarrow (<30nm FWHM) and that it is stable under\n1. http://www.ppl.phys.chibau.jp/research/IceCube/docs/presentations/index.html\n\n\fT ESTS ON THE R5912 H AMAMATSU PMT\n\nThe tests\nExamining the gain of the PMT\nThe best way to examine the gain was to measure\nthe charge of the pulses. However, due to the fact\nthat no instruments with this capability were available, we measured the pulse heights instead. As\nit was found, the widths of the pulses were almost\nindependent of their height. For that reason, we\ncould assume that the charge of a pulse was directly proportional to its height. Thus, the gain\ncould be examined by measuring the pulse heights.\nFor making the pulse height distributions, the PMT\npulses were analyzed with a digital oscilloscope.\nFor this test, the light source was operated in\npulsed mode. In this mode a pulse generator was\nused for driving the light source and for triggering\nthe oscilloscope. The oscilloscope measured the\namplitudes of the PMT pulses, and sent the results\nto a PC through the serial port. The light level was\nlow enough that the PMT detected a signal from\nonly a small percentage of the light pulses, so almost all of the PMT pulses corresponded to a single PE. The dark rate of the PMT was about 2KHz,\n\nso on average there was just one dark noise hit digitized every \u223c 2 * 104 triggers.\nIn all the following pulse height spectra, the\npedestal 2 is suppressed and the curves are normalized.\nDependence of the gain on the photon-detection\nposition\nPulse height distributions were made for different\nillumination positions on the photocathode. One\nof the PMTs was extensively tested (PMT #1024).\nFor the other two PMTs, only the side (equator)\nand top illumination positions were examined.\nThe results of the tests on PMT #1024 are shown in\nfigures 1 and 2. The angle of an illumination position is defined as the distance of this position from\nthe center of the photocathode (measured on the\nsurface of the PMT) over the total distance from\nthe center to the equator times 90o . This way, 0o\ncorresponds to the center of the photocathode and\n90o to the equator. The gain was significantly reduced when the illumination position was near the\nthe equator of the PMT. While it remained almost\nconstant from the center of the photocathode to\nabout 52o , there was a sharp transition after that\npoint, with the gain reducing in size by a factor of\n\u223c 2.7 in only 20o .\nThe gain for illumination at 90o was also significantly reduced in the other two tested PMTs.\nMost probable pulse height (mV)\n\nchanges in temperature. The resulting light beam\nhad an opening angle of \u223c 1o .\nThree Hamamatsu R5912 PMTs from Milagro\nwere tested. From these, one (PMT #1024) was\nextensively tested.\nThe tests required the light source to be positioned\nin predefined positions with respect to the PMT\nface. A wooden structure was built for that purpose. With the help of clamps, the PMT and the\nlight source were mounted steadily on the structure. The light source was always touching the surface of the glass and was oriented perpendicularly\nto it.\nIn all the tests, the PMT was in an optically\nshielded black box. Before each test, the PMT\nwas conditioned under voltage until its dark noise\nrate fell to normal levels (<2KHz). The magnetic\nfield at the location of the tests was measured to be\nabout 0.5Gauss. Unless otherwise noted, the tests\nwere made using PMT #1024, the supply voltage\nwas 1800V and the PMT was in the vertical position (photocathode facing up).\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n90\nAngle (deg)\n\nFigure 1: Most probable pulse height for each of\nthe examined illumination positions\n2.

Only a\nsmall dependence of the gain on the PMT orientation was found. Next, the same PMT orientations\nand supply voltages were tested for illumination of\nthe side of the photocathode. As in the previous\nsection, the gain for illumination at the side of the\nPMT was considerably lower than the one for illumination at the top (figures 4 and 5). Again, in\nthe horizontal position the gain was slightly higher\nthan in the vertical position. Increasing the supply\nvoltage (and as a consequence, the voltage between\nthe photocathode and the first dynode) increased\nthe gain only when the PMT was in the horizontal\nposition.\nEvents/(1.6mV)\n\n3.5\n\n1600V_vertical\n1800V_vertical\n2000V_vertical\n1600V_horizontal\n1800V_horizontal\n2000V_horizontal\n\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n\n14\n\n90 deg\n\n12\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n8\n6\n4\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n160\n180\nPulse height(mV)\n\n2\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n120\nPulse height (mV)\n\nFigure 2: Pulse height distribution for illumination\nof different positions on the photocathode\nDependence of the gain on the supply voltage\nand PMT orientation for illumination at the top\nand the side of the photocathode\nTo further examine the dependence of the gain on\nthe photon-detection position, we tried to find any\ncorrelations between this dependence and the supply voltage and PMT orientation.

Each set was composed of two\nbackground measurements, followed by two signal measurements and then followed by two background measurements. The duration of each measurement was 10sec. The count rate, when the\nPMT was illuminated, was of the order of tens of\nKHz.\nTable 1 shows the relative detection efficiency for\nillumination at various points of the photocathode\nvs illumination at its center.\n\nThe photocathode uniformity of the Hamamatsu\nR5912 PMTs used in the Milagro experiment was\nexamined.

Both quantities are smaller\nwhen points near the edge of the photocathode are\nilluminated. This effect was present in all tested\nPMTs and was not negligible in magnitude.\nBefore this study, the Milagro PMTs were simulated as having the same properties all over the\nface of the PMT. After using the experimental results in the simulation of the PMTs, the simulation\nnow predicts that an atmospheric muon produces\n\u223c110PEs (down from \u223c200PEs) in the PMTs of\nthe muon layer compared with \u223c100PEs at the experiment.\n\nReferences\n[1] Atkins, R.W. et al.
