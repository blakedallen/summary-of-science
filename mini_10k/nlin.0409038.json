INTRODUCTION\n\nI\n\nN a competitive electricity market, increased demand\nelasticity can moderate suppliers' ability to exercise market\npower and alleviate excessive price volatility. Customer\nresponses to the market prices can be classified into four\ndifferent categories: curtailment [1], substitution [2], storage\n[3], and shifting. Load shifting, as the name implies, shifts\nelectric usage to pre- or post-peak periods to reduce\nconsumption during the anticipated peak-price periods. An\nimportant feature of the load shifting program is that it targets\nthe cyclic loads such as thermostatically controlled appliances\n(TCAs). TCAs include residential heating ventilation and air\nconditioning (HVAC) systems, electric water heaters, and\nrefrigerators. Varying the setting of a TCA thermostat can\nshift the TCA power consumption from tens of minutes to a\ncouple of hours, depending on the appliances. If the setpoint\nis controlled in response to the market prices, the shifted\nTCA's power consumption can contribute to load reduction\nduring the peak-price periods.\nTo evaluate the economic benefits of different load shifting\nstrategies, it is essential to model the change in TCA power\nconsumption as a function of setpoint changes in response to\nmarket prices. Load models developed for TCAs based on\n\nThis work is supported by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory\noperated for the U.S. Department of Energy by Battelle Memorial Institute\nunder contract DE-AC06-76RL01830.\nN.

Box 999,\nMSIN: K5-20, Richland, WA - 99352, USA (e-mail: ning.lu@pnl.gov,\ndavid.chassin@pnl.gov, steve.widergren@pnl.gov)\n\nstatistical analysis [4-7] of historical data can not model the\npower output of a TCA when the setpoint is controlled in\nresponse to market prices. A state queueing (SQ) model [8]\nwas proposed by Lu and Chassin to simulate aggregated TCA\nloads after their setpoint changes. This paper is a follow-up\npaper to the initial work done in [8], where TCAs are assumed\nto have the same size and are set at the same setpoint under\nsimilar ambient temperatures, leading to a simplified model\nthat only accounts for standby loss.\nHowever, in practice,\nTCA units have different sizes and the ambient temperatures\nvary in different regions. Furthermore, random customer\nusages will have significant impact on the power\nconsumptions of TCAs. In this paper, using a water heater\nmodel as an example, methodologies are developed to modify\nthe transition matrixes to account for the uncertainties in\nthermal parameters, the ambient temperatures, and the random\ncustomer behaviors, which are the key for the SQ model to\nsimulate aggregated TCA loads accurately. The impacts of\nconsidering the randomness in the model on the TCA setpoint\nresponse are also studied.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the\nSQ model. Section III describes uncertainties in thermal\nmodel parameters and presents the modified thermal model.\nCustomer random behaviors are discussed and modeled in\nSection IV. The impacts of combining the modeling of\nuncertainties on setpoint change response are discussed in\nSection V. Section VI provides conclusion.\nII. TCA THERMAL MODELS\nA. Thermal Characteristics of TCAs\nThermostatically controlled appliances include residential\nHVAC systems, electric water heaters, and refrigerators. Fig.\n1 shows the thermal behavior (temperature of stored water) of\na water heater unit over time. The rising curves indicate the\nwater heater is \"on\", and the falling curves represent the\nstandby (or cooling down) periods, when the heater is \"off\".\nAs the water heater unit cycles, the water temperature in the\ntank rises and falls accordingly [9].\nThe operations of other TCAs are similar. The upper and\nlower limits represent the dead band of the thermostat around\nthe thermostat setpoint, and changing the setpoint allows one\nto regulate the power consumption of the TCAs. Because the\nasymptotic equilibrium temperatures are generally far beyond\nthese limits for appropriately sized equipment, the exponential\nrising curve and falling curve are nearly linear between the\nupper limit and the lower limit, as shown in Fig. 1. To\n\n\fPNNL-SA-41229\nsimplify the analysis, a linear approximation of TCA thermal\ncharacteristics (Fig. 2) is used in our model. T+ and T\u2013 are the\nupper and lower temperature limit for a given setpoint T. The\nunit has a cycling time of \u03c4, with an \"on\" period of \u03c4on and an\n\"off\" period of \u03c4off.\n\n2\nstep 1, we will have nearly equal numbers of units in each of\nthe 20 states. At the end of each time step, units will move\none state ahead. For example, at time step 2, units in State 1\nwill move to State 2, units in State 2 to State 3, and units in\nState 20 to State 1, as shown in Table I.\nAssume the average power consumption of each unit is Pave.\nThe total load at each time step is simply the aggregated\npower output of all the \"on\" units in States 1 through 5.\nWhen the units are uniformly distributed among the states, the\nexpected load PL can be calculated as:\nE (PL ) = E ( N on )Pave =\n\nnon\n5\nNPave =\nNPave\nn\n20\n\nwhere n is the total number of states, non is the number of \"on\"\nstates, N is the number of units, and Non is the number of \"on\"\nunits.\n\nFig. 1: Differential models of controlled thermal behavior [9]\n\nFig. 3: The SQ model of aggregated water heater load\n\nFig. 2: The simplified thermal characteristic curve of a TCA\nB. A state queueing model [8]\nA SQ model describes a water heater behavior by tracking\nthe state of the water heater over time. Consider a system\ncontaining N water heater units with the initial thermal states\nshown in Fig. 3. As an illustration, consider a group of water\nheater units, whose \"on\" times are 5 minutes and \"off\" times\nare 15 minutes at a given ambient temperature and a given\nsetpoint. Note that in practice, water heaters usually have\ncycling times up to 10 hours (when there is no water draw).\nT+ and T\u2013 are the upper and lower temperature limits for a\ngiven setpoint T. A state is then defined by both the water\ntemperature in the tank and the on/off status of a unit. We\ndivide the time cycle into 20 states of equal duration such that\nthere are 5 distinct \"on\" states (shown by shaded boxes in Fig.\n3) and 15 distinct \"off\" states in a temperature range of [T\u2013,\nT+].\nInitially, we assume a uniformly diversified load, and the\nunits are distributed uniformly among all 20 states. If the\nwhole time period is divided into 20 time steps, then at time\n\nTable I shows the state evolution along the timeline. Rows\nrepresent time steps and columns represent the unit states.\nThe shaded states are the \"on\" states. One can calculate the\naggregated output by summing up the power consumption of\nall the units in the \"on\" states at each time step.\nFor example, if there is a 1-kW unit in each of the 20 states,\nthe aggregated consumption at any time is 5 kW because at\nany time, there are 5 \"on\" states in the system.\nTABLE I\nTHE STATE DISTRIBUTION OF THE WATER HEATER UNITS\nStates\n\ntime\n\nTime\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\n\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n1\n\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n1\n2\n\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n1\n2\n3\n\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n\n17\n18\n19\n20\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n\n18\n19\n20\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n\n19\n20\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n\n20\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n\n\fPNNL-SA-41229\n\n3\n\nIII. UNCERTAINTIES IN THE THERMAL MODELS OF TCAS\nA. Uncertainties in thermal model parameters\nThe thermal model we used is based on an equivalent\nthermal parameter (ETP) approach [11, 12]. An example ETP\nrepresentation of a water heater is shown in Fig. 4, where UA\nis the standby heat loss coefficient, C is the tank capacity, Tout\nis the ambient temperature, and Q is the heat rate of the water\nheater. Q is proportional to the heater rated power.\n\nthan the heat losses by design. Therefore, the value of UA\nwill have a minor influence on the rising curve (\u03c4on), where\nthe heater is on. When the heater is \"off\", Q is zero. Then, the\nheat loss determined by the UA of the water heater will\ndominate the length of the falling curve (\u03c4off).\nAs an illustration, consider 40 gallon water heaters rated at\n4.5 kW with their UA varying from 2.4 to 3.6 Btu/hr\u00b0F. If the\nambient temperature is 60\u00b0F, the calculated standby cycling\nperiods are shown in Fig. 5. As predicted, the \u03c4on values are\nalmost the same for all units, but the \u03c4off values scatter from 12\nhr to 18 hr.\nAt the feeder end, where the individual load aggregates, the\ndifferences in water heater cycling times caused by different\nUA of each unit result in an uncertainty in the aggregated\nthermal characteristic curve used to set up a SQ model.\nHowever, because UA is a deterministic parameter for each\nwater heater unit, its impact is time invariant.\n\nFig. 4: An ETP heat transfer model for a water heater\nBased on the ETP model, starting from an initial\ntemperature T0 and ignoring the hot water consumption, the\nwater temperature T can be calculated by\nT = (T0 \u2212\n\n(1)\n\nK 2 \u2212 K1t K 2\n)e\n+\nK1\nK1\n\nwhere K1 and K2 are calculated by\nK1 =\n\nUA\nC\n\nK 2 = Q + Tout\n\nUA\nC\n\nTo calculate \u03c4on, assuming T0=T\u2013 and T=T+ , we have\n\u03c4 on\n\nK \u239e\nQ\n\u239b\n\u239b\n\u2212 Tout\n\u239c T+ \u2212 2 \u239f\n\u239c T+ \u2212\nK1 \u239f\nK\n\u239c\n1\n= \u2212 ln\n/ K 1 = \u2212 ln\u239c\n\u239c\n\u239c\nK2 \u239f\nQ\n\u2212 Tout\n\u239c T\u2212 \u2212\n\u239f\n\u239c T\u2212 \u2212\nK1\nK1 \u23a0\n\u239d\n\u239d\n\n\u239e\n\u239f\n\u239f/ K\n\u239f 1\n\u239f\n\u23a0\n\n(2)\n\n2) Uncertainties caused by different ambient temperature\n\nWhen the heater is turned off, Q is zero.

The ambient temperatures vary\ndiurnally and seasonally from 30\u00b0F to 60\u00b0F. Note that this\nvariation is a temporal variation, and its influence is a function\nof time. Again the \u03c4on values change slightly while the \u03c4off\nvalues scatter around a range of a few hours.\n\nBased on (2) and (3), a sensitivity analysis can be\nperformed to study the impact of parameter uncertainties on\nTCA cycling times. The analysis can be readily extended to\nthe HVAC and the refrigerator models, which are similar to\nthe water heater model.\n1) The uncertainties in UA\nThe value of UA varies even for the same type and size\nwater heaters. To account for the variations, UA can be\nconsidered to follow a certain probability density function\n(PDF) in [UA-, UA+], such as a uniform or a normal\ndistribution.\nThe heat rate of a water heater Q usually is much greater\n\nFig. 6: The thermal characteristic curves of water heaters\nwith different ambient temperature\n\n\fPNNL-SA-41229\n\n4\n\nThis is because for water heaters, the dead band is small\ncompared with the value of T-Tout. Therefore, based on (2),\n\u03c4on will not change significantly with different Tout. Because\nthe ambient temperatures vary with time, the uncertainties are\ntime dependent.\nB. Modified thermal model of TCAs\nTaking into account the above uncertainties, the thermal\ncharacteristic curves for a group of TCAs are shown in Fig. 7.\nThe state that a unit resides in follows some probability\ndistribution function determined by the uncertainties brought\nby the different UAs and ambient temperatures. When the\nambient temperatures are high, there are more units having\nlonger cycling periods and vice versa. The probability\ndistribution will then be shifted accordingly, as shown in Fig.\n7. The uncertainties bring additional off-diagonal state\ntransition probabilities in the probability transition matrix P,\nas shown in Fig. 8. A SQ model considering the parameter\nuncertainties is shown in Fig. 9, where N is the total number\nof states, and Non is the number of \"on\" states.\n\nFig. 9: A modified SQ model considering the uncertainties\nof the TCA cycling time\nLet vector Xk = (x1, x2, .., xN) represent the number of units\nin each state at the kth time interval and P represent the\ntransition matrix [10] containing the transition probabilities\npi,j, which represents the probability of a unit moving from\nState i to State j. We can then calculate the state evolution\nfrom the k-1 to the kth time interval using\nX k = X k \u22121 P\n\n(4)\n\nThe aggregated power output PL is then calculated by\nN on\n\nPL = Pave \u2211 xm\n\n(5)\n\nm =1\n\nwhere Pave is the average power output of a unit, xm is the\nnumber of units in an \"on\" State m, and Non is the number of\nthe \"on\" states.\nTo account for the uncertainties, for units in State i, we\nhave\nN\n\n\u2211p\nj =1\n\nFig. 7: Uncertainties in thermal characteristic curves\n\ni, j\n\n=1\n\n(6)\n\nwhere pi,j follows certain PDF. For the 20-state transition\nprobability matrix P shown in Fig. 8, the unit residing in State\n6 has probabilities 0.2, 0.6, and 0.2, to remain in State 6 or\nmove forward to State 7 or 8. This shows that 20% of all units\nhave slower or faster temperature decay rates than the\nmajority, 60%.\nIn the next section, the impacts of customer random\nbehaviors on aggregated TCA load curves are discussed.\nIV. UNCERTAINTIES CAUSED BY RANDOM CUSTOMER\nBEHAVIORS\n\nFig. 8: Uncertainties in state transition matrix \u03a1\n\nCustomer behaviors can have a significant impact on the\ncycling time of TCAs. Based on load surveys, such as the\nEnd-Use Load and Consumer Assessment Program (ELCAP)\ndata collected by the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA)\n[13], PDFs of diurnal, weekly, and annual load profiles can be\nobtained.\nFig. 10a shows a SQ model that takes customer hot water\nconsumptions into account. Minor consumption is defined as a\nsmall amount of water draw, causing the water temperature to\ndrop slightly. Because the temperature drops when the unit is\non are not as significant as the temperature drops when the\nunit is off, the minor consumption can be modeled by adding\n\n\fPNNL-SA-41229\n\n5\n\npi,i+m (m = 2, 3, ...) entries for the \"off\" states and a pi,i entry\nfor the \"on\" states in P (Fig. 10b). A major consumption is\ndefined as a large amount of hot water draw, which will cause\nthe water temperature to drop below the lower temperature\nlimit. The heater will then turn on. This kind of consumption\ncan be modeled by putting a link between each state to State 1,\nas shown in Fig. 10b.\nA transition matrix P corresponding to the SQ model shown\nin Fig. 10b is\n\u23a1 p1,1 1\u2212 p1,1\n\u23a4\n\u23a2p\n\u23a5\n\u2212\n\u2212\n1\np\np\np\n2\n,\n1\n2\n,\n2\n2\n,\n1\n2\n,\n2\n\u23a2\n\u23a5\n\u23a2 ...\n\u23a5\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\u23a2\n\u23a5\nP= \u23a2pNon,1\npNon,Non 1\u2212 pNon,1 \u2212 pNon,Non\n\u23a5\n\u23a2 ...\n...\n... \u23a5\n\u23a2\n\u23a5\n1\u2212 pi,1 \u2212 pi,i+2 \u2212... pi,i+2 pi,i+3 ...\u23a5\n\u23a2 pi,1\n\u23a2 1\n\u23a5\n\u23a3\n\u23a6\n\nwhere pi,j can be adjusted to account for the different\nconsumption patterns. Note that pi,j is a function of time\nbecause the consumption of hot water varies by time-of-day.\n\nconsumptions and minor consumptions.\nA major\nconsumption includes behaviors such as washing dishes,\ntaking showers, and washing clothes, which usually last for\nmore than 5 minutes. A minor consumption includes\nbehaviors such as washing hands and washing fruit, which\nusually last for 1 or 2 minutes.\nFig. 11 shows the ELCAP data curve versus the simulation\ndata curve obtained using a 60-state SQ model with the\nprobability curves shown in Fig. 12. The probability of major\nand minor consumptions during a winter weekday is\ncalibrated by ELCAP data. To tune the P matrix, we first\nestimate the probability of a minor consumption event based\non consumption patterns. Then, we tune the major event\nprobability to do the curve fitting. The calibration of the\ntransition matrix P to account for the parameter uncertainties\nfollows an interval mathematics approach, because all\nvariations of input parameters are simultaneously considered\nand reflected in our calibrated P matrix with an assumption\nthat all possible values for a parameter must lie somewhere\nwithin the assumed interval for the parameter [14]. Because an\neigenvalue analysis on the P matrix shows that the pi,1 entries\nhave a dominant impact on the steady-state distribution of the\nunit in each state for water heater case, the load profile\nfollows the shape of the probability of major consumption\nevents, as shown in Fig. 11 and Fig. 12.\n\n(a) The modified state queue\n\nFig. 11: Winter load profile for electric water heater load:\nELCAP data versus simulation result\n\n(b) The modified state transition matrix P\nFig. 10: The modified SQ model considering customer\nconsumptions\nTo tune the state transition probability pi,j, we use the data\ncollected in ELCAP by BPA in our simulation.

IMPACTS ON SETPOINT CHANGE RESPONSE OF TCAS\nWith a change in the setpoint, the upper temperature limit\nand the lower temperature limit of a TCA thermostat setting\nare shifted. Therefore, a unit may turn on/off accordingly, and\nelectricity consumption is pre-consumed or deferred.\nHowever, the total energy consumed in 1 day remains the\nsame.\n\nA. The impact of uncertainties in load cycling times\nAssume a fixed dead band during a setpoint change. When\nthe market price drops, we expect a setpoint to increase, as\nshown in Fig. 13, which results in moving all units to below\nthe new lower temperature limit. Therefore, the units that are\n\"off\" before the change of setpoint will turn on. Using a 20state SQ model with 5 \"on\" states as an example and\nconsidering 10,000 units distributed uniformly along the 20\nstates, the average number of \"on\" unit is 2,500. Considering\nonly standby losses of the units, an oscillation on the\naggregated load curve will be caused by a setpoint increase, as\nshown by the dotted line in Fig. 14. The detail of this\noscillation has been analyzed in [8] using a TCA standby\nmodel.\nTemperature (F)\n\nT'+\n\nNew Upper Limit\n\nT'\n\nNew Setpoint\n\nT'-\n\nNew Lower Limit\n\nT+\nT\nT-\n\n\u03c4\n\n\u03c4+\u2206\u03c4off\n\nTime\n\nFig. 13: A setpoint increase\nIn reality, the 10,000 units will not have exactly the same\ncycling time because of the differences in UAs and ambient\ntemperatures. Using the modified transition matrix P shown in\nFig. 8 to account for these uncertainties, the aggregated TCA\nresponse curve will then follow the solid line in Fig. 14. We\nnote following observations:\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nThe initial peak is the same as that of the nouncertainty case.\nThe succeeding peaks are damped.\nThe oscillation frequencies are different.\n\nThis is because the setpoint change basically will\nsynchronize the units that are \"off\" with units that are \"on\"\nand form a dynamic oscillation with a frequency of 1/\u03c4. The\nuncertainties in \u03c4 will cause a spectrum of oscillation\nfrequency within [1/\u03c4 1/(\u03c4+\u03c4off)]. Therefore, the aggregated\nload peaks will be the highest initially. After that, because of\nthe frequency differences, the aggregated load peaks will be\nless than the initial one. The more diverse the unit cycling\ntimes are, the faster the aggregated load peaks are damped.\n\nFig. 14: The number of units in \"on\" state after a setpoint\nincrease considering uncertainties in \u03c4\n\nB. The impact of uncertainties in random load behaviors\nThe uncertainties in load cycling times are uncertainties in\naggregated load behaviors. For each individual TCA unit, the\ncycling time is deterministic for a given ambient temperature.\nHowever, load consumptions are different. Random demand\nmay vary the cycling time of a TCA unit by randomly\nshortening the \"off\" cycle or by prolonging the \"on\" cycle,\nthereby increasing the effective duty cycle and bringing\ndiversity to the water heater loads.\nThe 20-state water heater SQ model with 5 \"on\" states is\nagain used for illustration purpose. The probability matrix\nshown in Fig. 10b is used to account for the customer\nconsumptions. The setpoint increase response curve is shown\nin Fig. 15.\nAs discussed in Section IV, demand varies with respect to\ntime. During night hours, both the major and the minor\ncustomer consumptions may be so infrequent that the\nprobabilities of both can be considered to be zero. If a\nsetpoint increase response is considered, we would expect the\npower consumption to follow curve 1 in Fig. 15. In the\nmorning hours, people frequently use hot water and both the\nminor and major consumptions happen with high\nprobabilities. If using the P matrix listed in Fig. 10b, the\nresponse will follow curve 2 in Fig. 15. During daytime,\nwhen people go to work, the hot water consumption may be\nless frequent. Assuming that the state transition probabilities\nfor major consumptions change from 0.1 to 0.01 in Fig. 10,\nthe response will follow curve 3 in Fig. 15. The setpoint\ndecrease responses for the three scenarios are shown in Fig.\n16.\nThere are several observations based on the results:\n\u2022 Demand raises the average power output because the\neffective duty cycle is shorter than the standby\nmodel.\n\u2022 Demand damps the load peaks after a setpoint\nincrease and benefits the system by restoring the load\ndiversity over time.\n\u2022 As shown in Fig. 17, demand shortens the load\nshifting time obtained by lowering the setpoint. This\n\n\fPNNL-SA-41229\nmay have a negative impact on load shifting\nprograms because the load may not be able to be\nshifted away from the peak-price periods totally.\n\nFig. 15: The number of units in \"on\" state after a setpoint\nincrease considering customer consumption\n\nFig. 16: The number of units in \"on\" state after a setpoint\ndecrease considering the customer consumptions\n\nFig. 17: Setpoint increase responses based on ELCAP data\nFig. 17 gives a simulation result using an ELCAP data\ntuned transition matrix. Assume that when prices drop, the\nsetpoints of water heaters will be raised. Then, consider a\nprice drop happens at 1 a.m. The dotted line shows the load\noscillations after this price drop, if there is no customer\nconsumption through a day. In real life, around 6 a.m., the\n\n7\nincreased hot water consumptions start to diffuse the\nsynchronized loads and restore the original system diversity.\nIf the price drop happens at 12 noon, when the minor\nconsumptions are high but the major consumptions are low,\nthen there is a small but observable oscillation in the load\nprofile.\nThis is because the many minor hot water\nconsumptions damp the oscillation. If setpoints are raised at 6\na.m., when both the major and minor hot water consumptions\nare frequent, we do not observe this oscillation because the\ndamping rate is high. By calculating the eigenvalues of the\ntransition matrix P, one can then find out how fast load\nconsumptions can damp the load oscillations caused by\nsignificant price drops or increases if the TCA setpoints are\nset to respond to price changes. The study can indicate\nwhether or not distribution networks implementing such\ndemand-side management strategies are overloaded under\nthose circumstances and for how long.\n\nC. The Combining Impacts\nFig. 18 shows four cases of setpoint decrease responses.\nThe solid lines are the responses considering both parameter\nuncertainties and the customer consumptions at different\nPDFs. The dotted lines show the cases considering only the\ncustomer consumptions.\nThe results indicate that, although the randomness of the\nload cycling times and the customer consumptions both\ncontribute to restore load diversities after a setpoint response,\ncustomer consumptions have a dominant impact. This is\nbecause higher customer consumptions mean faster diffusion\nprocesses between states. A sensitivity analysis on the\neigenvalues and eigenvectors of the transition matrix P will\nalso show that the higher the probability of customer\nconsumptions, the higher the damping rates.\n\nFig. 18: The number of units in \"on\" state after a setpoint\ndecrease (combining uncertainty impacts)\n\nD. A comparison with physically unit-based simulation\napproach\nPower Distribution System Simulator (PDSS) [9] is a\nsoftware simulation tool developed by Pacific Northwest\nNational Laboratory (PNNL). PDSS is a detailed physically\nbased simulation at the unit level, meaning that each water\n\n\fPNNL-SA-41229\n\n8\n\nheater is simulated by a thermal model with its own set of\nparameters. Then, a load synthesis is done to get the\naggregated load curve. Therefore, the uncertainties are\naccounted for at the unit level. The SQ model is a state-based\nmodel and it is an aggregated model. The uncertainties are\naccounted for at the system level. A comparison of results\nobtained by using software developed under the two different\napproaches is depicted in Fig. 19. The two software tools are\nfirst tuned by ELCAP data. Then they are used to simulate the\nload response to a setpoint decrease happening at 1 p.m.\nfollowed by a setpoint increase at 1 a.m. the next day.\n\ndistribution functions of the cycling time and consumer\nbehavior patterns can be obtained. State transition matrixes\nfor each hour can then be tuned and used by the SQ model\nintroduced in [8] to simulate the price response of loads\naggregated by TCAs. The eigenvalues of the state transition\nmatrix can be used to evaluate the system damping rate, which\nindicates the ability of the system to restore load diversity.\nBecause the computation time of a SQ model is determined by\nthe number of states used to model the TCA load cycling\nperiods and the sparsity of the state transition matrix, it has\ncomputational advantages over unit-based simulation, thus\nholding promise as an useful equivalent load model for\ntransmission level studies.\nOur future work will focus on setting up the setpoint\ncontrol functions, which govern setpoint responses to market\nprices. By evaluating the payments and resulting load\nprofiles, the economic benefits and technical impacts of\ndifferent control functions can then be evaluated.\nREFERENCES\n[1]\n\n[2]\n\nFig. 19: A result comparison between PDSS and SQ model\nFrom the result, we notice that\n\u2022 The responses are similar, although the magnitude\nand the phase may have some deviations. Because\nPDSS accounts for uncertainties at the unit level, the\naggregated load obtained is more diversified than the\nSQ model. The synchronized load peaks obtained by\nPDSS are lower.\n\u2022 Compared with PDSS, the SQ model is easier to be\ntuned to follow a load curve exactly. This is because\nthe input of the PDSS is at the unit level, and the\naggregated load response at the system level is not\nfully controllable by the inputs.\n\u2022 When the population size becomes larger, for\nexample, if a feeder with thousands of water heaters\nis simulated, the SQ model computes much faster\nbecause the computation time of a SQ model is\nsensitive to the number of states, but not to the total\nnumber of units.\nBecause the two simulation approaches reach similar results\nwith same inputs, it serves as a validation for both models. To\nsummarize, the PDSS model shows more load diversity and\nhas a better representation of peak load. The SQ model is\ncomputationally faster, although it yields a higher load peak\nwith a faster damping rate.\n\n[3]\n\n[4]\n\n[5]\n\n[6]\n\n[7]\n\n[8]\n\n[9]\n\n[10]\n[11]\n\n[12]\n\n[13]\n\nVI.
