[1] \u2013 are the famous\nBell inequalities. On the other hand there is currently\na huge business to develop entanglement measures using\nthe quantum physics tools: Hilbert space, observables\nand tensor products. A lot of different measures have\nbeen proposed so far and only for bipartite qubit systems the problem is satisfactorily solved. Yet, very recently a third approach has been proposed: asking how\nhuge can non\u2013local correlations be only assuming nonsignaling (no faster\u2013than\u2013light communication). Or differently stated: why is Nature not more non\u2013local than\npredicted by quantum theory, e.g. Ref. [2, 3].\nThe purpose of this Letter is to shed light on the features of nonlocality and entanglement for massive meson\u2013\nantimeson systems, in particular for the neutral kaon\u2013\nantikaon system. The neutral K-mesons or simply kaons\nare bound states of quarks and anti\u2013quarks or more precis\nthe strangeness state +1, K 0 , is composed of an anti\u2013\nstrange quark and a down quark and the strangeness\nstate \u22121, K\u0304 0 , is composed of a strange and anti\u2013down\nquark.\nInterestingly, also for strange mesons entangled states\ncan be obtained, in analogy to the entangled spin up and\ndown pairs, or H and V polarized photon pairs. Such\nstates are produced by e+ e\u2212 \u2013colliders through the reaction e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03a6 \u2192 K 0 K\u0304 0 , in particular at DA\u03a6NE in\nFrascati, or they are produced in pp\u0304\u2013collisions, like, e.g.,\nat LEAR at CERN. There, a K 0 K\u0304 0 pair is described at\nthe time t = 0 by the entangled antisymmetric Bell state,\n1 \b\n|\u03c8 \u2212 i = \u221a |K 0 il \u2297 |K\u0304 0 ir \u2212 |K\u0304 0 il \u2297 |K 0 ir , (1)\n2\nwhere l denotes the particle moving to the left hand side\nand r the particle moving to the right hand side.\n\nAnalogously to entangled photon systems for these systems Bell inequalities can be derived, i.e. the most general Bell inequality of the CHSH\u2013type is given by (see\nRef. [4])\nSkn ,km ,kn\u2032 ,km\u2032 (t1 , t2 , t3 , t4 ) =\nEkn ,km (t1 , t2 ) \u2212 Ekn ,km\u2032 (t1 , t3 )\n\n+|Ekn\u2032 ,km (t4 , t2 ) + Ekn\u2032 ,km\u2032 (t4 , t3 )| \u2264 2 . (2)\n\nHere Alice can choose on the kaon propagating to her left\nhand side the \"quasi\u2013spin\", i.e. a certain superposition\nof kaon and antikaon |kn i = \u03b1|K 0 i + \u03b2|K\u0304 0 i, and how\nlong the kaon propagates, the time t. The same options\nare given to Bob for the kaon propagating to the right\nhand side. As in the usual photon setup, Alice and Bob\ncan choose among two settings. The expectation value\nEkn ,km (t1 , t2 ) denotes then that Alice chooses to measure\nthe quasi\u2013spin kn at time t1 on the kaon propagating to\nher side and Bob chooses to measure km at time t2 on\nhis kaon.\nWe notice now already that in the neutral kaon case\nwe have more options than in the photon case, we can\nvary in the quasi\u2013spin space or vary the detection times\nor both.\nLet us first choose all times equal to zero and choose\nthe quasi\u2013spin states kn = KS , km = K\u0304 0 , kn\u2032 = km\u2032 =\nK10 where KS is the short\u2013lived eigenstate, one eigenstate of the time evolution, and K10 is the CP plus eigenstate. Here C stands for charge conjugation and P for\nparity. The neutral kaon system is known for violating\nthe combined transformation CP. In Ref. [5] the authors\nshow that after optimizing the Bell inequality (BI) can\nbe turned into\n\u03b4\u22640\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03b4 is the CP violating parameter in mixing. Experimentally, \u03b4 corresponds to the leptonic asymmetry of\nkaon decays which is measured to be \u03b4 = (3.27 \u00b1 0.12) *\n10\u22123 . This value is in clear contradiction to the value\nrequired by the BI above, i.e. by the premises of local realistic theories. In this sense the violation of a symmetry\n\n\f2\nin high energy physics is connected to the violation of a\nBell inequality, i.e. to nonlocality[26]. This is clearly not\nthe case for photons, they do not violate the CP symmetry. Moreover, the CP violating parameter is measured\nfor single states, but it nevertheless gives information on\nbipartite states.\nAlthough the BI (3) is as loophole free as possible,\nthe probabilities or expectations values involved are not\ndirectly measurable, because experimentally there is no\nway to distinguish the short\u2013lived state KS from the CP\nplus state K10 directly.\nIn this work we want to investigate another choice for\nthe Bell inequality (2), i.e. all quasispins are equal to\nthose for K\u0304 0 , and we are going to vary all four times\nSK\u0304 0 ,K\u0304 0 ,K\u0304 0 ,K\u0304 0 (t1 , t2 , t3 , t4 ) =\n|EK\u0304 0 ,K\u0304 0 (t1 , t2 ) \u2212 EK\u0304 0 ,K\u0304 0 (t1 , t3 )|\n\n+|EK\u0304 0 ,K\u0304 0 (t4 , t2 ) + EK\u0304 0 ,K\u0304 0 (t4 , t3 )| \u2264 2 . (4)\n\nThis has the advantage that it can in principle be tested\nin experiments: Alice and Bob insert at a certain distance\nfrom the source (corresponding to the detection times)\na piece of matter forcing the incoming neutral kaon to\nreact. Because the strong interaction is strangeness conserving one obtains via the reaction products if the incoming kaon is an antikaon or not. Note that different\nto photons a N O event does not mean that the incoming\nkaon is a K 0 but also includes the case that it could have\ndecayed before. In principle, the strangeness content can\nalso be obtained via decay modes, but Alice and Bob have\nno way to force their kaon to decay at a certain time, the\ndecay mechanism is a spontaneous event. However, a\nnecessary condition to refute any local realistic theory\nare active measurements, i.e. exerting the free will of the\nexperimenter (for more details consult Ref. [6]).\nOur question is: Can we violate the Bell\u2013CHSH\ninequality sensitive to strangeness (4) for a certain initial state and what is the maximum value?\nThe first naive guess would be yes. In Refs. [4, 6] the\nauthors studied the problem for the initial maximally entangled Bell state, Eq. (1), and they found that a value\ngreater than 2 cannot be reached, i.e. one cannot refute any local realistic theory. The reason is that the\nparticle\u2013antiparticle oscillation is too slow compared to\nthe decay or vice versa, i.e., the ratio of oscillation to\ndecay x = \u2206m\n\u0393 is about 1 for kaons and not 2 necessary\nfor a formal violation. A different view is that the decay\nproperty acts as a kind of \"decoherence\", as we will show.\nFrom decoherence studies we know that some states are\nmore \"robust\" against a certain kind of decoherence than\nothers, this leads to the question if another maximally entangled Bell state or maybe a different initial state would\nlead to a violation.\nFor that let us study first how single neutral kaons are\nhandled via open quantum systems and then proceed to\nentangled kaons and discuss their entanglement and pu-\n\nrity properties which gives us an insight in the behavior\nof this strange two-state system. The formalism also enables us to calculate the correct expectation values for\narbitrary initial states needed for the Bell inequality (4).\nDifferent kinds of Bell inequalities are discussed e.g. in\nRefs. [7, 8, 9] and also decoherence models can be investigated, e.g. Refs. [10, 11], and the model proposed in\nthe former reference has recently been tested via experimental data Refs. [12, 13].\n\nOPEN QUANTUM FORMALISM OF DECAYING\nSYSTEMS\n\nNeutral kaons are a decaying two\u2013state system due to\nthe particle\u2013antiparticle oscillation in time and are usually described via an effective Schr\u00f6dinger equation which\nwe write in the Liouville von Neumann form\nd\n\u2020\n\u03c1ss = \u2212i Hef f \u03c1ss + i \u03c1ss Hef\nf\ndt\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03c1ss is a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix and the Hamiltonian\nHef f is non-Hermitian. Using the Wigner-Weisskopfapproximation the effective Hamilton can be calculated\nto be Hef f = H \u2212 2i \u0393 where the mass matrix H and the\ndecay matrix \u0393 are both Hermitian and positive. Here\nthe weak interaction Hamiltonian responsible for decay\nis treated as a perturbation and interactions between the\nfinal states are neglected. This Wigner-Weisskopf approximation gives the exponential time evolution of the\ntwo diagonal states of Hef f :\n|KS/L (t)i = e\u2212imS/L t e\u2212\n\n\u0393S/L\n2\n\nt\n\n|KS/L i ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere mS/L and \u0393S/L are the masses and decay constants for the short/long\u2013lived state KS/L (\u0393S \u2248 600\u0393L ;\n\u2206m = mL \u2212 mS \u2243 \u0393S /2). A kaon with strangeness\n+1 (kaon) or \u22121 (antikaon) is a superposition of the\ntwo mass\u2013eigenstates, i.e. |K 0 i \u2243 \u221a12 {|KS i + |KL i} and\n|K\u0304 0 i \u2243 \u221a12 {\u2212|KS i + |KL i}. Here the small CP violation\nis safely neglected throughout the Letter. What makes\nthe neutral kaon systems so attractive for many physical\nanalyzes is the huge factor between the two decay rates,\ni.e. \u0393S \u2248 600\u0393L , and that the strangeness oscillation is\n\u2206m = mL \u2212 mS \u2243 \u0393S /2.\nConsidering Eq. (6) we notice that the state is not\nnormalized for t > 0. Indeed, we are not describing a\nsystem, for t > 0 a neutral kaon has a surviving and\ndecaying component. In Ref. [14] the authors show that\nby enlarging the original two\u2013dimensional Hilbert space\nby at least two further dimensions representing the decay\nproduct states, the non\u2013Hermitian part of Hef f can be\nincorporated into the dissipator of the enlarged space via\na Lindblad operator. Thus the time evolution of neutral\nkaons is described by an open quantum formalism, in\n\n\f3\ndecay is caused by the environment (treating the neutral\nkaon in QFT formalism, the decay would be caused by\nthe QCD vacuum). The surviving part of the single kaon\nevolving in time is represented by the upper 2 \u00d7 2 block\nmatrix \u03c1ss , the lower one by the decaying part \u03c1f f .\nOnly properties of the surviving components can be\nmeasured. E.g. by a piece of matter an incoming beam is\nforced to react with the matter via the strong interaction\n(which is strangeness conserving). If a reaction which can\nonly be caused by a K\u0304 0 is detected, one records a yes\u2013\nevent (Y). If no K\u0304 0 is detected a no\u2013event (N) is recorded\n(including a K 0 or a decay event). Then matter acts in\nthe very same manner as an ordinary polarisator for photons. Note that an experimenter can actively choose the\ninitial state (up to experimental realization), the kind of\ndetector (experimentally very limited) and where to place\nthe detector, i.e. how much \"decoherence\" the system\nundergoes, whereas the kind of \"decoherence\" is given\nby Nature. Note that this \"decoherence\" is fundamentally different from that in other quantum systems which\nare stable, there the kind of decoherence depends on the\nenvironment, for kaons it is intrinsic to the system.\nConsequently, an operator P projecting onto the states\n\u03c1ss gives the two probabilities, for Y or N , that a certain\nstate is detected at time t:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nP 0\nP rob(Y, t) = T r(\n\u03c1(t)) = T r(P \u03c1ss (t)) and\n0 0\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\u2212P 0\nP rob(N, t) = T r(\n0\n1 \u03c1(t))\n\nparticular by a master equation [15, 16]\nd\n\u03c1 = \u2212i[H, \u03c1] \u2212 D[\u03c1]\ndt\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the dissipator under the assumption of complete\npositivity and Markovian\nP dynamics has the well known\n\u2212 2Aj \u03c1A\u2020j ).\ngeneral form D[\u03c1] = 12 j (A\u2020j Aj \u03c1 + \u03c1A\u2020j AjL\nThe density matrix \u03c1 lives on Htot = Hs Hf where\ns and f denote \"surviving\" and \"decaying\" or \"final\"\ncomponents, and it has the following decomposition\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c1ss \u03c1sf\n\u03c1=\n(8)\n\u03c1\u2020sf \u03c1f f\nwhere \u03c1ij with i, j = s, f denote 2 \u00d7 2 matrices.

This leaves a certain ambiguity in defining the decaying components and\ntherefore purity and entanglement. We choose the off diagonal elements of \u03c1f f in Eq. (12) equal to zero because\nthey give the lowest purity values.\nLet us now consider the change of the properties of the\nstate \u03c1(t) with time by considering the purity defined by\nT r\u03c1(t)2 = T r(\u03c1ss (t)2 ) + T r(\u03c1f f (t)2 )\n= T r\u03c1ss (t)2 + (T r\u03c1f f (t))2\n= T r\u03c1ss (t)2 + (1 \u2212 T r\u03c1ss (t))2\n\n(12)\n\n\u221a\n\n\u0393S \u0393L\n(1 \u2212\nwith FS/L = 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u0393S/L t and X = \u2212i\u2206m\u2212\u0393\n\u2212i\u2206mt\u2212\u0393t\ne\n)\u03c1SL .

Again our definition of the purity is\nonly depending on the surviving components. Starting\nwith an arbitrary initial pure state we see that the decay ability of the system leads to a decrease in purity for\nt > 0. For KS or KL the purity returns to 1 for t \u2192 \u221e\ndepending on the decay constants, see Fig. 1. After a\ntime t/\u03c4S/L = ln 2 the minimal purity of 0.5 of a usual\nqubit system described by a 2 \u00d7 2 density matrix (trace\nstate) is reached. For other superpositions the purity oscillates to a certain final purity which 6= 1. For an initial\nK 0 or K\u0304 0 we reach the minimal purity of 0.375 at time\nt/\u03c4S = 401.881, i.e. about 2/3 of the lifetime of the long\u2013\nlived state. This is much lower than the purity of a qubit\nsystem. Indeed, this decaying system-where only two\ndegrees of freedom can be measured-behaves as regards\nthe purity properties as a system with more degrees of\nfreedom, neutral kaons are more like a double slit evolving in time, see Ref. [17]. Clearly, we could renormalize\nthe purity by choosing appropriate off diagonal elements\nof \u03c1f f .\nThe minimal purity which can be reached for this\ndecaying system is 0.333068 obtained by an initially\nmixed state (\u03c1SS = 2/3; \u03c1SL = 0; t/\u03c4S = 0.694012), and\nis thus greater than 0.25, the minimal value for a 4 \u00d7 4\ndensity matrix (trace state). Note that in general it\ndepends on the ratio between \u0393S /\u0393L and is therefore\nintrinsic to the described meson system.\n\nTHE TIME EVOLUTION FOR TWO KAONS\n\nAny density matrix of a single kaon evolving in time,\nEq. (12), can be decomposed in the following way\n\u03c1(t) =\n\nX\nnm\n\nfnm (t)\u03c1nm |nihm| .\n\nClearly, for two kaons in a product state we have\nX\n\u03c3(t) =\nfnm (t)flk (t)\u03c1nm \u03c1lk |nihm| \u2297 |lihk| ,\nnmlk\n\nand, consequently, any two\u2013kaon state is then given by\nX\n\u03c3(t) =\nfnm (t)flk (t)\u03c3nmlk |nihm| \u2297 |lihk| , (13)\nnmlk\n\nwhere the time dependent weights can be assumed to\nfactorize. In order to do this one has to prove that the\nprojectors commute with the generators of the time evolution under the trace (this was proven in a different formulation in Ref. [18]). We can even define a two\u2013particle\ndensity matrix depending on the two different times representing the times when the two kaons are measured,\ni.e.\n\u03c3(tl , tr ) = diag{\u03c3ssss (tl , tr ), \u03c3ssf f (tl , tr ),\n\u03c3f f ss (tl , tr ), \u03c3f f f f (tl , tr )} ,\nwhere \u03c3iijj are 4 \u00d7 4 matrices. As a measure of entanglement we want to consider the entanglement\nof formation\nP\nwhich is defined by EoF (\u03c1) = mini i pi S(T rl (|\u03c8i ih\u03c8i |))\nwhere S is the von Neumann entropy, the trace is taken\nover one subsystem (left or right) and \u03c8i are the pure\nstate decompositions of \u03c1. A necessary criterion for entanglement is that the matrix under partial transposition\n(P T ) has at least one negative eigenvalue. Only for bipartite two\u2013level systems P T is also sufficient for detecting all entangled states. For the density matrix under\ninvestigation P T acts in the following way\nP T [\u03c3(tl , tr )] = diag{P T [\u03c3ssss (tl , tr )], P T [\u03c3ssf f (tl , tr )],\nP T [\u03c3f f ss (tl , tr )], P T [\u03c3f f f f (tl , tr )]} .\nThe surviving\u2013surviving block \u03c3ssss can lead to negative\neigenvalues, i.e. can be entangled, while the eigenvalues\nof the other blocks cannot become negative due to the\nvanishing off diagonal elements, the eigenvalues remain\n\n\f5\n1\n2\n\n1.5\n\nConcurrence\n\nS @t,t,0,0D\n\n1.75\n\nS @t,t,0,0D\n\n1.25\n1\n\nMEMS\n\n0.8\n\nWerner states\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n0.75\n\nS @0,0,t,tD\n\n0.5\n\n0\n0.2\n\n0\n\n(a)\n\n4\n\n2\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nPurity\n\n1\n\n1\nMEMS\n\n0.8\n\nWerner states\n\nConcurrence\n\nConcurrence\n\n0.4\n\n(b)\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\nMEMS\n\n0.8\n\nWerner states\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nPurity\n\n(c)\n\n0.2\n\n(d)\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nPurity\n\nFIG. 2: (Colour online) In Fig.(a) is shown the timedependent S\u2013function for \u03c6+ (dashed, red ), \u03be (long dashed, blue) and\n\u0393S\n\u03c7 (solid, black ) (time in units of [ \u2206m\n]). For \u03be the violation exists up to 1/\u0393L . In Fig. (b)-(d) a purity versus concurrence\ndiagram is drawn (purity normalized (dT r\u03c12 \u2212 1)/(d \u2212 1) with d = 4 for bipartite qubits and d = 16 for bipartite kaons).\nThe limiting curve represents the maximally entangled mixed bipartite qubit states (MEMS) [22] and the nearly linear curve\n(dashed, purple) the Werner states for bipartite qubits. The dots are drawn for different initial states and the time proceeds\nfrom 0 to 100 with a step width of 0.05 (units as above). The smallest dots (red ) for \u03c6+ , next to smallest dots (blue) \u03be and the\nbiggest dots (black ) are for \u03c7. In Fig.(b) is shown the change in purity and concurrence for tl = tr = t, in (c) for tl = 0; tr = t\nand in (d) for tl = 0.3; tr = t.\n\nunchanged under P T . Thus whether the state under investigation is entangled depends only on \u03c3ssss . For 4 \u00d7 4\nmatrices entanglement of formation is an increasing function of the computable concurrence C, found by Hill and\nWootters Ref. [19][27]. Thus we can measure entanglement by the concurrence of \u03c3ssss .\nTo compute concurrence one defines the flipped ma\u2217\ntrix \u03c3\u0303ssss = (\u03c3y \u2297 \u03c3y )\u03c3ssss\n(\u03c3y \u2297 \u03c3y ) where \u03c3y is the y\u2013\nPauli matrix and the complex conjugation is taken in the\nKS KL basis. The concurrence is then given by the formula C = max{0, \u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bb3 \u2212 \u03bb4 } where the \u03bbi 's are\nthe square roots of the eigenvalues, in decreasing order,\nof the matrix \u03c3ssss \u03c3\u0303ssss .\nLet us now consider a general pure state at t = 0 (with\nr12 + r22 + r32 + r42 = 1 ; \u2297 omitted)\n|\u03c8(0)i = r1 ei\u03c61 |KS i|KS i + r2 ei\u03c62 |KS i|KL i\n+r3 e\n\ni\u03c63\n\n|KL i|KS i + r4 e\n\ni\u03c64\n\n|KL i|KL i . (14)\n\nAlice and Bob perform their measurements at certain\ntimes tl , tr , respectively. For a general initial pure state\nthe concurrence is derived to be\nC(\u03c3ssss (tl , tr )) = 2 |r1 r4 ei\u03c61 +i\u03c64 \u2212r2 r3 ei\u03c62 +i\u03c63 | e\u2212\u0393(tl +tr ) .\n\nIt is simply the concurrence of the initial pure state multiplied by the time depending damping factor. For one\ntime equal to zero the decrease in entanglement is lowest.\nWe choose as projectors Pr,l = |K\u0304 0 ihK\u0304 0 |, and the expectation value becomes after a cumbersome calculation\nEK\u0304 0 ,K\u0304 0 (tl , tr ) = 1 + r12 e\u2212\u0393S (tl +tr ) + r22 e\u2212\u0393S tl \u2212\u0393L tr\n+r32 e\u2212\u0393L tl \u2212\u0393S tr + r42 e\u2212\u0393L (tl +tr )\n\u2212r12 (e\u2212\u0393S tl + e\u2212\u0393S tr ) \u2212 r22 (e\u2212\u0393S tl + e\u2212\u0393L tr )\n\n\u2212r32 (e\u2212\u0393L tl + e\u2212\u0393S tr ) \u2212 r42 (e\u2212\u0393L tl + e\u2212\u0393L tr )\n+2 r1 r2 (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u0393S tl ) cos(\u2206mtr + \u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 ) e\u2212\u0393tr\n\n+2 r1 r3 cos(\u2206mtl + \u03c61 \u2212 \u03c63 ) e\u2212\u0393tl (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u0393S tr )\n\n+2 r2 r4 cos(\u2206mtl + \u03c62 \u2212 \u03c64 ) e\u2212\u0393tl (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u0393L tr )\n+2 r3 r4 (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u0393L tl ) cos(\u2206mtr + \u03c63 \u2212 \u03c64 ) e\u2212\u0393tr\n\n+2 r1 r4 cos(\u2206m(tl + tr ) + \u03c61 \u2212 \u03c64 ) e\u2212\u0393(tl +tr )\n+2 r2 r3 cos(\u2206m(tl \u2212 tr ) + \u03c62 \u2212 \u03c63 ) e\u2212\u0393(tl +tr ) .(15)\nWe notice that for any initial state one always has damping functions from the decay property in this system different from other two\u2013state systems and the expectation\nvalue converges for both times to infinity to +1. For the\n\n\f6\ninitial maximally entangled Bell states \u03c6\u00b1 (r2 = r3 = 0)\nthe oscillation goes with the sum of the times, different\nfrom the maximally entangled Bell states \u03c8 \u00b1 (r1 = r4 =\n0) where the oscillation only depends on the difference of\nthe times. Thus for \u03c6\u00b1 a violation of the Bell inequality\nwould occur earlier. However, it turns out that for no\nmaximally entangled state a violation can be found by\nnumerically optimizing with different standard methods\n(none guarantees a global maximum).\nFor all phases \u03c6i = 0 we find the value\nS = 2.1175\n(state \u03be (r1 = \u22120.8335; r2 = r3 = \u22120.2446; r4 = 0.4308):\nt1 = t2 = 0; t3 = t4 = 5.77\u03c4S ). If we also vary over the\nphases we obtain a slightly higher value\nS = 2.1596\n(state \u03c7 (r1 = \u22120.7823; r2 = r3 = 0.1460; r4 =\n0.5877; \u03c61 = \u22120.2751; \u03c62 = \u03c63 = \u22120.6784; \u03c64 = 0):\nt1 = t2 = 1.79\u03c4S ; t3 = t4 = 0), see also Fig. 2 (a). For\nthe above cases the concurrence gives\nC(\u03be) = 0.84 e\u2212\u0393(tl+tr )\n\nand C(\u03c7) = 0.94 e\u2212\u0393(tl +tr ) .\n\nIn Fig. 2 (b)-(d) a purity versus concurrence diagrams\nare drawn. For \u03c6+ we notice that the \"decoherence\"\ncaused by the decay exceeds the purity\u2013concurrence values of Werner states, which represent an upper limit for\nall possible decoherence modes in this picture given by\na Lindblad equation for an initially maximally entangled qubit state, Ref. [20, 21]. An early decay of one\nkaon, Fig. 2 (c), exceeds even the purity\u2013concurrence\nvalue of maximally entangled mixed bipartite qubit states\n(MEMS) [22].\nTo sum up, the initial entanglement decreases with a\nsum of times, and it goes first hand in hand with a decrease in purity which can then for latter times increase\nagain. For non\u2013maximal entangled state the decrease of\npurity is much faster than for the maximally entangled\nstates. This seem to help to violate the Bell\u2013CHSH inequality though the ratio of oscillation to decay is low.\nAll other meson systems have the same decay rate for\nboth mass\u2013eigenstates, but no active measurements are\npossible due to their fast decay, a necessary condition\nfor any test of local realistic theories versus QM. For\nB-mesons the symmetric Bell state \u03c8 + violates formally\nthe Bell inequality while \u03c8 \u2212 does not, though both states\nhave the same purity\u2013concurrence behavior. The violation of a Bell inequality depends strongly on the parameters describing these systems, rather than on the amount\nof entanglement.\n\nthe properties of the corresponding states via purity, entanglement and nonlocality. Only two degrees of freedom\nat a certain time can be measured reducing the set of\nobservables and leaving some elements of the state undefined.\nDifferent from photons, nonlocality is for the neutral\nkaon system a quite \"dynamical\" concept as correlations of states evolving up to different times are involved.\nFor entangled photons there is no difference whether in\nprinciple the correlations are measured after one or several meters. With each measurement the experimenter\nchooses among two observables: the quasi\u2013spin and the\ndetection time. Consequently, considering Bell inequalities for mesons, Eq. (2), one can vary in the quasi\u2013spin\nspace or vary the detection times or both. If varying\nin the quasi\u2013spins space and for simplicity choosing all\ntimes equal to zero, it has been shown in Ref. [5] that\nthere is a connection between nonlocality and the violation of a symmetry in high energy physics, i.e. the CP\nsymmetry (C=charge conjugation, P=parity).\nIn this work we have discussed the choice of measuring\non both sides an antikaon versus no antikaon at a certain\ntime, which can experimentally be realized via inserting a\npiece of matter at a certain position from the source (corresponding to the detection time). We find a novel violation of the Bell\u2013CHSH inequality for certain initial states,\nwhich are more \"robust against decoherence\" caused by\nthe decay mechanism. For these states -currently not\navailable by experiments- the concurrence is not maximal in partial agreement with Ref. [23, 24] that optimal\nBell tests do not require maximally entangled states for\nsystems with more than 2 degrees of freedom. A higher\namount of entanglement doesn't necessarily imply an increase of a violation of the Bell inequality under investigation, in fact the Bell inequality need not to be violated\nat all.\nTherefore, these results suggest that for the neutral\nkaon system nonlocality and entanglement are indeed\nsome distinct quantum features which manifest themselves in a way different than that for bipartite qubit\nor qutrit systems, and their relation is subtler than one\nnaively expects.\nAcknowledgement: I want to thank N.
