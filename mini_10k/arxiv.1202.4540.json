The high UV radiation due\nto recombinations, and the energetic electrons from the radioactive decay of 56 Ni and 56 Co\ndissociate molecules efficiently. The presence of molecules in ejecta could thus imply an\ninhomogeneous distribution of material within the ejecta and could constrain the degree of\nmixing. Since CO is an effective coolant (Liu & Dalgarno 1995), it enhances dust formation\nand thus the formation efficiency of CO critically affects the dust formation efficiency. Because of the rapid decrease in density and temperature during condensation in the ejecta,\ndust formation happens through non-equilibrium condensation. There are then two important key questions for dust condensation in supernovae. First, to determine which molecular\nspecies are relevant in non-equilibrium condensation and second, whether the gas in the\nejecta is able to mix with the molecular species.\nThere are only about a dozen SNe known where CO has been detected. SN1987A is the\nonly SN with spectroscopic detections of both the CO fundamental and first overtone bands\n(Wooden et al. 1993; Spyromilio et al. 1988). Other detections of the fundamental band\nhave been made with the Spitzer Space Telescope, but these observations cover only the tail\nof CO feature at wavelengths longwards of 5.3 \u03bcm for SN2004dj, SN 2005aj, and SN2006et\n(Kotak et al. 2006). More detections have been reported in the first overtone band in the\nnear-infrared, with observations of SN 1995ad, SN 1998S, SN 1998dl, SN 1999em, SN 1999gi,\nand SN 2000ew (Gerardy et al. 2002). In all cases, the CO detections correspond to times\nbetween 97- 200 days after the explosion.\nWe previously detected CO in Cas A in near-infrared narrow-band images centered at the\n2.29 \u03bcm first overtone CO band (Rho et al. 2009). In this paper, we report the spectroscopic\ndetection of the fundamental CO band in Cas A with the AKARI Infrared Camera.\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nWe performed AKARI Infrared Camera (IRC; Onaka et al. 2007) observations towards\n4 positions in Cas A. Three positions are the brightest knots in the near-infrared 2.29 \u03bcm\nnarrow-band Palomar image (Rho et al. 2009); two positions are towards the northern shell\n(filenames are \"n1\" and \"n2\"), one towards the south (\"s1\"), and an additional position\ntowards the central position where unshocked silicon ejecta (sipeak) are detected (Rho et al.\n2008).\nThe observations took place in January and July 2009 during AKARI phase 3 (post-\n\n\fTable 1.

The point spread function has a\nFWHM of 4.7\u2032\u2032 , and the pixel size is 1.46\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 1.46\u2032\u2032 . Detailed AKARI AOT configuration and\ninstrument information is described in the AKARI IRC Data User Manual for Post-Helium\n(Phase 3) Mission ver1.1 (Onaka et al. 2009). We used the grism (NG) or the prism (NP)\nmodes for the spectroscopy. For the NG observations we used mostly the narrower slit (Nh)\nwith size 3\u2032\u2032 \u00d71\u2032 except for 3340007.1, for which the wider slit (Ns) of 5\u2032\u2032 \u00d71\u2032 was used. For the\nNP observations, we always used the Ns slit. In the NG mode with the Nh slit, the spectral\nresolution is about 0.02 \u03bcm, which provides a resolving power of 220 at 4.3 \u03bcm, while the\nNG with the Ns slit gives a resolving power of 150 at 4.3 \u03bcm. The spectral resolution of the\nNP mode varies with the wavelength (Ohyama et al. 2007) and is about 40 at 4.5 \u03bcm for the\nNs slit. The AKARI IRC grism spectrum covers 2.4-5 \u03bcm while the prism spectrum extends\nup to 5.5 \u03bcm. In each pointing observation, about 8 exposure cycles were obtained and the\non-source integration time was about 360s. During the spectroscopic observations, one set\nof imaging data at 3.2 \u03bcm was obtained to derive accurate position information. The center\nposition where the spectrum was extracted is derived from the imaging data. The summary\nof the observations is given in Table 1. Note that the attitude control of AKARI is not good\nenough to locate the intended target position on the Ns or Nh slit. Thus the derived position\nis somewhat different from the intended ones. The indicated position is an average over the\nobservation and we listed the positions where we extracted 9 sets of spectra.\nThe data were processed with the latest version of the spectroscopic toolkit (version\n20101025). We extracted a spectrum from the brightest part of 6 pixels along the slit (8.76\u2032\u2032 )\nin each dataset. Thus the spectra that we show here are those extracted either from a\n8.76\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 5\u2032\u2032 (Ns slit) or from a 8.76\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 3\u2032\u2032 (Nh slit) area. Each spectrum was smoothed\nby 3 pixels both in the spectral and spatial direction, which does not degrade the spectral\nresolution. The relative spectral response is determined to be better than 7% around 4.5 \u03bcm,\nwhile the absolute calibration for the Ns and Nh slit spectroscopy has a larger uncertainty\n(\u223c20%).\nWe also reanalyzed Spitzer IRAC images (Ennis et al. 2006; Rho et al. 2008). We subtracted from the IRAC band 2 (4.5 \u03bcm) image the contribution by synchrotron emission\nthat we estimated from the IRAC 3.6 \u03bcm map, after accounting for wavelength- and timedependent zodiacal emission. The IRS images of Ar, Ne and Si images are from Rho et\nal. (2008) and Smith et al. (2009) and the velocities of the ejecta (Table 1) towards the CO\npositions are estimated based on the results of DeLaney et al. (2011).\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n3.\n\nResults: CO properties\n\nFig. 1 shows the AKARI spectra towards four positions in Cas A. The spectra clearly\nshow the double-peaked profile characteristic for the unresolved ro-vibrational band due to\nthe CO fundamental at 4.65 \u03bcm. The CO emission is detected from not only shocked ejecta\nbut also unshocked ejecta at the center. The AKARI spectra show no other lines than\nthe CO fundamental band within our spectral resolution. We were able to extract a dozen\nspectra along the 1\u2032 slit length, some of which are combined to increase the signal-to-noise.\nThe properties of 9 spectra are listed in Table 1.\nWe have determined the physical parameters of the CO gas by comparing the observations to isothermal LTE emission models from the SpectraFactory database1 (Cami et al.\n2010). The observed profiles show clearly separated P and R branches, which suggests that\nthe emission is optically thin (see Fig. 2). We therefore present an analysis in the optically\nthin limit since it greatly simplifies matters. We also considered optically thick models;\nhowever, we found that all spectra are reproduced more efficiently by optically thin models\nthan optically thick ones.\nIn the optically thin limit, the emission is directly proportional to the number of emitting\nmolecules in the beam, and the observed shape of the profile (i.e. band width, peak separation\nand relative strength of the P and R branches) depends only on the temperature. In LTE,\nthe Boltzmann equation determines the relative populations over the molecular levels; and\nwith the frequencies and Einstein A coefficients given by Goorvitch (1994) and the partition\nfunction from the HITRAN database (Rothman et al. 2009, and references therein), we then\ncalculate the line intensities for each of the ro-vibrational transitions that make up the entire\nband. In the SpectraFactory models, each of the individual lines is represented by a gaussian\nline profile with a Doppler width of 3 km s\u22121 . The entire spectrum is then convolved by a\ngaussian (instrumental) profile and rebinned to simulate the observations. While the intrinsic\nline profile and width might not be appropriate for the environment studied here, they have\nno influence on the resulting band profile. Indeed, the instrumental resolution is far too low\nto resolve these individual lines, and since the lines are optically thin, line overlap is not\nimportant.\nFinally, we applied a radial velocity shift to the CO model spectra and included a\nlinear background flux in our model. Our complete fitting routine then runs over models at\ntemperatures between 500 and 3000 K (in steps of 100 K) and for radial velocities in the\nrange -10,000 to +10,000 km s\u22121 (in steps of 10 km s\u22121 ). For each of these combinations, we\n1\n\nhttp://www.spectrafactory.net\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nthen used a non-negative least-squares routine (NNLS, Lawson & Hanson 1974) to find the\nscale factors for the CO model and the background that minimizes the \u03c72 for each of the 9\nCas A spectra.\nTable 1 summarizes the resulting best fit parameters for all spectra. We can reproduce\nthe observed emission with optically thin CO emission at temperatures between 1200 - 2400\nK at the shell and 900 K at the center; an example of the model fits is shown in Fig. 2. Such\ntemperature differences make sense: since the center is where unshocked ejecta (e.g. Si) are\ndetected (Rho et al. 2008) it is not surprising that we find the cooler CO there.\nThe derived radial velocities of the CO gas (see Table 1) however present some puzzles.\nThe different spectra show CO emission at very different velocities ranging from -300 to\n-5600 km s\u22121 . Note that the uncertainty in the NG spectrum is 0.006 \u03bcm which translates\nto an uncertainty of typically 400 km s\u22121 on the velocities. We find that toward 4 positions\n(marked in bold in Table 1), the CO velocities are roughly consistent with those in ejecta,\nbut for the other positions, there are large differences between the CO velocities and those\nmeasured from the gas lines. CO models where the radial velocity is fixed to any of the gas\nline velocities are significantly worse; a comparison is shown in Fig. 2. Although non-LTE\neffects clearly affect the band shape (see Fig. 3), it may well be that some of the CO velocities\nintrinsically differ from the ionized gas line velocities.\nIn the optically thin LTE limit, we can estimate the CO mass as follows. The total\n(integrated) flux in the CO band is given by\nF =N\n\n1\ngi e\u2212Ei /kT Aij h\u03bdij\n\u03a3\n4\u03c0D 2\nP\n\nwhere P is the partition function, N is the total number of CO molecules in the beam, D\nis the distance, gi is the statistical weight and Ei is the energy of the upper level i, Aij\nis the Einstein coefficient for spontaneous transition from i to j and the sum runs over all\ntransitions in the band. Given the derived CO temperature, N is readily calculated, and\nmultiplying this by the mass of a CO molecule then yields the total CO mass per beam.\nThe total CO mass from all 9 spectra combined is about 1.4\u00d710\u22128 M\u2299 , where the derived\nmass for each spectrum is given in Table 1. From the CO fundamental map in Fig. 4, we find\nthat the total CO flux is a factor of 43 higher than the total flux of all 9 spectra combined.\nA rough estimate of the total CO mass in Cas A is thus (5.9\u00b10.3)\u00d710\u22127 M\u2299 .\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n4.\n\nDiscussion\n\nFig. 4 shows the fundamental band CO map. Surprisingly, the distribution of freshly\nformed CO molecules is similar to that of the ejecta, especially when comparing to the Ne\nmap. This indicates that CO molecules are formed in ejecta as a precursor of dust formation.\nThe fact that the morphology of the CO map is almost identical to that of the ejecta map\nproves that CO has formed in an earlier phase of the supernova event, and is now heated by\nthe more recent reverse shock.\nWe also compare the CO map to the 21 \u03bcm dust map (Rho et al. 2008; Barlow et al\n2010). The 21 \u03bcm dust feature can be reproduced mainly with silica (SiO2 ) grains with a\ntemperature of \u223c85 K (Rho et al. 2010) and overall morphology of the two maps is similar.\nThe CO emission coincides with the crescents (see \"green excess\" emission in Fig. 4) where\nthe ratio of [Ne II] to [Ar II] is high (Smith et al. 2009). The 21 \u03bcm dust emission is strongly\ncorrelated with Ar (Rho et al. 2008), whereas the CO molecules are strongly correlated to\nNe ejecta. The presence of CO in Cas A implies that less carbon is available to form carbon\ndust from the ejecta, because a large portion of carbon may have been locked in CO. If Type\nII supernovae such as Cas A are a primary source of dust in high red-shift galaxies, such\ndust may be relatively deficient in carbonaceous grains.\nWhen comparing the AKARI spectra with those of SN 1987A (see Fig. 1), there are\nseveral notable differences: Cas A lacks the Pf\u03b3 and Br\u03b1 hydrogen lines and the underlying\ncontinuum seen in SN1987A, and there are clear differences in the appearance of the CO\nfeatures. In Cas A, the profiles show the double-peak structure that is characteristic for\noptically thin CO emission; in SN1987A, on the other hand, there is no obvious separation\nbetween the peaks, indicating that the CO emission is optically thick (Liu, Dalgarno & Lepp\n1992, see Fig. 1).\nFor SN1987A, Spyromilio & Leibundgut (1996) used an LTE model to study the CO\nemission in the first overtone (2.2\u20132.5 \u03bcm), and estimated a CO mass of \u223c (2 \u2212 5) \u00d7 10\u22125 M\u2299 .\nLiu, Dalgarno & Lepp (1992) later reanalyzed these data with a non-LTE model which reproduces the observed CO overtone bands much better. Consequently, they derived a CO\nmass of 2.2-2.5\u00d710\u22123 M\u2299 , 40 - 100 times larger than the LTE estimate. Also for Cas A,\nmany spectra show non-LTE signatures (see Fig. 3); if these would similarly lead to an underestimate of the CO mass by about the same factor, the CO mass of Cas A could be (2.46)\u00d7 10\u22125 M\u2299 .\nIn SN environments, several mechanisms are known to destroy CO molecules. In the\npresence of small-scale mixing, it is generally believed that CO is destroyed efficiently by\ncollisions with helium ions: He+ + CO \u2192 He + C + + O; if He+ is absent however, efficient\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nCO removal happens through impacts with energetic electrons that can ionize and dissociate\nCO (Liu, Dalgarno & Lepp 1992). Finally, CO is also destroyed by charge transfer with\nNe+ . In a fully mixed model on the other hand, CO is removed by photodissociation and\nphotoionization. When no CO was detected for SN1987A at 800 days after the explosion,\nit was thus concluded that all CO had been destroyed (Wooden et al. 1993). However, the\ndetection of CO in Cas A indicates that CO survives or reforms in the ejecta.\nThe CO detection in Cas A has implications for dust formation in SNe and the cycle of\ncarbon in the ISM. First, current dust formation models (Nozawa et al. 2003) assume that\nCO molecules are destroyed prior to dust formation. However, the CO detection shows this\nis not the case. A significant amount of carbon may have been locked in CO during the\n330-yr lifetime of Cas A. We have checked ISO LWS observations and found that [C II] lines\n(at 158.7 \u03bcm) toward Cas A do not match the velocities of the supernova remnant. After\nsubtracting the background, the lack of [C II] emission associated with Cas A hints that a\nlarge portion of carbon ejecta is in CO and not ionized carbon. It awaits confirmation with\na higher sensitivity and spectral resolution such as with Herschel or SOFIA. Second, the\npresence of CO in Cas A suggests that macroscopic mixing in ejecta is very small. Typical\nelectron densities during the formation of CO are 5\u00d7108 - 106 cm\u22123 (Gearhart et al. 1999).\nThe highly clumpy structures can be explained by such high density CO gas within the\nwarm or hot ejecta. The HST observations of Cas A (Fesen 2001) suggest a size between\n0.2\u2032\u2032 -0.6\u2032\u2032 (physical size of 6000-12000 AU). Assuming that the density of CO is 5\u00d7108 - 106\ncm\u22123 and using the estimated CO mass in Table 1 the clump size would be 2-14 (20-140) AU\nfor a filling factor of 10\u22121 (10\u22124 ). Note that a CO density could not be directly estimated\nbecause the beam for the spectrum is too large compared to the size of clumps and thus the\nuncertainty of the filling factor dominates.\nWe found CO knots outside the bright ring and near the jet-like structures, and found\nthat some of the clumps did not have ejecta counterparts. These dense, molecular ejecta\nclumps propagate into the ISM and will eventually cool down to ISM temperatures. Our\nobservations thus provide direct evidence that supernovae eject dense clumps into the ISM.\nIn summary, our observations support the idea that SNe could be important sites of\nmolecule formation resulting in species such as CO, SiO, SiS, O2 , SO, and CO2 (Cherchneff & Lilly\n2008). A significant portion of the CO molecules has survived at least \u223c 330 years after the\ninitial explosion. Cherchneff & Dwek (2009) suggest that molecules form very efficiently in\nthe ejecta of supernovae and that 13\u201334% of the progenitor mass of ejecta material could\nbe in molecular form. For a 25 M\u2299 progenitor, Woosley, Heger, & Weaver (2002) estimated\na gas ejecta mass of \u223c15 M\u2299 after accounting for mass loss; however, observations of Cas\nA infer an observed ejecta mass of \u223c4 M\u2299 (Hwang et al. 2011). If CO locks up C and O\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nin molecular form, and other molecular species lock up other heavy elements, then some of\nthe missing ejecta mass could be in molecular form as well as in dust form. Recently, a\ndust mass of 0.4-0.7 M\u2299 was estimated in SN1987A (Matsuura et al. 2011), emphasizing the\nimportance of dust in supernovae.\nWe have shown the detection of the fundamental vibrational mode of CO at 4.65 \u03bcm\nfrom Cas A with AKARI. We infer CO temperatures of 900 - 2400 K and a total CO mass\nof (5.9\u00b10.3)\u00d710\u22127 M\u2299 using an LTE model. CO has not been efficiently destroyed, and\nmolecular species could thus be a significant reservoir of heavy elements in the ejecta. Future\nmodeling including supernovae explosion models and CO radiative transport calculations in\nnon-LTE will allow us to examine the core density profiles and the circumstellar medium\nprofile before the explosion.\nThe First Light TEst CAMera (FLITECAM) (McLean et al. 2006) on SOFIA covers\n1-5\u03bcm, and it will be easier to detect the first overtone and fundamental CO bands when\nobserving in the stratosphere than from the ground. High resolution spectroscopy in the\nmid-infrared (EXES) and low-resolution grism (FORCAST) (Adams et al. 2010) on SOFIA\nwill thus further advance our understanding of molecule and dust evolution.\nWe thank Tracey DeLaney for providing the doppler-shifted velocity of ionic lines. This\nwork is based on observations with AKARI, a JAXA project with the participation of ESA,\nand made with the Spitzer Space Telescope.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n\nFig. 1.- AKARI IRC spectra of Cas A showing the CO fundamental band detection.
