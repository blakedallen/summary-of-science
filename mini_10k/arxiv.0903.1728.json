Sin e the\nmost of potentially interesting ele tron devi es are of nanometer sizes, it is of interest to see\nhow magneti properties of the relevant systems depend on their \u001cnite sizes [1, 2\u2104. The typi al\nexample is the thin \u001clm of the diluted magneti semi ondu tor (e.g., Ga1\u2212xMnxAs) with the\nthi kness on the order of some tens of the latti e periods whi h are onsidered in the present\npaper. In su h systems, the mobility of harge arriers (holes) is low (on the order of 10\nm2/V*s [3\u2104) and, hen e, their mean free path is also short. Then the ollisional broadening\nof the hole energy levels is so high that the system appears to be e\u001be tively three dimensional\none, and there is no need to take into a ount e\u001be ts of the size quantization [4\u2104.\nThe magnetization of a thin enough \u001clm of the diluted magneti semi ondu tor (whose\nthi kness L is omparable with the hara teristi length l of the magneti impurities' indire t\nintera tion, see below) ould be essentially nonuniform, at least, in the dire tion perpendi ular\nto the \u001clm plane. It is onvenient to hara terize su h a nonuniform magnetization, depending\non oordinates, by the redu ed lo al magnetization j(r) \u2261 M(r)/Ms (Ms is the saturation\nmagnetization). Non-zero lo al magnetization (0 \u2264 j \u2264 1 ) of Mn atoms with the spin\nSMn = 5/2 leads to the nonuniform lo al spin polarization of holes re\u001de ting in the fa t\nthat the lo al on entration p\u2212(r) of holes with spins, antiparallel to the lo al magnetization,\nex eeds the on entration p+(r) of holes with the opposite spin dire tion. At that, the lo al\nhole polarization \u03be(r) = [p\u2212(r) \u2212 p+(r)]/p(r) does not equal zero ( p(r) = p\u2212(r) + p+(r) is the\ntotal hole on entration). Formally, the hole polarization ould be related with the e\u001be tive\nspin-depending magneti potential [5\u2104\nVmag (r) = xN0 a3 Jpd \u03c3SMn j(r),\n(1)\nin\u001duen ing on the holes.

A ording to (1), major holes (with the preferred spin\norientation) are a umulated in regions of the high magnetization, and, ontrary, minor ones\nare pushed out in regions with the low magnetization.\nSu h a spin separation of arriers in the spa e ould be, in prin iple, a ompanied by\nmodifying the spatial distribution of holes resulting in the violation of the lo al harge neutrality.\nTo see if that possible in the onsidered ase, noti e that the hara teristi displa ement of the\nhole harge \u0010 entroid\u0011 over a distan e \u03b4L leads to the ele tri potential equal to\nVel \u223c\n\n4\u03c0pe2\n(\u03b4L)2 ,\n\u03ba\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03ba \u223c 10 is the semi ondu tor diele tri onstant.

In the present paper, we shall not go beyond onsidering su h a\nase.\nLet the Fermi energy of harge arriers in the absen e of the magnetization (j = 0) be \u03b5F .\nMagneti potential (1), arising with the origination of the magnetization, leads to splitting the\nhole band into two spin sub-bands with e\u001be tive Fermi energies (measured from bottoms of\nthose sub-bands) \u03b5F + Vmag (r) and \u03b5F \u2212 Vmag (r) whi h orrespond to following Fermi momenta\nkF\u00b1 (r)\n\n\u00131/2\n\u0012\nVmag (r)\n,\n= kF 1 \u00b1\n\u03b5F\n\nkF = (2m\u2217 \u03b5F /~2 )1/2 , m\u2217 \u2248 0.5m0\nkF\u2212 (r) = 0).\n\nwhere\n\n(3)\n\nis the e\u001be tive hole mass (at\n\nVmag (r)/\u03b5F > 1,\n\nCarrier on entrations in the sub-bands are determined by the set of simple equations\np\u2212 (r) \u221d [\u03b5F + Vmag (r) ]3/2 ,\n\nfrom whi h it follows\n\np\u2212 (r) =\n\nwhere\n\np+ (r) \u221d [\u03b5F \u2212 Vmag (r) ]3/2 ,\n\np\n[1 + \u03be(r)],\n2\n\u03be(r) =\n\np+ (r) =\n\np\u2212 (r) + p+ (r) = p,\n\np\n[1 \u2212 \u03be(r)],\n2\n\nu(r) \u2212 1\nu(r) + 1\n\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n\nis the hole spin polarization, u(r) = {[1 + Vmag (r)/\u03b5F ]/[1 \u2212 Vmag (r)/\u03b5F ]}3/2 (if Vmag (r)/\u03b5F > 1,\nthen p\u2212 = p, p+ = 0, \u03be = 1).\nWith the uniform magnetization (j = Const), momenta kF\u00b1 do not depend on oordinates\nand the expression for the energy w(\u03c1) of the indire t intera tion of two magneti atoms,\nseparated by a distan e \u03c1 from ea h other, taking into a ount the spin splitting of the hole\nband ould be written in the form\n1\nw(\u03c1) = \u2212 I0 \u03a6(\u03c1) exp(\u2212\u03c1/l),\n2\n\n2\n\n(7)\n\n\fwhere, as an example, the RKKY range fun tion reads [7\u2104\n\u0012 \u00134\na\n\u03a6(\u03c1) =\n[\u03b8+ (\u03c1) cos \u03b8+ (\u03c1) \u2212 sin \u03b8+ (\u03c1) + \u03b8\u2212 (\u03c1) cos \u03b8\u2212 (\u03c1) \u2212 sin \u03b8\u2212 (\u03c1)],\n\u03c1\n\u0012 2 \u0013\nma 2\n1\nJ\n, \u03b8\u00b1 (\u03c1) = 2kF\u00b1 \u03c1.\nI0 =\n3\n32\u03c0\n~2 pd\n\n(8)\n(9)\n\nExponential fa tor in (7) allows for the \u001cnite length l of the hole spin relaxation [8\u2104 (in the\nsimplest ase, oin iding with their mean free path).\nWith in reasing magneti potential (1), the intensity of the intera tion (7) is hanged. One\nould judge that from the behaviour of the fun tion \u03a6(\u03c1) at distan es lose to the mean distan e\n\u03c1\u0304 between impurities. Spatial dependen ies of the RKKY-fun tion \u03a6(\u03c1) for various values of\nthe ratio Vmag /\u03b5F are shown in Fig. 1. It is lear that in the inter-impurity distan e range of\n\u03c1\u0304 = 1.5a \u2212 2a, orresponding to the impurity on entration x = 0.05 \u2212 0.1, the intera tion\nenergy (at a \u001cxed \u03b5F value) de reases noti eably with in reasing Vmag . What that means is the\nspin splitting of the hole band has to result, in the end, in de reasing the system magnetization.\nThe generalization of the fun tion (8) over the ase of the non-uniform magnetization ould\nbe done with repla ing phases \u03b8\u00b1(\u03c1) by their average values\n\u2217\n\u03b8\u00b1\n(\u03c1) = 2\n\nZ\u03c1\n\nkF\u00b1 (s)ds = 2kF\n\n0\n\nZ\u03c1 p\n\n1 \u00b1 Aj(s)ds,\n\n(10)\n\n0\n\nwhere A = xN0 a3Jpd\u03c3SMn/\u03b5F , and the integration is performed along the line onne ting the\nimpurities. Then the fun tion \u03a6(\u03c1) be omes the fun tional of the spatially non-uniform magnetization:\n\u03a6(\u03c1) exp(\u2212\u03c1/l) \u2192 F\u0302 [Aj(r), \u03c1] \u2261\n\u0012 \u00134\na\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2261\n[\u03b8+\n(\u03c1) cos \u03b8+\n(\u03c1) \u2212 sin \u03b8+\n(\u03c1) + \u03b8\u2212\n(\u03c1) cos \u03b8\u2212\n(\u03c1) \u2212 sin \u03b8\u2212\n(\u03c1)]e\u2212\u03c1/l .\n\u03c1\n\n(11)\n\nUnder low magnetization (j \u226a 1), the magneti potential (1) is also low, and the expression\n(11) goes to the standard form.\nThe \u001cnite arrier polarization is important in the only ase when the magneti potential\nand Fermi energy are omparable, that is at Aj \u223c 1. Let us estimate the parameter A for\nthe magneti semi ondu tor Ga1\u2212xMnxAs. Due to the ompensation, the hole on entration\np is always lower than the on entration xN0 of Mn atoms (a eptors) positioned in Ga-sites.\nNevertheless, p/(xN0 ) & 0.3 at x = 0.05 [9\u2104. The estimate for that ase leads to A & 1. If,\nin addition, the lo al magnetization in some regions of the system is lose to the saturation\n(j \u223c 1), then Aj \u223c 1 and taking a ount of the \u001cnite arrier polarization ould be important.\nTo test the validity of that on lusion, we have arried out al ulating the spatial distribution\nof the magnetization in a thin magneti semi ondu tor \u001clm where the magnetization is parallel\nto the \u001clm surfa e. In doing so, we have employed the approa h elaborated early [4\u2104.\nThe energy WRKKY of the indirePt\u221eintera tion of a given spin Si with its surraundings is\nde\u001cned by the relation WRKKY = j=1 w(\u03c1ij ).

Below, we onsider the magneti intera tion in the \u001clm\nof the thi kness L (in the z-axis dire tion) whi h is so thin that the lo al magnetization j(h)\nwithin the \u001clm is always parallel to the surfa e and depends on the given point distan e h from\nthe median \u001clm plane only2.

It di\u001bers from the equation onsidered early[4\u2104\nin that its kernel is the fun tional of the non-uniform magnetization (due to the \u001cnite arrier\nspin polarization). The solution of the obtained equation has been found, as in [4\u2104, by the\nsu essive approximations method.\nSpatial distributions of the magnetization in the \u001clm of the thi kness L = 20a at various\ntemperatures \u03c4 are shown in Fig. 2. The hosen value kF a = 1 orresponds to the hole\non entration p \u2248 2 * 1020 \u00f1\u00ec\u22123, hara teristi to Ga1\u2212xMnx As with x = 0.05. It is lear\nthat taking a ount of the band splitting, leading to the \u001cnite arrier polarization, de reases\nnoti eably, as might be expe ted, the system magnetization. Near the \u001clm surfa e the magnetization drops qui kly, and the thi kness of the relevant subsurfa e regions is almost linearly\nin rease with the temperature ( f. Fig. 2).\nThe magnetization of \u0010thi k\u0011 \u001clms (L \u2192 \u221e) is nearly uniform (ex ept for \u0010thin\u0011 nearsurfa e regions where it is twi e as low omparing to the bulk). The e\u001be t of the band splitting\nevaluated for that ase by the ratio j(A = 1, L \u2192 \u221e)/j(A = 0, L \u2192 \u221e), is illustrated by\nFig. 3, where its temperature dependen e is shown. It ould be seen that at \u03c4 & 0.2\u03c4C the e\u001be t\nis very notable.\nIt is onvenient to hara terize the non-uniformly magnetized \u001clm by its average magnetization\n1\nhji =\nL\n\nZL/2\n\nj(z)dz.\n\n(19)\n\n\u2212L/2\n\nTemperature dependen ies of that quantity for the \u001clm of the thi kness L = 20a are represented\nin Fig. 4. They allow to \u001cnd the Curie temperature TC, de\u001cned as the temperature at whi h\nhji \u2192 0. Near the Curie temperature, j \u226a 1 and, hen e, taking into a ount the \u001cnite spin\npolarization does not hange TC value. That is immediately seen from Fig. 4, where both\ndependen ies hji(\u03c4 ) (for A = 0 and A = 1) give the same value \u03c4C \u2248 1.\nIn the framework of the onsidered s heme, it is easy to \u001cnd spatial distributions of the\narrier spin polarization, as well as those of major and minor arrier on entrations. Corresponding dependen ies, obtained with the help of Eqs. (5),(6), are shown in Fig. 4. It follows,\ntherefrom, that the hole polarization \u03be in the entral part of the \u001clm is more higher than at\nthe periphery. That is onne ted with the spatial separation of arriers with di\u001berent spin\npolarization: major arriers on entrate away from the \u001clm surfa e, and minor ones \u0015 in\nperipheral regions. (In those regions, the violation of the ele tri neutrality is possible, so the\nrelevant results should be onsidered as qualitative ones.)\nAt T \u2192 TC Eq. (18) is simpli\u001ced, turning into the homogeneous linear integral equation:\n1\nj(h) =\n\u03c4C\n\nZL/2\n\nK(z, h) j(z)dz,\n\n(20)\n\nz=\u2212L/2\n\nfrom whi h one ould see that the Curie temperature \u03c4C is nothing than the eigenvalue of that\nequation kernel. Due to the symmetry of the kernel (K(z, h) = K(h, z), see. (17)) su h an\n5\n\n\feigenvalue is always exists [11\u2104. To determine it, any one of a number of known numeri al\nmethods [12\u2104 is appropriate. However, in pra ti e it is more simply to \u001cnd an approximate \u03c4C\nvalue by the above des ribed approa h.\nIn the same way, magneti properties of a thin wire ould be onsidered. The generalization\nof the relevant integral equation [13\u2104, for the ase of the lo al magnetization being everywhere\noriented along the wire axis and depending on distan e h to that axis only, reads\n\uf8ee\n\nwhere R is the wire radius,\n\nj(h) = tanh \uf8f0\n\nK(r, h) = \u2212n\u03bc r\n\nZ2\u03c0\n0\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\nZ\u221e\n\n\u03c1min\n\n1\n\u03c4\n\nZR\n0\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\u03c1F\u0302 [Aj(r), \u03c1]\np\n\n\u03c12 \u2212 r 2 \u2212 h2 + 2rh cos \u03c6\n\n\u03c1min = \u03c1min (r, h, \u03c6) = Max[(r 2 + h2 \u2212 2rh cos \u03c6)1/2 , rmin ].\n\nEq.

As\nwell as for a \u001clm, the splitting of the arrier band results in the essential lowering the system\nmagnetization. E.g., at \u03c4 \u223c 0.1 the magnetization in points, spa ed at the distan e h = R/2\nfrom the axis, de reases by 2.5 times be ause of that e\u001be t.\nThe strong non-uniformity of the lo al magnetization results in that temperature dependenies of the average wire magnetization, shown in Fig. 6, have unusual on ave shape. In the\ninset of Fig. 6, spatial dependen ies of the on entrations p\u2212, p+ of major and minor arriers\nalong with their polarization are displayed. One ould see that the noti eable hole polarization\no urs in the paraxial wire region only and (at \u03c4 = 0.1) rea hes \u223c 80%.\nIn on lusion, we have onsidered the ontinual model of the non-uniform magnetism in\nthin \u001clms and wires of diluted magneti semi ondu tor under a \u001cnite spin polarization of\narriers responsible for the indire t (RKKY) intera tion of magneti impurities. We su eeded\nin obtaining spatial distributions of the magnetization des ribed by the non-linear integral\nequation with the help of qui kly onverging iterative pro edure. They o urs to be essentially\nnon-uniform and strongly dependent on splitting the band of arriers responsible for the\nindire t intera tion between magneti impurities. Results ould be used to des ribe properties\nof nanosized systems of diluted magneti semi ondu tors.\nA knowledgments\n\nThe work is supported by Grant# 09-02-00579 of the Russian Foundation of Basi Resear hes\nand ISTC Grant # G-1335.\n6\n\n\fReferen es\n[1\u2104 E.Z.
