We study the endomorphism algebras of a modular Gelfand-Graev\nrepresentation of a finite reductive group by investigating modular properties of\nhomomorphisms constructed by Curtis and Curtis-Shoji.\n\nLet G be a connected reductive group defined over an algebraic closure F of the\nfield of p-elements Fp and suppose that it is endowed with a Frobenius endomorphism\nF : G \u2192 G relative to an Fq -structure. Since the work of Lusztig, it has been\nnatural to ask to what extent the theory of the representations of GF depends on\nq. For example, it was shown by Lusztig that the unipotent characters of GF are\nparametrized by a set which is independent of q (the set depends solely on the Weyl\ngroup of G and on the action of F on this Weyl group).\nOn the side of l-modular representations (where l is a prime different from p),\nthe work of Fong and Srinivasan on the general linear and unitary groups [FS1] and\non the classical groups [FS2], then that of Brou\u00e9, Malle and Michel (introducing\nthe notion of generic groups [BMM]) and of Cabanes and Enguehard [CE1] give\nevidence of analogous results. For instance, in most cases, the unipotent l-blocks of\nGF only depend on the order of q modulo l, and not on the value of q itself [CE2,\nChapter 22].\nLet (K, O, k) denote an l-modular system, sufficiently large. In this article we will\nG\nstudy the endomorphism algebra H(d)\nof a modular Gelfand-Graev representation\nFd\nFd\nG\n\u0393(d) of G (this is a projective OG -module). We will study also the corresponding\nG\nG\nG G\nunipotent parts bG\n(d) H(d) and b(d) \u0393(d) (here, b(d) denotes the sum of the unipotent\nd\nblocks of OGF ). We make the following conjecture, which is related to the question\nmentioned above:\nd\n\nConjecture 1. If l does not divide [GF : GF ], then the O-algebras\nG\nG\nG\nbG\n(d) H(d) and b(1) H(1) are isomorphic.\nDate: November 3, 2018.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Kessar\n\n2\nd\n\nG\nThe OGF -module bG\n(d) \u0393(d) is projective and indecomposable : it is the projective\ncover of the modular Steinberg module. Conjecture 1, if proven, would show that\nthe endomorphism algebra of this module does not depend too much on q.\nIn this article, we approach Conjecture 1 by the study of a morphism K CurG\nL,(d) :\nG\nL\nd\nKH(d) \u2192 KH(d) (where L is an F -stable Levi subgroup of a parabolic subgroup of\nG). When T is a maximal F d -stable torus of G, this morphism was constructed by\nCurtis [C, Theorem 4.2] and it is defined over O (i.e. there exists a morphism of alG\nG\nT\nFd\ngebras CurG\nsuch that K CurG\nT,(d) : H(d) \u2192 H(d) = OT\nT,(d) is obtained from CurT,(d)\nby extension of scalars). We will also consider a product of Curtis homomorphisms\nY\nd\nG\nCurG\n:\nH\n\u2212\u2192\nOTF ,\n(d)\n(d)\nT\u2208T F\n\nd\n\nwhere T is the variety of maximal tori of G. Finally, we will study a morphism of\nG\nG\nK-algebras K \u2206G : KH(d)\n\u2192 KH(1)\ndefined by Curtis and Shoji [CS, Theorem 1].\nWith this notation, we can state Conjecture 1 more precisely :\nConjecture 2. With the notation above, we have:\n(a) K CurG\nL is defined over O.\nG\n(b) K \u2206 is defined over O.\nd\n(c) If l does not divide [GF : GF ], then K \u2206G induces an isomorG\nG\nG\nphism bG\n(d) H(d) \u2243 b(1) H(1) .\nThe main results of this article are obtained under the hypothesis that l does not\ndivide the order of the Weyl group W of G.\nTheorem. If l does not divide |W |, then Conjecture 2 holds.\nStatement (a) is proved in Corollary 3.12 ; statement (b) in Theorem 4.4 ; statement (c) is shown in Theorem 4.9. In order to obtain our theorem, we proved two\nmore precise results which do not necessarily hold when l does divide |W |.\nTheorem 3.7. If l does not divide |W |, then\nG\nIm(CurG\n(d) ) = Im( K Cur(d) ) \u2229\n\nY\n\nT\u2208T F\n\nd\n\nOTF .\nd\n\nTheorem 3.13. If l does not divide |W |, then\nG\nbG\n(d) H(d) \u2243 (OS)\nd\n\nN\n\nGF\n\nd (S)\n\n,\n\nwhere S is a Sylow l-subgroup of GF .\nRemark- With the above notation, if l does not divide |W |, then S is abelian, and\nhence a consequence of the above result is that if l does not divide |W |, then the\n\n\fEndomorphism algebras of Gelfand-Graev representations\n\n3\n\nG\nisomorphism type of the O-algebra bG\n(d) H(d) depends only on the fusion of l-elements\nd\nin GF .\n\nThis article is organized as follows. In the first section, we recall the definitions\nof the Gelfand-Graev representations as well as some of the principal properties of\ntheir endomorphism algebras (commutativity for example). In the second section,\nwe construct the generalisation of the Curtis homomorphism. In the third part\nwe study the product of Curtis homomorphisms and prove, amongst other things,\nTheorems 3.7 and 3.13 stated above. In the last part, we study the Curtis-Shoji\nhomomorphism and prove statement (c) of Conjecture 2 when l does not divide |W |.\n\nNotation - If A is a finite dimensional algebra over a field, we denote by R(A)\nthe Grothendieck group of the category of finitely generated A-modules. If M is\na finitely generated A-module, we denote by [M] its class in R(A). The opposite\nalgebra of A will be denoted by A\u25e6 .\nAll along this paper, we fix a prime number p, an algebraic closure F of the finite\nfield with p elements Fp , a prime number l different from p and an algebraic extension\nK of the l-adic field Ql . Let O be the ring of integers of K, let l be the maximal\nideal of O and let k denote the residue field of O: k is an algebraic extension of\nthe finite field Fl . Throughout this paper, we assume that the l-modular system\n(K, O, k) is sufficiently large for all the finite groups considered in this paper.\nIf \u039b is a commutative O-algebra (for instance \u039b = k or K), and if M is an Omodule, we set \u039bM = \u039b \u2297O M. If f : M \u2192 N is a morphism of O-modules, we\ndefine \u039bf : \u039bM \u2192 \u039bN to be the morphism Id\u039b \u2297O f . If V is a free left \u039b-module,\nwe denote by V \u2217 = Hom\u039b (V, \u039b) its dual: if V is a left A-module for some \u039b-algebra\nA, then V \u2217 is seen as a right A-module.\nIf G is a finite group, we denote by Irr G the set of irreducible characters of G over\nK. If \u03c7 \u2208 Irr G, let e\u03c7 (or eG\n\u03c7 if we need to emphasize the ambient group) denote\nthe associated central primitive idempotent of KG :\n\u03c7(1) X\n\u03c7(g \u22121 )g.\ne\u03c7 =\n|G| g\u2208G\nThe conjugacy relation in G is denoted by \u223c or \u223cG if necessary.\n\n1. Background material\n1.A. The set-up. We fix once and for all a connected reductive algebraic group G\nover F and we assume that it is endowed with an isogeny F : G \u2192 G such that\n\n\fC. Bonnaf\u00e9 & R. Kessar\n\n4\n\nsome power of F is a Frobenius endomorphism of G with respect to some rational\nstructure on G over a finite extension of Fp . We denote by q the positive real number\nsuch that, for every \u03b4 > 1 such that F \u03b4 is a Frobenius endomorphism of G over a\nfinite field with r elements, we have r = q \u03b4 .\n1.B. Gelfand-Graev representations. We fix an F -stable Borel subgroup BG of\nG and an F -stable maximal torus of BG . Let UG denote the unipotent radical of\nBG . We fix once and for all a regular linear character \u03c8 : UFG \u2192 O\u00d7 \u2282 K \u00d7 (in the\nsense of [DLM1, Definition 2.3]). Since |UFG | = q dim UG is a power of p, the primitive\ncentral idempotent e\u03c8 of KUFG belongs to OUFG . We denote by O\u03c8 the projective\nOUFG -module OUFG e\u03c8 : it is O-free of rank one and is acted on by UFG through \u03c8.\nLet\nF\n\u0393G = OGF e\u03c8 \u2243 IndG\nUF O\u03c8 .\nG\n\nThen \u0393G is a projective OGF -module; the corresponding representation is called a\nGelfand-Graev representation of GF .\nLet HG denote the endomorphism algebra of the OGF -module \u0393G . We have\nHG \u2243 (e\u03c8 OGF e\u03c8 )\u25e6\n\n(1.1)\n\nSince OGF is a symmetric algebra, we have that\nHG is symmetric.\n\n(1.2)\n\nThe next result is much more difficult (see [S, Theorem 15] for the general case):\nTheorem 1.3. The algebra HG is commutative.\nTherefore, we shall identify the algebras HG and e\u03c8 OGF e\u03c8 .\nIf \u039b is a commutative O-algebra, we denote by e\u039b\u03c8 the idempotent 1\u039b \u2297O e\u03c8 of\n\u039bUFG = \u039b \u2297O OUFG . Since \u0393G is projective, the \u039bGF -module \u039b\u0393G is also projective\nand its endomorphism algebra is \u039bHG (since it is isomorphic to Hom\u039b (\u039b\u0393G , \u039b)\u2297\u039bGF\n\u039b\u0393G ). We have of course (taking into account that HG is symmetric)\n\u039bHG = e\u039b\u03c8 \u039bGF e\u039b\u03c8 .\n\n(1.4)\nSince KGF is split semisimple,\n(1.5)\n\nThe algebra KHG is split semisimple.\n\nRemark 1.6 - There might be several Gelfand-Graev representations of OGF .\nBut they are all conjugate by elements g \u2208 G such g \u22121 F (g) belongs to the centre of\nG, and this gives a parametrization of Gelfand-Graev representations by the group\nof F -conjugacy classes in the centre of G (see [DLM1, 2.4.10]). In particular, their\nendomorphism algebras are all isomorphic.\n\n\fEndomorphism algebras of Gelfand-Graev representations\n\n5\n\nMoreover, if the centre of G is connected, there is only one (up to isomorphism)\nGelfand-Graev representation. In special orthogonal or symplectic groups in odd\ncharacteristic, there are two (isomorphism classes of) Gelfand-Graev representations. \u0003\n1.C. Representations of KHG . Let (G\u2217 , F \u2217 ) be a dual pair to (G, F ) in the\nsense of Deligne and Lusztig [DL, Definition 5.21]. We denote by G\u2217sem the set of\n\u2217\n\u2217\nsemisimple elements of G\u2217 . If s \u2208 G\u2217F\nsem , we denote by (s)G\u2217F its conjugacy class in\nF\n\u2217F \u2217\nand by E(G , (s)G\u2217F \u2217 ) the associated rational Lusztig series (see [DM, Page\nG\nF\n\u2217\n136]). We denote by \u03c7G\ns the unique element of E(G , (s)G\u2217F ) which is an irreducible\nG\ncomponent of the character afforded by K\u0393 . We view it as a function KGF \u2192 K\nG\nand we denote by \u03c7H\nits restriction to KHG . Then (see [DL, Theorem 10.7] for\ns\nthe case where the centre of G is connected and [A] for the general case; see also\n[B3, Remark of Page 80] for the case where F is not a Frobenius endomorphism),\nX\n(1.7)\n[K\u0393G ] =\n\u03c7G\ns .\n\u2217F \u2217 /\u223c\n(s)G\u2217F \u2217 \u2208Gsem\n\nTherefore, the next proposition is a particular case of [CR, Theorem 11.25 and\nCorollaries 11.26 and 11.27], taking into account that KHG is semisimple and commutative (or, equivalently, that K\u0393G is multiplicity free):\nProposition 1.8. We have:\nG\n\n\u2217\n\n(a) The map s 7\u2192 \u03c7H\ninduces a bijection between the set of G\u2217F -conjugacy\ns\n\u2217\nclasses of semisimple elements of G\u2217F and the set of irreducible characters\nof KHG .\n\u2217\n(b) The map s 7\u2192 e\u03c7G\ne\u03c8 induces a bijection between the set of G\u2217F -conjugacy\ns\n\u2217\nclasses of semisimple elements of G\u2217F and the set of primitive idempotents\nof KHG .\n\u2217\n\nMoreover, if s \u2208 G\u2217F\nsem , then:\nG\n\nG\n\n\u2217\n\n(c) We have \u03c7H\ne\u03c8 ) = 1 and \u03c7H\ne\u03c8 ) = 0 if t \u2208 G\u2217F\ns (e\u03c7G\ns (e\u03c7G\nsem is not conjugate\ns\nt\n\u2217\n\u2217F\nto s in G .\n(d) e\u03c7G\ne\u03c8 is the primitive idempotent of KHG associated with the irreducible\ns\nG\ncharacter \u03c7H\ns .\n(e) The KGF -module KGF e\u03c7G\ne\u03c8 is irreducible and affords the character \u03c7G\ns .\ns\nG\nG\nF\n(f) If \u03c7 \u2208 E(G , (s)G\u2217F \u2217 ) and if \u03c7 6= \u03c7s , then \u03c7(h) = 0 for all h \u2208 KH .\nSince KHG is split and commutative, all its irreducible representations have dimension one.

A generalization of the Curtis homomorphisms\nIn [C, Theorem 4.2], Curtis constructed a homomorphism of algebras fT : HG \u2192\nOTF , for T an F -stable maximal torus of G (in fact, Curtis constructed a homomorphism of algebras KHG \u2192 KTF but it is readily checked from his formulas that\nit is defined over O). We propose here a generalization of this construction to the\ncase where T is replaced by an F -stable Levi subgroup L of a parabolic subgroup\nof G: we then get a morphism KHG \u2192 KHL (note that, if L is a maximal torus,\nthen HL = OTF ). We conjecture that this morphism is defined over O and prove\nit whenever G + (G, L, P) holds or whenever L is a maximal torus (see Theorem 2.7)\nor whenever l does not divide the order of W (see Corollary 3.12).\n\n2.A. A morphism KHG \u2192 KHL . Let P be a parabolic subgroup of G and\nassume that P admits an F -stable Levi complement L.\nThe Gelfand-Graev representation \u0393G of OGF having been fixed, there is a welldefined (up to isomorphism) Gelfand-Graev representation \u0393L of OLF associated to\nit [B3, Page 77] (see also [B1]). We fix an F -stable Borel subgroup BL of L and we\ndenote by UL its unipotent radical. We fix once and for all a regular linear character\nF\n\u03c8L of UFL such that \u0393L = IndLUF O\u03c8L = OLF e\u03c8L .

This is equivalent\nG\nto say that TrG\nL\u2282P = TrL\u2282P\u2032 .\nG\nFor instance, we have TrG\nL\u2282P = TrL\u2282P\u2032 if L is a maximal torus [DL, Corollary\n4.3], or if P and P\u2032 are F -stable (this is due to Deligne: a proof can be found in\n[DM, Theorem 5.1]), or if F is a Frobenius endomorphism and q 6= 2 (see [BM]). In\nall these cases, this fact is a consequence of the Mackey formula for Deligne-Lusztig\nmaps. \u0003\nThe Gelfand-Graev representation \u0393L satisfies the following property:\nTheorem 2.3. Assume that one of the following three conditions is satisfied:\n(1) P is F -stable.\n(2) The centre of L is connected.\n(3) p is almost good for G, F is a Frobenius endomorphism of G and q is large\nenough.\nG\nThen \u2217RL\u2282P\n[K\u0393G ] = (\u22121)dP [K\u0393L ].\n\nProof. (1) is due to Rodier: a proof may be found in [DLM1, Theorem 2.9]. (2) is\nproved in [DLM1, Proposition 5.4].

However, at the time of the writing of this paper, this general\nconjecture is still unproved.

In light of the above theorem, and as there are many other\nindications that G(G, L, P) holds in general, this should not be viewed as a big\nrestriction.\nIn fact, there is also strong evidence that the perfect complex of OLF -modules\n\u2217 G\nRL\u2282P \u0393G is concentrated in degree dP : more precisely, it is conjectured [BR2, Conjecture 2.3] that\n(G + (G, L, P))\n\n\u2217\n\nG\nL\nRG\nL\u2282P \u0393 \u2243 \u0393 [\u2212dP ]\n\nThe conjectural property G + (G, L, P) is a far reaching extension of G(G, L, P). It\nis known to hold only if P is F -stable (see Theorem 2.3 (1) or [BR2, Theorem 2.1]\nfor a module-theoretic proof) or if L is a maximal torus and (P, F (P)) lies in the\norbit associated with an element of the Weyl group which is a product of simple\nreflections lying in different F -orbits [BR2, Theorem 3.10]. Of course, a proof of\nthis conjecture would produce immediately a morphism of O-algebras HG \u2192 HL\n(which is uniquely determined since HL is commutative). However, as we shall see\nin this section, we only need that G(G, L, P) holds to get the following result:\nProposition 2.4.

The map CurG is injective.\nWe shall now recall a characterization of elements of the image of K CurG which\nwas obtained by Curtis and Shoji [CS, Lemma 5]. We need some notation. Let S G\ndenote the set of pairs (w, \u03b8) such that w \u2208 W and \u03b8 is a linear character of TFw\n(which may also be viewed as a morphism of algebras OTFw \u2192 O or KTFw \u2192 K).\n\n\fC.

Kessar\n\n14\n\nIf (w, \u03b8) and (w \u2032, \u03b8\u2032 ) are two elements of S G , we write (w, \u03b8) \u2261 (w \u2032, \u03b8\u2032 ) if (Tw , \u03b8)\nand (Tw\u2032 , \u03b8\u2032 ) lie in the same rational series (see for instance [B3, Definition 9.4] for\na definition).\nQ\nCorollary 3.4 (Curtis-Shoji). Let t = (tw )w\u2208W \u2208 w\u2208W KTFw . Then t \u2208 Im K CurG\nif and only if, for all (w, \u03b8), (w \u2032 , \u03b8\u2032 ) \u2208 S G such that (w, \u03b8) \u2261 (w \u2032 , \u03b8\u2032 ), we have\n\u03b8(tw ) = \u03b8\u2032 (tw\u2032 ).\nQ\nProof. Let t = (tw )w\u2208W \u2208 w\u2208W KTFw . Since for all w \u2208 W , KTFw is split commutative and semi-simple, the idempotents of KTFw form a K-basis of KTFw , and we\nQ\nP\nmay write t = w\u2208W g\u2208Tw\u2217F \u2217 \u03b1gTw e\u03c7Tg , where \u03b1gTw \u2208 K.\nNow, from Proposition 3.2 we have that t \u2208 Im K CurG if and only if, whenever\n\u2217\ng, g \u2032 are rationally conjugate semi-simple elements of G\u2217F , then for any w, w \u2032 \u2208 W\n\u2217\n\u2217\nT\nsuch that g \u2208 T\u2217F and g \u2032 \u2208 T\u2032\u2217F , we have \u03b1gTw = \u03b1g\u2032 w\u2032 . On the other hand,\n\u2217\nTw\nw\nif g \u2208 T\u2217F\n= \u03c7T\nw , then \u03b1g\ng (tw ). The result follows from the definition of the\nequivalence relation on S G .\n\u0003\n\n3.B. Symmetrizing form. The O-algebra HG is symmetric. In particular, the Oalgebra Im CurG is symmetric (see Corollary 3.3). We shall give in this subsection\na precise formula for the symmetrizing form on Im CurG . For this, we introduce the\nfollowing symmetrizing form\nY\n\u03c4\u0303 :\nKTFw \u2212\u2192\nK\nw\u2208W\n\n(xw )w\u2208W\n\n7\u2212\u2192\n\n1 X\n\u03c4w (xw ),\n|W | w\u2208W\n\nwhere \u03c4w : KTFw \u2192 K is the canonical symmetrizing form.\nWe denote by \u03c4 : OGF \u2192 O the canonical symmetrizing form. We denote by \u03c4H\nthe restriction of |UFG |\u03c4 to HG : it is a symmetrizing form on HG (recall that |UFG |\nis invertible in O and is the highest power of p dividing |GF |). Note that\n\u03c4H (e\u03c8 ) = 1.\nOf course, the extension\nhave\n(3.5)\n\nK \u03c4H\n\n: KHG \u2192 K is a symmetrizing form on KHG . We\nK \u03c4H\n\n= \u03c4\u0303 \u25e6 K CurG .\n\nProof. Since \u03c4w is a class function on TFw , we have, by Remark 2.6,\n1 X G\n\u03c4\u0303 ( K CurG (h)) =\nR (\u03c4w )(h)\n|W | w\u2208W Tw\n\n\fEndomorphism algebras of Gelfand-Graev representations\n\nfor all h \u2208 KHG . But, by [DM, Proposition 12.9 and Corollary 12.14], we have\n1 X G\nRTw (\u03c4w ) = |UFG |\u03c4.\n|W | w\u2208W\n\nThis completes the proof of the formula 3.5.\n\n15\n\n\u0003\n\n3.C. On the image of CurG . We are not able to determine in general the sub-OQ\nalgebra Im(CurG ) of w\u2208W OTFw . Of course, we have\nY\n\u0001\n(3.6)\nIm(CurG ) \u2282 Im( K CurG ) \u2229\nOTFw .\nw\u2208W\n\nHowever, there are cases where this inclusion is an equality:\n\nTheorem 3.7. If l does not divide the order of W , then\nY\n\u0001\nIm(CurG ) = Im( K CurG ) \u2229\nOTFw .\nw\u2208W\n\nProof. Let A be the image of CurG . Then, since HG is a symmetric algebra (with\nsymmetrizing form \u03c4H ), it follows from 3.5 that A is a symmetric algebra (with\nsymmetrizing form \u03c4\u0303A , the restriction of \u03c4\u0303 to A).\n\u0001\nQ\nF\nNow, let B = Im( K CurG ) \u2229\nw\u2208W OTw . If l does not divide |W |, then the\nrestriction of \u03c4\u0303 to B defines a map \u03c4\u0303B : B \u2192 O. By construction, we have A \u2282 B \u2282\nKA. So the result follows from Lemma 3.8 below.\n\u0003\nLemma 3.8. Let (A, \u03c4 ) be a symmetric O-algebra and let B be a subring of KA\nsuch that A \u2282 B and K \u03c4 (B) \u2282 O. Then A = B.\nProof. Let (a1 , . . . , an ) be an O-basis of A and let (a\u22171 , . . . , a\u2217n ) denote the dual OP\nbasis of A (with respect to \u03c4 ). Then, for all h \u2208 KA, we have h = ni=1 K \u03c4 (ha\u2217i )ai .\nNow, if moreover h \u2208 B, then ha\u2217i \u2208 B for all i, so K \u03c4 (ha\u2217i ) \u2208 O. So h \u2208 A.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.9 - If l does not divide the order of W , then the Sylow l-subgroups of\nGF are abelian. If GF = SL2 (Fq ), if q is odd and if l = 2, then the inclusion 3.6 is\nstrict. If GF = GL3 (F2 ) and if l = 3, then l divides |W | but the Sylow 3-subgroups\nof GF are abelian: in this case, a brute force computation shows that the inclusion\n3.6 is an equality. This suggests the following question: do we have an equality in\n3.6 if and only if the Sylow l-subgroups of GF are abelian?\nBy Corollary 3.4 and Theorem 3.7, we get:\nQ\nCorollary 3.10. Let t = (tw ) \u2208 w\u2208W OTFw and assume that l does not divide the\norder of W . Then t \u2208 Im CurG if and only if, for all (w, \u03b8), (w \u2032 , \u03b8\u2032 ) \u2208 S G such that\n(w, \u03b8) \u2261 (w \u2032 , \u03b8\u2032 ), we have \u03b8(tw ) = \u03b8\u2032 (tw\u2032 ).\n\n\fC.

Let h \u2208 KHG and assume that l does not divide the order of W .\nF\nThen h \u2208 HG if and only if K CurG\nT (h) \u2208 OT for all F -stable maximal tori of G.\nThe next result has been announced at the beginning of \u00a72.C.\nCorollary 3.12. If L is an F -stable Levi subgroup of a parabolic subgroup of G and\nG\nL\nif l does not divide the order of W , then K CurG\nL (H ) \u2282 H .\nProof. Let h \u2208 HG and let h\u2032 = K CurG\nL (h). By Corollary 3.11, it is sufficient to\nL\n\u2032\nF\nshow that K CurT (h ) \u2208 OT for all F -stable maximal torus T of L. But this follows\nfrom the transitivity of the Curtis maps (see Proposition 2.2) and from the fact that\nG\nG\nF\n\u0003\nK CurT (H ) \u2282 OT (see Theorem 2.7).\n\n3.D. Truncation at unipotent blocks. We keep the notation introduced in \u00a72.D:\nfor instance, bG denotes the sum of the unipotent blocks of GF .\nTheorem 3.13. Assume that l does not divide the order of W . Let S denote a\nSylow l-subgroup of GF and let T denote a maximally split F -stable maximal torus\nof CG (S). Then CurG\nT induces an isomorphism\nbG HG \u2243 (OTF bT )NGF (T) \u2243 (OS)NGF (S) .\nProof. First, since l does not divide the order of W , S is contained in some maximal\ntorus and the centralizer CG (S) is an F -stable Levi subgroup of a parabolic subgroup\nof G. In particular, S is abelian, TF contains S and S is a Sylow l-subgroup of\nTF . This implies that NGF (T) \u2282 NGF (S). Moreover, if n \u2208 NGF (S), then nT is\nanother maximally split maximal torus of CG (S) so there exists g \u2208 CGF (S) such\nthat nT = gT. This shows that\n(1)\n\nNGF (S) = NGF (T).CGF (S).\n\nThis also implies that the map OS \u2192 OTF bT , x 7\u2192 xbT induces an isomorphism\n(OTF bT )NGF (T) \u2243 (OS)NGF (S) .\nG G\nSo we only need to show that CurG\n\u2243\nT induces an isomorphism of algebras b H\nF T NGF (T)\n(OT b )\n.\nG G\nF T NGF (T)\nNow, by 2.8, we have that CurG\n. So it remains to\nT (b H ) \u2282 (OT b )\nG\nG G\nprove that CurT is injective on b H and that the above inclusion is in fact an\nequality.\nG G\n\u2217\n\u2217\nLet us first prove that CurG\nT is injective on b H . Let T denote an F -stable\n\u2217\nmaximal torus which is dual to T. Let S \u2217 denote the Sylow l-subgroup of T\u2217F .\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\nThen |GF | = |G\u2217F | and |TF | = |T\u2217F | so S \u2217 is a Sylow l-subgroup of G\u2217F . In\n\n\fEndomorphism algebras of Gelfand-Graev representations\n\n17\n\nparticular, every l-element of G\u2217F is conjugate to an element of S \u2217 . So K CurG\nT is\nG\nG\ninjective on b KH , as desired.\n\u2217\nMoreover, since S \u2217 is abelian, two elements of S \u2217 are conjugate in G\u2217F if and\nonly if they are conjugate under NG\u2217F \u2217 (S \u2217 ) that is, if and only if they are conjugate\nunder NG\u2217F \u2217 (T\u2217 ): indeed, by the same argument used above for proving (1), we\nhave\n\u2217\n\nNG\u2217F \u2217 (S \u2217 ) = NG\u2217F \u2217 (T\u2217 ).CG\u2217 (S \u2217 ).\n\n(1\u2217 )\nIn particular,\n\nG G\nG\nK CurT (b KH )\n\n(2)\n\n= (KTF bT )NGF (T) .\n\nSo, by (2), we only need to prove that,\n(?)\n\nif h \u2208 bG KHG is such that\n\nG\nK CurT (h)\n\n\u2208 OTF , then h \u2208 bG HG .\n\nWe shall prove (2) by induction on dim G, the case where dim G = dim T being\nF\ntrivial. So let h \u2208 bG KHG be such that K CurG\nT (h) \u2208 OT . Let w \u2208 W . By\nF\nCorollary 3.11, we only need to show that K CurG\nTw (h) \u2208 OTw .\nLet Sw denote the Sylow l-subgroup of TFw . Since S is a Sylow l-subgroup of GF ,\nwe may, and we will, assume that Sw \u2282 S. Now, let L = CG (Sw ). Since Sw is an\nl-subgroup and l does not divide the order of W , L is an F -stable Levi subgroup of\na parabolic subgroup of G. Moreover, we have T \u2282 L and Tw \u2282 L.\n\u2032\nL\nL\nNow, let h\u2032 = K CurG\nL (h). Then h \u2208 b KH (see 2.8) and, by hypothesis, we\nF\n\u2032\nL L\nhave K CurLT (h\u2032 ) = K CurG\nT (h) \u2208 OT . So, if dim L < dim G, then h \u2208 b H by\nL\n\u2032\nF\ninduction hypothesis, and so K CurG\nTw (h) = K CurTw (h ) \u2208 OTw , as desired. This\nmeans that we may, and we will, assume that L = G (or, in other words, that Sw is\ncentral in G). This implies in particular that Sw is the Sylow l-subgroup of Z(G)F .\nMoreover, since l does not divide |W |, it does not divide |Z(G)/Z(G)\u25e6 |, so Sw is the\n\u2217\n\u25e6 F\n\u2217 \u25e6 F\u2217\nSylow l-subgroup of (Z(G)\u25e6 )F . Since |TFw | = |T\u2217F\nw | and |(Z(G) ) | = |(Z(G ) ) |,\n\u2217\nthe Sylow l-subgroup of T\u2217F\n(which we shall denote by Sw\u2217 ) is central in G\u2217 .\nw\nSo, let us write\nX\nh=\nas e\u03c7G\ne\u03c8 .\ns\n\u2217F \u2217 /\u223c\n(s)\u2208Gsem\n\ns is an l-element\n\nThen, by hypothesis,\nX\n\nas e\u03c7Ts \u2208 OTF .\n\ns\u2208S \u2217\n\nIn other words, we have, for all t \u2208 TF ,\n1 X\n(3)\nas \u03c7T\ns (t) \u2208 O.\n|S| s\u2208S \u2217\n\n\fC.

K \u2206G\nl is a unitary map of commutative split semi-simple algebras, hence is\nsurjective if and only if the image of any primitive idempotent is either a primitive\nidempotent or 0. Similarly, K \u2206G\nl is injective if the image of every idempotent is\nnon-zero. Both parts of the proposition are now immediate from Corollary 4.3. \u0003\nLet Z(G) denote the finite group Z(G)/Z(G)\u25e6 . The following corollary is related\nto [CS, Lemma 6]:\nCorollary 4.6. Let r denote the order of the automorphism of Z(G)l induced by\nF . If gcd(d, rl) = 1, then K \u2206G\nl is surjective.\nProof. The proof is somewhat similar to the proof of [CS, Lemma 6]: since our\nsituation is a bit different and since our hypothesis is slightly weaker, we shall recall\n\u2217\na proof. Let s and t be two l-elements of G\u2217F and assume that they are conjugate\n\u2217d\nin G\u2217F . By Proposition 4.5 (a), we only need to show that they are conjugate in\n\u2217\nG\u2217F .\n\u2217d\n\u25e6\nSo let g \u2208 G\u2217F be such that t = gsg \u22121. Let A = CG\u2217 (s)/CG\n\u2217 (s) and let \u03c3 denote\n\u2217\nthe automorphism of A induced by F . We set \u00c3 = A\u22ca < \u03c3 >. It is a classical fact\nthat A is an l-group (since s is an l-element: see for instance [BrM, Lemma 2.1])\nand that there is an injective morphism A \u0592\u2192 Z(G)\u2227 commuting with the actions of\n\n\fC. Bonnaf\u00e9 & R. Kessar\n\n22\n\nthe Frobenius endomorphisms (see for instance [B3, 8.4]). In particular, the order\nof \u03c3 divides r. So gcd(d, \u00c3) = 1. Therefore, the map \u00c3 \u2192 \u00c3, x 7\u2192 xd is bijective.\nNow, since s and t are F \u2217 -stable, the element h = g \u22121F \u2217 (g) belongs to CG\u2217 (s).\n\u2217d\nWe denote by x its class in A. The fact that g belongs to G\u2217F implies that\nhF \u2217 (h) * * * F \u2217d\u22121 (h) = 1. So x\u03c3(x) * * * \u03c3 d\u22121 (x) = 1. In other words, (x\u03c3)d = \u03c3 d . So\n\u25e6\nx = 1. In other words, g \u22121 F \u2217 (g) \u2208 CG\n\u2217 (s). By Lang's Theorem, this implies that s\n\u2217\n\u2217F\nand t are conjugate in G .\n\u0003\nd\n\nCorollary 4.7. If l does not divide [GF : GF ], then\n\nG\nK \u2206l\n\nis injective.\n\n\u2217\n\nProof. This follows from the fact that |GF | = |G\u2217F | (and similarly for F d ) and\nfrom proposition 4.5.\n\u0003\nLet us make a brief comment on this last result. If r denotes the order of the\nautomorphism induced by F on Z(G)l (as in Corollary 4.6), it is not clear if the\nd\ncondition that l does not divide [GF : GF ] implies that d is prime to r. However,\none can easily get the following result:\nd\n\nLemma 4.8. If l divides |GF | and does not divide [GF : GF ], then l does not\ndivide d.\nl\n\nProof. It is sufficient to show that, if l divides |GF |, then l divides [GF : GF ]. For\nthis, let q0 = q 1/\u03b4 (recall that F \u03b4 is a Frobenius endomorphism on G with respect\nto some Fq -structure on G). We denote by \u03c6 the automorphism of V = X(T) \u2297Z K\nsuch that F = q0 \u03c6. Then \u03c6 normalizes W so the invariant algebra S(V \u2217 )W can be\ngenerated by homogeneous polynomials f1 ,. . . , fn (where n = dimK V = dim T)\nwhich are eigenvectors of \u03c6. Let di denote the degree of fi and let \u03b5i \u2208 K \u00d7 be such\nthat \u03c6(fi ) = \u03b5i fi . Then\nn\nY\n|\u03a6+ |\nF\n(q0di \u2212 \u03b5i )\n|G | = q0\ni=1\n\nl\n\nl|\u03a6+ |\n\n|GF | = q0\n\nand\n\nn\nY\n(q0ldi \u2212 \u03b5li ).\ni=1\n\nIn particular, we have\nFl\n\n[G\n\nF\n\n:G ]=\n\n(l\u22121)|\u03a6+ |\nq0\n\nn\nY\n\nd (l\u22121)\n\n(q0 i\n\nd (l\u22122)\n\n+ q0 i\n\n\u03b5i + * * * + q0di \u03b5il\u22122 + \u03b5il\u22121 ).\n\ni=1\n\nView this last equality in O (and recall that l denotes the maximal ideal of O).\nNow, if l divides |GF |, there exists i such that\nq0di \u2261 \u03b5i\n\nmod l.\n\nTherefore,\nd (l\u22121)\n\nq0 i\n\nd (l\u22122)\n\n+ q0 i\n\n\u03b5i + * * * + q0di \u03b5il\u22122 + \u03b5il\u22121 \u2261 l\u03b5il\u22121 \u2261 0 mod l.\n\n\fEndomorphism algebras of Gelfand-Graev representations\nl\n\nThis shows that [GF : GF ] \u2208 l \u2229 Z = lZ.\n\n23\n\n\u0003\n\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nIf K \u2206G\nl (b(d) H(d) ) \u2282 b(1) H(1) , we denote by \u2206l : b(d) H(d) \u2192 b(1) H(1) the induced\nmap. This happens for instance if l does not divide |W | (see Theorem 4.4).\nd\n\nG\nG\nG\nG\nTheorem 4.9. If l does not divide |W | * [GF : GF ], then \u2206G\nl : b(d) H(d) \u2192 b(1) H(1)\nis an isomorphism of algebras.\n\nProof. By Theorem 4.4, the map \u2206G\nl is well-defined. By Corollary 4.7, it is injective.\nSo it remains to show that it is surjective.\nFirst, the order of Z(G) divides the order of W . So, since l does not divide the\norder of W , we get that Z(G)l = 1. So, by Corollary 4.6, the map K \u2206G\nl is surjective.\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nSo, if h \u2208 b(1) H(1) , there exists h\u0303 \u2208 b(d) KH(d) such that K \u2206l (h\u0303) = h. So it remains\nG\nto show that h\u0303 \u2208 bG\n(d) H(d) .\nLet S be a Sylow l-subgroup of GF . By hypothesis, it is a Sylow l-subgroup of\nd\nGF . Let T be a maximally split F -stable maximal torus of CG (S) (as in Theorem\nG\n3.13). Let t\u0303 = K CurG\nT,(d) (h\u0303) and t = K CurT,(1) (h). Then, by Proposition 4.1, we\nhave\nt = K NT\nF d /F (t\u0303)\nand, by 2.8,\nd\n\nt\u0303 \u2208 KTF bT\n(d)\n\nand\n\nt \u2208 KTF bT\n(1) .\n\nAlso, by the statement (?) of the proof of Theorem 3.13, it is sufficient to show that\nd\nt\u0303 \u2208 OTF bT\n(d) .\nP\nP\nWrite t\u0303 = z\u0303\u2208TF d az\u0303 z\u0303 and t = z\u2208TF bz z with az\u0303 \u2208 K and bz \u2208 O. Let H be\nthe kernel of the group homomorphism NT\nF d /F . By hypothesis, S is also a Sylow ld\nFd\nFd\nsubgroup of T . So l does not divide [T : TF ] = |H|. Now, if z\u0303 \u2208 TF , and if we\nP\nFd T\nset z = NT\nF d /F (z\u0303), then bz =\nh\u2208H ahz\u0303 . But, since t\u0303 \u2208 KT b(d) , we have ahz\u0303 = az\u0303\nd\nfor every h \u2208 H (in fact, for every l\u2032 -element h of TF ). So |H|az\u0303 = bz \u2208 O, which\nmeans that az\u0303 \u2208 O since |H| is invertible in O.\n\u0003\nAcknowledgements.
