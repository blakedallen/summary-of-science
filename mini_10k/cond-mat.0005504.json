We solve exactly the\nproblem of a nonlinear impurity in a linear host and we obtain a Bruggeman-like formula for the\neffective nonlinear susceptibility. This formula reduces to the usual Bruggeman effective medium\napproximation in the linear case and has the following features: (i) It reproduces the weak contrast\nexpansion to the second order and (ii) the effective medium exponent near the percolation threshold\nare s = 1, t = 1 + \u03ba, where \u03ba is the nonlinearity exponent. Finally, we give analytical expressions\nfor previously numerically calculated quantities.\n\neffective medium approximation (EMA) for this type of\nmedia. A good EMA should satisfy the two following\ncriteria. (i) It should reproduces the weak-contrast expansion (at least up to the second order) and the dilute\nlimit (although this last condition is probably very difficult to fullfill for strongly nonlinear media). (ii) Close\nto the percolation threshold pc , the effective nonlinear\nsusceptibility \u03c7e is described by two exponents: For a\nmetal/insulator mixture, one has [21,22]\n\nThe study of the properties of linear heterogeneous media (composites, suspensions) has been the subject of an\nintense activity for already fifty years (see the reviews [1]\nand [2]). More recently there has been a great interest in\nnon-linear media [2]. The nonlinear composites are important for technology and also from a fundamental point\nof view, for which it is important and challenging to understand the interplay between nonlinearity and disorder.\nThere are essentially two types of nonlinear media. (a)\nWeak nonlinearity: the nonlinearity is small compared to\nthe linear term. This case was studied by many authors\nand is now relatively well understood [3\u201311].(b) Strong\nnonlinearity: the nonlinearity is here the dominant term\nand this can happen in essentially two situations. First,\nthere can be a sharp threshold between two different behaviors and this case can model the phenomena of fracture or dielectric breakdown [12,13]. Second, the constitutive law can be a pure power law of the form\nj = \u03c7|E|\u03ba E\n\n\u03c7e \u223c (p \u2212 pc )t(\u03ba)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere p is the proportion of the conducting component.\nFor a superconductor/metal mixture, one expects\n\u03c7e \u223c (pc \u2212 p)\u2212s(\u03ba)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere p is here the proportion of the superconducting component. Differents values for these exponents\nwere proposed. In [22], the effective medium values are\nt(\u03ba) = 1 + \u03ba and s(\u03ba) = 1, and in [23,24], the exponents\nare t(\u03ba) = s(\u03ba) = 1 + \u03ba/2. In both cases, the crossover\nexponent \u03c6 = s + t is equal to 2 + \u03ba. These two sets\nof exponents satisfy the duality relation for d = 2 [21]:\nt(\u03b3) = \u03b3s(1/\u03b3) where \u03b3 = 1+\u03ba. So far, numerical results\n[25] and series analysis [26] suggests that for d = 2 the\nexponents s and t are different, ruling out s = t = 1+\u03ba/2\nalthough further numerical studies are necessary to make\na definitive statement. An acceptable EMA should predict such kind of values.\nWe can distinguish two differents classes of approaches\nto this problem. A first approach [7,24,27\u201331] consists in\nexpressing the effective nonlinear susceptibility in terms\nof the averaged electric field in each component. In\n[24,27\u201329], a kind of a \"decoupling approximation\" is\nproposed for calculating these fields, and one obtains\na set of coupled equations which is solved numerically.\nAlthough the agreement with numerical simulations is\ngenerally fairly good, there are a few drawbacks to this\nmethod. In particular, this method relies quite heavily\non numerics and it is difficult to check some analytical\nproperties. Moreover, the weak-contrast expansion (condition (i)) is usually not recovered and the exponents are\n\n(1)\n\nwhere j is the current and E the electric field. This behavior can be observed in a dielectric illuminated by a\nLaser [2] when the multiphoton processes dominates and\nthe usual linear approximation completely breaks down.\nCertain cermets resistors, ZnO based varistors [14,15] or\ndisordered alloys [16] can also display this behavior (1).\nIn a disordered medium, the nonlinear susceptibilities\n\u03c7 can fluctuate from point to point and one is interested\nin the macroscopic effective behavior of such a medium.\nIf the nonlinearity exponent \u03ba is the same for all phases\nof the medium, then the effective nonlinear susceptibility is well-defined and is given by j0 = \u03c7e |E0 |\u03ba E0 where\nj0 and E0 are the macroscopic current and electric field\nrespectively. It is difficult to evaluate \u03c7e and devising a\nreliable method to compute \u03c7e would allow one to study\na variety of other problems such as fracture or dielectric\nbreakdown.\nIn this strongly nonlinear case, Blumenfeld and\nBergman obtained the weak contrast expansion to second order [17]. This expansion was recovered by means\nof a path integral method [18]. The dilute limit was studied in [19,20]. Problems arise when one tries to find an\n1\n\n\fdifficult to estimate. In particular, the mean-field theory\nproposed in [24] does not reproduce the weak contrast expansion but instead the lower bound established by Ponte\nCasta\u00f1eda et al [7]. In this case [24], the values of the exponents are s = t = \u03ba/2 + 1. In another series of papers\n[30,31], the nonlinear host is linearized up to the second\norder and the local electric fields are computed in a selfconsistent way. With this method, Ponte Casta\u00f1eda and\nKailasam [30] proposed an effective medium approximation which reproduces the weak contrast expansion, but\nfor which the exponents are difficult to estimate.\nThe second approach is in the Bruggeman spirit [32]\nand consists essentially in considering an impurity in an\neffective host. Bruggeman's theory was reformulated in\norder to apply to this problem [22] and it was further investigated by different authors [25,33\u201335]. This approach\npredicts the effective medium values s = 1 and t = 1 + \u03ba\nand reproduces the weak contrast expansion to second\norder. However, all the studies so far are mostly numerical and we propose here the analytical solution. The\nobtained formula is relatively simple and satisfies conditions (i) and (ii). We give the analytical expressions\nfor numerically estimated quantities [25,33,35]. The only\ndrawback of our result is that the percolation threshold\ndepends on \u03ba (in the same way as in [35]). In the discussion, we address this point and propose a possible way to\ncorrect this wrong behavior.\nThe constitutive relation is j = \u03c7(r)|E|\u03ba E and the\nlocal energy density associated to it is\nw(r, E(r)) =\n\n\u03c7(r)\n|E|\u03ba+2\n\u03ba+2\n\nThe important quantity to study is thus the 'partition\nfunction'\nZ\n(8)\nZ = D\u0303Ee\u2212\u03b2H\nIn a preceeding paper [18], we made a perturbation\nexpansion up to the second order in disorder and we recovered known results [17]. We also showed in another\npaper [36] how to recover Bruggeman's approximation in\nthe functional framework and we recall briefly the idea.\nWe start from the expression (8)\nR and we add and substract a Gaussian ansatz H0 = dd rw0 (E(r))\nZ\n(9)\nZ = D\u0303Ee\u2212\u03b2H0 e\u2212\u03b2(H\u2212H0 )\nWe expand the second exponential and resum it keeping\nonly the contribution at the same point\n\u0015k\n\u221e \u0014Z\nX\n\u2212\u03b2(H\u2212H0 )\nd\ne\n=\nd r(w(r, E(r)) \u2212 w0 (E(r)))\nk=1\n\nZ\n\ndd r\n\n\u2243\n\nZ\n\nd re\u2212\u03b2[w(r,E(r))\u2212w0 (E(r))]\n\nk=1\n\n[w(r, E(r)) \u2212 w0 (E(r))]\n\nd\n\nk\n\n(10)\n\n(here and in the following, we omit unimportant volume\nfactors and cut-offs). The partition function Z is thus\ngiven by\nZ\nZ\nd\n(11)\nZ \u2243 d r D\u0303Ee\u2212\u03b2H0 e\u2212\u03b2[w(r,E(r))\u2212w0 (E(r))]\n\n(4)\n\nE is the applied field and for a heterogeneous medium\nthe quantitie \u03c7(r) at point r is distributed according to a\nbinary law (a generalization of our method to other types\nof disorder should be without problems)\nP (\u03c7 = \u03c7(r)) = p\u03b4(\u03c7 \u2212 \u03c71 ) + q\u03b4(\u03c7 \u2212 \u03c72 )\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u2243\n\nThe following physical picture can be associated with\nthis approximation. The background is described by\nH0 and at point r there is an impurity described by\nw \u2212 w0 . The ideal case would be to take a nonlinear\nbackground described\nby an effective nonlinear susceptiR\n\u03c7e\n|E|\u03ba+2 and a nonlinear impurity, which\nbility H0 = \u03ba+2\nis so far impossible to compute. We thus have to resort\nto a further approximation. The averaged value of the\nelectric field is fixed and given by \u0112 = E0 . It is thus\nreasonable to assume that the electric field in the background will not fluctuate too much (at least far from the\nimpurity) and we can expand the nonlinear background\naround E(r) = E0 . We write E(r) = E0 + \u03b5(r) and\nexpand up to the second order in \u03b5\n\n(5)\n\nThe total dissipated energy is given by W \u2217 =\n\u03c7e |E0 |\u03ba+2 /(\u03ba + 2), and can be expressed as a constrained\nminimum\nZ\nW \u2217 = hmin\u0112=E0 ,E=\u2212\u2207\u03c6 dd rw(r, E(r))i\n(6)\nHere, we have assumed that W \u2217 is a self-averaging quantity in the thermodynamic limit, which allows us to compute the average over the disorder (the brackets h*i denote the average over disorder or equivalently, the spatial\naverage). The minimum in Eq. (6) can be written with\nthe help of path integrals [18]\nZ\n1\n\u2217\nW = lim\u03b2\u2192\u221e \u2212\nD\u0303Ee\u2212\u03b2H\n(7)\n\u03b2\nR\nwhere the \"Hamiltonian\" is H = dd rw(r, E(r)) and\nwhere the measure is D\u0303E = D(E, \u03c6)\u03b4(\u0112 \u2212 E0 )\u03b4(E + \u2207\u03c6).\n\n\u03c7e\nE \u03ba+2 + E0\u03ba E0 * \u03b5(r)\n\u03ba+2 0\nX\nE0i E0j\n1\n\u03b5i (r)(\u03b4ij + \u03ba\n)\u03b5j (r)\n+ E0\u03ba\n2\nE02\ni,j\nw0 \u2243\n\n(12)\n\n\u03c7\n|E|\u03ba+2 .\nwhile we keep the exact expression for w = \u03ba+2\nThe final picture is then the following: we compute exactly the perturbation induced by a nonlinear impurity\nin the nonlinear linearized effective medium. In addition to allow calculations, this scheme ensures that the\n\n2\n\n\fweak-contrast expansion will be recovered. The numerical study of this problem can be found in [25,33,35].\nThe path integral (11) together with the approximation (12) can be computed and after some calculations,\none is led to\nZ\n\u2212\u03b2\u03c7e E0\u03ba+2\nZ \u2243e\ndd ue\u2212\u03b2M(u)\n(13)\n\nIn the linear case (\u03ba = 0), one can easily check that\n(19) reduces to Bruggeman's [32] equation. Moreover, in\nthe one-dimensional case, one recovers the exact result\n1\n1/\u03c7e = h1/\u03c7 \u03ba+1 i\u03ba+1 .\nAs expected, the weak contrast expansion is recovered\nup to the second order, namely\n\u03c7e \u2243 h\u03c7i \u2212\n\nwith\n\u03c7(r) \u03ba+2\nu\n+ \u03c7e E0\u03ba u * E0\n\u03ba+2\n1\nE0 \u2297 E0\n\u03c7e E0\u03ba\n) * (E0 + u)\n(E0 + u) * (1 \u2212 + \u03ba\n+\n2\nI\nE02\n\n(14)\n\nwhere u is a d-dimensional vector.

One can note that u\u2217 is the electric field in the nonlinear impurity embedded in the linearized effective homogeneous host. The effective energy\nW \u2217 = \u2212 \u03b21 hln Zi is then given by W \u2217 = W0 + \u2206W where\n\u03c7e\nE0\u03ba+2 . The natural self-consistent condition\nW0 = \u03ba+2\n\u2206W = 0 can be rewritten for the binary disorder (5)\nunder the form [22,35]\npf (\n\n\u03c7e\n\u03c7e\n) + qf ( ) = 0\n\u03c71\n\u03c72\n\nb\nx\n\n(23)\n\nwhere\n\n1 + 2(\u2212 I1 + \u03ba)\n1\n+1\u2212\n\u03ba+2\n2(1 \u2212 I1 + \u03ba)\n\n1\n\u2212 \u03ba \u03ba+2\n1\n)\n( I 1\n\u03ba+2 1\u2212 I +\u03ba\n\n(24)\n(25)\n\nFor \u03ba = 0, one recovers the known exact expressions\n[22,35]: a = d2 , b = [d/(d \u2212 1)]2 , f (0) = d and\nf (\u221e) = \u2212d/[2(d \u2212 1)] (the function f is defined up to\na constant factor, and there is a global additional factor\n1/(\u03ba + 2) in our result). These four different coefficients\nwere estimated numerically [25,33,35].\nThe percolation threshold is given by\n\n(19)\n\npc =\n\nwhere\n1\n1 v\u2217\u03ba+2\n\u2212\n+ 1 + v\u2217 (x)\nf (x) =\nx\u03ba+2 \u03ba+2\n1\n1\n\u2212 [1 + v\u2217 (x)]2 (1 \u2212 + \u03ba)\n2\nI\n\n(22)\n\nf (0) = \u2212\n\nWe are interested in the large \u03b2 limit [Eq. (7)] so we can\napply the saddle-point method to the integral (13). The\nsaddle point u\u2217 is parallel to E0 and is given by\n\n1\u2212\n\n\u03c71\n)\n\u03c72\n\nwhere q is the fraction of component \u03c72 .\nThe critical behavior is determined by f (x) for x \u2243 0\nand x \u2192 \u221e [22,35]. One obtains from Eqs. (18,20)\n1\nf (x \u2243 0) \u2243 f (0) \u2212 a(\u03ba + 1)x \u03ba+1 where\n\nwhere Sd = 2\u03c0 d /\u0393(d/2) is the surface of the ddimensional sphere. In the linear case, I(d, \u03ba = 0) = 1/d,\nand for d = 2, 3, one has [17,18]\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\nI(2, \u03ba) =\n1\u2212 \u221a\n(16)\n\u03ba\n1+\u03ba\nr\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u03ba\n1\n1 \u2212 \u221a arcsin\n(17)\nI(3, \u03ba) =\n\u03ba\n1+\u03ba\n\u03ba\n\nu\u2217 (x) =\n\n(21)\n\nThis fact is not surprising since we used as an ansatz H0\nthe nonlinear effective medium linearized up to second\norder.\nOur approximation will not reproduce the exact dilute\nlimit, since the nonlinear host is linearized. Instead, we\nwill obtain the following expansion to the first order in\nconcentration (exact for \u03ba = 0)\n\nM(u) =\n\n\u2212E0 (\u03ba \u2212 1I )\n\n\u03ba+2\nh\u03b4\u03c72 iI(d, \u03ba)\n2h\u03c7i\n\n2\nf (\u221e)\n1\nI \u2212\u03ba\n=\nf (\u221e) \u2212 f (0)\n\u03ba + 2 (\u2212 1I + \u03ba)2\n\n(26)\n\nand the exponents are t(\u03ba) = 1 + \u03ba and s(\u03ba) = 1. In\nFig. 1, we compare for d = 3 this exact expression for\npc to numerical results [25,33,35]. It thus seems that the\nvariational method used in [25,33] does not lead to the\ncorrect values of the electric field around the impurity.\nThe fact that the percolation threshold depends on \u03ba is\nthe bad feature of this approximation. However, for \u03ba\nnot too large, or for a contrast not too high this approximation works well. When one adds a linear background\n\n(20)\n\nwhere v\u2217 (x) = u\u2217 (x)/E0 is given by Eq. (18). This equation (19) [together with (18) and (20)] is our main result,\nand we will now discuss it.\n3\n\n\fof effective conductivity \u03c3e , an additional dimensionless\nfactor \u039b = \u03c3e /\u03c7e E0\u03ba is introduced in the equations. Close\nto pc , the effective conductivity behaves as \u03c3e \u223c \u2206p1 and\nthe effective nonlinear susceptibility as \u03c7e \u223c \u2206p1+\u03ba . The\nfactor \u039b is then diverging and the behavior of f is modified. One then recovers the Bruggeman value for the\npercolation threshold pc = 1/d. It thus seems that in the\none-impurity scheme a linear background is necessary to\n\"regularize\" the wrong behavior of pc . It might be a way\nto obtain an EMA satisfying conditions (i) and (ii), and\nwhich gives a correct value for pc .\nAcknowledgements:\nI would like to thank\nD.J. Bergman, Y.-P. Pellegrini, P.
