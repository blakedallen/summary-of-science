The magnitudes of the clumps and the surface brightnesses of the interclump regions are measured and fitted to models of\nstellar age and mass. There is an evolutionary trend from clump clusters with\nno evident interclump emission to clump clusters with faint red disks, to spiral\ngalaxies of the flocculent or grand design types. Along this sequence, the interclump surface density increases and the mass surface density contrast between\nthe clumps and the interclump regions decreases, suggesting a gradual dispersal\nof clumps to form disks. Also along this sequence, the bulge-to-clump mass ratios\nand age ratios increase, suggesting a gradual formation of bulges. All of these\nmorphological types occur in the same redshift range, indicating that the clump\ncluster morphology is not the result of bandshifting. This redshift range also\nincludes clear examples of interacting galaxies with tidal tails and other characteristic features, indicating that clump clusters, which do not have these features,\nare not generally interacting. Comparisons to local galaxies with the same rest\nwavelength and spatial resolution show that clump clusters are unlike local flocculent and spiral galaxies primarily because of the high clump/interclump contrasts\nin the clump clusters. They bear a striking resemblance to local dwarf Irregulars, however. This resemblance is consistent with a model in which the clumpy\nmorphology comes from gravitational instabilities in gas with a high turbulent\nspeed compared to the rotation speed and a high mass fraction compared to the\nstars. The morphology does not depend on galaxy mass as much as it depends\non evolutionary stage: clump clusters are 100 times more massive than local\ndwarfs. The apparent lack of star formation in damped Lyman alpha absorbers\nmay result from fast turbulence.\nSubject headings: galaxies: evolution - galaxies: high-redshift - galaxies: irregular - galaxies: peculiar - galaxies:starburst\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nStar-forming galaxies become increasingly irregular at higher redshift with blue clumpy\nstructure, asymmetry, and a lack of central concentration (Glazebrook et al. 1995; Abraham,\net al. 1996a,b; van den Bergh et al. 1996; Driver et al. 1995, 1998; Im et al. 1999). These\nthree features are included in the CAS classification system (Conselice 2003), which has\nidentified such irregularities in a large fraction of galaxies in deep fields (e.g., Conselice,\nBlackburne, & Papovich 2005; Menanteau et al. 2006). Similar observations of irregular\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nstructures were obtained from color dispersions in high redshift galaxies (Papovich, et al.\n2005), Gini coefficients (Lotz et al. 2006), Sersic indices (Cassata et al. 2005; Ravindranath\net al 2006), UV imaging (de Mello et al. 2006), and various combined methods (e.g., Neichel\net al. 2008).\nThe kinematics of disks at intermediate redshifts also show irregular structures (Erb\net al. 2004; Yang et al. 2008), suggesting an important contribution from unstable gas\ndynamics (Law et al. 2009). Turbulent motions are large compared to the rotation speed\n(F\u00f6rster-Schreiber et al. 2006; Weiner et al. 2006; Genzel et al. 2006, 2008; Puech et al.\n2007), although there can be underlying systematic rotation too (e.g., Bournaud et al. 2008).\nDuring the last few years, we have examined the properties of clumps in high redshift\nirregular galaxies, including chain galaxies (Cowie, Hu, & Songaila 1995) and their likely\nface-on counterparts, the clump-clusters (Elmegreen, Elmegreen, & Hirst 2004), in an effort\nto understand star formation and to look for signs of evolution toward modern Hubble\ntypes. We have determined clump masses and ages from population synthesis models and\nsuggested the clumps form by gravitational instabilities in a gas-rich disk (Elmegreen &\nElmegreen 2005; Bournaud, Elmegreen & Elmegreen 2007, hereafter BEE). The clumps are\ngenerally more massive than star complexes (Efremov 1995) in local galaxies, which suggests\nthat the turbulent speed in the neutral and molecular gas is large as well, perhaps in the\nrange of 20 to 50 km s\u22121 , considering the characteristic mass of a disk instability (and as\nmeasured in a z=1.6 clump cluster, Bournaud et al. 2008). Gas column densities have\nto be large too, around 100 M\u2299 pc\u22122 (Elmegreen, et al. 2009, hereafter EEFL). These\nproperties are reasonable considering the youthful stage of the systems we are studying.\nThe high turbulence may come from gas accretion because it has to be in place before the\nclumps form in order to define the clump mass, and because the star formation feedback that\ngenerates turbulence in local galaxies is relatively ineffective when the velocity dispersion of\nthe whole interstellar medium is large. High dispersion star-forming clouds are tightly bound\nand not easily disrupted by star-formation pressures (Elmegreen, Bournaud, & Elmegreen\n2008). Clumps also produce high velocity dispersions by themselves in the surrounding gas\n(BEE).\nThis interpretation of asymmetric clumpy structure as an indication of instabilities in\na gas-rich disk is not the only possibility. When asymmetry and clumpiness are observed\nin a local L\u2217 galaxy, they are usually indicative of a merger. Faint peripheral structures\nsuch as tails and bridges contribute to this identification locally. As a result, asymmetric\nand clumpy structure in high redshift galaxies has also been considered to be the result of\nmergers (e.g., Conselice et al. 2003, Treu et al. 2005; Lotz et al. 2008; Conselice, Yang,\n& Bluck 2009, and references therein). This interpretation is reinforced by expectations\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nfrom the \u039bCDM model, in which dark matter halos grow by hierarchical merging (Davis\net al. 1985). For example, a recent study by Jogee et al. (2009) suggested that 16% and\n45% of galaxies with stellar masses larger than 2 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 had a major or minor merger,\nrespectively, at redshifts between 0.24 and 0.80. Jogee et al. identified these galaxies as\nmergers based only on their asymmetric and clumpy structure, as determined both by eye\nand by the CAS system. The actual fraction of galaxies that are clumpy in this redshift\nrange is smaller than the Jogee et al. merger fractions, because they, like others, correct the\nobserved fractions upward to compensate for the low fraction of time during which a merger\nmorphology should be visible. L\u00f3pez-Sanjuan et al. (2009) also used the asymmetry index\nfor galaxies in the range 0.35 < z < 0.85 and derived a corrected major merger fraction of\n20%-35% for MB < 20 galaxies.\nThe key assumption for these and other merger interpretations is that baryons come\ntogether in a clumpy fashion like the cold dark matter, and star formation occurs early and\nefficiently in the baryonic clumps, which then merge as little galaxies rather than as smooth\ngaseous flows. Early numerical simulations reinforced this view, although the results of these\nsimulations depended strongly on the recipes for thermal equilibrium and star formation,\nwhich are uncertain. Significant merging is untenable in the instability model of clump\nformation because then the pre-existing stars would make a spheroidal component in the\nremnant (e.g., Abadi et al. 2003), and this component would cause the instabilities to\nappear as spiral arms rather than discrete clumps (Bournaud & Elmegreen 2009).\nOther aspects of galaxies expected from mergers are not generally observed. Law et\nal. (2007) noted that the UV morphology of a galaxy is not related to the star formation\nrate, which led them to conclude that the irregular structure is probably not the result of a\nmerger. Jogee et al. (2009) also found that the star formation rate is not correlated with\ngalaxy morphology. In local gas-rich mergers, even with weak tidal forces, there is usually\na significant increase in the star formation rate compared to isolated galaxies (Larson &\nTinsley 1978; see reviews in Sanders & Mirabel 1996; Kennicutt 1998).\nThe thermodynamics of cosmic gas is the key issue in the theoretical side of this debate.\nWhether the gas, which tends to follow the dark matter, cools enough to form stars in\nclumps before it assembles into M \u2217 galaxies, or instead enters the M \u2217 halos in smooth flows,\ndepends on the balance between atomic collisional cooling and compressional and radiative\nheating. Recent simulations that treat this thermodynamics in detail now seriously question\nthe baryonic merger scenario. Murali et al. (2002) first did cosmological simulations with\nenough resolution to include both large-scale flows and individual galaxies. They found that\ncold flows of unprocessed gas can get directly down to the M \u2217 scale without clumping into\nlittle galaxies first. They suggested that galaxy growth is dominated by smooth flows rather\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nthan mergers of pre-existing galaxies. Birnboim & Dekel (2003) confirmed in spherically\nsymmetric collapse calculations that gas cooling can be faster than compressional heating\nfor low mass galaxies (see also Binney 1977; Kay, et al. 2000), in which case the inflowing\nmaterial does not shock to the dark matter virial temperature. Semelin & Combes (2005)\nfound the same dominance of cold cosmological inflow to a disk, and noted that the final\naccretion tends to align to the disk plane. Dekel & Birnboim (2006) subsequently studied\nthe stability of halo shocks and showed simulations where cold gas streams penetrated the\nhot halos. They found that the maximum halo mass for the cold flows is comparable to the\nmass dividing blue and red galaxies in the local universe and suggested that the difference\nbetween these two types of galaxies is the result of a difference in the gas accretion mode.\nMassive dark matter potentials shock their accreted gas to a high temperature, which slows\nor prevents in situ star formation and tips the balance of processes contributing to stellar\ngrowth in favor of mergers. More recently, Dekel et al. (2009a) showed detailed simulations\nand concluded that 2/3 of the inflow mass is smooth gas accretion and the rest is clumpy\nmerger-like accretion; they concluded that most of the stars in the universe form in the disks\nof massive (> 1011 M\u2299 ) \"stream-fed\" galaxies during the redshift interval from 1.5 to 4.\nDekel et al. (2009b) and Agertz, Teyssier, & Moore (2009) now find that cold flows can lead\nto the formation of clumpy galaxies via gravitational instabilities in the accreted disks.\nFollowing Murali et al. (2002), the same team now led by Kere et al. (2005) also\ndid SPH simulations in a cosmological context. They showed that accretion to low mass\ngalaxies (baryonic mass < 1010.3 M\u2299 ; halo mass < 1011.4 M\u2299 ) along cosmological filaments\nremains cold and gets all the way to the central disk, while high mass galaxies shock-heat the\naccreting gas before it cools. They suggested that because of this mass dependence, the cold\nmode dominates all galaxies at high redshift and is most important for low density galaxies\nat low redshift. Recently, Kere et al. (2009) confirmed these results in a larger simulation\nand suggested that cold flows dominate the star formation rate at all redshifts. In another\nstudy, Ocvirk, Pichon, & Teyssier (2008) included the effects of metallicity. They derived the\nsame threshold mass for virial shocks as the other groups but suggested that the threshold\nmass for cold flow penetration of hot halos increases with redshift as a result of changes in\nthe metal-dominated cooling rate. At higher resolution, Brooks et al. (2009) were able to\nstudy the time development of a galaxy disk subject to shocked and unshocked inflows and\nto mergers of smaller galaxies in a cosmological context. They found that unshocked gas\nbuilds the disk much faster than shocked gas, which eventually accretes slowly and for long\ntimes after cooling. In their model for a galaxy the size of the Milky Way, the fraction of\nthe disk stars coming from merged galaxies is small, \u223c 25%.\nThe distinction between clumpy disk structure that results from gravitational instabilities in a highly turbulent interstellar medium and clumpy disk structure that results from the\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nmerger of two or more galaxies should be evident at moderate-to-low redshifts in the Great\nObservatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS; Giavalisco et al. 2004) and Galaxy Evolution\nfrom Morphology and SEDs (GEMS; Rix et al. 2004) fields. These surveys have exposure\ntimes that highlight the z < 1 universe and are large enough to contain the relevant types\nas well as rare intermediate cases. Galaxies with asymmetric clumps, galaxies with double\ncores and tidal features (Elmegreen et al. 2007b), and galaxies with smooth spiral arms, are\nall present in GEMS and GOODS over the same redshift range. This mixture minimizes the\nbias from bandshifting and surface brightness dimming.\nWith this in mind, we searched GEMS and GOODS for clump clusters, chain galaxies,\nand spiral galaxies. For the clump clusters and face-on spirals, we measured the magnitudes\nof star-forming clumps and their adjacent interclump regions in the available ACS passbands.\nFor the chains and edge-on spirals, we measured the thicknesses of the disks. There is\ngenerally an evolution toward smaller clumps and smoother disks at lower redshifts. The\nrelative number of combined clump clusters and chains found in GOODS and GEMS is only\n\u223c 10% compared to spiral galaxies, while it is \u223c50% in the UDF out to z \u223c 4 (Elmegreen et\nal. 2005). We also found evidence for a progression in relative clump mass, surface density,\nand age along the morphological sequence from clumpy systems with no visible interclump\nstars, to clumpy systems with red underlying disks, to spirals with relatively smooth disks.\nThis is the same evolutionary trend found in the UDF for more distant galaxies (EEFL). The\ntrend seems to illustrate how modern disks and bulges form from the evolution, migration,\nand dispersal of star-forming clumps.\nThe motivation in other studies to interpret high-redshift clumpy asymmetric galaxies as\nmerger remnants stems primarily from the analogous morphology of local merger remnants,\nas discussed above. However, there is another type of local galaxy with this morphology\nthat is not a merger remnant, the dwarf Irregular. We consider in Sections 5 and 6.3 the\npossibility that the internal structure of high-redshift clumpy galaxies is a scaled-up version\nof that in local dwarf Irregulars. The local dwarfs get their clumpy structure from large\nvalues of two dimensionless quantities: the relative gas fraction in the disk and the relative\nlength scale for disk gravitational instabilities. The large unstable length compared to the\ndisk radius follows from another dimensionless quantity, the ratio of the gas turbulent speed\nto the galaxy rotation speed. In the case of dwarf Irregulars, the large value for this speed\nratio is the result of a low rotation speed (50\u2212100 km s\u22121 ) combined with a normal turbulent\nspeed (\u223c 10 km s\u22121 ). If high redshift galaxies have an equally large ratio, then it would arise\nfrom a high turbulent speed at the normal rotation speed in an M \u2217 galaxy.\nThe disk instability model for clump formation also requires the gas accretion rate to\nbe larger than the star formation rate for at least an orbit time. Otherwise, star formation\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nwould reduce the gas density and make the layer more stable. Such high temporary rates\ncould be the result of irregular inflows, where the gas and dark matter enter a galaxy in\nseparate bursts. Clumpy disks form or reform after the most recent gas accretion event.\nSuch a dependence between morphology and accretion history may explain why clumpy\ndisks exist over a wide range of redshifts (Elmegreen et al. 2007a); i.e., clumpy structure\nat late times could be initiated by a recent gas accretion event. Murali et al. (2002) also\nconsider late-time galaxy formation by recent cold flows. Evidence for late stage galaxy\nformation was presented by Noeske et al. (2007), based on the star formation rate versus\nmass for different redshifts.\nIn what follows, the data used for the analysis of GOODS images are described in\nSection 2, the clump masses, surface densities, ages, and star formation rates are discussed\nin Section 3, and the disk thicknesses are in Section 4. Section 5 makes a comparison between\ntwo clumpy, high-redshift galaxies and a local flocculent galaxy observed with the same rest\nwavelength and convolved to the same spatial resolution, and another similar comparison\nbetween a high redshift galaxy and a local dwarf Irregular. The local flocculent is clearly\ndifferent from clump cluster galaxies in terms of the clump-to-interclump mass contrast and\nbrightness contrast, but the local dwarf Irregular is indistinguishable except for a factor\nof \u223c 30 in mass. A discussion of the implications of our study is in Section 6: Section\n6.1 reviews clump origins and trends with redshift, Section 6.2 considers clump coalescence\nto make a bulge, Section 6.3 explores further the analogy with local dwarf Irregulars, and\nSection 6.4 offers a solution to the lack of star formation in damped Lyman alpha absorbers.\nThe conclusions are in Section 7.\n\n2.\n\nData, Morphology, and General Implications of the Morphology\n\nThe GOODS survey comprises images of 18 ACS fields surrounding the UDF in 4\npassbands, B435 , V606 , and i775 , and z850 to z \u223c 1.5. We searched all of these fields for\nclumpy galaxies of various types and selected \u223c 100 for closer study. We also searched 5\nGOODS fields for spiral galaxies and selected representative cases to cover the same redshift\nrange as the clumpy galaxies. Examination of the clump cluster images suggested that some\nwere questionable as individual galaxies: some could be foreground-background pairs and\nothers could be interacting galaxies with tidal features. These were rejected from the current\nstudy. Galaxies that were too highly inclined to measure or distinguish the clumps were also\nrejected. This left a sample of 93 galaxies: 26 spirals with clear spiral arms and bulges,\n35 flocculent spirals with central red bulges, 15 clump clusters without central red bulges\nbut with an underlying red disk, and 17 clump clusters with neither central red bulges nor\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nobvious underlying disks. Disk vertical scale heights were measured in an additional 62\nchains and edge-on spirals from GOODS.\nThe GEMS survey consists of 63 fields surrounding the GOODS fields to slightly shallower depths (z \u223c 1.2) in 2 passbands (V606 and z850 ). We selected a sample of 166 edge-on\nspirals and chain galaxies larger than 10 pixels in diameter and measured their perpendicular\nscale heights. We also selected a sample of 213 clump clusters and measured 810 star-forming\nclumps. Because the accuracy of the population synthesis fits is lower with only two passbands in GEMS, their measurements were done as a check on the more detailed GOODS\nmeasurements.\nFigure 1 shows four morphologies of GOODS galaxies that are useful for consideration\nhere. On the left are two spiral galaxies that are somewhat normal-looking compared to\nmodern spirals. Next are two galaxies with clumpy star formation and small red bulges.\nThey resemble local flocculent galaxies but have larger and fewer clumps than the local\nanalogs (see Section 5). The galaxies in the third image from the left have clumpy star\nformation without an obvious bulge, but there is still a red underlying disk in each. The two\non the right are clumpy without any obvious underlying disk. These four galaxy types extend\nour previous classifications to more modern systems. In Elmegreen et al. (2005), we classified\ndisk galaxies in the Ultra Deep Field (UDF) as either spirals or clump clusters, considering\nthat a third class, chain galaxies, represents an edge-on version of the clump clusters. All\nbut the leftmost pair in Figure 1 would have been called clump clusters according to that\nclassification, especially in the UDF where the bulges in the two second-from-the-left galaxies\nwould most likely have been missed because of bandshifting and faintness. The presence of\nbulges in some clump clusters was recognized in EEFL using NICMOS images of the UDF.\nThe three pairs on the right in Figure 1 have classifications like galaxies in that EEFL\npaper: clump clusters with bulge-like clumps, clump clusters with red disks and no bulgelike clumps, and clump clusters without any evident red component. The first of these, the\nflocculent class, has not been distinguished in our high redshift surveys before. These are\nevidently normal disks that have weak or no stellar density waves, like local galaxies with\nthe same appearance.\nFigures 2-5 show more examples of each morphology, presented in order of increasing\nCOMBO17 spectrophotometric redshift (Wolf et al. 2008). The presence of each type over\na wide range of redshifts suggests that clump clusters are not bandshifted spiral galaxies. A\nsimilar redshift comparison was made for 6 morphological classes in the UDF (Elmegreen\net al. 2007a). If the clumpy phase is short-lived, as simulations suggest, then either galaxy\nformation is prolonged so that clumpy galaxies appear even as late at z \u223c 0.1, or clump\nmorphology is transient, possibly following a significant event of gas accretion late in the\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\ngalaxy's life.\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nClump Properties\nMethod of Analysis\n\nThe magnitudes of 373 clumps were measured in four passbands for all of the 93 selected\ngalaxies in GOODS. Measurement was done using the program imstat in the Image Reduction and Analysis Facility (IRAF1 ) with the same field position and size for each passband\n(see discussion in EEFL). Clump boundaries were typically \u223c 10\u03c3 above the noise and measurement errors were \u223c 0.1 mag. Boxes were used to define magnitudes because the clumps\nare pixelated; a typical clump diameter is 3 to 5 pixels with a box shape close to square.\nClump color is much less variable than the clump magnitude. Slight shifts in selecting the\nboundaries of these fields would yield \u223c 0.05 magnitude deviations in the colors.\nWe measured the surface brightnesses of detectable interclump regions that are adjacent\nto the clumps. This was done using the IRAF task pvector , which takes a pixel-wide intensity\ncut through the galaxy, and it was also done using selected rectangular regions with the\nIRAF task imstat. Contours made with the IRAF task contour provided further checks on\nthe interclump brightness. The choice of which interclump region to measure is subjective.\nWe picked regions fairly close to the clumps in most cases, and used the same interclump\nmeasurements for several clumps if there were limited options. Clump clusters are extremely\nclumpy and the surface brightness in the interclump region varies a lot, from something\nthat might be representative of a clump pedestal to something too faint to detect at all.\nBecause we only measured regions considerably above the background noise, there is a lower\nlimit to the intrinsic interclump surface brightness that increases as (1 + z)4 , which is the\ncosmological surface brightness dimming factor.\nFigure 6 shows histograms of the difference between the i775 surface brightness at a level\nof 1\u03c3 noise in the sky and the i775 surface brightness of each interclump region. Solid blue\nlines are for spirals and dashed red lines are for clumpy galaxies of various types. This figure\nindicates that the average interclump region chosen for our study is about 2 mag arcsec\u22122\nabove the 1\u03c3 level of the sky, which is 25.2 mag arcsec\u22122 in the i775 band. This difference\ncorresponds to a factor of 6.3 above the 1\u03c3 noise level. The interclump surface brightness\n1\n\nIRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories, which are operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National\nScience Foundation.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nis 2 to 3 times more accurate than 6.3\u03c3 because each measured interclump region contains\n4 to 10 pixels. The peaked nature of the distribution illustrates the point of the previous\nparagraph; i.e., that most interclump measurements have about the same surface brightness\nabove the background noise level, in which case the intrinsic interclump surface brightness,\nafter correcting for cosmological dimming, increases about as (1 + z)4 .\nThe relative uncertainty per pixel in the surface brightness is approximately the inverse\nsquare root of the counts. We noted above that the clump boundaries are at about the 10\u03c3\nlevel for background noise \u03c3, which makes the average count for the clumps \u223c 20\u03c3, and we\nalso showed that the interclump regions are at an average level of 6.3\u03c3. The ratio of these\ntwo mean intensities is \u223c 3, and the inverse square root of this is \u223c 60%.\nThe flux from each star-forming region was determined by subtracting the surface brightness of the adjacent interclump region from the average surface brightness of the clump, and\nthen multiplying the result by the area of the clump (that is, the area of the box used to\ndetermine the average surface brightness of the clump). Clump colors were determined from\nthe differences between the background-subtracted clump magnitudes. For the purpose of\nunderstanding clump dynamics, the total clump mass, including the older stars inside the\nclump, should be used, but for the purpose of understanding star formation, only the excess\nyoung mass above the background should be used. Our previous studies of clumps in UDF\ngalaxies did not subtract the background disk because it was generally very faint.\nThe observed colors B435 \u2212V606 , V606 \u2212i775 , and i775 \u2212z850 of each background-subtracted\nclump and each interclump region were fitted to three model parameters: age, star formation\ndecay time in an exponentially decaying model, and extinction (see EEFL). We used the stellar evolution models of Bruzual & Charlot (2003) for the Chabrier initial mass function and\na metallicity of 0.008 (equal to 0.4 solar). Estimates of dust absorption used the wavelength\ndependence in Calzetti et al. (2000) with the short-wavelength modification in Leitherer et\nal. (2002), considering as templates six multiples (MA = 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8) of the\nredshift-dependent intrinsic AV in Rowan-Robinson (2003). Corrections to the model spectra\nwere made to account for intervening hydrogen absorption, following Madau (1995). Spectrophotometric redshift measurements come from the COMBO17 survey (Wolf et al. 2003;\n2008). The templates considered decay times of \u03c4 = 107 , 3 \u00d7 107 , 108 , 3 \u00d7 108 , 109 , 3 \u00d7 109\nand 1010 years. Region ages were sampled at every timestep in the Bruzual & Charlot (2003)\ntabulation back to the age at a maximum assumed region formation redshift equal to 10.\nFor each template, the mass was determined from the age and the background-subtracted\nbrightness in the i775 band.\nThe best fit results for age, decay time, extinction, and mass were taken to be the\nexp (\u22120.5\u03c72 )-weighted average values among all solutions, where \u03c72 is the sum of the squares\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nof the observed 3 ACS colors divided by the corresponding measurement errors. Measurement\nerrors were determined for each clump from the total count of emission in that clump, after\nfirst scaling count rms to count value using a large number of sample clumps (there is an\napproximately square root relationship between the count rms and the count value).\nAge and extinction are inversely correlated so each has a relatively large uncertainty,\nbut the effects of these two uncertainties compensate for each other in the determination of\nmass, which is more robust. The mass errors resulting from uncertainties in metallicity and\nextinction are relatively small and were discussed in detail in EEFL. Here we estimate that\nthe derived ages are uncertain (3\u03c3) to within a factor of 4 and the masses are uncertain to\nwithin a factor of 2, based on 3 times the rms in the log of age and mass in the model fits.\nSystematic uncertainties are larger and more difficult to estimate, particularly regarding the\nstar formation history, which is not likely to be as simple as the exponential decay model\nassumed here.\nA potential problem with fitting a number of parameters equal to the number of measurements (three in our case) is that the most insensitive parameter can vary evenly throughout\nthe range and then the weighted average value used for the fit is the average of the range.\nWe checked for this by plotting versus age the restframe B-V color over the redshift range\nfrom 0 to 0.65, which allows interpolation of the observed magnitudes over the ACS bands\nto give the restframe apparent magnitudes mB and mV . Figure 7 shows the result, with\nclump fits on the left and bulge or bulge-like clump fits on the right. There is a correlation,\nindicating that the fitting procedure is giving a sensible age that is younger for intrinsically\nbluer regions. The scatter in the age is about half an order of magnitude for the bluest colors\nand a few tenths of an order of magnitude for the reddest colors. This half magnitude is\nconsistent with the factor of 4 for the 3\u03c3 age error mentioned above. Other tests of the same\nfitting procedure were given in EEFL.\n\n3.2.\n\nResults\n\n3.2.1. Clump Masses\nFigure 8 shows the best-fit masses for the clumps versus the redshifts for galaxy types\nin the four divisions defined in Figure 1. The bulges or bulge-like clumps are indicated by\nopen red squares and the clumps that are not bulge-like are indicated by blue crosses. The\nbulges are generally more massive than the clumps; they are much more massive than the\nclumps in the spiral and flocculent galaxies, while only a little more massive than the clumps\nin the clump clusters. This is consistent with our findings for the UDF discussed in EEFL.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nBeyond redshift z \u223c 0.5, the average logarithms of the non-bulge clump masses (in M\u2299 ) for\nspirals, flocculents, clump clusters with red disks, and clump clusters without red disks are\nrespectively, 7.4 \u00b1 0.4, 7.3 \u00b1 0.4, 7.4 \u00b1 0.5, and 7.4 \u00b1 0.3. The average log bulge masses at\nz > 0.5 for the same galaxy types are 8.9 \u00b1 0.5, 8.2 \u00b1 0.4, 7.9 \u00b1 0.6, and 7.6 \u00b1 0.2. Thus the\nbulges in spirals and flocculents are larger than the clumps by an average factor of 16, while\nthe bulges in the two clumpy types are larger than the clumps by an average factor of only\n2.2. This is consistent with UDF galaxies, where bulges are more similar to clumps in the\nclumpiest galaxies than they are in the more modern morphologies (EEFL).\nThe right-hand side of Figure 8 shows the ratios of the clump or bulge masses to the\nwhole-galaxy pseudo-luminosities, measured as 10\u22120.4Brest for restframe absolute magnitudes\nBrest given in COMBO17 (Wolf et al. 2008). This ratio is convenient for scaling the clump\nmasses to the masses of star-forming regions in local galaxies. The ratio is also useful for\nunderstanding a selection effect evident in the left-hand panels; i.e., the drop in clump mass\nat lower redshift. This drop is not present in the right-hand panels, indicating that the low\nclump masses at low redshift are the result of systematically smaller and fainter galaxies at\nlow redshift, with essentially no change in the clump mass for a galaxy of a given brightness.\nThe decrease in galaxy size for lower redshift is presumably the result of a smaller sampling\nvolume in the universe.\nThe log of the ratio of the clump mass to the galaxy pseudo-luminosity averages \u22121.1 \u00b1\n0.5, \u22120.7 \u00b1 0.5, \u22120.4 \u00b1 0.5, and \u22120.1 \u00b1 0.4 for the spirals, flocculents, clump clusters with red\ndisks, and clump clusters, respectively. For the bulges, the logs of these ratios are higher:\n0.6 \u00b1 0.6, 0.3 \u00b1 0.5, \u22120.1 \u00b1 0.6, and 0.2 \u00b1 0.4. These averages consider all redshifts, so the\ndifferences between the logs for the clumps and bulges in this case are slightly different than\nthe differences for the case of mass given above (which was for z > 0.5). The masses in clump\nclusters are larger than in spirals and flocculents, relative to the galaxy luminosities, by a\nfactor of 10\u22120.1\u2212[\u22121.1\u22120.7]/2 = 6. Relative bulge masses compared to relative clump masses\nare larger in spirals and flocculents than they are in either type of clump cluster by a factor\nof \u223c 11, which is 10 to the power 0.5(0.6 + 0.3 \u2212 [\u22121.1 \u2212 0.7]) \u2212 0.5(\u22120.1 + 0.2 \u2212 [\u22120.4 \u2212 0.1]).\nIn a typical local galaxy with MB \u223c \u221220.3 mag, the largest regions of star formation\ncontain \u223c 105 M\u2299 . In Figure 8, an average galaxy with Brest = \u221220.3 mag has a clump\nmass of 10, 26, 52 and 105 million solar masses for the four galaxy types. These are \u223c 100\nto \u223c 1000 times larger than the largest star-forming regions in local galaxies, and larger still\nif we consider that the same galaxies in GOODS would be fainter today because of stellar\n\u0001\nevolution. Locally, the value of log M/10\u22120.4MB is \u22123.1 if M = 105 M\u2299 and MB = \u221220.3,\nmuch lower than the plotted values in Figure 8.\nSome clumps in GOODS galaxies are 10 or more times larger than these average values,\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nconsidering the upper range of the points in Figure 8. The maximum (non bulge-like) clump\n\u0001\nmasses reach log M/10\u22120.4Brest \u223c 1. At this value, a MB = \u221220.3 mag galaxy would have\na clump mass of 109 M\u2299 . The trend toward higher clump mass with redshift continues in the\nUDF. This trend contains a selection effect determined by the observable limits of surface\nbrightness and physical size. An important question is whether the clumps define a physical\nscale, like a Jeans length, or a blending scale at the limit of resolution in a distribution of\nsmaller clumps. We return to this question in Section 6.1. Most likely, both effects are\npresent: the clumps probably contain unresolved substructure, but the spacings between\nmost giant clumps are resolved well enough to determine the clump luminosities and masses.\nFigure 9 shows masses and mass-to-light ratios for 810 clumps in 213 clump cluster\ngalaxies in the GEMS fields. These masses were estimated from the V606 and z850 filters used\nfor GEMS in the manner described by Elmegreen et al. (2007b). This method makes the\nsame assumptions as in the rest of the current paper, and uses the same Bruzual & Charlot\n(2003) models with exponentially decaying star formation rates. The method works because\nfor any given redshift, all of the ages and decay times in the models give about the same\ntrack on a plot of clump apparent magnitude V606 versus color V606 \u2212 z850 per unit stellar\nmass. These tracks differ for each redshift, so we assign each galaxy to a redshift interval\nof \u2206z = \u00b10.125, where the tracks are determined. Given the clump color on the abscissa\nof the plot, the deviation between the clump apparent magnitude and the track apparent\nmagnitude is proportional to the log of the clump mass. To find the best case, we take the\naverage in the log of clump mass from all of the different tracks, which in fact have only small\ndifferences between them (see Figs. 10 and 11 in Elmegreen et al. 2007b). The error in the\nmass is estimated to be a factor of \u223c 3 from the relative deviations between the tracks. For\nthe GEMS clump masses, we do not subtract the underlying disk light in the V606 and z850\nfilters, as we do for the GOODS masses. As a result, the GEMS masses tend to be larger\nthan the GOODS masses because the clump colors are slightly redder and the clump fluxes\nare slightly larger without background subtraction.\nFigure 9 shows that in GEMS also, the clump masses increase with redshift yet have a\n\u0001\nnearly constant ratio of mass to total galaxy light. The average quantity log M/10\u22120.4Brest\nfor GEMS clumps equals 0.24\u00b10.53, which is larger than the equivalent quantity for GOODS\nclump cluster clumps (\u22120.1 \u00b1 0.4) by 0.3 in the log. This difference corresponds to a factor\nof \u223c 2 in mass, which is not unexpected considering that the background is not subtracted\nfor GEMS clumps.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n3.2.2. Clump Surface Densities\nThe surface density of each clump was determined from its mass and size. The size\nis the area of the region used to measure the clump flux and is usually comparable to the\nsize of the brightest part of the clump. Because of angular resolution limits, each clump\nis likely to have substructure where the surface density is larger than what we derive here.\nEach clump has a nearby interclump region assigned to it, but some clumps share the same\nregion. The surface density of each interclump region was determined from its color and\nsurface brightness assuming the usual conversions between size and magnitude for a \u039bCDM\ncosmology (Carroll, Press & Turner 1992; Spergel et al. 2003). Each fit to the interclump\nsurface density included the mass, age, exponential decay time, and extinction, as for the\nclump fits.\nThe left-hand side of Figure 10 shows the redshift distribution of the excess surface\ndensity of each clump, written as the total in each clump area minus the interclump surface\ndensity. The units are M\u2299 pc\u22122 . Bulges have higher surface densities than clumps by a\nfactor of 10 to 100 for spirals and flocculents, but the two are about the same for clump\nclusters. The right-hand part of the figure shows the interclump surface density for the bulge\nand clump regions (symbols as before). Both the clump and interclump surface densities\nincrease with redshift as (1 + z)4 , which is the blue curve, because of a detection limit: we\ncan only measure detectable surface densities (cf. Fig. 6 and Sect. 3.1) and these tend to\nbe a constant value above the sky noise.\nThe average vertical deviations between the points in Figure 10 and the log(1 + z)4\ncurves are a measure of the relative surface densities for the four galaxy types. This quantity\n\u0001\nmay be written as h log [\u03a3clump \u2212 \u03a3interclump ] / [1 + z]4 i. For non-bulge clumps in spirals,\nflocculents, clump clusters with red disks, and clump clusters, the average values of this\nquantity are 0.7 \u00b1 0.4, 0.4 \u00b1 0.4, 0.6 \u00b1 0.4, and 0.7 \u00b1 0.4. For the bulges, it is 1.7 \u00b1 0.4,\n1.1 \u00b1 0.5, 0.6 \u00b1 0.6, and 0.7 \u00b1 0.4, respectively. Again we see that the excess surface densities\nare higher for bulges than clumps, and they are higher yet for the spiral bulges and flocculent\nbulges (average factor of 7) than for the clump cluster bulges (average factor of 1). This\nlatter result implies that if clump clusters evolve into spirals, then the bulges in clump\nclusters have to get denser with time (by an average factor of 6, which is 10 to the power\n0.5 [1.7 + 1.1 \u2212 0.6 \u2212 0.7]).\n\u0001\nSimilarly for the interclump regions, the averages of log [\u03a3interclump ] / (1 + z)4 for the\nfour galaxy types are 0.9 \u00b1 0.5, 0.7 \u00b1 0.5, 0.8 \u00b1 0.7, and 0.3 \u00b1 0.6, respectively. Evidently,\nthe interclump surface density is a factor of \u223c 3 higher for spirals, flocculents, and clump\nclusters with red disks than for clump clusters without red disks. This excess is consistent\nwith the conversion of clump cluster galaxies into spiral galaxies as some fraction of the\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nclump mass disperses into the interclump medium.\nFigure 11 shows the results again for the GOODS clump clusters, but now including\nseveral higher redshift UDF galaxies of the same morphological type. The UDF galaxies\nare from Elmegreen & Elmegreen (2005), with photometric redshifts from Elmegreen et al.\n(2007a) and analyzed in the same way as the GOODS galaxies. The minimum detectable\nsurface density continues to increase as (1 + z)4 because of the brightness detection limit.\nFor the interclump regions, the UDF points are slightly below the curve while the GOODS\npoints are slightly above, reflecting the longer exposure time for the UDF.\nThe increase of intrinsic surface density with redshift is opposite to the trend expected.\nSurface density should decrease with increasing redshift as younger versions of galaxies are\nobserved. Observations of higher surface densities imply that we are seeing only the brightest\nparts of the disks. At higher redshifts, these parts should come more and more from the inner\nregions of the galaxies. Thus the trend of increasing surface density should correspond to a\ntrend of decreasing observable galaxy size. Many studies have shown that galaxies appear to\nbe physically smaller at z > 1 because we are observing primarily the brighter inner regions\nof their disks (e.g., Buitrago et al. 2008; Azzollini, et al. 2009 and references therein).\nFigure 12 shows histograms of the ratio of the clump star formation surface density\nto the interclump surface density. Each count in the histogram is one clump. There is a\nwide range in ratios, but generally the clump clusters have higher ratios than the spirals\nand flocculents. For clump clusters, the typical star formation region has a mass surface\ndensity that is a factor of \u223c 2 larger than the interclump surface density. This is considered\nto be a lower limit to the true clump contrast for two reasons: (1) the measured interclump\nsurface density is always just above the sky noise (cf. Fig. 6) and therefore higher than\nthe minimum interclump surface density in the disk, which is probably unobservable; and\n(2) the clumps are barely resolved and probably contain substructure or peaks with higher\nsurface densities. For spirals and flocculents, the clump/interclump contrast is \u223c 0.3 with\na wide range. Clump-cluster bulges have about the same surface density contrast as the\nclumps, which is consistent with their having comparable masses, shown above. Spiral and\nflocculent bulges have much higher contrasts than the clumps, by factors of \u223c 3 to \u223c 30.\nA contrast of \u223c 2 between the surface density of the star formation part of a clump and\nthe surface density of the nearby interclump region implies that the total clump/interclump\nsurface density contrast, which means the star formation plus the background in the clump,\ncompared to the background alone, is a factor of 2+1 = 3. Evidently, the star-forming clumps\nare significant gravitational perturbations in the disks of clump clusters. This contrast is\nmuch larger than in local galaxies. In the Milky Way, the average mass column density of a\nmolecular cloud is \u223c 170 M\u2299 pc\u22122 (Solomon et al 1987), which is comparable to the stellar\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nmass column density in the inner regions of the disk. The star formation efficiency in such\na cloud is only a few percent, so the surface density of an OB association or star complex is\nonly a few percent of the background. As a result, it takes \u223c 100 events of star formation\nin local molecular clouds to significantly increase the surface density of a local stellar disk.\nHowever, in clump clusters, a single event of star formation will significantly increase the disk\nstellar surface density. For the clumps to be so dense, the associated gas column density in\nthe disk must be comparable to or larger than the stellar surface density. Such high gas mass\nfractions were also derived from the conditions required to make the clumps by gravitational\ninstabilities in the disk (BEE).\n\n3.2.3. Clump Ages\nFigure 13 shows the ages in Gyr of the excess emission from each clump (blue cross)\nand bulge (red square) versus redshift in the left-hand panels, and the ages of the associated\ninterclump regions in the right-hand panels. The scatter in age is larger than the uncertainty\nin each fit, which is a factor of \u223c 4 (Sect. 3.1). This scatter is a result of continuous star\nformation in these disks, so some regions are intrinsically younger than others.\nBulge ages are significantly older than clump ages for spirals and flocculents, but about\nthe same as clump ages for clump clusters. This is consistent with our findings in EEFL.\nThere is a slight trend toward decreasing clump age with increasing redshift. We found this\ntrend in the UDF also (EEFL). In that previous paper, where the galaxies spanned a wide\nrange in redshifts, the age trend paralleled the age of the local universe and so was partly\na result of a real physical effect, namely, that clumps and bulges in a young universe have\nto be young themselves. In the present study, with a smaller redshift range, this effect is\nexpected to be smaller. There could also be some selection effect involved because higher\nredshifts highlight bluer regions in the disk, and bluer regions are younger.\nFigure 14 shows histograms of the logarithm of the ratio of the age of the excess emission\nfrom each clump (indicated by the subscript \"clump-interclump\") to the age of the associated\ninterclump region. The histograms scatter around a ratio of \u223c 1 (log \u223c 0) for clump clusters\nwith no red underlying disks (bottom of the figure), and \u223c 0.3 (log \u223c \u22120.5) for clump\nclusters with underlying red disks, spirals, and flocculents.\nThe age and surface brightness trends suggest an evolution from clump clusters without\nred underlying disks to clump clusters with red underlying disks, presumably as the clumps\ndissolve, age, and mix into the disks. The trend continues to the spirals and flocculents.\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\n3.2.4. Clump Star Formation Rates\nFigure 15 shows average clump star formation rates determined from the ratio of each\nclump mass (above the background) to its age (in M\u2299 yr\u22121 ). The rates increase sharply with\nredshift because of a combination of two selection effects: clump masses increase with the\ngalaxy detection limits, and clump ages decrease because of an increasing bias toward the\nyoungest components of a clump at decreasing rest wavelength. The increase in clump mass\nwith redshift is probably from a combination of effects: increased clump blending as the\nphysical resolution gets worse, an increased Jeans length as the turbulent speed increases,\nan increase in absolute clump surface brightness at the detection threshold, and an increase\nin average galaxy luminosity with increasing cosmological volume. While blending must\nbe important for some considerations, blending does not drive the increasing clump mass\nbeyond z \u223c 1.6 (e.g., EEFL) because the physical resolution begins to improve. Also for\nz < 1, blending does not cause the distinction between clump clusters and spiral galaxies\nbecause both occur at the same redshift (Figs. 2-5).\nGenerally the clumps we measure are well separated so they are resolved from each\nother. They also have a high contrast to the interclump medium so we are not selecting\nmarginally resolved local peaks in a slowly varying background. The fact that the ratio\nof the clump mass to the total galaxy light is independent of redshift indicates that we\nare not progressively smoothing over bigger and bigger subregions within a galaxy as the\nspatial resolution worsens. More likely, most of the clumps are identified correctly as discrete\nobjects, and their masses are measured correctly without severe blending effects, but the\nwhole galaxies are suffering a selection problem related to angular resolution and surface\nbrightness limitations. That is, we choose to examine only galaxies that we resolve spatially\n(we limit our survey to galaxies larger than 10 pixels in diameter) and that we see above the\nsky noise surface brightness limit. These galaxy luminosities increase with redshift by this\nselection effect (see Fig. 9 in EEFL), but for each galaxy, the large clumps are distinct and\nthe clump masses are not themselves suffering an additional selection effect.\nFits to the redshift dependence of the star formation rate as \u221d (1 + z)\u03b1 are shown\nin Figure 15, with blue curves for the clumps and red curves for the bulges or bulge-like\nclumps. The average of all of the slopes \u03b1 gives SF R \u221d (1 + z)8 . This sharp increase with\nredshift is the result of an increase in clump mass and a decrease in clump age, both of\nwhich vary by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude over the redshift range from 0 to 1. The relation\nmakes sense if we consider that the clump mass scales with the galaxy luminosity (Fig.\n8) and the galaxy luminosity scales with the limiting surface brightness multiplied by the\nlimiting resolved physical area, which is approximately a scaling of \u221d (1 + z)4 \u00d7 z 2 for small\nredshifts. The clump age should scale with the characteristic age of a star at the central\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nrestframe wavelength for the ACS. Stellar ages scale with their surface temperatures T as\nage \u221d T \u22124 \u221d (1 + z)\u22124 . Thus the ratio of clump mass to age should scale with \u223c z 2 (1 + z)8\nif the observations are dominated by selection effects. This is close to what we see, which\nmeans that the individual clump masses, ages, and formation rates are not characteristic\nof all star formation in these galaxies (i.e., there are smaller and older clumps that are not\nmeasured).\nThe right-hand side of Figure 15 shows the product of the clump age and the clump\ndynamical rate, (G\u03c1)1/2 , where density \u03c1 comes from 3M/(4\u03c0R3 ) for clump mass M and\nradius R = (M/\u03c0\u03a3clump\u2212interclump )1/2 . This product is approximately constant, or perhaps\ndecreases slowly with redshift, within the observed redshift range. According to the analysis\nin the previous paragraph, it should decrease approximately as (1 + z)\u22122 z \u22121/2 . The point-topoint scatter is much larger than this factor. Thus, selection effects are much smaller for this\ndimensionless ratio than for the star formation rate itself. The average clump age is about 1\ndynamical time, with a scatter of a factor of \u223c 10 either way. Bulges are significantly older\nthan clumps in units of their dynamical time. This implies that star formation in bulges has\nslowed down or stopped, and it also implies that bulges are gravitationally bound.\nThe average value of unity for the product of age and dynamical rate is reasonable\nconsidering that local star formation has about this same value (Elmegreen 2007). However,\nanother selection effect could be present: fainter star-forming regions observed with the same\nphysical resolution limit would have lower densities and longer dynamical times. If they are\nolder, then they are redder and even fainter in restframe blue passbands. Thus we tend to\nsee the densest and youngest regions at blue restframes. The youngest that any physically\nmeaningful star-forming region can be for its density is the dynamical age, because this is\nhow long it takes star formation to begin. Thus the value of unity is selected in any survey\nof the most easily observed star-forming regions.\nFigure 16 shows the average clump star formation rate again for the clump clusters, but\nnow with the UDF values added to extend the redshift range. The product of the age and\nthe dynamical rate is on the right. The UDF points extend the trend seen in the previous\nfigure, considering that the spatial resolution scale stops increasing and levels off at z \u223c 1.6.\n\n4.\n\nDisk Thickness\n\nThe intrinsic thicknesses of edge-on disk galaxies in the GEMS and GOODS surveys\nwere measured by fitting perpendicular profiles made with the IRAF routine pvector to\nGaussian-blurred sech2 (z/z0 ) functions (see Elmegreen & Elmegreen 2006). The Gaussian\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nblur accounts for the point spread function of the ACS. Measurements of this function for\nten stars in GOODS gave FWHM dispersions of 3.21 px, 3.08 px, 2.87 px, and 3.18 px in\nB435 , V606 , i775 , and z850 filters, respectively. (Note a typographical error in Elmegreen &\nElmegreen [2006] where we quote a Gaussian sigma for the ACS stellar images of about 3\npx but actually mean and use a FWHM equal to this value.) At redshifts of 0.1, 0.3, and 1,\na FWHM of 3 pixels corresponds to a projected distance of 160, 400, and 720 pc. At higher\nredshift in the UDF, the projected distance gets slightly smaller; e.g., it is 640 pc at z = 4.\nFor chain galaxies, the perpendicular profiles were taken to be as wide in the parallel-to-disk\ndirection as the major axes, to minimize the pixel noise. For edge-on spirals (distinguished\nby their bulges in the ACS images), two wide profiles were taken, one on each side of the\nbulge, and then averaged. All ACS passbands were measured and fit, but here we discuss\nonly the fit to the observed V606 -band image. There is a slight increase in disk thickness with\nwavelength (see Elmegreen & Elmegreen 2006).\nThe top right panel of Figure 17 shows the resultant thicknesses z0 versus the absolute\nrestframe B-band magnitudes, from COMBO17 (Wolf et al. 2008). Each symbol represents\na GEMS or GOODS edge-on galaxy. Spirals (plus symbols) and chains (dots) have about\nthe same thicknesses (as in the UDF; Elmegreen & Elmegreen 2006). The other panels in\nFigure 17 show: local galaxies in the top left, UDF chains in the lower left, and UDF spirals\nin the lower right. Each panel has a solid line showing the indicated linear fit to the points\nin that panel, and three dashed lines showing the linear fits to the points in the other panels\n(color coded), for comparison. The UDF results are from our previous paper; the dots with\ncircles represent the best cases for measurement (the linear fits include all galaxies plotted).\nThe local scale heights were determined from a sech2 fit to R-band images; plus symbols are\nfrom Yoachim & Dalcanton (2006), x\u2212symbols are from Barteldrees & Dettmar (1994), and\nopen circles are from Bizyaev & Kajsin (2004).\nThe left-hand panel of Figure 18 shows the scale height z0 versus redshift for GEMS and\nGOODS spirals (plus symbols) and chain galaxies (dots) and UDF chain galaxies (crosses).\nThe two groups have similar dependencies. There is a decrease in z0 for low redshift, as there\nwas a decrease in clump mass for low redshift in Figure 8. Both decreases arise because the\ngalaxies in these surveys are intrinsically fainter at lower redshifts. The green curve shows the\nFWHM of point sources in the GOODS images, taken to be a constant 3.0 px. The lower\nenvelope of the point distribution is about the FWHM, so the thinnest disks are barely\nresolved. The right-hand panel of Figure 18 shows the difference between the measured scale\nheight and the scale height at the restframe MB of the galaxy that comes from the linear fit\nin Figure 17. This MB \u2212corrected scale height has no redshift dependence and is the same\nfor GEMS, GOODS, and UDF chains.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nAccording to the linear fits in Figure 17, the scale height of an MB = \u221220.3 mag galaxy\nis \u223c 1.2 kpc locally, \u223c 1.2 kpc in GEMS and GOODS, \u223c 0.86 kpc for UDF chains, and\n\u223c 1.0 kpc for UDF spirals, with \u223c 30% variations around these values. These scale heights\nare all about the same at this absolute magnitude. Galaxies tend to be thinner at fainter\nmagnitudes, and local faint galaxies appear thinner than high redshift faint galaxies by about\n30%. This difference is too small to be significant considering the relatively poor angular\nresolution of the high redshift disks.\nFigures 17 and 18 suggest that clumpy galaxies and spiral galaxies in GEMS and\nGOODS have about the same thickness when viewed edge-on. This is also about the same\nas the thickness of galaxies in the local universe when scaled to the same absolute restframe\nblue magnitude. High redshift galaxies should fade over time, however, and the thickness\nof the parts currently observed at high redshift could change as well, with disk accretion\nincreasing the gravitational force and causing a shrinkage, and satellite accretion or stellar\nscattering off clouds and spiral waves stirring the disk and causing an expansion.\nTo estimate fading over time, we use the population evolution models in Bruzual &\nCharlot (2003) for a Chabrier IMF and a metallicity of 0.4 solar (as elsewhere in this paper).\nIn one of their tables, the absolute B-band magnitude per unit solar mass of stars varies with\nage T in Gyrs approximately as MB = 4.88 + 2.37 log(T ) mag. Then a change in T from 1\nGyr to 5 Gyr corresponds to an increase in MB by 1.66 mag; a change in T from 3 Gyr to 10\nGyr increases MB by 1.24 mag. If we consider these values to be typical and take 1.5 mag of\nfading for this population in the restframe B band, and if we combine this fading magnitude\nwith the fitted relation in Figure 17, log z0 = \u22121.312 \u2212 0.067MB , then the thickness ends up\ntoo large for its faded magnitude by 0.067 \u00d7 1.5 = 0.10 in the log, or a factor of 1.26 in z0 .\nThis argument suggests a way in which old components of today's disks, viewed directly in\nGEMS and GOODS, can end up thicker than the young components by the time they are\nviewed in a modern galaxy. Satellite stirring and stellar scattering in the disk would do the\nsame thickening with age, but here we see the thicker components of the main disk before\nsubsequent kinematical evolution. We do not believe we are seeing what is called a thick-disk\ncomponent, however. That would be thicker than our observed values by a factor of 2 for a\ngiven MB , considering the thick disk measurements in Yoachim & Dalcanton (2006).\nTo check disk thickness in another way, we measured the major and minor axes lengths\nfrom IRAF pvector scans in the V606 band for 46 chain galaxies and clumpy edge-on spirals in\nGOODS that had reliable redshifts in Wolf et al. (2008). The perpendicular scans used for\nthis were the same wide scans used to determine z0 ; these scans are as wide as the galaxies\nare long. For the spirals, there are two scans, one on each side of the bulge, and the average\nof the two widths was used. The parallel scans are as wide as the galaxies are thick. The\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\naxes endpoints were determined at intensities equal to half of the local peak. For a minor\naxis, this was generally half of the total peak, but for a major axis, this was half of the peak\nintensity of the part at each end, even if there was a brighter part in the center. The point\nof this procedure is that it allows us to subtract the FWHM of a stellar image from the\nmeasured axis length in quadrature, to correct for the instrument point spread function. We\ntake a FWHM of 3.08 px from Gaussian fits to stars in the V606 band. The average minor\naxis width after correction for the point spread function is 8.1 \u00b1 2.3 px, which is enough\nlarger than the FWHM of a star for us to be confident that we have resolved this length.\nThe average ratio of minor to major axis is 0.16 \u00b1 0.06. The range of ratios is 0.06 to 0.33.\nThere was no significant difference between the chains and the spirals in these ratios. This\nvalue of 0.16 is somewhat large compared to local edge-on, late-type spiral galaxies, where\na typical minimum ratio for edge-on cases is \u223c 0.1 (from the de Vaucouleurs et al. 1991\natlas; see Figure 9 in Elmegreen et al. 2005). It is larger still compared to the flattest local\ngalaxies (Karachentsev et al. 2000). The difference between the GOODS and local galaxies\nis not considered to be significant, however, given the poor resolution in GOODS and the\nunknown inclinations of clumpy systems.\nThe observed axial ratios for the outer isophotes of these edge-on galaxies are larger\nwithout the correction for instrument point spread function. At the level of 2\u03c3 sky noise,\nthe average axial ratio for the same galaxies is 0.270 \u00b1 0.078.\nIn another test of disk thickness, we measured the radial exponential scale lengths, hR , of\nmost of the edge-on spirals in GEMS and GOODS that are larger than 10 pixels, which is 113\ngalaxies. This was done in all ACS passbands, but we discuss the V606 measurements here.\nThese lengths were determined from thick parallel scans using pvector as above, and fit to a\nGaussian-blurred model of an exponential disk viewed edge on. The Gaussian blur corrected\nfor the point spread function, taken to be 3.08 px from stellar images. The halfwidths z0\nwere also determined for these spiral galaxies by fitting to a Gaussian-blurred sech2 (z/z0 )\nfunction, as above. Then we determined the ratio of the scale height to the scale length,\nz0 /hR . The average value was 0.43 \u00b1 0.20. Comparing this to the ratio for local galaxies in\nFigure 5 of Yoachim & Dalcanton (2006), we see that the ratio in GOODS is larger than\nthe ratio for local spirals by a factor of 2 to 3. It is larger even than the ratio for local\ngalaxies with low circular velocities (dwarf Irregulars), which has the largest ratio among\nlocal types, equal to \u223c 0.2 on average. This result does not mean that the GOODS galaxies\nare particularly thick, however, as there should be extinction corrections from dust in the\nmidplane. The average ratio is therefore viewed to be unreliable.\nThe above three paragraphs suggest that the disks in GEMS and GOODS could be\nslightly thicker for their magnitudes or lengths than the disks in local spirals. We are highly\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nconstrained by the available resolution of the ACS, however. We find, for example, that the\nphysical lengths of both the minor and major axes (in kpc) increase with redshift (as on the\nleft in Figure 18). Presumably the thinnest disks at high redshift are too faint to include in\nour survey.\nThe scale height from Figure 18 and the mass column density of the interclump medium\nfrom Figure 10 can be combined to give a velocity dispersion, \u03c3. Using the thin disk formula,\n1/2\n\u03c3 2 = \u03c0G\u03a3total z0 , we get \u03c3 = 20 (\u03a3total /30 M\u2299 pc\u22122 ) (z0 /kpc)1/2 km s\u22121 . This normalization value of \u03a3total = 30 M\u2299 pc\u22122 is comparable to the stellar value \u03a3interclump in Figure\n10. If there is a significant amount of gas, then the total column density would be larger,\npossibly making \u03c3 \u223c 30 km s\u22121 or more. This is comparable to the velocity dispersion of\nstars in the solar neighborhood.\n\n5.\n\nA Comparison between GOODS Galaxies, a Local Flocculent Galaxy, and a\nLocal Dwarf Irregular Galaxy\n\nThe clumpy appearance of some galaxies in this study is reminiscent of that in local\nflocculent galaxies. Figure 19 shows a comparison between two GOODS galaxies and the\nlocal flocculent NGC 7793, blurred to the same spatial resolution and viewed at the same\nrestframe wavelength. The top left panel shows a IIIa-J (3950 \u00c5) image of NGC 7793\ntaken with the UK Schmidt telescope and obtained from the Digital Sky Survey at the\nSpace Telescope Science Institute (MAST). The top right panel shows the B435 image of the\nGOODS galaxy 34443, which has a redshift of z = 0.139 (Wolf et al. 2008). The restframe\nwavelength for this galaxy is 4350/1.139 = 3819\u00c5, close to the wavelength of the NGC 7793\nimage to its left.\nThe blurring of NGC 7793 was done as follows. For z = 0.139 in the GOODS galaxy,\none pixel in the ACS camera, which is 0.03\", corresponds to a projected spatial size of 72.6\npc. The average FWHM of stars in the ACS image at B435 band was measured to be 3.2\npixels, so the FWHM of point sources appears to have a size of 230 pc in the image of 34443.\nTo make a blurred image of NGC 7793 with the same physical scale for the FWHM of a point\nsource, we first note that the original image scale is 1.7\" per pixel, and the average FWHM\nof several stars in the field is 2.05 pixels. NGC 7793 is at a distance of 3.1 Mpc (NASA/IPAC\nExtragalactic Database), and at this distance, the desired FWHM resolution scale of 230\npc subtends 15.5,\" which is 9.1 px. Thus we blur the original image of NGC 7793 with\nthe routine Gauss in IRAF using a Gaussian convolution function with a Gaussian sigma\nthat produces a net FWHM of 9.1 px. Considering that the original image has a FWHM of\n1/2\n2.05 px, this means we have to blur it with an additional FWHM of (9.12 \u2212 2.052) = 8.87\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\npixels. The corresponding Gaussian sigma for the blur is 8.87/ (8 ln 2) = 3.77 pixels.\nThe image of NGC 7793 is further degraded to make the pixel scale and the noise level\nabout the same as for 34443. As mentioned above, the number of pixels in a resolution\nFWHM for the blurred image of NGC 7793 is 9.1 px, and the number in 34443 is 3.2 px.\nThe ratio of these is 2.8, so we re-pixelate the blurred NGC 7793 image by converting each\nblock of 3 \u00d7 3 pixels into a single pixel using the blkavg routine in IRAF. Also, the ratio of\nthe number of counts in the peaks of 34443 to the rms of the sky was measured to be about\n10, so we subtracted sky from the blurred re-pixelated image of NGC 7793 and added noise\nusing the IRAF routine mknoise, giving it the same ratio of peak intensity to sky rms. The\nresult of all of these steps is an image of the local flocculent galaxy NGC 7793 that has the\nsame rest wavelength, physical resolution, pixelation, and noise level as the GOODS galaxy\n34443. Figure 19 shows the two images with about the same linear and angular scales.\nThe bottom two panels in Figure 19 make a similar comparison between NGC 7793 and\nthe GOODS galaxy COMBO17 17969 at z = 1.08. In this case, the image on the left is the\nNUV (2267 \u00c5) image of NGC 7793 from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer satellite (GALEX;\nMartin et al. 2005). It has an image scale of 1.5\" per pixel and a FWHM measured for\nseveral point sources of \u223c 3.38 px. The image on the right is the B435 image of 17969, which\nhas a restframe wavelength of 4350/2.08 = 2090\u00c5, close to that of the NGC 7793 image. At\nz = 1.08, one px in the ACS corresponds to 245 pc, so the FWHM of a point source in 17969\nhas a spatial scale of 790 pc. We want to blur the NGC 7793 image to the same physical\nscale. At a distance of 3.1 Mpc, 790 pc subtends an angle of 52.7,\" which is 35.1 px. The\nintrinsic FWHM of the GALEX image is 3.38 px, so we have to blur it with an additional\n1/2\n(35.12 \u2212 3.382)\n= 35.0 pixels FWHM. Converting this to a Gaussian, we get \u03c3 = 14.9\npx for the IRAF routine Gauss. Then the physical resolution of the NGC 7793 and 17969\nimages are the same (790 pc). Next we re-pixelate NGC 7793 using the routine blkavg with\na box size equal to the ratio of the FWHM of a point source in NGC 7793, 35.1 px, to the\nFWHM of a point source in 17969, 3.2 px; the closest integer to this ratio is 11. Finally we\nsubtract sky and add noise to the NGC 7793 image. The ratio of the intensity of a typical\npeak in 17969 to the rms of the sky is \u223c 20, so we add noise to the degraded image of NGC\n7793 to give this same ratio. The result is the image of NGC 7793 in the lower left of Figure\n19, with the same rest wavelength, physical resolution, pixelation, noise level, and scale as\nthe GOODS galaxy 17969.\nThe blurred images of NGC 7793 have blended star formation regions that are about\nthe same diameter as the star formation regions in the GOODS galaxies. NGC 7793 has a\nprominent exponential disk, however, so the central region looks like a big clump. This is\nnot the case for the clump clusters. Also, in the bottom left of Figure 19, the two biggest\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\nclumps in NGC 7793 look like projection-enhanced parts of the exponential disk because\nthey are on the minor axis. If such disks are also present in high redshift clumpy galaxies,\nthen they have to be much fainter relative to the clumps than in local galaxies in order to\nhave the high clump/interclump contrast shown in Figures 12 and 19. For GOODS galaxy\nCOMBO17 17969 in the bottom right of Figure 19, the clumps stand out sharply from the\nrest of the disk in the restframe UV, much more than the clumps in NGC 7793 at the same\nNUV wavelength. Thus a primary difference between the GOODS clump clusters and a local\nflocculent galaxy is the high surface density contrast of the clumps in the GOODS sample.\nWe made the same point in Section 3.2.2. Other differences are the small number and high\nmass of distinct clumps in the GOODS galaxies compared with local spirals.\nFigure 20 shows a comparison between a GOODS clump cluster and a local dwarf\nIrregular, Ho II, at a distance of 3.48 Mpc (NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database). On the\nleft is the NUV image (2267 \u00c5) of Ho II at full resolution, which is 1.5\" per pixel with a\nFWHM of 3.4 px for a point source. In the center is Ho II blurred with a Gaussian \u03c3 = 13.1\npx so that the FWHM of a point source has a size of 780 pc. On the right is the V606 ACS\nimage of COMBO17 18561, which has a photometric redshift of 1.367 (Wolf et al. 2008). The\nrest wavelength is 6060/2.367 = 2560\u00c5, about the same as in the Ho II image. The FWHM\nof a point source is 3.08 px, with a 0.03\" pixel. At its redshift, this FWHM corresponds to\n780 pc, the same FWHM as for Ho II. Thus the GOODS image of 18561 on the right has\nthe same resolution and restframe wavelength as the blurred NUV image of Ho II in the\ncenter. The two also have about the same pixel scale, relative noise level, and page scale,\nas discussed for Figure 19. Evidently the degraded local dwarf Irregular in Figure 20 looks\nqualitatively similar to a clump cluster, unlike the flocculent spiral in Figure 19.\nQuantitatively, Ho II and COMBO17 18561 are very different, however. The apparent\nB magnitude of Ho II is 11.13 (Bureau & Carignan 2002) and the distance is 3.48 Mpc, so\nthe absolute B magnitude is \u221216.6. According to Wolf et al. (2008), the restframe absolute\nB magnitude of 18561 is \u221220.37, a factor of \u223c 30 brighter. The prominent clump in the\nupper part of 18561 has an apparent z850 magnitude of 25.4 without background subtraction.\nThis passband corresponds to a restframe wavelength of 3600 \u00c5, similar to U-band. For the\nredshift of 1.367, the distance modulus is 44.96 so the absolute restframe U magnitude of\nthe clump is \u221219.6. The U-B color of Ho II is -0.1 (Stewart et al. 2000) so the U-band\nmagnitude of Ho II is \u221216.7. Thus the prominent clump in 18561 is 2.9 magnitudes, or a\nfactor of 14, brighter than all of Ho II in the restframe U band. The mass we derive for the\nstar-forming part of this clump is 1.3 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 and the age we get is \u223c 3 Myr. This is the\nsame age as the central clump in Ho II, which contains \u223c 170 O stars and is \u223c 100 pc across\n(Stewart et al. 2000).\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\nThere have been several studies of local galaxies blurred, dimmed, and bandshifted to\nsee what high redshift galaxies might look like (e.g., Brinchmann et al 1998; Burgarella et\nal. 2001; Smith et al. 2001; Papovich et al. 2003; Taylor-Mager et al. 2007). Burgarella\net al. found that the largest change in morphology comes from viewing a galaxy in the\nrestframe UV, which makes a galaxy more asymmetric and less centrally concentrated than\nin a visible band image. In their examples of redshifted local galaxies, however, the spiral\narms are usually still visible and the star-forming regions are only slightly higher contrast\nthan they are locally. They do not look like the clump clusters shown here in Figures 4 and\n5.\nOverzier et al. (2008) showed that local compact UV-luminous galaxies are similar to\nLyman Break galaxies when convolved to the same spatial resolution and viewed in the same\nrestframe. They suggested that the Lyman Break galaxies are collisional starbursts, like the\nlocal galaxies. It may be that some clump clusters are collisional starbursts too. COMBO17\n28751, 39638, 26313, 44885 and perhaps others in Figure 5, have extended features that could\nbe tidal in origin. However, if chain galaxies are the edge-on counterparts to clump clusters,\nthen these galaxies are generally too flat to be tidally distorted in a collision (Elmegreen &\nElmegreen 2006). We examined collisional galaxies in GOODS (Elmegreen et al. 2007b) and\nat these modest redshifts, they still look like local collisions. Also, the clump cluster UDF\n6462 has extended features like some clump clusters in Figure 5, but it has a continuous\nrotation curve and a metallicity gradient, suggesting it is a single clumpy disk (Bournaud et\nal. 2008).\n\n6.\n6.1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nGiant Clumps: Bandshifting, Selection Effects, and Origins\n\nThe GOODS field offers a view of young galaxy morphology at redshifts z < 1 with\nselection effects caused by bandshifting, variable spatial resolution, and variable surface\nbrightness dimming. The effects of bandshifting are not so bad at these redshifts, though.\nGOODS galaxies observed in the z850 ACS band are bandshifted only to their restframe V\nor B-band, where we know what local galaxies look like. UDF bandshifting for z \u223c 2 \u2212 3\ngalaxies is much worse, as it takes a z850 image into the restframe UV, where even the\nlocal morphologies are uncertain and, in some cases, quite different than in the optical\nbands. Variable spatial resolution is more of a problem for GOODS than the UDF because\nthe spatial scale per pixel increases strongly with redshift at z < 1.6; the increase slows\nand reverses beyond that. Surface brightness dimming is a problem in both near and far\nredshift surveys, limiting what can be seen to the brightest resolved features and producing a\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\nstrong correlation between measured surface brightness and redshift. Here we discuss several\nproperties of young disk galaxies that are relatively insensitive to these three selection effects.\nFirst of all, the two new morphologies found at z \u223c 2 in the UDF, i.e., chain galaxies and\nclump clusters, are still present in GOODS in the redshift range from 0 to 1, alongside normallooking spirals. This demonstrates that bandshifting alone does not cause the appearance\nof clumpy structure. Clumpy galaxies still have no spirals or regular exponential disks in\nGOODS, and about half still have no bulges. The clump/interclump contrast in total mass\nsurface density is large for these galaxies, e.g., \u223c 2 \u2212 5, even in the restframe B-band. It\nis significantly smaller, \u223c 1.1 \u2212 2, for spirals and flocculent galaxies at the same redshift in\nGOODS. Bulges are more massive than star-forming clumps in spirals by a factor of \u223c 16 and\nolder by a factor of \u223c 10, whereas bulges are more massive than clumps in clump clusters by\na factor of only 2.2 and they are not significantly older. Spirals and flocculents have higher\ninterclump mass surface densities than clump clusters too, by a factor of \u223c 3 at the same\nredshift. All of these results suggest that clumpy galaxies are younger versions of spiral and\nflocculent galaxies, and that this youthful appearance extends even to objects observed at\nrecent cosmological times (z < 0.2).\nThe redshift dependencies of surface brightness, physical resolution, and restframe wavelength all contribute to a strong redshift dependence for the choice of galaxy in this survey,\nand ultimately, to the derived average star formation rate in a clump, given that clump\nmass scales with galaxy luminosity. This rate therefore has little utility in understanding\nthe star formation process. However, our result that the age of a clump is comparable to\nits dynamical time, as determined by the average clump density, is relatively insensitive to\nthese selection effects. This result confirms our assumption that the clumps are star-forming\nregions and it suggests that star formation is a dynamical process involving disk self-gravity,\nas it is locally.\nThe similarity between the star formation age and the dynamical time also makes a\nstrong statement about the origin of the clumps: they are not separate galaxies brought\nin from outside and settling into a common disk. If they were, then their backgroundsubtracted ages would be significantly larger than their dynamical times, i.e., they would be\nolder, self-bound, and more independent of each other.\nThe suggested origin of disk clumps by gravitational instabilities is analogous to the process commonly thought to trigger large-scale star formation in local galaxies (e.g., Elmegreen\n2002). If we take the analogy to local galaxies further, then we can compare the largest scales\nof star formation in the two cases. For local galaxies, the largest scale of coherent star formation is about the disk Jeans length, LJ = \u03c3 2 / (\u03c0G\u03a3), for velocity dispersion \u03c3 and mass\ncolumn density \u03a3 (which includes stars if the stellar and gaseous dispersions are compa-\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\nrable). The mass on this scale is about the Jeans mass, MJ = \u03c3 4 / (G2 \u03a3). That this is a\ncharacteristic scale for star formation and not a preferentially sampled scale has been shown\nby power spectra of optical galaxy images (Elmegreen et al. 2003a,b), fractal structure analysis of optical and HII region images (Elmegreen et al. 2006), and autocorrelation analysis\nof cluster positions (Zhang et al. 2001). In these studies, the structure involved with star\nformation itself is scale free, i.e., it has a power law power spectrum, but that power law only\nextends up to a scale of about 1 kpc, which is the characteristic or outer scale. Beyond that,\nstar-forming regions appear somewhat independent and uncorrelated. We also note that for\nstar formation on a dynamical time, the largest region that has a clump-like shape rather\nthan a spiral shape, distorted by shear, is this same Jeans length (Elmegreen & Efremov\n1996). This is because the dynamical time is less than the shear time on scales smaller than\nLJ in a marginally stable disk. Thus, whether a star-forming clump is the result of interstellar condensation from a gravitational instability or the result of widespread turbulence\ncompression in a shearing environment, there is an outer scale comparable to LJ .\nIn the context of high redshift galaxies, there is a selection effect where we only see\nstructures larger than the limiting spatial resolution. This structure would not generally\nhave a characteristic length representative of the star-formation process, and in fact we\ncannot measure such a length if the structure is unresolved. However, we have the fortunate\ncircumstance for young galaxies that the contrast between the bright features (clumps) and\nthe regions between the bright features (interclump stars) is very large, giving these galaxies\nthe appearance, even in optical restframes (Fig. 4 and 5), of extreme clumpiness. Then\nthe clump masses can be measured from their luminosities and colors even if the clumps\nare unresolved, without severe blending problems. To demonstrate this difference with local\ngalaxies, we compared in Figure 19 a local flocculent galaxy with two clumpy GOODS\ngalaxies, viewed with the same spatial resolution and restframe wavelength. In the local\ngalaxy, star formation patches on the scale of LJ are everywhere in an exponential disk, and\ntheir contrast is not particularly large. In the clumpy GOODS galaxy, however, there are\nonly a few very bright regions that are well separated from each other. In this sense, they\nare resolvable (from each other) and measurable in mass. After subtracting the light from\nthe surrounding disk, we found that the star-forming parts of these clumps have masses of\n107 to 108 M\u2299 in young stars, with a few clumps as massive as 109 M\u2299 . If there is gas in\nthese clumps as well as stars, then the masses would be larger, perhaps by a factor of 2 or\nmore. Because we identify this outer-scale mass with MJ , by analogy with local galaxies, we\nconclude that MJ is larger for star-forming clumps in the clumpiest high redshift galaxies\nthan it is in spiral galaxies locally. This case is more compelling for the GOODS clump\nclusters than the UDF clump clusters (EEFL) because bandshifting is not as severe for the\nGOODS galaxies, which means that the morphological contrast to spiral galaxies is more\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\nclear.\nThere is still a surface brightness limit in the GOODS and UDF clump clusters that\nlimits the clumps we can measure to only those with the highest surface densities. There\nshould be many more fainter and smaller young regions in clump cluster galaxies than we\ncan observe in these surveys. Thus we know little about typical star-forming regions or\nluminosity functions. Our conclusion is only that the maximum mass of a coherent unit\nof star formation increases with redshift. If we identify this mass with MJ , as proposed\nabove, then such a result would follow most sensitively from an increase in \u03c3, the velocity\ndispersion of the ambient neutral medium. We have made the same point for UDF galaxies\nbefore (EEFL) and noted how observations of random gas motions tend to support this\nhigher dispersion (F\u00f6rster-Schreiber et al. 2006; Weiner et al. 2006; Genzel et al. 2006,\n2008), although the dispersion in the ambient neutral medium has not yet been measured\nwith high angular resolution.\n\n6.2.\n\nOn Clump Migration to make a Bulge\n\nWe are interested in whether the clumps we observe are so massive and dense compared\nto their surrounding disks that they interact with each other and the halo, losing angular\nmomentum and spiraling into the center (e.g., Noguchi 1999; Immeli et al. 2004a,b; BEE).\nTo study this, we estimate the ratio of clump mass to galaxy mass and compare this with\nthe ratio in simulations where the clumps do migrate to the center. In BEE, we found that\nthe total clump mass was \u223c 30% of the disk mass (gas+stars), and the simulations formed\n\u223c 6 giant clumps which moved to the center in \u223c 1 Gyr. Thus each clump was \u223c 5% of\nthe disk mass. For the GOODS galaxies, we use the right-hand side of Figure 8, which\nshows the ratio of the clump mass to a measure of the galaxy luminosity, 10\u22120.4Brest . To\nconvert this luminosity to mass, we again use the population evolution models in Bruzual\n& Charlot (2003) for a Chabrier IMF and a metallicity of 0.4 solar. Recall from Section\n4 that MB = 4.88 + 2.37 log(T ) mag per unit solar mass of stars with age T in Gyrs.\nThe residual stellar mass of this population varies with age as M = 0.60 \u00d7 10\u22120.078 log T M\u2299 .\nIf we write M = A10\u22120.4MB in analogy with the formulation in Figure 8, then we derive\nA = 50 \u00d7 100.87 log T M\u2299 . As a consistency check, note that this gives a galaxy luminous mass\nM = 2.7 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 for Brest = \u221220.3 mag and a mean population age of T = 5 Gyr. The\ntotal galaxy mass would be larger because of dark matter.\nIn Figure 8, Mc \u223c 10\u22120.1\u00b10.4 \u00d710\u22120.4Brest M\u2299 for clump masses Mc in clump clusters with\nno obvious underlying disk. The ratio of the clump mass to the galaxy mass is therefore\n10\u22120.1\u00b10.4 /A = 10\u22121.8\u00b10.4\u22120.87 log T for average galaxy population age T , in Gyr. For the\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\naverage clump studied here, this mass ratio (= 1.6%) is smaller than the ratio for the BEE\nsimulations (5%) by a factor of \u223c 3 for T = 1. Clumps that are more massive than average\nby one standard deviation have a clump-to-galaxy mass ratio of 4%, which is close to the\nsimulation ratio. Considering that the BEE simulations did not determine a mass limit\nfor accretion to the center but only had clump masses that automatically came from the\ndisk instability, the observed clumps in clump cluster galaxies could be massive enough to\nspiral in for some of the distance, maybe even to the center if they are also dense enough\nto withstand the higher tidal forces there. The clumps in the spiral and flocculent galaxies\nstudied here are considerably lower in mass than this value for clump clusters, by another\nfactor of 6, and are therefore not likely to spiral in significantly. The spiral clumps will\nprobably disperse where they are, as in modern spiral and flocculent galaxies.\n\n6.3.\n\nClump Clusters as Massive versions of Local Dwarf Irregulars\n\nThe comparisons in section 5 between two local galaxies without prominent spiral density waves and GOODS clump clusters, viewed at the same spatial resolution and rest wavelength, illustrate two key differences. First, for similar size galaxies (flocculents versus clump\nclusters), the GOODS galaxies have higher intrinsic clump/interclump brightness contrasts.\nSecond, for similar morphologies (dwarf Irregulars versus clump clusters), the GOODS galaxies are intrinsically brighter by a factor of 10 to 100.\nEvidently, some clump clusters resemble massive versions of local dwarf Irregulars. If\nthe star-forming regions in both result from gravitational instabilities, then the clumps have\nto be relatively large in each type. This is presumably because of a relatively high gas\nfraction and a relatively large Jeans length compared to the galaxy size. The Jeans length\nin a gas-rich system is LJ = \u03c3 2 /\u03c0G\u03a3 for turbulent speed \u03c3 and mass column density \u03a3. For\na disk-to-halo mass ratio fD , \u03c0G\u03a3 = V 2 / (R [1 + 1/fD ]) for rotation speed V and disk scale\nR. Thus LJ /R \u223c (\u03c3/V )2 for moderate to large fD . When LJ /R is large, \u03c3/V must be large,\nand there is a small number of relatively large star formation clumps in a galaxy.\nA large gravitational length should also be evident in the disk thickness, which is the\nsame as LJ = \u03c3 2 /\u03c0G\u03a3 for a single-component system, or \u223c \u03c3 2 /\u03c0G\u03a3total for the gas in a\ngas+star system with total \u03a3total inside the gas layer. For dwarf Irregulars, both the clump\nsize and the disk thickness are indeed large compared to the radial scale length (Binggeli &\nPopescu 1995; Sung et al. 1998). The thicknesses of clump clusters are difficult to determine\nbecause of selection and resolution effects, but they appear to be large compared to the\nradial sizes too (Sect. 4).\n\n\f\u2013 30 \u2013\nDwarf Irregulars have both a thick disk and a clumpy structure because of their large\nvalue of \u03c3/V , which results from a small rotation speed V < 100 km s\u22121 and a normal\ndispersion, \u03c3 \u223c 10 km s\u22121 . Clump clusters are apparently massive galaxies with about the\nsame ratio of LJ /R and \u03c3/V , but in this case, V is probably typical of M \u2217 galaxies, namely\nV \u223c 150 \u2212 200 km s\u22121 . This means that the gaseous velocity dispersion has to be high, > 20\nkm s\u22121 . This is not unrealistic considering observations of high velocity dispersions in the\nionized gas (Sect. 1) and other constraints mentioned in the previous two subsections.\nAnother similarity between clump clusters and dwarf Irregulars is that neither have\nprominent spiral arms. Locally, this characteristic results from a lack of strong tidal or\nother asymmetric forces and, in the case of dwarfs, from a large stellar velocity dispersion\ncompared to the rotation speed. The first of these points suggests that when there are no\ntidal arms the clump cluster morphology results from internal processes. This emphasizes\nagain a likely analogy to local dwarf Irregulars, rather than local mergers.\nCollisions are necessary in the local universe to make a superstarburst because collisions\nare the only way that a local galaxy can rapidly accrete a large amount of gas. The primary\ningredient for a superstarburst is rapid gas accretion \u2013 much faster than the gas consumption\nrate by star formation, which is only several percent of the galaxy-wide dynamical rate.\nInteractions can bring in gas to the inner disk of a galaxy through tidal torques and through\ndirect contact, perhaps doubling the gas mass surface density in one dynamical time. This\nis much faster than the burn-off rate from normal star formation. At high redshift, however,\ncosmological accretion through a cold flow might double the amount of gas in a dynamical\ntime without any other galaxy involved (Sect. 1). The resulting gas and starburst will\ngenerally have an irregular structure as the cold flow is not likely to be symmetric and the\nyoung disk is likely to be unstable. Thus it is possible that a high fraction of clump cluster\ngalaxies, and perhaps some clumpy Lyman Break galaxies too, have their morphology and\nlarge star formation rates because of a high gas accretion rate and a high gas turbulent\nspeed in an intrinsically dense disk, rather than because of a current merger. This makes\nthem high-density and high-mass analogs of local dwarf Irregulars, rather than high-redshift\nanalogs of ULIRGS.\nClumpy galaxies are observed in a young state, so they can have a high gas fraction and\nhigh state of turbulence. The rate of star formation is high in them because the density is\nhigh, unlike the situation in local dwarf Irregulars where the intrinsic density is low and the\nstar formation rate is low.\n\n\f\u2013 31 \u2013\n6.4.\n\nDisk Stability and Damped Lyman Alpha Limits on the Star Formation\nRate\n\nA high velocity dispersion normally stabilizes a disk but clump clusters also need a high\ngas column density to simultaneously match the sizes and the masses of the giant clumps\n(EEFL). Recall that the Jeans length scales with \u03c3 2 /\u03a3 and the Jeans mass scales with \u03c3 4 /\u03a3,\nso the mass per unit length scales with \u03c3 2 . Regions that are larger by a factor of \u223c 3 and\nmore massive by a factor of \u223c 100 require a dispersion that is larger by a factor of \u223c 5 and a\nmass column density that is larger by a factor of \u223c 10 (EEFL). They are unstable even with\nthe high dispersion. The required \u03a3 \u223c 100 M\u2299 pc\u22122 is comparable to the column density in\nthe inner parts of modern spirals, and suggests again that clump clusters are young, gas-rich\nversions of local galaxies.\nThe high dispersion suggests a solution to the problem raised by Wolfe & Chen (2006),\nthat damped Lyman alpha absorption (DLA) in quasars often indicates a column density\nof HI (N > 2 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 ) that is unstable in the local universe but has no associated star\nformation in the high redshift universe. Wolfe & Chen noted that the observed gas has to be\nat least 10 times less efficient at forming stars than local galaxies, according to the Kennicutt\n(1998) relation. The local star formation threshold is \u223c 5 M\u2299 pc\u22122 (\u223c 2.6 \u00d7 1020 H cm\u22122\nincluding He). Many DLA systems have higher column densities than this with no evident\nemission.\nWolfe & Chen suggested that the column density threshold could be high in DLA galaxies because at high redshift only the dense inner parts of galaxies are well formed, and these\nparts have high angular rotation rates (i.e., for a fixed galaxy density relative to the average density of the universe, the angular rotation rate scales approximately inversely with the\nUniverse's age). High angular rotation rates stabilize the gas through the epicyclic frequency\n\u03ba in the Toomre expression for the critical column density, \u03a3crit = \u03c3\u03ba/ (3.36G). In this interpretation, stability occurs essentially because the galaxies are small. Our observations of\nclump clusters in the UDF do not find a size that correlates well with redshift (Elmegreen et\nal. 2007a), but we agree in principle with the Wolfe & Chen suggestion that the most active\nparts of clump clusters probably correspond to the inner regions of today's disks, primarily\nbecause that is all we can observe at the surface brightness limit.\nWolfe & Chen also suggested that the molecular fraction could be low in DLA gas as a\nresult of low metallicities, thereby requiring higher \u03a3crit to get molecules and star formation.\nLocal dwarf irregulars have low metallicities and molecular fractions too, but \u03a3crit is lower\nfor them than it is for spirals (Hunter et al. 1998). Other stabilizing mechanisms such as\ndisk flaring or a lack of cold gas were ruled out by Wolfe & Chen.\n\n\f\u2013 32 \u2013\nThe present observations suggest an additional solution to this problem. Young galaxies\nseem to have higher turbulent speeds than modern galaxies by a factor of \u223c 5 or more, and\n\u03a3crit increases in direct proportion to this speed. When star formation occurs in the unstable\npart of a gas-rich, highly-turbulent disk, it should be fast, violent, and make massive star\ncomplexes. This is what we observe in clump clusters. For the same dispersion, regions with\nlower column densities should be more stable and relatively quiescent. This is apparently\nwhat Wolfe & Chen find. We suggested in Section 6.3 that the turbulent speed in the disks\nof young massive galaxies is \u223c 20 km s\u22121 or more. This makes them stable at column\ndensities that would be unstable in local spirals. Measurements of DLA line widths (Wolfe\n& Prochaska 1998) include cases with such high values, but the overall DLA profile could be\ncontaminated by disk rotation, making the turbulent speed uncertain.\nIf we consider star-forming instabilities in the context of clump cluster morphology, we\ncan use the analogy with local dwarfs to infer that \u03c3/V \u223c (LJ /R)1/2 for velocity dispersion\n\u03c3, rotation speed V , star formation scale LJ , and galaxy size R (Sect. 6.3). Then the critical\ncolumn density is \u03a3crit \u223c (LJ /R)1/2 (V 2 /R) /1.7G for \u03ba \u223c 2V /R in the case of solid body\nrotation (use \u03ba = 1.4V /R for a flat rotation curve). With equally clumpy morphologies,\n(LJ /R)1/2 should be the same for clump clusters and local dwarf irregulars, making \u03a3crit\nscale with the square of the rotation speed. It should therefore be much larger in turbulent,\nhigh-redshift galaxies of normal size than it is in local dwarfs. In a galaxy with less clumpy\nstructure, such as local spirals, \u03a3crit should be smaller for the same V because (LJ /R)1/2\nis small. Local dwarfs have the lowest \u03a3crit because their lower V offsets the increase in\n(LJ /R)1/2 .\n\n7.\n\nConclusions\n\nClumpy galaxies have been examined in GOODS and GEMS and their clump properties\nand disk thicknesses measured. We are interested in the transition between these irregular\ntypes and modern disk systems. Our results may be summarized as follows:\n1. Chains and clump clusters are present at photometric redshifts down to \u223c 0.1 or\nlower, along with spiral galaxies with the same magnitudes and redshifts. This observation\nindicates that the clumpy morphology is not the result of bandshifting. That is, chains\nand clump clusters are not normal spiral galaxies simply viewed in the extreme ultraviolet\nrestframe. There is a tendency for star formation to look more clumpy at shorter wavelengths,\nbut the clump cluster morphology is generally more extreme than that.\n2. The primary difference between clumpy galaxies and local spiral galaxies is the\n\n\f\u2013 33 \u2013\ncontrast in both intensity and mass surface density between the clumps and the interclump\nregions. The clump clusters studied here have contrasts in mass surface density between the\nyoung parts of the brightest clumps and the surrounding interclump regions that are factors\nof 1 to 4, which means that the total contrasts in mass surface density are factors of 2 to 5.\nSpiral and flocculent galaxies at the same redshifts as the clump clusters have much smaller\nclump contrasts, 0.1-1 for the young parts of the clumps, or 1.1-2 for the total.\n3. There appears to be an evolutionary sequence from clump clusters with no evident\nred underlying disks, to clump clusters with red underlying disks and in some cases bulges,\nto spiral galaxies with either flocculent or long-arm spiral structures. Along this sequence,\nthe clump/interclump surface density contrast decreases, and bulges appear with greater\ndistinction from the clumps in terms of mass, surface density, and age. There are no evident\nexternal processes or merger-like processes, tidal tails, etc., associated with this change in\nbulge and clump morphology, suggesting that bulges grow from internal disk processes. Such\nprocesses might include clump coalescence and loss of clump angular momentum, as driven\nby gravitational friction and asymmetrical forces (BEE).\n4. This evolutionary sequence is mixed in redshift for the GOODS sample, which means\nthat the morphologically youngest galaxies, the clump clusters with no evident interclump\nemission, have about the same redshift distribution as the morphologically oldest galaxies,\nthe spirals. This mixture implies that clump clusters are either intrinsically young, and\ntherefore form continuously from intergalactic gas over a wide range of redshifts, or clump\nclusters rejuvenate from faint unseen forms to the starbursting clumpy systems that we see,\npossibly following a major gas accretion event. Considering the resemblance between clump\nclusters and dwarf Irregulars discussed in this paper, the faint unseen forms could be massive\nanalogs of local, low surface brightness, dwarf Irregulars.\n5. There is evidence for tidal structures in some clumpy galaxies, but not in all. Generally, the clump cluster morphology is distinct from the morphology of interacting galaxies.\nMany other galaxies in GOODS and GEMS covering the same redshift range as clump clusters are clearly interacting, showing all the usual signs of interactions, such as tidal tails, tidal\ndebris, and rings (Elmegreen et al. 2007b). Thus clump clusters are not merger remnants\nwhose tidal debris has been suppressed by cosmological surface brightness dimming. They\nare either somewhat isolated, or they are interacting less frequently and less strongly than\nconventional mergers. This, along with certain morphological details in a clumpy galaxy's\nstructure, suggest that galaxy growth is dominated by smooth gaseous inflow and not the\nmerger of smaller galaxies (Bournaud & Elmegreen 2009). Recent numerical simulations of\ngalaxy formation in a cosmological context reinforce this interpretation (Sect. 1). Clumpy\nasymmetric structure in a high redshift galaxy does not necessarily imply a merger.\n\n\f\u2013 34 \u2013\n6. Clump clusters resemble local dwarf Irregulars in restframe morphology far better\nthan they resemble flocculent spirals and mergers. However, clump clusters have the luminosities and masses of normal spiral galaxies, which are 10 to 100 times larger than local\ndwarf Irregulars. Thus clump clusters represent a unique galaxy stage: they are as massive\nas normal spirals but as irregular as dwarfs. This unique property is probably connected\nwith their extreme youth. Although neutral gas in clump clusters is not widely observed yet,\nwe feel confident in predicting that these galaxies will be found to have high gas fractions,\nas do dwarf Irregulars, and high gas velocity dispersions relative to their rotation speeds,\nas do dwarf Irregulars. The velocity dispersions of the ionized gas components are already\nobserved to be high (Sect. 1).\n7. Local dwarf Irregulars are not a perfect analog to high redshift clumpy galaxies. The\ndwarfs have low star formation rates and evolve slowly, whereas the high redshift systems\nare massive, star-bursting, and in extreme cases, evolve quickly to symmetric galaxies with\nbulges and exponential disks (BEE). The slow evolution for local dwarfs follows in part from\ntheir low disk surface density, and this helps explain why they still have high gas fractions\nafter a Hubble time. The difference between the two cases seems to be partly a matter of\nscale \u2013 not an indication of different physical processes. Scaling issues have selection effects\nthat depend the epoch of the system and the sensitivity of the observations. At early times,\nmassive disk galaxies take the form of clump clusters and can be as unevolved as today's\ndwarf Irregulars. Lower mass galaxies at these early times would not be observable. At late\ntimes, the massive clumpy disks have evolved into smooth disks, and the low mass versions,\nthe dwarf Irregulars, are the only visible remnants of this phase.\n8. The masses of star-forming regions relative to the surrounding galaxy appear to\nbe larger by a factor of \u223c 6 in clump clusters than in spirals at the same redshift (Sect.\n3.2.1). The clump masses also increase with redshift, although selection and resolution\neffects could contribute somewhat to this mass increase. More likely, the increase in relative\nclump mass parallels the observed increase in relative clump separation that defines the\nclumpy morphology (i.e., compared to the galaxy radius), and both are the result of an\nincrease in gas turbulent speed relative to the galaxy rotation speed. The turbulent speed of\nthe neutral gas component in high redshift galaxies is not yet observed, but it is predicted\nto be high, 20 \u2212 50 km s\u22121 .\n9. A high gas velocity dispersion relatively to the rotation speed increases the threshold\ncolumn density for gravitational instabilities. This can explain the observed lack of star\nformation in gas that produces damped Lyman alpha absorption. A comparable ratio of\ndispersion to rotation speed in local dwarf Irregulars and in high redshift clump clusters, as\nsuggested by their similar morphologies, also explains the low threshold column density for\n\n\f\u2013 35 \u2013\nstar formation in local dwarfs.\nWe are grateful to the referee for useful comments.

Red squares are for bulges in the case of spirals and flocculents, and bulge-like,\nor centralized clumps in the case of clump clusters. Blue crosses are for clumps outside the\nbulge regions. All mass determinations have had the underlying disk light removed using\nsurface brightness measurements of adjacent regions. Bulges are more massive than clumps\nby a factor of \u223c 20 in spirals and flocculents, but only by a factor of \u223c 2 in clump clusters.\nThe decrease in clump mass for lower redshift is mostly the result of a decrease in general\ngalaxy brightness, which is a cosmological selection effect. The distributions on the right\nsuggest the clump mass per unit galaxy light is nearly independent of redshift.\n\n\f\u2013 49 \u2013\n\n3\nGEMS Clump Clusters\n\nlog (Mass/10\u20130.4Brest)\n\nlog Mass\n\n10\n8\n6\n4\n\n2\n1\n0\n\u20131\n\u20132\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\nRedshift\n\n1.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nRedshift\n\nFig. 9.- Clump mass (left) and ratio of clump mass to total galaxy light (right) versus\nredshift for clumps in the GEMS survey that could be measured in V606 and z850 passbands.\nBackground light from the interclump region is not subtracted from the clump light in this\ncase, so these masses are larger than the pure star-formation masses plotted in the previous\nfigure. The decrease in clump mass for small redshift, combined with the constant clump\nmass per unit galaxy light, indicate that the galaxies are suffering a selection effect based on\nangular resolution and surface brightness, but the clumps inside the galaxies are not.\n\n\f\u2013 50 \u2013\n4\nSpiral\n\n3\n\n2\n1\n0\n\n\u20131\nFlocculent\n\n3\nlog \u03a3interclump\n\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\n2\n1\n0\n\u20131\n\nClump Cluster, Red Disk\n\nClump Cluster, Red Disk\n\n3\n\n3\nlog \u03a3interclump\n\nlog \u03a3clump\u2013\u03a3interclump\n\n1\n\nFlocculent\n\n\u20131\n\n2\n1\n0\n\n2\n1\n0\n\n\u20131\n\n\u20131\nClump Cluster\n\nClump Cluster\n\n3\n\n3\nlog \u03a3interclump\n\nlog \u03a3clump\u2013\u03a3interclump\n\n2\n\n0\n\nBulge\u2013like Clump\nClump\n\n\u20131\nlog \u03a3clump\u2013\u03a3interclump\n\nSpiral\n\n3\nlog \u03a3interclump\n\nlog \u03a3clump\u2013\u03a3interclump\n\n4\n\n2\n1\n0\n\n2\n1\n0\n\n\u20131\n\n\u20131\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\nRedshift\n\n1.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nRedshift\n\nFig. 10.- The redshift distribution of the excess surface density of each clump (left) and\nthe surface density of each interclump region (right), both in M\u2299 pc\u22122 . Red squares are for\nbulges or bulge-like clumps, blue crosses are for non-bulge clumps (for an interclump region,\nthis distinction is based on whether the region was used to subtract the background for a\nbulge or a clump; overlap of a cross and a square on the right means that an interclump\nregion was used for both). Bulges have higher surface densities than clumps by a factor of\n\u223c 7 for spirals and flocculents, and about the same surface densities as clumps for clump\nclusters. The curves plot log(1 + z)4 , which is proportional to the log of the detection limit.\nThe bulges in spirals and flocculents have higher surface densities than the bulges in clump\nclusters by a factor of \u223c 6. On the right, the interclump surface density is a factor of \u223c 3\ntimes higher for spirals, flocculents, and clump clusters with red disks than for clump clusters\nwithout red disks.
