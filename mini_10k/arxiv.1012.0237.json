This allows us to reduce a direct, self-contained\nproof of Yau's theorem.\n\n1. Introduction\nLet K be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. We denote by R the algebra\nof formal power series K[[x1 , . . . , xn ]] and by m the maximal ideal (x1 , . . . , xn ) \u22b3 R. Let\nI \u2282 m be such that S = R/I is a finite-dimensional (or Artin) local algebra with the\nmaximal ideal m\u0304 = m/I.\nConsider the automorphism group Aut S. This is an affine algebraic group with the\ntangent algebra being the Lie algebra of derivations Der S; see [11, Ch.1, \u00a72.3, ex. 2].\nSo the solvability of the connected component of unity (Aut S)\u25e6 (or unity component for\nshort) is equivalent to the solvability of the Lie algebra Der S.\nIn 2009 M. Schulze obtained the following criterion, which has several applications discussed below.\nTheorem 1.1 (Schulze, [12]). Let S = R/I be a finite-dimensional local algebra, where\nI \u2282 ml . If the inequality\n(1.1)\n\ndim(I/mI) < n + l \u2212 1\n\nholds, then the algebra of derivations Der S is solvable.\nThis article provides a generalization of that criterion for a non-local case, see Corollary 4.3, as well as presents a new criterion based on similar techniques, see Theorem 1.12.\nThese two criteria work for different types of algebras.\nTo mention some applications of Schulze's criterion let us consider a regular sequence\nf1 , . . . , fn \u2208 K[x1 , . . . , xn ]1. Equivalently, the quotient S = K[x1 , . . . , xn ]/(f1 , . . . , fn ) is\nnon-trivial and finite-dimensional and is called a global complete intersection.\n1i.e.\n\nthe image of fi in the quotient K[x1 , . . . , xn ]/(f1 , . . . , fi\u22121 ) is not a zero divisor for all i.\n1\n\n\fConjecture 1.2 (Halperin, 19872). Suppose that a finite-dimensional algebra S is a global\ncomplete intersection. Then the unity component (Aut S)\u25e6 of the automorphism group of\nS is solvable.\nJust a few months later H. Kraft and C. Procesi proved the conjecture in the case of\nhomogeneous polynomials.\nTheorem 1.3 (Kraft\u2013Procesi, [9]). Assuming K = C, let f1 , . . . , fn \u2208 K[x1 , . . . , xn ] be\nhomogeneous polynomials, and the algebra\n(1.2)\n\nS = K[x1 , . . . , xn ]/(f1 , . . . , fn )\n\nbe finite-dimensional. Then the unity component (Aut S)\u25e6 is solvable.\nIn this case the algebra S is local. Thereby, the generalization of Theorem 1.3 turns out\nto be a direct consequence of Schulze's Theorem 1.1 as follows.\nCorollary 1.4 (Schulze, [12, Corollary 2]). Given a local complete intersection S =\nR/(f1 , . . . , fn ), the group (Aut S)\u25e6 is solvable.\nProof. We may suppose that fi \u2208 m2 . Then dim(I/mI) = n and so (1.1) is fulfilled.\n\n\u0003\n\nIn Section 4 we introduce a strict criterion for the solvability of the algebra of derivations\nDer S for a non-local finite-dimensional algebra S, see Theorem 4.2. This allows us to\ndeduce the global case of Conjecture 1.2 from the local one, thus to finish its proof.\nNow let us consider isolated hypersurface singularities (or IHS, for short). Let p \u2208\nK[x1 , . . . , xn ] be such that the hypersurface\u0010{p = 0} \u2282\u0011Kn has an isolated singularity\n\u2202p\n\u2202p\nH = ({p = 0}, 0) at the origin. Let J(p) = \u2202x\nbe a Jacobian ideal of p. The\n, . . . , \u2202x\nn\n1\nquotient A(H) = K[[x1 , . . . , xn ]]/(p, J(p)) is called a local algebra or a moduli algebra of the\nIHS H.\nSince the formal power series ring is local, the algebra A(H) is local as well. There is an\nanalogue of the Hilbert Nullstellensatz for the germs of analytic functions (called R\u00fcckert\nNullstellensatz, see [7, Theorem 3.4.4], [1, 30.12], [13]), which holds\np for formal power series\nas well, since there is a purely algebraic proof. So, the radical (p, J(p)) coincides with\nthe maximal ideal m. Thus, the ideal (p, J(p)) contains some degree of the maximal ideal\nor, equivalently, the algebra A(H) is finite-dimensional. Conversely, if the algebra A(H) is\nfinite-dimensional then the singularity H is isolated.\np Indeed, the finite dimensionality of A\nr\nis equivalent to inclusion m \u2282 I for some r, or (p, J(p)) = m. It implies V(p, J(p)) = 0,\nand H is the only singularity in some neighbourhood of zero.\nIt has been proven by J. Mather and S. S.\u2013T. Yau in [10] that two IHS are biholomophically equivalent if and only if their moduli algebras are isomorphic. Thus, the finitedimensional local algebra A(H) defines the IHS H up to an analytic isomorphism.\nIn order to determine when a finite-dimensional local algebra is a moduli algebra of\nsome IHS, S.S.\u2013T. Yau [15] introduced a Lie algebra of derivations L(H) = Der A(H)\ncalled sometimes a Yau algebra and obtained the following result.\n2This\n\nconjecture was proposed by S. Halperin at the conference in honor of J.\u2013L. Koszul.\n2\n\n\fTheorem 1.5 (Yau,[16]). The algebra L(H) is solvable.\nNote that generally the Yau algebra does not uniquely determine its moduli algebra. But\nfor simple singularities this property holds with only one exception. Their classification\nis well known and consists of two infinite series Ak , Dk and three exceptional singularities\nE6 , E7 , E8 ; e.g. see [2, Chapter 2]. A. Elashvili and G. Khimshiashvili proved the following\nfact.\nTheorem 1.6 (Elashvili\u2013Khimshiashvili, [6, Theorem 3.1]). Let H1 and H2 be two simple\nIHS, except the pair A6 and D5 . Then L(H1 ) \u223c\n= L(H2 ) if and only if H1 and H2 are\nanalytically isomorphic.\nRemark 1.7. Assume the polynomial p is quasi-homogeneous, i.e.\n(1.3)\n\np(\u03bbk1 x1 , . . . , \u03bbkn xn ) = \u03bbk p(x1 , . . . , xn ) for some fixed k, k1 , . . . , kn \u2208 N.\n\nThen p \u2208 J(p) and the moduli algebra K[[x1 , . . . , xn ]]/(p, J(p)) is a complete intersection.\nUnder this assumption Theorem 1.5 is a particular case of Corollary 1.4.\nIn [12] M. Schulze deduces Theorem 1.5 from his criterion. In order to prove it he uses\nthe following deep result of G. Kempf.\nTheorem 1.8 (Kempf, [8, Theorem 13]). Let p be a homogeneous polynomial of degree\nd > 3 defined as a regular function on the space Cn endowed with a linear action of a\nsemisimple group G. If the Jacobian J(p) is a G-invariant subspace then there exists such\na G-invariant polynomial q that J(p) = J(q).\nDefinition 1.9. Let us call the finite-dimensional local algebra S an extremal algebra if\nthe equality dim I/mI = l + n \u2212 1 holds.\nThe description of the extremal algebras with a non-solvable algebra of derivations allows to deduce Theorem 1.5 from Schulze's criterion without using the Kemph result, as\nexplained in Section 3.\nDefinition 1.10. Let us say that a graded local finite-dimensional algebra S = R/I is\nnarrow if there holds an inequality\n(1.4)\n\ndim Ik \u2212 dim(m\u0304I)k 6 k for all k = 1, 2 . . . ,\n\nwhere Jk is the kth graded component of a graded ideal J. In other words, there exists\nsuch a set of homogeneous generators of I that the number of generators of degree k is not\ngreater than k for each k.\nRemark 1.11. If I \u2282 mr then for an algebra S = R/I to be narrow it is sufficient to check\nthe inequality for k 6 r, since Ik = (mI)k for k > r.\nRecall that an associated graded algebra of the local algebra S is the algebra gr S =\nK \u2295 (m\u0304/m\u03042 ) \u2295 (m\u03042 /m\u03043 ) \u2295 . . ., i.e. (gr S)i = m\u0304i /m\u0304i+1 . Now introduce a solvability criterion\nas follows.\nTheorem 1.12. Suppose that the associated graded algebra gr S of a local finite-dimensional\nalgebra S is narrow. Then the algebra of derivations Der S is solvable.\n3\n\n\fThe proof is given below. Finally, in the last section we give a lower bound for the dimension of the automorphism group and obtain an algebra with the unipotent automorphism\ngroup.\nLet us mention a related result on solvability of the group of equivariant automorphisms.\nConsider a connected affine algebraic group G and an irreducible affine G-variety X. Assume that the number of G-orbits on X is finite and X contains a G-fixed point. Then the\nunity component (AutG X)\u25e6 of the group of G-equivariant automorphisms of the variety\nX is solvable; see [3, Theorem 1].\n2. Solvability criteria\nIn this section we provide a simplified proof of Theorem 1.1 and introduce a new solvability criterion.\nIf I \u2283 mr \u22b3 K[x1 , . . . , xn ] for some r then R/Ie \u223c\n= K[x1 , . . . , xn ]/I, where Ie is an ideal in\nthe algebra of formal power series generated by I. Therefore it makes no difference whether\nthe local algebra is obtained by factorization of the algebra of polynomials or the algebra\nof formal power series.\nProposition 2.1. Suppose that the ideal I \u22b3 R is represented in the form I = W \u2295 mI.\nThen the ideal (W ) generated by subspace W coincides with I.\nProof. Consider the factorization mapping \u03c6 : R \u2192 R/(W ). The quotient algebra is a local\nalgebra with the maximal ideal \u03c6(m). The decomposition I = W \u2295 mI implies \u03c6(I) =\n\u03c6(mI). Since the ring R is Noetherian, the ideals I and \u03c6(I) are finitely generated. Then\nby Nakayama's Lemma (see [4, Proposition 2.6]) there holds \u03c6(I) = 0, i.e. (W ) = I.\n\u0003\nCorollary 2.2. The minimal number of generators of the ideal I is equal to dim W =\ndim(I/mI).\nNote that Proposition 2.1 does not hold for the algebra of polynomials. For example\ntake an ideal I = m2 \u22b3 K[x] and decompose it as follows,\n(2.1)\n\nm2 = hx2 \u2212 x3 i \u2295 m3 .\n\nIt is easy to see that the ideal (x2 \u2212 x3 ) does not coincide with m2 .\nBelow we follow [12] with some improvements.\nAs always we suppose that S = R/I, where ml \u2283 I \u22b3 R = K[[x1 , . . . , xn ]] for l > 2.\nAssume that the algebra Der S is not solvable. Hence it contains an sl2 -triple {e, f, h} with\nrelations [e, f ] = h, [h, f ] = \u22122f , [h, e] = 2e. Note that the automorphisms of S preserve\nthe maximal ideal m\u0304 \u22b3 S as it is unique. All powers of the maximal ideal are preserved as\nwell. Therefore the ideals m\u0304 and m\u03042 are sl2 -submodules. Since the representations of sl2\nare completely reducible, the ideal m\u0304 contains such an sl2 -submodule V that\n(2.2)\n\nm\u0304 = V \u2295 m\u03042 .\n\nDenote by \u03c6 : R \u2192 S the factorization by the ideal I. Since \u03c6(m2 ) = m\u03042 there exists a\n\u223c\nsubspace V \u2282 m such that m = V \u2295 m2 and \u03c6 : V \u2192 V . Thus, according to Proposition 2.1\n4\n\n\fthe subspace V generates the ideal m and hence the algebra R. So we may assume up to\nthe change of coordinates that V = hx1 , . . . , xn i and V = hx\u03041 , . . . , x\u0304n i, where x\u0304i = \u03c6(xi ).\nWe may introduce an sl2 -representation on V by the given isomorphism and extend it\nto R. Note that the factorization map \u03c6 is a homomorphism of sl2 -modules. Therefore the\nideal I \u22b3 R is an invariant subspace of the sl2 -representation on R.\nGiven a weight vector z, i.e. an eigenvector of the operator h \u2208 sl2 , denote its weight\nby wt(z) \u2208 Z. We may suppose that x1 , . . . , xn are the weight vectors of the sl2 -module\nV , and x1 , . . . , xk , kP6 n, are the highest weight vectors with weights ni = wt(xi ), where\nn1 > . . . > nk > 0, (ni + 1) = n. Denote Vhigh := hx1 , . . . , xk i, Vrest := hxk+1 , . . . , xn i.\nThe ideal mI \u2282 R is sl2 -invariant by the Leibniz rule, hence I contains the complementary sl2 -submodule W such that I = W \u2295 mI. By Corollary 2.2 its basis is a minimal set\ngenerating I.\nSimilarly to V = Vhigh \u2295 Vrest consider the decomposition\n(2.3)\n\nW = Whigh \u2295 Wrest\n\ninto the subspace Whigh = hw1 , . . . , ws i, where wi are the highest weight vectors of W , and\nthe subspace Wrest of the remaining weight vectors of W . Notice that Wrest \u2282 Im f \u2282\n(xk+1 , . . . , xn ) since Im f is spanned by weight vectors which are not of highest weight.\nLet \u03c6i : R \u2192 R/Ji be the factorization by the ideal Ji = (xi+1 , . . . , xn ), i = 1 . . . , k.\nSince Ji \u2283 (xk+1 , . . . , xn ) \u2283 Wrest the equality Wi := \u03c6i (W ) = \u03c6i (Whigh ) holds. Note\nthat dim Wi > i, because K[[x1 , . . . , xi ]]/(Wi ) \u223c\n= S/(x\u0304i+1 , . . . , x\u0304n ) is finite= R/(Ji , Wi ) \u223c\ndimensional. In particular, s > k.\nBy induction we can reorder the highest weight vectors w1 , . . . , ws \u2208 Whigh so that\n\u03c6i (w1 ), . . . , \u03c6i (wi ) become linearly independent in Wi for all i. Then wt(wi ) > lni since wi\ncontains the monomials in variables x\u03041 , . . . , x\u0304i of degree at least l and wt(xj ) = nj > ni for\nj 6 i.\nProof of Theorem 1.1. The deduction above implies that the subspace V contains a nontrivial sl2 -submodule and that n1 > 0. We have\n(2.4) dim I/mI = dim W >\n\nk\nX\n\n(lni + 1) = (n1 \u2212 1)l + l + 1 +\n\ni=1\n\n(n1 \u2212 1) + l + 1 +\n\n(lni + 1) >\n\ni=2\n\nk\nX\ni=2\n\nThus, Theorem 1.1 is proved.\n\nk\nX\n\n(ni + 1) =\n\nk\nX\n\n(ni + 1) + l \u2212 1 = n + l \u2212 1.\n\ni=1\n\n\u0003\n\nProposition 2.3. There exists a natural mapping \u03c6 : Aut S \u2192 Aut(gr S) with a unipotent\nkernel.\nProof. The ideals m\u0304i are invariant under Aut S for all i, since they are powers of the unique\nmaximal ideal. Therefore, Aut S naturally acts on m\u0304i /m\u0304i+1 for all i, hence it acts on gr S.\nWe obtain a natural map \u03c6 : Aut S \u2192 Aut(gr S).\n5\n\n\fTake a basis of S which is consistent with the chain of subspaces 0 \u2282 m\u0304r \u2282 . . . \u2282 m\u0304 \u2282 S.\nConsider an arbitrary operator g \u2208 ker \u03c6. Then g(z) \u2208 z + m\u0304i+1 for any z \u2208 m\u0304i , and g is\nrepresented by a unitriangular matrix in the taken basis. Hence ker \u03c6 is unipotent.\n\u0003\nCorollary 2.4. If the unity component (Aut(gr S))\u25e6 is solvable then the unity component\n(Aut S)\u25e6 is solvable as well.\nTheorem 2.5. The algebra of derivations Der S of a narrow algebra S is solvable.\nProof. Let Der S be non-solvable. Then the deduction above is applicable. Consider a\nsimple sl2 -submodule F = sl2 * w1 \u2282 I. It has a zero intersection with the ideal mI. Let k\nbe the biggest integer such that F \u2282 mk . Then F has a zero intersection with mk+1 as well\nand the highest weight of F is equal to kn1 > k. After factorization by mk+1 it implies\nthat dim Ik > dim(mI)k + dim F > dim(mI)k + k, and the algebra S is not narrow.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 1.12. The desired statement is a direct consequence of Theorem 2.5 and\nCorollary 2.4.\n\u0003\nRemark 2.6. As a matter of fact, Theorem 1.12 can be obtained without Proposition 2.3.\nHowever, then the proof loses in clarity.\nExample 2.7. Algebras\n(2.5)\n\nA =K[x, y]/(x2 , y 3 , xy 2),\n\n(2.6)\n\nB =K[x, y, z]/(x3 , x2 y, x2 z, y 4 , z 4 )\n\nare extremal and Schulze's criterion is not applicable, but their algebras of derivations are\nsolvable due to Theorem 1.12. Actually, the complete automorphism groups of A and B\nare solvable as well. For example, we obtain through a direct calculation\n(\n)\nx\u0304 7\u2192 c1 x\u0304 + a2 x\u0304\u0233 + a3 \u0233 2 ,\nAut A =\nai \u2208 K, ci \u2208 K\u00d7 .\n2\n\u0233 7\u2192 c2 \u0233 + a4 x\u0304 + a5 x\u0304\u0233 + a6 \u0233\nExample 2.8. On the contrary, for the algebra\n(2.7)\n\nA = K[x1 , . . . , xn ]/(xl1 , xl2 , . . . , xln ), where l < n,\n\nSchulze's criterion holds but the criterion of Theorem 1.12 does not. Note that for n > 5\nthe group Aut A is non-solvable, as far as it contains the subgroup of permutations of\ncoordinates.\nThereby, these two criteria have distinct areas of application.\n3. Extremal algebras and Yau's theorem\nRecall that by an extremal algebra we mean the finite-dimensional algebra satisfying the\nequality dim I/mI = l + n \u2212 1 in terms of Theorem 1.1.\n6\n\n\fTheorem 3.1. An extremal algebra S has a non-solvable algebra of derivations Der S if\nand only if it is of the form S = S1 \u2297 S2 , where\n(3.1)\nS1 \u223c\n= K[[x1 , x2 ]]/(xl , xl\u22121 x2 , . . . , x1 xl\u22121 , xl ) for some l > 2,\n1\n\n(3.2)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\nS2 \u223c\n= K[[x3 , . . . , xn ]]/(w2 , . . . , wn\u22121 ),\n\nand wi \u2208 ml \u2229 K[[x3 , . . . , xn ]] form a regular sequence.\nProof. Suppose that S = S1 \u2297 S2 as above. Then the group GL(hx1 , x2 i) may be embedded\ninto Aut S1 , hence the subalgebra S1 carries a natural sl2 -representation. We suppose this\nrepresentation to be trivial on S2 .\nVice-versa, let the algebra of derivations Der S of the local algebra S = R/I be nonsolvable. Recall the deduction from Section 2. Then S is extremal if and only if the\nequalities hold in the chain of inequalities (2.4). The first equality holds if and only if W\ncontains exactly k simple sl2 -submodules, and their weights are ln1 , . . . , lnk . The second\ninequality holds if and only if n1 = 1, n2 = . . . = nk = 0.\nUnder these circumstances k = n \u2212 1, and the simple sl2 -submodules of V are\nhx\u03041 , x\u03042 i, hx\u03043 i, . . . , hx\u0304n i. Then Whigh = hw1 , . . . , wn\u22121 i, where wt(w1 ) = l, wt(wi ) = 0\nfor i = 2, . . . , n \u2212 1. We have\n(3.3)\n\nS = R/(w1 , f * w1 , . . . , f l * w1 , w2 , . . . , wn\u22121 ).\n\nNote that the algebra sl2 annihilates the series w2 , . . . , wn\u22121, hence they do not depend on\nx1 and x2 and belong to K[[x3 , . . . , xn ]] \u2229 ml . Since w1 is the highest vector of weight l it is\nof the form xl1 g, where g \u2208 K[[x3 , . . . , xn ]]. Then f k * w1 = x1l\u2212k xk2 g.\nTaking into accordance xr1 \u2208 I the equality\n(3.4)\n\nl\nxr1 = p0 xl1 g + p1 xl\u22121\n1 x2 g + . . . + pl x2 g + q2 w2 + . . . + qn\u22121 wn\u22121\n\nholds for certain pi , qj \u2208 R. If we substitute x1 for x2 on the right side of equation, we get\n(3.5)\n\np0 + . . . + pel )xl1 g + qe2 w2 + . . . + qen\u22121 wn\u22121 ,\nxr1 = (e\n\nwhere pei = pi (x1 , x1 , x3 , . . . , xn ), qej = qj (x1 , x1 , x3 , . . . , xn ). Clearly, the series qej and\nPl\npe =\nei may be assumed homogeneous in x1 . Then pe = x1r\u2212l pb, qej = xr1 qbj , where\ni=0 p\npb, qbj \u2208 K[[x3 , . . . , xn ]]. But it implies\n(3.6)\n\nxl1 = pbxl1 g + xl1 qb2 w2 + . . . + xl1 qbn\u22121 wn\u22121 .\n\nl\u22121\nl\nThus me can take the sl2 -submodule hxl1 , xl\u22121\n1 x2 , . . . , x1 x2 , x2 i instead of the sl2 submodule hw1 , f * w1 , . . . , f l * w1 i in (3.3).\nFinally, the algebra S decomposes into the tensor product S1 \u2297 S2 , where Si are as\nrequired.\n\u0003\n\nNow let us introduce the following well-known technical lemma for power series, e.g.\nsee [2, Section 11.1]. For an arbitrary power series g denote by g(k) its kth homogeneous\ncomponent.\nLemma 3.2. Suppose p \u2208 m2 \\ m3 \u2282 R. Then up to the analytical change of coordinates\np = x21 + . . . + x2k + q(xk+1 , . . . , xn ), where q \u2208 m3 \u2229 K[[xk+1 , . . . , xn ]].\n7\n\n\fProof. The homogeneous component p(2) is a quadratic form, hence it is of the form x21 +\n. . . + x2k up to the linear change of coordinates. Consider a decomposition in x1 as follows,\n(3.7)\n\np = a0 + a1 x1 + a2 x21 + . . . ,\n\nwhere ai \u2208 K[[x2 , . . . , xn ]] and a2 is invertible.\nNow consider a change of coordinates \u03c6 : x1 7\u2192 x1 + g, x2 7\u2192 x2 , . . . , xn 7\u2192 xn , where\ng \u2208 m \u2229 K[[x2 , . . . , xn ]]. Thus,\n(3.8)\n\n\u03c6(p) = e\na0 + e\na1 x1 + e\na2 x21 + . . .\n\nfor some e\nai \u2208 K[[x2 , . . . , xn ]]. In this case\n(3.9)\n\ne\na1 = a1 + 2ga2 + 3g 2a3 + . . . = a2 (\n\na1\na3\n+ 2g + 3g 2 + . . .).\na2\na2\n\nSince a1 \u2208 m, we can choose such g that e\na1 = 0. Indeed, let us divide a series in parentheses\non the right side of equation (3.9) into homogeneous components. They are of the form\n2g(k) + Pk , where Pk depends only on first k \u2212 1 homogeneous components of g. Thus, by\ninduction all the homogeneous components of the series g are uniquely defined. Note that\ne\na2 = a2 + 3a3 g + 6a4 g 2 + . . . is still invertible.\nTherefore we may suppose that a1 = 0. Consider a change x1 7\u2192 x1 b where b2 = a\u22121\n2\n(other coordinates are untouched). It is easy to see that the required series b exists. It is\na change of coordinates since b is invertible. So, we may as well suppose a2 = 1.\nFinally, consider a change x1 7\u2192 x1 + b2 x21 + b3 x31 + . . .. Similarly to the choice of g, we\nmay take such bi that p 7\u2192 a0 + x21 . By induction by n we may suppose that a0 (x2 , . . . , xn )\nis of a required form. Then p is of a required form as well.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 1.5. According to Yau's remark in [16] we may suppose p \u2208 m3 . Indeed,\nlet p \u2208 m2 \\ m3 . By Lemma 3.2 we have p = x21 + . . . + x2k + q(xk+1 , . . . , xn ) up to the\n\u2202p\nchange of coordinates. Since \u2202x\n= 2xi , i = 1, . . . , k, the equality K[[x1 , . . . , xn ]]/(p, J(p)) \u223c\n=\ni\n3\nK[[xk+1 , . . . , xn ]]/(q, J(q)) holds, and we may take a series q \u2208 m \u2229 K[[xk+1 , . . . , xn ]] instead\nof p.\nIf p \u2208 m3 then I = (p, J(p)) \u2282 m2 and l > 2. We should prove that the Yau algebra\nDer S of the moduli algebra S = K[[x1 , . . . , xn ]]/I is solvable. Assume the contrary.\nNote that dim(I/mI) 6 n + 1 6 n + l \u2212 1. Hence the moduli algebra either satisfy the\ninequality of Schulze's criterion and Der S is solvable, or it is extremal and l = 2. In the latter case Theorem 3.1 may be applied and S = S1 \u2297 S2 , where S1 = K[[x1 , x2 ]]/(x21 , x1 x2 , x22 )\nand S2 = K[[x3 , . . . , xn ]]/(w2 , . . . , wn\u22121 ).\nIt is easy to see that the homogeneous component p(3) has a form p1 (x1 , x2 )+p2 (x3 , . . . , xn ),\nsince otherwise J(p) would contain a series with a term of the form xi xj , where i \u2208\n{1, 2}, j \u2208 {3, . . . , n}. Therefore\n\u001c\n\u001d\n\u2202p1 \u2202p1\n2\n2\n(3.10)\nhx1 , x1 x2 , x2 i \u2282 (p, J(p)) \u2229 (K[x1 , x2 ])2 \u2282\n,\n,\n\u2202x1 \u2202x2\na contradiction.\n\n\u0003\n8\n\n\f4. The global case and Halperin's conjecture\nLet the algebra S = K[x1 , . . . , xn ]/I be a finite-dimensional, not necessarily local algebra.\nSuppose that\nQk \u2208 N\nT an integer\nQ it contains s maximal ideals m\u03041 , . . . , m\u0304s . Then there exists\nsuch that si=1 m\u0304ki = 0. Since the ideals m\u0304ki are coprime, the equation si=1 m\u0304ki = si=1 m\u0304ki\nholds. Finally, by [4, Theorem 8.7] the algebra S can be decomposed into a direct product\nof local subalgebras as follows,\ns\nY\nS/m\u0304ki .\n(4.1)\nS\u223c\n=\ni=1\n\nIn addition, any decomposition of S into the local subalgebras is of the form (4.1), i.e. they\nare uniquely determined up to isomorphism.\nOn the other hand, there is a unique maximal decomposition\n(4.2)\n\n1 = e1 + . . . + et\n\nof the unity into a sum of orthogonal idempotents, i.e. ei ei = ei for all i and ei ej = 0 for\ni 6= j; e.g. see [5, Section II.5]. Then we have the decomposition\n(4.3)\n\nS=\n\nt\nM\n\nei S,\n\ni=1\n\nwhere the subalgebras ei S are indecomposable and hence local. It means that\n(4.4)\nSi = ei S \u223c\n= S/m\u0304k\ni\n\nup to the permutation of indexes and that t = s. Thus, we have a uniquely determined\ndecomposition (4.3) of S into the local subalgebras.\nProposition 4.1. (Aut S)\u25e6 = (Aut S1 )\u25e6 \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 (Aut Ss )\u25e6 .\nProof. Since the unity 1 of algebra S and its decomposition (4.2) are unique, the primary\nidempotents ei in this decomposition are preserved by (Aut S)\u25e6 as well as the subalgebras\nSi . Since Si Sj = 0 for i 6= j, the required statement holds.\n\u0003\nDenote by mi = (x1 \u2212 a1i , . . . , xn \u2212 aniT\n), i = 1 . . . s, the maximal ideals in K[x1 , . . . , xn ]\ncorresponding to m\u03041 , . . . , m\u0304s \u22b3 S. Then si=1 mki \u2282 I. Let us introduce the corresponding\nalgebras of formal power series Ri = K[[x1 \u2212a1i , . . . , xn \u2212ani ]]. The ideal (mj )\u22b3Ri coincides\ne i.\nwith Ri unless i = j. In latter T\ncase (m\u0304i )\u0001\u22b3 Ri is the maximal ideal which we denote by m\ns\nk\nk\ne i = i=1 mi \u2282 (I) \u22b3 Ri holds, and\nTherefore, the inclusion m\n(4.5)\nSi \u223c\n= Ri /(I).\n= K[x1 , . . . , xn ]/(I, mk ) \u223c\n= S/m\u0304k \u223c\ni\n\ni\n\nTaking into account Proposition 4.1, we obtain the following solvability criterion.\n\nTheorem 4.2. The unity component (Aut S)\u25e6 for the finite-dimensional algebra S =\nK[x1 , . . . , xn ]/I with maximal ideals m\u03041 , . . . , m\u0304s is solvable if and only if the unity component (Aut Si )\u25e6 for the local algebra Si = Ri /(I) is solvable for each i = 1 . . . s.\nNow we can prove Halperin's conjecture.\n9\n\n\fProof of Conjecture 1.2. Suppose S = K[x1 , . . . , xn ]/(f1 , . . . , fn ). Since the local subalgebra Si = Ri /(f1 , . . . , fn ) is a local complete intersection, the group (Aut Si )\u25e6 is solvable by\nCorollary 1.4 for each i. Then by Theorem 4.2 the group (Aut S)\u25e6 is solvable as well. \u0003\nTheorem 4.2 allows us to deduce the following globalization of Schulze's criterion.\nCorollary 4.3. Suppose the ideal I \u2282 K[x1 , . . . , xn ] with m generators and an integer l > 1\nbe such that the following holds.\n\u2022 The quotient algebra S = K[x1 , . . . , xn ]/I is finite-dimensional.\n\u2022 For any maximal ideal m \u2282 K[x1 , . . . , xn ] there holds either I * m or I \u2282 ml .\n\u2022 An inequality m < n + l \u2212 1 holds.\nThen the unity component (Aut S)\u25e6 is solvable.\nProof. Let m1 , . . . , ms \u22b3 K[x1 , . . . , xn ] be the only ideals containing I, as above. By Corollary 2.2 there holds dim(I/mi I) 6 m < n + l \u2212 1 and Schulze's criterion is applicable for\nthe algebras Ri /(I), i = 1, . . . , s. Therefore (Aut S)\u25e6 is solvable by Theorem 4.2.\n\u0003\n5. Automorphism subgroups and dimension bounds\nAs usual we assume that the ideal I \u22b3 R contains ml , where l > 2, and the algebra\nS = R/I is finite-dimensional and local with the maximal ideal m\u0304 = (x\u03041 , . . . , x\u0304n ).\nRecall that the sum of all minimal ideals of a finite-dimensional algebra S is called a\nsocle Soc S. It is invariant under endomorphisms of S. An annihilator of an arbitrary\nsubset X \u2282 S is the ideal Ann X = {z \u2208 S | zX = 0}.\nLemma 5.1. Soc S = Ann m\u0304.\nProof. Consider an arbitrary minimal ideal J \u2282 Soc S. Obviously, m\u0304J \u2282 J. But m\u0304J 6= J\nby Nakayama's Lemma. Thus, m\u0304J = 0 and Soc S \u2282 Ann m\u0304.\nSuppose z \u2208 Ann m\u0304. Then zS = {z(c + w) | c \u2208 K, w \u2208 m\u0304} = {cz | c \u2208 K}, so the\nprincipal ideal (z) is one-dimensional and minimal. It implies Ann m\u0304 \u2282 Soc S.\n\u0003\nAssuming that S is graded, Y.-J. Xu and S. S.-T. Yau found a dimension bound for the\ngroup Aut S as follows,\n(5.1)\n\ndim Aut S > dim S \u2212 dim Soc S,\n\nsee [14, Proposition 2.3]. In Theorem 5.4 we introduce a lower bound without this assumption.\nDefinition 5.2. Let us call a lower socle of the algebra S the ideal LSoc S = Soc S \u2229 m\u03042 .\nWe may choose a subspace USoc S \u2282 Soc S such that\n(5.2)\n\nSoc S = USoc S \u2295 LSoc S.\n\nLet us call it an upper socle. Note that the choice of the upper socle is not canonical.\nHowever, up to the change of coordinates we may suppose USoc S \u2282 hx\u03041 , . . . , x\u0304n i.\n10\n\n\fProposition 5.3. The automorphism group of a finite-dimensional local algebra S contains\na unipotent subgroup U \u2282 Aut S with\n(5.3) dim U = dim(LSoc S) * dim(m\u0304/m\u03042 ) + dim(USoc S) * (dim(m\u0304/m\u03042 ) \u2212 dim(USoc S)).\nProof. Suppose that USoc S = hx\u03041 , . . . , x\u0304s i. Consider the unipotent subgroup of linear\ntransformations\n(5.4) U = {u : x\u03041 7\u2192 x\u03041 + F1 , . . . , x\u0304n 7\u2192 x\u0304n + Fn |\nF1 , . . . , Fs \u2208 LSoc S, Fs+1 , . . . , Fn \u2208 Soc S} \u2282 GL(S),\nacting trivially on a subspace h1i \u2295 m\u03042 . It is easy to see that\n(5.5)\n\nu(x\u0304i )u(x\u0304j ) = (x\u0304i + Fi )(x\u0304j + Fj ) = x\u0304i x\u0304j = u(x\u0304i x\u0304j ) for i, j \u2208 {1, . . . , n}, u \u2208 U.\n\nHence\n(5.6)\n\nu(a)u(b) = ab = u(ab) for a, b \u2208 m\u0304, u \u2208 U.\n\nTherefore the U-action is consistent with the multiplication in S, so U \u2282 Aut S. Finally,\n(5.7) dim U = s * dim(Soc S) + (n \u2212 s) * dim(LSoc S) =\ns * dim(USoc S) + n * dim(LSoc S).\n\u0003\nTheorem 5.4. dim Aut S > dim(m\u0304/m\u03042 ) * dim Soc S.\nProof. Consider a subgroup G = GL(USoc S) \u2282 Aut S. Along with the subgroup U from\nProposition 5.3 it generates a subgroup GU \u2282 Aut S. To prove the inequality\n(5.8)\n\ndim GU > dim G + dim U\n\nit suffices to look at the tangent algebras of G and U. Indeed, easy to see that they have\na zero intersection, and\n(5.9) dim GU = dim(Lie GU) > dim(Lie G) + dim(Lie U) =\ndim G + dim U = (dim(USoc S))2 + dim(LSoc S) * dim(m\u0304/m\u03042 )+\ndim(USoc S) * (dim(m\u0304/m\u03042 ) \u2212 dim(USoc S)) = dim(Soc S) * dim(m\u0304/m\u03042 ).\n\u0003\nCorollary 5.5. The group Aut S is infinite if S 6= K.\nClearly, the automorphism group almost always contains a rather big unipotent subgroup. A natural question arises if the whole automorphism group may be unipotent. The\nfollowing proposition provides an example.\nProposition 5.6. Consider the following local algebra\n(5.10)\n\nS = K[x, y]/I,\n\nI = (y 5 , (x + y)6, x5 \u2212 x3 y 3, x4 y).\n\nThen the group Aut S is unipotent.\n11\n\n\fProof.

Let x\u0304, \u0233 be the images of x, y respectively under factorization by I.\nThe basis of algebra S is as follows.\n1 x\u0304\nx\u03042\nx\u03043\nx\u03044 (x\u03045 )\n2\n3\n\u0233 x\u0304\u0233\nx\u0304 \u0233\nx\u0304 \u0233\n2\n2\n2 2\n\u0233 x\u0304\u0233\nx\u0304 \u0233\nx\u03043 \u0233 2\n\u0233 3 x\u0304\u0233 3 x\u03042 \u0233 3 (x\u03043 \u0233 3 )\n\u0233 4 x\u0304\u0233 4 (x\u03042 \u0233 4 )\nwhere \u2212 34 x\u03042 \u0233 4 = x\u03043 \u0233 3 = x\u03045 .\nConsider an arbitrary automorphism \u03c6 \u2208 Aut S,\n(5.12)\n\n\u03c6(x\u0304) = a11 x\u0304 + a12 \u0233 + h1 (x\u0304, \u0233),\n\nh1 \u2208 m2 ,\n\n(5.13)\n\n\u03c6(\u0233) = a21 x\u0304 + a22 \u0233 + h2 (x\u0304, \u0233),\n\nh2 \u2208 m2 .\n\nNote that \u0233 is the only linear polynomial whose 5th power degree is zero. Then \u03c6(\u0233 5) = 0\nimplies a21 = 0. On the other hand, x\u0304 is the only linear polynomial whose 5th degree is\nnot zero but lies in m\u03046 . Therefore,\n(5.14)\n\n\u03c6(x\u0304) = a11 x\u0304 + h1 (x\u0304, \u0233),\n\nh1 \u2208 m2 ,\n\n(5.15)\n\n\u03c6(\u0233) = a22 \u0233 + h2 (x\u0304, \u0233),\n\nh2 \u2208 m2 ,\n\nwhere a11 , a22 6= 0 due to invertibility of \u03c6. Then we should notice that \u03c6((x\u0304 + \u0233)6 ) = 0 if\nand only if a11 = a22 = c. Finally, \u03c6(x3 y 3 \u2212 x5 ) = c6 x3 y 3 \u2212 c5 x5 = 0. It implies that c = 1.\nHence for an arbitrary element z \u2208 m\u0304i an inclusion (Aut S) * z \u2282 z + m\u0304i+1 holds. Thus,\nthe group Aut S is unipotent.\n\u0003\n6.
