Here \"global\" refers to the function field of an algebraic curve.\n1.1. Springer theories: Classical, Local and Global. In this subsection, we\nwill put our new theory in the appropriate historical context by briefly reviewing\nthe classical and local versions of the Springer theories.\n1.1.1. The classical Springer theory. Let us start with a brief review of the classical Springer theory ([S],[L81],[BM],[CG]). The classical Springer theory originated\nfrom Springer's study of Green functions for finite groups of Lie type ([S]). Let\nus state only the Lie algebra version of his result. Let G be a reductive group\nover an algebraically closed field k with Lie algebra g, and let B be the flag variety\nclassifying Borel subgroups of G. Let e\ng be the scheme classifying pairs (\u03b3, B) where\n\u03b3 \u2208 g, B \u2208 B such that \u03b3 \u2208 Lie B. Forgetting the choice of B we get the so-called\nGrothendieck simultaneous resolution:\n(1.1)\n\n\u03c0:e\ng \u2192 g.\n\nFor an element \u03b3 \u2208 g, the fiber B\u03b3 = \u03c0 \u22121 (\u03b3) is called the Springer fiber of \u03b3. These\nare closed subschemes of the flag variety B. If \u03b3 is regular semisimple, B\u03b3 is simply\na W -torsor, where W is the Weyl group of G. In general, B\u03b3 are of higher dimensions and have complicated singularities. Springer constructed representations of\nthe Weyl group W of G on the top-dimensional cohomology of B\u03b3 . Later, with the\ninvention of Intersection Homology and perverse sheaves, a sheaf-theoretic version\nof Springer representations was given by Lusztig ([L81]). He showed that there is\nan action of W on the shifted perverse sheaf \u03c0\u2217 Ql on the affine space g, hence\nincorporating the W -actions on the cohomology of various Springer fibers into a\nfamily. This approach was further developed by Borho-MacPherson ([BM]), and\nthey showed that all irreducible representations of W arise as Springer representations. There are other constructions of Springer representations by KazhdanLusztig ([KL80]) using the Coxeter presentation of W , and by Chriss-Ginzburg\n([CG]) using Steinberg correspondences.\nOne mysterious feature of Springer representations is that the W -action on the\ncohomology of B\u03b3 does not come from an algebraic action of W on the variety B\u03b3 ,\nwhich makes it difficult to calculate. However, it is possible to deduce information\nabout individual Springer representations from the knowledge of the (shifted) perverse sheaf \u03c0\u2217 Ql . The key fact here is that \u03c0\u2217 Ql is the middle extension from a\nlocal system on the regular semisimple locus of g. Hence, in some sense, \"good\"\n(i.e., boring) Springer fibers control \"bad\" (i.e., interesting) ones.\n\n\fTOWARDS A GLOBAL SPRINGER THEORY I\n\n3\n\n1.1.2. The local Springer theory. Since the classical Springer theory is related to\nthe representation theory of G(Fq ), we can think of it as a theory \"over Spec Fq \".\nIt is then natural to ask whether there are corresponding theories over a local field\nsuch as k((t)), or over a global field such as the function field of an algebraic curve\nover a field k. Here k can be any field.\nA local theory (for the local function field F = k((t))) already exists, by work of\nLusztig ([L96]). In the local theory, the loop group G((t)) (the Weil restriction of\nf = X\u2217 (T ) \u22ca W\nG from k((t)) to k) replaces the group G, the affine Weyl group W\nreplaces the finite Weyl group W , and affine Springer fibers (cf. [KL88]) replace\nSpringer fibers. For an element \u03b3 \u2208 g \u2297 k((t)), the affine Springer fiber M\u03b3 is\nthe closed sub-ind-schemes of the affine flag variety F lG parametrizing Iwahori\nsubgroups I \u2282 G((t)) such that \u03b3 \u2208 Lie I. These M\u03b3 are highly non-reduced indschemes, typically with infinitely many irreducible components. In [L96], Lusztig\nf on the homology of affine Springer\nconstructed actions of the affine Weyl group W\nf\nfibers, using the Coxeter presentation of W . However, unlike the classical Springer\ntheory, the local theory does not yet have a satisfactory sheaf-theoretic approach\nwhich allows to organize affine Springer fibers into geometrically manageable families. An essential difficulty is that the parameter \u03b3 of affine Springer fibers naturally\nlives in an infinite-dimensional subspace of g \u2297 k((t)), on which perverse sheaves,\nmiddle extensions, etc are hard to make sense of.\n1.1.3. The global Springer theory. The goal of this series of papers is to give a\nsheaf-theoretic construction of a global Springer theory, i.e., we will start with a\ncomplete smooth connected curve X over k and a reductive group scheme G over\nX. We will mostly be working with the constant group scheme G \u00d7 X (where G\nis a connected reductive group over k); however, our results easily extend to the\ncase of quasi-split group schemes over X, as we will see in [YunIII, Sec. 3.1]. For\nconvenience we will assume that the base field k is algebraically closed; for later\napplications to the harmonic analysis of p-adic groups, we will take k to be a finite\nfield.\nThe global Springer theory, besides being an analogue of the classical and local\nSpringer theories, is also inspired by two other sources of ideas. One is B-C.Ng\u00f4's\nrecent proof of the Fundamental Lemma ([N08]); the other is the \"mirror symmetric\" viewpoint of the geometric Langlands program, proposed by Kapustin-Witten\n([KW]).\nThe Fundamental Lemma is an identity of orbital integrals in p-adic harmonic\nanalysis conjectured by Langlands-Shelstad, but its proof relies heavily on geometry.\nThe geometry involved in the proof consists of a local part and a global part.\nThe local part was studied by the pioneer work [GKM04] of Goresky-KottwitzMacPherson, where they interpreted the orbital integrals as the number of points\non affine Springer fibers. The global part was initiated by Laumon-Ng\u00f4 ([LN])\nand finalized by Ng\u00f4. In [N08], Ng\u00f4 considers the (generalized) Hitchin fibration\nf Hit : MHit \u2192 AHit (for definition, see Sec. 3.1.1). The number of points on\nthe Hitchin fibers (fibers of f Hit ) are given by global orbital integrals. Ng\u00f4's work,\nespecially the product formula [N08, Prop. 4.13.1], makes it clear that Hitchin fibers\nare the correct global analogue of affine Springer fibers in the affine Grassmannian\nGrG . In this paper, we propose the parabolic Hitchin fibers as the global analogue\nof the affine Springer fibers M\u03b3 in the affine flag variety F lG mentioned in Sec.\n\n\f4\n\nZHIWEI YUN\n\n1.1.2. These are fibers of the parabolic Hitchin fibration\nf par : Mpar \u2192 AHit \u00d7 X.\nFor definition of the spaces involved, see Def. 3.1.2. We consider f par as the\nglobal analogue of the Grothendieck simultaneous resolution \u03c0 in (1.1). As a first\nstep towards a global Springer theory, in Sec. 4 we will construct an action of\nf = X\u2217 (T ) \u22ca W on the parabolic Hitchin complex f\u2217par Ql (more precisely, on its\nW\nrestriction to an open subset A \u00d7 X \u2282 AHit \u00d7 X, see Rem. 3.5.6). Taking stalks\nf on the cohomology of the parabolic Hitchin\nof f\u2217par Ql , we get representations of W\npar\nfibers Ma,x for any (a, x) \u2208 A \u00d7 X. In fact, we will do more. We will construct an\naction of the graded double affine Hecke algebra on the complex f\u2217par Ql in [YunII,\nf -action.\nSec. 3], extending the W\nThe other source of ideas that inspired the global Springer theory is the new perspective of the geometric Langlands program from mirror symmetry, as proposed\nHit\nby Kapustin-Witten in [KW]. In this picture, Hitchin fibrations MHit\nG and MG\u2228\n\u2228\nfor the group G and its Langlands dual G serve as \"classical limits\" of a mirror\npair, and the geometric Langlands conjecture predicts an equivalence between the\nHit\nderived categories of coherent sheaves on MHit\nG and MG\u2228 . Moreover, this conjectural equivalence is expected to transform 'tHooft operators on Dcoh (MHit\nG ) (coming\nfrom certain Hecke correspondences) into Wilson operators on Dcoh (MHit\nG\u2228 ) (tensor\nproduct with certain tautological bundles). What we will prove in [YunIII, Sec. 4]\nis reminiscent of this conjecture, or rather its shadow on the level of cohomology.\nRoughly speaking, we will identify the stable parts of the parabolic Hitchin complexes for G and G\u2228 , and show that the lattice part of the global Springer action\n(which are analogues of 'tHooft operators) transforms to certain Chern class action\n(which are analogues of Wilson operators) under this identification. In other words,\nthe two lattice actions that are encoded in the graded double affine Hecke algebra\naction mentioned above get interchanged under Langlands duality.\n1.2. New features of the global Springer theory. The construction of the\nglobal Springer action are essential different from the construction of classical or\nlocal Springer actions. On one hand, compared to the affine Springer fibers in the\nlocal theory, parabolic Hitchin fibers have the advantage of naturally forming a\nflat family over a finite-dimensional base. This enables us to give a sheaf-theoretic\nconstruction. On the other hand, compared to the classical theory, the parabolic\nHitchin complex f\u2217par Ql does not lie in a single perverse degree as the Springer sheaf\n\u03c0\u2217 Ql does, hence the middle extension approach of Lusztig in [L81] fails in the global\nsituation. To get around this difficulty, we use cohomological correspondences to\nf -action on the complex f\u2217par Ql . Construction of this flavor already\nconstruct the W\nexisted for the classical Springer theory, using Steinberg correspondences (see [CG]\nfor a topological approach, see also Sec. 4.1 for a brief review). In the global theory,\nwe consider cohomological correspondences supported on the Hecke correspondences\nHeckepar (see Sec. 4.2). A key geometric fact that makes this construction work is\nthe codimension estimate of certain strata in A (see Prop. 3.5.5), proved by Ng\u00f4\nin [N08] on the basis of the work of Goresky-Kottwitz-MacPherson in [GKM06].\nAlthough the parabolic Hitchin complex f\u2217par Ql fails to lie in a single perverse\ndegree, it is (non-canonically) a direct sum of shifted simple perverse sheaves, each\nbeing a middle extension from its restriction to the regular semisimple locus of A\u00d7X\n(see the Support Theorem in [YunIII, Sec. 2]). In this sense, our previous remark on\n\n\fTOWARDS A GLOBAL SPRINGER THEORY I\n\n5\n\nthe classical Springer theory still holds in the global situation: the \"good\" (i.e., less\ninteresting) parabolic Hitchin fibers control the bad (i.e., more interesting) ones.\nHere, \"good\" parabolic Hitchin fibers are disjoint unions of torsors under abelian\nvarieties, as opposed to discrete set of points in the classical or local theory.\nThe global Springer theory has a few new features that are not shared by the classical theory. Some of these features should exist in the local theory but are technically more difficult to obtain. The first interesting feature is the non-semisimplicity\nof the affine Weyl group action. More precisely, the action of the lattice part X\u2217 (T )\nf on H\u2217 (Mpar\nof W\na,x ) are not semisimple in general. In [YunIII, Sec. 5], we will work\nout an example in the case of G = SL(2) to illustrate this phenomenon.\nThe second new feature is that global Springer theory carries richer and more\ninteresting symmetry than the classical and local ones. There are at least three\npieces of symmetry acting on the parabolic Hitchin fibration f par : Mpar \u2192 A \u00d7 X:\nthe first is the affine Weyl group action on f\u2217par Ql to be constructed in this paper;\nthe second is the cup product of Chern classes of certain line bundles on Mpar ; the\nthird is the action of a Picard stack P on Mpar (see Sec. 3.2). This Picard stack\naction is analogous to the action of the centralizer G\u03b3 of the element \u03b3 on B\u03b3 in\nthe classical situation. A large part of the second paper [YunII] of the series will\nbe devoted to the study of the interplay among these three pieces of symmetry:\nwe will show in [YunII, Sec. 3] that the first and the second pieces of symmetry\ntogether give an action of the graded double affine Hecke algebra on f\u2217par Ql ; we\nwill also study the relation between the third piece of symmetry (the cap product)\nand the first two in [YunII, Sec. 5].\nThe third new feature is that notions such as endoscopy and Langlands duality\nfrom the modern theory of automorphic forms naturally show up in the context of\nglobal Springer theory. Endoscopic groups come into the picture when we try to\nunderstand the direct summands of f\u2217par Ql which are supported on proper closed\nsubsets of A \u00d7 X. In [YunIII, Sec. 3] we will prove the Endoscopic Decomposition\nTheorem, which reduces the study of these direct summands to groups smaller than\nG, the endoscopic groups. The Langlands dual group comes into the story when we\ntry to understand the global Springer action on those direct summands of f\u2217par Ql\nwhich are support on the whole A \u00d7 X. We will prove in [YunIII, Sec. 4] that\nthe lattice part of the global Springer action can be understood via certain Chern\nclasses acting on the parabolic Hitchin complex for the Langlands dual group G\u2228 ,\nand vice versa.\n\n1.3. Main Results. Let X be a projective smooth connected curve over an algebraically closed field k. Let G be a reductive group over k. Fix a Borel subgroup B\nof G. Fix a divisor D on X with deg(D) \u2265 2gX (gX is the genus of X). The parabolic Hitchin moduli stack Mpar = Mpar\nG,X,D is the algebraic stack which classifies\nquadruples (x, E, \u03c6, ExB ), where x is a point on X, E is a G-torsor over X, \u03c6 is a\nglobal section of the vector bundle Ad(E) \u2297 OX (D) on X, and ExB is a B-reduction\nof the restriction of E at x compatible with \u03c6. For a concrete description of this\nstack in the case of G = GL(n), see Example 3.1.10.\nLet T be the quotient torus of B (the universal Cartan) and t be its Lie algebra.\nLet c = t W = g G = Spec k[f1 , * * * , fn ] be the GIT adjoint quotient, with\nfundamental invariants f1 , * * * , fn of degree d1 , * * * , dn . Let AHit = AHit\nG,X,D be the\n\n\f6\n\nZHIWEI YUN\n\nHitchin base:\nAHit =\n\nn\nM\n\nH0 (X, OX (di D)).\n\ni=1\n\nThe morphism\nf par : Mpar \u2192 AHit \u00d7 X\n(x, E, \u03c6, ExB ) 7\u2192 (f1 (\u03c6), * * * , fn (\u03c6), x)\nis called the parabolic Hitchin fibration. In the case of GL(n), the fibers of f par can\nbe described in terms of the compactified Picard stack of the spectral curves, see\nExample 3.1.10. The direct image complex f\u2217par Ql of the constant sheaf Ql under\nthe morphism f par is called the parabolic Hitchin complex. In the following, we will\nrestrict the parabolic Hitchin complex to an open subset A of AHit . If char(k) =\n0, we can A to be the anisotropic locus Aani of AHit (see Definition 3.2.10). If\nchar(k) > 0, we let A \u2282 Aani to be the locus where the codimension estimate in\nProp. 3.5.5 holds. It is expected by Ng\u00f4 that this codimension estimate holds\nunconditionally in any characteristic, in which case we could always take A = Aani .\nIn any case, A is nonempty if and only G is semisimple. We automatically restrict\nall stacks over AHit to the open subset A, without changing notations.\nIn Sec. 3.4, we show that Mpar is a smooth Deligne-Mumford stack and f par is a\nproper morphism.

In Sec. 3, we define and study the geometry of the parabolic Hitchin\nfibrations. In Sec. 4, we prove the two main results above, after introducing Hecke\ncorrespondences between parabolic Hitchin moduli stacks. In App. A, we review\nthe general formalism of cohomological correspondences, with emphasis on graphlike correspondences (see subsection A.5).\n\n\fTOWARDS A GLOBAL SPRINGER THEORY I\n\n7\n\nf -action on\n1.4. Preview of [YunII], [YunIII]. In [YunII], we will extend the W\npar\nf\u2217 Ql to the action of the graded double affine Hecke algebra (DAHA) on f\u2217par Ql .\nWe also generalize this action to \"parahoric versions\" of Hitchin stacks. We then\nstudy the interaction of the graded DAHA action and the cap product action given\nby the Picard stack P.\nIn [YunIII], we study the decomposition of the complex f\u2217par Ql according to\ncharacters of X\u2217 (T ). We will prove the Endoscopic Decomposition Theorem, which\nlinks certain direct summands of f\u2217par Ql to the endoscopic groups of G. This result\ngeneralizes Ng\u00f4's geometric stabilization of the trace formula in [N08]. The second\nresult links the stable parts of the parabolic Hitchin complexes for Langlands dual\ngroups, and establishes a relation between the global Springer action on one hand\nand certain Chern class action on the other. As we mentioned in Sec. 1.1.3, this\nresult is inspired by the mirror symmetry between dual Hitchin fibrations. Finally,\nwe present the first nontrivial example in the global Springer theory.\nWe will make remarks on the applications of the Endoscopic Decomposition\nTheorem in the Introduction of [YunIII].\nAcknowledgment.

Notations and conventions\nIn this section, we fix notations and conventions for all the papers in the series.\n2.1. General notations. Throughout these papers, we work over a fixed algebraically closed field k. All fiber products of stacks without specified base are\nunderstood to be fiber products over k. We fix a prime l different from char(k).\nAll torsors are right torsors unless otherwise stated.\nSuppose X (resp. Y) is a stack with right (resp. left) action of a group scheme\nA over k, then we write\nA\n\nX \u00d7 Y := [(X \u00d7 Y)/A]\nfor the stack quotient of X\u00d7Y by the anti-diagonal right A-action: a \u2208 A(R) acts on\nX(R) \u00d7 Y(R) by (x, y) 7\u2192 (xa, a\u22121 y), for any k-algebra R and x \u2208 X(R), y \u2208 Y(R).\nFor a group A and a group B acting on A via a homomorphism \u03c1 : B \u2192 Aut(A),\nwe can form the semidirect product A \u22ca\u03c1 B. When the action \u03c1 is clear from the\ncontext, we often write A \u22ca B for simplicity.\nFor a group A acting on an abelian group A, let V A \u2282 V be the invariants and\nV \u0589 VA be the coinvariants under the A-action.\nFor an algebraic torus T , let X\u2217 (T ) and X\u2217 (T ) be its cocharacter and character\nlattices.\nFor a commutative group scheme (or a Picard stack which is Deligne-Mumford)\nP over S with connected fibers, let Vl (P/S) = Tl (P/S) \u2297Zl Ql be the sheaf of\nQl -Tate modules of P over S.\n\n\f8\n\nZHIWEI YUN\n\nFor a morphism of schemes f : X \u2192 Y, let Pic(X/Y) be the Picard stack over Y\nclassifying line bundles along the fibers of f . Let Pic(X/Y), if exists, be the relative\nPicard scheme classifying line bundle along the fibers of f . Similarly, for any torus\nT , we define PicT (X/Y) and PicT (X/Y) to be the Picard stack and Picard scheme\nof T -torsors along the fibers of f .\nFor a flat morphism f : X \u2192 Y, we denote its relative dimension (the dimension\nof any geometric fiber) by dim(f ) or, if the morphism is clear from the context, by\ndim(X/Y).\n2.2. Notations concerning the curve X. For most part of these papers (except the Appendices on cohomological correspondences), we fix X to be a smooth\nconnected projective curve over k of genus gX .\nFor any k-algebra R, let XR = Spec R \u00d7Spec k X. If x \u2208 X(R) is an R-point of\nX, let \u0393(x) \u2282 XR be the graph of x : Spec R \u2192 X. We let\n(2.1)\n\nbx ;\nDx = Spec O\n\nbpunc = Dx \u2212 \u0393(x)\nD\u00d7\nx = Spec Ox\n\nbe the spectra of the formal completion and the punctured formal completion of\nXR along \u0393(x). In general, for any scheme S and any x \u2208 X(S), we also let\n\u0393(x) \u2282 S \u00d7 X be the graph of x : S \u2192 X.\nFor a line bundle L (or a divisor D) over X, we let \u03c1L (or \u03c1D ) denote the\ncomplement of the zero section in the total space of the line bundle L (or OX (D)).\nThis is naturally a Gm -torsor.\nFor a divisor D on X and a quasi-coherent sheaf F on X, we write F (D) :=\nF \u2297OX OX (D).\nLet D be a divisor on X and let Y be a stack over X with a Gm -action such\nthat the structure morphism Y \u2192 X is Gm -invariant. Then we define\n(2.2)\n\nGm\n\nYD := \u03c1D \u00d7 X Y = [(\u03c1D \u00d7X Y)/Gm ].\n\nIf Y is a stack over k, with no specified morphism to X from the context, we also\nwrite\n(2.3)\n\nGm\n\nYD := \u03c1D \u00d7 Y = [(\u03c1D \u00d7 Y)/Gm ].\n\n2.3. Notations concerning the reductive group G. Throughout these papers,\nwe fix G to be a connected reductive group over k of semisimple rank n, and we fix\na Borel subgroup B of G with universal quotient torus T .\nFor each maximal torus in B we get a Weyl group. If we use elements in B to\nconjugate one torus to another, their Weyl groups are canonically identified. Let\nW denote this canonical Weyl group. Similarly, the based root system \u03a6+ \u2282 \u03a6 \u2282\nX\u2217 (T ) and the based coroot system \u03a6\u2228,+ \u2282 \u03a6\u2228 \u2282 X\u2217 (T ) are canonically defined.\nLet Z\u03a6\u2228 \u2282 X\u2217 (T ) be the Z-lattice spanned by the coroots \u03a6\u2228 .\nThroughout the Thesis, we assume that char(k) does not divide the order of W .\nLet\nWaff := Z\u03a6\u2228 \u22ca W,\nf := X\u2217 (T ) \u22ca W\nW\n\nbe the affine Weyl group and the extended affine Weyl group of G.\nLet g, b, t be the Lie algebras of G, B, T respectively. Let c be the GIT quotient\ng G = t W = Spec k[f1 , * * * , fn ]. The affine space c inherits a weighted Gm -action\nfrom t such that fi is homogeneous of degree di \u2208 Z\u22651 .\n\n\fTOWARDS A GLOBAL SPRINGER THEORY I\n\n9\n\nLet crs be the regular semisimple locus of c, which is the complement of the\ndiscriminant divisor \u2206 \u2282 c. For a stack X or a morphism F over c or c/Gm , we use\nXrs and F rs to denote their restrictions to crs or crs /Gm .\n2.4. Sheaf-theoretic notations. For a Deligne-Mumford X, let Dcb (X) denote\nthe derived category of constructible Ql -complexes on X. We will consider both\nthe usual t-structure on Dcb (X) and the perverse t-structure on Dcb (X). We follow\nthe notation of [BBD] concerning the perverse t-structures. For an object F \u2208\nDcb (X), let \u03c4\u2264i F and p \u03c4\u2264i F be the truncations of F under the usual and perverse tstructures; let Hi F and p Hi F be the cohomology sheaves and perverse cohomology\nsheaves of F .\nLet f : X \u2192 Y be a morphism of Deligne-Mumford stacks. When the morphism\nf is clear from the context, we will use H\u2217 (X/Y) to denote the homology complex\nf! f ! Ql,Y on Y, and use H\u2217 (X/Y) to denote the cohomology complex f\u2217 Ql,X on Y.\nWe also set\nHi (X/Y) :=\ni\n\nH (X/Y) :=\n\nH\u2212i (H\u2217 (X/Y));\nHi (H\u2217 (X/Y)) = Ri f\u2217 Ql,X .\n\nIf U \u2282 Y is an open substack, we sometimes abuse the notation and simply write\nH\u2217 (X/U ), etc. to mean H\u2217 (f \u22121 (U )/U ), etc. If Y = Spec k, we simply write H\u2217 (X)\nand H\u2217 (X) for the homology and cohomology groups of X.\nFor a morphism f : X \u2192 Y, we sometimes use DX/Y or Df to denote the relative\ndualizing complex f ! Ql . When Y = Spec k, we simply write DX for the dualizing\ncomplex of X, and we recall that the Borel-Moore homology (homology with closed\nsupport) is defined as\n\u2212i\nHBM\ni (X) := H (X, DX ).\n\nLet F 7\u2192 F (1) be the usual Tate twist in Dcb (X). We sometimes need a half Tate\ntwist (1/2) only for notational convenience. In these situations, we formally add a\nsquare root of Ql (1) to the category Dcb (X).\n3. The parabolic Hitchin fibration\nIn this section, we introduce the main object of our study, the parabolic Hitchin\nmoduli stack and the parabolic Hitchin fibration. We study their basic geometric\nproperties, such as smoothness, flatness, product formula, etc., parallel to the study\nof the Hitchin fibration by Ng\u00f4 in [N08]. Many proofs in this section are borrowed\nfrom their counterparts in loc.cit. with slight modification.\n3.1. The parabolic Hitchin moduli stack. In this subsection, we define the\nparabolic Hitchin moduli stack and the parabolic Hitchin fibration. We first recall\nthat BunG is the moduli stack classifying G-torsor over the curve X. Let Bunpar\nG be\nthe moduli stack of G-torsors on X with a B-reduction at a point. More precisely,\nB\nfor any scheme S, Bunpar\nG (S) is the groupoid of triples (x, E, Ex ) where\n\u2022 x : S \u2192 X with graph \u0393(x);\n\u2022 E is a G-torsor over S \u00d7 X;\n\u2022 ExB is a B-reduction of E along \u0393(x).\n\n\f10\n\nZHIWEI YUN\n\n3.1.1. The parabolic Hitchin moduli stack. Fix a divisor D = 2D\u2032 on X (the assumption that D is the square of another divisor is only used to construct a global\nKostant section later, cf. [N08, 2.2] and (3.14)). Assume deg(D) \u2265 2gX (gX is the\ngenus of X).\nRecall from [N06, Def. 4.2.1] that the (generalized) Hitchin moduli stack MHit =\nMHit\nG,X,D is the functor which sends a scheme S to the groupoid of Hitchin pairs\n(E, \u03c6) where\n\u2022 E is a G-torsor over S \u00d7 X;\n\u2022 \u03c6 \u2208 H0 (S \u00d7 X, Ad(E) \u2297OX OX (D)) is called a Higgs field.\nG\n\nHere Ad(E) = E \u00d7 g is the adjoint bundle associated to E.\n3.1.2. Definition. The parabolic Hitchin moduli stack (or more precisely, Hitchin\nmoduli stack with parabolic structures) Mpar = Mpar\nG,X,D is the functor which sends\na scheme S to the groupoid of quadruples (x, E, \u03c6, ExB ), where\n\u2022 x : S \u2192 X with graph \u0393(x);\n\u2022 (E, \u03c6) \u2208 MHit\nG,X,D (S) is a Hitchin pair;\n\u2022 ExB is a B-reduction of E along \u0393(x),\nsuch that \u03c6 is compatible with ExB , i.e.,\n\u03c6|\u0393(x) \u2208 H0 (\u0393(x), Ad(ExB ) \u2297OS x\u2217 OX (D))\n3.1.3. Remark. When part or all of the data (G, X, D) is clear from the context,\nwe will omit it from the subscripts of Mpar\nG,X,D .\nForgetting the Higgs field \u03c6 gives a morphism Mpar \u2192 Bunpar\nG and forgetting\nthe choice of the B-reduction gives a morphism\n\u03c0M : Mpar \u2192 MHit \u00d7 X.\nWe give a second (but equivalent) definition of Mpar . By [N06, Sec. 4], the\nHitchin moduli stack can be interpreted as classifying sections\nGm\n\nX \u2192 [g/G]D := \u03c1D \u00d7 [g/G].\nHere [g/G] is the adjoint quotient stack of g by G, \u03c1D is the Gm -torsor over X\nassociated to the line bundle OX (D) (for the meaning of the twisting (\u2212)D in\ngeneral, see Sec. 2.1). We have an evaluation morphism\nevHit : MHit \u00d7 X \u2192 [g/G]D .\nConsider the D-twisted form of the Grothendieck simultaneous resolution:\n\u03c0 : [b/B]D \u2192 [g/G]D .\nIt it easy to see that\n3.1.4.

The Hitchin base. Recall that the Hitchin base space AHit is the affine space\nGm\n\nof all sections of X \u2192 cD . Here the twisting cD := \u03c1D \u00d7 c uses the weighted Gm action on c inherited from the Gm -action on t by homotheties. Fixing homogeneous\ngenerators f1 , * * * , fn of the coordinate ring Symk (t\u2217 )W of c, we can write\n(3.2)\n\nn\nM\n\nAHit =\n\nH0 (X, OX (di D)).\n\ni=1\n\nwhere di is the degree of fi .\nThe morphism [g/G]D \u2192 cD induces the Hitchin fibration (see [N08, 4.1])\nf Hit : MHit \u2192 AHit .\n\n(3.3)\n\n3.1.6.

Lemma. Recall that deg(D) \u2265 2gX . Then Ae is smooth.\n\nProof. The affine space bundle cD over X is non-canonically a direct sum of line\nbundles of the form O(eD), each having degree \u2265 2gX since e \u2265 1. Therefore the\nline bundle O(eD) is globally generated. Hence the evaluation map\nAHit = H0 (X, cD ) \u00d7 X \u2192 cD\nis a surjective bundle map over X (the source is a trivial vector bundle), therefore\nit is smooth. This shows that the evaluation map AHit \u00d7 X \u2192 cD is smooth.

We make a few remarks about the various open subsets of AHit\nthat will appear in the sequel:\nAHit \u2283 A\u2665 \u2283 Aani \u2283 A \u2283 A0 \u2283 A\u2666 .\nIn [N06, Def. 4.4], Ng\u00f4 introduced the open subscheme A\u2665 \u2282 AHit consisting of\nthose a : X \u2192 cD which generically lies in the regular semisimple locus crs\nD \u2282 cD . In\n[N08, 6.1], he introduced the open subset Aani , which we will recall in Def. 3.2.10.\nWe will define the subset A in Rem. 3.5.6, and we will mostly be working over A.\nIf char(k) = 0, A = Aani , and it is expected that they are equal in general. The\nopen subset A0 will be introduced in Sec. 3.5. The open subset A\u2666 introduced\nin [N08, 4.6] consists of those sections a : X \u2192 cD which are transversal to the\ndiscriminant divisor in cD .\n3.1.10. Example. We describe the parabolic Hitchin stack and the parabolic Hitchin\nfibration in concrete terms when G = GL(n).

In this subsection, we study the\nPicard stack action on the parabolic Hitchin stack.\n3.2.1. Facts about regular centralizers. We first recall a few facts about the regular\ncentralizer group schemes following [N08, Chapter 2].\nLet IG \u2192 g be the universal centralizer group scheme: for any z \u2208 g, the fiber\nIG,z is the centralizer Gz of z in G. Let greg be the open subset of regular (i.e.,\ncentralizers have minimal dimension) elements in g. According to [N08, Lemme\n2.1.1], there is a smooth group scheme J \u2192 c, called the group scheme of regular\ncentralizers together with an Ad(G)-equivariant homomorphism\n(3.8)\n\n\uf6beG : \u03c7\u2217 J := Jg \u2192 IG\n\nwhich is an isomorphism over greg (here \u03c7 : g \u2192 c is the adjoint quotient). In other\nwords, the stack BJ (over c) acts on the stack [g/G], such that [greg /G] becomes a\nJ-gerbe over c.\nLet Jb be the pull-back of J to b. Let IB be the universal centralizer group\nscheme of the adjoint action of B on b. We claim that\n3.2.2. Lemma. There is a natural homomorphism \uf6beB : Jb \u2192 IB such that \uf6beG |b\n\uf6beB\nfactors as Jb \u2212\u2192 IB \u2192 IG |b .\nProof. For x \u2208 breg := b \u2229 greg , we have canonical identifications Jx = IG,x = IB,x\n(cf. [N08, Lemme 2.4.3]). This gives the desired map \uf6beB over breg . To extend \uf6beB\nto the whole b, we can use the same argument as in [N06, Prop. 3.2], because Jb is\nsmooth over b and b \u2212 breg has codimension at least two.\n\u0003\nAs in the situation of Jg , we can say that the stack BJ acts on the stack [b/B]\nover c.\nLet Jt be the pull-back of J along t \u2192 c. Recall the following fact\n3.2.3. Lemma ([N08], Prop. 2.4.2). There is a W -equivariant homomorphism of\ngroup schemes over t:\n\uf6be T : Jt \u2192 T \u00d7 t\nwhich is an isomorphism over trs . Here the W -structure on Jt = J \u00d7c t is given\nby its left action on t, while the W -structure on T \u00d7 t is given by the diagonal left\naction.\nMoreover, J carries a natural Gm -action such that J \u2192 c is Gm -equivariant,\ntherefore it makes sense to twist J by the Gm -torsor \u03c1D over X and get JD \u2192 cD .\n\n\f14\n\nZHIWEI YUN\n\n3.2.4. The Picard stack P. Recall from [N08, 4.3.1] that we have a Picard stack\ng : P \u2192 AHit whose fiber Pa over a : S \u2192 AHit (viewed as a morphism a : S \u00d7 X \u2192\ncD ) classifies Ja := a\u2217 JD -torsors on S \u00d7 X. According to [N06, Prop. 5.2], P is\nsmooth over A\u2665 . Since BJD acts on [g/G]D , P acts on MHit preserving the base\nAHit .\nThere is an open dense substack MHit,reg \u2282 MHit parametrizing those (E, \u03c6) :\nX \u2192 [g/G]D which land entirely in [greg /G]D . Since [greg /G]D is a BJD -gerbe over\ncD , MHit,reg is a P-torsor over AHit .\nLem. 3.2.2 implies that BJD acts on [b/B]D , compatible with its action on\n[g/G]D , and preserving the morphism [b/B]D \u2192 tD . Using the moduli interpretations of Mpar and P, we get\n3.2.5. Lemma. The Picard stack P acts on Mpar . The action is compatible with its\naction on MHit and preserves the enhanced parabolic Hitchin fibration fe : Mpar \u2192\ne In other words, if we let P\ne = Ae \u00d7AHit P, viewed as a Picard stack over A,\ne then\nA.\npar\ne\ne\nP acts on M\nover A.\n\nWe describe this action on the level of S-points. Let (a, x) \u2208 AHit (S) \u00d7 X(S)\nand (x, E, \u03c6, ExB ) \u2208 Mpar (S) be a point over it. An S-point of P is the same as a\nJa -torsor QJ over S \u00d7 X. Then the effect of the QJ -action is\n\n(3.9)\n\nQJ * (x, E, \u03c6, ExB ) = (x, QJ\n\nJa ,\uf6beG\n\n\u00d7 (E, \u03c6), QJ\n\nJa ,\uf6beB\n\n\u00d7 ExB ).\n\n3.2.6. Example. We continue with Example 3.1.10 of G = GL(n). For a \u2208 A\u2665 (k),\nPa = Pic(Ya ) is the Picard stack of line bundles on Ya . The action of L \u2208 Pa on\nMpar\na,x is given by\nL * (F0 \u2283 F1 \u2283 * * * ) = (L \u2297 F0 \u2283 L \u2297 F1 \u2283 * * * )\nwhere the tensor products are over OYa .\n3.2.7. Lemma. Let Mpar,reg \u2282 Mpar be the preimage of MHit,reg under the forgetful\ne and the morphism\nmorphism Mpar \u2192 MHit . Then Mpar,reg is a torsor under P,\nHit,reg\npar,reg \u223c\ne\n\u00d7A A.\n\u03bdM induces an isomorphism M\n=M\nProof. Restricting the Cartesian diagram (3.1) to MHit,reg \u00d7 X, we get\n(3.10)\n\nMpar,reg\n\nevpar\n\n\u03c0M\n\n\u000f\u000f\n\nMHit,reg \u00d7 X\n\n// [breg /B]D\n\n// tD .\nqt\n\n\u03c0\nev\n\nHit\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// [greg /G]D\n\n\u000f\u000f\n\n// cD\n\nNotice that the square on the RHS above is also Cartesian, by a well-known result of\nKostant in [K]. The outer Cartesian square of (3.10) implies that \u03bdM : Mpar,reg \u223c\n=\nHit,reg\npar,reg\nHit,reg\ne\ne\nis a P-torsor, M\nis a PM\n\u00d7A A is an isomorphism. Since M\ntorsor.\n\u0003\ne For\n3.2.8. Construction. We will construct a tautological T -torsor QT over P.\nHit\nJ\n\u2217 J\nany a \u2208 A (S) and any Ja -torsor Q over S \u00d7 X, the pull-back qa Q is a qa\u2217 Ja torsor over the cameral curve Xa . By Lem. 3.2.3, we have a natural homomorphism\nof group schemes over Xa :\n\uf6bea : qa\u2217 Ja \u2192 T \u00d7 Xa .\n\n\fTOWARDS A GLOBAL SPRINGER THEORY I\n\n15\n\n\u2217\nqa\nJa ,\uf6bea\n\nTherefore we can form the induced T -torsor QT := qa\u2217 QJ \u00d7 T over Xa . Since \uf6bea\ne Hit )W\nis W -equivariant, QT carries a strong W -equivariant structure. Let PicT (A/A\nHit\ne\nbe the stack of strong W -equivariant objects in PicT (A/A ) (see Sec. 2.1 for the\nnotation). The assignment QJ 7\u2192 QT gives a morphisms of Picard stacks over AHit\ne\nand A:\n(3.11)\n\n\uf6beP\n\n(3.12)\n\n\uf6bePe\n\ne Hit )W ;\n: P \u2192 PicT (A/A\ne \u2192 Ae \u00d7AHit PicT (A/A\ne Hit )W .\n: P\n\ne Hit )W we have the usual Poincar\u00e9 T -torsor PoinT . Then\nOver Ae \u00d7AHit PicT (A/A\nwe define\nQT := \uf6be\u2217Pe PoinT .\nevpar\n\nNote that Mpar also naturally sits over BT via Mpar \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 [b/B]D \u2192 BT , which\ngives a T -torsor LT over Mpar .\n3.2.9. Lemma. There is a natural 2-morphism making the following diagram commutative:\nPe \u00d7Ae Mpar\n\n(3.13)\n\nQT\n\nact\n\n// Mpar\nLT\n\nLT\n\n\u000f\u000f\n\u000f\u000f\nBT \u00d7 BT\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// BT\n\nmult\n\nHere \"act\" is the action map and \" mult\" stands for the multiplication on the Picard\nstack BT induced from the multiplication on T .\nProof. Let a \u2208 AHit (S), QJ \u2208 Pa (S) be a Ja -torsor over S \u00d7 X and (x, E, \u03c6, ExB ) \u2208\nMpar (S) be a point over a, which also gives a point x\ne \u2208 Xa (S). By Construction\ne\n3.2.8, the fiber of QT over the point (e\nx, QJ ) \u2208 P(S)\nis the T -torsor\nQTxe := x\ne\u2217 QJ\n\nx\ne\u2217 Ja ,\uf6be\n\n\u00d7\n\nT\n\n\u2217\n\nover S = \u0393(e\nx) \u2282 Xa . Here \uf6be : x\ne Ja \u2192 T is induced from \uf6beT .\nOn the other hand, The fiber of LT over the point (x, E, \u03c6, ExB ) is the T -torsor\nB\n\nExT := ExB \u00d7 T over \u0393(x). By the description of the P-action on Mpar given in\n(3.9), after twisting by QJ , the T -torsor ExT becomes the T -torsor\n(e\nx\u2217 QJ\n\nx\ne\u2217 Ja ,\uf6beB\n\n\u00d7\n\nB\n\nExB ) \u00d7 T \u223c\ne\u2217 QJ\n=x\n\nx\ne\u2217 Ja ,\uf6be\n\n\u00d7\n\nT\n\nExT = QTxe \u00d7 ExT .\n\nwhich is precisely the product of QTxe (the fiber of QT at (e\nx, QJ )) and ExT (the\nT\nB\nfiber of L at (x, E, \u03c6, Ex )) under the multiplication on BT . This completes the\nproof.\n\u0003\nFinally we recall the following definition.\n3.2.10. Definition ([N08], Lemme 6.1.1). The anisotropic open subset Aani \u2282 A\u2665\nis the open locus of a \u2208 A\u2665 (k) where \u03c00 (Pa ) is finite.\nOver Aani , P is Deligne-Mumford and of finite type.\n\n\f16\n\nZHIWEI YUN\n\n3.2.11. Remark. Since we work with a constant group scheme G over k, the\nanisotropic locus Aani is nonempty if and only if G is semisimple. In general,\nif the constant group G is replaced by a quasi-split reductive group scheme H over\nX, the anisotropic locus Aani is nonempty if and only if the split center of H is\ntrivial.\n3.3. The local-global product formula. In this subsection, we will relate parabolic Hitchin fibers to products of affine Springer fibers.\n3.3.1. The local counterpart of Mpar .

(1) To prove the smoothness, we do several steps of d\u00e9vissage and reduce to\nthe proof of [N08, Th. 4.12.1]. Let R be an artinian local k-algebra and I \u2282 R a\nsquare-zero ideal. Let R0 = R/I. Fix a point x \u2208 X(R) with image x0 \u2208 X(R0 )\nand a point m0 = (x0 , E0 , \u03c60 , ExB0 ) \u2208 Mpar (R0 ) over x0 \u2208 X(R0 ). To establish\nthe smoothness of Mpar \u2192 X, we need to lift this point to a point (x, E, \u03c6, ExB ) \u2208\nMpar (R).

Also, as a subsheaf of the vector bundle Ad(E0 ) over XR0 , F is\nlocally free over OX .\nThe obstruction to the lifting lies in H1 (XR0 , KI ).

By the expression (3.17), we may reduce to showing the vanishing\nof H1 (XR0 , K) in the case R0 is a field. We may assume R0 = k otherwise make\na base change for X from k to R0 and the argument is the same. In this case, as\nin the proof of [N08, Th. 4.12.1], using Serre duality, we reduce to showing that\nH0 (X, K\u2032 ) = 0 where\nAd(\u03c60 )\n\nK\u2032 = ker(F \u2228 (\u2212D) \u2297 \u03c9X \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 F \u2228 \u2297 \u03c9X )\n\n\fTOWARDS A GLOBAL SPRINGER THEORY I\n\n19\n\nHere F \u2228 = RHomX (F , OX ) is a subsheaf of Ad(E0 )\u2228 (x0 ) (the sheaf of rational\nsections of Ad(E0 )\u2228 with at most a simple pole at x0 ).

In our case, deg(D) \u2265 2gX so this condition holds, therefore\nH0 (X, K\u2032\u2032 ) = 0, hence H0 (X, K\u2032 ) = 0. This proves the vanishing of the obstruction\ngroup H1 (XR0 , KI ) in general, and completes the proof of smoothness of Mpar \u2192\nX.\n(2) The relative dimension of Mpar \u2192 X at a k-point (x0 , E0 , \u03c60 , ExB0 ) is the\nEuler characteristic \u03c7(X, K) of the complex H\u2217 (X, K). Recall that K fits into the\ndistinguished triangle\ne \u2192 Q \u2192 K[1]\nK\u2192K\nwhere\ne\nK\n\n=\n\nQ =\n\nAd(\u03c60 )\n\n[Ad(E0 ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Ad(E0 )(D)];\nAd(\u03c60 )\n\ni\u2217 [i\u2217 Ad(E0 )/Ad(ExB0 ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 i\u2217 Ad(E0 )/Ad(ExB0 ) \u2297 i\u2217 OX (D)].\n\ne But by the calculation\nIt is clear that \u03c7(X, Q) = 0. Therefore \u03c7(X, K) = \u03c7(X, K).\nHit\ne is the dimension of M\nin [N08, 4.12], \u03c7(X, K)\nG,X,D at the k-point (E0 , \u03c60 ). Since\nHit\npar\nM\nis equidimensional by [N08, 4.4.6], M\n\u2192 X is also equidimensional of\nrelative dimension equal to dim MHit .\n(3) By [N08, Prop. 6.2.2], MHit |Aani is Deligne-Mumford. By Lem. 3.1.4,\n\u03c0M : Mpar \u2192 MHit \u00d7 X is schematic and of finite type because the Grothendieck\nsimultaneous resolution \u03c0 is. Therefore Mpar |Aani is Deligne-Mumford.\n\u0003\n3.4.2. Corollary. The parabolic Hitchin fibrations f par : Mpar |A\u2665 \u2192 A\u2665 \u00d7 X\nand fe : Mpar |A\u2665 \u2192 Ae are flat. The fibers are local complete intersections. The\nrestrictions of f par and fe to Aani are proper.\n\nProof. The source and the target of the maps f par and fe are smooth and equidimensional. In both cases, the relative dimensions are equal to dim MHit \u2212dim AHit .\nBy Cor. 3.3.4, the dimension of the fibers of f par and fe are also equal to the dimension of Hitchin fibers, which, in turn, equals to dim MHit \u2212 dim AHit by [N08,\nProp. 4.14.4]. Therefore by [H, Ch. III, Exercise 10.9], both maps are flat and the\nfibers are local complete intersections.\nBy [N08, Prop. 6.1.5], MHit |Aani is proper over Aani . By Lem. 3.1.4, Mpar |Aani\nis proper over MHit |Aani \u00d7X and MHit |Aani \u00d7Aani Aeani because they are obtained by\nbase change from the proper maps [b/B]D \u2192 [g/G]D and [b/B]D \u2192 [g/G]D \u00d7cD tD .\nTherefore Mpar |Aani is proper over Aani \u00d7 X and Aeani .\n\u0003\n\n\u2665\npar\n\u2192A\n3.4.3. Corollary. The pre-image Mpar\na of any a \u2208 A (k) under the map M\nis reduced and flat over X.\n\nProof. The flatness over X follows by base changing f par to {a}\u00d7X. Over the open\n\u22121\n\u223c Hit \u22121 (Ua ).\ndense locus Ua = a\u22121 (crs\n(Ua ) is smooth, and Mpar\na |Ua = Ma \u00d7q\nD ) \u2282 X, q\nHit\npar\nSince Ma is reduced by [N08, Corollaire 4.14.4], Ma |Ua is also reduced. By\npar\npar\nflatness, Mpar\na |Ua is dense in Ma . Moreover, Ma is a local complete intersection\n\n\f20\n\nZHIWEI YUN\n\nby Cor. 3.4.2, hence it does not admit embedded components. Therefore Mpar\nis\na\nalso reduced.\n\u0003\n3.4.4. Remark. The parabolic Hitchin fibers Mpar\na,x are not reduced in general. For\nexample, suppose qa : Xa \u2192 X is ramified over x and qa\u22121 (x) consists of smooth\nHit\n\u22121\n\u22121\npoints of Xa , then Mpar\na,x = Ma \u00d7 qa (x) is not reduced because qa (x) is not.\n3.4.5. Remark. Although Pa still has an open orbit in Mpar,reg\n\u2282 Mpar\na,e\nx\na,e\nx (where\nx\ne \u2208 Xa ) which is a torsor under Pa , this open set may not be dense in Mpar\na,e\nx : there\nmight be other irreducible components, as we will see in [YunIII, Sec. 4.1].\n3.5. Stratification by \u03b4 and codimension estimate.\n3.5.1. The global \u03b4. Recall that in [N08, 3.7 and 4.9], Ng\u00f4 introduced local and\nglobal Serre invariants \u03b4. The global invariant is the dimension of the affine part\nof the Picard stack Pa . It defines an upper semi-continuous function\n(3.18)\n\n\u03b4 : Aani \u2192 Z\u22650 .\n\nFor an integer \u03b4 \u2265 0, let Aani\nbe the \u03b4-level set of Aani .\n\u03b4\n3.5.2. Lemma. The open subset Aani\nof Aani consists precisely of points a \u2208 Aani\n0\nHit,reg\nHit\nwhere Ma\n= Ma .\nProof. When \u03b4(a) = 0, each component of the Picard stack Pa is an abelian stack,\nand \u03c00 (Pa ) is finite, hence Pa is proper. Therefore MHit,reg\n, being a torsor under\na\nHit,reg\nPa , is also proper. Since MHit,reg\nis open dense in MHit\n=\na\na , we must have Ma\nHit\nMa .\nHit,reg\nis proper because MHit\n= MHit\nConversely, if MHit,reg\na is proper.\na , then Ma\na\nHit,reg\nis a Pa -torsor, Pa is also proper. Hence the affine part of Pa is\nSince Ma\nzero-dimensional, i.e., \u03b4(a) = 0.\n\u0003\n3.5.3. The local \u03b4. The local Serre invariant ([N08, 3.7]) assigns to every (a, x) \u2208\n(Aani \u00d7 X)(k) the dimension of the corresponding affine Springer fiber MxHit (\u03b3a,x )\n(see the discussion before Prop. 3.3.3 for the meaning of \u03b3a,x ), or, equivalently, the\ndimension of the local symmetry group Px (Ja ). It defines an upper semi-continuous\nfunction\n(3.19)\n\n\u03b4 : Aani \u00d7 X \u2192 Z\u22650\n\nFor an integer \u03b4 \u2265 0, let (Aani \u00d7 X)\u03b4 be the \u03b4-level set. For any a \u2208 Aani (k), we\nhave\nX\n\u03b4(a, x).\n\u03b4(a) =\nx\u2208X(k)\nani\n\n3.5.4. Lemma. The open subset (A \u00d7 X)0 is precisely the locus where \u03bdM :\nMpar |Aani \u2192 MHit |Aani \u00d7Aani Aeani is an isomorphism.\n\nProof. We need to check that for a geometric point (a, x) \u2208 Aani (k) \u00d7 X(k), \u03bdM is\nan isomorphism over (a, x) if and only if \u03b4(a, x) = 0. By the left-most Cartesian\nsquare of the diagram (3.7), \u03bdM is an isomorphism over a geometric point (E, \u03c6, x) \u2208\nMHit \u00d7 X if and only if \u03bd : [b/B] \u2192 [g/G] \u00d7c t is an isomorphism over \u03c6(x) \u2208 g.\nThis is equivalent to saying that \u03c6(x) \u2208 greg , by the result of Kostant (cf. [K]).\nNow for (a, x) \u2208 Aani \u00d7 X, \u03bdM is an isomorphism over (a, x) if and only if\n\u03bdM is an isomorphism over all (E, \u03c6, x) \u2208 MHit\na \u00d7 X. The above argument shows\n\n\fTOWARDS A GLOBAL SPRINGER THEORY I\n\n21\n\nthat this is equivalent to requiring evx : MHit\n\u2192 [g/G]D to land in [greg /G]. Let\na\nbx ) be chosen as in Prop. 3.3.3. Recall from [N08, 3.3] that we have\n\u03b3a,x \u2208 g(O\nan open sub-ind-scheme MxHit,reg (\u03b3a,x ) \u2282 MxHit (\u03b3a,x ) defined in a similar way as\nMHit,reg\n, and which is a torsor under Px (Ja ). The above discussion implies that\na\n\u03bdM is an isomorphism over (a, x) if and only if MxHit (\u03b3a,x ) = MxHit,reg (\u03b3a,x ). We\nhave to show that this condition is equivalent to \u03b4(a, x) = 0.\nIf \u03b4(a, x) = 0, then MxHit (\u03b3a,x ) = MxHit,reg (\u03b3a,x ) by [N08, Corollaire 3.7.2].\nConversely, suppose MxHit (\u03b3) = MxHit,reg (\u03b3). According to [N08, 4.13] and\n[KL88], there is a lattice subgroup \u039b \u2282 Px (Ja ) which acts freely on MxHit (\u03b3) such\nthat \u039b\\MxHit,red (\u03b3) is a projective variety and \u039b\\Pxred(Ja ) is an affine group scheme.\nTherefore \u039b\\MxHit,red (\u03b3) = \u039b\\MxHit,reg,red (\u03b3) is both proper and affine since the\nlatter is a torsor under \u039b\\Pxred(Ja ). Hence they must be zero-dimensional, i.e.,\n\u03b4(a, x) = 0. This completes the proof.\n\u0003\nRecall the following codimension estimate:\n3.5.5. Proposition (Ng\u00f4 [N08], Prop. 5.4.2).\n(1) If char(k) = 0, then the codimension of Aani\nin Aani is at least \u03b4.\n\u03b4\n(2) If char(k) > 0, then for any \u03b40 , there exists a positive integer N (\u03b40 ) such\nthat whenever deg(D) \u2265 N (\u03b40 ) and \u03b4 \u2264 \u03b40 , the codimension of Aani\nin Aani\n\u03b4\nis at least \u03b4.\n3.5.6. Remark. Most of the results in this series of papers will depend on this\nestimate. From now on, we fix an open subset A \u2282 Aani on which the estimate\ncodimA (A\u2229Aani\n\u03b4 ) \u2265 \u03b4 holds for any \u03b4 \u2208 Z\u22650 . According to Prop. 3.5.5, if char(k) =\n0, we can take A = Aani . In the case char(k) > 0, we can for example take A to be\nthe union of Aani\nfor all \u03b4 \u2264 \u03b40 , as long as deg(D) \u2265 N (\u03b40 ). In fact, it is expected\n\u03b4\nthat the estimate codim(Aani\n\u03b4 ) \u2265 \u03b4 holds for any \u03b4 regardless of char(k). If this was\nproved, we could always take A = Aani .\nWe use A\u03b4 and (A \u00d7 X)\u03b4 to denote the level sets of the global and local Serre\ninvariants on A and A \u00d7 X.\nWe have an easy consequence of the above codimension estimate.\n3.5.7. Corollary. For \u03b4 \u2265 1, the codimension of (A \u00d7 X)\u03b4 in A \u00d7 X is at least\n\u03b4 + 1.\nProof. For any a \u2208 Aani (k) there are only finitely many x \u2208 X(k) such that\n\u03b4(a, x) > 0. In other words, for \u03b4 \u2265 1, the projection (A \u00d7 X)\u03b4 \u2192 A\u03b4 is quasi-finite.\nHence\ndim(A \u00d7 X) \u2212 dim(A \u00d7 X)\u03b4 \u2265 dim(A \u00d7 X) \u2212 dim(A\u03b4 ) \u2265 \u03b4 + 1.\n\n\u0003\n\n4. Construction of the affine Weyl group action\nWe first review two constructions of the classical Springer representations, one\nusing middle extension of perverse sheaves and the other using Steinberg correspondences. It turns out that the second construction generalizes to the global\nsituation. We introduce Hecke correspondences in the context of parabolic Hitchin\nfibration, which play the role of Steinberg correspondences in the classical theory.\nWe then use them to construct the affine Weyl group action on the parabolic Hitchin\ncomplex.\n\n\f22\n\nZHIWEI YUN\n\nIn this section, we will always restrict to the open subset A \u2282 Aani fixed as\nin Rem. 3.5.6. All stacks over AHit will be automatically restricted to A, without\nchanging of notation.\nFor a stack X or a morphism F over A \u00d7 X, we use X0 and F 0 to denote their\nrestrictions on the open subset (A \u00d7 X)0 \u2282 A \u00d7 X (the locus where \u03b4(a, x) = 0, see\n(3.19)). For example, we have Ae \u2283 Ae0 \u2283 Aers .\n4.1. Review of classical Springer representations. In this subsection, we recall two constructions of the Weyl group action on the direct image complex for\nB\n\nthe Grothendieck simultaneous resolution \u03c0 : e\ng = b \u00d7 G \u2192 g. Note that over the\nregular semisimple locus crs , we have a Cartesian diagram\n(4.1)\n\ne\ngrs\n\n// trs\nqtrs\n\n\u03c0 rs\n\n\u000f\u000f\n\ngrs\n\n\u03c7\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// crs\n\nThe left action of W on t gives a right action: w acts by t * w = Ad(w)\u22121 t. Under\nthis right W -action, \u03c0 rs and qtrs both become right W -torsors.\nThe first construction uses middle extension of perverse sheaves.\n4.1.1. Construction (see [L81],[BM]). Since \u03c0 rs realizes e\ngrs as a right W -torsor\nrs\nover g , we get a left action of W on \u03c0\u2217 Ql |grs given by pulling back along the action\nmaps. It is well-known that \u03c0 is a small map, so that \u03c0\u2217 Ql is the middle extension\n(after shift to the perverse degree) from its restriction on grs . Therefore, this left\nW -action uniquely extends to a left W -action on \u03c0\u2217 Ql .\nThe second construction uses cohomological correspondences.\n4.1.2. Construction (cf. [CG] for a treatment over C). Consider the self-product\n[b/B] \u00d7[g/G] [b/B] = [St/G]\ng is the Steinberg variety of triples. We view St as a correspondence\nwhere St = e\ng \u00d7g e\n\u2190\n\u2212\ns\n\nSt >\n>> \u2192\n>>\u2212s\n>>\n>\u001f\u001f\n\n\u007f\u007f\ne\ng>\n>>\n>>\n\u03c0 >>\n>\u001f\u001f \u007f\u007f\ng\n\ne\ng\n\n\u03c0\n\nWith respect to the open subset U = grs , St satisfies the condition (G-2) in Def.\nA.5.1 (in fact, this is equivalent to saying that \u03c0 is a small map). Moreover, we have\na natural map \u03bc : St \u2217 St \u2192 St given by forgetting the middle e\ng, which is obviously\nassociative. By the discussion in Sec. A.6, Corr(St; Ql , Ql ) and Corr(Strs ; Ql , Ql )\nhave natural algebra structures given by convolutions. The top-dimensional irreducible components of St are indexed by w \u2208 W , such that Strs\nw is the graph of the\nright w-action on e\ngrs , i.e., Strs\nconsists\nof\npoints\n(x,\nx\n*\nw)\n=\n(x,\nw\u22121 x) for x \u2208 e\ngrs .\nw\n\n\fTOWARDS A GLOBAL SPRINGER THEORY I\n\n23\n\nTherefore, we have an algebra isomorphism\nQl [W ]\n\n\u223c\n\n\u223c\n\noo\n// H0 (Strs , D\u2190\n\u2212\ns)\n\n\u2212\nH0 (St, D\u2190\ns)\n\n\u2240\n\n\u2240\n\n\u000f\u000f\n\nCorr(Strs ; Ql , Ql ) oo\n\n\u223c\n\n\u000f\u000f\nCorr(St; Ql , Ql )\n\nwhere Ql [W ] is the group algebra of W . Under this isomorphism, w corresponds\nto the fundamental class [Stw ]. By Prop. A.6.2, we get an algebra homomorphism\n(\u2212)#\n\nQl [W ] \u223c\n= Corr(St; Ql , Ql ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Endg (\u03c0\u2217 Ql )\nsending w to [Stw ]# . In other words, we get a left W -action on \u03c0\u2217 Ql .\n4.1.3. Lemma. Constructions 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 give the same W -action on \u03c0\u2217 Ql .\nProof. Over grs , the two constructions are obviously the same because Strs\nw is the\ngraph of the right w-action on e\ngrs (cf. Example A.5.3). Since \u03c0\u2217 Ql is the middle\nextension (up to shift) of its restriction on grs , the restriction map\nEndg (\u03c0\u2217 Ql ) \u2192 Endgrs (\u03c0\u2217 Ql |grs )\nis an isomorphism. Therefore, the two constructions yield the same action over\ng.\n\u0003\n4.2. The Hecke correspondence.

The\ntransposition C \u2228 has two projections:\n\u2190\n\u2212 \u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\nc\u2228 = \u2212\nc :C \u2192Y;\nc\u2228 = \u2190\nc : C \u2192 X.\n\n\fTOWARDS A GLOBAL SPRINGER THEORY I\n\n35\n\nThe Verdier duality functor gives an isomorphism\n\u223c\n\nD(\u2212) : Corr(C; F , G) \u2192 Corr(C \u2228 ; DG, DF )\n\u2192\n\u2212\nwhich sends the map \u03b6 : \u2212\nc \u2217G \u2192 \u2190\nc !

In this subsection, we\nassume X to be smooth and equidimensional of dimension d. We will introduce a\nclass of correspondences which will be useful in construting global Springer actions.\nA.5.1. Definition. Let U \u2282 S be an open subscheme. A correspondence C between\nX and Y over S is said to be left graph-like with respect to U if it satisfies the\nfollowing conditions:\n\u2212\n(G-1) The projection \u2190\nc : CU \u2192 XU is \u00e9tale.\n(G-2) dim CU \u2264 d and the image of C \u2212 CU \u2192 X \u00d7S Y has dimension strictly\nless than d.\n\u2192\nSimilarly, C is said to be right graph-like with respect to U if \u2212\nc : CU \u2192 XU is \u00e9tale\nand (G-2) is satisfied; C is said to be graph-like with respect to U if it is both left\nand right graph-like.\nNote that the inequality dim CU \u2264 d is certainly implied by (G-1); we leave it\nhere because sometimes we will refer to condition (G-2) alone without assuming\n(G-1).\nA.5.2. Lemma. Suppose C is a correspondence between X and Y over S satisfying\n(G-2) with respect to U \u2282 S. Let \u03b6, \u03b6 \u2032 \u2208 Corr(C; Ql,X , Ql,Y ). If \u03b6|U = \u03b6 \u2032 |U \u2208\n\u2032\nCorr(CU ; Ql,XU , Ql,YU ), then \u03b6# = \u03b6#\n\u2208 HomS (g! Ql,Y , f\u2217 Ql,X ).\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\nProof. Let Z be the image of \u2190\nc and \u2190\nz ,\u2212\nz : Z \u2192 X be the projections. Under the\nabove assumptions, after choosing a fundamental class of X, we can identify Ql,X\n\u2212\nwith DX [\u22122d](\u2212d), hence identify D\u2190\nz with DZ [\u22122d](\u2212d). Similar remark applies\nto ZU . Consider the restriction map\nBM\n\u22122d\nj \u2217 : H\u22122d (Z, DZ )(\u2212d) = HBM\n(ZU , DZU )(\u2212d).\n2d (Z)(\u2212d) \u2192 H2d (ZU )(\u2212d) = H\n\nBoth sides have a basis consisting of fundamental classes of d-dimensional irreducible components of Z or ZU . By condition (G-2), the d-dimensional irreducible\ncomponents of Z and ZU are naturally in bijection. Therefore j \u2217 is an isomorphism,\nand the restriction map\n0\n\u2212\n\u2212\nCorr(Z; Ql,X , Ql,Y ) = H0 (Z, D\u2190\nz ) = Corr(ZU ; Ql,XU , Ql,YU )\nz ) \u2192 H (ZU , D\u2190\n\u2192\n\u2032\nc \u2217 \u03b6)|U =\nis also an isomorphism. Since \u03b6|U = \u03b6 |U \u2208 Corr(CU ; Ql,XU , Ql,YU ), hence (\u2190\n\u2190\n\u2192\n\u2190\n\u2192\n\u2190\n\u2192\n\u2032\n\u2032\n( c \u2217 \u03b6 )|U \u2208 Corr(ZU ; Ql,XU , Ql,YU ), therefore c \u2217 \u03b6 = c \u2217 \u03b6 \u2208 Corr(Z; Ql,X , Ql,Y ).\n\u2192\nIt remains to apply Lem. A.1.2 to \u2190\nc : C \u2192 Z.\n\u0003\n\nA.5.3. Example. Let \u03c6 : X \u2192 Y be a morphism over S and \u0393(\u03c6) be its graph\nin X \u00d7S Y , then \u0393(\u03c6) is obviously a left graph-like correspondence between X\nand Y . Let [\u0393(\u03c6)] \u2208 H0 (\u0393(\u03c6), D\u0393(\u03c6)/X ) = H0 (\u0393(\u03c6)) be the class of the constant\nfunction 1, or the fundamental class of \u0393(\u03c6) relative to X. Then the homomorphism\n[\u0393(\u03c6)]# : g! Ql,Y \u2192 f\u2217 Ql,X is\n\u03c6\u2217\n\n[\u0393(\u03c6)]# : g! Ql,Y \u2192 g\u2217 Ql,Y \u2212\u2192 f\u2217 Ql,X .\n\n\fTOWARDS A GLOBAL SPRINGER THEORY I\n\n37\n\nA.5.4. Integration along a correspondence. For a correspondence C between X and\nY over S satisfying (G-2) with respect to some U \u2282 S, we have the fundamental\nclass [CU ] \u2208 HBM\n2d (C)(\u2212d), defined as the sum of the fundamental classes of the\nclosures of d-dimensional irreducible components of CU . Using the fundamental\nclass of X, we can identify Ql,X with DX [\u22122d](\u2212d), and get a quasi-isomorphism\n\u223c\n\u2212\nD\u2190\nc = DC [\u22122d](\u2212d).\n\u2212\nTherefore [CU ] can be viewed as a class in H0 (C, D\u2190\nc ) = Corr(C; Ql,X , Ql,Y ). We\nclaim that the induced map [CU ]# : g! Ql,Y \u2192 f\u2217 Ql,X is independent of U . In fact,\nif C also satisfies the condition (G-2) with respect to another V \u2282 S, then it again\nsatisfies (G-2) with respect to U \u2229 V . Since [CU ] and [CV ] both restrict to [CU\u2229V ]\nin Corr(CU\u2229V ; Ql , Ql ), Lem. A.5.2 implies that [CU ]# = [CV ]# . Therefore it is\nunambiguous to write\n[C]# : g! Ql,Y \u2192 f\u2217 Ql,X ,\n\nwhich is the sheaf-theoretic analogue of integration along the correspondence C.\nNow we study the composition of such integrations. We use the notation in the\ndiagram (A.8). Let X, Y be smooth, equidimensional and Y be proper over S.\nA.5.5. Proposition. Assume C2 is left graph-like and C1 , C = C1 \u2217 C2 satisfy\ncondition (G-2) with respect to some U \u2282 S, then\n[C1 ]# \u25e6 [C2 ]# = [C]# : h! Ql,Z \u2192 f\u2217 Ql,X .\nSimilarly, if we assume C1 is right graph-like and C2 , C = C1 \u2217 C2 satisfy condition\n(G-2) with respect to some U \u2282 S, the same conclude holds.\nProof. We prove the first statement. The proof follows from a sequence of d\u00e9vissages.\nBy Lem. A.3.1, it suffices to prove\n[C1 ] \u25e6Y [C2 ] = [C] \u2208 Corr(C; Ql,X , Ql,Z ).\nBy property (G-2) and Lem. A.5.2, it suffices to prove\n(A.11)\n\n\u2212\n[C1,U ] \u25e6YU [C2,U ] = [CU ] \u2208 H0 (CU , D\u2190\nc ).\n\n\u2190\n\u2212\nTherefore we have reduced to the case where \u2190\nc\u22122 , and hence d are \u00e9tale. In this\ncase, we can identify D\u2190\nwith Ql,C2 . Under this identification, the convolution\nc\u2212\n2\nproduct becomes\n\u2212\nH0 (C1 , D\u2190\n) \u2297 H0 (C2 ) \u2192 H0 (C, D\u2190\nc\u2212\nc ).\n1\nand [C2 ] becomes the class of constant function 1 in H0 (C2 ). Therefore, convolution\n\u2190\n\u2212\nwith [C2 ] becomes the pull-back along the \u00e9tale morphism d :\n\u2190\n\u2212\u2217\n\u2212\nd : H0 (C1 , D\u2190\n) \u2192 H0 (C, D\u2190\nc\u2212\nc ).\n1\n\u2190\n\u2212\u2217\nIt is obvious that d [C1 ] = [C]. Therefore (A.11) is proved.\n\u0003\nA.5.6. Remark. The proposition fails if we only assume \u2190\nc\u22122 : C2 \u2192 Y to be quasi1\nfinite. For example, take X = Y = Z = P and S = pt. Let C2 be the union of the\ndiagonal and the graph of z 7\u2192 z \u22121 in P1 \u00d7 P1 . Let C1 be the graph of the constant\nmap to 1 \u2208 P1 . The the reduced structure of the composition C is the same as C1 ,\nthe constant graph. However, the action of [C]# on H0 (X) is the identity while the\naction of [C1 ]# \u25e6 [C2 ]# on H0 (X) is twice the identity.\n\n\f38\n\nZHIWEI YUN\n\nA.6. The convolution algebra. Assume X is smooth of equidimension d and\nf : X \u2192 S is proper. Let C be a self correspondence of X over S satisfying (G-2).\nAssume we have a morphism \u03bc : C \u2217C \u2192 C as correspondences which is associative,\ni.e., the following diagram is commutative:\nC \u2217 C \u2217MC\nMMM\nqq\nq\nMidMM\u2217\u03bc\nq\nq\nq\nMMM\nq\nq\nq\n&&\nxxq\nC \u2217C\nC \u2217 CM\nMMM\nq\n\u03bc qqq\nMM\u03bcM\nq\nq\nMMM\nq\nM&& xxqqqq\nC\n\u03bc\u2217id\n\nThen the convolution gives a multiplication on Corr(C; Ql,X , Ql,X ):\n\u25e6\n\n\u2192 Corr(C \u2217 C; Ql,X , Ql,X )\n\u25e6 : Corr(C; Ql,X , Ql,X ) \u2297 Corr(C; Ql,X , Ql,X ) \u2212\u2212X\n\u03bc\u2217\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nCorr(C; Ql,X , Ql,X ).\n\nThis multiplication is associative by Lem. A.3.2 and the assumption that \u03bc is\nassociative. Therefore Corr(C; Ql,X , Ql,X ) acquires a (non-unital) algebra structure. Restricting to CU , the vector space Corr(CU ; Ql,XU , Ql,XU ) also acquires a\n(non-unital) algebra structure.\nA.6.1. Remark. We have a map\nEndS (X) \u2192 Corr(X \u00d7S X; Ql,X , Ql,X )\nwhich sends a morphism \u03c6 : X \u2192 X to the fundamental class of its graph. By\nExample A.5.3, this is an anti-homomorphism of monoids. Here the monoid structures are given by the composition of morphisms on the LHS and the convolution\n\u25e6 on the RHS.\nA.6.2. Proposition.\n(1) The map\n(A.12)\n\n(\u2212)# : Corr(C; Ql,X , Ql,X ) \u2192 EndS (f\u2217 Ql,X )\n\nis an algebra homomorphism.\n(2) The map (A.12) factors through the restriction map\nj \u2217 : Corr(C; Ql,X , Ql,X ) \u2192 Corr(CU ; Ql,XU , Ql,XU )\nso that we also have an algebra homomorphism\n(A.13)\n\n\u2212\n(\u2212)U,# : H0 (CU , D\u2190\nc ) \u2192 EndS (f\u2217 Ql,X ).\n\nProof. (1) follows from Lem. A.3.1; (2) The factorization follows from Lem. A.5.2.\nUsing the identification Ql,X \u223c\n= DX [\u22122d](\u2212d), we can identify j \u2217 with the restriction map\nBM\nHBM\n2d (C)(\u2212d) \u2192 H2d (CU )(\u2212d),\n\nwhich is obviously surjective. Therefore the map (A.13) is also an algebra homomorphism because the map (A.12) is.\n\u0003\n\n\fTOWARDS A GLOBAL SPRINGER THEORY I\n\n39\n\nReferences\n[BBD] A.Beilinson, J.Bernstein, P.Deligne, Faisceaux pervers, Analysis and topology on singular\nspaces, I (Luminy, 1981), 5\u2013171, Ast\u00e9risque, 100, Soc.
