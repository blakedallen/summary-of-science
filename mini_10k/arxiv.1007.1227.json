But how AGN are powered and how feedback operates are both poorly understood.\nAGN are thought to be powered primarily by the gravitational binding energy released from\naccretion onto nuclear, supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Much of the accretion energy is\nreleased promptly in the form of radiation and mechanical outflows. However, the accreted\nangular momentum can spin-up SMBHs (eg., Volonteri et al. 2005), storing rotational energy that may be tapped over longer timescales. Spin may therefore play an important role\nin the formation of extragalactic radio sources (Begelman, Blandford, & Rees 1984, Wilson\n& Colbert 1995).\nThere are good reasons to investigate spin-powered feedback in galaxies and clusters.\nFirst, the energy available in a spinning black hole is significant with respect to the thermal\nenergy of its X-ray atmosphere. A 109 M black hole spinning near its maximal rate stores\n62\n>\n\u223c 10 erg of energy which may be released in the form of mechanically-dominated jets. X-ray\nimages have shown that jet energy couples efficiently to hot atmospheres (B\u0131\u0302rzan et al. 2004,\nMerloni & Heinz 2008), which elevates the entropy (energy) of the hot gas and suppresses\ncooling and star formation in galactic bulges at late times (Voit & Donahue 2005). Second,\nin most spin models, the jetted outflow is coupled to the black hole's rotational energy\nthrough poloidal magnetic fields anchored to an accretion disk (Blandford & Znajek 1977,\nMeier 1999, Beckwith, et al. 2009, Krolik & Hawley 2010). These models generally require\nthe field to be confined by the accreting gas, placing an upper limit on the magnetic field\nstrength and hence the power that can be tapped from spin (i.e., \u1e40 \u221d Bp2 \u221d Pjet ). The\nconnection between jet power, spin, and accretion rate could in principle provide the physical\nbasis for a feedback loop (McNamara et al. 2009). Finally, systems with high jet power and\nlow fuel reserves may have difficulty powering their jets by accretion, making spin power an\nappealing alternative to accretion power.\nRadio jets are thought to form in radiatively inefficient accretion flows (e.g., RIAFs or\nADAFs) associated with hot, thick disks accreting far below the Eddington accretion rate\n(Rees et al. 1982, Narayan & Yi 1995, Narayan & Quataert 2005, Wu & Cao 2008). Several\nmodels have been proposed to power and collimate radio jets (Begelman, Blandford & Rees\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n1984), including the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism (Blandford and Znajek 1977, Ghosh\n& Abramowicz 1997) and its variants. The BZ mechanism derives power from a spinning\nblack hole through torques applied by magnetic field lines threading the ergosphere and\ninner region of the accretion flow. Field lines wind up along the hole's spin axis creating a\ncollimated outflow in the form of a jet. Variants of the BZ model, so-called hybrid models,\nare able to boost the power output per gram of accreted mass through the amplification of\nmagnetic flux in the plunge region of the black hole (Reynolds et al. 2006, Garofalo, Evans,\n& Sambruna 2010), and through frame-dragging (Meier 2001).\nIn this paper, we evaluate the roles of spin and accretion in generating powerful AGN\noutbursts in the cores of clusters. Because current jet models require a substantial level\nof accretion in order to extract spin power (Nemmen et al. 2007, Cao & Rawlings 2004),\nwe assume at the outset that all systems are ADAFs accreting at the same fraction of the\nEddington accretion rate, and we then critique this assumption. Our analysis differs from\nother analyses in that we do not rely on radio synchrotron power as a measure of jet power\n(e.g., Cao & Rawlings 2004). Instead, we derive jet power from cluster X-ray cavities taken\nfrom the Rafferty et al. (2006) sample, which provide reliable mechanical power estimates\nthat can be compared directly to spin models. Black hole masses were estimated using\nR-band absolute magnitudes also taken from Rafferty et al. (2006), and folded through\nthe black hole mass versus bulge magnitude relation of Lauer et al. (2007). The objects\nconsidered here and their properties are listed in Table 1.\n\n2.\n\nPower from a Rotating Black Hole\n\nWe adopt the model of Nemmen et al. (2007) for relating jet power to the parameters of\naccreting black holes. Their model follows the hybrid model proposed by Meier (1999, 2001),\nwhich relies on the BZ mechanism in rapidly spinning black holes and the Blandford-Payne\nmodel (Blandford & Payne 1982) at lower spins. Under the BZ mechanism, magnetic field\nthreading the inner edge of the accretion disk and the ergosphere can tap the spin energy of\nthe black hole to power a jet. The available power is proportional to the square of the spin\nparameter, j. The power is small unless the spin parameter is close to its maximum value\nof unity. Under the Blandford-Payne mechanism, magnetic field threading the inner edge of\nthe disk taps the kinetic energy of disk material to drive the jet. This mechanism can power\njets even for j = 0, but the BZ mechanism can tap substantially greater jet powers from\nrapidly spinning black holes\nFor a given black hole mass and spin parameter, the jet power depends quadratically\non the poloidal magnetic field strength (magnetic pressure). Hybrid spin models (eg., Meier\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n2001, Nemmen et al. 2007, Benson & Babul 2009) are able to enhance jet power by including\nfield amplification from the rotation of the accretion disk, frame dragging, and so forth. The\npoloidal magnetic field strength is not an arbitrary parameter, but is instead determined by\nthe accretion rate through the disk and ergosphere such that BP2 \u221d \u1e40 (Meier 1999, 2001,\nNemmen et al. 2007). Observational estimates of the spin parameters of radio galaxies (eg.,\nCao & Rawlings 2004, Daly 2009) cannot be decoupled from the accretion rate, which is an\nissue we focus on here.\n\n3.\n\nAGN Cavity Power as a Measure of Spin Power\n\nIn Fig. 1 we plot jet power against the estimated black hole mass for the hosting BCGs.\nThe jet powers span the range 1042 erg s\u22121 to 1046.5 erg s\u22121 , and the black hole masses lie\nbetween \u223c 108.5 M and 1010 M . Four objects with dynamically determined black hole\nmasses are highlighted in blue. All fall within the range of black hole masses estimated from\nbulge luminosities.\nThe total energy associated with a maximally spinning, 109 M black hole corresponds\nto \u223c 1062 erg. Its potential power output is Prot \u2248 1044\u219247 erg s\u22121 for spin-down timescales\nof 1010\u21927 yr (Martini 2004). The power output, assuming a spin-down period of 108 yr, is\nshown as the upper solid line labeled \"Pure Rotation\" in Fig. 1. The line lies well above the\nobservations demonstrating that spin is a potentially important power source.\nLacking measurements of their true accretion rates, we assume initially that all systems\nare accreting at the same rate \u1e41 in units of the Eddington limit, and we evaluate their spin\nparameters, j, using the Nemmen et al. (2007) model. Here the Eddington accretion rate\nis of the form \u1e40Edd = 2.2\u000f\u22121 MBH,9 M yr\u22121 , where \u000f = 0.1 and black hole mass is given\nin units of 109 M . We further assume a viscosity parameter \u03b1 = 0.2, which is within the\napproximate range expected in a turbulent accretion flow (see Meier 2001, Nemmen et al.\n2007). Varying \u03b1 between 0.04 \u2212 0.3 in Nemmen's model does not change our conclusions\nsignificantly.\nThe solid line labeled \"j = 1\" in Fig. 1 shows the calculated jet power from maximally\nspinning holes as a function of mass. The parallel broken lines show jet power calculated for\nlower spin parameters. In order to account for the high jet powers of MS0735 and Hercules\nA, the accretion rate must be \u1e41 = 0.02 or larger. We therefore have adopted this accretion\nrate in Fig. 1. Taken at face value, the data are consistent with spin parameters lying in\nthe broad range between 0.01 . j . 1, and with a median value of ' 0.6. However, due to\nthe number of unknown variables, we are unable to place interesting constraints on the spin\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nparameters of individual objects.\nThe assumption of constant \u1e41 implies a physical mass accretion rate \u1e40 that increases\nin proportion to black hole mass. With a black hole mass of about 6.4 \u00d7 109 M (Gebhardt\n& Thomas 2009), M87 would then be accreting at \u1e40 \u223c 2.8 M yr\u22121 . Accretion at this rate\nwould deplete its molecular gas reservoir in 3\u00d7106 yr, which is inconsistent with the age of its\ncurrent AGN outburst 7 \u00d7 107 yr (Forman et al. 2007). Moreover, the gravitational binding\nenergy released would dramatically exceed the observed mechanical power and radiation\nemerging from the nucleus, unless the binding energy is being advected into the SMBH.\nOther systems suffer similar problems although their constraints are not as tight. For these\nreasons, the assumption that all systems are accreting at or near \u1e41 = 0.02 seems to be\nunrealistic.\nThe distribution in Fig. 1 is equally consistent with all systems harboring SMBHs with\nhigh spin parameters but with broadly varying accretion rates, or with both the accretion\nrate and spin varying widely. We cannot distinguish between these possibilities, except\nperhaps in the most powerful systems.\n\n3.1.\n\nA Constraint on \u1e41crit\n\nWhether AGN release their energy in the form of radiation from a disk or in a jetted\noutflow is thought to depend on the the mass of the black hole and its accretion rate.\nWhen the accretion rate approaches the Eddington limit, AGN power emerges primarily as\nradiation from an optically thick, geometrically thin disk. When the accretion rate falls below\na critical value in Eddington units, AGN power emerges in a jetted (radio) outflow (Narayan\n& McClintock 2008). Observations of Galactic X-ray binaries suggest \u1e41crit \u223c 10\u22122 to 10\u22121\n(Gallo, Fender, & Pooley 2003, Falcke, H., K\u00f6rding, E., & Markoff, S. 2004, Churazov\net al. 2005), but its precise value is unknown. The objects in Fig. 1 are strong radio\nsources, yet they show little evidence for strong, unresolved nuclear ultraviolet emission that\nis characteristic of accretion near the Eddington rate. The accretion rates in Eddington units\nrequired to power their AGN are typically 10\u22124 and below, which is consistent with their\nbeing RIAFs or ADAFs.\nMS0735 and Hercules A, with jet powers exceeding 1046 erg s\u22121 , have the highest AGN\npower in our sample and are among the most powerful AGN known. Yet, despite their\nquasar-like powers, neither system shows nuclear activity, such as bright optical and UV\nemission, that is normally associated with quasars (McNamara et al. 2009, Nulsen et al.\n2005). Therefore, their AGN are unlikely to be accreting near the Eddington rate. However,\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nthe interesting combination of extraordinarily high AGN power combined with such feeble\nnuclear luminosities suggest that their current accretion rates lie close to but below \u1e41crit\n(but see Sternberg & Soker 2009 for a different point of view). For j ' 1, the jet powers of\nMS0735 and Hercules A would imply \u1e41 ' \u1e41crit ' 0.02, which is consistent with theoretical\nand observational estimates of \u1e41crit from X-ray binaries (Narayan & McClintock 2008, Gallo,\nFender, & Pooley 2003, Falcke, H., K\u00f6rding, E., & Markoff, S. 2004). This value of \u1e41crit\ncorresponds to physical accretion rates of roughly 2.2 M yr\u22121 and 1.1 M yr\u22121 , respectively.\nSlightly larger values of \u1e41crit are found by assuming their AGN are powered by accretion\nonto a Schwarzschild black hole (Churazov et al. 2005). In order to maintain MS0735's jet\npower while easing back on MS0735's spin parameter would require boosting its accretion\nrate to a level that is alarmingly high relative to its gas supply (see McNamara et al. 2009).\nThus, \u1e41crit implied by these systems cannot be much larger. Alternatively, higher jet power\ncan be achieved with a lower spin parameter, if their SMBHs are considerably more massive\nthan the MBH \u2212 Lbulge relation predicts (see Lauer et al. 2007 and McNamara et al. 2009\nfor discussions). Apart from these caveats, our analysis implies that the transition from low\nto high radiative efficiency occurs at accretion rates of no less than a few percent.\n\n4.\n\nBondi Accretion\n\nIgnoring spin power for the moment, the accretion rate required to power the AGN in\nour sample assuming Pjet = \u000f\u1e40 c2 is shown on the right hand side of Fig. 1. The value of \u000f in\nany given system is poorly known and can vary between 0.06 and 0.42 depending on whether\nwe are dealing with respectively, a non-rotating black hole or a maximally-spinning black\nhole. Given this uncertainty, we have adopted \u000f = 0.1 for all objects, which has become\nstandard practice in the field. The accretion rates vary from \u1e40 ' 10\u22124 M yr\u22121 in the gE\ngalaxy M84 to several M yr\u22121 in Hercules A and MS0735. The Bondi accretion rate from\n2\na hot atmosphere scales as \u1e40B \u221d ne (kT )\u22123/2 MBH\n, where ne and T are, respectively, the\nelectron density and gas temperature at the Bondi radius, and MBH is the black hole mass.\nBondi accretion can be effective only when the hot atmosphere is sufficiently dense near the\nBondi radius to feed the SMBH at a rate consistent with Pjet .\nIn Fig. 2 we plot the ratio of jet power to Bondi accretion power against estimated black\nhole mass. We assume P = \u03b7\u000f\u1e40 c2 where the efficiency of accretion through the Bondi sphere\nis \u03b7 = 1. In other words, all of the mass reaching the Bondi radius is assumed to be accreted\nonto the SMBH. Fig. 2 shows that with the exception of the lower power systems residing\nwithin or near the shaded region of the plot, Bondi accretion would have great difficulty\npowering cluster AGN outbursts. Rafferty et al. (2006), using the data presented here, and\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nHardcastle et al. (2007), using powerful radio galaxies, reached similar conclusions.\nFalling gas temperatures and rising gas densities near the (unresolved) Bondi radii,\nin addition to the possibility that the black hole masses may be larger than their bulge\nluminosities imply, would increase the number of objects lying within the shaded region in\nFig. 2 (see Rafferty et al. 2006 for a thorough discussion). However, this effect will be offset\nto a degree by the overly optimistic assumption that \u03b7 = 1. Mass lost to winds blowing\nfrom the accretion disk and the need to shed angular momentum from the accreting gas\n(eg., Neilsen & Lee 2009, Proga 2009, Soker et al. 2009) are expected to drive \u03b7 well below\nunity (Allen et al. 2006, Merloni & Heinz 2008, Benson & Babul 2009, Li & Cao 2010). For\nexample, Allen et al. (2006), Merloni & Heinz (2008) found that only a few percent of the\nmatter reaching the Bondi radius is actually converted into jet power, which is consistent\nwith \u03b7 < 1. Accretion at this level would be able power low luminosity AGN found in\nelliptical galaxies (Allen et al. 2006). However, it strengthens our conclusion that Bondi\naccretion from the hot atmosphere alone probably cannot fuel the most powerful AGN in\nclusters.\n\n5.\n\nCold Accretion\n\nIn Fig. 3 we plot total molecular gas mass against jet power for the objects with gas mass\nmeasurements available in the literature. The molecular gas masses generally lie between\n109 M to 1011 M . Only M87's upper limit of less than 8 \u00d7 106 M (Tan et al. 2008) lies\nsubstantially below this range. Gas masses were corrected to our adopted cosmology when\nnecessary; details of the gas mass analysis can be found in the references given in the caption\nto Fig. 3. The gas masses needed to fuel the AGN, Macc \u223c Ecav /0.1c2 = 106 M \u2212 109 M ,\nlie well within the observed range seen in Fig. 3. If these AGN are powered primarily by\naccretion of molecular gas, a correlation between the gas supply and jet power would be\nexpected. Spin models requiring high accretion rates would also predict a correlation. Yet\nno correlation is seen between molecular gas mass and jet power within the range of jet\npower shown in Fig. 3. The Spearman rank order correlation coefficients for the sample\nincluding and excluding upper limits are 0.35 and 0.60, respectively. These statistical figures\nof merit confirm the absence of an evident correlation in Fig. 3. In fact, for a given jet\npower the molecular gas reservoirs vary in mass by more than two orders of magnitude.\nFurthermore, the large gas supply relative to AGN power in most systems suggests that very\nlittle molecular gas is currently reaching the black hole.\nThe large scatter and absence of a correlation may be related to several factors. The\nmost important factor may be the presence or absence of star formation, which we discuss\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nfurther below. The high star formation rates in many of the objects in our sample suggests\nthat most of their molecular gas is being consumed by star formation (Rafferty et al. 2006,\nO'Dea et al. 2008). Some of the gas that is not consumed by star formation may be driven\naway from the nucleus by AGN (Sternberg & Soker 2009). In addition, temporal variations\nin accretion rate related perhaps to dynamical interactions with neighboring galaxies may\nalso be contributing to the scatter. Finally, because in most systems only a small fraction\nof the molecular gas mass is required to fuel the AGN, a real correlation may be obscured\nby these and other factors. Whatever the important factors may be, AGN power seems to\nbe largely decoupled from the total molecular gas supply.\n\n5.1.\n\nAccretion Efficiency per AGN Outburst\n\nAnother way to look at this problem is to evaluate the fraction of the gas mass that\nmust be consumed by the AGN in order to power it. As a point of reference, the average\nmass accretion efficiency of SMBHs implied by scaling relations between bulge and black\nhole mass is ' 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 (Magorrian et al. 1998, H\u00e4ring & Rix 2004). In other words, for\neach unit of mass that fell into nuclear black holes, roughly 700 units of mass formed stars.\nAssuming that most of the molecular gas in BCGs is consumed by star formation (O'Dea\net al. 2008), we can define the accretion efficiency per AGN outburst as Ejet /0.1Mmol c2 .\nUsing this definition, a plot of accretion efficiency versus molecular gas mass (Fig. 4) shows\na median value of approximately 6 \u00d7 10\u22124 , a value that lies below but is roughly consistent\nwith the fraction of gas that is expected to be consumed by the black hole based on scaling\nrelations (H\u00e4ring & Rix 2004). However, the accretion efficiency at a given gas mass varies\nby more than three orders of magnitude. So it is unclear whether the similarity of these two\nfigures is more than a coincidence.\nThe extremes are represented by Abell 1068, a cluster with a burgeoning central galaxy\nhosting a relatively weak AGN, and MS0735, whose dormant, gas-poor BCG hosts an extraordinarily powerful AGN, but no appreciable star formation. Abell 1068's BGG contains\n\u223c 1011 M of molecular gas (Edge 2001) and is experiencing star formation at a rate of\n\u223c 60 M yr\u22121 (McNamara et al. 2004). The BCG has a weak radio AGN indicating a\ncurrent accretion efficiency below 10\u22125 . It is a strong far infrared source (Edge et al. 2010),\nsome of which may be associated with a buried AGN (Quillen et al. 2008). The energy being\nreleased in the infrared may indicate a somewhat higher accretion efficiency than its radio\npower indicates, but its mechanical energy clearly falls well below the sample mean.\nMost of the objects in this sample with molecular gas masses above a few 109 M are\nexperiencing star formation and thus bulge growth at some level. All of the objects with gas\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nmasses above 1010 M , located to the upper left of Fig. 4, are experiencing star formation\nabove several tens of solar masses per year (O'Dea 2008). By virtue of their AGN outbursts,\nall are experiencing black hole growth. Rafferty et al. (2006) found many cooling flow BCGs\ngrowing parallel to the slope of the black hole versus bulge mass scaling relations, which\nis complementary to our finding that the median accretion efficiency here lies close to the\nexpected value from black hole scaling relations. Abell 1068 is an outlier in the sense that its\nblack hole appears to be growing more slowly than expected for its current star formation\nrate.\nWith an accretion efficiency of approximately 10 per cent, MS0735 represents the opposite extreme. A search for molecular gas in MS0735 in the CO[1 \u2192 0] emission line by\nSalom\u00e8 & Combes (2008) revealed an upper limit of \u223c 1010 M . An HST image of the\nBCG has revealed weak nuclear dust features, and its star formation rate, based on both far\nultraviolet (McNamara et al. 2009) and mid infrared observations (Donahue et al. 2010, in\npreparation), lies below 0.25 M yr\u22121 . These properties taken together are consistent with\nother BCGs with gas reservoirs of order 109 M or less. The implication is that the ratio\nof MS0735's estimated molecular gas mass to its total jet power indicates that a substantial\nfraction of its existing gas supply must have been consumed by its SMBH in the past 108\nyr. If true, the gas must have efficiently shed its angular momentum and it must have done\nso without forming an appreciable number of stars, which would be difficult to understand\n(see McNamara et al. 2009 for a discussion). Hydra A, MKW3S, and Cygnus A are similar\nbut less extreme. In fact, these objects appear to congregate together at the high efficiency\nand relatively low gas mass quadrant to the lower right of Fig. 4. Given their relatively\nmodest gas masses, it is surprising that they they are among the most powerful AGN known\nin clusters.\nOca\u00f1a Flaquer et al. (2010) recently noted relatively modest molecular gas masses of a\nfew 108 M in powerful, nearby radio galaxies. In addition, Emonts et al. (2007) reported\nan anti-correlation between radio source size, a property that is related to jet power, and\nneutral hydrogen mass in giant elliptical galaxies. These results suggest that the trend we\nsee in BCGs may be related to a more general phenomenon of high jet powers associated\nwith relatively gas-poor host galaxies.\nBeing the most powerful FR II radio source in the nearby Universe, Cygnus A is worth\na brief discussion. An analysis of the shock front in the X-ray halo surrounding its radio\nlobes gives Mach number 1.4, total shock energy Es = 2 \u00d7 1060 erg, and a mean jet power of\n4\u00d71045 erg s\u22121 (Nulsen et al. 2010, in preparation). This power measurement is substantially\nless than that of Wilson et al. (2006), which treated the shock as very strong. Powering\nCygnus A by accretion would have consumed more than \u223c 107 M of gas over the past\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n1.6 \u00d7 107 yr. For comparison, Salome & Combes (2003) found less than 1.5 \u00d7 109 M of\nmolecular gas in its bulge, which is more than enough gas to feed the outburst. Nevertheless,\nits accretion efficiency, which exceeds 7 \u00d7 10\u22123 , indicates that it is fueling its AGN relatively\nefficiently (see Fig. 4.)\nThe outburst energies of Abell 1835 and Zw 3146, both of which are indicated in Fig.\n4, are comparable to that of Cygnus A. However, their accretion efficiencies are an order of\nmagnitude or so lower, placing them to the upper left in Fig. 4. Unlike Cygnus A, their\nbulges contain \u223c 1011 M of molecular gas and they are forming stars at rates approaching\n100 M yr\u22121 . Their locations in Fig. 4 imply that gas-rich systems with high star formation\nrates are unable to channel fuel onto the nucleus as efficiently as gas-poor systems. Star\nformation associate with gas stalled in circumnuclear disks may be inhibiting the flow of gas\nonto the AGN.\nAssuming all AGN in this sample are powered by accretion, the large variation in accretion efficiency with respect to gas mass seen in Fig. 4 must be contributing to the variation\nin jet power with respect to gas mass seen in Fig. 3. Some of the variation in accretion\nefficiency may be related to the value of the mass to energy conversion efficiency, \u000f, which\ndepends on the spin of the black hole. \u000f can vary by a factor of 7 depending on whether the\nblack hole is a non-rotating Schwarzschild black hole or a maximally spinning Kerr black\nhole. The scatter in Fig. 4 is much larger than this factor, so the spin of the black hole alone\ncannot account for it.\nIn light of this discussion, it is unclear whether spin powers all radio AGN or any AGN,\nfor that matter. Nevertheless, those systems with high (apparent) accretion efficiencies and\nsmall gas reservoirs that would have difficulty powering their AGN by accretion alone may\nbe the best candidates (see also Paggi et al. 2009 and Hart et al. 2009). The objects\nmeeting this criterion our sample: Cygnus A, Hydra A, MS0735, MKW3s, are located to\nright side of Fig. 4. If their current AGN outbursts are powered by accretion, then their black\nholes apparently consumed between one part in a few to one part in one hundred of their\nentire gas supply, possibly indicating a highly efficient mode of accretion. While it would be\ntempting to attribute powerful AGN residing in gas poor galaxies to spin, current BZ-based\nspin models (e.g., Nemmen et al. 2007, Benson & Babul 2009) also require relatively high\naccretion rates. Therefore, a mechanism that is able to tap spin power efficiently at relatively\nlow accretion rates, i.e., Pjet > \u1e40 c2 , may be needed to explain these systems, particularly\nthe AGN in MS0735. We note that existing BZ models still fail to make Pjet > \u1e40 c2 .\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n6.\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nWe have examined two possible scenarios for powering AGN in brightest cluster galaxies:\naccretion of cold molecular gas and black hole spin. Understanding how radio AGN are\npowered is central to many questions related to the evolution galaxies and black holes,\nincluding how AGN feedback operates at late times (eg., Croton et al. 2006, Somerville\net al. 2008). Although we are generally unable to distinguish between these two related\nscenarios, we find that AGN power in BCGs would be consistent with both a broad range of\nspin parameter and accretion rate. We find no significant correlation between jet power and\nmolecular gas mass in these systems. We have identified several powerful AGN associated\nwith BCGs that have surprisingly low gas reserves. Although accretion of cold gas must\nbe important at some level, this study shows that AGN power is poorly correlated with\nthe total molecular gas mass of the the host BCG. Molecular gas is clearly associated with\nstar formation (O'Dea et al. 2008), so perhaps most of the gas is being consumed by star\nformation before it is able to flow into the nucleus. Bondi accretion from hot atmospheres,\nwhich has become a staple in AGN feedback models, may be able to fuel weak AGN (Allen et\nal. 2006), but would have great difficulty supplying enough gas to power the most energetic\nAGN.\nIf radio AGN are powered instead by black hole spin, the observed distribution of jet\npower implies a broad range of spin parameter, given the spin model adopted here (Nemmen\net al. 2007). BZ-based models such as Nemmen's require substantial accretion rates in order\nto access spin power. So unfortunately it is impossible to place interesting constraints on\nthe spin parameter based on jet power alone. We have highlighted several powerful AGN\nresiding in relatively gas-poor bulges, which we suggest as good candidates for jet powering\nby black hole spin. However, they may have difficulty achieving their power output even\nwith spin parameters approaching unity, unless their spin is tapped with high efficiency, i.e.,\nPjet > M c2 (eg., Garofalo et al. 2010), or their black holes are more massive than expected.\nOur understanding of the accretion process in AGN will advance significantly in the\nfuture when ALMA becomes operational, and we are able to disentangle the molecular gas\nfueling star formation from the nuclear gas that will eventually plunge into the black hole.\nLikewise, future large aperture X-ray and optical/IR telescopes with sub arcsecond resolution\nare needed to explore the environments of AGN nearer to their Bondi spheroids.\nWe thank M. Ruszkowski, D. Evans, and A. Babul for enlightening conversations, and\nwe thank the referee for offering suggestions that improved the paper.
