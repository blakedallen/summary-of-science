This letter considers the interaction between\nsupernova remnants (SNRs) and molecular clouds (MCs), and studies its effect on the level of\ncosmic ray fluxes within star forming regions. The cosmic ray flux affects the ionization rate,\nwhich influences the formation of molecular cloud cores and the evolution of circumstellar\ndisks. Specifically, we explore how the cosmic ray production at the SNR/MC boundary\ninfluences the ionization fraction of the molecular gas. This ionization fraction controls the\nambipolar diffusion rate (and hence the rate of core formation) and the action of magnetorotational instabilities (MRI) in circumstellar disks (and hence the rate of disk accretion).\nA growing amount of data concerning the interactions of SNRs and MCs has been\nassembled. Huang & Thaddeus (1986) found that about half of SNRs in the outer galaxy\nare spatially coincident with large molecular cloud complexes. More recently, 1720 MHz\nOH maser emission, a signpost for SNR-MC interactions (Wardle & Yusef-Zadeh 2002), has\nbeen observed from nineteen galactic SNRs \u2013 roughly 10% of the sample (Yusef-Zadeh et\nal. 2003). The appearance of this maser emission is important in that it helps constrain the\ndensities and temperatures of post-shock gas in these environments. In addition, magnetic\nfield strengths and orientations can be deduced from Zeeman splitting and polarization\nstudies (Claussen et al. 1997; Brogan & Troland 2001). High resolution X-ray and CO data\nhave added to the list of interacting SNR/MC sources (Butt et al. 2001; Dubner et al. 2004;\nByun et al. 2006; Sasaki et al. 2006).\nShocks produced by the interaction of SNRs and MCs can transfer \u223c 10% of the SN\nexplosion energy into cosmic-rays (Dorfi 1999, 2000), and the interaction of these relativistic\nparticles with the ambient medium can lead to the production of pions and, subsequently,\nneutral pion-decay gamma-rays (Aharonian et al. 1994). Evidence for this hadronic process\nhas been found through the association of at least ten EGRET sources with SNRs expanding\ninto MCs (Esposito et al. 1996; Combi et al. 1999, 2001; Torres et al. 2003); five of these\nsources also belong to the aforementioned set of maser SNRs. While the EGRET SNRs have\ngamma-ray luminosities in the 30 MeV \u2013 10 GeV band ranging from L\u03b3 \u223c 1034 to 4 \u00d7 1036\nergs s\u22121 , they have not been detected at TeV energies (Rowell et al. 2000; Buckley et al.\n1997). This finding sets important constraints on the distribution of energetic particles in\nthese systems and corresponding constraints on particle-acceleration mechanisms in these\nhigh-density environments (Baring et al. 1999). These SNRs are also typically radio loud\n>\n10 Jy at 1 GHz), perhaps owing in part to synchrotron emission from secondary leptons\n(F \u223c\nproduced via the decay of charged pions (Fatuzzo & Melia 2003).\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nParticle acceleration in the SNR/MC environments can significantly enhance the cosmicray (CR) density above that of the local background \"sea\" surrounding these regions (Aharonian & Atoyan 1996, hereafter AA96; Torres et al. 2003). These energetic particles can\nincrease the ionization fractions within the molecular cloud, and thereby influence star formation. One important process in the formation of molecular cloud cores (stellar birth sites)\nis the removal of magnetic flux through ambipolar diffusion. The diffusion coefficient, and the\nrate, depends on the ionization fraction of the cloud material. As another example, an important mechanism for producing accretion in circumstellar disks is the magneto-rotational\ninstability (MRI) which depends on the ionization fraction in the disk. The enhanced cosmic\nray flux considered here produces a corresponding increase in the ionization fraction, which\nin turn affects the rates of these star formation processes.\n\n2.\n\nCOSMIC-RAY ENHANCEMENT IN SNR/MC ENVIRONMENTS\n\nThis section estimates the enhancement of cosmic rays in SNR/MC environments (see\nalso AA96). The EGRET SNRs have inferred gamma-ray luminosities spanning the range\nL\u03b3 \u223c 1034 to 4 \u00d7 1036 ergs s\u22121 . This large range in luminosities may be due in part to\nthe age distributions of the EGRET SNRs. If produced via a pion-decay mechanism, the\ngamma-ray luminosity initially increases as relativistic particles are continually injected into\nthe SNR/MC environment and their population builds up. The luminosity reaches a peak\nonce the acceleration mechanism is quenched (Sturner et al. 1996). Indeed, if 10% of the\nSN explosion energy is transferred to relativistic particles (Dorfi 1991, 2000), the gamma-ray\nluminosity of SNR/MC environments would peak at the value\n\u0013\n\u0010 n\n\u0011\u0010 \u03b7 \u0011\u0012 E\nH2\nCR\n36\n\u22121\nL\u03b3 \u223c \u03b7 (\u03c3pp np c) ECR \u2248 2.4 \u00d7 10 ergs s\n,\n(1)\n100 cm\u22123\n0.1\n1050 ergs\nwhere \u03c3pp = 40 mb is the pp scattering cross-section, \u03b7 is the fraction of a relativistic\nproton's energy that goes into the \u03c00 decay photon channel, ECR is the energy content of the\nrelativistic particles, and np and nH2 are, respectively, the proton and molecular hydrogen\nnumber densities (i.e., np = 2nH2 ).1 The value of \u03b7 can be estimated using the approximation\nfor the gamma-ray luminosity due to the decay of neutral pions\nZ\n2 \u039b0(\u03b1)\ndNCR (E\u03b3 )\n2 \u039b0(\u03b1)\nL\u03b3 \u2248\n(\u03c3pp np c) E\u03b3\ndE\u03b3 \u2248\n(\u03c3pp np c) ECR ,\n(2)\n\u03b1\ndE\n\u03b1\n1\n\nMolecular clouds are highly nonuniform, with densities on different scales ranging over several orders of\nmagnitude. However, the mean molecular hydrogen density of MCs is observed to be \u223c 102 cm\u22122\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nwhere \u03b1 is the spectral index of the distribution dNCR /dE of relativistic protons, and \u039b0 is\na dimensionless parameter that depends on \u03b1 (Crocker et al. 2005). The above equations\nimply \u03b7 = 2\u039b0 /\u03b1, so that \u03b7 = 0.18, 0.10, and 0.60 for \u03b1 = 2.0, 2.2, and 2.4, respectively. The\npopulations of relativistic protons injected into SNR/MC environments are expected to have\npower-law distributions with \u03b1 = 2 \u2013 2.4 (Jones & Ellison 1991), in good agreement with the\nEGRET observations. Since the diffusion rate depends on the energy of the particles, the\nspectrum of relativistic protons may flatten inside a MC so that \u2206\u03b1 \u2248 0.2 (Ballantyne et\nal. 2006). Since the ionization rate depends on the number density of particles (rather than\nthe energy density), this change in spectral index implies a corresponding change in number\ndensity (by a factor of \u223c 2), but the exact size of the change depends on the details of the\ndiffusion process. In future work, a careful assessment of this effect should be carried out.\nNext we assume that particles build up during an injection phase to their peak values on\na timescale of \u223c 104 years, consistent with estimates of the EGRET SNR ages. A fraction of\nthese particles will then diffuse into the cloud with which the SNR is interacting (where the\nfraction is determined by the solid angle subtended by the cloud). Diffusion continues until\nthe cosmic rays undergo pp scattering with the ambient medium, and thereby experience\ncatastrophic losses, on a time scale given by\n\u0010 n\n\u0011\u22121\nH2\n\u22121\n5\n\u03c4pp \u2261 (\u03ba\u03c3pp np c) \u2248 3 \u00d7 10 yrs\n,\n(3)\n102 cm\u22123\nwhere \u03ba \u2248 0.45 accounts for the inelasticity of pp interactions. Since protons only lose a fraction of their energy in a given scattering event, the total time of the cosmic ray enhancement\ncould be larger than \u03c4pp by a factor of 2 or 3. Setting the time scale \u03c4pp equal to the diffusion\ntime scale \u03c4dif \u2261 R2 /D(E), where D(E) is the energy-dependent diffusion coefficient, one\ncan estimate the distance R(E) that particles will diffuse into the cloud before scattering and\nlosing their energy. Adopting the expression D(E) = D10 (E/10 GeV)1/2 , where D10 = 1028\ncm2 s\u22121 (AA96), we find\n\u00131/2\n\u00131/2 \u0012\nq\n\u0011\u22121/2 \u0012\n\u0010 n\nD10\nE\nH2\nR(E) = \u03c4pp D(E) \u2248 100pc\n.\n(4)\n102 cm\u22123\n1028 cm2 s\u22121\n10 GeV\nAs noted in AA96, however, values of D10 \u223c 1026 cm2 s\u22121 may be more applicable in the\nmolecular cloud environment (Ormes et al. 1988), leading to an estimate of R(10 GeV) =\n10 pc. This length scale is comparable to the typical sizes of molecular clouds.\nThe energy loss rate for a cosmic-ray due to ionization is weakly dependent on energy for\nrelativistic protons, and is given by dE/dt \u223c 3.6 \u00d7 10\u22127 nH2 eV/s (Mannheim & Schlickeiser\n1994). The corresponding cooling time thus takes the form\n\u0013\u0010\n\u0012\nnH2 \u0011\u22121\nE\n6\n\u03c4ci \u2248 8.8 \u00d7 10 yrs\n,\n(5)\n10 GeV\n102 cm\u22123\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nwhich is considerably longer than the pp collision time for all but the least energetic protons.\nThe resulting energy density ucr within the MC during the SNR/MC interaction will be\nucr \u223c 500 eV cm\u22123 (ECR /1050 ergs) (R/10pc)\u22123 . This value is about 103 times larger than\nthe energy density of the local cosmic-rays (where ucr \u223c 0.5 eV cm\u22123 ). Thus, a significant\nenhancement of cosmic ray energy density can be achieved in molecular clouds through their\ninteractions with SNRs.\n\n3.\n\nENHANCEMENT OF THE IONIZATION FRACTION\n\nThe number density of ionized particles in a MC environment depends on the ionization\nrate (due to cosmic-rays) and a complex recombination process. For steady-state conditions,\nthe ionization fraction x \u2261 ne /nH2 is well approximated (Elmegreen 1979; Shu 1983, 1992)\nby the expression\n\u00011/2\n\u0001\u22121/2\nx \u223c 10\u22125 \u03b6/10\u221217 s\u22121\nn/102 cm\u22123\n.\n(6)\n\n<\nThis expression is valid for n \u223c\n106 cm\u22123 (\u03b6/10\u221217 s\u22121 ). Assuming that \u03b6 scales linearly with\nthe cosmic ray energy density, i.e., \u03b6 = 10\u221217 s\u22121 (ucr /0.5 eV cm\u22123 ), the ionization fraction\nin molecular clouds interacting with SNRs can be enhanced by up to a factor of \u223c 30. This\n<\n109 cm\u22123 for the enhanced cosmic ray flux considered here.\nscaling is strictly valid when n \u223c\nThe process of ambipolar diffusion occurs primarily at lower densities, and will be fully\naffected by this enhancement. In circumstellar disks, however, the densities are larger near\nthe disk midplane, and the full ionization enhancement might not be realized. Notice that\nthe ionization rate depends on the number density of cosmic rays, rather than the energy\ndensity. If the spectrum dNCR /dE is invariant, the two quantities scale together. However,\nthe index \u03b1 of the spectrum could vary (\u00a72), so that the scaling could differ by a factor of\n\u223c 4 (which affects the ionization fraction by a factor of 2).\n\nThe timescale \u03c4i required to reach this enhancement level can be estimated by setting\nthe ionization rate \u1e45e = \u03b6n equal to the ratio ne /\u03c4i . Using the expression for the ionization\nfraction x given by equation (6), this timescale estimate becomes \u03c4i = x/\u03b6 \u2248 3 \u00d7 104 yr\n(\u03b6/10\u221217 s\u22121 )\u22121/2 (n/102 cm\u22123 )\u22121/2 , only about 1000 yr when \u03b6 \u223c 10\u221214 s\u22121 . The ionization\nenhancement is thus established at virtually the same time as the CR enhancement. Of\ncourse, this result also means that the ionization enhancement will decay on a comparably\nshort timescale, as soon as the CR enhancement is removed due to pp scattering (up to 1\nMyr, as estimated in \u00a72; this time can be extended, as discussed below).\nThe discussion so far considers the MC environment to be uniform. However, these MC\nregions are highly nonuniform, exhibiting hierarchical structure that can be characterized in\nterms of dense clumps and cores surrounded by an interclump gas with n \u223c 5 \u2212 25 cm\u22123 .\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nClumps have characteristic densities n \u223c 103 cm\u22123 and radii r \u2248 0.1 \u2212 1 pc. These dense\nregions occupy a relatively small fraction (2 \u2013 8 %) of the cloud volume, but can account for\nmost of its mass (Williams et al. 1995). As a result, cosmic rays propagating through the\nMC environment spend most of their time in a lower density medium (nH2 \u223c 10 cm\u22123 ), so\nthe pp collision timescale would be \u223c 3 Myr. Of course, this point is somewhat diminished\nby the fact that these particles also spend a small fraction of their life (\u223c 2 \u2212 8%) in the\ndenser regions. If these particles can survive without undergoing pp scattering for \u223c 1 Myr,\nthe enhancement in cosmic ray energy density can last for a few Myr.\nThe interaction of relativistic protons with the MC medium leads to the production of\nboth neutral and charged pions, with each species produced in equal numbers. As a result,\npp scattering transfers roughly 3% of the initial cosmic-ray energy to secondary electrons\nand positrons \u2013 the byproducts of charged pion decays. The injection of these leptons can\nincrease the energy density of cosmic-rays above the field by as much as a factor of \u223c 30,\nand increases the ionization fraction by a factor of \u223c 5 (assuming that \u03b6 \u221d ucr ). The peak\nof the injected secondary lepton distribution occurs at \u223c 60 MeV. Near this peak energy,\nleptons traversing neutral atomic hydrogen cool predominantly via electronic excitation on a\ntimescale \u03c4c \u223c 7 \u00d7 104 (np /102 cm\u22123 )\u22121 yr (Gould 1975). The enhancement in the ionization\nfraction due to secondary leptons would therefore only last for a comparably short time.\n\n4.\n\nEFFECTS ON STAR FORMATION\n\nThe enhancement in cosmic ray flux, which increases ionization levels, can have a significant impact on star formation. Ionization affects the coupling between magnetic fields\nand the (largely neutral) gas. On scales of \u223c 0.1 pc, increased ionization leads to greater\ncoupling between gas and the magnetic fields, and acts to slow down star formation. On\nsmaller scales of \u223c 1 AU, increased ionization in circumstellar disks allows for MRI to remain\nactive over a greater extent of the disk and thereby allows for larger disk accretion rates.\n1/2\n\nIn considerations of ambipolar diffusion, the density of ions takes the form \u03c1i = C\u03c1n\nbecause the volumetric rate of recombinations is proportional to ne ni \u223c n2i and the volumetric\n\u221a\nrate of ionization is proportional to \u03b6nn (Shu 1992). As a result, the constant C \u221d \u03b6.\nStandard considerations of ambipolar diffusion (Mouschovias 1976; Shu 1983, 1992) show\nthat the effective diffusion constant is given by D \u223c vA2 /(\u03b3C\u03c1) \u221d \u03b6 \u22121/2 , where vA is the Alfv\u00e9n\nspeed and \u03b3 is the drag coefficient between ions and neutrals. As the cosmic ray flux increases,\nthe diffusion coefficient decreases as the square root of the flux. A 1000-fold increase in the\ncosmic ray flux (\u00a72) thus decreases the effective diffusion constant by a factor of \u223c 30,\nand increases the ambipolar diffusion time scale by the same factor. Current observations\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nindicate that the diffusion process is too slow to account for the observed statistics of starless\nmolecular cloud cores (e.g., Jijina et al. 1999), so that some mechanism to speed up the\nprocess is required, even in the absence of supernova enhancement of the cosmic ray flux\n(Ciolek & Basu 2001, Zweibel 2002, Fatuzzo & Adams 2002). The factor of \u223c 30 increase\nin timescale due to cosmic ray enhancement essentially shuts down the process. Although\nsupernovae have often been invoked as a means to trigger star formation (Elmegreen 1998),\nthis mechanism provides a channel for supernovae to inhibit star formation.\nAn enhancement in cosmic ray flux also influences disk accretion for star/disk systems\nassociated with the interaction region. A growing consensus in the field holds that disk\naccretion is produced by an effective viscosity that is driven by turbulence, which in turn\nis driven by MHD instabilities such as MRI (Balbus & Hawley 1991). In order for MRI to\noperate, and hence for disk accretion to take place, the ionization fraction must be sufficiently\nhigh so that the gas is well coupled to the field. The inner disk can be ionized by collisions\n(where the number density and temperature are high), and the outer disk can be ionized\nby standard values of the cosmic ray flux, but intermediate regions may have dead zones\nwhere ionization is too low (Gammie 1996). The enhanced cosmic ray flux acts to increase\nthe fraction of the disk that is active, i.e., sufficiently ionized for MRI to operate.\nTo illustrate the possible effects of an enhanced cosmic ray flux, consider the disk models\nof Gammie (1996), where the cosmic ray flux has its standard (unenhanced) value. The flux\nis assumed to be ineffective as an ionization source after it falls to 1/e times its initial value.\nThe attenuation column density for cosmic ray ionization is \u03a30 \u2248 100 g/cm2 (Umebayashi &\nNakano 1981). As a result, only the uppermost 100 g/cm2 of the disk (and a corresponding\nlayer on the other side) experience enough cosmic ray ionization for MRI to operate. With a\ncosmic ray flux that is enhanced by a factor F , the disk will experience cosmic ray ionization\ndown to a larger column density \u03a3\u2217 \u2248 (1+ln F )\u03a30 . For an optimal enhancement of F \u2248 1000,\nthe active column density becomes \u03a3\u2217 \u2248 8\u03a30 \u2248 800 g/cm2 (\u223c 8 times more disk material\ncan be ionized). To put this result in perspective, consider a circumstellar disk with mass\nMd = 0.05M\u2299 , radius rd = 30 AU, and surface density profile \u03a3 \u221d 1/r. The total surface\ndensity at 1 AU is thus \u03a3 (1 AU) \u2248 2400 g/cm2 . Since the upper and lower 800 g/cm2\nof the column can be ionized with an enhanced cosmic ray flux, about 2/3 of the disk can\nremain active at r = 1 AU. As a result, the dead zone subtends only the central 33% of\nthe disk column density, compared with 92% for no cosmic ray enhancement. Since both\nthe disk properties and the cosmic ray flux enhancement will vary from system to system,\nan extensive exploration of parameter space is warranted. Nonetheless, this calculation\nillustrates that supernova enhancements of the cosmic ray flux can have a substantial impact\non disk accretion. In the most extreme case, the disk accretion rate can be an order of\nmagnitude larger than in regions with no cosmic ray enhancement.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n5.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThis letter has shown that a supernova interacting with a molecular cloud can produce\na substantial enhancement in the flux of cosmic rays within the cloud. These cosmic rays can\ndiffuse a distance R \u223c 10 pc into the molecular cloud before undergoing pp scattering leading\nto catastrophic energy losses. The resulting flux enhancement is estimated to be a factor of\n\u223c 103 (R/10 pc)\u22123 within the diffusion region, and can last for a few Myr after cosmic-ray\nacceleration ceases. The corresponding enhancement in the ionization fraction within the\nmolecular cloud is estimated to be \u223c 30(R/10 pc)\u22123/2 . This cosmic-ray enhancement may\nhave a significant impact on star formation processes, primarily by affecting the ionization\nfraction. The enhanced ionization fraction in MC cores, the sites of protostellar collapse,\nincreases the ambipolar diffusion time scale by a factor of \u223c 30, so that supernovae inhibit\nfurther star formation via this mechanism. The enhanced cosmic ray flux also increases the\nionization levels within circumstellar disks. In this setting, more of the disk can actively\nsupport MRI, so that supernovae enhancement of cosmic ray flux leads to increased rates of\ndisk accretion, by a factor of \u223c8.\nDuring the past decade, multiwavelength observations have provided important clues\nabout cosmic ray acceleration resulting from the interaction between supernova remnants\nand molecular clouds. While OH maser emission has helped constrain the environment\nof the acceleration sites, EGRET observations have helped constrain the resulting particle\ndistributions. Additionally, since the gamma-ray emission above \u223c 100 MeV is believed to\nresult primarily from the decay of neutral pions produced by the scattering of the cosmic rays\nwith the ambient medium, future GLAST observations promise to advance our understanding\nof how cosmic rays diffuse from their acceleration sites and interact with the molecular cloud\nenvironment. Along with these future observations, additional theoretical work should be\ncarried out to explore the details of the diffusion of cosmic rays into molecular clouds, the\nenhanced ionization fractions produced therein, and the subsequent effects on star formation.\n\nThis work was supported by Xavier University through the Hauck Foundation.
