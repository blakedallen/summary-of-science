Introduction\nPowerful radio galaxies play a critical role in our understanding of both galaxy evolution and the phenomenon of activity in\ngalactic nuclei. Yet we know little about how the radio galaxies\nare born and how they subsequently evolve. Recent work has\nidentified the GHz Peaked Spectrum (GPS) and Compact Steep\nSend offprint requests to: A. Labiano\n\nSpectrum (CSS) radio sources as the most likely candidates\nfor the progenitors of the large scale powerful classical double\n(FR2) sources (e.g. O'Dea et al. 1991; Fanti et al. 1990, 1995;\nReadhead et al. 1996b,a; O'Dea & Baum 1997); for a review\nsee O'Dea (1998). The GPS and CSS sources are powerful\nbut compact radio sources whose spectra are generally simple\nand convex with peaks near 1 GHz and 100 MHz respectively.\nThe GPS sources are contained within the extent of the optical\n\n\f2\n\nA. Labiano et al.: HST/STIS spectroscopy of CSS sources\n\nnarrow emission line region (<\n\u223c 1 kpc) while the CSS sources\nare contained within the host galaxy (<\n\u223c 15 kpc).\nCurrent models for the evolution of powerful radio galaxies\nsuggest that these sources propagate from the \u223c 10 pc to Mpc\nscales at roughly constant velocity through an ambient medium\nwhich declines in density as \u03c1(R) \u221d R\u22122 while the sources\ndecline in radio luminosity as Lrad \u221d R\u22120.5 (Fanti et al. 1995;\nBegelman 1996; Readhead et al. 1996a; De Young 1997;\nKaiser et al. 1997; Kaiser & Alexander 1997; Snellen et al.\n2000). Such a scenario is consistent with the observed number\ndensities of powerful radio sources as a function of linear size\n(from tens of parsecs to hundreds of kpc) (e.g. O'Dea & Baum\n1997; Fanti et al. 2001) . However, the situation must be more\ncomplicated than this simple picture. We give two reasons:\n(1) The GPS and CSS sources must interact with the host\ngalaxy as they propagate through it. The discovery of emission\nline gas aligned with and presumably co-spatial with the\nCSS radio sources and the presence of broad and complex\nintegrated emission line profiles (Gelderman & Whittle 1994)\nindicates that the radio source is strongly interacting with the\nambient gas (de Vries et al. 1997, 1999; Axon et al. 2000).\nTherefore, we would expect shocks to contribute strongly to\nthe ionization of the gas (e.g. Bicknell et al. 1997). (2) The\nGPS sources are observed to have expansion velocities several\ntimes higher (Conway 1998, private communication) than\nthe estimated advance speeds of large scale classical doubles\n(Alexander & Leahy 1987). This would require the evolving\nGPS sources to decelerate as they propagate though the host\ngalaxy and would require the radio sources to dim faster than\nthe simple models predict. It may be that the deceleration takes\nplace via interaction with ambient gas (see De Young 1993;\nCarvalho 1994, 1998).\nWe are carrying out a study of the kinematics and ionization of the aligned emission line nebulae in three CSS\nradio sources: 3C 67 (galaxy, z = 0.310, linear size D=10.1\nKpc), 3C 277.1 (quasar, z = 0.321, D=6.9 Kpc), 3C 303.1\n(galaxy, z = 0.267, D=6.2 Kpc)1 with HST/STIS long-slit\nspectroscopy. In O'Dea et al. (2002) we presented our results\non the kinematics of the [O \uf769\uf769\uf769] \u03bb5007 emission line and found\ncomplex emission line profiles and large differences in velocity\noffset on the two sides of the nucleus, suggesting that the\ncloud motions are being driven by shocks induced by the\nexpanding radio lobes. In O'Dea et al. (2003) we discussed\ntwo models for the cloud kinematics - (1) acceleration by the\nradio source bow shock and (2) acceleration by the post bow\nshock wind, and concluded that the bow shock acceleration\nwas favored. Here we present the results of our low dispersion\nspectra of several diagnostic emission lines. We compare our\nresults with shock and photo-ionization models and examine\nthe relationships between the ionization diagnostics and the\ngas kinematics.\n\n1\nWe adopt a Hubble constant of Ho = 75 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 and a\ndeceleration parameter of qo = 0.0.\n\n2. Observations\nWe obtained STIS long slit spectra through the 52\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 0.1.\u2032\u2032\nslit through several gratings. The instrumental parameters are\nsummarized in Table 1. The observations through the medium\ndispersion G750M grism has been used primarily to study the\nkinematics of the nebula and are discussed by O'Dea et al.\n(2002). For the study of the ionization, we observed through\nthe low dispersion G750L (5236 to 10266\u00c5) and G430L (2900\nto 5700\u00c5) grisms centered on 7751\u00c5 and 4300\u00c5, respectively,\nwith a spectral resolution of 5\u00c5/pixel and a Line Spread\nFunction (LSF) of 2.0 pixels resulting in a velocity resolution\nof \u223c 700 km/s at the center of the blue side of the spectra and\n\u223c 390 km/s at the center of the red side2 . The spatial resolution\nis given by the Point Spread Function (PSF) of the detector,\nwith a FWHM of 2.3 pixels.\nWe integrated for one orbit on each slit position (\u223c\n2500\u20133000 sec) with the orientation taken roughly parallel\nto the radio source axis. In each source one slit was centered\non the source nucleus and aligned along the radio axis. In\n3C 67 and 3C 303.1, where the emission line gas is slightly\nmisaligned with respect to the radio axis, we rotated the slit\nto place it along the emission-line nebula axis, rather than the\nradio source axis.\n\n3. Data reduction\nThe standard STIS reduction pipeline was used to remove\ndetector signatures such as bias, dark current, and flat fielding\nand to apply the flux calibration. Cosmic ray hits can be\nquite numerous over the course of orbit-long exposures. We\ntherefore split each exposure per orbit into two equal-length\nparts in order to allow removal of cosmic rays. Any surviving\ncosmic rays were removed and replaced by the average of the\nflux values in the adjacent pixels around the cosmic ray.\nTo correct the spatial dispersion of the light produced\nby the spectrograph (given by the PSF) we have averaged\n(weighted by the flux errors given by the spectrograph)\nthree pixels in the spatial direction for every source. We also\naveraged all the rows in each lobe for each source, to produce\nan average lobe spectrum for each side of the source.\nWe used the IRAF/STSDAS Specfit (Kriss 1994) software\nto fit Gaussians to the profile of each emission line in our\nsources (Table 2 and Figures 1,2 and 3) measuring each line's\nintegrated flux, full width at half maximum (FWHM) and\ncentral wavelength (i.e., velocity offset relative to the nucleus).\nSome constraints were adopted to reduce the number of free\nparameters and limit our options to \"physically consistent\nmodels\", as follows: We classified the detected lines in the\nspectrum as either high or low ionization (see Table 2). We\nrequired all gas with same ionization state to have the same\nFWHM and velocity offset, and took as as free parameters the\nwidths and velocities of H\u03b2 and [O \uf769\uf769\uf769]\u03bb5007. The integrated\n2\n\nCorrected for redshift.\n\n\fA. Labiano et al.: HST/STIS spectroscopy of CSS sources\n\nfluxes of every line were free to vary except for those with\nknown ratios (from atomic physics, see e.g., Osterbrock 1989),\nin this case: the [N \uf769\uf769] \u03bb\u03bb 6548,84 and [O \uf769\uf769\uf769] \u03bb\u03bb 4959,5007\ndoublets. We used a power law to fit the continuum. Whenever\nthis model was not accurate enough in parts of the spectrum,\nwe limited the fit to the adjacent regions of each emission\nline, improving our continuum model and producing accurate\nfits for the line profiles. Only a few of the potential emission lines (Table 2) were detected in the extended nebulae\n(signal to noise ratio > 3) \u2013 the [O \uf769\uf769]\u03bb\u03bb 3727,29 doublet,\nH\u03b1, H\u03b2, [O \uf769\uf769\uf769] \u03bb\u03bb 4959,5007 and the [N \uf769\uf769] \u03bb\u03bb 6548,84 ,\n[S \uf769\uf769] \u03bb\u03bb 6716,31 doublets3. Upper limits were defined to\nbe three times the noise of the spectrum, multiplied by\nthe width of the line: 3\u00d7RMS\u00d7FWHM. We used the width\nwe measured in the resolved lines of the same ionization status.\nSpecfit is known to overestimate the errors for flux and\ncentral wavelength measurements in our data. To improve\nthe estimation of our error bars we created over one hundred\nartificial spectra consisting of a perfect Gaussian with known\nrandom white Gaussian noise added, which covered the\nparameter space of our data in signal to noise ratios and\nresolution. We created ten artificial spectra for each different\nsignal to noise ratio and ran Specfit on each spectrum. We\ncompared the Specfit derived errors with those expected based\non the parameters of the artificial spectra and estimated a\ncorrection to the Specfit errors. The final step in the data\nreduction was correcting the data for reddening, using the\nGalactic dereddening curve in Cardelli et al. (1989) and the\nmeasured Galactic extinction values of Schlegel et al. (1998).\nO'Dea et al. (2002) searched for the possible presence\nof faint, broad wings (& 1500 \u2212 2000 km/s) using the low\ndispersion data, that might have been undetected in the higher\ndispersion data. They found no strong evidence for broad,\nnon-Gaussian components substantially above \u223c 1500 km/s in\nany of these galaxies.\n\n4. Results\nWe have detected several lines in the extended nebulae of\nall three CSS sources \u2013 [O \uf769\uf769], [O \uf769\uf769\uf769], H\u03b2, H\u03b1, and [N \uf769\uf769]. We\nhave used these lines to determine the standard diagnostics\nof ionization and compared them to the predictions of shock\nand photo-ionization models. We have also compared the\nionization levels with the gas kinematics, as presented and\ndiscussed by O'Dea et al. (2002).\n\n4.1. Ionization diagnostics\nGiven our line detections we were able to construct one\nof the key diagnostic Baldwin-Philips-Terlevich (BPT) di3\n\nWe have detected the [S \uf769\uf769] \u03bb\u03bb 6716,31 emission in very few points\nof the sources and our low wavelength resolution does not allow us to\ndeblend the doublet components.\n\n3\n\nagrams (Baldwin et al. 1981; Veilleux & Osterbrock 1987;\nMoy & Rocca-Volmerange 2002), namely the [O \uf769\uf769]/[O \uf769\uf769\uf769] vs.\n[O \uf769\uf769\uf769]/H\u03b2 diagram (Figs. 4,5,6). Other potentially useful BPT\ndiagrams (e.g., [S \uf769\uf769]/H\u03b1 vs. [N \uf769\uf769] 6583/H\u03b1, [O \uf769\uf769]\u03bb\u03bb 3727+29/\n[O \uf769\uf769\uf769]5007vs. [N \uf769\uf769] 6583/H\u03b1, [O \uf769\uf769\uf769] 5007/H\u03b2 vs. [S \uf769\uf769]/H\u03b1,\netc.) were not possible given the limited number of detected\nlines. We have compared our results with the two main classes\nof ionization mechanisms: shock ionization using MAPPINGS\nIII ((Kewley et al. 2003 in prep.; Dopita & Sutherland 1996)\nand AGN photo-ionization using CLOUDY (Ferland et al.\n(1998)). The MAPPINGS shock code calculates the spectra\nfrom gas which has been directly ionized by the shock (pure\nshock models) and unshocked gas which has been ionized by\nthe radiation emitted by the hot shocked gas (pure precursor\nmodels). In our BPT diagrams (Figs. 4,5,6) we show the\npredicted line ratios calculated by MAPPINGS for both a pure\nprecursor and pure shock model, as well as linear combinations\nof these two (30%, 50%, 70% contribution to the emission\nline luminosity from shocks), including a range of magnetic\nfields (MAPPINGS's magnetic parameter from 0.5 to 10)\nand shock velocities from 100 to 1000 km/s. In addition we\ninclude the predicted line ratios calculated by CLOUDY for\na range of ionization parameter (Log U ranging from \u22122 to\n\u22123.8) and cloud density (Log n = 0,2,4). We note that \"real\"\nradio galaxies are probably more complicated than assumed in\nthe MAPPINGS and CLOUDY calculations and suggest that\nthe results be taken with caution.\nWe find that the data points tend to spread across the\ndiagrams (Figs. 4,5,6) covering about one dex in both dimensions. The nuclei lie to the lower right of the distribution\nof points (with the highest values of [O \uf769\uf769\uf769]/H\u03b2, and lowest\nvalues of [O \uf769\uf769]/[O \uf769\uf769\uf769]) consistent with the nuclei containing\nthe highest ionization gas. The data for the extended emission\nclearly indicate lower ionization than the nuclei. In addition\nthe data for the extended emission are at higher ionization\nthan the 100% shock models from MAPPINGS and are at\nlower ionization than the CLOUDY AGN photo-ionization\nmodels. In general the extended emission lines are consistent\nwith a mixture of shocked and photo-ionized gas. In 3C 67,\nthe data lie between the MAPPINGS models for a contribution\nto the observed luminosity from shocked gas ranging from\n0 to 50%. In 3C 303.1, the contribution to the luminosity\nfrom shocked gas is between 30 and 70%. In 3C 277.1,\nthe data scatter around the model for 100% contribution to\nthe luminosity from precursor gas. Thus, the contribution\nfrom shocks increases from 3C 277.1 to 3C 67 to 3C 303.1.\nThe sources tend to lie in the regions for moderate to high\nshock velocities (500 to +1000 km/s) and we do not obtain\nany useful constraints on magnetic field strengths in the\nMAPPINGS models. We note that these results are consistent\nwith previous work on CSS radio sources using ground based\ndata (Gelderman & Whittle 1994; Morganti et al. 1997). We\nalso used the observed H\u03b1/H\u03b2 ratios to test the hypothesis that\nthe low values of the [O \uf769\uf769]/[O \uf769\uf769\uf769] ratio are produced by large\namounts of redenning. However, the observed Balmer ratios\n(or even values 10% higher than observed) are not consistent\nwith significant redenning effects on the [O \uf769\uf769]/[O \uf769\uf769\uf769] ratio\n\n\f4\n\nA. Labiano et al.: HST/STIS spectroscopy of CSS sources\n\n(except possibly in the nucleus of 3C277.1).\n\n4.2. Can the central AGN power the emission line\nluminosity in the extended nebulae?\nWe compared the number of ionizing photons produced by\nthe nucleus of the source, with the number of photons needed\nto produce the observed emission line luminosity (see e.g.\nWilson et al. 1988; Baum & Heckman 1989; Axon et al. 2000;\nO'Dea et al. 2000). Assuming radiative recombination under\ncase B conditions, the number of ionizing photons NH\u03b2 needed\nto produce the observed H\u03b2 luminosity LH\u03b2 is:\nNH\u03b2 = 2.1 \u00d7 1012 LH\u03b2 photons s\u22121\nWe use the integrated [O \uf769\uf769\uf769]\u03bb5007 fluxes measured by\nGelderman & Whittle (1994) (see table 3) and scale using the typical ratio for the narrow line components\nin CSS sources (see also Gelderman & Whittle 1994):\nH\u03b2/[O iii] \u03bb5007 = 0.18 \u00b1 0.02.\nThe number of photons in the continuum, between frequencies \u03bd1 and \u03bd2 are given by:\nNNuc = 4\u03c0D2 S 0 (\u03b1h)\u22121 (\u03bd\u03b11 \u2212 \u03bd\u03b12 ) photons s\u22121\nwhere D is the luminosity distance, the flux density spectrum\nis given by F\u03bd = S 0 \u03bd\u2212\u03b1 (we adopt \u03b1=1) and h is Planck's\nconstant. We are only interested in the photons with enough\nenergy to ionize Hydrogen, so we choose \u03bd1 = 3.3x1015Hz\n(912\u00c5 or 13.6eV) and \u03bd2 = 4.8x1017Hz (17 keV). For our\nspectral index, \u03b1=1, higher frequencies do not add a significant\nnumber of photons. Note that this analysis is subject to\nthe caveat that the continuum emission may not be emitted\nisotropically, and the extended nebulae may see a different\nluminosity than we do (e.g. Penston et al. 1990)\nThe results are shown in Table 4. We find that the nucleus apparently produces enough ionizing photons to power\nthe emission line luminosity in 3C 277.1 and possibly 3C 67,\nbut not 3C 303.1. This is consistent with the results from our\nBPT diagrams.\n\n4.3. Diagnostic ratios vs. kinematics and distance\nHere we look for additional clues to the nature of the ionization\nand acceleration of the emission line gas. In shock models,\nthe ionization should be related to the gas kinematics (e.g.,\nClark et al. 1998), while if the ionization is dominated by AGN\nphotoionization, the ionization level and kinematics should be\nlargely independent.\nWe have studied the behavior of the diagnostic ratios\n[O \uf769\uf769\uf769] 5007/H\u03b2, [O \uf769\uf769] \u03bb\u03bb3727+29 / [O \uf769\uf769\uf769] \u03bb5007, [N \uf769\uf769] 6583/\nH\u03b1, [S \uf769\uf769]/H\u03b1 with distance to the nucleus of the source, and\nthe gas kinematics (velocity offset relative to the nucleus,\n\nand FWHM). The kinematic data have been taken from the\nmedium dispersion results (O'Dea et al. 2002) given their\nsuperior spectral resolution. The low dispersion data give\nconsistent results. The relationships are plotted in Figures 7 to\n8 and the results are summarized in Table 5. We have applied\na Spearman rank test to search for correlations and regard\ncorrelations with a significance \u226599% as real.\nThe three sources show a decrease in ionization with\ndistance from the nucleus (based on [O \uf769\uf769\uf769] 5007/H\u03b2,\n[O \uf769\uf769]\u03bb\u03bb 3727+29/[O \uf769\uf769\uf769]5007). This behavior (high ionization in the nucleus, low in the lobes) can be explained by (1)\nthe influence of the central engine in the inner regions, and a\nlow ionization source, like shocks, further out, and (2) dilution\nof photons from the nucleus with distance. The sources\nshow a weak trend for ionization to decrease with increasing\nFWHM and a strong trend for ionization to decrease with\nincreasing velocity offset. This relation between ionization\nlevel and the kinematics is consistent with shock ionization\nand acceleration of the gas (as suggested by O'Dea et al. 2002).\n\n4.4. Cloud properties\nWe have estimated the electron temperature using the\n[O \uf769\uf769\uf769]\u03bb4363/[O \uf769\uf769\uf769]\u03bb5007 diagnostic lines. Given our limited\nsignal-to-noise we derive an estimate of the e\u2212 temperature in\nthe nucleus of 3C277.1 of \u223c20,000K and obtain lower limits\n(>7,000K) for the rest of the sources. These temperatures\nare consistent with previous measurements of temperatures\nin the nucleus and extended emission-line regions of AGN\n(Clark et al. 1998; Wilson et al. 1997; Storchi-Bergmann et al.\n1996). Tadhunter et al. (1989) showed that the observed ratio\nO \uf769\uf769\uf769\u03bb4363/O \uf769\uf769\uf769\u03bb5007 implied for several extended emissionline regions electron temperatures ranging from 12800K to\n22000K, whereas photoionization models predict much lower\nvalues. They discussed several possible explanations for this\ndiscrepancy between the results and the models, including\nadditional heating sources such as cosmic rays or shocks, or\nmetal abundances lower than the solar values assumed in the\nmodels.\nIn 3C 277.1 we also found high H\u03b1/H\u03b2values for the\nnucleus (10.4 \u00b1 0.2) consistent with the measurements of\nCSS quasars by Baker & Hunstead (1995), who argued for\nvery dusty gas in these objects. On the other hand, 3C 67 and\n3C 303.1 show H\u03b1/H\u03b2 ratios of \u223c 3.1.\n\n5. Summary\nWe present Hubble Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph\nlong-slit spectroscopy of the aligned emission line nebulae in\nthree compact steep spectrum radio sources: 3C 67, 3C 277.1,\nand 3C 303.1. In previous papers we have reported evidence\nthat the kinematics of the gas is consistent with being driven\nby shocks from the expanding radio lobes. Here we present\nthe results of our low dispersion spectra of several diagnostic\n\n\fA. Labiano et al.: HST/STIS spectroscopy of CSS sources\n\nemission lines. We compare our results with shock and photoionization models and examine the relationships between the\nionization diagnostics and the gas kinematics.\nWe find that the ionization diagnostics are consistent with\na mix of shock and photo-ionization in the extended emission\nline gas. The data for the extended emission are at higher ionization than the 100% shock models from MAPPINGS and are\nat lower ionization than the CLOUDY AGN photo-ionization\nmodels. In general the extended emission lines are consistent\nwith a mixture of shocked and photo-ionized gas. In 3C 67,\nthe data lie between the MAPPINGS models for a contribution\nto the observed luminosity from shocked gas ranging from\n0 to 50%. In 3C 303.1, the contribution to the luminosity\nfrom shocked gas is between 30 and 70%. In 3C 277.1, the\ndata scatter around the model for 100% contribution to the\nluminosity from precursor gas. The sources tend to lie in the\nregions for moderate to high shock velocities (500 to 1000\nkm/s) and we do not obtain any useful constraints on magnetic\nfield strengths in the MAPPINGS models.\nThe three sources show a decrease in ionization with\ndistance from the nucleus (consistent with a decrease in\nphotoionization with distance) a weak trend for ionization\nto decrease with increasing FWHM and a strong trend for\nionization to decrease with increasing velocity offset (which is\nconsistent with shock ionization) .\nThese results are consistent with a picture in which the CSS\nsources interact with dense clouds as they propagate through\ntheir host galaxies, shocking the clouds thereby ionizing and\naccelerating them (as suggested by O'Dea et al. 2002).\nAcknowledgements.

(1998)) AGN photo-ionization models (dashed lines). For the shock models from MAPPINGS\nwe included both pure precursor and pure shock models, as\nwell as linear combinations of these two (30%, 50%, 70%\ncontribution to the emission line luminosity from shocks). The\nresults do not depend on magnetic field strength, and so for\nsimplicity we show models with B = 10. Shock velocity in\nthis models ranges from 100 to 1000 km/s and increases to\nthe right. For the CLOUDY AGN photoionization models we\ninclude a range of ionization parameter (Log U ranging from\n-1.8 to -3.8) and cloud density (Log n = 0,2,4).\n\nFig. 5.

The first column gives the species; the second column the rest-frame wavelength; the third column the ionization status. For wavelength and ionization references see Eracleous & Halpern (2004). For each source we\npresent the integrated flux (in 10\u221216 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 arcsec\u22122 ) for the detected lines in the nucleus (Nuc) and southern (S) or northern (N) lobes.\nNondetections are indicated by \"-\". For the lobes we have used the spatially averaged spectra. However, a line marked in the table as a non\ndetection in the averaged spectra might have been detected in a couple of very localized positions. We require 3\u03c3 for a detection.

The integrated emission line flux\nand width are from Gelderman & Whittle (1994). The spectral age is estimated by fitting a continuous injection model to the integrated radio\nspectrum and is taken from Murgia et al. (1999). The advance speed is estimated using 2 v = linear size / spectral age.\n\n\f10\n\nA. Labiano et al.: HST/STIS spectroscopy of CSS sources\n\nTable 5.
