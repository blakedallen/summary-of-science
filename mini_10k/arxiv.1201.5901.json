The results of our analysis are summarized in a singular bifurcation diagram.\n\n1\n1.1\n\nIntroduction\nFast-Slow Systems\n\nFast-slow systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) have the general\nform:\n\u01eb\u1e8b =\n\u1e8f\n\n=\n\ndx\n= f (x, y, \u01eb)\nd\u03c4\ndy\n= g(x, y, \u01eb)\nd\u03c4\n\n\u01eb\n\n(1)\n\nwhere x \u2208 Rm , y \u2208 Rn and 0 \u2264 \u01eb \u226a 1 represents the ratio of time scales. The\nfunctions f and g are assumed to be sufficiently smooth. In the singular limit\n\u01eb \u2192 0 the vector field (1) becomes a differential-algebraic equation. The algebraic constraint f = 0 defines the critical manifold C0 = {(x, y) \u2208 Rm \u00d7 Rn :\nf (x, y, 0) = 0}. Where Dx f (p) is nonsingular, the implicit function theorem\nimplies that there exists a map h(x) = y parametrizing C0 as a graph. This\nyields the implicitly defined vector field \u1e8f = g(h(y), y, 0) on C0 called the slow\n\n1\n\n\fflow.\nWe can change (1) to the fast time scale t = \u03c4 /\u01eb and let \u01eb \u2192 0 to obtain the\nsecond possible singular limit system\nx\u2032\n\n=\n\ny\u2032\n\n=\n\ndx\n= f (x, y, 0)\ndt\ndy\n=0\ndt\n\n(2)\n\nWe call the vector field (2) parametrized by the slow variables y the fast subsystem or the layer equations. The central idea of singular perturbation analysis\nis to use information about the fast subsystem and the slow flow to understand the full system (1). One of the main tools is Fenichel's Theorem (see\n[16, 17, 18, 19]). It states that for every \u01eb sufficiently small and C0 normally\nhyperbolic there exists a family of invariant manifolds C\u01eb for the flow (1). The\nmanifolds are at a distance O(\u01eb) from C0 and the flows on them converge to the\nslow flow on C0 as \u01eb \u2192 0. Points p \u2208 C0 where Dx f (p) is singular are referred\nto as fold points1 .\nBeyond Fenichel's Theorem many other techniques have been developed.\nMore detailed introductions and results can be found in [12, 34, 24] from a\ngeometric viewpoint. Asymptotic methods are developed in [42, 23] whereas\nideas from nonstandard analysis are introduced in [8]. While the theory is well\ndeveloped for two-dimensional fast-slow systems, higher-dimensional fast-slow\nsystems are an active area of current research. In the following we shall focus on\nthe FitzHugh-Nagumo equation viewed as a three-dimensional fast-slow system.\n\n1.2\n\nThe FitzHugh-Nagumo Equation\n\nThe FitzHugh-Nagumo equation is a simplification of the Hodgin-Huxley model\nfor an electric potential of a nerve axon [30]. The first version was developed\nby FitzHugh [20] and is a two-dimensional system of ODEs:\n\u01ebu\u0307 =\nv\u0307\n\n=\n\nv\u2212\n\nu3\n+u+p\n3\n\n(3)\n\n1\n\u2212 (v + \u03b3u \u2212 a)\ns\n\nA detailed summary of the bifurcations of (3) can be found in [44]. Nagumo et\nal. [43] studied a related equation that adds a diffusion term for the conduction\nprocess of action potentials along nerves:\n\u001a\nu\u03c4 = \u03b4uxx + fa (u) \u2212 w + p\n(4)\nw\u03c4 = \u01eb(u \u2212 \u03b3w)\n1 The projection of C onto the x coordinates may have more degenerate singularities than\n0\nfold singularities at some of these points.\n\n2\n\n\fwhere fa (u) = u(u \u2212 a)(1 \u2212 u) and p, \u03b3, \u03b4 and a are parameters. A good introduction to the derivation and problems associated with (4) can be found in\n[28]. Suppose we assume a traveling wave solution to (4) and set u(x, \u03c4 ) =\nu(x + s\u03c4 ) = u(t) and w(x, \u03c4 ) = w(x + s\u03c4 ) = w(t), where s represents the wave\nspeed. By the chain rule we get u\u03c4 = su\u2032 , uxx = u\u2032\u2032 and w\u03c4 = sw\u2032 . Set v = u\u2032\nand substitute into (4) to obtain the system:\nu\u2032\n\n= v\n1\nv\u2032 =\n(sv \u2212 fa (u) + w \u2212 p)\n(5)\n\u03b4\n\u01eb\n(u \u2212 \u03b3w)\nw\u2032 =\ns\nSystem (5) is the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation studied in this paper. Observe\nthat a homoclinic orbit of (5) corresponds to a traveling pulse solution of (4).\nThese solutions are of special importance in neuroscience [28] and have been\nanalyzed using several different methods. For example, it has been proved that\n(5) admits homoclinic orbits [29, 4] for small wave speeds (\"slow waves\") and\nlarge wave speeds (\"fast waves\"). Fast waves are stable [33] and slow waves are\nunstable [21]. It has been shown that double-pulse homoclinic orbits [15] are\npossible. If (5) has two equilibrium points and heteroclinic connections exist,\nbifurcation from a twisted double heteroclinic connection implies the existence\nof multi-pulse traveling front and back waves [6]. These results are based on the\nassumption of certain parameter ranges for which we refer to the original papers.\nGeometric singular perturbation theory has been used successfully to analyze\n(5). In [32] the fast pulse is constructed using the exchange lemma [35, 31, 3].\nThe exchange lemma has also been used to prove the existence of a codimension two connection between fast and slow waves in (s, \u01eb, a)-parameter space\n[38]. An extension of Fenichel's theorem and Melnikov's method can be employed to prove the existence of heteroclinic connections for parameter regimes\nof (5) with two fixed points [45]. The general theory of relaxation oscillations\nin fast-slow systems applies to (5) (see e.g. [42, 26]) as does - at least partially\n- the theory of canards (see e.g. [46, 9, 11, 39]).\nThe equations (5) have been analyzed numerically by Champneys, Kirk,\nKnobloch, Oldeman and Sneyd [5] using the numerical bifurcation software\nAUTO [13, 14]. They considered the following parameter values:\n1\n,\n\u03b4=5\n10\nWe shall fix those values to allow comparison of our results with theirs. Hence\nwe also write f1/10 (u) = f (u). Changing from the fast time t to the slow time\n\u03c4 and relabeling variables x1 = u, x2 = v and y = w we get:\n\u03b3 = 1,\n\n\u01eb\u1e8b1\n\n=\n\n\u01eb\u1e8b2\n\n=\n\n\u1e8f\n\n=\n\na=\n\nx2\n1\n1\n1\n(sx2 \u2212 x1 (x1 \u2212 1)( \u2212 x1 ) + y \u2212 p) = (sx2 \u2212 f (x1 ) + y \u2212 p)(6)\n5\n10\n5\n1\n(x1 \u2212 y)\ns\n3\n\n\fFrom now on we refer to (6) as \"the\" FitzHugh-Nagumo equation. Investigating\nbifurcations in the (p, s) parameter space one finds C-shaped curves of homoclinic orbits and a U-shaped curve of Hopf bifurcations; see Figure 1. Only\npart of the bifurcation diagram is shown in Figure 1. There is another curve of\nhomoclinic bifurcations on the right side of the U-shaped Hopf curve. Since (6)\nhas the symmetry\n\u0012\n\u0013\n11\n33\n11\n11\nx1 \u2192\n1\u2212\n\u2212p\n(7)\n\u2212 x1 , x2 \u2192\n\u2212 x2 , y \u2192 \u2212y, p \u2192\n15\n15\n15\n225\nwe shall examine only the left side of the U-curve. The homoclinic C-curve is\ndifficult to compute numerically by continuation methods using AUTO [13, 14]\nor MatCont [22]. The computations seem infeasible for small values of \u01eb \u2264 10\u22123 .\nFurthermore multi-pulse homoclinic orbits can exist very close to single pulse\nones and distinguishing between them must necessarily encounter problems with\nnumerical precision [5]. The Hopf curve and the bifurcations of limit cycles\nshown in Figure 1 have been computed using MatCont. The curve of homoclinic\nbifurcations has been computed by a new method to be described in Section 3.2.\n\n2.2\n\n2\n\n\u03b5=0.01\n\nHopf\n\n1.8\n\n1.6\n\nSNLC\ns\n\n1.4\n\n1.2\n\n1\n\nHom\n\n0.8\n\nGH\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n0\n\n0.05\n\np\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\nFigure 1: Bifurcation diagram of (6). Hopf bifurcations are shown in green,\nsaddle-node of limit cycles (SNLC) are shown in blue and GH indicates a generalized Hopf (or Bautin) bifurcation. The arrows indicate the side on which\nperiodic orbits are generated at the Hopf bifurcation. The red curve shows\n(possible) homoclinic orbits; in fact, homoclinic orbits only exist to the left of\nthe two black dots (see Section 3.2). Only part of the parameter space is shown\nbecause of the symmetry (7). The homoclinic curve has been thickened to indicate that multipulse homoclinic orbits exist very close to single pulse ones (see\n[15]).\nSince the bifurcation structure shown in Figure 1 was also observed for other\n4\n\n\fexcitable systems, Champneys et al. [5] introduced the term CU-system. Bifurcation analysis from the viewpoint of geometric singular perturbation theory has\nbeen carried out for examples with one fast and two slow variables [27, 2, 25, 41].\nSince the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation has one slow and two fast variables, the\nsituation is quite different and new techniques have to be developed. Our main\ngoal is to show that many features of the complicated 2-parameter bifurcation\ndiagram shown in Figure 1 can be derived with a combination of techniques from\nsingular perturbation theory, bifurcation theory and robust numerical methods.\nWe accurately locate where the system has canards and determine the orbit\nstructure of the homoclinic and periodic orbits associated to the C-shaped and\nU-shaped bifurcation curves, without computing the canards themselves. We\ndemonstrate that the basic CU-structure of the system can be computed with\nelementary methods that do not use continuation methods based on collocation.\nThe analysis of the slow and fast subsystems yields a \"singular bifurcation diagram\" to which the basic CU structure in Figure 1 converges as \u01eb \u2192 0.\nRemark: We have also investigated the termination mechanism of the Cshaped homoclinic curve described in [5]. Champneys et al. observed that the\nhomoclinic curve does not reach the U-shaped Hopf curve but turns around and\nfolds back close to itself. We compute accurate approximations of the homoclinic\norbits for smaller values \u01eb than seems possible with AUTO in this region. One\naspect of our analysis is a new algorithm for computing invariant slow manifolds\nof saddle type in the full system. This work will be described elsewhere.\n\n2\n\nThe Singular Limit\n\nThe first step in our analysis is to investigate the slow and fast subsystems\nseparately. Let \u01eb \u2192 0 in (6); this yields two algebraic constraints that define\nthe critical manifold:\n\u001b\n\u001a\n1\n3\nC0 = (x1 , x2 , y) \u2208 R : x2 = 0 y = x1 (x1 \u2212 1)( \u2212 x1 ) + p = c(x1 )\n10\nTherefore C0 is a cubic curve in the coordinate plane x2 = 0. The parameter p\nmoves the cubic up and down inside this plane. The critical points of the cubic\nare solutions of c\u2032 (x1 ) = 0 and are given by:\nx1,\u00b1 =\n\n\u221a \u0011\n1 \u0010\n11 \u00b1 91\n30\n\nor numerically: x1,+ \u2248 0.6846,\n\nx1,\u2212 \u2248 0.0487\n\nThe points x1,\u00b1 are fold points with |c\u2032\u2032 (x1,\u00b1 )| 6= 0 since C0 is a cubic polynomial\nwith distinct critical points. The fold points divide C0 into three segments\nCl = {x1 < x1,\u2212 }\u2229C0 ,\n\nCm = {x1,\u2212 \u2264 x1 \u2264 x1,+ }\u2229C0 ,\n\nCr = {x1,+ < x1 }\u2229C0\n\nWe denote the associated slow manifolds by Cl,\u01eb , Cm,\u01eb and Cr,\u01eb . There are\ntwo possibilities to obtain the slow flow. One way is to solve c(x1 ) = y for\n5\n\n\fx1 and substitute the result into the equation \u1e8f = 1s (x1 \u2212 y). Alternatively\ndifferentiating y = c(x1 ) implicitly with respect to \u03c4 yields \u1e8f = \u1e8b1 c\u2032 (x1 ) and\ntherefore\n1\n(x1 \u2212 y) = \u1e8b1 c\u2032 (x1 )\ns\n\n\u21d2\n\n\u1e8b1 =\n\n1\n(x1 \u2212 c(x1 ))\nsc\u2032 (x1 )\n\n(8)\n\nOne can view this as a projection of the slow flow, which is constrained to the\ncritical manifold in R3 , onto the x1 -axis. Observe that the slow flow is singular at the fold points. Direct computation shows that the fixed point problem\nx1 = c(x1 ) has only a single real solution. This implies that the critical manifold intersects the diagonal y = x1 only in a single point x\u22171 which is the unique\nequilibrium of the slow flow (8). Observe that q = (x\u22171 , 0, x\u22171 ) is also the unique\nequilibrium of the full system (6) and depends on p. Increasing p moves the\nequilibrium from left to right on the critical manifold. The easiest practical\nway to determine the direction of the slow flow on C0 is to look at the sign of\n(x1 \u2212 y). The situation is illustrated in Figure 2.\nSlow Flow in the plane x =0\n2\n\n0.4\n\ny=x\n\n1\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\neq. pt. q\n\ny\n\n0.1\n\nx1,+\n\n0\n\n\u22120.1\n\nx\n\n1,\u2212\n\n\u22120.2\n\nC\n\n\u22120.3\n\n\u22120.4\n\u22120.4\n\n0\n\n\u22120.2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\nx\n\n1\n\nFigure 2: Sketch of the slow flow on the critical manifold C0\n\n2.1\n\nThe Slow Flow\n\nWe are interested in the bifurcations of the slow flow depending on the parameter\np. The bifurcations occur when x\u22171 passes through the fold points. The values\nof p can simply be found by solving the equations c\u2032 (x1 ) = 0 and c(x1 ) \u2212 x1 = 0\nsimultaneously. The result is:\np\u2212 \u2248 0.0511\n\nand\n\np+ \u2248 0.5584\n\nwhere the subscripts indicate the fold point at which each equilibrium is located.\n\n6\n\n\fThe singular time-rescaling \u03c4\u0304 = sc\u2032 (x1 )/\u03c4 of the slow flow yields the desingularized slow flow\ndx1\nx1\n= x1 \u2212 c(x1 ) = x1 +\n(x1 \u2212 1) (10x1 \u2212 1) \u2212 p\nd\u03c4\u0304\n10\n\n(9)\n\nTime is reversed by this rescaling on Cl and Cr since s > 0 and c\u2032 (x1 ) is\nnegative on these branches. The desingularized slow flow (9) is smooth and has\nno bifurcations as p is varied.\n\n2.2\n\nThe Fast Subsystem\n\nThe key component of the fast-slow analysis for the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation\nis the two-dimensional fast subsystem\nx\u20321\nx\u20322\n\n= x2\n1\n1\n=\n(sx2 \u2212 x1 (x1 \u2212 1)( \u2212 x1 ) + y \u2212 p)\n5\n10\n\n(10)\n\nwhere p \u2265 0, s \u2265 0 are parameters and y is fixed. Since y and p have the same\neffect as bifurcation parameters we set p \u2212 y = p\u0304. We consider several fixed\ny-values and the effect of varying p (cf. Section 3.2) in each case. There are\neither one, two or three equilibrium points for (10). Equilibrium points satisfy\nx2 = 0 and lie on the critical manifold, i.e. we have to solve\n0 = x1 (x1 \u2212 1)(\n\n1\n\u2212 x1 ) + p\u0304\n10\n\n(11)\n\nfor x1 . We find that there are three equilibria for approximately p\u0304l = \u22120.1262 <\np\u0304 < 0.0024 = p\u0304r , two equilibria on the boundary of this p interval and one\nequilibrium otherwise. The Jacobian of (10) at an equilibrium is\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0\n1\n\u0001\nA(x1 ) =\n1\ns\n2\n50 1 \u2212 22x1 + 30x1\n5\n\nDirect calculation yields that for p 6\u2208 [p\u0304l , p\u0304r ] the single equilibrium is a saddle.\nIn the case of three equilibria, we have a source that lies between two saddles.\nNote that this also describes the stability of the three branches of the critical\nmanifold Cl , Cm and Cr . For s > 0 the matrix A is singular of rank 1 if and only\nif 30x21 \u2212 22x1 + 1 = 0 which occurs for the fold points x1,\u00b1 . Hence the equilibria of the fast subsystem undergo a fold (or saddle-node) bifurcation once they\napproach the fold points of the critical manifold. This happens for parameter\nvalues p\u0304l and p\u0304r . Note that by symmetry we can reduce to studying a single fold\npoint. In the limit s = 0 (corresponding to the case of a \"standing wave\") the\nsaddle-node bifurcation point becomes more degenerate with A(x1 ) nilpotent.\n\n7\n\n\fOur next goal is to investigate global bifurcations of (10); we start with\nhomoclinic orbits. For s = 0 it is easy to see that (10) is a Hamiltonian system:\nx\u20321\n\n=\n\nx\u20322\n\n=\n\n\u2202H\n= x2\n\u2202x2\n\u2202H\n1\n1\n\u2212\n= (\u2212x1 (x1 \u2212 1)( \u2212 x1 ) \u2212 p\u0304)\n\u2202x1\n5\n10\n\n(12)\n\nwith Hamiltonian function\nH(x1 , x2 ) =\n\n1 2 (x1 )2\n11(x1 )3\n(x1 )4\nx1 p\u0304\nx2 \u2212\n+\n\u2212\n+\n2\n100\n150\n20\n5\n\n(13)\n\nWe will use this Hamiltonian formulation later on to describe the geometry of\nhomoclinic orbits for slow wave speeds. Assume that p\u0304 is chosen so that (12)\nhas a homoclinic orbit x0 (t). We are interested in perturbations with s > 0\nand note that in this case the divergence of (10) is s. Hence the vector field\nis area expanding everywhere. The homoclinic orbit breaks for s > 0 and no\nperiodic orbits are created. Note that this scenario does not apply to the full\nthree-dimensional system as the equilibrium q has a pair of complex conjugate\neigenvalues so that a Shilnikov scenario can occur. This illustrates that the\nsingular limit can be used to help locate homoclinic orbits of the full system,\nbut that some characteristics of these orbits change in the singular limit.\nWe are interested next in finding curves in (p\u0304, s)-parameter space that represent heteroclinic connections of the fast subsystem. The main motivation is\nthe decomposition of trajectories in the full system into slow and fast segments.\nConcatenating fast heteroclinic segments and slow flow segments can yield homoclinic orbits of the full system [28, 4, 32, 38]. We describe a numerical strategy\nto detect heteroclinic connections in the fast subsystem and continue them in\nparameter space. Suppose that p\u0304 \u2208 (p\u0304l , p\u0304r ) so that (10) has three hyperbolic\nequilibrium points xl , xm and xr . We denote by W u (xl ) the unstable and by\nW s (xl ) the stable manifold of xl . The same notation is also used for xr and\ntangent spaces to W s (.) and W u (.) are denoted by T s (.) and T u (.). Recall that\nxm is a source and shall not be of interest to us for now. Define the cross section\n\u03a3 by\nxl + xr\n}.\n\u03a3 = {(x1 , x2 ) \u2208 R2 : x1 =\n2\nWe use forward integration of initial conditions in T u (xl ) and backward integration of initial conditions in T s (xr ) to obtain trajectories \u03b3 + and \u03b3 \u2212 respectively.\nWe calculate their intersection with \u03a3 and define\n\u03b3l (p\u0304, s) := \u03b3 + \u2229 \u03a3,\n\n\u03b3r (p\u0304, s) := \u03b3 \u2212 \u2229 \u03a3\n\nWe compute the functions \u03b3l and \u03b3r for different parameter values of (p\u0304, s)\nnumerically. Heteroclinic connections occur at zeros of the function\nh(p\u0304, s) := \u03b3l (p\u0304, s) \u2212 \u03b3r (p\u0304, s)\n8\n\n\fOnce we find a parameter pair (p\u03040 , s0 ) such that h(p\u03040 , s0 ) = 0, these parameters\ncan be continued along a curve of heteroclinic connections in (p\u0304, s) parameter\nspace by solving the root-finding problem h(p\u03040 + \u03b41 , s0 + \u03b42 ) = 0 for either \u03b41\nor \u03b42 fixed and small. We use this method later for different fixed values of y\nto compute heteroclinic connections in the fast subsystem in (p, s) parameter\nspace. The results of these computations are illustrated in Figure 3. There are\ntwo distinct branches in Figure 3. The branches are asymptotic to p\u0304l and p\u0304r\nand approximately form a \"V \". From Figure 3 we conjecture that there exists\na double heteroclinic orbit for p\u0304 \u2248 \u22120.0622.\n1.5\n\n1\n\ns\n0.5\n\nPSfrag replacements\n0\n\u22120.15\n\n\u22120.1\n\n\u22120.05\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\np\u0304\nFigure 3: Heteroclinic connections for equation (10) in parameter space.\nRemarks: If we fix p = 0 our initial change of variable becomes \u2212y = p\u0304 and\nour results for heteroclinic connections are for the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation\nwithout an applied current. In this situation it has been shown that the heteroclinic connections of the fast subsystem can be used to prove the existence of\nhomoclinic orbits to the unique saddle equilibrium (0, 0, 0) (cf. [32]). Note that\nthe existence of the heteroclinics in the fast subsystem was proved in a special\ncase analytically [1] but Figure 3 is - to the best of our knowledge - the first explicit computation of where fast subsystem heteroclinics are located. The paper\n[36] develops a method for finding heteroclinic connections by the same basic\napproach we used, i.e. defining a codimension one hyperplane H that separates\nequilibrium points.\nFigure 3 suggests that there exists a double heteroclinic connection for s = 0.\n2\nObserve that the Hamiltonian in our case is H(x1 , x2 ) = (x22 ) + V (x1 ) where\nthe function V (x1 ) is:\n(x1 )2\n11(x1 )3\n(x1 )4\npx1\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n5\n100\n150\n20\np\nThe solution curves of (12) are given by x2 = \u00b1 2(const. \u2212 V (x1 )). The\nstructure of the solution curves entails symmetry under reflection about the x1 axis. Suppose p\u0304 \u2208 [p\u0304l , p\u0304r ] and recall that we denoted the two saddle points of\n(10) by xl and xr and that their location depends on p\u0304. Therefore, we conclude\nV (x1 ) =\n\n9\n\n\fthat the two saddles xl and xr must have a heteroclinic connection if they lie\non the same energy level, i.e. they satisfy V (xl ) \u2212 V (xr ) = 0. This equation\ncan be solved numerically to very high accuracy.\nProposition 1. The fast subsystem of the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation for s =\n0 has a double heteroclinic connection for p\u0304 = p\u0304\u2217 \u2248 \u22120.0619259. Given a\nparticular value y = y0 there exists a double heteroclinic connection for p =\np\u0304\u2217 + y0 in the fast subsystem lying in the plane y = y0 .\n\n2.3\n\nTwo Slow Variables, One Fast Variable\n\nFrom continuation of periodic orbits in the full system - to be described in\nSection 3.1 - we observe that near the U-shaped curve of Hopf bifurcations the\nx2 -coordinate is a faster variable than x1 . In particular, the small periodic\norbits generated in the Hopf bifurcation lie almost in the plane x2 = 0. Hence\nto analyze this region we set x\u03042 = x2 /\u01eb to transform the FitzHugh-Nagumo\nequation (6) into a system with 2 slow and 1 fast variable:\n\u1e8b1\n\n=\n\n\u01eb2 x\u0304 \u0307 2\n\n=\n\n\u1e8f\n\n=\n\nx\u03042\n1\n1\n(s\u01ebx\u03042 \u2212 x1 (x1 \u2212 1)( \u2212 x1 ) + y \u2212 p)\n5\n10\n1\n(x1 \u2212 y)\ns\n\n(14)\n\nNote that (14) corresponds to the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation in the form (cf.\n(4)):\n\u001a\nu\u03c4 = 5\u01eb2 uxx + f (u) \u2212 w + p\n(15)\nw\u03c4 = \u01eb(u \u2212 w)\nTherefore the transformation x\u03042 = x2 /\u01eb can be viewed as a rescaling of the\ndiffusion strength by \u01eb2 . We introduce a new independent small parameter\n\u03b4\u0304 = \u01eb2 and then let \u03b4\u0304 = \u01eb2 \u2192 0. This assumes that O(\u01eb) terms do not vanish in\nthis limit, yielding the diffusion free system. Then the slow manifold S0 of (14)\nis:\n\u001a\n\u001b\n1\nS0 = (x1 , x\u03042 , y) \u2208 R3 : x\u03042 =\n(f (x1 ) \u2212 y + p)\n(16)\ns\u01eb\nProposition 2. Following time rescaling by s, the slow flow of system (14) on\nS0 in the variables (x1 , y) is given by\n\u01eb\u1e8b1\n\n=\n\n\u1e8f\n\n=\n\nf (x1 ) \u2212 y + p\n\nx1 \u2212 y\n\n(17)\n\nIn the variables (x1 , x\u03042 ) the vector field (17) becomes\n\u1e8b1\n\n=\n\nx\u03042\n\n\u01ebx\u0304 \u0307 2\n\n=\n\n\u2212\n\nx\u03042 \u2032\n1\n(x1 \u2212 f (x1 ) \u2212 p) +\n(f (x1 ) \u2212 \u01eb)\ns2\ns\n10\n\n(18)\n\n\fRemark: The reduction to equations (17)-(18) suggests that (14) is a three\ntime-scale system. Note however that (14) is not given in the three time-scale\nform (\u01eb2 \u017c1 , \u01eb\u017c2 , \u017c3 ) = (h1 (z), h2 (z), h3 (z)) for z = (z1 , z2 , z3 ) \u2208 R3 and hi : R3 \u2192\nR (i = 1, 2, 3). The time-scale separation in (17)-(18) results from the singular\n1/\u01eb dependence of the critical manifold S0 ; see (16).\nProof. (of Proposition 2) Use the defining equation for the slow manifold (16)\nand substitute it into \u1e8b1 = x\u03042 . A rescaling of time by t \u2192 st under the\nassumption that s > 0 yields the result (17). To derive (18) differentiate the\ndefining equation of S0 with respect to time:\nx\u0304 \u0307 2 =\nThe equations \u1e8f =\n(18).\n\n1\n1\n(\u1e8b1 f \u2032 (x1 ) \u2212 \u1e8f) =\n(x\u03042 f \u2032 (x1 ) \u2212 \u1e8f)\ns\u01eb\ns\u01eb\n\n1\ns (x1\n\n\u2212 y) and y = \u2212s\u01ebx\u03042 + f (x1 ) + p yield the equations\n\nBefore we start with the analysis of (17) we note that detailed bifurcation\ncalculations for (17) exist. For example, Rocsoreanu et al. [44] give a detailed\noverview on the FitzHugh equation (17) and collect many relevant references.\nTherefore we shall only state the relevant bifurcation results and focus on the\nfast-slow structure and canards. Equation (17) has a critical manifold given by\ny = f (x1 ) + p = c(x1 ) which coincides with the critical manifold of the full\nFitzHugh-Nagumo system (6). Formally it is located in R2 but we still denote\nit by C0 . Recall that the fold points are located at\nx1,\u00b1 =\n\n\u221a \u0011\n1 \u0010\n11 \u00b1 91\n30\n\nor numerically: x1,+ \u2248 0.6846,\n\nx1,\u2212 \u2248 0.0487\n\nAlso recall that the y-nullcline passes through the fold points at:\np\u2212 \u2248 0.0511\n\nand\n\np+ \u2248 0.5584\n\nWe easily find that supercritical Hopf bifurcations are located at the values\nr\n2057\n359\u01eb 509\u01eb2\n\u01eb3\n11728171\npH,\u00b1 (\u01eb) =\n\u00b1\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n(19)\n6750\n182250000 1350\n2700\n27\nFor the case \u01eb = 0.01 we get pH,\u2212 (0.01) \u2248 0.05632 and pH,+ (0.01) \u2248 0.55316.\nThe periodic orbits generated in the Hopf bifurcations exist for p \u2208 (pH,\u2212 , pH,+ ).\nObserve also that pH,\u00b1 (0) = p\u00b1 ; so the Hopf bifurcations of (17) coincide in\nthe singular limit with the fold bifurcations in the one-dimensional slow flow\n(8). We are also interested in canards in the system and calculate a first order\nasymptotic expansion for the location of the maximal canard in (17) following\n[37]; recall that trajectories lying in the intersection of attracting and repelling\nslow manifolds are called maximal canards. We restrict to canards near the fold\npoint (x1,\u2212 , c(x1,\u2212 )).\n\n11\n\n\fProposition 3. Near the fold point (x1,\u2212 , c(x1,\u2212 )) the maximal canard in (p, \u01eb)\nparameter space is given by:\n5\np(\u01eb) = x1,\u2212 \u2212 c(x1,\u2212 ) + \u01eb + O(\u01eb3/2 )\n8\nProof. Let \u0233 = y \u2212 p and consider the shifts\nx1 \u2192 x1 + x1,\u2212 ,\n\n\u0233 \u2192 \u0233 + c(x1,\u2212 ),\n\np \u2192 p + x1,\u2212 \u2212 c(x1,\u2212 )\n\nto translate the equilibrium of (17) to the origin when p = 0. This gives\n!\n\u221a\n91\n\u2032\n2\nx1 = x1\n\u2212 x1 \u2212 \u0233 = f \u0304(x1 , \u0233)\n10\ny\u2032\n\n=\n\n\u01eb(x1 \u2212 \u0233 \u2212 p) = \u01eb(\u1e21(x1 , \u0233) \u2212 p)\n\n(20)\n\nNow apply Theorem 3.1 in [37] to find that the maximal canard of (20) is given\nby:\n5\np(\u01eb) = \u01eb + O(\u01eb3/2 )\n8\nShifting the parameter p back to the original coordinates yields the result.\nIf we substitute \u01eb = 0.01 in the previous asymptotic result and neglect terms\nof order O(\u01eb3/2 ) then the maximal canard is predicted to occur for p \u2248 0.05731\nwhich is right after the first supercritical Hopf bifurcation at pH,\u2212 \u2248 0.05632.\nTherefore we expect that there exist canard orbits evolving along the middle\nbranch of the critical manifold Cm,0.01 in the full FitzHugh-Nagumo equation.\nMaximal canards are part of a process generally referred to as canard explosion\n[10, 39, 7]. In this situation the small periodic orbits generated in the Hopf\nbifurcation at p = pH,\u2212 undergo a transition to relaxation oscillations within\na very small interval in parameter space. A variational integral determines\nwhether the canards are stable [39, 26].\nProposition 4. The canard cycles generated near the maximal canard point in\nparameter space for equation (17) are stable.\nProof. Consider the differential equation (17) in its transformed form (20). Obviously this will not affect the stability analysis of any limit cycles. Let xl (h)\nand xm (h) denote the two smallest x1 -coordinates of the intersection between\n\u221a\n91 2\n2\nx \u2212 x31 = \u03c6(x1 )}\nC\u03040 := {(x1 , \u0233) \u2208 R : \u0233 =\n10 1\nand the line \u0233 = h. Geometrically xl represents a point on the left branch and\nxm a point on the middle branch of the critical manifold C\u03040 . Theorem 3.4 in\n[39] tells us that the canards are stable cycles if the function\nR(h) =\n\nZ\n\nxm (h)\n\nxl (h)\n\n\u03c6\u2032 (x1 )\n\u2202 f \u0304\n(x1 , \u03c6(x1 ))\ndx1\n\u2202x1\n\u1e21(x1 , \u03c6(x1 ))\n12\n\n\f\u221a\n\nis negative for all values h \u2208 (0, \u03c6( 1591 )] where x1 =\nof C\u03040 besides x1 = 0.

Figure 4 shows a numerical plot of\nthe function R(h) for the relevant values of h which confirms the required result.\nR\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.10\n\n0.12\n\nh\n\n-0.02\n-0.04\n-0.06\n-0.08\n-0.10\n\nFigure 4: Plot of the function R(h) for h \u2208 (0, \u03c6(\n\n\u221a\n\n91\n15 )].\n\nRemark: We have computed an explicit algebraic expression for R\u2032 (h) with\na\n\u221a\ncomputer algebra system. This expression yields R\u2032 (h) < 0 for h \u2208 (0, \u03c6( 1591 )],\nconfirming that R(h) is decreasing.\nAs long as we stay on the critical manifold C0 of the full system, the analysis\nof the bifurcations and geometry of (17) give good approximations to the dynamics of the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation because the rescaling x2 = \u01ebx\u03042 leaves\nthe plane x2 = 0 invariant. Next we use the dynamics of the x\u03042 -coordinate\nin system (18) to obtain better insight into the dynamics when x2 6= 0. The\ncritical manifold D0 of (18) is:\nD0 = {(x1 , x\u03042 ) \u2208 R2 : sx\u03042 c\u2032 (x1 ) = x1 \u2212 c(x1 )}\nWe are interested in the geometry of the periodic orbits shown in Figure 5 that\nemerge from the Hopf bifurcation at pH,\u2212 . Observe that the amplitude of the\norbits in the x1 direction is much larger that than in the x2 -direction. Therefore\nwe predict only a single small excursion in the x2 direction for p slightly larger\nthan pH,\u2212 as shown in Figures 5(a) and 5(c).

Note that at p\u00b1 the equilibrium point passes through\nthe two fold points.\nProof. The expression for s(x\u22171 )2 in (21) is positive when 1 + 10\u01eb \u2212 22x\u22171 +\n30(x\u22171 )2 < 0.

The critical\nmanifold C0 is shown in red and periodic orbits are shown in blue. Only the\nfirst and the last critical manifold for the continuation run are shown; not all\nperiodic orbits obtained during the continuation are displayed.\nThe analysis of the slow subsystems (17) and (18) gives a conjecture about\nthe shape of the periodic orbits in the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation. Consider\nthe parameter regime close to a Hopf bifurcation point. From (17) we expect\none part of the small periodic orbits generated in the Hopf bifurcation to lie\nclose to the slow manifolds Cl,\u01eb and Cm,\u01eb . Using the results about equation\n(18) we anticipate the second part to consist of an excursion in the x2 direction\nwhose length is governed by the wave speed s. Figure 6 shows a numerical continuation in MatCont [22] of the periodic orbits generated in a Hopf bifurcation\nand confirms the singular limit analysis for small amplitude orbits.\nFurthermore we observe from comparison of the x1 and x2 coordinates of the\nperiodic orbits in Figure 6(b) that orbits tend to lie close to the plane defined\nby x2 = 0. More precisely, the x2 diameter of the periodic orbits is observed to\nbe O(\u01eb) in this case. This indicates that the rescaling of Section 2.3 can help to\ndescribe the system close to the U-shaped Hopf curve. Note that it is difficult\nto check whether this observation of an O(\u01eb)-diameter in the x2 -coordinate persists for values of \u01eb < 0.01 since numerical continuation of canard-type periodic\norbits is difficult to use for smaller \u01eb.\nIn contrast to this, it is easily possible to compute the U-shaped Hopf curve\nusing numerical continuation for very small values of \u01eb. We have used this\npossibility to track two generalized Hopf bifurcation points in three parameters\n(p, s, \u01eb). The U-shaped Hopf curve has been computed by numerical continuation for a mesh of parameter values for \u01eb between 10\u22122 and 10\u22127 using MatCont\n\u01eb\non the left half of the U-curve were\n[22]. The two generalized Hopf points GH1,2\ndetected as codimension two points during each continuation run.

Each point in the figure corresponds to a different value of \u01eb. The point\nGH1\u01eb in 7(a) corresponds to the point shown as a square in Figure 1 and the\npoint GH2\u01eb in 7(b) is further up on the left branch of the U-curve and is not\ndisplayed in Figure 1.\nlimits in (p, s)-parameter space are approximately:\nGH10 \u2248 (p = 0.171, s = 0)\n\nand\n\nGH20 \u2248 (p = 0.051, s = 3.927)\n\nWe have not found a way to recover these special points from the fast-slow decomposition of the system. This suggests that codimension two bifurcations are\ngenerally diffcult to recover from the singular limit of fast-slow systems.\nFurthermore the Hopf bifurcations for the full system on the left half of the\nU-curve are subcritical between GH1\u01eb and GH2\u01eb and supercritical otherwise. For\nthe transformed system (14) with two slow and one fast variable we observed\nthat in the singular limit (17) for \u01eb2 \u2192 0 the Hopf bifurcation is supercritical.\nIn the case of \u01eb = 0.01 the periodic orbits for (6) and (17) exist in overlapping\nregions for the parameter p between the p-values of GH10.01 and GH20.01 . This\nresult indicates that (14) can be used to describe periodic orbits that will interact\nwith the homoclinic C-curve.\n\n3.2\n\nHomoclinic Orbits\n\nIn the following discussion we refer to \"the\" C-shaped curve of homoclinic bifurcations of system (5) as the parameters yielding a \"single-pulse\" homoclinic\norbit. The literature as described in Section 1.2 shows that close to single-pulse\nhomoclinic orbits we can expect multi-pulse homoclinic orbits that return close\nto the equilibrium point multiple times. Since the separation of slow manifolds\nC*,\u01eb is exponentially small, homoclinic orbits of different types will always occur\nin exponentially thin bundles in parameter space. Values of \u01eb < 0.005 are small\nenough that the parameter region containing all the homoclinic orbits will be\nindistinguishable numerically from \"the\" C-curve that we locate.\n\n16\n\n\fThe history of proofs of the existence of homoclinic orbits in the FitzHughNagumo equation is quite extensive. The main step in their construction is\nthe existence of a \"singular\" homoclinic orbit \u03b30 . We consider the case when\nthe fast subsystem has three equilibrium points which we denote by xl \u2208 Cl ,\nxm \u2208 Cm and xr \u2208 Cr . Recall that xl coincides with the unique equilibrium\nq = (x\u22171 , 0, x\u22171 ) of the full system for p < p\u2212 . A singular homoclinic orbit is\nalways constructed by first following the unstable manifold of xl in the fast subsystem given by y = x\u22171 .\n\np=\u22120.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n2\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\nx\n\nx\n\n2\n\np=\u22120.24602\n0.2\n\n\u22120.1\n\u22120.2\n\n0\n\u22120.1\n\n0\n\n0.5\nx\n\n\u22120.2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\np=0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n2\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\nx\n\nx\n\n2\n\np=0\n0.2\n\n\u22120.1\n\u22120.2\n\n0.5\nx\n\n1\n\n0\n\u22120.1\n\n0\n\n0.5\nx\n\n\u22120.2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0.5\nx\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nFigure 8: Homoclinic orbits as level curves of H(x1 , x2 ) for equation (12) with\ny = x\u22171 .\nFirst assume that s = 0. In this case the Hamiltonian structure - see Section\n2.2 and equation (12) - can be used to show the existence of a singular homoclinic\norbit. Figure 8 shows level curves H(x1 , x2 ) = H(x\u22171 , 0) for various values of p.\nThe double heteroclinic connection can be calculated directly using Proposition\n1 and solving x\u22171 + p\u0304\u2217 = p for p.\nProposition 6. There exists a singular double heteroclinic connection in the\nFitzHugh-Nagumo equation for s = 0 and p \u2248 \u22120.246016 = p\u2217 .\nTechniques developed in [45] show that the singular homoclinic orbits existing for s = 0 and p \u2208 (p\u2217 , p\u2212 ) must persist for perturbations of small positive\nwave speed and sufficiently small \u01eb. These orbits are associated to the lower\nbranch of the C-curve. The expected geometry of the orbits is indicated by\ntheir shape in the singular limit shown in Figure 8. The double heteroclinic\nconnection is the boundary case between the upper and lower half of the Ccurve. It remains to analyze the singular limit for the upper half. In this case,\n17\n\n\fa singular homoclinic orbit is again formed by following the unstable manifold\nof xl when it coincides with the equilibrium q = (x\u22171 , 0, x\u22171 ) but now we check\nwhether it forms a heteroclinic orbit with the stable manifold of xr . Then we\nfollow the slow flow on Cr and return on a heteroclinic connection to Cl for a\ndifferent y-coordinate with y > x\u22171 and y < c(x1,+ ) = f (x1 ) + p. From there\nwe connect back via the slow flow. Using the numerical method described in\nSection 2.2 we first set y = x\u22171 ; note that the location of q depends on the value\nof the parameter p. The task is to check when the system\nx\u20321\n\n=\n\nx\u20322\n\n=\n\nx2\n1\n(f (x1 ) + y \u2212 p)\n5\n\n(22)\n\nhas heteroclinic orbits from Cl to Cr with y = x\u22171 . The result of this computation is shown in Figure 9 as the red curve. We have truncated the result at\np = \u22120.01. In fact, the curve in Figure 9 can be extended to p = p\u2217 . Obviously\nwe should view this curve as an approximation to the upper part of the C-curve.\n\n1.6\n1.5\n1.4\n\ns\n\n1.3\n1.2\n1.1\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n\u22120.02\n\n0\n\n0.02\n\np\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\nFigure 9: Heteroclinic connections for equation (22) in parameter space. The red\ncurve indicates left-to-right connections for y = x\u22171 and the blue curves indicate\nright-to-left connections for y = x\u22171 + v with v = 0.125, 0.12, 0.115 (from top to\nbottom).\nIf the connection from Cr back to Cl occurs with vertical coordinate x\u22171 +v, it\nis a trajectory of system (22) with y = x\u22171 + v. Figure 9 shows values of (p, s) at\nwhich these heteroclinic orbits exist for v = 0.125, 0.12, 0.115. An intersection\nbetween a red and a blue curve indicates a singular homoclinic orbit. Further\ncomputations show that increasing the value of v slowly beyond 0.125 yields\nintersections everywhere along the red curve in Figure 9. Thus the values of v\non the homoclinic orbits are expected to grow as s increases along the upper\nbranch of the C-curve. Since there cannot be any singular homoclinic orbits for\np \u2208 (p\u2212 , p+ ) we have to find the intersection of the red curve in Figure 9 with\nthe vertical line p = p\u2212 . Using the numerical method to detect heteroclinic\nconnections gives:\n18\n\n\fProposition 7. The singular homoclinic curve for positive wave speed terminates at p = p\u2212 and s \u2248 1.50815 = s\u2217 on the right and at p = p\u2217 and s = 0 on\nthe left.\nIn (p, s)-parameter space define the points:\nA = (p\u2217 , 0),\n\nB = (p\u2212 , 0),\n\nC = (p\u2212 , s\u2217 )\n\n(23)\n\nIn Figure 10 we have computed the homoclinic C-curve for values of \u01eb between\n10\u22122 and 5 * 10\u22125 . Together with the singular limit analysis above, this yields\nstrong numerical evidence for the following conjecture:\nConjecture 1. The C-shaped homoclinic bifurcation curves converge to the\nunion of the segments AB and AC as \u01eb \u2192 0.\nRemark 1: Figure 4 of Krupa, Sandstede and Szmolyan [38] shows a \"wedge\"\nthat resembles shown in Figure 10. The system that they study sets p = 0 and\nvaries a with a \u2248 1/2. For a = 1/2 and p = 0, the equilibrium point q is\nlocated at the origin and the fast subsystem with y = 0 has a double heteroclinic connection at q to the saddle equilibrium (1, 0, 0) \u2208 Cr . The techniques\ndeveloped in [38] use this double heteroclinic connection as a starting point.\nGeneralizations of the results in [38] might provide a strategy to prove Conjecture 1 rigorously, a possibility that we have not yet considered. However, we\nthink that 1-homoclinic orbits in the regime we study come in pairs and that\nthe surface of 1-homoclinic orbits in (p, s, \u01eb) space differs qualitatively from that\ndescribed by Krupa, Sandstede and Szmolyan.\nRemark 2: We have investigated the termination or turning mechanism of\nthe C-curve at its upper end. The termination points shown in Figure 1 have\nbeen obtained by a different geometric method. It relies on the observation that,\nin addition to the two fast heteroclinic connections, we have to connect near Cl\nback to the equilibrium point q to form a homoclinic orbit; the two heteroclinic\nconnections might persist as intersections of suitable invariant manifolds but we\nalso have to investigate how the flow near Cl,\u01eb interacts with the stable manifold W s (q). These results will be reported elsewhere, but we note here that\npturn (\u01eb) \u2192 p\u2212 .\nThe numerical calculations of the C-curves for \u01eb \u2264 10\u22123 are new. Numerical\ncontinuation using the boundary value methods implemented in AUTO [14] or\nMatCont [22] becomes very difficult for these small values of \u01eb [5]. Even computing with values \u01eb = O(10\u22122 ) using boundary value methods is a numerically\nchallenging problem. The method we have used does not compute the homoclinic orbits themselves while it locates the homoclinic C-curve accurately in\nparameter space. To motivate our approach consider Figure 11 which shows the\nunstable manifold W u (q) for different values of s and fixed p. We observe that\nhomoclinic orbits can only exist near two different wave speeds s1 and s2 which\ndefine the parameters where W u (q) \u2282 W s (Cl,\u01eb ) or W u (q) \u2282 W s (Cr,\u01eb ).

If s\ndiffers from the points s1 and s2 that define the lower and upper branches of\nthe C-curve for the given value of p, then |x1 | increases rapidly on W u (q) away\nfrom q. The changes in sign of x1 on W u (q) identify values of s with homoclinic\norbits. The two splitting points that mark these sign changes are visible in\nFigure 11. Since trajectories close to the slow manifolds separate exponentially\naway from them, we are able to assess the sign of x1 unambiguously on trajectories close to the slow manifold and find small intervals (p, s1 \u00b1 10\u221215 ) and\n(p, s2 \u00b1 10\u221215) that contain the values of s for which there are homoclinic orbits.\nThe geometry of the orbits along the upper branch of the C-curve is obtained\nby approximating it with two fast singular heteroclinic connections and parts of\nthe slow manifolds Cr,\u01eb and Cl,\u01eb ; this process has been described several times in\nthe literature when different methods were used to prove the existence of \"fast\nwaves\" (see e.g. [29, 4, 32]).\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nOur results are summarized in the singular bifurcation diagram shown in Figure 12.

The U-shaped Hopf curve was computed with an explicit formula,\nand the homoclinic C-curve was determined by locating transitions between different dynamical behaviors separated by the homoclinic orbits. All the results\nshown as solid lines in Figure 12 have been obtained by considering a singular\nlimit. The lines AB and AC as well as the slow flow bifurcation follow from\nthe singular limit \u01eb \u2192 0 yielding the fast and slow subsystems of the FitzHughNagumo equation (6). The analysis of canards and periodic orbits have been\nobtained from equations (17) and (18) where the singular limit \u01eb2 \u2192 0 was used\n(see Section 2.3). We have also shown the C- and U-curves in Figure 12 as dotted lines to orient the reader how the results from Proposition 5 and Conjecture\n1 fit in.\nWe also observed that several dynamical phenomena are difficult to recover\nfrom the singular limit fast-slow decomposition. In particular, the codimension\ntwo generalized Hopf bifurcation does not seem to be observable from the singular limit analysis. Furthermore the homoclinic orbits can be constructed from\nthe singular limits but it cannot be determined directly from the fast and slow\nsubsystems that they are of Shilnikov-type.\nThe type of analysis pursued here seems to be very useful for other multiple\ntime-scale problems involving multi-parameter bifurcation problems. In future\nwork, we shall give a geometric analysis of the folding/turning mechanism of the\nhomoclinic C-curve, a feature of this system we have not been able to determine\ndirectly from our singular limit analysis. That work relies upon new methods\nfor calculating Cl,\u01eb and Cr,\u01eb which are invariant slow manifolds of \"saddle-type\"\nwith both stable and unstable manifolds.\nWe end with brief historical remarks.

The points A, B and C are\ndefined in (23). The part of the diagram obtained from equations (17),(18) corresponds to the case \"\u01eb2 = 0 and \u01eb 6= 0 and\nsmall\". In this scenario the canards to the right of p = p\u2212 are stable (see Proposition 4). The phase portrait in the upper\nright for equation (17) shows the geometry of a small periodic orbit generated in the Hopf bifurcation of (17). The two phase\nportraits below it show the geometry of these periodic orbits further away from the Hopf bifurcation for (17),(18). Excursions\nof the periodic orbits/canards for p > p\u2212 decrease for larger values of s. Note also that we have indicated as dotted lines the\nC-curve and the U-curve for positive \u01eb to allow a qualitative comparison with Figure 1.\n\n\fdiscuss mathematical challenges posed by the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation, how\nthese challenges have been analyzed and their relationship to general questions\nabout multiple time-scale systems. Along the line AB in Figure 12 we encounter\na perturbation problem regarding the persistence of homoclinic orbits that can\nbe solved using Fenichel theory [45]. The point A marks the connection between fast and slow waves in (p, s)-parameter space which has been investigated\nin (\u01eb, s)-parameter space in [38]. We view this codimension 2 connectivity as one\nof the key features of the FitzHugh-Nagumo system. The perturbation problem\nfor homoclinic orbits close to the line AC was solved using several methods and\nwas put into the context of multiple time-scale systems in [31, 32], where the\nExchange Lemma overcame difficulties in tracking W u (q) when it starts jumping away from Cr,\u01eb . This theory provides rigorous foundations that support our\nnumerical computations and their interpretation.\nAcknowledgment: This research was partially supported by the National\nScience Foundation and Department of Energy.\n\nReferences\n[1] D.G.
