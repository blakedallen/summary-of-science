The gas metallicity in galaxies provides important information\nbecause it is a tracer of their star formation history. However, the observation\nof faint emission lines (most of which are in the rest-frame optical range and\ntherefore shifted into the near infrared at high-z), associated with H ii regions\nin star forming galaxies, is very difficult and time consuming. Instead, AGNs\nexhibit bright emission lines at rest-frame UV wavelengths, which can be used\nto investigate the gas metallicity even in high-z objects . In this contribution,\nwe report our recent studies on the gas metallicity of high-z AGNs for both the\nbroad-line region (BLR) and the narrow-line region (NLR). Details are given in\nNagao et al. (2006a), Nagao et al. (2006b), and Maiolino et al. (2006).\n2.\n\nThe BLR Metallicity\n\nThe BLR metallicity in quasars is generally higher than solar (e.g., Hamann &\nFerland 1992; Dietrich et al. 2003). Some observations suggest that quasars\nat higher-z quasars show higher metallicity than lower-z quasars (e.g., Hamann\n1\n\n\f2\n\nNagao, Maiolino and Marconi\n\nFigure 1.\nMetallicity-sensitive emission-line flux ratios, Nv/Civ (upper)\nand Nv/Heii (lower), measured in the composite spectra of the SDSS quasars\nare shown as functions of redshift (lef t) and absolute B magnitude (right).\n\n& Ferland 1992). It is also recognized that the BLR metallicity tends to be\nhigher in more luminous quasars (e.g., Hamann & Ferland 1993). However,\nsince higher luminosity quasars tend to be selectively observed at higher-z, the\nabove relationes are degenerate. More specifically, it was not clear whether the\nBLR metallicity depends primarily on the luminosity or on the redshift.\nTo tackle this issue we focused on SDSS quasars. We retrived 5344 spectra\nof quasars at 2.0 \u2264 z \u2264 4.5 from the SDSS Data Release 2. The quasars\nwere divided into redshift and luminosity bins with intervals \u2206z = 0.5 and\n\u2206MB = 1 mag. Then we made a composite spectrum for each (z, MB ) bin, after\ncorrecting for the Galactic reddening, removing BAL quasars, and by applying\nan appropriate normalization.\nThe composite spectra show that there are significant correlations between\nthe quasars luminosity and various metallicity-sensitive emission-line flux ratios,\nsuch as Nv/Civ and Nv/Heii, while there are almost no correlations between the\nquasars redshift and such emission-line flux ratios (Figure 1). The correlation\nof line ratios with luminosity is interpreted in terms of higher gas metallicity in\nmore luminous quasars. For a given quasar luminosity, there is no significant\nmetallicity evolution within the redshift range 2.0 \u2264 z \u2264 4.5. The absence of the\nmetallicity evolution up to z \u223c 4.5 may suggest that the active star-formation\nepoch of quasar host galaxies occurred at z >\n\u223c 7, inferred by timescale required\nfor the enrichment of some elements such as C and Si (produced mainly by lowor intermediate-mass evolved stars).\n\n\fMetallicity Evolution of AGNs\n\n3\n\nFigure 2.\nAveraged NLR flux ratios, compared with model predictions on\nthe Civ/Heii versus Ciii]/Civ diagram, for radio galaxies grouped in bins\nof redshift (lef t) and of Heii luminosity (right). The dotted and solid lines\ndenote the loci of predicted flux ratios at constant gas density and at ionization\nparameter, respectively (assuming nH = 105 cm\u22123 ). Thin error bars denote\nthe RMS of the data distribution, and thick error bars denote the estimated\nerrors on the averaged flux ratios.\n\n3.\n\nThe NLR Metallicity\n\nThe NLR metallicity offers information complementary to the BLR metallicity\nsince it traces spatial scales comparable with the host galaxies, although the\nmeasurements are much more tough with respect to the BLR. By using the\nNv/Civ flux ratio, De Breuck (2000) claimed a NLR metallicity evolution of\nradio galaxies, in their spectroscopic sample, from z > 3 to z < 3. However,\nsince the Nv emission becomes very weak at low metallicities, only upper-limit\nfluxes on Nv are available for the majority of high-z radio galaxies, which makes\nthe studies on the evolution of the NLR metallicity difficult. Alternative diagnostics of the NLR metallicity are required to make further progresses in the\nuderstanding of the NLR metallicity at high-z.\nWe focused on Civ, Heii and Ciii], which are the most strong NLR emission\nlines seen in the rest-frame UV spectra. The Civ/Heii ratio is expected to\nbe sensitive to the NLR gas metallicity. This is because the gas temperature\ndecreases when the metallicity increases and thus the collisional excitation of Civ\nis gradually suppressed, while the Heii luminosity is basically proportional to the\nnumber of He++ ionizing photons and thus rather insensitive to the metallicity.\nThe Ciii]/Civ ratio is instead sensitive to the ionization degree and therefore\nit is used to check any dependence of Civ/Heii on the ionization state of the\ngas. As a result, a diagnostic diagram that consists of these two flux ratios is\nquite useful to estimate the NLR metallicity, without the need to rely on weak\nemission lines such as Nv (see also Groves et al. 2004).\n\n\f4\n\nNagao, Maiolino and Marconi\n\nWe investigated the spectroscopic data of radio galaxies at 1.2 \u2264 z \u2264 3.8\ngiven by De Breuck et al. (2000), and found that most of the flux ratios are\ninconsistent with shock models, suggesting that the NLRs of radio galaxies are\nmainly photoionized. We then compared the observed flux ratios with the results\nof our photoionization model calculations obtained by using Cloudy (Ferland et\nal. 1998) assuming one-zone, dust-free clouds. Note that NLR clouds emitting\nrelatively high ionization lines are expected to be dust-free (see, e.g., Marconi\net al. 1994; Nagao et al. 2003). The photoionization dust-free models provide\ntwo possible scenarios which are consistent with the observed data: low-density\n3\n\u22123\ngas clouds (nH <\n\u223c 10 cm ) with a sub-solar metallicity (0.2 <\n\u223c Zgas /Z\u2299 <\n\u223c\n1.0), or high-density gas clouds (nH \u223c 105 cm\u22123 ) with a wide range of gas\nmetallicity (0.2 <\n\u223c Zgas /Z\u2299 <\n\u223c 5.0). Regardless of the specific interpretation, the\nobservational data do not show any evidence for a significant evolution of the\ngas metallicity in the NLRs within the redshift range 1.2 \u2264 z \u2264 3.8 (Figure\n2). Instead, we found a trend for more luminous radio galaxies to have more\nmetal-rich gas clouds, which is in agreement with the same finding in the studies\nof the broad-line regions including ours (\u00a72).\nAcknowledgments.
