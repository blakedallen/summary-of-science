We study the Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) 060218: a particularly close source at z = 0.033 with an extremely long\nduration, namely T90 \u223c 2000 s, related to SN 2006aj. This source appears to be a very soft burst, with a peak in the spectrum\nat 4.9 keV, therefore interpreted as an X-Ray Flash (XRF). It fullfills the Amati relation. I present the fitting procedure, which\nis time consuming. In order to show its sensitivity I also present two examples of fits with the same value of B and different\nvalue of Eetot\n\u00b1 . We fit the X- and \u03b3 -ray observations by Swift of GRB 060218 in the 0.1\u2013150 keV energy band during the entire\ntime of observations from 0 all the way to 106 s within a unified theoretical model. The free parameters of our theory are\ntot of the e\u00b1 plasma, its baryon loading B \u2261 M c2 /E tot , as well as the CircumBurst\nonly three, namely the total energy Ee\u00b1\nB\ne\u00b1\ntot = 2.32 \u00d7 1050 erg, a\nMedium (CBM) distribution. We justify the extremely long duration of this GRB by a total energy Ee\u00b1\nvery high value of the baryon loading B = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22122 and the effective CircumBurst Medium (CBM) density which shows a\nradial dependence ncbm \u221d r\u2212\u03b1 with 1.0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 1.7 and monotonically decreases from 1 to 10\u22126 particles/cm3 . We recall that\nthis value of the B parameter is the highest among the sources we have analyzed and it is very close to its absolute upper limit\nexpected.\nBy our fit we show that there is no basic differences between XRFs and more general GRBs. They all originate from the\ncollapse process to a black hole and their difference is due to the variability of the three basic parameters within the range of\nfull applicability of the theory. We also think that the smallest possible black hole, formed by the gravitational collapse of a\nneutron star in a binary system, is consistent with the especially low energetics of the class of GRBs associated with SNe Ib/c.\nKeywords: GRBs and Binaries\nPACS: 98.70.Rz\n\nINTRODUCTION\nGRB 060218, discovered by the Swift satellite with cosmological redshift z = 0.033 [29], is one of the best examples of very long duration GRBs associated with core\ncollapse Supernovae [8]. We present a detailed fit of the\nX- and \u03b3 -ray luminosity in the entire time and energy\nband of observation, as well as details on the spectral\ndistribution during the prompt emission phase. The additional peculiarities of the source evidence the lowest\nvalue of the Circumburst Medium (CBM) number density as well as the highest value of the baryon loading\nparameter yet observed in a GRB source. In this sense\nthis source explores the applicability of GRB models in\na yet untested range of physical parameters.\nWe present the observational data of the source; then\nwe show the theoretical fit of the light curves observed\nby BAT and XRT (15\u2013150 keV and 0.1\u201310.0 keV respectively and the latest Chandra observations showing\npossible analogies to the class of faint GRBs at low value\nof cosmological redshift, see Fig. 1). We show in Fig.\n?? the predicted instantaneous spectrum from 100 s (i.e.\nduring the so called \"prompt emission\") all the way up\nto about 103 s (i.e. until the gamma peak ends).\n\nWe emphasize the aspects which makes this source\ntot = 2.32 \u00d7 1050 erg,\nso special: i) the total energy Ee\u00b1\ntot\nii) the baryon loading parameter B \u2261 MB c2 /Ee\u00b1\n= 1.0 \u00d7\n\u22122\n10 and iii) The effective CircumBurst Medium (CBM)\ndensity shows a radial dependence ncbm \u221d r\u2212\u03b1 with 1.0 \u2264\n\u03b1 \u2264 1.7 and monotonically decreases from 1 to 10\u22126\nparticles/cm3 . We are going to show in the following how\nthe occurrence of these three factors, within a consistent\ntheoretical framework [41, 42, 44, 36, 5, 6, 7], naturally\nleads to the explanation of the long duration (T90 \u223c 2000\ns) of this GRB.\nIn our approach we assume that all GRBs, short or\nlong, originate from the gravitational collapse to a black\nhole [42]. We have only two free parameters describing\ntot of the e\u00b1 plasma\nthe source, namely the total energy Ee\u00b1\nand its baryon loading B [47]. They characterize the optically thick adiabatic acceleration phase of the GRB,\nwhich lasts until the transparency condition is reached.\nAfter this acceleration phase, it starts the afterglow emission, due to the collision between the accelerated baryonic matter and the CBM. The CBM is described by\ntwo additional parameters: the effective particle number\ndensity hnCBM i and the ratio between the effective emitting area and the total area of the pulse, R \u2261 Ae f f /Avis\n\n\f[45], which both takes into account the CBM filamentary\nstructure [46]. We emphasize the belonging to the Amati\nrelation.\n\nTHE OBSERVATIONAL PROPERTIES\nOF THE SOURCE\nGRB 060218 has been triggered and located by the BAT\ninstrument [11] on board of the Swift satellite on 18\nFebruary 2006. It has a very long duration with T90 \u223c\n(2100 \u00b1 100)s. The XRT [11] began observations \u223c 153\ns after the BAT triggerKa06 and continued to detect the\nsource for \u223c 12.3 days [48]. The source is characterized\nby a flat gamma ray light curve and a soft spectrum [2].\nIt has an X-ray light curve with a long, slow rise and\ngradual decline and it is considered an X-ray flash since\nits peak energy occurs at E p = 4.9+0.4\n\u22120.3 keV [8]. The\nburst fluence in the 15\u2013150 keV band is (6.8 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7\n10\u22126 erg/cm2 [48]. The spectroscopic redshift has been\nfound to be z = 0.033 [29]. At this redshift the isotropic\nequivalent energy is Eiso = (1.9 \u00b1 0.1) \u00d7 1049 erg [48].\nThis faint, low redshift GRB could be a good candidate to\nbe associated with a Supernova. In fact it has been found\nan underlying Type Ic Supernova: SN2006aj [33]. This\nSupernova shows observational features very similar to\nthe other ones associated with GRBs. In particular it has\na very large expansion velocity of v \u223c 0.1c [33, 15, 50].\n\nTHE FIT OF THE OBSERVED DATA\nIn this section we present the fit of our fireshell model\nto the observed data (see Fig. 1). The fit leads to a to50\ntal energy of the e\u00b1 plasma Eetot\nerg, with\n\u00b1 = 2.32 \u00d7 10\nan initial temperature T = 1.86 MeV and a total number of pairs Ne\u00b1 = 1.79 \u00d7 1055. The second parameter of the theory, B = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22122 , is close to the limit\nfor the stability of the adiabatic optically thick acceleration phase of the fireshell (for further details see [47]).\nThe Lorentz gamma factor obtained solving the fireshell\nequations of motion [6, 7] is \u03b3\u25e6 = 99.2 at the beginning\nof the afterglow phase at a distance from the progenitor\nr\u25e6 = 7.82 \u00d7 1012 cm.\nIn Fig. 1 we show the afterglow light curves fitting\nthe prompt emission both in the BAT (15\u2013150 keV) and\nin the XRT (0.3\u201310 keV) energy ranges, as expected in\nour \"canonical GRB\" scenario (see Dainotti et al., in\npreparation). Initially the two luminosities are comparable to each other, but for a detector arrival time tad > 1000\ns the XRT curves becomes dominant. The displacement\nbetween the peaks of these two light curves leads to a\ntheoretically estimated spectral lag greater than 500 s in\nperfect agreement with the observations [22].\n\nWe recall that at tad \u223c 104 s there is a sudden enhancement in the radio luminosity and there is an optical luminosity dominated by the SN2006aj emission [8, 51].\nAlthough our analysis addresses only the BAT and XRT\nobservations, for r > 1018 cm corresponding to tad > 104\ns the fit of the XRT data implies two new features: 1) a\nsudden increase of the R factor from R = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u221211\nto R = 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22126, corresponding to a significantly more\nhomogeneous effective CBM distribution; 2) an XRT luminosity much smaller than the bolometric one (see Fig.\n1). Therefore, we identify two different regimes in the\nafterglow, one for tad < 104 s and the other for tad > 104\ns. Nevertheless, there is a unifying feature: the determined effective CBM density decreases with the distance\nr monotonically and continuously through both these two\nregimes from ncbm = 1 particle/cm3 at r = r\u25e6 to ncbm =\n10\u22126 particle/cm3 at r = 6.0 \u00d7 1018 cm: ncbm \u221d r\u2212\u03b1 , with\n1.0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 1.7.\n\nTHE PROCEDURE OF THE FIT\nThe arrival time of each photon at the detector depends\non the entire previous history of the fireshell [41]. Moreover, all the observables depends on the EQTS [5, 6]\nwhich, in turn, depend crucially on the equations of motion of the fireshell. The CBM engulfment has to be computed self-consistently through the entire dynamical evolution of the fireshell and not separately at each point.\nAny change in the CBM distribution strongly influences\nthe entire dynamical evolution of the fireshell and, due\nto the EQTS structure, produces observable effects up to\na much later time. For example if we change the density\nmask at a certain distance from the black hole we modify\nthe shape of the lightcurve and consequently the evolution changes at larger radii corresponding to later times.\nAnyway the change of the density is not the only problem to face in the fitting of the source, in fact first of all\nwe have to choose the energy in order to have Lorentz\ngamma factor sufficiently high to fit the entire GRB. In\norder to show the sensitivity of the fitting procedure I\nalso present two examples of fits with the same value\nof B and different value of Eetot\n\u00b1 . The first example has an\n50\ntot\nEe\u00b1 = 1.36 \u00d7 10 erg . This fit resulted unsuccessfully as\nwe see from the Fig.2, because the bolometric lightcurve\nis under the XRT peak of the afterglow. This means that\nthe value of the energy chosen is too small to fit any data\npoints after the peak of the afterglow. So we have to increase the value of the Energy to a have a better fit. In\nfact the parameters values have been found with various\nattempt in order to obtain the best fit.

So again in this case the value of the Energy chosen is too small, but it is better than the previous attempt.\nIn this case we increased the energy value of the 24%,\nbut it is not enough so we decide to increase 16%.

On\nthe contrary, a distinguishing feature of our theoretical\napproach is to differentiate between the SN and the GRB\nprocess. The GRB is assumed to occur during the formation process of a black hole. The SN is assumed to lead\nto the formation of a neutron star (NS) or to a complete\ndisruptive explosion without remnants and, in no way, to\nthe formation of a black hole. In the case of SN2006aj\nthe formation of such a NS has been actually inferred by\nMaeda et al. [27] because of the large amount of 58 Ni\n(0.05M\u2299). Moreover the significantly small initial mass\nof the SN progenitor star M \u2248 20M\u2299 is expected to form\na NS rather than a black hole when its core collapses\n[27, 17, 28, 31]. In order to fulfill both the above requirement, we assume that the progenitor of the GRB and the\nSN consists of a binary system formed by a NS close to\n\nits critical mass collapsing to a black hole, and a companion star evolved out of the main sequence originating the\nSN. The temporal coincidence between the GRB and the\nSN phenomenon is explained in term of the concept of\n\"induced\" gravitational collapse [43, 39]. There is also\nthe distinct possibility of observing the young born NS\nout of the SN [see e.g. 39, and references therein].\nIt has been often proposed that GRBs associated with\nSNe Ib/c, at smaller redshift 0.0085 < z < 0.168 [see e.g.\n12, and references therein], form a different class, less\nluminous and possibly much more numerous than the\nhigh luminosity GRBs at higher redshift [33, 49, 27, 12].\nTherefore they have been proposed to originate from a\nseparate class of progenitors [23, 9]. In our model this is\nexplained by the nature of the progenitor system leading\nto the formation of the black hole with the smallest\npossible mass: the one formed by the collapse of a just\novercritical NS [35, 39].\nThe recent observation of GRB060614 at z = 0.125\nwithout an associated SN [13, 25] gives strong support\nto our scenario, alternative to the collapsar model. Also\nin this case the progenitor of the GRB appears to be a\nbinary system composed of two NSs or a NS and a white\ndwarf (Caito et al., in preparation).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nGRB060218 presents a variety of peculiarities, including\nits extremely large T90 and its classification as an XRF.\nThe anomalously long T90 led us to infer a monotonic decrease in the CBM effective density. The spectrum from\nthe prompt phase to the early part of the afterglow varies\n\n\f-7\n\n10\n\nSimulazione in banda di XRT\ndati definitivi in x\nsimulazione in Bat\nDati definitivi di BAT\n\n46\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n10\n\n45\n\n-9\n\n10\n44\n\n2\n\n10\n\nObserved flux (erg/(cm *s))\n\nSource luminosity (erg/(s*sterad))\n\n10\n\n-10\n\n10\n43\n\n10\n\n-11\n\n10\n42\n\n10\n\n-12\n\n10\n41\n\n10\n\n-13\n\n10\n40\n\n10\n\n-14\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n4\n\n10\n10\nDetector arrival time (s)\n\n5\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n10\n\n7\n\n10\n\n50 erg: our theoretical fit (blue line) of the 15\u2013150 keV BAT\nFIGURE 2.

Our scenario originates from the gravitational collapse to a black hole and is now confirmed over\na 106 range in energy. It is clear that, although the process of gravitational collapse is unique, there is a large\nvariety of progenitors which may lead to the formation\nof black holes, each one with precise signatures in the\nenergetics. The low energetics of the class of GRBs associated with SNe, and the necessity of the occurrence\nof the SN, naturally leads in our model to identify their\nprogenitors with the formation of the smallest possible\nblack hole originating from a NS overcoming his critical\nmass in a binary system. GRB060218 is the first GRB\nassociated with SN with complete coverage of data from\nthe onset all the way up to \u223c 106 s. This fact offers an\nunprecedented opportunity to verify theoretical models\non such a GRB class.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
