(For a recent review see [1].) Attempts to isolate\nand compute the vortex content in the path integral at large \u03b2 have been a very active\narea of study in the last two years. (For a general view of the various approaches and\nissues involved, see [2]).\nA popular plausibility argument for confinement by vortices goes as follows. To\nestimate the vortex contribution to the expectation of a given Wilson loop, one assumes\nthat typically many thin vortices - i.e. thin compared to the physically large (\u226b 1fm2 )\nWilson loop area A - link with the Wilson loop. A simple estimate is obtained by\nsubdividing the surface spanned by the loop into n = A/a pieces of equal area a and\nassuming that a vortex piercing a given small area piece is present with probability p.\nProvided that the vortices linking with the loop at different places are independent,\nthe Wilson loop expectation is then given by\nn\nX\n\nk=0\n\nn\nk\n\n!\n\n(\u22121)k pk (1 \u2212 p)n\u2212k = (1 \u2212 2p)A/a ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhich is the desired area-law.\nIn the present paper we point out that while this simple picture indeed gives the\ncorrect area law, it is fundamentally incorrect because it is not supported by the underlying full non-Abelian gauge theory. The response of the vortex distribution in the\nvacuum to the introduction of the external probe represented by a Wilson loop should\nbe such as to minimize the effective quantum action (free energy) of the system. To\nexamine this we make the above arguments more precise by introducing a set of vortex\ncontainers linking with the Wilson loop in the spirit of [3]. Any set of vortex containers can then be used to obtain an upper bound to the Wilson loop by making use of\nrigorous inequalities mostly based on reflection positivity. We show that thick vortex\ncontainers of thickness of the order of the (shorter) side length of the Wilson loop yield\nthe 'best' and in fact the only strict area-law upper bound. This shows that vortices do\nnot have some fixed characteristic thickness but the most important vortex fluctuations\ndisordering a Wilson loop of a given size have a core thickness of the order of the linear\nsize of the Wilson loop. It also means that generally vortices cannot be unambiguously\nlocated as individual objects in every given single gauge field configuration. The only\nmeaningful quantity is the number of vortices (mod N) linking with a given Wilson\nloop, and this is a well-defined gauge invariant quantity. In the remainder of the paper\nwe show how the physical picture implied by the previous discussion leads to a simple\neffective Z(N) gauge theory for the long distance center degrees of freedom. We then\nobserve that the introduction of dynamical fermions in this effective strongly coupled\nsystem results in chiral symmetry breaking.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review and extend various\nrelations and inequalities relating the electric free energy (Fourier transform of the\n2\n\n\fvortex free energy) to the Wilson loop. These relations form the basis for our discussion\nof vortices and the emergence of a linear potential in Section 3. Section 4 further\ndiscusses the physical picture and introduces the effective theory. Section 5 contains\nsome conclusions.\n\n2\n\nElectric flux inequalities\n\nAfter a brief description of our notation, in this Section we introduce the basic electric\nflux inequalities. These are already interesting in their own right since they yield a\nrigorous upper bound on the Wilson loop in terms of the electric flux free energy.\nWe work on a hypercubic lattice \u039b of length L\u03bc in spacetime direction \u03bc = 1, . . . , d.\nWe assume the standard Wilson formulation of lattice gauge theory with SU(2) groupvalued link variables, the Wilson action and periodic boundary conditions in all directions. Expectation values of observables are defined as\n1\nhOi =\nZ\n\nZ\n\nd[U] O exp\n\n\u03b2\n\nX\np\n\n!\n\n1\ntrUp ,\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the integration is over all the group-valued link variables and Z, the partition\nfunction, is the same integral without the operator insertion O.\nLet us denote by O[V\u03bc\u03bd ] the operator that flips the sign of the coupling (introduces a\nZ(2) 'twist') on a coclosed (d\u22122)-dimensional set of plaquettes V\u03bc\u03bd winding around the\nperiodic lattice in the directions perpendicular to the \u03bc\u03bd-directions. The expectation\nvalue of this operator defines the vortex free energy:\nD\n\nE\n\nexp(\u2212Fv [\u03bc\u03bd]) = O[V\u03bc\u03bd ] .\n\n(3)\n\nThe twist amounts to a discontinuous gauge transformation with multivaluedness in\nZ(2), i.e. forces the presence of a \u03c01 (SU(2)/Z(2)) vortex wrapped around the periodic\nlattice. As indicated by the notation, the expectation depends only on the directions in\nwhich V winds through the lattice, not the exact shape or location of V. This expresses\nthe mod 2 conservation of flux. Indeed, the twist \u22121 on the plaquettes forming V can\nbe moved to the plaquettes forming any other homologous coclosed set V \u2032 by the\nchange of variables Ub \u2192 \u2212Ub in the numerator in (3) for each bond b in a set of bonds\ncobounded by V \u222a V \u2032 . By the same token (3) is invariant under changes mod 2 in the\nnumber of homologous twisted coclosed sets introduced in \u039b. A simple consequence of\nthis is that\nhO[V\u03bc\u03bd ] O[V\u03bc\u03bd\u2032 ]i = 1.\n(4)\nWe will assume that, for sufficiently large |A\u03bc\u03bd |, and dimension d \u2264 4, the vortex\nfree energy (3) behaves as\nFv [\u03bc\u03bd] \u223c (\n\nY\n\nL\u03bb ) exp( \u2212\u03c1(\u03b2) |A\u03bc\u03bd | ),\n\n\u03bb6=\u03bc\u03bd\n\n3\n\n(5)\n\n\fwhere |A\u03bc\u03bd | = L\u03bc L\u03bd . This is the optimal behavior under exponential transverse spreading (creation of mass gap) of the flux introduced by the twist on V, with \u03c1 approaching,\nat least asymptotically, the exact linear potential string tension. This behavior is expected by physical reasoning [4], and explicitly seen in the strong coupling expansion\n[5]. Recently, it became possible to demonstrate this in numerical simulations at large\n\u03b2 [6], [7]. The behavior (5) for a 'vortex in a box' is essential for our argument in the\nfollowing.\nThe Z(2) Fourier transform of (3),\nexp(\u2212Fel ) =\n\nD\n\nE\n1\n( 1 \u2212 O[V\u03bc\u03bd ] ) ,\n2\n\n(6)\n\ngives the corresponding dual (w.r.t. the center) color-electric free energy. The mod 2\nconservation of the magnetic flux is now expressed by the projection property\nD\n\nE\nD1\nE\n1\n1\n( 1 \u2212 O[V\u03bc\u03bd ] ) ( 1 \u2212 O[V\u03bc\u03bd\u2032 ] ) =\n( 1 \u2212 O[V\u03bc\u03bd ] ) ,\n2\n2\n2\n\n(7)\n\nas is easily seen by using Eq. (4).\nConsider now a rectangular Wilson loop C placed, say, in the [12]-plane. Let V be\na coclosed stack of plaquettes winding around the periodic lattice in the perpendicular\n\u03bc = 3, . . . , d directions andDthrough EC, and insert unity in the numerator in the Wilson\nloop expectation W [C] = 12 trU[C] in the form\n1\n1\n1 = ( 1 \u2212 O[V] ) + ( 1 + O[V] ) .\n2\n2\n\nThen\n1\ntrU[C]\n2\nD1\ntrU[C]\n=\n2\n\nW [C] =\n\nD\n\nE D1\n1\n( 1 \u2212 O[V] ) +\ntrU[C]\n2\n2\nE D1\n1\n( 1 \u2212 O[V] ) +\ntrU[C]\n2\n2\n\nE\n1\n( 1 + O[V] )\n2\nE\n1\n( 1 \u2212 O[V \u2032 ] )\n2\n\n(8)\n\nHere V \u2032 is another coclosed stack of plaquettes winding around the lattice in the perpendicular \u03bc = 3, . . . , d directions but not threading through C. The second equality\nin (8) is obtained by making the change of variables Ub \u2192 \u2212Ub in the second term in\nthe first equality in (8) for each bond b in a set of bonds cobounbed by V and V \u2032 . This\n'moves' the twist (-1) on the plaquettes forming V to those forming V \u2032 . This set of\nbonds necessarily involves one (or an odd number of) bond(s) on C, which results in\nthe minus sign in the second term in the second equality. (8) is represented graphically\nas\n(9)\nwhere a filled square stands for the operator 21 ( 1 \u2212 O[V] ), with V crossing the twodimensional plane containing the loop at the location of the filled square, and winding\naround the lattice in the remaining d \u2212 2 perpendicular directions.\n4\n\n\fSimple identities like (9), or (16), (17) below, serve as the starting point for deriving\nrelations between the Wilson loop and vortex free energies by use of reflection positivity. Given a reflection r about a (d \u2212 1)-dimensional lattice hyperplane, one defines\nan antilinear mapping \u03b8 on functions of the bond variables by \u03b8F [{Ub }] = F \u2217 [{Urb }].\nBy the reflection positivity properties of the LGT action [8], this induces a positive\nsemidefinite inner product on the space of configurations allowing the use of the corresponding Schwarz inequalities. Thus, starting with (9), consider a reflection about a\nd\u22121-dimensional hyperplane \u03c0 perpendicular to the 'vertical' loop legs and containing,\nsay, the top 'horizontal' leg of the loop C. One then has the inequality\n\n\u03c0\n\n1/2\n\n1/2\n\n1/2\n\n(10)\nfor the first term, and a similar statement for the second term in (9). In (10) we made\nuse of (7)4 and 12 tr1 = 1. The loop has now doubled in size along the direction of\none of its legs. Proceeding now by repeated reflections in hyperplanes containing one\nof the legs of the loop resulting from the previous reflection, and use of (7), one may\neventually completely eliminate all trU factors from the loop operator by virtue of the\nlattice periodicity. Applying this procedure to both terms on the rhs. of Eq. (9) one\nobtains [9]\nD\n\nE\n\nW [C] \u2264 2 exp(\u2212Fel )\n\n!|AC |/|A12 |\n\n,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere |AC | is the minimal area bounded by the Wilson loop. If then the vortex free\nenergy behaves as in (5), (11) implies area law for the Wilson loop.\nNote that the result (11) manifestly incorporates mod 2 conservation since of course\n(6) and (3) do. This is an important point that we now explore a bit further. Any\nmultiple factors of 12 ( 1 \u2212 O[V] ) occurring in the derivation above were eliminated by\n(7). Suppose instead that we keep a number of such factors to make contact with the\nnaive picture of a Wilson loop pierced by several independent vortices.

The result is (16), or (17), respectively.\nR\n\n3\n\nThe Wilson loop in terms of vortex containers\n\nIn this Section we introduce a set of vortex containers linking with a given Wilson\nloop. Using the relations derived in the previous Section, we obtain an upper bound\non the Wilson loop in terms of vortex fluctuations occurring in the given set of vortex\ncontainers. We then ask the question, which set of vortex containers gives the \"best\"\n(i.e. the lowest) upper bound to the Wilson loop. It turns out that the favored set of\nvortex containers has only one single thick container utilizing an area of the order of\nthe area spanned by the Wilson loop. This yields a strictly linear lower bound to the\nheavy quark potential, whereas a collection of many thin vortex containers results in\na suppression of the potential by a logarithmic factor.\nBy (7) and footnote 4, one can insert multiple 12 ( 1 \u2212 O[V] ) factors in (15), (17)\ncorresponding to a collection of coclosed sets {Vi } linking with the loop C. Imagine\nenclosing each Vi in a 'vortex container' [3], i.e. a sublattice \u039bi \u2282 \u039b containing Vi\nand wrapping around C (figure 2). Imagine integrating over the bond variables in the\n\n\u039bi\n\nC\nFigure 2: Vortex container \u039bi enclosing coclosed set of plaquettes Vi (shaded) linking\nwith Wilson loop C. d = 3, or 3-dimensional section in d = 4.\n5\n\nV \u222aV \u2032 \u223c V\nof the loop C.\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\nis topologically trivial w.r.t. the lattice T d topology, but not w.r.t. the obstruction\n\n7\n\n\finterior of each container, keeping bond variables on its boundary \u2202\u039bi fixed, and define\n(\u2212)\n\n1\nf\u039bi (U\u2202\u039bi ) =\n2\nwhere\n(\u2213)\nz\u039bi (U\u2202\u039bi )\n\n\u2261\n\nZ\n\nY\n\n1\u2212\n\n(+)\n\nz\u039bi (U\u2202\u039bi )\n\nY\n\ndUb\n\nb \u2208 \u039bi \u2212\u2202\u039bi\n\nz\u039bi (U\u2202\u039bi )\n\nexp(\n\np \u2208 \u039bi \u2212\u2202\u039bi\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(18)\n\n\u03b2\n(\u22131)Vi [p] trUp )\n2\n\n(19)\n\n(+)\n\nwith the characteristic function Vi [p] \u2261 1 if p \u2208 Vi , 0 otherwise. z\u039bi (U\u2202\u039bi ) is of course\nsimply the partition function for (the interior of) \u039bi . Then one obtains [3]:\nW [C] =\n\nD\n\n1\ntrU[C]\n2\n\nY\n\nE\n\nf\u039bi (U\u2202\u039bi ) .\n\ni\n\n(20)\n\n(13) can be rewritten in the same way:\nW [C] \u2264 2\n\nY D Y\ni\n\nk\u2208A\n\nf\u039bi k (U\u2202\u039bk )\n\u2032\n\nE1/|A\u2032 |\n\n,\n\n(21)\n\nwhere now each container \u039bk containing the coclosed set Vk is of transverse area l2 and\nwraps around the lattice in the longitudinal directions.\nNote that f\u039bi (U\u2202\u039bi ), (18), is nothing but (6) (Z(2) FT of vortex free energy) now\ndefined on a lattice \u039bi (the vortex container) with fixed (instead of periodic) b.c. in the\ntransverse directions, but still periodic b.c. in the longitudinal directions (in which the\n\u039bi 's have torus topology by construction). Vortex containers including integration over\nfluctuations (summation of entropy effects) in their interior are a convenient device for\ndiscussing scales larger than their thickness in terms of free energy costs rather than\nthe action of individual configurations.\nFrom (20) one can now, trivially, obtain the bound:\nW [C] \u2264\n\nY\ni\n\nmax |f\u039bi (U\u2202\u039bi )|,\nU\u2202\u039bi\n\n(22)\n\nwhere the maximum is taken over all values of the bond variables on the boundary\n\u2202\u039bi .\n(22) makes a direct connection with the naive notion of independent vortices winding through a large Wilson loop, resulting in disorder, and area law, provided they are\nable to grow sufficiently long to pierce through the loop at any point. For this to be\npossible the vortices must be allowed to grow sufficiently thick to keep their free energy\ncost fixed as their length increases with that of the Wilson loop. Let di be the size\nof \u039bi in each of the two directions transverse to the set Vi used in its definition; its\nlongitudinal size is given by |Vi |. We must first assume that all the vortex containers\nare thick enough to reach the regime where\n(\u2212)\n\n(+)\n\n\u2212 ln( z\u039bi (U\u2202\u039bi )/z\u039bi (U\u2202\u039bi ) ) \u223c |Vi | exp(\u2212\u03c1 d2i )\n8\n\n(23)\n\n\ffor all U\u2202\u039bi . So to keep the free energy cost of each vortex less than a fixed value f ,\nwe need\n!\n|Vi |\n1\n2\n.\n(24)\ndi \u2265 ln\n\u03c1\nf\nThen also max f\u039bi (U\u2202\u039bi ) < 21 (1 \u2212 e\u2212f ) < const. But |Vi | (in d dimensions) is of the\norder Rd\u22122 for linkage through points away from the perimeter of a rectangular loop\nof side lengths T and R, T > R. Such a loop can then accommodate \u223c RT / ln R\ncontainers wrapped around it. Thus (22) gives a confining but not quite purely linear\npotential\nV (R) \u2265 const R/ ln R .\n(25)\nThe same reasoning, and consequent failure to produce a purely linear potential,\napplies to the familiar argument for confinement by vortices, outlined in the introduction, which tacitly underlies or is implied by many discussions in the literature. One\nassumes randomly distributed vortices of a certain thickness and basically arbitrary\nlength. It is crucial that one assumes that the cost and hence the probability for vortices to link anywhere with the loop is fixed for any Wilson loop size (cp. (1)). One\nthen considers one vortex linked with a large Wilson loop. With the vortex thickness\nassumed much less than the loop's linear dimensions, one now sums over all positions\nof intersection with a surface spanning the loop. With the above assumptions, this\nproduces a factor proportional to the loop area. One then sums over all intersection\npoints for two independent vortices linking with the loop, and so on. This clearly\nexponentiates generating area law:\nW [C] \u223c 1 + (\u22121) k|AC | +\n\n((\u22121) k|AC |)2\n+ * * * = exp( \u2212k|AC | ) .\n2!\n\n(26)\n\nWe now see that purely linear confinement is obtained this way only by adopting a\nnon-interacting gas picture, and ignoring the actual free energy requirements for having\nvortices of sufficient length link anywhere with a large loop: the type of discussion just\ngiven above for (22) applies to each term in such a summation. Thus, for one vortex\nlinking with the large loop of side lengths T and R (T \u226b R), a vortex cross section area\nof order ln R is required; otherwise, linking anywhere far away from the perimeter for\nfixed, bounded vortex free energy cost f , as required by the argument, is not possible.\nThis leads at best to (25), not (26).\nThe problem arises because one treats the vortices as localized and independent.\nFor sufficiently thick vortices free energy costs are indeed correctly estimated in magnitude as above, i.e. (23). Thus, if one imagines each vortex enclosed in a vortex\ncontainer of fixed, but sufficiently large, width d, the exponential transverse spreading\n\u223c exp(\u2212\u03c1 d2 ) renders the overall vortex bulk free energy cost inside insensitive to the\nexact values of the gauge fields on the container boundary. The vortex, however, is\nsurrounded by the pure gauge long tail that encodes its nontrivial topology, and flux\nquantization. This tail incurs no additional action cost, but is of infinite range and\n9\n\n\fcommunicates the presence of nontrivial topological flux inside the container to everywhere outside. So even though the gauge field values on a thick container's boundaries\nare irrelevant for estimating the bulk free energy cost inside, they are very much relevant for signalling the presence of a vortex inside to other vortices or other topological\nobstructions outside.\nThis acts like an 'irreducible' interaction between vortices that acts at all distances,\nand enforces flux conservation mod N. This interaction allows a system of vortex\nexcitations to adjust the amount of flux spreading, i.e adjust the thickness of vortices\nto minimize the free energy of the system. The thickness of vortex cores then is not\nfixed, but is adjusted relative to their length as required by the presence of other\nvortices and/or other obstructions (e.g. Wilson loop legs) sensitive to the presence\nof topological Z(N) flux (figure 3). This means that in general vortices cannot be\nconsidered isolated, and a definite number of vortices, specified more precisely than\nmod N, cannot necessarily be unambiguously assigned to every configuration.\n\nC\n(a)\n\nC\n(b)\n\nC\n(c)\n\nFigure 3: Vortices linking with Wilson loop C. Cores shown in darker shading, and long\nrange (infinite extent) pure gauge tails in light shading: (a) Well-separated vortices of\napproximately fixed width; (b) Configurations of equivalent mod 2 flux having one\nthickened vortex lowering potential energy; (c) Configurations contributing essentially\nas in (b) showing the possible ambiguities in counting vortices beyond mod N.\nThus, in the presence of the Wilson loop source, the optimal configurations for\nthe system are not those of multiple isolated linked vortices, each of some fixed free\nenergy cost (figure 3(a)), hence length |V| \u223c R(d\u22122) and fixed width d2 \u223c ln R \u226a R, T .\nIt is more advantageous, in terms of free energy cost, for multiple linking vortices to\nthicken and merge, the total topological flux being conserved mod N (figure 3(b)).\nSince the Wilson loop operator is affected by the topological flux through it only mod\nN, this should optimize the expectation. But then the picture and expansion in terms\nof groups of isolated independent vortices (26) is no longer applicable.\n\n10\n\n\fSimilarly, (22) leads to (25) because it is obtained by assuming the vortex inside\neach container as completely isolated and independent of all the others. The exact\nexpression (20) holds for any number of factors in the product inside the expectation\n(reflecting mod N conservation). In view of the above discussion, one may as well\ncombine containers into ones as thick as possible by integrating over the boundary\nfields of neighboring containers. With T \u226b R, this amounts to taking containers in\nthe product in (20), (22) having transverse area \u223c R2 , and longitudinal extension\n\u223c (const R)(d\u22122) . (22) now gives\nV (R) \u2265 const R \u2212\n\nconst\n( ln R + const )\nR\n\n(27)\n\n>\nreplacing (25). For loops with T \u223c R, basically only one vortex container is needed,\nwhich means that strict linear potential arises essentially from thick vortex fluctuations spanning the entire loop area. It is interesting to note that such thick vortices\nalso produce nonperturbative 1/R contributions (at scales outside the short distance\nperturbation theory regime).\nInequality (22) is actually rather crude. The inequalities (11), (13) following from\nreflection positivity are much more powerful because of the exponents that allow estimates uniform in the lattice size. They give directly pure area law. As is easily seen,\nthis is true even if one further crudely bounds the r.h.s. of (13) from above as done in\n(22), since ln L\u03bc /A\u2032 \u2192 0 as |\u039b| \u2192 \u221e. There is no real reason for doing this though.6\n\n4\n\nLong range vortex fluctuations \u2013 effective theory\n\nThe above discussion, based on exact relations and inequalities between the Wilson\nloop and the free energy order parameters, indicates that an effective picture of the\nlong distance confining fluctuations as isolated, independent vortices winding over long\ndistances - in other words, as some kind of an approximately dilute or weakly interacting vortex gas - is not generally applicable. It does not take properly into account the\nrelation between length and thickness of a vortex implied by the cost in free energy\nnecessary to create the vortex in the first place, nor the correlations between vortices\ncaused by their long range (topologically nontrivial) pure gauge tails. These correlations are present irrespective of the separation and enforce the mod N conservation of\ntopological flux. Even though the cost diminishes exponentially with the transverse\nthickness of a vortex (creation of mass gap), these effects must still be properly accounted for if vortices of basically arbitrary length are to be present in the vacuum.\nThese effects then generally tend to cause neighboring thick vortices to thicken further\nand merge since this lowers the free-energy cost for the vortices (above any background\n6\n\n(13), however, might serve as a starting point for more sophisticated approximations where the\nbehavior (5) for the vortex free energy under spreading of flux is at least partially derived rather than\nassumed.\n\n11\n\n\fof fluctuations that may be present) for the same mod N total flux in the system. Thus,\nour previous discussion implies that the long distance linear potential should not properly be viewed as arising from the fluctuations caused by a gas of independent vortices\nwinding through the loop, each of thickness much less than the linear dimensions of\nthe loop. Rather, the fluctuation is more accurately described as that due to vortices\nof thickness comparable to the (shorter) linear loop dimension. Negative values of the\nloop occur then with almost exactly equal measure weight as positive values (no vortex\n(mod 2)). This optimizes the expectation to be as small as possible, i.e. exhibit exact\narea law.7\nThis reflects the striking behavior revealed by the numerical simulations [6], that\nover sufficiently large scales there is 'condensation' of vorticity carrying flux. Over a\nhypercube of side length of about 1 fm, the weighted probability at large \u03b2 for nonzero\n(mod N) flux configurations goes to unity. The weighted probability then that one finds\na vortex of at least this transverse size going through a 2-dim face on the hypercube\nboundary is approaching one. More generally, above this scale, vortices of any length,\nby corresponding appropriate adjustment in thickness, can occur at practically zero free\nenergy cost. One may view this as percolation of vortices in the following sense. If one\nconsiders any two disjoint segments on the boundary of a large 4-dimensional simply\nconnected region, the probability of being joined by a vortex of sufficient thickness (\u2265\n1 fm) is finite.\nThis picture of 'percolated' vortices in all possible [\u03bc\u03bd] orientations, with flux in\nintersections being conserved only mod 2, implies that in general it is difficult to unambiguously identify individual vortices.8 Rather, in the absence of obstructions or\nboundaries introduced by external probes, one can talk about an average nonvanishing vorticity field defined on the coarse scale of 1 fm, measured by the 'circulation'\n(plaquettes, Wilson loops) above this scale.\nWhat simple effective theory can describe this vacuum? We stress that we mean an\neffective theory strictly of only these long range vortex fluctuations (confiners) resulting\nfrom integrating out to an appropriate scale. Even at that scale there will of course\nbe all kinds of other SU(2) (SU(N)) fluctuations which we consider irrelevant for\nconfinement. Let us list the minimal requirements for the effective theory:\n(i) On a coarse scale of about l = 1 \u2212 1.2 fm, the partition function should be\nexpressible solely in terms of vortex excitations (coclosed (closed dual) surfaces\nof codim 2).\n(ii) The mod 2 (mod N) property should be manifestly incorporated.\n7\n\nRecall that it is a rigorous result that the potential cannot rise faster than linearly.\nThe way embedded non-self-interacting 2-dimensional surfaces (in our case, surfaces of a certain\nthickness) can grow to densely fill 4-dimensional space, the so called capped gropes and towers, has\nbeen extensively studied in manifold theory [10].\n8\n\n12\n\n\f(iii) The vortex flux through each coarse scale plaquette should incur an action equal\nto the vortex free energy per unit length for thickness \u223c l, as defined and computed from (3). This amount of free energy for the confiners (their action on the\ncoarser scale) is the cost above the sea of all other vacuum fluctuations. (Again,\nnote that this depends only mod 2 on the number of 'vortex-introducing' singular\ngauge transformations injected in the box in (3).)\n(iv) On this coarse lattice, the thick vortices should be in a 'percolation phase'. Thus,\ndespite (i), there should not be a useful expansion of the theory \u2013 i.e. a convergent, or, at least formally, systematic expansion scheme allowing computation of\nobservables \u2013 such that each term in the expansion is characterized by a welldefined number of vortex excitations.\n(v) The Wilson loop expectation should give strict area law as in the bound (11).\nLet then \u039bc be the coarse lattice of lattice spacing \u223c l, and \u03c7p \u2208 Z(2) variables\nresiding on its plaquettes. Then the simplest way to implement (i) above is by the\npartition sum:\nZ\n\u0011\nY\nY\nY 1\u0010\nZ \u039bc =\n1+\n\u03c7p exp Aeff .\n(28)\nd\u03c7p\nZ(2) p\nc 2\np\u2208\u2202c\nThe measure enforces the constraint\nY\n\n\u03c7p = 1\n\n(29)\n\np\u2208\u2202c\n\non the plaquettes forming the boundary of every 3-dimensional cube c on \u039bc , so only\nexcitations on coclosed sets are allowed. Equivalently, on the dual lattice, (29) assumes\nthe form\nY\n\u03c7\u2217p = 1\n(30)\np\u2208\u2202 \u2217 b\n\non the plaquettes forming the coboundary of every bond. The requirement (ii) is then\nautomatically taken care of.\nThe general form of the effective action Aeff\nAeff = \u03b2eff\n\nX\np\n\n\u03c7p + \u03b22p\n\nX\n\n\u03c7p \u03c7p\u2032 + \u03b23p\n\nX\n\n\u03c7p \u03c7p\u2032 \u03c7p\u2032\u2032 + * * *\n\n(31)\n\n(p,p\u2032 ,p\u2032\u2032 )\u2208\u2202 \u2217 b\n\n(p,p\u2032 )\u2208\u2202 \u2217 b\n\ninvolves, in addition to the basic plaquette term, quasilocal interaction terms involving\ntwo or more plaquettes in the coboundary of each bond, etc. Now, from (iii), and (5),\nwe must have\n\u03b2eff \u223c exp( \u2212\u03c1(\u03b2) l2 )\n(32)\ngiving, in principle, the coupling \u03b2eff in terms of the coupling at the original lattice\nspacing, as \u03c1 must approach the string tension for sufficiently large l. From the numerical simulations [6], l \u223c 1.1 fm. This gives \u03b2eff \u223c 0.002. This very small value reflects\n13\n\n\fof course the fact that at this choice of the physical length l vortex flux is found to\nbecome very 'light'. Correspondingly, the terms involving products of two or more\n2\nplaquettes must be of order \u03b2eff\nand higher, hence entirely negligible.\nThe effective model (28) is now seen to simply be a Z(2) LGT. Indeed, the constraint\n(29) can be explicitly solved by introducing Z(2) bond variables \u03b3b by:\n\u03c7p =\n\nY\n\n\u03b3b .\n\n(33)\n\nb\u2208\u2202p\n\nThen\nZ \u039bc =\n\nZ\n\nZ(2)\n\nY\n\n\u0010\n\nd\u03b3b exp \u03b2eff\n\nb\n\nX\n\n\u0011\n\n\u03b3\u2202p + * * * ,\n\np\n\n(34)\n\nwhere the ellipses indicate the additional clover and higher loop terms corresponding to\nthe additional terms in (31). The theory is in the deep strong coupling regime \u03b2eff \u226a 1.\nThus (iv) above is indeed satisfied. The theory can be treated in the strong coupling\nexpansion. It cannot, however, be meaningfully expanded in its vortex excitations \u2013\nthat would be appropriate in the weak coupling \u03b2eff \u226b 1 regime in the form of the\nusual weak coupling expansion for discrete groups (dilute vortex gas) [11].\nIt should perhaps be explicitly pointed out that the Z(2) variables in (28), (34),\nserve as an effective description of long distance fluctuations creating topological Z(2)\nflux (elements of \u03c01 (SU(2)/Z(2)) in the original theory [12]. They have nothing to do\nwith the Z(2) part of the original SU(2) bond variables. Note that the Z(2) gauge\ntheory interaction, together with (32), correctly reproduce the effects of flux spreading\nand thickening of vortices while conserving flux mod 2. Correspondingly, the Wilson\nloop now automatically gives the correct area law.\nThe Wilson loop in (34) represents the coupling of an external quark current to the\nlong distance confining fluctuations. Its replacement by dynamical quarks introduces\nfermions in the medium of these fluctuations. Since the effective coupling is strong, it\ninduces dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (CSB).\nCSB in strongly coupled LGT has actually been demonstrated analytically in the\nsuperstrong gauge coupling limit (no plaquette action term) by expansion or mean\nfield (large N or d) approximations [13], [14], and rigorously by infrared bounds [15].\nIt is physically obvious that the result extends to a finite region in the strong coupling\nregime.9\nWe may try to use the results in [13] - [15] to get an estimate of the contribution\nto the quark condensate in the effective theory. Corrections from the plaquette term\nin the action are totally negligible due to the smallness of \u03b2eff . One then has:\n\n9\n\nD\n\n1\nq\u0304q = z(l)N 3\nl\nE\n\ns\n\n\u00111/2\n2\u0010\n1 \u2212 k(d)\n,\nd\n\n(35)\n\nIt should be possible to prove this by cluster expansion techniques around the \u03b2 = 0 point, though\nnot so straightforward for technical reasons (bounding terms with Grassmann integrands).\n\n14\n\n\fwhere 18 \u2264 k(4) < 0.35. z(l) is some renormalization factor that, in a more sophisticated treatment, should depend on how fermions are introduced at the original lattice\nspacing. Here we naively set it equal to one \u2013 this is equivalent to Dsimply\ntaking stagE\ngered fermions on the coarse lattice. With l = 1.1 fm, this gives q\u0304q = (195 MeV)3\nfor N = 2, and (223 MeV)3 for N = 3. This indicates that the quark condensate may\nbe entirely accounted for by the long range confining fluctuations.\nFollowing our previous development, the effective Z(N) theory appears to emerge\nrather naturally, and in fact in a fairly unique manner. The idea that an effective\ntheory of long range vortex fluctuations must be a Z(N) LGT is not new, but has not,\nwe believe, been formulated in this way before. Recently, a model equivalent to (28),\nin the representation (30) and employing additive Z(2) variables, was considered in\n[16], apparently without any reference to Z(2) LGT.\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nIn the present paper we studied the energetics of how vortices can disorder Wilson\nloops of different sizes. Vortices of any thickness smaller than the linear size of a given\nWilson loop can link with it and contribute to disordering its average. Here we pointed\nout that for Wilson loops of any given size it is the vortices of \"maximal\" thickness,\ni.e. thickness of the order of the linear size of the loop, that give the most important\ncontribution resulting in an area-law suppression of large Wilson loops and a linear\nheavy quark potential. On the other hand, vortices of any fixed thickness contribute\nonly with a logarithmically suppressed term to the potential. This is in contradiction\nwith the naive picture of confinement by vortices which assumes that vortices of fixed\nthickness can link with a fixed probability with arbitrarily large Wilson loops. The\ncorrect picture must take properly into account the relation between the length and\nthickness of a vortex imposed by the free energy requirements for creating the vortex,\nas well as the interaction between vortices introduced by the constraint of mod N\nconservation of the vortex flux. This picture of vortices naturally yields a long distance\neffective Z(N) gauge theory above the confinement scale of around 1fm. The effective\ntheory is deep in the strong coupling regime which makes it impossible to interpret it in\nterms of a simple vortex gas expansion. The only useful expansion one can consider is\nthe strong coupling one. Being deep in the strong coupling regime, the effective Z(N)\ngauge theory naturally produces chiral symmetry breaking in the presence of fermion\nfields.\n\nReferences\n[1] R.W. Haymaker, Phys.

In addition to the single plaquette term, these authors introduce\nan independent 'vortex stiffness' coupling which corresponds to the clover type\nterm in the LGT above. (As we discussed, such clover and many other terms do\nindeed appear naturally on progressively larger scales as one spin-blocks to distances beyond the coarse lattice spacing l). The coefficient of this term is adjusted,\n16\n\n\fby numerical simulations, relative to that of the plaquette term. It can be sizeable\nbecause these authors introduce the effective action at a shorter coarser scale l <\n1 fm. If l \u22651 fm, as taken in this paper, this and higher terms are subdominant.\nA related question, that of the existence of stable saddle point solitons in the\neffective action at many lattice spacings, starting from the SU(2) LGT at strong\ncoupling in d = 3, was investigated in: M.
