This fascinating and central question in cosmology is currently\nbeing answered with increasing precision, thanks to outstanding measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, correlated with the study of\nlarge scale structure (LSS), of the primordial abundances\nof light elements, and many other observables in the far\nuniverse.\nOne of the most intriguing issues is to determine the\ncontributions of matter and dark energy to the total energy density (\u03a9m and \u03a9\u039b in units of the critical density).\nInflation predicts \u03a9m + \u03a9\u039b = 1 but, so far, there is no\ntheoretical prediction on the value of each of these parameters. This explains why in most cosmological parameter analyses they receive much more attention than\nthe radiation density \u03a9r , which is often assumed to be\nwell-known. However, the reference value of \u03a9r relies\non a strong theoretical prejudice: apart from the CMB\nphotons, the dominant relativistic backgound would consist of the three families of neutrinos, whose temperature\nwould be fixed with respect to the CMB temperature by\nthe standard picture of neutrino decoupling prior to Big\nBang Nucleosynthesis (BBN).\nMeasuring the energy density of radiation today is not\neasy, because it is known to be three orders of magnitude\nbelow the critical density. The main constraints come either from the very early universe, when radiation was the\ndominant source of energy, or from the observation of cosmological perturbations, which imprint the time of equality between matter and radiation. In particular, through\nBBN models, the primordial abundances of light elements\ncan be related to \u03a9r , evaluated at the time when the\nmean energy in the universe was of order 1 MeV4 \u2013 while\nthe power spectrum of photon anisotropies and of matter\ndensity carry a clear signature of the time at which \u03a9r\nbecame comparable to \u03a9m , at energies of order (0.1 eV)4 .\n\nUntil now, the BBN constraint on \u03a9r was more stringent\nthan the one from cosmological perturbations, by approximately one order of magnitude. This leaves the door\nwide open for various plausible assumptions concerning\nthe radiation content of the universe, which should not\nbe necessarily the same during BBN and at the time of\nmatter/radiation equality. For instance, a population of\nnon-relativistic particles may decay into relativistic ones,\nenhancing the radiation energy density. Moreover, the\nstandard BBN scenario itself \u2013 which is the simplest way\nto explain the formation of light elements, but not the\nonly one \u2013 needs to be tested. In this respect, the best\nwould be to have some independent measurements of the\ntwo free parameters of BBN: the baryon density \u03a9b h2\nand the radiation density \u03a9r h2 (where the reduced Hubble constant is h \u2261 H0 /(100 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 )). The later\ncontrols the expansion rate in the early universe. Some\nprecise bounds on \u03a9b h2 were already obtained from recent CMB experiments, while the determination of \u03a9r h2\nwas still quite loose, compared to BBN predictions.\nThe goal of this paper is to update this analysis and\nto show that the outstanding data from the first year\nsky survey of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe\n(WMAP) [1, 2] gives better constraints, showing increasing evidence in favor of standard BBN, and leaving very\nsmall room for extra relativistic degrees of freedom beyond the three neutrino flavors.\n\nII.\n\nTHE EFFECTIVE NUMBER OF\nRELATIVISTIC NEUTRINOS\n\nThe energy density stored in relativistic species, \u03c1r ,\nis customarily given in terms of the so-called effective\nnumber of relativistic neutrino species Neff (see [3] for a\n\n\f2\nreview and references), through the relation\n#\n\"\n\u0012 \u00134/3\n7 4\nNeff \u03c1\u03b3 ,\n\u03c1r = \u03c1\u03b3 + \u03c1\u03bd + \u03c1x = 1 +\n8 11\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c1\u03b3 is the energy density of photons, whose value\ntoday is known from the measurement of the CMB temperature. Eq. (1) can be also written as\n!\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c10\u03b3\n\u03c1r \u2212 \u03c1\u03b3\nNeff \u2261\n,\n(2)\n\u03c10\u03bd\n\u03c1\u03b3\nwhere \u03c10\u03bd denotes the energy density of a single species of\nmassless neutrino with an equilibrium Fermi-Dirac distribution with zero chemical potential, and \u03c10\u03b3 is the photon energy density in the approximation of instantaneous\nneutrino decoupling. The normalization of Neff is such\nthat it gives Neff = 3 in the standard case of three flavors of massless neutrinos, again in the limit of instantaneous decoupling. In principle Neff includes, in addition\nto the standard neutrinos, a potential contribution \u03c1x\nfrom other relativistic relics such as majorons or sterile\nneutrinos.\nIt turns out that even in the standard case of three neutrino flavors the effective number of relativistic neutrino\nspecies is not exactly 3. The decoupling of neutrinos from\nthe rest of the primordial plasma occurs at a temperature\nof 2\u22123 MeV, not far from temperatures of order the electron mass at which electron\u2013positron annihilations transfer their entropy into photons, causing the well-known\ndifference between the temperatures of relic photons and\n1/3\nrelic neutrinos, T /T\u03bd = (11/4)\n(see e.g. [4]). Accurate\ncalculations [5, 6, 7] have shown that neutrinos are still\nslightly interacting with e\u00b1 , thus sharing a small part of\nthe entropy release. This causes a momentum dependent\ndistortion in the neutrino spectra from the equilibrium\nFermi\u2013Dirac behavior and a slightly smaller T /T\u03bd ratio.\nBoth effects lead to a value of Neff = 3.034. A further,\nthough smaller, effect on T /T\u03bd is induced by finite temperature Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) corrections\nto the electromagnetic plasma [8, 9]. A recent combined\nstudy of the incomplete neutrino decoupling and QED\ncorrections concluded that the total effect corresponds\nto Neff = 3.0395 \u2243 3.04 [10]. Therefore we define the\nextra energy density in radiation form as\n\u2206Neff \u2261 Neff \u2212 3.04 .\n\n(3)\n\nThe standard value of Neff corresponds to the case of\nmassless or very light neutrinos, i.e. those with masses\nmuch smaller than 1 eV. More massive neutrinos affect\nthe late avolution of the universe in a way that can not\nbe parametrized with a \u2206Neff . However, the recent evidences of flavor neutrino oscillations in atmospheric and\nsolar neutrinos, in particular after the recent KamLAND\ndata show that the neutrino masses are not large enough,\nexcept in the case when the three mass eigenstates are\ndegenerate (see e.g. [11] for a recent review). We do not\n\nconsider such a case in the present paper, but assume\nthat the neutrino mass scheme\np is hierarchical, with the\nlargest mass of order m\u03bd \u2243 \u2206m2atm \u223c 0.05 eV.\nThe value of \u2206Neff is constrained at the BBN epoch\nfrom the comparison of theoretical predictions and experimental data on the primordial abundances of light elements. Typically, the BBN bounds are of order \u2206Neff <\n0.4 \u2212 1 [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Independent bounds on the\nradiation content of the universe can be extracted from\nthe analysis of the power spectrum of CMB anisotropies.\nAn enhanced contribution of relativistic particles delays\nthe epoch of matter-radiation equality, which in turn increases the early integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. Basically\nthis leads to more power around the scale of the first\nCMB peak. Previous analyses found weak bounds on\n\u2206Neff [17, 18, 19, 20, 21], that can be significantly improved by adding priors on the age of the universe or by\nincluding supernovae and LSS data [22]. One of the most\nrecent bounds on Neff , from a combination of CMB and\nPSCz data [20], is Neff = 6+8\n\u22124.5 (95% CL). Thus these\nbounds were not as restrictive as those from BBN. However, the precise measurements of WMAP (and those of\nPLANCK in the near future) are going to significantly\nimprove the CMB constraint on \u2206Neff , as shown in various forecast analyses (see for instance [23, 24, 25]) and\nin the calculations of this paper (see section IV).\nMany extensions of the Standard Model of particle\nphysics predict additional relativistic degrees of freedom\nthat will contribute to \u2206Neff . There exist models with\n4 neutrinos which include an additional sterile neutrino\nin order to explain the third experimental indication of\nneutrino oscillations (the LSND results). It was shown\nin many studies (see for instance [26, 27]) that all four\nneutrino models, both of 2+2 and 3+1 type, lead to a full\nthermalization of the sterile neutrino flavor before BBN,\nand thus to \u2206Neff \u2243 1, a value disfavored in the standard\nminimal model of BBN. Moreover, in these models there\nexists at least one neutrino state with mass of order 1\neV.\nIt is also possible that the relativistic degrees of freedom at the BBN and CMB epochs differ, for instance\nbecause of particle decays which increase the photon temperature relative to the neutrino one [28]. In some situations \u2206Neff can be effectively negative at BBN, such as\nthe case of a distortion in the \u03bde or \u03bd\u0304e spectra [29, 30],\nor a very low reheating scenario [31].\nA non-standard case that has been considered many\ntimes in the past is the existence of relic neutrino asymmetries, namely when the number of neutrinos and antineutrinos of the same flavor is significantly different.\nThese so-called degenerate neutrinos are described by a\ndimensionless chemical potential \u03be\u03b1 = \u03bc\u03bd\u03b1 /T , and it has\nbeen shown that the neutrino energy density always increases for any value \u03be\u03b1 6= 0\n\"\n#\nX 30 \u0012 \u03be\u03b1 \u00132 15 \u0012 \u03be\u03b1 \u00134\n\u2206Neff =\n(4)\n+\n7\n\u03c0\n7\n\u03c0\n\u03b1\nInterestingly, some combinations of pairs (\u03bee , \u03be\u03bc,\u03c4 ) could\n\n\fstill produce the primordial abundances of light elements\nfor a larger baryon asymmetry, in the so-called degenerate BBN scenario [32]. At the same time, the weaker\nCMB bounds on \u03be\u03bd are flavor blind [24, 33]. However,\nit was recently shown that for neutrino oscillation parameters in the regions favored by atmospheric and solar\nneutrino data flavor equilibrium between all active neutrino species is established well before the BBN epoch\n[34, 35, 36]. Thus the stringent BBN bounds on \u03bee apply to all flavors, so that the contribution of a potential\nrelic neutrino asymmetry to \u2206Neff is limited to very low\nvalues.\n\nprobability\n\n3\n\n-3\nIII.\n\n-2\n\nMETHOD\n\nUsing the cmbfast code [37], we computed the cosmological perturbations (temperature and polarization\n(T,E,T E)\nanisotropies Cl\n, matter power spectrum P (k)) for\na grid of models with the following parameters: baryon\ndensity \u03c9b = \u03a9b h2 , cold dark matter density \u03c9cdm =\n\u03a9cdm h2 , hubble parameter h, scalar tilt ns , optical depth\nto reionization \u03c4 , global normalization \u2013 which is not discretized \u2013 and of course an additional contribution from\nrelativistic particles \u2206Neff . We include corrections to\nthe CMB spectra from gravitational lensing [38], as computed by cmbfast. Apart from \u2206Neff , our set of parameters is the simplest one used by the WMAP team in\ntheir parameter analysis [2], and accounts very well for\nthe first year WMAP data. We restrict ourselves to a\nflat universe: since the curvature is known to be small\nfrom the position of the first CMB peak, we adopt the\ntheoretical prejudice that the universe is exactly flat, as\npredicted by inflation, rather than almost flat. Therefore, \u03a9\u039b is equal to 1 \u2212 (\u03c9b + \u03c9cdm )/h2 . Allowing for\na small curvature could alter our results by a few percent. We also neglect the possible contribution of gravitational waves and a possible scale-dependent tilt. A\nrunning tilt, in favor of which the WMAP collaboration\nfinds some marginal evidence, would not change our predictions based on WMAP alone, because the later does\nnot constrain the primordial spectrum on a wide enough\nrange of scales. However, it could slightly alter our results based on CMB and LSS data.\nOur grid covers the following ranges: 0.019 < \u03c9b <\n0.028, 0.065 < \u03c9cdm < 0.27, 0.5 < h < 0.9, 0.8 < ns <\n1.28, 0 < \u03c4 < 0.5, \u22123 < \u2206Neff < 5. We analyze it using\nan interpolation and minimization routine developed at\nLAPTH. Our code performs a multi-dimensional interpolation for each value of Cl or P (k) in order to obtain the\nspectrum at any arbitrary point, and then, computes the\nlikelihood of the model. For WMAP, the likelihood is calculated using the software kindly provided at the NASA\nweb site [39], and explained in [40]. We will also define\na combined likelihood including the pre\u2013WMAP CMB\ndata compilation by Wang et al. [41] (which is still useful for constraining high multipoles), and the LSS data\nderived by Percival et al.

The step of \u2206Neff in our grid of models is 0.5.\n\nk < 0.15 h Mpc\u22121 ) from the 2dF redshift survey [43]. For\nthese two data sets, we use window functions and correlation matrices available from [44, 45]. We constrain each\nfree parameter using a Bayesian approach: the 68% (resp.\n95%) confidence limits are defined as the values for which\nthe marginalized likelihood drops by exp[\u2212(\u03c720 \u2212 1)/2]\n(resp. exp[\u2212(\u03c720 \u2212 4)/2]), where \u03c720 is the best chi-square\nvalue in the whole parameter space.\n\nIV.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nWe start the analysis using only the first year WMAP\ntemperature and polarization data, plus a weak prior\n0.5 < h < 0.9, which is implicit from the limitation of the grid. We checked that for \u2206Neff = 0,\nwe find the same bounds as the WMAP collaboration,\nwith a minimal effective chi square \u03c72eff = 1431.5 for\n1342 effective degrees of freedom (d.o.f.). The best\nfit over our whole grid has (\u2206Neff , \u03c9b , h, \u03c9cdm, \u03c4, ns ) =\n(\u22120.9, 0.024, 0.68, 0.10, 0.16, 0.97), and a \u03c72 value which\nis not significantly lower (\u03c72eff = 1431.1 for 1341 d.o.f.),\nshowing that a non\u2013zero \u2206Neff is not required in order to improve the goodness of fit. At the 95% confidence level (CL), we can derive only an upper bound\n\u2206Neff < 6, which is impressively smaller than the previous bound from CMB only, \u2206Neff < 14 [20, 25]. At\nthe 1-\u03c3 level, the extra relativistic energy density is limited to the range \u22122.2 < \u2206Neff < 1.2, corresponding\nto a dispersion of 3.4. This is in nice agreement with\nthe prediction from [25] that with the full WMAP data,\none would reach a dispersion of 3.17. The analysis reveals that the indetermination of this parameter is caused\nmainly by a degeneracy with h, as shown in previous\nworks. When \u2206Neff runs from -3 to 6, the best-fit value\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 2: The two-dimensional confidence limits on (\u2206Neff ,\nh), based on CMB and LSS data, at the 1-\u03c3 (dark blue) and\n2-\u03c3 (light blue) levels.

After \u2206Neff = 6, the weak\nprior h < 0.9 is saturated, and the probability drops\nabruptly.\nIn order to remove the degeneracy, we add to the definition of the effective \u03c72 a gaussian prior on h derived\nfrom the HST Key Project [46], h = 0.72 \u00b1 0.08 (at the\n1-\u03c3 level). This prior is sufficient to reduce significantly\nthe 95% allowed window: \u22122.6 < \u2206Neff < 4.0. The no\nneutrino case with \u2206Neff = \u22123 is compatible with the\ndata only beyond 99% CL. The best-fit model has still\na slightly negative \u2206Neff = \u22120.7, but this is not statistically significant. The best \u03c72eff does not change very\nmuch (1431.1 for 1342 d.o.f.) because WMAP alone is in\nremarkable agreement with the Key Project value [2].\nFinally, when we include the pre-WMAP data compilation and the 2dF redshift survey (i.e., information on the\nthird and fourth CMB peak, and on the scale of the turn\u2013\n\n[1] C.L. Bennett et al., astro-ph/0302207.\n[2] D.N. Spergel et al., astro-ph/0302209.\n\nover in the matter power spectrum), the window tends\nto shift a little bit towards positive values of \u2206Neff . The\nbest-fit model has \u2206Neff = 0.5 and \u03c72eff = 1492 for 1396\nd.o.f. The 95% allowed window is \u22121.6 < \u2206Neff < 3.8.\nUsing all data, we find that the no neutrino case is excluded at 99.9% CL, which constitutes a clear indication\nof the presence of relic background neutrinos, already\nshown by pre-WMAP data [20].\nNote that throughout the analysis, we did not include\nany constraint from supernovae data. This is because all\ngood\u2013fitting models have naturally (\u03a9m , \u03a9\u039b ) very close\nto (0.3, 0.7). So, adding a supernovae prior would be\ncompletely irrelevant - unlike the h prior, which plays\na crucial role in removing the degeneracy with \u2206Neff .\nIn order to emphasize this last point, we show in figure 2 the two-dimensional 1-\u03c3 and 2-\u03c3 confidence limits\nin (\u2206Neff , h) parameter space. The contours are based\nonly on the CMB and LSS data (the HST Key Project\nresult is just superimposed as a yellow stripe). The degeneracy between these two parameters clearly appears,\nshowing that any improvement in the direct determination of h will be crucial for closing the \u2206Neff allowed\nwindow. For instance, large deviations from the standard\nvalue \u2206Neff = 0 would be excluded if h were measured to\nbe very close to 0.70, while h > 0.75 would bring strong\nevidence for extra relativistic species.\nTo summarize, we show in table I the best fit values\nand 2-\u03c3 (95% CL) limits on \u2206Neff for the three different\ndata sets. Our results show that the first year results\nof WMAP significantly improve the bounds on an\nadditional contribution to the radiation density of the\nuniverse. In the near future, the updated data from\nWMAP and the new results from the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey [47] should allow for an even better determination, providing a high-precision test of primordial\nnucleosynthesis.\nNote added: After the submission of this work, our\nresults were confirmed in refs. [48] (with a generalization\nof the bounds to a non-flat Universe) and [49].\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe are grateful to the WMAP collaboration for providing a user-friendly access to their data, and in particular\nto Licia Verde for her very useful comments.
