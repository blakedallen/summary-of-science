Rather than using the\nnon-interacting basis, we choose as a reference state the\nn-electron dot with spin S = 0 (n even) and work in its\nHF basis. We then consider the addition energies and the\nenergy differences between various spin configurations in\nKoopmans' limit where the single-particle wave functions\ndo not change [17]. Previously, Koopmans' approach was\ndiscussed for dots with spinless electrons [7] and was used\nto study spectral scrambling [18]. Here we derive the\ngeneric statistics of the spin and peak spacings, assuming\nthat the HF levels of the reference state satisfy statistics\ntypical of a diffusive or chaotic dot. The theory is valid\nfor large g, and for g \u2192 \u221e it reduces to the universal\nHamiltonian [14]. For finite g, we include fluctuations\nof the diagonal matrix elements to leading order in 1/g.\nCompared with the approach of Ref. [12], our theory requires the statistics of only a few levels around the Fermi\nenergy, and some of its results are qualitatively different.\nThe Hamiltonian of the quantum dot in the \"disorder\"\nbasis |i \u03c3i = a\u2020i\u03c3 |0i (i denotes a spatial orbit and \u03c3 = \u00b11\nis the spin variable) is given by\n\nWe use a Hartree-Fock-Koopmans approach to study spin\nand interaction effects in a diffusive or chaotic quantum dot.\nIn particular, we derive the statistics of the spacings between\nsuccessive Coulomb-blockade peaks. We include fluctuations\nof the matrix elements of the two-body screened interaction,\nsurface-charge potential, and confining potential to leading\norder in the inverse Thouless conductance. The calculated\npeak-spacing distribution is compared with experimental results.\n\nThe traditional description of Coulomb blockade in\nquantum dots has been the constant-interaction (CI)\nmodel, in which the electrons occupy single-particle levels in a confining potential, and the interaction is taken\nas a constant charging energy. In dots with chaotic dynamics, the fluctuations of the single-particle levels and\nwave functions can be described by random-matrix theory (RMT). The CI plus RMT model was successful in\ndescribing some of the observed statistical properties of\nsuch dots, e.g., the conductance peak-height distribution\n[1,2]. However, several experiments have demonstrated\nthat other statistics, such as the distribution of the spacing between Coulomb-blockade peaks, are affected by\nelectron-electron interactions [3,4,5,6].\nAt low temperatures the peak spacing is given by the\nsecond-order difference of the ground-state energy versus\nthe number of electrons. In the CI model and for spindegenerate levels, the peak-spacing distribution is bimodal, i.e., a superposition of a \u03b4 function and a (shifted)\nWigner-Dyson distribution. However, none of the measured distributions are bimodal and they all deviate from\nWigner-Dyson statistics [3,4,5,6].\nIn the spinless case, exact diagonalization for a small\nnumber of electrons [3], Hartree-Fock (HF) [7] and density functional [8] calculations, as well as a random interaction matrix model [9] explained the deviation from\nWigner-Dyson statistics as an interaction effect. Spin\ndegrees of freedom were included using exact diagonalization for dots with a small number of electrons and\nsmall values of the Thouless conductance g [10]. Spin\neffects were studied in the limit g \u2192 \u221e [11,12,13] using the so-called universal Hamiltonian [14,15]. Interaction effects (in the presence of a magnetic field) were\nincluded using a Strutinsky approach for quantum dots\n[12]. The resulting distributions showed qualitative differences when compared with experiments. Temperature\neffects were shown to be important at temperatures as\nlow as T \u223c 0.1 \u2212 0.2\u2206 [13] (\u2206 is the mean spacing between spin-degenerate levels). The spacing statistics were\n\nH=\n\nX\n\n(0)\n\n\u01ebi a\u2020i\u03c3 ai\u03c3 +\n\ni\u03c3\n\n1X\nvij;kl a\u2020i\u03c3 a\u2020j\u03c3\u2032 al\u03c3\u2032 ak\u03c3 ,\n2 ijkl\n\n(1)\n\n\u03c3\u03c3\u2032\n\n(0)\n\nwhere \u01ebi are the single-particle energies and vij;kl are\nthe (spin-independent) matrix elements of the Coulomb\ninteraction. The Hamiltonian (1) can be solved in the HF\napproximation. For each value of the spin projection Sz ,\nwe use Slater determinants with n+ (n\u2212 ) spin up (down)\n(n)\norbitals. Usually, the HF single-particle energies \u01eb\u03b1\u03c3 and\norbitals \u03c6\u03b1\u03c3 depend on the spin \u03c3. However for even n,\n(n)\nthe HF equations have a solution where \u01eb\u03b1 and \u03c6\u03b1 are\nindependent of \u03c3, and the lowest n/2 levels are doubly\noccupied. Such a Slater determinant has good S = 0.\nWe choose this solution as our reference state, and work\nin its HF basis |\u03b1i.

Assuming Koopmans' limit, we can express\n\u03b4En+1 (S) in terms of the HF levels and matrix elements\nof the reference state (n, S = 0). For example\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\nA\n\u03b4En+1 (S = 3/2) = (\u01eb2 \u2212 \u01eb0 ) \u2212 v10 \u2212 v20 + v21\n.\n\n(4)\n\n\u03bcn+1 = \u03bcn+1 (0 \u2192 1/2) + \u03b4En+1 (Sn+1 ) \u2212 \u03b4En (Sn ) , (5)\n(n)\n\nwhere in Koopmans' limit \u03bcn+1 (0 \u2192 1/2) = \u01eb1 .\nThe spacing \u22062 between successive peaks is given by\nthe difference in addition energies. We have to distinguish between even-odd-even (\"odd\") and odd-even-odd\n(\"even\") transitions (in particle number). We consider\nhere the odd transition n \u2192 n + 1 \u2192 n + 2 (n even),\nfor which \u22062 = \u03bcn+2 \u2212 \u03bcn+1 (similar results can be\nderived for the even transition [19]). \u03bcn+1 is given by\n(5) and \u03bcn+2 is calculated from \u03bcn+2 = \u03bcn+2 (1/2 \u2192\n0) + \u03b4En+2 (Sn+2 ) \u2212 \u03b4En+1 (Sn+1 ) with \u03bcn+2 (1/2 \u2192 0) =\n(n)\n\u01eb1 + v11 . \u03b4En+1 (S) is given by, e.g., Eq.

The gap distribution is then a convolution of\na Wigner-Dyson distribution with a Gaussian describing\nA\nthe distribution of v01\n+ v01 \u2212 v11 (see below).\nWe apply our HF-Koopmans approach in a restricted\nsingle-particle space of \u223c g levels around the Fermi energy. The long-range bare Coulomb interaction should\nthen be replaced by an effective interaction. In the limit\nrs << 1 we employ an effective RPA interaction calculated by excluding particle-hole transitions within the\nabove strip of \u223c g levels [15]. This effective interaction\nis v(r 1 , r2 ) = e2 /C + v\u03ba (r 1 , r 2 ) + V (r 1 ) + V (r 2 ), where\nv\u03ba (r 1 , r 2 ) is a two-body screened interaction in the dot,\nand V (r) is a one-body potential generated by the accumulation of surface charge in the finite dot [20].\nWe decompose the interaction in (2) into its average\nand fluctuating parts, and denote by Ud = v\u0304\u03b1\u03b2 and\nex\nJs = v\u0304\u03b1\u03b2\n(\u03b1 6= \u03b2) the average values of the direct and exchange interaction, respectively.

We label by \u03b1 = 0 the last occupied level of the\nS = 0 state. The lowest energy state for each spin S is\nobtained by promoting S spin down electrons from \u03b1 =\n0, . . . , \u2212(S \u2212 1) to spin up electrons in \u03b1 = 1, . . . , S. The\nresulting Slater determinant describes a maximal spin\nprojection state Sz = S and has good spin S. Using\n(2), the energy difference \u03b4En (S) \u2261 En (S) \u2212 En (S = 0)\nbetween the lowest states with spin S and spin S = 0 can\n(n)\nbe written in terms of \u01eb\u03b1 and a few matrix elements.

The spectrum is assumed to follow\nRMT within g levels around the Fermi energy, and the\nmatrix elements are uncorrelated from the single-particle\n(n)\n(n)\nspectrum. An exception is the gap \u01eb1 \u2212 \u01eb0 . We find\nits statistics by comparing the single-particle spectrum\nof the (n + 2)-electron dot with the spectrum of the nelectron dot (both in their S = 0 configuration). We have\n\nFIG. 1. Statistics in the absence of fluctuations of the interaction matrix elements. The probabilities of various spin\nvalues S are shown versus Js . The solid (dashed) lines describe the orthogonal (unitary) symmetry. Inset: the standard deviation of the peak spacing \u03c3(\u22062 ) versus Js for the\neven, odd and combined (\"total\") transitions. Js and \u03c3(\u22062 )\nare measured in units of \u2206.\n\nKoopmans' limit is exact when the fluctuations of the\n2\n\n\f\u03ba = 2\u03c0e2 \u03bd/\u01eb is the inverse screening length in 2D and\n\u01eb is the\nP dielectric constant [20]. We then find c1 =\n2\u22121/2 [ m6=0 sin2 x0,m /(x40,m J02 (x0,m ))]1/2 \u2248 0.087 [19].\nThe above results can be generalized to a ballistic\ndot, using the ballistic supersymmetric \u03c3 model obtained\nwhen a weak disorder with finite correlation length is\nadded [26]. In particular, if the Lyapunov length of this\nsmooth disorder is smaller than the dot's size, relations\nsimilar to Eqs. (8) and (10) can be derived but with the\nballistic propagator \u03a0B replacing the diffusive propagator \u03a0 in Eqs. (9) and (11). For a circular dot we define\nthe ballistic Thouless conductance from the inverse time\nit takes to cross the diameter 2R of the dot, leading to\ng = \u03c0kF R/2 = \u03c0(n/2)1/2 (n is the number of electrons\nin the dot). In the ballistic case\n\nmatrix elements are ignored, and our calculations of \u22062\nreduce to those in Ref. [11], i.e., they can be derived directly from an Hamiltonian that consists of a random\none-body part plus an average interaction (7). In the\nlimit g \u2192 \u221e this Hamiltonian is just the universal Hamiltonian with Js = \u2206/2 [14,15]. A better estimate of Js\ncan be obtained in RPA [11]; it increases monotonically\nwith rs but remains below \u2206/2.\nIn the simple limit (7), the spin and spacing distributions are determined by a single parameter Js /\u2206 [11].\nThis limit is demonstrated in Fig. 1 where we show the\nprobabilities of various spin values versus Js . The inset\nshows the standard deviation of \u22062 versus Js for the even\nand odd transitions as well as the combined one (\"total\").\nNext we discuss the fluctuations of the interaction matrix elements [20,24], which are approximately Gaussian\nvariables. We discuss separately the bulk screened interaction and surface-charge potential. Using the diagrammatic approach for the two-body screened interaction, we\nhave, for rs \u226a 1 and to leading order in 1/g\n\u221a\n\u221a\nex\n) = 2\u03c32 ; \u03c3(v\u03b1\u03b1 ) = 2 2\u03c32\nGOE : \u03c3(v\u03b1\u03b2 ) = 2\u03c32 ; \u03c3(v\u03b1\u03b2\n\u221a\nex\nGUE : \u03c3(v\u03b1\u03b2 ) = \u03c32 ; \u03c3(v\u03b1\u03b2\n) = \u03c32 ; \u03c3(v\u03b1\u03b1 ) = 2\u03c32 .

The corresponding contribution needs to be renormalized such that its integral over\nr1 (or r 2 ) vanishes [28]. The remaining part of \u03a0B involves single or multiple scattering from the boundaries\nand calculating it requires knowledge of the semiclassical\ndynamics. It can be calculated analytically for a circular billiard with diffusive boundary scattering [28]. Using\nthis model, we estimate c\u20322 = 0.81 [19]. A similar estimate\nof (11) gives c1 = 0.123.\nWe have studied the effects of fluctuations of the interaction matrix elements on the peak-spacing distribution.\nIn Fig. 2 we show the standard deviation \u03c3(\u22062 ) versus\n\u03c31 (Js = 0.3\u2206 and \u03c32 = 0.05\u2206) for the orthogonal (solid\nlines) and unitary (dashed lines) symmetries. \u03c3(\u22062 ) increases with \u03c31 and it does so faster in the odd case.\n\nDifferent matrix elements (including the direct v\u03b1\u03b2 and\nex\nexchange v\u03b1\u03b2\n) are uncorrelated. We note that the coefficients of \u03c31 and \u03c32 in Eqs. (8) are different from those\nobtained for a zero-range interaction [25]. The parameter\n\u03c32 is given by\n\u0014\n\u00151/2\nZ\nZ\n\u03c32 = A\u22122 dr 1 dr 2 \u03a02 (r1 , r2 )\n= c2 \u2206/g , (9)\nwhere c2 is a geometry-dependent coefficient. For a disk\nof radius R and boundary conditions\nnorP of vanishing\n1/2\n]\n\u2248\n0.67\nmal derivative, we find [19] c2 = 2[ l,m x\u22124\nl,m\nwhere xl,m are the zeros of Jl\u2032 (x) (Jl is the Bessel function\nof order l) and g\u2206 = 2\u03c0h\u0304D/R2 (D being the diffusion\nconstant). Since only a few matrix elements contribute\nto the peak spacing, the contribution of the two-body\nscreened interaction is parametrically of the order \u2206/g,\n\u221a\nunlike the \u2206/ g dependence found in Ref. [12].\nThe surface-charge contribution to an interaction\nmaR\ntrix element is v\u03b1\u03b2 = V\u03b1 +V\u03b2 , where V\u03b1 \u2261 |\u03c8\u03b1 (r)|2 V (r)\nis a diagonal matrix element of the surface-charge potential. We have\n\u03c3(V\u03b1 ) = (2/\u03b2)1/2 \u03c31 ; V\u03b1 V\u03b2 \u2212 V\u03b1 V\u03b2 \u2248 0 ,\n\neven\n\n\u03c3(\u22062)\n\n0.7\n\n0.5\n\neven\n\ntotal\n0.3\n\nodd\n\ntotal\nodd\n\n(10)\n\n0.1\n\nwhere\n\u0014\n\u00151/2\nZ\nZ\n\u03c31 = A\u22122 dr1 dr 2 V (r 1 )\u03a0(r 1 , r2 )V (r 2 )\n\u221a\n(11)\n= c1 \u2206/ g .\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n\u03c31\n\n0.15\n\nFIG. 2. The standard deviation \u03c3(\u22062 ) versus the standard\ndeviation \u03c31 of the surface-charge potential for Js = 0.3\u2206\nand \u03c32 = 0.05\u2206. The solid and dashed lines describe the\northogonal and unitary symmetries, respectively.\n\nFor an isolated two-dimensional (2D) circular disk of\nradius R, the surface-charge potential can be approximated by V (r) = \u2212(e2 /2\u03ba\u01ebR)(R2 \u2212 r2 )\u22121/2 , where\n\nFig. 3 shows typical peak-spacing distributions for\nboth the orthogonal (left) and unitary (right) symmetries\n3\n\n\ffor \u03c32 = 0.025\u2206 and \u03c31 = 0, 0.03\u2206 and 0.06\u2206. Signatures of the bimodality can still be observed for \u03c31 = 0\nbut they disappear at \u03c31 = 0.03\u2206. Nevertheless, the\ndistributions remain asymmetric (more so in the unitary\ncase).\nAn additional contribution to the fluctuations of \u22062\narises from the variation of the gate voltage between\npeaks. In general, the change of the gate voltage between two peaks leads to a spatially non-uniform change\nU (r) = \u2212V (r)+ \u1e7c (r) in the confining potential, where \u1e7c\noriginates in the mutual dot-gate capacitance [15]. This\nleads to scrambling of the HF levels between peaks. For\nexample, let us consider the odd transition. As the gate\nvoltage changes between Vgn+1 and Vgn+2 , the reference\nR\n(n)\n(n)\nHF levels \u01eb\u03b1 change by \u03b4\u01eb\u03b1 \u2248 U\u03b1 = dr|\u03c8\u03b1 (r)|2 U (r).\n(n)\n(n)\nWe therefore substitute \u01eb\u03b1 \u2192 \u01eb\u03b1 + U\u03b1 in the calculation of \u03bcn+2 and in Eq. (6) (\u03bcn+1 is unchanged and\ncalculated from Eq. (5)). This level scrambling can also\nlead to spin rearrangement in the dot. The ground-state\nspin of the n + 1-electron dot at gate voltage Vgn+2 (just\nbelow the transition) is found from (6) (and its generalization to higher values of S) after the substitution\n(n)\n(n)\n\u01eb\u03b1 \u2192 \u01eb\u03b1 + U\u03b1 .\nGOE\n\nodd\neven\ntotal\n\nGUE\n\n2\n\nP(\u22062\u2212<\u22062>)\n\n4\n\nthe effect of excited states and in particular the contribution from both lowest S = 0 and S = 1 states [19].\nWe model the gate-voltage scrambling by a potential \u1e7c\nwhose matrix elements are uncorrelated from the matrix\nelements of V and have the same variance. It is difficult\nto estimate \u03c31 and \u03c32 for the ballistic dot used in the experiment. The simple estimates based on a billiard with\ndiffusive surface scattering (see the second paragraph after Eq. (11)) for n \u2248 340 electrons (i.e., g \u2248 41) give\n\u03c31 = 0.02\u2206 and \u03c32 = 0.04\u2206. Fig. 4 compares the experimental distribution of Ref. [5] in the presence of a magnetic field (solid histograms) with the corresponding theoretical distribution (dashed histograms) that includes an\nexperimental noise of 0.1\u2206. The theoretical distribution\ndescribes rather well the asymmetry of the experimental\ndistribution and its width 0.27 \u2206 is slightly below the experimental width of (0.29 \u00b1 0.03)\u2206. In chaotic billiards\nour estimates of \u03c31 and \u03c32 can be enhanced by up to a\nfactor of 2 and lead to better agreement with the data.\n\n\u03c31=0\n\n\u03c31=0\n\nP(\u22062\u2212Ud)\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n1\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0.5\n\n\u22062\u2212Ud\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\n0.5\n\u22062\u2212<\u22062>\n\n1\n\n\u03c31=0.03\n\nFIG. 4.

In particular we have studied\nthe dependence of the peak-spacing distribution on the\nfluctuations of the interaction matrix elements to leading\norder in the inverse Thouless conductance.
