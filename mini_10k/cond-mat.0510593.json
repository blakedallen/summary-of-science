Introduction.\nReplacement of copper wires with superconductors can result in substantial\nreductions in the size and weight of high power transformers, motors and generators[14]. The maximum benefit of such reduction can potentially be achieved in a fully\nsuperconducting (all-cryogenic) machine where both stator and rotor windings are\nsuperconducting. The main obstacle to the implementation of such designs is the very\nlarge ac loss that would occur in the superconducting armature winding because it is\nsubjected to an alternating magnetic field [5-11].\nThis problem is especially acute in the second generation YBa2Cu3O6+x (YBCO)\ncoated conductors that are produced in the form of wide, thin tapes [12-16]. A way to\n\n\f2\nreduce the hysteresis loss in such tapes by dividing them into a large number of parallel\nstripes segregated by non-superconducting resistive barriers was proposed in Refs.\n[17,18]. An experiment on small samples of YBCO films deposited on LaAlO3 substrate\nhas confirmed the validity of that suggestion [19].\nMeasurements of the magnetization losses in actual multifilamentary YBCO coated\nsuperconductors have also been reported recently[20-22]. In Refs.[20,22] two 1 x 10 cm\nsamples of YBCO coated conductor, one control and the other striated, were subjected to\na magnetic field normal to the wide face of the tape and varying at different linear\nfrequencies f in the range 11-170 Hz with a magnetic induction amplitude B up to 70 mT.\nThe relatively long samples and measurements at several frequencies enabled the study of\nboth hysteresis and coupling losses. The combined loss in the multifilament conductor\nwas reduced by about 90% in comparison with the uniform conductor at full field\npenetration at sweep rate Bf as high as 3T/s [22].\nThis straightforward solution of the ac loss problem is not without serious\ndrawbacks. One of them is lack of connectivity, i.e. the ability of superconducting stripes\nto share supercurrent should one of them become blocked, temporarily or permanently,\nby a localized defect or a \"hot spot.\" The origin of defects may be the misalignment of\nthe grains in thin superconducting films, as well as the inevitable defects appearing in the\nconductor during its manufacturing and exploitation - mechanical stresses, spontaneously\noverheated areas, etc. In a striated tape without current sharing between the stripes these\ndefects lead to cumulative degradation of the current-carrying capacity of the long\nconductors. This problem will become more acute with increasing number density of\nfilaments. In the non-striated wide tape such defects do not have the cumulative effect on\nthe ability of the long conductor to carry transport current because the supercurrent can\ncircumvent the damaged areas and recombine behind them.\nThe normal operating regime of a conductor in a generator, motor, or transformer\nis sub-critical (the transport current is well below critical). In the sub-critical regime the\nresistive connections between the stripes cannot facilitate the sharing of the transport\ncurrent, because there is no potential difference between the stripes (the superconducting\nareas are equipotential). Therefore, the best way to achieve a degree of connectivity in\nthe striated superconductor operating in the sub-critical regime is to provide a system of\ndiscrete or continuous superconducting bridges between the stripes [23].\nHowever, such interconnections may increase the magnetization losses that depend\non the pattern of penetration of the magnetic field. The currents induced across the\nsuperconducting bridges and their metal over-layer become an additional source of\ndissipation which is absent in the fully striated tapes. Therefore, a layout of the coated\nsuperconducting tapes for ac applications has to be devised as a compromise between\ncompeting requirements \u2013 connectivity on one hand and the reduction of the net loss on\nthe other.\nThis paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the motivation behind the\nconcept of multiply connected superconducting films for ac applications. In subsection\n(A) we consider two primary sources of losses in multifilament conductors \u2013 hysteresis\nand coupling \u2013 and show that the total loss at the operating sweep rate of the applied\nfield can be reduced to the desired level by dividing the superconducting film into many\nparallel stripes. This, however, is predicated on the design of the conductor with correct\ncorrelation of such properties as the number density of stripes, the effective resistance of\n\n\f3\nthe barriers separating the superconducting stripes, and the length of the twist pitch. In\nsubsection (B) the vulnerability of multifilament conductors to small defects with the size\ncomparable to the width of an individual stripe is discussed. It is shown that without\ncurrent sharing between the stripes the usable length of the conductor as a whole is a\nfraction of a defect-free length of an individual stripe. With decreasing width of the\nstripes the probability of blockage increases exponentially, which makes it highly\nunlikely that a multifilament conductor without current sharing can be manufactured in\nsubstantial length.\nSections 3 and 4 are devoted to the experimental results in which the ac losses were\nmeasured in several differently patterned striated coated superconductors: fully striated\n(simply connected) and two multiply connected versions. The fully striated samples are\ncomprised of parallel superconducting stripes segregated by non-superconducting\nresistive barriers. They have the lowest losses, but the lack of connectivity makes such a\npattern vulnerable to defects, especially with fine filaments.\nMultiply connected patterns are devised as a compromise intended to ensure some\ndegree of connectivity as well as low ac losses. Their important feature is that any two\npoints of the superconducting film are connected by superconducting paths, but the\nsupercurrent induced by alternating magnetic field is still predominantly channeled into\nnarrow stripes. Magneto-optical imaging was used to obtain the overall picture of\nmagnetic field penetration in both, fully striated and multiply connected samples.\n2. Motivation for Multiply Connected Coated Superconductors.\nA) Losses in multifilament coated conductors.\n\u03c1 \u03c1\nThe rate of Joule heat generation by an electric field Q = \u222b j \u22c5 EdV , where\nintegration is extended over the volume of a conductor. Coated conductors are composite\nmaterials. In the superconducting film, the current density j is essentially constant, equal\nto the critical value (Bean model), and its direction is determined by the direction of the\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\nelectric field: j s = j c E / E . As the result, the amount of heat released in the\nsuperconducting layer is given by [5]\n\u03c1\nQs = j c \u222b E dVs .\n\n(1)\n\nThis component of the losses is usually called the hysteresis loss and the integration is\ncarried out over the volume of the superconductor. In the normal metal the losses are\ngiven by\n\u03c12\nQn = \u222b \u03c1 \u22121 E dVn .\n(2)\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n2\nHere E and E are local quantities averaged over the time cycle and the resistivity \u03c1\nmay be nonuniform. Eq. (2) includes the integration over the volume of the substrate, as\nwell as the stabilizer. Eqs. (1) and (2) have to be applied to a particular topology of the\nsuperconducting layer and coupled with the Maxwell equations. The reduction of losses\nin striated superconducting tapes is the result of reduction of the induced electric field\nwhich is determined by the pattern of penetration of the magnetic field.\nThe total power loss in a rectangular uniform superconducting film of width W,\nlength L and negligible thickness, exposed to a harmonically time-varying magnetic field\nis given by [24]\n\n\f4\nQ s \u2248 J cW 2 L ( B \u2212 Bc ) f ; B >> Bc\n\n(3)\n\nHere Jc is the density of critical current per unit width of the tape, Bc = \u03bc0Jc ln 4/\u03c0, and\n\u03bc0 = 4\u03c0 x 10-7 \u0397/m is the magnetic permeability of vacuum. The condition B >> Bc\ndefines the full penetration regime. For YBCO coated conductors the typical value of\nJ c \u2248 100 A/(cm width) which translates into Bc \u2248 10 mT. Hereafter we estimate losses\nonly in the practically important regime of full penetration. We also will consider the\npower loss expressions given below to be normalized per unit length of the conductor.\nIn order to reduce the hysteresis loss the uniform superconducting film can be\ndivided into parallel stripes[17]. In the multifilament superconductor comprised of N\nstripes the hysteresis loss is reduced in proportion to the width of an individual stripe Wn\n[25]:\nQs \u2248 I cWn ( B \u2212 Bc\u2032 ) f ;\nB >> Bc\u2032 ,\n(4)\nwhere Ic = JcNWn is the total critical current and\n\u03bc J ln 4\nBc\u2032 = 0 c\nM (a) ;\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u221e\n\u239b\n1\nsin 2 (a) \u239e\n\u239f\u239f ;\nM (a) = \u2212 2\nxdx ln\u239c\u239c1 \u2212\n2\na ln 2 \u222b0\n\u239d cosh ( x) \u23a0\n\n(5)\n\na = \u03c0Wn / 2\u2206W\n\n.\nHere \u2206W = W/N is the distance between the centers of the neighboring stripes. For\nexample, if the number density of stripes per unit width is 20 stripes /cm, as is the case\nwith most of the samples discussed below, \u2206W = 0.5 mm, while the width of the\nsuperconducting stripes Wn \u2248 0.47 mm. In this case Wn/\u2206W \u2248 0.9, which corresponds to\nM(a) \u2248 0.7. In the limit of very wide grooves between the stripes, when Wn/\uf020\u2206W << 1,\nM(a) tends to unity.\nThe purpose of striation, as it was originally envisioned [17], is to reduce the\nhysteresis loss in the full penetration regime by a factor 1/N. However, in the\nmultifilament conductor another channel of dissipation (coupling losses) appears as a\nresult of the induced currents passing between the superconducting stripes through the\nnormal barriers. In a rectangular flat multifilament sample of length L the electric field in\nthe direction perpendicular to the superconducting stripes [5] is\n\nE\u22a5 ( x, t ) \u2248 B\u03c9xSin (\u03c9t ) ,\n\n(6)\nwhere -L/2 < x < L/2 is the coordinate along the length of the sample. Assuming that the\nmagnitude of the electric field is approximately uniform over the cross-section area of the\nsubstrate, we obtain from Eq.(2):\n\u03c1 2\n\u03c0 2 ( BfL) 2\n\u22121\nQn = \u222b \u03c1 E \u22a5 dVn \u2248\nd nW .\n(7)\n\u03c1\n6\nHere dn is the thickness of the metal substrate. The coupling power loss per unit length\nincreases quadratically with the length of the sample. Therefore, in order to limit this\ncomponent of loss, a long multifilament conductor has to be twisted[17]. Equation (7)\nalso describes the coupling loss in a twisted conductor, where L is half of the twist pitch.\nThe numerical coefficient may be different depending on the type of the twist. Thus, at\n\n\f5\nfull field penetration the total magnetization power loss is determined by a simple\nquadratic function of the sweep rate Bf (see Eqs. (4) and (7)):\n\nQ = Qs + Qn \u2248 q s Bf + qn (Bf ) ; q s = Wn I c ;\n2\n\n\u03c0 2 L2\nqn =\nd nW\n6 \u03c1\n\n. (8)\n\nThe linear term describes the loss in the superconducting material and the quadratic term\n\u2013 the loss in the normal metal. The Eq. (8) can be rewritten in a more physically\ntransparent form:\n\nBf \u239e\n\u239b\nQ = \u03bb1 I c Bf \u239c1 +\n\u239f;\nR\u23a0\n\u239d\n\n\u03bb1 \u2248 Wn ;\n\nR=\n\nqs\n6 W \u03c1I\n\u2248 2 2n c .\nq n \u03c0 L d nW\n\n(9)\n\nHere, R is the break-even sweep rate at which the coupling loss is equal to the hysteresis\nloss. It determines approximately the optimal range of the operating sweep rate that the\nconductor should be exposed to in a particular application [22]. Thus, in order to reduce\nthe total loss to acceptable level, one has to reduce the width of an individual stripe, while\nmaintaining the value of the break-even rate R close to the operating sweep rate. The\nlatter can be achieved by increasing the sheet resistance \u03c1/dn and/or decreasing the length\nof the twist pitch.\n\nB) Reduction of critical current by defects.\nThe multifilament coated conductors inevitably will be much more susceptible to\ndefects than the currently manufactured wide uniform tapes. The degradation of currentcarrying capacity of the striated conductor by defects can be estimated in a model of\nuncorrelated defects. Let us consider the worst case scenario \u2013 just one defect is sufficient\nto block the current flow in a given stripe. The probability that a stripe of length L has n\ndefects is given by the Poisson distribution\n\np n = e \u2212 n n n / n! ,\nwhere n = L / l and l is the average length of a stripe without a single defect. The\nprobability that a striated tape comprised of N stripes has k stripe\nunblocked and therefore conducting, and the rest are blocked by one or more defects is\ngiven by\n\nPk =\n\nN!\np 0k (1 \u2212 p 0 ) N \u2212 k .\nk!( N \u2212 k )!\n\nThe average number of unblocked stripes k = Np 0 = Ne\ncurrent\n\nI c = I cst e \u2212 L / l ,\n\n\u2212L / l\n\nand the average critical\n\n\f6\n\nwhere\n\nI cst = NJ cWn\n\nis the maximum critical current of the multifilament conductor.\n\nFor example, if we adopt a requirement that\n\nI c should not be less than a certain fraction\n\nst\n\n\u03b5 of I c , the useful length of the conductor\n\nL \u2264 l ln(1 / \u03b5 ) .\n\n(10)\nThis is a severe restriction because it dictates that the conductor as a whole is only as\ngood as an individual stripe. For example, if one requires that\n\nI c should not be less than\n\nI cst ,\n\n75% of\n\nL \u2264 l ln(4 / 3) \u2248 0.3l\n\n.\n\nThe defect-free length of an individual stripe l can be estimated if we adopt a certain\nmodel of defects. In Refs. [26,27] such a model is based on the assumption that the\ngrain misalignment is the main reason for reduction of critical current in the long tapes.\nThe probability of appearance of a cluster of defects decreases exponentially with the size\nof the cluster. This leads to the logarithmic decrease of the critical current with length of\nthe conductor [27]. However, other reasons such as equipment malfunction during the\nmanufacturing - a drop of solvent or a speck of dust in the wrong place, etc. may lead to\nthe same result. Without specifying the nature of defect, let us assume that the probability\nof a defect size greater than R is\n\u2248 e \u2212\u03b1R .\nThe number of such defects M in a given stripe increases linearly with the area of the\nstripe.\n\n\u03ba\n\nM \u2248\n\nW n l \u2212\u03b1R\ne\n2\n.\nl0\n\n2\n\nHere l 0 is the characteristic area determined by the nature of defects. The prefactor\ndetermines the number of places \u2013 \"trouble spots\" \u2013 in a given stripe where a large defect\ncan nucleate. Models based on the assumption that grain misalignment is the main factor\nlimiting the critical current in the long tapes consider every grain as a potential trouble\nspot and take l0 to be of the order of the average grain size (see [26,27] and references\ntherein). This may not necessarily be true. If the dominant source of defects is equipment\nmalfunction (during manufacturing and/or exploitation) the characteristic area required\nfor a large defect to appear may be unrelated to and, in practice, much greater than the\ngrain size.\nA stripe will be blocked if the size of the defect is comparable to the width of the\nstripe\n\nR \u2248 W n = W / N . The defect-free length of an individual stripe is\n\ndetermined by the condition\n\nM \u2248 1 which leads to\n\n\f7\n\nl 02 \u03b1 W n\nl \u2245\ne\nWn\n\n.\n\n(11)\n\nLet us consider two extreme limits in which a long defect-free length can be achieved.\nFirst is a situation when the most prevalent defects simply have very few trouble spots on\nthe tape where they can appear. But once a trouble spot is created, its probability to\nbecome a defect is of the order of unity. In this case the defect-free length is determined\nby the prefactor in (11):\n\nl \u2245 l 02 / W n\n\n;\n\ne\n\n\u03b1 Wn\n\n\u2248 1.\n\nIn the opposite limit the long defect-free length may result from low probability of a\ndefect, even though the potential sites where they can appear are plentiful:\n\nK \u2261 W n l / l 02 >> 1 ; e\n\n\u2212 \u03b1Wn\n\n\u2248 K \u22121 << 1 .\n\nLet L N be the useful length of a conductor comprised of N stripes. How will this\nlength change when the number density of stripes doubles to 2N? According to Eqs. (10)\nand (11):\n\nL2 N\n\n(\n\n2 l 02 \u03b1 W n\n\u221d\ne\nWn\n\n)\n\n1/ 2\n\n\u239b l 02\n= 2 L N \u239c\u239c\n\u239d lNW n\n\n\u239e\n\u239f\u239f\n\u23a0\n\n1/ 2\n\n=\n\n2LN\nK 1/ 2\n\n. (12)\n\nIn the first scenario, the useful length may not change much, because the subdivision of\nthe tape into twice as many stripes does not increase the number of potential trouble\n\nspots, K \u2248 1 . In the second scenario, however, the effect of subdivision on useful\nlength will be much more spectacular because the probability of a blockage of a narrower\nstripe increases exponentially:\n\n(e\n\n\u2212\u03b1 W n\n\n)\n\n1/ 2\n\n>> e \u2212 \u03b1 W n\n\n.\n\nThus, if the number of potential trouble spots along the defect-free length is large, K >>\n1, the doubling of the number of stripes decreases the useful length by a factor K-1/2.\nFor example, let us consider the application of Eq. (12) to the models of grain\nmisalignment[26,27]. In this case every grain has to be treated as a potential trouble spot.\nWe know from experience that the useful length of a 20-filament conductor can exceed at\nleast 10 cm[20,22]. Taking\n\nl = 10 cm\n\n,\n\nW n = 0 . 5 mm and the average grain\n\nsize l 0 \u2248 30 \u03bc m [28], we get K \u2245 5 \u00d7 10 . The Eq. (12) would suggest\nthen, that a 40-filament conductor will have negligible useful length. This, however, is\nnot the case as shown below in section 3. The 40-filament, 10 cm long conductor is\nshown to have critical current of about 100 A, comparable to that of the 20-filament one.\nThus, the number density of the trouble spots has to be much smaller than the number\ndensity of grains and, therefore, the nature of current limiting defects in coated\n4\n\n\f8\nconductors is not grain misalignment. This statement should be qualified by the fact that\nthe width of the filament in the 20- and 40-filament experimental conductors is much\ngreater than the grain size. In the future, multifilament conductors with the stripe width of\nthe order of 50-100 \u03bcm the grain misalignment may become a more important factor\nlimiting their reliability.\nThere is little doubt that in practical, meters long, multifilament conductors of the\nfuture, the problem of reduction of critical current by defects, summarized by Eq. (12),\nwill be real and needs to be addressed. A way to alleviate this problem is not to segregate\nthe stripes completely, but to leave a sparse network of narrow superconducting bridges\nthat allow the current sharing between the stripes [23,27]. However, one has to ensure\nthat the superconducting interconnections do not defeat the main purpose of striation \u2013\nreduction of the magnetization losses. The main goal of this paper is to show that\nproperly placed and spaced by the distance comparable to the twist pitch bridges do not\nincrease substantially the power loss in such multiply connected superconducting films in\ncomparison with the fully striated films.\n3. Power loss in fully striated (simply connected) conductors.\nAll samples, fully striated and multiply connected ones, were cut from a 61 cm long\nsingle piece of coated superconductor provided by SuperPower Inc. [14]. The YBCO\nlayer in this sample was deposited on buffered Hastelloy substrate 90 \u03bcm thick and\ncovered with silver about 5\u03bcm thick. In this section we present the ac losses in two 1x10\ncm samples that were divided into 20 and 40 stripes respectively without superconducting\nbridges between the stripes.\nStriation of the tapes is accomplished by laser micromachining utilizing a frequency\ntripled diode-pumped solid-state Nd:YVO4 laser at 355 nm wavelength. Details of\nstriation by laser ablation are given in Ref. [29]. For striation of coated conductors we\nhave used the maximum scanning speed of the laser beam of 150 mm/s. The length over\nwhich a sample could be scanned without moving it was approximately 2.5 cm. Thus,\nthe 40-stripes, 2.5 cm long section can be processed in 8s. The translation speed of the\nmoving stage which carried the sample was close to 17 mm/s. Therefore, it takes about\n10s to process a 2.5 cm section and start a new one. The total rate of striation of the 40filament/(cm width) conductor is 15 cm/minute. This figure should not be considered\nrepresentative of the potential of laser ablation because we have used a system that was\navailable and no effort was applied to maximize the throughput. The relative merits of\nusing laser ablation for mass production of striated conductors can only be determined\nwhen the results of the competing approaches (photolithography, etc.) become available.\nFigure 1(a) shows a small area of the 40-filament sample. The distance between the\ngrooves is 250 \u03bcm. Figure 1(b) shows a typical profile of a groove. The electrical\nconnection between the substrate and YBCO and Ag is provided by Hastelloy that was\nmelted and splashed across the walls of the groove during ablation. The amount of YBCO\nlost as the result of ablation is about 6% and 12% for the 20-filament and 40-filament\nconductors respectively.\nThe magneto-optical (MO) imaging technique allows us to obtain an overall\nassessment of the quality of the superconducting film. MO characterization was\nperformed using a Bi-doped magneto-optical garnet film with in-plane magnetization\ngrown on Gadolinium Gallium Garnet substrates [30-32]. The sample was mounted on a\ncooling finger of a continuous flow optical cryostat capable of cooling to ~ 6K located on\n\n\f9\n\n(a)\n\n250 \u03bcm\n\n(b)\n\nSilver\n\n30 \u03bcm\nYBCO\n\nHastelloy substrate\n\nFig.1 (Color online) (a) Shown is a small\narea of a 1 cm wide coated conductor divided\ninto 40 stripes. The distance between the\ncenters of the grooves is 250 \u03bcm. The nonsuperconducting grooves are about 30 \u03bcm\nwide. The width of a superconducting stripe\nis about 220 \u03bcm. The top layer is silver. (b)\nProfile of the groove; the depth is about 10\n\u03bcm and it extends well into the substrate,\ncutting through silver, YBCO and buffer\nlayers\n\nFig. 2. (Color online) Magneto-optical image of a\nfully striated 1x1 cm sample divided into 20\nstripes. The sample was field-cooled in B=0.1 T to\nT=10 K and then the field was turned off. Bright\n(yellow online) bands correspond to magnetic flux\ntrapped by the superconducting stripes. Dark\n(green) spaces are non-superconducting grooves.\n\nan X-Y stage of a polarized optical microscope in reflective mode. To register the normal\ncomponent of the magnetic flux distribution on the sample surface, the indicator film was\nplaced on the top sample face. The external magnetic field was applied perpendicular to\nthe plane of the film by a small solenoid surrounding the cryostat-cooling finger. A\nsilicon diode and a LakeShore temperature controller adjusted the sample temperature. A\ndigital camera was used to record the magneto-optical images.\nFigure 2 shows a magneto-optical image of a 1x1 cm area of a sample divided\ninto 20 stripes. The sample was field cooled in the applied field of 100 mT to 10 K and\nthen the field was turned off. As the result, the magnetic flux was trapped in the\nsuperconducting stripes (bright bands, yellow online). This and other images below are\ntaken in color (available in online edition) which allows to show the direction of the\nmagnetic flux density. Yellow color indicates the trapped magnetic flux directed \"up\" \u2013\nin the direction of the applied field. Green color indicates the stray field directed \"down\".\nInside the grooves there are faint green lines indicating weak demagnetizing field caused\nby the supercurrents confined inside each stripe. The image demonstrates that laser\nablation produces fairly uniform stripes of good quality, except at the edges where the\n\n\f10\nsuperconducting film shows some fraying, which apparently was present even before\nstriation.\nIn order to measure the magnetization losses, the samples were placed inside the\nbore of a dipole magnet that generated time-varying magnetic field. The entire system\nwas cooled in liquid nitrogen. The magnetization loss was measured using a linked pickup coil[20]. In the experiment, the frequency was varied from 11.3 to 171.0 Hz.\n\nFig.3 (Color online) (a) Energy loss per meter length, per cycle for different frequencies in the 40-filament\nsample, plotted as a function of the amplitude of applied field. (b) the same data as in (a) presented as the\npower loss per meter length vs sweep rate. Also shown is the power loss in the 20-filament sample. For\ncomparison, the values of the power loss in both samples at Bf = 5.5 T/s are indicated.\n\nFigure 3 shows the ac losses in external time-varying magnetic field. The frequency\nrange and the amplitude of the field are indicated in the figure. In Fig. 3(a) the losses in\nthe 40-filament sample are shown in the traditional form as the energy loss per cycle. The\nper cycle loss increases with frequency and at all frequencies, except the lowest, the field\ndependence is non-linear indicating a substantial contribution of coupling losses.\nThe Fig. 3(b) shows the power loss vs sweep rate for both 20- and 40-filament\nsamples. It demonstrates that the power loss depends on one variable \u2013 the sweep rate,\nsee Eq. (8). Note that although the 40-filament sample has lower loss than the 20-filament\none, the difference is not large. For example, at the sweep rate of 5.5 T/s the 20-filament\nsample dissipates 740 mW/m, while the 40-filament sample dissipates 604 mW/m,\nwhich is only about 20% less. The reason for that is that the coupling losses are dominant\nin this range of the sweep rate and further increase of the number density of stripes will\nnot bring any substantial reduction of losses.\nIn order to separate the hysteresis and coupling losses it is convenient to\npresent data as suggested by Eq. (8) and shown in Fig. 4 \u2013 as power loss per unit of the\nsweep rate [22]. As the field amplitude increases above the level of full penetration, the\nlinear dependence of Q / Bf on the sweep rate, given by Eq.(8), becomes obvious. The\nstraight dashed lines in Fig.4 are obtained by fitting the 111.9 Hz data.\n\n\f11\n\nThe intercept of the straight lines\nis the hysteresis loss per unit of\nthe sweep rate denoted as qs in\nEq. (8) and the slope is the\ncoupling constant qn. From\nexperience[22] we know that the\n\nFig.4 (Color online) The same data as in Fig. 3(b)\npresented as power loss per unit of the sweep rate vs\nsweep rate (see Eq. (8)). (a) the 20-filament sample and\n(b) the 40-filament sample. For each sample the hysteresis\nloss qs (the y-axis intercept) and coupling loss qn (the\nslope) are shown and the break-even rate, R=3.86 T/s\nand 1.54 T/s respectively, are indicated by arrows.\n\nrelationship q s = Wn I c holds\nwell. Thus, the bulk average\ncritical current can be estimated\nfrom the values of qs shown in\nFigs. 4(a,b) and the known width\nof the filaments (note that 1 mJ/T\nm \u2261 1 mm A). We take the\nwidth of the non-superconducting\ngrooves to be close to 30 \u03bcm,\nFig. 1(b). Therefore, assuming\nthe width of the superconducting\nstripes to be 0.47 and 0.22 mm\nrespectively and taking the values\nof qs = 54 and 24 mJ/Tm, we\nobtain Ic=115A for the 20filament sample and Ic=109 A for\nthe 40-filament one. This is\nconsistent with the expected 6%\nand 12% reduction of the critical\ncurrent in these samples due to\nremoval of YBCO by ablation.\nThe measured transport critical\ncurrent in the 40-filament sample\nwas close to 100 A[33].\nThe break-even rate\ndefined by Eq.(9) can be\nestimated as follows:\n\nR\u2248\n\nqs \u03c1\n\u03c0 2 L2 d nW\n6\n\n(13)\n\nThe resistivity of Hastelloy is\npractically temperature independent, \u03c1 \u2248130 \u03bc\u03a9 cm. The thickness of the substrate is\nclose to 100 \u03bcm. Therefore, the sheet resistance of the substrate \u03c1/dn \u2248 13 m\u03a9[20]. For\nL=10 cm and W=1 cm, we get R \u2248 4.3 T/s for the 20-filament and R \u2248 1.9 T/s for the\n\n40-filament sample. The coupling constants q n = q s / R are equal to 14 mm A s/T\nand 15.6 mm A s/T respectively. The agreement with the experimental value is worse for\nthe 40-filament sample, indicating that Eq.(13) gives a correct order of magnitude\n\n\f12\nestimate, but misses a more subtle dependence of the coupling loss on the number of\nstripes.\n\n4. Multiply connected conductors.\nA way to alleviate the problem posed by small defects, as discussed above, is to\nallow current sharing between the stripes. Inherently, the interconnections lead to\nincreased magnetization loss[34]. Here we address a question of how compatible is the\npresence of superconducting bridges between the current-carrying stripes with the\nrequirement of low magnetization losses.\nFigure 5 shows sketches of two tested patterns. In Fig. 5(a) the \"brickwall\" pattern\nis shown. The positions of bridges\nconnecting a given stripe to the rest of\nthe sample alternate and the coupling\ncurrent, directed perpendicular to the\nstripes, has to take a meandering path.\nFigure 5(b) shows a different pattern \u2013\none continuous bridge connecting all\nstripes (\"fishnet\"). In either pattern the\ndistance between the successive\nbridges is called the current transfer\nlength Lt [35].\nThe minimum width of the\nbridge in both patterns should be half\nof the width of a stripe. This allows the\nFig. 5 (Color online) Two multiply connected\ntransport current to flow in- and out of\npatterns of the superconducting layer that have\na given stripe through the two nearest\nbeen tested. The superconducting area is shown in\nto the damaged area bridges without\ngray (blue online); the non-superconducting cuts\nraising the level of criticality j/jc in the\nare shown by dark lines. (a) Alternating bridges\nbridge above the average in the\n(brickwall pattern). (b) parallel bridges (fishnet\npattern). The distance between the successive\nconductor. Thus, a defect in a given\nbridges indicated by the arrow is the currentstripe can block it only over a distance\ntransfer length Lt.\nLt. The bridges will allow the current\nto circumvent the damaged length\nleaving the rest of the stripe usable. The criterion for the length of Lt is similar to the\ncondition (10):\n\nLt \u2264 l ln(1 / \u03b5 ) .\n\n(14)\n\nA) Fishnet pattern.\nFigure 6(a) shows a sketch of a sample with one bridge located in the center of the\nsample. Comparing with Fig. 5(b), we see that this is an imitation of a twisted conductor\nwith the current transfer length equal to half of the twist pitch and the bridge located\nexactly halfway between the nodes of the twisted tape[27]. A sample of finite length L is\nequivalent to a twisted tape with half of the twist pitch equal to L. Thus, our 10 cm long\nsamples imitate a twisted tape with 20 cm long twist pitch. In Fig. 6(b) the area around\nthe bridge of the actual 20-filament sample is shown. The width of the bridge is about\n200 \u03bcm, which is about half of the width of an individual stripe. The laser ablation was\n\n\f13\n\nFig.6 (Color online) (a) Sketch of the\nmultifilament sample with one superconducting\nbridge in the center, fragment of the fishnet\npattern shown in Fig.5(b). (b) A small area of the\nactual 20-filament sample. The length of the\nsample is 10 cm, width 1 cm, width of the bridge\n(about 200 \u03bcm) is approximately half of the width\nof an individual stripe. The top layer is silver.\n\nFig. 7 (Color online) Power loss per unit of the\nsweep rate vs sweep rate (see Eq. (8)) for the 20filament sample with a bridge in the center as\nshown in Fig 6. The hysteresis loss qs, the coupling\nloss qn and the break-even rate R = 5.3 T/s are\nindicated. The straight dashed line is the linear fit to\n111.9 Hz data.\n\ncarried out similarly to the 20-filament fully striated sample whose losses are shown in\nFig. 4(a).\nThe location of the bridge in the center of the sample is the most favorable from\nthe loss reduction point of view. The transverse electric field, Eq. (6), is minimum and the\nadditional loss in the bridge can be roughly estimated [27] using Eq.(3) and treating the\nbridge as a stripe whose length is W and width is \u2206. Thus, the amount of heat released in\nthe bridge per unit length of the sample\n\nJ c \u22062WBf\n\u22062\n\u2261 I cWn Bf\nQbr \u2248\n.\nL\nWn L\n\n(15)\n\nIf we take \u2206=Wn/2, the contribution of the centrally located bridge to losses is negligible\nin comparison with that of the stripes, Eqs. (4) and (8). Moreover, the width of the bridge\ncan be increased to be equal or even greater than Wn without paying significant penalty in\n\nterms of increased losses. Increasing \u2206 up to \u2206 \u2248 (Wn L )\nwill only double the\nhysteresis loss. Wider bridge will be a more reliable means for mixing and redistributing\nthe transport current between the stripes.\nFigure 7 shows the losses in the sample with one central bridge, shown in Fig 6.\nThe hysteresis constant qs is somewhat higher, and the coupling constant qn is somewhat\n1/ 2\n\n\f14\nlower than in the simply connected sample, Fig. 4(a), but the total losses in the fully\nstriated and fishnet pattern are almost the same as is illustrated below. At this point the\ndifference between the characteristic constants describing the losses may be attributed to\nthe sample-to-sample variations of the critical current.\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFig. 8 (Color online) (a) A sketch of the sample with\nalternating bridges (brickwall pattern). The bridges are\nplaced 1 cm away from the nearest edge. (b) A small\narea of the actual 20-filament sample. The top visible\nlayer is silver.

(c) Profile of the YBCO layer around the bridge.\nThe cap silver layer was etched away.\n\nB) Brickwall pattern.\nFigure 8(a) shows a\nsample whose pattern of bridges is\npart of the brickwall pattern\nshown in Fig. 5(a). In the 10 cm\nlong sample the bridges are placed\n1 cm from the nearest edge. This\ncorresponds to the current transfer\nlength 16 cm in the twisted\nconductor with the twist pitch 20\ncm[27]. Figure 8(b) is a\nphotograph of the actual 20filament sample. Figure 8(c)\nshows a profile of the YBCO\nlayer in the vicinity of a bridge\nmeasured by profilometer after\nthe cap silver layer was etched\naway.\nFigure 9(a) shows a\nmagnified image of the YBCO\nlayer near one of the bridges. The\ndistance between the grooves is\n500 \u03bcm, the width of the bridge\nconnecting the neighboring stripes\nis about 200 \u03bcm. Figure 9(b)\nshows a photograph of exposed\nYBCO layer that was patterned as\nshown in Fig. 5(a) with the\ncurrent transfer length Lt =3300\n\u03bcm, much smaller than that in Fig.\n8(a).\nFig. 10 shows magnetooptical images (Figs. 10(a) and\n(c)), and a conventional optical\nphotograph (Fig. 10(b)) of the\nsurface of a 1x1 cm sample with\nthe same pattern of cuts as that\nshown in Figs. 5(a) and 9(b). The\nMO pictures shown in this figure\nwere taken at 77 K, the same\ntemperature at which the losses\n\n\f15\nwere measured. The sample was cooled in zero magnetic field and then the field was\nslowly increased in steps of 4mT to a maximum of 40 mT and then reduced back to zero.\nThis procedure roughly imitates half a cycle of an alternating applied magnetic field.\nFigure 10(a) shows the distribution of the flux density at the start of this \"cycle\" when a\nsmall external field of 4 mT was\napplied. The bright areas identify the\nmaximum flux density penetrating\nthrough the grooves. The photograph\n(a)\nshows three rows of bridges. The\nmiddle row is indicated by the double\narrows pointing at the same area in all\nthree photographs. The bridges are\nsuperconducting and partially prevent\nthe magnetic flux from entering the\ncentral area of the grooves.\nThe arrows at the bottom of the\npicture point to the grooves. One can\nsee a big difference in the flux density\n(b)\nin odd- (1,3, ...) and even-numbered\n1650 \u03bcm\n(2,4, ...) grooves. This is because the\neven-numbered grooves extend to the\nedge of the sample and external field\npenetrates freely through them. Each\nof the odd-numbered grooves is\ncrossed by two additional bridges,\nlocated above and below the\nphotograph frame. These bridges\nimpede the penetration of magnetic\nflux into and its withdrawal from these\nFig. 9 (Color online) (a) In this photograph a\ngrooves to a greater degree than that in\nbridge between two stripes in exposed YBCO layer\nthe even-numbered grooves.\nis shown. The width of the stripes is about 500 \u03bcm,\nFigure 10(c) shows the flux\nthe bridge is about 200 \u03bcm wide.

The bright lines show the multiply connected \"backbone\" of the trapped\nmagnetic flux and the characteristic rooftop pattern in each of the superconducting\nstripes[12]. The bridges trap magnetic flux as well. The stray magnetic field in the\ngrooves is smaller than in the stripes and, therefore, the grooves appear as the darker\ncontrasted areas. When the applied field decreases, the odd-numbered grooves retain a\ngreater flux density and appear brighter than the even-numbered ones that extend to the\nedge of the sample. One can also see the uneven quality of the bridges. One of them\n(encircled areas) is non-superconducting and therefore invisible in the MO images.\nOthers display different degrees of field penetration.\nThis and other images of the same sample taken under different field conditions\nshow that the superconducting bridges create a gradient of the magnetic flux density\n\n\f16\nalong the groove and, therefore, induce the current flowing across the bridges which\ncontributes to dissipation. However, it also shows that the bridges are capable of\nredistributing the supercurrent between the stripes when needed.\n\n(a)\n\n1\n\n2 3\n\n4\n\n(b)\n\n1 2\n\n3 4\n\n(c)\n\n1 2 3 4\n\nFig. 10 (Color online) Images of the 20 stripes/cm film with alternating bridges (same pattern as in\nFig. 9(b)).

(a) MO image in external\nfield 4 mT at the start of the cycle. Bright areas correspond to maximum flux density. The arrows (1, 2,\n3, 4 ...) point at non-superconducting grooves. (b) Optical photograph of the same area. Double\narrows indicate one of the three visible rows of bridges in each figure. The distance (along a groove)\nbetween successive bridges Lt = 3300 \u03bcm. (c) MO image of the same area as in (a) after the external\nfield is turned off (end of half-cycle). Non-superconducting (defective) bridge is encircled.\n\nThe electric field in the area of the bridges is given by Eq.(6). Using Eq.(1) the additional\nloss associated with a single bridge located at a distance x from the centerline can be\nestimated as follows:\n\nQbr(1) \u2248\n\n2\n\n\u03c0\n\nJ c B\u03c9x \u222b dAs\n\n(16)\n\nHere integration is carried out over the effective area of the bridge. Looking at Fig.\n10(a,c) one can guess that the effective length of this area is comparable to the width of\nthe groove and certainly less than the width of a stripe: As \u2248 \u03bbb \u2206 with \u2206 \u2264 \u03bbb \u2264 Wn .\nIn the sample shown in Fig. 8(a) there is one bridge per groove, N-1 bridges total. The\ntotal additional loss associated with bridges per unit length of the sample is given by\n\n\u239b 4 x \u03bbb \u2206 \u239e\n\u239f\nQbr \u2248 I c BfWn \u239c\u239c\n2 \u239f.\nL\nW\nn \u23a0\n\u239d\n\n(17)\n\n\f17\nIn the sample shown in Fig. 8(a) x=4cm, L=10cm, \u2206/Wn \u2248 0.5 and if we take the upper\nlimit for \u03bbb / Wn \u2248 1 , the hysteresis loss should increase by 80% in comparison with\nthe contribution of stripes, Eqs. (4).\nFigure 11 shows the power loss in the sample patterned as shown in Fig. 8(a).\nThe hysteresis loss qs is about 20% higher than in fully striated sample, Fig. 4(a). This is\nconsistent with the estimate\n(17) where \u03bbb / Wn \u2248 1 / 4 .\nThe coupling constant qs is\npractically the same as in fully\nstriated sample, Fig. 4(a).\nFigure 12 shows the\n111.9 Hz data for all three\ntested patterns. The brickwall\npattern clearly has higher\nlosses due to higher hysteresis\nloss. The loss in the sample\nwith the one centrally located\nbridge is closer to that in the\nfully striated sample.\n5. Summary.\nFig. 11 (Color online) Power loss per unit of the sweep rate\nvs sweep rate (see Eq. (8)) for the 20-filament sample with\nalternating bridges as shown in Fig 8(a). The hysteresis loss\nqs, the coupling loss qn and the break-even rate R = 4.8 T/s\nare indicated. The straight dashed line is the linear fit to\n111.9 Hz data.\n\nFig. 12 (Color online) For comparison, the data for three 20filament samples with different patterns - fully striated (Fig.\n4(a)), fishnet (Fig. 7) and brickwall (Fig. 11) are shown\ntogether. To avoid clutter, only one frequency, 111.9 Hz, is\nincluded.\n\nThe magnetization loss\nmeasurements\ndemonstrate\nthat\nmultiply\nconnected\nsuperconducting tapes in\nwhich the individual currentcarrying stripes are connected\nwith each other by a sparse\nnetwork of superconducting\nbridges can have the total loss\ncomparable to that of the fully\nstriated tapes. The allowable,\nby condition of loss reduction,\nlinear density of bridges\n(along the filaments) depends\non the length of the twist\npitch, and should not exceed\n1-4 bridges per half of the\ntwist pitch. Without current\nsharing the multifilament\nconductors will be very\ndifficult to manufacture in\nsubstantial length because of\nthe cumulative effect of\nrelatively small defects and\ndefects clusters on its current-\n\n\f18\ncarrying capacity. This will particularly be true in conductor with very fine filaments. We\nshould note that the effectiveness of the superconducting bridges in increasing the useful\nlength of the multifilament conductor has not been experimentally confirmed yet. The\nresults presented here indicate that if such interconnections will prove to be effective and\nnecessary in increasing the reliability of the future coated conductors, the increase in\nmagnetization losses by interconnections is tolerable.\nAnother noteworthy point is that further reduction of magnetization losses,\nbeyond what has been achieved in the 20-filament conductors, cannot be accomplished\nwithout solving the problem of coupling losses. As the data in Fig. 3(b) demonstrate,\nfurther increase in the number density of stripes brings rapidly diminishing results\nbecause the main contribution to losses comes from the coupling currents. Since the twist\npitch length cannot be decreased substantially below 5-10 cm, other solutions have to be\nfound for reducing the coupling losses. These will have to lead to drastic increase in the\neffective resistance of the grooves by at least one or two orders of magnitude over that\nachieved in our samples.\nAcknowledgements:\nWe would like to thank M.
