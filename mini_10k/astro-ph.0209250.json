The models cover ages between 1 and 15 Gyr, metallicities\nbetween 1/200 and 3.5 solar. The impact from the element abundance changes on the\nabsorption-line indices are taken from Tripicco & Bell (1995), using an extension of\nthe method introduced by Trager et al. (2000). Our models are free from the intrinsic\n\u03b1/Fe bias that was imposed by the Milky Way template stars up to now, hence they\nreflect well-defined \u03b1/Fe ratios at all metallicities. The models are calibrated with\nMilky Way globular clusters for which metallicities and \u03b1/Fe ratios are known from\nindependent spectroscopy of individual stars. The metallicities that we derive from the\nLick indices Mg b and Fe5270 are in excellent agreement with the metallicity scale by\nZinn & West (1984), and we show that the latter provides total metallicity rather than\niron abundance. We can reproduce the relatively strong CN-absorption features CN1\nand CN2 of galactic globular clusters with models in which nitrogen is enhanced by a\nfactor three. An enhancement of carbon, instead, would lead to serious inconsistencies\nwith the indices Mg1 and C2 4668. The calcium sensitive index Ca4227 of globular\nclusters is well matched by our models with [Ca/Fe] = 0.3, including the metalrich Bulge clusters NGC 6528 and NGC 6553.

We find that the index [MgFe] \u2261\nMg b (0.72 * Fe5270 + 0.28 * Fe5335), instead, is completely independent of \u03b1/Fe and\nserves best as a tracer of total metallicity.

Interestingly, the indices Mg b and Mg2 of earlytype galaxies yield higher metallicities (and younger ages)\nthan the indices Fe5270 and Fe5335 (Peletier 1989; Worthey,\nFaber & Gonz\u00e1lez 1992; Davies, Sadler & Peletier 1993;\nCarollo & Danziger 1994; Bender & Paquet 1995; Fisher,\n\u22c6 Available in people/dthomas/SSPs at ftp.mpe.mpg.de\n\u2020 Email: dthomas@mpe.mpg.de\n\nFranx & Illingworth 1995; J\u00f8rgensen 1999; Mehlert et al.\n1998; Kuntschner 2000; Longhetti et al. 2000; and others).\nThe most straightforward qualitative interpretation of these\nstrong Mg-indices and/or weak Fe-indices is that the stellar\npopulations in elliptical galaxies have high Mg/Fe element\nratios (or \u03b1/Fe ratios if Mg is taken as representative of \u03b1elements) with respect to the solar values (Worthey et al.\n1992). This finding strongly impacts on the theory of galaxy\nformation, as super-solar \u03b1/Fe ratios require short star formation time-scales (. 1 Gyr, Matteucci 1994; Thomas,\nGreggio & Bender 1999), that are not achieved by current models of hierarchical galaxy formation (Thomas 1999;\nThomas & Kauffmann 1999).\nHowever, there exist two major caveats about this con-\n\n\f2\n\nDaniel Thomas, Claudia Maraston, & Ralf Bender\n\nclusion. 1) Lick indices have very broadly defined line windows (\u223c 40 \u00c5). Each index actually contains a large number of absorption features from various elements, so that\nthe direct translation into element abundances is not very\nstraightforward (Greggio 1997; Tantalo, Chiosi & Bressan\n1998). 2) The stellar library (Worthey et al. 1994) used in\nstellar population models to compute Lick indices contains\nonly very few stars with metallicities above solar. An additional complication is that in these libraries \u03b1/Fe is not\nindependent of Fe/H (see Section 2.4).\nIn order to resolve these ambiguities, Maraston et al.\n(2002) compare the Lick indices of Simple Stellar Population\n(SSP) models with data of metal-rich globular clusters of the\nGalactic Bulge (Puzia et al. 2002), the ages and and element\nabundances of which are known from high-resolution stellar spectroscopy. They find that metal-rich, \u03b1/Fe enhanced\nBulge clusters show the same features as early-type galaxies:\ntheir Mg indices are stronger than predicted by SSP models\nat a given Fe index value. This result is empirical evidence\nthat Mg and Fe indices indeed trace \u03b1/Fe element ratios.\nMaraston et al. (2002) verify the uniqueness of interpreting the strong Mg indices and weak Fe indices in elliptical galaxies in terms of Mg over Fe element overabundance.\nThey show that alternative explanations like uncertainties in\nstellar evolution and SSP modelling, or a significant steepening of the initial mass function (IMF) do either not reproduce the observed indices or violate other observational\nconstraints. Maraston et al. (2002) further show that the\nstandard models reflect variable element abundance ratios\nat the various metallicities, in particular super-solar \u03b1/Fe\nratios at sub-solar metallicities.\nMotivated by these results, we construct stellar population models for various and well-defined element abundance ratios. We present the whole set of Lick indices (CN1 ,\nCN2 , Ca4227, G4300, Fe4383, Ca4455, Fe4531, C2 4668, H\u03b2,\nFe5015, Mg1 , Mg2 , Mg b, Fe5270, Fe5335, Fe5406, Fe5709,\nFe5782, Na D, TiO1 , and TiO2 ) of SSP models with the \u03b1/Fe\nratios [\u03b1/Fe] = 0.0, 0.3, 0.5. The models cover ages from 1\nto 15 Gyr, and total metallicities from [Z/H] = \u22122.25 to\n0.65. In these models, the elements nitrogen and calcium\nare enhanced in lockstep with the other \u03b1-elements, hence\n[\u03b1/N] = 0.0 and [\u03b1/Ca] = 0.0. Additionally, we provide\nmodels with variable \u03b1/N and \u03b1/Ca ratios, [\u03b1/N] = \u22120.5\nand [\u03b1/Ca] = \u22120.1, 0.2, 0.5. The impact from the element\nabundance changes on the absorption-line indices are taken\nfrom Tripicco & Bell (1995, hereafter TB95), using an extension of the method introduced by Trager et al. (2000,\nhereafter T00). The models are calibrated with the globular\ncluster data of Puzia et al. (2002). The present models now\nallow for the unambiguous derivation of SSP ages, metallicities, and element abundance, in particular \u03b1/Fe, ratios.\nThe paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we describe the construction of the models, and introduce the\nmain input parameters. In Section 3 we present the model\nresults and their calibration with globular cluster data. If\nthe reader is predominantly interested in the application of\nthe present SSP models, for the first reading we recommend\nto skip Section 2, and to focus on the summary given in\nSection 2.5.\nThe models for selected ages are provided in\nthe tables in the appendix. Their complete versions\n\nare available electronically via ftp at ftp.mpe.mpg.de\nin the directory people/dthomas/SSPs, via WWW at\nftp://ftp.mpe.mpg.de/people/dthomas/SSPs, or email to\ndthomas@mpe.mpg.de.\n\n2\n\nMODEL CONSTRUCTION\n\nThe classical input parameters for stellar population models\nare the slope of the IMF, the age and the metallicity with\nfixed (solar) element abundance proportions. In this paper,\nwe introduce the abundances of individual elements as a\nfurther parameter, allowing for various element mixtures at\ngiven total metallicity. The new SSP models are based on the\nstandard SSP models computed with the code of Maraston\n(1998). For Lick indices refer to Maraston & Thomas (2000),\nMaraston et al. (2001), and Maraston et al. (2002). These\nbase models are modified according to the desired element\nabundance ratios. In the following paragraphs of this section\nwe describe these modifications step by step and introduce\nthe main input parameters.\n2.1\n\nThe basic SSP model\n\nThe underlying SSP models are presented in Maraston\n(1998) and C. Maraston (in preparation). In these models,\nthe fuel consumption theorem (Renzini & Buzzoni 1986) is\nadopted to evaluate the energetics of the post main sequence\nphases. The input stellar tracks (solar abundance ratios)\nwith metallicities from 1/200 to 2 solar, are taken from Cassisi, Castellani & Castellani (1997), Bono et al. (1997), and\nS. Cassisi (1999, private communication). The tracks with\n3.5 solar metallicity are taken from Salasnich et al. (2000).\nLick indices are computed with the calibrations of the indices as functions of the stellar parameters (the so-called fitting functions) by Worthey et al. (1994). The impact from\nusing alternatively the fitting functions of Buzzoni (Buzzoni, Gariboldi & Mantegazza 1992; Buzzoni, Mantegazza\n& Gariboldi 1994) or Borges et al. (1995) and the resulting\nuncertainties in the modelling are discussed in Maraston,\nGreggio & Thomas (2001) and Maraston et al. (2002). In\nthis paper we focus on the fitting function of Worthey et al.\n(1994), because they comprise all 21 Lick absorption line\nindices. Our models adopt a Salpeter (1955) IMF slope.\n2.2\n\nVarying element abundances\n\nThe aim is to obtain SSP models with various and welldefined element abundance ratios at fixed total metallicity.\nThe most important ratio is \u03b1/Fe, which is the ratio of the\nso-called \u03b1-elements (N, O, Mg, Ca, Na, Ne, S, Si, Ti) to\nthe Fe-peak elements (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn), because\nit carries information on the formation time-scale of stellar\npopulations (see the Introduction).\n2.2.1\n\nEnhanced and depressed groups\n\nTo enhance the abundance ratio \u03b1/Fe keeping the total\nmetallicity constant, the increase in the abundances of the\n\u03b1-elements has to be counterbalanced by the decrease of Fepeak element abundances. Following T00's notation, we call\nthe former enhanced group and the latter depressed group.\n\n\fStellar population models with variable element abundance ratios\nWe keep the abundance of carbon fixed, as in the solar neighbourhood carbon appears less enhanced than the \u03b1-elements\n(McWilliam 1997). T00 include a model in which carbon is\nassigned to the depressed group. We tested this option, and\nfound that the depression of carbon leads to serious inconsistencies between models and globular cluster data of the\nindices CN1 , CN2 , C2 4668, and Mg1 (see Section 3, T00).\nAll elements heavier than Zn are assumed not to vary.\nOur prescriptions are identical to T00's Model 1, except that we include the \u03b1-element calcium in the enhanced\ngroup. This choice is motivated by the evidence that in halo\nand disc of our Galaxy the element calcium follows the typical abundance patterns of the other \u03b1-elements like oxygen\nand magnesium (McWilliam 1997). T00, instead, assign calcium to the depressed elements, because elliptical galaxies\nhave low Ca4227 and Ca4455 indices (Vazdekis et al. 1997;\nWorthey 1998; Trager et al. 1998). In a separate model we\nexplored this case. We verified that the resulting SSP models\nof none of the 21 indices-except Ca4227-are significantly\ndifferent when calcium is assigned either to the enhanced or\nthe depressed group, simply because only Ca4227 is sensitive\nto calcium abundance (TB95). Curiously, Ca4455 is completely insensitive to the element calcium (TB95). Moreover,\nthe fractional contribution of Ca to the total metallicity is\ntoo small (\u223c 0.1 per cent) to change the isochrone and SSP\ncharacteristics.\n2.2.2\n\nVarying \u03b1/Fe ratios at constant metallicity\n\nThe starting point is a total metallicity in which the mass\nfractions of the enhanced and depressed groups are X + and\nX \u2212 , respectively. Its \u03b1/Fe ratio normalized to the solar value\n+\n\u2212\n(X\u2299\n/X\u2299\n) is defined as\n[\u03b1/Fe] = log\n\n\u0012\n\nX+\nX\u2212\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2212 log\n\n\u0012\n\n+\nX\u2299\n\u2212\nX\u2299\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(1)\n\nIn order to obtain a new chemical mixture with the same\ntotal metallicity, we change X + and X \u2212 by the factors f\u03b1\nand fFe , respectively, such that the new \u03b1/Fe is\n[\u03b1/Fe]new = log\n\n\u0012\n\nf\u03b1\nfFe\n\n\u0013\n\n+ log\n\n\u0012\n\nX+\nX\u2212\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2212 log\n\n\u0012\n\n+\nX\u2299\n\u2212\nX\u2299\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\nThe conservation of total metallicity requires the following condition\nf\u03b1 X + + fFe X \u2212 = X + + X \u2212 ,\nor, dividing by X \u2212 ,\nf\u03b1\n\n\u0012\n\nX+\nX\u2212\n\n\u0013\n\n+ fFe =\n\n\u0012\n\nX+\nX\u2212\n\n\u0013\n\n+1 .\n\n(3)\n\nFrom Equations 1 to 3 the factors f\u03b1 and fFe can be determined for given [\u03b1/Fe] and [\u03b1/Fe]new .\n+\nFrom Grevesse, Noels & Sauval (1996) we adopt: X\u2299\n=\n\u2212\nO\n0.0148 (solar oxygen abundance X\u2299 = 0.0096), X\u2299 =\n0.0016, and total solar metallicity Z\u2299 = 0.02. With these\nvalues, a new abundance ratio [\u03b1/Fe]new = 0.3 starting from\nthe solar values [\u03b1/Fe] = 0 (i.e. increasing \u03b1/Fe by a factor of 2) is obtained with f\u03b1 = 1.052 and fFe = 0.526.\nThus, as also emphasized by T00, super-solar \u03b1/Fe ratios\nat fixed total metallicity are produced by a decrease of the\nFe abundance rather than by an increase of the \u03b1-element\n\n3\n\nabundances. The reason for this effect is that the \u03b1-element\noxygen is the most abundant element in the Sun after hydrogen and helium, so that total metallicity is by far dominated\nby oxygen (48 per cent by mass). The remaining \u03b1-elements\ncontribute 26 per cent, the Fe-peak elements only 8 per cent\nto the total amount of metals in the Sun.\nThe following notation will be used throughout this paper. We distinguish between total metallicity [Z/H], iron\nabundance [Fe/H], and \u03b1-element to iron ratio [\u03b1/Fe]. Only\ntwo of these quantities are independent. Following Tantalo\net al. (1998) and T00, they can be related through the following equation.\n[Z/H] = [Fe/H] + A [\u03b1/Fe]\n\n(4)\n\nwith\nA=\u2212\n\n\u2206[Fe/H]\n\u2206[\u03b1/Fe]\n\nThe factor A depends on the partition between enhanced\nand depressed elements. For our adopted mixtures (see previous section) we obtain A = 0.94. For more details see T00.\n2.2.3\n\nVarying \u03b1/N and \u03b1/Ca ratios\n\nBoth nitrogen and calcium are assigned to the enhanced\ngroup. Therefore, the ratios \u03b1/N and \u03b1/Ca are fixed to the\nsolar value ([\u03b1/N] = 0, [\u03b1/Ca] = 0) in the \u03b1/Fe enhanced\nmixtures described in the previous section. We computed\nadditional models with chemical mixtures in which nitrogen\nand calcium are detached from the group of enhanced elements and their abundances are allowed to vary with respect\nto the abundances of the other \u03b1-elements. We computed\na model in which nitrogen is enhanced by a factor 3 with\nrespect to the other \u03b1-elements, hence [\u03b1/N] = \u22120.5, and\nvarious models in which calcium is depressed with respect to\nthe other \u03b1-elements, hence [\u03b1/Ca] = 0.1, \u22120.2, \u22120.5. Note\nthat the fractional contribution of the elements nitrogen and\ncalcium to total metallicity is only \u223c 5 and 0.3 per cent,\nrespectively. The different \u03b1/N and \u03b1/Ca ratios are therefore achieved essentially by changing the abundances of the\nelements N and Ca, and the perturbation of the total metallicity budget is negligible.\n2.3\n\nEffects of element abundances on Lick indices\n\nThe account for the impact from abundance variations of\nindividual elements on the absorption line-strengths is the\nprincipal ingredient of models with variable element abundances. In the models of this paper, the variation of the Lick\nabsorption line indices owing to element abundance changes\nis taken from TB95 as described below.\n\n2.3.1\n\nEffect on representative evolutionary phases\n\nTB95 computed model atmospheres and synthetic spectra\nalong a 5 Gyr old isochrone with solar metallicity. On these\nmodel atmospheres they assess the impact on Lick indices\nfrom element abundance variations. The model atmospheres\nhave well-defined values of temperature and gravity, chosen to be representative of the three evolutionary phases,\ndwarfs (Teff = 4575 K, log g = 4.6), turnoff (Teff = 6200 K,\n\n\f4\n\nDaniel Thomas, Claudia Maraston, & Ralf Bender\ndwarfs with these temperatures play a minor role in the integrated indices (Maraston et al. 2002). We assign the Subgiant Branch phase to the turnoff because of the very similar\nTeff and log g. The evolutionary phase 'giants' consists of the\nRed Giant Branch, the Horizontal Branch, and the Asymptotic Giant Branch phases.\n2.3.2\n\nTripicco & Bell Response Functions\n\nOn each model atmosphere-dwarfs, turnoff, giants-TB95\nmeasure the absolute Lick index value I0 . Doubling in turn\nthe abundances Xi of the dominant elements C, N, O,\nMg, Fe, Ca, Na, Si, Cr, and Ti, they determine the index\nchanges \u2206I(i). The abundance effects are therefore isolated\nat a given temperature and surface gravity. In this way,\nTB95 provide the first partial derivative \u2202I/\u2202[Xi ] of the\nindex I0 for the logarithmic element abundance increment\n\u2206[Xi ] \u2261 log Xi1 /Xi0 = log 2 = 0.3 dex. Information on the\nsecond partial derivatives is not provided by the TB95 calculations.\nThe most simple approach to express the index I as a\nfunction of element abundances is to use a Taylor series:\nFigure 1. Dependence of the position of the reference model by\nTripicco & Bell (1995) on metallicity and age. The star symbols\nare the representative positions of the three evolutionary phases\ndwarfs, turnoff and giants (from bottom to top) used in Tripicco &\nBell (1995). Isochrones with solar (solid line) and sub-solar (dotted lines) metallicity are from S. Cassisi (see text), the very metalrich ones (dashed lines) are taken from Salasnich et al. (2000). For\nevery metallicity, models with 5 and 15 Gyr are plotted, to show\nalso the effect of the age. A temperature of 5000 K is adopted to\nseparate cool dwarfs from turnoff stars on the main sequence, at\nevery metallicity.\n\nlog g = 4.1) and giants (Teff = 4255 K, log g = 1.9). These\ncouples of Teff and log g are very appropriately chosen. The\ngiant model, for instance, is placed at a location of the\nisochrone where most of the fuel is burned (Fig. 1), i.e. at the\nbase of the Red Giant Branch and on the Horizontal Branch\n(Maraston 1998). For instance, a reference model for giants\nwith a much lower gravity would have overestimated the effect on the Mg indices, which are very strong at very low\ngravity and temperature.\nAt different metallicities and ages, the three evolutionary phases are in principle represented by slightly different\ncouples of Teff and log g. The effect is shown in Fig. 1, where\ncouples of isochrones (with ages 5 and 15 Gyr) at various\nmetallicities (see references in the caption) are plotted in the\nTeff versus log g plane. The star symbols denote the dwarfs,\nturnoff and giants locations defined by TB95. The larger\nthe metallicity, the closer is the dwarf-border to the turnoff,\nand vice versa. The turnoff is hotter at decreasing age or\nmetallicity, but the gravity keeps rather constant around\nlog g \u223c 4.1. Fig. 1 shows that the phases are rather well defined independent of age and metallicity. We use the fixed\ntemperature of 5000 K to separate the turnoff region from\nthe cool dwarfs on the Main Sequence, independent of age\nand metallicity. In order to assess quantitatively the impact\nof this choice, we computed the integrated indices of the\nmost metal-rich SSP adopting 4000 K instead of 5000 K.\nWe find that the resulting SSP indices change by only \u223c 0.1\nper cent. The impact is so small because for standard IMFs\n\nInew = I +\n\nn\nX\n\u2202I\ni=1\n\n\u2202[Xi ]\n\n\u2206[Xi ] + . . . ,\n\n(5)\n\nwith i indicating a chemical element.\nThe logarithmic abundance variation \u2206[Xi ] depends on\nthe desired element abundance ratio, and is determined for\nthe elements of the enhanced and the depressed groups separately from Eqns. 2 and 3. Hence \u2206[Xi ] = log f\u03b1 and\n\u2206[Xi ] = log fFe for elements from the enhanced and depressed group, respectively. Equation 5 can be applied, only\nif the second (and higher order) derivatives are negligible.\nIn other words, the absorption line indices must be linear\nfunctions of the logarithm of the element abundances, hence\nI \u221d [Xi ]. Is this the case?\nStudies on the behaviour of the Lick indices as functions\nof individual element abundances are only available from the\nwork by TB95. However, it is reasonable to assume that in\nthe linear regime of the growth curve the absorption line\nstrength I is proportional to the number of absorbers, so\nthat we can expect I \u221d Xi \u221d exp([Xi ]). Hence, Equation 5,\nthat requires instead I \u221d [Xi ], is not an optimal approximation. This rough estimate gets support from the work by\nBorges et al. (1995), who derive empirically from Milky Way\nstars that Mg2 \u221d exp([Mg/H]) (the other Lick indices are\nnot discussed in Borges et al. 1995). This functional form implies that-at least in the linear part of the growth curve-\nln I instead of I is a linear function of [Xi ]. Therefore, it is\nmore appropriate to consider the Taylor expansion of ln I in\nplace of Eqn. 5.\nln Inew = ln I +\n\nn\nX\n\u2202 ln I\ni=1\n\n\u2202[Xi ]\n\n\u2206[Xi ] + . . .\n\nNeglecting the higher order derivatives we can write\nln Inew\n\n=\n\nln I +\n\nn\nX\n\u2202 ln I\ni=1\nn\n\n=\n\nln I +\n\n\u2202[Xi ]\n\n\u2206[Xi ]\n\nX 1 \u2202I\ni=1\n\nI0 \u2202[Xi ]\n\n0.3\n\n\u2206[Xi ]\n0.3\n\n(6)\n\n\fStellar population models with variable element abundance ratios\n=\n\nln I +\n\nn\nX\n\nR0.3 (i)\n\ni=1\n\n\u2206[Xi ]\n,\n0.3\n\nTable 1. \u03b4 corrections to negative indices for a 12 Gyr isochrone\n\nwith R0.3 (i)-following the notation of T00-being the index response to the abundance change of the element i by\n0.3 dex (hereafter, specific fractional index change) given in\nTB95.

This condition,\nhowever, is not generally fulfilled for Lick indices. They\ncan become negative, depending on the definition of line\nand pseudo-continuum windows. This typically happens at\nyoung ages and/or low abundances, and must be corrected\nbefore using Eqn. 7, otherwise ln I is not defined. We therefore shift negative index values in Eqn. 7 by the amount\n\u03b4 required to approach zero at zero element abundances.\nTo mimic the (unknown) index value at zero element abundance, we set\n\nThe specific (i.e. referred to element i) fractional index\nchange\n\n\u03b4 \u2261 Ilow \u2212 |Ilow | .\n\n(8)\n\nIlow is the index value at the lowest metallicity of our grid\nat a given age, i.e. Ilow = I([Z/H] = \u22122.25) for metallic\nindices. For H\u03b2 we use Ilow = I([Z/H] = 0.67).\nThen we apply the TB95 correction to the scaled index\nI \u2212 \u03b4. After the TB95 correction we scale the resulting index\nInew \u2212 \u03b4 back. This procedure can be summarized in the\nfollowing modification of Equation 7:\nInew \u2212 \u03b4 = (I \u2212 \u03b4)\n\nn\nY\ni=1\n\nexp\n\n\u001a\n\n\u001b(\u2206[Xi ]/0.3)\n\n1\n\u2202I\n0.3\nI0 \u2212 \u03b4 \u2202[Xi ]\n\n(9)\n\nIndices with positive values are assumed to reach the\nvalue zero at zero abundances and therefore do not require\nany correction, i.e. \u03b4 = 0.\nWe determine \u03b4 for each evolutionary phase of each SSP\nseparately. These \u03b4 values for the illustrative case of a 12 Gyr\nisochrone are shown in Table 1. Only the indices CN1 , CN2 ,\nC2 4668, and Fe5782 are significantly affected. The classical\nindices Mg2 , Mg b, Fe5270, Fe5335, and H\u03b2 (the contribution\nfrom the dwarf phase to H\u03b2 is negligible), do not require any\ncorrection.\n\nTotal fractional index changes\n\nR0.3 (i) =\n\n1 \u2202I\n0.3 ,\nI0 \u2202[Xi ]\n\nis the main input in Equation 7. TB95 provide both I0 and\n(\u2202I/\u2202[Xi ]) * 0.3. However, the authors do not always match\nwell the I0 values measured for Milky Way stars. One of\nthe striking examples is H\u03b2 in cool dwarfs and giants. Owing to the neglect of non-LTE effects (TB95), TB95 measure on their model atmosphere with Teff = 4255 K and\nlog g = 1.9 the absorption index H\u03b2 = 0.05 \u00c5, while cool\ngiants with that temperature typically have H\u03b2 > 1 \u00c5 (see\nFig. 12 in TB95). This discrepancy results in a higher fractional response R0.3 by a factor of 20. For the dwarfs TB95\nobtain H\u03b2 = \u22120.1 \u00c5, while dwarfs with Teff = 4600 K have\nH\u03b2 > 0 (Fig. 12 in TB95). We therefore prefer to rely on the\nvalues provided by TB95 in a differential sense, and adopt\nfrom TB95 only the index variations ((\u2202I/\u2202[Xi ]) \u00d7 0.3 in\nEqn. 7). The absolute I0 values for the three evolutionary\nphases, instead, are those of our underlying 5 Gyr, Z\u2299 SSP\nmodel. These values and the original I0 values of TB95 are\nlisted in Columns 2 \u2212 7 of Table 2. It can be seen that the\ndifference between our and TB95's I0 values is significant\nfor the indices CN1 , CN2 , TiO1 , and TiO2 in the dwarf\nphase, Ca4455, C2 4668, Fe5782, Na D, TiO1 , and TiO2 in\nthe turnoff phase, and Ca4227, H\u03b2 (see above), Mg1 , and\nTiO1 in the (dominating) giant phase. Again, the frequently\nused indices Mg2 , Mg b, Fe5270, and Fe5335 are very well\nmatched by the models of TB95.\nThe total (i.e. integrated over all elements) fractional\nindex changes in each phase obtained from applying Eqn. 9\nare given in the Columns 8\u201310 of Table 2. These numbers\ngive the percentage variations of all individual indices to an\nincrease of the \u03b1/Fe ratio to [\u03b1/Fe] = 0.3.

We expect\nonly small age dependencies, because the spectrophotometric evolution of an SSP is mild after the RGB phase transition (\u223c 1 \u2212 2 Gyr), hence for the ages computed for the\nmodels of this paper. The dependency on metallicity needs\nto be assessed through TB95-calculations at low element\nabundances.

These are constructed from empirical stellar libraries that reflect the chemical history of the Milky Way.\nMetal-poor halo stars ([Fe/H] . \u22121) have [\u03b1/Fe] \u2248 0.3, because they formed at early epochs when the chemical enrichment was dominated by Type II supernovae nucleosynthesis.\nThe \u03b1/Fe ratios of the metal-rich disk stars, instead, decreases from [\u03b1/Fe] \u2248 0.3 to solar for increasing metallicity\n\u22121 . [Fe/H] . 0 (Edvardsson et al. 1993; Fuhrmann 1998)\nowing to the delayed Type Ia supernova enrichment (e.g.,\nGreggio & Renzini 1983; Matteucci & Greggio 1986; Pagel &\nTautvaisiene 1995; Thomas, Greggio & Bender 1998). This\nimplies that every stellar population model adopting these\nMilky Way based index calibrations suffers from this bias\nin the \u03b1/Fe ratio, i.e. the model Lick indices reflect supersolar \u03b1/Fe at sub-solar metallicities (Borges et al. 1995).\n\n\fStellar population models with variable element abundance ratios\nTable 3.

(2002).\nTherefore, we assume that the base model does not\nhave solar abundance ratios at every metallicity, but possess\nthis residual intrinsic \u03b1/Fe ratio, or \u03b1/Fe bias, at sub-solar\nmetallicities. In our models we account for this bias with the\naid of Eqn. 1 to 3, putting as the starting [\u03b1/Fe] in Eqn. 1\nthe \u03b1/Fe bias. The adopted values of [\u03b1/Fe] for the various\nmetallicities are given in Table 3. These are based on abundance measurements in Milky Way stars (see the review by\nMcWilliam 1997 and references therein) and are those providing the best calibration of our resulting SSP models with\nglobular cluster (GC) data (see Section 3). We further assume that the input [Fe/H] in the fitting functions is not\ntotal metallicity but iron abundance (see Maraston et al.\n2002). Thanks to these corrections we are able to provide\nfor the first time SSP models with well-defined \u03b1/Fe ratios\nat all metallicities.\n\n2.5\n\nSummary of model construction\n\nBase model.- The underlying SSP models are presented\nin Maraston (1998) and Maraston et al. (2002). In these\nmodels, the fuel consumption theorem (Renzini & Buzzoni\n1986) is adopted to evaluate the energetics of the post main\nsequence phases. The input stellar tracks (solar abundance\nratios) with metallicities from 1/200 to 2 solar, are taken\nfrom Cassisi et al. (1997), Bono et al. (1997), and S. Cassisi (1999, private communication). The tracks with 3.5 solar metallicity are taken from Salasnich et al. (2000). Lick\nindices are computed by adopting the fitting functions of\nWorthey et al. (1994). A Salpeter (1955) IMF is adopted.\n\u03b1/Fe enhancement.- The \u03b1/Fe enhanced mixtures are\nproduced by increasing the abundances of the \u03b1-groupelements N, O, Mg, Ca, Na, Ne, S, Si, Ti, and by decreasing\nthe Fe-peak element (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) abundances, such that total metallicity is conserved (see T00).\nIn additional models, the elements nitrogen and calcium\nare detached from the \u03b1-group, and Lick indices for various \u03b1/N and \u03b1/Ca ratios are computed. The effect from\nthese element abundance changes on the Lick indices are\ntaken from TB95. These authors computed model atmospheres and synthetic spectra for the three evolutionary\nphases dwarfs, turnoff, and giants of a 5 Gyr old isochrone\nwith solar metallicity. They double in turn the abundances\nof the dominant \u03b1- and Fe-peak elements, and determine\nfor each phase separately the resulting index changes. The\nTB95 fractional changes are incorporated in the models using an extension of the method introduced by T00.\nThree evolutionary phases.- We compute the final\nSSP models in the following way. The basic SSP model is\ndivided in the three evolutionary phases as defined in TB95.\n\n7\n\nThe standard Lick indices are computed for each phase separately and modified according to the desired element abundance ratio using the index responses from TB95. The final\nindex is the flux-weighted sum over the three phases.\n\u03b1/Fe bias.- Most importantly, we take into account that\nany stellar population model being based on stellar libraries\nconstructed from Milky Way stars reflects the chemical enrichment history of the Milky Way. This implies that standard model Lick indices are biased toward super-solar \u03b1/Fe\nratios at sub-solar metallicities. Accounting for this bias, the\nmodels presented here have well-defined \u03b1/Fe ratios at all\nmetallicities.\n\n3\n\nCALIBRATION ON GLOBULAR CLUSTERS\n\nGlobular clusters are the observed counterparts of theoretical simple stellar populations, because their stars are coeval\nand have all the same chemical composition. Therefore, globular clusters are the ideal targets for calibration purposes.\nBy using a new set of globular cluster data (Puzia et al.\n2002), the metallicities of which extend up to solar, Maraston et al. (2002) check the 21 Lick indices of the base model.\nThe result is that above [Z/H] & \u22121 the standard model is\nnot able to reproduce the data because effects from \u03b1/Fe\nratios are not included. To solve this problem, we construct\nthe present \u03b1/Fe enhanced SSP models. In this section we\npresent their calibration with globular cluster data.\nGalactic globular clusters in the halo and in the bulge\nappear coeval independent of their metallicities (Ortolani\net al. 1995; Rosenberg et al. 1999; Piotto et al. 2000).\nAges between 9 and 14 Gyr which are derived from colormagnitude diagrams (VandenBerg 2000). Therefore the calibration performed here tests the models with old ages. For\na calibration at younger ages with the globular clusters of\nthe Large Magellanic Cloud see Beasley, Hoyle & Sharples\n(2002).\n\n3.1\n\n\u03b1/Fe ratios\n\nFrom high-resolution stellar spectroscopy it is known that\nglobular clusters in both the halo and the Bulge of our\nGalaxy are \u03b1/Fe enhanced with the typical values [\u03b1/Fe] \u2248\n0.3 \u00b1 0.1 dex (Barbuy et al. 1999, Cohen et al. 1999, Carretta et al. 2001, Coelho et al. 2001, Origlia, Rich & Castro 2002, and compilations by Carney 1996, and Salaris &\nCassisi 1996). Hence, the observed Lick indices of globular\nclusters should be matched by SSP models with t \u2248 12 Gyr\n(see above) and [\u03b1/Fe] \u2248 0.3.\nThe comparison is shown in Fig. 2, in which we plot\nthe Mg b index versus the other 20 Lick indices. The indices are arranged according to increasing wavelength. Filled\nsquares are globular cluster data (Puzia et al. 2002), solid\nlines are the new SSP models presented here with constant\nage (12 Gyr) and constant \u03b1/Fe ratio.

(1998).\n3.1.1\n\nThe \u03b1/Fe bias in standard models\n\nThe standard models are shown as dotted lines in Fig. 2.\nAs their \u03b1/Fe bias is [\u03b1/Fe] \u2248 0.3 at the lowest metallicity (see Table 3), this biased model (dotted line) deviates\nclearly from the [\u03b1/Fe] = 0 model and coincides with the\n[\u03b1/Fe] = 0.3 model (middle solid line). Indeed, as shown\nin Maraston et al. (2002), because of the \u03b1/Fe bias the\nbase model matches the Lick data of the metal-poor globular clusters. At solar metallicity and above, there is no bias\nin the standard model (Table 3), so that the dotted lines\nand the [\u03b1/Fe] = 0.0 model (solid line with the lowest Mg b)\nare indistinguishable for [Z/H] > 0. This pattern is present\nthroughout all panels in Fig. 2.\n3.1.2\n\nSensitivity to Fe-peak elements\n\nAs emphasized in T00, and explained at the beginning of\nSection 2.2, the enhancement of the \u03b1/Fe ratio at fixed\nmetallicity is produced essentially by a depletion of the Fe\nabundance (see also Buzzoni et al. 1992), and only by a\nslight increase of the \u03b1-element abundances. The reason is\nthat Fe-peak elements are by far less abundant than oxygen\nand the other \u03b1-elements. As a consequence, only indices\nthat are sensitive to Fe-peak element abundance variations\nrespond to \u03b1/Fe ratio changes at fixed metallicity. Mg b,\nfor instance, anti-correlates with Fe abundance (TB95), and\ntherefore increases with increasing \u03b1/Fe.\nCa4227, instead, correlates with both Ca and Fe abundance (TB95). As the depletion of iron dominates the \u03b1/Fe\nenhanced model, Ca4227 actually decreases with increasing\n\u03b1/Fe, although the element calcium belongs to the enhanced\ngroup in our models. The indices CN1 and CN2 correlate\nwith \u03b1/Fe, also mainly because of their sensitivity to Fepeak element abundances.\n3.1.3\n\nDiscussion on individual indices\n\nCN1 ,CN2 .-The models clearly predict too low index values\nat all metallicities, in particular for CN1 , although both indices respond positively to changes in the \u03b1/Fe ratios. Such\nrelatively strong CN absorption features have also been observed for extragalactic globular clusters in M 31 (Burstein\net al. 1984) and NGC 3115 (Kuntschner et al. 2002). As\nshown in Maraston et al. (2002), the mismatch between\nmodels and data is already present in the standard SSP\nmodel (dotted lines), thus cannot be attributed to a failure of the TB95 index responses. Moreover, the integrated\nlight of the galactic Bulge (open squares) does not have such\nstrong CN absorption features.\nIt has been suggested by D'Antona, Gratton & Chieffi\n(1983) and Renzini (1983), that stars in globular clusters\nmay accrete carbon and/or nitrogen enriched ejecta from\nthe surrounding AGB stars (Renzini & Voli 1981). Indeed\nCN1 and CN2 are very sensitive to carbon and to nitrogen\n\nabundances (TB95). To test this option quantitatively, we\ncomputed additional models enhancing separately the abundances of C and N. The resulting models for the indices\nCN1 , CN2 , Ca4227, C2 4668, and Mg1 are shown in Fig. 3.\nThe remaining Lick indices (except G4300) are not affected\nby carbon and nitrogen abundance changes.\nAn increase of the carbon abundance by 30 per cent\nis sufficient to obtain an excellent match of the CN1 and\nCN2 data (left-hand, top panels in Fig. 3). However, also\nC2 4668 and Mg1 strongly correlate with the element carbon,\nso that these indices are not reproduced any more by the\nmodels with enhanced carbon abundance (left-hand middle\npanels in Fig. 3). It is not possible to match simultaneously\nthe four indices CN1 , CN2 , C2 4668, and Mg1 . Assuming\nthat the index responses by TB95 are correct, we can rule\nout that a significant enhancement of the carbon abundance\nproduces the CN1 and CN2 indices of globular clusters (see\nalso Worthey 1998).\nIncreasing the nitrogen abundance by a factor 3 with\nrespect to the \u03b1-elements ([\u03b1/N] = \u22120.5), instead, the indices CN1 and CN2 are well reproduced, without destroying\nthe match to the other indices, as the latter are almost insensitive to nitrogen abundance (right-hand panels in Fig. 3,\nTable B1). Based on the TB95 calculations, already Worthey\n(1998) argued that an enhancement of nitrogen rather than\ncarbon is required to explain the CN-absorption in globular\ncluster stars. The model calculations of this paper now allow us to quantify this conclusion. We show that nitrogen\nneeds to be enhanced in globular cluster stars by 0.5 dex\n(factor 3). This is consistent with the results from Origlia\net al. (2002), who find nitrogen to be enhanced by a factor\n\u2248 2 in stars in NGC 6553, while carbon is not enhanced.\nIt should be emphasized again that the CN features of the\nBulge light, instead, are perfectly reproduced by the models\nwithout extra-enhancement of nitrogen.\nCa4227.\u2013The absorption index Ca4227 is predicted\nslightly too high by the models. Interestingly, Ca4227 is the\nonly index besides CN1 and CN2 which is considerably affected by changes of carbon and nitrogen abundances. Its\nline-strength is anti-correlated with CN abundances (TB95),\nso that the poor match of the globular cluster data in\nFig. 2 is improved with the CN-enhanced models shown\nin the bottom panels of Fig. 3. Taking the enhancement\nof nitrogen into account, our \u03b1/Fe enhanced models with\n[Ca/Fe] = [\u03b1/Fe], provide a good fit to the globular cluster data, including the metal-rich clusters NGC 6528 and\nNGC 6553. This indicates that the latter do not exhibit\nany anomalies in calcium abundance, i.e. their Ca/Fe ratio\nare enhanced like the other \u03b1-element/Fe ratios. This result agrees with element abundances derived for single stars\nin these clusters (Carretta et al. 2001; Origlia et al. 2002),\neven though the latter are still controversial. Barbuy and\ncoworkers (B. Barbuy, 2002, private communication) measure [Mg/Fe] = 0.3 but [Ca/Fe] = 0.0 in a clump star of\nNGC 6528, which would imply a Ca underabundance in that\ncluster.\nMotivated by the realization that elliptical galaxies have\nweaker Ca4227 indices than predicted by standard SSP models (Vazdekis et al. 1997; Trager et al. 1998), we additionally\ncomputed models of Ca4227 with variable \u03b1/Ca ratios (Table C1). The application of these models and the derivation\n\n\fStellar population models with variable element abundance ratios\n\n11\n\nFigure 3. Models in which carbon is enhanced by 0.1 dex (left-hand panels) and in which nitrogen is enhanced by 0.5 dex (right-hand\npanels). Only carbon and nitrogen sensitive indices are shown. Line-styles and symbols like in Fig. 2.\n\n\f12\n\nDaniel Thomas, Claudia Maraston, & Ralf Bender\n\nof \u03b1/Ca ratios for elliptical galaxies is presented in an accompanying paper (D. Thomas et al., in preparation).\n\ntios, however, it is less recommendable for abundance ratio\nstudies than Fe4383.\n\nG4300.\u2013This index is mainly sensitive to carbon and\noxygen abundances, only little to Fe abundance (TB95).\nIt responds therefore only marginally to the \u03b1/Fe ratio\nchanges, as enhanced \u03b1/Fe ratios are not caused by \u03b1element enhancement, but by Fe reduction. At high metallicities, it is even less sensitive to total metallicity than H\u03b2 (see\nalso TB95). The calibration of the models with the globular\ncluster data is not convincing.\n\nMg1 ,Mg2 .\u2013It is very reassuring that all three Mg-indices\nMg1 , Mg2 , and Mg b respond very similarly to \u03b1/Fe ratio\nchanges. The models plotted in Fig. 2 are therefore highly\ndegenerate. The globular cluster data are well reproduced.\nAmong the three indices, Mg2 turns out to be least, Mg b to\nbe most sensitive to \u03b1/Fe.\n\nFe4383.\u2013This index is very sensitive to Fe abundance,\nhence \u03b1/Fe ratios. The models provide an excellent fit to\nthe data, so that Fe4383 is well calibrated and represents\na promising (blue) alternative to the classic indices Fe5270\nand Fe5335.\nCa4455.\u2013As emphasized by TB95, despite its name\nCa4455 is insensitive to Ca abundance, while Fe and Cr,\nboth elements of the depressed group, are the dominant contributors to this index. As Ca4455 is correlated to Cr, but\nanti-correlated to Fe abundance, however, it responds hardly\nto \u03b1/Fe ratios changes. The globular cluster data and the\nmodel predictions are not compatible as already shown in\ncase of the base model (Maraston et al. 2002). It is more\nlikely that this mismatch originates from an offset of the\nglobular cluster data from the Lick system (see Maraston\net al. 2002), because these data seem also incompatible with\nthe Lick galaxy data of Trager et al. (1998, small grey symbols). The index Ca4455 is therefore not a useful abundance\nindicator.\nFe4531.\u2013This index is reasonably well calibrated, but\nit is less sensitive to Fe abundance and \u03b1/Fe ratios than\nFe4383.\nC2 4668.\u2013Formerly called Fe4668, this index has been\nrenamed, because it is most sensitive to carbon abundance\n(TB95). As carbon is kept fixed in our models, C2 4668 decreases only slightly with increasing \u03b1/Fe. Owing to the poor\nmatch between models and globular cluster data, this index\nis not well suited for element abundance studies. Assigning\ncarbon to the depressed group, does not improve the match\nbetween data and models, and provokes inconsistencies with\nthe otherwise well calibrated indices Mg1 , CN1 , and CN2 .\nH\u03b2.\u2013The Balmer absorption index is well calibrated.\nIt increases mildly with increasing \u03b1/Fe. The increase\nof Balmer absorption in globular clusters with decreasing\nmetallicity is very well reproduced by our models (see also\nMaraston & Thomas 2000). This strong Balmer absorption\nat old ages and low metallicities stems from the development of warm horizontal branches owing to mass loss on\nthe Red Giant Branch. As shown in Maraston et al. (2002),\nthe slightly lower H\u03b2 values of the two globular clusters at\nintermediate metallicity (Mg b \u2248 2.8) can be easily reproduced by models with reduced mass loss along the red giant\nbranch, in good agreement with their observed red horizontal branch morphologies. The models used here have blue\nhorizontal branches at metallicities below [Z/H] \u223c \u22121.\nFe5015.\u2013Although TB95 produce only a poor fit of this\nindex, our models are in good agreement with the globular\ncluster data. As Fe5015 is only little sensitive to \u03b1/Fe ra-\n\nFe5270,Fe5335.\u2013These are the classical indicators for\nFe abundance. They are perfectly matched by our models.\nFe5335 is somewhat more sensitive to \u03b1/Fe.\nFe5406.\u2013This index is very similar to Fe5270 and\nFe5335. Although the \u03b1/Fe enhanced models predict slightly\nlower Fe5406 values than suggested by the data, this index\nis still reasonably well calibrated.\nFe5709.\u2013The match between models and data is excellent. However, Fe5709 responds less strongly to \u03b1/Fe because of its weaker sensitivity to Fe abundance (TB95).\nFe5782.\u2013For this index, the match between models and\nglobular cluster data is very poor. Different from the situation of Ca4455, it is hard to assess if the globular cluster data\nare compatible with the Lick galaxy measurements of Trager\net al. (1998). The standard SSP models (dotted line), which\nare perfectly compatible with the Worthey (1994) models,\nclearly predict too low Fe5782 indices. A miscalibration of\nthe fitting function therefore may also be a possible explanation for the mismatch between models and data (Maraston\net al. 2002).\nNa D.\u2013Similar to Fe5782, the standard SSP model gives\nlower index values than suggested by the observational data,\nin accordance with the Worthey (1994) models. An unrealisticly large sensitivity of the index to the \u03b1/Fe ratio would\nbe required to lift the models on the data. Most likely, the\nstrong NaD absorption is caused by Na absorption in interstellar material of the Galactic disc. Indeed, there is the\nclear trend that the clusters in the sample that are closer to\nthe Galactic plane have higher NaD relative to their Mg b\nindices. This high sensitivity of the NaD index to interstellar\nabsorption severely hampers its usefulness for stellar population studies.\nTiO1 ,TiO2 .\u2013Both indices appear badly calibrated, although the agreement between models and data for TiO2\nis still acceptable. As discussed in Puzia et al. (2002), the\nmost metal-rich clusters NGC 6528 and NGC 6553 show\nvery strong TiO2 absorption because of their extremely cool\nRed Giant Branches, in accordance with the strong bending\nobserved in color-magnitude diagrams (Ortolani, Barbuy &\nBica 1991; Cohen & Sleeper 1995).\n3.1.4\n\nMeasuring \u03b1/Fe from Mg b/hFei\n\nThe models provided here allow for the derivation of \u03b1/Fe\nelement ratios from the Lick indices like Mg b and hFei. In\nthe following, we show how the index ratio Mg b/hFei can be\nused to obtain an estimate of the element ratio \u03b1/Fe. For this\npurpose, in Fig. 4 we plot Mg b/hFei as a function of \u03b1/Fe.\nAs Mg b/hFei depends not only on \u03b1/Fe but also on age\nand metallicity, we show the areas covered by models with\n\n\fStellar population models with variable element abundance ratios\n3.1.6\n\nFigure 4. Lick index ratio Mg b/hFei as a function of element\nabundance ratio \u03b1/Fe. The dark hashed area are models covering\nmetallicities \u22121.35 6 [Z/H] 6 0.35 and ages from 8 to 15 Gyr.\nThe light-grey area are models with the same metallicities but\nthe larger age range 3 6 t 6 15 Gyr.\n\na range in ages and metallicities. The dark shaded area are\nmodels covering metallicities \u22121.35 6 [Z/H] 6 0.35 and ages\nfrom 8 to 15 Gyr. The light-grey area are models with the\nsame metallicities but the larger age range 3 6 t 6 15 Gyr.\nFor old populations (ages above \u223c 8 Gyr), the relation\nbetween Mg b/hFei and \u03b1/Fe is reasonably well defined independent of age and metallicity. In this case, Fig. 4 allows\nto read off directly the \u03b1/Fe element ratio \u00b10.04 dex from\nthe measured index ratio Mg b/hFei.\n\n3.1.5\n\n\u03b1/Fe enhanced stellar evolutionary tracks\n\nIn the models presented here, solar-scaled stellar tracks are\nadopted. The impact on Lick indices due to \u03b1/Fe enhancement is accounted for through a modification of the stellar absorption line-strengths (see Section 2). A fully selfconsistent \u03b1/Fe enhanced SSP model should in principle use\n\u03b1/Fe enhanced stellar evolutionary tracks, because the element abundance variations in a star affect also the star's evolution and the opacities in the stellar atmosphere, hence the\neffective temperature. We are planning in future to compute\nSSP models with \u03b1/Fe enhanced tracks that are based-for\nreasons of self-consistency-on the same input tracks (Cassisi et al. 1997) as the present models.\nTo assess the impact of \u03b1/Fe in the stellar evolutionary tracks, Maraston et al. (2002) compute standard models with the solar-scaled and the \u03b1/Fe enhanced tracks from\nSalasnich et al. (2000). As the \u03b1/Fe enhanced tracks are hotter than the solar-scaled ones (Salasnich et al. 2000), their\ninclusion in the stellar population model leads to slightly\nweaker metallic indices (i.e. Mg b, hFei etc.) and stronger\nBalmer line indices (H\u03b2) for the same age and metallicity\n(Fig. 5 in Maraston et al. 2002). The decrease of Mg b and\nhFei are comparable, so that the additional inclusion of \u03b1/Fe\nenhanced tracks has only a minor effect on the Mg b-hFei\nplane, and therefore has no significant impact on the derivation of \u03b1/Fe ratios. This issue is explored in detail in an\naccompanying paper (Thomas & Maraston 2002).\n\n13\n\nSummary\n\nTo briefly summarize, the classical indices Mg1 , Mg2 , Mg b\nand the blue indices CN1 and CN2 increase with increasing \u03b1/Fe ratio, in particular the latter owing to an anticorrelation with Fe abundance. With the caveat that CN1\nand CN2 are very sensitive to C and N abundances, these\ntwo can be regarded complementary to the indices Mg1 ,\nMg2 , Mg b. Besides the intensively studied iron indices\nFe5270 and Fe5335, the indices Fe4383, Fe4531, Fe5015, and\nFe5709 are good representatives of Fe-peak element abundances. The indices G4300, Ca4455, C2 4668, Fe5782, Na D,\nTiO1 , instead, are poorly calibrated and do not provide valuable information on abundance ratios. Ca4227, H\u03b2, Fe5406\nand TiO2 cannot be assigned to any of these three categories.\nH\u03b2 is only little sensitive to element abundance variations, and is well calibrated. Ca4227 is mainly sensitive to\nCa and N abundances. This index, and the indices CN1 and\nCN2 , require an additional enhancement of nitrogen abundance with respect to the other \u03b1-elements by a factor 3\n([\u03b1/N] = \u22120.5), in order to fit the globular cluster data.\nConcluding, the combination of the blue indices CN1 ,\nCN2 and Fe4383 may be best suited to estimate \u03b1/Fe ratios\nof objects at redshifts z \u223c 1.\n\n3.2\n3.2.1\n\nMetallicities\nThe globular cluster metallicity scale\n\nIn this section we compare the total metallicities [Z/H] derived here for the galactic globular cluster sample with the\nmetallicities given in the Harris (1996) catalog, which are\nbased on the Zinn & West (1984, hereafter ZW84) scale. We\nadd the data of the globular cluster 47 Tuc from Maraston\net al. (2002)1 . For the metal-rich bulge cluster NGC 6553\nwe adopt the more recent measurements of single star abundances by Barbuy et al. (1999), who find-in good agreement with Origlia et al. (2002)-solar total metallicity.\nZW84 metallicities are usually referred to as [Fe/H]. As\nwe actually aim at calibrating our SSP models, in which we\ndistinguish between total metallicity [Z/H] and iron abundance [Fe/H], at this point it is crucial to understand, if\nthe ZW84 metallicity scale traces total metallicity or iron\nabundance. It is important to remember, that the ZW84\nscale at [Fe/H] > \u22121.5 is based on measurements by Cohen\n(1983) of the pseudo-equivalent widths for the Mg triplet\nnear 5175 \u00c5, and the 5270 and 5206 \u00c5 Fe blends. She derives the metallicity from averaging the Mg and Fe equivalent widths. These metallicities are then used by ZW84 to\nset up a globular cluster metallicity scale. The average of Mg\nand Fe line kills information on \u03b1/Fe ratios and is likely to\nbe close to the total metallicity. This strongly suggests that\nthe ZW84 metallicity scale traces total metallicity rather\nthan iron abundance at [Z/H] & \u22121.5. We suggest that the\nZW84 metallicities should better be written as [Z/H] instead\nof [Fe/H], in order to avoid confusion.\nWe determine [Z/H] from the Lick indices Mg b and\n1\n\nThe original spectrum comes from Covino, Galletti & Pasinetti\n(1995). The Lick indices have been measured in the Worthey et al.\n(1994) system by Maraston et al. (2002) on the spectrum provided\nby S. Covino (2002, private communication).\n\n\f14\n\nDaniel Thomas, Claudia Maraston, & Ralf Bender\n\nFigure 5.

Fig. 5 shows that our derived total metallicities [Z/H] are in excellent agreement\nwith the ZW84 metallicity scale. This result is highly reassuring but not unexpected, as we derive metallicities from\nexactly the same lines (Mg triplet at 5157 \u00c5 and Fe blend\nat 5270 \u00c5) as Cohen (1983), even though from integrated\nlight and at the much lower Lick resolution (\u223c 8 \u00c5).\nThe iron abundance [Fe/H] can be obtained through the\nfollowing scaling (see Section 2.2, Eqn. 4),\n[Fe/H] = [Z/H] \u2212 0.94 [\u03b1/Fe]\nand is lower than [Z/H] for super-solar \u03b1/Fe ratios. The\n[Z/H] and [\u03b1/Fe] ratios derived here for the globular cluster sample are listed in Table 4. The iron abundances of\nall the globulars considered here are lower than the total\nmetallicity by typically \u223c 0.3 dex. Our measured [Fe/H] are\ntherefore systematically lower by this value than the ZW84\nmetallicities, reinforcing the interpretation that the ZW84\nscale implies total metallicity.\nBased on high resolution spectroscopy of individual\n\nstars in globular clusters, Carretta & Gratton (1997) suggest\na revision of the classical ZW84 scale to essentially higher\nmetallicities. The shift is of the order 0.2 dex, which leads to\na clear disagreement between the metallicities derived here\nfrom Lick indices and the metallicity scale of Carretta &\nGratton (1997). The same discrepancy emerges from considering integrated colors of globular clusters. Maraston (2000)\nshow that SSP models using reasonable ages (& 9 Gyr) and\nthe Carretta & Gratton (1997) metallicities of globular clusters predict B \u2212V colors that are too red compared to the\nobserved values. With the ZW84 metallicities, instead, excellent agreement between SSP model prediction and observation is found. Caputo & Cassisi (2002) come to the\nsame conclusion comparing isochrones with observed colormagnitude diagrams of globular clusters.\nInterestingly, in contrast to Cohen (1983), Carretta &\nGratton (1997) measure 'metallicity' exclusively from Fe line\nfeatures, so that their values should rather be iron abundances than total metallicities. Taking this into account, the\ndiscrepancy to the metallicities derived from isochrones and\nSSP models gets even more severe (see Fig. 8 in Maraston\net al. 2002). Barbuy (2000) suggests that Carretta & Gratton (1997) may tend to overestimate element abundances\nand metallicities because of a hotter temperature scale.\nA comparison between the metallicities of globular clusters derived from Lick indices and the ZW84 metallicity scale\nhas also been carried out by Cohen, Blakeslee & Ryzhov\n(1998). They used Worthey (1994)'s SSP models to fit simultaneously by \u03c72 minimization the indices Mg b, NaD,\nFe5270, and Fe5335 measured for globular clusters including also the metal-rich bulge cluster NGC 6528. The authors did not find a satisfying consistency between their derived metallicities and the ZW84 scale. They had to introduce a scaling between ZW84 and their derived metallicities,\nas they over-predicted metallicities for the more metal-rich\nclusters. This may partly be due to the higher Fe indices\nmeasured (see Puzia et al. 2002), partly due to the fact that\nWorthey (1994)'s SSP models do not include \u03b1/Fe abundance effects.\nConcluding, we would like to emphasize again that\nmetallicity determinations from colors and Lick indices with\nthe models of this paper are both in excellent agreement with\nthe ZW84 metallicity scale. This highly encouraging selfconsistency is also found by Kuntschner et al. (2002), who\nderive-with the models of this paper-the same metallicities of globular clusters in the elliptical galaxy NGC 3115\nfrom the Lick indices Mg b and hFei, and V \u2212I colors.\n3.2.2\n\nBrodie & Huchra's metallicity calibration\n\nMeasuring line indices on galactic and M31 globular cluster\nspectra, Brodie & Huchra (1990) derived a linear correlation\nbetween Mg2 index and ZW84 metallicity. For a comparison\nof our derived metallicities [Z/H] with this calibration, in\nFig. 6 we show [Z/H] of the globular cluster sample versus\nMg2 , and over-plot as a solid line the linear relation derived\nby Brodie & Huchra (1990). The dotted line is our SSP\nmodel with age t = 12 Gyr and [\u03b1/Fe] = 0.3.\nAlthough reassuring, the excellent agreement does certainly not come as a surprise, as Brodie & Huchra (1990)\nderived their fit on the basis of ZW84 metallicities, which are\nperfectly consistent with our [Z/H] values (Fig. 5). More in-\n\n\fStellar population models with variable element abundance ratios\n\nFigure 6. Total metallicity [Z/H] versus Mg2 index. The circles\nare galactic globular clusters (Puzia et al. 2002). [Z/H] is determined from the indices Mg b and Fe5270, using the SSP models of\nthis paper with fixed age t = 12 Gyr (see also Fig. 5). The solid\nline is the metallicity calibration by Brodie & Huchra (1990).\nThe dotted line is the SSP model of this paper with fixed age\nt = 12 Gyr and [\u03b1/Fe] = 0.3.\n\nFigure 7.

The dotted line is\nthe index [MgFe] as defined by Gonz\u00e1lez (1993).\n\n[MgFe]\u2032 \u2261\nteresting are the two most metal-rich clusters NGC 6528 and\nNGC 6553, which exhibit significantly stronger Mg2 than\npredicted by the Brodie & Huchra (1990) calibration. These\nclusters have almost solar metallicities, while the Brodie &\nHuchra (1990) calibration is based on globular clusters with\n[Z/H] < \u22120.5. A non-linear increase of Mg2 with increasing total metallicity at metallicities [Z/H] > \u22120.5, instead,\nis suggested by the data and consistently predicted by our\nSSP models (dotted line).\n\n3.2.3\n\nTracing metallicity independent of \u03b1/Fe\n\nThe new SSP models with variable \u03b1/Fe ratio allow for an\nunambiguous derivation of total metallicity and \u03b1/Fe ratio simultaneously, free from any \u03b1/Fe bias. Still, it would\nbe useful to find an index that is mainly a tracer of total\nmetallicity independent of the \u03b1/Fe ratio. Gonz\u00e1lez (1993)\nsuggested that averaging Mg and Fe indices may yield such\na metallicity indicator, and defined the index\n[MgFe] =\nwith\nhFei =\n\np\n\nMg b * hFei\n\n1\n(Fe5270 + Fe5335) .\n2\n\nIn Fig. 7 we plot the Lick indices Mg b and hFei of our\nSSP models as functions of \u03b1/Fe ratio at fixed total metallicity. Models with age 12 Gyr and solar metallicity are shown.\nMg b increases and hFei decreases with increasing \u03b1/Fe. The\nindex [MgFe] as defined by Gonz\u00e1lez (1993) is the dotted\nline. Although being only very little sensitive to \u03b1/Fe, still\n[MgFe] slightly decreases with increasing \u03b1/Fe.\nFrom Table 2 we know that Fe5270 responds less to\n\u03b1/Fe ratio changes than Fe5335. Decreasing the weight of\nFe5335 in the definition of [MgFe] thus helps to remove the\nsensitivity to \u03b1/Fe. We therefore slightly modify the definition of [MgFe] and define the new index\n\n15\n\np\n\nMg b (0.72 * Fe5270 + 0.28 * Fe5335) .\n\n(12)\n\n\u2032\n\nIn Fig. 7 it is shown that [MgFe] is indeed completely independent of \u03b1/Fe. We note that this behaviour is almost\nindependent of the adopted age and metallicity. Therefore\n[MgFe]\u2032 serves best as a tracer of the total metallicity of\nstellar populations.\n\n4\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe present a comprehensive set of new generation stellar\npopulation models of Lick absorption line indices, which for\nthe first time include abundance ratios different from solar.\nWe computed the 21 Lick indices CN1 , CN2 , Ca4227, G4300,\nFe4383, Ca4455, Fe4531, C2 4668, H\u03b2, Fe5015, Mg1 , Mg2 ,\nMg b, Fe5270, Fe5335, Fe5406, Fe5709, Fe5782, Na D, TiO1 ,\nand TiO2 in the wavelength range 4000 . \u03bb . 6500 \u00c5.\nModels are provided with: [\u03b1/Fe] = 0.0, 0.3, 0.5, [\u03b1/Ca] =\n\u22120.1, 0.0, 0.2, 0.5, and [\u03b1/N] = \u22120.5, 0.0; ages from 1 to\n15 Gyr; total metallicities from 1/200 to 3.5 solar (\u22122.25 6\n[Z/H] 6 0.67).\nThe models are based on the evolutionary synthesis\ntechnique described in Maraston (1998). The \u03b1/Fe enhanced\nmixtures are obtained by increasing the abundances of \u03b1group elements and by decreasing the abundances of the\nFe-peak elements, such that total metallicity is conserved.\nThe impact from these element abundance variations on the\nabsorption line indices is taken from Tripicco & Bell (1995),\nusing an extension of the method introduced by Trager et al.\n(2000). Most importantly, we take into account that the empirical stellar libraries used to compute model indices follow\nthe chemical enrichment history of the Milky Way, and are\ntherefore biased towards super-solar \u03b1/Fe ratios at sub-solar\nmetallicities. We corrected for this bias, so that the models\npresented here have well-defined \u03b1/Fe ratios at all metallicities.\nWe take particular care at calibrating the models with\ngalactic globular clusters, for which ages, metallicities, and\n\n\f16\n\nDaniel Thomas, Claudia Maraston, & Ralf Bender\n\nelement abundance ratios are known from independent\nsources. Our \u03b1/Fe enhanced models with [\u03b1/Fe] = 0.3 (and\n12 Gyr age) perfectly reproduce the positions of the globular\ncluster data in the Mg b-hFei diagram up to solar metallicities (see also Maraston et al. 2002). The total metallicities\nfor the sample clusters that we derive from these indices are\nin excellent agreement with the Zinn & West (1984) metallicity scale. We point out that the latter most likely reflects\ntotal metallicity rather than iron abundance, because it is\nobtained essentially by averaging the abundances derived\nfrom the Mg triplet near 5175 \u00c5 and the Fe blend at 5270 \u00c5\n(Cohen 1983; Zinn & West 1984). This aspect needs to be\nemphasized, as with the \u03b1/Fe enhanced models we are now\nin the position to distinguish total metallicity [Z/H] and iron\nabundance [Fe/H].\nBy means of our calibrated \u03b1/Fe enhanced models, we\nconfirm that the index [MgFe], suggested by Gonz\u00e1lez (1993)\nto balance \u03b1/Fe ratio effects, is almost independent of \u03b1/Fe.\nAs it modestly decreases with increasing \u03b1/Fe, however, we\ndefine the slightly modified index\n[MgFe]\u2032 \u2261\n\np\n\nMg b (0.72 * Fe5270 + 0.28 * Fe5335) ,\n\nwhich is completely independent of \u03b1/Fe, and hence an even\nbetter tracer of total metallicity. We further show that the\nlinear correlation between Mg2 and metallicity at old ages\nderived empirically by Brodie & Huchra (1990) is valid up\nto \u223c 1/3 solar metallicity, but underpredicts Mg2 indices at\nmetallicities above that threshold.\nIt turns out to be hard to find indices that correlate with\n\u03b1/Fe as well as the intensively studied indices Mg1 , Mg2 , and\nMg b. Promising alternatives are the blue indices CN1 and\nCN2 that also increase with increasing \u03b1/Fe ratio, mainly\nbecause of an anti-correlation with Fe abundance. With the\ncaveat that CN1 and CN2 are additionally sensitive to C and\nN abundances, they can be regarded to be complementary\nto the indices Mg1 , Mg2 , and Mg b. Alternatives to the iron\nindices Fe5270 and Fe5335, the strengths of which decrease\nwith increasing \u03b1/Fe ratio, are easier to find. The best cases\nare the indices Fe4383, Fe4531, Fe5015, and Fe5709.\nThe indices CN1 , CN2 , and Ca4227 of globular clusters are very interesting, particular cases. We find that the\nrelatively strong CN features observed in globular clusters\nrequire models in which nitrogen is enhanced by a factor\nthree relative to the \u03b1-elements, hence [\u03b1/N] = \u22120.5. This\nis in agreement with early suggestions by D'Antona et al.\n(1983) and Renzini (1983), that stars in globular clusters\nmay accrete carbon and/or nitrogen enriched ejecta from the\nsurrounding AGB stars (Renzini & Voli 1981). The good calibration of other indices like Mg1 , Mg b or hFei is not affected\nby a variation of the \u03b1/N ratio, as these indices are not sensitive to nitrogen abundance. We note that an enhancement\nof carbon abundance, instead, would lead to serious inconsistencies with Mg1 . Interestingly, also Ca4227 is sensitive\nto nitrogen abundance, and the globular cluster data of this\nindex are also best reproduced by the model with increased\nnitrogen abundance.\nTo conclude, the stellar population models presented\nhere make it possible, for the first time, to study in detail\nindividual element abundance ratios of unresolved stellar\npopulations. In particular, total metallicity is now a welldefined quantity. In an accompanying paper (D. Thomas et\n\nal., in preparation), we use these models to derive quantitatively \u03b1/Ca and Ca/Fe ratios of the stellar populations in\nelliptical galaxies from their Ca4227, Mg b, and hFei indices.\nInteresting for galaxy formation will also be to investigate\nelement abundance ratios of galaxies at earlier stages of their\nevolution. On the basis of the calibration carried out in this\npaper, we suggest that the combination of the blue Lick indices CN1 and Fe4383 may be best suited to estimate \u03b1/Fe\nratios of objects at redshifts z \u223c 1.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe would like to thank Laura Greggio for the numerous,\nvery fruitful discussions.

The models comprise the ages 1 to 15 Gyr,\nthe total metallicities \u22122.25 6 [Z/H] 6 0.67, and the\n\u03b1/Fe ratios [\u03b1/Fe] = 0.0 (Table A1), [\u03b1/Fe] = 0.3 (Table A2), and [\u03b1/Fe] = 0.5 (Table A3). These models\nhave [\u03b1/N] = 0 and [\u03b1/Ca] = 0. In a more comprehensive form (i.e., finer grid in ages and \u03b1/Fe ratios), they\nare also available electronically via ftp at ftp.mpe.mpg.de\nin the directory people/dthomas/SSPs or via WWW at\nftp://ftp.mpe.mpg.de/people/dthomas/SSPs.\n\nAPPENDIX B: N ENHANCED MODELS\nTable B1 contains SSP models of the indices CN1 , CN2 ,\nand Ca4227 in which the element nitrogen is enhanced by\na factor 3 ([\u03b1/N] = \u22120.5). The models comprise the same\nages, metallicities, and \u03b1/Fe ratios as in Tables A1 to A3.\n\nAPPENDIX C: MODELS WITH VARIABLE\n\u03b1/Ca RATIOS\nTable C1 contains SSP models of the index Ca4227 with the\n\u03b1/Ca ratios [\u03b1/Ca] = \u22120.1, 0.2, 0.5.
