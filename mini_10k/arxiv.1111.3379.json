We use cell decomposition techniques to study additive\nreducts of p-adic fields. We consider a very general class of fields, including fields with infinite residue fields, which we study using a multi-sorted\nlanguage. The results are used to obtain cell decomposition results for\nthe case of finite residue fields. We do not require fields to be Henselian,\nand we allow them to be of any characteristic.\n\n1. Introduction\nIt is hard to overstate the importance of cell decomposition techniques\nfor the study of o-minimal structures. The technique made it possible to\nobtain results for a wide array of topics, ranging from the study of definable\ninvariants to differentiability of definable functions, see eg. van den Dries\n[22] for details.\nAnother example is the classification of reducts of (R, +, *, <) by Peterzil\n[14, 19, 18] and others. One of the most striking results he obtained is\nthe fact that there exists only a single structure between the structure of\nsemi-algebraic sets and the semi-linear sets of (R, +, {\u03bba }a\u2208R ): a structure\nwhere multiplication is definable only on a bounded interval. The question\nwhether a similar result would exist in the p-adic context was one of the\nmotivations for this paper: a good understanding of semi-affine structures\nis a necessary first step towards answering this question. In the upcoming\npapers [11, 10] we will report our findings.\nFor p-adic structures, a number of cell decomposition results do exist.\nProbably the most well-known is the cell decomposition result for semialgebraic sets by Denef [6], which allowed him to give a new proof of Macintyre's quantifier elimination result [13], and which has been a very useful\ntool in the study of p-adic integrals , see eg Denef [6] or Cluckers and the\nauthor [2]. Haskell and Macpherson [8] developed P -minimality as a p-adic\nalternative to o-minimality, to study (expansions) of p-adically closed fields.\nIt was shown later by Mourgues [15] that such structures admit cell decomposition (using Mourgues definition of cells) if and only if they have definable\nSkolem functions.\nMost existing p-adic cell decomposition results focus on (expansions of)\nthe semi-algebraic structure. This poses a complication for obtaining padic equivalents of Peterzil's result, because there does not really exist a\n1\n\n\f2\n\nEVA LEENKNEGT\n\nminimality theory for weak p-adic structures. In a previous paper [3] we\nproposed to consider all structures (K, L), where K is a p-adic field and\nthe L-definable subsets of K are the same as the Lring -definable subsets\nof K. This is a direct p-adic equivalent of o-minimal reducts of (R, +, *, <\n). Unfortunately, we were unable to prove whether such structures would\nalways admit some form of cell decomposition. We gave a few suggestions\nin [9], but it seems to be rather difficult even to suggest a useful general\nnotion of cells, so a general cell decomposition theorem for such structures\nstill seems inaccessible.\nA natural first step is to study the properties of individual structures.\nIn [9] we consider some very weak structures (where even addition is not\ndefinable everywhere), and in this paper we will look at the p-adic equivalent\nof semi-linear sets. Some time ago, Liu [12] obtained a cell decomposition\nfor the semi-linear structure (Qp ; +, \u2212, {c}c\u2208Qp , {Pn }n ), where c is a symbol\nfor scalar multiplication x 7\u2192 cx, and the Pn are the nonzero n-th powers.\nThis paper describes similar structures, but in a more general context.\nWe will consider structures (K, L), where L is a semi-affine language\nand where K is a Z-field: a valued field that satisfies the following extra\nconditions. Write \u0393K for the value group, and let RK be the valuation ring\nof K.\nDefinition 1.1. A Z-field is a valued field K that contains an element \u03c0\nof minimal positive valuation. Further, we require that \u0393K is a Z-group\n(that is, \u0393K /Z is divisible) and that there exist angular component maps\nac\u03c0m : K \u2192 RK /\u03c0 m RK .\nWe will assume that the valuation is normalized such that ord \u03c0 = 1.\nThe required angular component maps always exist if \u0393K = Z and K has\na uniformizing element \u03c0. The proof is similar to the proof of Lemma 3.2.\nNote that we do not put any conditions on the residue field FK and the\ncharacteristic of K. Moreover, we do not require the field K to be Henselian.\nWhen studying structures on valued fields, often multi-sorted languages\nare considered, typically consisting of a field sort and various other, auxiliary\nsorts used to encode information concerning the residue field and angular\ncomponents. See for example Pas [16, 17], who used multi-sorted languages\nto study semi-algebraic structures for fields with infinite residue fields. This\napproach was extended to fields with analytic structure by Cluckers, Lipshitz\nand Robinson [4]. Other recent examples include Scanlon, who used a multisorted language to study valued D-fields [20], and Cluckers and Loeser [5],\nwho obtain cell decomposition for henselian valued fields of characteristic\nzero.\nMost of the examples given above are essentially multi-sorted versions\nof (extensions of) the language of valued fields. We present a multi-sorted\nlanguage where full multiplication is not definable, but such that 'multiplicative' relations like the valuation of x modulo n are still definable. (This\n\n\fCELL DECOMPOSITION FOR SEMI-AFFINE STRUCTURES ON p-ADIC FIELDS\n\n3\n\nrelation is equivalent to x being in certain cosets of the set of nth powers.) The valued field K will be the main sort, equipped with the language\n(+, *\u03c0 , |). The function *\u03c0 is defined as\n*\u03c0 : K \u2192 K : x 7\u2192 \u03c0x.\nThe divisibility relation | is defined as x | y iff ord x 6 ord y.\nThe auxiliary sorts \u039bn,m are constructed as follows. Since \u0393K is a Zgroup, there exist maps \u03b3n : K \u00d7 \u2192 {0, . . . , n \u2212 1}, where \u03b3n (x) is the\nremainder of ord x after division by n. For every x \u2208 K \u00d7 , put\n\u03c1n,m (x) = \u03c0 \u03b3n (x) ac\u03c0m (x).\nExtend this to K by putting \u03c1n,m (0) = 0. Our auxiliary sorts will then be\nthe sets of equivalence classes:\n\u039bn,m := {\u03c1n,m (x) | x \u2208 K}.\nThe maps \u03c1n,m project the main sort K onto the auxiliary sorts \u039bn,m .\nThe language on the auxiliary sorts contains no symbols. Schematically, this\ngives us the following language L\u03c0aff :\nK (+, *\u03c0 , |)\n\u03c1n,m\n\n\u000f\n\n{\u039bn,m }n,m\nNote that this language does not use the value group as a seperate sort.\nHowever, the sets \u039bn,m retain information on the value group, modulo an\ninteger n. Let us give some examples of relations that are definable in this\nlanguage.\nLemma 1.2. Let K be a Z-field. For every k, n \u2208 N, the following subsets\nof K are L\u03c0aff -definable:\n(1) {(x, y) \u2208 K 2 | ord x = ord y}\n(2) {x \u2208 K | ord x \u2261 k mod n}\nProof. The relation ord x = ord y is equivalent with x | y \u2227 \u00ac(\u03c0x | y). We\ncan use this to express that ord x = \u03b3 for any \u03b3 \u2208 \u03b3K by substituting y for a\nsuitable constant from K. For \u03bb \u2208 \u039bn,m we can then express that ord \u03bb \u2261 k\nmod n in the following way:\nord \u03bb \u2261 k\n\nmod n \u2194 (\u2203x \u2208 K)[\u03c1n,m (x) = \u03bb and ord x = k].\n\nWe can now use the formula\n(\u2203\u03bb \u2208 \u039bn,m )[(ord \u03bb \u2261 k mod n) and \u03c1n,m (x) = \u03bb].\nto define the set consisting of all x \u2208 K such that ord x \u2261 k mod n.\n\n\u0003\n\nIf K is a Z-field with infinite residuefield, the set {x \u2208 K | ord x \u2261 k\nmod n} cannot be defined in L\u03c0aff without using K-quantifiers. To remedy\n\n\f4\n\nEVA LEENKNEGT\n\nthis, we expand the language in Section 2.1, thus obtaining an additive variant of the language studied by Pas. In Section 2.3 and 2.4, we show that\n\u03c0 .\nd\nZ-fields admit elimination of K-quantifiers in this extended language L\naff\nThe proof uses cell decomposition techniques. We also give a characterization of the definable functions f : K n \u2192 K m .\nIn Section 3, we restrict our attention to fields with finite residue field.\nFor such fields, we can 'collapse' the multisorted language to a language\nwith just one sort, and derive cell decomposition and quantifier elimination\nfrom the results we obtained for the multisorted language.\nTo make the distinction between mono- and multisorted languages clear,\nwe will use the following terminology. The definable sets of our multi-sorted\nlanguage are called 'semi-additive' sets. We will refer to the mono-sorted\nlanguages we deduce from this as 'semi-affine' languages. 'Semi-linear' sets\nare the definable sets of the structure Liu studied on Qp . We will compare our results for semi-affine sets with existing results for semi-linear and\nsemi-algebraic sets. In particular, we give a characterization of definable\nfunctions in Section 3.1, and in Section 3.2, we give some examples to show\nthat classification by definable bijection is not quite as simple as it is for\nsemi-algebraic sets. (It was shown by Cluckers [1] that any two infinite padic semi-algebraic sets are isomorphic if and only if they have the same\ndimension.)\n2. Affine structures with infinite residue field\n\u03c0 . Let K be a valued field\nd\n2.1. Definition of the languages L\u03c0aff and L\naff\nwith value group \u0393K and valuation ring RK . Let \u03c0 be an element \u03c0 of\nminimal positive valuation, such that ord \u03c0 = 1. We use the notation ac\u03c0m\nfor the angular component maps ac\u03c0m : K \u2192 RK /\u03c0 m RK .\nThe only symbol for multiplication we included in L\u03c0aff is *\u03c0 . However, as\naddition is definable, scalar multiplication by every n \u2208 N is definable. This\nimplies that if K has characteristic zero, multiplication by every c \u2208 Q(\u03c0)\nis definable. If char(K)=p, we can define scalar multiplication for every\nc \u2208 Fp (\u03c0).\nIn general, if we denote the prime field of K by PK , we can thus define a\nscalar multiplication map c : K \u2192 K : x 7\u2192 cx for every c \u2208 PK .\nWe added the symbol *\u03c0 because of the functions it induces on the auxiliary sets. We do not include symbols for scalar multiplication by other\nconstants, as we want to keep the language as basic as possible. However, it\nis possible to define variations on L\u03c0aff that contain a wider range of symbols\nfor scalar multiplication. It is easy to see that such languages can be studied\nin a similar way as L\u03c0aff . In fact, we refer to these related languages when\nwe consider the case of finite residue fields.\n(n,m)\nThe addition map for the main sort K induces addition functions +r\non the auxiliary sorts \u039bn,m , where r \u2208 N is such that rn < m. If rn <=\nord xy < (r + 1)n (and some additional conditions if r = 0), these functions\n\n\fCELL DECOMPOSITION FOR SEMI-AFFINE STRUCTURES ON p-ADIC FIELDS\n\n5\n\nare designed to satisfy the relation\n\u03c1n,m (x + y) = \u03c1n,m (x) +n,m\n\u03c1n,m (y).\nr\nWhy do we need to consider multiple addition functions on the auxiliary\nsorts? To see this, let us compare with a similar construction in a different\nlanguage. In [7], Flenner considers a language with auxiliary sorts\nRV\u03b3 := K \u00d7 \\(1 + M\u03b3 ),\nwhere M\u03b3 = {x \u2208 RK | ord x > \u03b3}. The quotient map, which is denoted\nrv\u03b3 := K \u00d7 7\u2192 RV\u03b3 , induces an addition function \u2295\u03b3 on each sort RV\u03b3 , that\nis compatible with the addition in the main sort, in the sense that\nrv\u03b3 (x + y) = rv\u03b3 (x) \u2295\u03b3 rv\u03b3 (y),\nfor all x, y for which ord (x + y) = min{ord x, ord y}.\nIf this condition is not satisfied, the operation \u2295 is not welldefined, since\nthen rv\u03b3 (x + y) depends on the representatives x and y, and not only on\nrv\u03b3 (x) and rv\u03b3 (y). To define the value of \u03bb1 \u2295\u03b3 \u03bb2 for \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 \u2208 RV\u03b3 , one\nchooses representatives xi such that rv\u03b3 (xi ) = \u03bbi , and then puts \u03bb1 \u2295\u03b3 \u03bb2 :=\nrv\u03b3 (x1 + x2 ). If ord (x1 + x2 ) = min{ord x1 , ord x2 }, this value does not\ndepend on the chosen representatives, so this addition is well-defined.\nThe main difference between the sorts RV\u03b3 and the sorts \u039bn,m is that\nrv\u03b3 (x) remembers the order of x, while \u03c1n,m (x) only retains the order modulo\nn. Hence we will have to be more careful, since every equivalence class in\n\u039bn,m contains representatives with different orders. Let \u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 \u2208 \u039bn,m and\nsuppose that we want to define \u03bb \u2295 \u03bb\u2032 . The outcome will depend on the\ndistance of the chosen representatives, by the followning lemma:\nLemma 2.1. Put \u03b4 \u2208 {\u22121, 1}. Suppose\nthen \u03c1n,m (a + \u03b4b) equals\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\u03bb\n\u03c1n,m (\u03bb + \u03b4\u03bc\u03c0 rn ), with rn = ord ( \u03bca\n\u03bbb )\n\uf8f3\n\u03c1n,m (\u03bb + \u03b4\u03bc)\n\nthat \u03c1n,m (a) = \u03bb and \u03c1n,m (b) = \u03bc,\nif m + ord a 6 ord b,\nif \u2212m + ord b < ord a < ord b,\nif ord a = ord b = ord (a + \u03b4b).\n\nProof. Left as an exercise.\n\n\u0003\n\nIf we want to define addition maps, we will have to take these different\npossibilities into account. Not that this is a bad thing: this means that we\ncan use the auxiliary sorts \u039bn,m to encode information about the distance\nbetween elements of K. This will be important when we want to achieve\ncell decomposition.\nLet us now give a precise definition of the addition maps +rn,m .

Cell Decomposition. The following notation will be convenient. Let\nD \u2286 \u039brn,m \u00d7 K k be a definable set, and suppose that r \u2032 6 r, k\u2032 6 k and\n\u2032\n\u2032\nk\u2032 + r \u2032 < k + r. For any (\u03c1, b) \u2208 \u039brn,m \u00d7 K k , the notation D(\u03c1, b) denotes\nthe set\n\u2032\nr\u2212r \u2032\nD(\u03c1, b) := {(\u03bb, x) \u2208 \u039bn,m\n\u00d7 K k\u2212k | (\u03c1, \u03bb, b, x) \u2208 D}.\nWe next define our notion of cells.

However, in the expressions in (b) of Subsection 2.2, we also\nused '6' and '='. We can exclude these options since they can be expressed\nin terms of a strict inequality.

Let C1 , C2 be two cells in \u039brn,m \u00d7 K k+1 . The intersection\nC1 \u2229 C2 can be partitioned as a finite union of cells.\nProof. First consider semi-cells of the following form:\nCcD (a1 , a2 ) := {(\u03bb, x, t) \u2208 D \u00d7 K | ord a1 (x) \u00031 ord (t \u2212 c(x)) \u00032 ord a2 (x)},\nUsing the ultrametric property of the valutation, it is easy to see that the\nintersection of two semi-cells CcD1 1 (a1 , a2 ) and CcD2 2 (b1 , b2 ) can be partitioned\nas a finite union of sets A, such that either A is the set of all (\u03bb, x, t) \u2208 D\u00d7K\non which\n(2)\n\nord (t \u2212 c1 (x)) = ord (t \u2212 c2 (x)) = ord (c1 (x) \u2212 c2 (x)),\n\nwith D a subset of \u039brn,m \u00d7 K k , definable without K-quantifiers,\nor A is a semi-cell CcE (e1 , e2 ), with the center c(x) equal to c1 (x) or c2 (x),\nsuch that one of the following is true on A:\n(3)\n(4)\n\nord (t \u2212 c(x)) > ord (c1 (x) \u2212 c2 (x)),\nord (t \u2212 c(x)) < ord (c1 (x) \u2212 c2 (x)).\n\nA set that satisfies one of those 3 conditions, say condition (l), will be\nreferred to as a set of type (l). A general cell CcD (a1 , a2 , D\u03c1 ) has the form:\n\u001a\n\u001b\nord a1 (x) \u00031 ord (t \u2212 c(x)) \u00032 ord a2 (x),\n(\u03bb, x, t) \u2208 D \u00d7 K\nand \u03c1n,m (t \u2212 c(x)) \u2208 D\u03c1 (x, \u03bb)\n(2)\n\n(1)\n\nWe want to intersect two cells CcD1 1 (a1 , a2 , D\u03c1 ) and CcD2 2 (b1 , b2 , D\u03c1 ).

After a straightforward further partitioning we may\n(i)\nsuppose that t \u2212 c1 and t \u2212 c2 are both nonzero, and thus that 0 6\u2208 D\u03c1 (\u03bb, x)\nfor any (\u03bb, x) \u2208 Di .\n\nThe first part of the above intersection is A(2) \u2229 Q.

The graph of a definable function is a semi-additive set, so the graph\nof f can be partitioned as in Definition 2.6, using a finite number of cells\nCi . The fact that f is a function, implies that for each cell Ci , and any\nx \u2208 DK , there exists a unique t \u2208 K such that (x, t) \u2208 Graph(f ). Note\nhowever, that this uniqueness condition implies that t = c(x) and thus the\nfunction f , when restricted to DK , simply maps each x to the center c(x)\nof the corresponding cell Ci , which we assumed to be a (PK (\u03c0), K)-linear\npolynomial.\n\u0003\n\n\fCELL DECOMPOSITION FOR SEMI-AFFINE STRUCTURES ON p-ADIC FIELDS 13\n\n3. The case of a finite residue field\nFor the following class of fields, angular component maps can be defined in\na unique way. Note that we do not require the valued field to be Henselian.\nDefinition 3.1. Let Fq be the finite field with q elements and Z the ordered\nabelian group of integers. We define a (Fq , Z)-field to be a valued field with\nresidue field isomorphic to Fq and value group elementary equivalent to Z.\nFix an (Fq , Z)-field K, fix an element \u03c0 with smallest positive order, such\nthat ord \u03c0 = 1. For each integer n > 0, let Pn be the set of nonzero n-th\npowers in K.\nLemma 3.2. For each integer m > 0, there is a unique group homomorphism\nac\u03c0m : K \u00d7 \u2192 (RK mod \u03c0 m )\u00d7\nsuch that ac\u03c0m (\u03c0) = 1 and such that ac\u03c0m (u) \u2261 u mod \u03c0 m for any unit\nu \u2208 RK .\n\u00d7\n. Note that\nProof. Put Nm := (q \u2212 1)q m\u22121 and let U be the set PNm * RK\nK \u00d7 equals the finite disjoint union of the sets \u03c0 l * U for integers l with\n0 6 l 6 Nm \u2212 1. Hence, any element y of K \u00d7 can be written as a product\n\u00d7\n, l \u2208 {0, . . . , Nm \u2212 1}, and x \u2208 K \u00d7 .\nof the form \u03c0 l xNm u, with u \u2208 RK\nSince ac\u03c0m is required to be a group homomorphism to a finite group\nwith Nm elements, it must send PNm to 1. Also note that the projection\nRK \u2192 RK mod \u03c0 m (which is a ring homomorphism), induces a natural\n\u00d7\n\u2192 (RK mod \u03c0 m )\u00d7 . Now if we write y =\ngroup homomorphism p : RK\nl\nN\nm\n\u03c0 x u, we see that ac\u03c0m must satisfy\n\n(10)\n\nac\u03c0m (y) = p(u),\n\nwhich implies that the map ac\u03c0m is uniquely determined if it exists. Moreover, we claim that we can use (10) to define ac\u03c0m . This is certainly a\nwell defined group homomorphism: if one writes y = \u03c0 l x\u0303Nm \u0169 for some\n\u00d7\nand x\u0303 \u2208 K \u00d7 , then clearly p(u) = p(\u0169). It is also clear\nother \u0169 \u2208 RK\nthat this homomorphism sends \u03c0 to 1 and satisfies our requirement that\nac\u03c0m (u) \u2261 u mod \u03c0 m for any unit u \u2208 RK .\n\u0003\n(Fq , Z)-fields satisfy the requirements we listed in the introduction, so\nif we consider the structure induced by our multi-sorted language, we can\napply the cell decomposition results from the previous section. Obviously,\nsince the residue field is now assumed to be finite, \u039bn,m will be a finite set.\nIn fact, we can assume that \u039bn,m is a subset of RK , by choosing a fixed set\nof representatives for each equivalence class. For example, if K = Qp , we\ncould take\n\u039bn,m := {pr a | 0 6 r < n \u2227 ord a = 0 \u2227 0 < a 6 pm \u2212 1}.\nThe fact that \u039bn,m is finite implies that all \u039bn,m -quantifiers can be replaced\nby conjunctions (for \u2200) and disjunctions (for \u2203) over the elements of \u039bn,m .\n\n\f14\n\nEVA LEENKNEGT\n\nIn particular, if we consider the 2-variable relation\nSn,m(x, z) \u2194 \u03c1n,m (x) = \u03c1n,m (z)),\n\u03c0 to a mono-sorted language L\nd\nit is possible to 'collapse' L\naff := (+, \u2212, *\u03c0 , |, {Sn,m }n,m ).\naff\nIt follows immediately from the results of the previous section that every\ndefinable set in this new language is a finite union of cells of the form\n(11)\n{(x, t) \u2208 D\u00d7K | ord a1 (x) \u00031 ord (t\u2212c(x)) \u00032 ord a2 (x) \u2227 \u03c1n,m (t\u2212c(x)) = \u03bb},\n\nwith D a quantifierfree definable subset of K k , \u03bb \u2208 \u039bn,m ; ai (x) and c(x) are\n(PK (\u03c0), K)-linear polynomials, and PK is the prime subfield of K.\nWe should compare this with the semi-linear language (+, \u2212{c}c\u2208Qp , {Pn }n\u2208N )\nthat Liu [12] considered for Qp . A first difference is the use of the relation\nSn,m, instead of the sets of n-th powers Pn . This difference is much smaller\nthan it may seem at first. If we define Qn,m to be the set\nQn,m := {x \u2208 K | \u03c1n,m (x) = \u03c1n,m (1)}\nthen the relation Sn,m(x, y) is equivalent to x \u2208 yQn,m . Hence, we replaced\nexpressions like 'x is in some coset of Pn ' by similar expressions that use\nsets Qn,m instead. However, for Henselian (Fq , Z)-fields, it is easy to see\nthat for any N \u2208 N, PN can be defined as a finite union of cosets \u03bbQn,m\nwith \u03bb \u2208 K; n, m \u2208 N. Since we used cosets of PN to define the maps ac\u03c0m\n(and thus the sets Qn,m ), the converse is also true.\nAnother (seeming) difference is that the language we defined contains the\ndivisibility symbol '|'. Liu does not include this symbol, since he showed\nthat for semi-linear sets over Qp , this relation is quantifierfree definable.\nWe need the symbol if we want to achieve quantifier elimination, but it\ncan be shown, see [3, Proposition 1], that for (Fq , Z)-fields, the relation\nord (x \u2212 z) < ord (y \u2212 z) is definable whenever the relation \u03c1n,m (y \u2212 x) =\n\u03c1n,m (z) is definable. So adding the symbol to our language does not affect\nthe number of definable sets.\nA third difference lies in the amount of scalar multiplication which is definable. Laff has less scalar multiplication than the semi-linear language. (To\ncompare: for the structure (Qp ; +, \u2212, *\u03c0 , {Sn,m }n,m ), scalar multiplication is\nonly definable for constants from Q.) This difference will be important when\nwe compare the definable functions.\nTaking these observations into account, we can consider a class of semiaffine structures:\nDefinition 3.3. Given an (Fq , Z)-field K and a subfield L \u2286 K, let LL\naff be\nthe language\nLL\naff := (+, \u2212, {c}c\u2208L , |, {Rn,m }n,m ).\nThe structure (K, LL\naff ) is called a semi-affine structure.\n\n\fCELL DECOMPOSITION FOR SEMI-AFFINE STRUCTURES ON p-ADIC FIELDS 15\n\nThese languages are variations on the language Laff we defined above,\nadding additional symbols for scalar multiplication, and replacing the symbol Sn,m by Rn,m , a relation which is defined as Rn,m (x, y, z) \u2194 \u03c1n,m (y\u2212x) =\n\u03c1n,m (z). We make this (otherwise unnecessary) substitution to point out the\nlink with the language ({Rn,m }n,m ), that we studied in [3].\nQ\nOver Qp , Liu's semi-linear language is equivalent with Laffp . Note also\nP (\u03c0)\nthat the structures (K, LaffK ) and (K, Laff ) have the same definable sets.\nIn general, when considering a structue (K, L), we will always assume that\nif multiplication by c is definable, then L contains a symbol c (replacing\nL by a definitional expansion if necessary). In particular, we assume that\nPK \u2286 L.\nTo describe the definable sets and functions of such structures, the following terminology is useful.\nDefinition 3.4. Let L \u2286 K be fields. An (L, K)-linear polynomial is a\npolynomial of the form\na1 x1 + . . . + an xn + b,\n\nwith ai \u2208 L and b \u2208 K.\n\nIf L = LL\naff , we write Polyk (L, K) for the set of all (L, K)-linear polynomials\nin k variables.\nFor all semi-affine structures (K, L), we can deduce cell decomposition\nand quantifier elimination, using the method we described for the language\nLaff . The general idea is this: the cell decomposition results from the previ\u03c0 , where we have more\nd\nous section still hold if we consider variations of L\naff\n(or less) symbols for scalar multiplication to the language of the field sort.\nEvery semi-affine language can be obtained by collapsing such a language to\na language having only the field sort. In each case, we obtain cell decomposition using cells as in (11), where the only difference is that for (K, LL\naff ), the\nfunctions ai (x) and c(x) will now be (L, K)-linear polynomials. (Assuming\nthat scalar multiplication is only definable for constants from L.) From this,\nthe following description of definable cells can easily be deduced:\nLemma 3.5. The definable sets of a semi-affine structure (K, L) are the\nboolean combinations of sets of the forms\n{x \u2208 K k | ord f1 (x) \u0003 ord \u03c0 r f2 (x)}\n\nand\n\n{x \u2208 K k | \u03c1n,m (f3 (x)) = \u03bb},\n\nwhere the fi \u2208 Polyk (L, K), r \u2208 Z and \u03bb \u2208 \u039bn,m .\nIn the next section we study the definable functions for these languages.\n3.1. Definable functions and Skolem functions. The definable functions of a semi-affine structure (K, L) will be called L-semiaffine functions\nQ\nover K. The definable sets and functions of (Qp , Laffp ) will be referred to\nas being 'semi-linear'. Using cell decomposition, it is easy to see that semiaffine functions actually have a very simple form.\n\n\f16\n\nEVA LEENKNEGT\n\nLemma 3.6. Let (K, L) be a semi-affine structure. For any L-semiaffine\nfunction A \u2286 K k \u2192 K l there exists a finite partition of A in L-definable\nsets Bi , such that f|Bi has the form\nf|Bi : Bi \u2192 K l : x 7\u2192 (f1 (x), . . . , fl (x)),\nwith fl (x) \u2208 Polyk (L, K).\nAll of these semi-affine structures are truly linear in the sense that there\ndoes not exist any open set where multiplication is definable.\nCorollary 3.7. Let K be any (Fq , Z)-field and L a semi-affine language.\nLet U \u2286 K 2 be an open semi-affine set. The map f : U \u2192 K : (x, y) 7\u2192 xy\nis not a semi-affine function.\nProof. Let us assume that scalar multiplication is definable for all c \u2208 K, and\nthat multiplication is definable on an open cell C. Fix a point (x0 , y0 ) \u2208 C.\nIt is easy to see that if we choose k \u2208 N big enough, we have that\n(12)\n\n{(x, y) \u2208 K 2 | x \u2208 x0 + \u03c0 k RK , y \u2208 y0 + \u03c0 k Rk } \u2282 C.\n\nIf ord x0 6 ord y0 , there exists \u03b1 \u2208 RK such that y0 = \u03b1x0 . Moreover,\nbecause of (12), the intersection\nW := C \u2229 {(x, y) \u2208 K 2 | y = \u03b1x}\nis an infinite set, and the projection \u03c0x (W ) onto the first coordinate also\ncontains infinitely many points. Note that since xy = \u03b1x2 for (x, y) \u2208 W ,\nthe multiplication map on W induces a definable function \u03c0x (W ) \u2192 K :\nx 7\u2192 \u03b1x2 .\nAfter some (finite) further partitioning, we can find an open subset U \u2286\n\u03c0x (W ) and constants b1 , b2 such that on U , the function f (x) = b1 x + b2\ndefines the map x 7\u2192 \u03b1x2 . But this implies that the equation b1 x + b2 = \u03b1x2\nhas infinitely many solutions, which is a contradiction. If ord x0 > ord y0 ,\nwe can give a similar argument by intersecting with the set {x = \u03b11 y}. \u0003\nA question one can pose concerning semi-affine functions is whether it is\nalways possible to find a definable Skolem function, i.e. a definable choice\nin the fibers of f . As is the case for semi-algebraic functions (see [21]), the\nanswer is certainly 'yes' for semilinear functions, and more generally, for\nfunctions definable in a structure (K, LK\naff ).\nTheorem 3.8. Let X \u2286 K k+r be an LK\naff -definable set.\nk\nIf \u03c0k (X) \u2286 K is the projection on the first k variables, there exists a\nsemilinear function g : \u03c0k (X) \u2192 X such that \u03c0k \u25e6 g = Id\u03c0k (X) .\nProof.

Let C be a\ncell of the form\nC = {(x, t) \u2208 D \u00d7 K | ord b(x) \u00031 ord t \u00032 ord a(x) \u2227 \u03c1n,m (t) = \u03bb},\nwhere a(x), b(x) \u2208 K[x] and D \u2286 K l is a definable set.

Our\nstrategy is based on the fact that for every x \u2208 D, there exists k \u2208 Z such\nthat k satisfies\nord b(x) \u00031 ord \u03bb + kn < ord a(x).\nRestricting to a set D\u03bc , we construct an element t(x) with order as close as\npossible to ord a(x). This ensures that t(x) satisfies (13). The definiton of\ng on D\u03bc will depend on the respective orders of \u03bb and \u03bc.\n\u2022 If ord \u03bb < ord \u03bc, we can define g|D\u03bc as g|D\u03bc : D\u03bc \u2192 C : x 7\u2192\n\u0011\n\u0010\nx, \u03bc\u03bb a(x) . This means that we put t(x) = \u03bc\u03bb a(x). Clearly \u03c1n,m (t(x)) =\n\u03bb. Also, since \u2212n < ord ( \u03bc\u03bb ) < 0, we have that 0 < ord a(x)\nt(x) < n, and\nthus condition (13) must be satisfied.\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2022 If ord \u03bb > ord \u03bc, put gD\u03bc : D\u03bc \u2192 C : x 7\u2192 x, \u03c0\u03bbn \u03bc a(x) .\n\nIf \u00031 = '<' and \u00032 = 'no condition', we choose t(x) with order as close as\npossible to\u0010ord b(x).

After partitioning \u03c01 (A) in cells C, the\nfunction g must have the form\ng|C : C \u2192 K 2 : x 7\u2192 (x, ax + b),\nwhere ax + b is a (Q, K)-linear polynomial, and hence a \u2208 Q. There must\nbe at least one cell C that contains elements x for which ord x < ord ab . For\nthese elements, ord ax + b = ord ax. However, since ord p > ord \u03c0 = 1 and\nord a \u2208 (ord p)Z, it is impossible that ord a = 1, which is a contradiction. \u0003\nIn general, (K, LL\naff ) will admit definable skolem functions if for any n, m \u2208\nN and for any coset \u03bbQn,m , there exists a element \u03bb0 \u2208 K with \u03c1n,m (\u03bb0 ) = \u03bb\nand 0 6 ord \u03bb0 < n such that scalar multiplication by \u03bb0 is definable. This\ncondition is satisfied for p-adically closed fields if we require that QK \u2286 L,\nwhere QK is the algebraic closure of Q in K.\n3.2. Classification. Write qK for the cardinality of the residue field of K.\n\u2212ord (xi )\n.\nLet | * | be the norm defined as |x| = max(|xi |K ), where |xi |K = qK\nWe can define a dimension invariant for semi-affine structures by using the\nnotion of dimension that Scowcroft and van den Dries [21] introduced for\nsemi-algebraic sets, i.e., the dimension of a definable set X is the greatest\nnatural number n such that there exists a non-empty definable subset A \u2286 X\nand a definable bijection from A to a nonempty definable open subset of K n .\nIt is straightforward, using cell decomposition and our characterization of\ndefinable functions, to check that this notion of dimension has the expected\nproperties when applied to the context of semi-affine sets.\nCluckers [1] showed that two infinite p-adic semi-algebraic sets are isomorphic (i.e. there exists a definable bijection) if and only if they have the same\ndimension. There exists no analogous result for the semi-affine case, however. We will illustrate this fact with some examples. Although most results\npresented below are true for all (Fq , Z)-fields, we will restrict our attention\nto K = Qp .\nLemma 3.10. There exists no semi-affine bijection between the sets\nA = {t \u2208 Qp |ord t < 0}\n\nand\n\nB = {t \u2208 Qp |ord t > 0}.\n\nProof. Suppose such a bijection f : A \u2192 B exists. Then there must exist a\nfinite partition of A in sets Ai such that f is linear on each Ai . Since this\npartition is finite, at least one of these sets Ai must contain a subset of the\nform\nCi = {t \u2208 Qp | ord t < \u2212k \u2227 \u03c1n,m (t) = \u03bb},\nwith k \u2208 N. By our assumption, there must exist a \u2208 Q and b \u2208 Qp such that\non Ai , the map f|Ai has the form f|Ai : x 7\u2192 ax + b. If f is indeed a bijection,\nthen f (Ci ) must be a subset of B, and thus the condition ord f (x) > 0 has\n\n\fCELL DECOMPOSITION FOR SEMI-AFFINE STRUCTURES ON p-ADIC FIELDS 19\n\nto hold for all x \u2208\u0001 Ci . However,\nit is possible to take x \u2208 Ci such that\n\u0001\n\u0003\nord x < min{ord ab , ord a1 }. But then ord f (x) = ord (ax + b) < 0.\n\nOther examples of non-isomorphic sets of the same dimension are the sets\nPn . To obtain this result, we will first look at the sets Qn,m . For most pairs\n(n, m), the sets Qn,m are essentially different. More precisely, there exists\n\u2032\nan isomorphism between Qn,m and Qn\u2032 ,m\u2032 if and only if n\u2032 = npm\u2212m . To\nprove this, we first need the following lemma. (Note: We use the notation\nA \u2294 B to denote the disjoint union of two sets A and B. In practice this can\nbe defined as {0} \u00d7 A \u222a {1} \u00d7 B.)\nLemma 3.11. There exists no semi-affine bijection between\nG\nG\nQn,m\nQn,m\nand\ni\u2208I2\n\ni\u2208I1\n\nif I1 and I2 are index sets with different cardinalities.\n\n(j)\n\nProof. For j \u2208 I1 , we denote the different copies of Qn,m by Qn,m . Suppose\na semi-affine bijection\nG\nG\nQn,m\nQn,m \u2192\nf:\ni\u2208I1\n\ni\u2208I2\n\n(j)\n\ndoes exist. Then there must exist a finite partition of the Qn,m in cells C\n(j)\nsuch that f|C is linear. Since we take finite partitions, for each Qn,m , there\nmust be at least one cell of the form {x \u2208 Qp | ord x < k, x \u2208 \u03bbij Qnij ,mij }.\nIn fact, after a further finite partition, weFmay suppose that nij and mij are\nequal for each cell, and thus that all x \u2208 i\u2208I1 Qn,m with order smaller than\nsome fixed integer k belong to a set in the partition which has the form\n(j)\n\nCk,\u03bb := {x \u2208 Qp | ord x < k, x \u2208 \u03bbQn\u2032 ,m\u2032 }.\nBecause of the previous lemma, we will have to map the F\nelements of these\ncells to the elements with very small (negative) order of i\u2208I2 Qn,m to get\na bijection.\nIt is easy to see that if k < ord ( ab ) \u2212 m\u2032 , a function x 7\u2192 ax + b gives a\n(j)\n\n(j \u2032 )\n\nbijection between Ck,\u03bb to Ck+ord a,a\u03bb .\n\nF\n(j)\n(j)\nIf we choose k \u2208 Z small enough, then every set Ck,\u03bb \u2282 j\u2208I1 Qn,m is\nF\n(j \u2032 )\n(j \u2032 )\nmapped to a set Ck\u2032 ,\u03bb \u2282 j \u2032 \u2208I2 Qn,m. Also, for small enough k\u2032 \u2208 Z, every\n(j \u2032 )\n\n(j)\n\nset Ck\u2032 ,\u03bb is in the image of exactly one set Ck,\u03bb . So if f is the required\nF\nF\n(j)\n(j \u2032 )\nbijection, then for a small enough value of l, j\u2208I1 Qn,m and j \u2032 \u2208I2 Qn,m\ncontain exactly the same number of sets of the form {x \u2208 Qp | ord x < l, x \u2208\n\u03bbQn\u2032 ,m\u2032 }, which is only possible if I1 and I2 have the same cardinality. \u0003\nCorollary 3.12. There exists a semi-affine bijection between Qn,m and\n\u2032\nQn\u2032 ,m\u2032 if and only if n\u2032 = npm\u2212m .\n\n\f20\n\nEVA LEENKNEGT\n\nProof. Suppose m = max{m, m\u2032 } and partition Qn,m and Qn\u2032 ,m\u2032 as\n[\n[\nQn,m =\n\u03bbQnn\u2032 ,m\nand\nQn\u2032 ,m\u2032 =\n\u03bbQnn\u2032 ,m .\n\u03bb\u2208I1\n\n\u03bb\u2208I2\n\nHere I1 and I2 are defined als follows:\n\u2032\n\nI1 = {1, p2 , . . . , p(n \u22121)n },\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nI2 = {prn (1 + am\u2032 pm + . . . + am\u22121 pm\u22121 ) | 0 6 r < n; 0 6 ai 6 p \u2212 1}.\nIf there exists a semi-affine bijection between Qn,m and Qn\u2032 ,m\u2032 , this induces\na bijection\nG\nG\nQnn\u2032 ,m .\nQnn\u2032 ,m \u2192\ni\u2208I1\n\nn\u2032\n\ni\u2208I2\n\n\u2032\nnpm\u2212m ,\n\nthis contradicts Lemma 3.11 if\nBut since #I1 =\nand #I2 =\n\u2032\nn\u2032 6= npm\u2212m .\nIf the cardinalities of I1 and I2 are equal, let \u03c4 be a bijection between I1\nand I2 . Now put\n\u03c4 (\u03bb)\nf|\u03bbQnn\u2032 ,m (x) =\nx.\n\u03bb\n\u0003\nThe function f : Qn,m \u2192 Qn\u2032 ,m\u2032 is the required bijection.\nCorollary 3.13. Let n, n\u2032 > 0.\nThere exists a semi-affine bijection between Pn and Pn\u2032 if and only if\nn\nn\n#\u039bn\n= \u2032 p2ord ( n\u2032 ) ,\n#\u039bn\u2032\nn\nwhere \u039bn := Pn \u2229 {x \u2208 Q |0 < x 6 p2ord n+1 \u2212 1}.\nIn particular, if p \u2224 n and p \u2224 n\u2032 , there is no semi-affine bijection between Pn\nand Pn\u2032 if n 6= n\u2032 .\nS\nProof. Take partitions Pn = \u03bb\u2208\u039bn \u03bbQn,2ord n+1 , (and similarly for Pn\u2032 ), as\nexplained before. Assume that ord n > ord n\u2032 . By a similar reasoning as in\nthe proof of the previous corollary, a bijection between Pn and Pn\u2032 would\ninduce a bijection\nG\nG\nQnn\u2032 ,2ord n+1 ,\nQnn\u2032 ,2ord n+1 \u2192\ni\u2208In\n\ni\u2208In\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nwith #In = n\u2032 * #\u039bn and #In\u2032 = np2(ord n\u2212ord n ) * #\u039bn\u2032 . There exists a\nbijection if and only if #In = #In\u2032 .\nNow assume that ord n = ord n\u2032 = 0, and n > n\u2032 . There exists a bijecn\nn\u2032\ntion between Pn and Pn\u2032 if #\u039b\n= #\u039b\n. Under our assumptions, #\u039bn\nn\nn\u2032\n\u00d7\nis equal to the number of elements of Fp that are n-th powers. Applying\na result from elementary number theory, we get that #\u039bn = p\u22121\nd , where\nd = (p \u2212 1, n), and therefore Pn will be isomorphic with Pn\u2032 if and only\n\u2032\nif nd = n\u2032 d\u2032 . This is equivalent to nd\u0303 = n\u2032 d\u0303\u2032 , with d \u0303 = ad , d\u0303\u2032 = da , and\n\n\fCELL DECOMPOSITION FOR SEMI-AFFINE STRUCTURES ON p-ADIC FIELDS 21\n\na = (d, d\u2032 ). As a consequence, d\u0303\u2032 | n. If d\u0303\u2032 6= 1, there is q > 1 such that q|d\u0303\u2032 .\nBut then also q | (p \u2212 1, n). This contradicts (d\u0303\u2032 , d) = 1, so we conclude\nthat d\u0303\u2032 = 1, and therefore nd\u0303 = n\u2032 , which contradicts our assumption that\nn > n\u2032 , unless d \u0303 = 1 and n = n\u2032 .\n\u0003\nAcknowledgements.
