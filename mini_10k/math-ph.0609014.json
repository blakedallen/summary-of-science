We derive bounds on the integrated density of states for a class of Schr\u00f6dinger\noperators with a random potential. The potential depends on a sequence of random variables,\nnot necessarily in a linear way. An example of such a random Schr\u00f6dinger operator is the\nbreather model, as introduced by Combes, Hislop and Mourre. For these models we show\nthat the integrated density of states near the bottom of the spectrum behaves according to\nthe so called Lifshitz asymptotics. This result can be used to prove Anderson localization in\ncertain energy/disorder regimes.\n\n1. Introduction, model and result\nIn this paper we study spectral properties of certain Schr\u00f6dinger operators with random\npotential. The spectral theory of such operators has been studied since the eighties in the\nmathematical literature and there are several monographs devoted to this topic, see e.g. [7,\n3, 24, 29]. Certain spectral features, like the non-randomness of the spectral components and\nthe integrated density of states, are shared by a wide variety of models under mild ergodicity\nand regularity assumptions. However specific characteristics - like the existence of a certain\nspectral type - depend on the concrete model at hand.\nOur aim is to establish for a class of random Schr\u00f6dinger operators the Lifshitz asymptotics\nof the integrated density of states (in the sequel abbreviated by IDS). Spectral edges at which\nthe IDS exhibits Lifshitz tails are called fluctuation boundaries (of the spectrum). Based\non physical intuition one expects that ergodic random Hamilton operators exhibit spectral\nlocalization in a neighbourhood of a fluctuation boundary. Here spectral localization means\nthat in the relevant energy interval the spectrum is pure point, and the continuous spectral\ncomponent is absent, almost surely. Rigorous proofs of localization oftentimes rely on the\nestimates on the finite volume approximation of the IDS implied by the Lifshitz asymptotics.\nWe define now the class of operators considered in this paper and thereafter present our\nresults. They concern random Schr\u00f6dinger operators H\u03c9 of the following type\n(1)\n\nH\u03c9 = H0 + Vper + V\u03c9\n\nwhere H0 = \u2212\u2206 denotes the Laplacian on L2 (Rd ), Vper is a (Zd -)periodic potential and V\u03c9 is\na random potential of the form\nDate: 2010-08-12-breather.tex.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 35J10; 82B44.\nKey words and phrases. random Schr\u00f6dinger operators, integrated density of states, Lifshitz tails, breather\nmodel, non-linear randomness.\nc 2008 by the author.

The distribution of \u03bb0 is denoted by \u03bc and we assume inf supp \u03bc = \u03bb\u2212 . The function u is called single site potential.\nThroughout this paper we will make the following\nAssumptions:\nPeriodic Potential: The potential Vper is Zd -periodic and locally in Lp (Rd ) for some p > d.\nRandom Potential: The single site potential u : R \u00d7 Rd \u2192 R is jointly measurable and satisfies\nthe following:\n(i) For all \u03bb \u2208 [\u03bb\u2212 , \u03bb+ ] we have\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1 1 d\nsupp u(\u03bb, *) \u2282 \u039b1 := \u2212 ,\n2 2\n(ii) We have for all \u03bb \u2208 [\u03bb\u2212 , \u03bb+ ]\n\u2202\nu(\u03bb, *) \u2208 L\u221e (\u039b1 )\n\u2202\u03bb\n\nwith\n\nsup\n\n\u03ba1 := sup\nx\u2208Rd\n\n\u03bb\u2208[\u03bb\u2212 ,\u03bb+ ]\n\n\u2202\nu(\u03bb, x) < \u221e\n\u2202\u03bb\n\n(iii) For all x \u2208 Rd and \u03bb \u2208 [\u03bb\u2212 , \u03bb+ ] we have\n\n\u2202u\n(\u03bb, x) \u2265 0\n\u2202\u03bb\n(iv) There exist \u01eb1 , \u01eb2 > 0 such that for all \u03bb \u2208 [\u03bb\u2212 , \u03bb\u2212 + \u01eb2 ] we have\nZ\nd\ndx u(\u03bb, x) \u2208 [\u01eb1 , 1/\u01eb1 ]\nd\u03bb Rd\n(v) There exist \u03b1, \u03ba > 0 such that for all \u01eb \u2264 \u01eb2\n\n\u03bc ([\u03bb\u2212 , \u03bb\u2212 + \u01eb)) \u2265 \u03b1 \u01eb\u03ba\n\nNote that due to the positivity assumption (ii) we have actually\n\u2202\nu(\u03bb, x)\nx\u2208Rd \u03bb\u2208[\u03bb\u2212 ,\u03bb+ ] \u2202\u03bb\n\n\u03ba1 = sup\n\nsup\n\nA single site potential which stisfies conditions (i) - (iv) will be called monotone in the\nrandomness. Note that the randomness enters the potential (2) via a field of random variables\n\u03bbk , k \u2208 Zd , not necessarily in a linear way. A random potential of the form (2) with a single\nsite potential satisfying the above Assumptions gives rise to a metrically transitive or ergodic\noperator, see e.g. [12] or [24] for the definition. This implies that there is a subset \u03a3 of the\nreal line such that the spectrum of H\u03c9 coincides with \u03a3 almost surely, and that there is a\nwell defined IDS for the family H\u03c9 , \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9, see below for details.\nCondition (iii) ensures that for all \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9, x \u2208 Rd , k \u2208 Zd we have\n(3)\n\nu(\u03bbk (\u03c9), x) \u2265 u(\u03bb\u2212 , x)\n\n\fLIFSHITZ TAILS FOR THE BREATHER MODEL\n\n3\n\nThis enables us to write the potential part of the operator in a standardized way. If we set\nX\nV0 (x) :=\nu(\u03bb\u2212 , x \u2212 k) and \u0169(\u03bb, x) := u(\u03bb, x) \u2212 u(\u03bb\u2212 , x)\nk\u2208Zd\n\nthen V0 is Zd -periodic and \u0169 satisfies the same assumptions as the original single site potential\nu. Moreover \u0169(\u03bb, x) \u2265 0 and \u0169(\u03bb\u2212 , x) = 0. Thus we may subsume V0 into the potential Vper\nusing the relation Vper + V\u03c9 = (Vper + V0 ) + (V\u03c9 \u2212 V0 ). Consequently, we may and will assume\nfrom now on without loss of generality that\n(4)\n\nu(\u03bb, x) \u2265 0\n\nand u(\u03bb\u2212 , x) = 0 .\n\nIt is easy to see that in this case E0 := inf \u03c3(Hper ) equals inf \u03c3(H\u03c9 ) almost surely.\nExample 1. If we set in (2) u(\u03bb, x \u2212 k) = \u03bb f (x \u2212 k) we obtain an alloy type potential\nX\n(5)\nV\u03c9 (x) :=\n\u03bbk (\u03c9) f (x \u2212 k)\nk\u2208Zd\n\nSuch random potentials have been thoroughly studied before in the context of the Lifshitz\nasymptotics of the integrated density of states and localization, see e.g. [14, 22, 16, 23, 4, 20,\n13, 18, 28, 8, 29, 10, 11, 1]. If f is non-negative and sufficiently regular the resulting single\nsite potential u is monotone in the randomness. For such alloy type models the results we are\naiming at are by now well understood, therefore we will not elaborate on them further. \u0003\nExample 2. The main example which motivated this paper was introduced in [5]. For this\nmodel we set\nu(\u03bb, x) = \u2212f (\u03bb x)\nThe resulting stochastic field\n(6)\n\nV\u03c9 (x) :=\n\nX\n\nk\u2208Zd\n\n\u2212 f (\u03bbk (\u03c9)(x \u2212 k))\n\nis called random breather-type potential, cf. [5, 6]. If we assume for the function f that\n(7)\n(8)\n\nsupp f \u2282 \u039b\u03bb\u2212 ,\n\nf \u2208 C01 (Rd \\ {0})\n\nL\u221e (Rd ) \u220b g(x) := \u2212x * (\u2207f )(x) \u2265 0 and not identically vanishing\n\nthen the potential u : R \u00d7 Rd \u2192 R is monotone in the randomness. Inequality (8) is called\nthe repulsivity property of f .\n\u0003\nIn order to formulate our main result we introduce some more notation. For a selfadjoint\noperator A and a Borel set J \u2282 R we denote the associated spectral projection by \u03c7J (A).\nLet \u039bL (j) := [\u2212L/2, L/2]d + j \u2282 Rd be a cube of side length L centered at j \u2208 Zd . We write\n\u039bL for \u039bL (0) and denote by \u03c7\u039bL the characteristic function of this set. One possible way to\ndefine the IDS N : R \u2192 R is the following trace per unit volume formula\n\b\nN (E) := E Tr[\u03c7\u039b1 \u03c7]\u2212\u221e,E](H\u03c9 )]\n\nThe almost sure infimum E0 of the spectrum of the operator H\u03c9 coincides with the energy\ninf{E \u2208 R | N (E) > 0}. For more details about the IDS we refer to the surveys [15] or [30]\nand references given there.\n\n\f4\n\nW. KIRSCH AND I. VESELI\u0106\n\nThe follwing result on the asymptotics of the IDS at the bottom\n\u0001 of the spectrum tells us\n\u2212d/2\nthat it behaves roughly like N (E) \u223c exp \u2212 const. (E \u2212 E0 )\nfor E \u2212 E0 positive and\nsmall.\nTheorem 3 (Lifshitz Tails). Let H\u03c9 , \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 be a random operator with potential (2) satisfying\nthe above assumptions. Then\nlog | log N (E)|\nd\n(9)\nlim\n=\u2212\nE\u0581E0 log(E \u2212 E0 )\n2\nThis result can be used as a tool in a proof of spectral localization for breather-type\nmodels. In fact, the localization proof based on multiscale analysis usually requires two\nmain ingredients, the Wegner estimate and an initial scale estimate. A Wegner estimate\nfor breather-type models was given in [5] (see that paper for precise assumptions and [6]\nfor related results). Those authors also prove localization under certain assumptions on the\ndisorder and the energy. One can replace their initial scale estimate using Theorem 3 to\nobtain localization for small energies for breather-type models. We will not give details here.\nLet us note that recently there has been a number of papers devoted to Lifshitz tails for\nmodels which depend non-monotonously on the randomness, cf. [2, 9, 21]. To treat such\nmodels one needs to use different methods than ours.\nLet us make a comment on the difference between our proof of Lifshitz tails and the one\nfor the standard alloy type model. The basic strategy of proof is the same, but since we\nare dealing here with a non-linear dependece on the randomness, we introduce a new family\nof (non-linearly) mapped random variables, which correspond to local energy contributions.\nThen we are in the position to make use of Temple's inequality similarly as in the case of\nalloy type potentials. To be able to control the relation of the second moment (of the energy)\nto the first moment we need to linearize it. This linearisation is one of the instances where\nwe need the differentiability of the single site potentials with respect to the parameter \u03bb and\nsufficient control on the derivative.\nAs usual we prove Theorem 3 by giving an upper and a lower bound on N , respectively on\nthe limit in Eq. (9). The next Section 2 is of preparatory nature where we discuss boundary\nconditions and corresponding bounds on the integrated density of states. The subsequent\nSection 3 contains the proof of the upper bound on the IDS. The lower bound is given in the\nfinal Section 4.\n2. Boundary conditions\nIn this section we discuss boundary conditions for operators on cubes \u039bL . For the upper\nbound on the IDS we will use operators H0L,\u03c1 on L2 (\u039bL ) with appropriate 'mixed' boundary\nconditions, formulated in terms of a bounded function \u03c1 on the boundary \u2202\u039bL of \u039bL . We say\nthat a smooth function \u03c6 obeys the \u03c1\u2212boundary conditions if \u03c1 \u03c6 = \u2212n * \u2207\u03c6 on \u2202\u039bL . Here\nn * \u2207 denotes the outer normal derivative at \u2202\u039bL .\nIn a rigorous way we define H0L,\u03c1 as the operator associated to the sesquilinear form\nZ\nZ\n\u03c1(x) \u03c61 (x)\u03c62 (x) dx\n\u2207\u03c61 (x) \u2207\u03c62 (x) dx +\n(\u03c61 , \u03c62 ) 7\u2192\n\u039bL\n\nH1 (\u039bL )\n\n\u2202\u039bL\n\nwith the Sobolev space\nas its form domain. Here we use the same notation for a\nfunction \u03c6 on the cube \u039bL and its trace on \u2202\u039bL . Note that the second term of the sesquilinear\n\n\fLIFSHITZ TAILS FOR THE BREATHER MODEL\n\n5\n\nform is well defined since the trace of \u03c6 is in L2 (\u2202\u039bL ). The Neumann operator H0L,N is given\nby the choice \u03c1 \u2261 0, Dirichlet boundary conditions are formally given by \u03c1 \u2261 \u221e. The\nLaplacian with Dirichlet boundary conditions H0L,D is rigorously defined through the form\nZ\n\u2207\u03c61 (x) \u2207\u03c62 (x) dx\n(\u03c61 , \u03c62 ) 7\u2192\n\u039bL\n\non\n\nH01 (\u039bL ).\n\nWe will also need the operator H0L,P , the Hamiltonian with periodic boundary conditions\nat \u2202\u039bL . Likewise we need notation for restrictions of the Schr\u00f6dinger operators to finite\nL,\u03c1\ncubes with selfadjoint boundary conditions. We set Hper\n= H0L,\u03c1 + \u03c7\u039bL Vper , H\u03c9L,\u03c1 = H0L,\u03c1 +\n\u03c7\u039bL Vper + \u03c7\u039bL V\u03c9 and similarly for Neumann, Dirichlet and periodic boundary conditions.\nNext we discuss a special choice of mixed boundary conditions introduced by Mezincescu\nin [23]. For details see Mezincescu's paper or [19]. Denote by \u03c81 the L2 -normalized, positive\n1,P\nground state of Hper\nand by \u03a8 its periodic extension on the whole of Rd . Then \u03c8L :=\nL,P\n\u2212d/2\nL\n\u03c7\u039bL \u03a8 is the normalized ground state of Hper\n. Since \u03a8 is continuously differentiable\nand strictly positive (see e.g. [26]), we may define \u03c1\u03a8 (x) := \u2212 n*\u2207\u03a8(x)\n\u03a8(x) . We will use the notaton\nL,M\nL,\u03c1\u03a8\nHper\n= Hper\nand H\u03c9L,M = H\u03c9L,\u03c1\u03a8 and refer to the corresponding boundary conditions as\nMezincescu boundary conditions.\nWe denote the eigenvalues of the operator H\u03c9L,X for X \u2208 {D, N, M, P } by\n\nE1 (H\u03c9L,X ) \u2264 E2 (H\u03c9L,X ) \u2264 . . . \u2264 En (H\u03c9L,X ) \u2264 . . .\n\nwith the convention that we repeat eigenvalues according to their multiplicity. We also define\nN (E, H\u03c9L,X ) = #{n | En (H\u03c9L,X ) \u2264 E} .\n\nIt is well known that the IDS can be obtained as a macroscopic limit of normalized eigenvalue\ncounting functions\n1\nN (E) = lim d N (E, H\u03c9L,X )\nL\u2192\u221e L\nfor X \u2208 {D, N, M, P }. The equality holds for almost all \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 and all energies E where the\nfunction N is continuous. The following observation of Mezincescu (see [23] or [19]) will be\ncrucial for our analysis:\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1\n1\n(10)\nN (E) = sup d E N (E, H\u03c9L,D ) = inf d E N (E, H\u03c9L,M )\nL\u2208N L\nL\u2208N L\nEquation (10) is a so called bracketing result. It allows us to estimate the integrated density\nof states from above using Mezincescu boundary conditions and from below using Dirichlet\nboundary conditions. Another important feature of Mezincescu boundary conditions is the\nrelation\nL,M\nL,P\nE1 (Hper\n) = E1 (Hper\n) = inf \u03c3(Hper ) = inf \u03a3\n\nfor all L. These relations follow from the following facts: Note that \u03a8 is a positive disL,P\ntributional solution of Hper \u03a8 = E1 (Hper\n)\u03a8 on all of Rd . Thus the Allegretto-Piepenbrink\nL,P\nTheorem tells us that E1 (Hper ) \u2264 inf \u03c3(Hper ). On the other hand, by the Floquet-Bloch\nL,P\ndecomposition we know that E1 (Hper\n) is inside of \u03c3(Hper ), hence it is the infimum of this\nL,M\nset. Moreover, the function \u03c8L is a normalized L2 -eigenfunction of Hper\n. Again by positivity it follows that it must be the ground state of this operator. Finally, note that since the\n\n\f6\n\nW. KIRSCH AND I. VESELI\u0106\n\nrandom perturbation is monotone it follows that inf \u03c3(Hper ) \u2264 inf \u03a3. Standard arguments\nusing sequences of approximate eigenfunctions (e.g. as in the proof of equation (1.1) in [18])\nshow that inf \u03c3(Hper ) \u2208 \u03a3.\nL,M\nUsing the fact that \u03c8L is the normalized L2 -ground-state of Hper\nMezincescu generalizes\nin [23] the argument of [17] and deduces that there exists a constant \u01eb0 > 0 such that\n(11)\n\nL,M\nL,M\nE2 (Hper\n) \u2212 E1 (Hper\n) \u2265 \u01eb0 L\u22122\n\nfor all L \u2208 N.\n3. Proof of the upper bound\nIn this section we prove the upper bound on the IDS. For simplicity of notation we will\nassume in the sequel that E0 = inf \u03c3(Hper ) = inf \u03c3(H\u03c9 ) = 0. This can always be achieved\nby adding a constant to the periodic potential Vper . Our proof follows the strategy of [16],\nnamely we will make use of (10) and of the positivity of V\u03c9 to estimate for arbitrary L \u2208 N\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1\n1\nL,M\n) P E1 (H\u03c9L,M ) < E\n(12)\nN (E) \u2264 d E N (E, H\u03c9L,M ) \u2264 d N (E, Hper\nL\nL\nSince we are interested in the behavior of the IDS near the spectral bottom E0 = 0 it will\nL,M\n) is\nbe sufficient to consider only energies E \u2208 [0, 1].

To do so, we estimate E1 (H\u03c9 ) from below\nusing Temple's inequality. We will find that for E \u223c L\u22122 we have\n\u0001\nP E1 (H\u03c9L,M ) < E \u2264 exp(C Ld ) \u223c exp(C \u2032 E \u2212d/2 )\n\nwhich together with (12) gives the desired upper bound on N .\nNow, we give the details of our proof, which is split into five steps. We start by introducing\nnew random variables \u03bek which correspont to local energy contributions.\n\nStep 1 (Mapped random variables). On any compact set the function \u03a8 is strictly positive\nby the Harnack inequality and bounded by subsolution estimates, see e.g. [7]. Since \u03a8 is by\ndefinition periodic it is in fact uniformly bounded away from zero and from above,\n0 < c3 := inf \u03a8(x) \u2264 c4 := sup \u03a8(x) < \u221e\nx\u2208Rd\n\nx\u2208Rd\n\nWe abbreviate by d\u03b1(x) the measure \u03a8(x)2 dx on Rd .\nWe introduce for a parameter c2 \u2264 \u01eb20c\u01eb41 , i. e. c2\u01eb1c4 \u2264\n\n\u01eb0\n2,\n\nthe cut-off random variables\n\n\u03bb\u0303k := min{\u03bbk , \u03bb\u2212 + c2 L\u22122 } \u2208 [\u03bb\u2212 , \u03bb\u2212 + c2 L\u22122 ]\nand the non-linearly mapped random variables\nZ\n\u03bek (\u03c9) = \u03be(\u03bb\u0303k ) := d\u03b1(x)u(\u03bb\u0303k (\u03c9), x \u2212 k)\nEach \u03bek corresponds to a summand h\u03a8, u(\u03bb\u0303k , * \u2212 k)\u03a8i of the energy form depending on the\nrandom variable \u03bbk .\nWe derive two estimates which will be later P\nneeded for Temple's inequality. Set IL :=\n\u039bL \u2229 Zd and denote H\u0303\u03c9 := Hper + \u1e7c\u03c9 and \u1e7c\u03c9 := k\u2208Zd u(\u03bb\u0303k (\u03c9), x \u2212 k).\n\n\fLIFSHITZ TAILS FOR THE BREATHER MODEL\n\n7\n\nStep 2 (Analysis of the first moment).
