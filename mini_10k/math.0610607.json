Introductory concepts.\nOne supposes that m > 0 . This assumption will not affect the generalization,\nbecause Euler's indicator satisfies the equality:\n\u03c6(m) = \u03c6(\u2212m ) (see [1]), and that the congruencies verify the following\nproperty:\na \u2261 b(mod m) \u21d4 a \u2261 b ( mod ( \u2212 m ) ) (see [1] pp 12-13).\n\nIn the case of congruence modulo 0, there is the relation of equality. One denotes\n(a,b) the greatest common factor of the two integers a and b , and one chooses\n(a, b ) > 0 .\nB. Lemmas, theorem.\nLemma 1: Let be a an integer and m a natural number > 0 . There exist\nd0 , m0 from N such that a = a0 d0 , m = m0 d0 and (a0 , m0 ) = 1 .\nProof:\nIt is sufficient to choose d0 = (a, m ) . In accordance with the definition of\nthe greatest common factor (GCF), the quotients of a0 and m0 and of a and m by their\nGCF are relatively primes (see [3], pp. 25-26).\nLemma 2: With the notations of lemma 1, if d0 \u2260 1 and if:\nd0 = d01d1 , m0 = m1d1 , (d01 , m1 ) = 1 and d1 \u2260 1 , then d0 > d1 and m0 > m1 ,\nand if d0 = d1 , then after a limited number of steps i one has d0 > di +1 = (di , mi ) .\nProof:\n\n\u23a7a = a0 d0 ; (a0 , m0 ) = 1\n\u23aa\n(0) \u23a8\nm = m0 d 0 ; d 0 \u2260 1\n\u23aa\u23a9\n\n1\n\n\f\u23a7d0 = d01d1 ; (d01 , m1 ) = 1\n\u23aa\n(1) \u23a8\nm = m1d1 ; d1 \u2260 1\n\u23aa\u23a9 0\nFrom (0) and from (1) it results that a = a0 d0 = a0 d01d1 therefore d0 = d01d1 thus d0 > d1\nif d01 \u2260 1 .\n\nFrom m0 = m1d1 we deduct that m0 > m1 .\nIf d0 = d1 then m0 = m1d0 = k \u22c5 d0z ( z \u2208 N* and d0 | k ).\nTherefore m1 = k \u22c5 d0z \u22121 ; d2 = (d1 , m1 ) = (d0 , k \u22c5 d0z \u22121 ) . After\ndi +1 = (d0 , k) < d0 .\n\ni=z\n\nsteps,\n\nit\n\nresults\n\nLemma 3: For each integer a and for each natural number m > 0 one\ncan build the following sequence of relations:\n\n\u23a7a = a0 d0 ; (a0 , m0 ) = 1\n\u23aa\n(0) \u23a8\nm = m0 d 0 ; d 0 \u2260 1\n\u23aa\u23a9\n\u23a7d0 = d01d1 ; (d01 , m1 ) = 1\n\u23aa\n(1) \u23a8\nm = m1d1 ; d1 \u2260 1\n\u23aa\u23a9 0\n...........................................\n\u23a7ds \u2212 2 = ds1\u2212 2 ds \u22121 ; (ds1\u2212 2 , ms \u22121 ) = 1\n\u23aa\n(s \u2212 1) \u23a8\nm = ms \u22121ds \u22121 ; ds \u22121 \u2260 1\n\u23aa\u23a9 s \u2212 2\n\u23a7ds \u22121 = ds1\u22121ds ; (ds1\u22121 , ms ) = 1\n\u23aa\n(s) \u23a8\nm = ms d s ; d s \u2260 1\n\u23aa\u23a9 s \u22121\nProof:\nOne can build this sequence by applying lemma 1. The sequence is\nlimited, according to lemma 2, because after r1 steps, one has d 0 > d r and m0 > mr , and\n1\n\nafter\n\nr2\n\nsteps, one has d r > d r + r and\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\nmr > mr + r , etc., and the mi are natural\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\nnumbers. One arrives at ds = 1 because if ds \u2260 1 one will construct again a limited\nnumber of relations ( s + 1),..., ( s + r ) with ds + r < ds .\nTheorem: Let us have a, m \u2208 Z and m \u2260 0 . Then a \u03c6( ms )+ s \u2261 a s (mod m ) where s\nand ms are the same ones as in the lemmas above.\n\nProof:\n\n2\n\n\fSimilar with the method followed previously, one can suppose m > 0 without\nreducing the generality. From the sequence of relations from lemma 3, it results that:\n(0) (1)\n(2)\n(3) (s)\n1\n1 1\na = a0 d0 = a0 d0 d1 = a0 d0 d1 d2 = ... = a0 d01d11 ...ds1\u22121ds\nand\n(0)\n(1)\n(2)\n(3) (s)\nm = m0 d0 = m1d1 d0 = m2 d2 d1 d0 = ... = ms ds ds \u22121 ...d1 d0\nand\nms ds ds \u22121 ...d1 d0 = d0 d1 ...ds \u22121ds ms .\nFrom (0) it results that d0 = (a, m ) , and from (i ) that di = (di \u22121 , mi \u22121 ) , for\nall i from {1, 2,..., s}.\n\nd0 = d01d11d21 .......ds1\u22121ds\nd1 = d11d 21 .........d s1\u22121d s\n.........................\nd s \u22121 =\nd s1\u22121d s\nds =\n\nds\n\nTherefore\nd0 d1 d2 .......ds \u22121ds = (d01 )1 (d11 )2 (d21 )3 ...(ds1\u22121 )s (ds1 )s +1 = (d01 )1 (d11 )2 (d21 )3 ...(ds1\u22121 )s\nbecause ds = 1 .\nThus m = (d01 )1 (d11 )2 (d21 )3 ...(ds1\u22121 )s \u22c5 ms ;\ntherefore ms | m ;\n(s)\n(s)\n1\n(ds , ms ) = (1, ms ) and (d s \u22121 , ms ) = 1\n(s-1)\n1 = (ds1\u2212 2 , ms \u22121 ) = (ds1\u2212 2 , ms ds ) therefore (d s1\u2212 2 , ms ) = 1\n(s-2)\n1 = (d s1\u22123 , ms \u2212 2 ) = (d s1\u22123 , ms \u22121d s \u22121 ) = (d s1\u22123 , ms d s d s \u22121 ) therefore (d s1\u22123 , ms ) = 1\n...........\n(i+1)\n1 = (di1 , mi +1 ) = (di1 , mi +1di + 2 ) = (di1 , mi + 3di + 3di + 2 ) = ... =\n= (di1 , ms ds ds \u22121 ...di + 2 ) thus (di1 , ms ) = 1 , and this is for all i from\n{0,1,..., s \u2212 2}.\n...........\n(0)\n1 = (a0 , m0 ) = (a0 , d1 ...ds \u22121ds ms ) thus (a0 , ms ) = 1 .\nFrom the Euler's theorem results that:\n(di1 )\u03c6( ms ) \u2261 1(mod ms ) for all i from {0,1,..., s},\n\na0\u03c6( ms ) \u2261 1(mod ms )\n\n3\n\n\fbut a0 \u03c6( ms ) = a0 \u03c6( ms ) (d01 )\u03c6( ms ) (d11 )\u03c6( ms ) ...(ds1\u22121 )\u03c6( ms )\ntherefore a \u03c6( ms ) \u2261 1........1(mod\nms )\n123\ns +1 times\n\na\n\n\u2261 1(mod ms ) .\n\na (d ) (d ) (d21 )s \u2212 3 ...(ds1\u2212 2 )1 \u22c5 a \u03c6( ms ) \u2261 a0s (d01 )s \u22121 (d11 )s \u2212 2 ...(ds1\u2212 2 )1 \u22c5 1(mod ms ) .\nMultiplying by:\ns\n0\n\n1 s \u22121\n0\n\n\u03c6( ms )\n\n1 s\u22122\n1\n\n(d01 )1 (d11 )2 (d21 )3 ...(ds1\u2212 2 )s \u22121 (ds1\u22121 )s we obtain:\na0s (d 01 ) s (d11 ) s ...(d s1\u2212 2 ) s (d s1\u22121 ) s a \u03c6( ms ) \u2261\n\n\u2261 a0s (d 01 ) s (d11 ) s ...(d s1\u2212 2 ) s (d s1\u22121 ) s (mod(d 01 )1...(d s1\u22121 ) s ms )\nbut a0s (d01 )s (d11 )s ...(ds1\u22121 )s \u22c5 a \u03c6( ms ) = a \u03c6( ms )+ s and a0s (d01 )s (d11 )s ...(ds1\u22121 )s = a s\ntherefore a \u03c6( ms )+ s \u2261 a s (mod m) , for all a, m from Z (m \u2260 0) .\nObservations:\n(1) If (a, m ) = 1 then d = 1 . Thus s = 0 , and according to our theorem one has\na \u03c6( m0 )+0 \u2261 a 0 (mod m) therefore a \u03c6( m0 )+ 0 \u2261 1(mod m ) .\nBut m = m0 d0 = m0 \u22c5 1 = m0 . Thus:\na \u03c6( m ) \u2261 1(mod m ) , and one obtains Euler's theorem.\n(2) Let us have a and m two integers, m \u2260 0 and (a, m) = d0 \u2260 1 , and m = m0 d 0 .\n\nIf (d0 , m0 ) = 1 , then a \u03c6( m0 )+1 \u2261 a(mod m ) .\nWhich, in fact, it results from our theorem with s = 1 and m1 = m0 .\nThis relation has a similar form to Fermat's theorem:\na \u03c6( p )+1 \u2261 a(mod p ) .\nC. AN ALGORITHM TO SOLVE CONGRUENCIES\nOne will construct an algorithm and will show the logic diagram allowing\nto calculate s and ms of the theorem.\nGiven as input: two integers a and m , m \u2260 0 .\nIt results as output: s and ms such that\na \u03c6( ms )+ s \u2261 a s (mod m ) .\nMethod:\nA := a\n(1)\nM := m\ni := 0\n(2)\nCalculate d = ( A, M ) and M ' = M / d .\n(3)\nIf d = 1 take S = i and ms = M ' stop.\nIf d \u2260 1 take A := d , M = M '\ni := i + 1 , and go to (2).\n\n4\n\n\fRemark: the accuracy of the algorithm results from lemma 3 end from the\ntheorem.\nSee the flow chart on the following page.\nIn this flow chart, the SUBROUTINE LCD calculates D = ( A, M ) and\nchooses D > 0 .\nApplication: In the resolution of the exercises one uses the theorem and\nthe algorithm to calculate s and ms .\n\nExample: 6 25604 \u2261 ?(mod105765)\nOne cannot apply Fermat or Euler because (6,105765)=3 \u2260 1 . One thus\napplies the algorithm to calculate s and ms and then the previous theorem:\nd0 = (6,105765) = 3\nm0 = 105765 / 3 = 35255\ni = 0; 3 \u2260 1 thus i = 0 + 1 = 1 , d1 = (3, 35255) = 1 , m1 = 35255 / 1 = 35255 .\nTherefore 6 \u03c6( 35255 )+1 \u2261 61 (mod105765) thus 6 25604 \u2261 6 4 (mod105765) .\n\n5\n\n\fFlow chart:\n\nSTART\n\nREAD A1, M1\n\nA := A1\n\nM := M1\n\nI := 0\n\nSUBROUTINE\nLCD (A,M,D)\n\nYES\n\nNO\n\nS=I\n\nMS = M\n\nD=1\nWRITE S, MS\n\nI := I+1\nSTOP\n\nM := M/D\n\nA := D\n\n6\n\n\fBIBLIOGRAPHY:\n\n[1] Popovici, Constantin P. \u2013 \"Teoria numerelor\", University Course, Bucharest,\nEditura didactic\u0103 \u015fi pedagogic\u0103, 1973.\n[2] Popovici, Constantin P \u2013 \"Logica \u015fi teoria numerelor\", Editura didactic\u0103 \u015fi\npedagogic\u0103, Bucharest, 1970.\n[3] Creang\u0103 I, Cazacu C, Mihu\u0163 P, Opai\u0163 Gh., Reischer Corina \u2013 \"Introducere \u00een\nteoria numerelor\", Editura didactic\u0103 \u015fi pedagogic\u0103, Bucharest, 1965.\n[4] Rusu E, - \"Aritmetica \u015fi teoria numerelor\", Editura didactic\u0103 \u015fi pedagogic\u0103,\nEditia a 2-a, Bucharest, 1963.\n[Published in \"Bulet.
