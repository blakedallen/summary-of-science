The Coma cluster is the most heavily studied of all galaxy clusters (see Biviano (1998)\nfor an overview). Several lines of evidence, mostly based around the presence of substructure in the cluster, suggest that Coma has recently undergone mergers with smaller clusters.\nThe first evidence for substructure was based on the spatial positions of galaxies on the sky\n(Fitchett & Webster 1987; Mellier et al. 1988; Escalera et al. 1992; Merritt & Tremblay 1994);\nmore detailed evidence came from maps of the X-ray emitting gas in the cluster obtained\nby ROSAT (Briel et al. 1992; White et al. 1993; Vikhlinin et al. 1994). Further evidence for\na relatively recent merger history in Coma also comes from its anomalously low early-type\ndwarf-to-giant ratio (Secker & Harris 1996).\nA deeper understanding of a cluster's mass distribution and dynamical history can come\nfrom the line-of-sight velocities of the cluster members, obtained from redshift measurements.\nColless & Dunn (1996, CD96) made the first identification of statistically significant substructure in Coma's velocity distribution (an earlier study by Dressler & Shectman (1988)\ndid not find evidence of significant velocity substructure). CD96 were also able to develop a\nlikely merger history for the cluster, involving three subclusters centred around each of the\nmajor cD galaxies: NGC 4874, NGC 4889, and NGC 4839 (strictly, NBC 4889 is a D galaxy\nsince it lacks the extended halo characterising cD galaxies, but we will refer to all three\ncentral dominant galaxies as cDs for convenience). Biviano et al. (1996, B96) carried out a\nsimilar analysis, although their interpretation of the results was slightly different. Notably,\nthey argued that subclustering is only evident for the brighter (b < 17) galaxies, and that\nthe distribution of fainter dwarf galaxies is much smoother and comprises the \"main body\"\nof the cluster.\nThese studies of the kinematics of Coma have suffered from a lack of statistically large\nnumbers of dwarf galaxy redshifts in their samples. This is important, since the kinematics\nof the dwarfs may provide some important clues towards the dynamics and formation of\nthe cluster. For example, clusters acquire full dynamical relaxation in two stages. The\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nfirst is through violent relaxation, which leaves all galaxies with the same velocity dispersion\nregardless of mass. The second is through dynamical friction, which acts on longer timescales\nthan violent relaxation, and results in equipartition of energy. This leaves the massive giants\nwith a lower velocity dispersion than the dwarfs, so the evidence of equipartition can be\ndetected by directly comparing the dwarf and giant distributions. The kinematics of the\ndwarfs might also reveal something about their origins. For example, some subset of the\ndwarfs may be preferentially accreted at late times from the field (Donas et al. 1995; BravoAlfaro et al. 2000; Gallagher et al. 2001), so that rather than being in virial equilibrium they\nare falling into or through the cluster, either on their first approach (Caldwell et al. 1993,\nCD96) or having already passed once through the cluster core (Burns et al. 1994; Vollmer\net al. 2001). Alternatively, some of dwarfs may in fact belong to satellite populations bound\nto the cD galaxies in the clusters. In all these cases the kinematics of the dwarfs provide\na tell-tale signature. Recent studies that have searched for these signatures in the dwarf\npopulations of clusters other than Coma include Stein et al. (1997) on Centaurus, Drinkwater\net al. (2001) on Fornax, and Conselice et al. (2001) and Gallagher et al. (2001) on Virgo.\nWe have assembled a redshift sample that is more complete at faint magnitudes than\nany used previously. This was made possible by utilising the ability of the 2dF (2-degree\nField \u2013 see Lewis et al. 2001) and WYFFOS (Bridges 1998) multi-fibre spectrographs to\nmeasure many spectra at once over a wide field of view. This sample is described in section\n2. In section 3 we describe how we used this sample to compare the velocity and spatial\ndistributions of giant and dwarf galaxies. We find that the line-of-sight velocity distribution\nfor the giants is non-Gaussian with >99% significance, while the dwarf distribution is close to\nbeing a Gaussian. However, a battery of statistical tests failed to detect any other significant\nevidence for differences between the distributions of giants and dwarfs. In section 4, we\nshow that the lack of detectable differences in the localised velocity distribution rules out\nthe possibility of the entire cluster having proceeded significantly towards equipartition,\nwhich is consistent with the estimated timescales for dynamic friction to act in the cluster\nas a whole. However, we find that the number of available redshifts for dwarf galaxies in\nComa is still not enough to distinguish more subtle differences between the giant and dwarf\ndistributions that may have developed in the past due to mergers with smaller clusters.\n\n2.\n\nData\n\nThe positions, b magnitudes, and b\u2212r colours of the galaxies in our sample were taken\nfrom the GMP catalogue (Godwin et al. 1983). Our redshifts, 1174 in total, comprise the set\nused by CD96 (a mixture of values taken from the literature and values measured with the\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nHydra spectrograph) plus 272 more recently measured redshifts from the 2dF spectrograph\nat the Anglo Australian Telescope. A further 123 redshifts were taken from the sample\nmeasured using the WYFFOS spectrograph on the William Herschel Telescope (Komiyama\net al. 2001; Mobasher et al. 2001; Poggianti et al. 2001). 76 of the galaxies observed with\nWYFFOS were also observed with 2dF, and the corresponding redshifts were averaged; the\nother 47 were not covered by the 2dF data. Due to these extra redshifts from 2dF and\nWYFFOS our sample is more complete at faint magnitudes than the sample used by CD96.\nBecause of the low resolution of available images of the dwarf galaxies in Coma, it was\nnot possible to identify them morphologically. Instead, we distinguish dwarfs from giants\nusing a magnitude cutoff. The choice of a cutoff is arbitrary, as there is no obvious break\nin the properties of the galaxies in our sample as a function of magnitude. We chose an\nabsolute dividing magnitude of \u221217, which is consistent with values used in earlier papers\n- e.g. Poggianti et al. (2001). At the distance of the Coma cluster, this corresponds to an\napparent magnitude of b = 18 (assuming H0 \u223c 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ). In order to determine\nthe completeness of the giant and dwarf samples, we compare the number of galaxies in\nthe redshift samples with the total number in the GMP catalogue (complete to b = 20),\nexcluding those that fall outside the red edge of the cluster colour-magnitude relation, which\nis described in section 3.3 and Fig. 5. Galaxies bluer than the bottom edge of the colourmagnitude band were left in the sample, since there is a reasonable chance that unusually\nblue galaxies may be cluster members that have only recently fallen into the cluster. As\nsuch, the completeness percentages quoted below are lower limits on the true completeness.\nThe redshift data for the 'giant' sample (b < 18) is 80% complete over the whole cluster, and\n100% complete within 20\u2032 of the the cluster centre (which is approximately at the position of\nNGC 4874). The set of redshifts for galaxies with b > 18 is only 34% complete over the whole\ncluster but 55% complete in the central 20\u2032. To check for any spatial bias in these dwarf\nredshifts, we first noted that the limited sample 18 < b < 19 is about 60% complete over the\nwhole cluster and 85% complete in the central region. Thus any bias present for this limited\nsample would be small, especially in the central region. We then compared this limited\nsample with the spatial distribution of galaxies fainter than b = 19. We found that redshift\nmeasurements for the b > 19 galaxies were restricted mainly to the central regions near the\ncD galaxies. This is an artifact of low completeness away from the centre of the cluster \u2013 the\nb > 19 subsample is 39% complete in the central 20\u2032 but only 22% complete over the central\n50\u2032 . Thus there is some bias towards the cluster centre in the dwarf sample. However, all\nof the statistical tests discussed in this paper were duplicated using the upper-magnitudelimited 18 < b < 19 dwarf sample, and none of the results differed significantly from those\nobtained using the b > 18 sample (with no upper magnitude limit). We concluded that the\nspatial bias in the dwarf redshift sample does not significantly affect our results. For the rest\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nof the paper, the term 'dwarf sample' is assumed to refer to galaxies with b > 18, with no\nenforced upper magnitude limit.\nGalaxies with redshifts in the range (4000 < cz < 10000) km s\u22121 were taken to be members of the cluster \u2013 others were assumed to be field galaxies and were excluded. Over the\nwhole cluster, the resulting giant sample contains 452 galaxies and the dwarf sample contains\n293 galaxies. In the following we focus mostly on the region within 20\u2032 of the cluster centre,\nas this was where our redshift sample was most complete. It should be pointed out that\nthe most significant substructure found by CD96 was about 40\u2032 from the cluster centre \u2013\nthe subcluster surrounding NGC 4839, which appears to be in the process of colliding with\nthe rest of the cluster. We devote some attention to this region in the section on spatial\nsubstructure below.\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nResults\n\nLine-of-sight velocity distributions\n\nCD96 found that the line-of-sight velocity distribution for galaxies in Coma was nonGaussian with a >99% probability. However, their sample contained few dwarfs \u2013 it was\nroughly the same set of galaxies as our sample of giants. To investigate whether this nonGaussianity is also apparent for the dwarfs, we plot histograms of the velocity distributions\nof the giants and the dwarfs separately in Fig. 1. At a glance the giant distribution seems\nto be non-Gaussian, and a Lilliefors test (a Kolmogorov-Smirnov [K-S] test which takes into\naccount the fact that the mean and standard deviation are estimated from the data) confirms\nthis impression, rejecting a Gaussian fit with >99% probability. The dwarf distribution, on\nthe other hand, is only rejected as a Gaussian with less than 75% confidence. Thus, there is\nstrong evidence from the velocities alone for substructure in the giant distribution, but not\nfor the dwarfs.\nDespite this hint that the giant and dwarf distributions are different, a direct comparison\nbetween the two using a two-sample K-S test gives only a 45% chance that this is actually the\ncase. It may be that there simply are not enough dwarf redshifts to be able to tell whether\nthe dwarf velocities are drawn from the same distribution as the giants or whether they really\ndo in fact follow a Gaussian. To check this, a sample of 293 giants (as many as the number\nof dwarfs) was selected at random from the giant distribution and tested for Gaussianity.\nThis was repeated 1000 times. We found that 3% of the random samples generated in this\nway had a <75% chance of being non-Gaussian. Thus there is a small but not negligible\npossibility that the dwarfs could be drawn from the same distribution as the giants, and\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nstill not show any detectable signs of non-Gaussianity. We had to increase the number of\nsampled giants to about 330 for there to be a less than 1% chance of a sample having a\n<75% of being non-Gaussian. Thus we would have to increase the number of dwarf redshifts\nin our sample before we can tell with any certainty if the line-of-sight velocity distributions\nreally are different.\nGiven the arbitrary nature of our choice for a dividing magnitude between giants and\ndwarfs, it is worth investigating whether changing the dividing magnitude affects these results. If b = 17 is used instead of b = 18, the number of giants and dwarfs becomes 306 and\n439 respectively \u2013 note that there are now more dwarfs than giants. Despite this, the results\nof the Lilliefors tests and the two-sample K-S test are exactly the same as before \u2013 the giants\nare significantly non-Gaussian but not the dwarfs, while a direct comparison finds only a\n45% chance that the two distributions differ. We take this as an indication that our results\nare not sensitive to small changes in the choice of dividing magnitude. This also increases\nour confidence that the non-Gaussianity in the line-of-sight velocity distribution really is\nrestricted to the giants, since in this case we can't put the difference down to having less\ndwarf redshifts than giant redshifts. Finally, since B96 used a cutoff of b = 17 rather than\n18 to divide the giants and dwarfs, this result tells us that we can meaningfully compare our\nresults to theirs.\nThe velocity dispersion for the giants is \u03c3Gi = (979 \u00b1 30) km s\u22121 , and for the dwarfs \u03c3Dw\n= (1096 \u00b1 45) km s\u22121 . The dwarf dispersion is larger than that of the giants at the 2.2\u03c3 level.\nThis is qualitatively consistent with the effects of equipartition, which involves the transfer of\nkinetic energy from massive galaxies to lighter ones. However, complete equipartition would\ngenerate a far bigger difference between the giant and dwarf dispersions. To demonstrate\nthis, we performed a Monte-Carlo simulation in which each galaxy\nwas assigned a velocity\n\u221a\ndrawn from a Gaussian with a dispersion proportional to 1/ M (where M is the mass of\nthe galaxy in question), as expected for a cluster in equipartition. The mass of each galaxy\nis assumed to be proportional to its luminosity, and the mass-to-light ratio is assumed to be\nthe same for all galaxies. After assigning each galaxy a velocity, all of the velocities were\nscaled so that the dispersion of the total sample (giants plus dwarfs) was the same as that for\nthe real data, about 1000 km s\u22121 . The resulting dispersions for the giants and for the dwarfs\n(averaged over five simulations) were \u03c3Gi = (482 \u00b1 16) km s\u22121 and \u03c3Dw = (1523 \u00b1 60), a\nmuch larger difference than is seen in the real data. We can conclude from this that the\ncluster as a whole can only have marginally begun to proceed towards equipartition.\nThere is some evidence that many dwarf ellipticals in clusters arise from the infall of\nlate-type galaxies (Gallagher et al. 2001). The infall scenario predicts that the dwarf velocity\ndistribution should be broader than that of the giants. This is because an infalling population\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nis not virialised; the kinetic energy is roughly equal to the potential energy, rather than half\n\u221a\nthe potential energy, so the velocities of infalling galaxies should be on average a factor of 2\nlarger than those of a virialised population. As noted above, the dwarf line-of-sight velocity\ndistribution is indeed slightly broader than the giant distribution. However, as well as\nbeing wider, we would expect the distribution of an infalling population to be non-Gaussian\n(because it is not dynamically relaxed), and we see no evidence of that here. The fact that the\ndwarf distribution is close to Gaussian suggests that even if the dwarfs did form from infall\nin the past, they have since undergone some form of dynamical relaxation which has erased\nthe kinematic signature of the infall. An alternative explanation is possible if infall occurs\nin bursts, rather than continuously: a superposition of many 'infall burst' distributions of\nvarious dispersions and mean velocities could conceivably (although not necessarily) look\nGaussian.\nTo investigate the cause of the non-Gaussianity of the giants' velocity distribution,\nthe cumulative frequency of giants as a function of cz was plotted along with a cumulative\nGaussian with the same mean and dispersion (Fig. 2). We can see that the largest deviation\nfrom a Gaussian distribution occurs at cz \u223c 6500 km s\u22121 . This corresponds to the position\nof the largest gap in the velocity histogram for the giants (Fig. 1). The gap is not evident in\nthe dwarf distribution. Remarkably, the central velocity of this gap is close to the velocity\nof NGC 4889 (cz = 6508 km s\u22121 ). Also, a smaller gap around cz = 7400 km s\u22121 seems to\ncorrespond to the velocity of NGC 4839. This begs the question of whether or not these gaps\nare directly caused by the cD galaxies, via mergers or other less obvious dynamical effects.\nWe can gain some insight into this question by looking at the spatial positions of galaxies at\ndifferent redshifts, as described in the next section.\n\n3.2.\n\nLocalised Velocity Structure\n\nFig. 3 is a plot of the smoothed galaxy distribution as a function of projected distance\nD along the NE-SW axis in the sky and of the line-of-sight velocity cz, for the giants (a)\n\u221a\nand for the dwarfs (b). D is defined in terms of \u2206RA and \u2206Dec by D = (\u2206RA+\u2206Dec)/ 2,\nwith NE being positive and D = 0 at the cluster centre. The NE-SW axis is a natural choice\nbecause it is the axis on which the three cD galaxies are the most separated, and it seems\nto correspond roughly to the direction along which the NGC 4839 subcluster is approaching\nthe main body of Coma (CD96). The smoothed density plot in Fig. 3 was generated\nby convolving the actual galaxy distribution with a 2D Gaussian kernel. The smoothing\nalgorithm was adaptive, meaning that the width of the Gaussian was varied depending on\nthe local density of galaxies. The base values for the dispersions of the Gaussian kernel\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nwere \u03c3D = 5\u2032 and \u221a\n\u03c3cz = 200 km s\u22121 , and these were scaled for each gridpoint by a factor\nproportional to 1/ den, where den is the density of galaxies at that gridpoint. Thus the\nkernel narrows in high-density regions and broadens in low-density regions.\nRecall that from the velocity distribution (Figs. 1 and 2) we expect to see gaps in the\ndensity of giant galaxies around cz \u223c 6500 and 7400 km s\u22121 . There are indeed bands of\nnoticeably reduced density at these redshifts, but they are not strongly localised. The only\nidentifiable holes are at D = \u00b1 20\u2032 . If the velocity gaps were really caused by the cD galaxies,\nwe would expect to see some correlation between the spatial positions of these galaxies and\nthe gaps, but this does not appear to be the case.\nWhen comparing these two plots by eye there seem to be obvious differences between\nthem, such as the peak in the density of giants at (D \u223c 0\u2032 , cz \u223c 8000 km s\u22121 ) which doesn't\noccur in the dwarf distribution. However, these differences may well just be statistical\nfluctuations. We used three different tests to calculate the significance of any differences\nbetween the giant and dwarf distributions: a 2D \u03c72 test, a 2D Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S)\ntest, and a Monte-Carlo resampling test. Details concerning the first two can be found in\nPress et al. (1992). The Monte-Carlo test works by running through all of the galaxies in\nthe sample and reassigning each to either the dwarf group or the giant group at random,\nwhere the probability of being a dwarf is just the ratio of the number of dwarfs to total\nnumber of galaxies in the real sample. A large number of these reassigned samples (\u223c 1000)\nare generated, and for each the binned statistic Diff is calculated. Diff is defined by\n\u00132\nX \u0012 Di\nDiff =\n\u2212P\n(1)\nD\n+\nG\ni\ni\ni\nwhere Di and Gi are the numbers of dwarfs and giants in bin i and P = Dtot /(Dtot + Gtot ) is\nthe probability that any given galaxy is a dwarf. We then compare the value of Diff for the\nreal sample with the range calculated for the Monte-Carlo reassigned samples to obtain an\nestimate of the likelihood that the dwarfs and giants are from different distributions. Note\nthat the Diff statistic is very similar to the \u03c72 statistic; the difference is that for Diff each\nterm in the sum is not weighted by the total number of galaxies in that bin, so the result is\nless sensitive to small differences in highly populated bins than would be the case for \u03c72 .\nEach test was applied firstly to all the galaxies with \u221250\u2032 < D < 50\u2032 and 5000 <\ncz < 9000 km s\u22121 (henceforth referred to as the large range), and then again to just the\ngalaxies with \u221220\u2032 < D < 20\u2032 and 6000 < cz < 8000 km s\u22121 (henceforth referred to as the\ncentral range). When calculating the \u03c72 and Monte-Carlo statistics, any bins with less than\n5 galaxies total (giants and dwarfs) were neglected. The number of bins was chosen to be\nthe maximum for which the number of neglected bins did not exceed 25% of the total. This\nturned out to be a 6\u00d76\u2013bin grid for the large range, and a 5\u00d75 grid for the central range.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nThe results for each test when applied to the D-vs-cz distribution, quoted as the probability\nthat the giant and dwarf distributions differ, are given in Table 1. In summary, these tests\ngive no better than a \u223c85% chance that the two distributions are different, which is not\nenough to make any strong claims that statistically significant differences exist.\nAnother way to investigate how velocity substructure correlates with spatial position is\nto plot the galaxy densities on the sky for restricted redshift ranges. We have done this for\nthree different (but slightly overlapping) ranges: 5400 < cz < 6600 km s\u22121 , 6400 < cz <\n7600 km s\u22121 and 7400 < cz < 8600 km s\u22121 . The motivation for choosing these three ranges\nis related to conflicting claims made by CD96 and B96 regarding which velocity structures\nare associated with which of the cD galaxies. Both papers agree that the peak in galaxy\ndensity around (D \u223c 0\u2032 , cz \u223c 7000 km s\u22121 ) is associated with NGC 4874. However, they\ndon't agree about which galaxies are associated with NGC 4889. CD96 identify the galaxies\naround (D \u223c 5\u2032 , cz \u223c 8000 km s\u22121 ) with NGC 4889, whereas B96 assume the relevant cluster\nto be that around (D \u223c 5\u2032 , cz \u223c 6000 km s\u22121 ).\nThe projected density plots for the three velocity ranges (referred to henceforth as A, B\nand C respectively) for both giants and dwarfs are shown in Fig. 4. The densities for these\nplots were smoothed using an adaptive Gaussian kernel with base dispersions \u03c3RA = \u03c3Dec = 3\u2032 .\nThe densities in each of the three giant plots are set to the same scale - that is, they are all\nnormalised to the maximum value in region B. The same is true independently for the three\ndwarf plots (in other words, they have the same shading scale as each other but different\nto the giant plots). \u2206RA and \u2206Dec are restricted to the range \u00b120\u2032 to focus attention\nto the area around NGC 4874 and NGC 4889. In velocity range A, centred around cz =\n6000 km s\u22121 , both the giants and the dwarfs exhibit density maxima located roughly at\nthe positions of NGC 4874 and 4889, although offset by up to 10\u2032 . In velocity range B, the\ndensity maxima near NGC 4889 have vanished, but a peak near NGC 4874 is obvious for\nboth giants and dwarfs (although the peak in dwarf density is slightly less well defined than\nfor the giants). Finally, in velocity range C we still see for the giants a peak halfway between\nNGC 4874 and NGC 4889, whereas for the dwarfs there is no major peak near either of the\ntwo supergiant galaxies. Based on these figures, it is hard to make a clear identification of\nany one clump in velocity space with NGC 4889. The lack of dwarfs near NGC 4889 in\nregion C seems to point to the galaxies with velocities around cz \u223c 6000 km s\u22121 (region A)\nbeing associated with NGC 4889, consistent with the assumption made by B96, but this is\nby no means conclusive.\nB96 also argue that significant subclustering is only evident for the brighter (giant)\ngalaxies, and not the fainter (dwarf) galaxies. To test this, we used the \u03c72 , K-S and MonteCarlo tests to check for statistically significant differences between the spatial distributions\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nof giants and dwarfs in each of the velocity ranges plotted in Fig. 4. For the \u03c72 and MonteCarlo tests, we used a 4\u00d74 grid of bins, and we neglected any bins containing less than\n3 galaxies in total. The results (quoted as the percentage chance of the two distributions\nbeing different) are given in Table 2. These results clearly show no evidence of significant\ndifferences between the spatial distribution of giants and dwarfs in any of the three redshift\nranges. In fact, the distributions of giants and dwarfs seem to be unusually similar, compared\nto what we would expect if each galaxy was assigned to be a giant or a dwarf at random,\nespecially in range B. Based on these results, then, there is no evidence that subclustering is\nrestricted to just the giant galaxies. This is not to say that such a difference does not exist\n\u2013 merely that, if it does, our statistical tests cannot detect it with the number of redshifts\navailable to us. The issue of what differences our tests are in principle capable of detecting\nis discussed further in section 4.\n\n3.3.\n\nSpatial Substructure\n\nThe final test we carried out was to compare the spatial distribution of giant and dwarf\ngalaxies, ignoring redshift entirely. The giant and dwarf samples were expanded to include\nall the galaxies in Coma without determined redshifts. Since redshift can't be used to\ndetermine whether these galaxies are part of the cluster or not, we used the colour-magnitude\nrelationship instead. If the b-r colour is plotted against magnitude b for galaxies in the\ncluster, the points generally fall on a distinct band, as can be seen in Fig. 5a. Galaxies\nthat did not have determined redshifts, and lay outside this band on the colour-magnitude\nplot (Fig. 5b), were assumed to be field galaxies and were not included in the sample. The\nresulting expanded giant sample has 529 galaxies, and the expanded dwarf sample has 1041\ngalaxies.\nThe smoothed density plots of the spatial distribution of the two expanded samples are\nshown in Fig. 6. The results look something like the picture of Coma put forward by B96:\nthe distribution of giants shows two distinct peaks around the two central supergiants, NGC\n4889 and NGC 4874, while the dwarf distribution has a peak between the two supergiants at a\nposition corresponding to a secondary peak in the ROSAT X-ray map. (There is also another\nlarge peak about 10\u2032 W and 5\u2032 S of NGC 4874, which doesn't appear to correspond to the\nposition of any major central dominant galaxy). Once again we applied the three statistical\ntests to the two distributions to find out whether these apparent differences are significant.\nThree ranges were tested: a large range (-50\u2032 < \u2206RA < 50\u2032 , -50\u2032 < \u2206Dec < 50\u2032 ), a smaller\ncentral range (-20\u2032 < \u2206RA < 20\u2032 , -20\u2032 < \u2206Dec < 20\u2032 ), and a range surrounding NGC 4839\nwhere CD96 found the most significant subclustering (-50\u2032 < \u2206RA < -10\u2032 , -50\u2032 < \u2206Dec < -\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n10\u2032 ). The two binned tests (the Monte-Carlo and the \u03c72 ) used a 7\u00d77 grid and a cutoff of\n10 galaxies per bin for the large region, a 5\u00d75 grid and a cutoff of 8 galaxies per bin for the\ncentral region, and a 4\u00d74 grid and cutoff of 5 galaxies per bin for the region around NGC\n4839. These values were chosen based on the size of each region and the density of galaxies\nthere. The results of the statistical tests (once again in terms of the percentage chance\nof difference) are given in Table 3. None of the significance levels produced by any of the\ntests is high enough to be held up as strong evidence for a statistically significant difference.\nIt could be argued that the grid size used in the binned tests was too large to pick up the\nfeatures described by B96 (namely the difference in position of the peaks in the giant density\nand the dwarf density). To check this, we have repeated the tests using twice as many bins\nin the central region and cutoff of 3 galaxies per bin, and the results are approximately the\nsame as before (no greater than a 90% chance of the two distributions being different). The\nsame is true if we restrict attention to an even smaller central region of (-5\u2032 < \u2206RA < 10\u2032 ,\n-5< \u2206Dec < 10\u2032 ) which just encloses the density peaks for both giants and dwarfs.\n\n4.\n\nDiscussion\n\nB96 concluded that the dwarf distribution was significantly more uniform than the giant\ndistribution. They offered as an explanation the possibility that the original subclusters that\nmake up Coma had time to proceed towards equipartition before they merged, spreading\nout the dwarfs in both position and velocity space. Our results for the line-of-sight velocity\ndistributions of the giants and dwarfs are consistent with the findings of B96, in that there is\nsignificant substructure (and thus non-Gaussianity) present in the giant distribution but not\nthe dwarf distribution. However, we find no evidence for differences between the localised\nvelocity distributions or the spatial distributions of the giants and dwarfs, which contradicts\nB96. The primary reason why our conclusions differ is that B96 made no direct statistical\ncomparisons between the giant and dwarf distributions. Although to the eye there do appear\nto be differences, our tests show that there is still a significant probability of the giants and\ndwarfs belonging to the same distribution. Nonetheless, it is worth investigating whether it\nis plausible that the original subclusters could have been in equipartition, as B96 proposed.\nThe main processes by which energy can be transferred from massive galaxies to lighter\nones in clusters are two-body relaxation and dynamical friction. The typical timescale for\ntwo-body relaxation in a cluster the size of Coma is ttb & 3 \u00d7 1011 yr (Sarazin 1986), much\ngreater than a Hubble time, so we can expect that dynamical friction will be the dominant\nprocess driving the cluster towards equipartition. If we assume that the core of the cluster\nis an isothermal sphere, the timescale tf r for dynamical friction to significantly alter the\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nmomentum of a galaxy with mass M is given by (Binney & Tremaine 1987):\ntf r\n\n66 Gyrs\n=\nln \u039b\n\n\u0012\n\nri\n0.5 Mpc\n\n\u00132 \u0010\n\n\u0011 \u0012 1012 M \u0013\n\u03c3\n\u2299\n1000 km s\u22121\nM\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u039b is the ratio of the largest possible impact parameter to the smallest, ri is the initial\nradius of the galaxy's orbit, and \u03c3 is the velocity dispersion of the cluster. Typically ln \u039b \u223c 3\n(Sarazin 1986); for Coma, ri \u2243 0.5 Mpc, and \u03c3 \u2243 1000 km s\u22121 . When these values are\nsubstituted in to Eq. 2, we find that tf r \u2243 22 Gyr for a galaxy of 1012 M\u2299 (a typical mass\nfor a 'giant' galaxy). A galaxy would have to be more massive than 2.2 \u00d7 1013 M\u2299 to have a\ndynamic friction timescale less than 1 Gyr. According to Vikhlinin et al. (1994), the masses\nof the two largest galaxies in the cluster, NGC 4874 and NGC 4889, are both approximately\n1 \u00d7 1013 M\u2299 , so not even they should have had time to settle into the centre of the cluster\npotential. This is consistent with the observation that the galaxy velocities do not show the\nsignature of equipartition, and that the velocities of the main cD galaxies are displaced from\nthe mean velocity of the surrounding galaxies.\nIs it plausible that the subclusters conjectured to be merging with Coma would have\nhad time to approach equipartition? A rough criterion for judging this is to require tf r to be\nless than 1 Gyr for at least the most massive galaxies in a subcluster. The velocity dispersion\nof a cluster scales roughly as the square-root of its mass, so a subcluster with around 0.1\n\u221a\ntimes the mass of Coma should have a velocity dispersion of 0.1 \u00d7 the dispersion of Coma,\nor about 300 km s\u22121 . Then ri for such a subcluster only needs to be a factor of 3 smaller\nthan that of Coma to to bring tf r below 1 Gyr for a 1012 M\u2299 galaxy. These values of \u03c3 and\nri are well within the range that have actually been observed in small clusters (Adami et al.\n1998), so there is a good chance that any subclusters that have merged with Coma would\nhave been at least partially in equipartition.\nThe next question in this: if Coma is really composed of subclusters that are (or were)\nin equipartition, are our statistical tests capable of detecting it? We checked this by carrying out some Monte-Carlo simulations. The first set, described above in the section 3.1,\nreassigned velocities to each of the galaxies in a way consistent with the entire cluster being\nin equipartition. The positions of the galaxies were left unchanged. The resulting velocity\ndistributions showed a marked difference between giants and dwarfs, much larger than the\ndifference seen in the real data. We also tested the D-vs-cz distributions from the simulated\ndata, in exactly the same way as was done for the real data. The result (for the large range)\nwas always a >99.9% probability of the giant and dwarf distributions being different (the\nresults in the central range were a bit less consistent, with \u223c 1/2 of the simulations resulting\nin a >99% significance level). So we can be fairly confident that if the entire cluster was in\nequipartition we would be able to detect it. The fact that we don't is consistent with our\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nexpectation that Coma as a whole is too large to have approached equipartition.\nThe second set of simulations were done to mimic two equipartitioned sub-clusters\n(centred around NGC 4889 and NGC 4839 respectively) in the process of merging with\na 'main cluster body' centred on NGC 4874. This is approximately the merger scenario\nproposed by CD96. A certain fraction of the galaxies within 25\u2032 of NGC 4889 and NGC\n4839 were randomly assigned as being 'bound'; the fraction was chosen so that the number\nof galaxies bound to each of NGC 4889 and NGC 4839 comprised 10% of the total cluster\npopulation. The galaxies of these two bound populations were assigned velocities consistent\nwith equipartition, with a dispersion scaled to 300 km s\u22121 and a mean velocity equal to that\nof the relevant cD galaxy. We use 300 km s\u22121 for the dispersion of the bound groups because\nthese groups have about 10% of the mass of the entire cluster, and we expect the dispersion\n\u221a\nto scale as the square root of the mass; 0.1 \u2243 0.32, so the bound group dispersion should be\nroughly one-third that of the entire cluster. The remaining 80% of the cluster population was\nassumed not to be in equipartition (due to the combined effects of earlier mergers, violent\nrelaxation and infall); these galaxies were assigned velocities taken at random from a single\nGaussian with a dispersion of 1000 km s\u22121 and a mean equal to the velocity of NGC 4874.\nOne thousand of these 'merger' velocity distributions were simulated. For each, the\nline-of-sight velocity distributions for giants and dwarfs had very similar dispersions (\u223c\n1000 km s\u22121 ), just like in the real data. Direct comparisons between the giant and dwarf\nvelocity distributions using a K-S test failed to turn up a significant difference. Remarkably,\nthough, for 37% of the simulated distributions the velocities of the giants were non-Gaussian\nwith a >99% certainty. Conversely, only 1.4% of the dwarf distributions were significantly\nnon-Gaussian. The reason for this is that the effect of equipartition in the bound groups is\nto reduce the dispersion of giant velocities and spread out the dwarf velocities, so there tend\nto be distinct peaks in the giant line-of-sight velocity distribution around the velocities of\nNGC 4889 and NGC 4839 but not in the dwarf distribution. Thus it is plausible that this\nsort of merger scenario could account for the non-Gaussianity of the real giant distribution\nand the contrasting Gaussianity of the real dwarf distribution.\nThe D-vs-cz distributions of the simulated data were also compared, using the 2D K-S\ntwo-sample test. The giant and dwarf distributions were found to have on average an 85%\nchance of being different; only 2.3% of the simulated distributions were found to have a\n>99% chance of being different. Thus the statistical tests fail to detect the signature of\nequipartition in the subclusters with a high level of confidence, just as they did with the real\ndata.\nWe would expect that, in principle at least, increasing the number of redshifts in our\nsample would boost our chances of detecting evidence of differences between the giants and\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\ndwarfs. However, there are only so many galaxies there to be measured. We estimate\nthat roughly 670 of the dwarf galaxies listed in the GMP catalogue, which is complete to\nb = 20, are actually cluster members. The reasoning behind this is that about 52% of the\ngalaxies with measured redshifts (and bluer than the top edge of the cluster colour-magnitude\nrelation) are actually cluster members, so roughly the same percentage of the total number of\ndwarfs in the GMP catalogue (again, bluer than the top edge of the cluster colour-magnitude\nrelation) are likely to be cluster members. If we had redshifts for all 670 of these dwarfs,\nwould we then be able to detect significant differences between the giants and the dwarfs? To\nanswer this question, we ran a final set of merger-mimicking simulations, this time including\nall the giants and 670 dwarfs, drawn at random from the catalogue. The chances of detecting\ndifferences did improve slightly with the increased sample size, but still not enough to be\nstatistically significant. The 2D K-S two-sample test found on average that there was a\n87% chance that the giant and dwarf D-vs-cz distributions were different; only 5% of the\nsimulated distributions were found to have a >99% chance of being different. This suggests\nthat even if we measured redshifts for every dwarf in the cluster brighter than b = 20, we\nwould still not have a high chance of detecting evidence of equipartitioned subclusters in the\nD-vs-cz distributions.\nEven though this toy model of a merger scenario is contrived, it demonstrates that Coma\ncould indeed consist of equipartitioned subclusters. Indeed, the subcluster equipartitioning\nseems to generate the sort of non-Gaussianity in the giants (but not the dwarfs) that we\nsee in the real data. However, it doesn't generate differences between the giant and dwarf\ndistributions that are strong enough to detect with our direct statistical comparisons, even\nif we measured the redshifts of all dwarf cluster members down to b = 20.\n\n5.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe distribution of line-of-sight velocities for giant galaxies (those with b < 18) in the\nComa cluster shows strong evidence of non-Gaussianity, caused primarily by a large gap\nin velocities around cz = 6500 km s\u22121 . This gap, and others in the distribution, seem to\ncorrespond to the velocities of the cD galaxies NGC 4489 and NGC 4839, but it is still a\nmystery whether or not the cD galaxies are directly responsible for causing the gaps. Unlike\nthat for the giants, the distribution of velocities for a sample of dwarf galaxies (b > 18)\nexhibits no significant non-Gaussianity and no significant gaps. However, tests directly\ncomparing the localised velocity substructure and spatial substructure in the giant and dwarf\ndistributions show no strong evidence for significant differences between the two populations.\nOur results rule out the cluster as a whole having moved significantly towards equipartition.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nOn the other hand, they are consistent with the possibility that Coma formed from the\nmerger of subclusters that were in equipartition; indeed, our simulations suggest that such a\nscenario can explain the non-Gaussianity of the giant line-of-sight velocity distribution and\nthe contrasting Gaussianity of the dwarfs. We also find that such a merger scenario may\nnot generate a strong enough difference between the giant and dwarf distributions to be\nable to detect by direct statistical comparison, even if the redshifts of all cluster members\nbrighter than b = 20 were measured, so more sensitive tests must be developed to put stronger\nconstraints on Coma's merger history.\n\nREFERENCES\nAdami C., Mazure A., Biviano A., Katgert P., Rhee G., 1998, A&A, 331, 493\nBinney J., Tremaine S. 1987, \"Galactic Dynamics\", Princeton University Press, Princeton\nBiviano A., et al., 1996, A&A, 311, 95\nBiviano A. 1998, in \"Untangling Coma Berenices: A New Vision of an Old Cluster\", eds\nMazure A., Casoli F., Durret F., Gerbal D., World Scientific Publishing, p.1\nBravo-Alfaro H., Cayatte V., van Gorkom J.H., Balkowski C., 2000, AJ, 119, 580\nBridges T.J., 1998, \"Fiber Optics in Astronomy III\", eds Arribas S., Mediavilla E., Watson\nF., ASP Conf.

(a) is the distribution of\ngiants, and (b) is the distribution of dwarfs. In each case the density is smoothed using an\nadaptive 2D Gaussian kernel with base dispersions \u03c3D = 5\u2032 and \u03c3cz = 200 km s\u22121 . The\nsmall crosses mark the positions of the galaxies; the three large crosses represent the three\ndominant galaxies: from left to right, NGC 4889, NGC 4874 and NGC 4839.\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- Six slices in velocity through the \u2206RA-\u2206Dec-cz distribution: (a), (c) and (e)\nare the distribution of giants in the velocity ranges A, B and C respectively; (b), (d)\nand (f) are the same but for the dwarfs. The three ranges are A: (5400 < cz < 6600), B:\n(6400 < cz < 7600), and C: (7400 < cz < 8600), where cz is in km s\u22121 . Each density plot was\nsmoothed with an adaptive 2D Gaussian kernel with base dispersions \u03c3\u2206RA = \u03c3\u2206Dec = 3\u2032 .\nThe small crosses are the positions of the galaxies, and the two large crosses are NGC 4889\n(left) and NGC 4874 (right).\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\n\nFig. 5.- (a) b-r colour plotted against magnitude b for all galaxies within the redshift range\n(4000 < cz < 10000) km s\u22121 (and thus deemed to be members of the cluster). The solid lines\ndelineate the band within which most of the points fall. (b) The same plot for all galaxies,\nregardless of redshift. Any galaxies without measured redshifts, and that fall outside the\ncluster colour-magnitude relation determined from (a), are assumed to be field galaxies and\nare neglected.\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\n\nFig. 6.- Density plots of spatial position for giants (a) and dwarfs (b). The galaxy samples\nused here include all galaxies with 4000 < cz < 10000 km s\u22121 plus galaxies without redshifts\nbut within the cluster colour-magnitude relation (see Fig. 5). Smoothing is done with an\nadaptive 2D Gaussian kernel with base dispersions \u03c3\u2206RA = \u03c3\u2206Dec = 5\u2032 . As before, the small\ncrosses mark the positions of the galaxies and the large crosses mark NGC 4889, NGC 4874\nand NGC 4839 (from left to right).\n\n\f"}
