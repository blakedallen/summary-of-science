There are many extensions of the Standard Model (SM),\nwhich include a new, stable, weakly-interacting massive particle, possibly responsible for\nthe observed relic DM in the Universe. The LHC will provide first important data to\naddress the question whether one of these scenarios is indeed realised in nature. The ILC\nmeasurements of the properties of a DM candidate and of those other particles participating\nto its interactions in the early Universe may allow us to predict its relic density with an\naccuracy comparable to that currently achieved by CMB observations at satellites. With\nthese data in hand, the comparison of the results would have striking consequences for our\nunderstanding of dark matter.\n\n2\n\nNeutralino Dark Matter Density in MSSM and the ILC\n\nSupersymmetry emerges as the best motivated theory of new physics beyond the SM. It\nsolves a number of problems, intrinsic to the SM and, most important to our discussion, the\nconservation of R-parity introduces a new stable, weakly interacting particle. The WMAP\nCMB data, and other astrophysical data, already set rather stringent bounds on Supersymmetry parameters, if the neutralino is responsible for saturating the amount of DM\nobserved.\nThe potential of ILC data at 0.5 TeV and 1.0 TeV for determining the DM relic density,\n\u03a9\u03c7 , in Supersymmetry has been investigated in detail in [1]. This study selected a set of\nbenchmark points, the so-called LCC points, representative of various scenarios and determined the \u03a9\u03c7 probability density function by a scan of the full MSSM parameter space and\nretaining those points compatible with the measurements available at the LHC and ILC\nwithin their accuracy.\n\n3\n\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 H 0 A0 at LCC-4 with Full Simulation\n\nWe consider here a specific Supersymmetric scenarios, in which the DM candidate is the\nlightest neutralino, \u03c701 and its relic density is controlled by the rate of neutralino annihilation\nthrough the CP-even heavy Higgs pole \u03c7\u03c7 \u2192 A. The LCC-4 benchmark point [1] is defined\nin the cMSSM, corresponding to the parameters m0 =380.00 GeV, m1/2 =420 GeV, tan \u03b2=53,\nA=0, Sgn(\u03bc)=+1 and Mtop =178 GeV. We use Isasugra 7.69 [2] to compute the particle\nspectrum and we get MA0 =419.4 GeV, M\u03c701 =169.1 GeV and M\u03c4 \u03031 =195.5 GeV. The e+ e\u2212 \u2192\nLCWS/ILC 2007\n\n\f\u221a\nH 0 A0 \u2192 bb\u0304bb\u0304 process at s = 1 TeV ILC has already been studied for LCC4 [3]. That\nstudy, based on the parametric detector simulation program Simdet 4.0, showed that the\nA0 boson mass can be determined to \u00b10.8 GeV by imposing the natural width \u0393A or to\n\u00b12.0 GeV by a simultaneous fit to mass and width. These results, when combined with other\nmeasurements to be peformed at 0.5 TeV, allow us to predict the neutralino contributoion\nto the dark matter density in the Universe, \u03a9\u03c7 to a relative accuracy of 18 % in generic\nMSSM scenarios.\nHere, we repeat the same study on Geant-4-based simulation [4] of the detector response\nand reconstruct the physics objects using processors developed in the Marlin framework [5].\nThis study adopts the LDC detector concept, which employs a large continuous gaseous\ntracker Time Projection Chamber surrounded by a highly granular calorimeter and complemented by a high resolution Vertex Tracker, for which we have chosen the option based on\nCMOS monolithic pixel sensors. The LDC detector is discussed in details elsewhere[6], the\ndesign is optimised for achieving excellent parton energy measurements, through the particle\nflow algorithm, and precise extrapolation of particle tracks to their production point. Both\nthese features are important to the analysis, which aims to suppress backgrounds by exploiting its signature 4-b jet final state and requires good determinaton of energy and direction of\nhadronic jets to maximise the resolution on di-jet invariant masses. The jet energy resolution\nhas been studied using a simulated sample of single b jets in the energy range from 10\u221aGeV\nto 210 GeV over a polar angle, \u03b8, range 0.4 < \u03b8 < \u03c0/2, we get \u03b4E/E = (0.34 \u00b1 0.02)/ E \u2295\n(0.015 \u00b1 0.005), which is consistent with the particle flow performance specifications. Jet\nflavour tagging is based on three observables: the probability for all the particle tracks to\noriginate at the event primary vertex, the fraction of the jet energy carried by secondary\nparticles and the pt -corrected mass of the secondary particles. These are combined to form\na discriminant variable which peaks at one for b jets and peaks at zero for non-b jets.\nAt the chosen working point, an\nefficiency for b jets of 85 %\n120\n10\nHA (gen)\nHA (gen)\nis obtained with sufficient reHA (reco)\nHA (reco)\n100\njection of lighter quarks to ef10\nW W\nW W\nfectively suppress the remain80\nZZ\nZZ\ning non-b background.\nSignal\n10\nevents have been generated with\n60\nPythia 6.205+Isajet 7.69, in10\ncluding bremsstrahlung effects.\n40\nThese events have been passed\n1\nthrough the full LDC simula20\ntion using the Mokka 06-03 pro10\n0\ngram [7] based on Geant-4.

We assume to operate the ILC at 1 TeV for a total integrated\nluminosity of 2 ab\u22121 . Backgrounds can be significantly suppressed using event shape and\nkinematic variables. We require events to fulfill the following criteria: total recorded energy\nin the event ET OT > 850 GeV, total transverse energy ET >350 GeV, charged energy in the\nevent ECHA > 350 GeV, number or reconstructed particles NT OT >50, number of charged\nparticles NCHA >25, event thrust <.95 and Y34 <0.0025, where Y34 is the 3 to 4 jet crossover\nvalue of the jet clustering variable.

The algorithm adjusts the momenta of the jets given by\np~F = ea p~M +b~\npB +c~\npC where ~\npF is the fitted momentum, ~pM is the measured momentum,~\npB\nand p~C are unit vectors transverse to ~pM and to each other, and a, b and c are the free\nparameters in the fit. The adjusted momenta satisfy a set of constraints while minimizing\nthe fit \u03c72 , which is given by \u03a3i (ai \u2212a0 )2 /\u03c3a2 +b2i /\u03c3b2 +c2i /\u03c3c2 , where a0 is the expected energy\nloss parameter, \u03c3a is the energy spread parameter and \u03c3b ,\u03c3c are the transverse momentum\nspread parameters.\nIn this analysis we use the following constraints: px = py = 0 and\n\u221a\nE \u00b1 |pz | = s, where the last condition accounts for beamstrahlung along the beam axis,\nz. We report here preliminary results from the analysis of a sample of 1050 fully simulated\nsignal events. After applying final selection and mass constrained fit, the sample of events\nin the region 150 GeV< Mjj <550 GeV gives a selection efficiency of 23 % for signal bb\u0304b\u0304\nLCWS/ILC 2007\n\n\fdecays. The resulting mass distribution is shown in Figure 2. We describe the signal as\na CRYSTAL BALL (CB) function [9] and extract the A0 mass, MA , and width, \u0393A have\nbeen by a multi-parameter fit leaving the CB parameters free. We determine the A0 mass\nas (419.1\u00b10.9) GeV. This result is remarkably close to that obtained in the earlier analysis,\nbased on parametric detector simulation. The production and analysis of fully simulated\nand reconstructed background samples is currently under way.\n\n4\n\nFurther Constraints on \u03a9\u03c7\n\nBranching Ratio\n\nThe constraints on LCC4 derived from mass measurements at the LHC and ILC, provide a\nprediction of the DM density in the Universe to a relative accuracy of 18 % with a generic\nMSSM\nmodel.\nThis accuracy is still far from that\nachieved by CMB study with satel1\nA \u2192 bb\nlites. The main contribution to\n0.9\nA \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4\nthe remaining uncertainty is the\nH\u2192 bb\n0.8\nweak constrain which the data proH\u2192 \u03c4\u03c4\n0.7\nH\u2192 \u223c\u03c41\u223c\u03c41\nvide to MSSM solutions where\n0.6\n\u03a9\u03c7 is significantly lower than its\nreference for LCC4. A detailed\n0.5\nstudy shows that these solutions\n0.4\nare all characterised by large val0.3\nues of the stau trilinear coupling,\n0.2\nAtau .

At large values of\n|Atau |, the stau decay process through the H 0 \u2192 \u03c4\u03031 \u03c4\u03031 gets a sizeable branching fraction.\nThis channel contributes to the neutralino annihilation rate through \u03c7\u03030 \u03c7\u03030 \u2192 H 0 \u2192 \u03c4\u03031 \u03c4\u03031 ,\nbringing down the corresponding relic density, as observed in the MSSM scans. At the same\ntime, a determnation of the branching fraction of the decay H 0 \u2192 \u03c4\u03031 \u03c4\u03031 , allows to constrain\n|Atau |. Figure 3 shows the decay branching fractions of the A0 and H 0 bosons computed using the HDECAY 2.0 program [10] as a function of Atau . Now, a large H 0 \u2192 \u03c4\u03031 \u03c4\u03031 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c7\u03030 \u03c4 \u03c7\u03030\nyield can be detected by a standard bb\u0304\u03c4 \u03c4 analysis. A preliminary study shows that the A0 ,\nH 0 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 branching fraction can be determined to \u00b1 15 % and A0 , H 0 \u2192 bb\u0304 to \u00b1 7 %,\nfrom which a limit |Atau | < 250 GeV can be derived. This constrain removes the tail at\nlow values of \u03a9\u03c7 and results in a prediction of the neutralino relic density with a relative\naccuracy of 8 %. A detailed study on full simulation to support these preliminary results is\ncurrently under way.\nLCWS/ILC 2007\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to Abder Djouadi for pointing out the sensitivity of the H decay branching fractions to Atau and to Michael Peskin for discussion.
