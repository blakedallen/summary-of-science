J. Wasserburg\n\n1. Introduction\nThe high-resolution (e.g., [1 \u2013 5] and medium-resolution [6] observations of elemental abundances in a large number of low-metallicity stars in the Galactic halo (and a single star in a dwarf\ngalaxy [7]) now provide a data base for determining the stellar sources contributing to the interstellar/intergalactic medium (ISM/IGM) at metallicities of \u22125.5 < [Fe/H] < \u22121.5. These data taken\nin conjunction with stellar models appear to define the massive stars active in the early epochs.\nThis changes our views of what may be Population III (Pop III) stars and what stellar types are\ncontinuing contributors through the present epoch. A key to our understanding is the recognition\nthat low-mass and normal core-collapse supernovae (SNe) from progenitors of \u223c 8\u201311 M\u2299 and\n\u223c 12\u201325 M\u2299 , respectively, end their lives as neutron stars and that nucleosynthesis in the neutrinodriven winds of nascent neutron stars produce a large group of elements including Sr, Y, and Zr\nvia charged-particle reactions (CPR, e.g., [8]). This process is not the true \"r-process\" with rapid\nneutron capture. In considering the contributions of low-mass and normal SNe that are certainly\nkey contributors, certain rules are now established:\n1. The true \"r-process\" is not connected with any significant production of Fe group nuclei (or\nthe low-A elements below Zn with mass numbers A \u223c 23\u201370, e.g., [9]);\n2. The CPR nuclei are not directly coupled to the true \"r-process\" elements. While some\nworkers consider that a \"turn-on\" of high neutron densities may be achieved in some unknown way\ncoupled to a neutrino-driven wind, the observational data do not appear to be in support of this;\n3. If one assumes that only low-mass and normal SNe were the sources, then [Sr/Fe] must\nexceed \u22120.32 for all metal-poor stars.\nThe last rule appears to be well followed for [Fe/H] > \u22123, consistent with a two-component\nmodel of chemical evolution [10]. However, below [Fe/H] \u223c \u22123 there is a gross deficiency of Sr\n(and other CPR elements) relative to Fe. This is shown in Figure 1a. This observation requires that\nthere be an early stellar source of Fe that leaves behind a black hole instead of a neutron star with\nneutrino-driven winds producing the CPR nuclei. It further follows that a third stellar component\nin addition to low-mass and normal SNe is required to account for all the abundance data.\n\n2. The third source\nThe effects of all three stellar sources are most clearly seen if we consider the relationship of\nSr (a CPR element) in conjunction with Ba (a true \"r-process\" element at low metallicities) and\nFe. Using the yield ratios (Sr/Ba)H of the H source (low-mass SNe) and (Sr/Fe)L of the L source\n(normal SNe) we obtain:\n(Sr/H) = (Sr/Ba)H (Ba/H) + (Sr/Fe)L (Fe/H) fFe,L ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere fFe,L is the fraction of Fe from the L source. The above equation can be rewritten as:\n\u0011\n\u0010\n[Sr/Ba]H +[Ba/Fe]\n[Sr/Fe]L\n.\n(2.2)\n[Sr/Fe] = log 10\n+ fFe,L \u00d7 10\nThe evolution of [Sr/Fe] with [Ba/Fe] for the high-resolution data shown in Figure 1a is exhibited\nin Figure 1b along with the curves representing Equation (2.2) for fFe,L = 0, 0.1, 0.5, and 1.

The solid line is calculated from the twocomponent model for a well-mixed ISM/IGM. Note that there is a great deficiency of Sr for many sample\nstars with [Fe/H] . \u22123. It is evident that a source producing Fe and no Sr is required. (b) Evolution of\n[Sr/Fe] with [Ba/Fe] for the data shown in (a). The curves correspond to different fractions fFe,L of Fe due to\nthe L source (normal SNe). Details for these and the other figures of this contribution can be found in [11].\n\nWhile there appears to be a clustering of data in the neighborhood of fFe,L = 1 corresponding\nto Fe contributions exclusively from the L source in Figure 1b, there is a substantial fraction of the\ndata lying down to fFe,L = 0. This requires an Fe source not related to normal SNe and clearly\nshows that the preponderance of the Fe in many sample stars is from this third source. Essentially\nthe same results shown for [Sr/Fe] vs. [Ba/Fe] are found for [Y/Fe] vs. [La/Fe] and [Zr/Fe] vs.\n[Ba/Fe], where La and Ba are measures of the true \"r-process\" contributions. These results clearly\nshow that there are major contributions from the third source producing Fe with no CPR elements\nand no \"r-process\" nuclei.\nThe matter at hand is what is the nature of this third source? Consideration of the yields of\nvery massive stars (\u223c 140\u2013260 M\u2299 ) associated with pair-instability SNe (PI-SNe) show that these\nsources are characterized by strong deficiencies in the elements of odd atomic numbers (e.g., Na,\nAl, K, Sc, V, Mn, Co). Neither the data from earlier studies [12] nor the more precisely-determined\ndata from recent studies [13] on low-metallicity halo stars exhibit these deficiencies. It follows that\nPI-SNe cannot be the third source. A plausible candidate is hypernovae (HNe) from progenitors of\n\u223c 25\u201350 M\u2299 . These stars are known to be active in the current epoch, although little attention has\nbeen paid to them in consideration of Galactic chemical evolution. They have explosion energies\nfar above those of low-mass and normal SNe and are presumed to be associated with gamma-ray\nbursts. The yields of HNe are generally not well known, but the typical Fe yield inferred from\nobservations is \u223c 0.5 M\u2299 , much higher than the yield of \u223c 0.07 M\u2299 for normal SNe [14].\nIf we assume a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) for massive stars of \u223c 8\u201350 M\u2299 , the relative rates are RHN : RH : RL \u223c 0.36 : 0.96 : 1 for HNe, low-mass SNe (H), and normal SNe (L),\nrespectively. Of the Fe contributed by massive stars to the ISM/IGM, the fraction from HNe is\n\u223c 0.72. Thus HNe are the dominant Fe source at early epochs with contributions far exceeding\nthose of normal SNe. This seems to explain the earlier conundrum that the yield patterns for the\nlow-A elements below Zn in stars at very low metallicities ([Fe/H] < \u22123) appear to be indistinguishable from what was attributed to normal SNe at higher metallicities (see Figure 2) [9].\n3\n\n\fChemical Evolution of the Early Galaxy\n\nG.

(b)\nSame as (a) but for [Y/Fe] vs. [La/Fe].\n\nIt is now evident that the inventory of the low-A elements including Fe that we had attributed to\nnormal SNe is in fact the mixture of HN and normal SN ejecta where the preponderant contributions\nare from HNe. Thus the previously-designated L source is not a pure source but a blend of HNe\nand normal SNe: L = L\u2217 + HNe, where L\u2217 represents normal SNe. For the estimated yields and\nrelative rates given above, it follows that the \u223c 1/3 of the solar Fe inventory previously assigned\nto normal SNe is in considerable error. Taking \u223c 2/3 of the solar Fe inventory to be from Type Ia\nSNe, we find that of the remaining \u223c 1/3, \u223c 24% is from HNe with only \u223c 9% from normal SNe.\nThus with the proper assignment of Fe contributions for the L blend with [Sr/Fe]L = \u22120.32, we\nobtain [Sr/Fe]L\u2217 = 0.3 for the L\u2217 source. Using the proper yield ratios for the L\u2217 source, we obtain\nthe results shown in Figure 3. It is seen that the data for all the elements appear to be described\nvery well by the three-component (H, L\u2217 , and HNe) model. We further note that the clump of data\nabove the fFe,L = 1 curve in Figure 1b are now absent in Figure 3a with diminished Fe contribution\nfrom normal SNe.\n4\n\n\fChemical Evolution of the Early Galaxy\n\nG. J. Wasserburg\n\n3. General discussion\nFrom the results reviewed above it appears that the whole chemical evolution in the \"juvenile\nepoch\" of the first Gyr after the Big Bang may be explained by the concurrent contributions of\nmassive stars associated with low-mass and normal SNe and HNe in a standard IMF and that this\nsame relative contribution continues into the present epoch. The efforts to seek Pop III stars that\nonly occur in early epochs and then stop are considered by us to be invalid as were our earlier\nefforts to find a \"prompt inventory\" in the ISM/IGM. It follows that models for the formation of the\n\"first\" stars, which has been the focus of intensive studies with due consideration of the complex\ncondensation and cooling processes at zero to low metallicities (e.g., [15, 16]), should consider\nthe stellar populations inferred here with HNe (\u223c 25\u201350 M\u2299 ) being the dominant metal source.\nThis source is highly disruptive and certainly can disperse debris through the IGM until halos of\nsubstantial mass have formed. The apparent sudden onset of heavy \"r-process\" elements, which\nmotivated our earlier search for a \"prompt inventory\", is most plausibly related to the formation\nof halos of sufficient mass that remain bound following both SNe and HNe [17]. It also follows\nthat the earlier models of Galactic chemical evolution that aimed to provide \u223c 1/3 of the solar Fe\ninventory by normal SNe must now be subject to reinvestigation. The observational evidence for\nongoing HNe in the current epoch cannot be ignored. There is further the fact that production of\nheavy (true) r-process nuclei is strongly decoupled from Fe production. The extent to which this\npresents a further challenge to stellar models is to be resolved.\n\nReferences\n[1] J.A. Johnson and M. Bolte, ApJ 579 (2002) 616.\n[2] S.
