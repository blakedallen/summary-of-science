Today, the status of time as a quantum observable continues to remain controversial due to\na lack of a generalized approach in representing quantum\ntime observables. As proof, numerous quantum time observables corresponding to a given physical system have\nbeen constructed using different procedures; examples of\nsuch quantum time observables are provided in references\n[1\u201321].\nHowever, a generalized approach towards the representation of time as a quantum observable is detailed in\nreferences [22, 23]. In this approach, time is represented\nas an operator which satisfies the time-energy canonical commutation relation (TE-CCR) (TH \u2212 HT) |\u03c6 i =\n\u00b1i~ |\u03c6 i , where H is the Hamiltonian operator corresponding to the system in which the TE-CCR is formulated, and T is a time operator, or a solution to the\nTE-CCR. This approach implies that one can obtain a\nmultitude of quantum time observables for a physical system simply by solving the TE-CCR. Applications of this\napproach towards the construction of quantum time observables for a particular physical system are detailed in\nreferences [24\u201330]. The time observables constructed in\nthese references have attracted interest for both mathematical and physical reasons. In particular, the time\noperator constructed in reference [24] has been shown\nby Arai [31] to be a generalized time operator, as well\nas relevant to the perturbation expansion of the system\nHamiltonian.\nThis generalized approach towards constructing quantum time observables leads to a multitude of quantum\ntime observables for a given system, giving rise to a need\nfor a mechanism to distinguish between these quantum\ntime observables. Such a possible mechanism has been\ndetailed in reference [32], where it was shown that one\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: rcaballar@nip.upd.edu.ph\naddress: eric.galapon@up.edu.ph\n\ncan distinguish between multiple solutions to the TECCR using their corresponding canonical domains, which\nare subspaces of H within which the TE-CCR is valid, as\nwell as the system's internal unitary dynamics. Such a\nmechanism for physically distinguishing between multiple solutions to the TE-CCR is significant, since it shows\nthat there is a possible relationship between time and the\ninternal unitary dynamics of the system, allowing for a\nbetter understanding of the nature of time as a quantum\nobservable. However, there is the question of whether it\nis possible to distinguish between multiple solutions to\nthe TE-CCR of the same category, i. e. multiple solutions to the TE-CCR with identical canonical domains.\nThis question is significant, since a negative answer to\nthis question implies that, from a physical point of view,\nmultiple solutions to the TE-CCR of the same category\nare identical to each other, so one can use any of those\nsolutions to the TE-CCR to represent the quantum time\nobservable corresponding to those solutions.\nTo be able to answer this question, we construct solutions to the TE-CCR of closed and dense category respectively, and show that the resulting solutions to the\nTE-CCR may be distinguished from each other using particular internal symmetries involving time reversal. We\nthen use the methods first described in reference [32] in\norder to determine whether one will be able to distinguish between multiple solutions to the TE-CCR of the\nsame category via the system's internal unitary dynamics. The results of these investigations, which will be\npresented later in the paper, then imply that indeed, it\nis possible to distinguish between multiple solutions to\nthe TE-CCR of the same category using not just the system's internal unitary dynamics, but also using certain\ninternal symmetries which involve time reversal.\nThis paper represents our continuing efforts to understand the nature of time as a quantum observable. The\nrest of this paper is organized as follows. In section II,\nwe give an overview of previous work done concerning\nmultiple solutions to the TE-CCR of different categories.\nIn sections III and IV, we show how multiple solutions to\nthe TE-CCR of the same category can be mathematically\nand physically distinguishedfrom each other using particular internal symmetries involving time reversal and the\n\n\f2\nsystem's internal unitary dynamics. We summarize our\nfindings in section V.\n\nII.\n\nTHE TIME - ENERGY CANONICAL\nCOMMUTATION RELATION\n\nBased on discussions on the mathematical properties\nof canonical commutation relations in reference [23], the\nTE-CCR is valid only within a subspace DC of the\nHilbert space H, where DC is the canonical domain of\nthe TE-CCR, which may either be dense or non-dense.\nIf DC is dense, then the time operator corresponding to\nDC is said to be a solution to the TE-CCR of dense category. If, on the other hand, DC is non-dense, then its\nclosure is a proper subspace of H, so DC is said to be\nclosed, and the time operator corresponding to DC is\nsaid to be a solution to the TE-CCR of closed category.\nA particular system in which a TE-CCR can be formulated and which was first described in references\n[25, 27] is a structureless particle of mass \u03bc confined\nwithin a potential-free segment of the real line with\nendpoints at \u2212l and l, l > 0. The Hilbert space\nH = L2 [\u2212l, l] is attached to this system. The Hamiltonian for this system is defined as H\u03b3 = (2\u03bc)\u22121 p2\u03b3 , where\np\u03b3 = \u2212i~\u2202q is a self-adjoint momentum operator whose\ndomain is comprised of all elements\u03c6(q) of H whose\nderivatives are square integrable and which satisfy the\nboundary conditions \u03c6(\u2212l) = e\u22122i\u03b3 \u03c6(l). We note that\nthe eigenfunctions of H\u03b3 have the explicit form \u03c6\u03b3k (q) =\n\u0002\n\u0003\n(2l)\u22121/2 exp iql (\u03b3 + k\u03c0) and their corresponding eigen\u00012\nvalues have the form Ek,\u03b3 = (2\u03bc)\u22121 ~l\u22121 (\u03b3 + k\u03c0)2 .\nIn reference [23], it has been shown that multiple solutions to the TE-CCR formulated in the system described\nin the previous paragraph exist, with nothing to mathematically forbid their existence. Two such solutions to\nthis TE-CCR which were considered in reference [23] are\nthe characteristic time operator (CTO) T\u03b3,2 , which is of\ndense category and which was first presented in reference\n[24], and the confined quantum time of arrival operator\n(CTOA operator) T\u03b3,1 , which is of closed category and\nwhich was first presented in reference [25]. These solutions to the TE-CCR were also shown in reference [32]\nto be distinct from each other with respect to the system's internal unitary dynamics. As such, one can then\ndistinguish between multiple solutions to the TE-CCR\nof different categories by means of either their canonical\ndomain or the system's internal unitary dynamics.\nThe use of the internal unitary dynamics to differentiate between the CTOA operator and the CTO has its\norigins in the use of the internal unitary dynamics to\nprovide a physical interpretation for these time operators, a method which was first demonstrated in references\n[25, 27]. The standard way to interpret such operators\nwould be via the quantum measurement postulate, which\nstates that when a quantum observable is measured, the\nresults of such a measurement of the observable will be\none of the eigenvalues of the operator which represents\n\nthe quantum observable in Hilbert space. Furthermore,\nsuch a measurement may be taken at any instant of time.\nIn the case of a quantum time operator then, its eigenvalues will have units of time, and there can be countably\nmany results obtained in taking a quantum measurement\nof a quantum time observable. A problem then occurs\nwhen we consider that the quantum measurement can be\ntaken at any instant of time. The problem occurs because, as stated earlier, any one of the countably many\neigenvalues of the quantum time operator corresponding to the quantum time observable being measured can\nemerge as the result of measuring such an observable.\nSo it is possible then that at an instant of time equal\nto 15 seconds, the result of a quantum measurement of a\nquantum time observable will be one of the eigenvalues of\nthe operator representation of that quantum observable\nwhose magnitude is 3 seconds, in which case the quantum measurement postulate is inadequate in resolving\nthis apparent paradox. Thus there is a need to devise\na mechanism to physically interpret these time operators without having to resort to the use of the quantum\nmeasurement postulate, a mechanism provided by the\nsystem's internal unitary dynamics.\nHowever, there now arises the question of how one can\ndistinguish between multiple solutions to the TE-CCR\nof the same category, i. e. multiple solutions to the TECCR with identical canonical domains. To be able to answer this question, there is a need to determine a mathematical property of a given solution to the TE-CCR\nwhich is independent of the solution's canonical domain;\nthis mathematical property can then be utilized to distinguish between multiple solutions to the TE-CCR of the\nsame category. There is also a need to determine whether\nmultiple solutions to the TE-CCR of the same category\nhave identical dynamical behaviors. If a mathematical\nproperty is found that can be utilized to distinguish between multiple soltuions to the TE-CCR of the same category, and if multiple solutions to the TE-CCR of the\nsame category do not have identical dynamical behaviors, then one can distinguish between multiple solutions\nto the TE-CCR not just using a certain mathematical\nproperty, but also by means of the system's internal unitary dynamics. We will attempt to answer this question\nin the next two sections of the paper.\n\nIII. EXISTENCE OF MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS\nTO THE TE-CCR OF CLOSED CATEGORY\n\nLet us first consider multiple solutions to the TE-CCR\ndescribed in the previous section, all of which which have\nnon-dense, or closed, canonical domains. One possible\nsolution to the TE-CCR of closed category has been described in references [25, 27]. This solution to the TECCR is known as the confined quantum time of arrival\n(CTOA) operator, constructed via Weyl quantization of\nthe classical arrival time t = \u2212\u03bcqp\u22121 for this system. It\nis this solution to the TE-CCR that we use to generate\n\n\f3\nother solutions to the TE-CCR of closed category.\nTo see how the CTOA operator can be used to generate other solutions to the TE-CCR of closed category, let\nus consider the classical arrival time for a given particle\ndefined in an arbitrary physical system. The most general quantization of the classical arrival time for a given\nparticle will result in the following operator:\nT = \u2212\u03bc\n\nqp\u22121 + p\u22121 q + is(qp\u22121 \u2212 p\u22121 q)\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere q and p\u22121 are the position and inverse momentum\noperators for the system, and s is a real number denoting\nthe method of quantization used. Now for the physical\nsystem described in the previous section, equation 1 can\nbe expressed in position representation as follows:\n(T\u03b3,s,1 \u03c6) (q) =\n\nZ\n\nl\n\nhq| T\u03b3,s,1 |q \u2032 i T\u03b3,s,1 (q, q \u2032 )\u03c6(q \u2032 )dq \u2032 (2)\n\n\u2212l\n\nfor \u03b3 6= 0, where hq| T\u03b3,s,1 |q \u2032 i has the form\n\u03bc\n\u00d7\n4~ sin \u03b3\n\u0001\nei\u03b3 H(q \u2212 q \u2032 ) + e\u2212i\u03b3 H(q \u2032 \u2212 q) ((q + q \u2032 ) + is(q \u2212 q \u2032 ))\n(3)\n\nhq| T\u03b3,s,1 |q \u2032 i = \u2212\n\nand\n(T0,s,1 \u03c6) (q) =\n\nZ\n\nl\n\nhq| T0,s,1 |q \u2032 i \u03c6(q \u2032 )dq \u2032\n\n\u2212l\n\n(4)\nfor \u03b3 = 0, and where hq| T0,s,1 |q \u2032 i has the form\n\u03bci\n((q + q \u2032 ) + is(q \u2212 q \u2032 ))sgn(q \u2212 q \u2032 )\n4~\n\u0001\n\u03bci\n+\n(5)\n(q 2 \u2212 q \u20322 ) \u2212 is(q \u2212 q \u2032 )2\n4~l\nhq| T0,s,1 |q \u2032 i = \u2212\n\nWe note that equation 5 was first stated in reference [33].\nThe first terms in equations 3 and 5 are just the kernels\nfor the CTOA operators T\u03b3,1 and T0,1 respectively,\nand\n\u0001\ncorrespond to the term 2\u22121 \u03bc qp\u22121 + p\u22121 q in equation\n1. The second term in equations 3 and 5, on the other\n\u0001\nhand, correspond to the term 2\u22121 is\u03bc qp\u22121 \u2212 p\u22121 q in\nequation 1 which in turn commutes with the Hamiltonian H\u03b3 . It can be shown that equations 3 and 5 are\nsquare integrable, which implies that the operators T\u03b3,s,1\nand T0,s,1 are self-adjoint and compact. As such, the operators T\u03b3,s,1 and T\u03b3,s,1 are constructed by adding to\nthe CTOA operators T\u03b3,1 and T0,1 a term which commutes with the Hamiltonian, but which at the same time\nensures the self-adjointness and compactness of the resulting operators.\nSince the second term of the operators T\u03b3,s,1 and T0,s,1\ncommute with the Hamiltonian, the canonical domains of\nthe operators T\u03b3,s,1 and T\u03b3,1 are identical, and so are the\ncanonical domains of the operators T0,s,1 and T0,1 . And\n\nsince s is a real number, there are an infinite number\nof solutions to the TE-CCR T\u03b3,s,1 and T0,s,1 that can\nexist, each of which can be distinguished from each other\nby means of their corresponding values of s. However,\nis it still possible to distinguish, either mathematically\nor physically, between multiple solutions to the TE-CCR\nT\u03b3,s,1 without having to determine the exact value of the\nparameter s corresponding to them? We will answer this\nquestion in the next subsection, and in so doing we will be\nable to clarify the role of the parameter s corresponding\nto the solution to the TE-CCR T\u03b3,s,1 of closed category.\nA. Use of Internal Symmetries to Distinguish\nBetween Multiple Solutions to the TE-CCR\n\nThe role of the parameter s in T\u03b3,s,1 can be determined by examining the internal symmetries satisfied by\nT\u03b3,s,1 . It was shown in references [25, 27] that the CTOA\noperator T\u03b3,1 satisfies the following internal symmetries:\n\u03a0\u22121 \u0398\u22121 T\u03b3,1 \u0398\u03a0 = \u2212T\u03b3\n\u0398\u22121 T\u03b3,1 \u0398 = \u2212T\u2212\u03b3\n\u03a0\u22121 T\u03b3,1 \u03a0 = T\u2212\u03b3\n(6)\nwhere \u03a0 is the parity reversal operator, (\u03a0\u03c6) (q)\u03c6(\u2212q) =\nand \u0398 is the time reversal operator, (\u0398\u03c6) (q) = \u03c6 \u2217 (q).\nThe physical significance of these internal symmetries\nwere discussed in reference [27]. It can be shown that\nnone of these symmetries are satisfied by T\u03b3,s,1 if s 6= 0,\ndue to the presence of the second term in equation 3.\nAs such, the parameter s corresponding to T\u03b3,s,1 serves\nto break three particular internal symmetries for T\u03b3,s,1 ,\nwith the explicit form of those symmetries given by equation 6, and we can then mathematically distinguish between T\u03b3,s,1 and T\u03b3,1 in terms of the internal symmetries\nspecified in equation 6.\nIt was also shown in references [25, 27] that the CTOA\noperator T0,1 satisfies the following internal symmetries:\n\u0398\u22121 T0,1 \u0398 = \u2212T0\n\u03a0\u22121 T0,1 \u03a0 = T0\n(7)\nThe physical significance of these internal symmetries are\ndiscussed in reference [27]. None of these symmetries are\nsatisfied by T0,s,1 , again due to the presence of the second\nterm in equation 5. So the role of s as an internal symmetry breaking parameter is further underscored, and we\nthen see that the CTOA operator T0,1 differs from the\nsolution to the TE-CCR T0,s,1 respectively with respect\nto the internal symmetry given in equation 7.\nWe pay particular attention to the second internal\nsymmetry specified in equation 6 and the first internal\nsymmetry specified in equation 7. Those internal symmetries, which involve the use of the time reversal operator alone, correspond to the following symmetry obeyed\n\n\f4\nby the classical arrival time:\n\u2212 t(q, p) = t(q, \u2212p)\n\n(8)\n\nWe note that equation 8 implies that a reversal of the\nclassical arrival time can be carried out by a reversal\nof momentum. However, the second internal symmetry\nspecified in equation 6 implies that due to the presence\nof the phase factor \u03b3, in order for a full time reversal\nto occur, the phase must be reversed as well, since only\nby reversing the phase can the momentum be reversed.\nBecause of this additional phase reversal operation, the\nsecond internal symmetry in equation 6 cannot be considered as a full time reversal symmetry despite it being\nthe quantum analogue of equation 8. Instead, we call\nthis internal symmetry \u03c4 -symmetry. However, the first\ninternal symmetry in equation 7 does not involve a reversal of the phase factor \u03b3 in order for full time reversal\nto take place, and merely requires that the momentum\nbe reversed; this internal symmetry is then said to be\na proper time reversal operation. As such, we then say\nthat the CTOA operator T\u03b3,1 is \u03c4 -symmetric, whereas\nthe solution to the TE-CCR T\u03b3,s,1 is non \u03c4 -symmetric.\nSimilarly, we say that the CTOA operator T0,1 is time\nreversal symmetric, whereas the solution to the TE-CCR\nT\u03b3,s,1 is non time reversal symmetric. We note that time\nreversal symmetry is a special case of \u03c4 -symmetry, which\ncan only be seen when \u03b3 = 0.\n\nB.\n\nPhysical Implications of \u03c4 -symmetry\n\nWe have shown in the previous section that it is possible to distinguish between the solutions to the TE-CCR\nT\u03b3,1 and T\u03b3,s,1 as well as the solutions to the TE-CCR\nT0,1 and T0,s,1 via the internal symmetries given by equations 6 and 7 respectively. An effect of the lack of \u03c4 symmetry in T\u03b3,s,1 is that unlike the CTOA operator,\nall positive eigenvalues of T\u03b3,s,1 will not have negative\neigenvalue counterparts of equal magnitude; that is, if \u03c4n\nis a positive eigenvalue of T\u03b3,s,1 , then there will exist no\nnegative eigenvalue \u2212\u03c4n\u2032 of T\u03b3,s,1 such that |\u2212\u03c4n\u2032 | = |\u03c4n |.\nHowever, this is not just the only effect of the lack of\n\u03c4 -symmetry in T\u03b3,s,1 . To be able to determine other effects of the lack of \u03c4 -symmetry in T\u03b3,s,1 , we will compare\nthe time evolution of the eigenfunctions of T\u03b3,1 with the\neigenfunctions of T\u03b3,s,1 , and the time evolution of the\neigenfunctions of T0,s,1 with the eigenfunctions of T0,s,1 .\n\n1.\n\nComputation of the Eigenfunctions and the Eigenvalues\nof T\u03b3,s,1\n\nwritten in the following form:\nZ l\n\u03bc\n\u03c6s,1\n(q)\n=\n\u2212\n((q + q \u2032 ) + is(q \u2212 q \u2032 )) \u00d7\nn,\u03b3,\u03bd\n4\u03c4n ~ sin \u03b3 \u2212l\n\u0001\n\u2032\n\u2032\nei\u03b3 H(q \u2212 q \u2032 ) + e\u2212i\u03b3 H(q \u2032 \u2212 q) \u03c6s,1\nn,\u03b3,\u03bd (q )dq\n(9)\nwhere \u03c6s,1\nn,\u03b3,\u03bd are the eigenfunctions of T\u03b3,s,1 and \u03c4n the\ncorresponding eigenvalues. We solve for the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of T\u03b3,s,1 in the same manner that\nwe solved for the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the\nCTOA operator in reference [25, 27].

Furthermore, the instant of time\nwhen \u03c3 2 (t) is a minimum, tmin , will be farther away from\ns,1,e\nthe eigenvalue corresponding to \u03c6n,0,\u03bd\n(q, t), \u03c4n , as s increases, as shown in figures 4B to 4D. Hence, we can then\nconclude that the physical interpretation of the time reversal symmetric solution to the TE-CCR T0,1 is different\nfrom the physical interpretation of the non time reversal\nsymmetric solution to the TE-CCR T0,s,1 .\n\nIV. EXISTENCE OF MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS\nTO THE TE-CCR OF DENSE CATEGORY\n\nHaving shown that multiple solutions to the TE-CCR\nof closed category can be constructed, and having shown\nthat it is possible to physically distinguish between these\nmultiple solutions to the TE-CCR of closed category\nfrom each other via \u03c4 -symmetry, we proceed to determine whether the same is true for multiple solutions to\nthe TE-CCR of dense category.\n\nA.\n\nhave the following form in position representation:\n\nSolutions to the TE-CCR of Dense Category\n\nLet us now consider the second category of solutions\nT\u03b3,\u03b1,2 to the TE-CCR. Falling under this category is the\ncharacteristic time operator, or CTO, which was first introduced by Galapon in reference [24] and whose physical interpretation was given in reference [32]. Now it\nhas been shown by Galapon in reference [24] that the\nCTO can generate an infinite number of self-adjoint and\ncompact solutions to the TE-CCR of dense category, by\nadding a term which commutes with the system's Hamiltonian H\u03b3 . The resulting time operator, which we call\nthe generalized characteristic time operator (GTO), will\n\nZ\n\nl\n\nhq| T\u03b3,\u03b1,2 |q \u2032 i \u03c6(q \u2032 )dq \u2032\n\n(19)\n\n\u2212l\n\nwhere the kernel hq| T\u03b3,\u03b1,2 |q \u2032 i of the GTO T\u03b3,s,2 has the\nfollowing explicit form:\nhq| T\u03b3,\u03b1,2 |q \u2032 i = i~\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\u2217 \u2032\n\u2032 \u03c6k (q)\u03c6k\u2032 (q )\n\nk,k\u2032 =\u2212\u221e\n\u221e\nX\n\nEk \u2212 Ek\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\u03b1k \u03c6\u03b3k (q)\u03c6\u03b3\u2217\nk (q )\n\n+\n(20)\n\nk=\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere the prime in the summation denotes that k 6= k \u2032\nand \u03b1k is an element of a bounded sequence of real num\u221e\nbers \u03b1 = {\u03b1k }k=1 , which we call the \u03b1 sequence corresponding to the GTO. Note that the first term of equation 20 is actually the kernel for the CTO, while the second term of equation 20 can be shown to commute with\nthe Hamiltonian of the system. As such, this implies that\nthe GTO is still a solution to the TE-CCR of dense category, with the canonical domain of the GTO identical\nto the canonical domain of the CTO. Furthermore, imposing appropriate conditions\nof the real\nP\u221e on the elements\n2\nvalued sequence \u03b1, e. g. k=\u2212\u221e |\u03b1k | < \u221e ensures that\nequation 20 is square integrable, which means the GTO\nis self-adjoint and compact. Because there are an infinite\nnumber of \u03b1 sequences that can be chosen to ensure that\nthe GTO is self-adjoint, compact and a solution to the\nTE-CCR of dense category, there now arises the question\nof whether we can mathematically and physically distinguish between multiple GTOs without having to resort\nto determining the explicit form of their corresponding\n\u03b1 sequences. We will answer this question in the next\nportion of the paper, but before we do so, let us first examine the physical interpretation of the CTO and how it\ncan be shown to be mathematically distinct from other\nforms of the GTO.\nB.\n\nPhysical interpretation of the CTO and how it\nis mathematically distinct from the GTO\n\nThe physical interpretation of the CTO was first stated\nin reference [32], and was made using the function\nPt [n, n\u2032 ] = |h\u03c6n\u2032 ,\u03b3,\u03bd | Ut |\u03c6n,\u03b3,\u03bd i|2\n\n(21)\n\nwhich is also known as the transition probability, or\nthe probability that the time evolved CTO eigenfunctions |\u03c6n,\u03b3,\u03bd (t) i will make a transition to |\u03c6n\u2032 ,\u03b3,\u03bd i at\nan instant of time t. As shown in figure 5a, the plot of\nPt [n, n\u2032 ] as a function of time will have a single, welldefined peak whose maximum value is numerically close\nto, if not equal to, one, at an instant of time tmax ; furthermore, the peak will be very narrow, signifying that\nany measurement of the instant when |\u03c6n,\u03b3,\u03bd i will make\n\n\f8\n\nC.\n\nPhysical Implications of \u03c4 -Symmetry on the\nGTO\n\nWe now investigate the effects of the presence or absence of \u03c4 -symmetry in the GTO. To do so, we first compute for the eignfunctions and eigenvalues of a particular\nform of the GTO. We then evolve the eigenfunctions of\nthis GTO, over time, and compare the dynamics of this\nGTO with the dynamics of the time-evolved CTO eigenfunctions.\n\n1\n\n1\nPt[200,201]\n\n0.8\n\nComputation of the Eigenvalues and the Eigenfunctions\nof the GTO\n\nWe compute for the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of\nthe GTO using the methods presented in reference [32]\nto compute for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the\nCTO. Specifically, we use the energy representation of\nthe GTO, which is an infinite matrix whose nondiagonal\nelements are identical to the nondiagonal elements of the\nenergy representation of the CTO. However, the diagonal\nelements of the energy representation of the GTO will\nhave the explicit form\n(T\u03b3,\u03b1,2 )j,j = \u03b1k\n\n(22)\n\nwhich are different from the diagonal elements of the energy representation of the CTO, which are all equal to\nzero. We then truncate the resulting infinite matrix and\n\nP [200,202]\nt\n\n0.8\n\nPt[200,203]\n\nPt[200,203]\nPt[200,204]\n\nTRANS PROB\n\nTRANS PROB\n\nPt[200,204]\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n(a)\n\n3\nTIME\n\n4\n\n0\n0\n(b)\n\n5\nx 10\n\n\u22125\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nTIME\n\n1\nx 10\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22126\n\n0.8\n\n1.8\nPt[200,201]\n\n0.7\n\nPt[200,203]\n\n0.6\n\nx 10\n\nPt[200,201]\n\n1.6\n\nPt[200,202]\n\nPt[200,202]\nP [200,203]\n\n1.4\n\nt\n\nP [200,204]\n\nPt[200,204]\n\nTRANS PROB\n\nt\n\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0\n0\n(c)\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\nTIME\n\n0.8\n\n1\nx 10\n\n\u22124\n\n0\n0\n(d)\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nTIME\n\n1\nx 10\n\n\u22125\n\nFIG. 5: Plot of the transition probability Pt [n, n\u2032 ] =\n|h\u03c6n+1 | Ut \u03c6n i|2 corresponding to the time evolved GTO\neigenfunctions as a function of time, with the GTO eigenfunctions corresponding to GTOs with \u03b1 sequences \u03b1 = {0}\u221e\nk=\u2212\u221e\no\u221e\nn\no\u221e\nn\n\u22121\n\u221220\n(a), \u03b1 = 50Ek,\u03b3\n(b), \u03b1 = 50Ek,\u03b3\n(c) and\nk=\u2212\u221e\no\u221e k=\u2212\u221e\nn\n\u221225\n\u03b1 = 50Ek,\u03b3\n(d).\nk=\u2212\u221e\n\ncompute for the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the resulting finite truncated matrix.

On the\nother hand, as shown in figure 6a, plotting tmax as a\nfunction of \u03c4n \u2212 \u03c4n\u2032 will result in a linear graph whose\nslope is numerically very close to, if not equal to, one,\nwith \u03c4n \u2212 \u03c4n\u2032 asymptotically approaching zero, signifying that tmax is numerically very close to, if not equal\nto, \u03c4n \u2212 \u03c4n\u2032 . Based on these plots, the CTO can be interpreted as a time operator whose time-evolved eigenfunctions |\u03c6n,\u03b3,\u03bd (t) i = Ut |\u03c6n,\u03b3,\u03bd i will make transitions\nto other CTO eigenfunctions |\u03c6n\u2032 ,\u03b3,\u03bd i at an instant of\ntime very close to, if not equal to, t = \u03c4n \u2212 \u03c4n\u2032 , the difference between the eigenvalues corresponding to those\neigenfunctions, so long as the difference between those\neigenvalues asymptotically approaches zero.\nNow the CTO and the GTO are distinct from each\nother with respect to \u03c4 -symmetry. In particular, the\nCTO is \u03c4 -symmetric; this can be shown by making use of\nthe observation that Ek,\u03b3 = E\u2212k,\u2212\u03b3 . However, it can be\nshown that the GTO T\u03b3,\u03b1,2 does not satisfy \u03c4 -symmetry;\nthis is due to the presence of the \u03b1 sequence in the GTO's\nkernel. Hence, we can distinguish between the CTO and\nthe GTO via \u03c4 -symmetry, with the CTO T\u03b3,2 being \u03c4 symmetric and the GTO T\u03b3,\u03b1,2 not \u03c4 -symmetric. Also,\nthe \u03b1 sequence can then be seen as a \u03c4 -symmetry breaking sequence for a GTO so long as it has nonzero elements.\n\nTime Evolution of the GTO Eigenfunctions\n\nOnce we are able to compute for the eigenfunctions of\nthe GTO, we then proceed to evolve these eigenfunctions\nover time, and we utilize the transition probability, whose\nexplicit form is given by equation 21, in order to determine the probability that a time-evolved GTO eigen0,2\nfunction Ut \u03c60,2\nn,\u03b3,\u03bd i = \u03c6n,\u03b3,\u03bd (t) i will make a transition\nto another GTO eigenfunction \u03c60,2\nn,\u03b3,\u03bd i . We then compare the resulting transition probabilities corresponding\nto the time-evolved GTO eigenfunctions with the transition probabilities corresponding to the time-evolved CTO\neigenfunctions. The \u03b1 sequence\nn of the\no\u221e GTO to be con\u2212n\nsidered in this section is \u03b1 = Ek,\u03b3\n, with n \u2265 2\nk=\u2212\u221e\n\nand Ek,\u03b3 the energy eigenvalues for the system, which is\nnot \u03c4 -symmetric. This \u03b1 sequence was chosen in order\nto ensure that the kernel for the GTO will remain square\nintegrable, thus preserving the self-adjointness and compactness of the GTO.\n\n\f9\n\u22126\n\n10\n\neigenvalues \u03c4n \u2212\u03c4n\u2032 corresponding to the GTO eigenfunctions used to compute the transition probability, even if\n\u03c4n \u2212 \u03c4n\u2032 \u2192 0. As such, one cannot then physically interpret the GTO T2,\u03b1,\u03b3 whose corresponding \u03b1 sequences\nwill have nonzero elements in the same manner as the\nCTO T2,0,\u03b3 .\n\n\u22125\n\nx 10\n\nx 10\n\n1.9\n9.5\n\n1.85\n\nTIME MAX\n\nTIME MAX\n\n1.8\n9\n\n8.5\n\n1.75\n1.7\n1.65\n1.6\n\n8\n\n1.55\n1.5\n8\n\n8.5\n\n(a)\n2\n\nx 10\n\n9\n\n\u03c4n\u2212\u03c4n+1\n\n9.5\n\n10\nx 10\n\n1.45\n\n1.5\n\n1.6\n\n(b)\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22125\n\n1.7\n\u03c4n\u2212\u03c4n+1\n\n1.8\n\n1.9\n\u22125\nx 10\n\nV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\n\u22125\n\n3.5\n\nx 10\n\nThe results of our analysis of the dynamics of the GTO\neigenfunctions via the transition probability are shown in\nfigures 5 and 6. Figures 5b to 5d show that the plot of\nthe transition probability generated by the time-evolved\nGTO eigenfunctions will most likely not have a single,\nwell-defined peak which is localized at a single instant\nof time tmax , and if there is such a peak, the height of\nthe peak will not be very close to or even equal to one.\nFurthermore, figures 6b to 6d show that the time when\nPt [n, n\u2032 ] will attain a maximum value, tmax , will not be\nclose to, or even equal to, the difference between the\n\nWe have shown in this work that there exist multiple\nsolutions to the TE-CCR of the same category, which\nmay be distinguished from each other via particular internal symmetries involving time reversal, in particular\nthe symmetry which we call \u03c4 -symmetry. We have also\nshown that the presence or absence of \u03c4 -symmetry in\nparticular elements of a given set of solutions to the TECCR of the same category can affect the dynamics of\nthose solutions to the TE-CCR, thus affecting not just\nthe manner by which we interpret those solutions to the\nTE-CCR via the system's internal unitary dynamics, but\nalso ensuring that certain \u03c4 -symmetric solutions to the\nTE-CCR of a given category will be physically distinct\nfrom their non \u03c4 -symmetric counterparts within that category.\nThis work, however, raises questions with regards to\nthe precise role of the system's internal symmetries in\nformulating quantum time observables. In particular,\nhow exactly are we to interpret non \u03c4 -symmetric quantum time observables? More generally, is \u03c4 -symmetry\nnecessary in order to physically interpret quantum time\nobservables? To be able to answer both of these questions, it is necessary to further investigate the dynamical\nbehavior of the non \u03c4 -symmetric ATO and GTO, in order for us to be able to determine whether or not one\ncan still use the system's internal unitary dynamics to\nprovide a physical interpretation to the ATO and GTO,\nand determine as well whether \u03c4 -symmetry, or in general\nthe internal symmetries of a system, is necessary in order\nto formulate solutions to the TE-CCR.\nThis work has been supported by a UP System Grant.\n\n[1] Y.
