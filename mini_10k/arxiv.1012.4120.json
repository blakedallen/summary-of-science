GURJAR, M. KORAS*, M. MIYANISHI** AND P. RUSSELL***\n\nAbstract. We show that a homology plane of general type has at\nworst a single cyclic quotient singular point. An example of such\na surface with a singular point does exist [MS, Theorem 3.1]. We\nalso show that the automorphism group of a smooth contractible\nsurface of general type is cyclic.\n\n0. Introduction.\nRecall that a normal affine surface V such that the singular homology\ngroups Hi (V, Z) = (0) for i > 0 is called a Z-homology plane (simply a\nhomology plane). Similarly, a Q-homology plane is defined. In [GKMR,\nLemma 3.2] it was shown that if V is a Q-homology plane such that the\nlogarithmic Kodaira dimension \u03ba(V \\ Sing V ) = 2, then V has at most\none singular point and it is a quotient singular point. In particular, V\nis rational by [GPS, GP].\nIn this paper we will prove the following result.\nTheorem 1. Let S \u2032 be a Z-homology plane. If \u03ba(S \u2032 \\SingS \u2032 ) = 2, then\nS \u2032 has at most one singular point and it is a cyclic quotient singularity.\nAs an application of Theorem 1 we will prove the following result\nabout the automorphism group of a smooth contractible (hence affine)\nsurface of general type.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification.

GURJAR, M. KORAS*, M. MIYANISHI** AND P. RUSSELL***\n\nTheorem 2. Let V be a smooth homology plane with \u03ba(V ) = 2.\nSuppose that Aut(V ) 6= {1}. Then we have the following assertions.\n(1) Aut(V ) has a unique fixed point p and the action of Aut(V ) is\nfree on V \\ {p}.\n(2) Aut(V ) is a finite cyclic group isomorphic to a small subgroup\nof GL(2, C) (in the induced action on the tangent space at p).\n(3) The quotient surface V \u2032 := V /Aut(V ) has a unique singular\npoint q and the local fundamental group at q is isomorphic to\nAut(V ). If V is simply connected, then \u03c01 (V \u2032 \\ q) = Aut(V ).\nIn [GKMR], we proved that a normal affine contractible surface V\nsuch that \u03c01 (V \\ Sing V ) = (1) is actually smooth. The proof used a\ndeep result due to C. Taubes involving gauge theory. Our proof of Theorem 1 relies entirely on algebraic surface theory and avoids Taubes's\nresult. We first establish that the boundary divisor for a possible counterexample is star-shaped, see Lemma 4.3. We then present two quite\ndifferent arguments to finish the proof. In the first approach we use\ndetailed computations of numerical data for the boundary divisor to\nshow in the end that a counterexample does not exist. In the second\napproach we present a more conceptual argument based on observations concerning singular points on normal affine surfaces with good\nC\u2217 -actions. We have kept both approaches since the second is quite\ninteresting in its own right, and since we believe that the first can\neventually be sharpened to give a global bound for the order of the\nlocal fundamental group in Theorem 1.\n1. Preliminaries\nOur proof of Theorem 1 uses several results and terminology from the\ntheory of open algebraic surfaces. The book [Mi] is a good reference for\nmost of the terminology and basic results from this theory used here.\nIn order to keep the length of the paper to a minimum we refer the\nreader to [Mi] for any terms not defined here. We will also use some\nresults from T. Fujita's paper [F], particularly \u00a7\u00a73, 4, 5, 6.\nWe will only deal with complex algebraic or analytic varieties. We\nwill write the canonical divisor KX of a normal surface X simply K\nwhen there is no possibility of confusion. A smooth projective rational\ncurve C on a smooth projective surface Z is a (\u2212n)-curve if C 2 = \u2212n.\nWe will need this terminology mainly for n = 0, 1, 2. A P1 -fibration\non a normal projective surface Z is a morphism f : Z \u2192 B onto a\nsmooth projective curve B such that a general fiber of f is isomorphic\nto P1 . A simple normal crossing divisor D on a smooth quasi-projective\n\n\fSINGULARITIES OF A HOMOLOGY PLANE OF GENERAL TYPE\n\n3\n\nsurface will be called an SNC divisor. An irreducible component of an\nSNC divisor D will be simply called a component of D if there is no\nconfusion. For any component D0 of D the connected components of\nD \u2212 D0 which meet D0 are called the branches of D at D0 and their\nnumber is called the branching number of D0 . A component D0 is called\na branching component of D if the branching number is \u2265 3, i.e., if D0\nmeets at least three other components of D. If D is an SNC divisor\nsuch that any (\u22121)-curve in D is a branching component of D then\nwe say that D is an MNC divisor to mean a minimal normal crossing\ndivisor.\nFor an SNC divisor D which is a tree (i.e., a connected union of\nrational curves without loops), we use the terms tip, twig, maximal\nrational twig, etc, from [F, \u00a73]. For an SNC divisor D with components\nDi we denote by d(D) the determinant of the matrix (\u2212(Di * Dj )). We\nrefer to [KR, 2.1.1] for rewriting d(D) in terms of the determinants of\na branching component and its branches.\nFor a smooth projective surface X and a (possibly disconnected)\nSNC-divisor D on X, if \u03ba(X \\ D) \u2265 0, then K + D has a ZariskiFujita decomposition K + D \u2248 P + N where \u2248 denotes the numerical\nequivalence. Here P, N are Q-divisors, P is nef, N is effective, the\nintersection form on the irreducible components of Supp N is negative\ndefinite and P * Di = 0 for any component Di in Supp N. If N is\nnot equal to the bark of D, denoted by Bk (D), then X contains a\n(\u22121)-curve C not contained in D which meets D transversally in at\nmost two points. If C meets D in two points, the intersection points\non D belong to components D1 , D2 contained in distinct connected\ncomponents A, B. Furthermore, either A and B are linear chains, or\nA is a fork and B is a linear chain [Mi, Chapter 2, 3.7]. See also [F,\nLemma 6.20]. The bark of an admissible rational fork T is denoted by\nBk (T ) in [Mi] and by Bk \u2217 (T ) (and called the thicker bark) in [F]. To\navoid a confusion, we employ the notation in [Mi] and call it the bark\nof a fork. We say that the pair (Y, F ) is almost minimal, or that the\ndivisor F is almost-minimal if the reference to Y is clear, if N = Bk(F )\nand P = KY +F # with F # = F \u2212Bk(F ). Given a pair (X, D) as above,\nthere exists a birational morphism \u03c3 : X \u2192 Y such that Y is a smooth\nprojective surface, F = \u03c3\u2217 (D) is an SNC divisor and (Y, F ) is almost\nminimal. By [Mi, Theorem 3.11], we have \u03c3\u2217 (KX + D # ) \u2265 KY + F # .\nIf (X, D) is almost minimal, the nef part P = KX + D # is obtained by\npeeling off the bark Bk (D) by the theory of peeling [Mi].\nWe say that an SNC divisor T is contractible if it contracts to a\nquotient singular point or a smooth point. Note that the intersection\nmatrix of T is then negative definite and d(T ) > 0.\n\n\f4\n\nR.V. GURJAR, M. KORAS*, M. MIYANISHI** AND P. RUSSELL***\n\nAs a matter of notation, if D, D \u2032 are reduced effective divisors with\nD' a part of D, D \u2212 D \u2032 denotes the union of the irreducible components\nof D that are not components of of D \u2032 . This is subtly different from\nthe the set-theoretic difference D \\ D \u2032 .\nWe will need the following useful result about singular fibers of a\nP1 -fibration f : Z \u2192 B on a smooth projective surface Z [Mi, Chapter\n1, Lemma 2.11.2].\nLemma 1.1. Let F0 be a scheme-theoretic fiber of f which is not isomorphic to P1 . Then we have the following assertions.\n(a) F0 contains a (\u22121)-curve.\n(b) If a (\u22121)-curve E in F0 occurs with multiplicity 1 in F0 then\nF0 contains another (\u22121)-curve.\n(c) By successively contracting (\u22121)-curves in F0 we can contract\nF0 to a smooth fiber of the induced P1 -fibration on the surface\nobtained from Z by blowing downs.\n(d) The dual graph of F0 is a tree.\n(e) A (\u22121)-curve in F0 of multiplicity m > 1 meets at most two\nother irreducible components of F0 and if m = 1 it meets precisely one.\n(f) Suppose that F0 contains exactly one (\u22121)-curve C and let F0 \\\nC = R \u222a T be the decomposition into connected components.\nThen F0 contains at most two components with multiplicity 1. If\nR contains an irreducible component of multiplicity 1, then T is\na chain. If both R and T contain a component with multiplicity\n1, then F0 is a chain.\nWe will use the following consequence of Lemma 1.1, which is probably well-known to experts.\nLemma 1.2. Let f : Z \u2192 B be a P1 -fibration on a normal projective\nsurface Z and let F0 be a scheme-theoretic fiber of f which is not a\nsmooth fiber. Then Z has at worst rational singularities at points on\nF0 . If an irreducible component C of F0 occurs with multiplicity 1 in\nF0 then Z is smooth at any point on C which does not lie on any other\nirreducible component of F0 .\nLet C be a (0)-curve on a smooth projective rational surface Z.\nThen the linear system |C| induces a P1 -fibration on Z with C as a\nfiber. We record the following consequences of this fact which we will\nuse repeatedly below.\nLemma 1.3. Let Z be a smooth projective rational surface and T a\nSNC-divisor on Z consisting of rational curves. Suppose one of the\n\n\fSINGULARITIES OF A HOMOLOGY PLANE OF GENERAL TYPE\n\n5\n\nfollowing.\n(a) A maximal twig L of T is a non-contractible linear chain.\n(b) A linear chain L connecting two branching components of T is not\ncontractible.\nThen by blowing up and down over L we can replace Z by a smooth\nprojective surface Z \u2032 , T by an SNC-divisor T \u2032 and L by a linear chain\nL\u2032 such that Z \u2032 \\ T \u2032 = Z \\ T and L\u2032 contains a (0)-curve C which is a\ntip of L\u2032 and a tip of T \u2032 in case (a).\nC induces a C-fibration of Z \\ T in case (a) and a C\u2217 -firation in case\n(b).\nHere by a C- (resp. C\u2217 -) fibration of a surface Y we mean a morphism to a curve with general fiber C (resp. C\u2217 ). By the easy addition theorem for Kodaira dimension (see [Mi, Lemma 1.13.1]) we have\n\u03ba(Y ) = \u2212\u221e (resp. \u03ba(Y ) \u2264 1) if Y has a C- (resp. C\u2217 -) fibration. So\nwe obtain\nCorollary 1.4. If \u03ba(Z \\ T ) = 2, then an L as in Lemma 1.3 does not\nexist.\nIn several places below we use the following formula of Fujita [F,\n4.15,4.16].\nLemma 1.5. Let f : Z \u2192 B be a P1 -fibration on a smooth projective\nsurface Z and D a reduced effective divisor on Z. Then\nh \u2212 \u03a3 + \u03bd \u2212 2 = eb1 \u2212 bb2 = b2 (D) \u2212 b2 (Z).\n\nHere h is the number of components of D that are horizontal for f , \u03bd\nis the number of fibers of f contained in D, \u03a3 is the sum over all other\nfibers F of \u03c3(F ) \u2212 1, with \u03c3(F ) the number of components of F not in\nD, and eb1 , bb2 are modified Betti numbers of Z \\ D introduced by Fujita\nin [F, 1.13].\nIn our arguments an inequality of Bogomolov-Miyaoka-Yau type\n(simply the BMY-inequality) proved by R. Kobayashi, S. Nakamura\nand F. Sakai plays a crucial role. The formulation best suited to our\npurpose is found in [GM, Lemma 8 and Corollary 9] (see also see [Mi,\nChapter 2, Theorem 6.6.2]) and stated as follows.\n\nLemma 1.6. Let (X, D) be a relatively minimal log-projective surface\nwith log-terminal singularities. Namely, if (X, D) be the minimal resolution of (X, D) with D the reduced sum of the proper transform of D\nand the exceptional locus E, then (X, D) is almost minimal. Suppose\nthat \u03ba(X \\ D) \u2265 0 and that X \\ D is quasi-affine.\n\n\f6\n\nR.V. GURJAR, M. KORAS*, M. MIYANISHI** AND P. RUSSELL***\n\n(i) We have the inequality\n\u03c7(X \\ D) +\n\nX 1\n\u22650,\n|Gp |\np\n\nwhere p ranges over all singular points of X \\ D and Gp is the local\nfundamental group.\n(ii) If \u03ba(X \\ D) = 2 the above inequality is strict.\nHere and later we use \u03c7 to denote topological Euler characteristic.\nThe original BMY-inequality is the case (ii), and A. Langer [L] has\nextended it in the form (i). We will use both versions.\nNow let S \u2032 be as in the statement of Theorem 1. Let \u03c0 : S \u2192 S \u2032\nbe a minimal resolution of singularities. Let E = \u03c0 \u22121 (Sing S \u2032 ). We\nconsider E as a reduced divisor. Let S \u2283 S be a smooth projective\nsurface such that D := S \\ S is an SNC-divisor. We will assume that\nD is an MNC divisor. By [KR, Proposition 2.6 (iii)], the irreducible\ncomponents of D \u222a E form a basis of Pic (S) \u2297 Q. Hence they are\nnumerically independent.\nLemma 1.7. Under the assumption of Theorem 1, S \u2032 has only one\nsingular point q and it is a quotient singularity. Furthermore, S \u2032 is a\nrational surface and H1 (S; Z) = H1 (S \u2032 ; Z) = 0.\nProof. The proof of the first assertion is the same as the proof of Lemma\n3.2 in [GKMR]. For the second assertion, we have \u03c01 (S) = \u03c01 (S \u2032 ) by\n[KR, Lemma 2.3.1], which implies H1 (S; Z) = H1 (S \u2032 ; Z). Since S \u2032 is\nZ-acyclic, H1 (S \u2032 ; Z) = 0. For the rationality of S \u2032 , we refer to [GP]. \u0003\nAn irreducible curve C in S is called a simple curve if C \u2243 P1 , C 6\u2282\nD \u222aE, C *D = 1 and C *E \u2264 1. The assumption that \u03ba(S \u2032 \\Sing S \u2032 ) = 2\nimplies the following result.\nLemma 1.8. There is no simple curve C in S.\nProof. See the proof of 2.12 in [KR].\nIn the terminology of [Mi, Chapter 2, 4.3] we state this result as:\nCorollary 1.9. The pair (S, D + E) is almost minimal.\nLemma 1.10. The following assertions hold.\n(1) D is a rational tree.\n(2) |d(D)| = d(E) > 0.\nWe put a=d(E).\n\n\u0003\n\n\fSINGULARITIES OF A HOMOLOGY PLANE OF GENERAL TYPE\n\n7\n\nProof. For (1), see for instance the proof of 2.6 (iv) in [KR]. The proof\nof (2) is similar to the proof of 2.9 in [KR].\n\u0003\nWe set up some notation.\nSetup 1.11. Let Y be a smooth projective surface and T a reduced\nMNC divisor in Y . Let Y = Y \\ T . Suppose that the pair (Y , T ) is not\nalmost minimal. Let (Y \u2032 , T \u2032 ) be an almost minimal model of (Y , T ).\n(a) Y \u2032 is obtained from Y by a sequence of birational morphisms\n\u2032\npi : Y i \u2192 Y i+1 , Y = Y 0 \u2192 Y 1 \u2192 * * * \u2192 Y l = Y . Let Ti =\n(pi\u22121 )\u2217 (Ti\u22121 ), T0 = T, T \u2032 = Tl . Let Yi = Y i \\ Ti . For every i\nthere exists a (\u22121)-curve Ci * Ti such that pi : Y i \u2192 Y i+1 is\nthe contraction of all smoothly contractible components of Ci +\nTi without losing the normal crossing condition (which we call\nthe NC-minimalization). Finally, for the almost minimal model\n\u2032\n(Y , T \u2032), the negative part (KY \u2032 + T \u2032 )\u2212 coincides with the bark\nBk (T \u2032 ). The contractions in this process involve only curves\n(or their images) contained in the negative part of (KY + T )\u2212 ,\nand l is the number of such curves that meet Y .\n(b) We put\ne(Yi , Ti ) = \u03c7(Yi \\ Ti ) + #{connected components of Ti }.\nWe point out that here Ti is the direct image of Ti\u22121 in the sense of\ndivisors. In particular, an isolated point in pi\u22121 (Ti\u22121 ) becomes part of\nYi . We find by an elementary calculation\nLemma 1.12.\n(a) \u03c7(Yi+1 ) = \u03c7(Yi ) \u2212 1 if and only if either (Ci *\nTi ) = 1 and Ti + Ci does not contract to a smooth point or\n(Ci * Ti ) = 0.\n\u03c7(Yi+1 ) = \u03c7(Yi ) (resp. \u03c7(Yi+1 ) = \u03c7(Yi ) + 1) if and only if either\n(Ci * Ti ) = 1 and Ti + Ci contracts to a smooth point or Ci\n(1)\n(2)\nmeets exactly two connected components Ti and Ti of Ti and\n(1)\n(2)\nTi + Ci + Ti does not contract (resp. does contract) to a\nsmooth point.\n\u2032\n(b) e(Y , T \u2032 ) = e(Y , T ) \u2212 l.\nAs to (b), each Ci contracted in the above process meets T , or its\nimage, transversally in at most 2 points. One easily checks that the\nquantity e(\u2212, \u2212) decreases by 1 in such a contraction.\nThe following result will be used later.\nLemma 1.13. There is no affine, normal, rational surface Z \u2032 which\nsatisfies the following conditions:\n\n\f8\n\nR.V. GURJAR, M. KORAS*, M. MIYANISHI** AND P. RUSSELL***\n\n(a) \u03ba(Z \u2032 \\ Sing Z \u2032 ) = 0 or 1.\n(b) Z \u2032 is a Z-homology plane.\n(c) Sing Z \u2032 consists of two points, each of type A1 .\nProof. Suppose Z \u2032 exists. Let Z \u2192 Z \u2032 be a resolution of singularities\nand let E = E1 + E2 be the exceptional locus. E1 , E2 are (\u22122)-curves.\nLet p1 , p2 be the singular points of Z \u2032 . Let Z0 := Z \u2032 \\ Sing Z \u2032 .\nClaim . There is no C\u2217 -fibration on Z0 .\nSuppose that such a C\u2217 -fibration exists, say f : Z0 \u2192 B, where B\nis a smooth curve. If f extends to a C\u2217 -fibration on Z \u2032 then by [MS,\nTheorem 2.17] Z \u2032 has at most one singular point. Hence f is not defined\nat one of the points pi . By elimination of indeterminacies we see that a\nresolution of singularities of Z \u2032 has \u03ba = \u2212\u221e. Since p1 , p2 are rational\ndouble points we deduce from this that \u03ba(Z \u2032 \\ Sing Z \u2032 ) = \u03ba(Z \u2032 ) = \u2212\u221e,\na contradiction. This proves the claim.\nBy Kawamata's theorem (see [Mi, Theorem 6.1.5])for open surfaces\nwith \u03ba = 1, it follows that \u03ba(Z0 ) = 0. By standard topological argument Pic (Z0 ) is torsion (see [KR, Proposition 2.6, (iii)]). It follows that Z0 is relatively minimal (see 4.2 in [KR].) Let Z \u2282 Z be\na smooth compactification of Z such that T = Z \\ Z is an MNCdivisor. Fujita classified connected components of boundary divisors\nof an almost-minimal surface of Kodaira dimension 0 in [F, \u00a78.8]. We\nhave d(T ) = \u2212d(E) = \u22124 by the same argument as in Lemma 1.10. By\nexamining all possibilities for T we come to a contradiction. Details are\nin section 4 of [KR] (the assumptions in [KR] are bit different, but the\narguments used in section 4 work in the present situation, a lot of cases\nconsidered in [KR] in fact are ruled out by condition d(T ) = \u22124). \u0003\nThe following result shows that the conclusion of Theorem 1 holds\nif we assume that Sing S \u2032 consists of a unique quotient singular point\nand \u03ba(S \u2032 \\ Sing S \u2032 ) \u2265 0.\nLemma 1.14. Suppose that U \u2032 is an affine, normal Z-homology plane\nwith exactly one quotient singular point q which is non-cyclic. If \u03ba(U \u2032 \\\n{q}) \u2265 0 then \u03ba(U \u2032 \\ {q}) = 2 .\nProof. Suppose that \u03ba(U \u2032 \\ {q}) < 2. As in the proof of Lemma 1.13\nabove, U \u2032 \\ {q} is not C\u2217 -ruled. Hence \u03ba(U \u2032 \\ {q}) = 0. This case\nis ruled out in [KR], section 4. (In [KR] it is assumed that surfaces\nunder consideration are topologically contractible. But in section 4 it\nis enough to assume that they are Z-homology planes.)\n\u0003\n\n\fSINGULARITIES OF A HOMOLOGY PLANE OF GENERAL TYPE\n\n9\n\nLemma 1.15. Suppose that Z \u2032 is a Q-homology plane with only quotient singularities. Then Z \u2032 is affine. Moreover, if H1 (Z \u2032 ; Z) = 0 then\nZ \u2032 is a homology plane.\nProof. For the affiness of Z \u2032 we refer to [F, Theorem 2.4]. The proof\ngiven there in the smooth case can be easily extented to our setup with\nquotient singularities. If Z \u2032 is affine, then H2 (Z \u2032 ; Z) is a free abelian\ngroup. Hence it vanishes if b2 (Z \u2032 ) = 0. So Z \u2032 is a homology plane in\nthis case.\n\u0003\nLet G be a non-cyclic small finite subgroup of GL(2, C). The surface\n(C2 \\ {0})/G has the structure of a Platonic fibration and its MNC\nboundary divisor consists of two forks, P0 and P1 , say. One, P0 say, is\nthe resolution of the origin in C2 /G and contractible. We will call P1\nthe complementary fork of P0 . The possibilities for the forks P0 and\ntheir complementary forks are well known and a complete list is given\nin [Mi, Chapter 3, section 2.5]. If the fork T has has branches T1 , T2 , T3\nwe say that it is of type (d(T1 ), d(T2 ), d(T3 )). For a contractible fork or\na complementary fork we have d(Ti ) \u2265 2 and\n1\n1\n1\n+\n+\n>1\nd(T1 ) d(T2 ) d(T3 )\n.\nWe will later need the following geometric characterization of this\nsituation by Miyanishi and Tsunoda [Mi, 5.1 and Theorem 5.1.2]\nLemma 1.16. Let X be a smoth projective surface and (X, P ) be an\nalmost minimal pair. Put X \u2032 = X \\ P . If \u03ba(X \u2032 ) = \u2212\u221e and if X \u2032 is\nnot affine ruled, then one of the following occurs.\n(a) All connected components of P are contractible.\n(b) P has two connected components, P0 and P1 . One, P0 say, is a\ncontractible fork, and the other, P1 , is the complementary fork\nof P0 , X \u2032 has the structure of a Platonic fibration and \u03c7(X \u2032 ) =\n0. If X \u2032\u2032 is the surface obtained from X \\ P1 by contracting P0\nto a quotient singular point p, then X \u2032\u2032 \u2243 C2 /G where G is the\nlocal fundamental group at p.\nThroughout this article, we use the following terminology and notation concerning a maximal twig T of a divisor Q. Let T1 (resp. Tk )\ndenote the component of T that meets a branching component (resp.\nis a tip) of Q. If n = d(T ), we write n = d(T ) = d(T \u2212 T1 ) and n\ne=\ne\nd(T ) = d(T \u2212Tk ). n/n = d(T \u2212T1 )/d(T ) (resp. n\ne/n = d(T \u2212Tk )/d(T ))\n\n\f10\n\nR.V. GURJAR, M. KORAS*, M.

Determination of the dual graph of D\nWe keep the notation of Theorem 1 and Lemma 1.7. We assume that\nwe have a counterexample to Theorem 1, i.e., that q is a non-cyclic\nquotient singularity, and will eventually arrive at a contradiction. We\nassume that the number of irreducible components of the boundary\nD is minimal for such a counterexample. We record some facts and\nestablish some notation.\nSetup 2.1.\n(a) E is a fork.\n(b) Let D0 be a branching component of D. Let D \u2212 D0 = Z1 +\n* * * + Zr be the decomposition into connected components, where\n(1)\nr \u2265 3. Let Zi denote the irreducible component of Zi which\nmeets D0 . It is possible that D \u2212D0 is not MNC. Let f : S \u2192 Y\nbe a sequence of blowing downs of (-1)-curves to make the image\nof D \u2212 D0 an MNC divisor. Let Qi = f\u2217 (Zi ) (1 \u2264 i \u2264 r),\nQ0 = f\u2217 (E) and Q = Q0 + (Q1 + * * * + Qr ), If Qi contracts to a\nquotient singular point qi , we let Gi denote the local fundamental\ngroup at qi . Let Y = Y \\ Q.\n(c) Assume that no Zi contracts to a smooth point.Then we have\n\u03c7(Y ) = 2 \u2212 r\n\nand rank Pic (Y ) = #Q + 1.\n\nHere and later we denote by #Z the number of irreducible components of a (reduced, effective) divisor Z. Note that by Corollary 1.4\nthe boundary divisor D is not a linear chain. So D has a branching\ncomponent D0 .\nFurthermore, the (\u22121) curves on S contracted in the NC-minimal(1)\nization f are among the components Zi . The assumption in (c) is not\nautomatic. When it is satisfied, Y is seen to be the union of S \u2032 \\ Sing S \u2032\nand the component D0 punctured in r points. This yields \u03c7(Y ). For\nrank Pic (Y ), see [KR, 2.6, (iii)].\nWe will need the following technical result which plays an important\nrole in the sequel.\nLemma 2.2. Let Y be a smooth projective rational surface, let Q be an\nMNC-divisor consisting of smooth rational curves and let Y = Y \\ Q.\nAssume that one of the following two cases takes place.\n(i) The divisor Q consists of r + 1 connected components, Q =\nQ0 + Q1 + * * * + Qr , where Q0 is a contractible fork and r \u2265 3.\n\n\fSINGULARITIES OF A HOMOLOGY PLANE OF GENERAL TYPE\n\n11\n\nFurther, \u03c7(Y ) = 2 \u2212 r, rank Pic Y = #Q + 1 and H1 (Y \\ (Q1 \u222a\n* * * \u222a Qr ); Z) = 0.\n(ii) The divisor Q consists of r connected components, Q = Q1 +\n* * *+Qr , where r \u2265 3. Further, \u03c7(Y ) = 2\u2212r and rankPic(Y ) =\n#Q.\nAssume furthermore that the following conditions are satisfied in each\nof the above two cases.\n(1) \u03ba(Y ) \u2265 0.\n(2) If a (\u22121)-curve C contained in Supp (KY + Q)\u2212 meets two\nconnected components Qi and Qj , then Qi + C + Qj does not\ncontract to a smooth point, where (KY + Q)\u2212 is the negative\npart in the Zariski-Fujita decomposition of KY + Q.\n(3) The irreducible components of Q are independent in Pic (Y ).\n(4) No Qi contracts to a smooth point.\nThen the pair (Y , Q) is almost minimal.\n\u2032\n\nProof. Suppose that (Y , Q) is not almost minimal. Let (Y , Q\u2032 ) be\nan almost minimal model of (Y , Q). Let (pi )1\u2264i\u2264l be a sequence of\nbirational morphisms as in 1.11. We claim that \u03c7(Yi+1 ) \u2264 \u03c7(Yi ). If it\nis not the case, then by 1.12 there exists a (\u22121)-curve C on Yi meeting\nexactly two connected components of the image of the boundary Q\non Yi such that C together with these two components contracts to a\nsmooth point. Then we find curves C\u03031 , . . . , C\u0303i on Y , the pre-images\nof C1 , . . . , Ci , and we split Q = Q(1) + Q(2) , each Q(i) a sum of some\nQj , such that C\u03031 + . . . + C\u0303i + Q(1) contracts to a smooth point and\nC\u03031 + . . . + C\u0303i + Q(1) and Q(2) are disjoint. Then the intersection matrix\nof Q(1) + C\u03031 +* * *+ C\u0303i is negative definite. It follows that the irreducible\ncomponents of Q+ C\u03031 +* * *+ C\u0303i are numerically independent in Pic(Y ).\nThis implies that i = 1. However, such a (\u22121)-curve C does not exist\nby assumption (2) since C \u2282 (KY + Q)\u2212 . Thus\n(2.1)\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03c7(Y \\ Q\u2032 ) \u2264 \u03c7(Y ).\n\nLabel as Q\u20321 , . . .

MIYANISHI** AND P. RUSSELL***\n\u2032\n\nWe have #Q\u2032 \u2265 Pic (Y ) since some (\u22121)-curve C 6\u2282 Q is contracted\n\u2032\nto obtain the almost minimal model (Y , Q\u2032 ). Hence not all connected\ncomponents of Q\u2032 contract to quotient singularities, i.e., the number of\nconnected components of Q\u2032 is strictly greater than k. Since e(Y , Q) =\n2 \u2212 r + r + 1 = 3 in case (i) and e(Y , Q) = 2 in case (ii) and since l \u2265 1,\nwe have (see 1.11 and 1.12)\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nk \u2264 e(Y , Q\u2032 ) \u2212 \u03c7(Y \\ Q\u2032 ) \u2212 1\n(2.3)\n\n\u2032\n\n= e(Y , Q) \u2212 l \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03c7(Y \\ Q\u2032 )\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2264 3 \u2212 l \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03c7(Y \\ Q\u2032 ) \u2264 1 \u2212 \u03c7(Y \\ Q\u2032 ).\n\u2032\n\nHence we obtain \u03c7(Y \\Q\u2032 ) \u2264 1\u2212k. From (2.2), since |Gi | \u2265 2, we have\n\u2032\n1 \u2212 k + k2 \u2265 0. This implies k \u2264 2. Since \u03c7(Y \\ Q\u2032 ) \u2264 \u03c7(Y ) \u2264 \u22121, (2.2)\n\u2032\nimplies that k = 2 and \u03c7(Y \u2032 \\ Q\u2032 ) \u2265 \u22121. Hence \u03c7(Y \\ Q) = \u03c7(Y ) = \u22121\nand r = 3. Also |G\u20321 | = |G\u20322 | = 2. It follows that \u03ba(Y \u2032 \\ Q\u2032 ) = 0 or\n1, for otherwise we have a strict inequality in (2.2). Meanwhile, (2.3)\ngives l = 1 and e(Y , Q) = 3. This implies that we are in the case (i)\n\u2032\nand the morphism Y \u2192 Y consists of the contraction p1 of a single\n(\u22121)-curve C1 . Since Q0 is a contractible fork and |G\u20321 | = |G\u20322 | = 2, Q0\nmust be touched under p1 , i.e. C1 meets Q0 . Either C1 meets only Q0\nand Q0 + C1 contracts to a smooth point, or C1 meets Q0 and Q1 , say\nand C1 + Q0 + Q1 contracts to a (\u22122)-curve Q\u20321 . In both cases, there\nremains a non-contractible connected component Q\u20323 in Q\u2032 , where one\ncan identify Q3 with Q\u20323 because Q3 is untouched by p. In the former\n(resp. the latter) case, we may assume that Q\u20321 , Q\u20322 are (\u22122)-curves\n(resp. Q\u20322 is a (\u22122)-curve). Consider the surface Z = Y \u2032 \\ Q\u20323 . Let\nZ \u2032 be obtained from Z by contracting Q\u20321 , Q\u20322 to singular points. Since\nY \\ (Q1 \u222a Q2 \u222a Q3 ) \u2282 Y \\ Q3 and H1 (Y \\ (Q1 \u222a Q2 \u222a Q3 ); Z) = 0, we have\nH1 (Y \\ Q3 ; Z) = 0. Since the surface Z is obtained from Y \\ Q3 by a\nsequence of blowings-down, we have H1 (Z; Z) = 0 and also H1 (Z \u2032 ; Z) =\n\u2032\n0. On the other hand, Pic (Y ) \u2297 Q is freely generated by irreducible\ncomponents of Q\u2032 . In fact, the components of Q0 + C1 + Q1 + Q2 are\ncontracted to points and hence numerically independent. Since Q3 is\ndisjoint from Q0 +C1 +Q1 +Q2 , the components of Q3 are independent.\nSince rank Pic (Y ) = #Q + 1, the irreducible components of Q + C1\n\u2032\nform a Q-basis of Pic (Y ) \u2297 Q. Hence Pic (Y ) \u2297 Q is freely generated\nby the components of Q\u2032 and Pic (Z \u2032 ) \u2297 Q = 0. This implies, together\nwith H1 (Z \u2032 ; Z) = 0, that Pic (Z \u2032 ) = 0. It follows that b2 (Z \u2032 ) = 0. We\nhave\n\u03c7(Z \u2032 ) = \u03c7(Z \\ (Q\u20320 \u222a Q\u20321 )) + 2 = \u03c7(Y \u2032 \\ Q\u2032 ) + 2 = \u22121 + 2 = 1.\n\n\fSINGULARITIES OF A HOMOLOGY PLANE OF GENERAL TYPE\n\n13\n\nThus b3 (Z \u2032 ) = 0, while b4 (Z \u2032 ) = 0 because Z \u2032 is not compact. Hence\nZ \u2032 is Q-acyclic. By Lemma 1.15, Z \u2032 is affine, whence H2 (Z \u2032 ; Z) is a free\ngroup and H2 (Z \u2032 ; Z) = 0 because H2 (Z \u2032 ; Q) = 0. Thus Z \u2032 is Z-acyclic.\nNow we reach a contradiction by Lemma 1.13.\n\u0003\nIf the condition (2) in Lemma 2.2 is violated, it reflects upon the\nshape of the divisor Q on the surface Y .\nLemma 2.3. Let the situation be as in 2.1. Suppose that \u03ba(Y ) \u2265 0 and\nthat a (\u22121)-curve C \u2282 (KY + Q)\u2212 meets two connected components,\nsay Qi0 and Qi1 , of Q, so that Qi0 + C + Qi1 contracts to a smooth\npoint. Then we have\n(1) r = 3.\n(2) C meets E. After relabelling the connected components of Q,\nwe have Qi0 = E and Qi1 = Q1 .\n(3) Q1 is a contractible chain and Q2 , Q3 are trees with unimodular\nintersection matrix. None of Q2 , Q3 is a chain. One of Q2 , Q3\nis non-contractible.\n\u2032\n\nProof. Let \u03c0 : Y \u2192 Y be the contraction of Qi0 + C + Qi1 to a smooth\npoint. We infer as in the proof of Lemma 2.2 that the irreducible\ncomponents of Q + C are independent in Pic (Y ). Let Q\u2032 = \u03c0\u2217 (Q) and\n\u2032\n\u2032\nY \u2032 = Y \\ Q\u2032 . We write \u03c0(Qi ) = Qi for i 6= i0 , i1 . Now rank Pic (Y ) =\n#Q\u2032 and \u03c7(Y \u2032 ) = 3 \u2212 r.\nSuppose that r \u2265 4. Then \u03c7(Y \u2032 ) \u2264 \u22121. Suppose that there exists\na (\u22121)-curve C \u2032 which meets precisely two connected components of\nQ\u2032 , say Qj1 and Qj2 , and that Qj1 + C \u2032 + Qj2 contracts to a smooth\npoint. Again the irreducible components of Q\u2032 + C \u2032 are independent in\n\u2032\n\u2032\nPic (Y ). This is a contradiction since rank Pic (Y ) = #Q\u2032 . Note that\n\u03c7(Y \u2032 ) = 3 \u2212 r = 2 \u2212 (1 + r \u2212 2) since r \u2212 1 connected components of\n\u2032\nQ survive in Q\u2032 . So, (Y , Q\u2032 ) satisfies the assumptions of Lemma 2.2,\ncase (ii), and hence is almost minimal.\nLet k be the number of connected components of Q\u2032 which contract to\nquotient singularities. We have k < (number of connected components\nof Q\u2032 ) since otherwise we have a contradiction to the Hodge Index\nTheorem. So k < r \u2212 1, i.e. k \u2264 r \u2212 2. Now the BMY inequality gives\nk\n+ \u03c7(Y \u2032 ) \u2265 0 .\n(2.4)\n2\nr\u22122\nThis implies 2 + 3 \u2212 r \u2265 0, hence r \u2264 4. So, r = 4, k = 2 for two\n\u2032\nsingular points of type A1 and \u03ba(Y \\ Q\u2032 ) < 2 since equality occurs in\n(2.4). Now Q\u2032 has 3 connected components, two of which are (\u22122)curves. It follows that E = Q0 must be contracted together with C\n\n\f14\n\nR.V. GURJAR, M. KORAS*, M. MIYANISHI** AND P. RUSSELL***\n\nand Q1 , say. We may assume that Q2 , Q3 are (-2)-curves. Consider\n\u2032\nthe surface V \u2032 which is obtained from Y \\ Q4 by contracting Q2 , Q3\nto singular points of type A1 . Note that H1 (Y \\ Q4 ; Z) = 0 because\nY \\ Q4 contains S = Y \\ (Q1 \u222a * * * \u222a Q4 ). Then we have H1 (V \u2032 ; Z) = 0\nsince V \u2032 is obtained from Y \\ Q4 by a proper birational morphism.\nSince Pic (V \u2032 ) \u2297 Q = 0 and H1 (V \u2032 ; Z) = 0, it follows that Pic (V \u2032 ) = 0\nand hence H 2 (V \u2032 ; Z) = 0. An easy calculation gives \u03c7(V \u2032 ) = 1, hence\nb3 (V \u2032 ) = 0. Thus V \u2032 is Q-acyclic. By Lemma 1.15, V \u2032 is affine Zacyclic. Since \u03ba(V \u2032 ) = 0 or 1 we obtain a contradiction by Lemma\n1.13.\nHence r = 3. Suppose that E * C = 1 and C * Q1 = 1, where\nQ1 6= Q0 = E. Consider the surface W = Y \\ (Q2 \u222a Q3 ), which is\nthe image of S \\ (Z2 \u222a Z3 ) under a proper birational morphism. Since\nS \\ (Z2 \u222a Z3 ) contains S, H1 (W ; Z) = 0. Note that Y \u2032 = \u03c0(W ). Then\nH1 (Y \u2032 ; Z) = 0. Furthermore, Pic (Y \u2032 ) \u2297 Q = 0. The reasoning in the\n\u2032\nprevious paragraph shows that Pic (Y \u2032 ) = 0. This implies that Pic (Y )\nis freely generated by the irreducible components of Q2 \u222a Q3 . It follows\nthat the intersection matrix of Qi , i = 2, 3 is unimodular. Suppose that\nQ2 is a chain. Since Q2 is unimodular and does not contract to a smooth\npoint by the assumption in 2.1, Q2 contains an irreducible component\nwith non-negative self-intersection number and hence \u03ba(Y ) = \u2212\u221e by\nthe argument following 2.1. This is a contradiction to the assumption.\nNote that since E + C + Q1 contracts to a smooth point and E is a\nfork, Q1 is necessarily a linear chain. Since the components of C +Q1 +\nQ2 + Q3 give a basis of Pic (Y ) \u2297 Q and since C + Q1 is contractible,\none of Q2 , Q3 is not contractible by the Hodge index theorem. Hence\nwe obtain the situation described in the statement.\nSuppose, still with r = 3, that C meets two components Q1 and\nQ2 other than E. Consider U = Y \\ Q3 and U \u2032 = \u03c0(U). Then\nH1 (U \u2032 ; Z) = 0 because U contains S and U \u2032 is the image of U under a\nproper birational morphism. Let U \u2032\u2032 denote U \u2032 with E contracted to a\nsingular point q. We find that U \u2032\u2032 is Q-acyclic by the same reasoning\nas above. By Lemma 1.15, it is affine and Z-acyclic. By Lemma 1.14,\n\u03ba(U \u2032\u2032 \\ {q}) = 2. Hence U \u2032\u2032 satisfies the same assumptions as S \u2032 does.\n\u2032\nHowever, Y is a smooth normal completion of the minimal resolution\nU \u2032 of U \u2032\u2032 with the boundary divisor Q3 with #Q3 < #D. This contradicts the assumption that #D is minimal for a counterexample to\nTheorem 1.\n\u0003\nLemmas 2.2 and 2.3 give the following result.\n\n\fSINGULARITIES OF A HOMOLOGY PLANE OF GENERAL TYPE\n\n15\n\nCorollary 2.4. Let things be as in 2.1. If \u03ba(Y ) \u2265 0, then either\nthe pair (Y , Q) is almost minimal, or there exists a (\u22121)-curve C in\n(KY + Q)\u2212 as in Lemma 2.3.\nDetermination of the graph of Q (or D) according to \u03ba(Y ) will begin\nwith the following result.\nLemma 2.5. Let things be as in 2.1. If Y is affine ruled, then r = 3\nand Q1 , Q2 , Q3 are linear chains.\nProof. Since Y is affine ruled, there exists a pencil \u039b = {Ft }t\u2208P1 of\nrational curves in Y such that Ft \u2229 Y contains A1 for general t \u2208 P1 .\nWe make the following observations, where we freely use Lemma 1.1.\n(a) If \u039b has a base point in Y it is unique and we call it p. We let\ne\nY \u2192 Y be the elimination of base points and let f : Ye \u2192 P1 be the\ninduced P1 -fibration. For a reduced divisor T in Y , we denote by Te its\nreduced inverse image in Ye . We may write Te = T if p \u2208\n/ T .

In the last case, Q\n(d) In the notation of Lemma 1.5 we have b2 (Q# )\u2212b2 (Ye ) = \u22121.

Hence \u03a3 = 0, i.e., any singular fiber contains exactly\none Y -component which, by (c) above, is its unique (\u22121)-component.\nIn particular, it is a multiple component in the fiber, hence it does not\ne\nmeet H.

So H \u2282 E and H must be the branching\ncomponent of E, for otherwise we have at most two singular fibers.\nTherefore there are exactly 3 singular fibers F1 , F2 , F3 and we can label\nthe twigs E1 , E2 , E3 sprouting from H so that Ei \u2282 Fi . It is clear now\nthat (Fi )red = Ei + Ci + Qi , where Ci is the unique (\u22121)-curve in Fi .\nHence every Qi is a linear chain by 1.1(f) and the lemma is proved in\nthis case.

Then FE \u2212 C has two connected\ncomponents, one is the fork E and the second one is a linear chain T .\nIn view of the structure of fibers with exactly one (\u22121)-component,\nFE contains two components of multiplicity 1, both contained in E.\nHence T consists of components of multiplicity > 1, but the 1-section\nH meets T , a contradiction.\nSuppose \u03bd = 1. Note that then p \u2208\n/ Y if there is a base point.\ne\nNow f has a fiber F\u221e contained in Qr , say, and \u03a3 = 1. If FE has a\nsingle Y # -component, we reach a contradiction as in the case \u03bd = 0.\nSo FE has two Y # -components, C1 , C2 say. If there is a singular fiber\nF0 with a unique Y -component, then this component has multiplicity\nm > 1. We can take a cyclic covering of order m of the base curve\nP1 ramified over the points f (F0 ) and \u221e and the normalization of the\nfiber product of f : Ye \u2192 P1 with this cyclic covering. We obtain an\nunramified abelian covering of Y \u222a E, which is a contradiction because\nof H1 (Y \u222a E; Z) = 0.

Let\nFE \u2212 C1 = R + T be the decomposition into connected components,\nwhere R contains a curve with multiplicity 1. Then T is a chain by\nLemma 1.1(f). Hence E \u2282 R. It follows that C2 \u2282 R, for otherwise\nFE \u2212 (C1 + C2 ) has at most 3 connected components while there are at\nleast four by (2.5). By the same reason, C2 is a branching component\nof R. It follows that the multiplicity 1 component Qr,0 is in R. The\nfiber FE can be contracted to Qr,0 . Reversing this process we regain\nthe fiber FE by a unique succession of blowings-up. We order the\nresulting exceptional components by their order of appearance. Let T\nbe the first branching component of FE with respect to this ordering of\ncomponents. There are three branches, T1 , T2 , T3 say, at T where T1 , T2\nare chains made up of the components appearing before T , including\ner .\nQr,0 , and C1 \u2282 T3 . It follows that T = C2 or that T1 +T +T2 \u2282 FE \u2229 Q\nIn either case C1 , C2 and E are in T +T3 and the multiplicities of C1 , C2\nand all components of E have the multiplicity of T as a common divisor\nm > 1. Now we take a covering of the base curve of order m ramified\nover the points f (FE ) and \u221e and the normalization of the fiber product\nof f with this cyclic covering. We obtain an unramified abelian covering\nof Y \u222a E. This gives a contradiction as above.\nThus both C1 , C2 are (\u22121)-components. It follows that each of C1 , C2\nmeets at most two connected components of Q and that each meets a\nQj in at most one point transversally. Furthermore, C1 , C2 are disjoint from each other. It is impossible to obtain a connected fiber by\nconnecting four trees by two curves satisfying these conditions.\ner is a point on H and one of C1 , C2 meets H. Say C2\nThus FE \u2229 Q\ndoes. If C2 is a (\u22121)-curve, it is a tip of FE of multiplicity 1. It cannot\nbe the only (\u22121) component of FE by what we said above about the\ncase of a unique (\u22121)-component. Hence C1 is a (\u22121)-component. If it\nis the only one, then again C2 is a tip of FE by what we said above. As a\n(\u22121)-component of FE , C1 meets at most two other components of FE .\nIt follows that the number of connected components of FE \u2212 (C1 + C2 )\nis at most two, which is a contradiction since (2.5) implies that there\nare at least 3 of them.\n(3) Suppose that H does not exist. Then there is no base point and the\ngeneral fiber is contained in Y . We have h = 0 and find 0 \u2264 \u03a3 = \u03bd \u2212 1.\nThus \u03bd = 1 and \u03a3 = 0. The fibration has one fiber F\u221e contained in\nsome Qj . In fact, F\u221e coincides with Qj supportwise since Qj is an\nMNC divisor. So actually Qj is a (0)-curve and Qj 6= E. We can\nassume j = r. If there exists a singular fiber F1 6= FE it has a unique\nY -component of multiplicity m > 1. We reach a contradiction by the\n\n\f18\n\nR.V. GURJAR, M. KORAS*, M.

But this is a contradiction\nsince these trees, at least three in number, cannot be connected in FE\nby a single (\u22121)-component.\n\u0003\nThe following result will limit the possibilities for the boundary divisor D.\nProposition 2.6. Let things be as in 2.1. Then we have one of the\nfollowing cases.\n(i) All components Q1 , * * * , Qr contract to quotient singularities.\n(ii) \u03ba(Y ) = \u2212\u221e, r = 3, there exists a (\u22121)-curve C in Y such that\nQ1 + C + Q2 contracts to a smooth point, C * (Q3 + E) = 0 and\nQ3 is the complementary fork of E.\n(iii) \u03ba(Y ) \u2265 0, r = 3, Q1 , Q2 contract to quotient singularities,\n|G1 | = |G2 | = 2, Q3 does not contract to a quotient singularity.\nThe pair (Y , Q) is almost minimal.\n(iv) r = 3, Q1 is a linear chain, none of Q2 , Q3 is a linear chain,\none is non-contractible and the intersection matrices of both\nare unimodular. Further, there exists a (\u22121)-curve C such that\nC * E = C * Q1 = 1, E + C + Q1 contracts to a smooth point\nand C * Q2 = C * Q3 = 0.\nProof. (1) Suppose that \u03ba(Y ) \u2265 0. If the pair (Y , Q) is not almost\nminimal, then by Corollary 2.4, we have the case (iv). Assume that the\npair (Y , Q) is almost minimal. Let Q0 , Q1 , . . . , Qk be all the connected\ncomponents of Q which contract to quotient singularities. Now, since\n\u03c7(Y ) = \u03c7(Y \\ Q) = 2 \u2212 r, the BMY inequality gives\nk\n\nX 1\n1\n+\n\u2265 r \u2212 2.\n|G0 | i=1 |Gi |\n\nHence 81 + k2 \u2265 r \u2212 2 because |G0 | \u2265 8. Since r \u2265 k, this implies that\nr \u2264 4. If r = 4, then k = 4 and |Gi | = 2 for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 4. So, we are in\nthe case (i). Suppose that r = 3. Then k = 1 is impossible. If k = 2,\nthen |G1 | = |G2 | = 2 and we are in the case (iii). If k = 3 then we are\nin the case (i).\n(2) Suppose that \u03ba(Y ) = \u2212\u221e. In view of Lemma 2.5, we may assume\nthat Y is not affine ruled.\n\u2032\n(2.1) Suppose that (Y , Q) is not almost minimal. Let (Y , Q\u2032 ) be an\nalmost minimal model. We keep the notation of Setup 1.11 with T = Q\nand Ti = Q(i) , the image of Q on Y i . We are now in the situation of\nLemma 1.16 with (X, P ) = (Y \u2032 , Q\u2032 ).\n\n\fSINGULARITIES OF A HOMOLOGY PLANE OF GENERAL TYPE\n\n19\n\nSuppose that \u03c7(Y \u2032 ) \u2264 \u03c7(Y ). In case (b), \u03c7(Y \u2032 ) = 0. Since \u03c7(Y ) =\n2 \u2212 r < 0, case (a) of Lemma 1.16 occurs. Hence the intersection\nmatrix of Q\u2032 is negative definite and the irreducible components of Q\u2032\n\u2032\nare independent in Pic (Y ). On the other hand, since at least one\n\u2032\nblowing down is involved in passing from (Y , Q) to (Y , Q\u2032 ), we have\n\u2032\nrankPic(Y ) \u2264 #Q\u2032 . This a contradiction to the Hodge Index Theorem.\nSo \u03c7(Y \u2032 ) > \u03c7(Y ). As in the first part of the proof of Lemma 2.2, we\nfind a (\u22121)-curve C0 such that C0 meets two components of Q, say Qi0\nand Qi1 , and that Qi0 + C0 + Qi1 contracts to a smooth point. Again\nthe irreducible components of Q + C0 are independent in Pic (Y ) and\nhence they form a basis of Pic (Y ) \u2297 Q. It follows that the irreducible\n\u2032\ncomponents of Q(1) form a basis of Pic (Y 1 ) \u2297 Q and hence for i \u2265 1\nnot all connected components of Q(i) contract to quotient singularities.\nHence we are in case (b) of Lemma 1.16. For i \u2265 1, the curve Ci will\nnot have the property that it meets two connected components of Q(i)\nand together with these contracts to a smooth point. For otherwise,\nthe irreducible components of Q(i) +Ci are independent in Pic(Y i ), but\nrankPic(Y i ) \u2264 #Q(i) . Hence 0 = \u03c7(Y \u2032 ) \u2264 \u03c7(Y1 ) = \u03c7(Y )+1 by Lemma\n1.12. It follows that \u03c7(Y ) = \u22121, i.e. r = 3, Q = Q0 + Q1 + Q2 + Q3 .\nQ(1) has two connected components and \u03c7(Y1 ) = 0. Hence no further\ncontraction is possible, i.e. Y1 = Y \u2032 .\nSuppose that E 6= Qi0 and E 6= Qi1 . We may assume that i0 =\n1, i1 = 2. In the notation of Lemma 1.16 we have P = Q(1) = E + Q3\nwith E contractible. Hence Q3 is the complementary fork of E and\nwe have the case (ii). (If Y1\u2032 denotes Y 1 \\ Q3 with E contracted to a\nquotient singularity, then Y1\u2032 \u2243 C2 /G.)\nSuppose that E = Qi0 . We may assume that Qi1 = Q1 . In the\nnotation of Lemma 1.16 we have P = Q(1) = Q2 + Q3 where we can assume Q2 contractible and Q3 is the complementary fork of Q3 . In fact,\nwe may assume that Q3 is not contractible. Then Q2 is contractible\nsince Y \u2032 = Y1 is a Platonic fiber space. Let Y1\u2032\u2032 denote Y 1 \\ Q3 with\nQ2 contracted to a quotient singularity p with local fundamental group\nG. Then Y1\u2032\u2032 is isomorphic to C2 /G. Since H1 (Y \u222a E; Z) = 0 implies\nH1 (Y \u222a E \u222a Q1 ; Z) = 0 and since Y1\u2032\u2032 \\ {p} is the image of Y \u222a E \u222a Q1\nunder a proper birational morphism, we have H1 (Y1\u2032\u2032 \\ {p}; Z) = 0. It\nfollows that G is the binary icosahedral group, i.e., Q2 is the (\u22122)-fork\nof type (2,3,5) (cf. [B, Satz 2.11]) and Q3 is the complementary fork of\nQ2 , and both are unimodular. Since C1 meets a fork E and a connected\ncomponent Q1 of (K + Q)\u2212 , the theory of peeling implies that Q1 is a\nlinear chain. So, we have the case (iv).\n\n\f20\n\nR.V. GURJAR, M. KORAS*, M.

Then H1 (S0 ; Q) = H2 (S0 ; Q) = 0\n(cf. [KR, Proposition 2.6]). Hence eb1 (S0 ) = bb2 (S0 ) = 0. We shall\nconsider a branching component of D with precisely three branches.\nThe following result, restricting the self-intersection number of such a\ncomponent, will be used in proving Lemma 2.10 below.\nLemma 2.7. The following assertions hold.\n(i) There is no branching component B in D such that B has precisely three branches in D and B 2 \u2265 0.\n(ii) There is no branching component B in D such that B has precisely three branches in D, B 2 = \u22121 and two of the three\nbranches consist of single (\u22122)-curves.\nProof. (i) Suppose on the contrary that B is such a branching component with branches T1 , T2 , T3 . Let Hi be the component of Ti meeting\nB and write Ti = Hi + Ti\u2032 . By blowing up if necessary the point of\nintersection of B with (the inverse image of) T1 we may assume that\nB 2 = 0. Here we temporarily allow the case H12 = \u22121 and by abuse\nof notation still write D, S, * * * for the corresponding quantities after\nthe blowings-up. We apply Lemma 1.5 to D + E and the P1 -fibration\nf : S \u2192 P1 induced by B. We have h = 3 (the three components Hi\nare 1-sections of f and the only horizontal curves in D) and \u03bd = 1 since\nclearly B is the unique fiber contained in D. By the above remark on\neb1 , bb2 , we have \u03a3 = 2. Let FE be the fiber containing E. We make the\nfollowing\nClaim. FE is the only singular fiber of the fibration f .\n\nIf we admit the claim, then S \\FE \u2243 C\u2217 \u00d7C\u2217\u2217 , which implies \u03ba(S0 ) \u2264\n1, in contradiction to our standing assumption that \u03ba(S \u2032 \\ {q}) = 2.\nSo it remains to prove the claim.\nProof of the Claim. Let L be a component of a singular fiber F and\ndenote by \u03bc its multiplicity in F . We extract the following assertions\nfrom Lemma 1.1 and Lemma 1.8 for easy reference.\n(a) If L2 = \u22121, then L meets at most two other components of F\nand precisely one if \u03bc = 1.\n(b) If L is the unique (\u22121)-component in F , then \u03bc \u2265 2. Moreover,\nF has precisely two components of multiplicity 1.\n\n\fSINGULARITIES OF A HOMOLOGY PLANE OF GENERAL TYPE\n\n21\n\n(c) If L is an S0 -component of F , then L * E \u2264 1 and L * D =\n\u03a33i=1 L * Ti \u2265 2. Moreover, L * Ti \u2264 1, i = 1, 2, 3.\nSuppose C is a (\u22121)-component of F \u2229 D. Then C is not one of the\nexceptional curves in the blow-up process. So there are two possibilities. First, no blow-up takes place on C. Then C is branching in D,\nbut non-branching in F by (a), and hence meets one of the sections Hi\nand at least two other components of F \u2229 D. This is ruled out by (a).\nSecond, a single blow-up occurs on C. Then C is a (0)-curve in the\noriginal D and meets an end component of the exceptional locus which\nis a linear chain or C meets a 1-section of f . By (a) this implies that\nC is non-branching in the original D and defines a C- or C\u2217 -ruling of\nS0 . This contradicts the assumption \u03ba(S \u2032 \\ {q}) = 2. Hence F \u2229 D has\nno (\u22121)-components.\nSuppose that L is the only S0 -component in F . Then L is the only\n(\u22121)-component and we have \u03bc \u2265 2 by (b). Hence L does not meet\nany of the 1-sections Hi . On the other hand, F meets each Hi and it\nfollows that L * Ti\u2032 = 1, i = 1, 2, 3 and we have a contradiction to (a).\nIn particular FE has at least two S0 -components. Suppose there are\nprecisely two, L1 , L2 say. If L1 is the only (-1)-component in FE , then\n\u03bc \u2265 2 and by 1.8 we find that L1 * Ti\u2032 = 1 for two of the Ti\u2032 , say for\nT1\u2032 , T2\u2032 , and that L1 * E = L1 * T3 = 0. Then T1\u2032 , T2\u2032 are part of FE and\nthe components in T1\u2032 , T2\u2032 meeting H1 , H2 have multiplicity 1 in FE . By\n(b), T3\u2032 \u2229 FE = \u2205. In fact, if T3\u2032 6= \u2205 the component meeting H3 has\nmultiplicity 1 in its fiber. Since FE * H3 = 1, we have L2 * H3 = 1, so\nL2 is a third component of multiplicity 1 in contradiction to (b). So\nwe have L21 = \u22121 = L22 and we may assume L1 * E = 1. If L1 \u2229 Ti\u2032 6= \u2205\nfor some i then L1 has multiplicity \u2265 2 by (a) and L1 meets at least\ntwo of the Ti\u2032 by (c), in contradiction to (a). So, L1 meets at least two\nof the Hi , say L1 * H2 = 1 = L1 * H3 . Then T2\u2032 \u2229 FE = T3\u2032 \u2229 FE = \u2205 and\nL2 meets only T1 and L2 * D = L2 * T1 = 1, a contradiction to (c).\nHence FE has at least 3 S0 -components. Since \u03a3 = 2 there are\nexactly 3 and any other singular fiber F has exactly one. By what we\nsaid above this proves the claim.\n(ii) Let Zi (i = 1, 2) be the branches at B consisting of a single (\u22122)curve. Then the linear pencil |Z1 + 2B + Z2 | induces a P1 -fibration on\nS for which the component of the third branch Z3 meeting B is a 2section. Hence S0 has a C\u2217 -fibration and \u03ba(S0 ) \u2264 1. This contradicts\nthe assumption \u03ba(S0 ) = 2.\n\u0003\nIn what follows we choose a various branching component B of D so\nthat Setup 2.1 holds with D0 = B and apply Proposition 2.6 to D \u2212 B.\n\n\f22\n\nR.V. GURJAR, M. KORAS*, M. MIYANISHI** AND P. RUSSELL***\n\nWhen D \u2212 B falls in one of the cases treated there, we often say that\nB is of type 2.6 (i) or, simply, of type (i), etc. We will write r = rB in\nSetup 2.1 when we need to indicate the dependence on B.\nFirst we mention an easy fact.\nLemma 2.8. In the situation of Proposition 2.6 (i) we have d(D) < 0.\nProof. Let I(\u2212) denote intersection matrix. Then \u2212I(D \u2212 D0 ) is positive definite since the connected components of D\u2212D0 are contractible.\nIf d(D) > 0, \u2212I(D) is positive definite by Sylvester's criterion. Hence\nI(D) is negative definite, which is impossible because D supports an\nample divisor. Hence d(D) \u2264 0. Since |d(D)| = a > 0 by Lemma 1.10,\nthis entails that d(D) < 0.\n\u0003\nLemma 2.9. Let things be as in 2.1. Suppose that all Zi are MNC.\nThen the case 2.6 (ii) does not occur.\nProof. Suppose that the case (ii) occurs. Let B be the branching component of the fork Q3 and R1 , R2 , R3 the three branches. They are contractible chains. Let D1 be the component of Q3 such that D0 * D1 = 1.\nWe assume that D1 is a component of R1 if D1 6= B. Let Q#\n3 = Q3 \u2212D1 .\nWe have\n(2.6)\n\nd(D) = d(D0 + Q1 + Q2 )d(Q3 ) \u2212 d(Q1 )d(Q2 )d(Q#\n3 ).\n\nBy Lemma 2.7, B 2 < 0 if D1 6= B. Since B is the branching component of the fork complementary to E, B 2 \u2265 \u22121. Hence B 2 = \u22121 if\nD1 6= B. We first establish\nClaim. d(D0 + Q1 + Q2 ) > 0.\nSuppose d(D0 + Q1 + Q2 ) \u2264 0 and apply Proposition 2.6 to the\nbranching component B (not D0 ). Now D0 +Q1 +Q2 is not contractible\nand hence the connected component of D \u2212 B containing D0 is not\ncontractible since it contains D0 + Q1 + Q2 . So clearly the assumptions\nof 2.1 are satisfied and B is not of type 2.6 (i). If B is of type 2.6 (iii),\nthen R2 and R3 are (\u22122)-curves, D1 6= B and |R2 + 2B + R3 | induces\na C \u2217 -fibration on S \u2032 \\ {q}, a contradiction as before. Hence B is not\nof type 2.6 (iii). Clearly, B is not of type 2.6 (iv). Hence B is of\ntype 2.6 (ii). In particular rB = 3. If D0 meets B then D \u2212 B has\n4 connected components and rB = 4. Hence D0 * B = 0. Since B is\nof type 2.6 (ii), there exists a (\u22121)-curve C \u2032 such that R2 + C \u2032 + R3\ncontracts to a smooth point and C \u2032 * (Q1 + Q2 + D0 + R1 + E) = 0.\nFurthermore, D0 +Q1 +Q2 +R1 is the complementary fork of E with D0\nas branching component. Hence D02 = \u22121 by the argument which gave\n\n\fSINGULARITIES OF A HOMOLOGY PLANE OF GENERAL TYPE\n\n23\n\nB 2 = \u22121. Also, D0 meets Q1 , Q2 in tips. Since d(Q1 + D0 + Q2 ) \u2264 0,\nQ1 + D0 + Q2 is a non-contractible chain and is obtained from a linear\nchain by blowing up over a (0)-curve contained in it. Hence there exists\na divisor F with Supp (F ) \u2282 D0 + Q1 + Q2 which induces a P1 -fibration\nof S. Then B + R2 + C \u2032 + R3 is contained in a fiber of this P1 -fibration.\nThis is a contradiction since B + R2 + C \u2032 + R3 is a loop.\nWe continue the proof. We have \u00b1d(D) = d(E) > 0 by Lemma 1.10,\nwhile d(Q3 ) = \u2212d(E) < 0 because Q3 is the complementary fork of E\non the surface obtained from S by contracting Q1 + C + Q2 to a smooth\npoint. So (2.6) can be written as\n\u2212d(Q1 )d(Q2 )d(Q#\n3 ) = d(E)(d(D0 + Q1 + Q2 ) \u00b1 1).\nSince Q1 , Q2 are contractible, d(Q1 ) > 0 and d(Q2 ) > 0. Hence the\nabove claim implies that d(Q#\n3 ) \u2264 0. It then follows that D0 * B = 0,\n#\nfor otherwise Q3 consists of three contractible chains and d(Q#\n3 ) > 0.\nSuppose that D1 * B = 1. Then\nd(Q#\n3 ) = d(B + R2 + R3 )d(R1 \u2212 D1 ) \u2264 0.\nSince R1 \u2212 D1 is either empty or a contractible chain, we have d(R1 \u2212\nD1 ) \u2265 0. Thus d(B +R2 +R3 ) \u2264 0 and B +R2 +R3 is a non-contractible\nlinear chain. As above there exists a divisor F with Supp(F ) \u2282 B+R2 +\nR3 such that |F | gives rise to a P1 -fibration on S and D0 + Q1 + Q2 + C,\nwhich is a loop, is contained in a fiber. This is a contradiction. Hence\nD1 * B = 0. Then in particular #R1 > 1. As for any contractible\nor complementary fork, one of the Ri is a single (\u22122)-curve. We may\nassume it is R2 . If the tip meeting B of R1 or of R3 is a (\u22122)-curve, N\nsay, then N + 2B + R2 induces a P1 -fibration with the loop Q1 + D0 +\nQ2 + C contained in a fiber. Hence these tips are (\u2264 \u22123)-curves. It\nfollows that Q3 is a (5, 2, 3)-fork. Moreover R1 has two components D1\nand D2 with D22 = \u22123, D12 = \u22122 and D2 meeting B, and R3 consisting\nof a single (\u22123)-curve.\nb1 = D0 +Q1 +Q2 +t R1 ,\nD\u2212B has connected components R2 , R3 and R\nwhere we write t R1 for R1 attached in reversed order to the branching\nb1 by D1 . Since D0 is the only possible (\u22121)-curve\ncomponent D0 of R\nin D \u2212 B the assumptions of 2.1 are satisfied with respect to B and\nwe can apply Proposition 2.6. We infer readily that either the case (i)\nb1 is the complementary fork of E\nor the case (ii) occurs. In case (ii), R\nand identical to the fork Q3 . Since R1 is not symmetric, this is not the\nb1 is a contractible fork. It follows\ncase. So B is of type 2.6 (i), i.e., R\nb1 is either\nfrom Lemma 2.8 that d(D) < 0 and hence d(D) = \u2212d(E). R\nof type (2, 2, 5) or (2, 3, 5). We may assume that Q1 is a (\u22122)-curve.\n\n\f24\n\nR.V. GURJAR, M. KORAS*, M. MIYANISHI** AND P. RUSSELL***\n\nThen Q2 is a (\u22122)-curve in the (2, 2, 5)-case and either a (\u22123)-curve or\na chain of two (\u22122)-curves in the (2, 3, 5)-case. We have \u2212d(D) = a =\nd(E) = \u2212d(Q3 ) = 7. Let D02 = \u2212t. Suppose that Q2 is a (\u22122)-curve.\nWe compute \u22127 = d(D) = (4t \u2212 4)d(Q3 ) \u2212 4d(Q#\n3 ) = \u2212(4t \u2212 4)7 + 12.\nSuppose that Q2 is a (\u22123)-curve. Then \u22127 = \u2212(6t \u2212 5)7 + 18. If Q2\nconsists of two (\u22122)-curves then \u22127 = \u2212(6t \u2212 7)7 + 18. In all three\ncases, t is not an integer. Hence the case 2.6 (i) is impossible.\n\u0003\nLemma 2.10. Suppose that D \u2212 D0 is of type (iii) in Proposition 2.6\nand that Z1 , Z2 are MNC. Let D1 be the component of Z3 which meets\nD0 . Then the following assertions hold.\n(1) D1 is contained in a twig of Z3 . If Z3 is MNC, then D1 is a tip\nof Z3 and D02 = D12 = \u22122. Moreover, D1 is not a maximal twig\nof Z3 .\n(2) Suppose that Z3 contains two (\u22121)-components B1 , B2 which\nmeet each other. Then Z3 is MNC, D1 , D0 are (\u22122)-curves\nand D1 * (B1 + B2 ) = 0.\nProof. Let P = (KS + D + E)+ and PY = (KY + Q)+ be respectively\nthe nef parts in the Zariski-Fujita decomposition of KS + D + E and\nKY + Q. Here we note that Q contains Q0 = E. We have\n3\n3\n1 1\n1\n3\n0 \u2264 P2 \u2264\n\u2264 , 0 \u2264 PY2 \u2264 3( + +\n\u2212 1) \u2264\n|\u0393|\n8\n2 2 |\u0393|\n8\nby the BMY inequality (not Lemma 1.6, but the original estimation\ninvolving P 2 or PY2 (cf. [Mi, Chapter 2, Theorem 6.6.2])) where we\nrecall that \u0393 is the local fundamental group of S \u2032 at the point q.

Then the Ti are\nuntouched under the process Z3 \u2192 Q3 of making Z3 an MNC divisor\nsince D1 is the only possible nonbranching (\u22121)-component in Z3 and\nis separated from any Ti by a branching component of Z3 . Note that\n(KY + Q)2 = (KS + D \u2212 D0 + E)2 since we successively contract only\n(\u22121)-components meeting exactly two other components of Z3 or its\nimage. Since (S, D + E) and (Y , Q) are almost minimal, we have\nP = KY + (D + E)# and PY = KY + Q# .

This is ruled out by Lemma 2.7 (ii).\nSuppose that Z3 is MNC. Note that then 2.1 (c) holds. We may\nassume that D1 is contained in the twig T1 of Z3 . Suppose that D1 is\nnot a tip of Z3 . Let T1\u2032 be the maximal twig of D which is contained in\nT1 . Then the maximal twigs of D are Z1 , Z2 , T1\u2032 , T2 , . . . , Tl . We have\n(2.9)\n\n(KS + D + E)2 = P 2 \u2212 1 \u2212 e(T1\u2032 ) \u2212\n\nl\nX\n\ne(Ti ) + (Bk E)2 .\n\ni=2\n\nSubtracting (2.9) from (2.8), we obtain\n\n\u22122 + D02 = PY2 \u2212 P 2 \u2212 3 + e(T1\u2032 ) \u2212 e(T1 ).\nand hence\nD02 = PY2 \u2212 P 2 \u2212 1 + e(T1\u2032 ) \u2212 e(T1 ).\nLet the common tip of T1 and T1\u2032 be a (\u2212k)-curve. Then e(T1\u2032 ) \u2265 k1 and\n1\n(since T1 has at least two components) e(T1 ) < k\u22121\n.

Hence the maximal\ntwigs of D are T2 , * * * , Tl and we obtain\n\n(2.10)\n\n(KS + D + E)2 = P 2 \u2212 1 \u2212\n\nl\nX\n\ne(Ti ) + (Bk E)2\n\ni=2\n\n(2.11)\n\n(KY + Q)\n\n2\n\n=\n\nPY2\n\n\u22124\u2212\n\nl\nX\n\ne(Ti ) + (Bk E)2 .\n\ni=1\n\nSubtracting (2.10) from (2.11), we obtain\n\u22122 + D02 = PY2 \u2212 P 2 \u2212 3 \u2212 e(T1 ).\n\n\f26\n\nR.V.

Hence D02 = \u22122 in view of Lemma\n2.7. If D12 \u2264 \u22123 or if D1 is a maximal twig of Z3 , then e(T1 ) \u2264 12 and\nwe obtain D02 > \u22122 in contradiction to Lemma 2.7.\n\n(2) By (1), we can assume that D1 is contained in the maximal twig\nT1 of Z3 . Since D is MNC, no component of T1 other than D1 is a\n(\u22121)-curve and D1 is a branching component of D if D12 = \u22121.\nSuppose first that D12 = \u22121. Suppose further that D1 6= B1 , B2 . We\nconsider the P1 -fibration f defined by |B1 + B2 |. If D1 * (B1 + B2 ) = 0,\nlet F be the fiber of f containing D1 . Either all components of D\nmeeting D1 are in F , or precisely one of them meets B1 + B2 and is\na 1-section of f . Both possibilities are ruled out by Lemma 1.1 (f).\nHence D1 * (B1 + B2 ) > 0. We may assume that D1 * B1 = 1. Then B1\nis a branching component of Z3 to which the twig T1 is attached. This\nis also the case if D1 coincides with B2 .\nWe shall show that this situation leads to a contradiction. The process Z3 \u2192 Q3 of making Z3 an MNC divisor involves only contractions\nof T1 -components since the image of B1 is a curve with non-negative\nself-intersection number. Let T1\u2032 be the image of T1 . The maximal\ntwigs of Q3 different from T1\u2032 are precisely T2 , . . . , Tl . Let T0 be the\nmaximal twig of D contained in T1 . We have\n(2.12) (KS + D + E)\n\n2\n\n2\n\n= P \u2212 1 \u2212 e(T0 ) \u2212\n\nl\nX\n\ne(Ti ) + (Bk E)2\n\ni=2\n\n(2.13)\n\n(KY + Q)\n\n2\n\n=\n\nPY2\n\n\u22124\u2212\n\ne(T1\u2032 )\n\n\u2212\n\nl\nX\n\ne(Ti ) + (Bk E)2 .\n\ni=2\n\nSubtracting (2.12) from (2.13), we obtain\n\u22122 + D02 = PY2 \u2212 P 2 \u2212 3 \u2212 e(T1\u2032 ) + e(T0 ).\nIf T1 is contracted, T1\u2032 is a point and e(T1\u2032 ) = 0. Then D02 > \u22121 \u2212 P 2 ,\nwhich implies D02 \u2265 \u22121 in contradiction to Lemma 2.7. So let D3 be\nthe tip of T1 and let D32 = \u2212k. D3 is not contracted. Suppose that D3\n1\nis untouched in the minimalization. Then e(T0 ) \u2265 k1 and e(T1\u2032 ) < k\u22121\n.\n1\n3\n2\nWe obtain D0 > \u22121 \u2212 8 \u2212 k(k\u22121) > \u22122. This is again a contradiction\nby Lemma 2.7. Suppose that D3 is touched. Then T1\u2032 is a single curve\nwith self-intersection number \u2264 \u22122, whence e(T1\u2032 ) \u2264 12 . We obtain\nagain D02 \u2265 \u22121, a contradiction. So the case D12 = \u22121 is impossible.\n\n\fSINGULARITIES OF A HOMOLOGY PLANE OF GENERAL TYPE\n\n27\n\nIn particular Z3 is an MNC divisor. By (1), D1 is a tip of Z3 and\nD1 6= T1 . Clearly Bi is not contained in T1 . Hence D1 * (B1 + B2 ) = 0.\nFurther, D02 = D12 = \u22122 by (1).\n\u0003\nLemma 2.10 implies the following result.\nCorollary 2.11. Suppose that D \u2212 D0 is of type (iii) in Proposition\n2.6 and that Z1 , Z2 are (\u22122)-curves. Then Z3 does not contain two\n(\u22121)-curves which meet each other.\nProof. Suppose that two such (\u22121)-curves B1 , B2 exist. We keep the\nnotation of Lemma 2.10. Consider the P1 -fibration defined by |B1 +B2 |.\nBy (2) in Lemma 2.10, T = Z1 + Z2 + D0 + D1 is contained in a fiber\nand consists of (\u22122)-curves. Since any component C of Z3 \u2212 (B1 + B2 )\nmeeting B1 + B2 is a 1-section, C meets D0 + Z1 + Z2 + D1 , hence D1 ,\nby Lemma 2.12 below. But both B1 , B2 are branching components of\nZ3 , so there are at least four such C. On the other hand, only one can\nmeet D1 since D1 is a tip of Z3 . This is a contradiction.\n\u0003\nThe following easy remark on a singular fiber of a P1 -fibration is used\nin the proof of Corollary 2.11.\nLemma 2.12. Suppose that f : M \u2192 B is a P1 -fibration on a smooth\nprojective surface M . Suppose that T = H +L1 +L2 +L3 is a (\u22122)-fork\ncontained in a fiber FT , where H 2 = \u22122, L2i = \u22122 (i = 1, 2, 3) and H\nis a branching component. Then every 1-section of f meets T .\nProof. Let L\u2032i be the branch at H of FT containing Li . Considering\nthe process of shrinking FT to a (0)-curve we see that for precisely one\ni, say for i = 1, we have L1 6= L\u20321 and that L\u20321 shrinks to a point on\nH in such a way that H is turned into a (\u22121)-curve. It follows that\nFT = L\u20321 + H + L2 + L3 with each component of L\u20321 + H of multiplicity\nat least 2 in FT . Hence any 1-section meets L2 or L3 .\n\u0003\nThe following result will determine the shape of D when D contains\ntwo (\u22121)-curves meeting each other transversally in one point.\nLemma 2.13. Suppose that B1 , B2 are two (\u22121)-curves in D such that\nB1 * B2 = 1. Then D = B1 + B2 + T1 + T2 + U1 + U2 where Ti , Uj ,\ni, j = 1, 2 are linear chains, B1 meets T1 , T2 in tips, B2 meets U1 , U2 in\ntips. Moreover B1 + T1 + T2 and B2 + U1 + U2 are contractible (possibly\nto smooth points).\nProof. Let Z1 , . . . , Zr be the connected components of D \u2212 B1 , where\n(1)\nwe assume that B2 \u2282 Zr . Let Zi be the component of Zi meeting\n\n\f28\n\nR.V. GURJAR, M. KORAS*, M. MIYANISHI** AND P. RUSSELL***\n\nB1 . We denote by f the P1 -fibration induced by |B1 + B2 |. Our proof\nconsists of verifying several claims.\n(1)\n\nClaim 1. Zi (1 \u2264 i \u2264 r \u2212 1) is not a (\u22121)-curve. In particular,\nZ1 , . . . , Zr\u22121 are MNC divisors.\n(1)\n\nProof. Suppose that Z1 is a (\u22121)-curve. We apply Proposition 2.6\n(1)\nwith D0 = Z1 . Let R1 , . . . , Rs be the connected components of D \u2212\n(1)\n(1)\nZ1 , where we assume that B1 + B2 \u2282 Rs . Suppose that R1 is a (\u22121)(1)\n(1)\ncurve. It meets the 1-section Z1 of f . Since R1 is branching in D this\ngives a contradiction to Lemma 1.1 (e) as before. Hence R1 , . . . , Rs\u22121\nare MNC divisors. Note that Rs is not contractible since it contains\n(1)\nB1 + B2 . In particular, 2.1 (c) is satisfied with respect to D0 = Z1\n(1)\nand we can apply 2.6. By what we said, D \u2212 Z1 is not of type (i).\n(1)\nSuppose that D \u2212 Z1 is of type (iv). Then one of R1 , . . . , Rs , say R1 ,\nis a linear chain, s = 3, and there exists a (\u22121)-curve C meeting E and\nR1 so that C * R2 = C * R3 = 0. Hence E + C + R1 is contained in a fiber\n(1)\n(1)\nof f . Since Z1 is a 1-section of f and meets R1 , we have C * Z1 = 0.\nTherefore C * D = 1 and we reach a contradiction because C is then a\nsimple curve, which does not exist by Lemma 1.8. By Lemma 2.7 (ii),\n(1)\n(1)\nD \u2212 Z1 is not of type (iii). Therefore D \u2212 Z1 is of type (ii). Let\nC be as specified in Proposition 2.6 (ii). Then C connects R1 and\n(1)\nR2 , and C + R1 + R2 is in a fiber of the fibration f for which Z1 is\n(1)\na 1-section. But Z1 meets two components of the fiber, which is a\ncontradiction.\n\u0003\nClaim 2. B1 and B2 are the only (\u22121)-curves contained in D.\nProof. Suppose that B3 be a (\u22121)-curve in D different from B1 , B2 . By\nClaim 1, B3 does not meet B1 and, by symmetry, it does not meet B2 .\nHence B3 is in a fiber F of f . As a (-1)-component of D, B3 meets at\nleast three components of D. Among them, at most two are in F. Hence\none meets B1 + B2 and is a 1-section of f . This leads to a contradiction\nwith Lemma 1.1 (e).\n\u0003\nClaim 3. Zi (1 \u2264 i \u2264 r \u2212 1) is a linear chain and B1 meets the Zi in\ntheir tips.\nProof. Suppose that D0 \u2282 Z1 is a branching component of Z1 . Then it\nis a branching component of D. One of the connected components of\nD \u2212 D0 contains B1 + B2 hence is not contractible. No other connected\ncomponent is contractible to a point by Claim 2. So we can apply 2.6.\nD0 is not of type 2.6 (i). D0 is not of type 2.6 (iv) or 2.6 (ii) by the\n\n\fSINGULARITIES OF A HOMOLOGY PLANE OF GENERAL TYPE\n\n29\n\nsame argument as in the proof of Claim 1. So D0 is of type 2.6 (iii)\nand this contradicts Corollary 2.11. This proves the first assertion.\n(1)\n(1)\nNow suppose that Z1 is not a tip of Z1 . Then Z1 is branching\n(1)\nin D and as above Proposition 2.6 applies. Z1 is not of type 2.6 (i),\n2.6 (iv). It is not of type 2.6 (iii) by Corollary 2.11. Hence it is of type\n2.6 (ii). Now we argue as at the end of the proof of Claim 1.\n\u0003\nBy symmetry on B1 and B2 , all the connected components of D \u2212B2\nexcept the component B1\u2032 containing B1 are linear chains and MNC.\nSuppose r \u2265 4. Then B1\u2032 is MNC since B1 is branching and the only\n(\u22121)-component. We can therefore apply Proposition 2.6. By Lemma\n2.9, B2 is not of type 2.6 (ii). Since B1 is a branching (\u22121)-component,\nB1\u2032 is not contractible and B2 is not of type 2.6 (i). Clearly B2 is\nnot of type 2.6 (iv). Hence B2 is of type 2.6 (iii). However, this is a\ncontradiction by Lemma 2.7 (ii). So r = 3. Now we change notations.\nPut Z1 = T1 , Z2 = T2 . By symmetry, let U1 , U2 be the two twigs of D\nsprouting out of B2 . Suppose that B1 + T1 + T2 is not contractible. We\ncan then again apply Proposition 2.6 to B2 . B2 is not of type 2.6 (i) or\n2.6 (iv). It is not of type 2.6 (iii) by Lemma 2.7 (ii). It is not of type\n2.6 (ii) since none of the connected components T1 + B1 + T2 , U1 and U2\nis a fork. This is a contradiction. Hence B1 + T1 + T2 is contractible.\nBy symmetry, B2 + U1 + U2 is contractible. This completes the proof\nof Lemma 2.13.\n\u0003\nWe recall the notation P = (KS + D + E)+ = KS + (D + E)# =\nKS + D + E \u2212 Bk(D + E). Let B be a branching component of D. We\nsay that a connected component Z of D \u2212 B is P -quasi-orthogonal if\nDi *P = 0 for every irreducible component Di \u2282 Z such that Di *B = 0.\nWe make a few straightforward observations that we will use below.\nObservation 2.14. (i) If D is a fork and B its branching component,\nthen each connected component of D \u2212 B is P -quasi-orthogonal.\n(ii) Suppose D is not a fork. Let T be an irreducible component of D\nand \u03b2T its coefficient in (D + E)# .\n(a) If T is not in a maximal twig of D, then \u03b2T = 1.\n(b) If T does not meet a maximal twig of D, then T * P = T * (KS +\nD + E) = \u22122 + \u03b1T , where \u03b1T is the branching number of T . If T is\nalso non-branching, then T * P = 0.\n(c) If T is in a maximal twig T \u2032 of D, then T is in Supp(Bk(D + E))\nand T * P = 0. If T is the tip of T \u2032 meeting D \u2212 T \u2032 , then \u03b2T = 1 \u2212 d(T1 \u2032 ) .\n(d) Let B be a branching component of D and Z a connected component of D \u2212 B. Then Z is P -quasi-orthogonal if T * P = 0 for every\ncomponent T of Z that does not meet B and is branching in D.\n\n\f30\n\nR.V. GURJAR, M. KORAS*, M. MIYANISHI** AND P. RUSSELL***\n\nLemma 2.15. Assume that there are no two (\u22121)-curves in D which\nmeet each other. Suppose that B is a (\u22121)-curve in D. Then all\nconnected components of D \u2212 B are MNC divisors, contractible and\nP -quasi-orthogonal.\nProof. Let D \u2212 B = Z1 \u222a * * * \u222a Zr . Then the Zi are MNC divisors, i.e.,\n(1)\nQi = Zi , because no Zi is a (\u22121)-curve by the assumption that no\ntwo (\u22121)-curves meet each other. In particular Proposition 2.6 applies\nto any (\u22121)-curve in D.\nClaim . B is not of type 2.6 (iv).\nProof. Suppose the contrary. We assume that Z1 is the unique chain\nin D \u2212 B and that Z3 is not contractible. We will construct a sequence\nH0 , H1 , . . . of branching components of D which satisfies the following\nconditions.\n(1) H0 = B. For n > 0, H0 , . . . , Hn are contained in a connected\ncomponent of D \u2212 Hn+1 . This component is a non-contractible\nunimodular tree. In particular Hi 6= Hj for i 6= j.\n(2) Each Hi is of type 2.6 (iv).\n(3) The connected components of D \u2212 Hn are MNC divisors.\nThe construction proceeds as follows. If n > 0, let T1 , T2 , T3 be the\nconnected components of D \u2212 Hn with T1 linear and T3 containing\nH0 , . . . , Hn\u22121 . If n = 0, we put Ti = Zi . T2 , T3 are non-linear unimodular trees, T3 is non-contractible. Let H be a branching component of T2 .\nSuppose that there exists a (\u22121)-component H \u2032 of T2 which meets H.\nSince no other (\u22121)-component of D meets H \u2032, all connected components of D\u2212H \u2032 are MNC. In particular, H \u2032 is not of type (ii) by Lemma\n2.9. Since the connected component of D \u2212 H \u2032 containing Hn + T3 is\nnot contractible, H \u2032 is not of type (i). It is not of type (iii) by Lemma\n2.10. Hence H \u2032 is of type (iv), and we may put Hn+1 = H \u2032 . Suppose\nthat there is no (\u22121)-component in T2 which meets H. Since the connected component of D \u2212 H containing Hn + T3 is not contractible, no\nconnected component contracts to a smooth point and we can apply\nProposition 2.6 to H. H is not of type (i) and it follows from Proposition 2.6 that H has three branches in D. This implies that H * Hn = 0,\nfor otherwise H has four branches since it is a branching in T2 . Hence\nno (\u22121)-curve in D meets H and all connected components of D \u2212 H\nare MNC divisors. In particular, H is not of type (ii) by Lemma 2.9.\nFurthermore, H is not of type (iii), for otherwise 2 divides d(Z2 ) which\nmust be \u00b11. Hence H is of type (iv), and we may put Hn+1 = H.\nIt is clear that such a sequence cannot exist since the number of\nirreducible components of D is finite. The claim is proved.\n\u0003\n\n\fSINGULARITIES OF A HOMOLOGY PLANE OF GENERAL TYPE\n\n31\n\nB is not of type 2.6 (ii) by Lemma 2.9. It is not of type (iii) by\nLemma 2.7. Hence B is of type (i). A further (\u22121)-curve does not exist\nsince it would be branching in D \u2212 B. Suppose that Z1 is not P -quasiorthogonal. By 2.14 (d), Z1 is not a chain. Hence Z1 is a fork, and again\nby 2.14 (d) the branching component B1 of Z1 is disjoint from B. The\nconnected components of D\u2212B1 are MNC divisors since B is the unique\n(\u22121)-component of D. We can apply Proposition 2.6 with D0 = B1 .\nClearly, B1 is not of type (i) since B is a branching (\u22121)-component in\na connected component of D \u2212 B1 . Two of the connected components\nof D \u2212 B1 are also connected components of Z1 \u2212 B and hence linear\nchains. So B1 is not of type (iv). By Lemma 2.9, B1 is not of type\n(ii). Thus B1 is of type (iii). We have Z1 = B1 + Q1 + Q2 + Q3 , where\nQ1 , Q2 are (\u22122)-curves contracting to quotient singularities and Q3 is a\nlinear chain that is part of the non-contractible connected component\nof D \u2212 B1 . Now P = KS + B1 + 21 Q1 + 12 Q2 + Q\u20323 + * * * where Q\u20323 is the\ncomponent of Q3 meeting B1 . We calculate P *B1 = \u22122+1+ 21 + 12 = 0.\nBy 2.14 (d) Z1 is P -quasi-orthogonal and we have a contradiction. \u0003\nThe following result determines more precisely the shape of D.\nProposition 2.16. One of the following two cases takes place.\n(a) There exists a branching curve B in D such that all connected\ncomponents of D \u2212 B are MNC divisors, contractible and P quasi-orthogonal.\n(b) D has exactly two branching components B1 , B2 such that D =\nT1 +T2 +B1 +T +B2 +U1 +U2 , where T is a linear chain, possibly\nempty, connecting B1 and B2 , and T1 , T2 (resp. U1 , U2 ) are\nmaximal twigs of D sprouting out of B1 (resp. B2 ). Moreover,\nB1 + T1 + T2 + T and B2 + U1 + U2 + T are contractible.\nProof. Lemmas 2.13 and 2.15 give the result if there is a (\u22121)-curve in\nD. We assume therefore that D does not contain a (\u22121)-curve. Then\nall divisors D \u2032 \u2282 D are MNC. In particular we can apply Proposition\n2.6 to any branching component D0 of D. By Lemma 2.9, the case\n2.6 (ii) can never occur. These observation will be used repeatedly in\nthe proof below.\nIt is straightforward to prove by induction on #D that there exists a\nbranching curve B1 in D such that, if Z1 , . . . , Zr denote the connected\ncomponents of D\u2212B1 , Z1 , . . . , Zr\u22121 are linear chains and B1 meets them\nin tips. Hence Z1 , * * * , Zr\u22121 are maximal twigs of D and contractible\nCorollary 1.4.\nSuppose that Zr is not contractible. Then B1 is not of type 2.6 (i). If\nB1 were of type 2.6 (iv) we have r = 3 and only one of Z1 , Z2 is a linear\n\n\f32\n\nR.V. GURJAR, M. KORAS*, M. MIYANISHI** AND P. RUSSELL***\n\nchain. So this does not occur. Suppose that B1 is of type (iii), hence\nthat r = 3 and Z1 , Z2 are (\u22122)-curves. By Lemma 2.10, B1 meets a\ntip of a maximal twig R of Z3 . Since Z3 is not contractible it is not a\nlinear chain for otherwise every component of Z3 has self-intersection\nnumber \u2264 \u22122 by Corollary 1.4 and Z3 would be contractible.\nHence R sprouts from a branching component B2 of Z3 . Let R1 , . . . , Rs\nbe the connected components of D \u2212 B2 with R \u2282 R1 . Then R1 =\nB1 + Z1 + Z2 + R and we claim it is contractible. First, B12 \u2264 \u22122 by\nLemma 2.7. Next, R is a contractible linear chain by Corollary 1.4.\nHence R1 is a contractible fork of type (2, 2, m) for some m. Since R1\nis apparently not a (\u22122)-curve, B2 is not of type (iii). Further, B2 is\nnot of type (iv) since the intersection matrix of R1 is not unimodular\nas the determinant is divisible by 2. So B2 is of type (i), i.e., Ri is\ncontractible for i = 1, . . . , s.\nNow R1 is P -quasi-orthogonal. In fact, by 2.14 (d), we have to check\nonly B1 * P = 0, and this is done as it was for B1 in the proof of 2.15.\nSuppose that R2 is not P -quasi-orthogonal. This implies as before that\nR2 is a fork and that B3 * B2 = 0, where B3 is the branching component\nof R2 . The connected component U of D \u2212 B3 containing B2 is not\ncontractible since B1 and B2 are two branching components in it. Hence\nB3 is not of type (i). Furthermore, the connected component U has two\ntwigs consisting of single (\u22122)-curves, hence the intersection matrix of\nU is not unimodular as the determinant is divisible by 2. Hence B3\nis not of type (iv) as U is not a linear chain. B3 is not of type (iii)\nfor otherwise we see that R2 is P -quasi-orthogonal as before. The case\nof type (ii) does not occur with B3 by the remark at the beginning\nof the proof. So, we are led to a contradiction. Hence R2 must be\nP -quasiorthogonal, and similarly Ri , i \u2265 2. So we have the case (a)\nwith B = B2 .\nWe may assume then that Zr is contractible. If Zr is P -quasiorthogonal, we are done. Suppose that Zr is not P -quasi-orthogonal.\nThen again Zr is not a linear chain, hence a fork, and the branching\ncomponent B2 of Zr is disjoint from B1 . Let R1 , R2 , R3 be the maximal\ntwigs of Z3 , where we assume that R1 meets B1 . Let D1 be the component of R1 such that D1 * B1 = 1. Let R1\u2032 = B1 + Z1 + * * * + Zr\u22121 + R1 .\nThen R1\u2032 , R2 , R3 are the connected components of D \u2212 B2 . Suppose\nthat r > 3 or D1 is not a tip of R1 . Then R1\u2032 is not contractible, hence\nB2 is not of type (i). B2 is not of type (iii), for otherwise Zr is P -quasiorthogonal. So, B2 is of type (iv), but two of the connected components\nof D \u2212 B2 are linear chains, a contradiction. So, r = 3 and D1 is a tip\nof R1 . Suppose further that R1\u2032 = B1 + Z1 + Z2 + R1 is not contractible.\n\n\fSINGULARITIES OF A HOMOLOGY PLANE OF GENERAL TYPE\n\n33\n\nThen B2 is not of type (i). It is not of type (iii), for otherwise Z3 is\nP -quasi-orthogonal. Hence B2 is of type (iv), but R2 , R3 are chains, a\ncontradiction. Thus B1 + Z1 + Z2 + R1 is contractible. So we have the\ncase (b) with T = R1 , T1 = Z1 , T2 = Z2 , U1 = R2 , U2 = R3 .\n\u0003\nWe have a remark to add on the singular point q of S \u2032 in the case\n(a).\nLemma 2.17. In the case (a) of Proposition 2.16, KS * E > 0. This\nimplies that q is not a rational double point.\nProof. Suppose that q is a rational double point. Then KS is trivial\nwhen restricted to a small punctured neighborhood U of q. Since S \u2032\nis a Z-homology plane, it is known that the natural homomorphism\nH1 (U, Z) \u2192 H1 (S0 , Z) is an isomorphism, and hence the restriction\nmap Pic (S0 ) \u2192 Pic (U) is an isomorphism, see [KR, Proposition\n2.6 (ii)]. Hence KS is trivial when restricted to S0 and KS is supported on D + E. Since E has negative definite intersection matrix\nand Ej * KS = 0 for every component Ej of E, there actually\nP is a\ncanonical divisor KS supported by D. Write KS = a0 B +\nai Di .\nSince all the Zi are MNC divisors and contractible, we can use [GS,\nLemma 4.1] to conclude that either all aj \u2265 0 or a0 < 0 and aj \u2264 0\nfor j \u2265 1. In the first case the geometric genus pg (S) > 0. This is\na contradiction, for S \u2032 is a Z-homology plane and hence rational. In\nthe second case, if Di is the component of some Zj meeting B and\nai = 0, then Di * KS < 0, which is not the case as Di2 \u2264 \u22122. Since\nthe intersection form on Zj is negative definite, as < 0 for every component Ds of Zj . Hence aj < 0 for all j and KS + D \u2264 0. It follows\nthat \u03ba(S0 ) = \u03ba(KS + D + E) \u2264 \u03ba(E). Since E contracts to a normal point we have h0 (nE) = 1 for every n so \u03ba(E) = 0 and reach a\ncontradiction.\n\u0003\n3. Determination of the nef part P\nWe provide further details about the situation in 2.16.\nLemma 3.1. d(D) < 0 and hence a = d(E) = \u2212d(D).\nProof.

Let Z1 , . . . , Zr be the connected components of D \u2212 B. Let Ci\nbe the irreducible component of Zi which meets B.

GURJAR, M. KORAS*, M. MIYANISHI** AND P. RUSSELL***\n\n(b) D \u2212 Supp (F ) = T1 + T2 is a union of two disjoint twigs of\nD, where T1 is a single curve and T2 = T2\u2032 + T2\u2032\u2032 with a single\ncurve T2\u2032 meeting Supp (F ) and a possibly empty linear chain\nT2\u2032\u2032 which is a twig of D. Further, T1 and T2\u2032 are 2-sections of\nthe fibration.\n(c) D \u2212 Supp (F ) = U1 + U2 , where U1 is a single curve, U2 is a\npossible empty linear chain, U1 + U2 is a twig of D and U1 is a\n4-section of the fibration.\nProof. Suppose that a divisor F exists. Let FE be the fiber containing\nE. Consider first the case (b). With notation as in Lemma 1.5 (applied\nto S \\ (D \u222a E), we have \u03a3 = 1 since \u03bd = 1, h = 2 and eb1 (S0 ) = bb2 (S0 ) =\n0.\nLet C be an S0 -component C of FE . Then C * E \u2264 1 since C, E are\nboth part of the fiber FE . We have C * D > 0 since S \u2032 is affine. Since\na simple curve does not exist by Lemma 1.8, we have C * D > 1. If\nC * T2\u2032\u2032 > 0, then C, T2\u2032\u2032 are part of FE and C * T2\u2032\u2032 = 1.\nSuppose that C has multiplicity m > 1 in FE . Then C * T1 \u2264 1 and\nC * T2 \u2264 1 since T1 , T2\u2032 are 2-sections. We now conclude C * T1 = 1\nand C * T2 = 1 and m = 2. Moreover FE * T1 = C * T1 and C is the\nonly component of FE meeting T1 . If C * T2\u2032 = 1, then C is the only\ncomponent of FE meeting T2 , and if C * T2\u2032\u2032 = 1, then C * T2\u2032 = 0. If C\nis the only S0 -component of FE , then it is the unique (\u22121)-component.\nBy induction on the number of components it follows then from m = 2\nthat FE \u2212 C consists of (\u22122)-curves. More precisely, FE \u2212 C = E is\na fork of type (2, 2, n), with branching component a (\u22122)-curve and\nC meeting the tip of the n-twig, which consists of (\u22122) curves well.\nThis implies d(E) = a = 4, contrary to our hypothesis. Hence FE\ncontains another S0 -component C \u2032 . Since \u03a3 = 1, C and C \u2032 exhaust\nthe S0 -components of FE . By Lemma 1.8 and what we said above, we\nhave C \u2032 * T2 > 1. Since C \u2032 * T2\u2032\u2032 \u2264 1 we have C \u2032 * T2\u2032 > 0 and C * T2\u2032 = 0.\nThis means that C meets T2\u2032\u2032 , in particular that T2\u2032\u2032 6= \u2205. It now follows\nthat C \u2032 has multiplicity m\u2032 = 1 in FE since otherwise T2\u2032 * FE > 2. For\nthe same reason, C \u2032 * T2\u2032 = 1. This gives C \u2032 * T2\u2032\u2032 = 1. If C \u2032 is not a\n(\u22121)-curve then C is the unique (\u22121)-component in FE , and we reach\na contradiction to the hypothesis a > 4 as above. So C \u2032 is a (\u22121)-curve\nand it is a tip of FE since m\u2032 = 1. It follows that C \u2032 * E = 0. We\nnow contract C \u2032 and consecutively contractible components of C \u2032 + T2\u2032\u2032 .\nThen E is not touched in this process. At some stage of the process,\nC becomes the unique (\u22121)-component of the fiber. Since m = 2,\nthe remaining components of the fiber, in particular those of E, are\n(\u22122)-curves. This leads to a contradiction to the hypothesis as above.\n\n\fSINGULARITIES OF A HOMOLOGY PLANE OF GENERAL TYPE\n\n39\n\nThus any S0 -component of FE has multiplicity 1. At least one of\nthem is a (\u22121)-curve. By Lemma 1.1 (a) there is another (\u22121)-curve,\nnecessarily an S0 -component. Since \u03a3 = 1 these two exhaust the S0 components of FE , i.e., FE has precisely two (\u22121)-components, both\nof multiplicity 1. By 1.1 (f), FE is a linear chain, but it contains E,\nwhich we assumed is not a linear chain.\nConsider next the case (c). We have \u03a3 = 0 in Lemma 1.5 since now\nh = 1. So FE has a unique S0 -component C, which is also a unique\n(\u22121)-component of FE . If mult(C) = 2, then we have a contradiction\nas above. So, mult(C) \u2265 3. By Lemma 1.8, C * (U1 + U2 ) > 1. Hence\nC meets U1 and C * U1 = 1 since U1 is a 4-section, and C must also\nmeet U2 . It follows that mult(C) = 3 and that the component of U2\nwhich meets U1 has multiplicity 1 in FE . Now Lemma 1.1 (f) implies\nthat the connected component of FE \\ C containing E is a linear chain.\nIn particular, E is a linear chain. This is a contradiction.\n\u0003\nThe following result shows that the divisor D (or its dual graph) is\nstar-shaped.\nLemma 4.3. D has exactly one branching component.\nProof. In view of Lemma 4.1, we may assume that D is as in the case\n(a) of Proposition 2.16. Let D \u2212B = Z1 \u222a* * *\u222aZr be the decomposition\ninto connected components. Let Z1 , . . . Zs exhaust all connected components Zi such that Zi is a linear chain and B meets Zi in a tip. Let Cj\nbe the component of Zj such that Cj *B = 1. Then Cj 6\u2282 Supp(Bk(D))\nfor j > s.

If d(Z1 ) = d(Z2 ) = 2 we obtain\n\u03b2 = 0 contrary to our assumption. Hence d(Z1 )d(Z2 ) \u2265 6 and d(Z1 1 ) +\n1\n\u2264 56 . Now (4.4) gives d(Z3 ) \u2264 9, d(Z1 ) = 2 and d(Z2) = 3. Also\nd(Z2 )\n\u03b2 = 16 , and Z2 is a (\u22123)-curve or a chain of two (\u22122)-curves.\n(i.1) We assume that Z3 is a (2, 2, n)-fork. Then d(Z3 ) is divisible by\n4. Hence d(Z3 ) = 4 or d(Z3 ) = 8. Let B1 be the branching component\nof Z3 and let U1 , U2 be the (\u22122)-twigs of Z3 . Let T be the third twig\n(the n-twig) of Z3 which meets B in the tip C3 . Let b = \u2212B 2 , b1 = \u2212B12 .\nSuppose that Z2 is a single (\u22123)-curve. Suppose first that d(Z3 ) = 4.\nThen Z3 is a fork composed only of (\u22122)-curves and b1 = 2. Let\nZ 3 = Z3 \u2212 C3 . Then d(Z3 ) = 4 as well. We have d(D) = d(Z3 )(6b \u2212\n5) \u2212 6d(Z 3 ). Hence d(D) = 24b \u2212 44. Since d(D) < 0 and since\nb > 0 by Lemma 2.7, we obtain b = 1, i.e., B is a (\u22121)-curve, and\n\n\fSINGULARITIES OF A HOMOLOGY PLANE OF GENERAL TYPE\n\n41\n\na = \u2212d(D) = 20. The divisor F = 2(B + T + B1 ) + U1 + U2 induces a\nP1 -fibration f : S \u2192 P1 , for which Z1 and Z2 are 2-sections. We reach\na contradiction by Lemma 4.2. Suppose next that d(Z3 ) = 8. This\nimplies that C32 = \u22123 and all other components of Z3 are (\u22122)-curves.\nWe compute d(D) = 48b \u2212 64, whence b = 1 as above. We consider the\nP1 -fibration given by 2Z1 + 4B + 2T + 2B1 + U1 + U2 , for which Z2 is\na 4-section. Again we have a contradiction by Lemma 4.2.\nNow suppose that Z2 = C2 + Z2\u2032 consists of two (\u22122)-curves with C2\nmeeting B. Suppose first that d(Z3 ) = 4. As above we find d(D) =\n24b \u2212 52. Hence b = 1 or 2 since d(D) < 0. Suppose that b = 2. Then\nD consists of (\u22122)-curves and d(D) = \u22124. This implies that a = 4\nand hence E is a (2, 2, n)-fork consisting only of (\u22122)-curves. Thus\nthe generators of Pic (S) \u2297 Q are (\u22122)-curves, which implies that KS\nis numerically equivalent to 0. This is a contradiction because S is a\nrational surface. Therefore B 2 = \u22121 and d(D) = \u221228. Consider again\nthe P1 -fibration defined by 2(B + T + B1 ) + U1 + U2 . Now C2 and Z1\nare 2-sections and Z2\u2032 is contained in a fiber. This is in contradiction\nto Lemma 4.2. Suppose next that d(Z3 ) = 8. Then, as seen above,\nC32 = \u22123 and all other components of Z3 are (\u22122)-curves. We compute\nd(D) = 48b \u2212 80, whence b = 1 as d(D) < 0. We consider the P1 fribration defined by 2Z1 + 4B + 2T + 2B1 + U1 + U2 , for which C2 is\na 4-section. This is again in contradiction to Lemma 4.2.\n(i.2) We assume next that Z3 = C3 + U1 + U2 is a linear chain, where\n2\nU1 = U22 = \u22122 and B * C3 = 1. Suppose first that Z2 = C2 + Z2\u2032 . We\ncompute d(D) = (6b\u22127)(4b1 \u22124)\u221224 < 0, where b1 = \u2212C32 . By Lemma\n2.7, b1 \u2265 2 and b \u2265 1. Hence either b = b1 = 2 or b = 1. In the first\ncase, d(D) = \u22124 and hence a = 4. So E is a (\u22122)-fork of type (2, 2, n),\nD + E consists of (\u22122)-curves and we reach a contradiction as above.\nIn the second case, consider the branching component C3 . The branch\ncontaining B is a non-contractible linear chain. We find that C3 only\nfits case (iii) in Proposition 2.6, and hence \u03ba(S \u2212 (D \u2212 C3 + E)) \u2265 0.\nHowever, Z1 + 2B + C2 defines a P1 -fibration on S and an A1 -fibration\non S \u2212 (D \u2212 C3 + E), whence \u03ba(S \u2212 (D \u2212 C3 + E)) = \u2212\u221e.

We compute d(D) = 24b \u2212 36 \u2212 8d4 , where\nd4 = 1 or 2. Thus d(D) is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 3. It\nfollows from Lemma 5.1 that E is a fork of type (2, 2, n). Suppose that\nd4 = 2. Since d(D) < 0 by Lemma 3.1, we obtain b \u2264 2. If b = 2, then\na = \u2212d(D) = 4, which is ruled out by Lemma 5.2.

Hence\na C\u2217 -fibration is induced on S0 and accordingly \u03ba(S0 ) \u2264 1. This is a\ncontradiction. Hence B 2 = \u22122 by (a).

Suppose that Z21\n= \u22122. Let F = Z11 + 2B + Z21 . Then the\n1\npencil |F | induces a P -fibration f on S such that Z31 is a 2-section\nand that Z12 and Z22 , if they exist, are 1-sections. In the notation of\nLemma 1.5 we have\n(\u2217) \u03a3 = 0,1 or 2 depending on whether none, one or two of Z12 and\nZ22 exist.\nWe put Z2\u2032 = Z2 \u2212 (Z21 + Z22 ) and Z3\u2032 = Z3 \u2212 Z31 and note that they\nconsist of fiber components (if non-empty), and these are the only fiber\ncomponents not in F .\nLet FE be the fiber containing E. We recall the following consequence of Lemma 1.8.\n(\u2217\u2217) An S0 -component of FE meets D at least twice.\nSuppose that FE contains exactly one (\u22121)-component, say C. Then C\nis multiple in FE and does not meet Z12 and Z22 . In fact, mult(C) > 2,\nfor if mult(C) = 2, all other components in FE , including those of E,\nare (\u22122)-curves, which contradicts Lemma 2.17. Hence C * Z31 = 0.\nBy (\u2217\u2217) we must have Z2\u2032 6= 0, Z3\u2032 6= 0 and C * Z2\u2032 = C * Z3\u2032 = 1. As a\n(-1)-component in FE , C does not meet any further component of FE ,\nand in particular C * E = 0. So, there must exist an S0 -component C \u2032\nof FE connecting Z2\u2032 + C + Z3\u2032 to some other component of FE . Hence\nC \u2032 *Z2\u2032 = 1 or C \u2032 *Z3\u2032 = 1, but not both, since otherwise there is a loop in\nFE . In a fiber with exactly one (\u22121)-component the only components\nof multiplicity 1 are tips. Since C \u2032 meets at least two components of\nFE , mult(C \u2032 ) > 1. Hence C \u2032 does not meet Z12 and Z22 and, since Z31\nis already met by Z3\u2032 , also does not meet Z31 . So we have C \u2032 * D = 1, in\ncontradiction to (\u2217\u2217). So, FE must contain at least two (\u22121)-curves,\nC1 , C2 say.\nSuppose that none of C1 , C2 nor any other (\u22121)-component meets\nE. Then FE contains a third S0 -component C3 which meets E, for\notherwise FE is disconnected. By (\u2217), the 1-sections Z12 , Z22 exist and\nC3 is unique. We can therefore contract all (\u22121)-components and consecutively contractible components of FE \u2212 (E + C3 ), without touching\nE, until C3 becomes the unique (\u22121)-component in the fiber. Now\nthe 1-sections do not meet E and hence there exists a component of\nmultiplicity 1 not contained in E + C3 . By Lemma 1.1 (f), E is a linear\nchain. This is a contradiction.\nSuppose now that C1 meets E. Suppose also that C1 meets a component of FE \u2229 D. Then C1 is a multiple component, whence C1 * Z12 =\nC1 * Z22 = 0. Since C1 is a (\u22121)-component, it meets at most one component of FE \u2229 D and (\u2217\u2217) implies that C1 * Z31 = 1 and mult(C1 ) = 2.\n\n\f48\n\nR.V. GURJAR, M. KORAS*, M. MIYANISHI** AND P. RUSSELL***\n\nThen C2 * Z31 = 0 because Z31 * FE = 2. It also follows that no components of Z3\u2032 are contained in FE . Hence C1 meets a component of\nZ2\u2032 . We now have C2 * Z21 = 0 and C2 * Z3 = 0. By (\u2217\u2217) we must have\nC2 * Z2\u2032 = 1 and C2 * Z12 = 1. In particular, it follows that mult(C2 ) = 1.\nSuppose that C1 and C2 are the only S0 -components of FE . We contract\nC2 and consecutively contractible components of C2 +Z2\u2032 until C1 is the\nonly (\u22121)-curve in the fiber. The image of Z12 meets a component of\nthe image of Z2\u2032 , hence this component has multiplicity 1. By Lemma\n1.1 (f), E is a linear chain. This is not the case. Hence FE contains a\nthird S0 -component C3 . But now C3 * Z12 = C3 * Z22 = C3 * Z3 = 0. By\n(\u2217\u2217), C3 meets Z2\u2032 at least twice. This is impossible.\nSo, C1 as well as any (\u22121)-component in FE meeting E does not meet\na component of FE \u2229 D. If C1 meets a 1-section, mult(C1 ) = 1. If C1\ndoes not meet the 1-sections, then it must meet Z31 at least twice. In\nparticular, mult(C1 ) = 1 in any case. Suppose that C2 meets E. Then\nmult(C2 ) = 1 as well. Suppose that C2 * Z31 = 0. Then it follows from\n(\u2217\u2217) that C2 * Z12 = C2 * Z22 = 1 and C1 * Z31 = 2. As a consequence,\nZ2\u2032 and Z3\u2032 are not part of FE . If C1 , C2 are the only (\u22121)-curves in\nFE , then FE , and hence E, is a linear chain, which is not the case. So,\nthere exists a third (\u22121)-curve C3 in FE . C3 , like C1 and C2 , meets only\nsections of the fibration contained in D since Z2\u2032 and Z3\u2032 are not part of\nFE . Each Ci meets L = Z12 + Z22 + Z31 at least twice. Thus L * FE \u2265 6,\nwhile L * FE = 4, a contradiction. So C2 * Z31 > 0 and, by symmetry,\nC1 * Z31 > 0. Therefore C1 * Z12 = C1 * Z31 = C2 * Z22 = C2 * Z31 = 1\nand Z2\u2032 and Z3\u2032 are not part of FE . By the argument above there exists\na C3 . But now C3 * D = 0; a contradiction. So C2 * E = 0. There must\nexist a third S0 -component C3 in FE such that C3 * E = 1, for otherwise\nthe fiber is disconnected. If C32 = \u22121, then we reach a contradiction by\nthe above argument where we replace C2 by C3 . Hence the only (\u22121)curves in FE are C1 and C2 . Therefore mult(C2 ) > 1, for otherwise FE\nis a chain, and so C2 * Z12 = 0. Clearly, C2 * Z2 = C2 * Z2\u2032 \u2264 1, and\nby (\u2217\u2217), C2 meets Z3 . It is clear that C2 * Z3 \u2264 1, so C2 * Z3 = 1 and\nC2 * Z2\u2032 = 1. It follows that C1 * Z2 = 0. If C1 meets Z31 twice, then\nZ3\u2032 * FE and C2 *Z3 = 0, a contradiction. Hence C1 *Z31 = C1 *Z12 = 1.\nAlso C2 * Z31 = 0. Hence C2 connects Z2\u2032 and Z3\u2032 . Now C3 does not\nmeet Z12 and Z22 . Also C3 * Z31 = 0 since Z31 meets C1 and Z32 which\nis in the fiber. Thus C3 must meet Z2\u2032 and Z3\u2032 . We now have a loop in\nFE , which is a contradiction.\n\u0003\nLemma 5.7. B 2 = \u22121.\nProof. Suppose this is not the case. By Lemma 5.4 we have B 2 = \u22122.\nWe use the notations of Setup 2.1. We have Qi = Zi for i = 1, 2, 3 and\n\n\fSINGULARITIES OF A HOMOLOGY PLANE OF GENERAL TYPE\n\n49\n\nQ0 = E. Consider the decomposition\nKS + Q = KS + Q# + Bk (Q) .\nWe compare KS + Q# with P = KS + (D + E)# . Since (KS + Q# ) *\nCj = P * Cj = 0 for every component Cj of D + E \u2212 B, we have\nKS + Q# = \u03b1P for some \u03b1 \u2208 Q. Note that P is a nef Q-divisor.\nSuppose that \u03ba(Y ) = \u2212\u221e. Then \u03b1 < 0, for otherwise KS + Q# is nef,\nwhich would imply \u03ba(Y ) \u2265 0. Hence we have\n(KS + Q) * B = KS * B + 3 = \u03b1(P * B) + (Bk (Q) * B) <\n\n3\nX\ni=1\n\ne\nci ,\n\nwhere P * B > 0 for otherwise P is numerically equivalent to zero and\ne\nci denotes the coefficient of Zi1 in Bk (Zi ). Since e\nci \u2264 1, we obtain\nKS * B < 0. This is a contradiction because KS * B = 0 as B \u2243 P1 .\nThus \u03ba(Y ) \u2265 0. The pair (S, Q) is almost minimal by Lemma 2.2,\nwhere one uses the condition (i). We apply the BMY-inequality to\n(S, Q). Note that every Zi contracts to a cyclic quotient singularity\nwhose local fundamental group has order di .

If d2 = 5 then (5.3) gives d3 \u2264 4, which is a\ncontradiction to the hypothesis d2 \u2264 d3 . Suppose d2 = 4. Then d3 \u2264 5\nby (5.3). Let di be the determinant of the chain Zi2 + Zi3 + . . . + Ziki .\nBy Lemma 3.1, we have\nX di\n(5.4)\nd(D) = d1 d2 d3 (\u2212B 2 \u2212\n)<0,\ndi\nP di\nwhence\n> 2 by the assumption B 2 = \u22122. Since d2 = 4, Z2\ndi\nconsists of three (\u22122)-curves or a single (\u22124)-curve. Accordingly, we\nhave dd22 = 34 or 41 . In the latter case, we have d(D) > 0, which is not the\ncase. Hence (5.4) gives dd33 > 34 . Hence d3 6= 4, whence d3 = 5. Further,\nd3 = 4 follows as 1 \u2264 d3 \u2264 4. Now all these values give d(D) = \u22122,\nwhich contradicts Lemma 5.2 as a = \u2212d(D). Suppose d2 = 3. Then\nd2 = 2, for otherwise d(D) > 0. We find dd33 > 56 . This implies that Z3\nbegins with at least five (\u22122)-curves and that #Z3 > 5. From (5.3), we\n\n\f50\n\nR.V. GURJAR, M.

F gives rise to a\nP1 -ruling of S. D \u2212 Supp (F ) = Z1 and Z1 is a 4-section of the ruling.\nWe get contradiction with Lemma 4.2 (c).\nSuppose next that Z1 consists of (\u22122)-curves. Then Z2 and Z3 are\nsingle (\u22124)-curves by Lemma 5.6. We find a = 8. By Lemma 5.1, the\ncorresponding E is of type (2, 2, n) with n + 2 = n(h \u2212 1). This implies\nthat h = 2 and n = n + 2.

We now use some\nresults from the theory of normal affine surfaces with a C\u2217 -action such\nthat there is a unique fixed point and the closure of any orbit passes\nthrough the fixed point. We say that the C\u2217 -action is good.\nNow we can find a normal affine surface V with a good C\u2217 -action\nsatisfying the following conditions:\n\n\f58\n\nR.V. GURJAR, M. KORAS*, M. MIYANISHI** AND P. RUSSELL***\n\n(1) The C\u2217 -action has a unique fixed point p.\n(2) V has an MNC-completion V such that the boundary divisor\n\u2206 := V \\ V is a star-shaped divisor whose weighted dual graph\nis the same as that of D.\n(3) The C\u2217 -action on V extends to V .\nFor the existence of such a surface V , see [P, Thm. 2.1]. Recall,\nwith our initial set-up and notations, that H1 (S \u2032 \\ {q}, Z) is finite and\nisomorphic to the divisor class group of S \u2032 . We use V to analyze the\nmaximal abelian unramified covering T \u2192 S \u2032 \\ {q}. Let U be a small\ncontractible neighborhood of q in S \u2032 . From the isomorphism H1 (U \\\n{q}, Z) \u2192 H1 (S \u2032 \\ {q}, Z), we deduce, by making use of covering space\ntheory, that the normalization T \u2032 of S \u2032 in the function field of T is\nobtained by adding a point p to T which lies over q. Since KS \u2032 is\na torsion divisor in the divisor class group of S \u2032 , we see that KT is\na trivial line bundle and p is a rational double point. Let T be an\ne := T \\ T \u2032 .\nMNC-completion of T \u2032 which is smooth outside p. Set D\nLet N be a suitable small tubular neighborhood of D in S. Its inverse\ne is a small tubular neighborhood of D\ne in T . The natural map\nimage N\ne \\D\ne \u2192 N \\ D is a topological covering of degree a, which is equal to\nN\nthe order of H1 (S \u2032 \\ {q}, Z). It is well-known that N is obtained by the\nprocess of plumbing of disc-bundles on the irreducible components of\nD, and the 4-manifold with boundary, N, is uniquely determined by the\nweighted dual graph of D. It follows that \u2206 has a tubular neighborhood\nN\u221e in V which is C \u221e -diffeomorphic to N. The first homology groups\nH1 (S \u2032 \\ {q}, Z), H1(N \\ D, Z), H1 (V \\ {p}, Z), H1(N\u221e \\ \u2206, Z) are all\nnaturally isomorphic. We consider the maximal abelian unramified\ncovering W \u2032 \u2192 V \\{p}. Let W be the normalization of V in the function\nfield of W \u2032 . It is easy to see that W admits a good C\u2217 -action such that\nW \u2192 V is an equivariant morphism. W has an MNC-completion X\ne := X \\ W is a star-shaped\nsuch that X is smooth outside W and \u2206\ne is also star-shaped. To see this, we may\ndivisor. This implies that D\nuse a result about plumbed 4-manifolds M which says that if M is not\na lens space, the boundary 3-manifold \u2202M determines the weighted\ndivisor [Ne, Theorem 5.1].

As in the proof of Lemma\nNow we assume that D\n2.17, we see that there is an effective canonical divisor supported on\ne Since D\ne does not contain a (\u22121)-curve, we see that a minimal\nD.\nresolution of singularities Te of T has no (\u22121)-curve.

Hence Te is a\nE.\nT\nsmooth minimal projective algebraic surface. By a similar reason, it\nalso follows that Te is not ruled or rational. First we prove the following\nresult.\nLemma 6.2. If p is a smooth point of T \u2032 , then Theorem 1 is true.\n\nProof. In this case the local \u03c01 at q is a finite abelian group. This\nimplies that the local \u03c01 is actually finite cyclic by the well-known\nresults about small finite subgroups of GL(2, C). Hence Theorem 1 is\nproved if p is a smooth point.\n\u0003\nIn view of this result, we will assume that p is not a smooth point.\nLemma 6.3. Te is a surface of general type.\n\nProof. We use the classification of minimal algebraic surfaces. Te cannot\nbe an abelian surface since p is not a smooth point and the exceptional\ndivisor obtained by resolving p is a tree of rational curves contained in\nTe. Suppose that Te is a K-3 surface. Then Te is simply-connected. It is\ne are rationally independent\nnot difficult to see that the components of D\ne\nin the homology of T . From this we see that T \u2032 is a Q-homology plane,\nand arrive at a contradiction as Te is rational. Now it follows that KTe\ne\nis not trivial, and hence a strictly positive divisor supported on D.\nSuppose that Te is an elliptic surface. Let F be a general fiber of the\nelliptic fibration. Then F 2 + K * F = 0 and F 2 = 0. Hence K * F = 0.\ne being ample, F has to meet D,\ne so that K * F > 0. This proves\nBut D\nthe result.\n\u0003\nNow KT2e > 0. We will now use the BMY-inequality.

Proof of Theorem 2\nWe shall deduce Theorem 2 from Theorem 1 and the following result,\nwhere the assumptions are slightly more general than in Theorem 2,\nbut which otherwise is essentially a restatement of Theorem 2 without\nthe conclusion that Aut(V ) is cyclic.\nTheorem 7.1. Let X be a smooth homology plane of general type. Let\nG be a nontrivial subgroup of Aut(X). Then the following assertions\nhold.\n(1) There exists a unique fixed point P of X under the G-action\nand G acts freely on X \\ {P }.\n(2) G is a small finite subgroup of GL(2, C) (in the induced action\non the tangent space at P ).\n(3) The quotient surface X \u2032 = X/G has a unique singular point Q\nand the local fundamental group at Q is G.\n(4) If X is contractible, equivalently if X is simply connected, then\n\u03c01 (X0 ) = G, where X0 = X \u2032 \\ {Q}.\nWe need the following lemmas.\nLemma 7.2. Let X and G be as above. Then the quotient X \u2032 = X//G\nis Z-acyclic.\n\n\fSINGULARITIES OF A HOMOLOGY PLANE OF GENERAL TYPE\n\n61\n\nProof. This is a standard result in Smith Theory of finite group actions\non simplicial complexes. It is well-known that any complex algebraic\nvariety is triangulable [Gi]. Clearly the corresponding simplicial complex is finite dimensional. Since X is Z-acyclic, by ([Br], Chapter 3,\nTheorem 5.4) X/G is also Z-acyclic.\n\u0003\nLemma 7.3. Let X be as above. Then there are no contractible curves\non X.\nProof. Suppose that there exists a contractible curve C on X. Set\nY = X \\ C. Then Y is a smooth affine surface of general type. Let\nZ be an almost minimal model of Y . Since Y is affine, Z is an open\nset of Y and Y \\ Z is a disjoint union of affine lines [GM]. Then\n\u03c7(Z) \u2264 \u03c7(Y ) = 0. Meanwhile, the BMY-inequality implies \u03c7(Z) > 0,\nwhich is a contradiction.\n\u0003\nLemma 7.4. Let X be a homology plane with an effective action of a\ncyclic group H of prime order. Then we have :\n(1) The fixed point locus X H is connected.\n(2) If dim X H = 1 then X H is an affine line.\nProof. See [MS, Lemma 1.5].\n\n\u0003\n\nProof of Theorem 7.1. It is well known that Aut(X) is finite (since\n\u03ba(X) = 2). We now proceed in several steps.\nStep 1. By Lemma 7.2 \u03c7(X \u2032 ) = 1. We claim that there is a point\nP \u2208 X with nontrivial isotropy group. In fact, otherwise the quotient\nmorphism q : X \u2192 X \u2032 is an \u00e9tale finite morphism. Hence \u03c7(X) =\n|G|\u03c7(X \u2032). Since \u03c7(X) = \u03c7(X \u2032 ) = 1 this is a contradiction.\nStep 2. Let P \u2208 X be a point with nontrivial isotropy group HP .\nThen the tangential representation of HP on TX,P does not contain a\npseudo-reflection. In fact, if an element h is a pseudo-reflection, we may\nassume that h has prime order p. Let H be the cyclic group generated\nby h. Then dim X H = 1. Now X H is an affine line by Lemma 7.4, and\nthis is impossible by Lemma 7.3. This implies that X HP is a single\npoint.\nStep 3. Let Q = q(P ). Then q \u22121 (Q) consists of n points P1 , . . . , Pn ,\nwhere P1 = P and n = [G : HP ]. We shall show that there is a unique\npoint P with nontrivial isotropy group, which becomes a fixed point\nunder G. In fact, let {P11 , . . . , P1n1 , P21 , . . . , P2n2 , . . . , Pr1 , . . . , Prnr }\nexhaust all points of X with nontrivial isotropy groups, where Pi1 , . . . ,\nPini have conjugate isotropy groups for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r. Then Pi1 , . . . , Pini\n\n\f62\n\nR.V. GURJAR, M. KORAS*, M. MIYANISHI** AND P. RUSSELL***\n\nare mapped to the same point Qi of X \u2032 . Since q : X \\{P11 , . . . , Prnr } \u2192\nX \u2032 \\ {Q1 , . . . , Qr } is an \u00e9tale finite morphism, we have the equality\n\u03c7(X) \u2212 (n1 + * * * + nr ) = |G|(\u03c7(X \u2032 ) \u2212 r). Let mi be the order of the\nisotropy group of Pi1 . Then ni mi = |G|. Since \u03c7(X) = \u03c7(X \u2032 ) = 1, we\ndeduce the equality\n1\n1\n1\nr\u22121=\n+***+\n\u2212\n.\nm1\nmr |G|\nSince mi \u2265 2, we have\nr\u22121\u2264\n\n1\nr\nr\n\u2212\n< .\n2 |G|\n2\n\nHence r = 1 since r > 0 by step 1. So, r = 1 and m1 = |G|, i.e. there\nis a unique isotropy group and it is a G-fixed point. This proves the\nassertion (1).\nStep 4. We shall prove the remaining assertions. Let \u03c1 : G \u2192\nGL(2, C) be the tangential representation at the point P . Then \u03c1 is\ninjective. In fact, if g is in the kernel of \u03c1, then g acts trivially on the\ncompletion of OX,P , and hence on OX,P . Hence g is the identity. By\nstep 2, G is a small finite subgroup of GL(2, C). Let Q = q(P ). Then\nq : X \\ {P } \u2192 X \u2032 \\ {Q} is a Galois \u00e9tale covering with group G. Also,\nq induces a covering U \u2192 U \u2032 , where U is a simply connected punctured\nneighborhood of P and U \u2032 a punctured neighborhood of Q. This proves\n(3). Under the assumptions of (4), X \\ {P } is simply connected, so\n\u03c01 (X \u2032 \\ {Q}) = G.\n\u2737\nProof of Theorem 2. All statements except that Aut(V ) is cyclic\nfollow from Theorem 7.1. In particular, Aut(V ) is the local fundamental group at q. Now V \u2032 = V /Aut(V ) is Z-acyclic by Lemma 7.2 and\n\u03ba(V \u2032 \\ {q}) = \u03ba(V \\ {p}) = \u03ba(V ) = 2. Hence Aut(V ) is cyclic by\nTheorem 1.\n\u2737\nReferences\n[B] E. Brieskorn, Rationale Singularit\u00e4ten komplexer Fl\u00e4chen, Inventiones math.\n4 (1968), 336\u2013358.\n[Br] G.
