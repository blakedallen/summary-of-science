Gilbert damping is understood\nto be a non-linear spin relaxation phenomenon and it controls the rate at which magnetization spins reach equilibrium. The introduction of this term is phenomenological\nin nature [3] and the question of whether it has an intrinsic physical origin has not been fully addressed, in\nthe face of rather successful modeling of the relaxation\ndynamics of measured systems. Correlating ferromagnetic resonance spectral line-widths [4, 5] in magnetic\nthin films with the change in damping has been successful for confirming the form of the damping term in the\nunderlying dynamical equations. The intrinsic origin of\nthe damping itself is still an open question. The damping\nconstant, \u03b1 is often reformulated in terms of a relaxation\ntime, and the dominant relaxation processes are invoked\nto calculate this, but this approach presupposes precessional damping torque.\nIt has been long thought that intrinsic Gilbert damping had its origin in spin-orbital coupling because this\nmechanism does not conserve spin, but it has never been\nderived from a coherent framework. Non-local spin relaxation processes [6] and disorder broadening couple to\nthe spin dynamics and can enhance the Gilbert damping extrinsically in thin films and heterostructures. This\ntype of spin relaxation, which is equivalent to ensemble\ndephasing [7], is modeled as the (S-S0 )/T\u22172 decay term\nin the dynamical Bloch equation, where T\u22172 is the decay\ntime of the ensemble of spins. Crudely speaking, during\nspin relaxation, some spins lag behind the mean magnetization vector and the exchange and magnetostatic\nfields then exert a time dependent torque. Calculations\non relaxation driven damping of this kind presuppose the\nGilbert damping term itself which begs the question.\nThe inhomogeneous damping term can be written as\nM \u00d7 d\u22072 M/dt which gives rise to non-local effects such\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\nmail : hickey@mit.edu\n\nas spin wave dissipation [6, 8]. These non-local theories are successful in quantifying the enhancement of the\nGilbert damping, but do not derive the intrinsic Gilbert\nterm itself. There are models [9, 10] which deal with\nthe scattering of electron spins from thermal equilibrium\nin the presence of phonon and spin-orbital interactions\nwhich is a dynamic interaction and this allows us to determine the strength of the Gilbert damping for itinerant ferromagnetic metals, generalizing the Gilbert damping response to a tensorial description. Both the s-d\nexchange relaxation models [11, 12] and the Fermi surface breathing models of Kambersky [9, 13] either presuppose a Gilbert damping term in the dynamical equation or specify a phenomenological Hamiltonian H = 1/(\u03b3Ms )\u03b1\u0302.dM/dt. While this method is ab initio from\nthe point of view of electronic structure, it already assumes the Gilbert term ansatz. Hankiewicz et al. [14]\nconstruct the inhomogeneous Gilbert damping by connecting the spin density-spin current conservation law\nwith the imaginary part of magnetic susceptibility tensor and show that both electron-electron and impurity\nscattering can enhance the damping through the transverse spin conductivity for finite wavelength excitations\n(q 6= 0). In previous work [15], there are derivations\nof the Gilbert constant by comparing the macroscopic\ndamping term with the torque-torque correlations in homogeneously magnetized electron gases possessing spin\norbital coupling. For the case of intrinsic, homogeneous\nGilbert damping, it is thought that in the absence of\nspin-orbital scattering, the damping vanishes. We aim to\nfocus on intrinsic, homogeneous damping and its physical\norigin in a first-principles framework and the question as\nto whether spin in a homogeneous time-varying magnetization can undergo Gilbert damping is addressed.\nIn this work, we show that Gilbert damping does indeed\narise from spin-orbital coupling, in the sense that it is\ndue to relativistic corrections to the Hamiltonian which\ncouple the spin to the electric field and we arrive at the\nGilbert damping term by first writing down the Dirac\nequation for electrons in magnetic and electric potentials.\nWe transform the Hamiltonian in such a way as to write\nit in a basis in which the canonical momentum terms are\n\n\f2\neven powers. This is a standard approach in relativistic\nquantum mechanics and we do this in order to calculate\nthe terms which couple the linear momentum to the spin\nin a basis which is diagonal in spin space. This is often\nreferred to as a non-relativistic expansion of the Dirac\nequation. This allows us to formulate the contributions\nas a perturbation to an otherwise non-relativistic particle. We then wish to calculate the rate equation for the\nspin observable with all of the spin-orbital corrections in\nmind.\nNow, we start with a purely relativistic particle, a Dirac\nparticle and we write the Dirac-Pauli Hamiltonian, as\nfollows :\nA\n) + \u03b2m0 c2 + e\u03c6\nc\n= O + \u03b2m0 c2 + \u03b5\n\nH = c\u03b1.(p \u2212 e\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nwhere A and \u03c6 are the magnetic vector potential and the\nelectrostatic potential, respectively and\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0 \u03c3i\n\u03b1=\n\u03c3i 0\nwhile\n\u0012\n\u03b2=\n\n1 0\n0 \u22121\n\n\u0013\n.\n\nWe observe immediately that \u03b2O = \u2212O\u03b2. O is the Dirac\ncanonical momentum , c and e are the speed of light in\na vacuum and the electronic charge, respectively.\nWe now need to rewrite the Hamiltonian in a basis where\nthe odd operators (whose generators are off diagonal in\nthe Pauli-Dirac basis : \u03b1i , \u03b3 i ,\u03b35 ..) and even operators\n(whose generators are diagonal in the Pauli-Dirac basis :\n(1, \u03b2, \u03a3,.. ) are decoupled from one another.\n0\nIf we are to find S so that H does not contain odd powers\nof spin operators, we must chose the operator S, in such\na way as to satisfy the following constraint :\n[S, \u03b2] =\n\n\u2212O\nim0 c2\n\n(3)\n\nIn order to satisfy cancelation of the odd terms of O\n\u2212iO\u03b2\nto first order, we require S = 2m\n2 and this is known\n0c\nas the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation in relativistic\nquantum mechanics and it is treated in some detail in,\nfor example, reference [16]. We now would like to collect\nall of the terms into the transformed Hamiltonian, and\nthis is written as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0\nO2\nO4\nH = \u03b2 m0 c2 +\n\u2212\n2m0 c2\n8m30 c6\n1\n\u03b2\nO3\n+\u03b5 \u2212\n[O, [O, \u03b5]] +\n[O, \u03b5] \u2212\n2\n4\n2\n8m0 c\n2m0 c\n3m20 c4\nThe expression above contains odd powers of the canonical momentum O, so we redefine the canonical momentum to encapsulate all of these odd power terms.

The terms\nwhich couple to the spin \u03a3 are of importance and we see\nthat these terms correspond to the Zeeman, spin-orbital\n(comprising momentum and electric field curl terms) and\nthe Darwin term, respectively. Strictly speaking, the\npresence of the scalar potential \u03c6 breaks the gauge invariance in the Pauli-Dirac Hamiltonian and a fully gauge invariant theory would require that this contain the gaugefree electromagnetic field energy. We omit the term\ne2 ~\n4m2 c3 \u03a3.(A \u00d7 E) (which establishes gauge invariance in\nthe momentum terms) in this rotated Hamiltonian, as it\nis O(1/m2 c3 ) and we are only interested in calculating\nsemiclassical rate equations for fields, which are manifestly gauge-invariant, and not wavefunctions or energy\neigenvalues. We can now define the spin dependent corrections to a non-relativistic Hamiltonian :\n\nH\u03a3 = \u2212\n\ne~\ne~\nie~2\n\u03b2\u03a3.B\u2212\n\u03a3.E\u00d7p\u2212\n\u03a3.(\u2207\u00d7E).\n2m0 c2\n4m20 c2\n8m20 c2\n(6)\n\nwhere\n\u0012\n\u03a3=\n\n\u03c3i 0\n0 \u03c3i\n\n\u0013\n\u2261 \u015ci .\n\n\f3\nand \u03c3i are the Pauli matrices. Note that the last\ntwo terms in Equation 6 encapsulate the entire spin\norbital coupling in the sense that these terms couple\nthe particle's linear momentum to the spin \u015ci . The\nfirst spin-orbital term in the Hamiltonian is well known\nand give rise to momentum dependent magnetic fields.\nWhen the ensuing dynamics are calculated for this\ncase, it gives rise to spin relaxation terms which are\nlinear in spin [17]. Note that, while neither spin-orbital\nterm is Hermitian, the two terms taken together are\nHermitian and so the particles angular momentum\nis a conserved quantity and the total energy lost in\ngoing from collective spin excitations (spin waves) to\nsingle particles states via spin-orbital coupling is gained\nby the electromagnetic field. Recognizing the curl of\nthe electric field in the last term, we now rewrite this\nthe time varying magnetic field as given by Maxwells\nequations as \u2207 \u00d7 E = \u2212 \u2202B\n\u2202t . We now have an explicitly\ntime-dependent perturbation on the non-relativistic\nHamiltonian. We can write the time-varying magnetic\nfield seen by the spin (in, for example a magnetic\n\u2202B\n\u2202M\n\u22121 \u2202M\nmaterial) as \u2202B\n\u2202t = \u2202M * \u2202t = \u03bc0 (1 + \u03c7m ) \u2202t .

In this way, the rate equation is\nestablished from a time dependent perturbation expansion in the quantum Liouville description.\nnow define\nX We\ng\u03bcB\nthe magnetization observable as M\u0302 =\nT r\u03c1\u015c\u03b1 (t)\nV\n\u03b1\nwhere the summation is taken over the site of the magnetization spin \u03b1. We now examine the time dependence of\nthis observable by calculating the rate equation according\nto the quantum-Liouville rate equation ;\nd\u03c1(t)\n1\n+ [\u03c1\u0302, H] = 0\ndt\ni~\n\n(8)\n\nThis rate equation governs the time-evolution of the\nmagnetization observable as defined above, in the nonequilibrium regime. We can write the time derivative of\n\nthe magnetization [18], as follows ;\ndM X g\u03bcb\n1\n\u2202\u03c1 \u03b1\n\u2202S\u03b1\n=\nh\u03a8n (t)| [\u03c1S\u03b1 , H] +\nS +\u03c1\n|\u03a8n (t)i,\ndt\nV\ni~\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\nn,\u03b1\n\nand we can use the quantum Liouville rate equation as\ndefined by Equation 8 to simplify this expression and we\narrive at the following rate equation :\ndM X g\u03bcb 1\n=\nT r{\u03c1[S\u03b1 , H S (t)]}\ndt\nV\ni~\n\u03b1\n\n(9)\n\nIn the case of the time dependent Hamiltonian derived\nin equation 7, we can assume a first order dynamical\nequation of motion given by dM\ndt = \u03b3M\u00d7H and calculate\nthe time evolution for the magnetization observable :\n\u2190\n\u2192\n2\ndM X g\u03bcB 1\ni ie~ \u03bc0 j\n\u22121 \u2202 M\n=\nT r\u03c1[S\u03b1 ,\nS ].(1 + \u03c7m )\ndt\nV i~\n8m2 c2 \u03b2\ndt\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\n\u2190\n\u2192\nX g\u03bcB ie~2 \u03bc0 1\n\u2202 Ml\nk\n\u22121\nT r\u03c1i~\u000fijk S\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 (1 + \u03c7m )\u03b4jl\n=\n2 c2 i~\nV\n8m\ndt\n\u03b1\n\u2190\n\u2192\ne~\u03bc0\n\u2202M\n= \u2212i 2 2 (1 + \u03c7\u22121\n)M\n\u00d7\n,\nm\n8m c\ndt\nwhere, in the last two steps, we have used the following commutation relations for magnetization spins :\n[S\u03b1i , S\u03b2j ] = i~\u000fijk S\u03b1k \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 which implies that the theory presented here is that which relates to local dynamics and\nthat the origin of the damping is intrinsic. We now recognize the last equation as the which describes Gilbert\ndamping, as follows :\n\u2190\n\u2192\n\u2202M\ndM\n\u03b1\n=\u2212\n.M \u00d7\ndt\nMs\n\u2202t\n\n(10)\n\nwhereby the constant \u03b1 is defined as follows :\n\n\u03b1=\n\n\u0001\nie~\u03bc0 Ms\n1 + \u03c7\u22121\nm\n2\n2\n8m0 c\n\n(11)\n\nThe \u03b1 defined above corresponds with the Gilbert\ndamping found in the phenomenological term in the\nLandau-Lifschitz-Gilbert equation and \u03c7m is the magnetic susceptibility. In general, the inverse of the susceptibility can be written in the form [19],\n\u22121\n\u03c7\u22121\nij (q, \u03c9) = \u03c7\u0303\u22a5 (q, \u03c9) \u2212\n\n\u03c9ex\n\u03b4ij ,\n\u03b3\u03bc0 M0\n\n(12)\n\nwhere the equilibrium magnetization points along the zaxis and \u03c9ex is the excitation frequency associated with\nthe internal exchange field. The \u03b4ij term in the inverse susceptibility does not contribute to damping mechanisms as it corresponds to the equilibrium response.\n\n\f4\nIn the basis (Mx \u00b1 iMy ,Mz ), we have the dimensionless\ntransverse magnetic susceptibility, as follows :\n\u03c7\u0303m\u22a5 (q, \u03c9) = \u03b3\u03bc0\n\nM0 \u2212 i\u03b3\u03c3\u22a5 q 2\n\u03c90 \u2212 \u03c9 \u2212 i\u03b3\u03c3\u22a5 q 2 \u03c90 /M0\n\nThe first term in the dimensionless Gilbert coefficient\n(Equation 11) is small (\u223c 10\u221211 ) and the higher damping rate is controlled by the the inverse of the susceptibility tensor. For uniformly saturated magnetization,\nthe damping is critical and so the system is already at\nequilibrium as far as the Gilbert mechanism is concerned\n(dM/dt = 0 in this scenario). The expression for the\ndimensionless damping constant \u03b1 in the dc limit (\u03c9 =0\n) is :\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\ni\u03c3\u22a5 q2 \u03c90\n\u03c90\ne~\u03bc0 Ms\n\u03b3\u03bc0 M0 \u2212 \u03bc0 M02\n\uf8f8,\nIm \uf8ed\n(13)\n\u03b1=\n8m20 c2\n1 \u2212 i\u03b3\u03c3\u22a5 q2 /M0\nand we have the transverse spin conductivity from the\nfollowing relation (in units whereby ~=1) :\n\u0012\n\u0013\nn\n1\n1\n\u03c3\u22a5 =\n+\n,\nee\ndis\n4m\u2217 \u03c902 \u03c4\u22a5\n\u03c4\u22a5\ndis\nee\nwhere \u03c4\u22a5\nand \u03c4\u22a5\nare the impurity disorder and electron\nelectron-electron scattering times as defined and parameterized in Reference [14]. We calculate the extrinsically\nenhanced Gilbert damping using the following set of parameters as defined in the same reference ; number density of the electron gas, n=1.4\u00d71027 m\u22123 , polarization p,\nequilibrium magnetization M0 = \u03b3pn/2, equilibrium excitation frequency \u03c90 = EF [(1 + p)2/3 \u2212 (1 \u2212 p)2/3 ] and\nwave-number defined as q = 0.1 kF , where EF and kF\nare the Fermi energy and Fermi wave number, respectively. m\u2217 is taken to be the electronic mass. Using these\nquantities, we evaluate \u03b1 values and these are plotted as\na function of both polarization and disorder scattering\nrate in Figure 1.\nIn general, the inverse susceptibility \u03c7\u22121\nm will determine the strength of the damping in real inhomogeneous\nmagnetic systems where spin relaxation takes place, subbands are populated by spin orbit scattering and spin\nwaves and spin currents are emitted. The susceptibility term gives the Gilbert damping a tensorial quality,\nagreeing with the analysis in Reference [10]. Further, the\nconnection between the magnetization dynamics and the\nelectric field curl provides the mechanism for the energy\nloss to the electromagnetic field. The generation of radiation is caused by the rotational spin motion analog of\nelectric charge acceleration and the radiation spin interaction term has the form :\n\nH S (t) = i\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that the Gilbert term,\nheretofore phenomenologically used to describe damping\n\n\u0001\ne~2 \u03bc0 X\ndM\n1 + \u03c7\u22121\n.\nm S\u03b1 .\n2\n2\n8m0 c \u03b1\ndt\n\n(14)\n\nFIG. 1: (Color Online) Plot of the dimensionless Gilbert\ndamping constant \u03b1 in the dc limit (\u03c9=0), as a function of\nelectron spin polarization and disorder scattering rate.\n\nin magnetization dynamics, is derivable from first principles and its origin lies in spin-orbital coupling. By a\nnon-relativistic expansion of the Dirac equation, we show\nthat there is a term which contains the curl of the electric field. By connecting this term with Maxwells equation to give the total time-varying magnetic induction,\nwe have found that this damping term can be deduced\nfrom the rate equation for the spin observable, giving the\ncorrect vector product form and sign of Gilberts' original phenomenological model. Crucially, the connection\nof the time-varying magnetic induction and the curl of\nthe electric field via the Maxwell relation shows that\nthe damping of magnetization dynamics is commensurate with the emission of electromagnetic radiation and\nthe radiation-spin interaction is specified from first principles arguments.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nM.
