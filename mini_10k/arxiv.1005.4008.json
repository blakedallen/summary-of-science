INTRODUCTION\nNIVERSITIES, research centers and most\nteaching and researching institutions hold\nand produce periodically loads of knowledge\nand information. Besides their own knowledge, these\ninstitutions are always looking for new means to\naccess documents from the same areas kept back in\nother research centers. This wealth of knowledge must\nbe properly organized and disseminated in order to\nmaximize its use. Information and Communication\nTechnologies (ICT) offer every day new and better\ntools for cataloging, storing, retrieving and\ndistributing knowledge, and the current tendency\nseems to point to Institutional Repositories (IRs) or\nDigital Libraries (DLs), where information can be\nmanaged and users can access to new or improved\nservices. The combination of these repositories with\nmost currently active initiatives for open intellectual\ncreation sharing -such as Open Access Movement\n(OA), Open Archives Initiative (OAI), Creative\nCommons and Budapest Open Access Initiative\n(BOAI)- results in the availability of millions of\ncontent records. One big challenge for repositories is\n\nto find which mechanisms are the most suitable for\nobtaining, holding and offering these records to their\nusers.\nIn contrast to general purpose search engines (such as\nGoogle, Yahoo! and Bing), IRs usually offer highquality scientific and academic documents. DLs and\nIRs users -researchers, professors and high level\nstudents- are characterized by their specialization in\none or more areas of knowledge, and by their\npermanent interest for updated information in those\nareas. Users attention are captured in DLs and IRs by\ndifferent services oriented to make it easy to publish\nand distribute their work, and to gain access to other\nresearch works inside the same scope.\nThe addition of new research works must be\npublicized as soon as possible so interested users can\ntake advantage of them. Now a new challenge arises\nfrom the past definition: how to identify which users\nmight be interested in a determined work (extended,\nof course, to thousands of users and millions of\ndocuments).\nUsers' profiles are the main source to find out which\nadditions might be interested for them. A proper\n\n\fJOURNAL OF COMPUTING, VOLUME 2, ISSUE 5, MAY 2010, ISSN 2151-9617\nHTTPS://SITES.GOOGLE.COM/SITE/JOURNALOFCOMPUTING/\nWWW.JOURNALOFCOMPUTING.ORG\n\nprofile representation will enable the system to obtain\ninformation beyond what the user has specified. This\nway, it could be possible to apply inference\nmechanisms and comparisons against other users'\nprofiles. For that reason, user profiles must be seen\nlike a complex feature rather than just a list of\npreferences; there must be considered a whole context\nin which profiles exist and relate one to another.\nAlternatives include key-value representations, object\nmodel and ontologies. This work is focused on the use\nof ontologies to represent users profiles as part of a\ncontext, because of its dynamic nature to extend\nprofiles from and adapt profiles as the context\nchanges. Advantages and possibilities given by this\nrepresentation are considered for a Selective\nDissemination of Information (SDI) service in the\nIntellectual Creation and Dissemination Service\n(Servicio de Difusi\u00f3n de la Creaci\u00f3n Intelectual,\nSeDiCI), La Plata National University (UNLP)\ninstitutional repository.\n\n2. SEDICI, UNLP INSTITUTIONAL REPOSITORY\nSeDiCI was born with the purpose of socialize the\nknowledge generated in all academic areas of UNLP,\naiming to give back to the community the efforts put\nto the Public University. This main purpose covers\nothers more specific, including:\no\nto offer a service for digital theses,\nmaking them public to the whole local and\ninternational community and generating links\namong researchers;\no\nto create a local culture about DL\nuse, and to encourage researchers to share\ntheir work in a common space for all\ndisciplines;\no\nto include UNLP into other existing\ndigital resources networks .\nEven though SeDiCI was first created as a theses-only\nservice, it was almost immediately extended to all sort\nof digital documents to satisfy users' needs from the\ndifferent Schools. Given the heterogeneous nature of\nUNLP, SeDiCI holds a variety of documents which\nincludes\nscientific\npapers,\npictures,\nmusical\ndocuments, conference presentations, research\nprojects and, of course, theses.\n\n7\n\n2.1 Inside SeDiCI: services for users\nSeDiCI users can be document authors, project\ndirectors, researchers or simply readers. All users can\naccess all existing services inside SeDiCI. To mention a\nfew of them, users can create folders and put there\ndocuments selected from a search. There also exist an\non-line chat, from which users can obtain SeDiCI\nadministrators help on very specific information\ntopics. Users can also subscribe to searches and then\nautomatically receive news about new documents\nadded to the repository that match their query\naccording to a free temporal scheme (every 15 days,\nevery month, every week, etc); this can be considered\nas a initial scheme for a SDI service.\n\n2.2 Outside SeDiCI: interfacing repositories\naround the world\nUNLP members and external SeDiCI users always\nneed updated contents from multiple disciplines. To\nachieve this purpose, SeDiCI plays the role of OAI\nService Provider over an increasing amount of\nexternal repositories, exceeding 12 million information\nrecords so far. As counterpart, SeDiCI also plays the\nrole of Data Provider, by which all works created\ninside UNLP and stored/published by SeDiCI are\noffered to any OAI Service Provider.\nUNLP libraries can also access SeDiCI documents via\nweb services, and offer a larger set of resources to\ntheir own users, in a completely transparent fashion.\n\n3. SDI IN DYNAMIC WEB ENVIRONMENTS\nIn the field of DL, many systems for content-based\nrecommendation have been designed, in which\nnotifications are sent periodically or by request,\ninforming users about existing resources according to\ntheir interests. This kind of service, which try to\nsatisfy highly specialized users with very specific\nneeds, are based on a predefined profile created in the\nlibrary for each user[1] [2].\nSDI is a process by which users express their\ninformation needs either explicitly or inferred by the\nsystem and then receive notifications through\ninformation providers participating in the SDI. Users\nprofiles may take different shapes, from a text-free\nquery, a SQL query or a set of rules.\nFor a successful SDI it is necessary a solid user profile\nconfiguration, consisting of a selection of languages,\ndocument types, publication years, countries of origin,\n\n\f8\n\nJOURNAL OF COMPUTING, VOLUME 2, ISSUE 5, MAY 2010, ISSN 2151-9617\nHTTPS://SITES.GOOGLE.COM/SITE/JOURNALOFCOMPUTING/\nWWW.JOURNALOFCOMPUTING.ORG\n\nauthors and a notification mean. Besides, the system resources selected or downloaded by the user and\nmust make sure that every time a user receives news, even all queries made to the system.\nhe will quickly identify which recommendations\ncorrespond to which profiles (given that users may 4.2 Context representation through Ontologies\nhave more than one profile).\nOne of the biggest problem of SDI systems is the\nidentification of users profiles. In general, users can\nspecify certain parameters such as Preferences, Areas\nof Interest and probably Subscription to Searches.\nHowever there is much more contextual information\n-which belongs to the user profile- that users are\nnot always able to define, either because of system\nlimitations, complexity of the information itself, or\nsimply because users do not always recognize all their\nneeds. Consequently it seems evident that systems\nmust be extended to improve or optimize users\nprofiles, capturing information from the context,\ninferring data from each profile and identifying\nopportunities beyond users explicit preferences.\n\n4. CONTEXT-AWARE DIGITAL LIBRARIES\n4.1 The Context\nThere exist many definitions for context; most of them\nhave similar characteristics for the scope of this work.\nThe concept of context has been studied by\nphilosophers, psychologists, linguistics and recently\nengineers. From the computer science point of view,\ncontext has been defined as formal, abstract and firstclass free of representation citizens in Logic and\nArtificial Intelligence; as routines over a set of entities\nin Programming Languages; and as sorted set of pairs\nwith some operations among them in Systems[3].\nReto Krummenacher y Thomas Strang [4]have defined\ncontext as \"any information that can be used to\ncharacterize the situation of an entity. An entity can be\na person, a place or an object considered relevant for\nthe interaction between the user and the application,\nincluding the user and the application itself\".\nIn the paper Context Aware Retrieval in Web-Based\nCollaborations[5], authors define context as \"any\ninformation used to define the user environment\",\nand they highlight the difference between Current\nContext (CC) and other user contexts.\nIn general, context definitions include both the user\nand the information associated directly with each\nuser, which is the user profile. This is not too different\nin the field of digital libraries, since the context of the\nuser is made up of a set of areas of interest (or\nresearch areas), the user work group members, all\n\nThere exist many ways to represent the context:\no\no\no\no\no\n\nvia an Object Model;\nusing a markup language;\nwith a set of key-value pairs;\nbased on logic;\nusing graphics.\n\nTraditionally, the model of the context is created\nfollowing a top-down mechanism: first the application\nand its functionality is defined, and then the necessary\nontologies for the context are developed. Ontologies\nare commonly used to formalize taxonomies that\nrepresent types and values of simple properties. But\nthere is more behind the ontology-based modeling. A\ngeneric and reusable ontology will have a direct\nimpact in the interoperability of context-aware\nsystems, and therefore will have a direct influence on\nthe speed to create, implement and integrate new\napplications. A well designed model is a key factor to\naccess the context as well as to adapt to changes,\nwhich is very common in dynamic systems.\nIn the work A Context Modeling Survey[6], authors\nidentify 6 main requirements that any context model\napplied to ubiquitous systems must accomplish:\no Distributed Composition: ubiquitous systems\nderive directly from distributed systems. The\ncomposition and administration of the context\nmodel and its data has a clear dynamism that\nvaries in terms of time, network topology and\nsource of information.\no Partial Validation: it is desirable to validate\ncontextual knowledge both in the structure as\nwell as in the instance level, even if the model is\nnot located in one single node because of its\ndistributed nature. Given the complexity of\ninterrelations in the context, it turns very\nimportant to validate it.\no Richness and quality of information:\ninformation sources to characterize entities are\nvery different, but this should not affect the\nquality of the information.\no Lack of complexity and ambiguity: in\nparticular, if the information is retrieved from\nsensors or inferred from other information sets.\nThe model should be able to interpolate\n\n\fJOURNAL OF COMPUTING, VOLUME 2, ISSUE 5, MAY 2010, ISSN 2151-9617\nHTTPS://SITES.GOOGLE.COM/SITE/JOURNALOFCOMPUTING/\nWWW.JOURNALOFCOMPUTING.ORG\n\nincomplete data, only if this interpolation does\nnot affect data quality.\no Level of formality: to describe facts and\nrelationships in a precise and traceable way.\no Applicability to existing environments: a\ncontext model must allow its use in pre-existing\ncomputing environment infrastructure.\nOntologies are a powerful tool to specify concepts and\nrelationships. They provide formalizations to map\nreal-life\nentities\nto\ncomputer-enabled\ndata\nconstructions. In this sense, ontologies provide a\nuniform methodology for specifying model concepts,\nsub-concepts, relationships, properties and facts, and\nall this provide the basis for context knowledge\nsharing and information reusing. With this\ninformation, computer applications can determine\ncontextual compatibility, compare contextual facts,\ninfer new facts and even new contexts. The possibility\nto infer new context results particularly interesting for\nthe lack of completeness of the context.\nAlthough the use of ontologies has many advantages,\nit is not always easy to differentiate them from using\nother methodologies. Object Oriented Models also\nprovide class hierarchy, and therefore they permit at\nleast a limited formalization of instances and classes\ndependency models. In addition to that, OO models\njust like ontology-based models permit to achieve the\ndistributed\ncomposition\nrequirement;\npartial\nvalidation in OO models is also possible, typically\nusing a compiler at the structure level and an\nexecution environment at the instance level[6]. Thus it\nis necessary to analyze the needs of the computing\napplications involved in each case. Conclusions lead\nto assert that an improved user experience is generally\nbased on data providing from sensors and different\ninformation sources. This makes applications strongly\nbound to the context require to cope with more and\nmore heterogeneous data (which also counts for\nambiguity, quality and contextual data validation\nproblems). OO models require, for instance, a low\nlevel implementation of these relationships to achieve\ninteroperability and therefore they not always result\nproper for knowledge sharing in open and dynamic\nenvironments[7].\nThere exist many alternatives to represent the context\nthrough ontologies. In [8] authors find necessary to\nnormalize and combine knowledge coming from\ndifferent domains, and they propose a highly\nnormalized and formal ontology-base model. In the\nyear 2003 the language CoOL (Context Ontology\nLanguage, [9]) was introduced. This language,\nderived from ASC (Aspect-Scale-Context) model, can\n\n9\n\nbe used to enable context sensibility and contextual\ninteroperability during service discovering and\nexecution. The proposed architecture is distributed,\nand has among its element a core with a reasoner, able\nto infer conclusions about the context based on an\nontology defined with CoOL. This ability to infer\ninformation from preexisting data is particularly\ninteresting for the scope of this work, as will be seen\nbelow.\nFollowing a similar line is CONON (Wang et al. [9]).\nEven though the idea is basically the same as CoOL\n(knowledge reuse ability, logic inference, knowledge\nsharing), there exists a highest level ontology which\ncaptures general characteristics from context entities,\nas well as a collection of sub-domain specific\nontologies. CONON ontologies are representated via\nOWL-DL which, thanks to the use of description logic,\npermits consistency checking and contextual\nreasoning using inference engines developed for\ndescription languages.\nOne last and interesting approximation is represented\nin the CoBrA (Context Broker Architecture, [10])\nsystem, which provides a set of ontological concepts\nfor characterizing entities such as people, places or\nany object inside its context. The idea behind CoBrA is\nto provide additional support for agents with limited\nresources to make them context-aware. This is\nachieved through an architecture that helps these\nagents to acquire knowledge, to reason about that\nknowledge and to share it with the context. There is a\nContext Broker which maintains and manages a\nshared contextual model for a community of agents.\nThese agents can be applications being executed from\nmobile devices, services provided by devices in a\nroom and web services simulating the presence of\npeople, places and objects in the physical world. In\nthis work, it is set out an intelligent meeting room,\nfocusing specially on users (such as Alice) predefined\nprofiles, and showing how broker and agents\ncooperate with the system to make decisions based on\nthe information pointed out by the user but also from\ninferred data from user profiles and the context of the\nmeeting. User profiles define a set of rules and\nconstraints, which tells the broker what user\ninformation can be share with the context, and what\ninformation from the context should arrive to the user.\n\n4.3 Context Retrieval\nContext-aware retrieval (CAR) is an extension of\nclassic Information Retrieval (IR) that adds contextual\ninformation in the retrieval process, with the purpose\n\n\fJOURNAL OF COMPUTING, VOLUME 2, ISSUE 5, MAY 2010, ISSN 2151-9617\nHTTPS://SITES.GOOGLE.COM/SITE/JOURNALOFCOMPUTING/\nWWW.JOURNALOFCOMPUTING.ORG\n\nof deliver relevant information to users in a current\ncontext [11].\nGiven that user's profiles take an important part in the\ncontext, information contained there results very\nsuitable as a first filter of useful information. A basic\nprofile allows to capture some information about the\nlanguage, age, sometimes education level and\nprobably something about family composition. More\ncomplete profiles include also information about\ninteresting subjects for the user, careers, and current\nand past research and study areas.\nEven though profile information results very useful,\nin many cases it lacks of completeness and thus its\nutility results limited. In the field of digital libraries, it\nis priority to offer to users access to documents\nrelated to their subjects of interest (journal articles,\ncongress proceedings, books or book chapters, theses).\nThe information that the user explicitly delivers to the\nsystem must be extended to achieve a higher quality\nservice. It is specially important to detect users' needs\neven if the user has not requested them. This\napproximation does not depend on a particular\ndomain, but can be adapted to any other domain since\nit is just a generic way to interact and access\ninformation.\nIn these days where information flows everywhere\nand users receive tons of newsletters, advertising or\nemails everyday, it gets highly important to show\nonly relevant information to the users and to avoid\nsending useless information. This is the reason why it\nis so important to make the user profile as complete as\npossible, identifying real areas of interest. In this sense\nit\nturns\nabsolutely\nnecessary\nto\ndevelop\ncommunication strategies that highlight to the user\nthe importance of complete as much as possible its\nown profile in order to help the system to be really\naccurate.\n\n10\n\nA context-aware application capable of semiautomatically retrieve user information must be able\nto detect these kind of context changes and update\nobjects as long as changes happen.\n\n4.4 Information sources\nAs mentioned above, user profile is one of the main\ninformation sources, but it is definitely not the only\none. Next there is a list of some possible useful\ninformation sources to make user profiles more\ncomplete:\nResearch/work group and role inside that group\nAll research groups have some kind of structure\nwhich may include a director, main researchers, PhD\nstudents, technical team and support team. Thus\ninformation given to each member of a group will\ndepend not only on the research subject but also on\nthe role inside the group. For instance, a main\nresearcher with a team of scholarships may need\naccess to information from himself but also from his\nteam; but every member of that team may not be\nauthorized to see other members' information.\nSelected and/or downloaded documents\nDigital Libraries usually let their users create a set of\nfolders to store documents they consider somehow\nrelevant. These documents, which belong to the\nlibrary collection, are extremely useful to understand\nwhat the user is looking for or studying: a good\ncataloging will enable the system compare inside the\nlibrary thesaurus and detect additional similar\ndocuments.\n\nContext changes and therefore context updates User's queries\nrepresent another problem to CAR systems.\nApplication context in the scope of DL can vary from Digital Libraries websites, and in particular SeDiCI\nat least two places:\nwebsite, permit many mechanisms to access digital\ndocuments. There always exists some kind of on-line\no users research and development search form with a set of filters, which can be a simple\nsubjects may get more specific, may open search expression or even a wide set of very specific\nto a wider subject in the same area, or options. SeDiCI use a combination of both\nmay even turn towards another direction approximations: users can enter a text-free expression,\nand they can also add as many filters as they need\ndifferent from the current working line;\nfrom a growing set of more than 50 so far. Users can\no in some areas, changes and advances also specify whether they want documents from a\nin the research can make information specific collection (only theses, journal papers, etc).\noutdated and obsolete, requiring its Documents retrieved via OAI PMH are also\nreplacement for something newer.\n\n\f11\n\nJOURNAL OF COMPUTING, VOLUME 2, ISSUE 5, MAY 2010, ISSN 2151-9617\nHTTPS://SITES.GOOGLE.COM/SITE/JOURNALOFCOMPUTING/\nWWW.JOURNALOFCOMPUTING.ORG\n\ndistinguished from those that belong to the\nintellectual creation of UNLP (external documents).\nSearch features mentioned above are similar to most\nsearch engines, and their behavior can be compared to\nmost On-line Public Access Catalog (OPAC) because\nof its advanced search options and complex filters.\nSeDiCI users can also access all documents via the\nExploration feature, where resources are classified and\nlisted in sets, according to different criteria:\no\nSubject and sub-subjects.\no\nDocument Type (theses, paper,\ndissertation...).\no\nDegree, in case of theses (PhD,\nmaster, bachelor, specialist).\no\nRepository (for external documents).\nInformation from explicit searches performed by\nusers, as well as implicit searches (virtual tour), are\nvery useful to infer and complete profiles: it is\npossible to know which areas users have surfed, what\nkind of documents they have looked for, or which\nworld repositories they have been interested in.\nCrossing profile information\nThis technique is currently used in many fields, such\nus on-line shopping. The idea is to compare profiles\nand try yo detect similar behavior patterns (visitors\nthat bought that product were also interested in these\nproducts). If a user profile indicates that the user has\nselected or downloaded many articles from some\njournal written by some author, the system could offer\nto another user interested in a similar area these\ndocuments as additional resources.\nThis idea presents new challenges, in particular about\nhow the context is designed and represented:\n\uf0b7 When is an area or subject compatible with\nanother? Knowledge areas usually overlap,\nand its organization is not always a top-down\nhierarchy. A graph structure is probably a\nbetter solution, connected with relationships\nsuch as is-sub-area-of or is-related-to, and\nprobably a list of rules or steps to identify\nwhen an area is said to be compatible with\nanother. Again, the use of ontologies to\nrepresent this information seems to be a\nviable alternative.\n\uf0b7 When is a document from the same author\nrelevant? Many researchers have lots of works\n\n\uf0b7\n\nand papers, but not necessary in the same\narea or with the same importance. Besides,\nsome works might be similar or present\nrepeated information.\nHow to sort documents in an appropriate\nhierarchy and show the most relevant ones? A\nsingle information cross may throw hundreds\nor thousands of possible options. There\nshould exist some method to sort and filter\ndocuments in order to deliver only relevant\nresults: if the user receives more information\nthan he can handle, he will definitely loose\ninterest.\n\n5. CONCLUSIONS\nInside SeDiCI users may find basically two main\ndocuments sets: those that belong to UNLP\nintellectual creation, and those retrieved from\ninstitutional repositories. While the amount of local\nresources is about few thousands (currently about 10\nthousand), external resources are incremented much\nfaster every year: about 300 thousand in 2004, almost\n700 thousand in 2006, 3.5 million in 2008 and more\nthan 10 million currently. This growth shows by itself\nhow dynamic the repository can be, and how\nimportant is to keep students, professors and\nresearchers up-to-date about new additions.\nMoreover, SeDiCI offers services to other UNLP\nlibraries as mentioned above, allowing them to\nintegrate SeDiCI resources to their own in search\nresults[12]. This means that there exist at least to\nclasses of users: local users and UNLP libraries -and\ntheir own users.\nOn one hand SeDiCI users have at least one profile,\nand probably use one or more SeDiCI services. The\nactivity of these users in the website is relatively\nreduced, since in general they search something, find\nthe information they need, download the files and\nthen carry on with their lives. SeDiCI could capture\nthis behavior add information to the context.\nOn the other hand, UNLP libraries do not have a\npredefined profile. Instead, they request resources to\nSeDiCI through web services, according to certain\ncriteria. The lack of profile can be overcome by the\npermanent and very active interaction of these\nwebsites and SeDiCI. This way, it is possible to\ncharacterize libraries profiles with contextual\ninformation, from queries launched from their own\nusers against SeDiCI.\n\n\fJOURNAL OF COMPUTING, VOLUME 2, ISSUE 5, MAY 2010, ISSN 2151-9617\nHTTPS://SITES.GOOGLE.COM/SITE/JOURNALOFCOMPUTING/\nWWW.JOURNALOFCOMPUTING.ORG\n\nT.
