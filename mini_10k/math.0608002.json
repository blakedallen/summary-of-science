In this paper we compute the Hausdorff dimension of\nthe set D(\u03c6n ) of points on divergent trajectories of the homogeneous flow \u03c6n induced by the one-parameter subgroup diag(et , e\u2212t )\nacting by left multiplication on the product space Gn /\u0393n , where\nG = SL(2, R) and \u0393 = SL(2, Z). We prove that dimH D(\u03c6n ) =\n3n \u2212 12 for n \u2265 2.\n\n1. Introduction\nLet G = SL(2, R) be the special linear group of two-by-two matrices\nwith real entries and determinant one and let \u0393 = SL(2, Z) be the\ndiscrete subgroup formed by those with integer entries. Let G(n) =\nG1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Gn where Gi = G, \u0393(n) = \u03931 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 \u0393n where \u0393i = \u0393, and\nconsider the noncompact homogeneous space\nG(n)/\u0393(n) = (G1 /\u03931 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 (Gn /\u0393n )\n\nand the flow induced by the one-parameter subgroup \u03c6n : R \u2192 G(n),\n\u0012 t/2\n\u0013\ne\n0\nt \u2192 (gt , . . . , gt ) where gt =\n,\n0 e\u2212t/2\n\nacting by left multiplication. The forward trajectory (xt )t\u22650 of a point\nx \u2208 G(n)/\u0393(n) is said to be divergent if it eventually leaves every\ncompact set, i.e. for any compact subset K \u2282 G(n)/\u0393(n) there is a\ntime T such that xt 6\u2208 K for all t > T . Let\nD(\u03c6n ) := {x \u2208 G(n)/\u0393(n) : xt \u2192 \u221e\n\nas\n\nt \u2192 \u221e}\n\nbe the set of points whose forward trajectories are divergent; we note\nthat D(\u03c6n ) is the union of all forward divergent trajectories of \u03c6n .

For any n \u2265 2, dimH D(\u03c6n ) = dim G(n) \u2212 21 .\nTheorem 1.1 was motivated by certain analogies between partially\nhyperbolic homogeneous flows on finite volume noncompact spaces and\nthe Teichm\u00fcller flow on moduli spaces of holomorphic quadratic differentials. The Teichm\u00fcller flow can be defined as the restriction to the\ndiagonal subgroup (\u03c6t ) of a certain action of SL(2, R) on moduli space.\nIn this context, Masur [Ma] showed that for any SL(2, R)-orbit X the\nHausdorff dimension of the set of points on divergent trajectories of the\nTeichm\u00fcller flow is at most 12 ; moreover, for a generic SL(2, R)-orbit,\nit was shown by Masur-Smillie [MS] that the Hausdorff dimension is in\nfact positive.\nFor any partially hyperbolic homogeneous flow \u03c6 on a finite volume\nnoncompact homogeneous space, Dani [Da] showed that the set D(\u03c6)\ncontains a countable union of submanifolds of positive codimension that\nconsists of points lying on degenerate divergent trajectories. Moreover,\nhe showed that in the case of R-rank one, all divergent trajectories are\ndegenerate, while in the higher rank situation there are nondegenerate\ndivergent trajectories. (See also [We] for related questions pertaining\nto the notion of degeneracy.) Theorem 1.1 shows that in the case\nof \u03c6n for n \u2265 2 the set of points that lie on degenerate divergent\ntrajectories form a subset of D(\u03c6n ) of positive Hausdorff codimension,\nsupporting the idea that nondegenerate divergent trajectories are more\nabundant than degenerate ones. We also note that for n = 1, we have\ndimH D(\u03c61 ) = dim G \u2212 1 = 2.\nFor further results concerning the trajectories (bounded or divergent)\nof partially hyperbolic homogeneous flows and their applications to\nnumber theory we refer the reader to [Bu], [Kl], [KM], [St], and [We].\nTo obtain the upper bound in Theorem 1.1 we shall in fact show\nthat for some sufficiently large compact set K \u2282 G(n)/\u0393(n) the points\nwhose forward trajectory under eventually stays outside K form a set\nS = S(K) of positive Hausdorff codimension. The compact set will\ndepend on a parameter \u03b4 > 0 such that the upper bound on dimH S(K)\ntends to 3n \u2212 21 as \u03b4 \u2192 0.\nOutline. In \u00a72, we use standard methods to reduce the computation\nof the Hausdorff dimension of D(\u03c6n ) to that of the set En\u2217 of endpoints\nof nondegenerate divergent trajectories. The set En\u2217 may naturally be\nthought of as a subset of Rn and in \u00a73 we give a characterisation of this\nset in terms of an encoding that uses continued fractions. Using this\n\n\fHAUSDORFF DIMENSION FOR DIVERGENCE IN A PRODUCT SPACE\n\n3\n\nencoding, we compute the lower bound on dimH D(\u03c6n ) in \u00a74. Then\nwe introduce the notion of a self-similar covering in \u00a75 as a convenient\ndevice for presenting the upper bound calculation, which is presented\nin \u00a76.\nAcknowledgments.

Endpoints of divergent trajectories\nIn this section we consider the set of endpoints of divergent trajectories and identify it with a subset of Rn . We assume the notation\nalready established in the introduction.\nIdeal boundary and Bruhat decomposition. The forward trajectories of two points in G(n) are asymptotic if and only if they belong\nto the same right coset of the parabolic subgroup P (n) = P1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pn\nwhere Pi = P for i = 1, . . . , n and\nP = {p \u2208 G : gt pg\u2212t stays bounded as t \u2192 \u221e}.\nThus, the set D(\u03c6n ) is a union of right cosets of P (n).\nThe ideal boundary, whose points are asymptotic classes of trajectories of \u03c6n , is represented by the right coset space\nP (n)\\G(n) = (P1 \\G1 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 (Pn \\Gn ).\nThe unipotent radicals of P and P (n) are respectively given by\nN = {u \u2208 G : gt ug\u2212t \u2192 e as t \u2192 \u221e}\nand N(n) = N1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Nn where Ni = N. The Bruhat decomposition\nestablishes a one-to-one correspondence between right cosets of P (n)\nthat differ from P (n) itself with elements of N(n):\n[\nG(n) \u2212 P (n) =\nP (n)wu\nu\u2208N (n)\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0 \u22121\nwhere w = (w1 , . . . , wn ) and wi =\nfor i = 1, . . . , n. Let En\n1 0\nbe the subset of N(n) such that\n[\nP (n)wu.\n(D(\u03c6n ) \u2212 P (n)) =\nu\u2208En\n\n\f4\n\nYITWAH CHEUNG\n\nRational points. A right coset of Pi is a \u0393i -rational point if its\nstabiliser under the action of Gi by right multiplication contains a\nmaximal parabolic subgroup of \u0393i . Similarly, a right coset of P (n)\nis \u0393(n)-rational if its stabiliser under the G(n) action on P (n)\\G(n)\ncontains a maximal parabolic subgroup of \u0393(n). We note that P (n)\nis a \u0393(n)-rational point and also that the set of \u0393(n)-rational points\nforms a single orbit under the action of \u0393(n) on P (n)\\G(n) by right\nmultiplication.\nWe shall say a right coset of the form P (n)wu is rational in the ith coordinate if its stabiliser under the action of G(n) on P (n)\\G(n) contains\nthe subgroup of G(n) consisting of elements of the form (x1 , . . . , xn )\nwhere xj is the identity of Gj for j 6= i and xi \u2208 Pi . Note that P (n)wu\nis \u0393(n)-rational if and only if it is rational in the ith coordinate for\ni = 1, . . . , n. We say P (n)wu is totally irrational if it is not rational in\nthe ith coordinate for any i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}. Let En\u2032 be the set of points\nin En corresponding to right cosets of P (n) that a totally irrational.\nWe shall identify N(n) with Rn and En\u2032 with the corresponding subset of Rn . Since dim P (n) = 2n, the product formula for Hausdorff\ndimension (see (2) in \u00a74) gives\ndimH (P (n)En\u2032 ) = 2n + dimH En\u2032 .\n\nSince D(\u03c6n ) \u2212 P (n)En\u2032 is contained in a countable union of submanifolds of G(n) of dimension strictly less than dim G(n), its Hausdorff\ndimension is bounded above by 3n\u22121 (see Lemma 5.4 in \u00a75.) Therefore,\nthe proof of Theorem 1.1 reduces to the statement\n1\nfor n \u2265 2.\n2\nThe identification of N(n) with Rn can be made explicit as follows.\nThe action of G on the upper half plane H2 = {z \u2208 C : Im z > 0} by\nM\u00f6bius transformations extends continuously to the boundary R\u222a{\u221e};\nwe assume this action is given as a right action. The boundary is naturally identified with P \\G such that the right coset P corresponds\nto the ideal point \u221e. Similarly, the group G(n) acts on the product\nspace (H2 )n and the ideal boundary P (n)\\G(n) is naturally identified with the topological boundary of (H2 )n as a subset of (\u0108)n where\n\u0108 = C \u222a {\u221e}. Under this identification, the set of right cosets of the\nform P (n)wu with u \u2208 N(n) corresponds to the subset Rn \u2282 (\u0108)n .\nMoreover, a right coset is \u0393(n)-rational (resp. rational in the ith coordinate) if and only if every coordinate (resp. the ith coordinate) of\nthe corresponding point in Rn is rational. It is totally irrational if and\nonly if every coordinate of the corresponding point in Rn is irrational.\ndimH En\u2032 = n \u2212\n\n\fHAUSDORFF DIMENSION FOR DIVERGENCE IN A PRODUCT SPACE\n\n5\n\n3. Encoding via piecewise linear functions\nIn this section we associate a piecewise linear function Wx : R \u2192 R\nto every x \u2208 Rn and use it to characterise the set En\u2032 .\nWe shall draw freely upon the standard results of continued fraction\ntheory. All the results we use can be found in [Kh].\nFor any x \u2208 R, let Wx : R \u2192 R be the piecewise linear function\ndetermined by the conditions\n(1) The function Wx is continuous and nonnegative,\n(2) has slopes \u00b11 whenever defined,\n(3) each local minimum of Wx is a zero, and\n(4) the zeroes of Wx are enumerated by (2 log qk ) where (qk ) is the\nsequence of heights formed by the convergents of x.\n(Recall that the height of a rational is the smallest positive integer that\nmultiplies it into the integers.)\nIt is well-known that an integer q is the height of a convergent of x if\nand only if the distance of qx to the nearest integer is minimal among\nthe set of integer multiples x, 2x, . . . , qx. The function Wx (t) is broken\nat a finite number of points if and only if x is rational.\nFor any nonempty closed discrete subset Z of R2 we define\nl\u221e (Z) := min{max(|a|, |b|) : (a, b) \u2208 Z, (a, b) 6= (0, 0)}\n\nto be the length of the shortest nonzero vector in Z\nsup norm.

For any nonempty closed discrete subset Z \u2282 R2 the function\nW (t) = \u22122 log l\u221e (gt Z)\n\nis a continuous piecewise linear function with slopes \u00b11 and isolated\n2\ncritical points, and in particular, for the set Z = h\u22121\nx Z . Observe that\nW (t) has constant slope \u22121 for all t < 0 since the shortest nonzero\nvector in gt Z is realised by (1, 0).\nSuppose that W (t) has a local minimum at a time t \u2265 0. Then\nthere is a pair of vectors v, v \u2032 \u2208 Z and a square S centered at the\norigin containing gt v on one of its vertical edges and gt v \u2032 on one of its\nhorizontal edges such that S contains no nonzero vectors of gt Z in its\n\n\f6\n\nYITWAH CHEUNG\n\ninterior. The vectors have the form v = (qx\u2212p, q) and v \u2032 = (q \u2032 x\u2212p\u2032 , q \u2032)\nfor some p, q, p\u2032 , q \u2032 \u2208 Z and we may assume that q \u2265 0, q \u2032 \u2265 1, and if\nq \u2032 = 1 then p\u2032 can be chosen so that |q \u2032 x \u2212 p\u2032 | \u2264 1/2. The side of the\nsquare is\n2e\u2212W (t)/2 = 2et/2 |qx \u2212 p| = 2e\u2212t/2 q \u2032 .\nBy Minkowski's theorem, the area of the square is at most 4 so that\ne\u2212W (t) = q \u2032 |qx \u2212 p| \u2264 1\n\nfrom which it follows that |qx\u2212p| \u2264 1/2, i.e. the distance to the nearest\ninteger ||qx|| = |qx \u2212 p|. Since g\u2212t S contains no nonzero vectors of Z\nin its interior, it follows that q \u2032 is the height of some convergent of x.\nThe corresponding zero of Wx (t) occurs at time 2 log q \u2032 so that\nW (t) \u2212 Wx (2 log q \u2032 ) = \u2212 log q \u2032 ||qx|| = t \u2212 2 log q \u2032 .\n\nSince q \u2264 q \u2032 and |q \u2032 x \u2212 p\u2032 | \u2264 |qx \u2212 p|, the area of the parallelogram\nspanned by v and v \u2032 is at most 2q \u2032||qx||; and since Z is a unimodular\nlattice, the area is at least one. Therefore, each local minimum of\nWx (t) is shifted upwards and to the right relative to a zero of W (t) by\nan equal amount of at most log 2 in both directions.\nConversely, given any zero of W (t), occuring at time 2 log q, there\nis a convergent p/q of x such that (qx \u2212 p, q) \u2208 Z lies on the top of\na rectangle R symmetric with respect to the origin and whose interior\ncontains no nonzero vectors of Z. We may assume R is chosen largest\npossible so that it contains a point of Z on one of its vertical edges.\nSince its horizontal are vertical sides are respectively at most one and\nat least one, there is a (unique) time t \u2265 0 when gt R is a square and\nW (t) has a local minimum at this time.\nIt follows easily that\nWx (t) \u2264 W (t) \u2264 Wx (t) + 2 log 2\n\nso that the statement of the theorem holds with C = 2 log 2.\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 1. The encoding of geodesics on the modular surface is wellknown and dates back to E. Artin [Ar]. Theorem 3.1 may be thought of\nas a refinement of this encoding that also involves the parametrisation\nof the geodesics.\nRemark 2. The set of oriented unimodular lattices in R2 may naturally be identified with G/\u0393 and the function \u22122 log l2 (Z), where l2 (Z)\ndenotes the Euclidean norm of the shortest nonzero vector in Z, lifts\nto a K-invariant proper function on G/\u0393. The induced function on the\nhyperbolic triangle\n\u2206 := {z : Im z > 0, |Re z| \u2264 1/2, |z| \u2265 1}\n\n\fHAUSDORFF DIMENSION FOR DIVERGENCE IN A PRODUCT SPACE\n\n7\n\ncoincides with the function z \u2192 Im z.\nFor any x \u2208 Rn we let Wx (t) : R \u2192 R be the function given by\nWx (t) = max(Wx1 (t), . . . , Wxn (t)).\n\nNote that Wx (t) has infinitely many local minima if and only if every\ncoordinate of x is irrational. It follows by Mahler's criterion and Theorem 3.1 that x \u2208 En if and only if Wx (t) \u2192 \u221e as t \u2192 \u221e, which in\nturn holds if and only if\nWx (tj ) \u2192 \u221e as j \u2192 \u221e\n\nwhere (tj ) is the sequence of local minimum times. In particular, if\n(qk ) and (ql\u2032 ) are the sequences of heights formed by the convergents of\nirrationals x and y, respectively, then (x, y) \u2208 E2\u2032 if and only if\n| log(qk /ql\u2032 )| \u2192 \u221e as\n\nmin(qk , ql\u2032) \u2192 \u221e;\n\nin other words, for any \u03c1 > 1 there exists R > 1 such that for any\nindices k, l such that qk > R and ql\u2032 > R, we have\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u2032\nql qk\n,\n> \u03c1.\nmax\nqk ql\u2032\n4. Lower bound calculation\nIn this section we prove that dimH En\u2032 \u2265 n \u2212 12 for n \u2265 2. We begin\nby recalling some results that we need for this calculation.\nHausdorff dimension estimates. Consider a Cantor set F \u2282 R\ndefined as a nested intersection\n\\\nF =\nFj\nj\u22650\n\nwhere F0 is a closed interval and each Fj is a disjoint union of (finitely)\nmany closed intervals. Let (mj )j\u22651 be a sequence of positive integers\nand (\u03b5j )j\u22651 a sequence of real numbers that tend to zero monotonically\nand suppose that for each j \u2265 1 there are at least mj intervals of Fj\ncontained in each interval of Fj\u22121 and these intervals are separated by\ngaps of length at least \u03b5j . Then the Hausdorff dimension of F satisfies\nthe lower bound (see [Fa], Example 4.6)\n(1)\n\ndimH F \u2265 lim sup\nj\u2192\u221e\n\nlog(m1 * * * mj\u22121 )\n.\n\u2212 log mj \u01ebj\n\nThe following product formula (see [Fa], Corollary 7.4) holds for\nsubsets E \u2282 Rn and F \u2282 Rm ,\n(2)\n\ndimH (E \u00d7 F ) = dimH E + dimH F\n\n\f8\n\nYITWAH CHEUNG\n\nas soon as the Hausdorff and Minkowski dimensions of one of the sets\ncoincide. Thus, it is enough to prove dimH E2\u2032 \u2265 23 .\nWe shall also need the following result.\nLemma 4.1. ([Fa], Corollary 7.12) Let F \u2282 R2 and E its projection\nto the x-axis. For each x \u2208 E, let Lx be the line {(x, y) : y \u2208 R}. If\ndimH (F \u2229 Lx ) \u2265 t for all x \u2208 E then\ndimH F \u2265 t + dimH E.\nCounting rationals. We shall also need the following result.\nTheorem 4.2. ([Ch1], Theorem 2) There is a constant c > 0 such\nthat for any interval I of the form I = [x \u2212 d, x + d] and for any\nh > 0 the number of rationals in I whose height lies between h and 2h\nis at least ch2 |I| provided x has a convergent whose height q satisfies\n(hd)\u22121 \u2264 q \u2264 h.\nRemark. Theorem 2 in [Ch1] is stated under an addititonal technical\nhypothesis that can be shown to be redundant and has therefore been\nomitted here. See [Ch2] for other variations and improvements.\nWe now show that dimH E2\u2032 \u2265 32 . The proof of the next lemma will\nbe omitted, since it is essentially contained in the proof of a classical\nresult of Jarnik-Besicovitch.\nLemma 4.3. Let A\u03b4 be the set of irrationals with the property that the\nsequence (qk ) of heights formed by its convergents satisfy\n(3)\n\nqk1+\u03b4 \u2264 qk+1 \u2264 2qk1+\u03b4\n\nfor k large enough. Then dimH A\u03b4 \u2265\n\n1\n2+\u03b4\n\nfor any \u03b4 > 0.\n\nLemma 4.4. Let Bx be the set of y \u2208 R such that (x, y) \u2208 E2\u2032 . Then\ndimH Bx = 1 for any x \u2208 A\u03b4 .\nProof. Let (qk ) be the sequence of heights formed by the convergents\nof some given x \u2208 A\u03b4 and fix k0 such that (3) holds for all k \u2265 k0 . We\nshall choose k0 \u226b 1 so that certain estimates that arise in the course\nof the proof will hold. Our goal is to construct a set of y \u2208 Bx with the\nproperty that for each k \u2265 k0 there is a pair of consecutive convergents\nof y whose heights q < q \u2032 satisfy (up to a constant factor)\n\u0012 \u2032\n\u0013\nq qk\nmin\n> log qk .\n,\nqk q\n\n\fHAUSDORFF DIMENSION FOR DIVERGENCE IN A PRODUCT SPACE\n\n9\n\nThis set will be realised as a decreasing intersection \u2229Fj where each Fj\nis a disjoint union of closed intervals. Let us fix the following parameters for the construction:\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n1\nqk0 +j\n, \u03b5j = 2 , and dj = 2\nhj =\nlog qk0 +j\n8hj\nqk0 +j\nwhere [*] denotes the greatest integer function. The intervals of Fj will\nall have length 2dj and the length of the gap between any two of them\nwill be at least \u03b5j ; moreover we shall also require each interval of Fj to\nbe centered about a rational whose height is between hj and 2hj .\nLet F0 be an interval of length 2d0 centered about a rational of height\nh0 . Given Fj we shall define Fj+1 by specifying, for each interval I of\nFj , the intervals of Fj+1 that are contained in I. Let J be an interval\nof Fj where j \u2265 0. By the induction hypothesis, J is of the form\n\u0014\n\u0015\np\np\nJ=\n\u2212 dj , + dj\nq\nq\nwhere p/q is a rational whose height q is between hj and 2hj . Note\nthat by construction, every x \u2208 J has p/q as a convergent since\nx\u2212\n\n(4)\n\np\n1\n1\n1\n\u2264 dj = 2\n\u2264 2 \u2264 2\nq\nqk0 +j\n8hj\n2q\n\nwhere in the third step we used k0 \u226b 1. Moreover, if q \u2032 is the height\nof the next convergent then\n1\np\n1\n< \u2032.\n< x\u2212\n\u2032\n2qq\nq\nqq\n\n(5)\n\nLet I be the interval of length\n\ndj\n3\n\nx\u2032 =\n\ncentered about\np dj\n+\nq\n2\n\nand note that an interval of length 2dj+1 centered about any point in\nI is entirely contained in J provided k0 \u226b 1. The interval I is of the\nd\nform [x\u2032 \u2212 d, x\u2032 + d] where d = 6j and the first inequality in (5) implies\nq\u2032 >\n\n(6)\n\n1\n1\n\u2265\n> (hj+1 d)\u22121\n2qdj\n4hj dj\n\nassuming k0 \u226b 1. For any point y \u2208 I the distance to p/q is at least\ndj\nso that the second inequality in (5) implies\n3\nq\u2032 <\n\n3qk20 +j\nqk0 +j+1\n3\n\u2264\n< 6qk0 +j log qk0 +j <\n\u2264 hj+1\ndj q\nhj\nlog qk0 +j+1\n\n\f10\n\nYITWAH CHEUNG\n\nwhere in the fourth step we used k0 \u226b 1 again. Thus, Theorem 4.2\napplied to the interval I implies there are at least\nmj+1 = (c/3)h2j+1dj\nrationals in I with heights between hj+1 and 2hj+1. We define the\nintervals of Fj+1 contained in J to be any closed interval of length\n2dj+1 centered about a rational just constructed and let F = \u2229Fj be\nthe resulting Cantor set.\nNow we compute the Hausdorff dimension of F . The distance between the centers of two intervals of Fj is at least 2\u03b5j because the height\nthe rationals at the centers are both at most 2hj . Since 2dj < \u03b5j , the\nlength of the gap between any two intervals of Fj is at least \u03b5j . Before\napplying the formula (1), we need to develop some estimates on the\nparameters of the construction. From (3) we have\n(1+\u03b4)j\n\nqk0\n\n(1+\u03b4)j\n\n\u2264 qk0 +j \u2264 2j qk0\n\nso that\nlog qk0 +j = (1 + \u03b4)j log qk0 + O(j).\nLet us write A \u224d B if we have A/C \u2264 B \u2264 AC for some explicitly\ncomputable C > 0 whose value is otherwise irrelevant for the purposes\nof this calculation. Then, using (3) again, we have\nmj+1 \u224d h2j+1 dj \u224d\n\nqk2\u03b40 +j\n(log qk0 +j+1 )2\n\nso that\nlog mj+1 = 2\u03b4(1 + \u03b4)j log qk0 + O(j).\nTherefore,\nlog(m1 * * * mj ) =\n\nj\u22121\nX\n\n2\u03b4 log(1 + \u03b4)i log qk0 + O(j 2)\n\ni=0\n\n= 2(1 + \u03b4)j log qk0 + O(j 2 )\nand since mj+1 \u03b5j+1 \u224d dj we have\n\n\u2212 log mj+1 \u03b5j+1 = 2(1 + \u03b4)j log qk0 + O(j)\n\nso that the formula (1) yields dimH F = 1.\nIt remains to show that F \u2282 Bx . Given any y \u2208 F = \u2229Fj and any\nk = k0 + j for some j \u2265 0 we let p/q be the rational at the center of\n\n\fHAUSDORFF DIMENSION FOR DIVERGENCE IN A PRODUCT SPACE\n\n11\n\nthe interval J of Fj that contains y. Since y \u2208 J, (4) implies p/q is a\nconvergent of y whose height q satisfies\nq < 2hj <\n\n2qk\n.\nlog qk\n\nNow let I \u2282 J be the interval of Fj+1 that contains y. Since y \u2208 I, the\nfirst two inequalities in (6) imply\nq\u2032 >\n\nqk log qk\n1\n>\n4hj dj\n4\n\nfrom which it follows that (x, y) \u2208 E2\u2032 . Therefore, F \u2282 Bx and the\nlemma follows.\n\u0003\nLemmas 4.1, 4.3 and 4.4 now imply that dimH E2\u2032 \u2265 23 .\n5. Self-similar coverings\nThe main technical device for obtaining upper bounds on Hausdorff\ndimension is the notion of a self-similar covering.\nDefinition 5.1. Let B be a countable covering of a subset E \u2282 Rn by\nbounded subsets of Rn and let \u03c3 be a function from the set B to the set\nof all nonempty subsets of B. We say (B, \u03c3) is a self-similar covering\nof E if there exists \u03bb, 0 < \u03bb < 1 such that for every x \u2208 E there is a\nsequence Bj of elements in B satisfying\n(1) \u2229Bj = {x},\n(2) diam Bj+1 < \u03bb diam Bj for all j, and\n(3) Bj+1 \u2208 \u03c3(Bj ) for all j.\nWe shall need a slightly more general notion which is notationally\nmore cumbersome but offers added flexibility in applications.\nDefinition 5.2. Let B be a countable covering of a subset E \u2282 Rn by\nbounded subsets of Rn and assume that it is indexed by some countable\nset J; let \u03c3 be a function from the set J to the set of all nonempty\nsubsets of J. For any \u03b1 \u2208 J we write B(\u03b1) for the element of B\nindexed by \u03b1. We say (B, J, \u03c3) is an indexed self-similar covering of\nE (the indexing function \u03b9 : J \u2192 B being implicit) if there exists a\n\u03bb, 0 < \u03bb < 1 such that for every x \u2208 E we have a sequence (\u03b1j ) of\nelements in J satisfying\n(1) \u2229B(\u03b1j ) = {x},\n(2) diam B(\u03b1j+1 ) < \u03bb diam B(\u03b1j ) for all j, and\n(3) \u03b1j+1 \u2208 \u03c3(\u03b1j ) for all j.\n\n\f12\n\nYITWAH CHEUNG\n\nRemark. We shall carry out the calculations using self-similar coverings by indexed families of sets. Although the calculations can also\nbe done using ordinary self-similar coverings, the advantage of using\nindexed families will become clear, especially in the case n > 2.\nThe goal of this section is to prove the following.\nTheorem 5.3. Let (B, J, \u03c3) be an indexed self-similar covering of a\nsubset E \u2282 Rn and suppose there is an s > 0 such that for every \u03b1 \u2208 J\n(7)\n\nX\n\n\u03b1\u2032 \u2208\u03c3(\u03b1)\n\n(diam B(\u03b1\u2032 ))s \u2264 (diam B(\u03b1))s .\n\nThen dimH E \u2264 s.\n\nFor the convenience of the reader, we briefly recall the definition of\nthe Hausdorff dimension of a subset E \u2282 Rn . A countable covering U\nof a set E \u2282 Rn is said to be an \u03b5-cover if the diameter of each element\nis less than \u03b5. Given an \u03b5-cover U, we let \u03bcs (U) denote the sum of the\nsth powers of the diameters of the elements in U, and set\n\u03bcs\u03b5 (E) = inf {\u03bcs (U) : U is an \u03b5-cover of E } .\n\nThe s-dimensional measure of E is defined as the limit\n\u03bcs (E) := lim+ \u03bcs\u03b5 (E)\n\u03b5\u21920\n\nwhich as a function of s \u2265 0 has a critical value h \u2265 0 with the property\n\u03bcs (E) = \u221e for all s < h while \u03bcs (E) = 0 for all s > h. This value may\nbe taken as the definition of the Hausdorff dimension of E.\nThe following is a basic property enjoyed by Hausdorff dimension.\nLemma 5.4. ([Bi], Theorem 4.1) For any countable collection {Ej } of\nsubsets of Rn ,\ndimH (\u222aEj ) = sup dimH Ej .\nProof of Theorem 5.3. For each x \u2208 E we have a sequence of elements\nin J satisfying 1.-3. in the definition of a self-similar covering; we shall\nthink of this sequence as an infinite word w(x) in a language over the\nalphabet J. If w(x) = (\u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . . ) then we say (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1k ) is a prefix\nof w(x) of length k. Let T be the collection of words formed by all\npossible prefixes of w(x) as x ranges over E. For any w \u2208 T , let Ew\nbe the subset of E formed by those x for which theSinfinite word w(x)\nhas w as a prefix. Since T is countable and E = w\u2208T Ew it suffices\nto show that dimH Ew \u2264 s for every w \u2208 T . For w \u2208 T we shall also\nwrite B(w) for the element of B indexed by the last letter of w.\nFix w \u2208 T and consider any \u03b5 > 0 with \u03b5 < diam B(w). For each\nx \u2208 Ew , let j(x) be the smallest integer j such that diam B(\u03b1j (x)) < \u03b5\n\n\fHAUSDORFF DIMENSION FOR DIVERGENCE IN A PRODUCT SPACE\n\n13\n\nand let w \u2032 (x) be the prefix of w(x) of length j(x). Let A \u2282 T be the\nset of all w \u2032 (x) as x ranges over Ew . Then U = {B(w \u2032) : w \u2032 \u2208 A} is\nan \u03b5-cover of Ew . We claim that \u03bcs (U) \u2264 (diam B(w))s from which\nit follows that \u03bcs\u03b5 (Ew ) \u2264 (diam B(w))s and since \u03b5 > 0 can be made\narbitrarily small, we have \u03bcs (Ew ) < \u221e so that dimH Ew \u2264 s.\nTo prove the claim, we consider the subset Tw \u2282 T consisting of\nall those words which have w as a prefix. A subset A\u2032 \u2282 Tw is an\nanti-chain if no word in A\u2032 is a prefix of some other word in A\u2032 . By\nconstruction, A is an anti-chain contained in Tw . Hence, the claim is a\nconsequence of the following assertion: for any anti-chain A\u2032 \u2282 Tw\nX\n\n(8)\n\nw \u2032 \u2208A\u2032\n\n(diam B(w \u2032 ))s \u2264 (diam B(w))s .\n\nLet Tk \u2282 Tw be the subset formed by all words of length at most k + l\nwhere l is the length of w. Since T0 = {w}, (8) holds for all A\u2032 \u2282 T0 .\nNow suppose that (8) holds for all anti-chains contained in Tk and\nlet A\u2032 be an anti-chain contained in Tk+1 . Write A\u2032 = A0 \u222a A1 where\nA0 = A\u2229Tk and A1 = A\u2032 \u2212A0 . Let A\u2032\u2032 = A0 \u222a\u03c0(A1 ) where \u03c0 : A1 \u2192 Tk\nis the map that sends w \u2032 to the word \u03c0(w \u2032 ) obtained by dropping the\nlast letter of w \u2032 . Note that A0 \u2229 \u03c0(A1 ) = \u2205 and that A\u2032\u2032 is an anti-chain\ncontained in Tk . If w \u2032 \u2208 \u03c0(A1 ), w \u2032\u2032 \u2208 \u03c0 \u22121 (w \u2032 ), and \u03b1 is the last letter\nof w \u2032, then w \u2032\u2032 is obtained from w \u2032 by adding a suffix \u03b1\u2032 \u2208 \u03c3(\u03b1) where\n\u03b1 is the last letter of w \u2032.

Upper bound calculation\nIn this section we prove the following.\nTheorem 6.1. Let En (\u03b4), \u03b4 > 0 be the set of points x \u2208 Rn satisfying\n(1) every coordinate of x is irrational, and\n(2) Wx (t) > \u2212 log \u03b4 for all sufficiently large t.\nThen for any \u03b4 \u2264 2\u22127 we have\n3\ndimH E2 (\u03b4) \u2264 + 16\u03b4 + O(\u03b4 2 )\n2\nand for n > 2, there are constants \u03b4n > 0 and Cn > 0 such that\n\u221a\n1\ndimH En (\u03b4) \u2264 n \u2212 + Cn \u03b4 + O(\u03b4)\n2\nfor any \u03b4 \u2264 \u03b4n .\nLet 0 < \u03b4 < 1 be fixed. We shall first develop some convenient\nnotation. Let\nQ = {(p, q) \u2208 Z2 : gcd(p, q) = 1, q > 0}\n\nand for any v, w \u2208 Q such that v = (p, q) and w = (p\u2032 , q \u2032 ) set\np\nv\u0307 = , |v| = q, v \u00d7 w = pq \u2032 \u2212 p\u2032 q.\nq\nWe shall introduce two relations \u22a2 and |= on Q as follows. Let C be\nthe collection of sequences v : N \u222a {0} \u2192 Q with the property that\n|v0 | = 1 and for each k \u2265 0,\nvk+1 = avk + vk\u22121\n\nfor some a \u2208 N with the understanding that when k = 0 this holds for\nsome a \u2265 2 and some choice of v\u22121 = \u00b1(1, 0). Define u \u22a2 v if there\nexists a sequence (vk ) \u2208 C and k \u2265 0 such that u = vk and v = vk+1 ;\nsimilarly, define u |= v if there exists a sequence (vk ) \u2208 C, k \u2265 0 and\nl \u2265 0 such that u = vk and v = vk+l .\n\n\fHAUSDORFF DIMENSION FOR DIVERGENCE IN A PRODUCT SPACE\n\n15\n\nIt follows from well-known properties of continued fractions that a\nsequence (vk )k\u22650 in Q belongs to C if and only if (v\u0307k )k\u22650 is the sequence\nof convergents of some irrational number. It is easy to see that |vk | <\n|vk+1| for all k and for any sequence (vk ) in C; in other words the\nsequence of heights formed by the convergents of any real number is\nstrictly increasing. Note also that if u \u22a2 v then |u\u00d7v| = 1 and |u| < |v|.\n6.1. Case n = 2. For any (u, v) \u2208 Q \u00d7 Q, let B(u, v) denote the ball,\n1\nwith respect to the sup metric on R2 , of radius |u||v|\ncentered at the\nrational point (u\u0307, v\u0307). Let B be the collection of balls B(u, v) as (u, v)\nranges over the elements of the set J \u2282 Q \u00d7 Q consisting of all pairs\n(u, v) satisfying either of the mutually exclusive conditions\n|u| < \u03b4|v| or |v| < \u03b4|u|.\n\nGiven (u, v) \u2208 J satisfying |u| < \u03b4|v| we define \u03c3(u, v) to be the subset\nof J consisting of all pairs (u\u2032 , v \u2032) satisfying\nu \u22a2 u\u2032 ,\n\nv |= v \u2032 ,\n\nand |v \u2032 | < \u03b4|u\u2032|;\n\nsimilarly, if |v| < \u03b4|u| we define \u03c3(u, v) to be the subset of J consisting\nof those pairs (u\u2032 , v \u2032) satisfying v \u22a2 v \u2032 , u |= u\u2032 , and |u\u2032 | < \u03b4|v \u2032 |.\nWe now show (B, J, \u03c3) is a self-similar covering of E2 (\u03b4). Given\nx = (x, y) \u2208 E2 (\u03b4) let tj \u2192 \u221e be the sequence of times formed by the\nlocal minima of Wx and choose any j0 such that Wx (tj ) > \u2212 log \u03b4 for\nall j > j0 . Let\n\u03b1j = (uj , vj ) for j > j0\nwhere uj , vj \u2208 Q are defined as follows. The zero of Wx closest to tj is\nof the form 2 log q for some integer q which is the height of a convergent\np/q of x; let uj be the element in Q such that u\u0307j = p/q. Similarly, let\nvj be the element of Q such that v\u0307j is a convergent of y and 2 log |vj |\nis the zero of Wy closest to tj .\nWe claim that for any j > j0\ntj = log(|uj ||vj |) and Wx (tj ) = log\n\n|uj |\n.\n|vj |\n\nSince Wx (tj ) > \u2212 log \u03b4 we either have |uj | < \u03b4|vj | or |vj | < \u03b4|uj |, so\nthat the second part of the claim implies \u03b1j \u2208 J for any j > j0 .\nTo see the claim, let t (resp. t\u2032 ) be the time of the local maximum\nof Wx that immediately precedes (resp. follows) tj , so that\nt < tj < t\u2032 .\nLet z \u2208 {x, y} be the coordinate of x such that Wx (s) = Wz (s) for all\ns \u2208 [t, tj ]; similarly, let z \u2032 be the coordinate of x such that Wx (s) =\n\n\f16\n\nYITWAH CHEUNG\n\nWz \u2032 (s) for all s \u2208 [tj , t\u2032 ]. Then z has a consecutive pair of convergents\nwith heights p < p\u2032 such that\np\u2032\nt = log(pp\u2032 ) and Wx (t) = Wz (t) = log ;\np\n\u2032\nsimilarly, z has a consecutive pair of convergents with heights q < q \u2032\nsuch that\nq\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nt = log(qq ) and Wx (t ) = Wz (t) = log .\nq\n\u2032\nSince Wz (tj ) = 2 log p \u2212tj and Wz \u2032 (tj ) = tj \u22122 log q and both are equal\nto Wx (tj ) we have\np\u2032\n.\nq\nNow Wz (t) > Wz (tj ) implies p < q while Wz \u2032 (t) > Wz \u2032 (tj ) implies\nq < q \u2032 and since Wx (tj ) > \u2212 log \u03b4 > 0 we also have q < p\u2032 so that\naltogether we have the inequalities\ntj = log(p\u2032 q) and Wx (tj ) = log\n\np < q < p\u2032 < q \u2032 .\nSince tj = log(p\u2032 q) and there are no zeroes of Wz lying strictly between\n2 log p and 2 log p\u2032 , it follows that 2 log p\u2032 is the zero of Wz closest to\ntj ; similarly, 2 log q is the zero of Wz \u2032 closest of tj . Moreover, since\np < q < p\u2032 < q \u2032 we cannot have z = z \u2032 so that\neither x = (z, z \u2032 ) or x = (z \u2032 , z).\nIn the first case we have |uj | = p\u2032 and |vj | = q, while in the second case\n|uj | = q and |vj | = p\u2032 ; in both cases, the claim holds.\nNext, we verify that the sequence (\u03b1j )j>j0 satisfies the three conditions in the definition of a self-similar covering. First, we show\nthat x \u2208 B(\u03b1j ) for all j > j0 . Suppose that \u03b1j = (uj , vj ) satisfies\n|uj | < \u03b4|vj |. Let u\u2032j \u2208 Q be the element such that u\u0307\u2032j is the convergent\nof x that immediately follows u\u0307j . Note that\n|vj | < |u\u2032j |\n\nsince tj < t\u2032 where t\u2032 = log(|uj ||u\u2032j |) is the time of the first local maximum of Wx beyond tj . It follows from continued fraction theory that\n1\n1\n|x \u2212 u\u0307j | <\n<\n\u2032\n|uj ||uj |\n|uj ||vj |\nand\n|y \u2212 v\u0307j | <\n\n\u03b4\n1\n<\n2\n|vj |\n|uj ||vj |\n\n\fHAUSDORFF DIMENSION FOR DIVERGENCE IN A PRODUCT SPACE\n\n17\n\nso that x \u2208 B(\u03b1j ), assuming |uj | < \u03b4|vj |. If instead \u03b1j = (uj , vj )\nsatisfies |vj | < \u03b4|uj |, an argument similar to the one just given leads to\nthe same conclusion x \u2208 B(\u03b1j ). Therefore, x \u2208 \u2229j>j0 B(\u03b1j ) and since\ndiam B(\u03b1j ) = 2e\u22122tj \u2192 0 as j \u2192 \u221e it follows that \u2229B(\u03b1j ) = {x},\ngiving the first condition in the definition of a self-similar covering.\nNow we check the second and third conditions. Again, suppose that\n\u03b1j = (uj , vj ) satisfies |uj | < \u03b4|vj |. Let z \u2208 {x, y} the coordinate of x\nsuch that Wx (t) = Wz (t) for all t \u2208 [tj , tj+1]. Let t\u2032 be the time of the\nunique local maximum of Wx such that\ntj < t\u2032 < tj+1 .\nThen t\u2032 = log(qq \u2032 ) where q < q \u2032 are the heights of a pair of consecutive\nconvergents of z. From\nWx (t\u2032 ) \u2212 Wx (tj ) = t\u2032 \u2212 tj ,\n\nWx (tj ) = tj \u2212 2 log |uj |,\n\nand\n\nWx (t\u2032 ) = Wz (t\u2032 ) = t\u2032 \u2212 2 log q\n\nwe see that q = |uj |; and since tj < t\u2032 we also have q \u2032 > |vj |. Thus\n|vj | lies strictly between q and q \u2032 so that v\u0307j , which is a convergent of y,\ncannot be a convergent of z; it follows that\nz = x.\nAnd since u\u0307j+1 is a convergent of x with |uj+1| > |uj | = q and q \u2032\nis the height of the convergent that immediately follows u\u0307j , we have\nq \u2032 \u2264 |uj+1|. On the other hand,\n2 log q \u2032 \u2212 tj+1 = Wx (tj+1 ) \u2265 log\n\n|uj+1|\n|vj+1 |\n\nimplies that q \u2032 \u2265 |uj+1|, so that q \u2032 = |uj+1|. It follows by the definition\nof q and q \u2032 that uj \u22a2 uj+1.\nWe claim |vj | \u2264 |vj+1|. Indeed, suppose on the contrary that |vj+1| <\n|vj |. Let q \u2032\u2032 be the height of the convergent of y that immediately follows\nv\u0307j+1. Since v\u0307j+1 precedes v\u0307j in the continued fraction expansion of y,\nwe must have q \u2032\u2032 \u2264 |vj |. Let t\u2032\u2032 be the time of the local maximum\nof Wx that immediately follows tj+1. Arguing as before, we see that\nt\u2032\u2032 = log(|vj+1|q \u2032\u2032 ) and since t\u2032\u2032 > tj+1 we have q \u2032\u2032 > |uj+1| = q \u2032 > |vj |,\nwhich gives a contradiction, proving the claim.\nSince vj and vj+1 are convergents of y, it follows that vj |= vj+1 ,\nwhich together with uj \u22a2 uj+1 establishes the third condition\n\u03b1j+1 \u2208 \u03c3(\u03b1j )\n\n\f18\n\nYITWAH CHEUNG\n\nin the definition of a self-similar covering. From\n|uj+1|\n2 log q \u2032 \u2212 tj+1 = W (tj+1) = log\n|vj+1 |\n\nwe see that q \u2032 = max(|uj+1|, |vj+1|). Since q \u2032 = |uj+1|, as was shown\nearlier, we have |vj+1| \u2264 |uj+1| and since \u03b1j+1 \u2208 J we actually have\n|vj+1| < \u03b4|uj+1|. Therefore, |uj | < \u03b4|vj | \u2264 \u03b4|vj+1 | < \u03b4 2 |uj+1| so that\n\ndiam B(\u03b1j+1 )\n|uj ||vj |\n=\n< \u03b42 < 1\ndiam B(\u03b1j )\n|uj+1||vj+1|\ngiving the second condition in the definition of a self-similar covering\nwith \u03bb = \u03b4 2 . As the case where \u03b1j = (uj , vj ) satisfies |vj | < \u03b4|uj | can be\ntreated by a similar argument, this completes the proof that (B, J, \u03c3)\nis a self-similar covering of E2 (\u03b4).\nNow we analyse the set \u03c3(u, v) for each (u, v) \u2208 J. As before, we\nconsider only the case |u| < \u03b4|v| as the other case is similar.\nLet \u03c0 : \u03c3(u, v) \u2192 N \u00d7 N be the function defined as follows. Given\n\u2032 \u2032\n(u , v ) \u2208 \u03c3(u, v) we have u \u22a2 u\u2032 , v |= v \u2032 and\n|v \u2032| < \u03b4|u\u2032 |.\n\nSince u \u22a2 u\u2032 so that |u \u00d7 u\u2032 | = 1 we have\n\nu\u2032 = au + \u0169\n\nfor some positive integer a and some \u0169 \u2208 Q \u222a {\u00b1(1, 0)} satisfying\n|\u0169| < |u|; moreover, both a and \u0169 are uniquely determined by u\u2032 . Since\nv |= v \u2032 , there is a sequence (vk ) \u2208 C and k, l \u2265 0 such that v = vk and\nv \u2032 = vk+l . We either have v \u2032 = v, v \u2032 = vk+1 , or v \u2032 is a positive linear\ncombination of v and vk+1 . Since vk+1 = a\u2032 v + \u1e7d for some uniquely\ndetermined integer a\u2032 > 0 and \u1e7d \u2208 Q \u222a {\u00b1(1, 0)} such that |\u1e7d| < |v|,\nwe have in any case\nv \u2032 = bv + c\u1e7d\nfor some uniquely determined b > 0 and c \u2265 0 such that c \u2264 b. (In\nfact, gcd(b, c) = 1 although this will not be used.) We define\n\u03c0(u\u2032 , v \u2032) = (a, b).\nFor each (u\u2032 , v \u2032 ) \u2208 \u03c0 \u22121 (a, b) we have the inequalities\nso that\n\na|u| \u2264 |u\u2032| \u2264 2a|u| and b|v| \u2264 |v \u2032 | \u2264 2b|v|\n\n1\ndiam B(u\u2032 , v \u2032)\n|u||v|\n1\n\u2264\n= \u2032 \u2032 \u2264 .\n4ab\ndiam B(u, v)\n|u ||v |\nab\nFrom the inequalities\n|v| \u2264 b|v| \u2264 |v \u2032| < \u03b4|u\u2032 | \u2264 2a\u03b4|u| < 2a\u03b4 2 |v|\n\n\fHAUSDORFF DIMENSION FOR DIVERGENCE IN A PRODUCT SPACE\n\n19\n\nwe obtain the following bounds\n1\na > 2 and 1 \u2264 b \u2264 2a\u03b4 2 .\n2\u03b4\n\u22121\nObserve that \u03c0 (a, b) contains at most 8b elements since there are at\nmost two choices for each of \u0169 and \u1e7d while there are at most b + 1 \u2264 2b\nchoices for c.\nWe now compute for any s \u2208 (1.5, 2)\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013s\nX\nX] 8\nX [2a\u03b4\ndiam B(u\u2032 , v \u2032)\n\u2264\ndiam B(u, v)\nas bs\u22121\n\u2032 \u2032\n2 b=1\n(u ,v )\u2208\u03c3(u,v)\n\na>1/2\u03b4\n\n\u2264\n\n1\n8 * (2\u03b4 2 )2\u2212s X\n2s\u22122\n2\u2212s\na\n2\na>1/2\u03b4\n\n8 * (2\u03b4 2 )s\u22121\n16\u03b4\n\u2264\n.\n(2s \u2212 3)(2 \u2212 s)\n(2s \u2212 3)(2 \u2212 s)\nThe last expression is equal to one if\n\u2264\n\n2s2 \u2212 7s + 6 + 16\u03b4 = 0\n\nso that Theorem 5.3 applies to give\nr\n1\n3\n7\n\u2212 8\u03b4 = + 16\u03b4 + O(\u03b4 2)\ndimH E2 (\u03b4) \u2264 \u2212\n4\n16\n2\n\u22127\nfor any \u03b4 \u2264 2 .\n\n6.2.

Thus, for any l \u2265 0 the triple (ul , vl , il ) satisfies\n\u221a\n(10)\n|ul+1 | < \u03b4|vl |,\n|vl |2 < |vl+1 ||ul+2|,\nand u\u0307l and v\u0307l are consecutive convergents of xil .\nFor any l > 0 let cl be the element (c1 , . . . , cn ) \u2208 Qn given by\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 ul+1 i = il+1\nvl\ni = il\nci =\n\uf8f3 w otherwise\ni\n\nwhere wi \u2208 Q is the element such that \u1e87i is the rational closest to xi\nwhose height |wi | divides |ul+1||vl |. Let \u03b1l = (cl , il , il+1 ) and note that\n\u03b1l \u2208 J by the first condition in (10) and the definition of wi .\n\n\fHAUSDORFF DIMENSION FOR DIVERGENCE IN A PRODUCT SPACE\n\n21\n\nNow we check that (\u03b1l )l>0 satisfies the first condition in the definition\nof a self-similar covering. To avoid double subscript notation, we fix\nl > 0 and let (c, i, j) = \u03b1l = (cl , il , il+1 ). Then\n(11)\n\nci = vl ,\n\ncj = ul+1\n\nand for k 6= i, j \u010bk is the rational closest to xk with height dividing\n|ci ||cj |. Since v\u0307l+1 is the convergent of xj that immediately follows \u010bj ,\nand |vl | < |vl+1 |, we have\n|xj \u2212 \u010bj | <\n\n1\n1\n<\n.\n|ul+1||vl+1 |\n|ci ||cj |\n\nLikewise, \u010bi = v\u0307l is a convergent of xi so that\n|xi \u2212 \u010bi | <\n\n1\n1\n=\n.\n2\n|vl |\n|ci |2\n\nBy definition of ck we have (for k 6= i, j)\n|xk \u2212 \u010bk | \u2264\n\n1\n1\n<\n.\n2|ci ||cj |\n|ci ||cj |\n\nIt follows that x \u2208 A(\u03b1l ) for all l > 0, and since A(\u03b1l ) \u2282 B(\u03b1l ) and\ndiam B(\u03b1l ) = |ul+12 ||vl | \u2192 0 as l \u2192 \u221e we conclude that \u2229B(\u03b1l ) = {x}.\nNow we check that (\u03b1l ) satisfies the second and third conditions in\nthe definition of a self-similar covering. Fix l > 0 and let (c, i, j) = \u03b1l\nand (c\u2032 , i\u2032 , j \u2032 ) = \u03b1l+1 . In addititon to (11) we also have\ni\u2032 = il+l = j,\n\nc\u2032j = vl+1 ,\n\nand c\u2032j \u2032 = ul+2.\n\nWe first check that \u03b1l+1 satisfies the conditions (a)-(e) in the definition\nof \u03c3(\u03b1l ). Since u\u0307l+1 , v\u0307l+1 are consecutive convergents of xj and |ul+1| <\n|vl+1 |, we have ul+1 \u22a2 vl+1 so that (a) follows. If j \u2032 = i then v\u0307l , u\u0307l+2\nare convergents of xi and since v\u0307l+2 is the convergent that immediately\nfollows u\u0307l+2, we cannot have |ul+2| < |vl | (because then |vl+2 | \u2264 |vl |,\nwhich is a contradiction); therefore, |vl | \u2264 |ul+2| from which it follows\nthat vl |= ul+2 , giving (b). The conditions in (c) follows from |vl | <\n|vl+1 | and |ul+1 | < |ul+2|, while (d) follows from x \u2208 A(\u03b1l ) \u2229 A(\u03b1l+1 ),\nand (e) follows from the second condition in (10). Now using (e) and\n\u03b1l \u2208 J we find\ndiam B(\u03b1l+1 )\n|cj |\n|ci ||cj |\n= \u2032 \u2032 <\n< \u03b4 1/2 < 1\ndiam B(\u03b1l )\n|ci\u2032 ||cj \u2032 |\n|ci |\n\nso that the second condition in the definition of a self-similar covering\nholds with \u03bb = \u03b4 1/2 .\n\n\f22\n\nYITWAH CHEUNG\n\nNow we analyse the set \u03c3(\u03b1) for each \u03b1 \u2208 J. Given \u03b1\u2032 \u2208 \u03c3(\u03b1) we set\n\u03b1 = (c, i, j) and \u03b1\u2032 = (c\u2032 , i\u2032 , j \u2032) so that\ndiam B(\u03b1) =\n\n2\n|ci ||cj |\n\nand\n\ndiam B(\u03b1\u2032 ) =\n\n2\n|c\u2032i\u2032 ||c\u2032j \u2032 |\n\n.\n\nComputing the sum in (7) reduces to analysing the possibilities for\nthe elements c\u2032i\u2032 and c\u2032j \u2032 of Q. The possibilities for c\u2032i\u2032 can be analysed\nusing the same techniques in the case n = 2; they can also be used to\nanalyse the possibilities for c\u2032j \u2032 if j \u2032 = i. The main new ingredient is\nestimating the number of possibilities for c\u2032j \u2032 in the case when j \u2032 6= i.\nSince diam B(\u03b1\u2032 ) < diam B(\u03b1) we observe that \u010b\u2032j \u2032 is a rational that lies\nwithin diam B(\u03b1) of \u010bj \u2032 and is therefore restricted to some interval of\nlength 2 diam B(\u03b1) centered at cj \u2032 . Before continuing the calculation,\nwe pause to state a lemma that will be used to estimate the number of\npossibilities for c\u2032j \u2032 in the case when j \u2032 6= i.\nLemma 6.2. Let I be an open interval of the real line and b a positive\ninteger. Suppose that the minimum height of a rational in I is q. Then\nthe number of rationals in I with heights q \u2032 satisfying \u230aq \u2032 /q\u230b = b is at\nmost 2bq 2 |I|.\nProof. A rational in I satisfying the given condition corresponds to\nan integer point with relatively prime coordinates in the region P :=\n{(x, y)|x/y \u2208 I, bq \u2264 y < (b + 1)q}. It suffices to show that P contains\nat most (b + 1)q 2 |I| integer points (relatively prime or not).\nLet p/q be any rational in I of minimum height. The projection of\nP onto the x-axis along lines of slope q/p is an open interval of length\n(b + 1)q|I|. An integer point in P maps to a rational whose height\ndivides q. Since a line of slope q/p contains at most one integer point\nin P , it follows there are at most (b + 1)q 2 |I| integer points in P . \u0003\nLet \u03c3k (c, i, j) be the subset of \u03c3(c, i, j) consisting of those triples\n(c\u2032 , i\u2032 , j \u2032 ) with j \u2032 = k. Note that \u03c3j (c, i, j) = \u2205 since j \u2032 6= i\u2032 = j. For\nk 6= j, let \u03c0k : \u03c3k (c, i, j) \u2192 N \u00d7 N be the function that sends (c\u2032 , j, k)\nto the pair (a, b) given by\n\u0018 \u2032 \u0019\n\u0016 \u2032 \u0017\n|cj |\n|ck |\na=\nand\nb=\n|cj |\nqk\nwhere qk := |ci | if k = i and is otherwise set equal to the minimum\n4\nheight of a rational in the open interval centered at \u010bk of length |ci||c\n.\nj|\nTo see that \u03c0k is well-defined we need to check that a \u2265 1, which holds\nby the second condition in (c), and that b \u2265 1, which, in the case k = i,\nholds with equality and otherwise because the rational \u010b\u2032k lies in the\n\n\fHAUSDORFF DIMENSION FOR DIVERGENCE IN A PRODUCT SPACE\n\n23\n\n4\nand qk is the minimum\nopen interval centered at \u010bk of length |ci||c\nj|\nheight of a rational in that interval.\nFor each (c\u2032 , j, k) \u2208 \u03c0k\u22121 (a, b) we have the inequalities\n\n|c\u2032j | \u2264 a|cj | \u2264 2|c\u2032j | and\n\n|c\u2032k |\n\u2264 bqk \u2264 |c\u2032k |\n2\n\nso that\n(12)\n\n|ci |\ndiam B(\u03b1\u2032 )\n2|ci |\n\u2264\n\u2264\n.\n2abqk\ndiam B(\u03b1)\nabqk\n\nMoreover, the first condition in (c) and \u03b1 \u2208 J implies\n|c\u2032j |\n|ci |\n1\n>\n>\na>\n|cj |\n|cj |\n\u03b4\nwhile \u03b1\u2032 \u2208 J and the first inequality above imply\n\u221a\n\u221a\n|c\u2032k | < \u03b4|c\u2032j | < a \u03b4|cj |\ngiving us the following bounds\n\n\u221a\na \u03b4|cj |\n1\nand 1 \u2264 b \u2264\n.\n(13)\na> \u221a\nqk\n\u03b4\nNow we estimate the number of elements in \u03c0i\u22121 (a, b). Since each element is of the form (c\u2032 , j, i) we need to bound the number of possibilities\nfor c\u2032 \u2208 Qn . By (a) cj \u22a2 c\u2032j from which it follows that c\u2032j = a\u2032 cj + u\nfor some positive integer a\u2032 and some u \u2208 Q \u222a {\u00b1(1, 0)} satisfying\n|cj \u00d7 u| = 1 and |u| < |cj |. Note that a\u2032 is uniquely determined\n(a\u2032 = a \u2212 1) while u admits two possibilities, giving rise to 2 choices for\nc\u2032j . By (b) ci |= c\u2032i from which it follows that \u010b\u2032i is a convergent of \u010bi and\ntherefore is restricted to an open interval of length |c2i |2 centered at \u010bi .\nSince \u010bi is the rational of minimum height in this interval and |ci | = qk ,\nLemma 6.2 implies there are at most 4b choices for c\u2032i . For any index\n4\nk 6= i, j the rational \u010b\u2032k is restricted to an open interval of length |ci ||c\nj|\nand since its height |c\u2032k | divides |c\u2032i ||c\u2032j |, the number of choices for c\u2032k\n4|c\u2032 ||c\u2032 |\n\nis bounded above by |cii||cjj| , which, by the first inequality in (12), is\nbounded by 8ab.
