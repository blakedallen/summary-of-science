Several mechanisms for additional braking in a young neutron star,\nespecially by fall back, are also explored.\nSubject headings: stars: massive, rotation, magnetic fields \u2013 pulsars: rotation\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nMassive stars are known to be rapid rotators with typical equatorial velocities around\n200 km s\u22121 or more during hydrogen burning (Fukuda 1982). It has long been known that\nthis much rotation could have a significant influence on the evolution of the star, both on the\nmain sequence and during in its later stages of evolution (e.g., Endal & Sophia 1976; Endal &\nSofia 1978; Heger et al. 2000; Maeder & Meynet 2001; Hirishi et al. 2004). For example, on the\nmain sequence, surface abundance patterns are observed (e.g., Gies & Lambert 1992; Herrero\n1994; Vrancken et al. 2000; Venn 1999) that are most naturally explained by rotationallyinduced mixing in the stellar interior (e.g., Venn 1999; Heger & Langer 2000; Meynet &\nMaeder 2000).\nNumerical studies of of the later evolutionary stages of rotating massive stars initially\nfound that the stellar core would reach critical (Keplerian) rotation by the time carbon\nignited in the core (e.g., Kippenhahn et al. 1970; Endal & Sophia 1976), especially when\nangular momentum transport is neglected. Thus one might encounter triaxial deformation\nearly on, with continued evolution hovering near instability. Modern stellar models that\ninclude more instabilities capable of transporting angular momentum find that considerable\nangular momentum is lost from the core during hydrogen and helium burning (Endal & Sofia\n1978), especially when the stabilizing effect of composition gradients is reduced (Pinsonneault\net al. 1989; Heger et al. 2000; Maeder & Meynet 2001; Hirishi et al. 2004). Such stars now\nevolve to iron core collapse, but still form very rapidly rotating (\u223c 1 ms) neutron stars.\nHowever, with the exception of Spruit & Phinney (1998) and Maeder & Meynet (2004),\nall studies of massive stellar evolution to date have ignored what is probably a major effect,\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nthe torques exerted in differentially rotating regions by the magnetic fields that thread them.\nThis omission has not been because such torques were thought to be unimportant, but\nbecause of the complexity and uncertainty of carrying out even one-dimensional calculations\nthat included them. This uncertainty, in turn, related to the absence of a credible physical\ntheory that would even qualitatively describe the separate evolution of the radial and poloidal\ncomponents of the field, both of which are necessary to calculate the torque,\nS=\n\nBr B\u03c6\n4\u03c0\n\n(1)\n\nSpruit & Phinney (1998) estimated these torques assuming that the poloidal field results\nfrom differential winding and that the radial field would, due to the action of unspecified\ninstabilities, be comparable. Particular attention was paid to the region of large shear that\nseparates the core of helium and heavy elements from the very slowly rotating hydrogen\nenvelope of a red supergiant star. This assumption, Br \u223c B\u03c6 , probably overestimated the\nactual Br by orders of magnitude and the rotation rates that Spruit & Phinney (1998)\nestimated for young pulsars were thus too slow (see also Livio & Pringle 1998).\nMore recently, Spruit (2002) has provided improved estimates for Br and B\u03c6 based\nupon a dynamo process that takes into account the effect of stable stratifications. Here\nwe investigate the effect of this prescription in a stellar evolution code used to study the\ncomplete evolution of massive stars. Particular attention is given to the rotation rate it\nimplies for young neutron stars. In \u00a72, we describe the physical and numerical modeling. In\n\u00a73, the results for 12, 15, 20, 25 and 35 M\u2299 stars are presented and, in \u00a74, compared with\nobservational data. Typical neutron star rotation rates, at birth, are \u223c 15 ms. In \u00a75 we\ndiscuss other possible ways that such rapidly rotating stars might be slowed during the first\ndays of their evolution by magnetic winds and fall back. The surface abundance changes\ndue to rotationally-induced mixing are discussed in \u00a76 and in \u00a77 we give our conclusions.\n2.\n\nImplementation of Magnetic Braking\n\nThe treatment of magnetic torques given by Spruit (2002) was implemented in a version\nof the implicit hydrodynamics stellar evolution code (KEPLER, Weaver et al. 1978) that\nalready included angular momentum transport and mixing due to a number of non-magnetic\nprocesses. See Heger et al. (2000) for a discussion of these non-magnetic instabilities and\nSpruit (1999, 2002) for a detailed description of the dynamo mechanism. Here we discuss\nonly the implementation of and results from that physical model.\nBoth angular momentum transport and chemical mixing are calculated by solving the\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\ntime-dependent diffusion equation (Heger et al. 2000). It is assumed that the dynamo adjusts\nand reaches equilibrium field strength on a time-scale that is short compared to the evolution\ntime-scales of the star, i.e., we neglect the time required to reach the steady state field\nstrength and distribution described by Spruit (2002) and only apply their equilibrium values.\nThis should be a reasonable approximation in all but the most advanced burning stages that\noccur when the angular momentum distribution has already been frozen in. The validity of\nthis assumption is revisited in \u00a77\n2.1.\n\nThe dynamo process in radiative regions\n\nSpruit (2002) discusses two limiting cases: stabilization by composition gradients (Spruit's\nCase 0), and stabilization by superadiabatic temperature gradients (Spruit's Case 1). Realistic stellar models exhibit both kinds of gradients at same time, so the intermediate case\nmust also be included (see also Maeder & Meynet 2004).\nThe effective viscosity, \u03bde , for the radial transport of angular momentum results from\nazimuthal stress due to the field generated by the dynamo, S = Br B\u03c6 /4\u03c0. Its value is given\nby\n\u03bde \u2261 S/\u03c1q\u03a9 .\n(2)\nSee also eqs. 34-40 of Spruit (2002). We also implement the \"effective diffusivity\", De \u2261 \u03b7e ,\ngiven in his eqs. 41-43. Here \u03a9 is the angular velocity, q = d ln \u03a9/d ln r is the shear, r is the\nradius, \u03c1 is the density, and S is the stress.\nFor application outside the regime of \"ideal gas with radiation\" where the gradient of\nthe mean molecular weight determines the stabilization, we replace N\u03bc2 by a more general\n2\nformulation (\"Ncomp\n\"), but do not change nomenclature. This way the discussion in Spruit\n(2002) can be followed without further revision. Generally, the Bruntv\u00e4s\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency is\n\u0012\n\u0013\ng\n1\nd ln \u03c1\n2\nN =\n,\n(3)\n\u2212\nHP \u03931 d ln P\nwhere g = \u2212GM(r)/r 2 is the local gravitational acceleration, P is the pressure, HP =\n\u2212dr/d ln P is the pressure scale height, and the derivatives are total derivatives in the star.\nThe compositional contribution to the Bruntv\u00e4s\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\ng\nd ln T\nd ln \u03c1\n2\nN\u03bc =\n\u03b1\u2212\u03b4\n,\n(4)\n\u2212\nHP\nd ln P\nd ln P\nwhere T is the temperature. The thermodynamic quantities \u03b1, \u03b4, and \u03931 obey their common definitions (e.g., Kippenhahn & Weigert 1990). Again, the derivatives are the actual\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\ngradients in the star, not thermodynamic derivatives. The thermal contribution to the\nBruntv\u00e4s\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency is then given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\ng\n1\nd ln T\n2\n2\n2\nNT = N \u2212 N\u03bc =\n\u2212\u03b1+\u03b4\n.\n(5)\nHP \u03931\nd ln P\nAs stated above, we use the symbol N\u03bc2 to indicate (the square of) the Bruntv\u00e4s\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency\n2\ndue to the composition gradient for a general equation of state (\u2261 Ncomp\n), not just due to\nchanges of mean molecular weight, \u03bc. Appendices A and B give a derivation of the general\nexpressions. This formulation is identical with the stability analysis for the different regimes\n(next section) as used in KEPLER, and therefore necessary for consistency in regimes where\nthe assumption of an ideal gas is a poor approximation.\n\n2.2.\n\nThe dynamo in semiconvective and thermohaline regions\n\nIn addition to the radiative regime, I, where both composition gradients and temperature gradients are stabilizing, other regimes have to be considered in which \"secular\" mixing\nprocesses operate. These are secular as opposed to processes like convection that operate on a\nhydrodynamic time scale. Two of these are semiconvection (II; where a stabilizing composition gradient dominates a destabilizing temperature gradient) and thermohaline convection,\nalso called the salt-finger instability (III; where a stabilizing temperature gradient dominates\na destabilizing composition gradient; e.g., Braun 1997; Heger et al. 2000, their Figure 1 for\nan overview). The final regime of hydrodynamic instability in non-rotating stars is that of\nLedoux convection (Ledoux 1958; Regime IV; wehere the destabilizing temperature gradient is stronger than any stabilization by the composition gradient). In the Ledoux regime,\neffective viscosities and diffusivities are given by mixing length theory (Heger et al. 2000).\nA very approximate treatment of Regimes II and III is given in the next two sections.\n\n2.2.1. The semiconvective case\nIn semiconvective regions (Regime II), the square of the thermal buoyancy frequency\nis negative and thus the limiting Case 1 would be convection. Instead of equation (34) of\nSpruit (2002), we first compute an \"dynamo\" effective viscosity by\n\u03bdre = \u03bde0 f (q) ,\n\n(6)\n\nwith \u03bde0 from equation (35) of Spruit (2002) and qmin = q0 (equations 37-39 of Spruit 2002).\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nAdopting a model for semiconvection in the non-linear regime similar to Spruit (1992),\nwe assume the radiative flux is transported by convective motions in the semiconvective\nlayers. For the sake of simplicity, we compute an effective turbulent viscosity, \u03bdsc , from\nthe velocities according to mixing-length theory (Schwarzschild & H\u00e4rm 1958) assuming\nSchwarzschild convection (i.e., when the \u03bc gradient is neglected),\nvconv \u2261\n\n\u0012\n\ng\u03b4HP L\n64\u03c0\u03c1cP T r 2\n\n\u00131/3\n\n(7)\n\n(e.g., as derived from equations 7.6 and 7.7 of Kippenhahn & Weigert 1990) and an assumed\ncharacteristic length scale of HP by\n1\n\u03bdsc \u2261 HP vconv ,\n3\n\n(8)\n\n(however, see Spruit 1992), and cP is the specific heat capacity at constant pressure.\nFinally, we assume that the actual viscosity is somewhere between that of the case of\nmere semiconvection and that of the dynamo dominated by composition stratification and\ntake the geometric mean between the two viscosities,\n\u03bde \u2261\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03bdre \u03bdsc .\n\n(9)\n\nThe effective turbulent diffusion coefficient, De , is computed in an analogous way, \u03bdre , i.e.,\nDe = De0 f (q), qmin = q0 . Due to the properties of the layers semiconvection model (Spruit\n1992) \u2013 negligible diffusivity in typical stellar environments \u2013, we do not compute a geometric\nmean with the semiconvective diffusivity similar to Eq. (9). Instead we just add it to the\nsemiconvective diffusion coefficient computed in KEPLER. Typically it is negligible.\n\n2.2.2. The thermohaline case\nIn this regime (III) the compositional buoyancy frequency becomes negative and the\nlimiting Case 0 would be Rayleigh-Taylor unstable. We assume the limiting Case 1 of Spruit\n(2002) and compute \u03bde = \u03bde1 , De = De1 , and qmin = q1 , analogous to the semiconvective\ncase.\nIn massive stars, thermohaline convection typically occurs following radiative shell burning in the fuel \"trace\" left behind by an receding central convective burning phase. The\nhigher temperature of shell burning can sometimes create heavier ashes than core burning\nand the resulting compositional structure is unstable. The contraction phase after central\nhelium burning is the most important domain in massive stars.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nGenerally, the motions associated with the growth of this instability (\"salt fingers\") are\nvery slow. Thus the interaction with the dynamo is much more restricted than in the case of\nsemiconvection. Therefore we do not employ a interpolation between the dynamo effective\nradial viscosity or diffusivity as is done in \u00a72.2.1.\n2.3.\n\nEvaluating the magnetic field strength\n\nThe most interstesting result of the dynamo model is the magnetic field strength. Combining equations (21), (23), (35) and (36) of Spruit (2002), one has\n\u0012\n\nBr\n\u03bde = r \u03a9\nB\u03c6\n2\n\n\u00132\n\n.\n\n(10)\n\nUsing his equation (28), the components of the field are:\n\n3.\n\nBr4 = 16\u03c0 2 \u03c12 \u03bde 3 q 2 \u03a9r \u22122\n\n(11)\n\nB\u03c64 = 16\u03c0 2\u03c12 \u03bde q 2 \u03a93 r 2 .\n\n(12)\n\nResults Including Magnetic Torques\n3.1.\n\nImplementation\n\nBased upon the assumptions in \u00a72, the full evolution of stars of 12, 15, 20, 25, and 35 M\u2299\nof solar metallicity was calculated. For comparison, equivalent models were also calculated\nwithout magnetic fields for three of these stars. The initial models and input physics were the\nsame as in Rauscher et al. (2001), but the total angular momentum of the star was chsen such\nthat a typical initial equatorial rotation velocity of \u223c 200 km s\u22121 (Fukuda 1982) was reached\non the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS; see Heger et al. 2000). Time-dependent mixing and\nangular momentum transport were followed as discussed by Heger et al. (2000) with the\nturbulent viscosities and diffusivities from the dynamo model added to those from the model\nfor the hydrodynamic instabilities. For the time being, possible interactions between the two\nare neglected (though see Maeder & Meynet 2004). Our standard case (B) implements the\ndescription as outlined in the previous sections.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n3.2.\n\nPresupernova Models and Pulsar Rotation Rates\n\nTables 1 - 6 and Fig. 1 summarize our principal results. As also noted by Maeder &\nMeynet (2004), the inclusion of magnetic torques with a magnitude given by Spruit (2002),\ngreatly decreases the differential rotation of the star leading to more slowly rotating cores.\nFor illustration, we consider in some detail the evolution of the 15 M\u2299 model with\nstandard parameter settings. Table 1 shows that, over the course of the entire evolution, the\ntotal angular momentum enclosed by fiducial spheres of mass coordinate 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 M\u2299\ndecreases in the magnetic models by a factor of 100 to 200, far more than in the non-magnetic\ncomparison model. In both cases most of the angular momentum transport occurs prior to\ncarbon ignition (Figs. 2 and 3). The greatest fractional decrease occurs during the transition\nfrom hydrogen depletion to helium ignition (Table 1, Fig. 2) as the star adjusts to its new\nred giant structure. During this transition, the central density goes up by a factor of about\n100 (from 11 g cm\u22123 to 1400 g cm\u22123 ) with an accompanying increase in differential rotation\nand shear. Though the angular momentum evolves little after carbon burning, modified only\nby local shells of convection, there is a factor of two change after carbon ignition (central\ntemperature = 5\u00d7108 K).\nThe magnetic torques are sufficiently strong to enforce rigid rotation both on the main\nsequence and in the helium core during helium burning for all masses considered (see also\nMaeder & Meynet 2004). The appreciable braking that occurs during hydrogen and helium\nburning is therefore a consequence of mass loss and evolving stellar structure, especially the\nformation of a slowly rotating hydrogen envelope around a rapidly rotating helium core.\nTypically the more massive stars spend a shorter time during the critical Kelvin-Helmholtz\ncontraction between hydrogen depletion and helium ignition and also have a shorter helium\nburning lifetime. Hence, even though they actually have a little less angular momentum at\nthe fiducial mass points in Table 1 on the main sequence, the more massive stars have more\nangular momentum in their cores at the end of helium burning. This distinction persists\nand the more massive stars give birth to more rapidly rotating neutron stars.\nStars that include all the usual non-magnetic mechanisms for rotational mixing and\nangular momentum transport (Heger et al. 2000), but which lack magnetic fields have a\nconsiderably different evolution and end up with 30 to 50 times more angular momentum in\nthat part of their core destined to collapse to a neutron star (Tables 1 and 3, Figs. 2 and\n3). Most notable is the lack of appreciable braking of the helium core by the outer layers in\nthe period between hydrogen core depletion and helium ignition. The post-carbon-ignition\nbraking that accounted for an additional factor of two in the magnetic case is also much\nweaker. In fact, the inner 1.5 M\u2299 of the 15 M\u2299 model has only about five times less angular\nmomentum at core collapse than implied by strict conservation from the (rigidly rotating)\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nmain sequence onwards. As noted previously many times, such a large amount of angular\nmomentum would have important consequences for the supernova explosion mechanism.\nRigidly rotating neutron stars cannot have a period shorter than about 1 ms.\nTable 2 gives the magnetic field components that exist in different parts of the star\nduring different evolutionary phases. The magnetic field is highly variable from location\nto location in the star and the values given are representative, but not accurate to better\nthan a factor of a few (Fig. 1), especially during the late stages. As expected, the toroidal\nfield, which comes from differential winding is orders of magnitude larger than the radial\nfield generated by the Tayler instability. The product B\u03c6 Br scales very approximately as\nthe central density with the ratio Br /B\u03c6 \u223c 10\u22123 \u2212 10\u22124 . Though the formulae used here are\nexpected to break down during core collapse, a simple extrapolation to 1015 g cm\u22123 for the\ncentral density of a neutron star suggests B\u03c6 \u223c 1014 and Br \u223c 1010 .\nTable 3 gives the expected pulsar rotation rates based upon a set of standard assumptions. Following Lattimer & Prakash (2001), it is assumed that all neutron stars (with\nrealistic masses) have a radius of 12 km and a moment of inertia 0.35 Mgrav R2 . Adding the\nbinding energy to the gravitational mass, assumed in Table 3 to be 1.4 M\u2299 gives the baryonic\nmass of the core that collapsed to the neutron star, 1.7 M\u2299 . Taking the angular momentum inside 1.7 M\u2299 from the presupernova model, assuming conservation during collapse, and\nsolving for the period then gives the values in the table.\n\n3.3.\n\nSensitivity To Uncertain Parameters\n\nIt is expected that our results will be sensitive to several uncertain factors including the\neffect of composition gradients, the efficiency of the dynamo in generating magnetic field, and\nthe initial angular momentum of the star. To some extent, these uncertainties are ameliorated\nby the strong sensitivity of the expected magnetic torques to rotation speed and differential\nshear (eq. 34\u201336 of Spruit 2002). Composition gradients have very significant influence on the\nresulting angular momentum transport by inhibiting the action of the dynamo. In particular,\ncomposition interfaces, as resulting from the nuclear burning processes in combination with\nconvection, usually also show significant shear, but if the dynamo action is suppressed by\na steep change in mean molecular weight, angular momentum can become \"trapped\" in a\nfashion similar to that observed by Heger et al. (2000). To illustrate the uncertainties of\nthe dynamo model, we studied several test cases where the stabilizing effect of composition\ngradients is varied by multiplying N\u03bc2 and NT2 by 1/10. We also explored multiplying the\noverall coefficient of the torque in eq. (1) by varying B\u03c6 Br by a factor of ten and multiplied\nthe initial rotational rate by 0.5 and 1.5 (Table 3).\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nIn three cases, the 20 and 25 M\u2299 with high rotation rate, and the \"normal\" 35 M\u2299 model,\nthe star lost its hydrogen-rich envelope due to mass loss either during (25 and 35 M\u2299 ) or just\nat the end (20 M\u2299 ) of it evolution. The KEPLER code was not able to smoothly run these\nmodels through the period where they lost their last solar mass of envelope because violent\npulsations were encountered. The last 0.5 to 1.0 M\u2299 was thus removed abruptly and the\ncalculation continued for the resulting Wolf-Rayet star. However, it is clear that removing\nthe envelope removes an appreciable braking torque on the helium core so it is reasonable\nthat the remnants of such stars rotate more rapidly.\n\n3.4.\n\nVariable Neutron Star Masses\n\nSince the iron core masses, silicon shell masses, and density profiles all differ appreciably\nfor presupernova stars in the 12 to 35 M\u2299 range, it is not realistic to assume that they all make\nneutron stars of the same mass. Ideally, one would extract realistic masses from a reliable,\ncredible model for the explosion, but, unfortunately, such models have not reached the point\nof making accurate predictions. Still there are some general features of existing models\nthat provide some guidance. As noted by Weaver et al. (1978), the remnant mass cannot\ntypically be less than the mass of the neutronized iron core. Otherwise one overproduces rare\nneutron-rich isotopes of the iron group. More important to the present discussion, successful\nexplosions, when they occur in modern codes, typically give \"mass cuts\" in the vicinity\nof large entropy jumps. The reason is that a jump in the entropy corresponds to sudden\ndecrease in the density. This in turn implies a sudden fall off in accretion as the explosion\ndevelops. The lower density material is also more loosely bound by gravity. The largest\njump in the vicinity of the iron core is typically at the base of the oxygen burning shell and\nthat has sometimes been used to estimate neutron star masses (Timmes et al. 1996). Recent\nstudies by Thomas Janka (private communication) suggest a numerical criterion, that the\nmass cut occurs where the entropy per baryon equals 4 kB . In Table 4, instead of assuming\na constant baryonic mass of 1.7 M\u2299 for the neutron star progenitor (as in Table 3), we take\nthe value where the specific entropy is 4 kB /baryon.\nAs expected this prescription gives larger baryonic masses for the remnant (\"Baryon\" in\nthe table). The fraction of this mass that is carried away by neutrinos is given by Lattimer\n& Prakash (2001),\n0.6\u03b2\nf=\n(13)\n1 \u2212 0.5\u03b2\nwhere \u03b2 = GMgrav /Rc2 . When this is subtracted, one obtains the gravitational masses,\nMgrav in Table 4. Using these, assuming once more a moment of inertia I = 0.35Mgrav R2\nand a radius of 12 km, and conserving angular momentum in the collapse one obtains the\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nperiod. Because the angular momentum per unit mass increases as one goes out in the star,\nusing a larger mass for the remnant increases its rotation rate.\nThe resulting values are similar to those in Table 3 for the same \"standard\" parameter\nsettings, but show even more clearly the tendency of larger stars to make more rapidly\nrotating pulsars. They also show an additional prediction of the model - that more massive\npulsars will rotate more rapidly. The numbers in Table 4 have not been corrected for the\nfact that the typical neutrino, since it last interacts at the edge of the neutron star, carries\naway more angular momentum than the average for its equivalent mass. Thus the periods\nin Table 4 can probably be multiplied by an additional factor of \u223c 1.2 (Janka 2004).\n4.\n\nComparison With Observed Pulsar Rotation Rates\n\nTable 5 gives the measured and estimated rotation rates and angular momenta of several\nyoung pulsars at birth (Muslimov & Page 1996; Marshall el al. 1998; Kaspi et al. 1994).\nTo estimate the angular momenta in the table, we have assumed, following Lattimer &\nPrakash (2001), that the moment of inertia for ordinary neutron stars (not quark stars) is\nI \u2248 0.35MR2 \u2248 1.4\u00d71045 g cm2 . Here a constant fiducial gravitational mass of 1.4 M\u2299 is\nassumed.\nGiven the uncertainties in both our model and the extrapolation of observed pulsar\nproperties, the agreement, at least for the 12 - 15 M\u2299 models, is quite encouraging. This\ntrue all the more so when one realizes that the periods in Tables 3 and 4 should be multiplied\nby a factor of approximately 1.2 \u2212 1.3 to account for the angular momentum carried away by\nneutrinos when the neutron star forms (Janka 2004). Then our standard, numerically typical\nsupernova, 15 M\u2299 , would produce a neutron star with angular momentum 5.8\u00d71047 erg s\n(\"PreSN\" entry in Table 1 divided by 1.3). It should also be noted that the most common\ncore collapse events - by number - will be in the 12 to 20 M\u2299 range because of the declining\ninitial mass function. Moreover, stars above around 25 - 30 M\u2299 may end up making black\nholes (Fryer 1999).\nWhat then is the observational situation? Marshall el al. (1998) have discovered a pulsar\nin the Crab-like supernova remnant, N157B, in the Large Magellanic Cloud, with a rotation\nrate of 16 ms. This is probably an upper bound to its rotation rate at birth. Glendenning\n(1996) gives an estimated initial rotation rate for the Crab pulsar itself of 19 ms. Estimating\nthe initial rotation rate of the much larger sample of pulsars, known to be rotating now\nmuch more slowly, is fraught with uncertainty. Nevertheless, PSR 0531+21 and PSR 150958 are also estimated to have been born with \u223c 20 ms periods Muslimov & Page (1996)\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n(though 0540-69 is estimated to have P0 \u2248 39 ms). At the other extreme, Pavlov et al.\n(2002) find for PKS1209-51/52 a rotation period of 424 ms and argue that the initial rate\nwas not much greater. Similarly, Kramer et al. (2003) argue that the initial rotation rate of\nPSR J0538+2817 was 139 ms.\n\n5.\n\nFurther Braking Immediately After the Explosion\n5.1.\n\nr-Mode Instability\n\nFor some time it was thought that gravitational radiation induced by the \"r-mode\ninstability\" would rapidly brake young neutron stars. However, Arras et al. (2003) found\nthat the r-mode waves saturate at amplitudes lower than obtained in previous numerical\ncalculations (Lindblom et al. 2001) that assumed an unrealistically large driving force. Much\nless gravitational radiation occurs and the braking time for a rapidly rotating neutron star\nbecomes millennia rather than hours. Arras et al. calculate that\n\u03c4spin\n\ndown\n\n= 2000 yr (\n\n\u03b1e \u22121 335 Hz 11\n) (\n) ,\n0.1\n\u03bd\n\n(14)\n\nwith \u03b1e , the maximum amplitude of the instability (for which Arras et al. estimate 0.1 as\nan upper bound). A 3 ms pulsar will thus take about 2000 years to substantially brake and\nthe more slowly rotating neutron stars in Tables 3 and 4 will take even longer.\n\n5.2.\n\nNeutrino-Powered Magnetic Stellar Winds\n\nWoosley & Heger (2004) and Thompson et al. (2004) have discussed the possibility\nthat a young, rapidly rotating neutron star will be braked by a magnetic stellar wind. This\nwind, powered by the neutrino emission of the supernova, may also be an important site for\nr-process nucleosynthesis (Thompson 2003).\nDuring the first 10 s of its life a neutron star emits about 20 % of its mass as neutrinos.\nThis powerful flux of neutrinos passing through the proto-neutron star atmosphere drives\nmass loss and the neutron star loses \u223c 0.01 M\u2299 (Duncan et al. 1986; Qian & Woosley 1996;\nThompson et al. 2001). Should magnetic fields enforce corotation on this wind out to a radius\nof 10 stellar radii, appreciable angular momentum could be lost from a 1.4 M\u2299 neutron star\n(since j \u223c r 2 \u03c9). The issue is thus one of magnetic field strength and its radial variation.\nFor a neutron star of mass M and radius, R6 , in units of 10 km, the mass loss rate is\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\napproximately (more accurate expressions are given by Qian & Woosley)\n\u00135/3\n\u00132\n\u0012\n\u0012\n1.4 M\u2299\nL\u03bd,tot\n5/3\n\u22123\n\u22121\nR6\n.\n\u1e40 \u2248 10 M\u2299 s\n1053 erg s\nM\n\n(15)\n\nThe field will cause corotation of this wind out to a radius (Mestel & Spruit 1987) where\nB2\n.\n(16)\n4\u03c0\nCalculations that include the effect of rotation on the neutrino-powered wind have yet to be\ndone, but one can estimate the radial density variation from the one-dimensional models of\nQian & Woosley (1996). For a mass loss rate of 10\u22122 M\u2299 s\u22121 they find a density and radial\nspeed at 100 km of 108 g cm\u22123 and 1000 km s\u22121 respectively. At this time, the proto-neutron\nstar radius is 30 km and these conditions persist for \u223c 1 s. Later, they find, for a mass\nloss rate of 10\u22125 M\u2299 s\u22121 and a radius of 10 km, a density at 100 km of \u223c 105 g cm\u22123 and\nvelocity 2000 km s\u22121 . This lasts \u223c 10 s. Unless \u03c9 is quite low, vwind is not critical. For\n\u03c9 \u223c 1000 rad s\u22121 the field required to hold 108 g cm\u22123 in corotation at 100 km is \u223c 3\u00d71014 G;\nfor 105 g cm\u22123 it is 1013 G.\n2\n\u03c1 (vwind\n+ \u03c9 2r2) \u2248\n\nTo appreciably brake such a rapidly rotating neutron star, assuming B \u223c r \u22122 , thus\nrequires ordered surface fields of \u223c 1015 - 1016 G. Similar conclusions have been reached\nindependently by Thompson (2003). Such fields are characteristic of magnetars, but probably\nnot of ordinary neutron stars. On the other hand if the rotation rate were already slow,\n\u03c9 \u223c 100 rad s\u22121 (P \u223c 60 ms), even a moderate field of 1014 G could have an appreciable\neffect. It should also be kept in mind that the field strength of a neutron star when it is 1 10 s old could be very different than thousands of years later when most measurements have\nbeen made.\n\n5.3.\n\nFallback and the Propeller Mechanism\n\nAfter the first 1000 s, the rate of accretion from fall back is given (MacFadyen et al.\n2001) by\n\u22125/3\n\u1e40 \u2248 10\u22127 t5\nM\u2299 s\u22121 ,\n(17)\nwith the time in units of 105 s. For the mass loss rate in units of 1026 g s\u22121 , we obtain\n\u22125/3\n\n\u1e4026 \u2248 2 t5\n\ng s\u22121 .\n\n(18)\n\nFor a dipole field with magnetic moment \u03bc30 = B12 R6 3 , with B12 the surface field in units\nof 1012 G, the infalling matter will be halted by the field at the Alfven radius (Alpar 2001),\n4/7\n\n\u22122/7\n\nrA = 6.8 \u03bc30 \u1e4026\n\nkm.\n\n(19)\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nAt that radius matter can be rotationally ejected, provided the angular velocity there corresponding to co-rotation exceeds the Keplerian orbital speed. The ejected matter carries away\nangular momentum and brakes the neutron star. This is the propeller mechanism (Illarionov\n& Sunyaev 1975; Chevalier 1989; Lin et al. 1991; Alpar 2001, but see the critical discussion\nin Rapport et al. 2004).\nObviously rA must exceed the neutron star radius (10 km here) if the field is to have\nany effect. The above equations thus require a strong field, B > 1012 G, and accretion rates\ncharacteristic of an age of at least one day. Additionally there is a critical accretion rate,\nfor a given field strength and rotation rate, above which the co-rotation speed at the Alfven\nradius will be slower than the Keplerian orbit speed. In this case the matter will accrete\nrather than be ejected. Magnetic braking will thus be inefficient until \u03c9 2 rA3 > GM, or\n7/3\n\n\u1e4026 < 5.7\u00d710\u22124 \u03c93\n\n\u03bc230 ,\n\n(20)\n\nwhere \u03c93 is the angular velocity in thousands of radians per second (\u03c93 = 1 implies a period\nof 2\u03c0 ms). This turns out to be a very restrictive condition. For a given \u03bc30 and \u03c93 , Eqs. (18)\nand (20) give a time, t5,min , when braking can begin. The torque on the neutron star from\nthat point on will be\n\u03bc2\n,\n(21)\nI \u03c9\u0307 = \u03bc2 /rA3 = 1060 30\nrA3\nwith I, the moment of inertia of the neutron star, approximately 1045 (Lattimer & Prakash\n2001). The integrated deceleration will be\n2/7 \u22123/7\n\n\u2206\u03c9 = 250 \u03bc30 t5,min.\n\n(22)\n\nPutting it all together, a 1.4 M\u2299 neutron star can be braked to a much slower speed\n(\u2206\u03c9 \u223c \u03c9) by fall back if \u03bc30 > 78, 43, or 25 for initial periods of 6, 21, or 60 ms, respectively.\nIf the surface field strength - for a dipole configuration is less than 2\u00d71013 G, braking by the\npropeller mechanism will be negligible in most interesting situations.\nHowever, we have so far ignored all non-magnetic forces save gravity and centrifugal\nforce. A neutron star of age less than one day is in a very special situation. The accretion\nrate given by Eq. (17) is vastly super-Eddington. This means that matter at the Alfven radius\nwill be braked by radiation as well as centrifugal force and the likelihood of its ejection is\ngreater. Fryer et al. (1996) have considered neutron star accretion at the rates relevant here\nand find that neutrinos released very near the neutron star actually drive an explosion of the\naccreting matter. Just how this would all play out in a multi-dimensional calculation that\nincludes magnetic braking, rotation, and a declining accretion rate has yet to be determined,\nbut is worth some thought.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nIf the accreting matter is actually expelled under 'propeller' conditions, one might expect\nthat the mechanism also inhibits the accretion so the process might be self-limiting. This\ntraditional view of the propeller mechanism may be misleading however. There is a range\nin conditions where accretion accompanied by spindown is expected to occur (Sunyaev &\nShakura 1977; Spruit & Taam 1993; for a recent discussion see Rapport et al. 2004), as\nobserved in the X-ray pulsars. If fall back is the way most neutron stars are slowed, one\nmight expect a correlation of pulsar period with the amount of mass that falls back and that\nmight increase with progenitor mass.\nMore massive stars may experience more fall back (Woosley & Weaver 1995) and make\nslowly rotating neutron stars. But, on the other hand, as Tables 3 and 4 show, neutron stars\nderived from more massive stars are born rotating more rapidly. There may be a mass around\n15 M\u2299 or so where the two effects combine to give the slowest rotation rate. Interestingly,\nthe Crab pulsar was probably once a star of \u223c 10 M\u2299 (Nomoto et al. 1982) and may thus\nhave experienced very little fall back. The matter that is ejected by the propeller mechanism\nin more massive stars could contribute appreciably to the explosion of the supernova and\nespecially its mixing.\n\n5.4.\n\nEffect of a Primordial Field\n\nAs noted above, the results agree with the initial rotation periods found in Crab-like\npulsars, but not with the long periods inferred for pulsars like PSR J0538+2817. Within the\nframework of our present theory, slowly rotating pulsars must have formed from stars with\ndifferent or additional angular momentum transport mechanisms. Another possibility is that\ntheir main sequence progenitors started with a qualitatively different magnetic field configuration. The dynamo process envisaged here assumes that the initial field of the star was\nsufficiently weak, such that winding-up by differential rotation produces the predominantly\ntoroidal field in which the dynamo process operates. Any weak large scale field initially\npresent is then expelled by turbulent diffusion associated with the dynamo.\nStars with strong initial fields, such as seen in the magnetic A-stars, cannot have followed\nthis path. In these stars, the magnetic field is likely to have eliminated any initial differential\nrotation of the star on a short time scale (Spruit 1999), after which it relaxed to the observed\nstable configurations (Braithwaite & Spruit 2004). In these configurations the radial and\nazimuthal field components are of similar magnitude. To the extent that such magnetic\nfields also exist in massive MS stars (where they are much harder to detect, see however\nDonati et al. 2002), they are likely to have led to a stronger magnetic coupling between core\nand envelope, and hence to more slowly rotating pre-SN cores.\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\n6.\n\nSurface Abundances\n\nThe abundances of certain key isotopes and elements on the surfaces of main sequence\nstars and evolved supergiants are known to be diagnostics of rotationally-induced mixing\n(Heger & Langer 2000; Maeder & Meynet 2000). In particular, on the main sequence, one\nexpects enhancements of 4 He, 13 C, 14 N, 17 O, and 23 Na and extra depletion of 12 C, 15 N, 16 O,\n18\nO, 19 F, Li, Be, and B. To test these predictions and their sensitivity to assumed magnetic\ntorques in the present models, we calculated three additional versions of our 15 M\u2299 model in\nwhich a large nuclear reaction network was carried in each zone. The adopted nuclear physics\nand network were essentially the same as in Rauscher et al. (2001). One model assumed no\nrotation; a second assumed rotation without magnetic torques; and a third, which included\nboth rotation and magnetic torques, was our standard model in Tables 1 - 4. The initial\nrotation rate assumed in the magnetic and non-magnetic models was the same.\nThe results (Table 6) show the same sort of rotationally-induced enhancements and\ndepletions on the main sequence (defined by half-hydrogen depletion at the center) as in\nHeger & Langer (2000). Helium is up by about half a percent and nitrogen is increased by\ntwo. Carbon is depleted by about 25 % and 15 N is depleted by a factor of two. The isotopes\n13\nC and 17 O are enhanced by factors of three and 1.6 respectively. Be and B are depleted.\nMost important to the current discussion, we see no dramatic differences between the\nsurface abundances calculated with and without magnetic torques. Maeder & Meynet (2004)\nsuggested that such differences might be a discriminant, perhaps ruling out torques of the\nmagnitude suggested by Spruit (2002).\n\n7.\n\nConclusions and Discussion\n\nGiven the uncertainty that must accompany any first-principles estimate of magnetic\nfield generation in the interior of stars, the rotation rates, we derive here compare quite\nfavorably with those inferred for a number of the more rapidly rotating pulsars. Without\ninvoking any additional braking during or after the supernova explosion, the most common\npulsars, which come from stars of 10 - 15 M\u2299 , will have rotation rates around 10 - 15 ms\n(Table 3). Reasonable variation in uncertain parameters could easily increase this to 20 ms.\nGiven that the torques in the formalism of Spruit (2002) depend upon the fourth power\nof the shear between layers, this answer is robust to small changes in the overall coupling\nefficiency and inhibition factors. If we accept the premise that only the fastest solitary\npulsars represent their true birth properties and the others have been slowed by fall back\nor other processes occurring during the first few years of evolution, our predictions are in\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nagreement with observations.\nIf correct, this conclusion will have important implications, not only for the evolution\nof pulsars, but for the supernova explosion mechanism, gravitational wave generation, and\nfor gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). For rotation rates more rapid than 5 ms, centrifugal forces\nare an important ingredient in modeling the collapse and the kinetic energy available from\nrotation is more than the 1051 erg customarily attributed to supernovae. At 10 ms, the energy\nis nearly negligible.\nGiven recent observational indications that supernovae accompany some if not all GRBs\nof the \"long-soft\" variety (e.g., Woosley & Bloom 2005), rotation is apparently important\nin at least some explosions. Otherwise no relativistic jet would form. Indeed, the only\npossibilities are a pulsar with very strong magnetic field and rotation rate \u223c 1 ms (e.g.,\nWheeler, Yi, H\u00f6flich, & Wang 2000) and a rapidly rotating black hole with an accretion disk\n(Woosley 1993; MacFadyen & Woosley 1999). Both require angular momenta considerably\nin excess of any model is Table 3 except those that did not include magnetic torques.\nWe shall address this subject in a subsequent paper, but for now note a possible important symmetry braking condition - the presence of a red supergiant envelope. The most\ncommon supernovae - Type IIp - will result from stars that spent an extended evolutionary\nperiod with a rapidly rotating helium core inside a nearly stationary hydrogen envelope.\nGRBs on the other hand come from Type Ic supernovae, the explosions of stars that lost\ntheir envelopes either to winds or binary companions. Whether a comprehensive model can\nbe developed within the current framework that accommodates both a slow rotation rate for\npulsars at birth and a rapid one for GRBs remains to be seen but we are hopeful.\nAs noted in \u00a72, the magnetic torques have been computed assuming that the dynamo\nprocess is always close to steady state. The time to reach this steady state scales as some\nsmall multiple of the time for an Alfv\u00e9n wave to travel around the star along the toroidal\nfield. This time is very short throughout most of the evolution, but in the latest stages it\neventually becomes longer than the time scale on which the moment of inertia of the core\nchanges. After this, the dynamo effectively stops tracking the changing conditions and the\nfield is frozen in (its components varying as 1/r 2 , for homologous contraction). With the\ndata in Tables 1 and 2, we can estimate the effect this would have on the angular momentum\nloss from the core. The Alfv\u00e9n crossing time first exceeds the evolution time around the end\nof carbon burning. Evolving the field under frozen-in conditions from this time on then\nturns out to produce field strengths that do not differ greatly (less than a factor of 4) from\nthose shown in Table 2. Since the angular momentum of the core does not change by more\nthan 5 % after carbon burning, the effect of using frozen field conditions instead of a steady\ndynamo is therefore small.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nThis research was supported, in part, by the NSF (AST 02-06111), NASA (NAG512036), and the DOE Program for Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC; DE-FC02-01ER41176).
