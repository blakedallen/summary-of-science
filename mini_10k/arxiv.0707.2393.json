We prove: a properly embedded, genus-one minimal surface that\nis asymptotic to a helicoid and that contains two straight lines must intersect\nthat helicoid precisely in those two lines. In particular, the two lines divide the\nsurface into two connected components that lie on either side of the helicoid.\nWe prove an analogous result for periodic helicoid-like surfaces. We also give\na simple condition guaranteeing that an immersed minimal surface with finite\ngenus and bounded curvature is asymptotic to a helicoid at infinity.\n\n1. Introduction and Statement of Results\nIn this paper we consider properly immersed minimal surfaces S \u2282 R3 that\nhave one end asymptotic to the helicoid and genus equal to one. We will call\nsuch a surface a nonperiodic genus-one helicoid. We are interested in embedded,\nnonperiodic genus-one helicoids. Without loss of generality, we may assume that\nS is asymptotic to a vertical helicoid whose axis is the z-axis, Z. If S contains Z\nand one horizontal line we will refer to S as a symmetric, nonperiodic genus-one\nhelicoid. Schwarz reflection about the lines on the surface provides the symmetries.\nWithout loss of generality we may assume that the horizontal line is the x-axis, X,\nand that S is asymptotic to the standard helicoid H, half of which is parametrized\nby\n(1)\n\n(r, \u03b8) \u2192 (r cos \u03b8, r sin \u03b8, \u03b8),\n\nr \u2208 [0, \u221e), \u03b8 \u2208 R. (The other half is obtained by Schwartz reflection about Z.)\nNote that X \u222a Z \u2282 H.\nHoffman, Weber and Wolf [WHW] proved the existence of a symmetric, embedded, nonperiodic genus-one helicoid. In [HW] we gave a variational construction\nfor such surfaces. The examples we constructed in that paper have the following\nproperty:\nS \u2229 H = X \u222a Z, and\n(2)\nS \\ H consists of two congruent, simply connected components.\nDate: July 16, 2007.

Let S \u2217 = S \u2229 {z| \u2212 h < z \u2264 h}, and note that S \u2217 is a fundamental\ndomain for S. If S contains Z and if S \u2217 contains two horizontal lines, then we will\nrefer to S as a symmetric, periodic genus-one helicoid. Without loss of generality,\nwe may assume that X \u2282 S \u2217 , which implies that the other horizontal line in S \u2217\nis \u03c3h (X). For h > \u03c0/2, such surfaces were proved to exist in [HKW99, WHW],\nand by variational means in [HW]. Without loss of generality, we may assume that\n{z = h} \u2229 S = \u03c3h (X), which implies that S \u2217 is bounded by two lines. This follows,\nfor example, from Lemma 1(vii) of [WHW] together with an application of the\nmaximum principle. Define X \u2217 = X \u222a \u03c3h (X). The construction in [HW] produces\nperiodic surfaces satisfying an analog of (2) above:\n(4)\n\nS \u2217 \u2229 H = X \u2217 \u222a Z \u2217 , and\n\nS \u2217 \\ H consists of two symmetric, simply connected components,\n\nwhere Z \u2217 = {(0, 0, t)| \u2212 h < t \u2264 h}. In this paper, we prove that every embedded,\nsymmetric, periodic genus-one helicoid satisfies (4). This is Theorem 2.7.\nWe prove in Theorems 2.5 and 2.7 that embedded symmetric genus-one helicoids\nhave simple intersections with all rotations of H:\nLet \u0124 be the result of rotating H about the z-axis, Z, through an angle in (0, \u03c0).\nIf S is nonperiodic, then S \u2229 \u0124 consists of Z together with a smooth embedded\nclosed curve that intersects Z twice, once above and once below the xy-plane. If S\nis periodic, S \u2217 \u2229 \u0124 consists of Z \u2217 together with a smooth embedded closed curve\nthat intersects Z \u2217 twice, once above and once below the xy-plane.\nSection 2 concludes with a uniqueness result for half-helicoids, Theorem 2.11:\nSuppose M is a connected minimal surface that lies in the closure of a component\nof R3 \\ H, with \u2202M lying in the closure of a component, \u03a3, of H \\ Z. If M is\nbounded or if M is asymptotic to \u03a3, then M \u2282 \u03a3. The proof of this result uses the\nfact that R3 \\ Z is foliated by half-helicoids. Our approach is close to that taken\nby Hardt and Rosenberg in [HR90].\nAs mentioned above, [WHW] and [HW] proved existence of \u03c32h -invariant, symmetric genus-one helicoids for every h > \u03c0/2. In Theorem 3.4 of Section 3.3, we\nprove that the condition h > \u03c0/2 is necessary: for h \u2264 \u03c0/2, there are no embedded,\nsymmetric, periodic genus-g helicoids (with g \u2265 1) invariant under the screw motion \u03c32h . To our knowledge, this was first observed by Bill Meeks for h < \u03c0/2. Our\n\n\fTHE GEOMETRY OF GENUS-ONE HELICOIDS\n\n3\n\nresult requires only the presence of two horizontal lines in S/\u03c32h (no assumption\nthat S contains the axis Z). This proof uses Proposition 5.1, which gives estimates\nof the radial decay of the vertical distance between the end of a symmetric, periodic\ngenus-one helicoid and the end of a helicoid. We use the same estimates to prove\n(Theorem 5.4) that the \u03c32h -invariant, helicoid-like surfaces constructed in [HW] are\nasymptotic to helicoids and thus are in fact periodic genus-one helicoids.\nIn Section 4, we investigate the geometry of properly immersed minimal surfaces\nwith finite genus and one end. With a few additional assumptions, we prove that\nsuch a surface is asymptotic to a helicoid:\nLet S \u2282 R3 be a properly immersed minimal surface with finite genus, one end\nand bounded Gauss curvature. Suppose that S contains X \u222a Z, and that one level\nset {x3 = c} \u2229 S has precisely one divergent component and a finite number of\nsingular points. Then S is conformally a compact Riemann surface punctured in\none point corresponding to the end, and that end is asymptotic to a helicoid.\nThis is Theorem 4.1. This result gives another proof that the genus-one surfaces\nconstructed in [HW] are asymptotic to the helicoid. The method of proof here is a\nslight generalization of the method used in that paper. (See Theorem 6.1 in [HW].)\n2. Structural properties of symmetric genus-one helicoids\nAn embedded, nonperiodic genus-one helicoid S \u2282 R3 is a properly embedded\nminimal surface in R3 that is asymptotic to the helicoid at infinity. Without loss\nof generality, we will assume that S is asymptotic to the helicoid H defined in the\nfirst paragraph of the Introduction. The surface H is a right-handed helicoid that\ncontains Z and X. We say that S is symmetric if it contains Z and X. Similarly,\nan embedded, periodic genus-one helicoid is a properly embedded minimal surface\nS \u2282 R3 invariant under a screw motion (3), such that S/\u03c32h has genus one and\ntwo helicoidal ends. We say that S is symmetric if Z \u2282 S, and the fundamental\ndomain S \u2217 = S \u2229 {\u2212h < z \u2264 h} contains X \u2217 = X \u222a \u03c3h (X).\nIn this section we will prove that embedded, symmetric genus-one helicoids are\ncut by H precisely along X \u222a Z into two congruent simply connected domains.\nWe also prove the analogous result for periodic genus-one helicoids. The technique\ninvolves the study of minimal surfaces with boundary lying in a half-helicoid.\n2.1. Removal of the axes results in two congruent, simply connected domains. We begin by showing that removal of X \u222a Z from a properly embedded,\nnonperiodic, symmetric genus-one helicoid produces two congruent, simply connected domains. Similarly, removal of X \u2217 \u222a Z \u2217 from a fundamental domain of\na properly embedded, periodic, symmetric genus-one helicoid also produces two\ncongruent simply connected domains.\n\n\f4\n\nDAVID HOFFMAN AND BRIAN WHITE\n\n2.2. Lemma. Suppose S is a properly embedded, nonperiodic symmetric genus-one\nhelicoid. Then S \\ Z and S \\ X are annuli, and S \\ (X \u222a Z) is a pair of congruent,\nsimply connected domains.\n2.3. Lemma. Suppose S is a properly embedded, periodic, symmetric genus-one\nhelicoid invariant under \u03c32h . Let S \u2217 = {\u2212h < z \u2264 h} be a fundamental domain\nof S, and Z \u2217 = Z \u2229 {\u2212h < z \u2264 h}. Then S \u2217 \\ Z \u2217 and S \u2217 \\ X \u2217 are annuli, and\nS \u2217 \\ (Z \u2217 \u222a X \u2217 ) is a pair of congruent, simply connected domains.\nProof of Lemma 2.2. The surface S is topologically a once-punctured torus. (In\nfact by Theorem 4.1, S is conformally a once-punctured torus, but we will not\nuse that here.) Thus the one-point compactification T = S \u222a {\u221e} is a torus and\nZ \u222a {\u221e} is a simple closed curve in T . Removing a simple closed curve from a\ntorus either separates it into a disk and a once-punctured torus, or else results in a\nsingle annulus.\nThe rotation \u03c1Z is an isometry of S that leaves Z invariant. Therefore, Z cannot\ndivide T into a disk and punctured torus, because these pieces would have to be\nhomeomorphic (by the involution \u03c1Z ). Thus the result is a single annulus A.\nFor similar reasons, X, viewed as a curve in T , is a simple closed curve. The\nsame argument shows that removal of X from T produces an annulus.\nNote that Z and X cross at the origin and at the point at infinity. These two\npoints are represented as points on the boundary of the annulus A = T \\ Z. The\npositive ray of X is a simple curve in A going from one boundary point to another.\nIf it went from one boundary component of A to the same boundary component, it\nwould divide A into two components, one a disk, the other an annulus. But if there\nwere two components, they would be homeomorphic (by \u03c1X ). Thus, the positive\nray of X goes from one boundary component of A to the other, and removing it\nresults in a disk. Now removing the negative ray of X divides that disk into two\ndisks. The two disks are congruent since they are related by the isometry \u03c1X\n\u0003\nProof of Lemma 2.3. Note that the one-point compactification of S \u2229{\u2212h < z < h}\nis a torus T . The proof of Lemma 2.3 is exactly the same as the proof of Lemma 2.2,\nexcept that one replaces S and Z by S \u2229 {\u2212h < z < h} and Z \u2229 {\u2212h < z < h}. \u0003\n2.4. The decomposition theorem for nonperiodic symmetric genus-one\nhelicoids. The helicoid H divides R3 into two simply connected regions. Let H +\nbe the region that contains Y + , the positive ray of the y-axis, and let H \u2212 be the\nother region. The axis Z is contained in the helicoid H, and H \\ Z consists of two\nsimply connected components, each of which is we will refer to as a half helicoid.\nWe will denote by \u03a30 the half-helicoid that contains the X + , the positive x-axis.\nMore generally, let us extend the definition of a half-helicoid to include any\nsurface obtained by rotating one of the components of H \\ Z through some angle\n\n\fTHE GEOMETRY OF GENUS-ONE HELICOIDS\n\n5\n\nabout Z. Thus the half-helicoids form a foliation of R3 \\ Z. In particular, rotating\n\u03a30 through angles in (0, \u03c0) produces a foliation of H + .\n2.5. Theorem. Let S be an embedded, nonperiodic, symmetric genus-one helicoid.\nThen\n1. S \\ (X \u222a Z) consists of two simply connected, congruent components D and D\u2032 .\n2. D and D\u2032 lie in R3 \\ H, one in H + , the other in H \u2212 .\n3. Let \u0124 be a helicoid obtained by rotating H about Z through an angle in (0, \u03c0).\nThen D \u2229 \u0124 (resp. D\u2032 \u2229 \u0124) is a smooth embedded curve with one endpoint in\nZ + and the other endpoint in Z \u2212 .\nHere Z + and Z \u2212 are the components of Z \\ {O} where z > 0 and z < 0,\nrespectively.\nProof. Statement 1 is Lemma 2.2. It remains to prove statements 2 and 3. We\nbegin by observing that by assumption S contains the axes X and Z and \u2202D =\n\u2202D\u2032 = X \u222a Z. Let \u03c1X and \u03c1Y denote rotations by \u03c0 about X and Y , respectively.\nThese symmetries are orientation-reversing on S, and it is easy to see that they\ninterchange D and D\u2032 . It follows that their composition, \u03c1Y = \u03c1X \u25e6 \u03c1Z , rotation\nby \u03c0 about the axis Y , leaves D and D\u2032 invariant and preserves orientation on S.\nIf p \u2208 R3 \\ Z, let \u03a3(p) be the half-helicoid that contains p. If p \u2208 Z \\ {0}, let\n\u03a3(p) be the half-helicoid with the property that \u03a3(p) and D have the same tangent\nhalf-plane at p. Note that\n(5)\nIf p \u2208 Z \\ {0}, then D \u2229 \u03a3(p) contains a smooth curve, one of whose endpoints is p.\nSince D \\ Z is simply connected, there is a smooth function\n\u03b8 :D\\Z \u2192R\nsuch that\n(6)\n\nq = (x, y, z) = (r cos \u03b8, r sin \u03b8, z)\np\nfor q \u2208 D \\ Z, where r = r(x, y, z) = x2 + y 2 . We may normalize \u03b8 so that\n(7)\n\n\u03b8 = 0 on X + ,\n\nwhere X + is the positive x-axis. It follows that for some integer k,\n(8)\n\n\u03b8 = (2k + 1)\u03c0 on X \u2212 ,\n\nwhere X \u2212 = \u03c1Y (X + ), the negative x-axis. Since D \\ {0} is a smooth manifold with\nboundary X \u222a Z \\ {0}, the function \u03b8 extends smoothly to Z \\ {0}. Thus \u03b8 is a\nsmooth function on D \\ {0}.\nSince \u03b8 = 0 on X + and \u03b8 = (2k + 1)\u03c0 on X \u2212 , extending \u03b8 to 0 is somewhat\nproblematic. We get around that by using the geodesic completion D\u2217 of D \\ {0}.\n\n\f6\n\nDAVID HOFFMAN AND BRIAN WHITE\n\nNote that D\u2217 is D \\ {0} together with two points, 0+ and 0\u2212 , which are the limits\nof (x, 0, 0) as x \u2193 0 and x \u2191 0, respectively. We let\n(9)\n\n\u03b8(0+ ) = 0 and \u03b8(0\u2212 ) = (2k + 1)\u03c0,\n\nwhich makes \u03b8 continuous on all of D\u2217 .\nWe now use the \u03c1Y symmetry of D. Since \u03c1Y (x, y, z) = (\u2212x, y, \u2212z),\ncos(\u03b8 \u25e6 \u03c1Y ) = \u2212 cos \u03b8 and sin(\u03b8 \u25e6 \u03c1Y ) = sin \u03b8,\nfrom which it follows that \u03b8 \u25e6 \u03c1Y and \u2212\u03b8 differ by an odd multiple of \u03c0. In fact,\nsince \u03c1Y (X + ) = X \u2212 , it follows from (7) and (8) that\n(10)\n\n\u03b8 \u25e6 \u03c1Y = \u2212\u03b8 + (2k + 1)\u03c0.\n\nSince D is a disk and \u03c1Y is an orientation-preserving isometric involution of D,\n\u03c1Y has a unique fixed point. That is, D \u2229 Y is a single point. Without loss of\ngenerality, we can assume that this fixed point is in H + . (Since D\u2032 = \u03c1Z (D), we\ncan simply relabel the disks.) In particular,\n(11)\n\nD \u2229 Y \u2212 = \u2205,\n\nwhere Y \u2212 is the negative y-axis. Let\n(12)\n\nF :D\u2192R\nF : (x, y, z) 7\u2192 \u03b8(x, y, z) \u2212 z.\n\nThe function F is connected to the geometry of our situation by the following\nelementary observation:\n(13)\n\nF is constant on every half-helicoid.\n\nThus statements 2 and 3 become statements about the function F . In particular,\nwe will prove statement 2 by proving that F (D) = (0, \u03c0).\nClaim 1: F has no local maxima or local minima on D.\nProof of Claim 1. Suppose F has a local maximum or minimum at p \u2208 D. Let B\nbe a ball centered at p, small enough so that B is disjoint from Z and that D \u2229 B\nis connected. Then there is a unique continuous extension of \u03b8 to D \u222a B so that\n(6) still holds. Note that if we use this extended \u03b8 together with (12) to define F\non B, then it follows from (13) that\n{q \u2208 B : F (q) = F (p)} = \u03a3(p) \u2229 B.\nThus D \u2229 B lies in the closure of one the connected components of B \\ \u03a3(p), and\nD\u2229B and \u03a3(p)\u2229B are tangent at p. By the maximum principle, D\u2229B and \u03a3(p)\u2229B\ncoincide. By analyticity, all of D is contained in a helicoid, a contradiction.\n\u0003\nClaim 2: F has no local maxima or local minima on Z \\ {0}.\n\n\fTHE GEOMETRY OF GENUS-ONE HELICOIDS\n\n7\n\nProof of Claim 2. Suppose p \u2208 Z \\{0}. Since \u03a3(p) and D\\{0} are minimal surfaces\nwith boundary and since they are tangent at p, D \u2229 \u03a3(p) contains a smooth curve\nC with p as one of its endpoints. Note that F is constant along C by (13). By\nClaim 1, none of the points of C is a local maximum or local minimum of F . Thus\np is neither a local maximum nor a local minimum of F .\n\u0003\nClaim 3: Suppose \u03b1 is not an integral multiple of \u03c0. Then either F \u22121 (\u03b1) is empty,\nor it is a single smooth curve with one endpoint on Z + and the other endpoint on\nZ \u2212.\nProof of Claim 3. Suppose p \u2208 C = F \u22121 (\u03b1). Then C \u2282 \u03a3(p). Note that D is\nasymptotic to H at infinity and \u03a3(p) is not (because \u03b1 is not an integral multiple\nof \u03c0), so C lies in a bounded region of R3 . Now C cannot contain a closed curve,\nbecause then that curve would bound a region in D, and F would have an interior\nmaximum or minimum in that region, violating Claim 1. Thus each connected\ncomponent T of C has the structure of a tree whose endpoints are on X \u2229 Z. Since\nF = 0 on X + and F = (2k + 1)\u03c0 on X \u2212 , the endpoints must be on Z. Since 0 and\n(2k + 1)\u03c0 are the only subsequential limits of F (p) as p \u2192 0, in fact the endpoints\nof T must be on Z \\ {0}.\nNow T cannot have two endpoints on Z + . For if it did, T would contain a curve\n\u0393 joining those endpoints, and that curve together with the interval I \u2282 Z joining\nthe endpoints would bound a region U in D. Since F is constant on \u0393, F would\nhave a local maximum or a local minimum at some point p \u2208 U \u222a I. But that is\nimpossible by Claims 1 and 2.\nThus T has at most one endpoint on Z + and (by the same reasoning) at most\none endpoint on Z \u2212 . It follows that T is a smooth curve joining a point on Z + to\na point on Z \u2212 .\nWe have shown: C = F \u22121 (\u03b1) is a union of disjoint curves, each of which joins a\npoint in Z + to a point in Z \u2212 . Furthermore, there cannot be more than one such\ncurve. For if there were two such curves T1 and T2 , then those curves together\nwith a pair of intervals I + and I \u2212 (in Z + and Z \u2212 , respectively) would bound a\nregion U . Since F is not constant on \u016a , its maximum on \u016a is greater than \u03b1 or its\nminimum on \u016a is less than \u03b1. Thus F has a local maximum or a local minimum\non U \u222a I + \u222a I \u2212 . But that is impossible by Claims 1 and 2.\n\u0003\nClaim 4: If p \u2208 Y \u2212 , then D \u2229 \u03a3(p) = \u2205.\nProof of Claim 4. Note that D \u2229 \u03a3(p) is the union of F \u22121 (\u03b1) over all \u03b1 that are\ncongruent to 3\u03c0/2 mod 2\u03c0. Thus if D \u2229 \u03a3(p) were nonempty, by Claim 3 it would\ncontains a curve joining Z + to Z \u2212 . But any such curve in \u03a3(p) must cross Y \u2212 ,\nand D does not contain any points in Y \u2212 . Thus D \u2229 \u03a3(p) = \u2205.\n\u0003\n\n\f8\n\nDAVID HOFFMAN AND BRIAN WHITE\n\nBy Claim 4, the set F (D) does not contain any values equal to 3\u03c0/2 mod 2\u03c0.\nIn particular, it contains neither \u2212\u03c0/2 nor 3\u03c0/2. Since D is connected, F (D) is an\ninterval. Since F |D has no local maxima or local minima, F (D) is an open interval\n(a, b). From (9), [a, b] contains 0 and (2k + 1)\u03c0. Thus\n(14)\n\nF (D) = (a, b), where \u2212\u03c0/2 \u2264 a \u2264 0 and \u03c0 \u2264 b \u2264 3\u03c0/2,\n\nand k = 0. In particular, from (10) we have\n\u03b8 \u25e6 \u03c1Y = \u2212\u03b8 + \u03c0.\n\n(15)\nClaim 5: a = 0 and b = \u03c0.\n\nProof of Claim 5. If b 6= \u03c0, then by (14), \u03c0 < b \u2264 3\u03c0/2. Let bi \u2208 (\u03c0/2, b) with\nbi \u2192 b. Then F \u22121 (bi ) is nonempty, and by Claim 4, it must contain a point pi in\nthe xy-plane. Note that pi has the form\npi = (ri cos bi , ri sin bi , 0)\nwhere ri > 0. By passing to a subsequence, we may assume that the ri converge\nto a limit r \u2208 [0, \u221e]. Now r cannot be 0 since \u03b8(0+ ) = 0 and \u03b8(0\u2212 ) = \u03c0. Also, r\ncannot be a finite nonzero number since otherwise F would attain its maximum,\ncontradicting Claim 1.\nFinally, if ri \u2192 \u221e, then dist(pi , H) \u2192 b \u2212 \u03c0 > 0, which is impossible since D is\nasymptotic to H at infinity. The contradiction proves that b = \u03c0. The proof that\na = 0 is essentially the same. (It also follows from the \u03c1Y symmetry of D.)\n\u0003\nSince F (D) = (0, \u03c0), it follows that D intersects only those half-helicoids produced by rotating \u03a30 through an angle in (0, \u03c0). As observed in the paragraph just\nbefore the statement of the theorem, those half-helicoids foliate H + , so D lies in\nH + . It follows that D\u2032 = \u03c1Y D lies in H \u2212 = \u03c1Y H + . This completes the proof of\nstatement 2 of the theorem.\nStatement 3 of the theorem follows from Claim 3, together with the fact that\nF (D) = (0, \u03c0).\n\u0003\n2.6. The decomposition theorem for periodic symmetric genus-one helicoids. There is an analogous result to Theorem 2.5 for periodic, symmetric genusone helicoids.\n2.7. Theorem.

The proof\nof Theorem 2.6 is a straightforward adaptation of the proof of Theorem 2.5. (Statement 1 was already proved in Lemma 2.2.)\n2.8. A Half-helicoid uniqueness theorem. We end this section with a uniqueness theorem for minimal surfaces that lie in the closure of a component of R3 \\ H,\nand that are either compact or asymptotic to H at infinity.\n2.9. Definition. Let S be an unbounded, oriented, embedded surface in R3 . We\nsay that another surface M is asymptotic to S at infinity provided there is a domain\n\u03a9 \u2282 S and a function u : \u03a9 \u2192 R such that\n(16)\n\nlim (|u(p)| + |Du(p)|) = 0\n\n|p|\u2192\u221e\n\nand such that outside of a compact subset of R3 , the surface M coincides with the\ngraph\n{p + u(p)\u03bd(p) : p \u2208 \u03a9},\nwhere \u03bd(p) is the unit normal to S at p.\n2.10. Remark. If M and S have compact boundaries and bounded principal curvatures, then the C 1 condition (16) follows (by an Arzela-Ascoli type argument)\nfrom the analogous C 0 condition lim|p|\u2192\u221e |u(p)| = 0.\n2.11. Theorem. Let \u03a3 be one of the components of H\\Z. Suppose M is a connected\nminimal surface in H + \\ Z such that \u2202M \u2282 \u03a3 and such that M is either bounded\nor asymptotic to \u03a3 at infinity.\nThen M is a subset of \u03a3.\nProof. We may assume without loss of generality that \u03a3 is the component of H \\ Z\ncontaining the positive x-axis. We may also assume that M is bounded: To see this,\nrotate M about Z through an angle \u2212\u01eb and intersect with H + to get a new minimal\nsurface M (\u01eb). If M were a counterexample to the theorem, then for sufficiently\nsmall \u01eb > 0, the surface M (\u01eb) would also be a counterexample. Furthermore, M (\u01eb)\nis bounded since M is asymptotic to \u03a3.\nThus from now on we assume that M is bounded.\nLet C be a closed, solid circular cylinder of finite height that contains M and\nwhose axis of symmetry is Z. Let \u0393 be the boundary of C \u2229 \u03a3. Minimize area\namong disks in H + with boundary \u0393 and with M as an obstacle (i.e., among disks\n\u2206 such that M is contained in the closed region bounded by \u2206 \u222a (C \u2229 \u03a3).) Call\nthe resulting disk D.\nLet \u03a3\u2032 be the half-helicoid H \\ (Z \u222a \u03a3). Rotate \u03a3\u2032 in H + until it touches D\nat an interior point or until it becomes tangent to D at some point of the interval\nI := \u0393 \u2229 Z.

In case 2, D is\ncontained in \u03a3\u2217 by the boundary maximum principle. In case 3, \u03a3\u2217 = \u03a3 (since D\nand \u03a3 are tangent at the endpoints of I) and thus D is contained in \u03a3\u2217 .\nIn all three cases, we have shown that D is contained in \u03a3\u2217 . Since \u2202D \u2282 \u03a3, this\nimplies that \u03a3\u2217 = \u03a3. Since M lies between \u03a3 and \u03a3\u2217 , in fact M is contained in\n\u03a3.\n\u0003\n3.

Nonexistence of examples with h \u2264 \u03c0/2. We will use Lemma 3.2 to prove\n3.4. Theorem. Let S be a properly immersed minimal surface that lies in the slab\n{\u2212h \u2264 z \u2264 h} and that is bounded by the two lines H \u2229 {z = h} and H \u2229 {z = \u2212h},\nwhere H is the standard helicoid (1). Suppose that S is asymptotic1 to\nH \u2229 {\u2212h \u2264 z \u2264 h}.\nIf h \u2264 \u03c0/2, then S = H \u2229 {\u2212h \u2264 z \u2264 h}.\nAs a corollary we have\n3.5. Theorem. Suppose that S is a properly immersed minimal surface invariant\nunder a screw motion \u03c32h with h \u2264 \u03c0/2, and that S is asymptotic to H as r =\np\nx2 + y 2 tends to infinity. If the intersection of S with some horizontal plane is a\nline, then S = H.\nProof of Theorem 3.5. Without loss of generality we may assume that S\u2229{z = \u2212h}\nis a line. By the \u03c32h invariance, S \u2229 {z = h} must also be a line. Since S is\nasymptotic to H away from Z, these lines must be the lines H \u2229 {z = \u2212h} and\nH \u2229 {z = h}. Thus S \u2229 {\u2212h \u2264 z \u2264 h} satisfies the hypotheses of Theorem 3.4, from\nwhich we conclude that S = H.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 3.4. By assumption, outside of any sufficiently large cylinder\nCR = {x2 + y 2 \u2264 R2 , |z| \u2264 h}, one end of S is a graph of the form\n{(r cos \u03b8, r sin \u03b8, \u03b8 + f (r, \u03b8)) : \u2212h \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 h, r > R},\nwith f (\u2212h, r) = f (h, r) = 0. (A similar discussion applies to the other end. Indeed,\nafter rotation by \u03c1Z , the other end has the same form.) By Proposition 5.1(20),\n\u2202f\n= o(r\u2212\u03b2 ),\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u22022f\n= o(r\u2212\u03b2 )\n\u2202\u03b82\nfor every \u03b2 < \u03c0/2h. Since h \u2264 \u03c0/2, these estimates hold for every \u03b2 < 1.\nLet SR = S \u2229 CR be the portion of S inside the cylinder CR . Note that \u2202SR is\nan extremal curve: it lies on the boundary of the convex set CR \u2229 {|z| \u2264 h}.\nClaim. For R sufficiently large, the total curvature of \u2202SR is strictly less than\n4\u03c0.\nProof of Claim. The curve \u2202SR consists of two line segments-one on the top and\none on the bottom disk of \u2202CR -and two nearly helical curves on \u2202CR . There are\nfour corners where the curves and the line segments meet orthogonally.\n1See Definition 2.9.\n\n\f12\n\nDAVID HOFFMAN AND BRIAN WHITE\n\nBy Lemma 3.2, each of the two nearly helical arcs has total curvature strictly\nless than 2h, provided R is sufficiently large. Thus \u2202SR has total curvature strictly\nless than\n2(2h) + 4(\u03c0/2) = 4h + 2\u03c0 \u2264 4\u03c0\nsince h \u2264 \u03c0/2 and since each corner contributes \u03c0/2 to the total curvature.\n\n\u0003\n\nWe now apply the following uniqueness result :\n3.6. Theorem. A smooth, extremal Jordan curve with total curvature at most 4\u03c0\nbounds precisely one minimal surface and that minimal surface is an embedded disk.\nMeeks and Yau [MY82] prove that a smooth, extremal Jordan curve either\nbounds two distinct embedded minimal disks or it bounds a unique minimal disk\nand no other minimal surface of any genus. Together with the result of Nitsche\n[Nit73] that a smooth Jordan curve with total curvature not greater than 4\u03c0 bounds\na unique minimal disk, they arrive at Theorem 3.6.\nThe curve \u2202SR we are dealing with has four corners that can be smoothed in the\nsurface with an arbitrarily small increase in total curvature, so that the smoothed\ncurve will also have total curvature strictly less than 4\u03c0. Hence by Theorem 3.6\n(applied to the smoothed curve), SR is simply connected for all sufficiently large\nR, and therefore S is simply connected.\nThus the surface obtained from S by repeated Schwarz reflection about the\nboundary lines is a nonplanar, singly periodic, embedded and simply connected\nminimal surface. By a theorem of Meeks and Rosenberg [MR93], the only such\nsurface is the helicoid.\n\u0003\n3.7. Remark. For h < \u03c0/2, it is also possible to prove Theorem 3.4, without\nrecourse to Theorem 3.6, as follows. The decay estimates of Proposition 5.1 can be\nused to show that (for R sufficiently large) the curve \u2202SR projects monotonically\nto the boundary of a convex region \u03a9 in the plane {x = 0}. (One shows that the\ncurvature at each point of the projections of the perturbed helical arcs is strictly\npositive.) By a theorem of Rado (see for example Sections 398 and 400 in Nitsche\n[Nit89]), SR must be a graph over \u03a9. In particular, SR must be simply connected.\nIf h = \u03c0/2, the curve \u2202SR still projects monotonically to the boundary of a\nregion \u03a9 in the plane {x = 0}. However, convexity of \u03a9 at the projections of the\ncorner points of \u2202SR seems to be delicate. In particular, the convexity does not\nseem to follow from the decay estimates in Proposition 5.1.\n4. Asymptotic behavior of symmetric, properly immersed minimal\nsurfaces with one end and finite topology.\nThe goal of this section is to prove the following theorem:\n\n\fTHE GEOMETRY OF GENUS-ONE HELICOIDS\n\n13\n\n4.1. Theorem. Let S \u2282 R3 be a properly immersed, nonplanar minimal surface\nwith finite genus, one end, and bounded curvature. Suppose\n1. S contains X \u222a Z, and\n2. for some value of c, {x3 = c} \u2229 S has precisely one divergent component.\nThen S is conformally a once-punctured Riemann surface, and S is asymptotic to\na helicoid.\nNote that any level set M \u2229 {z = c} of a properly embedded minimal surface\nM \u2282 R3 can be decomposed uniquely as a union of connected C 1 , properly immersed curves, all intersections and self-intersections of which are transverse. The\nintersection points are precisely the points of tangency of M and the plane {z = c}.\nThus hypothesis 2 of Theorem 4.1 is equivalent to: there are only finitely many\npoints of tangency of {z = c} and M , and M \u2229 {z = c} can be written as the union\nof finitely many connected C 1 immersed curves, exactly one of which is not closed.\n4.2. Remark. Our proof of Theorem 4.1 is similar to the proof in [HW, \u00a76.1]\nthat the surfaces constructed in that paper are conformally punctured tori and are\nasymptotic to a helicoid at infinity.\nProof of Theorem 4.1. The surface S satisfies the hypotheses of the following theorem of Rodriguez and Rosenberg [RR98]:\nSuppose S \u2282 R3 is a properly immersed minimal surface with one end and\nwith bounded curvature. Suppose also that at some level x3 = c, the intersection\n{x3 = c} \u2229 S consists of finitely many curves with finitely many intersections. Then\nS is of finite type, i.e., S is conformally a once-punctured Riemann surface, the\npuncture corresponding to the end, and the one-forms dg/g and dh are meromorphic\non the compact surface.\nHere, g is the stereographic projection of the Gauss map from the north pole, and\ndh = dx3 + i dx\u22173 is a holomorphic one form on M . (The function x\u22173 is a harmonic\nconjugate of x3 ; it is locally well-defined up to an additive constant.) Note that dh\nis closed but is not, in general, exact.\nClaim. The one form dh has a double pole at the puncture and no residue. The\none form dg/g also has a double pole at the puncture.\nAssuming the claim, we can complete the proof of the theorem by using the\nfollowing result of Hoffman and McCuan [HM03]: Let E \u2282 R3 be a properly immersed, minimal annular end that is conformally a punctured disk. Suppose that\ndg/g and dh both have double poles at the puncture and that dh has no residue at the\npuncture. If E contains a vertical ray and a horizontal ray, then E is asymptotic\nto a helicoid at infinity.\n\n\f14\n\nDAVID HOFFMAN AND BRIAN WHITE\n\nWe apply this theorem to an end E of S corresponding to a neighborhood of\nthe puncture. That E contains the requisite rays follows from assumption 1 of the\ntheorem.\nProof of Claim. By assumption 2, in a neighborhood of the puncture, the level\ncurve {x3 = c} \u2229 S consists of two smooth curves emanating from the puncture.\nHence dh has a pole of order two at that point. (That dh must have a pole at the\npuncture follows from the maximum principle and the fact that S has one end.)\nSince dh is holomorphic on S, it follows from Stokes' Theorem that dh has no\nresidue at the puncture. In a (possibly smaller) neighborhood of the puncture, dh\ncan be assumed to have no zeros. Since dh has a double pole at the puncture, the\nlevel curves {x3 = a} \u2229 S, for any value of a are embedded in this neighborhood.\nIn particular, S has an embedded end.\nWe claim that dg/g must have a pole at the puncture. For suppose it does not.\nThen g has a well-defined value at the puncture, and g is meromorphic on the onepoint compactification of S. Thus S has finite total curvature ([Oss63], [Oss86]\nChapter 9, [HK97], Section 2.3 ) and, as observed above, an embedded end. Such\nends are asymptotic to a plane or to an end of the catenoid. ([Sch83], [JMI83],\n[HK97], Section 2.3) On a catenoid C, dh has a simple pole at an end (observe\nthat the level curves {x3 = a} \u2229 C are circles that do not pass through the point\ncorresponding to the end.) Therefore, S is asymptotic to a plane, and since it has\none end, the maximum principle implies that it is equal to a plane. Since we are\nassuming that S is nonplanar, the contradiction shows that dg/g has a pole at the\npuncture.\nWe now determine the order of the pole of dg/g at the puncture. First of\nall we will show that the order of the pole is even. Note that on the compact\nRiemann surface S \u222a{\u221e}, the number of zeros minus the number of poles (counting\nmultiplicities) is even. (It is 2(1 \u2212 m) where m is the genus of S.) Hence to show\nthat the pole at the puncture has even order, it suffices to show that\n(i) The number of poles of dg/g on S is even.\n(ii) The number of zeros of dg/g on S \\ {0} is even.\n(iii) The origin (if it is a zero of dg/g) is a zero of even order.\nOn S, dg/g has poles precisely at the zeros and poles of g. Along Z, g is unitary\nso no poles of dg/g occur there. By the 180\u25e6 rotation \u03c1Z about Z, the zeros and\npoles of g are paired, counting multiplicity. Hence, dg/g has an even number of\npoles on S. This establishes (i). The zeros of dg/g occur at branch points of g\n(zeros of the Gauss curvature), and the multiplicity of the zero of dg/g is equal to\nthe branching order of g. Except for the origin, these zeros also occur in pairs (the\npoint p \u2208 S \\ Z being paired with \u03c1Z (p) and q \u2208 Z \\ {0} being paired with \u2212q.)\nThis proves (ii). The tangent plane at the origin is the plane P given by x2 = 0.\nThe 180\u25e6 rotations \u03c1X and \u03c1Z about X and Z are symmetries of S and therefore\n\n\fTHE GEOMETRY OF GENUS-ONE HELICOIDS\n\n15\n\nalso of P \u2229 S. Thus P \u2229 S must have an even number, say 2k, of curves passing\nthrough the origin. The order of branching of g at the origin is then 2(k \u2212 1). This\nestablishes (iii), completing the proof that dg/g has a pole at infinity of even order.\nThe principal curvature function of a minimal surface is given by the expression\n([HK97], page 15)\nk=\n\n\u221a\n\n\u2212K =\n\n4|dg/g|/|dh|\n.\n(|g| + 1/|g|)2\n\nAlong Z, the tangent plane to S is vertical, so g is unitary and\n(18)\n\nk=\n\n|dg/g|\n.\n|dh|\n\nSince the curvature of S is bounded by assumption and since (as we have already\nshown) dh has a pole of order two at the end, we see from (18) that dg/g has a pole\nat infinity of order at most two. Since the order is even, it must be exactly two.\n\u0003\n\n5. Asymptotic behavior of symmetric, periodic, properly embedded\nminimal surfaces with finite topology and one end\nIn this section we give estimates for the rate that a minimal graph with certain\nhelicoidal qualities actually converges to a helicoid. We will use the estimates\nto prove that the periodic examples constructed in [HW] are asymptotic to the\nhelicoid. The estimates of Proposition 5.1 were also used in Section 3, to prove\nthat periodic examples with small twist angles do not exist.\n5.1. Proposition.

The vertical distance function between two minimal graphs satisfies\na linear elliptic equation\nThis is a special case of a well known result for quasilinear, elliptic partial differential equations. (See Gilbarg-Trudinger, [GT98], Chapter 10.) For the reader's\nconvenience we include a proof of the lemma.\nProof of Lemma 5.2.

We will have need of the following\nresult in the proof of Proposition 5.1.\n5.3. Corollary. If un and vn converge uniformly to zero, then Ln converges smoothly\nto the Laplacian on compact subsets of \u03a9.\nProof. Let fi : \u03a9 \u2192 R be a sequence of solutions to the minimal surface equation\nthat converge uniformly to zero, and let K be a compact subset of \u03a9.

Thus, by passing to a further subsequence if necessary, we may assume that the\nfi converge, on compact subsets in the C k norm, to a limit function f . But since\nthe fi converge uniformly to zero, f is the zero function. Hence \u039b = 0.\nWe now apply the conclusion of the previous paragraph to the sequences un and\nvn . From (21), it follows that Ln converges smoothly on compact subsets to the\nLaplacian.\n\u0003\nProof of Proposition 5.1.

The function w is zero on the rays in\n\u2202WA and bounded above on the circular arc of radius A in \u2202WA .

There exists an A\u2032 \u2265 A, such that\nLf < 0 and Lg < 0 on WA\u2032 = {(r, \u03b8)|r \u2265 A\u2032 , |\u03b8| < h}.\nProof of Claim: On S, the half helicoid that is the multigraph of v(r, \u03b8) = \u03b8, the\nnormal is asymptotically vertical as r \u2192 \u221e, and by assumption the same is true for\nS \u2032 , the graph of u(r, \u03b8). Therefore, |Du| \u2192 0 and |Dv| \u2192 0 as r \u2192 \u221e. Moreover it\nis elementary to calculate that |Dv| = O(r\u22121 ) and |D2 v| = O(r\u22122 ).\n\n\f18\n\nDAVID HOFFMAN AND BRIAN WHITE\n\nFrom (21), (23), and the preceding paragraph, we may compute\n(24)\n\nLf\n\n= \u2206f + u22 f1,1 + u21 f2,2 \u2212 2u1 u2 f1,2 + b1 f1 + b2 f2\n\n= Cr\u22122 f + o(1)(f1,1 + f2,2 \u2212 2f1,2 ) + O(r\u22122 )(f1 + f2 ),\nwhere C = (\u03b2 2 \u2212 \u03b12 ) < 0, and the bk are defined in (21).

Since w is\nbounded on WA\u2032 and f is strictly positive on WA\u2032 , there exists a \u03bb > 0 large enough\nso that \u03bbf > w on the circular arc in \u2202WA\u2032 of radius A\u2032 . On the rays in \u2202WA\u2032 , w\nis identically zero and both f and g are strictly positive. Therefore, for any \u01eb > 0,\nw\u0303\u01eb := w \u2212 \u03bbf \u2212 \u01ebg < 0 on \u2202WA\u2032 .\nAlso, for any \u01eb > 0, w\u0303\u01eb (r, \u03b8) is negative for r sufficiently large. (This is because\nw is bounded, f \u2192 0 and g \u2192 \u221e as r \u2192 \u221e.) From Claim 1 we have\nLw\u0303\u01eb > 0 on WA\u2032 .\nBy the maximum principle, we may conclude that w\u0303\u01eb < 0 on WA\u2032 . Since this is\nvalid for any positive \u01eb, it follows that w \u2264 \u03bbf on WA\u2032 , which implies that for any\n\u03c0\n,\n\u03b2 < 2h\nw \u2264 \u03bbr\u2212\u03b2 .\n\nWe can repeat the same argument for \u2212w and conclude that \u2212w \u2264 \u03bbr\u2212\u03b2 .

The theorem is also true for surfaces S with boundary, provided the\nboundary lies within a bounded distance of Z.\nProof. By translation and rotation, we may assume that the line L is X. We will\nallow S to have boundary as indicated in the remark. Let C be the interior of a\nclosed solid cylinder about Z that contains \u2202S. Choose the radius R of the cylinder\nlarge enough that the tangent planes to S \\ C are all nearly horizontal, and so that\nS \u2229 {z = 0} coincides with X outside of C. We may assume that S \u2282 R3 \\ C and\nthat \u2202S \u2282 \u2202C; otherwise replace S by S \\ C.\nLet X + and X \u2212 denote the positive and negative portions of X \\ C:\nX + = {(x, 0, 0) : x \u2265 R}\n\nX \u2212 = {(x, 0, 0) : x \u2264 \u2212R}.\nThus we have\n(31)\n\nS \u2229 {z = 0} = X + \u222a X \u2212 .\n\nNote that each component V of S is a covering space of R2 \\ B(0, R). Since V is\nembedded, it must be either a single-sheeted covering or an infinite covering. Thus\nV can be parametrized as\n(32)\n\n(r, \u03b8) 7\u2192 (r cos \u03b8, r sin \u03b8, f (r, \u03b8))\n\n(r \u2265 R, \u03b8 \u2208 R)\n\nwhere this map is either periodic (with period 2\u03c0) or else one-to-one, according\nto whether V is a single-sheeted or not. Note that if f is not periodic, then by\nproperness f is not bounded above or below.\nNow let V be the component of S containing X + . By the hypothesis about the\nends of L, V cannot be the component of S that contains X \u2212 , nor can it be the\ncomponent that contains any of the rays identified with X \u2212 in S/\u03c3. Thus\n(33)\n\nV \u2229 \u03c3 n X \u2212 = \u2205 for n \u2208 Z.\n\nNote that we can parametrize V as in (32) with a function f satisfying\nf (r, 0) \u2261 0.\nBy Schwartz reflection, f (r, \u2212\u03b8) \u2261 \u2212f (r, \u03b8). In particular, f (r, \u2212\u03c0) = \u2212f (r, \u03c0).\nNow f (r, \u03c0) 6= 0 since V is disjoint from X \u2212 . Thus f (r, \u03c0) 6= f (r, \u2212\u03c0), so f (r, \u03b8)\ndoes not have period 2\u03c0 and therefore is not periodic.\nIt follows (from (31)) that f (r, \u03b8) = 0 if and only if \u03b8 = 0.\nBy reflecting in the plane {z = 0}, if necessary, we may assume that f (r, \u03b8) > 0\nfor \u03b8 > 0. We may also assume that t > 0. (Otherwise replace \u03c3 by \u03c3 \u22121 .) Since\nf is not bounded above, it must intersect the plane {z = t}. By (31) and by the\n\u03c3-invariance,\nS \u2229 {z = t} = \u03c3X + \u222a \u03c3X \u2212 .\n\n\fTHE GEOMETRY OF GENUS-ONE HELICOIDS\n\n21\n\nThus V \u2229 {z = t} must be one or both of the rays \u03c3X \u00b1 . By (33), it must be the\nray \u03c3X + . Let \u0398 be the value of the parameter \u03b8 corresponding to this ray. Then\nwe have:\n0 < f (r, \u03b8) < t\n\nfor 0 < \u03b8 < \u0398,\n\nf (r, 0) \u2261 0, and f (r, \u0398) \u2261 t.\nIf we dilate the surface S by \u03bb > 0, then R, t, and f (r, \u03b8) get replaced by \u03bbR, \u03bbt,\nand f (r/\u03bb, \u03b8), but \u0398 does not change.\nThus by scaling by \u03bb = \u0398/t, we can assume that t = \u0398. Hence \u03c3 = \u03c32h\n(see (3)), where h = t/2. Now V (or more precisely \u03c3\u2212h V ) satisfies the hypotheses\nof Proposition 5.1. Hence V is asymptotic to H with the asserted decay rate.\nLet W be the component of S containing X \u2212 . Exactly the same argument shows\nthat W is also asymptotic (with the asserted decay rate) to some helicoid H \u2032 with\naxis Z and containing X. Note that H \u2032 = H since otherwise V and W would\nintersect.\nFinally, S can have no component other than V and W , because any such component, being trapped between V and W , would have to intersect the plane {z = 0},\nand by (31) the only possible intersections are X + and X \u2212 .\n\u0003\nReferences\n[CM04]\n\nTobias H.
