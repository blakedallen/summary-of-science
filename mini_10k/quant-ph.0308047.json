(14) for\nnon integral values of n \u2208 [0, 20].\n\nMultiple Applications\n\nWe now ask the question, what effect do multiple applications of the channel have on the singlet state? In\norder to answer it, we need to know the form of the singlet state after n applications, denoted by \u03c1n . Proceeding\nfrom Eq. (4),\n\u03c12 = p\u03c11 + (1 \u2212 p)X (\u03c11 )\n\n= (p2 + (1 \u2212 p)2 )\u03c1+ + (p(1 \u2212 p) + (1 \u2212 p)p)X (\u03c1+ )\n(12)\n= P2 \u03c1+ + (1 \u2212 P2 )X (\u03c1+ );\n\nP2 = p2 + (1 \u2212 p)2 .\n\u03c3x2\n\nThe identity\n= I was used to arrive at Eq. (12). Thus\n\u03c12 has exactly the same form as \u03c11 ; repeated applications\nof the channel will not change this form. All that remains\nis to find an expression for Pn . By calculating \u03c1n for the\nfirst few n explicitly, we have\nP0 = 1,\nP1 = p,\n\nP2 = p2 + (1 \u2212 p)2 ,\n\nP3 = p3 + 3p(1 \u2212 p)2 .\n\nD.\n\nCombating the Disentanglement\n\nThe form of the curves in Fig. 3 suggests that perhaps,\nstates further along the curves lose entanglement slower\nthan the singlet. In order to test this, first we define\nthe fractional loss of entanglement the state \u03c1k after r\napplications of the channel as\nF (p, k, r) = \u2212\n\nE(\u03c1k ) \u2212 E(\u03c1k+r )\n;\nE(\u03c1k )\n\n(15)\n\nwhere E(\u03c1) is a measure of the entanglement of \u03c1. Then\nthe fractional loss of entanglement of the singlet state after r applications of the channel is given by F (p, 0, r). In\norder to compare the loss of entanglement of the singlet\nstate with that of \u03c1k , define\nR(p, k, r) =\n\nF (p, k, r)\n.\nF (p, 0, r)\n\n(16)\n\n\f3\n\n1.4\n\n1.2\n\nEF\nED\n\nR(0.9, 15, r)\n\nR(0.9, k, 1)\n\n1.2\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\nEF\nED\n\n0.6\n5\n\n10\n\n15\nk\n\n20\n\n1\n\n25\n\n30\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\nr\n\nR(p, 8, 1)\n\n1.2\n\n1\n\n0.8\nEF\nED\n\n0.6\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\np\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\nFIG. 4: Graphs showing the dependence of R(p, k, r) on p, k and r. It is seen that R behaves differently for different measures\nof entanglement.\n\nFig. 4 illustrates the behavior of R(p, k, r). The most\nstriking feature of the graphs is that the entanglement\nof formation and the distillable entanglement behave in\na qualitatively different manner with regard to the rate\nof loss of entanglement of \u03c1k .The rate of loss of entanglement of formation is higher for \u03c1k than for the singlet\nstate. The reverse is true for the distillable entanglement.\nIt is the distillable entanglement that is of greater practical interest, and the fact that \u03c1k loses it slower than\nthe singlet suggests a simple tactic to combat the disentangling action of this channel. Rather than storing\nentanglement as a few singlets, it should be stored as a\nlarger number of less entangled states of the form of \u03c1k .\nSince the fractional loss of entanglement for these states\nis less than for the singlet, there will be a smaller net loss\nof entanglement over time, provided that the distillable\nentanglement for these states is additive, that is\nED (\u03c1\u2297N\nk ) = N ED (\u03c1k ).\n\n(17)\n\nThis will ensure that the entanglement spread over N\ncopies of these states can be efficiently concentrated into\nsinglet form again.\nThe second graph in Fig. 4 shows that the advantage\nobtained by storing the entanglement in dilute form is\nlost if the system is exposed to noise repeatedly. While\nthis does impose a limit on the savings that can be made,\nif a sufficiently large k is chosen and r is bounded, there\ncan still be significant gains.\n\nThe final graph shows, rather predictably, that the less\nsevere the noise, the greater the gains that can be made,\nfor a given k and r.\n\nIII.\n\nGENERALIZATION\n\nAlthough most of the results in this paper are derived\nfor the bit flip channel, a number of them hold for more\ngeneral noise processes as well. In this section, we will\nanalyze the general noise process\n\u03c11 = p\u03c1+ + (1 \u2212 p)N (\u03c1+ )\nN (\u03c1) : = (I \u2297 n\u0302 * ~\u03c3 )\u03c1(I \u2297 n\u0302 * ~\u03c3 )\n=\n\n1\n3\n1 X X\nna nb |ii hj| \u2297 \u03c3a |ii hj| \u03c3b .\n2 i,j=0\n\n(18)\n\na,b=1\n\nwhere n\u0302 \u2208 R3 is arbitrary. For n\u0302 = (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0) and\n(0, 0, 1), this channel reduces to the bit flip, bit-phase flip\nand phase flip channels respectively [6].\n\nA.\n\nEntanglement of Formation\n\nHere we explicitly calculate the entanglement of formation of \u03c11 , defined in Eq. (18). First we need to evaluate\n\n\f4\n\u03c1 \u03031 = (\u03c3y \u2297 \u03c3y )\u03c11 (\u03c3y \u2297 \u03c3y ). The following identity [7],\ncomes in handy\n(I \u2297 M )\u03c1+ (I \u2297 M \u2020 ) = (M T \u2297 I)\u03c1+ (M \u2217 \u2297 I);\n\n(19)\n\nwhere M is any matrix. As a result of Eq. (19) we get\n\n= (\u03c3y \u2297 \u03c3y )(I \u2297 n\u0302\u2032 * ~\u03c3 )\u03c1+ (1 \u2297 n\u0302\u2032 * ~\u03c3 )(\u03c3y \u2297 \u03c3y )\n1 X\n\u03c3y |ai hb| \u03c3y \u2297 n\u2032i \u03c3y \u03c3i |ai hb| n\u2032j \u03c3j \u03c3y\n=\n2\na,b,i,j\n\n1 X\n\u03c3y |ai hb| \u03c3y \u2297 (\u2212ni )\u03c3i \u03c3y |ai hb| (\u2212nj )\u03c3y \u03c3j\n=\n2\na,b,i,j\n\n(\u03c3y \u2297 \u03c3y )\u03c1\u2217+ (\u03c3y \u2297 \u03c3y )\n= (\u03c3y \u2297 I)(I \u2297 \u03c3y )\u03c1\u2217+ (I \u2297 \u03c3y )(\u03c3y \u2297 I)\n= \u03c1\u2217+ = \u03c1+ .\n\n(20)\n\nDefine n\u0302\u2032 = (nx , \u2212ny , nz ). Then, for the second term in\n\u03c11\n(\u03c3y \u2297 \u03c3y )N (\u03c1+ )\u2217 (\u03c3y \u2297 \u03c3y )\n\n= (I \u2297 n\u0302 * ~\u03c3 )(\u03c3y \u2297 \u03c3y )\u03c1+ (\u03c3y \u2297 \u03c3y )(I \u2297 n\u0302 * ~\u03c3 )\n= N (\u03c1+ ).\n\nEq. (20) and Eq. (21) together imply that \u03c1 \u03031 = \u03c11 .\nThus in order to calculate the concurrence of \u03c11 we need\nto know only its eigenvalues. The matrix is\n\n\uf8f9\nr + n2z\n(nx \u2212 iny )nz (nx + iny )nz\nr \u2212 n2z\n1\u2212p \uf8ef\nn2x + n2y\n(nx + iny )2 \u2212(nx + iny )nz \uf8fa\n\uf8fa;\n\uf8ef(nx + iny )nz\n\u03c11 =\n2\nn2x + n2y\n\u2212(nx \u2212 iny )nz \uf8fb\n2 \uf8f0(nx \u2212 iny )nz (nx \u2212 iny )\nr \u2212 n2z\n\u2212(nx \u2212 iny )nz \u2212(nx + iny )nz\nr + n2z\n\uf8ee\n\nAmazingly enough, the eigenvalues of this matrix are\n{p, 1 \u2212 p, 0, 0} giving a concurrence\nC = |2p \u2212 1|.\n\n(23)\n\nThis is the same result as was obtained for the bit flip\nchannel in Eq. (8). The fact that (n\u0302 * ~\u03c3 )2 = I ensures\nthat\n\u03c1n = Pn \u03c1+ + (1 \u2212 Pn )N (\u03c1+ ).\n\n(24)\n\nIt can easily be demonstrated that this Pn is the same as\nwas obtained for the bit flip channel in Eq. (13). Thus,\nthe analysis carries over entirely for the n\u0302 * ~\u03c3 channel, in\nthe case of entanglement of formation.\nFor the distillable entanglement, the situation is complicated by the absence of any method for calculating the\nentanglement for an arbitrary density matrix. However,\nfor the special cases of n\u0302 = (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0) or (0, 0, 1) \u03c11\nremains in Bell diagonal form. As a result its distillable\nentanglement is easily calculated to be 1 \u2212 h(p), as in Eq.\n(11).\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nNoise reduces bipartite entanglement (of a singlet) exponentially, at a rate that depends on how non uniform\nthe noise probability is. The greater the distance of the\nnoise probability p from 1/2, the less severe the noise.\n\n[1] D. J. A. Welsh, Codes and Cryptography (Oxford University Press, 1988).\n\n(21)\n\nr=\n\np\n.\n1\u2212p\n\n(22)\n\nWhile the noise never totally destroys the entanglement,\nit does make it negligible very quickly.\nInterestingly, noise seems to affect states differently.\nThe distillable entanglement of the singlet reduces faster\nthan that of \u03c1k . Theoretically, this is interesting behavior in itself. There seems to be no a priori reason why\nthe singlet should be more fragile than its less entangled\ncounterparts. Practically, it is of importance as it suggests that entanglement should not be stored in the form\nof singlets.\nThe rate of loss of entanglement of formation was found\nto be the same for the generalized n\u0302 * ~\u03c3 channel as that\nfor the I \u2297 \u03c3x channel. The rate of loss of distillable\nentanglement for the special cases n\u0302 = (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0)\nand (0, 0, 1) was uniformly 1 \u2212 h(p). It is conjectured\nthat this is the rate of loss of distillable entanglement for\narbitrary n\u0302.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI would like to thank Dr. R.
