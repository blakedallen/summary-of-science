The second one is the existence of Regge-pole structure in the high energy string\nscattering amplitudes [2] due to the infinite number of resonances in the string spectrum.\nRecently high-energy, fixed angle behavior of string scattering amplitudes [3, 4, 5] was\nintensively reinvestigated for massive string states at arbitrary mass levels [2, 6, 7, 8, 9,\n10, 11, 12]. An infinite number of linear relations, or stringy symmetries, among string\nscattering amplitudes of different string states were obtained. An important new ingredient\nof these calculations is the zero-norm states (ZNS) [13, 14, 15] in the old covariant first\nquantized (OCFQ) string spectrum. The existence of these infinite linear relations constitutes the third fundamental characteristics of high energy string scatterings, which is not\nshared by the usual point-particle field theory scatterings. These linear relations persist\nfor string scattered from generic Dp-brane [16] except D-instanton and Domain-wall. For\nthe scattering of D-instanton, the form factor exhibits the well-known power-law behavior\nwithout Regge-pole structure, and thus resembles a field theory amplitude. For the special case of Domain-wall scattering, it was discovered [17] recently that, in contrast to the\ncommon wisdom [18], its form factor behaves as power-law with Regge-pole structure. This\ndiscovery makes Domain-wall scatterings an unique example of a hybrid of string and field\ntheory scatterings. Moreover, it was shown [17] that the linear relations break down for\nthe Domain-wall scattering due to this unusual power-law behavior. This result gives a\nstrong evidence that the existence of the infinite linear relations, or stringy symmetries,\nof high-energy string scattering amplitudes is responsible for the softer, exponential fall-off\nhigh-energy string scatterings than the power-law field theory scatterings. It is crucial to\nnote that there is only one kinematic variable for the Domain-wall scatterings in contrast to\ntwo for other generic Dp-brane scatterings with p \u2265 0. This is one of the main reasons that\nforce the high energy behavior of Domain-wall scattering to be the unusual power-law one.\nIn this letter, we calculate the absorption amplitudes of a closed string state at arbitrary\nmass level leading to two open string states on the D-brane at high energies. The corresponding simple case of absorption amplitude for massless closed string state was calculated\nin [19] (The discussion on massless string states scattered from D-brane can be found in\n2\n\n\f[18, 20]).The inverse of this process can be used to describe Hawking radiation in the Dbrane picture. As in the case of Domain-wall scattering discussed above, this process contains\none kinematic variable (energy E) and thus occupies an intermediate position between the\nconventional three-point and four-point amplitudes. However, in contrast to the power-law\nbehavior of high energy Domain-wall scattering which contains only one kinematic variable\n(energy E), its form factor behaves as exponential fall-off at high energies. It is thus of interest to investigate whether the usual linear relations of high energy amplitudes persist for this\ncase or not. As will be shown in this paper, after identifying the geometric parameter of the\nkinematic, one can derive the linear relations (of the kinematic variable) and ratios among\nthe high energy amplitudes corresponding to absorption of different closed string states for\neach fixed mass level by D-brane. This result is consistent with the coexistence [17] of the\nlinear relations and exponential fall-off behavior of high energy string/D-brane amplitudes.\nWe first briefly review the high energy scatterings of four open string states. At a fixed\n2\nmass level Mop\n= 2(n \u2212 1) of 26D open bosonic string theory, it was shown that [9, 10] a\n\nfour-point function is at the leading order at high-energy limit only for states of the following\nform\nT n\u22122m\u22122q\nL 2m\nL q\n|n, 2m, qi \u2261 (\u03b1\u22121\n)\n(\u03b1\u22121\n) (\u03b1\u22122\n) |0, ki .\n\n(1)\n\nwhere n > 2m + 2q, m, q > 0.Note that, in the high energy limit, the scattering process\nbecomes a plane scattering. The state in Eq.(1) is arbitrarily chosen to be the second vertex\nof the four-point function. The other three points can be any string states. We have defined\nthe normalized polarization vectors of the second string state to be [6, 7]\neP =\n\nk2\n1\n(E2 , k2 , 0) =\n,\nMop\nMop\n\n(2)\n\n1\n(k2 , E2 , 0),\nMop\n\n(3)\n\neL =\n\neT = (0, 0, 1)\n\n(4)\n\nin the CM frame contained in the plane of scattering.

Eq.(7) explicitly\nshows that there is only one independent high-energy scattering amplitudes at each fixed\nmass level.\nTo study the high energy process of Dp brane (2 \u2264 p \u2264 24) absorbs (emits) a massive\nclosed string state leading to two open strings on the Dp brane, we set up the kinematic for\nthe massive closed string state to be\nkc\n1\n(E, kc cos \u03c6, \u2212kc sin \u03c6, 0) =\n,\nM\nM\n1\n(kc , E cos \u03c6, \u2212E sin \u03c6, 0) ,\neL =\nM\n\neP =\n\neT = (0, sin \u03c6, cos \u03c6, 0) ,\nkc = (E, kc cos \u03c6, \u2212kc sin \u03c6, 0) .\n\n(8)\n\nFor simplicity, we chose the open string excitation to be two tachyons with momenta (see\nFig.1)\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\nE kop\nkop\nk1 = \u2212 , \u2212\ncos \u03b8, 0, \u2212\nsin \u03b8 ,\n2\n2\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\nE kop\nkop\nk2 = \u2212 , \u2212\ncos \u03b8, 0, +\nsin \u03b8 .\n2\n2\n2\n4\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\n\fOur final results, however, will remain the same for arbitrary two open string excitation at\nhigh energies.

To obtain the linear relations for the amplitudes\nat each fixed mass level, we rewrite Eq.(22) in the following form\nTT\n\nn\u22122q Lq ,T n\u22122q \u2032 Lq \u2032\n\nT T n ,T n\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\n2\n\u2212\nM cos2 \u03c6\n\n\u0013q+q\u2032\n\n(23)\n\n.\n\nOne first notes that Eq.(23) does not contradict with Eq.(7), which predict the ratios\n\u0001 \u2032\n1 q+q\n. This is because for the absorption process we are considering, there is only\n\u2212 2M\none kinematic variable and the usual Ward identity calculations do not apply. To compare\nEq.(23) with the \"ratios\" of the Domain-wall scattering [17]\nTT\n\nn\u22122q Lq ,T n\u22122q \u2032 Lq \u2032\n\nT T n ,T n\n\n|Domain =\n\nM\n\np\n\nE sin \u03c6\n|M12 \u2212 2M 2 \u2212 1| cos2 \u03c6\n\n!q+q\u2032\n\n,\n\n(24)\n\none sees that, in addition to the incident angle \u03c6, there is an energy dependent power\nfactor within the bracket of q + q \u2032 . Thus there is no linear relations for the Domain-wall\nscatterings. On the contrary, Eq.(23) gives the linear relations (of the kinematic variable\nE) and ratios among the high energy amplitudes corresponding to absorption of different\nclosed string states for each fixed mass level n by D-brane. Note that since the scattering\nangle \u03b8 is fixed by the incident angle \u03c6, \u03c6 is not a dynamical variable in the usual sense.\nAnother way to see this is through the relation of s and t in Eq.(14). We will call such\n7\n\n\fan angle a geometrical parameter in contrast to the usual dynamical variable. This kind\nof geometrical parameter shows up in closed string state scattered from generic Dp-brane\n(except D-instanton and D-particle) [16, 17]. This is because one has only two dynamical\nvariables for the scatterings, but needs more than two variables to set up the kinematic due\nto the relative geometry between the D-brane and the scattering plane at high energies. We\nemphasize that our result in Eq.(23) is consistent with the coexistence [17] of the linear\nrelations and exponential fall-off behavior of high energy string/D-brane amplitudes. That\nis, linear relations of the amplitudes are responsible for the softer, exponential fall-off highenergy string/D-brane scatterings than the power-law field theory scatterings.\nAcknowledgments: This work is supported in part by the National Science Council and\nNational Center for Theoretical Sciences, Taiwan, R.O.C.\n\n[1] G.
