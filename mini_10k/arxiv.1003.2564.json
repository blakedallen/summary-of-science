Since the low mass transfer means the accretion luminosity is\nlow, the individual stellar components can be viewed. Thus, these systems provide a unique\ncomparison to widely separated binaries for the study of how angular momentum losses and\nheating of the white dwarf affect the binary evolutionary scenario. While normal polars can\nreach mass accretion rates close to those of LARPS when they undergo long periods of low\nmass transfer, the main difference between LARPS and normal polars in low states appears\nto be the temperature of the white dwarf. Ultraviolet observations of normal polars have\nshown temperatures of 11-14,000K for their white dwarfs (Araujo-Betancor et al. 1995). In\ncontrast, the white dwarfs in the LARPS are less than 10,000K (Schmidt et al. 2005, 2007,\nhereafter S05, S07; Vogel et al. 2007, hereafter V07; Schwope et al. 2009, hereafter Sw09).\nThese low temperatures imply that compressional heating has not taken place and so these\nobjects have been suggested to be pre-Polars (S05) or PREPs (Sw09). Figure 5 of Sw09\nshows a nice plot of the temperatures of 9 PREPs compared to normal polars and accreting\nnon-magnetic white dwarfs that illustrates this difference. However, the terminology and\nbehavior is not always so cleanly separated. The system SDSS121209.31+013627.7 (Schmidt\net al. 2005b; Burleigh et al. 2006; hereafter B06) also has a low accretion rate and a low\nwhite dwarf temperature but has a brown dwarf secondary. Its evolutionary path has been\nsuggested to be either a polar in a low state or a PREP. In addition, the recent observation\nof enhanced activity levels in the LARP SDSSJ204827.9+005008.9 (Honeycutt et al. 2010)\nsuggest that it may not be a LARP/PREP or that even PREPs can have different levels of\nactivity.\nA secondary criteria for a LARP/PREP is the secondary underfilling its Roche lobe so\nthat Roche lobe overflow does not occur (S05; S07; Sw09). This is generally determined\nfrom the system having an spectral type too late to fill the lobe if it has a normal size for\nits type, as well as the absence of narrow components in the emission lines that can be\ntraced to a stream. However, the Honeycutt et al. (2010) study found evidence for a stream\nin SDSSJ204827.9+005008.9, although they could not determine if the system had entered\nan increased state of mass transfer at the time. While the low accretion rates and sizes\nof the secondaries imply no Roche lobe overflow, there could likely still be some accretion\nfrom the stellar wind of the secondary that is funnelled by the high field of the white dwarf\n(Li et al. 2004). The work of Webbink & Wickramasinghe (2005) using considerations of\nenergy, magnetic fields, separations and lifetimes supports a wind model for the LARPS. In\nthis study, we are not so concerned with the correct classification of our objects as LARPS,\nPREPs or normal polars in low states, or how the accretion might occur, but rather with\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nthe effects of low levels of accretion on the white dwarf.\nThese effects are visible through time-resolved UV observations. Accretion spots with\ntemperatures of 30,000-70,000K are easily visible on normal polars even during their sporadic low states of accretion with \u1e40 \u223c10\u221212 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (Araujo-Betancor et al. 2005; G\u00e4nsicke\net al. 2006) as large amplitude modulations of the UV light. However, it was somewhat\nsurprising to find that similar modulations were apparent for EF Eri (Szkody et al. 2006)\nwhich had been in a low state for seven years with \u1e40 of 10\u221213 M\u2299 yr\u22121 and the LARP MQ\nDra with an even lower \u1e40 of 10\u221214 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (Szkody et al. 2008). While the UV light curves\ncould be approximately matched with either hot spots or cyclotron components (Campbell\net al. 2008), each interpretation has its problems: the hot spots require different sizes and\ngeometries while the cyclotron origin requires much higher magnetic fields in the UV than\nare apparent in the optical. In order to further study the effects of this low level accretion, we used GALEX to obtain UV observations of two additional LARPS (WX LMi and\nSDSSJ103100.55+202832.2) and the system SDSSSJ121209.31+013627.7. For convenience,\nwe will refer to the SDSS objects as SDSS1031 and SDSS1212. The known parameters for\nthe three systems are listed in Table 1. While all three of these objects have comparable\nlow mass accretion rates, they present differences in magnetic field strength, white dwarf\ntemperature, spectral type of secondary and orbital period.\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nThe observational data include ground-based APO B, V, R, I light curves and FUV and\nNUV GALEX light curves. The GALEX observations took place on 2008 Feb 16, 23 and\nApril 5 (Table 2 provides a summary of the times). Images in both the near ultraviolet\n(NUV) detector (1750-2800\u00c5) and the far ultraviolet (FUV) detector (1350-1750\u00c5) (Martin\net al. 2005) were obtained for each source. The time-tag data were calibrated in 240s intervals (120s for the NUV of SDSSJ1212) and phased according to the spectroscopic ephemeris\ngiven in V07 for WX LMi, and to the photometric ephemeris given in B06 for SDSS1212.\nThe phasing for SDSS1212 is accurate to \u00b10.14 phase at the time of the GALEX obseravtaions. For SDSS1031, the ephemeris is not known with enough accuracy to phase to prior\ndata so arbitrary phasing was used with the period of S07. The phased datapoints were then\nbinned into 10, 15 and 20 phase bins to optimize the S/N vs time resolution. The magnitudes for each binning were then measured using a 9 pixel radius aperture with the IRAF2\n2\n\nIRAF (Image Reduction and Analysis Facility) is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories, which are operated by AURA, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National Science\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nroutine qphot, using an average sky over the entire phase interval. Flux conversions for\nthe modeling were done using the values given in the GALEX online documentation3 (FUV\nm0 =18.82=1.40\u00d710\u221215ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 \u00c5\u22121 and NUV m0 =20.08 =2.06\u00d710\u221216 ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121\n\u00c5\u22121 ).\nOptical photometry in 2008 April and May (Table 2) was obtained for WX LMi and\nSDSSJ1031 using the NMSU 1m telescope at Apache Point Observatory. Differential light\ncurves in BV RI filters were made from nearby comparison stars on the same CCD frames.\nFor WX LMi, one of the comparison stars used was the calibrated star A from Schwarz et\nal. (2001) so that the differential magnitudes could be transformed to actual BV RI values.\n\n3.\n\nThe Analysis Program\n\nAs in our previous spot models of EF Eri and MQ Dra, the BINSYN program suite\n(Linnell & Hubeny 1996) was used to calculate synthetic light curves that could fit the\nobservations. Recent papers (Linnell et al. 2007; 2008) illustrate details of its application\nto cataclysmic variables, and Hoard et al. (2005) describe its use in simulating hot spots on\nthe magnetic white dwarf YY Dra. While a hot spot may be multi-temperature and have a\ncomplicated shape as well as radiation influenced by the strong magnetic field, we attempted\nto minimize the free parameters by using a first approximation to the spot parameters with\na circular, isothermal hot spot (with a white dwarf spectral energy distribution). As our\nintent is to determine if a hot spot alone can account for the FUV and NUV light curves, we\nignore cyclotron effects. The harmonics will affect the optical light curves to various degrees\n(depending on where they appear in the various filters) and can add to or dominate the\nobserved amplitude of variation from the spot.\nIn general, if the objective of the analysis is only to fit the light variations (the absolute fluxes are unknown), the light curves are normalized to a light maxima of 1.0, and\nthen BINSYN can be used to calculate monochromatic light curves. In this mode, the program represents the stellar components as a sum of black body contributions from local\nphotospheric values of Teff determined by adopted values of bolometric albedos and gravity\ndarkening exponents. No synthetic spectra are needed.\nHowever, the WX LMi light curves required special considerations, since those light\ncurves are absolute flux measurements. Their simulation, via synthetic photometry from\nFoundation.\n3\n\nSee http://galexgi.gsfc.nasa.g ov/tools/index.html\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nsynthetic spectra, produced calculated absolute flux values outside the Earth's atmosphere,\nusing transmission profiles of the filters and the quantum efficiency of the CCD, and the\ndistance of the system. In previous papers the synthetic spectra input to BINSYN were\ncalculated using TLUSTY (Hubeny 1988) and SYNSPEC (Hubeny et al. 1994). However,\nthe Hubeny TLUSTY WD models do not extend to cooler than 8000K. Fortunately, cool\nWD models have been calculated by Bergeron et al. (1991; 1995). Dr. Bergeron kindly\nprovided a set of 40 WD synthetic spectra with log g=8.0 and Teff ranging from 17,000K\nto 1500K. Each synthetic spectrum includes Eddington flux values (erg sec\u22121 cm\u22122 hz\u22121 ) at\n1788 unequally-spaced wavelengths between 43\u00c5 and 95,000\u00c5. Synthetic spectra similar to\nthese have been used in the synthetic WD photometry of Holberg & Bergeron (2006). We\nproduced corresponding synthetic spectra in wavelength units (erg sec\u22121 cm\u22122 \u00c5\u22121 ).\nWe input WD synthetic spectra with Teff values of 6000K, 6500K, 7000K, 7500K, and\n8000K to BINSYN; the program then used an adopted WD Teff , within the above range, and\ninterpolated among the input spectra to produce a synthetic WD spectrum of the assigned\nTeff . As representation of the hot spots on the WD (the impact regions of the incoming\nmass from the secondary) requires additional synthetic WD spectra, we added input WD\nsynthetic spectra with Teff values of 10,000K, 11,000K, and 12,000K.\nSynthetic spectra to represent the secondary star present a separate problem. If the\nsecondary fills its Roche lobe, Teff and log g vary over the photosphere as determined by the\nvalues of gravity darkening and bolometric albedo (temperature variation due to irradiation\nby the WD is negligible). As BINSYN needs synthetic spectra for cool photospheres over a\nrange of Teff and log g, we downloaded a database of MARCS 4 synthetic spectra for this purpose. Each MARCS synthetic spectrum tabulates physical flux values (erg sec\u22121 cm\u22122 \u00c5\u22121 )\nfor 101,125 wavelengths unequally spaced between 900\u00c5 and 200,007\u00c5 and we then prepared\ncorresponding spectra in Eddington flux units. To permit accurate interpolation to the local\nphotospheric values of Teff and log g on the secondary star we provided BINSYN with 24\nMARCS spectra for Teff values of 2500K, 2700K, 2900K, 3100K, 3300K, and 3400K, and for\neach of these, log g values of 3.0, 4.0, 4.5, and 5.0. The single secondary component point\nnearest the L1 point has an associated photospheric segment whose flux contribution is negligible. We include an input black body spectrum of 1500K which, together with the other\ninput spectra for the secondary star, brackets this point. MARCS spectra span all other grid\nsegments covering the secondary star. The BINSYN output includes a synthetic spectrum\nfor the system, the WD, and the secondary star, all for an adopted orbital longitude and\norbital inclination, i.\n4\n\nhttp://marcs.astro.uu.se\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n4.\n\nWX LMi\n\nWX LMi was found in the Hamburg Quasar Survey by Reimers et al. (1999) who determined the orbital period, the spectral type of the secondary and the distance. From the\nspectrum and photometry, they concluded there were two accretion spots, with magnetic\nfields of 60 and 68 MG and the accretion rate was about 100 times less than normal polars.\nFurther long term photometry was obtained by Schwarz et al. (2001) and modeled to determine the colatitudes (90-130\u25e6) and azimuths (-70 to -80, and +90\u25e6) of the spots. These\nlocations placed the spots slightly below the equator of the white dwarf and further from\nthe line-of-centers between the stars than in normal high accretion rate polars. V07 used\nXMM-Newton to obtain X-ray data as well as some near UV photometry using the optical\nmonitor (OM) UV filters at 2910 and 3440\u00c5. They also used optical spectra to establish an\nupper limit to the temperature for the white dwarf of 8000K and to constrain the cyclotron\nmodel and accretion rate. They concluded that the low accretion rate was consistent with\naccretion resulting from wind loss from the secondary. Their model found small (40 km\nradius) accretion spots at similar locations to that of Schwarz et al. (2001) but the X-ray vs\nUV modulations and the hardness ratios were not consistent with heated spots. The X-ray\nemission was assumed to originate from both coronal activity on the secondary and from the\naccretion regions.\nThe GALEX data explore the regime between the X-ray and OM filters. The UV light\ncurves (with 15 phase bins) are shown in Figure 1 along with the optical data obtained about\n2 months later. The double-humped light curve variation that has been taken to be evidence\nof the accretion areas undergoes an interesting variation with wavelength. Figure 1 shows\nthe progression from a double-humped curve in the I filter to a very low level of variability\nin the optical B and then an increasing variation as the FUV is reached. The phasing here\nis spectroscopic (phase 0 is inferior conjunction of the secondary) so the primary pole is\nevident between phase 0.8 and 0.9, the secondary pole near phase 0.3 and both poles are\nself-eclipsed near phase 0.6. The FUV shows slightly higher flux for the secondary pole than\nthe primary, which corroborates what V07 regarded as a puzzle i.e. that the secondary spot\nseems hotter than the primary one. The dips at phase 0.3 in V and B are related to the\ncyclotron features at 5950\u00c5 and 5220\u00c5 which appear in these filters and change strength\nduring the orbit due to the changing viewing angle.\n\n4.1.\n\nModel Parameters\n\nV07 determined or adopted some of the parameters needed for a simulation of the\nWX LMi system including the orbital period, P ; Mwd = 0.6M\u2299 (adopted); Ms = 0.179M\u2299 ;\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nTeff,wd = 8000K; and Teff,s = 3300K, appropriate to an M4.5 spectral type. They also determined some of the spot parameters associated with the magnetic field, including \u03b2(1, 2) =\n145, 135, the spot colatitudes, and \u03c8(1, 2) = 60, \u221295, the spot azimuths. These parameters\nare listed in Table 3. The mass transfer rate (\u1e40 ) in WX LMi (\u223c 1.5\u00d710\u221213 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ; V07),\nis listed as a system parameter in Table 3 but is not needed in the analysis.\nMs = 0.179M\u2299 , listed in V07 (Table 2) for a secondary star of spectral type M4.5, differs\nslightly from the calibration of Knigge (2006; 2007), Ms = 0.200M\u2299 at the WX LMi orbital\nperiod, but we preserve the value 0.179M\u2299 for consistency with the other V07 parameters.\nWe have assigned error bars in Table 3 from the range of Ms values in Table 2 of V07. We\nadopt a secondary component model which fills its Roche lobe (\u03a9(s), Table 3). V07 describe\nWX LMi as a pre-polar candidate, appropriate to the very small \u1e40 , and underfilling its\nRoche lobe. It is convenient for our analysis to assume a secondary star which fills its Roche\nlobe; after obtaining a solution we tested the sensitivity of our assumption by performing a\nsimulation in which the secondary underfills its Roche lobe.\nThe adopted value of Mwd = 0.6M\u2299 has no assigned error bars. The radius of a zero\ntemperature homogeneous Hamada-Salpeter carbon 0.6M\u2299 WD is 0.0120R\u2299 (Panei et al.\n2000); we adopt this value with no change for the very small correction to a 8000K WD. The\nWD Roche potential, \u03a9wd , Table 3, produces the required Rwd . The Table 3 Teff,wd = 8000K\nwas determined by V07 but they state that the true value is less than 8000K; they were\nunable to pursue this topic because of their lack of lower temperature models. V07 show\nthat i is less than 72\u25e6 ; the presence of detectable ellipticity in the light curve suggests a fairly\nlarge i; we adopt i = 70\u25e6 . Figure 2 shows the final system synthetic spectrum at orbital\nphase 0.0. This synthetic spectrum can be compared with the observed spectrum (Figure 1\nof V07).\n\n4.2.\n\nB, V, R, I Synthetic Photometry light curves\n\nWe calculated and stored system synthetic spectra for 33 orbital longitudes for each\ntest simulation. Each synthetic spectrum extended from 800\u00c5 to 10,000\u00c5 and included\nEddington flux values at 1\u00c5 spacing, produced by interpolation within the input spectra\nto BINSYN and integrated, within BINSYN, over the photospheric segments visible to the\nobserver, and with an adopted limb darkening of 0.6. Our initial simulation neglected any\nhot spots on the WD as we expected possible hot spots only to make a negligible contribution\nto the B, V, R, I light curves. We subsequently verified this expectation.\nThe APO filter transmission curves and the quantum efficiency curve of the CCD used\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nfor the ground-based photometry were digitized by hand. The CCD quantum efficiency\ndrops to 0.0 at 10,000\u00c5 and this sets the upper wavelength limit for the simulation. We also\nproduced comparable transmission curves for the FUV and NUV filters using the GALEX\ncalibrations5 .\nProgram SYNPHOT, within the BINSYN package, produces the integrated physical\nflux for each filter resulting from a system synthetic spectrum incident on the APO filter set\nand CCD, given by the expression\nFs =\n\nR\n\nS(\u03bb)f (\u03bb)d\u03bb\nR\nS(\u03bb)d\u03bb\n\nwhere S(\u03bb) is the photometric system response function and f (\u03bb) is the synthetic spectrum incident flux.\nNumerical integration requires a value for the filter transmission and CCD response at\neach tabular wavelength of the system synthetic spectrum. We used the Numerical Recipes\n(Press et al. 1986) program Spline to fit each digitized filter transmission curve as well as\nthe CCD response curve, and the Numerical Recipes routine Splint to produce the required\ntransmission or response at the synthetic spectrum wavelengths.\nThe quantity to compare with an observed light curve is the integrated flux divided\nby D 2 , where D is the distance to the system in cgs units. We initially adopted the V07\ndetermination of 100 pc. The initial test showed rough agreement between simulation and\nobserved light curves with variable cyclotron contributions. The calculated light curves\nwere systematically too bright in B, R, and I, with a strong cyclotron contribution in V .\nWe varied the assumed distance to obtain an optimum overall fit by eye and determined a\nrevised distance of 107 pc. This value is in very close agreement with the V07 value of 104 pc\nin their Table 2 for the M4.5 spectral type adopted for the secondary star in this study.\nThe final light curves, compared with the observations, are shown in Figure 3 (note\nthe change in ordinate scale in Figure 3d). Cyclotron emission dominates the V band light\ncurve. This is in agreement with the V07 cyclotron model, their Figure 7. The same Figure 7\nindicates some cyclotron contribution to the B, R, and I light curves.\nFigure 3d shows that the synthetic light curve has slightly too much flux for the adopted\ndistance of 107 pc. As Figure 2 shows, the secondary component spectrum rises rapidly to\na peak near 10,000\u00c5. A small departure of the actual WX LMi secondary component from\nthe adopted model could explain this residual.\n5\n\nhttp://galexgi.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/instrument.html\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nThe inclination cannot be increased more than a few degrees without producing eclipses;\na reduction in the inclination decreases the light curve amplitude and increases the absolute flux level. We regard the adopted i = 70\u25e6 as optimum, considering the light curve\ncontributions by cyclotron emission.\n\n4.3.\n\nNUV and FUV Synthetic Photometry light curves\n\nFigure 7 of V07 makes no prediction concerning cyclotron emission in the FUV or\nNUV, and the contribution of the secondary component becomes negligible shortward of\nabout 3500\u00c5 so it does not contribute in the NUV or FUV.\nWe adopted circular models for the two hot spots and experimented with their Teff\nvalues and angular radii. Initial simulations suggested a WD Teff = 7800K. Initial choice\nof spot Teff values of 12,000K produced a FUV light curve amplitude that was much too\nlarge. Lower temperature spots require larger radii to preserve the light curve amplitude,\nparticularly in the NUV. Eventually we found an acceptable fit with spot radii of 32\u25e6 and\nTeff values of 10,000K. A final correction of the WD Teff to 7900K produced the best fit, by\neye (Figure 2 has a WD with Teff of 7900K). The FUV and NUV light curves are shown in\nFigure 4 and the final spot parameters are in Table 4.\nThe spots are large; a view of the WD at orbital phase 0.0 is in Figure 5. We suggest that\nthis result is not inconsistent with the small \u1e40 and impacting stream from the secondary\ncomponent wind rather than a stream emerging through the L1 point. While our spot sizes\nare much larger than those of V07, (their estimate of the accretion area was about 40 km in\nradius, whereas our 32\u25e6 spots are about 4700 km in radius), their estimate was based on the\nX-ray and beamed cyclotron regions. These areas are typically much smaller spots than the\nheated areas visible in the UV (G\u00e4nsicke et al. 2006). Time-resolved UV spectropolarimetry\nwill be required to obtain further knowledge of cyclotron effects in the UV. For the field\nstrength of 68 MG, the n=6-8 harmonics will be in the NUV band. This could account for\nsome of the deviations of the fit in this band.\nAs a check, we recalculated the B, V, R, and I light curves with and without the spots\nincluded in the model. There was a barely detectable spot contribution to those light curves,\nfar too small to require a revision of the model. Our model does not prove that hot spots\nare the cause of the NUV and FUV light variation, it only demonstrates that our adopted\nparameters can approximate the observed light variations. The deviations likely indicate\nthat the spots have more complicated geometries than our simple assumption of a circular\nshape.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n4.4.\n\nDoes the secondary component fill its Roche lobe?\n\nOur model assumes the secondary component fills its Roche lobe. As a test we changed\nthe value of \u03a9s (Table 3), so that the volume of the secondary was 95% of the initial model\nvalue which filled the Roche lobe. Recalculation of the B, V, R, I light curves showed that\nthe amplitudes are almost unaffected. A slight amplitude reduction of the I light curve is\nbarely detectable. Further reducing the volume to 90% produces the changes shown in Figure\n6. Thus, the secondary can underfill the Roche lobe by a small amount without reducing\nthe theoretical light curve amplitudes sufficiently to be in disagreement with the observed\nlight curve. However, if it underfills by a large factor, the light curve amplitude, especially\nin I, would be too small due to the reduced ellipticity of the secondary. If there is some\ncontribution of the n=2 harmonics in the I filter, the cyclotron would dilute the ellipsoidal\nvariation from the secondary, which would necessitate an even larger filling factor, although\nthe variation from the cyclotron would then add to the variablility as well.\n\n5.\n\nSDSS1031\n\nAs with the majority of the LARPS, SDSS1031 was discovered by searches through\nthe SDSS spectroscopic survey (S07). The variations in the polarimetry and photometry\ndetermined a short orbital period and the spacing of the cyclotron harmonics revealed the\nmagnetic field. The spectral fluxes between the cyclotron harmonics placed limits on the\nwhite dwarf temperature and the late spectral type of the secondary (Table 1 summarizes\nthese values). Its very short period makes it unusual among the LARPS (Figure 5 of Sw09),\nand may present problems for its evolution as a PREP. However, its low accretion rate,\ncool white dwarf and late type secondary which underfills its Roche lobe (S07) all match\nthe primary characteristics of LARPS. SDSS1031 shares many characteristics of the short\nperiod normal polar EF Eri which has mostly been is a low state since 1997 but does have\noccasional high states (Howell et al. 2006).\nThe UV through optical light curves of SDSS1031 are shown in Figure 7, where the\narbitrary phase in UV and optical is set so that maximum light occurs roughly at phase\n0. While SDSS1031 is the faintest of our three sources in the optical, the FUV magnitudes\nare comparable to WX LMi. The R filter shows the cyclotron variation found by S07 with\nsome evidence of a double-humped shape indicative of beaming in an optically thin high\ncyclotron harmonic. The V filter shows the least orbital variation while B has an increased\namplitude. The amplitude of the UV orbital modulation is much lower than in WX LMi\nand more asymmetical in shape, showing a gradual rise to maximum followed by a steeper\ndecline. If the variation is due to a hot spot, the similar amplitudes in FUV and NUV mean\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nthat the spots must be different sizes and simple circular isothermal spots will not provide a\ngood fit to the observations. To get a crude idea of what kind of spot would be needed, the\nBINSYN model was computed for the parameters shown in Table 4 and fit to the GALEX\ndata binned by 10 in phase (Figure 8). The best fit obtained was with a 13,000K spot at\n-65\u25e6 latitude. The spot radius was 10\u25e6 for the FUV and 23\u25e6 for NUV. However, as expected,\nthe shape of the variation is not fit well.\n\n5.1.\n\nSDSS1212\n\nLike SDSS1031, this object was found in searching through the SDSS spectra (Schmidt\net al. 2005b) because the Balmer lines showed Zeeman splitting from a magnetic white\ndwarf as well as weak H\u03b1 emission. Spectroscopy by these authors revealed a period near\n90 min but no secondary star was detected and an IR measurement at J implied a brown\ndwarf object of spectral type L5 or later. Further IR observations by Debes et al. (2006)\nrefined the orbital period and showed a variation in the K band that could be explained\nwith cyclotron emission from a small spot on the white dwarf. Farihi, Burleigh & Hoard\n(2008) modeled further IR data with an L8-T1 substellar dwarf and a white dwarf with a 7\nMG field. B06 obtained X-ray observations with Swift which detected the source but with\ntoo low of a count rate to ascertain variability. The flux was best fit with a thermal plasma\nwith kT=1.9 keV and a luminosity of 1029 erg s\u22121 . While this luminosity is comparable to\nthat detected in the LARP MQ Dra (Szkody et al. 2004), and the low state of the polar AR\nUMA (Szkody et al. 1999), it is far larger than the X-ray luminosities of L dwarfs (Stelzer\net al. 2006). The u, g, i photometry of B06 shows a single hump that increases in amplitude\nin the blue, with some slight indication of a second small peak half a phase later that was\npointed out by Koen & Maxted (2006). The origin of the second peak is not clear; Koen &\nMaxted (2006) suggested a reflection effect from the secondary (since the feature seemed to\nincrease at longer wavelengths), while B06 mention a possible second pole (but this is not\nevident in the IR photometry of Debes et al. (2006).\nB06 model the primary optical hump as a 14,000K hot spot on the white dwarf. However,\nas they point out, it is not clear what provides the accretion necessary to produce the Xrays and a hot spot. A brown dwarf that underfills its Roche lobe should not produce an\naccretion stream nor a wind outflow. Recent photometry by Howell et al. (2008) showed\nthat the strength of H\u03b1 is variable, indicating that the secondary has some activity. It may\nbe that the secondary stars in close binaries have higher activity levels than their single\ncounterparts due to their faster rotations in a binary system.\nOur GALEX data on SDSS1212 (Figure 9) shows a similar single-peaked modulation\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nwith increased amplitude in FUV over the NUV and a possible hint of a second small peak\nnear phase 0.5. The NUV magnitude is the brightest of the three objects. Trial models with\nBINSYN using the B06 parameters for the i, masses, and temperature of the white dwarf\nrevealed that the width of the hump is a clear function of the spot latitude, with greater\nwidth when the spot is in the same hemisphere as the visible pole. A good fit (Figure 10\nbottom) to the NUV light curve was obtained with a 14,000K spot (the same temperature\nfound by B06 from the optical light curves) with a radius of 9\u25e6 , but this spot produced a\nFUV amplitude that was too large. Thus, as in MQ Dra (Szkody et al. 2008), a single spot\nsize and temperature cannot fit both the NUV and FUV. If the spot temperature is kept at\n14,000K, a smaller spot of 7\u25e6 fits the FUV reasonably well (Figure 10 top). The observed\nlight curve shows some scatter and there is a hint that the light curve is asymmetric with a\nslower rise than decline. The spot sizes are 1% of the white dwarf surface in FUV and 1.7%\nin NUV, as compared to the 5% found by B06 from their optical modeling. These numbers\nfollow the trend of decreasing spot sizes with smaller wavelengths.\nIncreased time-resolution and S/N will be needed to further understand the reality and\nnature of the possible peak near phase 0.5. It is intriguing that this feature is evident from\nUV through the R band. These phases need to be targeted to determine if there is accretion\nrelated to a second pole.\n\n6.\n\nConclusions\n\nOur UV observations of three polars with extremely low accretion rates enforce the\nresults found from observations of EF Eri and MQ Dra i.e. that all the white dwarfs have\nareas of enhanced emission even with these low rates, indicating some accretion is still\noccuring. Despite a large range in magnetic field (7-70MG), the field is apparently strong\nenough in all three systems to funnel the accreting material to the magnetic pole(s) of the\nwhite dwarf. This appears to happen even in the case of SDSS1212, which likely has a\nbrown dwarf secondary. Thus, if the accretion is via a stellar wind from the secondary that\nis trapped by the field of the white dwarf, it is difficult to provide a wind of this type for\nSDSS1212. Time-resolved spectra that would enable Doppler tomography might provide a\nresolution of this issue. During high states of accretion, the stream flow is usually visible as\na narrow component in the Balmer emission lines which is mapped to the stream. In normal\npolars during their low states, high velocity components in the lines have been interpreted\nas structures similar to prominences close to the secondary star (Kafka et al. 2007, 2008).\nHowever, the Balmer emission in LARPS is weak to non-existent due to the low the accretion\nrates low so it would be difficult to construct the map.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nIf the increased emission evident at some phases is due to hotter temperature, simple\nspots of 10-000-14,000K covering a few percent of the white dwarf surface can approximate\nthe UV light curves, although the geometries of the spots require a more complex model\nshape than simply circular. Alternatively, if there is a large range in field strengths in\nthe white dwarfs, there could be contributions to the UV from higher cyclotron harmonics.\nImproved UV cyclotron models will be needed to test this possibility. Since these objects are\ntoo faint for GALEX spectra or high S/N time-resolved UV light curves that would merit\ndetailed models of the shape or of pursuing cyclotron radiation, further work will require\nUV spectra and polarimetry with larger telescopes.\nSupport for this research was provided by NASA GALEX grant NNX08AM07G.
