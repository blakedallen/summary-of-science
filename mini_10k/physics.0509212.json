The orange color of\nthe luminous ball is due to radiative exciton deexcitation and suggests that there may be a\nunique surrogate material for ball lightning.\n1. Introduction\nThe scientific interest in the excited state of matter has increased dramatically lately with\nrelevance to the enigmatic ball lightning: A recently proposed model regards the ball as a\nhighly excited state of an unspecified substance composed of Rydberg atoms excited by\nthe vast discharge of a linear lightning.[1] These atoms being highly polarizable, they\ngive rise to colossal dispersive interactions which keep the ball in a strongly cohesive\nthough highly flexible state within a few seconds after the excitation. Yet the model\ncould not explain the orange light emitted by the luminous ball as it deexcites. This light\napparently originates from an intrinsic luminescence hardly attrubutable to Rydberg\natoms.[2] One of the most popular theories nowadays seems to be the one attributing ball\nformation to the oxidation of silicon nanoparticles in the atmosphere as a linear lightning\nhits the ground.[3] The evolution of silicon nanoparticles is stimulated as carbon in the\nsoil reduces the silicon oxides to metallic silicon at the high lightning-strike temperatures.\nAs a matter of fact, traces of silicon have really been found at deexcitation sites as\nluminous plasma disks of apparently similar nature have been observed to form triggered\nby the detonation of explosives evolving silicon. Nevertheless, the situation seems more\ncomplicated since a ball has been observed to form on aircraft.[2] All this evidence seems\nto justify other attempts to add novel background to the unsolved ball-lightning problem.\nHerein we would like to show that in addition to Rydberg atoms there is at least one more\nkind of highly polarizable species produced through photoexcitation. Some time ago we\nstudied theoretically the colossal dispersive couplings arising from an enhanced\npolarizability of excitonic small-polaron species. The increased polarizability is obliged\nto the interplay of two factors: (i) an electric dipole due to inversion symmetry breaking\nand (ii) a polaron band narrowing (Holstein), both of them occurring in a lower-\n\n\fsymmetry vibronic-polaron manifold.[4] The resulting vibronic polarizability might\nsurpass by one to two orders of magnitude the normal electrostatic polarizability of a\ntwo-level system.[5] Consequently, Van-der-Waals dispersive interactions of unusual\nstrength might appear in a two-level system coupled to an asymmetric vibrational mode.\nIt will be seen that while Gilman's quest is for systems with an enhanced dipole moment\n(Rydberg atoms) in order to elevate the numerator of the polarizability equation, we look\nfor alternative systems (vibronic excitons) to reduce the denominator. The common result\nof both approaches is enhancing the polarizability of excited atomic clusters.\n2. Binding energy of vibronic exciton matter\nA vibronic exciton forms as the ultimate product of the relaxation of the band exciton\n(BE) to a self-trapped state (STE1) followed by a subsequent relaxation to another lowerlying self-trapped state (STE2) before producing a defect pair (DP). Normally the BESTE1 step of the transition process is presumed coupled to a symmetric vibration. The\nvibronic effects appear as the STE1-STE2 step couples to an asymmetric vibration. It\nshould be stressed that in the simplest case two nearly-degenerate different-parity\nelectronic states associated with STE2 are needed to mix vibronically by an asymmetric\nodd-parity vibrational mode. The overall process is exemplified in Figure 1 showing the\nsea of band excitons as well as the adiabatic potentials of subsequent symmetric and\nasymmetric self-trapped states. Similar qualitative diagrams have been considered\nelsewhere to illustrate the transfiguration of excitons to defect pairs in alkali halides and\nsilicon oxide.[6,7] What is essential is that the asymmetric-mode coupling lends an\nelectric dipole moment to the STE2 state, due to the breaking of inversion symmetry. The\nvibronic dipole might vanish on the average if the asymmetric species performed flip\nflops or rotations around the higher-symmetry site which would in effect smear the dipole\nmoment. With dipoles smeared or not, the breaking of inversion symmetry will give rise\nto dispersive interactions (a la London) within the STE2 ensemble. One is the vibronic\nextension of the Van-der-Waals coupling of atoms.\nIt should be stressed unequivocally at this point that the on-going conclusions are by no\nmeans dependent on whether the medium is crystalline or amorphous, a dense liquid, or\nis even in a soft aggregate state. What is needed is to have a manifold of similar\nmolecular clusters, each cluster breaking the inversion symmetry in static state even\nthough restoring it on the average in the dynamic rotatory state. An example familiar to\nchemists is the ammonia molecule with left-handed and right-handed configurations.[8]\n\n\fAdiabatic\nExciton\nPotentials\n\nVibronic potential, eV\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nCoupled mode coordinate, A\n\nFigure 1.\nAdiabatic vibronic potentials pertaining to polaronic excitons (schematic).

The radiative transitions from BS, STE1and STE2 follow\nvertical paths from the respective minima down to GS\n\nConcomitantly we consider a molecular cluster with two nearly-degenerate oppositeparity excitonic eigenstates \u03c81 and \u03c82 of eigenenergies \u03b51 and \u03b52, respectively. If now p12\n= < \u03c82| er |\u03c81 > is the electric dipole mixing these states, the electrostatic polarizability of\nthe two-level system will be\n\u03b1exc = (1/3) p122 / |\u03b52 \u2013 \u03b51 |\n\n(1)\n\nThe two-level electrostatic polarizability (1) brings about a VdW exciton pairing energy\nUVdWexc = 1\u20442 \u0395gap (\u03b1ex / \u03ba Rij3)2\n\n(2)\n\n\u03ba is the dielectric constant of the medium, Rij is the pair separation, \u0395gap = |\u03b52 \u2013 \u03b51 | is the\ninterlevel energy gap.\n\n\fWe subsequently assume that the two electronic states are mixed vibronically by an oddparity intermolecular vibration Q through the pseudo-Jahn-Teller effect. As a result of the\nvibronic mixing the original interlevel spacing Egap reduces to\n\u2206\u0395 = Egap exp(\u22122EJT/h\u03c9)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere EJT is the Jahn-Teller energy, \u03c9 \u2261 \u03c9ren = \u03c9bare\u221a[1 \u2013 (Egap/4EJT)2] is the renormalized\nfrequency of the coupled vibration, \u03c9bare being the bare vibrational frequency.

The vibronic polarizability \u03b1vib is temperature\ndependent (\u03b1vib0 is its low-temperature value)..

We also note that for small polaronic excitons 4EJT > Egap.\n\n\f3. Ball in crystalline matrix\nExperimentally, luminous balls have been observed as clouds of excitons formed in Ge\ncrystals under laser excitation.[10] The exciton concentration and binding energy have\nbeen estimated at 2\u00d71017 /cc and 2 meV, respectively. Unfortunately we cannot identify\nthe exciton state attained in these experiments, whether STE1 or STE2. Under similar\nconditions the STE2 state might have produced an excessive binding energy, as shown in\nTable I of Ref. [5].\nAs far as the STE2 aggregation processes in an alkali halide matrix are concerned, they\nmay prove essential before the subsequent exciton conversion to the DP state which splits\nthe electron and hole clouds to bring about the disintegration of the exciton. As\ndisintegration occurs on a massive scale, the anion sub-lattice turns into a lattice of F\ncenters coexisting with the remaining alkali sub-lattice. (The F center is a halogen\nvacancy having trapped an electron). At the same time, the halogen atoms find\nthemselves dissolved in the alkali ion \u2212 F center frame similar to what is happening in\nionic superconductors. Halogen interstitials may subsequently aggregate to form halogen\nmolecules and molecular ions. On splitting the electron & hole clouds, the colossal\npolarizability is transformed into F center and interstitial halogen polarizabilities.\n4. Atmospheric ball\nIn any event, the ball lightning seems to be a rare atmospheric occurrence. Nevertheless,\nwe shall single out some general properties of the real ball in the light of a fancy ball\nformed by a specific though fairly common material.\n4.1. The ammonia molecule story\nWe shall first consider in some detail the case of a molecule that may happen to play a\ncrucial role in our understanding of the ball lightning. As stated above, ammonia is a\ntextbook example of broken-inversion-symmetry molecular cluster.[8,11] Ammonia may\nbe suggested to form photochemically in the atmosphere during huge linear discharges,\npossibly by way of 6H2O + 2N2 \u2192 4NH3 + 3O2. Ammonia is the case of a D3h symmetry\nNH3 cluster in the unstable planar configuration which is stabilized by the nitrogen\nmoving out of the H3 plane to form a triangular pyramid with N residing at its vertex.\nMoving N out of the H3 plane breaks the inversion symmetry of the planar cluster. The\nasymmetric NH3 cluster possesses 2 distinct equilibrium modifications, left-handed and\nright-handed, with corresponding inversion dipoles equal in magnitude but directed\noppositely to each other. At ambient temperature the system makes flip-flop jumps from\none configuration to the other one as nitrogen passes easily through the hydrogen plane\nreverting the molecule. Because of these jumps the resultant electric dipole smears.\nNevertheless, a system of ammonia molecules is polarizable electrically which gives rise\nto the Van-der-Waals intermolecular coupling. As we have seen in Section 2, the vibronic\nmixing may build up a great deal of polarizability resulting in a colossal VdW coupling.\nLiterature calculations of adiabatic potentials of NH3 molecules show that the instability\nof the inversion-symmetric planar configuration in 1A1' ground-state is lifted through the\n\n\fmixing of 1A1' with the second higher-lying 1A2\" excited state by an A2\" mode coordinate\nof the D3h point group.[8] From the data tabulated therein we get EJT = 0.16 eV at Egap = 5\neV (first excited state) and EJT = 5.16 eV at Egap = 14 eV (second excited state) relative to\nmixing with the ground state. We see that the small-polaron criterion 4EJT/Egap >> 1 is\nonly met for the ground-state to second-excited state mixing which lifts the planar\ninstability in the ground state. The stiffness in any state is K = 0.427\u00d7105 dyn/cm = 2.67\neV/\u00c52. In so far as the A1' and A2\" modes are in-phase hydrogen vibrations along with an\ncounter-phase nitrogen vibration,[8] the common oscillator mass is M = [3/MH + 1/MN]-1\n\u223c 1/3 and we arrive at a bare mode frequency of \u03c9 = 2.78\u00d71014 s-1 = 0.18 eV. Using these\ndata we calculate a Holstein reduction factor of exp(-2EJT/h\u03c9) = 1.26\u00d710-25 and \u2206\u0395 =\n1.76\u00d710-24 eV. Setting p12 = 1 e\u00c5 we get a huge vibronic polarizability of \u03b1 = 6.52\u00d710-12\ncm3 = 6.52\u00d71012 \u00c53. Using that estimate we calculate UVdW = 76 meV at Rij = 2 \u00c5 for \u03ba =\n1.5. This is more than 30 times higher than the exciton binding energy in Ge! The\nammonia adiabatic potentials along the A2\" mode coordinate are shown in Figure 2, as\ncalculated from the literature data.[8] These potentials are computed using the equations:\nEAD(Q) = 1\u20442{KQ2 \u00b1 \u221a(4G2Q2 + Egap2)}\n\n(11)\n\nwith parameters as follows: G = 5.24 eV/\u00c5 (electron-mode coupling constant), K = 2.67\neV/\u00c52 (stiffness), Egap = 14 eV (gap energy). Q is the coupled mode coordinate.\n\nAmmonia\nAdiabatic\nPotential\n\n40\n35\n30\n\nVibronic potential, eV\n\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n-5\n-10\n-15\n-20\n-25\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nA2\" mode coordinate, A\n\nFigure 2.\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n\fAmmonia adiabatic potentials along the A2\" mode coordinate (D3h point group) rendering\nunstable the planar configuration of the NH3 molecule. Atomic displacements in the\numbrella mode: H\u2193-H\u2193-H\u2193-N\u2191. The instability is lifted as the N atom is pushed firmly\nout of the H3 plane to reside at the vertex of a regular NH3 pyramid. The two pyramidal\nconfigurations, left-handed and right-handed, pertain to the two lateral minima of the\nground-state potential. The position of a lower-lying excited state in which the N atom is\nin a Rydberg state is intermediate.\nSimilar adiabatic potentials have been obtained using eq.(10) for NH3+ (G = 3.27 eV/\u00c5, K\n= 2,67 eV/\u00c52, Egap = 12 eV) and CH4 (G = 4.36 eV/\u00c5, K = 2,67 eV/\u00c52, Egap = 11 eV). [8]\nIn all these cases the dipolar double-well instability has proved inherent to the ground\nelectronic state, while the excited electronic state has always been single-well.\nHowever, for a vibronic exciton phase to form at all, the stringent requirement is that the\nsurrogate molecular cluster should possess a double-well dependence on a mixing mode\ncoordinate in an excited electronic state. Unfortunately, this is not the case of the\nammonia molecule which has been seen to have a double-well ground electronic state\nalong the A1' mode coordinate, as well as two single-well A2\" excited states.[8,11,12] In\nother words, the higher symmetry planar NH3 configuration is unstable in ground state\nand stable in the excited states. Consequently, ammonia may build up a vibronic phase\nonly in ground state, while its excitonic states will rather be STE1. Accordingly,\nammonia may only build up dark cohesive clouds, while the ball-lightning clouds are\nexpected to be luminous. Alternatively, it is conceivable considering the ammonia cluster\nas a precursor to the luminous ball. The indirect ball formation scenario is that while a #1\nlinear lightning builds up a supersaturated ammonia gas phase which condenses to a dark\nball, a #2 lightning excites that ball to turn it luminous. This may be the case, provided\nthe two discharges are well spaced in time to let the dark ball condense. Once turned\nluminous by the second discharge, the ball will ultimately disintegrate into a gas of\nammonia molecules in a matter of a few seconds.\n4.2. The surrogate molecule\nFor the direct formation of a luminous ball, we shall consider a surrogate molecular\ncluster of presently unspecified nature which can be photoexcited to build up a vibronic\nexciton phase and subsequently condense to an exciton cloud better known as ball\nlightning. This implies that two excited states of the surrogate cluster mix vibronically to\nlift an instability inherent to one of them by producing a double-well adiabatic potential\ntherein. Examples of excited state instabilities are provided by defect formation processes\nvia self-trapped excitons, 2p-2s excited states mixing at F centers in alkali halides, etc\nIt is tempting to propose the following sequence of fundamental processes leding to a\nball: A huge linear-lightning discharge produces an amount of surrogate molecules in the\nexcited electronic state. The main part of the excited molecules produce vibronic excitons\nwhich bind by way of the collosal VdW coupling leading to an excited surrogate gas\nphase. If the gas state is supersaturated, there will be excited surrogate condensation into\n\n\fclouds, possibly one cloud. Condensation will cease once the supersaturation has been\ndepleted resulting in one single stable ball. Ultimately the surrogate vibronic excitons\nwill relax radiatively to the ground electronic state emitting light in the orange region of\nthe visible spectrum giving the luminous appearance of the ball formed. The observations\nsuggest that there are both fluorescence and phosphorescence coming out of the ball\nwhich is understandable if a more complex tunneling transfer is involved. The condensed\nball cloud will undoubtedly spill once the luminous emission has ceased, as the molecules\nwill have relaxed to their ground states and the colossal binding will have vanished.\nThe nature of the surrogate molecules is not known, at least for the time being. Besides\nNH3, two likely species to be produced during a linear discharge are NH3+ and CH4. As\ntold above, adiabatic energy calculations carried out for both of them show a dynamically\nunstable ground state and a stable excited state in the centrosymmetric configuration.[8]\nBoth instabilities are lifted by the central atom moving out of the centrosymmetric point.\nTherefore these species are not fit for producing vibronic excitons, as well as NH3. It will\nbe interesting to list other reagents and photochemical products of a linear discharge for\nstudying their adiabatic potentials. We can guess of H2O, CO2, O3 and even of SiO2 in so\nfar as linear discharges often hit the silica rich ground.\nThe low shear displacement modulus leading to the high flexibility of the ball material\nhas been discussed by Gilman.[1] We assume that his conclusions apply to any VdW\nbinding whatever its specific nature.\n5. Conclusion\nIn conclusion, we believe Gilman's suggestion for a highly cohesive ball state based on\ncolossal Van der Waals attraction is basically correct. Herein we explored the alternative\nof a colossal Van der Waals coupling arising from Holstein's gap narrowing in small\npolaronic exciton systems. We considered a few illuminating cases and proposed a\ngeneral scenario for the processes leading to ball formation. However, the basic surrogate\nsubstance for a ball matter remains unidentified. Nevertheless, we guess the present study\nmay set the frames of future investigations into the problem. It will be essential to find if\nthe ball formation proceeds directly to a luminous ball or indirectly via a dark precursor.\nIn this respect, we consider the vibronic coupling at the N atom excited Rydberg state,\nwhose position is intermediate in Figure 2. Calculations have shown this state not to mix\nwith the ground state of the ammonia molecule.[8] Instead, the next higher lying excited\nstate has been found to mix strongly with the ground state. We agree but the Rydberg\nstate not contributing to the chemical bond at the NH3 molecule, it should, nevertheless,\nmix with the next higher-lying bonding state along the umbrella mode coordinate, for,\notherwise, the system should disintegrate once in a Rydberg state. Strong mixing with the\nbonding state will produce a double-well character for the adiabatic potential of the\nRydberg state. Inasmuch as this state is only 9 eV below the next excited bonding state, it\nwill take a coupling constant G \u2265 0.87 eV/\u00c5 to produce the strong mixing. We therefore\nappeal for improved numerical calculations of the NH3 potentials.\n\n\fReferences\n[1] J.J. Gilman, Appl. Phys. Lett. 83 (11) 2283-2284 (2003):\n\"Cohesion in ball lightning.\"\n[2] B.
