If the optical depth (\u03c4 = NH \u03c3T ) for Compton scattering does\nnot exceed values of the order of \"a few\", X\u2013ray photons with energies higher than\n10\u201315 keV are able to penetrate the obscuring material and reach the observer.\nFor higher values of \u03c4 , the entire X\u2013ray spectrum is depressed by Compton down\nscattering and the X\u2013ray photons are effectively trapped by the obscuring material\nirrespective of their energy. The former class of sources (mildly CT) can be efficiently detected by X\u2013ray instruments sensitive above 10 keV, while for the latter\n(heavily CT) their nature may be inferred through indirect arguments, such as the\npresence of a strong iron K\u03b1 line over a flat reflected continuum. The search for\nand the characterization of the physical properties of CT AGN is relevant to understand the evolution of accreting Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs). In particular,\nmildly CT AGN are the most promising candidates to explain the residual (i.e. not\nyet resolved) spectrum of the X\u2013ray background around its 30 keV peak (Comastri\n2004a; Worsley et al. 2005) but only a handful of them are known beyond the local\nUniverse (see Comastri 2004b for a review). If this were the case, we may be missing\na not negligible fraction of the accretion power in the Universe and of the baryonic\nmatter locked in SMBH (Marconi et al. 2004). An unbiased census of extremely\nobscured AGN would require to survey the hard X\u2013ray sky above 10 keV with good\nsensitivity. Such an argument is one of the key scientific drivers of the SimbolX\nmission (Ferrando et al. 2006), which will be hopefully launched in the next decade.\ntypeset using P T P TEX.cls hVer.0.9i\n\n\f2\n\nA. Comastri et al.\n\nFor the time being one has to rely on the observations obtained by the high energy\ndetectors on board BeppoSAX, INTEGRAL, Swift and, more recently, Suzaku.\nThough limited to bright and thus low redshift sources, they have proven to be quite\nsuccessful in finding heavily obscured CT AGN. As a first step forward towards a\ncensus of CT AGN we have conceived a program with Suzaku to observe hard X\u2013\nray selected bright AGN from the INTEGRAL/IBIS (Beckmann et al. 2006) and\nSwift/BAT (Markwardt et al. 2005) catalogues. The goal of this program is to\ndiscover \"new\" CT AGN which are likely to be present among the already detected\nsources, but not recognized as such due to the poor counting statistics and/or the\nlack of information at lower energies. In order to select the most suitable candidates,\nwe have considered the sources in the above mentioned AGN catalogues with a bright\nhard X\u2013ray flux and tentative evidence of intrinsic absorption from observations at\nlower energies. For a few of them the column densities are estimated to be close to\nthe CT threshold. Suzaku observations were obtained for NGC 5728 and NGC 4992.\n\u00a72.\n\nThe Suzaku observations\n\n10\u22123\n\n2\u00d710\u22123\n\nThe reprocessed (v1.2) data were reduced using standard calibration products\navailable in November 2006. Source spectra are obtained from the Front Illuminated\nXIS chips with an extraction radius of \u223c3\u2032 , while background spectra are extracted\nfrom nearby regions with a larger radius to guarantee good statistics. The effective\nexposure time for both sources is of the order of 30 ksec. The pin hard X\u2013ray\nsource spectra were obtained taking into account both the instrumental background\nappropriate for each observation and the cosmic X\u2013ray background. The pin/XIS\nintercalibration constant was fixed at 1.16. In the following, we report the basic\nresults obtained from the analysis of the X\u2013ray spectra of the two sources and refer\nto Comastri et al.

The source\nis clearly detected by the pin detector up to about 50 keV. The primary X\u2013ray\ncontinuum is absorbed by Compton thick gas (NH \u2243 2.1 \u00b1 0.2 \u00d7 1024 cm\u22122 ). The\npower law slope has been fixed at \u0393 = 1.9 due to the narrow energy range (20\u201340\nkeV) over which the continuum is free from obscuration effects. At lower energy, the\ncontinuum can be represented by a two component model: a flat one responsible for\nmost of the X\u2013ray flux in the \u223c 2\u20136 keV energy range and a steep one taking over\nbelow 2 keV. The former may be ascribed to reflection of cold material presumably\nfrom the inner wall of the torus, while the latter has a power law shape and can\nbe identified as primary emission scattered by off\u2013nuclear gas into the line of sight,\nor unresolved soft X\u2013ray emission lines, as commonly observed in Seyfert 2 galaxies\n(Guainazzi & Bianchi 2007). The scattered/reflected flux accounts for 1\u20132 % of the\ntotal unabsorbed flux (\u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u221211 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 ) in the 2\u201310 keV band. The 2\u201350\nkeV unabsorbed luminosity is 2.3 \u00d7 1043 erg \u22121 , typical of a bright Seyfert galaxy.\nIt is interesting to note that the hard (> 10 keV) X\u2013ray flux as measured by the\npin detector is consistent within 20% with the Swift/BAT measurement in the\noverlapping energy range. A zoom of the \u223c 5\u20138 keV unfolded spectrum is shown in\nFig. 1 (right panel). The iron line complex is best fitted with two gaussian lines: a\nstrong (EW \u2243 1.0\u00b10.3 keV) iron K\u03b1 line at \u223c 6.4 keV and a K\u03b2 (EW \u223c 130\u00b170 eV)\nat \u223c 7 keV. The relative ratio is consistent with that expected from cold neutral gas.\nThe addition of a Compton shoulder parameterized by a Gaussian profile centered at\n6.3 keV and \u03c3 = 40 eV (Matt 2002), though not statistically required, accounts for\nsome 10% of the K\u03b1 line flux, in reasonably good agreement with the value expected\nfor reflection from Compton thick matter.\n2.2. NGC 4992\nThe Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 4992 is detected by Suzaku up to about 30 keV with\na flux consistent (within 10%) with that reported by INTEGRAL. The continuum\n(a power law with \u0393 =1.9) is heavily obscured (NH \u223c 4.5 \u00b1 0.5 \u00d7 1023 cm\u22122 ) but\n\n\f4\n\nA. Comastri et al.\n\nnot Compton thick. The high energy spectrum is best fitted by adding a strong,\nabsorbed, disk reflection component to the primary power law. The quality of the\ndata is not such to tightly constrain the intensity of the reflection component. The\n90% lower limit (R > 5) indicate a reflection dominated spectrum which is similar to\nthat reported by Miniutti et al. (2007) from the analysis of the XMM-Newton data\nof IRAS 13197-1627. The source is extremely weak below 3\u20134 keV. The addition\nof an unabsorbed reflection spectrum only marginally improves the fit (Fig. 2, left\npanel). A zoom of the residuals in the 4.5\u20137.5 keV range, wrt the best fit continuum\nmodel, is shown in Fig. 2 (right panel). The shape of the residuals suggests the\npresence of a broad line. Indeed the best fit to the line emission is obtained with\na diskline model. Leaving only the line flux and the disk inclination angle as free\nparameters, the line equivalent width is \u223c 750 \u00b1 200 eV and the inclination angle is\n< 40 degrees (at 90% confidence). The best fit EW is consistent with a reflection\ndominated nature of the broad band spectrum. The absorption corrected 2\u201350 keV\nluminosity is \u223c 6 \u00d7 1043 erg s\u22121 .\n2.3. Epilogue\nRelatively shallow Suzaku observations of two hard X\u2013ray selected (with INTEGRAL/IBIS and Swift/BAT) nearby Seyfert 2 galaxies have revelead a wealth of\nspectral complexity in their X\u2013ray spectra. The good sensitivity over a broad X\u2013\nray energy range makes Suzaku very efficient to study the most obscured sources in\nthe nearby Universe and will eventually allow us to establish the AGN absorption\ndistribution at high column densities.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank G.
