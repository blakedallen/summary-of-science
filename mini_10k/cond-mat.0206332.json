Moreover, the mobility of holes\nin this \"metallic\" antiferromagnetic state is found to be virtually the same as that\nin optimally-doped crystals, which strongly suggests that the stripes govern the\ncharge transport in a surprisingly wide doping range up to optimum doping.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn high-Tc cuprates such as La2\u2212x Srx CuO4 (LSCO), the antiferromagnetic\n(AF) state gives way to high-Tc superconductivity when a sufficient number of holes are doped into the CuO2 planes. The AF state of cuprates\nis therefore a natural starting point to establish the picture of high-Tc superconductors, but nevertheless their transport properties have not drawn\nsufficient attention. It has been generally believed that the hole motion\ninevitably frustrates the antiferromagnetic bonds and thus the doped holes\nmust be strongly localized until the long-range AF order is destroyed. Indeed, the variable-range-hopping conductivity has been mostly observed\nin the AF state of cuprates,1,2 which is naturally expected for the localized holes. As a result, researchers have been discouraged by the apparent\nsimplicity of this so-called \"antiferromagnetic insulator\" regime.\nHowever, recent measurements in clean, lightly-doped YBa2 Cu3 Oy\n(YBCO) crystals have demonstrated3,4 that the charge transport in the\nAF state is full of surprise: the temperature dependence of the in-plane\nresistivity \u03c1ab remains to be metallic (\u03c1ab decreases with decreasing temperature) across the N\u00e9el temperature TN , anomalous features in the magnetoresistance imply that holes form stripes instead of being homogeneously\n1\n\n\f2\n\nLa Sr CuO\n2-x\n\nx\n\n4\n\n2\n\nx=0.01\n10\n\nT\n\nN\n\nH=5 kOe\nH // c\n\n(b)\n\n-3\n\nx=0.03\n\nM (10 emu/g)\n\n\u03c1\n\nab\n\n(m\u03a9cm)\n\n100\n\n1\n\nx=0.17\n0.1\n\n1\n\nx=0.01\n\n(a)\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\nT (K)\n0\n\n50\n\n100 150 200 250 300\n\nT (K)\nFigure 1.

Motivated by these results3,4\non YBCO that we obtained in 1999, we have revisited the charge transport\nin clean single crystals of LSCO, where studying the lightly-doped regime\nis much more straightforward than in other cuprates; the hole doping p\nin the CuO2 planes is equal to x, the Sr content, and TN can be readily\ndetermined by susceptibility measurements.5\nHere we show that, contrary to the common belief, the doped holes\nin clean single-crystalline cuprates are surprisingly mobile in a wide range\nof temperatures even in the long-range-ordered AF phase. This is possible when the electron system self-organizes into hole-rich stripes and holepoor AF regions to facilitate the motion of charges. We further show that\nthe hole mobility at moderate temperatures remains virtually unchanged\nthroughout a wide doping range from the lightly-doped AF regime (hole\ndoping of 1%) to the optimally-doped regime (hole doping of 17%) where the\nsuperconducting transition temperature is maximal. This strongly suggests\nthat the hole motion is governed by the stripes all the way up to optimum\ndoping, and thus the high-temperature superconductivity appears to be a\nproperty associated with the stripes.\n\n\f3\n\n300\n\nT (K)\n\nMetal-like Regime\n200\n\n100\n\nSC\n\nAF\n0\n0.00\n\nSG\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.16\n\n0.18\n\nHole doping\nFigure 2.

Experimental\nThe clean single crystals of LSCO are grown by the traveling-solvent\nfloating-zone (TSFZ) technique6 and are carefully annealed to remove excess oxygen, which ensures that the hole doping is exactly equal to x. The\nin-plane resistivity \u03c1ab and the Hall coefficient RH are measured using a\nstandard ac six-probe method. The Hall effect measurements are done by\nsweeping the magnetic field to \u00b114 T at fixed temperatures stabilized within\n\u223c1 mK accuracy.3 The Hall coefficients are always determined by fitting\nthe H-linear Hall voltage in the range of \u00b114 T, which is obtained after\nsubtracting the magnetic-field-symmetrical magnetoresistance component\ncaused by small misalignment of the voltage contacts.\n3. Results\nFigure 1(a) shows the temperature dependences of \u03c1ab for LSCO crystals\nwhich represent three doping regimes1,7 on the phase diagram (Fig. 2):\nantiferromagnetic [the sample with x = 0.01 has TN \u2243 240 K according\nto the magnetization data shown in Fig. 1(b)], spin glass (x = 0.03), and\noptimally-doped superconductor (x = 0.17). (More complete data sets can\nbe found in our recent papers.6,8 ) One may notice that, while the magnitude of the resistivity significantly increases with decreasing doping, the\n\n\f4\n\nLa Sr CuO\n2-x\n\n2\n\n[=\u03bc ] (Vs/cm )\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\nx\n\n4\n\nx=0.01\n\n-1\n\nT\n\nN\n\nx=0.03\n\nh\n\nn e\u03c1\n\nab\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\nx=0.17\n0\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nT (K)\nFigure 3. Temperature dependences of the normalized resistivity nh e\u03c1ab of LSCO crystals, where nh = 2x/V is the nominal hole density. Note that nh e\u03c1ab is essentially an\ninverse mobility \u03bc\u22121 of doped holes.\n\ntemperature dependence at T > 150 K does not change much; in particular, in the sample with x = 0.01, \u03c1ab keeps its metallic behavior well below\nTN . This observation in the lightly-doped LSCO crystal clearly invalidates\nthe long-standing notion that the metal-like behavior of \u03c1ab (T ) in cuprates\nmay appear only as soon as the long-range AF order is destroyed.\nTo examine whether the hole mobility actually depends on the magnetic\nstate as crucially as has been expected, in Fig. 3 we normalize \u03c1ab by the\nnominal hole concentration nh , which is given by 2x/V [unit cell V (\u2243\n3.8 \u00d7 3.8 \u00d7 13.2 \u00c53 ) contains two CuO2 planes]. The product nh e\u03c1ab would\nmean just inverse hole mobility \u03bc\u22121 if we assume the number of mobile holes\nto be always given by x. Apparently, the slope and magnitude of nh e\u03c1ab\nat moderate temperatures are very similar, suggesting that the transport is\ngoverned by essentially the same mechanism for all three doping regimes; in\nparticular, the magnitudes of the hole mobility at room temperature differ\nby only a factor of three between x = 0.01 and 0.17, demonstrating that\nthe hole mobility remains virtually unchanged in a surprisingly wide range\nof doping. We note that the magnitude of the hole mobility in LSCO (order\nof 10 cm2 /Vs at 300 K) is almost the same as that in YBCO;8 this suggests\nthat the hole mobility in the CuO2 planes is essentially universal among the\ncuprates. Interestingly, typical metals (such as iron or lead) show similar\nvalues of carrier mobility, (ne\u03c1)\u22121 , at room temperature.8\n\n\f5\n\nx=0.03\n0.03 hole/Cu\n\n3\n\nLa Sr CuO\n2-x\n\n2\n\nH\n\n-1\n\n(eR ) (10\n\n20\n\n-3\n\ncm )\n\n4\n\nx\n\n4\n\nx=0.01\n1\n\n0.01 hole/Cu\n\nT\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\nN\n\n250\n\n300\n\nT (K)\nFigure 4. The apparent hole density of carriers n = (eRH )\u22121 for the two lightly-doped\nLSCO crystals; solid lines indicate the nominal value nh .\n\nThe region that is characterized by the metallic transport behavior\n(d\u03c1ab /dT > 0) is depicted in the phase diagram (Fig. 2); evidently, it\nextends widely in the phase diagram and essentially ignores the changes in\nthe magnetic properties. It is worth noting that the normal-state resistivity\nin superconducting LSCO was studied9,10 by suppressing superconductivity with 60-T magnetic fields and an increase in \u03c1ab at low temperature\nwas observed up to optimum doping; thus, the high mobility of holes at\nmoderate temperature and localization at low temperature appear to be\nessentially unchanged in the normal state in the whole underdoped region,\nall the way from x = 0.01 to 0.15.\nAnother evidence for unexpected metallic charge transport in the AF\ncuprates can been found in the Hall coefficient RH . The apparent hole\ndensity n = (eRH )\u22121 obtained for the LSCO samples with x = 0.01 and\n0.03 (Fig. 4) is essentially temperature independent in the temperature\nrange where the metallic behavior of \u03c1ab (T ) is observed, which is exactly\nthe behavior that ordinary metals show. Moreover, n agrees well with the\nnominal hole concentration nh = 2x/V at x = 0.01, which means that\nall the doped holes are moving and contributing to the Hall effect even\nin the long-range-ordered AF state down to not-so-low temperatures until\ndisorder causes the holes to localize. For higher doping, the ratio n/nh\nexceeds unity and reaches a value of \u223c3 at optimum doping.\n\n\f6\n\n4. Discussions\n4.1. Unusual Metallic Transport\nIt is useful to note that the absolute value of \u03c1ab for x = 0.01 is as large\nas 19 m\u03a9cm at 300 K. If we calculate the kF l value (kF is the Fermi wave\nnumber and l is the mean free path) using the formula hc0 /\u03c1ab e2 (c0 is the\ninterlayer distance), which implicitly assumes a uniform 2D electron system\nand the Luttinger's theorem, the kF l value for x = 0.01 would be only 0.1;\nthis strongly violates the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit for metallic transport, and\nthus the conventional wisdom says that the band-like metallic transport\nis impossible for x = 0.01. In other words, the metallic transport in the\nslightly hole-doped LSCO is a strong manifestation of the \"bad metal\"\nbehavior.11\nVery recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements of lightly-doped LSCO crystals have found12 that \"Fermi arcs\"\ndevelop at the zone-diagonal directions in the k-space, on which metallic quasiparticles are observed. These Fermi arcs are different from the\nsmall Hall pockets and apparently violate the Luttinger's theorem, because\nthe Fermi surface is partially destroyed and thus the enclosed area is not\nwell-defined. Therefore, at least phenomenologically, such violation of the\nLuttinger's theorem by the Fermi arcs allows the system to have a small\neffective carrier number and a \"large\" kF value at the same time, which enables the metallic transport to be realized in the lightly hole-doped regime.\n(Thus, the kF l value estimated under the assumption of a uniform 2D system is obviously erroneous.)\n4.2. Difficulty of Metallic Transport in the\nAntiferromagnetic State\nHow can such an unusual metallic transport and the relatively high mobility of doped holes be possible in the long-range-ordered AF phase? It has\nbeen known for a long time that a single hole doped into a two-dimensional\nsquare antiferromagnet should have a very low mobility because of the\nlarge magnetic energy cost of the spin bonds broken by the hole motion,\nalthough quantum effects allow the hole to propagate.13,14 Despite this common knowledge, our resistivity and the Hall coefficient data demonstrate\nthat the doped holes in the AF state can have the mobility nearly as high\nas that at optimum doping, which means that the holes manage to move\nwithout paying the penalty for frustrating AF bonds. This striking contrariety is not restricted to the simple one-band model implicitly hypothesized\nin the above argument. Whatever the transport mechanism is, the doped\n\n\f7\n\nholes should have an extremely strong coupling to the AF background; otherwise such a small amount of holes as 2% would not be able to destroy\nthe AF state.1 At the same time, this strong coupling tends to localize the\nholes arbitrarily distributed in the AF background, since the spin distortion\ncreated by a hole in the rigid N\u00e9el state destroys the translational symmetry. Therefore, the unusually metallic charge transport in the AF phase\nrequires a novel mechanism to be realized in the lightly-doped cuprates.\n4.3. Role of Stripes\nTo the best of our knowledge, the only possibility for the metal-like conductivity to survive under the strong coupling of holes with the magnetic order\nis when the holes and spins form a superstructure which restores the translational symmetry. A well-known example is the striped structure,14,15,16\nwhere the energy cost for the distortion of the spin lattice is paid upon the\nstripe formation and then the holes can propagate along the stripes without\nlosing their kinetic energy. In fact, the striped structure has been already\nestablished17 for La2\u2212x\u2212y Ndy Srx CuO4 , and there is now growing evidence\nfor the existence of stripes in other hole-doped cuprates,3,18,19,20,21 the case\nbeing particularly strong for LSCO and YBCO in the lightly-doped region.\nMoreover, the mesoscopic phase segregation into the metallic paths (charge\nstripes) and the insulating domains (AF regions) offers a natural explanation about why the apparent kF l value can be so small in the regime\nwhere metallic transport is observed.8 Existence of such charged magneticdomain boundaries are actually indicated by our recent in-plane anisotropy\nmeasurements of the magnetic susceptibility of lightly-doped LSCO.22\nOne might wonder about the nature of the Hall effect when the conductivity occurs through the quasi-one-dimensional (1D) stripes. Indeed, it\nwas shown that the Hall effect tends to disappear in La1.4\u2212x Nd0.6 Srx CuO4\n(LNSCO) upon the transition into the static stripe phase.23 Against our\nintuition, however, the quasi-1D motion itself does not necessarily drive\nthe Hall coefficient to zero. The quasi-1D confinement dramatically suppresses the transverse (Hall) current induced by the magnetic field, but the\nsame large transverse resistivity restores the finite Hall voltage, because\nRH \u223c \u03c3xy /\u03c3yy \u03c3xx . For the same reason, for instance, the well-known\ncharge confinement in the CuO2 planes in cuprates does not prevent generation of the Hall voltage along the c-axis (H k ab).24 Therefore, the\nHall-effect anomaly in LNSCO must be caused by some more elaborate\nmechanism rather than simply due to the quasi-1D nature of the transport.\nOne possibility is that the anomaly in LNSCO is due to the peculiar arrangement of stripes which alter their direction from one CuO2 plane to\n\n\f8\n\nanother and thereby keeping \u03c3yy from vanishing; on the other hand, the unidirectional stripes25 in pure LSCO would naturally keep the Hall coefficient\nunchanged, and thus the apparently contrasting behavior of the Hall effect\nin lightly-doped LSCO and LNSCO can be compatible with the existence of\nthe stripes in both systems. Another possible source of difference between\nthe two systems is the particle-hole symmetry inside the stripes: It has\nbeen proposed that the vanishing Hall coefficient in LNSCO is essentially\ndue to the particle-hole symmetry realized by the 1/4-filled nature of the\nstripes near the 1/8 doping;26,27 if, on the other hand, the stripes at small\nx values are not exactly 1/4 filled, it is natural to observe non-vanishing\nHall coefficient in LSCO, in the context of these theories.26,27 Also, it is\npossible that the finite Hall resistivity in LSCO is caused the transverse\nsliding of the stripe as a whole; in fact, very recent optical conductivity\nmeasurements of lightly-doped LSCO have concluded that the sliding degrees of freedom are important for the realization of the metallic transport\nin this system.28\nFrom the above discussion, it is clear that the metallic in-plane charge\ntransport we observe in the AF state is most likely governed by the charge\nstripes. Given the fact that the hole mobility at moderate temperatures\nis surprisingly insensitive to the hole doping all the way up to optimum\ndoping, it is tempting to conclude that the charge transport in cuprates\nthat show the maximal Tc is also governed by the stripes. Recent STM\nstudies of optimally-doped Bi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8+\u03b4 compounds, where periodic\nspacial modulations of the local density of state are observed,29,30 also seem\nto support this conclusion. The implication of such a conclusion on our\nunderstanding of the high-Tc superconductivity is rather significant. Since\nthe ordered static stripes are known to kill superconductivity, it must be the\nfluctuating nature of the stripes that facilitate the superconductivity at such\nhigh temperatures. There are already some theoretical proposals to explain\nthe high-Tc superconductivity on the basis of the fluctuating stripes14,31,32\nor charge fluctuations.33 The system we are dealing with may indeed be the\n\"electronic liquid crystals\",15 which are quantum-fluctuating charge stripe\nstates; our recent studies of the in-plane resistivity anisotropy of lightlydoped cuprates have found21 that the resistivity is smaller along the stripe\ndirection but the magnitude of the anisotropy is strongly dependent on\ntemperature, which suggests a crossover between different electronic liquid\ncrystal phases occurring in the cuprates, and the low-temperature phase\nappears to be an electron nematics.34 Clearly, more experiments are needed\nto fully understand such a new state of matter, and to finally elucidate the\nmechanism of the high-Tc superconductivity.\n\n\f9\n\n5. Summary\nIt is shown that the doped holes in cuprates are surprisingly mobile in\nthe long-range-ordered antiferromagnetic state at moderate temperatures,\nwhich is evidenced both by the metallic \u03c1ab (T ) behavior and by the almost\ntemperature-independent RH (T ). It is emphasized that the mobility of\nthe doped holes at moderate temperatures is virtually unchanged from the\nlightly hole-doped antiferromagnetic compositions (where the dominance of\nthe stripes is very likely) to the optimally-doped superconducting composition, which implies that the charge transport even at optimum doping is\nessentially governed by the stripes.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was done in collaboration with A.
