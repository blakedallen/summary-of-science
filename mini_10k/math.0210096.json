The computation of the equation of H, up to a non-zero constant multiple, is known as the implicitization\nproblem, and is the main purpose of this paper. We examine here this problem, under suitable assumptions, by studying the blow-up algebras associated\nPreprint submitted to Journal of Algebra\n\n31 October 2018\n\n\fto \u03bb. More precisely, we use the acyclicity of the approximation complexes\nintroduced in [24] to develop a new algorithm giving the implicit equation\nH, in case the ideal (f1 , . . . , fn ) is zero-dimensional and locally a complete\nintersection. This algorithm, based on determinants of complexes (also called\nMacRae's invariants) computations, is the main contribution of this paper\namong other related results.\nImplicitization in low dimensions, that is curve and surface implicitizations,\nhave significant applications to the field of computer aided geometric design.\nFor instance it helps drawing a curve or a surface nearby a singularity, computing autointersection of offsets and drafts, or computing the intersection with\nparameterized curves or surfaces. Consequently the implicitization problem\nhas been widely studied and is always an active research area. It is basically\nan elimination problem, and thus can be solved by methods based on Gr\u00f6bner\nbasis computations, using for instance the Buchberger's algorithm, and this\nin all generality. However, in practice it appears that such methods involve\nheavy computations and high complexity, and are hence rarely used. For effective computations, algorithms from the old-fashioned approach of resultants,\ngoing back to the end of the nineteenth century, are preferred, even if they apply only under particular conditions. Moreover they usually give the implicit\nequation as a determinant of a matrix, which is a very useful representation\nwith well-known adapted algorithms for numerical applications. We now survey these methods for curve and surface implicitizations in order to clarify\nwhat is known today, and also to shed light on the contribution of this paper.\n1.1 Overview on curve implicitization\nCurve implicitization is a quite easy problem which is well understood and\nsolved. Let \u03bb be the rational map\nP1k \u2212\u2192 P2k = Proj(k[T1 , T2 , T3 ])\n(X1 : X2 ) 7\u2192 (f1 : f2 : f3 )(X1 , X2 ),\nwhere f1 , f2 , f3 \u2208 k[X1 , X2 ] are homogeneous polynomials of same degree d \u2265 1\nsuch that gcd(f1 , f2 , f3 ) = 1, which implies that \u03bb is regular (i.e. there is no\nbase points). Notice that this last hypothesis is not restrictive because we can\nalways obtain it by dividing each fi , for i = 1, 2, 3, by gcd(f1 , f2 , f3 ). In fact,\nas we will see, the difficulty of the implicitization problem comes from the\npresence of base points, and the case of curve is particularly simple since base\npoints can be easily erased via a single gcd computation. There is roughly\ntwo types of methods to compute the degree d implicit equation of the closed\nimage of \u03bb, which is of the form C(T1 , T2 , T3 )deg(\u03bb) , where C is an irreducible\nhomogeneous polynomial in k[T1 , T2 , T3 ].\n2\n\n\fThe first one is based on a resultant computation. We have the equality\nRes(f1 \u2212 T1 f3 , f2 \u2212 T2 f3 ) = C(T1 , T2 , 1)deg(\u03bb) ,\nwhere Res denotes the classical resultant of two homogeneous polynomials in\nP1k . We can thus obtain the implicit curve as the determinant of the well-known\nSylvester's matrix of both polynomials f1 \u2212 T1 f3 and f2 \u2212 T2 f3 in variables X1\nand X2 . Another matricial formulation is known to compute such a resultant,\nthe Bezout's matrix which is smaller than the Sylvester's matrix. If P (X1 , X2 )\nand Q(X1 , X2 ) are two homogeneous polynomials in k[X1 , X2 ] of the same\ndegree d, the Bezout's matrix Bez(P, Q) is the matrix (ci,j )0\u2264i,j\u2264d\u22121 where the\nci,j 's are the coefficients of the decomposition\nX\nP (S, 1)Q(T, 1) \u2212 P (T, 1)Q(S, 1)\n=\nci,j S i T j .\nS\u2212T\n0\u2264i,j\u2264n\u22121\n\nSince det(Bez(P, Q)) = Res(P, Q) (see e.g. [19]) we have\ndet(Bez(f1 \u2212 T1 f3 , f2 \u2212 T2 f3 )) = C(T1 , T2 , 1)deg(\u03bb) .\nA variation of this formula, due to Kravitsky (see [21], theorem 9.1.11), is\ndet(T1 Bez(f2 , f3 ) + T2 Bez(f3 , f1 ) + T3 Bez(f1 , f2 )) = C(T1 , T2 , T3 )deg(\u03bb)\n(see the appendix A at the end of the paper for a proof in the general context\nof anisotropic resultant). Notice that these resultant-based formulations have\na big advantage, they give a generic implicitization formula, that is computations can be made with generic coefficients of polynomials f1 , f2 , f3 , and then\nall possible implicit equations are obtained as a specialization of a generic\nformula.\nMore recently a new method has been developed for curve implicitization,\ncalled the \"moving lines\" method. It was introduced by T. Sederberg and F.\nChen in [23]. This method is based on the study of the first syzygies of the\nhomogeneous ideal I = (f1 , f2 , f3 ) \u2282 k[X1 , X2 ] in appropriate degrees (recall\nthat we always suppose that gcd(f1 , f2 , f3 ) = 1). A moving line of degree \u03bd is\na homogeneous polynomial\na1 (X1 , X2 )T1 + a2 (X1 , X2 )T2 + a3 (X1 , X2 )T3 ,\nwhere a1 , a2 , a3 are homogeneous polynomials in k[X1 , X2 ]\u03bd , which is said to\nfollow the implicit curve if it vanishes when substituting each Ti by fi , for\ni = 1, 2, 3. In other words the triple (a1 , a2 , a3 ) is a syzygy of degree \u03bd of\nthe ideal I. Choosing d moving lines L1 , . . . , Ld of degree d \u2212 1 following the\nimplicit curve, we can construct a square matrix M of size d \u00d7d corresponding\nto the k[T1 , T2 , T3 ]-module map\n3\n\n\f\u2295di=1 k[T1 , T2 , T3 ] \u2212\u2192 (k[X1 , X2 ]d\u22121 ) \u2297k k[T1 , T2 , T3 ]\n(p1 , p2 , . . . , pd ) 7\u2192\n\nd\nX\n\npi Li .\n\ni=1\n\nIt can be shown that one can always choose L1 , . . . , Ld such that the determinant of M is non-zero, and in this case it equals what one wants, that is\nC(T1 , T2 , T3 )deg(\u03bb) (see [8]). This method hence yields an alternative to resultant computations, but however, it is not a generic method.\nFor curve implicitization the two methods we have recalled work well and give\nthe desired result, but, as we are now going to see, it is no longer true for\nsurface implicitization where the situation becomes more intricate.\n1.2 Overview on surface implicitization\nConsider the rational map \u03bb\nP2k \u2212\u2192 P3k = Proj(k[T1 , T2 , T3 , T4 ])\n(X1 : X2 : X3 ) 7\u2192 (f1 : f2 : f3 : f4 )(X1 , X2 , X3 ),\nwhere f1 , f2 , f3 , f4 \u2208 k[X1 , X2 , X3 ] are homogeneous polynomials of same degree d \u2265 1, that we always suppose to be generically finite. Surface implicitization problem consists in computing the implicit equation of the closed image\nof \u03bb, which is a hypersurface of P3k of the form S(T1 , T2 , T3 , T4 )deg(\u03bb) , with S\nirreducible. It is much more difficult than curve implicitization problem and,\nas far as we know, is unsolved in all generality (always without using Gr\u00f6bner\nbasis). Here again we suppose that gcd(f1 , f2 , f3 , f4 ) = 1, which is not restrictive as we have seen in the preceding paragraph. However this hypothesis\nonly erases base points in purely codimension 1 here, and hence it remains\na finite set of isolated base points, possibly empty, that we denote by B. We\nknow then that the equation of the closed image of \u03bb is a hypersurface of deP\ngree (d2 \u2212 p\u2208B ep )/deg(\u03bb), where ep denotes the algebraic multiplicity of the\npoint p \u2208 B (see theorem 2.5, or [8], appendix). As for curve implicitization,\ntwo types of methods have been developed to solve the surface implicitization\nproblem: methods based on resultant computations, and the method called\n\"moving surfaces\". We begin with the first, which is also the oldest one.\nIf there is no base point (i.e. B = \u2205), one easily shows that\nRes(f1 \u2212 T1 f4 , f2 \u2212 T2 f4 , f3 \u2212 T3 f4 ) = S(T1 , T2 , T3 , 1)deg(\u03bb) ,\nwhere Res denotes the classical resultant of three homogeneous polynomials in\nP2 . This resultant can be computed with the well-known Macaulay's matrices,\n4\n\n\fbut this involves gcd computations since the determinant of each Macaulay's\nmatrix gives only a multiple of this resultant. In order to be efficient, direct\nmethods, avoiding these gcd computations, have been proposed. The general\ncase of an implicit surface without base points is solved in [18], 5.3.17, using\nthe anisotropic resultant; the implicit hypersurface of \u03bb is then obtained as the\ndeterminant of a square matrix (notice that this result was rediscovered in [1],\nin a more geometrical setting, but only in some particular cases). As always\nwith resultant-based methods, the formula is generic, i.e. computations can be\ndone with indeterminate coefficients, giving the desired implicit equation as a\nspecialization of a generic equation. If base points exist the preceding resultant\nvanishes identically, but we can use other constructions of resultants, taking\ninto account base points, as the reduced resultant (see [18], 5.3.29) or the\nresidual resultant (see [5]). In [6], the residual resultant is used to solve the\nsurface implicitization problem if the ideal of base points is a local complete\nintersection satisfying some more technical conditions (see [6], theorem 3.2;\nfor instance, if the ideal (f1 , f2 , f3 , f4 ) is saturated the method failed). This\nmethod has the disadvantage of requiring the knowledge of the ideal of base\npoints, but however it has the advantage of giving a generic formula for all\nparameterizations admitting the same ideal of base points.\nWe now briefly overview the second announced method, the \"moving surfaces\"\nmethod which has also been introduced in [23]. We first suppose that B =\n\u2205. The two main ingredients of this method are moving planes and moving\nquadrics. Like curves, a moving plane of degree \u03bd following the surface is a\npolynomial in k[X1 , X2 , X3 ][T1 , T2 , T3 , T4 ] of the form\na1 (X1 , X2 , X3 )T1 + a2 (X1 , X2 , X3 )T2 + a3 (X1 , X2 , X3 )T3 + a4 (X1 , X2 , X3 )T4 ,\nwhere a1 , a2 , a3 and a4 are homogeneous polynomials in k[X1 , X2 , X3 ]\u03bd , such\nthat it vanishes if we replace each Ti by fi . In a similar way, a moving quadric\nof degree \u03bd following the surface is a polynomial of the form\na1,1 (X1 , X2 , X3 )T12 + a1,2 (X1 , X2 , X3 )T1 T2 + . . . + a4,4 (X1 , X2 , X3 )T42 ,\nwhere ai,j 's, with 1 \u2264 i \u2264 j \u2264 4, are also homogeneous polynomials in\nk[X1 , X2 , X3 ]\u03bd , such that it vanishes if we replace each Ti by fi . Choosing\nd moving planes L1 , . . . , Ln and l = (d2 \u2212 d)/2 moving quadrics Q1 , . . . , Ql of\ndegree d\u22121 which follow the surface, we can construct a square matrix, say M,\ncorresponding to the k[T]-module map (where k[T] denotes k[T1 , T2 , T3 , T4 ])\n\u0010\n\n\u2295di=1 k[T]\n\n\u0011M\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u2295lj=1 k[T] \u2192 (k[X1 , X2 , X3 ]d\u22121 ) \u2297k k[T]\n\n(p1 , . . . , pd , q1 , . . . , ql ) \u2192\n\nd\nX\n\npi Li +\n\nl\nX\n\nj=1\n\ni=1\n\n5\n\nqi Qi .\n\n\fIt can be shown that it is always possible to choose L1 , . . . , Ln and Q1 , . . . , Ql\nso that det(M) is non-zero and then equals S deg(\u03bb) (see [10]). In the recent paper [7], this method was improved: a similar matrix is constructed such that\nits determinant is the implicit surface, providing \u03bb is birational and the base\npoints ideal is locally a complete intersection satisfying also some other technical conditions (for instance the method rarely works if the ideal (f1 , . . . , f4 )\nis saturated).\n\n1.3 Contents of the paper\n\nAs we have already mentioned, this article is centered on the implicitization\nproblem. However we also develop some other results which are closely related.\nAfter this quite long introduction, the paper is organized as follows.\nSection 2 regroups some results on the geometry of the closed image of a rational map \u03bb from Proj(A), where A is a Z-graded algebra, to Proj(k[T1 , . . . , Tn ]),\nwhere k is only supposed to be a commutative ring, given by n homogeneous\nelements f1 , . . . , fn in A of the same degree d \u2265 1. We first give the ideal of\ndefinition of the scheme-theoretic image of \u03bb, that we will also called hereafter\nthe closed image of \u03bb, and then prove that \u03bb can be extended to a projective\nmorphism by blowing-up. We end this section with a theorem on the degree\nof the closed image of \u03bb, giving a closed formula to compute it, providing k is\na field, A is a N-graded finitely generated k-algebra without zero divisors, \u03bb\nis generically finite (onto its image) and its base points are isolated.\nIn section 3, we link the definition ideal of the closed image of \u03bb to the symmetric and Rees algebras associated to the ideal I = (f1 , . . . , fn ) of the Z-graded\nalgebra A. We also investigate what happens when the ideal I is of linear type,\nthat is the Rees algebra and the symmetric algebra of I are isomorphic. We\nroughly prove that it is possible to \"read\" the definition ideal of the closed\nimage of \u03bb from these blow-up algebras.\nThe section 4 is devoted to the so-called approximation complexes introduced\nby A. Simis and W.V. Vasconcelos in [24]. In a first part we introduce these\ncomplexes, recalling their definitions and their basic, but very useful, properties. In a second part, having in mind to apply them to the implicitization\nproblem, we prove two new acyclicity criterions for the first approximation\ncomplex associated to the ideal I, under suitable assumptions. The last part\nof this section deals with a problem introduced by D. Cox and solved by himself and H. Schenck in [9]: being given a homogeneous ideal I = (a1 , a2 , a3 ) of\nP2 of codimension two, the module of syzygies of I vanishing at the scheme\nlocus V (I) is generated by the Koszul sygyzies if and only if V (I) is a local\ncomplete intersection in P2 . We show that this problem appears naturally in\n6\n\n\fthe setting of the approximation complexes. This allows us to generalize this\nresult to higher dimensions, and observe that the \"natural\" condition on I is\nnot to be a local complete intersection, but to be syzygetic.\nFinally, in section 5, we investigate the implicitization problem with the tools\nwe have developed in the previous sections. We suppose here that k is a field,\nA is the polynomial ring k[X1 , . . . , Xn\u22121 ], and \u03bb is generically finite (so that\nthe closed image of \u03bb is a hypersurface of Pkn\u22121 ). Using the acyclicity criterions\nwe proved in section 4, we show that an equation of the closed image of \u03bb is\nobtained as the determinant of each degree \u03bd, with \u03bd \u2265 (n \u2212 2)(d \u2212 1), part\nof the first approximation complex associated to I, under the hypothesis that\nI is either such that V (I) = \u2205 or a local complete intersection in Proj(A)\nof codimension n \u2212 2 (isolated base points). This new algorithm improves\nin particular the known techniques (not involving Gr\u00f6bner basis) to solve\ncurve and surface implicitizations. For curve implicitization, this algorithm is\nexactly the moving lines method in case gcd(f1 , f2 , f3 ) = 1, but its formalism\nshows clearly (in our point of view) why d \u2212 1 is the good degree of moving\nlines to consider. Moreover if we do not suppose gcd(f1 , f2 , f3 ) = 1, then\nour algorithm also applies. For surface implicitization, our algorithm works\nif the ideal I = (f1 , . . . , f4 ) defines local complete intersection base points\nof codimension 2. Comparing with the method of moving surfaces (and its\nimprovement) and the resultant-based methods, it is more general since both\npreceding methods sometimes failed in this situation. We would like to mention\nthat we have implemented our algorithm in the MAGMA language. This choice\nwas guided by its needs: it just uses linear algebra, and more precisely linear\nsystems solving routines.\nThis work is based on a course given by Jean-Pierre Jouanolou at the University Louis Pasteur of Strasbourg (France) during the academic year 2000-2001.\nNotation: Let R be a commutative ring. If I is an ideal of R, we will denote I \u223c its associated sheaf of ideals on Spec(R). If the ring R is supposed to\nbe Z-graded, we will denote Proj(R) the quotient of Spec(R) \\ V (m) by the\nmultiplicative group Gm , where m is the ideal of R generated by all the homogeneous elements of non-zero degree. If I is supposed to be an homogeneous\nideal of R we will denote I # its associated sheaf of ideals on Proj(R). If in\naddition the ring R is supposed to be Z \u00d7 Z-graded, we will denote Biproj(R)\nthe quotient of Spec(R) \\ V (\u03c4 ) by the group Gm \u00d7 Gm , where \u03c4 is the ideal of\nR generated by all the products of two bihomogeneous elements of bidegree\n(0, a) and (b, 0) such that a 6= 0 and b 6= 0. If I is supposed to be a bihomogeneous ideal of R, then we will denote I ## its associated sheaf of ideals on\nBiproj(R).\nFinally, if R is a commutative ring and if J and I are two ideals of R, we\ndefine the ideal of inertia forms (or Tr\u00e4gheitsformen) of I with respect to J\n7\n\n\fto be\nTFJ (I) := \u222an\u2208N (I :R J n ) = {a \u2208 R such that \u2203n \u2208 N \u2200\u03be \u2208 J n : a\u03be \u2208 I}.\n\n2\n\nThe geometry of the closed image of a rational map\n\nLet k be a commutative ring, A a Z-graded k-algebra, and denote by \u03c4 : k \u2192\nA0 the canonical morphism of rings. Suppose given two integers n \u2265 1 and\nd \u2265 1, and also an element fi \u2208 Ad for each i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n}. The k-algebra\nmorphism\nh : k[T1 , . . . , Tn ] \u2212\u2192 A\n7\u2192 fi\n\nTi\nyields a k-scheme morphism\n\n\u03bc : \u222ani=1 D(fi ) \u2212\u2192 \u222ani=1 D(Ti ) = (Ank )\u2217 ,\nwhere Ank denotes the affine space of dimension n over k, and (Ank )\u2217 this affine\nspace without the origin. If we quotient the morphism \u03bc by the action of the\nmultiplicative group Gm , we obtain another k-scheme morphism,\n\u03bb : \u222ani=1 D+ (fi ) \u2212\u2192 Pkn\u22121 = Proj(k[T1 , . . . , Tn ]),\n\n(1)\n\nand the following commutative diagram:\nD(f) := \u222ani=1 D(fi )\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\nProj\uf8e6\ny\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 (Ank )\u2217\n\n\u03bb\n\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\nProj\uf8e6\ny\n\nD+ (f) := \u222ani=1 D+ (fi ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Pkn\u22121 .\nThe main aim of this paper is to provide a \"formula\" for the closure of the\nset-theoretic images of the maps \u03bb and \u03bc in case they are hypersurfaces. It\nturns out that, under suitable assumption, the closure of a set-theoretic image\nof a scheme morphism have a natural scheme structure called the scheme\u03c1\ntheoretic image. More precisely, if X \u2212\n\u2192 Y is a morphism of schemes, then its\nscheme-theoretic image exists if, for instance, \u03c1\u2217 (OX ) is quasi-coherent. It is\nthe smallest closed subscheme of Y containing the set-theoretic image of \u03c1. Its\nassociated ideal sheaf is given by ker(\u03c1# : OY \u2192 \u03c1\u2217 OX ) and it is supported on\nthe closure of its set-theoretic image (see [13] I.6.10.5 for more details). The\nfirst part of this section is devoted to the description of the scheme-theoretic\nimage of the map \u03bb (and \u03bc): we give its sheaf of ideals on Pkn\u22121 , and a projective\nmorphism which extends it. In a second part we prove a formula to compute\n8\n\n\fthe degree of the scheme-theoretic image of \u03bb in case elements f1 , . . . , fn define\na finite number of points in A (possibly zero). This formula generalizes the\none commonly uses when dealing with the implicitization problem to obtain\nthe degree of a parameterized surface of P3 (see e.g. [8], appendix).\n2.1 The ideal of the closed image of \u03bb\nWe begin here by the description of the ideal sheaf of the scheme-theoretic\nimage, that we will also often called the closed image, of \u03bb (and \u03bc).\nTheorem 2.1 The scheme-theoretic images of the respective morphisms \u03bc\nand \u03bb are given by\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nV (ker(h)\u223c )|(Ank )\u2217 = V TF(T1 ,...,Tn ) (ker(h))\u223c\nand\n\n|(An\n)\u2217\nk\n\n,\n\nV (ker(h)# ) = V TF(T1 ,...,Tn ) (ker(h))# .\nProof. First notice that for all i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n}, the restriction \u03bc|D(fi ) is the\nspectrum of the morphism of rings k[T1 , . . . , Tn ]Ti \u2192 Afi , obtained from h by\nlocalization. Since \u03bc\u22121 (D(Ti )) = D(fi ) for all i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n}, it follows that\n\u03bc is an affine morphism. Now denote by j the canonical inclusion (Ank )\u2217 \u0592\u2192 Ank .\nThe sheaf OD(f ) is quasi-coherent and the morphism j \u25e6\u03bc is quasi-compact and\nseparated (since it is affine), so we deduce that (j \u25e6\u03bc)\u2217 (OD(f ) ) is quasi-coherent\n(see [14], prop. II.5.8), and we obtain\n(j \u25e6 \u03bc)\u2217 (OD(f ) ) = ker(\n\nn\nY\n\nAfi \u2192\n\ni=1\n\nand also\n\u03bc\u2217 (OD(f ) ) = ker(\n\nn\nY\n\nAfi fj )\u223c,\n\n1\u2264i,j\u2264n, i6=j\n\nY\n\nAfi \u2192\n\ni=1\n\nY\n\nAfi fj )\u223c|(An )\u2217 .\n\n1\u2264i,j\u2264n, i6=j\n\nk\n\nNotice that ker( Afi \u2192 Afi fj ) is a k[T1 , . . . , Tn ]-module via the map h.\nFrom here the kernel of the canonical morphism O(Ank )\u2217 \u2192 \u03bc\u2217 OD(f ) is exactly\nQ\n\nQ\n\nh\n\nker( k[T1 , . . . , Tn ] \u2212\n\u2192 ker(\n\nn\nY\n\nAfi \u2192\n\n1\u2264i,j\u2264n\n\ni=1\nh\n\n= ker(k[T1 , . . . , Tn ] \u2212\n\u2192\n\nY\n\nA\n\n0\nH(f\n(A)\n1 ,...,fn )\n\u223c\n= (TF(T1 ,...,Tn ) (ker(h))) |(An )\u2217\nk\n= ker(h)\u223c|(An )\u2217 ,\nk\n\n9\n\n)\u223c|(An )\u2217\nk\n\nAfi fj ) )\u223c|(An )\u2217\nk\n\n\fand this proves the first statement of the proposition. If we quotient by the\naction of the multiplicative group Gm we obtain\nker(OPn\u22121 \u2192 \u03bb\u2217 (OD+ (f ) )) = (TF(T1 ,...,Tn ) (ker(h)))# = ker(h)#\nk\n\nwhich is the second statement.\n\n\u2737\n\nRemark 2.2 The ideal TF(T1 ,...,Tn ) (ker(h)) is often called the saturated ideal\n0\nof ker(h) in k[T1 , . . . , Tn ]. Also, in the case where H(f\n(A) = 0 we have\n1 ,...,fn )\nker(h) = TF(T1 ,...,Tn ) (ker(h)), i.e. ker(h) is saturated, and hence, for all \u03bd \u2208 Z,\nker(h)\u03bd \u2243 H 0 (Pkn\u22121 , ker(h)# (\u03bd)).\nNow we show that the map \u03bb can be extended to a projective morphism whose\nimage is the closed image of \u03bb. This result is quite classical (see for instance\n[14], II.7.17.3), but we prefer to detail it, giving a particular attention to\ngraduations.\nFirst of all we set the indeterminates T1 , . . . , Tn to degree 1, the usual choice\nto construct Pkn\u22121 = Proj(k[T1 , . . . , Tn ]). It follows that the ring\nA[T1 , . . . , Tn ] = A \u2297k k[T1 , . . . , Tn ]\nis naturally bi-graded by the tensor product graduation associated to the\ngraduations of A and k[T1 , . . . , Tn ]. Let Z be a new indeterminate and set its\ndegree to 1 \u2212 d. In this way the Z \u00d7 Z-graded A-algebra morphism\nA[T1 , . . . , Tn ] \u2212\u2192 A[Z, Z \u22121 ]\nTi 7\u2192 fi Z\n\n(2)\n\nis homogeneous, and hence gives a natural Z \u00d7 Z-graduation to its image: the\nRees algebra ReesA (I), where I = (f1 , . . . , fn ) \u2282 A. For this graduation, we\ndenote by BlI the blow-up\nBlI = Biproj(ReesA (I)) \u2282 Biproj(A[T1 , . . . , Tn ]) = Proj(A) \u00d7k Pkn\u22121 ,\nand respectively by u and v the two canonical projections\nu\n\nv\n\nBlI \u2212\n\u2192 Proj(A) and BlI \u2212\n\u2192 Pkn\u22121 .\nSince Ip = Ap for all p \u2208 D+ (f), the restriction of u to \u03a9 = u\u22121 (D+ (f)) is\nan isomorphism from \u03a9 to D+ (f). The following proposition shows that the\nmorphism of k-schemes v extends the morphism \u03bb by identifying \u03a9 with D+ (f)\nvia u|\u03a9 .\n\n10\n\n\fProposition 2.3 With the above notations, the following diagram is commutative:\n\u03a9\n\u2745\n\u2745 v|\u03a9\nu|\u03a9 \u2240\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2758\n\u2744\n\u03bb \u2732 n\u22121\nD+ (f)\nP\nk\n\nProof. Setting the weights of the indeterminates T1 , . . . , Tn to d and Z to 0,\nwe obtain two graded k-algebra morphisms\nh\n\nincl \u25e6 h : k[T1 , . . . , Tn ] \u2212\n\u2192 A \u0592\u2192 ReesA (I) \u2282 A[Z, Z \u22121 ]\nTi 7\u2192 fi\nand\n\u03c1 : k[T1 , . . . , Tn ] \u2212\u2192 ReesA (I) \u2282 A[Z, Z \u22121]\nTi 7\u2192 fi Z.\nLet i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n} be fixed. Over D+ (Ti ) \u2282 Pkn\u22121 , the map \u03bb \u25e6 u|\u03a9 is affine,\nassociated to the k-algebra morphism\n(incl \u25e6 h)i : k[T1 , . . . , Tn ](Ti ) \u2212\u2192 (ReesA (I))(fi ) \u0592\u2192 A(fi ) [Z, Z \u22121 ]\nTj /Ti 7\u2192 fj /fi ,\nand the map v|\u03a9 is also affine, associated to the k-algebra morphism\n\u03c1i : k[T1 , . . . , Tn ](Ti ) \u2212\u2192 ReesA (I)(fi Z) \u2282 A(fi ) [Z, Z \u22121]\nTj /Ti 7\u2192 fj Z/fi Z.\nThis clearly shows that \u03c1i (Tj /Ti ) = fj /fi = (incl \u25e6 h)i in A(fi ) [Z, Z \u22121 ], which\nimplies the proposition.\n\u2737\n\n2.2 The degree of the closed image of \u03bb\nIn what follows we give an explicit formula to compute the degree of the\nclosed image of \u03bb, that is the image of v, providing that Proj(A/I) is a zerodimensional scheme (possibly empty), where I denotes the ideal (f1 , . . . , fn ).\n11\n\n\fFor this we first fix some notation about multiplicities (we refer to [3] for a\ncomplete treatment on the subject), and recall some classical results.\nFrom now we suppose that k is a field and we denote by C the N-graded\npolynomial ring k[X1 , . . . , Xr ] with deg(Xi ) = 1 for all i = 1, . . . , r. For all\nZ-graded finite C-module M one defines the Hilbert series of M:\nHM (T ) =\n\nX\n\ndimk (M\u03bd )T \u03bd .\n\n\u03bd\u2208Z\n\nIf \u03b4 denotes the Krull dimension of M, there exists a unique polynomial LM (T )\nsuch that LM (1) 6= 0 and\nHM (T ) =\n\nX\n\ndimk (M\u03bd )T \u03bd =\n\n\u03bd\u2208Z\n\nLM (T )\n.\n(1 \u2212 T )\u03b4\n\nThe number LM (1) is an invariant of the module M called the multiplicity\nof M; we will denote it by multk (M) := LM (1). Another way to obtain this\ninvariant is the Hilbert polynomial of M, denoted PM (X). It is a polynomial\nof degree \u03b4 \u2212 1 such that PM (\u03bd) = dimk (M\u03bd ) for all sufficiently large \u03bd \u2208 N.\nThe Hilbert polynomial is of the form\nPM (X) =\n\na\u03b4\u22121\nX \u03b4\u22121 + . . . + a0 ,\n(\u03b4 \u2212 1)!\n\nand we have the equality multk (M) = LM (1) = a\u03b4\u22121 . One can also define it\nas the Euler characteristic of M \u266f on Pkr\u22121 , that is for all \u03bd \u2208 Z we have:\nPM (\u03bd) = \u03c7(Pkr\u22121 , M \u266f (\u03bd)) =\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)i dimk H i (Pkr\u22121 , M \u266f (\u03bd)).\n\n(3)\n\ni\u22650\n\nA well-known formula relates the Hilbert series and the Hilbert polynomial:\nfor all \u03bd \u2208 Z\nHM (T )|T \u03bd \u2212 PM (\u03bd) =\n\nX\n\ni\n(\u22121)i dimk Hm\n(M)\u03bd ,\n\n(4)\n\ni\u22650\n\nwhere HM (T )|T \u03bd is the coefficient of T \u03bd in the Hilbert series HM (T ), that\nis dimk (M\u03bd ), and m is the irrelevant ideal of k[X1 , . . . , Xr ], that is m =\n(X1 , . . . , Xr ). Recall also that for all i > 0\ni+1\nH i (Pkn\u22121 , M \u266f (\u03bd)) \u2243 Hm\n(M)\u03bd ,\n\nand that, for all \u03bd \u2208 Z, we have an exact sequence:\n0\n1\n0 \u2192 Hm\n(M)\u03bd \u2192 M\u03bd \u2192 H 0 (Pkn\u22121 , M \u266f (\u03bd)) \u2192 Hm\n(M)\u03bd \u2192 0.\n\n(5)\n\nSuch a definition of multiplicity for M is called a geometric multiplicity and is\nalso often called the degree of M because of its geometric meaning. Indeed let J\n12\n\n\fbe a graded ideal of C and consider the quotient ring R = C/J. If \u03b4 denotes the\ndimension of R then the subscheme Proj(R) of Pkn\u22121 is of dimension \u03b4 \u2212 1. The\ndegree of Proj(R) over Pkn\u22121 is defined to be the number of points obtained by\ncutting Proj(R) by \u03b4 \u22121 generic linear forms. To be more precise, if l1 , . . . , l\u03b4\u22121\nare generic linear forms of Pkn\u22121 , then the scheme S = Proj(R/(l1 , . . . , l\u03b4\u22121 ))\nis finite and we set\ndegPr\u22121 (Proj(R)) := dimk \u0393(S, OS ) = dimk\nk\n\nR\u03bd\n(l1 , . . . , l\u03b4\u22121 )\u03bd\n\n!\n\n,\n\nfor all sufficiently large \u03bd. This geometric degree is in fact exactly what we\ncalled the multiplicity of R, i.e. we have\ndegPr\u22121 (Proj(R)) = multk (R) = LM (1) = ad\u22121 .\nk\n\nThis equality follows immediately from the exact sequence\n\u00d7l\n\n1\n0 \u2192 R(\u22121) \u2212\u2212\u2192\nR \u2192 R/(l1 ) \u2192 0\n\nwhich gives HR/(l1 ) (T ) = (1 \u2212 T )HR (T ) = LM (T )/(1 \u2212 T )\u03b4\u22121 , and an easy\nrecursion.\nAt this point we can compute the multiplicity of a Veronese module which\nwill be useful later.\nLemma 2.4 Let M be a Z-graded finite C-module. We denote by M (d) , for all\nL\nintegers d, the Veronese module \u03bd\u2208Z Md\u03bd which is a k[X1d , . . . , Xnd]-module.\nSetting \u03b4 = dimk (M) we have:\nmultk (M (d) ) = d\u03b4\u22121 multk (M).\nProof. Let d be a fixed integer. It is known that for all integers \u03bd the sum\nP\n\u03bd\n\u03be d =1 \u03be , where the sum is taken over all the d-unit roots, equals d if \u03bd divides\nd and zero otherwise.

Let (R, m) be\na local noetherian ring and M 6= 0 a finite R-module. Let I \u2282 m be an ideal\nof R such that there exists an integer t satisfying mt M \u2282 IM (any such ideal\nis called a definition ideal of M), the numerical function length(M/I \u03bd M) is\na polynomial function for sufficiently large values of \u03bd \u2208 N. This polynomial,\ndenoted SIM (X), is called the Hilbert-Samuel polynomial of M with respect to\nI. It is of degree \u03b4 = dimk (M) and of the form:\nSIM (X) =\n\ne(I, M) \u03b4\nX + terms of lower powers in X.\n\u03b4!\n\nThe algebraic multiplicity of I in M is the number e(I, M) appearing in this\npolynomial. With such a definition of algebraic multiplicity one can define\nthe algebraic multiplicity of a zero-dimensional scheme as follows: let J be a\ngraded ideal of a N-graded ring R, then if T = Proj(R/J) is a finite subscheme\nof Proj(R), its algebraic multiplicity is\ne(T, Proj(R)) = e(J \u266f , R\u266f ) =\n\nX\n\ne(Jt\u266f , OProj(R),t ) =\n\nt\u2208T\n\nX\n\ne(Jt , Rt ).\n\nt\u2208T\n\nWe are now ready to state the main result of this section.\nTheorem 2.5 Suppose that k is a field and A a N-graded k-algebra of the\nform k[X1 , . . . , Xr ]/J, where J is a prime homogeneous ideal and each Xi is\nof degree one. Denote by \u03b4 the dimension of A and let I = (f1 , . . . , fn ) be an\nideal of A such that each fi is of degree d \u2265 1. Then, if T = Proj(A/I) is\nfinite over k, the number d\u03b4\u22121 degPr\u22121 (Proj(A)) \u2212 e(T, Proj(A)) equals\nk\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 deg(\u03bb).deg\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f30\n\n(S)\nPn\u22121\nk\n\nif \u03bb is generically finite\n\nif \u03bb is not generically finite,\n\nwhere S denotes the closed image of \u03bb (i.e. the image of v).\nProof. We denote by C the polynomial ring k[X1 , . . . , Xr ] and consider it as a\nN-graded ring by setting deg(Xi ) = 1 for all i = 1, . . . , r. We denote also by m\nits irrelevant ideal m = (X1 , . . . , Xr ), and for simplicity we set X = Proj(A).\nThe k-algebra A is a N-graded C-module and combining (3) and (4) we obtain\nfor all \u03bd \u2208 N\ndimk (Ad\u03bd ) = \u03c7(X, OX (d\u03bd)) +\n\nX\n\ni\n(\u22121)i dimk Hm\n(A)d\u03bd .\n\n(6)\n\ni\u22650\n\nSimilarly, for all \u03bd \u2208 N the ideal I \u03bd of A is also a N-graded C-module. We\n14\n\n\fhence deduce that for all \u03bd \u2208 N\ndimk ((I \u03bd )d\u03bd ) = \u03c7(X, (I \u03bd )\u266f (d\u03bd)) +\n\nX\n\ni\n(\u22121)i dimk Hm\n(I \u03bd )d\u03bd .\n\n(7)\n\ni\u22650\n\nNow the exact sequence of sheaves on X\n0 \u2192 (I \u03bd )# (d\u03bd) \u2192 OX (d\u03bd) \u2192\n\nOX\n(d\u03bd) \u2192 0,\n(I \u03bd )#\n\nshows that, always for all \u03bd \u2208 N,\n\u03c7(X, OX (d\u03bd)) \u2212 \u03c7(X, (I \u03bd )\u266f (d\u03bd)) = \u03c7(X,\n\nOX\n(d\u03bd)).\n(I \u03bd )#\n\nSince T = Proj(A/I) is supposed to be finite, for all integers \u03bd we have\n\u03c7(X,\n\nOX\n(d\u03bd)) = \u03c7(X, OX /(I \u03bd )\u266f ) = dimk H 0 (X, OX /(I \u03bd )\u266f ),\n(I \u03bd )\u266f\n\nwhere the last equality comes from (3). Subtracting (7) to (6), it follows that\nfor all integers \u03bd\ndimk (A\u03bd(d) ) \u2212 dimk ((I \u03bd )d\u03bd ) = dimk H 0 (X, OX /(I \u03bd )\u266f ) +\n\nX\ni\n(\u22121)i dimk Hm\n(A)d\u03bd\ni\u22650\n\nX\ni\n\u2212\n(\u22121)i dimk Hm\n(I \u03bd )d\u03bd ,\ni\u22650\n\ni\nand for all \u03bd \u2208 N sufficiently large (recall that Hm\n(A)\u03bd = 0 for i \u2265 0 and\n\u03bd \u226b 0)\n\ndimk (A\u03bd(d) ) \u2212 dimk ((I \u03bd )d\u03bd ) = dimk H 0 (X, OX /(I \u03bd )\u266f ) \u2212\n\nX\n\ni\n(\u22121)i dimk Hm\n(I \u03bd )d\u03bd . (8)\n\ni\u22650\n\nAt this point, notice that the algebraic multiplicity e(T, X) appears naturally\nin this formula. Indeed, for all \u03bd \u226b 0,\ndimk H 0 (X, OX /(I \u03bd )\u266f ) =\n\nX\n\nlength(At /It\u03bd ) =\n\nt\u2208T\n\ne(T, X) \u03b4\n\u03bd + R(\u03bd),\n\u03b4!\n\nwhere R is a polynomial in k[\u03bd] of degree stricly less than \u03b4.\nNow we relate (8) with the Rees algebra of I. Recall that we have a map\nh : k[T1 , . . . , Tn ] \u2192 A which sends each Ti to the polynomial fi \u2208 Ad . The\npolynomial ring k[T1 , . . . , Tn ] is naturally N-graded by setting deg(Ti ) = 1 for\ni = 1, . . . , n. We have the following exact sequence of N-graded k[T1 , . . . , Tn ]modules\nh\n0 \u2192 ker(h) \u2192 k[T1 , . . . , Tn ] \u2212\n\u2192 Im(h) \u2192 0.\n15\n\n\fFrom the definition of the map h it comes Im(h)\u03bd = I \u03bd \u2229 Ad\u03bd = (I \u03bd )d\u03bd , and\nhence dimk ((I \u03bd )d\u03bd ) = dimk (Im(h)\u03bd ), for all \u03bd \u2208 N. The Rees algebra of I, that\nwe denote hereafter by B, is the image of the following A-algebra morphism\n\u03b2\n\nA[T1 , . . . , Tn ] \u2212\n\u2192 B := ReesI (A) \u2282 A[Z]\nTi 7\u2192 fi Z.\nAs A is N-graded, B is naturally Z \u00d7 Z-graded if \u03b2 is a homogeneous map,\nthat is if deg(Ti ) = d + deg(Z), for all i = 1, . . . , n. We choose deg(Ti ) = 0 for\ni = 1, . . . , n, and hence deg(Z) = \u2212d (notice that B has its own grading as a\nA-algebra, so this choice do not interfere with the grading\nof C). In this way\nL\nq\nBp,q = Ip+dq\nfor all (p, q) \u2208 Z \u00d7 Z, and hence Bp,\u2022 = q\u2208Z I q (dq)p . It follows\nL\nthat B = q\u22650 I q (dq) as a N-graded A-module. Hereafter we will denote by\nBp the graded part\nof B as a A-module, that L\nis Bp := Bp,\u2022 . It is then easy to\nL\ni\ni\n(I q )dq = Hm\n(B)0 , both\ncheck that B0 = q\u22650 (I q ) \u2229 Adq = Im(h) and q\u22650 Hm\nas N-graded k[T1 , . . . , Tn ]-modules. Finally (8) can be rewritten as\ndimk (A\u03bd(d) ) \u2212 dimk H 0 (X, OX /(I \u03bd )\u266f ) = dimk (B0,\u03bd ) \u2212\n\nX\ni\n(B)0,\u03bd ), (9)\n(\u22121)i dimk (Hm\ni\u22650\n\nalways for all integers \u03bd sufficiently large.\nWe are now ready to prove the second assertion of this theorem. Denoting\np = (ker(h)) \u2282 k[T1 , . . . , Tn ], if we suppose that the map \u03bb is not generically\ni\nfinite, then dim(k[T1 , . . . , Tn ]/p) < \u03b4 = dim(A). Since B0 and Hm\n(B)0 , with\ni\ni \u2265 0, are k[T1 , . . . , Tn ]/p-modules, we deduce that B0 and Hm(B)0 , for all\ni \u2265 0, have Hilbert polynomials of degree strictly less than dim(A). But the\nleft side of equality (9) is a polynomial of degree \u03b4 with leading coefficient\nd\u03b4\u22121 multk (A) \u2212 e(T, Proj(A))\n,\n\u03b4!\nand thus we obtain the second statement of this theorem (notice that we did\nnot use here the hypothesis J is prime).\nWe now concentrate on the first point of this theorem. We denote ProjA (B)\nthe Proj of B as a N-graded A-module, so that (5) gives (in a more general\nsetting, see [11] theorem A4.1), for all \u03bd \u2208 N, the exact sequence of N-graded\nk[T1 , . . . , Tn ]-modules:\n0\n1\n0 \u2192 Hm\n(B)0 \u2192 B0 \u2192 \u0393(ProjA (B), OProjA (B) ) \u2192 Hm\n(B)0 \u2192 0.\n\n(10)\n\nNow remark that \u03bb is generically finite if and only if the morphism v :\nProjA (B) \u2192 Spec(k[T1 , . . . , Tn ]/p), associated to the canonical morphism\nk[T1 , . . . , Tn ]/p \u2192 B sending each Ti to fi Z, is also generically finite. Thus\n16\n\n\fthere exists an element L \u2208 k[T1 , . . . , Tn ]/p such that v L is finite. We obi\ntain that Hm\n(BL ) = 0 for all i \u2265 2, since ProjA (B)|D(L) is affine and hence\ni\nH (ProjA (B)|D(L) , OProjA (B) |D(L) ) = 0 for all i \u2265 1 (see [14], III.3), and it foli\nlows that, for all i \u2265 2, Hm\n(B)0 has Hilbert polynomial of degree less than or\nequal to \u03b4 \u2212 1. This and (10) show that (9) reduces to the equality\ndimk (A\u03bd(d) ) \u2212 dimk H 0 (X, OX /(I \u03bd )\u266f ) = dimk \u0393(ProjA (B), OProjA (B) )\u03bd ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhich is true for all \u03bd \u226b 0.\nConsider now the generic point s of the image S = V (p# ) \u2282 Pkn\u22121 of v, and\ndenote by Y the fibred product\nY := BlPn\u22121 \u00d7Pn\u22121 Spec(OPn\u22121 ,s ) = BlI \u00d7S Spec(OS,s ).\nk\n\nk\n\nk\n\nWe\u0010 claim that,\n\u0011 if the map \u03bb is generically finite, there exists an isomorphism\nk[T1 ,...,Tn ]\nof\n-modules:\np\np\n\n\u0393(ProjA (B), OProjA (B) )p \u2243\n\nk[T1 , . . . , Tn ]\np\n\n!\n\n\u2297OS,s \u0393(Y, OY ).\n\n(12)\n\np\n\nSuppose for the moment that this claim is true. From proposition 2.3 \u03bb is\ngenerically finite if and only if v is. Supposing now that J is prime, this is\nequivalent to say that the scheme Y is the spectrum of a field which is a finite\nextension of the field OS,s ; the degree of \u03bb is then the degree of the extension\n\u0393(Y, OY ) of OS,s . By (12) we deduce that there exists a morphism of N-graded\nk[T1 , . . . , Tn ]/p-modules of finite type\n\u03b3:\n\nk[T1 , . . . , Tn ]\n\u2297OS,s \u0393(Y, OY ) \u2192 \u0393(ProjA (B), OProjA (B) ),\np\n\nwhich becomes an isomorphism by localisation at p. The kernel E and the cokernel F of \u03b3 are hence graded k[T1 , . . . , Tn ]/p-modules of finite type annihilated\nby an homogeneous element of non-zero degree. It follows that dim(E) and\ndim(F ) are strictly lower than dim(A), which equals dim(S) by hypothesis.\nFrom here we may deduce that the Hilbert polynomial of the k[T1 , . . . , Tn ]module \u0393(ProjA (B), OProjA (B) ) is of degree \u03b4 with deg(\u03bb)deg(S)/\u03b4! as leading\ncoefficient, since the source of \u03b3 consists in deg(\u03bb) copies of k[T1 , . . . , Tn ]/p\nwhich has Hilbert polynomial of degree \u03b4 with leading coefficient deg(S)/\u03b4!.\nFrom (11) the first statement of the theorem follows. To complete the proof it\nthus remains to prove the claim (12). Hereafter, for convenience, we will write,\nas usually, k[T] for the polynomial ring k[T1 , . . . , Tn ].\nWe denote by v\u0302 : ProjA (B) \u2192 Ank = Spec(k[T]) the canonical projection,\nwhose closed image is V (p\u223c), which is {1} \u00d7 Gm -equivariant. Recall that, by\n17\n\n\fdefinition,\nBlI := Biproj(B) = (ProjA (B)|(Ank )\u2217 )/{1} \u00d7 Gm ,\nand that the morphism v : BlI \u2192 Pkn\u22121 is obtained from the morphism v\u0302|(Ank )\u2217 :\nProjA (B)|(Ank )\u2217 \u2192 (Ank )\u2217 by passing to the quotient. In fact, as the variables Ti\nare all of degree 1, we have the following commutative diagram\nv\u0302|(Ank )\u2217\n\n\u2732\n\nProjA (B)|(Ank )\u2217\n\n(Ank )\u2217\n\nf\n\n\u03c0\n\u2744\nv \u2732 n\u22121\nPk ,\n\n\u2744\n\nBlI = Biproj(B)\n\nwhere the canonical projections f and \u03c0 are (trivial) Gm -torsors (also called\nprincipal Gm -bundles, see [22]). The ring Bp is naturally Z \u00d7 Z-graded and we\nhave the commutative diagram\n\u2732\n\nProjA (Bp)\n\nProjA (B)\nv\u0302\n\nv\u0302p\n\n\u2744\n\u2744\n\u03b8p\nSpec(k[T]p) \u2732 Spec(k[T])\n\nwhich shows, since \u03b8p is flat, that\n\u0393(ProjA (Bp), OProjA (Bp ) ) \u2243 \u0393(ProjA (B), OProjA (B) )p.\n\n(13)\n\nThe morphism ProjA (Bp) \u2192 ProjA (B)|(Ank )\u2217 is clearly {1} \u00d7 Gm -equivariant,\nand hence, passing to the quotient, we obtain the commutative diagram\nProjA (Bp) \u2732 ProjA (B)|(Ank )\u2217\nf\n\nfp\n\u2744\n\n\u2732\n\nBiproj(Bp)\n\n\u2744\n\nBiproj(B),\n\nwhere both vertical arrows are Gm -torsors. We deduce the isomorphism\nOProjA (Bp ) \u2243 fp\u2217 (Bp(0,0) ## ).\n\n(14)\n\nNow we have ProjA (Bp) = Spec(k[T]p)\u00d7(Ank )\u2217 ProjA (B)|(Ank )\u2217 and Spec(k[T]p) =\n(Ank )\u2217 \u00d7Pn\u22121 Spec(OPn\u22121 ,s ).

By hypothesis the\nscheme Y = BlI \u00d7S Spec(OS,s ) is finite on Spec(OS,s ), it is hence the spectrum\nof a semi-local ring and it follows (by [2], proposition 5, II.5)\nBp(0,0) ## \u2243 OBiproj(Bp ) \u2243 OY .\nBy (14) we deduce OProjA (Bp ) \u2243 fp\u2217 (OBiproj (Bp)). As Bp contains an invertible\nhomogeneous element of non-zero degree with respect to the grading of k[T], fp\nis an affine morphism and we obtain the following isomorphisms of (k[T]/p)pmodules\n\u0393(ProjA (Bp), OProjA (Bp ) ) \u2243 \u0393(Biproj(Bp), fp\u2217 (OProjA (Bp ) ))\n\u2243 \u0393(Y, OY ) \u2297OS,s (k[T]/p)p.\nComparing with (13), this proves the claim (12).\n\n\u2737\n\nApplying this theorem with A = k[X1 , . . . , Xr ] (or equivalently J = (0)), we\ncan compute the degree of the closed image of a generically finite rational map\n\u03bb\n\nPkr\u22121 \u2212\n\u2192 Pkn\u22121\n(X1 : * * * : Xr ) 7\u2192 (f1 : * * * : fn )(X1 : * * * : Xr ),\nif dim(A/(f1 , . . . , fn )) \u2264 1, and moreover decide if this map is generically finite\nby computing dr\u22121 \u2212 e(T, Proj(A)). For instance if we suppose in addition\nr = 3 and n = 4 we recover the well-known formula to compute the degree of\n19\n\n\fa surface of P3k parameterized by 4 homogeneous polynomials of P2k of the same\ndegree and without common factor (see e.g. [8], appendix). This theorem also\nyields a more general formula to compute the degree of the closed image of\na generically finite rational map from an irreducible subvariety X = Proj(A)\nof Pkr\u22121 = Proj(k[X1 , . . . , Xr ]) to Pkn\u22121 with a finite number of base points\n(possibly zero). For instance the closed image of a regular map \u03bb from a curve\nC of P2k to P2k given by homogeneous polynomials of same degree d \u2265 1 (this\nimplies that \u03bb is generically finite by the second point of the theorem) is\nd.deg(C)/deg(\u03bb).\n\n3\n\nBlow-up algebras associated to a rational map\n\nLike at the beginning of the preceding section, we suppose that k is a commutative ring and A is a Z-graded k-algebra. We denote also by \u03c4 : k \u2192 A0\nthe canonical morphism of rings and consider the k-algebra morphism\nh : k[T1 , . . . , Tn ] \u2212\u2192 A\nTi\n\n7\u2192 fi ,\n\nwhere each fi is supposed to be of degree d \u2265 1. We will focus on two blowup algebras associated to the ideal I = (f1 , . . . , fn ) of A, the Rees algebra\nReesA (I) and the symmetric algebra SymA (I), and show their close relation\nwith the ideal ker(h) of k[T1 , . . . , Tn ] we would like to study. We have already\nseen that the Rees algebra of I appears naturally in our situation, and we begin\nto deal with it. Hereafter, for simplicity, we will often denote the sequence\nT1 , . . . , Tn by the bold letter T and for instance write k[T] (resp. A[T]) instead\nof k[T1 , . . . , Tn ] (resp. A[T1 , . . . , Tn ]).\nIntroducing a new indeterminate Z, the Rees algebra of I can be described as\nthe image of the A-algebra morphism\n\u03b2 : A[T1 , . . . , Tn ] \u2212\u2192 A[Z, Z \u22121 ]\nTi 7\u2192 fi Z \u22121 .\n(Note that, compared with the definition (2) of \u03b2, we are switching to Z \u22121\nin order to not overload notations in the sequel.) The kernel of \u03b2 has the\nfollowing simple description that\nker(\u03b2) = (T1 \u2212 f1 Z \u22121 , . . . , Tn \u2212 fn Z \u22121 ) \u2229 A[T].\nThis gives an easy way to compute explicitly ker(\u03b2) since we only need to eliminate the variable Z \u22121 from the ideal (T1 \u2212f1 Z \u22121 , . . . , Tn \u2212fn Z \u22121 ). This descrip20\n\n\ftion also shows how ker(\u03b2) and what is called \"moving hypersurfaces\" in different works dealing with the implicitization problem (see 1.1 and 1.2) are related.\nA moving hypersurface following the parameterization f1 , . . . , fn is a polynomial F \u2208 A[T] homogeneous in the Ti\u2032 s and which satisfies F (f1 , . . . , fn ) = 0.\nThe latter condition implies that F \u2208 (T1 \u2212 f1 , . . . , Tn \u2212 fn ), so moving hypersurfaces following the parameterization are exactly the homogeneous elements\nof (T1 \u2212f1 , . . . , Tn \u2212fn ) \u2229A[T]. But it is easy to check that these homogeneous\nelements generate (T1 \u2212 f1 Z \u22121 , . . . , Tn \u2212 fn Z \u22121 ) \u2229 A[T] = ker(\u03b2) by adding\nthe new variable Z \u22121 . Thus it follows that ker(\u03b2) is generated by the moving\nhypersurfaces following the parameterization.\nWe now turn to a second description of ker(\u03b2) in terms of inertia forms, which\nwill enable us to relate it with the kernel of the map h.\nLemma 3.1 ker(\u03b2) = TF(Z) ((f1 \u2212T1 Z, . . . , fn \u2212Tn Z))\u2229A[T1 , . . . , Tn ] as ideals\nof the ring A[T1 , . . . , Tn ].\nProof. Let us consider the A-algebra morphism\n\u03c6\n\nA[T1 , . . . , Tn , Z] \u2212\n\u2192 A[Z, Z \u22121 ] : Ti 7\u2192 fi Z \u22121 ,\nand the quotient algebra D = A[T, Z]/(f1 \u2212 T1 Z, . . . , fn \u2212 Tn Z). The kernel of\n0\nthe localization morphism D \u2192 DZ is H(Z)\n(D). The A-algebra isomorphism\n\u22121\nDZ \u2192 A[Z, Z ] obtained by sending each Ti to fi /Z makes the following\ndiagram commutative:\nA[T, Z]\n\n\u03c6\u2732\n\nA[Z, Z \u22121 ]\n\u273b\n\n\u2240\n\u2744\n\u2744\n\n\u2732\n\nD\n\nDZ\n\nWe hence deduce that ker(\u03c6) = TF(Z) (f1 \u2212 T1 Z, . . . , fn \u2212 Tn Z). Since ker(\u03b2) =\nker(\u03c6) \u2229 A[T], the lemma follows immediately.\n\u2737\n0\nRemark 3.2 We saw that H(Z)\n(D) = ker(D \u2192 DZ ) and is hence prime\nif A is assumed to be an integral domain. It follows then easily that the ideal\nTF(Z) (f1 \u2212T1 Z, . . . , fn \u2212Tn Z) is also prime since it is isomorphic to the kernel\nof the canonical map A[T, Z] \u2192 DZ .\n\nRecall that h is the map k[T1 , . . . , Tn ] \u2192 A which sends each Ti to fi . If we\ndenote by \u03c4 [T] the canonical polynomial extension\n21\n\n\f\u03c4 [T] : k[T1 , . . . , Tn ] \u2212\u2192 A[T1 , . . . , Tn ]\nTi 7\u2192 Ti ,\nwhich is a k[T]-algebra morphism, we can easily check that\nker(h) = \u03c4 [T]\u22121 ((T1 \u2212 f1 , . . . , Tn \u2212 fn ))\n= {P \u2208 k[T1 , . . . , Tn ] : P (f1 , . . . , fn ) = 0}.\n\n(15)\n\nIf we denote also by \u0398 the composed morphism i\u25e6\u03c4 [T], where i is the canonical\ninclusion A[T1 , . . . , Tn ] \u0592\u2192 A[T1 , . . . , Tn , Z], we have the following description\nof ker(h):\nLemma 3.3 ker(h) = \u0398\u22121 (TF(Z) (f1 \u2212 T1 Z, . . . , fn \u2212 Tn Z)).\nProof. First let P \u2208 k[T] such that \u0398(P ) \u2208 TF(Z) (f1 \u2212 T1 Z, . . . , fn \u2212 Tn Z)),\nthat is there exists N \u2208 N\u2217 such that Z N \u03c4 [T](P ) \u2208 (f1 \u2212 T1 Z, . . . , fn \u2212 Tn Z)\nin A[T, Z]. Specializing Z to 1 we obtain P \u2208 ker(h) by (15).\nNow let P \u2208 ker(h) \u2282 k[T]. As the ideal ker(h) is homogeneous in k[T], we\ncan suppose that P is homogeneous of degree m. In this case we can write\nZ m P (T) = P (ZT1 , . . . , ZTn )\n= P (ZT1 , . . . , ZTn ) \u2212 P (f1 , . . . , fn )\n\u2208 (f1 \u2212 T1 Z, . . . , fn \u2212 Tn Z).\nWe hence deduce that P \u2208 TF(Z) ((f1 \u2212 T1 Z, . . . , fn \u2212 Tn Z)).\n\n\u2737\n\nRemark 3.4 If k \u2282 A0 then we have immediately\nker(h) = TF(Z) (f1 \u2212 T1 Z, . . . , fn \u2212 Tn Z) \u2229 k[T].\nMoreover if we suppose that k = A0 , deg(Ti ) = 0 and deg(Z) = d \u2265 1, then\nwe obtain k[T] = (A[T, Z])0 and so\nker(h) = (TF(Z) (f1 \u2212 T1 Z, . . . , fn \u2212 Tn Z))0 .\nWe are now ready to relate ker(h) and ker(\u03b2).\nProposition 3.5 Suppose that k \u2282 A0 , then\nker(h) = ker(\u03b2) \u2229 k[T] = TF(Z) (f1 \u2212 T1 Z, . . . , fn \u2212 Tn Z)) \u2229 k[T].\nMoreover, if J is an ideal of A such that HJ0 (A) = 0, then we have ker(\u03b2) =\n22\n\n\fTFJ (ker(\u03b2)) and hence\nker(h) = ker(\u03b2) \u2229 k[T] = TFJ (ker(\u03b2)) \u2229 k[T].\nProof. By lemma 3.1 and remark 3.4 the first claim is proved. To prove the\nsecond part of this lemma we consider the A-algebra\nD = A[T, Z]/(f1 \u2212 T1 Z, . . . , fn \u2212 Tn Z).\nThis yields an isomorphism of A-algebras, that we have already used in lemma\n\u223c\n3.1, DZ \u2212\n\u2192 A[Z, Z \u22121 ] obtained by sending each Ti to fi /Z. Now suppose that\nJ is an ideal of A such that HJ0 (A) = 0, then HJ0 (DZ ) = HJ0 (A)[Z, Z \u22121 ] = 0.\n0\nThis implies that HJ0 (D) \u2282 H(Z)\n(D), from we deduce\nTFJ ((f1 \u2212 T1 Z, . . . , fn \u2212 Tn Z)) \u2282 TF(Z) ((f1 \u2212 T1 Z, . . . , fn \u2212 Tn Z)).\nNow it comes easily\nTF(Z) ((f1 \u2212 T1 Z, . . . , fn \u2212 Tn Z)) = TF(Z) TFJ ((f1 \u2212 T1 Z, . . . , fn \u2212 Tn Z))\n= TFJ TF(Z) ((f1 \u2212 T1 Z, . . . , fn \u2212 Tn Z)),\n\nand intersecting with A[T] we obtain ker(\u03b2) = TFJ (ker(\u03b2)).\n\n\u2737\n\nThis result shows the close relation between ker(h) and ker(\u03b2). In fact, as\nwe have already mentionned, a lot of information about the closed image of\n\u03bb is contained in the kernel of \u03b2 (which can be obtained by Gr\u00f6bner basis\ncomputations for instance). However ker(\u03b2) is difficult to study in general,\nand we prefer to work with an \"approximation\" of it which involves the study\nof the symmetric algebra of I that we now describe.\nClassically, we have the well known canonical surjective morphism of A-algebras\n\u03b1 : A[T1 , . . . , Tn ] \u2212\u2192 SymA (I)\nTi 7\u2192 fi ,\nwhose kernel is described by\nker(\u03b1) = {T1 g1 + . . . + Tn gn : gi \u2208 A[T],\n\nn\nX\n\nfi gi = 0}.\n\ni=1\n\nNote here that ker(\u03b1) is generated by the moving hyperplanes (i.e. moving\nhypersurfaces of degree 1) following the parameterization f1 , . . . , fn . The symmetric algebra of I appears naturally by its link with the Rees algebra of I\n23\n\n\f(see for instance [25]). We have the following commutative diagram\nker(\u03b2) \u271b\n\n\u2283\n\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2758\n\u2745\n\nker(\u03b1)\n\n\u2720\n\nA[T1 , . . . , Tn ]\n\u03b1\n\u2720\n\nSymA (I)\n\n\u03c3\n\n\u2745\n\u2745 \u03b2\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2758\n\u2732 ReesA (I)\n\nwhere \u03c3 denotes the canonical map from SymA (I) to ReesA (I). In fact the\nquotient ker(\u03b2)/ker(\u03b1) has been widely studied as it gives a measure of the\ndifficulty in examining the Rees algebra of I. We recall that the ideal I is said\nto be of linear type if the canonical map \u03c3 is an isomorphism. The following\nproposition can be summarizes by \"the ideal ker(\u03b1) is as an approximation of\nthe ideal ker(\u03b2)\".\nProposition 3.6 Let J be an ideal of A such that the ideal I is of linear type\noutside V (J) then\nTFJ (ker(\u03b1)) = TFJ (ker(\u03b2)).\nIf moreover HJ0 (A) = 0 then\nker(\u03b2) = TFJ (ker(\u03b1)).\nProof. The first assertion comes by definition: if I is of linear type outside\nV (J) then the A[T]-module ker(\u03b2)/ker(\u03b1) is supported in V (J), that is\nJ.A[T] \u2282\n\nq\n\nJ.A[T] \u2282\n\nq\n\nannA[T] (ker(\u03b2)/ker(\u03b1)),\n\nwhich implies TFJ (ker(\u03b1)) = TFJ (ker(\u03b2)). The second statement is a consequence of the first one and proposition 3.5.\n\u2737\nRemark 3.7 We will see later, as a particular case, that if the first homology\ngroup of the Koszul complex associated to the sequence f1 , . . . , fn is zero outside\nV (J), then I is of linear type outside V (J).\nIn view of propositions 3.6 and 3.5, we end this section with the following\ncorollary which summarizes the relations between ker(h), ker(\u03b2) and ker(\u03b1):\nCorollary 3.8 Suppose that k \u2282 A0 . If J is an ideal of A such that HJ0 (A) = 0\n24\n\n\fand I is of linear type outside V (J), then\nker(h) = ker(\u03b2) \u2229 k[T] = TFJ (ker(\u03b2)) \u2229 k[T] = TFJ (ker(\u03b1)) \u2229 k[T].\n\n4\n\nApproximation complexes\n\nIn the first part of this section we give the definition and some basic properties\nof the approximation complexes. These complexes was introduced in [24] and\nsystematically developed in [15] and [16]. At their most typical, they are projective resolutions of the symmetric algebras of ideals and allow an in-depth\nstudy of the canonical morphism \u03c3 : SymA (I) \u2192 ReesA (I). In what follows we\nonly develop (sometimes without proof) those properties that directly affect\nthe applications we are interested in. For a complete treatment on the subject\nwe refer the reader to the previously cited articles. In the second part of this\nsection we prove two new acyclicity lemmas about the approximation complexes that we will use later to deal with the implicitization problem. Finally,\nwe end this section with a problem introduced by David Cox in the study of\nthe method of \"moving surfaces\", and called Koszul syzygies (see [9]).\n\n4.1 Definition and basic properties\nLet A be a commutative ring and J be an ideal of A generated by r elements\na1 , . . . , ar (which we will often denote by the bold letter a). Both applications\nr (a1 ,...,ar )\n\nu : A[T1 , . . . , Tr ] \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 A[T1 , . . . , Tr ] : (b1 , . . . , br ) 7\u2192\n\nr\nX\n\nbi ai ,\n\nr\nX\n\nbi Ti ,\n\ni=1\n\nr (T1 ,...,Tr )\n\nv : A[T1 , . . . , Tr ] \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 A[T1 , . . . , Tr ] : (b1 , . . . , br ) 7\u2192\n\ni=1\n\ngive two Koszul complexes K(a; A[T]) and K(T; A[T]) with respective differentials da and dT . One can check easily that these differentials satisfy the\nproperty da \u25e6 dT + dT \u25e6 da = 0, and hence there exists three complexes, the\nso-called approximation complexes, which we denote\nZ\u2022 = (ker da , dT )\nB\u2022 = (Im da , dT )\nM\u2022 = (H\u2022 (K(a; A[T])), dT ).\nv\n\nThe Z-complex ends with the sequence ker(u) \u2212\n\u2192 A[T1 , . . . , Tr ] \u2192 0.

More generally one\ncan check that v(ker(u)) annihilates the homology A[T]-modules of Z, B and\nM which are hence modules over SymA (J). These homology modules have\nalso a nice property, which is probably one of the most important of the\napproximation complexes:\nProposition 4.1 The homology modules of Z, B and M do not depend on\nthe generating set chosen for the ideal J.\nProof. See proposition 3.2.6 and corollary 3.2.7 of [25].\n\n\u2737\n\nSome other nice properties of the approximation complexes are due to the\nexactness of the standard Koszul complex L = K(T; A[T]). By definition we\nhave the exact sequence of complexes\nd\n\na\nB[\u22121] \u2192 0,\n0 \u2192 Z \u0592\u2192 L \u2212\u2192\n\n(16)\n\nwhere B[\u22121] denotes the translate of B such that B[\u22121]n = Bn\u22121 . Moreover,\nsetting deg(Ti ) = 1 for all i, the complexes L, Z and B (and also M) are\ngraded and give for all t \u2208 N an exact sequence\nd\n\na\n(B[\u22121])t\u22121 \u2192 0,\n0 \u2192 (Z)t \u0592\u2192 (L)t \u2212\u2192\n\nwhere (L)t , (Z)t and (B)t are the part of degree t of the complexes L, Z and\nB. For instance (L)t is the complex of A-modules\nd\n\nd\n\nd\n\nT\nT\nT\n0 \u2192 A[T]t\u2212r \u2212\u2192\n. . . \u2212\u2192\nA[T]rt\u22121 \u2212\u2192\nA[T]t \u2192 0.\n\nNow from the exactness of L in positive degrees and the long exact sequence\nassociated to (16) we deduce, for all i \u2265 1, an isomorphism of graded modules\n\u223c\nHi (B) \u2212\n\u2192 Hi (Z)(1), where Hi (Z)(1) denotes the graded module Hi (Z) with\ndegree shifted by 1 (i.e. Hi (Z)(1)t = Hi (Z)t+1 ). For the case i = 0 the long\nexact sequence ends with\n\u03c0\n\nH1 (L) = 0 \u2192 H0 (B) \u2192 H0 (Z) \u2212\n\u2192 H0 (L) \u2192 0,\nhence H0 (B) \u2243 ker(\u03c0). Since H0 (L)i = 0 if i > 0 and is A if i = 0, we deduce\nProposition 4.2 If for all i \u2265 0 we define the graded modules H\u0303i (Z) by\nH\u0303i (Z)t = Hi (Z)t for all i \u2265 1 and all t, H\u03030 (Z)t = H0 (Z)t if t 6= 0 and\n26\n\n\fH\u03030 (Z)0 = 0, then we have an isomorphism of graded modules\n\u223c\n\nHi (B) \u2212\n\u2192 H\u0303i (Z)(1) for all i \u2265 0.\nWe have another natural exact sequence of complexes involving the complex\nM:\n0 \u2192 B \u2192 Z \u2192 M \u2192 0.\n(17)\nProposition 4.2 and the long exact sequence associated to (17) give the following graded long exact sequence:\n\n. . . \u2192 H\u0303i (Z)(1) \u2192 Hi (Z) \u2192 Hi (M) \u2192 H\u0303i\u22121 (Z)(1) \u2192 . . .\n. . . \u2192 H\u03030 (Z)(1) \u2192 H0 (Z) \u2192 H0 (M) \u2192 0.\n\n(18)\n\nThis sequence yields two results on these approximation complexes. The first\none is contained in the following proposition.\nProposition 4.3 Suppose that A is a noetherian ring and i \u2265 1. If Hi (M) =\n0 then Hi (Z) = 0. In particular, if M is acyclic then Z is also acyclic.\nProof. From the long exact sequence (18) we have, for all i \u2265 1, the exact\nsequence\nH\u0303i (Z)(1) \u2192 Hi (Z) \u2192 Hi (M).\nBy hypothesis Hi (M) = 0, and since i \u2265 1, we deduce a surjective morphism\nof A[T]-modules Hi (Z)(1) \u2192 Hi (Z). Now A is noetherian, so A[T] is also and\nwe deduce that Hi (Z) is a A[T]-module of finite type. This implies that our\nsurjective morphism is in fact bijective. Taking into account the degrees we\n\u223c\nobtain isomorphisms Hi (Z)t+1 \u2212\n\u2192 Hi (Z)t for all t. As Hi (Z)\u22121 = 0 we deduce\nby iteration that Hi (Z)t = 0 for all t.\n\u2737\nRemark 4.4 Notice that, by definition of M, if Hi (K(a; A[T])) = 0 then\nHi (M) = 0.\nThe second result given by (18) is a condition so that the canonical morphism\n\u03c3 : SymA (J) \u2192 ReesA (J) becomes an isomorphism: in this case we say that\nJ is of linear type. By definition we have\nH\u03030 (Z)(1) = \u2295t\u22651 H0 (Z)t = \u2295t\u22651 SymtA (J) = Sym+\nA (J),\nand hence, examining the end of (18), we obtain the exact sequence\n\u03bc\n\nH1 (M) \u2192 Sym+\n\u2192 SymA (J) \u2192 SymA/J (J/J 2 ) \u2192 0.\nA (J) \u2212\n27\n\n\fThe map \u03bc is called the downgrading map (see [25], chap. 3), it is induced by\nthe morphism\nTAn (J) \u2192 TAn\u22121 (J) : x1 \u2297 . . . \u2297 xn 7\u2192 x1 x2 \u2297 x3 \u2297 . . . \u2297 xn ,\nwhere TAn (J) denotes the degree n part of the tensor algebra associated to J\ni\nover A. Denoting grJ (A) := \u2295i\u22650 J i /J i+1 and Rees+\nA (J) := \u2295i\u22651 J , we obtain\nthe commutative diagram\nH1 (M)\n\n\u2732\n\n\u03bc\u2732\n\u03c0\nSym+\nSymA (J) \u2732 SymA/J (J/J 2 )\nA (J)\n\u03c3\n\n0\n\n\u2732\n\n\u2744\n\n\u2744\n\n\u2732 ReesA (J)\nRees+\nA (J)\n\n\u2732\n\n0\n\n\u2732\n\n0,\n\n\u03b3\n\u2732\n\n\u2744\n\ngrJ (A)\n\nwhich gives the following proposition.\nProposition 4.5 If H1 (M) = 0 then SymA (J) \u2243 ReesA (J), that is J is of\nlinear type.\nProof.

As \u03c31 is already\nsurjective it is an isomorphism. By iteration we show that \u03c3t is an isomorphism for all t \u2208 N, and hence that SymA (J) \u2243 ReesA (J).\n\u2737\nThis result gives a criterion for an ideal to be of linear type, that is \u03c3 is an\nisomorphism. If the ring A is noetherian one can show that \u03c3 is an isomorphism\nif and only if \u03b3 is (see [25], theorem 2.2.1). There also exists other criterions\nfor an ideal to be of linear type based on some properties of a set of generators\nof J (see [25], paragraph 3.3) but we will not go further in this direction here.\n4.2 Acyclicity criteria\nWe will here prove two acyclicity results that we will apply later to the implicitization problem. We first recall the acyclicity criterion of Peskine-Szpiro:\n28\n\n\fLemma 4.6 (Acyclicity lemma) Suppose that R is a commutative noetherian\nring, I a proper ideal, and\nC\u2022 : 0 \u2192 Mn \u2192 Mn\u22121 \u2192 . . . \u2192 M0\na complex of finitely generated R-modules with homology Hk = Hk (C\u2022 ) such\nthat each non-zero module Hk , for all k = 1, . . . , n, satisfies depthI (Hk ) = 0.\nThen depthI (Mk ) \u2265 k for all k = 1, . . . , n implies C\u2022 is exact.\nProof. We refer to [4], lemma 3.\n\n\u2737\n\nHereafter we assume that A is a noetherian commutative N-graded ring, and\nwe denote by m its ideal generated by elements of strictly positive degree, that\nis m = A+ = \u2295\u03bd>0 A\u03bd . The following proposition is our first acyclicity result.\nProposition 4.7 Let I = (a1 , . . . , an ) be an ideal of A such that both ideals\nI and m have the same radical, and suppose that \u03c3 = depthm(A) \u2265 1. Then\nthe homology modules Hi (Z) vanish for i \u2265 max(1, n \u2212 \u03c3), where Z denotes\nthe Z-complex associated to the ideal I.\nIn particular if n \u2265 2 and \u03c3 = depthm(A) \u2265 n \u2212 1 then the complex Z is\nacyclic.\nProof. This proof is based on chasing depths and the acyclicity lemma 4.6. Let\nK\u2022 (a; A) be the Koszul complex associated to the sequence a1 , . . . , an in A.\nWe denote by Hi (a; A) its homology modules and by Zi (resp. Bi ) the i-cycles\n(resp. the i-boundaries) of K\u2022 (a; A). The Z-complex is of the form\n0 \u2192 Zn\u22121 \u2192 Zn\u22122 \u2192 . . . \u2192 Z1 \u2192 Z0 \u2192 0.\nSince I and m have the same radical the homology modules Hi (a; A) are\nsupported on V (m) for I annihilates them. Hence, by proposition 4.3 and\nremark 4.4, homology modules Hi (Z) are supported on V (m) for all i \u2265 1,\nand consequently we have\ndepthm(Hi (Z)) = 0 for all Hi (Z) 6= 0, i \u2265 1.\n\n(19)\n\nAlways since I and m have the same radical we have \u03c3 = depthm(A) =\ndepthI (A) and hence deduce by lemma 4.6 that Hi (a; A) = 0 for i > n \u2212 \u03c3. It\nfollows that the following truncated Koszul complex is exact:\n0 \u2192 Kn \u2192 Kn\u22121 \u2192 . . . \u2192 Kn\u2212\u03c3+1 \u2192 Kn\u2212\u03c3 ,\nand, since \u03c3 \u2265 1, we have exact sequences\n29\n\n\f0 \u2192 Kn \u2192 Bn\u22121 \u2192 0,\n0 \u2192 Bn\u22121 \u2192 Kn\u22121 \u2192 Bn\u22122 \u2192 0,\n..\n..\n.\n.\n0 \u2192 Bn\u2212\u03c3+1 \u2192 Kn\u2212\u03c3+1 \u2192 Bn\u2212\u03c3 \u2192 0.\nWe can now use standard properties of depth (see [11] corollary 18.6). As\ndepthm(Ki ) \u2265 \u03c3 for all i, it follows by iterations that depthm(Bi ) \u2265 \u03c3 \u2212 (n \u2212\ni) + 1 for i from n \u2212 \u03c3 to n \u2212 1. Since \u03c3 \u2265 1 we have Zn = 0 and Zi = Bi\nfor n \u2212 1 \u2265 i > n \u2212 \u03c3. Moreover Zn\u2212\u03c3 \u2282 Kn\u2212\u03c3 and depthm(Kn\u2212\u03c3 ) \u2265 1 hence\ndepthm(Zn\u2212\u03c3 ) \u2265 1. We finally obtain, using the fact that Zi = Zi [T] for all\ni = 0, . . . , n,\nZn = 0 and depthm(Zi ) \u2265 i \u2212 (n \u2212 \u03c3 \u2212 1) for n > i \u2265 n \u2212 \u03c3.\n\n(20)\n\nBy lemma 4.6, (19) and (20) show that the complex\n0 \u2192 Zn\u22121 \u2192 . . . \u2192 Zn\u2212\u03c3+1 \u2192 Zn\u2212\u03c3\u22121\nis exact, i.e. Hi (Z) = 0 for i \u2265 max(1, n \u2212 \u03c3).\n\n\u2737\n\nThe preceding result is valid only if both ideals I and m have the same radical.\nConsequently, when we will apply this result to the implicitization problem, it\nwill be useful only in the absence of base points. In order to deal with certain\ncases where there exists base points we prove a second acyclicity lemma.\nFor any ideal J of a ring R we denote by \u03bc(J) the minimal number of generators of J. We recall the standard definition of a projective local complete\nintersection ideal.\nDefinition 4.8 Let I be an ideal of A. I is said to be a local complete intersection in Proj(A) if and only if for all p \u2208 Spec(A) \\ V (m) we have\n\u03bc(Ip) = depthIp (Ap).\nProposition 4.9 Let I = (a1 , . . . , an ) be an ideal of A such that I is a local\ncomplete intersection in Proj(A) and n \u2265 2. Suppose depthm(A) \u2265 n \u2212 1 and\ndepthI (A) = n \u2212 2, then the Z-complex associated to I is acyclic.\nProof. Notice first that, since depthI (A) = n \u2212 2, the minimal number of\ngenerators of I is at least n \u2212 2. If \u03bc(I) = n \u2212 2 then by proposition 4.1\nwe obtain immediately that M is acyclic and so Z, since I is a complete\nintersection ideal. Consequently we suppose that \u03bc(I) \u2265 n \u2212 1. The proof is\nnow very similar to the one of proposition 4.7 and is also based on chasing\ndepths and the acyclicity lemma 4.6. We keep the notation of proposition\n4.7, that is K\u2022 (a; A) denotes the Koszul complex associated to the sequence\na1 , . . . , an in A, for all i \u2265 0 Hi (a; A) denote its homology modules and Zi\n30\n\n\f(resp. Bi ) its i-cycles (resp. its i-boundaries). The Z-complex is of the form\n0 \u2192 Zn\u22121 \u2192 Zn\u22122 \u2192 . . . \u2192 Z1 \u2192 Z0 \u2192 0.\nSince I is a local complete intersection in Proj(A), proposition 4.1 shows that\nthe homology modules Hi (M) for all i \u2265 1 are supported on V (m), where\nM is the approximation complex associated to the homology of the ideal I.\nNow by proposition 4.3 it follows that the homology modules Hi (Z) are also\nsupported on V (m) for all i \u2265 1, and consequently we have\ndepthm(Hi (Z)) = 0 for all Hi (Z) 6= 0, i \u2265 1.\n\n(21)\n\nSince we have supposed depthI (A) = n \u2212 2, the homology modules Hi (a; A)\nvanish for i > 2. The following truncated Koszul complex is hence exact:\n0 \u2192 Kn \u2192 Kn\u22121 \u2192 . . . \u2192 K3 \u2192 K2 ,\nand we have exact sequences\n0 \u2192 Kn \u2192 Bn\u22121 \u2192 0,\n0 \u2192 Bn\u22121 \u2192 Kn\u22121 \u2192 Bn\u22122 \u2192 0,\n..\n..\n.\n.\n0 \u2192 B3 \u2192 K3 \u2192 B2 \u2192 0.\nAs depthm(Ki ) \u2265 n \u2212 1 for all i = 1, . . . , n, it follows by iterations that\ndepthm(Bi ) \u2265 i for i from 2 to n \u2212 1. But we have Zn = 0 and Zi = Bi for\nn \u2212 1 \u2265 i > 2, so depthm(Zi ) \u2265 i for n \u2212 1 \u2265 i \u2265 3. We have also Z1 \u2282 K1\nand depth(K1 ) \u2265 1, so we deduce depthm(Z1 ) \u2265 1.\nNow since Zi = Zi [T] we obtain\nZn = 0 and depthm(Zi ) \u2265 i for i \u2265 3 and i = 1.\n\n(22)\n\nIf we prove that depth(Z2 ) \u2265 2, (21) and (22) imply that the Z-complex associated to I is exact by lemma 4.6. To show this last inequality we prove that\nin both cases \u03bc(I) = n \u2212 1 and \u03bc(I) = n we have H2 (M) = 0. For this we\nneed the two lemmas stated just after this proposition. If \u03bc(I) = n \u2212 1, lemma\n4.11 implies immediately H2 (M) = 0. If \u03bc(I) = n lemma 4.11 implies that\n0\n0\nH2 (M) = Hm\n(H2 (M)), and by lemma 4.10 we obtain that Hm\n(H2 (M)) = 0,\nso H2 (M) = 0. It follows that in both cases B2 = Z2 , and since we have proved\ndepthm(B2 ) \u2265 2, we deduce depthm(B2 ) \u2265 2, and finally depthm(Z2 ) \u2265 2. \u2737\nLemma 4.10 Let I = (a1 , . . . , an ) be an ideal of A such that depthm(A) >\n0\ndepthI (A), then Hm\n(Hn\u2212depthI (A) (a; A)) = 0.\n31\n\n\fProof.

This lemma is a direct consequence of the proposition 4.1. Indeed, for\nthe first statement, we can construct the complex M from the Koszul complex\nof a sequence of elements a\u20321 , . . . , a\u2032\u03bc(I) which generate I. This Koszul complex\nhas all its homology groups Hp (a\u2032 ; A) = 0 for p > \u03bc(I)\u2212depthI (A), and we deduce, by definition of M, that Hp (M) = 0 for such p. Now for all p \u2208 Spec(A)\nand all i \u2265 0 we have Hi (M(I))p \u2243 Hi (M(I)p) \u2243 Hi (M(Ip)), where the last\nisomorphism is true by proposition 4.1. From the first statement of this lemma\nwe deduce that H\u03b6 (M(Ip)) = 0 for all p \u2208\n/ V (m), since \u03b6 > \u03b6p. It follows that\n0\nH\u03b6 (M)p = 0 for all p \u2208\n/ V (m), which implies H\u03b6 (M) = Hm\n(H\u03b6 (M)).\n\u2737\n\n32\n\n\f4.3 Syzygetic ideals and Koszul syzygies\n\nWe will now investigate a problem introduced by David Cox, always in relation\nwith the implicitization problem, and solved by himself and Hal Schenck in\n[9], theorem 1.7, in P2 . Being given a homogeneous ideal I = (a1 , a2 , a3 ) of\nP2 of codimension two, the authors showed that the module of syzygies of\nI vanishing at the scheme locus V (I) is generated by the Koszul sygyzies\nif and only if V (I) is a local complete intersection in P2 . In other words,\nif Z1 (resp. B1 ) denotes the first syzygies (resp. the first boundaries) of the\nKoszul complex associated to the sequence a1 , a2 , a3 , they showed that Z1 \u2229\nTFm(I).An = B1 if and only if I is a local complete intersection in P2 , where\nm is the irrelevant ideal of the ring A = k[X1 , X2 , X3 ] defining P2 . This result\nis interesting in at least two points: the first one is that it gives an algorithmic\nway to test if the ideal I is a local complete intersection of P2 or not, and\nthe second is that it is the key point of a new formula for the implicitization\nproblem (see e.g. [7]).\nIn what follows we show that this problem is closely related to syzygetic\nideals and generalize the preceding result. Let A be a N-graded commutative\nnoetherian ring, m = \u2295\u03bd>0 A\u03bd be its irrelevant ideal, and let I be another\nideal of A generated by n elements, say a1 , . . . , an . We denote by Z1 (resp. B1 )\nthe first syzygies (resp. the first boundaries) of the Koszul complex over A\nassociated to sequence a1 , . . . , an . Our aim is to formulate a necessary and\nsufficient condition so that the inclusion\nB1 \u2282 Z1 \u2229 TFm(I).An\nbecomes an equality (notice that we always have B1 \u2282 Z1 \u2229 I.An and also\nZ1 \u2229 I.An \u2282 Z1 \u2229 TFm(I).An ).\nWe have an exact sequence of A-modules:\n0 \u2192 B1 \u0592\u2192 I.An \u2192 Sym2A (I) \u2192 0,\nwhere the last map sends (x1 , . . . , xn ) \u2208 I.An to the equivalence class of (x1 \u2297\na1 + . . . + xn \u2297 an ) in Sym2A (I). We have the other exact sequence\n0 \u2192 Z1 \u2229 I.An \u2192 I.An \u2192 I 2 \u2192 0,\nwhere the last map sends (x1 , . . . , xn ) \u2208 I.An to x1 a1 +. . .+xn an \u2208 I 2 . Putting\nthese two exact sequences together we obtain the following commutative dia33\n\n\fgram\n\u2732\n\n0\n\nB1\n\n\u2732\n\nI.An\n\n\u2732\n\nSym2A (I)\n\n\u2732\n\n0\n\n\u2732\n\n0,\n\n\u2229\n\n\u2240\n0\n\n\u2732\n\n\u2744\n\nZ1 \u2229 I.An\n\n\u2732\n\n\u2744\n\nI.An\n\n\u2732\n\n\u2744\n\u2744\n\nI2\n\nwhere the vertical maps are the canonical ones. From the snake lemma we\ndeduce immediately the isomorphism\nZ1 \u2229 I.An\n\u2243 ker(Sym2A (I) \u2192 I 2 ).\nB1\nFollowing [24], we denote ker(Sym2A (I) \u2192 I 2 ) by \u03b4(I) (even if it is not the real\ndefinition of this invariant of I but a property) and will say that I is syzygetic\nif \u03b4(I) = 0. We just proved:\nLemma 4.12 B1 = Z1 \u2229 I.An if and only if I is syzygetic.\nWe state now the main result of this paragraph.\nTheorem 4.13 If depthm(A) > depthI (A) = n \u2212 1 then the following statements are equivalent:\na) B1 = Z1 \u2229 I.An\nb) B1 = Z1 \u2229 TFm(I).An .\nc) I is syzygetic.\nProof. We have already prove that a) is equivalent to c), and as\nB1 \u2282 Z1 \u2229 I.An \u2282 Z1 \u2229 TFm(I).An ,\nit remains only to show that a) implies b).\nLet (x1 , . . . , xn ) \u2208 Z1 \u2229TFm(I).An . By definition there exists an integer \u03bd such\nthat\nm\u03bd (x1 , . . . , xn ) \u2282 Z1 \u2229 I.An = B1 .\nThis last implies that for all \u03be \u2208 m the equivalence class of \u03be \u03bd .(x1 , . . . , xn )\n0\nin H1 (a, A) is 0. But by lemma 4.10 we have Hm\n(H1 (a, A)) = 0, and we\ndeduce that the equivalence class of (x1 , . . . , xn ) in H1 (a, A) is 0, that is\n(x1 , . . . , xn ) \u2208 B1 .\n\u2737\nWe now give a more explicit condition on the ideal I to obtain the desired property B1 = Z1 \u2229TFm(I).An . For this we consider the approximation complex M\n34\n\n\fattached to the ideal I. From now we suppose that A = k[X1 , . . . , Xn ] with k a\nnoetherian commutative ring, I = (a1 , . . . , an ), and we take m = (X1 , . . . , Xn )\n(in this case we have depthm(A) = n).\nProposition 4.14 Suppose k is a Cohen-Macaulay ring. If I is a local complete intersection in Pkn\u22121 and codim(I) = n \u2212 1, then B1 = Z1 \u2229 TFm(I).An .\nProof. Since depthI (A) = n \u2212 1, we have only to prove that I is syzygetic\nby theorem 4.13. Now lemma 4.11 shows that H1 (M) = 0 in both cases\n\u03bc(I) = n \u2212 1 and \u03bc(I) = n: if \u03bc(I) = n \u2212 1 we have directly H1 (M) = 0 by\n0\na) and, if \u03bc(I) = n, b) implies H1 (M) = Hm\n(H1 (M)) and lemma 4.10 shows\nthat this last is zero. By proposition 4.5 it follows that I is of linear type,\nwhich implies that I is syzygetic.\n\u2737\nIn the case n = 3 the preceding proposition becomes an equivalence, due to a\nparticular property of \u03b4(I) which is stated in theorem 2.2 of [24]. The following\nproposition generalizes the theorem 1.7 of [9], where k is a field, to the case k\nis a noetherian regular ring.\nProposition 4.15 Suppose k is a regular ring, n = 3 and codim(I) = 2. Then\nI is a local complete intersection in P2k if and only if B1 = Z1 \u2229 TFm(I).A3 .\nProof. The only point we have to prove is that, under our hypothesis, if I is\nsyzygetic then I is a local complete intersection in P2k . For this we will use\ntheorem 2.2 of [24]: let R be a noetherian local ring of depth two and let P an\nideal of codimension two and projective dimension one, then P is generated\nby a regular sequence if and only if \u03b4(P ) = 0.\nClearly Ip \u2243 TFm(I)p for all p \u2208\n/ V (m). As the invariant \u03b4(I) of I satisfies\n\u03b4(I)p \u2243 \u03b4(Ip) for all p \u2208 Spec(A), if we prove that T Fm(I) has projective\ndimension 1 then theorem 2.2 of [24] implies that TFm(I) is a local complete\nintersection in P2k , which is equivalent to say that I is.\nFrom the definition of TFm(I), it follows that m is not associated to TFm(I)\n(it is easy to see that TFm(I) : m = TFm(I)) and hence\ndepthm(A/TFm(I)) > 0.\nBut we know that depthm(A/TFm(I)) \u2264 dim(A/TFm(I)), and we know also\nthat dim(A/TFm(I)) = dim(A) \u2212 codim(TFm(I)) = 1. We deduce\ndim(A/TFm(I)) \u2212 depthm(A/TFm(I)) = 0.\nNow, since k is assumed to be regular, the Auslander-Buchsbaum formula\ngives\npd(A/TFm(I)) = depthm(A) \u2212 depthm(A/TFm(I)).\n35\n\n\fAs depthm(A) = dim(A) = dim(A/TFm(I)) + codim(TFm(I)) we deduce\npd(A/TFm(I)) = codim(TFm(I)) = 2, whence pd(TFm(I)) = 1.\n\u2737\n\n5\n\nThe implicitization problem via the approximation complexes\n\nAs we have seen, the kernel of the map h : k[T] \u2192 A which sends Ti to fi \u2208 Ad\nfor i = 1, . . . , n, defines the closed image of its associated map \u03bb (1). In this\nsection we will investigate the so-called implicitization problem. Hereafter we\nsuppose that k is a field and that A is the polynomial ring k[X1 , . . . , Xn\u22121 ],\nwith n \u2265 3, whose irrelevant ideal is denoted m = (X1 , . . . , Xn\u22121 ) \u2282 A. If the\nmorphism \u03bb is generically finite then the closed image of \u03bb is a hypersurface\nof Pkn\u22121 , and the implicitization problem consists in computing explicitly its\nequation (up to a nonzero multiple in k). In what follows we will apply techniques using the approximation complexes we have introduced in section 4.\nWe will denote by I the ideal of A generated by the polynomials f1 , . . . , fn\nwhich are supposed to be of the same degree d \u2265 1, considering each Xi of\ndegree 1 in A. We will also denote by Z and M the two approximation complexes associated to I. The basic idea is to show that the Z-complex is acyclic\nunder certain conditions, giving thus a resolution of the symmetric algebra\nSymA (I), and then obtain the implicit equation as the determinant of some\nof its homogeneous components. Before going further into different particular\ncases we give the main ingredient of this section.\nThe symmetric algebra of I is naturally bi-graded by the exact sequence:\n\u03b1\n\n0 \u2192 ker(\u03b1) \u2192 A[T1 , . . . , Tn ] \u2212\n\u2192 SymA (I) \u2192 0,\nwhere ker(\u03b1) = ( bi Ti | bi \u2208 A\nbi fi = 0) \u2282 A[T1 , . . . , Tn ]. We denote by\nSymA (I)\u03bd the graded part of SymA (I) corresponding to the grading of A, that\nis, to be more precise, SymA (I)\u03bd = \u2295l\u22650 A\u03bd SymlA (I).\nP\n\nP\n\nProposition 5.1 Suppose that I is of linear type outside V (m), and let \u03b7 be\n0\nan integer such that Hm\n(SymA (I))\u03bd = 0 for all \u03bd \u2265 \u03b7 then\nannk[T] (SymA (I)\u03bd ) = ker(h) for all \u03bd \u2265 \u03b7.\nProof. By definition, for \u03bd \u2208 N,\nannk[T] (SymA (I)\u03bd ) = {f \u2208 k[T] : f.SymA (I)\u03bd = 0},\nand from the description of SymA (I) we deduce\nannk[T] (SymA (I)\u03bd ) = {f \u2208 k[T] : f.A\u03bd [T] \u2282 ker(\u03b1)}.\n36\n\n(23)\n\n\f0\nIn the same way, Hm\n(SymA (I))\u03bd = 0 is equivalent to\n\n{f \u2208 A\u03bd [T] : \u2203n mn f \u2282 ker(\u03b1)} = ker(\u03b1)\u03bd .\n\n(24)\n\nFrom (23) and (24) we easily check that\nannk[T](SymA (I)\u03bd ) = {f \u2208 k[T] : f.A\u03b7 [T] \u2282 ker(\u03b1)}\n= {f \u2208 k[T] : f.A\u2265\u03b7 [T] \u2282 ker(\u03b1)},\n\n(25)\n\nfor all \u03bd \u2265 \u03b7.\n0\nNow since I is of linear type outside V (m) and Hm\n(A) = 0, corollary 3.8 implies\nthat ker(h) is exactly TFm(ker(\u03b1)) \u2229 k[T] (observe here that TFm = TFm[T] ),\nand we have\n\nker(h) = {f \u2208 k[T] : \u2203n mn .f \u2282 ker(\u03b1)}\n= {f \u2208 k[T] : \u2203n f.A\u2265n [T] \u2282 ker(\u03b1)}.\nNow it is easy to check that (25) and (26) are the same.\n\n(26)\n\n\u2737\n\nIn what follows we will always suppose that the map \u03bb is generically finite,\nthis implies that the ideal ker(h) of k[T] is principal. Indeed, it is clear that\nker(h) is a prime ideal of codimension one since \u03bb is supposed to be generically\nfinite. As k[T] is a factorial domain, ker(h) is principal by theorem 1, VII 3.1\n[2].\n5.1 Implicitization of a hypersurface without base points\nHere we suppose that both ideals I and m of A have the same radical. This\ncondition is equivalent to say that the variety V (I) is empty in Proj(A), that\nis the polynomials f1 , . . . fn have no common roots in Proj(A).

First notice that since I and m have the same radical, I is of linear type\noutside V (m). Indeed for all prime p \u2208\n/ V (m) we have Ip = Ap and hence, by\nproposition 4.1, the approximation complex Mp is acyclic. This implies, by\nproposition 4.5, that I is of linear type outside V (m).\nNow let \u03bd be a fixed integer greater or equal to \u03b7. By proposition 5.1 we know\nthat\nannk[T] (H0 (Z\u2022 )\u03bd ) = ker(h)\nwhich is a principal ideal generated by H, that we denote hereafter by p.\nMoreover by proposition 4.7 the Z-complex associated to I is acyclic and so,\nby standard properties of determinants of complexes (see e.g. [20]), we deduce\nthat\ndet((Z\u2022 )\u03bd ) = div(H0 (Z\u2022 )\u03bd ) = length((SymA (I)\u03bd )p).[H].\nIt remains to prove that length((SymA (I)\u03bd )p) = deg(\u03bb), but this last equality\nfollows from the proof of theorem 2.5. Using the notation of the theorem 2.5,\nas I is assumed to be of linear type outside V (m),\nlength((SymA (I)\u03bd )p) = dim(k[T]/p)p \u0393(ProjA (SymA (I)p), OProjA (SymA (I)p ) (\u03bd))\n= dim(k[T]/p)p \u0393(ProjA (Bp), OProjA (Bp ) (\u03bd))\n= dim(k[T]/p)p \u0393(ProjA (Bp), OProjA (Bp ) ) = deg(\u03bb),\n\nwhere the last equality follows from (12) (and the five following lines). Finally\ntheorem 2.5 shows also that H deg(\u03bb) is of degree dn\u22122.\n\u2737\nRemark 5.3 Notice that theorem 2.5 implies that \u03bb is always generically finite if d \u2265 1 and \u03bb is a regular map (i.e. there is no base points).\nWe deduce immediately this corollary which is standard when dealing with\ndeterminants of complexes (see [12], appendix A).\nCorollary 5.4 Under the hypothesis of theorem 5.2, H deg(\u03bb) is obtained as\nthe gcd of the maximal minors of the surjective k[T]-module morphism\nd\n\nT\nA\u03bd [T],\n(Z1 )\u03bd \u2212\u2192\n\n38\n\n\ffor all \u03bd \u2265 \u03b7.\nIt is also possible to give an explicit bound for the integer \u03b7, bound which is\nhere the best possible (we will see that it is obtained for particular examples).\nProposition 5.5 (n \u2265 3) Suppose that both ideals I and m have the same\nradical, then\n0\nHm\n(SymA (I))\u03bd = 0 \u2200\u03bd \u2265 (n \u2212 2)(d \u2212 1).\nProof.

We have m = (X1 , X2 ) \u2282 A =\nk[X1 , X2 ]. We suppose that the three homogeneous polynomials f1 , f2 , f3 of\nthe same degree d \u2265 1 have no base points, that is they have no common\nfactors (in fact base points in this case are easily \"erased\" by dividing each fi\nby the gcd of f1 , f2 , f3 ; however we will see in 5.2.1 that this computation is\nnot necessary). The fi 's define hence a regular map\n\u03bb\n\nP1k \u2212\n\u2192 P2k : (X1 : X2 ) 7\u2192 (f1 : f2 : f3 )(X1 , X2 ),\nwhose image is a curve of reduced implicit equation C. All the hypothesis\nmade in the preceding paragraph are valid and it follows that the determinant\nof each complex (Z\u2022 )\u03bd , for all \u03bd \u2265 d \u2212 1, is exactly C deg(\u03bb) . These complexes\nare of the form\ndT\ndT\n0 \u2192 (Z2 )\u03bd \u2212\u2192\n(Z1 )\u03bd \u2212\u2192\nA\u03bd [T].\nBut Z2 \u2243 A(\u2212d)[T] since depthI (A) \u2265 2, and hence (Z2 )\u03bd = 0 for all \u03bd \u2264 d\u22121.\nWe deduce that the determinant of the complex (Z\u2022 )d\u22121 , which is C deg(\u03bb) , is\ndT\nin fact the determinant of the matrix (Z1 )d\u22121 \u2212\u2192\nAd\u22121 [T] of k[T]-modules,\ni.e. it is obtained as the determinant of the first syzygies of f1 , f2 , f3 in degree\nd \u22121. This result is exactly the method of moving lines which we have recalled\nin 1.1.\nConsider the simple example f1 = X12 , f2 = X1 X2 and f3 = X22 . Applying the\nmethod, the matrix of syzygies of degree d \u2212 1 is:\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec\u2212T2\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8f6\n\nT3 \uf8f7\n\nT1 T2\n\n\uf8f8,\n\nand the implicit equation is hence T22 \u2212 T1 T3 . The method fails if we try\n\u03bd = d \u2212 2.\n\n5.1.2 Implicitization of surfaces in P3k without base points\nWe consider here the particular case n = 4. We suppose that the four polynomials f1 , f2 , f3 , f4 of the same degree d have no common roots in Proj(A),\nwhere A is here the polynomial ring A = k[X1 , X2 , X3 ]. These polynomials\ndefine a regular map\n\u03bb\n\nP2k \u2212\n\u2192 P3k : (X1 : X2 : X3 ) 7\u2192 (f1 : f2 : f3 : f4 )(X1 , X2 , X3 ),\nwhose image is a surface of reduced implicit equation S. Applying the preceding results we obtain that the determinant of each complex (Z\u2022 )\u03bd , for all\n40\n\n\f\u03bd \u2265 2(d \u2212 1), is exactly S deg(\u03bb) . These complexes are of the form\nd\n\nd\n\nd\n\nT\nT\nT\n0 \u2192 (Z3 )\u03bd \u2212\u2192\n(Z2 )\u03bd \u2212\u2192\n(Z1 )\u03bd \u2212\u2192\nA\u03bd [T].\n\nAs in the case of curves we have also Z3 \u2243 A(\u2212d)[T], but here 2(d \u2212 1) \u2265 d\nsince d \u2265 1. Consequently we obtain here the equation S deg(\u03bb) as the product of\ntwo determinants divided by another one (see [12], appendix A, to compute the\ndeterminant of a complex). We illustrate it with the two following examples.\nFirst consider the example given by f1 = X12 , f2 = X22 , f3 = X32 and f4 =\nX12 + X22 + X32 . Clearly the implicit equation is T1 + T2 + T3 \u2212 T4 = 0. Applying\nour method in degree \u03bd = 2(2 \u2212 1) = 2 we compute the three matrices of the\ncomplex which are respectively (from the right to the left) of size 6 \u00d7 9, 9 \u00d7 4\nand 4 \u00d7 1. We obtain (T1 + T2 + T3 \u2212 T4 )4 as the product of two determinants\nof size 6 \u00d7 6 and 1 \u00d7 1 divided by another one of size 3 \u00d7 3. If we try the\nmethod in degree \u03bd = 1 the first matrix (on the right) is square of determinant\n(T1 + T2 + T3 \u2212 T4 )3 and the others are zero, but 3 is different from 4 which\nis the degree of the parameterization map.\nAs another example we consider f1 = X12 X2 , f2 = X22 X3 , f3 = X1 X32 and\nf4 = X13 + X23 + X33 . Applying our method in degree 4 = 2(3 \u2212 1) we find the\nirreducible implicit equation of degree 9 as the product of two determinants\nof size 15 \u00d7 15 and 3 \u00d7 3 divided by another one of size 9 \u00d7 9. The method\nfails in degree strictly less than 4.\nRemark 5.6 As we have seen, our method gives in general the implicit equation as the product of two determinants divided by another one. However, we\npoint out that the method of moving surfaces of T. Sederberg gives here (i.e. in\nthe case without base points) the implicit equation as a determinant of a square\nmatrix, as we have recalled in 1.2.\n\n5.2 Implicitization of a hypersurface with isolated local complete intersection\nbase points\nIn this paragraph we suppose that the ideal I = (f1 , . . . , fn ) of the polynomial ring A = k[X1 , . . . , Xn\u22121] is a local complete intersection in Proj(A) of\ncodimension n \u2212 2 (see definition 4.8), that is the ideal I defines points in\nPkn\u22122 which are locally generated by a regular sequence. Under this condition\nwe have depthI (A) = n \u2212 2 < depthm(A) = n \u2212 1, so proposition 4.9 shows\nthat the Z approximation complex associated to I is acyclic.

Let \u03b7 be an integer such that Hm\n(SymA (I))\u03bd = 0 for all \u03bd \u2265 \u03b7, and\ndenote by H the reduced equation (defined up to a nonzero multiple in k) of\nthe closed image of the map \u03bb.

First notice that since I is a local complete intersection in Proj(A) we\ndeduce that Hi (M) are supported on V (m) for all i \u2265 1, and hence that I is\nof linear type outside V (m). Let \u03bd be a fixed integer greater or equal to \u03b7. By\nproposition 5.1 we know that\nannk[T] (H0 (Z\u2022 )\u03bd ) = ker(h)\nwhich is a principal ideal generated by H. Moreover by proposition 4.9 the\nZ-complex associated to I is acyclic and hence, by the same argument as the\none given in the proof of theorem 5.2, we deduce that\ndet((Z\u2022 )\u03bd ) = H deg(\u03bb) .\nIn the same way, theorem 2.5 shows that the polynomial H deg(\u03bb) is of degree\ndn\u22122 \u2212 e(T, Proj(A)), and e(T, Proj(A)) = dimk \u0393(T, OT ) since T is locally a\ncomplete intersection.\n\u2737\nRemark 5.8 The hypothesis saying that \u03bb is generically finite can be tested\nusing theorem 2.5. In the particular case n = 4 the hypothesis saying that I is\na local complete intersection of codimension 2 can be tested using proposition\n4.15.\nWe deduce the standard corollary:\nCorollary 5.9 Under the hypothesis of theorem 5.7, H deg(\u03bb) is obtained as\nthe gcd of the maximal minors of the surjective k[T]-module morphism\nd\n\nT\nA\u03bd [T],\n(Z1 )\u03bd \u2212\u2192\n\nfor all \u03bd \u2265 \u03b7.\nWe now show that the bound given for the integer \u03b7 in proposition 5.5 is also\navailable here.\n42\n\n\fProposition 5.10 (n \u2265 3) Suppose that the ideal I = (f1 , . . . , fn ) is a local\ncomplete intersection in Proj(A) of codimension n \u2212 2, then\n0\nHm\n(SymA (I))\u03bd = 0 \u2200\u03bd \u2265 (n \u2212 2)(d \u2212 1).\n\nProof. This proof is quite similar to the proof of proposition 5.5. The same\n0\ni\nfirst argument shows that Hm\n(SymA (I))\u03bd = 0 for all \u03bd such that Hm\n(Zi )\u03bd = 0\nfor all i \u2265 1. We consider the Koszul complex K\u2022 (f; A) associated to the\nsequence f1 , . . . , fn over A, and denote by Zi (resp. Bi ) its i-cycles (resp. its\ni-boundaries). As depthm(A) = n \u2212 1 and depthI (A) = n \u2212 2, we know that\nBi = Zi for all i > 2. We deduce first that Zn equals 0 (and hence Zn = 0),\ni\nand second that Bn\u22121 \u2243 A(\u2212d). It follows Hm\n(Bn\u22121 ) = 0 for i 6= n \u2212 1,\nn\u22121\nn\u22121\nand Hm (Bn\u22121 )\u03bd = Hm (Zn\u22121 )\u03bd = 0 for all \u03bd \u2265 d \u2212 n + 2 (recall that\nn\u22121\nHm\n(A)\u03bd = 0 for all \u03bd > \u2212(n\u22121)). Now by iterations from the exact sequences\n0 \u2192 Bi+1 (\u2212d) \u2192 Ki+1 (\u2212d) \u2192 Bi \u2192 0,\nfor i \u2265 2, we deduce that\ni\ni\nHm\n(Bi )\u03bd = Hm\n(Zi )\u03bd = 0 \u2200 i \u2265 3 and \u2200 \u03bd \u2265 (n \u2212 3)d \u2212 n + 2,\n2\nand that Hm\n(B2 )\u03bd = 0 for all \u03bd \u2265 (n \u2212 2)d \u2212 n + 2. Also the exact se1\nquence 0 \u2192 Z1 (\u2212d) \u2192 A(\u2212d)n \u2192 I \u2192 0 shows that Hm\n(Z1 )\u03bd = 0 for all\n2\n\u03bd \u2265 d \u2212 n + 2. Finally Hm\n(H2 (a; A)) = 0 since H2 (a; A) is supported on V (I)\nwhich of dimension 1, and the exact sequence 0 \u2192 B2 \u2192 Z2 \u2192 H2 \u2192 0\n2\n2\nshows that Hm\n(Z2 )\u03bd = 0 for all \u03bd such that Hm\n(B2 )\u03bd = 0, that is for all\n\u03bd \u2265 (n \u2212 2)d \u2212 n + 2.\n\u2737\n\nWe now focus on the particular cases of interest of curves and surfaces.\n5.2.1 Implicitization of curves in P2k with base points\nWe consider here the particular case n = 3. We have m = (X1 , X2 ) \u2282 A =\nk[X1 , X2 ]. We suppose that the three homogeneous polynomials f1 , f2 , f3 of\nthe same degree d \u2265 1 have base points, that is they have a common factor. All\nthe hypothesis made in the preceding paragraph are valid and it follows that\nthe determinant of each complex (Z\u2022 )\u03bd , for all \u03bd \u2265 d \u2212 1, is exactly C deg(\u03bb) ,\nwhere C denotes the reduced implicit curve.

The determinant of the complex (Z\u2022 )d\u22121 ,\n43\n\n\fwhich is C deg(\u03bb) , is hence generally obtained as the quotient of two determinants. We can illustrate this with the simple example of 5.1.1 where we\nmultiply each equation by X1 : f1 = X13 , f2 = X12 X2 and f3 = X1 X22 . The first\nmatrix on the right is given by:\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec\u2212T2 \u2212T3 \u2212T3\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\nT1\n\n0\n\n0\n\nT1\n\n\uf8f6\n\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\n,\nT2 \u2212T3 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n0 T2\n\nand the second one is given by:\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8ec\u2212T3 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec T2 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\n\u2212T1\n\nIt follows that the implicit equation is obtained as the quotient\n\u2212T2 \u2212T3 \u2212T3\nT1\n\n0\n\nT2\n\n0\n\nT1\n\n0\n\n= \u2212T22 + T1 T3 .\n\n| \u2212 T1 |\n\n5.2.2 Implicitization of surfaces in P3k with lci base points\nWe suppose here that n = 4. As pointed out in remark 5.8, it is here possible\nto know the degree of the implicit equation we are looking for and to test if the\nbase points are locally complete intersection or not. Under the hypothesis of\ntheorem 5.7 we obtain here again that the implicit equation is the determinant\nof the complex (Z\u2022 )\u03bd , for all \u03bd \u2265 2(d \u2212 1). As in the case where there is no\nbase points, these complexes are of the form\nd\n\nd\n\nd\n\nT\nT\nT\n0 \u2192 (Z3 )\u03bd \u2212\u2192\n(Z2 )\u03bd \u2212\u2192\n(Z1 )\u03bd \u2212\u2192\nA\u03bd [T].\n\nwith Z3 \u2243 A(\u2212d)[T]. Consequently we deduce the implicit equation as the\nproduct of two determinants divided by another one.\nNotice that recently it has been proved in [7] that the method of moving\nsurfaces works with local complete intersection base points which satisfy additional conditions (see 1.2). The algorithm we propose here avoids these\ntechnical hypothesis. To illustrate it we end this section with the following\n44\n\n\fexample taken from [7], for which the (improved) moving surfaces method\nfailed. We take f1 = X1 X32 , f2 = X22 (X1 + X3 ), f3 = X1 X2 (X1 + X3 ) and\nf4 = X2 X3 (X1 + X3 ). The ideal I = (f1 , f2 , f3 , f4 ), which is not saturated, is a\nlocal complete intersection in P2 of codimension 2 defining 6 points (counted\nwith multiplicity). Applying our method in degree 2(3 \u2212 1) = 4, we obtain the\nimplicit equation as the quotient \u2206\u22060 \u22061 2 , where \u22060 is the determinant of the\nmatrix\n\uf8eb\n\n0\n\n\uf8ec T1\n\uf8ec \u2212T4\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec T4\n\uf8ec 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec \u2212T4\n\uf8ec 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0\n\uf8ed T\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nT2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u2212T3\n\nT2\n\n\u2212T4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nT2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nT1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u2212T3\n\n0\n\nT2\n\n\u2212T4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u2212T4\n\nT1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nT2\n\n\u2212T4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u2212T4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nT2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nT1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u2212T3\n\n0\n\n0\n\nT2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u2212T4\n\nT1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nT4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u2212T4\n\nT1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u2212T4\n\n0\n\n0\n\nT4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u2212T4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nT2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u2212T3\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nT1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u2212T1\n\n0\n\n0\n\nT1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u2212T1\n\n0\n\n0\n\nT1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u2212T4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nT2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n\u22061 is the determinant of\n\uf8eb\n\n0\n\n\uf8ec 0\n\uf8ec 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec T1\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0\n\uf8ec T4\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec \u2212T4\n\uf8ec 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec T1\n\uf8ed 0\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u2212T3\n\n0\n\n\u2212T4 T1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nT1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u2212T3\n\n0\n\nT4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u2212T1\n\n0\n\nT1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u2212T1\n\n0\n\nT1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nT2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nT1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u2212T4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nT2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nT4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nT1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nT2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u2212T4\n\nT1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u2212T4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nT4\n\n0\n\n\u2212T4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nT2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nT2 \u2212T4\n\n\u2212T1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nT2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nT1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u2212T1\n\n0\n\nT1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u2212T4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nT2\n\n\u2212T4 T1\n\n!\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\nand \u22063 is the determinant of\n0\n0\n\nT1\n\n0\n\n\u2212T1\n\n0\n\nT1\n\n.\n\nWe deduce that the desired equation is T1 T2 T3 + T1 T2 T4 \u2212 T3 T42 . Point out\nthat, trying our method empirically, we find the latter equation by applying\ntheorem 5.7 with \u03bd = 3, and even \u03bd = 2. For the case \u03bd = 3 the equation is\nobtained as a similar quotient \u2206\u22060 \u22061 2 , where here \u22060 is of size 10 \u00d7 10, \u22061 of\nsize 8 \u00d7 8, and \u22062 of size 1 \u00d7 1. For the case \u03bd = 2, the equation is obtained\n0\n(the third map of the Z-complex in this degree degenerates\nas a quotient \u2206\n\u22061\nto zero), where \u22060 is of size 6 \u00d7 6 and \u22061 of size 3 \u00d7 3.\n45\n\n\fA\n\nKravitsky's formula and anisotropic resultant\n\nLet k be a commutative ring, X and Y be two indeterminates, and P, Q, R \u2208\nk[X, Y ]d be three homogeneous polynomials of same given degree d \u2265 1. Introducing three new indeterminates u, v, w, we may consider the following d \u00d7 d\nmatrix with coefficients in k[u, v, w]:\n\u03a9 := uBez(Q, R) + vBez(R, P ) + wBez(P, Q).\nLet Z be another new indeterminate. Setting the weight of X, Y, Z respectively\nto 1, 1, d, the polynomials P \u2212 uZ, Q \u2212 vZ, R \u2212 wZ are isobaric of weight d;\nwe can hence consider the anisotropic resultant (see [17] and [18])\nR := a Res(P \u2212 uZ, Q \u2212 vZ, R \u2212 wZ) \u2208 k[u, v, w].\nProposition With the preceding notations, we have the equality\nR = (\u22121)\n\nd(d+1)\n2\n\ndet(\u03a9)\n\nin k[u, v, w].\nProof. By specialization, it is sufficient to prove this proposition in case P, Q, R\nhave indeterminate coefficients and k = Z[coeff(P, Q, R)], that we suppose\nhereafter. The generic polynomials P \u2212 uZ, Q \u2212 vZ, R \u2212 wZ are isobar of\nweight d, and d is a multiple of the lcm of the weights of X, Y, Z. In this way\nR is irreducible, and normalized by the condition\na\n\nRes(X d , Y d , Z) = 1.\n\nWe denote A := Z[coeff(P, Q, R)][u, v, w] and B := A[X, Y, Z]/(P \u2212 uZ, Q \u2212\n0\nvZ, R \u2212 wZ). We know that the ideal Hm\n(B), where m = (X, Y, Z), is prime,\n0\nand that, by definition, R is a generator of the ideal Hm\n(B)0 of A. For all\nL \u2208 k[X, Y ] we denote L\u0303 := L(X, 1) \u2208 k[X], and it follows that the ring\nB\u0303 := A[X, Z]/(P\u0303 \u2212 uZ, Q\u0303 \u2212 vZ, R\u0303 \u2212 wZ)\nhas no zero divisors, and that\n0\nHm\n(B)0 = A \u2229 (P\u0303 \u2212 uZ, Q\u0303 \u2212 vZ, R\u0303 \u2212 wZ) in A[X, Z].\n\nFinally, we know that\nRes(P \u2212 uZ d , Q \u2212 vZ d , R \u2212 wZ d ) = Rd ,\n46\n\n\fwhere Res denotes the classical resultant of three homogeneous polynomials,\nwhich shows that R is homogeneous of degree 3d2 /d = 3d in the coefficients\nof the polynomials P \u2212 uZ, Q \u2212 vZ, R \u2212 wZ.\nNow introduce new indeterminates T1 , . . . , Td , and denote by\n\u2206(T1 , . . . , Td ) := (T d\u2212j )1\u2264i,j\u2264d\nthe Vandermonde's matrix.
