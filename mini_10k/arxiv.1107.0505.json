Recall that by an entanglement\nwitness [3], we understand a Hermitian operator, usually denoted by W , acting on some bipartite Hilbert space\nCm \u2297 Cn such that hW i\u03c3 - 0 for any separable state [4] \u03c3\nacting on Cm \u2297Cn , while for some entangled \u033a, hW i\u033a < 0.\nIn the latter case, we say briefly that entanglement of \u033a\nor just \u033a is detected by the EW W , hence the term [5].\nWhat makes these objects important from an entanglement detection point of view is that (as proven in Refs.\n[3] and [6]) for any entangled state (bipartite or multipartite) there exists some EW detecting it (i.e., having\nnegative mean value in this state). Much effort has been\nput toward designing EWs that detect entanglement in\nvarious bipartite and multipartite physical systems (see,\ne.g., Ref. [7]). They also allow for the quantitative analysis of entanglement (see, e.g., Ref. [8]), and, finally, since\nthese objects are just quantum observables, the qualitative and quantitative detection of entanglement is feasible\nfrom the experimental point of view [9].\nParticularly important for the characterization of EWs\nis the notion of optimality introduced in Ref. [10] (see also\nRef. [11] for a state-dependent definition of optimality).\nRoughly speaking, optimal EWs are the ones that detect\n(in the set-theoretic terms) the largest set of entangled\nstates. In other words, a given EW W is optimal if there\nexist no other witness detecting the same states as W and\nadditionally some states which are not detected by W .\nAs every witness can be optimized [10], it happens that\nthe optimal EWs are sufficient to detect all the entangled\nstates. It is then of significant importance to isolate and\ncharacterize the set of optimal EWs.\nMany interesting results have been obtained in research aiming to realize this goal (see, e.g., Refs. [12] and\n[13]). However, though this effort, the characterization\nof optimal EWs is far from being accomplished, and our\nknowledge about their structure remains unsatisfactory.\nVery recently, in Ref. [14], some of us have have provi-\n\nC\n\nded a more exhaustive characterization of all qubit-qunit\ndecomposable EWs (DEWs). It was shown that product\nvectors orthogonal to any completely entangled subspace\n(CES) of C2 \u2297 Cn , after being partially conjugated, span\nthe latter. On the level of DEWs, together with results\nalready established in Ref. [10], this means that for any\nDEW W acting on C2 \u2297 Cn the following two equivalences hold: (i) W is optimal if and only if (iff) it takes\nthe form W = Q\u0393 with Q - 0 supported on some CES\nand (ii) W is optimal iff the qubit-qunit product vectors\nsatisfying he, f |W |e, f i = 0 span C2 \u2297 Cn . Since it is important for our considerations, let us refer to the latter\nproperty as the property of spanning.\nOn the other hand, it was shown in Ref. [14] that already the two-qutrit DEWs do not follow the above characterization. More precisely, while for all DEWs W = Q\u0393\nwith Q of rank 1 or 2, the above equivalences also hold, in\nthe case when r(Q) = 3, 4 either there exist non-optimal\nDEWs taking the above form or there exist optimal witnesses without the property of spanning. While the former question has very recently been solved [15], the latter one seems particularly interesting and has not been\nanswered so far. The existence of optimal EWs without\nthe property of spanning is already known in the case\nof indecomposable witnesses, where one has the so-called\nChoi witness, that is, an indecomposable EW acting on\nC3 \u2297 C3 generated from the known Choi map [16, 17].\n(For the proof that this witness does not have the property of spanning, see Ref. [13].) This fact, however, remains\nunknown in the decomposable case.\nThe primary purpose of this paper is to clarify this point and show that for any Hilbert space Cm \u2297 Cn , obviously except for C2 \u2297Cn , there always exist such witnesses.\nThe secondary aim is to discuss possible generalizations\nof the results obtained in Ref. [14] to higher-dimensional\nDEWs. In particular, we show that under some condition all CESs supported in Cn \u2297 Cn of dimension n \u2212 1\nhave the property of spanning. Then, we prove that any\nCES in Hn of dimension less than n \u2212 1 can be extended\n(i.e., is a subspace) to some (n \u2212 1)-dimensional CES and\ntherefore also inherits this property.\nWe apply this analysis to the CESs supported in\n\n\f2\n\nC4 \u2297 C4 . We show that all such CESs of dimension 3 obey\n\nthe above condition. Consequently, for all two-ququart\nDEWs W = Q\u0393 with r(Q) \u00ac 3, the above equivalences also hold. Together with the already obtained results\nfor two-qubit and two-qutrit DEWs [14], this suggests\nto conjecture that the above equivalences are valid for\nDEWs W = Q\u0393 acting on Cn \u2297Cn with r(Q) \u00ac n\u22121. However, we provide examples of (n \u2212 1)-dimensional CESs\nsupported in Cm \u2297 Cn with 3 \u00ac m \u00ac n without the\nproperty of spanning, meaning that the local dimensions\nplay some role in the above conjecture.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we recall basic notions regarding witnesses and optimality. In\nSec. III, we present our main results, that is, examples of\noptimal DEWs without the property of spanning. In Sec.\nIV, we discuss the general situation with respect to characterization of optimal DEWs. We conclude with Sec. V\nand outline possible directions for further research.\n\nII.\n\nPRELIMINARIES AND THE PROBLEM\n\nFirst, we set the notation and recall the basic notions and known facts regarding EWs and, in particular,\nDEWs.\nBy Hm,n , Mm,n , and Dm,n we denote, respectively,\nthe product Hilbert space Cm \u2297 Cn , the set Mm (C) \u2297\nMn (C) with Md (C) standing for the set of d\u00d7 d complex\nmatrices, and finally the subset of positive elements of\nMm,n with unit trace. In the case when the dimensions\nof both subsystems are equal, we use shorter notation:\nHm , Mm , and Dm , respectively. By the Schmidt rank of\na pure state |\u03c8i \u2208 Hm,n we understand the rank of a\ndensity matrix of one of the subsystems of |\u03c8i. Then, we\nsay that a subspace V of Cm \u2297 Cn is supported in the\nlatter if V cannot be embedded in some Hilbert space\nV1 \u2297 V2 , where either V1 or V2 is a proper subspace of\nCm or Cn , respectively. Finally, we often denote vectors\nfrom Cm in the following way:\n\nCm \u220b |f i =\n\nm\u22121\nX\n\nfi |ii = (f0 , f1 , . . . , fm\u22121 ).\n\n(1)\n\ni=0\n\nBy an entanglement witness (EW), we understand a\nHermitian operator W \u2208 Mm,n which is block-positive,\ni.e., such that he, f |W |e, f i - 0 holds for any product\nvector |e, f i \u2208 Hm,n , and there exist entangled states \u03c1\nfor which Tr(W \u03c1) < 0.\nWe call an EW W decomposable [10] if it can be written\nas\nW = P + Q\u0393 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwith P and Q being positive operators. EWs which do\nnot admit this form are called indecomposable. From now\non we restrict our attention to decomposable EWs since\nour results concern only this subset.\n\nWe can now turn to the notion of optimality. For this\npurpose, for a given EW W \u2208 Mm,n let us introduce the\nfollowing sets\nPW = {|e, f i \u2208 Hm,n |he, f |W |e, f i = 0}\n\n(3)\n\nDW = {\u033a \u2208 Dm,n |Tr(\u033aW ) < 0}.\n\n(4)\n\nand\n\nNow, taking two EWs Wi (i = 1, 2), we say that W1 is\nfiner that W2 if DW2 \u2286 DW1 . Then, if there does not\nexist any witness which is finer than W \u2208 Mm,n , we\ncall it optimal. That is optimal EWs are those that are\nmaximal with respect to the above relation of inclusion.\nIn Ref. [10], it was shown that an EW W \u2208 Mm,n\nf (\u01eb, P ) = W \u2212 \u01ebP\nis optimal if and only if the matrix W\nis no longer block-positive for any \u01eb > 0 and P - 0.\nClearly, in order to verify the optimality of a given EW\nW , it suffices to check the above condition for positive\nP supported on subspaces that are orthogonal to PW\nbecause for any P for which P PW 6= 0 there always exists\na product vector |e, f i \u2208 PW such that he, f |P |e, f i =\n6 0\nand therefore he, f |W \u2212 \u01ebP |e, f i = \u2212he, f |P |e, f i < 0.\nThis fact immediately implies a sufficient condition for\noptimality:\n(i): If PW spans Hm,n then the EW W \u2208 Mm,n is optimal.\nSince the latter property is directly related to the notion of optimality, let us remember that we refer to it as\nproperty of spanning.\nFurthermore, application of this condition for optimality to the DEWs (2) yields the necessary condition for\noptimality of DEWs [10]:\n(ii): If a given DEW W \u2208\nto be of the form\nW = Q\u0393 ,\n\nQ - 0,\n\nMm,n is optimal, then it has\nQ supported on CES,\n\n(5)\n\nthat is, Q is a positive operator supported on some completely entangled subspace.\nIt has been whether the opposite implications of (i)\nand (ii) also hold. Clearly, a solution to this problem is\ncrucial from the point of view of a complete characterization of optimal DEWs. As already said, both statements\nbecome equivalences for all DEWs from M2,n and some\nfrom M3,3 [14]. Quite surprisingly, however, the existence\nof nonoptimal DEWs taking the form (5) has very recently been reported [15] (see also Ref. [18] in this context),\nproving that in general the opposite statement to (ii) does not hold. In particular, it is a consequence of the fact\nthat generally one is able to decompose Hm,n (except for\nH2,n and H3 ) as a direct sum of two CESs[? ] (see, e.g.,\nRef. [19]). Any such CES can support a DEW of the form\n(5), however, the latter cannot be tangent to the set of\nseparable states, and thus it is certainly not an optimal\nwitness [15].\n\n\f3\nThe primary aim of the present paper is to disprove also the inverse of (i) for general DEWs. For this purpose,\nwe first prove that some of the two-qutrit witnesses without the property of spanning found in Ref. [14] are optimal. Then, we generalize these examples to every Hm,n\nwith m, n - 3, showing that every Hilbert space (except\nfor H2,n ) admits optimal DEWs (in the sense that there exist DEWs acting on this Hilbert space) without the\nproperty of spanning.\nIt should also be emphasized that our construction provides examples of optimal DEWs without the property\nof spanning. Recall that in the indecomposable case the\nonly examples known so far arise from the Choi map [16].\nAnother aim of our paper is to provide some generalizations of the results of Ref. [14] to higher-dimensional\nHilbert spaces Hm,n .\nLet us notice that we can look at the above problems from a more general perspective. To determine\nthe set PW for DEWs (5), we need to find the product vectors |e, f i \u2208 Hm,n obeying 0 = he, f |Q\u0393 |e, f i =\nhe, f \u2217 |Q|e, f \u2217 i. Because Q - 0 and supp(Q) is a CES,\nthe problem of determining PW reduces to the problem\nof determining product vectors in V \u22a5 for V being a CES\nof Hm,n . Furthermore, it is fairly easy to see that every\nCES V admits (is the sense of being supported on V ) a\npositive Q giving rise to a proper EW (that is Q\u0393 0).\nConsequently, instead of working in terms of particular\nQs we can work in terms of CESs of Hm,n . For any CES\nV let us then define the analog of PW (defined for EWs):\nPV = {|e, f \u2217 i \u2208 Hm,n | |e, f i \u2208 V \u22a5 }.\n\n(6)\n\nRecall that CESs were already investigated in the literature (see Refs. [20\u201323]), and the largest dimension of\na CES in Hm,n is (m \u2212 1)(n \u2212 1). This translates to an\nupper bound on the possible ranks of Q in Eq. (5). In\nthe case of H2,n this reduces to n \u2212 1 and all CESs of\ndimension less or equal n \u2212 1 have the property of spanning [14]. For the higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces, our\nresult clearly establishes an upper bound on the largest\ndimension for all CESs to have the property of spanning,\nwhich is dim V < n. We conjecture that this bound is tight when local dimensions are equal, while we show that\nwhen m < n there exist CESs of dimension n \u2212 1 without\nthe property of spanning.\n\nIII. COMPLETELY ENTANGLED SUBSPACES\nWITHOUT THE PROPERTY OF SPANNING\n\nLet us introduce some additional notation. Clearly, any\nvector |xi \u2208 Cm can be written as |xi = x0 |0i \u2295 |e\nxi with\n|e\nxi \u2208 span{|1i, . . . , |m \u2212 1i}. In what follows, |e\nxi always\ndenotes a vector coming from the above decomposition.\ne we denote the (m \u2212\nAlso, for any A : Cm \u2192 Cm , by A\n1) \u00d7 (m \u2212 1) matrix obtained from A by removing its first\nrow and first column.\n\nA.\n\nThe case of equal dimensions\n\nLet us start from the case of equal dimensions of both\nsubsystems and consider the m-dimensional subspace V\nof Hm spanned by the vectors\n|\u03a8i i = ai |0i|ii \u2212 bi |ii|0i\n\n(i = 1, . . . , m \u2212 1)\n\n(7)\n\nwith ai , bi 6= 0 and |\u03a8m i being so far any non-product\nvector from (span{|1i, . . . , |m \u2212 1i})\u22972. It is useful to notice that via the vectors-matrices isomorphism (see the\nAppendix), |\u03a8i i (i = 1, . . . , m \u2212 1) correspond to matrices Ai = ai |0ihi| \u2212 bi |iih0| and |\u03a8m i correspond to some,\nso far unspecified, matrix Am having the entries of the\nfirst row and the first column all equal to zero and whose\nrank obeys 2 \u00ac r(Am ) \u00ac m\u2212 1. For the sake of simplicity\nwe assume that r(Am ) = m \u2212 1 (|\u03a8m i has Schmidt rank\nm \u2212 1).\nBefore going into detail, it should be noticed that by\na local nonsingular transformation on one of the subsystems, the subspace V can be transformed to a subspace spanned by |\u03a8\u2032i i = |0i|ii \u2212 |ii|0i (i = 1, . . . , m \u2212 1)\nand |\u03a8\u2032m i which is again a nonproduct vector from\n(span{|1i, . . . , |m \u2212 1i})\u22972 . Since local nonsingular transformations do not influence our analysis at all, in further\nconsiderations we can assume that ai = bi = 1.\nFinally, it is fairly easy to see that V is a completely\nentangled subspace (see the Appendix for the detailed\nproof).\nNow, let us find all the product vectors |x, yi (|xi, |yi \u2208\nCm ) orthogonal to V . This can be done by solving a\nsystem of m linear homogenous equations\nh\u03a8i |x, yi = 0\n\n(i = 1, . . . , m),\n\n(8)\n\nwhich can be restated as the system of equations for the\nvector |yi of the form\nM (x)|yi = 0\n\n(9)\n\nwith the m \u00d7 m |xi-dependent matrix M (x) given by\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nx1\n\u2212x0\n0 ...\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n..\n\uf8ec x2\n\uf8f7\n0\n\u2212x0 . . .\n.\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7.\n.\n.\n.\n..\nM (x) = \uf8ec .\n.\n.\n\uf8f7\n.\n.\n0\n.\n\uf8ec .\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed xm\u22121\n\uf8f8\n0\n... ...\n\u2212x0\n0\nhx\u2217 |A\u2217m |1i . . . . . . hx\u2217 |A\u2217m |m \u2212 1i\n(10)\nClearly, Eq. (9) has a nontrivial solution iff det M (x) = 0.\nAfter simple algebra the latter can be rewritten as\ndet M (x) = (\u22121)m xm\u22121\n0\n\nm\u22121\nX\n\nxi [A\u2217m ]ij xj\n\ni,j=1\n\n(\u22121)m xm\u22121\nhx\u2217 |A\u2217m |xi\n0\n\n=\n= 0,\n\n(11)\n\u2217\n\n|A\u2217m |xi\n\nand is satisfied iff either x0 = 0 or hx\n= 0. Both\nconditions induce two sets of product vectors in V \u22a5 , denoted henceforth as S1 and S2 .\n\n\f4\nIn the first case, when x0 = 0, it follows from Eqs. (9)\nand (10) the vector |yi has to obey two conditions y0 = 0\ne\u2217 |e\nand hx\u2217 |A\u2217m |yi = he\nx\u2217 |A\nm y i = 0. Consequently, the set\nS1 consists of product vectors taking the form\n\u2217 \u22a5\neT |e\n(0, |e\nxi) \u2297 (0, (A\nm x i) )\n\n(12)\n\n(x0 , |e\nxi) \u2297 (x0 , |e\nxi)\n\n(13)\n\neTm |e\nwith arbitrary |e\nxi and (A\nx\u2217 i)\u22a5 denoting any vector\nfrom (m \u2212 2)-dimensional subspace of Cm\u22121 orthogonal\n\u2217\neT |e\nto A\nm x i.\ne\u2217 |e\nIn the second case, when hx\u2217 |A\u2217m |xi = he\nx\u2217 |A\nm xi = 0,\nit clearly follows from (10) that |yi = (y0 /x0 )|xi (we\ncan obviously assume x0 6= 0), which together with the\nabove condition determines the second set S2 of product\nvectors in V \u22a5 . These are precisely the vectors taking the\nfollowing form:\n\ne\u2217 |e\nwith |e\nxi obeying he\nx\u2217 |A\nm xi = 0.\nWe are now prepared to show that for an appropriate\nchoice of the matrix Am , the set PV does not span Hm .\nFor this purpose, we denote by S1\u2217 and S2\u2217 the partially\nconjugated vectors from S1 and S1 , respectively. Then,\nclearly, PV = S1\u2217 \u222a S2\u2217 .\nSince we have still some freedom in the vector |\u03a8m i,\nlet us check under which conditions each set does not\nspan Hm . First, it is fairly straightforward to see that\ndim spanS1\u2217 = (m\u22121)2 . For this purpose let P\nus determine\nthe conditions under which a vector |\u03c8i = ij \u03b1ij |iji \u2208\nHm is orthogonal to all the elements of S1\u2217 .\nAt the beginning, observe that due to the form of vectors from S1 , \u03b1s with one of the indices being zero are\narbitrary, implying already that dim span S1\u2217 \u00ac (m \u2212 1)2 .\nIn order to prove equality, we show that the remaining\n\u03b1s, forming a matrix \u03b1\ne (see the Appendix), have to be 0.\nIn terms of \u03b1\ne, the condition for |\u03c8i to be orthogonal to\nS1\u2217 , takes the form\nhe\nx|e\n\u03b1|e\nyi = 0\n\n(14)\n\ne\u2217m |e\nfor any |e\nxi, |e\ny i \u2208 Cm\u22121 obeying he\nx\u2217 |A\ny i = 0. This is\nequivalent to saying that |e\nyi \u22a5 \u03b1\ne\u2020 |e\nxi for an arbitrary\n\u2217\neT |e\n(m \u2212 1)-dimensional |e\nxi and |e\ny i fulfilling |e\nyi \u22a5 A\nm x i.\nT\n\u2217\ne\ne\nBy the assumption that A is of full rank, Am |e\nx i=\n6 0 for\nany |e\nx\u2217 i. Then, for a fixed |e\nxi, the vector \u03b1\ne\u2020 |e\nxi is perpeneTm |e\ndicular to the (m \u2212 2)-dimensional subspace (A\nx\u2217 i)\u22a5\neTm |e\nx\u2217 i, where kx is a scalar dein Cm\u22121 , so \u03b1\ne\u2020 |e\nxi = kx A\npending on |e\nxi.\nNow, one easily checks that for all |e\nxi, the constant\nkx has to be independent of |e\nxi; let it be denoted by k.\nConsequently, the condition that \u03b1\ne must obey may be\n\u2217\neT |e\nnow written as \u03b1\ne\u2020 |e\nxi = k A\nx\ni\nfor\nall |e\nxi \u2208 Cm\u22121 . Let\nm\nus write the latter for two vectors, |e\nxi and i|e\nxi, which\ngives us\n\u2217\neT |e\n\u03b1\ne\u2020 |e\nxi = k A\nm x i,\neT |e\nie\n\u03b1\u2020 |e\nxi = \u2212ik A\nx\u2217 i.\nm\n\nIt means that for any |e\nxi \u2208 Cm\u22121 , \u03b1\ne\u2020 |e\nxi = \u2212e\n\u03b1\u2020 |e\nxi, and\nhence \u03b1\ne = 0.\nSecond, the dimension of span S2\u2217 depends on the matrix Am . This is because one of the conditions defining\neTm |e\nS2\u2217 that |e\nx\u2217 i \u22a5 A\nxi can be seen as a second-order equation for some xi (i = 1, . . . , m \u2212 1). In the case when the\nlatter has two different solutions, xi is a nonlinear function of the remaining xj (j 6= i) (and also of the entries\nof Am ) and thus linearly independent of them. In such\ncase S2\u2217 spans Hm .\ne\u2217m |e\nIt may happen, however, that he\nx\u2217 |A\nxi = 0 has a\nsingle solution with respect to some xi (i = 1, . . . , m \u2212 1)\nand then it is just a linear combination of the remaining\nentries of |xi. As a result, the set S2\u2217 spans only (m \u2212 1)2 dimensional subspace. This is the situation we look for\nbecause it may lead (and, as we will see shortly, does lead)\nto optimal witnesses without the property of spanning.\nem is given by\nFor instance, this happens when A\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1 2 ... 2\n\uf8ec\n. . .. \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n. . \uf8f7\nem = \uf8ec 0 1\n\uf8f7.\nA\n(15)\n\uf8ec . .\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed .. . . . . . 2 \uf8f8\n0 ... 0 1\nIn this case, a direct check shows that one of the conditions defining the set S2 reduces now to\ne\u2217m |e\nhe\nx\u2217 |A\nxi = x1 + . . . + xm\u22121 = 0.\n\n(16)\n\nFrom now on, let us concentrate on this particular case\nem is given by Eq. (15)] and show that the\n[i.e., when A\ncompletely entangled subspace V defined in this way does not have the property of spanning, that is, PV does\nnot span Hm . To this end, we determine (span PV )\u22a5 . Let\nP\nus take again the vector |\u03c8i = m\u22121\ni,j=0 \u03b1ij |iji from Hm .\nWe already know that it is orthogonal to S1\u2217 iff \u03b1ij = 0\nfor i, j = 1, . . . , m \u2212 1. Then, the resulting |\u03c8i is orthogonal to S2\u2217 iff \u03b100 = 0, \u03b10i = \u03b10,m\u22121 , and \u03b1i0 = \u03b1m\u22121,0\nwith i = 1, . . . , m \u2212 2. As a consequence, the orthogonal\ncomplement of span PV is a two-dimensional subspace of\nHm spanned by the vectors\n|\u03c61 i = |0i|\u03c9i,\n\n|\u03c62 i = |\u03c9i|0i,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere |\u03c9i = |1i + . . . + |m \u2212 1i.\n\nB.\n\nThe case of arbitrary dimensions\n\nBefore going into detail, let us comment on the notation we use throughout this section. Given a vector |zi\nfrom Cn , we often decompose it as |zi = |z \u2032 i \u2295 |z \u2032\u2032 i with\n|z \u2032 i \u2208 span{|0i, . . . , |m \u2212 1i} and the rest |z \u2032\u2032 i.\nIn this section, we extend the already defined mdimensional CES V of Hm to an n-dimensional CES\nV in the arbitrary dimensional Hilbert space Hm,n with\nm, n - 3. For simplicity, let us assume that n > m. We\n\n\f5\nprove that the subspace V does not have the property of\nspanning.\nFirst, let us take the vectors |\u03a8i i (i = 1, . . . , m) (with\n|\u03a8m i defined in Eq. (15), embed them in Cm \u2297 Cn (n >\nm), and then supply with the following m \u2212 n vectors:\n|\u03a8i i = |1i|i \u2212 2i \u2212 |2i|i \u2212 1i\n\n(i = m + 1, . . . , n). (18)\n\nClearly, V = span{|\u03a8i i}ni=1 is a n-dimensional subspace\nin Hm,n , which does not contain any product vector (see\nthe Appendix for the detailed proof).\nAs before, looking for the product vectors |x, yi (|xi \u2208\nCm , |yi \u2208 Cn ) orthogonal to V , we arrive at the system\nof linear equations [similar to the one given in Eq. 8],\nwhich can be stated as\nN (x)|yi = 0,\n\n(19)\n\nwith the n \u00d7 n matrix N (x) given by\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nN (x) = \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n0 . . . 0 x0 \u2212x1 0\n0\n... 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n0\n... 0 \uf8f7\n0 . . . . . . 0 x0 \u2212x1\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f7\n0 ... ... 0\n0\nx0 \u2212x1 . . . 0 \uf8f7\n..\n..\n.. \uf8f7\n.. .. .. ..\n..\n..\n\uf8f7\n.\n.\n.\n.\n. \uf8f8\n. . . .\n0\n...\n0\nx0 \u2212x1\n0 ... ... 0\n(20)\nM (x) being the m \u00d7 m matrix already introduced in Eq.\n(10), and 0n\u2212m being the (n \u2212 m) \u00d7 (n \u2212 m) zero matrix.\nThe above system has nontrivial solutions iff\ndet N (x) = 0, meaning that either det M (x) = 0 or\nx1 = 0. We already know that the first condition holds iff\neither x0 = 0 or x1 + * * * + xm\u22121 = 0, giving us, as before,\ntwo sets of product vectors orthogonal to V (denoted respectively by S 1 and S 2 ). Additionally, however, we have\na third set of vectors S 3 corresponding to the third solution x1 = 0 of the above determinantal equation. Let us\nnow determine these sets.\nThe first one, S 1 , we get by putting x0 = 0 in Eq. (20).\nIn this case, the matrix N (x) has a simple block-diagonal\nform, that is, N (x) = M (x) \u2295 (\u2212x1 )1n\u2212m , with 1d denoting the d \u00d7 d identity matrix. Clearly, Eq. (19) implies\nthat |yi has to satisfy \u2212x1 |y \u2032\u2032 i = 0 and M (x)|y \u2032 i = 0.\nWhile the former condition immediately gives |y \u2032\u2032 i = 0,\nthe latter one, together with x0 = 0, implies as before\nthat y0 = 0 and that |y \u2032 i has to be orthogonal to ATm |x\u2217 i\nor, in other words, has to obey the equation\nM (x)\n\nm\u22121\nX\ni=1\n\nxi yi + 2\n\n0n\u2212m\n\nm\u22121\nX\n\nxj yk = 0.\n\n(21)\n\ni<j=1\n\nnotice that this is the same class as S1 (see Sec. III A)\nbut is embedded in a larger Hilbert space Hm,n .\nIn the second case, when x1 +* * *+xm\u22121 = 0, Eqs. (19)\nand (20) imply that M (x)|y \u2032 i = 0 and yi = (x0 /x1 )yi\u22121\nfor i = m, . . . , n \u2212 1. From the first condition we simply get |y \u2032 i = (y0 /x0 )|xi. The remaining equations can\nbe rewritten as yi = (x0 /x1 )i\u2212m+1 ym\u22121 and then, taking into account that ym\u22121 = (y0 /x0 )xm\u22121 , as yi =\n(y0 /x0 )(x0 /x1 )i\u2212m+1 xm\u22121 with i = m, . . . , n \u2212 1. Consequently, the second set S 3 has the following elements:\n|xi \u2297 [|xi \u2295 xm\u22121 (t, t2 , . . . , tn\u2212m )],\n\n(23)\n\nwhere t = y0 /x0 and xs have to satisfy x1 + * * * + xm\u22121 =\n0.\nThe third set S 1 consists of product vectors solving\nthe system (19) in the case when x1 = 0. From Eqs.\n(19) and (20), it follows that |yi has to obey M (x)|y \u2032 i =\n0 and x0 yi = 0 for i = m \u2212 1, . . . , n \u2212 2. While the\nlatter conditions immediately imply that yi = 0 for i =\nm \u2212 1, . . . , n \u2212 2, the former, together with the initial\ncondition x1 = 0, yields y1 = 0, |y \u2032 i = (y0 /x0 )|xi, and\nx2 + * * *+ xm\u22122 = 0. Taking all these conditions together,\nwe see that the product vectors from S 1 take the form\n|xi \u2297 [(y0 /x0 )|xi \u2295 (0, . . . , 0, yn\u22121 )],\n\n(24)\n\nwith |xi given by\n|xi = (x0 , 0, x2 , . . . , xm\u22122 , 0),\n\n(25)\n\nwhere x2 + * * * + xm\u22122 = 0.\nHaving determined all the product vectors in V \u22a5 , we\ncan now show that PV does not span Hm,n . Recall that\nPV consists of partial conjugations of elements of the sets\n\u2217\nSi . Denoting partially conjugated vectors from S i by S i\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n(i = 1, 2, 3), we have PV = S 1 \u222a S 2 \u222a S 3 .\n\u2217\n\u2217\nFirst, let us notice that span PV = span S 1 \u222a S 2 . Second, let us take a vector |\u03c8i \u2208 Hm,n with entries in the\nstandard basis denoted by \u03b1ij . Short algebra shows that\n\u2217\nit is orthogonal to S 1 iff \u03b1ij = 0 (i, j = 1, . . . , m \u2212 1).\n\u2217\nThen, |\u03c8i is orthogonal to S 2 iff the following set of condition holds\n\u03b100 = 0,\n\u03b10j = 0\n\u03b1i0 = \u03b110\n\u03b10j = \u03b101\n\u03b1ij = \u03b11j\n\n(j = m, . . . , n \u2212 1),\n(26)\n(i = 2, . . . , m \u2212 1),\n(j = 2, . . . , m \u2212 1),\n(i = 2, . . . , m \u2212 1; j = m, . . . , n \u2212 1).\n\nFrom this analysis, it clearly follows that PV does not\nspan Hm,n and the (n \u2212 m + 2)-dimensional subspace\nK = (span PV )\u22a5 is spanned by the vectors |\u03c61 i, |\u03c62 i,\nand |\u03c6j\u2212m+3 i = |\u03c9i|ji (j = m, . . . , n \u2212 1).\n\nIn conclusion, S 1 consists of vectors\n(0, x1 , . . . , xm\u22121 ) \u2297 [(0, y1 , . . . , ym\u22121 ) \u2295 0n\u2212m ],\n\n(22)\n\nwhere all xs and ys have to obey the condition (21) and\n0n\u2212m stands for (n \u2212 m)-dimensional zero vector. Let us\n\nC.\n\nOptimal decomposable witnesses\n\nWhat remains to be proven is that the subspace V\nadmits optimal decomposable witnesses, that is, one is\n\n\f6\nable to find a positive Q supported on V of rank n such\nthat Q\u0393 is a optimal decomposable EW. As we will see\nshortly, this can be achieved by taking Q of the form\nQ=\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03bbi |\u03a8i ih\u03a8i |\n\n(27)\n\ni=1\n\nwith \u03bbi > 0 (i = 1, . . . , n). Clearly, by definition, Q is a\npositive matrix supported on V of rank n, and moreover,\nit is straightforward to see that it is NPT for any choice\nof \u03bbs, thus giving rise to proper DEWs. Notice also that\nhere PW of W = Q\u0393 is exactly the same as PV .\nAccording to what was said in Sec. II, we need to prof (\u01eb, P ) = Q\u0393 \u2212 \u01ebP is no longer\nve that the operator W\na witness for any \u01eb > 0, with P being positive matrices obeying P \u22a5 PV . The latter are the positive operators supported on (n \u2212 m + 2)-dimensional subspace\nK = (spanPV )\u22a5 = span{|\u03c6i i}n\u2212m+2\n. Let us prove our\ni=1\nstatement for the case when P is just a one-dimensional\nprojector onto a general vector from K, that is,\n|\u03c6i =\n\nn\u2212m+2\nX\n\n(ai \u2208 C).\n\nai |\u03c6i i\n\n(28)\n\ni=1\n\nThen, clearly, the proof will follow for an arbitrary P - 0\nsupported on K.\nDenoting by P\u03c6 the projector onto |\u03c6i, one checks that\nfor the product vector |ui\u2297|v \u2217 i, where |vi = |ui\u2295u0 1n\u2212m\nand u0 = u1 = um\u22121 , the following holds:\n\nIV. FURTHER RESULTS ON THE GENERAL\nOPTIMAL DECOMPOSABLE WITNESSES\n\nLet us now ask whether and how the results obtained in\nRef. [14] for qubit-qunit witnesses can be generalized to\nDEWs acting on Hm,n with m, n - 3. Following Ref. [14]\nand the structure of equations defining product vectors\nin an orthogonal complement of some CES, we surmise\nthat for any CES V of Hm,n with dimV \u00ac n \u2212 1 the\ncorresponding PV spans Hm,n . The main purpose of this\nsection is to comment on this issue.\nFirst, we show that under some assumption, which is\ngenerically obeyed and conjectured to hold always, all\nCESs of Hn of dimension n \u2212 1 have the property of\nspanning. Then, we prove that any r-dimensional CES is\na subspace of some (r + 1)-dimensional CES. Consequently, provided the above conjecture holds, all CESs in Hn\nof dimension n \u2212 1 or less have the property of spanning.\nThen, we prove that the mentioned assumption is always fulfilled for CESs supported in H4 of dimension 3.\nTherefore, due to the above fact, any CES supported\nin H4 of dimension less or equal to 3 has the property\nof spanning, and hence for all witnesses (5) in M4 with\nr(Q) \u00ac 3, the statements (i) and (ii) (see Sec. II) become\nequivalences.\nTo be more precise, let V \u2282 Hn be an (n \u2212 1)dimensional CES spanned by |\u03a8i i (i = 1, . . . , k). Product vectors in V \u22a5 must obey the set of equations\nh\u03a8i |x, yi = 0 (i = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1), which, as we already\nknow, can be rewritten as\n\nhu, v \u2217 |Q\u0393 \u2212 \u01ebP\u03c6 |u, v \u2217 i = hu, v|Q|u, vi \u2212 \u01eb|h\u03c6|u, v \u2217 i|2\n2\n\n\u2217\n\nB(x)|yi = 0,\n\n(31)\n\n2\n\n= \u03bbm |h\u03a8m |u, ui| \u2212 \u01eb|h\u03c6|u, v i|\n= \u03bbm |u|4 \u2212 \u01eb|a1 u0 u\u2217 + (a2 + a3 + . . . + an\u2212m+2 )u\u22170 u|2 ,\n(29)\nwhere we denoted u = u1 + * * * + um\u22121 . The second equality is a consequence of the fact that |ui|vi is orthogonal\nto |\u03a8i i (i = 1, . . . , m \u2212 1) and |\u03a6i i (i = m, . . . , n \u2212 1),\nwhile the third one stems from the fact that h\u03a8m |u, ui =\n(u1 + * * * + um\u22121 )2 = u2 .\nFor simplicity, let us now put u0 = 1 and denote a =\na2 + * * * + an\u2212m+2 . Then, Eq. (29) can be rewritten as\n\nwith the |xi-dependent (n \u2212 1) \u00d7 n matrix B(x). For further benefit, let us denote by \u03a0V the projector onto V\nand by \u03a0V (x) a local projection of \u03a0V onto |xi \u2208 Cn ,\nthat is, \u03a0V (x) = Tr[(|xihx| \u2297 1)\u03a0V ]. Analogously, |\u03a8(x)i\nstands for the local projection of some composite vector\n|\u03a8i \u2208 Hn onto |xi \u2208 Cn . In both cases, for concreteness,\nwe always project at the first subsystem.\nNow we are prepared to prove the following theorem.\nTheorem 1. Consider an (n \u2212 1)-dimensional subspace\nV \u2282 Hn possessing the following properties:\n\nhu, v \u2217 |Q\u0393 \u2212 \u01ebP\u03c6 |u, v \u2217 i = \u03bbm |\u03b7|4 \u2212 \u01eb|a1 \u03b7 + a\u03b7 \u2217 |2\n\u0011\n\u0010\n2\n,\n(30)\n= |\u03b7|2 \u03bbm |\u03b7|2 \u2212 \u01eb a1 + ae\u22122i\u03b4\n\n1. Local projection of \u03a0V onto at least one vector\n|xi \u2208 Cn gives a full-rank density matrix of the\nother subsystem.\n\nwhere the second equality follows from the fact that we\ncan always write \u03b7 = |\u03b7|ei\u03b4 . Clearly, we can always choose\n\u03b4 such that |a1 + ae\u22122i\u03b4 | > 0 and then, taking sufficiently\nsmall |\u03b7|, we can make hu, v \u2217 |Q\u0393 \u2212 \u01ebP\u03c6 |u, v \u2217 i negative for\nany \u01eb > 0.\nEventually, let us observe that the same reasoning applied when P is any positive matrix supported on K.\nConcluding Q given by Eq. (27) gives rise to an optimal\ndecomposable witness such that the corresponding PW\ndoes not span Hm,n .\n\n2. The subspace V cannot be embedded in any V1 \u2297 V2 ,\nwhere Vi or V2 is a proper subspace of Cn .\nThen PV spans the whole Hn .\nProof. Assume that V is spanned by the the following\northonormal vectors:\n|\u03a8i i =\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\nk,l=0\n\n(i)\n\nakl |ki|li (i = 0, . . . , n \u2212 1).\n\n(32)\n\n\f7\nAs before, Ai (i = 0, . . . , n \u2212 1) are square matrices corresponding to |\u03a8i i, that is, matrices formed from the\n(i)\nnumbers akl .\nProduct vectors in V \u22a5 are solutions to the system of\nequations (31). Assume now that for some |xi \u2208 Cn\nthe matrix B(x) is of full rank, and denote by Mi (x)\n(n = 0, . . . , n \u2212 1) the matrices obtained by removing the\nith column from B(x). Then this system has a unique\nsolution (and the corresponding product vector in V \u22a5 )\ngiven by |y(x)i = [y0 (x), . . . , yn\u22121 (x)] with yi (x) being\nthe determinant of Mi (x), that is,\nyi (x) = det Mi (x)\n\n(i = 0, . . . , n \u2212 1).\n\n(33)\n\nNow, let us notice that B(x) is of full rank iff \u03a0V (x)\nis. This is because\nX\n|\u03a8i (x)ih\u03a8i (x)|,\n(34)\n\u03a0V (x) =\ni\n\nand, clearly, \u03a0V (x) is of full rank iff all the vectors |\u03a8i (x)i\n(i = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1) are linearly independent. Since |\u03a8i (x)i\nare just rows of B(x), we infer that B(x) is of full rank\niff \u03a0V (x) is.\nThe first assumption, together with the above fact, tell\nus that there exists a vector |xi \u2208 Cn such that B(x) is of\nfull rank. Let |x0 i denote such a vector. Consequently one\nof the matrices Mi (x) has nonvanishing determinant at\n|x0 i. On the other hand, by the very definition, yi (x) is a\nhomogenous polynomial in coordinates of |xi. Since then\nyi (x) does not vanish at at least one x, it cannot be identically equal zero. As, moreover, the equation yi (x) = 0\nhas solutions only in the set of Lebegue's measure zero,\nthe matrix B(x) is of full rank for almost all |xi \u2208 Cn .\nIn other words, the system (31) has a unique solution\nfor almost all |xis given by Eqs. (33). For the remaining\n|xis, it has at least a two-dimensional subspace of solutions; however, in such cases Eqs. (33) give us a zero\nvector. Nevertheless, the set of product vectors |xi|y(x)i\nwith |y(x)i given by Eqs. (33) is enough to span, after\nbeing partially conjugated, the Hilbert space Hn . For convenience, let us denote these solutions by C and their\npartial conjugations by C \u2217 .\nNotice that the above reasoning holds when we exchange the subsystems, that is, for almost all |yi \u2208 Cn there\nexist |xi \u2208 Cn such that y is the unique (up to a scalar)\nsolution of Eq. (31).\nBecause the polynomial formulas (33) for coordinates\nof the solution of Eq. (31) produce almost all vectors |yi\nfrom Cn , the polynomials (33) are linearly independent.\nIt remains to prove that the vectors from C \u2217 , (i.e.,\nvectors |xi \u2297 |y(x\u2217 )i) span Cn \u2297 Cn . To this end, observe\nthat |yi is defined by n linearly independent polynomials\nof variables x\u22170 , . . . , x\u2217n\u22121 . Moreover, they are linearly\nindependent of the polynomials x0 , . . . , xn\u22121 (no x\u2217i can\nbe achieved by a combination of xi s so also no yi\u2217 ). It\nimplies, that the coordinates of |xi \u2297 |y(x\u2217 )i form a\nset of n2 linearly independent polynomials, so the set\n{|xi \u2297 |y(x\u2217 )i : |xi \u2208 Cn \u2227 rankB(x) = n \u2212 1} spans\n\nthe whole Cn \u2297 Cn . \u0003\nRemark 1. Any subspace W in Cn \u2297 Cn of dimension\nless than n \u2212 1, which can be extended to (n \u2212 1)dimensional subspace (which we show to be the case in\nLemma 2), satisfying the assumptions of the theorem,\ninherits the property of spanning from V . Indeed, all\nproduct vectors orthogonal to V are orthogonal to W ,\nso already a subset of product vectors orthogonal to W\nspans the whole Cn \u2297 Cn after partial conjugation.\nRemark 2. It should be noticed that for any CES in H2,n\nthe first assumption of the theorem is always obeyed. In\norder to see it explicitly, let us write the orthonormal\nvectors spanning such CES as\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\n|\u03a8i i = |0i|\u03a80 i + |1i|\u03a81 i\n\n(i = 1, . . . , dimV ) (35)\n\nAssume now that in this case the local projection of \u03a0V\nis rank deficient for any |xi \u2208 C2 . Taking the vector\n|xi = |0i, the matrix \u03a0V (x) is just a sum of projections\n(i)\nonto |\u03a80 i. Since here \u03a0V (x) is not of full rank, the vec(i)\ntors |\u03a80 i must be linearly dependent. This, however,\nimmediately implies that there is a product vector in V\nwhich contradicts the assumption that V is CES.\nNow, let us show that for any three-dimensional CES\nsupported in H4 , the first assumption of the theorem is\nsatisfied.\nLemma 1. Let V be a three-dimensional CES supported\nin C4 \u2297 C4 . Then there exist |xi \u2208 C4 such that the\nmatrix B(x) is of rank 3.\nProof. Assume in contrary that for any |xi \u2208 C4 the matrix B(x) is of rank 2 or lower. Notice that rows of B(x)\nare just vectors |\u03a8i i (i = 1, 2, 3) spanning V projected\nlocally on |xi (henceforward denoted by |\u03a8i (x)i). Also,\nin what follows, we denote by |z \u2032 i and |z \u2032\u2032 i the |zi \u2208 C4\nprojected onto span{|1i, |2i, |3i} and span{|0i, |2i, |3i},\nrespectively.\nLet us start the proof by noting that in C4 \u2297 C4 the\nlargest subspace with all vectors having Schmidt rank 4\nis one-dimensional (see, e.g., Refs. [21\u201323]). Therefore, we\ncan assume that one of the vectors spanning our CES V ,\nsay |\u03a81 i, has Schmidt rank either 2 or 3. As the proof is\nstraightforward but tedious, in what follows we consider\nonly the first case; however, analogous reasoning works\nalso for the case of Schmidt rank 3.\nBy local unitary operations, we can always bring |\u03a81 i\nto |\u03a81 i = |00i + |11i, while the remaining two vectors\ntake the general forms\n|\u03a82 i = |0i|\u03c80 i + |1i|\u03c81 i + |2i|\u03c82 i + |3i|\u03c83 i\n|\u03a83 i = |0i|\u03c60 i + |1i|\u03c61 i + |2i|\u03c62 i + |3i|\u03c63 i\n\n(36)\n\nOur proving strategy is that we consider vectors |\u03a8i (x)i\n(i = 1, 2, 3) for some particular subsets of vectors of C4 .\nThen, demanding that all the 3 \u00d7 3 submatrices of the\n\n\f8\n3 \u00d7 4 matrix B(x) have zero determinant, we show that\nV is not either a CES or supported in H4 .\nWe start by noting that the above procedure for |xi =\n|0i and |xi = |1i leads us to a conclusion that the sets\n{|0i, |\u03c80 i, |\u03c60 i} and {|1i, |\u03c81 i, |\u03c61 i} must be linearly dependent. This means that by taking appropriate linear\ncombinations of |\u03a8i i (i = 1, 2, 3), the vectors spanning V\ncan be expressed as\n|\u03a81 i = |00i + |11i\n|\u03a82 i = |0i|\u03c80 i + |2i|\u03c82 i + |3i|\u03c83 i\n|\u03a83 i = |1i|\u03c61 i + |2i|\u03c62 i + |3i|\u03c63 i,\n\n(37)\n\nwhere, in general, vectors |\u03c8i i and |\u03c6i i are different than\nthe ones appearing in Eq. (36). However, for convenience,\nwe do not change the notation.\nIn what follows, we split the proof into two cases, that\nis, when both vectors |\u03c80 i and |\u03c61 i are nonzero and one\nof them vanishes.\nThe case of nonzero |\u03c80 i and |\u03c61 i. By choosing |xi =\n(1, \u03b1, 0, 0) (\u03b1 \u2208 C) and demanding that the corresponding matrix B(x) is of rank at most 2 (i.e., that all\nthe 3 \u00d7 3 determinants of this matrix vanish), we get\nthe conditions that either |\u03c80 i k |\u03c61 i or |\u03c80 i, |\u03c61 i \u2208\nspan{|0i, |1i}.\nIn both cases, we can assume that either |\u03c80 i \u2226 |0i\nor |\u03c61 i \u2226 |1i because otherwise one can remove |\u03c80 i or\n|\u03c61 i from the vectors (37) by taking appropriate linear\ncombinations of |\u03a8i i (i = 1, 2, 3), leading us to the case\nconsidered below. Let us then assume that |\u03c80 i \u2226 |0i,\nwhich in particular means that |\u03c80\u2032 i =\n6 0.\nNow, we project onto |xi = (1, 0, \u03b1, \u03b2) (\u03b1 \u2208 C), which\nallows us to conclude that |\u03c80\u2032 i has to be parallel to all\nthe vectors of |\u03c8i\u2032 i and |\u03c6\u2032i i (i = 2, 3) which are nonzero, unless |\u03c6\u20322 i = 0 and |\u03c6\u20323 i = 0. In the former case, one immediately finds that V is not supported in\nH1 . This is because either |\u03c80 i is proportional to |\u03c61 i,\nmeaning that |\u03c80\u2032 i k |\u03c6\u20321 i k |\u03c82\u2032 i k |\u03c6\u20322 i k |\u03c83\u2032 i k |\u03c6\u20323 i\nand therefore V \u2286 C4 \u2297 span{|0i, |1i, |\u03c80\u2032 i}, or when\n|\u03c80 i, |\u03c61 i \u2208 span{|0i, |1i}, the vectors |\u03c80\u2032 i and |\u03c8i\u2032 i and\n|\u03c6i i (i = 2, 3) are parallel and hence V \u2286 C4 \u2297 C2 .\nIn the case when |\u03c6\u20322 i = 0 and |\u03c6\u20323 i = 0, we notice that it cannot happen that |\u03c62 i = |\u03c63 i = 0 because in such case there exists a product vector |1i|\u03c61 i in\nV . Therefore, one of the vectors |\u03c62 i or |\u03c63 i is proportional to |0i. We project further onto |xi = (0, 1, \u03b1, \u03b2)\n(\u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 C), which, in the same way as before, leads us\nto the additional conditions that |\u03c82\u2032\u2032 i k |\u03c83\u2032\u2032 i|0i, and\nso |\u03c82 i, |\u03c83 i \u2208 span{|0i, |1i}. Then all vectors |\u03c8i i and\n|\u03c6i i (i = 2, 3) live in span{|0i, |1i}. Consequently, irrespectively of whether |\u03c80 i is proportional to |\u03c61 i or\n|\u03c80 i, |\u03c61 i \u2208 {|0i, |1i}, V is not supported in H4 .\nThe case when one of the vectors |\u03c80 i, |\u03c61 i vanishes.\nWithout any loss of generality we can assume that |\u03c61 i =\n0. This immediately implies that one of the vectors |\u03c6\u20322 i\nor |\u03c6\u20323 i is nonzero because otherwise |\u03a83 i = |\u03c9i|0i for\nsome |\u03c9i \u2208 C4 , meaning that there is a product vector\nin V .\n\nWe now project locally |\u03a8i i (i = 1, 2, 3) onto |xi =\n(1, 0, \u03b1, \u03b2) (\u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 C). Demanding that the resulting matrix B(x) is of rank less than or equal to 2, we get the condition that if |\u03c80\u2032 i is nonzero the vectors |\u03c8i\u2032 i (i = 0, 2, 3)\nand |\u03c6\u2032i i (i = 2, 3) are parallel (excluding the ones that\npossibly vanish). As a result, V is a subspace supported\non C4 \u2297 span{|0i, |1i, |\u03c80\u2032 i}.\nIf, on the other hand, |\u03c80\u2032 i = 0 (|\u03c80\u2032 i k |0i), one gets\nthe conditions that either |\u03c6\u20322 i = \u03b7|\u03c82\u2032 i and |\u03c6\u20323 i = \u03b7|\u03c83\u2032 i\nor |\u03c82\u2032 i k |\u03c6\u20322 i k |\u03c83\u2032 i k |\u03c6\u20323 i (again excluding the vectors\nthat vanish). In the first of these cases, we can subtract\n|\u03a83 i from |\u03a82 i obtaining a product vector in V , while\nin the second case, again V is supported on a subspace\nC4 \u2297 span{|0i, |1i, |\u03c82\u2032 i}, leading to a contradiction with\none of the assumptions.\nNow let us consider the case when one of the vectors is\nof Schmidt rank 3 and there is no vector of Schmidt rank\n2 in the CES V . The vectors spanning V can be written\nin this case as\n|\u03a81 i = |00i + |11i + |22i,\n|\u03a82 i = |0i|\u03c80 i + |2i|\u03c82 i + |3i|\u03c83 i,\n|\u03a83 i = |1i|\u03c61 i + |2i|\u03c62 i + |3i|\u03c63 i,\n\n(38)\n\nwhere the sets {|\u03c80 i, |\u03c82 i, |\u03c83 i} and {|\u03c61 i, |\u03c62 i, |\u03c63 i} are\nlinearly independent (otherwise the Schmidt rank of |\u03a82 i\nor |\u03a83 i would be less than 3). In particular, none of these\nsix vectors can be zero.\nChoosing |xi = (1, 0, 0, \u03b1) and |xi = (0, 1, 0, \u03b1) (\u03b1 \u2208\nC), one gets that |\u03c80\u2032 i k |\u03c83\u2032 i k |\u03c6\u20323 i or |\u03c6\u20323 i = 0 and\n|\u03c6\u2032\u20321 i k |\u03c83\u2032\u2032 i k |\u03c6\u2032\u20323 i or |\u03c83\u2032\u2032 i = 0. This gives us four cases:\n(i) |\u03c80\u2032 i k |\u03c83\u2032 i k |\u03c6\u20323 i and |\u03c6\u2032\u20321 i k |\u03c83\u2032\u2032 i k |\u03c6\u2032\u20323 i, (ii) |\u03c80\u2032 i k\n|\u03c83\u2032 i k |\u03c6\u20323 i and |\u03c83\u2032\u2032 i = 0, (iii) |\u03c6\u2032\u20321 i k |\u03c83\u2032\u2032 i k |\u03c6\u2032\u20323 i and\n|\u03c6\u20323 i = 0, and (iv) |\u03c6\u20323 i = 0 and |\u03c83\u2032\u2032 i = 0 (i.e., |\u03c63 i k |0i\nand |\u03c83 i k |1i).\nIn the first case, we project onto (1, \u03b1, 0, 0) (\u03b1 \u2208 C),\nwhich gives us additional conditions that either |\u03c80 i k\n|\u03c61 i or |\u03c80 i, |\u03c61 i \u2208 span{|0i, |1i}. In the first of these two\npossibilities, we can additionally assume that |\u03c80\u2032 i \u2226 |1i\nbecause otherwise we fall into the second possibility. This\nimplies that in particular |\u03c80 i k |\u03c83 i, meaning that |\u03a82 i\nis of Schmidt rank 2.\nIn the case when |\u03c80 i, |\u03c61 i \u2208 span{|0i, |1i}, we easily\nfind that |\u03c80 i, |\u03c61 i, |\u03c83 i, |\u03c63 i \u2208 span{|0i, |1i}. Projecting\nfurther onto (0, 0, 1, \u03b1) (\u03b1 \u2208 C) and after careful analysis,\none arrives at the conclusion that again one of the vectors\nspanning V is of Schmidt rank 2.\nLet us now come to the cases (ii) and (iii). As they\nare analogous, for simplicity we consider only the first of\nthem. The corresponding conditions imply that |\u03c80 i k |1i\nand |\u03c80 i, |\u03c63 i \u2208 span{|0i, |1i}. Then, it suffices to project onto |xi = (1, \u03b1, 0, 0) (\u03b1 \u2208 C) to see that |\u03c61 i \u2208\nspan{|0i, |1i}, meaning that we fall into the already discussed case when |\u03c80 i, |\u03c61 i, |\u03c83 i, |\u03c63 i \u2208 span{|0i, |1i}\n(see above).\nLet us consider the case (iv) and project, for instance, onto |xi = (1, 0, \u03b1, 0) (\u03b1 \u2208 C). This, in particular,\nimposes the conditions that |\u03c80\u2032 i k |\u03c6\u20322 i or |\u03c6\u20322 i = 0. In\n\n\f9\nthe latter case, |\u03c62 i k |\u03c63 i k |0i and one sees immediately that |\u03a83 i is of Schmidt rank at most 2. Assume then\nthat |\u03c80\u2032 i k |\u03c6\u20322 i and recall that either |\u03c80 i and |\u03c61 i are\nparallel or they both live in span{|0i, |1i}. This implies\nthat either |\u03c6\u20321 i k |\u03c6\u20322 i or |\u03c61 i, |\u03c62 i \u2208 span{|0i, |1i}. In\nthe first case, |\u03a83 i \u2208 C4 \u2297 span{|0i, \u03c6\u20321 }, while in the\nsecond one |\u03a83 i \u2208 C4 \u2297 span{|0i, |1i}. Hence, both cases\nare of rank at most 2. This completes the proof. \u0003\nFinally, let us follow Remark 1 and prove that any\nCES in Hn of dimension less than n \u2212 1 is a subspace of\nthe (n \u2212 1)-dimensional CES. For this purpose, we prove\na bit more general fact.\nLemma 2. Any r-dimensional CES in Hm,n with\nr < (m + 1)(n + 1) is a subspace of an (r + 1)dimensional CES.\nProof. Let V \u2282 Hm,n denote an r-dimensional CES and\nMV denoet a set constructed from linear combinations of\nvectors from V and all product vectors from Hm,n , that\nis,\nMV = {|\u03a8i + |ei \u2297 |f i | |\u03a8i \u2208 V, |ei \u2208 Cn , |f i \u2208 Cm }.\n(39)\nWe start by noting that V can be extended to some\n(r + 1)-dimensional CES, denoted V2 , if MV ( Hm,n .\nThis is because if the set MV is a proper subset of Hm,n ,\nwe can take a vector |\u03a8i \u2208 Hm,n which does not belong\nto MV and define the subspace V2 as a linear hull of that\nvector and V . The construction of MV guarantees that\nV2 is CES because otherwise |\u03a8i can be written as a linear combination of a vector from V and a product vector\nfrom V2 . Consequently, |\u03a8i has to be in MV , contradicting the assumption that |\u03a8i 6\u2208 MV .\nLet us now show that for any CES of nonmaximal dimension [dim V < (n \u2212 1)(m \u2212 1)] the set MV is not the\nwhole Cn \u2297Cm . For this purpose, observe first that MV is\na manifold. Every its element can be represented as a sum\nof an element from (n + m \u2212 1)-dimensional manifold of\nseparable vectors from Hm,n and the r-dimensional CES\nV , and hence the dimension of MV is less or equal to\nr + n + m \u2212 1. Therefore, for any r < (m \u2212 1)(n \u2212 1),\nthe dimension of MV is less than mn, meaning that\nMV ( Hm,n . Consequently, V can be extended to an\n(r + 1)-dimensional CES. \u0003\nBy repeating the above procedure until r = (m\u22121)(n\u2212\n1) we see that every CES of a nonmaximal dimension in\nHm,n is a subspace of some maximally dimensional CES.\nIn conclusion, we see, via theorem 1 and both the\nabove lemmas, that all completely entangled subspaces\nof H4 of dimension less than or equal to 3 have the\nproperty of spanning. This, by virtue of the previous\ndiscussion, proves the following theorem.\nTheorem 2. Let W be a decomposable witness acting on\nH4 . Then, the following statements are equivalent:\n(i): W = Q\u0393 , Q - 0, r(Q) \u00ac 3, and supp(Q) is a CES\nsupported in H4 ,\n\n(ii): PW spans H4 ,\n(iii): W is optimal.\nCollecting together results obtained for H2 and H3 in\nRef. [14] and the above one for H4 , it is tempting to\nconjecture that any CES V such that dimV \u00ac n \u2212 1\nsupported in Hn has the property of spanning. In other\nwords, we conjecture that Theorem 2 holds for any DEW\n(5) from Mn as long as r(Q) \u00ac n \u2212 1.\nInterestingly, it is easy to disprove this conjecture for\nsystems of unequal local dimensions. For this purpose, let\nus consider the subspace of Hm,n with n > m, spanned\nby the following vectors:\n|\u03a8i i = |0i|ii \u2212 |ii|0i\n(i = 1, . . . , m \u2212 1)\n|\u03a8i i = |0i|ii \u2212 |1i|i \u2212 1i\n(i = m, . . . , n \u2212 2)\n|\u03a8n\u22121 i = |0i|n \u2212 1i \u2212 |\u03c8ant i,\n(40)\nwhere |\u03c8ant i is a state from the antisymmetric subspace\nof Cm \u2297 Cm orthogonal to all |\u03a8i i (i = 1, . . . , m \u2212 1).\nNotice that in the case n = m + 1, one omits the second\ngroup of vectors.\nUsing the matrix representation of the above vectors\nand applying analogous reasoning as in the Appendix,\nn\u22121\none finds that V = span{|\u03a8i i}i=1\nis a (n\u22121)-dimensional\nsubspace supported in Hm,n which does not contain any\nproduct vectors. Then, there are two classes of product\nvectors orthogonal to this subspace, that is,\n(1, x1 , . . . , xm\u22121 ) \u2297 (y0 , . . . , yn\u22122 , 0)\n\n(41)\n\n(0, x1 , . . . , xm\u22121 ) \u2297 |yi,\n\n(42)\n\nand\n\nwhere now |yi can be arbitrary. Let us now take partial\nconjugations of both classes. Clearly, the product vector\n|0i|n \u2212 1i is orthogonal to both of them and therefore the\nabove subspace does not have the property of spanning.\nTo illustrate the above construction with an example, let\nus consider the case of H3,4 . The above construction gives\nV = span{|01i \u2212 |10i, |02i \u2212 |20i, |03i \u2212 (|12i \u2212 |21i)}. The\nproduct vectors orthogonal to V are given by (1, x1 , x2 )\u2297\n(y0 , y1 , y2 , 0) (x1 , x2 , y0 , y1 , y2 \u2208 C) and (0, x1 , x2 ) \u2297 |yi\n(x1 , x2 \u2208 C, |yi \u2208 C4 ). The vector orthogonal to partial\nconjugations of both classes is |0i|3i.\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nLet us here shortly summarize the obtained results and\noutline the possibilities for further research.\nBecause entanglement witnesses are very useful tools\nin quantum information theory, their characterization is\nof great interest. Particularly important in this context\nis the notion of optimality introduced in Ref. [10].\nVery recently, some of us have studied decomposable\nwitnesses detecting entanglement in qubit-qunit systems\nand provided a complete characterization of optimality\n\n\f10\nin this case [14]. In the present paper we have treated\nseveral questions that arise in other finite-dimensional\nHilbert spaces. One of the most interesting problems is\nwhether optimal decomposable witnesses exist such that\nthe corresponding PW s do not span the Hilbert space.\nHere we answer this question positively by showing that\nfor any Hilbert space Hm,n with m, n - 3 there exist\noptimal DEWs without the property of spanning.\nAiming at the generalization of the results of Ref. [14],\nwe have tried to distinguish all the CESs for which the\ncorresponding PV s do span Hm,n . This tells us for which\nDEWs of form (5) the implications (i) and (ii) (see Sec.\nII) become equivalences. We have proven that under a\ncertain condition, which is conjectured to be always satisfied, all (n\u22121)-dimensional CESs supported in Hn have\nthe property of spanning. This result obviously extends\nto any CES being a proper subspace of such an (n \u2212 1)dimensional CES supported in two-qunit Hilbert space. We have proven that any r-dimensional CES can be\nextended to an (r + 1)-dimensional one, meaning that all\nCESs in Hn of a dimension less than n \u2212 1 are subspaces of (n \u2212 1)-dimensional CESs. We have applied this\nstatements to the two-ququart case and shown that any\nCES of dimension dimV \u00ac 3 supported in H4 has the\nproperty of spanning. This, together with the results obtained in Ref. [14], allows us to conjecture that any CES\nof dimension less than or equal to n \u2212 1 and supported\nin Hn has this property. Certainly this conjecture cannot\nhold if the local dimensions are different, as we provide\nexamples of (n \u2212 1)-dimensional subspaces without the\nproperty of spanning supported in Hm,n (3 \u00ac m < n).\nClearly, still much has to be done to complete the characterization of witnesses. In particular, it remains to prove the above conjecture and determine whether all CESs\nof Hm,n (m, n - 3) have the property of spanning. This\nwould allow to find all the instances when (i) and (ii)\n(see Sec. II) are equivalences. The more challenging task,\nhowever, would be to ask a similar question in the case\nof indecomposable witnesses.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nDiscussions with Seung-Hyeok Kye, Pawe\u0142 Mazurek,\n\u0141ukasz Skowronek, and Julia Stasi\u0144ska are gratefully acknowledged.

Precisely, to any vector Hm,n \u220b |\u03c8i = ij aij |iji there cor-\n\nrespond a complex m \u00d7 n matrix A =\nvice versa).\n\n1.\n\nP\n\nij\n\naij |iihj| (and\n\nThe symmetric case\n\nWe consider an m-dimensional subspace V in Cm \u2297Cm\nspanned by vectors:\n|\u03a8i i = |0i|ii \u2212 |ii|0i\n\n(i = 1, . . . , m \u2212 1),\n\nand a vector |\u03a8m i \u2208 span(|1i, . . . , |m \u2212 1i)\u22972 .\nWe prove that the only product vector in this subspace\nis zero. For this purpose, let us take a linear combination\nof all vectors spanning V , which, in terms of the above\nvector-matrix correspondence, reads\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n0\n\u03b11 . . .\n\u03b1m\u22121\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef \u2212\u03b11\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n(A1)\n..\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\nem\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fb\n\u03b1m A\n.\n\u2212\u03b1m\u22121\nwhere r(Am ) > 1. There exists a product vector in V iff\nthere exist nonzero \u03b1s such that the above matrix is of\nrank 1.\nFirst observe that |\u03a8m i affects neither the first column nor the first row of (A1). The principal minors\nof the matrix (A1) formed by the sets of indices {0, i},\ni \u2208 {1, m \u2212 1} are then equal \u03b121 , . . . , \u03b12m\u22121 . If the matrix\nis to be of rank 1, all of them have to be zero, which\nimplies that \u03b11 = * * * = \u03b1m\u22121 = 0. The last coefficient\n\u03b1m has also to be zero, because r(Am ) > 1. This finishes\nthe proof.\n\n2.\n\nThe general case\n\nNow we consider an n-dimensional subspace in Cm \u2297Cn\nspanned by vectors |\u03a8i i (i = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1) given by Eqs.\n(7) and (18), but in this case the vector |\u03a8m i is fixed and\ndefined by (15). The combination matrix has the form\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\u03b11 . . .\n\u03b1m\u22121 \u03b1m+1 \u03b1m+2 . . . \u03b1n\n0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef \u2212\u03b11\nx\n\u2212\u03b1m+2 . . . \u03b1n 0 \uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa,\n..\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8f0\n\u03b1 A\n0\n... ... 0 \uf8fb\n.\nm\n\n\u2212\u03b1m\u22121\n\nm\n\n0\n\n...\n\n...\n\n0\n(A2)\n\nwhere x = \u03b1m a0,m\u22122 \u2212 \u03b1m+1 .\nAgain, by calculating the principal minors of the combination matrix formed by the sets of indices {0, i},\ni \u2208 {1, m \u2212 1}, one gets \u03b10 = * * * = \u03b1m\u22122 = 0. The block\nformed by the last m \u2212 1 rows and the columns of indices\n1, . . . m \u2212 1 is affected by |\u03a8m i and |\u03a8m+1 i, but always\nhas rank m \u2212 1 if only \u03b1m 6= 0, so \u03b1m = 0. Now only\nthe two first rows are nonzero in the combination matrix.\nWe consider minors of size 2 formed by these rows and\n\n\f11\ncolumns of indices i \u2212 1, i. Starting with i = m + 1, one\ngets \u03b12m+1 = 0. Taking i = m + 2, one gets \u03b12m+2 = 0. In\n\nthis manner, one can show that \u03b1m+1 = * * * = \u03b1n = 0,\ncompleting the proof.\n\n[1] R.
