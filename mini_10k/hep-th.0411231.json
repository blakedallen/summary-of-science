It describes N identical particles on the line\nwhich interact through an inverse-square two-body interaction and are subjected to\na common confining harmonic force. Starting from the inception more than thirty\nyears ago, the model and its various descedants continue to be of interest for both\nphysics and mathematics community, primarly because they are connected with a\nnumber of mathematical and physical problems, ranging from random matrices and\n1\n\ne-mail: meljanac@irb.hr\ne-mail: marijan@phy.hr\n3\ne-mail: andjelo.samsarov@irb.hr\n2\n\n1\n\n\fsymmetric polynomials [2] to condensed matter systems [3], black hole physics [4]\nand 2D strings [5].\nThe Calogero model is defined by the following Hamiltonian (i, j = 1, 2, ...N):\nh\u03042 X \u2202i2\n1\nm\u03c9 2 X 2 h\u03042 \u03bd(\u03bd \u2212 1) X\nH=\u2212\nxi +\n,\n+\n2\n2\n2m i \u2202xi\n2 i\n2m\ni6=j (xi \u2212 xj )\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03bd(\u03bd \u2212 1) \u2265 \u22121/4 is the dimensionless coupling constant, m is the mass of\nparticles and \u03c9 is the strength of a harmonic confinement potential. The ground\nstate of the Hamiltonian (1) is of the well-known, highly correlated, Jastrow form\n\u03a80 (x1 , x2 , * * * xN ) =\n\nY\n\ni<j\n\nm\u03c9\n\n|xi \u2212 xj |\u03bd e\u2212 2h\u0304\n\nP\n\ni\n\nx2i\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nwith corresponding ground state energy, which depends on \u03bd explicitly\n!\n\n\u03bdN(N \u2212 1)\nN\n.\n+\nE0 = \u03c9\n2\n2\n\n(3)\n\nOne can exactly solve this model and find out the complete set of energy eigenvalues\neither by following the traditional approach [1] or by employing its underlying SN\n(permutational) algebraic structure [6]. The later (operator) approach is considerably simpler than the original one, yields an explicit expression for the wavefunctions and emphasizes the interpretation in terms of generalized statistics. Namely,\nthe inverse-square potential can be regarded as a pure statistical interaction and the\nmodel maps to an ideal gas of particles obeying fractional Haldane statistics [7], with\ncoupling constant \u03bd playing the role of Haldane statistical parameter. In Haldane's\nformulation, however, there is the possibility of having particles of different species\nwith a mutual statistical parameter depending on the species coupled. This suggests\nthe generalization of the single-species Calogero model to the multispecies Calogero\nmodel. Distinguishability of the species can be introduced by allowing particles to\nhave different masses and different couplings to each other. The novel feature of\n1D multispecies Calogero model is appearance of the long-range three-body interaction. Under certain conditions this three-body interaction can be eliminated from\nthe Hamiltonian (but only in 1D!).\nFurther generalization of Calogero model (1) can be achieved by formulating\nthe model in dimensions higher than one. In a case of a single-species model in D\ndimensions, some exact eigenstates (including the ground state) are known but the\ncomplete solution of the problem is still lacking. Some progress has been achieved\nonly recently for a class of 2D models [8]. Usually, the inevitable appearance of the\nthree-body interaction in D > 1 is the main obstacle which makes any analysis of\nsuch a model(s) highly nontrivial.\n2\n\n\fThe aim of the present article is to present and discuss some aspects of the\nmodel which incorporates both generalizations mentioned above. In Sec.2 we define\na multispecies Calogero model in D dimensions. We succeeded in finding a class of,\nbut not all, exact eigenstates of the model Hamiltonian which corresponded to global\ncollective states. The analysis relied heavily on the SU(1,1) algebraic structure of\nthe Hamiltonian and utilized Fock space representation. In Sec.3 we briefly discuss\nsome other interesting features of the model. We rewrite the Hamiltonian in a simple\nform and comment on universal critical point. Section 4 is concluding section.\n\n2\n\nA model Hamiltonian: some exact eigenstates\nand eigenenergies\n\nFollowing the lines of reasoning already sketched in Introduction, we define the most\ngeneral Calogero-type Hamiltonian in D dimensions [9], describing N distinguishable\nCalogero-like particles which interact with two-body and three-body interactions, as\n( we put h\u0304 = 1 and i, j = 1, 2, ...N)\nH=\u2212\n\n1 X 1 ~ 2 \u03c92 X\n1 X \u03bdij (\u03bdij + D \u2212 2) 1\n1\n\u2207i +\nmi~ri2 +\n(\n+\n)+\n2\n2 i mi\n2 i\n2 i<j\nmi mj\n|~ri \u2212 ~rj |\n+\n\n1 X \u03bdij \u03bdik (~ri \u2212 ~rj )(~ri \u2212 ~rk )\n.\n2 i6=j,i6=k mi |~ri \u2212 ~rj |2 |~ri \u2212 ~rk |2\n\n(4)\n\nHere, mi are masses of the particles, \u03c9 is the frequency of the harmonic potential\nand \u03bdij = \u03bdji are the statistical parameters between particles i and j.\nIt can be shown that the ground state \u03a80 , obeying H\u03a80 = E0 \u03a80 , is of generalized\nJastrow form (2)\n\u03a80 (~r1 , ..., ~rN ) =\n\nY\n\ni<j\n\n\u03c9\n\n|~ri \u2212 ~rj |\u03bdij e\u2212 2\n\nP\n\ni\n\nmi ~\nri2\n\n\u03c9\n\n\u2261 \u2206e\u2212 2\n\nP\n\ni\n\nmi ~\nri2\n\n(5)\n\nand the ground state energy E0 generalizes Calogero result (3)\nE0 = \u03c9(\n\nND X\n\u03bdij ) \u2261 \u03c9\u01eb0\n+\n2\ni<j\n\n(6)\n\nNotice that for \u03bdij = \u03bd, mi = m and D 6= 1 Eq.(5) smoothly goes to exact ground\nstate of the Calogero-Marchioro model. For D = 1, the three-body term in (4)\nidentically vanish if \u03bdij = \u03bd and mi = m (single-species Calogero model [1]) or if\nthere exists a certain relation between masses and coupling constants, of the form\n\u03bdij = \u03b1mi mj (multispecies Calogero model [10]). This happens because identity\n3\n\n\f1\n(xi \u2212xj )(xi \u2212xk )\n\n= 0, which holds in 1D only. Unlike in one dimension, however, it\ndoes not vanish in higher dimensions (there is no analogouos identity for D 6= 1)\nand plays a crucial role in the analysis that is to follow.\nIn order to simplify the analysis, we perform the non-unitary transformation on \u03a80 ,\nnamely \u03a8\u03030 = \u2206\u22121 \u03a80 . It generates a similarity transformation which leads to an\nanother Hamiltonian H\u0303 = \u2206\u22121 H\u2206.

This means\nthat the relative coordinates, the relative momenta and the relative energy are all\nzero at this critical point. There survives only one oscillator, describing the motion of\nthe centre-of-mass. This critical point was first noticed by analysing Gram matrices\nof the scalar products of Fock-space states in ordinary Calogero model [11] and\nfurther confirmed by large-N collective field theory approach to the same model in\nRef.[12].\nFor the initial Hamiltonian (4), which is not unitary equivalent to H\u0303, the conditions\n(17,18) demand that some \u03bdij < 0 and, consequently, the norm of the wave function\n(5) blows up at the critical point. For \u03bdij negative but greater than the critical values\n(17,18), the wave function is singular at coincidence points but still quadratically\nintegrable.\n\n4\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, we have studied a non-trivial many-body Hamiltonian of Calogero type\nin D dimensions (4), with two- and three-body interactions among non-identical\nparticles. By applying the similarity transformation, we have obtained the simpler\nHamiltonian H\u0303 (7), on which we have performed the Fock-space analysis and found\nsome of its excited (collective) states (12) and their energies (13). The spectrum of\ncollective modes is linear, equidistant and degenerate. By splitting the Fock space\ninto the CM-Fock space and the R-Fock space (16) we have detected the universal\ncritical point (17,18) at which the system exhibits singular behaviour.\nUnfortunately, within our algebraic treatment, we are unable to construct the rest\n6\n\n\fof the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian (7) which parallel those in Calogero model\n(1). Therefore, the question of the full solvability of the model Hamiltonian (4) still\nremains open. Nevertheless, we hope that our analysis sheeds some light on the\nsuch kind of higher-dimensional models, that is the models with similar underlying\nconformal SU(1,1) symmetry.\nAcknowledgments\nOne of the authors (M.M.) would like to thank Prof. \u010c.
