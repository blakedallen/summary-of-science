These structures are formed by pairs\nof vertically stacked QDs with a thin barrier in between.\nBecause the constituent QDs are generally asymmetric, electric fields applied along the coupling direction\nare used to control the charge and the tunnel coupling\nstrength.3\u20136\nIn the last years, developement of QDMs formed by\nlaterally coupled QD pairs is also being pursued.7\u201312 In\nthese structures, the QD pair is formed inside the same\nepitaxial layers. This architecture is expected to offer\nsome advantages as compared to vertical QDMs.13,14 In\nparticular, independent control of QD charging and tunneling strength should be possible through the application of vertical and lateral electric fields, respectively.\nAlso, simultaneous coupling of multiple QDMs, which is a\nrequirement for the scaling of qubit operations, should be\nfeasible through the implementation of individual electric\ngates for each QDM. On the other hand, lateral QDMs\npresent their own obstacles. For example, the distance\nbetween the centers of the QDs is much larger than in\nvertical structures, which implies weaker tunneling. Indeed, despite recent advances in the electrical engineering of lateral QDMs, which include the demonstration\nof Coulomb blockade charging15\u201317 and tuning of optical\nresonances18, the application of lateral electric fields producing clear spectroscopic signatures of molecular coupling remains a challenge.\nUnderstanding the differences between the physics of\nlateral QDMs and the better known case of vertical\nQDMs will contribute to determine the conditions for\noptimal device performance, be it vertical, lateral or\nhybrid.19 Many of the differences arise from the distinct synthetic routes, which lead to characteristic structural and compositional profiles.18,20 Thus, in lateral\nQDMs it has been shown that the weaker quantum confinement of the QDs along the coupling direction leads\nto an enhanced role of the excited orbitals within the\nQDs.21,22 Also, the nonradiative relaxation dynamics of\nlateral InGaAs QDMs has been shown to follow a singu-\n\nlar path.20,23\nIn this paper, we study the optical resonances of neutral, negatively-charged and positively-charged excitons\nin lateral InGaAs QDMs as a function of the interdot\ndistance. The dots have slightly different energies, as is\noften the case with current growth techniques.7,9,15,16,18\nWe find that tunnel-coupling of trions is stronger than\nthat of neutral excitons. This leads to signatures in the\nphotoluminescence spectrum at zero electric field which\ncan be used to distinguish uncoupled QD pairs from coupled QDMs. The convenience of using trions instead of\nneutral excitons for quantum information protocols is discussed.\n\nII.\n\nTHEORETICAL MODEL\n\nOur Hamiltonian for excitons and trions can be written\nin the second quantization as:\n\n\u0124 =\n\nX\n\nEie e+\ni ei +\n\nX\np\n\ni\n\nEph h+\np hp +\n\n1X\n+\nhij| V |kli e+\ni ej ek el\n2\nijkl\n\nX\n1X\n+\n+\nhip| V |qji e+\nhpq| V |rsi h+\n+\np hq hr hs +\ni hp hq e j ,\n2 pqrs\nijpq\n(1)\nwhere Eie (Eph ) is the electron (hole) energy in the single+\nparticle state |ii (|pi), e+\ni /ei (hp /hp ) is the electron\n+\n(hole) creation/annihilation operator, i.e., (e+\ni ej . . .\n+ +\n)(hp hq . . . ) |0h i|0e i = |p q . . . i|i j . . . i, and hij| V |kli,\nhpq| V |rsi and hip| V |qji are the electron-electron, holehole and electron-hole Coulomb matrix elements respectively. Electron-hole exchange term is safely neglected\nbecause in the absence of magnetic fields and spin mixing, it has no effect on the observed emission spectrum.\nTo calculate the single-particle states, we use a twodimensional effective mass Hamiltonian for electrons and\nheavy holes:\n\n\u0124i =\n\n1\n(p2 + p2y ) + Vi (x, y),\n2 m\u2217i x\n\n(2)\n\n\f2\nwhere i = e, h is the index denoting electrons or holes,\nm\u2217 is the effective mass, p\u03b1 = \u2212ih\u0304\u2207\u03b1 the momentum\noperator, and V (x, y) the quantum confinement potential. For a pair of QDs whose centers are separated by a\ndistance d, V (x, y) is defined with intersecting parabolic\npotentials:\n\u0014\n\u0012\nd\n1 \u2217\n2\n((x + )2 + y 2 ),\nVi (x, y) = mi min \u03c9i,L\n2\n2\n\u0013\u0015\nd 2\n2\n2\n\u03c9i,R ((x \u2212 ) + y ) . (3)\n2\nHere \u03c9i,L (\u03c9i,R ) is the confinement frequency in the left\n(right) QD. A contour plot of this potential profile for\na slightly asymmetric QDM is shown in Figure 1. Similar models were previously adopted to study laterally\ncoupled QDs24,25 .\n\nFIG. 1. (Color online). Contour plot of the confinement potential for slightly asymmetric, laterally coupled QDs with an\ninterdot distance d=40 nm.\n\nHamiltonian (2) is integrated numerically using a finite differences scheme. The resulting electron and hole\nstates are plugged into Hamiltonian (1), together with\nthe Coulomb matrix elements, which we calculate using\nstatistical methods. The Hamiltonian is then solved using a configuration interaction routine.26 In this way, we\nobtain an accurate description of the ground and excited\nstates of the QDM system. To simulate their emission\nspectrum, we use the dipole approximation and Fermi's\ngolden rule.27 The recombination probability from an initial few-body state |ii to a final state |f i with one less\nelectron-hole pair, at an emission frequency \u03c9 is then\ngiven by:\n2\ni\nf\n\u03c4f\u22121\n\u2190i (\u03c9) \u221d |hf | P\u0302 |ii| \u0393(E \u2212 E \u2212 h\u0304\u03c9) pi (T ),\n\n(4)\n\nwhere P\u0302 is the polarization operator28 , E s is the energy\nof the state |si and \u0393(E) is a Lorentzian curve centered\nat energy E, which simulates the intrinsic bandwidth of\nthe transition. pi (T ) is the thermal population distribution function for the initial state at temperature T .\nWe shall consider two possible dynamics for the emission process: (i) emission takes place from all the excited\nstates, which are populated through non-resonant excitation, prior to their thermal relaxation. We simulate this\nadopting the same occupation probability for all the initial states, pi (T ) = 1; (ii) recombination once the thermal\nequilibrium is reached. In this case we assume a Boltz\u2206Ei\nmann distribution pi (T ) = Z gg0i e\u2212 kT . Here gi (g0 ) is\nthe degeneracy factor of the state |ii (ground state), \u2206Ei\nthe energy difference between |ii and the ground state,\nk the Boltzmann constant and Z the normalization constant.\nIn our calculations we consider laterally coupled\nInGaAs/GaAs QDs. We shall use parameters which,\nfor long interdot distances, fit the emission spectrum\nobserved in single QDs fabricated upon GaAs nanohole\ntemplates.10,16 Effective masses are m\u2217e = 0.0324 and\nm\u2217h = 0.435, as corresponding to In0.75 Ga0.25 As, and the\ndielectric constant \u01eb = 12.3.29 The electron confinement\nfrequencies are h\u0304\u03c9e,L = 35 meV and h\u0304\u03c9e,R = 34\nmeV, so that the right QD is slightly bigger than\nthe left QD. This is the situation found in some real\nsamples.15,16 Hole confinement frequencies are taken\nsuch that lhp= 0.59 le , where li is the characteristic\nlength, li = h\u0304/m\u2217i \u03c9i . This means that holes are more\nconfined than electrons, and their tunneling will be\nnegligible. Similar lh /le ratios have been estimated in\nrecent experiments with InGaAs QDs.30 The bandwidth\nof the Lorentzian function in our spectral simulations is\n0.05 meV. For the many-body calculation, we project\nHamiltonian (1) onto all the single-particle configurations which can be obtained by combining the 24\nlowest-energy electron and hole spin-orbitals. The origin\nof electron (hole) single-particle energies is taken at the\nedge of the conduction (valence) band, disregarding the\nz-confinement energy, which is constant for all the states.\n\nIII.\nA.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nExciton and negative trion\n\nFigure 2 shows the emission spectrum of the QDM as a\nfunction of the interdot distance d, from d = 40 nm (isolated QDs) to d = 20 nm (strongly coupled QDs). Solid\nred and dashed green lines are used for negative trions\n(X \u2212 ) and neutral excitons (X 0 ), respectively. Here we\nassume an out-of-equilibrium system. In this way, we\nsimulate optically active transitions from ground and excited states of both QDs, as normally observed in the\nphotoluminescence spectra of vertical4\u20136 and lateral15\u201317\n\n\f3\nQDMs. The most remarkable result of Fig. 2 is that the\nX \u2212 and X 0 resonances follow very different evolutions\nas the QDs are brought closer together. To understand\nthe different behavior, we need to analyze each excitonic\ncomplex in detail.\n1 2\n\na b\n\nd=30 nm\n\n3 6'\n2' 5\n\n1'\n\n0.035\n\nX0\n\n4\n5 6'\n\n0.03\n\nE\u2010Eg (eV)\n\nIntensity (arb. units)\n\nd=40 nm\n\nfrom previous calculations for asymmetric lateral QDMs,\nwhere the two lowest X 0 states were at some point\nblueshifted by Coulomb coupling.7 This is due to the different confining potentials in the models. In Ref. 7, the\ninterdot barrier was a step-like potential. Instead, we\nuse a parabolic potential such that, with decreasing d,\nnot only the QDs are closer but also the barrier is lower.\nFor this reason, tunnel coupling effects rapidly overcome\nCoulomb coupling in our system. Real QDMs are lensshaped QDs with some degree of lateral contact.10 As the\ndots are brought closer, the height in the contact region\nincreases. We then believe our model is more appropriate.\n\n0.025\nb\na\n\n0.02\n\nd=20 nm\n0.01\n\n0.015\n200\n0.014\n\n0.018\n\n0.022\n\n0.026\n\nE\u2010Eg (eV)\n\n240\n\n280\n\n320\n\n360\n\n400\n\nd (A)\n\nFIG. 2.

Grey lines are a guide to the eyes.\nSee text for the meaning of labels.\n\nFIG. 3. (Color online). Energy of the lowest exciton states\nas a function of the interdot distance. The insets show the\ncharge density of the electron (red line) and hole (green line)\nwithin the exciton complex for the optically active states, at\nd = 40 nm (right) and d = 20 nm (left).\n\nIn the limit of the uncoupled QDM, d = 40 nm, X 0\nshows two resonances of similar intensity split by \u223c 1\nmeV. As d is reduced, the two resonances are slowly redshifted, but the energy splitting remains approximately\nconstant. This behavior can be understood from the exciton states, plotted in Fig. 3. The emission resonances\ncorrespond to the two lowest X 0 states. At d = 40 nm,\nthese are the direct excitons, with the electron-hole pair\nin the big (low-energy resonance) and small (high-energy\nresonance) QD, see right-side insets in the figure. Indirect\nexcitons (electron and hole in opposite QDs) are much\nhigher in energy and optically dark because the electronhole overlap is negligible. As the interdot distance decreases, tunnel coupling allows electrons and holes to\nstart hybridizing and form incipient molecular orbitals,\neven if the QDs are not exactly resonant. The lowest\nX 0 state corresponds to bonding (nodeless) electron and\nhole orbitals, so it is redshifted. The first excited state\ncorresponds to bonding electron but antibonding hole orbital (note the presence of a node in the green line of the\nupper-left inset). Yet, this makes little difference because\nhole tunneling is negligible. As a result, the two states\nare redshifted by a similar amount.\nThe X 0 emission spectrum shown in Fig. 2 differs\n\nNext we investigate the X \u2212 spectrum. As can be seen\nin Fig. 2, at d = 40 nm there are four resonances associated with X \u2212 states. Two resonances \u2013(1) and (2)\u2013 are\na few meV below those of X 0 , while two are degenerate with the X 0 ones. As d is reduced, several features\nshow up which differ from the simple behavior of neutral\nexcitons: (i) the number of resonances increases (up to\n10); (ii) the two low-energy resonances invert their ordering; (iii) the degeneracy between the high-energy X \u2212\nand the X 0 resonances is lifted. Significantly, most of\nthis occurs even before the neutral exciton starts feeling\ntunnel coupling (see e.g. d = 34 nm).\nTo understand the X \u2212 emission spectrum, we study\nthe energy levels of the initial (X \u2212 ) and final (1e\u2212 )\nstates, which are plotted in Fig. 4. The electron,\nFig. 4(b), displays a simple dissociation spectrum typical of diatomic heteronuclear molecules. At d = 40 nm\nthe electron is in one of the two QDs (see right insets).\nWith decreasing d, it forms bonding and antibonding\n(noded) molecular orbitals (see left insets). As for the\ntrion, Fig. 4(a), the two lowest-energy states correspond\nto the so-called direct trion states. Their behavior is the\nsame as that of X 0 . Namely, at d = 40 nm all the carri-\n\n\f4\nS\n\nS\n\n200\n0.065\n\nT\n\n240\n\nd (A)\n\n280\n\nS,T\n320\n\n360\n\n400\n\na)\n\nE\u2010Eg (eV)\n\nS,T\nT\n\n0.06\n\n0.055\n\n0.05\n\nX-\n\n0.045\n6' 5' 6\n0.045\n\n5\n\n2' 1' 4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\nb)\n\n0.04\n\nE (eV)\n\ners are localized inside one of the QDs, and they are redshifted with decreasing d owing to electron hybridization\n(see insets). As indicated by the vertical arrows in Fig. 4,\nresonance 1 (2) in Fig. 2 originates in the transition from\nthe direct X \u2212 state in the right (left) QD to the electron state in the same QD. The energy splitting between\nthe two initial states is larger than that between the final states. As a result, transition (1) is lower in energy.\nHowever, as d decreases the situation reverses. Transition (1) involves bonding initial and final states, whose\nenergetic stabilizations due to tunnel-coupling compensate each other. As a result, the energy of the transition\nis little sensitive to the coupling (see Fig. 2). In contrast,\ntransition (2) involves a bonding initial state but an antibonding final state, so its energy rapidly decreases. This\nis also seen in Fig. 2 and leads to a reversal of resonances\n(1) and (2) at d \u223c 32 nm. What is more, because of\nthe QDM asymmetry, transitions between bonding and\nantibonding states are not symmetry-forbidden. Then,\nwhen electron hybridization takes place new transitions\nstart developing, (1') and (2').\nResonances (3),(4),(5) and (6) in the X \u2212 spectrum\noriginate in a set of excited trion states with energy\n\u223c 0.055 eV at d = 40 nm. These are the so-called indirect trions, where one electron sits in a QD and the\nremaining electron-hole pair sits in the opposite QD (see\ninsets in Fig. 4). When the electron-hole pair recombines,\nthe electron in the opposite QD remains. At d = 40 nm,\nthe Coulomb interaction between the two QDs is so weak\nthat the indirect trion resonances have the same energy\nas those of X 0 . With decreasing d, however, the behavior\nof indirect trions becomes noticeably different from that\nof neutral excitons. The indirect trion states split into\ntwo groups. One group is formed by states where the\ntwo electrons form a singlet spin configuration. These\nstates increase in energy and eventually anticross with\nhigher states. This destabilization is mainly caused by\nthe gradual enhancement of the antibonding character.\nIn contrast, the group of states with electrons forming a\ntriplet remains almost insensitive to tunnel-coupling due\nto the spin-blockade. This effect is analogous to that\nobserved in vertical QDMs under electric fields, where\nthe Pauli exclusion principle prevents triplet states from\ntunneling.4 The characteristic evolution of indirect trions vs. d is responsible for the lifting of the degeneracy\nwith X 0 resonances observed in Fig. 2. Last, as in the\ncase of direct trions, the QDM asymmetry enables transitions from indirect trions to either bonding or antibonding electron states, which gives rise to new resonances\nwhen electrons hybridize, (5') and (6').\nThe different evolution of X \u2212 and X 0 resonances in\nthe emission spectrum of QDMs can be used to elucidate\nthe presence of molecular coupling. The appearance of\nadditional trion resonances should be a clear signature,\nbut they may be too weak for typical interdot distances\n(d = 30 \u2212 40 nm in Ref. 10). A more evident signature\nshould be the splitting between X 0 and indirect X \u2212 resonances, which involves intense optical resonances and is\n\n0.035\n\n0.03\n\n1e0.025\n200\n\n240\n\n280\n\n320\n\n360\n\n400\n\nd (A)\n\nFIG. 4.

Vertical arrows indicate the transitions\nobserved in Fig. 2.\n\nvisible for long interdot distances (d \u223c 36 nm in Fig. 2).\nFinally, the reversal of resonances (1) and (2) may also\nbe noticed in experiments. For d < 34 nm, this implies that trion emission from the bigger QD occurs at\nhigher energy than that from the smaller QD, contrary\nto the ordering of X 0 resonances. As a matter of fact,\nthis anomalous spectral ordering has been recently found\nin photoluminescence measurements of lateral QDMs.16\nB.\n\nPositive trion\n\nWe next study the emission spectrum of the positive\ntrion (X + ). In this case, assuming equal population for\nall the initial states would lead to a complex spectrum\nwith many resonances involving highly-excited initial and\nfinal states. Since we are interested in the main transitions only, the emission spectrum plotted in Fig. 5 has\nbeen computed assuming thermal equilibrium at T = 80\nK. At this temperature, the X + states with significant\npopulation are essentially the same as previously studied\nfor X \u2212 . The only remaining signature of transitions between excited states is the low-energy resonance labeled\nwith an asterisk in Fig. 5, which will not be studied here.\nComparing Figs. 5 and 2 one can see that the X +\nemission pattern differs considerably from the X \u2212 one.\nTo analyze the emission spectrum, in Fig. 6 we represent\nthe initial (X + ) and final (1h+ ) states as a function of\nthe interdot distance.

Emission spectrum of positive trions for different\ninterdot distances. Dashed lines are a guide to the eyes.\n\n\u2212\n\nrespect to X can be seen in the final state, Fig. 6(b).\nUnlike for electrons, the two lowest hole states remain almost unaltered throughout the entire range of d, due to\nthe negligible tunneling. This means that the evolution\nof the X + emission spectrum can be entirely interpreted\nfrom the initial X + states. The second important difference is in the X + states, plotted in Fig. 6(a). There we\nfind two direct and two indirect states, as in the X \u2212 case,\nbut now their energy ordering is reversed. At d = 40\nnm, the two lowest states are indirect trions, with one\nhole in each QD and the electron in either the left or\nright QD (see insets). We note that indirect X + ground\nstates have also been obtained in 3D atomistic calculations23 , and are due the larger magnitude of the hole-hole\nCoulomb repulsion as compared to the electron-hole attraction, i.e. |Vhh | > |Veh |. The situation is the opposite\nto that of X \u2212 , where |Vee | < |Veh |, which favors direct\ntrion configurations.\nThe resonances labeled as (2) and (4) in Fig. 5 originate in the recombination of the direct trions. As the\ninterdot distance is reduced they redshift slowly. The\nevolution of the indirect trion resonances, (1) and (3),\nis however drastic. The two resonances become rapidly\nsplit with decreasing d, reflecting the strong splitting of\nindirect trions in Fig. 6(a). Such a large splitting follows\nfrom the strong tunneling of indirect X + . Unlike for X 0 ,\nthe electron in indirect X + can tunnel back and forth\nwithout losing the strong on-site Coulomb attraction Veh .\nThis clearly favors molecular coupling.31 Furthermore,\nthe electron delocalization over the entire QDM enables\neffective recombination with both holes, leading to the\n\n1h+\n\n0.008\n\nb)\n\n0.006\n200\n\n240\n\n280\n\n320\n\n360\n\n400\n\nd (A)\n\nFIG. 6.

Vertical arrows indicate the\ntransitions observed in 5.\n\nC.\n\nLow temperature spectra\n\nIn this section, we re-examine the emission spectra assuming thermal equilibrium at low temperature. This\ngreatly simplifies the spectrum, as only populated initial\nstates contribute to the spectrum. We consider T = 25\nK, which is enough for both QDs to have finite occupation. Fig. 7 shows the emission spectrum for X \u2212 (solid\nred lines), X 0 (dashed green lines) and X + (dotted blue\nlines). The evolution of X 0 and X \u2212 (X + ) resonances is\nessentially that of the direct (indirect) species discussed\nabove. Under these conditions, the only signatures of\ncoupling remaining are: (i) the appearance of weak X \u2212\nresonances, labeled in red as (1') and (2'), and (ii) the\npresence of strong low-energy X + resonances. These\ntransitions arise from the ground (indirect) X + state,\nwhich soon split into (1) and (1') and undergo a rapid\nredshift with decreasing d. Thus, at d = 40 nm we start\nwith a typical spectrum of isolated QDs, where X 0 and\nX + resonances are close in energy, while X \u2212 resonances\nare a few meV below.32,33 As d is reduced, the X + resonances redshift and approach those of X \u2212 .\n\n\f6\n\nIntensity (arb. units)\n\nd=40 nm\n\n1\n1'\n\n2\n\n2'\n1\n\n1'\n\n2 3'\n\n4\n\nd=30 nm\na\n\nb\n\nd=20 nm\n0.014\n\n0.016\n\n0.018\n\n0.02\n\nE\u2010Eg (eV)\n\n0.022\n\n0.024\n\nFIG. 7.

We have shown that tunneling of\ntrions is stronger than that of neutral excitons. This is\nbecause the net Coulomb interactions the electron has\nto overcome in order to tunnel are smaller. As a result,\nX \u00b1 display signatures of molecular coupling at longer\n\n\u2217\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\ninterdot distances than X 0 . The signatures include: (i)\nthe appearance of additional optical resonances; (ii) the\ninversion of the ordering of direct trion resonances corresponding to the big and small QDs; (iii) the lifting of\nthe degeneracy between indirect trion and neutral exciton resonances; (iv) a pronounced redshift of the indirect\nX + resonance, which approaches that of X \u2212 . We note\nthat signature (ii) has been actually observed in recent\nphotoluminescence experiments.16 We have also shown\nthat X \u2212 and X + develop different emission patterns.\nThese results are particularly valuable in the view of\nrecent experimental progress to control the charge of excitonic complexes in QDMs.15\u201317 It has been recently\nshown that trions are more sensitive than excitons to electric fields, owing to their net electric charge.23 This, together with our results, suggests that current attempts to\nutilize lateral QDMs should focus on trion species rather\nthan neutral excitons. In both positive and negative trions electron tunneling can be efficient. Yet, positive trions might be less suited because the spin of holes is very\nsensitive to the in-plane confinement anisotropy.34,35 In\na lateral QDM, the X + ground state contains one hole\nin each QD. The holes then feel the mutual Coulomb\nrepulsion as a source of anisotropic confinement, which\ntranslates into spin mixing. This could hamper the implementation of spin-based quantum information protocols.\n\njosep.planelles@uji.es; http://quimicaquantica.uji.es/\nG. Burkard, D. Loss and D. P. DiVincenzo, Phys. Rev.
