These results are an improvement over what could be obtained with N non-entangled\nphotons carrying an orbital angular momentum of l~ per photon.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nPrecision measurements are important not only for verifying a given physical theory but also for possible applications of the theory. For example, the fact that relative\ndisplacements can be measured with sub-wavelength sensitivity through optical phase measurements has led to\nmany useful applications in a wide variety of fields including cosmology, nanotechnology, metrology and medicine.\nIn generic classical schemes for optical phase measurements, the sensitivity is limited by what is \u221a\nknown as the\nstandard quantum limit, which scales as 1/ N , where N\nis either the average number of photons in the coherent\nstate input to the interferometer or the number of times\nthe experiment is repeated with one-photon fock-state input [1, 2]. More recent works have shown that the use of\nnon-classical states of light can lead to improved sensitivity in optical phase measurements [3\u20136]. In particular, it\nhas been shown that an N -photon entangled-state input\nto an interferometer gives rise to phase super-resolution\n[5, 7\u201310], that is, the narrowing of interference fringes by\nN times compared to the fringes obtained with classical\nschemes at the same wavelength. It has also been shown\nthat with N entangled photons the sensitivity of optical\u221aphase measurements scales as 1/N , in contrast to the\n1/ N scaling obtained using N non-entangled photons\n[11, 12]. The 1/N scaling is also known as the Heisenberg\nlimit.\nIn this paper, we consider an analogous type of measurement, namely, angular-displacement measurements.\nWe seek to determine how accurately the angular orientation of an optical component can be measured using\npurely optical methods. Specifically, we consider an optical component in the form of a Dove prism and seek to\nmeasure its angular orientation by determining the rotation angle induced in an optical beam in passing through\n\nthe prism. We assume that the prism is located in one\narm of an interferometer. We thus seek to answer the\nquestion as to how accurately the angular displacements\n(rotations) introduced in a beam of light inside an interferometer can be measured. Measurements of this\nsort are generic to a broad class of problems in quantum\nmetrology. We explicitly analyze measurement schemes\nfor two and four entangled photons and compare the angular resolution and sensitivity with those obtained using\nclassical measurement schemes. We find that the use of\nentangled photons with non-zero orbital angular momentum increases the resolution and sensitivity of angular\ndisplacement measurements. The angular resolution increases by a factor of N l while the angular sensitivity\nincreases as 1/2N l, where N is the number of entangled photons and l the magnitude of the orbital-angularmomentum mode index.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we obtain analytic expressions for the two- and four-photon\nfields produced by parametric down-conversion. In Sec.\nIII, we employ a 4 \u00d7 4 matrix formulation to study the\npropagation of entangled OAM modes through various\noptical elements and illustrate super-sensitive angulardisplacement measurements with two and four entangled\nphotons. Section IV presents our conclusions.\nII.\n\nENTANGLED PHOTONS PRODUCED BY\nPARAMETRIC DOWN-CONVERSION\n\nWe start with the following interaction Hamiltonian\n\u0124(t) for parametric down-conversion (PDC) [13]:\nZ\n(\u2212)\n(\u2212)\n\u01eb0\n(+)\n\u0124(t) =\nd3 r\u03c7(2) E0 (r, t)\u00cas (r, t)\u00cai (r, t)\n2 V\n+ H.c., (1)\nwhere V is the volume of the interacting part of the nonlinear crystal and \u03c7(2) is the second-order nonlinear sus(+)\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: akjha9@gmail.com\n\u2020 Electronic address: girish.agarwal@okstate.edu\n\u2021 Electronic address: boydrw@mac.com\n\n(\u2212)\n\nceptibility. \u00caj (r, t) and \u00caj (r, t) are the positiveand negative-frequency parts of the electric field, where\nj = s and i stand for the signal and idler, respectively.\n\n\f2\nThe pump field E0 is assumed to be strong and will therefore be treated classically. We decompose the three electric fields in terms of field-modes ulp (r) carrying orbital\nangular momentum (OAM). These modes are characterized by two indices, l and p, and carry an OAM of l~\nper photon owing to their azimuthal phase dependence\nof eil\u03c6 [14]. The index l is referred to as the OAM mode\nindex. The modes ulp (r) are assumed to have the following general form\neil\u03c6\nulp (r) = Rp (\u03c1, z) \u221a ,\n2\u03c0\n\n(2)\n\nwith Rp (\u03c1, z) being aPcomplete set of orthonormal, ra\u2217\n\u2032\n\u2032\ndial modes, that is,\np \u03c1Rp (\u03c1, z) Rp (\u03c1 , z) = \u03b4(\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1 )\nR\n\u2217\nand \u03c1d\u03c1Rp (\u03c1, z) Rp\u2032 (\u03c1, z) = \u03b4pp\u2032 . One possible choice\nfor ulp (r) are the Laguerre-Gaussian modes, but the\nbest choice is usually the Schimdt modes of the downconverted field, which, in general, are not the LaguerreGaussian modes [15]. The three electric fields can now\nbe written as\n(+)\n\nE0 (r, t) = A(\u03c90 )ulp00 (r)e\u2212i\u03c90 t ,\nX \u2020\n(\u2212)\n\u00cas (r, t) =\n\u00e2ls ,ps (\u03c9s )uplss\u2217 (r)ei\u03c9s t ,\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nls ,ps\n\n\u00cai\n\n(\u2212)\n\n(r, t) =\n\nX\n\n\u00e2\u2020li ,pi (\u03c9i )ulpii\u2217 (r)ei\u03c9i t .\n\nWorking in the cylindrical coordinate\nR 2\u03c0 system and using the orthogonality relation 0 d\u03c6ei(l0 \u2212ls \u2212li )\u03c6 =\n2\u03c0\u03b4l0 ,ls +li , we arrive at the following expression for the\ntwo-photon state:\nX\n(8)\n\u03c7l,ps ,pi |l, ps is | \u2212 l, pi ii ,\n|\u03c82 i =\nl,ps ,pi\n\nwhere\n\u03c7l,ps ,pi =\n\n\u01eb0 \u03c7(2) A(\u03c90 )\nZ Z2i~\n\u00d7\n\n\u03c1d\u03c1dzRps (\u03c1, z)Rpi (\u03c1, z)Rp0 (\u03c1, z) (9)\n\nis the probability amplitude that the signal and idler photons are in the modes characterized by indices (l, ps ) and\n(\u2212l, pi ), respectively. Next, we consider a detection system that is insensitive to the radial indices and is sensitive only to the OAM mode index. With respect to such\ndetection systems the above state can be written as\nXp\n|\u03c82 i =\nPl |lis | \u2212 lii ,\n(10)\nl\n\nwhere\n(5)\n\nPl =\n\nli ,pi\n\nX\n\nps ,pi\n\nHere we have assumed that the signal, idler and pump\nfields are monochromatic with frequencies \u03c9s , \u03c9i and\n\u03c90 , respectively. The three fields interact for some time\nwithin the nonlinear crystal and the state |\u03c8i of the\ndown-converted\nafter theiointeraction is given\nn photons\nh\nR\nby |\u03c8i = T exp 1/(i~) dt\u0124(t) |\u03c80 i, where |\u03c80 i =\n|vacis |vacii is the initial vacuum state before the interaction, with no photons in either the signal or the idler\nmode. We assume perfect frequency phase-matching\nsuch that \u03c90 = \u03c9s + \u03c9i ; the symbol T represents operator time-ordering. Taking the parametric interaction\nto be very weak, we then write the state |\u03c8i in terms of\na perturbative expansion [13]:\n\nl,l\u2032\n\nwhere\nPl,l\u2032 =\n\nX X\n\nh \u01eb \u03c7(2) A(\u03c9 ) X X\n0\n0\n\u00e2\u2020ls ,ps \u00e2\u2020li ,pi\n2i~\nls ,ps li ,pi\nZ\ni\nd3 rulpss\u2217 (r)ulpii\u2217 (r)ulp00 (r) + H.c. |vacis |vacii .

(6) and obtain\n|\u03c82 i =\n\n(11)\n\nis the probability that the orbital angular momenta of\nthe signal and idler photons are l~ and \u2212l~, respectively.\nThe next term in the expansion of Eq.

From this section onwards, we use the\nmode label to also represent the annihilation operator\ncorresponding to that mode. For example, \u015d and \u00ee represent the annihilation operators corresponding to the\nsignal(s) and idler(i) modes, respectively. Further, a\ngiven mode is separated into two different modes, one\ncorresponding to the positive value of the orbital angular momentum and the other corresponding to the negative value. Thus \u015d\u2212l represents the annihilation operator corresponding to the signal mode having an OAM\nof \u2212l~, etc. In accordance with the above notation, we\nalso change the notation for representing the state of the\nphotons. For example, |2is+l represents two photons in s\nmode with orbital angular momentum +l~ per photon.\n\nThe two non-zero off-diagonal matrix elements show that,\nupon passage through a Dove prism, an OAM mode picks\nup an additional phase of \u03c0 \u2212 2l\u03b8 [16], where l is the orbital angular momentum mode index and \u03b8 is the angle\nof rotation of the Dove prism. The first two diagonal elements are zero due to the fact that upon passage through\na Dove prism a modes changes the sign of its OAM mode\nindex. We note that both Mmir and Mbs are unitary\nmatrices.\nWe are now ready to analyze the situations shown in\nFigs. 2 and 3. In these schemes, the entangled photons\nproduced by PDC in modes s and i are mixed at a beam\nsplitter (BS1). A \u03b8 rotation of the Dove prism (DP)\nthen rotates the photon-field in mode g with respect to\nthe field in mode h. The photons are then mixed at the\nsecond beam splitter (BS2) and detected subsequently in\nmodes a and b. Our aim is to determine the resolution\nand sensitivity with which the rotation angle \u03b8 can be\nmeasured. Using the transformation properties of OAM\nmodes as given by Eqs. (14), (15) and (16), we express\nthe output mode annihilation operators in terms of the\ninput mode annihilation operators as\n\nNext, we summarize the transformation properties of\nOAM modes when they pass through either a beam splitter(BS), a pair of mirrors or a Dove prism. We note that\nupon reflection an OAM mode changes the sign of its\nmode index and also picks up an additional phase. This\nadditional phase is equal to \u03c0/2 when the mode reflects\nfrom a symmetric beam splitter and is equal to \u03c0 when\nit reflects from a mirror [16]. The beam splitter transformation matrix is calculated in the following way. As\nshown in Fig. 1(i), let us suppose that a and b are the\ninput modes to a beam splitter and c and d are the output modes. The annihilation operators corresponding to\nmode a are \u00e2+l and \u00e2\u2212l , etc. Using the standard beamsplitter operator algebra [17], we obtain the relationship\nbetween the input and output mode annihilation opera-\n\nO = Mbs Mdp (\u03b8)Mmir Mbs Mmir I = M I,\nwhere\n\uf8f6\n\u00e2+l\n\uf8ec \u00e2\u2212l \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\nO=\uf8ec\n\uf8ed b\u0302+l \uf8f8\nb\u0302\u2212l\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\u015d+l\n\uf8ec \u015d\u2212l \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\nand I = \uf8ec\n\uf8ed \u00ee+l \uf8f8 .\n\u00ee\u2212l\n\n(17)\n\n\f4\n\nDP(\u03b8)\ng\n\ns\nBS1\n\na\n\nDa\n|l\u3009\n\nBS2\nb\n\nh\n\nPDC i\n\n|-l\u3009\nDb\n\nFIG. 2: Scheme for supersensitive measurement of angular\ndisplacement using two entangled photons. \u03b8 is the angle of\nrotation of the Dove prism in mode g. Da and Db are detectors set to detect one photon each in the mode characterized\nby index l and \u2212l, respectively\n.\n\nIn order to calculate the state in the output modes a and\nb, we need to obtain the inverse relationship, that is, we\nneed to express the input mode annihilation operators in\nterms of the output mode annihilation operators. Therefore, we invert the above matrix equation and write it\nas\nI=M\n\n\u22121\n\n\u2020\n\nO = M O,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere the last equality results from the fact that M is\na unitary matrix (M \u22121 = M \u2020 ), with |detM | = 1, where\ndet denotes the determinant. Now taking the transpose\nof the above equation we obtain:\nI \u2020 = O\u2020 M.\n\n(19)\n\nWe note that I \u2020 and O\u2020 are four-element row vectors:\nI \u2020 = (\u015d\u2020+l , \u015d\u2020\u2212l , \u00ee\u2020+l , \u00ee\u2020\u2212l ) and O\u2020 = (\u00e2\u2020+l , \u00e2\u2020\u2212l , b\u0302\u2020+l , b\u0302\u2020\u2212l ). Using Eqs. (14) through (17), we solve Eq. (19) to obtain\nthe following operator relations:\n\u015d\u2020+ = k1 \u00e2\u2020+ + ik2 b\u2020\u2212 ,\n\n\u015d\u2020\u2212 = k1 \u00e2\u2020\u2212 + ik2 b\u2020+ ;\n\n(20a)\n\n\u00ee\u2020+ = ik4 \u00e2\u2020\u2212 + k3 b\u2020+ ,\n\n\u00ee\u2020\u2212 = ik4 \u00e2\u2020+ + k3 b\u2020\u2212 ;\n\n(20b)\n\nwhere k1 = k3\u2217 = 21 (\u22121 \u2212 e2il\u03b8 ), k2 = k4\u2217 = 12 (\u22121 + e2il\u03b8 ).\nWith the above operator relations, we next calculate the\nangular resolution and sensitivity that can be obtained\nwith two and four entangled photons.\nA.\n\nSupersensitive measurement with two entangled\nphotons\n\nIn this subsection, we illustrate supersensitive angulardisplacement measurements with two entangled photons\nusing the detection scheme depicted in Fig. 2. We consider a class of states |\u03c82l i that are obtained from Eq. (10)\nby keeping only terms with the OAM mode indices \u00b1l for\na given value of l:\nr\n\u0003\n1\u0002\nl\n(21)\n|1is+l |1ii\u2212l + |1is\u2212l |1ii+l .\n|\u03c82 i =\n2\n\nIn practice, such states can be obtained from the state\nproduced by PDC by placing appropriate phase apertures\nin the paths of the signal and idler photons [18]. We note\nthat we have used the alternative notation in writing the\nstate |\u03c82l i, which can be written in terms of the input\nmode creation operators as\nr h\ni\n1 \u2020 \u2020\nl\n\u015d+l \u00ee\u2212l + \u015d\u2020\u2212l \u00ee\u2020+l |vaci.\n(22)\n|\u03c82 i =\n2\nUsing the operator relations of Eq. (20), we express the\nabove state in terms of the output mode creation operators to obtain\nr\n1\n|\u03c82l i =\n[(k1 \u00e2\u2020+l + ik2 b\u2020\u2212l )(ik4 \u00e2\u2020+l + k3 b\u2020\u2212l )\n2\n+ (k1 \u00e2\u2020\u2212l + ik2 b\u2020+l )(ik4 \u00e2\u2020\u2212l + k3 b\u2020+l )]|vaci. (23)\nWe now estimate the angular resolution and sensitivity\nthrough use of the following measurement operator [9]:\n\u00c22 = |1ia+l |1ib\u2212l a+l h1|b\u2212l h\u22121|,\n\n(24)\n\nwhich measures the probability of detecting a photon in\nmode a with the OAM mode index l and another photon\nin mode b with the OAM mode index \u2212l. The measurement operator A2 does not see the complete state |\u03c82l i;\nthe effective post-selected state |\u03c82l ipost that \u00c22 sees is\nobtained from |\u03c82l i by keeping only the terms containing\n\u00e2\u2020+l b\u0302\u2020\u2212l . |\u03c82l ipost is given by:\n1\n|\u03c82l ipost = \u221a (k12 \u2212 k22 )\u00e2+l b\u0302\u2212l |vaci\n2\n\u0003\n1 \u0002\n= \u2212 \u221a 1 + e4il\u03b8 |1ia+l |1ib\u2212l .\n2 2\n\n(25)\n\nTaking the inner product of the above state with itself, we\nobtain post h\u03c82l |\u03c82l ipost = 21 cos2 2l\u03b8. We note that even in\nthe best case in which \u03b8 = 0, only half of the input state\nis detected in modes a+l and b\u2212l , since the other half\nof the state ends up in modes a\u2212l and b+l . The expectation value of the measurement operator \u00c22 is h\u00c22 i =\nTr[\u00c22 |\u03c82l ih\u03c82l |] = Tr[\u00c22 |\u03c82l ipostpost h\u03c82l |] = cos2 (2l\u03b8). We\nthus see that there is a two-fold enhancement in the resolution of angular displacement measurements. Next, noting that h\u00c222 i = h\u00c22 i = cos2 (2l\u03b8), we obtain\nq\nsin(4l\u03b8)\nh\u2206\u00c22 i = h\u00c222 i \u2212 h\u00c22 i2 =\n.\n(26)\n2\nTherefore, the uncertainty \u2206\u03b8 in the estimation of the\nangular displacement is\n\u2206\u03b8 =\n\n1\nh\u2206\u00c22 i\n= .\n\u000e\n4l\n|\u2202h\u00c22 i \u2202\u03b8|\n\n(27)\n\nIn the next subsection we calculate the angular resolution and sensitivity using four entangled photons and also\nwith N entangled photons. We then compare these results with the angular resolution and sensitivity obtained\nwith N one-photon Fock state input.\n\n\f5\n\n|l\u3009\n|l\u3009\nDP(\u03b8)\ng\n\ns\nBS1\n\nDa3\n\na\nBS2\n\nh\n\nPDC i\n\n|l\u3009\n\nDa1\nDa2\n\nb\n|-l\u3009 D\nb1\n\nFIG. 3: A scheme for supersensitive measurement of angular\ndisplacement using four entangled photons. \u03b8 is the angle of\nrotation of the Dove prism in mode g.

(28)\nThe state |\u03c84l i can be written in terms of the input mode\ncreation operators as\n|\u03c84l i =\n\n1 \u2020 \u2020 \u2020 \u2020\n[\u015d \u015d \u00ee \u00ee + \u015d\u2020\u2212l \u015d\u2020\u2212l \u00ee\u2020+l \u00ee\u2020+l\n2 +l +l \u2212l \u2212l\n+ 2\u015d\u2020+l \u015d\u2020\u2212l \u00ee\u2020\u2212l \u00ee\u2020+l ]|vaci.\n\n(29)\n\nOur four-photon measurement operator \u00c24 is\n\u00c24 = |3ia+l |1ib\u2212l a+l h3|b\u2212l h1|,\n\n(30)\n\nwhich measures the probability of detecting three photons in mode a+l and one photon in mode b\u2212l . In Fig. 3,\nwe have depicted one possible way of carrying out such a\nmeasurement [9]. The particular choice of the measurement operator is motivated by the fact that in order to\nachieve super-sensitivity, the four-photon measurement\nneeds to post-select the ensemble that consists only of\nthe maximally entangled four-photon states. The effective post-selected state |\u03c84l ipost that the measurement\noperator \u00c24 sees is obtained by first expressing the state\n|\u03c84l i in terms of the output state creation operators using\nthe operator relations given in Eq. (20) and then keeping\nonly the terms containing \u00e2\u2020+l \u00e2\u2020+l \u00e2\u2020+l b\u0302\u2020\u2212l in the expansion.\nAfter a straightforward calculation we obtain:\n1\n(\u22122ik 3 k2 \u2212 2ik1 k23 )\u00e2\u2020+l \u00e2\u2020+l \u00e2\u2020+l b\u0302\u2020\u2212l |vaci\n4 \u221a 1\n\u0001\n\u2212i 6\n=\n(31)\n1 \u2212 e8il\u03b8 |3ia+l |1ib\u2212l .\n16\n\n|\u03c84l ipost =\n\nNow taking the inner product of the state with it3\nsin2 4l\u03b8. We note\nself, we find post h\u03c84l |\u03c84l ipost = 32\nthat even in the best case, when 4l\u03b8 = \u03c0/2, only\n3/32nd of the input intensity is detected by the measurement operator. The expectation value of the measurement operator is h\u00c24 i = h\u00c224 i = Tr[\u00c24 |\u03c84l ih\u03c84l |] =\nTr[\u00c24 |\u03c84l ipostpost h\u03c84l |] = sin2 (4l\u03b8), thus showing a fourfold enhancement in angularqresolution. The uncertainty\n\nh\u2206\u00c24 i is given by h\u2206\u00c24 i = h\u00c24 i \u2212 h\u00c24 i2 = sin(8l\u03b8)/2.\nTherefore, for the uncertainty \u2206\u03b8 in the estimation of angular displacement, we obtain\n\u2206\u03b8 =\n\nC.\n\nh\u2206\u00c24 i\n1\n= .\n\u000e\n8l\n|\u2202h\u00c24 i \u2202\u03b8|\n\n(32)\n\nAngular super-sensitivity with N entangled\nphotons\n\nProceeding in the same manner, one can show that,\nwith N entangled photons and a suitable detection\nscheme, the angular resolution gets enhanced by a factor\nof N and the angular sensitivity improves as\n\u2206\u03b8 =\n\n1\n.\n2N l\n\n(33)\n\nWe note that the angular sensitivity obtained with N\nentangled photons is greater than the angular sensitivity\n\u2206\u03b8Fock obtained with a stream of N one-photon Fock\nstate input to an interferometer,\nwhich can be shown\n\u221a\nto be \u2206\u03b8Fock = 1/(2 N l) [19]. We further note that\nEq. (33) is the maximum angular sensitivity that can be\nobtained with N entangled photons. In deriving Eq. (33),\nwe have not included other factors, such as the effects\ndue to post-selection, that also affect the sensitivity in\na laboratory situation. Some of these factors have been\ndiscussed by Okamoto et al. [20] in their work on phase\nsuper-sensitivity.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that the use of entangled photons having non-zero orbital angular momentum increases the resolution and sensitivity of angulardisplacement measurements performed using an interferometer. Using a 4 \u00d7 4 matrix formulation to study the\npropagation of entangled OAM modes, we have explicitly analyzed measurement schemes for two and four entangled photons. We have found that the resolution of\nangular-displacement measurements scales as N l while\nthe angular sensitivity increases as 1/(2N l), where N is\nthe number of entangled photons and l the magnitude of\nthe orbital-angular-momentum mode index. It has previously been established [21, 22] that the orbital angular\nmomentum of light constitutes a useful degree of freedom\n\n\f6\nfor applications in quantum optics and quantum information science. The work presented here provides another\nsuch example. The ability to detect small rotations of\noptical components or of light beams themselves holds\npromise for many applications both in remote sensing\nand for performing fundamental studies of the propagation of light through optical materials.\n\n[1] M.
