Since these TLSs can possess remarkably\nlong decoherence times, we show that such TLSs can themselves be used as qubits, allowing for a\nwell controlled initialization, universal sets of quantum gates, and readout. Thus, a single currentbiased Josephson junction (CBJJ) can be considered as a multiqubit register. It can be coupled to\nother CBJJs to allow the application of quantum gates to an arbitrary pair of qubits in the system.\nOur results indicate an alternative way to realize superconducting quantum information processing.\n\nSeveral advances in the field of quantum information processing using superconducting circuits have been\nmade in recent years [1]. A major obstacle to further advances, however, is the problem of decoherence. In particular, recent experiments on current-biased Josephson\njunctions (CBJJs) revealed resonances that suggest the\npresence of quantum two-level systems (TLSs) that are\nstrongly coupled to the CBJJ when it is biased near one of\nthose resonances [2, 3]. So far the TLSs have been treated\nas a nuisance that prevent the operation of the CBJJ as a\nqubit near any resonance. In this paper we show that the\nTLSs themselves can be used as qubits. The CBJJ then\nacts as a bus, enabling state initialization, one- and twoqubit operations, and readout. Moreover, the results of\nRefs. [2, 3] show that the decoherence times of the TLSs\nare longer than those of the CBJJ. That property can\nbe used in a scalable design such that the decoherence\ntime of the entire system scales as the CBJJ decoherence\ntime TdCBJJ , as opposed to the usual TdCBJJ /N , where N\nis the number of CBJJs in the circuit. Our results therefore demonstrate an alternative way to achieve a scalable\nqubit network in a superconducting system, in addition\nto illustrating a method to perform multi-qubit experiments with available experimental capabilities.\nModel.-The phase qubit, which is comprised of a single CBJJ, is one of the simplest experimental implementations of a qubit in superconducting systems [1, 4]. The\nworking states, |0i and |1i, are the (metastable) ground\nand first excited states in a local minimum of the washboard potential produced by the CBJJ. The (undriven)\nsystem is described by the Hamiltonian\nH=\n\nQ\u03022\nIc \u03a60\nIb \u03a60\nh\u0304\u03c910\n\u2212\ncos \u03c6\u0302 \u2212\n\u03c6\u0302 \u2248\n\u03c3z .\n2C\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n2\n\n(1)\n\nHere Q\u0302 is the operator of the charge on the junction,\nC is the junction's capacitance, \u03c6\u0302 is the operator of\nthe Josephson phase difference, and Ic , Ib (\u2264 Ic ) are\nthe critical and bias current, respectively. The nonlinearity of the potential allows to consider only the\ntwo lowest energy states. The Pauli matrix \u03c3z operates in the subspace {|0i, |1i}. The transition frequency\n\n\u03c910 \u2248 \u03c9p = (2\u03c0Ic /\u03a60 C)1/2 (1 \u2212 j 2 )1/4 , the plasma frequency in the biased junction (the corrections due to\nnonlinearity are \u223c 10% [5]), and j = Ib /Ic (see e.g. [4]).\nThe terms in the Hamiltonian proportional to \u03c3x and\n\u03c3y , which enable a complete set of one-qubit gates, appear in the rotated frame of reference when applying microwave pulses of bias current at the resonance frequency,\nIb \u2192 IDC + I\u03bcwc (t) cos(\u03c910 t) + I\u03bcws (t) sin(\u03c910 t), as explained in Ref. [5].\nThe simplicity of the qubit design and manipulation contributed to its successful experimental realization [1, 2, 5] and a spectroscopic demonstration of the\nformation of entangled two-qubit states [6]. Nevertheless\nthe experiment in Ref. [2] also demonstrated that TLSs\npresent in the tunneling barrier tend to destroy the coherent operation of the qubit (such as Rabi oscillations).\nSuch TLSs are ubiquitous in solid state systems wherever disorder is present and can be thought of as groups\nof atoms capable of tunneling through a potential barrier between two degenerate configurations. They are\ncurrently believed to be the main source of 1/f -noise in\nsolids.\nThe observed coherent oscillations between a TLS and\na phase qubit [7] proved that a TLS can be considered as\na coherent quantum object described by the pseudospin\nHamiltonian\nHTLS = \u2212\n\n\u2206\n\u01eb\n\u03c3\u0303x \u2212 \u03c3\u0303z ,\n2\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwith a decoherence time longer than that of the qubit.\nThe Pauli matrices \u03c3\u0303x and \u03c3\u0303z operate on the TLS states.\nNote that, since the nature of the TLSs is currently unknown, one cannot derive the values of the TLS parameters from first principles. As will become clear below,\nhowever, neither a derivation of those parameters nor an\nunderstanding of their physical origin is necessary in order to make use of the TLSs.\nAlthough the available experimental data gives rather\nlimited information about the TLS-TLS interaction, it is\nhighly unlikely that the TLSs interact directly with each\nother or with the external fields, because of their supposedly microscopic dipole moments and relatively large\n\n\f2\nspatial separation.\nThe TLS-CBJJ coupling is believed to be due to one\nof the following mechanisms: (A) through the critical\ncurrent dependence on the TLS position [2] or (B) the\ndirect dipole coupling to the junction charge Q\u0302 (which is\ncurrently considered more likely) [3, 8]:\n(A)\n\n\u0124int = \u2212\n(B)\n\n\u0124int\n\nIc \u03a60 \u03b4Ic\ncos \u03c6 \u03c3\u0303z ;\n2\u03c0 2Ic\n\n(3)\n\n= \u03b1 Q\u0302 \u03c3\u0303z .\n\nBoth produce the coupling term hx \u03c3x \u03c3\u0303z . In addition,\nin the former case there appears an hz \u03c3z \u03c3\u0303z -term, which\nreflects the change in the inter-level spacing \u03c910 due\nto the plasma frequency dependence on the bias. The\nratio \u03b3 \u2261 hz /hx = (EC /2EJ )1/4 (1 \u2212 j 2 )\u22125/8 , where\nEC = 2e2 /C and EJ = Ic \u03a60 /2\u03c0. If (EC /2EJ ) = 10\u22127\n(achievable using the external capacitor technique [3])\nand j = 0.90, then \u03b3 = 0.05 [9].\nHereafter, we consider the case where \u03b3 \u226a 1. Otherwise, the effective TLS-CBJJ decoupling is impossible\neven when out of resonance (on the positive side, this\neffect would provide the means to definitively establish\nthe mechanism of TLS-CBJJ coupling). Then, performing a basis transformation on the TLS states, relabeling\n[\u22062 + \u01eb2 ]1/2 \u2192 \u2206, and using the rotating-wave approximation, we finally obtain the effective Hamiltonian for\nthe TLS-CBJJ system:\n\u0013\nX \u0012 \u2206j\nh\u0304\u03c910\nj\nj\n(4)\n\u03c3z \u2212\n\u03c3\u0303 + \u03bbj \u03c3x \u03c3\u0303x ,\n\u0124 = \u2212\n2\n2 z\nj\nwith the effective coupling coefficients \u03bbj . The coupling\nterm acts only in resonance, when |h\u0304\u03c910 \u2212 \u2206j | < \u03bbj .\nThe Hamiltonian (4) was derived under the experimentally relevant assumption that the coupling \u03bb \u226a h\u0304\u03c910 \u223c\n\u2206. We neglected a term of the form \u03bc\u03c3x \u03c3\u0303zj in Eq. (4), because its influence on the system's dynamics is negligible\nwhen \u03bc \u226a h\u0304\u03c910 and \u03bc2 /h\u0304\u03c910 \u226a \u03bb.\nQubit operations.- The inter-level spacing h\u0304\u03c910 is\ntuned by the bias current, which together with the resonant behaviour of the TLS-CBJJ coupling allows the\nindependent manipulation of each TLS (due to the natural dispersion of their characteristic energies, \u2206j ). The\ncondition \u03bb \u226a \u2206, h\u0304\u03c910 allows us to consider changes in\nthe bias current as adiabatic from the point of view of internal CBJJ and TLS evolution, but instantaneous with\nrespect to the CBJJ-TLS dynamics.\nFirst, consider the single-qubit operations, assuming\nfor the time being that the decoherence times of the\n(j)\nTLSs, Td , exceed the decoherence time of the CBJJ,\nCBJJ\nTd\n, which in turn is much larger than the characteristic interaction time h\u0304/\u03bb. On resonance with the jth TLS,\nthe Hamiltonian (4) contains a block that acts as \u2212\u03bbj \u03c3x\nin the subspace of degenerate states {|1i \u2297 |gi, |0i \u2297 |ei}.\nIts operation leads to quantum beats between the states\n\nof the TLS and the CBJJ (see Fig. 1 (inset)), with the period \u03c4j \u2261 h\u0304/\u03bbj , as was observed in [2]. Therefore singlequbit operations on a TLS and its initialization to an\narbitrary state can be achieved as follows: After initializing the CBJJ in the state |0i we bring it in resonance\nwith the TLS for the duration \u03c4j /2; as a result the states\nof TLS and qubit are swapped,\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n|0i \u2297 (\u03b1|gi + \u03b2|ei) \u2192 ei 2 \u03b1ei 2 (1+\u2206/\u03bb) |0i + \u03b2|1i \u2297 |gi.\n(5)\nThen the CBJJ is taken out of resonance with the TLS, a\nrotation of its state is performed, and the resulting state\nis again transferred to the TLS (always compensating for\nthe parasite phase shifts \u03c02 (1+\u2206/\u03bb)). The readout of the\nqubit state can be performed after the swap (5), e.g. by\nusing the technique of [7], where the transition to the\nresistive state, with its potentially-problematic coupling\n(j)\nto the TLSs, is avoided. The decoherence time Td can\nbe determined using a similar sequence of operations, by\ninitializing the TLS in a superposition state, decoupling\nit from the CBJJ, and measuring the probability to find\nthe TLS in a given state after a given time. Note also\nthat if the Rabi frequency of CBJJ greatly exceeds the\nTLS-CBJJ coupling, the manipulations with the state of\nthe CBJJ can be performed while in resonance with a\nTLS, reducing the overall operation time [10].\nNote that as soon as the CBJJ is biased away from\nthe resonance with the TLS, they effectively decouple,\nand any perturbation of the quantum state of the CBJJ\ndoes not affect the survival of quantum coherence in the\nTLS. Therefore the quality factor (the number of gates,\nof average duration \u03c4gate , that can be performed in the\nsystem before it loses quantum coherence) is no less than\nTdCBJJ /\u03c4gate , and can exceed this value depending on the\nspecific decoherence decay law.\nThe application of two-qubit gates between two TLSs\ninside the same CBJJ can be achieved similarly. For\nexample, the universal ISWAP gate can be performed\nby the following sequence of operations: tune the CBJJ\nin resonance with TLS1 for \u03c41 /2, then tune it in resonance with TLS2 for \u03c42 /2, and finally again in resonance\nwith TLS1 for \u03c41 /2. (In the process each TLS qubit was\nalso rotated by \u03c0/2 around z-axis, which can be trivially\nrepaired by performing the single-qubit rotation as described in the previous paragraph.) At the end of the\nabove sequence, the CBJJ is decoupled and disentangled\nfrom both TLSs.\nNumerical estimates.- The idealized picture of twoqubit operations neglected (1) the finite detuning between TLS qubits, (2) the influence of other TLSs present\nin the CBJJ, (3) decoherence and (4) the finite time of\nthe CBJJ bias current adjustment. We numerically investigated the impact of these effects on the fidelity F\ndefined as the minimum\n\u2020\nF = min(h\u03a8i | Uideal\n\u03c1f Uideal |\u03a8i i)\n|\u03a8i i\n\n(6)\n\n\f3\nwhere |\u03a8i i is an initial state, Uideal is the (ideal) desired\noperation, and \u03c1f is the numerically obtained final density matrix. (note that the quantity inside the parenthese\nin Eq. (6) depends on the initial state).\n\nthe TLSs. Taking a simple linear ramp with t = 2 ns\nand no pulse optimization, and neglecting decoherence,\nwe find that the fidelity drops to 80%. Finite decoherence \u03931 = (1/2)\u03932 = \u03bb/20\u03c0 further suppresses it to 63%.\nThe above estimates show that the operation of the proposed two-qubit gate can be realized with the current\nexperimental techniques used, e.g., in Ref. [3].\nScalability.- To ensure the scalability of the system,\nwe must be able to perform two-qubit gates on TLSs located in different CBJJs. It can be done by swapping the\nstates of the capacitively coupled adjacent CBJJs like in\n[11], but a better solution is based on the method suggested in [12]. Here the qubit-carrying CBJJs are coupled\ncapacitively to a common linear LC circuit with resonance frequency \u03c90 much higher than the characteristic\nfrequencies of separate CBJJs (Fig. 2).\nUsing the standard formalism, we can write the Lagrangian of the system,\n\nL=\nFIG. 1: Fidelity of the ISWAP gate on two TLS qubits in\na CBJJ as a function of the relative difference between the\nTLS energy splittings (\u22061 and \u22062 , respectively). The solid\nline corresponds to no decoherence, the dashed and dotted\nlines correspond to CBJJ decoherence rates \u03931 = \u03bb/20\u03c0 and\n\u03931 = \u03bb/2\u03c0, respectively, where in both cases \u03932 = 2\u03931 . The\nmuch slower decoherence of the TLSs have been neglected.\n\u03bb = 0.005\u22061 .

The results are as follows (see\nFig. 1). For two TLS qubits, with \u03bb1 = \u03bb2 = 0.005\u22061\n(values close to the experimental data [2, 7]), the fidelity\nfirst reaches 90% when \u03b4 \u2261 |\u22061 \u2212 \u22062 | = 3.5\u03bb, and 99%\nwhen \u03b4 \u2248 10\u03bb. When \u03b4 = 8\u03bb, the fidelity is 98.8%.\nAdding an idle TLS with \u03bb = 0.002\u22061 in resonance with\none of the qubit TLSs reduces the fidelity to 80% (94%\nfor \u03bb = 0.001\u22061 ). Finally, with two qubit TLSs with\nreduced energies 1 and 1.04, four idle TLSs with reduced\nenergies 0.99, 1.01, 1.03 and 1.05, and the reduced coupling strengths \u03bbqubit = 0.005 and \u03bbidle = 0.002, respectively, we find that the fidelity of the ISWAP gate \u2248 95%.\nTherefore, we conclude that the finite detuning and presence of idle TLSs per se is not dangerous.\nWe now take into account the decoherence in the\nCBJJ, neglecting the much weaker one in the TLSs. The\nISWAP fidelity with \u03b4 = 8\u03bbj and without idle TLSs is\n81% when \u03931 = (1/2)\u03932 = \u03bb/20\u03c0, but it drops to 13%\nwhen \u03931 = (1/2)\u03932 = \u03bb/2\u03c0.\nFinally, we now consider the effects of a finite CBJJ\nbias switching time between the resonant frequencies of\n\nwhere \u03c6\u0302 = (h\u0304/2e)\u03c6\u0302 (see Eq. (1)), [\u03c6\u0302j , p\u0302j ] = ih\u0304, C \u22121 is the\ninverse capacitance matrix, \u03c90 is the frequency of the LC\nbus, \u03c9j is the frequency of the jth CBJJ in the harmonic\napproximation, and the ellipsis stands for the nonlinear\n\nFIG. 2: Scalability of the structure: Two-qubit operations\nbetween the TLSs on different CBJJs (j = 1, . . . , N ) are enabled by the common LC circuit, which is capacitively coupled\nto the CBJJs. The Josephson energy, capacitance, and bias\ncurrent of the jth CBJJ are Ej , Cj , Ij resp.\n\n\f4\ncorrections. After introducing the Bose operators a and\na\u2020 via \u03c6\u0302j = \u039bj (aj + a\u2020j )/2, p\u0302j = h\u0304(aj \u2212 a\u2020j )/(i\u039bj ), \u039bj =\n\u00011/2\n\u22121\n, the Hamiltonian becomes\n(2h\u0304Cjj\n)/\u03c9j\nH=\n\nN\nX\n\nN\n\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\nX\n1\nh\u0304\u03c9j (a\u2020j aj + )\u2212\ngjk aj \u2212 a\u2020j ak \u2212 a\u2020k +* * *\n2\nj=0\nk>j=0\n\nwith the effective coupling\nh\n\u0001 i\n\u22121\n\u22121 \u22121 1/2\ngjk = h\u0304(\u03c9j \u03c9k )1/2 Cjk\n/ 2 Cjj\nCkk\n.\nBy assumption, \u03c90 \u226b \u03c9j , j = 1, . . . N . Therefore the\nHamiltonian can be projected on the ground state of the\nLC bus [12]. The nonlinearity of the CBJJ allows us to\nfurther restrict the Hamiltonian to the subspace spanned\nby the states |0i, |1i of each CBJJ, producing\nHeff =\n\nN\nN\nX\n1X\nh\u0304\u03c9j \u03c3zj +\ngjk \u03c3yj \u03c3yk .\n2 j=1\n\n(8)\n\nk>j=1\n\nIn the interaction representation with respect to H0 =\nP\nN\nj\nj\nj\nj=1 h\u0304\u03c9j \u03c3z it is easy to see that \u03c3y (t) = \u03c3y (0) cos \u03c9j t+\n\u03c3xj (0) sin \u03c9j t [13]. Therefore, the pairwise couplings in (8)\nwill only be effective for the CBJJ tuned in resonance\nwith each other, in which case (\u03c9j = \u03c9k ) the effective\n\u0001\njk\ninteraction term is H\u0303eff\n= gjk \u03c3xj \u03c3xk + \u03c3yj \u03c3yk /2. On the\nsubspace spanned by the states\u0001 |0ij \u2297 |1ik and |1ij \u2297\n|0ik the operator \u03c3xj \u03c3xk + \u03c3yj \u03c3yk /2 acts as \u03c3x (while it\nis exactly zero outside). Therefore this coupling allows\nthe same universal two-CBJJ manipulations as in [11].\nUniversal two-qubit gates on TLSs situated in different\nCBJJs can then be performed by transferring the states\nof the TLS1,2 to the corresponding CBJJ1,2 , performing\nthe two-qubit operations on the states of CBJJ1,2 , and\nretransferring the resulting states back to the TLSs.\nThe number of TLS per CBJJ is of order 10 and depends on the fabrication. The decoherence times of TLSs\nare determined by their local environment and are insensitive to the number of CBJJs linked to the same LC circuit. Similarly, the influence of the LC circuit on the decoherence of the CBJJ is negligible as long as \u03c90 \u226b \u03c910 \u223c\n\u03c9p [4], the same requirement we need to obtain the coujk\npling H\u0303eff\n. Therefore the scalability of the system is lim\u2032\nited by the condition [L(C0 + N C1,eff\n)]\u22121 \u226b Ic /[\u03a60 C1 ],\nor, to the same accuracy, N \u226a [\u03a60 /LIc ] [C1 /C1\u2032 ] . Therefore N can be of order few dozen without violating the\napplicability conditions for the above scalable design.\nThe usefulness of TLSs for our purpose could be questioned because their parameters undergo spontaneous\nchanges. Nevertheless, since such changes typically happen on the scale of days [15], a pre-run calibration is\nsufficient for any realistic task. Another concern that\ncould be raised is the fact that any operation on the\nTLSs is done through the CBJJ, so that the latter's decoherence must be a limiting factor on the number of\n1\n2\n\noperations that can be performed on the TLSs, no matter how long their decoherence times are. However, an\nimportant point to note here is that in the above design\nwith N CBJJs, only one or two of them are used during\nany gate operation. Therefore, the decoherence time of\nthe entire system is of the order of TdCBJJ rather than\nTdCBJJ /N , which one would normally obtain when using\nN CBJJs as phase qubits.\nIt is worth noting that there is some control, albeit very\nlimited, over the properties of the TLSs (e.g. the number\nof TLSs in a CBJJ was drastically reduced by using a\ndifferent barrier material [3]). They will not be the only\nnaturally formed objects to allow quantum manipulation.\nA case in point is the observation of Rabi oscillations in\nself-assembled quantum dots [14].\nSummary.- In conclusion, we have demonstrated that\nquantum two-level systems (TLSs) naturally occurring\nin CBJJs can be used as qubits. The one- and twoqubit gates, initialization and readout can be readily performed, and the system can be scaled beyond a single\nCBJJ. Being microscopis objects, TLSs have a higher\nprobability of possessing long decoherence times, which\nare only weakly affected by the TLS-CBJJ interactions,\ndue to that interaction being switched off for most of\nthe time. The tunability of the CBJJs compensates for\nour currently limited control over the parameters of the\nTLSs. In any case, both our numerical simulations and\nespecially the observation of quantum beats between TLS\nand CBJJ [2] show that the experimental realization of\nour scheme is within the reach of current experiments [3].\nWe are grateful to M.
