They are driven by quantum fluctuations\nthat are induced by a change either of coupling constants or\nexternal parameters of the system [1, 2]. The criticality in the\nphenomena of phase transition is in general governed by a diverging correlation length and, specially in the case of QPT, it\nhas been conjectured that a quantum correlation with no classical counterpart - the entanglement - must play a crucial role\n[3]. The methods used to study phase transitions in statistical mechanics required the introduction of new concepts from\nquantum information theory to characterize and classify the\ncritical ground states at the QPT [4]. Seminal articles on spin\nsystems undergoing QPT [3, 5] have motivated an enormous\namount of work aiming at properly defining the role of entanglement in QFTs. For example, the occurrence of some QPT\nare indicated by non-analyticity of entanglement measures\nnear the quantum critical point [4, 6, 7]. However, there is\nno one-to-one correspondence between quantum phase transitions and the non-analyticity of entanglement measures when\napproaching the quantum critical point [8].\nAmong the most studied systems presenting collective\nquantum phenomena in atomic physics and quantum optics,\nthe Dicke model (DM) stands out [9, 10]. It comprises a system of N two-level atoms interacting with a single quantized\nelectromagnetic mode, and it undergoes the QFT known as\nsuper-radiant phase transition [11\u201313]. The finite temperature\nphase transition in the thermodynamic limit of large-N and\nweak coupling of DM was in the seventies [14, 15]. More\nrecently, the role of this QFT on quantum chaos signatures\nhas been analyzed [16\u201320], the exact expression for the scaled\nconcurrence obtained [21], and the scaling of relevant physical quantities determined [22, 23]. Universality of these results has been extended to the case of inhomogeneous coupling [24]. On the practical side, some alternative physical\nimplementations of effective DM have been proposed in different settings such as atom-optical systems with multilevel\natoms and cavity-mediated Raman transitions [25], or even\nsolid-state devices involving superconducting qubits [26].\nAnother recent issue related to QPT is the question of how\n\na system coupled to a critical bath will behave as the bath\nundergoes a QPT. Topics such as decoherence, the decay of\nLoshmidt echo, and entanglement have been studied in systems coupled to a surrounding environment that presents a\nQPT [27\u201332]. In this article, we address this issue of quantum dynamics of a system coupled to critical reservoir. We\nconsider the Dicke model as a structured bath to which a further oscillator is coupled. For this choice, we were inspired\nby typical optomechanical systems where the electromagnetic\nfield couples to the mechanical vibrational motion of a mirror\nsubjected to a linear restoring force [33\u201335], and we attempt\nto answer the question: What happens to the moving mirror\nwhen the field and atoms enclosed in the the cavity undergo\nthe super radiant phase transition? We show that this QFT\ninduces an effective classical non fluctuating driving force on\nthe mirror. This result differs from the common case of a bath\nof harmonic oscillators, for example, where the presence of\nthe reservoir causes a fluctuating driving force responsible for\nthe decoherence of the system.\nThis article is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we describe\nthe optomechanical system used in this work. In Sec. III, we\ndiscuss the thermodynamical limit of this system, and present\nthe response of the moving mirror to the super radiant quantum phase transition. In Sec. IV, we summarize our results.\nSemiclassical calculations are shown in the Appendix.\nII.\n\nMODEL SETUP\n\nIn the Dicke model, an ensemble of N two-level atoms is\ncoupled to a single-mode quantized electromagnetic field in a\ncavity. Such a model contains a QFT from the normal phase\nto the super-radiant phase through variation of the strength of\nthe coupling constants between the field and the atoms [11\u2013\n13]. The model is described by the Dicke Hamiltonian which\nis given by [9, 10] (~ = 1)\n\u03bb\nHD = \u03c9a\u2020 a + \u03c90 Jz + \u221a (a\u2020 + a)(J+ + J\u2212 ),\nN\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\n\u03c9=\n\nn\u03c0C\nL\n\n(n = 1, 2, 3, . . .)\n\n(2)\n\n\f2\nis the angular frequency of the electromagnetic field mode defined by fixing n (with creation and annihilation operators a\u2020\nand a, respectively), C the speed of light, L distance between\nthe mirrors, \u03c90 is the level-splitting of the two-level atoms,\n{J+ , J\u2212 , Jz } the collective atomic operators satisfying the\nusual commutation relations of angular momentum, and\n\u03bb = \u2118E sin(kx0 ),\n\n(3)\n\nis the coupling constant between the atoms and the cavity field,\np with \u2118 the atomic electric dipole matrix element,\nE = \u03c9/\u01eb0 L the r.m.s. vacuum electric field amplitude, \u01eb0\nthe vacuum electric permittivity constant, and x0 the position\nof the atoms in the cavity axis.\nNotice that we have assumed identical coupling constants\n\u03bb (same position x0 ) for all atoms. This means that we are\nconsidering an atomic gas confined in a region of small extent\nas compared with the cavity size L. This assumption is standard in the treatment of the Dicke model [19, 21, 27]. For a\nmore general setup where the atoms spread in a considerable\nregion of the cavity (gas of large extent), it turns out that the\ncritical behavior is essentially the same as that in the ordinary\nmodel as long as the calculations are done with the average\ncoupling constant [24]. It is worthwhile to mention that the\ngeneralization for a traveling quantized field presents an even\nricher phase structure when a gas of large extent is considered\n[36], and that the inclusion of atomic motion leads to modified\nnormal and superradiant phases [37].\nWe now consider that one of the mirrors is allowed to move\nunder the action of a linear restoring force, as depicted in\nFig. 1. This can be achieved, for example, by mounting\nthe mirror on a cantilever. The strong coupling regime between a mode of the cavity electromagnetic field and the vibrational motion of the mirror has already been experimentally realized [34]. Let us denote the angular frequency of\n\nchanges on the strength of the atom-field coupling \u03bb. Let us\nnow derive such Hamiltonian. Due to the mirror motion, the\ncavity changes it length from L to L + Xm . Considering the\noscillations very small as compared to L, Hamiltonian (1) becomes\n\u0012\n\u0013\nn\u03c0c\nXm\nH =\n1\u2212\na \u2020 a + \u03c9 m c \u2020 c + \u03c9 0 Jz\nL\nL\n\u2118E\n+ \u221a [sin(kx0 ) \u2212 Xm \u03b4](a\u2020 + a)(J+ + J\u2212 ),\nN\n(4)\nwhere k = n\u03c0/L and \u03b4 = [sin(kx0 ) + kx0 cos(kx0 )]/L, and\nwe also included the free term \u03c9m c\u2020 c. We notice that besides\nthe radiation-pressure interaction part, a three-body interaction term also appears. Let us rewrite the above Hamiltonian\nas\n\u03bb\nH = \u03c9a\u2020 a + \u03c9m c\u2020 c + \u03c90 Jz + \u221a (a\u2020 + a)(J+ + J\u2212 )\nN\n\u03b7\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2212ga a(c + c) \u2212 \u221a (c + c)(a\u2020 + a)(J+ + J\u2212 ),\nN\n(5)\np\np\nwhere g = \u03c9/[L (2m\u03c9m )] and \u03b7 = \u2118E\u03b4/ (2m\u03c9m ). Depending on the specific choices of the system parameters,\none or another term may dominate. We choose to work\nwith the two-body radiation-pressure term, since it has already been experimentally realized [34]. To compare the relative importance of these terms, we need to consider \u03b7/g =\nE\u2118\n\u03c9L [sin(kx0 ) + kx0 cos(kx0 )]. For example, for the fundamental mode n = 1, we can see that \u03b7/g = 0 for kx0 \u2248\n2.02876. This means positioning the atoms around 2L/3.\nWith this choice, the system Hamiltonian reduces to\n\u03bb\nH = \u03c9a\u2020 a + \u03c9m c\u2020 c + \u03c90 Jz + \u221a (a\u2020 + a)(J+ + J\u2212 )\nN\ng0 \u2020 \u2020\n\u2212 a a(c + c),\nN\n(6)\nwhere we define g0 = gN . Now the dependence of the radiation pressure coupling on N , arising from the density of\natoms \u03c1 = N/L, appears explicitly in the Hamiltonian.\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) A collection of N two-level atoms interact\nwith a single-mode quantized cavity field. The cavity has one of its\nmirrors fixed and the other is allowed to move under the action of a\nlinear restoring force which causes vibration of the moving mirror.\n\nvibrational motion by \u03c9m , and the associated creation and annihilation operators by c\u2020 and c, respectively. This motion\ninduces the expected optomechanical radiation-pressure interaction which couples thepcavity photon number a\u2020 a to the position Xm = (c\u2020 + c)/ (2m\u03c9m ) of the mechanical oscillator, where m the effective mirror mass. However, the mirror\nvibration also induces a three-body interaction as previously\nnoted for one-atom case [38]. The physical reason behind the\nappearance of this coupling is that once the mirror moves, the\nspatial profile of the cavity field is slightly modified causing\n\nIII. EFFECTIVE DRIVING FORCE ON THE MIRROR\n\nWe are interested in the thermodynamical limit of this\nHamiltonian, where the QFT effectively takes place. The\nmathematical procedure to reach this limit in each phase of\nthe Dicke model is thoroughly explained in [19], therefore,\nwe shall present here only the points needed to understand\nour model which includes an extra oscillator.\nFirst, we perform the Holstein-Primakoff transformation\ndefined as\np\n(7)\nJ+ = b \u2020 N \u2212 b \u2020 b\nN\n(8)\nJz = b \u2020 b \u2212 ,\n2\n\n\f3\nwhere the set of atoms is described by bosonic operators b\u2020 , b,\nsatisfying [b, b\u2020 ] = 1. After performing this transformation,\nthe system Hamiltonian becomes (up to constant terms)\ng0\nH = \u03c9a\u2020 a + \u03c90 b\u2020 b + \u03c9m c\u2020 c \u2212 a\u2020 a(c\u2020 + c)\nN\n!\nr\nr\n\u2020b\nb\nb\u2020 b\n\u2020\n\u2020\n+ 1\u2212\nb . (9)\n+\u03bb(a + a) b 1 \u2212\nN\nN\nNow the system Hamiltonian is in a suitable form for the\nthermodynamic limit to be applied. The Dicke Hamiltonian\npresents two phases, and the physical features of these phases\nmotivates the mathematical treatment of the thermodynamical\n\u221a\nlimit. In the normal phase \u03bb < \u03bbc , where \u03bbc = \u03c9\u03c90 /2, the\nsimple application of the limit in the Hamiltonian (9) leads directly to the correct effective Hamiltonian of the normal phase\nDicke\nHnp = Hnp\n+ \u03c9m c\u2020 c,\n\n(10)\n\nDicke\nHnp\n= \u03c9a\u2020 a + \u03c90 b\u2020 b + \u03bb(a\u2020 + a)(b\u2020 + b).\n\n(11)\n\nwhere\n\nWe can see that in the normal phase, the moving mirror effectively decouples from the Dicke system and evolves as a free\nharmonic oscillator. We interpret this as a consequence from\nthe fact that the Dicke system is only microscopically excited\nin the normal phase.\nOn the other hand, for \u03bb > \u03bbc we must incorporate the\nfact that both the field and the atomic gas acquire macroscopic\noccupations. This motivates\nthe displacement\n\u221aof the bosonic\n\u221a\nmodes as a\u2020 \u2192 a\u2020 + \u03b1 and b\u2020 \u2192 b\u2020 \u2212 \u03b2 [19]. If the\ndisplacement constants are chosen as\n\u221a\n\u03bbp\n\u03b1 =\nN (1 \u2212 \u03bc2 )\n\u03c9\nr\np\nN\n\u03b2 =\n(1 \u2212 \u03bc),\n2\n\n(12)\n(13)\n\nwhere \u03bc = \u03c9\u03c90 /4\u03bb2 = (\u03bbc /\u03bb)2 , and we set the terms with\noverall powers of N in the denominator to zero after expanding the square roots in Hamiltonian (9) considering large N ,\nwe obtain (up to constant terms)\nDicke\nHsrp = Hsrp\n+ \u03c9 m c\u2020 c \u2212\n\ng0 \u03bb2\n(1 \u2212 \u03bc2 )(c\u2020 + c),(14)\n\u03c92\n\nwhere\n\u03c90\n(1 + \u03bc)b\u2020 b +\n2\u03bc\n\u03c90 (1 \u2212 \u03bc)(3 + \u03bc) \u2020\n+\n(b + b)2\n8\u03bc(1 + \u03bc)\nr\n2\n+\u03bb\u03bc\n(a\u2020 + a)(b\u2020 + b).\n1+\u03bc\n\nDicke\nHsrp\n= \u03c9a\u2020 a +\n\n(15)\n\nTherefore, in the super-radiant phase the moving mirror also\neffectively decouples from the Dicke system, but it suffers the\nconsequences of the field and atoms being macroscopically\n\nexcited. This is translated as an effective classical driving\nforce acting on the mirror.\nThis is a very interesting point because an ordinary thermal\nreservoir would never drive coherent oscillations, even at zero\ntemperature. There is a special combination of facts leading\nto this particular effect in this optomechanical setup as we are\nnow going to explain. It is well known that the coupling to a\nquantum environment results in a fluctuating force acting on\nthe system and reflecting the characteristics of the reservoir\n[39]. It is precisely the nature of the force fluctuations that\ncause decoherence and damping. On the other hand, if the\nnumber of elements in the reservoir is small, energy can be\ntransfered from the system to the reservoir and then fed back\nto the system (Poincar\u00e9 recurrence) in a period relevant to the\nnatural time scales of the problem. In cases where the system\nis coupled to a huge reservoir, the Poincar\u00e9 recurrence time\nwill tend to infinity. When thinking in terms of a reservoirinduced fluctuating force on the system, the former case corresponds to a practically not-fluctuating force. In the optomechanical system treated here, the mirror is coupled solely to\na single member of the elements composing the critical reservoir, namely the electromagnetic field. Therefore, Poincar\u00e9\nrecurrences will take place, explaining the energy oscillation\nof the mirror system, i.e., the fact that c\u2020 c is no longer a constant of movement. This still does not explain why the mirror does not suffer minimal decoherence, something expected\nwhen the reservoir is traced out, even if it contains only a single element. The point is that the atoms work as a reservoir\nfor\n\u221a\nthe field causing it to behave classically, i.e., a \u2192 \u03b1 such\nthat\ng0 \u2020 \u2020\ng0\na a(c + c) \u2192 \u03b1(c\u2020 + c).\nN\nN\n\n(16)\n\nThis is consistent with the fact that the macroscopic excitation in the field is given by ha\u2020 ai/J = \u03b1/J (with 2J = N )\nin the super radiant phase [19].\n\u221a From the point of view of\nthe displacement a\u2020 \u2192 a\u2020 + \u03b1, it follows that, in the thermodynamical limit, the vacuum fluctuations in the field are\nnegligible concerning the interaction with the mirror.\nAs an alternative way of showing the macroscopic limit of\nthe Dicke system, we present in the appendix A a study of\nthe classical analogue of the present model. This method has\nbeen used to study chaos [17, 19] and the bifurcation of the\nequilibrium in the ground state [18] in the Dicke model. It\ngives reliable results in the large N limit of scalable systems\nlike the Dicke model.\nFrom all of this, it follows that the vibrational motion of\nthe mirror can then work as a probe to the super radiant phase\ntransition. If \u03bb < \u03bbc , the average occupation hc\u2020 ci(t) will be\ntime independent according to Hamiltonian (10), whereas just\nabove the critical point, the mirror starts to evolve under\nHmirror = \u03c9m c\u2020 c + \u03a9(c\u2020 + c),\n2\n\n(17)\n\nwith \u03a9 = \u2212 g\u03c90 \u03bb2 (1 \u2212 \u03bc2 ), and it will cause the average occupation of the vibrational levels to change in time. For example,\nDicke\nif the Dicke system is initially in the ground state of Hsrp\n\n\f4\n\nhc\u2020 ci(t) =\n\n2\u03a92\n[1 \u2212 cos(\u03c9m t)] ,\n2\n\u03c9m\n\n(18)\n\nfor \u03bb > \u03bbc . Of course, it is not really necessary to cool down\nthe mirror at first place. Any initial state would be good because what matters is that c\u2020 c is a constant of motion only\nin the normal phase according to our findings. Consequently,\nonly in the super radiant phase of the structured bath we will\nbe able to see some dynamics of this observable.\nThe above behavior in the super-radiant phase is numerically evidenced in Fig.2 for the mean occupation number\nhc\u2020 ci(t) simulated with Hamiltonian (6). The system has been\ninitially prepared in the state |\u03a8(0)i = |groundiDicke \u2297 |0ic ,\nwhere |groundiDicke and |0ic are the ground states of (1) and\nHm = \u03c9m c\u2020 c, respectively. Although far from the thermodynamic limit, we can already see that as J increases, the oscillations tend to the regular energy oscillation (18) of the forced\nharmonic oscillator. The simulation with finite J was performed using standard diagonalization packages. When mapping the atomic Pauli operators to collective angular momentum operators, it is easy to see that the basis for treating the\natomic part in the Dicke system has actually dimension 2J +1,\nwhere J = N/2. Consequently, cases with J about 15 are\namenable to implementation in current personal computers.\nThere is here, of course, the complication that the basis for\nthe whole system includes also the field and the mirror subsystems. However, since we are simulating just the cases in\nwhich the initial state comprises the fundamental state of the\nDicke system and the vacuum state of the mirror, the numerical calculations converge quickly without the need to drastically increase the basis dimension.\n! 1\n=10\n=6\n=2\n\n0.14\n\n0.12\n\nhc\u2020 ci(t)\n\n0.10\n\n0.08\n\n0.06\n\n0.04\n\n0.02\n\n0.00\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nunder the presence of the Dicke system (reservoir).

CONCLUSIONS AND FINAL REMARKS\n\nWe have presented a new effect in optomechanics, which is\na super-radiance generated classical driving force on a moving\nmirror. We started from the Dicke Hamiltonian and derived an\neffective Hamiltonian considering harmonic motion of one of\nthe mirrors composing the cavity. The subsequent application\nof the thermodynamical limit reveals the appearance of a driving force on the moving mirror in the super-radiant phase of\nthe Dicke system, without causing any coherence loss during\nthe time evolution of the mirror state. Although the thermodynamical limit of this system may not be completely under the\nreach of present technology, we expect that the tendency of\nthe mirror to appear driven in one phase and free in the other\n1\nmay soon be observed in the regime of few atoms in optomechanical systems of the type reported in [40].\n\n\u03c9t\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Time evolution of mean occupation number\nhc\u2020 ci(t) for increasing values of J. It is clear the the curves tend to\nthe driven case (18) found in the thermodynamical limit (TL). The\nsystem parameters are \u03c9 = \u03c90 = 10\u03c9m and \u03bb = 0.6 (super radiant\nphase).\n\nAccording to our findings, the reservoir does not induce decoherence on the mirror in the thermodynamical limit. This\ncan be seem from the fact that there are no products of a or\nb with c in Hamiltonians (10) and (14). Consequently, the\ninitial amount of entropy of the mirror state will not change\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nK.F. wishes to thank M. C.

This method produces for the normalized\ncoherent states representation the following classical Hamiltonian (in units of ~ = 1 = m):\nH = hza , w, zc |H|za , w, zc i\n\u03c9\n\u03c9m 2\n\u03c90 2\n(q + p21 ) \u2212 J\u03c9 + (q22 + p22 ) +\n(q3 + p23 )\n=\n2 1\n2\n2\n\u221a\n2\u03bb p\ng0 2 2\n2J \u2212 H1 q1 q2 \u2212\n+\u221a\n(q2 + p22 )q3 , (A1)\n4J\n2J\n\nwhere H is given by (6), H1 = (q12 + p21 )/2, and the coherent states |za , w, zc i are defined as |za , w, zc i = |za i \u2297\n\u2020\n|wi \u2297 |zc i where |zd i = e(zd \u2212z\u0304d) |0i(d = a, c) and |wi =\n1\nwJ+\n|J, \u2212Ji. The phase space coordinates (q1 , p1 )\n(1+w w\u0304)J e\nand (q2 , p2 ) (similarly for (q3 , p3 ) with zc ) read [42]\nr\nJ\n(w + w\u0304).\nq1 =\n1 + ww\u0304\nr\nJ\n(w \u2212 w\u0304)\np1 =\n.\n(A2)\n1 + ww\u0304\ni\nr\n1\n(za + z \u0304a ),\nq2 =\n2\nr\n1 (za \u2212 z \u0304a )\np2 =\n,\n2\ni\n(A3)\n\nIn the macroscopic limit\u221a(N = 2J \u2192 \u221e), and below crit\u03c9 \u03c9\nical coupling \u03bb < \u03bbc = 20 where no bifurcation of the\nminimum energy fixed point occurs, one can see from the last\ntwo equations that the oscillator with frequency \u03c9m decouples\nfrom the rest of the system and follows free evolution.\nOn the other hand, at \u03bb = \u03bbc a pitchfork bifurcation occurs for the Dicke model lowest energy fixed point [18], such\nthat the stable fixed points for \u03bb \u2265 \u03bb\nqc are (q10 , p10 ) =\np\n2\n(\u2213 2J(1 \u2212 \u03bc), 0) and (q20 , p20 ) = (\u00b1 4J \u03c9\u03bb 2 (1 \u2212 \u03bc2 ), 0).\nAs a kind of first order perturbation theory, we may use this\nvalues into the last two equations in (A4), and this leads naturally to a forced harmonic oscillator equation in the limit\nN \u2192 \u221e:\n\nq\u03083 +\n\n2\n\u03c9m\nq3\n\n=\n\n\u001a\n\n0, if\u03bb \u2264 \u03bbc ,\n\u221a\n2\n2\u03c9m g0 \u03c9\u03bb 2 (1 \u2212 \u03bc2 ),\n\nif\u03bb \u2265 \u03bbc .\n\n(A5)\n\nNow, it is clear that, at least for small g0 -coupling, the driving\nterm has the same form as indicated in Sec. III, i.e. propor2\ntional to \u03a9 = \u2212g0 \u03c9\u03bb 2 (1\u2212\u03bc2 ) and consistent with the quantum\nHamiltonian (17).\n\nAccording to (A1), the associated classical equations of\nmotion are given by\nq\u03071 =\n\u1e571 =\nq\u03072 =\n\u1e572 =\nq\u03073 =\n\u1e573 =\n\np1 q1 q2\n\u03bb\n\u03c9 0 p1 \u2212 \u221a \u221a\n2J 2J \u2212 H1\n2\u03bb p\n\u03bb\nq 2 q2\n\u2212\u03c90 q1 \u2212 \u221a\n2J \u2212 H1 q2 + \u221a \u221a 1\n2J\n2J 2J \u2212 H1\n\u221a\ng0 2\np2 q3\n\u03c9p2 \u2212\n2J\n\u221a\n2\u03bb p\ng0 2\n2J \u2212 H1 q1 +\n\u2212\u03c9q2 \u2212 \u221a\nq2 q3\n2J\n2J\n\u03c9 m p3\n\u221a\ng0 2 2\n\u2212\u03c9m q3 +\n(q2 + p22 ).\n(A4)\n4J\n\n[1] S.

[25],\nwhere it has\nqbeen shown that the transition point is shifted\n2\n\nto \u03bbc = 21 \u03c9\u03c90 (1 + \u03c9\u03ba2 ), where \u03ba is the loss rate.

For small\nlosses (\u03ba \u226a \u03c9), the right hand side of above Eq. (A5) can be\n\u221a\n2\n2\nsubstituted by 2\u03c9m g0 \u03c9\u03bb 2 (1 \u2212 \u03bc2 )(1 \u2212 \u03c9\u03ba2 ). Since the mean\nphoton number in the super radiant ground state is written as\nq2 +p2\nza za\u2217 = 20 2 20 and this is diminished for \u03ba > 0, the force\nacting on the mirror in the super radiant phase is also diminished due to dissipation.\n\n[4] L.
