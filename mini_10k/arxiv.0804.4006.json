By now there is strong evidence that there is a huge\nnumber of supersymmetric vacua with negative cosmological constant in which all scalar\nmoduli are stabilized, the so called landscape of string theory. Typical constructions start\nwith a warped Calabi-Yau compactification of type IIB string theory to four dimensions. Some\nof the scalar moduli are stabilized by the addition of fluxes through the compact cycles of the\ninternal manifold and others by various quantum effects. Since supersymmetry is broken in\nthe real world, to make contact with phenomenology it is necessary to extend the previous\nconstructions to non-supersymmetric (meta)stable vacua with small positive cosmological\nconstant. For this we need to understand the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking in\nstring theory. By now several methods of supersymmetry breaking for string vacua have been\nproposed, such as the introduction of anti-branes [3, 4], or simply the existence of metastable\npoints of the flux-induced potential [5, 6]. The main drawback of these constructions is that,\nin most cases, they are not under complete quantitative control.\nWhile the question of supersymmetry breaking should be ultimately understood in an honest compactification, that is in a theory including gravity in four dimensions, it is technically\neasier to study simpler systems where the gravitational dynamics has been decoupled from the\ngauge theory degrees of freedom. This typically happens in the limit where a local singularity\ndevelops in the Calabi-Yau manifold. In such a situation all the interesting dynamics related\n\n2\n\n\fto the degrees of freedom of the singularity takes place at energy scales much lower than the\nfour dimensional Planck scale. Assuming that supersymmetry breaking is related to these\nlight degrees of freedom, it is then possible to zoom in towards the singularity and forget\nabout the rest of the Calabi-Yau. This leads us to the study of supersymmetry breaking\nand string phenomenology in the context of local Calabi-Yau geometries possibly with the\naddition of probe D3-branes [7, 8, 9, 10, 11].\nMeanwhile a new important aspect of supersymmetry breaking in gauge theories was developed after the discovery of Intriligator, Seiberg and Shih [12] that even simple supersymmetric\ngauge theories can exhibit dynamical supersymmetry breaking in metastable vacua. From a\nphenomenological point of view this possibility is quite attractive, and a lot of activity has\nbeen concentrated around extensions of the ISS model and various related string theory constructions [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22] (see also [23]). A certain class of gauge theories\nwhere supersymmetry breaking in metastable vacua can be studied with good control is that\nof N = 2 gauge theories perturbed by a small superpotential, initiated by [24]. In such theories the exact K\u00e4hler metric on the moduli space is known, which allows one to compute\nthe scalar potential produced by the perturbation of the theory by a small superpotential\n\nexactly to first order in the perturbation. It was shown that generically there are metastable\nsupersymmetry breaking vacua generated by appropriate superpotentials. We will refer to\nthis as the OOP mechanism for supersymmetry breaking in N = 2 theories.\nString theory in a local Calabi-Yau singularity realizes geometric aspects of supersymmetric gauge theories. In particular the question of supersymmetry breaking in these two\nsystems should be related. The first goal of our paper is to make this connection more precise by giving a geometric realization of the OOP supersymmetry breaking mechanism in IIB\non a local Calabi-Yau singularity. To realize OOP one first has to engineer the (IR of the)\nN = 2 gauge theory and then to find a way of introducing the appropriate superpotential.\n\nThe first step is achieved by the standard geometric engineering of N = 2 gauge theories by\nIIB on noncompact Calabi-Yau manifolds [25, 26]. It is well known that the moduli space of\nthe Calabi-Yau compactification encodes the geometry of the Coulomb branch of the gauge\ntheory and that the Seiberg-Witten solution can be rederived by the complex geometry of the\nCalabi-Yau.\nThe introduction of superpotential to this system is less straightforward and, to our knowledge, has not been studied in the literature before, in this context. Our main proposal is that\nthe superpotential can be introduced by turning on 3-form flux in the local Calabi-Yau, which\nis not piercing its compact 3-cycles, but which is growing in the noncompact direction of the\nCalabi-Yau. In other words, it is flux which has support at infinity. While this flux is not\n3\n\n\fdirectly piercing the compact cycles we show that, once appropriately regularized, it does introduce an effective superpotential for the complex structure moduli, which is generalization\nof the usual Gukov-Vafa-Witten superpotential [27, 28, 29] to 3-form flux with noncompact\nsupport. This is a way to introduce a general superpotential in a geometrically engineered\nN = 2 gauge theory. In particular, we explain that in certain cases it is possible to engineer\n\nthe OOP-type superpotential, which guarantees the existence of metastable, supersymmetry\nbreaking vacua for the complex structure moduli.\n\nThe second goal of our paper is to find a \"natural\" way to generate the supersymmetry\nbreaking flux configurations described above, starting from a more standard setup. In this\nprocess, we also clarify the meaning of flux which has noncompact support and the various\nsubtleties related to it1 . The natural interpretation of the flux described in the previous\nparagraph emerges once we embed the previous supersymmetry-breaking local singularity into\na bigger IIB compactification with standard flux of compact support. As shown in figure 1,\nthe physical idea is to start with a Calabi-Yau manifold with a set of three-cycles which are\nisolated from the other three-cycles by a large distance. We turn on 3-form flux on all cycles\nexcept for the isolated set. While the flux that we have turned on is not piercing the isolated\ncycles, it does leak into their region2 and it produces a potential for their complex structure\nmoduli. In the limit where the distance between the two sets of cycles of the Calabi-Yau\nbecomes very large, which we will refer to as the factorization limit, the flux leaking towards\nthe isolated set will start to look like the flux coming from infinity, mentioned in the previous\nparagraph. In this way we manage to embed the scenario of the previous paragraph into a\nwell defined system. While this factorization idea should work even in the case where the\ntotal Calabi-Yau is a compact manifold divided into two parts, 3 in this paper we will only\nanalyze it in the local case, as it is technically easier.\nAs a check of this, we consider the example of a local Calabi-Yau based on a hyperelliptic\nRiemann surface. In this case the factorization can be studied more explicitly. Matrix model\ntechniques can be used to compute the prepotential in the factorization limit. Our results\nverify the general intuition of the last paragraph.\nThe plan of this paper is as follows. In section 2, we review some general aspects of\nIIB flux compactifications and the potentials that can be generated by noncompact fluxes in\nthe local limit. We also discuss the general mechanism by which such fluxes may be used\n1\n\nFor example the fact that naively the total energy density in four dimensions diverges.\nThis means that the 3-form field strength is nonzero in the region around the isolated set of 3-cycles, but\nonce integrated over one of these 3-cycles the integral is zero.\n3\nBecause of no-go theorems [30, 31, 32], in such compact setups one will need extra ingredients such as\nO-planes, which we do not consider in the present paper.\n2\n\n4\n\n\fFigure 1: Idea of the paper: In I we start with a generic Calabi-Yau with flux\npiercing through some of its 3-cycles, while making the distance between the cycles\nwith and without flux very large in II. This is seen as flux from infinity in the left\nsector without compact flux in III, and generates an OOP-like potential in that\nsector.\n\nto stabilize complex structure moduli in metastable supersymmetry-breaking configurations.\nAfter this, we turn in section 3 to the study of local Calabi-Yau geometries based on Riemann\nsurfaces, providing a more detailed description of the generation of metastable vacua in this\ncontext and providing an explicit example. Section 4 then addresses the second point of this\npaper, namely the ability to obtain our local geometries with noncompact fluxes from larger\nCalabi-Yau with compact ones by taking a factorization limit. Section 5 supplements this\ngeneral discussion by providing an explicit demonstration, using matrix model techniques, of\nthe factorization limit in the class of local geometries studied in section 3. Finally, we finish\nin section 6 with some concluding remarks concerning the generalization of our story to other\n5\n\n\fN = 2 contexts, such as M and F -theory compactifications. Some supplementary material\nand technical details are contained in four appendices. In appendix D, in particular, we study\nprepotential for the Cachazo-Intriligator-Vafa/Dijkgraaf-Vafa geometry using matrix model\nas a step towards confirming the above scenario of realizing metastable vacua by factorization.\nWe compute the prepotential for an arbitrary number of cuts up to fifth order in glueball field.\nAs this paper was being prepared for publication, a paper appeared [33] where a similar\nsystem was studied as an example from a different perspective.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nIIB Compactifications with Flux at Infinity\nCompact Calabi-Yau\n\nCompactification of IIB on a Calabi-Yau threefold M leads to an N = 2 supergravity theory in\n4d. The number of vector multiplets is h2,1 , their scalar components correspond to the complex\nstructure moduli of M. We also have h1,1 + 1 hypermultiplets, whose scalars correspond to\n\nthe K\u00e4hler moduli of M and the axion-dilaton. The two sets of multiplets are decoupled, and\nin the rest of the paper we will concentrate on the dynamics of the vector multiplets.\n\nA Calabi-Yau threefold has a nowhere vanishing holomorphic (3, 0) form \u03a9 which is unique\nup to scale.

We\n\ndefine the periods of \u03a9 as\n\nI\n\nX =\n\nZ\n\n\u03a9,\n\nFI =\n\nAI\n\nZ\n\n\u03a9.\n\n(2.1)\n\nBI\n\nThe A-periods X I are projective coordinates on the complex structure moduli space of M,\nand the FI are functions of X I . The metric on the complex structure moduli space is special\nK\u00e4hler and the K\u00e4hler potential is given by\n\u0013\n\u0012 Z\nK = \u2212 log i \u03a9 \u2227 \u03a9 .\n\n(2.2)\n\nThis is an exact result which does not receive any \u03b1\u2032 or gs corrections.\nThe easiest way to lift the phenomenologically unrealistic moduli space of such compactifications is to turn on fluxes through the compact cycles of the Calabi-Yau. In the case of IIB\nwe can turn on RR and NS-NS 3-form flux F3 and H3 through the 3-cycles of the threefold.\nThis generates a superpotential for the complex structure moduli [27, 28, 29] given by\nZ\nW = G3 \u2227 \u03a9,\n6\n\n(2.3)\n\n\fwhere G3 = F3 \u2212 \u03c4 H3 and \u03c4 = C0 + i/gs . The scalar potential is computed by the standard\nN = 1 supergravity expression4\n\u0010\n\u0011\ne\nV = eK Gab Da W Db W \u2212 3|W |2 ,\n(2.4)\n\ne and where\nwhere Gab is the metric on the moduli space derived from the K\u00e4hler potential K,\ne\nwe have introduced the K\u00e4hler covariant derivative Da W = \u2202a W + (\u2202a K)W\n.\nThe F3 and H3 fluxes generate charge for the F5 form via a Chern-Simons coupling in the\n\n10d IIB supergravity action. The F5 flux has nowhere to end, so we are lead to the tadpole\ncancellation condition for IIB compactifications\nZ\n1\nF3 \u2227 H3 + QD3 = 0,\n(2.5)\nls4\nwhere QD3 receives positive contribution from probe D3 branes and negative contribution\n\nfrom induced charge on D7 and orientifold planes.\n\n2.2\n\nLocal Limit\n\nIt is well known that there are points on the complex structure moduli space of CalabiYau manifolds where the manifold develops a singularity [34]. The simplest example is the\nconifold singularity, where we have a 3-cycle whose size goes to zero. More generally, a more\ncomplicated set of cycles may become very small in some region of the moduli space. As\nwe approach this region, the local dynamics of the singularity decouples from the rest of the\nfields. What this means is that in 4d the typical energy scale for the dynamics of the fields\ncorresponding to the singularity becomes much smaller than any other scale, in particular\nmuch smaller than the Planck mass Mp in 4 dimensions. In this sense, the dynamics of\nthe singularity is decoupled from gravity. Moreover to study the relevant dynamics, we can\nzoom in close to the singularity and forget about the rest of the Calabi-Yau. In this limit\nthe Calabi-Yau looks noncompact, and it becomes technically easier to study the low energy\ndynamics.\nA typical example of such a local Calabi-Yau is a complex manifold of the form of a\nhypersurface in C4\nM:\n\nuv \u2212 F (x, y) = 0,\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhere F (x, y) is a polynomial. In this case the holomorphic 3-form is\n\u03a9=\n\ndu\n\u2227 dx \u2227 dy.\nu\n\n4\n\n(2.7)\n\nIn this expression the indices a, b run over complex structure moduli, K\u00e4hler moduli and the axion-dilaton.\ne the total K\u00e4hler potential for all moduli and by K, as in (2.2), the one for the complex\nWe denote by K\nstructure moduli alone.\n\n7\n\n\fBy taking the local limit to go from a compact Calabi-Yau to a noncompact one, the structure\nof special geometry described above reduces to what is called rigid special geometry [35, 36],\nwhich is relevant for the low energy dynamics of N = 2 gauge theories. In this case the\nK\u00e4hler potential reduces to\n\nK=i\n\nZ\n\n\u03a9 \u2227 \u03a9,\n\n(2.8)\n\nand the K\u00e4hler covariant derivative Di reduces to the ordinary derivative \u2202i .\nAn important point is the distinction between normalizable and non-normalizable complex\nstructure moduli in the case of noncompact Calabi-Yau manifolds. To be more precise let us\nconsider the example (2.6). The coefficients {ti } of the polynomial P (x, y) characterize the\n\ncomplex structure of M, so {ti } are the complex structure moduli of M. However not all\nof them are dynamical. Some of them control the complex structure of 3-cycles which are\nlocalized in the \"interior\" of the singularity and are dynamical, while others describe how\nthe singularity is embedded in the bigger Calabi-Yau and become frozen when we take the\ndecoupling limit.\nTo determine if a specific complex structure modulus t is dynamical or not, one has to\ncompute the corresponding K\u00e4hler metric\nZ\n(2.9)\ngtt = \u2202t \u2202t K = i\u2202t \u2202t \u03a9 \u2227 \u03a9.\n\nIf this expression is finite, then the modulus t is dynamical, otherwise it is decoupled and\n\nshould be treated as a parameter of the theory. We will refer to the first set of moduli as\nnormalizable and to the second as non-normalizable.\n\n2.3\n\nAdding Flux\n\nAs in the compact case, the addition of fluxes to the local Calabi-Yau introduces a superpotential for the moduli. The dynamics of the K\u00e4hler moduli and the dilaton decouple, and we\ncan concentrate on the normalizable complex structure moduli. The superpotential is still\ngiven by (2.3), but now the scalar potential is computed by the rigid N = 2 expression\nZ\ni\uf6be\nV = G \u2202i W \u2202j W = G3 \u2227 \u2217G3 .\n(2.10)\nSince we are in a noncompact Calabi-Yau it is not necessary to impose the tadpole cancellation\ncondition. Instead, the quantity\nZ\nF3 \u2227 H3\n\n(2.11)\n\nrepresents the F5 flux going off to infinity and remains constant as we vary the moduli. We\nwill use this to simplify the potential in the next section.\n8\n\n\fIn most treatments of fluxes in noncompact Calabi-Yau manifolds the assumption is made\nthat the flux is threading the compact cycles of the singularity and is going to zero at infinity.\nAs we explained in the introduction the goal of our paper is to study the dynamics in the case\nwhere the flux is actually coming in from infinity and is not supported on the compact threecycles. Of course, in a local singularity inside a bigger compact Calabi-Yau, what is meant\nby infinity is the rest of the Calabi-Yau and we should think of flux coming from infinity as\nflux leaking towards the singularity from the other compact cycles.\nMore precisely, in a noncompact Calabi-Yau we consider the vector space H 3 (M) of\nharmonic 3-forms which do not necessarily have compact support, so they can grow at infinity.\n3\n(M) \u2282 H 3 (M). There\nThe harmonic 3-forms of compact support form a linear subspace Hcpct\n3\nis a natural way to define the complement subspace H\u221e\n(M) \u2282 H 3 (M) as the harmonic forms\nwith vanishing integrals on the compact 3-cycles5 . Then we have the decomposition\n3\n3\nH 3 (M) = H\u221e\n(M) \u2295 Hcpct\n(M).\n\n(2.12)\n\n3\nWe will also refer to the forms in Hcpct\n(M) as harmonic 3-forms with compact support and\n3\nto those in H\u221e (M) as 3-forms with support at infinity.\n\nNow we want to consider the case where the 3-form field strength that we have turned on\nhas support at infinity\n3\nG3 \u2208 H \u221e\n(M),\n\nwhich means that G3 has zero flux through the compact cycles\nZ\nZ\nG3 =\nG3 = 0.\nAi\n\n(2.13)\n\n(2.14)\n\nBi\n\nThe intuitive picture that one should keep in mind, is that this flux at infinity represents\nusual flux piercing other 3-cycles which are very far away from the singularity in the big\nCalabi-Yau. As we will see in more detail in the next section, in this case and if one zooms\ninto the local singularity it is a good approximation to treat the flux from the distant 3-cycles\n3\n3\nas flux which \"diverges\" at infinity. In other words both H\u221e\n(M) and Hcpct\n(M) correspond\n3\nf\nf\nto the usual H (M) of the bigger Calabi-Yau M in which the singularity M develops.\ncpct\n\nWhat is maybe more surprising is that the 3-form flux G3 with support at infinity generates\n\na potential for the complex structure moduli of the singularity M, even though it is not\n5\n\nWe should clarify that we are not interested in the most general harmonic 3-form with noncompact\nsupport, but only in a restricted subset characterized by 3-forms which grow in a \"controlled\" way at infinity.\nThis means that we want to consider forms which have at most a \"pole\" of finite order at infinity, and not\nessential singularities. This statement has a nice interpretation in the example where we have a local CalabiYau based on a Riemann surface that we will study later. Another way to state this restriction is that we\nwill consider harmonic 3-forms on a local Calabi-Yau which do have a lift to the original Calabi-Yau that we\nstarted with before we took the local limit near its singularity.\n\n9\n\n\fdirectly piercing the compact cycles of M, as can be seen from (2.14). Our starting point for\nthe computation of this potential is the energy stored in the 3-form field\nZ\nVe = G3 \u2227 \u2217G3 .\n(2.15)\n\nSince G3 has noncompact support, this is a divergent integral meaning that the energy of the\n\nflux is infinite. This was to be expected and is not really a problem, since we are interested\nin the changes of this energy as we vary the sizes of the 3-cycles in the neighborhood of the\nsingularity. We would like to throw away the divergent, moduli independent piece of this\nquantity and keep the finite, moduli dependent one. A nice way to achieve this is to use the\nfact that the net F5 form flux leaking off at infinity, being a topological quantity, has to be\nkept constant as we vary the moduli. It is easy to show that we can write\nZ\nZ\nG3 \u2227 G3 = (\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 ) F3 \u2227 H3 ,\n\n(2.16)\n\nand the left hand side must be constant for the reason we explained. Since it is a constant\nwe can subtract it from the potential and define\nZ\nZ\nV \u2261 G3 \u2227 \u2217G3 \u2212 G3 \u2227 G3 .\n(2.17)\nIt is easy to show that this is equal to\n\nV =\n\nZ\n\n\u2212\nG\u2212\n3 \u2227 \u2217G3 ,\n\n(2.18)\n\nwhere G\u2212\n3 is the imaginary anti-self dual part of the G3 flux\n\u2212\n\u2217 G\u2212\n3 = \u2212iG3 .\n\n(2.19)\n\nThe expression (2.18) is the finite and moduli dependent piece of the potential (2.15).\n\n2.4\n\nSimplifying the Potential\n\nIn this section we simplify the expression (2.18) for the potential. In general we have the\nfollowing relation between the Hodge decomposition and the \u2217 operator on a threefold\n\u2217 H 3,0 = \u2212iH 3,0 ,\n\n\u2217H 1,2 = \u2212iH 1,2 ,\n\n\u2217 H 2,1 = iH 2,1 ,\n\n\u2217H 0,3 = iH 0,3 .\n\n(2.20)\n\nBefore we proceed we would like to analyze the relation between the decomposition (2.12)\nand the Hodge decomposition.

Since we do not want to break supersymmetry explicitly by the boundary conditions of the system, we want our configuration to\n\nbe supersymmetric at infinity, which means that the flux at infinity has to be imaginary self\ndual so\n2,1\n1,2\n2,1\nG3 \u2208 H \u221e\n\u2295 Hcpct\n\u2295 Hcpct\n.\n\n(2.22)\n\nwhere the subscript \u221e means that we have to consider the elements of the cohomology with\nnoncompact support.

Such\nflux will make additional contribution to the superpotential of the form N i Fi \u2212 \u03b1i X i , \u03b1i = Bi \u03a9, which\ncannot be controlled by external parameters and makes\nR realization of OOP-like vacua moreR difficult.\n9\nOne quick way to see this is to use the identity M \u039em \u2227 \u2202i \u03a9 = 0 to derive Kim \u223c \u2202M \u039bm \u2227 \u2202i \u03a9 for\na 2-form \u039bm satisfying d\u039bm = \u039em on the boundary (at infinity) of M. Because the divergent contributions\nto \u039bm at infinity can be chosen independent of the dynamical moduli, we can pull the derivative outside of\neverything.\n\n12\n\n\f2.5.1\n\nOOP Mechanism\n\nEquation (2.32) makes manifest the relation between our flux-induced potential (2.30) and\nthat which arises in deformed Seiberg-Witten theory and allows us to utilize the technology developed by Ooguri, Ookouchi, and Park [24] in that context10 for engineering supersymmetrybreaking vacua. In particular, if we want to realize a nonsupersymmetric minimum at some\npoint X i (0) in the moduli space, the OOP procedure tells us to first construct K\u00e4hler normal\ncoordinates [38, 39, 40], around X i (0)\n\u221e\nX\n1\n\u2202i3 . . . \u2202in \u0393\u0303ji1 i2 \u2206X i1 \u2206X i2 . . . \u2206X in ,\nz = \u2206X + g\u0303\nn!\nn=2\ni\n\ni\n\ni\uf6be\u0304\n\n(2.34)\n\nwhere \u2206X i = X i \u2212 X i (0) and  \u0303 means evaluation at X = X (0) . We then build the potential\nV in (2.32) from a superpotential Weff consisting of a linear combination of the z i\nWeff = ki z i ,\n\nki : constant.\n\n(2.35)\n\nStability can then be demonstrated by expanding V near p\n \u0304\n\nV = ki k\u0304\uf6be\u0304 g\u0303 i\uf6be\u0304 + ki k\u0304\uf6be\u0304 R\u0303i\uf6be\u0304kl\u0304 z k z\u0304 l + O(z 3 ).\n\n(2.36)\n\nThe curvature of special K\u00e4hler manifolds, of which the complex structure moduli space is an\nexample, is positive definite at generic points. As a result, any potential of the form (2.32)\nthat agrees with (2.35) near X i (0) to cubic order will engineer a nontrivial vacuum at X i (0) .11\nOne can obtain a nice physical picture for this mechanism by noting, as in [41], that the\nseries (2.34) can be summed exactly and inserted into (2.35) to yield\nWeff \u223c ei X i + mi Fi ,\n\n(2.37)\n\nei + mj \u03c4\u0303 ji = 0.\n\n(2.38)\n\nwhere ei and mj satisfy\nFrom this, we see that the superpotential (2.37) built from K\u00e4hler normal coordinates is of\nprecisely the form that we would have obtained had we instead simply turned on compactlysupported fluxes mi and ei threading the cycles Ai and Bi , respectively. The condition (2.38),\n\nhowever, combined with the requirement that Im \u03c4 be positive definite, implies that ei and mi\n10\n\nSee also related work by Pastras [37].\nFor non-generic X (0) , the curvature may have a zero eigenvalue in which case higher order agreement\nwith (2.35) is required (that X i (0) is a stable for superpotential exactly equivalent to (2.35) will follow from\nthe discussion below).\n11\n\n13\n\n\fcan never satisfy the condition ei + mj \u03c4\u0303ji = 0 that is required for preservation of the manifest\nN = 1 supersymmetry.\nIt is well-known that the flux-induced superpotential (2.37) only breaks the full N = 2\n\nsupersymmetry spontaneously, though, so there is a second N = 1 in the game that is not\nmanifest in this formalism. The relation (2.38) is, in fact, nothing other than the condition\nthat the vacuum at X i (0) preserves precisely these non-manifest supersymmetries [42, 41]. As\nsuch, the vacuum at X i (0) in the presence of the superpotential (2.35) is stable for a good\nreason-it is secretly supersymmetric!\nIn general, our noncompactly supported fluxes will not generate potentials with Weff exactly equivalent to (2.35). Rather, the Weff 's that arise are globally well-defined functions\non the moduli space12 which we can then tune to agree with (2.35) to cubic order within a\nneighborhood of the point X i (0) . The delicate manner by which the superpotential (2.35)\nmanaged to realize a non-manifest N = 2 supersymmetry is crucially dependent on the full\ninfinite series expansion about X i (0) so, by failing to exactly reproduce (2.35), we are able\nto explicitly break, at the level of the Lagrangian, the half of supersymmetry which would\notherwise have been preserved by the vacuum at X i (0) . Stability of the X i (0) vacuum, on\nthe other hand, depends only on the local behavior of Weff so our procedure will retain this\nproperty, leaving us with a locally stable supersymmetry-breaking vacuum.\nIn the end, what we are doing to engineer a supersymmetry-breaking vacuum at X i (0) is\nactually a quite intuitive procedure. We first turn on a collection of noncompactly supported\nfluxes which explicitly break half of the N = 2 supersymmetry. We then tune these fluxes so\n\nthat, near X i (0) , their interactions with the dynamical complex structure moduli mimic those\nof the compactly supported fluxes that would generate a vacuum at X i (0) which preserves the\nopposite half of supersymmetries.\n2.5.2\n\nSupersymmetric Vacua\n\nIn addition to possessing supersymmetry-breaking vacua when the T m are suitably tuned, the\npotential (2.32) also typically contains a wide variety of supersymmetric vacua. As discussed\nin [24], these vacua fall into two different classes. First, because there is no flux directly\nthreading the compact cycles, the energy cost associated with shrinking them is necessarily\nfinite. Because the period matrix \u03c4ij diverges, the potential vanishes at these singular points\nand we obtain stable vacua which are in fact supersymmetric.\nThis argument is of course rather crude because we are neglecting the new light degrees of\nfreedom that enter as 3-cycles degenerate but, as is well-known, this is easily fixed. In particu12\n\nContrast this with (2.37), which manifestly suffer from monodromies for constant (non-transforming) ki .\n\n14\n\n\flar, the light D3 branes which wrap the degenerating cycles give rise to hypermultiplets [43,44]\ncomprised of pairs of N = 1 chiral superfields Qi and Q\u0303i with bilinear superpotential couplings\nto special coordinates. For the simple case of degenerating Ai cycles, the superpotential takes\nthe schematic form\n\nW = Weff (X i ) + (QQ\u0303)i X i ,\n\n(2.39)\n\nand allows a supersymmetric vacuum at X i = 0 through condensation of QQ\u0303\n(QQ\u0303)i = \u2212\n\n\u0001\n\u2202Weff\nXj = 0 .\ni\n\u2202X\n\n(2.40)\n\nThe second class of supersymmetric vacua correspond to solutions of the F -term equations\n\u2202i Weff (X j ) = 0.\n\n(2.41)\n\nIn general, there may be many solutions to these equations, as we will explore later in the\nexample of section 3.2.\n2.5.3\n\nLifetime of Supersymmetry-Breaking Vacua\n\nBecause we have managed to achieve supersymmetry-breaking vacua while freezing all nonnormalizable moduli, the energies V0 will in general be finite and independent of the cutoff\nscale \u039b0 that we use to regulate the local geometry. This means that our vacua are truly\nmetastable, even within this local model, and can decay to any of the supersymmetric vacua\nthat exist in these models. Because the number the supersymmetric vacua is potentially large\nand their properties quite model-dependent, it is difficult to make general statements about\nthe lifetime of our OOP vacua. Nevertheless, we recall here one observation from [24], namely\nthat the decay rates will in general scale like\ne\u2212S ,\n\nS\u223c\n\n(\u2206z)4\n,\nV+\n\n(2.42)\n\nwhere \u2206z is the distance in field space between the initial and final vacuum state and V+\nis the difference in their energies. By simultaneously scaling all T m by a common factor,\nT m \u2192 \u01eb T m , we can retain our supersymmetry-breaking vacua while decreasing V+ by the\nsame factor, V+ \u2192 \u01ebV+ . In this manner, we see that, just as with OOP vacua in deformed\n\nSeiberg-Witten theory, these OOP flux vacua can be made arbitrarily long-lived13 .\n13\n\nBecause we should really think of the local Calabi-Yau as sitting inside some larger compact geometry,\none important caveat to this statement of longevity is that the noncompact fluxes T m in reality derive from\na suitable set of compact fluxes in the full Calabi-Yau. This means that there will be a series of quantization\nconditions that must be imposed that may affect the degree to which they may be tuned.\n\n15\n\n\f3\n\nMetastable Flux Vacua in Local Calabi-Yau\n\nIn the previous section, we saw that, starting from a compact Calabi-Yau and taking a\ndecoupling limit, one ends up with a local Calabi-Yau with noncompact flux with support at\ninfinity, which is nothing but the flux leaking from the rest of the full Calabi-Yau that have\nbeen decoupled, towards \"our\" local Calabi-Yau. Furthermore, this noncompact flux induces\npotential (2.30) for the complex structure moduli in the local Calabi-Yau. Depending on\nthe noncompact flux, this potential can be very complicated and create nonsupersymmetric\nmetastable vacua in the local Calabi-Yau; the OOP mechanism [24] reviewed in 2.5.1 tells\nus exactly how this can be done. In this section, we will take specific examples of local\nCalabi-Yau and demonstrate that one can generate such OOP vacua as IIB flux geometries.\nIn subsection 3.1, we review constructions of typical local Calabi-Yau geometries, taking\nSeiberg-Witten and Dijkgraaf-Vafa geometries as examples. The focus will be on the form\nof the potential for the moduli which is induced by flux at infinity. We also make remarks\non the gauge theory interpretation of the physics of these geometries. In subsection 3.2, we\nproceed to an explicit construction of metastable flux vacua in a Dijkgraaf-Vafa geometry, by\ntuning superpotential appropriately. In subsection 3.3, we estimate how much control of flux\nat infinity is required to create OOP vacua.\n\n3.1\n\nLocal Calabi-Yau Based on Riemann Surface\n\nA large group of examples of noncompact Calabi-Yau manifold in IIB is defined by an equation\nof the form\nuv \u2212 F (x, y) = 0,\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere x, y can both be variables in C or C\u2217 . Compactifying on such a Calabi-Yau leaves\nN = 2 supersymmetry unbroken in four dimensions. Important roles in these Calabi-Yau's\n\nare played by the underlying one-dimensional complex curve in the x, y-plane defined by\nF (x, y) = 0 [25, 45]. In most of our examples this curve is smooth, and we will refer to it as\nthe Riemann surface \u03a3. The total Calabi-Yau space will be named M\u03a3 . The holomorphic\n3-form of M\u03a3 is given, e.g. for x, y \u2208 C, by\n\u03a9=\n\ndu\ndu \u2227 dx \u2227 dy\n=\n\u2227 dx \u2227 dy.\n\u2202f /\u2202v\nu\n\n(3.2)\n\nNotice that the total threefold can be described as a local (or decompactified) elliptic\nfibration over the x, y-plane. Over generic points in the base x, y-space, its fiber is described\nby a hyperboloid satisfying the equation uv = \u03bc where \u03bc is nonzero, which may be viewed\n16\n\n\fas a decompactified compact torus, making its B-cycle very large. On the other hand, when\n(x, y) \u2208 \u03a3, the noncompact fiber degenerates into a cone uv = 0, which one obtains by\ndecompactifying a pinched torus, corresponding to an A0 geometry.\nMany important properties of the noncompact Calabi-Yau threefold M\u03a3 have an interpretation in terms of the underlying Riemann surface \u03a3. For example, the compact 3-cycles\n{Ai , Bj } in M\u03a3 are lifts of compact 1-cycles on \u03a3, which we denote by {Ai , Bj }. If (x, y) \u2208 C2 ,\nthese 3-cycles may be constructed by filling in a disk D in C2 whose boundary \u2202D is the 1cycle on \u03a3. Now consider an S 1 -fibration over D where S 1 is the compact circle in the uv-fiber.\nSince this circle shrinks over \u03a3, the total 3-cycle has the topology of an S 3 . If one of the\nvariables x or y is C\u2217 -valued, the disk D will be punctured. In such a situation differences\nof 1-cycles have to be considered. We will see an example of this shortly. Notice that the\none-to-one correspondence between 3- and 1-cycles shows an equivalence between the complex\nstructure moduli on M\u03a3 and \u03a3.\nA basis of (2,1)-forms with compact support on M\u03a3 is given by derivatives of \u03a9 with\n\nrespect to the normalizable complex structure moduli: {\u03a9i = \u2202i \u03a9}. If M\u03a3 were compact,\nthese derivatives \u2202i would be K\u00e4hler covariant derivatives Di on the moduli space. Being\n\nnoncompact instead, the moduli space is described by rigid special geometry and, as we saw\nbefore, the covariant derivatives simplify into partial derivatives. Another reduction over the\ncompact 3-cycles in the Calabi-Yau shows that all these compactly supported (2, 1)-forms \u03a9i\nreduce to a basis of holomorphic 1-forms \u03c9i on \u03a3. Similarly, (1, 2)-forms \u2202i \u03a9 in M\u03a3 reduce\nto antiholomorphic forms \u03c9 i on \u03a3. \u03c9i satisfy the following relations, which are reductions of\n(2.24):\n1\n2\u03c0i\n\nZ\n\n\u03c9j =\nAi\n\n1\n2\u03c0i\n\n\u03b4ji ,\n\nZ\n\n\u03c9j = \u03c4ij .\n\n(3.3)\n\nBi\n\nThe relation between the 3-cycles/3-forms on M\u03a3 and the 1-cycles/1-forms on \u03a3 through\n\nthe trivial uv-fibration being understood, we can rewrite the various relations in section 2 in\nterms of the Riemann surface \u03a3. First of all, the holomorphic 3-form \u03a9 of M\u03a3 , which is given\n\ne.g. for x, y \u2208 C by (3.2), is easily seen to reduce to a meromorphic 1-form \u03bb = y dx on the\nRiemann surface in this case [25, 45]. The special coordinates (2.1) parametrizing complex\nstructure moduli are\n1\nX =\n2\u03c0i\ni\n\nZ\n\n1\nFi =\n2\u03c0i\n\n\u03bb,\nAi\n\nZ\n\n\u03bb,\n\n(3.4)\n\nBi\n\nand the K\u00e4hler potential (2.8) is given by\nK=i\n\nZ\n\n\u03a3\n\n17\n\n\u03bb \u2227 \u03bb.\n\n(3.5)\n\n\fRecall that, in the special coordinates {X i }, the moduli space metric takes a particularly\nsimple form:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u22022K\n2\nds =\n(3.6)\ndX i dX j = (Im \u03c4 )ij dX i dX j ,\n\u2202X i \u2202X j\nas can be shown using \u2202i \u03bb = \u03c9i and the Riemann bilinear relation.\nNow we want to consider a very small deformation of the system breaking supersymmetry\nto N = 1, thus generating a potential V for the moduli. As we saw before, this can be\naccomplished by turning on 3-form flux G3 with support at infinity in the local Calabi-Yau.\nThis flux an be thought of as leaking from the other part of the full compact Calabi-Yau,\nwhich has been frozen in the decoupling limit. We assume that the decoupling limit was taken\nconsistently with the elliptic fibration structure; namely, we assume that the noncompact flux\nis supported at the asymptotic infinities of \u03a3, while being compact in the direction of the\nuv-fibers.\nThe basis of (2,1)-forms with noncompact support, {\u039em }, in the Calabi-Yau M\u03a3 descend\nto meromorphic 1-forms {\u03bem } on the Riemann surface \u03a3, satisfying the relations\nZ\nZ\n\u03bem = 0,\n\u03bem = Kim ,\n(3.7)\nAi\n\nBi\n\nwhich are reductions of (2.24). Therefore, the 3-form flux with noncompact support, G3 , on\nM\u03a3 as given in (2.25) descends to a harmonic 1-form flux\ng = gH + gA ,\ngH = T m \u03bem + hi \u03c9i ,\n\ng A = l i \u03c9i ,\n\n(3.8)\n\nwhich will have poles at the punctures (or asymptotic legs) of \u03a3. A 3-form flux G3 in M\u03a3\n\ninduces superpotential (2.3), which reduces to an integral on \u03a3:\nZ\nW =\ng \u2227 \u03bb,\n\n(3.9)\n\n\u03a3\n\nwhile the associated scalar potential (2.18) reduces to an integral on \u03a3:\nZ\nV =\ngA \u2227 gA .\n\n(3.10)\n\n\u03a3\n\nIf we require the condition (2.26) that the flux (3.8) is zero through compact 3-cycles of\nMSW , which translates into\n\nZ\n\nAi\n\ng=\n\nZ\n\nBi\n\n18\n\ng = 0,\n\n(3.11)\n\n\fthen by the exactly same argument we did for general Calabi-Yau's in the previous section\nnow reduced to the Riemann surface \u03a3 (or simply by borrowing the result (2.30)), we can\nrewrite (3.10) in terms of periods on \u03a3:\n1\nV = (Kim T m )\n4\n\n\u0012\n\n1\nIm \u03c4\n\n\u0013ij\n\nKjn T n .\n\n(3.12)\n\nFor convenience, the relation between 3- and 1-forms in M\u03a3 and \u03a3 is summarized in Table\n\n1.\n\nM\u03a3\n\n\u03a9 \u2208 H 3,0 (M\u03a3 )\n\nnoncompact flux\ninducing superpotential W\n2,1\nT m \u039em \u2208 H \u221e\n(M\u03a3 )\n\n\u03a3\n\n\u03bb \u2208 H 1,0 (\u03a3)\n\n1,0\nT m \u03be m \u2208 H\u221e\n(\u03a3)\n\nspecial forms\n\ncompact flux\nentering potential V\n1,2\ni\nG\u2212\n3 = l \u03a9i \u2208 Hcpct (M\u03a3 )\n0,1\ngA = li \u03c9i \u2208 Hcpct\n(\u03a3)\n\nTable 1: The summary of the relation between 3-forms15 in Calabi-Yau M\u03a3 and\n1-forms on Riemann surface \u03a3\n\nNow we will turn to more specific examples of local Calabi-Yau geometries based on\nRiemann surfaces which have been studied in the context of string theory.\n3.1.1\n\nSeiberg-Witten Geometries\n\nAn illustrative example of the general Calabi-Yau's (3.1) is given by SU(N) Seiberg-Witten\n(SW) geometries. In type IIB, these correspond to compactifications on noncompact CalabiYau threefold MSW defined by\nMSW :\n\nuv \u2212 FSW (x, y) = 0,\n\nx \u2208 C,\n\ny \u2208 C\u2217 ,\n\nwhere the underlying Riemann surface \u03a3SW is a hyperelliptic curve\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nN\n\u2212 PN (x) = 0\ny+\n\u03a3SW :\nFSW (x, y) \u2261 \u039b\ny\n\n(3.13)\n\n(3.14)\n\nand PN (x) is a polynomial of degree N with the coefficient of xN \u22121 being zero:\nPN (x) =\n\nN\nY\ni=1\n\n(x \u2212 \u03b1i ),\n\n15\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03b1i = 0.\n\n(3.15)\n\ni=1\n\nAs explained in footnote 5, we do not mean here that \u039em 's span a complete basis of 3-forms in M\u03a3 with\nsupport at infinity; we are only considering a certain subset of all 3-forms diverging at infinity, which are the\nlifts of meromorphic 1-forms \u03bem on M.\n\n19\n\n\fThe coefficients of PN (x), or equivalently \u03b1i , are normalizable moduli, while \u039b is a fixed\nparameter. The holomorphic 3-form on MSW is \u03a9SW = du\n\u2227 dx \u2227 dy\nand reduces to [25]\nu\ny\n\u03bbSW = x\n\ndy\ny\n\n(3.16)\n\non the Riemann surface \u03a3SW .\nType IIB string theory compactified on the Calabi-Yau (3.13) without flux geometrically engineers [46, 25] an N = 2 Seiberg-Witten theory [35, 47]. In particular, the SU(N)\n\nSeiberg-Witten curve of gauge theory [48, 49] is geometrically identified with the curve (3.14)\nunderlying the Calabi-Yau. A T -duality along the compact circle in the uv-fiber, followed by\na lift to M-theory, translates [50] this geometry into a system of an M5-brane which wraps\nthe Riemann surface \u03a3SW and fills R3,1 . In the IIA limit, this system is related to a HananyWitten type brane configuration in type IIA, where one has two NS5-branes with N D4-branes\nstretching between them [51, 52]. From this last IIA/M-theory point of view, it is easy to see\nthe relation of the system to N = 2 SU(N) super Yang-Mills as the worldvolume theory on\n\nthe D4-branes. In particular, \u03b1i 's correspond to the eigenvalues of the adjoint scalar \u03a6 on\nthe Coulomb branch. In passing we also note that the geometries (3.13) are related to toric\ngeometries in IIA by mirror symmetry [26, 53].\nNow let us look at the homological structure of the Seiberg-Witten geometry (3.13), focusing on the relation between 1-cycles on the hyperelliptic curve \u03a3SW (3.14) and 3-cycles in\nthe Calabi-Yau MSW (3.13). The Riemann surface \u03a3SW may be compactified by adding two\npoints at infinity. If we represent the curve (3.14) as a two-sheeted x-plane branched over\n2N points, those infinities correspond to x = \u221e on the two sheets. It is thus a hyperelliptic\ncurve of genus N \u2212 1 with two punctures. Therefore, its first homology H1 (\u03a3SW ) is formed by\n\nN \u2212 1 pairs of compact A and B-cycles, (Ai , Bj ), i, j = 1, . . . , N \u2212 1, with in addition a closed\n1-cycle A\u221e around one of the punctures which is dual to an open 1-cycle B\u221e connecting the\ntwo points. How can these 1-cycles be lifted to 3-cycles in MSW ? The fact that y \u2208 C\u2217 means\n\nthat A-cycles on \u03a3SW are not contractible on the x, y-plane (recall that we are regarding \u03a3SW\nas embedded in the x, y-plane). Instead, compact A-cycles in the noncompact Calabi-Yau\n\nthreefold will reduce to differences of A-cycles on \u03a3SW . Indeed, notice that a point on the\n1-cycle Ai and one on another 1-cycle \u2212Aj , with opposite orientation, are connected by a P1\n\nin the Calabi-Yau. The resulting 3-cycle therefore has the topology of S 2 \u00d7 S 1 . For the Bcycles this subtlety does not arise, and compact B-cycles in the Calabi-Yau have S 3 topology\n\nand reduce to compact 1-cycles connecting the two hyperelliptic planes. See Figure 2. This\ndiscussion is equivalent to page 10 of [25], and in particular shows the equivalence between\n3-cycles on the Calabi-Yau's and 1-cycles on the Seiberg-Witten curve.\n20\n\n\fFigure 2: The relation between 3-cycles in the Calabi-Yau MSW and 1-cycles on\nthe Riemann surface \u03a3SW for the Seiberg-Witten geometry. For the A-cycle, by\nfibering S 1 over the line segment whose endpoints are at a point on Ai and a point\non \u2212Aj , one obtains S 2 . By moving the endpoints over Ai and \u2212Aj , one obtains\nS 2 \u00d7 S 1 . For the B-cycle, similarly moving the S 2 ending on Bi , one obtains S 3 .\nAs seen in section 3.1, the complex structure moduli space is conveniently parametrized\nby the special coordinates (3.4), which in the Seiberg-Witten case is conventionally denoted\nby ai , i = 1, . . . , N \u2212 1:16\nZ\nZ\n1\ndy\n1\ni\n\u03bbSW =\nx .\n(3.17)\na =\n2\u03c0i Ai\n2\u03c0i Ai y\nAs in (3.6), the moduli space metric takes the special form for these:\nds2 = (Im \u03c4ij ) dai daj .\n\n(3.18)\n\nUsing ai , the normalized basis of holomorphic 1-forms \u03c9i can be obtained as follows.

For\nCalabi-Yau, we should think of the Ai appearing in (3.17) e.g. as A\nei as Ai .\nsimplicity of presentation, we write A\n\n21\n\n\fwhere the total derivative term d\u03b7 is fixed by requiring that \u03c9i = O(x\u22122 )dx as x \u2192 \u221e.\nSpecifically, this leads to d\u03b7 = d(\u2212x log y) and \u03c9i is given by\n\u03c9i =\n\n\u2202\n\u2202PN (x)/\u2202ai\np\ndx.\n(\u2212\nlog\ny\ndx)\n=\n\u2212\n\u2202ai\nPN (x)2 \u2212 4\u039b2N\n\n(3.21)\n\nAlthough log y may appear problematic because it is not single-valued on the Riemann surface,\nits ai derivative is single-valued and does not cause any problem.\nAs we discussed in general in section 3.1, turning on noncompact flux breaks N = 2\nsupersymmetry to N = 1 by inducing a superpotential. In the present case where the Riemann\nsurface is hyperelliptic, we can take {\u03bem } and {\u03c9i } to be the specific ones given in Appendix\nA.1. As in (3.8), the 3-form flux in MSW reduces to a harmonic 1-form on \u03a3SW :\ng=\n\nX\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\nT m \u03bem +\n\nm\u22651\n\ni=1\n\nhi \u03c9i +\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\nl i \u03c9i .\n\n(3.22)\n\ni=1\n\nUnder the condition that the compact flux vanishes, (3.11), this leads to the scalar potential\n(3.12).\nWe can write the superpotential we are adding to the system in a form that will be useful\nlater.

By examining (3.12) and (3.18), one sees that the\nsuperpotential is given by:\nWSW =\n\nX\n\nT m um+1 ,\n\n(3.24)\n\nm\n\nwhere we defined\n1\num \u2261\n2\u03c0im\n\nI\n\nm\u22121\n\nx\n\n\u03bbSW\n\n\u221e\n\n1\n=\n2\u03c0im\n\nI\n\n\u221e\n\nxm\n\ndy\n.\ny\n\n(3.25)\n\nSo far everything was about geometry. Now let us turn to the gauge theory interpretation\nof these. As we mentioned above, the local Calabi-Yau geometry (3.13) without flux realizes\nN = 2 Seiberg-Witten theory, with the hyperelliptic curve (3.14) identified with the N = 2\ncurve of gauge theory. The special coordinates ai defined in (3.17) correspond to the U(1)\nadjoint scalars in the IR and parametrize the Coulomb moduli space. The superpotential\n22\n\n\f(3.24) also has a simple gauge theory interpretation. To see it, we need the relation between\nthe vev of the adjoint scalar \u03a6 and the curve \u03a3SW , given by [54, 55]:\n\u001c\n\u001d\ndx\ndy\nPN\u2032 (x)\ntr\ndv.\n(3.26)\n=\n=p\nx\u2212\u03a6\ny\nPN (x)2 \u2212 4\u039b2N\n\nIn other words, um defined geometrically in (3.25) has an interpretation in gauge theory as\nfollows:\num =\n\n1\nhtr \u03a6m i.\nm\n\n(3.27)\n\nFrom this, one immediately sees that the superpotential (3.24) can be written as\nWSW =\n\nX Tm\ntr \u03a6m+1 = tr[W (\u03a6)],\nm+1\nm\n\n(3.28)\n\nX Tm\nxm+1 .\nm+1\nm\n\n(3.29)\n\nwhere we defined\nW (x) =\n\nIn (3.28), \u03a6 is understood as the chiral superfield whose lowest component is the adjoint\nscalar.\nTherefore, the N = 2 gauge theory perturbed by the single-trace superpotential (3.28)\ncorresponds to the geometry (3.13) with the flux g obeying the following asymptotic boundary\ncondition:\ng\u223c\n\nX\n\nmT m xm\u22121 dx = W \u2032\u2032 (x)dx,\n\n(3.30)\n\nm\n\nwhere we used (A.11). Note that this equivalence holds for any configurations, supersymmetric or nonsupersymmetric, because we have shown the equality of the full off-shell scalar\npotential. The perturbed N = 2 theory is precisely the system which was shown in [24, 37]\nto have nonsupersymmetric metastable vacua if the superpotential is chosen appropriately.17\nTherefore, it tautologically follows that the IIB Seiberg-Witten geometry with flux at infinity\nalso has metastable vacua, if we tune the parameters T m appropriately.\nAs we mentioned above, this IIB Seiberg-Witten geometry is dual to a IIA brane configuration of NS5-branes and D4-branes which can be lifted to an M5-brane configuration.\nIn [56], it was shown that superpotential perturbation corresponds in the M-theory setup to\n17\n\nIt was shown in [24] to be possible to create metastable vacua by a single-trace superpotential of the form\n(3.28) at any point in the Coulomb moduli space for SU (2) and at least at the origin of the moduli space for\nSU (N ).\n\n23\n\n\f\"curving\" the N = 2 configuration of the M5-brane at infinity in a way specified by the superpotential. The metastable gauge theory configuration of [24, 37] was realized as a metastable\nM5-brane configuration and its local stability was given a geometrical interpretation. The\nabove proof of (3.28) is exactly in parallel to the one given in [56] for the M-theory system. In\npassing, it is also worth mentioning that the M-theory analysis of [56] revealed that at strong\ncoupling the nonsupersymmetric configuration \"backreacts\" on the boundary condition and\nit is no longer consistent to impose a holomorphic boundary condition specified by a holomorphic superpotential, which is in accord with [17]. Therefore, also in the IIB flux setting,\nit is expected that if we go beyond the approximation that the flux does not backreact on\nthe background metric, nonsupersymmetric flux configurations will backreact and it will be\nimpossible to impose a holomorphic boundary condition of the type (3.22).\nAlthough we do not do it in the present paper, from the viewpoint of flux compactification,\nit is a natural generalization to consider fluxes through the compact 3-cycles. Such flux will\nmake additional contribution to the superpotential of the form ei ai + mi Fi (see 2.5.1). On\nthe gauge theory side, in the Seiberg-Witten theory, this can be interpreted as perturbation\none adds at the far IR, but its UV interpretation is not clear [41].\n3.1.2\n\nDijkgraaf-Vafa (CIV-DV) Geometries\n\nAnother example of geometries of the type (3.1) is type IIB on\nMDV :\n\nuv \u2212 FDV (x, y) = 0,\n\nx, y \u2208 C,\n\n(3.31)\n\nwhere the underlying Riemann surface \u03a3DV is a hyperelliptic curve\n\u03a3DV :\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\nFDV (x, y) \u2261 w 2 \u2212 Pn (x)2 \u2212 fn\u22121 (x) = 0\n\n(3.32)\n\nand Pn (x) and fn\u22121 (x) are polynomials of degree n and n \u2212 1, respectively.

The Dijkgraaf-Vafa (DV) conjecture [63, 64, 65] was also based on the\nsame geometry. We will refer to this geometry as the CIV-DV geometry (3.31) or as the\nDijkgraaf-Vafa geometry henceforth.\nThe structure of the underlying hyperelliptic Riemann surface \u03a3DV (3.32) is similar to the\nSeiberg-Witten case (3.14); \u03a3DV is a genus n \u2212 1 surface with two punctures at infinity. If we\n\nrepresent \u03a3DV as a two-sheeted x-plane branched over 2n points, those infinities correspond to\nx = \u221e on the two sheets. The coefficients of Pn (x), which are nonnormalizable, determine the\n\nposition of the n cuts on the x-plane, while the coefficients of fn\u22121 (x), which are normalizable,\nare related to the sizes of the cuts. The first homology H1 (\u03a3DV ) is spanned by n \u2212 1 pairs\nof compact A- and B-cycles (Ai , Bj ), i, j = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1 with in addition a closed cycle A\u221e\n\naround one of the infinities which is dual to the noncompact B-cycle B\u221e connecting two\ninfinities. Because x, y \u2208 C, compact A- and B-cycles on \u03a3DV are all contractible in the\n\nx, y-plane and hence all compact 1-cycles on \u03a3DV lifts to 3-cycles in MDV with S 3 topology.\nThe special coordinates (3.4) in this case is conventionally denoted by S i , \u03a0i :\nZ\nZ\n1\n1\ni\n\u03bbDV ,\n\u03a0i =\n\u03bbDV ,\n(3.35)\nS =\n2\u03c0i Ai\n2\u03c0i Bi\nfor which, as in (3.6), the moduli space metric takes the special form:\nds2 = (Im \u03c4ij ) dS i dS j .\n\n(3.36)\n\nJust as in (3.21), we can write the basis of holomorphic 1-forms \u03c9i using S i as:\n\u03c9i =\n\n\u2202\n\u2202fn\u22121 (x)/\u2202S i\np\ndx.\n(\u2212y\ndx)\n=\n\u2202S i\n2 Pn (x)2 \u2212 fn\u22121 (x)\n\n(3.37)\n\nAdding flux at infinity and breaking N = 2 supersymmetry to N = 1 go just as in the\nSeiberg-Witten case. The Riemann surface \u03a3DV is hyperelliptic and we take {\u03bem } and {\u03c9i }\nto be the ones given in Appendix A.1. Just like (3.8) and (3.22), the 3-form flux in MDV\nreduces to a harmonic 1-form on \u03a3DV :\ng=\n\nX\n\nm\u22651\n\nm\n\nT \u03bem +\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\ni=1\n\ni\n\nh \u03c9i +\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\nl i \u03c9i .\n\n(3.38)\n\ni=1\n\nUnder the condition that the compact flux vanishes (eq. (3.11)), the 1-form (3.38) leads to\nthe scalar potential (3.12) which, just as we derived (3.24), can be shown to correspond to\nthe following superpotential:\nX\nWDV =\nT m \u03a3m+1 ,\n(3.39)\nm\n\n25\n\n\fwhere we defined\n1\n\u03a3m \u2261\n2\u03c0im\n\nI\n\nm\u22121\n\nx\n\n\u03bbDV\n\n\u221e\n\n1\n=\n2\u03c0im\n\nI\n\nxm dy.\n\n(3.40)\n\n\u221e\n\nThe 1-form \u03bbDV depends on the complex structure moduli S i of the Riemann surface (3.32).\nTherefore, by changing the parameters T m , we can generate a superpotential which is a quite\ngeneral function of S i 's. The OOP mechanism [24] states that, if one tunes superpotential\nappropriately, one can create a metastable vacuum at any point of the N = 2 moduli space.\nTherefore, also for this Dijkgraaf-Vafa geometry, we expect to be able to create metastable\nvacua by appropriately tuning T m , i.e., flux at infinity. Indeed, in the next subsection we will\ndemonstrate the existence of metastable vacua in a simple example.\nWe have been focusing on the case where there is flux at infinity but there is no flux through\ncompact cycles. However, let us digress a little while and think about the case where there is\nflux through compact cycles but there is no flux at infinity. In this case, the IIB system has\na standard interpretation [57, 58, 63, 64, 65] as describing the IR dynamics of N = 2 SU(N)\ntheory19 broken to N = 1 by a superpotential W = tr[Wn (\u03a6)], Wn\u2032 (x) = Pn (x), with the\n\nmoduli S i identified with glueball fields. More precisely, if there are N i units of flux through\nP\nthe cycle Ai , where N = i N i , then the system corresponds to the supersymmetric ground\n\u0002Q\n\u0003\ni\nstate of SU(N) gauge theory broken to\nSU(N\n)\n\u00d7 U(1)n\u22121 . It is important to note that\ni\nthis equivalence between the Dijkgraaf-Vafa flux geometry and gauge theory is guaranteed\nto work only for holomorphic dynamics, or for the F -term. On the geometry side, one is\nconsidering the underlying geometry (3.31) determined by Pn (x) and small flux perturbation\non it. On the gauge theory side, this corresponds to the limit of large superpotential, where\none has no control of the D-term. Therefore, there is no a priori reason to expect that the\nD-term of the Dijkgraaf-Vafa geometry, which governs e.g. existence of nonsupersymmetric\n\nvacua, and that of gauge theory are the same, even qualitatively. After all, two systems are\ndifferent theories and it is only the holomorphic dynamics that is shared by the two.20\nDespite such subtlety, it is interesting to ask what is the gauge theory interpretation of\nadding flux at infinity, in addition to flux through compact cycles. It is known that the curve\n(3.32) is related to the vev in gauge theory as [63, 64, 65, 54, 66]:\n\u001d\n\u001c\np\nW2\n1\ndx\n=\ny\ndx\n=\ntr\nPn (x)2 \u2212 fn\u22121 (x) dx.\n\u2212\n32\u03c0 2\nx\u2212\u03a6\n19\n\n(3.41)\n\nThis is the case when we treat bn\u22121 as non-dynamical. If we regard this as dynamical, this system realizes\nU (N ) theory.\n20\nOf course, it is a logical possibility that even the D-terms of the two systems are identical, or closely\nrelated to each other.\n\n26\n\n\fwhere W 2 = W\u03b1 W \u03b1 and W\u03b1 is the gaugino field. Comparing this with (3.40), one finds that\nthe quantity \u03a3m defined geometrically in (3.40) has the following interpretation:\n\u03a3m =\n\n1\nhtr(W 2 \u03a6m\u22121 )i.\n2\n32\u03c0\n\n(3.42)\n\nTherefore the superpotential (3.39) can be written as\nWDV =\n\n1\n1 X m\nT tr[W 2 \u03a6m ] =\ntr[W 2 M(\u03a6)],\n2\n32\u03c0 m\n32\u03c0 2\n\n(3.43)\n\nwhere we defined\nM(x) =\n\nX\n\nT m xm .\n\n(3.44)\n\nm\n\nTherefore, flux at infinity of the following asymptotic form:\ng\u223c\n\nX\n\nmT m xm\u22121 dx = M \u2032 (x)dx,\n\n(3.45)\n\nm\n\ncorresponds in gauge theory to adding a novel superpotential of the form (3.43). Again, this\ncorrespondence must be taken with a grain of salt, since it holds only for holomorphic physics.\nNote also that flux through compact cycles will induce glueball superpotential [57] of the\nform \u03b1i S i + N i \u03a0i (S) added to (3.39). Because this part does not contain tunable parameters\nsuch as T m that can be made very small, it is difficult, if not possible, to use the OOP\nmechanism to produce metastable vacua in that case.\nNow let us come back to the main focus of the present paper, the case where there is no\nflux through compact cycles. In this case, we do not have an interpretation of the system\nP\nas such an SU(N) theory described above, simply because N = i N i = 0. Below, we take\nthe Dijkgraaf-Vafa geometry with flux at infinity and no flux through compact cycles as an\n\nexample, and see that we can generate metastable vacua by adjusting the parameters T m\nusing the OOP mechanism outlined in the previous section.\n\n3.2\n\nMetastable Flux Vacua in CIV-DV Geometries \u2013 An Example\n\nTo demonstrate that one can truly realize supersymmetry-breaking via the OOP mechanism\nin type IIB Dijkgraaf-Vafa flux geometries, we turn our attention now to a simple example,\nnamely the geometry relevant for SU(2)\nuv \u2212 FDV (x, y) = 0,\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\nwith FDV (x, y) = y 2 \u2212 P2 (x)2 \u2212 b1 x \u2212 b0 ,\n27\n\n(3.46)\n\n\fwhere we choose\n\n\u22062\n.\n(3.47)\n4\nFor simplicity, we will impose a Z2 symmetry on the Calabi-Yau under which x \u2194 \u2212x, the\neffect of which is to set the log-normalizable modulus b1 to zero\nP2 (x) = x2 \u2212\n\nb1 = 0.\n\n(3.48)\n\nAs usual, we can focus our attention on the associated Riemann surface, \u03a3DV , which in\nthis example has genus 1 and is determined by the equation\n\u0002\n\u0003\nFDV (x, y) = y 2 \u2212 P2 (x)2 \u2212 b0 = 0.\n(3.49)\n\nThis geometry admits a single dynamical modulus, b0 . This, in turn, can locally be traded for\nthe special coordinate S 1 which, for notational simplicity, we refer to as S in the remainder\nof this section\n\nI\n1\nx dy.\n(3.50)\nS\u2261S =\n2\u03c0i A1\nAlternatively, we can parametrize the moduli space by the globally well-defined coordinate\n\u03a32 (3.40), which we choose to denote simply by \u03a3\nI\n1\nx2 dy.\n(3.51)\n\u03a3 \u2261 \u03a32 =\n4\u03c0i x=\u221e\n1\n\nTo this geometry, we now consider turning on flux given by\nX\ng=\nT m \u03bem + h\u03c9 + l\u03c9,\n\n(3.52)\n\nm\u22651\n\nwhere \u03c9 is the unique holomorphic 1-form on \u03a3DV . As we have seen, this induces a nontrivial\npotential for \u03a3 of the form\n\u0013\u0012 \u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u0012 \u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202\u03a3\n1\n\u2202\u03a3\n\u2202WDV (\u03a3)\n\u2202WDV (\u03a3)\n,\n(3.53)\nV \u223c\n\u2202\u03a3\n\u2202S\nIm \u03c4\n\u2202S\n\u2202\u03a3\nwhere\nWDV (\u03a32 ) =\n\nX\n\nT m \u03a3m+1 (\u03a32 ).\n\n(3.54)\n\nm\n\nTo engineer a metastable vacuum at a fixed point, \u03a3(0) , we need only choose the T m so that\nWDV (\u03a3) is a cubic polynomial in \u03a3 obtained by truncating the expansion of a K\u00e4hler normal\ncoordinate associated to \u03a3(0) at cubic order. To determine the requisite T m , we proceed\nin two steps. First, we must determine the relation between \u03a3 and the higher \u03a3m (3.40).\nThis is rather trivial. Second, however, we must obtain an expression for the K\u00e4hler normal\ncoordinate associated to a generic point \u03a3(0) . This will be slightly messier.\n28\n\n\f3.2.1\n\nRelating \u03a3m and \u03a32\n\nEvaluating generic \u03a3m for \u03a3DV is relatively easy to do given the defining equation (3.49) and\nleads to the result\n\u03a32q\u22121 = 0,\n\u0001\n\u0012 2 \u00132(q\u2212n)+1 \u0012\n\u0013n\nq\nX\n\u0393 2q \u2212 n + 21\n\u2206\n\u22064\n\u221a\n\u03a34q =\nb0 \u2212\n,\n2\n\u03c0\n(2q\n\u2212\n2n\n+\n1)!\nn!\n2\n16\nn=0\n\u0001#\n\u0012\n\u0013q \"\n\u0393 q + 21\n\u22062\n1\n\u221a\nb0 \u2212\n\u03a34q\u22122 =\n2q \u2212 1\n16\nq! \u03c0\n\u0001 \u0012 \u00132(q\u2212n) \u0012\n\u0013n\nq\u22121\nX\n\u0393 2q \u2212 n \u2212 12\n\u22062\n\u22064\n\u221a\nb0 \u2212\n.\n+\n2\n\u03c0\n(2q\n\u2212\n2n)!n!\n2\n16\nn=0\n\n(3.55)\n\nFrom this, we first see that \u03a3 is proportional to b0\n\u03a3=\n\nb0\n.\n2\n\n(3.56)\n\nMore importantly, however, we are also able to immediately read off the degree of each nonzero\n\u03a3m when viewed as a polynomial in \u03a3\n\u03a34q \u223c \u03a3q + O(\u03a3q\u22121 ),\n\n\u03a34q\u22122 \u223c \u03a3q + O(\u03a3q\u22121 ).\n\n(3.57)\n\nConsequently, the lowest m for which \u03a3m contains a term proportional to \u03a3q is m = 4q \u2212 2.\nThis means that to introduce terms of order \u03a33 into WDV (\u03a3), it will be necessary to include\n\u03a3m up to m = 10, leading to much more singular flux than one might have otherwise thought.\nThis is the first example of a general lesson we will have more to say about later, namely that\nwhen engineering OOP vacua, the requisite noncompactly supported flux can have a large\ndegree of divergence which, to the best of our knowledge, is not easy to determine by any\nsimple arguments.\nBecause one can introduce quadratic (cubic) terms using any \u03a3m with 6 \u2264 m \u2264 9 (10 \u2264\nm \u2264 13) there is some choice as to which T m we can turn on to achieve a particular desired\n\nWDV (\u03a3). For the purposes of our example, we will only turn on T 1 , T 5 , and T 9 , thereby\nadding terms proportional to\n\u03a32 \u2261 \u03a3,\n\u0001\n1\n\u03a3\u22064 + 8\u03a32 ,\n\u03a36 =\n16\n\u0001\n1\n\u22068 \u03a3 + 48\u22064 \u03a32 + 128\u03a33 .\n\u03a310 =\n256\n29\n\n(3.58)\n\n\f3.2.2\n\nK\u00e4hler Normal Coordinate for \u03a30\n\nWe now proceed to the second step, namely computing the first few terms of the K\u00e4hler\nnormal coordinate expansion about a generic point \u03a3(0)\n\u0001\n\u00012\n\u00013\nz = \u03a3 \u2212 \u03a3(0) + a2 \u03a3 \u2212 \u03a3(0) + a3 \u03a3 \u2212 \u03a3(0) + . . . ,\n\n(3.59)\n\nwhere we have implicitly defined the coefficients\n\nwith g\u03a3\u03a3\n\n1\na2 = \u0393\u03a3\n,\n2 \u03a3\u03a3\n\u0001\n1\na3 = g \u03a3\u03a3 \u2202\u03a3 g\u03a3\u03a3 \u0393\u03a3\n\u03a3\u03a3 ,\n6\nthe metric associated to the \u03a3 coordinate\n\n(3.60)\n\n2\n\ng\u03a3\u03a3\n\n\u2202S\nIm \u03c4,\n=\n\u2202\u03a3\n\n(3.61)\n\nand \u0393\u03a3\n\u03a3\u03a3 the associated nonvanishing Christoffel symbol. Computations of quantities such\nas \u2202S/\u2202\u03a3 in Dijkgraaf-Vafa geometries are often performed using a perturbative expansion\nabout the singular point S = 0. For engineering OOP type vacua, though, we need to consider\ninstead the neighborhood of a generic, nonsingular point \u03a30 away from S = 0. Fortunately,\nin the simple case of a genus 1 curve, we can actually obtain exact results without too much\nwork by taking advantage of the parametric description reviewed in Appendix B.

In this subsection, we analyze\n32\n\n\fthis issue.\nAs one can see from (2.34), (2.35), in order to create an OOP vacuum at a specific point\n(0)\nX in the moduli space, one must be able to adjust the coefficients in the superpotential up\nto cubic terms in \u2206X = X \u2212 X (0) . If the dimension of the moduli space is d, this means that\nwe generically need to tune\nd+\n\nd(d + 1) d(d + 1)(d + 2)\nd(d + 1)(d + 5)\n+\n\u2212d=\n\u2261 Cd\n2\n6\n6\n\n(3.76)\n\nparameters in the superpotential.21 The last term is subtracting the degrees of freedom to\nchoose the vector ki .\nIn the local Calabi-Yau geometries we have been considering, the superpotential is parametrized\nby the coefficients T m . For example, in the Dijkgraaf-Vafa geometry, the superpotential was\ngiven by (3.39):\nI\nX\n1\nm\nxm dy(S),\n(3.77)\nWDV (S) =\nT \u03a3m+1 (S),\n\u03a3m (S) =\n2\u03c0im\n\u221e\nm\u22651\nwhere we wrote the dependence of \u03a3m 's on the moduli S = {S i } explicitly. Therefore, if\n\n\u03a3m (S)'s are generic functions of S then, by tuning Cn\u22121 parameters22 T 2 , T 3 , . . . T Cn\u22121 +1 , one\ncan create a metastable vacuum at a generic point S = S (0) . More precisely, the OOP mechanism requires that, when we expand \u03a3m (S)'s around S (0) in \u2206S = S \u2212 S (0) , the coefficients\nof \u2206S, (\u2206S)2 , (\u2206S)3 terms are all independent and by taking linear combinations of \u03a3m (S)'s\nwe can obtain the superpotential (2.35).\nHowever, as we saw in the example above, the situation is not generic for small n and\nwe need a more detailed analysis about how high degrees one should go, which is done in\nAppendix C. The result (eq. (C.4)) is that, if we would like to make a critical point at a\ngeneric point in the moduli space, we have to tune on T m at least up to m = mmin , where23\nn = 2 : mmin = 10,\nn = 3 : mmin = 15,\nn3 n2 n\nn \u2265 4 : mmin =\n+\n+ + 3.\n6\n2\n3\n\n(3.78)\n\nThere is certain genericily assumption on the dependence of \u03a3m on the moduli (see Appendix\nC), and hence the actual degree m one must consider can be larger than the one given above.\n21\n\nFor having a metastable vacuum, the superpotential does not have to be exactly the same as the ones\ngiven in (2.35); if the coefficients are very close to the ones given in (2.34), (2.35), one still expect to have\nmetastable vacua. However, this does not generically affect the number of parameters we need to tune.\n22\nNote that the number of moduli is n \u2212 1 because we are treating bn\u22121 dynamical.\n23\nThis result is for the case where bn\u22121 is treated nondynamical. For the result in the case where bn\u22121 is\nregarded as a modulus, see Appendix C.\n\n33\n\n\fTherefore, in order to stabilize metastable vacua made of n cuts by the OOP superpotential, we have to consider \u03a3m 's up to rather high degree mmin given by (3.78) at least.\nBecause the degree m corresponds to the order of divergence of the flux at infinity (\u03bem ), the\nnoncompactly supported flux must diverge at infinity at the corresponding speed.\n\n4\n\nFactorization\n\n4.1\n\nThe Basic Idea\n\nIn the previous sections we described how we can generate a supersymmetry breaking potential\nfor the complex structure moduli of a local Calabi-Yau singularity by the introduction of 3form flux which has support at infinity. Allowing flux with noncompact support may lead\nto various conceptual difficulties, such as the divergence of the total energy density. To\nclarify these difficulties we would like to sketch how such a system can be interpreted as an\napproximation of a larger Calabi-Yau threefold with flux of compact support in a certain\nfactorization limit.\nMore precisely, we start with a Calabi-Yau with a subset of cycles pierced by usual 3-form\nflux of compact support. In another region of the manifold we have a second subset of cycles.\nThe flux from the first cycles will generate a potential for the complex structure moduli of\nthe second set. In the limit where the cycles are separated by a large distance, and where we\nzoom in towards the second set, the flux from the first subset will look as if it is coming from\n\"infinity\"24 . In this sense, the noncompact setup considered in the previous section can be\nconsidered as a small part of a larger Calabi-Yau with compactly supported flux.\nIn this section we would like to understand this embedding into a bigger Calabi-Yau in\nmore detail. Our goal is to see how the potential (2.30) arises starting from the standard\nGukov-Vafa-Witten superpotential for 3-form flux in the larger Calabi-Yau.\nFor simplicity we will work with a noncompact Calabi-Yau M,\nM:\n\nuv \u2212 F (x, y) = 0,\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhich is based on a Riemann surface \u03a3 given by F (x, y) = 0. As we explained before the\ncomplex parameters entering the defining equation of the Riemann surface correspond to\ncomplex structure moduli of the Calabi-Yau. Some of them are non-normalizable and can be\nconsidered as external parameters. We want to tune these parameters to approach the limit\nwhere the surface \u03a3 factorizes into two surfaces \u03a3L and \u03a3R connected by long tubes. This\nfactorization lifts to the entire Calabi-Yau M and divides it into two regions ML and MR\n24\n\nAs we will see in more detail later, we also have to scale the flux in an appropriate way.\n\n34\n\n\fthat are widely separated. We introduce 3-form flux G3 of compact support on the 3-cycles\nof MR . The superpotential and scalar potential are given by\nZ\nW = G3 \u2227 \u03a9\nand\nV = GIJ \u2202I W \u2202J W ,\n(4.2)\nwhere the indices I, J run over all complex structure moduli of the total threefold M. Using\n\nthe properties of the K\u00e4hler metric GIJ in the factorization limit we show that the part of the\npotential (4.2) which depends on the complex structure moduli of ML is of the form (2.30).\nFurthermore, we find an understanding of the effective value of the parameters T m .\n\n4.2\n\nGeometry of Factorization\n\nIn this subsection we study the degeneration of a Riemann surface \u03a3 into two components\n\u03a3L and \u03a3R , depicted in figure 4.25 In this factorization data of the full Riemann surface is\nexpressed in terms of the complex structure of the individual surfaces. It is well known that\nin the limit where the length of the tubes L = 1/\u01eb goes to infinity the period matrix of the\nfull surface becomes block diagonal\n\u0013\n\u0012 LL\n\u03c4\n0\n+ O (\u01eb) .\n(4.3)\n\u03c4=\n0 \u03c4 RR\nWhile the off-diagonal components \u03c4 LR go to zero in the factorization limit, their subleading\nbehavior is quite important in our analysis since it expresses the weak interaction between\nthe two sectors. The period matrix \u03c4 LR can be computed systematically in an expansion in\n\u01eb from data on each of the two surfaces as we explain below.\n\nFigure 4: Two conformally equivalent ways of viewing the factorization of a Riemann surface into two parts. Physically though, we should distinguish both points\nof view, since particle masses depend on the size of the cycles. Because in our\nsituation no new massless appears in the factorization limit, the left diagram represents our point of view best.\n\nTechnically, we describe the factorization of the Riemann surface with the plumbing fixture\nmethod [67]. So consider two Riemann surfaces \u03a3L and \u03a3R of genus gL and gR respectively.\n25\n\nIn general these components could be connected in a non-trivial way. We restrict our computations in\nthis section to the case in which they are linked by just one long tube. These should be easily extendible to\nmore general cases.\n\n35\n\n\fOn the left surface \u03a3L we have gL holomorphic differentials \u03c9i , while on the right surface\n\u03a3R similarly gR holomorphic differentials \u03c9i\u2032 . The complex structure of the left surface is\ndetermined by the periods of the holomorphic differentials\nZ\nZ\n1\n1\ni\n\u03c9j = \u03b4j ,\n\u03c9j = \u03c4ijLL ,\n(4.4)\n2\u03c0i Ai\n2\u03c0i Bi\nwhere \u03c4ijLL is the period matrix of \u03a3L , and we choose our definitions similarly for the right\nsurface.\nThe plumbing fixture method works after choosing a puncture P on \u03a3L and P \u2032 on \u03a3R .\nIt connects the two surfaces by a long tube of length L which is glued onto neighborhoods\nof the punctures P and P \u2032 . More precisely, we pick a local holomorphic coordinate z around\nthe puncture P such that z(P ) = 0 and a holomorphic coordinate z \u2032 near P \u2032 with z \u2032 (P \u2032 ) = 0.\nThen we identify points in these neighborhoods as\nzz \u2032 = \u01eb.\n\n(4.5)\n\nNow we want to compute the period matrix of the full Riemann surface in terms of complex\nstructure data of the two surfaces. For this we need to understand how the differentials \u03c9i and\n\u03c9i\u2032 extend to well-defined holomorphic differentials on the full surface \u03a3 = \u03a3L \u222a \u03a3R / \u223c, where\n\u223c is the above identification. Let us first consider how to lift the differential \u03c9i . Around the\npuncture P it may be expanded as\n\n\u03c9i =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nP m\u22121\nKim\nz\ndz,\n\n(4.6)\n\nm=1\nP\nwhere the functions Kim\nare given by (A.7). Once we write this in terms of z \u2032 we observe\n\nthat, as seen from the right surface, the differential has a Laurent expansion. So \u03c9i will be\nP\u2032\nof the right surface. A\nwritten as a linear combination of the meromorphic differentials \u03bem\nmeromorphic differential has the following expansion around the puncture\n!\n\u221e\nX\nm\nP\n(4.7)\nhP z n\u22121 dz.\n+\n\u03bem\n=\nz m+1 n=1 mn\nHere we have introduced the functions hPmn , which depend on the complex structure moduli\n\nof the surface and the position of P . So in general the differential \u03c9i will lift to a differential\n\u03c9ei on the full surface which can be written as\n\uf8f1\n\u221e\nX\n\uf8f4\nP\n\uf8f4\nxim \u03bem\non \u03a3L ,\n\u03c9\n+\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 i\nm=1\n\u03c9ei =\n(4.8)\n\u221e\nX\n\uf8f4\n\u2032\n\uf8f4\nP\n\uf8f4\nyim \u03bem\non \u03a3R .\n\uf8f3\nm=1\n\n36\n\n\ffor some coefficients xim and yim . Matching the differential on the two sides we find the\nfollowing conditions\n!\n\u221e\n\u221e\nm\nm X\nX\n\u01eb\n\u01eb\n\u2032\nP\nyin hPnm ,\nyim = \u2212\nKim\n+\nxin hPnm .\n(4.9)\nxim = \u2212\nm n=1\nm\nn=1\nThis allows us to compute the cross-period matrix as\nZ\n\u221e\n\u221e\nX\nX\n\u01ebn P \u22121 P \u2032\nP\u2032\nLR\nKj \u2032 m yim = \u2212\n\u03c4ij \u2032 =\n\u03c9i =\nK G K\u2032 ,\nn im mn j n\nbj \u2032\nm,n=1\nm=1\nGmn \u2261 \u03b4mn \u2212\n\n\u221e\nX\n\u01ebn+l\nl=1\n\nnl\n\n(4.10)\n\nh\u2032ml hln .\n\nFrom this equation we can read off all order \u01eb-corrections to the off-diagonal piece of the\nperiod matrix when a surface \u03a3 degenerates.\nAlso, this procedure gives a clear understanding of the term \"flux at infinity\". We see that\nthe flux at infinity is generated by regular forms on the degenerated surface, and therefore\nwill at most have finite order poles at the punctures.\nNotice that for a Calabi-Yau threefold that is based on a Riemann surface, the factorization\nregion is described by the deformed conifold geometry\nuv + x2 + y 2 = \u01eb,\n\nor equivalently uv + zz \u2032 = \u01eb.\n\n(4.11)\n\nUsually, this is described as a 3-sphere shrinking to zero-size when \u01eb \u2192 0. However, as for\n\nthe complex 1-dimensional plumbing fixture case we want the two sectors to be far apart\nfrom each other. Therefore we consider the conformally equivalent setup where the 3-sphere\nis scaled to be of finite size, while the transverse directions are made very large. The finite\nsize three-sphere reduces to the cross-section of the tube on the left in figure 4, whereas the\n\ntransverse directions reduce to the tube-length.\np\nTo describe the left and right neighborhoods of the degeneration, we can fix x = \u01eb \u2212 y 2 \u2212 uv\np\non the left and x = \u2212 \u01eb \u2212 y 2 \u2212 uv on the right. In the limit that \u01eb \u2192 0 these neighborhoods\n\nwill not just intersect in a point, but in the divisor uv + y 2 = 0. This is the region where\nregular forms on the total threefold will develop poles when the degeneration starts.\n\n4.3\n\nDynamics\n\nNow we consider turning on flux on the threefold. For simplicity we again take a Calabi-Yau\n(4.1) that is based on a factorized Riemann surface. We turn on 3-form flux G3 = F3 \u2212 \u03c4 H3\nwhich is only piercing the set of A-cycles corresponding to \u03a3R , as can be seen in figure 5,\n37\n\n\fand write down the corresponding (super) potential. For regularization issues later, we take\ntwo more punctures on the right surface labeled by \u00b1\u221e and turn on some flux \u03b1 through the\nnoncompact B\u221e cycle running from +\u221e to \u2212\u221e.\n\nFigure 5: Turning on flux on the right part of the factorized Calabi-Yau.\n\nA basis of A and B cycles is given by the compact 3-cycles on the left and the right,\ntogether with the lift A\u221e of the A-cycle enclosing +\u221e and B\u221e . So the flux is determined by\nZ\nZ\nZ\ni\u2032\nG3 = 0,\nG3 = N ,\nG3 = 0,\ni\ni\u2032\n\u221e\nA\nA\nA\nZ\nZ\nZ\n(4.12)\nG3 = \u03b1.\nG3 = 0,\nG3 = 0,\nBi\u2032\n\nBi\n\nB\u221e\n\nLet us denote the complex structure moduli and their duals by X I and FI , which are the\nAI resp. BI periods of the holomorphic 3-form \u03a9. Here we use the capital indices I = {i, i\u2032 , \u221e}\nto run over both the left and the right sides. Then the GVW superpotential for the complex\nstructure moduli is given by\nW =\n\nZ\n\nG3 \u2227 \u03a9 = \u03b1X \u221e +\n\nX\n\n\u2032\n\nN i FiR\u2032 ,\n\n(4.13)\n\ni\u2032\n\nand the corresponding scalar potential by\nV =\n\nX\n\nGIJ \u2202I W \u2202J W .\n\n(4.14)\n\nI,J\n\nSince X \u221e corresponds to a log-normalizable period and the derivatives in the above potential\njust correspond to normalizable modes, the \u03b1-factor decouples. This shows that\n#\n\"\n\u0011 \u0012 1 \u0013ij\n\u0011 \u0012 1 \u0013ij \u2032\n\u0010 \u2032\nX \u0010 \u2032\nX\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2032\n\u2032\nk LR\nk\nLR\nV =\nN \u03c4k\u2032 i\n+\nN l \u03c4lLR\nRe N \u03c4k\u2032 i\nN l \u03c4lRR\n\u2032j\n\u2032j\u2032\nIm\n\u03c4\nIm\n\u03c4\nLL\nLR\ni,j,k \u2032 ,l\u2032\ni,j \u2032 ,k \u2032 ,l\u2032\n\u0011 \u0012 1 \u0013 i\u2032 j \u2032\nX \u0010 \u2032\n\u0001\nk RR\n(4.15)\nN l\u2032 \u03c4lRR\n+\nN \u03c4k\u2032 i\u2032\n\u2032j\u2032 .\nIm \u03c4 RR\n\u2032 \u2032 \u2032 \u2032\ni ,j ,k ,l\n\n38\n\n\fThus the total potential is the sum of three terms, which we denote in the obvious way by\nV = V1 + V2 + V3 .\nNext we consider what happens in the limit where the distance L between the two sets of\n3-cycles gets very large. As explained before the period matrices \u03c4 LL and \u03c4 RR remain of order\none in this limit and become almost independent of the moduli XR and XL , respectively.\nOn the other hand, \u03c4 LR goes to zero which would make the first term V1 in the potential\n\u2032\nvanish in the limit that \u01eb \u2192 0, at least if we don't scale the fluxes N i appropriately. Since\nV1 describes the interaction between the two sides of the Calabi-Yau, we really want to scale\n\u2032\nthe fluxes N i to go to infinity in such a way that the term V1 remains finite.\n\nThen it becomes clear that the term V3 of the potential dominates over the other two\ncontribution to V . This implies that in the limit \u01eb \u2192 0 the term V3 should be minimized first,\ni.e.,\nX \u2032\n\u2200i\u2032 ,\n(4.16)\nN k \u03c4kRR\n\u2032 i\u2032 = 0,\nk\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nwhich is a set of nR equations for the nR moduli xj . The solutions of this system correspond\n\u2032\n\nto supersymmetric vacua for the 3-cycles on the right side. Once we have fixed all X j to\nb j \u2032 , we can consider the effect of the backreaction of the right\ntheir supersymmetric values X\n\nside to the left. This is purely expressed through the potential V1 , since the term V2 vanishes\nas well at the supersymmetric point.\nSo effectively the potential for the complex structure moduli XLi of the left surface is\n\u0011 \u0012 1 \u0013ij\nX \u0010 \u2032\n\u0001\nk LR\n.\n(4.17)\nN l\u2032 \u03c4lLR\nV1 =\nN \u03c4k\u2032 i\n\u2032j\nIm \u03c4 LL\n\u2032 \u2032\ni,j,k ,l\n\nP\n\nThis may be written as V1 = i,j \u2202i Weff (1/ Im \u03c4 )ij\nLL \u2202j Weff , where we define the effective \"superpotential\" for the left complex structure moduli as\nX \u2032\n\u2202i Weff \u2261\nN k \u03c4kLR\n(4.18)\n\u2032i .\nk\u2032\n\nComparing with expression (4.10) it is clear that the fluxes on the right should be scaled\nin such a way that the coefficients\nX \u2032\nN k Kk\u2032 \u2032 m\n(4.19)\nT m = \u01ebm\nk\u2032\n\nremain constant. In that situation the effective superpotential is\nX\n\u2202i Weff =\nT m Kim\nm\n\nto leading order in \u01eb, which is precisely of the form (2.30).\n39\n\n(4.20)\n\n\f4.4\n\nGenericity of Potential and Metastable Vacua\n\nLet us summarize what we have demonstrated so far. We started with a large Calabi-Yau\nthat consists of two parts ML and MR separated by a large distance, and turned on a large\n3-form flux on one of the sides, say MR . This flux generates a large potential for the complex\n\nstructure moduli of MR , which are therefore set to their supersymmetric minima. The flux\non MR is also weakly backreacting to the other side ML , inducing a small superpotential for\n\nthe complex structure moduli of ML . We computed this superpotential in equations (4.18)\nand (4.20) and found that it is of the form (2.30). The main point is that the side ML only\nknows about MR via the parameters T m given by (4.19).\nIn this section we discuss two questions. The first to which degree we can tune the\nparameters T m independently. And the second is whether these T m 's can be chosen to realize\n\nan OOP supersymmetry breaking superpotential.\n\u2032\nAs we can see from (4.19), the values of the parameters T m depend on the fluxes N l on\nthe cycles of MR and also on the value of the (generalized) period matrix Kl\u2032\u2032 m . The last\nb j \u2032 on the right side. For given\none depends on the choice of the supersymmetric vacuum X\n\u2032\n\nlarge fluxes N l there is a huge number of supersymmetric vacua, or solutions of (4.16), with\nb j \u2032 and consequently of K \u2032\u2032 . The density of such supersymmetric vacua\ndifferent values of X\nlm\nover the complex structure moduli space of MR has been studied before [68, 69, 6, 70, 71], and\n\nit is believed that the vacua become dense in the moduli space in the limit where the fluxes\nare very large.\n\nThe coefficients Kl\u2032\u2032 m are holomorphic functions over the complex structure moduli space\nof MR . So naively one would conclude that when the dimension of this moduli space is large\n\nenough, meaning that the number of 3-cycles in MR is large, we can always find supersymmetric points where the Kl\u2032\u2032 m 's have the desired values. However the functions Kl\u2032\u2032 m are not\n\"generic\" and there may be relations between them which affect the naive counting. We have\nnot analyzed this problem in detail but we think the following statement is true. Any number\nof the T m 's in the superpotential (4.20) can be tuned by considering a Calabi-Yau whose right\nside MR has a sufficiently large number of 3-cycles, and there will be some supersymmetric\nvacua with right values of Kl\u2032\u2032 m to reproduce the desired T m 's to good accuracy.\nThis claim is made more intuitive by the following physical interpretation of equation\n\u2032\n(4.19). Start by turning on fluxes N l on the cycles of MR , which is based on the Riemann\n\nsurface \u03a3R . When reduced on the Riemann surface the flux looks like the electric field\n\u2032\nproduced by a charge in two dimensions. The set of fluxes N l resembles a charge distribution\non the cycles of the Riemann surface. To compute the field produced by these charges in the\ndistant region of the other set of cycles \u03a3L , one has to consider a multipole expansion. Since\n40\n\n\fthe matrix Kl\u2032\u2032 m computes the mth multipole expansion of a charge distributed along the l\u2032 th\ncycle, the coefficients T m are exactly the multipole moments of the charge distribution. In\nthis formulation our first question reads whether we can arrange a charged distribution to\nhave the desired multipole moments given by the coefficients T m . We expect that the answer\nis positive.\nThe second question is more subtle. To realize a metastable nonsupersymmetric vacuum\nvia the OOP mechanism, one has to tune the superpotential in a way which is determined\nby properties of the K\u00e4hler metric at that point. As we saw in section 3.2 one has to tune\nthe coefficients of the effective superpotential only up to cubic order in an expansion around\nthe candidate metastable point. Since we have a very large number of parameters T m at\nour disposal it seems that generically we should be able to tune them to generate metastable\nvacua at most points on the moduli space. However we do not have a proof of this statement\nand it is possible that various relations between the period matrices and the K\u00e4hler metric\ninvalidate the naive counting26 .\n\n5\n\nFactorization II: An Example\n\nIn the previous section, we argued, based on the factorization of the Riemann surface and\nCalabi-Yau, that it is possible to embed the nonsupersymmetric metastable vacua we found\nin 3 in a \"larger\" Calabi-Yau, the idea being that the flux threading compact cycles on one\nside of the Calabi-Yau looks like flux coming from infinity from the viewpoint of the other side\nof the Calabi-Yau. In this section, we will discuss the Dijkgraaf-Vafa geometries of subsection\n3.1.2:\n\u03a3DV :\n\n2\n\n2\n\ny = Pn (x) \u2212 fn\u22121 (x),\n\nn\nY\nPn (x) =\n(x \u2212 \u03b1I ),\n\n(5.1)\n\nI=1\n\nas an example where our proposal can in principle be implemented, and make some steps\ntowards actually confirming our proposal.\n\n5.1\n\nFactorization Limit in Practice\n\nAs explained in 3.1.2, \u03b1I are non-normalizable parameters which represent the positions\nof the cuts on the x-plane, while the coefficients in fn\u22121 (x), or equivalently variables S I\n26\n\nThis question is similar to whether one can realize the OOP mechanism with a single trace superpotential\nfor the adjoint scalar in an SU (N ) gauge theory. In [24] it was demonstrated that for SU (2) a metastable\nvacuum can be generated anywhere on the moduli space by a single trace superpotential, and for SU (N ) at\nthe center of the moduli space. It was not fully analyzed whether this is possible in generality.\n\n41\n\n\fdefined in (3.35), are normalizable (or at least log-normalizable) and hence are dynamical\nvariables describing the size of those cuts. Therefore, in this Dijkgraaf-Vafa case (5.1), \u03b1I\nare the parameters we want to adjust in order to approach the factorization limit where \u03a3DV\ndegenerates into two subsectors.\nSo, what we should do is clear: we divide the n cuts into two parts as n = nL + nR , the\nones on the left indexed by i and on the right by i\u2032 , and send these two groups apart from\neach other by a large factor L = 1/\u01eb so that\n\u03b1i \u2212 \u03b1i\u2032 = O(L)\n\n(when L \u2192 \u221e).\n\n(5.2)\n\nIn the L \u2192 \u221e limit, the left and right sides will be very far apart and the factorization we\ndiscussed in the previous section must be achieved. For example, the period matrix of the\ntotal Riemann surface must diagonalize as in (4.3) up to 1/L correction.\nThere is one thing we should be careful about when taking the L \u2192 \u221e limit. If we try\n\nto separate the two sets of cuts by naively taking the typical difference between \u03b1i and \u03b1i\u2032 to\nbe of order L while keeping the size of the cuts fixed, then a simple estimate of the scaling\nof SiL , SiR\u2032 using (3.35) shows that the physical size of the 3-cycles in the Calabi-Yau blows\nup. What we want instead is to end up with two sets of 3-cycles of finite size, separated by\na large distance, so that we are left with nontrivial dynamics of SiL , SiR\u2032 . To achieve this we\nmust also scale the size of the cuts, as we send L \u2192 \u221e. Let xL and xR be local coordinates\nin the left and right sectors, respectively, and set\n\nwhere\n\n\u2032\n\nx\neL = Lr xL ,\n\nx\neR = Lr xR ,\n\n(5.3)\n\nr=\n\nr\u2032 =\n\n(5.4)\n\nnR\n,\nnL + 1\n\nnL\n.\nnR + 1\n\nThen, from (3.35), it is not difficult to see that we can keep SiL , SiR\u2032 finite if we keep x\neL , x\neR\n\nfinite while taking the L \u2192 \u221e limit. A similar rescaling of local coordinates must be also\nnecessary when taking a factorization limit in any other examples than (5.1).\n\n5.2\n\nComputation of Period Matrix\n\nIn the Dijkgraaf-Vafa geometry (5.1), the period matrix is given by\n\u03c4IJ =\n\n\u2202 2 F0\n,\n\u2202S I \u2202S J\n\n(5.5)\n\nHere, F0 is the B-model prepotential, which by the Dijkgraaf-Vafa relation [63, 72] is related\nto matrix models. The precise way to scale various quantities to take the factorization limit\n42\n\n\fbeing understood from subsection 5.1, it is in principle possible to confirm our proposal for the\nDijkgraaf-Vafa geometry using (5.5). For doing that, it is important to be able to compute the\nprepotential F0 for a large number of cuts n. The results from section 3 show that generating\n\na metastable vacuum requires quite a lot of coefficients T m . Since we roughly need the same\nnumber of cuts on the right as the number of tuned \u03a3m 's on the left, the total Riemann\n\nsurface must have quite a large number of cuts. So, in this subsection we will explain the way\nto compute F0 and thus \u03c4IJ for an arbitrary n.\n\nFor Dijkgraaf-Vafa geometries (5.1) the prepotential F0 may in fact be computed for any\nnumber of cuts n in a number of ways. The most direct way is evaluating the period integrals\non the hyperelliptic curve. This has been done up to cubic order in S I in [73]. Duality with\na U(N) matrix model [63, 72]\n\"\u221e\n# Z\n\u0015\n\u0014\nX\n1\n2g\u22122\nN2\ntr W (\u03a6) ,\n(5.6)\nZ = exp\ngs Fg (S) = d \u03a6 exp\ng\ns\ng=0\nwhere the matrix model action is given by\n\u2032\n\nW (x) = Pn (x) =\n\nn\nY\n\nI=1\n\n(x \u2212 \u03b1I )\n\n(5.7)\n\nmakes this computation quite a bit simpler. Let us quickly show this argument [72].\nThe field \u03a6 is an N \u00d7 N matrix. Say N I eigenvalues of \u03a6 are placed at the critical point\nP\nx = \u03b1I and divide the matrix \u03a6 into N I \u00d7 N J blocks \u03a6IJ , where nI=1 N I = N. One can go\n\nto the gauge \u03a6IJ = 0 for I 6= J by introducing fermionic ghosts in the matrix model action.\nThis produces the following extra term in the action, where \u03a6I \u2261 \u03a6II :\nWghost =\n\nX\n\ntr(BJI \u03a6I CIJ + CJI \u03a6I BIJ ).\n\n(5.8)\n\nI6=J\n\nTo write down Feynman diagrams, we expand \u03a6I around x = \u03b1I as \u03a6I = \u03b1I + \u03c6I . A\nTaylor series of W (\u03a6I ) = W (\u03b1I + \u03c6I ) around \u03b1I yields the propagator and p-vertices for \u03c6I .\nIn particular, this shows that the propagator for \u03c6I is given by\nh\u03c6I \u03c6I i =\nwhere \u2206I = W \u2032\u2032 (\u03b1I ) =\npropagator to be\n\nQn\n\nJ6=I\n\n1\n1\n=\n,\nW \u2032\u2032 (\u03b1I )\n\u2206I\n\n(5.9)\n\n\u03b1IJ . Moreover, expanding the ghost action determines the ghost\n\nhBJI CIJ i =\n43\n\n1\n,\n\u03b1IJ\n\n(5.10)\n\n\fFigure 6: The contribution to F0,3 given in terms of matrix diagrams. Gray double\nlines represent \u03c6I fields, while black-and-gray double lines represent BC ghosts.\n\nand gives the Yukawa interactions between \u03c6I , BJI and CIJ .\nThe contribution to the prepotential F0 of order three in the S I 's is given by planar\n\ndiagrams with three holes.

In\nparticular, we compute F0 up to S 5 terms.\n\n5.3\n\nScaling of Period Matrix\n\nThe method explained in subsection 5.2 allows one in principle to compute the period matrix\nto any order in S I for general Dijkgraaf-Vafa curves (5.1). Then the factorization limit can\n44\n\n\fbe achieved simply by taking the L \u2192 \u221e limit of the result and one can start looking for\nmetastable vacua. In this subsection, as a step towards it, let us pursue a more modest goal\nof seeing the factorized behavior of the period matrix, (4.3).\nThe form of the scaling can be elegantly derived for any possible contributing matrix model\n\u2032\ndiagram to F0 . First note that \u2206i scales as L2r as L \u2192 \u221e, and \u2206i\u2032 as L2r . All propagators\n\nwith indices from either side of the surface have an expansion in terms of \u03b1IJ 's and \u2206I 's, and\nthus a scaling in L which is easy to determine. The total scaling of a planar diagram with an\narbitrary number of these elements turns out to depend just on the number of ghost vertices\nthat connect the left side to the right side. It is given by\n1\nL(1+r)Nii\u2032 +(1+r\u2032 )Ni\u2032 i\n\n,\n\n(5.12)\n\nwhere Nii\u2032 is the number of ghost vertices with external ghost lines indexed by (i, i\u2032 ) and the\nexternal \u03c6-line by (i, i). Note that in deriving this we assumed the scaling (5.3) and thus\n\u2032\nSLi , SRi are of order one.\nThis shows that a diagram with only indices on the left (or on the right) will be of order 1\nin L. Since such diagrams contribute to the period matrix \u03c4ij (or \u03c4i\u2032 j \u2032 ), so this shows that the\nperiod matrix is of order 1 in L, with corrections in 1/L from diagrams that contain at least\ntwo loops indexed by i and j. On the other hand, the off-diagonal pieces of the period matrix\n\u03c4ii\u2032 and \u03c4i\u2032 i contain at least one ghost cross-vertex with indices i and i\u2032 . These parts will\ntherefore scale at least as 1/L. In particular, for large L the properties of the full Riemann\nsurface \u03a3 are determined by those of the two factors \u03a3L , \u03a3R , and the period matrix \u03c4IJ indeed\ndiagonalizes as in (4.3).\nHaving checked the diagonalization (4.3), the problem of actually finding an example of a\nmetastable vacuum then just amounts to solving equation (4.19) together with (4.16) using\nthe data from matrix model, for T m giving a metastable vacuum. Solving these equations is\n\u2032\n\nnontrivial, since the relation between the flux parameters N i on the right and the coefficients\nin the superpotential T m we want on the left are non-linear, although we expect that the\nsolutions do exist by the multipole argument we gave in section 4. We leave matrix model\ncomputations up to requisite orders as well as finding the actual metastable vacua by solving\nthose equations for the future work.\n\n6\n\nConclusion and Generalizations\n\nSummarizing, we found that turning on flux with support at infinity in local Calabi-Yau in\ntype IIB induces superpotential for the moduli in the local Calabi-Yau, thus breaking N = 2\n45\n\n\fof the Calabi-Yau compactification down to N = 2. Then we demonstrated that one can\ncreate metastable vacua by tuning the flux at infinity using the OOP mechanism, using a\nDijkgraaf-Vafa (CIV-DV) geometry as a primary example. The metastable vacua known to\nexist [24,37] in perturbed Seiberg-Witten theory can also be understood in terms of metastable\nflux configuration.\nFlux diverging at infinity may appear problematic, but in reality a local Calabi-Yau must\nbe regarded as a local approximation of a larger compact Calabi-Yau and the flux at infinity\nhas a natural interpretation there; there is flux floating around in the rest of the Calabi-Yau,\nwhich \"leaks\" into our local Calabi-Yau and just appear to be coming in from infinity. This,\nfurthermore, motivates a more natural setting to realize metastable flux vacua: in a part, say\non the right side, of the full Calabi-Yau M, there are some 3-cycles threaded by flux (and\npossibly O-planes to cancel net charge if M is compact) and on the left side there are some 3cycles without flux through them. If the distance between the left and right sectors is large, the\nfull Calabi-Yau M factorizes into an almost decoupled system of ML and MR , and the flux\n\nin MR appears to be flux at infinity from the viewpoint of ML and induces superpotential in\nML . By adjusting the number of fluxes in MR , we can tune the superpotential and generate\n\nmetastable vacua in ML . This is a very well controlled setting to analyze flux vacua, which\nmay shed light on the structure of the nonsupersymmetric landscape of string vacua. We\nalso made some steps toward actually embedding metastable vacua in a larger Calabi-Yau as\nsketched above in the case of Dijkgraaf-Vafa geometry by computing certain matrix model\namplitudes. Actually finding explicit vacua along that line is an interesting open problem.\nNote that we needed just two main ingredients to achieve this result. The OOP mechanism requires that the complex structure moduli space is special K\u00e4hler, and it is important\nthat a superpotential for flux is very much controllable by tuning the flux, such as the GukovVafa-Witten superpotential. This means that we can generalize the above story to any setting\nwhich fulfills these two requirements. Other possibilities therefore include M-theory and Ftheory on Calabi-Yau fourfolds [74,28]. Let us finish by saying a few words on these two setups.\nCompactifying M-theory on a Calabi-Yau fourfold M4 with fluxes yields a three-dimensional\nlow energy theory with 4 supercharges. The complex structure moduli of the Calabi-Yau are\npart of the chiral supermultiplets and are described by variations of the holomorphic (4, 0)form \u03a9. In the local limit where the fourfold becomes noncompact, the K\u00e4hler potential on\nthe moduli space is given by\nK=\n\nZ\n\nM4\n\n\u03a9 \u2227 \u03a9,\n\n(6.1)\n\nso that the metric on the moduli space is indeed special K\u00e4hler. Moreover, it is well-known\n46\n\n\fthat the complex moduli may be stabilized by turning on 4-form flux F4 , which introduces\nthe superpotential\nZ\nF4 \u2227 \u03a9.\n(6.2)\nW =\nM4\n\nThe condition for unbroken supersymmetry is W = dW = 0, so that F4 has to be a (2, 2)-form.\nStabilizing the K\u00e4hler moduli as well requires that the flux is primitive under the Lefschetz\ndecomposition (and in particular self-dual). Turning on primitive (2, 2) flux on some compact\n4-cycles, we can now follow an equivalent procedure as in IIB.\nM-theory compactified on M4 is equivalent to compactifying F-theory on M4 \u00d7 S 1 , at\nleast if M4 is an elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau. This leads to a four-dimensional space-time\nwith 4 supercharges. So again, the K\u00e4hler potential is given by (6.1), and the flux F4 is a\n\nprimitive (2, 2)-form. The relation with IIB consistently reduces F4 to a harmonic (2, 1)-flux\nG3 . The extra seven-branes that must be inserted in IIB when reducing over a singular T 2\ndo not contribute to the superpotential and thus don't play an important role here.\nIn particular, consider as an example the local Calabi-Yau fourfold\nu2 + v 2 + w 2 + F (x, y) = 0,\n\n(6.3)\n\nwhere all variables are C (or C\u2217 ) valued, and F (x, y) defines a smooth curve in the x, y-plane.\nIts holomorphic four-form is given by\n\u03a9=\n\ndu \u2227 dv\n\u2227 dx \u2227 dy.\nw\n\n(6.4)\n\nThe u, v, w\u2013fiber defines a two-sphere over each point in the x, y-plane, which shrinks to zerosize over the curve F (x, y) = 027 . Four-cycles can be constructed as an S 2 fibration over some\ndisk D ending on the curve and have the topology of a four-sphere (when x and y \u2208 C).\n\nNotice that the intersection lattice is symmetric now and not simply symplectic anymore, so\nthat the bilinear identity takes a more complicated form. However, like in the threefold case\nall relevant quantities reduce to the Riemann surface, and the analysis is similar as before.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank J. de Boer, R.

The middle cohomology group has\ndim H 1 (\u03a3g ) = 2g. The intersection form on H1 (\u03a3g , Z) is antisymmetric and by Poincar\u00e9\nduality unimodular, meaning that we can pick a basis of 1-cycles Ai , Bj with intersection:\nAi \u2229 Aj = 0,\n\nBi \u2229 Bj = 0,\n\nAi \u2229 Bj = \u03b4ji ,\n\ni, j = 1, . . . , g.\n\n(A.1)\n\nSuch a basis is unique up to a symplectic transformation in Sp(2g, Z).\n\u03a3g has a complex structure moduli space Mg with dim Mg = 3g \u2212 3, g \u2265 2.\nA 1-form \u03c9 on a Riemann surface is called a holomorphic differential if in a local coordinate\npatch it has the form:\n\u03c9 = f (z)dz,\n\nf (z) : holomorphic.\n\n(A.2)\n\nWe will also consider meromorphic differentials, for which we allow the function f (z) to have\npoles at certain points on the surface. Now we present a standard basis for holomorphic and\nmeromorphic differentials on a general Riemann surface:\nHolomorphic differentials28 \u03c9i : Once we pick a symplectic basis of one-cycles, there is a\ncanonical basis of holomorphic differentials \u03c9i , i = 1, .., g, with the following periods:\nI\nI\n1\n1\ni\n\u03c9j = \u03b4j ,\n\u03c9j = \u03c4ij .\n2\u03c0i Ai\n2\u03c0i Bi\n\n(A.3)\n\nThe (symmetric) matrix \u03c4ij is the period matrix of the surface, which depends on the complex\nstructure of \u03a3g .\nP\nMeromorphic differentials of the second kind,29 \u03bem\u22651\n: These are characterized by a\n\npoint P on the surface where the differential has a pole of order m + 1 with m \u2265 1.

For example, the curve appearing in the\nDijkgraaf-Vafa case, (3.32), can be written as:\ny 2 = Pn (x)2 \u2212 fn\u22121 (x),\n\nPn (x) =\n\nn\nY\n(x \u2212 \u03b1i ).\n\n(A.8)\n\ni=1\n\nThis curve can be regarded as a two-sheeted x-plane with n cuts and two punctures, the latter\ncorresponding to infinities on the two x-planes. Let us denote these points by \u221e and f\n\u221e.\nA basis of holomorphic differentials \u03c9i , i = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1 can be constructed by\n\u03c9i =\n\nQi (x)\nQi (x)\ndx,\ndx = p\ny\nPn (x)2 \u2212 fn\u22121 (x)\n\n(A.9)\n\nwhere Qi (x) is a polynomial of degree up to n \u2212 2 chosen so that (A.3) holds. Note that this\n\u03c9i goes as \u223c O(x\u22122 )dx as x \u2192 \u221e, f\n\u221e, which means that this is regular at x = \u221e, f\n\u221e.\n49\n\n\fIn the hyperelliptic case, it is convenient to take the meromorphic differentials of the\nsecond kind, \u03bem , as\n\u03bem =\n\nRm (x)\nRm (x)\ndx,\ndx = p\ny\nPn (x)2 \u2212 fn\u22121 (x)\n\nm \u2265 1.\n\n(A.10)\n\nHere, Rm (x) = mxm+n\u22121 + . . . is a polynomial and the coefficients of xm+n\u22122 , . . . , xn\u22121 are\nchosen so that\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03bem = \u00b1 mxm\u22121 + O(x\u22122 ) dx,\n\nx \u223c \u221e, f\n\u221e\n\n(A.11)\n\nis satisfied. This condition is similar to (A.4), but this \u03bem has poles at two points, x = \u221e, f\n\u221e,\nn\u22122\n0\ninstead of one. The coefficients of x , . . . , x are chosen so that (A.6) is satisfied.\nThe meromorphic differentials of the third kind, \u03be0 , can be defined likewise using a polynomial R0 (x) = xn\u22121 + . . . , where the coefficients are chosen so that\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\nR0 (x)\n\u22122\ndx = \u00b1\n+ O(x ) dx,\nx \u223c \u221e, f\n\u221e\n(A.12)\n\u03be0 =\ny\nx\n\nholds and (A.6) is satisfied.\nLet us derive a formula that will be useful in the main text.

In particular, we think\nof \u03a3DV as a copy of the standard fundamental domain with two marked points, a1 and a2 ,\ncorresponding to the points at infinity on the two sheets.

The basic building blocks that we use to construct x(z) and y(z) are Janik's\nfunctions Fi (z) [76]\n\u03c4 +1\n(B.2)\nFi (z) \u2261 ln \u03b8(z \u2212 ai \u2212 \u03c4\u0303 )\n\u03c4\u0303 =\n2\nand their derivatives\n\u0012 \u0013n\n\u2202\n(n)\nFi (z) \u2261\nFi (z)\n(B.3)\n\u2202z\n\nA detailed description of these functions, their properties, and several sample computations\ncan be found in Appendix C of [77]. For now, we simply note a few elementary facts. First,\n(n)\n\nwe point out that Fi (z) introduces a branch point at ai while Fi introduces a pole of order n.\nFor n \u2265 2 these functions are elliptic while for n = 0, 1 they have the following monodromies\nFi (z + 1) = Fi (z)\nFi (z + \u03c4 ) = Fi (z) + i\u03c0 \u2212 2\u03c0i(z \u2212 ai )\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\nFi (z + 1) = Fi (z)\nFi (z + \u03c4 ) = Fi (z) \u2212 2\u03c0i\n\n51\n\n(B.4)\n\n\fIt is also useful to record the relation between these functions and the Weierstrass \u03c3, \u03b6, and\n\u2118 functions\nF (z) = ln \u03c3(z) \u2212 \u03b71 z 2 + i\u03c0z + ln \u03b8\u2032 (\u03c4\u0303 )\n\nF (1) (z) = \u03b6(z) + i\u03c0 \u2212 2\u03b71 z\n\nF (2) (z) = \u2212\u2118(z) \u2212 2\u03b71\n\u0012 \u0013n\u22122\n\u2202\n(n)\nF (z) = \u2212\n\u2118(z)\n\u2202z\nwhere\n\n(B.5)\nn\u00bf2\n\n\u0012 \u0013\n1\n\u03b71 = \u03b6\n2\n\n(B.6)\n\nFinally, we also recall the differential equation satisfied by \u2118(z)\n\u00132\n\u0012\n\u2202\u2118(z)\n= 4\u2118(z)3 \u2212 g2 \u2118(z) \u2212 g3\n\u2202z\n\n(B.7)\n\nwhich can also be taken as an implicit definition of the Weierstrass elliptic invariants g2 and\ng3 .\n\nB.2\n\nThe Embedding Functions x(z) and y(z)\n(n)\n\nUsing the building block functions Fi (z), it is fairly easy to write down embedding functions\nx(z) and y(z) satisfying (B.1). Because x(z) should be locally one-to-one near the marked\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\npoints, we must construct it from functions with single poles, namely F1 and F2 . On the\nother hand, y(z) \u223c x(z)2 near the marked points so it must contain functions with double\n(2)\n\npoles, F1\n\nwhere\n\n(2)\n\nand F2 .

To apply the OOP mechanism and generate a metastable vacuum\n(0)\n(0)\nat a point bi = bi , it is needed that, when we expand \u03a3m (b)'s around a point in \u2206bi \u2261 bi \u2212bi ,\n\nthe coefficients of \u2206bi , \u2206bi \u2206bj , \u2206bi \u2206bj \u2206bk terms are all independent and by taking linear\ncombinations of \u03a3m (b)'s we can obtain the OOP superpotential (2.35).\n\nFor simplicity, let us first discuss the case where we treat bn\u22121 , which is log-normalizable,\nas a dynamical modulus.

If they are generic polynomials in b with high enough\ndegree, then the expansion of \u03a3m (b) around a generic point b(0) in \u2206b will have different\ncoefficients of \u2206b, (\u2206b)2 , (\u2206b)3 terms, for different values of m. If this were the case, then\nthe minimum number of \u03a3m 's we need to consider would be Cn in (C.1).\nHowever, for small m, \u03a3m (p) is not a generic polynomial in bi and we need to be careful.\nFrom (C.2), one can read off the following pattern of dependence of \u03a3m 's on bi 's:\n\u2022 \u03a3\u2212n , . . . , \u03a30 do not depend on bk 's, because the only contributions come from Pn\u2032 .\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2022 A term with just one bi (i = 0, . . . n \u2212 1) appears in Pn\u2032 (fn\u22121\n/Pn2 ) and fn\u22121\n/Pn .

(3.31), (3.32):\nuv \u2212 FDV (x, y) = 0,\n\u0002\n\u0003\nFDV (x, y) \u2261 w 2 \u2212 Pn (x)2 \u2212 fn\u22121 (x) ,\nn\nY\n\u2032\nPn (x) = W (x) = gn+1 (x \u2212 \u03b1i ),\n\n(D.1)\n(D.2)\n(D.3)\n\ni=1\n\nfor arbitrary number of cuts n. Moreover, we will present F0 for general n up to S 5 terms. In\n\nthe present paper, the prepotential is used in section 5 to evaluate the period matrix of the\nunderlying hyperelliptic Riemann surface. However, the content of this appendix is almost\nindependent of the main text and can be read separately.\n57\n\n\fThe prepotential is physically important, because by putting fluxes in the Dijkgraaf-Vafa\ngeometry one can realize supersymmetric N = 1 U(N) gauge theory, and its glueball superpotential which governs low energy dynamics can be computed from the prepotential [57, 58].\nFurthermore, by the Dijkgraaf-Vafa relation [63, 64, 65], the prepotential is related to unitary matrix models. The relation to matrix models was studied also using supergraphs [78]\nand Konishi anomaly [54]. The same prepotential also underlies the physics of metastable\nbrane-antibrane systems studied recently [9, 79, 77].\nThe first computation of the prepotential was performed in [57] for n = 2 (two cuts) up to\nS terms by directly evaluating period integrals, where S is the glueball. For small values of n,\n5\n\nthe computation of F0 up to several orders in S is relatively easy, but computations for general\nnumber of cuts n require more systematic approaches. One such approach is to evaluate period\nintegrals systematically; ref. [73] established a methodology, computing F0 for general n up\n\nto S 3 terms. Another approach is to use the relation to matrix models. One can evaluate the\nmatrix integrals directly [80] or by a more sophisticated diagrammatic technique [72]. This\nmatrix model approach turns out to be rather efficient in actual computations and indeed,\nin section D.1, we will compute F0 up to S 5 terms. Yet another approach is to use the\n\nrelation to the Whitham hierarchy [81]. For other work on computations of F0 for general n,\nsee [82, 83, 84].\nWe believe that the result of this appendix has various practical applications, including\nsearch for nonsupersymmetric vacua in N = 1 gauge theories.\n\nD.1\n\nMatrix Model\n\nBy the Dijkgraaf-Vafa relation [63, 64, 65], the prepotential F0 (S), S = (S 1 , . . . , S n ), of the\ngeometry (D.1) is related to the free energy of the associated U(N) matrix model,\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\n1\n\u2212Fmm (gs ,N )\nN2\nZ=e\n= d \u03a6 exp \u2212 tr W (\u03a6) ,\ngs\n\n(D.4)\n\nwhere \u03a6 is an N \u00d7 N matrix.31 This matrix integral is performed around the vacuum where\nN i eigenvalues of \u03a6 sit at \u03b1i . If we replace N i in Fmm (gs , N) by S i by the relation\ngs N i = S i ,\n\nthen the free energy organize itself into a genus ('t Hooft) expansion. Namely,\n\u0013 X\n\u0012\n\u221e\nS\n=\ngs2g\u22122 Fg (S).\nFmm gs ,\ngs\ng=0\n31\n\n(D.5)\n\n(D.6)\n\nHere, the\n\"N \" in Fmm (gs , N ) denotes (N 1 , . . . , N n ) collectively, not to be confused with the\nP argument\ni\nrank N = i N of the matrix \u03a6.\n\n58\n\n\fAs reviewed in section 5, one can evaluate the matrix integral (D.4) by perturbation theory\nusing diagrams [72], as far as the perturbative part of Fmm is concerned. However, this quickly\ngets out of hand, particularly because for general n one can have p-point interaction vertices\nwith arbitrarily large p, which makes the number of diagrams explode. Namely, if we expand\n\u03a6 around the critical point x = \u03b1i , each coefficient gi,p in the expansion\nn+1\n\nX gi,p\nm2\nW (\u03b1i + x) = W (\u03b1i ) + i x2 +\nxp\n2\np\np=3\n\n(D.7)\n\ngives a p-vertex interaction, and p can be arbitrarily large for general n. Here,\nm2i = W \u2032\u2032 (\u03b1i ),\n\ngi,p =\n\n1\nW (p) (\u03b1i )\n(p \u2212 1)!\n\n(D.8)\n\nand W (p) is the pth derivative.\nA more efficient method amenable to computer was proposed in [85, 86, 87], and here we\ngeneralize it to the case with an arbitrary number of cuts n. First note that the perturbative\npart of the matrix model free energy Fmm can be written as an expansion in the coupling\nconstant gs as:\nFmm,pert (gs , N) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\ngsk fk (N).\n\n(D.9)\n\nk=1\n\nHere, the order k amplitude fk (N) is a polynomial of degree k + 2 in N i 's, which in turn has\na genus expansion as follows:\nfk (N) =\n\nk+1\n[X\n2 ]\n\ng=0\n\n(k,g)\n\nAi1 ...ik\u22122g+2 N i1 * * * N ik\u22122g+2 ,\n\n(D.10)\n\n(k,g)\n\nwhere the coefficients Ai1 i2 ... are totally symmetric in i1 , i2 , . . . , and [x] is the integer part\n(k,g)\n\nof x. For a given finite k, the number of coefficients Ai1 i2 ... in fk (N) is of course finite.\nTherefore, if we compute fk (N) for some small values of {N i } by computer, we can determine\n(k,g)\nthe coefficients Ai1 i2 ... . Furthermore, there is symmetry under exchange of eigenvalues; for\n(k,g)\n\n(k,g)\n\nexample, if we know A1123 , we can obtain A2214 by the manipulation:\n(\u03b11 , m1 , g1,p ) \u2194 (\u03b12 , m2 , g2,p ),\n\n(\u03b13 , m3 , g3,p ) \u2192 (\u03b14 , m4 , g4,p ).\n\nThis symmetry significantly reduces the number of \"data points\" {N i }, for which we should\n\nevaluate the matrix integral in order to determine fk (N). In particular, this means that, if\none knows fk (N) for n = k + 2 cuts, then one can determine fk (N) for arbitrary number of\ncuts n by symmetry.\n59\n\n\fFor actually evaluating matrix integrals, it is convenient to go to the eigenvalue basis [88]:\n#\n\"\n\"N\n#\nZ\nN\nY\nX\n1\ne\u2212Fmm (g,N ) = dN \u03bb\n(\u03bba \u2212 \u03bbb )2 exp \u2212\nW (\u03bba ) ,\n(D.11)\ng\ns a=1\na<b\n\nwhere the Van der Monde determinant is from the change of variables [88]. We would like to\ncompute this perturbatively around the vacuum where N i of the eigenvalues \u03bba 's are equal\nto \u03b1i , where i = 1, . . . , n. So, let us divide \u03bba 's into n groups and expand around \u03b1i as:\n\u03bbia = \u03b1i + \u03bcia .\n\na = 1, . . . , N i .\n\ni = 1, . . . , n,\n\nThen the matrix integral (D.11) is, up to a multiplicative constant,\n\uf8f9\n\uf8f9\uf8ee\n\uf8ee\nZ\nNj\nNi Y\nn Y\nNi\nn Y\nY\nY\n(\u03bcia \u2212 \u03bcjb + \u03b1ij )2 \uf8fb\n(\u03bcia \u2212 \u03bcib )2 \uf8fb \uf8f0\ndN \u03bc \uf8f0\ni<j a=1 b=1\n\ni=1 a<b\n\n\uf8ee\n\ni\n\nn N\n1 XX\n\uf8f0\n\u00d7 exp \u2212\ngs i=1 a=1\n\nm2i\n2\n\n\u03bc2ia +\n\nn\nX\ngi,p\np=3\n\np\n\n(D.12)\n\n!\uf8f9\n\u03bcpia \uf8fb ,\n\n(D.13)\n\nwhere we used the expansion (D.7) and \u03b1ij \u2261 \u03b1i \u2212 \u03b1j . Given {N i }, we can evaluate this using\ncomputer by power expansion in gs which, following the procedure sketched above, allows us\nto determine fk (N) order by order.\n\nD.2\n\nResult\n\nBy setting \u2206i \u2261 m2i , the first order result (O(N 3 )) is\n\u0013\n2 \u0013\nX \u0012 gi,4\nX \u0012 2gi,3\n2gi,3\n2\n1\ni 3\nf1 (N) =\n\u2212\n(N ) +\n\u2212\n(N i )2 N j\n+\n2\n3\n2\n2\n2\n2\u2206\n3\u2206\n\u2206\n\u03b1\n\u2206\n\u03b1\n\u2206\n\u03b1\ni ij\nj ij\ni\ni\ni ij\ni\ni6=j\n!\nX\n1\n1\n1\n+\n+\nN iN j N k\n+4\n\u2206\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u2206\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u2206\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\ni ij ki\nj jk ij\nk ki jk\ni<j<k\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\nX gi,4\ngi,3\n\u2212\nN i,\n(D.14)\n+\n2\n3\n4\u2206i\n6\u2206i\ni\nThe coupling constants gi,p can be expressed in terms of \u03b1i using (D.8).
