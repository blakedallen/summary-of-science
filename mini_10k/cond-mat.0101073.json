We illustrate\nthe experimental feasibility of our proposal with estimates for Fe10 molecules.\n75.10.Jm,03.65.Sq,73.40.Gk,75.50.Xx\n\nMagnetic molecular clusters have been the subject of\nintense research in recent years, because they offer the\npossibility of observing macroscopic quantum phenomena [1]. Ring systems such as the antiferromagnetic\n(AF) ferric wheels, Fe6 and Fe10 [2\u20134], also allow one\nto study the transition from microscopic magnetism to\none-dimensional bulk magnetism. In ferromagnetic clusters such as Fe8 and Mn12 , incoherent tunneling of the\nS = 10 magnetic moment is observed directly in magnetization and susceptibility measurements [5,6]. The\nAF ferric wheels are candidates for the observation of\nmacroscopic quantum coherence (MQC) in the form of\ncoherent tunneling of the N\u00e9el vector [7]. Although quantum effects in antiferromagnets are expected to be more\npronounced than in ferromagnets [7,8], the detection of\nquantum behavior is experimentally more challenging .\nThe reason for this is that magnetization and susceptibility measurements probe only the total spin of the\nmolecule which, by symmetry, remains unaffected upon\ntunneling of the N\u00e9el vector n. At low temperatures, the\ndynamics of n is determined by two characteristic frequencies, the tunneling rate \u2206/~ and the electron spin\ndecoherence rate \u0393S . In Fe10 , \u2206 can be tuned from 0\nto 2K by varying the magnetic field [7]. Although the\ntunnel splitting \u2206 enters thermodynamic quantities such\nas magnetization and specific heat, no conclusive results\nrevealing the characteristic functional dependence \u2206(B)\nhave yet been obtained [9]. Measuring \u0393S is of central importance for the characterization of the quantum tunneling, since coherent quantum tunneling requires \u0393S . \u2206.\nAn estimate of \u0393S can be obtained from the typical energy scales of various interactions leading to decoherence.\nSpin-phonon interactions are frozen out at low T . Nuclear dipolar (0.1mK) and hyperfine (1mK) interactions\nare significantly smaller than interring electron spin dipolar interactions (some 10mK). These numbers indicate\nthat, in Fe10 , tunneling of n is coherent for a wide range\nof \u2206.\nMotivated by these numbers, in this paper we study\n\nthe quantum spin dynamics of the ferric wheel. We show\nthat the tunnel dynamics of n enters the correlation functions of a single electron spin. As indicated in [10] for a\nbulk AF system, a nuclear spin coupled to a single electron spin acts as a local spin probe. We show that in\nsmall AF rings in which n itself has additional coherent\ndynamics, the correlation functions of the nuclear spin\nexhibit signatures of the tunneling of n. In particular,\nwe discuss the coherent dynamics of one nuclear spin coupled to one of the electron spins of the ferric wheel and\nshow that both the tunnel splitting \u2206 and the electron\nspin decoherence rate can be obtained from NMR and\nESR spectra.\nThe ferric wheels Fe6 and Fe10 are well characterized [2,3,11,12]. The s = 5/2 Fe III ions are arranged\non a ring, with an AF nearest-neighbor exchange coupling J > 0 and a weak, easy-axis anisotropy directed\nalong the ring axis ez . The minimal Hamiltonian for the\nsystem is\nH0 = J\n\nN\nX\ni=1\n\nsi * si+1 + h *\n\nN\nX\ni=1\n\nsi \u2212 kz\n\nN\nX\n\ns2i,z ,\n\n(1)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere N = 10 or 6 and sN +1 \u2261 s1 , h = g\u03bcB B, with B\nthe external magnetic field and g = 2 the electron spin\ng-factor. For Fe10 , J = 15.56K and kz = 0.0088J. For\nFe6 , the values for J and kz vary appreciably depending\non the central alkali metal atom: for Na:Fe6 , J = 32.77K\nand kz = 0.0136J, whereas for Li:Fe6 , J = 20.83K and\nkz = 0.0053J [11,13].\nFor kz = 0, the eigenstates of H0 are\nP also eigenstates of the operator of total spin, S = N\ni=1 si , with\nES,Sx = (2J/N )S(S + 1) + hSx [2]. For kz \u226a 2J/(N s)2 ,\nthe anisotropy can be taken into account in perturbation theory in kz . The scenario changes drastically for\nkz & 2J/(N s)2 , when n (staggered magnetization) is\nlocalized along \u00b1ez . We label the states with n oriented along \u00b1ez by | \u2191i and | \u2193i. In a semiclassical\ndescription, the low-energy sector of the ferric wheel consists of two states, a ground state, |gi = (| \u2191i + | \u2193\n1\n\n\f\u221a\n\u221a\ni)/ 2, and a first excited state, |ei = (| \u2191i \u2212 | \u2193i)/ 2.\nThe static equilibrium properties of a system described\nby Eq. (1) are discussed in detail in Ref. [7]. With\nB k ex , i.e. in the plane of the ring, the system\nexhibits interesting spin dynamics: In the high field\nregime, hx \u226b ~\u03c90 , n is confined to the (y, z)-plane and\ntunneling takes place through the potential barrier of\nheight N kz s2 . Inpparticular, \u2206 = \u22060 | sin(\u03c0N\nhx /4J)|,\n\u221a\n\u2212S/~\nS/2\u03c0~\ne\n,\n\u03c9\n=\ns\n8Jk\n/~, and\nwith \u22060 =\n8~\u03c9\n0\nz\n0\np\nS/~ = N s 2kz /J, shows oscillatory behavior as a function of hx [7]. We restrict our considerations henceforth\nto the geometry B k ex . For Fe10 , \u22060 \u2243 2.18K is much\nlarger than in, e.g., Mn12 [14,15] or Fe8 .\nSpin susceptibilities. - We consider first the standard ac. spin susceptibility and ESR measurements,\nin which an infinitesimal magnetic\nprobing field couPN\ns\nof\nthe ferric wheel.\nples to the total spin S =\ni=1 i\nWe will show that these experimental techniques are\ninsufficient to detect coherent tunneling of n in a system described by H0 alone. In an effective-action description for the system (1) with Lagrangian density\nN\n[in \u00d7 \u1e45 \u2212 h + n(n * h)]. In\nLE [n] [7], we find S = 4J\nhigh magnetic fields hx \u226b ~\u03c90 , the spin susceptibilR \u03b2~\nity, \u03c7\u03b1\u03b1 (\u03c9) = 0 d\u03c4 hT\u03c4 \u015c\u03b1 (\u03c4 )\u015c\u03b1 iei\u03c9n \u03c4 |i\u03c9n \u2192\u03c9+i0 , with\n\u03b1 = x, y, z, \u03b2 = 1/kB T , and T\u03c4 the imaginary time ordering operator, may be evaluated using spin path integrals.\nFor \u03c9, kB T /~ \u226a \u03c90 , hx /~, up to corrections O(e\u2212S/~ ),\n\u03c7\u03b1\u03b1 (\u03c9) =\n\nN\nf\u03b1 ,\n4J\n\nprobes allow the observation of the N\u00e9el vector dynamics.\nNuclear spins which couple (predominantly) to a given si\nare ideal candidates for such probes, as we shall discuss\nnext.\nNuclear susceptibility. - NMR techniques have been\nwidely used to study molecular magnets [16,17]. In the\nfollowing we show that nuclear spins can also be used as\na local probe to detect coherent tunneling of n. For simplicity, we restrict our considerations to interactions of\nthe form H \u2032 = As1 * I, which includes both the hyperfine\ncontact interaction and the direction-independent part of\nthe magnetic dipolar interaction. For 57 Fe, the dominant\ncoupling to the electron spin is by a hyperfine contact\ninteraction, AFe s \u2243 3.3mK [18]. In contrast, the interaction of a 1 H nuclear spin with the electron\nspins is dipolar,\nP\nwith a direction-independent term i Ai si *I. For AF order, the sum yields an effective coupling\nAH sn * I, where,\nP\ni+1\nfor Fe10 , the coefficient AH =\n(\u22121)\nAi depends\ni\nstrongly on the site of the proton spin I. For many of the\ninequivalent sites, however, AH is of order 0.1mK [17].\nWith NFe and NH the numbers of NMR-active 57 Fe and\nproton nuclei, as long as NFe AFe + NH AH \u226a \u2206, the effect of the nuclear spins on the electron spin dynamics\nremains small. We define the decoherence rates \u0393I and\n\u0393S of the nuclear and electronic spins as the decay rates\nof hIy (t)Iy i and hnz (t)nz i, respectively. For time scales\nt < 1/\u0393S , the electron spin produces a coherently oscillating effective magnetic field with frequency \u2206/~ at the\nsite of the nucleus.\nIn order to show that this field affects the nuclear\nspin dynamics, we now consider a single, NMR-active\n57\nFe or 1 H nucleus (inset of Fig. 1). For kB T \u226a ~\u03c90 ,\nwe may restrict our considerations to the Hilbert space\nspanned by {|gi, |ei}. By using the decomposition si =\n(\u22121)i+1 sn + S/N of a single spin into staggered magnetization \u00b1sn, n2 = 1, and fluctuations S \u22a5 n around the\nN\u00e9el ordered state, we obtain H \u2032 = As1 * I \u2243 Asn * I.\nWe show now that, due to he|nz |gi 6= 0 , the tunneling dynamics of n can be obtained from the nuclear spin\ncorrelation functions hI\u03b1 (t)I\u03b1 i. With he|nz |gi = O(1),\nthe dominant term in H \u2032 is Asnz Iz , or in the pseudospin\nnotation introduced above,\n\n(2)\n\nwith fx = 1 \u2212 O(\u03c0 2 N \u2206/8J) and fy \u2243 fz \u2243 1. It is\nclear from eq. (2) that the susceptibilities \u03c7\u03b1\u03b1 (\u03c9) for the\nring (1) do not exhibit resonances at \u03c9 = \u00b1\u2206/~. The\nmain conclusion we draw from eq. (2) is that a uniform\nmagnetic field cannot drive transitions from |gi to |ei.\nStarting from the rigid rotor Hamiltonian of the ferric\nwheel [7], this result can also be shown to hold for an\narbitrary direction of B.\nWe consider next the correlation function of a single\nspin, hT\u03c4 \u015di,\u03b1 (\u03c4 )\u015di,\u03b1 i \u2243 s2 hT\u03c4 n\u03b1 (\u03c4 )n\u03b1 i, for hx \u226a 4Js,\nwith i = 1, . . . , N . In contrast to the correlations of\nS discussed above, hT\u03c4 \u015di,\u03b1 (\u03c4 )\u015di,\u03b1 i indeed exhibits signatures of coherent tunneling of n. To evaluate the\ncorrelation function, we use an effective two-state description for the ferric wheel and introduce a pseudospin\n~ \u03c3/2, with | \u2191i and | \u2193i being eigenstates of \u03c3z . The\ntunneling dynamics of the N\u00e9el vector n is then generated by the pseudo-Hamiltonian \u2212\u2206 \u03c3x /2. Because\nhT\u03c4 nz (\u03c4 )nz i \u2243 hT\u03c4 \u03c3z (\u03c4 )\u03c3z i in the low-energy sector, we\nobtain immediately\ncosh[(\u03b2 \u2212 2|\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 \u2032 |)\u2206/2]\n.\nhT\u03c4 \u015di,z (\u03c4 )\u015di,z (\u03c4 )i \u2243 s\ncosh[\u03b2\u2206/2]\n\u2032\n\n2\n\nH \u2032 \u2243 Asnz Iz \u2243 As\u03c3z Iz .\n\n(4)\n\nNMR experiments measure via power absorption the\nimaginary part of the nuclear spin susceptibility,\n\u03c7\u2032\u2032I,\u03b1\u03b1 (\u03c9), and by pulsed techniques the nuclear spin\ncorrelation functions hI\u03b1 (t)I\u03b1 i in the time domain [19].\nFrom expanding hI\u03b1 (t)I\u03b1 i in H \u2032 ,\n2 2\n\n(3)\n\nhI\u03b1 (t)I\u03b1 i \u2243 hI\u03b1 (t)I\u03b1 i0 \u2212 A s /~\n\n2\n\nZ\n\nt\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\ndt\n\n\u2032\n\nZ\n\n0\n\ndt\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u00d7h[Iz (t\u2032 ), I\u03b1 (t)][Iz (t\u2032\u2032 ), I\u03b1 ]i0 hnz (t\u2032 )nz (t )i0 ,\n\nAfter analytic continuation, the real-time correlation\nfunction exhibits the e\u00b1i\u2206t/~ time dependence characteristic of coherent tunneling. We conclude that local spin\n\nit is evident that the dynamics of n enters \u03c7\u2032\u2032I,\u03b1\u03b1 (\u03c9).\n2\n\n(5)\n\n\fjumps and \u2206(Bx = Bxc ) = 0. Note, however, that our\ntheory only applies to high magnetic fields, Bx > 7.7T\nfor Fe10 . Coherent tunneling of the N\u00e9el vector n requires\n\u2206 & \u0393S . From the estimates for the decoherence rate \u0393S\ngiven in the introduction we conclude that this condition\ncan be satisfied even for a large range of \u2206/\u22060 \u226a 1.\nWe consider first 57 Fe, with \u03b3I = 0.18\u03bcN [20].\nFor T \u2243 2K and Bx \u223c 10T, the relative intensity of the satellite peak at \u2206 = \u22060 = 2.18K, is\n(As/\u2206)2 tanh(\u03b2\u2206/2)/ tanh(\u03b2\u03b3I Bx /2) \u2243 0.007. This intensity, however, increases by a factor of 10 (100) for\n\u2206 = 0.1\u22060 (\u2206 = 0.01\u22060 ). For 1 H with \u03b3I = 5.59\u03bcN [20],\nand a typical value As \u2243 0.1mK, the relative peak intensity is 2.05 \u00d7 10\u22127 (\u2206 = \u22060 ), 2.25 \u00d7 10\u22126 (\u2206 = 0.1\u22060 ),\nand 2.25 \u00d7 10\u22125 (\u2206 = 0.01\u22060 ). However, the number\nof protons in the ring is much larger than that of NMRactive 57 Fe nuclei, 10 . NH /NFe . 100, depending on\nthe doping with 57 Fe. Taking into account that the sensitivity of proton NMR is larger than that of Fe NMR\nby a factor of 3 \u00d7 104 [20], 57 Fe and proton NMR appear to be similarly appropriate for detecting the coherent tunneling of n. The observation of the satellite\npeak in (7) is feasible, but still remains a challenging\nexperimental task. The experiment must be conducted\nwith single crystals of Fe10 (or a Fe6 system with sufficiently large kz > 2J/(N s)2 ) at high, tunable fields\n(10T) and low temperatures (2K). Moreover, because Bxc\ndepends sensitively on the relative orientation of B and\nthe easy axis [11,13], careful field sweeps are necessary\nto ensure that \u2206/\u22060 \u226a 1 is maintained [21]. Note that\nthe NMR experiment suggested here could be more easily\nrealized with nuclear spins exhibiting higher NMR sensitivity than 57 Fe.\nWe show now that, from NMR spectra, also an upper\nbound for \u0393S can be extracted. The NMR resonance\nlines are broadened by the decoherence of the nuclear\nspin, with width \u0393I at \u00b1\u03b3I Bx /~. The NMR resonances\nat \u03c9 = \u00b1\u2206/~ also involve correlation functions of n, see\n(5). Thus the decoherence of the electron spin, \u0393S , adds\nto the linewidth, and the width of the satellite peak, \u03b4,\nis bounded by \u0393I + \u0393S < \u03b4. Measurement of \u03b4 then provides an upper bound for \u0393S . Further, \u0393S \u2243 \u2206 marks the\ntransition from coherent to incoherent tunneling dynamics. Hence, if \u03b4 < \u2206 this would indicate unambigously\nthat quantum tunneling of n is coherent. Note that the\nmaximum peak height of a Lorentzian resonance line is\nO(1/\u03b4), so a large \u0393S (< \u2206) would make detection of the\nsatellite peak increasingly difficult.\nESR measurements in the presence of hyperfine interaction.\n- We show now that, in the presence\nof a hyperfine coupling H \u2032 , the electron spin susceptibility of the ring, \u03c7\u03b1\u03b1 (\u03c9), also exhibits the signature of a coherent tunneling of n. This results\nfrom the fact that integration over the initial and final nuclear spin configurations causes the matrix elements he|S|gi occurring in the spectral representation\n\nTo evaluate eq. (5), we diagonalize the Hamiltonian\nH =\u2212\n\n\u2206\n\u03c3x + \u03b3I Bx Ix + AsIz \u03c3z ,\n2\n\n(6)\n\nwith \u03b3I the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio, which describes\nthe ferric wheel in the low-energy sector with a single\nnuclear spin I coupled to s1 , eq. (4). We assume thermal equilibrium for both electron and nuclear spins. For\nFe10 in the high field regime, the results may be derived\nby expansion to leading order in As/\u2206 and \u03b3I Bx /\u2206, because \u22060 \u226b \u03b3I Bx , As, for both 57 Fe and 1 H nuclei, and\nBx \u2243 10T. For I = 1/2, \u03c7\u2032\u2032I,zz (\u03c9) displays the unperturbed emission and absorption peaks at \u03c9 \u2243 \u00b1\u03b3I Bx /~,\nalthough these are slightly shifted if the hyperfine term\nAS * I/N is taken into account. \u03c7\u2032\u2032I,xx (\u03c9), however, displays resonant absorption and emission of small intensity\nat \u03c9 = \u00b1(\u2206 \u00b1 \u03b3I Bx )/~. Finally,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b2\u03b3I Bx\n\u03c0h\n\u2032\u2032\ntanh\n\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03b3I Bx /~)\n(7)\n\u03c7I,yy (\u03c9) =\n4\n2\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u0013\n\u0012\ni\nAs\n\u03b2\u2206\n+\n\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u2206/~) \u2212 [\u03c9 \u2192 \u2212\u03c9]\ntanh\n\u2206\n2\nexhibits satellite resonances at the tunnel splitting \u2206 of\nthe electron spin system. Their physical origin is readily\nunderstood in terms of a classical vector model. For A =\n0, I(t) precesses around the static magnetic field B =\nBx ex . For A 6= 0, the coherent tunneling of n leads to an\nadditional ac hyperfine field As1 (t) \u2243 As cos(\u2206t/~)ez at\nthe site of the nucleus. In contrast to a static hyperfine\nfield which induces a change in precession frequency and\naxis, the rapidly oscillating hyperfine field in Fe10 leads\nonly to a small deviation \u03b4I(t) = O(As/\u2206) from the original precession. In particular, \u03b4Iy (t) \u221d (As/\u2206) sin(\u2206t/~)\nalso oscillates at frequency \u2206/~ and hence gives rise to\nthe second term in eq. (7).\nWe restricted the above analysis to the low-energy sector of the ferric wheel. To check this approximation, we\nhave performed exact numerical diagonalization (ED) on\na small AF ring with one nuclear spin of I = 1/2 coupled\nto one of the electron spins. For the small systems accessible by ED, in this case N = 4, s = 3/2, and kz = 0.2J,\nthe field range for which the theoretical framework is applicable becomes rather small: 2J \u226a hx \u226a 6J. However,\nthe numerical results (Fig. 1) for he|Iy |gi indicate that\nour analytical value |he|Iy |gi| = As/2\u2206 entering eq. (7)\nis a good approximation. For our parameters, the analytical value tends to overestimate he|Iy |gi by \u223c 30% which\nresults from the neglect of ny in eq. (4).\nWe turn next to a discussion of the experimental feasibility of measuring \u2206 by NMR. Because As/\u2206 \u226a 1, the\nintensity of the satellite peaks at \u03c9 = \u00b1\u2206/~ (7) is small\ncompared to that of the main peaks at \u03c9 = \u00b1\u03b3I Bx /~.\nHowever, this satellite peak intensity may be increased\nsignificantly by tuning Bx close to one of the critical values Bxc at which the magnetization of the ferric wheel\n3\n\n\fof \u03c7\u03b1\u03b1 (\u03c9) (eq. (2)) to become finite. In the high\nfield limit hx \u226b ~\u03c90 , the matrix elements become\n|he|Sy |gi| \u2243 (As/2hx )(\u22060 S/4N kz s2 )| cos(\u03c0N hx /4J)|\nand |he|Sz |gi| \u2243 As/2hx . For a small system (N = 4,\ns = 3/2), we have again confirmed the qualitative features of these results by ED. It follows that \u03c7\u2032\u2032\u03b1\u03b1 (\u03c9 \u223c\n\u2206/~) = \u03c0|he|S\u03b1 |gi|2 tanh(\u03b2\u2206/2)\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u2206/~) exhibits resonances at \u2206/~. A qualitative understanding of this\nresult may be obtained by noting that a nuclear spin\npolarized along B results in an effective magnetic field\nex A/2g\u03bcB acting only on s1 . In a classical description this hyperfine field causes S to acquire a component\nn As/2hx along n, and the coherent tunneling of n now\nalso results in an oscillation of the total spin S. Again,\nthe decoherence rate of these oscillations, and hence the\nlinewidth of the ESR resonance, is bounded by \u0393S . Note\nthat As/2hx = 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 for a single 57 Fe nucleus with\nBx = 10T, so the ESR signal is very weak in this case.\nHowever, our calculations apply to any impurity spin\nj, which interacts with a single electron spin only, H \u2032 =\nAs1 * j. In particular, for an electronic j, A is typically\n103 times larger than for a nuclear spin, and ESR techniques become a valuable tool for detecting the tunneling of n. One advantage of this technique is that it\nis no longer necessary to have \u2206/\u22060 \u226a 1 to obtain a\nlarge signal intensity, and thus the complete range of\ntunnel frequencies could be explored experimentally [22].\nOur calculations also apply to situations in which several impurity spins ji produce different net magnetic\nfields for the two sublattices of the AF ring. For illustration, we discuss two simple scenarios. We consider\nN/2 impurity spins ji (ji = 1/2) coupled to s1 , s3 , . . . ,\nPN/2\nH \u2032 = A i=1 j2i\u22121 * s2i\u22121 . For hx \u226b As, kB T , all ji align\nwith the magnetic field B. Since they all couple to one\nsublattice only, their net magnetic fields acting on si add\nup, |he|Sz |gi| \u2243 (N/2)As/2hx, leading to a (N/2)2 -fold\nenhancement of the ESR-signal of a single impurity. In\ncontrast, a single impurity j coupled to both s1 and s2 ,\nH \u2032 = Aj * (s1 + s2 ), results in the same net magnetic field\nacting on both sublattices, he|Sz |gi = 0.\nConclusions - We have shown that NMR and ESR\ntechniques can be used to measure both the tunnel splitting \u2206 and the decoherence rate \u0393S in the ferric wheel.\nFor Fe10 , we showed that our proposal is within experimental reach. Our considerations apply to any AF ring\nsystem described by H0 , eq. (1), with some impurity\nspin coupled to one of the electron spins. Hence, the\nproposed scheme may prove useful for a wide class of\nmolecular magnets.\nThis work was supported by the European Network\nMolNanoMag, grant number HPRN-CT-1999-00012, the\nBBW Bern, and the Swiss NSF.
