Field\neffect transistors, tunnel junctions and laser diodes are only a few examples of a hardly\nmanageable number of electronic devices in which interfaces are essential.[1] Electronic\ndevices realize their full potential when an external electric field is applied. The\napplication of an electric field to devices, being simultaneously subject to photon\nirradiation, is an interesting approach to study a rather broad spectrum of fundamental\nissues and practical device oriented questions. By using ultraviolet (UV) light, internal\nphoto current measurements were successfully applied to metal-oxide-semiconductor\n(MOS) structures under bias. This allowed the evaluation of the energetic and spatial\ndistribution of trapped charges in the oxide and the effective barrier height for\nexample.[2-5] Recently this technique was extended to MOS capacitors under low bias\nfields and to high-k dielectrics. [6,7] Kobayashi and coworkers investigated Pt/oxide/pInP (100) MIS Schottky diodes under an external applied bias potential whilst\nsimultaneously taking x-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS).[8] M. Ishii et al. developed a\ncapacitance X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) method to analyze site selective\nelectron trapping centers in Cu2O and GaO.[9] Hard x-ray diffraction has been applied to\nevaluate the structural changes in piezoelectric and ferroelectric materials under an\nelectric bias field, with charge-density variations due to the applied electric field being\ndetected.[10] Recently such studies have focused on the microscopic definition of\npolarization.[11] Janousch et al. employed X-ray near edge spectroscopy (XANES) to\ninvestigate the local environment of Cr in resistive switching elements using finger\nelectrodes.[12] The mechanism of field-effect doping in cuprate superconductors was\nstudied using soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy and an applied gate voltage.[13]\nMotivated by the fact, that soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (SXAS) is a unique tool\nto study the electronic structure in metals, semiconductors and insulators, we applied\nthis technique to investigate the buried ferroelectric-electrode interface of ferroelectric\n2\n\n\fcapacitors.[14-16] SXAS measures the transition probabilities between a core level and\nthe unoccupied electronic states of a material at an atomic site.[17,18] The total\nfluorescence yield (TFY) monitors bulk properties due to the large photon attenuation\nlength (100 nm \u2013200 nm), while the short mean free path of photoelectrons (< 3 nm)\ncoming from the sample surface makes the total electron yield (TEY) a surface sensitive\ntechnique.[17,19-21]\nThe Pt/PbZr0.3Ti0.7O3 (PZT)/Pt ferroelectric capacitors were deposited on\nplatinized Si/SiO2 substrates, which results in a whole layer stack (from substrate to top\nelectrode) of Si(600\u03bcm)/SiO2(450nm)/Ti(15nm)/Pt(150nm)/PZT(180nm)/Pt(50nm).\nChemical solution deposition was utilized to grow the PZT film[22] and the capacitor\nareas were 3.425 mm2. Fig. 1 (a) shows a ferroelectric hysteresis loop of such a device\nafter an annealing at 700\u00b0C for 3 min in oxygen. For the as fabricated capacitors (black\ncurve) the coercive fields +/- E c were determined to be +/-110 kV/cm (Vc = +/-2V). The\nremnant states were +/-Pr = 30 \u03bcC/cm2, which compares well with the literature (black\nloop 1 in Fig. 1(a).[22] Such ferroelectric capacitors were placed in the undulator beam\nline 8.0 at the Advanced Light Source of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.[23] About\n80% of the capacitor area was illuminated by the synchrotron beam. The top Pt layer\nacts as a semi-transparent electrode for the soft X-rays. For the SXAS experiments the\ntwo leads of a capacitor were connected to an external circuit, which is sketched in Fig.\n1 (b). The two ammeters connected to ground allowed the study of the current\ndistribution under soft X-ray radiation, whilst a typical TEY standard set-up uses only\nthe bottom ammeter to study the surface properties of the bare surface without a top\nelectrode.[17] During the entire experiment the capacitor was under short circuit\nboundary conditions. The capacitor was initially biased with a voltage pulse for\n1 sec, either of +4 V or \u20134 V, between the top electrode and the bottom electrode\n\n3\n\n\f(+4 V means positive 4 V poling on the top electrode and vice versa for a \u20134V pulse\nsetting) to obtain a mono domain state. While tuning the energy of incoming soft X-rays\nbetween 450 eV and 480 eV, the current in the top (Itop) and in the bottom (Ibot) leads\nwere simultaneously acquired by the ammeters. We observed four prominent peaks (see\nspectrum Ibot (\u2013Pr ) in Fig. 2) which are related to the crystal field splitting of Ti 4+ in an\noctahedral symmetry. The first two peaks (at 458 eV and 460 eV) belong to the 2p3/2 (t2g\nand eg) (L3 edge) and the third and fourth peak (464.35 eV and 466.7 eV) belong to the\n2p1/2 (t2g and eg) (L2 edge) transitions.[24,25]\nThe spectra shown in Fig. 2 (a), exhibit a number of interesting features. We\nobserved four different base line currents (a base line current is defined at the photon\nenergy of 450 eV). Obviously, these currents (Itop and Ibot) depend on the polarization\nstate (+Pr and -Pr). The current Ibot (Fig. 2(a) showed the sign of a standard TEY set-up,\ni.e. the SXAS exhibited peaks, independent on the ferroelectric capacitors polarization\nstate, whereas the Ti L3.2 edge absorption signal Itop exhibited dips for the +Pr and the -Pr\npolarization state (curves labeled by Itop (+/-Pr), Ibot (+/-Pr) in Fig. 2 (a)). Moreover \u0394Itop\n(we used the current of the t2g Ti L3 edge at 458 eV) in the +Pr state was roughly a\nfactor 2 smaller than \u0394Itop in the \u2013Pr state. In addition, the spectra in the \u2013Pr state trace\nthe well known peak sequence of the Ti L edge in PZT, [26, 27] while the spectra in the\n+Pr state exhibited a broadening of the Ti L3 eg peak and a line splitting of the Ti L2 eg\npeak at ~ 466 eV.\nA possible scenario could be the following: Photo electrons were excited by the\nsoft X-rays at the Pt (50 nm thick) top electrode surface. The electrons have sufficient\nkinetic energy to leave the top Pt film into vacuum (external photo electric effect) and\ntherefore the capacitor (the top Pt electrode) is positively charged (see Fig. 1 (b),\nprocess 1). Consequently, a neutralization current Ineut from ground to the capacitor is\ngenerated for compensation (see Fig. 1(b)). Ineut splits into contributions to Itop and Ibot.\n4\n\n\fFor the +Pr state for example, Itop = 19.8 nA (@450 eV), Ibot = 1.1 nA (@450 nA) and\nIneut = Itop+ Ibot = 20.9 nA. For the \u2013Pr state these currents at 450 eV are Itop = 12 nA and\nIbot = 8.9 nA and therefore Ineut = 20.9 nA. In the energy range between 400 eV and 600\neV no core level excitations of Pt exist. This results in a constant Ineut in this photon\nenergy range. The average current Iave = (Itop + Ibot)/2 is about 10 nA for each\npolarization state (see Fig. 2 (a)). Further contributions to Itop and Ibot originate from\nphoto carriers excited at the Ti L-edge thresholds between 450 and 480 eV (internal\nphoto effect) in the PZT. Two major internal photo carrier effects might be relevant.\nFirst, the photon excitation energy is more than two orders of magnitude larger than the\nband gap of the ferroelectric PZT, which is of about 3.4 eV.[16] Therefore electron-hole\npairs were generated in the PZT (see Fig. 1 (b), process 2). Second, in case the photon\nenergy reached the Ti L2,3-edges, additional electron carriers are generated due to core\nlevel excitation processes. In contrast to the first internal photo effect, the core holes are\nstrongly localized at atomic sites and therefore cannot move under an electric field (see\nFig. 1 (b), process 3). In light of the 3 photo excitation processes, we can qualitatively\nexplain the results shown in Fig. 2 (a), if we take into account the inner potential\ndistribution (for +Pr and \u2013Pr) and the inhomogeneous photon flux inside the PZT. In\nFig. 2 (b) the charge distribution is schematically shown for the +Pr state. The\nconduction and valence energy bands for +Pr (red curves) and \u2013Pr (blue curves) are\nsketched in Fig. 2 (c) for short circuit boundary conditions. Here we assume a (slight) ptype character of the PZT bulk with the tendency to an n-type semiconductor at both\ninterfaces (see black lines for Ev (x) and Ec (x) for a hypothetical, paraelectric state of\nthe PZT). For simplification, the band diagrams are pinned at both interfaces (e.g. due\nto defects). We are aware of the fact, that the band diagram of the Pt/PZT interface is\nstill under debate and the exact band diagrams may differ correspondingly.[16] The\nbands of our back-to-back Pt/PZT/Pt Schottky barrier device are superimposed on the\n5\n\n\fpotential which originates from the depolarization field (inside the ferroelectric).[32] The\nlater is a consequence of the non-perfect screening (not shown here) of the ferroelectric\nbound charge at the metal-insulator interfaces of a ferroelectric capacitor.[28] Therefore\nwe expect a photo current Iphoto (from the internal photo effect) in the external circuit\nwith an opposite sign which reduces Ibot and adds to Itop. This current has no influence\non the neutralization current Ineut = Ibot \u2013 Iphoto + Itop+Iphoto. Please note that Ineut is\nconstant, while it's splitting into Itop and Ibot depend on the number of internal photo\ncarriers generated in the PZT. Switching the capacitor from the +Pr state to the \u2013Pr state,\nthe potential due to the depolarization field is reversed (see Fig. 2 (c)). It is likely that\nthe inner potential distribution has a strong influence on the photo carrier transport\ncurrent, which would explain the distinguish base line currents for the +Pr and \u2013Pr state.\nAnother important factor is the exponential decay of the photon flux within the\nferroelectric. In Fig. 2 (d) the photon flux attenuation described by the law of LambertBeer is schematically shown for two photon energies. At the upper Pt/PZT interface the\nflux is the same but the attenuation coefficients depend on the photon energy. Two\ncurves, at 450 eV (pre-edge region) and at 458 eV (at the TiL3 t2g edge) are qualitatively\ncompared. Overall the photo current of the irradiated ferroelectric capacitor is\ndetermined by the band diagram of metal-insulator-metal, back-to back Schottky photo\ndiodes [29-31] with the additional degree of freedom from the switchable polarization\nweighted by the photon flux decay inside the PZT. The sensitivity of photo currents on\nthe polarization state was observed by I. Boerasu et al. using UV light at 340 nm.[32] We\nlike to point out that the use of soft X-rays delivers simultaneously interesting additional\ninformation of the electronic interface structure.\nTo clarify the different form of the SXAS signal at the Ti L3,2 edge for the +Pr\nand \u2013Pr state, we compared both signals in Fig. 3 (taken the data Ibot (+/-Pr)). The signal\n\n6\n\n\fof the +Pr state (of the Ti L3 edge, t2g peak) from of Itop(+Pr) was enhanced to achieve\nthe same amplitude as the Ti L3 t2g peak of the \u2013Pr state. The considerable deviation\nfound at the L2 eg peaks (double peak structure in the \u2013Pr state, red curve) indicate a\nrather different local environment of Ti atoms at the top PZT/Pt interface in dependency\nof the polarization state. We observed a crystal field splitting \u0394CF of about 2 eV as\nindicated in Fig. 3. A closer look to the crystal field splitting in the Pr and \u2013Pr states\nshowed a clear difference in the crystal field splitting if between both polarization\nstates. In the inset in Fig. 3 the Itop (+/-Pr) are compared and we found a difference \u0394*CF\n= 0.29 eV. It is unlikely that changes in the Ti crystal field are due to ferroelectric\nswitching process alone. The extremely small structural changes between the \u2013Pr and\n+Pr states might not be relevant for such drastic changes in the observed Ti absorption\nsignals. We suggest here another scenario. The different spectra shown in Fig. 3 became\nmore significant throughout the experiment and might be related to the high photon flux\nof the synchrotron radiation. Indeed in TiO2 photo catalytic effects are known to be\nrelevant.[33] In our case the strong depolarization field inside the capacitors may lead to\na considerable diffusion of oxygen under the electric field and the irradiation. We\nunintentionally crossed the border from a non-destructive to a (partly) destructive\nexperiment. This idea is supported by the fact that after the 10 hours of beam line\nexperiments the PZT was still ferroelectric but a rather drastic change of the P vs. E\nhysteresis loop occurred (see red loop Fig. 1 (a)). This effect was even more\npronounced after experiments at the oxygen K-edge (see blue loop in Fig. 1(a)). On the\nother hand, the asymmetry in the P vs. V loop (blue curve in Fig. 1(b) and a possible\nrelation to the absorption signal raised an interesting speculation. Is it possible that the\nabsorption signals Itop (+Pr) and Itop (-Pr), as shown in Fig. 3, reflect the different\nelectronic structure of the bottom and top PZT/Pt interfaces? Indeed, the leakage\nbehavior of the ferroelectric capacitor (blue curve in Fig. 1(b)) for the positive and\n7\n\n\fnegative bias, indicate a different electronic structure between the top and bottom\ninterface. From this perspective it is reasonable to assume that the absorption signals\nprobe either the electronic structure of the top or bottom interface in dependency on the\npolarization state. The strongly distorted signal in the +Pr state means that this signal\nmight be related to the top interface. First because the photon flux is much larger (Fig. 2\n(d)) at the top interface and so photo catalytic effects are more likely than at the bottom\ninterface and because the leakage behavior is worse for the positive bias which could be\nrelated to a disturbed Ti environment (for example oxygen deficiency). Nonetheless,\nbecause the exact inner potential distribution in the PZT is unknown, we cannot role out\nthat the spectra reflect to some extend the difference of the photo current between both\ninterfaces but leaved a net photo current from the bottom to the top electrode. Further\nexperiments are necessary and the additional application of small bias field might be\nhelpful to clarify this issue.\nTo further support the distinguish role of the depolarization field, we\ninvestigated non-ferroelectric Pt/SrTiO3/Pt capacitors. Beside the dielectric material all\nother parameters (thicknesses, deposition method etc.) were the same as for the\nPt/PZT/Pt capacitor. Indeed we could not find any indication of ferroelectricity in the P\nvs. V loop. The P vs. V loop reflected the properties of a linear, highly isolating\ndielectric. In Fig. 4 the soft X-ray absorption signals are shown for a +4 V and \u20134V\nsetting. In contrast to the absorption signals of the ferroelectric capacitor shown in Fig.\n2(a), Ibot (-Pr) and Itop(+Pr) we observed a much less strong shift of the TEY in the\nPt/SrTiO3/Pt capacitor. The photo currents (Ibot and Itop) were independent whether the\nPt/SrTiO3/Pt capacitor was initially poled by +4V or \u20134V. This result clearly shows that\nno depolarization field exists in the non-polar SrTiO3 dielectric. The inset in Fig. 4\nshows a linear P vs. V dependency as expected for the linear (non-polar) dielectric\nSrTiO3. In addition the SrTiO3 experiment gives further evidence that indeed the\n8\n\n\fdepolarization field in PZT has a considerable effect on the inner potential distribution\nof Pt/PZT/Pt capacitors and originates the four distinguish base line currents shown in\nFig. 2 (a).\nFinally we discuss the probe depth of our experiment. It is known from TEY\ninvestigations of the bare surface of insulators that the probe depth is approximately 5\nnm at photon energies of several hundered eV. This is a factor \u2248 2 larger than the probe\ndepth of photoelectrons at pure metal surfaces. This fact reflects the larger cross-section\nof electrons in metals than in insulators.[17] There is no obvious reason that the probe\ndepth at metal/insulator interfaces is different. Thereofore we assume that we probe the\nelectronic structure up to 5 nm adjacent to the Pt/PZT interfaces if the absorption signal\nat the Ti L-edge of the insulator is measured. Consequently, the method offers an\ninteresting approach to study the electronic structure of the top and bottom dead\ninterfacial layers while the device is fully functioning.\nIn conclusion we presented a modified total electron yield set-up to study the current\ndistribution in ferroelectric and dielectric capacitors under soft X-ray synchrotron\nirradiation. We observed a clear difference in the photo currents between ferroelectric\nPt/PbZr0.3Ti0.7O3/Pt and dielectric Pt/SrTiO3/Pt capacitors. Our findings are explained\non the basis of the external and internal photoelectric effect, the depolarization field and\nthe Schottky barriers at the top and bottom interface of the capacitors. In addition it\nturned out, that care is needed with this approach to ensure the experiment to remain\nnon-destructive. This experimental study demonstrated SXAS to be a potential probe\nfor studying the interfacial electronic structure of planar devices under soft X-ray\nirradiation.\n\n9\n\n\fAcknowledgement\nThe author thanks Michael Hambe for carefully reading the manuscript.

(a) Hysteresis loops of a ferroelectric capacitor, for the as fabricated sample\n(solid black line), after 10 hours of irradiation at the Ti edge (red line) and after\nadditional 2 hours at the O K-edge (blue line). (b) Schematic of the modified total\nelectron yield set-up using two ammeters, one in the top and another in the bottom\nwiring line. Essential photo electric effects are labeled by 1- 3 (b).\nFig. 2. (a) Four soft x-ray absorption spectra Ibot and Itop observed for the +Pr and \u2013Pr\nstates for a Pt/PZT/Pt ferroelectric capacitor. The four base line currents at 450 eV are\nlabeled by 1 - 4 . (b) Charge distributions in the capacitor for the +Pr state. (c)\nEnergy diagrams (Ev valance band, Ec conduction band) for the PZT in the paraelectric\nstate (black) and the +Pr (red) and \u2013Pr (blue) polarization states. (c) Attenuation of the\nphoton flux inside the PZT for two photon energies.\nFig. 3. Comparison of the SXAS in the +Pr (black) and \u2013Pr state (red) detected by the\nbottom Ammeter. The signal of the \u2013 Pr state was adjusted to the amplitude of the +Pr\nstate for the L3 Ti eg state (peak at 458 eV). The inset shows a similar comparison for\nthe top ammeter, which exhibited a difference in the Ti-crystal field at the L3 edge.\nFig. 4 Four soft x-ray absorption spectra Ibot and Itop observed for a +4 V and \u20134 V\nsettings of a Pt/SrTiO3/Pt dielectric capacitor. The bias voltage V was 0 Volt. Please\nnote that the data acquisition system did not allow detecting both current polarities.\nTherefore parts of the lower to spectra were cut. This experimental restriction has no\ninfluence on the presented interpretation. The inset shows the polarization and\ndisplacement current vs. the applied bias voltage for the capacitor.\n\n11\n\n\fReferences\n[1]\n\n\"Nanoelectronics and Information Technology\", Wiley-VCH, Weinheim 2003,\ned. by R.Waser, Markus Grundmann \"The Physics of Semiconductors\",\nSpringer-Verlag, Berlin 2006.\n\n[2]\n\nK.
