Polarization rotation ideas are frequently invoked to explain the piezoelectric\nproperties. It was recently reported that lead titanate undergoes a phase transformation sequence\nP 4mm \u2192 P m \u2192 Cm \u2192 R3\u0304c at 10 K as a function of hydrostatic pressure [M. Ahart et al.\nNature Letters. 451, 545 (2008)]. We demonstrate that this interpretation is not correct by (i)\nsimulating the reported diffraction patterns, and (ii) by density-functional theory computations\nwhich show that neither the P m, Cm nor P mm2 phase is stable in the studied pressure range, and\nfurther show that octahedral tilting is the key stabilization mechanism under high pressure. Notes\non a more general ground are given to demonstrate that a continuous phase transition between\nrhombohedral and tetragonal phases via intermediate monoclinic phase is not possible. Thus, twophase co-existence in the vicinity of the phase transition region is probable and has an important\nrole for electromechanical properties.\n\nThe polarization rotation (PR) model [1, 2] has been\nproposed to explain the large electromechanical coupling\ncoefficients observed in ferroelectric perovskites in the\nvicinity of the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB).\nThe MPB region separates tetragonal and rhombohedral\nphases, which do not have a group-subgroup relationship\nand thus no continuous transition between the phases is\npossible. The most intensively studied systems are solid\nsolutions, prime examples being lead zirconate titanate,\nPb(Zrx Ti1\u2212x )O3 , (PZT) and xPb(Mg1/3 Nb2/3 )O3 -(1 \u2212\nx)PbTiO3 (PMN-PT). The essential feature of the PR\nmodel is the insertion of one (or more) low-symmetry\nphase(s) to continuously (via group-subgroup chains)\nconnect the tetragonal and rhombohedral phases separated by the MPB in order to continuously rotate the\npolarization vector by an electric field or pressure between the pseudo-cubic [001] and [111] directions along\nthe (11\u03040) plane. This rotation path was predicted to be\naccompanied by a large electromechanical response [3].\nThere are, however, several ambiguities related to the PR\nmodel (see, e.g., Ref. 4) and experimental studies interpreted in terms of this idea. As an example, the pressure\ninduced phase transitions of lead titanate (PbTiO3 , PT)\nare considered below. Hydrostatic pressure induces similar structural changes as are observed to occur due to the\nsubstitution of Ti by a larger cation, such as Zr, causing\nso called \"chemical pressure\".\nAt high temperatures PT undergoes a phase transition between the P 4mm and P m3\u0304m phases [5]. At room\ntemperature PT transforms to a cubic phase through a\nsecond-order transition at 12.1 GPa[6], whereas it was\npredicted through density-functional theory (DFT) computations that a phase transition between P 4mm and\nR3c phases occurs at 9 GPa at 0 K [7]. Notably the\nlatter phase transition is similar to the phase transition\nobserved in PZT as a function of Zr composition. In\n\nsimplest terms, one expects to have three different phase\nboundaries in the pressure-temperature plane of PT, separating the P 4mm and P m3\u0304m, P 4mm and R3c and R3c\nand P m3\u0304m phases. A very different interpretation was\nrecently given in Ref. 8, according to which the phase\ntransition from the P 4mm to R3\u0304c phase would occur\nvia monoclinic phases, which was further claimed to give\nsupport to the PR model. We demonstrate that (i) the\nsingle phase model is incorrect in the vicinity of the phase\ntransition, (ii) the monoclinic distortions reported earlier are not stable, (iii) summarize the arguments which\nshow that the phase transition must be of first order and\n(iv) outline the method for determining the piezoelectric\nproperties in the vicinity of the phase boundary.\nComputational methods. The DFT code ABINIT [9,\n10] was used to compute the total energies and phonon\nfrequencies and eigenvectors [11] at different pressures.\nThe computations were carried out within the localdensity approximation and a plane wave basis. Normconserving pseudopotentials were generated using the\nOPIUM package [12]. A more detailed description of\nthe computational approach is available in Ref. 7. For\nthe simulation of the X-ray diffraction patterns the Powder Cell program was used [13]. The lattice parameters\nwere adapted from Ref. 8. The asymmetric unit was\nnot given in Ref. 8, and thus the atomic positions were\nestimated using the values found from the DFT computations, which are close to the values estimated from our\nhigh-pressure neutron powder diffraction experiments at\nfew GPa pressures [14].\nNotes on the X-ray diffraction and Raman scattering\nanalysis. According to Ref. 8, PT undergoes a phase\ntransformation sequence P 4mm \u2192 P m \u2192 Cm \u2192 R3\u0304c\nat 10 K as a function of hydrostatic pressure. We show\nthat the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern collected at\n13.2 GPa [8] is not consistent with the reported P m sym-\n\n\f2\nmetry by simulating the corresponding pattern. Fig. 1\nshows that the reflection positions and intensities significantly deviate from the experimental ones and also from\nthe fits (shown by black continuous lines). It is worth to\nnote that in the case of PT the pseudo-cubic 110 reflections have the strongest XRD intensities. The 13.2 GPa\nXRD pattern shown in Fig. 1 more likely corresponds to\na two-phase diffraction pattern. This is seen by studying\nthe intensities of the 100 and 001 reflections: for tetragonal and pseudo-tetragonal structures the intensity ratio\nshould roughly be 2:1 (as is seen from the diffraction pattern collected at 8.4 GPa, Fig. 1), whereas it is roughly\n0.9:1 for the 13.2 GPa data.\nIt was stated that the Raman scattering data reflect\nthe monoclinic MC (P m phase) to monoclinic MA (Cm)\nand the monoclinic MA to rhombohedral phase transitions [8]. We find this assignment questionable, since the\nphonon symmetries, central for the phase transition studies, were not addressed. For example, the B1 -symmetry\nnormal mode in the P 4mm phase breaks the fourfold\nsymmetry [16], whereas the A1 symmetry modes preserve\nit. The spectral features below 100 cm\u22121 include several\npeaks from the A1 symmetry modes alone, due to the\nstrong anharmonicity of the A1 (1TO) mode [17, 18], in\naddition to the E-symmetry modes and Rayleigh scattering (which dominates the region close to the laser line,\nas was noted in Ref. 6). It was rather recently that the\nA1 (1TO) mode was identified in PT[17, 18]: many earlier\nassignments dismissed this mode since the line shape was\nvery asymmetric and turned out to be consisted of many\nsubpeaks. In practice this means that, in the vicinity of\nthe phase transition, it is hard to identify the number of\nmodes at the low-frequency region, not to mention the\ndifficulty of identifying their symmetries from the spectra collected without proper polarization measurements.\nThis, in turn, prevents space group assignments.\nDFT studies. DFT computations predict that PT undergoes a phase transition from the P 4mm phase to the\nR3c phase at around 9 GPa [7]. In contrast, a phase\ntransition sequence P 4mm \u2192 Cm \u2192 R3m \u2192 P m3\u0304m\n(phase transitions at 10, 12 and 22 GPa, respectively)\nwas found in Ref. 19. The high-pressure end of this transition was more recently modified to form the sequence\nR3m \u2192 R3c \u2192 R3\u0304c \u2192 R3c with phase transitions occurring at 18, 20 and 60 GPa, respectively [8]. In addition to\nthe phases listed in Ref. 7, we carried out similar computations for the P m and P mm2 phases. For consistency,\nphonon frequencies of the R3c phase were computed at\n9, 10 and 15 GPa pressures at the Brillouin zone center\nand boundary points.\nThe main outcomes of our present and earlier computations are: (i) the R3m phase is not stable (octahedral tilting makes R3c phase favorable above 9 GPa), (ii)\nabove 9 GPa tetragonal (P 4mm and I4cm), orthorhombic (Cmm2 and P mm2) and monoclinic (P m and Cm)\nphases were revealed to be unstable by the Brillouin\n\nzone boundary modes and higher enthalpy values, (iii)\nno support for an intermediate phase was found, and\n(iv) no phonon instabilities were observed in the R3c\nphase. In contrast, one of the Brillouin zone corner point\nL = ( \u03c0a \u03c0a \u03c0a ) modes of the R3m phase was unstable at\n9 GPa pressure. The mode involved only oxygen displacements (this was the only mode which was found to\nbe unstable: all modes at the (000), (00 \u03c0a ) and ( \u03c0a \u03c0a 0)\nsymmetry points were positive). The mode is depicted\nin Fig. 2. This corresponds to the mode were the upper and lower octahedra are tilted clockwise and anticlockwise about the threefold symmetry axis, thus again\ndemonstrating that the octahedral tilting stabilizes the\nR3c phase. This is due to the fact that octahedral tilting\nallows a more efficient compression [7, 20, 21].\nWe note that since the R3m phase is not stable, it\nis somewhat hypotetical to consider the instability of\nan unstable phase. A more rigorous treatment, starting from the P 4mm phase, is given in Ref. 7, with the\nsame outcome. Thus, the energetically favorable phase\nwas obtained by allowing the crystal to relax according\nto the normal mode displacements of the unstable modes\nseen in the P 4mm phase. Thus the transition between\nP 4mm and R3c phases is characterized by two-phase coexistence, in an analogous way to the phase transitions\nseen in PZT as a function of composition. This is an\nimportant prediction as it in turn suggests that the twophase co-existence has a crucial role for the piezoelectric\nproperties near the phase transition pressures in PT, in\na similar way as was demonstrated in Ref. 22 for PZT in\nthe vicinity of the MPB.\nSymmetry considerations. Group-theoretical analysis\nindicates that, although the phase transition between\nmonoclinic and tetragonal phases can be continuous, the\ntransition between rhombohedral and monoclinic phases\nmust be of first order [23]. Thus, even if one would have\na monoclinic phase, it would not make the transformation path continuous. First-order transitions are often\ncharacterized by the two-phase co-existence, one phase\nbeing metastable over a finite temperature or pressure\nrange. This is consistent with the experimentally known\nfeatures of PZT according to which there is two-phase coexistence [21, 24, 25]. Neutron and X-ray powder diffraction studies revealed that the polarization vector in the\nmonoclinic Cm phase is very close to the pseudo-cubic\n[001] direction, and hardly rotates from that direction\n[21, 25], in contrast to what one anticipates from the PR\nmodel. Thus the polarization vector changes discontinuously when the transition from the pseudo-tetragonal\nmonoclinic to the rhombohedral phase occurs. As Li et\nal. noted, \"the availability of multiple phases at the MPB\nmakes it possible for the polarization to thread through\nthe ceramic\"[22].\nHow to model the piezoelectric response? The piezoelectric response can be divided to extrinsic and intrinsic contributions. The latter is due to the changes in\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 1: X-ray diffraction data collected on PT at 10 K. The figure is adapted from Ref. 8. The green and blue lines (middle\npanels) were added by us. The green line shows the simulated P m pattern using the lattice parameters given in Ref. 8. The\nmodel where the a and b axes are switched (blue line) does not improve the fit [15]. Neither of the one-phase P m structure\nmodel fits the peak (black lines) positions and intensities (e.g., the reflection labelled as (1\u030410) is not modelled, and cannot be\nexplained by preferred orientation).\n\nelectron densities as a response to an applied field or\nstress and can be computed through standard densityfunctional theory methods. The extrinsic part is significantly more challenging, as it involves domain wall motions and changes in the phase fractions in the vicinity of\nthe phase-boundary (e.g., between tetragonal and rhombohedral phases). In the case of poled ceramics one first\ncomputes the necessary angular averages of the piezoelectric constants and takes their dependence on temperature, composition or stress into account. This dependence is notable in the vicinity of the phase transition.\nFor intrinsic contribution such a computation is rather\nstraightforward. However, the description of domain wall\nmotion due to an applied electric field or stress for different composition or at different temperatures is nontrivial\ntask.\nIn conclusion, evidence against the applicability of the\npolarization rotation model to perovskites is strong. Instead, the currently known best piezoelectric perovskites\nposses a so-called morphotropic phase boundary at which\n\na first-order phase transition between rhombohedral and\ntetragonal (or pseudo-tetragonal) phases takes place.\nFor the electromechanical properties it is important to\nnote that this transition exhibits two-phase co-existence.\nStructural factors responsible for the stabilization of the\nrhombohedral phase, either at large hydrostatic pressures\nor large chemical pressures (as occurs in Pb(Zrx Ti1\u2212x )O3\nwith increasing x) were addressed.\nY.
