Let Hc (M ) stand for the path connected identity component\nof the group of all compactly supported homeomorphisms of a manifold\nM . It is shown that Hc (M ) is perfect and simple under mild assumptions\non M . Next, conjugation-invariant norms on Hc (M ) are considered and\nthe boundedness of Hc (M ) and its subgroups is investigated. Finally, the\nstructure of the universal covering group of Hc (M ) is studied.\n\n1. Introduction\nLet M be a topological metrizable manifold of dimension n \u2265 1, possibly\nwith boundary, and let H(M) (resp. Hc (M)) be the path connected identity\ncomponent of the group of all (resp. compactly supported) homeomorphisms\nof a manifold M endowed with the compact-open topology. In this paper we\nwill deal with algebraic properties of the group Hc (M) and of its universal\ncovering.\nRecall that a group G is called perfect if it is equal to its own commutator\nsubgroup [G, G]. That is, H1 (G) = 0. The following basic fact is probably\nwell-known but we have not found it explicitly proven in the literature.\nTheorem 1.1. Assume that either M is compact (possibly with boundary), or\nM admits a compact exhaustion, i.e. there is a sequence of compact submanio\nfolds with boundary S\n(Mi )\u221e\ni=1 with dim Mi = dim M = n such that M1 \u2282 M2 \u2282\n\u221e\nM2 \u2282 . . . and M = i=1 Mi . Then the group Hc (M) is perfect.\nThe proof of the perfectness is a consequence of Mather's paper [14] combined with Edwards and Kirby [7], Corollary 1.3. In the case n = 1 and M\nwith boundary the proof requires an additional argument. See section 3. A\nspecial case of Theorem 1.1 was already proved by Fisher [8] (see also Anderson [2]). Observe that McDuff in [16] proved that H(M) is perfect provided\n\nDate: March 18, 2011.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 58D05, 57S05.\nKey words and phrases. Group of homeomorphisms, universal covering group, perfect\ngroup, bounded group, fragmentation, isotopy.\nPartially supported by the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education and the\nAGH grant n. 11.420.04.\n1\n\n\fM is the interior of a compact manifold with boundary. There exist some generalizations of Theorem 1.1 (see, e.g., Fukui and Imanishi [10], and Rybicki\n[18]).\nIf M is a smooth manifold then Theorem 1.1 has its smooth analogue. Let\nD(M) be the identity component of the group of all compactly supported\nC \u221e -diffeomorphisms of M. Thurston proved that D(M) is perfect and simple (see [23], [4]). Also Mather in [15] proved the same in the class of C r diffeomorphisms unless r = dim M + 1. Analogous results for classical groups\nof diffeomorphisms are also known ([3], [4], [11], [20]).\nIn the case of a manifold with boundary M we denote by M o the interior\nof M, and by \u2202M the boundary of M. We will consider the following groups:\nHc (M o ) \u2264 Hc\u2202 (M) \u2264 Hc (M) \u2264 H(M o ).\nHere h \u2208 Hc\u2202 (M) if there is a compactly supported isotopy ht connecting\nh0 = id with h1 = h such that ht = id on \u2202M for all t. Moreover, Hc (M)\nidentifies with a subgroup of H(M o ) by restricting elements of Hc (M) to M o .\nTheorem 1.2. If the boundary \u2202M is compact then Hc\u2202 (M) is a perfect group.\nConcerning the simplicity of Hc (M) we have the following\nCorollary 1.3. Let M be connected and satisfy the hypothesis of Theorem\n1.1. Then M is boundaryless (i.e. \u2202M = \u2205) if and only if Hc (M) is simple.\nThe proof will be given in section 4 together with further comments on the\nsimplicity by using some ideas of Ling [13].\nConjugation-invariant norms related to homeomorphism groups on M are\nconsidered in section 5. Recall that a group is bounded if every conjugationinvariant norm is bounded on it. Following an argument from [6] we will prove\nin section 6 the following\nTheorem 1.4. Under the assumption of Theorem 1.1 on M, Hc (M) is bounded\nif and only if fragM is bounded, where fragM is the fragmentation norm on M\nwith respect to homeomorphisms. In particular, Hc (Rn ) is bounded.\nAlso we have the following boundedness theorem.\nTheorem 1.5. Let \u2202M be compact. If the group Hc (M) is bounded then\nH(\u2202M ) is bounded also. Moreover, if the group Hc (M o ) is bounded then so is\nthe group Hc\u2202 (M).\nObserve that Hc (M o ) is bounded if M o is portable (sect. 6). In [20] the\nsecond-named author proved that H(M o ) is bounded provided so is Hc (M o ).\nThe last part of the paper is devoted to the structure of the universal coverings of some homeomorphism groups. Let Hc (M)\u223c denote the universal\ncovering group of Hc (M).\n2\n\n\fTheorem 1.6. Let n = dim M \u2265 2 or \u2202M = \u2205. The group Hc (M)\u223c is perfect.\nMoreover, the groups Hc (Rn )\u223c and Hc (Rn+ )\u223c are acyclic, where Rn+ = {x \u2208\nRn : xn \u2265 0} is the half-space.\nThe proof will be given in section 7. We will also study the problem of\nboundedness.\nTheorem 1.7. Let fragiso\nM be the isotopy fragmentation norm on the universal\ncovering group Hc (M)\u223c (c.f. sect.7). Suppose that dim M \u2265 2 or \u2202M = \u2205.\nThen Hc (M)\u223c is bounded if and only if fragiso\nM is bounded.\nWe emphasize that many facts presented in this paper are specific for the\ntopological category, that is there are no longer true in the smooth (or even\nLipschitz) category. See, e.g., Remark 3.4 and Prop. 6.3.\n2. Fragmentation property and isotopy extension theorem\nThe results of this paper depend essentially on the deformation properties\nfor the spaces of imbeddings obtained by Edwards and Kirby in [7]. See also\nSiebenmann [22]. Let us recall basic notions and facts from [7].\nGiven a subset S \u2282 M, by HS (M) we denote the path connected identity\ncomponent of the subgroup of all elements of H(M) with compact support\ncontained in S. By a ball (resp. half-ball ) B we mean rel. compact open ball\n(resp. half-ball with \u2202B = B \u2229 \u2202M ) embedded in M with its closure. By B we\ndenote the family of all balls and half-balls in M.\nUsing the Alexander trick, we have that H(Rn ) coincides with the group\nof all compactly supported homeomorphisms of Rn . In fact, if supp(g) is\ncompact, we define an isotopy gt : Rn \u2192 Rn , t \u2208 I, from the identity to g, by\n\u001a\n\u0001\ntg 1t x f or t > 0\ngt (x) =\nx\nf or t = 0.\nIn particular, for every ball B in M the group HB (M) consists of all homeomorphisms compactly supported in B. Observe that the Alexander trick is\nno longer true in the smooth category.\nLet us formulate the fragmentation property in the following stronger way.\nDefinition 2.1. Let U be an open covering of M. A subgroup G \u2264 H(M)\nis locally continuously factorizable if for any finite subcovering (Ui )di=1 of B,\nthere exist a neighborhood P of id \u2208 G and continuous mappings \u03c3i : P \u2192 G,\ni = 1, . . . , d, such that for all f \u2208 P one has\nsupp(\u03c3i (f )) \u2282 Ui , \u2200i.\n\nf = \u03c31 (f ) . . . \u03c3d (f ),\n\nThroughout for a topological group G by PG we will denote the totality of\npaths \u03b3 : I \u2192 G with \u03b3(0) = e (where I = [0, 1]). Observe that Def. 2.1 can\nalso be formulated for PG rather than G, where G \u2264 H(M).\n3\n\n\fFrom now on M is a metrizable topological manifold. If U is a subset\nof M, a proper imbedding of U into M is an imbedding h : U \u2192 M such\nthat h\u22121 (\u2202M) = U \u2229 \u2202M. An isotopy of U into M is a family of imbeddings\nht : U \u2192 M, t \u2208 I, such that the map h : U \u00d7I \u2192 M defined by h(x, t) = ht (x)\nis continuous. An isotopy is proper if each imbedding in it is proper. Now let\nC and U be subsets of M with C \u2286 U. By I(U, C; M) we denote the space of\nproper imbeddings of U into M which equal the identity on C, endowed with\nthe compact-open topology.\nSuppose X is a space with subsets A and B. A deformation of A into B is a\ncontinuous mapping \u03c6 : A \u00d7 I \u2192 X such that \u03c6|A\u00d70 = idA and \u03c6(A \u00d7 1) \u2286 B.\nIf P is a subset of I(U; M) and \u03c6 : P \u00d7 I \u2192 I(U; M) is a deformation of P,\nwe may equivalently view \u03c6 as a map \u03c6 : P \u00d7 I \u00d7 U \u2192 M such that for each\nh \u2208 P and t \u2208 I, the map \u03c6(h, t) : U \u2192 M is a proper imbedding.\nIf W \u2286 U, a deformation \u03c6 : P \u00d7 I \u2192 I(U; M) is modulo W if \u03c6(h, t)|W =\nh|W for all h \u2208 P and t \u2208 I.\nSuppose \u03c6 : P \u00d7 I \u2192 I(U; M) and \u03c8 : Q \u00d7 I \u2192 I(U; M) are deformations\nof subsets of I(U; M) and suppose that \u03c6(P \u00d7 1) \u2286 Q. Then the composition\nof \u03c8 with \u03c6, denoted by \u03c8 \u22c6 \u03c6, is the deformation \u03c8 \u22c6 \u03c6 : P \u00d7 I \u2192 I(U; M)\ndefined by\n\u001a\n\u03c6(h, 2t)\nf or t \u2208 [0, 1/2]\n\u03c8 \u22c6 \u03c6(h, t) =\n\u03c8(\u03c6(h, 1), 2t \u2212 1) f or t \u2208 [1/2, 1].\nThe main result of [7] is the following\nTheorem 2.2. Let M be a topological manifold and let U be a neighborhood in\nM of a compact subset C. For any neighborhood Q of the inclusion i : U \u2282 M\nin I(U; M) there are a neighborhood P of i \u2208 I(U; M) and a deformation\n\u03c6 : P \u00d7 I \u2192 Q into I(U, C; M) which is modulo the complement of a compact\nneighborhood of C in U and such that \u03c6(i, t) = i for all t. We have also\nthat if Di \u2282 Vi , i = 1, . . . , q, is a finite family of closed subsets Di with\ntheir neighborhoods Vi , then \u03c6 can be chosen so that the restriction of \u03c6 to\n(P \u2229 I(U, U \u2229 Vi ; M)) \u00d7 I assumes its values in I(U, U \u2229 Di ; M) for each i.\nMoreover, if M has compact boundary \u2202M then \u03c6 restricted to (P \u2229I(U, \u2202M \u2229\nU; M)) \u00d7 I takes its values into I(U, \u2202M \u2229 U; M).\nThe first part coincides with Theorem 5.1[7]. The second part is specified\nin Remark 7.2 in [7].\nWe can derive from Theorem 2.2 the following fragmentation theorem.\nTheorem 2.3. Let M be a compact manifold, possibly with boundary. Then\nthe groups Hc (M), Hc\u2202 (M), PHc (M) and PHc\u2202 (M) are locally continuously\nfactorizable, i.e. they satisfy Def. 2.1.\nProof. (See also [7].) We will consider only the case of Hc (M), the remaining\nones being analogous. First we have to shrink the cover (Ui )di=1 d times, that\n4\n\n\fis we choose an open Ui,j for every i = 1, . . . , d and j = 0, . . . , d with Ui,0 = Ui\nS\nsuch that di=1 Ui,j = M for all j and such that cl(Ui,j+1) \u2282 Ui,j for all i, j.\nWe make use of Theorem 2.2 d times with q = 1. Namely,\nSi\u22121 for i = 1, . . . , d\nwe have a neighborhood Pi of the identity in I(M, \u03b1=1 U\u03b1,i\u22121 ; M) and a\ndeformation \u03c6i : Pi \u00d7 I \u2192 Hc (M) which is modulo M \\ Ui,0 and which takes\nS\nits values in I(M, i\u03b1=1 cl(U\u03b1,i ); M) and such that \u03c6i (id, t) = id for all t. Here\nS\nwe apply Theorem 2.2 with C = cl(Ui,i ), U = Ui,0 , D1 = i\u22121\n\u03b1=1 cl(U\u03b1,i ) and\nSi\u22121\nV1 = \u03b1=1 U\u03b1,i\u22121 . Taking a neighborhood P of id small enough, we have\nthat \u03c6d \u22c6 * * * \u22c6 \u03c61 restricted to P \u00d7 I is well defined. For every h \u2208 P we set\nh0 = h and hi = \u03c6i \u22c6 * * * \u22c6 \u03c61 (h, 1), i = 1, . . . , d. It follows that hd = id and\nQ\n\u22121\nh = di=1 hi h\u22121\ni\u22121 . It suffices to define \u03c3i : P \u2192 Hc (M) by \u03c3i (h) = hi hi\u22121 for\nall i.\n\u0003\nCorollary 2.4. Let ht : M \u2192 M, t \u2208 I, be an isotopy of a compact manifold\nM with h0 = id, and let (Ui )di=1 be an open cover of M. Then ht can be\nwritten as a composition of isotopies ht = hk,t hk\u22121,t . . . h1,t , where each isotopy\nhj,t : M \u2192 M is supported by some Ui . Moreover, if ht |\u2202M = id for all t, then\nhj,t |\u2202M = id for all j and t. The same is true for homeomorphisms instead of\nisotopies.\nAnother important consequence of Theorem 2.2 is the following Isotopy\nExtension Theorem.\nTheorem 2.5. [7] Let ft be an isotopy in H(M) and let C \u2282 M be a compact\nset. Then for any open neighborhood U of the track of C by ft given by\nS\nt\u2208[0,1] ft (C) there is an isotopy gt in Hc (M) such that gt = ft on C and\nsupp(gt ) \u2282 U.\n3. Perfectness of Hc (M) and Hc\u2202 (M)\nThe goal of this section is to give the proof of Theorem 1.1. We begin with\nthe following fact, with a straightforward proof, which plays a basic role in\nstudies on homeomorphism groups.\nLemma 3.1. [14](Basic lemma) Let B \u2282 M be a ball and U \u2282 M be an open\nsubset such that B \u2282 U. Then there are \u03c6 \u2208 HU (M) and a homomorphism\nS : HB (M) \u2192 HU (M) such that h = [S(h), \u03c6] for all h \u2208 HB (M).\nProof. First choose a larger ball B \u2032 such that B \u2282 B \u2032 \u2282 B \u2032 \u2282 U. Next, fix\np \u2208 \u2202B\u2032 and set B0 = B. There exists a sequence of balls (Bk )\u221e\nk=1 such that\n\u2032\n\u221e\ncl(Bk ) \u2282 B for all k, where the family (Bk )k=0 is pairwise disjoint, locally\nfinite in B \u2032 , and Bk \u2192 p as k \u2192 \u221e. Choose a homeomorphism \u03c6 \u2208 HU (M)\nsuch that \u03c6(Bk\u22121 ) = Bk for k = 1, 2, . . .. Here we use the fact that HU (M)\nacts transitively on the family of balls in B \u2032 , c.f. [12].\n5\n\n\fNext we define a homomorphism S : HB (M) \u2192 HU (M) by the formula\nS(h) = \u03c6k h\u03c6\u2212k on Bk , k = 0, 1, . . .\nS\nand S(h) = id outside \u221e\nk=0 Bk . It is clear that h = [S(h), \u03c6], as required. \u0003\n\nThe above reasoning appeared in Mather's paper [14]. Actually Mather\nproved also the acyclicity of H(Rn ). It is easily seen that [14] and Lemma 3.1\nare no longer true for C 1 homeomorphisms. However, Tsuboi gave an excellent\nimprovement of this reasoning and adapted it for C r -diffeomorphisms with\nsmall r, see [24].\n\nCorollary 3.2. Assume that either\n(1) \u2202M 6= \u2205 with dim M \u2265 2, and B, U \u2282 M are such that B is a half-ball,\nand U is open with B \u2282 U; or\n(2) M = N \u00d7 R, where N is a manifold, and B = N \u00d7 I, U = N \u00d7 J\nwhere I, J \u2282 R are open intervals with the closure of I contained in J.\nThen there are \u03c6 \u2208 HU (M) and a homomorphism S : HB (M) \u2192 HU (M)\nsuch that h = [S(h), \u03c6] for all h \u2208 HB (M). Moreover, in the case (1), if\nh \u2208 HB (M) satisfies h = id on \u2202M then S(h) = id on \u2202M .\nThe proof is analogous to that of Lemma 3.1.\nSuppose that {U\nfinite family of open sets\nSi }i\u2208N is a pairwise disjoint, locally\no\n\u2202\nof M . Put U = i Ui . Let H[U ] (M) (resp. H[U ] (M)) denote the group of all\nhomeomorphisms from Hc (M) (resp. Hc\u2202 (M)) supported in U suchSthat for\nthe decomposition h = h1 h2 . . . resulting from the partition U = i Ui one\nhas hi \u2208 HUi (M) for all i.\nCorollary 3.3. Let Bi \u2282 Ui , i \u2208 N, and let the pair (Bi , Ui ) be suchSas in\nLemma 3.1 or Corol. 3.2. Then any element h \u2208 H[B] (M) (where B = i Bi )\nis expressed as h = h\u0303h\u0304, where h\u0303, h\u0304 \u2208 H[U ] (M). Moreover, we can arrange so\n\u2202\n\u2202\nthat if h \u2208 H[B]\n(M) then h\u0303, h\u0304 \u2208 H[U\n] (M).\nIn fact, we can glue together S(hi ) and \u03c6i obtained for particular Ui .\nProof of Theorem 1.1 for n > 1 or \u2202M = \u2205. For M compact it follows from\nCorol. 2.4, Lemma 3.1, Corol. 3.2(1) and, for \u2202M 6= \u2205 and dim M = 1, from\nthe fact that H([0, 1]) is perfect. The proof of the latter fact will follow from\nthe proof of Theorem 1.2 below. Suppose now that M admits a compact\nexhaustion. If h \u2208 Hc (M) then there are j \u2208 N and an isotopy ht such that\nh0 = id, h1 = h, and supp(ht ) \u2282 Mj for all t. In view of Corol. 2.2 it follows\nthat h|Mj can be written as h|Mj = hd . . . h1 such that hi \u2208 HBi (Mj ), where Bi\nis a ball or half-ball of Mi for i = 1, . . . , d. Moreover, we have hi = id on \u2202Mj\nfor all i. Then due to Corol. 3.2(1) we have hi = [Si (hi ), \u03c6i ] and Si (hi ) = id\non \u2202Mj for each i. Is is easily seen that \u03c6i may be defined as an element of\n6\n\n\fHc (M) supported in the interior of Mj+1 . Thus extending each hi to M by\nputting hi = id off Mj , the perfectness of Hc (M) follows. \u0003\nProof of Theorem 1.1 for n = 1 and \u2202M 6= \u2205, and of Theorem 1.2. Let M\nbe a manifold with boundary \u2202. By a collar neighborhood of \u2202 we mean a\nset P = \u2202 \u00d7 [0, 1] embedded in M, where \u2202 \u00d7 {0} identifies with \u2202. It is\nwell-known that such a neighborhood exists.\nIn the case of 1.1 we have \u2202 = {0}. In view of Theorem 2.3 it suffices to\nconsider Hc (\u2202 \u00d7 R+ ), where R+ = [0, \u221e). For any f \u2208 Hc (\u2202 \u00d7 R+ ) there is a\nsequence of reals from (0,1)\n(3.1)\n\n1 > b1 > b\u03041 > \u01011 > a1 > b2 > . . . > bk > b\u0304k > \u0101k > ak > . . . > 0,\n\ntending to 0, and h \u2208 Hc (\u2202 \u00d7 R+ ) such that\n\u221e\n[\n[\u0101k , b\u0304k ].\n(3.2)\nh = f on \u2202 \u00d7\nk=1\n\nMoreover, setting Ak := \u2202 \u00d7 (ak , bk ) and A :=\n(3.3)\n\nsupp(h) \u2282 A,\n\nS\u221e\n\nk=1 Ak ,\n\nwe may also have that\n\nand\nS\u221e that for the decomposition h = h1 h2 . . . resulting from the partition A =\nk=1 Ak and from (3.3) we have\n(3.4)\n\nhk \u2208 HAk (\u2202 \u00d7 R+ ) for all k.\n\nThe condition (3.4) means that we exclude any twisting of hk .\nIn order to show the above statements we apply Theorem 2.5 for M o . This\nenables us to define recurrently bk > b\u0304k > \u0101k > ak and h|\u2202\u00d7[ak ,bk ] for k =\n1, 2, . . .. In fact, let ft be an isotopy in Hc (\u2202 \u00d7 R+ ) connecting f with the\nidentity. Suppose we have defined 1 > b1 > . . . > ak\u22121 and g \u2208 Hc (\u2202 \u00d7 R+ )\nSk\u22121\nSk\u22121\nAi , and gi \u2208 HAi (\u2202 \u00d7\n[\u0101i , b\u0304i ], supp(g) \u2282 i=1\nsuch that g = f on \u2202 \u00d7 i=1\nR+ ) for all i \u2264 k \u2212 1. Now it suffices to take\nS ak\u22121 > bk > b\u0304k > \u0101k > ak in\nsuch a way that \u2202 \u00d7 (0, bk ] is disjoint with t\u2208[0,1] ft\u22121 (\u2202 \u00d7 [ak\u22121 , 1]). In view\nof Theorem 2.5 we get an isotopy h\u0304t such that h\u0304t = ft on \u2202 \u00d7 [\u0101k , b\u0304k ] and\nsupp(h\u0304t ) \u2282 \u2202 \u00d7 (ak , bk ). Next we define h on \u2202 \u00d7 [ak , 1] by gluing together g\nand h\u03041 . Continuing this procedure we define h \u2208 H\u2202 (\u2202 \u00d7 R+ ) fulfilling (3.2),\n(3.3) and (3.4). Here we put h(x, 0) = (x, 0) for all x \u2208 \u2202.\nNext we set h\u2032 := h\u22121 f , that is f = hh\u2032 . It follows that h\u2032 also enjoys the\nproperties (3.2), (3.3) and (3.4) with a suitably chosen sequence similar to\n(3.1).\nLet Uk = (\u00e3k , b\u0303k ), where \u00e3k , b\u0303k \u2208 (0, 1), k = 1, 2, . . ., are such that \u00e3k\u22121 >\nb\u0303k > bk > ak > \u00e3k for all k (b\u03030 = 1). Now in view of Corollaries 3.2 and 3.3 with\n\u2202\nM = \u2202 \u00d7R+ h belongs to the commutator subgroup of the group H[U\n] (\u2202 \u00d7R+ ),\nS\n\u2202\nwhere U = k Uk . More precisely h = [h\u0303, h\u0304] for h\u0303, h\u0304 \u2208 H[U ] (\u2202 \u00d7 R+ ). It is\n7\n\n\feasily seen that h\u0303, h\u0304 \u2208 Hc\u2202 (\u2202 \u00d7 R+ ). The same is true for h\u2032 . Thus Hc\u2202 (\u2202 \u00d7 R+ )\nis a perfect group. \u0003\nRemark 3.4. (1) Tsuboi gave another proof of the perfectness of H(R+ ) in\n[25]. He did not use [7] in it.\n(2) Given a smooth manifold with boundary M of dimension \u2265 2, it is\nknown that the group D(M) is perfect (see Rybicki [17]; also Abe and Fukui\n[1] by using a different method). For n = 1 D(M) is not perfect. In particular,\nFukui in [9] calculated that H1 (D(R+ )) = R.\n(3) Let Rn+ = [0, \u221e)\u00d7Rn\u22121 be the half-space and 0 \u2264 s \u2264 \u221e. Let Ds (Rn+ ) be\nthe compactly supported identity component of the subgroup of all elements\nof D(Rn+ ) which are s-tangent to the identity on \u2202Rn+ . Here f is 0-tangent to\nid means that f = id on \u2202Rn+ . If 0 \u2264 s < \u221e then Ds (Rn+ ) is not perfect. In\nfact, for any diffeomorphisms f, g \u2208 Ds (Rn+ ) we have\nD s+1 (f g)(0) = D s+1 f (0) + D s+1g(0),\n\nD s+1 f \u22121 (0) = \u2212D s+1 f (0).\n\nTherefore if we choose h \u2208 Ds (Rn+ ) such that D s+1h(0) 6= 0, the above equalities yield that h cannot be in the commutator subgroup.\nFinally, let us indicate further perfectness result concerning homeomorphism\ngroups. Let M be a compact manifold with boundary \u2202. Let \u2202 = \u2202i , i =\n1, . . . , k, be the family of all connected components of the boundary \u2202 of M,\nthat is \u2202 = \u22021 \u222a . . . \u222a \u2202k . Let K = {1, . . . , k}. For any J \u2282 K let H(M o , J)\ndenote all the elements of H(M o ) that can beSjoined with the identity by an\nisotopy which stabilizes near \u2202J , where \u2202J := i\u2208J \u2202i . In particular, H(M o ) =\nH(M o , \u2205) and Hc (M o ) = H(M o , K). Then we have\nTheorem 3.5. [16] The groups H(M o , J), where J \u2282 K, are perfect.\nFor the proof, see also [20]. The proof is no longer valid if we drop the\nassumption that M o is the interior of a manifold with boundary, e.g. if M is\nthe cylinder S1 \u00d7 R with attached infinitely many handles.\n4. On the simplicity of Hc (M)\nThe following result is related to Ling's paper [13].\nProposition 4.1. Under the hypothesis of 1.1, there does not exist any fixed\npoint free normal subgroup of Hc (M).\nProof. Suppose that G is a fixed point free normal subgroup of Hc (M). It\nfollows that if M has boundary then dim M \u2265 2. Choose a cover U \u2282 B such\nthat for any U \u2208 U there is f \u2208 G such that U and f (U) are disjoint. Take a\ncover V which is starwise finer than U. This is possible since M is metrizable,\n8\n\n\fso paracompact. We may assume that Hc (M) is factorizable with respect to\nV (see Def. 5.1(1) and Prop. 5.2 below). In view of the commutator equalities\n[f g, h] = f [g, h]f \u22121[f, h],\n\n[f, gh] = [f, g]g[f, h]g \u22121\n\nand Theorem 1.1, it follows that\nHc (M) = [Hc (M), Hc (M)] =\n\nY\n\n[HU (M), HU (M)].\n\nU \u2208U\n\nLet [h1 , h2 ] \u2208 [HU (M), HU (M)] with U \u2208 U and f \u2208 G such that U \u2229f (U) = \u2205.\nThen [h1 , h2 ] = [[h1 , f ], h2 ] \u2208 G. Thus Hc (M) \u2282 G as required.\n\u0003\nProof of Corol. 1.3. (\u21d2) It follows from a theorem of Ling [13] since Hc (M)\nis factorizable (Prop. 5.2 below) and transitively inclusive. The latter means\nthat for any U, V \u2208 B there is h \u2208 Hc (M) such that h(U) \u2282 V .\n(\u21d0) Hc (M o ) is a normal subgroup of Hc (M). \u0003\nCorollary 4.2. If \u2202M 6= \u2205, Hc\u2202 (M) is not simple\nIn fact, Hc (M o ) is a proper normal subgroup of Hc\u2202 (M).\n5. Conjugation-invariant norms\nThe notion of the conjugation-invariant norm is a basic tool in studies on\nthe structure of groups. Let G be a group. A conjugation-invariant norm (or\nnorm for short) on G is a function \u03bd : G \u2192 [0, \u221e) which satisfies the following\nconditions. For any g, h \u2208 G\n(1) \u03bd(g) > 0 if and only if g 6= e;\n(2) \u03bd(g \u22121 ) = \u03bd(g);\n(3) \u03bd(gh) \u2264 \u03bd(g) + \u03bd(h);\n(4) \u03bd(hgh\u22121 ) = \u03bd(g).\nRecall that a group is called bounded if it is bounded with respect to any\nbi-invariant metric. It is easily seen that G is bounded if and only if any\nconjugation-invariant norm on G is bounded.\nLet g \u2208 [G, G]. The commutator length of g, clG (g), is the least integer r\nsuch that g can be expressed by\n(5.1)\n\ng = [h1 , h\u03041 ] . . . [hr , h\u0304r ]\n\nfor some hi , h\u0304i \u2208 G, i = 1, . . . , r. Observe that the commutator length clG is\na conjugation-invariant norm on [G, G]. In particular, if G is a perfect group\nthen clG is a conjugation-invariant norm on G. Then G is called uniformly\nperfect if G = [G, G] and the norm clG is bounded.\nDefinition 5.1. Let G be a subgroup of H(M) and let B be the family of all\nballs and half-balls of M.\n9\n\n\f(1) G is called factorizable (resp. with respect to a cover U \u2282 B) if for any\ng \u2208 G there are d \u2208 N, B1 , . . . , Bd \u2208 B (resp. B1 , . . . , Bd \u2208 U) and\ng1 , . . . , gd \u2208 G such that\n(5.2)\n\ng = g1 . . . gd\n\nwith gi \u2208 GBi\n\nfor all i. Here GB is the subgroup of G of all elements that can be\nconnected to the identity by an isotopy in G compactly supported in\nB.\n(2) Next, a topological group G is continuously factorizable if there exist\nd \u2208 N, B1 , . . . , Bd \u2208 B, and continuous mappings Si : G \u2192 GBi ,\ni = 1, . . . , r, such that for all g \u2208 G\ng = S1 (g) . . . Sd (g).\nProposition 5.2. Under the assumption of Theorem 1.1 on M, the groups\nHc (M) and Hc\u2202 (M) are factorizable with respect to any cover U \u2282 B. The\nsame is true for the isotopy groups PHc (M) and PHc\u2202 (M).\nProof. If M is compact, it follows from Theorem 2.3. If M admits a compact\nexhaustion, the reasoning is similar to that in the proof of 1.1.\n\u0003\nFor any g \u2208 Hc (M), g 6= id, denote by fragM (g) the smallest d such that\n(5.2) holds. By definition fragM (id) = 0. Clearly fragM is a norm on Hc (M).\nLikewise we define fragiso\nM on the isotopy group PHc (M). Clearly fragM (f ) \u2264\niso\nfragM (ft ) if ft is an isotopy connecting f with the identity.\nThe significance of fragM is illustrated by Theorem 1.4.\nDefinition 5.3.\n(1) A topological group G is continuously perfect if there\nexist r \u2208 N and continuous mappings Si : G \u2192 G, S\u0304i : G \u2192 G,\ni = 1, . . . , r, satisfying the equality\n(5.3)\n\ng = [S1 (g), S\u03041(g)] . . . [Sr (g), S\u0304r (g)]\n\nfor all g \u2208 G.\n(2) Let H be a subgroup of G. H is said to be continuously perfect in G if\nthere exist r \u2208 N and continuous mappings Si : H \u2192 G, S\u0304i : H \u2192 G,\ni = 1, . . . , r, satisfying the equality (5.3) for all g \u2208 H. Then rH,G\ndenotes the smallest r as above.\nOf course, every continuously perfect group is uniformly perfect.\nProposition 5.4. Suppose that the closure of B is included in U, where B\nis a ball (or a half-ball and n \u2265 2) and U is open in M. Then HB (M) is\ncontinuously perfect in HU (M) with rHB (M ),HU (M ) = 1.\nProof. It suffices to observe that in the proof of Lemma 3.1 the homomorphism S : HB (M) \u2192 HU (M) is continuous, and the mapping S\u0304 is a constant\ndepending on B and U.\n\u0003\n10\n\n\fThe following fact is a consequence of Prop. 5.4.\nProposition 5.5. If Hc (M) is continuously factorizable then it is also continuously perfect.\nProof. If B1 , . . . , Bd \u2208 B is as in Def. 5.1(2), then choose any open subsets\nU1 , . . . , Ud with B i \u2282 Ui . Then we use Prop. 5.4 to each pair (Bi , Ui ).\n\u0003\nHowever we do not know whether some homeomorphism groups Hc (M)\nare continuously factorizable. See also [21] about locally continuously perfect\ngroups of homeomorphisms.\nBurago, Ivanov and Polterovich proved in the [6] that D(M) is bounded (and\na fortiori uniformly perfect) for many manifolds. We will need some preparatory notions and results from [6]. A subgroup H of G is called strongly mdisplaceable if there is f \u2208 G such that the subgroups H, f Hf \u22121,. . . ,f m Hf \u2212m\npairwise commute. Then we say that f m-displaces H. Fix a conjugationinvariant norm \u03bd on G and assume that H \u2282 G is strongly m-displaceable.\nThen em (H) := inf \u03bd(f ), where f runs over the set of elements of G that\nm-displaces H, is called the order m displacement energy of H.\nTheorem 5.6. [6] Given a group G equipped with a conjugation-invariant\nnorm \u03bd and given H \u2282 G, if there exists g \u2208 G that m-displaces H for every\nm \u2265 1 then for all h \u2208 [H, H]\n(1) clG (h) \u2264 2; and\n(2) \u03bd(h) \u2264 14\u03bd(g).\nIt follows from (1) a weaker version of Lemma 3.1.\nCorollary 5.7. Suppose that B is a ball and B \u2282 U, where U is open. Then\nany homeomorphism supported in B can be written as a product of two commutators of elements of HU (M).\nHowever, contrary to Lemma 3.1, the method based on Theorem 5.6(1) is\nstill true in the smooth category.\n6. Boundedness of Hc (M) and Hc\u2202 (M)\nThe proof of the following theorem is essentially in [6].\nTheorem 6.1. Let B be a ball or a half-ball in M (in the latter case we\nassume n \u2265 2). Then HB (M) is bounded.\nFor the proof we need the following\nProposition 6.2. [6] Suppose that U, V are open disjoint subsets of M such\nthat there is f \u2208 Hc (M) satisfying f (U \u222a V ) \u2282 V . Then f k-displaces HU (M)\nfor all k \u2265 1.\n11\n\n\fProof. Indeed, this follows from the relation f k (U) \u2282 f k\u22121(V ) \\ f k (V ) for all\nk \u2265 1.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 6.1 We can choose an open subset V of M disjoint with B\nand a homeomorphism f \u2208 Hc (M) such that f (B \u222a V ) \u2282 V . In view of Prop.\n6.2 f k-displaces HB (M) for all k. Therefore Theorems 1.1 and 5.7(2) imply\nthe assertion. \u0003\nProof of Theorem 1.4 The part only if is trivial. Conversely, the proof is an\nimmediate consequence of Prop. 5.2 and Theorem 6.1 except for the case\nn = 1 and \u2202M 6= \u2205 (see the proof of 1.5). \u0003\nNow we turn to the proof of Theorem 1.5. Let R+ = [0, \u221e). We begin with\nthe following\nProposition 6.3. For any decreasing sequence in (0,1) of the form\n1 > b1 > a1 > b2 > a2 > . . . > bk > ak > . . . > 0,\nconverging to 0, there exist f1 , f2 \u2208 H(R+ ) such that for k = 1, 2, . . . one has\nf1 ([a2k\u22121 , b2k\u22121 ] \u222a [a2k , b2k ]) \u2282 (a2k , b2k ),\nf2 ([a2k , b2k ] \u222a [a2k+1 , b2k+1 ]) \u2282 (a2k+1 , b2k+1 ).\nMoreover, if we have another sequence\n1 > b\u03031 > \u00e31 > b\u03032 > \u00e32 > . . . > b\u0303k > \u00e3k > . . . > 0,\nthen there is an element of \u03c8 \u2208 H(R+ ) with \u03c8(ak ) = \u00e3k and \u03c8(bk ) = b\u0303k for\nk = 1, 2, . . ..\nProof. In order to prove S\nthe first assertion it suffices to choose f1 (and similarly f2 ) of the form \u03c6 = \u221e\nk=1 \u03c6k with \u03c6k ([a2k\u22121 , b2k\u22121 ] \u222a [a2k , b2k ]) \u2282 (a2k , b2k )\nfor all k and with supp(\u03c6k ) mutually disjoint. The \u03c8 in the second assertion is obtained by gluing together linear homeomorphisms on the consecutive\nintervals [a1 , 1], [b1 , a1 ], and so on.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorems 1.4 (for n = 1 and \u2202M 6= \u2205) and 1.5. Let P = \u2202 \u00d7 [0, 1]\nbe a collar neighborhood embedded in M such that \u2202 identifies with \u2202 \u00d7 {0}.\nSince \u2202 = \u2202M is compact, in view of Theorem 2.5 the restriction mapping\nHc (M) \u220b f 7\u2192 f |\u2202 \u2208 H(\u2202M )\nis an epimorphism. It follows from Lemma 1.10 in [6] that Hc (\u2202M ) is bounded.\nThus it suffices to show the second assertion of Theorem 1.5. Let g \u2208 Hc (\u2202 \u00d7\nR+ ). Arguing as in the proof of Theorem 1.2, there is a sequence, converging\nto 0, of the form\n1 > b1 > b\u03041 > \u01011 > a1 > b2 > . . . > bk > b\u0304k > \u0101k > ak > . . . > 0\n12\n\n\fand homeomorphisms h1 , h2 \u2208 Hc (\u2202 \u00d7 R+ ) such that\nh1 = g on\n\n\u221e\n[\n\n\u2202 \u00d7 [\u01012k\u22121 , b\u03042k\u22121 ],\n\nsupp(h1 ) \u2282 U1 :=\n\nk=1\n\nh2 = g on\n\n\u221e\n[\n\n\u2202 \u00d7 (a2k\u22121 , b2k\u22121 ),\n\n\u221e\n[\n\n\u2202 \u00d7 (a2k , b2k ).\n\nk=1\n\u221e\n[\n\n\u2202 \u00d7 [\u01012k , b\u03042k ],\n\nsupp(h2 ) \u2282 U2 :=\n\nk=1\n\nk=1\n\nContinuing the reasoning from the proof of Theorem 1.2 for h\u2032 = h\u22121 g, it can\nbe checked that g admits a decomposition of the form\ng = h1 h2 h3 h4 ,\nwhere\nh3 = g on\n\nh4 = g on\n\n\u221e\n[\n\n\u2202 \u00d7 (b\u03042k , \u01012k\u22121 ),\n\nk=1\n\n\u221e\n[\n\nk=1\n\n\u221e\n[\n\n\u221e\n[\n\n\u2202 \u00d7 (b\u03042k+1 , \u01012k ),\n\n\u2202 \u00d7 [b2k , a2k\u22121 ],\n\n\u2202 \u00d7 [b2k+1 , a2k ],\n\nsupp(h3 ) \u2282 U3 :=\n\nsupp(h4 ) \u2282 U4 :=\n\nn=0\n\nk=0\n\nand where a0 , \u01010 satisfy 1 > \u01010 > a0 > b1 . Furthermore, hj satisfy conditions\nanalogous to (3.4) for j = 1, 2, 3, 4.\nIn view of Prop. 6.3 there exist f \u0304j \u2208 Hc\u2202 (\u2202 \u00d7 R+ ) of the form f \u0304j = id \u00d7fj\nsuch that HUj (M) is m-displaceable by f \u0304j for j = 1, 2, 3, 4 and for all m \u2265 1.\nLet \u03bd be a conjugation-invariant norm on Hc\u2202 (M). In view of Theorem\n5.6(2) and the invariance of \u03bd we have\n\u03bd(g) \u2264 \u03bd(h1 ) + * * * + \u03bd(h4 ) \u2264 14(\u03bd(f \u03041 ) + * * * \u03bd(f \u03044 )).\nObserve that the sets U1 , . . . , U4 depend on g. Nevertheless, in view of the\nsecond assertion of Prop. 6.3 and the invariance of \u03bd, the norms \u03bd(f \u0304j ) are\nindependent of g. It follows that \u03bd(g) is bounded, as required. \u0003\nDefinition 6.4. A connected open manifold M is called portable (in the wider\nsense) if there are disjoint open subsets U, V of M such that there is f \u2208\nHc (M) with f (U \u222a V ) contained in V . Furthermore, for every compact subset\nK \u2282 M there is h \u2208 Hc (M) satisfying h(K) \u2282 U.\nRemark 6.5. The notion of a portable manifold has been introduced in [6] for\nsmooth open manifolds. The definition there is specific for smooth category\nand a bit stronger than Def. 6.4 (a definition similar to 6.4 is also mentioned\nin [6]).\nThe class of portable manifolds comprises the euclidean spaces Rn , the\nmanifolds of the form M \u00d7 Rn , or the manifolds admitting an exhausting\nMorse function with finite numbers of critical points such that all their indices\n13\n\n\fare less that 12 dim M. In particular, every three-dimensional handlebody is a\nportable manifold.\nTheorem 6.6. If M is portable that Hc (M) is bounded.\nThe proof is a consequence of Prop. 5.2, and is completely analogous to\nthat for diffeomorphisms (Theorem 1.7 in [6]).\nCorollary 6.7. If M o is portable then Hc\u2202 (M) is bounded.\nThe proof follows from Theorems 1.5 and 6.6. In contrast, for diffeomorphism groups we have the following\nProposition 6.8. Let M be a smooth manifold with boundary and let D \u2202 (M)\nbe the subgroup of all f \u2208 D(M) such that there exists a compactly supported\nisotopy ft with f0 = id and f1 = f satisfying ft |\u2202M = id for all t. Then D \u2202 (M)\nis an unbounded group.\nProof. Choose a chart at p \u2208 \u2202M . Then there is the epimorphism\nD \u2202 (M) \u220b f 7\u2192 Jacp (f ) \u2208 R+ ,\nwhere Jacp (f ) is the Jacobian of f at p in this chart. In view of Prop. 1.3\nin [6], an abelian group is bounded if and only if it is finite. Therefore R+ is\nunbounded. Now Lemma 1.10 in [6] implies that D \u2202 (M) is unbounded.\n\u0003\nExample 6.9. Let B\u0304 n+1 \u2282 Rn+1 be the closed ball and S n = \u2202 B\u0304 n+1 . Then\nHc (S n ) is bounded by an argument similar to that of Theorem 1.11(ii) in\n[6] stating that D(S n ) is bounded. Next, Hc (B n+1 ) is bounded in view of\nTheorem 6.6, where B n+1 is the interior of B\u0304 n+1 . Hence, due to Theorem 1.5\nthe group H\u2202 (B\u0304 n+1 ) are bounded.\n7. The universal covering groups of Hc (M) and Hc\u2202 (M)\nLet G be a topological group. The symbol G\u0303 will stand for the universal\ncovering group of G, that is G\u0303 = PG/\u223c , where \u223c denotes the relation of the\nhomotopy relatively endpoints.\nWe introduce the following two operations on the space of paths PG. Let\n\u22c6\nP G = {\u03b3 \u2208 PG : \u03b3(t) = e for t \u2208 [0, 21 ]}. For all \u03b3 \u2208 PG we define \u03b3 \u22c6 as\nfollows:\n\u001a\ne\nf or t \u2208 [0, 12 ]\n\u22c6\n\u03b3 (t) =\n\u03b3(2t \u2212 1) f or t \u2208 [ 21 , 1]\nThen \u03b3 \u22c6 \u2208 P \u22c6 G and the subgroup P \u22c6 G is the image of PG by the mapping\n\u22c6 : \u03b3 7\u2192 \u03b3 \u22c6 . The elements of P \u22c6 G are said to be special paths in G. It\nis important that the group of special paths is preserved by conjugations,\n14\n\n\fi.e. for each g \u2208 PG we have conjg (P \u22c6 G) \u2282 P \u22c6 G for every g \u2208 PG, where\nconjg (h) = ghg \u22121, h \u2208 PG.\nNext, let P \u0003 G = {\u03b3 \u2208 PG : \u03b3(t) = \u03b3(1) for t \u2208 [ 12 , 1]}. For all \u03b3 \u2208 PG\nwe define \u03b3 \u0003 by\n\u001a\n\u03b3(2t) f or t \u2208 [0, 21 ]\n\u0003\n\u03b3 (t) =\n\u03b3(1) f or t \u2208 [ 12 , 1]\nAs before \u03b3 \u0003 \u2208 P \u0003 G and the subgroup P \u0003 G coincides with the image of PG\nby the mapping \u0003 : \u03b3 7\u2192 \u03b3 \u0003 .\nLemma 7.1. For any \u03b3 \u2208 PG we have \u03b3 \u223c \u03b3 \u22c6 and \u03b3 \u223c \u03b3 \u0003 .\nProof. We have to find a homotopy \u0393 rel. endpoints between \u03b3 and \u03b3 \u22c6 . For\nall s \u2208 I define \u0393\u22c6 as follows:\n\u001a\ne\nf or t \u2208 [0, 2s ]\n\u22c6\n\u0393 (t, s) =\n2t\u2212s\n\u03b3( 2\u2212s ) f or t \u2208 ( 2s , 1]\nIt is easy to check that such \u0393\u22c6 fulfils all the requirements.\nFor the second claim define \u0393\u0003 as follows: for any s \u2208 I\n\u001a\n2t\n) f or t \u2208 [0, 2\u2212s\n]\n\u03b3( 2\u2212s\n\u0003\n2\n\u0393 (t, s) =\n,\n1]\n\u03b3(1)\nf or t \u2208 ( 2\u2212s\n2\n\u0003\nGiven a group G recall the definition of homology groups of G. The usual\nconstruction of homology groups proceeds by defining a standard chain complex C(G). Its homology is the homology of G.\nThe complex C(G) is defined as follows. For any integer r \u2265 0 denote\nCr (G)\n\n=\n\nfree abelian group on the set of all r-tuples (g1 , . . . , gr ),\n\nwhere gi \u2208 G. Next introduce the boundary operator \u2202 : Cr (G) \u2192 Cr\u22121 (G)\nby the formula\nr\nX\n\u2202(g1 , . . . , gr ) = (g1\u22121g2 , . . . , g1\u22121 gr ) +\n(\u22121)i (g1 , . . . , g\u02c6i , . . . , gr ).\ni=1\n\n2\n\nThen \u2202 = 0. Let Zr (G) = {c \u2208 Cr (G) : \u2202(c) = 0} and Br (G) = {c \u2208\nCr (G) : (\u2203b \u2208 Cr+1 (G)), \u2202(b) = c}. The symbol Hr (G) = Zr (G)/Br (G) will\nstand for the r-th homology group of the above chain complex. It is well\nknown that\nH1 (G) = G/[G, G],\nthat is, the first homology group is equal to the abelianization of G. For\nany g \u2208 G the conjugation mapping conjg : G \u2192 G induces an identity so\n(conjg )\u22c6 (h) = h for any h \u2208 Hr (G), c.f. [5].\n15\n\n\fForPany g \u2208 PG denote g\u0303 := [g]\u223c \u2208 G\u0303 and for any c \u2208PCr (PG) of the form\nc =\nkj (g1j , . . . , grj ), where kj \u2208 Z, denote by c\u0303 :=\nkj (g\u03031j , . . . , g\u0303rj ) the\ncorresponding element of Cr (G\u0303). Then it is easily checked that\n \u0303 = [\u2202c]\u223c = \u2202c,\ne\n\u2202c\u0303\n\n(7.1)\n\nwhere \u2202 \u0303 is the differential in the chain complex Cr (G\u0303). That is, (7.1) can serve\n \u0303\nas a definition of \u2202.\nP\nIn order to compute Hr (Hc (Rn )\u223c ) we fix notation. Let c = kj (g1j , . . . , grj ),\nwhere kj \u2208 Z, be a chain from Cr (PHc (Rn )). We define the support of c by\n[\nsupp(gij ),\nsupp(c) :=\nS\n\ni,j\n\nwhere supp(g) := t\u2208I supp(gt ), for g : I \u220b t 7\u2192 gt \u2208 Hc (Rn ). Thus supp(c) \u2282\nU iff supp(gij ) \u2282 U for each i, j, or (gij )t \u2208 HU (Rn ) for each i, j, t.\nTheorem 7.2. Let G be either Hc (Rn ), or Hc (Rn+ ) (in the cases Rn+ we assume\nn \u2265 2). For r \u2265 1 one has Hr (G\u0303) = 0. In particular, G\u0303 is a perfect group.\nLet B \u2282 Rn be a ball or B \u2282 Rn+ be a half-ball. By \u03b9 : HB (Rn )\u223c \u2192\nHc (Rn )\u223c we denote the inclusion, and \u03b9\u2217 : Hr (HB (Rn )\u223c ) \u2192 Hr (Hc (Rn )\u223c ) is\nthe corresponding map on the homology level.\nLemma 7.3. \u03b9\u2217 is an isomorphism.\nProof. FirstPwe show that \u03b9\u2217 is surjective. Let h \u2208 Hr (Hc (Rn )\u223c ) and let h = c\u0303,\nwhere c =\nkj (g1j , . . . , grj ) be a cycle representing h. According to Lemma\n7.1 we can assume that gij \u2208 P \u22c6 Hc (Rn ). Then C = supp(c) is compact. We\ncan find \u03c6\u0304 \u2208 PHc (Rn ) such that \u03c6\u03041 (C) \u2286 B. Define \u03c6 := \u03c6\u0304\u0003 \u2208 P \u0003 Hc (Rn ).\nSince any conjugation induces the identity on homology, (conj\u03c6 )\u2217 (h) = h. But,\nin view of (7.1), (conj\u03c6 )\u2217 (h) is represented by the cycle conj\u03c6 (c). It is easily\nseen that for 0 \u2264 t \u2264 21 conj\u03c6 (c)t = id, and for 12 \u2264 t \u2264 1 conj\u03c6 (c)t is\nsupported in B. Hence conj\u03c6 (c) is a the cycle representing homology h\u2032 of the\ngroup HB (Rn )\u223c such that \u03b9\u2217 h\u2032 = h.\nIn order to show injectivity let h \u2208 ker(\u03b9\u2217 ). As above let c be a cycle from P \u22c6 Hc (Rn ) representing h. Since \u03b9\u2217 (h) = 0, there is a cycle c\u2032 \u2208\nCr+1 (PHc (Rn )) such that \u2202c\u2032 = c. In view of Lemma 7.1 we may assume that\nc\u2032 \u2208 Cr+1 (P \u22c6 Hc (Rn )). We choose \u03c6 \u2208 P \u0003 Hc (Rn ) such that \u03c61 (supp(c\u2032 )) \u2286 B.\nWe then have \u2202(conj\u03c6 (c\u2032 )) = conj\u03c6 (\u2202c\u2032 ) = conj\u03c6 (c) = c. This means that c is\nthe boundary of an element from Cr+1 (PHB (Rn )). Consequently, h = 0. \u0003\nProof of Theorem 7.2. (See also [14].) By Lemma 7.3 it suffices to consider\nHB (Rn ) (resp. HB (Rn+ )), where B \u2282 Rn is a ball (resp. B \u2282 Rn+ is a halfball). As in the proof of Lemma 3.1 we define B0 = B and we choose a locally\nfinite, pairwise disjoint sequence of balls (resp. half-balls) (Bk )\u221e\nk=0 converging\n16\n\n\fto a point p \u2208 Rn (resp. p \u2208 \u2202Rn+ ). We also choose an isotopy \u03c6 \u2208 P \u0003 Hc (Rn )\n(resp. \u03c6 \u2208 P \u0003 Hc (Rn+ )) with \u03c61 (Bk ) = Bk+1 for k = 0, 1, . . ..\nNow define \u03c8i : P \u22c6 HB (Rn ) \u2192 P \u22c6 Hc (Rn ) for i = 0, 1 as follows: for each\nclass g \u2208 P \u22c6 HB (Rn ) for each t \u2208 [0, 1] we put:\n\u001a j \u2212j\n\u03c6 g\u03c6 (x) f or x \u2208 S\n\u03c6\u0304j (B), j \u2265 i\n\u03c8i (g)(x) =\nx\nf or x \u2208\n/ j\u2265i \u03c6\u0304j (B)\nIt is obvious that \u03c80 and \u03c81 are conjugate so (\u03c80 )\u2217 = (\u03c81 )\u2217 . Now define\n\u03b7 : P \u22c6 HB (Rn ) \u00d7 P \u22c6 HB (Rn ) \u2192 P \u22c6 H(Rn ) as \u03b7(g, h)(t) = gt \u03c81 (ht ). It is easy to\nprove that \u03b7 induces \u03b7\u0304 : HB (Rn )\u223c \u00d7 HB (Rn )\u223c \u2192 H(Rn )\u223c since if g \u223c \u1e21 and\nh \u223c h\u0304 then also \u03b7(g, h) \u223c \u03b7(\u1e21, h\u0304). Let \u2206 : HB (Rn )\u223c \u2192 HB (Rn )\u223c \u00d7 HB (Rn )\u223c\nbe the diagonal map. Then\n(7.2)\n\n\u03c80 = \u03b7\u2206.\n\nNow we proceed by the induction on r. For r = 0 the assertion is trivial. For\nthe inductive step we may assume that Hs (HB (Rn )\u223c ) = 0 for 1 \u2264 s \u2264 r \u2212 1.\nThen by the Kunneth formula we get\n(7.3)\n\nHr (HB (Rn )\u223c \u00d7 HB (Rn )\u223c ) = Hr (HB (Rn )\u223c ) \u2295 Hr (HB (Rn )\u223c ).\n\nNow choose arbitrarily {c} \u2208 Hr (HB (Rn )\u223c ). Then \u2206\u2217 {c} = {c} \u2295 {c} by\n(7.3). It follows by (7.2) and (7.3) that\n\u03c80\u2217 {c} = \u03b7\u2217 \u2206\u2217 {c} = \u03b9\u2217 {c} + \u03c81\u2217 {c} = \u03b9\u2217 {c} + \u03c80\u2217 {c}.\nThus \u03b9\u2217 {c} = 0, and {c} = 0 by Lemma 7.3, as required. In the case of\nHc (Rn+ ) the proof is the same. \u0003\nProof of Theorem 1.6. The second claim coincides with Theorem 7.2. The first\nclaim is a consequence of Prop. 5.2 for PHc (M), and of the second claim. \u0003\nTheorem 7.4. Let B be a ball or a half-ball in M (in the latter case we\nassume n \u2265 2). Then HB (M)\u223c is bounded.\nProof. Let f \u2208 Hc (M) be as in Prop. 6.2. We choose an isotopy ft \u2208\nP \u0003 Hc (M) joining f with the identity. Next we observe that, due to Theorem\n1.6 and Lemma 7.1 any class from HB (M)\u223c can be represented as a product\nof commutators of elements from P \u2217 HB (M). The proof is now analogous to\nthat of Theorem 6.1.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 1.7. It follows from Prop. 5.2 and Theorem 7.4.\n\n\u0003\n\nReferences\n[1] K. Abe, K.
