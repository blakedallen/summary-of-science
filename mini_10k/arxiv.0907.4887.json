INTRODUCTION\n\n2. MINKOWSKI EQUILIBRIUM VACUUM\n\nThe main cosmological constant problem is to understand why, naturally, the quantum-mechanical zeropoint energy of the vacuum does not produce a large\ncosmological constant or, in other words, to discover\nthe way the zero-point energy is canceled without finetuning the theory. Restricting to established physics,\nthis problem was formulated by Weinberg in the following pragmatic way [1, 2]: how to find an extension of the\nstandard model of elementary particle physics and the\ntheory of general relativity, for which there exists, without fine-tuning, a Minkowski-spacetime solution with\nspacetime-independent fields.\nAn adjustment-type solution of the cosmological\nconstant problem appears, however, to be impossible\nwith a fundamental scalar field and Weinberg writes in\nthe last sentence of Sec. 2 in Ref. [2] that, to the best\nof his knowledge, \"no one has found a way out of this\nimpasse.\" In this Letter, we present a way around the\nimpasse, which employs a quantity q that acts as a selfadjusting scalar field but is non-fundamental [3, 4, 5].\nThe main goal of the present publication is to describe, in a more or less consistent way, a particular\ntheoretical framework for addressing the cosmological\nconstant problem. Obviously, this builds on previous\nwork of the present authors and many others (see citations below). But there are also two important new\nresults, which will be indicated explicitly.\n\nOur discussion starts from the theory outlined in\nRef. [4]. We introduce a special quantity, the vacuum\n\"charge\" q, to describe the statics of the quantum vacuum. A concrete example of this vacuum variable is\ngiven by the four-form field strength [6, 7, 8, 9, 10,\n11, 12, 13, 14] expressed in terms of q as F\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 =\n\u221a\nq \u2212 det g \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 (see below for further details). This\nparticular vacuum variable q is associated with an energy scale EUV that is assumed to be much larger than\nthe electroweak energy scale Eew \u223c 103 GeV and possibly to be of the\n\u221a order of the gravitational energy scale\nEPlanck \u2261 1/ 8\u03c0GN \u2248 2.44 \u00d7 1018 GeV. Here, and in\nthe following, natural units are used with ~ = c = 1.\nSpecifically, the effective action of our theory is given\nby\nZ\n\u0010\np\nd4 x \u2212 det g K(q) R[g]\nS eff [A, g, \u03c8] = \u2212\nR4\n\u0011\n+\u01eb(q) + Leff\n[\u03c8,\ng]\n,\n(1a)\nSM\n\n1)\n\nF\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 \u2261 q \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4\nq2 = \u2212\n\np\n\u2212 det g = \u2207[\u03b1 A\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4] ,\n\n1\nF\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 F \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 ,\n24\n\n(1b)\n(1c)\n\nwhere R denotes the Ricci curvature scalar, \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 the\nLevi\u2013Civita tensor density, \u2207\u03b1 the covariant derivative, and the square bracket around spacetime indices\ncomplete anti-symmetrization. Throughout, we use the\nsame conventions as in Ref. [1], in particular, those for\nthe Riemann curvature tensor and the metric signature\n(\u2212 + ++).\nThe vacuum energy density \u01eb in (1a) depends on the\n\ne-mail: frans.klinkhamer@kit.edu, volovik@boojum.hut.fi\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nF.R. Klinkhamer, G.E.Volovik\n\nvacuum variable q = q[A, g] and the same is assumed to\nhold for the gravitational coupling parameter K. The\nsingle field \u03c8 combines all the fields of the standard\nmodel (spinor, gauge, Higgs, and ghost fields [15]) and,\nfor simplicity, the scalar Lagrange density Leff\nSM in (1a)\nis taken to be without direct q dependence. The original standard model fields collected in \u03c8(x) are quantum fields with vanishing vacuum expectation values\nin Minkowski spacetime (this holds, in particular, for\nthe physical Higgs field H(x) [15]). The effective action\ntakes \u03c8(x) to be a classical field, but has additional\nterms to reflect the quantum effects [16]. The metric\nfield g\u03b1\u03b2 (x) and the three-form gauge field A\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 (x) [or\nother q\u2013related fields discussed later on] are, for the moment, considered to be genuine classical fields.\nThe setup, now, is such that a possible constant term\n\u039bSM in Leff\nSM (which includes the zero-point energies from\nthe standard model fields) has been absorbed in \u01eb(q), so\nthat, in the end, Leff\nSM [\u03c8, g] contains only \u03c8\u2013dependent\nterms, with the metric g\u03b1\u03b2 (or vierbein ea\u03b1 ) entering\nthrough the usual covariant derivatives. In short, the\nfollowing holds true:\nLeff\nSM [\u03c80 , \u03b7] = 0 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c80 denotes the constant values for the standard\nmodel fields over Minkowski spacetime and \u03b7 stands for\nthe Minkowski metric \u03b7\u03b1\u03b2 = diag(\u22121, 1, 1, 1) in standard coordinates.\nThe actual spectrum of the vacuum energy density\n(meaning the different contributions to \u01eb from different energy scales) is not important for the cancellation\nmechanism to be discussed in this Letter. Still, we assume, for definiteness, that the vacuum energy density\n\u01eb(q) splits into a constant part and a variable part:\n\u01eb(q) = \u039bbare + \u01ebvar (q) \u2261 \u039bSM + \u039bUV + \u01ebvar (q) ,\n\n(3)\n\nwith \u2202\u01ebvar /\u2202q 6= 0, a constant term \u039bSM of typical size\n|\u039bSM | \u223c (Eew )4 removed from Leff\nSM according to (2),\nand a possible extra contribution \u039bUV of size |\u039bUV | \u223c\n(EUV )4 from the unknown physics beyond the standard\nmodel. For definiteness, we also assume that \u01ebvar (q) contains only even powers of q and recall that q 2 is defined\nby (1c) in terms of the three-form gauge field A entering the field strength (1b). Allowing for a general even\nfunction \u01eb(q) instead of the single Maxwell-type term\n1 2\n2 q considered in the previous literature [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nwill turn out to be an important ingredient for the cancellation of \u039bbare values of arbitrary sign.\nThe generalized Maxwell and Einstein equations\n\nfrom action (1a) have been derived in Ref. [4]. The\ngeneralized Maxwell equation reads\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0013\np\n\u2202K(q)\nF \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 \u2202\u01eb(q)\n= 0 (4)\n\u2207\u03b1\n+R\n\u2212 det g\nq\n\u2202q\n\u2202q\n\nand reproduces the known equation [6, 7] for the special\ncase \u01eb(q) = 21 q 2 and \u2202K/\u2202q = 0. The first integral of\n(4) with integration constant \u03bc and the final version of\nthe generalized Einstein equation then give the following generic equations [4]:\n\u2202\u01eb(q)\n\u2202K(q)\n+R\n= \u03bc,\n(5a)\n\u2202q\n\u2202q\n\u0001\n\u0001\n2K R\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 g \u03b1\u03b2 R/2 = \u22122 \u2207\u03b1 \u2207\u03b2 \u2212 g \u03b1\u03b2 \u0003 K(q)\n\u0001\n\u03b1\u03b2\n+ \u01eb(q) \u2212 \u03bc q g \u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 TSM\n, (5b)\n\n\u03b1\u03b2\nwhere TSM\nis the energy-momentum tensor corresponding to the effective Lagrangian appearing in (1a) and\n(2). From general coordinate invariance, the energymomentum tensor is known to have a vanishing covari\u03b1\u03b2\nant divergence, \u2207\u03b1 TSM\n= 0.\nFor the special case K(q) = K0 = const, (5b) reduces to the standard Einstein equation of general relativity. For the general case dK/dq 6= 0, the action\n(1a) and the resulting field equation (5b) correspond\nto those of Brans\u2013Dicke theory [17], but without kinetic term for the scalar degree of freedom (\u03c9BD = 0).\nSee also the related work on inflation theory [18], darkenergy models [19, 20, 21, 22], and the connection to\nq\u2013theory [23, 24, 25].\nThe crucial difference between our theory and conventional f (R) modified-gravity theories [18, 19, 20, 21,\n22] lies in the appearance, for us, of the integration constant \u03bc after integration over the three-form gauge field\nA, i.e., after solving the generalized Maxwell equation\n(4). As a result, the vacuum energy density entering\nthe generalized Einstein equation (5b) is not the original vacuum energy density \u01eb(q) from the action (1a) but\nthe combination\n\n\u03c1V (q) \u2261 \u01eb(q) \u2212 \u03bc q .\n\n(6)\n\nThis gravitating vacuum energy density becomes a genuine cosmological constant \u039b \u2261 \u039b(q) = \u03c1V (q) for a\nspacetime-independent vacuum variable q.\nThe field equations (5ab) can now be seen to have\na Minkowski-type solution with spacetime-independent\nfields. For standard global spacetime coordinates, the\nfields of this constant solution are given by\ng\u03b1\u03b2 (x) = \u03b7\u03b1\u03b2 ,\n\n(7a)\n\nF\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 (x) = q0 \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 ,\n\n(7b)\n\n\u03c8(x) = \u03c80 ,\n\n(7c)\n\n\fTowards a solution of the cosmological constant problem\n\n3\n\nwith spacetime-independent parameters \u03bc0 and q0 determined by the following two conditions:\n#\n\"\nd\u01eb(q)\n\u2212\u03bc\n= 0,\n(8a)\ndq\n\u03bc=\u03bc0 , q=q0\n\nh\n\n\u01eb(q) \u2212 \u03bc q\n\ni\n\n\u03bc=\u03bc0 , q=q0\n\n= 0.\n\n(8b)\n\nConditions (8a) and (8b) follow from (5a) and (5b), re\u03b1\u03b2\nspectively, for R = R\u03b1\u03b2 = TSM\n= 0 and spacetimeindependent q0 .\nThe two conditions (8a)\u2013(8b) can be combined into\na single equilibrium condition for q0 :\n\"\n#\nd\u01eb(q)\n\u039b0 \u2261 \u01eb(q) \u2212 q\n= 0,\n(9)\ndq\nq=q0\n\nwith the derived quantity [26]\n#\n\"\nd\u01eb(q)\n\u03bc0 =\ndq\n\n.\n\n(10)\n\nq=q0\n\nThe spacetime independence of q0 implies that of \u03bc0\nin (10) and, with (5a), guarantees that the generalized Maxwell equation (4) is automatically solved by\nthe Minkowski-type solution (7); see below for a general discussion of this important point. In order for\nthe Minkowski vacuum to be stable, there is the further\ncondition:\n#\n\"\n2\n\u0001\u22121\n2 d \u01eb(q)\n> 0,\n(11)\n\u2261 q\n\u03c70\ndq 2\nq=q0\n\nwhere \u03c7 corresponds to the isothermal vacuum compressibility [3]. In the equilibrium vacuum relevant to\nour Universe, the gravitational constant K(q0 ) of \u0001the\naction (1a) can be identified with K0 \u2261 1/ 16\u03c0 GN in\nterms of Newton's constant GN .\nEquation (9) corresponds to the first of the two\nconstant-field equilibrium conditions given by Weinberg [1] as Eqs. (6.2) and (6.3): \u2202L/\u2202g\u03b1\u03b2 = 0 and\n\u2202L/\u2202\u03c6 = 0, having restricted the discussion here to\nthe case of a single fundamental scalar field \u03c6. These\ntwo conditions turn out to be inconsistent, unless the\npotential term in L(\u03c6) is fine-tuned [1]. See also Sec. 2\nof Ref. [2] for further discussion on the impossibility of\nfinding a natural Minkowski-type solution from the adjustment of a fundamental scalar field.\nThe crucial difference between a fundamental scalar\nfield \u03c6 and our vacuum variable q (a non-fundamental\nscalar field) is that the equilibrium condition for q is\nrelaxed : we find, instead of the condition \u2202L/\u2202q = 0,\n\nFig. 1 Minkowski equilibrium vacua for a particular\nchoice of the vacuum energy density function as given\nby (12). The curves of the top panel show the lefthand side of (13a) for those values of x \u2261 qb 2 that obey\nthe stability condition (13b). The curves of the bottom\npanel show the corresponding positive segments of the\ninverse of the dimensionless vacuum compressibility \u03c7\nb\ndefined by the left-hand side of (13b), the general dimensional quantity being defined by (11). Minkowskitype vacua (7) are obtained at the intersection points of\nthe curves of the top panel with a horizontal line at the\nvalue \u03bb \u2261 \u039bbare /(EUV )4 [for example, the dashed line\nat \u03bb = 10 gives the value (b\nq0 )2 \u2248 17.8453 corresponding\nto the heavy dot in the top panel]. Each such vacuum is\ncharacterized, in part, by the corresponding value of the\ninverse vacuum compressibility from the bottom panel\n[for example, 1/b\n\u03c70 \u2248 546.974 shown by the heavy dot\nfor the case chosen in the top panel]. Minkowski vacua\nwith positive compressibility are stable and become attractors in a dynamical context (cf. Sec. 3 and Fig. 2).\n\nthe conditions \u2207\u03b1 (\u2202L/\u2202q) = 0, which allow for having\n\u2202L/\u2202q = \u03bc with an arbitrary constant \u03bc. As a result,\nthe equilibrium conditions for g\u03b1\u03b2 and q can be consistent without fine-tuning. The approach based on such\na q\u2013variable bypasses the apparent no-go theorem (as\nforetold by Ftn. 8 of Ref. [1]) and formally solves the\ncosmological constant problem (as formulated in Sec. 2\nof Ref [2]): the original action is not fine-tuned and\n\n\f4\n\nF.R. Klinkhamer, G.E.Volovik\n\nneed not vanish at the stationary point, but there still\nexists a Minkowski-type solution of the field equations.\nThis realization that the q\u2013field allows for a relaxation\nof the equilibrium condition is the first of the two most\nimportant new results of the present Letter.\nThe Minkowski-type solution of theory (1) is given\nby the fields (7) with a constant q0 parameter that solves\n(9) and satisfies (11). At this moment, it may be instructive to work out a concrete example. A particular choice for the vacuum energy density function (3) is\ngiven by:\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u01eb(q) = \u039bbare + (1/2) (EUV )4 sin q 2 /(EUV )4 , (12)\n\nwhich contains higher-order terms in addition to the\nstandard quadratic term 21 q 2 . Needless to say, many\nother functions \u01eb(q) can be chosen, the only requirement\nbeing that the equilibrium and stability conditions can\nbe satisfied [3]. With (12), the expressions for the equilibrium condition (9) and the stability condition (11)\nbecome\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(13a)\nqb 2 cos qb 2 \u2212 (1/2) sin qb 2 = \u03bb ,\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03c7\nb \u22121 \u2261 qb 2 cos qb 2 \u2212 2 qb 4 sin qb 2 > 0 ,\n\n(13b)\n\nwhere EUV has been used to define dimensionless quantities qb \u2261 q/(EUV )2 and \u03bb \u2261 \u039bbare /(EUV )4 . A straightforward graphical analysis (Fig. 1) shows that, for any\n\u03bb \u2208 R, there are infinitely many values qb0 \u2208 R which\nobey both (13a) and (13b). The top panel of Fig. 1 also\nshows that the qb values on the one segment singledout by the heavy dot already allow for a complete cancellation of any \u039bbare value between \u221215 (EUV )4 and\n+18 (EUV )4 .\n3. MINKOWSKI ATTRACTOR\n\nThe cancellation mechanism discussed in the previous section provides the following general lesson.\nThe Minkowski-type solution (7) appears without finetuning of the parameters of the action, precisely because\nthe vacuum is characterized by a constant derivative\nof the vacuum field rather than by a constant value of\nthe vacuum field itself. As a result, the parameter \u03bc0\nemerges in (8a) as an integration constant, i.e., as a parameter of the solution rather than a parameter of the\nLagrangian. The idea that the constant derivative of\na field may be important for the cosmological constant\nproblem has been suggested earlier by Dolgov [27, 28]\nand Polyakov [29, 30], where the latter explored the\nanalogy with the Larkin\u2013Pikin effect [31] in solid-state\nphysics.\n\nHowever, instead of the fine-tuning problem of the\ncosmological constant, we now have the fine-tuning\nproblem of the integration constant, namely, the chemical potential \u03bc = \u03bc0 that fixes the value q = q0 of the\nMinkowski equilibrium vacuum (or vice versa, q0 fixing \u03bc0 ). Any other choice of the integration constant\n(\u03bc 6= \u03bc0 ) leads to a de-Sitter-type solution [4]. Still, it\nis possible to show that these de-Sitter-type solutions\nbecome dynamically unstable in a generalization of q\u2013\ntheory and that the Minkowski equilibrium vacuum becomes an attractor.\nFor that purpose, we start from the realization of q\u2013\ntheory in terms of a vector field A\u03b2 (x) as discussed by\nDolgov [28] or, equivalently, in terms of an aether-type\nvelocity field u\u03b2 (x) as discussed by Jacobson [32]. The\nconstant vacuum field q then appears [3] as the derivative of a vector field in the specific solution u\u03b2 = u\u03b2 corresponding to the equilibrium vacuum, q g\u03b1\u03b2 \u2261 \u2207\u03b1 u\u03b2 \u2261\nu\u03b1\u03b2 . In this realization, the effective chemical potential\n\u03bc \u2261 d\u01eb(q)/dq plays a role only for the equilibrium states\n(i.e., for their thermodynamical properties), but \u03bc does\nnot appear as an integration constant for the dynamics.\nHence, the fine-tuning problem of the integration constant is overcome, simply because there is no integration\nconstant.\nThe instability of the de-Sitter solution has been\ndemonstrated by Dolgov [28] for the simplest quadratic\nchoices of the Lagrange density of u\u03b2 (x) and for an energy scale EUV = EPlanck entering \u039bbare of (3). (At this\nmoment, we do not consider the possibility of having a\nvariable gravitational coupling parameter, so that we set\nK[u\u03b1\u03b2 ] = K0 = const.) For a spatially flat Robertson\u2013\nWalker metric with cosmic time t and scale factor\na(t), the initial de-Sitter-type universe evolves towards\nMinkowski spacetime by the following t \u2192 \u221e asymptotic solution for the aether-type field u\u03b2 = (u0 , ub ) and\nthe Hubble parameter H \u2261 [da/dt]/a:\nu0 (t) \u2192 q0 t ,\n\nub (t) = 0 ,\n\nH(t) \u2192 1/t ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere u0 (t) increases linearly with t for constant q0 (the\nnorm of the vector field u\u03b2 is taken [3] to be unconstrained, different from Ref. [32]). Figure 2 shows explicitly the attractor behavior, with the numerical value\nof q0 in (14) appearing dynamically.\nThe following three remarks may help to better understand the role of (14). First, observe that, for finite\nvalues of t, the aether-type field approaching (14) does\nnot correspond to the q\u2013theory Ansatz, u\u03b1\u03b2 \u2261 \u2207\u03b1 u\u03b2 6=\nq g\u03b1\u03b2 for t < \u221e. Second, the fact that H(t) in (14)\nand Figure 2 drops to zero means that the Robertson\u2013\nWalker metric approaches the one of Minkowski space-\n\n\fTowards a solution of the cosmological constant problem\n\n5\n\ntime, whereas, for a positive asymptotic value of H(t),\nthe metric would have approached the one of de-Sitter\nspacetime. Third, the simple model with solution\n(14) does not appear to give a realistic description of\nthe present Universe [33] and requires an appropriate\nmodification (possibly implementing chameleon-type effects [34]), but, for the present discussion, the simple\nmodel suffices.\nIt is straightforward to show that the asymptotic\nsolution (14) also holds for the generalized Lagrangian\nwith a generic function \u01eb(u\u03b1\u03b2 ) replacing the quadratic\nterm, as discussed in Sec. V D of Ref. [3]. At large cosmic times t, the curvature terms decay as |R| \u223c H 2 \u223c\n1/t2 and the Einstein equations lead to the nullification of the energy-momentum tensor of the u\u03b2 field:\nT\u03b1\u03b2 [u] = 0. Since the exact expressions on the righthand-sides of (14) with du0 /dt = H u0 satisfy the q\u2013\ntheory Ansatz u\u03b1\u03b2 = q g\u03b1\u03b2 , the energy-momentum tensor is completely expressed by the single constant q:\nT\u03b1\u03b2 (q) = [\u01eb(q) \u2212 q d\u01eb(q)/dq] g\u03b1\u03b2 . As a result, the equation T\u03b1\u03b2 (q) = 0 leads to the equilibrium condition (9)\nfor the Minkowski vacuum and to the equilibrium value\nq = q0 in (14). This demonstrates that the compensation of a large initial vacuum energy density can occur\ndynamically and that Minkowski spacetime can emerge\nspontaneously, without setting a chemical potential. In\nother words, an \"existence proof\" has been given for the\nconjecture that the appropriate Minkowski value q0 can\nresult from an attractor-type solution of the field equations. The only condition for the Minkowski vacuum\nto be an attractor is a positive vacuum compressibility\n(11). This existence proof is the second of the two most\nimportant new results of the present Letter.\nIn the previous discussion, we illustrated the compensation of the \"bare\" vacuum energy density by use\nof the simplest realizations of the constant vacuum field\nq, where q follows from derivatives of either the fundamental gauge field A\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 (x) or the fundamental vector\nfield u\u03b2 (x). The constant vacuum field q from the fourform field strength tensor (1b) has been discussed earlier in, e.g., Refs. [9, 10]. But these references consider\na quadratic function \u01eb(F ), which can only compensate a\n\u039bbare value of a particular sign. Our approach is generic\nand does not depend on the particular realization of\nthe \"quinta essentia\" - the field q which describes the\ndeep (ultraviolet) quantum vacuum [35]. The only requirement for q is that it must be a Lorentz-invariant\nconserved (i.e., spacetime-independent) quantity in flat\nMinkowski spacetime. In addition, an almost arbitrary\nfunction \u01eb(q) allows for the cancellation of \u039bbare values\n\nFig. 2 Aether-field evolution and Minkowski attractor in a spatially flat Friedmann\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker\nuniverse with \u03bb \u2261 \u039bbare /(EPlanck )4 = 2.\nTop\npanel: dimensionless aether-type field component v \u2261\nu0 /EPlanck [multiplied by a factor \u03c4 \u22121 ] plotted against\nthe logarithm of the dimensionless cosmic time y \u2261\nlog 10 \u03c4 \u2261 log10 (t EPlanck ). Bottom panel: dimensionless Hubble parameter h \u2261 H/EPlanck [multiplied by a\nfactor \u03c4 ] plotted against y. The field equations are given\nby Eqs. (5) and (8) in Ref. [28] for \u03c1vac = \u039bbare and \u03b70 =\n\u22121: v\u0308 +3 h v\u0307 \u22123 h2 v = 0 and 6 h2 = 2 \u03bb\u2212(v\u0307)2 \u22123 (h v)2 ,\nwith the overdot standing for differentiation with respect to \u03c4 . The four numerical solutions shown have\nboundary conditions v(1) = 1 \u00b1 0.25 and v\u0307(1) = \u00b10.25,\nwith the dashed curves referring to negative v\u0307(1) [note\nthat the top panel plots v(\u03c4 )/\u03c4 , not v(\u03c4 )]. All four\nnumerical solutions approach the Minkowski-spacetime\nsolution (14) with, for the chosen model parameter\n\u039bbare /(EPlanck )4 = 2, a value q0 /(EPlanck )2 = 1 appearing dynamically [see top panel]. In fact, the same\nt \u2192 \u221e asymptote is found for all boundary conditions |v(1) \u2212 1| \u2264 0.25 and |v\u0307(1)| \u2264 0.25, which shows\nthat (14) is a positive attractor. For the theory considered [defined by Eq. (2) of Ref. [28] for \u03b70 = \u22121], the\nMinkowski vacuum is an attractor because the vacuum\ncompressibility (11) is positive, \u03c7(q0 ) > 0.\n\nof both signs; see, in particular, the example (12) discussed above.\n\n\f6\n\nF.R. Klinkhamer, G.E.Volovik\n\nFinally, it may be of interest to compare our possible solution of the cosmological constant problem with\nthat of the unimodular theory of gravity (see, e.g.,\nRefs. [1, 37, 38] and further references therein). From\nthe unimodular theory of gravity, the cosmological constant of standard general relativity is obtained as an\nintegration constant and the Minkowski solution also\nfollows without fine-tuning of the parameters of the action. As a purely classical theory, unimodular gravity\nis equivalent to general relativity, but its extension to\nthe quantum world can be expected to be different from\nthat of general relativity, which is at the core of our approach [the q dependence of the gravitational coupling\nK in action (1a) is not essential to obtain (9) and the\nparticular aether-type solution discussed in the present\nsection already has constant K]. Furthermore, the unimodular gravity theory would not allow for a spacetimedependent \"cosmological constant\" and, a forteriori,\nwould not give an attractor-type solution approaching\nMinkowski spacetime.\n\n4. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK\n\nIn this Letter, we have shown that it is possible\nto find an extension of the current theory of elementary particle physics (the standard model), which allows for a Minkowski-spacetime solution with constant\nfields, without fine-tuning the extended theory in any\nway or shape. For this suggested solution, the cosmological constant \u039bbare from (3), which includes the zeropoint energy \u039bSM \u223c \u00b1 (Eew )4 of the standard model\nfields, is completely compensated by the q\u2013field that\ndescribes the degrees of freedom of the deep quantum\nvacuum with energy scale EUV \u226b Eew .\nThis solves the main cosmological constant problem [39] and even addresses the next question (also\nraised in Ref. [1]): why is our present Universe close\nto the Minkowski vacuum or, in other words, why does\nNature prefer flat spacetime? The answer to this question appears to be: because the Minkowski equilibrium\nstate is an attractor and the Universe is moving towards\nit. We are close to this attractor, simply because our\nUniverse is old.\nThere remain, however, other problems. Observational cosmology (see, e.g., Refs. [40, 41, 42] and further references therein) suggests a tiny remnant vacuum energy density \u03c1V of the order of 10\u221211 eV4 . This,\nthen, leads to the additional cosmic coincidence problem: why is the nonzero vacuum energy density of the\nsame order as the present matter energy density? One\npossible solution [5] of the cosmic coincidence problem\n\nmay be related to quantum-dissipative effects during the\ncosmological evolution of the microscopic field q(x). In\nany case, q\u2013theory transforms the standard cosmological\nconstant problem into the search for the proper decay\nmechanism of the vacuum energy density.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nIt is a pleasure to thank A.
