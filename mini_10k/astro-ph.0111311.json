Without reliable corrections for\nthe effects of mass segregation, hence for the structure and\ndynamical evolution of the cluster, it is impossible to obtain\nan accurate estimate of the IMF from the observational LF.\nIn this paper, we will concentrate on the analysis of the\nbehaviour of the stellar LF of two young Large Magellanic\nCloud (LMC) star clusters as a function of radius; in a companion paper (de Grijs et al. 2001, Paper II), we will derive\nthe associated mass functions (MFs) and discuss in detail\nhow this transformation depends on the assumed models.\nFinally, in a forthcoming paper (de Grijs et al., in prep.,\nPaper III), we will extend our analysis to our larger LMC\ncluster sample, spanning a significant age range, in which\nwe will attempt to model the dynamical cluster evolution.\nAlthough the standard picture, in which stars in dense\nclusters evolve rapidly towards a state of energy equipartition through stellar encounters, with the corresponding mass\nsegregation, is generally accepted, observations of various\n\n\f2\n\nR. de Grijs et al.\n\ndegrees of mass segregation in very young star clusters (e.g.,\nHillenbrand 1997, Testi et al. 1997, Fischer et al. 1998, Hillenbrand & Hartmann 1998, Hillenbrand & Carpenter 2000)\nsuggest that at least some of this effect is related to the process of star and star cluster formation itself (cf. Paper II):\nthese clusters are often significantly younger than their twobody relaxation time (even the equivalent relaxation time\nin the core), the time scale on which dynamical mass segregation should occur. Quantifying the degree of actual mass\nsegregation is thus crucial for the interpretation of observational LFs in terms of the IMF, even for very young star\nclusters.\nAlthough dynamical two-body relaxation effects tend to\nsegregate a cluster's mass distribution roughly on its mean\nrelaxation time scale, possibly enhanced by some degree of\nprimordial mass segregation, the observability of mass segregation depends on a number of conditions. These are mostly\ninterrelated and include, among others, the cluster's degree\nof central concentration, its age, the radial range sampled by\nthe observations and, most of all, the observer's ability to resolve the individual cluster stars towards the cluster centre.\nHubble Space Telescope (HST) observations show, almost\nwithout exception, mass segregation effects in old Galactic GCs, in rich, compact Magellanic Cloud clusters, and in\nyoung star clusters still embedded in molecular clouds, although to varying degrees. Not surprisingly, the fraction of\nground-based observations reporting the detection of mass\nsegregation effects, sometimes even in the same objects, is\nsignificantly lower. We will now briefly discuss the observational evidence for mass segregation in the youngest star\nclusters.\n1.1\n\nRich Compact Magellanic Cloud Clusters\n\nSince the rich, compact star clusters in the Magellanic\nClouds span a wide range of ages, from \u223c 106 to \u223c 1.3\u00d71010\nyr (cf. Elson & Fall 1988), observable effects of mass segregation due to two-body relaxation need not be expected a\npriori, particularly for the youngest clusters. Ground-based\nobservations may be severely hampered by crowding in the\ncluster cores, thus hiding possible signatures of dynamical,\nas well as primordial, mass segregation. This is likely the case\nin a number of the young star clusters in the LMC studied\nby Elson, Fall & Freeman (1987) and Subramaniam, Sagar\n& Bhatt (1993), although the uncertainties in the power-law\nslopes of the MFs derived by Elson et al. (1987), down to a\ngiven limiting brightness, are large and could possibly hide\nmass segregation signatures.\nThe quality of ground-based data for rich LMC clusters\noften allows only marginal confirmation of possible mass segregation effects, especially in young clusters if based on LF\ndifferences as a function of cluster radius (e.g., NGC 1711,\nSubramaniam et al. 1993; NGC 1866, Elson et al. 1987).\nSimilarly, ground-based observations of H4 (Mateo & Hodge\n1986), LW 79 (Mateo & Hodge 1987), and ESO121-SC09\n(Mateo, Hodge & Schommer 1986, Papenhausen & Schommer 1988) report either no convincing (LW 79) or marginal\nevidence for mass segregation based on the distributions of\nmain-sequence and giant-branch stars, due to small-number\nstatistics in the cluster cores.\nIn all other LMC clusters studied for this purpose to\ndate, using either LFs or their associated MFs as a func-\n\ntion of radius to assess the distributions of stars of varying brightness (mass), ground-based observations (e.g., NGC\n2100, Westerlund 1961; NGC 2098 and SL 666, Kontizas et\nal. 1998) do indeed show strong indications of mass segregation. In addition, observations with the HST have also\nresulted in convincing cases for mass segregation, e.g., in all\nobjects in our own LMC cluster sample (cf. Elson et al. 1999\nfor NGC 1868, and Santiago et al. 2001; hereafter SBJG),\nin NGC 2157 (Fischer et al. 1998), and in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) star cluster NGC 330 (Sirianni et al.\n2001). The results of SBJG were based on a first, preliminary\nanalysis of the WFPC2 observations also used in this paper.\nHere, we present a more detailed analysis of the effects of\nluminosity segregation in the two youngest clusters in our\nLMC sample, while combining the WFPC2 data with the\nSTIS observations also obtained as part of the same programme (cf. Section 2), and with wide-field ground-based\nobservations obtained with the NTT.\nWe note that for one of the objects in our sample, NGC\n1818, contradicting results have been obtained: Hunter et\nal. (1997) did not find evidence for mass segregation in this\ncluster for stellar masses in the range 0.85 \u2264 m \u2264 9M\u2299 ,\nwith the proviso that the cluster core does contain brighter\nstars that were not included in their study due to saturation,\nwhereas the outer regions do not. Recently, however, SBJG\nconfirmed significant mass segregation, based on the radial\nvariance of the cluster LFs. Elson et al. (1998) adopted a\ndifferent approach, and concluded that the fraction of binary stars increases significantly from \u223c 20% in the outer\nregions to \u223c 35% in the core. This is consistent with expectations from (i) dynamical mass segregation, where we\nmight expect the more massive binaries to have undergone\nsubstantial two-body relaxation while single stars would not\nhave (cf. Paper II), and (ii) the radial dependence of the\nbinary creation and destruction rates in these young star\nclusters. Elson et al. (1998) show that their derived IMF is\nfully consistent with Hunter et al.'s (1997) results.\n1.2\n\nVery Young Star Clusters\n\nThe study of proto-stellar clusters, i.e., very young associations of stars still embedded in the molecular clouds from\nwhich they originated, might give us a handle to constrain\nthe degree of primordial mass segregation. In the Galaxy,\nin three such young star clusters (YSCs) mass segregation\neffects have been studied in detail in the past decade.\nGround-based observations of both NGC 2024 (Lada\net al. 1991, Carpenter et al. 1997) and the Monoceros R2\n(MonR2) complex (Carpenter et al. 1997) have not been\nable to show the presence or absence of (possibly primordial) mass segregation convincingly. While Lada et al. (1991)\nsuggested that the brighter stars in NGC 2024 seem to be\nmore centrally concentrated than the fainter cluster members, this evidence was deemed inconclusive by Carpenter\net al. (1997). They argued that this result was based on an\nincomplete sample of cluster stars, although mass segregation might be limited to the OB stars forming in the very\ncentre. These same authors argued that for masses below\n2M\u2299 , mass segregation effects in MonR2 amount to only\na \u223c 2\u03c3 result, although the most massive star (\u223c 10M\u2299 )\nappears to be forming near the cluster centre, where their\nextinction-limited sample of cluster stars does not reach.\nc 2001 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fMass segregation in young LMC clusters I.\nA combination of both ground-based (e.g., Hillenbrand\n1997) and HST observations (e.g., Hillenbrand & Hartmann\n1998) of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), and in particular\nof its very core, the Trapezium stars, have presented clear\nevidence for mass segregation for the m > 5M\u2299 component,\nwith some evidence for general mass segregation down to\nm \u2243 1\u20132M\u2299 (Hillenbrand & Hartmann 1998, see also the\nreview by Larson 1993). Mass segregation in this YSC has,\nin fact, been known for more than 5 decades, as pointed out\nby Hillenbrand & Hartmann (1998).\nFinally, R136, the central cluster in the actively starforming 30 Doradus region in the LMC (age . 3\u20134 Myr,\ncf. Hunter et al. 1995), has been studied extensively, both\nfrom the ground and with HST. A variety of techniques\nhave revealed a significant overabundance of high-mass stars\nin its very centre, and thus strong mass segregation (e.g.,\nCampbell et al. 1992, Larson 1993, Malumuth & Heap 1994,\nBrandl et al. 1996). Hunter et al. (1995) constrained the central region in which possible mass segregation effects were\nobserved to r . 0.5 pc, and found little evidence of mass\nsegregation beyond this radius for stars in the mass range\n2.8 \u2264 m \u2264 15M\u2299 . However, they reported a hint of an excess of bright stars within 0.5 pc, and a deficit of the highestmass stars in the annulus 0.6 \u2264 r \u2264 1.2 pc, which would be\nconsistent with expectations for mass segregation. Brandl,\nChernoff & Moffat (2001), finally, present very interesting\nevidence for the ejection of a fair number of massive stars\nfrom the core, due to two-body encounters, which could not,\nwith higher confidence, be attributed to alternative scenarios.\nThus, in most of the young compact star clusters that\ncan be resolved in individual stars by currently available\ntelescopes, mass segregation effects are observed, although\nto varying degrees. This underlines the importance of our\nunderstanding of the physical processes involved in the formation and evolution of star clusters, and in particular of the\nIMF, which will ultimately determine whether a young star\ncluster will eventually be destroyed or evolve to a Galactic\nGC-type object.\nBecause of their large range in ages, rich compact star\nclusters in the LMC are ideal candidates to assess the effects and magnitude of dynamical mass segregation, provided that one can constrain the degree of primordial mass\nsegregation to within reasonable uncertainties. Constraining\nthis degree of primordial mass segregation is of crucial importance to discriminate among different theories of star formation in clusters, which generally depend on the presence\nof extensive dissipation processes. The presence or absence\nof dissipation during the star formation process may have\nsignificantly different effects on the radial dependence of the\nIMF (cf. Fischer et al. 1998).\n\n2\n\nTHE LMC CLUSTER SAMPLE\n\nIn this paper, we will focus on the two youngest LMC star\nclusters in our sample, NGC 1805 and NGC 1818.

Paper II)\nand the observer's ability to resolve individual stars, in particular in its core. Due to crowding, the observations in the\ncore need to be of high resolution.\n(ii) Since the initial mass of stars at the main sequence\nturn-off magnitude and the mass of stars on the giant and\nhorizontal branches is approximately constant, we will need\nto obtain deep observations, extending well down the main\nsequence, in order to sample a sufficiently large mass range.\nIn fact, as Bolte (1989) argued, since the dynamical relaxation time scale for the cluster stars, with the exception of\nthose in the very core, is long compared to the time scale for\nmass loss between the main sequence and horizontal branch,\nwe can in principle extend our analysis to include stars from\nthe horizontal branch down to the completeness limit of the\nmain sequence.\nAs part of HST GO programme 7307, we obtained\nWFPC2 and STIS imaging observations of the populous\nLMC clusters in Table 1. The high resolution of the\nWFPC2/PC observations (\u223c 1.8 pixels; the pixel size of the\nWF chips is 0.097\u2032\u2032 , with a total combined field of view of\nroughly 4850 arcsec2 for the entire WFPC2 detector, while\nthe PC pixel size is 0.0455\u2032\u2032 ) meets the first condition above,\nwhile the deep STIS data allow for the construction of very\ndeep LFs down to \u223c 0.2M\u2299 ; in fact, STIS (in imaging mode\nthrough long-pass [LP] filters) is five times more sensitive\nfor faint red objects than WFPC2.\nAlthough parts of the observations of the LMC clusters have been described elsewhere already (e.g., Beaulieu\n\n\f4\n\nR. de Grijs et al.\n\net al. 1999, Elson et al. 1999, Castro et al. 2001, Johnson\net al. 2001, SBJG), here we will give a brief overview of\nthe available data for the two youngest star clusters in our\nsample. This paper builds on the preparatory research by\nSBJG, which we will continue in significantly greater detail;\ncolour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of these clusters were\npublished by Johnson et al. (2001). These latter authors focused predominantly on the brighter stars in NGC 1805 and\nNGC 1818 to consider ages and age ranges. In this study\nwe include the entire range of magnitudes down to the 50%\ncompleteness limit (Sec. 2.6) to consider the evidence for\nluminosity and mass segregation in these clusters.\n\n2.1.1\n\nWFPC2 observations\n\nWe obtained WFPC2 exposures through the F555W and\nF814W filters (roughly corresponding to the JohnsonCousins V and I filters, resp.) for each cluster, with the PC\ncentred on both the cluster centre, and on its half-mass radius. Following SBJG, we will refer to these two sets of exposures as our CEN and HALF fields, respectively. For the\nCEN fields, we obtained both deep (exposure times of 140s\nand 300s, respectively, for each individual image in F555W\nand F814W) and shallow (exposure times of 5s and 20s were\nused for the F555W and F814W filters, respectively) images. The shallow exposures were intended to obtain aperture photometry for the brightest stars in the cluster centres,\nwhich are saturated in the deeper exposures. At each position, for each set of deep and shallow exposures, and through\nboth filters, we imaged our clusters in sets of 3 individual observations, to facilitate the removal of cosmic rays (Sec. 2.2).\nFor the HALF field, we obtained deep observations with a\ntotal exposure time of 2500s through each filter. The saturation level for all of the individual calibrated observations,\nas used in our subsequent analysis, is roughly 3600 counts.\nA summary of our CEN and HALF WFPC2 observations is\nincluded in Table 2. In Fig. 1 we show the composite (combined CEN and HALF fields) WFPC2 F555W images of the\ntwo clusters.\nNote the small subcluster \u223c 90\u2032\u2032 (22 pc) South East\nof NGC 1818; this is cluster NGC 1818 B (cf. Will et al.\n1995, Grebel 1997), located at RA(J2000) = 05:04:01.82;\nDec (J2000) = \u221266:26:46.1. NGC 1818 B is found to be of\nsimilar age, \u223c 30 Myr, as NGC 1818 (Grebel 1997), although\nit is not clear whether NGC 1818 B is associated with NGC\n1818. The configuration of both clusters is reminiscent of the\nLMC cluster pair NGC 1850 and NGC 1850 A, which are\napparently physically associated with each other (cf. Caloi\n& Cassatella 1998).\nIn addition, parallel WFPC2 fields, located \u223c 7\u2032 from\neach cluster centre, were obtained with NICMOS as primary\ndetector. These fields, with total exposure times (two images\ncombined) of 1200s and 800s for F555W and F814W, respectively, will be used for the subtraction of the background\nLMC field stars and unresolved background galaxies (Sec.\n3; cf. Castro et al. 2001, SBJG). We will refer to these fields\nas \"NGC 1805-par\" and \"NGC 1818-par\", respectively. In\naddition, we also obtained deeper WFPC2 observations of a\nbackground field (\"Background-1\"), with exposure times of\n7800s and 5200s in F555W and F814W, respectively. This\nfield was selected to represent the faint LMC disk back-\n\nground at a similar distance from the bar to the clusters\nof interest here.\nThe WFPC2 results presented in this paper are based\non an independent reprocessing of the data used by SBJG\n(using slightly different methods) as a check that the results\nare not sensitive to the data reduction techniques applied.\n2.1.2\n\nSTIS imaging observations\n\nWe also obtained deep STIS CCD observations of small sections of the cluster HALF fields in ACCUM imaging mode\nthrough the F28\u00d750LP filter. The fields were exposed for\n2950s each in sets of 5 observations (see also Elson et al.\n1999; Table 2); each observation was split into 2 exposures\nto allow for the removal of cosmic rays by the data processing pipeline. The STIS CCD covers a nominal 52\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 52\u2032\u2032\nsquare field of view, with 1024 \u00d7 1024 \u223c 0.05\u2032\u2032 pixels. The\nactual field of view of our combined HALF fields measures\n48 \u00d7 28\u2032\u2032 , for both clusters.\n2.1.3\n\nWide-field ground-based observations\n\nFinally, we obtained wide-field ground-based observations of\nboth LMC clusters with the ESO New Technology Telescope\n(NTT) at La Silla, Chile, equipped with the EMMI wide field\nimager. These observations were obtained in service mode\non 1 September 2000 using the standard V (#606), and\nI (#610) filters under photometric conditions (see Table 2\nfor the observational characteristics); the seeing FWHM for\nthese observations ranged roughly between 0.8 and 1.0\u2032\u2032 . We\nused EMMI's red Tektronix TK2048 EB Grade 2 CCD, #36,\nwith a pixel size of 0.27\u2032\u2032 and a field of view of 9.15\u2032 \u00d7 8.6\u2032 .\nThe data were reduced following standard reduction procedures; calibration solutions were obtained by using stars in\ncommon between the NTT and WFPC2 fields.\n2.2\n\nImage Processing\n\nPipeline image reduction and recalibration of the WFPC2\nand STIS images was done with standard procedures provided as part of the IRAF/STSDAS\u2021 package, using the updated and corrected on-orbit flat fields and related reference\nfiles most appropriate for our observations.\nSince our WFPC2 images with a common pointing were\naligned to within a few hundredths of a pixel, we simply coadded the individual observations in a given filter for each of\nthe CEN or HALF fields using the IRAF task crrej to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in our images. This task also\nremoved cosmic ray events in a series of iterations that allow correction for cosmic ray hits in pixels adjacent to those\nthat already have been corrected in an earlier iteration. After some experimenting, we found that as few as 3 iterations\n\u2021 The Image Reduction and Analysis Facility (IRAF) is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories, which\nis operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National\nScience Foundation.

We\ncarefully checked that the corruption of the centres of the\nbrighter stars in our images by the cosmic ray rejection routines, due to slight misalignments among the 3 individual\nexposures, was kept to a minimum by comparing the results\nof aperture photometry before and after combining our science exposures.\nAlignment of the individual recalibrated STIS images\nwas ensured by running IRAF's imalign task (requiring\nshifts of . 2 pixels in either direction), upon which a medianfiltered final image was produced using the imcombine task.\nWe used the final images for each of the cluster fields\nand for each filter to obtain source lists (Sec. 2.3) and to\nsubsequently perform aperture photometry on these source\nlists (Sec. 2.4).\n\n2.3\n\nSource Selection\n\nWe based our initial selection of source candidates on a modified version of the daofind task in the daophot software\npackage (Stetson 1987), running under idl.\u00a7\n\n\u00a7 The Interactive Data Language (IDL) is licensed by Research\nSystems Inc., of Boulder, CO.\nc 2001 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nFor both the CEN and HALF fields, we decided to combine and cross-correlate the source lists obtained in both the\nF555W and F814W passbands to define our master source\nlists, for each cluster field. We allowed only a 1-pixel positional mismatch between the individual source detections in\nF555W and F814W. After some experimenting, we decided\nto set our detection thresholds at four times the appropriate\nsky background noise level (\u03c3bg ) in each of our final WFPC2\nimages. This turned out to be the best compromise between\nincluding the maximum number of genuine source detections\nand the minimum number of spurious features due to noise\nor artifacts along diffraction spikes of bright saturated stars\nin the fields.\nThe automated source detection routine, used with suitable constraints on source sharpness and roundness parameters, and the subsequent cross-correlation technique resulted\nin combined source lists largely devoid of non-stellar objects\nand saturated stars, thus minimising potential contamination of our photometry. However, to prevent contamination\nby background galaxies or possibly remaining instrumental\nartifacts, we employed a second size selection criterion to\nour master source lists, using a Gaussian fitting routine to\nestimate source extent. Although the WFPC2 PSF is decidedly non-Gaussian, this technique, when applied uniformly\nto all objects, provides a fairly accurate assessment of the\nrelative object sizes, thus allowing us to distinguish between\nstars and non-stellar objects.

We are very confident that our final source\nlists thus obtained exclusively contain genuine stars.\nFor the STIS images, we also employed a 4 \u03c3bg detection\nlimit and similar final source list selection techniques.\nThe total numbers of genuine stars for each cluster field\nare listed in Table 3.\n\n2.4\n\nAperture Photometry\n\nBecause of the undersampling of point sources by the\nWFPC2 optics, aperture photometry produces more accurate magnitude and colour measurements than PSF fitting,\nin not too crowded fields (cf. Castro et al. 2001, SBJG).\nTherefore, we obtained aperture photometry of the stars in\nour final source lists, using 2-pixel aperture radii. This corresponds to 0.2\u2032\u2032 radii for the 3 WF chips and r = 0.09\u2032\u2032 for\nthe PC. A 2-pixel aperture radius is close to the optimum\nradius for stellar aperture photometry in rich star clusters; it\nproduces the smallest photometric errors and the narrowest\nmain sequence for our sample clusters. It is a compromise\n\nbetween the need to include the core of the PSF but avoid\nlight contamination by neighbouring objects.\nIn addition, to avoid runaway photometric errors due to\nsteep gradients in the background light because of nearby\nbright stars or diffraction spikes, we included a criterion\nto reject sources with mode(background) > (background\n+25 \u00d7 \u03c3bg ). Extensive experimentation showed that this rejection limit only excluded objects for which the photometry\nwas genuinely affected by nearby bright or saturated stars.\nThe number of stars rejected at this stage is also listed in Table 3. The relatively large number of rejected sources in the\nHALF fields of either cluster is due to fact that the parts of\nthe cluster centres imaged by these exposures contain a large\nnumber of bright, saturated stars (due to the long exposure\ntimes), in the vicinity of which the photometric errors are\nunacceptably large.\nSignificant aperture corrections (ACs), determined from\nthe individual data frames, were then applied to the measured magnitudes. For the individual WFPC2 chips, we used\nthe position-dependent ACs to 0.5\u2032\u2032 apertures used by Johnson et al. (2001), defined as AC = a + b rc , where rc is the\ndistance from the centre of the chip in pixels. These ACs\nwere found to be the same for the short and long CEN exposures, as well as for the HALF and parallel (background)\nfields taken close in time.

(1995b), which\naccounts for the difference in gain states between calibration and science observations. For WFPC2 in its state with\nan analog-to-digital gain of 7 electrons (bay 4; as for our\nobservations) GR is 1.987, 2.003, 2.006 and 1.955 for the\nPC, WF2, WF3 and WF4 chips, respectively, subject to an\n\u223c 1% uncertainty. These transformations hold for \u22120.3 <\n(V \u2212 I) < 1.5, which covers most of the colour range of the\nstars in our LMC clusters. The colour terms in Eqs. (1) and\n(2) are defined in the standard system; consequently, the\nequations must be applied iteratively to measures from the\nWFPC2 frames.\nWe found a small offset between source magnitudes\nfrom the long and short CEN exposures (cf. Johnson et al.\n2001). Since the main purpose of the short CEN exposures\nwas to obtain reliable magnitudes for the brightest stars\npopulating the cluster LFs, we applied a simple magnitude\noffset to the short exposures. These offsets, which we have\nlisted in Table 5, were determined over the common range\nof magnitudes in the short and long exposures with similar measurement uncertainties (based on the appearance\nof their CMDs), i.e. in the range 18.6 \u2264 mag \u2264 20.0 and\n18.4 \u2264 mag \u2264 19.8 for NGC 1805 and NGC 1818, respectively, for both V and I.

This lends additional credibility to our photometry.\nAt this point, we combined the master source lists obtained from the CEN long and short exposures, and subsequentially the lists from the combined CEN exposures and\nthe HALF fields. The merging of the short and long CEN\nexposures was based on the following considerations:\n(i) If both long and short magnitudes are available for\na particular object, use the long exposures, but only if\nVlong > Vsat.,long and Ilong > Isat.,long , where the subscript\n\"sat.,long\" indicates the saturation limit of the long exposures (Table 3). Otherwise, use the short exposures, but only\nif the observations are not saturated in at least one passband.\n(ii) If only magnitudes from the long exposures are available for the object, use these if the observations are not\nsaturated in at least one passband.\n(iii) If only short-exposure magnitudes are available, use\nthese if either Vshort < Vsat.,long or Ishort < Isat.,long , and the\nobservations are not saturated in at least one passband.\nBefore combining the CEN and HALF field detections,\nwe also needed to correct the HALF exposures for the small\nphotometric offset found for matching sources in the CEN\nfields; the corresponding offsets are also listed in Table 5.\nThe subsequent merging of the CEN and HALF fields was\ndone largely along similar lines:\n(i) If only magnitudes from the combined CEN list are\navailable, keep these.\n(ii) If both CEN and HALF magnitudes were determined,\nkeep the CEN magnitude if it is brighter than V = 23.0 and\nI = 23.5; otherwise use the HALF data.\n(iii) If only a HALF-field detection was registered, keep\nthis if the object is not saturated in at least one passband.\nFinally, we corrected our photometry for the effects of\nGalactic foreground extinction using the extinction values\ntabulated in Table 1. Most of these values were derived\n\nfrom isochrone fits to the clusters' CMDs (Castro et al.\n2001, SBJG). We determined the extinction in the HST\npassbands assuming the Galactic extinction law of Rieke\n& Lebofsky (1985), convolved with the HST filter shapes,\nAF555W /AV = 1.081 and AF814W /AV = 0.480 (de Grijs et\nal. 2001). One should be cautious to apply an extinction\nestimate for a non-standard bandpass, which is then subsequently transformed to a standard magnitude. For NGC\n1805, however, the difference in the extinction correction between the F555W and V-band filters is negligible for practical purposes, namely \u2264 0.010 mag, while for the F814W/I\nband this reduces to AI \u2212 AF814W \u2264 0.001 mag. The equivalent extinction differences for NGC 1818 are \u2264 0.007 and\n\u2264 0.001 mag, respectively.\n2.5.2\n\nSTIS photometry\n\nTo convert our STIS LP magnitudes to the standard V magnitudes, we first transformed them to WFPC2 flight system\nmagnitudes using the empirical transformations obtained\nby Beaulieu et al. (2001) for STIS CCD observations with\nanalog-to-digital gain 4 (as for our observations):\nV555\n\n=\n\n23.473 \u2212 2.5 \u00d7 log \u010a \u2212 0.5184 \u00d7 (V555 \u2212 I814 )\n\n\u2212\n\n0.0502 \u00d7 (V555 \u2212 I814 )2 ,\n\n(3)\n\nand subsequently used the standard WFPC2-to-ground\ntransformations to obtain standard V magnitudes (cf. Holtzman et al. 1995a). The STIS-to-V555 transformation was derived for the Galactic GC NGC 6553 ([Fe/H] \u2248 \u22120.2) for\nmagnitudes determined in 0.5\u2032\u2032 apertures, and are valid for\nsources with 1.8 . (V555 \u2212 I814 ) . 4.\nHoudashelt et al. (2001) also obtained empirical transformations between STIS LP and WFPC2 flight magnitudes, based on the Galactic GCs 47 Tuc ([Fe/H] \u223c \u22120.7)\nand M15 ([Fe/H] \u223c \u22122.2), using the F606W and F814W\nWFPC2 filters. They concluded that \u2013 if quadratic transformations are assumed (as in Beaulieu et al. 2001) \u2013 there\nis no evidence for a metallicity dependence in the transformation relations. Their transformation equations apply to\nthe entire (V606 \u2212 I814 ) colour range covered by their observations, i.e. 0.35 . (V606 \u2212 I814 ) . 1.85, which translates\nto \u22120.1 . (V555 \u2212 I814 ) . 1.4 for stellar spectral types in\nthe range from early B to G, which is based on the folding\nof synthetic spectra through the filter bandpasses using the\nsynphot package in IRAF.\nSince a significant number of the STIS-detected sources\ndid not have counterparts with well-determined magnitudes\nin either the F555W or F814W images, we assumed all\nsources in the final STIS source list to be cluster stars and\napproximated their (V555 \u2212 I814 ) colours to be those of the\nmain sequence stars of the appropriate magnitude determined from our WFPC2 CMDs.\nTo correct for foreground extinction, we used the extinction correction obtained by Beaulieu et al. (2001), AVLP =\n2.505E(B \u2212 V ), which is based on integration across the\npassband.\n\n2.6\n\nCompleteness\n\nDue to the significant stellar density gradient across the cluster fields, completeness corrections are a strong function of\nc 2001 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fMass segregation in young LMC clusters I.\nposition within a cluster. Therefore, we computed completeness corrections for all observations in circular annuli around\nthe centre of each cluster, for both the PC and the WF fields,\nlocated at intervals between the centre and 3.6\u2032\u2032 , 3.6 \u2212 7.2\u2032\u2032 ,\n7.2\u221218.0\u2032\u2032 , 18.0\u221236.0\u2032\u2032 , 36.0\u221254.0\u2032\u2032 and at radii \u2265 54.0\u2032\u2032 . At\nthe distance of the LMC, 1\u2032\u2032 corresponds to \u223c 0.25 pc. The\ncluster centre coordinates, included in Table 1, were determined by smoothing the cluster light distributions and subsequently applying an ellipse-fitting routine to the smoothed\ncluster profiles.\nWe added an area-dependent number of Gaussian\nsources to the individual annuli, ranging from \u223c 60 in the\ninner annulus to 2000 in the outer, partial annulus. We created artificial source fields for input magnitudes between\n15.0 and 27.0 mag, in steps of 0.5 mag. Their (V \u2212I) colours\nwere distributed following the clusters' main sequence ridge\nlines, i.e., they were magnitude dependent. We then applied\nthe same source detection routines to the fields containing\nthe combined cluster stars and the artificial sources. The results of this exercise, based on the long CEN exposures, are\nshown in Fig. 2. These completeness curves were corrected\nfor the effects of blending or superposition of multiple randomly placed artificial stars as well as for the superposition\nof artificial stars on genuine objects. Due to the large number of bright, saturated stars in the innermost annulus of\nNGC 1805, proper completeness tests could not be done in\nthis area; for comparison, we have plotted the corresponding completeness curve in this area for the short CEN exposures instead. The progressive increase in completeness\nfraction with radius for a given source brightness clearly illustrates the potentially serious effects of crowding in the\ninner regions of the clusters. In the analysis performed in\nthis paper, we only include those ranges of the stellar LF\nwhere the completeness fraction is in excess of 50%.\nAs mentioned in Sec. 2.3, the HST PSF is non-Gaussian\nin shape. Therefore, we have introduced an additional uncertainty by adding Gaussian-shaped artificial objects to our\nscience frames for the completeness analysis. A detailed comparison of the light profiles of the Gaussian sources on the\none hand and PSFs from the WFPC2 PSF library and Tiny\nTim artificial PSFs on the other, reveals that, except for\nthe innermost pixel, both light profiles closely match each\nother. Since our source detection routine requires information on both the brightness and the shape of the objects\nin order to include them, and because for those magnitudes\nwhere the incompleteness becomes significant source detections are photon noise limited and therefore relatively independent of the stellar profile shape, we estimate that by\nusing Gaussian light profiles, we will have obtained conservative completeness estimates. In other words, for any given\nmagnitude range, we may have obtained completeness fractions that are marginally too low, and would need to be\nshifted to slightly fainter magnitudes (\u226a 0.5 mag).\nWe also determined completeness curves for the background fields. Thanks to their low stellar density, a single\ncompleteness curve for the WF chips was found to apply to\nany one background field, as shown in Fig. 3. The higher\nresolution obtained with the PC translates into a greater\ncompleteness fraction compared to the WF chips. The completeness curves for the NGC 1805-par and NGC 1818-par\nfields are identical, within the observational uncertainties.\nFinally, we applied the same analysis to the STIS scic 2001 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n9\n\nence frames and background fields, using a single completeness curve for the entire STIS field of view. The 50% completeness limit occurs at V555 \u2243 25 and \u2243 24.5 in NGC 1805\nand NGC 1818, respectively, for the science frames and \u2013\ndue to their shorter exposure times \u2013 roughly 0.2\u20130.3 mag\nbrighter in the parallel background fields.\n\n3\n\nAPPROACH: DATA PREPARATION AND\nLUMINOSITY FUNCTIONS\n\nIn this section, we will examine the dependence of the shape\nand slope of the stellar LF on position within the clusters.\nWe basically use the cluster LFs as smoothing functions of\nthe full two-dimensional (V, V\u2013I) CMDs. The full N-body\nmodeling of the cluster CMDs, fully inclusive of the latest\ninput physics (e.g., binary star mergers), except the effects\nof mass segregation, was discussed by Johnson et al. (2001)\nand shown to represent the observed CMDs very well. Where\nthe full 2-dimensional CMDs were used to infer the presence\nand the effects of mass segregation, this was mostly based\non differences in the concentration of specific stellar types,\nmost often main sequence and giant branch stars, in young\nLMC clusters (cf. Sect. 1.1) and old GCs (e.g., in NGC 1851,\nSaviane et al. 1998; NGC 5466, Nemec & Harris 1987; Pal\n12, Harris & Canterna 1980; and 47 Tuc, Da Costa 1982).\nHowever, our cluster stars start to saturate at the faint end\nof the red giant branch, so this approach is not feasible. In\nfact, with the exception of a handful of the brightest stars,\nwe are limited to the analysis of the main sequence stars in\nthese clusters (cf. the CMDs in Johnson et al. 2001).\nIn order to study the positional dependence of the LF\nwithin our star clusters, we need to correct the observed\nstellar LFs in the CEN and HALF fields for the contribution of stars from the galactic (LMC) background in these\nfields. For that purpose, we obtained the background field\nLFs using identical procedures as for the CEN and HALF\nfields themselves. The resulting LFs are statistically indistinguishable from Castro et al.'s (2001) LFs, although small\nnon-systematic differences occur due to the different methods used. We combined the LFs obtained from the three individual fields into a single background LF. The uncertainties\ndue to possible background variations thus introduced are\nnegligible compared to the errors in our source magnitudes,\nin particular for the fainter stars, where such background\nvariations would be of importance (cf. Castro et al. 2001).\nThe LFs needed to be scaled to apply to the appropriate areas used to study the radial dependence of the cluster LFs, and subsequently subtracted from those. Since all\nof our background fields have longer exposure times than\nthe longest CEN exposures, saturation sets in at brighter\nmagnitudes than for these CEN fields. To correct for the\nbackground contribution at the brightest magnitudes, V \u2264\nVsat.,bg , and I \u2264 Isat.,bg , we simply extrapolated the background field LFs to V = Vsat.,short , and I = Isat.,short , i.e., to\nthe brightest unsaturated stars in our short CEN exposures.\nThe extrapolated number of background field stars brighter\nthan the saturation limits of our background fields is negligible for practical purposes, however. In the remainder of\nthis paper, when we refer to the cluster LFs, this applies to\nthe background-corrected LFs.\nForeground stars are not a source of confusion in the\n\n\f10\n\nR. de Grijs et al.\n\nFigure 2.

From careful inspection of the\nCMDs presented by Johnson et al. (2001), we conclude that\nfor V . 23 there are most likely no foreground stars in our\nfields of view. This is consistent with the standard Milky\nWay star count models (e.g., Ratnatunga & Bahcall 1985).\n\n3.1\n\nEvidence for systematic luminosity\nsegregation\n\nFigs. 4 and 5 show the distribution of stellar magnitudes as\na function of distance from the cluster centres. The shaded\nhistograms represent the total number of stars in our final\nsource lists, not corrected for incompleteness, area covered\nor background star contamination; the thick solid lines are\nthe actual cluster star distributions, obtained by subtracting\nthe background contribution expected in the area covered by\nc 2001 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fMass segregation in young LMC clusters I.\n\n11\n\nFigure 3. Completeness curves for the background fields. The different line styles refer to the individual WFPC2 chips; the smaller\npixel size of the PC chip (solid lines) clearly increases the completeness fraction; for the WF chips (dotted, long and short-dashed lines),\na single completeness correction applies.\n\neach annulus from the observed total LFs and subsequently\ncorrecting for incompleteness effects. The 50% completeness\nlimits in each annulus are indicated by the vertical dashed\nlines through the centres of the last magnitude bin above\nthis limit. We have used the V-band completeness curves to\ncorrect our LFs for the effects of incompleteness. However,\nsince the final source lists of cluster stars were based on\ncross referencing the detections both in the V and I bands,\nwe need to be careful close to the 50% completeness limit\nin V. Close examination of Fig. 2 shows that the I-band\nc 2001 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nmagnitude is always brighter than the corresponding V-band\nmagnitude, for any completeness fraction. This affects the\nderived LFs in Fig. 4, in particular for MV . 2.7 (R \u2264 7.2\u2032\u2032 )\nand MV . 3.5 (7.2 < R \u2264 14.4\u2032\u2032 ), so that any LF slope\nderived for these radial ranges and including stars within\n\u223c 1.5 magnitude of the 50% completeness limit is a lower\nlimit. This effect does not play a significant role for NGC\n1818.\nSecondly, for the inner radial bin (R \u2264 7.2\u2032\u2032 ) of NGC\n1805 the incompleteness for the fainter stars is severe due to\n\n\f12\n\nR. de Grijs et al.\n\nthe large concentration of bright stars in the very compact\ncore of this cluster. Therefore, the declining LF for MV & 1\nis likely due to the central incompleteness in this inner radial\nbin, and any LF slope derived for these stars will thus also\nbe a lower limit.\nThe effects of strong luminosity segregation are clearly\nvisible, in the sense that the brighter cluster stars are\nstrongly concentrated in the inner \u223c 20\u2032\u2032 in each cluster.\nThe brightest unsaturated cluster stars, i.e., V . 17, consist of a mixture of stars at the top of the main sequence\nand giant branch/red clump stars (cf. the CMDs in Johnson et al. 2001), which span only a very narrow mass range,\nwhile the fainter stars are main sequence stars. The effects\nare strongest in NGC 1805; strong luminosity segregation\nin this cluster was already apparent from an initial visual\nexamination of Fig. 1.\nIn Figs. 6a and b we show all annular cluster LFs out\nto R = 72.0\u2032\u2032 , corrected for the effects of incompleteness (as\na function of radial distance from the cluster centres), background contamination and for the sampling area covered by\neach (partial) annulus, for NGC 1805 and NGC 1818, respectively. In this representation, the radial dependence of\nthe cluster LFs is more easily visible than in Figs. 4 and\n5. For the NGC 1818 field, these annular LFs are not contaminated by the companion cluster NGC 1818 B, since the\nlatter is located at larger radii than covered by our LFs.\nWe also show the overall cluster LFs, constructed by adding\nall individual annular LFs weighted by the area covered by\nthe observations. This procedure ensures the proper treatment of the sampling incompleteness at each annular radius.\nFor NGC 1805 the completeness corrections of the innermost annulus (and to some lesser degree also of the second\nannulus) are uncertain due to severe crowding and statistical noise (small-number statistics), likely causes an artificial\nturndown for the lowest luminosities. However, the contribution of this annular LF to the overall LF is . 5%, because\nof the weighting by area used in its construction, with the\ninner annulus covering only \u223c 1.7% of the total area covered\nby our observations for R \u2264 72.0\u2032\u2032\nIn paper III we will extend the overall LFs down to\nthe lowest-luminosity sources detected reliably in our STIS\nfields, for the entire LMC cluster sample. Our ultimate aim\nis to determine whether the cluster LFs \u2013 and thus their MFs\n\u2013 are statistically indistinguishable or significantly different\nover the entire mass range, down to the lowest masses. This\nforms part of our efforts to determine the strength of the\napparent universality of the IMF.\nWe subsequently determined the LF slopes, assuming\na simple power-law dependence, i.e., N (L) \u221d L\u2212\u03b1 , where\n\u03b1 is the LF slope (but see Sec. 4). Although we used the\npower-law approximation to be able to compare our results\nto previously published LF slopes, we realise that the inner LFs in Figs. 4 and 5 show a clear maximum inside our\nfitting ranges, and that the overall cluster LFs are clearly\nnot linear. Despite this, a comparison of LF slopes obtained\nusing power-law fits over identical luminosity ranges is still\nvaluable to quantify the radial dependence of the cluster\nLFs, however. We chose to use fitting ranges in luminosity that covered the maximum overlap among our annular\nLFs in order to minimise the effects of small-scale statistical fluctuations in the LFs. For NGC 1805, we used the\nranges \u22122.2 \u2264 MV \u2264 4.2 (2.81 \u2265 log(LV /LV,\u2299 ) \u2265 0.25)\n\nfor R \u2264 72.0\u2032\u2032 and the slightly greater common magnitude\nrange \u22122.2 \u2264 MV \u2264 5.0 (2.81 \u2265 log(LV /LV,\u2299 ) \u2265 \u22120.07)\nfor 7.2 < R \u2264 72.0\u2032\u2032 . The latter magnitude range was also\nused for fitting the LF slopes in NGC 1818, and is indicated\nby the vertical dashed fitting boundaries in Fig. 6. We note,\nhowever, that Johnson et al.'s (2001) CMDs show confusion\nby Be stars for V . 17, MV . \u22121.6, so that our brightest\ndata point needs to be taken with caution. This does not\naffect the overall results presented in this section, however.\nThe error bars in the LF slopes include the formal error and\nthe statistical uncertainties due to poisson noise.\nIn the top panels of Fig. 7 we show the dependence of\nthe slope of the LF on cluster radius; the radial ranges to\nwhich the data points apply are indicated by small bars at\nthe bottom of each panel.\nWe have also included the LF slopes from the STIS\nHALF field LFs (open squares), obtained following identical procedures as for the WFPC2 V-band LFs. We used a\nfitting range to obtain the LF slope of \u22121.0 \u2264 MV \u2264 5.0\n(2.33 \u2265 log(LV /LV,\u2299 ) \u2265 \u22120.07) for both of our single fields.\nThe source distributions in our STIS fields peak at 58.4\u2032\u2032\nand 44.2\u2032\u2032 for NGC 1805 and NGC 1818, respectively. Their\nradial extent is roughly 48 and 44\u2032\u2032 , respectively (i.e., the\nFWHMs of the radial distributions). The fact that the STIS\ndata points are entirely consistent with the WFPC2 results,\nalthough they were determined completely independently\nand using a different detector, confirms the robustness of\nthese results. For comparison, we have also indicated the\nLF slopes one would arrive at by taking the overall cluster\nLFs, indicated by \"all\".\nBoth clusters show clear evidence of luminosity segregation, in the sense that the LF slopes steepen with increasing\ncluster radius. In NGC 1805, the LF slopes reach a stable\nlevel beyond \u2243 15\u2032\u2032 (or \u223c 3.8 pc), well beyond the cluster's\nhalf-light radius at 1.8 pc. A stable LF slope is reached for\nR & 25\u2032\u2032 (\u223c 6.3 pc) in NGC 1818, again indicating strong\nluminosity segregation in the inner annuli.\nAlthough the trend towards steeper LFs with increasing radius is clear, the associated error bars are large. They\nare the formal errors from the fit of a single power law to\nthe data points, and are therefore dominated by the nonlinearity of the annular LFs and point-to-point variations.\nThe non-linear behaviour of the annular LFs is also our preferred explanation for the \u223c 10% difference in measured LF\nslopes for our two fitting ranges in luminosity used for NGC\n1805. We will return to this issue in Sec. 4.\n\n3.2\n\nThe brightest cluster stars\n\nFinally, we can use the distribution of the saturated stars\nin the short CEN exposures to strengthen our conclusions\non the presence of strong luminosity segregation in both\nclusters. Saturated stars in the short CEN exposures are\nbrighter than 15.5, and 15.0 mag (in both V and I) in NGC\n1805 and NGC 1818, respectively. Fig. 8 shows the radial\ndistribution of these brightest cluster members, in units of\nthe clusters' half-light radii. We show the original star counts\nas the dashed histograms. However, to interpret these distributions in terms of mass segregation, we need to correct\nthese for the underlying cluster surface brightness distribution. We assumed King-like cluster profiles of the form sugc 2001 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fMass segregation in young LMC clusters I.\n\n13\n\nFigure 4. Observational total LFs from our WFPC2 data in annuli at increasingly large radii from the NGC 1805 cluster centre\n(histograms). The thick solid lines are the actual cluster star distributions, after correction for the background field star contribution\nand the effects of incompleteness; the 50% completeness limits are indicated by the vertical dashed lines. The numbers on the right-hand\nside in each panel refer to the corresponding annular LFs in Fig. 6. The main sequence turn-off magnitudes (\"MSTO\") are indicated by\nthe arrows.\n\ngested by Elson et al. (1987) to obtain the corrected, shaded\nhistograms.\nWe can firmly rule out a Galactic foreground origin for\nthese sources, since the standard Milky Way models predict\n. 0.005 foreground stars to appear in an area corresponding to the PC field of view towards these clusters. There is\nclear evidence for luminosity segregation in both clusters,\nwith a strong concentration of the brightest stars within the\nc 2001 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\ninner \u223c 4 and \u223c 8Rhl in NGC 1805 and NGC 1818, respectively. This result is largely independent of the radial bin\nsize adopted.\n\n3.3\n\nEjection of bright stars?\n\nFollowing similar procedures as for the WFPC2 observations, we obtained calibrated V and I-band source lists for\n\n\f14\n\nR. de Grijs et al.\n\nFigure 5. Same as Fig. 4, but for NGC 1818.\n\nthe wide-field NTT data. These observations were obtained\nto study the distribution of cluster (and field) stars near and\nabove the main sequence turn-off, which occurs at V \u223c 17\nfor both clusters. The magnitude range 15.5 . V . 20.0 is\navailable for the combined cluster and field star populations.\nThe main purpose of our use of the NTT fields was to\nestablish whether there is evidence that a fraction of the\nbrighter cluster stars have been ejected from the cluster on\ntime-scales similar to the cluster ages, \u223c 10\u221225 Myr. Therefore, we examined the radial distributions of the combined\ncluster+field star populations (centred on the cluster centres) for 0.5 mag bins, ranging from V = 15.5 to V = 20.0.\n\nBased on Figs. 4 and 5, we conclude that for radii R & 72.0\u2032\u2032\nthe LFs are dominated by the background field population.\nWe will therefore conservatively focus our analysis of the\nNTT fields on radial 100 pixel (27\u2032\u2032 ) bins beyond R = 100\u2032\u2032 ,\nout to the edge of our fields of view at \u2243 330\u2032\u2032 . For stars\nfainter than V \u223c 17.5, the numbers of stars as a function\nof radius, corrected for the area covered, are consistent with\na flat distribution. This indicates that for these magnitude\nbins the observed stellar population is largely dominated by\nthe background field. Therefore, we decided to use the radial\ndistribution of stars in the magnitude range 18.5 \u2264 V \u2264 19.5\n(0 . MV . 1) as our control sample, to be used for the\nc 2001 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fMass segregation in young LMC clusters I.\n\n15\n\nFigure 6.

For reasons of clarity, we have omitted the vertical error bars. The\ndotted lines covering the range between the fitting boundaries (vertical dashed lines) and representing the largest numbers of stars /\narcmin2 are the overall cluster LFs. The annular bins are numbered as in Figs. 4 and 5, and represented by the following line styles\n(inside outwards), from top to bottom: solid, dotted, short dashed, long dashed, dot-dashed, dotted (STIS HALF fields, \"S\"), solid, and\ndotted.

At fainter\nmagnitudes, one needs to take significant incompleteness\ncorrections into account.\nAlthough the numbers of bright stars in each of our\nfields are small (up to several tens in each 0.5 mag bin, for\nthe entire radial range from 100\u2032\u2032 \u2212 330\u2032\u2032 ), for NGC 1818\nthere appears to be an excess of \u223c 8 \u2212 10% of brighter stars\n(i.e., an excess of 18 \u00b1 8 stars of 15.5 \u2264 V \u2264 16.0, as well\nas brighter, saturated stars) towards the inner radial cutoff at 100\u2032\u2032 compared to the control sample. Because of the\nrelatively small numbers of bright stars, and the associated\nstatistical uncertainties, this is a \u223c 2\u03c3 result. This overdensity is consistent with a radially decreasing distribution,\nc 2001 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nsuggesting that these bright stars are associated with NGC\n1818. We will discuss the implications of this in terms of\nformation scenarios or dynamical ejection from the cluster\ncore in Sec. 4.3.\nFor stars with magnitudes V > 16.5 in NGC 1818 and\nfor the entire range in magnitudes for NGC 1805, the radial\ndistributions are consistent with randomly distributed stars\nin the field, again compared to our control sample, 18.5 \u2264\nV \u2264 19.5.\nFinally, for the NTT field of view used for this analysis\n(540\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 509\u2032\u2032 ), the Galaxy models of Ratnatunga & Bahcall\n(1985) predict roughly 14 foreground stars in the range 15 \u2264\nV \u2264 17. Our samples contain at least twice as many stars\nin this magnitude range, for either field. In addition, if a\nsignificant fraction of the stars in this magnitude range were\nGalactic foreground stars, they would not be expected to be\nconcentrated on the clusters, as found for NGC 1818.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nDISCUSSION\nComparison with previously published results\n\nIn this section, we compare our results to those of SBJG to\nillustrate the sensitivity of a simple single-parameter fit of\nan LF to star count data for compact star clusters. All of the\nadopted luminosity range, radial range, completeness range,\nand background subtraction affect an apparently robust result.\nSince SBJG's published annular LF slopes were determined over a different magnitude fitting range than ours,\n\n\f16\n\nR. de Grijs et al.\n\nFigure 7.

We have also indicated\nthe slope one would measure based on the overall cluster LFs (right-hand subpanels), and the slope obtained from the STIS HALF\nfield CLFs (open squares).

The horizontal dashed and dotted lines represent the sky background level and\nits 1-\u03c3 uncertainty, respectively, as discussed in the text.\n\nwe redetermined the slopes for both our LFs and those of\nSBJG over the common magnitude range 0.25 \u2264 MV \u2264 4.25\n(1.83 \u2265 log(LV /LV,\u2299 ) \u2265 0.23), after converting SBJG's\nWFPC2 flight system magnitudes to the standard V-band\nsystem. The results are shown in Figs. 7c and d, where the\n\nblack dots represent the slopes determined from the LFs\nderived in this paper and the open circles are those from\nSBJG's published figures. The right-hand subpanels show\nthe LF slopes if we had considered the entire stellar distribution of the clusters at once. We observe reasonable conc 2001 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fMass segregation in young LMC clusters I.\nsistency between our results, within the associated fitting\nuncertainties, although a small discrepancy is seen in the\nouter regions, beyond R \u2243 50\u2032\u2032 for NGC 1805 and R \u2243 70\u2032\u2032\nfor NGC 1818. Small differences between the overall cluster\nLFs of NGC 1805 could be explained by the fact that we\nused a radial range R \u2264 72.0\u2032\u2032 , while SBJG's overall LF is\nbased on the cluster members out to R = 102.0\u2032\u2032 .\nAlthough the consistency between both our results is\nencouraging, in particular since they were obtained entirely\nindependently, this comparison shows clearly that (annular) cluster LFs obtained at large distances from the cluster\ncentre are significantly affected by small differences in the\ntreatment of the background field star confusion and are\ntherefore highly uncertain. In order to estimate the effect\nof background confusion, we determined the LF slope, using identical absolute magnitude ranges as for the cluster\nLFs (corrected for incompleteness), for our two radial bins\nat radii R > 72.0\u2032\u2032 to investigate this effect. The resulting\nLF slopes for the background LMC stars are shown in Figs.\n7c and d as the dashed lines with their associated 1-\u03c3 uncertainties at the bottom of these panels.\nThus, we conclude that the value derived for the LF\nslope is critically dependent on the range in (absolute) magnitude (or luminosity) used for the fitting. However, if done\nconsistently for the entire cluster sample, for all radial annuli, the relative variations among LF slopes as a function\nof radius are more robust.\nFinally, Hunter et al. (1997) converted their WFPC2\nannular LFs of NGC 1818 into their associated MFs, but\ndid not find evidence for mass segregation in this cluster\nfor stellar masses in the range 0.85 \u2264 m \u2264 9M\u2299 . However,\nthey noted that the cluster core contains brighter stars that\nwere not included in their study due to saturation, whereas\nthe outer regions do not. The exposure times of their shortexposure F555W images are four times as long as those of\nour short exposures, resulting in a significantly greater fraction of saturated stars in their images. Therefore, we believe\nthat the difference between our and their results is largely\ndue to this saturation effect. Unfortunately, they did not\npublish background and incompleteness corrected LFs, so\nthat we cannot directly compare our results. In paper II\nwe will discuss these differences in more detail based on a\ncomparison of the cluster MFs.\n\n4.2\n\nIs there a representative cluster radius?\n\nBecause of the sensitivity of the LF slope to the adopted\nluminosity and radial range and to the accuracy of the corrections for incompleteness and background star contamination of single power law fits to the annular LFs, we introduce a more robust characterisation of the presence of\nluminosity segregation in the NGC 1805 and NGC 1818 in\nFig. 9. To minimise the sensitivity of the LF slope to these\neffects, we decided to quantify the deviations of the highluminosity range of the annular LFs from the global LF. All\nannular LFs were normalised to the global LF in the range\n\u22120.1 \u2264 log(LV /LV,\u2299 ) \u2264 1.0; subsequently, we determined\nthe average sum of the differences between the global and the\nscaled annular LFs in the common luminosity range 1.0 <\nlog(LV /LV,\u2299 ) \u2264 2.57 (log(LV /LV,\u2299 )\u0010 \u2243 2.57 corresponds\n\u0011\n\nto the main sequence turn-off), \u03a3red \u2206 log N (LV /LV,\u2299 ) .\nc 2001 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n17\n\nFigure 9. Deviations of the annular LFs from the global LF as\na function of radius, as discussed in the text. The filled symbols represent the WFPC2 data of NGC 1805 and NGC 1818,\nrespectively; the open symbols at large radii are their STIS counterparts, which are upper limits due to the observed curvature\nof the LFs (see text). The error bars are dominated by statistical fluctuations in the LFs due to poisson noise. The horizontal\nbars at the bottom of the figure indicate the radial range used\nto obtain the data points; the vertical dotted lines represent the\nclusters' half-light radii.\n\nThe result for the inner two radial bins of NGC 1805 are\nupper limits due to the severe incompleteness effects for lowluminosity stars in its centre (cf. Section 3.1). In order to\nconstrain these upper limits to their most likely range, we\ndecided to adopt the shape of the third annulus (14.4\u2032\u2032 <\nR \u2264 21.6\u2032\u2032 ) matched to the number counts of the inner\nannulus in the luminosity range 1.5 \u2264 log LV /LV,\u2299 \u2264 1.9\nas a conservative estimate of the \"true\" inner LFs \u2013 based\non the robust assumption of no luminosity segregation for\nlog LV /LV,\u2299 \u2264 1.0 at R \u223c 18\u2032\u2032 = 1.53Rhl \u2013 and repeated\nthe above procedure for the inner two annuli. The resulting\ndata points are shown as open symbols. Since the STIS LFs\ndo not reach the brightest luminosity cut-off, we were forced\nto use a smaller fitting range; the resulting STIS data points\nare therefore upper limits, since the LFs are curved and not\nsingle power laws.\nFrom Fig. 9, it is immediately clear that both clusters\nare luminosity segregated to at least R \u2243 3 \u2212 4Rhl , beyond\nwhich radius the deviations become relatively constant with\nincreasing radius. Although it appears that the global cluster LF is fairly well approximated by half-light LF (\u2243 Rcore\nfor these young clusters), the LFs at these radii are not representative of the dominant cluster stars, but are dominated\nby the segregated high-luminosity stars. In Paper III we will\naddress this issue in more detail for our larger LMC cluster\nsample, for which we will investigate whether the cluster age\naffects the radius at which the local LF becomes representative of the cluster population as a whole.\n\n4.3\n\nDynamical evolution on short time-scales?\n\nIn Sec. 3.3 we presented evidence for a marginal excess of\nbright stars (V \u2264 16.0), corresponding to the most massive\nunsaturated stars in our LFs (see Paper II), surrounding\nNGC 1818 compared to the expected number of stars in the\nbackground field. For NGC 1805, our results are inconclusive.\nIt is unlikely that they originated independently from\n\n\f18\n\nR. de Grijs et al.\n\nthe cluster in the background field. Although the LMC background field shows significant density contrasts, including in\nour NTT fields, the bright stars are not preferentially located\nin any of these. In particular, only 1 or 2 of them are located\nin the NGC 1818 B subcluster, while none of them seem to\nbe associated with the open cluster-like object at \u223c 360\u2032\u2032 to\nthe North West of the cluster centre.\nTherefore, they are most likely massive stars that have\nbeen collisionally ejected from the cluster core due to encounters with other massive stars or binary systems. Although standard two-body interactions involving equal mass\nobjects are not expected to eject a significant number of\nstars over the short lifetime of NGC 1818, unequal mass encounters, primordial mass segregation and \u2013 in particular \u2013\nthe presence of hard binaries can have a significant effect on\nthe dynamical ejection of massive stars on short time-scales\n(e.g., Leonard & Duncan 1988, 1990, Leonard 1995, Portegies Zwart et al. 1999, Hoogerwerf, de Bruijne & de Zeeuw\n2000, Brandl et al. 2001). In addition, the dynamical relaxation time of massive stars can be significantly shorter than\nthat of low-mass stars (cf. Portegies Zwart et al. 1999).\nThus, this interpretation suggests that the cores of massive young star clusters undergo significant dynamical evolution, even on time-scales as short as \u223c 25 Myr. A more\nextreme example of the dynamical evolution in the core of a\nvery young star cluster was recently presented for the . 3\u22124\nMyr old core of 30 Dor, R136 (Brandl et al. 2001).\nIn Paper II we will explore this issue in more detail; we\nwill convert our LFs into the associated MFs and discuss the\nimplications of the observed mass segregation in the context\nof mass segregation at birth versus that due to dynamical\nevolution.\n\n5\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper, we have presented a detailed analysis of\nHST/WFPC2 and STIS imaging observations, and of supplementary wide-field ground-based observations obtained\nwith the NTT of two young (\u223c 10 \u2212 25 Myr) compact star\nclusters in the LMC, NGC 1805 and NGC 1818.\nIn principle, rich compact LMC star clusters are ideal\nlaboratories for providing strong constraints on the universality of the IMF, in particular because they are essentially\nsingle-age, single-metallicity systems for which individual\nstars over a range of masses can easily be resolved. However,\nin order to understand the cluster IMF, a detailed knowledge of the presence and the effects of mass segregation is\nrequired. Observations of various degrees of mass segregation in very young star clusters suggest that at least some of\nthis effect is related to the process of star formation itself.\nIn this paper, we have focussed on the analysis of the\nbehaviour of the stellar LF as a function of radius in these\ntwo young LMC clusters; in Paper II, we will derive the associated MFs and discuss alternative diagnostics to quantify\nmass segregation effects, such as the dependence of cluster\ncore radius on the adopted mass (or luminosity) range.\nAlthough the effects are strongest in NGC 1805, the\nmore strongly concentrated cluster, we present clear evidence for strong luminosity segregation in both clusters:\n(i) The brighter cluster stars are strongly concentrated in\nthe inner \u223c 3 \u2212 4Rhl in each cluster. Compared to the outer\n\ncluster regions, the fainter stars in the central annuli are\nsignificantly underpopulated relative to the brighter stars.\n(ii) The LF slopes steepen with cluster radius. In both\nclusters, the LF slopes reach a stable level well beyond the\nclusters' half-light radii.\n(iii) The brightest, saturated cluster stars (V, I . 15.5\nand 15.0 for NGC 1805 and NGC 1818, respectively) are\npredominantly located within the inner \u223c 4 \u2212 8Rhl .\nFrom a detailed analysis of the shape of the LF, we show\nthat the value derived for the LF slope is critically dependent\non the range in (absolute) magnitude (or luminosity) used\nfor the fitting.\nFinally, from the wide-field NTT observations we\npresent tentative evidence for the presence of bright stars\nsurrounding NGC 1818 which we argue to be associated with\nthe cluster. We suggest that they are most likely massive\nstars that have been collisionally ejected from the cluster\ncore due to unequal-mass encounters, primordial mass segregation or collisions with (hard) binary systems. This interpretation leads us to suggest, therefore, that the cores of\nmassive young stars clusters undergo significant dynamical\nevolution, even on time-scales as short as \u223c 25 Myr.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis paper is based on observations with the NASA/ESA\nHubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope\nScience Institute, which is operated by the Association of\nUniversities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.
