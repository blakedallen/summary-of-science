INTRODUCTION\n\nOne of the most active areas of quantum-gravity research over the last decade concerns the fate of Lorentz symmetry in the\nquantum-gravity realm1 . It is turning out to be particularly useful to divide all such studies into three categories: (i) cases where\nLorentz/Poincar\u00e9 symmetry remains unaffected; (ii) cases where there are departures from classical Lorentz/Poincar\u00e9 symmetry and they are such that a preferred-frame picture arises; (iii) cases where there are departures from classical Lorentz/Poincar\u00e9\nsymmetry but the relativity of inertial frames is preserved. This third option, which was proposed in Refs. [1], is the one that\nchallenges us more significantly for what concerns formalization. The case of \"broken Lorentz symmetry\" (with a preferred\nframe) is technically not much more challenging that a standard special-relativistic case, since it allows formalizations that\nare rather familiar, already relevant for example in the analysis of conventional propagation of light in certain material media\n(which indeed provide a preferred frame for the analysis of those physical contexts). Instead formalizing \"deformations of\nLorentz symmetry\", in the sense of the \"DSR\" (\"doubly-special\", or \"deformed-special\", relativity) proposal of Refs. [1],\nrequires us to find ways of introducing departures from Lorentz/Poincar\u00e9 symmetry while preserving the delicate balance\nthat can assure the relativity of inertial frames. This DSR proposal focuses on the possibility of relativistic theories with two\ncharacterizing invariant scales, introducing a length/inverse-momentum scale l with relativistic properties analogous to the\nfamiliar ones of the speed-of-light scale c. From a quantum-gravity perspective it would then be natural [1] to assume that the\nnew relativistic-invariant scale l be roughly of the order of the inverse of the Planck scale (the \"Planck length\").\nAt this point there is a rich literature on DSR-deformations of Lorentz symmetry, with several encouraging results (see,\ne.g., Refs. [1\u20137] and references therein). Most of these results concern DSR-relativistic formulations of the possibility of\nintroducing relativistically some deformed on-shell relations and some associated deformations of the laws of composition of\nmomenta. The DSR proposal was put forward [1] as a conceptual path for pursuing a broader class of scenarios of interest\nfor fundamental physics, and in particular for quantum-gravity research, including the possibility of introducing the second\nobserver-independent scale primitively in spacetime structure or primitively at the level of the (deformed) de Broglie relation\nbetween wavelength and momentum. However, the bulk of the relevant preliminary results from quantum-gravity research\nconcern departures from the special-relativistic on-shell relation, and this in turn became the main focus of DSR research.\nI here investigate issues relevant for one of the most significant residual open issue for such studies of DSR-relativistic\ndeformations of on-shell (and momentum-conservation) relations, which concerns the description of composite particles,\nsuch as atoms. In some of the most studied attempts of formulating DSR-relativistic theories it emerges that \"DSR-composite\nparticles\" should have relativistic properties different from those of their constituents. The simplest way to see that this might\nbe the case is to consider a bunch of N ultrarelativistic particles all propagating along the 1 direction and each governed, say,\nby\np0 \u2243 p1 +\n\nm2\n\u2212 lp21\n2p1\n\n(1)\n\nWe can then introduce some candidates for \"total spatial momentum\" and \"total energy\", given by P0 = N p0 and P1 = N p1 ,\nand observe that the validity of (1) for each of the N particles implies\n\nP0 \u2243 P1 +\n\nlP 2\n\u03bc2\n\u2212 1 ,\n2P1\nN\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03bc = Nm is the rest energy of the N-particle system. The suppression by 1/N of the last term of this Eq. (2) illustrates\nthe issue: the nonlinearity of the DSR laws has nontrivial consequences for particle composites.\nMuch more than this simple-minded argument supports the concern that composite particles should have relativistic properties\n\n1\n\nThe relevant aspect of the quantum-gravity problem is the \"quasi-Minkowski limit\" of quantum gravity, the limit where quantum gravity should reproduce\nin first approximation (describing small modifications of) particle physics and its special-relativistic properties.\n\n\f3\nwhich are different from those of their constituents, and in particular the effects of the deformation should be more weakly felt\nby composites. I shall not review here these more sophisticated arguments, for which I refer my readers to Refs. [3, 8] and,\nmost notably, Ref. [9]. Let me stress however that these technical arguments, based on the nonlinearity of the laws and the\nway it can affect the description of composites, also makes sense physically: while an on-shell relation of type (1) is certainly\nplausible, at least if l is indeed of the order of the inverse of the Planck scale, for microscopic particles, the same on-shell\nrelation, even taking l as the inverse of the Planck scale, is unacceptable for macroscopic bodies composed of very many\nmicro-particles. The Planck-scale is huge by the standards of elementary particles but is actually a small scale (\u223c 10\u22125 grams)\nfor macroscopic bodies, and as a result, unless there is a suppression of the type shown in Eq. (2), the DSR description of\nmacroscopic bodies could be disastrous.\nSo there is technical evidence of the fact that composite particles should have DSR-relativistic properties different from\nthose of their constituents, with weaker deformation effects, and this is much welcome from the point of view of reproducing\nthe observed properties of macroscopic bodies. But this encouraging correspondence between features for composite (particles\nand) bodies found on the theory side and our desiderata for the phenomenology of macroscopic bodies has also provided a\nformidable challenge for DSR research: if composite particles (and macroscopic bodies) have relativistic properties which\nare different from the ones of their constituents then these DSR-relativistic theories should be theories that do not prescribe\n\"universal\" laws of kinematics but rather particle-dependent ones!!\nIs that even possible?\nCan a theory be fully relativistic and yet attribute different laws of kinematics to different particles?\nThese questions have remained so far unanswered.\nI shall here show that the correct answer is yes: there are logically consistent DSR-relativistic theories in which different\nparticles (possibly \"elementary\" and \"composite\" particles) are governed by different laws of kinematics.\nAfter a brief reminder, in the next Sec. II, of the basic logical structure of DSR-relativistic theories, I set the stage for\nmy analysis, in Sec. III, by reviewing in some detail the relativistic kinematics of a much studied DSR framework. This is\nof course still a standard \"universal\" DSR framework, but a rather sophisticated possibility. My attitude here is not one of\nestablishing the validity of general theorems, so the strength of my results is primarily exhibited in terms of the fact that I\ncan take as starting point a rather sophisticated \"universal\" DSR framework. The fact that I am able to generalize such a\nframework to a \"non-universal\" version (with particle-type-dependent effects) suggests that such generalizations might be\neven easier when taking as starting point simpler \"universal\" DSR scenarios.\nA first group of new results is reported in Sec. IV, where I show that one can combine in the same relativistic theory particles\nwith standard special-relativistic properties and particles with DSR-deformed relativistic properties. The key ingredient of this\nresult is a \"mixing composition law\" suitable for writing a DSR-covariant law of conservation of momentum for processes\ninvolving different particles with different relativistic properties, and such that the covariance is assured by a suitably adapted\naction of boost generators on multiparticle systems.\nI then show, in Sec. V, that one can combine in the same relativistic theory two species of particles; one with some given\nDSR-deformed relativistic properties and the other with some other DSR-deformed relativistic properties. I verify that this is\npossible at least in cases such that the DSR deformation has the same formalization for the two types of particles, but with\ndifferent magnitude. I introduce for this purpose a further generalization of the \"mixing composition law\" and of the laws of\naction of boost generators on multiparticle systems.\nThe new formulation of relativistic kinematics introduced in Secs. IV and V is most simply viewed from the perspective\nof applications to different types of particles (some \"elementary\" and some \"composite\"), but I also explore, in Sec. VI,\nthe possibility that the laws characterized by weaker DSR deformation apply to a macroscopic body. I find preliminary\nencouragement for such a possible application.\nThen, in Sec. VII, I consider the possibility of applications of the formulation of relativistic kinematics here introduced to\nthe case of different types of elementary particles, establishing a few first points relevant for the phenomenology. As a way to\nillustrate more vividly the content of this possible application I use as \"conceptual laboratory\" the neutrino-superluminalityanomaly recently tentatively reported by the OPERA collaboration [10].\nIn the brief Sec. VIII I comment on the type of spacetime-symmetry algebra which could provide the formal/mathematical\ncounterpart for the version of relativistic kinematics I here introduce. In this respect perhaps most notably I argue that a\n\n\f4\nsuitable generalization of the Hopf-algebra notion of co-product, something of the sort of a \"mixing co-product\", could be\ninspired by the \"mixing composition laws\" I here introduced.\nI work throughout at leading order in the deformation scale l (with l that can be both positive and negative, in the sense than\nboth scenarios with l/|l| = 1 and scenarios with l/|l| = \u22121 are admissible). This keeps formulas at reasonably manageable\nlevel, sufficiently characterizes the new concepts, and would be fully sufficient for phenomenology if indeed the deformation\nscale is roughly of the order of the huge Planck scale (in which case a leading-order analysis should be all we need for\ncomparison to data we could realistically imagine to gather over the next few decades).\nHowever, in Sec. IX, I do offer a small aside contemplating possible generalizations of my results to \"all-order analyses\".\nSome speculations about possible future developments are offered in the brief closing Sec. X.\nI mostly focus on 1+1-dimensional cases, where all conceptual issues here relevant are already present and can be exposed\nmore simply. Therefore my momenta will often have two components, {p0 , p1 }, and when I briefly switch to consider cases\nwith more dimensions I will use the notation {p0 , p j }.\nII.\n\nDSR-DEFORMATIONS OF LORENTZ SYMMETRY\n\nBefore proceeding with the main part of the analysis, let me pause briefly, in this section, for summarizing the main points\noriginally made in Ref. [1] concerning the consistency requirements that the relativity of inertial frames imposes on the\nrelationship between the form of the on-shell(/dispersion) relation and the form of laws of energy-momentum conservation.\nThis is one of the most used DSR concepts, and plays a pivotal role in the analysis I report in the following sections.\nThis consistency between on-shell relation and laws of momentum conservation that follows from insisting on the relativity\nof inertial frames is also rather significant from the perspective of studies of the quantum-gravity problem, where in some cases\none finds \"preliminary theoretical evidence\" of modifications of the on-shell relation but usually not accompanied so far by\nany information on whether or not there should also be modifications of the law of conservation of momentum. Indeed the idea\nof DSR-deformed Lorentz transformations was put forward [1] as a possible description of certain preliminary theory results\nsuggesting that there might be violations of some special-relativistic laws in certain approaches to the quantum-gravity problem, most notably the ones based on spacetime noncommutativity and loop quantum gravity. The part of the quantum-gravity\ncommunity interested in those results was interpreting them as a manifestation of a full breakdown of Lorentz symmetry,\nwith the emergence of a preferred class of observers (an \"ether\"). But it was argued in Ref. [1] that departures from Special\nRelativity governed by a high-energy/short-distance scale may well be compatible with the Relativity Principle, the principle\nof relativity of inertial observers, at the cost of allowing some consistent modifications of the Poincar\u00e9 transformations, and\nparticularly of the Lorentz-boost transformations. And it was already observed in Ref. [1] that this in turn would require\ncorresponding modifications of the laws of momentum conservation.\nAs mentioned above, the DSR proposal could provide [1] a conceptual path for pursuing a broader class of scenarios of\ninterest for fundamental physics, and in particular for quantum-gravity research, including the possibility of introducing the\nsecond observer-independent scale primitively in spacetime structure or primitively at the level of the (deformed) de Broglie\nrelation between wavelength and momentum. However, the bulk of the preliminary results from quantum-gravity research\nconcern departures from the special-relativistic on-shell relation, and this in turn became the main focus of DSR research.\nSo let me consider a generic on-shell relation of the type\nm2 = p20 \u2212 p2 + \u2206(E, p; l)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u2206 is the deformation and l is the deformation scale.\nEvidently when \u2206 6= 0 such an on-shell relation (3) is not Lorentz invariant. If we insist on this law and on the validity of\nclassical (undeformed) Lorentz transformations between inertial observers we clearly end up with a preferred-frame picture,\nand the Principle of Relativity of inertial frames must be abandoned: the scale l cannot be observer independent, and actually\nthe whole form of (3) is subject to vary from one class of inertial observers to another.\nFrom the alternative DSR perspective one would have to enforce the relativistic invariance of laws such as (3), preserving the\n\n\f5\nrelativity of inertial frames, at the cost of modifying the action of boosts on momenta. Then in such theories both the velocity\nscale c (here mute only because of the choice of dimensions) and the length/inverse-momentum scale l play the same role [1]\nof invariant scales of the relativistic theory which govern the form of boost transformations.\nSeveral examples of boost deformations adapted in the DSR sense to modified on-shell relations have been analyzed in some\ndetail (see e.g. Refs. [1\u20137] and references therein). Clearly these DSR-deformed boosts N j must be such that\n[N j , p20 \u2212 p2 + \u2206(E, p; M\u2217 )] = 0 .\n\n(4)\n\nThis requirement (4) of DSR-relativity is completely analogous to the corresponding ones of Galilean Relativity and Special\nRelativity: of course in all these cases the on-shell relation is boost invariant (but respectively under Galilean boosts, Lorentz\nboosts, and DSR-deformed Lorentz boosts); for Special Relativity the action of boosts evidently must depend on the speed\nscale c and boosts must act non-linearly on velocities (since they must enforce observer-independence of c-dependent laws),\nand for DSR relativity the action of boosts evidently must depend on both the scale c and the scale l, with boosts acting\nnon-linearly both on velocities and momenta, since it must enforce observer-independence of c-dependent and l-dependent\nlaws.\nActually much of the logical structure of the conjectured transition from Special Relativity to a DSR theory can be understood in analogy with the transition from Galilean Relativity to Special relativity. Famously, as the Maxwell formulation\nof electromagnetism, with an observer-independent speed scale \"c\", gained more and more experimental support (among\nwhich one should count the Michelson-Morley results) it became clear that Galilean relativistic symmetries could no longer\nbe upheld. From a modern perspective we should see the pre-Einsteinian attempts to address that crisis (such as the ones of\nLorentz) as attempts to \"break Galilean invariance\", i.e. preserve the validity of Galilean transformations as laws of transformation among inertial observers, but renouncing to the possibility that those transformations be a symmetry of the laws of\nphysics. The \"ether\" would be a preferred frame for the description of the laws of physics, and the laws of physics that hold\nin other frames would be obtained from the ones of the preferred frame via Galilean transformations. Those attempts failed.\nWhat succeeded is completely complementary. Experimental evidence, and the analyses of Einstein (and Poincar\u00e9) led us\nto a \"deformation of Galilean invariance\": in Special Relativity the laws of transformation among observers still are a symmetry of the laws of physics (Special Relativity is no less relativistic then Galilean Relativity), but the special-relativistic\ntransformation laws are a c-deformation of the Galilean laws of transformation with the special property of achieving the\nobserver-independence of the speed scale c.\n2\nThis famous c-deformation\np in particular replaces the Galilean on-shell relation E = constant + p /(2m) with the special2\n2\n4\n2\nrelativistic version E = c p + c m and the Galilean composition of velocities u \u2295 v = u + v with the much more complex\nspecial-relativistic law of composition of velocities.\nThis interplay between c-deformation of Galilean transformations and the associated deformations of the law of composition\nof velocities, is analogous to the interplay between the DSR-type l-deformation of Lorentz transformations and the associated\ndeformations of the law of composition of momenta.\nIII. A KNOWN EXAMPLE OF DSR SETUP WITH UNIVERSALITY\n\nI shall now give more tangibility to the brief review of DSR concepts contained in the previous section, by discussing a\nknown DSR setup and highlighting the connection between deformation of the on-shell relation and deformation of the laws\nof momentum conservation.\nThe specific DSR setup reviewed in this section will also provide the starting point for the generalization introduced in this\nmanuscript. The one that I review in this section, following mainly the results of Ref. [11], still is a standard DSR setup with\n\"universal effects\", i.e. the deformation of Lorentz symmetry affects all particles in exactly the same way. Then in the next\nsections I will take the DSR setup of this section as starting point for adding the possibility of \"nonuniversal effects\", i.e. cases\nwhere the deformation of Lorentz symmetry affects different types of particles in different ways.\nThe DSR setup on which I focus in this section was analyzed from the perspective here relevant in the recent Ref. [11],\nand more preliminarily in previous DSR studies (some comments on it were already in Ref. [1]). It is centered on a choice of\n\n\f6\non-shell relation and law of composition of momenta which became recently of interest[12, 13] also in the study of the new\nproposal of \"relative-locality momentum spaces\" [14, 15], and provides a set of rules for kinematics which can be naturally\ndescribed from the viewpoint of the \u03ba-Poincar\u00e9 Hopf algebra [16, 17].\nThe on-shell (\"dispersion\") relation is (for the 1+1-dimensional case)\nm2 = p20 \u2212 p21 + lp0 p21\n\n(5)\n\n(p \u2295l p\u2032 )1 = p1 + p\u20321 + lp0 p\u20321 , (p \u2295l p\u2032 )0 = p0 + p\u20320 .\n\n(6)\n\nand the law of composition of momenta is\n\nThe on-shell relation (5) is invariant under the following action of a boost on the momentum of a particle:\nl\n[N, p0 ] = p1 , [N, p1 ] = p0 + lp20 + p21 ,\n2\n\n(7)\n\nl\n[N, p20 \u2212 p21 + lp0 p21 ] = 2p0 p1 \u2212 2p1(p0 + lp20 + p21 ) + lp31 + 2lp20 p1 = 0\n2\n\n(8)\n\nwhich indeed ensures\n\nIn light of the points highlighted in the brief review of DSR concepts offered in the previous section it should be clear that this\ninvariance of the on-shell relation would not in itself establish the DSR-compatibility of this setup: we must also insist that\nthe laws of conservation of momentum, written using the composition law (6), are covariant under the action of the boosts\nthat leave the on-shell relation invariant.\nAnd this requirement of covariance of conservation laws is rather challenging when the law of composition of momenta is noncommutative, as in the case of (6). I am not advocating that the law of composition of momenta should be non-commutative;\non the contrary one may well prefer [11] commutative laws of composition of momenta in a DSR setup. But part of the\nstrength of the results I am here reporting resides in the fact that I am able to generalize to \"nonuniversal DSR deformations\"\nnot merely a particularly simple DSR setup previously known with universality, but actually a rather virulent DSR setup,\nwhich in particular relies on a noncommutative law of composition of momenta. This should reassure my readers of the fact\nthat the new structures I introduce in this manuscript should allow to produce non-universal versions of a rather large variety\nof DSR setups.\nHowever, as stressed and addressed in Ref. [11], the non-commutativity of the composition law (6) evidently poses a\nchallenge for formulating the action of boosts on momenta obtained composing two or more single-particle momenta. In\nSpecial Relativity (and in DSR setups with commutative law of composition of momenta [11]) it is possible to simply impose\nthat the boost of a two-particle event e p\u2295l p\u2032 be governed by\n[N[p] + N[p\u2032] , p \u2295l p\u2032 ]\nwhere I decomposed the action of boosts on the composed momentum into two pieces, each given in terms of a boost acting\nexclusively on a certain momentum in the event.\nThis means that in Special Relativity one has a \"total boost generator\" obtained by combining trivially the boost generators\nacting on each individual particle. But with a noncommutative law of composition of momenta this simplicity is lost: the\nlack of symmetry under exchange of particles precludes, as one can easily verify, the possibility of adopting a \"total boost\ngenerator\" given by a trivial sum of single-particle boost generators. There is in particular no choice [11] of N[p] capable of\nensuring that [N[p] + N[p\u2032] + N[p\u2032\u2032] , (p \u2295l p\u2032 \u2295l p\u2032\u2032 )\u03bc ] vanishes whenever (p \u2295l p\u2032 \u2295l p\u2032\u2032 )\u03bc = 0.\nWhat does work, as shown in Ref. [11], is adopting a corresponding deformation of the \"total-boost law\"\nN[p\u2295l p\u2032 ] = N[p] + N[p\u2032 ] + lp0N[p\u2032 ]\n\n(9)\n\n\f7\nand accordingly\nN[p\u2295l p\u2032 \u2295l p\u2032\u2032 ] = N[p] + N[p\u2032 ] + N[p\u2032\u2032 ] + lp0N[p\u2032 ] + lp0N[p\u2032\u2032 ] + lp\u20320N[p\u2032\u2032 ] .\n\n(10)\n\nIn Ref. [11] I verified in some detail that this prescription produces a fully consistent relativistic framework, with the needed\ncompatibility between on-shell relation (5) and law of composition of momenta (6): the on-shell relation is invariant and the\nlaws of conservation of momentum obtained from the composition law are covariant.\nLet me here just review briefly the specific result of Ref. [11] concerning the covariance of the conservation law for a \"trivalent\nprocess\" with2 p \u2295l p\u2032 \u2295l p\u2032\u2032 = 0.\nChecking that N[p] + N[p\u2032 ] + N[p\u2032\u2032 ] + lp0N[p\u2032 ] + lp0 N[p\u2032\u2032 ] + lp\u20320N[p\u2032\u2032 ] does indeed ensure the relativistic covariance of the conservation law p \u2295l p\u2032 \u2295l p\u2032\u2032 = 0 is best done considering separately the 0 (\"time\") component and the spatial 1 (\"spatial\")\ncomponent. For the 0 component one easily finds [11]\n[N[p] + N[p\u2032 ] + N[p\u2032\u2032 ] + lp0 N[p\u2032 ] + lp0N[p\u2032\u2032 ] + lp\u20320N[p\u2032\u2032 ] , (p \u2295l p\u2032 \u2295l p\u2032\u2032 )0 ] =\n= [N[p] + N[p\u2032] + N[p\u2032\u2032] + lp0N[p\u2032 ] + lp0N[p\u2032\u2032 ] + lp\u20320N[p\u2032\u2032 ] , p0 + p\u20320 + p\u2032\u20320 ] =\n= p1 + p\u20321 + p\u2032\u20321 + lp0 p\u20321 + lp0 p\u2032\u20321 + lp\u20320 p\u2032\u20321 = (p \u2295l p\u2032 \u2295l p\u2032\u2032 )1 = 0 ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere on the right-hand side I of course used the conservation law itself.\nSimilarly for the 1 component one easily finds that [11]\n[N[p] + N[p\u2032] + N[p\u2032\u2032] + lp0N[p\u2032 ] + lp0N[p\u2032\u2032 ] + lp\u20320 N[p\u2032\u2032 ] , (p \u2295l p\u2032 \u2295l p\u2032\u2032 )1 ] =\n= [N[p] + N[p\u2032] + N[p\u2032\u2032] + lp0N[p\u2032 ] + lp0N[p\u2032\u2032 ] + lp\u20320 N[p\u2032\u2032 ] , p1 + p\u20321 + p\u2032\u20321 + lp0 p\u20321 + lp0 p\u2032\u20321 + lp\u20320 p\u2032\u20321 ] =\nl\nl\nl\n= p0 + lp20 + p21 + p\u20320 + lp\u203202 + p\u203212 + p\u2032\u20320 + lp\u2032\u20320 2 + p\u2032\u20321 2 + 2lp0 p\u20320 + 2lp0 p\u2032\u20320 + 2lp\u20320 p\u2032\u20320 + lp1 p\u20321 + lp1 p\u2032\u20321 + lp\u20321 p\u2032\u20321 =\n2\n2\n2\nl\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032 2\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032 2\n(12)\n= p0 + p0 + p0 + l(p0 + p0 + p0 ) + (p1 + p1 + p1 ) = 0\n2\nwhere again on the right-hand side I used the conservation law p \u2295l p\u2032 \u2295l p\u2032\u2032 = 0 itself, and I took again into account that I am\nworking at leading order in l.\nThe results (11) and (12) establish that indeed the boosts (7),(9)(10), besides admitting the on-shell relation (5) as invariant,\nalso admit p \u2295l p\u2032 \u2295l p\u2032\u2032 = 0 as a covariant law.\nIV. A FIRST EXAMPLE OF DSR SETUP WITHOUT UNIVERSALITY\n\nThe previous sections only provided the preliminaries for the main analysis that I report in this manuscript, which is\ncontained in this and the next section. It was a rather bulky effort on preliminaries, but I felt this might be beneficial since the\nresults I am reporting are to a large extent suprising/unexpected and it might be helpful for my readers to be equipped with a\nnearly self-contained summary of the previous results which provide the starting point for the analysis I am here reporting. As\nannounced, I am going to show that there are logically consistent DSR-relativistic theories in which different types of particles\n\n2\n\nThroughout this manuscript I write conservation laws at a process with conventions such that all momenta intervening in the process are incoming\ninto the process, so that indeed a trivalent process would be characterized by a conservation law of the type p \u2295l p\u2032 \u2295l p\u2032\u2032 = 0. The case of one\n(or two) of the momenta that is outgoing from the process, say the momentum p, is recovered by simply substituting for p the \"antipode\" of the\nmomentum of that outgoing particle, with the antipode \u2296p defined so that (\u2296p) \u2295 p = 0. [For the composition law (6) the antipode is such that\n(\u2296l p) j = \u2212p j + lp0 p j and (\u2296l p)0 = \u2212p0 .]\n\n\f8\nare governed by different laws of kinematics.\nIn this section I start by establishing that the type of particle discussed in the previous section, governed by a specific DSR\nl-deformation of Lorentz symmetry, can coexist with a second type of particle, governed by ordinary Special Relativity.\nThe key point will be to show that there are laws of conservation of momentum allowing momentum to be exchanged between\nthe two types of particles3 in a fully relativistic manner.\nI shall consistently denote with p (or p\u2032 or p\u2032\u2032 ...) the momenta of the type of particles affected by the DSR l-deformation\nof Lorentz symmetry discussed in the previous section, so that in particular\nm2 = p20 \u2212 p2j + lp0 p2j .\n\n(13)\n\nAnd I shall consistently denote with k (or k\u2032 or k\u2032\u2032 ...) the momenta of particles of the second type, the type governed by\nundeformed Special Relativity, so that in particular\n\u03bc2 = k02 \u2212 k2j\n\n(14)\n\nFor the first type (\"p-type\") of particles I shall insist again on\nl\n[N[p] , p0 ] = p1 , [N[p] , p1 ] = p0 + lp20 + p21 ,\n2\n\n(15)\n\nwhile naturally, for the second type (\"k-type\") of particles, I take\n[N[k] , k0 ] = k1 , [N[k] , k1 ] = k0 .\n\n(16)\n\nAnd naturally the composition law for the special-relativistic momenta (\"k-type\") is standard,\n(k \u2295\u22c6 k\u2032 ) j = k j + k\u2032j , (k \u2295\u22c6 k\u2032 )0 = k0 + k0\u2032 ,\n\n(17)\n\nwhereas the composition law for the l-deformed (\"p-type\") particles was already introduced in the previous section:\n(p \u2295l p\u2032 ) j = p j + p\u2032j + lp0 p\u2032j , (p \u2295l p\u2032 )0 = p0 + p\u20320 .\n\n(18)\n\nIt is easy to see that the main challenge resides in finding a consistent way to compose momenta of different types, i.e.\nfinding some \"mixing composition law\", of the type p \u2295l\u22c6 k, while insisting that conservation laws written in terms of such a\ncomposition law would be covariant under a consistent prescription for the action of boosts. Equipped with no theorem, but\nrather the findings of a lengthy \"trial and error exercise\" I can simply exhibit an example of such a \"mixing composition law\"\nwhich does work, and it is remarkably simple:\nl\n(p \u2295l\u22c6 k) j = p j + k j + p0 k j , (p \u2295l,\u22c6 k)0 = p0 + k0 .\n2\n\n(19)\n\nIn order to convince my readers that this does work let me start slowly, focusing at first on \"bi-valent processes\" in this\ntheory with two types of particles. Some of these bi-valent processes, the ones without \"mixing\", will pose no challenge:\nprocesses with conservation law k \u2295\u22c6 k\u2032 = 0 will have covariance ensured by standard total-boost actions\nN[k\u2295\u22c6 k\u2032 ] = N[k] + N[k\u2032 ]\n\n3\n\n(20)\n\nIf the two types of particles could not interact then they would actually not \"coexist\": the \"Universe\" of l-deformed particles would remain decoupled from\n(undetectable and irrelevant for) the \"Universe\" of l-deformed particles, and vice versa.\n\n\f9\nwhile processes with conservation law p \u2295l p\u2032 = 0 will have covariance ensured by the total-boost actions discussed in the\nprevious section\nN[p\u2295l p\u2032 ] = N[p] + N[p\u2032 ] + lp0 N[p\u2032 ] .\n\n(21)\n\nThe only class of bi-valent processes which involves \"mixing\" is the one of processes with conservation law of the type\np \u2295l\u22c6 k = 0. In light of the discussion offered in the previous section it should not be too surprising that a relativistically\nconsistent description of such \"mixing bi-valent processes\" is obtained in terms of a total-boost action which itself involves a\nsort of \"mixing\":\nl\nN[p\u2295l\u22c6 k] = N[p] + N[k] + p0 N[k] .\n(22)\n2\nLet us verify that indeed this total-boost action ensure the covariance of the conservation law p \u2295l\u22c6 k = 0. I start again from\nthe 0 component of p \u2295l\u22c6 k = 0 for which I find\nl\nl\n[N[p] + N[k] + p0 N[k] , k0 + p0 ] = p1 + k1 + p0 k1 = (p \u2295l\u22c6 k)1 = 0\n2\n2\nwhere on the right-hand side I of course used again the conservation law itself.\nSimilarly for the 1 component of p \u2295l\u22c6 k = 0 I find\n\n(23)\n\nl\nl\nl\nl\n(24)\n[N[p] + N[k] + p0 N[k] , p1 + k1 + p0 k1 ] = p0 + lp20 + p21 + k0 + p1 k1 + lp0 k0 =\n2\n2\n2\n2\nl\n= p0 + k0 + lp0(p0 + k0) + p1 (p1 + k1) = 0\n2\nwhere again on the right-hand side I used the conservation law p \u2295l\u22c6 k = 0 and took again into account that I am working at\nleading order in l. [Working at leading order in l one finds, e.g., lp1 [(p \u2295l\u22c6 k)1 ] \u2243 lp1 [p1 + k1 ].]\nSo I did find that my description of boosts and of the composition laws \u2295l\u22c6 , \u2295l , \u2295\u22c6 ensures the covariance of conservation\nlaws for all \"bi-valent processes\".\nI can now move on to the case of tri-valent processes. The covariance of the kinematics of processes with k \u2295\u22c6 k\u2032 \u2295\u22c6 k\u2032\u2032 = 0\nand p \u2295l p\u2032 \u2295l p\u2032\u2032 = 0 is assured respectively by Special Relativity and by the results reviewed in the previous section. Of\ncourse the only potentially troublesome tri-valent processes are the ones whose conservation laws involve \"mixing\", which\nleads me to focus on the cases p \u2295l p\u2032 \u2295l\u22c6 k = 0 and p \u2295l\u22c6 k \u2295\u22c6 k\u2032 = 0.\nIn order to show that these \"tri-valent mixing conservation laws\" are covariant under the action of the boosts\nl\nN[p] + N[p\u2032 ] + N[k] + lp0N[p\u2032 ] + (p0 + p\u20320 )N[k]\n2\nlet me start from the 0 component of p \u2295l p\u2032 \u2295l\u22c6 k = 0, for which I easily find the expected result\nl\nl\n[N[p] + N[p\u2032 ] + N[k] + lp0N[p\u2032 ] + (p0 + p\u20320)N[k] , p0 + p\u20320 + k0 ] = p1 + p\u20321 + k1 + lp0 p\u20321 + (p0 + p\u20320 )k1 =\n2\n2\n= (p \u2295l p\u2032 \u2295l\u22c6 k)1 = 0\nAlso successful is the verification for the 1 component of p \u2295l\n\np\u2032 \u2295\n\nl\u22c6 k\n\n(25)\n\n= 0, which progresses as follows:\n\nl\nl\n[N[p] + N[p\u2032] + N[k] + lp0 N[p\u2032 ] + (p0 + p\u20320)N[k] , p1 + p\u20321 + k1 + lp0 p\u20321 + (p0 + p\u20320 )k1 ] =\n2\n2\nl 2\nl \u20322\n2\n\u2032\n\u20322\n= p0 + lp0 + p1 + p0 + lp0 + p1 + k0 +\n2\n2\nl\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n+lp1 p1 + 2lp0 p0 + (p1 + p1 )k1 + l(p0 + p\u20320 )k0 =\n2\nl\n\u2032\n= p0 + p0 + k0 + l(p0 + p\u20320)(p0 + p\u20320 + k0 ) + (p1 + p\u20321 )(p1 + p\u20321 + k1 ) = 0\n2\n\n(26)\n\n\f10\nHaving done this it is not hard to adapt the results I obtained for p \u2295l p\u2032 \u2295l\u22c6 k = 0 to the only slightly different case of\np \u2295l\u22c6 k \u2295\u22c6 k\u2032 = 0. In order to establish also the covariance of p \u2295l\u22c6 k \u2295\u22c6 k\u2032 = 0 let me start again with its 0 component, for\nwhich I easily find a satisfactory result:\nl\nl\n[N[p] + N[k] + N[k\u2032 ] + p0 (N[k] + N[k\u2032 ] ), p0 + k0 + k0\u2032 ] = p1 + k1 + k1\u2032 + p0 (k1 + k1\u2032 ) =\n2\n2\n= (p \u2295l\u22c6 k \u2295\u22c6 k\u2032 )1 = 0\n\n(27)\n\nAnd equally satisfactory is the corresponding verification for the 1-component of p \u2295l,\u03bb k \u2295\u03bb k\u2032 = 0 which progresses as\nfollows:\nl\nl\n[N[p] + N[k] + N[k\u2032 ] + p0 (N[k] + N[k\u2032 ] ), p1 + k1 + k1\u2032 + p0 (k1 + k1\u2032 )] =\n2\n2\nl\nl\n= p0 + lp20 + p21 + k0 + k0\u2032 + p1 (k1 + k1\u2032 ) + lp0(k0 + k0\u2032 ) =\n2\n2\nl\n(28)\n= p0 + k0 + k0\u2032 + p1 (p1 + k1 + k1\u2032 ) + lp0(p0 + k0 + k0\u2032 ) = 0\n2\nSo I did show that there is at least one (and surely many more) example of \"mixing interaction\" which satisfies the demands\nof the relativity of inertial frames, producing rules of relativistic kinematics with a consistent description of interactions\namong particles with different relativistic properties: the results (25), (26), (27), (28) confirm that the boosts I introduced in\n(15), (16), (20), (21), (22), besides admitting the on-shell relations (13),(14) as invariants, also admit the conservation laws\np \u2295l p\u2032 \u2295l p\u2032\u2032 = 0 and p \u2295l\u22c6 k \u2295\u22c6 k\u2032 = 0 as covariant laws.\nThis establishes that it is possible to have meaningful (interacting) theories that are fully relativistic in spite of allowing for\nthe coexistence of a type of particle whose relativistic properties are governed by ordinary Special Relativity and of a type\nof particle whose relativistic properties are governed by the type of DSR l-deformation of Lorentz symmetry reviewed in the\nprevious section.\nV. FROM HOPF-LIE TO HOPF-HOPF\n\nThe new results reported in the previous section establish a possibility for coexistence of DSR-relativistic and ordinarily\nspecial-relativistic particles. As I shall stress in later parts of this manuscript, this should also invite (in addition to possibly\nother schemes of mathematical implementation) the development of mathematical structures suitable for \"mixing\" the structure of a non-trivial Hopf algebra and the structure of a (Hopf algebra with primitive coproducts, i.e. a) Lie algebra. I am\nnow going to report results that further generalize the realm of possibilities: the case of two types of particles, with both\ntypes governed by the specific DSR deformation of Lorentz symmetry reviewed in Sec. III, but one type of particle has DSR\ndeformation scale l while the other type of particle has DSR deformation scale \u03bb (so that one could describe the framework\nas mixing the \"Hopf-algebra properties\" of one type of particles with the somewhat different \"Hopf-algebra properties\" of\nanother type of particles). This will allow me, in later parts of this manuscript, to speculate about the possibility that \u03bb for\na \"composite particle\" might be obtained from l via some rescaling law possibly based on the number and nature of the\nconstituents (an illustrative example of which would be \u03bb = l/N, with the N the number of constituents).\nI shall consistently denote with p (or p\u2032 or p\u2032\u2032 ...) the momenta of the type of particles affected by the DSR l-deformation\nof Lorentz symmetry discussed Sec. III, so that in particular\nm2 = p20 \u2212 p2j + lp0 p2j\n\n(29)\n\nAnd I shall consistently denote with k (or k\u2032 or k\u2032\u2032 ...) the momenta of particles of the second type, the type with DSR\n\u03bb-deformation of Lorentz symmetry, so that in particular\n\u03bc2 = k02 \u2212 k2j + \u03bbk0 k2j\n\n(30)\n\n\f11\nOf course, for boosts acting on a single-particle momentum I will rely again on\nl\n[N[p] , p0 ] = p1 , [N[p] , p1 ] = p0 + lp20 + p21 ,\n2\n\n(31)\n\n\u03bb\n[N[k] , k0 ] = k1 , [N[k] , k1 ] = k0 + \u03bbk02 + k12 .\n2\n\n(32)\n\nand accordingly\n\nAnd also for the \"laws of composition without mixing\", p \u2295l p\u2032 and k \u2295\u03bb k\u2032 , everything is clear from the onset of the analysis:\n(p \u2295l p\u2032 ) j = p j + p\u2032j + lp0 p\u2032j , (p \u2295l p\u2032 )0 = p0 + p\u20320 .\n\n(33)\n\n(k \u2295\u03bb k\u2032 ) j = k j + k\u2032j + \u03bbk0k\u2032j , (k \u2295\u03bb k\u2032 )0 = k0 + k0\u2032 .\n\n(34)\n\nIn particular, this ensures again that processes involving only \"laws of composition without mixing\" will be described in\nconsistent relativistic manner by enforcing the \"laws of action of boosts without mixing\" which I already used above:\nN[p\u2295l p\u2032 ] = N[p] + N[p\u2032 ] + lp0 N[p\u2032 ]\nN[k\u2295\u03bb k\u2032 ] = N[k] + N[k\u2032 ] + \u03bbk0N[k\u2032 ]\nSo once again the main challenge resides in finding a consistent way to compose momenta of different types of particles, i.e.\nfinding some \"mixing composition law\" p \u2295l,\u03bb k, while insisting that conservation laws written in terms of such a composition\nlaw would be covariant under a consistent prescription for the action of boosts. Relying on the findings of a lengthy \"trial and\nerror exercise\" I can simply exhibit an example of such a \"mixing composition law\" which does work, and it is once again\nremarkably simple:\n(p \u2295l,\u03bb k) j = p j + k j +\n\nl+\u03bb\np0 k j , (p \u2295l,\u03bb k)0 = p0 + k0 .\n2\n\n(35)\n\nAnd I shall also show that the needed counterpart taking the shape of a \"mixing composition of boosts\" that leads to a\nconsistently relativistic description is given by\nN[p\u2295l,\u03bb k] = N[p] + N[k] +\n\nl+\u03bb\np0 N[k]\n2\n\nWith these characterizations I have completed the specifications of kinematics needed for the results being reported in this\nsection. I shall now proceed to deriving these results. Readers are invited to notice that all specifications and results given in\nthis section evidently reduce to the ones of the previous section in the limit \u03bb \u2192 0.\nLet us verify that indeed these boost actions ensure compatibility with the conservation laws obtained from the composition\nlaws \u2295l , \u2295\u03bb , and \u2295l,\u03bb . Actually for processes involving either exclusively \u2295l , or exclusively \u2295\u03bb the compatibility with my\ndeformed boosts was already verified in Sec. III. So I can focus on cases which involve at least one \u2295l,\u03bb. Looking first at\n\"bi-valent processes\" the only case of interest then evidently is p \u2295l,\u03bb k = 0. For the 0-th component of p \u2295l,\u03bb k = 0 one finds\n[N[p] + N[k] +\n\nl+\u03bb\nl+\u03bb\np0 N[k] , k0 + p0 ] = p1 + k1 +\np0 k1 = (p \u2295l,\u03bb k)1 = 0\n2\n2\n\n(36)\n\n\f12\nwhere on the right-hand side I of course used again the conservation law itself.\nSimilarly for the 1-component of p \u2295l,\u03bb k = 0 one finds\nl+\u03bb\nl+\u03bb\nl\n\u03bb\nl+\u03bb\np0 N[k] , p1 + k1 +\np0 k1 ] = p0 + lp20 + p21 + k0 + \u03bbk02 + k12 +\np1 k1 + (l + \u03bb)p0k0 =\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nl\u2212\u03bb 2\nl+\u03bb 2\nl+\u03bb 2\nl\u2212\u03bb 2\n(p0 \u2212 k02 ) +\n(p1 \u2212 k12 ) +\n(p0 + k02 + 2k0 p0 ) +\n(p1 + k12 + 2k1 p1 ) =\n(37)\n= p 0 + k0 +\n2\n4\n2\n4\nl\u2212\u03bb\nl+\u03bb\nl+\u03bb\nl\u2212\u03bb\n(p0 \u2212 k0 )(p0 + k0 ) +\n(p1 \u2212 k1)(p1 + k1 ) +\n(p0 + k0 )2 +\n(p1 + k1 )2 = 0\n= p 0 + k0 +\n2\n4\n2\n4\n\n[N[p] + N[k] +\n\nwhere again on the right-hand side I used the conservation law p \u2295l,\u03bb k = 0 and took again into account that I am working at\nleading order in l, \u03bb. [Working at leading order in l, \u03bb one finds (l + \u03bb)[(p \u2295l,\u03bb k)1 ]2 \u2243 (l + \u03bb)(p1 + k1 )2 and (l \u2212 \u03bb)(p1 \u2212\nk1 )(p \u2295l,\u03bb k)1 \u2243 (l \u2212 \u03bb)(p1 \u2212 k1)(p1 + k1 ).]\nSo I did find that my description of boosts (and of the composition laws \u2295l,\u03bb , \u2295l , \u2295\u03bb ) ensures the convariance of conservation laws for \"bi-valent processes\".\nI can now move on to the case of tri-valent processes. The covariance of the kinematics of processes with p \u2295l p\u2032 \u2295l p\u2032\u2032 = 0\nand k \u2295\u03bb k\u2032 \u2295\u03bb k\u2032\u2032 = 0 is already assured by the results here reviewed in Sec. III. I shall now verify that the formulation of boost\ntransformations here introduced affords me the covariance also of the cases with p \u2295l p\u2032 \u2295l,\u03bb k = 0 and p \u2295l,\u03bb k \u2295\u03bb k\u2032 = 0.\nLet me start from the 0-th component of p \u2295l p\u2032 \u2295l,\u03bb k = 0 for which I easily find the expected result\nl+\u03bb\nl+\u03bb\n(p0 + p\u20320)N[k] , p0 + p\u20320 + k0 ] = p1 + p\u20321 + k1 + lp0 p\u20321 +\n(p0 + p\u20320 )k1 =\n2\n2\n= (p \u2295l p\u2032 \u2295l,\u03bb k)1 = 0\n(38)\n\n[N[p] + N[p\u2032] + N[k] + lp0 N[p\u2032 ] +\n\nAlso successful, but slightly more tedious, is the verification of the covariance for the 1-component of p \u2295l p\u2032 \u2295l,\u03bb k = 0,\nwhich progresses as follows:\nl+\u03bb\nl+\u03bb\n(p0 + p\u20320)N[k] , p1 + p\u20321 + k1 + lp0 p\u20321 +\n(p0 + p\u20320)k1 ] =\n2\n2\nl\nl\n\u03bb\n= p0 + lp20 + p21 + p\u20320 + lp\u203202 + p\u203212 + k0 + \u03bbk02 + k12 +\n2\n2\n2\nl+\u03bb\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n(p1 + p1 )k1 + (l + \u03bb)(p0 + p\u20320)k0 =\n+lp1 p1 + 2lp0 p0 +\n2\nl\u2212\u03bb 2\nl\u2212\u03bb 2\nl\u2212\u03bb\n= p0 + p\u20320 + k0 +\n(p0 + p\u203202 \u2212 k02 ) +\n(p1 + p\u203212 \u2212 k12 ) + (l \u2212 \u03bb)p0 p\u20320 +\np1 p\u20321 +\n2\n4\n2\nl+\u03bb 2\nl+\u03bb\nl+\u03bb 2\n(p0 + p\u203202 + k02 ) +\n(p1 + p\u203212 + k12 ) + (l + \u03bb)(p0 p\u20320 + p0k0 + p\u20320k0 ) +\n(p1 p\u20321 + p1 k1 + p\u20321 k1 ) =\n+\n2\n4\n2\nl\u2212\u03bb\nl\u2212\u03bb\n(p0 + p\u20320 \u2212 k0 )(p0 + p\u20320 + k0 ) +\n(p1 + p\u20321 \u2212 k1 )(p1 + p\u20321 + k1) +\n= p0 + p\u20320 + k0 +\n2\n4\nl+\u03bb\nl+\u03bb\n+\n(p0 + p\u20320 + k0 )2 +\n(p1 + p\u20321 + k1)2 = 0\n(39)\n2\n4\n\n[N[p] + N[p\u2032] + N[k] + lp0 N[p\u2032 ] +\n\nHaving done this it is not hard to adapt the results I obtained for p \u2295l p\u2032 \u2295l,\u03bb k = 0 to the only slightly different case of\np \u2295l,\u03bb k \u2295\u03bb k\u2032 = 0. In order to establish also the covariance of p \u2295l,\u03bb k \u2295\u03bb k\u2032 = 0 let me start again with its 0-th component, for\nwhich I easily find a satisfactory result:\nl+\u03bb\nl+\u03bb\np0 (N[k] + N[k\u2032 ] ) + \u03bbk0N[k\u2032 ] , p0 + k0 + k0\u2032 ] = p1 + k1 + k1\u2032 +\np0 (k1 + k1\u2032 ) + \u03bbk0k1\u2032 =\n2\n2\n= (p \u2295l,\u03bb k \u2295\u03bb k\u2032 )1 = 0\n(40)\n\n[N[p] + N[k] + N[k\u2032 ] +\n\n\f13\nAnd equally satisfactory (but again slightly more tedious) is the corresponding verification for the 1-component of p \u2295l,\u03bb k \u2295\u03bb\nk\u2032 = 0 which progresses as follows:\nl+\u03bb\nl+\u03bb\np0 (N[k] + N[k\u2032 ] ) + \u03bbk0N[k\u2032 ] , p1 + k1 + k1\u2032 +\np0 (k1 + k1\u2032 ) + \u03bbk0k1\u2032 ] =\n2\n2\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\nl\n= p0 + lp20 + p21 + k0 + \u03bbk02 + k12 + k0\u2032 + \u03bbk0\u2032 2 + k1\u2032 2 +\n2\n2\n2\nl+\u03bb\n+\np1 (k1 + k1\u2032 ) + (l + \u03bb)p0(k0 + k0\u2032 ) + \u03bbk1k1\u2032 + 2\u03bbk0k0\u2032 =\n2\n\u03bb\u2212l 2\n\u03bb\u2212l \u2032\n\u03bb\u2212l 2\n(k0 + k0\u2032 2 \u2212 p20 ) +\n(k1 + k1\u2032 2 \u2212 p21 ) + (\u03bb \u2212 l)k0k0\u2032 +\nk1 k1 +\n= p0 + k0 + p\u20320 +\n2\n4\n2\nl+\u03bb 2\nl+\u03bb 2\nl+\u03bb\n+\n(p0 + k02 + k0\u2032 2 ) +\n(p1 + k12 + k1\u2032 2 ) + (l + \u03bb)(p0k0 + p0 k0\u2032 + k0\u2032 k0 ) +\n(p1 k1 + p1 k1\u2032 + k1\u2032 k1 ) =\n2\n4\n2\n\u03bb\u2212l\n\u03bb\u2212l\n(k0 + k0\u2032 \u2212 p0 )(k0 + k0\u2032 + p0 ) +\n(k1 + k1\u2032 \u2212 p1)(k1 + k1\u2032 + p1 ) +\n= p0 + k0 + p\u20320 +\n2\n4\nl+\u03bb\nl+\u03bb\n(p0 + k0 + k0\u2032 )2 +\n(p1 + k1 + k1\u2032 )2 = 0\n(41)\n+\n2\n4\n\n[N[p] + N[k] + N[k\u2032 ] +\n\nSo I did manage to establish that it is possible to have meaningful (interacting) theories that are fully relativistic in spite of\nallowing for the coexistence of a type of particle whose relativistic properties are governed by a DSR l-deformation of Lorentz\nsymmetry and of a type of particle whose relativistic properties are governed by a DSR \u03bb-deformation of Lorentz symmetry.\nVI. COMPOSITE PARTICLES AND POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR MACROSCOPIC BODIES\n\nThe main result I am here announcing is contained in the previous two sections. In the remainder of this manuscript my\nonly objective is to show that the new class of DSR-relativistic theories introduced in the previous two sections may have\napplication in quite a few different physical pictures:\n(i) It could evidently be used to describe pictures in which different \"elementary/fundamental\" particles have different relativistic properties.\n(ii) It could also be used to describe pictures in which all \"elementary/fundamental\" particles have the same DSR-deformed\nrelativistic properties, but \"composite microscopic particles\", such as atoms (because of the known mechanisms mentioned in\nSection I) have different relativistic properties, with weaker deformation of special-relativistic properties than the fundamental\nparticles that compose them.\n(ii) And perhaps it could also be used to describe pictures in which microscopic particles have DSR-deformed relativistic\nproperties, but macroscopic bodies (again because of the known mechanisms mentioned in Section I) have ordinary specialrelativistic properties.\nFor cases (i) and (ii), assuming indeed |l|\u22121 is of the order of the Planck scale the new class of DSR-relativistic theories\nintroduced in the previous two sections certainly provides plausible physical pictures, since for microscopic particles (even\nfor atoms) the Planck scale is a gigantic scale and all effects of DSR deformation amount to small corrections.\nThe physical picture of case (iii) instead does not look too promising: even for this case (iii) the fact that I have shown here\nhow different relativistic properties can coexist is a significant step forward, but for macroscopic bodies the Planck scale is\nactually a small energy scale and there is therefore the risk of predicting hugely unrealistic effects. It is also for this reason\nthat so far the most popular way to handle macroscopic bodies in DSR research has been (see, e.g., Refs. [3, 9]) the one of\nrenouncing to the introduction of direct interactions between macroscopic and microscopic particles: the interaction between\na macroscopic particle could be of course also described in terms of the microscopic interactions involving the constituents of\nthe macroscopic body.\n\n\f14\nIt may well be the case that in spite of the option I managed to produce in the previous two sections one should still proceed in this way. But it is no longer so obvious that this should be the case: in this section I am going to report a simple\nderivation which provides encouragement for the possibility of allowing direct interactions between microscopic particles and\nmacroscopic bodies (without needing to decompose such interactions in terms of the microscopic interactions between the\nmicroscopic particle and the constituents of the macroscopic body).\nThe simple derivation I am reporting does not establish anything of general validity, but it does show that at least some of\nthe derivations which could turn pathological with a DSR description of macroscopic bodies actually do not.\nThis simple derivation concerns an elastic collision between an elementary particle and a macroscopic body\ne\u2212 + X \u2192 e\u2212 + X\nwhere e\u2212 stands for any elementary particle (e.g. an electron) governed by a DSR-relativistic description of the type in Sec. III\np0 = p +\n\nm2 l 2\n\u2212 p\n2p 2\n\n(42)\n\nwhile X is a macroscopic body of large mass M (M > |l|\u22121 ) in a nonrelativistic regime but possibly with large spatial momentum k (|l|\u22121 < k \u226a M)\nk0 = M +\n\nk2\n2M\n\n(43)\n\nSince I am considering M > |l|\u22121 (and k > |l|\u22121 ) one might fear that this elastic scattering might give pathological results,\nsuch as a huge transfer of momentum (of order, e.g. lk) from the macroscopic body to the micro particle. But this is not what\nthe formalization I developed in the previous two sections predicts.\nIn seeing this the nontrivial point of the derivation is of course the \"mixing composition law\" which I introduced in Sec. IV.\nThe process I am here considering has two incoming and two outgoing particles, so it must be written in terms of two antipodes\n(see Ref. [11] and references therein)\n(\u2296l p\u2032 ) \u2295l p \u2295l\u22c6 (\u2296\u22c6 k\u2032 ) \u2295\u22c6 k = 0 .\n\n(44)\n\nSince \u2296\u22c6 is the undeformed composition law one has that (\u2296\u22c6 k)\u03bc = \u2212k\u03bc , whereas for the \u2295l composition law the antipode is\nsuch that still (\u2296l p)0 = \u2212p0 but (\u2296l p) j = \u2212p j + lp0 p j (in fact [(\u2296l p) \u2295l p] j = \u2212p j + lp0 p j + p j + l(\u2212p0)p j = 0).\nSo for the process I am considering one has\nl\n\u2212 p\u20321 + lp\u20320 p\u20321 + p1 \u2212 lp\u20320 p1 \u2212 k1\u2032 + k1 + (p0 \u2212 p\u20320 )(k1 \u2212 k1\u2032 ) = 0 .\n2\n\n(45)\n\n\u2212 p\u20320 + p0 \u2212 k0\u2032 + k0 = 0 .\n\n(46)\n\nl\np\u20321 \u2212 p1 \u2243 k1 \u2212 k1\u2032 + (p0 + p\u20320 )(p\u20321 \u2212 p1 ) \u2243 k1 \u2212 k1\u2032 + lp1(p\u20321 \u2212 p1) .\n2\n\n(47)\n\nand\n\nFrom (45) one finds that\n\nwhere on the right-hand side, consistently with the fact that I am working throughout at leading order, I used zero-th order\nproperties in a reexpression of the first-order term.\nThen from (46) one has that\np\u20321 +\n\nk\u2032 2\nk2\nl\nm2\nl\nm2\n\u2212 p21 + M + 1 ,\n\u2212 p\u203212 + M + 1 = p1 +\n\u2032\n2p1 2\n2M\n2p1 2\n2M\n\n(48)\n\n\f15\nwhich gives\np\u20321 \u2212 p1 =\n\n1 2\nm2\nm2\nm2\nl\n1 2\nm2\n\u2212 \u2032 \u2212 (p21 \u2212 p\u203212) \u2243\n\u2212 \u2032 ,\n(k1 \u2212 k1\u2032 2 ) +\n(k1 \u2212 k1\u2032 2 ) +\n2M\n2p1 2p1 2\n2M\n2p1 2p1\n\n(49)\n\nwhere on the right-hand side I used again zero-th order properties in a reexpression of the first-order term.\nCombining (47) and (49) one sees that, at least in the specific context of an elastic collision between a DSR-deformed\nmicro particle and special-relativistic macroscopic body no pathology arises: neither in (47) nor in (49) one finds pathological\ncorrection terms of the type lk or lM.\nIf it turned out to be possible to extend this observation to a wider class of phenomena we might also have an exciting\nopportunity for the description of \"observers\" in DSR-relativistic theories of this sort. In any relativistic theory an observer\nis to be identified with a macroscopic device (or, idealizing, a network of such devices), and so far studies of this type of\non-shell-relation-centered DSR scenarios have kept such observers in a sort of \"limbo\", protected artificially (by hand) from\nthe implications of the deformation of relativistic symmetries. If it turned out to be possible to generalize the observation\nI reported in this section those artificial abstractions could be eliminated in favor of a more satisfactory picture of DSR\nobservers.\n\nVII.\n\nPOTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR OPERA-ANOMALY-TYPE PHENOMENOLOGY\n\nHaving discussed a possible implication of the results I reported in Secs. IV and V for the inclusion of special-relativistic\nmacroscopic bodies in an otherwise DSR-relativistic framework, in this section I go to the opposite extreme of the range\nof possible applications of the results I reported in Secs. IV and V, by considering the possibility that different microscopic\n(possibly \"fundamental\") particles be governed by different DSR-relativistic properties.\nAs I already stressed above (this was characterized as case (i) in the previous section) this possible application is clearly\nviable if one assumes indeed that |l|\u22121 is of the order of the Planck scale (or some other ultralarge momentum scale), since\nfor microscopic particles (even for atoms) the Planck scale is gigantic and all effects of DSR deformation amount to small\ncorrections.\nWhile this is evident, it is nonetheless valuable for me to stress that, in spite of the apparently \"invasive\" prescription of\ndifferent DSR-relativistic properties for different types of particles, the deformation is still a very smooth deformation of\nspecial-relativistic symmetries. I shall do this by showing that some pathologies that are expected in cases where different\nparticles have different relativistic properties (if this is the result of a full breakdown of relativistic symmetries, with emergence\nof a preferred frame), are not present when this feature is introduced in the DSR-compatible manner I proposed in this\nmanuscript.\nIn order to give some tangibility to my discussion (well, some tentative tangibility) I shall take as illustrative example\nthe type of phenomenology of departures from Lorentz symmetry that was recently motivated by the fact that the OPERA\ncollaboration reported [10] tentative evidence of superluminality for neutrinos.\nThe possibility that superluminal particles might well be describable in DSR-compatible fashion (without the introduction\nof a preferred frame) has already been raised in a few OPERA-motivated papers (see, e.g., Refs. [18\u201323]).\nThe fact that particles with the DSR-relativistic properties here described in Sec. III (and IV and V) are \"superluminal\" for\nnegative l (i.e. l/|l| = \u22121) has been established in several previous studies [13, 24\u201327]: when these particles have spatial\nmomentum p such that lp > m2 /p2 their speed is higher than the speed of low-energy photons, and in that sense they indeed\nare \"superluminal\".\nBut, while previous quantum-gravity-inspired studies of DSR-relativistic theories usually assumed \"universality\", it appears\nthat any attempt to do OPERA-inspired phenomenology should require a non-universal picture: for photons of, say, about\n20GeV the agreement of the speed law with the special-relativistic prescription is confirmed at the level of 1 part in 1018 (see,\ne.g., Refs. [28\u201330]), whereas taking the OPERA result at face value one should assume that \u223c 20-GeV neutrinos experience\ndepartures from the special-relativistic speed law at the level of a few parts in 105 .\n\n\f16\nRef. [19] observed that one might well have a universal DSR deformation and yet have \"effectively particle-dependent\neffects\": the illustrative example adopted in Ref. [19] is centered on an on-shell relation of the type\np20 = p2 + m2 + 2l\n\np20 p2\n,\nm\n\n(50)\n\nuniversally for all particles4 , but yet effectively attributing stronger departures from special relativity to lighter particles,\nbecause of the explicit dependence on the mass (a relativistic invariant) in the correction term.\nThis idea of a universal DSR deformation with \"effectively particle-dependent effects\" may well be valuable in OPERAinspired phenomenology. However, from this perspective, I have provided in this manuscript an interesting alternative by\nshowing that it is possible to have a consistent DSR-relativistic framework even endowing different types of particles with\ngenuinely different DSR-relativistic properties. It is now possible to contemplate genuinely \"non-universal\" DSR-relativistic\npictures.\nIn light of this it is an amusing exercise, to which I devote the remainder of this section, to take indeed negative l and\nassume for the purposes of the exercise that |l|\u22121 might be much smaller than the Planck scale, but still much higher than 20\nGeV. This will allow me to contemplate some of the issues that have taken center stage in the OPERA-related literature, as\npossible pathologies of superluminal neutrinos, and show that because of the smoothness of the DSR deformations (even the\nones I here introduced, with a dependence on the type of particle) these concerns do not apply to the DSR formulation I here\nintroduced as first illustrative example of \"non-universal\" DSR-relativistic framework.\nMy OPERA-inspired exercise will be conducted (for the sake of the argument) assuming that only neutrinos are governed\nby the DSR picture of Sec. III, with\np0 = p +\n\nm2\u03bd l 2\n\u2212 p ,\n2p 2\n\n(51)\n\nwhile all other microscopic particles are also governed by the DSR picture of Sec. III but with a weaker deformation\nk0 = k +\n\nm2x \u03bb 2\n\u2212 k\n2k 2\n\n(52)\n\nwith \u03bb also negative and 0 \u2264 |\u03bb| \u2264 |l| (importantly including the case \u03bb = 0, l 6= 0 and the case \u03bb = l as limiting cases).\nA. Absence of Cherenkov-like \u03bd \u2192 \u03bd + X processes\n\nAmong the possible \"pathologies\" for superluminal neutrinos which have been of interest in OPERA-inspired phenomenology much attention has been devoted [31] (also see, e.g., Refs. [32, 33]) to in-vacuo Cherenkov-like processes \u03bd \u2192 \u03bd + X\n(where X may also be, e.g. an electron-positron pair). In-vacuo Cherenkov-like processes are forbidden in special relativity, but in theories with superluminal neutrinos, if they violate/break relativistic invariance (with associated emergence of a\npreferred \"ether\" frame), they can be allowed if the energy of the incoming neutrino is above a certain threshold value.\nRef. [19] (on the basis of results already discussed, for other purposes, in Refs. [34, 35]) already observed that in standard\n\"universal\" DSR-relativistic descriptions of neutrino superluminality, which are fully relativistic and do not have a preferred\nframe, such in-vacuo Cherenkov-like processes remain forbidden, in spite of the superluminality of the neutrinos.\n\n4\n\nMassless particles should anyway be excluded in Eq. (50). A more sophisticated way to achieve similar goals would be to adopt a dispersion relation of\nthe type\np6\np20 = p2 + m2 + l2 2\np0 \u2212 p2\n\n\f17\nThe notion of \"non-universal\" DSR-relativistic framework, which I here introduced, also fully preserves the relativity of\ninertial frames, so in-vacuo Cherenkov-like processes must also be forbidden [11, 34] in this new class of relativistic theories.\nBut it is still valuable to see this in an explicit calculation. So let me analyze the relativistic kinematics of\n\u03bd \u2192 \u03bd+X\nin the novel setup of Sec. V, assuming indeed, as I announced for this section, that neutrinos are affected by deformation with\nparameter l while all other particles are affected by deformation with parameter \u03bb, with 0 \u2264 |\u03bb| \u2264 |l|.\nWithin the framework here introduced in Sec. V such a process should be described in terms of the \"mixing conservation\nlaw\"\n(\u2296l p\u2032 ) \u2295l p \u2295l\u03bb k = 0 .\n\n(53)\n\nwhere p is the (four-)momentum of the outgoing neutrino, k is the momentum of the outgoing X, and \u2296l p\u2032 is the \u2295l -antipode\nof the momentum of the incoming neutrino.\nIn light of the properties specified for \u2295l in Secs. III, IV, V, one finds that the 0-component of this conservation law is\n0 = \u2212p\u20320 + p0 + k0 = \u2212p\u20321 \u2212\n\nm2\nl\nm2 + p2T l 2\nm2 + p2T l 2\n\u2212 p L + kL + x\n\u2212 kL .\n+ p\u203212 + pL +\n\u2032\n2p1 2\n2pL\n2\n2kL\n2\n\n(54)\n\nwhere I also used (51) and (52) with m the mass of the incoming and outgoing neutrino, and mx the rest energy of X. Also\nnotice that I am assuming that the incoming neutrino is ultrarelativistic (in particular p \u226b mx ) and the momenta transverse to\nthe direction of the incoming neutrino are small: along that transverse direction both the outgoing neutrino and the outgoing X\nhave transverse momenta of roughly the same magnitude, here denoted with pT , which is very small compared to the momenta\nthese outgoing particles have along the direction of the incoming neutrino.\nFor the momenta (with index L ) along that direction of the incoming neutrino one obtains from (53)\n\u2212 p\u2032 + lp\u20320 p\u2032 + pL \u2212 lp\u20320 pL + kL +\n\nl+\u03bb\n(p0 \u2212 p\u20320 )kL = 0 .\n2\n\n(55)\n\ni.e.\np\u2032 = pL + kL + lp\u20320kL \u2212\n\nl+\u03bb\nk0 kL\n2\n\n(56)\n\nwhere I used again in the leading-order correction properties established at 0-th order.\nCombining (54) with (56) one obtains\np2T\np2\nm2\nm2\nm2x\nl+\u03bb\nm2\nm2x\nl \u20322 l 2 l 2\nm2\n\u2032\n+ T =\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\nlp\nk\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n,\nk\nk\n\u2212\np\n+\np\n+\nk\n\u2243\nL\n0\nL\n0\n1\nL\nL\n2pL 2kL\n2p\u20321 2pL 2kL\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2p\u20321 2pL 2kL\n\n(57)\n\nwhere on the right-hand side I observed that\nlp\u20320 kL \u2212\n\nl+\u03bb\nl\nl\nl\nk0 kL \u2212 p\u203212 + p2L + kL2 \u2243 0\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\nusing properties valid at 0-th order in rearranging this leading-order correction.\nEq. (57) is the main result of this subsection. For scenarios with neutrino superluminality and breakdown of Lorentz\nsymmetry, with emergence of a preferred frame, the key observation concerning in-vacuo Cherenkov-like processes is that the\nanalog of Eq. (57) contains strong corrections [31] from Lorentz-symmetry-breaking terms such that then real values of pT are\nallowed. One way to see that in-vacuo Cherenkov-like processes are forbidden in special relativity is through the fact that it\nwould require imaginary values of pT . And in my DSR-relativistic analysis I found, as codified in Eq. (57), that independently\nof the value of the momentum of the incoming neutrino the pT is necessarily imaginary; in-vacuo Cherenkov-like processes\nare indeed still forbidden in my DSR-relativistic framework.\n\n\f18\nB.\n\nAbsence of anomalies for \u03c0 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bd\n\nAnother \"pathology\" for superluminal neutrinos which has been of interest in OPERA-inspired phenomenology concerns the pion-decay channel \u03c0 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bd, for which, in theories with superluminal neutrinos,\nif they violate/break relativistic invariance (with associated emergence of a preferred \"ether\" frame), one finds that for\nhigh-energy pions the muon/muon-neutrino phase space available for the decay is severely reduced [36\u201338].\nAlso with respect to this other concern for OPERA-inspired phenomenology the notion of \"non-universal\" DSR-relativistic\nframework, which I here introduced, turns out to be immune, mainly as a result of the fact that it fully preserves the relativity\nof inertial frames. To see this I shall analyze the relativistic kinematics of the process\n\u03c0 \u2192 \u03bc+\u03bd\nin the novel setup of Sec. V, assuming indeed, as I announced for this section, that neutrinos are affected by deformation with\nparameter l while all other particles are affected by deformation with parameter \u03bb, with 0 \u2264 |\u03bb| \u2264 |l|, so that in particular\np\u03bd0 = p\u03bdL +\n\nm2\u03bd + p2T l 2\n\u2212 p\u03bdL\n2p\u03bdL\n2\nm2\u03c0 \u03bb 2\n\u2212 k\n2k\u03c0 2 \u03c0\n\n(59)\n\nm2\u03bc + p2T \u03bb 2\n\u2212 k\u03bcL\n2k\u03bcL\n2\n\n(60)\n\nk\u03c00 = k\u03c0 +\n\nk\u03bc0 = k\u03bcL +\n\n(58)\n\nI am evidently again focusing on the case that the incoming particle (this time the pion) is ultrarelativistic (p\u03c0 \u226b m\u03c0 ) and the\nmomenta transverse to the direction of the incoming pion are small: along that transverse direction both the outgoing neutrino\nand the outgoing muon have transverse momenta of roughly the same magnitude, here denoted again with pT , which is very\nsmall compared to the momenta these outgoing particles have along the direction of the incoming pion.\nOn the basis of the findings here reported in Sec. V the process \u03c0 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bd should be described in terms of the \"mixing\nconservation law\"\np\u03bd \u2295l\u03bb [k\u03bc \u2295\u03bb (\u2296\u03bb k\u03c0 )] = 0 .\n\n(61)\n\nwhere \u2296\u03bb k\u03c0 is the \u2295\u03bb -antipode of the momentum of the incoming pion.\nFor the 0 component this gives\n0 = \u2212k\u03c0 0 + p\u03bd 0 + k\u03bc 0 = \u2212k\u03c0 \u2212\n\nm2\u03bc + p2T \u03bb 2\nm2\u03c0 \u03bb 2\nm2 + p2T l 2\n+ k\u03c0 + p\u03bdL + \u03bd\n\u2212 p\u03bdL + k\u03bcL +\n\u2212 k\u03bcL .\n2k\u03c0 2\n2p\u03bdL\n2\n2k\u03bcL\n2\n\n(62)\n\nwhere I also used (58), (59) and (60).\nFor the momenta (with index L ) along the direction of the incoming pion one obtains from (61):\np\u03bdL + k\u03bcL \u2212 k\u03c0 + \u03bbk\u03c00k\u03c0 \u2212 \u03bbk\u03bc0 k\u03c0 +\n\nl+\u03bb\np\u03bd0 (k\u03bcL \u2212 k\u03c0 ) = 0 .\n2\n\n(63)\n\ni.e.\nk\u03c0 = p\u03bdL + k\u03bcL + +lp\u03bd0k\u03c0 \u2212\n\nl+\u03bb\np\u03bd0 p\u03bdL\n2\n\n(64)\n\n\f19\nwhere again on the right-hand side I used properties of the 0-th order result in rearranging the leading-order correction.\nCombining (62) with (64) one obtains\nm2\u03bc\nm2\u03bc\np2\nm2\nm2\nl+\u03bb\nm2\nl\n\u03bb 2\n\u03bb\nm2\np2T\n+ T = \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bd \u2212\n+ lp\u03bd0k\u03c0 \u2212\n,\np\u03bd0 p\u03bdL + p2\u03bdL + k\u03bcL\n\u2212 k\u03c02 \u2243 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bd \u2212\n2p\u03bdL 2k\u03bcL\n2k\u03c0 2p\u03bdL 2k\u03bcL\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2k\u03c0 2p\u03bdL 2k\u03bcL\n\n(65)\n\nwhere on the right-hand side I observed that\nlp\u03bd0 k\u03c0 \u2212\n\nl+\u03bb\nl\n\u03bb 2\n\u03bb\np\u03bd0 p\u03bdL + p2\u03bdL + k\u03bcL\n\u2212 k\u03c02 \u2243 0\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\nusing properties valid at 0-th order in rearranging this leading-order correction.\nEq. (65) is the main result of this subsection. For scenarios with neutrino superluminality and breakdown of Lorentz\nsymmetry, with emergence of a preferred frame, the key observation concerning \u03c0 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bd is that the analog of Eq. (65)\ncontains strong corrections [36\u201338] from Lorentz-symmetry-breaking terms, such that the combinations of p\u03bdL and k\u03bcL which\nsatisfy the requirement p2T > 0 only amount to a very small phase space. Instead in my DSR-relativistic analysis I found\nEq. (65), in which all correction terms canceled each other out, so that the phase space available for the decay in the DSR case\nis identical to the phase space available for the decay in the standard special-relativistic case.\nI should stress that this result holds in a leading-order analysis, and it is therefore reliable only for p\u03c0 \u226a |l|\u22121 (which however\nis the case of interest for Refs. [36\u201338]). For p\u03c0 \u223c |l|\u22121 one might have sizeable modifications of the phase space even in a\nDSR case.\nC. Back to quantum gravity and the Planck scale\n\nThe observations reported in the previous two subsections may be used in attempts of interpreting the OPERA anomaly as an\nactual manifestation of physics beyond the reach of special relativity. But chances are the OPERA anomaly will be eventually\nfound to be described by much less exotic physics. One should therefore expect that the most promising applications of\nthe results in the previous two subsections will be in the context where DSR-deformations of Lorentz symmetry were first\nconceived, studies of the quantum-gravity problem, for which such deformations would not be surprising, in the case with\ndeformation scale roughly of the order of the Planck scale.\nThere were some studies (see, e.g., Refs. [39\u201341]) proposing mechanisms by which quantum-gravity/quantum-spacetime\neffects could produce departures from Lorentz symmetry of different magnitude for different particles. The results I reported\nin this manuscript show that such scenarios do not necessarily have to \"break\" Lorentz invariance, producing a preferred\n\"ether\" frame. One could attempt to discuss such scenarios in terms of the particle-type-dependent DSR-deformations of\nLorentz symmetry I here proposed. And then the results reported in the previous two subsections could be valuable assets for\nthe corresponding \"Planck-scale phenomenology\".\nFrom that perspective I should stress that, as the careful reader can easily verify, the point made in Subsec. VII A for\nthe process \u03bd \u2192 \u03bd + X can be generalized to all Cherenkov-like processes A \u2192 A + X. And similarly the point made in\nSubsec. VII B for the process \u03c0 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bd can be generalized to all decay processes A \u2192 B + C.\nVIII. ASIDE ON A \"\u03ba\u03ba-MINKOWSKI SPACETIME\" AND ALGEBRAS WITH \"MIXING CO-PRODUCTS\"\nA.\n\nContemplating algebras with \"mixing co-products\"\n\nI have here introduced a new class of (DSR-)relativistic theories, focusing in this first study on kinematics. I expect that in\norder to achieve a full empowerment of this new class of theories it will be necessary to identify a symmetry-algebra counterpart to the novel type of relativistic kinematics I here proposed. This balance is rather visible in special relativity, whose full\n\n\f20\nunderstanding requires combining the Poincar\u00e9 symmetry algebra and Einstein kinematics.\nAnd this \"balance of powers\" appears to be preserved also in the illustrative example of \"universal\" DSR-relativistic theory\nwhich I here took as starting point, in Sec. III: for the specific example of DSR deformation of relativistic kinematics here\nreviewed in Sec. III one can find numerous points of contact with the structure of the \u03ba-Poincar\u00e9 Hopf algebra [16, 17]. In\nparticular, the most crucial aspect of that construction, the composition law\n(p \u2295l p\u2032 )1 = p1 + p\u20321 + lp0 p\u20321 , (p \u2295l p\u2032 )0 = p0 + p\u20320 ,\n\n(66)\n\ncan be placed in correspondence with the law of \"co-product\" that characterizes the \u03ba-Poincar\u00e9 Hopf algebra in the MajidRuegg basis [16], which in leading order reads\n1\n\u2206(P1 ) \u2243 P1 \u2297 1 + 1 \u2297 P1 + P0 \u2297 P1 , \u2206(P0 ) = P0 \u2297 1 + 1 \u2297 P0 .\n\u03ba\n\n(67)\n\nIn order to establish a similar connection between relativistic kinematics and symmetry algebras for the novel class of\nrelativistic theories I here proposed in Secs. IV and V it would seem necessary to introduce on the algebra side enough\nstructure to accommodate at least 3 laws of coproduct: two different laws of the type (67)\n\u2206l (P1 ) \u2243 P1 \u2297 1 + 1 \u2297 P1 + lP0 \u2297 P1 ,\n\u2206\u03bb (P1 ) \u2243 P1 \u2297 1 + 1 \u2297 P1 + \u03bbP0 \u2297 P1 ,\n\n\u2206l (P0 ) = P0 \u2297 1 + 1 \u2297 P0 ,\n\u2206\u03bb (P0 ) = P0 \u2297 1 + 1 \u2297 P0 ,\n\nand a novel \"mixing coproduct\" of a type illustrated by\n\u2206l \u03bb (P1 ) \u2243 P1 \u2297 1 + 1 \u2297 P1 +\n\nl+\u03bb\nP0 \u2297 P1 , \u2206l \u03bb (P0 ) = P0 \u2297 1 + 1 \u2297 P0 .\n2\n\n(68)\n\nI am not aware of any work on symmetry algebras (some sort of \"\u03ba\u03ba-Poincar\u00e9 algebra\") already providing these structures,\nbut it appears natural to expect that such a construction should be possible.\nB. Toward a \"\u03ba\u03ba-Minkowski spacetime\"\n\nThere is at least one more ingredient that would be desirable, in addition to looking for a \"symmetry-algebra counterpart\", as\nan enrichment of the non-universal DSR deformations I here introduced focusing temporarily on aspects pertaining kinematics\nfrom a momentum space perspective. This other desired ingredient is (one form or another of) a \"spacetime picture\".\nI shall not speculate much about this here. I expect it may require several striking steps of abstraction, which will take time\nto mature. Even for universal DSR deformation we are still in the \"digestion process\" for some of the striking new features\nthat the associate spacetime pictures typically introduce, such as the relativity of spacetime locality [25, 26]. We must expect\nfeatures possibly even more virulent (but again not necessarily in conflict with established experimental facts) to be typical\nfor the novel non-universal DSR deformations I am here introducing.\nHoping to offer a useful contribution to the study of these issues I venture to formulate here only a preliminary speculation.\nThis concerns the fact that for the illustrative example of \"universal\" DSR-relativistic theory which I here took as starting\npoint, in Sec. III, there is an established \"formal link\" to the so-called \"\u03ba-Minkowski spacetime\" (see, e.g.,Refs. [16, 17, 42]),\nin which the same scale \u03ba of (67) appears in a form of spacetime noncommutativity\n1\n[x\u0302 j , t\u02c6] = i x\u0302 j , [x\u0302 j , x\u0302k ] = 0 .\n\u03ba\n\n(69)\n\nThe core feature of this formal link is visible already in how the composition law (6)\n(p \u2295l p\u2032 )1 = p1 + p\u20321 + lp0 p\u20321\n\n(70)\n\n\f21\nemerges in cases where certain ordering prescriptions are applied in analyses of \u03ba-Minkowski noncommutativity, such as in\nj\n\n\u2032 j\n\nlp0 p\u2032 x\u0302 j\nj\n\nj\n\neip j x\u0302 eip0t\u02c6eip j x\u0302 = eip j x\u0302 eie\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nj\n\neip0t\u02c6 \u2243 ei[p j +p j +lp0 p j ]x\u0302 eip0t\u02c6\n\n(71)\n\nwhere I used (69) for l \u2261 1/\u03ba.\nInspired by this observation, one may consider attempting to provide a formal spacetime picture for a non-universal DSRrelativistic scenario of the type in Sec. V by seeking a generalization/deformation of \u03ba-Minkowski spacetime, suitable for\naccommodating the \"mixing composition law\" introduced in Sec.

ASIDE BEYOND LEADING ORDER\n\nI have worked throughout this manuscript at leading order in the deformation scale. As stressed above this is the only\nreasonable choice since in quantum-gravity/Planck-scale phenomenology it would be already very fortunate to ever uncover\nleading-order effects and at least presently going beyond leading order is unjustified. As I stressed already in Refs. [1, 3],\nenforcing some sort of requirement of mathematical consistency beyond leading order is not only inappropriate because of the\nlimitations of the expected experimental sensitivities, but may also be inappropriate in light of the complexity of the quantumgravity problem: even if DSR-deformations of Lorentz symmetry do end up being actually relevant for quantum gravity (and\nof course this is only a remote hypothesis) it may well be the case that only their \"leading-order formulation\" makes sense\nphysically. This is because the availability of a description in terms of DSR deformations essentially still assumes a rather\nstandard picture of spacetime, novel enough to include striking new features such as a relativity of spacetime locality [14, 25,\n26], but still conventional enough to allow a description to a large extent still consistent with the standard role of spacetime in\nphysics. However, the nature of the quantum-gravity problem is such that it would not be surprising if, as the characteristic\nenergy scales get closer to the Planck scale (just as the leading-order analysis starts to be insufficient), at some point there\nwould be the onset of a completely foreign regime of the laws of physics, not even affording us the luxury of the abstraction\nof an (however exotic) spacetime formulation.\nSo I do not view the development of DSR pictures beyond leading order as an important priority. It is nonetheless conceptually intriguing and provides amusing challenges. I shall not dwell much here on this issue, but let me nonetheless at\nleast exhibit, in this section, partial results that provide some encouragement for the idea that such \"all-order particle-typedependent DSR-deformations\" are indeed possible.\nThe first ingredient I introduce for this purpose is an \"all-order generalization\" of the type of particle described in Sec. III.\nThis generalization replaces Eqs. (5) (6), (7), (9) with\ncosh(lm) = cosh(lp0 ) \u2212\n\nl2 \u2212lp0 2\np1\ne\n2\n\n(78)\n\n(p \u2295l p\u2032 )1 = p1 + elp0 p\u20321 , (p \u2295l p\u2032 )0 = p0 + p\u20320 .\n\n[N, p0 ] = p1 , [N, p1 ] =\n\ne2lp0 \u2212 1 l 2\n+ p1 ,\n2l\n2\n\n(79)\n\n(80)\n\nN[p\u2295l p\u2032 ] = N[p] + elp0 N[p\u2032 ]\n\n(81)\n\nThese formulas may be viewed as a kinematical counterpart from some of the structures, including the mentioned co-products,\nof one of the descriptions [16] of the the \u03ba-Poincar\u00e9 Hopf algebra.\nIn this section I refer to particles governed by Eqs. (78) (79), (80), (81) as \"p-particles\" and denote their momenta consistently with p (or p\u2032 or p\u2032\u2032 ...).\nIt is easy to see that Eqs. (78) (79), (80), (81) ensure relativistic consistency for the description of such particles. In\nparticular,\n[N, cosh(lp0 ) \u2212\n\nl2 \u2212lp0 2\np1 ] = 0\ne\n2\n\n(82)\n\nand interactions among \"p-particles\", with conservation law p \u2295l p\u2032 \u2295l p\u2032\u2032 = 0, evidently admit consistent relativistic description, as shown by the following two equations:\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n[N[p] + elp0 N[p\u2032 ] + el(p0+p0 ) N[p\u2032\u2032 ] , p0 + p\u20320 + p\u2032\u20320 ] = p1 + elp0 p\u20321 + el(p0+p0 ) p\u2032\u20321 = (p \u2295l p\u2032 \u2295l p\u2032\u2032 )1 = 0\n\n(83)\n\n\f23\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n[N[p] + elp0 N[p\u2032 ] + el(p0+p0 ) N[p\u2032\u2032 ] , p1 + elp0 p\u20321 + el(p0+p0 ) p\u2032\u20321 ] =\n!\n\u0012 2lp\n\u0013\n2lp\u20320 \u2212 1\ne 0 \u22121 l 2\nl \u20322\n\u2032\n2lp0 e\n=\n+ p1 + e\n+ p1 + e2l(p0+p0 )\n2l\n2\n2l\n2\n\u2032\n\n!\n\u2032\u2032\ne2lp0 \u2212 1 l \u2032\u2032 2\n+ p1 +\n2l\n2\n\n\u2032\n\n+lelp0 p1 p\u20321 + lel(p0+p0 ) p1 p\u2032\u20321 + lel(2p0+p0 ) p\u20321 p\u2032\u20321 =\n!\n\u00112\n2l(p0 +p\u20320 +p\u2032\u20320 )\ne\n\u2032\n\u2212\n1\nl\u0010\np1 + elp0 p\u20321 + el(p0+p0 ) p\u2032\u20321 +\n=0\n=\n2\n2l\n\n(84)\n\nwhere for both these results I of course enforced on the right-hand side the conservation law p \u2295l p\u2032 \u2295l p\u2032\u2032 = 0 itself.\nNote that from (83) and (84) it also follows that, for the conservation law p \u2295l p\u2032 = 0, one has\n[N[p] + elp0 N[p\u2032 ] , p0 + p\u20320 ] = 0\nand\n[N[p] + elp0 N[p\u2032 ] , p1 + elp0 p\u20321 ] = 0\nSo I have a fully consistent (and consistent to all orders in l) DSR-relativistic description of p-particles, propagating (with\np \u2295l p\u2032 = 0 conservation) and interacting among themselves (with p \u2295l p\u2032 \u2295l p\u2032\u2032 = 0 conservation).\nMy next task is to introduce a second type of particles, with different DSR-relativistic properties. For these \"k-particles\"\n(whose momenta I shall consistently denote with k or k\u2032 ...) I take the following on-shell relation\ncosh(l\u03bc) = cosh(lk0 ) \u2212\n\nl2 2\nk\n2 1\n\n(85)\n\nand boost such that\n[N[k] , k0 ] = k1 , [N[k] , k1 ] =\n\nsinh(lk0 )\n,\nl\n\n(86)\n\nwhich indeed is compatible with the on-shell relation\n[N[k] , cosh(lk0 ) \u2212\n\nl2 2\nk ]=0.\n2 1\n\n(87)\n\nNotice that I am now considering a case where also the DSR-deformation of the second type of particle is characterized by\nthe same deformation scale l, but the form of the laws of transformation that apply to the two types of particles are very\nsignificantly different.\nFor this section of \"aside beyond leading order\" I do not go as far as introducing a proper composition law for k-particles\nand/or a proper \"p-particle/k-particle mixing composition law\" to be used as general rules applicable to all sorts of processes.\nI will instead directly show that some acceptable conservation laws, relevant for certain specific processes, do admit a fully\nrelativistic description.\nAnd I will not elaborate on the ways to construct such conservation laws, but the careful reader will notice that their structure\ncan be seen as inspired by either one of two ways of characterizing equivalently the covariance of my choice of conservation\nlaw for \"k-particle propagation processes\", which is the undeformed one:\nk0 + k0\u2032 = 0 , k1 + k1\u2032 = 0 .\n\n(88)\n\nThis evidently is compatible with a correspondingly undeformed law of \"composition of boosts\" N[k] :\n[N[k] + N[k\u2032 ] , k0 + k0\u2032 ] = k1 + k1\u2032 = 0 , [N[k] + N[k\u2032 ] , k1 + k1\u2032 ] =\n\nsinh(lk0 ) sinh(lk0\u2032 )\n+\n=0,\nl\nl\n\n(89)\n\n\f24\nwhere I of course also used the conservation law k0 + k0\u2032 = 0, k1 + k1\u2032 = 0 itself.\nThe anticipated interesting alternative way to characterize this conservation law for \"k-particle propagation processes\" is\ncentered on noticing that (88) can be rewritten equivalently as\n\u2032\n\nk0 + k0\u2032 = 0 , e\u2212lk0 /2 k1 + elk0 /2 k1\u2032 = 0 ,\n\n(90)\n\nwhose compatibility with the N[k] boost could be described as follows\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n[e\u2212lk0 /2 N[k] + elk0/2 N[k\u2032 ] , k0 + k0\u2032 ] = e\u2212lk0 /2 k1 + elk0/2 k1\u2032 = 0 ,\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n[e\u2212lk0 /2 N[k] + elk0/2 N[k\u2032 ] , e\u2212lk0 /2 k1 + elk0 /2 k1\u2032 ] = e\u2212lk0 /2\n\nsinh(lk0 )\n+e\nl\n\n(91)\n\u2032\nlk0 /2 sinh(lk0 )\n\nl\n\n=0.\n\n(92)\n\nI do not provide any other conservation law for processes involving exclusively k-particles (as such I provide a picture for\nk-particles that do not self-interact). But I do provide \"mixing conservation laws\", for processes involving both k-particles and\np-particles, with structure which may be viewed as inspired either by the form of (88),(89) or by the form of (90),(91),(92).\nThe first such \"mixing composition law\" which I exhibit is for simple \"oscillation processes\"\nk0 + p0 = 0 , k1 + elk0 /2 p1 = 0\nand is compatible with the following law of \"mixing of boosts\"\nN[k] + elk0 /2 N[p]\nThis is easily verified from the following two observations:\n[N[k] + elk0/2 N[p] , k0 + p0 ] = k1 + elk0/2 p1 = 0\nand\n[N[k] + elk0 /2 N[p] , k1 + elk0 /2 p1 ] =\n\u0013\n\u0012 2lp\n0 \u22121\nl 2\nsinh(lk0 )\nlk0 e\n+e\n+ p1 +\n=\nl\n2l\n2\nl lk0 /2\n+ e\nk1 p 1 =\n2\n\u0011 \u0012 elk0 +2lp0 \u2212 e\u2212lk0 \u0013\n\u0010\nl\n=0\n= elk0 /2 p1 k1 + elk0 /2 p1 +\n2\n2l\nA first example of consistently relativistic conservation law for interactions among k-particles and p-particles is the following:\nk0 + p0 + p\u20320 = 0 , k1 + elk0 /2 p1 + elk0 /2 elp0 p\u20321 = 0 ,\nwhich is for one k-particle interacting with two p-particles and is compatible with the following law of \"kpp mixing of boosts\"\nN[k] + elk0 /2 N[p] + elk0 /2 elp0 N[p\u2032 ] .\nThis is easily verified as follows:\n[N[k] + elk0 /2 N[p] + elk0/2 elp0 N[p\u2032 ] , k0 + p0 + p\u20320 ] = k1 + elk0/2 p1 + elk0 /2 elp0 p\u20321 = 0\n\n\f25\n[N[k] + elk0 /2 N[p] + elk0/2 elp0 N[p\u2032 ] , k1 + elk0 /2 p1 + elk0/2 elp0 p\u20321 ] =\n!\n\u0012 2lp\n\u0013\n2lp\u20320\n0 \u22121\n\u2212 1 l \u20322\nl 2\nsinh(lk0 )\nlk0 e\nlk0 2lp0 e\n+e\n+ p1 + e e\n+ p1 +\n=\nl\n2l\n2\n2l\n2\nl\nl\n+ elk0 /2 k1 p1 + elk0 /2 elp0 k1 p\u20321 + lelk0 elp0 p1 p\u20321 =\n2\n2\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011\nl \u0010 lk0 /2\n=\ne\np1 + elk0 /2 elp0 p\u20321 k1 + elk0 /2 p1 + elk0 /2 elp0 p\u20321 +\n2\n\n\u2032\n\nelk0 +2lp0 +2lp0 \u2212 e\u2212lk0\n2l\n\n!\n\n=0\n\nFinally I also exhibit a consistently relativistic conservation law for interactions involving two k-particles and one p-particle:\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nk0 + p0 + p\u20320 = 0 , e\u2212lk0 e\u2212lk0 /2 k1 + e\u2212lk0 /2 k1 + p1 = 0\nwhich is compatible with the following law of \"kkp mixing of boosts\"\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\ne\u2212lk0 e\u2212lk0 /2 N[k] + e\u2212lk0/2 N[k\u2032 ] + N[p]\nas one can again easily verify:\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n[e\u2212lk0 e\u2212lk0 /2 N[k] + e\u2212lk0/2 N[k\u2032 ] + N[p] , k0 + k0\u2032 + p0] = e\u2212lk0 e\u2212lk0 /2 k1 + e\u2212lk0/2 k1 + p1 = 0\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n[e\u2212lk0 e\u2212lk0 /2 N[k] + e\u2212lk0 /2 N[k\u2032 ] + N[p] , e\u2212lk0 e\u2212lk0 /2 k1 + e\u2212lk0 /2 k1 + p1] =\n\u0013\n\u0012 2lp\n\u2032\n\u2032\nsinh(lk0 )\nl\n\u2032 sinh(lk0 )\n\u2032\nl\n\u2032\n\u2032\ne 0 \u22121 l 2\n= e\u22122lk0 e\u2212lk0\n+ e\u2212lk0\n+\n+ p1 \u2212 e\u22122lk0 e\u2212lk0 k12 \u2212 e\u2212lk0 k1\u2032 2 \u2212 le\u22123lk0/2 e\u2212lk0 k1 k1\u2032 =\nl\nl\n2l\n2\n2\n2\n!\n\u2032\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011\ne2lk0 +2lp0 \u2212 e\u22122lk0\nl\u0010\n\u2212lk0\u2032 \u2212lk0 /2\n\u2212lk0\u2032 /2 \u2032\n\u2212lk0\u2032 \u2212lk0 /2\n\u2212lk0\u2032 /2 \u2032\np1 \u2212 e\n=0\ne\nk1 \u2212 e\nk1 p 1 + e\ne\nk1 + e\nk1 +\n=\n2\n2l\nX. CLOSING REMARKS\n\nThe fact, here established, that there are consistent scenarios of \"non-universal\" deformation of Lorentz symmetry, with\nparticle-type-dependent deformations of relativistic kinematics, can be used to address some long-standing issues in DSR\nresearch, mentioned in Sec. I, and can also be the starting point for several further developments and further generalizations.\nSome of these future studies could be directed toward the understanding of the associated relativity of spacetime locality. It\nis established that already for some \"universal\" DSR-deformation schemes spacetime locality becomes relative [25\u201327]. The\ncase of \"non-universal\" DSR-deformation here introduced should have subtle implications also for the characterization of the\nrelativity of spacetime locality.\nAnd it is established that for some schemes of \"universal\" DSR deformation it is possible to provide a formulation within the\n\"relative-locality framework\" [14, 15], centered on the geometry of momentum space. It would therefore be interesting to\nattempt to generalize the relative-locality-framework formulation also to the case of the \"non-universal\" DSR deformations\nhere introduced, but this raises some intriguing questions: could then one describe the different types of particles on the same\ngeometry of momentum space? or should one rather seek a formulation based on different momentum-space geometries for\ndifferent particles? and in that case which sort of geometric requirement could codify the feature here formulated in terms of\na \"mixing composition law\"?\nOne more intriguing question I want to mention here concerns the types of different relativistic properties which can be\nfound to be compatible. In the construction of the cases I here analyzed as illustrative examples a consistent particle-dependent\n\n\f26\n(\"non-universal\") DSR deformation was achieved also exploiting in part the fact that I confined myself to considering only\nrather mild differences of relativistic properties: I managed to \"mix\" particles governed by quantitatively very different deformations of relativistic kinematics, but all members of a class of related such deformations. Having established that this can\nbe done consistently, one may now ask whether it is possible to \"mix\" in a single consistent relativistic framework particles\nwith more profoundly different relativistic properties. Ideally one would like to establish some sort of theorem characterizing\nthe types of different relativistic properties which can be made compatible in the sense I here introduced. Such a theorem\nappears to be extremely challenging, but even gaining some expertise on the basis of a few \"trial-and-error exercises\" might\nbe valuable.\n\n\f27\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n[26]\n[27]\n[28]\n[29]\n[30]\n[31]\n[32]\n[33]\n[34]\n[35]\n[36]\n[37]\n[38]\n[39]\n[40]\n[41]\n[42]\n\nG.
