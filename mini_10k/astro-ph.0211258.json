Astrophysical determinations of the abundances\nof D, 4 He and 7 Li agree with those found in homogeneous BBN calculations, for a suitable\nrange of the baryon-to-photon ratio \u03b7 [15, 16]. The decay products of massive unstable\nparticles such as gravitinos would have produced electromagnetic and/or hadronic showers\nin the early Universe, which could have either destroyed or created these nuclei, perturbing\nthis concordance. Maintaining the concordance provides important upper limits on the\nabundances of such massive unstable particles. The power of this argument has recently\nbeen increased by observations of the power spectrum of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) [17]. These now provide an independent determination of \u03b7 that is in\nrather good agreement with the value suggested by BBN calculations [18]-[22], reducing one\nof the principal uncertainties in the previous BBN limits on massive unstable particles.\nThis development has triggered us to re-evaluate these BBN constraints. We do so via a\nnew calculation of the network of nuclear reactions induced by electromagnetic showers that\ncreate and destroy the light elements deuterium (D), 3 He, 4 He, 6 Li and 7 Li. We perform a\ncoupled-channel analysis of the light-element abundances, which enables us to analyze the\npossible existence of isolated 'islands' of parameter space that are not minor perturbations\nof standard homogeneous BBN calculations. In carrying out this program, we also take the\nopportunity to improve previous theoretical treatments of some reactions in essential ways.\nWe also derive analytic approximations to our results, which serve as a check of the numerics,\nand offer additional insight into the essential physics.\nConsiderations of the D abundance alone would have led to the apparent existence of\nfinely-tuned 'tails' of parameter space that extend the region allowed by standard BBN\ncalculations to rather larger abundances of unstable relic particles. In the past, these 'tails'\nwere argued to be excluded on the basis of the combined D + 3 He abundance. It is now\nwidely considered that the complicated chemical and stellar history of 3 He renders such\nan argument unsafe [23]. However, we show here that these tails are excluded robustly\nby the astrophysical abundance of 4 He, and also conflict with the measured 6 Li abundance.\nThese other abundances also exclude a disconnected 'channel' of parameter space that would\nhave been allowed by the D abundance alone. Overall, the most stringent upper limit on\n2\nthe possible abundance of an unstable massive relic particle X with lifetime \u03c4X >\n\u223c 10 s is\nprovided by the 6 Li abundance. For \u03c4X = 108 s, we find\nMX\n\nn0X\n< 5.0\u00d710\u221212 GeV,\nn0\u03b3\n\n(1)\n\nwith the upper limit from the 4 He abundance being about two orders of magnitude less\nstringent.\nAs an illustrative application of this new analysis, we reconsider the allowed abundance\nof unstable gravitinos G\u0303 with masses up to about 10 TeV, which are expected to have\n2\nlifetimes >\n\u223c 10 s. Using standard calculations of thermal gravitino production in the early\n1\n\n\fUniverse [24] - [32] , [8], the constraint (1) suggests a stringent upper limit on the reheating\ntemperature TR of the Universe following inflation:\n6\nTR <\n\u223c 10 GeV for MG\u0303 \u223c 100 GeV.\n\n(2)\n\nSuch a stringent upper limit can be problematic for standard inflationary models [33], some\nof which predict higher TR \u223c 1012 GeV. A low reheating temperature might also be problematic for some models of baryogenesis in which thermal production of baryon-number-violating\nparticles is necessary, though not for others. The simplest leptogenesis scenarios [34] require\nthe production of a right-handed neutrino state whose decays violate lepton number. However, even scenarios which require the thermal production of right-handed neutrinos can in\nfact accommodate very low reheat temperatures [35, 36], and non-thermal production of\nparticles with masses less than the inflaton mass is possible for very low reheating temperatures [37]. Leptogenesis scenarios [38] of this type as well as those involving preheating [39]\nhave been proposed 1 .\n4\nReheat temperatures higher than (2) would be allowed if \u03c4G\u0303 <\n\u223c 10 s, as might occur\nif MG\u0303 >\n\u223c 3 TeV and/or the gravitino has many available decay modes. Alternatively, one\nmay consider the possibility of a very light gravitino that would be stable or metastable.\nHowever, in this case the upper limit (1) would apply to the next-to-lightest supersymmetric\nparticle (NLSP). In conventional MSSM scenarios with a very light gravitino, this might be\nthe lightest neutralino \u03c7. However, the relic \u03c7 abundance may also be calculated, and is\nlikely to conflict with the upper limit (1).\nThis brief discussion serves to emphasize the importance of evaluating the cosmological\nupper limit on the possible primordial abundance of unstable relic particles, to which the\nbulk of this paper is devoted. In Section 2, we discuss the most relevant photodissociation\nand photoproduction processes and describe their implementation in a code to calculate the\nnetwork of reactions creating and destroying light elements in the early Universe. A brief\ndiscussion of the observational constraints used is in Section 3. Analytical and numerical\nresults for light-element abundances are presented in Section 4. Our main constraints on\nunstable particles are described in Section 5, where we compare and combine the upper\nlimits obtained by considering different light nuclei. Finally, in Section 6 we discuss in more\ndetail the implications of our results for cosmological gravitinos. Section 7 contains some\ncomments on particles with longer (and shorter) lifetimes. In Appendix A, we compile and\ndiscuss the cross sections used in this analysis.\n\n2\n\nPhoton Injection and Abundance Evolution\n\nAs an example of the constraints imposed on the abundance of a heavy metastable particle\nby observations of light elements, we consider the radiative decay of a massive particle (such\n4\nas a gravitino) with lifetime >\n\u223c 10 s. The energetic decay photon initiates an electromagnetic\nshower, which in turn initiates a network of nuclear interactions. The decays of some unstable\nheavy particles also initiate hadronic showers, which would provide an additional set of\n1\n\nWe also recall that Affleck-Dine [40] leptogenesis [36, 41] can be accomplished at low TR .\n\n2\n\n\f2\nconstraints. These are typically important for shorter lifetimes, \u03c4 <\n\u223c 10 s. However, we\nrestrict our attention in this paper to the network of reactions induced by electromagnetic\nshowers, and comment on very short (and very long) lifetimes in Section 7.\n\n2.1\n\nThe Initial Degraded Photon Spectrum\n\n4\n2\nAt the epoch of interest to us here, \u03c4X >\n\u223c 10 sec, the massive gravitino is very nonrelativistic, and can be treated as if at rest with respect to the background. We assume\nthat a gravitino of mass MX decays into a photon (\u03b3) and a neutralino (\u03c7), each with their\nrespective energies,\n\nE\u03b3 =\n\nMX2 \u2212 m2\u03c7\nM 2 + m2\u03c7\nand E\u03c7 = X\n.\n2MX\n2MX\n\n(3)\n\nIn the limit MX \u226b m\u03c7 , the energies become almost equal: E\u03b3 \u223c E\u03c7 \u223c 21 MX .\nThe primary photon with injection energy E0 interacts with the background plasma and\ncreates an electromagnetic cascade. The most rapid interactions in this cascade are pair\nproduction \u03b3\u03b3bg \u2192 e+ e\u2212 off of background photons, and inverse compton scattering. These\nprocesses rapidly redistribute the injected energy, and the nonthermal photon spectrum\nrapidly reaches a quasi-static equilibrium as discussed in [7, 9, 10]. The \"zeroth generation\"\nquasi-equilibrium photon energy spectrum is\np\u03b3 (E\u03b3 ) =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\n\u0011\nEX 1.5\n\u0010 E\u03b3 \u00112.0\nK0 EEX\u03b3\n\nK0\n0\n\n\u0010\n\nif E\u03b3 < EX\nfor EX < E\u03b3 < EC\notherwise\n\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the normalization constant K0 is determined by demanding that the total energy be\n2\nequal to the injected energy: K0 = E0 /[EX\n(2 + ln (EC /EX ))]. This spectrum is the same as\nthat used by Protheroe, Stanev, & Berezinksy [10] and Jedamzik [12], and also agrees with\nthe result of a detailed numerical integration of the full Bolzmann equation by Kawasaki and\nMoroi [9] 3 . It is a broken power law with a transition at E\u03b3 = EX and a high-energy cutoff at\nE\u03b3 = EC . We adopt the same energy limits as Kawasaki and Moroi, namely EX = m2e /80T\nand EC = m2e /22T . Physically, these scales arise due to the competition between photon\ndegradation rates. The scales rise as the temperature drops, in which case there exist more\nhigh-energy photons to break up nuclei.\nThe zeroth-generation nonthermal photons then suffer additional interactions of Compton\nscattering, ordinary pair production off of nuclei, and \u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3 scattering. These slower processes further degrade the photon specturm. The evolution of the resulting \"first-generation\"\nphotons is governed by\nnX\ndN\u03b3\np\u03b3 (E\u03b3 ) \u2212 N\u03b3 (E\u03b3 )\u0393\u03b3 (E\u03b3 ),\n(E\u03b3 ) =\ndt\n\u03c4X\n\n(5)\n\n2\n\nFor definiteness, we will refer to the decaying particle as a gravitino, though our analysis is general and\npertains to any massive particle with electromagnetic decays in the lifetime range considered.\n3\nThe spectrum stated in [9] includes further photon degradation, which has been factored out to determine\nour spectrum.\n\n3\n\n\fwhere nX = n0X (1 + z)3 exp (\u2212t/\u03c4X ) and \u03c4X are the decaying particle number density at\nredshift z and mean lifetime, respectively. Also, N\u03b3 is the photon energy spectrum, which is\nsimply the product of the density of states D\u03b3 and the occupation number fraction f\u03b3 . Integrating N\u03b3 over all energies yields the number density ninj\n\u03b3 of the injected photons. Further,\n\u0393\u03b3 is the rate at which the photons are further degraded through further interactions with\nthe background plasma. The key difference between p\u03b3 and N\u03b3 is that the rates degrading\nphotons directly after injection are much faster than the rates that further degrade photon\nenergy determining N\u03b3 . We note that the effects due to the expansion of the universe on\nthe photon spectrum are negligible because, during this epoch, electromagnetic interactions\nare much faster than the expansion rate.\nThe dominant photon degradation rates are those for double photon scattering, Compton\nscattering and pair production off nuclei. Because their high rates are fast compared to\nthe cosmic expansion, the photon distribution reaches quasi-static equilibrium (QSE). This\ndistribution is given by setting (5) equal to zero, yielding\nN\u03b3QSE (E\u03b3 ) =\n\nnX p\u03b3 (E\u03b3 )\n.\n\u0393\u03b3 (E\u03b3 )\u03c4X\n\n(6)\n\nThis QSE solution is the same as that derived in [9], where it is called f\u03b3 (\u01eb\u03b3 ). The photon\nspectrum p\u03b3 can be determined easily from this equation, knowing that double-photon scattering dominates the high-energy region, whereas Compton scattering and pair production\noff nuclei dominate at lower energies. We recall that the redshift dependence of this QSE\nsolution lies entirely in nX , p\u03b3 , and \u0393\u03b3 .\n\n2.2\n\nPhoto-Destruction and -Production of Nuclei\n\nThe equations governing the production and destruction of nuclei are very similar to those\nfor photons, being given by\ndNA\n(EA ) = JA (EA ) \u2212 NA (EA )\u0393A (EA ),\ndt\n\n(7)\n\nwhere JA and \u0393A are the source and sink rates of primary species A. The derivative, d/dt\ntakes into account the redshifting of energies and the dilution of particles due to the expansion\nof the universe. The source terms for the primary species are due to the photodissociation\nof background particles, and are defined by:\nJA (EA ) =\n\nX\n\nnT\n\nT\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nh\n\n\u221e\n\ni\n\ndE\u03b3 N\u03b3QSE (E\u03b3 ) \u03c3\u03b3+T \u2192A (E\u03b3 ) \u03b4 EAT (E\u03b3 ) \u2212 EA ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere EAT (E\u03b3 ) is the energy of the Ath species produced by the photodissociation reaction\n\u03b3 + T \u2192 A.

It\nis useful to use the mole fraction Yi \u2261 ni /nB of baryons in a particular nuclide, rather than\nthe absolute abundance. This allows us to take out the expansion effects, yielding\ndYA X\n=\nYT\ndt\nT\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\ndE\u03b3 N\u03b3QSE (E\u03b3 ) \u03c3\u03b3+T \u2192A (E\u03b3 )\n\n\u2212 YA\n\nXZ\nP\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\ndE\u03b3 N\u03b3QSE (E\u03b3 ) \u03c3\u03b3+A\u2192P (E\u03b3 ),\n\n(11)\n\nwhere nB is the baryon number density and d/dt is an ordinary time derivative. It is also\nconvenient to change from time differentiation to differentiation with respect to redshift, and\nalso to extract the factor nX E0 /\u03c4X out of N\u03b3QSE .

We should note\nthat, with these terms pulled out, the integrals become functions only of redshift, and the\ndependence on the properties of the decaying particle has been removed. This formulation\nis very useful in making the numerical implementation fast and efficient.\n\n2.3\n\nSecondary Element Production\n\nIn the previous Section we discussed the production of light elements by the photo-dissociation\nof heavier elements. However, the initial photo-production/destruction of light nuclei is not\nnecessarily the only process that happens before thermalization. The primary interactions\nproduce non-thermal particles, which then interact with the background plasma, degrading\ntheir energy. However, they may still have enough energy to initiate further, secondary\nnuclear interactions.\nWe now modify the evolution of the primary particles described in the previous section\nto include energy-degrading interactions:\n\u2202\ndNA\n[bA (EA )NA (EA )] ,\n(EA ) = JA (EA ) \u2212 NA (EA )\u0393A (EA ) \u2212\ndt\n\u2202EA\n\n5\n\n(15)\n\n\fTable 1: The relevant photo-dissociation reactions and their respective threshold energies are\nlisted in the Table below, and their cross sections are listed in Appendix A.\nReaction\nd(\u03b3,n)p\nt(\u03b3,n)d\nt(\u03b3,np)n\n3\nHe(\u03b3,p)d\n3\nHe(\u03b3,np)p\n4\nHe(\u03b3,p)t\n4\nHe(\u03b3,n)3 He\n4\nHe(\u03b3,d)d\n4\nHe(\u03b3,np)d\n6\nLi(\u03b3,np)4 He\n6\nLi(\u03b3,X)3 A\n7\nLi(\u03b3,t)4 He\n7\nLi(\u03b3,n)6 Li\n7\nLi(\u03b3,2np)4 He\n7\nBe(\u03b3,3 He)4 He\n7\nBe(\u03b3,p)6 Li\n7\nBe(\u03b3,2pn)4 He\n\nThreshold (E\u03b3,th )\n2.2246 MeV\n6.2572 MeV\n8.4818 MeV\n5.4935 MeV\n7.7181 MeV\n19.8139 MeV\n20.5776 MeV\n23.8465 MeV\n26.0711 MeV\n3.6989 MeV\n15.7947 MeV\n2.4670 MeV\n7.2400 MeV\n10.9489 MeV\n1.5866 MeV\n5.6058 MeV\n9.3047 MeV\n\n6\n\n\fwhere we have added the last term to include the energy degradation of the species A, where\nbA = \u2212dE/dt is the rate of energy loss. This term appears as an energy gradient, conserving\nparticle number in the absence of sources and sinks.\nIn most situations, the energy degradation rate is much faster than any sink, so that\nthe sinks can be ignored. For unstable particles, if the lifetime of the particle is comparable\nto the stopping time of that species, then the \u0393A term cannot be ignored. In general the\ninteractions are fast enough to reach a quasi-static equilibrium, but the form of the solution\nis somewhat more complicated than the photon case:\nNAQSE (EA )\n\n1\n=\nbA (EA )\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\"\n\n\u2032\n\ndEA exp \u2212\n\nEA\n\nZ\n\n\u2032\n\nEA\n\nEA\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n#\n\n\u0393A (EA )\n\u2032\nJA (EA ).\ndEA\n\u2032\u2032\nbA (EA )\n\u2032\u2032\n\n(16)\n\nSubstituting JA into this equation, we get\nNAQSE (EA )\n\nX\n1\n=\nnT\nbA (EA ) T\n\nZ\n\n\"\n\n\u221e\n\ndE\u03b3 N\u03b3 (E\u03b3 )\u03c3\u03b3+T \u2192A (E\u03b3 ) exp \u2212\n\n\u22121\nEA\n(EA )\n\nZ\n\nEA (E\u03b3 )\n\nEA\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n#\n\n\u0393A (EA )\ndEA\n.(17)\n\u2032\u2032\nbA (EA )\n\u2032\u2032\n\nWith this QSE solution in hand, we can determine the rate of secondary production of an\nelement S:\nX\ndNS\n(ES ) =\ndt sec\nT\u2032\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ndEA NAQSE (EA )\u0393A+T \u2032 \u2192S (EA )\u03b4 [ES (EA ) \u2212 ES ] .\n\n0\n\n(18)\n\nIntegrating over ES yields:\ndnS\ndt\n\n=\nsec\n\nX\nT\n\nZ\n\nnT \u2032\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\n\u2032\n\ndEA NAQSE (EA )\u03c3A+T \u2032 \u2192S (EA )|vA |.\n\n(19)\n\nAgain, using the mole baryon fraction to remove expansion effects from the differential\nequation, we obtain\ndYS\ndt\n\n=\nsec\n\nX\nT\n\nYT \u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\ndEA NAQSE (EA )\u03c3A+T \u2032 \u2192S (EA )|vA |.\n\n(20)\n\nAfter some algebraic manipulation, we obtain the following evolution equation for secondary\nproduction:\ndYS\ndz\n\u00d7\n\nZ\n\nsec\n\nrMX \u03b7(n0\u03b3 )2\n\u22121\n(1 + z)3 exp\n=\u2212\nHr \u03c4X\nHr \u03c4X (1 + z)2\n\n\u221e\n\ndE\u03b3\n\n\u22121\nEA\n(EA )\n\n\u0012\n\n\"\n\n\u0013\n\n!\n\n\u03c4X\nN QSE (E\u03b3 ) \u03c3\u03b3+T \u2192A (E\u03b3 ) exp \u2212\nE0 nX \u03b3\n\nX\n\nYT YT \u2032\n\nT,T \u2032\n\nZ\n\nEA (E\u03b3 )\n\nEA\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\ndEA\n\n\u03c3A+T \u2032 \u2192S (EA )|vA |\nbA (EA )\n\u2032\u2032\n\n#\n\n\u0393A (EA )\ndEA\n,\n\u2032\u2032\nbA (EA )\n\u2032\u2032\n\nwhere \u03b7 is the baryon-to-photon ratio: \u03b7 \u2261 n0B /n0\u03b3 .\nTable 2 lists the secondary reactions considered.

The only significant secondary production is that of 6 Li, as first shown\nin [12] and later in [13]. We show below that 6 Li actually provides the strongest constraint\nfor the lifetime range we are interested in. Note that the relevant threshold energies (Table\n2) are those in which the nuclei are in the cosmic rest frame, and thus are computed in the\nfixed-target laboratory frame. Consequently, these are about a factor of two higher than the\ncenter-of-mass thresholds used in [12] and [13].\n\n3\n\nObservational Constraints\n\nBefore we discuss the results of our numerical analysis, we first discuss the current status of\nthe observational determinations of the light-element abundances. The abundances subsequent to any photo-destruction/production must ultimately be related to these observations.\nFurthermore, our results are dependent on the assumed baryon-to-photon ratio, which may\neither be determined through the concordance of the BBN-produced abundances or through\nthe analysis of the CMB spectrum of anisotropies. As noted above, there is relatively good\nagreement between the two.\n\n3.1\n\nObserved Light Element Abundances\n\nThrough painstaking observations of very different astronomical environments, primordial\nabundances can be inferred for D, 4 He, and 7 Li. In addition, 3 He and 6 Li have also been\nmeasured, and can provide important supplementary constraints. Here we summarize the\ndata and our adopted limits: more detailed reviews appear in [15]. For all nuclides, accurate\nabundance measurements are challenging to obtain, due to systematic effects which arise\nfrom, e.g., an imperfect understanding of the astrophysical settings in which the observations\nare made, and from the process by which an abundance is inferred from an observed line\nstrength.\nDeuterium is measured in high-redshift QSO absorption line systems via its isotopic shift\nfrom hydrogen. In several absorbers of moderate column density (Lyman-limit systems), D\n\n8\n\n\fhas been observed in multiple Lyman transitions [42, 43]. Restricting our attention to the\nthree most reliable regions [42], we find a weighted mean of\n\u0012\n\nD\nH\n\n\u0013\n\np\n\n= (2.9 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 10\u22125 .\n\n(22)\n\nWe note, however, that the \u03c72 per degree of freedom is rather poor ( \u223c 3.4), and that the\nunweighted dispersion of these data is \u223c 0.6 \u00d7 10\u22125. This already points to the dominance\nof systematic effects. Observation of D in systems with higher column density (damped\nsystems) find lower D/H [44], at a level inconsistent with (22), further suggesting that\nsystematic effects dominate the error budget [45]. If we used all five available observations,\nwe would find D/H = (2.6 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 10\u22125 with an even worse \u03c72 per degree of freedom (\u223c 4.3)\nand an unweighted dispersion of 0.8. As an upper limit to D/H, we adopt the 2-\u03c3 upper\nlimit to the highest D/H value reliably observed, which is D/H = (4.0 \u00b1 0.65) \u00d7 10\u22125, since\nwe cannot definitively exclude the possibility that some D/H destruction has occurred in the\nother systems.\nWe also require a lower limit on the primordial D abundance. Since Galactic processes\nonly destroy D, its present abundance in the interstellar medium[46], D/H = (1.5\u00b10.1)\u00d710\u22125\nprovides an extreme lower limit on the primordial value, which is consistent with (22).\nTherefore, we adopt the limits\n1.3\u00d710\u22125 <\n\n\u0012\n\nD\nH\n\n\u0013\n\n< 5.3\u00d710\u22125 .\n\n(23)\n\np\n\nThis lower bound is quite conservative, in light of the fact that the existence of heavy elements\nconfirms that stellar processing and thus D destruction has certainly occurred at some level.\nUnlike D, 4 He is made in stars, and thus co-produced with heavy elements. Hence the\nbest sites for determining the primordial 4 He abundance are in metal-poor regions of hot,\nionized gas in nearby external galaxies (extragalactic HII regions). Helium indeed shows a\nlinear correlation with metallicity in these systems, and the extrapolation to zero metallicity\ngives the primordial abundance (baryonic mass fraction) [47]\nYp = 0.238 \u00b1 0.002 \u00b1 0.005.\n\n(24)\n\nHere, the first error is statistical and reflects the large sample of systems, whilst the second\nerror is systematic and dominates.\nThe systematic uncertainties in these observations have not been thoroughly explored to\ndate [48]. In particular, there may be reason to suspect that the above primordial abundance\nwill be increased due to effects such as underlying stellar absorption in the HII regions. We\nnote that other analyses give similar results: Yp = 0.244 \u00b1 0.002 \u00b1 0.005 [49] and 0.239\n\u00b10.002 [50]. For concreteness, we use the 4 He abundance in (24) to obtain the range\n0.227 < Yp < 0.249,\n\n(25)\n\ntaking the 2-\u03c3 range with errors added in quadrature.\nHelium-3 can be measured through its hyperfine emission in the radio band, and has\nbeen observed in HII regions in our Galaxy. These observations find [51] that there are no\n9\n\n\fobvious trends in 3 He with metallicity and location in the Galaxy, but rather a 3 He 'plateau'.\nThere is, however, considerable scatter in the data by a factor \u223c 2, some of which may be\nreal. Unfortunately, the stellar and Galactic evolution of 3 He is not yet sufficiently well\nunderstood to confirm whether 3 He is increasing or decreasing from its primordial value [23].\nConsequently, it is unclear whether the observed 3 He 'plateau' (if it is such) represents an\nupper or lower limit to the primordial value. Therefore, we do not use 3 He abundance as\na constraint. If future observations of 3 He could firmly establish the nature of its Galactic\nevolution, then 3 He could be restored as a useful constraint on decaying particles, particularly\nin concert with D.\nThe primordial 7 Li abundance comes from measurements in the atmospheres of primitive\n(Population II) stars in the stellar halo of our Galaxy. The 7 Li/H abundance is found to\nbe constant for stars with low metallicity, indicating a primordial component, and a recent\ndetermination gives\n7\n\nLi\nH\n\n!\n\np\n\n\u221210\n= (1.23 \u00b1 0.06+0.68\n(95% CL),\n\u22120.32 )\u00d710\n\n(26)\n\nwhere the small statistical error is overshadowed by systematic uncertainties [52]. The range\n(26) may, however, be underestimated, as a recent determination [53] uses a different procedure to determine stellar atmosphere parameters, and gives 7 Li/Hp = (2.19 \u00b1 0.28) \u00d7 10\u221210 .\nAt this stage, it is not possible to determine which method of analysis is more accurate,\nindicating the likelihood that the upper systematic uncertainty in (26) has been underestimated. Thus, in order to obtain a conservative bound from 7 Li, we take the lower bound\n(once again combining the statistical and systematic errors in quadrature) from (26) and the\nupper bound from [53], giving\n9.0\u00d710\u221211 <\n\n7\n\nLi\nH\n\n!\n\n< 2.8\u00d710\u221210 .\n\n(27)\n\np\n\nFinally, 6 Li is also measured in halo stars, in which the 6 Li/7 Li ratio is inferred from\nthe (thermally blended) isotopic line splitting. The lowest 6 Li abudances comes from stars\nwith primordial Li, which yield 6 Li/7 Li = 0.05 \u00b1 0.01 [54]. The 6 Li in these stars is not\nprimordial, as it is produced by cosmic-ray interactions with the interstellar medium [55],\npredominantly \u03b1\u03b1 \u2192 6 Li + * * *. These same processes lead to the production of Be and B,\nwhich are observed in halo stars at levels consistent with 6 Li cosmic-ray production. Since\nthe observed 6 Li abundances are consistent with being entirely Galactic in origin, we can\nuse these to set an extreme upper limit on the primordial 6 Li abundance. One complication\nenters, due to the smaller binding energy of 6 Li relative to 7 Li. This means that 6 Li could in\nprinciple suffer depletion in stars due to nuclear burning, without a similar depletion of 7 Li.\nHowever, once nuclear burning becomes effective, 6 Li depletion factors become extrelemly\nlarge making such observations extremely unlikely [56]. It is therefore safe to use the 2-\u03c3\nupper bound on the 6 Li/7 Li ratio\n6\n\nLi\n7\nLi\n\n!\n\n<\n\u223c 0.07.\n\n(28)\n10\n\n\fOther depletion processes such as diffusion (included in the estimate of systematic uncertainties in (26)), would affect both 6 Li and 7 Li similarly and not their ratio. It is also useful\nto consider the upper bound on 6 Li/H alone\n6\n\nLi\nH\n\n!\n\n3.2\n\np\n\n\u221211\n<\n\u223c 2 \u00d7 10 .\n\n(29)\n\nCosmic Microwave Background Anisotropy Measurements\n\nCosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy data are now reaching the precision where\nthey can provide an accurate measure of the cosmic baryon content. Given a CMB measurement of \u03b7, one can use BBN to make definite predictions of the light element abundances,\nwhich can then be compared with the observations discussed above. This comparison constrains the effects of decaying particles more powerfully than if only the BBN calculations\nwere available to constrain \u03b7.\nRecent results from DASI [18] and CBI [19] indicate that \u03a9B h2 = 0.022+0.004\n\u22120.003 , while\nBOOMERanG-98 [20] gives \u03a9B h2 = 0.021+0.004\n.\nThese\ndeterminations\nare\nsomewhat\nlower\n\u22120.003\n+0.010\n2\nthan the central values found by MAXIMA-1 [21]: \u03a9B h = 0.026\u22120.006 and VSA [22]: \u03a9B h2 =\n0.029 \u00b1 0.009. Taking a CMB value of\n\u03a9B h2 = 0.022 \u00b1 0.003\n\nor\n\n\u03b710,cmb = 6.0 \u00b1 0.8\n\n(30)\n\nat the 1-\u03c3 level, we would predict the following light element abundances:\n4\n\nHe :\nD/H \u00d7 105 :\n3\nHe/H \u00d7 105 :\n7\nLi/H \u00d7 1010 :\n\n0.248 \u00b1 0.001 (68% CL)\n2.7+0.9\n\u22120.3 (68% CL)\n0.9 \u00b1 0.1 (68% CL)\n3.4+1.5\n\u22120.8 (68% CL)\n\n(31)\n(32)\n(33)\n(34)\n\nNote that these numbers are not outputs of BBN calculations corresponding to \u03b710 = 6.0,\nbut rather are the peak values of a likelihood function found by convolving the results of\nthe BBN Monte Carlo with an assumed Gaussian for the distribution of CMB \u03b7 values. For\nfurther details, see [16, 17]. With MAP data, the accuracy of \u03b7cmb should be 10% or better,\nwhich will give even tighter predictions on the light elements.\n\n4\n\nModel Results\n\nWe have implemented numerically the decaying-particle cascades discussed in Section 2.\nUsing BBN light-element abundance predictions [16] as initial conditions, we calculate the\nfinal abundances for particular sets of baryon and dark matter parameters. The three free\nparameters are:\n\u03b6X \u2261\n\nn0X\nMX = rMX = 2rE0 ,\nn0\u03b3\n\n(35)\n\n\u03c4X and \u03b7.\n11\n\n\f4.1\n\nAnalytic Discussion\n\nSome simple analytic approximations allow us to gain insight into the essential physics in\nour problem. As we will see, the following analytic treatment reproduces well the behavior\nof the light element abundance mountains and deserts in our parameter space.\nThe dependence on \u03c4X can be understood [11] in terms of the characteristic energy scales\nin the photon spectrum (4). Both the break EX and the cutoff EC scale as Ei \u221d 1/T .\nThus, in the 'uniform decay' approximation where all particles decay at t = \u03c4X , the decay\noccurs at T \u223c 10\u22124 MeV (\u03c4X /108 s)\u22121/2 . Consequently, we have EX \u223c 28 MeV (\u03c4X /108 s)1/2 ,\nand EC \u223c 103 MeV (\u03c4X /108 s)1/2 , and cutoffs thus increase with \u03c4X . In other words, higherenergy photo-erosion processes can occur for longer lifetime values. Comparison with Table 1\nshows that, as \u03c4X increases, first EC and then EX pass the threshold energy Eth for any\ngiven process, at which point the process becomes important. A reaction can turn on when\nEC >\n\u223c Eth , which in the uniform decay approximation occurs when\n6\n\n\u03c4X >\n\u223c 10 s\n\n\u0012\n\nEth\n10 MeV\n\n\u00132\n\n,\n\n(36)\n\nwhile for shorter \u03c4X the channel is closed. The reaction grows stronger when EX >\n\u223c Eth ,\nwhich occurs when\n7\n\n\u03c4X \u223c 10 s\n\n\u0012\n\nEth\n10 MeV\n\n\u00132\n\n.\n\n(37)\n\nWe can also understand the \u03b6X dependence of photodestruction (and secondary production)\nanalytically, as follows. In the limit of small \u03b6X , the decaying particle has no influence on the\nlight-element abundances as predicted by primordial nucleosynthesis, predicting a universe\nmade of mostly hydrogen and 4 He, with small but significant amounts of D, 3 He, and 7 Li.\nLithium-6 is not produced in significant quantities. Going beyond this trivial case we use a\nsimilar treatment as above, and employ the uniform decay approximation. To begin, as long\nas a reaction can proceed, a typical shower photon has energy\n\u0012\n\nEth\nhEi = 56 MeV\n10 MeV\n\n\u0013 12 \u0012\n\n\u03c4X\n108 s\n\n\u00131\n4\n\n,\n\n(38)\n\nso that the number of such photons per decay is N\u03b3 \u223c E0 /hEi. Had the lower-energy piece of\nthe power law been much steeper (i.e., with a power index p > 2) we would have hEi \u223c Eth ,\nand if it was much shallower (i.e., p < 1) we would have hEi \u223c EX . However, we lie in an\ninteresting regime where hEi \u223c (Eth /EX )P \u22121 EX , where 1 < p < 2. Thus the nonthermal\nphoton density is\nninj\n\u03b3 = N\u03b3 nX =\n\n\u03b6X nBG\n\u03b3\n.\n2hEi\n\n(39)\n\nThese photons are thermalized at a rate per photon of \u0393therm \u223c ne \u03c3T \u223c nB \u03c3T . The rate\nper photon for the photodestruction of species T to yield species P is \u0393T \u2192P \u223c nT \u03c3T \u2192P =\nfT \u2192P YT \u0393therm , where YT = nT /nB , and fT \u2192P = \u03c3T \u2192P /\u03c3T is the relative strength of the cross\n12\n\n\fsection for photodestruction of T into P , compared with the thermalization cross section,\nwhich we take as the Thompson cross section for this discussion. Consequently, the change\nin the number density of A is the net production rate per volume (\u0393T \u2192A \u2212 \u0393A\u2192P )ninj\n\u03b3 times\n\u22121\nthe loss time \u0393therm , or\n\u03b4nA = nB \u03b4YA \u223c ninj\n\u03b3\n\n(\u0393T \u2192A \u2212 \u0393A\u2192P )\n.\n\u0393therm\n\n(40)\n\nWe see that the fractional change in an abundance is given by\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03b4YA\nYT\n\u03b6X\n\u223c\nfT \u2192A \u2212 fA\u2192P .\nYA\n2\u03b7hEi YA\n\n(41)\n\nIf we look at the two extremes when either production or destruction dominates, we can\nderive the behavior of \u03b6X , given that the fractional change in the abundance is \u223c 1/2:\nprod\n\u03b6X\n\ndest\n\u03b6X\n\n\u223c 3.2\u00d710\n\n\u221211\n\n\u223c 6.3\u00d710\n\n\u22128\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n5.0\u00d710\u22124\n5000\nGeV \uf8ed YT \uf8f8\nfT \u2192A\nY\nA\n\n5.0\u00d710\u22124\nGeV\nfA\u2192P\n\n!\u0012\n\n\u03b710\n6\n\n!\u0012\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\n\u03b710\n6\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\nEth\n20 MeV\n\nEth\n2.224 MeV\n\n\u0013 12 \u0012\n\n\u0013 21 \u0012\n\n\u03c4X\n108 s\n\n\u03c4X\n108 s\n\n\u00131\n4\n\n,\n\n\u00131\n4\n\n,\n\n(42)\n(43)\n\nwhere the numbers are those appropriate for D.\nThis same treatment can be extended to secondary production of light elements. Since 6 Li\nis the only significant secondary production, this is the only example we consider here. In this\ncase, only a fraction of the primary products have enough energy for this reaction to proceed,\nbecause of interactions with the background plasma. We estimate as follows the fraction that\ncan react to form 6 Li. Each prospective reactant is produced with initial energy EA (hEi), and\nthe total amount of energy that can be lost between collisions is Eloss = bA (hEi)/nB \u03c3T |vA |.\nThe fraction of reactants left is the ratio of these two energies, NP \u223c EA (hEi)/Eloss \u223c 0.001.\nThus the number density of these remaining non-thermal particles is\nninj\nP = NP \u03b4nA \u223c NP\n\n\u03b6X YT nB\nfT \u2192A .\n2\u03b7hEi\n\n(44)\n\nThe rate per particle can be described in a similar way as before, where \u0393A\u2192S = fA\u2192S YT \u2032 \u0393therm \u03b2.\nSince these particles are non-relativistic, there is a factor \u03b2 = v/c in the interaction rate.\nWe can thus determine the change in abundance of the secondary species:\n\u03b4nS \u223c nB \u03b4YS \u223c ninj\nP\n\n\u0393A\u2192S\n.\n\u0393therm\n\n(45)\n\nThe fractional change in the abundance is then given by\n\u03b6X YT YT \u2032\n\u03b4YS\n\u223c NP\nfT \u2192A fA\u2192S \u03b2.\nYS\n2\u03b7hEiYS\n\n(46)\n\n13\n\n\fFigure 1: Contours of the 4 He mass fraction Yp (a) in the (\u03b6X , \u03c4X ) plane, for \u03b710 = 6, and\n(b) in the (\u03b6X , \u03b7) plane, for \u03c4X = 108 sec.

This weakens the dependence of the reaction\nrates on the baryon density.\nWe now turn to the full numerical results, using these analytical estimates as a guide to\ninterpretation.\n\n4.2\n\nNumerical Results\n\nOur numerical results come from the integration of (12) and (21), using the input spectra\nof (4). We present our results by showing abundance contours in \u03b6X \u2212 \u03c4X space at fixed\n\u03b710 = 6, and in \u03b6X \u2212 \u03b7 space at fixed \u03c4X = 108 s. A key innovation of the present work is a\ndetailed fitting of the energy dependence of the relevant cross sections. These are discussed\nin Appendix A, which also contains fitting formulae.\n\n14\n\n\fFigure 2: Deuterium abundance contours plotted as in Fig. 1.\nWe begin our discussion with the most abundant compound nucleus, namely 4 He. Since\nthe other light elements are predicted by BBN to have abundances that are orders of magnitude smaller than 4 He, no significant production of 4 He can take place. Thus electromagnetic\nshowers from decaying particles can only destroy 4 He. These photodestruction processes have\nan energy threshold of Eth \u223c 20 MeV and so, from (36), we expect this process to become in6\n5\nefficient for \u03c4X <\n\u223c 4 \u00d7 10 s, and to shut down completely when \u03c4X <\n\u223c 4 \u00d7 10 seconds. Indeed,\nthis is what is seen in Fig. 1(a), where we plot contours of Yp in the (\u03b6X , \u03c4X ) plane for \u03b710 = 6,\n6\n4\nthe value preferred by CMB analyses (30). For \u03c4X >\n\u223c 4 \u00d7 10 s, the He destruction factor\n\u221210\ngoes from a small perturbation to a large one as \u03b6X grows from 10\nto 10\u22129 GeV, until the\n\u22128\n4\n5\n6\nregion \u03b6X >\n\u223c 10 GeV becomes a He 'desert'. Over the region \u03c4X \u223c 4 \u00d7 10 s \u2212 4 \u00d7 10 s,\n4\nHe destruction becomes important only at increasingly high \u03b6X . This general behavior has\nan impact on all of the other light elements, as 4 He is the only important source for them.\nIn Fig. 1(b), we again plot contours of Yp , but now in the (\u03b6X , \u03b7) plane for \u03c4X = 108 s.\nWe see the generic features mentioned above, that for low \u03b6X 4 He is at its BBN predicted\nvalue and for very large \u03b6X it is destroyed. At large \u03b7, the non-thermal photons are more\nquickly thermalized, thus having less energy on average and making it more difficult to\ndestroy nuclei. This linear rise is as predicted in (42).\nFig. 2 plots the corresponding contours of D/H. Several distinct regions are apparent. For\n\u221211\nGeV, the decaying particles make only a small perturbation\nall \u03c4X , in the region \u03b6X <\n\u223c 10\n\u221211\nGeV, the decaying particles can\nto the primordial value of D/H. For values of \u03b6X >\n\u223c 10\n15\n\n\flead to significant perturbations to D/H, the sign and magnitude of which depend strongly\non \u03c4X . In the case of D, the important production processes are due to 4 He + \u03b3: the other\nlight elements have negligible abundances compared to 4 He, and thus are unimportant as\nD sources. The D production channels have thresholds Eth \u223c 25 MeV, so we expect these\n6\nprocess to become inefficient for \u03c4X <\n\u223c 5 \u00d7 10 s. Furthermore, production is only efficient\n\u22129\nwhen 4 He destruction is not large, i.e., when \u03b6X <\n\u223c 10 GeV. Of course, D production can\n4\nonly occur when there is sufficient He destruction, so we expect significant production to\noccur only up to some maximum \u03b6X . For higher \u03b6X , photo-destruction becomes so dominant\nthat any production yields are immediately broken up via further photo-destruction reactions, leaving a universe filled with only protons. Thus, as \u03b6X increases, the D/H abundance\nrapidly declines, dropping to and then below its primordial abundance, to approach zero in\na D 'desert'. Thus, we expect D production only in a region bounded from above and below\n6\nin \u03b6X , and to the left by \u03c4X <\n\u223c 4 \u00d7 10 s. These expectations are met by the D/H 'mountain'\nin Fig. 2, which stretches between \u03b6X = 10\u221210 GeV to \u03b6X = 10\u22128 GeV.\n6\n4\nFor \u03c4X <\n\u223c 5 \u00d7 10 s, D production from He does not occur. Since the photo-destruction\nprocesses d(\u03b3, n)p has a threshold of Eth = 2.224 MeV (the D binding energy), D destruction\n3\ndrops out at \u03c4X <\n\u223c 4 \u00d7 10 s, as seen in Fig. 2. Finally, note that the competing processes of\nD production and destruction balance for some regions of parameter space, where D retains\nits primordial values. These are the 'channels' which separate the regions we have already\ndiscussed.\nIn Fig. 2(b), the contours of D/H are shown in the (\u03b6X , \u03b7) plane for \u03c4X = 108 s. Just like\n4\nHe, these D contours show the features sketched out in our analytic discussion. For low \u03b6X , D\nis at its BBN value. At intermediate values, we are climbing the photo-production mountain.\nAt even higher values of \u03b6X , we enter the photo-erosion desert. Again the dependences on \u03b7\nare entirely due to the photon energy-loss mechanism being more efficient at higher baryon\ndensity.\nResults for 7 Li/H are shown in Fig. 3. We see that the results are qualitatively similar to\nthose for 4 He, reflecting the fact that secondary 7 Li production is negligible. Since 7 Li is only\ndestroyed, its weak binding compared to 4 He leads to the wider expanse of the 7 Li 'desert'.\nAs mentioned earlier, we considered the secondary production of 7 Li, through the reactions\n4\nHe(t,\u03b3)7 Li and 4 He(3 He,\u03b3)7 Be. These reactions have no energy threshold, only a strong\nCoulomb barrier, so a priori they would seem important. However, the net production of\n7\nLi through these reactions is small compared to its primordial value set by BBN. This is\ndue to the small cross sections for mass-7 production.\nUnlike 7 Li, standard BBN does not produce 6 Li in any observable quantity, so any other\nproduction mechanism is important. The behavior of 6 Li, seen in Fig. 4a, can be understood\nin terms of the 4 He and 7 Li dynamics, because these are the two 6 Li sources. As with\nD, we see a roughly horizontal 'mountain' of 6 Li production, which is bounded on the left\nby threshold effects. The dominant production channel is from secondary reactions, and\nthus is tied to the 4 He destruction threshold. The secondary reactions 4 He(t,n)6 Li and\n4\nHe(3 He,p)6 Li, also have low energy resonances, further increasing their yields. The 6 Li\nproduction from 7 Li and 7 Be, however, has lower thresholds, and thus becomes dominant for\n7\n7\nsmall lifetimes, \u03c4X <\n\u223c 10 s. These channels are important where Li destruction is moderate\n16\n\n\fFigure 3: Contours of 7 Li/H, plotted as in Fig. 1.\n\n17\n\n\fFigure 4: Contours of 6 Li/H, plotted as in Fig. 1.\n\n18\n\n\fFigure 5: Contours of 6 Li/7 Li, plotted as in Fig. 1.\nbut still sufficient to make significant amounts of 6 Li, leading to a break in the slope of the\n6\nLi curve at \u03b6X \u223c 10\u221211 . The inclusion of two 6 Li destruction channels leads to the 'nose'\nat \u03b6X \u223c 10\u22127 GeV and \u03c4X \u223c 107 s. This feature is absent in the 6 Li plot in [13], since there\nonly a single destruction channel was considered.\nIn Fig. 4b we see that the secondary production dominates the evolution of 6 Li for quite\nlow \u03b6X . Since the 6 Li secondary-production cross sections have thresholds, the average\ninitiating photon energy must be higher than in the standard photo-destruction process.\nIn this higher-energy regime, double-photon scattering is comparable to the other photon\nenergy-loss mechanisms. This reduces the dependence on the baryon density, effectively\nflattening out the contours in the (\u03b6X , \u03b7) plane where secondary production is important.\nAt higher \u03b6X , photo-destruction of 6 Li takes over, taking us to the 6 Li desert.\nAs noted in [11], the 6 Li/7 Li ratio offers additional constraints besides those provided\nby each nuclide separately. We plot 6 Li/7 Li contours in Fig. 5, where we see that these are\nsmoother than the contours for 6 Li alone. Because 6 Li dissociation has a higher threshold\nthan 7 Li - see Table 1 - 6 Li/7 Li is large in the 'desert' region of high \u03b6X , though each\nindividual abundance is quite small. For smaller \u03b6X , 6 Li increases with \u03b6X , while 7 Li either\nremains constant or decreases. The upshot is that 6 Li/7 Li grows with \u03b6X , as seen in Fig. 5.\nHaving described the physics that leads to the abundance patterns we have computed, we\ncan now discuss how this physics allows the observed abundances to place constraints on decaying particles. To obtain these constraints, we combine this analysis with the observational\n19\n\n\fdata discussed previously.\n\n5\n\nLimits on Unstable Relic Particles\n\nWe now impose the observed light-element abundance constraints of Section 3.1 with the\nresults of the previous section. We do this for each element individually, then combine the\nresults to obtain the strongest constraints.\nWe remind the reader that light element constraints on decaying particles depend on\n\u03b7, but of course one cannot use the standard BBN limits on \u03b7 as part of ones limits. In\nthe past, this difficulty has only been overcome by adopting limits on \u03b7 derived from nonnucleosynthetic arguments. These limits have, until recently, been rather weak, which has\nweakened the power of the light element constraints. This situation has now changed drastically. We recall that the CMB now imposes \u03b710 \u2243 6 with rather small uncertainty. Thus,\nif we adopt the CMB results, we no longer must treat \u03b7 as weakly constrained by non-BBN\narguments, strengthening the results we derive.\nWe quote limits for \u03b710 = 6, and emphasize results for \u03c4X = 108 s, which is roughly the\nlifetime for which the constraints are the strongest, and is also within the range of current\ninterest for gravitino decays. Results at lower \u03c4X weaken rapidly, while the constraints at\n1/4\nhigher \u03c4X scale roughly as \u03c4X , as in (42), (43) and (47).\nAlso, the current observational status of standard BBN comes into play. Namely, the\npresent observational data on 4 He and 7 Li are in tension with those for D, the former preferring \u03b710 \u223c 3 and the latter \u03b710 \u223c 6. On the one hand, if standard BBN is correct and\nthe tension is due to systematic errors, the result is that these errors weaken the constraints\nthat one can place on decaying particles. On the other hand, if the observations were to\nimprove to the point that the light-element disagreement can no longer be accommodated,\nthis could herald new physics. In this case, decaying particles offer a way [11] of reconciling\nthe abundances of the light elements, in which case one also derives estimates of the required\n\u03b6X and \u03c4X .\nWe turn first to the elements which are only destroyed, namely 4 He and 7 Li. The observed\nconstraints on 4 He (25) give\n\u03b6X (4 He) < 2.5\u00d710\u221210 GeV,\n\n(48)\n\nwhich is driven by the lower limit Yp > 0.227 that we adopted. The sharp drop of 4 He with\nincreasing \u03b6X (i.e., the descent into the desert of Fig. 1) ensures that the constraint on \u03b6X\nis insensitive to the precise Yp limit chosen. The situation is similar for 7 Li, for which (27)\ngive the weaker constraint\n\u03b6X (7 Li) < 2\u00d710\u22129 GeV.\n\n(49)\n\nFor deuterium, net production and net destruction are both possible. In terms of Fig.\n2, this means that limits on D exclude the ridge in the D mountain, while allowing regions\nat higher and lower \u03b6X . In particular, the observed D abundances (22) allow the range\n\n20\n\n\fFigure 6: Exclusion limits based on deuterium are shown in (a) the (\u03b6X , \u03c4X ) plane for \u03b710 = 6\n(b) the (\u03b6X , \u03b7) plane for \u03c4X = 108 s. The dark (blue) shaded region corresponds to an\noverabundance of D/H, while the light (blue) shaded region corresponds to an underabundance\nof D/H.\n\u22128\n4\n7\n2\u00d710\u22128 GeV <\n\u223c \u03b6X <\n\u223c 3\u00d710 GeV, but the He and Li constraints are each able to exclude\nthis regime. Consequently, the only remaining region is the low-\u03b6 side of the mountain,\n\n\u03b6X (D) < 3\u00d710\u221211 GeV.\n\n(50)\n\nThe since 6 Li is not produced significantly in standard BBN, only production is important\nfor low \u03b6X , while for higher \u03b6X destruction dominates. Thus, the situation is similar to that\nof D: there is a 6 Li mountain, with the observations allowing a narrow high-\u03b6X region and a\nlarge low-\u03b6X region. The 6 Li/H abundance of (29) gives\n\u03b6X (6 Li) < 5\u00d710\u221212 GeV\n\n(51)\n\nin addition to a higher region that is discordant with 4 He and 7 Li. The 6 Li/7 Li ratio (28)\ngives\n\u03b6X (6 Li/7 Li) < 7.0\u00d710\u221212 GeV.\n\n(52)\n\nFigure 6 summarizes our results for the constraints based on D/H in both the (\u03b6X , \u03c4X )\nplane (for \u03b710 = 6) and the (\u03b6X , \u03b7) plane for \u03c4X = 108 s. The dark (blue) shaded regions\n21\n\n\fFigure 7: As in Figure 6, including the constraints from 4 He - medium (pink) shading and\nLi - medium-light (green) shading.\n\n7\n\ncorrespond to an overabundance of D/H, i.e. regions where there is net production of deuterium. The lighter (blue) shaded regions represent an underabundance of D/H or regions\nwhere there is net destruction of deuterium. Notice that the thin strips which are unshaded\nfor which the D/H abundance is acceptable. These will be excluded when the constraints\nfrom the other light elements are included.\nIn Figure 7, we include the constraints from 4 He and 7 Li. Here we superimpose the 4 He\nconstraint, shown as the medium shaded (pink) region. and the 7 Li constraint, shown as the\nmedium-light (green) shaded region, on the D/H constraints. We see that D, 4 He, and 7 Li\nalone, i.e., primordial species, impose a limit of\n\u221211\n\u03b6X <\nGeV,\n\u223c \u03b6max = 3.5\u00d710\n\n(53)\n\n\u221212\n\u03b6X <\nGeV\n\u223c \u03b6max = 5\u00d710\n\n(54)\n\nwhich is dominated by the limits from D. We can do better if we include 6 Li. Our limit\n6\n\u221212\nLi/H <\npushes the above constraint down to\n\u223c 2 \u00d7 10\nfor \u03c4X = 108 s as seen in Figure 8 by the dark (red) shaded region. The constraint from\nthe 6 Li/7 Li ratio is shown as the light (yellow) shaded region. Notice that it becomes the\nstronger constraint at \u03b7 < 5.0.\n22\n\n\fFigure 8: As in Figures 6 and 7 including the constraints from 6 Li (dark red).\nThese constraints are subject to uncertainties in the 6 Li limit, due both to the possible\nstellar depletion of 6 Li and the known Galactic production of 6 Li by cosmic rays. Our limit is\nintended conservatively to allow for both effects. Even so, we see the power of 6 Li. We thus\nurge further observations of the Li isotopic ratio, as a firmer understanding of this nuclide\ncould further strengthen the constraint we have derived.\nAs already noted, if the observed light-element abundances retain their current central\nvalues, but the error budget shrinks, then the light-element data will be in discord with\nstandard BBN. Decaying particles might provide one possible means of reconciling such\nlight-element observations and theory. As an illustrative example, consider the case in which\nthe CMB fixes \u03b710 = 6, and the observed light element abundances remain as above, but\nwith the total error budget equal to that of the current statistical errors. Then 7 Li and D\nwould be in significant disagreement. One could, however, bring these nuclides and 4 He into\nagreement by appealing to the decaying-particle scenario we have laid out here, the allowed\nregion of parameter space still open being one in which a non-zero \u03b6X is preferred. The\nnew 7 Li upper limit would eliminate low values of \u03b6X , allowing only a narrow band with\n\u03b6 \u2248 10\u22129 . The observations would force us to live in the narrow channel where D production\nand destruction are nearly balanced, with a decaying particle lifetime \u03c4X \u2248 3\u00d7106 sec. In\nthis regime, 4 He is at its BBN value, because of its high photoerosion threshold, shown\nin Table 1. However, the more weakly bound 7 Li is destroyed, at just the right level to\nbring the observations in accord with the D observations. This rather fine-tuned scenario is\n23\n\n\ftestable with 6 Li observations. In this region of parameter space, we predict a 6 Li abundance\nof 6 Li/H \u2248 10\u221211 and 6 Li/7 Li \u2248 0.03. This 6 Li abundance would appear as a pre-Galactic\nplateau in halo stars. Indeed, the 6 Li level would be large enough to dominate the cosmic-ray\ncomponent of 6 Li over most of the Population II metallicity range.\n\n6\n\nApplication to Cosmological Gravitinos\n\nWe now illustrate the impact of our calculations by discussing their implications for cosmological gravitinos. In conventional supergravity scenarios, the gravitino is expected to have\na mass comparable to that of supersymmetric partners of standard Model particles, which\nshould weigh less than about 1 TeV if they are to stabilize the gauge hierarchy [57]. Therefore, the gravitino is usually thought to weigh between about 100 GeV to 10 TeV, though\nboth larger and smaller masses have sometimes been considered. The lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is generally thought to be the lightest neutralino \u03c7, a model-dependent\nmixture of the photino \u03b3\u0303, the zino Z\u0303 and the neutral Higgsinos H\u03031,2 [58]. The LSP would\nbe stable in models in which R parity is conserved, as we assume here. On the other hand,\nthe gravitino would be unstable, with a partial G\u0303 \u2192 \u03c7 + \u03b3 decay rate calculated to be\n1\n\u0393(G\u0303 \u2192 \u03c7\u03b3) =\n4\n\n!\n\nMG\u03033\n2\nO\u03c7\u03b3\n,\n2\nMP\n\n(55)\n\nwhere O\u03c7\u03b3 is the fraction of \u03b3\u0303 in the wave function of the LSP \u03c7, and MP is the Planck\nmass. In many models, the LSP is essentially a pure U(1) gaugino (Bino) B\u0303, in which case\nO\u03c7\u03b3 = cos2 \u03b8W and the neutralino mixing does not suppress the gravitino decay rate (55).\nWe assume for now that \u03c7 = B\u0303 and that no other gravitino decay modes are significant, in\nwhich case the gravitino lifetime is\n\u03c4G\u0303 = 2.9 \u00d7 10\n\n8\n\n100 GeV\nMG\u0303\n\n!3\n\ns.\n\n(56)\n\nWe discuss later the modifications to our analysis needed if the LSP is essentially a pure\nHiggsino, another possibility sometimes considered, or if other decay modes are open to the\ngravitino.\nThe production of gravitinos in the early Universe has been the subject of heated discussion. An unavoidable contribution is thermal production [59, 8, 60, 61]. Here, we will apply\nour results in combination with the recent calculation in [61], which gives\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nme2g\nnG\u0303\nTR\n\u221211 \uf8ed\n\uf8f8\nYG\u0303 \u2261\n= 1.2 \u00d7 10\n\u00d7\n1+\nn\u03b3\n12m2G\u0303\n1010 GeV\n\n(57)\n\nwhere TR is the maximum temperature reached in the early Universe4 . In conventional inflationary cosmology, TR is the reheating temperature achieved at the end of the inflationary\n4\n\nWe note that this calculation is based on the dominant strong contributions to gravitino production.\nElectroweak corrections would enhance the production rate by about 5 \u2013 20 %.\n\n24\n\n\fepoch. In some inflationary scenarios, there may be additional gravitino production, either\nduring the inflationary epoch or later, before thermalization is achieved. Either of these effects would only accentuate the potential problem we discuss below, and we do not consider\nsuch possibilities here.\nIn (57), meg is the low-energy gluino mass. In supersymmetric models with gaugino mass\nunification, there is a definite relation between the gluino mass and the bino mass, which, at\nthe one-loop order sufficient for our purposes, is meg /mBe \u2243 \u03b13 (meg )/\u03b11 . Typically, this ratio\nis between 5 and 6. If the bino is the LSP, as we are presently considering, then mG\u0303 \u2265 mBe .\nThe middle term in (57) is therefore never larger than 4, and tends to unity for large gravitino\nmasses. Thus we estimate\nYG\u0303 \u2243 (0.7 \u2212 2.7) \u00d7 10\n\n\u221211\n\n\u0012\n\nTR\n\u00d7\n10\n10 GeV\n\n\u0013\n\n(58)\n\nin this case.\nThe upper limit (1) can be expressed as a limit on YG\u0303 :\nYG\u0303 < 5 \u00d7 10\n\n\u221214\n\n100 GeV\n\u00d7\nmG\u0303\n\n!\n\n(59)\n\nComparing the calculated abundance (58) with the upper limit (59), we infer the following\nupper limit on the reheating temperature TR , for MG\u0303 \u223c 100 GeV:\nTR < (1.9 \u2212 7.5) \u00d7 107 GeV\n\n(60)\n\nThis upper limit is far smaller than the reheating temperature TR \u223c 1012 GeV expected in\nconventional inflationary scenarios. As noted in the introduction, this bound places important constraints on models of baryo/leptogenesis.\nWe recall that the upper limit (60) comes from a combination of data and calculations of\ndifferent light-element abundances. It could not be obtained by considering the deuterium\nabundance alone, as this would allow a 'tail' of the parameter space extending to large\ngravitino abundances YG\u0303 , as well as an isolated 'channel' at large YG\u0303 . The 'tail' cannot\nbe excluded just by considering also the abundance of 4 He, though the 'channel' probably\ncan. However, as discussed earlier, the 'tail' can be excluded by also considering the 6 Li\nabundance. We have already discussed why we think that measurements of the relevant\nphotoreaction cross sections and the astrophysical data are now sufficiently reliable for the\n6\nLi data to be regarded as a serious constraint.\nAs we commented at the end of the previous Section, if the observed light-element abundances were to retain their current central values while the error budget shrank, the lightelement data would become inconsistent with standard BBN, and decaying particles might\nbe able to reconcile such light-element observations with theory. This scenario would predict\na lifetime \u03c4G\u0303 \u2248 3\u00d7106 sec and an abundance \u03b6G\u0303 \u2248 10\u22129 GeV. These constraints would place\nthe gravitino mass at MG\u0303 \u2248 460 GeV, with a relic abundance of YG\u0303 \u2248 2\u00d710\u221212 , corresponding\nin turn to a reheating temperature TR \u2243 (0.8 \u2212 3.1)\u00d7109 GeV.\nHow might the potentially embarrassing conclusion (60) be avoided or evaded?\n\n25\n\n\fThe first option one might consider is diluting the density of gravitinos by several orders\nof magnitude some time between their production at a temperature close to TR and the\nperiod when they decay. This large entropy release should certainly occur before BBN, i.e.,\nwhen the age t <\n\u223c 1 s, in order to avoid destroying its predictions completely. Very likely, such\na large entropy release would also have had to occur before baryogenesis, in order to avoid an\nunacceptable dilution of the primordially-generated baryon asymmetry. The latest epoch at\nwhich baryogenesis is seems likely to have occurred is the electroweak phase transition, which\noccurred when the age t \u223c 10\u221210 s. Afleck-Dine baryogenesis [40] offers one such possibility.\nIn these models the Universe becomes dominated by the oscillation of a scalar field along\na supersymmetric flat direction. In general, the net baryon asymmetry produced in these\nmodels can be quite large, actually necessitating late entropy production [62]. The dilution\nof the gravitino abundance would be an immediate consequence. The issue of gravitino\nproduction and dilution in connection with baryogenesis was recently considered [63] in the\ncontext of the pre-big bang scenario [64].\nIt is possible that the mass and decay modes of the gravitino are such that the bounds\ndiscussed here, which cover lifetimes from 104 \u2013 1012 s, become inapplicable. We see from\n(55) that the rate for G\u0303 \u2192 \u03c7 + \u03b3 decay would increase by three orders of magnitude if\nMG\u0303 were one order of magnitude larger. In fact, a heavier gravitino might have additional\ndecay modes open kinematically, possibly decreasing its lifetime by another two orders of\nmagnitude if all the MSSM particle weighed less than MG\u0303 . If \u03c4G\u0303 \u223c 104 s, as might occur\nif MG\u0303 \u223c 1 TeV and it could decay into X\u0303EW + XEW as well as \u03c7 + \u03b3, where XEW is\nany Standard Model particle with only electroweak interactions, our limits are significantly\nweakened. However, we remind the reader that outside the range 104 \u2013 1012 s other bounds\ncome into play. At smaller lifetimes, hadronic decay products will upset the prediction of\nBBN [5, 6, 14]. From the recent results of [14], one finds that for lifetimes in the range 1 \u2013\n104 s, the upper limit to YG\u0303 is of order 10\u221213 , and this bound weakens at lower lifetimes. For\n\u03c4 < few \u00d7 10\u22122 s, the BBN limit disappears. Similarly, at longer lifetimes > 1012 s, there\nare non-negligible constraints from the observed gamma-ray background [65, 7, 66]. These\nare strongest for decay lifetimes of order the age of the Universe \u223c 1018 s, where the bound\non mG\u0303 YG\u0303 is of order 10\u221216 . At still longer lifetimes, the bound weaks quickly and becomes\nineffective at lifetimes longer than about 1024 s.\nCould the cosmological embarrassment be avoided if MG\u0303 \u226a 100 GeV? In such a case, the\ngravitino would presumably be the LSP, and absolutely stable if R parity is conserved, as we\nhave been assuming. In fact, as argued in [61], a reheating temperature of order 1010 GeV\nwould result in an acceptably large relic density of gravitinos. Converting the gravitino\nabundance in (58) to its contribution to closure density, one finds,\n\u0012\n\nmG\u0303\n\u03a9G\u0303 h = (0.026 \u2212 0.1) \u00d7\n100 GeV\n2\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\nTR\n10\n10 GeV\n\n\u0013\n\n(61)\n\nIn this case, the lightest MSSM sparticle (presumably the lightest neutralino \u03c7) would be\nthe next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP), and would itself be unstable: the decay\nNLSP \u2192 \u03b3 + G\u0303 would have a lifetime similar to (56), and the bound (57) could be applied\n\n26\n\n\fto the NLSP abundance YN LSP , which in terms of \u03a9\u03c7 h2 is\n\u03a9\u03c7 h2 < 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 .\n\n(62)\n\nHowever, suppressing \u03a9\u03c7 h2 to such a low value seems very difficult. Characteristic values of\n\u03a9\u03c7 h2 in the MSSM are O(0.01\u221210.0) [67], corresponding to Y\u03c7 \u223c 10\u221210 , which is far above the\nbound (57). Indeed, in much of the phenomenologically allowed supersymmetric parameter\nspace, the relic density is too large. Relic neutralino densities as low as (62) would require\nspecial parameter choices for which the neutralino is either primarily a massive Higgsino, in\nwhich case important coannihilation effects might suppress the abundance, or the neutralino\nmass happens to be very close to half the mass of the Heavy Higgs scalar and pseudo scalar,\nso that rapid s-channel annihilation reduces the neutralino density. In the former case, it is\nin fact unlikely that coannihilations are sufficiently strong to satisfy the bound (62), despite\nreducing the relic density to a level well below critical. In the latter case, however, very low\nrelic densities are possible.\nCould the cosmological embarrassment be avoided by altering the composition of the\nLSP into which the gravitino is supposed to decay? The gravitino decay amplitude could be\nsuppressed, and the lifetime estimate (56) correspondingly increased, if the LSP did not have\nphotino component, for example if it were essentially a pure Higgsino. However, in view of\nthe discussion above, in realistic models it seems difficult to suppress the G\u0303 \u2212 \u03c7 \u2212 \u03b3 coupling\nenough to increase the gravitino lifetime sufficiently to relax the bound (57) adequately,\nbearing in mind the bounds applicable for longer lifetimes.\nFinally, we consider briefly the situation if R parity is violated. First we consider Rviolating decays of the lightest MSSM particle, assumed to be the lightest neutralino \u03c7. As\n\u221210\ndiscussed earlier, its abundance is likely to be Y\u03c7 >\n\u223c 10 , which conflicts with our bounds\n4\n5\nunless \u03c4\u03c7 <\n\u223c 10 s . Considering now the decays of the gravitino, assuming it to be heavier\nthan \u03c7, there are two options to consider. The simplest possibility is that it decays in the\nsame way as in the R-conserving case: G\u0303 \u2192 \u03c7 + \u03b3, etc., in which case the previous R4\nconserving gravitino analysis applies, and we again conclude that \u03c4G\u0303 <\n\u223c 10 s. Alternatively,\n4\nthe dominant G\u0303 decays might violate R parity. In this case, the bound \u03c4\u03c7 <\n\u223c 10 s again\napplies, and, as discussed above, the same bound applies to the decays of the lightest MSSM\nsparticle.\n\n7\n\nDiscussion and Conclusions\n\nWe have re-examined in this paper the upper limits on the possible abundance of any unstable massive relic particle that are provided by the success of Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis\ncalculations. A new aspect of this work has been the use of cosmic microwave background\ndata to constrain independently the baryon-to-photon ratio, which was not possible in previous studies of this problem. We have also incorporated in our analysis the an updated suite\nof photonuclear and nuclear cross sections, and calculated both analytically and numerically\n5\n\n2\nNote that the case \u03c4\u03c7 <\n\u223c 10 s requires further consideration, going beyond the scope of this paper.\n\n27\n\n\fthe network of reactions induced by electromagnetic showers that create and destroy the\nlight elements deuterium, 3 He, 4 He, 6 Li and 7 Li.\nIt was pointed out in previous work that considerations of the deuterium abundance alone\nwould allow certain exceptional regions of parameter space with relatively large abundances\nof unstable particles. However, as shown in this paper, considerations of the abundances of\n4\nHe and 6 Li exclude these particular regions.\nWe have illustrated our results by applying them to massive gravitinos. If they weigh\n\u221214\n\u223c 100 GeV, their primordial abundance YG\u0303 should have been <\n\u223c 5 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 (100 GeV/mG\u0303 ),\ncorresponding to a reheating temperature TR < (1.9 \u2212 7.5) \u00d7 107 GeV. This could present a\npotential difficulty for some models of inflation and leptogenesis. We have discussed various\nscenarios for evading this potential embarrassment, for example by varying the gravitino\nmass, or by postulating an alternative scenario for baryogenesis, such as non-thermal leptogenesis or the Affleck-Dine mechanism.\nThis example of the gravitino illustrates the power and importance of the cosmological\nupper limits on the abundances of unstable massive particles. Extensions of this analysis are\nclearly desirable. For example, it would be valuable to combine our analysis of electromagnetic decay cascades with a similar analysis of hadronic showers, a topic that lies beyond the\nscope of this paper.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Wilfried Buchm\u00fcller for helpful communications.
