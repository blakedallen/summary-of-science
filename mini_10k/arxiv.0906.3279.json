Introduction\n1.1. Statement of results. Let D = {z \u2208 C : |z| < 1}, D0 = D \\ {0}, and D0 = {z \u2208 C :\n0 < |z| \u2264 1}.\nDefinition 1.1. We say that \u03a3B is a bordered Riemann surface of type (g, n) if 1) its boundary consists of n ordered closed curves homeomorphic to S 1 and 2) it is biholomorphically\nequivalent to a compact Riemann surface of genus g with n simply-connected non-overlapping\nregions, biholomorphic to D, removed. We say that \u03a3P is a punctured Riemann surface of\ntype (g, n) if it is biholomorphically equivalent to a compact Riemann surface with n points\np1 , . . . , pn removed.\nNote that it is assumed that bordered Riemann surfaces have no punctures, and that\nthe boundary components of punctured Riemann surfaces consist only of single points. We\nwill denote bordered Riemann surfaces of type (g, n) with a superscript B and punctured\nRiemann surfaces with a superscript P .\nRemark 1.2. One can also view a punctured Riemann surface \u03a3P as a compact Riemann\nsurface with n distinguished points.\nRemark 1.3. Throughout the paper, we consider only Riemann surfaces with no non-trivial\nautomorphisms that are homotopic to the identity. That is, we do not consider the special\ncases where 2g \u2212 2 + n \u2264 0.\nGiven a bordered Riemann surface \u03a3B of type (g, n), we can obtain a punctured Riemann\nsurface \u03a3P in the following way. For details see [12, Section 3]. Denote the boundary components by \u2202i \u03a3B . Let \u03c4 = (\u03c41 , . . . , \u03c4n ) where each \u03c4i : \u2202D \u2192 \u2202i \u03a3B is a fixed quasisymmetric\nmapping. For the purposes of this paper, we say that such a \u03c4i is quasisymmetric if \u03c4i extends\nto a quasiconformal map of {z : 1 < |z| < r} into a doubly-connected neighborhood of \u2202i \u03a3B\n[12, Definition 2.12]. We sew on n copies of the punctured unit disc D0 , denoted D0,i , to \u03a3B\nDate: November 23, 2018.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Consider the disjoint union of \u03a3B and D0,1 \u2294 * * * \u2294 D0,n . Identifying boundary\npoints using \u03c4 , the result is a compact surface \u03a3P with n punctures pi corresponding to each\npuncture in D0 . That is, let\n\u03a3P = (\u03a3B \u2294 D0,1 * * * \u2294 D0,n )/ \u223c\nwhere p \u223c q if p \u2208 \u2202i \u03a3B and q \u2208 \u2202Di , and p = \u03c4i (q). By [12, Theorem 3.3] \u03a3P has a unique\ncomplex structure which is compatible with that of both \u03a3B and D0,i for all i. (Note that\nthe punctures of \u03a3P are also ordered.) If \u03a3P is obtained from \u03a3B in this way we will say\nthat \u03a3P is obtained by \"sewing caps on \u03a3B via \u03c4 \" and we write\nn\n\n\u03a3P = \u03a3B #\u03c4 D0 .\nThe parametrizations \u03c4i can be extended to maps \u03c4\u0303i : D0 \u2192 \u03a3P to the caps of \u03a3P by\n(\n\u03c4i (x) for x \u2208 \u2202D\n(1.1)\n\u03c4\u0303i (x) =\nx\nfor x \u2208 D0 .\nThese maps \u03c4\u0303i have quasiconformal extensions to a neighborhood of D0 .\nThe aim of this paper is to show that the infinite-dimensional Teichm\u00fcller space T (\u03a3B )\nof \u03a3B is a holomorphic fiber space over the finite-dimensional Teichm\u00fcller space T (\u03a3P ) of\n\u03a3P . The fibers can be explicitly described as follows.\nDefinition 1.4 (of Oqc (\u03a3P\u2217 )). Let \u03a3P\u2217 be a compact Riemann surface of type (g, n), with\ndistinguished points p1 , . . . , pn . Define Oqc (\u03a3P\u2217 ) to be the set of n-tuples (\u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6n ) where\n\u03c6i : D \u2192 \u03a3P\u2217 are maps with the following properties:\n(1) \u03c6i (0) = pi\n(2) \u03c6i is conformal on D\n(3) \u03c6i has a quasiconformal extension to a neighborhood of D\n(4) \u03c6i (D) \u2229 \u03c6j (D) = \u2205 whenever i 6= j.\nIt is convenient to single out the following case.\nDefinition 1.5. Let Oqc denote the set of holomorphic univalent functions f : D \u2192 C with\nquasiconformal extensions to C satisfying the normalization f (0) = 0.\nIn [13] it was shown that Oqc possesses a natural complex structure related to that of\nthe universal Teichm\u00fcller space, and that Oqc (\u03a3P\u2217 ) is a complex Banach manifold which is\nn\nlocally modeled on Oqc\n= Oqc \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Oqc .\nP\nLet \u03a3 be the punctured Riemann surface obtained from \u03a3B by sewing on caps via \u03c4 ,\nand let \u03a3P\u2217 be a marked Riemann surface representing an element of the Teichm\u00fcller space\nT (\u03a3P ) of \u03a3P . We show that the fiber in T (\u03a3B ) over this element of T (\u03a3P ), modulo the\naction of Dehn twists around curves homotopic to boundary curves, is in a natural one-toone correspondence with Oqc (\u03a3P\u2217 ).\nWe summarize the main results. Precise definitions and careful statements of the theorems\ncan be found in subsequent sections.\nSummary of results\n(1) If \u03a3B is a bordered Riemann surface of type (g, n) (with 2g \u2212 2 + n > 0) then the\nTeichm\u00fcller space T (\u03a3B ) is a complex fiber space over T (\u03a3P ).\n2\n\n\f(2) Let FB ([\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P\u2217 ]) be the fiber over [\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P\u2217 ] \u2208 T (\u03a3P ). Let DB be the subgroup of\nthe mapping class group of \u03a3B corresponding to Dehn twists around curves homotopic\nto boundary curves. Then FB ([\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P\u2217 ])/ DB is biholomorphic to Oqc (\u03a3P\u2217 ). In\nn\nparticular FB ([\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P\u2217 ]) is locally biholomorphic to the function space Oqc\n.\nP\n(3) Schiffer variation coordinates on T (\u03a3 ) together with open subsets of Oqc (\u03a3P\u2217 ) give\nlocal holomorphic coordinates for T (\u03a3B ).\nSome recent results are a key part of the formulation and proofs of these theorems. First\nis the authors' construction in [12] of a complex structure on the \"rigged moduli space\"\nand its explicit relation to the Teichm\u00fcller space T (\u03a3B ). This construction uses ideas from\ntwo-dimensional conformal field theory in an essential way. A further crucial result from\n[12] is that the operation of sewing two Riemann surfaces with a quasisymmetric boundary\nidentification is holomorphic in Teichm\u00fcller space. The complex structure on Oqc (\u03a3P\u2217 ) was\nconstructed in [13].\nA further tool is Gardiner's construction of coordinates on the Teichm\u00fcller space of a\nsurface of finite type using Schiffer variation [2]. We use his method in order to construct\na section of the projection of T (\u03a3B ) onto T (\u03a3P ). In the first author's thesis [11], Schiffer\nvariation was used in an analogous way, although for the different purpose of defining a\ncomplex structure on the analytically rigged Teichm\u00fcller space.\nThe results above are an application of Segal's [14] formulation of conformal field theory\nto Teichm\u00fcller theory.\n2. fiber structure of T (\u03a3B )\n2.1. Teichm\u00fcller spaces. We now define the relevant Teichm\u00fcller spaces, to fix notation.\nLet \u03a3B be a bordered Riemann surface of of type (g, n). Consider the set of triples\nB\nB\n{(\u03a3B , f1 , \u03a3B\n1 )} where \u03a3 is a fixed Riemann surface, \u03a31 is another Riemann surface and f1 :\nB\nB\nB\nB\n\u03a3B \u2192 \u03a3B\n1 is a quasiconformal map (the \"marking\"). We say that (\u03a3 , f1 , \u03a31 ) \u223c (\u03a3 , f2 , \u03a32 )\n\u22121\nB\nB\nif there exists a biholomorphism \u03c3 : \u03a31 \u2192 \u03a32 such that f2 \u25e6 \u03c3 \u25e6 f1 is homotopic to the\nidentity \"rel boundary\", i.e. in such a way that the restriction of f2\u22121 \u25e6 \u03c3 \u25e6 f1 to the boundary\nis the identity throughout the homotopy.\nDefinition 2.1. The Teichm\u00fcller space of \u03a3B is\nT (\u03a3B ) = {(\u03a3B , f1 , \u03a3B\n1 )}/ \u223c .\n\u2217\n\u2217\nWe denote the equivalence classes by [\u03a3B , f1 , \u03a3B\n1 ]. The case T (D ), where D = {z : |z| >\n1} \u222a {\u221e}, is the universal Teichm\u00fcller space.\nIt is well known that T (\u03a3B ) is a complex Banach manifold with complex structure comB\nB\npatible with the space L\u221e\n\u22121,1 (\u03a3 ) of Beltrami differentials \u03bc on \u03a3 in the following sense.\nB\nLet L\u221e\n\u22121,1 (\u03a3 )1 denote the unit ball in the space of Beltrami differentials. Let\nB\nB\n\u03a6 : L\u221e\n\u22121,1 (\u03a3 )1 \u2192 T (\u03a3 )\n\nbe the fundamental projection, given by taking a Beltrami differential \u03bc to [\u03a3B , f \u03bc , \u03a3\u03bc ] where\nf \u03bc is a quasiconformal map of dilatation \u03bc. \u03a6 is well-defined and\nTheorem 2.2 ([7],[10]). \u03a6 is holomorphic and possesses local holomorphic sections.\nSimilarly, we can define the Teichm\u00fcller space of a punctured Riemann surface. Let \u03a3P be\na punctured Riemann surface of type (g, n). Consider the set of triples (\u03a3P , f1 , \u03a3P1 ) where \u03a3P\n3\n\n\fis a fixed punctured Riemann surface, and f1 : \u03a3P \u2192 \u03a3P1 is a quasiconformal map onto the\nRiemann surface \u03a3P1 . We say that (\u03a3P , f1 , \u03a3P1 ) \u223c (\u03a3P , f2 , \u03a3P2 ) if there is a biholomorphism\n\u03c3 : \u03a3P1 \u2192 \u03a3P2 such that f2\u22121 \u25e6 \u03c3 \u25e6 f1 is homotopic to the identity.\nDefinition 2.3. The Teichm\u00fcller space of \u03a3P is defined by\nT (\u03a3P ) = {(\u03a3P , f1 , \u03a3P1 )}/ \u223c .\nWe denote the equivalence classes by [\u03a3P , f1 , \u03a3P1 ]. The Teichm\u00fcller space T (\u03a3P ) is a\ncomplex manifold of dimension 3g \u2212 3 + n.\nRemark 2.4. Observing that quasiconformal and holomorphic maps must extend to the\npunctures, one obtains an alternate description of punctured Riemann surfaces and their\nTeichm\u00fcller spaces. One regards a punctured Riemann surface as a compact surface with\ndistinguished points, and the definition of T (\u03a3P ) is altered to require that the quasiconformal\nmappings take punctures to punctures, and the homotopy is \"rel punctures\", that is it\npreserves the punctures throughout.\nRemark 2.5. Of course, the Teichm\u00fcller spaces of punctured and bordered Riemann surfaces\nare special cases of the general definition of the Teichm\u00fcller space of any Riemann surface\ncovered by the disc.\nAs in [12, section 2.1] we introduce a certain subgroup of the mapping class group. The\npure mapping class group of \u03a3B is the group of homotopy classes of quasiconformal selfmappings of \u03a3B which preserve the ordering of the boundary components. Let PModI(\u03a3B )\nbe the subgroup of the mapping class group consisting of equivalence classes of mappings\nthat are the identity on the boundary \u2202\u03a3B . The group PModI(\u03a3B ) is finitely generated by\nDehn twists.\nDefinition 2.6. Let DB(\u03a3B ) be the subgroup of PModI(\u03a3B ) generated by the equivalence\nclasses of mappings which are Dehn twists around curves that are homotopic to boundary\ncurves. We write DB when the surface is clear from context.\nIf \u03a3B is not an annulus or a disk then DB(\u03a3B ) is isomorphic to Zn and is in the center of\nPModI(\u03a3B ).\nB\nB\nThe mapping class group acts on T (\u03a3B ) by [\u03c1] * [\u03a3B , f, \u03a3B\n1 ] = [\u03a3 , f \u25e6 \u03c1, \u03a31 ].\nProposition 2.7 ([12, Lemmas 5.1 and 5.2]). The group PModI(\u03a3B ), and hence its subgroup\nDB(\u03a3B ), acts properly discontinuously and fixed-point freely by biholomorphisms on T (\u03a3B ).\n2.2. Description of the fibration. In this section we describe the fibers. This requires the\nuse of a \"rigged Teichm\u00fcller space\", a concept motivated by conformal field theory, which\nwe will define in the next paragraph. Details and proofs of the statements in this section\nwere given in [12].\nDefinition 2.8. Let \u03a3P be a type (g, n) punctured Riemann surface. Consider the set of\nquadruples (\u03a3P , f1 , \u03a3P1 , \u03c6) where \u03a3P1 is a Riemann surface, f1 : \u03a3P \u2192 \u03a3P1 is a quasiconformal\nmarking map as in the definition of T (\u03a3P ), and \u03c6 \u2208 Oqc (\u03a3P1 ). Define the equivalence relation\n(\u03a3P , f1 , \u03a3P1 , \u03c61 ) \u223c (\u03a3P , f2 , \u03a3P2 , \u03c62 ) if and only if there exists a biholomorphism \u03c3 : \u03a3P1 \u2192 \u03a3P2\nwhich preserves the punctures and their ordering such that \u03c3 \u25e6 \u03c61 = \u03c62 on \u2202D (and hence\non D ) and f2\u22121 \u25e6 \u03c3 \u25e6 f1 is homotopic to the identity. We then define\nTeP (\u03a3P ) = {(\u03a3P , f1 , \u03a3P , \u03c6)}/ \u223c .\n1\n\n4\n\n\fThe rigged Teichm\u00fcller space TeP (\u03a3P ) possesses a complex structure obtained in the following way. First, we have a bijection\nTeP (\u03a3P ) \u223c\n= T (\u03a3B )/ DB\n\nwhere DB and its action are defined in Section 2.1. By Proposition 2.7, TeP (\u03a3P ) inherits a\ncomplex structure from T (\u03a3B ) and the bijection is in fact a biholomorphism [12, Theorem\n5.7 parts (3) and (4)].\nNext define the map P : T (\u03a3B ) \u2192 TeP (\u03a3P ) from [12, Section 5.4] in the following way\n(note that there, the map is denoted PDB ). Fix a base welding \u03c4 : \u2202Dn \u2192 \u2202\u03a3B and a base\nn\nn\nB\nP\nB\nRiemann surface \u03a3P = \u03a3B #\u03c4 D0 . Given [\u03a3B , h, \u03a3B\n1 ] \u2208 T (\u03a3 ), let \u03a31 = \u03a31 #h\u25e6\u03c4 D0 , and\ndefine h\u0303 : \u03a3P \u2192 \u03a3P1 by\n(\nh on \u03a3B\n(2.1)\nh\u0303 =\nid on Dn0 ,\nn\n\nDefine \u03c4\u0303 : D0 \u2192 \u03a3P by (1.1), and set\n(2.2)\n\nP\nP\nP([\u03a3B , h, \u03a3B\n1 ]) = [\u03a3 , h\u0303, \u03a31 , h\u0303 \u25e6 \u03c4\u0303 ].\n\nThis map satisfies P(p) = P(q) if and only if p is equivalent to q under the action of DB.\nFurthermore P is a holomorphic map which is locally a biholomorphism in the sense that for\nany point in w \u2208 T (\u03a3B ) there's an open set U containing w on which P is a biholomorphism\nonto an open subset of TeP (\u03a3P ).\nRemark 2.9. The biholomorphism between T B (\u03a3B )/DB and TeP (\u03a3P ) is given explicitly by\nG : T B (\u03a3B )/DB \u2192 TeP (\u03a3P )\n\nB\nB\n[\u03a3B , h, \u03a3B\n1 ] 7\u2192 P([\u03a3 , h, \u03a31 ])\n\nThat G is well-defined and a biholomorphism was established in [12]. It is not possible to\nwrite the inverse explicitly, although we can say the following:\nG\u22121 ([\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P\u2217 , \u03c6]) = [\u03a3B , f\u03c6 , \u03a3P\u2217 \\\u03c6(Dn0 )]\nwhere it is understood that the right hand side is a representative of a point in T B (\u03a3B )/DB,\nand f\u03c6 is a quasiconformal map satisfying (1) f\u03c6 is homotopic to f , and (2) h \u25e6 \u03c4 = \u03c6 on\n\u2202D. Details are found in [12, Theorems 5.5 and 5.6].\nRemark 2.10. Similarly, although P has a local holomorphic inverse, one cannot be completely explicit about it. Many of the difficulties in this paper can be traced to this fact.\nHowever, we are able to write the restriction of the inverse to specified holomorphic curves.\nThe local invertibility of P was established with the help of an existence theorem for\nquasiconformal maps, which is ultimately based on the \u03bb-lemma. See [12, Sections 4 and\n5.4].\nNext we define two fiber projections. Firstly, let\n(2.3)\n\nF : TeP (\u03a3P ) \u2192 T (\u03a3P )\n\n[\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P1 , \u03c6] 7\u2192 [\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P1 ].\n5\n\n\fNote that in [12] we call this map FT . Secondly, we have the sewing map\n(2.4)\n\nC : T (\u03a3B ) \u2212\u2192 T (\u03a3P )\nn\n\nn\n\nB\nB\n[\u03a3B , h, \u03a3B\n1 ] 7\u2212\u2192 [\u03a3 #\u03c4 D0 , h\u0303, \u03a31 #h\u25e6\u03c4 D0 ].\n\nIt was proved in [12, Section 6] that F \u25e6 P = C and C is a holomorphic map. Since P is a\nlocal biholomorphism it follows immediately that F is a holomorphic map.\nWe define the fibers by\nFB ([\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P1 ]) = C \u22121 ([\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P1 ]).\nand\nFP ([\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P1 ]) = F \u22121 ([\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P1 ]).\nWe will often denote a particular fiber by FB or FP , if there is no fear of confusion. The\naction of DB preserves each fiber FB since F \u25e6 P = C and thus we can conclude that\nFP = G(FB / DB).\nRemark 2.11. C and F , and hence the fibrations themselves, depend on the choice of \u03c4 .\nFor the convenience of the reader we summarize this section with a theorem.\nTheorem 2.12.\n(1) TeP (\u03a3P ) possesses a complex structure,\n(2) P is holomorphic, and for every point w \u2208 T (\u03a3B ), there is an open neighborhood U\nof w such that P is a biholomorphism onto its open image.\n(3) F \u25e6 P = C.\n(4) F and C are holomorphic and onto.\n2.3. Fibers are complex submanifolds of T (\u03a3B ). In this section we demonstrate that the\nfibers are complex submanifolds of T (\u03a3B ). This requires the construction of local sections.\nThe construction relies on a method of Gardiner [2] (see also Nag [10]), who used Schiffer\nvariation to construct local coordinates on Teichm\u00fcller spaces of punctured Riemann surfaces\nof finite type.\nWe outline some necessary facts about complex submanifolds of Banach spaces. These\ncan be found in for example [10, Section 1.6.2], and also [5] in the differentiable setting.\nLet E1 and E2 be Banach spaces, and Y a complex Banach manifold. Let U1 and U2 be\nopen subsets of E1 and E2 respectively. We say that g : U1 \u00d7 U2 \u2192 Y is a projection, if there\nis a map h : U1 \u2192 Y such that g = h \u25e6 pr1 where pr1 : U1 \u00d7 U2 \u2192 U1 is the projection onto\nthe first component.\nDefinition 2.13. Let X and Y be complex Banach manifolds. f : X \u2192 Y is a holomorphic\nsubmersion if f is holomorphic, for all x \u2208 X there is a chart (U, \u03c6) on X with x \u2208 U and\nopen sets U1 \u2282 E1 and U2 \u2282 E2 of Banach spaces E1 and E2 , such that (1) \u03c6 : U \u2192 U1 \u00d7 U2\nis a biholomorphism and (2) there is a chart (V, \u03c8) with f (x) \u2208 V , such that \u03c8 \u25e6 f \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121 is\na projection.\nA holomorphic fiber space is defined as follows.\nDefinition 2.14. A holomorphic fiber space is a pair of complex Banach manifolds (X, Y )\ntogether with a holomorphic, submersive and surjective map \u03c0 : X \u2192 Y .\n6\n\n\fIt follows immediately from the definition of a submersion that the fibers of a submersion\nare complex submanifolds.\nLemma 2.15. A holomorphic submersion F : X \u2192 Y is an open mapping and the fibers\nF \u22121 (y) are complex submanifolds of X.\nWe will use the following characterization of submersions.\nLemma 2.16. A holomorphic mapping F : X \u2192 Y between Banach spaces is submersive if\nand only if it possesses local holomorphic sections passing through every point x \u2208 X.\nWe now briefly describe Schiffer variation of Riemann surfaces. For details see [2] or [10,\nSection 4.3]. Let \u03a3 be either a punctured Riemann surface of type (g, n) or a bordered\nRiemann surface of type (g, n). Let (V, \u03b6) be a holomorphic chart on \u03a3 such that D \u2282 \u03b6(V ),\nand let U = \u03b6 \u22121 (D) be a parametric disk on \u03a3.\nFor \u01eb in a sufficiently small disk centered at 0 \u2208 C, the map v \u01eb : \u2202D \u2192 C given by\n\u01eb\nv (z) = z + \u01eb/z is a biholomorphism on some neighborhood of \u2202D. Let D \u01eb denote the region\nbounded by v \u01eb (\u2202D). We obtain a new Riemann surface \u03a3\u01eb as follows:\n\u03a3\u01eb = (\u03a3\\U) \u2294 D \u01eb / \u223c\nwhere x \u2208 \u2202U and x\u2032 \u2208 \u2202D \u01eb are equivalent, x \u223c x\u2032 , if x\u2032 = v \u01eb \u25e6 \u03b6(x). The complex structure\non \u03a3\u01eb is compatible with D \u01eb and \u03a3\\U .\nThe quasiconformal map w \u01eb : D \u2192 D \u01eb given by w \u01eb (z) = z + \u01ebz\u0304 has complex dilatation \u01eb.\nLet \u03bd \u01eb : \u03a3 \u2192 \u03a3\u01eb be defined by\n(\nx\nif x \u2208 \u03a3\\U\n\u03bd \u01eb (x) =\n\u01eb\nw \u25e6 \u03b6(x) if x \u2208 U.\nThis map is quasiconformal with dilatation 0 on \u03a3\\U and dilatation \u01ebd\u03b6\u0304/d\u03b6 on U.\nLet \u03a9 be some polydisc centered at 0 \u2208 Cn and \u01eb = (\u01eb1 , . . . , \u01ebn ) \u2208 \u03a9. The above variation\nprocedure can be applied to n non-overlapping parametric disks U1 , . . . , Un to obtain a\nRiemann surface \u03a3\u01eb and a quasiconformal map \u03bd \u01eb : \u03a3 \u2192 \u03a3\u01eb . We thus have a map\nS : \u03a9 \u2192 T (\u03a3)\n\u01eb 7\u2192 [\u03a3, \u03bd \u01eb , \u03a3\u01eb ].\nThe key result of [2] and [10, Theorem 4.3.2] is the following:\nTheorem 2.17.\n(1) The map S is holomorphic for any type of Riemann surface \u03a3.\n(2) Let \u03a3P be a punctured surface of type (g, n), and let d = 3g \u22123+n. For an essentially\narbitrary choice of parametric disks U1 , . . . , Un , the parameters (\u01eb1 , . . . , \u01ebd ) provide\nlocal holomorphic coordinates for T (\u03a3P ) in a neighborhood of [\u03a3, id, \u03a3]. That is, S is\na biholomorphism onto its image.\nThe first result follows directly from the fact that dilatation of \u03bd \u01eb is holomorphic in \u01eb. For\nthe second result, it is non-trivial to prove that the variations give independent directions in\nT (\u03a3P ).\nGetting coordinates at an arbitrary point [\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P1 ] in Teichm\u00fcller space follows by applying a change of base surface biholomorphism from T (\u03a3P ) to T (\u03a3P1 ) in the following way.\n7\n\n\fFirst we apply Schiffer variation to \u03a3P1 . This gives a neighborhood of the base point in\nT (\u03a3P1 ). Let f\u2217 : T (\u03a3P1 ) \u2192 T (\u03a3P ) be the change of base surface biholomorphism corresponding to f . That is, f\u2217 ([\u03a3P1 , \u03bd \u01eb , \u03a3P1 ]) = [\u03a3P , \u03bd \u01eb \u25e6 f, \u03a3P1 ]. Thus, the image under f\u2217 of the Schiffer\nneighborhood in T (\u03a3P1 ) is the Schiffer neighborhood of [\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P1 ] \u2208 T (\u03a3P ).\nWe can now show that\nTheorem 2.18. The map C (2.4) possess local holomorphic sections through every point.\nProof. Let [\u03a3B , f, \u03a3B ] be an arbitrary point in T (\u03a3B ) and let [\u03a3P , f \u0303, \u03a3P ] = C[\u03a3B , f, \u03a3B ]\n1\n\nn\n\n1\n\n1\n\nwhere C is the sewing map defined in (2.4). Recall that \u03a3P1 = \u03a3B\n1 #f \u25e6\u03c4 D0 . Let d = 3g + 3 \u2212 n.\nBy Theorem 2.17, we can choose d disjoint disks on \u03a3B\nsuch\nthat\nperforming Schiffer variation\n1\nP\non \u03a31 using these disks results in a biholomorphic map\nS : \u03a9 \u2212\u2192 S(\u03a9) \u2282 T (\u03a3P )\n\u01eb 7\u2212\u2192 [\u03a3P , (f \u0303)\u01eb , \u03a3P,\u01eb ],\n1\n\nwhere (f \u0303)\u01eb = \u03bd \u01eb \u25e6 f \u0303, \u01eb = (\u01eb1 , . . . , \u01ebd ), and \u03a9 is an open neighborhood of 0 \u2208 Cd .\nPerforming the Schiffer variation on \u03a3B\n1 using the same disks produces a holomorphic map\nS B : \u03a9 \u2212\u2192 T (\u03a3B )\n\u01eb 7\u2212\u2192 [\u03a3B , f \u01eb , \u03a3B,\u01eb\n1 ],\nwhere f \u01eb = \u03bd \u01eb \u25e6 f .\nBy Theorem 2.17, \u03b7 = S B \u25e6 S \u22121 : S(\u03a9) \u2192 T (\u03a3B ) is holomorphic. To show that it is a\nsection of C through [\u03a3B , f, \u03a3B\n1 ], it remains to show that C \u25e6 \u03b7 is the identity.\n\u01eb\nNote that f = f on \u2202\u03a3, and by definition of f \u0303, (f \u0303)\u01eb = fe\u01eb . Because the disks on which to\nperform Schiffer variation were chosen to be away from the caps of \u03a3P1 ,\nn\n\nP,\u01eb\n\u03a3B,\u01eb\n1 #f \u01eb \u25e6\u03c4 D0 = \u03a31 .\n\nSo we have\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\nn\nB,\u01eb\nP\nB\n\u01eb\n \u0303 \u01eb P,\u01eb\n(C \u25e6 \u03b7) [\u03a3P , (f \u0303)\u01eb , \u03a3P,\u01eb\n]\n=\nC\n[\u03a3\n,\nf\n,\n\u03a3\n]\n= [\u03a3P , fe\u01eb , \u03a3B,\u01eb\n1\n1\n1 #f \u01eb \u25e6\u03c4 D0 ] = [\u03a3 , (f ) , \u03a31 ]\nand thus C \u25e6 \u03b7 is the identity.\n\n\u0003\n\nWe now have the following key results.\nCorollary 2.19. The Teichm\u00fcller space T (\u03a3B ) is a holomorphic fiber space over T (\u03a3P )\nwith fiber structure given by the sewing map\nC : T (\u03a3B ) 7\u2212\u2192 T (\u03a3P ).\nProof. Theorem 2.12 states that C is holomorphic and onto. Lemma 2.16 and Theorem 2.18\nshow that C is a submersion.\n\u0003\nFrom Lemma 2.15 we obtain:\nCorollary 2.20. The fibers FB are complex submanifolds of T (\u03a3B ).\nCorollary 2.21. The fibers FP are complex submanifolds of TeP (\u03a3P ).\n\nProof. From Theorem 2.12 F is holomorphic. It possesses local holomorphic sections, since\nif \u03c1 : T (\u03a3P ) \u2192 T (\u03a3B ) is a local holomorphic section of C, then P \u25e6 \u03c1 is a local holomorphic\nsection of F .\n\u0003\n8\n\n\f3. Local model of fibers\n3.1. Complex structure on Oqc (\u03a3P1 ). The authors defined a complex structure on Oqc (\u03a3P1 )\nin [13], with the help of a model of the universal Teichm\u00fcller curve due to Teo [15]. We outline\nthe definition of the complex structure in this section.\nn\nThe complex structure Oqc (\u03a3P1 ) is locally biholomorphic to Oqc\n= Oqc \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Oqc . So we\nmust first describe the complex structure on Oqc . To do this, we define an injection of Oqc\nonto an open subset of a Banach space. Consider the Banach space\nA1\u221e (D) = {v(z) : D \u2192 C | v holomorphic, ||v||1,\u221e = sup(1 \u2212 |z|2 )|v(z)| < \u221e}.\nz\u2208D\n\nFor f \u2208 Oqc define\nf \u2032\u2032 (z)\nA(f ) = \u2032 .\nf (z)\nWe then have a natural one-to-one map\n(3.1)\n\n\u03c7 : Oqc \u2192 A1\u221e (D) \u2295 C\nf 7\u2192 (A(f ), f \u2032(0)) ,\n\nwhere A1\u221e (D) \u2295 C is a Banach space with the direct sum norm\n||(\u03c6, c)|| = ||\u03c6||1,\u221e + |c|.\nIt was shown in [13] that the image of Oqc is open and thus Oqc inherits a complex structure\nfrom A1\u221e (D) \u2295 C.\nn\nWe now describe the complex structure on Oqc (\u03a3P1 ) in terms of local charts into Oqc\n. Fix\nP\nP\na point (\u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6n ) \u2208 Oqc (\u03a31 ). For i = 1, . . . , n, let Di = \u03c6i (D) be open sets in \u03a31 . Choose\ndomains Bi \u2282 \u03a3P1 with the following properties: 1) \u03c6i (D) \u2282 Bi , 2) Bi \u2229 Bj = \u2205 for i 6= j and\n3) Bi are open and simply connected. Let \u03b6i : Bi \u2192 C be a local biholomorphic parameter\nsuch that \u03b6i (pi ) = 0. We then have that \u03b6i \u25e6 \u03c6i \u2208 Oqc .\nLet Ki be a compact set, which is the closure of an open set containing \u03b6i \u25e6 \u03c6i (D), such\nthat \u03b6i\u22121 (Ki ) \u2282 Bi . By [13, Corollary 3.5], for each i there is an open neighborhood Ui of\n\u03b6i \u25e6 \u03c6i in Oqc such that \u03c8i (D) \u2282 Ki for all \u03c8i \u2208 Ui , and so (\u03b61\u22121 \u25e6 \u03c81 , . . . , \u03b6n\u22121 \u25e6 \u03c8n ) is an\nelement of Oqc (\u03a3P1 ).\nThus, U1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Un is an open subset of Oqc \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Oqc with the product topology. Let\nVi = { \u03b6i\u22121 \u25e6 \u03c8i | \u03c8i \u2208 Ui };\nthen sets of the form V = V1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Vn form a base of the topology of Oqc (\u03a3P1 ). Let\nTi : Vi \u2192 Oqc\ng 7\u2192 \u03b6i \u25e6 g.\nand note that Ti (Vi ) = Ui . The local coordinates\nT = (T1 , . . . , Tn ) : V \u2192 U\ndefine a complex Banach manifold structure on Oqc (\u03a3P1 ).\nRemark 3.1. In fact, fixing Bi and \u03b6i , i = 1, . . . , n, T is a valid chart on the set of all elements\nof Oqc (\u03a3P1 ) which map all n copies of the disk into the corresponding set Bi .\n9\n\n\fLet Ui = {\u03c8i \u2208 Oqc | \u03c8i (D) \u2282 \u03b6i (Bi )} and observe that U = U1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Un is open by\n[13, Corollary 3.5]. Furthermore, the set V = {\u03c6 \u2208 Oqc (\u03a3P1 ) | \u03c6i (D) \u2282 Bi } is open since\nevery point is contained in an open set of the form described above. The map T is clearly a\nbiholomorphism on all of V . Hence, (T, V ) is a local coordinate.\n3.2. The biholomorphism L : Oqc (\u03a3P\u2217 ) \u2192 FP ([\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P\u2217 ]). Fix a point [\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P\u2217 ] \u2208\nT (\u03a3P ) and recall from Section 2.2 that FP ([\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P\u2217 ]) \u2282 TeP (\u03a3P ) is the fiber over this\npoint. Define the map\nL : Oqc (\u03a3P\u2217 ) \u2192 FP ([\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P\u2217 ])\n\u03c6 7\u2192 [\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P\u2217 , \u03c6].\nOur goal is to prove\nTheorem 3.2. The map L : Oqc (\u03a3P\u2217 ) \u2192 FP ([\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P\u2217 ]) is a biholomorphism.\nProof. We will prove this in three stages: first, we show that L is a bijection onto FP (Lemma\n3.9 ahead), second that L is holomorphic (Lemma 3.11 ahead). Lastly, we show that the\ninverse is holomorphic.\nTo show that the inverse is holomorphic, in Section 3.4 we will construct near any point\nin T (\u03a3B ) a local inverse \u039b to the lift P \u22121 \u25e6 L where P \u22121 is a local inverse of P. By Theorem\n2.12 it is enough to show that \u039b is holomorphic, which we will establish in Theorem 3.23\nahead.\n\u0003\nTheorem 3.2 has the following consequences.\nCorollary 3.3. Fix any [\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P\u2217 ] \u2208 T (\u03a3P ). The map\nOqc (\u03a3P\u2217 ) \u2192 FB ([\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P\u2217 ])/ DB\n\u03c6 7\u2192 [\u03a3B , f\u03c6 , \u03a3P\u2217 \\ \u03c6(Dn0 )]\nis a biholomorphism, where f\u03c6 is the restriction of a map f\u03c6\u2032 : \u03a3P \u2192 \u03a3P1 which is homotopic\nto f and satisfies f\u03c6\u2032 \u25e6 \u03c4\u0303 = \u03c6.\nProof. This follows from Theorem 3.2 and Remark 2.9.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 3.4. The fibers FB ([\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P1 ]) and FP ([\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P1 ]) are locally biholomorphic to\nn\nOqc\nfor any [\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P1 ] via the maps T \u25e6 L\u22121 \u25e6 P and T \u25e6 L\u22121 respectively.\nIn the next few sections we require some facts regarding infinite-dimensional holomorphy\n(see for example [1], [7, V.5.1] or [10, Section 1.6]). Let E and F be Banach spaces and let\nU be an open subset of E.\nDefinition 3.5. A map f : U \u2192 F is holomorphic if for each x0 \u2208 U there is a continuous\ncomplex linear map Df (x0 ) : E \u2192 F such that\n||f (x0 + h) \u2212 f (x0 ) \u2212 Df (x0 )(h)||F\n= 0.\nh\u21920\n||h||E\nlim\n\nDefinition 3.6. A map f : U \u2192 F is called G\u00e2teaux holomorphic if f is holomorphic on\ncomplex lines. That is, if for all a \u2208 U and all x \u2208 E, the map z 7\u2192 f (a + zx) is holomorphic\non {z \u2208 C | a + zx \u2208 U}.\n10\n\n\fTheorem 3.7 ([1, p 198]). Let f : U \u2192 F . The following are equivalent.\n(1) f is holomorphic.\n(2) f is G\u00e2teaux-holomorphic and continuous.\n(3) f is G\u00e2teaux-holomorphic and locally bounded on U.\nA subset H of the (continuous) dual space F \u2032 is called separating if for all non-zero x \u2208 F\nthere exists \u03b1 \u2208 H such that \u03b1(x) 6= 0. The following theorem gives another characterization\nof holomorphicity. See [3] for a statement in a more general setting.\nTheorem 3.8. Let f : \u03a9 \u2192 F be a function on a domain \u03a9 in C. If\n(1) \u03b1 \u25e6 f is holomorphic for each continuous linear functional \u03b1 from a separating subset\nof the dual space F \u2032 , and\n(2) f is locally bounded,\nthen f is holomorphic.\nWe now turn to first step in the proof of Theorem 3.2.\nLemma 3.9. L is a bijection between Oqc (\u03a3P\u2217 ) and FP ([\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P\u2217 ]).\nProof. By the definitions of TeP (\u03a3P ) and T (\u03a3P ), every element in FP has a representative of\nthe form [\u03a3P , f \u0303, \u03a3P\u2217 , \u03c6]. L is thus clearly a surjection.\nAssume that L(\u03c6) = L(\u03c8). If F ([\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P\u2217 , \u03c6]) = F ([\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P\u2217 , \u03c8]), then there exists a\nbiholomorphism \u03c3 : \u03a3P\u2217 \u2192 \u03a3P\u2217 that is homotopic to the identity. Since 2g \u2212 2 + n > 0 there\nare no non-trivial automorphisms which are homotopic to the identity. Thus \u03c3 is the identity\nand so \u03c6 = \u03c8.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.10. The bijection is not canonical since Oqc (\u03a3P\u2217 ) depends on the choice of representative in the Teichm\u00fcller equivalence class. However, if [\u03a3P , f1 , \u03a3P1 ] = [\u03a3P , f2 , \u03a3P2 ] and\n\u03c3 : \u03a3P1 \u2192 \u03a3P2 is the biholomorphism realizing the equivalence, then we have the bijection\n\u03c3 \u2217 : Oqc (\u03a3P1 ) \u2192 Oqc (\u03a3P2 ) defined by \u03c3 \u2217 (\u03c61 ) = \u03c3 \u25e6 \u03c61 , and L1 = L2 \u25e6 \u03c3 \u2217 . It will follow from\nTheorem 3.2 (once the proof is complete) that Oqc (\u03a3P1 ) and Oqc (\u03a3P2 ) are biholomorphic\nunder \u03c3 \u2217 .\n3.3. L is holomorphic.\nLemma 3.11. L is holomorphic.\nProof. Fix \u03c60 \u2208 Oqc (\u03a3P\u2217 ). We will show that L is holomorphic in a neighborhood of \u03c60 by\nB\nfirst proving that L is G\u00e2teaux holomorphic and then that the lift of L to L\u221e\n\u22121,1 (\u03a3 )1 is\nlocally bounded.\nTo simplify notation we assume that \u03a3P has only one puncture, p1 . The proof of the\ngeneral case is identical with the exception of the notation. Let (T, V ) be a chart on Oqc (\u03a3P\u2217 )\ncontaining \u03c60 and let B = B1 , D = D1 and \u03b6 = \u03b61 be as in Section 3.1. Recall that the map\n\u03c7 (3.1) defines the complex structure on Oqc .\nTo show L is G\u00e2teaux holomorphic we must show that\nL \u25e6 T \u22121 \u25e6 \u03c7\u22121 : A1 (D) \u2295 C \u2192 TeP (\u03a3P )\n\u221e\n\nis G\u00e2teaux holomorphic. Since the holomorphic structure on TeP (\u03a3P ) is obtained from T (\u03a3B )\nwe proceed by producing a lift of L \u25e6 T \u22121 \u25e6 \u03c7\u22121 to T (\u03a3B ).\n11\n\n\f\u221e\nLet \u03c80 = T (\u03c60 ) = \u03b6 \u25e6\u03c60 \u2208 Oqc , u0 = A(\u03c80 ) \u2208 A\u221e\n1 , and choose an element (v, c) \u2208 A1 (D)\u2295\nC. Let N be an open neighborhood of 0 \u2208 C, and consider the map N \u2192 \u03c7(T (V )) \u2282 A\u221e\n1 \u2295C\n\u2032\ngiven by t 7\u2192 (u0 + tv, qt ) where qt = \u03c80 (0) + tc. That is, we have an complex line through\n\u03c7(\u03c80 ) = (u0 , \u03c80\u2032 (0)).\nLet\n\u03c8t = \u03c7\u22121 (u0 + tv, qt ).\n\nFrom the definition (3.1) of \u03c7 we have a differential equation for \u03c8t , whose solution is\n\u0012 Z \u03be\n\u0013\nZ z\nqt\n\u2032\n\u03c8 (\u03be) exp t\ng(w)dw d\u03be.\n(3.2)\n\u03c8t (z) = \u2032\n\u03c80 (0) 0 0\n0\n\nIt is clear from this expression that \u03c8t (z) is holomorphic in t for fixed z \u2208 D.\nNow, \u03c8t \u25e6 \u03c80\u22121 is a holomorphic motion of \u03c80 (D). By the extended lambda-lemma [17] it\nextends to a holomorphic motion of C, and in particular the continuous extension of \u03c8t \u25e6 \u03c80\u22121\nto \u03c80 (D) is a holomorphic motion. Thus \u03c8t \u25e6 \u03c80\u22121 restricted to \u03c80 (\u2202D) is a holomorphic\nmotion.\nLet \u03c6t = T \u22121 (\u03c8t ) = \u03b6 \u22121 \u25e6 \u03c8t , and let At = B \\ \u03c6t (D) be the annular region on \u03a3P\u2217\nbounded by \u2202B and \u03c6t (\u2202D). Applying [12, Lemma 7.1] we obtain a holomorphic motion\nHt : \u03b6(A0 ) \u2192 \u03b6(At ) such that Ht |\u03b6(\u2202B) is the identity and Ht |\u03c80 (\u2202D) = \u03c8t \u25e6 \u03c80\u22121 .\nP\nB\nB\nLet \u03a3B\n\u2217,t = \u03a3\u2217 \\ \u03c6t (D). By [12, Proposition 7.1] the map Ft : \u03a3\u2217,0 \u2192 \u03a3\u2217,t defined by\n(\nid\non \u03a3B\n\u2217 \\ A0\n(3.3)\nFt =\n\u22121\n\u03b6 \u25e6 Ht \u25e6 \u03b6 on A0 .\nis quasiconformal and holomorphic in t for fixed z. On \u03c60 (\u2202D), Ft = \u03b6 \u22121 \u25e6\u03c8t \u25e6\u03c80\u22121 \u25e6\u03b6 = \u03c6t \u25e6\u03c6\u22121\n0 .\n\u221e\nB\nFrom [12, Proposition 7.2], t 7\u2192 \u03bc(Ft ) is a holomorphic function N \u2192 L\u22121,1 (\u03a3\u2217,0 )1 . Therefore,\nB\nby the holomorphicity of the fundamental projection, t 7\u2192 [\u03a3B\n\u2217,0 , Ft , \u03a3\u2217,t ] is holomorphic.\n\u22121\nLet [\u03a3B , h0 , \u03a3B\n([\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P\u2217 , \u03c60]) where P \u22121 is a local inverse of P and h\u03030 \u25e6 \u03c4\u0303 = \u03c60\n\u2217,0 ] = P\nfrom the definition of P in (2.2). For g : \u03a3B \u2192 \u03a3B\n\u2217,0 , let\nB\ng\u2217 : T (\u03a3B\n\u2217,0 ) \u2192 T (\u03a3 )\nB\nB\nB\n[\u03a3B\n\u2217,0 , h1 , \u03a31 ] 7\u2192 [\u03a3 , h1 \u25e6 g, \u03a31 ].\n\nbe the change of base point biholomorphism (see [10, Sections 2.3.1 and 3.2.5]). In particular,\nB\nB\nB\nB\ng\u2217 ([\u03a3B\n\u2217,0 , Ft , \u03a3\u2217,t ]) = [\u03a3 , Ft \u25e6g, \u03a3\u2217,t ] is a biholomorphism, and therefore the map t 7\u2192 [\u03a3 , Ft \u25e6\nB\nB\nh0 , \u03a3\u2217,t ] from N into T (\u03a3 ) is holomorphic. Moreover, t 7\u2192 \u03bc(Ft \u25e6 h0 ) is also holomorphic.\nFrom the boundary values of Ft and h0 we see that Ft \u25e6 h0 \u25e6 \u03c4 = \u03c6t on \u2202D. Furthermore,\nextending Ft , h0 and \u03c4 by the identity to the caps as in equation (2.1), we have that F\u0303t \u25e6 h\u03030 \u25e6 \u03c4\u0303\nP\nis homotopic to f (after identifying \u03a3B\n\u2217,t #D0 with \u03a3\u2217 ). Thus\nP\nB\nP\nP\nP([\u03a3B , Ft \u25e6 h0 , \u03a3B\n\u2217,t ]) = [\u03a3 , F\u0303t \u25e6 h\u03030 , \u03a3\u2217,t #\u03c6t D0 , \u03c6t ] = [\u03a3 , f, \u03a3\u2217 , \u03c6t ]\n\nand so\nN \u2192 Te(\u03a3P )\n\nt 7\u2192 (L \u25e6 T \u22121 \u25e6 \u03c7\u22121 )(h0 + tg, qt ) = [\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P\u2217 , \u03c6t ]\n\nis holomorphic. That is, L \u25e6 T \u22121 \u25e6 \u03c7\u22121 is G\u00e2teaux holomorphic.\n12\n\n\fB\nB\nWe have that 1) the fundamental projection \u03a6 : L\u221e\n\u22121,1 (\u03a3 )1 \u2192 T (\u03a3 ) is holomorphic and possesses local holomorphic sections and 2) P : T (\u03a3B ) \u2192 TeP (\u03a3P ) is holomorphic and possesses local holomorphic sections. Thus there is an open neighborhood M of\nB\n[\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P\u2217 , \u03c60 ] \u2208 TeP (\u03a3P ) and a local holomorphic section \u03c3 : M \u2192 L\u221e\n\u22121,1 (\u03a3 ) of P \u25e6 \u03a6. Continuity in t guarantees that for |t| sufficiently small, [\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P\u2217 , \u03c6t ] \u2282 M. The function \u03c3 \u25e6 L\nis G\u00e2teaux holomorphic and locally bounded since \u03c3 maps into the open unit ball. Thus, by\nTheorem 3.7, \u03c3 \u25e6 L is holomorphic, and therefore L = P \u25e6 \u03a6 \u25e6 \u03c3 \u25e6 L is holomorphic.\n\u0003\n\nRemark 3.12. For any fixed z \u2208 D, the point evaluation map Oqc \u2192 C given by f 7\u2192 f (z) is\nholomorphic. The proof is an immediate consequence of Theorem 3.7 noting that G\u00e2teaux\nholomorphy follows from equation (3.2), and continuity is proved in [13, Corollary 3.4.]. This\nresult is also included in the proof of [13, Lemma 3.10] but it is not mentioned explicitly.\n3.4. The local inverse of L. In order to show that L\u22121 is biholomorphic, we show that\nP \u22121 \u25e6 L : Oqc (\u03a3P\u2217 ) \u2192 T (\u03a3B ) has a local holomorphic inverse for any local inverse P \u22121 of P.\nThe description of the inverse to P \u22121 \u25e6 L is somewhat lengthy and deserves its own section.\nIn fact we are only able to explicitly describe the inverse on specified holomorphic curves.\nThe source of the trouble can be partly traced to the fact that local inverses of P cannot be\nexplicitly defined (see Remark 2.10).\nn\nIt is necessary to make the following change of base point. Recall that \u03a3P = \u03a3B #\u03c4 D0 as\nin Section 2.2, which we now think of as a punctured surface. Let U be the upper half-plane,\nand choose a Fuchsian group G such that \u03a3G = U/G is an n-punctured surface biholomorphic\nto \u03a3P . Let\n\u03b1 : \u03a3P \u2192 \u03a3G\nbe a fixed biholomorphism.\nLet A be an open set of T (\u03a3B ) such that P|A is a biholomorphism. Let\nAB = FB \u2229 A,\n\n(3.4)\n\nwhere FB is the fiber in T (\u03a3B ) above the fixed point [\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P\u2217 ] (see Section 2.2).\nn\nB\nB\nP\nB\nGiven [\u03a3B , h, \u03a3B\n1 ] \u2208 AB we have that P([\u03a3 , h, \u03a31 ]) = ([\u03a3 , h\u0303, \u03a31 #h\u25e6\u03c4 D0 ]). The change\nof base point biholomorphism (\u03b1\u2217 )\u22121 : T (\u03a3P ) \u2192 T (\u03a3G ) is defined by\nn\n\nn\n\n\u22121\nB\n(\u03b1\u2217 )\u22121 ([\u03a3P , h\u0303, \u03a3B\n1 #h\u25e6\u03c4 D0 ]) = [\u03a3G , h\u0303 \u25e6 \u03b1 , \u03a31 #h\u25e6\u03c4 D0 ].\n\nNow define the Beltrami differential\n\n(\n\u03bc(h \u25e6 \u03b1\u22121 ) on \u03b1(\u03a3B ) \u2282 \u03a3G\n\u03bc = \u03bc(h\u0303 \u25e6 \u03b1\u22121 ) =\n0\non \u03b1(D).\n\n\u221e\nin L\u221e\n\u22121,1 (\u03a3G )1 .

By definition of the fiber FB , [\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P\u2217 ] = [\u03a3P , h\u0303, \u03a3B\n1 #h\u25e6\u03c4 D0 ], and applying (\u03b1 )\nleads to\n\n[\u03a3G , f \u25e6 \u03b1\u22121 , \u03a3P\u2217 ] = [\u03a3G , h\u0303 \u25e6 \u03b1\u22121 , \u03a3B\n1 #h\u25e6\u03c4 D0 ]\nTherefore \u03bc = \u03bc(h\u0303\u25e6\u03b1\u22121 ) is equivalent to the fixed element \u03bc(f \u25e6\u03b1\u22121 ). The result now follows\nfrom Lemma 3.13.\n\u0003\nWe may therefore let \u03c3 : \u03a3\u03bc \u2192 \u03a3P\u2217 be a fixed biholomorphism, and define\n(3.5)\n\n\u039b : AB \u2192 Oqc (\u03a3P\u2217 )\n\u03bc\n[\u03a3B , h, \u03a3B\n1 ] 7\u2192 \u03c3 \u25e6 f \u25e6 \u03b1 \u25e6 \u03c4\u0303\n\nwhere \u03bc = \u03bc(h\u0303 \u25e6 \u03b1\u22121 ) and f \u03bc is the unique quotient map\nf \u03bc : \u03a3G \u2192 \u03a3\u03bc .\ncorresponding to w \u03bc .\nB\nB\nRemark 3.15.

This follows from the fact that \u03bc(h) 7\u2192 \u03bc(h\u0303) is holomorphic (see [12, Lemma\n6.2]), and the map \u03bc(h\u0303) 7\u2192 \u03bc(h\u0303 \u25e6 \u03b1\u22121 ) is holomorphic by the change of base point holomorphicity (see [10, Sections 2.3.1 and 3.2.5]).\nB\nB\nB\nProposition 3.17. If (\u03a3B , h1 , \u03a3B\n1 ) is equivalent to (\u03a3 , h2 , \u03a32 ) in AB \u2282 T (\u03a3 ), then the\ncorresponding maps f \u03bc1 and f \u03bc2 are equal on \u03b1(\u2202\u03a3B ). In particular, \u039b is well-defined.\nB\nB\nB\nB\nProof. Let [\u03a3B , h1 , \u03a3B\n1 ] = [\u03a3 , h2 , \u03a32 ], so that there exists a biholomorphism \u03b3 : \u03a31 \u2192 \u03a32\nB\nsuch that h\u22121\n2 \u25e6 \u03b3 \u25e6 h1 is homotopic to the identity rel \u2202\u03a3 . Since the dilatation of \u03b3 \u25e6 h1\nand h1 are equal, composition by \u03b3 does not change the resulting f \u03bc in the definition of \u039b.\n\u22121\nB\nThus we may absorb \u03b3 into h1 and assume that \u03a3B\n1 = \u03a32 and h2 \u25e6 h1 is homotopic to the\nidentity rel \u2202\u03a3B . In particular, h1 = h2 on \u2202\u03a3B and moreover h\u03031 is homotopic to h\u03032 on \u03a3P .\nNow let \u03c3 : \u03a3\u03bc \u2192 \u03a3P\u2217 be the fixed biholomorphism in the definition of \u039b. Let f \u03bci : \u03a3G \u2192\n\u03a3\u03bc be the pair of maps with dilatations \u03bci = \u03bc(h\u0303i \u25e6 \u03b1\u22121 ) respectively.\nSince h\u0303i \u25e6\u03b1\u22121 and f \u03bci have the same dilatations for i = 1, 2, there is a pair of biholomorphic\nn\n\u03bc\nmaps \u03b4i : \u03a3B\ni #hi \u25e6\u03c4 D0 \u2192 \u03a3 such that\n\n(3.6)\n\n\u03b4i \u25e6 h\u0303i \u25e6 \u03b1\u22121 = f \u03bci\n14\n\n\fn\n\nn\n\nB\nB\nB\non \u03a3G . Because h1 = h2 on \u2202\u03a3B and \u03a3B\n1 = \u03a32 , \u03a31 #h1 \u25e6\u03c4 D0 = \u03a32 #h2 \u25e6\u03c4 D0 .\nBy Remark 3.15, we know that (f \u03bc2 )\u22121 \u25e6 f \u03bc1 is homotopic to the identity on \u03a3G . Thus\n\u22121\n\u03b42 \u25e6 \u03b41 is homotopic to the identity. Since \u03a3P is of type (g, n) with 2g \u2212 2 + n > 0 the\nbiholomorphism \u03b42\u22121 \u25e6 \u03b41 must be the identity. We can conclude that \u03b41 = \u03b42 . Therefore,\nsince h1 = h2 on \u2202\u03a3B , by (3.6) f \u03bc1 = f \u03bc2 on \u03b1(\u2202\u03a3B ), so\nB\nB\n\u039b([\u03a3B , h1 , \u03a3B\n1 ]) = \u039b([\u03a3 , h2 , \u03a32 ]).\n\n\u0003\nLet P \u22121 denote a locally defined inverse of P (see (2.2)) in a neighborhood of [\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P\u2217 , \u03c60 ].\nWe need to show that\n\u039b \u25e6 P \u22121 \u25e6 L = id\non some neighborhood of \u03c60 .

Since t 7\u2192 \u03bc(ht ) is holomorphic in t, Remark 3.16 shows that \u03bct = \u03bc(h\u0303t \u25e6 \u03b1\u22121 ) is\nholomorphic in t. Thus for fixed z, w \u03bct (z) is holomorphic in t. Because \u03c0 \u03bc is independent\nof \u03bc by Lemma 3.13 and Proposition 3.14, f \u03bct (z) is also holomorphic in t for fixed z.\nFor z \u2208 D,\n\u03bct\n\u03b4t (z) = (f \u03bct \u25e6 \u03b1 \u25e6 h\u0303\u22121\n\u25e6 \u03b1)(z)\nt )(z) = (f\nfrom the definition of \u03b4t , and the conclusion follows immediately.\n\u0003\nLemma 3.19. \u03c3 = \u03b90 \u25e6 \u03b40\u22121 = \u03b9t \u25e6 \u03b4t\u22121\nProof.

First we claim that \u03b2t is holomorphic in t for z \u2208 E.\nWe have that \u03c6t (z) is holomorphic as a function of t and z and thus so is \u03c6\u22121\nt (z) by a direct\napplication of the implicit function theorem. For z \u2208 E, and using \u03b9t \u25e6 h\u0303t \u25e6 \u03c4\u0303 = \u03c6t from (3.8),\n\u22121\n\u03b2t (z) = (\u03c3 \u25e6 f \u03bct \u25e6 \u03b1 \u25e6 h\u0303\u22121\nt \u25e6 \u03b9t )(z)\n\n= (\u03c3 \u25e6 f \u03bct \u25e6 \u03b1 \u25e6 \u03c4\u0303 \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121\nt )(z)\nwhich is holomorphic in t.\nThe fact that \u03b2t is the identity follows from the following four observations. (1) By\nHurwitz's theorem, the automorphism group of \u03a3P\u2217 is finite. (2) \u03b2t is the identity if and only\nif \u03b2t |E is the identity. (3) For z \u2208 E, \u03b2t (z) is continuous in t. (4) From the definition of \u03c3,\n\u03b20 is the identity.\n\u0003\nTheorem 3.20.

We join \u03c6 to \u03c60 by a holomorphic curve \u03c6t such that \u03c61 = \u03c6. From Lemma 3.19 and\nequation (3.6) we have:\n(\u039b \u25e6 P \u22121 \u25e6 L)(\u03c6t ) = \u039b([\u03a3B , ht , \u03a3B\n\u2217,0 ])\n\u03bct\n= \u03c3 \u25e6 f \u25e6 \u03b1 \u25e6 \u03c4\u0303\n= (\u03b9t \u25e6 \u03b4t\u22121 ) \u25e6 (\u03b4t \u25e6 h\u0303t \u25e6 \u03b1\u22121 ) \u25e6 \u03b1 \u25e6 \u03c4\u0303\n= \u03b9t \u25e6 h\u0303t \u25e6 \u03c4\u0303\n= \u03c6t\nwhere the last equality follows as both \u03c4\u0303 and h\u0303t are the identity on D.

Let [\u03a3B , h0 , \u03a3B\n([\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P\u2217 , \u03c60 ]) for some local inverse P \u22121 of P.

Let \u03b3 be a local holomorphic section of the fundamental projection \u03a6 in a neighborhood of [\u03a3B , h0 , \u03a3B\n\u2217,0 ], and choose U to be an open set in the domain of \u03b3 containing this\npoint. Given u \u2208 U we choose a representative [\u03a3B , hu , \u03a3B\n1 ] = u such that \u03bc(hu ) = \u03b3(u).\n\u22121\nBy Remark 3.16, \u03bc(hu ) 7\u2192 \u03bc(h\u0303u \u25e6 \u03b1 ) is holomorphic. Therefore, since \u03b3 is holomorphic,\nthe map\nU \u2192 L\u221e\n\u22121,1 (\u03a3G )\nu 7\u2192 \u03bc(h\u0303u \u25e6 \u03b1\u22121 )\nis holomorphic and in particular continuous.\nWe now show in general that w \u03bc (z) and hence f \u03bc (z) are jointly continuous in \u03bc and z.\nLet Dr = {z : |z| < r} for some r > 1. Fix \u03bc0 and z0 . By [4, Theorem 4.7.4], for any \u01eb > 0\nthere is a \u03b41 so that if k\u03bc \u2212 \u03bc0 k < \u03b41 then |w\u03bc (z) \u2212 w\u03bc0 (z)| < \u01eb/2 for all z \u2208 Dr . On the\nother hand, since w\u03bc0 is continuous in z there is a \u03b42 such that |w\u03bc0 (z) \u2212 w\u03bc0 (z0 )| < \u01eb/2 for\nall |z \u2212 z0 | < \u03b42 . We can assume that \u03b42 is small enough that the disk of radius \u03b42 centered\non z0 is contained in Dr . Thus for |z \u2212 z0 | < \u03b42 and k\u03bc \u2212 \u03bc0 k < \u03b41\n|w\u03bc (z) \u2212 w\u03bc0 (z0 )| \u2264 |w\u03bc (z) \u2212 w\u03bc0 (z)| + |w\u03bc0 (z) \u2212 w\u03bc0 (z0 )| < \u01eb.\nSo w \u03bc (z) is jointly continuous in \u03bc and z for all z \u2208 D and hence so is f \u03bc (z).\nBy applying this fact with \u03bc = \u03bc(h\u0303 \u25e6 \u03b1\u22121 ), we have that\n(u, z) 7\u2192 f \u03bc (z)\nis continuous.\nIn the following let D(\u03b6, R) denote the disc of radius R centered on \u03b6. Let B be as in Section\n3.1 (recall that we are assuming that there is a single puncture). Since each (\u03c3 \u25e6 f \u03bc \u25e6 \u03b1)(\u2202\u03a3B )\nis compact, there is an r so that D(\u03be, r) \u2282 B for all \u03be \u2208 (\u03c3 \u25e6 f \u03bc \u25e6 \u03b1)(\u2202\u03a3B ). By the continuity\nof f \u03bc (\u03b6) in both \u03bc and \u03b6 for each \u03b6 \u2208 \u03b1(\u2202\u03a3B ), and by letting \u03be = (\u03c3 \u25e6 f \u03bc )(z), one can choose\n\u03bc\nan open neighborhood U\u03be = D(z, \u03b4\u03be ) \u00d7 W\u03be of (z, [\u03a3B , h0 , \u03a3B\n\u2217,0 ]) so that f (\u03b6) \u2282 B(\u03be, r) for all\nB\nB\nB\n\u03b6 \u2208 D(z, \u03b4\u03be ) and [\u03a3 , hu , \u03a31 ] \u2208 W\u03be . Since \u03b1(\u2202\u03a3 ) is compact, its open cover by the union of\nD(z, \u03b4\u03be ) has a finite subcovering D(z1 , \u03b4\u03be1 ), . . . , D(zm , \u03b4\u03bem ). The open set A0 = W\u03be1 \u2229* * *\u2229W\u03bem\nhas the desired properties.\n\u0003\nFix a point z0 \u2208 \u03b1(D0 ). Choose Q \u2282 D0 to be an open neighborhood of z0 such that there\nexists a local holomorphic section s of \u03c0G : U \u2192 U/G = \u03a3G defined on (\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03c4 )(Q). Let\n\u03c0 = \u03c0 \u03bc , which is independent of \u03bc by Lemma 3.13 and Proposition 3.14. For z \u2208 Q we can\nnow write \u039b in terms of w \u03bc and fixed maps as follows:\n(3.9)\n\n\u03bc\n\u039b([\u03a3B , h, \u03a3B\n1 ]) = \u03c3 \u25e6 (\u03c0 \u25e6 w \u25e6 s) \u25e6 \u03b1 \u25e6 \u03c4\u0303 .\n\nWith the aid of Theorem 3.8, we can now proceed with the proof that \u039b is holomorphic.\nLemma 3.22. Let t 7\u2192 [\u03a3B , ht , \u03a3B\nt ] be a holomorphic curve in AB . For any z \u2208 D, \u03c6t (z) =\n\u039b([\u03a3B , ht , \u03a3B\n])(z)\nand\nall\nits\nderivatives\nin z are holomorphic in t.\nt\nProof. We first show that the claim holds for a neighborhood of any fixed z0 in D0 . By the\nexistence of holomorphic sections of the fundamental projection the curve t 7\u2192 [\u03a3B , ht , \u03a3B\nt ]\n\u221e\nB\nis the image of a holomorphic curve in L\u22121,1 (\u03a3 )1 . We can thus assume without loss of\ngenerality that our representatives (\u03a3B , ht , \u03a3B\nt ) are such that t 7\u2192 \u03bc(ht ) is holomorphic in\n17\n\n\ft. Thus the maps t 7\u2192 \u03bct = \u03bc(h\u0303t ) and t 7\u2192 w \u03bct (z) are holomorphic in t as in the proof of\nLemma 3.18.\nLet C = \u03b1(D0 ) be the cap on \u03a3G . Since \u03bct is zero on C, w \u03bct (z) is holomorphic in z for\nz \u2208 s(C). Therefore, it is a holomorphic function of t and z and hence all its derivatives are\nalso holomorphic functions of both variables. The statement for \u03c6t then follows from (3.9)\nfor all z in some neighborhood Q of z0 . This proves the claim for z 6= 0.\nTo prove the claim for z0 = 0, observe that for all t, \u03c6t (0) = p. So in fact we know that\n\u03c6t (z) is holomorphic in z for fixed t for all z \u2208 D. Furthermore, clearly \u03c6t (0) is holomorphic\nin t. Thus \u03c6 is holomorphic in t and z separately and so by Hartog's theorem \u03c6 is jointly\nholomorphic in both t and z. Thus all the derivatives of \u03c6 with respect to z are holomorphic\nin t for any fixed z \u2208 D.\n\u0003\nFix the point [\u03a3B , h0 , \u03a3B\n\u2217,0 ] \u2208 FB , and let Bi i = 1, . . . , n and A0 be as in Lemma 3.21;\nit is possible to choose the Bi to be non-overlapping. Let \u03b6i : Bi \u2192 D, i = 1, . . . , n be\nn\nbiholomorphisms. From Remark 3.1 there is a corresponding chart T : Oqc (\u03a3P\u2217 ) \u2192 Oqc\non the open subset V = {\u03c6 \u2208 Oqc (\u03a3P\u2217 ) | \u03c6i (D) \u2282 Bi } containing \u039b([\u03a3B , h0 , \u03a3B\n0 ]), given by\nT ((\u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6n )) = (\u03b61 \u25e6 \u03c61 , . . . , \u03b6n \u25e6 \u03c6n ).\nTheorem 3.23. There exists an open neighborhood A0 of [\u03a3B , h0 , \u03a3B\n\u2217,0 ] \u2208 AB such that\nP\n\u039b : A0 \u2192 Oqc (\u03a3\u2217 ) is holomorphic.\nProof. Choose A0 as in Lemma 3.21 and the preceding paragraph.\nUsing Theorems 3.7 and 3.8 it is enough to show weak G\u00e2teaux-holomorphy and local\nboundedness. As before we temporarily drop the subscript i for ease of notation.\nLet \u03c6t be as in Lemma 3.22 where it was proved that t 7\u2192 \u03c6t (z) is holomorphic in t. The\ncomplex structure on Oqc (\u03a3P\u2217 ) is defined by\n\u03c7\n\nT\n\nOqc (\u03a3P\u2217 ) \u2212\u2192 Oqc \u2212\u2192 A1\u221e \u2295 C.\nRecall from Section 3.1 that \u03c7(f ) = (A(f ), f \u2032(0)) where A(f ) = f \u2032\u2032 /f \u2032. Let \u03c8t = T (\u03c6t ) =\n\u03b6 \u25e6 \u03c6t . We now need to prove that t 7\u2192 \u03c7(T (\u03c6t )) satisfies condition (1) of Theorem 3.8.\nThis is immediate for the second component of \u03c7 because \u03c6t (0) is holomorphic in t. Since\n\u03c6t (z) and its derivatives are holomorphic in t for fixed z, we see that\nt 7\u2192 (A(\u03c8t ))(z)\nis also holomorphic in t. Define Ez : A1\u221e \u2192 C by Ez (f ) = f (z). These point evaluation maps\nare continuous linear functionals for z \u2208 D. If \u03a9 is an open subset of D then {Ez | z \u2208 \u03a9}\nis a separating set of functionals because the holomorphic functions are determined by their\nvalues on an open set.\nBy Theorem 3.8 it remains to show that \u039b is locally bounded. From the definition of the\ncomplex structure on Oqc (\u03a3P\u2217 ) we must prove that \u03c7 \u25e6 T \u25e6 \u039b is locally bounded.\nIt suffices to show that each component of \u03c7 \u25e6 T \u25e6 \u039b in A1\u221e \u2295 C is bounded uniformly on\nA0 . For any element of A0 the corresponding map\n\u03c8 = \u03b6 \u25e6 \u03c3 \u25e6 f \u03bc \u25e6 \u03b1 \u25e6 \u03c4\u0303 \u2208 Oqc\nis a holomorphic map from D to D satisfying \u03c8(0) = 0. By the Schwarz lemma\n|(\u03c8 \u2032(0)| \u2264 1.\n18\n\n\fFurthermore, by an elementary estimate for univalent maps of the disk (using again the\nabove bound on the first derivative)\n|(1 \u2212 |z|2 )A(\u03c8)(z) \u2212 2z\u0304| \u2264 4\nso\n||A(\u03c8)||1,\u221e \u2264 6.\n\u0003\nBy Theorem 3.20 and the preceding theorem we now conclude that \u039b \u25e6 P \u22121 is a local\nholomorphic inverse of L.\n4. Coordinates on the Teichm\u00fcller space T (\u03a3B )\nSchiffer variation together with coordinates on the fibers FB provide local holomorphic\ncoordinate charts for the infinite-dimensional Teichm\u00fcller space T (\u03a3B ).\nLet S : \u03a9 \u2192 T (\u03a3P ) be the coordinates in a neighborhood of [\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P\u2217 ] \u2282 T (\u03a3P ) obtained\nby Schiffer variation as described in Theorem 2.17. Let \u03a3P\u01eb = (\u03a3P\u2217 )\u01eb and recall that f \u01eb = \u03bd \u01eb \u25e6f .\nNote in particular that for any \u01eb 6= 0 in \u03a9, S(\u01eb) 6= [\u03a3P , f, \u03a3P\u2217 ]. This implies that Schiffer\nvariation in \u03a3B is transverse to the fibers FB .\nLet (T, V ) be a chart on Oqc (\u03a3P\u2217 ) as in Section 3.1. Recall that this chart can be chosen\nso that for all \u03c6 \u2208 V , \u03c6(D0 ) is contained in some fixed open B \u2282 \u03a3P\u2217 . Now choose the\nneighborhoods Ui , i = 1, . . . , d, on which the Schiffer variation is to be performed, to be\ndisjoint from B.\nLet f\u03c6 be as in Corollary 3.3.\nTheorem 4.1. The map\n(\u03a9 \u00d7 V ) \u2192 T (\u03a3B )\n(\u01eb, \u03c6) 7\u2192 [\u03a3B , (f\u03c6 )\u01eb , (\u03a3P\u2217 \\ \u03c6(Dn0 ))\u01eb ]\nis biholomorphic onto its image.\nProof. Because P is a local biholomorphism, it is sufficient that\nG : (\u03a9 \u00d7 V ) \u2192 TeP (\u03a3P )\n\n(\u01eb, \u03c6) 7\u2192 [\u03a3P , \u03bd \u01eb \u25e6 f, \u03a3P\u01eb , \u03bd \u01eb \u25e6 \u03c6]\n\nis a biholomorphism onto its image. That G is injective follows directly from the definition\nof TeP (\u03a3P ) and the facts: (1) S : \u03a9 \u2192 T (\u03a3P ) is injective, and (2) \u03a3P has no non-identity\nautomorphisms that are homotopic to the identity since 2g \u2212 2 + n > 0.\nFirst, we show that this map is holomorphic. By Hartog's theorem is enough to show\nthat the map is separately holomorphic (see [9] for a version of this theorem in infinite\ndimensions). Fixing \u03c6, by Theorem 2.18 the map \u01eb 7\u2192 [\u03a3B , f\u03c6\u01eb , (\u03a3P\u2217 \\ \u03c6(Dn0 ))\u01eb ] is holomorphic.\nThus since P is holomorphic, G is holomorphic in \u01eb. Now fix \u01eb, and consider the map\ncorresponding to the second component of G:\nH : V \u2192 TeP (\u03a3P )\n\n\u03c6 7\u2192 [\u03a3P , \u03bd \u01eb \u25e6 f, \u03a3P\u01eb , \u03bd \u01eb \u25e6 \u03c6].\n19\n\n\fNow H can be written as H2 \u25e6 H1 where H1 and H2 are given by\nH1 : V \u2192 Oqc (\u03a3P\u01eb )\n\u03c6 7\u2192 \u03bd \u01eb \u25e6 \u03c6\nand\nH2 : Oqc (\u03a3P\u01eb ) \u2192 TeP (\u03a3P )\n\n\u03be 7\u2192 [\u03a3P , \u03bd \u01eb \u25e6 f, \u03a3P\u01eb , \u03be].\n\nH2 is holomorphic by Theorem 3.2, so it remains to show that H1 is holomorphic.\nLet \u03b6 be the collection of local biholomorphisms of neighborhoods of the punctures on \u03a3P\u2217\ncorresponding to the chart (T, V ) on Oqc (\u03a3P\u2217 ). Let (T\u01eb , V\u01eb ) be the chart on Oqc (\u03a3P\u01eb ) and \u03b6\u01eb\nbe the corresponding local biholomorphism of \u03a3P\u01eb . We need to show that T\u01eb \u25e6 H1 \u25e6 T \u22121 is\nholomorphic, i.e. that the map\n\u03b6 \u25e6 \u03c6 7\u2192 \u03b6\u01eb \u25e6 \u03bd\u01eb \u25e6 \u03c6 = (\u03b6\u01eb \u25e6 \u03bd\u01eb \u25e6 \u03b6 \u22121 ) \u25e6 (\u03b6 \u25e6 \u03c6)\nis holomorphic on Oqc . Composition on the left by a biholomorphism is a local biholomorphism of Oqc by [13, Lemma 3.10], which establishes the claim.\nFinally we need to show that G\u22121 is holomorphic. By Theorem 3.2 and the fact that\nSchiffer variation provides a section of the fiber projection, it is clear that the derivative of\nG is an injective linear map at each point for which G is defined. Since G is holomorphic\nand in particular C 1 , we can apply the inverse function theorem [5] to show that G has a C 1\ninverse. The derivative of G\u22121 is also complex linear so G\u22121 is holomorphic.\n\u0003\nReferences\n1. Chae, S. B. Holomorphy and calculus in normed spaces. With an appendix by Angus E. Taylor.
