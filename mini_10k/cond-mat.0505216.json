Here, we show that a very similar equation\ncan be derived, in a systematic manner, for a classical fluid by assuming nonlinear response,\ni.e. that the diffusive flux depends on gradients of a power of the concentration. The present\nequation distinguishes\u221afrom the porous media equation in that it describes generalized classical\ndiffusion, i.e. with r/ Dt scaling, but with a generalized Einstein relation, and with power-law\nprobability distributions typical of nonextensive statistical mechanics.\n\nOne of the characteristic features of the nonextensive thermodynamics introduced by Tsallis is the appearance of non-exponential distribution functions with power-law tails [1,2]. There\nhas been considerable interest recently in the question of how such non-exponential distributions might arise from first-principle considerations [3\u20136]. In this paper, we show that it is\npossible to obtain, in a generic manner, power-law distributions for the diffusion of a tracer\nparticle in a liquid by assuming a simple generalization of the usual linear response arguments.\n\u2192\nIn classical transport theory, the probability to find the diffuser at point \u2212\nr at time t given\n\u2192\n\u2212\nthat it starts at point r 0 at time 0 obeys the advection-diffusion equation\n\u2192 \u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202 \u2212\n\u2202 \u2190\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\nP (\u2212\nr , t; \u2212\nr 0 , 0) = \u2212\n*\u2192\nu (\u2212\nr , t) P (\u2212\nr , t; \u2212\nr 0 , 0) + \u2212\n* D * \u2212\nP (\u2212\nr , t; \u2212\nr 0 , 0) ,\n(1)\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u2192\nr\n\u2202\u2192\nr\n\u2202\u2192\nr\n\u2190\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\nwhere \u2212\nu (\u2212\nr , t) is the drift and D the diffusion tensor, see e.g. [7]. Note that in general,\nwe could, instead of probabilities, speak of the concentration of a diffusing species or the\ndensity of a single-component system undergoing self-diffusion just as well. There are currently\ntwo widely explored generalizations of this classical diffusion equation. The first involves a\nfractional time derivative in the diffusion term [8]. This fractional diffusion equation can\nbe derived, e.g., by considering the behavior of a diffuser on a lattice with the waiting time\nbetween hops being governed by a power-law distribution (e.g., a Pareto distribution), a type\nof Levy flight [8]. A second generalization of the classical diffusion equation sometimes used\nto model anomalous diffusion is the so-called \"porous media equation\"\n\u2192 \u2202 \u03bc \u2212\n\u2202 \u2212\n\u2202 \u2190\n\u2202\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\nP (\u2212\nr , t; \u2192\nr 0 , 0) = \u2212\n*\u2192\nu (\u2212\nr , t) P (\u2212\nr , t; \u2212\nr 0 , 0) + \u2212\n* D * \u2212\nP (\u2192\nr , t; \u2212\nr 0 , 0) .\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2202t\n\u2202r\n\u2202r\n\u2202\u2192\nr\nc EDP Sciences\n\n(2)\n\n\f2\n\nEUROPHYSICS LETTERS\n\nAs its name indicates, this equation was established (empirically) for particular physical systems [9], and, recently, its formal structure, \u2202t f = \u2206(f \u03bc ), has been analyzed in the mathematical literature [10]; it has also been proposed as a phenomenological \"nonextensive\" generaliza\u2192\n\u2192\ntion of classical diffusion [11, 12].

Since concentration-dependent and density-dependent\ndiffusion coefficients are commonly used in the scientific literature, this does not differ radically from classical diffusion: what is unusual is that the effective diffusion coefficient vanishes\nwhen the probability (or concentration) vanishes.\nWe consider here a collection of atoms moving under Newtonian dynamics and concentrate\n\u2192\non describing the probability of finding a tagged particle, say the 0-th particle, at position \u2212\nr\n\u2192\n\u2212\nat time t given it begins at position r 0 at time t = 0,\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\nP (\u2212\nr , t; \u2212\nr , 0) = h\u03b4 (\u2212\nq (t) \u2212 \u2212\nr ) \u03b4 (\u2212\nq (0) \u2212 \u2212\nr )i ,\n(6)\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u2212\nwhere the position of the tagged particle is \u2192\nq (t) and the notation h...i0 indicates an ensemble average over some distribution of initial conditions for the other, non-tagged, particles.\nDifferentiation of Eq.(6) with respect to time leads to the exact equation\n\u2202 \u2212\n\u2202 \u2212\n\u2192\n\u2202\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2212\nP (\u2212\nr , t; \u2212\nr 0 , 0) = \u2212\n*\u2192\nu (\u2212\nr , t) P (\u2212\nr , t; \u2192\nr 0 , 0) + \u2212\n*J ,\n(7)\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2202t\n\u2202r\n\u2202r\nwith the current\n\u2192 \u2212\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\nJ (\u2192\nr , t; \u2212\nr 0 , 0) = h\u2212\nv \u2032 (t) \u03b4 (\u2212\nq (t) \u2212 \u2212\nr ) \u03b4 (\u2212\nq (0) \u2212 \u2212\nr 0 )i0 ,\n(8)\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\nwhere u ( r , t) is the average macroscopic velocity, v (t) is the instantaneous velocity of the\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\ntagged particle and its peculiar velocity is \u2212\nv \u2032 (t) = \u2212\nv (t) \u2212 \u2212\nu (\u2212\nr , t). The idea of linear response theory is that, aside from convection and in the absence of driving forces or boundary\nconditions, the distribution should relax toward a uniform distribution.

In general, the diffusion coefficient, which is\ngiven by an Einstein relation, is time dependent on microscopic time scales characterized by\nthe time between atomic collisions, but in the long-time limit appropriate to hydrodynamics\nit tends toward a constant value.\nComparison of Eqs.(2) and (7) suggests that the key assumption in the use of the generalized diffusion equation is that the current is no longer most simply described by gradients in\nthe distribution function, but rather by gradients in the distribution raised to some power.

Lutsko and Jean Pierre Boon : Nonextensive diffusion as nonlinear response5\n\ndescriptions can be regarded in any sense as being the same. In some cases they are, because Eq.(16) is of first order in the time so that any time-dependence generated by the\nself-consistency can be hidden by a non-linear change in the time variable. For example, in\n\u2192\n\u2192\nthe absence of drift, let Q (\u2212\nr , s; \u2212\nr 0 , 0) be a solution to Eq.(2), written with the variable s\n\u2192\n\u2192\ninstead of t, and having initial condition P (\u2212\nr , 0; \u2212\nr 0 , 0). Then it is easy to see that the solu\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\ntion of Eq.(16) is P ( r , t; r 0 , 0) = Q ( r , s (t) ; r 0 , 0) where the time variables are related by\nthe implicit equation\n\u0013\nZ s \u0012Z\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\nd\u2212\nr Q\u03bc (\u2212\nr , \u03c3; \u2212\nr , 0) d\u03c3 .\n(25)\nt (s) =\n0\n\n0\n\nTo illustrate, consider again the case of one dimensional diffusion with no drift term. The\nsolution of the porous media equation (2) is given by (4) which, with the replacement t \u2192 s,\nis what is called here Q. Substitution into Eq.(25) gives\n\u0013\nZ s \u0012Z\n2\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\nd\u2212\nr Q\u03bc (\u2212\nr , \u03c3; \u2212\nr 0 , 0) d\u03c3 = Cs \u03bc+1 ,\nt (s) =\n(26)\n0\n\nfor some constant C , thus recovering Eq.(22).\nIt is interesting that Eq.(16) is very similar to the equation recently derived by Abe and\nThurner [6] where the derivation begins with the classical picture based on a random walker\nwhich jumps from position r + \u2206 at time t to position r at time t + \u03c4 with a jump probability\n\u03c6 (\u2206) = \u03c6 (\u2212\u2206), so that the probability that the walker be at r at time t + \u03c4 is given by\nZ\nP (r, t + \u03c4 ) = P (r + \u2206, t) \u03c6 (\u2206) d\u2206 .\n(27)\nThey consider the more general case in which the probability P (r, t) occuring in the integral\nis replaced by the so-called escort probability\nF (r, t) = R\n\nP \u03bd (r, t)\n,\nP \u03bd (r, t) dr\n\n(28)\n\nwith the result that the diffusion equation becomes\n\u2202\n1\n\u22022\n\u2192\n\u2192\nr , t) + (F (r, t) \u2212 P (\u2212\nP (r, t) = D\u03bd (t) 2 P \u03bd (\u2212\nr , t; )) ,\n\u2202t\n\u2202r\n\u03c4\n\n(29)\n\nwith D\u03bd (t) defined as in Eq.(15). Equation (29) is somewhat difficult to interpret as its\nderivation involves taking the limit \u03c4 \u2192 0 in which case the second term on the right is\nproblematic. Apart from this problem, the result is strikingly similar to our nonlinear-response\nresult including the definition of the time-dependent diffusion coefficient (see Eq.(15) in [6]).\nComparison of the results also indicates that \"nonextensive\" expressions can arise without\nthe explicit introduction of escort probabilities.\nIn this paper, we have developed a method whereby a statistical mechanical derivation\nyields typically nonextensive expressions by generalizing a key ansatz, i.e. a generalization\nof standard linear response arguments which gives rise to a q-diffusion equation including a\ngeneralization of the Einstein relation for the diffusion coefficient. The equation is similar in\nstructure to the porous media equation, but with the important difference that the diffusion\ncoefficient depends on the solution of the equation which leads to the fact that, in the absence\nof drift, the diffusion process is classical with mean-squared displacement increasing linearly\nwith time. The new q-diffusion equation admits of the well known q-exponential distribution\nwhich is often postulated as the signature of nonequilibrium systems.\n\n\f6\n\nEUROPHYSICS LETTERS\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] H.L.
