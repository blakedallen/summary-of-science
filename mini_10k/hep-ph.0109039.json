The authors extracted F (x, q\u22a5 ) from a fit to F2 data and\nobtained an excellent \u03c72 /NDOF with the use of the following integrated gluon\ndistribution at an input scale of Q20 = 1 GeV2\nxg(x, Q20 = 1GeV2 ) = 1.57(1 \u2212 x)2.5\n3\n\n(4)\n\n\fFig. 4. bb\u0304-correlations\n\nwhich enters the calculation through the relation\n2\n\ng(x, Q ) =\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n2\n\nZQ0\n0\n\n+\n\nZQ\n\nQ20\n\n\uf8f6\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\uf8f7 2 F (x, k\u22a5 )\n\uf8f8 dk\u22a5\n2\n\nk\u22a5\n\n=\n\nxg(x, Q20 )\n\n+\n\nZQ\n\nQ20\n\n2\n\n2\ndk\u22a5\n\n2\nF (x, k\u22a5\n)\n.

Our result for the production of a single bottom\nquark is shown in fig. 3 in comparison to data from the Tevatron collider [5]\nand NLO calculations in the collinear approach. The error band is due to a\nsimultaneous variation of the bottom quark mass 4.5 GeV < mb < 4.9 GeV\nnf =5\nand the fundamental scale 100 MeV< \u03bbQCD\n< 180 MeV, while the scale de2\npendence of the coupling constant \u03b1S (\u03bc2 ) is chosen to be \u03bc2 = q1,2\u22a5\n+ m2 .\nWe find in contrast to the NLO collinear calculation a good agreement between the k\u22a5 -factorization prediction and the experimental values over the\nwhole range of k1\u22a5 . Likewise important is the comparison to measurements of\nbb\u0304-correlations [6] in fig. 4. Allthough the cross section (1) is only of LO in \u03b1S ,\nthe k\u22a5 -factorization together with the effective production vertex and off-shell\ngluons gives a very good despription of the data which lie about a factor of 3\nabove the NLO collinear result.\n\n2\n\nCharmonium production\n\nMotivated by the results for heavy quark production we now pass over to\nthe hadroproduction of charmonia which is a far more controversial subject\n[7,8]. We consider the production of the \u03c7c , which is a 3 PJ -state and the J/\u03a8,\n4\n\n\fFig. 5. \u03c7c -meson-production\n\nwhich is a 3 S1 state in the framework of the non-relativistic-QCD (NRQCD)\napproach and have therefore to include the color singlet and color octet contributions to the final color singlet bound states. The calculation is again based\non the cross section formula (1) and the unintegrated gluon distribution from\n[4]. The details of the calculations and the binding mechanisms cc\u0304 \u2192 \u03c7c , J/\u03a8\nare explained in [9,10]. Because the color octet contributions depend linearly\non the so called color octet matrix elements (COME) which at the moment\ncannot be calculated but have to be fitted to the data [11,12], the following\nresults should not to be seen as predictions of the corresponding differential\ncross sections but are required in order to extract the sizes of the COME.\nThe results for the production of the J/\u03a8 from radiative \u03c7c -decay in the\nk\u22a5 -factorization are shown on the left side of fig. 5 together with experimental data from the Tevatron and a NLO collinear calculation. It is clear from\n8\nthe figure that the 3 S1 -contribution to \u03c7c is generally suppressed due to the\nflat slope of the curve in comparison to the data. The flat curve originates\nfrom the additional part of the effective vertex in equation (3) which contains\n2\nfactors t1,2 \u2248 q1,2\u22a5\nand leads to a strong suppression of the corresponding\nCOME with respect to the results from collinear calculations. Furthermore\nthe Landau-Yang-Theorem, forbidding the production of the \u03c7cJ=1 -state in\nLO collinear factorization, is not valid in our approach because the gluons are\noff-shell. This becomes obvious in a rather impressive way on the right hand\nside of fig. 5 where the individual \u03c7cJ=1- and \u03c7cJ=2-contributions are plotted.\nFig. 6 shows our results for direct J/\u03a8-production in the k\u22a5 -factorization\nframework in comparison to data and the NLO color singlet collinear predic8\n8\ntion [10]. Although in this case the color octet contributions 3 PJ , 1 S0 play\n8\nan important role, the 3 S1 -part is suppressed following the same reasons as in\nthe \u03c7c -production. This leads again to a strong reduction of the corresponding\n8\nCOME h0| OJ/\u03a8 (3 S1 ) |0i with respect to the collinear result. This in turn has a\ndefinite influence on the production of polarized J/\u03a8 [10,13] and could clarify\nthe so far unsolved puzzle concerning the disagreement between recent experimental results and the NLO collinear predictions of transversally polarized\ncharmonia [14\u201317].
