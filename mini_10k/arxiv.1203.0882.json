The work has useful application in the development of a\ncomplete OCR system for handwritten Bangla text.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\nOptical Character Recognition (OCR) is still an active area of research, especially for handwritten text.\nSuccess of the commercially available OCR system is yet to be extended to handwritten text. It is mainly\ndue to the fact that numerous variations in writing styles of individuals make recognition of handwritten\ncharacters difficult. Past work on OCR of handwritten alphabet and numerals has been mostly found to\nconcentrate on Roman script [3], related to English and some European languages, and scripts related to\nAsian languages like Chinese [2], Korean, and Japanese.\nAmong Indian scripts, Devnagri, Tamil, Oriya and Bangla have started to receive attention for\nOCR related research in the recent years. Out of these, Bangla is the second most popular script and\nlanguage in the Indian subcontinent. As a script, it is used for Bangla, Ahamia and Manipuri languages.\nBangla, which is also the national language of Bangladesh, is the fifth most popular language in the\nworld. So is the importance of Bangla both as a script and as a language. But evidences of research on\nOCR of handwritten Bangla characters, as observed in the literature, are a few in numbers.\nTwo of the important research contributions relating to OCR of Bangla characters involve a\nmultistage approach developed by Rahman et al. [1] and an MLP classifier developed by Bhowmik et al.\n[4]. The major features used for the multistage approach include Matra, upper part of the character,\ndisjoint section of the character, vertical line and double vertical line. And, for the MLP classifier, the\nfeature set is constructed from the stroke feature of characters. The data set used for testing recognition\nperformances of the multistage approach was not of considerable size as it included characters of 49\ndifferent classes collected from only 20 different writers. Compared to this, a moderately large size data\nset of 25,000 samples, collected from different sections of population, is used for testing performances of\nthe MLP classifier. The size of the input feature vector chosen for the work is 200.\nNot only because of numerous variation of writing styles of different individuals but also for the\ncomplex nature of Bangla alphabet, automatic recognition of handwritten Bangla characters still poses\nsome potential problems to the researchers. Compared to Roman alphabet, basic Bangla alphabet consists\nProc. of the 2nd National Conf. on Computer Processing of Bangla, pp. 285-291, Feb-2005, Dhaka.\n\n\fof a much larger number of characters. The number of characters in basic Bangla alphabet is 50. And\nsome characters therein resemble pair wise so closely that the only sign of small difference left between\nthem is a period or a small line. Handwritten samples of all 50 symbols of basic Bangla alphabet are\nshown in Fig 1.\nIn the light of above facts, the present work considers a feature set of 76 features, smaller than the\none previously used by Bhowmik et al. (2005), for recognition of handwritten Bangla alphabet using an\nMLP based classifier. Due to the non-availability of some standardized data set, recognition performances\nof the present work cannot be compared with the others. However, for the currently available data set, the\nwork shows satisfactory recognition performances with some specific suggestions to be tried in future for\nfurther performance enhancement.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\nFig 1.

THE FEATURE SET\nThe feature set selected for the present work consists of 76 features, which include 24 shadow features, 16\ncentroid features and 36 longest-run features. The features are computed from 64x64 pixel size binary\nimages of alphabetic characters.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n(e)\nFig 2.

Shadow Features\nFor computing shadow features, each character image is enclosed within a minimal square, divided into\neight octants, as shown in Fig. 2. Lengths of projections of character images on three sides of each octant\nare then computed. Finally lengths of all such projections on each of the 24 sides of all octants are\nsummed up to produce 24 shadow features of the character image under consideration. For taking the\nprojection of an image segment on one side of an octant, existence of a fictitious light source in the\nopposite side is assume. Directions of light rays so assume for each side of all octants in a minimal square\nare shown in Fig 2(a-d). Shadow features of a sample character image are illustrated also in Fig 2(e).\n\nProc. of the 2nd National Conf. on Computer Processing of Bangla, pp. 285-291, Feb-2005, Dhaka.\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig 3(a-b). Centroid features of two different character images\n\n2.2. Centriod Features\nCoordinates of centroids of black pixels in all the 8 octants of a digit image are considered to add 16\nfeatures in all to the feature set. Fig 3 (a-b) show approximate locations of all such centroids on two\ndifferent character images. It is noteworthy how these features can be of help to distinguish the two\nimages.\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n\n4\n0\n0\n0\n0\n2\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n\n4\n2\n2\n0\n0\n2\n\n1 1\n0 1\n0 1\n0 0\n0 0\n1 1\n(a)\n\n4 4\n2 0\n2 0\n1 0\n1 0\n0 0\nSum =\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\nLength of the\nLongest Bar\n4\n2\n2\n1\n1\n2\n12\n\n(b)\nFig 4.

Longest-run Features\nFor computing longest-run features from a character image, the minimal square enclosing the image is\ndivided into 9 overlapping rectangular regions. Coordinates (r, c) of top left corners of all these regions\nare given as follows: {(r, c) | r=0, h/4, 2h/4 and c=0, w/4, 2w/4}, where h and w denote the height and the\n\nProc. of the 2nd National Conf. on Computer Processing of Bangla, pp. 285-291, Feb-2005, Dhaka.\n\n\fwidth of the minimal square respectively. In each such rectangular region, 4 longest-run features are\ncomputed row wise, column wise and along two of its major diagonals.\nThe row wise longest-run feature is computed by considering the sum of the lengths of the longest\nbars that fit consecutive black pixels along each of all the rows of a rectangular region, as illustrated in\nFig. 4. The three other longest-run features are computed in the same way but along the column wise and\ntwo major diagonal wise directions within the rectangle separately. Thus, in all, 9x4=36 longest-run\nfeatures are computed from each character image.\n\n3. THE MLP CLASSIFIER\nThe MLP is a special kind of Artificial Neural Network (ANN). ANNs are developed to replicate\nlearning and generalization abilities of human's behavior with an attempt to model the functions of\nbiological neural networks of the human brain.\nArchitecturally, an MLP is a feed-forward layered network of artificial neurons. Each artificial\nneuron in the MLP computes a sigmoid function of the weighted sum of all its inputs. An MLP consists of\none input layer, one output layer and a number of hidden or intermediate layers, as shown in Fig 5. The\noutput from every neuron in a layer of the MLP is connected to all inputs of each neuron in the immediate\nnext layer of the same. Neurons in the input layer of the MLP are all basically dummy neurons as they are\nused simply to pass on the input to the next layer just by computing an identity function each.\nThe numbers of neurons in the input and the output layers of an MLP are chosen depending on\nthe problem to be solved. The number of neurons in other layers and the number of layers in the MLP are\nall determined by a trial and error method at the time of its training. An ANN requires training to learn an\nunknown input-output relationship to solve a problem.\n\nFig. 5. A block diagram of an MLP shown as a feed forward neural network.\n\nDepending on the models of ANNs, training is performed either under supervision of some\nteacher (i.e., with labeled data of known input-output responses) or without supervision. The MLP to be\nused for the present work requires supervised training. During training of an MLP weights or strengths of\nneuron-to-neuron connections, also called synapses, are iteratively tuned so that it can respond\nappropriately to all training data and also to other data, not considered at the time of training. Learning\nand generalization abilities of an ANN is determined on the basis of how best it can respond under these\ntwo respective situations.\n\nProc. of the 2nd National Conf. on Computer Processing of Bangla, pp. 285-291, Feb-2005, Dhaka.\n\n\fThe MLP classifier designed for the present work is trained with the Back Propagation (BP)\nalgorithm. It minimizes the sum of the squared errors for the training samples by conducting a gradient\ndescent search in the weight space. The number neurons in a hidden layer in the same are also adjusted\nduring its training.\nThe problem of pattern classification involves two successive transformations as follows:\nM\u2192F\u2192D\nwhere, M, F and D stand for the measurement space, the feature space and the decision space\nrespectively. Once a feature set is fixed up, it is left with the design of a mapping (\u03b4) as follows:\n\u03b4: F\u2192D\nANNs with their learning and generalization abilities can approximate a general class of functions\ngiven below.\nf:\nPattern classification with ANNs requires approximating \u03b4 as a discrete valued function shown\nbelow.\n\nwhere, n and m denotes the number of features and the number of pattern classes respectively. So an\nANN based pattern classifier requires n number of neurons in the input layer and m number of neurons in\nthe output layer. Conventionally 1-out-of-m representation is used for its output.\nTable 1.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nFor preparation of the training and the test sets of samples, a database of 10,000 alphabetic character\nsamples is formed by collecting optically scanned handwritten characters specimens of 50 alphabetic\nsymbols from each of 200 people of different age groups and sexes. A training set of 8000 samples and a\ntest set of 2000 samples are then formed through random selection of character samples of each class\nfrom the initial database in equal numbers. All these samples are scaled to 64x64 pixel images first and\nthen converted to binary images through thresholding.\nFor the present work, a single layer MLP, i.e., an MLP with one hidden layer is chosen. This is\nmainly to keep the computational requirement of the same low without affecting its function\napproximation capability. According to Universal Approximation theorem [5], a single hidden layer is\nsufficient to compute a uniform approximation to a given training set.\nTo design an MLP for classification of handwritten alphabetic characters, several runs of BP\nalgorithm with learning rate (\u03b7) = 0.8 and momentum term (\u03b1)=0.7 are executed for different numbers of\nneurons in its hidden layer. Recognition performances of the MLP on the training and the test sets\nobserved from this experimentation are given in Table1.\nCurves showing variation of the Recognition performance of the MLP, for both the test and the\ntraining sets, with increase in the number of neurons in its hidden layer are plotted in Fig. 6 from the\nTable 1. It is required to fix up the number of neurons in the hidden layer of MLP so that it can show the\noptimal recognition performance on the test set.\nRecognition performances of the MLP, as observed from the curve shown in Fig 6., initially rise\nas the number of neurons in the hidden layer is increased and falls after the same crosses some limiting\nvalue. It reflects the fact that for some fixed training and test sets, learning and generalization abilities of\nthe MLP improve as the number of neurons in its hidden layer as increases up to certain limiting value\nand any further increase in the number of neurons in the hidden layer thereafter degrades the abilities. It is\ncalled the over-fitting problem.\nThe optimal recognition performance of the MLP is observed at a point, on the curve of Fig.6,\nwhere the number of neurons in its hidden layer is set to 60. Thus the number of neurons in the hidden\nlayer of the MLP is finally fixed up to 60. With this, the design process is completed producing an MLP\n(76-60-50) for recognition of handwritten alphabet on the basis of the feature set explained before.\nRecognition performances of this MLP, as observed on the training and the test sets, are 86.46% and\n75.05% respectively.
