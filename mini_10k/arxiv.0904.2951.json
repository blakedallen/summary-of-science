Four such\npairs turn out to yield meaningful boundary conditions and their responses for an incident plane wave at a planar boundary are studied.\nThe theory is subsequently generalized to more general boundary surfaces defined by a coordinate function. It is found that two of the pairs\ncorrespond to the PEC and PMC conditions while the other two correspond to a mixture of PEC and PMC conditions for fields polarized\nTE or TM with respect to the coordinate defining the surface.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhen representing electromagnetic field problems as boundary-value problems the boundary conditions are generally defined in terms of fields tangential to the boundary surface. A typical example is that of impedance\nboundary conditions which can be expressed in the form [1, 2]\nn \u00d7 (E \u2212 Zs * (n \u00d7 H)) = 0,\n1\n\nn * Zs = Zs * n = 0,\n\n(1)\n\n\f2\nfor some surface impedance dyadic Zs which may have infinite components.\nHere, n is the unit vector normal to the boundary surface. Special cases for\nthe impedance boundary are the perfect electric counductor (PEC) boundary,\nZs = 0\n\n\u21d2\n\nn \u00d7 E = 0,\n\n(2)\n\nand the perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) boundary [3, 4],\nZs \u2192 \u221e,\n\n\u21d2\n\nn \u00d7 E = 0,\n\n(3)\n\nalso known as high-impedance surface [5, 6, 7]. A generalization of these is\nthe perfect electromagnetic conductor (PEMC) boundary defined by\nZs =\n\n1\nn \u00d7 I,\nM\n\n\u21d2\n\nn \u00d7 (ME + H) = 0,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere M is the PEMC admittance [8]. In fact, for M = 0 and 1/M = 0 (4)\nyields the respective PMC and PEC boundaries.\nA different set of boundary conditions involving normal components of\nthe vectors D and B at the boundary surface,\nn * D = 0,\n\nn*B=0\n\n(5)\n\nhas been recently introduced in [9, 10] in conjunction with electromagnetic\ncloaking and, independently, by these authors [11, 12, 13, 14]. A boundary\ndefined by the conditions (5) was dubbed DB boundary for brevity. The corresponding conditions for the E and H vectors depend on the medium in front\nof the boundary. In this study we assume a simple isotropic medium with\npermittivity \u01eb and permeability \u03bc, whence (5) is equivalent to the conditions\nn * E = 0,\n\nn * H = 0.\n\n(6)\n\nA more recent study of literature has revealed that the DB conditions either in the form of (5) or (6) have been considered much earlier. In fact,\nin 1959 V.H. Rumsey discussed the uniqueness of a problem involving the\nconditions (6) as well as their realization in terms of the interface of a uniaxially anisotropic medium [15]. The uniqueness and existence problems were\nconsidered more exactly in subsequent papers [16, 17, 18, 19, 20].\nThe DB-boundary conditions (5) were introduced by these authors in\n[13] as following from the interface conditions for the half space z < 0 of a\n\n\f3\ncertain exotic material called uniaxial IB or skewon-axion medium [21, 22].\nA more general proof is given in Appendix 1. A simpler realization for the\nDB boundary appears possible in terms of the planar interface z = 0 of a\nuniaxially anisotropic medium defined by the permittivity and permeability\ndyadics [15, 13]\n\u01eb = \u01ebz uz uz + \u01ebt It ,\n\n\u03bc = \u03bcz uz uz + \u03bct It ,\n\n(7)\n\nwith the transverse unit dyadic defined by\nIt = I \u2212 uz uz = ux ux + uy uy .\n\n(8)\n\nAssuming vanishing axial parameters, \u01ebz \u2192 0, \u03bcz \u2192 0, the fields in the\nuniaxial medium z < 0 satisfy Dz \u2192 0 and Bz \u2192 0, whence because of the\ncontinuity, the DB conditions (5) are valid at the interface z = 0. Such a\nuniaxial medium was dubbed zero axial parameter (ZAP) medium [23]. Obviously, the same principle applies for curved boundaries as well, when the\nmedium is locally uniaxial with vanishing normal components of permittivity\nand permeability. Zero-valued electromagnetic parameters and their applications have been studied recently together with their realizations in terms\nof metamaterials [24, 25, 26, 27].\nBasic properties of the DB boundary for electromagnetic fields have been\nrecently studied. In [13] it was shown that, since the Poynting vector has\nonly the normal component, the DB boundary is an isotropic soft surface in\nthe definition of Kildal [28, 29]. Thus, coupling between aperture antennas\non a DB plane is smaller than on a PEC plane. Further properties of a\nplanar DB boundary were analyzed in [14]. It was shown that the DB plane\ncan be replaced by a PEC plane for fields polarized TEz with respect to the\nnormal (z) direction and, by a PMC plane for TMz fields. Thus, radiation\nfrom a current source J in front of the DB plane can be found by splitting\nthe source in two parts, JTE radiating a TEz field and JTM radiating a TMz\nfield, whence the DB plane can be replaced by the images of the two source\ncomponents, PEC image for the TEz component and PMC image for the\nTMz component.\nIn [30] the resonator defined by a spherical DB boundary was studied.\nSplitting all modes in two sets, those polarized TEr and TMr with respect\nto the radial coordinate r, it was shown that the TEr and the TMr modes\nequal those of the respective PEC and PMC resonator. Thus, the number\nof modes with the same resonance frequency is double of that of the PEC\n\n\f4\nor PMC resonator which means that there is more freedom to define the\nresonance field.\nFinally, the circular waveguide defined by the DB boundary was analyzed\nin [31]. Since general modes cannot be decomposed in TE\u03c1 and TM\u03c1 parts\nwith respect to the polar radial coordinate \u03c1, the modes had to be computed\nin the classical way. It was shown that there may exist backward-wave modes\nin such a waveguide although there is no dispersion or periodic structure\ninvolved.\nThe objective of the present paper is to extend the concept of DB boundary by adding another set of conditions involving normal derivatives of the\nnormal field components. First, basic properties of the plane-wave reflected\nfrom planar boundaries satisfying different boundary conditions are derived,\nafter which the more general curved boundary defined by a coordinate function will be studied.\n\n2\n\nPlanar boundary conditions\n\nIn the following we consider a planar boundary defined by z = 0 and fields\nin the half space z \u2265 0. The DB condition (5) can be expressed as vanishing\nof the z components of the two fields,\nDz = 0,\n\nBz = 0,\n\n(9)\n\nat the boundary. If there are no sources at the boundary, the z components\nof the Maxwell equations yield conditions for the transverse components of\nthe fields as\n\u2207t \u00d7 Ht = 0,\n\u2207t \u00d7 Et = 0.\n(10)\nObviously, the conditions (10) are equivalent to (9).\nLet us now introduce another possible set of boundary conditions involving the normal derivatives of the field components at the planar surface:\n\u2202z Dz = 0,\n\n\u2202z Bz = 0,\n\n(11)\n\nand let us call such a boundary by the name D'B' boundary for brevity. If\nthere are no sources at the D'B' boundary, the fields D and B are solenoidal\nand they satisfy\n\u2207 * D = \u2202z Dz + \u2207t * Dt = 0,\n\n\u2207 * B = \u2202z Bz + \u2207t * Bt = 0.\n\n(12)\n\n\f5\nThus, the D'B' conditions (11) can be alternatively expressed in terms of the\ntransverse components of the fields as\n\u2207t * Dt = 0,\n\n\u2207t * Bt = 0.\n\n(13)\n\nIn an isotropic medium the D'B' conditions (11) and (13) are equivalent to\n\u2202z Ez = 0,\n\n\u2202z Hz = 0,\n\n(14)\n\n\u2207t * Et = 0,\n\n\u2207t * Ht = 0.\n\n(15)\n\nThere are two other combinations of the four conditions in (9) and (11)\nwhich may appear useful. According to the previous pattern, let us call the\nconditions\nDz = 0,\n\u2202z Bz = 0\n(16)\nas those of the DB' boundary and the conditions\n\u2202z Dz = 0,\n\nBz = 0\n\n(17)\n\nas those of the D'B boundary. In an isotropic medium (16) can be replaced\nby\n\u2207t \u00d7 Ht = 0, \u2207t * Ht = 0,\n(18)\nwhile the conditions (17) can be replaced by\n\u2207t * Et = 0,\n\n\u2207t \u00d7 Et = 0.\n\n(19)\n\nFrom (18) it follows that there exists a scalar potential \u03c8(x, y) in terms of\nwhich we can express the field Ht at the DB' boundary and \u03c8 satisfies the\nLaplace equation:\nHt (x, y) = \u2207t \u03c8(x, y),\n\n\u22072t \u03c8(x, y) = 0.\n\n(20)\n\nSimilarly, we can write for the field Et at the D'B boundary in terms of a\npotential \u03c6 as\nEt (x, y) = \u2207t \u03c6(x, y), \u22072t \u03c6(x, y) = 0.\n(21)\nAssuming a localized source, the tangential components of the radiation fields\nare known to decay in the infinity as 1/r and the radial components a 1/r 2\n[35]. Following the argumentation of the Appendix, we must then have Ht =\n0 and Et = 0 at the boundary surface. Thus, under the assumption of\n\n\f6\nlocalized sources the DB' conditions equal the PMC condition (3) and the\nD'B conditions equal the PEC condition (2). However, this is not valid for all\nnon-localized sources. For example, a constant planar surface current gives\nrise to a TEM field with Dz = 0 and Bz = 0 everywhere, whence (16) and\n(17) are satisfied identically. This effect was discussed for the DB boundary\nin [14, 23].\n\n3\n3.1\n\nReflection of plane wave\nPlane-wave relations\n\nThe basic problem associated with the D'B' boundary is to find the reflection\nof a plane wave from the planar boundary z = 0 in the isotropic half space\nz > 0 defined by the parameters \u01eb, \u03bc. Assuming exp(j\u03c9t) time dependence\nand choosing the x axis so that the wave vector of the incident and reflected\nwaves are in the xz plane, the field and wave vectors have the form\ni\n\nHi (r) = Hi e\u2212jk *r ,\n\nEr (r) = Er e\u2212jk *r ,\n\nr\n\nHr (r) = Hr e\u2212jk *r ,\n\n(23)\n\nki = ux kx \u2212 uz kz ,\n\nkr = ux kx + uz kz ,\n\n(24)\n\nEi (r) = Ei e\u2212jk *r ,\n\ni\n\nr\n\n(22)\n\nBecause the fields of a plane wave are divergenceless, they satisfy the orthogonality relations\nki * Ei = 0, ki * Hi = 0,\n(25)\nkr * Er = 0,\n\nkr * Hr = 0.\n\n(26)\n\nAssuming kx 6= 0, i.e., excluding the normal incidence case, the fields can be\nexpressed in terms of their z components as\nEi = (uz + ux kz /kx )Ezi + uy (k/kx )\u03b7Hzi ,\n\n(27)\n\n\u03b7Hi = (uz + ux kz /kx )\u03b7Hzi \u2212 uy (k/kx )Ezi ,\n\n(28)\n\nEr = (uz \u2212 ux kz /kx )Ezr + uy (k/kx )\u03b7Hzr ,\n\n\u03b7Hr = (uz \u2212 ux kz /kx )\u03b7Hzr \u2212 uy (k/kx )Ezr .\nHere,\n\n\u221a\nk = \u03c9 \u03bc\u01eb,\n\n\u03b7=\n\np\n\n\u03bc/\u01eb\n\n(29)\n(30)\n(31)\n\n\f7\ndenote the respective wavenumber and wave-impedance quantities.\nLet us consider an incident plane wave whose z components satisfy the\ncondition\nEzi sin \u03b8 + \u03b7Hzi cos \u03b8 = 0.\n(32)\nActually, any plane wave satisfies a condition of the form (32) for some\nparameter \u03b8. (The TEM case Ezi = 0, Hzi = 0 is excluded because of the\nassumption kx 6= 0.) The special cases of TE and TM waves correspond to\nthe respective cases cos \u03b8 = 0 and sin \u03b8 = 0. From (27), (28) the incident field\nvectors tangential to the boundary can be shown to satisfy the two conditions\nEit sin \u03b8 + \u03b7Hit cos \u03b8 = uy\n\nk\n(\u03b7Hzi sin \u03b8 \u2212 Ezi cos \u03b8),\nkx\n\nEit cos \u03b8 \u2212 \u03b7Hit sin \u03b8 = \u2212ux\n\n3.2\n\nkz\n(\u03b7Hzi sin \u03b8 \u2212 Ezi cos \u03b8).\nkx\n\n(33)\n(34)\n\nDB boundary\n\nThe DB boundary conditions (9) at z = 0 require\nEzr + Ezi = 0,\n\nHzr + Hzi = 0,\n\n(35)\n\nwhence the reflected field components Ezr , Hzr satisfy a relation of the same\nform (32) as the incident field components Ezi , Hzi .\nFrom (29), (30) we see that the tangential components of the reflected\nfield vectors satisfy\nErt sin \u03b8 + \u03b7Hrt cos \u03b8 = \u2212uy\n\nk\n(\u03b7Hzi sin \u03b8 \u2212 Ezi cos \u03b8).\nkx\n\n(36)\n\nCombining this with (33) the condition for the total tangential field at the\nboundary becomes\nEt sin \u03b8 + \u03b7Ht cos \u03b8 = 0,\n(37)\nwhich is of the same form (32) as for the z components of the incident field.\nThis leads us to the following conclusions:\n\u2022 For the TE incident wave with cos \u03b8 = 0, (37) yields Et = 0 which\ncorresponds to the PEC condition (2).\n\u2022 For the TM incident wave with sin \u03b8 = 0, (37) yields Ht = 0 which\ncorresponds to the PMC condition (3).\n\n\f8\n\u2022 Denoting M = tan \u03b8/\u03b7, (37) yields MEt + Ht = 0 which corresponds\nto the PEMC condition (4).\n\n3.3\n\nD'B' boundary\n\nAt the D'B' boundary z = 0 the fields satisfying the conditions (14) yield\n\u2202z (Ezi ejkz z + Ezr e\u2212jkz z )z=0 = jkz (Ezi \u2212 Ezr ) = 0,\n\n(38)\n\n\u2202z (Hzi ejkz z + Hzr e\u2212jkz z )z=0 = jkz (Hzi \u2212 Hzr ) = 0.\n\n(39)\n\nwhence, again, the reflected field components Ezr , Hzr satisfy a relation of the\nsame form (32) as the incident field components Ezi , Hzi .\nFrom (29), (30) we now see that the tangential components of the reflected\nfield vectors satisfy\nErt cos \u03b8 \u2212 \u03b7Hrt sin \u03b8 = \u2212ux\n\nkz\n(\u03b7Hzi sin \u03b8 \u2212 Ezi cos \u03b8).\nkx\n\n(40)\n\nCombining with (34) the condition for the total tangential fields at the boundary becomes\nEt cos \u03b8 \u2212 \u03b7Ht sin \u03b8 = 0.\n(41)\nThis condition leads us to the following conclusions:\n\u2022 For the TE incident wave with cos \u03b8 = 0, (41) yields Ht = 0 which\ncorresponds to the PMC condition (3).\n\u2022 For the TM incident wave with sin \u03b8 = 0, (41) yields Et = 0 which\ncorresponds to the PEC condition (2).\n\u2022 Denoting M \u2032 = \u2212 cot \u03b8/\u03b7, (41) yields M \u2032 Et +Ht = 0 which corresponds\nto the PEMC condition (4).\nSince these properties of the DB and D'B' boundary do not depend on\nthe k vector of the incident plane-wave field (except that kx 6= 0), they are\nvalid for any plane waves. Being linear conditions, they are equally valid for\ngeneral fields which do not have sources at the boundary. It is interesting to\nnotice that the DB and D'B' conditions appear complementary in showing\nPEC and PMC properties to TE and TM polarized fields. Moreover, the two\n\n\f9\nPEMC admittances M and M \u2032 corresponding to the DB and D'B' boundary\nconditions satisfy the simple condition\nMM \u2032 = \u22121/\u03b7 2 .\n\n(42)\n\nThis result has a close connection to the duality transformation [2]\nE \u2192 Ed = j\u03b7H,\n\nH \u2192 Hd = E/j\u03b7,\n\n(43)\n\nwhich induces a transformation of media and boundary conditions. In particular, the DB and D'B' conditions are invariant in the transformation but\nthe PEMC admittance is transformed as M \u2192 Md = \u22121/\u03b7 2 M = M \u2032 .\n\n3.4\n\nDB' and D'B boundaries\n\nLet us finally consider the two other boundary conditions (16) and (17) for\nthe incident plane wave (27), (28) satisfying the condition (32). For the DB'\nboundary the reflected fields satisfy\nEzi + Ezr = 0,\n\nHzi \u2212 Hzr = 0.\n\n(44)\n\nFrom (30) the reflected transverse magnetic field component becomes\n\u03b7Hrt = \u2212ux (kz /kx )\u03b7Hzi + uy (k/kx )Ezi ,\n\n(45)\n\nwhich compared with (28) can be seen to equal \u2212\u03b7Hit . Because this is valid\nfor any \u03b8 DB' boundary condition equals the PMC condition (3) for any fields\nexcept when kx = 0.\nSimilarly, the condition (17) leads to\nEzi \u2212 Ezr = 0,\n\nHzi + Hzr = 0,\n\n(46)\n\nand from (29) to\nErt = \u2212ux (kz /kx )Ezi \u2212 uy (k/kx )\u03b7Hzi ,\n\n(47)\n\nwhich when compared with (27) equals \u2212Eit . This corresponds to the PEC\ncondition (2).\nAs a summary we can compare the four boundary conditions for TE and\nTM polarized incident fields in Table 1.\n\n\f10\nTEz\nDB PEC\nD'B' PMC\nDB' PMC\nD'B PEC\n\nTMz\nPMC\nPEC\nPMC\nPEC\n\nTable 1: Boundary conditions involving normal field components can be\nreplaced by effective PEC and PMC conditions for fields with TE and TM\npolarizations.\n\n3.5\n\nReflection of TEM wave\n\nAt this point one should consider the omitted case kx = 0 corresponding\nto the TEM wave incident normally to the boundary. Since in this case\nthe incident wave does not have normal field components, the preceding\nconditions are already satisfied by the incident field and there appears to\nbe no reflected field. However, since any reflected TEM wave can be added\nto the field, one may conclude that the conditions involving normal field\ncomponents are not enough for defining the TEM fields. This anomaly,\nwhich was already pointed out by Rumsey [15], can be removed by adding\nthe missing information. One may argue that a reflected TEM wave could\nalso be associated to any TE and TM waves but, assuming a passive surface,\nit can be ruled out by power consideration. So the anomaly is associated\nwith TEM waves, only, and we are free to define the reflection coefficient for\nthe TEM wave (it may depend on the polarization of the wave).\nThe additional information comes naturally if the surface is taken as the\nlimiting case of a given physical interface. For example, for the DB boundary studied in terms of its realization by a ZAP-medium interface [14, 23, 32]\nthe reflection of the TEM wave depends on the transverse medium parameters \u01ebt , \u03bct of the medium. For the special case when the wave impedance\nof the TEM wave is equal in both media, there is no reflection. In this case\nwe can define the corresponding DB boundary by requiring no reflection for\nthe TEM wave. Another ZAP medium leads to another definition. Similar consideration for the D'B'-boundary conditions requires a corresponding\nmaterial realization which is yet to be found. For the DB' and D'B boundaries it appears quite natural to assume that the respective PMC and PEC\nconditions are valid for the TEM wave as well.\nFor a localized source giving rise to a continuous spectrum of plane waves,\n\n\f11\nthe normally incident component has zero measure, i.e., it corresponds to zero\nportion of the total radiated power. Thus, the TEM component plays no role\nand can be neglected, as was already pointed out by Rumsey [15]. Also, in\nthe case of a non-planar boundary an incident plane wave has a component\nappearing as a local TEM wave with zero energy which also can be omitted.\nIt was shown through numerical computations for plane-wave scattering from\nspherical and cubic scatterers that there is no back-scattered wave when the\nDB or D'B' conditions are satisfied at the scatterer as predicted by the theory\n[33, 34].\n\n3.6\n\nOther possibilities\n\nFor completeness, the two remaining possible combinations of boundary conditions,\nDz = 0,\n\u2202z Dz = 0,\n(48)\nBz = 0,\n\n\u2202z Bz = 0,\n\n(49)\n\nappear to be of little use. As an example, imposing (48) on the previous\nplane wave yields\nEzi + Ezr = 0,\n\nEzi \u2212 Ezr = 0,\n\n\u21d2\n\nEzi = Ezr = 0.\n\n(50)\n\nThis restricts the freedom of choice of the incident field. Thus, launching a\nTM incident field creates a contradiction, which can be so interpreted that\n(48) is of improper form.\n\n4\n\nMore general boundary surfaces\n\nLet us generalize the previous analysis by replacing the planar boundary\nsurface by one defined by a function x3 (r) as x3 (r) = 0. Defining two other\nfunctions x1 (r) and x2 (r) so that they make a system of orthogonal coordinates satisfying\n\u2207xi (r) * \u2207xj (r) = 0, i 6= j,\n(51)\nallows us to express various differential operators in the form given in Appendix 2.\nExpressing the fields as\nE=\n\n3\nX\ni=1\n\nui Ei ,\n\nH=\n\n3\nX\ni=1\n\nui Hi ,\n\n(52)\n\n\f12\nand similarly for the D and B fields, the DB-boundary conditions are expressed by\nD3 = 0, B3 = 0,\n(53)\nfor x3 = 0. The conditions for the D'B' boundary are somewhat more complicated. Writing the expansion of the divergence\n\u2207 * F = \u2207t * Ft +\n\n1\n\u2202x (h1 h2 F3 ),\nh1 h2 h3 3\n\n(54)\n\nfor the Cartesian coordinates with x3 = z as\n\u2207 * F = \u2207t * Ft + \u2202z Fz ,\n\n(55)\n\ngives us a reason to anticipate that a boundary condition of the form \u2202z Fz = 0\nfor the planar surface should take the form \u2202x3 (h1 h2 F3 ) = 0 for the more\ngeneral surface.\n\n4.1\n\nBoundary conditions\n\nAssuming an isotropic medium bounded by the surface S : x3 = 0, we can\npropose four possible boundary conditions on S involving only the normal\nfield components E3 and H3 and their normal derivatives as\nE3 = 0 and H3 = 0,\n\n(56)\n\nE3 = 0 and \u2202x3 (h1 h2 H3 ) = 0,\n\n(57)\n\n\u2202x3 (h1 h2 E3 ) = 0 and H3 = 0,\n\n(58)\n\n\u2202x3 (h1 h2 E3 ) = 0 and \u2202x3 (h1 h2 H3 ) = 0.\n\n(59)\n\nLet us first consider consequences of these conditions. For E3 = 0 on the\nboundary S one of the Maxwell equations yields\nu3 * (\u2207 \u00d7 H) =\n\n1\n(\u2202x (h2 H2 ) \u2212 \u2202x2 (h1 H1 )) = 0,\nh1 h2 1\n\n(60)\n\nwhile for H3 = 0 the other Maxwell equation yields\nu3 * (\u2207 \u00d7 E) =\n\n1\n(\u2202x (h2 E2 ) \u2212 \u2202x2 (h1 E1 )) = 0.\nh1 h2 1\n\n(61)\n\n\f13\n(60) is satisfied if there exists a scalar function \u03c8(x1 , x2 ) such that on S we\ncan write\n1\nH1 (x1 , x2 ) = \u2202x1 \u03c8(x1 , x2 ),\n(62)\nh1\n1\n(63)\nH2 (x1 , x2 ) = \u2202x2 \u03c8(x1 , x2 ).\nh2\nSimilarly, (61) is satisfied for a function \u03c6(x1 , x2 ) and\nE1 (x1 , x2 ) =\n\n1\n\u2202x \u03c6(x1 , x2 ),\nh1 1\n\n(64)\n\nE2 (x1 , x2 ) =\n\n1\n\u2202x \u03c6(x1 , x2 ),\nh2 2\n\n(65)\n\nas can be easily checked. Thus, (60) and (61) can be compactly expressed in\nvector form as\nE3 = 0\n\n\u21d2\n\nHt (x1 , x2 ) = \u2207t \u03c8(x1 , x2 ),\n\n(66)\n\nH3 = 0,\n\n\u21d2\n\nEt (x1 , x2 ) = \u2207t \u03c6(x1 , x2 ).\n\n(67)\n\nOn the other hand, outside of sources, the divergence of the fields vanishes,\nwhence from (111) we can write\n\u2202x3 (h1 h2 E3 (r)) = 0,\n\n\u21d2\n\n\u2207t * Et (r) = 0,\n\n(68)\n\n\u2202x3 (h1 h2 H3 (r)) = 0,\n\n\u21d2\n\n\u2207t * Ht (r) = 0.\n\n(69)\n\nLet us apply these on the different combinations of boundary conditions (56)\n\u2013 (59).\n\n4.2\n\nDB boundary\n\nStarting from (56) (E3 = 0, H3 = 0) the fields on S can be expressed in\nterms of two potential functions as given in (66), (67). Let us now consider\ntwo special cases. Fields satisfying E3 (r) = 0 everywhere will be called TE3\nfields and fields satisfying H3 (r) = 0 will be called TM3 fields.\nObviously, a TE3 field satisfies \u22023 (h1 h2 E3 ) = 0 everywhere, including the\nboundary surface S. From (67) and (68) we conclude that on S the potential\n\u03c6 satisfies\n\u2207t * Et = \u2207t * (\u2207t \u03c6(x1 , x2 )) = \u22072t \u03c6(x1 , x2 ) = 0.\n(70)\n\n\f14\nFrom the discussion in the Appendix we conclude that this implies\nEt = \u2207t \u03c6(x1 , x2 ) = 0,\n\n(71)\n\ni.e., PEC condition on the boundary surface S. The result can be generalized\nto problems where S is not closed but extends to infinity, provided the sources\nare localized so that the fields vanish in the infinity.\nSimilarly, for the TM3 field the potential \u03c8 must satisfy\n\u22072t \u03c8(x1 , x2 ) = 0\n\n(72)\n\non the surface S, whence the TM3 field sees the boundary defined by the DB\nconditions (56) as a PMC boundary. This condition can also be obtained\nfrom the duality transformation which swaps electric and magnetic fields\nand, hence, PEC and PMC conditions. The DB boundary is invariant to the\nduaity transformation.\nIt must be pointed out that there is no guarantee that a given field can\nbe expressed as a sum of partial fields TE and TM polarized with respect\nto the coordinate function x3 (r) in the general case. Such a decomposition\nis known to be valid with respect to Euclidean coordinates and the radial\nspherical coordinate.\n\n4.3\n\nD'B' boundary\n\nConsidering now the boundary conditions (59), from (68), (69) the fields\nmust satisfy\n\u2207t * Et (x1 , x2 ) = 0, \u2207t * Ht (x1 , x2 ) = 0\n(73)\nat the boundary. From (66) a TE3 field can be represented in terms of a\npotential \u03c8(x1 , x2 ) which from (73) satisfies (72). From (115) we again conclude that a TM3 field sees a D'B' boundary as a PMC boundary. Similarly a\nTM3 field sees the same boundary as a PEC boundary. Thus, in this respect\nDB and D'B' boundaries show complementary properties.\nIt is clear that the D'B' conditions (59) represent a generalization of the\nconditions (14) for boundary surfaces more general than the planar surface.\nComparing (59) and (111) whose last term can be written as \u2207 * (u3 u3 * F),\nwe see that the proper form for the D'B'-boundary conditions is\n\u2207 * (nn * E) = 0,\n\n\u2207 * (nn * H) = 0.\n\n(74)\n\n\f15\nAs an example, for the spherical coordinates x1 = \u03b8, x2 = \u03c6, x3 = r the\nmetric coefficients are\nh1 = h\u03b8 = r,\n\nh2 = h\u03c6 = r sin \u03b8,\n\nh3 = hr = 1,\n\n(75)\n\nand the D'B'-boundary conditions (59) at the surface x3 = r = a have the\nform\n\u2202r (r 2 Er ) = 0,\n\u2202r (r 2 Hr ) = 0\n(76)\ninstead of \u2202r Er = 0, \u2202r Hr = 0 as would be suggested by (14).\n\n4.4\n\nDB' and D'B boundaries\n\nThe mixed conditions (57) and (58) can be handled in the same way. In the\ncase (57), (60) implies Ht = \u2207t \u03c8 on S while (69) implies \u22072t \u03c8 = 0. From\nthe reasoning given in the Appendix we obtain Ht = 0 on S. Thus, (57)\ncorresponds to the PMC conditions for any fields. Similarly, we can show\nthat (58) corresponds to the PEC conditions for any fields.\n\n4.5\n\nThe TF3 field\n\nThe DB and D'B' conditions were tested above for the TE3 and TM3 fields.\nLet us finally consider their generalization in terms of a combined field\nF = sin \u03b8E + cos \u03b8\u03b7H,\n\n(77)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is a parameter. Its component 3 is assumed to satisfy everywhere\nthe condition\nF3 = sin \u03b8E3 + cos \u03b8\u03b7H3 = 0.\n(78)\nAny field satisfying (78) is called a TF3 field. Since \u22023 (h1 h2 F3 ) = 0 everywhere, from (111) the TF3 field satisfies\n\u2207t * Ft = \u2207t * (sin \u03b8Et + cos \u03b8\u03b7Ht ) = 0.\n\n(79)\n\nInserting the Maxwell equations we can expand\nF=\n\n1\n\u2207 \u00d7 (sin \u03b8\u03b7H \u2212 cos \u03b8E),\njk\n\n(80)\n\nwhence the TF3 field satisfies\nu3 * \u2207t \u00d7 (sin \u03b8\u03b7Ht \u2212 cos \u03b8Et ) = 0.\n\n(81)\n\n\f16\nBoth (79) and (81) are valid in source-free regions.\nBecause at the DB boundary Et and Ht are curl-free, (81) is automatically\nvalid. The DB condition (56) implies\nu3 * \u2207t \u00d7 (sin \u03b8Et + cos \u03b8\u03b7Ht ) = 0\n\n(82)\n\nat the boundary. This combined with (79) and the reasoning for a closed\nsurface given in the Appendix leads to\nsin \u03b8Et + cos \u03b8\u03b7Ht = 0\n\n(83)\n\nat the DB boundary. This equals the PEMC condition\nMEt + \u03b7Ht = 0,\n\nM = tan \u03b8/\u03b7.\n\n(84)\n\nFollowing a similar path of reasoning, one can see that at the D'B' boundary (79) is automatically valid for a TF3 field while (81) and\n\u2207t * (sin \u03b8\u03b7Ht \u2212 cos \u03b8Et ) = 0,\n\n(85)\n\nwhich follows from the D'B' conditions (59), correspond to the PEMC condition\nM \u2032 Et + \u03b7Ht = 0,\nM \u2032 = \u2212 cot \u03b8/\u03b7.\n(86)\n\nAs a conclusion, for a TF3 field, which is a generalization of the TE3 and\nTM3 fields, both DB and D'B' boundaries appear as PEMC boundaries with\nthe respective admittances M and M \u2032 . This includes as special cases the\nresults for the TE3 and TM3 fields given above.\n\n5\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe four boundary conditions (56) \u2013 (59) involving only field components\nnormal to the boundary surface and their normal derivatives, form an interesting set. Two of these, (57) and (58) are alternatives for the respective\nPMC and PEC conditions which in terms of tangential fields are normally\ntaken in the form (3) and (2). The other two conditions, dubbed as DB and\nD'B' conditions, (56), (59), appear new as kind of mixtures of PEC and PMC\nconditions or variants of the PEMC condition. The DB conditions have been\nintroduced already in 1959 [15] but have not been applied for half a century; the D'B' conditions have not been discussed earlier to the knowledge\n\n\f17\nof these authors. Since their representations are so basic, DB and D'B' conditions seem to have their right of existence along with the PEC and PMC\nconditions.\nIn introducing new boundary conditions the first question is to find their\nproperties for the electromagnetic fields. This has been done here and in\nsome of the previous publications. The next step would be to ponder about\ntheir possible applications. In case there are some of enough interest, the\nproblem of practical realization of such boundary surfaces as an interface\nof some material comes up. As explained in the introduction, the planar\nDB boundary may have some application as an isotropic soft surface. Also,\nas shown in [9, 10], the DB conditions play a central role in the theory of\nelectromagnetic cloaking. The DB boundary can be realized, e.g., by an\ninterface of a uniaxial anisotropic medium with zero axial parameters (ZAP\nmedium) or another medium called the uniaxial IB medium [13, 23]. Finding\na realization for the D'B' medium is still an open problem.\nIn [34] it has been shown that both DB and D'B' boundaries are self dual\nwhich implies that scatterers symmetric in \u03c0/2 rotation have no backscattering. This is an interesting property, shown to be valid by numerical computations, and it may have potential applications. As a continuation of the\npresent study, it has been further shown that it is possible to define a generalized DB boundary conditions of which the DB and D'B' conditions are\nspecial cases. Such boundaries are also self dual and have no backscattering\n[32].\nIn addition to the interesting physical properties of the novel boundary\nconditions, there may be some advantage in numerical electromagnetics by\nconsidering normal field components on the surface instead of the tangential\ncomponents in the cases of DB' and D'B boundaries which correspond to the\nrespective PMC and PEC conditions for the tangential fields.\n\nAppendix 1: Fields in uniaxial IB medium\nA medium called uniaxial IB medium has been defined in [13] by conditions\nof the form\nD = aBt + buz Bz + euz \u00d7 E,\n(87)\nH = muz \u00d7 B + cEt + duz Ez ,\n\n(88)\n\nin terms of six parameters a, b, c, d, e, m. Let us briefly consider fields in\nsuch a medium. Inserting (87) and (88) in the second one of the source-free\n\n\f18\nMaxwell equations\n\u2207 \u00d7 E = \u2212j\u03c9B,\n\n(89)\n\n\u2207 \u00d7 H = j\u03c9D,\n\n(90)\n\nwe can split both of them in two components.

The transverse components of (89) and (90)\ncan be written as\n\u2202z uz \u00d7 Et + j\u03c9Bt = uz \u00d7 \u2207t Ez ,\n(94)\n(c\u2202z \u2212 j\u03c9e)uz \u00d7 Et \u2212 (m\u2202z + j\u03c9a)Bt = duz \u00d7 \u2207t Ez .\n\n(95)\n\nTaking the divergence of (94) and (95) yields\n\u2202z uz * \u2207t \u00d7 Et = j\u03c9\u2207t * Bt ,\n\n(96)\n\n(c\u2202z \u2212 j\u03c9e)uz * \u2207t \u00d7 Et = \u2212(m\u2202z + j\u03c9a)\u2207t * Bt .\n\n(97)\n\nThe three equations (93), (96) and (97) can now be reduced as follows.\nFirst we eliminate the term uz * \u2207t \u00d7 Et leaving us with the two equations\n[m\u2202z + j\u03c9(b + c)]\u2207t * Bt = 0,\n\n(98)\n\n[mb\u2202z + j\u03c9(me + a(b + c))]\u2207t * Bt = 0.\n\n(99)\n\nAs a second step we eliminate \u2202t (\u2207t * Bt ) and arrive at the single equation\n[(b + c)(b \u2212 a) \u2212 me]\u2207t * Bt = 0.\n\n(100)\n\nOmitting the special case when the factor in brackets vanishes which corresponds to a certain subset of the medium, we conclude that the transverse\nB vector must be divergenceless,\n\u2207t * Bt = 0.\n\n(101)\n\n\f19\nFrom (93) it then follows that the E vector must satisfy\nuz * \u2207t \u00d7 Et = 0\n\n(102)\n\neverywhere in the medium. Here we have also assumed that b+c 6= 0. Finally,\nfrom (91) and (87) we obtain conditions for the axial field components,\nBz = 0,\n\nDz = 0.\n\n(103)\n\nTo conclude, we have shown that any field in the uniaxial IB medium,\ndefined by the medium equations (87), (88) in their general form, must satisfy\nthe conditions (103). Thus, if we cut a layer, however thin, of the medium\nwith two planes orthogonal to the z axis, the fields on both sides of the slab\nmust satisfy the DB-boundary conditions (5) with n = uz .\n\nAppendix 2: Orthogonal coordinates\nThe following review of differential operators for orthogonal coordinates defined by three functions x1 (r), x2 (r) and x3 (r) has been taken from [35, 36].\nThe boundary surface S is defined by x3 (r) = 0. In this case, x1 (r) and\nx2 (r) define orthogonal coordinates on S. The coordinate unit vectors can\nbe represented as\nui = hi \u2207xi (r),\n\nhi = (\u2207xi (r) * \u2207xi (r))\u22121/2 ,\n\n(104)\n\nwhere the hi = hi (r) are the metric-coefficient functions. These follow from\nthe definition of the gradient,\n\u2207f (r) =\n\n3\nX\nui\ni=1\n\nhi\n\n\u2202xi f (r).\n\n(105)\n\nThe divergence and curl of a vector function\nF(r) =\n\n3\nX\n\nui Fi (r)\n\n(106)\n\ni=1\n\nare defined by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3\nh1 h2 h3\n1 X\n\u2202x\n\u2207*F =\nFi ,\nh1 h2 h3 i=1 i\nhi\n\n(107)\n\n\f20\n\u2207\u00d7F=\n\nu1\n(\u2202x (h3 F3 ) \u2212 \u2202x3 (h2 F2 ))\nh2 h3 2\n\nu2\n(\u2202x (h1 F1 ) \u2212 \u2202x1 (h3 F3 ))\nh3 h1 3\nu3\n(\u2202x (h2 F2 ) \u2212 \u2202x2 (h1 F1 )),\n+\nh1 h2 1\n+\n\n(108)\n\nand the Laplacian by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3\nh1 h2 h3\n1 X\n\u2202x\n\u2202xi f .\n\u2207 f = \u2207 * (\u2207f ) =\nh1 h2 h3 i=1 i\nh2i\n2\n\n(109)\n\nThe differential operations can be split in parts along the special coordinate x3 and transverse to it:\n\u2207f = \u2207t f +\n\u2207 * F = \u2207t * Ft +\n\nu3\n\u22023 f,\nh3\n\n(110)\n\n1\n\u2202x (h1 h2 F3 ),\nh1 h2 h3 3\n\nu3\n(\u2202x (h2 F2 ) \u2212 \u2202x2 (h1 F1 )).\nh1 h2 1\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nh1 h2\n2\n2\n\u2207 f = \u2207t f +\n\u2202x\n\u2202x3 f .\nh1 h2 h3 3\nh3\n\n\u2207 \u00d7 F = (\u2207 \u00d7 F)t +\n\n(111)\n(112)\n(113)\n\nIf a scalar function \u03c6(x1 , x2 ) satisfies on the surface S : x3 = 0 the Laplace\nequation\n\u22072t \u03c6(x1 , x2 ) = 0,\n(114)\nand if the surface is closed, we can expand the surface integral as\nZ\nZ\nZ\n2\n\u2217\n|\u2207t \u03c6| dS = \u2207t * (\u03c6 \u2207t \u03c6)dS \u2212 \u03c6\u2217 \u22072t \u03c6dS.\nS\n\nS\n\n(115)\n\nS\n\nBoth integrals on the right-hand side vanish. The last one because (114) and\nthe middle one because the surface is closed. Thus, we can conclude that\n\u2207t \u03c6 = 0 on S. This elementary proof is, however, valid for simply connected\nsurfaces only, and requires a more involved analysis for more complicated\nsurfaces like the torus, see [19, 20].\n\n\f21\nThis condition remains valid for an open surface S extending to infinity\nwhen the integral over the boundary contour C of S in infinity,\nZ\nI\n\u2217\n\u2207t * (\u03c6 \u2207t \u03c6)dS = m * (\u03c6\u2217 \u2207t \u03c6)dC,\n(116)\nS\n\nC\n\nvanishes. Here m is the unit vector normal to the contour and parallel to the\nsurface in infinity. For a planar surface z = 0 we have m = u\u03c1 , the radial\nunit vector. As an example, if \u2207t \u03c6 is the tangential component of the electric\nfield from a localized source, on the contour integral m * \u2207t \u03c6 corresponds to\nthe radial component of the far field which is known to decay as 1/\u03c12 along\nthe plane. Since dC = \u03c1d\u03c6, the integral vanishes and \u2207t \u03c6 = 0 on the plane\nwhich corresponds to the PEC condition. Hovever, this is not necessarily\nthe case when the source extends to infinity. For example, for the normally\nincident TEM plane wave with constant Et we have \u03c6 = Et * \u03c1, whence the\nintegral (116) becomes infinite. A more complete analysis of the open surface\ncase remains still to be done.\n\nAcknowledgment\nThis work has been partly supported by the Academy of Finland. Discussions\nwith Professor P.-S.
