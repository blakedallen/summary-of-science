By \"fluctuations\" we mean in general the correlations in\nthe gluon distribution of an energetic hadron (the target in DIS) which are generated\nthrough the radiative processes contributing to its evolution with increasing energy. More\nprecisely, we shall be interested here in the gluon\u2013number fluctuations, which have been\nrecently shown [1\u20134] to play an essential role in the evolution of the elastic S\u2013matrix for\ndipole\u2013hadron scattering towards the unitarity limit. The \"dipole\" is a quark\u2013antiquark\npair in a colorless state, so like the q q\u0304 excitation through which the virtual photon couples\nto the hadronic target in DIS. As demonstrated in Refs. [2\u20134], both the energy dependence of the characteristic scale for the onset of unitarization - the target saturation\nmomentum Qs - and the functional form of the scattering amplitudes at high energy,\nare strongly modified, and to a large extent even determined, by such fluctuations. Motivated by these observations, and by the importance played by dipole configurations for\nthe DIS processes at high energy, we shall provide a detailed analysis of the influence\nof gluon number fluctuations on the inclusive and diffractive DIS cross\u2013sections. As we\nshall discover, the effects of fluctuations are in fact overwhelming: For sufficiently high\nenergy, and within a wide kinematical range around the (average) saturation momentum,\nthey wash out the corresponding predictions of the mean field approximation, and replace\nthem with a new kind of universal behaviour, which is relatively simple.\nA priori, one may expect the gluon\u2013number fluctuations not to be important for the\nproblem of the high\u2013energy evolution, since the latter is characterized by a high\u2013density\nenvironment (especially in the saturation regime at transverse momenta below Qs ), where\nthe gluon occupation numbers are large. And as a matter of facts, such fluctuations have\nbeen left out by the modern approaches to non\u2013linear evolution in QCD, namely, the\nBalitsky equations for the eikonal scattering amplitudes [5] and the (functional) JIMWLK\nequation [6\u20138] for the evolution of the 'color glass condensate' [8, 9]. These formalisms do\ninclude non\u2013trivial correlations - as obvious from the fact that they generate infinite\nhierarchies of equations -, but these are purely color correlations (like the exchange of\na single gluon between two dipole amplitudes), and as such they die away when Nc \u2192 \u221e\n(with Nc the number of colors). In this limit, the Balitsky\u2013JIMWLK hierarchy reduces to\na single non\u2013linear equation 3 - the Balitsky\u2013Kovchegov (BK) equation [5, 10] -, which\nis often referred to as the mean field approximation (MFA). But in so far as the gluon\u2013\nnumber fluctuations of interest here are concerned, the Balitsky\u2013JIMWLK formalism as\na whole is a kind of MFA - the generalization of the BK equation to finite Nc .\nAnticipated by early studies [11] (mostly numerical) within Mueller's \"color dipole picture\" [12], the importance of the gluon\u2013number fluctuations for the high\u2013energy evolution\nin QCD has been fully appreciated only recently, over the last couple of years [1\u20134]. Rare\nfluctuations associated with gluon splitting have been shown to control the formation of\n3\n\nMore precisely, they reduce to a simplified hierarchy which is equivalent to the BK equation\nfor uncorrelated initial conditions, and which does not generate new correlations in the course\nof the evolution; see the discussion in Ref. [4].\n\n3\n\n\fhigher\u2013point correlations in the dilute tail of the gluon distribution at relatively large\ntransverse momenta (above Qs ). Once initiated through fluctuations, such correlations\nare rapidly amplified by the BFKL evolution [13], and then play a crucial role in the\ngrowth of the gluon distribution and its eventual saturation: they are at the origin of the\nsaturation and unitarization effects included in the Balitsky\u2013JIMWLK equations. Thus,\nwhile they are correctly describing the role of the higher\u2013point correlations in providing\nsaturation, the Balitsky\u2013JIMWLK equations fail to also include the physical source for\nsuch correlations, namely, the gluon\u2013number fluctuations in the dilute regime.\nSoon after this failure has been first realized [4], new equations have been proposed [4, 14,\n15] which correct the Balitsky\u2013JIMWLK hierarchy by including the proper source terms\n(the relevant fluctuations) within the limits of the large\u2013Nc approximation. The latter\nis necessary since the dynamics leading to fluctuations in the dilute tail is described in\nthe framework of the dipole picture [12, 16]. There is currently an intense, ongoing, effort\naiming at generalizing these equations to finite Nc [17\u201324], but in spite of some interesting\ndiscoveries - like the recognition [18, 25] of a powerful self\u2013duality of the high\u2013energy\nevolution, and the construction of an effective Hamiltonian which is explicitly self\u2013dual\n[20, 23] -, the general evolution equations valid for arbitrary Nc are not yet known. This\nis the main reason for our restriction to the large\u2013Nc approximation in what follows.\nThe new equations in Refs. [4, 14] form an infinite hierarchy for the N\u2013dipole amplitudes\nhT (N ) i with N \u2265 1 which describe the scattering between a system of N color dipoles\nand an energetic hadronic target. For reasons to be briefly mentioned in Sect. 2.1, we\nshall refer to these equations as the 'Pomeron loop equations'. They are currently under\nactive investigation [25\u201332], and although their general solutions are not known, a lot\nof information is already available about their asymptotic behaviour at high energy, via\nthe correspondence [3, 4, 33] between high\u2013energy QCD and statistical physics (see the\ndiscussion below and also Sect. 3 for more details). This is the information that we shall\nuse in our analysis of deep inelastic scattering throughout this paper.\nPrevious studies of DIS at high energy, or small \"Bjorken\u2013x\" [34\u201354] (see also the review papers [55\u201357]), have shown that diffractive DIS represents a privileged framework\nto study both gluon saturation - since the diffractive cross\u2013section \u03c3diff appears to be\ndominated by relatively large q q\u0304 configurations, with size r \u223c 1/Qs (Qs is the target saturation momentum, and increases with the energy as Q2s (x) \u223c 1/x\u03bb ) - and fluctuations -\nsince, as known since long [58, 59], the inelastic part of \u03c3diff is a measure of the dispersion\nof the virtual photon wavefunction over its various Fock space components (like q q\u0304, q q\u0304g,\netc.). Note, however, that the \"fluctuations\" which appear in the standard discussion of\ndiffraction [58, 59] refer to the wavefunction of the projectile - in DIS, the virtual photon\nand its various hadronic excitations -, and not to that of the target (the proton, or more\ngenerally some hadron h). In such previous studies, the target has always been treated in\nthe spirit of the mean field approximation, like an optical potential or some fixed gluon distribution, off which scatter the partonic components of the projectile. However, our main\nemphasis here will be precisely on the gluon\u2013number fluctuations in the target wavefunction, which are the relevant fluctuations for a study of the high\u2013energy limit, and which\ninfluence all the DIS observables, and not only those associated with diffraction. Indeed,\nas we shall see in Sect. 2, the calculation of both inclusive and diffractive cross\u2013sections\n\n4\n\n\f2\n\n2\n\nY= ln (1/x)\n\nQs\nsaturation\n(CGC)\n\nQd\n\ndiffusive\nscaling\n\nYDS\ngeometric\nscaling\n\nL\n\nYform\n\nBFKL\nDGLAP\n\n2\n\n\u039b QCD\n\n2\n\n\u03c1 = ln (Q / Q0 )\n\n2\n\nFig. 1. \"Phases\" of the hadronic wavefunction in the kinematical plane Y \u2013 ln(Q2 /Q20 ). When\nY . YDS the gluon distribution scales with momentum in a 'geometric' way, i.e. it is a function\n\u221a of\nQ2 /Q2s . When Y & YDS it scales in a 'diffusive' way, i.e. it becomes a function of ln(Q2 /Q2s )/ Y .\n\nin DIS at high energy and large Nc naturally involves the amplitudes for dipole\u2013target\nscattering, as determined by the Pomeron loop equations alluded to above.\nLet us clarify here what we shall mean by the 'high\u2013energy regime of DIS' in what follows.\nThis is the regime where, when increasing the energy (or decreasing x), the resolution scale\nQ2 of the virtual photon is simultaneously increased (although not as fast as the total\nenergy, of course !), in such a way that Q2 remains comparable, or even larger, than the\ntarget saturation momentum Q2s (x). Indeed, the strict high\u2013energy limit, in which the\nenergy is increased at a fixed value for Q2 (and for a fixed impact parameter b), is less\ninteresting, since conceptually clear: for sufficiently high energy, the cross\u2013section reaches\nits unitarity (or 'black disk') limit, in which the projectile is completely absorbed by the\ntarget. (This behaviour will be manifest in the theoretical formalism that we shall use,\nwhich preserves unitarity.) On the other hand, the behaviour at relatively large Q2 , such\nthat Q2 \u226b Q2s (x), is considerably more interesting, since in that region the scattering is\nweak, yet - as we shall discover - it is strongly influenced by the physics of saturation,\nwithin a large window in Q2 whose width is increasing with 1/x. Moreover, with increasing\nenergy, the effects of fluctuations in the evolution of the target gluon distribution become\nmore and more pronounced, and the interplay between fluctuations and saturation leads\n2\nto a rich structure in DIS at high energy and Q2 >\n\u223c Qs (x), that we now explain.\nTo that aim, let us refer to Fig. 1, which represents the kinematical plane Y \u2013 \u03c1 (with\nY \u2261 ln(1/x) and \u03c1 \u2261 ln(Q2 /Q20 ), where Q20 is a fixed reference scale) for DIS scattering,\nand also the physical phase\u2013space for the QCD evolution of the hadronic target. Within\nthe latter interpretation, Y is the target rapidity and Q2 can be assimilated to either\nthe transverse momentum of a gluon inside the target (k\u22a5 \u223c Q), or the transverse size\n5\n\n\fof a dipole within the projectile (r \u223c 1/Q). The straight line denoted as \"Q2s \" in Fig. 1\nrepresents the average saturation line in the target: h\u03c1s iY \u2261 ln(hQ2s i/Q20 ) \u2243 \u03bbY , with \u03bb\nthe 'saturation exponent'. This is an 'average' since, in the presence of fluctuations, the\nsaturation momentum becomes a random quantity: the stochastic evolution of the target\ngives rise to a statistical ensemble of gluon configurations, and the value of Q2s can vary\nfrom one configuration to another. The dispersion \u03c3 2 \u2261 h\u03c12s i \u2212 h\u03c1s i2 which characterizes\nthis variation will play a fundamental role in what follows. This stochastic process turns\nout to be a random walk in \u03c1s \u2261 ln(Q2s /Q20 ), hence the dispersion rises linearly with Y\n[3] : \u03c3 2 (Y ) \u2243 Dfr Y , with Dfr the 'front diffusion coefficient' (see Sect. 3). The second line\nin Fig. 1, denoted as \"Q2d \", will be shortly explained.\nThe most interesting region for us here is the scaling window in between these two lines.\nAt lower values of Q2 , to the left of the saturation line, the gluons form a color glass condensate with large occupation numbers \u223c 1/\u03b1s , the dipole amplitude reaches the unitarity\nlimit hT i = 1, and the mean field description is well justified. At much larger Q2 , on the\nright of the scaling region, one finds the standard perturbative regime, where the gluon\nsystem is very dilute, the dipole amplitude shows 'color transparency', hT (r)i \u221d r 2 , and\nneither saturation, nor fluctuations, do play any role. But in the scaling region at intermediate Q2 , the gluon occupation numbers are relatively low and the scattering is weak,\nhT i \u226a 1, yet the dynamics is generally influenced by both saturation and fluctuations, in\nproportions which depend upon the actual value of Y .\nThe crucial scale for the present discussion is the rapidity YDS which separates between\nan intermediate energy regime at Y < YDS , where \u03c3 2 \u226a 1 and the mean\u2013field picture\nroughly applies (with some important limitations, though, as we shall discuss in Sect. 3),\nand a high\u2013energy regime at Y > YDS , where \u03c3 2 \u226b 1 and the target expectation values\nare dominated by rare fluctuations up to very large values of \u03c1. (Parametric estimates for\nYDS and the other scales which appear in Fig. 1 will be given in Sect. 3.)\nSpecifically, the lower part of the scaling region at Y < YDS is the window for geometric\nscaling [33, 60\u201363]. In that region, the dipole amplitude and the gluon occupation number\n'scale' as functions of the dimensionless variable Q2 /hQ2s i; e.g.,\nhT (r)iY \u2248 (r 2 hQ2s i)\u03b30 \u2261 exp[\u2212\u03b30 (\u03c1 \u2212 h\u03c1s i)],\n\nwith\n\n\u03b30 \u2243 0.63 .\n\n(1.1)\n\nThis behaviour is particularly interesting as it may explain a similar scaling observed in\n2\nthe HERA data for DIS at x \u2264 0.01 and up to rather large Q2 (Q2 <\n\u223c 400 GeV ) [60].\n\nBut in the high\u2013energy regime at Y > YDS , the geometric scaling is progressively washed\nout by fluctuations [2] and eventually replaced (when Y \u226b YDS ) by a new type of scaling\n[3, 4], for which we propose the name of diffusive scaling : the dipole amplitude scales as a\nfunction of the dimensionless variable (\u03c1 \u2212 h\u03c1s i)/\u03c3. This scaling extends up to very large\nvalues of \u03c1, namely, it holds so long as \u03c1 \u2212 h\u03c1s i \u226a \u03c3 2 . The borderline of this domain at\n\u03c1d (Y ) \u2261 h\u03c1s i + \u03c3 2 \u2243 (\u03bb + Dfr )Y represents the upper part of the line \"Q2d \" in Fig. 1. The\nfunctional form of the dipole amplitude is known within this entire domain [4] (see Sect.\n3). In particular, deeply within the scaling window in Fig. 1, this is roughly a Gaussian:\n\u03c3\n(\u03c1 \u2212 h\u03c1s i)2\nhT (\u03c1)iY \u2248\nexp \u2212\n\u03c1 \u2212 h\u03c1s i\n\u03c32\n(\n\n)\n\n6\n\nfor\n\n\u03c3 \u226a \u03c1 \u2212 h\u03c1s i \u226a \u03c3 2 .\n\n(1.2)\n\n\fThe physics behind this asymptotic form is remarkably simple and universal (i.e., insensitive to both the initial condition at low energy and the details of the evolution with\nincreasing energy). It relies on just two basic facts: (i) saturation exists - meaning that,\nin the event\u2013by\u2013event description, T (\u03c1) = 1 for \u03c1 smaller than some \u03c1s , and (ii) the\nsaturation scale \u03c1s is a random variable distributed according to a Gaussian law, with\nexpectation value h\u03c1s i and dispersion \u03c3 2 which both increase linearly with Y . Then, the\nscaling behaviour and the Gaussian shape manifest in Eq. (1.2) are a direct reflection\nof the corresponding properties of the probability distribution for \u03c1s . These properties\ntransmit so directly from the probability law to the average amplitude since, within the\nrange indicated in Eq. (1.2), the expectation value hT (\u03c1)i is small, hT (\u03c1)i \u226a 1, yet it is\ndominated by gluon configurations which are at saturation at the scale \u03c1 of interest (i.e.,\nfor which \u03c1s >\n\u223c \u03c1 \u226b h\u03c1s i, and thus T = 1) : Indeed, although relatively rare, such configurations yield contributions of order one, whereas the respective contributions of the\ntypical configurations, for which \u03c1s \u223c h\u03c1s i, are exponentially suppressed (cf. Eq. (1.1)).\nWe thus arrive at the important conclusion that, even though the scattering is weak on\nthe average, meaning that the target looks typically dilute when probed on the scale r \u223c\n1/Q, the average amplitude is nevertheless controlled by \"black spots\" within the target\nwavefunction, i.e., by rare fluctuations with unusually large gluon density. At sufficiently\nhigh energy and up to extremely large values of Q2 (much larger than hQ2s i), the physical\nquantities are dominated by saturated gluon configurations. This conclusion will be further\nsubstantiated by our analysis of the DIS cross\u2013sections at high energy.\nSpecifically, by using estimates like that in Eq. (1.2) for the dipole amplitudes hT (N ) i\n(the general formulae of this type will be presented in Sect. 3), together with appropriate,\n'dipole', factorization fomualae for the inclusive and the diffractive DIS cross\u2013sections\n(that we shall discuss in Sect. 2), we shall analytically compute in Sect. 4 the dominant\nbehaviour of the respective cross\u2013sections in the high\u2013energy regime - by which we shall\nmore precisely mean the diffusive scaling regime at \u03c3 2 \u226b 1 and \u03c1 \u2212 h\u03c1s i \u226a \u03c3 2 (see Fig.\n1). The main conclusion of this analysis can be concisely formulated as follows: All the\nphysical properties (like the diffusive scaling or the Gaussian decrease in Eq. (1.2)) that\nhave been previously noticed at the level of the dipole amplitudes translate literally to\nthe DIS cross\u2013sections. This is so since, as we shall demonstrate in Sect. 4, the various\nconvolutions which relate the DIS cross\u2013sections to the dipole amplitudes - namely,\nthe convolutions with the BFKL kernel which enter the high\u2013energy evolution of the\nprojectile, and those with the wavefunction of the virtual photon - are dominated by\nsmall dipole sizes r \u223c 1/Q (within the kinematic regime of interest here).\nThis last point is perhaps surprising, especially in relation with the diffractive sector,\nwhere the cross\u2013section at large Q2 (Q2 \u226b Q2s ) was known to be dominated by relatively\nlarge dipoles, with r \u223c 1/Qs [34, 35, 40, 68]. This standard picture is correct indeed, but\nat high energy it applies only in the event\u2013by\u2013event description, and not also on the\naverage. Indeed, even for Q2 \u226b hQ2s i, the statistical ensemble representing the target\ndoes still contain gluon configurations ('black spots') for which Q2s \u223c Q2 ; although rare,\nsuch configurations will dominate the (inclusive and diffractive) cross\u2013sections, because\nthe photon wavefunction strongly favors the small dipole sizes r \u223c 1/Q.\nAnother surprise of our analysis is that, in the whole 'high\u2013energy regime' defined as above\n\n7\n\n\f- i.e., up to rather large values of Q2 , such that Q2 \u226b hQ2s i -, the diffractive cross\u2013\nsection is dominated by its elastic component, that is, by the elastic scattering between\nthe onium as a whole and the hadronic target. (The 'onium' represents the wavefunction of\nthe projectile at the time of scattering, as produced via the BFKL evolution of the original\n2\nq q\u0304 pair; see Sect. 2 for details.) Whereas expected in the 'black disk' regime at Q2 <\n\u223c hQs i\n[56, 58, 59], this property may look surprising in the high\u2013Q2 regime at Q2 \u226b hQ2s i (e.g.,\nit contradicts the corresponding expectations of the MFA [40, 47, 50]), but it is in fact\nnatural in view of our present wisdom: even for such high values of Q2 , the cross\u2013section\nis dominated by 'black spots' which are already in the 'black disk' regime.\nThe dominance of the elastic scattering has interesting consequences for the dependence\nof the diffractive cross\u2013section upon the rapidity gap Ygap : in the high\u2013energy regime,\nthe differential cross\u2013section per unit rapidity gap is strongly peaked near Ygap = Y .\nAlternatively - and this is the language that we shall prefer in this paper - the cross\u2013\nmin\nsection integrated over all the values of the rapidity gap Ygap from a minimal value Ygap\nmin\nup to Y is independent of the lower limit Ygap\n, so long as the latter is not too close to Y .\nThis second language will be more convenient for us here since the approximations that we\nshall employ - a \"leading logarithmic approximation\" with respect to ln(1/\u03b2) \u2261 Y \u2212Ygap\n- will allow us to compute the integrated cross\u2013section, but not also to control the details\nof the differential cross\u2013section near \u03b2 = 1.\nLet us mention here some limitations of our approach (besides the high\u2013energy and large\u2013\nNc approximations already discussed). We shall not be able to describe the impact parameter dependence of the scattering amplitudes; that is, we shall follow their evolution with increasing Y at a fixed impact parameter b. There are two reasons for that:\nFirst, the asymptotic solutions to the Pomeron loop equations are known only after a\n'coarse\u2013graining' in impact parameter space, which eliminates the dependence upon b [4].\nSecond, more generally, we do not expect perturbation theory to properly describe the\nb\u2013dependence of the scattering amplitudes, especially near the edge of the hadron, where\nthe gluon density is low and the dynamics is sensitive to confinement. Because of that, in\nperturbation theory one can study the 'blackening' of the hadron disk, but not also the\nradial expansion of the 'black disk', i.e., the problem of the Froissart bound [64, 65].\nFurthermore, in our study of diffraction, we shall not be able to describe processes with\narbitrary large diffractive mass MX , or arbitrary small values of \u03b2 (see kinematics in Fig.\n2). Indeed, the formalism for diffraction that we shall develop in Sect. 2 can accommodate\nsaturation effects in the wavefunction of the target (the hadron), but not also in that of\nthe projectile (the virtual photon). This implies an upper limit on the rapidity ln(1/\u03b2) of\nthe projectile, which is however parametrically large: ln(1/\u03b2) \u226a (1/\u1fb1s ) ln(1/\u03b1s2). Hence,\nin the case of diffraction, the 'high\u2013energy limit' that we shall consider is the limit in\nwhich the total rapidity Y and the rapidity gap Ygap can be arbitrarily large, but such\nthat their difference Y \u2212Ygap = ln(1/\u03b2) remains finite and constrained as indicated above.\nThis paper is organized as follows: In the first half of it, which covers Sects. 2 and 3, we\nshall develop the formalism which is required for a calculation of the DIS cross\u2013sections\nin the high\u2013energy regime and for large Nc , and in the second half (i.e., Sect. 4), we shall\nexplicitly compute these cross\u2013sections, and compare to the respective mean\u2013field results.\n\n8\n\n\fSpecifically, in Sect. 2 we shall develop a factorization scheme for the diffractive dipole\u2013\nhadron scattering at high energy (the 'dipole' being, of course, the q q\u0304 pair produced\nvia the dissociation of the virtual photon in DIS). Our final formula turns out to be an\ninteresting combination between the 'color dipole picture' by Mueller [12] and an early\nformula for hadron\u2013hadron diffraction by Good and Walker [58]: Within the frame in\nmin\nwhich the target rapidity coincides with the minimal rapidity gap Ygap\n, the projectile\nis described as an onium - a collection of dipoles produced via the BFKL evolution\nmin\nof the original q q\u0304 pair over a rapidity interval Y \u2212 Ygap\n-, and the diffractive cross\u2013\nsection is expressed as the onium expectation value of the elastic cross\u2013sections for all the\ndipole configurations within the onium. Whereas the emergence of such a formula is not\nunexpected (as the dipoles fulfill the main requirement of the analysis in Ref. [58], namely,\nthey are eigenstates of the S\u2013matrix operator), our explicit derivation has the merit to\nclarify the importance of properly choosing the Lorentz frame in order for this formula\nto be valid. The relation to previous approaches [36, 46, 50], in particular to a non\u2013linear\nevolution equation proposed by Kovchegov and Levin [44], will be also discussed.\nThe aforementioned factorization formula involves the average dipole amplitudes hT (N ) i\nevaluated at the target rapidity Ygap , which in our formalism can be arbitrarily large. In\nSect. 3 we shall describe the calculation of these amplitudes in the high\u2013energy regime,\nwith the purpose of justifying expressions like Eq. (1.2) and completing the physical\npicture developed before, in relation with Fig. 1. The presentation in Sect. 3 is based on\nrecent developments in Refs. [3, 14], but it also contains some new elements and conceptual\nclarifications, like a parametric estimate for YDS , the concept of diffusive scaling, and the\nrecognition of an interesting 'rigidity' property for the average dipole amplitude in the\npresence of fluctuations.\nSect. 4 is our main section, in which we establish the dominant behaviour of the DIS cross\u2013\nsections in the high\u2013energy regime. Remarkably, it turns out that this behaviour can be\ncomputed from the scattering amplitude hT (r)iY for a single dipole - the original q q\u0304\nfluctuation of the virtual photon. This is a priori clear for the inclusive cross\u2013section, but\nit is true for the diffractive one (at high energy), because of the dominance of the elastic\nscattering, as aforementioned. Our calculation will be organized as follows: First, we shall\nconsider the q q\u0304 component alone and compute the respective contributions to \u03c3tot and\n\u03c3diff . Then, we consider the additional contributions associated with the q q\u0304g component\nand demonstrate that, in the regime of diffusive scaling, the inelastic contribution is\nparametrically suppressed as compared to the elastic one. To better emphasize the effects\nof fluctuations, we shall compare our results to the corresponding predictions of the MFA.\nSect. 5 summarizes our results and presents our conclusions and some perspectives.\n\n2\n\nA dipole picture for deep inelastic scattering at high energy\n\nAs explained in the Introduction, we would like to provide a theoretical description for\ndiffractive deep inelastic scattering at high energy and in the multi\u2013color limit Nc \u2192 \u221e.\nBy 'diffractive events' we shall understand the DIS events \u03b3 \u2217 h \u2192 Xp which contain an\nelastically scattered hadron h in their final state together with a 'diffractive hadronic\n9\n\n\fQ2\n\n)\n\nx\u2261\n\nMX\n\nQ2\n,\nQ2 +W 2\n\nY = ln(1/x),\n\nYgap\n\n\u03b2\u2261\n\nQ2\n2 ,\nQ2 +MX\n\nxP =\n\nx\n\u03b2\n\nYgap = ln(1/xP )\n\nY \u2212 Ygap = ln(1/\u03b2)\n\nFig. 2.

(We use\nhere standard notations in the context of DIS, as summarized in Fig. 2. See, e.g., Refs.\n[55, 56] for review papers on the phenomenology of diffraction and more details about the\nkinematics.) In the high energy regime at W 2 \u226b Q2 , MX2 , the existence of a gap Ygap \u2243\nln[W 2 /(Q2 + MX2 )] follows automatically from the condition that the proton undergoes\nelastic scattering together with the relevant kinematics. We shall be mainly interested here\nin the high\u2013energy limit, defined as the limit W 2 \u2192 \u221e at fixed values for Q2 and MX2 .\nThis means that the total rapidity difference Y = ln(1/x) between the projectile (\u03b3 \u2217 ) and\nthe target (h), as well as the rapidity gap Ygap = ln(1/xP ) can increase arbitrarily large,\nbut such that their difference Y \u2212 Ygap = ln(1/\u03b2) remains finite, and not too large (see\nEq. (2.13) below for the precise condition). Note that our definitions for either diffraction\nor its high energy limit are not the most general possible ones (e.g., one could consider\ndiffractive processes in which the target too breaks up after the collision), but they do\ncover interesting physical situations and, besides, they are constrained by the limitations\nof the subsequent theoretical developments.\nAs also mentioned in the Introduction, we shall directly compute the diffractive cross\u2013\nmin\nsection integrated over the rapidity gap from some minimal value Ygap\nup to Y . For\nconvenience, from now on, we shall reserve the simpler notation Ygap for this minimal\nrapidity gap, as this quantity will appear very often, and we shall measure the actual\nrapidity by the corresponding \u03b2\u2013variable, cf. Fig. 2. We have, clearly, the following relation\n\u03b3\nd\u03c3el\u03b3\nd\u03c3diff\n2\n(Y, Ygap , Q ) = 2 (Y, Q2 ) +\n2\nd b\ndb\n\nY \u2212Y\nZ gap\n0\n\n\u03b3\nd\u03c3diff\nd ln(1/\u03b2) 2\n(Y, ln(1/\u03b2), Q2)\nd b d ln(1/\u03b2)\n\n(2.1)\nbetween the integrated quantity in the l.h.s., that we shall explicitly compute in what\nfollows, and the differential cross\u2013section per unit rapidity - which appears under the\nintegral sign in the r.h.s. and is the quantity usually considered in phenomenological\n10\n\n\fstudies of diffraction. As also indicated by the notations in Eq. (2.1), we shall consider\ncross\u2013sections at fixed impact parameter b. The first, \"elastic\", term in the r.h.s. of the\nabove equation is simply the boundary term for the integration at \u03b2 = 1, or Ygap = Y :\n\u03b3\nd\u03c3el\u03b3\nd\u03c3diff\n2\n(Y, Q ) \u2261\n(Y, Y, Q2 ) ,\nd2 b\nd2 b\n\n(2.2)\n\nand the reason why we refer to it as \"elastic\" is because, within the 'leading\u2013logarithmic\napproximation' in ln(1/\u03b2) that we shall use, it corresponds to the elastic scattering between the dissociation products of the virtual photon and the target (see Sect. 2.1 below\nfor details and Appendix B for results going beyond the leading\u2013logarithmic approximation alluded to above). Note however that the scattering is not elastic from the viewpoint\nof the virtual photon itself (see the discussion at the end of Sect. 2.1 and also Fig. 8).\nLet us briefly describe here the physical picture underlying our subsequent developments.\nIn a convenient 'dipole' frame in which the hadron h carries most of the total energy, the\nscattering between the virtual photon \u03b3 \u2217 and the target proceeds as follows: Long before\nthe scattering (say, at time t0 \u2192 \u2212\u221e), the virtual photon dissociates into a quark\u2013\nantiquark pair in a color singlet state (a 'color dipole'), which then evolves through soft\ngluon radiation until it meets the hadron (at time t = 0) and scatters off the color fields\ntherein. At high energy, the color dipole and the accompanying soft gluons are eigenstates\nof the S\u2013matrix operator - the collision acts merely as a color rotation on these states\n-, and the original picture of diffraction by Good and Walker [58] can be taken over:\nThe diffractive process \u03b3 \u2217 h \u2192 Xh consists in the elastic scattering between the various\nFock space components of the projectile and the target. More precisely, we shall argue\nbelow that this simple picture holds only in a well\u2013tuned frame, in which the rapidity Y0\nof the target coincides with the (minimal) rapidity gap Ygap in the final state 4 . Such a\nspecial choice of the frame is necessary in order to avoid the explicit treatment of the\nfinal state interactions, i.e., the gluon emissions and absorptions which take place in the\nwavefunction of the projectile after the time of scattering, and whose detailed description\ngoes beyond the dipole picture.\nAs implicit in the above picture, we shall restrict ourselves to the leading logarithmic\napproximation at high energy, in which the evolution consists in the emission of 'small\u2013\nx gluons', that is, gluons which carry only a small fraction x \u226a 1 of the longitudinal\nmomentum of their parent parton. So long as the energy is not too high, the evolution\nremains linear and is described by the BFKL formalism [13], which leads to a rapid growth\nof the gluon occupation numbers. But for sufficiently high energy, saturation effects which\ntame this growth start to be important [9, 68, 69], and introduce non\u2013linear effects in\nthe evolution equations [4\u20138, 10, 14]. In the physical situations that we shall consider, the\nprojectile will be always dilute and thus evolve linearly. On the other hand, we shall allow\nfor arbitrarily high energies (and thus for saturation effects) on the side of the target.\nThe high\u2013energy evolution will be further simplified through approximations valid at\nlarge Nc . On the projectile side, the combination of the BFKL evolution with the large\u2013\n4\n\nIn practice, the identification of Y0 with Ygap must hold within the accuracy of the leading\nlogarithmic approximation: Y0 and Ygap can differ by an amount dY such that \u1fb1s dY \u226a 1.\n\n11\n\n\fNc approximation leads to Mueller's 'color dipole picture' [12] : When Nc \u2192 \u221e, a gluon\ncan be effectively replaced with a pointlike quark\u2013antiquark pair in a color octet state,\nand a soft gluon emission from a color dipole can be described as the splitting of the\noriginal dipole into two new dipoles with a common leg. In this picture, the original q q\u0304\npair produced by the dissociation of the virtual photon evolves through successive dipole\nsplittings and becomes an onium - i.e., a collection of dipoles - at the time of scattering.\nStrictly speaking, the dipole picture provides only the norm of the onium wavefunction,\nthat is, the probability distribution for the dipole configurations within the onium [12, 16].\nBut, as we shall see, this knowledge is indeed sufficient to compute diffraction within the\npresent formalism. On the target side, the large\u2013Nc approximation turns out to be essential\nfor the successful construction of evolution equations for the amplitudes describing the\nscattering between the projectile dipoles and the target gluons [4, 14, 15].\n2.1\n\nDipole factorization for the diffractive cross\u2013section\n\nTo develop our formalism, let us ignore for a while the electromagnetic process \u03b3 \u2217 \u2192 q q\u0304 (at\nhigh energy, this process factorizes out [70, 71] and can be easily reintroduced later; see the\nbeginning of Sect. 4.2), and focus on the onium\u2013hadron (Oh) scattering. The quantity\nthat we would like to compute is the probability Pdiff (x, y; Y, Ygap) for the diffractive\nprocess Oh \u2192 Xh in which the hadron h undergoes elastic scattering while the onium\nO dissociates into some arbitrary hadronic state X which is separated from the outgoing\nhadron by a rapidity gap equal to, or larger than, Ygap (with Ygap \u2264 Y , of course). In\nthis definition, x and y are the transverse coordinates of the quark and, respectively, the\nantiquark in the original q q\u0304 pair, the one which evolves into the onium.\nThe probability Pdiff (x, y; Y, Ygap) is, of course, frame\u2013independent, but in what follows\nwe shall derive an explicit expression for it by working in the specific frame in which\nYgap coincides with the rapidity Y0 of the target (and where the projectile has therefore a\nrapidity 5 Y \u2212 Y0 = Y \u2212 Ygap ). To avoid redundant notations, we shall replace everywhere\nYgap \u2192 Y0 and write, e.g., Pdiff (x, y; Y, Y0). The final formula that we shall arrive at (see\nSect. 2.2 for a derivation, and Figs. 3 and 4 for graphical representations) reads\nPdiff (x, y; Y, Y0) =\n\n\u221e Z\nX\n\nN =1\n\nd\u0393N PN ({zi }; Y \u2212 Y0 )\n\nD\n\n1 \u2212 S(1)S(2) * * * S(N)\n\nE\n\n2\nY0\n\n, (2.3)\n\nwith notations to be explained now:\ni) PN ({zi }; Y \u2212 Y0 ) is the probability density to produce a given configuration of N\ndipoles after a rapidity evolution Y \u2212 Y0 starting with an original dipole (x, y).

For the projectile, we illustrate the gluon dynamics\nbefore and at the time of scattering. The final hadronic state X can be formed with an arbitrary\nnumber of gluons produced via 'final state interactions' (see the discussion in Sect. 2.2). The\ngluons in the target recombine back before the final state, so that the hadron emerges intact\nfrom the collision. For simplicity, we exhibit only two\u2013gluon exchanges.\n\nzN \u2261 y. Also, N d\u0393N with d\u0393N = d2 z1 d2 z2 . . . d2 zN \u22121 represents the sum over all\nthe configurations.

(Recall that, in the\nhigh\u2013energy scattering, a dipole is an eigenstate of the interaction [70, 71] and the internal configuration of the target is frozen during the duration of the collision; see also\nEqs. (2.16)\u2013(2.17) below.) We shall also need the scattering amplitude corresponding to\na single dipole, defined as T (i) \u2261 1 \u2212 S(i).

The same as in Fig. 3 but in the large\u2013Nc limit. Each gluon in the wavefunction of the\nvirtual photon has been replaced with a pointlike quark\u2013antiquark pair in a color octet state. The\ngluons inside the target wavefunction are not shown explicitly anymore. The relative simplicity\nof the q q\u0304 representation allows us to also exhibit some multiple gluon exchanges, corresponding\nto unitarity corrections.\n\ncorresponding expectation values, depend upon the rapidity interval Y0 available for its\ninternal evolution. Note that, in a given event (i.e., for a given configuration of the color\nfields in the target), the N dipoles scatter independently from each other - the total\nS\u2013matrix SN is simply the product of N factors corresponding to the individual dipoles\n-, but correlations are generally introduced by the average over the target (because the\ncolor fields there have non\u2013trivial correlations). Thus, the expectation value hSN iY0 is not\nfactorizing anymore. Such target correlations will play an important role in the subsequent\ndiscussion in this paper.\niii) The quantity |h1 \u2212 S(1)S(2) * * * S(N)iY0 |2 \u2261 |hAN iY0 |2 is recognized as the probability for the elastic scattering between a given set of N dipoles and the target. Thus, as\nanticipated, the diffractive probability (2.3) represents the projectile average of the elastic\nprobabilities for all the possible (dipole) configurations in the projectile. Thus defined,\nthe diffraction includes, but it does not reduces to, the truly elastic collision, in which\nthe onium as a whole scatters elastically off the target. The difference appears because,\nwhereas the individual dipoles (or gluons) are eigenstates of the interaction, this is not\ntrue also for their superposition (the onium), since the various states in this superposition\ninteract differently with the target.\nThe elastic probability Pel for onium\u2013target scattering is rather computed as\nPel (x, y; Y ) = |1 \u2212 S(x, y; Y )|2 \u2261 |A(x, y; Y )|2 ,\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere S(x, y; Y ) is the diagonal S\u2013matrix element, S \u2261 h\u03a8in |S|\u03a8in i = h\u03a8in |\u03a8out i, which\nmeasures the overlap between the final state emerging from the collision and the initial\nstate prior to it. Therefore, Psurvival \u2261 |S|2 is the probability that the original state (for\nthe ensemble target+projectile) survives intact after the collision, whereas\nPinel (x, y; Y ) \u2261 1 \u2212 |S(x, y; Y )|2 ,\n\n(2.8)\n14\n\n\fis the probability for some inelastic process to occur. In what follows, the amplitude\nA \u2261 1 \u2212S for the elastic scattering will be succinctly referred to as the forward amplitude.\nWithin the present framework, this quantity can be computed as\nA(x, y; Y ) =\n\n\u221e Z\nX\n\nN =1\n\nD\n\nd\u0393N PN ({zi }; Y \u2212 Y0 ) 1 \u2212 S(1)S(2) * * * S(N)\n\nE\n\nY0\n\n,\n\n(2.9)\n\nwhich is perhaps a more familiar formula (various versions of it can be found in the\nliterature [10, 30, 72]), and will be also derived below.\nAs indicated by its notation, the forward amplitude A is independent of the rapidity\ndivider Y0 . This is a priori true on physical grounds - since, in the computation of A,\nY0 plays no dynamical role, but merely specifies the Lorentz frame - and is also verified\nby our explicit formula (2.9), within its accuracy limits (see the discussion below). In\nparticular, one can choose to compute A in the frame where Y0 \u2243 Y . In that frame, the\nprojectile is just an elementary dipole (x, y), without additional gluons, and therefore\nA(x, y; Y ) = 1 \u2212 hS(x, y)iY \u2261 hT (x, y)iY , in agreement with Eqs. (2.9) and (2.4). Similarly, the elastic probability (2.7) can be computed as the elastic scattering of the q q\u0304 pair\nalone: according to Eqs. (2.3), (2.7), and (2.9) we can write\nPel (x, y; Y ) = |hT (x, y)iY |2 = Pdiff (x, y; Y, Y ) ,\n\n(2.10)\n\nwhere the second equality reflects the physically obvious fact that an elastic scattering is\nthe same as a diffractive event having Y0 = Y . This explains the identification performed\nin Eq. (2.2).\nVia the optical theorem, the forward amplitude (2.9) also determines the total (or 'inclusive') cross\u2013section 6 :\nPtot (x, y; Y ) = 2 Re A(x, y; Y ) = Pel + Pinel .\n\n(2.11)\n\nAt this point, a word of caution is necessary, concerning a slight abuse in our terminology: The various \"probabilities\" introduced so far are strictly speaking differential\ncross\u2013sections for onium\u2013hadron scattering at fixed impact parameter; e.g.,\nd\u03c3tot\n(r, b, Y ) = Ptot (x, y; Y ),\nd2 b\n\nd\u03c3diff\n(r, b, Y, Y0) = Pdiff (x, y; Y, Y0),\nd2 b\n\n(2.12)\n\n(r \u2261 x \u2212 y and b \u2261 (x + y)/2 are the transverse size and the impact parameter of the\noriginal q q\u0304 pair). As such, these quantities are certainly proportional to the corresponding\nscattering probabilities, but they are not necessarily bound to be smaller than one. Rather,\nthey are constrained by the unitarity of the S\u2013matrix, which in the high energy regime\n(where the scattering amplitudes are predominantly real) requires 0 \u2264 hAN i \u2264 1 for\nany N. This condition, together with the above formulae, implies the standard inequality\nPdiff \u2264 12 Ptot [59], together with a series of upper bounds like A \u2264 1, Pdiff \u2264 1, and\n6\n\nNote that our definitions for the scattering amplitudes T and A differ by a factor of i from the\nusual definitions in the textbooks. With our conventions, these amplitudes are predominantly\nreal at high energy.\n\n15\n\n\fPtot \u2264 2. Within the formalism that we shall use below to compute the dipole amplitudes,\nall these constraints are correctly respected, and the various upper bounds are saturated\nin the high\u2013energy limit.\nBefore we turn to a derivation of Eqs. (2.3) and (2.9) in the next subsection, let us specify\ntheir range of validity in rapidity, and explain how to compute the dipole probabilities\nPN (Y \u2212 Y0 ) and the target\u2013averaged matrix elements hAN iY0 which enter these formulae.\nThe rapidity Y \u2212 Y0 of the projectile should be small enough for the saturation effects to\nremain negligible. This in turn requires [12, 16]\nY \u2212 Y0 \u226a\n\n1\nN2\nln 2c\n\u1fb1s\n\u1fb1s\n\n(2.13)\n\nwhere \u1fb1s \u2261 \u03b1s Nc /\u03c0 should be treated as a fixed quantity in the large\u2013Nc limit. (Recall that the typical rapidity interval necessary for the emission of one small\u2013x gluon is\ndY \u223c 1/\u1fb1s .) For rapidities satisfying this constraint, the probabilities PN (Y \u2212 Y0 ) can be\nobtained by solving a 'Master equation' [16], actually, a set of coupled, linear, equations\nfor the evolution with Y , whose structure makes it clear that the dipole evolution in the\ndilute regime is a Markovian stochastic process (see also Refs. [4, 73]). Alternatively, the\ngenerating functional for PN , to be introduced in Eq. (2.35) below, obey the non\u2013linear\nevolution equation (2.36), originally derived by Mueller [12]. For latter convenience, let\nus display here the expressions for PN generated after only one step in the evolution, that\nis, for Y \u2212 Y0 = dY and to linear order in the small quantity \u1fb1s dY :\n\u1fb1s\ndz M(x, y, z),\nP1 (dY ) = 1 \u2212 dY\n2\u03c0\n\u1fb1s\nP2 (z|dY ) = dY\nM(x, y, z),\n2\u03c0\nZ\n\n(2.14)\n\nand PN (dY ) = 0 for N \u2265 3. In these equations,\nM(x, y, z) \u2261\n\n(x \u2212 y)2\n,\n(x \u2212 z)2 (y \u2212 z)2\n\n(2.15)\n\nis known as the 'dipole kernel' [12] : (\u1fb1s /2\u03c0)M(x, y, z) is the differential probability for\nan elementary dipole (x, y) to split into two dipoles (x, z) and (z, y) per unit rapidity.\nNote that the integral over z in the formula for P1 has logarithmic singularities at z = x\nand z = y. Such singularities are expected at the level of the dipole probabilities, but they\ncancel out in the calculation of physical quantities, as it can be checked on the examples\nof Eqs. (2.3) and (2.9).\nConsider now the matrix elements for dipole\u2013target scattering: At high energy, the S\u2013\nmatrix S(x, y) corresponding to a single dipole (x, y) can be computed in the eikonal\napproximation as\nS(x, y) =\n\n\u0011\n1 \u0010 \u2020\ntr V (x)V (y) ,\nNc\n\n\u001a\n\nV \u2020 (x) = P exp ig\n\nZ\n\n\u001b\n\n\u2212\na\n, (2.16)\ndx\u2212 A+\na (x , x) t\n\nwhere the Wilson lines V \u2020 (x) and V (y) represent the color rotations suffered by the quark\nand, respectively, the antiquark after their scattering off the color field A+\na in the target.\n16\n\n\f(The ta 's are the generators of the SU(Nc ) algebra in the fundamental representation and\nthe symbol P denotes path\u2013ordering in x\u2212 .) Note that, in our conventions, the projectile\npropagates in the negative z (or positive x\u2212 ) direction, so it couples to the A+ component\nof the color field in the target. At high energy and in a suitable gauge, this is the only non\u2013\ntrivial component, and the average over the target wavefunction amounts to a functional\naverage over A+ (the 'color glass' average [8, 9]) :\nhS(x, y)iY0 =\n\nZ\n\nD[A+ ] WY0 [A+ ]\n\n\u0011\n1 \u0010 \u2020\ntr V (x) V (y) ,\nNc\n\n(2.17)\n\nwhere the 'color glass weight function' WY0 [A+ ] (a functional probability density) can be\ninterpreted as the squared wavefunction of the target and depends upon the respective\nrapidity Y0 . The expectation value hSN iY0 for the scattering of N dipoles is defined similarly. Note that, physically, the non\u2013linear effects in A+ included via the Wilson lines in\nEqs. (2.16)\u2013(2.17) describe multiple scattering to all orders.\nIn the high\u2013gluon density regime where the gluon\u2013number fluctuations become negligible,\nthe evolution of the weight function WY0 with increasing Y0 is described by the JIMWLK\nequation [6\u20138] - a functional, non\u2013linear, equation of the Fokker\u2013Plank type. Via equations like (2.17), the JIMWLK equation generates an hierarchy of ordinary evolution\nequations for the dipole amplitudes hSN iY0 , originally derived by Balitsky [5]. The non\u2013\nlinear effects encoded in the JIMWLK equation describe gluon saturation in the target\nwavefunction and translate into unitarity corrections in the Balitsky equations.\nHowever, as pointed out in the Introduction, the gluon\u2013number fluctuations missed by the\nBalitsky\u2013JIMWLK equations are in fact essential for the physics at high energy, in that\nthey represent the source for the higher\u2013point correlations responsible for saturation. So\nfar, the combined effects of fluctuations and saturation on the dipole scattering at high\nenergy have been taken into account only in the large\u2013Nc limit [2\u20134, 15], where a new set\nof evolution equations has been derived [4, 14] - the 'Pomeron loop equations' alluded to\nin the Introduction (see also Refs. [25, 26, 74]). In what follows, we shall assume that the\ndipole amplitudes hSN iY0 obey these new equations, which within the limits of the large\u2013\nNc approximation are valid up to arbitrarily high energy. In addition to the standard\nBFKL terms [13], these equations include non\u2013linear terms - which correspond to gluon\nsaturation in the target and ensure the unitarization of the scattering amplitudes at high\nenergy - and source terms - which correspond to dipole splitting in the dilute part of the\ntarget wavefunction and encode the relevant, gluon\u2013number, fluctuations at large Nc . The\nperturbation theory for these equations can be organized in terms of \"BFKL pomerons\"\n(the Green's function for the BFKL equation [13]) which interact via \"triple Pomeron\nvertices\" [35, 74, 75] for Pomeron splitting and merging. Accordingly, the solutions to\nthese equations naturally encompass the Pomeron loops. In Fig. 5, we illustrate some\nPomeron loops effects in the calculation of the forward scattering amplitude (2.9).\nTo summarize, all the ingredients appearing in Eqs. (2.3) and (2.9) can be computed, at\nleast in principle, by solving evolution equations which are explicitly known. These equations are valid for large Nc and up to rapidities Y and Y0 which can be arbitrarily large,\nbut such that their difference Y \u2212 Y0 obeys the condition (2.13). Within this condition,\nthe expression (2.9) for the forward amplitude is independent of the rapidity divider Y0 ,\n17\n\n\fFig. 5. Pomeron loops in the forward amplitude for onium-hadron scattering.\n\nas it should. Indeed, it has been demonstrated in Refs. [30, 72] that the Y0 \u2013dependence in\nthe r.h.s. of Eq. (2.9) cancels out exactly when using the Master equation for the dipole\nprobabilities PN (Y \u2212 Y0 ) together with the (large\u2013Nc version of the) Balitsky\u2013JIMWLK\nequations for the dipole amplitudes hSN iY0 . Now, as argued before, the correct equations at high energy are not the Balitsky\u2013JIMWLK equations, but rather the Pomeron\nloop equations of Refs. [4, 14]. The latter include the effects of gluon number fluctuations,\nwhich are additional sources of Y0 \u2013dependence. In a more general calculation of A(x, y; Y )\nwhich would be valid in any frame, such additional dependencies would be compensated\nby recombination effects in the wavefunction of the projectile. However, in any 'dipole\nframe' which satisfies the condition (2.13) such recombination effects are truly negligible,\nso Eq. (2.9) is indeed independent of Y0 , up to higher\u2013order corrections 7 . Incidentally,\nthe above argument also shows that our formula for the diffractive probability, Eq. (2.3),\nis not independent of Y0 , as expected on physical grounds.\nFor later convenience, let us also introduce here the inelastic diffraction, a process which,\nas shown in Ref. [59] in the context of hadron\u2013hadron collisions, is a direct probe of\n'parton' (here, dipole) fluctuations in the wavefunction of the projectile. The corresponding\nprobability is obtained by simply subtracting out the (totally) elastic component (2.7)\nfrom the diffractive probability (2.3):\ninel\nPdiff\n(x, y; Y, Y0) = Pdiff (x, y; Y, Y0) \u2212 Pel (x, y; Y ) .\n\n(2.18)\n\nThis formula takes on a particularly suggestive form after noticing that Eqs. (2.3) and\n(2.9) can be rewritten as (with simplified notations)\n7\n\nThis does not mean that the physical consequences of the gluon\u2013number fluctuations are also\nnegligible (these will be discussed in the next sections). It is only the induced Y0 \u2013dependence\nwhich is small indeed.\n\n18\n\n\fPdiff (x, y; Y, Y0) =\n\nD\n\nh A itarget\n\n2E\n\nproj\n\n,\n\nA(x, y; Y ) =\n\nD\n\nh A itarget\n\nE\n\nproj\n\n.\n\n(2.19)\n\nIn these formulae, the target\u2013averaged amplitude Atarget \u2261 h A itarget is still an 'operator'\nfrom the point of view of the projectile, in the sense of depending upon a fixed configuration of dipoles. Also, at high energy, the amplitude is predominantly real, so one can\nignore the modulus sign in the previous equations. We thus finally arrive at [59]\ninel\nPdiff\n(x, y; Y, Y0) =\n\nD\n\nA2target\n\nE\n\nproj\n\n\u2212\n\nD\n\nAtarget\n\nE2\n\nproj\n\n,\n\n(2.20)\n\ninel\nwhich clearly exhibits the fact that Pdiff\nis a measure of the dispersion of the dipole\ndistribution within the wavefunction of the projectile. The dipole picture that we employ\nhere provides an explicit realization for the projectile, and thus allows one to compute this\ndispersion and any other quantity pertinent to the distribution of dipoles. However, our\nmain emphasis in what follows will be not on the effects of fluctuations in the projectile\n(these are already well understood within the dipole picture; see, e.g., Refs. [4, 11, 12,\n16, 72, 73]), but rather on the physical consequences of the gluon number fluctuations\nin the target, as encoded in the evolution equations with Pomeron loops [4, 14]. These\nfluctuations affect separately all the quantities introduced above (A, Pdiff , Ptot , etc.),\nbecause of their influence on the dipole scattering amplitudes hSN iY0 which enter the\ncorresponding formulae.\n\nLet us conclude this subsection with a warning against the abusive interpretation of the\nnotion of 'inelastic diffraction' in the context of deep inelastic scattering. As we shall see\nat the beginning of Sect. 4, the diffractive probability (2.3) determines the 'integrated'\ncross\u2013section for DIS diffraction, i.e., the quantity in the l.h.s. of Eq. (2.1). In view of\nthis, and of the identification in Eq. (2.10), it becomes clear that the separation of \u03c3diff in\nbetween an 'elastic' plus an 'integral' piece, as shown in the r.h.s. of Eq. (2.1), corresponds\nto the decomposition of Pdiff in between its elastic and inelastic components, cf. Eq. (2.18):\ninel\nPdiff = Pel + Pdiff\n. However, in DIS, and unlike in hadron\u2013hadron collisions, these two\npieces of \u03c3diff cannot be separately measured. Indeed, even a process in which the onium\nscatters elastically (see Fig. 8) still appears as inelastic at the level of the DIS experiment,\nbecause the elastically scattered q q\u0304 pair does not recombine back into a virtual photon\nin the final state, but rather emerges as a hadronic state. Hence, the only experimentally\nrelevant quantity is the 'total' diffractive cross\u2013section, as determined by Pdiff .\n2.2\n\nJustifying the dipole factorization\n\nTo justify the above formulae for dipole factorization (in particular, those pertinent to\ndiffraction), we shall use the light\u2013cone wavefunction formalism, as developed in the light\u2013\ncone gauge A\u2212\na = 0 (which is best suited for a study of the eikonal scattering of the\nprojectile within our conventions). Our presentation will be rather sketchy, as similar\ntechniques and manipulations can be widely found in the literature, and it will focus on\nthe non\u2013trivial aspects of the argument only.\nLet us denote by |\u03a8(\u2212\u221e)i, |\u03a8(0\u2212 )i, |\u03a8(0+ )i, and |\u03a8(\u221e)i the wavefunction of the complete system target plus projectile (including their hadronic descendants in the case of\n19\n\n\fthe final state) at times 8 t = \u2212\u221e (long before the scattering), t = 0\u2212 (just before the\nscattering), t = 0+ (immediately after the scattering), and, respectively, t = \u221e (the final\nhadronic state which is measured by the detector). We have:\n|\u03a8(0\u2212 )i = |O(Y \u2212 Y0 )i \u2297 |h(Y0 )i ,\n\n(2.21)\n\nwhere the two factors in the r.h.s. are the states of the projectile and, respectively, the\ntarget as produced after a rapidity evolution Y \u2212 Y0 and, respectively, Y0 .\nIn the case of the projectile, the initial state for this evolution is the elementary color\ndipole (x, y) produced by the dissociation of the virtual photon: |O(0)i = |(x, y)i (the\ncolor indices are kept implicit; see, e.g., Refs. [46, 52] for details). The evolved state at\nt = 0\u2212 is then a superposition of partonic states containing the original q q\u0304 pair (x, y)\ntogether with an arbitrary number of soft gluons in a given spatial and color configuration.\nThe detailed structure of such individual Fock states turns out not to be necessary for\nthe present purposes. Rather, we shall simply denote by |Ni a generic state containing\nthe q q\u0304 pair (x, y) together with N \u2212 1 small\u2013x gluons. We thus write, quite generically:\n|O(Y \u2212 Y0 )i =\n\nX\nN\n\ncN (Y \u2212 Y0 ) |Ni ,\n\n(2.22)\n\nwhere the sum over N should be really understood as a sum over the number of gluons,\nan integral over their transverse coordinates, and a sum over their polarizations and color\nconfigurations (we refer again to Refs. [46, 52] for more precise notations).\nConcerning the target, its precise initial state at t = \u2212\u221e is unimportant here. Rather,\nall that we need to assume is that at the time of scattering the target can be described as\na superposition of states with a given color field (eigenstates of the gauge field operator\nA \u2261 A+ ) with coefficients \u03a6[A] which depend upon the rapidity Y0 :\n|h(Y0)i =\n\nZ\n\nD[A] \u03a6[A](Y0 ) |Ai .\n\n(2.23)\n\nConsider now the onium\u2013hadron collision which takes place at time t = 0. As anticipated,\nat high energy the partonic Fock\u2013space states composing the onium are eigenstates of the\ncollision operator: the transverse positions and the spins, or polarizations, of the 'partons'\n(quarks and gluons) are not changed by the scattering, while their color orientations undergo a field\u2013dependent precession described by Wilson lines. We can write, schematically,\n\n|\u03a8(0+ )i =\n\nZ\n\nD[A] \u03a6[A](Y0 )\n\nX\nN\n\ncN (Y \u2212 Y0 )\n\nN\n\u0010Y\n\ni=1\n\n\u0011\n\nSi [A] |Ni \u2297 |Ai ,\n\n(2.24)\n\nwhere Si [A] is the S\u2013matrix for the individual parton i, and is a Wilson line (with generally\nopen color indices).\n8\n\nStrictly speaking, the role of the 'time variables' in the present formalism is played by the\nlight\u2013cone coordinates - x\u2212 in the case of the projectile and, respectively, x+ in the case of the\ntarget; for simplicity, we shall use the more intuitive notation t.\n\n20\n\n\fFor all the processes that we are interested in, the hadronic target emerges intact from\nthe collision, i.e., it undergoes elastic scattering, so we need only the projection of the\noutgoing state on the target state prior to the collision:\n|\u03a8diff (0+ )i \u2261 |h(Y0 )i hh(Y0)|\u03a8(0+ )i\n=\n\nZ\n\n\u2261\n\nX\nN\n\nD[A] \u03a6[A](Y0 )\n\n2\n\nX\nN\n\ncN (Y \u2212 Y0 )\n\nN\nDY\n\ni=1\n\ncN (Y \u2212 Y0 )\nE\n\nSi [A]\n\nY0\n\nN\n\u0010Y\n\ni=1\n\n\u0011\n\nSi [A] |Ni \u2297 |h(Y0 )i\n\n|Ni \u2297 |h(Y0 )i ,\n\n(2.25)\n\nwhere the brackets in the third line refer to the average over the target wavefunction.\nWith the identification WY0 [A] \u2261 |\u03a6[A](Y0 )|2 , this target averaging is recognized as the\ncolor glass averaging in Eq. (2.17).\nEq. (2.25) makes it manifest that, in the calculation of diffractive processes, the average\nover the target wavefunction is to be performed already at the level of the amplitude\n[39], rather than at the level of the squared amplitude (which is the quantity defining a\nprobability; see Eq. (2.28) below). This peculiarity is, of course, related to our restriction to\nprocesses in which the target undergoes elastic scattering, and would not be true anymore\nfor more general, diffractive, processes in which the target too is allowed to break up after\nthe collision (see also the discussion at the end of this subsection).\nNote also that the target averaging in Eq. (2.25) automatically implies a color projection\nof the outgoing projectile onto color singlet states: Since the post\u2013collisional state of the\ntarget (which is the same as its initial state |h(Y0)i) is a color singlet, so must be also the\ncorresponding state of the projectile. In mathematical terms, the weight function WY0 [A]\nQ\nmust be gauge\u2013invariant, so the operation of averaging N\ni=1 Si [A] with this weight function\nmust close all the Wilson lines into gauge\u2013invariant color traces. Under this average and\nQ\nfor large Nc , the product N\ni=1 Si [A] naturally reduces to the product of N dipolar factors,\nwhere is each of them is like the one appearing in Eq. (2.16).\nThe final state at the time of detection is obtained by letting the 'diffractive' state in\nEq. (2.25) evolve from t = 0 up to t = \u221e under the action of the unitary evolution\noperator U(\u221e, 0) :\n|\u03a8diff (\u221e)i = U(\u221e, 0) |\u03a8diff (0+ )i .\n\n(2.26)\n\nIt is this late time evolution which is responsible for the 'final state interactions' alluded to\nin the previous subsection: under the action of U(\u221e, 0), some of the soft gluons contained\nin the diffractive state at t = 0+ may recombine with each other, so that the ensuing\nrapidity gap in a given event (that is, for a given final state) may be actually larger than\nY0 . (See Figs. 6 and 7 for an example.) In fact, the largest allowed gap is equal to Y and\ncorresponds to elastic scattering 9 , i.e., to the situation where all the gluons (or dipoles)\nin the final state recombine back before their detection into the original dipole (x, y).\nThis is depicted in Fig. 8.\n9\n\nThis is consistent with the fact that, for Y0 = Y , the diffractive probability (2.3) reduces to\ninel (Y = Y ) = 0.\nthe corresponding elastic one, cf. Eq. (2.10) : that is, Pdiff\n0\n\n21\n\n\fFig. 6. A particular diagram contributing to the diffractive process \u03b3 \u2217 h \u2192 Xh. The dashed vertical line at t = \u221e indicates the final (partonic) state. In the direct amplitude, a three\u2013gluon state\n(together with the original q q\u0304 pair) describes a component of the virtual photon wavefunction\nwhich interacts with the target hadron (not shown here) at time t = 0. After the scattering, final\nstate interactions (gluon recombination) occur and at t = \u221e only two gluons are \"measured\".\nSimilarly, in the complex conjugate amplitude, the wavefunction contains two soft gluons at the\ntime of scattering; after the collision, these gluons recombine with each other, and finally an\nadditional soft gluon is emitted before the time of measurement. The rapidity gap associated\nwith this particular process is larger than Y0 .\n\nFig. 7. The same as in Fig. 6 in the large\u2013Nc limit; each gluon in the wavefunction of the virtual\nphoton has been replaced with a pointlike quark\u2013antiquark pair in a color octet state.\n\nOn the other hand, within the present assumptions, the final gap can clearly not be smaller\nthan Y0 : This is so because of our restriction to processes in which the target undergoes\nelastic scattering, so that none of the virtual quanta initially contained within the target\nwavefunction (and which are distributed in rapidity from 0 to Y0 ) can be released in the\nfinal state. Since, on the other hand, there is no activity in the projectile wavefunction\nat rapidities smaller than Y0 , it is clear that all the hadrons emerging in the final states\nand coming from the dissociation of the virtual photon must have a rapidity equal, or\nsuperior, to Y0 . Therefore, the minimal rapidity gap is indeed Y0 . (See Fig. 9.)\nIn principle, it should be possible to compute the probability Pdiff (x, y; Y, Ygap) for any\n22\n\n\fFig. 8. Another diagram contributing to the diffractive process \u03b3 \u2217 h \u2192 Xh. Both the amplitude and the c.c. amplitude correspond to contributions to the forward amplitude (2.9) for\ndipole\u2013hadron scattering. Hence, this diagram is also an illustration of elastic dipole\u2013hadron\nscattering, Eq. (2.7). (Notice that this is not an elastic scattering for \u03b3 \u2217 as well, since the virtual\nphoton does not appear in the final state.) Here the rapidity gap takes its maximum value Y .\n\nFig. 9. A final example for the diffractive process \u03b3 \u2217 h \u2192 Xh. Here there are no final state\ninteractions at all and the rapidity gap in this case is equal to its minimum value Y0 .\n\ngiven value for the minimal rapidity gap Ygap within the range Y \u2265 Ygap \u2265 Y0 . To that\naim, one should explicitly follow the evolution of the outgoing state after the collision,\nas indicated in Eq. (2.26), and then project |\u03a8diff (\u221e)i onto final states in which the\nhadrons released through the fragmentation of the projectile have rapidities Y \u2265 Ygap .\nThis procedure would select those states within |\u03a8diff (0+ )i in which all the projectile\ngluons with rapidities between Y0 and Ygap have recombined back in the evolution from\nt = 0+ up to t = \u221e. Very recently, a more general formalism has been proposed [76],\nwhich in principle allows one to achieve this goal, and thus to compute the diffractive\nscattering in a generic frame (and for generic values of Nc ). It would be interesting to see\nhow our present factorization emerges from that formalism.\nHowever, our main point here is precisely that the calculation of Pdiff (x, y; Y, Ygap) can be\ndrastically simplified by conveniently choosing the Lorentz frame - namely, by choosing\nY0 = Ygap -, since with this particular choice one does not need to worry about the final\n23\n\n\fstate interactions. Indeed, the condition that the gap be bigger than, or equal to, Y0 is\nautomatically satisfied within this kinematics, and it does not introduce any constraint\non the final state of the projectile. Hence, the probability for such a diffractive event\nis measured by the norm h\u03a8diff (\u221e)|\u03a8diff (\u221e)i of the final state, which is the same as the\nnorm of the state |\u03a8diff (0+ )i immediately after the collision, because of the unitarity of the\noperator U(\u221e, 0). One sometimes says that 'the final state interactions cancel between the\ndirect amplitude and the complex conjugate one', but in the present case this cancelation\nis an almost trivial consequence of our choice for the frame (see, e.g., Refs. [44, 77, 78] for\nless trivial cancelations of this type).\nMore precisely, in computing Pdiff one needs to consider the deviation between the outgoing diffractive state and the incoming state |\u03a8(0\u2212 )i (indeed, the final state must be\ndifferent from the initial one in order to have a real scattering). Thus, if one defines:\n|\u03b4\u03a8diff (0+ )i \u2261 |\u03a8diff (0+ )i \u2212 |\u03a8(0\u2212 )i ,\n\n(2.27)\n\nthen in this particular frame one can write\nPdiff (x, y; Y, Y0) = h\u03b4\u03a8diff (0+ )|\u03b4\u03a8diff (0+ )i\n=\n\nX\nN\n\n|cN (Y \u2212 Y0 )|\n\n2\n\nN\nDY\n\ni=1\n\nSi [A] \u2212 1\n\nE\n\n2\n\nY0\n\n,\n\n(2.28)\n\nwhere in writing the second line we have used the fact that the partonic states |Ni form\nan orthonormal basis. At large Nc , the norm |cN (Y \u2212 Y0 )|2 of the state |Ni (summed over\npolarizations and color indices) can be identified with the probability PN (Y \u2212 Y0 ) for a\nN\u2013dipole configuration in the dipole picture. With this identification, Eq. (2.28) is finally\nrecognized as our originally proposed expression, Eq. (2.3).\nThe expression (2.9) for the forward scattering amplitude can be similarly obtained : By\ndefinition, A \u2261 1 \u2212 S with S the forward S\u2013matrix element, computed as\nS(x, y; Y ) = h\u03a8(0\u2212 )|\u03a8(0+ )i\n=\n\nX\nN\n\n|cN (Y \u2212 Y0 )|2\n\nZ\n\nD[A] \u03a6[A](Y0 )\n\n2\n\nN\nY\n\nSi [A] ,\n\n(2.29)\n\ni=1\n\nwhich immediately leads to Eq. (2.9), as anticipated.\nThe previous discussion also explains our limitation to diffractive processes in which the\nhadronic target emerges intact from the collision. Of course, it would be very interesting\n(especially in view of applications to the phenomenology) to be able to describe the\nmore general processes \u03b3 \u2217 h \u2192 XY in which the hadron dissociates into some low\u2013mass\nhadronic system Y separated by a rapidity gap Ygap from the diffractive state X. But to\nthat aim, one cannot avoid a detailed study of the final state interactions, which in the\ncase of the target requires moreover a model for the hadronic structure.\nIt is finally interesting to compare our formula (2.3) for the diffractive probability to\nrelated results in the literature. In the next subsection we shall show that, under an\nadditional, mean field, approximation, our expression for Pdiff obeys a non\u2013linear equation\noriginally proposed by Kovchegov and Levin [44]. But before that we would like to point\n24\n\n\fout that Eq. (2.3) also encompasses other results from the previous literature. When\nthe target is not too dense so that multiple scattering is negligible, Eq. (2.3) reduces to\nthe expression employed by Bialas and Peschanski [36]. Namely, in the single scattering\nP\napproximation, we have AN \u2248 N\ni=1 T (i) (c.f., Eq. (2.6)), and then Eq. (2.3) becomes\nPdiff (x, y; Y, Y0) \u2248\n\nZ\n\nn(u, v; Y \u2212 Y0 ) |hT (u, v)iY0 |2\n\n+\n\nZ\n\nu,v\n\nui ,vi\n\nn(2) (u1 , v1 ; u2 , v2 ; Y \u2212 Y0 )hT (u1 , v1 )iY0 hT (u2 , v2 )i\u2217Y0 , (2.30)\n\nwhere n and n(2) denote, respectively, the average dipole number density and the average density of (distinct) dipole pairs in the projectile (see, e.g., Sect. 5 Ref. [4] for the\ncorresponding definitions) and the amplitude hT iY0 obeys the BFKL equation, as appropriate for a dilute target. Hence, Eq. (2.30) represents the BFKL approximation to Pdiff .\nPhysically, the first term in the r.h.s. of Eq. (2.30) represents the probability that the\nsame dipole scatters in both the direct and the complex conjugate amplitude, whereas\nthe second term describes the scattering of different dipoles.\nOn the other hand, for a generic, dense, target but a relatively small rapidity for the\nprojectile, such that \u1fb1s (Y \u2212 Y0 ) \u226a 1, one can restrict oneself to onium configurations\nwhich contain only two dipoles at the time of scattering. In that case, Eq. (2.3) reduces\nto results previously obtained by Kovner and Wiedemann [46] and by Munier and Shoshi\n[50]. The corresponding expressions will be presented in Sect. 4.2, where their high\u2013energy\nlimit will be also investigated.\nLet us emphasize here, however, some important differences in our treatment of the target expectation values as compared to Refs. [46, 50]. (i) In Ref. [50], the target averages\nhave been estimated in a mean field approximation (cf. Sect. 2.3) which neglects the correlations induced by gluon\u2013number fluctuations; such an approximation is reasonable at\nintermediate energies, but it eventually fails at sufficiently high energies (see the discussion in Sect. 3). (ii) In an attempt to relax the restriction to elastic scattering on the\ntarget side, the authors of Ref. [46] have suggested to replace the target averaging at the\nlevel of the amplitude with an averaging at the level of the (diffractive) probability. With\nour present notations, their suggestion amounts to the following replacement\nh A i Y0\n\n2\n\n\u2212\u2192 h A Psing A\u2217 iY0\n\n(2.31)\n\nwithin the r.h.s. of Eq. (2.3). Here, Psing is the projector onto color singlet states for the\nprojectile wavefunction, and it has been introduced to ensure that A involves only gauge\u2013\ninvariant operators; e.g., Psing A = AN , cf. Eq. (2.6), for a N\u2013dipole state. (In our previous\ndevelopments, such a projection was automatically ensured by the target averaging at the\nlevel of the amplitude, cf. Eq. (2.25).) However, with this new prescription, the target\naveraging is tantamount to summing over all the possible gauge\u2013invariant final states for\nthe target, without any restriction on their distribution in rapidity. But prior to scattering,\nthe target wavefunction had developed virtual excitations at all the rapidities y ranging\nfrom y = 0 up to y = Y0 , and in the absence of any rapidity veto on the final state,\nthere is no reason why these quanta should not materialize into hadrons occupying this\n25\n\n\fwhole rapidity interval. In other terms, with the target expectations values evaluated as\nin Ref. [46], one is actually including processes which have no rapidity gap whatsoever.\nSuch processes do not qualify as \"diffractive\" according to the usual terminology, and will\nbe not considered in what follows.\n2.3\n\nEvolution equations in the mean field approximation\n\nAlthough our main focus in this paper will be on the effects of fluctuations (i.e., of the\ndeviations from the mean field behaviour) in so far as the target expectation values are\nconcerned, it is nevertheless interesting at this level to slightly deviate from the main\nstream of the presentation and discuss the mean\u2013field version of our precedent results.\nThis is useful for, at least, two reasons: First, it will allow us to make contact with a\nnon\u2013linear equation for the diffractive probability previously proposed by Kovchegov and\nLevin [44], and thus clarify the conditions for the validity of the latter. Second, the mean\nfield approximation (MFA) that we shall introduce here will later serve us as a term of\ncomparison, to better emphasize the consequences of the fluctuations at high energy.\nSpecifically, the MFA consists in the following factorization assumption\nhS(1)S(2) * * * S(N)iY0 \u2248 hS(1)iY0 hS(2)iY0 * * * hS(N)iY0 ,\n\n(2.32)\n\nwhich neglects the correlations among the dipoles induced by their scattering off the\ntarget. Ultimately, this is an assumption about the absence of correlations in the target\ngluon distribution. (For instance, such a factorization holds indeed, at large Nc , within\nthe framework of the McLerran\u2013Venugopalan model [9] for the gluon distribution of a\nlarge nucleus. More generally, it amounts to use a Gaussian approximation for the CGC\nweight function in Eq. (2.17) [79].) In what follows we shall demonstrate that, with this\nadditional assumption, our formula (2.3) for the diffractive probability obeys indeed to the\nKovchegov\u2013Levin (KL) equation of Ref. [44]. During this procedure, and under similar\nassumptions, we shall also provide a rapid derivation of the Balitsky\u2013Kovchegov (BK)\nequation for the forward amplitude [5, 10].\nFor more clarity, we shall denote with a bar quantities computed in the mean field approximation. For instance:\nP\u0304diff (x, y; Y, Y0) =\n\n\u221e Z\nX\n\nN =1\n\n2\n\nd\u0393N PN ({zi }; Y \u2212 Y0 ) 1 \u2212 s1 s2 * * * sn ,\n\n(2.33)\n\nand similarly\nS\u0304(x, y; Y ) =\n\n\u221e Z\nX\n\nN =1\n\nd\u0393N PN ({zi }; Y \u2212 Y0 ) s1 s2 * * * sn .\n\n(2.34)\n\nIn these formulae, si is a simplified notation for hS(zi\u22121 , zi )iY0 , which in the present context\nis of course the same as S\u0304(zi\u22121 , zi ; Y0 ).\nIn what follows, we shall exploit the evolution of the probabilities PN (Y \u2212 Y0 ) within the\ndipole picture in order to deduce a set of non\u2013linear evolution equations for the quantities\n26\n\n\fdefined in Eqs. (2.33)\u2013(2.34). To that aim, it is more convenient to use the original version\nof the equations for PN , due to Mueller [12]. Specifically, Mueller has derived an equation\nfor the following generating functional\nZxy [Y, u] =\n\n\u221e Z\nX\n\nN =1\n\nd\u0393N PN (z1 ...zN \u22121 ; Y ) u1 u2 * * * uN ,\n\n(2.35)\n\nwhere ui \u2261 u(zi\u22121 , zi ) is an arbitrary 'source' field, and (x, y) = (z0 , zN ), as usual. The\ndipole probabilities PN (Y ) can be deduced from Zxy [Y, u] by functionally differentiating\nwith respect to u and then letting u \u2192 0. The evolution equation satisfied by Zxy reads\n\u2202Zxy\n\u1fb1s Z\n=\nM(x, y, z) (\u2212Zxy + Zxz Zzy ) ,\n\u2202Y\n2\u03c0 z\n\n(2.36)\n\nto be solved with the following initial condition, which follows from Eq. (2.4) :\nZxy [0, u] = uxy .\n\n(2.37)\n\nAs demonstrated in Ref. [73], this non\u2013linear equation is equivalent with the infinite\nhierarchy of linear, master, equations for the probability densities PN [16], although the\nrespective pictures of the evolution are quite different: According to Eq. (2.36), the one\u2013\nstep evolution consists in the splitting of the original, high\u2013rapidity, dipole into two child\ndipoles, which then separately evolve and produce their own distribution of dipoles. By\ncontrast, the master equations of Ref. [16] focus on the splitting of the low\u2013rapidity dipoles\nproduced in the previous steps of the evolution.\nEq. (2.36) looks formally similar to the BK equation for the S\u2013matrix [10], and indeed\nthe latter can be easily derived from the former, as we show now: Eqs. (2.34) and (2.35)\nimply S\u0304(x, y; Y ) = Zxy [Y, s], which together with Eq. (2.36) immediately leads to (with\nthe simplified notation S\u0304xy \u2261 S\u0304(x, y; Y ))\n\u1fb1s\n\u2202 S\u0304xy\n=\n\u2202Y\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\nz\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nM(x, y, z) \u2212S\u0304xy + S\u0304xz S\u0304zy ,\n\n(2.38)\n\nwhich is the BK equation [5, 10], as anticipated. It is more customary to write this equation\nin terms of the scattering amplitude T\u0304xy \u2261 1 \u2212 S\u0304xy , in which case it reads:\n\u2202 T\u0304xy\n\u1fb1s\n=\n\u2202Y\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\nz\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nM(x, y, z) T\u0304xz + T\u0304zy \u2212 T\u0304xy \u2212 T\u0304xz T\u0304zy .\n\n(2.39)\n\nThe evolution of the diffractive probability (2.33) can be similarly addressed. Eqs. (2.33)\nand (2.35) imply (the dependence upon the rapidity gap Y0 is kept implicit, since this\nvariable is fixed in the following manipulations)\ndiff\nP\u0304xy\n(Y ) = 1 \u2212 2S\u0304xy (Y ) + Zxy [Y, s2 ]\n\n= \u22121 + 2T\u0304xy (Y ) + Zxy [Y, s2 ],\n27\n\n(2.40)\n\n\fwhere we have assumed that s is real, as appropriate at high energy. This rewriting of\ndiff\nP\u0304xy\ntogether with the previous equations (2.36) and (2.39) then imply\n\nZ\ndiff\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2202 P\u0304xy\n\u1fb1s\n=2\nM (x, y, z) T\u0304xz + T\u0304zy \u2212 T\u0304xy \u2212 T\u0304xz T\u0304zy\n\u2202Y\n2\u03c0 z\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u1fb1s\n\u2212\nM(x, y, z) Zxy [s2 ] \u2212 Zxz [s2 ]Zzy [s2 ]\n2\u03c0 z\n\u0012\nZ\n\u1fb1s\nM(x, y, z) 2T\u0304xz + 2T\u0304zy \u2212 2T\u0304xy \u2212 2T\u0304xz T\u0304zy\n=\n2\u03c0 z\ndiff\n\u2212(P\u0304xy\n\n+ 1 \u2212 2T\u0304xy ) +\n\ndiff\n(P\u0304xz\n\n+1\u2212\n\ndiff\n2T\u0304xz )(P\u0304zy\n\n+ 1 \u2212 2T\u0304zy )\n\n\u0013\n\n(2.41)\n\nAfter some simple manipulations, the expression in the r.h.s. can be recast into the form\n\n\u0012\nZ\ndiff\n\u2202 P\u0304xy\n\u1fb1s\ndiff\ndiff\ndiff\ndiff diff\n=\nM(x, y, z) P\u0304xz\n+ P\u0304zy\n\u2212 P\u0304xy\n+ P\u0304xz\nP\u0304zy\n\u2202Y\n2\u03c0 z\n\u0013\n\ndiff\ndiff\n\u22122T\u0304xz P\u0304zy\n\u2212 2P\u0304xz\nT\u0304zy + 2T\u0304xz T\u0304zy ,\n\n(2.42)\n\nwhich is recognized, as anticipated, as the equation proposed by Kovchegov and Levin\n[44]. It is interesting to notice that, in Ref. [44], this equation has been obtained by\nworking in the target rest frame, which required a more intricate analysis of the final\nstate interactions.\nThe non-linear terms in Eqs. (2.39) and (2.42) describe (incoherent) multiple scattering\nbetween the dipoles in the projectile and the color fields in the target and are responsible\nfor unitarization: In the high energy limit, the solutions T\u0304 (Y ) and P\u0304diff (Y, Y0 ) approach\nthe 'black\u2013disk' fixed points T\u0304 = P\u0304diff = 1, in agreement with the corresponding properties\nof the more general formulae (2.3) and (2.9).\nBut although they do respect the unitarity bounds, Eqs. (2.39) and (2.42) cannot be\nused in a study of the high\u2013energy limit, because of the mean field approximation (2.32)\ninherent in their derivation and which fails at high energy [1, 2]. To properly include the\nrelevant fluctuations, one must replace the BK equation with the hierarchy of Pomeron\nloop equations [4, 14] for the N\u2013dipole amplitudes hS(1)S(2) * * * S(N)iY . Once these amplitudes are thus computed, they can be used to evaluate the diffractive probability according to Eq. (2.3), which replaces the solution to the KL equation for sufficiently high\nenergy. Although the general solution to the Pomeron loop equations is not known, the\ncorrespondence between high\u2013energy QCD and problems in statistical physics [3, 33] has\nallowed one to deduce valuable information about the behaviour of the dipole amplitudes\nin the high\u2013energy limit [2\u20134]. This will be explained in the next section.\n28\n\n\f3\n\nDipole amplitudes at high energy: Fluctuations & Diffusive scaling\n\nThe essential ingredient required by a calculation of the various scattering probabilities\nintroduced in the previous section are the N\u2013dipole amplitudes hT (N ) iY which describe the\nscattering between the target and a system of dipoles. In this section, we shall describe the\ncalculation of these amplitudes in the high\u2013energy regime where the MFA breaks down,\nbecause of the strong influence of gluon\u2013number fluctuations [2\u20134].\nMost of the results to be presented below have already appeared in Refs. [2\u20134], but\nsince these are recent developments and, moreover, are of utmost importance for the\npresent analysis, our respective discussion here will be quite complete. In doing so, we\nshall also clarify some points which have not been addressed in the previous studies,\nlike the borderline between the intermediate\u2013energy regime, where the BK equation is\na reasonable approximation and geometric scaling applies, and the high\u2013energy regime,\nwhere the evolution is dominated by fluctuations leading to diffusive scaling.\nThe subsequent picture will be given in a frame in which all of the energy is carried\nby the hadronic target, so the projectile is a bare dipole, or a set of few such dipoles.\nTo compute a target\u2013averaged amplitude like hT (N ) iY , one needs to (i) evaluate the\nscattering amplitude TY (x, y) for a single dipole and in a single event (meaning, for a\ngiven configuration of the gluon fields in the target, as generated through a single evolution\nfrom y = 0 up to y = Y ) and (ii) average the result over the ensemble of events (that\nis, over all the possible target evolutions from y = 0 to y = Y ). It turns out that, for\nsufficiently large values of Y , both these operations become relatively simple and their\nresults are universal (i.e., independent of the initial conditions at low energy), as they are\nfully determined by the quantum evolution with Y [2\u20134]. In fact, this universality is even\nstronger, in the sense that the details of the evolution matter for a couple of parameters\nwhich enter the final results (namely, the coefficients \u03bb and Dfr which appeared in the\nIntroduction), but not for the functional form of the average amplitudes [4].\n\n3.1\n\nThe event\u2013by\u2013event dipole amplitude\n\nFrom now on, we shall neglect any non\u2013trivial dynamics in the impact parameter space,\nthat is, we shall assume that the evolution with increasing energy is quasi\u2013local in b and we\nshall often omit the b\u2013argument from the amplitudes. This is a reasonable approximation\nso long as one is interested (as we are here) in the high\u2013energy limit of the DIS cross\u2013\nsections at fixed impact parameter. Then, the dipole amplitude in a single event can be\nwritten as\nTY (x, y) \u2261 TY (r) \u2261 TY (\u03c1)\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere r = |x \u2212 y| is the dipole size and \u03c1 represents r in logarithmic units, like in Fig.\n1 : \u03c1 \u2261 ln(1/r 2 Q20 ), with Q0 a scale of reference introduced by the initial conditions at\nlow energy. Note that large \u03c1 corresponds to small dipole sizes, or to large transverse\n2\nmomenta (\u03c1 \u223c ln k\u22a5\n) after a Fourier transform.\n29\n\n\fFor sufficiently high energy, the amplitude takes the form of a traveling wave [33] :\nTY (\u03c1) \u2243 T (\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1s (Y )) .\n\n(3.2)\n\nThis is a front which interpolates between a strong scattering regime at \u03c1 < \u03c1s (Y ), where\nthe unitarity bound T = 1 has been saturated, and a weak scattering regime at \u03c1 > \u03c1s (Y ),\nwhere TY \u226a 1, and which propagates towards larger values of \u03c1 when increasing Y . Here,\n\u03c1s (Y ) is the position of the front - conventionally defined as the dipole size \u03c1 for which\nT (\u03c1) = 1/2 - and it increases linearly with Y : \u03c1s (Y ) \u2243 \u03bb\u1fb1s Y . The position of the front\nalso serves as a definition for the target saturation momentum :\n\u0010\n\n\u03c1s (Y ) \u2261 ln Q2s (Y )/Q20\n\n\u0011\n\n=\u21d2 Q2s (Y ) \u2243 Q20 e\u03bb\u1fb1s Y .\n\n(3.3)\n\nAccordingly, \u03bb will be alternatively referred to as the saturation exponent, or the front\nvelocity. The BK equation (2.39) predicts \u03bb = \u03bb0 \u2248 4.88 [61, 62], but this result is significantly lowered by gluon number fluctuations [2, 3] (see below) and also by the next\u2013to\u2013\nleading order corrections in perturbative QCD [63].\nWe shall also need later some analytic control over the shape of an individual front. As\nindicated in Eq. (3.2), this depends only upon the difference \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1s (Y ), meaning that\nthe front propagates without distortion: in a co\u2013moving frame, the shape of the front\nis independent of Y . This property has been first noticed within the framework of the\nmean field approximation, that is, for the solution to the BK equation [33, 61, 62, 80\u201384],\nbut for the individual fronts this remains true also in the presence of fluctuations [3, 66].\nSince \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1s = ln(1/r 2 Q2s ), we deduce that the dipole amplitude TY (r) depends upon\nits two kinematical variables r and Y only trough the dimensionless product r 2 Q2s (Y ) -\nthe property usually referred to as geometric scaling [33, 60\u201363]. This property has far\nreaching physical consequences, as it provides a natural explanation [61] for a new scaling\nbehaviour observed in the small\u2013x data at HERA [60] and plays also an essential role in\nunderstanding the particle production in deuteron\u2013gold collisions at RHIC [85, 86]. Note,\nhowever, that the quantity which matters for the calculation of physical observables is\nthe target\u2013averaged dipole amplitude hT (\u03c1)iY and, as we shall later explain, the geometric scaling property characteristic of a single event does not necessarily translate to the\naverage quantities, because of fluctuations [2\u20134].\nThe fluctuations are inherent in the evolution with increasing energy, because the instantaneous configuration of the gluons in the target (as probed by the external dipole) can\nabruptly change from one rapidity step to another via the emission of new gluons. At\nhigh energy, the fluctuations are relatively important only in the dilute regime at large\ntransverse momenta (k\u22a5 \u226b Qs ), where the gluon occupation numbers are small. Since the\nhigh\u2013k\u22a5 gluons scatter preponderantly with small dipoles, of size r \u223c 1/k\u22a5 , we deduce\nthat the fluctuations should significantly affect only the tail of the dipole amplitude TY (\u03c1)\nat large values of \u03c1. Simple physical considerations [3, 66] (see also below) show that the\nfluctuations have a relatively small effect on the overall shape of an individual front -\nthey modify only the foremost part of the front, where T is very small: T \u223c \u03b1s2 -, but\nthey strongly influence the dynamics of the front, thus considerably reducing its velocity\n\u03bb with respect to the mean field prediction \u03bb0 . This behaviour, which is confirmed by\nnumerical simulations within both QCD and statistical physics (see, e.g., [28, 29, 66, 87]),\n30\n\n\freflects the pulled nature of the saturation front: the propagation is entirely driven by the\ndynamics in the tail of the front at \u03c1 \u226b \u03c1s (Y ), and thus is very sensitive to even small\nchanges in this tail due to fluctuations.\nReturning to a discussion of the shape of the front, it is important to stress here (in\nanticipation of Sect. 3.2) that, in order to compute the average amplitudes at high energy,\none needs only a very limited information about the shape of the individual fronts: it\nis in fact enough to know that TY (\u03c1) = 1 for \u03c1 < \u03c1s (Y ) [4]. But precisely in order to\ndevelop the corresponding argument in Sect. 3.2, and also in view of numerical tests in\nthe forthcoming sections, we shall need to know a little bit more about the function\nTY (\u03c1). Specifically, the following piecewise approximation, which can be inferred from the\nrelevant literature [3, 66, 67], will be sufficient for our purposes:\n\nT (z) =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\nfor z < 0\n\nA e\u2212\u03b30 z\n\nfor 1 < z < L\n\nB e\u2212z\n\nfor L \u226a z.\n\n(3.4)\n\nHere, z \u2261 \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1s is the scaling variable, A and B are undetermined normalization factors,\n\u03b30 \u2248 0.63, and L is the 'width of the front', namely, the distance \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1s over which the\namplitude falls off from its saturation value T = 1 to a value of order \u03b1s2 , where the\nfluctuations become important. This condition immediately yields:\nL \u2243\n\n1\n1\nln 2 + O(1) .\n\u03b30\n\u03b1s\n\n(3.5)\n\nNote that the physical regions in which the solution is approximately given have no overlap\nwith each other, so, not surprisingly, the expressions shown in Eq. (3.4) do not provide\na continuous interpolation for T (z). The first line in Eq. (3.4) is, clearly, the saturation\nregion ; the second line describes the front of the traveling wave, with the characteristic\n'anomalous dimension' 1 \u2212 \u03b30 \u2248 0.37 which is a hallmark of the BFKL evolution in the\npresence of saturation [61, 62]; finally, the third line represents the perturbative QCD tail,\nwhere the amplitude exhibits color transparency (T (r) \u223c r 2 ), and which is generated via\nthe large\u2013\u03c1 behaviour of the BFKL kernel. More precisely, within the BFKL evolution,\nthe color transparency is amended by quantum corrections in the \"double\u2013logarithmic\napproximation\" (DLA). These are not explicitly shown here, since the contribution of\nthis large\u2013\u03c1 tail to physical quantities is anyway negligible in the high\u2013energy regime of\ninterest. It is however important to notice that such DLA effects violate geometric scaling,\nwhich is therefore restricted to the region at z <\n\u223c L.\nThe single\u2013event amplitude in Eq. (3.4) looks quite similar to the solution to the BK\nequation (see, e.g., Ref. [86]), but it differs from the latter in two essential points:\n\na) The front is compact in Eq. (3.4), i.e., it has a finite width L which is independent\nof Y .\n\u221a\nBy contrast, the front of the BK solution extends up to distances \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1s \u223c Y , and thus\nits width increases with Y . In the context of the BK equation, this front is often referred\nto as the geometric scaling window [61, 62]. We see that, as a consequence of fluctuations,\nthe width of the geometric scaling window for a single event (and for sufficiently high\n31\n\n\fenergy) is considerably reduced with respect to the mean field approximation.\nb) The front velocity \u03bb which enters Eq. (3.4) via \u03c1s is considerably smaller than the\ncorresponding BK velocity \u03bb0 . This is seen numerically for generic values of \u03b1s , and is\nconfirmed by an analytic calculation valid in the weak coupling limit \u03b1s2 \u2192 0, which shows\nthat in this limit \u03bb converges towards \u03bb0 , but only very slowly [2, 3, 66] :\n\u03bb \u2243 \u03bb0 \u2212\n\nC\nln (1/\u03b1s2)\n2\n\nwhen \u03b1s2 \u226a 1 .\n\n(3.6)\n\nHere, C is a known number, which is determined by the linear, BFKL, dynamics and turns\nout to be quite huge : C = \u03c0 2 \u03b30 \u03c7\u2032\u2032 (\u03b30 ) \u2248 150. (Here, \u03c7(\u03b3) is the Mellin transform of the\nBFKL kernel [2, 3]. Note also that \u03bb0 = \u03c7(\u03b30 )/\u03b30 \u2248 4.88.) The tendency of \u03bb to decrease\nwhen increasing \u03b1s2 is also confirmed by a study of the 'strong noise limit', which shows\nthat in that limit \u03bb vanishes as a power of 1/\u03b1s2 [88].\nMore precisely, the above picture applies only for high enough rapidities, larger than the\nformation time of the front, estimated as [3, 89] :\n\u1fb1s Yform \u223c\n\nln2 (1/\u03b1s2)\n.\n2\u03c7\u2032\u2032 (\u03b30 ) \u03b302\n\n(3.7)\n\nThis is the rapidity evolution necessary for the front to reach its final form in Eq. (3.4),\nand for the velocity to reach its asymptotic value in Eq. (3.6), starting with some generic\ninitial condition\nat Y = 0. For Y < Yform , the width of the front increases with Y as\n\u221a\n\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1s \u223c Y , via BFKL diffusion, while for Y > Yform , this width gets stuck at its\nmaximal value, equal to L. As indicated by the 'geometric scaling' region in the diagram\nin Fig. 1, a similar behaviour is shown also by the average amplitude hT (\u03c1)iY , but only\nup to some maximal rapidity Y \u223c YDS , beyond which the effects of fluctuations become\noverwhelming (see the discussion in the next subsection).\nLet us conclude this presentation with a few physical considerations on the role of fluctuations [3]. The previous arguments exhibit the special role played by the parameter \u03b1s2\nin the study of fluctuations (in particular, the mean field limit is obtained as \u03b1s2 \u2192 0),\nand this deserves a comment. In the dilute regime where the fluctuations are important,\nand for large Nc , the target itself can be described as a collection of dipoles, and then\nthe amplitude T (r) describes the scattering between the external dipole r and the target\ndipoles. The dipole\u2013dipole amplitude T (r, r \u2032 ) is of order \u03b1s2 and is peaked at sizes r \u2032 \u223c r.\nHence, to a good approximation, T (r) \u223c \u03b1s2 f (r), where f (r) is the dipole occupation number in the target, that is, the number of dipoles with size r (per unit of ln 1/r 2 ) within an\narea r 2 around the impact parameter of the external dipole. In a given event, f is discrete\n(f = 0, 1, 2, . . . ), so the scattering amplitude takes on only discrete values, which are\nmultiples of \u03b1s2 . In particular, the minimal non\u2013zero value for T is \u03b1s2 , showing that the\ntail of the front must abruptly end when T becomes of O(\u03b1s2 ). This explains the compact\nnature of the front.\n\u221a\nFurthermore, the particle number\nfluctuations\nfollow\na\nnormal\ndistribution:\n\u03b4f\n\u223c\nf,\nq\n\u221a\n2\n2\nshowing that \u03b4T \u223c \u03b1s f \u223c \u03b1s T . Thus, the mean field approximation becomes reliable,\nin the sense that \u03b4T \u226a T , as soon as T \u226b \u03b1s2 . In particular, this becomes a good\n32\n\n\fapproximation everywhere (i.e., for any r) in the limit \u03b1s2 \u2192 0.\n3.2\n\nFront dispersion through fluctuations\n\nLet us consider now the average over the target wavefunction, which in the present context\namounts to an average over the statistical ensemble of fronts : the fronts associated to all\nthe possible evolutions of the target over a rapidity interval Y . It turns out that at high\nenergy - sufficiently high for the fronts to reach their canonical form, cf. Eq. (3.7) - this\naveraging is quite simple: Since all the fronts in the ensemble have the same shape, they\ncan differ from each other only by a translation. That is, the only random variable in the\nproblem is the position \u03c1s of the front, which can be argued to be distributed according\nto the following, Gaussian, probability density [3, 66, 67]\n1\n(\u03c1s \u2212 h\u03c1s i)2\nPY (\u03c1s ) = \u221a\nexp \u2212\n.\n\u03c0\u03c3\n\u03c32\n\"\n\n#\n\n(3.8)\n\nIn this equation, h\u03c1s i \u2243 \u03bb\u1fb1s Y is the average position of the front and increases with Y\nwith the velocity shown in Eq. (3.6), since this is the common average velocity for all the\nfronts in the ensemble. Furthermore, \u03c3 2 /2 \u2261 h\u03c12s i \u2212 h\u03c1s i2 is the front dispersion, which\nrises linearly with Y , \u03c3 2 (Y ) \u2243 Dfr \u1fb1s Y , since the stochastic process is a random walk\naround the average front 10 . It has been first suggested by numerical simulations [66], and\nvery recently confirmed through analytic arguments [67] that, in the weak coupling limit\n\u03b1s2 \u2192 0, the front diffusion coefficient Dfr scales as\nDfr \u2243\n\nD\nln (1/\u03b1s2 )\n3\n\nwhen \u03b1s2 \u226a 1 .\n\n(3.9)\n\nThis vanishes, as expected, in the mean field limit \u03b1s2 \u2192 0, but only very slowly. The\ncoefficient D has been explicitly computed in Ref. [67]. (Once again, this is determined\nby the linear dynamics in the tail.)\nThen the average amplitude hT iY is determined by\nhT (\u03c1)iY =\n\nZ\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nd\u03c1s PY (\u03c1s ) T (\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1s ),\n\n(3.10)\n\nwith T (\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1s ) the single\u2013event front in Eq. (3.4). Higher\u2013point correlations can be computed similarly. Note that the ensuing average amplitudes will naturally depend upon the\ndifference z \u2261 \u03c1 \u2212 h\u03c1s i, but they will also show additional dependencies upon Y , via the\nfront dispersion \u03c3. That is, unlike the individual fronts, the average amplitudes will generally not show geometric scaling [2, 3]. In fact, as we shall shortly discover, at sufficiently\nhigh energies the geometric scaling is replaced by a new, diffusive, scaling.\n10\n\nNote that our present normalizations for the coefficients \u03bb and Dfr differ by a factor \u1fb1s from\nthose used in the Introduction.\n\n33\n\n\fGiven the Gaussian nature of the probability distribution (3.8), it is straightforward to\ncompute the average in Eq. (3.10) for the piecewise\u2013defined front in Eq. (3.4), and we\nshall do so indeed in the more detailed studies in the next subsections. Here, however,\nwe would like to point out (following an original analysis in Ref. [4]) that, for sufficiently\nhigh energy, the dominant contributions to the average amplitudes hT (N ) iY with any N\nare given by the saturation region in Eq. (3.4), and thus they are all expressed through a\nuniversal function.\nLet us start by better specifying what we mean by \"sufficiently high energy\" : As anticipated in the Introduction (cf. Fig. 1), this is the regime in which the target expectation\nvalues are dominated by dense fluctuations, which in turn requires relatively high values\nof Y and not too large values of \u03c1 (but \u03c1 can still be much larger than the average saturation scale h\u03c1s i; see below). More precisely, we shall demonstrate here that within the\nhigh\u2013energy regime defined as\nHigh\u2013energy regime\n\n\u21d0\u21d2\n\n\u03c3 \u226b 1/\u03b30\n\nand \u03c1 \u2212 h\u03c1s i \u226a \u03b30 \u03c3 2 ,\n\n(3.11)\n\nthe dominant contributions to the average dipole amplitudes can be simply computed\nwith a \u0398\u2013function saturation front:\nT\u03b8 (\u03c1) \u2261 \u0398(\u03c1s \u2212 \u03c1) ,\n\n(3.12)\n\nwhich in turn implies [4]\nhT (\u03c1)iY\n\n1\nz\n= Erfc\n2\n\u03c3\n\n\u0012 \u0013\n\n,\n\n(3.13)\n\nand, more generally,\nhT (\u03c11 )T (\u03c12 ) * * * T (\u03c1N )iY =\n\n1\nz>\nErfc\n2\n\u03c3\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(3.14)\n\nwhere z = \u03c1 \u2212 h\u03c1s i and z> = \u03c1> \u2212 h\u03c1s i, with \u03c1> = the largest among the \u03c1i 's. In these\nequations, Erfc(x) is the complementary error function,\n2\nErfc(x) \u2261 \u221a\n\u03c0\n\nZ\u221e\n\n2\n\ndt e\u2212t ,\n\n(3.15)\n\nx\n\nwhich arises here as the integral of the probability density (3.8) over all values of \u03c1s larger\nthan \u03c1 (respectively, \u03c1> ): The r.h.s. of Eq. (3.13) is simply the probability to find a front\nwhich is at saturation on the resolution scale \u03c1.\nEqs. (3.13)\u2013(3.14) show that the average scattering amplitudes at high energy are dominated by those fronts within the statistical ensemble at Y which are at saturation at the\nhighest resolution scale \u03c1> set by the incoming projectile. This is true, in particular, for\nrelatively large values of \u03c1, well above h\u03c1s i, where on the average the scattering is weak,\nhT (\u03c1)iY \u226a 1, yet this average value is dominated by the relatively rare configurations\n('black spots') which are at saturation for that (large) value of \u03c1. The subdominant con34\n\n\ftributions not shown in Eqs. (3.13)\u2013(3.14) are suppressed by, at least, one power of 11 1/\u03c3\nand/or z/\u03c3 2 (respectively, z> /\u03c3 2 ), and are sensitive to the detailed shape of the single\u2013\nevent front. A similar sensitivity holds for the average amplitudes outside the high\u2013energy\nregime defined in Eq. (3.11).\nNote that the universal behaviour exhibited in Eqs. (3.13)\u2013(3.14) emerges also in the limit\nof strong fluctuations, as recently shown in Ref. [88]. This observation is consistent with\nthe analysis in Ref. [4] and the present considerations, since the limit of strong fluctuations\nis formally obtained by letting \u03c3 \u2192 \u221e within our formulae, in which case the 'high\u2013energy\nregime' of Eq. (3.11) extends everywhere.\nTo demonstrate the above results, we need to study the influence of the shape of the front\non the average amplitudes with increasing energy. To that aim, it is sufficient to consider\nthe following, simplified, profile for an individual event :\nT\u03b3 (\u03c1) = \u0398(\u03c1s \u2212 \u03c1) + \u0398(\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1s ) e\u2212\u03b3(\u03c1\u2212\u03c1s ) .\n\n(3.16)\n\nFor \u03b3 = \u03b30 \u2248 0.63, this simulates the front region in the second line of Eq. (3.4), while\nfor \u03b3 = 1 it rather corresponds to the 'color transparency' region in the third line there.\nBy using Eqs. (3.16) and (3.8) it is straightforward to deduce\n1\n1\nz\n\u03b3 2 \u03c32\nhT (z)iY = Erfc\n+ exp\n\u2212 \u03b3z\n2\n\u03c3\n2\n4\n\u0012 \u0013\n\n!\u0014\n\n\u03b3\u03c3\nz\n2 \u2212 Erfc\n\u2212\n\u03c3\n2\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\n,\n\n(3.17)\n\nwith z = \u03c1\u2212h\u03c1s i. The first term is the same as in Eq. (3.13) and comes from the saturation\npiece of T\u03b3 , while the second term comes from the exponential piece of Eq.

By using Eqs. (3.17)\u2013\n(3.18) one finds that the average amplitude retains its single event profile, except in the\nshort interval |z| <\n\u223c \u03c3 where it gets smoothed:\nhT (z)iY =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f21\n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3e\u2212\u03b3z\n\nfor z \u226a \u2212\u03c3,\nfor \u03c3 \u226a z,\n\nfor \u03c3 \u226a 1/\u03b3 .\n\n(3.19)\n\nIn this regime, geometric scaling is manifest at the level of the average amplitudes. The\nsituation is similar to the mean field approximation, except for the facts that the real front\nis compact and has a smaller velocity, cf. Eq. (3.6). (The compactness becomes manifest,\n11\n\nSuch estimates should more properly read, e.g., z/\u03b30 \u03c3 2 , but here and in what follows we shall\noften use the fact that \u03b30 \u2248 0.63 is a number of O(1) to simplify the parametric estimates.\n\n35\n\n\fof course, only if one starts with the more realistic profile in Eq. (3.4).) We thus conclude\n\nNegligible dispersion\n\n\u21d0\u21d2\n\n\u03c3 \u226a 1/\u03b30\n\n\u21d0\u21d2\n\n\u1fb1s Y \u226a\n\nln3 (1/\u03b1s2)\n.\n\u03b302 D\n\n(3.20)\n\nThe upper limit above, namely \u1fb1s YDS \u223c ln3 (1/\u03b1s2), is parametrically larger than the\n'critical' rapidity \u1fb1s Yc \u223c ln(1/\u03b1s2 ) for the onset of the unitarity corrections, cf. Eq. (2.13),\nand also than the formation time \u1fb1s Yform \u223c ln2 (1/\u03b1s2 ), cf. Eq. (3.7), for the individual\nfronts (as it should for the present discussion to make sense).\nii) For \u03c3 \u226b 1/\u03b3, the first term in Eq. (3.17) dominates everywhere except at extremely\n2\nlarge distances ahead of the front, such that z >\n\u223c \u03b3\u03c3 . For instance, in the interesting\nrange \u03c3 \u226a z \u226a \u03b3\u03c3 2 , where the average amplitude is small, we obtain\n1 \u03c3\n\u2243 \u221a\n2 \u03c0 z\n\nhT (z)iY\n\n(\n\n2z\n1+\n\u03b3\u03c3 2\n\n)\n\ne\u2212z\n\n2 /\u03c3 2\n\nfor \u03c3 \u226a z \u226a \u03b3\u03c3 2 ,\n\n(3.21)\n\nwhere the first term inside the curly brackets comes from the 'saturation' piece in the\nr.h.s. of Eq. (3.17), while the second term corresponds to the 'exponential' piece there,\nand is suppressed with respect to the first term by a factor z/\u03b3\u03c3 2 \u226a 1, as anticipated.\nOne can similarly check that Eq. (3.14) yields indeed the dominant behaviour for the\nN\u2013dipole amplitude hT (N ) iY within the range specified by Eq. (3.11).\nOn the other hand, it is easy to check that, for much larger values of \u03c1, such that z \u226b\n\u03c3 2 , the dominant contribution to the average amplitude comes from the second term in\nEq. (3.17), that is, from the exponential tail in Eq. (3.16). One then finds\nhT (z)iY\n\n\u03b3 2\u03c32\n\u2243 exp(\u2212\u03b3z) exp\n4\n\n!\n\nfor z \u226b \u03c3 2 ,\n\n(3.22)\n\nwhere we recognize the same exponential decay with \u03c1 as for a single front, Eq. (3.16).\nThe piecewise expression of the average amplitude at high energy reads therefore\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2(1/2)Erfc(z/\u03c3)\n\nhT (z)iY = \uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\n\u2212z\n\n\u223c e\n\nfor \u2212\u221e < z \u226a \u03b30 \u03c3 2 ,\n2\n\nfor \u03b30 \u03c3 \u226a z,\n\nfor \u03c3 \u226b 1/\u03b30 ,\n\n(3.23)\n\nwhere we have directly considered the more realistic profile in Eq. (3.4), so the exponential\ntail at very large z is determined by the 'color transparency' piece of Eq. (3.4).\nFor all but very large values of z, the average front profile in Eq. (3.23) has no resemblance\nat all with the single\u2013event profile in Eq. (3.4): There is no trace of the BFKL 'anomalous\ndimension' \u03b30 , nor of 'geometric scaling'. Rather, so long as z \u226a \u03b30 \u03c3 2 , the average amplitude obeys a new type of scaling - it scales as a function of z/\u03c3 - which was previously\nobserved in Refs. [3, 4], and for which we propose the name of diffusive scaling . Note\nthat the kinematical region for diffusive scaling coincides with the high\u2013energy regime of\nEq. (3.11), and is represented as the region at Y > YDS and \u03c1 at the left of the curve\n\"Q2d \" in Fig. 1.

The same as in Fig. 10 as a function of the \"diffusive\" scaling variable\nz = \u2212 ln(r 2 hQ2s i)/\u03c3. As \u03c3 increases the amplitude approaches the limiting behavior in Eq. (3.13).\n\naverage amplitude decreases as a Gaussian in z = \u03c1 \u2212 h\u03c1s i, and not as an exponential (as\nit happens for the single\u2013event front within the geometric scaling window).\nThis behaviour is illustrated in Figs. 10 and 11, which show the average amplitude in\nEq. (3.17) for \u03b3 = 1 and various values of \u03c3, as a function of either the 'geometric scaling'\nvariable r 2 hQ2s i (in Fig. 10), or the 'diffusive scaling' variable z = ln(1/r 2hQ2s i)/\u03c3 (in Fig.\n11). The \"mean field\" curve in Fig. 10 represents the limit \u03c3 \u2192 0, that is, the single\u2013event\n37\n\n\fprofile in Eq. (3.16). This shows geometric scaling, and would be the actual behaviour in\nthe absence of fluctuations. As manifest on Figs. 10 and 11, when increasing \u03c3, the average\namplitude deviates more and more from geometric scaling and eventually approaches the\nlimiting profile in Eq. (3.13) (displayed as the \"Erfc\" curve in Fig. 11), which shows\ndiffusive scaling.\nThese considerations show that the mean field approximations (like the BK equation)\ncompletely fail to describe the dipole scattering at high energy. This is particularly striking\nwhen one considers multi\u2013dipole correlations : in the high\u2013energy regime (3.11) these\ncorrelations are given by Eq. (3.14), which shows that the mean\u2013field factorization (2.32)\nis maximally violated. For instance, within the range \u03c3 \u226a z \u226a \u03c3 2 , the average amplitudes\nare weak, yet strongly correlated :\nD\n\nE\n\nD\n\nE\n\nhT (\u03c1)i \u2243 T 2 (\u03c1) \u2243 T N (\u03c1) \u2248\n\n1 \u03c3 \u2212z 2 /\u03c32\n\u221a\ne\n2 \u03c0 z\n\nfor \u03c3 \u226a z \u226a \u03c3 2 .\n\n(3.24)\n\nAccordingly, the N\u2013dipole amplitudes with enter the evolution equations with Pomeron\nloops become as important as the one\u2013dipole amplitude hT (\u03c1)iY already in the weak\nscattering regime, and not only in the region where the unitarity corrections are important.\nThis is so because the individual fronts which contribute to these average amplitudes are\nthemselves at saturation, and thus they are sensitive to unitarity corrections in the event\u2013\nby\u2013event description.\nThis dominance of saturated gluon configuration within the diffusive scaling region has\nanother interesting consequence, to which we shall refer as the rigidity of the average\namplitude: This is the property that, within the intermediate weak scattering regime at\n\u03c3 \u226a z \u226a \u03c3 2 , the average amplitude increases unusually slow when increasing Y at fixed\ndipole size (i.e., at fixed \u03c1). To better appreciate this property, recall first the rapid, BFKL,\nincrease of the average amplitude in the weak scattering regime at low and intermediate\nenergies, say, in the geometric scaling window (cf. Eqs. (1.1)):\n\u2202 hT (r)iY\n\u223c \u03b30 \u03bb\u1fb1s hT (r)iY\n\u2202Y\n\nr 2 hQ2s i \u226a 1 .\n\nwhen\n\n(3.25)\n\nOn the other hand, Eq. (3.13) implies\n!\n\nz\n1\n1 dz\nz d\u03c3\n\u2202 hT (r)iY\n= Erfc\u2032\n\u2212 2\n\u2202Y\n2\n\u03c3\n\u03c3 dY\n\u03c3 dY\n!\n\u0012\n\u0013\nDfr z\nz\nz2\n1\n\u221a\n= \u1fb1s \u03bb +\nexp \u2212 2 \u223c \u03bb\u1fb1s 2 hT (r)iY ,\n2\n2 \u03c3\n\u03c0\u03c3\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\n\u0012 \u0013\n\n(3.26)\n\nwhere we have used z = \u03c1 \u2212 h\u03c1s i, h\u03c1s i \u2243 \u03bb\u1fb1s Y and \u03c3 2 \u2243 Dfr \u1fb1s Y , and the last estimate\nholds for \u03c3 \u226a z \u226a \u03c3 2 (compare to Eq. (3.24)). Clearly, as compared to the intermediate\nenergy (or mean\u2013field) regime in Eq. (3.25), the relative variation of the high\u2013energy\namplitude in Eq. (3.26) is smaller by a factor z/\u03c3 2 \u226a 1. This is so since the individual\nfronts which contribute to hT (r)iY in this regime are all at saturation, so by themselves\nthey cannot increase when further increasing Y ; the comparatively slow growth visible in\nEq. (3.26) is rather due to the progression of the average front towards larger values of \u03c1.\n38\n\n\f4\n\nFluctuation effects on deep inelastic scattering at high energy\n\nIn this section, we shall consider the high\u2013energy limit of the inclusive and diffractive\ncross\u2013sections introduced in Sect. 2, with the purpose of demonstrating the fundamental\nchange of behaviour introduced in this regime by the gluon\u2013number fluctuations. On this\noccasion, we shall present the first calculation of the DIS cross\u2013sections including the\neffects of the Pomeron loops, and we shall compare our results with the corresponding\npredictions of the mean field approximation (the BK equation).\n4.1\n\nThe general set\u2013up\n\nTo perform this analysis, we need to complete our previous factorization formulae with\nthe electromagnetic vertex describing the dissociation of the virtual photon into a q q\u0304 pair.\nWithin the present, high\u2013energy, approximations, this vertex factorizes out and the DIS\ncross\u2013sections for the (inclusive and diffractive) \u03b3 \u2217 h scattering can be computed as [70, 71]\n\u03b3\nd\u03c3tot\n(Y, Q2 ) =\nd2 b\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\ndv\n\nZ\n\nd2 r\n\nX\n\n\u03b1=L,T\n\n|\u03c8\u03b1\u03b3 (v, r; Q)|2 Ptot (b, r; Y ),\n\n(4.1)\n\nand, respectively (recall that Ygap denotes the minimal rapidity gap),\nZ 1\nZ\n\u03b3\nX\nd\u03c3diff\n2\n2\n(Y,\nY\n,\nQ\n)\n=\ndv\nd\nr\n|\u03c8\u03b1\u03b3 (v, r; Q)|2 Pdiff (b, r; Y, Ygap ).\ngap\n2\nd b\n0\n\u03b1=L,T\n\n(4.2)\n\nIn these equations, |\u03c8T\u03b3 /L |2 are probability densities for the q q\u0304 dissociation of a virtual\nphoton with either transverse (T ) or longitudinal (L) polarization (these can be found\nin the literature and are displayed, for convenience, in Appendix A), r = x \u2212 y and\nb = (x + y)/2 are the transverse size and the impact parameter of the q q\u0304 pair, r \u2261 |r|,\nv is the fraction of the photon longitudinal momentum taken away by the quark, and\nPtot and Pdiff are the total and, respectively, diffractive probabilities for onium\u2013hadron\nscattering, as introduced in Eqs. (2.3) and (2.11).\nThe above formulae are a priori frame\u2013independent, but in order to be able to use our\nexpression (2.3) for Pdiff , we need to evaluate the diffractive cross\u2013section (4.2) in the\nframe where Y0 = Ygap . On the other hand, the inclusive cross\u2013section is most simply\nevaluated in the frame where Y0 = Y and the projectile is an elementary q q\u0304 pair:\nZ 1\nZ\n\u03b3\nX\nd\u03c3tot\n=\ndv\nd2 r\n|\u03c8\u03b1\u03b3 (v, r; Q)|2 2 Re hT (b, r)iY .\n2\nd b\n0\n\u03b1=L,T\n\n(4.3)\n\nThe factorization formula (4.2) holds within the same approximations as previously used\nin the calculation of Pdiff , namely, the leading logarithmic approximations with respect to\nboth ln(1/xP ) \u2261 Ygap and ln(1/\u03b2) \u2261 Y \u2212 Ygap . Under these assumptions, the diffractive\ncross\u2013section depends upon xP and \u03b2 only via the high\u2013energy evolutions of the target and\nthe projectile, respectively. In the high\u2013energy regime of interest, these approximations\n39\n\n\fare certainly correct in so far as the xP \u2013dependence is concerned (since xP is truly small),\nbut they fail to describe the actual \u03b2\u2013dependence in the vicinity of \u03b2 = 1 (i.e., in the\n2\ncase of a relatively small mass MX2 <\n\u223c Q for the diffractive system). In fact, within the\npresent approximations, the diffractive cross\u2013section for \u03b2 \u2243 1 reduces to its 'elastic' piece\nin Eqs. (2.1) and (2.2), which is independent of \u03b2. However, for \u03b2 \u2243 1, the projectile is\nsimply a q q\u0304 pair, and for that pair the generalization of Eq. (4.2) which provides the correct\n\u03b2\u2013dependence is known [36, 37] and will be exhibited in Appendix B (see Eq. (B.1)). It\nis therefore quite straightforward to improve the subsequent analysis in the vicinity of\n\u03b2 = 1, whenever this is needed. However, since our main interest here is rather in the\nhigh\u2013energy limit xP \u2192 0 at fixed \u03b2, we find it more convenient to focus on generic values\nof \u03b2 \u226a 1, for which the relatively simple factorization formula (4.2) applies as written.\ninel\nBy using Pdiff = Pel + Pdiff\n, cf. Eq. (2.18), it is further possible to separate the 'elastic'\nand 'inelastic' components of the diffractive cross\u2013section (4.2), as shown in Eq. (2.1).\nAlthough these components cannot be separately measured in DIS, as explained at the\nend of Sect. 2.1, this decomposition is still useful because, as we shall argue below, the\nelastic component dominates at high energy, up to relatively large values of Q2 (within\nthe region for diffusive scaling). Namely, we shall find that within the high\u2013energy region\ndefined by Eq. (3.11), the diffractive probability is predominantly elastic:\n\nPdiff (r; Y, Ygap) \u2243 Pel (r; Y )\n\nwhen \u03c3\u03b30 \u226b 1 and\n\nln\n\n1\nr 2 hQ2s i\n\n\u226a \u03c32.\n\n(4.4)\n\nSince, moreover, the convolutions with the virtual photon wavefunction in Eqs. (4.1) and\n(4.2) are dominated by dipole sizes r \u223c 1/Q within the whole kinematical region of interest\n(this will be explicitly checked below), the dominance of the elastic scattering extends to\nthe diffractive cross\u2013section, as anticipated :\n\u03b3\nd\u03c3diff\nd\u03c3el\u03b3\n2\n(Y,\nY\n,\nQ\n)\n\u2243\n(Y, Q2 )\ngap\nd2 b\nd2 b\n\nwhen \u03c3\u03b30 \u226b 1 and\n\nln\n\nQ2\n\u226a \u03c3 2 . (4.5)\nhQ2s i\n\nThis in turn implies that, within the present approximations at high energy, \u03c3diff is quasi\u2013\nindependent of the minimal rapidity gap Ygap and can be simply computed as the elastic\nscattering of the elementary q q\u0304 pair in the frame where Y0 = Y (cf. Eq. (2.10)):\nd\u03c3el\u03b3\n=\nd2 b\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\ndv\n\nZ\n\nd2 r\n\nX\n\n\u03b1=L,T\n\n|\u03c8\u03b1\u03b3 (v, r; Q)|2 | hT (b, r)iY |2 .\n\n(4.6)\n\nIn view of this and of Eq. (4.3), we conclude that, for sufficiently high energy and up\nto relatively large Q2 \u226b hQ2s i (cf. Eq. (4.5)), the calculation of both the inclusive and\nthe diffractive cross\u2013sections requires merely the knowledge of the forward amplitude\nhT (b, r)iY for the q q\u0304 pair in the frame where the target carries most of the total energy.\nThe dominance of the elastic over the inelastic scattering in diffractive DIS at large Q2\nand relatively small \u03b2 is an essential consequence of fluctuations - in the mean field\napproximation, the opposite situation holds ! [40, 50] -, and it might even seem counterintuitive at a first sight: At small \u03b2, the projectile contains many gluons, yet Eq. (4.4)\nimplies that the relative normalization of these many Fock states remains unchanged after\n40\n\n\fthe collision. But in view of the discussion in Sect. 3, this property is in fact natural, as\nwe explain now:\nNote first that Eq. (4.4) becomes natural in the saturation regime at r 2 hQ2s i \u226b 1, where\nPdiff and Pel attain their respective unitarity bounds: Pdiff = Pel = 1. In that regime, all\nthe Fock states in the projectile are equally absorbed, since they are completely absorbed.\n2\nThus, for low Q2 <\n\u223c hQs i at least, the inelastic diffraction is naturally suppressed. Now,\nin the discussion in Sect. 3 we have noticed the tendency of the fluctuations to 'push\u2013\nup the saturation physics', that is, to extend a behaviour which looks natural in the\nsaturation regime up to relatively large values of Q2 , within a distance ln(Q2 /hQ2s i) \u223c \u03c3 2\nabove the average saturation momentum which is fixed by the front dispersion. Physically,\nthis is so since, within the relevant region at large Q2 (the 'diffusive scaling' region),\nthe cross\u2013section is controlled by 'black spots' in the target wavefunction, i.e., by rare\ngluon configurations which are already at saturation. Hence, in any scattering event which\ncontributes significantly to the diffractive probability (2.3), the projectile with its all Fock\nspace components is completely absorbed - the diffraction is purely elastic ! -, and the\nreason where Pdiff is nevertheless smaller than one is just because the probability to find\nsuch a 'dense spot' is relatively small when Q2 \u226b hQ2s i.\ninel\nStill from the discussion in Sect. 3, we expect the inelastic probability Pdiff\nto be sup2\npressed with respect to the elastic one Pel by powers of 1/\u03c3 and/or z/\u03c3 , and this will\nbe indeed confirmed by the subsequent calculations. But although suppressed in so far as\nthe contribution to the cross\u2013section (4.2) - which, we recall, is 'inclusive' with respect\nto the rapidity gap (in the sense of including all the gap values from Ygap to Y ) - is\nconcerned, the inelastic diffraction represents the leading contribution to the differential\ncross\u2013section per unit rapidity gap at sufficiently small \u03b2 \u226a 1, and hence cannot be ignored when computing this particular quantity (even at very high energy). In fact, within\nthe present approximations, the contribution of the elastic scattering to the differential\ncross\u2013section d\u03c3diff /d ln(1/\u03b2) is a \u03b4\u2013function peaked at \u03b2 = 1. This contribution gets\nsmeared when going beyond the leading\u2013log approximation with respect to ln(1/\u03b2) (see\nEq. (B.1)), but is in any case localized near \u03b2 = 1; hence, for \u03b2 \u226a 1 we expect most of\nthe respective contribution to come from the inelastic diffraction:\n\u03b3\nd\u03c3diff\n\u2243\nd2 b d ln(1/\u03b2)\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\ndz\n\nZ\n\n2\n\nd r\n\nX\n\u03b1\n\n|\u03c8\u03b1\u03b3 (z, r; Q)|2\n\ninel\n\u2202Pdiff\n\u2212\n(b, r; Y, Ygap )\n\u2202Ygap\n\n!\n\nfor \u03b2 \u226a 1,\n(4.7)\n\nwhere in the r.h.s. Ygap \u2261 Y \u2212 ln(1/\u03b2).\nTo summarize, within the high\u2013energy regime specified in Eq. (4.5), the diffractive cross\u2013\nsection (4.2) is dominated by its elastic component and can be computed with the q q\u0304\npair alone (cf. Eqs. (4.5)\u2013(4.6)), so like the inclusive cross\u2013section (cf. Eq. (4.3)). But the\ncalculation of the inelastic diffraction is still necessary, for two reasons: (i) to explicitly\ncheck the dominance of the elastic over the inelastic diffraction, and (ii) to compute\nthe differential diffractive cross\u2013section (4.7) at small \u03b2 \u226a 1. Within the present apinel\nproximations, Pdiff\nis given by Eqs. (2.18) and (2.3) which, we recall, are valid so long\nas the saturation effects in the projectile wavefunction remain negligible (this requires\n\u1fb1s ln(1/\u03b2) \u226a ln(1/\u03b1s2 ), cf. Eq. (2.13)). For any \u03b2 satisfying this condition, Eq. (2.3) can\n41\n\n\fbe in principle computed by using the dipole probabilities PN obtained from Monte\u2013Carlo\nsimulations of the dipole picture [11] together with the dipole scattering amplitudes constructed in Sect. 3 (or, more generally, obtained by numerically solving the Pomeron loop\nequations [14]).\nBut in order to illustrate the main points of physics, it is preferable to use analytic calculations, and this is what we shall do in what follows. For these calculations to be tractable,\ninel\nwe shall restrict our computation of Pdiff\nto the simplest non\u2013trivial case - that where the\nonium wavefunction at the time of scattering contains only two components: a one\u2013dipole\nstate representing the original q q\u0304 pair, and a two\u2013dipole state corresponding to a q q\u0304g configuration. This is the physical situation in a frame in which the rapidity Y \u2212Y0 = ln(1/\u03b2)\nof the projectile is relatively large, so its high\u2013energy evolution cannot be neglected, but\nnot too large, so that one can restrict oneself to a single step in this evolution: the emission\nof one gluon with longitudinal momentum fraction \u03b2. This restriction on \u03b2 does not entail\nany serious loss of generality in so far as the proof of Eq. (4.5) is concerned - as previously explained, the dominance of elastic over inelastic diffraction at high energy follows\nfrom general arguments, and our subsequent calculation is merely intended to illustrate\nsuch arguments and to render them more quantitative. On the other hand, this restriction\nwould become of problem for phenomenological studies of diffraction at very small values\nof \u03b2; but in that case, it should be straightforward - at least, at conceptual level - to\nextend our analysis by using numerical simulations of the dipole picture within Eq. (2.3).\nNote that the q q\u0304 and the q q\u0304g components have been already included in previous studies\nof DIS in the presence of saturation [36, 37, 39\u201343, 45\u201347, 49, 50, 52\u201354], which were however based on the mean field approximation for the target correlations. The comparison\nbetween such previous studies in the literature and our subsequent results will make it\neasier to emphasize the role of the gluon\u2013number fluctuations at high energy.\nTo conclude this subsection, let us summarize here, for more clarity, the strategy that\nwe shall adopt in our analysis: In what follows, we shall evaluate the cross\u2013sections in\nEqs. (4.3), (4.6) and (4.7) (the latter, at the level of the q q\u0304g Fock state) by using the high\u2013\nenergy estimates (3.13)\u2013(3.14) for the dipole amplitudes. Note that, whereas the functional\nform of these amplitudes is universal (in the sense explained in the Introduction), the\ncoefficients \u03bb and Dfr which implicitly enter their expressions (via the Y \u2013dependencies of\nh\u03c1s i and \u03c3 2 ) are not : they depend upon the details of the QCD evolution, and presently\nthey are not well under control, except in the limit \u03b1s \u2192 0 (cf. Sect. 3.2). To avoid\nspecifying these parameters, we shall perform our subsequent analysis in terms of the\nvariables \u03c1 \u2212 h\u03c1s i and \u03c3. That is, we shall increase the energy by increasing the value of\n\u03c3, and we shall measure all dimensionful quantities, like r 2 or Q2 , in units of hQ2s i. This\nstrategy is physically meaningful, since the proper way to approach the \"high\u2013energy\nlimit\" is to simultaneously increase Y and Q2 , in such a way that the ratio Q2 /hQ2s i\nremains within the interesting scaling region in Fig. 1.\nTo better emphasize the effects of the fluctuations, we shall also estimate the relevant\nconvolutions with the following 'mean\u2013field' dipole amplitude\nT\u0304 (r, Y ) =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2(r 2 Q2s (Y ))\u03b3\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\n1\n\n42\n\nfor r \u2264 1/Qs (Y )\nfor r > 1/Qs (Y ),\n\n(4.8)\n\n\fwhich is representative for either the Golec-Biernat and W\u00fcsthoff (GBW) 'saturation\nmodel' [40] (in that case, \u03b3 = 1), or for the solution to the BK equation in the regime\nof geometric scaling (when \u03b3 = \u03b30 \u2248 0.63). More generally, for our present purposes, the\namplitude (4.8) is also representative for the actual situation in QCD at intermediate energies, that is, so long as the dispersion of the fronts remains negligible (cf. Eq. (3.20)). To\nstudy the transition between this regime and the high\u2013energy regime defined by Eq. (3.11),\nwhere the amplitude takes its \"error\u2013function\" form in Eq. (3.13), we shall perform numerical simulations with the dipole amplitude in Eq. (3.17). Indeed, the latter provides\na smooth interpolation between the mean\u2013field amplitude (4.8) at low energy (\u03c3 \u2192 0)\nand the error\u2013function amplitude (3.13) at high energy (\u03c3 \u2192 \u221e). In most of the explicit\ncalculations below, we shall choose \u03b3 = 1, for simplicity.\nTo obtain order\u2013of\u2013magnitude estimates in what follows, we shall rely on simplified versions of the convolutions appearing in Eqs. (4.1)\u2013(4.2), which in addition to being simpler,\nhave also the merit to clearly separate the physical origin of the various contributions.\nThe relevant simplifications exploit the properties of the \"virtual photon wavefunctions\"\n|\u03c8T\u03b3 /L |2 , as explained in the Appendix A. The ensuing, simplified, formulae read then\nZ\n\ndv d2 r |\u03c8T\u03b3 (v, r; Q)|2 f (r) \u223c \u03b1em Nc\n\nX\nf\n\n\uf8ee\n\ne2f \uf8f0\n\uf8ef\n\n2/Q\nZ\n0\n\ndr\n1\nf (r) + 2\nr\nQ\n\nZ\u221e\n\n2/Q\n\n\uf8f9\n\ndr\n\uf8fa\nf (r) \uf8fb ,\nr3\n\n(4.9)\n\nand, respectively,\nZ\n\ndv d2 r |\u03c8L\u03b3 (v, r; Q)|2 f (r) \u223c \u03b1em Nc\n\nX\nf\n\n\uf8ee\n\ne2f \uf8f0Q2\n\uf8ef\n\n2/Q\nZ\n\ndr rf (r) +\n\n0\n\n1\nQ4\n\nZ\u221e\n\n2/Q\n\n\uf8f9\n\ndr\n\uf8fa\nf (r)\uf8fb , (4.10)\nr5\n\nwhere in writing the r.h.s.'s we have kept the various parametric dependencies, but ignored all numerical factors. For each of these expressions, the first term within the square\nbrackets corresponds to the symmetric configurations, for which v \u223c 1/2 (in such configurations, the longitudinal momentum of the incoming photon is \"democratically\" divided\namong the quark and the antiquark), and the second one, to the aligned jet configurations, for which v is either close to zero, or close to one (either the quark, or the antiquark,\ncarries most of the total longitudinal momentum).\n4.2\n\nThe q q\u0304 component\n\nIn this subsection, we shall evaluate the DIS cross\u2013sections which can be computed from\nthe scattering of the q q\u0304 alone, namely, the inclusive cross\u2013section (4.3) and the elastic\ncomponent of the diffractive cross\u2013section, Eq. (4.6). As anticipated in the previous discussion, Eq. (4.6) is in fact the dominant contribution to the diffractive cross\u2013section (4.2)\nat high energy. Accordingly, the cross\u2013sections that we shall compute in this subsection\nrepresent our main results in this paper.\nTo render the subsequent discussion more intuitive, it is instructive to see the plots of the\nintegrands in Eqs. (4.3) and (4.6), as numerically computed with the two limiting expres43\n\n\fQ2 = 0.1 Q2s\n0.1\n\n10\n\nfluct (\u03c3 = 5), incl\nfluct (\u03c3 = 5), diff\nmean field, incl\nmean field, diff\n\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n0\n\nfluct (\u03c3 = 5), incl\nfluct (\u03c3 = 5), diff\nmean field, incl\nmean field, diff\n\n8\nintegrand\n\n0.08\nintegrand\n\nQ2 = 100 Q2s\n\n6\n4\n2\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\nrQs\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\nrQs\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\nFig. 12. The q q\u0304 contributions to the integrands in Eqs. (4.3) and (4.6) as computed with two\ndifferent expressions for the dipole amplitude - the mean\u2013field amplitude (4.8) with \u03b3 = 1\nand the 'fluctuation' amplitude (3.13) - are plotted as functions of rQs for two values of Q2 :\nQ2 = 0.1Q2s (left) and Q2 = 100Q2s (right).\n\nsions for the dipole amplitude: the high\u2013energy approximation (3.13) (the 'fluctuation'\npiece in the plots in Fig. 12) and the mean\u2013field model of Eq. (4.8) (with \u03b3 = 1 for definiteness). As manifest on Fig. 12, and it will be analytically demonstrated in what follows,\nthe strength of the integration is shifted towards smaller dipoles sizes after including the\neffects of fluctuations. This phenomenon becomes truly spectacular at high Q2 , where the\nintegrand corresponding to 'fluctuations' appears to be strongly peaked at r \u223c 2/Q (for\nboth inclusive and diffractive cross\u2013sections), while that for the mean field approximation\nis rather smoothly distributed at all sizes r >\n\u223c 2/Q (with only mild maxima at r \u223c 2/Q\nfor \u03c3tot and, respectively, at r \u223c 1/Qs for \u03c3diff ).\n4.2.1 The mean\u2013field approximation\nLet us first present the corresponding mean\u2013field estimates, which are well\u2013known (see,\ne.g., Refs. [39, 40, 54]), but are interesting here as a term of comparison with the forthcoming results which will include the effects of fluctuations. These estimates will be obtained\nhere by using the dipole amplitude (4.8) together with the approximations in Eqs. (4.9)\u2013\n(4.10). To avoid a proliferation of physical situations, we shall focus on the case Q2 \u226b Q2s ,\nwhere the contrast with the high energy behaviour turns out to be most important. For\nthat case, we shall distinguish between the total and the diffractive cross\u2013sections, and\nalso between transverse and longitudinal polarizations for \u03b3 \u2217 . To simplify writing, we shall\nP\nomit the overall factor \u03b1em Nc f e2f , which is common to all the cross\u2013sections.\ni) Total cross\u2013sections\n\nChoosing \u03b3 = 1 in Eq. (4.8), the transverse contribution to Eq. (4.3) is found as\nT\nd\u03c3tot\n\u223c\nd2 b\n\n2/Q\nZ\n0\n\ndr 2 2\n1\nr Qs + 2\nr\nQ\n\n1/Q\nZ s\n\n2/Q\n\ndr 2 2\n1\nr Qs + 2\n3\nr\nQ\n\n44\n\nZ\u221e\n\n1/Qs\n\nQ2s\nQ2\ndr\n,\n\u223c\nln\nr3\nQ2\nQ2s\n!\n\n(4.11)\n\n3\n\n\fwhere the dominant term, as isolated in the r.h.s., comes from the aligned\u2013jet configurations with dipole sizes r within the range 2/Q < r < 1/Qs . For the longitudinal sector,\none similarly obtains\nL\nd\u03c3tot\n\u223c Q2\n2\nd b\n\n2/Q\nZ\n\ndr r\n\n3\n\n0\n\nQ2s\n\n1/Q\nZ s\n\n1\n+ 4\nQ\n\n2/Q\n\ndr 2\n1\nQs + 4\n3\nr\nQ\n\nZ\u221e\n\n1/Qs\n\nQ2s\ndr\n\u223c\n,\nr5\nQ2\n\n(4.12)\n\nwhere the leading\u2013order term comes from dipole sizes r \u223c 1/Q, and it receives equally\nimportant contributions from both the symmetric and the aligned\u2013jet configurations.\nThe above results show that, at sufficiently large Q2 , the transverse sector dominates over\nthe longitudinal one, by a logarithm ln(Q2 /Q2s ). However, this dominance disappears at\nlower values of Q2 , within the geometric scaling window in Fig. 1. Indeed, in that regime\nT\nL\none must rather use \u03b3 = \u03b30 \u2248 0.63, and then one finds that both \u03c3tot\nand \u03c3tot\nare of the\nsame order, namely \u223c (Q2s /Q2 )\u03b30 , and they are dominated by dipole sizes r \u223c 1/Q.\nAfter similarly treating the case Q2 \u226a Q2s , one finds the following limiting behaviours for\nthe total \u03b3 \u2217 h cross\u2013section in this mean\u2013field scenario :\n\u03b3\nd\u03c3tot\nd2 b\n\n\u2248\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2ln(Q2s /Q2 )\n\nfor Q2 \u226a Q2s\n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3Q2 /Q2 ln(Q2 /Q2 )\ns\n\ns\n\n(4.13)\n\nfor Q2 \u226b Q2s .\n\nii) Diffractive cross\u2013sections\n\nThe diffractive cross\u2013section (4.6) involves the dipole amplitude squared, and this leads\nto important differences with respect to the inclusive cross\u2013section, at least in this mean\u2013\nfield scenario. The contribution of the small dipoles is now strongly suppressed, because\nT\u0304 2 \u2243 (r 2 Q2s )2\u03b3 for r \u226a 1/Qs . Accordingly, the dominant contribution to \u03c3diff comes from\nrelatively large dipole sizes, of the order of the saturation length: r \u223c 1/Qs [34, 35, 40, 68].\nTo see this, let us focus on the contribution of the aligned\u2013jet configurations within the\ntransverse sector (this turns out to be the dominant piece). The relevant integral reads\nT\n1\nd\u03c3diff\n\u223c 2\n2\nd b\nQ\n\nZ\u221e\n\n2/Q\n\ndr 2\n1\nT\u0304 \u223c 2\n3\nr\nQ\n\n1/Q\nZ s\n\n2/Q\n\ndr 2 2 2\u03b3\n1\n(r Qs ) + 2\n3\nr\nQ\n\nZ\u221e\n\n1/Qs\n\nQ2s\ndr\n\u223c\n,\nr3\nQ2\n\n(4.14)\n\nwhere for more clarity we have split the integration domain into two: 2/Q < r < 1/Qs\nand r > 1/Qs . It can be easily checked that, so long as \u03b3 > 1/2, both domains contribute\non equal footing to the leading order result \u223c Q2s /Q2 , which is generated by dipole sizes\nr \u223c 1/Qs , as anticipated. Indeed, the integral over the first domain is dominated by large\nvalues of r, of the order of the upper cutoff 1/Qs , while that over the second domain is\nsaturated by small values of r, close to the respective lower cutoff 1/Qs . By comparison,\nthe other contributions to diffraction - that of the symmetric transverse configurations,\nand the whole longitudinal contribution - are of 'higher\u2013twist order', that is, they are\nsuppressed by powers of Q2s /Q2 \u226a 1 with respect to the leading contribution (4.14).\nWe thus arrive at the (by now) standard picture of DIS diffraction in the presence of\n45\n\n\fsaturation [34, 35, 40], in which \u03c3diff is a leading\u2013twist quantity at high\u2013Q2 , so like the\ninclusive cross\u2013section (4.11). Accordingly, the ratio between the diffractive and the inclusive cross\u2013sections is only slowly varying with Q2 and with the total energy [40, 47]\n\nR \u2261\n\n(d\u03c3diff /d2 b)\n1\n\u223c\n,\n2\n2\n(d\u03c3tot /d b)\nln(Q /Q2s (Y ))\n\n(4.15)\n\n(this behaviour is illustrated by the 'mean\u2013field' curve in Fig. 17), in rough agreement\nwith the pattern observed in the corresponding HERA data at small x. This agreement\nhas represented one of the main successes of the saturation models applied to the phenomenology at HERA [40, 47].\nNotice the qualitative difference between the ways that the inclusive and diffractive cross\u2013\nsections get constructed - \u03c3tot receives leading\u2013twist contributions from all dipole sizes,\nwith a slight preference though for r \u223c 1/Q, whereas \u03c3diff is dominated by dipoles with\nr \u223c 1/Qs -, which nevertheless leads to quantitatively similar results (cf. Eq. (4.15)). For\nlater reference, let us display here the q q\u0304 contribution to the diffractive cross\u2013section in\nthe mean\u2013field approximation for both small and large Q2 :\nq q\u0304\nd\u03c3diff\nd2 b\n\n\u2248\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2ln(Q2s /Q2 )\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3Q2 /Q2\ns\n\nfor Q2 \u226a Q2s\n\n(4.16)\n\nfor Q2 \u226b Q2s .\n\nThe above results depend crucially upon the property of the mean\u2013field amplitude T\u0304 (r)\nto decrease very fast when decreasing r below 1/Qs : T\u0304 \u223c (r 2 Q2s )\u03b3 with \u03b3 > 1/2. From the\ndiscussion in Sect. 3, we know that this behavior is eventually washed out by fluctuations\nwhen increasing energy. As we shall shortly see, this change of behaviour has dramatic\nconsequences for the high\u2013energy limit of both inclusive and diffractive DIS cross\u2013sections.\n4.2.2 The high\u2013energy behaviour: 'black spots' and diffusive scaling\nWe now turn to the most interesting case for us here, namely the high\u2013energy regime of\nEq. (3.11). The kinematical region where the effects of the fluctuations are most visible,\nand that we shall concentrate on in what follows, is the high\u2013Q2 range defined by\n\u03c3(Y ) \u226b 1/\u03b30\n\nand\n\n\u03c3(Y ) \u226a Z \u2261 ln\n\nQ2\n\u226a \u03c3 2 (Y ) .\n2\nhQs i\n\n(4.17)\n\nFor much smaller Q2 , such that Q2 \u226a Q2s (Y ), the cross\u2013sections are dominated by 'saturated' dipoles with sizes r >\n\u223c 1/Qs , for which the mean field approximation works quite\n2\nwell. For much larger Q , such that Z \u226b \u03c3 2 (Y ), one enters the standard perturbative\nregime where the amplitudes show color transparency and evolve according to the DGLAP\nequation.\nWe shall soon verify that, within the interesting range (4.17), the convolutions yielding\nthe DIS cross\u2013sections are dominated by dipole sizes r \u223c 1/Q (at variance with the mean\nfield case, especially in the case of diffraction). It is therefore appropriate to evaluate\nthese convolutions with the expression (3.13) for the dipole amplitude, which is valid for\n46\n\n\fz \u226a \u03c3 2 (Y ). By using that, we shall be able to compute exactly the dominant behaviour\nof the cross\u2013sections at high energy. But before describing the exact calculations, we\nshall present some parametric estimates which have the merit to simply demonstrate the\nphysical points that we would like to emphasize here.\ni) Total cross\u2013sections\nWe start with the transverse sector and, for more clarity, we separate the respective\ncontributions of the symmetric and the aligned\u2013jet configurations:\nT\nd\u03c3tot\nT\n= Stot\n+ ATtot ,\n2\nd b\n\n(4.18)\n\nwhere (with z \u2261 ln(1/r 2 hQ2s i) ) :\nT\nStot\n\nATtot\n\n\u223c\n\n2/Q\nZ\n0\n\n1\n\u223c\nQ2\n\ndr\nhT (r)iY \u223c\nr\nZ\u221e\n\n2/Q\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nZ\n\ndz Erfc\n\ndr\nhT (r)iY \u223c e\u2212Z\nr3\n\nZ\n\nz\n\u03c3\n\n\u0012 \u0013\n\nZ\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n,\n\nz\n\n(4.19)\n\ndz e Erfc\n\nz\n.\n\u03c3\n\n\u0012 \u0013\n\n(4.20)\n\nConsider the large\u2013Q2 case, such that \u03c3 \u226a Z \u226a \u03c3 2 . It is then easy to verify that: (a)\nT\nthe integrals giving Stot\nand ATtot are dominated by their respective endpoints at z = Z\n(i.e., by r \u223c 1/Q), (b) the dominant behaviour at large Z is given by the Gaussian\nexp(\u2212z 2 /\u03c3 2 ), and (c) after also computing the prefactors in front of this Gaussian, the\ndominant contribution is found to come from the symmetric configurations.\nTo demonstrate this, we shall first consider the symmetric integral:\nT\nStot\n\n\u223c \u03c3\n\nZ\n\nZ/\u03c3\n\n3\n\n\u223c\n\n\u221e\n\ndx Erfc(x) \u223c \u03c3\n2\n\n\u03c3\nZ\nexp \u2212 2\n2\nZ\n\u03c3\n\n!\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nZ/\u03c3\n\ndx \u2212x2\ne\n\u223c \u03c3\nx\n\n,\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nZ 2 /\u03c32\n\ndt \u2212t\ne\nt\n(4.21)\n\nwhere x = z/\u03c3, t = x2 , and we have used the asymptotic behaviour of Erfc(x), cf.\nEq. (3.18) (recall that Z/\u03c3 \u226b 1). It is now clear that the integral over t is dominated by\nits lower end at t = Z 2 /\u03c3 2 , i.e., by z = Z, as anticipated.\nThe aligned\u2013jet contribution can be similarly treated: because of the exponential factor ez\nwithin the integrand, the integral in Eq. (4.20) is dominated by its upper cutoff at z = Z,\nwhich yields\nATtot\n\nZ2\n\u03c3\nexp \u2212 2 .\n\u223c\nZ\n\u03c3\n!\n\n(4.22)\n\nAs anticipated, this contribution is suppressed (by a factor Z/\u03c3 2 \u226a 1) with respect to\nthe contribution (4.21) of the symmetric configurations.\n47\n\n\fSimilar conclusions hold for the longitudinal sector : the dominant contribution is again\ngenerated by dipole sizes r \u223c 1/Q and it is of the same order as ATtot , Eq. (4.22), hence it is\nparametrically suppressed. We thus conclude that the inclusive cross\u2013section in the high\u2013\nenergy limit and for relatively large Q2 is dominated by symmetric dipole configurations\nwith typical sizes r \u223c 1/Q within the transverse sector.\nIt is in fact quite straightforward to go beyond the parametric estimate in Eq. (4.21) and\ncompute the dominant behaviour exactly. We present here only the final results, since a\nsimilar calculation will be explained in more detail below, for the case of diffraction.

Eq. (4.21)).\nThis behaviour is illustrated in Figs. 13 and 14, which are the analog at the level of the\nDIS inclusive cross\u2013section of Figs. 10 and 11 for the dipole amplitude. Namely, these\nfigures represent results obtained via the numerical evaluation of the total cross\u2013section\n(4.3) with the dipole amplitude in Eq. (3.17) with \u03b3 = 1. Fig. 13 shows the increase\nin the deviation from the mean\u2013field behaviour (and thus from geometric scaling) when\nincreasing \u03c3, whereas Fig. 14 demonstrates the emergence of the diffusive scaling and the\nconvergence of the cross\u2013section towards its high\u2013energy asymptotic in Eq. (4.27).\nii) Diffractive cross\u2013sections\nMoving to the diffractive sector, one can immediately notice an important difference with\nrespect to the mean\u2013field scenario of Sect. 4.2.1: Whereas in that case, the replacement of\nthe dipole amplitude by its square has strongly suppressed the small\u2013dipole configurations\nand thus shifted the strength of the integration from r \u223c 1/Q to r \u223c 1/Qs , in the present,\nhigh\u2013energy, case, there is no similar suppression, because both the Gaussian exp(\u2212z 2 /\u03c3 2 )\nand its square exp(\u22122z 2 /\u03c3 2 ) decay rather slowly (as compared to the exponential e\u2212z )\nwithin the interesting range at \u03c3 \u226a z \u226a \u03c3 2 . Accordingly, the aligned\u2013jet contribution to\nhigh\u2013energy q q\u0304 diffraction, namely (compare to Eq. (4.14))\nATdiff\n\n\u221e\n\u0012 \u0013\nZ Z\n1 Z dr\n2\n2 z\nz\n\u2212Z\n\u223c\ndz e Erfc\n.\nhT (r)iY \u223c e\nQ2\nr3\n\u03c3\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(4.30)\n\n2/Q\n\nis dominated by its lower end at r \u223c 1/Q (that is, by z = Z), so like the corresponding\ncontribution (4.20) to the inclusive cross\u2013section.\nThis points towards an important physical difference between the mean\u2013field (or intermediate energy) behaviour and the behaviour at high energy, which deserves a more\nqualitative explanation. To that aim, notice that the measure dr/r 3 in the aligned\u2013jet integral favors the small dipoles, so the integral would be naturally dominated by its lower\nend at r \u223c 1/Q if there was not for the strong suppression of the dipole sizes r \u226a 1/Qs\nintroduced by the dipole amplitude squared T 2 . Such a strong suppression occurs, as we\nhave seen, for the mean\u2013field amplitude T\u0304 , and also for the typical events in the statistical ensemble in QCD at high energy and large Q2 \u226b hQ2s i : indeed, a typical event has\nQs \u223c hQs i and thus yields a small contribution, of order hQ2s i /Q2 = e\u2212Z , to the integral. However, due to the front dispersion in the presence of fluctuations, the statistical\nensemble contains also fronts which are at saturation at the minimal size 1/Q, and each\nsuch a front yields a relatively large contribution, of O(1). Although such fluctuations are\nrelatively rare, their contribution weighted by the respective probability \u223c exp(\u2212Z 2 /\u03c3 2 )\nis still larger than that of the typical fronts, which behaves like e\u2212Z . In other terms,\nthe convolution peaks up those rare gluon configurations, or 'black spots', in the target\nwavefunction which are at saturation at the scale Q2 set by the virtual photon.\nTherefore, at high energy - and in contrast to what happens in the mean\u2013field approximation, or at intermediate energies - the inclusive and diffractive cross\u2013sections receive\n50\n\n\ftheir dominant contributions from the same physical configurations, namely the small\ndipoles with size r \u223c 1/Q. In fact, a qualitative analysis similar to that in Eqs. (4.18)\u2013\n(4.22) reveals that the analogy between inclusive and diffractive processes at high energy\nis even stronger: In the large\u2013Q2 regime defined by Eq. (4.17), both types of cross\u2013sections\nare dominated by symmetric dipole configurations within the transverse sector. In parq q\u0304\nticular, the dominant behaviour of \u03c3diff\ncan be estimated as in Eq. (4.21), and reads\nq q\u0304\nd\u03c3diff\n\u03c34\n2Z 2\nT\n\u2243\nS\n\u223c\nexp\n\u2212\ndiff\nd2 b\nZ3\n\u03c32\n\n!\n\nfor\n\n\u03c3 \u226a Z \u226a \u03c32 ,\n\n(4.31)\n\nwhich implies the following estimate for the (diffractive/inclusive) ratio R :\n\u03c3\nZ2\nR \u223c\nexp \u2212 2\nZ\n\u03c3\n\n!\n\nfor\n\n\u03c3 \u226a Z \u226a \u03c32 .\n\n(4.32)\n\nThis is a scaling function, which decreases quite rapidly with Q2 at fixed Y (unlike the\nrespective mean field estimate in Eq. (4.15)), but one should notice that this decrease\nbecomes significant only at very large Q2 , such that Z \u226b \u03c3.\n\nq q\u0304\nTo make these estimates more precise, let us compute the dominant behaviour of \u03c3diff\nin the regime \u03c3\u03b30 \u226b 1 and Z \u226a \u03c3 2 . This is obtained by evaluating the convolution in\nEq. (4.6) with the dipole amplitude hT (r)i in Eq. (3.13). Consider first the longitudinal\ncross section. Using Eq. (A.2) and defining u = r Q and \u03c4 = Q/ hQs i we have\nL\n\u03c0F\nd\u03c3diff\n=\nd2 b\n2\n\nZ1\n\ndv\n\nZ\u221e\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\ndu 4v (1 \u2212 v)\n\n2\n\nu K20\n\n\u0012 q\n\n\u0013\n\nu v(1 \u2212 v) Erfc\n\n2\n\nln(\u03c4 2 /u2 )\n.\n\u03c3\n!\n\n(4.33)\n\nWhen \u03c3 is large we can set u = 1 in the argument of the error function; indeed, as\npreviously explained, the convolution is dominated by r \u223c 1/Q. Then the integrals over\nu and v are easily performed and we arrive at (note that ln \u03c4 2 = ln(Q2 /hQ2s i) = Z)\nL\nd\u03c3diff\n\u03c0F\n2 Z\n=\nErfc\nd2 b\n6\n\u03c3\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(4.34)\n\nNow let us look at the transverse cross section.

As anticipated by the notation in\nEq. (4.41), this is in fact the complete dominant contribution to the diffractive cross\u2013\nsection in the high\u2013energy regime of interest (see the discussion in Sect. 4.3). This quantity\nhas the same qualitative behaviour as the inclusive cross\u2013section in Eq.

This configuration is physically relevant\nfor relatively large diffractive mass MX2 \u226b Q2 , or small values of \u03b2 \u226a 1, but such that\n\u1fb1s ln(1/\u03b2) \u226a 1, in order for the effects of the higher Fock states in the projectile to be\nnegligible. As we shall see, the two\u2013component configuration generates contributions of\norder \u1fb1s ln(1/\u03b2) to both the elastic and the inelastic pieces of the diffractive cross\u2013section,\nbut at high energy, the inelastic piece is parametrically suppressed with respect to the\nelastic one in the whole kinematical range of interest (including the large\u2013Q2 domain\ndefined by Eq. (4.17), which extends with Y ). This means that, if one starts at Y = Ygap ,\nwhere the diffraction is purely elastic (cf. Eq. (2.10)), and one increases Y for a fixed value\nof Ygap (i.e., one increases the rapidity of the projectile), then the elastic piece of diffraction\nwill rise faster than the inelastic one, and thus will remain the dominant contribution to\n\u03c3diff at any Y \u2265 Ygap (i.e., for arbitrarily small 12 \u03b2). This situation occurs for sufficiently\nhigh values of Ygap , such that \u03c3(Ygap ) \u226b 1, and is in sharp contrast with the corresponding\nmean\u2013field scenario [43, 50], where for Q2 \u226b Q2s the inelastic diffraction rises faster than\nthe elastic one with 1/\u03b2 and thus rapidly dominates over the latter.\nOne should also remind here that the diffractive cross\u2013section that we have in mind, cf.\nEqs. (2.1) and (4.2), is integrated over all the values of the rapidity gap between Ygap and\nY . But, of course, the differential cross\u2013section d\u03c3diff /d ln(1/\u03b2) at sufficiently small \u03b2 \u226a 1\n12\n\nStrictly speaking, our argument applies so long as \u1fb1s ln(1/\u03b2) \u226a ln(1/\u03b12s ), i.e., for a projectile\nwhich is non\u2013saturated, since this is the validity limit of Eq.

In what follows, we shall compute the lowest\norder contribution to this differential cross\u2013section, as given by the q q\u0304g state.\n4.3.1 Diffractive DIS with one or two dipoles\nWithin the present approximations, the scattering probabilities for an onium made with\ntwo dipoles are obtained by taking N = 2 in the general formulae in Sect. 2 and using the\ndipole probabilities P1 and P2 given by Eq. (2.14) with dY = Y \u2212 Y0 = ln(1/\u03b2).\nWe are primarily interested in diffraction, but in order to separate its elastic and inelastic\ncomponents, we also need the forward amplitude A(x, y; Y ), so let us start with this latter.\nAccording to Eq. (2.9), the forward amplitude can be expressed either as the scattering\nof a single q q\u0304 dipole in the frame where the target has rapidity Y :\nA(x, y; Y ) = hT (x, y)iY ,\n\n(4.43)\n\nor as the scattering of an onium composed of two dipoles, in the frame where the target\nhas rapidity Y0 (with the simplified notation Txy \u2261 T (x, y)) :\nA(x, y; Y ) = hT (x, y)iY0 + ln(1/\u03b2) \u2206A(x, y; Y0) ,\nZ\n\u1fb1s\n\u2206A(x, y; Y0) \u2261\nM(x, y, z) hTxz + Tzy \u2212 Txz Tzy \u2212 Txy iY0 .\n2\u03c0 z\n\n(4.44)\n\nThe quantity \u2206A describes the changes in A brought in by the one\u2013step evolution, namely,\nthe scattering of the two\u2013dipole state (the first three terms within the brackets) together\nwith the 'virtual' correction to the scattering of the one\u2013dipole state (the fourth term\nthere). By comparing Eqs. (4.43) and (4.44) and taking the limit dY \u2261 ln(1/\u03b2) \u2192 0, one\ncan immediately deduce an evolution equation for hTxy iY :\n\u1fb1s Z\n\u2202 hTxz iY\n=\nM(x, y, z) hTxz + Tzy \u2212 Txy \u2212 Txz Tzy iY ,\n\u2202Y\n2\u03c0 z\n\n(4.45)\n\nwhich is recognized as the first equation in both the Balitsky hierarchy [5] and in the\nhierarchy of equations with Pomeron loops [14]. (The differences between these two hierarchies, which express the effects of gluon number fluctuations, start with the second\nequation, as obeyed by the two\u2013dipole amplitude hT (x1 , y1)T (x2 , y2 )iY .) Within the mean\nfield approximation (2.32), Eq. (4.45) reduces to the BK equation (2.39).\nConsider similarly the elastic probability, Eq. (2.7). This too can be evaluated in either\nframe (the 'Y \u2013frame' and the 'Y0 \u2013frame'), with the following results :\nPel (x, y; Y ) = |hT (x, y)iY |2 \u2243 |hT (x, y)iY0 |2 + ln(1/\u03b2) \u2206Pel (x, y; Y0)\n\u2206Pel (x, y; Y0) \u2261 2 Re{hT (x, y)iY0 \u2206A(x, y; Y0)} ,\n\n(4.46)\n\nwhere the expression in the Y0 \u2013frame holds to the order of interest in \u1fb1s ln(1/\u03b2). Clearly,\n\u2206Pel represents the q q\u0304g contribution to the elastic probability.\n55\n\n\fFor the diffractive probability (2.3), on the other hand, the choice of the Y0 \u2013frame is\nmandatory, since Y0 plays also the role of the physical rapidity gap. We thus find:\nq q\u0304\nPdiff (x, y; Y, Y0) = Pdiff\n(x, y; Y0) + ln(1/\u03b2) \u2206Pdiff (x, y; Y0),\n\n(4.47)\n\nwhere\nq q\u0304\nPdiff\n(x, y; Y0) \u2261 | hT (x, y)iY0 |2 = Pel (x, y; Y0)\n\n(4.48)\n\nis the contribution of the elementary q q\u0304 pair, and is the same as the elastic probability\ncorresponding to a total rapidity Y0 (cf. Eq. (4.46)), while\no\nn\n\u1fb1s\nM(x, y, z) |h1 \u2212 Sxz Szy iY0 |2 \u2212 |h1 \u2212 Sxy iY0 |2\n2\u03c0 z\nZ\no\nn\n\u1fb1s\n=\n(4.49)\nM(x, y, z) |hTxz + Tzy \u2212 Txz Tzy iY0 |2 \u2212 |hTxy iY0 |2\n2\u03c0 z\nZ\n\n\u2206Pdiff (x, y; Y0) \u2261\n\nrepresents the additional contribution due to the q q\u0304g state. This contains both elastic\ninel\nand inelastic components, and in order to separate the latter we use Pdiff\n= Pdiff \u2212 Pel ,\ntogether with Eqs. (4.46) and (4.48). This yields:\ninel\nPdiff\n(x, y; Y, Y0) = ln(1/\u03b2) \u2206Pinel (x, y; Y0)\n\u2206Pinel (x, y; Y0) \u2261 \u2206Pdiff (x, y; Y0) \u2212 \u2206Pel (x, y; Y0) .\n\n(4.50)\n\nFrom the expressions (4.44), (4.46) and (4.49), one immediately finds\n\u2206Pinel (x, y; Y0) =\n\n\u1fb1s\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\nz\n\nM(x, y, z) hTxz + Tzy \u2212 Txy \u2212 Txz Tzy iY0\n\n2\n\n.\n\n(4.51)\n\nNote that the inelastic diffraction starts at order \u1fb1s ln(1/\u03b2), i.e., it requires at least one\nsoft gluon in the wavefunction of the projectile.\nFrom Eqs. (4.7) and (4.50), one can deduce our lowest\u2013order approximation for the differential diffractive cross\u2013section, valid for \u03b2 \u226a 1 but such that \u1fb1s ln(1/\u03b2) \u226a 1 :\nZ 1\nZ\n\u03b3\nX\nd\u03c3diff\n2\n\u2243\ndz\nd\nr\n|\u03c8\u03b1\u03b3 (z, r; Q)|2 \u2206Pinel (b, r; Y0) .\n2\nd b d ln(1/\u03b2)\n0\n\u03b1=L,T\n\n(4.52)\n\nNote that, for the simple onium configuration at hand, the inelastic diffraction is, by\nconstruction, the probability to have two dipoles in the final state. Hence, the quantity\n(4.52) represents also the cross\u2013section for gluon production in diffractive DIS [45, 52], at\nthe present level of accuracy.\n4.3.2 The inelastic component of diffraction\nThe inelastic diffraction probability associated with the q q\u0304g state is given by Eq. (4.51),\nwhich after the trivial change of variable z \u2261 x \u2212 s is rewritten as (with r = x \u2212 y) :\n56\n\n\f\u2206Pinel (r) =\n\n\u1fb1s\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\ns\n\nr2\nhT (s) + T (r \u2212 s) \u2212 T (r) \u2212 T (s)T (r \u2212 s)i2 .\n2\n2\ns (r \u2212 s)\n\n(4.53)\n\nIn line with the previous approximations, we have assumed the high\u2013energy amplitudes to\nbe real and ignored their impact parameter dependence. It is also implicit in our notations\nthat the target expectation values are evaluated at a rapidity Y0 , and therefore they involve\nthe (average) saturation momentum hQ2s i (Y0 ) and the front dispersion \u03c3 2 (Y0 ) = Dfr \u1fb1s Y0 .\nWe shall evaluate this expression in both the mean\u2013field approximation and the general\ncase with fluctuations, to emphasize the difference between these two situations.\ni) The mean\u2013field approximation\nIn this approximation, the two\u2013dipole amplitude is assumed to factorize : hT (s)T (r \u2212 s)i \u2248\nT\u0304 (s) T\u0304 (r \u2212s), with T\u0304 (r) the mean\u2013field amplitude of Eq. (4.8). The most interesting situation is when the external dipole is small, r \u226a 1/Qs , and for that case one can distinguish\nbetween three different physical regions for the internal dipoles s and r \u2212 s : (i) one of\nthe two dipoles, say s, is much smaller than the external one: s \u226a r; (ii) both internal\ndipoles are much larger than the external one, but they are still small as compared to the\nsaturation length: r \u226a s \u2243 |r \u2212 s| \u226a 1/Qs ; (iii) both internal dipoles are at saturation: s \u2243 |r \u2212 s| >\n\u223c 1/Qs . Corresponding to these three cases, the integral in Eq. (4.53) is\ndecomposed into three pieces, which are estimated as (up to irrelevant numerical factors)\n\n\u2206Pinel (r) \u223c\n\n\uf8ee\nZr\n\uf8ef\n\u1fb1s \uf8f0\n0\n\nds 2 2 2\u03b3\n(s Qs ) + r 2\ns\n\n1/Q\nZ s\nr\n\nds 2 2 2\u03b3\n(s Qs ) + r 2\n3\ns\n\nZ\u221e\n\n1/Qs\n\n\uf8f9\n\nds \uf8fa\n2 2\n\uf8fb \u223c \u1fb1s r Qs (4.54)\n3\ns\n\nThe dominant contribution, as isolated in the r.h.s., comes from relatively large internal\ndipoles with sizes s \u223c 1/Qs \u226b r (i.e., from domains (ii) and (iii) alluded to above).\nNote the similarity between this calculation and that of the q q\u0304 contribution to the diffractive cross\u2013section in the MFA (cf. Eq. (4.14)) : the external dipole size r plays here the\nsame role as the resolution scale 1/Q in Eq. (4.14), and the dipole kernel has limiting\nbehaviours similar to those of the transverse virtual photon wavefunction (cf. Eq. (4.9)).\nThe case of a relatively large dipole r \u226b 1/Qs is technically more involved, but the\nanalysis in Ref. [50] shows that, in that case, \u2206Pinel (r) vanishes very fast - at least as\nfast as S\u0304 2 (r) \u2261 (1 \u2212 T\u0304 (r))2 - when increasing r.\nTo summarize, in the mean field approximation, \u2206Pinel (r) increases with r like r 2 at\nr 2 Q2s \u226a 1, it decreases very fast at r 2 Q2s \u226b 1, and it develops a maximum at r \u223c 1/Qs\n[50]. This behaviour is manifest on the \"mean field\" curve in Fig. 18.\nii) The high\u2013energy behaviour with fluctuations\nWe shall now extract the dominant behaviour of the integral in Eq. (4.53) in the high\u2013\nenergy regime at \u03c3 \u226b 1/\u03b30 and z \u2261 ln(1/r 2 hQ2s i) \u226a \u03c3 2 . We anticipate that, in this\nregime, the dominant contribution comes from internal dipoles with sizes comparable to\n57\n\n\fthat of the external one, s \u223c |r \u2212 s| \u223c r, hence one can use the high\u2013energy estimates\n(3.13)\u2013(3.14) for all the amplitudes which appear in Eq. (4.53).\nEq. (3.14) implies hT (s)T (r \u2212 s)i = hT (r< )i, where r< = min(s, |r \u2212 s|); thus, the\nquadratic and one of the linear terms in Eq. (4.53) cancel each other, and the integral\nreduces to\n\u2206Pinel = 2\n\n\u1fb1s\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\ns\n\nh\ni2\nr2\nhT\n(s)i\n\u2212\nhT\n(r)i\n,\ns2 (r \u2212 s)2\n\n(4.55)\n\nwhere the integration is now restricted to the half plane |s| \u2265 |r \u2212 s|. It is convenient to\nchange the integration variable to u = s/r. Then the above equation becomes\n\u2206Pinel\n\n\u03c60\n\u221e\nh\ni2\nd\u03c6\n\u1fb1s Z du Z\nhT\n(ur)i\n\u2212\nhT\n(r)i\n,\n=4\n2\u03c0\nu\n1 + u2 \u2212 2u cos \u03c6\n\n(4.56)\n\n0\n\n1/2\n\nwhere the upper limit is \u03c60 = arccos(1/2u). Since the scattering amplitudes in Eq. (4.56)\ndo not depend on the angle \u03c6, one can perform the angular integration to obtain\n\u2206Pinel\n\n\u1fb1s\n=8\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\u221e\n\n1/2\n\ndu\n\narctan\n\n\u0010\n\n(1+u)\n|1\u2212u|\n\nq\n\n2u\u22121\n2u+1\n\nu(1 + u)|1 \u2212 u|\n\n\u0011\n\nh\n\ni2\n\nhT (ur)i \u2212 hT (r)i .\n\n(4.57)\n\nOne can check that the above integrand vanishes as 1/u3 for large u. Thus, the dominant\ncontribution comes from u = O(1), that is, from internal dipoles sizes s such that s \u223c r,\nas anticipated. By using this property together with the specific form of the amplitude\ngiven in Eq. (3.13), we can expand\nln u2\n\u2202 hT i\nln u2\nln2 (r 2 hQ2s i)\n\u221a\n=\n,\nhT (ur)i \u2212 hT (r)i \u2243 \u2212\nexp\n\u2212\n\u03c3 \u2212\u2202(ln(r 2 hQ2s i)/\u03c3)\n\u03c0\u03c3\n\u03c32\n!\n\n(4.58)\n\nwhere we have kept only the first term in the Taylor expansion, since the other terms\nare suppressed by higher powers of ln(u2 )/\u03c3 and thus are truly negligible at high energy.\nAfter the expansion (4.58), the result of the integration is a pure number, so we arrive at\n\u1fb1s J\n2z 2\n\u2206Pinel (r) \u2243\nexp\n\u2212\n2\u03c0 \u03c0\u03c3 2\n\u03c32\n\n!\n\nfor\n\nz \u226a \u03c32 ,\n\n(4.59)\n\nwith J numerically computed as J = 15.1.\nThe above result is valid for both small and large dipoles and shows that \u2206Pinel (r) is\nan even function of z \u2261 ln(1/r 2 hQ2s i), which rapidly vanishes when |z| \u226b \u03c3 and has a\nmaximum at r 2 hQ2s i = 1. This behaviour is compared to the corresponding mean field\nbehaviour in Fig. 18 which shows that, when increasing the energy, the maximum around\nr 2 \u223c 1/hQ2s i becomes flatter and flatter. The emergence of the diffusive scaling with\nincreasing \u03c3 and the convergence towards the asymptotic form (4.59) are illustrated in\nFig. 19. (The various curves in Figs. 18 and 19 are obtained by numerically evaluating\nthe r.h.s. of Eq. (4.53) with the dipole amplitude in Eq.

Note\nthat after multiplication by \u03c3, this cross\u2013section exhibits diffusive scaling.\nIt might be interesting to compare this high\u2013energy estimate to the corresponding result\nat intermediate energies, as given by the mean field approximation (say, by the solution\nto the BK equation). In the high\u2013Q2 regime at Q2 \u226b Q2s , the latter can be estimated by\nusing \u2206Pinel \u223c \u1fb1s r 2 Q2s , cf. Eq.

By contrast, the high\u2013energy estimate (4.62) is dominated by r \u223c 1/Q.\n4.3.3 The elastic diffraction\nIn this subsection, we shall evaluate the increase \u2206Pel in the probability for elastic scattering due to the emission of one soft gluon (cf. Eq. (4.46)). Our purpose is to demonstrate\nthat, in the fluctuation\u2013dominated regime at high energy and relatively large Q2 , cf.\nEq. (4.17), this increase is parametrically larger than the corresponding evolution \u2206Pinel\nin the probability for inelastic diffraction, that we have already computed.\nLet us start by briefly discussing the case of the mean field approximation, where the\nopposite situation holds: for Q2 \u226b Q2s (or relatively small dipole sizes), the inelastic\npiece dominates over the elastic one. Indeed, by using \u2206Pel (r) \u2261 2 hT (r)i \u2206A(r) together\nwith \u2206A = \u2202 hT i/\u2202Y , cf. Eqs. (4.44)\u2013(4.45), and the expression (4.8) for the mean\u2013field\namplitude, one immediately finds: \u2206Pel \u223c \u1fb1s (r 2 Q2s )2\u03b3 for r \u226a 1/Qs . This is a 'higher\u2013\ntwist' effect, much smaller than the corresponding inelastic contribution in Eq. (4.54).\n60\n\n\fBut at high energy, \u2206Pel turns out to be the dominant contribution, down to very small\ndipole sizes, namely, so long as z \u226a \u03c3 2 . Moreover, its calculation turns out to be quite\nsubtle, as we explain now. On one hand, it is straightforward to use \u2206A = \u2202 hT (r)i/\u2202Y\ntogether with Eq. (3.26), to deduce :\nz\n\u2206Pel (r) \u2243 \u03bb\u1fb1s Erfc\n\u03c3\n\n\u0012 \u0013\n\n1\nz2\n\u221a\nexp \u2212 2\n\u03c0\u03c3\n\u03c3\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(4.64)\n\nwhich is indeed parametrically larger (for any z) than the corresponding inelastic piece,\nEq. (4.59). For instance, for small dipole sizes, or large z \u226b \u03c3, this elastic component\nbehaves like\n\u1fb1s \u03bb\n2z 2\n\u2206Pel (r) \u2243\nexp \u2212 2\n\u03c0 z\n\u03c3\n\n!\n\n\u03c3 \u226a z \u226a \u03c32 ,\n\nfor\n\n(4.65)\n\nand dominates over the inelastic piece by a large factor \u03bb\u03c3 2 /z \u226b 1, as anticipated.\nOn the other hand, the above estimate for \u2206Pel has the drawback to involve the average\nfront velocity \u03bb, which is generally unknown. It is therefore tempting to try and compute\n\u2206A(r) directly from its integral representation (4.44) together with Eqs. (3.13)\u2013(3.14)\nfor the dipole amplitudes. A priori, this calculation is independent of \u03bb and should even\nenable us to determine \u03bb, by comparison with the expected result in Eq. (3.26). But this\nexpectation appears to be naive: the coefficient of the would\u2013be dominant term at large Y\n- that term precisely which should be identified as \u03bb/\u03c3 - turns out to be zero. (This can\nbe checked via manipulations similar to those in Eqs. (4.56)\u2013(4.58): without taking the\nsquare of the amplitudes inside the integrand, so like in Eq. (4.57), the integral vanishes\nexactly after the expansion (4.58).) This seems to imply the unphysical result \u03bb = 0, but\nin reality it only means that the approximations (3.13)\u2013(3.14) - although the correct\nleading\u2013order estimates for the average amplitudes at high energy - cannot be used to\nalso evaluate the right hand sides of the evolution equations. The latter are sensitive to\nthe subleading terms, which are not under control in the present approximations.\nTo summarize, in the high\u2013energy regime of interest, the diffractive probability associated\nwith the q q\u0304g component is controlled by its elastic piece, \u2206Pdiff \u2248 \u2206Pel , and has the\ndominant behaviour displayed in Eq. (4.64). Although not as symmetric as the inelastic\ncontribution (4.59), the function (4.64) has still the properties to vanish for both very\nsmall and very large dipole sizes, and to develop a rather flat maximum at r \u223c 1/ hQs i.\nThis behaviour is illustrated in Fig. 20, which also shows that, when increasing \u03c3, the\nelastic piece rises faster than the inelastic one (compare to Fig. 18) and rapidly dominates\nover the latter at all dipole sizes, in agreement with our previous estimates.\nAfter replacing \u2206Pdiff \u2248 \u2206Pel in Eq. (4.47) and also using Eq. (4.48), it becomes clear\nthat the diffractive probability coincides with the elastic probability, Eq. (4.46), which\ndemonstrates Eq. (4.4) to the order of interest in \u1fb1s ln(1/\u03b2). Although we have considered\nhere only the simplest evolution of the projectile (namely, the formation of the q q\u0304g state),\nwe expect the property (4.4) to hold also for smaller values of \u03b2 (when higher Fock\u2013space\ncomponents come into play), for the reasons explained after Eq. (4.4). Assuming this to\nbe the case, we conclude that, within the high\u2013energy regime at \u03c3\u03b30 \u226b 1 and Z \u226a \u03c3 2 , the\n61\n\n\f10\n1\n\n1\n\u2206Pel\n\u03bb\n\n0.1\n\nFluct. \u03c3 = 3\nFluct. \u03c3 = 5\nFluct. \u03c3 = 7\nFluct. \u03c3 = 9\nMean field (\u03c3 = 0)\n\n0.01\n0.001\n1e-04\n1e-05\n1e-06\n1e-07 1e-06 1e-05 1e-04 0.001 0.01\nr 2 Q2s\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\nFig. 20.

The high\u2013energy estimate (4.64) is shown for various\nvalues of \u03c3 and compared to the mean\u2013field prediction obtained with Eq. (4.8).\n\ndiffractive DIS cross\u2013section is dominated by the elastic scattering of the onium, and thus\nis independent of \u03b2 (for a given value of Y ), within the limits of the leading\u2013logarithmic\napproximation with respect to ln(1/\u03b2). To that accuracy, the corresponding cross\u2013section\nhas already been evaluated in Eq. (4.41).\nLet us conclude with a remark which applies to both the inclusive and the diffractive\ncross\u2013sections and refers to their behaviour when increasing Y in the high\u2013energy regime:\nAt the end of Sect. 3, we have mentioned the 'rigidity' of the dipole amplitudes at high\u2013\nenergy, namely, their property to increase only slowly when increasing Y at fixed, but\nlarge Q2 , in the weak scattering regime. Not surprisingly, the same 'rigidity' transmits to\nthe DIS cross\u2013section in the diffusive\u2013scaling window defined by Eq. (4.17). For instance,\nthe Y \u2013derivative of the diffractive cross\u2013section in Eq.

We have worked in a Lorentz frame in which the high\u2013energy limit is\nachieved by boosting the hadronic target, which then evolves to very high gluon density,\nwhereas the rapidity of the projectile (the virtual photon) remains finite and relatively\nsmall. Our main emphasis has been on a novel type of universal behaviour which emerges\nat sufficiently high energy as a consequence of saturation and gluon\u2013number fluctuations\nin the target wavefunction. The essential feature of this new regime is the fact that the\nDIS cross\u2013sections at fixed impact parameter are dominated by the physics of saturation\nup to very large values of Q2 , well above the (average) saturation momentum hQ2s i of the\ntarget (which itself increases exponentially with Y ). And the distinguished signature of\nthis behaviour is a new, diffusive, scaling law, which should be obeyed by all the DIS\ncross\u2013sections at sufficiently high energies, and which reflects the Gaussian nature of the\nprobability distribution for the logarithm of the saturation momentum in the target.\nTo establish this behaviour, we have relied on two main types of ingredients: (i) a set\nof factorization formulae which relate the DIS cross\u2013sections to dipole\u2013target scattering\namplitudes, and (ii) the high\u2013energy estimates for the latter, as determined by the\nPomeron loop equations via the correspondence with statistical physics.\nConcerning point (i), let us recall here that we have restricted ourselves to diffractive\nprocesses in which the hadron undergoes elastic scattering, and to leading\u2013logarithmic\napproximations for the high\u2013energy evolutions of both the target and the projectile. Besides, we have assumed the projectile to remain dilute, and thus to obey BFKL evolution.\nUnder these assumptions, we have shown that a physically transparent description of the\ndiffractive processes, \u00e0 la Good and Walker, emerges when viewing the collision in the\nframe in which the rapidity of the target is equal to the minimal rapidity gap. In this\nframe, the final state interactions automatically cancel out, and the projectile can be represented as a distribution of dipoles which elastically scatter off the target. The effect of\nthe collision is to destroy the coherence of the dipole superposition and thus transform\nthe incoming photon into a collection of partons in the final state.\nConcerning point (ii), we should emphasize that the asymptotic functional form of the\ndipole amplitudes at high energy follows from very general and elementary considerations\n- the average amplitudes are dominated by saturated gluon configurations, for which\nthe single\u2013event amplitudes have reached their unitarity limit T = 1 - , and as such\nit should be very robust: It is likely that this dominant behaviour will not be modified\nby higher order perturbative corrections, nor by corrections in 1/Nc (but this remains to\nbe investigated). On the other hand, the energy dependencies of the average saturation\nmomentum hQ2s i and of the front dispersion \u03c3 2 are sensitive to the details of the evolution,\nand are presently unknown for realistic values of \u03b1s . This is why, in this paper, we have\nsystematically measured Q2 in terms of hQ2s i, and Y in terms of \u03c3 2 .\nPerhaps the most interesting, qualitative, conclusion of our analysis is the fact that, at\nsufficiently high energies and as a result of fluctuations, the physics of gluon saturation\n\n63\n\n\fstarts to be determinant at momenta Q2 well above the saturation momentum hQ2s i, within\na logarithmic distance ln(Q2 /hQ2s i) \u223c \u03c3 2 which increases linearly with Y . From previous\nstudies of the mean field approximation, we already knew that saturation can manifest\nitself at momenta larger than Qs , via the phenomenon of geometric scaling. In the present\nanalysis, we have shown that this phenomenon is preserved by fluctuations so long as the\nfront dispersion is not too large (i.e., for \u03c3 2 \u226a 1). What is however striking about the\nhigh\u2013energy regime at \u03c3 2 > 1 is that the physics above hQ2s i is not only influenced, but\nactually dominated by rare configurations at saturation. This has tremendous physical\nconsequences, for both the dipole amplitudes and the DIS cross\u2013sections :\n\u2022 The strong correlation property hT 2 (r)i \u2243 hT (r)i, which is natural at saturation where\nhT i = 1, appears to be satisfied up to very large Q2 \u2261 1/r 2 , where hT i \u226a 1.\n\u2022 The amplitudes and the DIS cross\u2013sections are very rigid, in the sense that they rise\nunusually slowly when increasing Y at fixed Q2 within the weak scattering regime.\n\u2022 At relatively large virtualities Q2 \u226b hQ2s i, cf. Eq. (4.17), the convolutions with the\nphoton wavefunction yielding the DIS cross\u2013sections are dominated by small sizes r \u223c\n1/Q for the q q\u0304 pair, as they select those gluon configurations in the target wavefunction\nwhich are at saturation on the resolution scale set by the virtual photon.\n\u2022 Similarly, the convolutions with the dipole probabilities yielding the average over the\nBFKL (onium) wavefunction of the projectile are dominated by dipole sizes of the order\nof their parent dipole - the original q q\u0304 pair - and hence of order 1/Q.\n\u2022 In the high\u2013energy limit, the DIS diffractive cross\u2013section becomes purely elastic (at\nthe level of the q q\u0304 pair), the inelastic contribution being parametrically suppressed.\n\u2022 Within the high\u2013energy regime defined by Eq. (3.11), all the amplitudes or cross\u2013\nsections show diffusive scaling, that it, they depend upon Q2 and Y only via the variable\nz/\u03c3 with z \u2261 ln(Q2 /hQ2s i).\n\u2022 Within the diffusive scaling region alluded to above, the 'twist expansion' does not\napply anymore: At large Q2 \u226b hQ2s i, the cross\u2013sections decay as a Gaussian of z/\u03c3,\nand not as a power of 1/Q2 .\nThese properties are in sharp contrast with the corresponding predictions of the MFA (that\nwe have also worked out in this paper, at least qualitatively, for the sake of comparison),\nand demonstrate the breakdown of the latter at sufficiently high energy.\nNote that the above conclusions depend upon the functional form of the dipole amplitudes,\nbut not upon the precise values of coefficients \u03bb and Dfr . But, of course, the latter are\nnecessary in order to translate our results into physical units for Y and Q2 . The small\u2013x\nphenomenology at HERA suggests \u03bb \u2243 0.2 \u00f7 0.3 [40, 49], but we refrain ourselves from\nsuggesting a similar, experimental, measure of the diffusion coefficient Dfr , as we do not\nbelieve that the high\u2013energy regime that we discuss here has been approached at HERA.\n(For instance, the diffractive data at HERA indicate the dominance of inelastic diffraction\nat small \u03b2 [50], at variance with the high\u2013energy behaviour that we predict here.) The\nconceptually proper way to compute \u03bb and Dfr for realistic values of \u03b1s (and within\nthe present approximations: high energy, leading\u2013order perturbative QCD, and large Nc )\nwould be by solving the Pomeron loop equations of Ref. [14]. This would also allow one\nto explicitly test our present, asymptotic, predictions, and to study the preasymptotic\nbehaviour, like the dependence upon the initial conditions or upon the impact parameter.\n\n64\n\n\fSuch more detailed calculations should allow one to determine the physical region in\nwhich this high\u2013energy behaviour should start to manifest itself and, especially, whether\nthis region might be accessible at the LHC.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to A.

In this appendix, we give the q q\u0304 dissociation probabilities for the\nvirtual photon. This well-known process can be computed in perturbative QED (to lowest\norder in \u03b1em ) and reads\n|\u03c8T\u03b3 (v, r; Q)|2 =\n|\u03c8L\u03b3 (v, r; Q)|2 =\n\n\u0011\no\n\u03b1em Nc X 2 n\u0010 2\n2\n2 2\n2 2\nv\n+\n(1\n\u2212\nv)\nQ\u0304\nK\n(\nQ\u0304\nr)\n+\nm\nK\n(\nQ\u0304\nr)\n,\ne\nf\nf\nf\n1\nf\n0\nf\n2\u03c0 2 f\n\no\n\u03b1em Nc X 2 n 2 2\n2 2\ne\n4Q\nv\n(1\n\u2212\nv)\nK\n(\nQ\u0304\nr)\n,\nf\n0\n2\u03c0 2 f f\n\n(A.1)\n(A.2)\n\nwhere Q\u03042f \u2261 v(1 \u2212 v)Q2 + m2f , mf and ef is the mass and the electric charge of the quark\nwith flavor f , and K0 and K1 are the modified Bessel functions.\nIn order to get estimates of the DIS cross-sections, i.e. to estimate the convolution of this\nwavefunction with the q q\u0304 interaction amplitude, we shall ignore the quark masses (these\nare important only for relatively small Q2 \u223c m2f ) and use simple approximations for the\nBessel functions, as quite common in the literature (see, e.g., [40] for similar manipulations). Specifically, since K\u03bd (x) decreases exponentially at large x, one can restrict the\nintegrations in Eqs. (4.1)\u2013(4.2) to values v and r such that Q\u0304f r < 1. Besides, for x \u226a 1,\nK1 (x) \u223c 1/x and K0 (x) \u223c ln(1/x), so the Bessel functions can be approximated as\nK0 (x) \u223c \u0398(1 \u2212 x),\n\nK1 (x) \u223c\n\n1\n\u0398(1 \u2212 x),\nx\n\n(A.3)\n\nwhere we ignore the overall normalization as well as the logarithmic singularity of K0 as\nx \u2192 0 (the latter is innocuous within the relevant convolutions). Another simplification\narises when performing the integral over v : the constraint v(1 \u2212 v)Q2 < 1 together with\nthe fact that v(1 \u2212 v) \u2264 1/4 for 0 \u2264 v \u2264 1 makes it natural to distinguish between\n(a) symmetric configurations, for which Q2 r 2 < 4 (\"small dipoles\"), and\n65\n\n\f(b) aligned jet configurations, for which 4 < Q2 r 2 (\"large dipoles\").\nIn the first case, there is no restriction on the v integral, which is then dominated by\nsymmetric values v \u223c 1/2. In the second case, the dominant contributions correspond\nto the situation in which one of the two dipoles carries most of the total longitudinal\nmomentum, that is, v is either close to zero, or close to one, which allows us to further\nsimplify the respective integrand. As a result of such simplifications, the convolutions\ninvolving the photon wavefunctions can be finally estimated as shown in Eqs. (4.9)\u2013(4.10).\n\nB\n\nThe diffractive cross\u2013section near \u03b2 = 1\n\nIn this Appendix we present the result for the differential diffractive cross\u2013section per\nunit rapidity for \u03b2 \u2243 1 as obtained when relaxing the leading\u2013logarithmic approximation\nin ln(1/\u03b2). As compared to the formulae in the main text, this quantity represents the\nintegrand which would give the elastic piece in the r.h.s. of Eqs. (2.1) if that quantity was\ncomputed beyond the leading\u2013log approximation w.r.t. ln(1/\u03b2). Notice that, within the\nlimits of that approximation, the elastic scattering implies \u03b2 = 1, hence the corresponding\ndifferential distribution is just a \u03b4\u2013function \u223c \u03b4(\u03b2 \u2212 1). But this distribution gets smeared\nafter more accurately taking into account the kinematics for the diffractive production of\nthe q q\u0304 pair into which the virtual photon has fluctuated.\nIn the leading\u2013logarithmic approximation with respect to ln(1/x), one finds [36, 37]\nZ\nq q\u0304\nd\u03c3diff\nQ2 X\n\u2032\n=\nd2 rd2 r \u2032 dv v(1 \u2212 v) \u0398(\u03ba2f ) ei\u03baf *(r \u2212r)\n2\nd b d ln(1/\u03b2)\n4\u03c0\u03b2 f\nX\n\n\u03b1=L,T\n\n\u03a6f\u03b1 (v, r, r \u2032)hT (r, b)iYgap hT (r \u2032 , b)iYgap\n\n(B.1)\n\nwhere \u03ba2f = v(1 \u2212 v)MX2 \u2212 m2f .

When \u03bamax\nf\n\u2032\nthe difference r \u2212 r is small as compared to both r and r \u2032 , so one can approximate the\nR\n\u2032\nintegral d2 \u03baf ei\u03baf *(r \u2212r) by \u03b4 (2) (r \u2032 \u2212 r), which then yields (B.5).\nNote finally that the differential cross\u2013section is proportional to the diffractive structure\nfunction F2D,3 (x, Q2 , \u03b2), which is measured at HERA:\nF2D,3(x, Q2 , \u03b2)\n\n\u03b3\nQ2 \u03b2\nd\u03c3diff\n= 2\n.\n4\u03c0 \u03b1em x d ln(1/\u03b2)\n\n(B.6)\n\nReferences\n[1] E.
