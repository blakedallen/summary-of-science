The former quantifier\nwas introduced to test how good the family of fractional Brownian motion [2]\n(fBm) processes model the wandering of such laser beam, while the NTWS is\na more general quantifier aimed to study any given dynamic system [3]. Also,\nin a recent work we have analyzed the dynamic case: the laboratory-generated\nturbulence was set up to change in time [4]. We have observed that these\nquantifiers are correlated, but at the time only a qualitative argument was\ngiven. Furthermore, each one of these quantifiers have been used separately\nto obtain information from biospeckle phenomenon [5, 6].\nThe fBm is the only one family of processes which are self-similar, with stationary increments, and gaussian [7]. The normalized family of these gaussian\nprocesses, B H , is the one with B H (0) = 0 almost surely, E[B H (t)] = 0, and\ncovariance\nh\n\ni\n\nE B H (t)B H (s) =\n\n\u0011\n1 \u0010 2H\n|t| + |s|2H \u2212 |t \u2212 s|2H ,\n2\n\n(1)\n\nfor s, t \u2208 R. Here E[ *] refers to the average with gaussian probability density.\nThe power exponent H has a bounded range between 0 and 1. These processes\nexhibit memory, as can be observed from Eq. (1), for any Hurst paremeter but\nH = 1/2. In this case successive Brownian motion increments are as likely to\nhave the same sign as the opposite, and thus there is no correlation. Otherwise, it is the Brownian motion that splits the family of fBm processes in\ntwo. When H > 1/2 the correlations of successive increments decay hyperbolically, and this sub-family of processes have long-memory. Besides, consecutive\nincrements tend to have the same sign, these processes are persistent. For\nH < 1/2, the correlations of the increments also decay but exponentially, and\nthis sub-family presents short-memory. But since consecutive increments are\nmore likely to have opposite signs, it is said that these are anti-persitent.\nThe Wavelet Analysis is one of the most useful tools when dealing with data\nsamples. Thus, any signal can be descomposed by using a diadic discrete family\n{2j/2 \u03c8(2j t\u2212k)}-an orthonormal basis for L2 (R)-of translations and scaling\nfunctions based on a function \u03c8: the mother wavelet. This wavelet expansion\nhas associated wavelet coefficients given by Cj (k) = hS, 2j/2 \u03c8(2j * \u2212k)i. Each\nresolution level j has an associated energy given by Ej = E |Cj (k)|2 . If the\nsignal has stationary increments the coefficients are independent on k and\nthen the relative wavelet energy, RWE, is\npj =\n\nEj\n,\nEtot\n\n(2)\n\nwith j \u2208 {\u2212N, . . . , \u22121}, where N = log2 M is the number of sample points,\nP\n2\nand Etot = \u22121\nj=\u2212N E |Cj | is the total energy. Thus the NTWS is defined as\n2\n\n\f(see [1] and references therein)\n\u22121\nX\n\nSWT = \u2212\n\npj * log2 pj /S max ,\n\nwith S max = log2 N.\n\n(3)\n\nj=\u2212N\n\nFor a signal originated from a fBm the energy per resolution level can be\ncalculated using the formalism introduced in Ref. [8], see Appendix 3,\n2\n\nE |Cj (k)| = 2\u0393(2H + 1) sin(\u03c0H)2\nfor any mother wavelet election satisfying\nwavelet energy for a finite data sample is\npj = 2\n\n(j\u22121)(1+2H)\n\nR\n\n\u2212j(2H+1)\n\nR\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n|\u03c8\u0302|2 (\u03bd)\n,\n\u03bd 2H+1\n\n(4)\n\n\u03c8 = 0.

(6)\nlog2 N\n1 \u2212 2\u2212N (1+2H)\nAs it was expected the entropy decreases when H increases, with H measuring\nthe level of order of the signal.\n\n2\n\nSimulations and tests\n\nTo test the functional relation between the Hurst exponent and NTWS we\nhave simulated 50 fractional Brownian motion data samples [9] for each H \u2208\n{0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9}. Since we have examined data of 5000\npoint in length in Ref. [1], these samples are set to the same length. For\neach set we estimate H and SWT . Moreover, we employ an orthogonal cubic\nspline function as mother wavelet. Among several alternatives, the cubic spline\nfunction is symmetric and combine in a suitable proportion smoothness with\nnumerical advantages. It has become a recommendable tool for representing\nnatural signals [10, 11].\nThe Hurst parameter is estimated as usual: by plotting the logarithm of the\n3\n\n\festimated energy per resolution level j,\nEb\n\nj\n\nN\n1 Xj\n=\n|Cj (k)|2 ,\nNj k=1\n\n(7)\n\nwith Nj = 2\u2212j M the number of coefficients at resolution level j, versus j and\nfitting a minimum square line. The slope of the line is the desired estimator.\nFor NTWS we start dividing the signal into NT non-overlapping temporal windows with length L, NT = M/L. The wavelet energy estimator at resolution\nlevel j for the time window i is given by\n(i)\n\nEbj =\n\n1\nNj\n\ni*L\nX\n\nCj2 (k),\n\nwith i = 1, * * * , NT ,\n\n(8)\n\nk=(i\u22121)*L+1\n\nwhere Nj represents the number of wavelet coefficients at resolution level j\ncorresponding to the time window i; while the total energy estimator in this\nP\n(i)\n(i)\ntime window will be Ebtot = j<0 Ebj .\nHence, the time evolution estimators of RWE and NTWS will be given by:\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\npbj = Ebj /Ebtot ,\n\nSbWT (i) = \u2212\n\nX\n\nj<0\n\n(i)\n\n(9)\n(i)\n\npbj * log2 pbj /S max .\n\n(10)\n\nIn order to obtain a quantifier for the whole time period under analysis [3] the\ntemporal average is evaluated. The temporal average of NTWS is given by\nhSWT i =\n\nNT\n1 X\n(i)\nSb ,\nNT i=1 WT\n\n(11)\n\nand for the wavelet energy at resolution level j\nhEj i =\n\nNT\n1 X\n(i)\nEb ;\nNT i=1 j\n\n(12)\nP\n\nthen the total wavelet energy temporal average is defined as hEtot i = j<0 hEj i.\nIn consequence, a mean probability distribution {qj } representative for the\nwhole time interval (the complete signal) can be defined as\nqj = hEj i/hEtot i,\nwith\n\nP\n\nj\n\n(13)\n\nqj = 1 and the corresponding mean NTWS as\nSeW T = \u2212\n\nX\n\nqj * log2 qj /S max .\n\nj<0\n\n4\n\n(14)\n\n\fIn Figure 1 we compare H against its estimator. It has a good performance for\n0.3 < H < 0.9 and fails outside. Furthermore, the estimators fits better the\nlarger values. Figure 2 represents the temporal average of NTWS, hSWT i, and\nthe mean NTWS, SeW T , estimated with our procedure and compared against\nthe theoretical result in eq. (6) with N = 12. As usual, boxplots [12] show\nlower and upper lines at the lower quartile (25th percentile of the sample) and\nupper quartile (75th percentile of the sample) and the line in the middle of\nthe box is the sample median. The whiskers are lines extending from each end\nof the box indicating the extent of the rest of the sample. Outliers are marked\nby plus signs. These points may be considered the result of a data entry error\nor a poor measurement.\n\n3\n\nConclusions\n\nFor a fBm we have found, eq. (6), there is an inverse dependence: as H grows\nthe temporal average, hSWT i, and mean NTWS, SeW T , diminishes. It is verified\nwith the synthetic fBm data samples. This relation is logical, the spectrum has\nless high-frequency components as H gets higher and all the energy is closer\nto the origin, and, if H gets lower the energy contribution at high frequencies\nbecomes relevant. Observe that the closer \u0124 is to the exact value, the better\nare the results for both estimators of the entropy.\nFrom an analytical point of view both H and SWT are equivalent. Although,\nthe NTWS also contains information about the extension of the data set.\nNevertheless, from a computational point of view the latter is independent\non the scaling region, making the entropy less subjective. On the other hand\nthe logarithm in the entropy definition introduces important errors, as we see\nin Figure 2. To narrow these it is necessary to increase the data samples. It\nshould be stressed that extending the length of the data samples reduces the\nstatistical error.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work was partially supported by Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones\nCient\u0131\u0301ficas y T\u00e9cnicas (CONICET, Argentina) and Pontificia Universidad\nCat\u00f3lica de Valpara\u00edso (Project No. 123.774/2004, PUCV, Chile).\n5\n\n\fAPPENDIX A\nLet us take as the signal S(t) = B H (t, \u03c9), \u03c9 is fixed and represents one\nelement of the statistic ensemble and it will be omitted hereafter.

(18) corresponds to a Gaussian process, then for\nintegers j, k, j \u2032 , k \u2032 the correlation is equal to [14]\nh\n\n\u2217\n\ni\n\nE CjH (k)CjH\u2032 (k \u2032 ) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u2032\n\nH\n\u2032\n2(1/2+H)(j+j ) dH\nn (k)dn (k ).\n\nn=1\n\nNow, from eq. (19) and orthogonality of the Hermite functions the above\n6\n\n\fequation is rewritten in the following way\nh\n\nE\n\n\u2217\nCjH (k)CjH\u2032 (k \u2032 )\n\ni\n\n=\n\n\u2032\nc2H 2(1/2+H)(j+j )\n\nZ\n\n|\u03bd|\u2212(1+2H) |\u03a8(\u03bd)|2 e\u2212i(k\u2212k )\u03bd d\u03bd, (20)\n\u2032\n\nR\n\nwhich is the usual expresion found in many works, see [15] and references\ntherein. The integral has convergence problems near the origin. These are\nresolved chosing a mother wavelet \u03c6 with K null moments. That is,\nZ\n\ntk \u03c6(t) dt = 0,\n\nR\n\nfor k = 0, * * * , K \u2212 1. Therefore, |\u03a8(\u03bd)|2 = a1 |\u03bd|2K + a2 |\u03bd|2K+1 + o(|\u03bd|2K+1 ).\nWhen k and k \u2032 are far apart, i. e., m = k \u2212 k \u2032 \u2192 \u221e, the integral in eq. (20) is\ndominated by the contribution of frequencies in the interval [0, 1], thus giving\nh\n\ni\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2032\n\nE CjH (k)CjH\u2032 (k \u2032 ) \u2248 2a1 c2H 2(1/2+H)(j+j )\n\u2032\n\nZ\n\n1\n0\n\n\u03bd 2K\u22122H\u22121 cos(m\u03bd) d\u03bd\n\n= 2a1 c2H 2(1/2+H)(j+j ) \u0393(2K \u2212 2H) cos(\u03c0(K \u2212 H))m2K\u22122H\n+ O(m2K\u22122H\u22121 ), (21)\n\nfor K > H. The coefficients of a wavelet expansion are highly correlated. But,\nfor j = j \u2032 and k = k \u2032 ,\n\nE\n\n2\nCjH (k)\n\n=\n\nc2H 2(1+2H)j\n\nZ\n\n|\u03bd|\u2212(1+2H) |\u03a8(\u03bd)|2 d\u03bd\n\nR\n\n= 2\u0393(2H + 1) sin(\u03c0H)2(1+2H)j\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n\u03bd \u2212(1+2H) |\u03a8(\u03bd)|2 d\u03bd,\n\n(22)\n\nwe recover the mean energy by resolution level j. Therefore, the RWE is\nobtained replacing the above into eq. (2):\n#\n\n\"\n\n2j(1+2H)\n1 \u2212 2\u2212(1+2H)\npj = P\u22121\n2(j+1)(1+2H) .\n=\n\u2212N (1+2H)\nj(1+2H)\n1\n\u2212\n2\n2\nj=\u2212N\n\n(23)\n\nwhere the last equation comes from the evaluation of the geometric series\ncorresponding to the total energy. Its logarithm (base 2) is simply log2 pj =\n(1 + 2H)(j + 1) + log2 [1 \u2212 2\u2212(1+2H) /1 \u2212 2\u2212N (1+2H) ]. Finally, using these results\nin the definition of NTWS, it is\n\"\n\n#\n\n\u22121\nX\n1 \u2212 2\u2212(1+2H)\n(1\n+\n2H)\n(j + 1)2(j+1)(1+2H)\nSWT (N, H) =\n1 \u2212 2\u2212N (1+2H)\nj=\u2212N\n\n\"\n\n#\n\n\"\n\n1 \u2212 2\u2212(1+2H)\n1 \u2212 2\u2212(1+2H)\n+\nlog\n2\n1 \u2212 2\u2212N (1+2H)\n1 \u2212 2\u2212N (1+2H)\n\n#\n\n\u22121\nX\n\n2(j+1)(1+2H) , (24)\n\nj=\u2212N\n\nthen handling the geometric sums carefully we obtain eq.
