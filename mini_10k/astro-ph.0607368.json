A phenomenological study on the concomitant neutrinos that would be radiated if the \u03b3-ray emission is hadronic in origin is\nherein presented. Neutrino oscillations are considered, and the expected number\nof events in a km-scale detector such as ICECUBE is computed under different\nassumptions including orbital periodicity and modulation, as well as different precision in the modeling of the detector. We argue that the upper limits already\nimposed on the neutrino emission of LS I +61 303 using AMANDA-II and the\nforthcoming measurements by ICECUBE may significantly constrain -in an independent and unbiased way- the \u03b3-ray to neutrino flux ratio, and thus the possibility\nof a hadronic origin of the \u03b3-rays. The viability of hadronic models based on\nwind-jet interactions in the LS + 61 303 system after MAGIC measurements is\ndiscussed.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe possibility of an hadronic origin of high energy radiation from microquasars\nand gamma-ray binaries have been recently extensively discussed (e.g., see Romero\net al. 2001, 2003, Bosch-Ramon et al. 2005 and references therein). Earlier works\nhave already dealt with neutrino and high energy emission from galactic sources,\nand especially those presenting jets. Among them, Levinson and Blanford (1996)\nwhere among the first to suggest a possible correlation between microquasars and\ngamma-ray sources. Later, Levinson and Waxman (2001) showed that if the energy content of the jets was dominated by an electron-proton plasma, a several hour\noutburst of 1\u2013100 TeV neutrinos produced by photomeson interactions should precede the radio flares that are associated with major ejections. Photopion production\nin jets was also considered by Distefano et al. (2002), by assuming the parameters of their model as inferred from radio observations. A recent review on the\nhigh energy aspects of astrophysical jets, together with more complete references\n\n1\n\n\fto previous works, can be found in the work by Levinson (2006). Partially, recent\nwork has been motivated by the discovery of the presence of relativistic hadrons in\nmicroquasar jets like those of SS 433, as inferred from iron X-ray line observations\n(e.g. Migliari et al. 2002). In addition, some sources (as LS 5039 and LS I +61\n303) present quite inconspicuous behavior at X-rays, with low variability and flux\nlevels. Protons, generally being subject to less efficient energy loss mechanisms\nthan electrons, could be accelerated to high energies generating only low luminosity counterparts at other frequencies. Microquasars have then been proposed to be\nan additional source of cosmic rays (e.g., Heinz & Sunayev 2002). It is however\ntrue that the proof of protons being behind the highest energy photons detected\nso far has yet to be given at a level that not even reasonable doubt is tenable. At\nthe moment, neither the analysis of EGRET detections correlated with supernova\nremnants (see Torres et al. 2003 for a review) nor the recent HESS results (e.g.,\nAharonian et al. 2006) are conclusive in this respect. This is a central problem\nof cosmic-ray physics. However, key multiwavelength observations (for instance,\nfor RX J0852.0-4622, see Aharonian et al. 2006b) are not far from elucidating the\norigin of the gamma radiation, at least for some cases. It is clear that the detection\nof concomitant neutrino emission from a hadronic source of gamma-rays would be\na definite proof.\nHere, under the model independent assumption that the \u03b3-ray spectrum measured by the Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov telescope (MAGIC,\nAlbert et al. 2006) results from inelastic pp collisions, a lower limit to the neutrino yield expected from LS I +61 303 is computed. Disregarding the nature\nof the compact object in LS I +61 303, recently classified as a gamma-ray pulsar\nwind system by Dhawan et al. (2006), a hadronic interpretation of the gamma\nemission would result in a prediction of a neutrino yield. In any case, if there are\njets, their matter content is unknown. We note, however, that modeling the high\nenergy radiation with pp collisions is not discarding leptonic contributions (see\ne.g., Bosch-Ramon et al. 2006), since those might dominate at lower gamma-ray\nenergies and at other locations in the orbit of the binary system, where electron\nlosses are diminished. The appeal of hadronic emission of TeV radiation in close\nX-ray binary systems can be understood if one considers the losses and acceleration process for electrons, under the assumptions of a given magnetic field. We\ndiscuss these issues in more detail below. In this paper, we discuss how this pp\nassumption can be tested using neutrino telescopes under different scenarios for\nvariability, and whether earlier proposed hadronic microquasar models can still\ncomply with current observational constraints. The key approach we propose here\nis that an experiment such as ICECUBE could test the level of enhancement of\nneutrino emission as compared with that detected at TeV \u03b3-ray energies. By comparing with theoretical modeling of photon absorption, ICECUBE can ultimately\ntest or disprove a hadronic scenario for LS I +61 303.\n\n2\n\nLS I +61 303: basic facts\n\nLS I +61 303 shares with LS 5039 the quality of being the only two known microquasars that are spatially coincident with sources above 100 MeV listed in the\nThird Energetic Gamma-Ray Experiment (EGRET) catalog (Hartman et al. 1999),\nand the only two detected so far at higher \u03b3-ray energies (Aharonian et al. 2005,\nAlbert et al. 2006). These sources both show low X-ray emission and variability.\n\n2\n\n\fOptical spectroscopic observations of LS I +61 303, which is located at a distance\nof 2.0\u00b10.2 kpc (Frail & Hjellming 1991), revealed a rapidly rotating B0 main sequence star with a stable shell and radial velocities compatible with binary motion\nin a 26.5 day orbital period (Hutchings & Crampton 1981). The most accurate\nvalue of the orbital period, Porb =26.4960\u00b10.0028 d, comes from the analysis of\nmore than 20 years of periodic radio outbursts (Gregory et al. 2002). The maximum of the radio outbursts varies between phase 0.45 and 0.95 (assuming T 0 =JD\n2.443.366,775) following a modulation of 4.6 years. An X-ray outburst starting\naround phase 0.4 and lasting up to phase 0.6 has also been detected (Goldoni &\nMereghetti 1995, Taylor et al. 1996, Harrison et al. 2000). The periastron takes\nplace at phase 0.23 and the eccentricity is 0.72\u00b10.15. Extended jet-like and apparently precessing radio emitting structures at angular extensions of 0.01-0.05\narcsec have been reported by Massi et al. (2001, 2004); this discovery has supported the microquasar interpretation of LS I +61 303. The uncertainty as to what\nkind of compact object, a black hole or a neutron star, is part of the system (e.g.,\nCasares et al. 2005), seems to have been lifted while this paper was under review\nby Dhawan et al. (2006). These authors have presented preliminary results from a\nJuly 2006 VLBI campaign in which rapid changes are seen in the orientation of a\ncometary tail at periastron. This tail is consistent with it being the result of a pulsar\nwind (in which case, the gamma-emission should be the result of the interaction of\nthis wind with the companion star outflow). No large features or higher velocities\nwere noted on any of the observing days, i.e., there was no notice of the high 0.6c\nvelocity outflow as reported by Massi et al. 2005, which implies at the least its\nnon-permanent nature. The changes within 3 hours were found to be insignificant,\nso the velocity can not be much over 0.05 c. In fact, tail velocities around 7500\nkm s\u22121 were measured at periastron. If confirmed, these results would classify LS\nI +61 303 as a pulsar wind system (a gamma-ray binary) instead of a microquasar\n(powered by mass accretion). Debate is alive.\n\n3\n\nMAGIC detection of LS I +61 303\n\nThe spectrum derived from MAGIC data between 200 GeV and 4 TeV at orbital\nphases between 0.4 and 0.7 is fitted by a power law function:\nF\u03b3 = (2.7 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b1 0.8) \u00d7 10\u221212 (E/TeV)\u22122.6\u00b10.2\u00b10.2 cm\u22122 s\u22121 TeV\u22121 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwith the errors quoted being statistical and systematic, respectively (Albert et al.\n2006). MAGIC measurements showed that the very high energy \u03b3-ray emission\nfrom LS I +61 303 is variable. The maximum flux corresponded to about 16% of\nthat of the Crab Nebula, and was detected around phase 0.6 with 8.7\u03c3 of significance. In addition, since the system was observed in different orbital periods and\nthe detections occurred at similar orbital phases, there is a hint (although not yet\na published proof) of a periodic nature of the VHE \u03b3-ray emission. A definitive\nproof or disproof of periodicity of the \u03b3-ray emission in LS I +61 303 awaits the\npublication of further MAGIC observations.\n\n3\n\n\f4\n\nTimescales and models\n\nWhen analyzing the possibility of a leptonic origin of the gamma-ray emission (in\nsuch a case the neutrino production would be quenched), the location of the emitter within the source and the dichotomy between a fast jet or a slower cometary\ntail wind are crucial. To understand why, one can compare the relevant timescales\nand impose constraints upon the magnetic field. The maximum energy of accelerated electrons is generally computed by requesting that the acceleration timescale\nequals that of the losses (a.k.a. cooling), where the latter is provided by the\nelectron's radiation via synchrotron and Compton mechanisms. The acceleration\ntimescale is (e.g., Malkov & Dury 2001, Aharonian et al. 2005)\ntacc = \u03b7\n\nrL\n\u2248 0.11 ETeV B\u22121\nG \u03b7 s,\nc\n\n(2)\n\nwhere rL = E/eB is the Larmor radius, ETeV = E/1 TeV, and BG = B/1 G is\nthe strength of the ambient magnetic field. \u03b7 gives account of the efficiency of\nacceleration: in the case of extreme accelerators (maximum possible acceleration\nrate allowed by classical electrodynamics) \u03b7 \u2192 1, whereas for shock acceleration\nin the Bohm diffusion regime \u03b7 \u2248 10(v/c)\u22122 (see e.g. Malkov & Dury 2001). For\nthe Compton scattering we consider both, the Thompson and the Klein-Nishina\nregimes. In the former (say, for Ee \u226a 0.1 TeV) the cooling time is inversely\nproportional to the electron energy,\n\u22121\ntThom \u2248 0.03ETeV\ns.\n\n(3)\n\nIn the latter, the characteristic Compton cooling timescale can be approximated by\n0.7\ntKN \u2248 34w\u22121\n0 ETeV s,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere w0 = wr /500 erg cm\u22123 . The Compton scattering of TeV electrons against\nstarlight occurs in the Klein-Nishina regime. By equating the acceleration and\nCompton timescales, tacc = tKN , we obtain\n3.3\n3.3\nEe,max \u2243 82657.9[BG (v/c)2 w\u22121\nTeV \u2243 2[BG (v/0.2c)2 w\u22121\n0 ]\n0 ] ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the first equality is obtained just replacing the previous formulae and doing the algebra, and the second equality provides a useful scaling especially for\nmicroquasar jets, where velocities of 0.2c are tenable (e.g., as in LS 5039). The\ncompanion star of the compact object in LS I +61 303 is a BO V with a temperature about 22500 K. Its optical luminosity is taken to be L\u22c6 \u2248 2 \u00d7 1038 erg/s, and\nperiastron and apastron are reached at about 2.5 and 14.5 stellar radii (e.g., Romero\net al. 2005 and references therein). Assuming that R\u22c6 \u2243 10R\u2299 , as appropriate for\na Bo V/Be star, periastron (apastron) occurs at 1.7 \u00d7 1012 cm (1.0 \u00d7 1013 cm). The\nenergy density of the starlight\nwr =\n\nL\u22c6\n,\n4\u03c0R2 c\n\n(6)\n\nvaries then between 200 and 5 erg cm\u22123 . Formally, then, even for slow winds, a\nmagnetic field B > 1 G allows for the maximum energy of accelerated electrons to\napproach/exceed 10 TeV. For such fields however, synchrotron emission also plays\na role. The synchrotron timescale is\n\u22121\ntsync \u2248 400BG\u22122 ETeV\ns,\n\n4\n\n(7)\n\n\fthat is, for instance, at BG \u223c 10, the cooling is dominated by synchrotron radiation\nrather than Compton processes. Together with the equality tacc = tsync , gives\nEe,max \u2248 19BG\u22121/2 (v/c) TeV .\n\n(8)\n\nThese equations imply that electrons could be accelerated to energies exceeding 10\nTeV in a low-magnetic field environment and/or low stellar density w0 . In the case\nof a jet system, low magnetic fields can be attained far from the inner parts of the\njets, out of the core of the binary system. A periodic feature in the gamma-radiation\n(which is evidence of \u03b3-ray production inside the binary system) would then likely\nfavor hadrons, which cool less efficiently, as the primary particles. Their maximum\nenergy would be determined by the condition rL \u2264 Rjet , which gives\nE p \u2264 3 \u00d7 1015 (Rjet /108 cm)(B/105 G) eV,\n\n(9)\n\ni.e. and inner-jet magnetic field of about 105 G can produce PeV primaries. These\nprotons are not sufficiently energetic to interact with starlight to trigger photomeson processes, and since the X-ray emission from LS I +61 303 is not indicative of\nthe existence of an important accretion disk, the photomeson process against the\nX-ray photons is expected to be sub-dominant as well (the X-ray luminosity is only\nabout 1033 erg s\u22121 ). It is also possible to see that pion production would inevitably\nlead to neutrino emission (otherwise stated, that pions decay before interacting in\nthe media), and also that the production of neutrinos from the subsequent muon\ndecay also proceed with high probability as long as the magnetic field does not\nexceed B \u223c 106 G (see the computations from Aharonian et al. 2005 for the case\nof LS 5039: since LS I +61 303 have similar X-ray fluxes, they can be adapted vis\na vis to this scenario).\nFollowing the recent results form Dhawan et al. (2006), LS I +61 303 would\nbe similar to the system PSR 1259-63/SS2883. In the latter, a 48 ms radio pulsar\nis found in an eccentric orbit around a 10th magnitude main sequence star with an\nstrong wind, a Be star with T eff \u223c 27000 K. LS I +61 303 would have, however,\na much shorter period. The PSR 1259-63 system has been observed by CANGAROO (Kawachi et al. 2004) and HESS (Aharonian et al. 2005) and modeled by\nboth, a mainly leptonic (e.g., Kirk et al. 1999) and a mainly hadronic contribution\n(Kawachi et al. 2004). Interestingly,the observed lightcurve of the PSR 1259-63\nsystem seems to be qualitatively similar to the prediction made by the model of\nKawachi et al. (2004) where hadronic interactions and neutral pion production in\nthe mis-aligned stellar disk plays a dominant role in the gamma-ray production\nmechanism. Neronov et al. (2006) have also presented a hadronic interpretation of\nthe PSR 1259-63 HESS data, where the TeV emission is the result of pp collisions\nbetween protons accelerated in the pulsar wind and nuclei resident in the wind of\nthe stellar companion. Albeit a full hadronic model of LS I +61 303, in the case\nit actually is a pulsar wind system, is still missing and is beyond the scope of the\npresent work, one certain sub-product of a hadronic gamma-ray production would\nbe the concomitant emission of neutrinos. In what follows, we analyze in a model\nindependent way \u2013starting from the MAGIC data\u2013 up to what level a detector like\nICECUBE could detect such neutrinos.1\n1 NEMO/KM3NET, having a planned effective area similar in size to ICECUBE \u2013see, e.g., Distefano\net al. 2006 for a general discussion\u2013 would also be a key player in the possible detection of this system.\nHowever, due to location in the southern hemisphere, ICECUBE is better suited for an observational study\non LS I +61 303 and we focus the discussion on it. These alternative instruments would of course be key for\nthe detection of southern hemisphere sources, such as LS 5039.\n\n5\n\n\f5\n\nNeutrino yields\n\n5.1 Neutrino fluxes\nInelastic pp collisions lead to charged (2/3) and neutral (1/3) pions. Thus, if\nhadronic interaction are involved in the production of the \u03b3-ray flux, a comparable emission of \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bde is to be expected. For a detailed discussion of the\ncomputations of pp collision \u03b3-rays see, for example, the appendices in the works\nby Torres (2004) and Domingo-Santamar\u0131\u0301a & Torres (2005). The neutrino flux at\nthe production site can be obtained from the \u03b3-ray flux measured at Earth, although\nwith the caveat that the latter can be affected by absorption. Thus, the so-predicted\nneutrino flux is to be considered as a lower limit to the one actually produced. In\nthe GeV and TeV regime, if \u03b3-rays are significantly absorbed, the \u03b3-ray spectrum\nmay be steeper than the neutrino one, what further secures the lower limit quality of the estimation of the neutrino flux when starting from that in \u03b3-rays. The\n0\n\u03bd-flux is F\u03bdi = ki F\u03b3 where ki = (Qi\u03bd /Q\u03b3 ) stands for the ratio of -at the sourceemissivities of the particular kind of neutrinos i = \u03bc, e, \u03c4 or their antineutrinos, and\n\u03b3-rays. This ratio depends on the value of the photon spectral index, which (before\nabsorption of \u03b3-rays proceeds) is to be shared by the neutrino spectrum. The most\nrecent derivation of ki has been presented by Cavassinni et al. (2006), using the\nnumerical package PYTHIA. Details of the prescription we use below and the way\nin which it was derived can be found there. Galactic distances are much larger\nthan the neutrino oscillation length for energies around TeV. Then, flavor oscillation probabilities have to be considered in computing the neutrino flux at Earth.\nAfter propagation in vacuum, the original neutrino flux will be modified according\nP\nto Fi = j=e,\u03bc,\u03c4 Pi j F 0j , where F 0j is the expected neutrino flux in the absence of\noscillations, and Pi j the probabilities of inter-conversion among neutrino flavors\n(Cavassinni et al. 2006). Assuming that the CP violating phase is negligible (e.g.,\nConstantini and Vissani 2005), oscillations almost completely isotropize the signal, and generate a non-negligible \u03bd\u03c4 flux at Earth, even when it is negligible at the\nsource.\nTaking into account the measured (average) MAGIC spectrum of \u03b3-rays, the\npredicted neutrino fluxes at the source out of this spectrum, following the previously commented derivation, are\n\uf8eb 0 \uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec F\u03bd\u03bc \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7 \uf8ec\uf8ec 9.72 \u00d7 10\u221213 \uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8f7 \u0012\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec 0 \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7 \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\u0013\u22122.6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec F\u03bd\u0304\u03bc \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7 \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec 9.72 \u00d7 10\u221213 \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7 E\u03bd\nTeV\u22121 cm\u22122 s\u22121 ,\n(10)\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec 0 \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7 = \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec 5.40 \u00d7 10\u221213 \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 TeV\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed F\u03bde \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u221213\n0\n4.85 \u00d7 10\nF\u03bd\u0304e\nwhereas the fluxes at Earth after taking into account \u03bd-oscillations are\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\nF \u03bd\u03bc\nF\u03bd\u0304\u03bc\nF \u03bde\nF\u03bd\u0304e\nF \u03bd\u03c4\nF\u03bd\u0304\u03c4\n\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7 \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7 \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7 \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7 \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7 = \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7 \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7 \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\uf8f8 \uf8ec\uf8ed\n\n4.92 \u00d7 10\u221213\n4.81 \u00d7 10\u221213\n5.11 \u00d7 10\u221213\n4.81 \u00d7 10\u221213\n4.93 \u00d7 10\u221213\n4.92 \u00d7 10\u221213\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7 \u0012\n\u0013\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7 E\u03bd \u22122.6\nTeV\u22121 cm\u22122 s\u22121 .\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7 TeV\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\n(11)\n\nErrors in the \u03b3-ray spectrum (about 30% in the normalization and 10% in the slope,\nincluding statistics and systematics in quadrature) would propagate directly into\n\n6\n\n\fthe neutrino flux. It is to be stressed that the latter neutrino fluxes are lower limits\nonly. Since absorption of \u03b3-rays in the stellar photon fields of the binary system\nis unavoidable, in the case of a hadronic production of \u03b3-rays, the neutrino flux\nought to be larger than the \u03b3-ray one (e.g., Aharonian et al. 2005, Christiansen et\nal. 2006). In the case of LS 5039, for instance, Aharonian et al. (2005) studied\nthe potential of such source as a neutrino emitter after the measurement by HESS,\nand proposed that the neutrino flux expected above 1 TeV could be up to a hundred\ntimes larger than the \u03b3-ray flux detected in that energy band. In such an increased\nrange, ANTARES, an experiment with similar effective area for neutrino detection\nthan AMANDA (see below), would be able to test the putative neutrino emission.\nIn the case of LS I +61 303, and in the framework of the hadronic microquasar\nmodel developed by Romero et al. (2003) and Torres et al. (2005), Christiansen et\nal. (2006) reported that the opacity-corrected \u03b3-ray flux above 350 GeV dropped\nfrom 7.1 \u00d7 10\u221211 cm\u22122 s\u22121 to 1.4 \u00d7 10\u221212 cm\u22122 s\u22121 , at the periastron of the system,\ni.e., a reduction by a factor of 50 in \u03b3-ray flux, that would not affect the associated\nneutrino production (we discuss further this model below). Neutrino telescopes\ncan constraint this very factor of enhancement, the neutrino to photon ratio.\n\n5.2 Testing emission scenarios with neutrinos\nIndeed, we argue that the combination of the \u03b3-ray flux measured by MAGIC from\nLS I +61 303 with the existing upper limits from neutrino experiments already\nrestricts the enhancement factor, and thus provides constraints for a hadronic origin\nof the \u03b3-ray radiation from LS I +61 303. We first note that the neutrino flux of\nEq. (11) is consistent with AMANDA-II upper limits on this source (Ackermann\net al. 2005). The latter has been imposed at 90% CL as 2.4 \u00d7 10\u22128 cm\u22122 s\u22121 ,\nintegrated for energies above 10 GeV and assuming an spectral slope of \u22122. The\nquoted limit correspond to the 2000-2002 data sample. This upper limit is not\nvery restrictive, although it is only a factor of 25 larger (disregarding the possible\ndifference that the slope used to obtain it may introduce, which does not affect\nthe concept) than the flux given in Eq. (2). Ackerman has recently presented a\nnew limit from 4 years of AMANDA II data, at a level of 6 \u00d7 10\u22129 cm\u22122 s\u22121 . The\ncombined F\u03bd\u03bc and F\u03bd\u0304\u03bc lower limit flux yielded by LS I +61 303 at Earth as deduced\nin Eq. (11), when integrated above 10 GeV, is only about a factor of 6 smaller than\nthe improved AMANDA-II upper limit. Then, we can compute how much time the\nnext generation of neutrino experiments would need to constrain further a possible\nhadronic emission; i.e., how well can neutrino experiments constrain the neutrino\nto photon ratio.2 To do this, we briefly summarize how to approximately compute\nthe signal and background events for an ICECUBE-like detector.\n\n5.2.1 Neutrino detection\nNeutrino telescopes search for up-going muons produced deep in the Earth, and\nare mainly sensitive to the incoming flux of \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u0304\u03bc . ICECUBE will consist of\n2 If the neutrino spectrum is harder than the photon one (as assumed for instance in the case of LS 5039\nby Aharonian et al. 2005), the neutrino flux would be even larger than just the scaling up of the \u03b3-ray flux,\nso that to impose a constraint over the neutrino to \u03b3-ray ratio, the most conservative choice is that the change\nin spectrum is not significant, which is an assumption we follow. For instance, if the increased neutrino flux\nis due to absorption, the neutrino flux would be similar to the one we use but with a standard E \u22122 spectrum\n(see, e.g., Halzen & Hooper 2005). This will increase the number of events.\n\n7\n\n\fTable 1: Computed neutrino yields for two years of observations in ICECUBE assuming the neutrino to photon ratio is equal to 1.\nOrbital scenario\nSignal Events Background Events\nStrict Periodicity 0.6\n5.0\nModulation\n1.3\n10.0\n\n4800 photomultipliers, arranged on 80 strings placed at depths between 1400 and\n2400 m under the South Pole ice (e.g., Halzen 2006). The strings will be located\nin a regular space grid covering a surface area of 1 km2 . Each string will have\n60 optical modules (OM) spaced 17 m apart. The number of OMs which have\nseen at least one photon (from \u010cerenkov radiation produced by the muon which\nresulted from the interaction of the incoming \u03bd in the earth and ice crust) is called\nthe channel multiplicity, Nch . The multiplicity threshold is set to Nch = 10, which\ncorresponds to an energy threshold of 200 GeV, the same threshold of the MAGIC\n\u03b3-ray observations. The angular resolution of ICECUBE will be \u223c 0.7\u25e6 . A first\nestimation of the event rate of the atmospheric \u03bd-background that will be detected\nin the search bin is given by (e.g., Anchordoqui et al. 2003, Romero & Torres\n2003)\nZ\ndN\nd\u03a6B\nP\u03bd\u2192\u03bc (E\u03bd ) \u2206\u03a9 ,\n(12)\ndE\u03bd\n= Aeff\ndt B\ndE\u03bd\nwhere Aeff is the effective area of the detector, \u2206\u03a9 \u2248 1.5\u00d710\u22124 sr is the angular size\nof the search bin, and d\u03a6B /dE\u03bd . 0.2 (E\u03bd /GeV)\u22123.21 GeV\u22121 cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 is the\n\u03bd\u03bc + \u03bd\u0304\u03bc atmospheric \u03bd-flux (Volkova 1980, Lipari 1993). Here, P\u03bd\u2192\u03bc (E\u03bd ) denotes\nthe probability that a \u03bd of energy E\u03bd on a trajectory through the detector, produces\na muon. For E\u03bd \u223c 1 \u2212 103 GeV, this probability is \u2248 3.3 \u00d7 10\u221213 (E\u03bd /GeV)2.2 ,\nwhereas for E\u03bd > 1 TeV, P\u03bd\u2192\u03bc (E\u03bd ) \u2248 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22126 (E\u03bd /TeV)0.8 (Gaisser et al. 1995).\nOn the other hand, the \u03bd-signal is similarly obtained as\nZ\ndN\n(13)\ndE\u03bd (F\u03bd\u03bc + F\u03bd\u0304\u03bc ) P\u03bd\u2192\u03bc (E\u03bd ) ,\n= Aeff\ndt S\nwhere (F\u03bd\u03bc + F\u03bd\u0304\u03bc ) is the incoming \u03bd\u03bc -flux. In the previous integrals we use both\nexpressions for P\u03bd\u2192\u03bc (E\u03bd ) according to the energy, and integrate from 200 GeV up\nto 10 TeV. The approximate validity of these expressions for the probability can\nbe indirectly verified by the comparison of the neutrino background estimates and\nmeasurements in experiments such as ICECUBE.\n\n5.2.2 Orbital scenarios\nWe consider two phenomenological scenarios based on the currently available\nMAGIC observations. The first one is such that there is an strict orbital periodicity\nof the neutrino emission, with the latter being correlated with the \u03b3-ray maximum\nmeasured by MAGIC (Albert et al. 2005), say, within a period of about 10 days\n(the active time) around phase 0.6 of the orbit. That is, the \u03b3-rays are produced\nduring the time span where they have been detected and there is no production of\n\u03b3-rays at periastron. A scenario where this could happen even in a hadronic description of the \u03b3-ray emission detected is briefly discussed below. A second case\nconsidered here is one in which there is orbital modulation of the \u03b3-ray emission,\n\n8\n\n\fTime [yrs]\n1\n\n2\n\n18\n\n3\n\nPeriodic signal\nModulated signal\n\nMax. \u03bd-\u03b3 ratio in case of bck. detection\n\n16\n\n14\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n14\n\n28\n\n42\n\nNumber of orbital periods\n\nFigure 1: Maximum neutrino to photon ratio compatible with the 95% CL interval for\nthe corresponding neutrino background in the given integration time. See text for a\nmore detailed explanation.\ni.e., \u03b3-rays are emitted along the orbit following the modulation imposed by the\ntarget matter and the absorbing photon fields. The maximum of the neutrino emission would then be naturally expected at periastron, where the \u03b3-ray production\nshould also be maximal but completely or nearly completely quenched by absorption. This increases the active time along the orbit (we consider an active time of\n20 days) when significant neutrino emission proceeds. As a benchmark, we show\nin Table 1 the results of the neutrino yield for background and source events when\nthere is no neutrino to photon enhancement (i.e., photons are not absorbed). In this\nsituation, both for the cases of strict orbital periodicity and for the more relaxed\nmodulated signal, the background greatly dominates the expected number of signal events. The question we pose then is how much enhancement of the neutrino\nto photon ratio would still be compatible with a non-detection of the system in a\nkm3 -observatory.\n\n5.2.3 Numerical results\nTo fix first the numerics given by the current constraints on neutrino emission, we\nconsider that the neutrino flux follows the MAGIC spectrum and is enhanced up to\nthe level constrained by AMANDA-II data (Ackerman 2006). In this situation, in\nthe case of periodicity, the signal events for energies below 1 TeV in a detector such\nas ICECUBE during each orbital active time is 0.07 (with expected background,\ncomputed as explained above, of 0.12), whereas it is again 0.07 (but with background 0.05) for energies above 1 TeV. These quantities maybe slightly increased\n\n9\n\n\fin a more comprehensive treatment of the detector, what we explore below. In the\ncase of modulation, these quantities are (at least) a factor of 2 larger, given that\nthe signal and background are proportional to the integration time. In one year\nwe have 14 LS I +61 303 orbits, such that we expect about 2 signal events at all\nenergies against 2.5 of background in the case of periodicity; or 4 signal events at\nall energies against a background of 5, in the case of modulation. Detecting, in\njust one year, only the expected number of background events or less, i.e., apparently no signal, in any of the cases mentioned, would then discard the theoretically\npredicted signal at the 68% CL (Feldman & Cousins 1998).\nInstead of fixing a priori the level of enhancement of the neutrino over the \u03b3-ray\nflux, it can be consider as a variable upon which constraints can be imposed from\ndata. The 95% confidence level interval for the mean number of 1-year signal\nevents in the case the number of detected events is equal to the expected background is [0.00,5.75] and [0.00,6.26], for the periodicity and modulation cases, respectively. The amplification factor between the neutrino and photon fluxes is then\nlimited to that which produces an expected signal that is smaller than the upper end\nof these intervals. We obtain \u223c18 and \u223c10, respectively. In one year, then, a negative ICECUBE result for LS I +61 303 (i.e., a detection of a number of neutrino\nevents that is compatible with the background expectation and are coming, within\nexperimental uncertainty, from the direction of LS I +61 303) would imply that the\namplification factor between the neutrino and \u03b3-ray flux is severely constrained. In\naddition, the level of constraint will grow with additional observation time. Figure\n1 describes this improvement. As time goes by, the number of orbital periods that\nare integrated is larger. This increases the background and signal events expected\nfrom the theoretical assumptions. If just background events continue to be measured, Feldman & Cousins' (1998) Table 4 and 5 gives the upper end of the 95%\nCL interval for the mean number of signal events that is still in agreement with the\nexperimental data. Assuming that the neutrino flux is enhanced from that coming\nfrom the \u03b3-ray spectrum measured, the maximum neutrino to photon ratio that is\ncompatible with the upper end of that 95% CL interval is obtained using Eq. (13).\nThis is what is plotted on the y-axis of the Figure 1. After a few years of observations of just the background neutrino events, the enhancement of the neutrino over\nthe \u03b3-ray flux allowed is so low that theoretical models accounting for typical \u03b3-\u03b3\nabsorption (e.g., see Christiansen et al. 2006) cannot accommodate it. Hadronic\nproduction of \u03b3-rays would thus be indirectly ruled out, with growing confidence.\nAlternatively, we can of course find the reverse result: the predicted (lower limit)\nsignal from LS I +61 303 in muon neutrinos could lead to its discovery in ICECUBE.\n\n5.2.4 A more detailed treatment of the detector\nIn Figure 2 we show the event rate above an energy threshold, shown on the horizontal axis using a more detailed numerical description of the ICECUBE detector.\nSpecifically, in this (alternative) calculation we obtain the neutrino flux using the\nbolometric method (Alvarez-Muniz & Halzen 2002) that i) describes the spectra\nassuming the pionic origin of both gammas and neutrinos and ii) imposes equal\nenergy in the flux of neutral and charged pions.We subsequently calculate the number of \u03bd\u03bc induced neutrino tracks in IceCube using the semianalytical calculation\npresented by Gonzalez-Garcia, Halzen & Maltoni (2005) with quality cuts on the\nIceCube data referred to as level 2 cuts by Ahrens et al. (2003).

When the spectra have equal high energy\nslopes, this method will reproduce our previous results, i.e., can be seen that these\nresults agrees well with the result already quoted above, where an effective area of\na kilometer squared has been assumed. If we assume that the gamma-ray flux is\nsteeper than the neutrino flux because of cascading, we get larger numbers for the\nneutrino predictions. These are also shown in the plot.\n\n5.2.5 Electron neutrinos\nA concomitant way of looking for neutrinos from LS I +61 303 would be the\ndetection of electron neutrinos (see, e.g., Section IIB of Anchordoqui & Halzen\n2005 for details and formulae). The angular resolution of ICECUBE for the detection of such neutrinos is not yet known but expected to several degrees (say,\nseveral degrees) although with very large tails. That means that for a fraction of\nthe events, say half, it may be similar to the AMANDA \u03bd\u03bc distribution: For those\nevents with low uncertainty in angular position, the background increase because\nof the larger integration region would be compensated by the reduced atmospheric\n\u03bde background (a factor of \u223c20 when compared with \u03bd\u03bc at 1 TeV), thus probably\nproducing a similar confidence signal. The putative detection of LS I +61 303 in\ntwo different channels would provide further confirmation of the hadronic origin of\nthe high energy radiation. Interesting to note in this case is that the acceptance in\nshowers is 4\u03c0 and ICECUBE would be able see the Southern micro-quasars as well\n\n11\n\n\f6\n\nDiscussion\n\nNote that for the former computations we have not made use of any particular\nmodel of the source or the nature of the system. Whatever they are, if the origin\nof the MAGIC-detected gamma-ray emission is hadronic, the neutrino to photon\nratio can be constrained by ICECUBE, we have shown. We now briefly discuss our\nresults in relation to published models of hadronic interpretations for LS I +61 303.\nStill, as we mentioned, a hadronic modelization of this system as a pulsar wind \u2013\nstellar wind interaction is not available, so we focus on microquasar models.\nA model of \u03b3-ray and neutrino emission from microquasars based on hadronic\ninteractions of relativistic protons in the jet with stellar wind ions have been proposed by Romero et al. (2003) and Torres et al. (2005). This kind of modelling has\nseveral free parameters and embedded assumptions, and in order to test its viability, it is of interest to compare the obtained results with the report of the MAGIC\ndetection of LS I +61 303. The specific application of the quoted model to LS\nI +61 303 has been developed by Romero et al. (2005) and Christiansen et al.\n(2006). A prediction of this model as obtained in the previous works is that the\nmaximum of the \u03b3-ray radiation is to be found at periastron (even when considering in some detail the orbital dependence of \u03b3-\u03b3 absorption, which is also maximal\nthere). This is not supported by MAGIC results, which have only imposed upper\nlimits at this orbital phase and found that the maximum of the emission is instead\nshifted to the phases where the radio and X-ray maxima are also located, after\nthe periastron passage. Is this fact enough to rule out this particular hadronic interpretation (i.e., in the framework of the wind-jet interacting model) in favor of\nleptonic ones (e.g., Bednarek 2006)? In applying the hadronic modelling to LS I\n+61 303, and in order to motivate a hadronic interpretation, Romero et al. (2005)\nhave emphasized the anti-correlation of the GeV and radio emission reported by\nMassi 2004. This, however, overestimates the goodness and orbital coverage of\nEGRET data on LS I +61 303. The typical EGRET viewing period has a similar\nduration than the timescale that is to be tested, i.e., the orbital period, which casts\ndoubts upon the resulting anti-correlation even if all other caveats (e.g., smallness\nof the data sample and errors for each of the lightcurve points) were to be put aside.\nEGRET data can be used to claim variability of the emission in monthly timescales\n(Torres et al. 2001, Nolan et al. 2003), and even that is not conclusive due to the\nlarge error bars of each of the flux data points. Assigning a precise orbital modulation at the GeV regime is clearly a task for GLAST. The former satellite will have\na sensitivity about 30-50 times better than EGRET, and in a matter of days will\nbe able to detect the weakest of the EGRET sources. Recent simulations (Dubois\n2006) show that GLAST will be able to follow the variabilty of LS I +61 303 in\nintra-orbit integrations, demonstrating the ability to detect the period of the system,\nshould the GeV emission be correlated (or anti-correlated) with it. Massi (2004)\nproposed that the EGRET maximum is correlated with the periastron of the system and Romero et al. and Christiansen et al. used this fact, requiring that the\nGeV flux at periastron is consistent with the EGRET measurement, in order to fix\na free phenomenological parameter that accounts for some wind particles being\nunable to diffuse into the microquasar jet. This parameter (so-called f p ) linearly\naffects the computation of the \u03b3-ray (and neutrino) luminosity. f p was therefore\nchosen to be 0.1 all along the orbit, this reduces one order of magnitude the otherwise predicted GeV and TeV luminosity. The parameter f p is ad-hoc, thus, it is\nnot defined by any formula. It is likely that several effects can impede wind ions\n\n12\n\n\fto enter (diffuse) into the jet. Shock formation on the boundary layers or partial\nalignment between jet and wind, are examples. For instance, by comparing the\ndiffusion and convection timescales it can be seen that efficient diffusion of ions\ninto the jet is only possible when the wind blows from the side (Torres et al. 2004).\nThus, if the wind-jet inclination changes with time, either by geometry or wind\ndynamics, the efficiency in the diffusion of particles will also change. But these\neffects may not be constant along the orbit. In fact, there is no reason to expect so\nwhen the wind velocity at the impact with the jet, the accretion rate, the distance\nbetween stars, and the wind density all significantly vary (order of magnitude) between periastron (phase 0.23) and the \u03b3-ray maximum (phase \u223c 0.6). In addition\nalso the jet inclination with respect of the stellar wind flow, particularly if the latter\nis not strictly confined to the orbital plane, or if the angle of confinement change\nrandomly, may change with time. Just phenomenologically, then, if the penetration factor f p changes significantly from 0 to 1 along the orbit, even in a hadronic\nmodel, both strict periodicity (as commented in the previous section), and thus,\nno radiation at periastron, and a modulated scenario with emission all along the\norbit are possible. This is a conceptually new possibility for hadronic models in\nmicroquasars, which may even be useful for other cases should the nature of LS I\n+61 303 finally reveals as jetless, where radiation is quenched not because of the\nexistence of large stellar fields and thus an increased opacity, but rather because of\na modulation of the target matter. This reminds of collective stellar wind models (Romero & Torres 2003, Domingo-Santamar\u0131\u0301a & Torres 2006). The fact that\nthe phases at which the \u03b3-ray maxima occurs is located at the second maximum\nof the accretion rate over the compact object3 provides the needed target matter\nfor a hadronic interpretation of the \u03b3-ray detection at this orbital phase (provided\nthe diffusion is efficient, f p \u223c 1), whereas it reduces the resulting enhancement\nfactor between the neutrino and \u03b3-ray flux (due to the reduced level of \u03b3-\u03b3 opacity\nfound far from the periastron of the system). This implies that longer integration\ntimes in neutrino telescopes such as ICECUBE are needed to reach ruling-out levels in the strict periodicity scenario (consistent with Fig. 1). Additional sources\nof opacity at periastron would decrease the level of \u03b3-ray flux, but increase the\nneutrino-to-photon ratio; ICECUBE will be able to test this possibility. Further\nMAGIC observations as well as ICECUBE results on LS I+61 303, a comparison\nof these with the results of the previous section, and a more detailed implementation of the conceptual ideas about suppression of target matter at periastron, will\nhelp further constrain, or finally rule out, a hadronic interpretation for this system.\n\nAcknowledgements\nDFT thanks Luis Anchordoqui and Eva Domingo-Santamar\u0131\u0301a and his colleagues of\nthe MAGIC collaboration, especially W.
