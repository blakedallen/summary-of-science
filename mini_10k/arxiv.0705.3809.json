Employing a skeleton expansion, we \u001cnd that the infrared\nbehavior is qualitatively independent of the spa etime dimension d. In the ases d = 2, 3 and 4\neven the quantitative results for the infrared exponents of the verti es di\u001ber only slightly. Therefore,\norresponding latti e simulations provide interesting qualitative information for the physi al ase.\nWe furthermore \u001cnd that the loop integrals depend only weakly on the numeri al values of the IR\nexponents.\n\nThe infrared (IR) regime of Yang-Mills theory determines the fundamental non-perturbative properties of the non-Abelian gauge dynami s. In parti ular, the IR limit of Greens fun tions\nof the olored \u001celds are likely onne ted to the problem of on\u001cnement as demonstrated within the\ns enarios of Kugo-Ojima [1\u2104 and Gribov-Zwanziger [2, 3\u2104. Due to the intri ate nature of the problem an\ninvestigation via all available methods is desirable. Su h ombined e\u001borts via Dyson-S hwinger equations\n(DSE) [4, 5, 6, 7\u2104, renormalization group (RG) te hniques [8\u2104 and latti e gauge theory studies [9\u2104 led\nduring the last years to a oherent pi ture of the infrared regime in Landau gauge. Hereby, in the\nontinuum approa hes, the IR s aling limit of general Greens fun tions in four spa etime dimensions has\nbeen determined [10\u2104. It exhibits, as argued for in [11\u2104, a dominan e of the gauge \u001cxing part of the a tion,\ni.e. the Faddeev-Popov ghost. A simultaneous analysis of DSE and RG methods allowed furthermore to\nshow that this IR \u001cxpoint is unique [12\u2104.\nThe Greens fun tions of Yang-Mills theory in Landau gauge are studied extensively on the latti e,\nsee e.g. [9\u2104. These analyses show the IR in rease of the ghost dressing fun tion required in both the\nKugo-Ojima and the Gribov-Zwanziger s enario, as well as the IR s aling of the gluon dressing fun tion\nin a ordan e with DSE and RG analyses. The in\u001duen e of \u001cnite volume orre tions has been studied\nwithin DSE analyses on ompa t manifolds [13\u2104 whi h agree qualitatively with the \u001cnite IR limit of\nurrent latti e results. However, a on\u001crmation that even the gluon propagator vanishes weakly in the IR,\nwhi h is ne essary in the Gribov-Zwanziger s enario, has not yet been possible in four-dimensional latti e\nsimulations due to the large latti e sizes required to probe the IR regime. The situation is similar for the\nimportant but even harder determination of the s aling behavior of vertex fun tions or the quantitative\nextra tion of IR exponent. Lower dimensional latti es ould allow to test qualitative aspe ts of these\nGreens fun tions in a substantially simpler setting. Naturally, su h a surrogate study requires that the\ngeneri features are identi al to those in four-dimensional spa etime. Re ent latti e studies in two [14\u2104\nand three spa etime dimensions [15\u2104 indeed suggest a power-law behavior similar to the four dimensional\nase.\nSU (N ) Yang-Mills theory in three spa etime dimensions is also relevant from two other points of\nview. In the high temperature limit only the lowest Matsubara mode ontributes, leading to a dimensional\nredu tion and thus to an e\u001be tive \u001celd theory in three dimensions. The qualitative aspe ts of this e\u001be tive\ntheory, in parti ular with regard to its on\u001cning nature, may be overed by ordinary three-dimensional\ngauge theory [16\u2104. Similarly, Yang-Mills theory in the anoni al quantization approa h in Coulomb gauge\nIntrodu tion:\n\n1\n\n\f[17\u2104 with an appropriate hoi e for the va uum wave fun tional is stru turally similar to the orresponding\nthree-dimensional theory in Landau gauge.\nThese results motivate to study the dependen e of the infrared limit on the parameters of the theory in\nmore detail. It will turn out that the infrared solution of Yang-Mills theory is determined by the spa etime\ndimension d and one parameter \u03ba that determines the IR exponents of propagators and verti es. In this\nwork we establish a manifest power ounting s heme for general vertex fun tions of Landau gauge YangMills theory in arbitrary dimensions. We \u001cnd qualitatively similar results as in the four-dimensional\nanalysis given in [10\u2104. Furthermore we dis uss the dependen e of the Dyson-S hwinger equations on the\ninfrared s aling parameter \u03ba. In four dimensions it takes a value \u03ba \u2248 0.595 within an approximation\nbased on the propagator DSEs and using a bare ghost-gluon vertex. A possible dressing of this vertex\nould hange this value slightly [6\u2104. Therefore we study to what extent these dynami al building blo ks\nin the DSEs depend on \u03ba, employing an analysis of the IR-dominant integrals.\nIR exponents for arbitrary d: In the following we will perform a s aling analysis for the IR regime\nof Yang-Mills theory in arbitrary dimensions. In ontrast to the generi IR limit we study the limit\nwhere the oupling g is kept \u001cxed and has no inherent s aling dependen e. Instead in dimensions other\nthan four it \u001cxes the fundamental s ale of the theory. This limit is more dire tly a essible in latti e\nsimulations and has been analyzed in [14, 15\u2104. A similar IR analysis has previously been performed for\nthe physi ally important ase d = 4 in refs. [10, 12\u2104. Although the s aling in arbitrary dimension may be\nabstra ted from these results via the onsideration of the appropriate anoni al s aling dimensons, we\nhose to give a on ise and nevertheless self- ontained derivation of the general s aling relations and refer\nthe reader to the orresponding work for details. We note, that our analysis is immediately appli able\nto the gauge se tor of QCD sin e losed quark loops are IR-suppressed due to the \u001cnite urrent quark\nmasses [18\u2104 and therefore there are no quark ontributions to purely bosoni Greens fun tions in the IR\nregime. This has been veri\u001ced in ref. [19\u2104.\nAnalog to the orresponding analysis in four dimensions [10\u2104, the starting point for the IR analysis is the\nnon-renormalization of the ghost-gluon vertex in Landau gauge [20\u2104, whi h implies a \u001cnite vertex in the\ninfrared [10\u2104. This property depends purely on the transversality of the gluon propagator and is, as long\nas the ghost-gluon s attering kernel is not strongly IR-divergent, therefore valid in arbitrary dimensions.\nWe ome ba k to this point below.\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\n=\n\n-\n\nFigure 1: The DSE for the ghost propagator.\nThe infrared behavior of the propagators and verti es well below its inherent s ale g 2/(4\u2212d) (respe tively\n\u039bQCD in d = 4) is determined via renormalization group arguments by s aling relations.

We dis uss this point further below.\nIn order to transform the in\u001cnite hierar hy of Dyson-S hwinger equations into a losed system we\nperform a skeleton expansion. This yields an in\u001cnite tower of graphs involving only primitively divergent\nverti es whi h we will analyze in a \u001crst step. The \u001crst order of the skeleton expansion of the DSE for the\nthree-gluon vertex is depi ted in \u001cg. 2. We start with the ghost triangle whi h turns out to be one of the\ninfrared leading diagrams. We have d/2 from the integral, 3(\u2212\u03ba\u22121) from the three ghost propagators and\n3/2 from the three ghost-gluon verti es. We subtra t the anoni al dimension 1/2 to get the anomalous\nIR exponent of the ghost triangle of the three-gluon vertex:\ngh\u2206\n\u03b40,3\n=\n\nd\n1 1\nd\n+ 3(\u2212\u03ba \u2212 1) + 3 \u2212 = \u22123\u03ba + \u2212 2 .\n2\n2 2\n2\n\n(6)\n\nFor the four-gluon vertex we an apply the same pro edure. In \u001cg. 3 we show the \u001crst order of its\nskeleton expansion. Here, also the ghost re tangle gives one of the IR dominant ontributions. Simple\nounting of the powers yields for the IR exponent of this diagram\ngh\u0003\n\u03b40,4\n=\n\nd\n1\nd\n+ 4(\u2212\u03ba \u2212 1) + 4 = \u22124\u03ba + \u2212 2 .\n2\n2\n2\n\n(7)\n\nNow we are in the position to derive the IR exponents of the other diagrams of the three-gluon vertex\nDSE in \u001cg. 2. The gluon triangle ontains three propagators as well as two dressed and one bare threegluon vertex, so in luding the loop integral and subtra ting the anoni al dimension the IR exponent is\nd/2 + 3(2\u03ba + 1 \u2212 d/2) + 2(\u22123\u03ba + d/2 \u2212 3/2) + 1/2 \u2212 1/2 = 0.

The same holds for the four-gluon vertex. In general, the IR exponents of these purely gluoni\ndiagrams are independent of the dimension and therefore identi al to eqs.

The IR power laws, eq. (16), are then valid for momenta p2 \u226a g 4/(4\u2212d) . The resulting momentum\ndependent ouplings from the ghost-gluon vertex, \u03b1gh , the three-gluon vertex, \u03b13g , and the four gluon\nvertex, \u03b14g , (see [10\u2104 for a de\u001cnition) are then given by\ng2\n[Z2,1 (p2 )]2 G2 (p2 ) Z(p2 ) \u2212\u2212\n\u2212\u2192 (p2 )(4\u2212d)/2 ,\n4\u03c0\np2 \u21920\ng2\n\u03b13g (p2 ) =\n[Z0,3 (p2 )]2 Z 3 (p2 ) \u2212\u2212\n\u2212\u2192 (p2 )(4\u2212d)/2 ,\n4\u03c0\np2 \u21920\ng2\n[Z0,4 (p2 )] Z 2 (p2 ) \u2212\u2212\n\u2212\u2192 (p2 )(4\u2212d)/2 .\n\u03b14g (p2 ) =\n4\u03c0\np2 \u21920\n\n\u03b1gh (p2 ) =\n\n(17)\n(18)\n(19)\n\nHere Z2,1 denotes the dressing fun tion of the tree-level stru ture of the ghost-gluon vertex and Z0,3\nand Z0,4 the orresponding dressing fun tions of the three- and four-gluon verti es, respe tively. To\nobtain these results the s aling laws, eq. (16), have been used. From this one may better understand the\nusefulness of the skeleton expansion: apart from B all diagrammati pie es given above ontain dressing\nfa tors of the same multipli ity as the ouplings, f. eqs. (17-19). Thus all anomalous dimensions\nan el and the anoni al dimension (4 \u2212 d)/2 of these ouplings is an elled by the anoni al dimensions\nand the extra loop. As a result the skeleton expansion indeed works independent of the value of the\nspa etime dimension d as ould have been expe ted from the previously studied four-dimensional ase\n[4, 5, 6, 10, 12\u2104.\nFinally, let us ompare the IR behavior of the Yang-Mills Greens fun tions in di\u001berent dimensions.\nThe orresponding values for the IR exponent \u03ba (using a bare ghost-gluon vertex) are displayed in \u001cg. 4.\nApart from the region d < 1 we always have two possible values, whi h arise from an IR analysis of the\nghost and gluon propagator DSEs. We show the IR exponents of the ghost and gluon propagators and\nthe three- and four-gluon verti es in table 2. Whereas the situation in four dimensions is not on lusive,\nyet, the solutions belonging to the \u001crst bran h in \u001cg. 4 have been found in latti e studies in two and three\ndimensions. These results for the IR exponents of the propagators, the ghost-gluon vertex [22\u2104 and the\nthree-gluon vertex in two dimensions [14\u2104 agree within errors with the orresponding values given in table\n2. One an see that for this bran h the qualitative behavior does not hange in di\u001berent dimensions. The\nother bran h in \u001cg. 4 that starts at \u03ba = \u22121 for d = 0 and ends at \u03ba = 2 for d = 6 has not been seen in\nlatti e simulations. We will give some additional arguments below that this bran h may be unphysi al.\n6\n\n\fThe Dyson-S hwinger equations involve\nloop integrals over bare and dressed vertex fun tions. As just dis ussed the orresponding dressing\nfun tions exhibit a power law with appropriate infrared exponents. The orresponding oe\u001e ients depend\non the IR exponent \u03ba. For the respe tive oe\u001e ients of the propagators, eq. (2), whi h an be omputed\nfrom the 2-point integral, eq. (3), this \u03ba-dependen e is shown in \u001cg. 5, where \u03ba-independent prefa tors\nhave been dropped. The physi al requirement that the dressing fun tions have to be positive restri ts the\npossible values of \u03ba to \u03ba \u2264 0.5 in two, 0.25 < \u03ba \u2264 0.75 in three and \u03ba > 0.5 in four dimensions [23\u2104. We\nnote that all known solutions ful\u001cll these requirements. The de isive point is, however, that although the\nurves in \u001cg. 5 di\u001ber onsiderable, the physi al values obtained from the Dyson-S hwinger solution are\nfar away from these poles and thereby the \u03ba-dependen e in their vi inity is rather mild and qualitatively\nsimilar in ea h ase.\nDependen e of the loop integrals on the IR-exponent:\n\n1\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\n0.3\n\n0.6\n0.2\n\nc2,0\n\n0.4\n0.2\n\nc0,2 0.1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n-0.4\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n\u03ba\n\n0.6\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n\u03ba\n\nFigure 5: The \u03ba-dependen e of the unrenormalized dressing integrals appearing in the DSEs for the ghost\n(left) and gluon propagator (right).

However, there are general methods to de ompose su h tensor integrals\nto standard s alar integrals [24\u2104.

A general expression for su h s alar 1-loop 3-point integrals in arbitrary\ndimensions and with arbitrary powers of the propagators has been obtained in [21, 25\u2104. An expli it\nevaluation of this result requires an expression for the resulting Appell fun tion F4 whose de\u001cning series\ndoes not onverge in the onsidered Eu lidean regime.

Here we will merely dis uss the dependen e of the\noverlap of the tree-level tensor with the IR-dominant ghost triangle. A ording to the dis ussed power\nounting, the ghost loop presents the IR-leading ontribution to the Dyson S hwinger equation for the\nthree-gluon vertex in \u001cg. 2. Sin e this loop involves only ghost-gluon verti es that remain bare to leading\norder, its IR behavior an be analyzed semi-perturbatively using the s aling form of the dressed ghost\npropagators, see eq. (2). We onsider the spe ial kinemati on\u001cguration given by the symmetri point\np2 = q 2 = r2 . At this point the dressing fun tion of the leading ghost loop orre tion to the threegluon integral s ales a ording to eq.

These zeros depend on the kinemati on\u001cguration and\nappear at higher values of \u03ba away from the symmetri point. (The orresponding s alar integrals, f. eq.\n(20), feature even poles at these values of \u03ba whi h pre isely an el for the tree-level tensor.) A ording\nto eq. (18) su h zeros in the vertex dressing fun tion would lead to an IR-vanishing oupling. Sin e\nYang-Mills theory is apparently a strongly intera ting theory, this indi ates that these solutions might\nnot be physi ally relevant. As in the ase of the propagators the \u03ba dependen e in the vi inity of the\nsolutions of the \u001crst bran h is similar in all dimensions. The negative value of the three-gluon vertex in\ntwo dimensions nevertheless leads to a positive IR limit of the oupling \u03b13g in eq. (18). However, it would\nause problems in its renormalization group \u001dow and might be an artifa t of the skeleton expansion and\nured by higher orders.\nCon lusions: We have studied generi features of the IR limit of SU (N ) Yang-Mills theory established\nin [4, 6, 7, 10\u2104 in more detail. As in the four-dimensional ase, the IR behavior of Greens fun tions an be\nextra ted via a skeleton expansion in arbitrary dimensions. We \u001cnd that the IR limit of Greens fun tions is\nsurprisingly insensitive on the spa etime dimension. This already onstitutes the \u001crst important result of\nthis study. As a onsequen e Yang-Mills theory in lower dimensions has a qualitatively similar IR limit as\nthe four dimensional theory. Thus the on\u001cnement me hanism might possess identi al features in di\u001berent\n\n8\n\n\fdimensions. Corresponding latti e simulations should provide interesting qualitative information for the\nphysi al ase. Indeed a re ent study on large two dimensional latti es [14\u2104 \u001cnds infrared exponents in\nagreement with the value \u03ba = 0.2 , thus on\u001crming the Gribov-Zwanziger s enario also in two dimensions.\nThe results on the mild \u03ba-dependen e of the remaining DSE solutions suggest that ghost dominan e\nis a rather robust me hanism and should not depend on the details of the employed trun ation s heme.\nThis is further substantiated by the fa t that the main non-linearities in the DSE system, whi h enable\nthe non-trivial \u001cxpoint, arise in the propagator equations whereas there is no non-linear feedba k to\nleading order in the vertex equations.\nA knowledgements: We are grateful to A.
