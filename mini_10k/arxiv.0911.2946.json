First of all, it is an interest\nto axions as hypothetical particles, which appear in the context of the strong CP-violation\nproblem and spontaneous breaking of symmetry in the early universe (see, e.g., [1, 2] for\nreview and basic references), and which are considered as one of the Dark Matter candidates\n(see, e.g., [3, 4] and references therein). The direct detection of the axions is formulated to\nbe one of goals of modern experiments in High Energy Physics (see, e.g., [5]).\nThe second reason is connected with an interest to the theoretical concept of pseudoscalar\nfield \u03c6 (axion field) associated with pseudoscalar-photon interaction. This occurs first in the\nstudy of electromagnetism and equivalence principles [6, 7, 8]. This concept is a base for the\nso-called Einstein-Maxwell-axion theory, Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion theory and their\ngeneralizations (see, e.g., [6]-[18]).\nOne of the most significant item in the theory of axion fields is the problem of interaction of electromagnetic and pseudoscalar (axion) fields, the well-known application of the\nphoton-axion coupling being the effect of polarization rotation [6, 19, 20] in the observations of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation (see, e.g., [21, 22] and references\ntherein). Several groups are working on the experiments with vacuum birefringence and\nvacuum dichroism to look for the photon-axion coupling [23]-[26].\nIt is well-known that the standard effect of optical activity induced by the axion field\ntakes place when the pseudoscalar field \u03c6 has a non-vanishing four-gradient [8, 27], i.e. when\n\u2202k \u03c6 6= 0. This effect can be described in the framework of classical electrodynamics in terms\nof linear constitutive equations [8, 27, 28], linking an excitation tensor H ik and the Maxwell\ntensor Fmn . When the pseudo-scalar field is constant, \u03c6 = \u03c60 , and thus does not contribute\nto the vacuum Maxwell equations, new possibilities for the axion-photon interaction exist:\none of them is discussed in the work [29], which focuses on reflection and transmission of\na wave at an interface between two media. We discuss here another possibility related to\nnon-minimal optical activity induced by photon-axion coupling, which also can occur in the\ncase of a constant pseudoscalar field.\nThe standard description of the non-minimal coupling of the gravitational field with\nscalar, electromagnetic and gauge fields is based on the introduction of specific cross-terms\ninto the Lagrangian, which contain the Riemann tensor Rikmn , the Ricci tensor, Rkn , and\nRicci scalar, R, on the one hand, and the corresponding fields and their derivatives, on the\nother hand. The theory of non-minimal coupling is elaborated in detail for the scalar field\n(real and complex fields, as well as Higgs multiplets)(see, e.g., [30] for review and references).\nSpecial attention in these investigations is focused on two models, the first of them has the\n\u03beR\u03a62 coupling, and the second has the so-called non-minimal derivative coupling [31]-[33].\nThe study of a non-minimal coupling of gravity with electromagnetic field started in [34] and\nthis theory has been developed by many authors (see, e.g., [35]-[48]). The generalization of\nthe idea of non-minimal interactions to the case of torsion coupled to the electromagnetic\nfield has been made in [49, 50]. Exact solutions in the framework of non-minimal EinsteinYang-Mills and Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theories are discussed in [51]-[56].\nIn this paper we focus on the non-minimal generalization of the Einstein-Maxwell-axion\n2\n\n\ftheory. The derivation of master equations is fulfilled in analogy with non-minimal scalar\nfield theory and non-minimal electromagnetic field theory. The items which are specific for\nthe pseudoscalar field theory are discussed in detail. The paper is organized as follows. In\nsection 2, we discuss a formalism of non-minimal Einstein-Maxwell-axion theory; a brief\nintroduction to the minimal theory is given in subsection 2.1; the non-minimal extension of\nthe Lagrangian and the derivation of the corresponding master equations are presented in\nsubsection 2.2; subsection 2.3 contains the description of the model in terms of constitutive\nequations. In section 3 we apply the obtained master equations to the models with pp-wave\nsymmetry and discuss examples of the exact solutions for the gravitational, pseudoscalar\nand electromagnetic fields. In section 4 we consider the propagation of test electromagnetic\nwaves coupled to pseudoscalar field in the pp-wave background and focus on the effect of\nnon-minimal optical activity induced by the axion field. In section 5 we summarize the\nresults.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nNon-minimal coupling of gravitational,\nelectromagnetic and axion fields\nMinimal model as a starting point\n\nIn order to explain the novelty of our approach, let us first introduce the case of gravitationalelectromagnetic-axion fields minimally coupled. The simplest minimal action functional is\nS(M) =\n\nZ\n\n\u0015\n\u221a \u0014 R 1 mn\n1 \u2217mn\nmn\n2\n2\nd x \u2212g\n+ F Fmn + \u03c6F\nFmn \u2212g \u2207m \u03c6\u2207n \u03c6+m(A) \u03c6 ,\n\u03ba 2\n2\n4\n\n(1)\n\nwhere g is the determinant of the metric tensor gik , \u2207m is a covariant derivative, R is the\nRicci scalar. The Maxwell tensor Fmn is given by\nFmn \u2261 \u2207m An \u2212 \u2207n Am ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Am is an electromagnetic potential four-vector; F \u2217mn \u2261 21 \u01ebmnpq Fpq is the tensor dual\nto Fpq ; \u01ebmnpq \u2261 \u221a1\u2212g E mnpq is the Levi-Civita tensor, E mnpq is the absolutely antisymmetric\nLevi-Civita symbol with E 0123 = 1. The dual Maxwell tensor satisfies the condition\n\u2207k F \u2217ik = 0 .\n\n(3)\n\nThe first term in the brackets is the Hilbert-Einstein Lagrangian; the second term is the\nstandard Lagrangian for an electromagnetic field; the third term is the pseudoscalar-photon\ninteraction Lagrangian [6, 7, 8]; the fourth and fifth terms constitute the pseudoscalar Lagrangian.\nThe symbol \u03c6 stands for a pseudoscalar field; this quantity is dimensionless providing the\nterms 21 F mn Fmn and 12 \u03c6F \u2217mn Fmn to have the same dimensionality. The axion field itself, \u03a6,\nis considered to be proportional to this quantity \u03a6 = \u03a80 \u03c6 with a constant \u03a80 . In order to\nsimplify the calculations we replace the potential of electromagnetic field Ai with the term\n8\u03c0G\u03a82\nAi /\u03a80 , and consider the constant \u03ba to be equal to \u03ba = c4 0 . The term m(A) is proportional\n3\n\n\fto a (hypothetical) mass of an axion, m(A) = 2\u03c0c m(axion) /h; h is the Planck constant. We\nuse the signature + \u2212 \u2212\u2212.\nThe variation of the action functional (1) with respect to the four-vector potential Ai\ngives the minimal (vacuum) Maxwell equations\ni\n\nh\n\n\u2207k F ik + \u03c6F \u2217ik = 0 ,\n\n(4)\n\n\u2207k F ik + F \u2217ik \u2207k \u03c6 = 0\n\n(5)\n\nwhich can be transformed into\n\ndue to the equation (3). Equivalently, equation (4) can be written as\n\u2207k H ik = 0 ,\n\nH ik = C ikmn Fmn ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere C ikmn is the constitutive tensor\nC ikmn =\n\n\u0011\n1 \u0010 im kn\n1\ng g \u2212 g in g km + \u03c6\u01ebikmn ,\n2\n2\n\n(7)\n\nand H ik is the excitation tensor [8, 27]. Minimal equations for the axion field can be obtained\nfrom the action (1) by the variation with respect to the pseudoscalar field \u03c6, yielding\ni\n1\n\u2207k \u2207k +m2(A) \u03c6 = \u2212 F \u2217mn Fmn .\n4\n\nh\n\n(8)\n\nMinimal equations for the gravitational field obtained by the variation of (1) with respect\nto metric g ik are\nh\ni\n1\n(EM)\n(A)\nRik \u2212 Rgik = \u03ba Tik + Tik .\n(9)\n2\n(EM)\n\nHere Tik\n\nis the standard stress-energy tensor of pure electromagnetic field:\n(EM)\n\nTik\n\n1\n\u2261 gik F mn Fmn \u2212 Fim Fk m ,\n4\n\n(10)\n\n(A)\n\nand Tik , given by\ni\n1 h\n(A)\nTik \u2261 \u2207i \u03c6\u2207k \u03c6 \u2212 gik \u2207m \u03c6\u2207m \u03c6 \u2212 m2(A) \u03c62 ,\n2\n\n(11)\n\nis the stress-energy tensor of the pseudoscalar (axion) field \u03c6.\n\n2.2\n2.2.1\n\nNon-minimal extension of the model\nLagrangian and non-minimal susceptibilities\n\nWe consider the total action functional as a sum of minimal and non-minimal contributions:\nS = S(M) + S(NM) ,\n4\n\n(12)\n\n\fwhere S(M) is given by (1). The non-minimal contribution S(NM) is, generally, a nonlinear\nfunction of all independent invariants containing Riemann tensor Riklm and the dual ones\n\u2217\n\u2217\nRiklm , Riklm\n, Ricci tensor Rmn and Ricci scalar R in convolutions with the Maxwell tensor\nand its dual, as well as with derivatives of pseudoscalar field. The set of such invariants for\npure electromagnetic field was discussed in [47]; then it was supplemented by the invariants\ncontaining scalar Higgs fields in [53, 54, 56]. For the axion field, this set of invariants can be\nconstructed analogously, and here we focus only on the following Lagrangian linear in the\ncurvature:\nS(NM) =\n\nZ\n\n\u001b\n\u221a \u001a 1 ikmn\n1\n\u2217\nmn\n2\n.\nd4 x \u2212g\nR\nFik Fmn + \u03c7ikmn\n\u03c6\nF\nF\n\u2212R\n\u2207\n\u03c6\u2207\n\u03c6+\u03b7\nR\u03c6\nik mn\nn\n(A)\n(A) m\n2\n2 (A)\n\n(13)\n\nThe quantity Rikmn is a non-minimal three-parameter susceptibility tensor [47], which has\na form\nRikmn = q1 Rg ikmn + q2 Rikmn + q3 Rikmn ,\n(14)\nwhere\n\n1\ng ikmn \u2261 (g im g kn \u2212g in g km) ,\n(15)\n2\n1\n(16)\nRikmn \u2261 (Rim g kn \u2212Rin g km +Rkn g im \u2212Rkm g in ) .\n2\nThe constants q1 , q2 and q3 are non-minimal parameters describing the linear coupling of\nthe Maxwell tensor Fmn with curvature [47]. The quantity \u03c7ikmn\n(A) given by\nikmn\n\u03c7ikmn\n+Q2 Rikmn +Q3 Rikmn ,\n(A) =Q1 Rg\n\n(17)\n\nwhere Q1 , Q2 and Q3 are also constants, is the non-minimal susceptibility tensor describing\n\u2217\nthe linear coupling of the dual tensor Fmn\nwith curvature. As in the previous case, the\n\u2217\ncombination \u03c6Fmn gives the tensor quantity. The tensor\n\u0011\n1 \u0010 ml n\nnl m\nmn\nRmn\n\u2261\n\u03b7\nF\nR\n+\nF\nR\n+ \u03b73 Rmn\n1\n(A)\nl\nl + \u03b72 Rg\n2\n\n(18)\n\ndescribes a non-minimal susceptibility for the pseudoscalar field in analogy with [53], but in\nthis case it contains a term linear in the Maxwell tensor. This term describes effects analogous\nto the so-called derivative coupling in the non-minimal scalar field theory [31, 32, 33]. As for\nthe tenth coupling constant \u03b7(A) , it is a direct analog of the well-known coupling constant \u03be\nin the non-minimal scalar field theory (see, e.g., [30] for review and references).\nThe tensors Rikmn and \u03c7ikmn\n(A) , defined by (14) and (17), are skew-symmetric with respect\nto transposition of the indices i and k, as well as m and n. In addition, the following relations\ntake place\nmnik\nRikmn = Rmnik , \u03c7ikmn\n(19)\n(A) = \u03c7(A) ,\nwhich guarantee that the model under consideration does not contain the solutions of the\nmn\nnm\nskewon type [27].

In terms of the quantity \u03c7\u0302ikmn the condition for no birefringence (no splitting, no\nretardation) for electromagnetic wave propagation in all directions in the weak field limit\ngives ten constraint equations on the components of constitutive tensor density (see, e.g.,\n[60]-[63]). With these ten constraints \u03c7\u0302ikmn can be rewritten in the following form\n\u03c7\u0302ikmn =\n\ni\nh\n1\u221a\n\u2212H \u03c8 H im H kn \u2212 H in H km + \u03c6E ikmn ,\n2\n\n(42)\n\nwhere H = det(Hik ) is a determinant of an effective metric Hik , which generates the light\ncone for electromagnetic wave propagation; \u03c8 is some dilation factor; \u03c6 differs from our \u03c6\nby the coefficient two \u03c6 = 2\u03c6. In case when (42) is not satisfied, birefringence will occur. In\ncase when (42) is satisfied, a pseudoscalar field \u03c6 will give a polarization rotation (an optical\nactivity induced by \u03c6). The effects of birefringence and polarization rotation described in\nterms of constitutive tensor density are studied in the 1970's and 1980's. In particular,\nconstraints on birefringence from pulsar signal observations give the following estimates for\nthe birefringence part \u03b4 \u03c7\u0302ikmn of \u03c7\u0302ikmn in a weak field:\n\u03b4 \u03c7\u0302ikmn < 10\u221214 \u2212 10\u221216 .\n8\n\n(43)\n\n\fUsing the medium velocity four-vector U i , normalized by U i Ui = 1, one can decompose\nC ikmn uniquely as\nh\n\nC ikmn =\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03b5im U k U n \u2212 \u03b5in U k U m + \u03b5kn U i U m \u2212 \u03b5km U i U n +\n\ni\n\n+ 12 \u2212\u03b7 ikl (\u03bc\u22121 )ls \u03b7 mns + \u03b7 ikl (U m \u03bdl n \u2212 U n \u03bdl m ) + \u03b7 lmn (U i \u03bdl k \u2212 U k \u03bdl i ) .\n\n(44)\n\nHere \u03b5im is the dielectric permittivity tensor, (\u03bc\u22121 )pq is the magnetic impermeability tensor,\nand \u03bdp m* is the tensor of magneto-electric coefficients.

The first part does not contain pseudoscalar field \u03c6, is linear in the parameters q2 and\nq3 and describes optical activity induced by direct non-minimal interaction between electromagnetic and gravitational fields (such a model was analyzed in [65, 54]). It is important to\nmention that this part of the cross-tensor \u03bd pm contains both: skew-symmetric and symmetric\nterms (see the terms with \u03b7pmk and \u2217 Rplmn Ul Un ). The second contribution to \u03bd pm , which is\npm\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0015\n\n9\n\n\fproportional to the pseudoscalar field \u03c6, is symmetric with respect to transposition of indices\n(see the terms, containing the projector \u2206pm and the tensor \u2217 R\u2217plmn \u2212Rplmn ). It describes\nan optical activity induced by the axion field, the term \u2206pm \u03c6 relates to the minimal effects,\nthe terms proportional to Q1 , Q2 and Q3 relates to non-minimal effects. It is well-known\nthat the non-vanishing cross-tensor \u03bd ik indicates that the medium is optically active, and the\nrotation of the Faraday type takes place in the course of electromagnetic wave propagation.\nThus, one can see directly from (50), that the non-minimal interaction between electromagnetic and axion fields produces curvature-induced optical activity of a new type.

Ten non-minimal (NM) coupling parameters are divided into four subgroups: the first\nq1 , q2 , q3 ; second Q1 , Q2 , Q3 ; third \u03b71 , \u03b72 , \u03b73 ; and fourth \u03b7(A) . In the second column the terms in the\nLagrangian are given in front of which the corresponding coupling parameters are introduced; the\nparameters of the first subgroup introduce the terms without the pseudoscalar field \u03c6; the parameters of the second subgroup relate to the terms linear in \u03c6; the terms indicated by \u03b71 , \u03b72 , \u03b73 , are\nquadratic in the four-gradient of \u03c6; and finally, \u03b7(A) introduces the term quadratic in \u03c6. In the last\ncolumn, we point out the physical meaning of these non-minimal terms, based on decompositions\nof the constitutive tensors for the electromagnetic (EM) and pseudoscalar fields.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nNon-minimal models with pp-wave symmetry\nReduced non-minimal field equations\n\nWe consider the line element for the spacetime with pp-wave symmetry in the form [66]\nn\n\ni\n\nh\n\no\n\nds2 = 2dudv \u2212 L2 cosh 2\u03b3 e2\u03b2 (dx2 )2 + e\u22122\u03b2 (dx3 )2 + 2 sinh 2\u03b3dx2 dx3 ,\n1\n\n1\n\n(51)\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwhere u= ct\u2212x\nand v= ct+x\nare the retarded and the advanced times, respectively; \u03b2(u) and\n2\n2\n\u03b3(u) are functions of retarded time only, they determine the polarization of gravitational\nwave field. The case when the gravitational pp-wave field is characterized by one polarization\n\n10\n\n\fonly (\u03b3 = 0) is investigated in detail in [64]. Various properties of pp-waves are discussed,\ne.g., in [67, 68, 69]. For the metric (51), the Riemann tensor has only three non-vanishing\ncomponents R2u2u , R3u3u and R2u3u . The Ricci tensor has only one (generally) non-vanishing\ncomponent Ruu and the Ricci scalar is equal to zero identically R = 0. For this metric the\nthree Killing vectors, which form an Abelian subgroup of the group G5 [69], are\ni\n\u03be(v)\n= \u03b4vi ,\n\ni\n\u03be(2)\n= \u03b42i ,\n\ni\n\u03be(3)\n= \u03b43i .\n\n(52)\n\ni\ni\ni\nThe Killing vector \u03be(v)\nis a covariant constant null vector orthogonal to \u03be(2)\nand \u03be(3)\n. We suggest here that the axion and electromagnetic field potentials inherit the spacetime symmetry,\ni.e. the Lie derivatives satisfy the following relations:\n\n\u00a3\u03be(a) \u03c6 = 0 ,\n\n\u00a3\u03be(a) Am = 0 ,\n\n(53)\n\nwhere (a) take the values (v), (2) and (3). As a consequence of (53), the pseudoscalar field and\nelectromagnetic field potential depend on the retarded time only, \u03c6 = \u03c6(u), Am = Am (u).\nTaking into account the Lorentz gauge \u2207k Ak = 0, we can choose the potential in the form\nAu = Av = 0 ,\n\nA2 = A2 (u) ,\n\nA3 = A3 (u) .\n\n(54)\n\nThe next step is to verify that pp-wave symmetry is admitted by the total system of nonminimal master equations. Direct calculations show that for such an ansatz about symmetry\nthe non-minimal equation for pseudoscalar field \u03c6(u), i.e. the equations (23) with (18), are\nsatisfied identically for arbitrary Q1 ,...\u03b73 and \u03b7(A) , when the axion field is massless, i.e.\nm(A) = 0. Also, the non-minimal electrodynamic equations (20) with (21) and (22) are\nsatisfied identically for arbitrary coupling constants, when the potential takes the form (54).\nFinally, the non-minimal equations for the gravitational field (24) with (25)-(37) can be\nreduced to one equation only, namely\n\"\n\n#\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\ni\nh\n2 L\u2032\u2032\n2\n2\n2\n\u2212\n+ (\u03b2 \u2032 ) cosh2 2\u03b3+ (\u03b3 \u2032 ) 1+\u03ba\u03b7(A) \u03c62 = (\u03c6\u2032 ) 1+2\u03b7(A) +2\u03b7(A) \u03c6\u03c6\u2032\u2032 +\n\u03ba L\n\u0011\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0010\n1\n\u2032 \u2212\u03b2 2\n\u2032 \u03b2 2\n(55)\n\u22122 sinh 2\u03b3 A\u20322 A\u20323 .\ncosh\n2\u03b3\nA\ne\n+\nA\ne\n2\n3\nL2\nThe prime denotes here and below the derivative with respect to the retarded time u. The\nright-hand side of this equation includes, as usual, the minimal contributions from the tensors\n(A)\n(EM)\n(7)\nTik and Tik . Only two non-minimal contributions came from the term Tik (37) and from\nthe term \u03ba\u03b7(A) \u03c62 in the expression for \u0398 (25). The non-minimal coupling constants q1 , q2 ,\nq3 , Q1 Q2 , Q3 , \u03b71 , \u03b72 , \u03b73 are non-vanishing, but they happen to be hidden in this pp-wave\nmodel. Thus, in the presented model, six functions \u03c6(u), A2 (u), A3 (u), \u03b2(u), \u03b3(u) and\nL(u) are linked by one equation (55) only, and this model admits very wide possibilities in\nsearching for exact solutions.\n\n+\n\n\u001a\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0014\n\n11\n\n\u001b\n\n\f3.2\n\nExact solutions of the pp-wave type:\nquasi-minimal models with \u03b7(A) = 0\n\nWhen the non-minimal parameter \u03b7(A) is vanishing, we deal with a model which looks like\nminimal, i.e. the key equation for the pp-wave gravitational field\n\u2212\n\n\u03ba\nL\u2032\u2032\n2\n2\n2\n= (\u03b2 \u2032 ) cosh2 2\u03b3+ (\u03b3 \u2032 ) + (\u03c6\u2032 ) +\nL\n2\n\n\u00112 \u0010\n\u0010\n\u00112\n\u03ba\n+ 2 cosh 2\u03b3 A\u20322 e\u2212\u03b2 + A\u20323 e\u03b2\n\u22122 sinh 2\u03b3 A\u20322 A\u20323\n(56)\n2L\ndoes not contain non-minimal parameters at all.

Clearly, the quantity \u2212 LL in the left-hand side of (56) has to be non-negative.\nThis property of L(u), which has initial value L(0) = 1, provides L(u) to vanish at some\nmoment u = u\u2217 (L(u\u2217 ) = 0)(see, e.g., [68]). This moment of the retarded time relates to\nthe well-known singularity, the physical sense of which is discussed in detail in many books.\nIn [69], a number of papers are quoted, in which exact solutions of (56) are obtained for\nthe pure electromagnetic source (\u03c6 = 0). In addition, exact solutions of the model of this\ntype are known for vanishing Ak , when the (pure)scalar field \u03a6 is the source of the pp-wave\ngravity field (see, e.g., [70]). Finally, when Ak = 0 and \u03c6 = 0, we deal with the so-called\npure gravitational pp-wave (see, e.g., [64, 67, 68, 69]). We would like to list here only three\nexamples from the wide collection of minimal solutions of the equation (56), which relates\nto the models with symmetric spacetime of the pp-wave type.

The wave four-vectors Ki = \u2207i W(2) and Ki = \u2207i W(3) can be represented as\nfollows:\n(2)\n(3)\nKi = Ki \u2212 \u03b4iu q3 kv R2u2u , Ki = Ki \u2212 \u03b4iu q3 kv R3u3u ,\n(112)\nkv =\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Ki is given by (101).

Let the test electromagnetic wave propagate\nin the direction \u2212x1 , and the solution for the gravitational field be of the Petrov type, i.e.\nR2u2u = \u2212R3u3u = \u03bd 2 . Then one obtains the explicit expressions for the phase velocities:\n(2)\n\nvph\n\u03c9(2)\n=\n= 1 \u2212 q3 \u03bd 2 ,\nc\nkc\n\n(3)\n\nvph\n\u03c9(3)\n=\n= 1 + q3 \u03bd 2 ,\nc\nkc\n\nkv\nk\u2261\u221a ,\n2\n\n(116)\n\nand for the refraction indices:\n1 + q3 \u03bd 2\n,\n1 \u2212 q3 \u03bd 2\n\nn(2) =\n\nn(3) =\n\n1 \u2212 q3 \u03bd 2\n,\n1 + q3 \u03bd 2\n\n\u2206n =\n\n4q3 \u03bd 2\n.\n1 \u2212 q32 \u03bd 4\n\n(117)\n\nThis means, first, that the phase velocities differ from each other, one of them being less than\nthe speed of light in vacuum c, while the second being bigger than c. Second, the non-minimal\n(curvature induced) difference between the refraction indices for the waves with orthogonal\npolarizations depends on the curvature \u03bd 2 and the non-minimal coupling parameter q3 . Thus,\nin this illustration, we deal with birefringence in the absence of polarization rotation.\nThe constraints on the non-minimal coupling parameter from solar system observations\nand from pulsar data analysis were studied in [76] (the parameter \u03bb in this paper relates\nto q3 /4 in our case). From the timing observations of the binary pulsar PSR B1534+12\nsignals, Prasanna and Mohanty gave a constraint on q3 to be |q3 | < 2.4 * 1011 cm2 . From\nmore precise observations of the double pulsar system PSR J0737-3039 A/B, the Shapiro\ntime delay (passing PSR J0737-3039 B of mass 1.25 MSun and radius 10 km) is measured to\nbe 6.21 \u00b1 0.33 \u03bcs [77]. The theoretical estimate using general relativity is 6.153 \u00b1 0.26 \u03bcs. If\nwe take an upper limit of 0.1 \u03bcs for the maximum contribution of the polarization-dependent\ncorrection, we have an upper bound |q3 | < 2.4 * 1010 cm2 .\n\n4.3\n\nQuasi-minimal model of optical activity (q3 = 0, Q3 = 0)\ninduced by varying pseudoscalar field (\u03c6 6= \u03c60 )\n\nNow we consider the model in which the birefringence is absent, but the rotation of polarization is present. Let two non-minimal coefficients q3 and Q3 be vanishing; then the exact\nsolutions of (96), (97), (102), (103) are\n\u03b2(u)\n\nA2 = e\n\n1\n1\nE(W ) cos [\u03c6(u)\u2212\u03c6(0)] + F (W ) sin [\u03c6(u)\u2212\u03c6(0)] ,\n2\n2\n\n\u001a\n\n\u001b\n\n20\n\n(118)\n\n\f1\n1\nE(W ) sin [\u03c6(u)\u2212\u03c6(0)] \u2212 F (W ) cos [\u03c6(u)\u2212\u03c6(0)] ,\nA3 = e\n2\n2\nh\ni\n1\n\u22122\u03b2(u)\n2\u03b2(u)\nk\ne\nA\n+\nk\ne\nA\n.\nAv = 0 , Au =\n2\n2\n3\n3\nkv L2\n\u2212\u03b2(u)\n\n\u001a\n\n\u001b\n\n(119)\n(120)\n\nHere E(W ) and F (W ) are arbitrary functions of one phase scalar W (100); thus, there is no\nbirefringence. But now we deal with the effect of Faraday rotation, induced by the photonaxion interactions. This is a kind of optical activity induced by the axion field. The effect of\nthe Faraday rotation is described by the rotation phase \u03c6(u)\u2212\u03c6(0), so this effect disappears\nwhen the pseudoscalar field is constant. When the pseudoscalar field is a linear function\nof retarded time (see (66), (67)), the Faraday rotation is uniform. Let us mention again\nthat we indicate this model as quasi-minimal since we suppose that only two non-minimal\nparameter are vanishing, but other ones are non-vanishing.\n\n4.4\n\nNon-minimal optical activity induced by photon-axion\ninteraction in the case of a constant pseudoscalar field \u03c6 = \u03c60\n\nWhen non-minimal coupling constants are non-vanishing, i.e. q3 6= 0 and Q3 6= 0, we search\nfor exact solutions to the system (105), (106) as follows:\nB2 = h1 (u) cos W + h2 (u) sin W ,\n\nB3 = \u2212h3 (u) sin W + h4 (u) cos W .\n\n(121)\n\nAgain W is given by (100), and four functions of the retarded time h1 , h2 , h3 and h4 satisfy\nthe following system of linear ordinary first-order differential equations with a coefficient\ndepending on retarded time u:\n1\nh\u20321 (u) = \u2212 \u03c6\u2032 h4 \u2212 q3 kv R2u2u h2 + Q3 \u03c6 kv R2u2u h3 ,\n2\n1\nh\u20322 (u) = + \u03c6\u2032 h3 + q3 kv R2u2u h1 + Q3 \u03c6 kv R2u2u h4 ,\n2\n1\nh\u20323 (u) = \u2212 \u03c6\u2032 h2 \u2212 q3 kv R3u3u h4 + Q3 \u03c6 kv R3u3u h1 ,\n2\n1\n(122)\nh\u20324 (u) = + \u03c6\u2032 h1 + q3 kv R3u3u h3 + Q3 \u03c6 kv R3u3u h2 .\n2\nLet the function \u03c6(u) be presented by a constant value \u03c6(u) = \u03c60 .

Thus, the quantity \u03a9 plays\na role of frequency of the curvature-induced rotation of the Faraday type. Let us stress\nthat in this model the non-minimal coupling parameters Q3 and q3 play equivalent roles,\npredetermining the pure rotation of the polarization vector without damping. When the ppwave spacetime is symmetric, i.e. the component R2u2u is constant, one obtains immediately\nfrom (123) that \u03c4 is linear in the retarded time, e.g. for solution (64) one obtains \u03c4 = \u03bd 2 kv u.\nh2 (\u03c4 ) = h2 (0) cos \u03a9\u03c4 +\n\n4.4.1\n\nConstraints on the non-minimal coupling parameters from CMB polarization observations\n\nThe parameter Q3 enters the key formulas in the product Q3 \u03c60 and thus relates to the nonminimal axion contribution to the effect of polarization rotation. Let us assume that q3 = 0\nand the following simple initial conditions take place\nh1 (0) = h3 (0) = h4 (0) = 0 ,\n\nh2 (0) = B0 \u2192 B2 = B0 sin W ,\n\nB3 = 0 ,\n\n(129)\n\ni.e. initially the electromagnetic wave was polarized along the 0x2 axis only.

The QUaD\nobservations [80] on CMB polarization give the most stringent constraint on \u2206\u03c6 [81]\n\nFor gravitational waves with a wavelength of the order of the Hubble distance, this is the\nconstraint, \u2206\u03c6HD ; for shorter wavelength, \u03bb, we have to use the estimate\n\u2206\u03c6\u03bb \u2243 \u2206\u03c6HD\n\n(\n\n\u03bb\nHubble Distance\n\n)\n\n.\n\n(138)\n\nIn the general case, \u2206\u03c6 depends on directions [22].

We formulated a new non-minimal ten-parameter Einstein-Maxwell-axion model, i.e. on\nthe basis of the Lagrangian approach, we derived a non-minimally extended self-consistent\n(coupled) system of equations for electromagnetic (see equations (20),(21),(22)), pseudoscalar\n(see equation (23)) and gravitational (see (24)-(37)) fields. The Lagrangian is linear in the\ncurvature tensor and its contractions, and is quadratic in the Maxwell tensor, i.e. we deal\nwith one of the versions of non-minimal linear axion electrodynamics.\n2. The constitutive tensor (see (40) with (14)-(18)), associated with this model, is manifestly\nsymmetric with respect to transposition of pairs of indices, i.e. this model excludes skewons\n[27] and describes non-minimal interaction of photons and axions only. An extension of the\nmodel accounting for skewon-type interactions will be considered separately.\n3. Decomposition of the constitutive tensor demonstrates explicitly that the dielectric\npermittivity, magnetic impermeability tensors and the tensor of cross-effects (or tensor of\nmagneto-electric coefficients, in other words) acquire non-minimal contributions, including\nterms proportional to the pseudoscalar (axion) field. Since the tensor of non-minimal crosseffects is non-vanishing, one may conclude that, generally, the curvature-induced effect of\noptical activity is expected, even if the pseudoscalar (axion) field is constant.\n4. We applied the non-minimal Einstein-Maxwell-axion model to the case when the spacetime has the pp-wave symmetry and all the physical fields inherit this symmetry. The\nreduced system of equations contains in this case only one key-equation (55). We presented\nnine examples of exact solutions for the non-minimally coupled electromagnetic, axion and\ngravitational fields with pp-wave symmetry. One can emphasize three new solutions among\nthem. First, there is a new regular solution (see section 3.3.1.), which can appear in the\nnon-minimal model only; the term regularity means that gravitational, electromagnetic and\npseudoscalar fields have no singularities and are described by the functions finite everywhere.\nSecond, there exist exact solutions describing circularly polarized electromagnetic waves coupled non-minimally to the axion field and plane gravitational waves (see (80)-(82)). Third,\nthe solution which is known as Cheshire smile is also admissible in this model (see section\n3.3.4).\n5. Discussing the optical activity induced by photon-axion interaction, we solved exactly the\nproblem of propagation of test electromagnetic waves coupled non-minimally to the pseudoscalar and gravitational fields in the pp-wave background. According to the classification\nof the models of photon-axion interaction given in the paper [72], we deal here with the case\nwhen the four-gradient of the pseudoscalar field is a null four-vector, i.e. \u2207k \u03c6\u2207k \u03c6 = 0. We\nshow explicitly that the non-minimal coupling of the photon and axions with gravitational\nfield generally leads to the birefringence effect. We discussed explicit exact solutions which\ndescribe the effect of optical activity.\n6. Non-minimal Einstein-Maxwell-axion model can give the cosmological solutions of the\nFLRW and Bianchi-I type, as well as static spherically symmetric solutions of the ReissnerNordstr\u00f6m type. We intend to consider the corresponding exact solutions in the near future.\n\n24\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nWe thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 10875171) and\nRussian Foundation for Basic Research (Grants No. 08-02-00325-a and 09-05-99015) for\nsupport.
