In\nextensions of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) [2] which can\naccomodate neutrino masses we therefore expect to have right-handed sneutrinos. In\nthe cosmology of the MSSM and its extensions, Bose condensates of scalar fields such\nas squarks and sleptons form naturally after inflation [4]. These may have important\nconsequences for cosmology; for example, they allow for the possibility of baryogenesis\nand leptogenesis via the Affleck-Dine mechanism [4, 5]. Since right-handed sneutrinos\nmay also form condensates, it is important to consider in some detail the cosmological\nevolution of a r.h. sneutrino condensate.\nDue to the weak coupling of the r.h. sneutrinos to the MSSM fields, a condensate\nof r.h. sneutrinos will be long-lived and so may come to dominate the energy density of\nthe Universe before it decays. The question of whether the r.h. sneutrino condensate\ncan dominate the energy density of the Universe when it decays has recently acquired\nsome importance. It has been noted [6, 7] that if a scalar dominates the energy\ndensity when it decays, and if that scalar is effectively massless during inflation, then\nquantum fluctuations of the scalar during inflation can in principle account for the\nprimordial energy density perturbations leading to structure formation [6, 7, 8]. This\nhas been labelled the curvaton scenario [9, 10]. Should the curvaton be able to account\nfor the density perturbations, the parameters of the inflation model would be more\nweakly constrained than in the conventional case where density perturbations arise\nfrom quantum fluctuations of the inflaton.\nThus if there exists a natural curvaton candidate such as the r.h. sneutrino, it is\nimportant to confirm or exclude that candidate as a curvaton1 . The main goal of this\npaper is to investigate the possibility of a r.h. sneutrino curvaton.\nThe masses of the r.h. sneutrinos and their coupling to the MSSM fields are\ndetermined by the model of neutrino masses, in particular whether they have Dirac\n1\n\nModels have recently been proposed where the curvaton corresponds to an MSSM flat direction\n\nscalar [11] and an MSSM Higgs scalar [12].\n\n1\n\n\fmasses or Majorana masses via a see-saw mechanism [1]. The Yukawa coupling of\nthe r.h. sneutrino to the MSSM fields plays a fundamental role in determining the\nevolution of the r.h. sneutrino condensate, in particular its decay temperature, its\neffective mass from interacting with the background of inflaton decay products [13]\nand its rate of thermalisation/scattering from the background.\nThroughout this paper we will consider the simplest model for inflation and reheating, coresponding to a constant expansion rate during inflation followed by formation\nof a coherently oscillating inflaton condensate and reheating due to perturbative inflaton decays.\nThe paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we discuss the cosmological enviroment due to perturbative inflaton decays. In Section 3 we consider the evolution of the\nr.h. sneutrino condensate in this enviroment. In Section 4 we present our conclusions.\n\n2\n\nCosmological Background from Perturbative Inflaton Decays\n\nAfter inflation we consider the inflaton S to have a mass mS and to be coherently\noscillating about the minimum of its potential. The inflaton is assumed to decay into\npairs of relativistic MSSM particles with initial energy mS /2. If the initial energy of\nthe decay products is sufficiently large, the initial scattering rate of the inflaton decay\nproducts may be small enough that thermalisation only occurs once the Universe has\nexpanded sufficiently for the decay product scattering rate \u0393sc to exceed the expansion\nrate H. There are therefore two possibilities:\n(a) Instantaneous Thermalisation. The inflaton decay products thermalise immediately after decay. In this case there will be two epochs: (i) Inflaton Matter Domination (IMD), where the energy density of the Universe is dominated by the coherently\noscillating inflaton, and (ii) Radiation Domination (RD), defined to mean domination of the energy density of the Universe by relativistic inflaton decay products, not\nnecessarily thermalised.\n\n2\n\n\f(b) Non-instantaneous Thermalisation. The relativistic inflaton decay products are unthermalised initially. In this case we will show that thermalisation cannot\noccur during IMD and so must occur during RD. Therefore in this case the background will have three distinct epochs: (i) IMD, (ii) RD pre-thermalisation and (iii)\nRD post-thermalisation.\n\n2.1\n\nInflaton decay product thermalisation\n\nPrior to thermalisation there is a spectrum of decay products, ranging from red-shifted\nproducts from the earliest decays (occuring at the end of inflation) to products from\nthe most recent decays. Most of the energy density in decay products will come from\nthe most recent decays. Following the discussion of [14], the spectrum of unthermalised\ndecay products as a function of energy during IMD and RD epochs is given by\ndn\n3 H\n\u2248\ndE\n2 HR\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\u03b3\n\n\u03c1S (HR ) E 1/2\n,\nmS m3/2\nS\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b3 = 1 during IMD (3/4 during RD), n(E) is the number density of decay\nproducts with energy less than E and HR is the expansion rate at the onset of radiation\ndomination. Thus n(E) \u221d E 3/2 and so 80% of the decay products at a given time have\nenergy between Ed and Ed /3, where Ed is the energy of the most recent decay products.\nIn addition, once thermalisation by scattering begins, the lower energy decay products\ntend first to increase their energy by scattering from the more numerous higher-energy\ndecay products in the spectrum [15, 16], so that they may be regarded as higherenergy decay products as far as thermalisation is concerned. Thus we will consider\nthe energy of the decay products at a given time to be approximately Ed . During\nIMD, Ed \u2248 mS /2. Once the inflaton condensate has decayed away and the Universe\nenters the RD epoch, the energy of the dominant unthermalised decay products will\nbe red-shifted to Ed \u2248\ndomination.\n\n\u0010\n\naR\na\n\n\u0011\n\nmS\n,\n2\n\nwhere aR is the scale factor at the onset of radiation\n\nThe centre of mass (CM) cross-section of the relativistic inflaton decay products is\n\u03c3sc \u2248\n\n2\n\u03b1sc\n,\n2\nECM\n\n3\n\n(2)\n\n\fwhere ECM \u2248 2Ed and \u03b1sc = g 2 /4\u03c0, where g is a typical MSSM gauge or Yukawa\ncoupling. Therefore the scattering rate of the inflaton decay products is \u0393sc = n\u03c3sc ,\nwhere n is the number density of inflaton decay products.\nDuring IMD most of the decay products at a given scale factor are produced during\nthe previous e-folding. The energy density in the inflaton condensate during IMD is\nae\n\u03c1S =\na\n\u0012\n\n\u00133\n\ne\u2212\u0393d t \u03c1I ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u0393d is the decay rate of the inflaton, ae is the scale factor at the end of inflation\nand \u03c1I is the energy density during inflation, assumed constant. Therefore the number\nof inflatons which decay during an e-folding (\u03b4t \u2248 H \u22121 ) (and so the number of inflaton\ndecay products produced) is\nn\u2248\n\n\u0393d \u03c1S\nH mS\n\n(4)\n\nfor \u0393d /H < 1. The condition for thermalisation to occur during IMD, \u0393sc\n2\n3\u03b1sc\nM 2 \u0393d\nm3S\n\n>\n\u223c\n\n1,\n\n>\n\u223c\n\nH, is then\n(5)\n\n\u221a\nwhere M = MP l / 8\u03c0 and we have used Ed = mS /2 and \u03c1S \u2248 3M 2 H 2 during IMD.\nEq. (5) is independent of the scale factor, so if it is not satisfied immediately at the end\nof inflation, it will not be satisfied during IMD. Therefore for the case of perturbative\ninflaton decay, thermalisation must either be instantaneous or must occur during RD.\nAfter IMD, the number density and energy of the relativistic decay products is\naR\nn=\na\n\u0012\n\n\u00133\n\naR\nn(aR ) ; Ed \u2248\na\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nmS\n.\n2\n\n(6)\n\nThe inflaton decay rate, \u0393d , may be expressed in terms of the reheating temperature2 ,\nTR , as \u0393d = kTR TR2 /MP l , where kTR = (4\u03c0 3 g(TR )/45)1/2 and g(TR ) is the effective\nnumber of massless degrees of freedom in thermal equilibrium [20].

In addition, we\nexpect terms due to Planck-scale suppressed interactions. For now we will consider\nthe evolution of the sneutrino condensate in the absence of such terms.\nIf MN = 0 we will have Dirac neutrino masses, with m\u03bd = \u03bb\u03bd vu . The r.h. sneutrino\nmass is then given by m2\u00d1 = m2o + m2ef f .

However, other natural mass scales could also\nbe of interest, for example MN \u223c 100 GeV \u2212 1 TeV, as suggested by the electroweak\nscale and by the scale of the SUSY mass term \u03bcHu Hd of the MSSM superpotential [2].\n\n3.2\n\nConditions for r.h. sneutrino to act as a curvaton\n\nR.h. sneutrino oscillations begin once the r.h. sneutrino mass satisfies m\u00d1\n\n>\n\u223c\n\nH. We\n\ndenote the scale factor at this time by aosc and the homogeneous sneutrino expectation\nvalue by Nosc . During inflation, in order to serve as a curvaton, the r.h. sneutrino must\nbe effectively massless, m\u00d1 \u226a HI . The quantum fluctuation of an effectively massless\nr.h. sneutrino mode at horizon crossing is given by \u03b4N \u2248 HI /2\u03c0 [20]. In the case\n\nof a scalar potential consisting purely of a mass term (\u221d N 2 ), once the perturbation\n\nmode is stretched outside the horizon by the expansion of the Universe, its amplitude\non sub-horizon scales will evolve in the same way as the homogeneous field. This can\nbe seen by considering N = No + \u03b4N, where No is the homogeneous field and \u03b4N is a\nperturbation of wavenumber k. The equations of motion for these are\n\u2032\n\nN\u0308o + 3H \u1e44o = \u2212V (No )\n\n(15)\n\nand\n\u03b4 N\u0308 + 3H\u03b4 \u1e44 \u2212\n\nk2\n\u2032\u2032\n\u03b4N = \u2212V (No )\u03b4N .\n2\na\n\n(16)\n\nFor a mode outside the horizon, the k2 /a2 term (\u226a H 2 ) will effectively play no role\nin the evolution of the scalar field. Therefore, for V (N) \u221d N 2 , Eq. (15) \u2194 Eq. (16)\nunder No \u2194 \u03b4N. Thus No and \u03b4N will evolve in the same way. Therefore \u03b4N/N\nfor a superhorizon perturbation will be fixed by its value at the onset of oscillations,\n7\n\n\f(\u03b4N/N)osc . Once coherent oscillations of the r.h. sneutrino begin, the energy density in\nthe r.h. sneutrino field will be proportional to its amplitude squared. Therefore if the\nenergy density of the Universe becomes dominated by the r.h. sneutrino oscillations\nbefore the sneutrinos decay, the energy density perturbation when a given mode reenters the horizon will be given by\n\u03b4\u03c1\n\u03b4\u03c1 \u2261\n\u2248\n\u03c1\n\n2\u03b4N\nN\n\n!\n\n=\nosc\n\nHI\n.\n\u03c0NI\n\n(17)\n\n(A more precise calculation gives the same result up to a factor of the order of 1 [9].)\nFor HI and NI constant this corresponds to a scale-invariant perturbation spectrum.\nIn order to account for the observed CMB temperature fluctuations, we then require\nthat \u03b4\u03c1 \u2248 10\u22125 [22].\n\n3.3\n\nCondensate evolution without Planck-suppressed terms\n\nThe evolution of the r.h. sneutrino expectation value depends on the inflaton decay\nproduct background and reheating temperature.

It also shows that TR cannot be very small compared with the thermal\n10\n\n\fgravitino upper bound of 108 GeV if Nosc\n\n<\n\u223c\n\nM. The requirement that Nosc is not very\n\nsmall compared with M is a strong constraint on a Majorana r.h. sneutrino curvaton,\nsince, as we discuss below, it requires a high degree of suppression of Planck-scale\nsuppressed contributions to the r.h. sneutrino superpotential.\nFrom Eq.

This can be substantially lower than the\ntypical value of the expansion rate during inflation found in conventional SUSY inflation models, HI \u2248 1013 GeV [25, 26, 27]. For the case of Majorana neutrino masses\nwith NI \u2248 Nosc\n\n>\n\u223c\n\n0.01M, the corresponding bound on HI is HI\n\n>\n\u223c\n\n7 \u00d7 1011 GeV.\n\nThese bounds assume that N does not evolve significantly from the end of inflation to\nthe onset of sneutrino oscillations, so that Nosc \u2248 NI . We will see that the range of\nallowed HI can be increased if this assumption is altered.\n\n3.4\n\nEffect of Planck-suppressed terms\n\nIn general, in addition to the globally SUSY scalar potential we expect (in the absence\nof specific symmetries) terms suppressed by powers of the reduced Planck mass, M =\n\u221a\nMP l / 8\u03c0, corresponding to the natural scale of supergravity (SUGRA) corrections\n[3, 19]. Thus we expect Planck-scale suppressed non-renormalisable terms to appear\nin the r.h. neutrino superpotential. We also expect contributions to the mass squared\nterm of the form cH 2 , where |c| is model-dependent but expected to be of the order\nof 1 in the simplest models. These arise from terms in the full Lagrangian of the form\n1\nM2\n\nR\n\nd4 \u03b8S \u2020 SN \u2020 N = |FS |2 /M 2 , where S is the inflaton field (or any other field with a\n\nnon-zero F-term contributing to the energy density of the Universe).\n(i) cH 2 corrections\nDuring inflation the value of |c| is constrained by the deviation of the curvaton\nperturbation from scale-invariance. We consider the r.h. sneutrino potential during\ninflation to be\n1\nV (N) \u2248 cH 2 N 2 .\n2\n\n11\n\n(31)\n\n\fThe expansion rate during inflation is then\nHI2\n\n1\ncHI2 N 2\n=\n\u03c1S +\n3M 2\n2\n\n!\n\n(32)\n\nwhere \u03c1S is the energy density of the inflaton field, which we assume to be constant.\nThe index n of the perturbation spectrum as a function of present wavenumber k\nis given by\nn=1+\nsuch that \u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1 \u221d k\n\nn\u22121\n2\n\n2k d\u03b4\u03c1\n,\n\u03b4\u03c1 dk\n\n(33)\n\nand n = 1 corresponds to scale-invariance. \u03b4\u03c1 will remain\n\nconstant once the perturbation is outside the horizon, since both N and \u03b4N evolve in\nthe same way for V (N) \u221d N 2 .

This is\nsignificantly larger than the value |c| \u223c 1 expected on dimensional grounds in SUGRA\nmodels [18]. This problem is similar to the conventional '\u03b7-problem' encountered in\nSUSY inflation models [25, 26, 27], where order H 2 corrections lead both to a large\ndeviation from scale-invariance and to insufficient slow-roll inflation [18]. It has a\nnatural solution in the case of SUSY D-term hybrid inflation (driven by the energy\ndensity of a Fayet-Illiopoulos D-term) [25], in which case |F | = 0 and so |c| = 0\nduring inflation (although a non-zero value is expected once inflation ends and coherent\ninflaton oscillations begin, since\n\nR\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nd4 \u03b8S \u2020 S\u03a6\u2020 \u03a6 = |\u2202\u03bc S|2 + |FS |2 + ... |\u03a6|2 , with \u03a6 a\n\ngeneral scalar superfield). Since in the r.h. sneutrino curvaton scenario inflation must\nstill be driven by an inflaton, it is possible that the mechanism which suppresses |c|\nfor the inflaton during inflation also suppresses |c| for the curvaton.\nAfter inflation we generally expect a non-zero F-term from the energy density of the\ncoherently oscillating inflaton field. The solution of Eq. (35) during IMD corresponds\nto Eq. (36) with m = 3/2. Thus assuming that N has a constant value during inflation,\nNI , we find\nNosc\naosc\n=\nNI\nae\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\u03b3\n\nHI\n=\nHosc\n\n13\n\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\u03b3/3\n\n,\n\n(42)\n\n\fwhere Hosc \u2248 m\u00d1 .\nWe previously derived lower bounds on the value of HI compatible with the observed density perturbations based on the assumption that Nosc \u2248 NI . However, if\nc < 0 during IMD then the growth of N after inflation will allow a wider range of HI\nto be compatible with a given value of Nosc ,\n\u0010\n\nln \u03c0\u03b4\u03c1HNIosc\n2\u03b3\n\u0011\n\u0010\n=\n3\nln mHI\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n(43)\n\n\u00d1\n\nwhere we have used NI \u2248 HI /\u03c0\u03b4\u03c1 in Eq. (42). For example, for the case of Dirac\nneutrino masses, with \u03b4\u03c1 \u2248 10\u22125 , m\u00d1 \u2248 100 GeV and Nosc \u2248 10\u22124 M, it is possible to\n\nhave HI \u2248 106 GeV if \u03b3 = 1.45, corresponding to c = \u22124.3. This also shows that |c|\nneed not be small compared with 1 after inflation.\nWe conclude that the cH 2 correction to the r.h. sneutrino mass squared term is\nno more problematical for the curvaton than for the conventional inflaton: we require\nthat |c|\n\n<\n\u223c\n\n0.1 during inflation, in which case a significantly blue or red perturbation\n\nspectrum can arise depending on the sign and magnitude of c. After inflation |c|\nneed not be small compared with 1 (in the case where c < 0) and the cH 2 term can\n\neven widen the range of expansion rate and energy density during inflation which is\ncompatible with the observed density perturbations.\n(ii) Non-renormalisable superpotential corrections\nWe next consider adding Planck scale-suppressed non-renormalisable terms (NRTs)\nto the r.h. sneutrino superpotential,\n1\n\u03bbn N n\nWN = MN N 2 +\n,\n2\nn!M n\u22123\n\n(44)\n\nwhere n! is a symmetry factor and \u03bbn \u2248 1. For large enough |N| the scalar potential\nbecomes dominated by the NRT contribution,\nV (N) \u2248\n\n\u03bb2n N 2(n\u22121)\n.\n2n\u22121 (n \u2212 1)!2 M 2(n\u22123)\n\n(45)\n\nThe effect of the NRTs is to place an upper limit on the value of Nosc . During inflation,\n\u2032\u2032\n\nthe effective mass V (N) must be small compared with H 2 . After inflation and during\n14\n\n\f\u2032\u2032\n\nIMD, H 2 \u221d a\u22123 . Therefore V (N) may become larger than H 2 , at which point the\n\u2032\u2032\n\nN field will begin to evolve. N will then track the value at which V (N) \u2248 H 2 , since\n\u2032\u2032\n\nas H 2 decreases below V (N), the rate of roll of N will increase until the rate of\n\u2032\u2032\n\ndecrease of V (N) matches rate of the decrease of H 2 . In particular, when N will first\n\u2032\n\nbegins to slow-roll we have 3H \u1e44 \u2248 \u2212V (N). For V (N) \u221d N 2(n\u22121) , this has a solution\n\u2032\u2032\n\nN \u221d a3/(4\u22122n) , such that V (N) \u221d a\u22123 \u221d H 2 . So the slow-rolling solution will be such\n\u2032\u2032\n\nthat V (N) tracks H 2 and is of the same order of magnitude as H 2. Thus the value\n\u2032\u2032\n\nof N at which V (N) \u2248 H 2 places an upper limit on N for a given value of H, Nlim ,\ngiven by\nNlim\n\u03b1n\n\u2248 1\nM\n\u03bbnn\u22122\n\n\u0012\n\nH\nM\n\n1\n\u0013 n\u22122\n\n,\n\n(46)\n\nwhere \u03b1n is a constant of order 1. Therefore for Nlim to be greater than Nosc at Hosc\nwe require that n is greater than nlim , where\nln\n\nnlim = 2 +\nln\n\n\u0010\n\nHosc\nM\n\n\u0011\n\n1\n\u03bbnn\u22122 Nosc\n\u03b1n M\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(47)\n\nFor the case of Dirac neutrino masses, we require from the late decay condition\nthat Nosc /M\n\n>\n\u223c\n\n1 \u00d7 10\u22125 . Thus with Hosc \u2248 m\u00d1 = 100 GeV, Nosc /M \u2248 1 \u00d7 10\u22125\n\nand \u03bbn \u2248 \u03b1n \u2248 1, we require that n > nlim = 5.3. Thus a suppression of Planckscale suppressed NRTs in the r.h. neutrino superpotential of dimension less than 6 is\nrequired in this case. This might be achieved by a modest discrete symmetry.\nFor the case of Majorana neutrino masses, with Hosc \u2248 m\u00d1 = 100 GeV, Nosc /M \u2248\n0.01 and \u03bbn \u2248 \u03b1n \u2248 1, we require that n > nlim = 10.2. This is a significant problem\nfor a Majorana r.h. sneutrino curvaton. It requires a high degree of suppression of\nPlanck-suppressed non-renormalisable terms, eliminating all NRTs in the r.h. neutrino\nsuperpotential up to n < 11. However, as we will discuss, there is likely to be a more\nsevere problem for the Majorana r.h. sneutrino curvaton, namely the survival of the\nr.h. sneutrino condensate in the inflaton decay product background.\nAlthough Planck scale-suppressed NRTs appear to disfavour a r.h. sneutrino curvaton, it should be noted that conventional SUSY inflation models also have problems\n\n15\n\n\fwith Planck scale-suppressed NRTs. Chaotic inflation models require that the inflaton expectation value is greater than M [27], whilst SUSY hybrid inflation models\nrequire that N is close to M when scales corresponding to observed cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) perturbations exit the horizon (assuming natural values of the\nrenormalisable gauge and Yukawa couplings) [25, 26]. In this sense the r.h. sneutrino\ncurvaton may be no more problematical that conventional SUSY inflation models with\nrespect to Planck scale-suppressed superpotential terms.\n\n3.5\n\nDecay temperature of the Dirac and Majorana r.h. sneutrino condensate\n\nThe neutrino mass is related to the Yukawa coupling by m\u03bd = \u03bb\u03bd vu . The r.h. sneutrino\nmass is simply given by the SUSY breaking mass term, m\u00d1 = mo \u2248 100 GeV. Thus\nthe temperature of the Universe when the condensate decays, T\u00d1 d , is given by \u0393\u00d1 d \u2248\n\nH(T\u00d1 d ), where H(T ) = kT T 2 /MP l and kT = (4\u03c0 3 g(T )/45)1/2. Thus with the r.h.\n\nsneutrino decay rate given by Eq. (23), the temperature of r.h. sneutrino decay is, in\ngeneral,\nT\u00d1 d =\n\n\u03bb2\u03bd m\u00d1 MP l\n4\u03c0kT\u00d1d\n\n!1/2\n\n.\n\n(48)\n\nFor the case of the Dirac r.h. sneutrinos, Eq. (48) implies that\nT\u00d1 d =\n\nm2\u03bd m\u00d1 MP l\n4\u03c0vu2 kT\u00d1d\n\n!1/2\n\nm\u03bd\n= 4.4\n0.1 eV\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\nm\u00d1\n100 GeV\n\n\u00131/2\n\nMeV ,\n\n(49)\n\nwhere we have used vu \u2248 100 GeV and kT\u00d1 d \u2248 5, corresponding to \u03b3, e\u00b1 and \u03bdi\n(i = 1, 2, 3) as light degrees of freedom [20]. Thus the Dirac r.h. sneutrino condensate\ntypically decays in the temperature range 1\u221210 MeV. (Note that if the energy density\nof the r.h. sneutrino condensate dominates the energy density of the Universe when\nit decays, T\u00d1 d should then be interpreted as the temperature to which the Universe\nreheats after the condensate decays.) Since the Dirac r.h. sneutrino condensate decays well below the temperature at which weakly interacting particles of mass of the\norder of mW freeze out of chemical equilibrium (Tf reeze \u2248 1 \u2212 10 GeV), an important\nconstraint on the Dirac r.h. sneutrino curvaton is the requirement that the lightest\n16\n\n\fsupersymmetric particles (LSPs) produced in decay of the r.h. sneutrino condensate\ndo not overclose the Universe. This requires that the LSPs decay before nucleosynthesis at T \u2248 1 MeV, in order that the light element abundances are not disrupted by\nphoto-dissociation due to LSP decay cascades [24]. Therefore the LSP lifetime must\nsatisfy\n\u03c4LSP\n\n<\n\u223c\n\nH \u22121 (T \u2248 1 MeV) \u2248 1s .\n\n(50)\n\nThus although the LSP must be unstable its lifetime can be much longer than the time\nrequired to escape particle detectors (\u223c 10\u22128 s), in which case experimental searches\nfor SUSY particles would be unaffected. A wider range of LSP candidates would be\nallowed than in the R-parity conserving case where the LSP properties are constrained\nby the thermal relic cold dark matter density. This might be testable at future colliders\nsuch as the CERN Large Hadron Collider.\nFor the case of Majorana r.h. sneutrinos, Eq. (48) implies that\nT\u00d1 d =\n\nm\u03bd m2\u00d1 MP l\n4\u03c0vu2 kT\u00d1d\n\n!1/2\n\n= 2.2 \u00d7 103\n\n\u0012\n\nm\u03bd\n0.1 eV\n\n\u00131/2 \u0012\n\nm\u00d1\n100 GeV\n\n\u0013\n\nGeV .\n\n(51)\n\nThus since m\u00d1 typically will not be much larger than 1 TeV as a result of the late decay\ncondition, Eq. (30), we expect that T\u00d1 d \u223c 104 GeV for the Majorana r.h. sneutrino\ncondensate.\n\n3.6\n\nThermalisation of the right-handed sneutrino condensate\n\nWe have been assuming throughout the preceeding discussion that the r.h. sneutrino\ncondensate survives in the enviroment of the inflaton decay products. However, it\nis possible that r.h. sneutrinos in the condensate could be inelastically scattered by\ncollisions with the MSSM particles in the inflaton decay product background. If the\nrelativistic particles in the background have energy Ed , then the scattering crosssection of a r.h. sneutrino, at rest in the condensate, from a relativistic particle in the\ninflaton decay product background via Higgs(ino) or (s)lepton exchange is expected\nto be\n\u03c3\u00d1 sc \u2248\n\n\u03b1\u03bd \u03b1g\n,\n2\nECM\n\n17\n\n(52)\n\n\fwhere \u03b1\u03bd = \u03bb2\u03bd /4\u03c0, \u03b1g = g 2 /4\u03c0, where g is a typical MSSM gauge/Yukawa coupling\nand ECM \u2248\n\nq\n\nEd m\u00d1 is the centre of mass energy of the process. The scattering rate\n\nfrom the decay product background is then \u0393\u00d1 sc = n\u03c3\u00d1 sc , where n is the number\ndensity of particles in the inflaton decay product background. The largest scattering\nrate will occur for the largest n and smallest Ed , which corresponds to thermalised\ndecay products (T\n\n<\n\u223c\n\nTth ). In this case n = g(T )T 3/\u03c0 2 and Ed \u2248 T [20]. Therefore\n\u0393\u00d1 sc \u2248\n\ng(T )\u03b1\u03bd \u03b1g T 2\n.\n\u03c02\nm\u00d1\n\n(53)\n\nThen assuming that thermalisation of the inflaton decay products occurs during RD,\nthe condition that the condensate is unthermalised is \u0393\u00d1 sc\n\n<\n\u223c\n\nH(T ) \u2261 kT T 2 /MP l , which\n\nimplies\n4\u03c0 3 kT\n\u03b1g g(T )\n\n\u03bb\u03bd <\n\u223c\n\n!1/2 \u0012\n\nm\u00d1\nMP l\n\n\u00131/2\n\n.\n\n(54)\n\nFor the case of Dirac neutrino masses, this condition becomes\nm\u03bd <\n\u223c\n\n4\u03c0 3 kT vu2\n\u03b1g g(T )\n\n!1/2 \u0012\n\nm\u00d1\nMP l\n\n\u00131/2\n\n\u2248\n\n1.0\n1/2\n\n\u03b1g\n\n\u0012\n\nm\u00d1\n100 GeV\n\n\u00131/2 \u0012\n\nvu\nkeV,\n100 GeV\n\u0013\n\n(55)\n\nwhere we have used g(T ) \u2248 200 and kT \u2248 20. Therefore, since m\u03bd \u2248 0.1eV, the Dirac\nr.h. sneutrino condensate will not be thermalised.\nFor the case of Majorana neutrino masses, the non-thermalisation condition becomes\nm\u03bd <\n\u223c\n\n4\u03c0 3 kT\n\u03b1g g(T )\n\n!\n\n10\u22125\nvu2\n\u2248\nMP l\n\u03b1g\n\n\u0012\n\nvu\n100 GeV\n\n\u00132\n\neV .\n\n(56)\n\nThus typically we expect that this will not be satisfied. For example, if we consider\n\u03b1g to correspond to the top quark Yukawa (r.h. sneutrinos scattering from thermal\ntop quarks via Hu exchange) then \u03b1g \u2248 0.1 and so m\u03bd\n\n<\n\u223c\n\n10\u22124 eV would be required\n\nto evade thermalisation. Therefore with m\u03bd \u2248 0.1eV the Majorana r.h. sneutrino\ncondensate will be thermalised at Tth , when the inflaton decay product background\nthermalises.\nOne possible escape from this conclusion is that the inflaton decay product background could remain unthermalised until the energy density of the sneutrino condensate comes to dominate the energy density of the Universe. Since the Majorana r.h. sneutrino condensate decays at a temperature typically around 104 GeV,\n18\n\n\fif Tth\n\n<\n\u223c\n\n104 GeV then the Majorana r.h. sneutrino curvaton may remain a possibility.\n\nFor the case of perturbative inflaton decays, the thermalisation temperature of the inflaton decay product background Tth , Eq. (8), is proportional to (TR /mS )3 . Therefore\na very low background thermalisation temperature is a possibility if TR \u226a mS .\nThe above applies to condensate thermalisation during RD. It is straightforward to\nsee that if condensate thermalisation does not occur during RD then it will not occur\nearlier during IMD. If we assume that the background is thermalised during IMD\n(which should give the largest rate of condensate thermalisation), then since during\nIMD \u0393\u00d1 sc \u221d T 2 and H \u221d T 4 , it follows that once T > TR the thermalisation condition\n\u0393\u00d1 sc\n\n>\n\u223c\n\nH will become more difficult to satisfy. Thus if the r.h. sneutrino condensate\n\ndoes not thermalise during RD it will not thermalise at all.\nIn discussing the thermalisation rate, we have implicitly assumed that the mass\nof the Hu and L fields coupling directly to the r.h. sneutrino condensate is small\ncompared with T and ECM \u2248 (T m\u00d1 )1/2 . The effective mass is given by \u03bb\u03bd < N >,\nwhere < N > is the amplitude of the coherent oscillations. In general < N > is given\nby\n< N >=\n\n\u0012\n\naosc\na\n\n\u00133/2\n\nNosc \u2248\n\n\u0012\n\nT\nTR\n\n\u00133/2 \u0012\n\nHR\nNosc .\nHosc\n\u0013\n\n(57)\n\nThus for the case of Majorana r.h. sneutrinos the effective mass is given by\n1/2\n\nkT T 3/2 TR\n\u221a\n\u03bb\u03bd < N >=\n8\u03c0\n\nm\u03bd\nm\u00d1 vu2\n\n!1/2 \u0012\n\nNosc\nM\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(58)\n\nwhich implies that\n\u03bb\u03bd < N >= 4 \u00d7 10\nTR\n\u00d7\n8\n10 GeV\n\u0012\n\n\u00131/2\n\nm\u03bd\n0.1 eV\n\n\u00131/2 \u0012\n\nT\n4\n10 GeV\n\n100 GeV\nm\u00d1\n\n!1/2 \u0012\n\nNosc\nM\n\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u00133/2\n\nGeV ,\n\nwhere we have used kT \u2248 20 and vu = 100 GeV. Thus for Nosc /M < 1, m\u00d1\n\n(59)\n>\n\u223c\n\n100 GeV\n\nand for a decay temperature of 104 GeV for the Majorana r.h. sneutrino, we find that\n\u03bb\u03bd < N > is smaller than T and ECM and so may be neglected when considering\ncondensate thermalisation.\n\n19\n\n\fFor the case of Dirac r.h. sneutrinos the effective mass is given by\n1/2\n\n\u03bb\u03bd < N >=\n\nkT T 3/2 TR m\u03bd\n\u221a\n8\u03c0vu m\u00d1\n\n\u0012\n\nNosc\nM\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(60)\n\nwhich implies that\n\u03bb\u03bd < N >= 3 \u00d7 10\nTR\n\u00d7\n8\n10 GeV\n\u0012\n\n\u00131/2\n\n\u221215\n\n\u0012\n\nm\u03bd\n0.1 eV\n\n100 GeV\nm\u00d1\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\n!\u0012\n\nT\n10 MeV\n\nNosc\nM\n\n\u0013\n\n\u00133/2\n\nGeV .\n\n(61)\n\nThus the effective mass is generally negligible in the case of Dirac r.h. sneutrinos.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have considered the possibility that a r.h. sneutrino could play the role of a\ncurvaton in the cosmology of the MSSM extended to accomodate neutrino masses.\nIn the case of a Dirac r.h. sneutrino, the expectation value of the r.h. sneutrino\nat the onset of its coherent oscillations must satisfy Nosc /M\n\n>\n\u223c\n\n10\u22125 , in order that\n\nthe energy density of the r.h. sneutrino condensate dominates the Universe when it\ndecays. As a result, Planck-scale corrections to the r.h. neutrino superpotential must\nbe suppressed, eliminating all superpotential terms \u221d N n with n < 6. cH 2 corrections\n\nto the r.h. sneutrino mass squared must also be suppressed during inflation (|c| <\n\u223c 0.1).\nThe inflaton sector of the Dirac r.h. sneutrino curvaton scenario can have a much\nsmaller expansion rate during inflation than conventional SUSY inflation models, with\nHI \u2248 109 GeV possible. (Including the effect of a negative cH 2 term after inflation,\nvalues of HI as small as 106 GeV or less are possible.)\n\nIn addition, depending on the sign and magnitude of the cH 2 correction, it is\npossible to have a significantly blue (c > 0) or red (c < 0) perturbation spectrum. The\nrecent suggestion from WMAP observations [23] of a blue perturbation spectrum on\ncomoving scales of the order of 500 Mpc could therefore be accomodated within the\ncurvaton scenario.\nThe late decay of the Dirac r.h. sneutrino condensate (at T \u2248 1\u221210 MeV) requires\nthat R-parity be broken and that the LSP decays before nucleosynthesis, corresponding\n20\n\n\fto a lifetime shorter than 1s. (Since this would result in the loss of LSP cold dark\nmatter, a new dark matter candidate would also be needed.) Thus the Dirac curvaton\nscenario predicts that LSP properties will typically be inconsistent with thermal relic\ncold dark matter.\nIn the case of a Majorana r.h. sneutrino curvaton, we find that the requirement that\nthe r.h. sneutrino condensate dominates the energy density of the Universe before it\ndecays implies that Nosc /M\n\n>\n\u223c\n\n0.01. This imposes a strong constraint on Planck-scale\n\nsuppressed contributions to the r.h. neutrino superpotential, requiring elimination\nof all terms \u221d N n with n < 11. However, a more severe problem may arise from\nscattering of the condensate sneutrinos by particles in the thermal background, since\nit is likely that the Majorana r.h. sneutrino condensate will be thermalised as soon\nas the inflaton decay product background thermalises. Thus if the inflaton decay\nproducts thermalise earlier than the time of r.h. sneutrino condensate domination of\nthe energy density then the Majorana curvaton scenario will be ruled out. Only a\nsufficiently low background thermalisation temperature could evade this conclusion.\nTherefore, although not absolutely excluded, the Majorana r.h. sneutrino curvaton\nscenario appears to be more difficult to implement that the Dirac curvaton scenario.\nIn conclusion, we find that a r.h. sneutrino can serve as the source of the density\nperturbations leading to structure formation. For the favoured case of a Dirac r.h.\nsneutrino, this requires some suppression of its Planck-scale suppressed superpotential\nself-interactions together with sufficiently rapid R-parity violation. If these conditions\nare met, the Dirac r.h. sneutrino would provide us with the only curvaton candidate\nwhich is strongly motivated by particle physics.\nNote Added: After completing this work we became aware of [28] and [29], which\nalso discuss the case of a Majorana r.h. sneutrino curvaton.\n\nReferences\n[1] For a recent review, see R.N.Mohapatra, hep-ph/0211252.\n[2] H.P.Nilles, Phys.
