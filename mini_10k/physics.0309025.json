Koschmieder\nCenter for Statistical Mechanics, The University of Texas at Austin\nAustin, TX 78712 USA\ne-mail: koschmieder@mail.utexas.edu\n\nWe have shown previously that the mass of the muon neutrino can be determined\nfrom the energy released in the decay of the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons, and that the mass of the\nelectron neutrino can be determined from the energy released in the decay of the\nneutron. We will now show how the mass of the tau neutrino can be determined\nfrom the decay of the Ds\u00b1 mesons.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nAs we have shown with the standing wave model of the stable mesons and\nbaryons [1] it follows from the decay of the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons that the mass of the\nmuon neutrinos \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u0304\u03bc must be m(\u03bd\u03bc ) = m(\u03bd\u0304\u03bc ) = 47.5 meV/c2 . We have\nalso found in [1] that it follows from the decay of the neutron that the mass\nof the antielectron neutrino \u03bd\u0304e should be m(\u03bd\u0304e ) = 0.55 meV/c2 . We have\nto correct this value whose calculation was based on the assumption that\nthe neutron, whose mass is \u2248 2K \u00b1 , is the superposition of a K + and a K \u2212\nmeson. However, our investigation of the spin of the mesons and baryons [2]\nhas shown that such a superposition does not produce spin s = 1/2, as is\nrequired. On the other hand, the superposition of two K 0 mesons has spin\ns = 1/2; actually the neutron must be the superposition of a K 0 and a K\u0304 0\nmeson, because of conservation of strangeness in the strong interaction that\ncreated the neutron. According to the standing wave model the superposition\nof a K 0 and a K\u0304 0 consists of neutrinos only and their oscillation energy. The\nneutrinos are arranged in a cubic lattice, each cell containing \u03bd\u03bc , \u03bd\u0304\u03bc , \u03bde , \u03bd\u0304e\nneutrinos. The total number of the neutrinos in the neutron is 4N, with N\n= 2.854*109, twice as many neutrinos as if the neutron were a superposition\nof K + and K \u2212 . That means that, when the neutron decays via n \u2192 p + e\u2212\n+ \u03bd\u0304e , N antielectron neutrinos \u03bd\u0304e share the difference \u2206 of the energy in the\nrest mass of the neutron and the energy in the rest mass of the proton \u2206 =\n1.29332 MeV. After the rest mass of the electron, also emitted in the decay\n1\n\n\fof the neutron, is subtracted from \u2206, and \u2206 \u2212 m(e)c2 = 0.782321 MeV is\ndivided by N, not by N/2 as in [1], we find that the mass of the antielectron\nneutrino must be\nm(\u03bd\u0304e ) = 0.275 meV/c2 .\n\n(1)\n\nFrom the decay of the antineutron n\u0304 \u2192 p\u0304 + e+ + \u03bde follows in principle\nthat the mass of the electron neutrino should be m(\u03bde ) = 0.275 meV/c2 , or\nthat m(\u03bde ) = m(\u03bd\u0304e ).\n\n2\n\nThe mass of \u03bd\u03c4\n\nWe will now determine the mass of the \u03c4 neutrino m(\u03bd\u03c4 ) from the decay of the\nDs\u00b1 mesons in a way which is analogous to the way how we have determined\nthe mass of \u03bd\u03bc . The Ds\u00b1 mesons decay via e.g.\nDs+ \u2192 \u03c4 + + \u03bd\u03c4 (6.4%) ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c4 + is the positive \u03c4 meson or lepton. The decay of Ds\u2212 has the conjugate particles on the right hand side of (2). The 6.4 percentage of this mode\nof decay is, by a small margin, the most frequent of the leptonic modes of\ndecay of Ds\u00b1 . The subsequent decay of \u03c4 \u00b1 is given by e.g.\n\u03c4 + \u2192 \u03c0 + + \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 (11.06%) ,\n\n(3)\n\nwith the antitau neutrino \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 . The percentage of this mode of decay of \u03c4 \u00b1 is\nlikewise only one of the very many modes of decay of \u03c4 \u00b1 .\nIf it is true, as we have postulated in [1], that the particles consist of the\nparticles into which they decay, then it follows from Eqs.(2,3) that the Ds\u00b1\nmesons consist of \u03bd\u03c4 and \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 neutrinos, plus the \u03bd\u03bc , \u03bd\u0304\u03bc , \u03bde , \u03bd\u0304e neutrinos in the\n\u03c0 \u00b1 mesons in Eq.(3). The cells of the lattice of the Ds\u00b1 mesons contain 6\ntypes of neutrinos, not 4 types as in the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons. The cubic lattice used\nin the standing wave model can, however, be retained if we consider, instead\nof a simple cubic lattice as the NaCl lattice, a body-centered cubic lattice in\nwhich a particle different from the particles in the corners of the simple cubic\ncell sits at the center of each cell of the lattice. This seems to accomodate\nonly 5 neutrino types, whereas we have found that there must be 6 neutrino\ntypes in the cells of the Ds\u00b1 mesons. However, because of conservation of\nlepton numbers during the creation of the Ds\u00b1 mesons it is necessary that a\n2\n\n\fnumber of antitau neutrinos equal to the number of tau neutrinos is present\nin the lattice. The antitau neutrinos can easily be accomodated in a lattice of\nbody-centered cells in which the center particles are alternately tau neutrinos\nand antitau neutrinos.\nAs explained in [1] there must be N = 2.854*109 neutrinos in the \u03c0 \u00b1\nlattice, and consequently there are N/4 simple cubic cells in \u03c0 \u00b1 . The number\nof cells in the \u03c0 \u00b1 lattice and the lattice of the neutron seem to be the same,\nbecause the radii of the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons and the proton are, within the accuracy\nof the measurements, the same, and we assume that the size of the proton\nand neutron are the same. It appears that the superposition of a K 0 and a\nK\u0304 0 meson creating a neutron does not change the size of the lattice of these\nparticles, or the number of their cubic cells. We will therefore assume that\nthe superposition of a proton, an antineutron and a \u03c0 0 meson creating the\nDs\u00b1 mesons, with m(Ds\u00b1 ) = 0.978*( m(p) + m(n\u0304) + m(\u03c0 0 ) ), does not change\nthe number of the cells in the lattice either. In other words we assume that\nthe size of the proton or neutron is the same as the size of the Ds\u00b1 mesons. If\nthere are N/4 body-centered cells in the Ds\u00b1 meson then there must be N/8\ntau neutrinos and antitau neutrinos each in the lattice of Ds\u00b1 . The energy \u2206\nreleased in the decay Ds+ \u2192 \u03c4 + + \u03bd\u03c4 (Eq.(2)) is given by\n\u2206 = m(Ds\u00b1 )c2 \u2212 m (\u03c4 \u00b1 )c2 = 191.51 MeV .\n\n(4)\n\nIf this energy originates from the rest mass of all \u03bd\u03c4 neutrinos, respectively\nfrom all \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 neutrinos, in the decay of Ds\u00b1 then it follows, with the number of\n\u03bd\u03c4 or \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 neutrinos being N/8, that\nm(\u03bd\u03c4 ) = m(\u03bd\u0304\u03c4 ) = 536.8 meV/c2 \u2248 0.54 eV/c2 .\n\n(5)\n\nSince in the decay of Ds+ only a single tau neutrino is emitted one must\nwonder why the energy \u2206 released in the decay should be equal to the sum\nof the rest masses of all tau neutrinos in Ds+ . The first indication that \u2206\nis not the energy carried by a single tau neutrino in the Ds+ meson comes\nfrom the magnitude of \u2206 which amounts to practically 10% of the energy in\nthe rest mass of Ds+ . This is incompatible with the basic tenet that there\nmust be, according to Fourier analysis, a continuum of frequencies in a body\ncreated in a high energy collision of 10\u221223 sec duration, which does not make\nit possible that a single neutrino out of 109 neutrinos has a rest mass plus an\noscillation energy amounting to 10% of the rest mass of Ds\u00b1 . That the source\nof \u2206 is the rest masses of all \u03bd\u03c4 , respectively \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 , neutrinos can be inferred\n3\n\n\ffrom the disappearance of one of the two neutrino types in the secondary\ndecays following the primary decay of Ds\u00b1 . To be specific, the \u03bd\u03c4 in the\ndecay of Ds+ (Eq.(2)) does not appear neither in the decay of \u03c4 + (Eq.(3))\nnor in the subsequent decay of \u03c0 + which is in also (3), nor in the decay of\nthe \u03bc+ meson which follows. With the primary decay of Ds+ , (Eq.(2)), the\ntau neutrinos seem to have been eliminated, which will certainly be the case\nwhen the energy of the rest masses of all \u03bd\u03c4 has been consumed by \u2206. This\nprocess is analogous to the disappearance of one type of muon neutrino after\nthe decay of the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons, as discussed in [1], where we have shown that\nthe oscillation energy of all neutrinos in \u03c0 \u00b1 is conserved in the decay, where\ntherefore the energy in the emitted neutrino can come only from the sum of\nthe rest masses of all neutrinos of the type of neutrino emitted in the decay.\nFinally we want to show that the body-centered lattice of the Ds\u00b1 meson\nleads also to the correct spin s(Ds\u00b1 ) = 0. We have shown in [2] and [3], e.g.\nin context with the spin of the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons s(\u03c0 \u00b1 ) = 0, that the spin of the\nelectric charge carried by the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons is canceled by the sum of the spin\nvectors of all neutrinos in the lattice. Of all the spin vectors of the O(109 )\nneutrinos in the cubic lattice of the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons only the spin vector of the\ncentral neutrino remains, which then cancels the spin vector of the electric\ncharge. The same applies for the body-centered lattice of the Ds\u00b1 mesons. Of\nthe spin vectors of all neutrinos in the Ds\u00b1 lattice only the spin vector of the\ncentral neutrino, in this case of a \u03bd\u03c4 or \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 neutrino, remains which cancels\nthe spin vector of the electric charge of Ds\u00b1 . Consequently s(Ds\u00b1 ) = 0, as it\nmust be.\n\n3\n\nConclusions\n\nMaking use of the decay of the Ds\u00b1 mesons Ds\u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4 \u00b1 + \u03bd\u03c4 (\u03bd\u0304\u03c4 ) we can show\nthat the mass of the tau neutrino must be m(\u03bd\u03c4 ) \u2248 0.54 eV/c2 . We also find\nthat m(\u03bd\u03c4 ) = m(\u03bd\u0304\u03c4 ).\nREFERENCES\n[1] E.L.Koschmieder, arXiv:physics/0211100 (2002),\nChaos, Solitons and Fractals 18,1129 (2003).\n[2] E.L.Koschmieder, arXiv:physics/0301060 (2003), Hadr.J.
