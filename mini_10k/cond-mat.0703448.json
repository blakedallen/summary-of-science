The curved nature of the fronts produced by\navalanches is reflected in the time-of-arrival at micro-Hall sensors placed at the surface of the sample.\nAssuming that the avalanche interface is a spherical bubble that grows with a radius proportional\nto time, we are able to locate the approximate ignition point of each avalanche in a two-dimensional\ncross-section of the crystal. For the samples used in these studies, avalanches in a given crystal are\nfound to originate in a small region with a radius of roughly 150\u03bcm.\n\nMn12 -acetate, or [Mn12 O12 (CH3 COO)16 (H2 O)4 ]*2CH3\nCOOH*4H2 O] (hereafter referred to as Mn12 -ac), is a\nprototypical molecular magnet composed of magnetic\nmolecules with cores consisting of twelve Mn atoms\nstrongly coupled by exchange to form superparamagnetic\nclusters of large spin S = 10 at low temperatures [1],[2].\nArranged in a centered tetragonal lattice, the Mn12\nclusters are subject to strong magnetic anisotropy along\nthe symmetry axis (the c-axis of the crystal). Below\nthe blocking temperature of about 3.5 K, the crystal\nexhibits remarkable staircase magnetic hysteresis due to\nresonant quantum spin tunneling between energy levels\non opposite sides of the anisotropy barrier corresponding\nto different spin projections along the easy axis[3].\nRecent local time-resolved measurements of fast magnetization reversal in single crystals of Mn12 -ac have indicated that a magnetization avalanche spreads as a narrow\ninterface that propagates through the crystal at a constant velocity that is roughly two orders of magnitude\nsmaller than the speed of sound [4]. This has been attributed to \"magnetic deflagration\", in analogy with the\npropagation of a flame front through a flammable chemical substance, a phenomenon called chemical deflagration [5]. In the earlier study [4], the avalanches occurred\nstochastically in response to a time-varying (swept) magnetic field applied along the easy axis of the Mn12 -ac\ncrystals. Under the conditions and for the samples used,\navalanches invariably originated at or near the long end\nof the crystal, and the magnetic front detected by sensors placed near the middle detected the propagation of\na planar (or approximately planar) propagating front.\nIn this paper we report a study of avalanches triggered\nin a swept magnetic field at points within the interior of\nthe crystals rather than at the edges. Assuming that the\nvelocity of propagation of the avalanche is isotropic and\ngives rise to a spherical propagating front, the time-of-\n\narrival at sensors placed at the surface of the sample allowed us to trace each avalanche back to its approximate\npoint of ignition. For the crystals used in the current\nexperiment, the avalanches typically originate in some\nsmall region within a crystal.\nThe measurements are described in detail in reference\n[4]. Small Hall bars (six or seven, depending on the sample) of dimensions 30\u00d730 \u03bcm2 placed at 80 \u03bcm (center to\ncenter) intervals were used to measure the magnetization\nof single crystals of Mn12 -ac in the form of parallelepipeds\nof typical cross section 0.3 \u00d7 0.3 mm2 and length 1 to 1.4\nmm. Operating at 0.255 K, avalanches were recorded\nfor magnetic fields between 1.5 and 3.5 T. The Hall sensors were aligned to detect the magnetic induction of the\nsample in the x-direction, Bx , which is proportional to\nthe spatial derivative of Mz in the region near the sensor, Bx \u221d \u2202Mz /\u2202z.[6] Bx is proportional Mz , and for a\nuniform magnetization in the z-direction, derives mostly\nfrom the strong gradient at the sample ends. During\nan avalanche, there is a large contribution to Bx at the\nfront, the narrow propagating interface between regions\nof opposing magnetization, where \u2202Mz /\u2202z is large. Each\nsensor thus registers a large signal as the front passes by.\nThe sign of the peak, positive or negative, is determined\nby the direction of the field lines.\nFigure 1 shows the time evolution of an avalanche\nstarting from some region away from the Hall sensors\nnear the end of the sample. The schematic (top center)\nshows the magnetization of the crystal and the field lines\nthat give rise to the observed signal. The graphed inset\nshows the peak position of the signal plotted as a function\nof time; the slope of the straight line yields the velocity\nof propagation of the front. These data are consistent\nwith the results of reference[4].\nFigure 2 shows the sensor traces for an avalanche observed in a different sample that produces both positive\n\n\f2\n\n2.0\n\nsensor\nSensor Position (mm)\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n1.5\n\n0.8\n0.6\n\n1.0\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0.52\n\n0.54\n\n0.56\n\n0.58\n\nBx (103 G)\n\n1.0\n\n3\n\nBx (10 G)\n\n1.5\n\nsensor\n\n1\n\ntime (ms)\n\n0.50\n\n0.5\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n0.0\n-0.5\n-1.0\n\n0.0\n-1.5\n\n-0.50\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\ntime ( ms)\n\nFIG. 1: Signals recorded during a magnetic avalanche by Hall\nsensors placed on the surface near the middle of a bar-shaped\nsample of Mn12 -acetate. The schematic indicates the field line\nconfiguration that gives rise to the signals as the avalanche\npropagates from one end of the sample to the other. The inset\nshows sensor positions versus the time at which each sensor\nrecorded the peak amplitude for an avalanche that started at\nthe top and travels downward.\n\nand negative signals. As before, we plot the positions of\nthe peaks as a function of time for two such avalanches\nin Fig. 3. In contrast with the straight line shown in\nthe inset to Fig. 1, which we have attributed to the\nplanar front of an avalanche propagating from the end\nof the sample, we see a \"V-shaped\" curve with negative\nand positive curved branches. This can be understood\nas an avalanche starting near the middle of the sample\nand propagating in opposite directions towards the sample ends. As illustrated in the schematic inset in Fig. 2,\nthe signals of opposite sign are due to field lines pointing\nin opposite directions corresponding to the upper (lower)\nfront traveling upward (downward). Figure 3(a) shows an\navalanche initiating above the third Hall sensor while Fig.\n3(b) shows one originating between the fourth and fifth.\nThe avalanches of Fig. 3 clearly show curvature absent\nfrom the planar front of Fig. 1 and are distinctly different from one another. We propose that the curvature is\ndetermined by the distance from the ignition point to the\n\n-2.0\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n\n0.4\n\n0.45\n\ntime (ms)\n\nFIG. 2: Sensor signals for an avalanche starting near the middle of the sample. The schematic indicates the (quadrupolar)\nfield configuration associated with avalanche fronts propagating in opposite directions toward the two ends, giving rise to\nthe observed positive-going and negative-going signals.\n\nsurface on which the Hall sensors are mounted. This can\nbe understood by simple geometric considerations.\nWe assume the avalanche grows as a spherical bubble\nwith a radius growing linearly in time, r = vt. In other\nwords,\nv 2 t2 = (x \u2212 x0 )2 + (y \u2212 y0 )2 + (z \u2212 z0 )2 ,\nwhere (x0 , y0 , z0 ) is the ignition point within the sample.\nWith Hall bars along the z-axis and y = x = 0, the\nposition of the peak as a function of time is given as the\nintersection of the spherical bubble with the z-axis,\np\n(1)\nz(t) = z0 \u00b1 v 2 t2 + d2 ,\np\nwhere d is the distance (y0 )2 + (x0 )2 between the point\nof ignition and the z-axis containing the Hall sensor array.\nBy fitting the peak positions in time with this expression, we can extract values of z0 and d, and thereby determine the point where the avalanche started. Thus, for\nexample, frames (a) and (b) of Fig. 3 show data with distinctly different curvatures for two different avalanches\noriginating within the bulk of the same sample.

In contrast with the inset shown in Fig. 1, the traces\nare not straight lines, and the curvature is different for the\navalanches shown in frame (a) and frame (b). As shown in\nthe text, frame (a) corresponds to an avalanche triggered near\nthe surface while frame (b) shows an avalanche triggered far\nfrom the surface on which the sensor was mounted.\n\nlustrated in the schematic diagrams, the smaller curvature of Fig. 3a is caused by an avalanche triggered near\nthe surface on which the sensors are mounted, while the\nlarger curvature of Fig. 3b is due to an avalanche originating further away.\nFor a particular sample of dimensions 1.4 \u00d7 0.3 \u00d7 0.3\nmm3 , Fig. 4 shows a distribution of the avalanche ignition points projected onto the d \u2212 z plane. Hall sensors\nwere placed near the middle of the sample extending from\nz \u2248 0.4 to z \u2248 1.0 mm. The vertical lines near the ends of\nthe sample indicate \"blind\" regions outside the Hall sensor array where avalanches could not be traced back to\ntheir origin. Only \u2248 5 % of the avalanches were triggered\nin these regions. For this sample, the ignition points lie\npredominantly within a region near the center of radius\nroughly 150\u03bcm.\nIn most of the crystals we have studied, the avalanches\noriginate at the ends. This suggests that dipolar demagnetizing fields, or other magnetic effects associated with\n\nFIG. 4: Distribution of ignition points of avalanches for a\nparticular sample projected onto the d \u2212 z plane. The double\narrow indicates the region spanned by Hall sensors; the vertical lines designate the regions beyond the Hall sensor array\nwhere avalanches could not be traced to their points of origin.\n\nthe surface, play a role in the ignition process. In this paper we have reported the observation of avalanches that\noriginate in a region within the bulk of a crystal. We suggest that these bulk-initiated avalanches originate from\n\"weak\" regions of the crystal where the density of defects\n(or perhaps the second species known to exist in Mn12\nac) is higher. The location and effect of these regions\nshould vary from crystal to crystal and should depend\non growing conditions.\n\nThis work was supported at City College by NSF grant\nDMR-00451605. E.
