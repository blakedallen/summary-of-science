Preliminary results obtained with 320g bolometers are described. After a\nfew weeks of data taking, data accumulated with one of these detectors already allow to reach\nthe upper part of the DAMA region. Prospects for the present run and the second stage of\nthe experiment, EDELWEISS-II, using an innovative reversed cryostat allowing data taking\nwith 100 detectors, are briefly described.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe EDELWEISS experiment is a WIMP direct detection experiment set in the Fr\u00e9jus Underground Laboratory, adjacent to a highway tunnel connecting France and Italy under the Alps.\nThe rock overburden reduces the muon background flux by a factor \u2248 2 \u00d7 106 while the neutron\nflux, originating mainly from the surrounding rock, is \u2248 4 \u00d7 10\u22126 neutron/cm2 /s 1 . The experimental setup of the EDELWEISS experiment has been described elsewhere 2 . EDELWEISS has\ndeveloped cryogenic germanium detectors with simultaneous measurement of charge and phonon\nsignals. A detailed description of these detectors can be found in L'Hote et al. and Navick et\n\n\fEdelweiss preliminary - guard ring excluded\nCounts / kg / day\n\n30 < Erecoil < 100 keV\n10\n\n3\n\n70g 1997\n\n\u03b3\n\n70g 2000\n320g 2000\n10\n\n2\n\n\u03b2\nn\n\n10\n\n1\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nFigure 1: Ratio of the ionization yield to the recoil energy (quenching factor) for events with recoil energies\nbetween 30 and 100 keV. The electron recoil yield has been normalised to 1 using \u03b3-ray calibration sources and\nis expected to be approximately 0.3 and 0.5 for nuclear and surface electron recoils, respectively. The data set,\nnormalised to 1 kg*day, are: (line) 1.8 kg*day exposure for a 70 g detector in the 1997 configuration; (dashed) 2.0\nkg*day exposure for a 70 g detector in the 2000 configuration and (hatched histogram) 3.1 kg*day exposure in the\ncenter fiducial region of a 320 g detector with guard ring.\n\nal.3,4 . A first motivation for the development of cryogenic detectors lies in the possibility to\nlower the energy threshold compared to classical detectors 5 . A second motivation comes from\nthe fact that present experiments appear to be mostly limited by the radioactive background\nrate of the detectors 6,7,8 and by the systematic uncertainties of the rejection scheme using pulse\nshape discrimination (PSD) techniques in NaI crystals 8,9 . The simultaneous measurement of\nthe charge and phonon signals using cryogenic detectors 10 , or light and phonon signals 5,11 allows a much more reliable discrimination between the main source of radioactive background,\nproducing electron recoils, and the nuclear recoils expected from WIMP interactions. The discrimination performances of the first 70 g EDELWEISS detectors have been analyzed in Di\nStefano et al.12 and the limitations brought by surface electron or nuclear interactions have been\ndiscussed in Benoit et al.13 . In the following, we discuss the effective rejection factor obtained\nwith a new 320g bolometer with guard ring and aluminum electrodes.\n2\n\nThe 320g bolometer\n\nThis 320 g germanium bolometer has been described in Navick et al.4 . It is equipped with\naluminum electrodes, used as a possible solution to reduce charge collection problems in surface\nevents with respect to implanted electrodes. This detector benefits from a guard ring identifying\nsignals occurring near the edges of the detector. At present, two 320g Ge bolometers have been\ntested. The complete set of three 320 g bolometers should be installed at the end of the present\nrun.\nOn the lower 320 g Ge detector, both central and guard ring electrodes are polarized at\n6.3 volts. A linear cross-talk between the two channels (around 10 percent) has been observed,\nbut this relatively limited effect can be accounted for by the simultaneous analysis of signals\nrecorded on both electrodes. A fiducial volume, estimated to 50 percent of the detector volume\nfrom neutron calibrations, is defined by selecting events with notable amplitude on the central\nelectrode only. The temperature increase due to an interaction is measured through a DCpolarised NTD germanium sensor, with a resistance around 4M\u03a9. The temperature is stabilized\nwithin 10\u03bcK around 27 mK. The ionization channel resolutions are 2 keV FWHM baseline\nand 3keV @ 122keV for the central zone, with a threshold of \u22486 keV e.e., mostly limited by\n\n\fIonization/Recoil Ratio\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n00\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\nRecoil Energy (keV)\n\nFigure 2:\n\nScatter diagram of the quenching factor vs. recoil energy for the fiducial region of the 320g detector\nwith guard ring (3.1kg*day exposure). No events are observed over the \u00b12\u03c3 recoil zone\n\nmicrophonics, and 1.5 keV baseline and 2keV @ 122keV for the guard ring, with a threshold of\n\u22485 keV e.e. The heat channel exhibits a resolution of 1.5 keV baseline and 3keV @ 122keV. The\nraw data trigger rate, prior to software analysis, is of the order of a few events per minute.\n3\n\nPreliminary results\n\nWe present here the preliminary results obtained in a physics data taking of 6.3 kg \u00d7 day, and\na fiducial volume exposure of 3.1 kg \u00d7 day. A comparison of the performances of the present\n320g detectors with the previous 70g detectors has been represented in Fig.1. In this figure, the\nhistogram of the ionization amplitude/recoil energy ratio (the quenching factor), normalized to\n1 for electron recoils, has been plotted. It can readily be seen that the performance increase is\nimportant. In particular, by restricting the data to the central region only, no events are observed\nin the [30, 100] keV recoil energy interval over the 2\u03c3 recoil zone (Fig.2), which corresponds to a\nnuclear recoil acceptance of \u2248 0.95 for the central part of the detector. A paraffin shield of 30cm\nsurrounding the cryostat has been used to reduce the fast neutron flux from the environment\nby more than two orders of magnitude.\nA conservative exclusion contour in the WIMP mass vs. cross-section scatter diagram has\nbeen derived from these data, and is plotted in Fig. 3. It can be seen that the upper part of the\nregion associated with the DAMA region7 is excluded. From the absence of any recorded event\nin the [30, 100] keV recoil energy, a significant sensitivity increase over the next few months can\nreasonably be expected. It is important to note that this limit is obtained without any neutron\nbackground subtraction.\n4\n\nPerspectives and conclusion\n\nWith an effective mass of 160 gram, \u2248 600 times smaller than the DAMA detector, and with an\nexposure \u2248 10 000 times smaller, the present detector already reaches the DAMA region 7 . In a\nforthcoming run, we will install three 320 g Ge detectors similar to the present one. Data taking\nrealized during the present 1 kg stage are expected to last until the end of 2001 and should reach\nthe sensitivity required by the most favorable SUSY models. Improvements should also allow to\nlower the energy threshold by a factor \u2248 2. To explore more deeply the parameter space of SUSY\nmodels, it is clear, from the absence of any candidate event after \u2248 6 weeks of data taking, that a\n\n\f\u03c3(Wimp-proton) (pb)\n\nTeO2\n\n10\n\n-3\nEdelweiss 97\n\n10\n10\n10\n10\n\nGe diodes\n\n-4\nEdelweiss 2000\npreliminary\n\n-5\n\n-6\n\nCDMS,\nwith neutron\nsubtraction\n\nDAMA-NaI\n\nMSSM\n\n-7\n\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n210\n\n4\n\nMW (GeV/c )\n\nFigure 3: Scalar coupling WIMP-nucleon cross-section upper limits obtained by the EDELWEISS experiment\nand compared to the main direct detection experiments. The regions above the curves are excluded at 90% CL.\nAlso represented are the allowed MSSM models compatible with accelerator data, the region selected by the\nDAMA experiment, and the sensitivities of some of the main direct detection experiments.\n\nlarger number of detectors will be required. Therefore, we are actively preparing a second stage\nof the experiment, EDELWEISS-II, which will use a 100-liter dilution fridge of novel geometry\nand presently built in CRTBT Grenoble. This large cryostat, able to accommodate 100 detectors\nand their electronics, is expected to be installed in the Frejus Underground Laboratory in 2002.\nThis second stage is expected to provide an increase in sensitivity by more than two orders of\nmagnitude over the best present performances.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank the technical staff of the LSM and of the participating laboratories for their invaluable help.
