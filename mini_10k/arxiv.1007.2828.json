Using the epoch-folding method, we successfully detected a pulsed period of\n407.69(2) sec in the outburst of January and of 407.26(1) sec after the flare detection\nin March. We find that the spectral detection for the source during outburst can be\ndescribed by a blackbody model with a high temperature (kT \u223c 1 \u2212 3 keV) and a\nsmall radius (R \u223c 1 km), indicating that the emission results from the polar cap of the\nneutron star. On the other hand, the spectra obtained after the outburst can further\nbe described by adding an additional component with a lower temperature (kT \u223c\n0.1 \u2212 0.2 keV) and a larger emission radius (R \u223c 10 \u2212 500 km), which indicates the\nemission from around the inner region of an accretion disk. We find that the thermal\nemission from the hot spot of the accreting neutron star dominates the radiation\nin outburst; the existence of both this X-ray contribution and the additional soft\ncomponent suggest that the polar cap and the accretion disk emission might co-exist\nafter the outburst. Because the two-blackbody signature at the flaring stage is a unique\nfeature of 1A 1118\u2013615, our spectral results may provide a new insight to interpret\nthe X-ray emission for the accreting neutron star. The time separation between the\nthree main outbursts of this system is \u223c 17 years and it might be related to the\norbital period. We derive and discuss the associated physical properties by assuming\nthe elongated orbit for this specific Be/X-ray transient.\nKey words: X-rays: binaries - accretion, accretion discs - stars: emission-line, Be\n- stars: neutron - pulsars: individual (1A 1118\u2013615)\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe transient X-ray source 1A 1118\u2013615 was first discovered by Ariel V in outburst during an observation (1974\nDecember to 1975 January) of Cen X-3 (Eyles et al. 1975).\nA pulsation of 405.3(6) sec was also detected by Ives et al.\n(1975) during this observation but it was wrongly attributed\nto an orbital period with an assumption that 1A 1118\u2013\n615 consists of two massive compact objects. The optical\ncounterpart was identified as the Be star He 3-640/WRA\n793 (Chevalier & Ilovaisky 1975) and is classified as an\nO9.5 III\u2013Ve massive star with a distance of 5 \u00b1 2 kpc\n(Janot-Pacheco et al. 1981). Long-term and short timescale\nvariability in the Balmer emissions of 1A 1118\u2013615 has been\nreported by Motch et al. (1988) and Polcaro et al. (1993),\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: lupin@crab0.astr.nthu.edu.tw\n\nrespectively . This source is also the most extreme Be/X-ray\ntransient system known in terms of the strength of its H\u03b1\nemission (Coe et al. 1994). Polcaro et al. (1993) also identified a number of other lines (FeII , HeI and II , SiII , CIII ,\nNIII and a tentative identification of CrI ); this indicates\nthat 1A 1118\u2013615 has an extremely unusual Be-type primary with complex emission and absorption features.\nThe orbital period of 1A 1118\u2013615 is not well studied.\nAlthough the X-ray flux of the source is variable, it remains\nin the quiescent state for most of the time. The Be/X-ray\nbinary system underwent a flaring state detected by the\nBurst and Transient Source Experiment (BASTE) on board\nthe Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory (CGRO) (Coe et al.\n1994) and the WATCH experiment on board the GRANAT\nsatellite (Lund et al. 1992) in the late January of 1992. More\nrecently, 1A 1118\u2013615 showed an outburst that triggered the\nBurst Alert Telescope of Swift (Swift/BAT) on 2009 Jan-\n\n\fa\n\nExposures (s)\n(PC/WT)\n\nPulsed counts\n(WT)\n\nTotal countsa\n(PC/WT)\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\n2009\n2009\n2009\n2009\n2009\n\nJan04\nJan04\nJan04\nJan06\nJan07\n\n:\n:\n:\n:\n:\n\n03:36\n10:05\n13:21\n12:07\n10:18\n\n105/549\n-/314\n5729/12818\n2595/1041\n462/2746\n\n351\n209\n18697\n249\n3186\n\n-/3865\n-/2061\n5729/127740\n1969/5950\n-/35340\n\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n2009\n2009\n2009\n2009\n2009\n\nMar04\nMar08\nMar08\nMar14\nMar14\n\n:\n:\n:\n:\n:\n\n22:16\n04:47\n15:51\n00:39\n16:24\n\n75/4270\n-/5221\n-/3275\n-/5627\n-/4109\n\n1605\n4593\n2074\n1506\n971\n\n-/9817\n-/24195\n-/13775\n-/7249\n-/5177\n\nOnly the photons observed within 0.3\u201310 keV were counted.\n\nuary 4 (Mangano et al. 2009). Initial X-ray data analysis\nwas done by Kong (2009) and Mangano (2009). 1A 1118\u2013\n615 was detected flaring again during February and March of\n2009 by both the Joint European X-ray Telescope (JEM-X)\nand the soft gamma-ray imager (ISGRI) instruments on the\nInternational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL) (Leyder et al. 2009). The X-Ray Telescope of Swift\n(Swift/XRT) also made follow-up observations after the flaring in March. We here report the Swift observations of 1A\n1118\u2013615 in January and March of 2009.\n\n2\n\nOBSERVATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS\n\nWe analyzed the X-ray data observed by Swift/XRT. These\ndata were mainly observed within two time intervals. From\n2009 January 4, the Be/X-ray transient was monitored by\nSwift/XRT for 4 days with a total exposure of 26 ks, which\nincludes 17 ks in the Windowed Timing (WT) mode and\n9 ks in the Photon Counting (PC) mode during the outburst. INTEGRAL detected flares of 1A 1118\u2013615 again\nfrom 2009 February 3 to March 3 for a total exposure of\n270 ks. The same field was extensively observed by INTEGRAL and Swift over the following days, and our analyses\nfocus on the observations made over an 11 day period with\nSwift/XRT from 2009 March 4 with a total exposure of 22.6\nks (22.5 ks in the WT mode and only 75 s in the PC mode).\nDetails of the observations are listed in Table 1.\nAll the Swift/XRT data were processed with standard\nprocedures (xrtpipeline v.0.12.0), filtering, and screening criteria by using FTOOLS (v.6.5) in the HEAsoft package\n(v.6.5.1). We obtained a refined X-ray position of the source\nby the task \"xrtcentroid\" from the image of ObsID 1 (Table 1) investigated with the PC mode. The source located\nat (J2000) R.A.=11h 20m 57s .8, decl.=\u221261\u25e6 54\u2032 57\u2032\u2032 .9 with an\nuncertainty of 3\u2032\u2032 .9 (90% confidence level) is the only bright\nX-ray object in the field (Kong 2009), and the source in all\nthe other PC images follow this position well. We extracted\nthe source counts from a circular region within a radius of\n47\u2032\u2032 (20 pixels) which is consistent with the 92% of the encircle energy function. The background is obtained from a\nsource-free neighborhood of our target with the same extraction size.\n2.1\n\nTiming Analysis\n\nThe Swift/XRT observations listed in Table 1 were performed with the PC and WT modes.

The lower\none shows the pulsation of 407.26(1) s after the flare detection in\nMarch with a pulsed luminosity of 1.6 \u00d7 1035 ergs/s. The distance\nof the source is assumed to be 4 kpc (Coe & Payne 1985).\n\nmode retain full imaging and spectroscopic resolution but\nthe time resolution is limited to 2.5 s. The data of the WT\nmode only cover the central 8\u2032 of the field of view and one\ndimensional imaging is preserved with a better time resolution of 1.7 ms. The observations we used for analysis\nwere divided into two groups (January and March) to get\nmore counts for accurate temporal analysis. We also applied solar system barycentric time correction with the task\n\"hdaxbary\" using JPL DE200 solar system ephemeris. We\nrestricted the data in the effective energy range (0.3\u201310 keV)\nof Swift/XRT and performed epoch-folding with the period\ncentered at 405.3 sec (Nagase 1989; Ives et al. 1975) using\nthe resolution of 0.1 sec with 200 trials in the close neighborhood (\u223c 395\u2013415 sec). After getting the possible signal\naround 407.0 sec, we then checked the period with more\ndelicate resolution (0.01 sec) in the range of \u00b11.0 sec (406\u2013\n408 sec). The light curve was folded with 32 bins and the\nepoch zero (54835.16972 MJD) was defined at the start of\nthe good time interval (GTI) from the ObsID 1. The most\npossible period in our detections is 407.69(2) sec at epoch\n54837.01125 MJD with \u03c72\u03bd = 152.0 for 31 dof and 407.26(1)\nsec at epoch 54899.95535 MJD with \u03c72\u03bd = 52.6 for 31 dof.\n(The reference epoch was determined by the mid-point of\nthe whole time span.) The corresponding random probabilities of these two periods are close to 0. The uncertainty level\nof the period was determined from the \u03c72 value using eq. 1\nby Leahy (1987)\n\u03c3P\n= 0.71(\u03c72\u03bd \u2212 1)\u22120.63\n\u2206P\n\n(1)\n\nP2\nwhere \u2206P =\nis the inferred Fourier spacing and \u03bd is the\nT\ndegree of freedom. We show the associated pulse profiles in\nFig. 1. We note that the normalized strength of the interpulse around phase 0.2 comparing to the main pulse around\nphase 0.5 increased significantly but the third peak around\nphase 0.8 appears to vanish entirely from January to March.\n\n\fSwift Observations of the Be/X-ray Transient System1A 1118\u2013615\n\n3\n\nTable 2.

In order to avoid the pronounced depression of counts in the center of our target, we therefore directly downloaded the spectral products of PC\nmode observations from the UK Swift Science Data Centre\n(www.swift.ac.uk/user objects/). The WT mode observations were obtained from the High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center and proceeded to the spectral\nanalysis with the standard data reduction. We downloaded\nthe response matrices (rmf) from the official Swift website.\nThe ancillary files (arf) are generated by the task \"xrtmkarf\"\nwith the Swift/XRT CALDB. Because of a strong absorption\nfeature around 0.5 keV, which is associated with the Oxygen edge (Cusumano & The Xrt Calibration Team 2006),\nwe only fitted our spectra in the 0.5\u201310 keV band using\nXSPEC 12.5.1 and rebinned the data with a minimum of\n50 counts per bin to ensure \u03c72 statistics. We produced a\nphase-averaged spectrum for each PC and WT observation\nwith enough exposures to generate more than 30 degrees of\nfreedom in statistics for spectral fit. Among all the investigations, we applied a single power-law model to represent the\nmain non-thermal emission of the accretion column/ outer\ngap (Table 2 & Table 4) and a single blackbody model to\nindicate the thermal emission contributed by the hot spot\n\nof the neutron star (Table 3 & Table 4). If the \u03c72\u03bd of the\nresult is larger than 1, an additional component is required\nto improve the fit. An additional blackbody feature was also\nincluded in the composite model when we take the thermal\nsurface emission of the neutron star (Table 2) or from the\naccretion disk (Table 3) into the consideration. The best-fit\nspectral parameters of different models are all given with\nthe errors at 90% confidence level.\nFor all observations, a single power-law model can not\nprovide a reasonable fit as demonstrated in Table 2 (except for the observation of January 06). On the other\nhand, a single blackbody model can provide an acceptable fit (Table 3 & (a) of Fig. 2) for the data observed\nin January when we took account the systematic uncertainties caused by calibrations (Fig. 3). The spectra with\nlong exposures seem to have worse statistics than those with\nshort exposures. This might be caused by the complicated\nabsorption features associated with the response matrices\n(Cusumano & The Xrt Calibration Team 2006). A composite model with both power-law and blackbody can be fitted\nwith the extracted spectra in March; however, the photon\nindex (\u0393 \u223c 7.5\u22129) is too soft compared with other X-ray binary pulsars (XBPs) and the inferred luminosity in the range\n0.3\u201310 keV will exceed the Eddington luminosity. A composite model can also fit most of the spectra in January, but\nthe associated photon index of the power-law component is\nstill too soft and the main contribution is dominated by the\nblackbody component. We therefore ignore the contribution\n\n\fL. C.-C. Lin, J. Takata, A. K. H. Kong and C. Y. Hwang\n\n4\n\nTable 3. Best\u2013fit spectral parameters for the thermal spectroscopy of 1A 1118\u2013615.

Spectral fits to blackbody models for 3 spectra observed in January and one spectrum observed in March. The January spectra\nare fitted to a single blackbody component; the March one is fitted to two blackbody components. All of these data have relatively long\nexposures than the other observations and the statistical results of these spectral fits are poor. Some strong absorbed features (e.g. 1.5\nkeV of Aluminum, 1.8 keV of Silicon et al.) caused by the uncertainty of the calibrations are clearly visible (the Oxygen edge at 0.5 keV\nhad already been removed before performing the spectral analysis). There is also the strong instrumental Nickel contamination present\nin the high energy edge which sometimes is not fully subtracted. If all of these effects can be completely removed, the results of these\nfits will have significant improvements.\n\nfrom the power-law for all the spectra and only considered\na single/composite model with the blackbody component(s)\nto explain the spectral behavior.\nTwo-blackbody components can improve the spectral\nfit during the outburst. For ObsID 3 and 5 in WT mode,\nan F-test shows that the additional soft component during\nthe outburst is significant at > 99%. But for the other 3\nobservations in January, an additional soft blackbody component does not improve the fits significantly. In contrary,\nfor the observations detected after the flaring in March, a\ntwo-blackbody model fits significantly better than a single\nblackbody one in Table 3 ((b) of Fig. 2). However, we note\nthe WT spectra in ObsID 1, 2 & 4 can be described by an\nacceptable single blackbody model with much shorter exposures than the other observations. It is unclear whether\nthe single blackbody fits might be due to the larger statistical uncertainty in shorter exposures. However, the single\nblackbody component fits with long exposures in January\nare still much better than the single blackbody component\nfits of March observations. This indicates the variation of\nthe spectral behavior might be real.\n\nWe also note that the fitting parameters of Jan 04 observations (ObsID 1 & 2) are very different. This might be\ncaused by the fact that the fitting parameter of the hydrogen absorption is very sensitive to the soft band spectrum\nif the the photon counts are low; a very small variation of\nthe spectrum at soft band will result in a complete different\nhydrogen absorption, which will then cause a large variation\nin other fitting parameters. For the spectra of Jan 04 observations (ObsID 1 & 2), if we fixed the hydrogen absorption\nto be \u223c 6.4 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 , the ObsID 1& 2 of the WT mode\nobservations can both be fitted by a single blackbody model\nwith kT = 1.86\u00b10.07 keV, R =1.11\u00b10.05 km with \u03c72\u03bd = 1.21\nwith 69 d.o.f and kT = 2.16+0.16\n\u22120.13 keV, R =0.89 \u00b1 0.07 km\nwith \u03c72\u03bd = 0.95 with 37 d.o.f. The variations of the parameters between these two spectra with the fixed hydrogen absorption are much smaller than those listed in the Table 3.\nThis indicates that the huge variations of the polar cap temperatures and radius within the same day may not be real.\nFor all the spectra extracted in March, only the second\nspectrum of March 14 (ObsID 10) does not provide an acceptable fit with a two-blackbody model; this might be due\n\n\f6\n\nL.

We divided each observation into pulsed and unpulsed emission depending on their\npulsed phase shown in Fig. 1. The light curve of 1A 1118\u2013\n615 was folded with 32 bins and we assign the phase from\n0.375 to 0.90625 (12th \u2013 29th of 32 bins) to be the pulsed\nphase of the 407.69 s period and the phase from 0.125 to\n0.75 (4th \u2013 24th of 32 bins) to be the pulsed phase of the\n407.26 s one. We also used the same criterion to estimate\nall the pulsed photons in 0.3\u201310 keV for each data listed in\nTable 1. To get enough counts for pulsed spectral fits, all the\npulsed spectra in January and March were combined into a\nJanuary spectrum and March one respectively. The associated ancillary response files were also combined with weightings depending on the relative exposures (shown in Table 1).\nThe pulsed spectrum was then obtained by subtracting the\nunpulsed emission from the pulsed emission. According to\nTable 3, the average hydrogen absorption in the best fit to\na single blackbody spectrum obtained at the outburst stage\nin January is \u223c 6.4 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 and is \u223c 1.9 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122\nto a two blackbody spectrum after the flare detection in\nMarch. In the fits to the pulsed spectra, we fixed these values to associate with the pulsed-average spectra (Table 4).\nThe difference of the absorption can be caused by the possibility that the absorber is related to the different amounts\nand/or the viewing angle of the material accreted by the\npulsar along the line-of-sight.\nThe pulsed spectra of January and March can not be\nwell fitted by a single power-law, and we can not find any evidence of the non-thermal emission from each phase-averaged\nspectrum. However, a single blackbody model can be applied to the pulsed spectra in January and March at 0.5\u2013\n10 keV with kTBB = 1.78+0.10\n\u22120.09 keV, RBB = 0.70 \u00b1 0.05 km\n\nwith \u03c72\u03bd = 0.76 for 314 d.o.f and kTBB = 1.16 \u00b1 0.07 keV,\n2\nRBB = 0.84+0.09\n\u22120.08 km with \u03c7\u03bd = 0.74 for 156 d.o.f. The inferred pulsed flux is (2.8 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10\u221210 ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 in\nJanuary and (8.3 \u00b1 2.6) \u00d7 10\u221211 ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 in March.\nThe decrease of the luminosity might be caused by the cooling of the surface temperature.\n\n3\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nAccording to Ariel V (Eyles et al. 1975), CGRO/BATSE\n(Coe et al. 1994) and Swift/BAT observations, the time separation of \u223c 17 years between the detection of each outburst\nfor 1A 1118\u2013615 suggests that the neutron star does not interact violently with the massive companion during most of\nthe orbit (Villada et al. 1999). If the outburst is only caused\nby the approaching of the neutron star to the periastron, the\nlong time separations of the outbursts indicate a very flat\nelliptical orbit.\nHowever, the orbital periods for known Be/XBPs range\nfrom several days (A 0538\u201366; Johnston et al. 1980) to hundred of days (X1145\u2013619; Watson et al. 1981) and no other\nconvincing evidence can connect this long time separation\nto be the orbital period of 1A 1118\u2013615. The time separation of \u223c 1 month between the outburst of 2009 January\ndetected by Swift/XRT and the flare of 2009 February detected by INTEGRAL might also indicate a possible orbital\nperiod. One major concern is that we would expect to have\nobserved much more flares during the interval of 17 years\nor at least more than one flares after the main outburst if\nthe orbital period was only around 1 month. In addition,\neach main outburst detected every 17 years is the normal\noutbursts (type I, 1036 \u2013 1037 erg/s). However, we would expect to observe a giant burst for a long recurrence interval\n(type II, > 1037 erg/s; Caballero et al. 2008). On the other\nhand, if the orbital period for 1A 1118\u2013615 is 17 years, this\nbinary system will have the longest orbital period than all\nthe other known Be/XBPs shown by Corbet et al. (2009).\nWe would expect to observe some evidences of the passage of the neutron star during the periastron in other wave\nbands. Coe et al. (1994) found that the equivalent width of\nH\u03b1 varied on very short time scales around the outburst\nof 1992; this can be explained as the disruption of the circumstellar disk caused by the passage of the neutron star\nduring the periastron. This indicates that the assumption of\nthe 17-year orbital period is consistent with the H\u03b1 equivalent width variation. Further optical investigations and the\nstudy of high-energy emission mechanism of this Be/X-ray\ntransient may help us to verify the orbital period and solve\nthe related mystery.\n3.1\n\nObservational features detected by Swift\n\nThe pulsation in January was measured during the outburst\nwhile in March it was detected after the flare detection of\nFebruary. The pulsations of 1A 1118\u2013615, shown in Fig. 1,\nobviously demonstrate that the pulsar has spun-up during\nthe period between the outburst and flare events. The pulse\nperiods do not show variation during the different observations of January and March respectively. As a result it is\nunclear whether the outburst or flare is responsible for the\nspinning-up of the pulsar. But the change of the pulse profile\n\n\fSwift Observations of the Be/X-ray Transient System1A 1118\u2013615\nfor 1A 1118\u2013615 may relate to the decrease of the pulsed luminosity; similar luminosity dependencies were also claimed\nfor Cen X-3 (Nagase et al. 1992), LMC X-4 (Levine et al.\n1991) and EXO 2030+375 (Parmar et al. 1989). In the evolution of the pulse profile for EXO 2030+375 following the\nfirst outburst decay, an interpulse appeared and became\nstronger as the luminosity decreased from the maximum and\nthis trend continued until the main pulse had become entirely disappeared. Then the profile became dominated by\nthe contribution from the interpulse. The same luminosity\ndependence was also evident for 1A 1118\u2013615. The pulse\nprofiles of 1A 1118\u2013615 show features similar to those of\nEXO 2030+375 (Parmar et al. 1989); the pulsed luminosity decreased and the normalized strength of the interpulse\nbecame significant relative to the main pulse after the flaring. A long term survey is needed to further examine the\ndependence of the pulse profile and X-ray luminosity.\nAccording to Table 3, a single blackbody model can provide an acceptable fit with a temperature of kT > 1 keV and\na small hot spot radius (\u223c 1 km; assuming a source distance\nof 4 kpc; Coe & Payne 1985) for most of the data observed in\nthe outburst. The thermal emission can be attributed to the\nionized photons or the collision of the heated gas; however,\nthe most plausible origin is from the surface (polar cap)\nemission of the neutron star (La Palombara & Mereghetti\n2007; La Palombara et al. 2009). Hickox et al. (2004) presented a clear physical picture to show the emitting process\nduring the accretion. In this picture, the radius of the accreting polar cap is \u223c 0.1RNS , where RNS is the radius of\nthe neutron star, typically assumed to be 10 km. In contrary\nto the spectra of most XBPs (Hickox et al. 2004), we did not\nfind any obvious evidence of a main non-thermal contribution. Instead of X-rays emitted from the accretion column\nor outer gap, we detected strong emission from a surface\nlayer. This X-ray contribution during the outburst can be\noriginated from the thermal emission around the compact\nsource, which is similar to the polar cap emission of an isolated neutron star.\nThe second thermal feature (R > 100 km & kT <\n0.2 keV) resembles the X-rays from the inner edge of an accretion disk (Hickox et al. 2004). This additional soft characteristic may become an important component when the\npulsed flux of the source weakens. Such X-ray thermal contributions are always observed in the bright XBPs with luminosity > 1037\u221238 ergs/s (Paul et al. 2002; Ramsay et al.\n2002; Manousakis et al. 2009), but the source luminosity of\n1A 1118\u2013615 in 0.5 \u2013 10 keV observed by Swift/XRT is only\n\u223c (0.6 \u2212 1.7) \u00d7 1036 ergs s\u22121 . Our results might indicate\nthat the soft excess contributed by the emission from the\ninner disk can generally be observed for the XBPs after flaring, not only for the bright targets. If the variation of the\nsecond thermal component is real, our spectral analyses in\ndifferent time intervals may indicate that the surface (polar\ncap) emission of the neutron star dominates the observed\nX-rays from 1A 1118\u2013615 at the beginning of outburst. The\nfact that the thermal emission contributed by the accretion disk becomes significant at another specific time interval may represent that a different violent radiation process\nstarts in one month and may be also associated with the\nflare detection. Although the average source luminosity in\ndifferent time intervals only changes by a small fraction, the\ncooling of temperature in the similar polar cap area clearly\n\n7\n\nexhibit a decay of the surface emission from the neutron\nstar. The decrease of the pulsed emission derived from our\nphase-resolved spectrum also supports this viewpoint.\n\n3.2\n\nParameters of the binary system\n\nThe parameters of the neutron star and the properties of the\norbital motion for the binary system, 1A 1118\u2013615, are not\nwell understood. Furthermore, the possible orbital period of\n\u223c 17 yr is extremely large compared with 100 days for the\ntypical Be/XBPs with long spin period. Therefore, it will\nbe worth examining the parameters of the neutron star and\norbital motion for further discussion on this unique highmass X-ray binary system.\nThe increasing X-ray emission at the outburst stage\nin January of 2009 allowed us to find a rotation period of\nP \u223c 407.69(2) sec. On the other hand, a rotation period\nof P \u223c 409.2(8) sec was reported by Chandra observation\non August 21 of 2003 in the quiescence stage of the source\n(Rutledge et al. 2007). Assuming that this spin up of the\nneutron star from its quiescence stage is a result of a continuous accretion of matter onto the stellar surface of the neutron star, we can estimate the accretion rate and the magnetic field of the neutron star. The Chandra observation in\n2003 detected an X-ray luminosity of LX \u223c 1.8 \u00d7 1034 erg/s\nin the 0.5-10 keV energy bands. Assuming the X-ray emission is from the accretion onto the stellar surface, the accretion rate at the surface is estimated as (Campana et al.\n1998)\n\u1e40acc\n\n=\n\u223c\n\nRNS\n\u03b7BC LX\nGMNS\n\u22121\n5 \u00d7 1013 \u03b7BC M1.4\nR6 LX,34 g/s\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b7BC is the bolometric correction, RNS and MNS are\nstellar radius of and the mass of the neutron star, respectively. In addition, LX,34 is the X-ray luminosity in units of\n1034 erg/s, and R6 is the stellar radius of the neutron star\nin units of 106 cm and M1.4 is the mass of the neutron star\nin units of the solar mass.\nWe assume that the accretion rate is constant in the quiescent stage before the onset of the outburst in 2009 January.\nCombining the estimated accretion rate \u1e40acc with conservation of the angular momentum that\n\u221a\nI\u03b4\u03a9/\u03b4t = \u1e40acc GMNS Rm\n(3)\nwith Rm being the magnetospheric radius where the magnetic pressure is balanced with the pressure of the accretion\ndisk, the strength of the magnetic field of the neutron star\nis given by\n3/2\n\n\u22123\nB \u223c 2 \u00d7 1014 \u03b7BC\nM1.4 R6\u22126 L\u22123\nX,34 G\n\n(4)\n45\n\nwhere we used the momentum of inertia of I = 10 g * cm3 .\nThe strength of the magnetic field can be estimated as\nB \u223c 2 \u00d7 1014 G for M1.4 = 1 and R = 106 cm. This\nvalue is also similar to those extremely magnetized neutron\nstars (known as magnetar, Woods & Thompson 2006) if the\nbolometric correction is \u03b7BC \u223c 1. On the other hand, a\ntypical strength of the magnetic field of a young neutron\nstar B \u223c 1012 G is expected if \u03b7BC \u223c 5. Accretion onto\nthe neutron star surface is permitted when the magnetospheric radius Rm becomes smaller than the corotation ra-\n\n\f8\n\nL. C.-C. Lin, J. Takata, A. K. H. Kong and C. Y. Hwang\n\ndius, Rcor = (GMNS P 2 /4\u03c0 2 )1/3 , where P is the period of\nthe neutron star. This condition is satisfied when \u03b7BC > 2.\nIt will be expected that the outburst occurs as a result\nof the interaction between the equatorial disk of the Be star\nand the neutron star at the periastron passage. Near the\nperiastron, the velocity of the neutron star, vNS , will become vNS . (GMBe /RBe )1/2 (\u223c 500 km/s), where we used\nstellar mass and radius of Be star of MBe = 17M\u2299 and\nRBe = 10R\u2299 , respectively (Sigut et al. 2009). This implies\nthat the velocity of the neutron star is in general larger than\nthe typical velocity for the matter of the equatorial disk of\nthe Be star, whose typical initial velocity is << 1 km/s\n(Marlborough et al. 1997; Porter 1998). The velocity of the\nneutron star dominates that of the matter of the equatorial\ndisk of the Be star near the periastron. Then the capture of\nthe matter from the equatorial disk of the Be star by the\nneutron star will occur at a radius of\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u22122\nMNS\nvNS\nracc \u223c 2GMNS /vr2 \u223c 3.8\u00d71011\ncm\n1.4M\u2299\n100 km/s\n(5)\nfrom the neutron star, where vr \u223c vNS is the velocity of the\nmaterial of the equatorial disk relative to the neutron star.\nAt the outburst stage in January of 2009, the average Xray emission at 0.5\u201310 keV was measured with a luminosity\nof LX \u223c 1.5 \u00d7 1036 erg/s, indicating that the accretion rate\nonto the neutron star is\n\u1e40acc \u223c 6.4 \u00d7 10\u221210\n\n\u03b7BC\nM\u2299 /yr.\n5\n\n(6)\n\nThis accretion rate for a young neutron star is about 2\norders of magnitude smaller than typical mass loss rate\n(\u1e40w \u223c 10\u22127 M\u2299 /yr; Waters et al. 1988) of an equatorial\ndisk around a Be star. We can also estimate the accreting\ndensity of the surrounding medium from Bondi accretion\n2\n(M \u0307acc = 4\u03c0racc\n\u03c1vr ; where \u03c1 is the ambient density). Thus\nwe obtain:\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22122 \u0012\n\u0013\nM \u0307acc\nMNS\nvNS\n\u221216\n\u03c1=\n\u223c\n5\u00d710\n\u03b7\n. g/cm3\nBC\n2 v\n4\u03c0racc\n1.4M\u2299\n100 km/s\nr\n(7)\nThis is several orders smaller than the typical value (\u03c1 \u223c\n10\u221210 \u2212 10\u221213 g/cm3 ) of the density at the inner region of\nthe disk (Sigut et al. 2009), implying that (1) the neutron\nstar is likely interacting with the outer edge of the Be star\ndisk or (2) the disk of Be star in 1A 1118\u2013615 is relatively\nthin.\nOur spectral analyses show one thermal polar cap component during the outburst stage in January and show\nan additional thermal disk component after the flaring in\nMarch. This might be explained as a result of the neutron\nstar approaching the equatorial disk of the Be star. When\nthe neutron star first approached the equatorial disk, the accretion disk of the neutron star could have accumulated relatively little material, so the accretion disk would not have\nsignificant emission and we could only detect the polar cap\nemission of the neutron star. The flare of February might be\ncaused by disk instabilities of the accretion disk of the neutron star. This indicates that the neutron star would have\naccreted significant amount of material from the equatorial\ndisk of the Be star during the periastron; this makes the\nthermal disk component visible in the March observations\nafter the February flare.\n\n4\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Be/X-ray transient 1A 1118\u2013615 has been observed in\noutburst by Swift starting in January of 2009. Comparing\nwith the epochs of two previous outbursts for 1A 1118\u2013615\ndetected by Ariel V and CGRO/BATSE, the time separation of \u223c 17 years might give a hint as the orbital period. On\nthe other hand, the time interval of \u223c 1 month between the\ndetection of the outburst and the flaring in 2009 might also\ngive another indication of the orbital period; especially given\nthe fact that the new Be/XBP (e.g. SAX J2103.5+4545;\nBaykal et al. 2000) was discovered to have a rapid orbital\nmotion with a long spin period. We performed timing analysis on the Swift/XRT archive data and the pulsations at\n407.69(2) sec and 407.26(1) sec were individually detected\nin January and March. 1A 1118\u2013615 had obviously spun-up\ndue to the accretion from the massive primary between the\nJanuary and March observations.\nWe also investigated the X-ray spectral behavior during the outburst in January and after another flare detection in March. Almost all the phase-averaged spectra can\nbe well-modeled by thermal emission. During the outburst,\nwe found that a single blackbody component with a higher\ntemperature of \u223c 1 keV and a small radius of R \u223c 1 km provides a reasonable fit, and it indicates that most of the observed X-rays are from the polar cap emission of the compact\nstar. After the flare detected by INTEGRAL, the following\nSwift/XRT observations display a significant soft thermal\nexcess above the main surface emission from the neutron star\nin their spectral behavior. The soft thermal excess shows a\nlower temperature of \u223c 0.1 \u2212 0.2 keV and a larger emitting\nradius of \u223c 100 km; this component might be connected to\nthe emission from the inner accretion disk of the binary system. In contrary to other XBPs, we do not find a significant\nnon-thermal component in the spectrum of 1A 1118\u2013615.\nOur results show that the thermal radiation from the hot\nspot of neutron star and from the reprocessing of the dense\nmaterial in the inner disk provides the emission mechanism\nfor 1A 1118\u2013615 after the outburst. The highest luminosity\nat 0.5\u201310 keV of this source detected after the outburst is\nonly \u223c 2.7 \u00d7 1036 ergs/s. Our results also demonstrate that\nthe soft excess contributed by the inner accretion disk may\nnot only be observed in bright XBPs (Lx & 1037\u221238 ergs/s).\nHickox et al. (2004) gave a clear physical picture to explain the possible origin of the soft excess. Our discoveries\nbased on the spectral analysis may provide a hint to examine the accreting phenomenon. We also derived the physical\nproperties of this accreting system using a simple model. The\naccretion rate and the density of the circumstellar disk derived with the assumption of the elongated orbit of 1A 1118\u2013\n615 are lower than those of the other general Be/XBPs. This\nindicates the neutron star might pass the outer edge of the\nequatorial disk of the Be star.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors appreciate an anonymous referee for his/her\nfruitful comments.
