Already the 19th-century\nfounders of modern geometry contemplated the possibility that a piece of empty\nspace that looks completely smooth and structureless to the naked eye might\nhave an intricate microstructure at a much smaller scale. Our vastly increased\nunderstanding of the physical world acquired during the 20th century has made\nthis a certainty. The laws of quantum theory tell us that looking at spacetime\nat ever smaller scales requires ever larger energies, and, according to Einstein's\ntheory of general relativity, this will alter spacetime itself: it will acquire structure\nin the form of curvature. What we still lack is a definitive theory of quantum\ngravity to give us a detailed and quantitative description of the highly curved\nand quantum-fluctuating geometry of spacetime at this so-called Planck scale. \u2013\nThis article outlines a particular approach to constructing such a theory, that of\nCausal Dynamical Triangulations, and its achievements so far in deriving from\nfirst principles why spacetime is what it is, from the tiniest realms of the quantum\nto the large-scale structure of the universe.\n1\n\n\fSearching for the quanta of spacetime\nArmed with last century's insights into the nature of both quantum theory and\ngeneral relativity, physicists believe that probing the structure of space and time\nat distances far below those currently accessible by our most powerful accelerators\nwould reveal a rich geometric fabric, where spacetime itself never stands still but\ninstead quantum-fluctuates wildly. One of the biggest challenges of theoretical\nphysics today is to identify these fundamental \"atoms\" or excitations of spacetime\ngeometry and understand how their interaction gives rise to the macroscopic\nspacetime we see around us and which serves as a backdrop for all known physical\nphenomena.\nTwo pillars of contemporary physics support the expectation that as we resolve the fabric of spacetime with an imaginary microscope at ever smaller scales,\nspacetime will turn from an immutable stage into the actor itself. First, due to\nHeisenberg's uncertainty relations, probing spacetime at very short distances is\nnecessarily accompanied by large quantum fluctuations in energy and momentum\n- the shorter the distance, the larger the energy-momentum uncertainty. Second,\naccording to Einstein's theory of general relativity, the presence of these energy\nfluctuations, like that of any form of energy, will deform the geometry of the\nspacetime in which it resides, imparting curvature which is detectable through\nthe bending of light rays and particle trajectories. Taking these two things together leads to the prediction that the quantum structure of space and time at\nthe so-called Planck scale must be highly curved and dynamical.\nA long held ambition of theoretical physicists is to find a consistent description of this dynamical microstructure within a theory of quantum gravity, which\nunifies quantum theory and general relativity, and to determine its ramifications\nfor high-energy physics and cosmology. Given the extraordinary smallness of the\nPlanck length, how can we achieve progress in describing a physical situation\nthat cannot be directly probed by experiment in the foreseeable future? The\nway this is usually done is by first postulating additional dynamical principles\nor fundamental symmetries at small distances, which are not accessible to direct\nexperimental verification, second, verifying that these do not conflict with standard quantum physics or general relativity as one goes to larger scales, and third,\npredicting new physical phenomena that can (at least in principle) be tested,\nor confirmed indirectly by astrophysical observations. Examples of fundamental\nbuilding principles are that the universe is made up of tiny vibrating strings,\nor that spacetime at the Planck scale is not a continuum, but consists of tiny\ndiscrete grains.\nResearch into quantum gravity falls broadly into two categories [1, 2]: nonperturbative approaches to quantum gravity, whose primary aim is to quantize\nthe gravitational degrees of freedom per se, introducing little or no additional\n\n2\n\n\fstructure such as supersymmetry or extra dimensions, and string-theoretic approaches, where the quantization of gravity appears almost as a by-product of\na unified higher-dimensional and supersymmetric \"theory of everything\", whose\nfundamental objects are strings and (mem)branes [3, 4].\nThe research program that will be described in this article deals with the\ninvestigation of causal nonperturbative quantum gravity and belongs in the first\ncategory. The approach takes its name from the main technical tool it employs to\ntry and construct a theory of quantum gravity, namely, Causal Dynamical Triangulations, or CDT for short.1 What makes this approach particularly interesting\nis the fact that it has recently produced a number of tangible results which mark\nit as a serious contender for the still elusive theory of quantum gravity [6, 7, 8, 9].\nFirstly, there is evidence that the theory has a good classical limit. This means\nthat it reproduces Einstein's classical theory at sufficiently large scales: when\none \"zooms out\" the imaginary microscope from the scale at which the quantum\nfluctuations take place, one eventually rediscovers the smooth four-dimensional\nspacetime of general relativity. Secondly, we have first indications of what the\nquantum structure of spacetime may be at the Planck scale.\nWe will explain in the following why these results are indeed remarkable and\nhow they were obtained, in a manner hopefully accessible to those outside the\nfield. The emphasis will be on describing the (very few) fundamental building\nprinciples that go into the construction of the theory, on explaining the main\nresults and their physical significance, and on giving an idea of where we are\nheaded. Before doing this, we will in the next section set out by sketching some\nof the problems facing research in quantum gravity, in order to provide the reader\nwith a better idea of how the results described later appear in a larger context.\n\nWhy quantum gravity is special\nQuantum gravity is quite unlike any other fundamental quantum interaction in\nthat it describes the dynamics of an entity that in most physical situations is\nconsidered as fixed and given, namely, that of spacetime itself. Recall that the\ndegrees of freedom of a spacetime in classical general relativity can be described\nby the spacetime metric g\u03bc\u03bd (x), a local field variable which determines the values\nof distance and angle measurements in spacetime, or, equivalently, how spacetime\nis bent and curved locally.2 What spacetime is classically is determined by solving\nthe Einstein equations for g\u03bc\u03bd (x), subject to boundary conditions and a particular\nmatter content of the universe or a piece thereof. In the same manner, in order\n1\n\nPrevious reviews of CDT, describing the general theory and covering earlier results in lower\ndimensions can be found in [5].\n2\nWhen using the term (quantum) spacetime, we will in the following always mean the abstract spacetime (a differential manifold in the classical case) together with its metric properties.\n\n3\n\n\fto determine what spacetime is from a quantum-theoretical point of view, one\nwould like to formulate a quantum analogue of Einstein's equations, from which\n\"quantum spacetime\" should then emerge as a solution.\nThis should be contrasted with usual quantum field theory, which describes\nthe dynamics of elementary particles and their interactions on a fixed spacetime\nbackground, usually that of the flat, four-dimensional Minkowski space of special\nrelativity. Since at short distances3 the gravitational forces are so much weaker\nthan the electromagnetic ones, say, it is usually an excellent approximation to\ntreat the gravitational degrees of freedom as \"frozen in\" and non-dynamical. The\ntrivial geometric structure of the Minkowski metric forms merely part of the immutable background structure of how quantum field theories are formulated. On\nthe other hand, the physical situations that quantum gravity aims to explain\nare not in general describable in terms of linear fluctuations of the metric field\naround Minkowski space or some other fixed background metric. These include\nthe quantitative description of \"empty\" spacetime at very short distances of the\norder of the Planck scale, 10\u221235 m, and of the extreme and ultradense state our\nuniverse presumably was in when it was very young. From a technical point of\nview this implies that in quantum gravity one has to modify standard quantization techniques which rely (sometimes implicitly) on the presence of a fixed\nmetric background structure. This is often phrased by saying that gravity must\nultimately be quantized in a way that is both background-independent (i.e. does\nnot distinguish any particular background metric at the outset) and nonperturbative (i.e. does not simply describe the dynamics of linear perturbations around\nsome fixed background spacetime).\nDecades of quantum gravity research, including numerous trials and errors,\nhave convinced many of the necessity of background-independence and a nonperturbative quantization approach [10], and the last twenty years or so have\nseen intense efforts to develop alternative ways of quantizing applicable to the\ncase of a dynamical spacetime geometry. Because of the complicated mathematical structures involved, this turns out to be very difficult. Singularly unhelpful\nin this endeavour has been the absence of experimental or observational data\nto guide the search for the correct theory of quantum gravity. This happens because the extreme scales that are necessarily involved in physical situations where\nquantum-gravitational effects are important are not accessible directly with current technology. A possible strategy to address this state of affairs is to take a\nrather conservative approach to theory-building, for example, to avoid going out\non a limb by postulating the existence of new physical quantities and symmetries for which there is as yet no evidence. As we will see, the approach of CDT\nis fairly minimalist in that it takes a set of well-known physical principles and\n3\n\nShort, but still far away from the Planck scale defined below.\n\n4\n\n\ftools (quantum-mechanical superposition, causality, triangulation of geometry,\nelements of the theory of critical phenomena) and merely adapts them to the\nsituation of a dynamical geometry.\nHow far then have we got in our quest for a theory of quantum gravity? Maybe\nthe best answer to this question is that it is hard to tell, as long as we do not\nknow the final answer with some certainty. This assessment must in all honesty\nalso include the possibility that we are still very far from the correct theory.\nThere has been a lot of research since the late 1980s, both in nonperturbative\nquantum gravity as such and under the heading of string theory, at the time\nwhen the incorporation of gravitation into our understanding of the quantum\nworld emerged as a final theoretical frontier of fundamental physics. Progress has\nundoubtedly been made, at the very least in terms of developing technical tools\nto describe quantum geometry nonperturbatively (see, for example, [11, 12, 13]).\nHowever, in order to cut a long story short, there is still not a single theory\nof quantum gravity that is both reasonably complete and internally consistent\nmathematically. By reasonably complete we mean that it should provide answers\nto some of quantum gravity's central questions, for instance, \"Why is spacetime\nthe way it is?\", \"What are the fundamental excitations of quantum geometry?\",\n\"What are the quantum properties of black holes?\" etc., even if they are not\nimmediately verifiable experimentally. Our entire discussion therefore must be\nunderstood against a background where we do not have a plethora of \"possible\"\ntheories available (and just look for clues for how to pick the right one), but\nwhere we are still looking for the first instance of a quantum gravity theory that\nis sufficiently complete to make at least some predictions about the quantum\nbehaviour of spacetime.\n\nThe dynamical principle underlying CDT\nThe most important theoretical tool of the CDT method to construct a quantum\ntheory of gravity is Feynman's principle of superposing quantum amplitudes [14],\nthe famous path integral, applied to spacetime geometries. Its basic idea, familiar\nfrom quantum mechanics, is to obtain a solution to the quantum dynamics of a\nphysical system by taking a superposition of \"all possible\" configurations of the\nsystem, where each configuration contributes a complexRweight exp(iS) to the\npath integral, which depends on the classical action S = dtL(t) of the configuration, where L denotes the system's Lagrangian. For the case of a nonrelativistic\nparticle moving in a potential, the configurations are literally paths in space, i.e.\ncontinuous trajectories x(\u03c4 ) describing the particle's position as a function of\ntime \u03c4 , which runs through an interval \u03c4 \u2208 [0, t]. Superposing (that is, adding\nor integrating up) the associated quantum amplitudes exp iS part [x(\u03c4 )] as in eq.\n(1) below, one obtains a solution to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation of the particle.\n5\n\n\fxf\n\n\u03c4f\n\n\u2206\u03c4 =1\n\nxi\n\n\u03c4i\n\nFigure 1: A typical, piecewise straight path x(\u03c4 ) contributing to the regularized Feynman path integral for a non-relativistic particle moving between two points xi and\nxf .\n\nIt is important to realize that the individual paths x(\u03c4 ) appearing in the path\nintegral are not themselves physical trajectories the particle could move on, and\neven less solutions to the particle's classical equations of motion. Instead, they\nare so-called \"virtual\" paths, that is, a bunch of curves one can draw between\nfixed initial and final points xi and xf (Fig. 1). The magic of the path integral\nZ\nX\npart\nG(xi , xf , t) :=\neiS [x(\u03c4 )]\n(1)\npaths: xi \u2192xf\n\nis that the true quantum physics of the particle is encoded precisely in the superposition of all these virtual paths4 . In order to extract these physical properties,\none has to evaluate suitable quantum operators \u00d4 on the ensemble of paths contributing to (1). For example, one may be interested in computing expectation\nvalues for the position or the energy of the particle, together with their quantum\nfluctuations. Of course, the path integral or \"propagator\" (1) also allows us to\nretrieve the classical behaviour of the particle in a particular limit (in this case,\nwhen its mass becomes big), but it contains more information, describing the full\nquantum dynamics of the system.\nAnalogously, a path integral for gravity is a superposition of all virtual \"paths\"\nour universe (or a part thereof) can follow as time unfolds. These paths are simply\n\nR\nIn using the notation \u03a3 in (1), we want to indicate that the path integral may be a sum or a\ngenuine integral (or possibly a combination of both), depending on whether the configurations\ncontributing to it are labelled by discrete or continuous parameters. In CDT we will meet an\nexample of the former.\n4\n\n6\n\n\fthe different configurations for the metric field variables g\u03bc\u03bd (x) mentioned earlier.5\nIt is important to realize that a single path is now no longer an assignment of just\nthree numbers (the coordinates xi of the particle) to every moment \u03c4 in time, but\nrather the assignment to every \u03c4 of a whole array of numbers (the space-space\ncomponents gij (x) \u2261 gij (x, \u03c4 ) of the metric tensor g\u03bc\u03bd (x)) for each spatial point\nx. This is simply a consequence of gravity being a field theory with infinitely\nmany degrees of freedom. The path integral for gravity can thus be written as\nZ\nX\ngrav\nG(gi , gf , t) :=\neiS [g\u03bc\u03bd (x,\u03c4 )] ,\n(2)\nspacetimes: gi \u2192gf\n\nwhere S grav now denotes the classical gravitational action associated with a spacetime metric g\u03bc\u03bd with initial and final boundary condition gi and gf , separated by a\ntime distance t. Like in the particle case, the individual spacetime configurations\ninterpolating between the initial and final spatial geometries have nothing a priori\nto do with classical spacetimes, and are much more general objects. Again, one\nwould expect to be able to retrieve the full quantum dynamics of spacetime from\nthe path integral (2), which is a superposition of all possible ways in which an\nempty spacetime can be curved6 . In other words, the collective behaviour of the\nvirtual spacetimes contributing to the gravitational propagator (2) should tell us\nwhat quantum spacetime is. To extract this geometric information, we will again\nhave to evaluate suitable quantum operators \u00d4 on the ensemble of geometries\ncontributing to (2). Suffice it to say that making the gravitational path integral\nwell-defined and extracting the desired physical information is very much more\ndifficult than in the case of the quantum particle.\nThe way in which CDT proceeds is by giving a precise prescription of how the\npath integral (2) should be computed, and in particular how the class of virtual\npaths should be chosen. In addition, it provides a set of technical tools to extract\nconcrete physical information about the quantum geometry thus created by the\nprinciple of quantum superposition.\nThere are a number of ways in which the path integral of CDT differs from\nthat of previous approaches. In the first instance, it is genuinely nonperturbative,\nin that the contributing geometries can have very large curvature fluctuations\nat very small scales and thus be arbitrarily far away from any classical spacetime. Our summation is \"democratic\" in that no particular spacetime geometry\nis distinguished at the outset. In fact, path integral histories which have any\ngeometric resemblance to a classical spacetime are so rare that their contribu5\n\nWe are considering here only the gravitational degrees of freedom, that is, a path integral\nfor \"pure gravity\", and thus a \"theory for empty space\". Matter fields can in principle be\nincluded without problems.\n6\nThese are also sometimes called \"spacetime histories\".\n\n7\n\n\ftion to the path integral is effectively negligible.7 Secondly, as we will see in the\nfollowing, the causal structure of the geometries contributing to the path sum\nplays an important role in the method of causal dynamical triangulations, and is\na key new element in comparison with previous, so-called Euclidean path-integral\napproaches to quantum gravity.\n\nRepresenting spacetime geometry in CDT\nWhat we need to do next in order to make sense of the expression (2) for the\nnonperturbative quantum-gravitational propagator is to define the precise class\nof spacetime geometries (labelled above by g\u03bc\u03bd ) over which the sum or integral is\nto be taken. As elsewhere in quantum field theory, one is immediately confronted\nwith the fact that unless one chooses a careful regularization for the path integral,\nit will be wildly divergent and simply not exist in any meaningful mathematical\nsense (and thus be useless for extracting physical information). \"Regularizing\"\nmeans making the path integral finite by introducing certain cutoff parameters\nfor the contributing configurations, which at a later stage will be removed in a\ncontrolled manner.\nBefore defining a suitable class of geometries in the next section, we will first\nexplain the nature of the regularized spacetimes used by CDT, which are called\n\"piecewise flat geometries\". Recall that the dynamical degrees of freedom of a\ngeometry are the ways in which it is locally curved. Piecewise flat geometries\nare simply spaces that are flat (the same as straight or uncurved, that is, structureless from a geometric point of view) everywhere apart from small subspaces\nwhere curvature is said to be concentrated. This in a way discretizes curvature\nand vastly reduces the different number of ways spacetime can be curved. The\ntype of geometry we will use is a triangulated space, also sometimes called a\nRegge geometry, after the physicist who first introduced it into (classical) general\nrelativity [16]. It can be thought of as a space glued together from elementary\nbuilding blocks which are (higher-dimensional generalizations of) triangles, socalled \"simplices\". The geometric structure of each simplex is trivial, since it is\nby itself flat by definition and therefore carries no curvature. Local curvature only\nappears along lower-dimensional interfaces when one starts gluing the simplices\ntogether.\nThis can be visualized most easily in the two-dimensional case. Consider a set\nof identical equilateral two-dimensional triangles cut out from a piece of cardboard\n7\n\nThis is completely analogous to the particle case, where it can be shown rigorously that\nclassical paths \"form a set of measure zero\" with respect to the Wiener measure of the path\nintegral [15]. Maybe surprisingly, the paths which contribute non-trivially are nowhere differentiable, and thus \"consist only of corners\". One expects a similarly nonclassical behaviour for\nthe dominant configurations of the gravitational path integral.\n\n8\n\n\fy\n\ny\n\n\u03b4\nx\n\nx\n\n(a)\n\n\u03b4\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 2: Example of positive and negative deficit angles \u03b4 located at a vertex of\na two-dimensional triangulation. The triangulations have been cut open in order to\nflatten them into the two-dimensional Euclidean x-y-plane. To reconstruct the original\ngeometry around the central vertex (which has been placed at the plane's origin), one\nhas to identify the triangle edges as indicated by the arrows. In case (a), the angles\nmeeting at the vertex add up to less than 2\u03c0, resulting in a positively curved space\nupon regluing. In case (b) the combined angle exceeds 2\u03c0, corresponding to a negatively\ncurved space.\n\nwhich is perfectly straight and unbendable (and hence flat). To obtain a larger\nsurface, start gluing these triangles together by identifying their one-dimensional\nsides or edges pairwise. Points where several edges meet are also called vertices.\nOne can obtain a piece of flat space by arranging the triangles in a regular pattern\nso that exactly six triangles and edges meet at each vertex. However, there are\nmany more ways to create curved spaces by the same gluing procedure. Namely,\nwhenever the number of triangles meeting at a vertex is smaller or larger than six,\nthis vertex will carry a positive or negative curvature.8 By \"curvature\" we mean\nthe intrinsic curvature of the two-dimensional surface, i.e. the curvature that can\nbe detected from within the surface \u2013 for example, by studying the trajectories\nof particles or light rays \u2013, and is independent of any higher-dimensional space\nin which it may be imbedded. This mirrors a property of the physical theory of\ngeneral relativity in four dimensions, which likewise depends only on the intrinsic\ngeometry of spacetime. The set-up in higher dimensions is identical, with the\ntwo-dimensional triangles (or \"two-simplices\") substituted by the corresponding\nflat higher-dimensional simplices (three-simplices (or tetrahedra) in dimension 3,\nfour-simplices in dimension 4, etc.). Generally speaking, the fundamental building\nblocks in dimension d are glued together pairwise along their (d\u22121)-dimensional\nfaces, and their intrinsic curvature is concentrated on the (d \u2212 2)-dimensional\n8\n\nEquivalently, one speaks of the vertex having a positive or negative deficit angle, simply\nbecause the sum of the angles of the triangles contributing at the vertex is smaller or bigger\nthan 2\u03c0, whereas in the flat case it is exactly 2\u03c0, see Fig. 2 for illustration.\n\n9\n\n\fintersections of these faces.\nThe so-called Regge calculus [17] was originally designed to approximate\nsmooth classical spacetimes, or, more precisely, solutions to the Einstein equations, by these piecewise flat, triangulated spaces. There are two reasons for\nwhy this is a very economical way of describing a spacetime. Firstly, only a finite\namount of data is necessary to completely characterize a finite piece of spacetime,\nnamely, the geodesic invariant lengths of all the one-dimensional edges of all the\nsimplices involved, and the way in which the d-dimensional simplices are glued\ntogether.9 Secondly, because no coordinate system need ever be introduced on\nthe simplices, this formulation does not share the usual coordinate redundance\nof Einstein gravity described in terms of the field variables g\u03bc\u03bd (x). (The latter\novercount the degrees of freedom, because g\u03bc\u03bd 's which are related by coordinate\ntransformations correspond to one and the same physical geometry.)\nThe use of Regge geometries in the quantum theory is not new, and CDT\nbuilds on previous attempts of both \"Quantum Regge Calculus\" [18] and \"Dynamical Triangulations\" [19] to define a theory of quantum gravity from a nonperturbative Euclidean path integral10 . To avoid misunderstandings, it should be\nemphasized that the use of triangulated spacetimes differs in classical and quantum applications. The objective in the former is to approximate a single, smooth\nspacetime (which may or may not be known exactly by some other method) as\nwell as possible. This can be achieved by choosing a sequence of triangulations,\nwhere in each step of the sequence the triangulation is chosen finer than in the\nprevious step (i.e. the typical edge length is decreased) and therefore can converge\nto the smooth manifold in a pointwise sense. In the two-dimensional example, it\nis quite clear that such an approximation can be very good when the edge lengths\nbecome much smaller than the scale at which the smooth spacetime is curved.\nBy contrast, the objective of the quantum theory, and that of CDT in particular, is to approximate the integral (2) as well as possible, or, more precisely,\nto define it since there is currently no alternative, independent way of doing the\ncomputation. This is a completely different task, since the integral does not represent a single classical geometry, but a quantum superposition, where each single\ncontributing spacetime is a highly nonclassical object, as we pointed out earlier.\nThere is no accurate mathematical statement to guide this construction, but one\nwould expect that the path integral should provide an \"ergodic sampling\" of the\n9\n\nThis can be kept track of by attaching labels to all simplices and their faces, say, and then\npairing off the faces which are glued together.\n10\nThe essential difference between the two approaches is that in Quantum Regge Calculus one\nfixes a triangulation or \"gluing\", so that the path integral takes the form of a (multiple) integral\nover the lengths of the edges of that triangulation, whereas in Dynamical Triangulations one\nfixes all edge lengths to a common value a, in which case the path integral takes the form of a\ndiscrete sum over all inequivalent ways to glue the (then identical-looking) simplicial building\nblocks together.\n\n10\n\n\fspace of geometries. This may seem like a very vague characterization, but one is\nin practice very much constrained by the requirement of making the regularized\npath integral mathematically well-defined and obtaining a sensible classical limit.\nThe short-distance cutoff a is an important part of our regularization of the\nspacetime geometries in the gravitational propagator. We will take the limit\na \u2192 0 as part of the search for a so-called continuum limit of the path integral\nover the regularized geometries. This has to be done in order to obtain a final\ntheory which does not depend on many of the arbitrary details which have gone\ninto constructing the regularized model, which itself constitutes only an intermediate step in the construction of the theory. Using a finite \"lattice spacing\"\na and taking a \u2192 0 (while renormalizing the coupling constants of the theory\nas a function of a) is a method borrowed from the theory of critical phenomena and virtually ensures that the end result does not depend on a variety of\nregularization details. This latter property of \"universality\" is only a necessary\ncondition and does by no means guarantee that this construction leads to a viable theory of quantum gravity, as opposed to describing the dynamics of certain\none-dimensional polymers, say, as we will explain further in the next section.11\n\nThe ensemble of virtual spacetime geometries in CDT\nNow that we have introduced the regularized triangulated geometries the question\nstill remains as to exactly what ensemble of such objects should be included in\nthe sum over geometries in (2). Here is where CDT differs in a crucial way from\nprevious approaches, and where the notion of \"causality\" comes into play. We\nmentioned above that precursors of CDT's nonperturbative path integral are \"Euclidean\" in nature. What this means is that the integration is not performed over\nso-called Lorentzian spacetimes (which have one time- and three space-directions)\nbut over Euclidean spaces (which have four spatial directions, and thus no notion\nof time, light rays or causality). Classically, Euclidean \"spacetimes\" are bizarre\nand unphysical entities, in which moving back and forth in time is just as easy\nas moving back and forth in space. Their use in the (mainly perturbative) gravitational path integral was made popular in the late 1970s by the influential work\nof S. Hawking and collaborators on black holes and quantum cosmology in the\ncontext of Euclidean quantum gravity [20]. The reason for using them instead of\n11\nOne may feel tempted to postulate that the cutoff a is a fundamental shortest length scale\npertaining to the existing physical world, and thus do away with any continuum limits. Apart\nfrom having to justify such an ad-hoc assumption, one would then have to face the fact that the\nquantum processes at this scale, which such a \"theory\" may describe, will by default depend on\na large number of a priori arbitrary regularization parameters labelling all possible choices of\nfundamental building blocks and gluing rules, and thus run the danger of having no predictive\nvalue at all.\n\n11\n\n\fLorentzian spacetimes of the correct physical signature12 is mainly technical: in\nthe Euclidean case, the weights exp(iS grav ) are no longer complex but real numbers, which simplifies a discussion of the convergence properties of the path integral, and also makes Monte-Carlo simulations possible.13 The potential catch is\nthat in gravity, unlike in other quantum field theories on a flat background, there\nis no obvious relation between a nonperturbative path integral for Lorentzian and\none for Euclidean geometries. In fact, causal dynamically triangulated gravity in\ndimensions two [21], three [22] and four [23, 24, 6, 7, 8, 9, 25] has for the first time\nprovided concrete evidence that the two path integrals are genuinely inequivalent and possess completely different properties. The remainder of this section\nexplains in more detail how the path integral for either Euclidean or Lorentzian\ngravity in terms of triangulated geometries is set up and evaluated, and at the\nsame time retraces some of the history that led to the introduction of CDT.\nWith the ingredients that were defined in the previous section, it would seem\nstraightforward to write down a regularized version of the gravitational propagator as\nX\nreg\neiS [T ] ,\n(3)\nGreg (Ti , Tf , t) :=\ntriangulations T: Ti \u2192Tf\n\nwhere T denotes a triangulated spacetime, glued from four-simplices, and with\ntwo spatial triangulated boundary geometries Ti and Tf (glued from three-simplices), between which it interpolates. The gravitational action for a piecewise flat\nspacetime T schematically takes the form\nS reg (T ) = \u22121/GN Curvature(T ) + \u03bb Volume(T ),\n\n(4)\n\nand there is a definite prescription for how to compute the curvature and volume\nof a given triangulation T in terms of the lengths of its edges and its connectivity\n(that is, the way the four-simplices are glued together). The two coupling constants of the theory appearing in (4) are Newton's constant GN , governing the\nstrength of gravitational interactions, and the cosmological constant \u03bb, another\nconstant of nature, which may be responsible for the \"dark energy\" pervading\nour universe [26].\nAs mentioned in footnote 10, all simplices used in DT are equilateral14 , and\nthe path integral assumes the form of a discrete sum over inequivalent ways in\n12\n\nThe signature refers to the signs of the four eigenvalues of the symmetric matrix g\u03bc\u03bd (x); it\nis (+,+,+,+) in the Euclidean case and (-,+,+,+) in the Lorentzian case.\n13\nIn order to simplify notation, we will always use the notation exp(iS) to denote Boltzmann\nweights, with the implicit understanding that S is a real action when we talk about Lorentzian\nsignature (and the weight thus a complex phase factor), and a purely imaginary one in a\nEuclidean context (and exp(iS) therefore a real quantity).\n14\nTo be precise, this is true for the Euclidean version of dynamical triangulations (DT); CDT\noperates with two different edge lengths, one for all edges that have a spatial orientation, and\none for edges with a time-like orientation [24].\n\n12\n\n\fwhich the simplicial building blocks can be glued together. The only thing that\nremains then to be specified in (3) is whether any gluing of the building blocks is\nto be allowed, or whether further restrictions need to be imposed. One condition\nturns out to be essential for making the path integral construction well-defined.\nCall N (N4 ) the number of distinct gluings of N4 four-simplices, for a particular\nset of gluing rules. Clearly, this number will grow with N4 , but the important\nquestion is whether it will grow exponentially as a function of N4 or faster, namely,\n\"super-exponentially\", for example, like exp(cN4\u03bd ), with c > 0 and \u03bd > 1. In the\nlatter case, and noting that N4 (T ) is proportional to Volume(T), there is no\nway in which the exponential weights exp iS reg [T ] could ever counterbalance the\ngrowth of the number of contributing geometries (the growth of the so-called\n\"entropy\" of the system). The path integral would then be too divergent to lead\nto a fundamental theory of gravity.\nThese considerations preclude the inclusion in the path integral (3) of a socalled \"sum over topologies\".15 Therefore, the topology of the spacetimes contributing to the nonperturbative path integral has to be fixed. It is typically\nchosen to be a four-dimensional sphere or torus. This state of affairs is somewhat\nironic, because the possibility of including a sum over topologies has often been\npraised as an advantage of the path integral formulation over canonical quantization methods, which employ a 3+1 split of spacetime into space and time.\nAs we have argued, this is only true at a formal level, that is, as long as one\ndoes not perform concrete computations (and therefore has to worry about the\nconvergence or otherwise of an expression like (3)). At least from a Euclidean\npoint of view, there are now no further natural restrictions one may impose on\nthe geometries, and it is from this starting point that the original approach of\nDynamical Triangulations proceeded [19, 27], in order to study the properties of\nthe theory (hopefully) defined by the continuum limit of (3).\nThis may be a convenient moment to make some non-technical remarks on\nhow (C)DT evaluates the path integral and extracts physical information from\nit, such as the expectation values of certain geometric observables. A direct analytical evaluation of (3) \u2013 although available in lower-dimensional models \u2013 is\nformidably difficult. However, unlike in a variety of other approaches to quantum gravity, DT possesses a set of powerful and well-developed numerical tools,\nwhose value can hardly be overstated. They have been adapted from statistical\nmechanics and the theory of critical phenomena to the case where the individual\n15\n\nThe topology of a spacetime describes the way in which it hangs together. For example, the\ntopology of a two-dimensional compact and closed surface is completely characterized by the\nnumber of its \"holes\" or \"handles\". It could have the form of a surface of a ball (no holes), of\na surface of a torus or bicycle inner tube (one hole), of a surface of a double-torus or two-hole\ndoughnut (two holes), and so on. In four dimensions, the labelling of different topologies is\nmuch more involved.\n\n13\n\n\fconfigurations are curved geometries, rather than spin or field configurations on\na fixed background space or lattice. The ensemble of spacetimes underlying the\npath integral is simulated by Monte Carlo methods [28], generating a random\nwalk in the space of all configurations according to a probability distribution defined by (3).16 The limitations of the computer imply that this procedure can\nonly be implemented on a (possibly large but) finite space of geometric configurations.17 This is usually taken into account by performing the simulations on\nthe ensemble of triangulations of a fixed discrete volume N4 . By repeating the\nnumerical measurements for a variety of different N4 's, one then tries to extrapolate the results in a systematic way to the physically relevant limit N4 \u2192 \u221e.\nThis well-known technique is known as \"finite-size scaling\".\nNow, what kind of \"quantum geometry\" does one expect to see with the help\nof these tools? If all goes well, the quantum superposition (3) of geometries\nshould be able to reproduce a classical spacetime at large scales L, that is, in the\nclassical limit. However, at small scales l, with a \u226a l \u226a L, one expects quantum\nfluctuations to dominate, with a resulting highly nonclassical behaviour of the geometry. To cut a long story short, this was unfortunately not what was found for\nthe Euclidean dynamically triangulated path integral studied in the 1990s. This\nwas not immediately realized, but emerged gradually as more numerical simulations were performed [29]. It turned out that the quantum geometry generated\nby Euclidean DT could be in either one of two \"phases\". In the first one the\ngeometry was completely crumpled, and in the other totally polymerized, that\nis, degenerated into thin branching threads18 . These structures persist also at\nlarge scales, and as a result the DT path integral appears to have no meaningful\nclassical limit, and therefore does not satisfy a necessary criterion for a theory of\nquantum gravity. (One can only wonder how long it may have taken to realize\nthis, had one not been in a state to perform extensive simulations of the model.)\nThe starting point of CDT was the hypothesis that this failure may have to\ndo with the unphysical Euclidean nature of the construction, and that one may\nbe able to rectify the situation by encoding the causal structure of Lorentzian\nspacetimes explicitly in the choices of building blocks and gluing rules. Several\nyears passed since this initial conjecture, in which CDT's causal quantization\nprogram was implemented and its viability tested in lower dimensions [21, 22].\nNamely, superpositions like (3) can be defined also by considering spacetimes\n16\n\nFor the Euclidean path integral, one can directly use the real weights exp iS reg [T ]. For the\nLorentzian case of CDT, in order to obtain a probability distribution from (3), one first has\nto apply a so-called \"Wick rotation\" which converts the complex to real weights [24] (see also\nfootnote 13).\n17\nThe computer power involved in obtaining the results reported here amounted to a few\nPCs and work stations.\n18\nSee the next section for a geometric characterization of these phases.\n\n14\n\n\fglued from two- or three-dimensional building blocks. This gives rise to simplified\ntoy models which share some, but by no means all properties of the true CDT path\nintegral. On the plus side, they can be tackled both analytically and numerically,\nand compared with other quantization approaches to Einstein gravity in two and\nthree spacetime dimensions. These extensive investigations showed unequivocally\nthat the causal, Lorentzian path integral in all cases gave different results from\nthe corresponding Euclidean path integral. Encouraged by this and a number\nof further interesting and new results pertaining to lower-dimensional quantum\ngravity, the investigation moved on to the four-dimensional case in 2004.\n\nCausality implies four-dimensionality!\nWe will now describe the first piece of evidence which showed that CDT can\nreproduce at least some aspects of classical geometry correctly. This concerns\na point where previous related quantization attempts have failed, namely, to\ngenerate a geometric object that can be said to be four-dimensional on sufficiently\nlarge scales.\nIt may come as a surprise that a superposition of locally four-dimensional\ngeometries can give anything that is not again four-dimensional. After all, we\nhave obtained our geometric building blocks by cutting out small pieces from a\nfour-dimensional flat space. However, as is illustrated by Euclidean dynamically\ntriangulated models, it is perfectly possible that the dimension comes out not as\nfour, and this is indeed what seems to happen generically. The crumpled and\npolymeric phases of the Euclidean model mentioned in the previous section are\ncharacterized by a so-called Hausdorff dimension which takes the values infinity\nand two respectively.19\nHow can one obtain spaces with such strange dimensionalities? Roughly\nspeaking, the Hausdorff dimension is obtained by comparing the typical linear\nsize r of a convex subspace of a given space (e.g. its diameter) with its volume\nV (r). If the leading behaviour is V (r) \u223c r dH , the space is said to have the\nHausdorff dimension dH . To obtain an effectively infinite-dimensional space from\ngluing N4 four-dimensional simplices with edge length a, one may consider a sequence of triangulations whose volume goes to infinity, N4 \u2192 \u221e, where the gluing\nfor each fixed N4 is chosen such that every single building block shares a given\nvertex. That is, no matter how large N4 gets, all building blocks of the triangulated space crowd around a single point. This is a procedure which is compatible\nwith the gluing rules, but gives rise to a space whose dimensionality diverges,\nsimply because its linear size always stays at the cutoff length a. Conversely,\n19\n\nInterestingly, one observes the same behaviour when one starts from three- instead of fourdimensional building blocks. This result is believed to hold generically in Euclidean DT models,\nas long as the dimensionality of the elementary building blocks is at least three.\n\n15\n\n\fone can get an effectively one-dimensional space by gluing the four-dimensional\nbuilding blocks into a long and thin tube. That is, as N4 \u2192 \u221e and a \u2192 0, one\nkeeps three out of the four directions at a size of the order of the cutoff a, and\nonly grows the geometry along the fourth direction.\nThis argument shows that there are spaces with \"exotic\" dimensionality which\ncan be obtained as limiting cases of regular simplicial manifolds. Of course, the\nrelevant question for the gravitational path integral is whether geometries of\nthis nature indeed dominate the path integral in the continuum limit. This is\na genuinely dynamical question which cannot be decided a priori. It depends\non the relative weight of \"energy\" and \"entropy\", that is to say, the Boltzmann\nweight of a given geometry (which in turn is a function of the values of the bare\ncoupling constants) and the number of geometries with a given, fixed Boltzmann\nweight. Thus it may happen that an exotic geometry (for example, one of the\nhighly crumpled objects above) has a very large Boltzmann weight and is therefore\n\"energetically favoured\", but that there are relatively speaking far fewer of such\nobjects in the ensemble than there are of the more \"normal\" geometries, such\nthat the contribution of the former will in the end play no role in the path\nintegral in the continuum limit. As we have seen, this is not what happens\nin Euclidean dynamically triangulated models for quantum gravity whose state\nsums, depending on the values of the coupling constants, are dominated by exotic\ngeometries which are either maximally crumpled (dH = \u221e) or of the form of socalled branched polymers (with dH = 2).\nThe finding that \"dimensionality\" is turned into a dynamical quantity is a\nconsequence of the fact that the nonperturbative gravitational path integral contains highly nonclassical geometries which are curved (and even highly curved)\nat the cutoff scale a. It can and indeed does happen that geometries with such\nan unruly short-scale behaviour dominate the path integral as a \u2192 0. As already\nremarked earlier, this is exactly what one would expect in analogy with the path\nintegral for the particle, which in the continuum limit is dominated by totally\nnonclassical paths with \"infinitely many corners\". It is important to emphasize\nthat the short-scale picture of geometry that arises in CDT is completely different\nfrom that of the classical theory. If one looks at a piece of classical spacetime \u2013\nno matter how curved \u2013 with an ever finer resolution, it will always eventually\nstart looking like a piece of flat spacetime, namely, when the observed scale becomes much smaller than the characteristic scale at which the space is curved.\nBy contrast, a typical \"quantum spacetime\" generated by our nonperturbative\npath integral construction will never resemble a flat space, no matter how fine we\nchoose the resolution of our virtual magnifying glass.\nHaving understood that quantum geometry will necessarily look very nonclassical at short scales, we presumably are still left with many possibilities for the\nprecise microstructure that is generated by various prescriptions for setting up\n16\n\n\fthe gravitational path integral. Can we formulate criteria for recognizing when a\nparticular prescription stands a chance of leading to the correct theory of quantum gravity? Fortunately, the answer is yes, and the criteria in question have to\ndo with reproducing features of classical geometry at sufficiently large scales. As\nalluded to above, the simplest such test is whether the quantum geometry has the\ncorrect dimension four at large distances. A path integral which does not pass\nthis test simply does not qualify as a candidate for a theory of quantum gravity.\nThe art is then to come up with a path integral which allows for large shortscale fluctuations in curvature, but in such a way that the resulting large-scale\ngeometry nevertheless does not degenerate completely, so that a sensible classical\nlimit may exist. The method of causal dynamical triangulations has for the first\ntime in the history of the nonperturbative gravitational path integral given us an\nexplicit example of such a geometry. What has been found to be crucial in its\nderivation are certain causal rules one imposes on the triangular building blocks,\nwhich make explicit reference to the Lorentzian structure of the individual geometries contributing to the path integral. The new and intriguing physical insight\nthat can therefore be deduced from this result is that causality at sub-Planckian\nscales may be responsible for the fact that our universe is four-dimensional [6, 9].\nA related lesson that has been made explicit by the dynamical triangulations\napproach in general is the fact that once geometric excitations are \"let loose\"\nin a nonperturbative formulation of quantum gravity, just about anything can\nhappen. Not even the dimensionality of (what we thought of as) the spacetime\nemerging from the quantum superposition has to come out right. At the same\ntime one could therefore also worry that other nonperturbative quantum gravity approaches may suffer related pathologies, which have only gone undetected\nbecause one has not been able to determine expectation values like that of the\nHausdorff dimension hdH i explicitly.\nThe reader may by now be curious about the precise nature of the causality\nconditions present in the CDT approach. They are simply that each spacetime\nappearing in the sum over geometries should have a specific form. Namely, it\nshould be a geometric object which can be obtained by evolving a purely spatial\ngeometry in time, in such a way that its spatial topology (the way in which\nspace hangs together) is unchanged as a function of time. An example of a\nforbidden spacetime is one where an initially connected space splits into two or\nseveral components, or the converse process where several components of a space\nreunite into a single one [30]. Spacetimes with so-called wormholes also fall into\nthis category and will therefore not be included in the sum over geometries. So,\nwhat is wrong with these geometries? Why do they violate causality? Let us\nstart by explaining why these geometries are pathological from a classical point\nof view. Imagine a three-dimensional space that undergoes a branching process\nas time progresses (Fig. 3). Initially the space consists of a single piece (or\n17\n\n\f\u03c4\n\nFigure 3: A \"trouser\" spacetime as example of a spacetime with topology change. Twodimensional rendering of a space (here depicted as a one-dimensional circle) splitting\ninto two components as time \u03c4 progresses. The smooth assignment of light cones must\nbreak down at the marked branching point, because the light cone \"does not know\nwhere to turn\".\ncomponent), which simply means that any point in the space can be reached\nfrom any other point along a continuous path. At some moment in time, the\nspace splits into two components which then remain cut off from each other.\nClassically this represents a highly singular process, with nothing to suggest such\nprocesses actually occur in nature.20 From a spacetime point of view, something\nin these processes goes wrong with the light cone structure. The assignment\nof light cones to spacetime points cannot be smooth, since there must be at\nleast one point in spacetime (precisely the branching point) where it cannot be\ndecided whether a light ray arriving from the past should be continued to the\nfuture in one or the other of the two spatial components. Since the light cones\ndefine the causal structure of spacetime, this is an example of a geometry where\ncausality is violated. The classical Einstein equations simply cannot describe\nsuch topology-changing spacetimes. Two more things should be noted: firstly,\nthe absence of branching points (and their time inverses, the joining points) from a\nLorentzian geometry is invariant under diffeomorphisms because different notions\nof time always share the same overall direction of their \"time flow\".21 In order\nto introduce branching points and their associated \"baby universes\" (those parts\nof the universe that branch out from the \"mother universe\", never to return),\none would need to reverse the time flow in entire open regions of spacetime,\n20\n\nIf this were the case, we would see whole chunks of space (together with their contents)\nsuddenly disappear.\n21\nWe are not considering the possibility of a complete reversion of the time flow, which\nexchanges past and future globally.\n\n18\n\n\fwhich cannot be done by an allowed coordinate transformation. Secondly, in the\nEuclidean theory, which has no distinguished (class of) time direction(s), one\nsimply cannot talk about the absence or presence of analogous branching points\nin a meaningful (i.e. coordinate-invariant) manner.\nReturning to our discussion of the quantum theory, the premise of CDT is to\nuse the Lorentzian structure of its contributing geometries explicitly and exclude\nall spacetimes with topology changes and therefore acausal behaviour.22 Although\nclassical considerations of causality have motivated a similar implementation of\ncausality in CDT, it should be emphasized that such constraints on the path integral histories can never be derived conclusively from the classical theory. After\nall, the individual path integral geometries are never going to be smooth classical\nobjects (let alone solutions to the equations of motion), nor even close to classical\ngeometries. There is hence no obvious reason to forbid any particular quantum\nfluctuations of the geometry, including those that include topology changes. In\nprinciple, a quantum superposition of acausal spacetimes could lead to a quantum spacetime where causality by some mechanism is restored dynamically, at\nleast macroscopically. However, although this is a theoretical possibility, it is\nnot what one has observed in the Euclidean version of DT which does not have\nsuch causality restrictions, and which goes wrong already in trying to reconstruct\na four-dimensional space. By the same token, the fact that individual path integral geometries in CDT are causal is also not by itself sufficient to guarantee\nthat the quantum geometry it generates has again the same property. Whether\nthis is indeed the case is not yet known, and requires a more detailed knowledge\nabout the local geometric structure than is currently available. For example, one\nwould like to ascertain that at a sufficiently coarse-grained level the quantum\ngeometry possesses a well-defined light cone structure by defining and measuring\nsuitable quantum observables. \u2013 However, there are already a number of important facts known about the large- and small-scale structure of the quantum\nspacetime emerging in CDT from first principles, which form the subject of the\nfollowing section.\n\nWhat is the quantum spacetime generated by CDT?\nWe have emphasized in the last section the importance of the emergence of classical geometry as a test for potential quantum gravity theories. The dimensionality\nof spacetime is only one of many quantum observables one may try to evaluate\nin order to determine the properties of the ground state geometry generated by\n22\n\nIt is rather straightforward to implement the causality conditions on the triangulated geometries of CDT. Each spacetime is built from layers of fixed duration (one \"length step\" in\nproper time), and one implements gluing rules for the simplices which ensure that no change\nof spatial topology can occur during the step [24].\n\n19\n\n\fCDT at various length scales. It is the coarsest such variable, because the dimensionality of a spacetime \u2013 at least in classical differential geometry \u2013 precedes\nthat of specifying a metric structure.\nTalking about observables, one must keep in mind that an innocent-looking\nquestion like \"what is the value of the metric tensor g\u03bc\u03bd at point x?\" is among the\nmost difficult to answer in a nonperturbative approach like ours. Firstly, although\nCDT histories come with a notion of proper time, they do not otherwise carry\nany natural coordinate system. Even if we introduced coordinate systems on the\nindividual triangulated spacetimes, there is no way to mark \"the same point\"\nsimultaneously in all of them. This is a consequence of the fact that individual\npoints do not have any physical significance in empty space; in the absence of\nmatter there is simply nothing we could \"mark\" the point x with. We are thus\nforced to phrase any question about local curvature properties, say, in terms\nof quantities that are meaningful in the context of a diffeomorphism-invariant\ntheory, for example, n-point correlation functions where the location of each of\nthe n points has been averaged over spacetime.23\nThe correlation function that has been studied up to now in CDT measures\nthe correlation between the volumes Vspace (\u03c4 ) of spatial slices (slices of constant\ntime \u03c4 ) some fixed proper-time distance \u2206\u03c4 apart, that is, a suitably normalized\nversion of the expectation value\nhVspace (0)Vspace (\u2206\u03c4 )i =\n\nt\nX\n\u03c4 =0\n\nhVspace (\u03c4 )Vspace (\u03c4 + \u2206\u03c4 )i,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the ensemble average is taken over simplicial spacetimes with time extension t and with fixed four-volume [6, 7, 9]. One piece of evidence for the\nfour-dimensionality of spacetime at large distances is the fact that in order to\nmap the functions hVspace (0)Vspace (\u2206\u03c4 )i on top of each other for different values\nof the spacetime volume N4 , the time distance \u2206\u03c4 has to be rescaled by the power\n1/D\nN4 H , where the \"cosmological Hausdorff dimension\" is DH = 4 within measuring accuracy [6, 9]. This means that what we would like to call a continuum\n\"time\" really scales with the correct fraction of the total spacetime volume. Such\na \"canonical scaling\" is what one would have expected na\u0131\u0308vely, but is absolutely\nnot ensured a priori in the presence of large geometric quantum fluctuations, even\nthough the individual building blocks at the cutoff scale are four-dimensional.24\nBefore looking at another striking result on dimensionality to have come out\nof CDT, let us review what else we know about the large-scale geometry of the\nquantum spacetime dynamically generated by CDT. This concerns a result which\n23\n\nTwo-point functions of this type have been measured previously in Euclidean DT [31].\nFurther, independent evidence that the volumes Vspace (\u03c4 ) of the spatial slices also scale\n3/D\ncanonically as N4 is increased, Vspace \u223c N4 H , with DH = 4, can be found in [9].\n24\n\n20\n\n\fenables us to make contact with (quantum) cosmology. Recall the remarkable fact\nthat almost every aspect of today's standard model of cosmology, describing the\nlarge-scale structure of our universe, is based on a radical truncation of (the\ngeometric sector of) Einstein's theory to a single global degree of freedom, the\nso-called scale factor a(\u03c4 ). It describes the linear size (or \"scale\") of the universe\nas a function of time \u03c4 .25 This truncation is justified if the universe is homogeneous and isotropic at the largest scales, which means that it looks the same\neverywhere and in all spatial directions, something that is usually assumed to be\ntrue. An entirely different question is whether one can extract information about\nthe quantum behaviour of the universe (for example, very close to the big bang\nwhere quantum effects should come into play) by quantizing the classically truncated system of just a single geometric variable a(\u03c4 ). One may wonder whether\nin this way one is not missing important physics contained in the quantum fluctuations of all the local gravitational degrees of freedom which the cosmological\ndescription ignores.\nHaving in hand an explicit construction of quantum geometry \u00e0 la CDT where\nno such truncation is present, one can ask what predictions it makes for the dynamics of the scale factor, and compare those to standard quantum cosmology.\nThe answer obtained is intriguing: it is indeed possible to extract an effective action for the scale factor from CDT by integrating out all other degrees of freedom\nin the full quantum theory. The resulting action takes the same functional form\nas the standard action of a \"minisuperspace\" cosmology for a closed universe, up\nto an overall sign [7]. The collective effect of the local gravitational excitations\nseems to result in the same kind of contribution as that coming from the scale\nfactor itself, but with the opposite sign. One way to understand this from an\nanalogous continuum point of view may be in terms of so-called Faddeev-Popov\ndeterminants, which contribute to the effective action as a result of gauge-fixing\n[32]. The potentially far-reaching consequences of this result for quantum cosmology are currently being explored. What has already been established is that\nthe computer-generated quantum geometry can in the semiclassical approximation be understood as a so-called \"bounce\", a particular type of solution to the\nEuclidean equation of motion (see Fig. 4). On the basis of this, the infamous\n\"wave function of the universe\" \u03a80 (a) [33, 34] has been computed in CDT as a\nfunction of the scale factor a [7].\nHowever, what is also clear from the computer simulations is that the semiclassical approximation is no longer an adequate description of the observed behaviour of the scale factor when the latter becomes small. This is of course to\nbe expected and is an indicator for new quantum-gravitational effects appearing\n25\n\nAs far as we can tell, our present universe not only expands, but expands at an ever\nincreasing rate, that is, both \u0227(\u03c4 ) > 0 and \u00e4(\u03c4 ) > 0. A \"big bang\" or \"big crunch\" corresponds\nclassically to a singular point where a = 0.\n\n21\n\n\fFigure 4: The overall shape of the extended quantum universe generated by CDT is\ndetermined by a bounce solution of the Euclidean effective action for the scale factor\na(\u03c4 ). The figure is a Monte Carlo snapshot of a typical universe of N4 = 91.100 foursimplices and illustrates the behaviour of a(\u03c4 ) (the circumference of the rotational\nbody) as a function of the proper time \u03c4 (vertical axis).\nat short distances. Having gathered some nontrivial evidence that CDT's quantum geometry reproduces well-known aspects of classical general relativity on\nsufficiently large scales, the main focus of research has to be on what the actual\nquantum modifications of this structure are. This is the place where new quantum\nphysics will appear, and our effort will go into describing it in both a qualitative\nand quantitative manner.\nCDT has already given us first insights into what the microstructure of quantum spacetime may be. The evidence comes from yet another way of probing the\neffective dimensionality of spacetime. The idea is to define a diffusion process\n(equivalently, a random walk) on the triangulated geometries in the path integral\nover spacetimes, and to deduce geometric information of the underlying quantum\nspacetime from the behaviour of the diffusion as a function of the diffusion time\n\u03c3 inherent to the process. The beauty of this procedure is its wide applicability, since diffusion processes cannot just be defined on smooth manifolds, but on\nmuch more general spaces, such as our triangulations and even on fractal structures [35]. The quantity we are interested in is the so-called \"spectral dimension\",\nwhich is really the effective dimension of the carrier space \"seen\" by the diffusion\nprocess. It can be extracted from the return probability P (\u03c3) which measures the\n22\n\n\f3.8\n\nDS\n\n3.6\n3.4\n3.2\n3\n2.8\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n\u03c3\n\n300\n\n400\n\nFigure 5: The spectral dimension DS of the universe as function of the diffusion\ntime \u03c3, as measured in CDT for a quantum universe of N4 = 181.000 building blocks.\nExtrapolating from this data, one obtains the estimates DS (\u03c3 = \u221e) = 4.02 \u00b1 0.1 in\nthe limit of large distances and DS (\u03c3 = 0) = 1.80 \u00b1 0.25 for the short-distance spectral\ndimension [8, 9]. The two outer curves represent error bars.\n\nprobability of a random walk to have returned to its origin after diffusion time\n\u03c3 (or \u03c3 evolution steps if the diffusion is implemented discretely). For diffusion\non a flat d-dimensional manifold, we have the exact relation P (\u03c3) = 1/(4\u03c0\u03c3)d/2 .\nFor general spaces we define the spectral dimension DS (\u03c3) as the logarithmic\nderivative26\nd log P (\u03c3)\nDS (\u03c3) := \u22122\n.\n(6)\nd log \u03c3\nNote that in general this dimension will depend on \u03c3: small values of \u03c3 probe\nthe small-distance properties of the underlying space, and large values its largedistance geometry.27 The spectral dimension extracted for the quantum geometry\nof CDT is a twofold average over the starting point of the diffusion process (which\nis initially peaked at a given four-simplex) and over all geometries contributing\nto the path integral [8, 9]. The result of the measurement is quite striking and\nplotted in Fig. 5. What one observes is indeed a scale-dependence of the spacetime dimension! At large distances it approaches the value four asymptotically, in\nagreement with the dimension obtained previously from scaling arguments, and\n26\n\nThe complete expression for the return probability has correction terms because of the\nfinite size of the computer-generated geometries which we are suppressing for simplicity. A\nmore detailed discussion can be found in [9].\n\u221a\n27\nAs usual in a random walk, the linear distance probed will be of the order of \u03c3.\n\n23\n\n\fin agreement with our classical expectation. However, as we probe the geometry\nat ever shorter distances (and before we enter the region where the simulations\nbecome unreliable due to discretization effects), this dimension decreases continuously to an extrapolated value of two within measuring accuracy. Such a\nscale-dependence has never before been observed in statistical models of quantum gravity and is a clear indication that spacetime behaves highly nonclassically\nat short distances close to the Planck length. Further investigations of a number of critical exponents and dimensions associated with the geometric structure\nof spatial slices and \"sandwiches\" (of time extension \u2206\u03c4 = 1) [9] suggest the\npresence of a fractal microstructure of quantum spacetime, whose details are the\nsubject of ongoing research.\nIn an independent development, a similar smooth running from four to two\nof the spectral dimension has been derived within a renormalization group approach to quantum gravity in the continuum [36], which posits (and provides\nsome evidence for) the existence of a nontrivial fixed point in the ultraviolet (i.e.\nshort-distance) regime of quantum gravity [37]. Although this coincidence by no\nmeans proves that either formulation is correct, it is nevertheless remarkable that\nthe same unexpected result has been obtained in two very different approaches\nto quantum gravity. If the result can indeed be shown to be part and parcel\nof a viable quantum gravity theory, its implications for how we view spacetime\nand how we compute quantum processes of the other fundamental interactions on\nspacetime may be profound. For example, it could provide a natural ultraviolet\ncutoff for scattering amplitudes in high-energy physics.\n\nConclusions and outlook\nThis article has offered an overview of some of the fundamental issues addressed\nby quantum gravity, and has described a particular attempt to arrive at a consistent quantum theory of gravity, through the use of causal dynamical triangulations (CDT). As we hope to have illustrated, this approach has yielded a\nnumber of concrete results concerning the emergence of classical geometry from a\nFeynman-type superposition of spacetimes, provided appropriate care was taken\nto eliminate spacetimes with acausal features from the nonperturbative gravitational path integral. Although the derivation of the four-dimensionality of\nspacetime \"from scratch\" is an unprecedented result, more features of the classical theory still need to be established, for example, the presence of attractive\ngravitational forces as expressed by Newton's law. Assuming that this can be\naccomplished, the really interesting and new physics lies of course beyond the\nclassical approximation. Here the challenge will be to extract more detailed information about the short-scale structure of quantum spacetime and, if possible,\nto uncover concrete physical consequences that may in principle be detectable.\n24\n\n\fAs we have seen, CDT offers already some tantalizing glimpses of what spacetime\nmay look like at or near the Planck scale.\nIt is unlikely that the construction we have presented here will satisfy everyone's prejudices of how a quantum theory of gravity should be constructed, be it\nthrough invoking this or that kind of fundamental discrete structure at the Planck\nscale or according to this or that favourite symmetry principle. This need not\nnecessarily be a reason for concern: if we can find one way to Rome, we will be\nable to find many others. That is to say, we believe (in the spirit of \"universality\")\nthat there is at most one theory which describes the nontrivial quantum dynamics\nof intrinsic spacetime geometry, and that in order to construct it, we should just\nget a few \"basic things\" right, among them presumably some genuinely nonperturbative features (like the inclusion of locally highly curved geometries which\nare \"very far away\" from any classical spacetimes), and possibly a principle of\n\"microcausality\", like that implemented in CDT to ensure the emergence of an\nextended, four-dimensional spacetime.\nWhat remains to be shown is that a single such theory with the correct properties exists. Because of the minimalist input we have used in our construction\n(no new symmetries, no new dynamical fields or other extended objects, no additional spacetime dimensions, and thus no associated new free parameters) we\nare unlikely to run into the converse, \"M-theoretic\" problem of having vast numbers of possible vacua [38] and therefore possible theories of quantum gravity,\nwith a continuum of different physical predictions. The paradigm of spacetime\nbeginning to emerge from CDT is that of a scale-invariant, fractal and effectively\nlower-dimensional structure at the Planck scale, which only at a larger scale acquires well-known features of geometry which accord with our classical intuition.\nThe deeper reasons for how and why this comes about remain to be understood.\nAcknowledgement.

After fellowships at Caltec and Nordita he moved to the Niels\nBohr Institute where he is now a professor. His research interests include quantum gravity, string theory, gauge theory and cosmology (in particular questions\nrelated to the baryon asymmetry of the universe), and he has been involved\nin numerous analytical and numerical investigations of their properties. He is\none of the founders of the non-perturbative \"Dynamical Triangulations\" or \"Matrix Model\" approach to string theory and quantum gravity, which provides a\ndiffeomorphism-invariant regularization and allows for both analytical solutions\nand numerical simulations of these theories. Most recently his research has been\ncentred around \"Causal Dynamical Triangulations\" and the corresponding theory\nof quantum gravity.\nJerzy Jurkiewicz obtained his PhD in Theoretical Physics at the Jagellonian\nUniversity in Krakow in 1975. His scientific work was initially centred on lattice\ngauge theories, with visiting professorships held in Marseille (1981), Paris-Sud\n(1982) and Utrecht (1983/84). His interest in simplicial quantum gravity dates\nfrom this period, and was followed by extensive research work in Krakow and\nCopenhagen, where he spent several years as a visiting professor at the Niels\nBohr Institute. His main area of research is the field-theoretical description of\nsystems with dynamical geometry, which besides quantum gravity includes random networks and applications in complex financial systems. He is currently head\nof the Mark Kac Complex Systems Research Centre and head of the Department\nof the Theory of Complex Systems of the Institute of Physics, both at the Jagellonian University.\nRenate Loll studied at Freiburg University, the London School of Economics,\nand Imperial College, where she obtained her PhD in Theoretical Physics in\n1989. She subsequently decided to work on quantum gravity, then as now one\nof the most challenging unsolved problems in high-energy physics. After postdoc\npositions in Bonn, Syracuse, Pennsylvania State University and Florence, she became a research associate at the Max-Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in\nGolm, where she also held a Heisenberg Fellowship. Since then, she has been one\nof the main proponents of the new \"Causal Dynamical Triangulations\" approach\nto quantum gravity. In 2001, she joined the Institute for Theoretical Physics of\nUtrecht University, where she has been Professor for Theoretical Physics since\n2005. She is the scientific coordinator of ENRAGE, the European Network on\nRandom Geometry.\n\n31\n\n\f"}
