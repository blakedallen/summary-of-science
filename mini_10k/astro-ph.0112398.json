Polarization \u2013 Radiation mechanisms: non-thermal \u2013 Radiative transfer \u2013 Galaxies: jets \u2013 Accretion,\naccretion disks \u2013 Radio continuum: general\n\n1. Introduction\nThe detection of circular polarization (CP) in the continuum of radio sources is believed to be a powerful tool to\ntest physical source models (Hodge & Aller 1979). But CP\nin extragalactic radio sources is extremely elusive (Roberts\net al. 1975; Ryle & Brodie 1981; Weiler & de Pater 1983)\nand is detected in only a few sources.\nA more recent ATCA-survey (Rayner, Norris & Sault\n2000) for CP in radio-loud Quasars, BL Lacs and Radio\nGalaxies with improved sensitivity of 0.01%, has shown a\nclear correlation of fractional CP with spectral index, in\nthe sense that CP is stronger in flat and inverted spectrum\nsources. Circularly polarized radiation is therefore preferentially produced in self-absorbed radio cores. The fractional CP at 5 GHz is found to be between 0.05% and 0.5%\nin 11 out of 13 inverted spectrum sources at the ATCA\nspatial resolution of 2 arcsec. At higher VLBA-resolution\n(\u223c 0.5mas) Homan & Wardle (1999) report localized CP\nof 0.3%-1% in the jet-cores of 3C273, PKS 0528+134, and\n3C279, which in a few cases may be as high as the local\nlinear polarization. It is also found, that intraday variable\nsources are circularly polarized (Macquart et al. 2000),\n\nand that LP (linear polarization) and CP are both variable\non timescales below 1 day. Recently CP was also found in\nX-ray binaries (Fender et al. 2000&2002).\nWhile the handedness of CP is remarkably stable over\nseveral years (Komesaroff et al. 1984; Homan & Wardle\n1999; Fender et al. 2002) for individual sources, no preferred handedness of CP in general is found.\nAn even more challenging situation than observed in\nradio-loud extragalactic jet sources presents itself in the\ncentre of our galaxy. The compact radio source Sgr A\u2217\n(see Melia & Falcke 2001), believed to be coincident with\nthe dynamical centre of the Milky Way with a mass of\n2.6 106M\u2299 (Eckart & Genzel 1996; Ghez et al. 1998) presumably in a single black hole, exhibits consistently larger\ncircular than linear polarization in the range of 1.4 to 15\nGHz (Bower et al. 1999b; Sault & Macquart 1999) with\nCP between 0.2% and 1%. LP is small and below the detection limits (Bower et al. 1999a, 1999c) with the exception of sub-mm measurements, which possibly shows LP\nat a level of 10% in the range 750 \u2212 2000\u03bcm (Aitken et al.\n2000). The beam size of the sub-mm observations is \u223c 10\narcsec. The flux is dominated by extended dust emission\n\n\f2\n\nBeckert & Falcke: Circular Polarisation in Jets\n\nor free-free emission and the synchrotron source is comparably weak at these wavelength.\nThe inverted radio spectrum of Sgr A\u2217 (S\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2248\n0.3) can be interpreted as either optically thin synchrotron\nemission (Beckert et al. 1996) or self-absorbed synchrotron\nemission from a jet-like outflow (Falcke et al. 1993; Falcke\n& Markoff 2000). The idea of synchrotron emission by\nthermal electrons from Sgr A\u2217 was briefly considered by\nReynolds & McKee (1980) and revived for mildly relativistic electrons in the self-absorbed ADAF models for\naccretion in the galactic centre (Narayan et al. 1998). The\nfirst ADAF models under-predicted the radio flux between\n1\u2013100 GHz, which can be attributed to an outflow or jet.\nThe upper limits for Sgr A\u2217 in the infrared require a sharp\nhigh energy cut-off for the electron distribution below \u03b3max\nof a few \u00d7102. Therefore thermal or quasi-monoenergetic\nelectrons are responsible for the radio emission (Beckert\n& Duschl 1997), which distinguishes Sgr A\u2217 from highluminosity, radio-loud AGNs. A close relative of Sgr A\u2217\nis found in the centre of the normal spiral M81. The radio source M81\u2217 exhibits an elongated jet-like structure\n(Bietenholz et al. 2000), has a similiar radio spectrum\n(Reuter & Lesch, 1996), a slightly larger luminosity, still\nbelow the AGN level, and has recently be found to be\ncircularly polarized (Brunthaler et al. 2001) without detectable LP.\nThe fractional variability of CP is usually stronger\nthan of LP, which in turn is stronger than for the total intensity. Together with the preserved handedness this\nposes servere constrains on possible scenarios for CP production and its variability (Komesaroff et al. 1984). The\nsuggested mechanisms are (a) intrinsic cyclo-synchrotron\nemission from low-energy electrons or from electrons with\nsmall pitch angles seen close to the magnetic field direction (Legg & Westfold 1968), conversion from LP to CP as\na propagation effect induced by (b) low energy electrons\ninside the relativistic plasma (Hodge & Aller 1977) or (c)\nby a magnetized cold plasma surrounding the synchrotron\nsource. This requires either Faraday rotation (not possible in pure electron/positron jets) or changing (e.g., turbulent) B-field directions along the line of sight in the source.\nA further possiblity for CP production are (d) inhomogeneous rotation measures in intervening cold plasma either\nclose to the source or in our galaxy (Macquart & Melrose\n2000). The existence of these plasma screens can be infered\nfrom interstellar scattering believed to be the cause for\nintraday variability in some sources (Rickett et al. 1995;\nDennett-Thorpe & de Bruyn 2000; Macquart et al. 2000;\nBeckert et al. 2002). This model predicts variable CP with\na time averaged mean of <CP>= 0.\nIn this paper we consider propagation effects like\nFaraday rotation and cyclic conversion of LP to CP and\nback (Pacholczyk 1973) in turbulent, self-absorbed jets or\noutflows. First results were already published in Falcke et\nal. (2002). We rederive some of the basic radiation transfer coefficients which, for example, could also be used for\nanisotropic particle distributions. The application of conversion to compact radio jets has been explored perviously\n\nby Jones (1988) using different techniques and without\nfocusing on sources with large circular polarization and\nthe role of globally ordered magnetic fields. Here we investigate the standard jet model with respect to the new\npolarization data placing some emphasis on the role of\nturbulence, the ratio of low- to high-energy particles, and\nthe magnetic field confirguation.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Sec. 2 we review the basic production channels for CP. The outfow/jet\nmodel and the possible turbulence in the B-field is presented in Sec. 3. The consequences of Faraday rotation\nand conversion are discussed in Sec. 4 followed by a detailed model of Sgr A\u2217 . Polarization variability is the topic\nof Sec. 5 and we close with a discussion of our results in\nSec. 6.\n\n2. Polarized Synchrotron Emission & Radiative\nTransfer\n2.1. Synchrotron Emission\nRelativistic electrons or positrons gyrate in a magnetic\nfield B with a frequency \u03bdgr = \u03bdB\u22a5 /\u03b3. The basic cyclotron\nfrequency\n\u03bdB\u22a5\n\n\u0015\n\u0014\nB\nqB sin \u03c8\n6\nsin \u03c8\n= 2.8 * 10 Hz\n= \u03bdB sin \u03c8 =\n2\u03c0me c\n1G\n\n(1)\n\ndepends on the field B\u22a5 = B sin \u03c8 perpendicular to the\nparticle momentum. The transition from cyclotron to synchrotron radiation occurs, when emission at higher multiples of the gyro-frequency, which are weak for nonrelativistic particles, become stronger than emission at \u03bdgr\ndue to relativistic boosting in the instantaneous direction\nof the particle. The synchrotron spectrum of individual\nparticles reaches its maximum at \u03bdc = 1/2\u03b3 2 \u03bdB . A population of particles with distributions in energy and pitch\nangle \u03c8 produce an emission spectrum, in which the individual cyclotron lines are blended together and a smooth\nspectrum emerges. The cyclotron emission at low frequencies is circularly polarized and reflects the spiral motion\nof the particles. The emission at the maximum at \u03bdc is\nseen only for a time \u03b3 \u22122 of the gyration period and the\nweakly curved motion during that interval produces the\nlarge linear polarization of synchrotron emission perpendicular to the B-field. The emission of individual electrons\nis also circularly polarized, when the angle of the line of\nsight to the magnetic field \u03b8 is different from the pitch\nangle. Relativistic beaming requires this difference \u2206\u03b8 to\nbe smaller than \u03b3 \u22121 . The left- and right-handed CP for\ndifferent signs of \u2206\u03b8 nearly cancel for an isotropic particle\ndistribution, with a residual proportional to \u03bd \u22121/2 cos \u03b8,\nand cancels completely for a pure electron-positron population. Any deviation from an isotropic pitch angle distribution will enhance the resulting circular polarization.\n\n\fBeckert & Falcke: Circular Polarisation in Jets\n\n2.2. Radiative Transfer\nThe transfer of polarized synchrotron radiation in homogeneous astrophysical plasma was derived by Sazonov\n(1969) in terms of nearly transverse electromagnetic waves\n(see Appendix A). The transfer equations can be formulated for the four Stokes parameters I, Q, U, V (e.g., Jones\n& O'Dell 1977a). The effects included are emission and\nabsorption for I, Q, V separately1 . The derivation of the\nabsorption and general rotation coefficients are given in\nAppendix B and C. For power-law distributions of electrons (Eq. D.1): N (E) \u221d \u03b3 \u2212s between \u03b3min and \u03b3max , and\n2\n2\n\u03b3min\n\u03bdB < \u03bd < \u03b3max\n\u03bdB , the transport coefficients are summarized in Appendix D. Here one has to be aware of the\nultra-relativistic limit used in the derivations. They are\nonly useful for \u03b3\u03b2 sin \u03b8 \u226b 1. This requirement is not always fulfilled when the power-law extends down to \u03b3 of\na few, as will be the conclusion for Sgr A\u2217 . In addition\nthe shape of the distribution at these energies and the assumed perfect isotropy of the pitch-angle distribution are\nuncertain. The principal treatment of more general distributions is presented in the Appendix. Linear polarized\nemission is a fixed fraction of the total emission and the\nrelative emissivity of CP (Legg & Westfold 1968) is\n\u03b7V\n\u221d\n\u03b7I\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bd\n\u03bdB\n\n\u0013\u22121/2\n\ncot \u03b8 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the angle between the line of sight and the magnetic field, which equals the pitch angle for electrons radiating into the direction of the observer. Due to Kirchhoff's\nlaw this relation also holds for the absorption coefficients\n\u03baV /\u03baI = \u03b7V /\u03b7I . Normal modes in a magnetized plasma\nare generally elliptically polarized. They are circular for\npropagation along the magnetic field and coupling to the\ngyration of electrons induce different refractive indices for\nleft- and right-handed modes. This leads to Faraday rotation described by the transfer coefficient \u03baF , which has\nthe dimension of an absorption coefficient, so that after\npropagating a path length \u2206l linear modes rotate by an\nangle \u2206\u03b6 = \u2206l \u03baF .\nDue to the steep frequency dependence of all rotation\ncoefficients Faraday rotation is important at low frequencies\n\u0012 \u0013\u22122\nln \u03b3min\n\u03bd\n\u03baF \u221d\n(3)\ns+1 cos \u03b8 ,\n\u03bdB\n\u03b3min\nwith the power-law index s for the electrons. Intrinsic\nFaraday rotation is dominated by the low-energy end of\nthe electron population and depends on the line of sight\naverage parallel magnetic field in the source.\nPerpendicular to the field the normal modes are linearly polarized and different refractive indices for modes\nparallel and perpendicular to the B-field leads to birefringence and cyclic transformation of U into V with\n1\n\nA suitable transformation of coordinates leaves U parallel\nto the local B-field. Emission and absorption for U vanishes in\nthat situation.\n\n3\n\na rotation angle sin \u2206\u03b6 \u2032 = \u2206l \u03baC when propagating a\ndistance \u2206l. This effect was termed 'repolarization' by\nPacholczyk (1973) and is described by the transfer coefficient \u03baC (see Appendix D)\n\u0012 \u0013\u22123\n\u03bd\n\u2212(s\u22122)\n\u03baC \u221d\n,\n(4)\nsin2 \u03b8\u03b3min\n\u03bdB\nif the source is self-absorbed and emission at frequency \u03bd\nis dominated by high-energy electrons with \u03b3rad \u226b \u03b3min\n2\nor equivalently \u03bd \u226b \u03bdB \u03b3min\n. If we have additional cold\nplasma in or surrounding the emission region, the radiation is modified along its path by additional Faraday ro(c)\n(c)\ntation and conversion \u03baF and \u03baC (see Appendix C). It\nmust be noted that no substantial amount of cold plasma\nn(c) \u2248 n(r) compared to the density of relativistic particles can exist in linearly polarized, compact synchrotron\nsources (TB \u223c 1010...12 K) without depolarizing the emission (Jones & O'Dell 1977b). Inside a source with a homogeneous and well ordered magnetic field Faraday rotation\nis necessary for conversion, because no linear polarized\ncomponent U with electric field parallel to the stationary\nB-Field is otherwise produced.\nAn electron-positron plasma on the other hand shows\nno Faraday rotation and changing magnetic field directions along the line of sight either in an ordered field structure and/or in a turbulent field is required to start conversion. The contribution of protons to Faraday rotation and\nconversion is weaker by a factor (me /mp )3 and (me /mp )2\nrespectively. In view of the \u03b3min dependence in Eq. (3) this\nimplies that Faraday rotation by cold protons is as impor2s\ntant as by electrons, if \u03b3min\n/(ln \u03b3min ) \u223c 3/4(mp /me )3 . So\nfor s = 2 a \u03b3min \u223c 475 corresponds to equally strong\nrotation by electrons and protons and consequently no rotation. This is not a strong constraint, but for s = 3 we get\nequally strong rotation from cold protons and relativistic\nelectrons for \u03b3min = 50 and for larger \u03b3min the protons\ndominate rotation.\n\n2.3. Intuitive Approach\nTo visualise the effects and properties of radiation transfer\nin a compact medium and achieve a more intuitive understanding of the relevant effects on polarization, we also\nprovide a more qualitative discussion here. For simplicity\nlet us separate Faraday rotation from conversion and only\npicture purely linearly or circularly polarized waves in a\nhomogeneous magnetic field.\nThe two orthogonal normal modes for propagation perpendicular to the magnetic field are linearly polarized and\na purely circularly polarized wave is split into the two normal modes with a relative phase shift as shown in Fig. 1.\nWithout a phase-shift the wave will be purely linearly polarized. If, for example, a locally homogeneous magnetic\nfield vertically pervades the box in Fig. 1 along the zdirection, electrons or positrons will be free to move along\nthe field lines and resonate with the vertical mode but\nhardly resonate with the horizontal mode along the xdirection. This yields the bi-refringence discussed above.\n\n\f4\n\nBeckert & Falcke: Circular Polarisation in Jets\n\nz\n\nz\ny\ny\n\nx\n\nFig. 1. A circularly polarized wave can be composed of\ntwo orthogonal linearly polarized modes shifted in phase.\nA phase shift would be produced by a plasma in a magnetic field perpendicular to the propagation direction of\nthe waves (here along the z-direction). Without phaseshift the sum of the two modes would be a purely linearly\npolarized wave. The accompanying movie shows the effect\nof how phase-shifts in a region will turn such a linearly\npolarized wave in to a circularly polarized wave (conversion).\n\nThe resonating electrons or positrons will themselves act\nas antennas and emit a somewhat delayed wave that interferes with the incoming vertical mode, leading to a slight\nphase-shift between vertical and horizontal mode. The effect of this shift is shown in the accompanying animation2\nof Fig. 1, where the resulting wave is circularly polarized\nand switches from linear to circular polarization as a function of the shift.\nConversion acts also on initially only linearly polarized radiation. The amount of this conversion will depend\non the misalignment between the incoming wave and the\nmagnetic field direction since, obviously, a phase-shift between two orthogonal modes will have little effect if one\nmode is very small or non-existent. Moreover, a random\ndistribution of magnetic field lines on the plane of the sky\nwill reduce circular polarization from conversion in exactly\nthe same way as linear polarization would be reduced.\nAnalogous to the picture for conversion, one can view a\nlinearly polarized wave as composed of two circularly polarized normal modes when propagating along the magnetic field. This is sketched in Fig. 2, where we will as2\n\nSee also the authors webpage at http://www.mpifrbonn.mpg.de/staff/hfalcke/CP\n\nx\n\nFig. 2. A linearly polarized wave can be composed of two\northogonal circularly polarized modes shifted in phase. A\nphase shift would be produced by a plasma in a magnetic\nfield along the propagation direction of the waves (here\nalong the y-direction). The accompanying movie shows the\neffect of additional phase-shifts on the linear polarization,\nleading to Faraday rotation.\nsume a longitudinal magnetic field, i.e. a field along the\ny-direction. The circular modes will resonate with either\nelectrons or positrons gyrating around the magnetic fields.\nThe latter will again emit a circularly polarized wave, producing a phase-shift when interfering with the incoming\nwave. The effect of the phase-shift in the circular modes\nis shown in the accompanying animation of Fig. 22 , where\none can see that the resulting linearly polarized wave is\nsimply (Faraday) rotated.\nAn important conclusion to remember therefore is,\nthat conversion is mainly produced by magnetic field components perpendicular to the line-of-sight or photon direction, while Faraday rotation is produced by magnetic field\ncomponents along the line-of-sight. Moreover, one can also\nsee that conversion is insensitive to the electron/positron\nratio while Faraday rotation is not. In Fig. 1 an electron\nand an positron are both free to move along the z-axis.\nWhile they will respond in opposite directions to the incoming wave, their respective emitted waves will also have\nopposite signs because of opposite charges and hence be\nidentical. In the case of Faraday rotation, the incoming\nleft- or right-handed circularly polarized wave will only\nresonate with the particle that also has the correct handedness in its gyration \u2013 either electron or positron depending on the magnetic field polarity. A pure pair plasma\nwould therefore produce exactly the same phase shift in\nleft- and right-handed modes and not produce any net\n\n\fBeckert & Falcke: Circular Polarisation in Jets\n\nFaraday rotation. In the case of a charge-excess, the direction of Faraday rotation depends on the sign of the\ncharge-excess (presumably electrons) and the polarity of\nthe magnetic field. This will indirectly also affect the sign\nof circular polarization, if Faraday rotation is the ultimate\ncause of the misalignment between the plane of polarization and the magnetic field direction.\n\n3. Outflow/Jet Models\n3.1. Conical Outflows\nModels of flat spectrum radio cores in AGN assume in\ngeneral a conical jet (Blandford & K\u00f6nigl 1979; Falcke\n& Biermann 1995), in which plasma is flowing out with\nconstant velocity v = \u03b2c and constant half opening angle\n\u03b8 = arcsin(R/z), where z is the coordinate along the jet\nand R the local radius of the jet. The magnetic field in the\njet must have an ordered component, which leads to persistent polarization, and probably a turbulent field3 . The\nordered large-scale field can be separated in modes, which\ncarry magnetic flux and will therefore decay as \u223c z \u22122 , and\nmodes without magnetic flux (e.g. toroidal fields), which\nbehave as\n\u0012 \u0013\u22121\nz\n.\n(5)\nB = B0\nz0\nThe second type of modes dominate at large radii. One\npossible configuration is a force-free equilibrium for a parallel jet (K\u00f6nigl & Choudhuri 1985). The resulting structure can show both a mode with magnetic flux and modes\nof twisted flux tubes with toroidal and two oppositely directed poloidal fields, so that the magnetic flux along z\nvanishes for the second modes. Other configuration may\nnot be force-free but are equally valid. The most likely\nstructure is a helical B-field due to the rotation of the\nfootpoints in an accretion disk. The spiral can be regarded as the superposition of a field component Bz along\nz and a toroidal component B\u03c6 . The slope of the spiral is\n\u03b1S = arcsin(B\u03c6 /Bz ).\nEvery jet in perpendicular pressure equilibrium (rdirection) with its surrounding will suffer adiabatic energy losses. Relativistic electrons, which are injected at the\nbase of the jet, will cool down due to adiabatic expansion,\nwhich leads to inverted radio spectra observed in some\ncore dominated extragalactic radio sources. Further along\nthe jet electrons have to be reaccelerated. Alternatively\nthe jet is highly over-pressured relative to its surrounding and adiabatic losses are negligible consistent with flat\nradio spectra for conical jets cores. It should be noticed,\nthat toroidal fields will induce electric currents and hook\nstresses will confine the jet, if the magnetic field is well\nordered and strong enough to influence the jet dynamics.\n3\nAlfvenic turbulence is expected from diffusive particle acceleration at shock fronts. Pitch angle scattering at Alfven\nwaves will also lead to isotropic particle distributions, which\nwe assume here.\n\n5\n\nOtherwise a cosmic conspiracy of electron cooling (adiabatic and radiative losses) and geometric changes, which\nincludes the evolution of magnetic fields, must be proposed. The variety of observed spectral indices between\n1 and 20 GHz indicates, that intermediate stages, where\nseveral of the effects are present, are quite common. The\nparticle distribution without pair-production N (E, z) in a\ncone can vary as\n\u0012 \u0013\u22122(1+a/3)\nz\nN (E, z) = N (E, zin )\n(6)\nzin\nwhere N (E, zin ) = N (E) is the energy distribution at the\ninjection point. The parameter a is zero for a freely expanding and over-pressured jet and a = 1 for adiabatic\nlosses in pressure equilibrium. Radiative cooling can further change the distribution and may be considered separately. For a conical outflow with partial adiabatic particle\ncooling the resulting sychrotron spectrum can be separated in three spectral regimes.\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u0010\u03b1 = 5/2\n\u0011 optically thick\n\u03b1\ns+4\n5\nself-absorbed (7)\nS\u03bd \u221d \u03bd ,\n\u03b1 = 2 1 \u2212 s+4+4a/3\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u03b1 = (s \u2212 1)/2\noptically thin\n\nThe optically thick regime can only be observed if the outflow terminates at a maximal distance, or fragments into\nsubcomponents, which break the self-similarity of the conical model. In the self-absorbed regime, the flux is dominated by emission from the region around the optical surface (\u03c4 =1-surface). A sufficiently large ratio zout /zin of\nouter to inner radius of the self-similar conical outflow is\nnecessary for it to be observable. Optically thin emission\nis always present at frequencies above \u03bdin = \u03bdabs (zin ), if\nnot other radiation processes like bremsstrahlung or dust\nemission dominate. In some sources the low-frequency\nspectrum can change due to free-free-absorption.\n\n3.2. Turbulence in Jets\nSynchrotron emission from self-absorbed radio sources\nwith brightness temperatures TB of \u223c 1011 K imply\nnear energy equipartition of radiating electrons and/or\npositrons and magnetic field (Readhead 1994). This finding is modified by relativistic Doppler boosting for variable flat spectrum radio cores. VSOP-observations show\nthat the observed TB can be larger than 1012 K (Bower &\nBacker 1998; Tingay et al. 2001) in selected sources. This\nagrees with the observed superluminal speeds \u03b2obs \u223c 5,\nwhich require Doppler factors > 5. The fractional LP of\nradio cores is usually only a few per cent or smaller and requires either strong Faraday depolarization (Tribble 1991)\nor tangled B\u2212fields. The observed rotation measures in\nsome quasars (Taylor 2000) are not sufficient to depolarize the radio emission at cm-wavelength4 and we infer the\npresence of a turbulent contribution to the global B-field\n4\n\nThis is not true anymore, if the rotation measure rises\nsharply towards the centre (RM \u221d z \u22122 or steeper).\n\n\f6\n\nBeckert & Falcke: Circular Polarisation in Jets\n\ndescribed above. The turbulent field is effectively depolarizing the source, if the amplitude of the dominating\nFourier modes of the turbulent field are about a factor of\n2 larger than the local contribution of the global field, so\nthat local field reversals occur. We describe the turbulent\nmagnetic field as a local superposition of incoherent waves\nwith wavenumber k, which decorrelate over distances of a\nfew times their wavelength. For the treatment of radiative\ntransfer in turbulent jets, we consider the turbulence to\nbe frozen in and time evolution to be unimportant.\nThe turbulent wave spectrum is characterized by an\nouter wavelength and corresponding wavenumber kout =\n2\u03c0/L and a dissipation wave number kd . Between these\nwave numbers an inertial range with energy cascading\nfrom small to large wave numbers will develop5 . The local\nstrength and orientation of the turbulent magnetic field\nwill be determined by modes with wave numbers around\nkout and the typical length-scale for changes of the mag\u22121\nnetic field is |B/\u2207B| \u223c kout\n.\nWe assume that the spectral energy density in the inertial range is described by a Kolmogorov spectrum\nE(k) = F \u01eb2/3 k \u22125/3\n\n.\n\n(8)\n\nHere F is a number of order unity. The dissipation wave\nnumber is related to the energy dissipation rate \u01eb by the\ninequality (e.g. Frisch 1995)\nkd4 \u2265 \u01eb \u03bd \u22123\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03bd is the viscosity. The dissipation \u01eb for Alfvenic\nturbulence is then given by\n\u00013/2\n3\nkout vA\n,\n\u01eb = BT2 /(B02 F )\n\n2\nvA\n=\n\nB02\n,\n8\u03c0\u03c1\n\n(10)\n\nwith vA the Alfven velocity in the global field and BT2 /B02\nthe energy density ratio of turbulent to the global field. We\ncan combine the dissipation rate (10) with the estimate for\nthe dissipation wave number (9) to get the viscosity\n\u03bd \u2265 (BT2 /B02 F )1/2 (kout /kd )1/3 vA kd\u22121 .\n\n(11)\n\nIf the energy dissipation process is known, it is possible to\nestimate the thermalisation of magnetic energy along the\njet. One possibility is a first resonance with the gyration\nof protons or relativistic electrons.\n\n3.3. Error Estimate for Radiative Transfer in Turbulent\nFields\nA numerical treatment of radiative transfer in turbulent\nmagnetic field will not resolve incoherent fluctuations with\nwave numbers larger than kn depending on the numerical\ncode. The largest effect possible of the unresolved modes\nwith kn < k < kd is a coherent addition. The critical wave\n5\n\nHere it is implied, that an instability exists, which injects\nenergy into the turbulent cascade at the outer wavelength.\n\nFig. 3.

Analytical Estimates\nTurbulence leads to a reduction of measured polarized\nflux, if observations are not able to resolve the largest\n\u22121\nturbulent scales L \u2248 kout\nin the flow. Additional reduction of polarization occurs along the ray path through the\nsource, if the Faraday optical depth in regions of size L is\nlarge. We define the Faraday cell depth as\n\u03c4F = \u03baF /kout ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere \u03baF is the Faraday rotation coefficient given in (D.3).\nAt a given frequency only the polarized flux from the optical surface is important and will be considered, even if the\n\n\fBeckert & Falcke: Circular Polarisation in Jets\n\nFig. 4.

Acceleration of the ouflowing\n\nplasma (Falcke 1996) also produces inverted radio spectra. For simplicity, this is not explicitly considered here,\nhowever, its effect is essentially covered by the assumed\nscaling of magnetic field and density. Cooling of relativistic particles implies N (\u03b3, z) \u221d \u03b3 \u2212s z \u22122(1+a/3) , where a = 0\nfor freely expanding outflows, and a = 1 for adiabatic\nlosses in pressure equilibrium with the surrounding gas.\nThe spectral index \u03b1 = 0.3 implies a = 0.1(s + 4) \u2248 0.7\nfor our choice of the electron spectrum s = 3.

The magnetic field at the base of the outflow is\n60 G at zin = 10 RS in our model, where the width of the\noutflow equals the distance from the black hole of mass\n2.6 106 M\u2299 . The presumed electron distribution extends\nfrom \u03b3min = 5 to \u03b3max = 250. The high energy cut-off is\nrequired by the infrared limits of Sgr A\u2217 spectrum and resembles a wide quasi-monoenergetic distribution (Beckert\n& Duschl 1997). The low-energy end is set by Faraday\nrotation and conversion to produce the observed polarization in an inhomogeneous, optically thick jet or outflow.\nThe emission becomes optically thin above \u03bd = 5*1011 Hz,\nwhich implies that optical depth is unity for \u03b3rad \u2248 35 at\nthe base of the outflow. Due to the inverted spectrum \u03b3rad\nvaries with radius \u03b3rad \u221d z \u22120.068 , which has to be considered in Eq. 17 and Eq. 18. This implies a weak frequency\ndependence of h\u03c0L i and h\u03c0C i of the model seen in Fig 4.\nBecause Faraday rotation is strong and conversion within\none cell is weak in our model with \u03c4H /\u03c4 \u223c 6.04/(kout R),\nwhere we use an outer scale kout = 50/R, we can use Eq.\n(22) and Eq. (20) to estimate the mean CP and LP. The\nanalytical estimates for h\u03c0L i and h\u03c0C i are shown in Fig.\n4 together with the measured CP and the results from\nnumerical solutions of the transfer problem. These estimates hold as long as the outflow is self-absorbed below\n3 * 1011 Hz.\nThe model for Sgr A\u2217 requires depolarization dominated by a large Faraday rotation depth. In this case the\nouter turbulent scale kout is poorly constraint. For the\nanalytic model of Eq. (20) and (22) to be valid kout has\nto satisfy 6 \u226a kout R \u226a 1250. The lower bound comes\nfrom \u03c4C /\u03c4 \u226a 1 and the upper bound from \u03c4F /\u03c4 \u226b 1.\nThe value for the numerical treatment shown in Fig. 3 and\nFig. 4 is kout R = 50. The resulting spectra for numerical\nsolutions of the radiative transfer problem (Eq. A.5-A.8)\non a 1002 grid covering the jet seen under an angle of\n\u03b8 = 30\u25e6 in the rest frame of the gas is shown in Fig. 3.\n\u22122\nThe required electron density is 2.8 107 (z/10 RS ) cm\u22123\nin a global B-field of 60 (z/10 RS )\u22121 G. The half opening\nangle of the subsonic outflow is 4.5\u25e6 with a bulk motion\nof \u03b2 = 0.4. It turns out that a spiral structure for the\nglobal magnetic field seen under an angle \u03b8 < \u03c0/2 \u2212 \u03b1S is\npreferred for reproducing the level of linear and circular\npolarization. The numerical simulation\n\u221a use a \u03b1S = \u03c0/4spiral corresponding to Bz /B0 = 1/ 2. In the limit of a\nvery long spiral with \u03b1S \u2192 0 the jet must be seen at angle smaller than \u223c 40\u25e6 , because conversion and Faraday\ndepolarization is stronger for small \u03b8 in our model. For\n\n\fBeckert & Falcke: Circular Polarisation in Jets\n\nFig. 7. The spectrum of a typical inner jet component\nin total intensity I (solid line), LP (triangles), CP (diamonds). The fluxes are normalized to the peak flux in I.\nEnergy equipartition between electrons and B-field is assumed. The electron spectral index is s = 2.5 and the\npower-law extends from \u03b3min = 20 to \u03b3max = 104 . The\ncomponent is not homogeneous but is part of a jet with\nzout /zin = 10 and a tight helical field (Bz /B\u03c6 = 1/3) seen\nunder an angle of 55\u25e6 in the rest frame of the radiating\nplasma.\n\nthe assumed electron-proton plasma the kinetic bulk energy is about 7.4 1039 erg/s. Together with the magnetic\nenergy flux, the thermal energy flux derived from the\nhalf opening angle of the flow, and the energy supply\nneeded to overcome the gravitational potential with the\nlarge mass loading of the flow starting at 10 RS , the total\npower is LJet \u2248 1.3 1040 erg/s. From Eq. (10) we can estimate the turbulent energy dissipation rate along the jet\nto be 2.7 1039 ln(zout /zin )[(kout R)/50] erg/s. The inverted\npart of the spectrum of Sgr A\u2217 extends from 1 GHz to\n350 GHz and the ratio zout /zin must therefore be larger\n350. This provides a upper bound to the outer turbulent\nscale kout R < 24 so that the kinetic energy is not dissipated before reaching zout . The total jet power is 5 orders of magnitude larger than the emitted radio luminosity, which increases the required accretion rate to power\nthe jet. The brightness temperature of the model is little\nless than the equipatitition temperature and the inverse\nCompton luminosity from optical to X-rays is much less\nthan the radio luminosity. The radio jet of Sgr A\u2217 is a very\ninefficient radiation source. For the polarization in M81*\nwe would qualitatively obtain similar numbers, with however, a higher jet power.\n\n4.3. Jet Components in Quasars\nIn the bright jet sources 3C 84 and 3C 273 (Homan &\nWardle 1999) it has been demonstrated, that CP can be\ndetected in the core and the innermost jet component. The\ndegree of LP is equal or less than CP in the inverted spec-\n\n9\n\ntrum cores. Various other components show 0.5% circular\npolarization in these sources. For 3C 273 it is claimed, that\nthe circular polarization is predominately associated with\nnew ejected jet components. This has to be taken with\ncaution as Taylor (1998) reports a large rotation measure\nof RM = \u22121900 rad m\u22122 for the core of 3C 273 and almost\nequally large RM for the core of 3C 279. The reduced linear polarization in 3C 273 may therefore be due to depolarization in surrounding cold gas. They also report that\nthe component CW in 3C 279 is +1.2% circularly polarized, while the linear polarization of component CW is\n13% on average. A model for a typical jet component is\nshown in Fig. 7. In contrast to Sgr A* we have here less reduction of polarization due to turbulence (as we only look\nat one spatially resolved jet component) and less Faraday\ndepolarization. The model invokes a higher \u03b3min of order\n20 and a power law up to \u03b3max = 104 that produces emission well into the optically thin regime, which is known\nnot to exist in Sgr A*. This gives one the characteristic\nLP-to-CP ratio of \u223c 10 observed in quasars and recently\nalso in X-ray binaries (Fender et al. 2002).\nIt is also interesting to note that we can produce\nthe observed CP with a \u03b3min of order 20. This is somewhat higher than the rather low values found by Wardle\net al. (1998) and does not place quite so stringent constraints on the energy budget and the matter content of\nthe jet. Somewhat more realistic energy distributions at\nlow-energies other than a sharply cut-off power-law may\nfurther relief these constraints.\n\n5. Polarization Variability\nIn the presence of a turbulent magnetic field the degree\nof polarization (both circular and linear) and position angle will vary stochastically with a timescale \u2206t = \u2206z/vA .\nPolarization variability is expected to be faster than variations in total flux, because the relevant length-scale is the\n\u221a\n\u22121\nouter turbulent length-scale kout\n. With vA \u2248 cS \u2248 c/ 3\nwe get a characteristic variability time\n\u221a\n3R\n\u221d \u03bd \u2212(s+4)/(s+4+4a/3)\n(25)\n\u2206t =\nc(kout R)\nThe effective radius at a given frequency can be determined from a model for the total flux, while the turbulent scale can be derived from polarization of optically\nthin emission or estimated from the ratio h\u03c0L i / h\u03c0C i.\nTurbulence also leads to decorrelation of polarization and\nposition angle across frequency bands. Polarization prop\u22121\nerties from optical surfaces a distance kout\napart should\nbe uncorrelated. This translates into a relative distance\n\u2206z/z = sin \u03b8/(kout R) and both LP and CP should vary\nacross frequency bands \u2206\u03bd set by the turbulence in the\nsource\n\u0013\n\u0012\nsin \u03b8\na/3\n\u2206\u03bd\n= 1+\n(26)\n\u03bd\ns/4 + 1 kout R\nThe suggested model for Sgr A\u2217 with the Alfven velocity of vA = 2 109 cm/s and kout R = 24 implies a vari-\n\n\f10\n\nBeckert & Falcke: Circular Polarisation in Jets\n\nability timescale of \u2206t \u2248 16 h at 1 GHz and an accordingly shorter variability time scale at higher frequencies.\nThe decorrelation across frequency bands is expected at a\nwidth \u2206\u03bd/\u03bd \u2248 2.4 * 10\u22122 . Longer integration times than\nset by Eq. (25) and frequency bands wider than given by\nEq. (26) will produce smaller polarization measurements\nthan intrinsically available in the source.\n\n6. Discussion\nRecent observations of radio circular polarization in AGN,\nX-ray binaries, and the Galactic Centre black hole suggest\nthat CP at the 0.3%-1%-level is common to many selfabsorbed synchrotron sources. Faraday rotation and conversion in a magnetized and therefore bi-refringent plasma\nproduce enhanced circular and reduced linear polarization. Both processes are sensitive to the presence of lowenergy electrons and the orientation of the global magnetic\nfield.\nThe standard jet model for compact radio cores with a\nhelical plus a turbulent magnetic field can well reproduce\nthe circular and linear polarization spectrum of sources\nlike Sgr A* and M81* with their high CP-to-LP ratio.\nThe suppression of LP is achieved by the presence of a\nsignificant number of low-energy electrons in the source\nand an absence of an optically thin power-law extending\nto higher energies. The same model can also explain the\ntypical level of circular polarization in blazars and the\nCP-to-LP ratio observed in blazars and X-ray binary jets.\nIn this case a number of low-energy electrons is reduced\nwith respect to the Sgr A* model and a power-law in the\nelectron distribution exists.\nFor Sgr A* the number of low-energy electrons producing conversion and depolarization needs to be significantly\nhigher (by 2-3 orders of magnitude) than the number of\nradiating hot electrons. This means that a large fraction\nof the outflowing jet material is in the form of hidden\nmatter shielded by self-absorption. This increases the estimates of the total jet power, which can be 5 orders of\nmagnitude higher than the synchrotron luminosity. If one\npresumes that this power has to be provided by an accretion flow, the minimum accretion rates of 10\u22129..\u22128M\u2299 /yr,\npreviously estimated from \"maximally-efficient\" jet models for Sgr A* (Falcke et al. 1993; Falcke & Biermann\n1999) need to be raised to about 10\u22126 M\u2299 /yr. This is quite\nconsistent with recent estimates of Bondi-Hoyle accretion\nrates onto Sgr A* (Baganoff et al. 2002) and with suggestions for a coupled jet plus ADAF model (Yuan et al.\n2002), where the emission from the accretion disk is highly\nsuppressed with respect to the jet.\nIt is also interesting to note that to fit the CP with conversion one requires an asymmetry in the magnetic field\ncomponents. This is naturally achieved by a helical magnetic field as is presumed to exist in jets. A symmetric\nconfiguration, e.g. a tightly wound helix or even a toroidal\nmagnetic field structure would have difficulties to produce\nthe observed level of CP.\n\nThe stable handedness of CP over 20 years also implies a long-term stable component of the unidirectional\nfield along the line-of-sight. This indicates that the polarity of the magnetic field (the \"magnetic north pole\") has\nremained constant over the last two decades. In view of the\nrather short accretion time scale in Sgr A\u2217 one could also\nspeculate that this polarity is related to the accretion of a\nstable large-scale magnetic field which is accreted and expelled via the jet. The same can be said about blazars and\nX-ray binaries, where the stability found in GRS1915+105\nby Fender et al. (2002) is particularly interesting since the\nintrinsic accretion time scales in X-ray binaries are much\nshorter than those in supermassive black holes.\nAnother important aspect of CP measurements is the\nquestion of the matter content of jets. We find that the\nconstraints from CP of individual jet components for the\njet power in blazars are not quite as severe as previously claimed and a statement in support of a pure electron/positron jet has to viewed with caution. For Sgr A*\nor M81* the situation may be different. If the depolarization is indeed intrinsic to the jet and not a surrounding medium (Agol 2000, Quataert & Gruzinov 2000), one\nneeds a high Faraday optical depth in the source, which\ncan only be achieved by an excess of \"warm\" (1 <\n\u223c \u03b3 <\n\u223c\n100) electrons in an electron/proton plasma.\nWhile we have here assumed that all electrons are distributed in a single power-law, the actual situation may\nbe quite different. For Sgr A* a power-law is actually not\nneeded and we could obtain rather similar results with a\ntwo-temperature electron distribution, with temperatures\ncorresponding to \u03b3min and \u03b3max respectively. This is not\nquite possible in blazars or bright X-ray binary jets, where\nextended electron power-laws are directly observed in the\noptically thin regime. It could well be that the radiative inefficiency of Sgr A* is due to the lack of effective shock acceleration that would increase the number of high-energy\nelectrons with respect to the number of low-energy electrons (and in turn decrease the CP-to-LP ratio). The origin of these different electron distributions and their role\nfor the radio-loudness of jet sources should be a very exciting question for further research.\nBy improving our sensitivity and imaging all four\nStokes parameters at multiple frequencies in the future,\nit will be possible to construct models of the entire emission and transfer processes in the source and determine\nthe composition and energy spectrum of the relativistic\nplasma within jets.\n\nAppendix A: The Radiative Transfer Problem\nIn a weakly anisotropic medium the propagation of electromagnetic radiation is determined by the dielectric tensor \u01ebij .
