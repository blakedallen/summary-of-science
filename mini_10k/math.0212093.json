It was later shown by Davies [1] that the HelfferSj\u00f6strand formula had greater implications in spectral theory than it was originally intended for. He constructed a functional calculus for a much wider\nclass of operators on spaces other than Hilbert under certain assumptions on\nthe norms of the resolvents. He in addition showed that in the special case of\nself-adjoint operators this coincided with the classical functional calculus.\nWe show that we can widen the class of functions when we consider operators\nwith spectrums which are bounded below, since positive operators take special\ntreatment in the analysis of partial differential equations. The results enable\nexplicit tractable definitions of certain functions of partial differential operators in particular the Heat Semigroup.\nOur hypothesis in the pending analysis is\nH is a closed densely defined operator on a Banach space B, with spectrum\n\u03c3 (H) \u2282 R.
