For the first glance they distinguish photons from other particles (nucleons, electrons, etc.) for which these effects for a\nlong time have been considered nonexistent.\nIn [1-8] a wide range of phenom-ena similar to the effects of light polarization\nplane rotation and birefringence was shown to exist for particles other than\nphotons. In particular it has been shown that as particles (neutrons, protons,\nneutrinos, etc.) pass through matter with polarized nuclei, the particle spin\nundergoes a rotation in an effective pseudomagnetic field of the matter induced\nby both strong and weak interactions. This effect is kinematically analogous to\nthe phenomenon of light polarization plane rotation due to the Faraday effect.\nExperimentally, the effect of neutron spin precession in polarized target has\nbeen studied for neuterons [4-6].\nAs it was ascertained in [5-8] the analogue of birefringence phenomenon\nexists for particles, too.\nAs a matter of fact, the Faraday effect and the ef-fect of birefringence are\ncaused by the dependence of the coherent photon-medium interaction energy\non the photon spin state. This property unites the quasioptical phenomena\ndiscovered in [1-8] for interaction of spin-particles in matter with nuclei with\nthe phenomena existing in light optics. However, attention should be drawn\nto the fact that whereas the photon spin is equal to unity, the particle (atom,\nnucleus) spin may take on different values. For particles of spin S = 1/2 there\nexists only one effect - that of spin rotation, i.e. a kinematic analog of the effect\nof light polarization plane rotation. An effect similar to birefringence exists\nfor spin S \u2265 1 particles. It is very interesting to mention that phenomena of\nrotation and oscillations of particle spin (birefringence effect) exist for particles\nwith spin S \u2265 1 in a medium with unpolarized scatterer spins, too. The fact\nthat these effects are described by spin-dependent part of scattering amplitude\nallows to use them for the measurement of this amplitude at different energies\nof colliding particles.\n\n0.1\n\nSpin rotation of high-energy particles in polarized\ntargets.\n\nAs a result of numerous studies (see, for example, [12]), a close connection\nbetween the coherent elastic scattering amplitude f (0) and the refraction index\nof a medium N has been established:\n1\n\n\fN =1+\n\n2\u03c0\u03c1\nf (0)\nk2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the number of particles per cm3 , k is the wave number of a particle\nincident on a target. In 1964 it was shown [1] that while slow neutrons are\npropagating through the target with polarized nuclei a new effect of nucleon\nspin precession occured. It is stipulated by the fact that in a polarized target\nthe neutrons are characterized by two refraction indices (N\u2191\u2191 for neutrons with\nthe spin parallel to the target polarization vector and N\u2191\u2193 for neutrons with the\nopposite spin orientation , N\u2191\u2191 6= N\u2191\u2193 ). According to the [2], in the target with\npolarized nuclei there is a nuclear pseudomagnetic field and the interaction of\nan incident neutron with this field results in neutron spin rotation. The results\nobtained in [1], initiated experiments which proved the existence of this effect\n[9-11].\nThus, let us consider the amplitude of elastic coherent zero-angle scattering\nof nucleon by polarized nucleon (nucleous).\nThe general form of this amplitude with allowance for strong electromagnetic\nand weak interactions is given in [2]. Below we shall consider more concretely the\neffect of a relativistic nucleon spin rotation in the target with polarized protons\n(nuclei with spin 1/2), caused by strong interaction. In this case, the explicit\nstructure of the elastic scattering amplitude of a particle with spin 1/2 by a\nparticle with spin 1/2 (see, for example, [13, 14]) proceeds from the following\nsimple discussions. In our case, the elastic scattering amplitude at zero angle\ndepends on the spin operators 12 \u03c3, 12 \u03c31 of an incident particle and that of a\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2192\ntarget , and also on the momentum of the incident particle , that is, on \u2212\nn = kk\n\u2192\n. Operators \u2212\n\u03c3,\u2212\n\u03c3\u2192\n1 can be contained in the expression for the amplitude only in\n\u2192\n\u2192\nthe first degree, as higher degrees of \u2212\n\u03c3 reduce either to a number or to \u2212\n\u03c3 . The\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\ncombinations \u03c3 , \u03c31 and n must be such that the scattering amplitudes are a\nscalar and invariant in space and time reflections. These conditions defenetely\ndetermine its general form:\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192 \u2212\n\u2192 \u2212\n\u2192 \u2212\n\u2192\nFb = A + A1 (\u2212\n\u03c3 *\u2212\n\u03c3\u2192\n1 ) + A2 ( \u03c3 * n ) ( \u03c31 * n ) .\n\n(2)\n\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u03c3 *\u2212\np ) + A2 (\u2212\n\u03c3 *\u2212\nn ) (\u2212\nn *\u2212\np)\nf = Sp \u03c1s Fb = A + A1 (\u2212\n\n(3)\n\n\u2192\n\u2192\nf =A+\u2212\n\u03c3 *\u2212\ng\n\n(4)\n\nBy averaging the amplitude Fb with the help of a spin matrix of the density of\nscatters \u03c1s the elastic coherent scattering amplitude may be written as:\n\n\u2192\nwhere \u2212\np = Sp \u03c1s \u2212\n\u03c3\u2192\n1 is the polarization vector of a scatterer in a target.\nAmplitude f can be expressed as\n\n2\n\n\f\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\nn (\u2212\nn *\u2212\np ).\np + A2 \u2212\nwhere \u2212\ng = A1 \u2212\n\u2192\nTo simplify further reasoning let us consider the situation when vector \u2212\nn is\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\neither parallel to p ( n k p ) or perpendicular to p ( n \u22a5 p ).\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\nIn this case one has that g (\u2212\nn k\u2212\np ) = (A1 + A2 ) \u2212\np and g (\u2212\nn \u22a5\u2212\np) =\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\nA1 p .

Hence, the corresponding refractive indices\nare not equal to each other (i.e. N\u2191\u2191 6= N\u2191\u2193 ).\nConsidering a wave passes through a layer of polarized medium with finite\n\u2192\nthickness one can express refractive index of nuclon with spin parallel to \u2212\np as\nfollows:\nN\u2191\u2191 = 1 +\n\n2\u03c0\u03c1\n2\u03c0\u03c1\nf\u2191\u2191 = 1 + 2 (A + g)\nk2\nk\n\n(5)\n\nand for nucleon with opposite polarization\nN\u2191\u2193 = 1 +\n\n2\u03c0\u03c1\n2\u03c0\u03c1\nf\u2191\u2193 = 1 + 2 (A \u2212 g)\nk2\nk\n\n(6)\n\nthen the difference\n\u2206N = N\u2191\u2191 \u2212 N\u2191\u2193 =\n\n2\u03c0\u03c1\n4\u03c0\u03c1\n(f\u2191\u2191 \u2212 f\u2191\u2193 ) = 2 g\nk2\nk\n\n(7)\n\nis determined by the difference in correspondent coherent scattering amplitudes and differs from zero only in polarized medium.\nSuppose that nucleon passes through polarized medium and their polariza\u2192\ntions are oriented at certain angle to the vector \u2212\np .

This fact should be taken into consideration at particular analysis,\nbecause atom electrons can contribute to the rotation angle.\n4\n\n\fLet us consider proton beam passing through polarized gas hydrogen target.\nLet polarized atoms of hydrogen in magnetic field are described by the magnetic\nquantum number M = 1. It means that in hydrogen atom spins of proton and\nelectron are parallel. Polarized atoms of hydrogen possess magnetic moment\ndirected along spin, which produces magnetic field BH \u223c \u03c1 \u03bcH , where \u03c1 is the\nnumber of atoms of hydrogen in 1 cm3 , \u03bcH is the magnetic moment of hydrogen\natom. As the magnetic moment of proton is much less than that of electron,\nthen magnetic field BH of polarized hydrogen atoms is mainly produced by\ntheir electrons.\nHence the angle of rotation of proton spin can be expressed as a sum of two\nadditives \u03b8B and \u03b8S\n\u03b8 = \u03b8B + \u03b8S ,\nwhere \u03b8B is the angle of rotation caused by magnetic field and \u03b8S is the angle of\nrotation appearing due to strong interactions i.e. nuclear pseudomagnetic field.\nThus, considering rotation phenomena as a tool for experimental investigation of zero-angle nucleon-nucleon scattering amplitude one come to neccessity\n\u2212\n\u2192 \u2212\n\u2192 \u2212\u2192\nto extract addition caused by magnetic field of the target B = H + BH , here\n\u2212\n\u2192\nH is the external magnetic field. This can be done:\n1. by calculation using equations of Bargman-Michel-Telegdi (BMT) [14]\nas magnetic moments of proton and electron (hydrogen atom) are known with\nhigh accuracy\nor\n2. by experimental separating of additions caused by magnetic and nuclear\npseudomagnetic fields. This possibility is due to the fact that magnetic field\ninduced by polarized magnetic moment depends on the shape of the target\nbecause of long-distance action of electromagnetic interaction. Whereas the\nnuclear pseudomagnetic field (being short-range action) does not depend on the\nshape of the target.\nMoreover, from the analysis of BMT-equations follows that if proton velocity\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\nis directed along B then angle of rotation of proton spin orthogonal to B for\nnonrelativistic protons is determined by magnetic moment. If proton velocity is\n\u2212\n\u2192\northogonal to B than spin rotation in magnetic field is determined by anomalous\nmagnetic moment, since due to cyclotron movement of proton in magnetic field\nthe addition to the angle of rotation, caused by Dirac magnetic moment (equal\nto the nuclear magneton), yields to the conservation of angle between proton\nspin and momentum (if the anomalous magnetic moment \u2206\u03bc is equal to zero).\n\u2212\n\u2192\nHence the observed deviation of proton spin in magnetic field B is conditioned\nby \u2206\u03bc.\nLet us evaluate the effect magnitude for particular setup [15]. According\nto [15] target thickness is n = \u03c1l = 1014 atoms/cm2 , a revolution frequency of\nproton beam \u03bd \u223c 106 s\u22121 .\nFrom (14) we can obtain for rotation angle caused by nuclear pseudomagnetic\nfield :\n5\n\n\f\u03b8S\n\n=\n=\n\n\u0001\n2\u03c0\u03c1l\n4\u03c0 n\u03bdT\nNN\nNN\nRe f\u2191\u2191\n(0) \u2212 f\u2191\u2193\n(0) * \u03bdT =\nReg =\nk\nk\n4\u03c0h\u0304n\u03bdRegT \u223c\n4\u03c0n\u03bdT\nq\nReg = \u221a\n= 1 rad\n2ME\n2M\nE\n2\nh\u0304\n\n\u223c\nT is the observation time.

It should be reminded that Be = \u03b74\u03c0\u03c1\u03bce , where \u03b7 depends on the target shape (for example, for sphere \u03b7 = 32 ) [16].\n\u2192\nSuppose polarization vector \u2212\np is orthogonal to the particle momentum.

It is very important that in considered case (deuterons passing through\nnonpolarized medium) there are no magnetic fields at the target area.\n\u03c6=\n\nExperimental study of f (0) at different particle energies is an important tool\nfor investigation of particles interaction properties. Phenomena of spin rotation\nand oscillation, described above, give the basis for methods of investigation of\namplitude f (0) spin-dependendent part, examination of dispesion relations for\nit and testing of P-,T-violations at particle interactions for different energies. Of\nthe essence, interactions at final state make the measurement of T-odd contributions difficult at experimental studies of T-violation by scattering of particles\nby each other. This problem is absent for T-odd particle spin rotation due to\nrefraction, because it is determined by the elastic coherent zero-angle scattering\namplitude. In this case initial and final states of target coincides and the above\ndifficulty does not occur. As a result, methods based on the measurement of\nspin rotation angle (and f (0) measurement, as a sequence) can provide the most\ntight restrictions to the possible value of T-odd interactions.\nOne more promising aria of experimental investigations can be mentined,\nwhere phenomena, caused by nuclear optics of polarized medium, can appear\nefficient. Storage rings become now the more and more important investigation\ntool. Life-time of particle beam in storage ring can reach several hours and\neven days. During this time particles circulate in storage ring with frequency\nof several MHz and even small spin-dependent interactions of beams with each\nother can significantly influence on polarization state of beams.\nWe considered the rest target above. But in storage rings moving bunch is\nusually used as a target. No problems appear at study of spin rotation effect in\nthis case - you should consider the effect in the rest frame of one of the beams\nand then reduce the result to the laboratory frame.\nAs an example let us consider cross-collision of two bunches of polarized\nparticles. Suppose particles of the first beam have mass m1 , energy E1 and\nLorentz factor \u03b31 , whereas particles of the second beam are characterized by\nmass m2 , energy E2 and Lorentz factor \u03b32 . Choose the frame where the second\nbeam rest. In this frame the energy of the particles of the first beam E1\u2032 =\nE1 \u03b32 = m1 c2 \u03b31 \u03b32 .

Lorentz factor of particle 1 in rest frame of\nparticle 2 is \u03b3 = \u03b31 \u03b32 and this factor can be educed in scattering amplitude:\nf (E1\u2032 , 0) = \u03b31 \u03b32 f \u2032 (E1\u2032 , 0). As a result:\n\u03b8\u2032 = 2\u03c0\u03c12 \u03bb1c Re f\n\n\u2032\n\u2191\u2191\n\n(E1\u2032 , 0) \u2212 Re f\n\nwhere \u03bb1c = h/m1 c.\n\n\u2032\n\u2191\u2193\n\n\u0001\n(E1\u2032 , 0) l,\n\nAngle of rotation is invariant. Then in laboratory frame it will be the same.\nEvidently, particles 2 also experience refraction on the bunch 1. As a result\nmutual rotation of polarizatuion vectors of both bunches occurs. Taking into\nconsideration the fact that in storage ring particle passes through the target\n(bunch) many times one can see that total angle of spin rotation, caused by\nrefraction, many times rises. The above makes measurement of zero-angle scattering amplitude in wide particle energy range very promising.\nVery interesting possibility appears when one of the beams (e.g. beam 2) has\nvery low energy. It can be beam of ultracold atoms. Then index of refraction of\nbeam 2 by beam 1 is high and we can apply atom interferometry methods for\nscattering amplitude measurement.\nIt should be mentioned that unique possuibility to measure spin-independent\nzero-angle scattering amplitude at high energies also appears.\nIt is important to note that photon beam formed by laser wave can be used\nas one of the beams. In this case effect of spin rotation is determined by elastic\ncoherent amplitude of zero-angle scattering of particle by photon. According\nto the above analysis both electromagnetic and P-,T- odd weak interactions\ncontribute to the refration index of particle in the area occupied by photons [17].\nAs a result area occupied by photons can be described as optically anisotropic\nmedium.\n\nReferences\n[1] V.G.
