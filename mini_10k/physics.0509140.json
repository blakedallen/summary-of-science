This feature has\nbecome more and more central during the last decade\nthrough the concept of discrete breathers [1, 2, 3]. In classical anharmonic lattices, discrete breathers correspond\nto time-periodic and spatially localized solutions which\nresult from the interplay between the discreteness and\nthe nonlinearity. These solutions do not require integrability for their existence and stability and it has been\nsuggested that they should correspond to quite general\nand robust solutions. Since discrete breathers yield a local accumulation of the vibrational energy which might\nbe pinned in the lattice or may travel through it, they\nare expected to be of fundamental importance.\nAt present, because the occurrence of classical\nbreathers is a relatively well understood phenomena, a\ngreat attention is done to characterize their quantum\nequivalent for which less numerous results are known\n[4]. In that context, bound states involving two high frequency vibrational excitons, also called two-vibron bound\nstates (TVBS), play a central role. When two vibrons are\nexcited, the vibrational anharmonicity is responsible for\nthe trapping of the two quanta over only a few sites with\na resulting energy which is lesser than the energy of two\nquanta lying far apart. The lateral interaction yields a\nmotion of such a state from one site to another, thus\nleading to the occurrence of a delocalized wave packet\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: vincent.pouthier@univ-fcomte.fr\n\nwith a well-defined momentum. As a result, TVBS are\nthe first quantum states which experience the nonlinearity and can thus be viewed as the quantum counterpart\nof breathers or soliton excitations [5, 6, 7, 8].\nThe present paper is thus devoted to the characterization of the TVBS associated to the amide-I vibrations\nin a 3D \u03b1-helix. Since the pionneer work of Davydov\n[9, 10], the delocalization of amide-I vibrations yields the\noccurrence of vibrons which are expected to play a fundamental role for the transport of the energy released by the\nhydrolysis of adenosine triphophate [11, 12]. More precisely, the energy transfer is achieved by small polarons\nwhich originate in the strong coupling between the vibrons and the phonons of the helix [13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. A\nsmall polaron corresponds to a vibron dressed by a virtual cloud of phonons describing a localized lattice distortion which follows instantaneously the vibron.\nIn the paper I of this series, the single-vibron states\nin a 3D model of an \u03b1-helix [18] have been characterized. It has been shown that the vibron dynamics results from the competition between two kinds of hopping processes. The first kind refers to vibrational transitions between different spines whereas the second kind\ninvolves vibron hops along the same spine. This study\nhas revealed that several parameters such as the temperature, the small polaron binding energy and the helix\nbackbone conformation, allow for a transition between\ntwo regimes. At low temperature or weak small polaron\nbinding energy, the polaron behaves as an undressed vibron delocalized between the different spines. By contrast, at biological temperature or strong small polaron\nbinding energy, the dressing effect strongly reduces the\nvibrational exchanges between different spines so that the\npolaron tends to propagate along a single spine, only. Although the phonon spectrum exhibits both an acoustic\nbranch and an optical branch, it has been shown that the\n\n\f2\nprevious features originate in the coupling between the\nvibrons and the acoustic phonons.\nIn recent works [19, 20], TVBS have been studied\nwithin the 1D model of an \u03b1-helix in which the vibron\ndynamics is reduced to that of a single spine of hydrogenbound peptide unit. In that case, it has been shown that\nboth the intramolecular anharmonicity of each amide-I\nvibration and the strong vibron-phonon interaction act as\nnonlinear sources which break the vibron independence\nand favor the formation of two kinds of bound states.\nIn the harmonic situation, the two bound states appear\nas combinations of states involving the trapping of the\ntwo vibrons onto the same amide-I mode and onto nearest neighbor amide-I modes in a given spine. By contrast, the intramolecular anharmonicity reduces the hybridization between these two kinds of trapping so that\nthe low frequency bound state refers to the trapping of\nthe two vibrons onto the same amide-I mode whereas\nthe high frequency bound state characterizes the trapping onto nearest neighbor amide-I vibrations in a given\nspine. These results were corroborated by the pumpprobe spectroscopy experiment of the N-H mode in a\nstable \u03b1-helix which has revealed the two excited state\nabsorption bands connected to the two kinds of bound\nstates [21, 22].\nThe present paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II,\nthe model to describe the vibron-phonon dynamics in 3D\n\u03b1-helices is introduced. Then, the procedure to remove\nthe intramolecular anharmonicity and to renormalize the\nvibron-phonon interaction in order to obtain the dressed\nanharmonic vibron Hamiltonian is summarized. Finally,\nthe number states method used to solve the two-vibron\nSchrodinger equation is outlined. In Sec. III, a detailed\nanalysis of the two-vibron energy spectrum is performed\ndepending on the values taken by the relevant parameters\nof the problem. The results are discussed and interpreted\nin Sec. IV.\n\nII.\n\nTHEORETICAL BACKGROUND\n\nAs pointed out in the introduction, the two-vibron dynamics is strongly sensitive to the nonlinear nature of\nthe vibron-phonon system. In \u03b1-helices, this nonlinearity originates from both the intramolecular anharmonicity of each amide-I vibration and from the strong vibronphonon coupling . In the present section, we thus briefly\nsummarize the model described in paper I [18] and introduce the anharmonic nature of each amide-I mode according to the 1D model detailed in Ref. [19].\n\nthe polypeptide chain is stabilized by the hydrogen bonds\nbetween the residues n and n + 3. The resulting conformation is a 3D \u03b1-helix in which each residue is related\nto the next one by a translation of h = 1.5 \u00c5 and by a\nrotation of \u03b80 = 100o leading to 3.6 residues per turn of\nhelix. The N residues are assumed to behave as pointlike entities which the equilibrium positions are located\non sites distributed along the helix which the radius is\nfixed to R0 = 2.8 \u00c5 [10]. The geometry of the helix is\nthus specified in the (xyz) cartesian frame where the z\ndirection is parallel to the axis of the helix (see Fig. 1a\nin paper I [18]).\nThe nth site contains a amide-I vibration which behaves as an internal high frequency oscillator described\nby the standard creation and annihilation vibron operators b+\nn and bn . By introducing the intramolecular anharmonicity of each amide-I mode, the vibron Hamiltonian\nis written as (within the convention ~=1)\nX\nHv =\n\u03c90 b\u2020n bn + \u03b33 (b\u2020n + bn )3 + \u03b34 (b\u2020n + bn )4 + ...\nn\n\n1 XX\n\u2212\nJ(n \u2212 n\u2032 )(b\u2020n + bn )(b\u2020n\u2032 + bn\u2032 )\n2 n \u2032\n\nwhere \u03c90 stands for the internal frequency of the nth\namide-I mode and where J(n \u2212 n\u2032 ) denotes the lateral\nhopping constant between the residues n and n\u2032 . In\nEq.(1), \u03b33 and \u03b34 represent the cubic and quartic anharmonic parameters of each amide-I mode.\nThe amide-I vibrations interact with the phonons of\nthe helix which corresponds to the dynamics of the external motions of the residues. As detailed in paper\nI [18], this dynamics is expressed in N local frames\n(er (n), e\u03b8 (n), ez (n)) attached to each residue (see Fig.\n1b in paper I [18]) so that the displacement of the nth\nresidue in the nth local frame corresponds to a Bloch\nwave with wave vector k [24]. Therefore, the normal\nmode decomposition is achieved by performing the diagonalization of a (3 \u00d7 3) dynamical matrix D(k) for\neach k value. Such a procedure allows us to define three\neigenvalues \u03a92k\u03c3 and three eigenvectors \u01ebk\u03c3 labeled by the\nindex \u03c3 = 1, 2, 3 associated to the 3D nature of the helix. The two indexes k and \u03c3 specify a particular phonon\nmode with energy ~\u03a9k\u03c3 , quasi-momentum ~k and polarization \u01ebk\u03c3 . The quantum dynamics of each mode is\ndescribed by the creation a\u2020k\u03c3 and annihilation ak\u03c3 operators so that the phonon Hamiltonian is written as (within\nthe convention ~ = 1)\nHp =\n\nX\nk\u03c3\n\nA.\n\nHelix structure and model Hamiltonian\n\nLet us consider a sequence of N amino acid units\n(called residues) regularly distributed along a polypeptide chain and let n the index which labels the position\nof the nth residue. In three dimension, the structure of\n\n(1)\n\nn\n\n1\n\u03a9k\u03c3 (a\u2020k\u03c3 ak\u03c3 + )\n2\n\n(2)\n\nFinally, according to the Davydov model, the vibronphonon interaction originates in the modulation of the\nvibrational frequency of each amide-I vibration by the\nexternal motion of the residues. Within the deformation potential approximation, the vibron-phonon coupling Hamiltonian is written in terms of the phonon nor-\n\n\f3\ncorrection \u03b7 = 120(\u03b33 /\u03c90 )2 \u2212 12\u03b34 /\u03c90 as\n\nmal mode coordinates as\n\u2206Hvp =\n\nX \u2206k\u03c3\n\u2206\u2217\ne\u2212ikn a\u2020k\u03c3 + k\u03c3 eikn ak\u03c3 )(b\u2020n +bn )2 (3)\n(\n2\n2\nk\u03c3\n\nwhere \u2206k\u03c3 , which accounts for the modulation of the\nfrequency of the nth amide-I vibration due to its coupling\nwith the phonon mode specified by the wave vector k and\nthe index \u03c3, is expressed as\n\u2206k\u03c3\n\nX \u03c7|m| Ck (m)\u01eb\u2217k\u03c3\n\u221a\n=\n2M N ~\u03a9k\u03c3\nm\n\n(4)\n\nIn Eq.(4), \u03c7|n\u2212n\u2032 | denotes the strength of the interaction\nbetween the nth amide-I mode and the external displacement of the n\u2032 th residue and Ck (m) is a vector which\naccount for the helix geometry and which is defined in\nEq.(16) of paper I [18].\n\nB.\n\nEffective Hamiltonian for the two-vibron\ndynamics\n\nThe vibron-phonon dynamics is described by the full\nHamiltonian H = Hv + Hp + \u2206Hvp which cannot be\nsolved exactly due to the nonlinear sources. Nevertheless, as detailed in Ref. [19] and outlined in paper I, it\ncan be expressed in an improved way by performing two\nunitary transformations. First, by following Kimball et\nal. [6], a unitary transformation is applied to remove\nthe intramolecular anharmonicity of each amide-I mode.\nThen, a modified Lang-Firsov transformation is realized\nto renormalize a part of the vibron-phonon interaction\n[25]. Finally, a mean field procedure is applied to separate the vibron degrees of freedom from the phonon coordinates in the residual coupling so that the effective\ndressed anharmonic vibron Hamiltonian is written as\n\u0124ef f =\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\nX1\nnn\u2032\n\nX\nnn\u2032\n\nX\nnn\u2032\n\nX\nnn\u2032\n\n2\n\nX\nn\n\n+2 2\n\u03c9\u03020 b+\nn bn \u2212 \u00c2bn bn\n\n+\nB\u0302(n \u2212 n\u2032 )b+\nn bn\u2032 bn bn\u2032\n\nJ1 (n \u2212 n\u2032 )\u03a6nn\u2032 (Nn + Nn\u2032 )b+\nn bn\u2032\n2\nJ2 (n \u2212 n\u2032 )\u03a6nn\u2032 (Nn + Nn\u2032 )4 b+2\nn bn\u2032\n\nJ3 (n \u2212 n\u2032 )\u03a6nn\u2032 (Nn + Nn\u2032 )b+\nn [Nn + Nn\u2032 ]bn\u2032(5)\n\nwhere the different parameters enter Eq.(5) are expressed in terms of the intramolecular anharmonicity\nA = 30\u03b332 /\u03c90 \u22126\u03b34 , the generalized small polaron binding\nP\n|2\ncos(kn) and the anharmonic\nenergy EB (n) = k\u03c3 |\u2206\u03a9k\u03c3\nk\u03c3\n\n\u03c9\u03020 = \u03c90 \u2212 2A \u2212 \u03a3n B(n)/2 \u2212 (1 + 4\u03b7)EB (0)\n\u00c2 = A + (1 + 8\u03b7)EB (0)\n\nB\u0302(n)\nB(n)\nJ1 (n)\nJ2 (n)\nJ3 (n)\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nB(n) + 2(1 + 4\u03b7)EB (n)\n144J(n)(\u03b33 /\u03c90 )2\nJ(n)(1 + 44(\u03b33 /\u03c90 )2 \u2212 12\u03b34 /\u03c90 )\n4J(n)(\u03b33 /\u03c90 )2\nJ(n)(22(\u03b33 /\u03c90 )2 \u2212 12\u03b34 /\u03c90 )\n\n(6)\n\nIn Eq.(5), \u03a6nn\u2032 (X) = exp(\u2212S(n \u2212 n\u2032 , T )[1 + 2\u03b7 + 2\u03b7X])\nwhere S(n, T ) is the coupling constant defined as (kB\ndenotes the Boltzmann constant)\nS(n, T ) =\n\nX \u2206k\u03c3\n~\u03a9k\u03c3\n|\n|2 coth(\n)(1 \u2212 cos(kn))\n\u03a9k\u03c3\n2kB T\n\n(7)\n\nk\u03c3\n\nAs clearly shown in Eq.(5), the nonlinear sources\nstrongly modify the dynamics of the dressed anharmonic\nvibrons. They are first responsible for a redshift of each\namide-I frequency, i.e. \u03c90 \u2192 \u03c9\u02c60 . Then, they lead to the\noccurrence of coupling terms which break the vibron in2\n\u2032 + +\ndependence. The terms \u00c2b+2\nn bn and B\u0302(n \u2212 n )bn bn\u2032 bn bn\u2032\nyield an attractive interaction between two vibrons and\nfavor their trapping around neighboring amide-I sites.\nFinally, the nonlinearities modify the vibron hopping processes via the dressing effect which reduces the hopping\nconstants connecting two sites n and n\u2032 according to the\ndressing function \u03a6nn\u2032 . Note that the contributions proportional to J2 characterize hops in the course of which\ntwo vibrons realize simultaneously a transition whereas\nthe terms proportional to J3 affect single-vibron hops\nfrom states formed by two vibrons located onto the same\namide-I vibration. These two latter mechanism are specific of the two-vibron dynamics and do not occur in the\nsingle-vibron dynamics. At this step let us mention that\nthe 3D nature of the helix provides a site dependent small\npolaron binding energy EB (n) as well as a site dependent\ncoupling constant S(n \u2212 n\u2032 , T ). As it will be discussed in\nthe following section, these two features discriminate between interspine and intraspine processes for both vibron\nhops and vibron-vibron interactions.\nTo characterize the two-vibron dynamics, the corresponding Schrodinger equation \u0124ef f | \u03a8i = \u03c9 | \u03a8i has\nto be solved. Since the Hamiltonian \u0124ef f (Eq.(5)) conserves the number of vibrons, this can be achieved by\nusing the number states method [8] which was successfully applied to molecular adsorbates [26, 27, 28] and 1D\nmodel of \u03b1-helices [19, 20]. Within this method, the twovibron wave function is expanded as\nX\n| \u03a8i =\n\u03a8(n1 , n2 ) | n1 , n2 )\n(8)\nn1 ,n2 \u2265n1\n\nwhere {| n1 , n2 )} denotes a local basis set normalized\nand symmetrized according to the restricting n2 \u2265 n1\nand where a particular vector | n1 , n2 ) characterizes two\n\n\f4\nvibrons located onto the sites n1 and n2 , respectively.\nThis basis set generates the entire two-vibron subspace\nwhich the dimension N (N + 1)/2 represents the number\nof ways for distributing two indistinguishable quanta onto\nN sites.\nThe Schrodinger equation can be expressed in an improved way by taking advantage of the helix symmetry.\nIndeed, as for the phonon dynamics, the two-vibron wave\nfunction is invariant under a rotation by an angle of \u03b80\naround the helix axis followed by a translation along this\naxis by a distance h. As a result, it can be expanded as\na Bloch wave as\n1 X iK(n1 +m/2)\ne\n\u03a8K (m) (9)\n\u03a8(n1 , n2 = n1 + m) = \u221a\nN n1\nwhere the total momentum K, which takes N values belonging to the first Brillouin zone of the helix, is associated to the motion of the center of mass of the two\nvibrons. Therefore, the resulting wave function \u03a8K (m)\nrefers to the degree of freedom m which characterizes\nthe distance between the two vibrons along the helix.\nSince the momentum K is a good quantum number, the\nHamiltonian Hef f appears as block diagonal and the\nSchrodinger equation can be solved for each K value.\nThis procedure, achieved numerically, allows us to defined a set of two-vibron eigenenergies \u03c9K\u03bb and a set of\ntwo-vibron eigenstates \u03a8K\u03bb (m) which are specified by\nthe index \u03bb = 1, ..., (N + 1)/2 for each K value.\nIn the following section, this procedure is illustrated\nto characterize the two-vibron energy spectrum of a 3D\n\u03b1-helix.\n\nIII.\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nTo describe the vibron dynamics in 3D \u03b1-helices, the\nhopping constant along the hydrogen bonds is fixed to\nJ(3) = 7.8 cm\u22121 [11, 16] whereas the hopping constants between different spines of hydrogen-bonded peptide units, calculated in Ref. [29] are equal to J(1) =\n\u221212.4 cm\u22121 and J(2) = 3.9 cm\u22121 . The other elements\nof the hopping matrix, rather small, are listed in the Table I of Ref. [29]. The harmonic frequency is fixed to\n\u03c90 = 1695 cm\u22121 and the anharmonic constant is equal\nto A = 8.0 cm\u22121 [19, 30, 31]. The cubic and quartic\nanharmonic parameters can be expressed approximately\nby using the relation 15\u03b332 /\u03c90 \u2248 6\u03b34 \u2248 A [19]. Note that\nthese parameter values are in a rather good agreement\nwith recent ab initio calculations [32].\nAs discussed in paper I [18], the harmonic dynamics of\nthe phonons is essentially governed by the force constant\nK|n\u2212n\u2032 | which refers to the second derivative of the pair\npotential connecting the two residues located onto the\nsites n and n\u2032 . The force constant K2 is set to zero and\nwe assume K|n| = 0 for n \u2265 4. The force constant of the\nhydrogen bonds is fixed to K3 = 15 Nm\u22121 [11, 16, 19, 20,\n23] whereas the force constant of the covalent bonds is\n\nequal to K1 = 60 Nm\u22121 [23]. Finally, the mass M which\nenters the phonon dynamics has been fixed to 2.0 10\u221225\nkg. The strength of the vibron-phonon coupling Eq.(3)\nis given by the parameters \u03c7|n\u2212n\u2032 | [18] which accounts\nfor the modulation of the nth amide-I frequency due to\nthe external motion of the n\u2032 th residue. According to the\n1D Davydov model, the parameter \u03c73 ranges between 35\nand 62 pN and we choose \u03c72 = 0 whereas we treat \u03c71 as\na parameter smaller than \u03c73 [23]. Note that \u03c7n = 0 for\nn \u2265 4.\nThe two-vibron energy spectrum is shown in Figs. 1\nfor T = 5 K, \u03c71 = 25 pN and \u03c73 = 50 pN (EB (0) = 8.9\ncm\u22121 ). The spectrum, centered onto the corrected frequency 2\u03c9\u03020 (Eq.(6)), describes the two-vibron dispersion\ncurves drawn in half of the first Brillouin zone of the helix, i.e. 0 < K < \u03c0. In the harmonic approximation,\ni.e. A = 0 (Fig. 1a), the spectrum exhibits an energy\ncontinuum located around 2\u03c9\u03020 with a bandwidth equal\nto 101.9 cm\u22121 . This continuum contains the states describing two independent vibrons and called two-vibron\nfree states (TVFS) [19]. For a given K value, a free state\nrefers to two independent vibrons with wave vectors q1\nand q2 and energy \u03c9q1 and \u03c9q2 so that K = q1 + q2 and\n\u03c9K\u03bb = \u03c9q1 +\u03c9q2 . Below the continuum, the spectrum exhibits two bands connected to two different bound states.\nThe low frequency band, located below the TVFS over\nthe entire Brillouin zone, refers to bound states called\nTVBS-I. The binding energy of TVBS-I, i.e. the gap between the zero wave vector TVBS-I and the bottom of the\nTVFS continuum, is equal to 4.8 cm\u22121 whereas its bandwidth is about 24.0 cm\u22121 . The second band, which refers\nto bound states denoted TVBS-II, lies below the continuum in a wave vector window which ranges between\nK = 0.5 and K = 0.9. When the anharmonic parameter\nis set to A = 8 cm\u22121 (Fig. 1b), the shape of the TVFS\ncontinuum does not exhibit any significant modification.\nNote that the center of the continuum is redshifted due\nto the dependence of 2\u03c9\u03020 (Eq.(6)) on the anharmonic\nparameter A (not drawn in the figure). Nevertheless,\nthe TVFS bandwidth is slightly reduced to 100.0 cm\u22121\nso that the wave vector window for the occurrence of\nthe TVBS-II opens and ranges between K = 0.4 and\nK = 1.0. By contrast, the anharmonicity strongly modifies the TVBS-I properties. It is responsible for a strong\nredshift of the band as well as for a decrease of the bandwidth. The TVBS-I binding energy reaches 15.3 cm\u22121\nwhereas the bandwidth is reduced to 19.0 cm\u22121 .\nFigs. 2 displays the TVBS wave function \u03a8K\u03bb (m) corresponding to the situation described in Figs. 1. Figures\n2a and 2b show the zero wave vector TVBS-I wave function for A = 0 and A = 8 cm\u22121 , respectively. The same\ncurves are presented in figures 2c and 2d but for a wave\nvector equal to K = 0.69. The TVBS-I wave function\nis described by open squares whereas the TVBS-II wave\nfunction is represented by open circles. When K = 0, the\nspectrum supports a single bound state, namely TVBS-I\n(Figs. 1). When A = 0 (Fig. 2a), the TVBS-I wave\nfunction is maximum when m = 0 and slightly decreases\n\n\f5\n\n60\n40\n\nFIG. 1: Two-vibron energy spectrum for\nT = 5 K, \u03c71 = 25 pN, \u03c73 = 50 pN and\nfor (a) A = 0 and (b) A = 8 cm\u22121 .\nThe spectrum is centered onto the corrected frequency 2\u03c9\u03020 and corresponds to\nthe two-vibron dispersion curves drawn\nin half of the first Brillouin zone of the\nhelix, i.e. 0 < K < \u03c0.\n\n\u03c9K \u03bb (cm-1)\n\n20\n0\n-20\n-40\n-60\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n-80\n\n\u03a8K \u03bb(m)\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\nK\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n30\n\n0.5\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n1\n\n1.5\nK\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18\nm\nm\n\nFIG. 2: TVBS wave function \u03a8K\u03bb (m) for T = 5 K, \u03c71 = 25\npN, \u03c73 = 50 pN.

It exhibits oscillations and takes significant values for m = 1 and m = 3 whereas it almost vanishes when\nm = 2. When the anharmonicity is set to A = 8 cm\u22121\n(Fig. 2b), the maximum in m = 0 is reinforced whereas\nthe extension of the wave function has been reduced. In\nother words, such a state refers to two vibrons trapped\naround the same amide-I vibration. However, whatever\nthe anharmonicity, the wave function shows a 3D character so that the bound state extends over the three spines\nof the helix. When K = 0.69, Figs. 1 clearly shows that\nthe energy spectrum supports both TVBS-I and TVBSII. The TVBS-I wave function appears strongly localized\nonto m = 0 and exhibits basically the same features as\nwhen K = 0 (Figs. 2c and 2d). By contrast, the TVBS-\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nII wave function vanishes in m = 0. It is maximum in\nm = 3 and decreases as the separating distance between\nthe two vibrons increases or decreases from m = 3 (Figs.\n2c and 2d). Such a state refers to two vibrons trapped\naround two nearest neighbor amide-I vibrations in a given\nspine. Nevertheless, the TVBS-II wave function shows a\n3D character so that the three spines of the helix are\ninvolved in the extension of the bound state.\nIn Figs. 3, the two-vibron energy spectrum is illustrated for T = 310 K and for the same set of parameters\nused in Figs. 1. Whatever the anharmonicity, the increase of the temperature strongly modifies the nature\nof the TVFS continuum. It appears symmetrically distributed around 2\u03c9\u02c60 with a bandwidth which has been\nstrongly reduced. It is equal to 33.4 cm\u22121 when A = 0\n(Fig. 3a) whereas it reaches 30.5 cm\u22121 when A = 8\ncm\u22121 (Fig. 3b). As in Figs. 1, the TVBS-I lies below the continuum over the entire Brillouin zone. However, its binding energy increases at biological temperature whereas the corresponding bandwidth decreases. In\nthe harmonic situation, i.e. A = 0 (Fig. 3a), the TVBS-I\nbinding energy is equal to 9.7 cm\u22121 and the bandwidth\nis equal to 8.4 cm\u22121 . When the anharmonicity is fixed to\nA = 8 cm\u22121 (Fig. 3b), the binding energy reaches 25.9\ncm\u22121 whereas the bandwidth decreases to 3.6 cm\u22121 . As\nshown in Figs. 3, the spectrum displays now two wave\nvector windows for the occurrence of the TVBS-II. For\nA = 0 (Fig. 3a), a first wave vector window appears in\nthe range K = 0.7 and K = 1.4 and a second window\ntakes place at the end of the first Brillouin zone, i.e. for\nK > 2.7. As previously, as when the anharmonicity is\nincreased, the range of these two windows increases (Fig.\n3b) so that the TVBS-II band clearly tends to get out of\nthe continuum.\nThe corresponding TVBS wave functions are illustrated in Figs. 4 for A = 0 (Figs. 4a and 4c) and\nA = 8 cm\u22121 (Fig. 4b and 4d). When K = 0 (Figs. 4a\nand 4b), the spectrum supports the TVBS-I band, only.\n\n\f6\n\n20\n10\n\n\u03c9K \u03bb (cm-1)\n\n0\n-10\n\nFIG. 3: Two-vibron energy spectrum for\nT = 310 K, \u03c71 = 25 pN, \u03c73 = 50 pN and\nfor (a) A = 0 and (b) A = 8 cm\u22121 .\n\n-20\n-30\n-40\n-50\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n-60\n\n\u03a8K \u03bb(m)\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\nK\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n30\n\n0.5\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n1\n\n1.5\nK\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18\nm\nm\n\nFIG. 4: TVBS wave function \u03a8K\u03bb (m) for T = 310 K, \u03c71 = 25\npN, \u03c73 = 50 pN.

When the anharmonicity increases, the maximum in m = 0 is reinforced\nand the extension of the wave function is reduced. In\nother words, at biological temperature, the two vibrons\nare confined in a given spine and are trapped around\nthe same amide-I mode. When K = \u03c0/3 (Figs. 4c and\n4d), Figs. 3 clearly show that the spectrum supports\nboth TVBS-I and TVBS-II. The TVBS-I wave function\nis strongly localized onto m = 0 and almost vanishes for\nthe other m values. By contrast, the TVBS-II wave function is clearly localized onto m = 3 so that it refers to\ntwo vibrons strongly trapped onto two nearest neighbors\namide-I modes belonging to the same spine. Note that\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nthe anharmonicity does not modify significantly the nature of the wave function of both TVBS-I and TVBS-II.\nFinally, the two-vibron energy spectrum is illustrated\nin Figs. 5 for T = 310 K, \u03c71 = 37.5 pN and \u03c73 = 75.0 pN\n(EB (0) = 20.0 cm\u22121 ). In that case, the strong vibronphonon coupling is responsible for a drastic decrease of\nthe TVFS bandwidth. As in Figs. 3, the anharmonicity enhances the decrease of the bandwidth which varies\nfrom 13.3 cm\u22121 for A = 0 (Fig. 5a) to 11.2 cm\u22121 for\nA = 8 cm\u22121 (Fig. 5b). As previously, the spectrum exhibits a TVBS-I band located below the continuum. The\nanharmonicity reduces the corresponding bandwidth and\nyields a strong redshift of the band. However, the main\ndifference when compared with the two previous cases is\ntwofold. First, the dressing effect is strong enough to induce the occurrence of the TVBS-II band over the entire\nBrillouin zone, even when A = 0 (Fig. 5a). The anharmonicity increases the TVBS-II binding energy and\nreduces its bandwidth. Then, a third bound state band,\ncalled TVBS-III, occurs below the TVFS continuum. Although it does not appear clearly on the figure, this band\nlies below the continuum over the entire Brillouin zone.\nIn a marked contrast with the two previous bound states,\nthe TVBS-III binding energy decreases as when the anharmonicity increases since it varies from 0.08 cm\u22121 when\nA = 0 (Fig. 5a) to 0.076 cm\u22121 when A = 8 cm\u22121 (Fig.\n5b). By contrast, the TVBS-III bandwidth decreases\nwith A. It is equal to 5.59 cm\u22121 when A = 0 (Fig. 5a)\nand reaches 4.94 cm\u22121 when A = 8 cm\u22121 (Fig. 5b).\nIn the latter situation corresponding to a strong dressing effect, we have verified that for both the TVBS-I and\nthe TVBS-II, the two vibrons are confined in a given\nspine. TVBS-I refers to their trapping onto the same\namide-I mode (m = 0) whereas TVBS-II characterizes\ntheir trapping onto two nearest neighbor amide-I modes\n(m = 3) located in the same spine (the wave functions\nare not drawn).

By contrast, when K = \u03c0/3 (Figs. 6c\nand 6d), the wave function appears strongly localized\nonto m = 1, only. These features indicate that TVBSIII refers to vibrons trapped onto neighboring amide-I\nmodes belonging to two different spines. More precisely,\nwhen the TVBS-III binding energy is rather weak, for instance when K = \u03c0/4, the bound state is extended and\nthe two vibrons are trapped over a large distance but belong to two different spines. By contrast, the TVBS-III\ntends to localized when its binding energy increases so\nthat it refers to vibrons trapped onto two nearest neighbor amide-I modes belonging to two different spines.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nTo interpret and discuss the previous results, let us\nfirst focus our attention onto the influence of the nonlinear sources, i.e. the intramolecular anharmonicity and\nthe strong vibron-phonon coupling. As shown in Figs.\n1, 3 and 5, the intramolecular anharmonicity is responsible for a decrease of the TVFS bandwidth, typically of\nabout a few wave numbers. This feature originates in\nthe modification of the hopping constants due to both\nthe anharmonicity and the dressing effect. Indeed, a\nTVFS corresponds to two independent vibrons moving\naccording to the effective hopping constants Jef f (n) =\nJ1 (n)exp[\u2212(1 + 4\u03b7)S(n, T )] which differ from the constants involved in the harmonic approximation. Basically, the intramolecular anharmonicity reinforces the\nrole played by the coupling constant S(n, T ) which characterizes the dressing effect (S(n, T ) \u2192 (1 + 4\u03b7)S(n, T )).\nTherefore, it enhances the dressing effect and favors a\ndecrease of the effective hopping constants so that anharmonic vibrons are more sensitive to the dressing effect than harmonic vibrons. Note that as when the temperature is increased, the strength of the dressing effect\nincreases which results in a drastic decrease of the TVFS\nbandwidth. As shown in Figs. 1, 3 and 5, the TVBS-I\nare located below the TVFS continuum over the entire\nBrillouin zone whereas, for TVBS-II, two situations occur depending on the strength of the vibron-phonon coupling. For a weak coupling, the band disappears inside\nthe continuum when the wave vector lies outside specific\nwindows whereas for a strong coupling, the band is located below the continuum over the entire Brillouin zone.\nAs when increasing the anharmonicity, the TVBS-I band\nis redshifted and its bandwidth is strongly reduced. In\nthe same way, the anharmonicity modifies the nature of\nthe TVBS-II band. If the band is resonant with the continuum, the anharmonicity tends to open the wave vector windows and when the TVBS-II band is not resonant\n\n\f8\nwith the continuum, the anharmonicity induces a redshift\nof the band as well as a decrease of its bandwidth. Note\nthat these different features generalize the work detailed\nin Ref. [19] devoted to the two-vibron dynamics in onedimensional model of helix. We thus can conclude that\nthe occurrence of both TVBS-I and TVBS-II originates\nin the interplay between the intramolecular anharmonicity A and the site dependent small polaron binding energy EB (n). More precisely, in a 3D helix, it is straightforward to show that the small polaron binding energy\ntakes significant values for n = 0 and n = 3 and satisfies\nEB (0) \u2248 2EB (3) in a perfect agreement with the results\nobtained in Ref. [19]. Therefore, A and EB (0) are the key\nparameters which favors the occurrence of the TVBS-I\nthrough the terms \u00c2b\u2020n b\u2020n bn bn in Eq.(5) which characterize an attractive interaction between two vibrons located\nonto the same amide-I mode. By contrast, the occurrence of TVBS-II is essentially controlled by the parameter EB (3) which, as shown in Eq.(5), yields an attractive\ninteraction between two vibrons located onto two nearest neighbor amide-I modes belonging to the same spine.\nTo obtain a TVBS-II band below the TVFS continuum\nover the entire Brillouin zone, EB (3) must exceed a critical value typically of about 2Jef f (3). As a consequence,\nTVBS-I refers to the trapping of the two vibrons onto\nthe same amide-I mode whereas TVBS-II characterizes\ntwo vibrons trapped onto two nearest neighbor amide-I\nmodes located in the same spine.\nHowever, the main results of the present study concerns the influence of the temperature on the nature of\nthe two-vibron states in a real helix.\nAs detailed in paper I [18], the single-vibron dynamics\nin a 3D \u03b1-helix is characterized by two kinds of hopping processes. The first kind refers to vibrational transition between different spines of hydrogen-bonded peptide units whereas the second kind involves vibron hops\nalong the same spine. In that context, the nature of\nthe vibron dynamics essentially results from the competition between these two kinds of processes. This previous study has revealed that several parameters such as\nthe temperature, the small polaron binding energy and\nthe helix backbone conformation, allow for a transition\nbetween two regimes. At low temperature the small polaron behaves like an undressed vibron so that the 3D\nnature of the helix plays a crucial role and the vibron is\ndelocalized between the different spines. Within this undressed limit, vibron transitions between nearest neighbor and third nearest neighbor sites represent the dominant hopping mechanism since J(1) = \u221212.4 cm\u22121 and\nJ(3) = 7.8 cm\u22121 whereas J(2) = 3.9 cm\u22121 . By contrast,\nat biological temperature or strong small polaron binding energy, the dressing effect strongly reduces the vibrational exchanges between different spines so that the\npolaron tends to propagate along a single spine, only.\nIndeed, the dressing for vibrons hops between different\nspines is more efficient than the dressing which affects\nvibron transitions along the same spine so that Jef f (3)\nbecomes the dominant hopping constant.\n\nThe singular behavior of the single vibron dynamics\nis responsible for the occurrence of a strong temperature dependence on the two-vibron states. To illustrate\nthis feature, let us first consider the temperature dependence of the TVFS continuum. Indeed, Figs. 1 clearly\nshow that at low temperature the continuum exhibits a\nlarge bandwidth characterized by a complicated structure whereas at biological temperature (Figs. 3 and 5),\nit appears symmetrically distributed around the central\nfrequency 2\u03c9\u02c60 . In that context, it is straightforward to\nshow that the continuum is perfectly reproduced from the\nknowledge of the single vibron energy spectrum and that\nthe TVFS bandwidth is twice the single vibron bandwidth. Therefore, since single vibron states are delocalized over the three spines at low temperature, the different hopping constants contribute to the bandwidth.\nFor instance, when T = 5 K, \u03c71 = 25 pN, \u03c73 = 50 pN\nand A = 8 cm\u22121 , the single vibron bandwidth is about\n50 cm\u22121 and yields a TVFS bandwidth equal to 100.0\ncm\u22121 in a perfect agreement with the results displayed\nin Figs. 1. Note that in that case the bandwidth mainly\ndepends on both Jef f (1) and Jef f (3). By contrast, at biological temperature, the continuum displayed in Figs. 3\nand 5 mainly refers to two independent vibrons confined\nin a given spine. When long range hopping constants\nare disregarded, the single vibron bandwidth is equal to\n4Jef f (3). Therefore, when T = 310 K, \u03c71 = 25 pN and\n\u03c73 = 50 pN, this value leads to a TVFS bandwidth equal\nto 29.12 cm\u22121 when A = 8 cm\u22121 , in a perfect agreement with the value characterizing the real continuum\n(see Figs. 3). Note that the shape of the continuum\nresults form the unfolding of the two-vibron dispersion\ncurves of the 1D model since the Brillouin zone of the\nhelix is three time greater than the Brillouin zone of the\ncorresponding 1D model. Moreover, long range effects in\nthe hopping constants, which have been disregarded in\nRef.[19], lead to non vanishing values of the continuum\nfor both K = \u03c0/3 and K = \u03c0.\nThe influence of the temperature on the two-vibron\nbound states is twofold. First, it strongly modifies the\nnature of both TVBS-I and TVBS-II. Then, it allows for\nthe occurrence of a third bound state, i.e. TVBS-III,\nwhich has not been obtained within our previous onedimensional model [19].\nAt low temperature (see Figs. 2), non vanishing interspine hopping constants yield a three dimensional nature\nof both TVBS-I and TVBS-II which the wave functions\nextend over the three spines of the helix. Although the\ntwo vibrons are trapped close to each other, there are not\nconfined in the same spine so that the pair is allowed to\nexplore the entire 3D nature of the helix. By contrast,\nat biological temperature, the dressing effect strongly reduces the vibrational exchanges between different spines\nso that only intraspine hopping constants remain. The\npairs are thus confined in a given spine and exhibits the\nsame features as the bound states described within the\none-dimensional model (see Figs. 4). In a marked contrast with the previous situation, the occurrence of the\n\n\f9\nthird bound states is strictly due to the 3D nature of\nthe helix. More precisely, as shown in Sec. II, this 3D\nnature manifests itself by the introduction of a generalized site dependent small polaron binding energy EB (n).\nAlthough EB (n) takes significant values for n = 0 and\nn = 3, it does not strictly vanish for n = 1. Note that\nEB (n) \u2248 0 for n = 2 and n > 3. As a consequence,\nEq.(5) clearly shows that this non vanishing value contributes to an attractive interaction between two vibrons\nlocated onto two different spines. However, the formation\nof TVBS-III results from the competition between the\ninterspine hopping constants, which tends to break the\npair, and the previous attractive interaction which allows\nfor the trapping of the pair. At low temperature, the interspine hopping constants are strong enough to prevent\nthe occurrence of the third bound states. By contrast,\nat biological temperature, the dressing effect strongly reduces the vibrational exchanges between different spines\nso that the attractive interaction mediated by EB (1) is\nsufficient to create the trapping of the two vibrons onto\ntwo different spines. Note that strictly speaking the key\nparameter for the occurrence of the TVBS-III is B\u0302(1),\nwhich, in addition to its strong dependence on EB (1),\nexhibits a weak contribution B(1) proportional to the\nintramolecular anharmonicity (see Eq.(6)). Due to the\nsign of the hopping constant J(1), B(1) is negative and\ntends to produce a repulsive interaction between the two\nvibrons. As a consequence, the binding energy of TVBSIII slightly decreases with the anharmonicity as shown in\nFigs. 5.\n\nFIG. 7: Pump-probe spectrum of the amide-I band for (a)\nT = 310 K, \u03c71 = 25 pN, \u03c73 = 50 pN, A = 8 cm\u22121 and (b)\nT = 310 K, \u03c71 = 37.5 pN, \u03c73 = 75 pN, A = 8 cm\u22121 .\n\nAt this step, let us mention that this theoretical\nwork clearly suggests the occurrence of two-vibron bound\nstates for the amide-I vibrations in \u03b1-helices. In a recent\nexperiment, P. Hamm and co-workers [21, 22] have performed the infrared pump-probe spectroscopy of the N-H\nstretch vibrations in a stable \u03b1-helix, the poly-\u03b3-benzylL-glutamate (PBLG). They observed two excited-state\nabsorption bands which were interpreted in terms of the\noccurrence of two kind of two-vibron bound states. In\nthat context, the knowledge of both the single-vibron\nand the two-vibron dynamics allows us to simulate this\npump-probe spectrum but for amide-I vibrations. During a pump-probe experiment, the helix interacts with\ntwo infrared short pulses, i.e. the pump and the probe\npulse [21, 22, 30, 31, 33, 34]. The pump pulse excites\nthe helix from its vibrational ground state to the first excited state. In other words, the pump creates a zero wave\nvector single vibron state. By contrast, the probe pulse\nmeasures the change of absorption as a result of that excitation. As a consequence, the pump-probe spectrum exhibits three contributions. The first contribution, called\nthe Bleach, corresponds to the loss of absorption due to\nthe depletion of the ground state whereas the second contribution characterizes the stimulated emission from the\nfirst excited state. These two processes lead to a negative\npeak in the pump-probe signal. The third contribution,\nwhich accounts for the creation of zero wave vector twovibron states from the excited single-vibron state, yields\n\na positive peak in the spectrum. From the knowledge\nof both the single-vibron [18] and two-vibron states, it\nis straightforward to calculate the matrix element of the\ndipole involved in the three transitions characterizing the\nspectrum [33]. To proceed, both the pump and the probe\npulses are assumed to be polarized along the axis of the\nhelix and an artificial width of 1 cm\u22121 has been introduced to plot the spectrum.\nFig. 7a shows the pump-probe bare spectrum at T =\n310 K and with the parameter values as in Fig. 3b. The\nspectrum, which is centered onto 2\u03c9\u02c60 , exhibits a single\nnegative peak located at -7.2 cm\u22121 and a single positive\npeak located at -34.0 cm\u22121 . In agreement with the result\ndisplayed in Fig. 3b, the positive peak is the signature of\nthe zero wave vector bound state TVBS-I supported by\nthe helix. Note that the frequency difference between the\ntwo peaks is about the binding energy of TVBS-I. For\na stronger vibron-phonon coupling, i.e. for parameter\nvalues as in Fig. 5b, the pump-probe spectrum shows\nthree peaks. A negative peak is located at -2.7 cm\u22121\nwhereas two positive peaks occur at -18.6 cm\u22121 and 62.6 cm\u22121 , respectively. As shown in Fig. 5b, the two\npositive peaks characterize the two bound states TVBSI and TVBS-II. The intensity of the peak connected to\nTVBS-II is about two times greater than the intensity\nof the peak associated to TVBS-I. Note that the binding\n\n10\n\nSignal (arb. units)\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n(a)\n-15\n-80\n\n-70\n\n-60\n\n-50\n\n-40 -30 -20\n\u03c9s (cm-1)\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n-60\n\n-50\n\n-40 -30 -20\n\u03c9s (cm-1)\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n10\n\nSignal (arb. units)\n\n5\n0\n-5\n-10\n-15\n-20\n-25\n-80\n\n(b)\n-70\n\n\f10\nenergy of TVBS-III is too weak so that the corresponding\npeak is embedded in the bleach.\nAs illustrated in Figs. 7, a pump-probe experiment\nprovides a direct evaluation of the strength of the different nonlinear sources favoring the occurrence of bound\nstates through the measurement of both the number of\npositive peaks and the values of the corresponding binding energy. Nevertheless, let us mention that relaxation\nmechanism have been neglected in the present analysis\nso that the width of the different peaks has been disregarded. For amide-I vibration, we expect a competition\nbetween the binding energy of the bound states and the\nwidth of the corresponding peaks which will result in a\ndifficulty to separate the different peaks. Note that it\nwas not the case for N-H modes in PGLB because although the width of the different peaks was about 50\ncm\u22121 , the binding energies of both TVBS-I and TVBS-II\nwere about 275 and 120 cm\u22121 , respectively. These large\nvalues originate in the strong anharmonicity of each N-H\nstretching mode (A = 60 cm\u22121 ) as well as in the strong\nvibron-phonon coupling (EB (0) \u2248 84 cm\u22121 ).\nTo conclude this discussion, let us address the fundamental question of the breather-like behavior of the twovibron bound states. Indeed, the formation of discrete\nbreathers in nonlinear classic lattices has been the subject of intense theoretical research during the last decade\n(for a recent review, see for instance Refs. [1, 2, 3, 8]).\nDiscrete breathers, which correspond to highly localized\nvibrational excitations in anharmonic lattices, do not require integrability for their existence and stability. They\nare not restricted to one-dimensional lattices and it has\nbeen suggested that they should correspond to quite general and robust time periodic solutions. Recently, the\nquantum nature of discrete breathers has been investigated and it has been suggested that bound states involving several quanta are good candidates for the quantum\ncounterpart of discrete breathers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 35, 36].\nTo illustrate the concept of quantum breather in \u03b1helices, we restrict our attention to TVBS-I which are\nlocated below the TVFS continuum over the entire first\nBrillouin zone. As shown previously, these states correspond to the trapping of two vibrons onto the same\namide-I mode and described two quanta which behave as\na single particle. Note that, at this step, the breather-like\nbehavior manifests itself in the localization of the separating distance between the two vibrons which form the\npair. To characterize the motion of the pair, we use the\nprocedure introduced by Proville [36] which consists in\ndefining the time dependent Wannier wave function as\n1 X i(Kn\u2212\u03c9K\u03bb t)\n\u03c6n (t) = \u221a\ne\n(10)\nN K\nWhen \u03bb is restricted to the TVBS-I band, \u03c6n (t) can\nbe viewed as the wave function associated to the two\ntrapped vibrons viewed as a single particle. To characterize the motion of that particle, we introduce a coherent lifetime, proportional to the invert of the TVBS-I\nbandwidth, which measures the time spent by the pair\n\n1\n(a)\n\n0.8\n0.6\nPn(t)\n\n12\n10\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n4\n0\n\n5\n\n8\n6 n\n\n2\n\n10\ntime (ps)\n\n15\n\n20\n\n0\n\n1\n(b)\n\n0.8\n0.6\nPn(t)\n\n12\n10\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n4\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n15\ntime (ps)\n\n8\n6 n\n\n2\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n0\n\n1\n(c)\n\n0.8\n0.6\nPn(t)\n\n12\n10\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n4\n0\n\n50\n\n100\ntime (ps)\n\n8\n6 n\n\n2\n150\n\n200\n\n0\n\nFIG. 8: Evolution of the probability Pn (t) to observe the\nvibron pair on the site n at time t. The pair, which has been\ncreated on the site n = 0 at time t = 0, is restricted to the\nTVBS-I band (see the text).(a) T = 5 K, \u03c71 = 25 pN, \u03c73 = 50\npN, A = 8 cm\u22121 , (b) T = 310 K, \u03c71 = 25 pN, \u03c73 = 50 pN,\nA = 8 cm\u22121 , (c) T = 310 K, \u03c71 = 37.5 pN, \u03c73 = 75 pN,\nA = 8 cm\u22121 .\n\non a given site. A zero bandwidth produces an infinite\ncoherent lifetime for the pair which exhibits a breatherlike behavior, i.e. the two vibrons are trapped around\nthe site where the pair has been created. By contrast,\na finite bandwidth leads to the delocalization of the pair\nwhich moves along the lattice.\nBy assuming that the pair is created onto the site n = 0\nat the initial time t = 0, Figs. 8 show the behavior of\nthe probability Pn (t) =| \u03c6n (t) |2 to observe the pair onto\nthe site n at time t. The three situations corresponding to the parameters used in Fig. 1b, 3b and 5b are\nillustrated in Fig. 8a, 8b and 8c, respectively. At low\ntemperature, Fig. 8a clearly shows the 3D nature of the\nTVBS-I since the pair tends to rapidly delocalize over the\nthree spines of the helix. Indeed, after a coherent lifetime\n\n\f11\nof about 1.5 ps, 80 % of the initial population have left\nthe excited site n = 0 and have been tranfered to sites\nbelonging to the other spines. Note that the population\nof the excited site shows damped oscillations due to the\nstrong anistropy which discrimites between inter and intra spine vibrational exchanges. When the temperature\nreaches T = 310 K, the confinement of the pair takes\nplace as illustrated in Fig. 8b so that the pair propagates\nalong the spine where it has been created. Nevertheless,\nthe finite value of the TVBS-I bandwidth prevents the\nlocalization of the pair which leaves the excited site after a coherent lifetime of about 7.8 ps. However, for a\nstronger vibron-phonon coupling, the TVBS-I bandwidth\nis drastically reduced so that the breather-like behavior\nof the pair manifests itself by an enhancement of its local\ncharacter (Fig. 8c). As previously, the pair is confined\nin the spine where it has been created but its coherent\nlifetime has been drastically increases and is about 86 ps.\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn the present paper, the two-vibron dynamics associated to amide-I modes in an \u03b1-helix has been described.\nThe 3D nature of the helix was modeled by three spines\nof hydrogen-bonded peptide units linked via covalent\nbonds. To remove the intramolecular anharmonicity of\neach amide-I mode and to renormalize the strong coupling between the vibrons and the phonons associated to\nthe external motion of the residues, two unitary transformations have been applied to finally obtain the dressed\nanharmonic vibrons point of view. In a perfect agreement with recent calculations performed within a onedimensional model of helix, it has been shown that the\ntwo-vibron energy spectrum supports both a TVFS continuum and two kinds of bound states, called TVBS-I\nand TVBS-II, connected to the trapping of two vibrons\nonto the same amide-I mode and onto two nearest neighbor amide-I modes belonging to the same spine, respectively. In addition, it has been shown that the interplay\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n\nS. Aubry, Physica D103, 201 (1997).\nS. Flach and C.R. Willis, Phys. Rep. 295, 181 (1998).\nR.S.

Status Solidi 59,\n\nbetween the temperature and the 3D nature of the helix strongly affects the characteristics of the two-vibron\nstates. This feature originates in the singular behavior\nof the single vibron dynamics which displays a transition\nbetween two regimes. At low temperature, the single\npolaron behaves as an undressed vibron delocalized between the different spines whereas at biological temperature, the dressing effect strongly reduces the vibrational\nexchanges between different spines so that the polaron is\nconfined in a single spine. The consequence is twofold.\nFirst, the nature of both TVBS-I and TVBS-II is strongly\nmodified. Then, a third bound state called TVBS-III occurs. At low temperature, non vanishing interspine hopping constants yield a three dimensional nature of both\nTVBS-I and TVBS-II which the wave functions extend\nover the three spines of the helix whereas, at biological temperature, the pairs are confined in a given spine\nand exhibits the same features as the bound states described within a 1D model. The occurrence of the TVBSIII results from the competition between the interspine\nhopping constants and the site dependent small polaron\nbinding energy which favors an attractive interaction between vibrons located onto different spines. If at low\ntemperature the hopping constants are strong enough to\nprevent the occurrence of TVBS-III, it is no longer the\ncase at biological. As a result the attractive interaction\nbecomes the dominant mechanism leading to the trapping of the two vibrons onto two different spines. Finally, the breather-like nature of the TVBS-I has been\nanalyzed by studying the time evolution of a vibron pair\ninitially created on a given site. Due to the 3D nature of\nTVBS-I, the pair rapidly delocalizes over the three spines\nat low temperature which results in a coherent lifetime\nof about a few picoseconds. By contrast, at biological\ntemperature, the pair is confined in the spine where it\nhas been created. Its coherent lifetime increases with the\nstrength of the vibron-phonon coupling and it has been\nshown that a strong coupling can localize the pair during\na time of about 86 ps.\n\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n\n465 ; Zh.
