Introduction\nLet M be a d-dimensional, compact manifold with boundary \u03a3 = \u2202M (all structures\nassumed smooth). A pseudo-Riemannian metric g o on the interior M + of M is said to be\nconformally compact if it extends to \u03a3 by g = r 2 go where g is non-degenerate up to the\nboundary, and r is a defining function for the boundary (i.e. \u03a3 is the zero locus of r, and\ndr is non-vanishing along \u03a3). Assuming the conormal to \u03a3 is not null, the restriction of g\nto T \u03a3 in T M |\u03a3 determines a conformal structure, and this is independent of the choice\nof defining function r; then \u03a3 with this conformal structure is termed the conformal\ninfinity of M + .\nConformally compact manifolds provide a framework for relating conformal geometry, and associated field theories, to the far field phenomena of the interior (pseudo-)Riemannian geometry of one higher dimension; the latter often termed the bulk. This\nidea seems to have had its origins in the work of Newman and Penrose, for treating four\ndimensional spacetime physics, and was further developed by LeBrun and others [47].\nThe seminal work of Fefferman\u2013Graham [20] developed a variant of this idea, termed a\nPoincar\u00e9(\u2013Einstein) metric, to develop a new approach to conformal invariant theory. On\nthe other hand key aspects of the spectral theory for Riemannian conformally compact\nmanifolds were pioneered by Mazzeo and Mazzeo-Melrose [50, 51, 52]. Related to this\nis the treatment of infinite volume hyperbolic manifolds by Patterson, Perry and others,\nsee [56] and references therein.\nMore recently there has been intense interest in these structures motivated first by links\nto the conjectural AdS/CFT correspondence of Maldacena and second by the realisation\nthat they are prototypes for holographic and renormalization ideas [48, 1, 43, 19, 54].\nOn the side of mathematics, critical progress was made in [40] based around a scalar\nLaplacian eigen-equation (given in our conventions)\n\u0001\n(1.1)\n\u2206go + s(n \u2212 s) u = 0.\nThere earlier spectral results results were further developed, along with other tools, and\nused to relate the corresponding scattering matrix on conformally compact asymptotically Einstein manifolds to invariant objects on their boundaries at infinity; the latter\nincluding the conformally invariant powers of the Laplacian (the so-called \"GJMS\" operators of [36]) and Branson's Q-curvature of [4]. A sample of the subsequent and related\nprogress includes [42, 44, 45, 53, 61]. In all of these works the formal asymptotics play a\ncritical role. Indeed in [40] it is emphasised at an early point that although the scattering\nproblem they treat is certainly a global object the main new results there, and also in [21],\nconcern \"formal Taylor series statements at the boundary\". The formal calculations are\nbased around special coordinates adapted to the structure following [38, 35].\nThe purpose of the current article is to take full advantage of the interior conformal\nstructure in order to develop a new universal, and coordinate independent, approach to\na class of natural problems associated canonically with conformally compact manifolds.\n\n\fCalculus on conformally compact manifolds\n\n3\n\nThe focus here is on formal and asymptotic aspects along the boundary, and the problems\nthemselves are derived directly from the geometric data of the structure. The same\ngeometric inputs yield a calculus to treat these; this applies in all signatures and along\nany hypersurface that is a conformal infinity in the sense described above. This includes,\nfor example, the cases of future and past infinities of de Sitter-like spaces. We obtain\ncomplete formulae for the asymptotics to all orders. A specialisation of the calculus is\napplied to give simple holographic formulae for the GJMS operators and the Q-curvature.\nWe show that the problems considered include those looked at in [40], for example, but\nsimultaneously include their wave analogues. Importantly, here these problems are based\naround a completely different conceptual schema, which uses conformal tractor calculus\nas in [3, 11, 27]; in particular this is used to show that the problems themselves arise\ncanonically from the fundamental conformal geometry of the interior/bulk structure.\nOur approach applies to weighted tractor fields of arbitrary type. This provides a\nuniversal framework for treating tensor and spinor fields of any tensor type and any conformal weight. This is realized by a comprehensive treatment of Laplace/wave equations\nfor differential forms on Poincar\u00e9\u2013Einstein structures in [29]. In addition, in this Article,\nwe treat fields that we term log densities (see Section 2.1); this connects with problems\ntreated in [21, 23].\nA conformally compact manifold may be viewed as a conformal manifold (M, c) with\nboundary (so c is an equivalence class of conformally related metrics), that is also\nequipped with a generalised scale \u03c3. This scale determines the metric go on the interior and also defines the boundary; \u03c3 is a conformal density (see Section 2.1) with the\nboundary as its zero locus, and relative to any metric from the conformal class the function representing \u03c3 is a defining function for the boundary. Thus a conformally compact\nstructure is precisely the data (M, c, \u03c3). On the other hand there is a canonical and\nfundamental conformally invariant, second order, and vector bundle valued, differential\noperator D due to Thomas [3] that is determined by just the conformal structure (M, c).\nThis operator applied to \u03c3 (and dividing by the dimension) gives I := d1 D\u03c3, which we\nterm the scale tractor. It will later be evident that there are obvious representation\ntheoretic interpretations of this as the object breaking (or rather splitting) a conformal\nsymmetry group pointwise via the additional structure coming from the scale. The key\npoint here is that there is an invariant contraction of I with D to yield a second order\noperator I*D that is canonical to the structure. The problems we consider in Section 5\nare equations for this degenerate Laplacian operator (or rather, degenerate wave type operator in non-Riemannian signatures), with very general and (and probably all) natural\nboundary conditions.\nApart from the naturality of I*D to pseudo-Riemannian and conformally compact\nstructures, some comments clarify why it is a priori both natural and extremely interesting to study in this context:\n\u2022\n\nFirst I*D is a degenerate Laplacian, with degeneracy precisely along \u03a3 = \u2202M .\nAway from \u03a3, and calculated in the metric g o , the equation I*D u = 0 is (\u2206go +\ns(n\u2212s))u = 0, as in 1.1 with the spectral parameter s a fixed dimensional shift of\nthe conformal weight, see Section 2.5, and also [27]. (Precisely, I*D u = 0 agrees\nwith (\u2206go + s(n \u2212 s))u = 0 in the case of go having constant scalar curvature\nSc = \u2212d(d \u2212 1), in general scalar curvature enters explicitly.) However while the\noperator \u2206go +s(n\u2212s) is not defined along \u03a3 where go is singular, in contrast I*D,\nby dint of its conformal properties, extends to the boundary; along \u03a3, I*D is a\nmultiple of the first order conformal Robin operator of [16].\n\n\f4\n\nGover & Waldron\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nOn Einstein manifolds I is parallel for the tractor connection, and powers of I*D\ngive the conformal GJMS operators and their Q-curvatures [26]. This holds in\nparticular on the interior of Poincar\u00e9\u2013Einstein manifolds, and this features in\nthe asymptotics problems in this setting, enabling a smooth expansion where\notherwise log terms would arise, see Remark 5.19.\nThere is strong evidence that the operator I*D is fundamental in physics; I*D u =\n0 is one of the key equations in a system which uniformly controls massive, massless, and partially massless free field field particles [33, 34, 58], and extensions\ninclude interacting terms and supersymmetry [59]. In fact, in the setting of an\nAdS/CFT correspondence, our results essentially amount to explicit all orders asymptotic series for \"bulk to boundary propagators\" for general fields on arbitrary\nbulk geometries\n\nWe summarise our results and plan as follows:\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nIn Section 3 we prove that \u03c3 and I*D (or the slight variant thereof, \u22121\nI 2 I*D) generate a g := sl(2) algebra of operators canonically determined by the structure.\nThis is different to the sl(2) algebra of GJMS [36] coming from the Fefferman\u2013\nGraham ambient metric. It leads to different asymptotic expansions which include phenomena not seen from the ambient metric alone. The structure g critically underlies the boundary calculus. Sections 4 and 5 apply this calculus, see\ne.g., Lemma 5.3 and Proposition 5.4.\nWe show in Section 4 that standard identities in the universal enveloping algebra\nof g lead to the identification of differential operators on M that act tangentially\nalong \u03a3. In particular we obtain simple new holographic formulae for the GJMS\noperators and Branson's Q-curvature.\nIn Section 5.1 and Section 5.3 we consider two different extension problems for\nthe equation I*D u = 0, at a generic class of weights. The first is Dirichlet in\nnature while the second assumes the solution vanishes along \u03a3 to a given order\nthat is related to weight. In fact we show that these are the only possibilities\nfor smooth (i.e. power series) asymptotics. We obtain complete formal solutions\ndescribed by a Bessel type solution operator; these arise from algebra associated\nto g. While the presence of Bessel functions is often associated with separation\nof variables approaches (e.g. [41, 62]), it is important to note that here the asymptotic expansions are given in terms of series in powers of \u03c3, which is part of\nthe data of the structure itself, and the solution operator also has this property.\nNo coordinates are used, the treatment is canonical, and in Proposition 5.8 we\nshow that the solutions are independent of any choices.\nIn Section 5.4 we show the remaining weights can be treated by the introduction of expansions involving log terms. These cases involve significant subtleties.\nIn particular to match the I*D equation with (1.1) it is necessary to choose a\nbackground (second) scale. After some detailed treatment the influence of this\nchoice is made completely clear, and the entire solution (family) is controlled by\nan explicit solution operator. The second scale, unlike the generalised scale \u03c3,\nextends to the boundary. We show that in fact only the boundary dependence\nof the second scale influences the solution. This result dovetails nicely with the\nAdS/CFT relationship between boundary renormalization group flows and bulk\ngeometries [41, 62, 17].\n\n\fCalculus on conformally compact manifolds\n\n5\n\nIn Section 5.6 we show that when the solutions are expressed in the internal scale\nwe get results of the usual form as in, for example, the work [40] of GrahamZworski. In fact it is easily verified that our expressions for the asymptotics\nagree with [40, 21], at least in the cases of overlap. It should be emphasised\nthat throughout our treatment is valid in any signature, and whereas the equation (\u2206go + s(n \u2212 s))u = 0 has mainly been studied with u a function, here we\ntreat the I*D equation on sections of (weighted) tractor bundles, and on conformally compact structures of any signature. The operator I*D on tractor bundles\ndetermines natural equations on tensor and spinor fields, this is central to the\ntreatments in [33, 34, 59]. This means our results can be used to deduce results\nfor general tensor and spinor fields in the spirit of the Eastwood curved translation principle, see [27] for an early discussion of this. In physics there is currently\nconsiderable interest in understanding higher spin systems via the AdS/CFT machinery [46, 24]. For differential forms, in [2] Aubry-Guillarmou have shown that\nsubtle global conformal invariants [6] of the conformal infinity are captured by\nPoincar\u00e9-Einstein interior problems with suitable boundary behaviour. In the\naccompanying Article [29], we give formal, all order, solutions to those problems\nand explicit holographic formulae for the operators yielding those invariants. This\nrelies on the universal boundary calculus developed here and extends the curved\ntranslation principle.\nG. gratefully acknowledges support from the Royal Society of New Zealand via Marsden Grant 10-UOA-113; both authors wish to thank their coauthor's institutions for\nhospitality during the preparation of this work.

Conformal geometry and tractor calculus\nThroughout we work on a manifold M of dimension d \u2265 3. For simplicity we assume\nthat this is connected and orientable. If this is equipped with a metric (of some signature (p, q)) and \u2207a denotes the corresponding Levi-Civita connection then the Riemann\ncurvature tensor R is given by\nR(X, Y )Z = \u2207X \u2207Y Z \u2212 \u2207Y \u2207X Z \u2212 \u2207[X,Y ] Z,\nwhere X, Y , and Z are arbitrary vector fields. In an abstract index notation (cf. [55]) R\nis denoted by Rab c d , and R(X, Y )Z is X a Y b Z d Rab c d . This can be decomposed into the\ntotally trace-free Weyl curvature Cabcd and the symmetric Schouten tensor Pab according\nto\n(2.1)\n\nRabcd = Cabcd + 2gc[a Pb]d + 2gd[b Pa]c ,\n\nwhere [* * * ] indicates antisymmetrisation over the enclosed indices.

We need some results and techniques\nfrom conformal geometry. Recall that a conformal geometry is a d-manifold equipped\nwith an equivalence class c of metrics (of some fixed signature (p, q)) such that if g, gb \u2208 c\nthen gb = e2\u03a5 g for some \u03a5 \u2208 C \u221e (M ). Conformally invariant operators on functions\nor between (unweighted) tensor bundles are almost non-existent, thus the notion of covariance and bi-weight is often used. In fact this covariance may be replaced by true\n\n\f6\n\nGover & Waldron\n\ninvariance, with conceptual and calculational simplifications if we introduce conformal\ndensities. For more details on the approach here see [10, 31].\nA conformal structure on M may also be viewed as a smooth ray subbundle G \u2282\nS 2 T \u2217M whose fibre over x \u2208 M consists of conformally related metrics at the point x.\nThe principal bundle \u03c0 : G \u2192 M has structure group R+ , and so each representation\nR+ \u220b x 7\u2192 x\u2212w/2 \u2208 End(C) induces a natural (oriented) line bundle on (M, [g]) that we\nterm the conformal density bundle of weight w \u2208 C, and denote E[w]. The typical fibre\nof E[w] is C, which we view as the complexification of an oriented copy of R, since for w\nreal there is naturally a real ray subbundle E+ [w] of positive elements in E[w]. Note that,\nby definition, a section \u03c4 of E[w] is equivalent to a function \u03c4 on G with the equivariance\nproperty\n\u03c4 (t2 g, p) = tw \u03c4 (g, p),\nwhere t \u2208 R+ , g \u2208 c, and p \u2208 M . Note that g is a section of G and the pullback of \u03c4\nby this is a function f on M that represents \u03c4 in the trivialisation determined by g. If\ngb = e2\u03a5 g, where \u03a5 \u2208 C \u221e (M ) and fb is the pullback of \u03c4 via b\ng, then\nfb = ew\u03a5 f.\n\nConformal densities are often treated informally as an equivalence class of such functions.\nEach metric g \u2208 c determines a canonical section \u03c4 \u2208 \u0393E[1], viz. the section with the\nproperty that \u03c4 (g, p) = 1 for all p \u2208 M . It follows that there is a tautological section of\nS 2 T \u2217M \u2297 E[2] that is termed the conformal metric, denoted g with the property that any\nnowhere zero section \u03c4 \u2208 \u0393E[1] determines a metric g \u2208 c via g := \u03c4 \u22122 g. Henceforth the\nconformal metric g is the default object that will be used to identify T M with T \u2217M [2]\n(rather than a metric from the conformal class) and to form metric traces.\nNote that since each g \u2208 c determines a trivialisation of E[w], it also determines\na corresponding connection on E[w]. We write \u2207 for this and call it the Levi-Civita\nconnection, since a power of this agrees with the Levi-Civita connection on \u039bd T \u2217M (see\ne.g. [10]).\nAs well as the density bundles E[w], the conformal structure also determines, in an\nobvious way, bundles F[w] induced from the log representations of R+ . Here also, we\nmay take the weight w \u2208 C, and we refer to F[w] as a log density bundle. In this case\nthe fibre is C as the complexification of R viewed as an affine space, and the total space\nof the bundle is G \u00d7 C modulo the equivalence relation\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(t2 g, p), y \u223c (g, p), y \u2212 w log t .\n\nIn particular F[0] is just E, the trivial bundle. For a general weight w, a section \u03bb of\nF[w] is equivalent to a function \u03bb : G \u2192 C with the equivariance property\n\n(2.2)\n\n\u03bb(t2 g, p) = \u03bb(g, p) + w log t ,\n\nwhere, as before, t \u2208 R+ , g \u2208 c, and p \u2208 M . As a smooth structure, F[w] is a trivial line\nbundle. However its geometric content is not compatible in the usual way with linear\noperations. Nevertheless it is not difficult to see that we may define such operations on\nsections, in an obvious way, via their representative functions on G. This determines a well\ndefined notion of adding sections of F[w1 ] and F[w2 ], but note that for \u03bb1 \u2208 \u0393F[w1 ] and\n\u03bb2 \u2208 \u0393F[w2 ], the sum \u03bb1 +\u03bb2 is a section of F[w1 +w2 ]. Similarly we see that, for w0 6= 0,\npointwise multiplication by w0 determines a bundle isomorphism w0 : F[1] \u2192 F[w0 ].\nNote that if \u03c4 is a positive real section of E+ [w] and \u03c4 the corresponding equivariant\nfunction on G, then the composition log \u25e6 \u03c4 has the property (2.2), and so is equivalent\nto a section of F[w] that we shall denote log \u03c4 . It is easily seen that a real section of\n\n\fCalculus on conformally compact manifolds\n\n7\n\nF[1] is log \u03c4 for some nowhere zero section \u03c4 \u2208 \u0393E[1]. On the space of real sections in\n\u0393F[1] the Levi-Civita connection \u2207 (as determined by some metric g \u2208 c) determines an\noperator \u2207 : \u0393F[1] \u2192 \u0393(T \u2217 M ) by\nlog \u03c4 7\u2192 \u03c4 \u22121 \u2207\u03c4.\n\nThis is then extended to \u2207 : \u0393F[w] \u2192 \u0393(T \u2217 M ) by demanding that \u2207 commute with\ncomplex multiplication, and this is consistent with also requiring \u2207 act linearly over the\nsum of log density sections.\nFinally in this Section we define the weight operator w. On sections of a conformal\ndensity bundle this is just the linear operator that returns the weight. So if \u03c4 \u2208 E[w0 ]\nthen\nw \u03c4 = w0 \u03c4.\n\u2202\nin the coordinates\nThere is a canonical Euler operator v on G; this is given by t \u2202t\nd\n(t, x) \u2208 R+ \u00d7 R on G induced by coordinates x on M and a choice of g \u2208 c, where in\nthese coordinates (t2 g, p) 7\u2192 (t, x(p)). The weight operator arises from the restriction of\nthis to suitably equivariant sections, for example w\u03c4 = v\u03c4 . Thus w satisfies a Leibniz\nrule: for example if \u03c41 \u2208 \u0393E[w1 ] and \u03c42 \u2208 \u0393E[w2 ] then w (\u03c41 \u03c42 ) = (w1 + w2 )\u03c41 \u03c42 . This\nalso determines the action of w on log densities: if \u03bb \u2208 \u0393F[w0 ] then\n(2.3)\n\nw \u03bb = w0 .\n\nIn view of the Leibniz property we may also write [w, \u03bb] = w0 where [ , ] indicates an\noperator commutator bracket.\n2.2. Elements of tractor calculus. The systematic construction of conformally invariant differential operators can be facilitated by tractor calculus [3]. This is based around a\nbundle and connection that is linked to, and equivalent to, the normal conformal Cartan\nconnection of Elie Cartan [11, 9].\nOn a conformal d-manifold (M, c), the (standard) tractor bundle T (or E A as the\nabstract index notation) is a canonical rank d + 2 vector bundle equipped with the\ncanonical (normal) tractor connection \u2207T . A choice of metric g \u2208 c determines an\nisomorphism\n(2.4)\n\ng\n\nT \u223c\n= E[1] \u2295 T \u2217M [1] \u2295 E[\u22121] .\n\nIn the following we shall frequently use (2.4). Sometimes this will be without any explicit\ng\ncomment but also we may write for example T = (\u03c3, \u03bca , \u03c1), or alternatively [T ]g =\n(\u03c3, \u03bca , \u03c1), to mean T is an invariant section of T and (\u03c3, \u03bca , \u03c1) is its image under the\nisomorphism (2.4). In terms of this splitting the tractor connection is given by\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n\u2207a \u03c3 \u2212 \u03bca\n\u03c3\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\nT \uf8ec\n(2.5)\n\u2207a \uf8ec \u03bcb \uf8f7 := \uf8ec \u2207a \u03bcb + g ab \u03c1 + Pab \u03c3 \uf8f7 .\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ed\nc\n\u03c1\n\u2207a \u03c1 \u2212 Pac \u03bc\nChanging to a conformally related metric gb = e2\u03a5 g gives a different isomorphism, which\nis related to the previous by the transformation formula\n(2.6)\n\n\\\n(\u03c3,\n\u03bcb , \u03c1) = (\u03c3, \u03bcb + \u03c3\u03a5b , \u03c1 \u2212 g cd \u03a5c \u03bcd \u2212 12 \u03c3g cd \u03a5c \u03a5d ),\n\nwhere \u03a5a is the one-form d\u03a5. It is straightforward to verify that the right-hand-side\nof (2.5) also transforms in this way and this verifies the conformal invariance of \u2207T . In\nthe following we will usually write simply \u2207 for the tractor connection. Since it is the\n\n\f8\n\nGover & Waldron\n\nonly connection we shall use on T , its dual, and tensor powers, this should not cause any\nconfusion.\nThere is also a conformally invariant tractor metric h on T . This is given (as a\nquadratic form on T A as above) by\n(2.7)\n\n(\u03c3, \u03bc, \u03c1) 7\u2192 g \u22121 (\u03bc, \u03bc) + 2\u03c3\u03c1 =: h(T, T ) = hAB T A T B ;\n\nit is preserved by the connection. We shall often write T 2 as a shorthand for the right\nhand side of this display. Note that this has signature (p + 1, q + 1) on a conformal\nmanifold (M, c) of signature (p, q). The tractor metric hAB and its inverse hAB are used\nto identify T with its dual in the obvious way.\nTensor powers of the standard tractor bundle T , and tensor parts thereof, are vector\nbundles that are also termed tractor bundles. We shall denote an arbitrary tractor bundle\nby E \u03a6 and write E \u03a6 [w] to mean E \u03a6 \u2297 E[w]; w is then said to be the weight of E \u03a6 [w]. In\nthe obvious way, the operator w of Section 2.1 is extended to sections of weighted tractor\nbundles E \u03a6 [w] \u220b f by\nwf = wf .\nWhereas the tractor connection maps sections of a weight 0 tractor bundle E \u03a6 to\nsections of T \u2217M \u2297 E \u03a6 , there is a conformally invariant operator which maps between\nsections of weighted tractor bundles. This is the Thomas-D (or tractor-D) operator\nDA : \u0393E \u03a6 [w] 7\u2192 \u0393(E A \u2297 E \u03a6 [w \u2212 1]),\ngiven in a scale g by\n\n(2.8)\n\n\uf8eb\n\n(d + 2w \u2212 2)wV\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n[DA V ]g = \uf8ec (d + 2w \u2212 2)\u2207a V\n\uf8ed\n\u2212(\u2206 + Jw)V\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f8\n\nwhere \u2206 = g ab \u2207a \u2207b , and \u2207 is the coupled Levi-Civita-tractor connection [3, 60].\nA key point to emphasise here is that the Thomas-D operator is a fundamental object\nin conformal geometry. On a conformal manifold the tractor bundle is \"as natural\" as\nthe tangent bundle. On the other hand the tractor-D operator on densities on \u0393E[1]\nbasically defines the tractor bundle, see [11].\n2.3. Almost Einstein structures and Poincar\u00e9\u2013Einstein manifolds. We recall\nhere some facts from the literature that we will need later. These partly motivate our\noverall approach. The first is that conformal geometry has a strong bias toward Einstein\nmetrics [57]. Following [30] we state this as follows.\nTheorem 2.1. On a conformal manifold (M d , c) (of any signature) there is a 1-1 correspondence between conformal scales \u03c3 \u2208 \u0393E[1], such that g\u03c3 = \u03c3 \u22122 g is Einstein, and\nparallel standard tractors I with the property that XA I A is nowhere vanishing. The mapping from Einstein scales to parallel tractors is given by \u03c3 7\u2192 1d DA \u03c3 while the inverse is\nI A 7\u2192 X A IA .\nThe statement as here is easily verified using (2.5), or may be viewed as an easy\nconsequence of the definition of the tractor connection from [3]. However the normal\ntractor connection is canonical from other points of view, and so this suggests a deep\nlink between conformal geometry and Einstein structures, or more generally to almost\nEinstein structures [27] as follows.\n\n\fCalculus on conformally compact manifolds\n\n9\n\nDefinition 2.2. We say that a conformal manifold (M d , c), d \u2265 3, is almost Einstein if\nit is equipped with a non-zero parallel standard tractor I.\nSince this condition is equivalent to a certain holonomy reduction of the normal tractor\nconnection, it follows at once that in general a conformal manifold (M, c) will not admit\nan almost Einstein structure. It is only a slight generalisation of the Einstein condition,\nand in fact it follows easily from the Theorem above, that on an almost Einstein manifold\n\u03c3 is non-zero on an open dense set [30]. Note that the zero locus Z(\u03c3) of the \"scale\" \u03c3\nis a conformal infinity, if non-empty.\nOn a Riemannian conformally compact manifold, if the defining function (as in Section 1) satisfies |dr|2g = 1 along M , the sectional curvatures of go tend to \u22121 at infinity\nand the structure is said to be asymptotically hyperbolic (AH) [50]. The model geometry\nhere is the Poincar\u00e9 hyperbolic ball and thus the corresponding metrics are sometimes\ncalled Poincar\u00e9 metrics. Generalising the hyperbolic ball in a more strict way, one may\nsuppose that the interior conformally compact metric g o is Einstein with the normalisation Ric(go ) = \u2212ngo , where n = d \u2212 1, and in this case the structure is said to be\nPoincar\u00e9-Einstein (PE); in fact PE manifolds are necessarily asymptotically hyperbolic.\nAs noted in [25], and then discussed in more detail in [27], we have the following result.\nProposition 2.3. A Poincar\u00e9\u2013Einstein manifold is a (Riemannian signature) almost\nEinstein manifold (M, c, I) with boundary satisfying \u2202M = Z(\u03c3), and such that I 2 = 1.\nIt follows that the notion of an almost Einstein structure provides an approach for\ntreating Poincar\u00e9\u2013Einstein structures that is closely related to the Cartan/tractor calculus [28].\nSurprisingly, for many problems the same techniques apply to any conformally compact\nstructure, and this is a critical observation we make and use here.\n2.4. The scale tractor. To avoid awkward language we shall use the term (generalised)\nscale for any section \u03c3 \u2208 \u0393E[1] that is not identically zero; only in the case that \u03c3 is\nnowhere zero is this a true scale, so that \u03c3 \u22122 g is a metric.\nDefinition 2.4. For \u03c3 a scale, on any conformal manifold, we call\n1\nIA := DA \u03c3\nd\nthe corresponding scale tractor. Note that \u03c3 = X A IA .\nSo an almost Einstein manifold has a parallel scale tractor. Specialising further: In\nthe model of the hemisphere equipped with its standard hyperbolic metric, I may be\nidentified with the vector in Rd+2 the fixing of which reduces the conformal group SO(d+\n1, 1) to a copy of SO(d, 1); the latter with orbit spaces the bounding equatorial conformal\ninfinity, and the interior [28].\nOne congenial feature of the scale tractor I is that its squared length gives a generalisation of the scalar curvature as follows (see [28] which deals with Riemannian signature\nbut the result applies in any case). First note that using (2.7) and (2.8) we have\n2\u03c3\ngo\nI 2 = \u2212 (\u2206\u03c3 + J\u03c3) + (\u2207a \u03c3)(\u2207a \u03c3).\nd\nThus if I 2 is nowhere vanishing then \u03c3 is non-vanishing on an open dense set in M .\nWhere \u03c3 is non-zero let us write g o := \u03c3 \u22122 g. Then, at any point q with \u03c3(q) 6= 0,\n2 o\n2\ngo\nI 2 = \u2212 \u03c32J = \u2212 J g ,\nd\nd\n\n\f10\n\nGover & Waldron\n\nsince \u03c3 is preserved by the metric it determines. Note that here J = g ab P ab , whereas\no\no P ab is the trace of the Schouten tensor as calculated in the scale g o .\nJ g = gab\nFurthermore note that if I 2 is nowhere zero then at any p \u2208 M such that \u03c3(p) = 0,\nwe have \u2207a \u03c3 6= 0; this follows since g ab (\u2207a \u03c3)(\u2207b \u03c3) is of the form I 2 \u2212 2\u03c3\u03c1 (for some\nsmooth density \u03c1). It follows that the zero locus Z(\u03c3) of \u03c3 is either empty or forms a\nsmooth hypersurface (i.e. a smoothly embedded codimension 1 submanifold), cf. [28].\nLet us summarise aspects of this discussion.\nLemma 2.5. Let I be a scale tractor on any conformal manifold. Where the scale\n\u03c3 := X A IA is non-zero we have\no\n\nScg\nI := I IA = \u2212\n,\nd(d \u2212 1)\n2\n\nA\n\nwith g o := \u03c3 \u22122 g. If I 2 is nowhere zero then \u03c3 is non-zero on an open dense set, and\nZ(\u03c3) (if non-empty) is a smooth hypersurface.\nIn this language asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds are conformally compact manifolds (M, c, \u03c3) with the scale tractor satisfying I 2 = 1 along \u2202M . On the other hand\non any manifold with (M, c, \u03c3) (where \u03c3 is a generalised scale), I 2 = constant means\nthat go has constant scalar curvature where defined, with, in particular, I 2 = 0 meaning that go has zero scalar curvature. On a given conformal manifold it is evident that\nseeking scales such that I 2 is constant is a natural problem generalising the Yamabe and\nLoewner-Nirenberg problems. Following [28] we say a conformal manifold with constant\nI 2 is almost scalar constant (ASC). In the case of a Riemannian signature ASC manifold\nwith I 2 6= 0, Z(\u03c3) can only be non-empty if I 2 is positive, and if so the structure is\nasymptotically hyperbolic along Z(\u03c3). On the other hand, in other signatures there are\nmore possibilities. For example de Sitter space is a Lorentzian signature ASC structure\nwith I 2 negative. The zero locus Z(\u03c3) is the boundary and comprises two components\nwhich are interpreted as a past conformal infinity and a future conformal infinity; each\nboundary component is spacelike (as follows easily from the sign of I 2 ).\n2.5. The canonical degenerate Laplacian. Putting the above results together we\nnote that there is a completely canonical differential operator on conformal manifolds\nequipped with a scale. Namely\nI*D := I A DA .\nThis acts on any weighted tractor bundle, preserving its tensor type but lowering the\nweight:\nI*D : E \u03a6 [w] \u2192 E \u03a6 [w \u2212 1].\nNow there is a rather subtle point, the importance of which will soon be clear, namely\nthat, since the tractor-D operator DA is conformally invariant, the operator I*D is conformally invariant except by the explicit coupling to the scale tractor.\nExpanding I*D in terms of some background metric g, we have\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nw(d + 2w \u2212 2)\n\uf8f7\n\u0011\uf8ec\n\u0010\ng\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n1\na\nI*D = \u2212 d (\u2206\u03c3 + J\u03c3) \u2207 \u03c3 \u03c3 \uf8ec \u2207a (d + 2w \u2212 2) \uf8f7 ,\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\u2212(\u2206 + Jw)\n\n\fCalculus on conformally compact manifolds\n\n11\n\nand as an operator on any density or tractor bundle of some weight, e.g. w so E \u03a6 [w],\neach occurrence of w evaluates to w. So then\nw\n2w\ng\n(2.9)\nI*D = \u2212\u03c3\u2206 + (d + 2w \u2212 2)[(\u2207a \u03c3)\u2207a \u2212 (\u2206\u03c3)] \u2212\n(d + w \u2212 1)\u03c3J .\nd\nd\nNow if we calculate in the metric g o = \u03c3 \u22122 g, away from the zero locus of \u03c3, and trivialise\nthe densities accordingly, then \u03c3 = 1 in such a scale and we have\n\u0010 o 2w(d + w \u2212 1) o \u0011\ngo\nI*D = \u2212 \u2206g +\nJg .\nd\no\no\nIn particular if g o satisfies Jg = \u2212 d2 (i.e. Scg = \u2212d(d \u2212 1) or equivalently I 2 = 1) then,\nrelabeling d + w \u2212 1 =: s and d \u2212 1 =: n, we have\n(2.10)\n\n\u0001\no\ngo\nI*D = \u2212 \u2206g + s(n \u2212 s) ,\n\nas commented in the Introduction.\nOn the other hand, looking again to (2.9), we see that along \u03a3 = Z(\u03c3) (assumed\nnon-empty) the operator I*D is first order. For example (see [28]), if the manifold is\nASC with I 2 = 1, then along \u03a3\nI*D = (d + 2w \u2212 2)\u03b4n ,\n\non E \u03a6 [w], where \u03b4n is the conformal Robin operator,\ng\n\n\u03b4n = na \u2207ga \u2212 wH g ,\n\nof [16, 5] (twisted with the tractor connection); here na is a unit normal and H g the\nmean curvature, as measured in the metric g.\nTo further connect with other canonical problems studied in the literature, it is interesting to explicate the operator I*D on log densities. In particular let U \u2208 \u0393F[w],\nthen\n\u0003\n\u0003\nw\u0002\ng \u0002\nI*D U = \u2212 \u03c3\u2206 + (d \u2212 2)(\u2207a \u03c3)\u2207a U \u2212\n(d \u2212 2)\u2206\u03c3 + 2(d \u2212 1)\u03c3J .\nd\nThus in the preferred scale\n(2.11)\n\ngo\n\no\n\nI*D U = \u2212 \u2206g U + w(d \u2212 1) .\n\nThis last operator at w = \u22121 is precisely the one studied in [21].\n3. A boundary calculus for the degenerate Laplacian\nLet (M, c) be a conformal structure of dimension d \u2265 3 and of any signature. Given\n\u03c3 a section of E[1], write IA for the corresponding scale tractor. That is IA = d1 DA \u03c3.\nThen \u03c3 = X A IA .\n3.1. The sl(2). Suppose that f \u2208 E \u03a6 [w], where E \u03a6 denotes any tractor bundle. Select\ng\ng \u2208 c for the purpose of calculation, and write IA = (\u03c3, \u03bda , \u03c1) to simplify the notation.\nThen using \u03bda = \u2207a \u03c3, we have\n\u0001\n\u0001\nI*D \u03c3f = (d + 2w) (w + 1)\u03c3\u03c1f + \u03c3\u03bda \u2207a f + f \u03bda \u03bd a\n\u0001\n\u2212\u03c3 \u03c3\u2206f + 2\u03bda \u2207a f + f \u2206\u03c3 + (w + 1)J\u03c3f ,\n\nwhile\n\n\u0001\n\u2212\u03c3 I*D f = \u2212\u03c3(d + 2w \u2212 2) w\u03c1f + \u03bda \u2207a f + \u03c3 2 (\u2206f + wJf ) .\n\n\f12\n\nGover & Waldron\n\nSo, by virtue of the fact that \u03c1 = \u2212 1d (\u2206\u03c3 + J\u03c3), we have\n\n[I*D, \u03c3]f = (d + 2w)(2\u03c3\u03c1 + \u03bda \u03bd a )f.\n\ng\n\nNow I A IA = I 2 = 2\u03c3\u03c1 + \u03bda \u03bd a , whence the last display simplifies to\n[I*D, \u03c3]f = (d + 2w)I 2 f.\nDenoting by w the weight operator on tractors, we have the following.\nLemma 3.1. Acting on any section of a weighted tractor bundle we have\n[I*D, \u03c3] = I 2 (d + 2w),\nwhere w is the weight operator.\nRemark 3.2. A similar computation to above shows that, more generally,\n\u0001\nI*D \u03c3 \u03b1 f \u2212 \u03c3 \u03b1 I*Df = \u2212\u03c3 \u03b1\u22121 \u03b1 I 2 (d + 2w + \u03b1 \u2212 1)f ,\n\nfor any constant \u03b1.\n\nRemark 3.3. The identity of Lemma 3.1, and the algebra it generates (as below), is\nunchanged upon adding to the operator I*D an additional term of the form:\nk times\n\nz }| {\nI*D \u2192 I*D + W \u266f * * * \u266f ,\n\nwhere W is any weight \u22121 tractor tensor in \u0393(\u2297k End(T )) and \u266f denotes the natural\ntensorial action of endomorphisms on tractor sections (to the right), so for example on a\nrank one tractor T A\nW \u266f T A := \u2212W A B T B .\n/ A of Theorem 4.7 of [28], for example, obeys the\nHence the canonical operator I A D\nsame algebra as I*D with \u03c3 and the weight operator w. Thus the extension problem\nuncovered there for the W -tractor for almost Einstein structures is also solved formally\nby the algebraic methods introduced in Section 5 below.\nThe operator I*D lowers conformal weight by 1. On the other hand, as an operator (by\ntensor product) \u03c3 raises conformal weight by 1. We can record this by the commutator\nrelations\n[w, I*D] = \u2212I*D and [w, \u03c3] = \u03c3,\n\nso with the Lemma we see that the operators \u03c3, I*D, and w, acting on weighted scalar\nor tractor fields, generate an sl(2) Lie algebra, provided I 2 is nowhere vanishing. It is\nconvenient to fix a normalisation of the generators; we record this and our observations\nas follows.\nProposition 3.4. Suppose that (M, c, \u03c3) is such that I 2 is nowhere vanishing. Setting\nx := \u03c3, y := \u2212 I12 I*D, and h := d + 2w we obtain the commutation relations\n[h, x] = 2x,\n\n[h, y] = \u22122y,\n\n[x, y] = h,\n\nof standard sl(2) generators.\nIn the case of I 2 = 0 the result is an In\u00f6n\u00fc-Wigner contraction of the sl(2):\n[h, x] = 2x,\n\n[h, y] = \u22122y,\n\nwhere h and x are as before, but now y = \u2212I*D.\n\n[x, y] = 0,\n\n\fCalculus on conformally compact manifolds\n\n13\n\nSubsequently g will be used to denote this (sl(2)) Lie algebra of operators.

Tangential operators and holographic formulae\n\nSuppose that \u03c3 \u2208 \u0393E[1] is such that IA = d1 DA \u03c3 satisfies that I A IA = I 2 is nowhere\nzero. As explained in Section 2.4, the zero locus Z(\u03c3) of \u03c3 is then either empty or forms\na smooth hypersurface (i.e. a smoothly embedded codimension 1 submanifold), cf. [28]\nwhere the Riemannian signature case is discussed.\nConversely if \u03a3 is any smooth oriented hypersurface then, at least in a neighbourhood\nor \u03a3, there is a smooth defining function f . That is, \u03a3 is the zero locus of a smooth\nfunction s, with ds nowhere vanishing along \u03a3. Now take \u03c3 \u2208 \u0393E[1] to be the unique\ndensity which gives s in the trivialisation of E[1] determined by some g \u2208 c. It follows\nthen that \u03a3 = Z(\u03c3) and \u2207g \u03c3 is non-zero at all points of \u03a3. If \u2207g \u03c3 is nowhere null along\n\u03a3 we say \u03a3 is nowhere null and then I 2 is nowhere vanishing in a (possibly smaller)\nneighbourhood of \u03a3, and we are in the situation of the previous paragraph. We shall\ncall such a \u03c3 a defining density for \u03a3, and to simplify the discussion we shall take M to\nagree with this neighbourhood of \u03a3 and write Mo := M \\ \u03a3. Until further notice \u03c3 will\nmean such a section of E[1] with \u03a3 = Z(\u03c3) non-empty and nowhere null. Note that \u03a3\nhas a conformal structure c\u03a3 induced in the obvious way from (M, c) and is a conformal\ninfinity for the metric g o := \u03c3 \u22122 g on M \\ \u03a3.\n4.1. Tangential operators. Suppose that \u03c3 is a defining density for a hypersurface\n\u03a3. Let P : \u0393E \u03a6 [w1 ] \u2192 \u0393E \u03a6 [w2 ] be some linear operator in a neighbourhood of \u03a3. We\nshall say that P acts tangentially (along \u03a3) if P \u25e6 \u03c3 = \u03c3 \u25e6 Pe, where Pe : \u0393E \u03a6 [w1 \u2212 1] \u2192\n\u0393E \u03a6 [w2 \u2212 1] is some other linear operator on the same neighbourhood. The point is that\nfor a tangential operator P we have\nP (f + \u03c3h) = P f + \u03c3 Peh.\n\nThus along \u03a3 the operator P is insensitive to how f is extended off \u03a3. It is easily seen\nthat, for example, in the case that P is a tangential differential operator, there is a\nformula for P , along \u03a3, involving only derivatives tangential to \u03a3, and the converse also\nholds.\nUsing Corollary 3.5 we see at once that certain powers of I*D act tangentially on\nappropriately weighted tractor bundles. We state this precisely. Suppose that \u03a3 is a\n(nowhere null) hypersurface in a conformal manifold (M n+1 , c), and \u03c3 a defining density\nfor \u03a3. Then recall \u03a3 = Z(\u03c3) and I 2 is nowhere zero in a neighbourhood of \u03a3, where\n1\nDA \u03c3 is the scale tractor. The following holds.\nIA := n+1\nTheorem 4.1.

As in the Theorem above, we shall use the same notation Pk to mean the\ntangential differential operator defined by (4.1), and also the operator Pk : \u0393E \u03a6 [ k\u2212n\n2 ]|\u03a3 \u2192\n]|\nthat\nthis\ndetermines.\nThe\nmeaning\nwill\nbe\nclear\nby\ncontext.\n\u0393E \u03a6 [ \u2212k\u2212n\n\u03a3\n2\nRecall we write n = d\u22121. The operator Pn is said to be of critical order, since its order\nalong \u03a3 is n, the dimension of \u03a3. As an operator on functions we have the following.\nProposition 4.3. The differential operator on functions\nannihilates constant functions.\n\nPn : \u0393E\u03a3 \u2192 \u0393E\u03a3 [\u2212n]\n\nProof. Consider Pn 1. Since the ambient operator Pn is tangential there is no loss of\ngenerality in extending the constant function 1 on \u03a3 to the constant function 1 on M\nand calculating [Pn 1]\u03a3 . But DA 1 = 0, and so Pn 1 = 0.\n\u0003\n4.2. Holographic formulae for the GJMS operators and Q-curvature. Theorem 4.1 does not establish whether or not the Pk are non-trivial. In cases where they are\nnon-trivial then they will be intrinsic to the hypersurface if the metric g o is determined\nby the conformal structure on \u03a3 to sufficient order.\nIn the case where go is Einstein we can, for the most part, fill in these details. Note\nthat go Einstein implies I 2 is a non-zero constant. By a constant scaling of \u03c3 we may\no\ntake this to be \u00b11 (and recall Scg = \u2212n(n + 1) I 2 ), so without loss of generality we\nassume this.\nFirst we record the following.\no\n\nProposition 4.4. Suppose that (Mo , g o ) is Einstein, with Scg = \u2213n(n + 1). Then for\n\u03a6 \u2212k\u2212n\nk odd Pk : \u0393E \u03a6 [ k\u2212n\n2 ]|\u03a3 \u2192 \u0393E [ 2 ]|\u03a3 is the zero operator. For k even the operator has\nk\n\u00012\nleading term ( (\u22121)k (k \u2212 1)!! times) \u2206\u03a32 , (up to the sign \u00b1) where \u2206\u03a3 is the intrinsic\nLaplacian for (\u03a3, g\u03a3 ) with g\u03a3 \u2208 c\u03a3 .\nThe picture can be refined significantly for operators on densities. We write E\u03a3 [w] for\nthe intrinsic weight w conformal density bundle of (\u03a3, c\u03a3 ), and note that this may be\ncanonically identified with E[w]|\u03a3 .\no\n\nTheorem 4.5. Suppose that (Mo , g o ) is Einstein, with Scg = \u2213n(n + 1). Then the\n\u2212k\u2212n\noperator on densities Pk : \u0393E\u03a3 [ k\u2212n\n2 ] \u2192 \u0393E\u03a3 [ 2 ] satisfies the following:\n\u2022 For k odd Pk is the zero operator.\n\u00012\n\u2022 For even k, with k \u2264 n, Pk is ( (\u22121)k (k \u2212 1)!!\ntimes) the order k GJMS\noperator Pk on (\u03a3, c\u03a3 ).\nThe proof of this is given in Section 6.1 below.\nRemark 4.6. For the ranges as discussed, (and in the spirit of e.g. [37, 49, 18]) we can view\nthe k-even Pk as giving holographic formulae for the GJMS operators. These are given\nas an explicit formula in terms of the ambient almost Einstein (or Poincar\u00e9\u2013Einstein)\nspace which has one higher dimension than the space where the operator acts.\n\n\fCalculus on conformally compact manifolds\n\n15\n\nIn the case of n odd the Theorem does not recover all the operators of [36]. This is\njust an issue of the extent to which the boundary conformal structure determines the\nambient metric g o . For example if go is the formal Poincar\u00e9 metric in the sense of [22, 40]\nthen Pk will be intrinsic for all k, and it is not difficult to argue (following [40]) that for\nall k \u2208 2Z\u22651 these are the GJMS operators.\nWe can now give a similar holographic formula for the Q-curvature.\no\n\nTheorem 4.7.

Note that in any dimension, and on any conformally compact manifold\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\nand\nformula (4.2) defines a curvature quantity Qg determined by the metric g\u03a3\nambient geometry. (Note that the first part of the Proof of Theorem 4.5 does not\nthat n is even, nor that go is Einstein.)

Pn = Pn defining Pn . When n is even it is reasonable to view this\nas a (in general non-intrinsic) generalisation of the Q-curvature.\nRemark 4.9. The Q-curvature as discussed above is sometimes called the critical Qcurvature since it is associated to the dimension order GJMS operators. Related scalar\ncurvature quantities associated to the other GJMS operators are sometimes called noncitical Q-curvatures and are also of interest for (for example) curvature prescription\nproblems [7]. In an obvious adaption of the ideas from Theorem 4.7, holographic formulae for these arise (at least up to the orders covered by Theorem 4.5) by applying the\n\u0011k\n\u0010\noperators \u2212 I12 I*D to a suitable power of \u03bc. We leave the details to the reader.\n\n\f16\n\nGover & Waldron\n\n5. The extension problems and their asymptotics\nHenceforth we consider a structure (M, c, \u03c3) with \u03c3 a defining density for a hypersurface \u03a3 and I 2 nowhere zero. We consider the problem of solving, off \u03a3 asymptotically,\nI*Df = 0 ,\n\u0393E \u03a6 [w0 ]\n\nfor f \u2208\nand some given weight w0 . For simplicity we henceforth calculate on the\nside of \u03a3 where \u03c3 is non-negative, so effectively this amounts to working locally along\nthe boundary of a conformally compact manifold.\n5.1. Solutions of the first kind. Here we treat an obvious Dirichlet-like problem where\nwe view f |\u03a3 as the initial data. Suppose that f0 is an arbitrary smooth extension of f |\u03a3\nto a section of E \u03a6 [w0 ] over M . We seek to solve the following problem:\n\nProblem 5.1. Given f |\u03a3 , and an arbitrary extension f0 of this to E \u03a6 [w0 ] over M , find\nfi \u2208 E \u03a6 [w0 \u2212 i] (over M ), i = 1, 2, * * * , so that\nf (l) := f0 + \u03c3f1 + \u03c3 2 f2 + * * * + O(\u03c3 l+1 )\n\nsolves I*Df = O(\u03c3 l ), off \u03a3, for l \u2208 N \u222a \u221e as high as possible.\n\nRemark 5.2. For i \u2265 1 we do not assume that the fi are necessarily non-vanishing\nalong \u03a3.\nWe write h0 = d + 2w0 so that hf0 = h0 f0 , for example. The existence or not of a\nsolution at generic weights is governed by the following result.\nLemma 5.3. Let f (l) be a solution of Problem 5.1 to order l \u2208 Z\u22650 . Then provided\nl 6= h0 \u2212 2 = n + 2w0 \u2212 1 there is an extension\nf (l+1) = f (l) + \u03c3 l+1 fl+1 ,\n\nunique modulo \u03c3 l+2 , which solves\nI*Df (l+1) = 0\n\nmodulo\n\nO(\u03c3 l+1 ).\n\nIf l = h0 \u2212 2 then the extension is obstructed by Pl+1 f0 |\u03a3 .\n\nProof. Note that I*Df = 0 is equivalent to \u2212 I12 I*Df = 0 and so we can recast this as\na formal problem using the Lie algebra < x, y, h > from Proposition 3.4.

It follows that the map f0 7\u2192 x\u2212l yf (l) is tangential and x\u2212l yf (l) |\u03a3 is\nthe obstruction to solving yf (l+1) = O(xl+1 ). By a simple induction this is seen to be a\nnon-zero multiple of y l+1 f0 |\u03a3 .\n\u0003\nThus by induction we conclude the following.\n\n\fCalculus on conformally compact manifolds\n\n17\n\nProposition 5.4.

Examining this applied to the terms \u03b1k\u22121 z k\u22121 +\u03b1k z k in the expansion\nof K(z) we immediately recover the equivalent recursion relation\nE=z\n\n(5.6)\n\nk(k \u2212 h0 + 1)\u03b1k + \u03b1k\u22121 = 0 ,\n\nwhich is solvable for \u03b1k , k \u2208 Z\u22651 , so long as h0 6= k + 1 = 2, 3, . . ..\nIn fact up to a simple change of variables and rescaling, the display (5.4) is Bessel's\nequation. Thus, away from the special weights h0 = 2, 3, . . . we have1\nh0 \u22121\n\u221a \u0001\n(5.7)\nK(z) = z 2 \u0393(2 \u2212 h0 ) J1\u2212h0 2 z .\n\n1The Bessel function of the first kind J (u) is defined for complex values u with |arg u| < \u03c0.

Readers familiar with [40] and related treatments of Poincar\u00e9\u2013Einstein\nasymptotics may recall an evenness property of the series expansions there. This feature\nappears as a consequence of the form of our solutions (see, for example, Proposition 5.5),\nwhere every appearance of the scale \u03c3 is accompanied by that of the operator I*D, both\nof which, upon making choices corresponding to the setting of [40], yields one power of\nthe coordinate around which their expansion is based.\n\nRemark 5.7. Curiously enough, in a different realisation of the sl(2) (as well as for higher\nrank g and super Lie algebras, where xy is replaced by products of generators x\u03b1 y\u03b1\nsummed over positive roots \u03b1), the same normal ordered expression as :K : (albeit at\ncertain fixed values of h0 ) appeared in the completely different contexts of higher spin systems and minisuperspace quantizations of supersymmetric black holes [12, 13, 14, 15, 8].\nThere the underlying representation of g is in terms of algebraic operations on tensors.\nThe normal ordered Bessel function :K : appeared, not as a solution generating operator, but instead was used to construct the differential in a complex whose cohomology\ndescribed either higher spin excitations or states in a quantized black hole.\nAt this point it is not yet evident how the formal solution :K(z):f0 depends on the\nchoice of f0 \u2208 E \u03a6 [w0 ] extending f0 |\u03a3 . This is settled as follows.\n\nProposition 5.8. The solution :K(z):f0 is independent of how f0 smoothly extends f |\u03a3\noff \u03a3, as a section of E \u03a6 [w0 ].\nProof. Let f1 \u2208 \u0393E \u03a6 [w0 \u2212 1]. Then xf1 \u2208 \u0393E \u03a6 [w0 ] and we consider\n\n:z k : xf1 = xk y k xf1 .\n\nUsing [y k , x] = \u2212y k\u22121 k(h \u2212 k + 1) from (3.1) we see that\n\u0001\n\u0001\nxk y k xf1 = \u2212x k(h0 \u2212 k \u2212 1)xk\u22121 y k\u22121 \u2212 xk y k f1 = x: k(k + 1 \u2212 h0 )z k\u22121 + z k : f1 .\n\nThus\n\n\u0001\n\nh1\n\n:K(z): x f1 = x : zK \u2032\u2032 \u2212 (h0 \u2212 2)K \u2032 + K : f1 = x :\n2The Pochhammer symbol k\n\n\u0001\n\nl\n\nz\n\ni\n\u0001\nE(E \u2212 h0 + 1) + z K(z) : f1 ,\n\n= k(k \u2212 1) * * * (k \u2212 l + 1) and (k)0 = 1.\n\n\fCalculus on conformally compact manifolds\n\n19\n\nand we note the equation (5.4) has again arisen. Since K(z) is a solution of this, the\nright-hand-side of the display vanishes.\n\u0003\nIn the following it will be convenient to annotate K(z) with h0 so that K h0 (z) indicates\nthe series in C[[z]] giving the solution operator on E \u03a6 [w0 ] (where h0 = d + 2w0 as usual).\n5.3. Solutions of the second kind. The equation (5.4), being second order, admits\na second independent homogeneous solution. This corresponds to another solution of\nthe I*D equation above, but to see this rigorously we first generalise (cf. Problem 5.1)\nour notion of solution as follows.\nProblem 5.9. Given f 0 |\u03a3 \u2208 \u0393E \u03a6 [w0 \u2212 \u03b1]|\u03a3 and an arbitrary extension f 0 of this to\n\u0393E \u03a6 [w0 \u2212 \u03b1] over M , find f i \u2208 E \u03a6 [w0 \u2212 \u03b1 \u2212 i] (over M ), i = 1, 2, * * * , so that\n\u0001\nf := \u03c3 \u03b1 f 0 + \u03c3 f 1 + \u03c3 2 f 2 + * * * + O(\u03c3 l+1 )\n(5.8)\nsolves I*Df = O(\u03c3 l+\u03b1 ), off \u03a3, for l \u2208 N \u222a \u221e as high as possible.\n\nAs usual we shall write I*Df = 0 as a shorthand for the statement that f is an l = \u221e\nsolution.\nThe exponent \u03b1, if not integral, takes Problem 5.9 outside the realm of the universal\nenveloping algebra U (g) and its modules. However \u03c3 = x \u2208 g is a smooth section of\nan oriented real line bundle and as such x\u03b1 is well defined for any complex \u03b1. What is\nmore, as follows from Remark 3.2, within the operator algebra Corollary 3.5 allows the\nextension\n(5.9)\n\n[x\u03b1 , y] = x\u03b1\u22121 \u03b1(h + \u03b1 \u2212 1).\n\nSince f 0 may be non-vanishing along \u03a3 it follows immediately from (5.9) that I*Df = 0\nhas no solution unless\n\u03b1 = 0 or \u03b1 = h0 \u2212 1,\nwhere hf = h0 f . Since \u03b1 = 0 is the case of the extension problem treated above, we\nset here \u03b1 := h0 \u2212 1.\nLet us write h0 for the h-weight of f 0 . Observe that since\nh(x\u03b1 f 0 ) = h0 (x\u03b1 f 0 ), it follows that\nNow write\n\n1 \u2212 h0 = h0 \u2212 1.\n\nG(z) = 1 + \u03b21 z + \u03b22 z 2 + * * *\nfor the element of C[[z]] so that\n\n:G(z): = 1 + \u03b21 xy + \u03b22 x2 y 2 + * * * ,\n\nand (x\u03b1 :G(z):) : E \u03a6 [w0 \u2212 \u03b1] \u2192 E \u03a6 [w0 ] is the putative solution operator (with : :\nthe normal ordering as before). Following the ideas above we now seek an ODE that\ndetermines G. But note that since \u03b1 = h0 \u2212 1 then, on E \u03a6 [w0 \u2212 \u03b1], we have y x\u03b1 :G(z): =\nx\u03b1 y :G(z): . Thus, upon the replacement of h0 with h0 , we are in fact reduced to the\nsame ODE\n\u0001\n(5.10)\n(zG\u2032 )\u2032 \u2212 (h0 \u2212 1)G\u2032 + G = 0 \u21d4\nE(E \u2212 h0 + 1) + z G(z) = 0,\nas in (5.4). It follows that G(z) is given by (5.7) with this replacement, that is\n1\u2212h0\nh0 \u22121\n\u221a \u0001\n\u221a \u0001\n(5.11)\nG(z) = K h0 (z) = z 2 \u0393(2 \u2212 h0 ) J1\u2212h0 2 z = z 2 \u0393(h0 ) Jh0 \u22121 2 z .\n\nRemark 5.10. Using Ez \u03b1 = z \u03b1 (E + \u03b1), It is easily verified that z \u03b1 G(z) is a (\"second\")\nsolution to (5.4).\n\n\f20\n\nGover & Waldron\n\nFor the record we note that, in terms of the weight h0 , the ODE (5.10) is\n(5.12)\n\n(zG\u2032 )\u2032 + (h0 \u2212 1)G\u2032 + G = 0.\n\nExpressed alternatively, we wish to solve\n\u0001\nE(E + h0 \u2212 1) + z G(z) = 0,\n\nwhich leads to the equivalent recursion relation\n\nk(k + h0 \u2212 1)\u03b2k + \u03b2k\u22121 = 0 .\nThis is solvable for \u03b2k , k \u2208 Z\u22651 , now with the restriction h0 6= 1 \u2212 k = 0, \u22121, . . ..\nPutting together the results from Section 5.2 and Section 5.3 we summarise as follows.\nProposition 5.11. Problem 5.9 has a solution only if \u03b1 = 0 or \u03b1 = h0 \u2212 1. If \u03b1 = 0\nand h0 \u2208\n/ Z\u22652 then an infinite order solution is given by\n(5.13)\n\nf0 7\u2192 :K h0 : f0 ,\n\nwhere f0 is any section of E \u03a6 [w0 ] smoothly extending f0 |\u03a3 \u2208 E \u03a6 [w0 ]|\u03a3 .\nIf \u03b1 = h0 \u2212 1 and h0 \u2208\n/ Z\u22640 then an infinite order solution is given by\n(5.14)\n\nf 0 7\u2192 xh0 \u22121 :K h0 : f 0 ,\n\nwhere f 0 is any smooth extension of f 0 |\u03a3 to a section of E \u03a6 [\u2212d \u2212 w0 + 1].\nIn each case the solution is independent of how f0 (respectively f 0 ) extends f |\u03a3 (respectively f |\u03a3 ) off \u03a3. Thus (5.13) and (5.14) determine well-defined solution operators\n(:K h0 :) : \u0393E \u03a6 [w0 ]|\u03a3 \u2192 \u0393E \u03a6 [w0 ] ,\nand\n(xh0 \u22121 :K h0 :) : \u0393E \u03a6 [w0 \u2212 h0 + 1]|\u03a3 \u2192 \u0393E \u03a6 [w0 ] .\n\nFor h0 \u2208\n/ Z the solutions (5.13) and (5.14) are distinct if f0 |\u03a3 and f 0 |\u03a3 are not zero.\nFurther any formal solution f \u2208 \u0393E \u03a6 [w0 ] of the equation I*Df = 0 (off \u03a3) is a linear\ncombination of solutions of the form (5.13) and (5.14).\nRemark 5.12. When h0 is a positive integer the second solution (5.14) still provides an\ninfinite order solution to Problem 5.9. Moreover, this is an instance of the situation\nwhere one can compose tangential operators: for positive integer h0 , the second solution\nalso furnishes a solution to a modified version of Problem 5.9\nf0 7\u2192 xh0 \u22121 :K h0 : y h0 \u22121 f0 ,\n\nwhere instead of f 0 |\u03a3 , one is given an f0 |\u03a3 \u2208 \u0393E \u03a6 [w0 ]|\u03a3 and an arbitrary extension f0\nof this to \u0393E \u03a6 [w0 ] over M . Again, this solution is independent of how f0 extends f0 |\u03a3\noff \u03a3.\nFinally, note that h0 = 1 (i.e. w0 = \u2212 d\u22121\n2 ) is allowed for both (5.13) and (5.14),\nbut in this case they coincide. This amounts to the situation of a repeated root of the\nindicial equation for the Frobenius method for second order ODEs. This suggests a new\nsecond solution, perhaps of the form F (\u03c3) log \u03c3, where F (\u03c3) is again a power series type\nsolution. The weights h0 \u2208 Z \\ {1} should also be dealt with by log terms. With \u03c3 a\nsection of E+ [1] we can make sense of log \u03c3 using the notion of log-densities developed in\nSection 2.1.\n\n\fCalculus on conformally compact manifolds\n\n21\n\n5.4. Solutions with log terms. We now consider the case of weights h0 \u2208 Z. From\nabove we see that for each such weight there is just one smooth solution, i.e. solution to\nProblem 5.9. In view of the symmetry between the cases of weights h0 and h0 it suffices\nto treat the case of h0 \u2208 Z\u22651 .\nWe shall assume that (M, c, \u03c3) is conformally compact with \u03c3 \u2265 0. Recalling the\ndiscussion of log density bundles from Section 2.1 we note that log \u03c3 is then well defined\non the interior of M , where \u03c3 > 0, and we include log \u03c3 = log x into our formal computations. Since we understand pointwise the meaning of complex linear operations on log\ndensities we can take the tensor product of F[w] with vector bundles, and in particular\nweighted tractor bundles.\nA slight subtlety arises at this point, because log \u03c3 is not an eigen-section for the\nweight operator, cf. (2.3). Thus we introduce a second scale: let \u03c4 denote some true\nscale on M , i.e. \u03c4 \u2208 \u0393E[1] is nowhere zero on M ; in particular \u03c4 |\u03a3 gives a scale on \u03a3,\nand we may write g \u03c4 for the metric \u03c4 \u22122 g on M determined by \u03c4 .\nProblem 5.13. Let h0 = d + 2w0 be in Z\u22652 . Given non-zero f0 |\u03a3 \u2208 \u0393E \u03a6 [w0 ]|\u03a3 and an\narbitrary extension f0 of this to \u0393E \u03a6 [w0 ] over M , find fi \u2208 E \u03a6 [w0 \u2212 i], i = 1, 2, * * * , and\nf j \u2208 E \u03a6 [\u2212d \u2212 w0 + 1 \u2212 j] (over M ), j = 0, 1, * * * , so that\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(5.15)\nf := f0 + \u03c3f1 + * * * + \u03c3 h0 \u22121 (log \u03c3 \u2212 log \u03c4 ) f 0 + \u03c3f 1 + * * * + O(\u03c3 l+1 )\n\nsolves I*Df = O(\u03c3 l ), off \u03a3, for l \u2208 N \u222a \u221e as high as possible. More precisely, if\nl \u2265 h0 \u2212 1 then the display should also include + O(\u03c3 l+1 log \u03c3), meaning up to the\naddition of a formally smooth term tensor product with \u03c3 l+1 log \u03c3, and then we seek to\nsolve I*Df = O(\u03c3 l ) + O(\u03c3 l log \u03c3), for l as high as possible.\nIf h0 = 1 we seek instead a solution with f 0 |\u03a3 not zero and taken as the initial data,\nand f0 = 0.\nRemark 5.14. Three comments on the statement of Problem 5.13 are important:\nFirst note that we have explicitly entered a second scale, viz. the scale \u03c4 that extends\nto the boundary. Although we may treat the I*D equation without doing this, the\nmanoeuvre is necessary if we require that f is an eigenfunction of the weight operator\n(enabling the interior relation (2.10)). Note that log \u03c3 \u2212 log \u03c4 = log r is a function.\n\nSecond we have decreed where the log terms enter by adding a term of the form \u03c3 h0 \u22121\nlog \u03c3 f. Alternatively we could have added \u03c3 \u03b2 log \u03c3 f for some \u03b2. It is straightforward to\nthen show that \u03b2 = h0 \u2212 1 is forced.\nThird, in the statement of the problem we have stipulated that log \u03c4 appear in the\ncombination log \u03c3 \u2212 log \u03c4 . Although we cannot relax this requirement, we shall see that\nthe simplest presentation of the solution is not explicitly in this form, but differs by terms\ninvolving various reorderings of the operators y and log \u03c4 .\nRemark 5.15. Allowing f0 = 0, Problem 5.13 always has a solution of the second kind\n(discussed in Section 5.3) with the leading power of \u03c3 equaling the integer h0 \u2212 1. It\nis given by the formula xh0 \u22121 :K 2\u2212h0 (z):fh0\u22121 where fh0 \u22121 |\u03a3 \u2208 \u0393E \u03a6 [\u2212d \u2212 w0 + 1]|\u03a3\nand fh0 \u22121 is an arbitrary extension of this to \u0393E \u03a6 [\u2212d \u2212 w0 + 1] over M . In the following\ndiscussion, we focus on the case of vanishing fh0 \u22121 ; this term will be supplanted by the\nleading coefficient of the logarithm f 0 (which is of the same weight as fh0 \u22121 ).\nLet us write\nf := f0 + xf1 + x2 f2 + * * *\n\n\f22\n\nGover & Waldron\n\nand\nf := f 0 + x f 1 + x2 f 2 + * * * .\nThus we seek a solution of the form\n(5.16)\n\nf + xh0 \u22121 (log x \u2212 log \u03c4 ) f .\n\nTo determine the equations on f and f we need to draw log x into our operator algebra.\nFormally, the identity\nxk \u2212 1\nlim\n= log x\nk\u21920\nk\ncoupled with the relations [h, x] = 2x and [y, xk ] = \u2212xk\u22121 k(h+k\u22121) from Proposition 3.4\nand Corollary 3.5 suggest that\n(5.17)\n\n[h, log x] = 2 ,\n\n[y, log x] = \u2212x\u22121 (h \u2212 1) .\n\nThe first of these relations does hold rather generally; if \u03bc \u2208 \u0393E+ [w0 ] is any positive\nweighted conformal density, then log \u03bc is a weighted log density, viz. a section of F[w0 ]\nand, by virtue of (2.3) obeys\n[h, log \u03bc] = 2w0\nread as an operator relation acting on any section of a weighted tractor bundle. The second relation in (5.17) can be easily proven using ambient tractor machinery, as provided\nby Proposition 6.1. It also holds on arbitrary sections of weighted tractor bundles. In\nfact both relations in (5.17) can be shown (again by ambient techniques) to hold also\non log densities or tensor products of these with conformal densities, or more generally\non a log density tensor product with any weighted tractor bundle. In the remainder of\nthis Section we will develop various consequences of the above identities, with the same\nrange of validity, and state them without explicit reference to the class of sections on\nwhich they act.\nNow we apply y to (5.16). Since the weight of f is such that [y, xh0 \u22121 ]f = 0,\nand similarly [y, xh0 \u22121 ](log x \u2212 log \u03c4 )f = 0 new terms arise only from the commutator\n[y, log x \u2212 log \u03c4 ]. Thus the equation from y applied to (5.16) is\n\u0003\n\u0002\n(5.18)\n0 = y f \u2212 1 \u2212 h0 xh0 \u22122 f + xh0 \u22121 (log x y \u2212 y log \u03c4 ) f .\n\nSome observations greatly simplify the analysis of this. First it is not difficult to see that\nthe log x terms must vanish separately and so\ny f = 0.\n\nGiven the weight of f we know that there is a formal power series type solution of the\nform f = :F (z): f 0 , so we obtain the equation on F (z) from (5.12):\n\u0002\n\u0003\n(5.19)\nE(E + h0 \u2212 1) + z F (z) = 0 .\nFrom Section 5.3 this is solvable for h0 \u2208 Z\u22651 , yielding\n\n(5.20)\n\nF (z) = K h0 (z).\n\nAt this point our proposed solution (5.16) reads\nf + xh0 \u22121 (log x \u2212 log \u03c4 ) :K h0 (z): f 0\nand we have as yet not determined f or f 0 . Our second observation is that we may\nmodify the expression (5.16) and seek a formal solution of the form\n\u0001\n(5.21)\nf + xh0 \u22121 log x :K h0 (z): \u2212 :K h0 (z): log \u03c4 f 0 ,\n\n\fCalculus on conformally compact manifolds\n\n23\n\nbecause moving log \u03c4 past the operator :K h0 (z): produces terms, each of a well-defined\nweight, which can be absorbed into the as yet undetermined f at orders higher than xh0 \u22121 .\nThe utility of this manoeuvre will soon be clear.\nNext we upgrade the identity (5.3) to an operator relation for formal solution operators\n:K(z): \u2208 C[[z]],\n\u0001\n(5.22)\ny :K(z): = : zK \u2032\u2032 (z) + 2K \u2032 (z) + K(z) : y \u2212 :K \u2032 (z): yh .\n\nUsing this, as well as (2.3) and the fact that (5.20) solves (5.19), we find that the equation\narising from the modified expression for our proposed solution (5.21) is\ni\nh\ndK h0 (z)\n: yf 0 .\n(5.23)\ny f = 1 \u2212 h0 xh0 \u22122 :K h0 (z): f 0 \u2212 2 xh0 \u22121 :\ndz\n\nNotice that for any f 0 all log terms have dropped out leaving an inhomogeneous equation\nfor f. Settling this up to terms of order xh0 \u22122 is the problem\ni\nh\n(5.24)\ny f = 1 \u2212 h0 xh0 \u22122 :K h0 (z): f 0 + O(xh0 \u22121 ).\n\nHere we see that there are two cases h0 = 1, and h0 \u2208 Z\u22652 . We treat the latter first.\nFor h0 \u2208 Z\u22652 , and f0 |\u03a3 non-zero, the equation (5.24) can be treated in two stages.\nThe first of these consists of solving y f = O(xh0 \u22122 ). This is simply an initial finite part\nof the Problem 5.1 treated in Section 5.1. Thus we obtain a solution (the unique solution\nto the given order, if f0 |\u03a3 is assumed not zero) f = :Fh0 \u22122 (z): f0 + O(xh0 \u22122 ) where the\npolynomial Fh0 \u22122 (z), arising as the operator expressing the partial sum up of terms up\nto order xh0 \u22122 in f, obeys\n\u0002\n\u0003\nE(E \u2212 h0 + 1) + z Fh0 \u22122 (z) = O(z h0 \u22122 ) .\nExplicitly\n(5.25)\n\nFh0 \u22122 (z) = 1 +\n\nz\nz2\nz h0 \u22122\n+\n+ *** +\n\u00012 ,\nh0 \u2212 2 2!(h0 \u2212 2)(h0 \u2212 3)\n(h0 \u2212 2)!\n\nwhich amounts to solving (5.6) when k = 1, 2, . . . , h0 \u2212 2. So\n1\n\nh \u22122 h \u22121\n\u0001 2 x 0 y 0 f0 .\n(h0 \u2212 2)!\n\u0002\n\u0003\nNow inspecting (5.6) we see the following: the equation : E(E \u2212 h0 + 1) + z F (z) :f0 = 0\ncannot be solved to higher order in general, with the tangential operator y h0 \u22121 f0 =\nPh0 \u22121 f0 (of Theorem 4.1) the obstruction (if this vanishes we may continue, cf. Lemma 5.3\nand Proposition 5.4). At the next order f 0 provides the rescue in (5.24), in that (5.24)\ncan be solved by setting\n1\nf0 = \u2212\ny h0 \u22121 f0 .\n(5.27)\n(h0 \u2212 1)!(h0 \u2212 2)!\n\n(5.26)\n\ny :Fh0 \u22122 (z) :f0 =\n\nEquation (5.23) is now solved canonically to all higher orders as follows. We extend\nf = :Fh0 \u22122 (z): f0 + O(xh0 \u22121 ) by first setting the undetermined coefficient of xh0 \u22121 to\nzero. (Note that any other choice is tantamount to adding to our solution a non-trivial\nsolution of the second kind, as discussed in Remark 5.15.) By (5.27) f 0 is determined\nby f0 , whence so the right-hand-side of (5.23) as a power series type expansion in x.\nNow in equation (5.23) we have dealt with all terms below order xh0 \u22121 . But after this\nthe equation is solvable recursively, since it is simply an inhomogeneous version of the\n\n\f24\n\nGover & Waldron\n\nrecursion relation (5.6) of the form k(k \u2212 h0 + 1)\u03b1k + \u03b1k\u22121 = rk\u22121 , k = h0 , h0 + 1, * * * ,\nwhere rk indicates terms corresponding to the right-hand-side of (5.23).\nIn fact, this last problem can be neatly formulated in terms of an inhomogeneous\nordinary differential equation along the lines of (5.4). This surprisingly enables a complete\nand explicit solution to the problem. In total the treatment involves several subtleties;\nto reveal and deal with each of these we break the treatment into a number of stages.\nThe first step is that we express also the O(xh0 ) terms in f in the solution generating\noperator language\nf = :Fh0 \u22122 (z): f0 + xh0 :B(z): yf 0 ,\n\n(5.28)\n\nwhere it now only remains to determine B(z) \u2208 C[[z]] (here f 0 is given as in (5.27)).\nInserting this, along with (5.26) and (5.27) into our equation (5.23) gives\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\ndK h0 (z) \u0011\n: f0 .\nxh0 \u22122 (1 \u2212 h0 ) + xy :zB(z): f 0 = xh0 \u22122 : (1 \u2212 h0 ) K h0 (z) \u2212 2 z\ndz\n\nHere we used Corollary (3.5) and the fact that f 0 \u2208 E \u03a6 [\u2212d \u2212 w0 + 1], along with the\nsimple operator identity x :K(z): y = :zK(z): for any K(z) \u2208 C[[z]]. We can solve this\nequation using the formal solution operator methods explained in Section 5.1 (and in\nparticular equation (5.3)). This gives the inhomogeneous, linear ODE\n\u0001\n(5.29)\nE(E + h0 \u2212 1) + z [zB(z)] = \u2212(2E + h0 \u2212 1)[K h0 (z) \u2212 1] .\nClearly the Frobenius method yields a unique formal solution for B(z), the leading terms\nof which we explicate below\nB(z) =\n\nh0 +1\nh20\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\n(h0 +2)(3h0 +1)\n4h20 (h0 +1)2\n\n\u03b3k\n\n(h0 +3)(11h20 +18h0 +4)\n36h20 (h0 +1)2 (h0 +2)2\n\n(h0 +4)(25h30 +98h20 +99h0 +18)\n288h20 (h0 +1)2 (h0 +2)2 (h0 +3)2\n\nThe solution to all orders for B(z) =\n\u03b30 =\n\nz +\n\nh0 + 1\n,\nh20\n\nP\u221e\n\nk=0 \u03b3k z\n\nk\n\nz2\n\nz3 + * * * .\n\n\u2208 C[[z]] is given by the recurrence\n\n\"\n#\n(\u22121)k+1 (h0 + 2k + 1)\n1\n\u0001\n\u03b3k\u22121 +\n.\n= \u2212\n(k + 1)(h0 + k)\n(k + 1)! h0 + k k+1\n\nRemark 5.16.

However, we have not yet reached the ideal solution to the\nproblem (5.13). The point here is that (5.30) is not independent of how f0 is extended\noff \u03a3 from given boundary data f0 |\u03a3 \u2208 \u0393E \u03a6 [w0 ]|\u03a3 . This statement is readily verified by\nb 1 for some f1 \u2208 \u0393E \u03a6 [w0 \u2212 1]\nexplicitly computing Oxf\nh0 \u22122 K h0 (z): f\n1\nb xf1 = x :z\nO\n.\n\u00012\n(h0 \u2212 2)!\n\n(5.32)\n\nThe last computation relied on the second relation in Corollary 3.5 as well as analog of\nthe identity (5.22), adapted to the case where the operator x appears on the right, rather\nthan y on the left, namely\n\u0001\n(5.33)\n:K(z): x = x : zK \u2032\u2032 (z) + K(z) : \u2212 x :K \u2032 (z): h .\n\nThere is however, no analog of the second relation in (5.17) for the commutator of the\noperator y with log x, because x and log \u03c4 simply commute. This absence precisely\nexplains the leftover terms in (5.32) whilst at same time suggests a possible remedy.\nb given above, we see that there is a complete symmetry between\nExamining the operator O\nthe operator x on the left and y on the right (remembering that :z k : = xk y k ) except for\nwhere log \u03c4 appears in the place where symmetry would have suggested a term \"\u2212 log y\".\nRemarkably it is possible to adjust (5.30) in such a way that \u2212 log \u03c4 does effectively\nplay the r\u00f4le of the logarithm of y for the algebraic purposes required. Remembering\nthat we may always add some amount of a solution of the second kind, to the one\nobtained already in (5.30), we find that gives us sufficient leeway to perform such a\nmanoeuvre. Our cure begins by observing that for any section f 0 of E \u03a6 [\u2212d \u2212 w0 + 1] (so\nthat hf 0 = (2 \u2212 h0 )f 0 = h0 f 0 ) we have the identity\n[y, xh0 \u22121 log x] f 0 = (1 \u2212 h0 ) xh0 \u22122 f 0 ,\n\n(5.34)\n\nwhich was obtained using Corollary 3.5 and the algebra of y with log x in (5.17). What\nwe would like is a close analog of this result for commutators of the operator x with log \u03c4\nand powers of y. While a priori the existence of such is not at all guaranteed, it turns\nout that the Weyl averaged operator\n\u0001\nlog \u03c4 y h0 \u22121 + y h0 \u22121 log \u03c4\n,\nh0 \u2208 Z\u22651 ,\n(5.35)\nlog \u03c4 y h0 \u22121 W :=\n2\nobeys\ni\nh\n\u0001\n(5.36)\nlog \u03c4 y h0 \u22121 W , x f1 = (1 \u2212 h0 ) y h0 \u22122 f1 ,\n\nwhere f1 is any section of E \u03a6 [w0 \u2212 1] (so that hf1 = (h0 \u2212 2)f1 ). The validity of the\nidentity (5.34) is essentially the reason why the introduction of the logarithm of x enabled\nb in (5.30) annihilated by the action of y from the left.\nus to write the solution operator O\nThe new identity (5.36) exactly mimics that result, for the case now of x acting from the\nright. This leads us to the new solution generating operator:\nO = :Fh0 \u22122 (z): \u2212\n\n(5.37)\n\n\u2212\n\n:z h0 B(z):\n(h0 \u2212 1)!(h0 \u2212 2)!\n\nxh0 \u22121 log x :K h0 (z): y h0 \u22121 \u2212 xh0 \u22121 :K h0 (z): log \u03c4 y h0 \u22121\n(h0 \u2212 1)!(h0 \u2212 2)!\n\n\u0001\n\nW\n\n.\n\n\f26\n\nGover & Waldron\n\nIt is then a matter of straightforward algebra, using the relations (5.34), or (5.36), along\nwith (5.22), or (5.33), to establish the critical properties\ny Of0 = 0,\n\nand Oxf1 = 0,\n\nfor arbitrary sections f0 and f1 of E \u03a6 [w0 ] and E \u03a6 [w0 \u2212 1], respectively. In fact for the\nb 0 and\ncase of verifying yOf0 = 0, this also follows from (5.31), since by construction Of\nOf0 differ by a solution of the second kind. For the case of showing Oxf1 = 0 we follow\nthe idea of Proposition 5.8, although the situation here is significantly more delicate: It\nis straightforward to verify that, through the judicious introduction of the Weyl averaged\nexpression (5.35) in (5.37), we are again led to the equation (5.29) on zB(z); the equation\nwhich B(z) solves, by its definition. At this juncture, we also note that an easy variant\nof the computation directly above shows that replacing log \u03c4 by log \u03c4 + x t1 where t1 is\nany section of E[\u22121] does not change the solution Of0 . In other words, the solution only\ndepends on initial data \u03c4 |\u03a3 and is independent of the choice of extension of this to E[1]\nover M .\nRemark 5.17. One might wonder whether, by making a distinguished choice of second\nscale \u03c4 , it could be possible to avoid introducing the Weyl ordered combination of operators y and log \u03c4 defined in (5.35). In fact it is straightforward to prove that y and log \u03c4\ndo not commute when I 2 is non-vanishing.\nNow for the case h0 = 1: We again search for a formal solution of the form (5.21) with\nh0 = 1, but recall in this instance we take f 0 |\u03a3 as the given initial data. This is required\nby (5.23) since the first term on the right-hand-side now vanishes. We determine directly\nf in terms of f 0 using (5.20). Then we write f as in (5.28) but without the first term\nsince f0 = 0 here. Thus the expansion of f is given in terms of B(z), which (as for higher\nh0 cases) is determined by the inhomogeneous ODE (5.29). To ensure that the solution\nis independent of how f 0 |\u03a3 is extended off \u03a3 we use the same Weyl averaging technique\nas above. Thus, in this case, the solution generating operator is given by the numerators\nof the second and third terms in (5.37), evaluated at h0 = 1.\nWe have by now established the following\nTheorem 5.18.

The case of (M, c, \u03c3) being Poincar\u00e9-Einstein. For Problem 5.13 we found\nthat the coefficient of log \u03c3 satisfies\n1\nPh \u22121 f0\nf0 = \u2212\n(h0 \u2212 1)!(h0 \u2212 2)! 0\nwhere Pk is the tangential operator from Theorem 4.1. Any other solution of the I*Df = 0\nequation, is a linear combination of this with a solution of Problem 5.9.\nIt is interesting to note the specialisations that arise if (M, c, \u03c3) is a Poincar\u00e9-Einstein\nstructure, which we now assume here. Then the scale tractor I is parallel, and the\ninterior is Einstein. This means that on the interior (M+ , c) the powers of I*D give\nthe interior GJMS operators, when acting on densities of the appropriate weight. This\nfeatures precisely as follows.\nSuppose that j \u2208 Z\u22651 and h0 = 2j and so f0 has conformal weight w0 = j \u2212 d2 . Using\nthat (M, c, \u03c3) is conformally Einstein, from [26] we have that y j f0 = xj Yj f0 where (up to\na constant) Yj is the order 2j GJMS operator (in general in fact the generalisation thereof\nto a tractor twisted version) on (M, c). Thus y h0 \u22121 f0 = y j\u22121 xj Yj f0 and using (3.1) this\nis O(x). Thus by (5.27) f 0 |\u03a3 = 0 and by Proposition 5.8, also :K h0 : f 0 = 0. Thus the\ncanonical solution has no log terms.\nIn summary, if (M, go ) is Poincar\u00e9\u2013Einstein then:\n\u2022 If h0 = 3, 5, 7, . . ., then Ph \u22121 is the (tractor twisted) GJMS operator.\n0\n\u2022\n\nIf h0 = 2, 4, 6, . . ., then Ph0 \u22121 is trivial, f 0 = 0 and there are no log terms in the\ncanonical solution.\n\nFinally recall that we introduced the scale choice \u03c4 so that we could describe a solution\nwith a well-defined conformal weight, despite the presence of log terms. Having solved the\nproblem it is most natural to finally express the answer in the scale determined by \u03c4 , that\nis in terms of the metric g \u03c4 := \u03c4 \u22121 g. In this trivialisation of the weight bundles, \u03c4 itself\nis represented by the constant function 1. Then since log 1 = 0 the expression, in this\nscale, for the solution is obtained from that found above by simply formally replacing \u03c3\nand its powers by r = \u03c3/\u03c4 and its powers.\n5.5. The log density problem. We now consider the problem of formally solving\nI*D U = 0\nfor a log density U \u2208 \u0393F[1]. We again treat a Dirichlet type problem where U |\u03a3 is\nthe initial data. Given an arbitrary smooth extension U0 \u2208 \u0393F[1] of U |\u03a3 we study the\nfollowing problem:\nProblem 5.20. Given U0 |\u03a3 and an arbitrary extension of this to F[1] over M , find Ui \u2208\nE[\u2212i] (over M , i \u2208 Z\u22651 ), such that\nU (l) := U0 + \u03c3 U1 + \u03c3 2 U2 + * * * + O(\u03c3 l+1 )\n\nsolves I*D U = O(\u03c3 l ), off \u03a3, for l \u2208 N \u222a \u221e as high as possible.\n\nRemark 5.21. Since the sum of a log density and weight 0 conformal density (i.e., a\nfunction) is again a log density, all terms in the expansion Ui with i \u2265 1 are taken to be\nconformal densities with weight such that the product \u03c3 i Ui is a weight zero conformal\ndensity. Moreover, since I*D U0 is a weight \u22121 conformal density (even though U0 is a\n\n\f28\n\nGover & Waldron\n\nlog density), the solution to the above problem can be achieved by applying the results\ndeveloped in previous sections for conformal densities, in particular those for h0 = d\n(because then w0 = 0).\nIn light of the above remark, from Theorem 5.18 we directly obtain the following\nCorollary 5.22. Problem 5.20 has a canonical infinite order solution with\n(U0 , \u03c4 ) 7\u2192 O|h0 =d f0 ,\nwhere U0 and \u03c4 are, respectively, any sections of F[1] and E[1] and the solution operator\nO|h0 =d is precisely the one given in (5.37) save that h0 is set to the value h0 = d.\nThe solution O|h0 =d U0 is independent of how \u03c4 as well as U0 extends f |\u03a3 (respectively f |\u03a3 ) off \u03a3 and thus determines a well-defined solution operator\n\u0001\nO|h0 =d : \u0393F[1]|\u03a3 , \u0393E[1]|\u03a3 \u2192 \u0393F[1] .\n\nRemark 5.23. In the spirit of Remark 5.19 above some comments, extending the Corollary, are worthwhile. These again use Theorem 5.18.\nFirst note that, in the solution, the coefficient of log \u03c3 is\n(5.40)\n\n\u2212\n\n1\nPn U0\n(n)!(n \u2212 1)!\n\nwhere Pn is the tangential operator from Theorem 4.1. It is natural to consider this in\nthe case that U0 = \u2212 log \u03bc\u0303, where \u03bc\u0303 is some extension to \u0393E+ [1] of a section \u03bc \u2208 \u0393E+ [1]|\u03a3\nso that U0 \u2208 F[\u22121]. (Recall that for log densities pointwise multiplication is a bundle\nisomorphism, so here we are simply multiplying the entire solution by a factor \u22121.)\nThen specialising to the case of (M, c, \u03c3) Poincar\u00e9-Einstein we have I 2 = 1, and\nfrom (2.11) we see that in the interior scale the problem being solved is\no\n\n\u2212 \u2206g U = n,\n\n(5.41)\n\nIn this case, from Theorem 4.7, we get\n\u2022\n\nIf n is even then the log coefficient (5.40) is\n\u03bc\n\nQg \u03a3\n2n\u22121\n\u03bc\n\n\u2022\n\nn\n2\n\n\u0001\n\u22121 !\n\nn\n2\n\n\u0001\n\n!\n\n\u03bc\n.\nwhere Qg\u03a3 is the Q-curvature of g\u03a3\nIf n is odd then the log term vanishes, and the solution is smooth.\n\nIn fact (5.41) is precisely the problem studied by [21] and [23] (noting the different sign\nof Laplacian these sources use) and these results are consistent with their findings.\n5.6. The formal solutions in the interior scale. Summarising the above, away from\nthe weights w0 = { j\u2212d\n2 | j \u2208 Z\u22651 }, we found two independent formal solutions to the\nequation I*Df = 0 along \u03a3. These take the form\nF = f0 + \u03c3f1 + * * * and \u03c3 h0 \u22121 G = \u03c3 h0 \u22121 (f 0 + \u03c3f 1 + * * * ) ,\n\neach of which is a density valued section of E \u03a6 [w0 ] with w0 \u2208\n/ { j\u2212d\n2 | j \u2208 Z\u22651 }.\nWe may eliminate the weight by choosing a scale \u03c4 \u2208 \u0393E[1] which extends to the\nboundary \u03a3, so equivalently a metric g = \u03c4 \u22122 g \u2208 c. Then the solutions, in terms of the\nscale g, are F g = \u03c4 \u2212w0 F and Gg = \u03c4 \u2212w0 G in E \u03a6 = E \u03a6 [0]. Note that r := \u03c3/\u03c4 is the\n\n\fCalculus on conformally compact manifolds\n\n29\n\nfunction r which gives the density \u03c3 in the scale \u03c4 . Thus working in the metric g the\nsolutions take the form\n\u0002\n\u0003g\nF g = f0 + rf1 + * * * and \u03c3 h0 \u22121 G = r h0 \u22121 (f 0 + rf 1 + * * * )\n\nwhere now the fi and f i are of weight 0 (but we have retained the earlier notation for\nsimplicity). Explicit expressions for the unweighted tractor fields fi and f i follow from\nProposition 5.11.\nOn the other hand, for the purpose of comparison with the existing literature, it is\ninteresting to understand the solutions in terms of the canonical generalised scale \u03c3.\no\no\nAway from \u03a3, we have F g = \u03c3 \u2212w0 F or in terms of the scale g, F g = r \u2212w0 F g , and\no\ng\nsimilarly for f which may then be expressed in terms of Gg . Thus, in terms of the\ncanonical scale g o , a general formal solution takes the form\nf = r n\u2212s F g + r s Gg\n\nwhere, recall, s := w0 + n. This equation (specialized to conformal densities rather than\ngeneric tractors), alongside the expression (2.10) for the I*D operator in the scale go ,\ngives a precise dictionary between our methods and the scattering problem stated in\nequation 3.2 of [40].\n\u22122 g\nAt weights w0 \u2208 { j\u2212d\n2 | j \u2208 Z\u22651 } where log solutions appear, for the scale g = \u03c4\nwe take the density \u03c4 extending to the boundary to be the same as that appearing in\nthe log terms in (5.15). In that choice of scale \u03c4 itself is represented by the constant\nfunction 1, thus a similar analysis to above shows that in the scale g o we have solutions\nof the form\n(5.42)\n\ng\n\nf = r n\u2212s Fhg0 \u22122 + r s log r F + r s+1 B g + r s Gg ,\n\n| j \u2208 Z\u22651 }, the field Gg (the \"second solution\" part) is of the form\nwhere now s \u2208 { j+n\u22121\n2\ng\n\nas above, and the fields Fhg0 \u22122 , F and B g take the form\nFhg0 \u22122 = f0 + rf1 + * * * + r 2s\u2212n\u22121 f2s\u2212n\u22121 ,\n\ng\n\nF = f 0 + rf 1 + * * *\n\nand\nB g = b0 + rb1 + * * * .\n\nThese last three mentioned terms are really part of the single log type solution and the\ndetails can be explicitly read off from Theorem 5.18. In the special case s = n2 (so\nthat h0 = 1), the polynomial term Fhg0 \u22122 is omitted. For comparison with the existing\nliterature, note that the non-log terms r n\u2212s Fhg0 \u22122 , r s+1 B g , and r s Gg in (5.42) could be\nswept together into a single term of the form r n\u2212s F , with F of the form f0 + rf1 + * * * ,\nso we have\ng\nf = r n\u2212s F + r s log r F ,\nbut this hides how independent solutions combine to give the general solution.\nContinuing in this weight range w0 \u2208 { j\u2212d\n2 | j \u2208 Z\u22651 }, for almost Einstein structures\n|\n(e.g. Poincar\u00e9-Einstein, the case considered in [40]), when h0 is even so s \u2208 { j+n\u22121\n2\nj \u2208 2Z\u22651 }) there are no log terms in the solution, as explained in Remark 5.19. Indeed,\nin [19, 40], by differing methods, the authors found a log obstruction only for 2s \u2212 n\neven. Also, essentially, the same analysis as above applied to the log density problem of\nSection 5.5 confirms the form of solution predicted for the equivalent interior problem\nformulated in [21].\n\n\f30\n\nGover & Waldron\n\nFinally, to complete a circle of ideas, let us write out the operator I*D in the scale \u03c4\nsuch that the function r above is a defining function in the sense of [38]. In that case the\nmetric g o = rg2 where g extends to the boundary and has normal form\ng = dr 2 + hr .\nThen, an easy application of (2.9) gives the expression for I*D acting on scalar densities\nof weight w and we find\n\u0001\n\u0001\ng\nI*D = \u2212 r\u2202r \u2212 2s + n + 1 \u2202r \u2212 Hr r\u2202r + n \u2212 s \u2212 r\u2206hr .\n\nwith Hr = 12 hij \u2202r hij and hij is the metric defined by hr at fixed r. This is the operator\nemployed in the proof of Proposition 4.2 of [40].\n6. The Fefferman\u2013Graham ambient metric and almost Einstein spaces\nRecall from Section 2.1 that a conformal structure (of any signature (p, q)) is equivalent\nto the ray bundle \u03c0 : G \u2192 M d of conformally related metrics. Let us use \u03c1 to denote\nthe R+ action on G given by \u03c1(t)(x, gx ) = (x, t2 gx ). An ambient manifold is a smooth\n(d + 2)-manifold M\u0303 endowed with a free R+ \u2013action \u03c1 and an R+ \u2013equivariant embedding\ni : G \u2192 M\u0303 . We write X \u2208 \u0393(T M\u0303 ) for the fundamental field generating the R+ \u2013\naction. That is, for f \u2208 C \u221e (M\u0303 ) and u \u2208 M\u0303 , we have Xf (u) = (d/ds)f (\u03c1(es )u)|s=0 .\nFor an ambient manifold M\u0303 , an ambient metric is a pseudo\u2013Riemannian metric h of\nsignature (p + 1, q + 1) on M\u0303 satisfying the conditions: (i) LX h = 2h, where LX\ndenotes the Lie derivative by X; (ii) for u = (x, gx ) \u2208 G and \u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 Tu G, we have\nh(i\u2217 \u03be, i\u2217 \u03b7) = gx (\u03c0\u2217 \u03be, \u03c0\u2217 \u03b7). In [20] (and see [22]) Fefferman and Graham considered\nformally the Gursat problem of obtaining Ric(h) = 0. They proved that for the case of\nd = 2 and d \u2265 3 odd this may be achieved to all orders, while for d \u2265 4 even, the problem\nis obstructed at finite order by a natural 2-tensor conformal invariant (this is the Bach\ntensor if d = 4, and is called the Fefferman\u2013Graham obstruction tensor in higher even\ndimensions); for d even one may obtain Ric(h) = 0 up to the addition of terms vanishing\nto order d/2\u22121. (See [22] for the statements concerning uniqueness. For extracting results\nvia tractors we do not need this, as discussed in e.g. [10, 31].) We shall henceforth call\nany (approximately or otherwise) Ricci-flat metric on M\u0303 a Fefferman\u2013Graham metric. In\nthe subsequent discussion of ambient metrics all results can be assumed to hold formally\nto all orders unless stated otherwise.\nIn the following discussion we typically use bold symbols or tilded symbols for the\nobjects on M\u0303 . For example \u2207 denotes the Levi-Civita connection on M\u0303 . Familiarity\nwith the treatment of the Fefferman\u2013Graham metric, as in e.g. [10, 32] or [6], will be\nassumed. In particular, we shall use that suitably homogeneous tensor fields of M\u0303 |G\ncorrespond to tractor fields. This correspondence is compatible with the Levi-Civita\nconnection in that each weight zero tractor field F on M corresponds to (the restriction\nto G of) a homogenous tensor field F (of the same tensor rank) on M\u0303 with the property\nthat it is parallel in the vertical direction, that is \u2207X F = X A \u2207A F = 0 along G. The\nmetric h and its Levi-Civita connection \u2207 on M\u0303 determine a metric and connection on\nthe tractor bundles, and by [10, Theorem 2.5] this agrees with the normal tractor metric\nand connection. We use abstract indices in an obvious way on M\u0303 and these are lowered\nand raised using hAB and its inverse hAB .\nWe shall say F is homogeneous of weight w0 \u2208 C if \u2207X F = w0 F , and this corresponds\nto a tractor field F of weight w0 . We shall always take such fields to be extended off G\nsmoothly and so that \u2207X F = w0 F on M\u0303 . Along G then \u2207X , as applied to tensor fields\n\n\fCalculus on conformally compact manifolds\n\n31\n\nof well defined weight, gives an ambient realisation of the weight operator. Note also that\nif \u03c4 \u2208 \u0393E+ [w0 ] and \u03c4 is the corresponding ambient function, positive and homogeneous\nof weight w0 , then\n[\u2207X , log \u03c4 ] = w0 ,\ncompatible with our extension of the weight operator\n\u0001 to log densities.\nIn this picture the operator DA = d + 2 w0 \u2212 2 \u2207A \u2212 XA \u2206 on tensors homogeneous\nof weight w0 corresponds to the tractor-D operator as applied to tractors of weight w0 .\nThus we equivalently view this as a restriction of\nDA = \u2207A (d + 2\u2207X \u2212 2) + X A \u2206.\nThis acts tangentially along the submanifold G in M\u0303 , [6] and [32], and is compatible with\nour treatment of log-densities.\nGiven a (generalised) scale \u03c3 \u2208 \u0393E[1] on M , we shall write \u03c3\u0303 for the corresponding\nhomogeneous weight 1 function on G and its homogeneous extension to M\u0303 . Then with\n1\nI A := DA \u03c3\u0303\nd\na restriction of the differential operator\n(6.1)\n\nI*D := \u2207I (d + 2\u2207X \u2212 2) \u2212 \u03c3\u0303\u2206\n\n(on M\u0303 ) lifts the operator I*D on M , enabling calculations on M\u0303 .

The almost Einstein setting and Theorem 4.5. Here we consider the case\n(M d , c, \u03c3) almost Einstein, so IA = 1d DA \u03c3 is parallel. Let us first consider the case of d\nodd. The homogeneous degree 1 function \u03c3\u0303 on G, corresponding to \u03c3, can be extended\noff G smoothly to a homogeneous degree 1 function on M\u0303 that also satisfies \u2206\u03c3\u0303 = 0\nformally to all orders [36]. In this case, which we henceforth assume, I A is parallel\n\n\f32\n\nGover & Waldron\n\non M\u0303 [28]. (Reference [28] treats the case of Riemannian signature (M, c), and I 2 = 1,\nthere is little difference in moving to general signature and constant I 2 6= 0.)\nLet us assume then that the ambient manifold M\u0303 is equipped with a parallel vector\nI A = d1 DA \u03c3\u0303, of non-zero length, and the zero locus \u03a3\u0303 = Z(\u03c3\u0303) of \u03c3\u0303 = XA I A is nonempty. Note that \u2207\u03c3\u0303 is nowhere vanishing on \u03a3\u0303, which is thus necessarily a hypersurface.\nBy homogeneity, \u03a3\u0303 \u2229 G = \u03c0 \u22121 (\u03a3), where \u03a3 = Z(\u03c3).\nLet f \u03030 be a section of a tensor bundle on M\u0303 which is homogeneous of weight k\u2212n\n2 ,\nwhere n = d \u2212 1. We wish to consider (I*D)k f \u03030 along \u03a3\u0303. By the lift of the calculations\nfrom Section 4.1 we conclude that (I*D)k acts tangentially on f \u03030 , along \u03a3\u0303 \u2229 G. In fact\nit is easily verified that \u03c3\u0303, \u2212 I12 I*D and (d + 2\u2207X ) generate an sl(2) (compatible in the\nobvious way with g) and that (I*D)k acts tangentially on f \u03030 , along \u03a3\u0303. Thus to simplify\ncalculations we extend smoothly f \u03030 smoothly off \u03a3\u0303 by the equation I A \u2207A f \u03030 = 0. It is\neasily verified that (for any weight w0 ) this is consistent with the homogeneity assumption\n\u2207X f \u03030 = w0 f \u03030 .\nFor f \u03030 of any weight w0 , and satisfying I A \u2207A f \u03030 = 0 we have\n(I*D)k f \u03030 = \u2212(I*D)k\u22121 (\u03c3\u0303\u2206f \u03030 )\n \u0303 0 \u2212 I 2 (k \u2212 1)(d + 2w0 \u2212 k \u2212 2)(I*D)k\u22122 \u2206f \u03030 .\n= \u2212\u03c3\u0303(I*D)k\u22121 \u2206f\nOn the other hand using that I is parallel, we have that [I A \u2207A , \u2206] = 0, on tensor fields\nover M\u0303 .

The statement there concerning the leading order term of\nthe operator is also an easy consequence of the calculation above.\nNow for simplicity let us assume I 2 = 1. As established in [28, Theorem 6.3] the\ninduced Ricci metric h\u03a3\u0303 on \u03a3\u0303 is Ricci flat and (\u03a3\u0303, h\u03a3\u0303 ) gives a Fefferman\u2013Graham ambient\nmetric to all orders for the conformal structure (\u03a3, c\u03a3 ).\n \u0303\nNow consider the case where f0 is a density in E[ k\u2212n\n2 ] and f0 the corresponding hok\n\nmogeneous function on M\u0303 . On the Fefferman\u2013Graham space (\u03a3\u0303, h\u03a3\u0303 ) the powers \u2206\u03a3\u03032 ,\nfor even k, are tangential along G \u2229 \u03a3\u0303; for k \u2264 n these give the GJMS operators, by\ndefinition [36]. It follows at once that for f0 a density in E[ k\u2212n\n2 ] we have\n(\u2212\n\n\u0002\n\u00032\n1\nk\nk\n \u0303\n2 I*D) f0 = (\u22121) (k \u2212 1)!! Pk f0 ,\nI\n\nk \u2208 {2, 4, * * * , n/2}\n\nwhere Pk is the order k GJMS operator. This establishes Theorem 4.5 for d \u2265 3 odd.\nFor d \u2265 4 even all the above goes through, except that the usual construction as\nin [20], for the Fefferman\u2013Graham ambient metric is obstructed at finite order, as stated\nearlier. So also is the \"harmonic\" extension of \u03c3\u0303 off G, we may obtain for example that\n0 = \u2206\u03c3\u0303 = \u22062 \u03c3\u0303 = * * * = \u2206d/2 \u03c3\u0303 along G, but at the next order the problem is potentially\nobstructed (and \u2206d/2+1 depends on c beyond the order of the obstruction). However by\na straightforward counting of derivatives it is verified that we recover the usual GJMS\noperators to at least the order claimed in Theorem 4.5.\nReferences\n[1] O. Aharony, S.S.
