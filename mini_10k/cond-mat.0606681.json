Z. Sun and X. R. Wang\nPhysics Department, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong SAR, China\n(Dated: October 26, 2018)\nThe theoretical limit of the minimal magnetization switching field and the optimal field pulse\ndesign for uniaxial Stoner particles are investigated. Two results are obtained. One is the existence\nof a theoretical limit of the smallest magnetic field out of all possible designs. It is shown that\nthe limit is proportional to the damping constant in the weak damping regime and approaches\nthe Stoner-Wohlfarth (SW) limit at large damping. For a realistic damping constant, this limit is\nmore than ten times smaller than that of so-called precessional magnetization reversal under a noncollinear static field. The other is on the optimal field pulse design: If the magnitude of a magnetic\nfield does not change, but its direction can vary during a reversal process, there is an optimal design\nthat gives the shortest switching time. The switching time depends on the field magnitude, damping\nconstant, and magnetic anisotropy. However, the optimal pulse shape depends only on the damping\nconstant.\nPACS numbers: 75.60.Jk, 75.75.+a, 85.70.Ay\n\nFabrication[1, 2] and manipulation[3] of magnetic\nsingle-domain nano-particles (also called the Stoner particles) are of great current interests in nano-technology\nand nano-sciences because of their importance in spintronics. Magnetization reversal, which is about how to\nswitch a magnetization from one state to another, is an\nelementary operation. One important issue is how to\nswitch a magnetization fast by using a small switching\nfield. The switching field can be a laser light[4], or a spinpolarized electric current[5, 6], or a magnetic field[7, 8].\nMany reversal schemes[9, 10] have been proposed and\nexamined. However, the issue of theoretical limits of the\nsmallest switching field and the shortest switching time\nunder all possible schemes are not known yet. Here we\nreport two theorems on the magnetic-field induced magnetization reversal for uniaxial Stoner particles. One is\nabout the theoretical limit of the smallest possible switching field. The other is about the optimal field pulse for\nthe shortest switching time when the field magnitude is\ngiven.\n~ = mM\nMagnetization M\n~\nof a Stoner particle can be\nconveniently described by a polar angle \u03b8 and an azimuthal angle \u03c6, shown in Fig. 1a, because its magnitude\nM does not change with time. The dynamics of magnetization unit direction m\n~ is governed by the dimensionless\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation[3, 8],\ndm\n~\n= \u2212m\n~ \u00d7 ~ht \u2212 \u03b1m\n~ \u00d7 (m\n~ \u00d7 ~ht ),\n(1)\ndt\nwhere \u03b1 is a phenomenological damping constant whose\ntypical value ranges from 0.01 to 0.22 for Co films[11].\nThe total field ~ht = ~h + ~hi comes from an applied field\n~h and an internal field ~hi = \u2212\u2207m\n~ due to the mag~ w(m)\nnetic anisotropic energy density w(m).\n~ Different particle\nis characterized by different w(m).\n~ In our analysis, we assume it uniaxial with the easy axis along the z-direction,\n\u03b8)\nw = w(cos \u03b8) and ~hi = \u2212 \u2202w(cos\n\u2202(cos \u03b8) \u1e91 \u2261 f (cos \u03b8)\u1e91.\n(1 + \u03b12 )\n\nAccording to Eq. (1), each field generates two motions,\na precession motion around the field and a damping motion toward the field as shown in Fig. 1a. In terms of\n\u03b8 \u2212 \u03c6, Eq. (1) can be rewritten as[3],\n(1 + \u03b12 )\u03b8\u0307 = h\u03c6 + \u03b1h\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b1f (cos \u03b8) sin \u03b8,\n\n(1 + \u03b12 ) sin \u03b8\u03c6\u0307 = \u03b1h\u03c6 \u2212 h\u03b8 + f (cos \u03b8) sin \u03b8.\n\n(2)\n\nHere h\u03b8 and h\u03c6 are the field components along \u00ea\u03b8 \u2212 and\n\u00ea\u03c6 \u2212 directions of m,\n~ respectively.\nThe switching problem is as follows: In the absence\nof an external field, the particle has two stable states,\nm\n~ 0 (point A) and \u2212m\n~ 0 (point B) along its easy axis as\nshown in Fig. 1b. Initially, the magnetization is m\n~ 0 , and\nthe goal is to reverse it to \u2212m\n~ 0 by applying an external\nfield. There are infinite number of paths that connect\nthe initial and the target state. L1 and L2 in Fig. 1b\nare two examples. Each of these paths can be used as\na magnetization reversal route (path). For a given path,\nthere are infinite number of ways of designing magnetic\nfield pulses such that the magnetization will move along\nthe path. Different design leads to different switching\ntime. Let ~hL,s (t) be the magnetic field pulse of design s\nalong magnetization reversal route L. To proceed, a few\nquantities must first be introduced.\nDefinition of switching field H L,s : The switching field\nL,s\nH\nof design s along route L is defined to be the largest\nmagnitude of ~hL,s (t) for all t, H L,s = max{|~hL,s (t)|; \u2200t}.\nDefinition of minimal switching field H L on reversal\nroute L: The minimal switching field along route L is\ndefined to be the smallest value of H L,s for all possible\ndesigns s that will force the magnetization to move along\nL, i.e. H L = min{H L,s; \u2200s}.\nDefinition of theoretical limit of minimal switching field\nHc : The switching field limit Hc is defined as the smallest value of H L out of all possible routes, i.e. Hc =\nmin{H L ; \u2200L}.\n\n\f2\n\nz\n\n(a)\n\nh\n\nh\n\n\u2212m\n\u03b8\n\u03c6\n\nx\n\nz A\n\n\u2212m (m h )\n\nm\n\nL1\n\ny\n\nL2\n\n(b) x\n\ny\n\nB\n\nFIG. 1: a, Two motions of magnetization m\n~ under field ~h:\n\u2212m\n~ \u00d7 ~h and \u2212m\n~ \u00d7 (m\n~ \u00d7 ~h) describe the precession and dissipation motions, respectively. b, Points A and B represent the\ninitial and the target states, respectively. The solid curve L1\nand dashed curve L2 illustrate two possible reversal routes.\n\nIf the applied field is restricted to be static, H L forms\nthe so-called modified Stoner-Wohlfarth (SW) astroid[7],\nand Hc is below, but close to, the SW field when the\napplied field is about 135\u25e6 from the easy-axis[7]. The\nfirst issue is about the existence of Hc .\nTheorem 1: For a given uniaxial magnetic anisotropy\n\u03b8)\nspecified by f (cos \u03b8) = \u2212 \u2202w(cos\n\u2202(cos \u03b8) , the theoretical limit\n\u03b1\nof the minimal switching field is given by Hc = \u221a1+\u03b1\nQ,\n2\nwhere Q = max{f (cos \u03b8) sin \u03b8}, \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0].\nProof: To find the lowest possible switching field, it\nshould be noticed that field along the radius direction hr\nof an external field does not appear in Eq. (2). Thus one\ncan lower the switching field by always putting\nq hr = 0,\nand the magnitude of the external field is h = h2\u03b8 + h2\u03c6 .\nAccording to Eq. (2), \u03b8\u0307 and \u03c6\u0307 are fully determined by h\u03b8\nand h\u03c6 and vice versa. It can be shown that h2 can be\nexpressed in terms of \u03b8, \u03c6, \u03b8\u0307, and \u03c6\u0307\ng \u2261 h2 =(1 + \u03b12 )\u03b8\u03072 + 2\u03b1f (cos \u03b8) sin \u03b8\u03b8\u0307\n\n+ (\u03b1 sin \u03b8\u03c6\u0307)2 + sin2 \u03b8[\u03c6\u0307 \u2212 f (cos \u03b8)]2 .\n\n(3)\n\nHere g(\u03b8\u0307, \u03b8, \u03c6\u0307) does not depend explicitly on \u03c6 for a uniaxial model.\nIn order to find the minimum of g, it can be shown\nthat \u03c6 must obey the following equation:\n\u03c6\u0307 = f (cos \u03b8)/(1 + \u03b12 ),\n2\n\n(4)\n\nwhich is from \u2202\u2202g\u03c6\u0307 |(\u03b8\u0307,\u03b8) = 0 and \u2202\u2202\u03c6\u0307g2 |(\u03b8\u0307,\u03b8) > 0.\nEq. (4) is a necessary condition for the smallest minimal switching field. This can be understood as follows.\nAssume Hc is the minimal switching field along reversal\npath L described by \u03b8(t) = \u03b81 (t) and \u03c6(t) = \u03c61 (t) (i.e.\nHc is the maximum magnitude of the external field that\ngenerates the motion of \u03b81 (t) and \u03c61 (t)). If \u03c61 (t) does not\nsatisfy Eq. (4), then one can construct another reversal\npath L\u2217 specified by \u03b8(t) = \u03b81 (t) and \u03c6(t) = \u03c62 (t), where\n\u03c62 (t) satisfies Eq. (4). Because \u03b8(t) and \u03b8\u0307 are exactly\n\nthe same on both paths L and L\u2217 at an arbitrary time\nt, the values of g(t) shall be smaller on L\u2217 than those on\nL at any t. Thus, the maximum g \u2217 = (Hc\u2217 )2 of g on L\u2217\nwill be also smaller than that (Hc2 ) on L, i.e. Hc\u2217 < Hc .\nBut this is in contradiction with the assumption that Hc\nis the theoretical limit of the minimal switching field.\nHence, \u03c6(t) must obey Eq. (4) on the optimal path that\ngenerates the smallest switching field, Hc .\nSubstituting Eq. (4) into Eq. (3), we have\nh2 = [\n\np\n\n1 + \u03b12 \u03b8\u0307 + \u03b1f (cos \u03b8) sin \u03b8/\n\np\n1 + \u03b12 ]2 .\n\n(5)\n\nIn order to make h minimum, one notices that Eq. (5)\ndoes not contain \u03c6. Thus optimal reversal path should\nsatisfy \u03b8\u0307 \u2265 0 during its reversal from \u03b8 = 0 to \u03b8 =\n\u03c0. Furthermore, the second term in Eq. (5) is antisymmetric about \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 plane (positive in the upper\nhemisphere and negative in the lower hemisphere). Thus,\nthe largest value of h on the optimal reversal path oc\u03b1Q\n, where\ncurs in the upper hemisphere. It equals \u221a1+\u03b1\n2\nQ \u2261 max{f (cos \u03b8) sin \u03b8}. -QED\nTo have a better picture about what this theoretical\nlimit Hc is, we consider a well-studied uniaxial model,\nw(m)\n~ = \u2212km2z /2, or f = k cos \u03b8. It is easy to show that\nthe largest h is at \u03b8 = \u03c0/4 so that Q = k/2, and\nk\n\u03b1\n.\nHc = \u221a\n2\n1+\u03b1 2\n\n(6)\n\nAt small damping, Hc is proportional to the damping\nconstant. The result in the limit of \u03b1 \u2192 0 coincides\nwith the switching field in reference 9 where the timedependent field always follows the motion of magnetization. At the large damping, Hc approaches the SW\nfield[8] when a non-collinear static switching field is 135\u25e6\nfrom the easy-axis. The solid curve in Fig. 2 is Hc versus \u03b1. For comparison, the minimal switching fields from\nother reversal schemes are also plotted. The dotted line\nis the minimal switching field when the applied field is always parallel to the motion of the magnetization[9]. The\ncurve in square symbols is the minimal switching field\nwhen a circularly polarized microwave at optimal frequencies is applied[9]. The dashed line is minimal switching field under a non-collinear static field of 135\u25e6 to the\neasy-axis. It saturates to the SW field beyond \u03b1c [7, 8].\nAlthough the theoretical limit of the switching field is\nacademically important because it provides a low bound\nto the switching field so that one can use the theorem to\nevaluate the quality of one particular strategy, a design\nusing a field at the theoretical limit would not be interesting from a practical point of view because the switching\ntime would be infinite long. Thus, it is more important\nto design a reversal path and a field pulse such that the\nreversal time is the shortest when the field magnitude\nH (H > Hc ) is given.

The optimal reversal path\n(connects \u03b8 = 0 and \u03b8 = \u03c0) that gives the shortest switching time is the magnetization trajectory generated by the\nfollowing field pulse ~h(t),\nhr (t) = 0,\np\nh\u03b8 (t) = \u03b1H/ 1 + \u03b12 ,\np\nh\u03c6 (t) = H/ 1 + \u03b12 = h\u03b8 /\u03b1.\n\n(7)\n\nR \u03c0Proof: The reversal time from A to B (Fig.1b) is T \u2261\nd\u03b8/\u03b8\u0307. According to Eq. (2), one needs (h\u03c6 + \u03b1h\u03b8 ) to\n0\nbe as large as possible in order to make \u03b8\u0307 maximal at\nan arbitrary \u03b8. Since H 2 = h2r + h2\u03b8 + h2\u03c6 , one has the\nfollowing identity:\n(1+\u03b12 )H 2 = (1+\u03b12 )h2r +(h\u03c6 +\u03b1h\u03b8 )2 +(h\u03b8 \u2212\u03b1h\u03c6 )2 . (8)\n\u221a\nThus, (h\u03c6 + \u03b1h\u03b8 ) reaches the maximum of 1 + \u03b12 H\nwhen hr = 0 and h\u03b8 = \u03b1h\u03c6 , which lead to Eq. (7), are\nsatisfied. -QED\nUnder the optimal design of (7), \u03c6(t) and \u03b8(t) satisfy,\nrespectively, Eq. (4) and\np\n\u03b8\u0307 = H/ 1 + \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b1f (cos \u03b8) sin \u03b8/(1 + \u03b12 ).\n(9)\nFor uniaxial magnetic anisotropy w(m)\n~ = \u2212km2z /2, it\nis straight forward to integrate Eq. (9), and to find the\nreversal time T from A to B (Fig.1b),\nT =\n\n(\u03b12 + 1)\u03c0\n2\np\n.\nk 4(\u03b12 + 1)H 2 /k 2 \u2212 \u03b12\n\n(10)\n\nIn the weak damping limit \u03b1 \u2192 0, T \u2248 \u03c0/H while in the\nlarge damping limit \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e, T \u2248 \u221a 2\u03b1\u03c0 2 \u2192 \u221e. For\n\u221a\n\n2\n\nH \u2212k /4\n\nthe large field H \u2192 \u221e, T \u2248 \u03b1H+1\u03c0 , inversely proportional to the field strength. Thus, it is better to make \u03b1\nas small as possible. Then the critical field is low, and\nthe speed is fast (T \u223c \u03c0/H). Fig. 3 shows the field dependence of the switching time for \u03b1 = 0.1, where T and\nH are in the units of 2/k and k/2, respectively.\n\nFIG. 3: The field dependence of T under the optimal field\npulse Eq. (7) for \u03b1 = 0.1. The field is in the unit of k/2 and\nthe unit for time is 2/k.\n\nHow much could the so-called ballistic (precessional)\nreversal strategy[7, 12] be improved? To answer the question, let us compare the switching field and time in the\nballistic reversal with those of theoretical limits for uniaxial magnetic anisotropy w(m)\n~ = \u2212km2z /2 and \u03b1 = 0.1.\nAccording to reference 8, the smallest switching field (in\nunit of k/2) for the ballistic connection between A and B\n(Fig.1b) is H = 1.02 applied in 97.7\u25e6 to the easy z-axis,\nand the corresponding ballistic reversal time (in unit of\n2/k) is T = 5.87. On the other hand, the theoretical limit\nfor the minimal switching field is Hc \u2248 0.1 from Eq. (6),\nabout one tenth of the minimal switching field in the\nballistic reversal[8]. For realistic value of \u03b1 of order of\n0.01, the difference between experimentally achieved low\nswitching field and the theoretical limit is of the order of\nhundred times. Thus there is a very large room for an improvement. It is also possible to switch a magnetization\nfaster than that of the conventional ballistic reversal by\nusing a smaller field. For example, To achieve a reversal\ntime of T = 5.87 along the optimal route, the field magnitude can be as lower as H = 0.547 (instead of H = 1.02)\naccording to Fig. 3.\nThe field pulse given in Eq. (7) requires a constant adjustment of field-direction during the magnetization reversal. To have a better ideal about the type of fields\nrequired, we plot in Fig. 4a the time dependence of x-,\ny- and z-component of the field while its magnitude is\nkept at H = 0.547. The time dependence of \u03b8 and \u03c6 is\nalso plotted in Fig. 4b-c.\nAlthough the Stoner-Wohlfarth problem of magnetization reversal for a uniaxial model is of great relevance to\nthe magnetic nano-particles, it is interesting to generalize\nthe results to the non-uniaxial cases. So far, our results\nis on the magnetic field induced magnetization reversal,\nit will be extremely important to generalize the results to\nthe spin-torque induced magnetization reversal. It should\nalso be pointed out that it is an experimental challenge\nto create a time-dependent field pulse given by Eq. (7)\nin order to implement the optimal design reported here.\nIn conclusion, the theoretical limit of the magnetization switching field for uniaxial Stoner particles is ob-\n\n\f4\nh\n\n(a)\n\nh\nh\n\n0.0\n\nz\n\nx\n\ny\n\nh\n\nx,y,z\n\n(k/2)\n\n0.5\n\n[4]\n\n-0.5\n0\n\nt (2/k)\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6\n\n[5]\n\n(t)\n\n4\n2\n\n(t)\n\n[6]\n\n2\n\n1\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nt (2/k)\n\n6\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nt (2/k)\n\nFIG. 4: Time dependence of different field components, \u03b8 and\n\u03c6 for uniaxial magnetic anisotropy w(m)\n~ = \u2212km2z /2 with\n\u03b1 = 0.1 and H = 0.547 when the reversal path is optimal.\nThe reversal time is T = 5.87. a, X-, y- and z-components of\nmagnetic field. b, \u03b8(t). c, \u03c6(t).\n\ntained.
