INTRODUCTION\n\nMass-loss from massive stars in the red supergiant\nphase is fundamental to the chemical enrichment of the\ninterstellar medium (Gehrz 1989). Red supergiants, with\ninitial masses of 10\u221250M\u2299, are known to lose mass at\nrates of up to 10\u22124 M\u2299 /yr (Humphreys 1986). Mass-loss\nrates are commonly estimated indirectly, using observations of infrared continuum excesses (e.g., Stencel et al.\n1989) or measurements of CO rotational line intensities (e.g., de Beck et al. 2010). Outflowing material is\nalso directly surveyed through observations of systematic spectral line displacements (Adams & MacCormack\n1935) and interferometric studies over multiple epochs\n(Bester et al. 1996). The physical processes involved in\nred supergiant mass-loss are however not well understood. While mass-loss from less massive stars, such\nas AGB stars, is understood in terms of significant radial pulsations and winds driven by radiation pressure\non dust grains, such mechanisms are not applicable to\nred supergiants (Josselin & Plez 2007), except those in\na superwind phase (Yoon & Cantiello 2010). Rotation\nin stars that are spun-up as they condense from protostellar clouds could play a role in driving mass-loss\n(Heger & Langer 1998), as could Alfv\u00e8n and acoustic\nwaves (e.g., Hartmann & MacGregor 1980). In the case\nof Betelgeuse (\u03b1 Orionis, spectral type M2Iab), the elevation of cool photospheric gas (Lim et al. 1998) and\ngas at chromospheric temperatures (Gilliland & Dupree\n1996) has been attributed to large-scale surface convective activity (Schwarzschild 1975; Antia et al. 1984).\nBetelgeuse is perhaps the archetypal red supergiant.\nIts large angular diameter (0.047\u2032\u2032 , Michelson & Pease\n1921) and high apparent magnitude (MK = \u22124.38) make\nit an excellent subject for high spatial resolution studies. The continuum angular diameter of Betelgeuse has\nbeen measured using interferometric techniques at radio\n(Lim et al. 1998), mid-IR (8\u221212 \u03bcm, Weiner et al. 2003a;\n1 Present address: School of Physics, University of Melbourne,\nParkville, VIC 3010, Australia\n\nPerrin et al. 2007), near-IR (e.g., Perrin et al. 2004;\nHaubois et al. 2009), optical (e.g., Michelson & Pease\n1921; Bonneau & Labeyrie 1973; Buscher et al. 1990)\nand ultraviolet (Gilliland & Dupree 1996) wavelengths,\nand significant variation of the diameter with wavelength is observed. The apparent mid-IR diameter is\nalso observed to vary significantly on timescales of years\n(Townes et al. 2009). Numerous interferometric campaigns, from optical to mid-IR wavelengths, have further\nrevealed up to three hotspots on the stellar surface (e.g.,\nBuscher et al. 1990; Young et al. 2000; Haubois et al.\n2009; Tatebe et al. 2007). These spots range in intensity from a few to a few tens of percent of the intensity\nof the stellar disk. The detection of these spots is generally interpreted as direct evidence for the presence of\na few giant convection cells on the stellar surface (e.g.,\nChiavassa et al. 2010).\nA profusion of circumstellar components have been\nidentified surrounding Betelgeuse. Furthest from the\nstar, an analysis of mid-IR spectra and interferometric\ndata by Danchi et al. (1994) showed the presence of two\nthin shells of dust at approximately 40 and 80 stellar\nradii (R\u2217 ), with temperatures of \u223c400 K and \u223c200 K respectively. Later work by Bester et al. (1996) revealed a\nthird, more compact dust shell at 4R\u2217 that was not apparent in previous data. The dust condensation zone and\nacceleration mechanism are not identified. Radio continuum observations by Lim et al. (1998) at wavelengths between 0.7 cm and 6 cm, probing spatial scales of 2 \u2212 7R\u2217,\nrevealed the presence of neutral gas at temperatures between 3500 K and 1300 K. These temperatures are consistent with the temperature profile of the Betelgeuse\natmosphere in these regions, as derived from mean temperature and density models (Harper et al. 2001, 2009).\nAt 2R\u2217 , the gas distribution is asymmetric, indicating\nan anisotropic mechanism for elevating the gas above\nthe photosphere. Ultraviolet (Gilliland & Dupree 1996)\nand H\u03b1 (Hebden et al. 1987) imaging observations have\nshown that this cool gas co-exists with asymmetricallydistributed hot chromospheric material. Observations of\n\n\f2\n\nRavi et al.\n\n[Fe II] lines by Harper et al. (2009) that correspond to\nthe dominant cool atmospheric component showed, surprisingly, that this material was at rest with respect to\nthe star. The circumstellar envelope as viewed across\nthe JHK wavelength bands was imaged using a 'luckyimaging' approach combined with adaptive optics by\nKervella et al. (2009), and was found to include a plume\nextending to 6R\u2217 .\nCloser to the star, strong evidence exists for the\npresence of a cool molecular layer or shell directly\nabove the photosphere within 1.5R\u2217 (e.g. Ohnaka 2004;\nPerrin et al. 2007). This layer is optically thick at mid-IR\nwavelengths but is optically thin in the near-IR. Spectral\nsignatures of water from Betelgeuse and the red supergiant \u03bc Cephei, found using data from the Infrared Space\nObservatory (ISO), were interpreted by Tsuji (2000a,b)\nas originating from a 1500 K layer surrounding these\nstars. Modeling of near- and mid-IR interferometric data\nby Perrin et al. (2004) confirmed the presence of such a\nlayer, with a mid-IR optical depth of \u223c2 and a temperature of \u223c2000 K. Further work by Tsuji (2006) combining both interferometric and spectroscopic data placed\nthe layer surrounding Betelgeuse at beyond 1.3R\u2217 , with\na temperature of 2250 K. The layer was shown not to be\nsolely composed of water by Verhoelst et al. (2006), who\nsuggested the presence of amorphous alumina (Al2 O3 ) to\nexplain the high mid-IR opacity. The spectrum of water lines from Betelgeuse is indeed more complex than\nrevealed by the ISO data; signatures of water at photospheric temperatures were detected by Jennings & Sada\n(1998) and Ryde et al. (2006). Most recently, wideband, spectrally dispersed mid-IR interferometric observations by Perrin et al. (2007) were fitted by a layer\ncontaining SiO, amorphous alumina and water. High\nresolution measurements of the CO overtone band near\n2.3 \u03bcm (Ohnaka et al. 2009) and one-dimensional imaging (Ohnaka et al. 2011) were modeled with a large patch\nof gas near 1.45R\u2217 with motions of 10\u221215 km s\u22121 with respect to the star. This emerging model of a photosphere\nand overlying layer for a selection of red supergiant stars\nallows a better understanding of dust formation and red\nsupergiant wind acceleration (e.g. Verhoelst et al. 2009),\nleading towards a convergent picture of red supergiant\nmass loss.\nStudies of the extended Betelgeuse atmosphere form a\nbasis for a better understanding of the atmospheric dynamics of red supergiant stars. The existence of a cool\nlayer with high opacity at mid-IR wavelengths directly\nabove the photosphere is now established for Betelgeuse.\nThe size, temperature and composition of the layer have\nbeen investigated, assuming spherical symmetry. Little,\nhowever, is known about the spatial structure and timevariability of this layer. Consistent instrumentation and\nmodeling procedures have also not been applied over multiple observation epochs. In this paper, we present observations of the mid-IR continuum of Betelgeuse using the\nBerkeley Infrared Spatial Interferometer (ISI, Hale et al.\n2000). Interferometric data using three telescopes were\ngathered during each year between 2006 and 2010, with\nangular resolutions sufficient to model the stellar shape\nand potential large-scale features. We describe the observations and image-modeling processes in \u00a72, and perform fits to a photosphere-and-layer model for our ob-\n\nTABLE 1\nObserving log.\nYear\n\nDates (UT)\n\n11.15 \u03bcm flux density (103 Jy)\n\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n\n8, 9, 10 Nov; 7 Dec\n14, 15, 16 Nov\n22, 23, 24 Sep\n4, 5, 7, 9, 18, 20, 22 Nov\n5, 17, 18 Nov; 9, 13 Dec\n\n4.2\u00b10.2\n4.1\u00b10.3\n3.8\u00b10.5\n4.4\u00b10.1\n4.9\u00b10.3\n\nservations in \u00a73.

ISI OBSERVATIONS OF BETELGEUSE\n2.1. Observational methods\n\nThe ISI consists of three 1.65 m aperture telescopes\nwith a heterodyne detection system at each telescope.\nThe double-sideband detection systems are sensitive to\n9 \u2212 12 \u03bcm radiation within single sideband widths of\n\u223c2.7 GHz. The 13 CO2 laser local oscillators can operate\nat numerous wavelengths corresponding to vibrational\nmolecular transitions between wavelengths of 9 \u03bcm and\n12 \u03bcm. For the observations reported here, the local oscillators at each telescope were tuned to a wavelength of\n11.15 \u03bcm, chosen so as to exclude strong stellar and telluric spectral lines from the detection band (Weiner et al.\n2003b).\nThe van Cittert-Zernicke theorem equates the complex cross-correlation of the electric fields detected at two\nspatially-separated telescopes with the two-dimensional\nFourier transform of the source brightness distribution\nwithin the telescope fields of view. Instead of measuring\ncomplex cross-correlations, the ISI, like all optical/IR interferometers, measures the normalized cross-correlation\namplitude, known as the Michelson fringe visibility. The\nMichelson fringe visibility, V , is given by\nPf ringe\n,\nV = \u221a\nIA IB\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the fringe power, Pf ringe is the cross-correlation\namplitude between signals measured at two telescopes,\nA and B, and IA and IB are the source powers measured at telescopes A and B respectively. Visibility amplitudes are recorded for each ISI telescope baseline pair.\nThe visibility phase in the mid-IR for a given baseline\nis, however, strongly affected by randomly varying atmospheric pathlengths above each telescope, and cannot\nbe recovered from the data. The ISI instead measures\nthe closure phase, or the sum of the measured visibility\nphases for each baseline. The closure phase is independent of optical pathlength differences between pairs of\ntelescopes (Jennison 1958) and it provides information\nabout the point-inversion symmetry of the source. The\nspatial frequency sampled by the projection of a baseline\nof length b, perpendicular to the direction of a source,\nat a wavelength \u03bb, is proportional to b/\u03bb. By obtaining\nmeasurements at different source hour-angles, multiple\nspatial frequencies at different position angles are sampled.\nVisibility and closure phase data were recorded for\n\n\fThe mid-IR atmosphere of Betelgeuse\n\n3\n\nFig. 1.- Plots of the ISI measurements of Betelgeuse from 2006\u22122010. The left panels show visibilities, the center panels show closure\nphases, and the right panels show UV coverages, for each observing epoch (2006 to 2010 from top to bottom). The visibilities for each\nbaseline, denoted 1-2, 2-3 and 3-1, are depicted by diamonds, triangles and squares respectively (note that the spatial frequency ranges\nvary from year to year). The fitted model visibilities (Table 2) are shown as red, green and magenta lines for baselines 1-2, 2-3 and 3-1\nrespectively, and as magenta lines for the closure phases. The closure phases are plotted against the position angle, East of North, for\nbaseline 2-3. In the plots of the U V coverage, baseline 1-2 is represented by red diamonds, baseline 2-3 is represented by green triangles,\nand baseline 3-1 is represented by blue squares.\n\n\f4\n\nRavi et al.\n\nBetelgeuse over timespans of five weeks or less each year\nbetween 2006 and 2010 (see Table 1). During this time\nperiod, the three ISI telescopes were configured in an approximately equilateral triangle with baseline lengths between 34 m and 40 m. For Betelgeuse, this configuration\nallows spatial frequencies between 20 and 37 SFU (Spatial Frequency Unit; 1 SFU= 1 \u00d7 105 cycles radian\u22121 ) to\nbe sampled. For all observations, tip-tilt corrections were\napplied to center the source on K -band guider cameras\noperating at frame rates of 27 Hz. A standard observing sequence consisted of 4.5-minute dataset intervals of\nstaring at the source and position-switching between the\nsource and blank fields on either side of the source. The\nposition-switching measurements moved the telescopes\nbetween the source and the sky every 15 s. The source\npowers were measured using additional 140 Hz chopping\nbetween the source, or the sky, and cold loads with temperatures near that of the sky. A single visibility measurement consisted of either: (1) a fringe power measured\nduring a chopping/position-switching dataset, normalized using the source powers during that dataset; or (2)\na fringe power measured during a staring dataset, normalized by weighted averages of source powers measured\nduring the nearest chopping/position-switching datasets.\nClosure phases were calculated for each triplet of visibility measurements.\nVisibility magnitudes and closure phase zero-point offsets were calibrated using observations of Aldebaran (\u03b1\nTaurus) conducted on the same night. Aldebaran was\nassumed to have a diameter of 20 mas and zero closure\nphase. The visibility calibrations for the two kinds of\nvisibility measurements were different because of the different times spent on-source during chopping and staring\ndatasets. Data that were affected by systematic errors or\npoor atmospheric conditions were discarded. The total\nflux densities of Betelgeuse during each observing epoch\nwere also estimated using Aldebaran, assumed to have a\nflux density at 11.15 \u03bcm of 615 Jy (Monnier et al. 1998),\nas a calibrator. These total flux density values are given\nin Table 1, and represent the total power of Betelgeuse\nwithin the 5\u2032\u2032 \u00d75\u2032\u2032 fields of view of the ISI detectors.\n\n2.2. Image modeling\n\nImage models were fitted to the calibrated visibility and closure phase datasets for each epoch. The\ndata, analytic fits, and coverage of the U V spatial frequency plane, are shown in Figure 1. Effective modelindependent image reconstruction was not possible because of the sparsity of the U V coverage in all epochs.\nOur model images include a centered uniform disk (UD),\nand up to two point sources offset from the image centers. The uniform disks represent the apparent stellar\nsurface, and the point sources represent localised intensity fluctuations in this surface. Emission from the dust\nsurrounding the star at large angular scales, while contributing to the total detected intensity, was assumed\nnot to contribute to the visibility at the sampled spatial\nfrequencies. The intensity of each image component was\nfitted to a fraction of the total intensity. Other free parameters included the UD radius and the positions of the\npoint sources. The model complex visibility at a point\n\n(u, v) in the U V plane was given by\n\u221a\n2AJ1 (2\u03c0r u2 + v 2 )\n\u221a\nV (u, v) =\n+\n2\u03c0r u2 + v 2\nP1 e\u22122\u03c0i(ux1 +vy1 ) + P2 e\u22122\u03c0i(ux2 +vy2 ) ,\nwhere A is the fraction of the total intensity contributed\nby the UD, r is the uniform disk angular radius, J1 denotes a Bessel function of the first kind and of order\nunity, Pn represents the fractions of the total intensity\nof the point sources, and xn and yn represent angular\noffsets to the West and North for the point sources, with\nn = {1, 2}.\nWe used a weighted least-squares fitting technique for\neach epoch, with each baseline and the closure phase data\ngiven equal weights. The differing quality of data from\ndifferent epochs necessitated using models with different\nnumbers of free parameters to fit different epochs. Data\nfrom 2006 were fitted with a single point source in addition to a UD, data from 2007 and 2008 were only fitted\nwith UDs, and data from 2009 and 2010 were each fitted\nwith a UD and two point sources. An additional point\nsource was added to the fit for a given epoch only if the\nreduced \u03c72 values calculated for the full dataset, and for\nthe closure phase data alone, were both decreased upon\nthe addition of the point source. We also attempted to\nfit other image models. These included uniform ellipses,\nuniform ellipses with point sources, and UDs with offset\nuniform disks or offset two-dimensional Gaussian profiles\nin place of the point sources. None of these trials, however, converged to a satisfactory image, and the angular\nsizes of the fitted point sources are not determined. The\nfractions of the total intensity contributed by the point\nsources were not constrained to be positive, as our data\nare sensitive to both bright and dark features on the stellar disk.\nSimulations were conducted to assess possible degeneracies in fitted image model parameters given the sparsity of the U V coverage of our datasets, in order to ensure\nthat our data were not being over-fitted. No significant\ndegeneracies were found for any epoch. For example,\nthe 2006, 2009, and 2010 datasets constrain both the locations and brightnesses of the point sources. Closure\nphase measurements at multiple array position angles\nconstrain the position angles of the point sources, and\nboth the closure phase measurements and the visibility\nmeasurements constrain the angular offsets of the point\nsources from the image centers.\nThe results of the fits, as well as the reduced \u03c72 for each\nepoch, are given in Table 2. All the fits have reduced \u03c72\nvalues that are greater than unity. This implies that the\ndata contain minor features besides Gaussian noise that\nare not being fitted by the free parameters of the image\nmodels.\nISI data for Betelgeuse obtained during 2006 were also\nanalyzed by Tatebe et al. (2007). Despite our choice of\ndifferent observing dates, a different method of calibration and slightly different image fitting procedures, our\nresults match those of Tatebe et al. (2007) within the\nmargins of error. We however do not adopt Tatebe et\nal.'s results for the 2006 epoch in order to maintain the\nsame analysis procedure across all epochs.\n\n\fThe mid-IR atmosphere of Betelgeuse\n\n5\n\nTABLE 2\nUD and point source(s) models fitted to visibility and closure phase data.\nYear\n\nUD fraction\n\nUD radius\n\nPoint source fraction\n\nPt src x (mas)\n\nPt src y (mas)\n\nReduced \u03c72\n\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n\n0.51\u00b10.02\n0.54\u00b10.01\n0.48\u00b10.02\n0.557\u00b10.008\n\n24.5\u00b10.8\n24.8\u00b10.3\n24.7\u00b10.8\n26.4\u00b10.2\n\n0.61\u00b10.03\n\n26.4\u00b10.3\n\n-2.4\u00b10.1\n-25.0\u00b10.3\n18.3\u00b10.3\n-29.7\u00b10.3\n8.3\u00b10.3\n\n-23.7\u00b10.2\n10.5\u00b10.2\n-20.2\u00b10.2\n-9.3\u00b10.1\n-25.9\u00b10.1\n\n2.683\n2.053\n2.416\n4.565\n\n2010\n\n0.04\u00b10.01\n0.009\u00b10.001\n0.007\u00b10.001\n0.025\u00b10.009\n0.009\u00b10.004\n\n2.3. The changing angular diameter of Betelgeuse\n\nUsing ISI observations over the period 1993\u22122009,\nTownes et al. (2009) reported a systematic decrease of\n15% in the mid-IR continuum UD diameter of Betelgeuse. Here, we augment this finding with new measurements of the UD diameter of Betelgeuse. Figure\n2 shows the data plotted in Figure 1 of Townes et al.\n(2009), with the new results also included. Though the\npresent work re-analyzes some previous observations examined by Tatebe et al. (2007), the diameter measurements are obtained from different data sets and analyses\nfrom those reported by Townes et al. (2009). The measurement of the UD diameter of Betelgeuse at 11.15 \u03bcm\nby Perrin et al. (2007), obtained using the Very Large\nTelescope Interferometer in 2003, is also plotted. Recently, Ohnaka et al. (2011) showed that K-band diameter measurements, made over a similar time period, vary\nless than the mid-IR diameters plotted in Figure 2.\nWhile our results from 2006\u22122008 are consistent to\nwithin the margins of error with the trend towards\na smaller size (Townes et al. 2009), the UD diameters\nof Betelgeuse in 2009 and 2010 are significantly larger\nthan those during 2006\u22122008. Our analysis method for\nthe 2007 and 2008 datasets essentially matched that of\nTownes et al. (2009), in that only UDs were fitted to the\ndata. Our technique however differed somewhat in the\nmethods of calibration and fitting. We consider the variability in the apparent size of Betelgeuse in the mid-IR\nfurther in \u00a75.2.\n\n3.65\n\nPerrin et al. 2004; Boyajian et al. 2009) for two reasons:\nradiation at mid-IR wavelengths is strongly affected by\nthermal emission from circumstellar dust shells and bolometric correction factors at these wavelengths are unique\nto individual stars; and also because the correspondance\nbetween the 11.15 \u03bcm scattering surface and the photosphere of Betelgeuse is not certain.\nThe calculated effective temperatures for the observed\nstellar disk of Betelgeuse during each observing epoch are\nplotted in Figure 3. We do not account for attenuation\nby the interstellar medium, estimated as modifying the\nobserved flux density by a factor of 0.975 (Bester et al.\n1996). We also do not account for absorption of the stellar radiation by the dust that surrounds Betelgeuse at\nangular scales of 1\u2032\u2032 or larger, or for the emission from\nthis dust in the line of sight to the stellar face. This\nis because the dust shells are extremely optically thin\nat mid-IR wavelengths when viewed radially, with a total line-of-sight optical depth of approximately 0.0065\n(Danchi et al. 1994).\nOur measured effective temperatures of the midIR surface of Betelgeuse are consistently lower than\nthe value of 3641 K derived by Perrin et al. (2004) for\nthe photospheric component of a photosphere-and-layer\nmodel. Furthermore, significant variability is evident between the effective temperatures measured at different\nepochs. We therefore consider sources of mid-IR continuum opacity in the atmosphere of Betelgeuse in an attempt to elucidate the scattering surface probed by our\nobservations and the cause of the observed variability.\n\n3. A PHOTOSPHERE-AND-LAYER MODEL FOR\nBETELGEUSE\n\n3.1. The effective temperature\n\nEffective temperatures of stellar surfaces are among the\nfundamental parameters of stars (van Belle et al. 2010).\nThe ISI measurements of the flux density of Betelgeuse,\nand of the UD sizes and fractions of the total intensity,\nallow the effective temperature of the 11.15 \u03bcm apparent\nstellar surface to be determined at each observing epoch.\nWe use a Planck function for the power emitted by a\nblackbody to express the effective temperature, Tef f , as\nTef f =\n\nh\u03bd\n3\u03a9 ,\nkB ln(1 + 2h\u03bd\nc2 P )\n\n(2)\n\nwhere h is Planck's constant, \u03bd is the observing frequency, kB is Boltzmann's constant, \u03a9 is the solid angle subtended by the stellar disk, c is the vacuum speed\nof light, and P is the measured power from the stellar\ndisk in units of W m\u22122 Hz\u22121 . We do not use the widelyapplied technique of calculating effective temperatures\nusing estimates for the bolometric flux from the star (e.g.,\n\n3.2. The 11.15 \u03bcm scattering surface of Betelgeuse\nStellar atmospheres have opacities that vary with\nwavelength. Stars appear smaller at wavelengths where\nthe atmospheric opacity is smaller. The surface of a\nstar, when observed at a given wavelength, can be approximated as the location where the optical depth at\nthat wavelength, measured from the observer, is approximately unity. The photosphere of a star, however, is\nthe apparent stellar surface observed at a wavelength\nwhere the opacity matches the Rosseland mean opacity\n(Rosseland 1924). The Rosseland mean opacity, \u03baR , is\ngiven by\n\u0013 \u0012Z \u221e\n\u0012Z \u221e\n\u0013\u22121\n\u2202B(\u03bd)\n\u2202B(\u03bd) d\u03bd\n1\n=\nd\u03bd\n, (3)\n\u03baR\n\u2202T \u03ba(\u03bd)\n\u2202T\n0\n0\n\nwhere B(\u03bd) is the intensity of radiation from a point in\na stellar atmosphere, T is the temperature at that point,\nand \u03ba(\u03bd) is the opacity at a frequency \u03bd. Regions of a\nstellar spectrum with large radiation intensity but low\nopacity contribute most to determining the Rosseland\n\n\f6\n\nRavi et al.\n\nFig. 2.- The UD diameter of Betelgeuse at 11.15 \u03bcm measured using the ISI over the period 1993\u22122010.

(2007), obtained in 2003 with the VLTI, is plotted as a triangle.\nThe Modified Julian Day (MJD) corresponding to a given Julian Day (JD) is MJD=JD-2400000.5.\n\nFig. 3.- The effective temperature of the apparent 11.15 \u03bcm stellar disk of Betelgeuse for each ISI observing epoch in the present work.\n\n\fThe mid-IR atmosphere of Betelgeuse\nmean opacity. Weiner et al. (2003a) concluded that the\nmid-IR continuum opacity of a gas with solar atomic\nabundances under surface conditions present on red giant\nstars closely matches the Rosseland mean opacity of such\na gas.\nMolecular layers surrounding red giant stars have, however, been shown to significantly change the mid-IR opacity from that of a solar abundance atomic gas, while remaining relatively transparent in shorter wavelength IR\nbands (Weiner 2004; Perrin et al. 2004; Verhoelst et al.\n2006; Woodruff et al. 2009). The Perrin et al. (2004)\nmodel for Betelgeuse, combining K-band visibility data\nand a 11.15 \u03bcm ISI visibility curve (Weiner et al. 2000),\nincludes a shell with a K-band optical depth of 0.06 and\na 11.15 \u03bcm optical depth of 2.33. Perrin et al. (2007)\nshowed that this shell was composed of water, amorphous\nalumina dust and SiO gas, and that the 11.15 \u03bcm opacity\nwas dominated by alumina. The presence of alumina in\na layer surrounding Betelgeuse, within 1.5R\u2217 , was suggested by Verhoelst et al. (2006) as the only dust species\nthat could condense at the temperatures present in this\nregion. Alumina dust grains forming close to stars possibly play a role as nucleation sites for dust species that\ncondense at lower temperatures (e.g. Salpeter 1977).\nBremsstrahlung interactions between electrons and\nneutral hydrogen atoms also contribute to the mid-IR\ncontinuum opacity in red giant stars (Tatebe & Townes\n2006).\nThis emission mechanism was adduced by\nReid & Menten (1997) to explain the variation with\nwavelength of the apparent sizes of the radio photospheres of long-period variables, and ascribed to Betelgeuse by Lim et al. (1998). We discuss this opacity\nmodel further in \u00a73.4.\n3.3. Fits to a photosphere-and-layer model\n\nPrior work, the dramatic variations in apparent midIR diameters of Betelgeuse, and the low effective temperatures all provide clear motivation to model the new\nISI observational results in terms of a photosphere and\na molecular layer. Our method is similar to that of\nPerrin et al. (2007) in that we modeled a spherically symmetric layer surrounding an opaque stellar photosphere\nwith an assumed diameter of 0.04371\u2032\u2032 and an assumed\nsurface temperature of 3641 K (Perrin et al. 2004). Visibility and closure phase models for any observed point\nsources were subtracted from the data during each observation epoch in order to allow the model to be spherically symmetric. We did not attempt to fit an asymmetric layer because of the large number of free parameters\ninvolved. The free parameters of our model were: the\ntemperature, T , of the layer; the optical depth, \u03c4 , of the\nlayer along the line of sight to the center of the star; and,\nthe outer radius, R, of the layer.\nThe layer was assumed to have uniform temperature\nand opacity, and was also assumed to have an inner radius that corresponds to the photospheric radius. Radiation within the ISI band was assumed to arise only from\nblackbody emission by the layer.\nThe modeling procedure involved fitting visibilities derived from a model image, created using a trial set of free\nparameters, to the measured visibilities. The measured\nvisibilities for each epoch, and their errors, were scaled\nby the measurements of the measured power emitted by\nthe UD surface of Betelgeuse.

For each iteration of the fit, a model image\nwas generated and integrated along one dimension, and\na one-dimensional Fourier transform was performed in\norder to generate a set of visibilities. Each model visibility was compared to measured visibilities that were\nclosest to it (i.e., within \u00b10.5 SF U ) in spatial frequency.\nA Levenberg-Marquardt fitting algorithm was employed\nto calculate the free parameter set that minimized the\nglobal \u03c72 .\nThe results of the fit for each observing epoch are given\nin Table 3. Errors for each parameter were calculated using the resulting covariance matrix. In order to confirm\nthe validity of our analyses, we added the visibility and\nclosure phase models of the point sources, that were earlier subtracted from the visibility data from each epoch,\nto the best-fit model visibilities. \u03c72 values relating this\nsum to the original visibility data were calculated for each\nepoch, and were found to be comparable to the \u03c72 values\nof the fits to UDs and point sources shown in Table 2.\nThe changes with time of the fitted layer temperatures and outer radii are similar to the changes with\ntime in the effective stellar temperatures and the apparent UD radii respectively. All our fitted layer radii and\ntemperatures are roughly consistent with the 1.3\u22121.5R\u2217\n(0.057\u2032\u2032 to 0.065\u2032\u2032 diameter) and 1500\u22122000 K layers modeled by most authors (Tsuji 2000a; Ohnaka 2004; Tsuji\n2006; Verhoelst et al. 2006; Perrin et al. 2007). The values we calculate for the 11.15 \u03bcm optical depth of \u223c1 are\nhalf of those resulting from the models of Perrin et al.\n(2004) and Perrin et al. (2007).\n\n\f8\n\nRavi et al.\n\n3.4. Modeling the layer opacity\nThe lack of wideband mid-IR spectral information during our observing epochs limits modeling of molecular\ngas and dust species that contribute to the layer opacity.\nWe are able, however, to investigate some basic physical characteristics of the layer using the opacity mechanism described by Tatebe & Townes (2006). This work\nshowed that, for solar abundance gas at temperatures\nsimilar to those in red giant atmospheres, collision processes between neutral hydrogen atoms and free electrons dominate the mid-IR opacity. For temperatures of\n2500 K to 3000 K, the primary sources of free electrons\nwere found to be thermally ionized Na and Al. The abundances of H\u2212 , H2 and H+ relative to H were found to be\ntoo low to contribute to the opacity through collisions\nwith electrons, and photoionization and photodissociation processes were also found to be insignificant. The\nabsorption coefficient due to electron-hydrogen atom collisions, first derived by Dalgarno & Lane (1966), is given\nin simplified form as\n\n\u03b1e =\n\nkB T ne nH A\n\u03bd2\n\n(9)\n\nwhere ne is the electron number density, nH is the hydrogen atom number density, and A is expressed as a thirdorder polynomial in T (Tatebe & Townes 2006). This\nopacity mechanism is used to explain the sizes of the radio photospheres of red giant stars (Reid & Menten 1997;\nLim et al. 1998), at different wavelengths. For example,\nLim et al. (1998) found that the radio photosphere of\nBetelgeuse appeared larger, yet cooler, for longer wavelengths.\nWe consider the implications of this mechanism dominating the mid-IR continuum opacity. Equation 9 can be\nused to calculate hydrogen atom number densities from\nthe fitted layer optical depths. The electron number densities were obtained from Table 2 of Tatebe & Townes\n(2006), which gives the fractional ionizations, relative to\nnH , of various metals at different temperatures. We further used the hydrogen number densities to calculate the\ntotal layer mass, Mlayer , for each epoch, using a distance\nof 197\u00b145 pc to Betelgeuse (Harper et al. 2008). Our results are given in Table 4.\nWe find masses for the layer of between 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 M\u2299\nand 6 \u00d7 10\u22124 M\u2299 . Our values for the hydrogen number\ndensity of between 3.5 \u00d7 1011 cm\u22123 and 9 \u00d7 1011 cm\u22123 ,\nusing a hydrogen atomic mass of 1.67\u00d710\u221224 g, are equivalent to mass densities of \u223c 10\u221213 g cm\u22123 . Such values\nare consistent with the hydrogen density derived for the\nBetelgeuse layer modeled by Perrin et al. (2007), where\nthey derived their hydrogen density by assuming a ratio between the H2 O number density and the hydrogen\nnumber density of nH2 O /nH \u223c 10\u22127 (Jennings & Sada\n1998) and using their calculated values of nH2 O for the\nlayer. Our values for the hydrogen density are therefore also consistent with the values for the water density\nderived by Perrin et al. (2007), though they result from\nvery different methods of calculation.\n4. THE ORIGIN OF THE POINT SOURCES IN THE MID-IR\n\nWe now consider a physical interpretation of the point\nsources used to model the ISI interferometric data on\nBetelgeuse.

All point sources are positive in\nintensity with respect to the star.\nNon-uniformities on the observed stellar disk of Betelgeuse at optical and near-IR wavelengths have been\nreported by several authors (e.g., Buscher et al. 1990;\nHaubois et al. 2009). These asymmetries are generally\nmodeled either as point sources, or as UDs or twodimensional Gaussian profiles of fixed, unresolved size.\nThe intensities of these 'spots' are generally found to be\nbetween 5% and 20% of the intensity of the stellar disk.\nThe distribution and strengths of the spots are found to\nvary significantly across optical and near-IR bands during contemporaneous observations (Young et al. 2000),\nwith the star sometimes appearing featureless in one\nband and highly non-uniform in another. The spots are\nalso found to vary on timescales of less than 8 weeks\n(Wilson et al. 1997). One such spot was recently resolved\nin the H -band by Haubois et al. (2009), who reported a\ndiameter of 0.011\u2032\u2032 for this spot.\nThese results are consistent with a prediction by\nSchwarzschild (1975) for extremely large-scale convection on red giants. Red supergiants are suggested to\nhave only a few tens of convection cells on their surfaces, as opposed to the thousands present on the surface\nof the Sun. Similar predictions also result from threedimensional numerical simulations (e.g., Freytag et al.\n2002; Chiavassa et al. 2009), and an initial attempt at\nmatching simulations to interferometric observations was\nmade by Chiavassa et al. (2010). Schwarzschild (1975)\npredicted temperature fluctuations of up to \u00b11000 K\nwith respect to the photospheric temperatures of red giant stars. This is consistent with the intensities of spots\nobserved in the visible and near-IR.\nThe point sources fitted to our mid-IR data do not\narise directly from large-scale convective features on the\nsurface of Betelgeuse. If we assume a 0.01\u2032\u2032 diameter for\nthe weakest of our point sources (see Table 2), which contributes 0.7% of the 4400 Jy flux density of Betelgeuse in\n2009, its temperature of \u223c660 K above the effective surface temperature, calculated using Equation 2, is consistent with a photospheric hotspot of \u223c1000 K behind the\n\u03c4 = 1 layer. If we assign a similar diameter to any of\nthe other point sources we observe, even greater temperatures would result for associated photospheric hotspots.\nThe mid-IR point sources are hence more intense than\nexpected from surface temperature fluctuations caused\nby giant convection cells (Schwarzschild 1975).

The visibility model fitted to each dataset is specified at the top of each image: the 2006 data were fit with a UD\nand single point source, the 2007 and 2008 data were only fit with a UD, and the 2009 and 2010 data were fit with a UD and two point\nsources. The color bar shows the flux density per pixel for each color depicted, and each pixel is 1.2\u00d71.2 milli-arcseconds in size.\n\n\f10\n\nRavi et al.\n\nmore, every one of our point sources is located beyond\nthe edge of the photospheric disk (see Figure 4).\nIt is clear therefore that the observed asymmetry of\nBetelgeuse in the mid-IR is caused by a non-uniform intensity distribution in the layer. We do not have sufficient sampling of the U V plane in any epoch to identify\nwhether the layer is in fact spherically symmetric, but\nwith temperature fluctuations, or whether the layer is\nextended in particular directions. The point sources can\nalso be explained in terms of opacity inhomogeneities in\nthe layer. In the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation to the\nPlanck law, the effective radiation temperature, TB , of a\ncolumn of material with optical depth \u03c4 and temperature\nT is given by\nTB = T (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 ).\n(10)\n\nFor example, increasing the value of \u03c4 from 1 to 3 increases TB by a factor of 1.5. Non-uniform spatial, temperature and opacity distributions of the Betelgeuse layer\ncould all explain the observed mid-IR non-uniformities.\n5. DISCUSSION\n5.1. The extended atmosphere of Betelgeuse\nMolecular layers directly surrounding the photospheres\nof red supergiant stars, and in particular Betelgeuse, have\nbeen modeled by a variety of authors under differing assumptions for the layer geometry and the dominant opacity source. A layer of water with a column density of\n1020 cm\u22122 at a temperature of \u223c1500 K was first suggested by Tsuji (2000a) for Betelgeuse, based on modeling of near-IR spectra. A combination of spectral and\ninterferometric modeling by Ohnaka (2004), assuming a\nlayer geometry identical to ours, suggested a layer temperature of 2050 K and an outer radius of 1.45R\u2217 , while\nmodeling the mid-IR opacity as being dominated by a\ncontinuum of water emission and absorption lines. Under the assumption of a layer with a well-defined inner\nradius, Tsuji (2006) modeled a shell beyond 1.3R\u2217 with a\ntemperature of 2250 K, again dominated by water opacity. More advanced spectral modeling by Verhoelst et al.\n(2006) revealed that water could not play a dominant\nrole in determining the mid-IR continuum opacity, and\ninstead suggested the presence of amorphous alumina in\nthe molecular layer. This model was consolidated by\nPerrin et al. (2007) to suggest a shell between 1.32R\u2217\nand 1.42R\u2217 at a temperature of 1520 K.\nThe properties we derive for a layer surrounding Betelgeuse, summarised in Table 3 for each observing epoch,\nare largely consistent with these results. We find temperatures that vary between 1900 K and 2800 K and outer\nradii that vary between 1.14R\u2217 and 1.36R\u2217 . Our modeling technique most closely matched that of Perrin et al.\n(2004) in assuming thermal continuum emission from the\nlayer within our observing band. This assumption is justified by the featureless spectrum of Betelgeuse within,\nand around, our observing band and by the lack of any\nsignificant water lines within and surrounding our band\n(Weiner et al. 2003b). The results are consistent with\nprevious models of the Betelgeuse layer.\nA consistent picture of the composition of the layer has,\nhowever, not been achieved. While spectral modeling has\nuncovered the presence of numerous molecular species,\nincluding H2 O, CO, SiO and possibly CN, as well as alumina dust (Tsuji 2006; Perrin et al. 2007; Kervella et al.\n\n2009), the opacity of the layer as a function of wavelength is not yet fully determined. Our results for the\noptical depth of the layer of \u223c1 at 11.15 \u03bcm wavelength\nare not in agreement with those of Perrin et al. (2004)\nand Perrin et al. (2007), who obtain optical depths of\n\u223c2.\nThe number density of atomic hydrogen, based on the\n11.15 \u03bcm opacity arising from electron-hydrogen atom\ncollisions, is \u223c1011 cm\u22123 . This density, given the derived layer size, corresponds to H2 O column densities\nof 1019 cm\u22122 ; this result is consistent with H2 O column\ndensities measured by Jennings & Sada (1998) and those\nderived from spectral modeling (e.g., Tsuji 2006). We\ntherefore suggest that electron-hydrogen atom collisions\nplay a significant role in determining the mid-IR continuum opacity of the Betelgeuse layer, and that this mechanism must also be accounted for in models for the layer\ncomposition.\nWe have shown that the layer of material surrounding\nthe photosphere of Betelgeuse has a non-uniform intensity distribution. A similar result was recently reported\nby Ohnaka et al. (2011) based on interferometric measurements of the one-dimensional intensity and velocity\nprofile of CO gas in the inner atmosphere of Betelgeuse.\nOhnaka et al. (2011) also reported a change in the onedimensional CO intensity and velocity profile between\ntwo epochs spaced by a year. We find that the intensity distribution of the layer varies between each the five\nobserving epochs we present, which are also spaced by\napproximately one year.\nThe non-uniformities that we observe in the layer reflect, on much smaller spatial scales, the non-uniformities\nobserved in various components of the circumstellar environment of Betelgeuse. A gaseous component at similar temperatures to the Betelgeuse layer was shown to\nhave an asymmetric intensity distribution by Lim et al.\n(1998). Our observations and those of Lim et al. (1998)\ncould be linked by the opacities in both wavelength\nbands being partly caused by electron-hydrogen atom\ncollisions. The opacity due to this mechanism is proportional to \u03bd \u22122 , implying that the observed stellar\nsize decreases with shorter observing wavelengths. Material at chromospheric temperatures is also observed\nto be asymmetrically distributed (Hebden et al. 1987;\nGilliland & Dupree 1996), and observations of a circumstellar envelope by Kervella et al. (2009) at near-IR\nwavelengths also reveal significant asymmetry. Asymmetry in the large-scale (\u223c1\u2032\u2032 ) dust distribution surrounding\nBetelgeuse was also observed by Bloemhof et al. (1985).\nMolecular layer models have been applied to the few\nred supergiant stars that have been observed with sufficient spatial resolution, such as \u03bc Cephei (Perrin et al.\n2005; Tsuji 2006) and \u03b1 Herculis (Ohnaka 2004). Similar layers are identified around AGB stars (Weiner et al.\n2003a; Ohnaka et al. 2005). The properties of individual red supergiant layers vary significantly from star to\nstar, and a greater sample of measurements is required to\nunderstand what determines individual layer properties.\n5.2. Implications of the results reported for red\n\nsupergiant mass-loss\nThe processes by which red supergiant stars form and\naccelerate dust, while crucial to mass-loss scenarios, are\nlittle understood. Existing models of stellar atmospheres\n\n\fThe mid-IR atmosphere of Betelgeuse\n\nFig. 5.- Plot of the visual magnitude, and total 11.15 \u03bcm flux\ndensity, of Betelgeuse over the period 2006\u22122010. The visual magnitude measurements, joined by a solid line, are 30-day averages\nof data obtained from the AAVSO online archive. The 11.15 \u03bcm\nflux density measurements, also listed in Table 1, are shown here\nas crosses. The timespans of each ISI observing epoch are bounded\nby vertical dotted lines.\n\n(e.g., Gustafsson et al. 2008; Plez 2010) cannot predict\nlocations for dust condensation, and attempts to model\ndust acceleration through radiation pressure have also\nso far been unsuccessful (e.g., Woitke 2007). Our multiepoch study of a layer directly surrounding Betelgeuse\nprovides new insight into the processes involved in red\nsupergiant mass-loss.\nWe have shown that the basic properties of the layer,\ngiven in Table 3, exhibit striking variability from year\nto year. The layer is found to decrease in size and increase in optical depth over the years 2006 \u2212 2008, and\nincrease in size and decrease in optical depth between\n2009 \u2212 2010. The layer temperature does not show such\nsystematic variability, although the largest layer size (in\n2010) does correspond to the highest temperature. The\nvariability in the apparent mid-IR size of Betelgeuse reported by Townes et al. (2009) can also be interpreted to\nindicate variations in the layers. Intriguingly, a similar\nphenomenon was reported by Pease (1922), who noted a\ndecrease in the size of Betelgeuse at visible wavelengths\nfollowed by an increase.\nFigure 5 shows measurements of the visual magnitude\nof Betelgeuse during between 2006 and 2010, as well as\nthe ISI measurements of the total 11.15\u03bcm flux density\n(also listed in Table 1). The timespans of the ISI observing epochs are also plotted. The visual magnitude\nmeasurements were obtained from the online database2\nof the American Association of Variable Star Observers\n(AAVSO). The data, collected by a multitude of volunteer observers, were averaged over 30-day timespans;\neach timespan with less than 10 measurements was discarded. The visual variability of Betelgeuse over our observing epochs was approximately 0.9 magnitudes. The\nvisual intensity of Betelgeuse is not likely to represent\nthat of the photosphere because the apparent stellar diameter at visible wavelengths is greater than that at\nnear-IR wavelengths (Young et al. 2000). Also, using\n2\n\nhttp://www.aavso.org/data-download\n\n11\n\ncontemporaneous interferometric observations of Betelgeuse at different wavelengths, Young et al. (2000) found\nthat hotspots evident in the visible were not present in\nthe near-IR. Observations of Betelgeuse at visible wavelengths could represent regions within the layer observed\nat mid-IR wavelengths. It is interesting that the midIR flux density of Betelgeuse, as well as the effective\ntemperatures plotted in Figure 3, and the visual magnitude appear somewhat correlated, particularly in their\nincrease during the 2009 and 2010 epochs. Previous authors (Kiss et al. 2006) have concluded that the visual\nvariability of Betelgeuse is probably indicative of quasiperiodic pulsations, and is too great to be explained by\nvariations in the hotspot distribution.\nThe layer of material surrounding Betelgeuse is a candidate location for the onset of dust formation. A number of authors have identified the presence of alumina\ndust directly above the photosphere (Verhoelst et al.\n2006; Perrin et al. 2007; Verhoelst et al. 2009). The\nderived physical parameters of the layer, such as the\ntemperatures and hydrogen mass densities, are suitable\nfor the formation of amorphous alumina (Woitke 2006;\nDirks et al. 2008). While some aspects of the modeled\nvariability of the layer might be due to variations in the\nphotosphere, measurements of changes in the apparent\nmid-IR appearance of Betelgeuse must be largely caused\nby variations in the layer. If alumina contributes significantly to the mid-IR continuum opacity, these variations would represent variations in the dust content of\nthe layer. Our estimates of changes in the mass of the\nlayer, on the order of 10\u22124 M\u2299 (see Table 4), might indicate evolution in the layer.\nThe point sources we observe in the layer of material surrounding Betelgeuse and their changes suggest\nthat the layer dynamics are anisotropic. Asymmetries\nobserved in the circumstellar environment of Betelgeuse\nare generally linked to the presence of giant convection\ncells on the stellar surface. Such convection cells are\nthought to shape the circumstellar environment of Betelgeuse by elevating cool photospheric material (Lim et al.\n1998) and driving large-scale chromospheric motions\n(Gilliland & Dupree 1996). Our results indicate that giant convection cells have a significant role in shaping the\nBetelgeuse layer. This is because the mechanism that elevates the layer material above the photosphere is clearly\nanisotropic. The large intensities of the observed pointsource components imply the action of large-scale photospheric features, and their variability between observing\nepochs demonstrates the transient nature of the cause of\nthe point sources. Changes in the distribution of convection cells on the photosphere of Betelgeuse could also\ninfluence the overall layer properties. While the nature\nof the non-uniform brightness distribution of the layer\nis yet to be determined, our observations represent evidence for the role of giant convection cells in shaping the\ninner atmosphere of Betelgeuse.\n5.3. Future work\nObservations of a sample of red supergiant stars with\nhigh spatial resolution and wide bandwidth, over multiple epochs, are necessary to form a general picture for\nthe role of molecular layers in mass-loss processes. More\ndetailed interferometric imaging of Betelgeuse at mid-IR\nwavelengths is also required to understand the true role\n\n\f12\n\nRavi et al.\n\nof giant convection cells in shaping the layer. Simultaneous visible, near-IR, and mid-IR interferometry could\nalso provide interesting information on correspondences\nbetween different regions of the layer. Interferometric\nstudies with both high spatial resolution and high spectral resolution are planned for the ISI (Wishnow et al.\n2010), and have been performed at near-IR wavelengths\nby Ohnaka et al. (2009) and Ohnaka et al. (2011). Such\ninvestigations are aimed at revealing the molecular compositions, kinematic structures and true extents of red\nsupergiant layers. More detailed modeling of layer\nopacities is also required, taking into account contributions from molecular absorption and emission, dust and\nelectron-hydrogen atom collisions. Upcoming optical and\ninfrared interferometer systems, such as the Magdalena\nRidge Observatory Interferometer and the MATISSE instrument at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer,\nas well as high spatial resolution observations with the\nnext generation of extremely large telescopes could finally clarify our understanding of red supergiant mass\nloss.\n6. CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe ISI has been used to conduct observations of Betelgeuse over 2006\u22122010 in the mid-IR continuum with high\nspatial resolution. By fitting visibility and closure phase\nmeasurements with image models, the apparent stellar\nsize was measured at each observing epoch, and up to\ntwo point sources were sometimes detected at the edge\nof the stellar disk. The results were interpreted in terms\nof an absorbing layer surrounding an assumed 3641 K\nphotosphere. We have shown that:\n\n1. Observations during every epoch can be modeled\nin terms of a layer surrounding the photosphere,\nwith optical depths of \u223c1 at 11.15 \u03bcm wavelength,\nouter sizes between 1.16R\u2217 and 1.36R\u2217, and temperatures between 1900 K and 2800 K.\n2. Electron-hydrogen atom collisions contribute to the\nopacity of the layer.\n3. Assuming a non-varying photosphere, the layer exhibits significant variability.\n4. The layer has a non-uniform intensity distribution\nthat also varies from year to year.\nBoth the non-uniformity and the variability of the modeled layer suggest that giant convection cells play an important role in shaping the inner atmosphere and the\nmass-loss dynamics of Betelgeuse.\nW.
