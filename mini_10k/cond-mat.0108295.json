INTRODUCTION\nAttempts to exceed the temperature of transition to superconductivity (\u0422\u0441) 39 \u041a [1] in the AB2\ndiborides row with the AlB2 structure have until no success. However, the presence of some\ncommon crystal chemical characteristics in diborides and high-temperature superconductor cuprate\n(HTSC) cuprates allows to expect that possibility of raising \u0422\u0441 in these compounds still exist.\nIntensive study of MgB2 had shown that as in HTSC cuprates the layered nature of MgB2 is caused\nanisotropic superconducting properties [2, 3]. It was shown that Tc of MgB2 either as in HTSC\ncuprates depends on the concentration of charge carriers [4, 5] and structural parameters [6, 7]. The\nsimilar ways of variation in concentration of charge carriers and structural parameters by isovalent\nand non-isovalent doping [7, 8-15] and by pressure [5, 16-23] also were considered. It was\n\n\festablished that in diborides the B2 planes contain such carriers of charge as holes (p) and play the\nsame role as the CuO2 in high-Tc cuprates [4, 24, 25]. In AB2 these planes there are between the\nplanes of positive charged \"ions\" A, as the CuO2 planes in perovskite layer An+1(CuO2)n. Note, that\nin the last this is reached for account of displacement or full removing the apical oxygen atoms from\nplane of A cations on consequence of Jan-Teller effect.\nIn [26] we have shown that the simplest structural fragment in HTSC cuprates is not one\nCuO2 plane but A2(CuO2) sandwich, in which the CuO2 plane with charge carriers is situated\nbetween the planes of A-cations, and have installed the correlation of Tc with critical crystal\nchemical parameters of this sandwich general for all phases of HTSC cuprates. It is possible to\nexpect that in diborides AB2 of such structural fragment is the A2(B2) sandwich, where the network\nof B atoms with charge carriers is situated between the planes of A \"cations\".\nIn this work we consider a dependence of Tc from crystal chemical parameters of A2(B2)\nsandwich in diborides like found in HTSC cuprates and discuss the possibilities and ways to rise Tc\nin this class of compounds.\n2. METHOD\nIn high\u2013Tc cuprates Tc dependence on crystal chemical parameters of the A2(CuO2) fragment is\nmore full expressed by combination of such values as distances d(Cu-Cu) in CuO2 plane and ones\nd(CuO2-A) from CuO2 plane to adjacent plane of A cations, which have an original sense and give\nalso an information about the hole concentration, and on the size and charge of A-cations and\ndoping atoms too. In [26] we established the empirical dependence of Tc from the ratio (J) of\ndistances between Cu atoms along diagonal direction of CuO2-plane to sum \"effective\" distances\n(D1+D2) from CuO2 plane to of two adjacent planes of A cations in An+1(CuO2)n layer, taking into\naccount the charge and the size of A-cations and doping atoms (J = d(Cu-Cu)/(D1+D2)).\nFor plotting the dependence of Tc(J) in AB2 where\nJ = d ( B \u2212 B) /( D1 + D2 )\n\n(1)\n\nwe have chosen critical parameters of A2(B2) fragment, like found in high\u2013Tc cuprates, such as:\n1. The d(B-B) distances between B atoms situated at the ends of diagonal of hexagons in B2\nplane ( d ( B \u2212 B ) = 2a / 3 ), i.e., at the maximal possible distance from one another. It is\nsupposed, that the diagonal pairing and oscillation of holes on B atoms are energetically more\nfavourable than other configurations [27];\n\n2\n\n\f2.\n\n\"Effective\" distances D1 and D2 from B2 plane to surface of two adjacent planes of A\n\"cations\":\nD = S [d ( B 2 \u2212 A) \u2212 R A ( Z A / 2)]\n\n(2)\n\nwhere d(B2-A) is the distance from B2 plane to plane of A \"cations\"; RA is radius of A\n\"cation\", which content is maximum; ZA/2 \u2013 undimensional coefficient to take into\naccount of the electric field of the A \"cation\" charge (it is the ratio of charge A \"cation\" to\ncharge of Mg cation), S is deviation coefficient of parameters of doping cations from\nparameters of A-cation that forms the plane:\nS\u22651, S = R ( Z / 2) / R A ( Z A / 2) or S = R A ( Z A / 2) / R ( Z / 2)\n\n(3)\n\nHere R (Z / 2) is generalized value, characterized the plane of A-cations:\nR ( Z / 2) = m1 R A1 ( Z A1 / 2) + ...mn R An ( Z An / 2)\n\n(4)\n\nwhere mn is content of An \"cation\" in plane, R An is radius, Z An / 2 \u2013 undimensional\ncoefficient to take into account of the electric field of the An \"cation\" charge.\nOn value J an enormous influence renders a size and a charge (valence states) of A \"cations\".\nTo value these parameters in intermetal compounds is not easy. By interpretation the result on\ndiborides practically in all works the Pauling \"crystal\" ion radii are used [28]. However, this system\nreflects unadequately the changing of a lattice parameter c by changing a radius of A \"cations\". So,\nlattice parameter c of AlB2 (3.26 \u00c5) is noticeable less than c parameter of MgB2 (3.52 \u00c5) [29].\nPauling radii (RP) Al (0.75 \u00c5), opposite, exceeds a radius of Mg (0.65 \u00c5). Proceeding from\napproximately linear correlations between c parameters of diborides and A radius the Shannon\ncrystal radius (RSh) is more suitable. In Fig. 1, lattice parameters \u0441 are plotted as a function of\nShannon (a) and Pauling (b) radii of A \"cations\". However, J was calculated by using both Pauling\nand Shannon radii systems with standard coordination 6 and valent state equal group number in\nPeriodic system, excluding Mn, Cr, Ru and Os. The valent state of Mn and Cr was accepted as 4+\nand 3+, accordingly, but Ru and Os as 6+. Moreover, Ru radius was accepted such as for Os, as\nthere is no data about Ru radius.\nBesides, for the plotting of Tc(J) it is necessary to know Tc of sample and its full structural data\n(atomic coordinates and occupancy positions) obtained by X-ray and neutron diffraction. It is not\nsufficiently the only data about unit cell parameters, as the vacancies in A plane can change a J\nvalue and, accordingly, Tc but the vacancies in B2 plane, as in CuO2 plane of HTSC cuprates, reduce\nTc or suppress completely a superconductivity. Besides, the impurities in A-planes can be distributed\n\n3\n\n\firregularly along the c axis, as that was shown in [13] for Mg1-xAlxB2 by high-resolution\ntransmission-electron microscopy investigation. This will certainly result in a change and inequality\nof \"effective\" distances D1 and D2, accordingly, and to change J and superconducting\ncharacteristics. There isn't now such data on doping borides.\nRealistically it is installed only the following:\n(1) Crystal structure of diborides, lattice parameters and Tc of polycrystalline and tin films of\nmany MgB2 samples [1, 5, 7, 31-35], and the structural data obtained by X-ray diffraction\nanalysis on single crystal of only one MgB2 sample [36], as well as the lattice parameters\nand the absence of superconductivity in AlB2[10, 12, 13];\n(2) Reducing of MgB2 Tc with the growing of pressure (P). Moreover the spread of dTc/dP\nreported by different groups [5, 16-23] is high and is explained in [21] by various in the\nsample stoichiometry.\n(3) The substitution of Al for Mg in MgB2 decreases the Tc and leads to the loss of\nsuperconductivity in Mg1-xAlxB2 with the growing x [7, 10-13].\nIt has been also found the superconducting transition at Tc=9.5 K for TaB2 [37, 38] and no\nsuperconducting for TiB2, HfB2, ZrB2, VB2 and NbB2. Although this result contradicts the data\nreported in [39], by which ZrB2 is superconducting with Tc=5.5 K, and T\u0430B2 and NbB2 are not.\nFurther to this we have the experimental and theoretical data on superconductivity and structural\nproperties of Mg1-xAxB2 (A = Al, Zn, \u0421\u0430 and Na [7-13, 40] and only structural parameters of the\nother members of the AB2 family (A = Ru, Os, Cr, Mn, Mo, W, V, Nb, Ta, Ti, Zr, Hf, Sc, Y, Cu,\nAg, Au Lu, Pu and U) [29, 41-62] on superconducting properties of which not yet made final\nconclusions.\nIn this connection we have calculated two variants of Tc(J) correlation: with only real data for\ncompounds MgB2 (single crystal) [36], AlB2 [29, 57] and disputable data on TaB2 [37] or ZrB2\n[39]. The both systems of radii (RSh and RP) were used by this calculation. As a result we have\ngot two correlations for the variant-I ( TcTa , RSh ( J RSh ) and TcTa.RP ( J R P ) (Fig. 2 a)) and two\ncorrelations for variant-II ( TcZr , RSh ( J RSh ) and TcZr , RP ( J RP ) (Fig. 2 b)). The equations of second\ndegree polynomial give the best approximation of the correlations:\n2\nTcTa , RSh = \u22126.05213 J RSh\n\u2212 16.9383 J RSh + 95.324 , there midpoint J0 = -1.30395, Tc, max=107; (5)\n2\nTcTa , RP = \u22129.93835 J RP\n\u2212 68.1881J RP + 173.101 , there midpoint J0 = -3.38595, Tc, max=290; (6)\n2\nTcZr , RSh = 1.21806 J RSh\n\u2212 51.7357 J RSh + 135.714 , there midpoint J0 = 20.8830, Tc, min= -413; (7)\n\n4\n\n\f2\nTcZr , RP = 11.0727 J RP\n\u2212 143.304 J RP + 239.537 , there midpoint J0 = 6.3148 Tc, min= -224;\n\n(8)\n\nThen, for the estimation of validity of these two correlation variants J RSh and J RP by\nformula (1) and corresponding them Tc on equations (5-8) for 100 considered diborides were\ncalculated. It was found that parabolic dependencies TcTa , RSh ( J RSh ) and TcTa.RP ( J RP ) of Eq. 5\nand 6 obtained on the data for MgB2, AlB2 and TaB2 estimate adequately a trend of changing Tc\nof MgB2 with the growing of pressure, and Mg1-xAlxB2 with x increase, and confirm also an\nabsence of superconductivity in ZrB2 [37] (Table I). However, a velocity of linear falling Tc\n(dTc/dP and dTc/dx) calculated on these correlations is more below than experimental [7, 1013]. Moreover, according the data, obtained by these correlations, a very small changing of\nlattice paramers can result in the lost of superconductivity in TaB2. So, TaB2 (Table I, sample N\n28) in which the authors [39] did not find a superconductivity, by calculations on correlation\n\nTcTa. RP ( J RP ) of Eq. 6 also is not a superconductor, but on correlation TcTa , RSh ( J RSh ) of Eq. (5)\nit must be superconductor with Tc = 7.4K. Here and further the number of compound in Table I\nis parenthetically shown. The calculation of Tc for TaB2 (N 29 [29, 44] and N30 [54]) with\nincreasing parameter c points to the absence of superconductivity by both correlations.\nCorrelations TcZr , RSh ( J RSh ) and TcZr , RP ( J RP ) of Eqs. (7) and (8) built with of using of\ndata on ZrB2 [39], probably, have no physical sense, as fare as it is impossible to explain a\nsudden disappearance and appearance of superconductivity. Besides, Tc calculated on the base\nof these correlations disagrees to experimental data this work [39], as far as indicates not on the\nabsence but opposite on the presence of superconductivity with unrealistic high Tc for diborides\nNb, Ta and W, V, Hf, Pu, U also.\nThereby, a estimation has shown that the correlations of TcTa , RSh ( J RSh ) and TcTa. RP ( J RP )\nare the most reliable. However, its can show only a trend Tc change with changing of crystal\nchemical parameters of diborides, as for its building there was too little experimental data. The\nTc calculated on these correlations are referred to the diborides of stoichiometric composition,\nsince there was no data for the account of non-stoichiometry of compounds by J calculation,\nwhile the last studies [16, 63, 64] point to Mg-deficiency and defects even in MgB2. As a result,\ncalculated TcTa , RSh of MgB2 are little below than Tc found experimentally ( Tcexp ). However,\ndeficit of Mg (0.8, 0.9 and 1%) in samples, N54, 59 and 53 (Table), accordingly, raises TcTa , RSh\n(38.1 \u2013 38.3 K) calculated on the Eq. (5) to the experimental values (38.8 \u2013 39 K).\n\n5\n\n\f3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nMaximal Tc values for diborides, calculated on correlation of TcTa , RSh ( J RSh ) and\n\nTcTa. RP ( J RP ) (Eqs. (5) and (6)) are 107 K at optimal value J=J0 (by J0 = -1.304) and 290 K (by\nJ0 = -3.386), accordingly. Increasing Tc of diborides AB2 by nearing J to J0 (Fig. 2 a) on the left\noccurs by shortening the distances d(B-B) in B2 plane and \"effective\" interplanar distances D1\nand D2. (As on the given interval D1 and D2 have negative values the modules D1 and D2 must\nincrease). This is possible from shortening the lattice parameters a and c, reducing a size of A\natom and increasing its charge. Moreover, the most effect is reached when a charge of atom is\nincreasing. So, WB2 (N5) has the most high Tc (99.7 K and 290 K according to correlations\n\nTcTa , RSh ( J RSh ) and TcTa. RP ( J RP ) ) amongst considered diborides with J<J0.\nBesides, to rise Tc of diborides with J<J0 is possible by increasing S coefficient to the\naccount of introduction of vacancies in A layer or partial substitution A on the ions of smaller\nsize or insignificantly differing from the size, but having smaller charge. For instance, Tc of\nWB2 and MoB2 raise is possible by doping of W and Mo planes with the ions Ru4+, Os4+, V5+,\nTi4+ (N18), Nb5+ (N17) or Al3+, but for TaB2 by doping of Ta plane with Al3+ (N34), Ti4+ (N33)\nor V5+( N31) ions. For arising a superconductivity in NbB2 it is necessary to introduce Nbvacancies or substitute part of Nb5+ on Al3+ (N41), Ti4+ or V5+ (N42). The Tc of diborides with\nJ<J0 must increase under the action of pressure, unlike MgB2, where J>J0.\nHowever, superconductors with J<J0, having high Tc, are hitherto not discovered. As it is\nmentioned above, TaB2 is a superconductor at Tc = 9.5 K [35]. Cooper at al. [65] reported also,\nthat in \"boron-rich\" NbB2 compounds a superconductivity appears at Tc = 3.87 K, and in\nZr0.13Mo0.87B2 at Tc = 11 K. To our regret, the work [65] is inaccessible for us, but if expect that\nby substituting Mo on 13% Zr the lattice parameters \u0430 and \u0441 enlarged to 3.08 \u00c5 and 3.32 \u00c5,\naccordingly, and there are no vacancies in B2 plane, Tc of Zr0.13Mo0.87B2, calculated on Eq. (6)\nand Eq. (5) are 11 \u041a and 86 \u041a, accordingly.\nProbably, a boron deficit in plane B2 is a reason of absence of superconductivity in the\ndiborides with J<J0. It is possible a compression of \u0430 parameter caused by reducing a size of\n\u00abcation\u00bb A can rezult in arising the vacancies in plane B2. Consequently, a decrease Tc of\ncompound appears up to full suppress its superconductivity. On the contrary, substitution in\n\n6\n\n\fMoB2 of part of Mo6+ ions on large Zr4+ ions with lower charge allows to obtain \"boron-rich\"\ndiboride Zr0.13Mo0.87B2 that is a superconducting properties. A problem appears to conservate a\nstoichiometry in B2 plane in the diborides AB2 with J<J0 for the achievement of high Tc. May\nbe, this can be reached only by partial substituting A on more large \"cations\" with the lower\ncharge. Such substitution reduces Tc, that takes place in initial diborides but allows to obtain the\nsuperconductors with sufficiently high Tc. Dopants saving stoichiometry on boron for AB2 (A =\nW, Mo, Ru or Os) can be the following cations: Pb2+, Mg2+, Ag2+, Sc3+, Y3+, Zr4+, Sn4+, Pb4+,\nU4+ and Th4+.\nIn diborides with J>J0, unlike diborides with J<J0, Tc increase, when J nears to J0 on the\nright, occurs not with reducing but with increasing \"effective\" interplanar distances D1 and D2.\nBy this as well as in the diborides with J<J0 the d(B-B) distances must decrease or its increase\nis more slow than D1 and D2 raising. This can be reached by increasing \u0441 lattice parameter with\nheightening the sizes of main or doping atoms of A plane and/or a S coefficient to the account\nof introducing the vacancies in A plane or partial substitution A on the ions of greater size or\nones insignificantly differing from the size but with another charge. Experimentally proved [7,\n10-13] that substituting Al on Mg in AlB2 results in arising superconductivity and increase Tc to\n39K in Al1-xMgxB2 with x growing. This substituting is accompanied with reducing J by in\novertaking growing of interplanar distances D1and D2 (N 80-88).\nUsually inverse processes are considered, i.e. the suppress of superconductivity in MgB2\nby substituting Mg on Al or by pressing. Using the structural parameters from works [7, 17, 18,\n40] we calculated the change of Tc of MgB2 from pressure (N70-79) and Mg1-xAlxB2 from x\nparameter (N 80-88). In both events J increasing, accompanied by Tc falling, occurs by greater\nreducing \u0441 parameter in contrast to the parameter \u0430. However, the linear reduction Tc calculated\non equations (5) and (6) with increase P or x vastly below found in the experiment [5, 7, 1023]. It is possible, that in this case as in the diborides with J<J0, a reason of increasing a\nvelocity of Tc falling is raising a loss of boron atoms by shortening a parameter with the\ngrowing of pressure or x increase.\nIt is shown by experiment that isovalent substitution of Mg2+ on Zn2+ which size is only\nlittle more (RSh =0 .88 \u00c5, RP = 0.74 \u00c5) than Mg (RSh = 0.86 \u00c5, RP = 0.65 \u00c5) can very small\nto rise T\u0441 [9]. Our calculations (N 96-100) also confirm this conclusion. In work [7] it is\ntheoretically predicted that partial substituting in MgB2 of Mg2+ on Ca2+ or Na1+ must result in\nthe growing Tc up to 52 K or 53 K, accordingly. Calculated by us structural parameters Tc of\n\n7\n\n\fthese systems are close to the data of [7]: with the growing x from 0 to 0.2 TcTa , RSh ( TcTa. RP ) of\nthe systems Mg(1-x)CaxB2 (N 85, 89-92) and Mg(1-x)NaxB2 (N 85, 93-95) goes up to 47 K (59 K)\nand 50 K (57 K), accordingly.\nIt follows from this that Tc raising in MgB2 can be reached by conservation of\nstoichiometry in B2 plane by means of increasing the effective interplanar distances D1 and D2\nby partial substituting Mg2+ on the ions of greater size with charges 1+ or 2+, such as Na1+,\nK1+, Cd2+ or Ca2+.\nIt that way, the empirical dependence of Tc(J) can be useful for the\nprognostication of the composition of new diborides with high Tc, and also for the estimation of\n\u0422\u0441 and the correctness of determination of the structure AB2 and the composition of A-cation\nplanes. The J value is not a simple ratio of geometric structural parameters of diborides. As in\nHTSC cuprates [27] a value of J ratio depends on all these factors which influence on Tc found\nexperimentally, such as d(B-B) and d(B2-A), which have an original sense and give also an\ninformation about the hole concentration, and on the size and charge of A \u00abcations\" and doping\natoms too.\n4. CONCLUSIONS\nIn our work we examined a possibility of increasing Tc in AB2 diborides with the structure\nof AlB2 on the ground of empirical correlation of Tc with the crystal chemical parameters of\nanisotropic three-dimensional fragment \u2013 A2(B2)\u2013sandwich, as there is in HTSC cuprates. By\nthis parabolic dependence, Tc is correlated with the ratio (J) of d(B-B) distances between B\natoms situated at the ends of diagonal of hexagons in B2 plane and sum of \"effective\" distances\n(D1+D2) from B2 plane to two adjacent planes of A \"cations\", taking into account by calculation\na charge size of these cations and doping atoms (J = d(B-B)/(D1+D2)). We calculate the Tc of\ndiborides by this correlation (Table I). It follows:\n\u2022 Among the diborides considered a superconductivity can to be only in diborides W, Mo, Ru,\nOs and \u0422\u0430, where J<J0, and Mg, Cu(II), Ag(I) and Au(I), where J>J0. The result obtained\nthere suggest that the empirical absence or low-temperature superconductivity established in\ntransition metal diborides with J<J0 might be explained of presence B vacancies in B2 plane.\nIn the absence of vacancies in B2 plane Tc of AB2 diborides (A=W, Mo, Ru, Os) can be\nhigher 77K, and in TaB2 to reach 10K. For appearance of superconductivity and increasing\n\n8\n\n\fTc in NbB2 and TaB2 to need introduction of Nb(Ta)-vacancies or partial substitution of\nNb5+ (Ta5+) on Al3+, Ti4+ or V5+.\n\u2022 Partial substitution of W, Mo, Ru and Os on more large cations with lower charge decreases\n\u0422\u0441 with respect to one in initial diborides, but allows to conservate a stoichiometry in B2\nplane and to make a superconductors with enough high Tc.\n\u2022 Partial substitution in MgB2 of Mg on larger but with lower charge \"cations\" must heighten\nTc.\n\u2022 By the pressure Tc must increase in superconductors with J<J0 and decrease in ones with\nJ>J0.\n\u2022 Critical crystal chemical parameters controlling Tc, apart from the concentration of charge\ncarriers in B2 plane, are the distances between boron atoms in B2 plane and the parameters\ncharacterised the space between of B2 plane and \u0410 \"cation\" planes in sandwich A2(B2), such\nas: an interval between the surface of the planes, the inhomogeneity surface of A-cation\nplanes, and also the electric fields induced by the A \"cations\" and doping \"cations\" charges.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by the Russian Foundation for Basic research under grant 00-03-32486.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
