The present-day nuclear structure theory exhibits a great degree of synergy with respect to methods\nthat are used to describe various phenomena in heavy nuclear systems. From few-body methods, through the shell\nmodel to mean-field approaches, the bridges are being built between different ways of describing the stable as\nwell as the most exotic nuclei. In the present talk, I give a review of several selected subjects that are currently at\nthe fore front of new developments in this domain of nuclear science.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nHeavy atomic nuclei belong to the class of many-body systems that are too complex for a direct description from first\nprinciples, and too small for a quantitative statistical approach. Quantum effects, strong interactions, and repulsive\ncore are common features of several physical systems, like nuclei, metal clusters and grains, and atomic clouds, that\nare at present intensively studied.\nThe fact that nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction is a long-range remnant of the QCD interactions between quarks\nand gluons coupled to colorless states, and hence is not known in a closed form, adds all the more to the complexity\nof nuclear systems. Although on-shell properties of the NN interactions in the vacuum are phenomenologically very\nwell known and parametrized, see, e.g., Ref. [1], the off-shell properties are not. Nevertheless, light nuclei (up to A=10\nnucleons) can be with a large success described by direct methods based on phenomenological NN potentials [2, 3].\nHowever, much work is being performed, and even more is needed, to achieve a more complete state of knowledge of\nthe NN and NNN interactions.\nA direct description of heavy nuclei, based on the NN interactions and leading to a complete wave function, is\nneither feasible nor, in fact, sensible. Only a limited number of specific states of heavy nuclei, mostly at low energies,\ncan be studied in experiment. These states do not depend on the whole complexity of the NN interactions, and do not\nprobe the whole A-body Hilbert space. Therefore, a great deal of effort and success in nuclear structure physics has\nbeen devoted to deriving effective interactions that would describe main features of nuclei within a restricted space.\nDue to applications of the effective field theory and renormalization group techniques, such derivations are recently\ngaining dramatically new momentum [4, 5].\nShell-model calculations that use derived effective interactions are by now possible for systems with A\u223c12 nucleons\n[6]. These methods look very promising, and can probably be applied to still heavier systems. It is extremely\nencouraging that similar shell-model calculations using phenomenological effective interactions fitted to data, are very\nsuccessful in describing properties of all nuclei with up to about A\u223c50 particles [7]. In special cases such methods can\nbe even used in much heavier systems. This shows that basic low-energy properties of nuclei are indeed governed by\nrelatively simple two-body effective interactions acting in manageable Hilbert spaces, and gives us hope that derived\neffective interactions may become a link between the NN forces and the present-day phenomenology in heavy nuclei.\nSignificant progress was achieved in recent years in a phenomenological mean-field description of a multitude of\nnuclear states and phenomena. Although detailed formulations vary, most mean-field approaches are presently based\non the energy density formalism, either in a relativistic or non-relativistic flavor. On the other hand, much too little work\nhas been done to derive the energy density functionals from the underlying NN forces and/or effective interactions.\nThis direction of research is far behind the analogous efforts and successes achieved in molecular physics, and will\nprobably see a substantial increase of activity in the coming years.\nIn general, mean-field methods correctly reproduce the main features of structure of heavy nuclei. Very often,\nhowever, this is not sufficient, and a higher degree of precision is requested from theoretical descriptions in order to\n\n\funderstand fine-scale nuclear phenomena. In particular, the limits of nuclear binding depend on a detailed balance\nbetween the bulk, surface, and pairing effects, see, e.g., Ref. [8]. Although a large progress has recently been\nachieved [9], a microscopic description of nuclear binding energies within a 100 keV precision is, for the moment,\nan unreachable goal. Similarly, detailed properties of rotational bands give us extremely precise information on the\nstructure of microscopic states, and are fairly well understood on the phenomenological level, whereas a link to the\ncorresponding terms in the energy functional is still unclear.\nIn the present talk, a number of recent specific achievements in the theoretical studies of heavy nuclei are briefly discussed. For example, deformations and halos in heavy neutron-drip nuclei, as well as widths of one-body resonances,\nwere calculated with the coupling of bound and continuum states taken into account. A great progress in understanding proton-neutron correlations in N\u223cZ nuclei was achieved. New kind of collective motion, the magnetic rotation,\nwas predicted and found in experiment. Origins of the pseudospin symmetry are now being traced back to simple\nrelativistic single-particle effects. Self-consistent calculations of superheavy nuclei gave us a new insight into the shell\nstructure in the presence of a very strong Coulomb field. Since it would be impossible to give here a full bibliography\nof the discussed subjects, only the recent works are usually cited, and more references can be found there. There are\nalso many other subject that cannot be presented here because of limited space; some of them are covered in other\nplenary talks [7, 10, 11] during this conference. The reader may also wish to consult the contents of nuclear-structure\ntalks that have been given during the previous INPC'98 conference [12], where the three-years-ago status of the field\nwas presented.\n\nSHELL MODEL EMBEDDED IN THE CONTINUUM\nTheoretical description of properties of weakly bound nuclei requires new methods that take into account the continuum phase space explicitly. Traditional shell-model approaches use well-bound single-particle states, most frequently\nthe harmonic oscillator (HO) basis, to define the Fock space of many-nucleon configurations. Within such a space, particle emission threshold is completely absent, and a large fraction of obtained excited states (even all of them in case\nof weakly bound nuclei) have excitation energies above the threshold and, at the same time, localized wave functions.\nThis inconsistency precludes by construction any possibility to describe decay widths of excited states, and moreover,\nintroduces an unphysical cut-off in the physically important low-energy phase space.\nImprovements upon this unsatisfactory situation have been proposed and defined since many years, see, e.g.,\nRef. [13], however, only very recently practical applications were realized. The shell model embedded in the continuum\n(SMEC) [14, 15] combines the state-of-the-art shell model methods and interactions with the exact treatment of the\none-body continuum. It means that the standard space of shell-model states of an A-particle system is enlarged by\nthe similar shell-model states of the (A\u22121)-body system coupled with single-particle continuum states. The one-body\ncontinuum is appropriately orthogonalized with respect to the space of bound single-particle states. In the SMEC, the\nbiggest unknown factor is the interaction between the shell-model and continuum states (the simplest contact forces\nhave been used up to now), and this aspect certainly requires further analysis. The known nucleon-nucleus potentials\nmay not be directly applicable, because interactions with all states of an (A\u22121)-body system have, in principle, to be\ntaken into account.\nResults of calculations performed for the p+16 O reactions are presented in Fig. 1. The obtained quality of description\nis indeed very satisfactory. One is able to correctly reproduce the total and differential cross-sections as well as the\nwidths of low-excited unbound states. The model may fail in predicting the widths of states for which the two- or\nthree-body continuum becomes available, and the inclusion of these channels is probably one of the most challenging\nfuture extensions of the model.\n\nTWO-PROTON DECAY\nA search for the two-proton ground-state radioactivity has a long history, however, apart from the well-known threebody (\u03b1pp) decay of 6 Be, such decay mode has not yet been experimentally discovered. One hopes that simultaneous\nemission of two protons may give us invaluable information about the two-particle ground-state correlations in nuclei.\nSuch an emission explores a different phase space than the standard two-particle transfer experiments which were\nused to study pairing correlations in nuclei. Indeed, in the emission process the two-protons may leave the nucleus\n\n\f0.01\n\n5/2\n\n0.008\n\n\u2013 20\n\n+\n\n+\n\n\u2013\n\n10\n\n1/2\n\n1/2\n\n\u2013 40\n0\n\n0.006\n\n\u2013 60\n0.004\n\n1/2\n\n0.008\n\nPhase shift \u03b4 [deg]\n\n0\n\nSp, \u03b3 [MeV*b]\n\n\u2013 10\n\n\u2013 80\n\n0.002\n+\n\n0.006\n0.004\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n50\n\n50\n\n0\n\ntotal\n\n0.008\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n\u2013\n\n3/2\n\n+\n\n3/2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u2013 50\n\n0.002\n\n2\n\n\u2013 50\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n2\n\n3\n\n10\n+\n\n5\n\n5/2\n\n0.006\n\n\u2013\n\n7/2\n\n0\n0\n\n0.004\n\n\u2013 10\n\n0.002\n\n\u20135\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nECM [MeV]\n\n3\n\n\u2013 20\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n2\n\n3\n\nEp [MeV]\n\nFIGURE 1.

Therefore, one has to look for nuclei in which one-proton decay is energetically impossible (which limits\nthe selection to even-Z elements), and where the two-proton decay energy is sufficiently large. During the emission\nprocess, the two protons must tunnel through a wide Coulomb barrier, typically traversing the classically forbidden\nregion of even up to about 100 fm. Hence, the emission probability very strongly depends on the available Q2p value.\nFor small Q2p values, \u03b2 decay is more probable, while for the large ones the life time of the given nucleus is very\nshort. Therefore, the window of opportunity to observe the two-proton decay is fairly small. Nevertheless, several\ncandidate nuclei were already identified (19 Mg, 42 Cr, 45 Fe, 48,49 Ni,. . . ), and intense searches of this new decay mode\nare presently conducted, see e.g. Ref. [16].\nTwo-proton emissions from excited states was already observed in different configurations, such as the decays of\nanalog states, e.g. from 31 Cl (see Ref. [17] and references cited therein), or resonances, see Ref. [18] where the decay\nof 18 Ne was studied. All these experiments encounter difficulties in extracting information about the decay process\nfrom observed data. Indeed, in order to differentiate between various two-proton decay scenarios one has to perform\nthe full three-body calculations, where the two protons and the daughter nucleus are allowed to develop arbitrary\ncorrelations, and the full three-body wave function is obtained. The simple diproton emission can be calculated very\neasily within the WKB approximation (see Ref. [19] and references to earlier papers cited therein). However, the threebody calculations with Coulomb interaction are much more difficult, and have become available only very recently\n[20, 21].\nSuch calculations reproduce the experimental width of the 6 Be decay very well. Examples of results obtained for\n19\nMg and 48 Ni are shown in the left panel of Fig. 2 [20]. It can be seen that the widths based on the diproton hypothesis\nand those obtained by assuming a direct decay to continuum from the l=0 state are very similar. The later widths\nstrongly depend on l, and are much smaller for values corresponding to relevant shell-model orbitals occupied at a\ngiven number of protons. Results obtained by the full three-body calculations are by about three orders of magnitude\nsmaller than those obtained for the l=0 diproton emission. This shows that the final-state proton-proton interaction\nis not sufficient to maintain this pair of particles in a correlated state during the emission process. Since the full\nthree-body wave function of the complete system is obtained, one can determine and compare with experiment not\nonly the life time, but also all relevant correlation observables, e.g., the relative angles and energy correlations. This is\ncrucial for the attempts to determine initial-state correlations from experiment. However, reliable conclusions about the\nproton-proton ground-state correlations can be obtained only from calculations that release the assumption of the inert\n\n\fQp=1.25 MeV\n\nQp=1.19 MeV\n0\n\n1x10\n\n-8\n\nWidth (MeV)\n\n1x10\n\n1x10\n\n-12\n\n1x10\n\n-16\n\n1x10\n\n-20\n\n1x10\n\n-24\n\n1x10\n\n-28\n\n1x10\n\nMg\n\n48\n\nNi\n\nDiproton\nTwo-proton l = 0\nThree-body\nTwo-proton l = lSM\n\n1x10\n\n-19\n\n1x10\n\n-16\n\n1x10\n\n-13\n\n1x10\n\n-10\n\n1x10\n\n-7\n\n1x10\n\n-4\n\n1x10\n\n-1\n\n1x10\n\n2\n\n1x10\n\n5\n\n1x10\n\n8\n\n10-2\n\n4 ms\n10-3\n\nT1/2 (s)\n\n19\n-4\n\nt1/2 (s)\n\n1x10\n\n10-4\n\n10-5\n\n8 \u03bcs\n1/2+[411]\n5/2+[413]\n5/2- [532]\n7/2- [523]\n\n10-6\n\n-32\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n141Ho\n\nE (MeV)\n0.26\n\n0.28\n\n0.30\n\n\u03b22\n\n0.26\n\n0.28\n\n0.30\n\nFIGURE 2.

[20, 21]\nis complementary to that developed in the SMEC model discussed in the previous section. The former one treats the\ntwo-body continuum exactly but assumes an inert core, while the latter one neglects two-body continuum but uses the\nfull shell-model space for the core. Clearly, a combined approach is very much called for.\n\nDEFORMED PROTON EMITTERS\nA large number of odd-Z elements has isotopes that are sufficiently proton-rich to be unbound with respect to the\nground-state proton emission. To date, about 40 such proton emitters are experimentally known [23, 24]. Proton\nemission from spherical nuclei is well understood in terms of the simplest WKB barrier penetration. Such an approach\nallows for a consistent identification of the single-particle orbit from which the emission occurs, because the barrier is\nstrongly influenced by the centrifugal component on top of the standard Coulomb barrier. The success is undoubtedly\ndue to the fact that no pre-formation factor has to be here taken into account, contrary to the physical situation\npertaining to the \u03b1-particle emission. The precision of the theoretical description allows to determine the proton\nspectroscopic factors by comparing the calculated and measured proton-decay life times, see Refs. [25, 26] and\nreferences cited therein.\nRecently, the focus of studying proton emitters, both in experiment and in theory, is on investigating such a process\nwhen it occurs from deformed nuclei. Here, one has to reconcile the picture of the barrier penetration, pertaining\nto the intrinsic frame (and the barrier height depending on the direction with respect to the shape principal axis),\nwith the necessity of correctly describing the angular momentum content of orbitals, which defines the corresponding\ncentrifugal barrier. In recent years, a number of theoretical tools have been developed by several groups in order to\ntackle the problem, and again it seems that the theoretical description gives the full account of experimental data. The\nmethod of choice here is the coupled-channel approach that takes into account the structure of collective states in the\ndaughter nucleus [27, 28, 29] (the so-called non-adiabatic approach). Within the strong-coupling adiabatic approach\nthe calculations were also performed by using the deformed resonance states [30, 31], Green function methods [32],\n\n\freaction theory [33], and time-dependent transmission calculations [34].\nThe challenge of achieving the best possible description of deformed proton emitters lies in a possibility of\ndetermining with a large precision the Nilsson quantum numbers of deformed single-particle states in nuclei which\ncannot be accessed by other spectroscopic methods. An example of such analysis is shown in the right panel of Fig. 2\n[22]. Measured life times of protons emitted from the ground and isomeric states [22, 35] provide a stringent test on\nthe type of single-particle deformed orbitals occupied in 141 Ho. Although the branching ratios to excited states in the\ndaughter nucleus 140 Dy are not yet known, the yrast cascade up to 8+ was recently identified in this nucleus from a\ndecay of a 20 \u03bcs isomer [36]. On the other hand, the fine structure was already observed in the proton decay of 131 Eu\nto the 0+ and 2+ states in 130 Sm, which allowed for an unambiguous determination of the corresponding Nilsson\norbital in 131 Eu [37, 38, 27]. Similar methods were also used for a study of odd-N proton emitting nuclei [39], where,\nin principle, the proton-neutron interaction effects could be studied. A possibility to perform a much more difficult\nexperiment on the proton emission from oriented nuclei was discussed in Ref. [40].\n\nHALOS IN HEAVY NUCLEI\nA fascinating phenomenon of increased radial sizes of nuclei far from stability [41, 42, 43, 44] was very intensely\nstudied in recent years. In extreme situations, when nuclei consist of about thrice more neutrons than protons,\nthe outer weakly bound neutrons may form halos of particle densities extending to rather large distances. For\nexample, the flag-ship nucleus 11 Li exhibiting this kind of structure has the measured [45] root-mean-square (rms)\nradius of Rrms =3.27(24) fm, while in 9 Li one has Rrms =2.43(2) fm. Supposing that in 11 Li the size of the \"core\"\nsubsystem\nof 9 particles is the same as that of 9 Li, one obtains the rms radius of the two-neutron subsystem equal\np\nto (11 \u2217 3.272 \u2212 9 \u2217 2.432)/2=5.67 fm. Therefore, the outer two-neutrons occupy a volume that has the size similar\nto that of 208 Pb, which is a nucleus with about 20 times more particles!\nSizes of several light neutron-rich nuclei were recently measured via the total interaction cross sections, see\nRefs. [46, 47, 48]. Although such measurements rely on a number of theoretical assumptions pertaining to the reaction\nmechanism, the increase of size of nuclei near the drip lines seems to be fairly well established. The question\nof increased sizes of medium heavy and heavy neutron-rich nuclei could be so far addressed only in theoretical\ncalculations within mean-field models. The decisive role played by pairing correlations in establishing asymptotic\ndensity distributions has been recognized since a long time [49, 50], and several calculations based on the Bogoliubov\napproach were already performed, both in the non-relativistic [51, 52, 53] and in the relativistic [54, 55, 56, 57]\nframework.\nThe neutron rms radius constitutes only an indicative general measure of the neutron density distribution. In fact,\nthree different physical properties of the density distribution can be singled out that strongly influence the rms radius,\nnamely, (i) the global size of the nucleus, (ii) the surface diffuseness, and (iii) the rate of decrease of density in the\nasymptotic region. These three properties are almost directly related to (i) the number of nucleons, (ii) the surface\ntension or surface interaction terms, and (iii) the particle binding energy or the Fermi energy, respectively. The halo\nphenomena are obviously related to properties of particle distributions in the asymptotic region. One should keep in\nmind, however, that we cannot expect nuclear halos to correspond to what one might infer from the every-day-life\nmeaning of the term. The nuclear density distributions always decrease when the distance from the center of nucleus\nincreases, and by the halo we can only mean an unusually slow rate of such a decrease.\nIn order to disentangle the three effects mentioned above, one has to use a sufficiently rich model of the neutron\ndistribution. For example, the density distributions obtained by filling with particles the harmonic-oscillator (HO)\npotential up to a given principal HO number cannot serve this purpose, because they are determined by a single\nparameter, the HO frequency h\u0304\u03c90 . Therefore, neither the surface diffuseness nor the asymptotic decrease rate can be\nproperly described, even if h\u0304\u03c90 is adjusted to reproduce the overall size of the nucleus. Similarly, the Fermi (or the\nWoods-Saxon) type of shape,\n\u03c1(r) =\n\n\u03c10\n1 + exp[(r \u2212 R0 )/a]\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\ncan reproduce the overall size and surface diffuseness by an adjustment of parameters R0 and a, respectively. (See\nRef. [58] for a recent application of this form to an analysis of experimental data.) However, here the asymptotic\nbehavior, \u03c1(r)\u2243\u03c10 exp{\u2212r/a}, is dictated by the surface diffuseness a, and not by the Fermi energy. In order to\ndescribe this latter physical feature, that is crucially important in weakly bound systems, even more a complicated\n\n\fmodel distributions must be used. For example, the third parameter can be introduced in a very simple way by rising\nthe denominator in Eq. (1) to some power \u03b3. In this case, the surface diffuseness and asymptotic decrease rate can be\nindependently adjusted by varying a and \u03b3. Another parameterization achieving similar goal was recently analyzed in\nRef. [59].\nDensity distributions obtained within microscopic self-consistent approaches are obviously able to independently\nmodel all three physical effects described above. Here, the quantitative reproduction of the nuclear size, surface\ndiffuseness, and asymptotic decrease rate depends on properties of the underlying interactions, while the density\ndistributions may in principle assume unrestricted forms. By employing the classic Helm model distributions [60,\n61, 62], a method to analyze microscopic distributions was recently devised [53]. A comparison of Fourier transforms\n(form factors) of the Helm and microscopic densities allows to define the diffraction radius R0 and the surface thickness\n\u03c3 from the positions of the first zero and first maximum of the form factor, respectively. These characteristics of the\ndensity are entirely independent of the asymptotic decrease rate, and hence they define a suitable Helm rms reference\nradius,\nr\n\u0001\n3 2\n(H)\nRrms =\n(2)\nR0 + 5\u03c32 .\n5\nAn increase of the rms radius with respect to the Helm rms reference radius can now be used as a signal\nq for the\nappearance of the halo structure, and hence the size of the halo was in [53] defined as the difference \u03b4Rhalo =\n\n5\n3 (Rrms \u2212\n\n(H)\n\nRrms ). Such a halo parameter allows us to discuss and compare the results obtained within different models, and puts\na definition of the halo phenomenon on quantitative grounds.\nIn Ref. [53] it was shown that in the mean-field description of medium heavy and heavy nuclei, the neutron halos\nappear gradually when the neutron numbers increase beyond the neutron magic numbers. The halos of different sizes\ncan be obtained by changing the parameterizations of nuclear effective interactions, and in particular those of the\npairing force [63]. Results of calculations presented in the left panel of Fig. 3 indicate that the sizes of halos at the\ntwo-neutron drip line are of the order of 1 fm throughout the mass table. Fluctuations that are observed in function of\nthe mass number are correlated with the values of the neutron Fermi energy \u03bbn . However, no correlation is observed\nwith the positions of the Fermi energy with respect to the low-l (s and p) single-particle orbitals. This latter fact reflects\nthe so-called pairing anti-halo effect [64].\nIndeed, the pairing correlations strongly modify the asymptotic properties of single-particle densities. In the extreme\nsingle-particle picture,\nq the single-particle l=0 wave functions behave asymptotically as \u03c8(r)\u2243exp(\u2212\u03bar)/r, with the\ndecrease rate of \u03ba= \u22122m\u03b5/h\u03042 given by the single-particle energy \u03b5. Therefore, with \u03b5\u21920, these wave functions\nbecome infinitely flat, and the corresponding rms radii, and the halo sizes, become infinite. Nothing of the sort is\nobserved in the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) calculations, because\nq here the lower components of the quasiparticle\n\nwave functions vanish exponentially with the decrease rate of \u03ba= 2m(E \u2212 \u03bb)/h\u03042 given by the quasiparticle energy E\n[49, 50]. Since the paring correlations do not vanish at drip lines, the nonzero values of E prevent \u03ba from vanishing,\neven in the limit of zero binding given by \u03bb=0. As the result, one of the conditions generally thought to be a prerequisite\nfor the halo structures [65], i.e., the presence of the low-l orbitals, does not apply to paired even-N systems. On the\nother hand, this condition does apply to odd-N systems, because\nthe blocked HFB states correspond to the quasiparticle\nq\nwave functions that vanish with the decrease rate of \u03ba= \u22122m(E + \u03bb)/h\u03042 , which goes to zero at the one-neutron drip\nline given by E + \u03bb=0.\nThe fact that the neutron densities of even-N systems decrease with a non-zero rate when approaching the drip\nline is well born out in all self-consistent Bogoliubov calculations. An example obtained within the relativistic mean\nfield (RMF) approach [54] is shown in the right panel of Fig. 3. Results for all bound even-N sodium isotopes\nwere calculated in space coordinates, and the resulting matter density distributions clearly show a common non-zero\ndecrease rate when approaching the neutron drip line, which simply illustrates the pairing anti-halo effect. This is\nespecially strongly accentuated in the RMF+HB method which gives a cluster of nearly degenerate states close to the\nFermi surface [54], which results in strong pairing correlations near the neutron drip line. Exactly the same situation\noccurs in the zirconium isotopes studied in Ref. [55].\n\n\fFIGURE 3.

In light nuclei, such changes are already observed at\nN=8, 20, and 28 [11]. They are manifested by modifications of nuclear binding energies, that can be interpreted in\nterms of an appearance of new shells (e.g., N=16 [69]), or as an unexpected collectivity observed in semi-magic\nnuclei, e.g., in 32 Mg [70]. In light nuclei, such changes can be attributed to shifts of single-particle levels induced by\nselected channels of the shell-model interactions (see, e.g., Ref. [71]), or to the shape coexistence phenomena related\nto intruder configurations, as studied either in the shell model [7] or in the mean-field approach [72, 73, 74]. Both\ntypes of effects are strongly connected; indeed, smaller shell gaps in nuclei far from stability may facilitate appearance\nof intruder configurations at low energies, or polarization induced by the configuration mixing may decrease the shell\ngaps. Therefore, apart from phenomenological ideas explaining the experimental data, more work is here needed if\none wants to discuss the question of whether the shifted levels or intruder states are primary, secondary, or equivalent\nexplanations of the observed changes.\nIn heavier nuclei, predicted shell modifications can be due to the effects of an increasing surface diffuseness [76],\nchanges in the spin-orbit coupling [77, 78], or influence of pairing correlations [76, 63, 79]. Calculated shell quenching\neffect is illustrated in Fig. 4 for the nuclei along the N=82 isotonic chain. The left panel presents the spherical twoneutron separation energies S2N which show a conspicuous shell gap between the values corresponding to N=80,82\nand N=84,86. When going towards the neutron drip line (i.e., in the direction of decreasing proton number Z), the shell\ngap decreases, and disappears at the two-neutron drip line (i.e., when the values of two-neutron separation energies\n\n\fS\n10\n\nlg\nh el\n\nap\n\nN = 8 0,8 2\nN = 84 ,8 6\n\n0\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nZ\n\n60\n\nShell gap [MeV]\n\n20\n\nS\n\n2N\n\n(M eV )\n\n7\n\nS p h erical\nH F B + S kP\n\n6\n\nFRDM\n\n5\n4 HFBCS-1\nExp.\n\n3\n2\n\nHFB-1\n\n1\n\n70\n\n0\n30\n\nSkP\n40\n\nN =82\n\n\u03b4\u03c1\n\n0\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nZ\n\nFIGURE 4.

The shell quenching effect is a generic result obtained in all self-consistent mean-field calculations based\non effective two-body interactions. However, the exact magnitude of the effect does strongly depend on what kind of\ninteraction is used. In particular, interactions that give a small effective mass tend to overestimate the shell gaps in\nstable nuclei, and hence the shell quenching effects are not strong enough to significantly decrease these gaps near\nthe drip lines. Moreover, the type of the pairing interactions used in these calculations crucially influences the degree\nof the shell quenching [79]. At the moment, our knowledge of the effective interactions is insufficient for reliable\npredictions of the shell quenching far from stability, and the only method to proceed further seems to be the use of\nfuture measurements to fit better interactions.\nThe best to date effective interactions fitted to nuclear masses were obtained in Refs. [9, 75]. Depending on the\nmethod to treat the pairing correlations, BCS [9] or HFB [75], the authors obtained the rms deviations between the\ncalculated and measured binding energies equal to 0.738 and 0.766 MeV, respectively. The quality of the description\nis almost identical to that (0.669 MeV) obtained within the microscopic-macroscopic FRDM method based on a\nphenomenological mean-field potential [80]. Needless to say that masses of unknown nuclei, which are obtained by\nextrapolating either effective interactions or phenomenological mean-fields, are markedly different. This is illustrated\nin the right panel of Fig. 4, which shows the shell gaps at N=82 defined by S2N (N=82)\u2212S2N (N=84). Interactions that\nwere fitted to masses give a weak shell quenching as compared the that obtained for the SkP interaction [50], while\nthe FRDM results show no quenching at all. Obviously, there is still a fair degree of arbitrariness in the values of\nparameters of the effective interactions, and at the moment it is not clear how well these parameters are fixed by fits to\nmasses or other nuclear properties.\nCalculations of Refs. [9, 75] were performed by expanding the single-particle wave functions in the harmonicoscillator (HO) eigenstates, and therefore, they are characterized by unphysical asymptotic properties of the particle\nand pairing density distributions. It is known [81] that the convergence of results in function of the HO basis size\ncan be extremely slow, and the stability of results tested by increasing the basis by adding one or two HO shells can\nbe misleading. Moreover, the asymptotic properties of densities are essential for a correct description of the pairing\nchannel [51]. It still remains to be investigated to which extend these deficiencies of the method are important for\ndetermining masses of weakly bound nuclei. This question can be studied by using methods based on the transformed\nharmonic oscillator (THO) basis [82, 83, 84] in which the correct asymptotic behavior is obtained by a proper pointlike transformation of the basis wave functions.\nPreliminary results obtained within such an approach are shown in Fig. 5 [79]. Deformed calculations were\nperformed for a standard Skyrme effective interaction SLy4 [85], and for contact pairing interaction that is intermediate\nbetween the volume and surface force [86]. The figure shows the two-neutron separation energies calculated for all\neven-even nuclei that are bound with respect to two-particle emission, i.e., those that have negative neutron and\nproton HFB Fermi energies. The results show a very interesting phenomenon occurring at the neutron drip line,\nnamely, negative two-neutron separation energies are sometimes obtained for particle-stable nuclei. This apparently\ncontradictory result illustrates the fact that the HFB particle stability is defined with respect to a fixed configuration,\nwhile the two-neutron separation energies can involve binding energies of neighboring nuclei that may have different\nconfigurations, e.g., different shapes. Hence, at the neutron drip line we may encounter nuclei for which the two-\n\n\fFIGURE 5.

[79].\n\nneutron emission is energetically possible, but can be hindered by different configurations of the parent and daughter\nnuclei.\n\nNEUTRON-PROTON PAIRING COLLECTIVITY\nSubject of the neutron-proton (np) pairing in nuclei has been studied since the early sixties, however, recently it\nwitnessed an impressive renewal of interest which was due to increased experimental possibilities of studying medium\nheavy N\u2248Z nuclei. High-spin aspects of the np pairing are discussed in Ref. [10], therefore, here we concentrate on\nthe question of collective ground-state correlations of this type. Despite the long history, the subject is plagued with\ncontradicting opinions and results, and very often even the definitions of basic quantities are under debate. Without\nattempting a review of the whole issue, let us present here several important recent steps in this domain.\nQuestion of the np pairing is very often discussed in connection to the so-called Wigner energy term in the mass\nformula, see Ref. [87] and references cited therein. Such a term represents an additional binding of N\u2248Z nuclei with\nrespect to a smooth-reference dependence on N and Z. The same additional binding is observed when the experimental\nmasses are compared to mean-field mass predictions. It turns out that both, smooth part of experimental masses\nand mean-field masses, are in a perfect agreement with one another, and can be described by a term proportional\nto (N\u2212Z)2 =4Tz2 =4T 2 , where Tz and T are the ground-state values of the projection on the third axis and total\nisospin, respectively. On the other hand, the additional binding (the Wigner energy) is a function of |N\u2212Z|=2|Tz |=2T ,\nand therefore has a cusp at N=Z. Moreover, when added together both contributions to the binding energy give\napproximately a term proportional to T (T +1), i.e., the numerical coefficients in front of the smooth term proportional\nto T 2 , and the cusp proportional to T , are almost equal.\nThis simple observation has been known since many years [88], and recently was reanalyzed in Refs. [89, 90]. A\ncontroversy, however, arises at the level of interpretation of this result, namely, the authors of Refs. [89, 90] consider\nthe T (T +1) term as a simple symmetry energy that has nothing to do with pairing correlations, and hence claim\nthat there is no experimental indication for the collective np pairing in nuclei. On the other hand, the authors of\nRefs. [87, 91] consider the mean-field term T 2 as representing the symmetry energy, and attribute the remaining\ncontribution (proportional to T ) to the T =0 np pairing correlations.\nThe dispute, however, is far from being an academic discussion triggered by a misunderstanding of definitions.\nIndeed, what is usually meant by correlations is the question whether an experiment that probes for a simultaneous\npresence of a neutron and a proton gives the probability higher or not than the product of probabilities to find a neutron\nand a proton in two independent experiments. Since the mean-field approximation gives by definition no correlations\n(in the sense of the above definition) it is reasonable to attribute all the effects, or contributions to energy, that are\nbeyond the mean-field approximation, to correlations.\n\n\f\u2206(7 \u0015 >0H9@\n\n\u0015\u0013\n\n\u0013\u0011\u0019\n\u0016\u0013\n\n\u0014\u0018\n\n\u0003\n\n\u0017\u0013\n\n$\n\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u0019\n\n\u0017\n\nE\n\n\u0013 \u0015\u0013\n\n\u0013\u000e\n\n\u0017\u0010\n\u0015\u000e\n\n\u0015\u000e\n\n\u000e\n\u0017\u000e \u0015\n\nH[S\u0011\nWK\u001d\u0003\u03b2\n\u03b2\u0015 \u0013\u0011\u0013\u0018\n\n\u0018\n\n\u0014\u0013\n\n\u0015\u0013\n\n\u0015\u001b\n\n\u0016\u0019\n\n\u0017\u0017\n\n\u0018\u0015 $\n\nLQ\nJ\n\n\u0013\u0011\u0018\n\nYDFXXP\n\nQN\n\n\u0015TS\n\nFU\nD\n\n>0H9@\n\u0014\u000e\n\n\u0013\u0003\u0003\n\n\u001c\n\n7 \u0014\n\n\u0014\u0011\u0013\n\n7\n\n*7 \u0014\n\n\u0003\u0010\u0003\u2206\n\u2206(\n\n*7 \u0013\n\n\u0017\u000e \u0016\u000e\n\n\u0014\u0013\n\n7\n\nD\n\u0014\u0011\u0017\n\n\u0018\n\n7 \u0013\n\n\u2206(\n\n\u0014\u0011\u0013\n\u0013\u0011\u0018\n\n1 =\u0003HYHQ\u0010HYHQ\u0003QXFOHL\u001d\u00037 \u0014\u0003VWDWHV\n\n\u0014\u0014 \u0015\u000e\n\n\u0013\u0011\u0013\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0014\u0015\n\n\u0014\u0011\u0018\n\n\u2206(7 \u0014\u0003>0H9@\n\n: $ \u0003>0H9@\n\n\u0017\u001a\u0012$\u0003>0H9@\n\n\u0015\u0011\u0013\n\n\u0010\u0013\u0011\u0018\n\nH[S\nWK\n\n\u0015\u0013 \u0016\u0013 \u0017\u0013 \u0018\u0013 \u0019\u0013 \u001a\u0013\n\n$\n\u0016\u0013\n\n\u0017\u0013\n\n\u0018\u0013 $\n\nFIGURE 6. The Wigner energy (left top panel) and pairing coupling constants (left middle panel) together with the T =0, 1, and\n2 excitation energies in N=Z even-even and odd-odd nuclei. In the left bottom panel, experimental data (stars) are compared with\nthe results of calculation with (full symbols) and without (open symbols) the T =0 np interaction included. From Ref. [92]\n\nAs was proved in Ref. [87], the full shell-model calculations in the sd and f p shells give the binding energies\nroughly proportional to T (T +1), and hence they perfectly reproduce the Wigner energy. This result is, of course, not\na trivial result of the isospin invariance of the interaction. Indeed, the isospin invariance requires that energies are\nfunctions of the total isospin T , and not necessarily functions of the quadratic invariant T (T +1). [Similarly, not all\nrotationally-invariant Hamiltonians give rotational spectra proportional to J(J+1).] The fact that the nuclear binding\nenergies do behave as T (T +1) is a non-trivial result of a specific structure of the nuclear (shell-model) interaction.\nIn Ref. [87], it was also shown that the Wigner term disappears when all T =0 matrix elements are removed from the\nHamiltonian. However, this observation does not constitute a proof that the T =0 pairing correlations are at the origin\nof the Wigner term. The shell-model calculations take into account all sorts of correlations, and it is rather difficult to\ndisentangle and quantify the np pairing correlations in the final result. On the other hand, an approach that starts from\nthe mean-field approximation and than adds correlations on top of it, is tailored towards such a quantification.\nThe first consistent description of several experimental facts observed in N\u2248Z nuclei was recently obtained [92]\nwithin the mean-field plus pairing approach. The authors were able to include all pairing channels simultaneously on\ntop of the standard mean-filed solutions, and showed that the T =0 np pairing is essential to obtain agreement with\nseveral types of observables. Their results are summarized in Fig. 6. After an adjustment of the T =0 pairing coupling\nconstant to the Wigner energy term (top left panel) they can reproduce (without any additional fitted parameters),\n(i) the T =2 states in even-even N=Z nuclei (bottom left panel), (ii) the T =1 states in even-even N=Z nuclei (middle\npanel), and (iii) the T =1 and T =0 states in odd-odd N=Z nuclei (right panel). There are two key elements of their\ndescription, namely, the idea of the iso-cranking, i.e., a consistent application of the broken-symmetry treatment of\nnuclear excitations to the isospin channel, and (ii) identification of two-quasiparticle excitations among states of a\ngiven isospin, that is based on analyzing their time-reversal and iso-signature properties. Although these results are\nnot a direct proof of existence of the collective np pairing correlations in nuclei, they are the best circumstantial\nevidence thereof, that is available to date.\n\nMAGNETIC ROTATION\nContrary to the standard image of nuclear rotation, where a deformed charge distribution rotates in the laboratory\nframe, a new type of rotational bands was recently discovered and interpreted as rotations of deformed distributions\nof currents, see reviews in Refs. [93, 94]. Net non-zero distributions of currents may occur in nuclei whenever proton\nand neutron angular momenta are misaligned at zero angular frequency, and then align when the angular frequency\nincreases. This leads to a new way to build up high values of angular momenta, called the shears mechanism, in which\nthe proton and neutron angular momenta align along a common axis. When the difference of proton and neutron\nangular momentum decreases, so decreases the magnetic moment, as illustrated in the right panel of Fig. 7, and hence\n\n\f\u03bc\u22a5\nj\u03c0\n\nj\u03bd\n\nFIGURE 7. Schematic illustration of the shears mechanism in nuclei (right panel) together with the TAC (middle panel, From\nRef. [95]) and RMF (left panel, From Ref. [96]) description of the magnetic band in 84 Rb.\n\nthe reduced magnetic dipole transition probabilities decrease with increasing angular momentum. During the whole\nalignment process the total angular momentum axis is tilted with respect to principal axes of the charge distribution,\nand hence the signature symmetry must be broken in the intrinsic frame of reference.\nThe shears bands, or the magnetic rotation phenomena, have already been discovered in several regions of nuclei,\nsee, e.g., recent studies around A\u224380 [95], A\u2243110 [97], A\u2243140 [98, 99], and A\u2243200 [100, 101, 102]. Most of such\nstructures were found in light lead isotopes, but in principle, they can occur in any nucleus with the shell structure\nbased on high- j proton (neutron) holes coupled to high- j neutron (proton) particles [93].\nUp to now, the shears bands identified in the experiment were almost uniquely interpreted within the tilted-axis\ncranking (TAC) model proposed and developed by Stefan Frauendorf, see Ref. [103] and references cited therein. The\nmodel uses the standard phenomenological mean-field potential with pairing correlations, and correctly reproduces\nthe main feature of the shears bands, namely, the decrease of B(M1) with spin, see the example for 84 Rb shown in the\nmiddle panel of Fig. 7. The only available self-consistent calculations of the shears mechanism were performed within\nthe RMF approach [96], see the left panel of Fig. 7, and within the Skyrme-HF approach [104]. A more extensive\nself-consistent studies are required to elucidate the delicate balance between the standard (rotating charge) and new\n(rotating current) mechanisms of collective bands in weakly deformed nuclei. Moreover, only such studies can give us\naccess to isovector time-odd terms in the rotating mean fields, which are neglected in the phenomenological mean-field\npotentials.\n\nPSEUDOSPIN SYMMETRY\nThe pseudospin symmetry has been introduced in nuclear structure physics many years ago [105, 106], in order to\naccount for \"unexpected\" degeneracies in single-particle spectra. It has been attributed to an accidental cancelation\nbetween the spin-orbit field ~l *~s and the ~l2 term in the Nilsson potential [107], the latter reflecting the fact that the\nnuclear single-particle field has a flat bottom due to the saturation of nuclear forces. Later, many similar degeneracies\nwere also observed among rotational bands, see, e.g., the pair of bands in 187 Os studied in Ref. [108] and references\ncited therein.\nRecently, a very elegant and natural explanation was suggested [109, 110, 111], which is based on simple relativistic\narguments and properties of the RMF Dirac equation for nucleons. Indeed, when the Dirac Hamiltonian is solved with\nthe vector and scalar potentials, VV and VS , respectively,\nH = ~\u03b1 * ~p + \u03b2(M + VS ) + VV ,\n\n(3)\n\nand when VV +VS =const, solutions can be classified according to a new SU(2) group, called the pseudospin group\n \u0303 ~j-~s\u0303 is also conserved, and the lowergenerated by ~s\u0303=U p~sU p for U p =2(~s * ~p)/p. Then, the pseudo-orbital symmetry ~l=\ncomponent radial wave functions of the pseudospin partner states are identical to one another.\nIn finite nuclei, condition VV +VS =const is, of course, violated because the potentials have finite range, and hence,\nthey must depend on the distance from the center of the nucleus. However, it turns out that in realistic situations\n\n\fFIGURE 8. Upper (left panel) and lower (right panel) components of the Dirac wave functions for the 2s1/2 and 1d3/2 states in\n208 Pb. (From Ref. [112]. Reprinted from Nuclear Physics A, Vol 690, 2001, pp 41-51, J.N. Ginocchio, \"A relativistic symmetry in\nnuclei: its. . . \", Copyright (2001), with permission from Elsevier Science.)\n\nthe lower Dirac components of the pseudospin partners are still fairly close to one another, and their single-particle\nenergies are almost degenerate. This is illustrated in Fig. 8 [112], where the upper (left panel) and lower (right panel)\ncomponents of two bound states, 2s1/2 and 1d3/2, in 208 Pb are plotted. These two states are the p\u0303 pseudospin partners\n \u0303 i.e., to the 1 p\u03031/2 and 1 p\u03033/2 orbitals, and their lower Dirac components are very similar indeed.\ncorresponding to l=1,\nNevertheless, the utility of the idea of the pseudospin symmetry crucially depends on the symmetry breaking\nschemes in real nuclei, and this aspect of the proposed relativistic explanation requires further study, see the analyses\npresented in Refs. [113, 114] and references cited therein. In particular, an explanation of the fact that the pseudospin\nsymmetry does not hold in light nuclei is still lacking (relativity arguments should hold irrespective of the number of\nparticles). Similarly, it would be very interesting to see if the pseudospin symmetry still holds in neutron rich nuclei,\nwhere changes in the surface diffuseness may act against it [76].\n\nSHELL EFFECTS IN STRONG COULOMB FIELDS\nRecent experimental discoveries and searches for new superheavy elements, see recent reviews in Refs. [115, 116],\nhave triggered a substantial increase in the theoretical efforts to describe the structure and production of such systems,\nsee recent Refs. [117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122] and [123, 124, 125, 126, 127], respectively. Although many nuclides in\nthe uncharted region of Z>112-114 are predicted to have substantial barriers against fission, they can be experimentally\nproduced only with extremely low cross-sections. Stability and existence of superheavy nuclei are entirely due to the\nshell effects, and hence a delicate balance between extremely strong Coulomb field and nuclear mean-field potential\nmust be self-consistently taken into account [128].\nDue to the large numbers of protons and neutrons, densities of single-particle states in superheavy and hyperheavy\nnuclei are much larger than those in usual stable nuclei [121]. Hence, the magic shell gaps are significantly smaller,\nand the corresponding shell corrections shown in Fig. 9 are not-so-well localized around the doubly-magic nuclei. This\nobservation [121] decreases the importance of predicting which is the next proton magic number after Z=82 [119].\nIndeed, we may expect a fairly wide island of superheavy nuclei with tangible life times, and not a single or several\nlong-living superheavy nuclides. However, precise estimates of life times require a better determination of nuclear\neffective forces and reaction mechanisms, when they are used for extrapolations to very exotic systems.\n\nPERSPECTIVES AND OUTLOOK\nFocus of the present-day nuclear structure theory is on determination of nuclear effective interactions and/or energy\ndensity functionals. The term \"effective\" pertains here to the fact that they are used in a restricted phase space (shell\nmodel) or neglect correlations (mean field), and hence cannot be identical to interactions in the vacuum. Both types\n\n\fFIGURE 9. Shell corrections calculated from spherical self-consistent single-particle spectra for even-even nuclei around Z=120\nand N=180. (From Ref. [121]. Reprinted from Physics Letters B, Vol 515, 2001, Page 42, M. Bender et al, \"Shell stabilization of\nsuper- and hyperheavy nuclei without magic gaps\", Copyright (2001), with permission from Elsevier Science.)\n\nof methods are at present very well developed and operational, however, much more work is needed to find the best\npossible interactions to be used within them.\nFirst-principle derivations of effective interactions are currently pursued with increased intensity, however, the\ntask is difficult and requires some time to bear fruit. In the past such derivations were always complemented by\nphenomenological adjustment to experimental data. There is no doubt that such adjustments will remain the best source\nof recognizing the main features of interactions, and achieving a precise description. Therefore, future developments\nin nuclear structure theory critically depend on the availability of data that probe and enhance the most interesting\nand least known channels of effective interactions. The isospin properties are certainly of that kind, and we hope to\nget qualitatively new insight in this channel from the new generation rare-isotope facilities that are currently being\nconstructed or planned throughout the world.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nDuring preparation of this talk I have received suggestions and comments from over 40 of my colleagues and\ncollaborators; I would like to thank them very much for their help.
