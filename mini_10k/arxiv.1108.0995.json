It was estimated that Advanced LIGO can see 3-30 such events per year out to distances of several hundred\nMpc[1]. Due to a small mass ratio of IMRIs (\u03bc/M \u223c 10\u22122 \u2212 10\u22123 ), the small body lingers in the large black holes\nstrong-curvature region for about hundreds wave cycles before merger, and then produce a good signal-to-noise ratio.\nConsidering the waveform-match technology of LIGO's data analysis, ones should first model enough accurate and\nnumerous waveform templates for IMRI sources.\nThe post-Newtonian approximation has completely broken down in this high relativistic regime. Up to now,\nnumerical relativity still encounters some difficulties to simulate the binary black hole systems when the mass ratio\nbecomes small. The newest result achieves the mass ratio 0.01 (without spin) only with two orbit's evolution[2].\nFor extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), the mass ratio about 10\u22124 \u2212 10\u22127 , the small objects can be treated as a\nsmall perturbation to the large black holes gravitational field and can be modeled by black-hole perturbation theory\nbuilt by Regge, Wheeler and Zerilli in Schwarzschild spacetime[3, 4] and by Teukolsky in Kerr background[5, 6]. For\nexample, a successful approach is that the orbit of small body is just geodesics of test particle in the background of\ncentral black hole, and the spiral of small object is simulated as a sequence of adiabatically shrinking geodesics by\nchanging the constants of motion due to gravitational radiation[7\u201316]. But, when mass ratio increases, for IMRIs, the\nsmall object cannot be treated as test particle and the self-gravitational potential of small body becomes considerable.\nAnd perhaps the linear perturbation approximation is not valid in this case.\nIn last decade, using effective one-body (EOB) resummed analytical formalism [17\u201323] to develop accurate analytical\nmodels of dynamics and waveforms of black hole binaries has gotten some exciting results[24\u201332]. Recently, some\nresearches used EOB to model the dynamical evolution of IMRIs and extract waveforms via a multipolar ReggerWheeler-Zerilli type perturbation approach[33\u201335]. And an effort of constructing the EOB waveform models for\nEMRIs by calibration of several high-order post-Newtonian parameters was also presented [36, 37].\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: wenbiao@icra.it\naddress: zjcao@amt.ac.cn\n\n\f2\nThe framework of effective one-body has two building blocks which are dynamics and the corresponding waveform.\nBut the dynamics essentially affects the resulted gravitational waveform for binary compact star system. This dynamics includes two parts. One is the conservative part which comes from effective one-body reduction. The other\npart is the gravitational back reaction which contributes to the shrinking process of the inspiral of binary compact\nstar system. Previous works used analytical waveform to construct this back reaction term. Since the analytical form\nis based on some assumptions, the consistency of this term is always checked by numerical energy flux. Differently\nwe directly use numerical energy flux to construct this back reaction term in this work.\nConsidering that the perturbation method works well for intermediate mass ratio binaries[38, 39], in this paper,\nwe model the gravitational wave sources of IMRIs by combining the EOB frame with the Teukolsky perturbationbased energy fluxes. Thanks to the EOB theory, we treat the binary system by an effective particle mass \u03bc =\nm1 m2 /(m1 + m2 ) and a deformed Kerr (or Schwarzschild if without spin) spacetime with mass M = m1 + m2 where\nm1 is the mass of massive black holes and m2 the mass of small body. The gravitational energy fluxes and waveforms\nare calculated by solving the Teukolsky equation in frequency domain not by the EOB fluxes and waveforms, as well\nas the inspiral dynamics is computed not following the adiabatic approximation but by the EOB dynamics which was\ndeveloped in Refs.[33\u201335].\nWe must emphasize here that the scheme we used in this paper is different with the works by Yunes et al. which\nused the Teukolsky fluxes to calibrate EOB waveforms[36, 37], and also different with the references [33\u201335] which use\nperturbation method to read the waveforms but not to radiation reaction. Our calculation covers both quasi-circular\ninspiral and nonadiabatic plunge without merger and ringdown stages. The results in this paper should be important\nfor checking the EOB PN-expanded energy flux. With our method, one can obtain information for IMRIs which is\nnot yet been accessible by full numerical relativity. Moreover, our method may be expanded to elliptic and even\nnon-equatorial orbits. In the future works of this series, we will expand this calculation to solve Teukolsky equation\nin time domain and model the entire process of IMRIs including merger and ringdown.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we introduce EOB Hamiltonian and dynamics briefly. Then\nwe describe our numerical technologies used in solving the Teukolsky equation to obtain fluxes and waveforms. In\nSec. IV we present our calculation results for several IMRI cases. Finally, conclusion and discussion of this work are\ngiven in the last section.\nWe use units G = c = 1 and the metric signature (\u2212, +, +, +). Distance and time are measured by the effective\nKerr black-hole mass M .\nII.\n\nEOB HAMILTON WITH DEFORMED KERR BACKGROUND\n\nThe well-known EOB formalism was first introduced by Buonanno and Damour about ten years ago to model\ncomparable-mass black hole binaries[17, 18], and was also applied in small mass-ratio systems[33\u201335, 40]. Here we\nassume an IMRI system with central Kerr black hole m1 and inspiralling object m2 which is restricted on the equatorial\nplane of m1 , total mass M = m1 + m2 , reduced mass \u03bc = m1 m2 /M and symmetric mass ratio \u03bd = \u03bc/M .

In this paper, we use energy flux calculated by the Teukolsky perturbation theory instead of EOB energy flux\nin Eq.(22).

In the MST method, the homogeneous solutions of Teukolsky equation are expressed in terms of\ntwo kinds of series of special functions.

The hypergeometric function F (\u03b1, \u03b2; \u03b3; x) can be\nfound in mathematic handbooks.\nThe second one consists of series of Coulomb wave functions which is convergent at infinity. The homogeneous\nsolution of Teukolsky equation is\nRC = z \u22121\u2212s (1 \u2212 \u01eb\u03ba/z)\u2212s\u2212i(\u01eb+\u03c4 )/2 f\u03bd (z),\n\n(47)\n\nwhere f\u03bd (z) is expressed in a series of Coulamb wave functions as\nf\u03bd (z) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(\u2212i)n\n\n(\u03bd + 1 + s \u2212 i\u01eb)n\nan Fn+\u03bd (\u2212is \u2212 \u01eb, z),\n(\u03bd + 1 \u2212 s + i\u01eb)n\n\n(48)\n\nand z = \u03c9(r \u2212 r\u2212 ), (a)n = \u0393(a + n)/\u0393(a), FN (\u03b7, z) is a Coulomb wave function. Notice that both Eqs.(46,48) involve\na parameter \u03bd, the so-called renormalized angular momentum.\nThe key part of Fujita and Tagoshi's method is searching the renormalized angular momentum numerically. When\nharmonic frequency \u03c9 is under some critical values, real solutions of \u03bd can be found[45]. If \u03c9 exceeding these critical\nvalues, complex solutions of \u03bd can also be found[46]. But when \u03c9 becomes very large, it becomes very difficult to\nsearch the solution of \u03bd accurately. In this paper, we mainly employ the new method by Fujita and Tagoshi to solve\nthe Teukolsky equation because of its high accuracy and high efficiency, but when \u03c9 becomes large and difficult to\nfind \u03bd accurately, we use the numerical integration method to evaluate the Teukolsky equation.\nFor checking our numerical code's validity, in Table I and Table II, we list our results by two kind of methods and\nthe data published by Ref.[45]. We find our results are almost same with Fujita and Tagoshi's, and the accuracy of\nour numerical integration of the Teukolsky equation is also good.\nIV.\n\nRELATIVISTIC DYNAMICS AND WAVEFORMS\n\nThe mass ratio of IMRI systems we adopted is 0.01, and the central massive body is a Kerr black hole .

This makes it so we can contain\nthe first order conservative self-force of the small body in dynamics. We list our numerical algorithm here for clarity:\n1. We calculate the quasi-circular data for the small body at time-step ti ;\n2. Use the orbital frequency from the step 1 to solve the Teukolsky equation in frequency domain by the numerical\nmethods we introduced in Sec.III up to lmax = 12;\n3. Then get the flux and waveforms (Teukolsky-based) by summing over the multipoles at the time-step ti ;\n4. Calculate the dynamics of the small body for the time-step ti+1 by solving the EOB dynamics equations (19-22);\n5. Iterate from the step 1.\nThe method of modeling back reaction and waveforms based on the Teukolsky equation in frequency domain are\nquite successful in quasi-periodic inspirals of extreme mass-ratio cases. It is a good standard for checking other\nmethods. For example, in Ref.[37], Yunes et al. used the Teukolsky waveforms to construct more accurate EOB\nwaveform models. But while the mass ratio \u03bc/M \u223c 10\u22122 , the precision of Teukolsky energy fluxes and waveforms\nwould decrease because it is first order perturbation theory and also the subleading terms in the mass-ratio introduce\nconservative correction is not included in the Teukolsky equation. It is similar in Refs.[33\u201335] where they calculated\nf\u02c6DIN by the EOB analytical radiation reaction in the \u03bd \u2192 0 limit and gravitational waves by the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli\nperturbation equation. Anyway, there are several reasons drive us choose the Teukolsky-based flux to replace the EOB\nanalytical one to calculate the radiation reaction in this work. One is that our Teukolsky-based flux does not include\nany low velocity approximation comparing with the post-Newtonian expanded EOB flux. But we also notice that\nthe f\u02c6DIN based PN resummed waveform extends effectively the PN waveform beyond the slow velocity approximation\nquite well [52]. One is that the Teukolsky-based flux can be calculated to arbitrary multipole (but actually because\nof a computation limit, we compute to lmax = 12) against the EOB's maximum l = 8 until now. The last one is that\nthe black hole absorbed term is naturally included in the Teukolsky-based energy flux.\nThere is also a problem to evolve the plunge orbit inside the Kerr or Schwarzschild ISCO(innermost stable circular\norbit) with the adiabatic approximation frequency-domain code. The plunge orbit is unstable and do not have a\nwell-defined frequency spectrum. But as same as the EOB-based evolution of plunge orbit, we can just use the EOB\ndynamical equation (20) to define the orbit frequency and calculate the harmonic frequency in Eq.(34). We think this\nis an alternative way to calculate the energy flux in the Teukolsky frequency-domain frame. And the reliability of\nthis definition of orbital frequency was investigated in [35]. The key point is that the orbital evolution in this paper\nis based on the EOB dynamics (19-22) but not the adiabatic approximation.\nFirst, we compare the same situation in Fig.1 of Ref.[33] by our numerical algorithm with the 5PN resummed f\u02c6DIN\nin [34, 35]. For comparison, we take the \u03bd \u2192 0 limit as same as the Eqs.(2-6) of [34]. Our results are showed in\nFigure 1, in which both results are consistently very good at qualitative level. Because of the different methods for\ngetting energy fluxes, our results of orbital dynamics and waveforms are slightly different, with the one by the 5PN\nresummed back reaction at quantitative level. In details, before ISCO, during the inspiral, both results are almost\nthe same, but in plunge phase, a small but visible dephasing (about 0.16 radian) appears. Of course, this dephasing\nshould be larger if involving more orbit evolution.\nFurthermore, to validate our result, we check the \"convergence\" of the l = m = 2 waveform modulus while \u03bd \u2192 0.\nThe result is displayed in Fig. 2 and can clearly dedicate that the waveform we calculated has a good convergence.

We use the full EOB dynamics equations (19-22) without the \u03bd \u2192 0 approximation. This makes us\ncan contain the conservative mass-ratio corrections. When a 6= 0, \u03bd 6= 0, it is no possible to write out an analytical\nexpression for the angular momentum. So we use Brent's algorithm[53] to search Lz numerically with a relative\nerror less than 10\u221213 . For the Kerr black holes, because of the so-called frame-dragging effect, the radius of ISCO is\nsmaller(a > 0) or bigger(a < 0) than the Schwarzschild case. For example, the extreme Kerr black hole, a = \u00b11, the\nISCO locates at r = 1M and r = 9M , respectively. And for a = 0.7, \u2212 0.9, rISCO = 3.39313, 8.71735, respectively.\nFor this reason, when a < 0 (retrograde orbit), the small body plunges faster into the black hole. At the same\ntime, when a > 0 (prograde orbit), the small body spirals more cycles before plunge. These phenomena are clearly\ndisplayed in Fig.3.\nIn addition the waveforms are modified by different values of spin of Kerr black holes. As an example, we show\nthe waveforms of a = \u22120.9, 0.7 cases in Figure 4. After passing the light ring, based on the analysis in Ref.[35], the\nmerge actually has started and gone into ringdown phase, the energy flux and waveform cannot be calculated by the\nfrequency-domain method but can be connected by a quasi-normal mode or time-domain Teukolsky solution.

We have presented our numerical results based on the EOB dynamics and the frequency-domain\nTeukolsky flux in this paper. This is the first try to use the frequecy-domain Teukolsky frame in the plunge phase\nof IMRIs by the help of the EOB dynamics. Our results are consistent to the previous results using the analytical\nenergy fluxes of post-Newtonian approximation.\nAnd the results shown here are reasonable. By comparing with the full EOB evolution in deformed Schwarzschild\nspace-time, a quite good coincidence before ISCO gives a support for applying the Teukolsky equation up to mass-ratio\n0.01. After ISCO, the plunge stage, a small difference comes out due to two different energy fluxes used.\nSince there are few results of post-Newtonian waveforms on elliptic, and even non-equatorial orbits, it's not easy\nto generalize the previous EOB dynamics works to these systems. In principle, our numerical energy-flux method is\nnot restricted by this. The radial and polar frequencies can be obtained by evolving an \"imaginary\" geodesic orbit at\nevery step. The \"imaginary\" geodesic orbit is the solution of Eqs.(19)-(22) but F\u0302 = 0 in (22). This solution involves\n\n\f10\nordinary differential equations with only few variables, so the computation time is negligible compared with the total\nevolution time. Of course, when we try to expand our method to the elliptic, and even non-equatorial orbits, the\nnumerical cost will be more high. However, for EMRIs, there were several works which evolved generic orbits with\nsolving the Teukolsky equation [10, 12, 16, 54]. For IMRIs, we can afford the numerical cost even for evolving a few\ntens of orbits. And more, we can generalize our analysis to generic spinning objects moving along generic elliptic, and\neven non-equatorial orbits. These would be our future works.\nThe adiabatic approximation works well in inspiral with extreme mass-ratio limit, but is violated in plunge stage.\nAt the same time, the EOB dynamics can be used in both inspiral and plunge evolution. And then the energy fluxes\nalso are calculated by the EOB-PN expanded waveforms usually. In this traditional method, the EOB fluxes are based\non the post-Newtonian approximation, and losses accuracy in the high relativistic region. What we do in this paper\nis, in the EOB dynamics frame, use the Teukolsky-based energy fluxes and waveforms to replace the EOB ones. In\nother words, we adopt the frequency-domain Teukolsky-based energy fluxes and waveforms but abandon the adiabatic\napproximation; we employ the EOB dynamics to evolve the binary systems but do not use the EOB energy fluxes for\nback reaction.\nThis EOB plus Teukolsky frame we develop in this work can provide an alternative way to research the gravitational\nwaves from IMRIs. The dynamical evolution and waveforms for several different spinning black holes are given in the\nabove sections. But more detailed analysis about this EOB plus Teukolsky frame should be done farther in future,\nwhen more interesting results can be obtained.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Dr. R. Fujita and Dr. S.
