We also comment on the relationship of the dx2 \u2212y 2 superconducting phase\nof the doped 2D repulsive Hubbard model to a d-wave spin density wave state for the attractive\ncase.\nPACS numbers: 71.10.Fd, 03.75.Ss, 74.25.Ha\n\nUsing standing wave laser light fields and optical Feshbach resonances, ultracold atomic gases can be used to\nrealize a variety of Hubbard like models.1,2 Technically if\none wants a strong interaction, it appears easier to create an ultracold fermi gas (e.g., 6 Li) with an attractive\ninteraction and experiments on polarized fermion gases\nwith attractive interactions have been carried out to look\nfor exotic superfluid states.3,4,5,6\nOne state of particular interest is the FFLO state\nwhich arises from pairing across the spin-split Fermi\nsurface of a spin polarized system.7,8 In this state the\nCooper pairs have a finite center of mass momentum\nleading to spatial oscillations of the pair field order\nparameter and the spin polarization. Here, making\nuse of density-matrix-renormalization-group (DMRG)\nresults9,10 for the doped, positive U Hubbard model and a\nwell-known particle-hole transformation,11,12,13,14 we discuss the properties of the FFLO state for the case of a\nhalf-filled spin polarized negative U Hubbard model on\na two-dimensional lattice. We also comment on the relationship of this to the question of whether the doped\npositive U Hubbard model may have a dx2 \u2212y2 superconducting ground state.\nThe Hamiltonian for a half-filled negative U Hubbard\nmodel in an external Zeeman field, H, can be written as\n\nH = \u2212t\n\nX\n\n(c\u2020is cjs + c\u2020js cis ) +\n\nhijis\n\n\u2212h\n\nX\n\nUX\n(ni\u2191 \u2212 ni\u2193 )2\n2 i\n\n(ni\u2191 \u2212 ni\u2193 ).\n\n(1)\n\ni\n\nHere t is a nearest neighbor one-electron hopping, U is\npositive so the onsite interaction is \u2212U ni\u2191 ni\u2193 and h =\ng\u03bc0 H/2. The operator c\u2020is creates a fermion with spin s\non site i, the sum hiji is over nearest neighbor sites of\n\na square lattice and nis = c\u2020is cis is the number operator.\nIn the case of the ultracold gases, a spin polarization\np = (N\u2191 \u2212 N\u2193 )/N is achieved by loading more atoms in\nthe \"up\" pseudo-spin hyperfine state than in the \"down\"\nstate.\nIn the mean-field FFLO state, the Cooper pairs have\na finite center of mass momentum which, for a two dimensional tight binding band structure, lays along the\n(1,0) or the (1,1) direction depending upon the ratio of\n|U |/t. For the case in which it lays along the (1,0) direction, the order parameter exhibits a one-dimensional\noscillation along the x direction\n\u2206(lx ) = Rehcl\u2191 cl\u2193 i = \u2212\u22060 cos(qx lx ).\n\n(2)\n\nHere we have chosen the phase so that \u2206(0) is negative.\nThe spin polarization also varies in space with\nns (lx ) = hnl\u2191 \u2212 nl\u2193 i = p \u2212 m0 cos(2qx lx ).\n\n(3)\n\nHere cos(qx lx ) and cos(2qx lx ) give the leading weak coupling harmonic behavior. The spatial variation of \u2206(lx )\nand ns (lx ) are schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. At\nstronger coupling higher harmonics can enter giving a\nmore localized behavior.\nSince the possibility of an FFLO state was originally\nproposed,7,8 there has been great interest in determining\nwhether it exists and exploring its properties. In particular, with the possibility of observing such a state in\nultracold atomic gases, there have been a number of theoretical calculations.15,16,17,18,19,20,21 These calculations\nhave been based upon a mean field description. Here we\nare interested in the case of a two-dimensional half-filled\nlattice gas where it is important to treat strong coupling\neffects. One would like to know if the FFLO state survives beyond the mean field approximation, whether the\n\n\f2\nstripes run vertically (or horizontally) as in Eqs. (2) and\n(3) or diagonally, and whether the periodicity of the spatial variation which determines qx remains at its mean\nfield value.\nThe Hamiltonian for the negative U Hubbard model\nin a Zeeman field can be transformed under a unitary\ntransformation to a doped positive U Hubbard model.\nThis transformation, introduced by Emery,11 has been a\nstaple in quantum Monte Carlo work where it was used to\nshow that the fermion sign problem is absent for the halffilled Hubbard model with a near-neighbor hopping.12\nIt has also been used, as we will review, to provide a\nmap between the half-filled negative U Hubbard model\nin a Zeeman field and the doped positive U Hubbard\nmodel.12,13,14,22 Under this transformation we will see\nthat the FFLO state becomes the familiar striped, charge\ndensity, and \u03c0-phase shifted antiferromagnetic state of\nthe doped positive U Hubbard model.\nFor a unitary transformation in which\ncl\u2191 \u2192 (\u22121)lx +ly d\u2020l\u2191\n\ncl\u2193 \u2192 dl\u2193\n\n(4)\n\nthe Hamiltonian given in Eq. (1) becomes\n\nH = \u2212t\n\nX\n\n(d\u2020is djs + d\u2020js dis ) +\n\nhijis\n\n(5)\n\n0.2\n0.1\n\nns\n\n0\n\u2206\n\n-0.1\n\n(a)\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0.1\n\nns\n\n0\n-0.2\n0\n\n\u2206\n\n(b)\n\n10\n\n5\nlx\n\nwith \u03bc = \u2212h. That is, the half-filled negative U Hubbard\nmodel with spin polarization p is mapped into a positive\nU Hubbard model with a site filling hni = 1 \u2212 p. Under\nthis transformation Eq. (2) becomes\n(6)\n\nwith Mx (l) = (d\u2020l\u2191 dl\u2193 + d\u2020l\u2193 dl\u2191 )/2. The system has rotational symmetry so that Eq. (6) implies that the staggered spin order is modulated by cos qx lx .\n(\u22121)lx +ly\nhn\u2191 (lx , ly ) \u2212 n\u2193 (lx , ly )i\n2\n= \u2212\u22060 cos qx lx .\n(7)\n\nmstag (lx ) =\n\nSimilarly, the spin polarization, Eq. (3), transforms to\nthe hole density giving\nh(lx ) = 1 \u2212 hn(lx , ly )i = p \u2212 m0 cos(2qx lx ).\n\n(9)\n\nfor such walls. A schematic illustration of the mean field\nresults for p = 0.125 is shown in Fig. 1a.\n\n-0.1\n\ni\n\n(\u22121)lx +ly hMx (lx , ly )i = \u2212\u22060 cos qx lx\n\nqx = \u03c0p.\n\n-0.2\n0\n0.2\n\nU X\n(ni\u2191 + ni\u2193 \u2212 1)2\n2\n\nX\n(ni\u2191 + ni\u2193 )\n\u2212\u03bc\n\nMean field studies13,23,24,25,26,27 of the doped, twodimensional positive U Hubbard model with a nearestneighbor hopping find that the domain-walls run along\nthe x or y-directions for |U |/t <\n\u223c 3.6. For values of\n3.6 <\n\u223c |U |/t <\n\u223c 8 the domain-walls run diagonally and\nfor |U |/t greater than 8 the domain-walls are found to\nbe unstable with respect to the formation of magnetic\npolarons.28 The mean field domain walls are found to\ncontain one hole per site along the wall and one says\nthat the domain wall is filled with holes. This means\nthat the spacing of the vertical (or horizontal) charged\ndomain walls is equal to p\u22121 , giving the mean field result\n\n(8)\n\nThus the FFLO state maps to the striped state of\nthe doped positive U Hubbard model in which charged\nstripes separate \u03c0-phase shifted antiferromagnetic regions.\n\nFIG. 1: (Color on line) Schematic results for the spatial variation of the s-wave order parameter \u2206(lx ) (solid) and the spin\npolarization ns (lx ) (dashed) in an FFLO state with p = 0.125.\n(a) The mean field result with a period for \u2206(lx ) of 2/p = 16\nand (b) with a period 1/p = 8 expected from DMRG calculations on long stripes.\n\nNow these are mean field results and at larger values of\nU one is dealing with a strongly correlated system. Thus\none might wonder whether the FFLO state remains the\nground state. This is a question that has also played\na central role in the high Tc cuprate problem. There\none would like to know if the ground state of the doped\nHubbard model is striped or possibly a dx2 \u2212y2 superconductor, and what is the nature of the interplay between stripes and pairing.29 Present DMRG calculations\non 6-leg Hubbard ladders find a striped ground state.9,10 ,\nwhile dynamic cluster Monte Carlo calculations30 on periodic lattices find evidence of a dx2 \u2212y2 superconducting\nstate. Whether the difference of lattice aspect ratios and\nboundary conditions or subtle numerical biases are responsible for this disagreement is not known. It does,\nhowever, appear that these two states are very close in energy. Here we will use the DMRG results for the striped\n\n\f3\nstate to discuss the nature of the FFLO state and then\nconclude by noting what would happen for the dx2 \u2212y2\nstate.\nThe DMRG calculations have been carried out on 6leg doped positive U Hubbard ladders. Periodic boundary conditions have been imposed in the 6-leg direction\nand open boundary conditions are used in the long xdirection. In Ref. 10, the results have been extrapolated to infinite length ladders. These numerical results\nfind that the ground state exhibits the striped structure\nshown in Fig. 2 for a 6 \u00d7 21 ladder with U/t = 12 and\n12 holes corresponding to a doping p = 2/21.

As discussed in the text, h(lx ) corresponds to the spin\npolarization ns (lx ) and mstag (lx ) corresponds to the s-wave\npairfield order parameter \u2206(lx ) of the FFLO state.\n\nCalculations on an 8-leg t \u2212 J ladder find that the\nstripes are half-filled and there is evidence that this is\nthe preferred filling.31 These calculations show that the\nholes that make up the stripe exhibit short range pairing\ncorrelations32 in which the sign of the singlet pair field\n\nassociated with two sites connected by a hopping perpendicular to the stripe is opposite to that of the case in\nwhich the hopping is parallel to the stripe. These d-wave\nlike pairing correlations of the holes in the stripe are not\ntaken into account in the mean field calculations which\nfind filled stripes. For half-filled stripes, the spacing between the charged stripes is 1/2p so that the numerical\ncalculations on the longer stripes imply that qx for the\nFFLO state will be twice that found in the mean field\ncalculations.\nqx = 2\u03c0p.\n\n(12)\n\nIn this case, the FFLO state will have half the spatial period of the mean field solution, as illustration in\nFig. 1b.\nHere we have made use of DMRG calculations which\nwere carried out on systems with periodic boundary conditions in one direction and open boundary conditions\nin the other. In cold atoms experiments, one is generally dealing with an underlying optical lattice in a slowly\nvarying trap potential which acts as a spatially dependent chemical potential. This leads to soft boundaries\nand the simultaneous coexistence of spatially separated\nphases. The details of this depend upon the total filling\nas well as the curvature of the confining trap potential.33\nIn principle, the DMRG method is well suited to treating\nsuch soft boundaries but here we have focused our discussion on the idealized case of a two-dimensional lattice\nwhich has one fermion per site with an attractive Feshbach tuned interaction and a spin polarization p. We\nhave shown that the FFLO state of a 2D half-filled attractive spin polarized Hubbard model is a unitary transform of the striped state of the doped repulsive Hubbard\nmodel. Thus an experimental observation of the FFLO\nstate in the above mentioned cold atom set-up would\nimply that the 2D doped repulsive Hubbard model is\nstriped. Note that we have not shown that the striped\nstate is the ground state of the two-dimensional doped\nrepulsive U Hubbard model. This remains an open question. We have simply shown that if the striped state were\nthe ground state then this would imply that the FFLO\nstate would be found in the optical lattice experiments\nand that its periodicity would be given by Eq. (12). We\nbelieve that the factor of two increase in qx represents\nan important change from the mean field result and reflects the tendency towards dx2 \u2212y2 pairing.32 Recent experiments also suggest that local pairing correlations are\npresent on the cuprate stripes.34\nFinding evidence for an FFLO state in a cold attractive\nspin polarized fermi lattice gas would provide evidence\nthat the low temperature phase of the doped positive\nU Hubbard model is striped. If on the other hand, the\ndx2 \u2212y2 superconducting state describes the low temperature phase of the repulsive Hubbard model, then the\ntransformation, Eq. (4), tells us that the cold atom system will exhibit a \"d-spin density wave\" ground state\ncharacterized by an order parameter\n\n\f4\n\nX\n\n(coskx \u2212 cosky )hc\u2020k+Q\u2191 ck\u2193 i\n\n(13)\n\nk\n\nwith Q = (\u03c0, \u03c0). Thus experiments on half-filled, spin\npolarized cold fermi lattice gases with attractive on site\ninteractions and the search for the FFLO state have important implications for the properties of the doped repulsive U Hubbard model. Likewise, our present understanding of the repulsive Hubbard model can provide information relevant to experiments on the spin polarized\nattractive fermi gas.\n\nexperimental work on cold fermion gases and L.
