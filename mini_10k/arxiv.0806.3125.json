MgB2 superconductor was\ndiscovered seven years ago [4], so far we also do not know\nwhat causes superconducting in this material. Most recently, the iron-based superconductors have been found\nby researchers in Japan and China [5, 6] has raised the\nhope that the new materials will help solve the mystery of\nhigh-Tc superconductorson, on the contrary, researchers\nnow appear to be more confused than ever about the\nfundamental mechanism of superconductivity. \"If it's really a new mechanism, God knows where it will go.\" says\nPhilip Anderson [7].\nAs is well known, the superconductivity is indeed a\nrather common phenomenon in nature. There are now\nseveral thousand materials showing the superconductivity. Correspondingly, physicists have developed many\ntheories and models on atomic level in attempts to pin\ndown the mechanism responsible for the observed superconducting phenomena in different materials. It seems\nas if a new superconductor always calls for a new superconducting mechanism. But this situation should not\ncontinue like that. It is time for the condensed matter\ncommunity to consider one important question: for different superconductors, there are different superconducting mechanisms, or there is only one unified mechanism?\nPersonally, I think that the latter case is a more reasonable possibility physically and naturally. The intrinsic\nmechanism of the superconductivity is at base simple and\ndeterminate, it is scientists themselves who have made\nthe problem more complex and not deterministic.\nRecently, we have proposed a real space spin-parallel\nmechanism of superconductivity which has successfully\nprovided coherent explanations to a number of complicated problems in conventional and non-conventional superconductors [8, 9, 10, 11, 12], for example, the local checkerboard patterns and \"magic doping fractions\"\nin La2\u2212x Srx CuO4 [8], the tetragonal vortex phase in\nBi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8 [9], the hexagonal vortex lattice and\ncharge carrier density in MgB2 [9], the optimal doping\nphases [12] and pressure effects [10] in the new iron-\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\nbased superconductors, and the 4a\u00d74a and 4 2a\u00d74 2a\ncheckerboard patterns in hole-doped Ca2\u2212x Nax CuO2 Cl2\n[11]. Although these results are in excellent agreement\nwith experiments, disappointingly, they have been totally\nneglected by the community.\nOn the other hand, despite recent attention and greater\nefforts to understand the FeAs superconductors, there\nis no consensus on the origin of the 'superconducting\nglue' that binds electrons into superconducting pairs. It\nshould be pointed out that most of the theoretical works\nare playing absolutely the same \"mathematical and numerical games\" which have been played intensively in\ncuprate superconductors. Undoubtedly, many theories\nabout electron pairing and superconducting in the ironbased superconductors may also be on the wrong track\n[3]. We insist that in order to have a deeper insight\ninto the forces responsible for Cooper pairs in the superconducting materials, the framework of k-space weakcoupling BCS theory should be abandoned and the original configuration of Cooper pairs (antiparallel spins and\nopposite momenta) should be modified [9].\nIn the present paper, we aim to improve the suggested\nunified superconducting theory [8, 9] and extend the application of the theory to the pairing mechanism (glue)\nand pseudogap phase in Fe-based superconductors.\nHow are two negatively charged electrons bound into\nCooper pairs in the iron-based superconductors? Theoretical and numerical studies have shown that superconductivity in these materials is associated with the FeAs\nlayer which can be further subdivided into\n\u221a a square Fe\nlattice with the Fe-Fe distance a = a0 / 2, where a0 is\nthe lattice parameter. The iron atoms are separated by\narsenic atoms above and below Fe plane. As shown in\nFig. 1, when two static electrons embedded symmetrically into two adjacent Fe plaquettes of the FeAs superconductor with a distance 2\u2206, there is a long-range\nrepulsive electron-electron Coulomb interaction\nfc =\n\ne2\n.\n4\u03c0\u03b50 (2\u2206)2\n\n(1)\n\nObviously, the two electrons cannot be naturally paired\ndue to this strong repulsion.

We presume that the real-space confinement effect (electromagnetic interactions) in FeAS plane\n(see Fig. 1) plays a central role in suppressing the influence of the Coulomb repulsion between electrons.

Based on\nthe analytical expressions (1)\u2212(7), we draw in Fig. 2 the\nconfinement force Fy versus \u2206 for LaO1\u2212x Fx FeAs. This\nfigure reveals one important fact: there are two special\npositions (\u2206 = 0.215a and 0.449a) where the localized\nCooper pair (characterized by a pseudogap) can survive\nin the superconductor.\nNow we present a brief discussion of the doping dependence of the pseudogap phenomenon. At a rather\nlow doping level, as shown in Fig. 3 (a), the interactions\namong electron pairs can be neglected and the pairs can\nmaintain their integrality (pseudogap phase) at a temperature T \u2217 which is higher than the superconducting\ntransition temperature Tc . With an increase in doping,\nthe effect of the competitive interactions among pairs\nwill emerge [see the lower right corner of Fig. 3 (b)].\nWhen the doping concentration reaches certain threshold values, the localized Cooper pairs (pseudogap phase)\nwill be destroyed instantly due to the strong interactions\namong the crowded Cooper pairs, as shown in Fig. 3 (b).\nIn other words, for a given temperature, excess charge\ncarrier concentrations in a superconducting material is\n\ninteraction\n\nFIG. 3: A schematic description of pseudogap and nonpseudogap in FeAs superconductor. (a) At a low doping sample with a minimum pair-pair distance \u03be > 10\u00c5 , the interactions among electron pairs can be neglected, indicating the\nexistence of the pseudogap, (b) at a high doping concentration (\u03be < 10\u00c5), inevitably, pseudogap phase will be destroyed\nby the strong interactions among the crowded Cooper pairs.\n\nharmful for pseudogap phase.\nIn an earlier article [9], we showed that the charge carrier density for a doped superconductor is given by\n\u03c1s =\n\n2\nx\n=\n,\nABC\nabc\n\n(8)\n\nwhere x is the doping level, (a, b, c) and (A, B, C) are\nthe constants lattice (atoms) and superlattice (electrons)\nconstants [9], respectively. From Eq. (8), for a bulk\nsuperconducting materials, we can define a parameter\n\n\f4\n(the average pair-pair distance \u03be) as follows\nr\n2\n.\n\u03be3d = 3\n\u03c1s\n\n(9)\n\nFor the quasi-two-dimensional layered superconductors\n(c \u226b a, b), we can define\nr\nr\nr\n2\n2ab\n2\n=\n\u2248a\n.\n(10)\n\u03be2d =\nc\u03c1s\nx\nx\nThe above parameters of Eqs. (9) and (10) can\nbe used as the criteria for the existence of pseudogap\nphase in the superconductors. Many experimental results\nhave indicated the existence of the pseudogap phases\nin the underdoped cuprate and FeAs superconductors,\nfor example, La2\u2212x Srx CuO4 (LSCO, x = 0.15) [13] and\nLaO1\u2212x Fx FeAs (LOFFA, x = 0.07) [14]. However, researchers find no experimental evidence for the pseudogap in conventional and MgB2 superconductors. The nature of the pseudogap phase is still highly controversial.\nThere are many models attempt to describe the mysterious pseudogap state. Strictly speaking, none of the\nproposed models is completely satisfactory. As discussion above, here we present a new approach based on the\nsimple and natural picture of the real-space confinement\neffect of Fig. 1, and the pseudogap is associated with\nthe local structure and the charge carrier density in the\nsuperconductors.\nAccording to the experimental data and Eqs. (8) and\n(10), the average pair-pair distances for La2\u2212x Srx CuO4\n(x = 0.15) and LaO1\u2212x Fx FeAs (x = 0.07) are \u03beLSCO \u223c\n13.88\u00c5 and \u03beLOF F A \u223c 15.23\u00c5, respectively. But MgB2\n(a = b = 3.086\u00c5, c = 3.524\u00c5 and \u03c1s = 1.49\u00d71022/cm3 =\n1.49 \u00d7 10\u22122/\u00c53 [9]) superconductor has a relatively small\n\u03beMgB \u223c 6.17\u00c5, which indicates a much strong pairpair interaction (\u221d \u03be \u22122 ) in the system. Here, we argue that when \u03be < 10\u00c5, the pair-pair interactions are\n\nstrong enough to break up the electron pairs, and eventually closes the pseudogap in the sample. Normally, the\nvalue of the average pair-pair distance satisfies \u03be < 5\u00c5\nin the conventional superconductors, thus it should not\nbe surprising about the non-pseudogap behavior in these\nmaterials.\nIn conclusion, it is found that the Coulombic interaction can play a key role for pairing glue for the iron-based\nlayered superconductors. The mechanism reveals the existence of the pseudogap in a low doping FeAs sample\n(underdoped), which is in satisfactory agreement with recent experiment. Furthermore, we have introduced a criterion which can be applied to distinguish whether or not\nthe pseudogap can open in a material. Finally, it should\nbe emphasized that the suggested mechanism responsible\nfor the pseudogap is not specific to the iron-based family\nand it may also be applicable to other superconducting\nand even non-superconducting materials.\n\n\u2217\nElectronic address: xqhuang@nju.edu.cn\n[1] J.
